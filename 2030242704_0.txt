[1:44:50] Whacklocker: What server is this? I started like 2 days ago, SoD looks awesome for a boomer like me, dont have to play 24/7
[1:45:26] spookyelectric: What do you think about troll priest for pvp in SOD? there was a lot of discussion during classic days about shadowguard being so good because of the damage, spell pushback, blackout and shadow weavin
[1:45:42] racerkill: official private funserver :)
[1:45:49] valaistv: ngl SoD is a blast
[1:46:03] Whacklocker: Last real fun i had in wow was in MOP, those were the good days
[1:46:06] valaistv: although hutners should be nerfed :D
[1:47:00] Gunnolfz: cant wait for the viper sting rune
[1:47:31] spookyelectric: ud still better though?
[1:47:33] CremDeLaCrop: priest got nerfed too hard imo. shoulda been slight adjustment. and why touch circle of healing? man wtf
[1:48:29] Whacklocker: Im gonna start a priest, was the healing nerf bad? 20% isnt that big is it, when the numbers are pretty small
[1:48:44] Seilou: and hunters got a buff BuddhaBar
[1:49:00] Mystylerocks: good evening!
[1:49:10] valaistv: never heared of a hunter buff
[1:49:19] CremDeLaCrop: maybe pom nerf was justified. I think penance coulda used a softer adjustment
[1:49:25] cyanne112: still a nerf overall
[1:50:00] Whacklocker: Was gonna ask one thing about priest if you dont mind, when it comes to PoM, i saw alot of ppl say use renew r1 to proc it if stuck, but isnt it better to use lesser heal r1
[1:50:11] CremDeLaCrop: I strictly use circl of heal for turtle boss in BFD
[1:50:54] yaaksha: You need WG
[1:51:00] yaaksha: And Nature's Grasp
[1:51:00] Mystylerocks: @Whacklocker it depends on the situation right? sometimes u want the insta cast, some times u can spare a cast
[1:51:09] cyanne112: idk man they tried to buff "shadow" and managed to make priests even more oppressive in pvp. the healing nerf seems warranted from both pvp and pve perspective
[1:51:11] pweepysonkun: yeah WG is op
[1:51:12] yaaksha: You need Sealion Form
[1:51:13] valaistv: tailo or lw epic on balance druids?
[1:51:24] Nuoluoski: Renew can proc multiple PoMs
[1:51:31] Nuoluoski: Lesser heal can't
[1:52:16] Graffz: Graffz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:52:22] yaaksha: I think tailoring is slightly better @valaistv especially if you get Slick Fingerless Gloves
[1:52:25] spookyelectric: even if there is no racial swaps (at least ofr now) do you still think undead is better than troll for pvp?
[1:53:13] Whacklocker: That makes sense, i didnt know that renew didn't proc PoM if full hp
[1:53:18] Whacklocker: Thats why i didnt get it to work alot

[1:55:13] the_moist_factory: you can do them at any order
[1:55:17] valaistv: 1 in duskwood, one in ashenvale and one in hilsbrad
[1:55:19] moneyshotx_: statues are annoying. one in duskwood, one in ashenvale, last in hillsbrad
[1:55:19] numero5218: havenâ€™t done it on my lock

[1:59:49] the_moist_factory: low
[1:59:55] Whacklocker: abit low
[1:59:57] valaistv: now
[2:00:04] numero5218: fine to me lil low
[2:00:09] numero5218: good

[2:00:28] numero5218: quality seems same as always
[2:00:50] valaistv: it was sounding good, just different
[2:00:58] misstherese: it was a little crispy before
[2:01:18] yaaksha: Yeah loot that + the one in Silverpine, then go back to Moonglade
[2:01:35] yaaksha: I haven't done the Cure Poison one on main I cba, I get Abolish Poison at lvl 26

[2:03:46] CremDeLaCrop: I shoulda gone cow on my warrior
[2:03:54] CremDeLaCrop: feel like orc racial dont proc on hoj
[2:04:31] RettiTBC: It surely does @CremDeLaCrop
[2:05:03] Arjibhaji: Can confirm I've resisted HoJ as an orc
[2:05:33] Atlas62: starsurge having a 15% chance to stun next phase will be nuts
[2:05:57] racerkill: yeah but it has cd
[2:06:11] racerkill: but stunned for 42 yards is still something
[2:06:16] Atlas62: or boomys with moonkin form and survival rune
[2:06:17] Atlas62: so tanky
[2:06:45] cyanne112: back in classic i felt my orc racial just DIDNT WORK... until i got a WA showing the resists, and ofc i was wrong about it
[2:06:50] cyanne112: it's just subjective AF
[2:07:09] cyanne112: imp starfire
[2:07:13] cyanne112: -0.5
[2:07:19] yaaksha: The stun
[2:07:23] yaaksha: ye
[2:07:34] Atlas62: boomy form having as much armor as improved bear form is nuts
[2:07:59] Deaddovedonoteat: Resist happens instantly, so i would reckon thats when the stun happens
[2:08:51] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[2:08:58] cyanne112: sadly boomkins have ZERO scaling so the dmg will be shit
[2:09:06] Deaddovedonoteat: Its impossible to look like an idiot in boomkin form
[2:09:10] yaaksha: No WG in Moonkin form
[2:09:17] Cupz21: moonkin has amazing scaling
[2:09:19] racerkill: is moonkin form even good? you cant even do the instant heals
[2:09:23] Cupz21: starfire has 1 to 1 SP
[2:09:29] yaaksha: Might just go Dreamstate build
[2:09:31] Cupz21: and when crits gets .5 off next cast
[2:09:33] jezzi23: Surely they will do something for moonkin form in p2
[2:09:41] Cupz21: problem is they do low damage and they have no AOE
[2:09:42] Vazcoll: Vazcoll subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:09:44] rqnim: play moonglow build pogU
[2:09:48] valaistv: dreamstate is in balance mate
[2:09:53] Cupz21: dreamstate is TBC
[2:09:58] Cupz21: mana isnt an issue
[2:10:04] valaistv: wait
[2:10:04] dreeeamyy: good evening
[2:10:05] valaistv: its not there
[2:10:07] valaistv: WTF
[2:10:07] yaaksha: Talent isn't in but will go some Resto / Balance hybrid
[2:10:09] Deaddovedonoteat: skip moonkin, where are we putting our 6 value points
[2:10:10] hehecev: Dreamstate is BC lmao
[2:10:21] Cupz21: the only issue with moonkin is the damage is low. I was number 1 moonkin in classic on WCL
[2:10:24] dreeeamyy: any horror hype tonight or tomorrow ?!
[2:10:27] Cupz21: because I was dumb
[2:11:09] racerkill: youll probably get moonkin form but just not use it most of the time
[2:11:12] cyanne112: moonfury is just BASE DMG
[2:11:20] cyanne112: so doesnt add much when you start getting SP
[2:11:25] valaistv: i dont think there  is a reason to skip moonkin fgorm
[2:11:59] rqnim: There'll be a rune "you can now cast regrowth in shapeshift" Aware
[2:12:21] yaaksha: Yeah need a good Moonkin Rune
[2:12:28] jezzi23: Why is starsurge even 1.0 coef? it's so random and not consistent with anything else :P
[2:12:42] valaistv: imagine boomy getting typhoon
[2:12:59] Cupz21: they need starfall and hurricane buff rune
[2:13:08] Cupz21: as well as starfire being buffed on dmg
[2:13:38] Cupz21: nothing else matters honestly outside some crazy random rune
[2:13:48] valaistv: stun on starsurge gonna be massive aswell
[2:14:09] cyanne112: are we sure its gonna proc it?
[2:14:41] cyanne112: "most talents and effects"
[2:14:53] rfourt: !addon
[2:14:55] the_moist_factory: yeah
[2:14:55] rfourt: !addons
[2:14:55] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vm4aSwoKQ
[2:14:58] the_moist_factory: its cool
[2:14:59] ElJackmanno: Yes it works
[2:15:11] Dariannz: why does starfire do so little dmg compared to the instant nuke
[2:15:25] Dariannz: feel like it shud do a bit more
[2:15:25] cyanne112: because starfire is like lvl 20 spell\
[2:15:28] valaistv: they prlly gonan tweak damage later on
[2:15:30] rfourt: yooo whats the addon that shows the dmg in the icon?
[2:16:19] valaistv: its becouse starfire is dog rn, they temporary fixed balanced dmg issus by buffing starsurge way too much
[2:16:34] cyanne112: wrath and the chest rune is kinda useless once you get nature's grace, at least in pve
[2:16:37] valaistv: but yeah it needs further adjusting
[2:16:44] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: what new runes would you like in p2 for balance/resto
[2:17:06] atarri1: lmao that was brutal
[2:17:37] jgarcia95az: starfall
[2:17:47] CremDeLaCrop: starfal ez
[2:17:55] yaaksha: Starfall but every star is a Starsurge
[2:18:02] valaistv: plz no starfall
[2:18:08] numero5218: I feel like there arenâ€™t many locks around anymore or is that just me
[2:18:24] Arjibhaji: Maokai ult equiv could be fun

[2:19:18] ElJackmanno: Cyclone kekw
[2:19:18] yaaksha: The root from the Ashevale bosses

[2:24:00] valaistv: 100% getting soloed by pet is worst feeling ever
[2:24:13] finntard: bm is just garbage design
[2:24:17] Deaddovedonoteat: yea, its west of moonglade
[2:24:38] Ziil01: Hello. how many characters do you playing now?
[2:24:53] mokabear: What server is this druid on

[2:25:13] Arjibhaji: Wyvern yeah for SV
[2:25:19] mokabear: Thought so, you're dead to me
[2:25:21] mokabear: Good day, sir
[2:25:37] Arjibhaji: 11 pt
[2:26:04] finntard: nah
[2:26:12] valaistv: bestial wrath timeouts you every time you use it
[2:26:12] finntard: then u couldnt run survival + aimed :(
[2:26:13] valaistv: yes, please
[2:26:19] mokabear: They're just gonna keep nerfing BM until MM is better, I feel like
[2:26:34] CremDeLaCrop: ya I like the idea of adding additional things to the last talent tier
[2:27:26] Arjibhaji: I'm hopinh they do some fun stuff for SV for p2
[2:27:32] mokabear: Literally says Shrine of Remulos on map
[2:27:34] mokabear: LOL
[2:27:42] sebastian_x69: @Hydramist im both glad druid and hunter retail , so its hard to decide
[2:28:02] CremDeLaCrop: Id like to see lock get UA too
[2:28:02] mokabear: @sebastian_x69 go hunter, it's more fun. Get a crab
[2:28:27] finntard: tbc survival is best design ever
[2:28:33] sebastian_x69: @mokabear tried druid too? boomy?
[2:28:37] Arjibhaji: Yeah - Id want more accessible CC and some kinda tweak to traps etc
[2:28:54] mokabear: @sebastian_x69 i'm a resto main right now but it's a little poop. Boomking isn't even worth talking about
[2:29:13] valaistv: traps in combat would be huge
[2:29:13] yaaksha: Survival runes should make you play like Rexxar
[2:29:53] Deaddovedonoteat: to 3 places LUL
[2:29:56] mokabear: Southshore, Ashenvale and Duskwood for Wildgrowth
[2:29:58] Chickqt: @hydramist trinket pearl with heal or dps as disc?
[2:30:00] valaistv: You need to get 3 owls. 1 in hilsbrad foothills, 1 in duskwood and 1 in ashenvale
[2:30:32] sebastian_x69: @mokabear starsurge though? :D
[2:30:39] valaistv: the order doesnt matter, those are 3 'challanges'
[2:30:40] mokabear: @sebastian_x69 yeah, that's broken
[2:30:45] valaistv: in hilsbrad you swin between 2 islands
[2:30:54] Deaddovedonoteat: you simply needed  aqua form to be able to get the hillsbrad one
[2:31:00] finntard: need aqua form for the rune
[2:31:00] valaistv: in duskwood you go to twilight groove, click statue then go north-east above worgens
[2:31:02] mokabear: You can get them all now, yeah. Probably at 24. Don't fuck around in Hillsbrad, you have about 8 seconds leeway
[2:31:02] valaistv: kill bear
[2:31:04] valaistv: no
[2:31:10] valaistv: you get quest when you get 1st owl
[2:31:11] xbigyetix: no
[2:31:13] mokabear: You just turn in, don't hand to hand in anything
[2:31:18] yaaksha: No but need to do it in order from Ashenvale first
[2:31:23] finntard: you need aqua form
[2:31:25] mokabear: Yes, you do need aquatic form LOL
[2:31:25] valaistv: yes you do need aquatic form
[2:31:28] finntard: not sure if possible with potion
[2:31:29] xbigyetix: you can collect all the owls without the quest.
[2:31:30] valaistv: to complete hilsbrad challange
[2:31:37] xbigyetix: but you will need seal form
[2:31:40] mokabear: @finntard it's not, you'll miss it
[2:31:54] valaistv: ashenvale is just defeat 3 weaves of 2x 25lvl mobs
[2:32:05] mokabear: If you play alliance on living flame, I will gift you a sub for ganking this man in ashenvale
[2:32:20] valaistv: idk, design is cool but its real pita
[2:32:41] mokabear: Because you're not using cat form to run
[2:32:47] Chickqt: the perl trinket. which1 do i take as disc? dps or heal?
[2:33:18] Mystylerocks: @Chickqt id take the dmg, suits fine for both pvp and pve
[2:33:29] finntard: dmg for sure
[2:33:36] mokabear: Wait, this is a hack way to run to Splintertree
[2:33:38] varatupaj: @mokabear but with moonkin you dont have move speed on cat form
[2:33:41] mokabear: I've always run up from Barrens...
[2:33:50] finntard: raid so easy no need to go full healing
[2:33:54] Chickqt: tyty kiss
[2:34:03] rotbodi: did you quit fortnite?
[2:34:09] jigsawz_ttv: just go dps it will better for lvling in p2
[2:34:32] mokabear: I always get ganked on the Barrens run up
[2:34:48] valaistv: check the owl location, its on the path to splitertree post
[2:35:53] finntard: cheeky block :D

[2:38:24] gia__: you kinda need aquatic form to finish wild growth though
[2:38:27] finntard: huh
[2:38:34] mokabear: People are begging to see your gear
[2:38:41] Frig0z: That was also my answer to my wife on the 2nd one... it's so much work I swear
[2:38:41] gandalfowich: how much honor do you need for rank 3?
[2:38:42] jigsawz_ttv: you think with that penance nerf it will be time for SWD for p2 shadow?
[2:38:54] valaistv: no

[2:39:07] valaistv: stick to road for now
[2:39:09] gia__: stay on the road until you see an entrance
[2:39:18] Sinostra: btw, I forgot to ask yesterday : did the penance nerf affect its damage aswell ?
[2:39:39] valaistv: no
[2:39:39] mokabear: No
[2:39:41] mokabear: Do not go there
[2:39:43] gia__: not this
[2:39:45] valaistv: its gonna have darnassus like flag
[2:39:46] gia__: further
[2:39:54] mokabear: There
[2:39:54] jigsawz_ttv: yeah but pulling you out of form every time is worth?
[2:39:56] mokabear: Go there
[2:40:02] mokabear: Yeah, run down
[2:40:28] mokabear: Down by Elune's light
[2:40:34] hubris_69: Wonder if shadow is able to compete in pve, tested mind sear in bfd and it did decent dmg :o

[2:50:29] Cupz21: penpom
[2:50:30] valaistv: did you reach exalted with warsong outriders on your main? how long does it take
[2:50:42] optik_rec0rds: death homies
[2:50:47] Adm________: penpom, full heal, let no one dies in your team, drives ennemy crazy
[2:50:55] gia__: leatrix does most of that stuff
[2:50:57] piouspectre: Pen home
[2:51:05] awok1245: server ?
[2:51:31] cyanne112: SWD for the big pump vanilla montage
[2:51:31] west_vktr: DEATH HOMIES
[2:51:32] gia__: leatrix can hide clock / group icons etc
[2:51:43] finntard: 3 priest so homies should be fine?
[2:52:01] finntard: druid can get more
[2:52:01] west_vktr: Hydra - what do you think of the state of BGs atm? With it being impossible to queue as solo
[2:52:05] finntard: from belt
[2:52:06] sebastian_x69: @Hydramist think you'll beat mages P2?
[2:52:14] Adm________: invoker's belt, thats it pretty much
[2:52:15] Sinostra: you could get more from belt and shoulders
[2:52:32] Vosstrilian: The only way to get more i think is the Wizard cap then 2 piece tier chest and boots
[2:52:35] Sinostra: the craft shoulders get 7
[2:52:40] hubris_69: Is warlock still gonna be the hardest 1v1 matchup for shadow priest, or do we have other contenders?
[2:54:19] sebastian_x69: @Hydramist as ally would you always go gnome as mage? its so ugly :S

[2:56:42] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[2:56:51] finntard: they should add random bg que for 5man max for lower honor gain and then leave spesific ques open for premades ithink
[2:57:22] west_vktr: Yeah - whatever helps being able to casually pvp as a solo in WSG
[2:57:30] CremDeLaCrop: I think rated BGs would help a lot
[2:57:43] valaistv: 5-man queues are not the answer. It was like that years ago and people just made 2 groups queue at the same time

[5:09:29] Mpowerd: How do you even heal now?
[5:09:43] energydranks: Was there some kind of rank 1 renew pom tech? i don't play priest

[5:12:51] Mpowerd: I saw the other day some unded priest ganking wetlands, be careful
[5:13:12] tyneetym: I grouped with a shaman healer for a raid and PoM with Healing Rain was insanely good healing hah
[5:13:36] ImOdyssey: @Mpowerd lmaoo
[5:14:04] andyloltv: @Mpowerd was prob me lol
[5:14:22] matuzgotv: What will be the best healer in p2 predictions? :)
[5:14:26] isheria: boat always waits for 1min
[5:14:28] Mystiggo: apparently in WSG, healing rain makes you tag every target that anyone healed by healing rain tags

[5:15:17] senyapichlol: server?
[5:15:35] v3lik: u gonna make charapter stuck skip to ironforge?
[5:16:10] Mystiggo: how do you think they will balance VT if it's added
[5:16:16] Mystiggo: has to do more dmg than VP right? since it has a cast
[5:16:28] lnaishingi: did u make characters on multiple accounts before living flame got locked?

[5:17:16] Mystiggo: I just wonder. Maybe they want to give spriest a chance in pve
[5:17:45] Mystiggo: but then if VT does giga dam
[5:17:52] Mystiggo: one set of dots will absolutely melt anyone
[5:17:55] tyneetym: I wonder how Vampiric Embrace will work with Mind Sear lol
[5:18:07] tyneetym: since they have never existed at the same time pre nerf
[5:18:42] Xtreme078: Hey dude, can you tell what SoD is all about ?
[5:19:38] TyMULLY: @Xtreme078 its awesome
[5:20:03] gamerwatcher77: I hope they will not nerf priest even more, its very fun right now

[5:20:27] Josephxdxp: u doing hardcore?
[5:21:59] jcurt03: Do you think Spriest would be better if their DoTs were balanced around say.. half their current duration? 9 sec dots etc
[5:22:10] cajli: what server is this?
[5:22:23] jcurt03: Spriest dps
[5:22:25] jcurt03: in pve
[5:22:28] jcurt03: oh
[5:23:07] jcurt03: I just figured 18sec DoTs don't really jive with such fast paced trash and boss fights
[5:23:34] Mystiggo: I guess it's possible that blizzard aims to still make shadow mostly an utility spec. Homies kind of speak for that
[5:23:48] Mystiggo: so you'll do half the dmg of actual classes but provide other things
[5:24:30] trickzboy: What is the most op class for pvp as of now ?
[5:24:33] Mystiggo: I mean I played shadow for all of TBC and didn't mind being a mana battery
[5:24:48] Mystiggo: felt useful even if I did shit dmg compared to other casters
[5:25:21] vrsswow: Sup bro...i watched the clip its NUTZ
[5:25:48] vrsswow: 1v7 is that one
[5:27:14] vrsswow: i have so much lough when you in mid duel said "brb leme kill hunter fast"
[5:27:31] vrsswow: laugh^
[5:27:36] seraph_wow: ayo
[5:27:55] gamerwatcher77: I don't think Spriest will just be utility class, i think they will make it strong

[5:28:52] vrsswow: Watch it guys its NUTZ
[5:28:55] jcurt03: I wish priest had a bit more movement speed like feather or some thing
[5:29:56] jcurt03: Hell yeah. That's the kind of stuff they need to start pushing out, QOL stuff like movement
[5:30:21] jcurt03: they basically already did for rogue though
[5:30:28] vmttmv: but rogues have step already kinda
[5:30:29] jcurt03: with that one ability from stealth
[5:30:36] jcurt03: yeah
[5:30:40] jcurt03: or get a restealth
[5:30:49] bigfrankwow: shadowstrike is pure trash
[5:30:59] gamerwatcher77: In any case for pve for sure Spriest will be a monster in PVP
[5:31:06] jcurt03: it's almost more OP in a way... it's a shadow step that's up as much as you can get a restealth
[5:31:17] jcurt03: true
[5:32:09] jcurt03: Are priests and warriors the ONLY classes without some kind of movement speed in talents, etc.
[5:32:19] jcurt03: oh and Locks I guess
[5:32:27] xSomeLameNamex: i hope man. all i've wanted is to play spriest since hearing about SoD
[5:32:38] gamerwatcher77: Well in SOD we do more pvp then pve because we only have one raid per phase right now
[5:33:00] yaaksha: @Hydramist Randle Alt Raid on Monday sign up on Discord

[5:37:39] physicx_x: Mage with ice block and ice barrier
[5:37:52] jcurt03: BM Hunter with Bestial Wrath
[5:38:05] Mpa88: You've mentioned ele sham.
[5:38:13] physicx_x: Rogue get cheap shot, blind, kidney
[5:38:16] Mpa88: Before
[5:38:22] jcurt03: Ooh what if they give priests Mass Dispell
[5:38:37] Larr_y_: warlocks are always good

[5:38:50] seraph_wow: have some puff m8
[5:39:01] zobew: Is this eu or na servers
[5:39:08] jcurt03: and they don't get death coil until 42

[5:39:55] dereondra: idk i think siphon life, drain life, haunt going to be pog
[5:39:56] varatupaj: @Larr_y_ if you put at least 1, you wont get sl
[5:40:19] dereondra: i think deep affliction is the actual play
[5:40:41] dereondra: meta is kekw imo
[5:40:55] jcurt03: maybe if they itemize more spellpower locks will be op
[5:41:14] seraph_wow: ryan is making a full crit meme priest alt worth you think for fun(DF)
[5:41:54] Larr_y_: crocs are a strong shoe Kappa
[5:42:15] dereondra: a lot of people dont like rotting/lame style so i can see some going SL  destro
[5:42:19] xSomeLameNamex: best time to try
[5:42:26] xSomeLameNamex: well, maybe a few weeks ago but still
[5:42:30] xSomeLameNamex: can even try a few classes
[5:42:34] jcurt03: max lvl 25 feels easy
[5:42:43] jcurt03: in a good way

[5:45:07] kottessontv: hi hydra
[5:45:09] vrsswow: I hope they dont fk up Boomys in next phase ... iam having a blast with boomy,never ever played boomy i mean druid in general and i enjoy so much atm
[5:45:29] pecansedan: What are you downranking in the raid as a priest. New to healing.
[5:45:45] kottessontv: Rogue inc ;)?
[5:46:08] kottessontv: haha priest??? wand .-- wand ---- wand
[5:46:11] vrsswow: i mean my Main is Priest who gets outgeared by my Boomy but i wana keep playing Priest as main and Boomy aswell
[5:46:13] aljt95: haha, melee classes are torrid to level
[5:46:17] physicx_x: Yeah rogue is one of the worst to level
[5:46:17] aljt95: you've been spoilt playing priest
[5:46:19] xSomeLameNamex: lol. saberslash helps for sure
[5:46:26] kottessontv: at low lvl mate:D
[5:46:27] hemsho: i lvled every class to 25 and rogue was by far the worst
[5:46:28] xSomeLameNamex: but rogue leveling sub 20 sucks
[5:46:53] Cypagex: hey man, returning player here started with SoD 1,5 week ago. warrior main for now and lvling up alt hunter. Outta those, which class would you say looks more promising in P2? @hydramist
[5:47:48] mickster111: Would you suggest POM or Homunculous?
[5:47:54] pecansedan: Thanks :)
[5:48:00] kottessontv: i got rogue , lock at 25 , lock is rly fun =)  and lvling a warr atm
[5:48:38] ArtyomTrityak: What do you think about druid healers?
[5:51:35] mickster111: Do you ever use shield on the turtle?
[5:51:36] physicx_x: Is this priest on pvp server ?
[5:51:40] Mystiggo: if you have circle of healing, it's a lot of fun for turtle boss. especially since you have almost infinite mana from the bubbles
[5:51:44] Noted1010: Is Undead more superior than troll for Priest?
[5:51:47] gamerwatcher77: sorry to ask why you should use flash i always use it
[5:51:55] vrsswow: How i get into druid ...was pissed fishing with my mage coz every druid swim faster then i can run+blink or swim...then i created Druid just to farm like fishing and farm ... and all of a sudden i see Hydra playing Boomy Benseven owning ppl with 1 fkin spell Starsurge i had to try it and i fall in love
[5:52:00] mickster111: Thanks!
[5:52:14] virrtre: u never use circle of healing?
[5:52:19] physicx_x: Why human instead of dwarf ? :)
[5:52:25] Cypagex: @hydramist warrior or hunter for pvp in p2? iyo
[5:52:30] Mystiggo: circle of healing is really only worth it for turtle boss atm
[5:52:39] Mystiggo: will see more use later on almost certainly
[5:53:17] vrsswow: So i blame Hydra for my love for Boomys - Benseven is the reason :)
[5:53:18] hemsho: man im so excited to play shadow and not heal raids anymore :D
[5:53:35] varatupaj: i think an easy solution to turtle aoe, just ask warlock to give healthstones to everyone before the fight
[5:54:09] ero__oce: imagine being able to have perception and stoneform :D
[5:55:23] shierak16: wtf show us
[5:55:39] physicx_x: Why do you went human instead of dwarf?
[5:56:16] mickster111: Will holy be better than disc in any point in sod?

[5:57:18] virrtre: wow that ould be relly fun
[5:57:26] vrsswow: No Priest will be always main but i kinda hate that my priest is unlycky when it comes to gear this is 5th reset that got zero item on my priest,no that iam loosing on roll dont even drop items that i need on priest
[5:57:45] vrsswow: and my boomy is 3 items away from Bis  wrist glove belt thats it
[5:57:54] Lyna22: Being able to switch priest racial, is that a sure info?
[5:59:22] yaaksha: @vrsswow I need wrist belt ring on my Moonkin for BIS
[5:59:27] yaaksha: Same boat
[5:59:42] yaaksha: Got the belt on my Shaman :/
[5:59:45] Dmnlol: @Hydramist which addon shows how much hp the enemy has?
[5:59:47] yaaksha: Never seen it on either Druid

[6:01:37] jujujay_myalias: Good answer
[6:01:38] varatupaj: :D
[6:01:43] aljt95: he'd be unreal if he could defend
[6:01:47] vrsswow: If u are liverpool fan like iam - STEVEN GERARD is one to go there will be no one like him
[6:02:05] vimovo: lad can't defend for his life though
[6:02:05] Sinostra: Hey, i'm back, what have I missed ?
[6:02:10] aljt95: i don't like him though he shushed us at the etihad lol
[6:02:10] jarlike: He do hit the ball hard!
[6:02:25] jarlike: me to
[6:02:27] ero__oce: milner
[6:02:41] jarlike: love hard working midfieldes
[6:03:09] piouspectre: what you think of Hendo
[6:03:18] aljt95: he's just a yorkshireman, grafter
[6:04:07] jarlike: Gonna be a fun last few months if you support premier league
[6:04:20] jarlike: man city aston villa  arsenal liverpool
[6:04:30] jarlike: so many teams
[6:04:54] jarlike: city is the big one still.
[6:04:54] aljt95: yeah they have, just earlier this season
[6:05:00] Mystiggo: Don't have any emotional ties to Aston Villa but big respect to what Emery has managed to do with that squad
[6:05:14] jarlike: and now with kdb and haaland back
[6:05:15] Mystiggo: Saw glimpses of it last season
[6:05:15] Anciexnt: do you miss harry
[6:05:33] aljt95: villa beat us and arsenal in the space of a week they're quality
[6:06:03] aljt95: at home they're very strong
[6:06:46] achilees17: New to horde priest, is undead the best pvp race?
[6:06:53] jarlike: Imagine  if Nunez start scoring..
[6:07:09] achilees17: Thanks
[6:07:18] aljt95: nunez = juandy carroll
[6:07:29] jarlike: he is a part of the starting 11 for a reason
[6:07:35] piouspectre: had to get rid of him from my fantasy
[6:07:42] piouspectre: almost instant
[6:07:50] jarlike: How many death poly in a game doese he set up?
[6:08:25] diarrerik: dispel the disease before i loose my mind
[6:08:45] jarlike: most Big chanse sscorer in the leage
[6:08:50] jarlike: haaland 2nd
[6:08:52] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[6:09:24] jarlike: meant that he misses the most big scoring chanses
[6:09:39] l3oxi: I always enjoy watching the highlights of Man Utd games just thinking to myself, are they gonna fuck this game up as well?
[6:10:05] jarlike: does any of the orignal trio you started to pvp play beside you
[6:10:15] diarrerik: i feel like nunez could be really good. good pace and tenacity. question is if he will start scoring from all the chances he gets or not
[6:10:30] Cupz21: !restedxp

[6:10:44] jarlike: kalimist and the mage.
[6:10:54] Mystiggo: The question is can you teach that finishers ruthlessness
[6:10:59] Mystiggo: that someone like Suarez had
[6:11:01] jarlike: yea. haha
[6:11:22] yaaksha: I'm playing SoD with Kali atm, he's levelling a Hunter atm
[6:11:41] yaaksha: Yeah he's got like every class at this point I think
[6:11:54] Mystiggo: that's brutal
[6:12:02] Mystiggo: be lvl 22. "grind to lvl 24"
[6:12:38] yaaksha: What class
[6:12:46] Mystiggo: when you buy a 500 euro guide and it tells you to "just grind to max level" Kappa
[6:12:54] jarlike: favorite expansion?
[6:13:15] jarlike: also in hindsight?
[6:14:36] Mystiggo: My Ideal version of the game would be a tasteful TBC+
[6:14:45] Mystiggo: but good luck getting Blizzard to pull that off
[6:14:52] yaaksha: Imagine if SoD continues in to TBC, the dream
[6:14:58] jarlike: when you have the game knowlege you got know
[6:15:12] yaaksha: Yeah that too
[6:15:32] Drunk_Mantis: really excited to see what they do with SoD at 60 and beyond (if anythng)
[6:15:36] yaaksha: They could do some stuff with Infinite Dragonflight and split the timeline, give us some non-canon alternative world
[6:15:50] jarlike: did pandaworld end  the pvp scene or make it better as you see
[6:16:36] jarlike: I rember i loved the big numbers but it made it all diffrent
[6:16:37] realityshift17: I know next to nothing about sod but looking to get into it, is/will there be arena at some point?
[6:16:59] Zelimeth: mortuary assistant when
[6:17:04] DeltaDarce: Can you talk about how your action bar changes depending on who you're targeting
[6:17:27] Zelimeth: them 100 viewers are the real ones
[6:18:27] koopsertankman: yo bro whats the addon what shows enemys buffs vanilla feels aids without it
[6:19:11] koopsertankman: cheers
[6:19:48] mickster111: You think the STV pvp will be worth it?  Ashenvale is meh...
[6:19:48] moistspeedo: is this on lonewolf eu?
[6:20:13] Drunk_Mantis: the STV idea is goated
[6:20:14] Essageo: explain
[6:20:16] piouspectre: love the stv idea and u should say it again
[6:23:04] hemsho: cringe as a warrior, good as a stealth class
[6:23:07] Zelimeth: each kill u get like 1% buff or smth too, right, to incentivize the mini 1v1v1s etc
[6:23:10] hemsho: just wait in stealth until the end :D
[6:23:19] Rugmouse: Fortnite mode Pog
[6:24:33] Andenenez: Sorry, what are you talking about. Is this STV thing confirmed?
[6:24:54] jarlike: combine the tenacity and the bg buff from cata or panda
[6:25:00] perplexity: 122 raiders from perplexity have joined! 
[6:25:17] realityshift17: Pretty good idea
[6:25:28] jarlike: its a brilliant idea
[6:26:16] jarlike: keep the world pvp idea afeeling
[6:26:23] Drunk_Mantis: great idea, too good for blizz to implement KEKW
[6:26:33] vekz11: premades
[6:26:36] Frig0z: would be interesting to see which classes take it most often
[6:26:39] vekz11: will crush it
[6:26:46] varatupaj: i am not a fan of one life idea because it favour rat playstyle
[6:26:47] cyanne112: they said there isnt going to be like ashenvale so i expect some Koth / CotF gameplay
[6:26:56] Rugmouse: hard to see how a warrior would do okay in a mode like that after playing in this phase KEKW
[6:27:02] Drunk_Mantis: instanced STV zones doesn't seem too hard
[6:27:25] jarlike: Then it has to be layererd
[6:27:35] illuminareEU: That sounds sick tho tbh, id love to see something like that happen
[6:27:45] yaaksha: Not every class will be good in every type of content and that's okay
[6:28:10] jarlike: the Who is the best is details then
[6:28:13] jarlike: the idea
[6:28:17] Sinostra: 100 players might be too much tbh
[6:28:18] jarlike: is awesome
[6:28:49] Rugmouse: I'm just thinking about any class that lacks any sort of stealth/sustain though. Just as a talking point
[6:28:57] Zelimeth: will it be tarkov style too, u can enter with a gear set / risk of losing gear?
[6:29:05] Rugmouse: it's a cool concept
[6:29:07] Larr_y_: where did you get wewantblueshamans from ? i cant find it :(
[6:29:07] jujujay_myalias: imo it would still be cool if you could queue as a 5 man group. If you still spawn in separate locations the first goal of a group would be to fight their way to eachother (would still require individual skill)
[6:29:34] pecansedan: !weakaura
[6:29:44] jarlike: where is the sign up for this too be an actuall game implement
[6:29:44] yaaksha: I think that'd be sick, like Warriors dogshit 1vX mode but God tier 4vX
[6:29:59] Rugmouse: @yaaksha for sure!
[6:30:09] yaaksha: Levelling my Warrior is PAIN
[6:30:14] yaaksha: Level 22 now
[6:30:14] ashai84: !specc
[6:30:17] yaaksha: I need a boost

[6:33:37] contash1234: @Hydramist  u got guild ?
[6:33:49] jarlike: they should hire some old school players that enjoyed a big part of this game that disappeared
[6:34:04] contash1234: @Hydramist  leave them ye
[6:34:10] jarlike: 1v1 world pvp was so good

[7:31:50] LeanterN: What server did you roll for Aliance?
[7:31:57] Mystiggo: any1 fought any hunter pets after the nerf btw? are they weak now?
[7:32:31] luzid7: i mean hunter doing more dmg just pet got nerfed
[7:33:43] poptardxd: still op ez
[7:34:25] luzid7: yeah true it just don't feel op now but still good
[7:34:33] xhosas: still best healer coz other healers are shit, but will see for ph2
[7:35:30] xhosas: ye but other healers might be better healing runes, thats my biggest point
[7:35:50] xhosas: i dont think priest can get so many more op healing spells
[7:36:30] xhosas: lifebloom biggest issie is the cost
[7:37:20] Mystiggo: lifebloom can easily tip into OP because you get half the mana back on bloom
[7:37:29] Mystiggo: if bloom sustains you, you can just triple bloom, start regen and get half back later
[7:38:05] xhosas: i feel like pala will still be weakest healers
[7:38:24] xhosas: cant see how they can get something to make them better... HS baseline is just garbage
[7:38:43] Mystiggo: rememeber that paladins are running cloth and some leather atm
[7:38:55] Mystiggo: they'll probably add mail and plate with more healing this time around
[7:39:03] Mystiggo: palas could become quite tanky too
[7:39:10] xhosas: and they gona run cloth and leather for long time
[7:39:22] Mystiggo: we don't know that though
[7:39:28] Mystiggo: they could easily add plate healing gear to gnomeregan
[7:39:31] Mystiggo: they can do whatever they want rn
[7:39:40] xhosas: we actually know that
[7:39:48] xhosas: we dont know if they gona add plate to gnomeregan
[7:40:16] Mystiggo: yes, so we don't know
[7:40:25] Leoqal4: I levelled hunter and priest up to 25, but think I might take priest into the next phase first... altho i wanna level pala too
[7:40:40] xhosas: i played pala in classic and untill naxx i was full cloth mostly
[7:40:45] Mystiggo: Look at the loot tables in BFD. there's an insane amount of items
[7:40:49] Mystiggo: well itemized most of them
[7:40:52] Mystiggo: they will do the same for gnomer
[7:41:03] xhosas: easyest way to itemize would be tokens
