[3:12:51] MattyNiceTV: do you think that they are just going to go back through all the xpacs in classic or is there a stopping point?

[3:13:34] Jango_: cope
[3:13:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: That Blizzard survival game might be one thing I'm looking forward to hearing about most
[3:13:37] Anacydae: Ngl I love cata so I'd be hype
[3:13:42] BRUTALIT0PS: Cata is definitely the most underrated expansion imo
[3:13:48] robertb40: i been lvling on wath classic
[3:13:53] juga27: @wEiRdO_dUdE same!
[3:13:59] futomara01: unnerfed grim batol lets goo
[3:14:10] spookaninja_21: It still blows my mind that the reworked zones in Cata have been in retail longer than the vanilla zones
[3:14:10] Tuturs: its a solid exp
[3:14:12] Anacydae: @futomara01 Oh go
[3:14:54] j_bar111: missing talent point

[3:15:08] Molvonos: Two
[3:15:11] Tuturs: Uldum one
[3:15:14] dimofodi: I kind of miss the glyph system. I definitely miss the old reforging (changing some of one secondary stat to another)
[3:15:14] MattyNiceTV: Throne
[3:15:36] abracka_: technically four if you count baradin hold too
[3:15:40] spookaninja_21: Throne, Bastion and Blackwing 3 raids
[3:16:04] RocketLeagueProfessional: Joyous Journeys is up in Wrath rn right?
[3:16:11] StoneFaceWoW: you're getting me bricked up
[3:16:15] Tuturs: make a complete version of wod

[3:16:40] Jango_: that would be sick
[3:16:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they should add to Vanilla
[3:16:56] RocketLeagueProfessional: @abracka_ cool thank you
[3:17:07] HoboFighter2: Please no multiverse
[3:17:08] abracka_: are we finally getting dwarf mages in vanilla classic?
[3:17:17] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Imagine Shadowlands+, we get more Shadowlands content
[3:17:19] lodda85sn: servus
[3:17:26] nfernal_majesty: if they add new lore/content everyone would basically have to play it, those are some good ideas
[3:17:30] MattyNiceTV: time travel xpac to help the night elves in the war of the ancients
[3:17:36] futomara01: they should do all original vanilla plans that got canned
[3:17:37] Jango_: cata raiding was great
[3:17:38] BRUTALIT0PS: That would be amazing, I just don't know if they would commit so much effort to making a new expansion in a sense for Classic

[3:18:48] PotbellyGoat: we are up to 3 versions of Diablo
[3:18:48] Tuturs: still*
[3:18:52] NiteshadezTV: Its kinda silly. Splits the player base so much.
[3:19:09] Molvonos: @Tuturs Classic+ isn't classic anymore.  It's retail.

[3:21:22] nfernal_majesty: ohh ok gotcha
[3:22:11] dimofodi: That's what I'm saying. If they put it all in one executable, extremely unlikely we will end up running both at once. It's at least still a possibility if they're separate.

[4:08:20] zysmos: the only thing that matter for bass is to get an healthy amount of sub
[4:08:20] ItsNobbie: they also could setup the proper capitals in Draneor, which PvP-crazy Holinka ruined by moving them to Ashran
[4:08:24] TheGiant99: @rudric_ice it's really good
[4:08:25] DunzoCD: hows the mic that comes on it?

[4:14:50] feiqwan: Totk or bg3, I am leaning toward Zelda

[4:15:41] Quinstis: Hey! What addon do you use for your minimap @Towelliee
[4:15:44] Qelvue: is there any more games coming this year that could be a contender?

[4:15:59] Goddlin: No
[4:16:12] Syllvn: Mostly judges

[4:16:36] Goddlin: This chatter is high af
[4:16:37] Rudric_Ice: Kappa
[4:16:43] shaunathan83: Hope not
[4:16:47] Eraste: starfield wins best soundtrack imo
[4:16:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Diablo 4's launch was a ton of fun
[4:16:54] XshadowturkeyX: d4 story was very good thats the best paret of the game
[4:16:55] mavericks312: Also at this point with reviews an what not starfield might not even get nominated for goty
[4:17:15] Rudric_Ice: @XshadowturkeyX it was mid at best
[4:17:23] xziyn: As a Belgian, I hope they win, they certainly deserve it
[4:17:32] 3dRes: Gollum will win GOTY hands down
[4:17:35] snuffles_80: not a chance
[4:17:43] free2act: did zelda introduce anything groundbreaking? nope, did bg3? yup. So pretty easy decision to me
[4:17:51] Eraste: well obviously gollum wins we're just talking about 2nd place

[4:18:39] 91Niki: I meeeaaaan.... Is it fan voted? If so, Nintendo fanboys are... kpop level of voting cray cray
[4:18:40] Rudric_Ice: @Eraste ff16 wins that
[4:18:41] abracka_: the only thing totk has going for it is the cool game systems with building/fusing/etc
[4:18:44] Qelvue: the live-service category can have past games too though, don't think D4 will even be nominated for that category considering the established heavy-hitters in that category @Towelliee
[4:19:00] free2act: it's sad CP2077 dlc can't win that award xD
[4:19:01] Eraste: @Rudric_Ice oh, possible. havent heard ff16
[4:19:06] DunzoCD: the younger crowd will prolly vote zelda over bg3
[4:19:07] mavericks312: Or Zelda is just a better game
[4:19:09] captivate7: so many herbs
[4:19:22] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Quinstis (warning)
[4:19:38] snuffles_80: zelda sold 10 million copies first 3 days.. so yes it migt stand a chance
[4:19:41] devildriver1919: sea of stars might be up there as well
[4:19:44] Qelvue: probably no man's sky, they've been nominated every year I think :P
[4:19:47] 91Niki: @Quinstis Elvui
[4:19:54] mavericks312: I think that honky star rail actually wins live service goty
[4:20:03] TheGiant99: Phantom Liberty is gonna be so good
[4:20:04] Majhealth: Its polished... Thats what BG3 has. They didn't "release a beta game" as a released game. That was what early access was for. I think that its sad because other games will be better in the long run but they are "released betas" right now. @Towelliee
[4:20:28] 91Niki: I mean, sometimes indie. But Sea of Stars isn't on Hades level at all

[4:25:00] DunzoCD: I hope wild hearts wins something, i actually liked that game as a monster hunter clone
[4:25:01] GRVPHX: yea i figured u dont use headset mics lol figured i ask just incase tho.

[4:27:03] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 I've been playing it on my steam deck at night before bed :D plays amazing on the steam deck if you have one!
[4:27:40] TheGiant99: @91niki been thinking about getting one
[4:27:55] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 Think they are 20% off right now?
[4:28:37] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 yeah the steam decks are on sale atm!
[4:28:45] abracka_: @91Niki they're 100% worth getting honestly. i don't play mine that much, but it's such a great handheld. it doesn't get tiring holding it for a long session either
[4:28:46] buffn99: Open back headphones are way better
[4:29:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep Cyberpunk will be hot soon
[4:29:09] 3dRes: Neither have i LUL
[4:29:47] TheGiant99: @towelliee such a great game now

[4:30:15] 91Niki: @abracka_ Yep same! I play indie games on my steam deck mostly. But Gattz play No Man Sky on it and it runs amazing!
[4:30:28] TheGiant99: Starfield pushed me back to cyberpunk.
[4:30:33] Drew_Diligence: Loss leaders aren't that uncommon in tech these days, that's a big loss margin though
[4:30:40] Rudric_Ice: cyberpunk expansion comes out tomorrow
[4:30:44] buffn99: @Towelliee Sennheiser has really expensive open back headphones that theyre known for, but they also make cheaper ones for ~100
[4:30:53] abracka_: @91Niki i was honestly amazed how it handled D4 as well
[4:30:55] RolexKT: Same concept yea
[4:31:04] DunzoCD: i love my arctis 7 but they barely charge anymore so I might look into them

[4:42:34] falldrgn: is it confirmed we would get new xpac announcment at blizzonc?
[4:42:35] DunzoCD: they just want Jaina to come back
[4:42:36] mavericks312: From?
[4:42:40] ItsNobbie: Worldof Warcraft: Yarrr is the title
[4:42:50] MoodyVanessa: pirates are basically the tinkers of 11.0
[4:43:03] mavericks312: @falldrgn next xpac is next year already
[4:43:12] abracka_: owlbears or some shit idk
[4:43:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: You have to do moon dust or something, for the bear
[4:43:17] PvtHudson093: I want to go on an adventure to the Grand Line and be King of the Pirates
[4:43:18] Eraste: because they knew youd be an owbear in 10.2, 19 years later

[4:44:00] devildriver1919: cause its overcoming a hard enemy the courage it takes
[4:44:10] PvtHudson093: @mavericks312 Already read the mange but the LA was good
[4:44:14] spookaninja_21: Do we really need a new island/continent to explore? Just revamp some zones NOBODY goes to and incorporate them to the storyline
[4:44:16] RhadigarTV: Good morning @Towelliee and chat
[4:44:28] abracka_: i would rather see added specs for current classes, and possible new allied races for 11.0 over a new class/race
[4:44:29] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[4:44:33] MedicineMan: isn't Blizzard working on a survival game ?
[4:44:44] Rexialiton: @MedicineMan Yes
[4:44:46] mavericks312: @pvthudson093 I keep hearing the LA is good but dragon all evolution turned me off to all LA anime
[4:44:47] MoodyVanessa: @MedicineMan yes they are
[4:44:55] Skaibolg: Catch everyone off guard - announce a game shutdown notice followed by a Rick Roll.
[4:45:04] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 3 WoW announcements? So WoW f2p, WoW Console and WoW Back to China?
[4:45:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: everyone would just call them lazy to revamp a zone
[4:45:17] mavericks312: No one wants to level up or quest in in old content that shit is boring
[4:45:25] abracka_: @Milanesa_De_Pollo classic+, cata classic and wow xpac
[4:45:27] Aelissia: I'm all for updates yeah, but don't need the expansion story rooted there
[4:45:27] DunzoCD: thats why i wasnt a fan of cata
[4:45:36] spillek2505: I would love axactly that
[4:45:51] Rudric_Ice: i would love that but thats my opinion
[4:45:54] PvtHudson093: @mavericks312 Its better than most if not all LA adaptions, its a solid 7 for me
[4:45:57] mavericks312: No one wants to be 75 questing in the fucking barrens
[4:46:16] abracka_: i would legit screech with excitement if they drop classic+
[4:46:30] devildriver1919: am i losing my mind did they do the virtual ticket for ingame goodies yet?
[4:46:31] mavericks312: You want old zones go play classic
[4:46:36] artois: !dead
[4:46:36] Moobot: @artois HC Death #1: Typefour down: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1929566511
[4:46:49] Eraste: i do kinda miss retail, but have no one to roll with anymore
[4:47:03] Rudric_Ice: i mean if they actually do announce classic + ill nvr even come back to retail
[4:47:12] mavericks312: @eraste best part about retail is you don’t really need anyone to roll with
[4:47:17] Myndjestyr: im surprised blizz is cool with towelliee openly talking about knowing what's going on in advance
[4:47:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: It makes sense to try to accommodate as many players as possible
[4:47:27] spookaninja_21: But the “oh let’s go explore this secret land that has been cut off from the rest of the world for thousands of years” gets played out. With how much time has passed, the “old zones” could be completely new zones.
[4:47:36] Eraste: @mavericks312 you do for M+, at least for me. i dont pug. and i kinda miss M+
[4:47:47] DunzoCD: show me a secret dark iron empire that got corrupted by the old gods with nerubians or something
[4:47:51] Nokterian: R u a Leaker Kappa
[4:47:55] PvtHudson093: you as well be neon flashing lights
[4:48:00] Milanesa_De_Pollo: to be fair, Towelliee signed the NDA in English, so if he says anything in Spanish, he's good.
[4:48:01] iKorpen: yo I aint heard nuthin'
[4:48:03] Yagr6: @spookaninja_21 you have to understand only streamers and the top 1% players opinions matter
[4:48:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I didn't hear anything LUL
[4:48:04] spookaninja_21: Like let’s say the light invasion lands in felwood, completely changes the land until it’s no longer recognizable
[4:48:07] cesartcab: @spookaninja_21 they revamp them a lil every now and then
[4:48:10] digaboom: Honestly feels like we are due for like a panderia expansion where a new island / land just pops up out of no where lol
[4:48:11] Tebatusasula42069: damn lol
[4:48:15] Tebatusasula42069: you pulled way too much :p
[4:48:17] martianxl: Do you think thst classic cata will not have the sundering?  (That was paramount to the exp but was the reason so many disliked it.)
[4:48:18] spookaninja_21: The new planets idea would be a cool idea
[4:48:44] mavericks312: @yagr6 100% wrong the only ppl who wanna go back and quest an shit in old zones are candies
[4:48:46] patti221: elwyn forest portal
[4:48:47] Frenaris: I mean the old zones have gone through time, just like us, why can't they update all taht
[4:48:49] Frenaris: that*
[4:48:54] Eraste: @digaboom isnt that literally dragon isles?
[4:48:57] Rudric_Ice: no its like dwarf armor heritage quest
[4:49:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: We can think of Silithus and the sword (What sword?)
[4:49:07] PvtHudson093: So your saying its a whole underground expac
[4:49:09] Nokterian: yumytvJAMMER
[4:49:11] Grael1256: I mean, i guess they could do like a cata like event where old zones are redone - IF they wanted to go back to old zones instead of new
[4:49:12] Yagr6: @mavericks312 what am i wrong about?
[4:49:19] avarose8910: LUL LUL
[4:49:23] avarose8910: DinoDance DinoDance
[4:49:34] kokochris: I want another Dark Portal from our world to a new world, and both Horde and Alliance enter it to conquer and discover it
[4:49:37] mavericks312: Like oh boy lvl 75 hogger how fun
[4:49:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they dropped a sword in the zone and updated it, but there wasn't a good reason to stay there
[4:49:47] Eraste: we get alex to breathe on azeroth and turn it back into classic wow world Kappa
[4:50:01] snuffles_80: I want WoW 2 :)
[4:50:05] mavericks312: @yagr6 the majority of players don’t wanna go back and do new xpac stuff in old world zones
[4:50:07] Grael1256: nah.. barrens get fucked again lol
[4:50:12] DunzoCD: lol Sabellian becomes a new deathwing and destroys the land... again
[4:50:19] Frenaris: Nah they don't have to REDO the zones, why can't they just update them to be more current? You're telling me that throughout the years everything stays the same?
[4:50:23] abracka_: we're already on like wow 3.0 ppl need to stop with the wow 2 comments
[4:50:24] Dcarter: Good morning folks
[4:50:29] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 11.0 Iridikron is going forward in his mission to attract the Titans to Azeroth, so he goes to Outland. Get ready for Outland revamped! Kappa

[4:50:36] PvtHudson093: they un-Barrens The Barrens
[4:50:38] netnutz: well with the new cave system, they could for sure do an nerubian underground in Northrend
[4:51:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: HOTs and DOTs and then bear form
[4:51:09] mavericks312: @rudric_ice but that’s not the old world stuff ppl want, they want vanilla zones in new content and that shit would be boring
[4:51:14] DunzoCD: the most fun expansion personally would be to go way back in time pre-sundering
[4:51:16] Skaibolg: Azeroth needs a point of no return extinction event. Bring on a new world, Only Alliance/Horde get a similar treatment as to when the Horde originally arrived. Nobody is welcome.
[4:51:51] mavericks312: I hope Azeroth awakens and we’re forced to a new planet just to kill the oh we need to go back to vanilla zones
[4:51:53] kokochris: A new Dark Portal to a new world is an easy win imho.  new planet to explore, new lore to create, no need to tie it into much of the existing stuff
[4:52:12] wolfieke: they can make a climate change expansion where the ice in northrend melts and we discover all sort of secrets and caves lol
[4:52:13] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 thats a different way to introduce old revamped zones with new quests basically
[4:52:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reducing rage cost helps a lot

[4:53:17] Yagr6: @mavericks312 but when did i say they did
[4:53:17] mavericks312: Imagine the rage ppl will have if they actually destroy Azeroth lol
[4:53:18] DunzoCD: either that or Khadgar take us back to the beginning of Azeroth
[4:53:32] spillek2505: And then you can always come back in some crazy postapocalyptic expedition or sth
[4:53:57] spookaninja_21: Azeroth waking up destroys the planet right?
[4:54:06] Gunlove: that would be cool
[4:54:07] captivate7: yeah that would be really cool
[4:54:10] captivate7: the backstory to everything
[4:54:10] DunzoCD: thats what i was talking about
[4:54:11] kipduran: Sould have had the scourge overrun Azeroth when we came back thru the portal after WoD or from Shadowlands. Then we are forced to go thru a portal to a new worlds
[4:54:12] Yagr6: @mavericks312 all i said was the only opinions that matter are streamers and the top 1%
[4:54:14] patti221: that'd be cool
