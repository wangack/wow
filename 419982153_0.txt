[0:55:11] max_w92: @VanDAYUM if you have trouble understanding english thats that clear spoken you need to check your ears.... i can understand every single word
[0:55:19] xeropressure: The biggest issue right now with the MDI is a lack of racial and class diversity. Every team is basically the same. Night elves, then 1 of maybe 4 classes. It's bland not because M+ is boring, it's bland because every team is the same.
[0:55:19] Moobot: Mouse over the inspect tool on your screen to find out what gear and talent the teams are using. Tooltips powered by Wowhead!
[0:55:26] Shaembler: @gcscav you wanna give every class rop?

[0:55:47] bootymunchx: @xeropressure it was the same way with blood elves..
[0:55:55] Schrei205: the thing I dislike about arena is it's usually over if someone messes up and dies. m+ can be anyone's game up until the finish line. buuut I also don't really care about doing PvP in WoW so I'm not interested in watching it, so I don't come to the stream and complain when they're streaming PvP
[0:56:00] Shaembler: @thulyn123 yea true
[0:56:04] RagathDev: PvE is by far more challenging than PvP
[0:56:05] giadonna: @thulyn123 u prolly understand her english only because ur as bad as she is a person with proper english wont understand a word as I dont either !
[0:56:10] Schrei205: lol swear words are banned in the moderation settings, that's hilarious

[1:26:26] Krutsprut: outlaw takes no skill to play, prot warr 1 button build paired with avatar. When classes that easy gets strongest in game even the bad players tend to get their score up
[1:26:28] Fuzziew: @Kiotwo to say they are broke......maybe a little and the reason for that is because you have more top tier players showcasing their dmg and at this season in the game outlaw shines really well. Their ST is fair but I will agree that the aoe dmg can get a little silly. With that said ret pally some how flys under the radar on big aoe pulls. Yeah its every 2 mins for them but its impressive to say the least

[2:06:32] mallardbane: @realyosolo DH is good for pushing high keys because of defensives. outlaw does more damage and has more utility for speed runs on +19s
[2:06:34] The_LadyBlackstone: Thanks @Draedra . I went to put myself in queue for a Dungeon .I played my 1st Dungeon a few days back..I thought I was doing great and all of a sudden I got kicked out and sent back to which I came . Why did that happen?

[2:10:29] Vethosis: Pog
[2:10:33] McCape7: I wish they had a ban mode in here, so you could ban spec or class from your enemy. Would make knowledge of the dungeons and classes more valuable
[2:10:40] Morningst4R: @realyosolo with 2 rogues the tank can just kite forever and never lose aggro, and the rogues do the same aoe as dh

[2:12:31] Tox1cThoughts: Like prot warrior, monk havoc x2 and the druid
[2:12:41] Aislingyngaio: @vilestine so basically we shouldn't buy or sub to the game next expac until 9.2?
[2:12:45] NotGaldreyice: popped tranq?
[2:12:54] Tox1cThoughts: the healer could dps and make more dmg too LOL
[2:13:04] Morningst4R: @porcomentar yeah true, dh does benefit a fair bit from monk too, but less for sure
[2:13:17] McCape7: Im not telling anyone to sub or unsub, I like my time spent in wow. You do you.
[2:13:25] skullGGx: @realyosolo DHs doesnt have shroud dude
[2:13:25] dolby24j: bfa is a poor expansion until now
[2:13:53] Tox1cThoughts: hmmm touche
[2:13:57] Aislingyngaio: @vilestine gotcha, never pay money to blizz until at least x.2 of an expac
[2:14:09] Tox1cThoughts: like at least one havoc would be cool 2 see as i main havoc haha
[2:14:28] McCape7: @Aislingyngaio Looking at the history of the expansions and their patches, yes, that is good advice =D
[2:14:57] Tox1cThoughts: I miss marks hunter from legion :(
[2:14:58] dolby24j: pvp is the worst has been, story is trash, m+ is objectively worse than legion, classes are in poor place, no tiers, boring system
[2:14:59] EdoWillBePro: wow classic seasons server

[2:16:31] Mcfisters: @vilestine the monk is prioritizing single target while the prot warrior and rogues are all cleaving
[2:16:49] Plyticus: Imagine redesigning Fury going into BfA because it was too CD stacking heavy only to design prot warriors to do that very thing in 8.1 LUL
[2:17:08] McCape7: Ah I see thank you @Mcsqueet I always thought monk is good for cleave, fist of fury and everything =P

[2:17:13] voshmek: @vilestine I see you are new to BfA :D :D uninitiated ones often presume that dps are the ones who should deal dmg in such a game ;D
[2:17:14] Zijkrial: That tank should know that dying is....wong.
[2:17:17] Haselhoof: !Uptime
[2:17:23] skullGGx: they did that before 8.1
[2:17:23] Josho1: F
[2:17:24] kalonfest: LUL
[2:17:25] vladhealer: they never give Eudora here, is she too hard to kill in 19 tyra for MDI teams ? LUL
[2:17:29] Aislingyngaio: Something wong BibleThump
[2:17:29] Morningst4R: @vilestine prot warrior aoe is just broken with cds, that's why they're used here
[2:17:30] WildDevRay: easierst affixes on the easierst dungeon, how ppl die here?
[2:17:32] Azizinum: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:17:40] Kylatex: 4 death ? LUL bye
[2:17:41] kristi_92: 😂
[2:17:45] McCape7: Im not new to the game, I do admit I know nothing of +15 keys
[2:18:02] Goxich: nice Treacherous Covenant on a tank SeemsGood
[2:18:04] Zijkrial: How many of these groups are horde? I only ever seen nightelves.
[2:18:12] dolby24j: @morningst4r dungeons full of trash with several mecanics that need more meele than should, classes pruned makes a.couple a must to have, no grar change
[2:18:17] voshmek: @Morningst4R if it was only AoE that would be cool, but prot wars outdps other tanks on ST by about 50% margin also :D
[2:18:21] wisher12: something's wong, i can feel it... it's just a feeling i've got, like something's about to happen, and i don't know what
[2:18:28] Hefad: @Gnome64 they are always Nelf for the racial
[2:18:39] Samsonn411: why are always the same teamcomps in both teams?
[2:18:40] WildDevRay: @Gnome64 all of them are alliance
[2:18:43] McCape7: Night Elf has shadowmeld racial, that is somehow abused on these runs @Gnome64
[2:18:50] Morningst4R: @voshmek hmm I think prot pally does more ST dmg tbh
[2:19:07] Zijkrial: @hefad Yeah shadowmeld is op; was just curious if it was necessary for competition. Thanks @raymd @vilestine
[2:19:07] its_hekks: @Samsonn411 because they are the fastest best comps
[2:19:16] dolby24j: @morningst4r in the end i still have 2.7 *** as tank. *** are better
[2:19:17] Morningst4R: @dolby24j mechanics on trash is the only thing that makes it interesting, otherwise dps just mash their rotation and eat a sandwich
[2:19:21] Super_LSM: G I G A
[2:19:32] DillyG101: dont mess up danny
[2:19:37] Hefad: @Gnome64 for speed runs, is a must for now
[2:20:13] dolby24j: and i forget — lack of rewards
[2:20:22] WildDevRay: @hefad except for rogues ^^
[2:20:35] Ajifu: Pepega 📣
[2:20:35] Gebirges: Ahh! MDI in the middle of the night! I LOVE IT! <3
[2:20:35] Hefad: True
[2:20:37] Zijkrial: @hefad It makes me question the whole idea of mythics being speed-based, but maybe that's just me...
[2:20:39] McCape7: Okay abused is wrong word, they are doing the opposite actually. They are using the racial exactly how it is supposed to be used, which is opposite of abusing it
[2:21:19] TheDittu: I laugh every time someone calls shadowmeld OP, it hasn't been buffed. it's just that the actual OP racials have been nerfed like belf
[2:21:48] McCape7: Guys we have to remember that these guys are best of the best and are competing for money. They test every gem, enchant and spec and bring the absolute best so they win. This does not apply to us plebs at live servers
[2:21:51] TheMissingnomer: Outlaw BrokeBack
[2:21:51] kalonfest: Shadowmeld has been allready nerfed long time ago
[2:22:14] Moobot: More info about the MDI Program can be found at the WoW Esports website! https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/mythic
[2:22:22] tangentbords_krigaren: 100¤ they would nbe running Belfs if that racia lwasnt nerfed and changed instead of Nelfs
[2:22:25] Zijkrial: Not enough, apparently. I think it's boring to have only nightelves.
[2:22:34] TheDittu: these things were possible through the entirety of legion but nobody cried about it then
[2:22:35] Morningst4R: they buffed shadowmeld at some stage, wasn't it out of combat only in vanilla?
[2:22:42] McCape7: I dont want blizzard to change the game for everyone because 0.0001% of the playerbase (the pro players) are doing something questionable. This is game for us, not for them
[2:22:54] Xyronic: FeelsGladMan
[2:22:56] Zijkrial: I stopped watching OWL cause of the current match being 100% GOATS, and now I see all Nightelves. Blizzard NotLikeThis
[2:23:02] tangentbords_krigaren: No ithas always been able to be used in combat
[2:23:10] ayanamieu: @Morningst4R in tbc too
[2:23:22] ocdcarpentry: @vilestine game will die with that mentality, poe grows because they cater towards the top tier players not the casuals
[2:23:22] McCape7: @Gnome64 I have bad news for you if you planned to watch some hearthstone afterwards LUL
[2:23:23] Gebirges: Shadowmeld will be nerfed because of MDI - Warlocks will be nerfed because of CoS ...
[2:23:27] Morningst4R: the point of races is 99% visual preference, racials shouldn't be game changing imo
[2:23:28] AlunethMaster: this game is so dead..
[2:23:30] pursuee: not always actually
[2:23:35] taylorbeebz: heres the fix. *Cannot be used inside dungeons and raids*
[2:23:37] dudebro__: wtf am i watching
[2:23:49] Kylatex: They should put this type of events in Spanish too (deberian poner este tipo de eventos en español tambien )
[2:23:51] chaxinika: dont you guys get tired of complaining about every little thing?
[2:23:54] dudebro__: classic out yet?
[2:23:55] m4gnify: @Morningst4R yes @ shadowmeld
[2:23:58] Zijkrial: @vilestine haha, that's one game I never started watching. The warning is appreciated, though.
[2:23:58] chispurr: might as well nerf vanish then Kappa
[2:24:05] Malicone: Is this live?
[2:24:08] TheDittu: @Gnome64 SOME racial has to be the very best compared to the rest. and of course every single person racing in a tournament would pick that racial
[2:24:11] Evolutes: stahp hanks
[2:24:12] darkshinesp: LUL
[2:24:15] chispurr: yes
[2:24:16] Zorbrix: slootLUL slootLUL
[2:24:18] Ulquiiora: @TheDittu i wouldnt say shadowmeld is OP, its just the way it works with the current seasonal affix makes it really valuable, next season itll drop in value bu a huge amount unless u can bypass whatever the addix would be
[2:24:19] Draedra: Malicone yes
[2:24:20] AlunethMaster: no never
[2:24:21] tangentbords_krigaren: Lo
[2:24:26] McCape7: @OCD_Carpentry I see what you mean, interesting point

[2:24:31] Malicone: ok :)
[2:24:39] Gebirges: vilestine I enjoyed the HTC finals - so much fun watching :D
[2:24:54] Trenker: shadow smash lul
[2:24:57] lyndathetraveler: When did they start competitions?
[2:24:59] Kylatex: is Na Realm?
[2:25:07] Zijkrial: @TheDittu Well yeah, but shadowmeld seems FAR too much better than the rest. There's a difference between 'better' and 'the only choice'. This is only considering MDI, of course.
[2:25:12] Gebirges: Asia
[2:25:18] Zorbrix: Both of these teams are from China.
[2:25:21] wisher12: @lynda months ago
[2:25:29] TheDittu: @Gnome64 good job missing my point
[2:25:30] Zorbrix: There's also teams from Taiwan, Korea, and Australia in this division
[2:25:31] Zetherior: na math
[2:25:32] Kylatex: oh asia good ty bros
[2:25:37] ocdcarpentry: @vilestine its not so much that it isnt pleasurable to have content built around a casual audience, but wanting is more important than having in an mmorpg :)
[2:25:41] lyndathetraveler: No. like what time today. LOL
[2:25:47] TheMissingnomer: LULW
[2:25:47] Zijkrial: @TheDittu Good job not making a proper point.
[2:25:53] McCape7: @Gebirges Good :)
[2:25:56] DreamTheatern_n: Hamks
[2:25:58] Aislingyngaio: @Zorbrix how on earth did aussieland get lump into east cup
[2:25:59] Gebirges: You are a rogue! And you are a rogue! Everybody can meld! PogChamp
[2:26:00] TheDittu: @Gnome64 for MDI there will be no difference between "better" and "must pick", since EVERYONE will ALWAYS pick the best racial
[2:26:08] Gurthang117: shadowmeld is really good cause of reaping, and thats gona go next season
[2:26:09] wisher12: @lyndathetraveler lol, not sure
[2:26:18] tangentbords_krigaren: Hank need more SS's
[2:26:18] Belirs: Hankas farming those rep costs PogChamp
[2:26:18] izaya1994: its was fine to play arcane torrent for 2 years in legion but we got shadow meld for 3 months in reaping affix everyone starts complaining
[2:26:53] Zijkrial: @TheDittu You're only considering that due to how unique shadowmeld it, because that's absolutely not true otherwise.
[2:27:05] Zijkrial: is*
[2:27:16] Zorbrix: @Aislingyngaio Time Zones
[2:27:16] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel "AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Ted "Sloot" Bacinschi, Caroline "Naguura" Forer, Aaron "Sours" Shaffer, and Peyton "Tettles" Tettleton
[2:27:19] TheDittu: @Gnome64 mate everyone was blood elf in legion because it was the best
[2:27:27] Belirs: @Gurthang1337 shadow meld was also used in season 1 mdi for some skipping rooShrug
[2:27:30] Gebirges: man, tyrannical, bolstering, volcanic has to be the most annoying affix combo... no time for just being braindead
[2:27:32] Kylatex: for spanish people is so hard understan lol :( but we can try :) world of warcraft joins us all
[2:27:37] McCape7: @OCD_Carpentry Yes, I understand that. I would rather have something to look forward than having everything, because at that moment I don't "have" to play anymore, I "completed" the game. Always gotta have something to look forward. Good mentality.
[2:27:39] TheDittu: if any racial is the best, every person racing in a tournament will pick that racial
[2:27:48] TheDittu: it's not rocket science
[2:27:49] YesajaTV: fraggyOK
[2:28:01] shjandy: people are always going to complain about something that is never going to effect them exponentially because they don't compete professionally at this level. they'll just complain instead of enjoying what the game has to offer
[2:28:15] Flying5hitz: @TheDittu yea, but you could make every racial the best in a certain situation
[2:28:20] MaTaaRontwitch: zijn er hier mss echte spuitkutjes aanwezig?
[2:28:26] pppp5: oh wow look, monk druid warrior rogue rogue again Kappa
[2:28:27] Zijkrial: @TheDittu I'd be interested in seeing mythic runs in TBC dungeons, but I didn't have the same experience as you. WoTF, Warstomp, Stoneform...all were amazing in vanilla.
[2:28:34] Flying5hitz: the problem is shadowmeld is the best in VERY dungeon in EVERY comp

[3:13:26] mandahl: still good tho

[3:14:52] ZyneFIN: one rogue vanished
[3:14:54] Resonatex: gg BFC just better
[3:14:56] alltypos: Why do they never do Siege of Boralus or Temple of Sethraliss?
[3:15:16] unalign: Siege because diff pathing
[3:15:27] Hayo_oyaH: because siege is different for horde ally
[3:15:30] Mikedup: and its buggy
[3:15:32] wowshanksy: siege is banned due to different routes for horde vs alliance
[3:15:34] ArgusApostle: is there any other viable comp? Kappa
[3:15:37] Nightshadowh: 我是中国的朋友
[3:15:39] unalign: Temple because buggy snake head/orb eyes
[3:15:43] highvoltage988: @alltypos Siege is different for Horde and Alliance so it's not in the tournament. Temple was in the first few weeks but bugged out multiple times in the Eye room
[3:15:47] fantom2k40: @alltypos there were temples
[3:16:03] Candyfriend: Temple cos they discovered a new bug that hasnt been reported since beta :^)
[3:16:05] alltypos: Thanks all!
[3:16:28] sweetdemise123: i miss 70 deaths seat :(
[3:16:29] Anyria_: What bug? :o
[3:16:32] doppelgangaaa: why is skittish even a tournament affix in this meta
[3:16:34] Hayo_oyaH: @ArgusApostle yeah, frost mage was taken by 2 eastern teams
[3:16:46] Hayo_oyaH: *wester
[3:17:05] catrob0t: can't they just only do horde vs horde and ally vs ally for siege?
[3:17:09] Azizinum: teeming/volcanic? is this ajoke
[3:17:11] Zahnster: Kween!
[3:17:13] Candyfriend: @eruthedreamer chance for the eye gauntlet to despawn and never come back therefore unable to complete key
[3:17:18] catrob0t: why ban it completely
[3:17:33] Resonatex: @Azizinum skittish volc
[3:17:40] Anyria_: Oh, thanks!
[3:17:41] hiroshig6923: mainly cuz its their tourney and they can decide w/e they want
[3:17:46] Resonatex: basically not even affixs
[3:17:47] moonhaze1: So, every single vid I've watched is exactly the same line up. Warrior Tank, Resto Druid, 2 Rogues and a WW Monk …. does this not highlight the rest of the classes need some love? + (drunken estimate) 95% horde … isn't there 2 factions still?
[3:17:54] Hayo_oyaH: @0rdalia because they can't force players to go horde or ally
[3:17:58] sweetdemise123: @0rdalia of course not that would require common sense. not something encouraged at blizz HQ
[3:18:03] Azizinum: @nateohh25 lol even easier affix
[3:18:08] fantom2k40: @0rdalia it is on teams to chose faction I suppose
[3:18:18] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel "AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Ted "Sloot" Bacinschi, Caroline "Naguura" Forer, Aaron "Sours" Shaffer, and Peyton "Tettles" Tettleton
[3:18:19] Hayo_oyaH: ^
[3:18:23] Mikedup: in m+ alliance rules
[3:18:25] Resonatex: yeah as i said cant get these in live for months on end
[3:18:34] BPVend: full screen
[3:18:35] Candyfriend: 0 affixes. yet still wipes 4Head
[3:18:47] Resonatex: @Candyfriend heyo
[3:18:50] hiroshig6923: well techincally if everyone is going horde or everyone is going ally they can make it that all people choose same faction so everyone is on same terms
[3:18:53] Resonatex: yeah 0 affixs feelsbad
[3:18:57] Rogash95: just to have that mentioned tho, if you look on live most of the high keys are done by horde tho ^^
[3:19:10] Candyfriend: warlerHEY @nateohh25

[3:19:45] dgraveline: Naguura Kreygasm
[3:20:00] fantom2k40: @hiroshig6923 like it is not enough meta that there's no horde anyway - lets force people to play one faction
[3:20:00] Candyfriend: warlerPOG the crew is all here
[3:20:16] Frankkie91: "They're probably watching the stream"???? WHAT?
[3:20:20] travske: this isnt even the real skittish try doing skittish with 3 ret pallies
[3:20:23] ivrae11: always the same comps with every team.. This is so boring to watch.
[3:20:26] Resonatex: warlerD1 warlerD2
[3:20:28] paltai: warlerTURBIE
[3:20:37] hiroshig6923: well if everyone is one faction than everyone is playing on same terms which makes it fair
[3:20:40] Hayo_oyaH: people to tend to go where they will find people who play at the same level as they do, once the trend started for high level people to play horde, it snowballed from there
[3:20:42] travske: warlerD1 warlerD2
[3:20:43] Candyfriend: warlerTURBIE
[3:20:50] Mikedup: I play a rogue so im happy XD

[3:21:00] pinnacle1: Double outlaw PogChamp Prot war PogChamp resto druid PogChamp so brave, yet so bold PogChamp
[3:21:01] Resonatex: Yeah with rogues they dont even care about skittish :/
[3:21:06] Moapie: make them try hard the entire way through
[3:21:17] paltai: warlerHEY
[3:21:20] Naowh: show the strats 😡
[3:21:22] DrBeer134: LOVE THESE UDDER TEAMS
[3:21:25] anothefat: why is this double rogue monk combo is good?
[3:21:34] travske: a good old bamboozle
[3:21:35] Azizinum: why black mamba slow af ?!
[3:21:36] Klaypetzki: They do know where they are
[3:21:40] catrob0t: @Moapie since when do they know? I remember they didn't used to
[3:21:51] naxxius: @Naowh dont you have more 26s to be doing
[3:21:51] Klaypetzki: Most teams will have a spy watching the stream
[3:21:53] naxxius: owait shrine
[3:21:55] hiroshig6923: they can tell all contestants to go to one faction to do a certain dungeon which is okay since its thrier tourney and they make the rules and cut the checks
[3:21:56] naxxius: :)
[3:22:02] kapalesya: Dang what time is it in Asia
[3:22:03] gunnar50o1: they are allowed to pull up the stream
[3:22:07] Kylatex: @Naowh u are the best boy!!!
[3:22:08] travske: maybe rokmora jumped into the fray and bricked the chinese keys???
[3:22:14] Moapie: @0rdalia announcers just said they know
[3:22:16] pollyrhythm: @naowh came here to learn how to play?
[3:22:28] Dorky1495: ughhh why did black mamba have to do a back to back?
[3:22:29] naxxius: yikes
[3:22:31] Resonatex: warlerYIKES
[3:22:40] Mikedup: @hiroshig6923 how is that any different then to whats already happening?
[3:22:53] travske: some people say china is still fighting rokmora to this day
[3:22:57] prominence_: bcz outlaw rogue is broken right now, monk dmg is okay and monk gives boost to rogues
[3:23:12] Moapie: @0rdalia which is why i think they shouldn't be allowed to know, until the end, it's a race and they have to perform as best they can, regardless of the opponents position, hence blind races are best

[3:23:49] Hayo_oyaH: @Darkytotem1295 why does that matter? they're fresh
[3:23:52] hiroshig6923: okay so if they want you to run a certain dungeon but you have to be a certain faction to run it... they can tell all contestants to play that faction so they can stream that dungeon
[3:23:55] Klaypetzki: then why have the head to head matches
[3:24:02] catrob0t: your chat is dead @DrDion
[3:24:04] travske: @DrDion ill fight u mate
[3:24:07] Klaypetzki: time trials would be the only important part
[3:24:07] habsare24: is jack being played by the castor automaticjack?
[3:24:10] Rogash95: well a race like this beeing a Bo3 duel (sort of) makes it actually more interesting if they see each other
[3:24:35] Hayo_oyaH: he's playing druid which is technically a caster
[3:24:38] stupefacio: DrDion please dont say Dead its offensive to dead people
[3:24:40] Mikedup: or just not run that dungeon and have less hassle
[3:24:40] Dorky1495: @bishop_gilchrist Why wouldnt it matter? BFC hadn't played a match yet, facing a team who just played a first round of 3 dungeons
[3:24:44] Rogash95: there is a chance for UH-DKs to appear tho
[3:25:01] gunnar50o1: @Moapie there would be no point in the 1v1 dungeons if you did that you might as well not stream it and just show a list of each groups times in the dungeons
[3:25:21] Hayo_oyaH: are you saying it gives one team an advantage?
[3:26:01] travske: i wish ginomvp was here he would spice up the mdi with his godly power
[3:26:11] Dorky1495: im asking why they had to play two matches back to back, nothing less nothing more, there is another match as well with both teams that had not played the previous match
