[0:10:52] ezprit07: Do you recommend disc or rsham ?
[0:10:56] Zumaji: I'm like hardstuck 2-2.1k on ww right now, lobbies are brutal. can't catch anything just perma walking
[0:11:07] asim96: rdruid, why bother with disc or rsham lol
[0:11:31] Axtin: hpal very underrated imo
[0:11:33] ATHLTE: hpal feels good too
[0:11:34] NJMcChillan: i think druid trees are definitely too strong but other healers are good
[0:11:37] NJMcChillan: hpal good for shuffle for sure
[0:11:42] ItsRoxasXD: good morning everyone
[0:11:44] asim96: 61% at 2.4k+ in 2s, 40% at 2.4k+ in 3s...

[0:11:47] ATHLTE: even in 3s imo
[0:11:51] Gotheels: hpal in melee cleave lobbies are bis
[0:11:54] Lleo00: GM gamers
[0:11:56] flames222: the issue is that other healers can't compete vs rdruid and can really only compete amongst each other
[0:12:03] rekt1370: every rank 1 team i watched just run down the holy pally
[0:12:41] taruninja88: off all the healers you tried which one do u like most? XD

[0:30:19] kurtsdk: @rekt1370 you could tell that one at least was def just somebody waiting and had a fast kick, not kickbot fast
[0:30:21] heymomimonttv: @doubledeadly69 might need a new battery for colder weather

[0:32:32] wackpoetic: Peachxp_ you're saying you just press kick as soon as he stops moving even though you know he's playing Precog???
[0:32:37] Nitsud97: kick was faster then cast lol

[0:33:11] kreyzy8: it looks like hes just trying to prekick when you stop moving tbh
[0:33:13] itsyaboi_chuck: nice sunny day in colorado can't complain
[0:33:21] kurtsdk: seems like his xp would check out for just being a fast kicker, multi glads / rank one
[0:33:24] Bwrecker: anyway thx again ven
[0:33:27] thepk85: @venruki did you actually report him?
[0:33:41] dre_day_3k: I don't know about most people, but when I am accused of something I know I haven't done I don't give it any thought or try convince anyone otherwise
[0:33:45] JmanOwnz: tbh i wouldn't say that for sure looks like botting to me. But can see why it's sus from your perspective.

[0:39:24] ItsRoxasXD: The PeachBots took me out
[0:39:46] crymorre: @dre_day_3k exactly. blizzard bans 300k botters every month so if someone is botting they will get banned quickly. i've never seen a botter survive a ban wave ever in my entire time playing the game. it's more efficient than germ-x 99.9% kill rate

[0:51:43] absterge: it will be OP af
[0:51:49] dropbombsss: I randomly started playing retail again 2 days ago and made a pres and its super fun
[0:51:49] ATHLTE: ya it does insane hps
[0:51:52] Ambersulfr: rdruid is making a lot of stuff look worse than it is
[0:51:53] ATHLTE: already
[0:51:59] dickman911: pres evoker is my favorite healer, yet its so fucking hard in shuffle
[0:52:03] absterge: he’s always like that
[0:52:05] absterge: 😂😂
[0:52:10] wackpoetic: There's a mismatch between the Patch Notes and PTR
[0:52:14] DirtyYankee0: cdew is a psyop enjoyer
[0:52:16] Chopper_T: hpal needs some love
[0:52:16] Peachxp_: its 20% flat healing if ur good with hot uptime and then its also just gonna get so many extra free disenerates
[0:52:17] Lleo00: the range thing is pretty bad for pres can put ppl in a lot of shit positions
[0:52:19] ATHLTE: just in time for awc LUL
[0:52:22] whspe: as long as those npc treants stay in the game they’ll be op af
[0:52:26] Lleo00: theyre hyper mobile tho soi guess that can make up for it
[0:52:32] fusionguy100: i thought it was 40%
[0:52:34] ATHLTE: sub boomy dragon?
[0:52:45] boundric: hpal got a nerf by changing the spell school of divine tool. so now if you're kick you can't cast tool anymore
[0:52:52] aragarde: isn't that what yall say about all healers
[0:52:55] skez_live: I have to try pres again
[0:52:58] absterge: hpal is also solid druid is just god tier
[0:52:59] skez_live: i had 1 arena and quit hah
[0:53:04] aragarde: is there actually a healer in a bad position
[0:53:05] DeityRevert: 10%
[0:53:06] Gotheels: pres will still be hard in caster lobbies regardless of how much healing they get
[0:53:09] Aceliyia: @Chopper_T HPal is really good right now. Are you running the right talents? What're you struggling into?
[0:53:13] zachgamegodx: what kind of love does holy paladin need? it's the top healer in shuffle and good in 3's
[0:53:15] zachgamegodx: hi ven
[0:53:22] Breadmanfun: as a not high rated player all healing specs feel fine to me!
[0:53:27] crymorre: won't sub eat pres evokers alive and become even more annoying, at least rdruid can hot and bear
[0:53:31] Taevenx: This playlist is rad AF peepoClap
[0:53:39] zendur0: what dps specs is consider S tier
[0:53:41] Salanzo: why hasnt my 35min sholo shuff que popped yet pepesadge
[0:53:44] ItsBees: I'm so tired of triple melee groups in SS Sadge
[0:53:47] zachgamegodx: fistweaver is getting some pretty seriouiis survival buffs
[0:53:56] zachgamegodx: you know when you use your yu'lon everyone gets a shield ven?
[0:54:01] DirtyYankee0: im sorry for my participation in that @ItsBees
[0:54:02] ImJordanHi: Mehh seems to believe in evoker quite a bit, and the style. He basically only plays it - seems to work for their team
[0:54:06] Sosatko: the "but we sdie in stuns" meme
[0:54:09] Sosatko: so does every1 lma0o
[0:54:09] aragarde: does a sub rogue die to a subrogue lol
[0:54:10] zachgamegodx: now if you press thunder focus tea and then expel harm, you get that same shield
[0:54:10] ItsBees: @DirtyYankee0 you should be Sadge
[0:54:11] Ambersulfr: speaking of dying, a lot more squishies are going to be dying if rdruid gets nerfed Kappa
[0:54:16] zachgamegodx: in 10.2.5
[0:54:17] Ambersulfr: so the dps meta will probably shift lol
[0:54:26] crymorre: ya i'm not saying pres is bad i'm thinking sub will be even more annoying if ppl swap off druid
[0:54:31] SanukiTV: easy solution: fix dance. only 1 charge every 90 seconds or so.
[0:54:33] NJMcChillan: does the echoing reprimand change mean clothies are gonna get one tapped even harder
[0:54:33] DeityRevert: DH getting buffed with changes too. hunt and decree getting like 15% cause it's base chaos now
[0:54:33] crymorre: so ppl will just be more angy haha
[0:54:40] DirtyYankee0: wrong @DeityRevert
[0:54:42] Raskopp: wait DH is gonna be insane with his shadowlands spells becoming chaos dammage isn't he ?
[0:54:54] zachgamegodx: @NJMcChillan echoing reprimmand itslef is not a burst attack
[0:54:55] ALLtheEXP: not really
[0:54:56] zachgamegodx: it's a set up global
[0:55:03] DeityRevert: @DirtyYankee0 nope. they are only getting a part of their mastery added to it atmo. will be full mastery soon
[0:55:08] aragarde: pretty sure any means necessary converts to mastery
[0:55:10] Ambersulfr: I don't think the dh change does anything unless they make eyebeam kickable again
[0:55:10] zachgamegodx: and i dont think any of the rogue specs use reprimmand
[0:55:13] DirtyYankee0: @DeityRevert The hunt damage is already chaos before change because of the talent
[0:55:27] zachgamegodx: DH thing means nothing, it's an aesthetic buff/nerf depending on your preference
[0:55:34] DeityRevert: @DirtyYankee0 that's only because of the bottom talent, and if you checked, it's only a precentage of mastery, not full thing
[0:55:38] DeityRevert: go check
[0:55:45] DirtyYankee0: I have already checked
[0:55:49] zachgamegodx: @DeityRevert no its all your mastery
[0:55:51] Raskopp: ohh yeah forgot that about DH dammage
[0:55:53] zachgamegodx: the % you see, is YOUR mastery
[0:56:03] zachgamegodx: come on lads
[0:56:08] Time_Limits: I might probably need more vers on my death knight idk. Im like 24% vers with high mastery. I take so much damage sometimes it is hard to play x.x
[0:56:17] DeityRevert: wrong. my master is curerntly 74% but the talent that changes it is 59%
[0:56:23] taistelija23: !addons
[0:56:24] Moobot: @taistelija23 Details, SArena, Omnibar, OmniCD, Big Debuffs, Weak Auras, RaiderIO addon
[0:56:25] aragarde: some people just don't read patch notes or have a sense of context clues
[0:56:41] Time_Limits: what do u think @venruki
[0:56:42] aragarde: although blizz has been known to make confusing wording in their spells too
[0:56:44] DeityRevert: the talent only gives you part of your mastery added, not full thing
[0:56:53] skez_live: have you tried fistweaving much ven?
[0:57:02] boltqt_: LMAO
[0:57:06] Time_Limits: LOL XD
[0:57:09] ItsBees: I have 43 on my boomy and just fall over to melee Sadge
[0:57:09] Time_Limits: based
[0:57:11] michxxlh: how is he typing and in a ss
[0:57:14] Ambersulfr: definitely based
[0:57:16] nikthevoker: youre missing 10% verse LUL
[0:57:31] aaggros: Doesnt verse dr after 30%?
[0:57:41] IIyena: only like 20% dr
[0:57:43] boltqt_: Is it normal to get same healer back to back lobbies?
[0:57:45] iloveyalunn: If your versa is that low you better be top DPS by a long shot
[0:57:49] DirtyYankee0: he did say that KEKW
[0:57:54] Time_Limits: yeah I heard that why I comment haha XD
[0:58:05] Time_Limits: i will get more vers
[0:58:10] bransby09: partywaffles says 24-30 is minimum
[0:58:12] Time_Limits: damn
[0:58:14] Salanzo: isnt 10% vers only 5% DR or does it add more from other sources
[0:58:19] Time_Limits: @bransby09 ^
[0:58:19] ayosteviey: Yo how do u get those extra casts bars on your ui? Like in the bottom right
[0:58:32] Time_Limits: I guess low vers only work if u are not the target iddShrug
[0:58:51] crymorre: @ayosteviey those are actually from the blizzard default arena frames i think, you can see the frames hiding over in the corner lol
[0:58:53] Celestiahz: @ayosteviey those are the blizzard default arena frames
[0:58:56] heymomimonttv: @Time_Limits u also need vers for dmg in pvp
[0:59:12] ayosteviey: But can you dupilicate them so you have multiple in different spots?
[0:59:23] heymomimonttv: @ayosteviey no
[0:59:30] ayosteviey: brutal ty
[0:59:35] crymorre: @ayosteviey nah, you can prob do some stuff with addons but he's not doing anything for it
[0:59:37] 1skyque: classic
[0:59:40] taistelija23: or did you range him Kapp
[0:59:42] boundric: that DK was baited so hard
[0:59:43] ATHLTE: the shuff experience
[0:59:51] yimoxq: that DK ran straight into the afterlife
[0:59:53] skez_live: Cant heal em all
[0:59:54] ALLtheEXP: Snipe shot IS bad. Particularly when you get to higher mmrs where its easy to stop
[1:00:00] Time_Limits: @heymomimonttv yeah that is true. I keep hearing that u dont need to have super high vers cuz it will have a DR effect
[1:00:08] taistelija23: @ALLtheEXP how do you stop it
[1:00:21] boundric: DR for stats doesn't kick in until 30%
[1:00:22] dre_day_3k: Hopw long is that cast why is no one lining it lol
[1:00:23] ALLtheEXP: @taistelija23 Stuns or line of sight
[1:00:24] heymomimonttv: @Time_Limits after 30% you can stop stacking vers
[1:00:28] crymorre: @taistelija23 line it, micro cc it, disarm it
[1:00:30] ALLtheEXP: knock backs, etc
[1:00:34] taistelija23: ty
[1:00:40] GnRHDota2: ams icebound on the saame global
[1:00:45] GnRHDota2: what is this dk doing xd
[1:01:02] ALLtheEXP: @taistelija23 It's just such a long cast time that its esaier for more aware players (higher mmr) to stop it then you wasted like 2-3 global windows to do nothing.
[1:01:11] taistelija23: good points lads
[1:01:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[1:01:31] squamch: God tier music taste
[1:01:33] michxxlh: idk why both monk knocks dont dr with each other
[1:01:33] ALLtheEXP: Only real good way to use it is from stealth in opener lol but then you're still giving up some decent honor talents just to take sniper shot
[1:01:59] boba_svenjamin: playing wihtout statue hardmode?
[1:02:02] boundric: clean
[1:02:17] Time_Limits: @heymomimonttv I dont have enough conquest for conquest chest but I do got a vers/master crafted  chest. I might need to remove my crafted ring to give me more vers or maybe change the haste/mastery crafted ring to vers/mastery?
[1:02:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Put an air horn on the statue one!
[1:02:41] boundric: i don't know if it helps but you could also apply the monk debuff that increases damage they take

[1:05:08] Jplague21: I think it's hilarious when people say the game is too easy now. The game is currently far more complex now than it was in the old days
[1:05:38] okok28: Do you want the weak aura to remember to pee?

[1:09:00] Lleo00: brutal
[1:09:01] Time_Limits: that is sadness
[1:09:03] yimoxq: why do healers gain so much less? Susge
[1:09:03] NJMcChillan: feels bad

[1:09:10] Peachxp_: only 41 mmr gained too pretty wild
[1:09:13] ItsBees: Love getting the healing bonus after someone leaves 3 rounds in LUL

[1:10:51] NJMcChillan: i wouldnt say i LOVE shuffle but i do like being able to play the game
[1:11:00] taistelija23: @GI_Jake_ its being tested atm. The battleground blitz brawl is basically a test suite for soloque rbg
[1:11:05] ItsBees: melee just needs most of their CC removed and shuffle will be fun
[1:11:06] enji_1: the instant healer queue is the crutch for me

[1:34:40] zachgamegodx: if u fell into th e ground, you'd be like obi'wan and use the force to get all the rocks off u and kill vader
[1:34:42] Abruty: And remove all those pets/totems making it unplayable
[1:34:46] leeka: rogues are in the wrong expansion
[1:34:47] donut_s: when has rogue been bad?
[1:34:54] 3KuLTV: @venruki whats your playlist?
[1:34:56] Borngood: @absterge KEKW
[1:34:57] Magottx: Don’t call me that
[1:35:12] dobidley: this is a little morbid, but since you said play untill you are in the ground....can we say "and down goes Venruki" at your funeral?
[1:35:15] nightmxz: 100% haste buff
[1:35:18] Magottx: It’s an alt ok
[1:35:20] absterge: ye .2 sec clones
[1:35:24] absterge: LUL
[1:35:31] jporter_: where did glizzy get that title
[1:35:33] Axtin: it worked on rez too
[1:35:33] nightmxz: and they had genesis back then too so you'd legit lay on hands with a rejuv up
[1:35:37] whspe: just kick it
[1:35:42] Borngood: I def remember, had some1 rez with it in 5s
[1:35:43] ImJordanHi: Did they make any changes today? Sid was saying if they dont today he doesnt think they will?
[1:35:45] SteLawBro: Rogues a million percent broken under optimal conditions. Youre average rogue though...Gonna get slapped around LuL
[1:35:45] Borngood: I Was mad
[1:35:50] figurines: you should sell shirts that have an ice block on the front and say "venruki" on the back.
[1:36:14] kand1nsky: kavlish made everyone hate rogues :(
[1:36:21] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy lunaris2389 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:36:27] jporter_: i think everyone just hates rogue
[1:36:28] ItsBees: rogues made everyone hate rogues
[1:36:30] iloveyalunn: No... Rogues made everyone hate rogues
[1:36:34] DirtyYankee0: rogues did it
[1:36:34] Axtin: theres actually rogues that say "idk if we didnt have this talent we would fall over in the current meta"
[1:36:43] Axtin: xd
[1:36:48] whspe: cough, nahj
[1:36:49] nightmxz: I much prefer how kalvish and pika play rogue to how a lot of other rogues play
[1:36:52] ChunliWW: what talent we talking about
[1:36:54] rekt1370: vsing sub is just so aids they do goes one person after another and you have 20 seconds orl ess to play or you lose
[1:36:54] Borngood: @Axtin rogues would be awful without 20 sec divine shield
[1:37:01] Axtin: @ChunliWW cloak bop
[1:37:02] Palumor: Rogues r kinda weak rn :/ feel bad for all my rogue homies
[1:37:03] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @Axtin Does the name rhyme with rahj
[1:37:07] ChunliWW: lmao
[1:37:12] ChunliWW: DURRR
[1:37:24] Axtin: LOL
[1:37:37] Axtin: trinket cloaking this infernal stun here
[1:37:40] Axtin: why not
[1:37:58] dre_day_3k: 2024 and still crying about rogues is nuts. Every expac its the same Kek
[1:37:59] whspe: 1 shotting here
[1:38:06] dickman911: CDR is my biggest complaint about rogues
[1:38:07] foxyllama: Rogues legit play so awful n careless
[1:38:12] ChunliWW: with how liberally they use it you can argue they dont need it at all
[1:38:13] foxyllama: They ruin the game
[1:38:25] iloveyalunn: "Im getting a re, im getting a re, im getting a re..."
[1:38:27] Peachxp_: Do you like the bracers on pres? i saw cdew praises them but idk they proc off crit heals and he plays perma with a boomkin with moonkin aura so im conflicted
[1:38:31] Phorians: @venruki Did I ever tell you about that hike I did some months ago when I took a chopper ride to wilderness and hiked back? Was pretty unique experience
[1:38:50] Phorians: Shiit
[1:39:22] Palumor: Wow is boring without Rogues cmon guys
[1:39:29] Palumor: u guys need us to have something to complain about
[1:39:32] rekt1370: who doesn't love a good duel at the end of being stunned for 10 mins
[1:39:40] kand1nsky: rogues should be delete
[1:39:41] DirtyYankee0: KEKW @rekt1370
[1:39:56] foxyllama: Have u seen a rogue main alt before LUL
[1:39:58] Phreshbrew: @Palumor wow players will always have something to complain about :)
[1:40:07] DirtyYankee0: rogue mains alt KEKW
[1:40:07] jporter_: i cant believe duel is still in the game
[1:40:08] Icetomeetyu: sub rogue is actually super hard to climb on, ppl can't survive longer than 1,2 setups on lower raitings
[1:40:29] Axtin: outlaw is equally as disgusting as sub
[1:40:47] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @Axtin Just wait til you see aoe assa :P
[1:40:55] rekt1370: yea thats the best part they nerf sub and then they all go outlaw
[1:40:55] taistelija23: @Axtin so hard to paly
[1:40:57] taistelija23: play
[1:40:57] joyrex_j9: I mean all of this shit is because they reworked the rogue base tree, right?
[1:41:07] ashmedai127: @Axtin As they should be. We are an island of Law and Order!!!!
[1:41:08] rekt1370: yea pretty much
[1:41:16] isseswagger: catJAM
[1:41:20] rekt1370: it was downhill after they gave rogues melee cloak
[1:41:24] joyrex_j9: every time anything is reworked its busted
[1:41:34] nightmxz: damage should be more permanent
[1:41:44] nightmxz: less bursty and more permanent feels way better
[1:41:48] isseswagger: yes
[1:41:57] Axtin: so back to only sub having dance
[1:42:01] Axtin: go*
[1:42:02] DirtyYankee0: I like half that take
[1:42:07] b_lappy: ^
[1:42:10] DirtyYankee0: assa is the only fair version of rogue is true
[1:42:43] IWCarry: @nightmxz sustain dmg is super high rn and so is burst
[1:43:03] mrmsix6: Delete the rogue class. Getting rid of the class would be nice, but the real gift would be getting rid of rogue players.
[1:43:09] nikthevoker: when you were talking about the glizzy, was hoping fo devoker games LUL
[1:43:38] panasiuk97: healing = fun
[1:43:43] boundric: this is a lock nightmare
[1:43:47] rekt1370: this poor lock LUL
[1:43:49] Tyler1206: hello
[1:43:53] ashmedai127: @mrmsix6 delete rogues, rename demonhunter. Clearly warglaives are close enough to two daggers, who will notice?
[1:43:56] ChilledsDogTreats: to go for a heavy healing communion, you need your verdant embrace buff on them
[1:43:59] dre_day_3k: was he in arena gear and not the mix wpvp stuff?
[1:44:03] dipicat: @mrmsix6 rogue can be fun to verse they just need to be balanced without the insane bias that blizz clearly has for them :)
[1:44:04] rekt1370: there is nothing fun about playing lock in this lobby LUL
[1:44:06] Magottx: I went 1-5  2 lobbies in a row before I realized my gear was busted…
[1:44:14] panasiuk97: i want a nobody dies game
[1:44:36] deanoxs: when healing is easy you are not at your rating, as soon as you have players at your lvl its always tough imo
[1:44:36] ItsBees: they added to much pve stuff into pvp, these immunities/heals make sense when you're questing and whatnot but not in pvp
[1:44:42] absterge: you should carve that into a statue
[1:44:46] joyrex_j9: nobody dies, then the healers just shake hands at the end and get ratings while the dps get 0 for 3/3
[1:45:07] backstreetalright: draw so everyone feels neutral
[1:45:14] davErosEe: the only time I take a long break from wow is when it’s damp most games.
[1:45:34] biofreaks: KEEP ROLLING
[1:46:18] dipicat: @venruki have you listened to sleep token? i feel like you'd love em
[1:46:40] bugTV: more like ResidentSleeper token
[1:47:01] nightmxz: With warbands you won't have to do that anymore CoolCat
[1:47:06] boundric: probably a software limitation
[1:47:25] joyrex_j9: why put points into a tree where you get all of the things in the tree
[1:47:45] absterge: I hope next xpac they fix all the maps that don't work in shuff. I'd love to play on ashamane's
[1:48:16] biofreaks: 40% res?
[1:48:19] rekt1370: this dk doing zero damage every round

[1:55:48] hipsterdufus: I have 1500 shuffle games, still dont have that title, it's totally bugged
[1:55:53] lol_solace: how do u play as a frost mage when ur out of shimmers? just stand there faking n damaging? or kite
[1:55:54] senteriaa: do you mend a lot of battles?
[1:55:58] Omnadren: yes!
[1:56:02] SweatyDaniels: are there any good Youtube guides for healing shuffle
[1:56:15] nightmxz: Does anyone know why you can only have 1 dracthyr per realm? Kinda silly imo
[1:56:25] Magottx: Yea that’s what I play and went insta 2.2
[1:56:26] nightmxz: I wanna play dev on 1 and pres on the other
[1:56:30] fawksito: @nightmxz you can transfer them to the serv if you want
[1:56:40] fawksito: you can only create one

[1:57:00] happyheals: he makes the wowhead guides still I think
[1:57:19] nightmxz: I'm not sending blizz $25 to have 2 dragons on the same realm lmao
[1:57:26] dickman911: one of my biggest adjustments to healing shuffle is to use my CDs a bit earlier than you might normally do so to avoid overlap
[1:57:37] frazzoqt: just dont die
[1:57:47] NJMcChillan: in high keys a moonkin has to bear form every mechanic or they die
[1:57:53] NJMcChillan: doesnt matter if theres a healer at that point
[1:57:55] ferahgok: i think because agency has been taken out of dps's survivability this expansion compared to last
[1:57:57] ImJordanHi: Tank drops aggro accidentally or picks up a random ad and it just 1 shots a mage lol
[1:58:03] Kieara_: Hows the -50 buddy
[1:58:10] ferahgok: dps had more self heals and living capabilities last xpac
[1:58:15] ferahgok: which is why double dps was a thing
[1:58:15] frazzoqt: In pve bomy in bear form has less hp than a hunter with the same ilvl
[1:58:25] DirtyYankee0: -15 for me atm Sadge

[2:07:57] dickman911: @LucidFox9 dreamwalker embrace i believe
[2:08:52] What_ln_Tarnation: i think evokers look ugly, i can never play them because im a visual player
[2:08:53] FreddoB: their voices really complement each other
[2:09:45] atomic_gossipgirlxo: This doesn't look like a good mm lobby
[2:09:46] Faintestedge: you've had some big greenlizard moments for sure

[2:10:05] Hiraad: they really dont look cool
[2:10:06] IIyena: yea visage form looks dope tho
[2:10:26] AstralScare: they just need to enable people to play in the human form
[2:10:30] backstreetalright: they look baby savage
[2:11:05] What_ln_Tarnation: @IIyena uh... no
[2:11:12] tidusisthedream: if u get tier from vault and u turn it into regular conq gear?
[2:11:20] What_ln_Tarnation: visage just looks like a belf with glitter and lipstick
[2:11:46] FreddoB: @what_ln_tarnation uh… no
[2:12:01] Snoogns: human?
[2:12:03] What_ln_Tarnation: @FreddoB dont ever uno reverse my uh no ever again
[2:12:06] IIyena: @What_ln_Tarnation thats your opinion and so is mine. most dont like derp dragon
[2:12:16] omniboy12: Which class would you say has the most potential to have an impact on a game when played well?
[2:12:20] Gotheels: did you know there’s a way you can bug and be human visage form by using time stop in starting room
[2:12:24] IIyena: sub rogue
[2:12:31] marshallbs13: Hi guys any enhancement shaman streamr
[2:12:43] Gotheels: cdew did it last night
[2:12:52] dickman911: @marshallbs13 that loveless guy i think
[2:12:58] heymomimonttv: @marshallbs13 saul / joefernandes / loveless
[2:13:06] smoochins: saul too

[2:14:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sweet
[2:14:14] SgtPepperTTV: Ven man you are making me wanna come do some arena pvp againnnnn
[2:14:19] Phorians: @venruki I posted some stuff on DIscord so you better share some hiking photos as well. Closed Discord for now tho, check back in later. Heading off in 10-15.
[2:14:24] SgtPepperTTV: SIXOH!
[2:14:27] crymorre: i believe in the greenlizard
[2:14:28] What_ln_Tarnation: presv getting buffs too
[2:14:35] tidusisthedream: HEY GUYS CAN U UNTIER GEAR THAT U GET IN VAULT BACK TO CONQ PC?
[2:14:42] NJMcChillan: no
[2:14:58] YoMamaSoFine69: when are they getting buffed?
[2:15:00] NJMcChillan: getting essence burst off reversion does sound kind of insane
[2:15:03] nightmxz: pres should be the best healer because it is the most fun :)
[2:15:06] What_ln_Tarnation: @shooklate tues
[2:15:11] tidusisthedream: ty njmc
[2:15:15] illiteratex: where are the changes?
[2:15:16] artagore: Some tunnings incoming ?
[2:15:32] SteLawBro: Gonna have to change this chars name to venruki cause we evoker mains now.
[2:15:43] backstreetalright: yeah but is there anything new/insteresting next patch? I don’t sense it
[2:16:44] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Rep the dots, trap the dots
[2:16:54] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Aff in SS is awful
[2:17:11] FreddoB: wp
[2:17:11] Gotheels: 2200 pres gamer pog
[2:17:14] Nerfmetodeath: that pal was afk the first 35 secs idk why they didn't just blow cds and kill someone in the opener
[2:17:25] agren13: 50-0 in 0,5sec noice
[2:17:31] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Judgejobrown WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:17:35] McLarge: What buffs are coming in for Pres? I can't find any notes
[2:17:41] Judgejobrown: Judgejobrown subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 2200 gamer Pog
[2:17:46] MaximumnNeo: 2200 on a healer is high right now, its top 100 on basically all specs
[2:17:46] kking15: pres sucks so thats good
[2:17:51] Ultramagnus85: i'm struggling at 1500 on preservation
[2:18:02] jag_pvp: multi duelist lets gooo
[2:18:05] Magottx: Congrats glizzy guy rukiParty
[2:18:15] nightmxz: nah dude play it up, pres sucks and you're a god :)
[2:18:18] SteLawBro: 2200 evoker has to be like top 5% or something so you killin it.
[2:18:20] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Stadman going to be sitting real pretty qing his ww/dk/pres after buffs
[2:18:32] Gotheels: 2211 is #40 on ladder  pretty solid
[2:18:44] nightmxz: more free echoes, more free disintegrates Kreygasm
[2:18:59] Juliio29: I just think pres was designed as a pve healer more than a pvp healer just due to no damage reduction like every other healer has or an insane absorb
[2:19:00] Snoogns: oh snap
[2:19:00] McLarge: Ahh, so they're making Reversion even more important
[2:19:01] enji_1: @venruki as mw how do you like to position with locks on ur team
[2:19:02] Snoogns: that's HUGE
[2:19:09] enji_1: esp on zugumbala
[2:19:18] McLarge: Yeah, it's insane
[2:19:29] skez_live: can they delete Rewind and make something that works?
[2:19:30] Prox57: Same with PoM
[2:19:32] McLarge: Pres might be best healer in game after that
[2:19:34] aaggros: buffed when?
[2:19:46] NJMcChillan: it still has the worst cds but the throughput might jsut make it not matter
[2:19:49] NJMcChillan: god i hate rewind
[2:19:56] AndroniusMaximus: are we seeing rdruid nerfs?
[2:20:04] CoachZedOW: scales 2x
[2:20:18] NJMcChillan: dilation is still the full damage you jsut have more time to heal it
[2:20:20] eceria: But pres evoker doesnt have magic buff protection
[2:20:25] nightmxz: I just wish pres mage had more synergy, I think it would allow mage to play more aggro
[2:20:27] eceria: dispell protection I meant
[2:20:41] Borngood: :O
[2:20:58] McLarge: Pres is generally considered a counter to RDruid, and it's already pretty good. So if it's getting buffed then it might just take over the #1 Healer position
[2:21:03] NJMcChillan: ya i just die to it in damp
[2:21:09] NJMcChillan: once in a while
[2:21:26] nightmxz: You can play the thing that shorten's its CD too
[2:21:35] nightmxz: you can have like a 40sec CD time dilate next patch I imagine
[2:21:40] 3KuLTV: play some WW
[2:21:45] Yoruus: Most problems are with dps who don't know how to play with Evoker or Fistweaver Monk for that instance @venruki
[2:21:47] illiteratex: yo can u go over all the changes on tues?
[2:21:59] illiteratex: cant find em
[2:22:02] ATHLTE: rsham?
[2:22:23] skez_live: how about some hPal games too :)
[2:22:32] PhDickens: PREACH
[2:22:36] PhDickens: they pump but it's just not fun
[2:22:37] Sosatko: Its like a bad rogue I feel like
[2:22:41] CoachZedOW: i want to be more tanky on WW
[2:22:44] What_ln_Tarnation: too many micro CCs wreck WWs
[2:22:44] isseswagger: everyone cc them
[2:22:45] famous1939: i'm enjoying it up to the 1.8 level so far. but know what you mean. still having fun tho
[2:22:46] Sosatko: rogue gets goes every 20 sec ww gets goes every 1m
[2:22:47] ATHLTE: agreed
[2:23:01] Raskopp: this sham set looks really great
[2:23:02] 3KuLTV: dont say that. im currently leveling one
[2:23:03] rekt1370: always hated keefers
[2:23:04] famous1939: i actually find it kind of smooth rn but it can still be frustrating
[2:23:04] nightmxz: That's how I feel about mage, I just don't like the current style and design
[2:23:04] 6ixohfour: karma is dogshit
[2:23:05] Sosatko: 5m cd on wall rogues havea  15 sec cd on feint lol
[2:23:11] IIyena: yea just cc serenity lol
[2:23:13] Snoogns: like ww vs mage both people hate the fight I feel
[2:23:20] McLarge: I know most WW mains hate Images, but I swear Serenity is just as easy to CC
[2:23:26] What_ln_Tarnation: biggest issue is WWs dont have a dev
[2:24:29] joyrex_j9: everyone hates SEF because its buggy
[2:25:02] poasa21: wonder if arcane is fun to play
[2:25:21] McLarge: @joyrex_j9 The most common complaint I hear about it is that it's too easy to just root the Images and walk away
[2:25:37] aragarde: storm earth and fire would be good if you could toggle it off and on during its cd duration until its gone and then can do so again like the usage still gets used but you can put it back and back out... like a fast hunter pet
[2:26:23] What_ln_Tarnation: what if when you hit SEF again, instead of clones all attacking your target, they combined into you instead and just buffed your dam by 35%
[2:27:37] IIyena: so like a better serenity
[2:27:46] aragarde: I feel like it would be nice but like all things it would need testing giving a flat buff like that is pretty strong and would need some balancing
[2:27:56] What_ln_Tarnation: serenity's buff comes from its CDR not dam buff %
[2:27:57] McLarge: @IIyena With 2 charges. That seems to be the suggestion
[2:28:17] What_ln_Tarnation: and free chi cost
[2:28:19] IIyena: ye would have to nerf the dam on it a good bit for that
[2:28:51] What_ln_Tarnation: it'll be unchanged in damage, ONLY difference is you only worry about yourself instead of your clones getting cc'd
[2:29:09] SteLawBro: Monks talents are buggy to fit the drunken lore. Its balanced to only work half the time. If you dont want to drink play a priest or something.
[2:29:48] McLarge: I don't think that's the correct way to go about. WW already has Serenity, there's not much of a reason to change Images to be similar to Serenity
[2:29:55] IIyena: ^ yea
[2:30:10] What_ln_Tarnation: guess SEF buffs dam by 26% now, it was nerfed, so the clones would merge into you and buff your dam by 26%
[2:30:32] McLarge: Tbh, I think WW just needs Fist Stun back
[2:30:42] What_ln_Tarnation: nah, game doesnt need more CCs
[2:30:44] McLarge: When I play it, it feels like it's just missing another Stun
[2:30:55] What_ln_Tarnation: we need to prune CCs not add more
[2:31:28] What_ln_Tarnation: maybe add a stun pvp honor to SOTWL which already has a longer CD
[2:31:31] McLarge: Micro CCs need pruned, for sure. But Stuns aren't really what you would call Micro CCs
[2:32:08] lundbergmackan: What does CDR mean
[2:32:30] ItsBees: cooldown reduction
[2:32:47] aragarde: the problem with pruning ccs is that they always revert to buffing burst damage
[2:32:47] Moobot: Latest video "Polling Tier Set Bonuses Is Terrible For PvP Players" view it here: youtu.be/DuSRJz8Zsbo
[2:32:49] jag_pvp: whats in the oatmeal
[2:32:51] aragarde: then people will complain about that
[2:32:52] McLarge: Maybe it doesn't need to be Fist Stun, but WW would benefit a lot from having a 2nd stun
[2:33:19] zachgamegodx: @jag_pvp paid actort
[2:33:38] Ryan_Gilbert: omg its the battle mender
[2:33:38] zachgamegodx: no way someone asks that everytime you have oatmeal
[2:33:54] jag_pvp: its important information
[2:34:14] McLarge: Well that was mean LUL
[2:34:17] NJMcChillan: KEKW
[2:34:23] JustTaki: sooo rude
[2:34:26] BrofessorBox: lil harsh
[2:34:28] JustTaki: Kappa
[2:34:33] 3KuLTV: i dont get why people fight shamans and hunters so close to the edge of cliffs lmao
[2:34:51] McLarge: What do you think WW needs, Ven?
[2:35:01] Omnadren: nerf KEKW
[2:35:24] wackpoetic: They need a PvP Talent that makes Fists of Fury a castable Buff (at reduced damage) instead of a channel
[2:35:25] McLarge: What was old SEF like?\
[2:35:34] wackpoetic: replace that garbage new FoF cleave PvP Talent that they added
[2:35:41] isseswagger: bring back tigereye brew its times
[2:35:49] baxter5569: how much mastery do you have @venruki for resto? I like ele, but i admit i suck at it :( and i just get clobbered by triple melee lobbies. i want to try resto and if I have more fun, but only have 60 mastery or so
[2:35:55] BrofessorBox: launching it across the map and spinning a rogue out of stealth
[2:35:58] nightmxz: old SEF Kreygasm
[2:36:08] baxter5569: 60%
[2:36:21] 3KuLTV: serenity the way to go now instead of SEF?
[2:36:35] McLarge: @3KuLTV That's how its been all expac
[2:36:42] Ryan_Gilbert: omg full pali hex
[2:36:50] What_ln_Tarnation: hes pooping so many procs
[2:37:02] McLarge: Sanc was used
[2:37:04] 3KuLTV: @McLargeive not playued WW for a few xpacs
[2:37:06] McLarge: It's not cosmetic Pog
[2:37:25] skez_live: I love how much control shaman seems to have
[2:37:30] 3KuLTV: @McLarge currently leveling one
[2:37:59] NJMcChillan: @McLarge lmao literally every ret takes it cuz they see it on murlok or drustvar and it gets used 1/100 times
[2:38:00] McLarge: @3KuLTV I hope you enjoy playing it at 70! It pumps really hard
[2:38:07] pepiopi2: whats the addon that shows your rotation in bottom left
[2:38:21] skez_live: Trufigcd
[2:38:23] pepiopi2: ty
[2:39:04] wackpoetic: 3KuLTV Here's how it works: when a WW gets to cleave all game against classes with limited mobility and limited CC, it's the most insane damage and fun. When WW has to chase targets or has to deal with CC spam that it can't remove, you basically spend the whole game focused on surviving and baiting out CD's.
[2:39:48] feverdreaminww: catJAM
[2:40:17] rekt1370: guy had nether LUL
[2:40:42] seyvyur: maybe he went adaptation into that matchup?
[2:41:36] McLarge: You know, I just realized something about my personal bias for melee classes: I said WW needs a 2nd stun, but that would make it even more like DH and Arms Warrior (I play both). There's definitely an argument to be made that would be a homogenous mess
[2:41:58] Hottflashes: Hey Ven how  you liking shaman heals
[2:42:20] wackpoetic: If WW had a PvP talent that made FoF not a channel, it would feel so much better into DH/Arms
[2:42:30] MortemCorvus: !playlist

[2:43:30] IIyena: ill trade tide for bubble anyday lmao
[2:43:32] McLarge: Mage is made of paper, but you can't touch it so it feels incredibly durable as a melee
[2:43:48] IsaiahFrank: Just an fyi you can ghost wolf rep
[2:43:49] wackpoetic: pattarx WW needs changes. It has strong matchups and weak matchups for sure
[2:43:59] What_ln_Tarnation: other 2 doing 2X dam of your team
[2:44:12] What_ln_Tarnation: your ret is afk or something
[2:44:24] wackpoetic: ret indeed afk
[2:44:24] kand1nsky: ret dc
[2:44:25] What_ln_Tarnation: ret almost outdammed by hpal

[2:48:24] theodeth: I actually had a converstaion with a structural engineer i work with about that exact same topic the other day
[2:48:25] pattarx: omnicd can bug sometimes and not show trinket
[2:48:27] RhomenTV: 1930s, that must be one of the old WW1 army homes they built for returning soldiers
[2:48:29] DeityRevert: they don't because of planned obsolescence
[2:48:31] eceria: my house is built at 1960, im from Israel
[2:48:36] theodeth: they used to 'over-engineer' houses when they built them
[2:48:42] McLarge: *asbestos
[2:48:51] nightmxz: LMAO She sounds quite cozy then good for her
[2:48:54] maxdoesmath: what sword is that?
[2:48:55] theodeth: if you take a cross section of a wall from 100 years ago and compare to today, there's a huge difference in thicknesses and material

[2:49:20] caring_bull: we had -27 just a week ago, but felt worse than -40 tbh
[2:49:22] RhomenTV: if you got copper piping you very much have asbestos
[2:49:27] maxdoesmath: what sword do you have mogged?
[2:49:35] McLarge: I'm just messin' with you. I doubt it would pass any sort of inspection

[3:26:32] Hobblefoot: I don't think I have paid attention to Aff Lock in 2s. Should be fun to watch.

[4:28:44] rekt1370: arcane frost the best
[4:30:33] seholmes93: has he gotten glad yet?
[4:31:05] rekt1370: arcane prob the best mage spec
[4:31:10] Clonepeanut: Hey Ven.  I noticed most mages are not getting to 25% crit..  Does that mean shatter isnt guaranteed to crit?
[4:32:17] marshallbs13: You got comet srtorm and glac can you link your spec
[4:33:20] Swertson: are boomies still best caster?
[4:33:20] Moobot: Latest video "Polling Tier Set Bonuses Is Terrible For PvP Players" view it here: youtu.be/DuSRJz8Zsbo
[4:33:26] rekt1370: yea boomy best caster
[4:33:31] rekt1370: because of broken clone
[4:33:48] leeka: lol
[4:33:50] Xeliumimar: anyone know how his gladius displays kicks
[4:33:53] nicolai0912: Is Born streaming?
[4:34:05] drdoomkinx: we love rdruid
[4:34:09] flawfox: @rekt1370 Well those clones got denied well this game
[4:34:18] rekt1370: @flawfox  just a bad boomy
[4:34:34] doclovejr: I know you get asked all the time, but for someone who has never healed, whats a good class to start with?
[4:34:40] darrenchen2000: rdruid metas are so boring man
[4:34:41] setztes: resto druid needs a rework. Sincerely, a Rdruid main since Wotlk
[4:34:44] Geowind: my resto druid is about to ding to 70 : )
[4:35:01] RonWilson: so can you show how to play arcane echo
[4:35:04] Hizuru1: @setztes go play old game old man
[4:35:10] RonWilson: cause I usually get tempest up and spam missles
[4:35:23] setztes: @Hizuru1 hahaha fair. not like Wotlk was any better :p
[4:35:23] NPBeharry: Hpal is best starter healer imo @doclovejr
[4:35:36] chrisiirc: is ven like 6 foot 4/5?
[4:35:38] NPBeharry: best cds
[4:35:42] chrisiirc: almost as tall as door
[4:35:52] NPBeharry: he’s prob like 6’3”
[4:36:00] setztes: @Hizuru1 still, rdru is not fun playing nor playing against in its current iteration
[4:36:02] NPBeharry: if I had to guess
[4:36:06] chrisiirc: ah ye
[4:36:20] Hizuru1: @setztes don't play it then subjective
[4:36:21] isseswagger: maybe start heal as fistweaver if u playing melee
[4:36:48] setztes: @Hizuru1 problem is that all the other healers are worse to play. thats why no healers wanna play
[4:37:09] rekt1370: you can do well and get far with all healers but yea going vs a good resto druid is aids
[4:37:13] Hizuru1: @setztes don't see making druid shit Helps anyone KEKW
[4:37:19] rekt1370: druid just has it all rn
[4:37:35] setztes: @Hizuru1 never said anything about making it shit mate. i said it needs a rework
[4:37:51] Shezzmou: games always seem more fun from all the years i've played when rdruid isn't good
[4:37:59] Hizuru1: No worries chat they will give you bots sooner than making game fun
[4:38:18] drdoomkinx: yeah rdruid is just omega op rn its double the participation of any other healer 2100+
[4:38:33] Laythos: are we getting a ruki after dark tonight?
[4:38:46] Laythos: aight
[4:39:04] setztes: @drdoomkinx yeah might me my limited exp with other healers but i swear i just cant keep people alive with the other healers
[4:39:36] Hizuru1: @setztes disco got "rework" quite sure less people play it
[4:40:20] setztes: @Hizuru1 i could argue the reverse with the paladin rework. just depends on the execution
[4:41:19] setztes: @Hizuru1 moreover was disc not even more overpowered the patch before and rdru has since caught up. with the amount of FOTM rerollers that would make a decrease in disc more likelyh
[4:42:23] purkinji12: demo frost op
[4:42:26] purkinji12: love it
[4:43:57] RonWilson: meanwhile demo demo has coil, 2 stuns and fear
[4:44:41] Satedtv: 3 stuns
[4:44:45] spellgunx: frost one of the wort spec in 3s
[4:44:54] skez_live: druid
[4:44:59] skez_live: oh nm hah
[4:45:12] spellgunx: lol
[4:45:28] Polyrhythmz: As a warrior I didn't want to move anyway
[4:45:30] oxphoenixo: would aff lock be better for frost bomb dispel protection?
[4:45:35] Shezzmou: frost is so dumb. Just rotate your one shot over and over till it lands.
[4:45:39] raolh: fk havent heard this song in 15 years
[4:46:05] RonWilson: @Shezzmou you've described 10 specs
[4:46:22] Shezzmou: @RonWilson fair lol
[4:46:26] sourbutts: @Shezzmou obviously you dont play frost mage at decent rating because its impossible to play the game as frost
[4:47:06] Shezzmou: @sourbutts obviously i don't play frost at all because i don't wanna fall asleep at my keyboard
[4:47:30] sourbutts: shaman in your game? lose. you lose in 1v1 to every spec but warrior and paladin, everything but sub rogue has more through put than you, its actually only good vs idiots, easiest class to play against
[4:47:52] Shezzmou: SP is true pain imo
[4:48:05] RonWilson: you haven't played sp m8 @sourbutts
[4:48:22] Shezzmou: feels bad into melee but guess what also feels bad into casters lol
[4:48:38] sourbutts: @Shezzmou yeah into everything but frost mage lol
[4:48:46] RonWilson: it feels bad into frost mage
[4:48:54] sourbutts: not in a duel
[4:49:03] Shezzmou: no one cares about duels though
[4:49:04] RonWilson: what xD
[4:49:22] sourbutts: your issue isnt frost mage, its the other class with the frost mage allowing the frost mage to do stuff
[4:49:24] RonWilson: this isn't gurubashi in 2009 bro, duels are not a thing
[4:49:51] sourbutts: because spriest naturally beats mage, so youre wrong about it feeling bad into mage
[4:50:22] Shezzmou: lol sure
[4:50:25] RonWilson: idk what rating you're playing but it's literally the farthest thing from reality
[4:50:53] sourbutts: like 2k, spriest is bad yeah not saying it isnt, im just saying it does well into frost mage, maybe not arcane though
[4:52:56] atarri1: I love arena lingo
[4:54:58] rekt1370: the holy pally struggle
[4:55:04] rekt1370: them mana problems
[4:56:55] NJMcChillan: 11 minute game lol
[4:57:10] oxphoenixo: would aff lock be better for frost bomb dispel protection?
[4:57:23] rekt1370: aff lock might be insane but can dot healer
[4:57:26] rekt1370: cant
[4:57:50] purkinji12: have you ever qd fire destro again after that one q sesh with cdew lock
[4:57:54] Hizuru1: Healer diff should have drink water to keep hydrated
[4:58:52] ripzaddo: arcane orb going thru pillar and walls was sick id stop every drink so easy lol
[4:59:07] magnesiium1: is it bad to save orb later in the game to stop drinks? or is too much dam loss
[5:00:04] rekt1370: should try arcane demo its prob nuts
[5:00:07] rotbodi: are u strill drinking teh coffee since 5hrs?
[5:00:26] sourbutts: @rotbodi yeah its a big coffee man

[5:18:20] twinkieruler95: thats what thats the strat
[5:18:31] Bwrecker: that was very nice
[5:18:43] Alexxhaal: its a bit unfarn. Ven counts as 2 dps
[5:18:50] Alexxhaal: unfair*
[5:18:51] Hizuru1: @flawfox I don't know any game which makes you perform worse except rigged cod Ai matchmaking, imagine you do less dmg longer you play
[5:18:51] Nuallan94: wow arena is great
[5:18:54] Bronloch: mage lock mirror do you base strat off healer differences?
[5:20:17] jheas1: does damp affect ice block heal ?
[5:20:18] NozakGaming: thats what awc would like if rogues didnt exist lol
[5:20:27] rekt1370: @jheas1  yea
[5:20:30] Hizuru1: +
[5:20:40] JakloomGaming770: rogues are awful
[5:20:44] flawfox: @Hizuru1 Bro are you insane? If the game goes to 98% damp it’s def no point to avoid playing healers. Arena design just needs something to end games eventually. Elsewise top players might have a stalemate when cds are traded perfectly etc.
[5:21:44] Bronloch: idk i think that was a great match and should be an example
[5:22:01] Hizuru1: @flawfox should design game better and block some addons
[5:22:16] Pingabreath: do you have any tips for new devoker player?
[5:22:22] flawfox: @Hizuru1 we have different opinions there
[5:22:36] magnesiium1: mw also has revival to drag the game on

[5:42:35] Bronloch: gotta force rdruid to keep both dps hotted at all times?
[5:43:07] setztes: @Bronloch best thing is to constantly swap to whomever has no lifebloom and cen ward
[5:43:19] Bronloch: agreed
[5:43:38] setztes: @Bronloch keeping 2 people alive i EZ for rdru. 3 people is significantly harder
[5:44:42] eefybeef14: does anyone know if timewalking is up rn since i swear thats the best way to level apart from boosting

[5:51:42] Miekstro: @hellshifterd yeah? i mean rdruids can die no?
[5:51:45] Hiraad: @norethern thats how it should be, why shouldnt he be able to top his team when he isnt in cc and has mana
[5:51:50] Miekstro: then again maybe not lol
[5:52:13] Miekstro: @Hiraad you must play rdruid. youre missing the main point, which was how much healing he did
[5:52:24] Miekstro: while also being able to afk drink easily
