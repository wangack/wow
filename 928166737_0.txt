[0:48:17] Clicklesly: Dailies kinda made the respec cost more managable iirc though
[0:48:20] cryft: dual spec is a step away from "i'm a disc priest" towards "i'm a healer"
[0:48:36] aeon0987: Not sure how i would feel about a functional LFG in classic or TBC would be.
[0:48:39] cryft: big hit to unique characters if you can have one spec for everything you do

[0:54:21] izabeL: farming gold
[0:54:22] sprert: @Grailzz leveling and gold frming for flying

[0:54:55] sprert: normal 800g+100g for mount
[0:55:07] sprert: epic is 5k extra
[0:55:11] rohdey: a line?
[0:55:15] Grailzz: Chat can you do faction transfers in classic or was that like a MoPish era thing?
[0:55:16] cormander002: is that like a 5 hour energy?
[0:55:18] Stringerrs: drogs
[0:55:20] SonofHorus82: I straight up did NOT like Scorpion Sting. I love the mango, just not the spice.
[0:55:21] rohdey: of cayenne pepper? Kappa
[0:55:28] nobones9: why no camera lately?
[0:55:33] aeon0987: we gotta get 5k whew
[0:55:37] aeon0987: thats going to be pricey
[0:55:37] zoobu2: @Towelliee do you think they'll solve the insane queue time problem on big servers for this launch?
[0:55:38] MOLAR305: wasnt the normal flyer like 70% speed?
[0:55:52] Kagoon46: 60%
[0:56:07] sprert: yeah and if you don't have enough gold after getting 70 just quest a bit more. quests give more gold after max level
[0:56:08] Kinghorn: mats are going to be so expensive on the AH only the 1% will be able to afford herb and ores at first
[0:56:10] PieceOfPanic: It's going to be a shitshow
[0:56:16] PieceOfPanic: TBC will flop
[0:56:19] Exxcar: @bunk3000 that's not a problem to fix. if you play on a super popular realm, you have to deal with queues

[0:58:34] branTVx: @Towelliee are u gonna main tank raid bosses as prot pally?
[0:58:39] Aeain: Stalagg has no alliance population and guilds are starting to leave for TBC
[0:59:34] Sacrolush: prot pala was op in tbc
[0:59:50] izabeL: I left Pagle for a low pop server because it will be a hot mess comes launch
[1:00:23] bigrsmith: in cave if I remember
[1:00:33] rosina_scarlett: purple crystals
[1:00:37] TheZlare: Purple crystals along cave walls
[1:00:44] Xxpiredtv: click the purple crystals
[1:00:44] gilbonzowarchief: well @Towelliee heyyyy
[1:00:50] Foolman21: When do you think TBC classic wlll launch?
[1:01:08] Aeain: Yeah, Stalagg going to be nice because its low-pop, so TBC leveling should be easier. I know my guild has a wait and see approach right now. Meaning after we all hit 70 if the server still sucks we might leave
[1:01:18] Apokolipz: you no take candle
[1:01:20] SonofHorus82: for questie, the cog wheels means there's a pickup item, the bag means it's a mob drop.

[1:03:44] Rasulki: I wish the classic horde cat form was half as decent as the alliance cat form
[1:03:58] killawatts75: so the 58 boosts will only be for BC servers correct?
[1:03:58] AgeeR_: !tbc
[1:03:58] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now!
[1:04:01] Exxcar: So what would be a "fresh" server?
[1:04:39] dcmaniac11: Towelliee I believe you can stay in cat form while ur getting those crystals I could be wrong tho
[1:04:40] SonofHorus82: I was really hoping they were going to release a phase 1 classic server again.
[1:04:50] Alienfromger: isnt bc supposed to be leveling fun?
[1:04:52] PieceOfPanic: It's a bad decison to make it like this.
[1:05:08] VictorAvalanche: you because you think its bad don't make it bad
[1:05:09] Nottinghams: prepatch make leveling faster?
[1:05:11] Clicklesly: Wonder if the level nerfs are in prepatch too ^^
[1:05:16] 79rockbottom: @Towelliee - Can you share the experience bar that you use for classic?
[1:05:21] jellyjim_: are people still going for rank 14 those days?
[1:05:35] PieceOfPanic: It's bad for the econmy on those servers.
[1:05:36] Exxcar: @Clicklesly its patch 2.4.3 so leveling changes should be in at launch
[1:05:36] TombStoneMercenary: Any thoughts on people paying for Instance boost's?
[1:05:40] PieceOfPanic: And bad for the gatekeeping
[1:05:43] sprert: the 58-boost is pretty clever advertisement wise. big streamers who want to ride the tbc-wave without playing classic before that can do that then
[1:05:51] PieceOfPanic: We'll have an A-team and a B-team among players.
[1:05:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: JC $_$
[1:05:59] OJWestTV: do some deathrolls
[1:06:11] Nottinghams: so many players in the economy, things be inflated. Dont think gold will be the issue it was back in tbc
[1:06:22] Exxcar: @Towelliee I'm curious, what would a "fresh" server be? I've heard about it a lot lately but I'm not sure what it is or what the appeal would be
[1:06:31] killawatts75: how much easier would say having t3/t2 going into bc would make the leveling process in BC? or could a fresh 60 do it fairly easily? im afraid ill be behind the curve on gear due to my later start in classic
[1:06:35] iblighters: now you have  to go back lo
[1:06:37] PieceOfPanic: Well, not inside guilds.. But on whole servers.
[1:06:38] iblighters: lol*
[1:06:53] CrucifyMTG: Do I need to be a certain level in classic to whisper?
[1:07:01] PieceOfPanic: Fresh servers would be the best decision.
[1:07:07] ebone45: how long before TBC classic launch do u think they will let us lvl Dranei and BE?
[1:07:12] MOLAR305: fresh as in new, not fresh as in DOPE
[1:07:21] Bruin44: Spain without the s
[1:07:21] Sacrolush: theraputic
[1:07:27] Exxcar: to each their own I'm sure :P
[1:07:30] br0fest0r: yeah fuck that
[1:07:30] Alienfromger: leveling is the most fun point in mmorpgs :)
[1:07:33] killawatts75: @ebone45 i'd say like july
[1:07:39] TombStoneMercenary: And they love to buy instance boost's and screw plebs over.....

[1:09:45] SonofHorus82: wait... so because Towelliee welcomed me into the guild does that mean he thinks I'm a good person? towPog towPog
[1:09:54] cyllos: @Towelliee I'm interested in joining in on the Hammer Squad guild but I'm an east coast player, would all the raids/events happen way too late for me?
[1:10:02] cynical_effect12: @Towelliee did you see where Watson told the Texans HC he is out
[1:10:11] K0rzak0v: why no cam?
[1:10:21] xImmortalGodx: !cam
[1:10:21] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[1:10:29] Kray_CS: Are there people still levling or does the world feel dead nowadays? @Towelliee

[1:11:02] SonofHorus82: yeah that's late for me :(. I work early :(
[1:11:26] killawatts75: will the guild be casual or would you be taking the best classes/specs to min max in raid? @Towelliee
[1:11:30] cyllos: @Towelliee thats actually not late for me, I don't go to bed until midnight / 1am
[1:11:34] Noshpan: I chuckled to myself the first time I saw the guild name.
[1:11:35] tainas101: There is over 50 low lvls in each of the starting zones on gehennas eu its insane
[1:11:38] Artivicii: Blood bath and beyond KEKW
[1:11:48] BraerHZ: i wish we had a better idea for release of BC. July '21 is a big difference than Dec '21
[1:12:00] PieceOfPanic: I mean, if u are gonna allow people to go keep their classic chars in TBC.. Then instead of selling 1-58 boost, why not just sell fully fledged chars with Black Battle tank, Full Naxx gear and 1 legendary free of choice?
[1:12:03] cynical_effect12: Towelliee who gets traded first, Watson or Russell Wilson
[1:12:10] killawatts75: @HexedZero its more than likely summer since classics 2 year mark is august

[1:39:32] pk99: better off pvping if your class needs vers
[1:39:50] A_New_Challenger: Also, remember that lvl 9s don't have prideful yet (I think haven't run yet this xpac) so you might find more carries at lvl 9 then 8 because of people who want to go down a few levels and speed run before the additional affix kicks in
[1:39:51] hectylus: does feral has alot of keybinds?
[1:40:08] swampt1l: 7 in the vault is 213
[1:40:13] swampt1l: and a 8 and 9 is 216

[1:43:42] A_New_Challenger: Gratz - hope it was an upgrade!
[1:43:56] LoseAlotLuke: i wonder how wows sub numbers have changed from SL launch to now @Towelliee
[1:43:57] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Tis is the quest where you're gonna level up from grinding.
[1:44:25] A_New_Challenger: I am going to get the timewalking mount one of these days...prob right after I get my hands on black onyx :) lol
[1:44:29] WytherOK: shit that dragon sac from badlands
[1:44:46] SlowpokeIsAGamer: @LoseAlotLuke Saw one report that their numbers are back to "normal" from SLs launch.
[1:45:03] Rasulki: I'm one of them :)
[1:45:30] N3llee: same my friends list dropped like a rock this time around. Prob more so then any other xpac
[1:45:32] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I honestly never even started. I bought Shadowlands and the date came and I was just like pieShrug
[1:46:07] LoseAlotLuke: they seem a liittle stuck in a weird place atm
[1:46:07] idenkaz_: how dare you to be honest with them. CouldYouNot
[1:46:33] GodKingMuninn: Investors need to shut the fuck up, let blizzard do what they do. They made WoW great. They don't need a clueless fuck telling them how to do it
[1:46:43] NOHITJEROME: ya and anthem dead again LUL
[1:46:46] NOHITJEROME: died twice
[1:46:54] LoseAlotLuke: F for Anthem lmao
[1:46:58] swampt1l: Deadpunk KEKW
[1:46:59] SlowpokeIsAGamer: The delay was yeah like 3 weeks. People with an eye on Blizz called it like 2 weeks earlier because they had missed the traditional pre-patch date with no announcement of even when it would be.
[1:47:03] Thex552: vampire bloodlines 2 canceld :(
[1:47:18] Layercake: This year a lot of games/expansions are going to be late ...its the a miracle we still get the games in 2020...2021 is going to be rough
[1:47:47] A_New_Challenger: careful for that DMCA - that was spot on
[1:48:18] sprert: atleast we get outriders at 1st of april and it looks kinda good

[1:48:34] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Yeah this is the year where we're gonna pay the price for last year.

[1:49:36] michaisn: just played it and uninstalled it after 20mins
[1:49:41] Alienfromger: its like devision with blood
[1:49:55] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Well right now Endwalker is just generic "Fall" but people are speculating probably October because they've been running roughly 2 months behind schedule. So HOPEFULLY we get 9.1 by then.
[1:49:56] Layercake: Nothing to do with Destiny ...more like Division
[1:49:56] A_New_Challenger: is outriders more looter shoot or survival? or I guess both...
[1:50:02] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[1:50:04] Phantom_wulfstan: its not a love service game @towelliee just a rpg
[1:50:18] WytherOK: it's a glitchy slow ungodly mess
[1:50:21] sprert: 20 minutes? did you even finish the prolog?
[1:50:25] Mr_Pennywise_: there is a lot of hate for it right now dont know why thow
[1:50:34] GiraffeHydra_: Combat is enjoyable, unsure of its lasting power. And no glitches here personally
[1:50:36] Mr_Pennywise_: looks ok to me thow
[1:50:41] Phantom_wulfstan: slow? lol game is fast af
[1:50:41] chintzypop: Do casters go oom every other cast in tbc like classic?
[1:51:03] sprert: login servers were/are fucked...people hate that
[1:51:41] michaisn: It feels like a game thats made for the sake of making a game, can't feel the passion
[1:51:45] swampt1l: that stuff is sketchy,i never buy anything from Square enix if its not FF
[1:51:52] Moronil: if yoship isn't there, my faith is lost LUL
[1:51:57] idenkaz_: tomb raider reboot was solid imo.
[1:52:13] swampt1l: poor anthem man
[1:52:23] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I'm amazed Bioware survived Anthem. Usually with EA devs that's a death sentence.
[1:52:41] swampt1l: Dude Im fucking hoping EA doesnt mess up Dragon Age 4
[1:52:54] GiraffeHydra_: @michaisn I do have to give them props for putting a full demo out instead of a last minute beta. Gives people good amount of time to test it out. And the world/lore is enough to intrigue
[1:53:07] A_New_Challenger: I really enjoyed the reboot and think all 3 were good, but a little too much of the same for my taste...the first reboot is def one of my favorite games (I think I like uncharted a little more tbh though)
[1:53:22] Layercake: EA finally get that the live service model is not for them...and let Bioware do what they do best

[1:53:46] swampt1l: Im really hoping they dont screw up Dragon age 4
[1:53:48] michaisn: @SensualMurderHornets yea I agree
[1:54:12] lithium364: people just hyped for god of war trailer
[1:54:30] sprert: Anthem was not EA'S fault. Bioware had like 6-7 years of devolment time und effectivly used maybe 2
[1:54:35] swampt1l: i mean God of War is nuts
[1:54:41] mavericks312: nah GoW is atleast a year and a half away
[1:54:44] swampt1l: i think they might have a trailer
[1:54:55] lithium364: bioware doesnt really exist tbh, like 80% of the staff that did dragon age 3 left
[1:55:11] jffrancis: Big shout out to rasury123 for the gifted sub Much appreciated
[1:55:34] swampt1l: I wonder if there will be any news about Ff16
[1:56:07] bruhfock: EA is a trash company. Come out with decent games here and there but overall quality and service is horrible
[1:56:16] SlowpokeIsAGamer: FF16 news I feel like is "E3" stuff
[1:56:25] Arcon_LP: What happened to your camera? Or did you get shy? :)
[1:56:33] SlowpokeIsAGamer: !cam
[1:56:33] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[1:57:14] swampt1l: @SlowpokeIsAGamer i need it man
[1:57:54] NILLme: hope they dont fuck up Battlefield
[1:58:09] raldrik: Well to be fair sports games they just change the names and release the new year. Maybe add a few texture updates
[1:58:10] SlowpokeIsAGamer: EA is a very deadline-driven company. Even the sports games. When the deadline comes you shove it out, no matter how unfinished it is. "We can fix it with patches."
[1:58:12] NOHITJEROME: nobody can stand up to the publishers unfortunately
[1:58:15] Sacrolush: EA should just start three months earlier....lol
[1:58:19] NOHITJEROME: i thought cd projekt red but now im not sure
[1:58:23] swampt1l: did they announce another battlefield? @NiLLx_
[1:58:25] Exxcar: You will make more money waiting till spring and selling a better product then getting it out in the holiday "Golden" window
[1:58:42] RenaShirow: Bioware has had leadership and direction issues too though, Mass Effect Andromeda suffered because of that as well :/
[1:58:46] sprert: it is kinda hard to explain to the publisher that a game that is in development for 6 years is not finished
[1:59:13] Alienfromger: new world adding isntanced dungeons aswell. perhaps amazon learned his lesson
[1:59:19] Broomba: what quest is that @towelliee for whiskers?
[1:59:27] Phantom_wulfstan: lol cdpr went full mask off on all its fans
[1:59:39] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Yeah New World is learning a lot of lessons from the feedback people gave and they're acting on it before launch. I have high hopes for them.
[1:59:58] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee  As long as the july beta is still real. I'm cool

[2:00:41] NILLme: @SwapT1_ yeah but nothing official yet. Announce in spring, release during the holidays
[2:01:32] Phantom_wulfstan: @towelliee nah with all that pro consumer  stuff and how we not like other companies and they sure enough are just like other companies

[3:16:09] Pubstar_LTD: @Exxcar Boosts ruin the ENTIRE point of having classic servers
[3:16:19] Pubstar_LTD: if we gonna retailfy it
[3:16:25] branTVx: the boosts arent for classic servers bud
[3:16:26] branTVx: only for TBC
[3:16:27] Kinghorn: chrslp towelliee got it on his first kill the other day LUL
[3:16:32] Kinghorn: it was nuts
[3:16:33] Pubstar_LTD: @bran_1015 classic tbc
[3:16:36] chrslp: @Kinghorn wtf LUL
[3:16:38] Exxcar: @Pubstar_LTD it won't be classic, it will be TBC and there are a lot of people who want to play TBC and don't want to touch classic
[3:16:51] Pubstar_LTD: @Exxcar classic tbc tho
[3:16:56] branTVx: what..
[3:16:57] chrslp: Ive literally been here farmin for this emerald for over half an hour
[3:17:26] Shrenko: @Towelliee look at this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/300972611171516416/814602617455116298/zabhxaq7yij61.png towLul towLul
[3:17:29] Pubstar_LTD: the wow community is literally insane or is it just me
[3:17:35] Veegore: @Pubstar_LTD "classic tbc tho" so what. people want to play tbc not vanilla, so they'll boost past the bit they don't want and get into tbc because they want it. stop grasping at straws.  More people playing the better, no matter how they get to end game.
[3:17:44] Sincline387: Towelliee the newest classic andy!
[3:17:54] Exxcar: @Pubstar_LTD would you prefer all those people just not play classic TBC at all and you loose out on a massive popluation?
[3:18:07] Pubstar_LTD: imagine buying a game, then paying again to skip half the game
[3:18:08] Pubstar_LTD: KEKW
[3:18:09] Kromede: good food FeelsBadMan
[3:18:16] Exxcar: @Pubstar_LTD you don't pay for TBC
[3:18:20] Sincline387: Her stream says asian inspired noodle soup
[3:18:32] Pubstar_LTD: @Exxcar wow sub is about 3 AAA games PER YEAR
[3:18:34] TheUnknowing: I forget to buff myself half the time
[3:18:37] branTVx: @Pubstar_LTD to some people, leveling is 0% of the game, in fact, its tedious to them
[3:18:44] Veegore: @Exxcar at this point, don't bother feeding the troll anymore lol
[3:18:45] Pubstar_LTD: it is tedious to me too
[3:18:50] Pubstar_LTD: doesnt mean they should remove it no
[3:18:51] averis12: Is it good? Sounds good? The soup I mean
[3:19:06] branTVx: @Pubstar_LTD its an optional service bud, get over it go cry somewhere else
[3:19:07] Pubstar_LTD: anyway - enough discussing - dont wanna ruin the vibe here
[3:19:10] Pubstar_LTD: i see your points

[3:20:30] Cheeseezard: Horde has a flightpath at the beach near BFD
[3:20:39] Keyastaron_: whats yr total time played?
[3:20:46] Clicklesly: There's the Felwood FP you can get that's close to the middle too ^^
[3:21:08] metavahn231: its so ironic that alliance had way more people back in the day, might of been why they gave horde better racials in tbc
[3:21:25] Kromede: not me FeelsBadMan

[3:40:39] Jimmy__Ricard: An actual active moderation team is all any game ever needs, but game Dev's never want to pay out the money to create/maintain these teams.  Harder than most in games like WoW with the amount of servers/languages it covers

[3:44:40] TweakT: VapeNation VapeNayshe
[3:44:44] BakedApe77: Blizz wont do anything unless ingame
[3:44:50] Lostdogal: How come I can see all sorts of logs on players in this game but nothing about the quality of their character with fellow players? RacistIO needs to be a new addon lol
[3:44:51] BakedApe77: Sadly
[3:44:55] Dr_CeeMan: Please keep those admins and mods out of League community :)
[3:44:56] TweakT: what are we talking abewt
[3:45:07] chumdawggg: why you leveling druid and not use boost ?
[3:45:11] MrGattz: OW you fart in the wrong direction and get banned. not that i think its a bad thing. but you basically just dont talk ever
[3:45:15] Kinghorn: kelpLUL

[3:45:27] Holyshower: i member
[3:45:33] TheUnknowing: HIJ was super racist
[3:45:42] Wildside1177: so much bogus screaming of "racist" in the world.
[3:45:42] TweakT: to each other, with love
[3:45:46] SouperTV: I heard someone bring up in my guild that they thought badges might not be in TBC at start, I think they are smoking crack
[3:45:53] schelest_: true
[3:46:24] MrGattz: imo if your intent isnt to hurt someone and your just fooling around with friends that also just dont care, than why police it.
[3:46:26] Shrenko: do you use the addon Maze helper on retail @Towelliee ?
[3:46:34] spacemarine55: ya but you can never win that arguement because there is always someone who says im black i can say it
[3:46:34] averis12: As soon as you say something is taboo, people are going to do/say that thing
[3:46:37] spacemarine55: then where do you go lol
[3:46:43] Nottinghams: isnt that called a pvp guild Kappa
[3:47:00] TheItalianStallion321: i left a guild at the end of BFA that went 12/12M CE b/c of the N word being said CONSTANTLY in discord, i couldnt stand it
[3:47:03] TweakT: ye discord is a different web realm
[3:47:04] MrGattz: yo chat DM me ingame if you want a tbc guild invite Gatt
[3:47:08] Screamnsteam: that would be over reaching for sure
[3:47:33] mrniceguy817: Personally I can’t stand the cringe shit men say when they hear a chick in discord in pug raids holy shit that grinds my gears
[3:47:35] MrGattz: 10 years ago people didnt care.
[3:47:45] rocthenite: this remind me when people use asmongold videos from 2014 to cancel him because he defended a female streamer
[3:47:48] HaloS23: @Towelliee You used to say Naga alot inplace of it. since have stopped but...
[3:47:54] Shrenko: how many people are in the guild now @MrGattz ?
[3:47:55] TweakT: sounds like jelly to me @mrniceguy817
[3:48:08] Kromede: Noble :O
[3:48:11] MrGattz: 288 @Shrenko
[3:48:26] Puppette: @mrniceguy817 I can't stand playing wow for that reason anymore
[3:48:30] GodKingMuninn: If thats your community and theres no hate or malice in it, then it ceases the moment someone doesn't like it. Thats completely fine.
[3:48:32] schelest_: monkaS
[3:48:35] Shrenko: oh not too bad... tempting to make an NA account just to join you guys @MrGattz :D

[3:48:47] MrGattz: @Shrenko hey ya can if you want to :P

[3:50:08] Clicklesly: It's a prequest for the dungeon i think?
[3:50:09] TheCliffyShow: Escort quest *shudders*
[3:50:10] Pufendorf99: some waves of........Nagas
[3:50:12] Veegore: 5 minutes
[3:50:15] MrGattz: just under infinity
[3:50:49] DrWafflesaurus: do they change druid weapon scaling in TBC? or are they still stat sticks
[3:50:49] tehrobtar: tehrobtar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:50:54] TheCliffyShow: At least je
[3:51:14] Veegore: iirc there's another quest on the beach to collect nage heads, use to combine that with the escort
[3:51:20] TheCliffyShow: At least, he's not one of those NPCs that keep walking while you're fighting things and pulls more thingss.
[3:51:34] MrGattz: and then you ban a word so everyone tries super hard to get around the filter to be cool
[3:51:40] MuttonChopins: druid is fun and fast to level with
[3:51:44] dpbdagger: stat sticks

[3:52:26] VitaQQ: @Towelliee
[3:52:34] rocthenite: @Towelliee also it stilly to single out the an high end raiders, arena, RBG, even classic have done worse shit then dropping the n bomb casraly that is deem toxic
[3:52:43] TheCliffyShow: Guardian wasn't even a thing in TBC from what I remember. It was all shoved into feral. When did they split the two?
[3:52:55] Littlehoodie16: Read that as put  out the Brazzer
[3:52:56] Nottinghams: 🐍

[4:31:25] belfastcl: lets all hope asmongold doesn't decide to start playing on this server
[4:31:29] CritcobainTV: Okay so all of the servers they have right now are AUTOMATICALLY going to TBC. but you can choose to move to a vanilla server for free at the start if you want. OR you can pay to make a copy so you can have one on the vanilla server AND the TBC server

[4:46:27] Nalleys: LUL
[4:46:45] CritcobainTV: world buffs and the RIDICULOUS amount of consumes you have to buy for raid is what made me stop playing classic. I didn't wanna spend like 3 hours a day farming consumes
