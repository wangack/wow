[0:55:58] Wholoveswaffles: Wouldn‚Äôt they have been better off giving a date some stage next year and then actually delivering it before that date, people wouldn‚Äôt go nuts then if it got delayed :D
[0:55:59] Inthezonewow: wouldn't a work around be for them to release pre-patch, because that's technically Dragonflight
[0:56:02] SCARpupGaming: They need to delay it to figure out how to stuff more monetization into it
[0:56:15] Erielle04: And DF is a smaller expansion
[0:56:16] TombStoneMercenary: I am sure most of the devs would want to delay but honestly daddy Blizz/activision is going to want that holiday money.......!
[0:56:17] KutzTV: I truly wonder what it would take for the team to release 1-2 new dungeons ever with major patch.

[1:12:14] Thoreya: copium
[1:12:22] Beet4: Kinda bold of them to announce 2022 release when we only have 6 months left of 2022 and there is no alpha ?!
[1:12:25] net_mi: Blizz is not gonna miss that xmas opportunity , most surely it will be released this year

[1:13:24] Beet4: IF the release in 2022. I would assume November. December is a bad month to release a game
[1:13:26] pealladk: I don't get the "this expansion will be garbage" comments. we haven't even seen the alpha yet
[1:13:28] BfAleTitan: im totally fine with a 12/31 placeholder knowing good and well its march or april 2023 lol

[1:44:11] KAHVITEK: @mavericks312 Yeah, you are probably right.
[1:44:21] mavericks312: DF is essentially a vanilla like xpac
[1:44:23] Galadeon: Gem slots.
[1:44:34] Aidler: problem is that the hugely popular RWF and what the raiders do there has nothing to do with what normal mythic raiders do later on‚Ä¶.
[1:44:40] Naturalbeef: Best thing to do is have a weekly raid nerf
[1:44:52] Kelsillium: @Towelliee instead of players getting borrowed power, as the story progresses, the bosses get progressively weaker (basically making nerfs part of the story).  Or through the story mechanics during the raid unlock allowing a raid team to change encounters
[1:45:02] MrGrimms: oh @Towelliee you ready for obi-wan today?!!? Final episode
[1:45:03] Kelsillium: yeah basically ICC

[1:49:25] trulshehe: stabzmcgeee to not split player base between wrath and retail too much
[1:49:26] ceranac23: next tier undertuned for sure :)
[1:49:31] Wcvechten: Maybe tier gear will get a passive effect that grows stronger in the current raid only, to nerf it overtime?
[1:49:32] SidecarShrimp: @Juerrilla it's incredibly bad
[1:49:40] mavericks312: @stabzmcgeee polish it to the best of there ability there not on a time crunch anymore

[1:50:18] trulshehe: stabzmcgeee No, but i'd imagine the hype is the biggest at launch

[2:00:53] combatant_matt: who needs interrupts!?
[2:01:08] Ithylz: IMO they have time to get something good, even with a shorter alpha/beta. The question is more "Are they willing to listen to feedback compared to others betas?"
[2:01:12] TheRealCaptTrips: Interrupts? What are those? Lmao
[2:01:36] Okri24: Are you not worried it will just be super cookie cutter even with the new talents that you can choose ?
[2:01:40] Wcvechten: I don't think I could live without my interrupts

[2:01:45] cordawg: good
[2:01:47] combatant_matt: it would be smarter to make the talents somehow make the interrupts better, like reducing CD or something
[2:01:51] Yagr6: as a shaman what is gonna be the choice i wonder to give up wind shear.. i cant think of nothing

[2:02:28] TacDuc: I'm going to make the most annoying builds I can make, just so I can make people angry in pvp.
[2:03:16] Kelsillium: Crazy idea for druid tanking, active mitigation option in the form of a resource you can build up and then use to shift to an enhanced cat form with 100% dodge for X seconds based on resources spent.

[2:09:20] Naturalbeef: It moved
[2:09:46] Ithylz: Even with the most DPS-oriented class tree, you'll have interrupt as Feral for instance. Suppose it'll be the same for others
[2:10:04] Mecabeast: wouldn't it just be power now since they're talents
[2:10:05] paradoxyy: defo grind
[2:10:07] JohnnyMustang: @Towelliee do u know if u get the lvl 60 boost with Dragonflight preorder on NA if you can use it on EU character?

[2:10:08] Kelsillium: wait, do you lose the stuff from talents at the end of the expansion?

[2:10:28] therealbrigade: Is it borrowed power of it is now baked into the character? Because it will carry forward.
[2:10:28] at1c: Issues with its being borrowed powers, I wanted the power to stay.

[2:11:17] Mecabeast: I think the losing the power then having to grind back up to get a new borrowed power is bad
[2:11:19] tricky_86: This is not borrowed power, it does not go away it stays. That's the point Towel, it stays.
[2:11:21] at1c: the powers should have stayed and never been borrowed to begin with.

[2:23:07] at1c: Fun seeing people complain about mythic being to hard :P
[2:23:10] Cfuson001: do you think raids should be antorus difficulty? a lot of people did mythic that tier
[2:23:10] Sleepylol93: Long time since i last saw ur streams, very busy irl sadly hope streams still do good and ur ok

[2:23:56] jmitche82: Joined a little late, which mounts are you farming?
[2:23:57] mayonaes: I loved Antorus
[2:23:58] inj0shwetrust: Its a cool raid though
[2:24:03] Ithylz: You can solo KJ now fortunately
[2:24:05] eyeztea: rushing to get online after work to raid and not having 20 man online is the real problem for me. 10man would be soo much better
[2:24:05] Gingerprimer: Also Game was mega popular in lat Legion
[2:24:07] empanadaconpapasfritas: Antorus Mythic is easier to solo than Mythic Kil'Jaeden lol
[2:24:22] Gingerprimer: @jmitche82 doing his mistress attempts in TOMB for the worm thing
[2:24:29] jberry: I am new to this game this xpac can anyone tell me why there are 2 dalarans?
[2:24:30] dyslexican1: I lvoe the concept os SOO, But I do not find it fun to tank it. It shte first raid ina long time that I don't enjoy tanking.
[2:24:39] Metalcalfe: TBH I think the race to world first itself is bad for the game.
[2:24:42] Zorthul_: + in antorus you could do any legos combos, unlike now that 1 must be your covenant one
[2:24:42] Gingerprimer: @empanadaconpapasfritas true you can even kill  him b4 his rp
[2:24:59] Metalcalfe: The need to stop making the game to cater to these world first guilds.
[2:25:22] dyslexican1: sorry SOFO
[2:25:27] inj0shwetrust: I like that this tier was hard
[2:25:36] inj0shwetrust: But it wasnt tuned right for sure
[2:25:43] Anthy1887: I think I'll remember it for the crazy race to world first
[2:25:47] Cfuson001: wait sofo was worse then mythic KJ?
[2:25:49] phewzphewz: why? too hard?
[2:25:55] Sollice: Morning
[2:25:55] Cfuson001: didn't keep up with the new raid that much
[2:26:00] inj0shwetrust: I kinda like the idea of not nerfing it to the ground but maybe give us the ICC style buff as time goes on
[2:26:04] at1c: Unless its worse :D
[2:26:08] mmo_kenna_: It goes back to Asmon's opening day normal raid, people were calling them plebs, git good etc.
[2:26:15] empanadaconpapasfritas: leaked? Pog
[2:26:20] Adeissss: wouldnt they rather overtune content rather than run the risk of having a one day race to world first
[2:26:20] nchester51: but didnt ppl feel dissapointed when wfs kept happenning week 1
[2:26:28] Korupcija_: looked back at 6.2, took my guild 7 months to kill Archimonde world 700ish
[2:26:34] TacDuc: No, I don't really remember The Jailer, he seemed pretty insignificant
[2:26:37] Masqerader: they need to make a raid we can abbrv SoCal
[2:26:40] Bigmann109: Bigmann109 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 11 months
[2:26:56] hunkmg: i think it was tuned really good, just becouse it takes a while to kill doenst mean its overtuned, mythic shouldnt be for everyone
[2:27:05] Oasishydra: Hell no
[2:27:10] inj0shwetrust: No
[2:27:11] Ithylz: Isn't Blizz bad at anticipating that? They didn't take Shards into account in SoD, raid ended up being pretty easy. Here they didn't account the fact that we wouldn't have any "bonuses" compared to top guilds, bosses were thus harder
[2:27:25] Clicklesly: I'd rather see it completed in 6 days than the day of reset ^^
[2:27:35] dyslexican1: Thats a very fair point. No matter how much peoples egos might think none of us are a fraction as good as the top couple professional raid guilds.
[2:27:36] TheTimoBern: i dont care if the people who literally make this their job get it on day 1 or day 5. but making it so crazy for the rest of us is insulting lol
[2:27:38] dormdotz: kind of? top world streamers create hype, the logner they stream the more wow stays relevant in streaming sphere?
[2:27:47] Oasishydra: that's the reason why I quit retail, I had to raid way too much to get raid down. Classic better fit me for that now.
[2:28:02] Korupcija_: 16 hour head start LUL
[2:28:21] Bigmann109: do you think they over tuned on purpose knowing the content was not ready/behind
[2:28:26] zysmos: i think a week is perfectly fine for me
[2:28:37] Reckless_Monk: No way
[2:28:39] mmrghost7: i miss oppulence mythic
[2:28:42] nchester51: aw man splits forgot about those
[2:28:43] Kinghorn: I stopped watching around lords of dread
[2:28:44] Rottencoarse: splits were boring as hell @Towelliee  even for casters
[2:28:45] nchester51: soo awful
[2:28:45] Reckless_Monk: Holandrus and Anduin was EPIC
[2:28:48] Silverwards: a lot of RWF raiders also have day jobs they have to go do
[2:28:53] Korupcija_: I though halondrus was good content
[2:28:58] Silverwards: how many guilds quit because their guys had to go back to work?
[2:29:01] Mecabeast: and your average aotc guild should probably be getting aotc after 8-10 weeks at 2 days/6hrs a week?
[2:29:02] Reckless_Monk: after Anduin.. i didnt care
[2:29:12] Shearkahn: @Towelliee Going to have the retail group finder in Classic WOTLK   im excited  for that one.
[2:29:15] noahtwo_wow: I really liked Castle Nathria :)

[2:29:22] Fugazi811: why would Blizzard care?
[2:29:23] mmo_kenna_: As I RWF viewer I have to disagree it was more content to watch
[2:29:34] dormdotz: I agree, but a lot of people are sheep and see wow high in viewer count and will flock to it
[2:30:44] Odinslayer: Thoughts on the new Group Finder in Wrath of the Lich King Classic? @Towelliee
[2:30:56] Nevindaz: only League
[2:30:56] Cfuson001: league of legends mmo if done right will smash wow
[2:30:57] DirtyBeef2134: You think they'll elaborate on cross-faction in Dragonflight
[2:31:03] jberry: @towelliee can we talk about how dragon flight is $50? Was shadowlands 30????
[2:31:06] Metket: if lost ark bots would watch twitch then they could have a chance to dethrone KEKW
[2:31:33] Matten1950: you guys are delusional if you think wow is no1 on twitch lol
[2:31:37] empanadaconpapasfritas: wasn't that fake?

[2:45:21] Cataclystic: I gotta say though, at least for me. The "Addiction" to wow does not exist anymore. I still really enjoy playing it, because I have a casual guild that will take breaks when tiers are too long - But for whatever reason, when I was playing Wrath I would login just go login, today that isn't the case. Wouldn't be able to tell you why, its just how it is.
[2:45:28] Shearkahn: @Towelliee Blizzard had a release last night that the dungeoun exp is going to be lower because of boosting and that they are increasing experience by 50% until wrath comes out

[2:47:31] thebakeriscomingforu: Having played Wrath at the time it really felt like there was content left on the cutting room floor. Raid ideas never implemented, etc

[2:48:30] Cataclystic: @Nevindaz oh yeeees

[2:51:29] Hypertitan: o they're letting you zoom out more??
[2:51:30] Cataclystic: Why not implement something like the Destiny 2 world first stuff? That would be kinda neat. Put it on tourny realms

[2:54:01] Cataclystic: @Korupcija_ Yea, I guess so. My view of the race to world first is just who has the most money to get BOE's and in more recent cases enough gold to pay other players for tier pieces. Grim overview, but, eh. lol
[2:54:17] Hypertitan: I personally don't understand the thing with killing a boss before nerfs thing.  I just wanna kill the boss.  Is that as big of a thing as people are making it sound?
[2:54:21] mmo_kenna_: wish me luck boys I'm going for RWF LFR
[2:54:32] SaDos: how about not nerf them and let people become better players?
[2:54:39] Blvdman: @Korupcija_ Myself for example, I don't care much for the prestige of Mythic progress, but more for getting the gear from Mythic and getting my character's stats to the way like em
[2:54:42] khrownoes: i mean wouldnt leading edge want to 1 and 1 goal
[2:55:04] TheCheeseWheel87: My goal is to be top 100 shaman on my server, but since in there now, my new goal is top 50 and when i reach that it will be top 25
[2:55:04] Gozzy: just elitism things @Hypertitan 'doesn't count if you didn't do it when it was 'hard'
[2:55:56] Hypertitan: @Gozzy that just seems dumb to me I guess.  you're still beating other guilds to the kill..that in itself is an accomplishment
[2:56:19] Blvdman: not even close

[3:00:09] Gapplebees1: Heroic SOFO was ridiculous

[3:04:22] Cataclystic: I think too many people have a hivemind mindset. So when someone like Max says "wow this tier only lasted 5 days what trash balancing" then the entire viewing audience says the same thing, instead of forming their own opinions.
[3:04:38] Zivs: they already get a heads up of when its getting released so why not
[3:04:40] Blvdman: I actually liked Jailer not having tier. Would have been a bad experience knowing specific slots were locked in due to not being able to kill jailer for probably months on end.

[3:04:40] flebbooo: ^exactly

[3:05:03] Cataclystic: Right. That's my point. haha
[3:05:05] Djfarmville: internet crusaders will care
[3:05:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: they think they are world first quality players Kappa
[3:05:26] Mitune: Ngl Emerald Nightmare difficulty , in hindsight, was kinda the sweet spot imo
[3:05:30] Blvdman: Alternatively, what they should do in the future is the last boss should be able to drop any tier piece, in addition to the regular 5 bosses having their specific tier piece
[3:05:39] Cataclystic: Myself, a casual player, who is 1/11 M to the date, does not care about RTWF dying in 2 days vs 3 weeks.
[3:05:41] rbolude: not even rwf raiders want it to last too long LUL
[3:05:45] CubanGamerz: cuban?
[3:05:45] tempestmemes: @Mitune  bruh no way you for real
[3:05:46] warrenny: @mitune It lasted 3 days
[3:05:52] poklepkin: @cerbrus0 because the end game is about cosmetics and achievements, not about loot and mythic raid content nowadays is made for 1% of a player base (I mean cutting edge)
[3:05:53] NotEnoughMana: absolutely not LUL
[3:05:55] Reckless_Monk: TRUUUUUU
[3:05:59] flebbooo: they don't even do LFR KEKW
[3:06:13] dergNwolf: I think 1 week is the most fun to watch but not really more than that
[3:06:15] CubanGamerz: ke bola asere
[3:06:15] Arch_Pendragon: sounds like it all comes down to not enough bacon...
[3:06:17] rudericus: LUL LUL

[3:06:36] Colt_Engineer: una cervica por favor
[3:06:42] Spacebark: @towelliee Have you considered getting into game design and development? You have many detailed opinions on what works and doesn‚Äôt work. Do you have plans of using your experience to contribute to any games in the future?
[3:06:43] robertcastello: saludos towellie
[3:06:44] weplord: no one truly listens to them
[3:06:45] CubanGamerz: cervecita
[3:06:46] TheCheeseWheel87: I dont know why it matters to most people anyways. half of yall cant get into mythic anyways.
[3:06:51] MrGM: I get all my opinions from YouTubers
[3:07:00] jpoggerr: @Towelliee your by far my favorite streamer man! love these chats

[3:07:18] Colt_Engineer: @MrGM ever heard of a youtuber Mr.GM? pretty decent
[3:07:22] warrenny: Too many ppl are just parrots
[3:07:28] Cerbrus0: @poklepkin i get your point of view but i still think that if you remove the loot from mythic most of the people wouldn't raid at all on mythic
[3:07:41] CubanGamerz: goza la vida y sigue pa alante papi un abrazo desde el 305
[3:08:05] soysos91: shoot, most ppl don't know why they have the talents/spec they have right now; they're just following a guide
[3:08:11] Blvdman: Our guild beat them last expansion, Nyalotha World 2nd, Normal KappaCool
[3:08:12] BrocelotXII: 6 to 20 is the academy to get to the top 5
[3:08:26] Hypertitan: most of those guys are also that good on multiple characters.  I might be a pretty good enhancement shaman but I can't say that for any other classes
[3:08:45] Myrror: we hit 7/11 Mythic last night and we are pretty happy, we aren't the best raid guild in the world hit every CE prior to SL, without these nerfs i don't think we would clear its a pretty tough tier
[3:08:49] Djfarmville: its not really news that wow players will bitch at blizzard whenever they have the opportunity
[3:08:59] Niksen_99: KEKW

[3:09:20] Mecabeast: I think max said alot of recruitment at that level is based on referals
[3:09:32] TeejayOCE: Is hustle a good movie?
[3:09:36] Niksen_99: Echo had analytics behind the scenes on payroll lol calculating everything
[3:09:52] weplord: that's the whole point it's not originally designed for us
[3:10:05] ceranac23: 270
[3:10:08] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  one of the develpoers said that they're not aiming 18 days of rwf XD
[3:10:10] Hypertitan: those guys were raiding 16 hours a day
[3:10:11] itsyoboywill: Hustle is a great movie!
[3:10:12] Rottencoarse: yeah around 270
[3:10:15] Mitune: Either dont balance for RWF at all or just finally Make RWF servers with that insane difficulty
[3:10:16] thunder993: 300ish I think
[3:10:19] Blvdman: 277
[3:10:21] flebbooo: Yeah my guild just hit Anduin last week on mythic and i can def agree these are welcome nerfs
[3:10:22] CanadianCataclysm: so about 1200+ for avg mythic raiders
[3:10:23] warrenny: Hope they jus5 dont go too far in other direction
[3:10:33] poklepkin: @cerbrus0 I don't believe that's true, because when you do cutting edge and the next expansion comes - you don't care about what loot you got from the previous raid, you care about that achievement and tmog you have
[3:10:41] Blvdman: My guild easily looking at like 700 kills
[3:10:45] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also jailer was buggy as hell XD
[3:10:46] Blvdman: 700 attempts*
[3:10:56] duffluv22: How do these guilds know the mechanics before everyone else??? Alphas???

[3:11:17] flebbooo: Imagine the amount of guilds that would break if they didn't nerf
[3:11:18] mavericks312: still ashame what happened to pieces

[3:11:32] Blvdman: what happened to pieces?
[3:11:44] duffluv22: How do they get to test before everyone else??
[3:11:46] warrenny: @rottencoarse buggy or i dint like this buggy?
[3:11:47] Rottencoarse: pieces got disbanded
[3:11:53] chukudu: and they just had joined SK
[3:11:57] Niksen_99: Even classic TBC raids kept getting nerfed guilds were falling apart lol
[3:11:58] Blvdman: oh was there a reason for disbanding?
[3:12:03] mavericks312: i think the next raid tier is huge for aster if they dont perform they could be gone to
[3:12:09] Cerbrus0: @poklepkin once again i get your point, but i think that the highest ilvl should come form the hardest diff
[3:12:09] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:12:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also they got sk gaming as partners just before they announced disbanding

[3:44:04] Blvdman: Even though I know my actions are meaningless in the tsunami of wow players, I try to believe I'm scaring blizzard when I pre-order only 2 days before expansion release. I pretend I'm making them sweat for my money lol

[3:44:31] BlueStripe76: Would be less of a bummer if they gave you a few days of free sub if you hadn't subbed for 3 months or something. Gives you a moment to check the game out again without re-committing financially
[3:44:31] iamspacemanspiff: Funny thing the little Drak pet is taller then gnomes :D
[3:44:32] Divine_Knightt: blizzard is trying to make  as much money as they can before Microsoft take over.

[3:48:21] LeGoogs: @Towelliee Is 2022 really that suprising? we waited 8 months for 9.1 and it was a tiny patch, then Another 8 months for 9.2, there going a .3 patch that recycles content instead of anything new. I see a lot of time they could be putting towards the game.
[3:48:22] Tavoot: it is all about that free play!
[3:48:28] Styrek: lol true

[3:49:33] Tavoot: I thought I was doing good getting $10 in free play from my local casino  LUL

[3:52:02] Pain_Mythyn: It I got into WoW as a new player would I be able to be as strong as everyone else in a few months? I use to play DCUO and they had a skill point system where you have to do tons of hard achievements they give bonus stats which made a huge unfair advantage

[4:25:10] MrFuzzynuts420: I think they‚Äôre gonna release by mid Nov the latest. If you‚Äôll remember when shadowlands released late Nov and they said never again because staff were on Christmas holiday when mythic Nathria released and made tuning harder for them.
[4:25:23] SpenceSir: @kay0234 Aww congrats on the baby! I think December as well
[4:25:26] Bayne77: december isnt a good time for them to lauch either is it, with all the staff off?

[4:55:55] raldrik: Well with it going to the skill tree isnt it no longer borrowed power and now learned power
[4:55:57] HeBeDead: catJAM
[4:55:57] acreal: I think it's pretty hilarious how they made such a big deal about how boring talent trees are and how they lead to situations where you don't get much choice if you want to min/max, so they replaced it with a system that was even worse LUL
[4:56:00] yib_: "going back to the basics" is just the fact that it will stay with us now
[4:56:00] Bayne77: permanently borrowed
[4:56:02] Velashen: @silkeysmooth it‚Äôs not borrowed if it rolls over each expansion.
[4:56:08] mizerboy: @Sollice - emailed to me or in the box when CE arrives? My main thing is to be able to play on launch day
[4:56:08] MTCason: For me the talent tree redux is the most momentous thing we've had in ages.  I value that a lot more than covenants or artifacts or any of the other useless crap we have accumulated over years.
[4:56:08] Masqerader: until its time for alts and the cj memes comes out "aw shit here we go again"

[4:56:35] gxnowayman: I'm not hyped about new exp. I will just play it for sure. Cuz is fun
[4:56:36] callmestray: So is your estimate for alpha sometime in August?
[4:56:41] Velashen: Now we just need a paragon system and housing.. bam haha
[4:56:44] Sollice: @mizerboy I believe it will be in the box. Dont quote me 100% on that. @Towelliee may know. Do you get a code in the box on a physical CE or do they email you a digital code
[4:56:48] HaloS23: @Towelliee time to move to Earthen Ring!!!!
[4:56:49] motorboatingpro: I don't understand the borrowed power thing. The game has had it since the beginning. Tier sets started in the original dungeons.

[4:58:45] thefastestsnail: Can we just have a discussion where the specific power is fun or not? Not get hung up if it‚Äôs borrowed
[4:58:48] mizerboy: @HaxzorJimDuggan  @Sollice  - so if I want to play immediately on launch it feels like I need to buy digital instead of hoping the CE gets to me on time. :(

[5:03:05] Gapplebees1: @Rudric_Ice WoW players don't have girlfriends.
[5:03:09] HeBeDead: no one here has a gf except towelliee
[5:03:21] Sollice: She could not like WoW and you could keep her, but if she hates it, time to go
[5:03:35] altaid47: @gearhead_  we exist :v
[5:03:51] acreal: @AlphasaurusRexx it didn't used to be the case that gear was obsolete so quickly. i think it makes the game worse to balance it that way.
[5:03:54] Gargantix: @HeBeDead my bowser history would disagree
[5:03:59] Gargantix: *browser

[5:04:59] the_bad_goat: wait i mean....
[5:05:10] Gapplebees1: @Asyia3 sounds like a healthy relationship
[5:05:11] acreal: having such huge leaps in player power between patches seems like it would mostly appeal to the hardcore raiders that want something new constantly, and not so much to players that just want to slowly advance their characters
[5:05:26] Sollice: I have her login to Twitch. I shall delete
[5:05:33] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  screenshotted as well
[5:05:37] Rudric_Ice: @the_bad_goat  cool I always loved when two strangers fall in love playing the same game it's hard nowadays

[5:08:21] tronbadgames: @Towelliee do you think all of the abilities are going to be as strong tho?
[5:08:25] Sollice: I would like to try to switch back and get rid of SV
[5:08:28] Gargantix: I only use weak auras for either timers procs or things like a custom combo point bar for energy users, don't use them for mechanics
[5:08:43] dittodittoditto: I really like that they are letting DK 'keep' abomb limb, even if it is a capstone talent
[5:08:46] Sambhur: Anyone know what armor the orc in the pre order picture is wearing?
[5:08:47] maidenhaur: gonna struggle with finding keybinds to many new abilities:(
[5:08:52] acreal: it sucks so hard as a casual player. you come back from a break and the endgame is completely different, all your gear is useless, and you're back to square one.  it's like playing PoE with the constantly shifting meta lol
[5:09:00] Sollice: @dittodittoditto One of the best spell affects ever

[5:09:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the trees are easier to tune in a way, because it's all laid out in one page....opposed to different gear traits
[5:09:52] Gargantix: I really like the multiple choice options for some higher level talents
[5:09:58] Blvdman: I want to see the shaman talent tree, I wonder how badly it will be fucked, as shamans want everything on the tree atl ele does lol
[5:10:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Now the interactions between DF trees and tier sets could get nuts

[5:23:36] toobaked1987: The date is so they could release the pre-orders. Its that simple.
[5:23:38] mavericks312: exactly and ppl are over looking it
[5:23:42] spacecakeul: what bag are you using
[5:23:43] N3llee: give a date range and offer refund of the date is comes and goes
[5:23:47] Gargantix: @Pexaan so multiplayer with replayability and lots of end game?
[5:23:57] daniel85mg: new year eve release party pog
[5:24:07] spacecakeul: Thanks
[5:24:07] adeebo: but that still means that the expansion is coming too early
[5:24:08] PrimalBF: Ain't they legally obligated though to refund if the mark is missed?
[5:24:10] Pexaan: @Gargantix exactly
[5:24:11] st3ts0n98: my wonder is when will S3 end and S4 start? and how short S4 will be
[5:24:24] Austei: dec 25 release lets go LOL
[5:24:25] GamertagTIKI: when do we think season 4 will start?
[5:24:29] Sielu11628: They also said 2022 on their website and a blue post. Not just the preorder description
[5:24:35] Gargantix: @Pexaan doesn't really narrow down the choices haha, I could list a lot of things but you're likely aware of most of them
[5:24:40] toobaked1987: No one is going to refund their order if they push it back 3 months. Blizzard knows this.
[5:24:41] Metket: guys who cares season 4 its a filler
[5:24:45] OGXanos: is that leveling bar a custom thing in ELV or something else?
[5:24:49] Hwilly2o: Hello

[5:25:32] ZeBushMan: getting back into wow is shadowlands worth getting?
[5:25:36] PrimalBF: 4 month filler sounds good
[5:25:39] Gargantix: @Pexaan I started playing WoW again with 9.2.5, before that I was playing Ff14 or GW2, I also play a lot of VR stuff or LoL/TFT
[5:25:44] CyonDru: @ZeBushMan yeah its the perfect time tbh

[5:27:51] qinlae: !alpha
[5:27:51] Myrror: no hearthstone

[5:28:00] ashwing_: thats only on Epic
[5:28:00] mavericks312: basically
[5:28:02] PrimalBF: Pet, but the pet can mount up also
[5:28:05] Myrror: no boost on base either
[5:28:06] Pexaan: @Gargantix do gw2 currently have healthy population? might get back into it
[5:28:07] PrimalBF: Pretty much
[5:28:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: The basic one is basic LUL
[5:28:10] 210Crawler: Pretty much
[5:28:12] Blvdman: the heroic is pretty decent
[5:28:14] Reckless_Monk: be happy they added a pet
[5:28:19] ceetjeeee: what do you get with epic one give ?
[5:28:22] Shirey36: idk the wings they give are pretty shitty too
[5:28:23] Korupcija_: tbf 90$ is good value since month of game time
[5:28:26] Diamondead1: epic one is kinda bad
[5:28:32] Rudric_Ice: didn't base edition use to come with a boost ??
[5:28:35] PadidinJones: you getmogs!

[5:28:46] Reckless_Monk: no
[5:28:46] PrimalBF: I expecting a full transmog though
[5:28:46] Myrror: no boost on base
[5:28:48] captain_cold69: only heroic and up
[5:28:49] dewking93: no just last one
[5:28:52] wraaith: 2 months game time
[5:28:54] GamertagTIKI: you do get the mount on the  69 addition
[5:28:55] Reckless_Monk: heroic and Epic boost
[5:28:56] wraaith: not 1 month
[5:29:05] Roaringkittylol: Heroic is a rip off. You are better off buying the base or the epic edition because the heroic edition doesnt include 30 days game time. You end up legit paying only 5$ more for all the collectors and it gives u game time.
[5:29:05] DUCK__FOOT: Heroic is best value imo
[5:29:06] Reckless_Monk: Epic only has a 1 month sub
[5:29:09] PrimalBF: lol
[5:29:11] TheCakeBadger: Pog
[5:29:14] Diamondead1: i think its 900%
[5:29:16] Rudric_Ice: I think heroic is the best value
[5:29:18] Diamondead1: lets be real
[5:29:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: The base edition only gets the xpack and the pet Drakks
[5:29:19] CardinalTX: LUL
[5:29:24] Shirey36: thats some immortal value right there
[5:29:24] PrimalBF: over 9000 Kappa
[5:29:26] OGXanos: per sent val you
[5:29:33] Metket: buy hc now and buy epic upgrade with half a token 2 years later to get 1 month easy math
[5:29:37] Jinx1348: 300% value (SMH)
[5:29:38] Austei: can we bundle some immortal crests in it too?
[5:29:51] S1appadabass: and since the heroic is 900% value, you might as well get the epic one for 1900% value!
[5:29:54] N3llee: It might be a decent value but still sucks they raised the price. I'm also not a fan of pre ordering anything. So I'll wait a bit and see how things unfold for the xpac.
[5:29:55] deadman385: You get that immortal talk out of here
[5:30:00] WoW_StandalonE: if you buy two then it's 1800% value Pog

[5:30:24] Rudric_Ice: I got the heroic will upgrade it to epic when it's discounted
[5:30:36] NotEnoughMana: fuck his vacation LUL
[5:30:41] emznev: i think this friday and sometime again in july
[5:30:42] HeBeDead: yo fuck this new nodders
[5:30:49] Blvdman: 54.99 CAD for base 89.99 CAD for Heroic. 60 char boost is 75$ CAD, so Heoric seems like a godtier deal
[5:31:03] HeBeDead: 5gigs? aint nothin chief
[5:31:04] PrimalBF: I'm waiting for WoW to have a new paid currency in the game. Only a matter of time.
[5:31:15] phinoxrgp: i got collectors edition
[5:31:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah if you want a boost, the heroic edition is worth the extra 20 bucks

[6:29:41] SilkeySmooth: deifty has 20,000 gold and doesnt even play tbc and buys gdkp runs
[6:29:41] HeBeDead: i mean is it realy that bad? people are willingly paying for stuff
[6:29:45] Samiccus: jeez i remember when BC was retail it was so hard to make gold i grinded for a month to get my flying mount
[6:29:49] Niksen_99: They can stop bots and gold selling
