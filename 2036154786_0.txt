[0:21:37] FutileDiploma: @towelliee how is 10.2.5 any major game play changes?
[0:22:13] Molvonos: @FutileDiploma None so far.  A new side thing, some wrap-up storylines, and collection-stuff, but nothing major.
[0:23:05] FutileDiploma: awesome thanks @molvonos
[0:23:31] DecayedmiNt: Major gameplay changes rarely come in a .5 patch
[0:23:43] DecayedmiNt: They're the filler patches
[0:23:57] Molvonos: Lots of Archeology-based transmog stuff, a new mount, a bunch of pets from what I've seen, Liberation of Gilneas, which has a mount, a transmog set and a hidden glasses-transmog you can fish up.
[0:24:14] Molvonos: And 3 wrap-up storylines/cinematics.

[4:40:12] im_capy: a lot more people play D4 still vs a lot of other game Twitch might make you think are just as busy
[4:40:13] JBonezey: @91Niki its not cool unless you talk down on games.
[4:40:17] notColt45: early on can be rough
[4:40:19] cyrex172: i think they too high on thier horse here

[4:41:00] 91Niki: @MackPlays Unless you have numbers or actively play, I don't think you can legit comment on that ;)
[4:41:04] cyrex172: they tootin thier own horn a lil much
[4:41:09] Theduskflyer: I’m playing each character each season. then I’ll pick my favorite and always play that.
[4:41:23] MackPlays: @91Niki the numbers and statistics are public, its fact not opinion I can comment on what I want
[4:41:32] N3llee: so much content and yet no leaderboards
[4:41:48] Scorpio1401: I've "mained" Necro in both season 1 and 2. I'll probably start with it as well in s3. But I always try out another class or 3 and see what sticks for something outside of Necro playstyle.
[4:42:03] ottavianni: with all the traps necro has a huge advance ,blood mist skill
[4:42:12] cyrex172: @N3llee its dissapointing for sure, was hoping theyd have it by s3 beginning
[4:42:20] Wulfgrym: pretty soon.......
[4:42:20] JoshuaTree6969: "pretty soon"
[4:42:30] Nehcrom: See if I try it out never hit max level yet perhaps this season? :)
[4:42:58] notColt45: If it's 100 stuff it would take awhile for normies anyway
