[1:02:46] Kinghorn: ashenvale was pve
[1:02:47] leben_io: this event is SICK
[1:02:48] mastercowfan: ashevnvale gave more rewards
[1:02:50] shogun2255: @guzu why do you lose blood stacks with death? i thought you dont lose them
[1:02:52] zdh7: we dont talk about the ashvenvale event
[1:02:52] aeons_hunter: STV is PVP, ashen was PVE with ocasionally getting trampled by a raid of 40
[1:02:53] Kinghorn: PVP OR EU????
[1:02:54] mastercowfan: the rep was huge
[1:02:56] CamGG__: no way people think STV was fun om om om
[1:02:57] HelluvaWrecks: only people who dont like stv are pve andies
[1:02:57] sohappy_yeet: stv is literally unfun, unplayable and a not thought out event
[1:03:02] Jokerlelz: This event is the most dogshit event I've ever tried as a warlock OMEGALUL
[1:03:04] bannerwow: Lag ruins the pvp aspect for me

[1:03:42] Cogbolt: would it help to set graphic quality to 1?
[1:03:46] Donnie_ofc: theres mounts and you can farm rep for AB with coins so, there is somethign to do outside of getting your class items
[1:03:47] ohioliving: 15 bucks a month reminder OMEGALUL
[1:03:49] Axelnielsen: might have started lagging if more people reach 40 and starts doing it
[1:03:49] Guzumerchmanager: ye but blizzard servers will always lag at big events @Guzu not sure why they keep making them
[1:03:53] ReconMazihoFanda: @Jokerlelz as a warlock, yeah, try it as a shadow priest or boomkin lol

[1:03:58] Yvernaa: My druid buddy
[1:03:59] brownfiesta: I do think they shoupd have given the vendor more rewards after getting your items, being able to purchase consumables or cosmetics perhaps!

[3:08:15] Guzumerchmanager: @Steafmaster warrior is number 4 overall dmg for gnomer, with more gear they will be 1-2 likely
[3:08:17] resume___: @Guzu Warrior is already topping melee hunters in the 95-99 percentile (I don't think hunters are gonna get any nerfs)
[3:08:21] MrN3xuz: people said warr was weak in P1 too, ended on top
[3:08:26] mlady_telegramz97: wait darkwisp ive seen that guy
[3:08:28] lurkerl0l: Warrior has ALWAYS been gear dependent
[3:08:29] dolesy20: Warrior is on top of parses for most bosses in Gnomer already

[3:08:44] piperboi: Nerf warriors
[3:08:50] saltb0mber: hunter, mage and lock is top parsing not warriors lol
[3:08:51] khufooo: after hunters get nerfed maybe
[3:08:51] Guzumerchmanager: the brown class just got bigger cårks overall it is what it is
[3:08:52] Steafmaster: Warrior is going to be BiS at 60 for sure. It was just a curios question. @Guzu
[3:08:54] danielfoolo: what do you think about rogues?

A Coomer is an expert masturbator. - Example: Joe has spent so many years as a Coomer that his right arm is now freakishly muscular and he cannot think about anything other than his next coom.
