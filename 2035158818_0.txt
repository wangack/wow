[3:16:40] Spottman: Yeah i saw
[3:16:42] Spottman: thats crazy
[3:16:42] ixffyy: for PVE guilds is bubble actualy the worst item that can drop from BQ
[3:16:59] cepsegnever: minSAD minLEE minGASM
[3:17:00] Kreynz: well bauble is completely useless in pve so probably
[3:17:18] notmorbos: @ixffyy yep, even that polearm is 2nd bis for tank druids and decent for feral dps
[3:17:26] hattenhaus: hattenhaus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:17:46] Kreynz: they should just let you buy items like bauble with arena points
[3:17:49] Kreynz: so troll that u can't
[3:18:17] cepsegnever: this is what i've been telling alot lately @Kreynz
[3:18:31] cepsegnever: just sell items for arena points from vendor, only usable in pvp or w/e
[3:18:48] skunkz__: Just buy awp !
[3:18:59] Kreynz: well some items like bauble are completely useless in pve anyway
[3:19:01] Kreynz: it's a pvp item lol
[3:19:41] Kreynz: i mean sunwell dropped items that had resilience on it lol

[3:20:20] meyerr9: you can still use resil toward def cap in wotlk
[3:20:31] hakoosh: will cata be good? ive heard the pvp is alot more balanced than other expansions
[3:20:59] Kreynz: cata is much more balanced than wrath imo
[3:21:08] Deicidiumx: Hot take
[3:21:13] demongodxtv: it was intended to get pvpers to pve since pve was what they wanted people to experience since thats what they spent the most time on right? same reason they brought naxx to wotlk because not many ppl got to see it in vanilla @Minpojke
[3:21:19] UndeadKillerTBC: how is warrior in cata pvp?
[3:21:22] Lardehx: Inb4 double dog will be fotm every season
[3:21:46] codenamegim: big question is what they will do do 2s rewards
[3:21:55] Kreynz: double rogue sounds pretty strong for cata 2s tbh lol
[3:22:00] Kreynz: not sure if people will care for 2s in cata tho
[3:22:20] notmorbos: eh back then it was kinda expected to enjoy the game as a whole. were just used to arcade-y games right now and want to just grind one game mode
[3:22:46] Eotlid: as it should be!
[3:23:28] Kreynz: if you could buy pve gear with arena points that was only usable in arena then that solves it no?
[3:23:52] purgez: 2s is soooo bad in cata its unreal
[3:23:55] purgez: unplayable bracket
[3:24:04] demongodxtv: hasnt pvp always been more active though when there was a bit of both? pretty sure bfa was a success in regards to participation? and they had the pve items with procs that worked in pvp
[3:24:07] xebtko: will they remove title in 2s cata?
[3:24:10] Eotlid: @purgez why?
[3:24:14] Kreynz: 5s is probably a better bracket than 2s in cata lol
