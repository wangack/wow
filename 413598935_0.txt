[1:44:18] Technically_PvP: @blake_tv not really the right place to provide gameplay feedback. Try the wow forums.
[1:44:19] jcpower: NAH i looked at the website
[1:44:43] mezmerized09: @I_DoctorSatan_I I feel for ya, I hope they can figure something out to make fury/arms more viable in higher keys cause youre right they are under-represented

[1:46:27] I_DoctorSatan_I: @ultramad Oh no doubt, it can be, but it's not really providing much subsiance as it was in Legion and WoD tbh. Warriors in BFA is the wrong path Blizzard took them down to.

[1:50:12] klubbfors: People are listening too much from these videos about ‚Äùbest classes‚Äù that only applies to like 0.1% of all players. If you are superior in skill, you probably have better DPS than other people anyway. Only time it matters is really high endgame content which like none of us mortals ever touch

[1:51:43] Doordonot_: Oh look, so many new comps now!
[1:51:47] Antramedes: shakibOOF
[1:51:48] Toon11: gg
[1:51:49] goofybootsz: ah gotya ty
[1:51:49] TydenHc: F

[1:51:52] MeteorPunch: Full Kreygasm Wipe
[1:51:59] Jefferzbrah: gg
[1:52:07] Althandan: ff in 15
[1:52:08] goofybootsz: either way thats sad af when compared
[1:52:08] toxicmedi: ^^ at least we had some aoe in legion and now 45sec cd on a m√§hh aoe
[1:52:10] Warler5: oh boy I wonder what Sunsky can do to come back from this LUL
[1:52:11] echsekuhtor: oh yeah wipe me daddy Kreygasm
[1:52:16] Bade2145: antra FrankerZ
[1:52:18] verZUNGE: frost DK top tier
[1:52:20] Seichti: @klubbfors well, maybe you dont intend to do that, but always just saying "bring the players, not the class" is just idiotic. it's more or less saying "dont think, just play" and will not benefit the potential uprise of newcomers into competive play, but rather disturb it
[1:52:29] Antramedes: @BadeRL PogChamp FrankerZ
[1:52:35] gcscav: @Warler5 bring 3 rogues in match 2 Kappa
[1:52:37] shieldz_cheems: #ACC Kappa
[1:52:43] naifoslim: what a throw
[1:52:44] Sleepypan: all hunters had binding shot which was an aoe stun... its not longer a stun and when it was a stun it required mobs to move be moved to proc it. Bm currently has a single pet stun, MM doesnt use pets and idk about survival
[1:52:45] Dottylou: Sacrifice a gnome and pray for opposing team wipe?
[1:52:45] L1ghtF1re: sloshylushypants he pushed 3500 with dc priest
[1:53:05] ranwulf_maxwell: Interesting, are these chinese team or is just accompany?
[1:53:05] Moobot: Mouse over the inspect tool on your screen to find out what gear and talent the teams are using. Tooltips powered by Wowhead!
[1:53:12] Antramedes: @Sleepypan surv also has intimidation
[1:53:24] echsekuhtor: i cant wait for snunsky's comeback :)
[1:53:25] Antramedes: MM just has bursting shot
[1:53:29] Sleepypan: who plays survival tho Kappa
[1:53:38] deadjosh12: Pog
[1:53:45] Antramedes: exactly Kappa
[1:53:50] Sleepypan: thats a knockback not a stun
[1:53:52] I_DoctorSatan_I: @ultramad I dunno man, I'll most likey start 8.2 with my Fury Warrior, but for now, I'm really liking gearing up my 379 BM Hunter. Already pullling +/-16k DPS in +6 keys.
[1:53:55] Antramedes: nerftankPepeHands MoP survival
[1:53:55] Sleepypan: :P
[1:54:02] ranwulf_maxwell: Why rest druid for healing?
[1:54:04] goofybootsz: well if yout take bursting puls ice thats 2 cc at least
[1:54:06] Antramedes: yeah i know
[1:54:07] Dottylou: It would be cool to see a limitation on class stacking in mdi. Or at least spec stacking.
[1:54:09] goofybootsz: *plus
[1:54:14] Ochronosis: Hes not a trash monster :(
[1:54:16] MrOwlSer: lol
[1:54:18] Ochronosis: just misunderstood
[1:54:20] tsteezyt: disc priest best class
[1:54:26] Sleepypan: with the right traits u can do insane reaping dmg at 379 @I_DoctorSatan_I haha
[1:54:30] Xyronic: nope rope PogChamp
[1:54:31] Dottylou: @ranwulf_maxwell they have excellent dmg, great healing, and the meta tank and dps dont have brez.
[1:54:33] Antramedes: bursting is just a knock which doesnt work on like 2/3 of the casts in dungeons LUL
[1:54:34] brndonkerbit: cuz resto druid has revive
[1:54:34] deimoskiri: if there was 5 of the same class with name that casters couldn't read LUL
[1:54:34] Ultratoasted: @I_DoctorSatan_I honestly, if you enjoy your bm hunter, play it. Don't feel tied to anything and just have fun. If you having fun turns into you playing it more, you'll be better at it.

[1:55:35] shiaki: empty bag plz
[1:55:36] gcscav: I wish blizz would have a good classbalancing team so we wouldn't see a single comp each mdi (no, I do not mean rogue dmg nerfs, but rogue utility nerfs or give every dk spec a massgrip)
[1:55:41] imjoyybtw: B
[1:55:42] Sleepypan: hunters good but u wont be invited to groups because not one of the mdi meta classes @I_DoctorSatan_I XD

[1:55:58] Ragelol: unorganized bags -50
[1:55:58] naraxxius: there are some bm hunters doing verry high keys
[1:56:09] Sleepypan: yes there are
[1:56:12] Toon11: ouch dead
[1:56:13] Sleepypan: bm owns :)
[1:56:14] Antramedes: theres some MM hunters in super high keys too
[1:56:14] Carry_Potter: the pot trade from the camera man PogChamp
[1:56:17] Antramedes: both specs are good
[1:56:21] echsekuhtor: @fearofcode rogue/monk/dk are the only viable dps classes it seems
[1:56:21] I_DoctorSatan_I: @ultramad facts. The reason I'd wanna start 8.2 with Warrior is b/c im already Exhalted wtih all BFA reps and knock out Pathfinder Part II for all toons a bit faster. I believe you need to be Exalted with the 6 BFA and 2 new fations to rx Pathfinder Part II credit for all toons.
[1:56:30] gcscav: @fearofcode it was the same last mdi, every team had almost the same setup, maybe the unholy dk like now for bigger ae damage
[1:56:32] Sleepypan: but the small minded brainless individuals cant break out of meta LUL
[1:56:41] verZUNGE: there will always be a meta comp at the top % of teams, no matter how well classes are balanced, there's always a final best class role when all is said and done
[1:56:46] galinhoo: @gcscav there are like 5 classes never used and you say one of the few that appear as example to buff? LUL
[1:56:50] Sleepypan: @echsekuhtor for this sort of speed run where groups arent allowed many swaps yeh
[1:56:51] gunnar50o1: why does the character 3rd person view change the boss to color blind mode
[1:56:58] streamsniperxXx1337: Ther is a big different between a high key and a fast key.
[1:57:03] Candyfriend: üò° DBM tells me to clear the goo with the golden circle, do these guys not know mechanics LUL
[1:57:06] Mehitak: Lets get back to method eu vs method NA, these last 2 sets of teams have been so 1 sided
[1:57:09] theofficialcynical: !affixes
[1:57:10] Sleepypan: ^
[1:57:14] Ultratoasted: @I_DoctorSatan_I Pathfinder 8.2 is a separate achieve so you should be good to do 8.2 on a separate toon if you've done pathfinder part 1 on your war. SeemsGood
[1:57:24] meechlit: !affi
[1:57:25] meechlit: !aff
[1:57:26] Sleepypan: this isnt meta for pushing higher keys

[2:01:12] I_DoctorSatan_I: @ultramad So, im probally nuking it....so, for instance, my BM Hunter, has PFP1 credit from my Warrior's PFP1 achievement, and just play with my hunter to reach Exhalted with the next 2 factions and it will unlock PFP2...correct?...

[2:01:20] goofybootsz: siege is lame tho
[2:01:23] HpnotiqqGG: @klubbfors its different, alliance horde, thats why its banned
[2:01:28] Sleepypan: @lenowell first MDI was pretty much all druids, 2nd was pretty much all blood dks, this one is all prot warriors
[2:01:30] Ultratoasted: @I_DoctorSatan_I correct!
[2:01:32] galinhoo: @klubbfors banned cause it is diferent for each faction

[2:01:55] I_DoctorSatan_I: @ultramad cool
[2:01:56] Morningst4R: @Sleepypan people always complaining that there is a meta, it only needs to be 1% better to be 100% picked basically
[2:02:09] subliminal187: @ProSwagger no
[2:02:10] Sleepypan: exactly
[2:02:13] SerThunderbeans: @lenowell Indeed, those were the days... Nerf incoming for Thunder Clap come 8.2 though, so there's hope for the global finals I guess?
[2:02:26] Ultratoasted: @ProSwagger No, not until 8.2, so probably June
[2:02:29] galinhoo: rogues are not 1% better tho
[2:02:32] Goggetta: the previous MDI's had a lot more diversity imo
[2:02:37] HpnotiqqGG: when are global finals?
[2:02:51] miracl77585200: NotLikeThis
[2:02:54] Sleepypan: the dungeons didnt require 2 shrouds Kappa
[2:02:56] Candyfriend: pumpsm8tekpog i bet Tek could save this MDI
[2:02:57] JohnT3113: I think last cup, it was Windwalkers, Outlaw Rogues, and Warriors.
[2:02:58] goofybootsz: are there official 8.2 patch notes out? i havent been up on things lately
[2:03:04] Sleepypan: and rogues werent as busted
[2:03:08] lenowell: I just like to see different classes and different quirks for runs etc watching same thing over and over gets boring but thats my opinion
[2:03:21] Doordonot_: global finals will be, warrior, rdruid triple rogue
[2:03:21] Moobot: More info about the MDI Program can be found at the WoW Esports website! https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/mythic
[2:03:22] galinhoo: shrowd + high dmg + true cc + vanish + cheatdeath = balanced
[2:03:22] Sleepypan: ww didnt give physical dmg buff etc
[2:03:30] HpnotiqqGG: rogue is not broken guys
[2:03:34] Keitek: where's naguura?
[2:03:41] I_DoctorSatan_I: Just FYI....if you guys are Engineers in BFA, i HIGHLY recommend you start crafting "Mecha-Bond Imprint Matrix" for Hunters so they can tame Mechanical Beasts. SInce 8.2 will have tons of Mechanical Beasts Hunters will tame. Ur welcome! SeemsGood
[2:03:45] griffa0209: with essences in 8.2 s3 might be a bit more diverse
[2:03:48] SerThunderbeans: 8.2 is currently on the PTR, you can check the notes on wowhead, mmochamp or even the launcher methinks

[2:05:21] falapt: does anyone know which damage meter they use?
[2:05:27] Zorbrix: Details
[2:05:30] Xyronic: any cringers? haHAA
[2:05:38] Candyfriend: In China, they don't say " Motherlode" but instead they call it "Ferocious deplete" and i think thats beautiful
[2:05:43] galinhoo: @calvinmafra cant swap more than 1 class per match, so you are basically locked
[2:05:52] falapt: @Zorbrix thanks :)
[2:05:56] grris: @Xyronic no :)
[2:05:59] Ziphora: ziggyjYikes
[2:06:02] subliminal187: @falapt Details
[2:06:09] Sleepypan: because they are stuck using the rogue for shroud, the druid for brez, the prot warrior because its like having a 4th dps and the monk for the physical dmg buff for the rogues @calvinmafra .. this is teams pushing for the best TIMES. They cant swap more than one class too
[2:06:10] RIP_EU_DENTIST: haHAA /
[2:06:15] Xyronic: @Zorbrix healing meters look good btw, hardly noticed the difference

[2:06:27] SerThunderbeans: rofl, I thought they'd call it "basic workplace"

[2:07:15] Medivh_TheGuardian_: healing meters on 5 man group BrokeBack

[2:08:39] Nigliz: @acheron55 they added a healing meter. which i thionk is interessting to see , how much a heal burst when they pull 4packs with bl
[2:08:40] HpnotiqqGG: so its 1-1 , go next map
[2:08:47] Shaembler: @MisterPeace because the ability is called HEROIC leap...
[2:08:48] Toon11: lol these affixes are crazy
[2:08:49] athalon: @MisterPeace its a joke because the spell is called heroic leap. but he used ti to run away.
[2:08:55] Nephariah: Are they never running Siege of Boralus on MDI?
[2:08:55] Nigliz: maybe its just me
[2:08:57] Sleepypan: @calvinmafra if more swaps were allowed and the engi brez was allowed i would think you would potentially see other comps. But teams will take what they percieve as the best chance to win this.. it doesnt mean it is the only way tho

[5:45:15] Kingslayer1906: LOL casters dont even know the changes - goes a long way to see how BLizz communicates nothing
[5:45:15] Jovrix: they got hit by the bird which knocked them all out of the arena, boss chased them and reset.
[5:45:17] zizoe_: it doesnt do that but if they did i would be right. Thanks xyronic

[5:46:03] Wikedlyrics: @PandaFan686 wait are you claiming DHs don't do much magic damage? Most of their damage is "chaos" which is damage

[5:47:27] ShikaDub: i didn't know their autos did magic
[5:47:35] ShikaDub: still
[5:47:51] ShikaDub: with that there's even a less reason to use DH's in these comps then
[5:47:58] ShikaDub: since they dont' benifit from the monks debuff then
[5:48:11] ShikaDub: and they can't reallyr eplace the monk either
[5:48:19] ShikaDub: else they're now anchoring the gorup

[5:53:47] Wikedlyrics: @Smitherz19 Prot War is used for 2 reasons, 1 is their dps which will be brought in line with the nerf, 2nd is they buff the current meta comp. They might still be the most used tank if it sticks to triple melee comps.

[6:07:20] hollowcrowngaming: there is no balance team
[6:07:22] xxSayden: very heavy drinking game
[6:07:37] Technically_PvP: Considering all teams in the MDI had to prove themselves with time trials, I doubt any of them paid for boosts to get there.
[6:07:38] heppelund: Drink everytime we see this comp
[6:07:39] myamoray: lol

[6:10:29] Nakloh: You are watching this
[6:10:31] Dottylou: @PandaFan686 It's mostly because of the lack of brez in the other current meta, plus resto does more dps than mw.

[6:10:53] ShikaDub: is druid the only healer class with brez
[6:10:53] tommyv_: you are saying there is no point in watching t he stream, whilst saying so.....on the stream HeyGuys
[6:10:57] Wikedlyrics: MW would never fit into current meta since it needs a combat res, but outside of that resto druid is so good because they can do optimal dps while rejuvs are ticking
[6:10:57] Luxbu8: lag ?
[6:11:05] crimxn: @lapine69 It's all about the Benjamins baby
[6:11:21] lapine69: coz i lost myself for a sec here ^^
[6:11:25] Dottylou: Yeah - you can do decent dmg on mw but have to stop healing to do so.
[6:11:37] YannyVideos: are prot warriors the preffered tank now?

[6:11:56] Thregenbeck: i dont think people understand there will be barely any differences no matter how its balanced. even if something is like 1% better it will always be chosen over stuff
[6:11:56] Darkwicky: Chinglish playing?
[6:11:56] Dottylou: Plus stealth + shadowmeld makes for awesome skip safety.
[6:11:58] Rostan: @YannyVideos yes
