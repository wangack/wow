[2:54:45] harmless52: i do agree with jb, but it's still funny to mock him lol
[2:55:05] Nuublet: we did raal on fort 28 without our healer when he DC, they literally dont do anything i think
[2:55:13] FareweII_: @AkilliesX IT's a 23, it should be possible by a top team with no healer, it's more of a class design thing
[2:55:13] Zimmerh: NAs last hope pog
[2:55:13] Satimy: @yumytv do people have access to the legendary weapoon
