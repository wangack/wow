[2:33:17] LeeBazzaH: Ive been playing counter-strike since 2002 , Seeing someone get caught is very satisfying
[2:33:19] UNSUNG_HER0: yes bc their entire "career" is over
[2:33:29] Fullthrotle: @Swifty  if you are talking about multiplayer games, which you are, yes super satisfying
[2:33:35] nitzy2: exactly
[2:33:36] TakesCake: shameless plug for ***

[2:33:50] Hulx: Yes
[2:33:51] tiberioxid: but on exams it is okay
[2:33:54] kalokinn: you should watch the counter-strike pro player "forsaken" get caught live on a tournament
[2:34:04] nua2: IN multiplayer hate i think is the correct word to use
[2:34:15] diegok: forsaken LUL
[2:34:18] ubio: true, but you'll get caught eventually
[2:34:19] lewtnscoot: @Swifty Do you feel like stream sniping is considered cheating?
[2:34:22] UNSUNG_HER0: ive seen quite a few live vac bans lol...they are epic
[2:34:25] nitzy2: people who cant play legit and have to cheat should stick to singple player games where they cant ruin the game for others.
[2:34:27] Fefefar: Im A total wow-noob. But what is happening here now? Is this what BGs are about? It seems so OFF? No need to focus?

[2:36:39] mike4pres: I remember when the honor grind was in tarren mill 🤦🏽♂️
[2:36:55] HasbullasBro: swifty how much do u think a fresh R14 account would sell for
[2:37:09] snigglez: you will still get it if you are in the same bracket tier as him
[2:37:19] smokingwins: @MildridTV Nothing, worthless, Only worth it to the person who got it
[2:37:22] tiberioxid: is the top game wide or server only? if that makes sense
[2:37:23] HasbullasBro: just curious
[2:37:27] toemaytoez: ban for sure KEKW
[2:37:29] HasbullasBro: not intending you will sell it
[2:37:34] PermaGrinnn: sell for nothing now, easy ranking in som compared to previous
[2:37:36] UNSUNG_HER0: they ban the account but you get paid lol
[2:37:57] HasbullasBro: permagrin said this grind is easy.. LOL out of his mind
[2:38:01] smokingwins: Why would it be worth anything? You only get a tiny benefit from gear before SoM is over. its worth legit nothing
[2:38:07] reaVaen: The grind is real.
[2:38:19] Salazar_Storm: @swifty how long ago did you hit r13?

[2:38:57] PermaGrinnn: as in original version and classic
[2:39:00] kaserious: and for how many months is the rank 14 gear top ?
[2:39:08] HasbullasBro: not everyone has the will power or discipline to grind to R14
[2:39:15] xoof: Hold on, only 1 new character can get r14 per week per entire server ?
[2:39:42] PermaGrinnn: and ranking isnt "hard", just time consuming
[2:40:07] HasbullasBro: @PermaGrinnn thats the hard part

[2:41:00] nitzy2: yea we had a guildie quit the game at rank13 during BWL phase cuz he was getting cyberbullied by the premade pvp team on the server cuz he was kicking their bootays without being in a premade group he was doing 22h/day powernapping in AV queue and they all tried to get him banned he gave up because he was getting ill irl from exhaustion

[4:38:53] Blaccus: you grind so hard
[4:39:02] TheEndIsNear777: I think retail's main design was to keep people playing for the longest time possible, milk every sub for as many months as they can. Thus their content is always very grindy and takes long time
[4:39:04] davisonxxd: @Fullthrotle i would agree it is fun but its too long
[4:39:18] MortalasTV: torghast ofcourse isnt what they said it would be either.
[4:39:26] signoflifettv: @Swifty are you playing classic or reg wow

[4:43:22] Ascendor81: Layering is fine, just put your party ont he same layer
[4:43:56] NitNo: EZ 20
[4:44:04] Patoued: I think the 20$ was if u wanted to clone and ur character be both on clasic and tbcc

[5:59:35] bulljr3: wait until the market crashes and all these people have these over priced houses and can' sell
[5:59:39] haypl08: Government stimulus measures giving everyone disposable income and driving up the prices of all things. Once the government turns the tap off it'll be a shock to the economy
[5:59:41] ironforge_1337: i was gonna call bluff... lol

[6:01:14] ironforge_1337: ammo prices are still high too but that's normal when a gun grabber is in office

[6:02:02] olssonzz: inflation is going crazy
[6:02:09] richypc: def some fake inflation some of it legit
[6:02:09] ironforge_1337: i bought a $75k car a few months ago, put 3,500 miles on it, then traded it in for $76k lol
[6:02:11] bigmeanie: i think theyre using the "chip shortage" now as a way to artificially inflate prices.
[6:02:14] Link9286: global chip shortage, i dont know all the info
[6:02:34] haypl08: The house prices went ballistic here in Australia too, certain blue collar suburbs in cities like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, house prices went up 40% and 50% within 1 year. Unfortunately Australia has Capital Gains Tax which takes a majority of a persons financial gain in taxes if they chose to sell it and capitalise on the price increase
[6:02:36] icbjames: it's not so bad now, but a year ago there were dealerships with like 4 cars total to sell lol.
[6:02:41] Fullthrotle: it affected the area where they are made. so people couldnt go into work and make them
[6:02:46] Fullthrotle: prices then increased
[6:02:49] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[6:03:01] HazyWings: remember when that volcano erupted and sound cards went up 1500%
[6:03:13] Nokkternal: I am still waiting to get a RTX card
[6:03:26] Lacrimosa96: Food prices are currently ridiculous too
[6:03:29] jim__art_: shortage of money in their bank account lol
[6:03:44] bkkarma: got one:)
[6:03:53] Hanscakestealer: theres a hotpocket shortage as well
[6:03:54] bigmeanie: these artificial shortages will keep going i think until people just stop buying things lol.
[6:04:00] Not_From_Oz: @tenthbull Isn't that the truth!!
[6:04:09] Fullthrotle: There is a shortage of specific chips that are used in many things. So yes, shortage in cars, cards and other things. Which then will have the prices increased by the people who sell them.
[6:04:10] Link9286: there a shortage of brain cells, thats why this chat is 3Head
[6:04:11] bigmeanie: when dealerships arent selling cars. those inflated prices will come right down
[6:04:17] toxicsalami: But thats how economy works, more scarcity = ppl willing to pay more
[6:04:43] ironforge_1337: yea exactly.... now is a great time to trade in a USED car and get a NEW car
[6:05:02] SpoonManes: abusing the fundamentals of supply and demand to turn a quick buck

[6:07:07] AnitaGrnKard: Since it's part of the political strata then no it doesn't matter
[6:07:08] Fareld: If you were to grind R14 again with another class than shaman or warrior, which one would it be?
[6:07:12] Lacrimosa96: the best car advice: never buy a Nissan
[6:07:33] olssonzz: @avenomxx Making the stock holders happy.
[6:07:40] Link9286: im a Tacoma fanboy
[6:07:53] ironforge_1337: @Fareld 100% he would say shaman..... he's having so much success with it
[6:07:54] bigmeanie: yea ive heard Nissans arent the best anymore. which is a shame. Nissans in the 80s and 90s were stout and reliable.
[6:07:57] SpoonManes: go with the general and save cash now!
[6:07:58] Lacrimosa96: Tacoma is a great truck
[6:07:59] AnitaGrnKard: I mean every car is a piece of junk, just depends how much it costs you

[6:09:14] bigmeanie: I own a WRX, paid 27,500 off the showroom floor, in March 2020, right before the Covid shutdowns. The dealership i bought it from has sent me email offers for 30k for it, 2 years later. Lol
[6:09:16] Crystalforge: no car payment would be nice lol

[6:11:29] Nokkternal: You can sell almost anything at increased prices right now its insane
[6:11:30] darkend92: its because the chip shortage and they can turn around and flip it for 10k more. so you make the 3k extra but there gonna turn around and flip it for another 7k proff
[6:11:38] ky_ull: Carmax offered me 5k more than I paid brand new for my car... in the same boat except im thinking bout down trading and banking the $$
