[2:06:09] 91Niki: @mrpresbaby Lightyear is the movie that played in Andy's universe that made him buy the toy. Tons of Captain America toys are not voiced by Chris Evans either ;)
[2:06:16] Sollice: Well I guess Chris Evans was the real Buzz Lightyear and Tim Allen played the toy version of it
[2:06:54] 91Niki: Trust me, Chris was as much on the fence to voice Lightyear. But after the Director explained it, it made sense
[2:07:01] Boostedmk6: negative ghost rider

[5:50:20] Aidler: @erosnpsyche and with more then 20k concurrent viewers back then he certainly got a lot of pressure from people around him to get a sub button
[5:50:23] 1Beal: I think the problem is that the modern gaming market is normalizing getting away from getting a full experience with a single money payment. Now it's either a buggy mess or they're constantly trying to get into your wallet.

[5:53:21] GunpowderPete: i am going to confess. i dont play wow, i dont think this game is worth 15$ a month
[5:53:31] belfastcl: maybe they have something left back from when it was titan
[5:53:32] mavericks312: i think the price point for the pve will make or break OW 2
