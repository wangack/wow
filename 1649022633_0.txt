[0:47:14] Thomusus: they can even freeze the enemy in time for 5 seconds, say at 10%, so you can 100% guarentee the kill
[0:47:27] Slaynt42: Yooooo a new sponsor? <3 PogChamp PogChamp
[0:47:46] Wablestomp2: is this retail?
[0:48:01] Thomusus: they debuff the enemy at 10%, he gets healed to full, but it doesn't matter, after 5 seconds he's back at 10% :D Evokers will be STRONG
[0:48:30] FishiBoii: Baaaaaayblade
[0:48:41] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://go.corsair.com/LP9zBa
[0:49:37] Thomusus: Dragon DPS yea he will be able to 100% secure a kill for you as PROT
[0:49:47] Thomusus: and you can protect him from melee damage, they struggle with that
[0:49:55] Thomusus: Evoker DPS + Prot War could be real strong
[0:50:38] Thomusus: Yeha because if you EVER get them LOW, he can debuff them at 10%, they get healed to full, then after 5 seconds due to his debuff they return to 10% = Execute
