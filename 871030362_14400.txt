[4:07:39] ManzanaComunista: but the spread has to be perfect xd
[4:07:39] Turbopumper: it's a bit risky but ppl can /range 10 and just make sure they're far from others

[4:36:44] VoylRL: Kissahomie
[4:36:45] trexizking8: i respect final fantsasy but its to over the place and cringe af
[4:36:46] genejitsu: the only thing i dont like about wow gameplay (destruction of the lore aside), is the clunky ui, the amount of keybinds that require you to own a razr naga to pvp and the fact that raid strats are already revealed before they are released.
[4:36:47] SteveChin: ez kill
[4:36:49] Dracksar: @shroud do you play resto for nax

[4:36:56] Pyroytic: and then there is weaving so you almost never have nothign to do
[4:36:56] worms8six: it's a 2.5 second gcd but most of the classes don't get off GCD abilities until after level 50
[4:36:56] denialz1: damn 15k viewers, but atleast you play what u want

[5:51:54] spinalinfinite: there is a different oil for healing Pepega
[5:51:56] TesservcT: the tooptip is wrong my dude.
[5:51:56] Lookatzack: the Tooltip for brillant wizard oil is the same as the 30sp enchant. They both increasing damage and healing.
[5:51:58] TheNivel: I think chat comes from Wotlk or later expansion. Classic had divided spell power and healing. Its THAT simple
[5:51:58] Regndoft: IT WORKS OKAY IT'S COUNTER-INTUITIVE BUT IT WORKS yo
[5:51:58] stickyf1ngaz: there it is doooood

[5:52:07] garthorama11: i honestly thought that sp effects healing
[5:52:08] turamb: he must be trolling
[5:52:08] Jimbagg: I don't know who's right or wrong :)
[5:52:09] PetraGG: It does. that's why all the healers use it instead because it's better for the extra +healing and the crit rather than mp5
[5:52:09] extracredix: hpally = flash of light - the most efficient spell in classic wow
[5:52:09] jopovt: chat knows best ;)
[5:52:10] sleazy_maniac: shroud isn' t playing pala

[5:52:17] Wild_on_bud: u were calling us dumb
[5:52:19] Mentalstatemike: it works with priests not shamans
[5:52:19] Lookatzack: SP translates to healing, but healing doesnt translate to damage.
[5:52:22] sirfabius2: mp5 is better for long fights yeah
[5:52:23] BCanSam: @shroud the ONLY arguement for pallies is the crit, since their crits give mana back
[5:52:25] azraei7: !stream

[5:52:35] Slapsstick: everyone is talking about paladins for what reason? pallys are different than shammies believe it or not KEKW
[5:52:35] Or1nn: @shroud paladins work on crit, for free casts thats why they use it
[5:52:35] Regndoft: @Mentalstatemike wrong
[5:52:36] Priestzor: world buff ez 1 shot
[5:52:39] paus3_: VoHiYo VoHiYo

[5:53:07] Lookatzack: Yeah... its classic and the tooltips, are intended bugs lol
[5:53:07] impxdlol: DUDE SPELL POWER GOES TO HEALING
[5:53:07] MercinScorpio: mp5 = mana per 5 seconds

[5:53:13] KingRamseys: @shroud on that one specific item, it actually works for healing as well.
[5:53:14] mattisthegreat: @Moo360 no it doesn't ...

[5:53:17] NipsSC: lol yes its supposed to
[5:53:18] jaypiffgang: sp does go to healing
[5:53:21] TrigzyPvP: @shroud JUST TEST IT BRO - have a priest put a HoT on you, which heals for EXACTLY the same amount each tick, and then have him add the oil and see if that healing is increased - it does.
[5:53:21] jaypiffgang: wtf
[5:53:23] stickyf1ngaz: spell power affects healing too
[5:53:29] SuggShow: this from 2007 @shroud Brilliant Wizard Oil offers a sexy double-whammy bonus to both spell damage and spell critical strike rating, and the spell damage affects healing as well

[6:04:58] TesservcT: you should atleast make a mouseover for LHW and CH
[6:05:01] ggd88: in Europe sure
[6:05:01] bitola_unk: Its a control fight. You need to work on getting your push past 40% to happen just after an MC

[6:05:26] Nuux_: @cerz207 They are changing the pic of the emote every day or something now. They talked about it on twitter.
[6:05:29] SteveSD: we have our raid spam frost potions
[6:05:34] SteveSD: seems not alot of your raid is
[6:05:39] notnatelol: is this a good game I've been considering getting it
[6:05:42] toxicapb: Okay, i got all information.
[6:05:44] saibot93tv: @shroud i just joined - ur raid should use 110+ frostresi and pop protectionpotion on cd
[6:05:44] SymbioteLasher: PogChamp
[6:05:45] doraemonfan1: does shroud use a diff mouse for wow?
[6:05:48] treckstar_: Ya we also spam frost pots
[6:05:50] bitola_unk: yeah DPS popping FrR pots helps
[6:05:51] habalion: @notnatelol do it
[6:05:51] Mitmoc: they arent using FR and arent using frost pots, result as seen

[6:06:05] Solenoidx: 1st time nax?
[6:06:05] adapt145: @Clyrom8 yea I though so cuz im playing on private server and we must unequip weapons before MD
[6:06:07] bitola_unk: You dont really need +FrR gear
[6:06:08] KyleBWoW: Gotta do better on threat gen after an MC. Dps needs to chill so that tanks can regain threat. Its all about control with KT you can't go all out DPS and expect to down KT
[6:06:09] SymbioteLasher: WeirdChamp
[6:06:11] deftimez: yea seems like people are getting smashed by the frostbolts
