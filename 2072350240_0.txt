[4:03:44] realgypso: @robbtuck ah gotcha
[4:03:54] helloiamlucas: its always like that lol
[4:03:56] TheEndIsNear777: servers from 2005 :(

[4:04:03] sabanalol1: Dud stop with this insane gameplay rn, uhg, I can't even rn 😎🤙
[4:04:06] KingQueenAce: they changed the layering
[4:04:07] wavecadet: its been this bad the last couple days
[4:04:08] wHaCkEdTV: it only started lagging yesterday for me
[4:04:09] wavecadet: they did something
[4:04:15] einself111: They reduced layers
[4:04:15] wookieenthal: ;)
[4:04:18] Peoplewhinetoomuch: They removed some layers
[4:04:18] andypandynz: less layers?
[4:04:25] dontbecold: Worse the closer to the boss you are
[4:04:34] Robbtuck: @realgypso you trust everything the government tells you? lol yikes
[4:04:37] wavecadet: They changed how layers force ppl
[4:04:40] ph252: fewer
[4:04:41] TheEndIsNear777: They need to upgrade their 2005 servers to 2024 servers that can handle 200 vs 200 even if it takes them 1 month to move the old ones out and new ones in :)
[4:04:42] wavecadet: so it lets layers get super full
[4:04:44] wavecadet: before forcing ppl off
[4:04:47] andypandynz: surely blizz has statsfor how many people they canhandle in zone??
[4:05:02] wavecadet: BEACH KEKL rip
[4:05:14] lizcat_: Craig PogU
[4:05:15] garzist: is stv a good time
[4:05:33] andypandynz: 5 man skirmishes is good
[4:05:36] sarahuckabee: @TheEndIsNear777 believe it or not, the issue is their new server tech
[4:05:52] TheEndIsNear777: @sarahuckabee D:
[4:06:35] thatquidproquo: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[4:06:35] Maruika: its the gdkp scanning AI that is lagging stv
[4:06:36] TheEndIsNear777: @sarahuckabee i was hoping the upgrading was easier :(
[4:06:52] dorminion297: Hey @StaysafeTV ! You suck!
[4:07:03] mysteriousm4n: hurry up staysafe PogO
[4:07:11] summerteeth: SigmaArrive
[4:07:21] DankWizard420: is stv still laggy? Susge
[4:07:32] Farenheight451: the beach respawn is the worst
[4:07:48] aleck1776: Thats a big boi
[4:07:55] PhokingTV_: the ghost
[4:07:57] DankWizard420: not done it in a few days now when you couldnt layer with your party KEKW
[4:07:57] PhokingTV_: is top right
[4:07:58] sydale: sstvPls
[4:08:00] PhokingTV_: of the ruins
[4:08:08] noshot_bucko: sstvPls
[4:08:18] troutmaster23: lolll
[4:08:24] sarahuckabee: @TheEndIsNear777 it's unfortunately a layer capacity/distribution issue. some layers are lag free while others are swamped
[4:08:31] summerteeth: LUL
[4:08:35] DankWizard420: veela sstvPls
[4:08:38] PhokingTV_: worst spot he patrols
[4:08:39] Iggy1221: LUL

[4:08:43] wavecadet: they all move now
[4:08:44] MaavR6: they move around now
[4:08:44] dontbecold: They move Pog
[4:08:45] MonzonWasTaken: ICANT SO BAD

[4:08:48] DankWizard420: KEKW
[4:08:58] PhokingTV_: its in the arena KEKW
[4:09:02] madabber_: some move now
[4:09:07] Eran_: Yeah no its actually at the altar now :)
[4:09:09] TheEndIsNear777: @sarahuckabee oh i see
[4:09:09] summerteeth: KEKW great event
[4:09:14] DankWizard420: wait they actually move
[4:09:27] PhokingTV_: the beach is the worst spawn
[4:09:28] Tinman_VF: THIS IS WHY ITS LAGGY all the ghosts re moving changing spawn points
[4:09:28] DankWizard420: it's never enough time KEKW
[4:09:32] PhokingTV_: the rest of the spawns are ok
[4:09:32] wramel: that's what blizz does best lol
[4:09:35] PhokingTV_: the beach is legit the worst
[4:09:44] DankWizard420: KEKBye
[4:09:50] summerteeth: Deadge

[4:09:54] andypandynz: weekend gaming LUL

[4:10:00] DankWizard420: rogues YEP
[4:10:08] PhokingTV_: they need to remove beach
[4:10:12] lethalkingr: guys enh shaman melee hunter or sp for PvP and pve?
[4:10:29] PhokingTV_: spriest
[4:10:43] Robbtuck: they’ve been changing stuff so often so I say play what you want
[4:10:53] BenThel: 2 bood stacks Pog
[4:11:13] lethalkingr: hmm
[4:11:22] orangemaple24: every time i do it that how it is
[4:11:23] PhokingTV_: beach spawn = skip event
[4:11:23] trebolzthethird: Yo @StaysafeTV
[4:11:24] 14forever: !song
[4:11:25] Nightbot: [Underworld Band] - Curse of Agony
[4:11:26] lethalkingr: I think I I’ll try sp
[4:11:34] helloiamlucas: i think this is the experience a lot of people have
[4:11:35] Baemare: it’s beach spawn
[4:11:37] obstata: ive only had it not lag 1 time
[4:11:37] cjadude: its not been fun for the last week
[4:11:43] trebolzthethird: Sadge
[4:11:46] trebolzthethird: banned
[4:11:47] obstata: this is the norm in my exp
[4:11:48] Mawshaw: @trebolzthethird Susge
[4:11:49] TheEndIsNear777: the lag totally ruins for me :(
[4:11:53] lizcat_: @trebolzthethird seq1
[4:11:55] DankWizard420: I still need to get the shaman totem but the thought of stv makes me sick Sadge
[4:12:00] TheEndIsNear777: i stopped lvling at 16 ret paladin :( thought about lag
[4:12:19] PhokingTV_: wheres ur healers
[4:12:39] sweetleaf_: yeah when its laggy its complete shit
[4:12:58] PhokingTV_: beach spawn = skip event save mental
[4:13:10] wavecadet: They had it great then broke it
[4:13:21] wavecadet: The beach spawn is also the worst by far
[4:13:23] Robbtuck: I didn’t even know the beach was a thing tbh
[4:13:25] sarahuckabee: their layer distribution function is fucked
[4:13:29] lizcat_: they just can’t leave well enough alone
[4:13:29] shalomski: There was a post about it, its all about what layer your on
[4:13:49] thatquidproquo: not bad on layer 6
[4:13:56] PhokingTV_: if ur in the first 3 layers
[4:13:59] PhokingTV_: good fucking luck
[4:14:00] PhokingTV_: KEKW
[4:14:06] dontbecold: Peggers Farm Mobs
[4:14:15] me_patrick: Each layer probably has their own cloud instance. Performance can vary between instances.
[4:14:16] diadel__: just leave bro this aint worth
[4:14:24] diadel__: back to uldaman
[4:14:25] wookieenthal: fun times
[4:14:59] cjadude: lol
[4:15:00] summerteeth: it's awful
[4:15:03] andyjamesgames: yo Trump is live at CPAC and everyone is there. Ramaswamay, Mike Lindell, Seb Gorka, Lou Dobbs, bro the whole fucking gang. @StaysafeTV
[4:15:08] Iggy1221: got my ring and cloak in stv, then I was done with it, no way im going back
[4:15:23] grevis165: he zoomin
[4:15:36] paulthecat: is it insane lag again?
[4:15:39] Tinman_VF: people will identify a meta zone though and stack it
[4:15:42] Wingsofjanitor: Clueless surely splitting the population will have no negative consequences
[4:15:43] andypandynz: idk if they have enough players
[4:15:50] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV what should i do with my bloodmoon coins now?  im exalted with AB, Rank 5, and have both mounts.
[4:15:52] realgypso: @phokingtv_ oh shit brings me back to 2019 I remember you, you play on thunder fury?
[4:16:05] PhokingTV_: ye yes...
[4:16:07] reefo: my server lucky to have 20 ppl at stv
[4:16:09] Robbtuck: this mix is so good
[4:16:10] PreferablyBaked: PepoSabers
[4:16:16] Mawshaw: I think if you could choose 1 of the 3 people would find a meta and funnel one zone regardless
[4:16:19] Ariosity: @Wingsofjanitor you have no clue what you are talking about
[4:16:19] tsetse2fly: @paulthecat so they decided to have less layers so the world was more populated, and that way STV event became unplayable again
[4:16:20] ImGravycakes: behind you and by bank
[4:16:29] realgypso: XEROMERCY LOL
[4:16:36] paulthecat: @tsetse2fly BRO BUT IT WAS SO NICE
[4:16:55] cyonara74: i just got here, wtf happened?
[4:17:03] andypandynz: imagine choosing to condense layers on a friday before the weekend LUL test it on a monday
[4:17:06] PhokingTV_: yeah i stay off the first 3 layers during prime time
[4:17:15] PhokingTV_: it makes a huge difference
[4:17:17] paulthecat: THE EVENT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL MAN
[4:17:20] hinaborn: having a PTR is better than "discovering" shit imo
[4:17:21] leroylol: blizzard refuses to upgrade their servers
[4:17:28] linkitcraig: @PhokingTV_ yeah we joined a group very early and probably on a fucked layer
[4:17:29] cyonara74: There was some lag the other day on Wild Growth too
[4:17:30] JamesIRL: i log off every time
[4:17:35] troutmaster23: layers like 7-9 are pretty good
[4:17:39] PhokingTV_: james Pog
[4:17:40] summerteeth: i agree, the lag kills it
[4:17:57] JamesIRL: @PhokingTV_ yoooo
[4:18:07] helloiamlucas: @phokingtv_  can you force yourself off a layer without another player inviting you?
[4:18:09] cyonara74: time to @aggrend on twitter
[4:18:21] PhokingTV_: not that i know of @helloiamlucas
[4:18:22] NemeZzz: what is in uldaman?
[4:18:28] PhokingTV_: i just have the guild post if theyre in a high layer
[4:18:32] PhokingTV_: and layer off 30 mins prio to STV
[4:18:40] helloiamlucas: gotcha, thanks
[4:18:41] PhokingTV_: we make a huge 40 man raid group then split off
[4:18:45] PhokingTV_: so everyones on the good layer
[4:18:53] tsetse2fly: @paulthecat Agree, I think they have to like have dynamic time layering or something. What I mean is expand on layers every 3 hours to fit the STV event, then shrink after STV event is over.
[4:19:13] dave3ooo: why is he still posting from his fucking personal account
[4:19:18] andypandynz: bro aggrend is acting like wow isnt out forover 20 years
[4:19:18] dave3ooo: bruh
[4:19:20] andypandynz: what aclown
[4:19:21] summerteeth: ICANT
[4:19:24] MonzonWasTaken: clowns ICANT
[4:19:25] crouder: they have no clue lol
[4:19:26] sweetleaf_: They are so lost OMEGALUL
[4:19:27] DOD__TV: Clueless
[4:19:31] rraksut: l
[4:19:32] Krawnixx: Krawnixx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! So Based
[4:19:40] andypandynz: im glad people are seeing how dumb aggrend really is
[4:19:41] 14forever: is it on all servers?
[4:19:55] B_P_Richfield: nerfing hunters will surely fix the lag :D
[4:20:04] PhokingTV_: but yeah if u wanna nerd out have someone make a 40 man raid in stv on high layers 45 mins prio to event
[4:20:05] reefo: now we kno why it's laggy lol
[4:20:07] PhokingTV_: then u split into groups of 5
[4:20:38] earl_z_mode: yea im literally never doing all that
[4:20:40] DOD__TV: they should just watch people's streams
[4:20:40] summerteeth: not good
[4:20:42] reefo: they want time stamp yup
[4:20:42] andypandynz: if anyone reads this and thinks yea ill sendfeedback needs to uninstall the game
[4:20:47] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I wonder if they can make extra layers just during STV event time, and then shrink them again? Why couldn't they do that?
[4:20:52] noChance219: sstvNPC
[4:20:55] PhokingTV_: not for nothing but theirs work arounds for all of this.
[4:21:00] crouder: Why am i supposed to to free Dev work?
[4:21:00] Maruika: whyy is george flyod trending
[4:21:00] Eran_: u need this sort of detailed info to diagnose it
[4:21:05] earl_z_mode: you guys figure it out lol ur on payroll, why am i doing the troubleshooting for blizz employees? moniter it
[4:21:06] PhokingTV_: u can do shit to mitigate this
[4:21:11] reefo: everyone invites to layer1
[4:21:12] PhokingTV_: but the game should just not be lagging
[4:21:16] andypandynz: @Eran_ games 20years old this was fixed in retail years ago
[4:21:22] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV But it wasn't a problem just a few days ago?
[4:21:22] JamesIRL: I was okay with dead IF and playable STV
[4:21:23] wiild1: i think every layer feels bad
[4:21:26] cyonara74: if i had a choice, i would go to lower pop layers for stv
[4:21:29] obstata: i just went from 1 to 8. no lag on 8
[4:21:32] Eran_: layers tho? thats added onto the game
[4:21:35] PhokingTV_: u fish for highlayers
[4:21:37] reaper2204: they need to restructure the servers and stop the layer bullshit
[4:21:40] wavecadet: force groups to layer off
[4:21:43] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: games dead already, like i said before, the genre is swamped and blizzard ruined this game when buying out PVT servers and creating their own.  WoW is finally ending due to it's own wound.
[4:21:45] earl_z_mode: you just defer it so the person inviting goes to the smaller layer, ez
[4:21:47] caltex88: Need to just phase full groups off
[4:21:51] Marshammer: make layer selectable by the group leader somhow
[4:21:52] m00n4nds74r: in gw2 they have layer caps and dont allow you to layer into the instance
[4:22:00] PhokingTV_: but even if u cant get into that group
[4:22:03] PhokingTV_: he could just relog
[4:22:06] PhokingTV_: to force the layering
[4:22:09] andypandynz: wow playesr have beenconditioned to be the bug fixers and sort out problems for blizzard LUL
[4:22:19] PhokingTV_: if u relog it resets ur timer and forces u on the layer of ur group
[4:22:22] Marshammer: if they make layers selectable it will fix it
[4:22:29] caltex88: If inviting a 5th person hits cap need to just phase the full group off
[4:22:36] PhokingTV_: no way in hell they make layers selectable KEKW
[4:22:37] JohnWick_QQ: next time to improve this event: make it PUG style, u start at a zep (on zep all are immune) then u jump off the zep with a parachute where u can change direction and once u hit the ground ur not immune anymore,  ju
[4:22:59] noshot_bucko: 🫃 🫃
[4:22:59] PhokingTV_: ^? KEKW
[4:23:02] andypandynz: @JohnWick_QQ their budget is aggrends salary
[4:23:14] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I don't get how just like 2-3 days ago this wasn't an issue at all and then it suddenly became laggy again like early in phase 2 STV?
[4:23:22] PhokingTV_: just let us queue into the BG
[4:23:23] PhokingTV_: W
[4:23:24] Rebukenx: yes, except me
[4:23:26] NutterCircus: It sounds like they have no idea as well.
[4:23:33] naughtiemares: Staysafe \o
[4:23:43] klecho123: @kobbi12345 like
[4:23:48] Eran_: it is what it is, I hear they dont have a huge resources so ppl that feel like helping them out a little may do so
[4:24:03] naughtiemares: Just went thrifting and got a bunch of stuff
[4:24:04] reefo: i am a server architect, they have a good system but hardware is limited and when it reaches capacity you have to expand which is what layers do, the problem is players are inviting to the packed layers and everyone stacks a few and overloads it
[4:24:06] Chainluck: Is that Uldaman good gph?
[4:24:10] naughtiemares: Damn you doing ulda?
[4:24:10] PhokingTV_: RIOT MMO WHEN?
[4:24:19] wookieenthal: COPIUM
[4:24:19] NutterCircus: So we know just as much as they do EleGiggle
[4:24:26] Eran_: it looks like they are doing their best
[4:24:28] me_patrick: These systems on the back-end are INCREDIBLY complicated.
[4:24:30] naughtiemares: Thats not bad
[4:24:54] PhokingTV_: we need a starlink dedicated server
[4:24:54] Luthoo: WHEN IT REGSITAHS
[4:24:56] PhokingTV_: W
[4:24:56] cheetobbob: gw2?
[4:24:57] andypandynz: runescape has the same problem look at tourneys
[4:24:57] kheap_: maybe they should combine the servers like classic era
[4:24:58] paulthecat: new world hardly lagged
[4:25:00] reaper2204: runescape servers are superior
[4:25:02] Qworalmarker: That Amazon mmo
[4:25:03] PhokingTV_: ELON MUSK COULD SOLVE THIS ISSUE!
[4:25:03] MonzonWasTaken: so cap servers YEP
[4:25:04] hinaborn: retail wow seems to not have that hard of a time
[4:25:06] Qworalmarker: New world
[4:25:09] klecho123: server = bottleneck
[4:25:10] lambda__function: runescapes solution is to have the game run on a tick system, with 0.6s ticks
[4:25:17] reefo: @MonzonWasTaken servers are capped
[4:25:21] SepeIio: Remember spamming to get into w2 back in the day to trade
[4:25:27] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV There was an mmo recently that don't have the problems at all, some new japanese or korean game, forgot the name.
[4:25:28] carbonzo_bean: @hinaborn need players for that unfortunately
[4:25:36] Argatand: how are u in badlands and I see ur body in stv KEKW @StaysafeTV
[4:25:40] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: warcraft is on it's way out
[4:25:41] Argatand: layers are s fucked
[4:25:46] andypandynz: yes i would love to stand in a spot swapping between worlds for ore
[4:25:46] MonzonWasTaken: @reefo are they tho? cause crusader strike na said full but i could still make a character
[4:25:56] TaddiMason: osrs is always the answer
[4:25:56] Eran_: @tsetse2fly does it have players tho?
[4:25:57] cheetobbob: what about gw2
[4:26:02] PhokingTV_: great source
[4:26:05] PhokingTV_: fucking idiot KEKW
[4:26:06] wookieenthal: wildstar LUL
[4:26:09] klecho123: ah yes the koreans
[4:26:11] normageqq: should let you select layer like runescape
[4:26:12] dave3ooo: i mean if no one's playing the game
[4:26:13] Robbtuck: when the servers are actually full they are labeled as locked
[4:26:13] dave3ooo: then
[4:26:15] dave3ooo: yeah
[4:26:16] carlos_dang3r: Asian culture LUL
[4:26:19] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I hoped someone in chat would fill me in lol
[4:26:22] PhokingTV_: hey i got the answer to your quesiton i just forgot it KEKW
[4:26:23] caltex88: Vanilla wow servers were capped super low, like 3000 people online
[4:26:23] lizcat_: KEKW
[4:26:24] reefo: @MonzonWasTaken yes, they are. full on the list doesn't mean completelly full. they won't allow you to make a char on truly full server, it will be blocked
[4:26:31] tsetse2fly: no people are playing
[4:26:35] Rebukenx: every system scales if you have 0 users
[4:26:39] klecho123: lost ark
[4:26:40] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: @tsetse2fly Doesn't* have problems at all. Some new japanese or korean game, forgot the name. Learn grammar
[4:26:41] tsetse2fly: I head sonii talk about it
[4:26:45] NippleResident: the koreans would fix it buy making you pay to get in kek
[4:26:49] PhokingTV_: LOST ARK W
[4:27:03] PhokingTV_: lost ark had the best gameplay of any game ever to bad its a P2w SHIT FEST
[4:27:06] reefo: and really only capacity is online players, it doesn't matter if 100k sign up for a server if only 1k play
[4:27:10] overkillz666: but in runescape the worlds are all treated as a specific thing to do like there are world for just questng some are  for prayer training

[4:37:16] m00n4nds74r: the bots are rampant, the devs only care about the cash shop, and the community cries about everything in the game, and you still have the toxicity from min maxxers

[4:44:44] Denat0: i dunno he's funny when he's actually pvping @andypandynz but i don't want to watch someone level really...i prefer even watching end game dungeon grind over leveling
[4:44:45] apacheD: I thought you liked shootin'? OpieOP
[4:44:48] andypandynz: wow streamers clutching at fotm LUL
[4:44:49] ghostbagster: @andypandynz why are u so angry

[4:45:01] KerriKaoz: we gotta show more compasion

[4:45:17] klecho123: man cant wait for some HC updates
[4:45:19] xidion32: Phase 2 has a bit of a lack of interesting content
[4:45:22] m00n4nds74r: he logged on like once phase 2 then went back to GTARP
[4:45:23] apacheD: SoD2 too hardcore Pog
[4:45:33] mibbiix: It's lacking content
[4:45:38] mibbiix: Hardcore > SoD
[4:45:40] arcantio123: its weird tho i feel like as a player i have more to do in phase 2
[4:45:42] NutterCircus: Streamers that do not do any community participation seem to be struggling.
[4:45:46] TheEndIsNear777: Esfand got crusader strike nerfed from 4 sec to 6 sec because "it makes paladins 'spammy' and not in like with class lore" peepoSad
[4:45:53] TheEndIsNear777: then he left :(
[4:46:04] klecho123: rolling a lock ssf?

[4:46:44] apacheD: I want to see you struggles, while I eat boorgers KKona
[4:46:46] klecho123: i liked it more with the addon/ssf to be honest than the release
[4:46:49] tsetse2fly: Wasn't that always the truth?
[4:46:51] PhokingTV_: to play hardcore and not be a content creator is crazzzy
[4:46:52] HammerFaust__: @TheEndIsNear777 they just made it from wrath crusader strike to tbc crusader strike, in sod beta CS also triggered seals so its just that kind of change.
[4:46:52] ghostbagster: @andypandynz ok peace bro

[5:02:03] sweetleaf_: Not all men have good hairlines either pepeLaugh
[5:02:06] kishkutv: @MacEleven Thats the spirit. But i'm sure you'll find one eventually

[5:52:34] Crikeyyy: fuckin quakers
[5:52:36] armega4432: Its a pagan holiday with name changes and adjustments so it was easier for those converting
[5:52:37] plaidshorts: religins does instill good morals for the most part
[5:52:49] DuoX: the founding fathers idea of freedom of religion was be whatever version of protestant christian you want to be lol
[5:52:57] sigilfish: Its like bloods and crips
[5:52:59] numblezzz: except the part about the constitution saying the government is secular
[5:53:01] MacEleven: catho-lick my balls
[5:53:02] DINGODOGGERDUDE: stop nick is gonna get pissssed
[5:53:04] dreadd39: @kickbetter34 my fellow retards. not the degenerate hellbound
[5:53:06] lukersz: christian gang wars be crazy in ireland
[5:53:07] DuoX: we have to go back
[5:53:08] WeeNeeber: Funking business wanted the cheap Catholic workers the first mistake
[5:53:13] gamewatcher024: There's a video on YouTube about since Christians had adopted or announced that Christmas was related to Christianity they also created the retail kind of splurge that everybody does and it's out of control massive problems
[5:53:19] chasingshadowsz: Catholics need to calm their tits
[5:53:21] JWicks13: yeah i think they should be able to teach religion in public schools if they are teaching Queer Theory and CRT.  But thats just me
[5:53:37] unscconnor2: our current president identifies as catholic
[5:53:44] dreadd39: @kickbetter34 o7
[5:53:46] numblezzz: im not aware of history that catholics couldnt vote
[5:53:49] CrushadinWow: How do you find things to do on SoD?
[5:53:53] MacEleven: my old boss is a freenasib
[5:53:54] DuoX: who were controlled by the illuminati
[5:53:57] MacEleven: freemason*
[5:53:59] Pimplejewce: arent freemasons just cloaked jews
[5:54:06] sweetleaf_: @Pimplejewce no
[5:54:16] NutterCircus: The catholic religion is largely responsible for education through out the world in the beginning.
[5:54:23] Seoken1: they might take the popes orders!
[5:54:25] Seoken1: hah
[5:54:29] chasingshadowsz: Catholic Priests touchy touchy lil kids
[5:54:37] klecho123: are protestants the retail version of classic christianity
[5:54:43] dtl78: when did the war against the protestant reformation end
[5:54:50] kishkutv: Does anyone know what happend to Kungen? He was streaming non stop for 6 months and suddently dissapeared
[5:55:04] gamewatcher024: What if all the touchy touchy newsworthy that we have in reference to the Catholics is biased because of the who's reporting it
[5:55:10] Crikeyyy: thats what he does
[5:55:16] sigilfish: @kishkutv he does that, he only streams when mentally well
[5:55:17] jimg3: i thought protistants originated from Henry VIII with church of england
[5:55:24] poorboy55: you gold farming?
[5:55:27] klecho123: we started talking religion and god cursed us
[5:55:30] arcantio123: i wonder how much anglicans there were after the american revolution or if they mostly left. similar concern
[5:55:46] Dezmachinne: what is your build?
[5:55:47] Plathyy: or by a rabbi
[5:55:53] Ropy123: @chasingshadowsz LUL
[5:55:54] numblezzz: @jimg3 nah, henry just jumped on to protestant movement and made his own non catholic church
[5:55:57] NutterCircus: They dont want to talk about that.
[5:55:58] pottifar11: @jimg3 its kind of related/similar, but not the same
[5:55:58] wuanluciano4: where tf did u hear that
[5:55:59] BlownFuse_: all i need to make my tailor helm is heavy silken thread and im so broke i cant buy them lmao
[5:56:03] DuoX: new york tunnels
[5:56:05] echoloch: or if you leave your kids at a day care
[5:56:06] gamewatcher024: No but if you go to the federal website for Job searches you'll find out that they're hiring young looking girls women to catch these people in the school
[5:56:14] chasingshadowsz: There are alot more teachers thats why
[5:56:17] darthterac: NAMBLA
[5:56:19] cjadude: @DuoX was just about to mention that LUL
[5:56:26] pizzadad212: now it’s smash melee streamers
[5:56:31] numblezzz: the catholic church tried to bury it
[5:56:32] chasingshadowsz: not if
[5:56:34] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Pedos go anywhere kids are left alone with trusted ppl
[5:56:36] sigilfish: Can we get that on per capita monkaHmm
[5:56:47] NutterCircus: It is always interesting to investigate which professions attract pedos
[5:56:54] Crikeyyy: KEKW
[5:56:55] nastiku: valid attack
[5:56:59] chasingshadowsz: disagree
[5:57:00] numblezzz: if the catholic church didnt try to hide it and move the pedos around to different churches, it would be different
[5:57:02] numblezzz: that was evil
[5:57:04] tsetse2fly: @kishkutv He has bipolar disorder, You get really ecstatic over weeks, then depressed for weeks/months then "normal" periods. So maybe he had a "high" and then now "low" tough to speculate tho.
[5:57:08] MyOpiate: wish they would look at Hollywood, and the evil there
[5:57:10] lukersz: it being an "easy" shot is already bad
[5:57:11] sigilfish: Catholic also have been covering it up since 1950s, its easy to make new story about that
[5:57:15] iBanEvader: @NutterCircus it's easy to guess...
[5:57:20] Endeby: some real irony when people in video game communities talk about catholic priests
[5:57:20] klecho123: @NutterCircus kid entertainment unfortunately, nothing to do with religion
[5:57:22] chasingshadowsz: they were scretenized cause they were....priests
[5:57:28] nastiku: easy and good,
[5:57:34] arcantio123: i think catholics were affected by it a lot too and were talking about it. that's intense betrayal
[5:57:41] Lava_in_a_Lamp: I disagree on "it's only an attack on christianity". There are known pedos in the vatican that would be in prison in the US
[5:57:42] iBanEvader: I had some weird teachers during my school years @StaysafeTV
[5:57:52] berno100: cause teachers are hot
[5:57:52] klecho123: psyop
[5:57:57] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Why indeed Susge
[5:58:00] Crikeyyy: how many kids interact with catholic priests vs teachers
[5:58:01] nastiku: because everyone assumes priests and rabbis have inherent ethics and morals
[5:58:01] chasingshadowsz: well there are more teachers
[5:58:04] stankypanky22: maybe its not the % but the amount of occurances
[5:58:05] nastiku: BU THEY DONT
[5:58:11] AverWill: It's all God's will right?
[5:58:11] AmarokUnchained: monkaHmm or the Rainbowpirates?
[5:58:13] numblezzz: schools dont try to hide and protect pedos, unlike the catholic church
[5:58:15] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV they don't wanna scare people from letting their children go to school
[5:58:26] dtl78: christians arent the same as catholics. its all just shame rituals anyway
[5:58:27] iBanEvader: that's why they don't talk that much about it
[5:58:32] chasingshadowsz: yes
[5:58:38] iBanEvader: meanwhile the politicians/media hate the church
[5:58:52] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV are you concerned about your kids going to public school in the PNW?
[5:58:59] blozham: only 13% of catholics priests
[5:59:00] mowi1007: @iBanEvader That is just so untrue.
[5:59:09] spoornoo95: guys what is good gold per hour at the moment? 20?
[5:59:13] lizcat_: they’re bad everywhere
[5:59:15] sigilfish: Have you seen Oregon schools KEKL
[5:59:25] plaidshorts: Homeschool your kids!!!!
[5:59:25] iBanEvader: @mowi1007 I'm mostly talking from northwestern EU standpoint
[5:59:27] chasingshadowsz: i cant debate with you cause you will probally ban me...its your stream
[5:59:33] dtl78: ive never heard anything about pastors or a reverend only priests which are different
[5:59:36] lizcat_: @plaidshorts BASEDCIGAR I do
[5:59:40] lukersz: shit parents into shit kids into shit teachers
[5:59:41] iBanEvader: @kickbetter34 @mowi1007 might be way different in NA
[5:59:47] plaidshorts: i do as well
[5:59:59] gamewatcher024: Headache?
[5:59:59] rendmoore: SOD worth playing? if so warlock vs pally for dps
[6:00:02] dreadd39: @chasingshadowsz he doesnt mind opposing opinions here, only when you get obnoxious and annoying about stuff
[6:00:06] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Did you go to public school all your childhood or did you have periods of homeschooling also?
[6:00:11] iBanEvader: @chasingshadowsz you can debate him, this is not an asmongold stream
[6:00:28] chasingshadowsz: @dreadd39 i totally disagree i have seen him ban people for lesser reasons
[6:00:35] nebunu88: warlock is very fun
[6:00:39] rendmoore: sweet thank you for the info :)

[6:03:24] FeverxDream_: how many vosses can you solo in there?
[6:03:26] Iggy1221: Incinerate is pointless vs demonic pact? on legs ofc
