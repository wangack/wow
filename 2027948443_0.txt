[1:45:39] CoraDeVine: Random question for mods; do ya'll get paid?
[1:45:48] itzzbearded: True! ads are a must.
[1:46:23] Brandishblade: I just go out of my way to not buy the brandsd that advertise on twitch.
[1:46:44] Metrii: A lot of it is just greed at the top level too.

[1:46:51] Metrii: Within any industry
[1:47:34] itzzbearded: Its a trickle down.
[1:47:49] Maledictt: Ads arent evil inherently but its how they are wielded. Prerolls and forced ads without the streamer's control are a detriment to the experience.
[1:47:53] eldritchcoffee: such a goofy looking boss
[1:48:56] Effin_Steffin: worst legs since Ragnaros
[1:49:25] Molvonos: Considering the alternative, people seem to forget that regular TV has 30 minute shows, where 20 minutes of them are ads.
[1:50:05] itzzbearded: Or just sub, whether that is sub to streamer or get nitro. Twitch has given multiple options to opt out of the ads.
[1:50:07] cyrex172: no legs but hes abo to kick all ur asses
[1:50:15] Brandishblade: I get the necessity tho, just mute and minimize when im not subbed
[1:50:17] Maledictt: Im on the older side of TV and I have not seen a 10 minutre duration show
[1:51:17] Molvonos: It progressively got worse.  30 minute shows with 10 minutes of ads, then 15.  I used to watch a lot of TV when I was younger.  It was less noticable when the shows were hour-longs.
[1:51:21] JComp: JComp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[1:51:43] Molvonos: One of the main reasons I stopped watching TV around when I was age 15, because I got tired of that nonsense.
[1:51:53] Brandishblade: Its the worst for sports. especially the nfl and ncaa
[1:51:56] Molvonos: So 2-3 minutes of ads on Twitch isn't shit
[1:52:45] Molvonos: And Twitch is actively trying new ways of non-invasive advertising, or perhaps they always had it and I didn't notice, but One streamer had a border advertisement pop up.  No sound, nothing disruptive.
[1:53:24] Maledictt: For me the twitch ads became untenable with prerolls (I havent even watched anything yet) and while towelie said they have control I have had some that felt like they occur in the heat of the action
[1:54:06] ArbyWan: Prerolls drive me batty
[1:55:18] Effin_Steffin: Little Arms Dragon form, Little Legs Visage. checks out
[1:55:28] Prism_Gavin: I hate when you ask a question and then instantly get hit with an ad as they start to answer
[1:55:49] rymerre: they should be scared...before turbo if someone had ads when i first clicked it immediately hit the X
[1:55:51] MoonwalkingAngel: twitch is a bussiness just like any other company even if it is just entertainmant sad ppl lost there jobs

[1:56:31] Noshpan: @Molvonos I've always suggested a picture-in-picture style of ads, that can appear at the top of the chat window like polls & hype things appear. Except place the ad in the pnp square with no sound
[1:57:05] Maledictt: The opposite is more likely the ad takes the screen and the streamer is in the corner
[1:57:05] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:57:37] Noshpan: At least they fixed the ads that broke the player. That was annoying to get stuck with hour long political ads, only to find that the ad crashed the player & you have to reload again... which caused you to have to watch another ad.
[1:57:48] Prism_Gavin: I think that happens currently? Or that may just be better ttv or something I have

[1:57:52] Molvonos: 'They should be scared', like Streamers shouldn't make money, at all.  Like Twitch, a business, shouldn't make money, at all.  What an absolutely ignorant way to think.
[1:57:55] Brandishblade: i mean ngl if i click on a stream and get bombarded right off the bat i just click out to go somewhere else
[1:58:00] Noshpan: @Maledictt I've only seen that happen once on Twitch.
[1:58:00] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[1:58:50] Noshpan: @Brandishblade I will tolerate a pre-roll ad when I first go into a channel if it's of a streamer I follow.
[1:59:58] Maledictt: My issue with prerolls is I am trying to find a stream doing something interesting. I havent even watched anything yet to queue up an ad
[2:00:39] Noshpan: I do miss how ads were done about a decade ago.
[2:02:10] PapaPing1: @Towelliee  Wow you guys have come a long way since I saw you guys on this last week
[2:02:28] arnagegaming: are ya doing it in mythic?
[2:02:33] Noshpan: Yeah, can't avoid pre-rolls
[2:02:39] PapaPing1: Very smooth phases there
[2:02:39] Masqerader: when ads drop, i get up and get a drink or something
[2:02:55] Masqerader: or just get turbo
[2:02:59] Maledictt: Shouldn't avoid them.. you can but it disables all ads
[2:03:23] MoonwalkingAngel: i dont mind adds just not every 15 or 30min every hour 3min adds i dont mind
[2:03:42] Noshpan: Twitch was recommending to another streamer I watch to play 8 minutes worth of ads. And the streamer was like "Fuck no. I love my viewers. I'm going to stick to playing 3 minutes."
[2:04:50] Maledictt: Its all timing for me in league LCS matches during a critical teamfight it kicked to an ad I was furious. Not sure if its something they can pay or opt for to have control or not
