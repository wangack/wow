[4:28:57] GodkingDoggo: Frost mage is fine, especially if your group won't pull around CDs. Fire is so CD dependent
[4:29:03] Sickfiend: Can we not talk in chat unless you're high IO (1400 EU, 2800 NA)

[4:29:15] Eploar: @Thomas_Huayra In MDI it would actually be pretty insane. There are consistently large pulls which means BoS would have time to shine.
[4:29:35] theofromjojo: OMG Krisix is sooo good wtf

[4:30:29] xxlorthxx: @thor_r yep
[4:30:34] Thomas_Huayra: @Thomas_Huayra Well then why has there never been a key higher than 24 done on Frost DK then? BoS is so dependant on your RP generation that it meshes terribly with doing mechanics.
[4:30:34] Toadlette: @kuroz naguuraFlower

[4:31:13] Thomas_Huayra: @PaperCodes Or just fix Frost. Bad as it is, it's also by far the mose fun DK spec.

[4:32:18] Dav3Schneider: @Thomas_Huayra no, frost DK is actually fine. Just UDK is better in certain dungeons.
[4:32:20] Cereal_Killa: @babyninjajezus u dont have to kill the 2 mini bosses
[4:32:21] kryptikk666: they can only fix frost by completely removing or reworking BoS, it's been bogging down spec design since it's introduction
[4:32:30] Kieron_RS: They have a ranged ability
[4:32:31] What_ln_Tarnation: @DadBodGamerGuy thats true, i do get offended whenever they use it in pvp
[4:32:38] babyninjajezus: @TCGRebel those mobs are normally tied to the boss?

[6:59:54] myfans4141: well my wife is eternal
[6:59:56] Supernewbb: @reformedgala after 8 hotstreak pyroblasts, they get  a buff which requires you to hard cast a pyroblast to gain combustion for a short period of time
[6:59:57] brothadawkness: It’s over for reset

[7:29:01] adamantium_bear: no hunters in mdi even though they have a crazy bow monkahmm
[7:29:18] NexiiTV: they cant survive
[7:29:24] skottsaker: @adamantium_bear hunter doesn't help with staying alive lmoa

[7:31:38] Daieon: @NexiiTV Like, hunters have both of those now lol
[7:31:38] reformedgala: @meady If you give hunters warlock survivability levels, you have to take something else from them. There is no giving without taking.
[7:31:50] adamantium_bear: @NexiiTV survival of the fittest and then they have an hp increase thing, but ya, they're squishy I agree. I'm just saying they have a cool bow and they dont get usage in big boi keys or mdi
