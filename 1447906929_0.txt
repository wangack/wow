[1:00:55] Keyastaron_: and the lego isnt 100%
[1:01:04] Keyastaron_: i did it once on halls didnt fall
[1:01:07] FrankTizzle: Assuming you get 1 per boss, you need to kill 20 normal bosses to get 1 heroic upgrade or 20 heroic bosses to get 1 mythic upgrade
[1:01:08] Zavier420: Corridor Creeper mount?
[1:01:09] Thoreya: @FrankTizzle thats sick
[1:01:10] FrankTizzle: BrokeBack

[1:03:58] SecondV: I was at 29 renown when I started, doing the secrets and chains stories got me to 80 :x
[1:03:59] PvtHudson093: If chat didnt know, Prime gaming has a mount to be claimed for Lost Ark
[1:04:02] toyhutt: Damn T, 9 x 30 sec ads for non-subs.  I let me sub cancel as I took a Twitch break.  That's a LOT of ads for non-subs brother< LOL
[1:04:12] Keyastaron_: well for the raid ones just go to Zereth theres a NPC there
[1:04:17] mavericks312: the pain in the ass ones were from torghast
[1:04:18] primej_24: Omg
[1:04:34] FrankTizzle: @toyhutt just how the sausage is made; it's going to get worse
[1:05:19] cryft: i dont like guaranteed legos, just feels like a talent point that's super hard to allocate
[1:05:20] toyhutt: @FrankTizzle I agree, but it seems a bit excessive compared to other streams.
[1:05:21] mavericks312: i think its possible they scale back on leggos in dragongflight
[1:05:21] pereadin: IIRC my first legendary in legion took around 150 M+ dungeons to get and it was the worst one PepeHands KEKW
[1:05:22] Keyastaron_: i miss the AP grind fr is i had my computer at the start of legion id be grining all dfay everydfay

[1:05:28] hikaritd: That was the best. Now you just pick one lego and get it, super boooring
[1:05:40] youbylon: Did you know 10.0 was going to be about dragons? @towelliee
[1:05:49] TheCliffyShow: I liked when there was only a handful of legendaries and they were hard to obtain.

[1:06:44] hawkergiant: i thought that chest was a once per character deal
[1:06:46] Rexialiton: @hanshehexd shut up KEKW

[1:11:55] TexasSpades: Tier drop is ass cheeks
[1:11:55] MayroVision: I guess, as a viewer. I don’t understand what’s new with the new patch.
[1:11:56] natevic: they increased the drop rate with this reset
[1:11:58] cerealkillas22: i find alting still annoying af in shadowlands
[1:12:07] Zeke_nl: they buffed the drop rate on keys
[1:12:16] SecondV: I must have terrible luck or terrible timing I still need 8 more rares to unlock flying :/
[1:12:23] cerealkillas22: Like its better then what it was, but i personally just cant find the motivation / enjoyment with alting in shadowlands with all the bs you gotta do
[1:13:27] ContraRob: I love how short the "chores" are in Zereth Mortis
[1:14:07] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  you gonna get the 278 conduits soon?
[1:14:20] pronkk_: cypher gear should be boa
[1:14:39] Keyastaron_: accountwide cypher system , unity and conduits
[1:14:41] snake_like: m+ upgrade being account wide could be huge
[1:14:42] RacerDuke: I dunno if you've ever tried the World Quest Tab addon, it integrates into the Blizz UI almost seamlessly but doesn't have the puzzle solving stuff. It's really nice though
[1:14:52] mavericks312: yea upgrading to heroic an mythic level gear
[1:15:03] Keyastaron_: cath up to 60 LUL
[1:15:09] bypized: @Towelliee who has better reception GW2 new expac or BDO new update?
[1:15:11] Keyastaron_: MOSTLY EVERYONE IS 80

[1:15:24] Keyastaron_: EVERYONE GRINDED EVERY COVENANT
[1:15:27] Keyastaron_: Kappa
[1:15:42] Clicklesly: I mean, we saw yesterday you can basically do 15s with 10 renown and no gear Kappa
[1:15:42] Gurtogg: why wait for 9.2.5 for that
[1:15:48] Keyastaron_: 100% POG
[1:15:56] hawkergiant: renown takes like no time at all right now
[1:15:58] Gurtogg: they could just hotfix that in now
[1:16:00] Keyastaron_: @Gurtogg  POG
[1:16:12] Tigris002: Good question
[1:16:14] CrusaderNero: cause we gotta wait months for it. thats how blizz does it
[1:16:17] MetalJoshP: True
[1:16:19] soysos91: that makes too much sense
[1:16:22] devslewa: True
[1:16:22] faulen: it's basically that now
[1:16:27] CrusaderNero: yeah that would make sense
[1:16:28] Man_A_Fold: its for the people that jump back in for the nex xpac hype
[1:16:30] MrFuzzynuts420: blizz loves their timegating
[1:16:32] Jimstur: is that not their MO? Always doing things too late?
[1:16:34] CrusaderNero: so better not do it Kappa
[1:16:37] faulen: other than the 40 vs. 60 change
[1:16:38] bypized: @Towelliee who has better reception GW2 new expac or BDO new update?
[1:16:38] MetalJoshP: That’s too logical lol
[1:16:39] Saltydog76: who isnt 80 now ?? really
[1:16:45] Gurtogg: @Towelliee you can upgrade normal items to heroic and heroic to mythic in 9.2.5
[1:16:56] szble: stop making sense towellie
[1:17:00] Keyastaron_: @Saltydog76  i am but ive grinded on other toons
[1:17:18] CrusaderNero: is there even a reason to lvl renown to 80
[1:17:25] Saltydog76: @keyastaron_ true but for mains
[1:17:46] Nico_vdM: I dont think the heroic and mythic upgrade tokens is for current content but rather for season 4 older raid tiers
[1:17:55] Keyastaron_: yea im 80 on my DH but night fae and for hunter 80 Night fae
[1:18:41] Thoreya: this is a good change
[1:19:17] Jimstur: are we supposed to create set gear now btw? if so  where do we do it?
[1:19:36] ArcaneSyntax: people still play BDO?

[1:21:21] Thunder1127: Why all the adds
[1:21:21] Clicklesly: Including the warr? Kappa
[1:21:26] boopbopbamski: LUL
[1:21:40] pavepawns: i just realised that the creation catalyst might be another way to get mythic mogs for m+ players
[1:21:42] SiXKiNG_: did you watch Peacemaker?
[1:21:47] hawkergiant: AND HIS NAME IS
[1:21:50] ArcaneSyntax: Bronn Cena would be far less annoying if it didn't go off when other people summoned it
[1:22:07] devslewa: @Towelliee can i get your elvui for the demon hunter anywhere?
[1:22:09] raldrik: going to project 60 all of your toons inbetween patches?
[1:22:27] Aervyper: @Towelliee think there is a new race or class coming in 10.)?
[1:22:53] MayroVision: @aervyper I asked the same thing. :)
[1:23:44] Aervyper: any answer?
[1:23:49] ZakuzaGB: what are the lego costs on your server like
[1:24:09] MayroVision: @aervyper nah, someone mentioned a “Tinker class”
[1:24:11] hotrod147: whats the addon for rares flashing
[1:24:38] CrusaderNero: yes tinker classi is coming Jebaited
[1:24:55] SSD511_: Rip I used to be the main tank for our guild and now they replaced me for a brand new fortnite kid player as a tank LUL @crusadernero
[1:25:14] szble: the horror of more possible tinker threads
[1:25:21] jamarky23: why not?
[1:25:21] CrusaderNero: @CrispyMarch we old farts cant keep up
[1:25:29] ZakuzaGB: if theres a dragon themed tank i would play the feck out of that
[1:25:29] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I would believe that some Dragon Knight or something is coming as a mail class, if something is coming
[1:25:30] ancksuamoon: @Towelliee best flavour of G-fuel?
[1:25:31] Jimstur: it has been a looong time without a new class
[1:25:32] MayroVision: @crispymarch pour one out for the homies.
[1:25:35] Makkelele: Sadly I dont think so either.. they have to much to change already
[1:25:39] SSD511_: @crusadernero agree lol
[1:25:43] mavericks312: nah pandas were trash lol
[1:25:45] CrusaderNero: ppl been going mental on mmo-champion about tinkers. its funny
[1:25:47] boopbopbamski: this next xpack seems like a perfect time for a new class
[1:25:50] xFevers: Pandas suck

[1:32:22] toyhutt: @ventu105 Classic has the old school feels, but even though have started to die on the vine.  I've headed back to Retail after 2+ years on Classic
[1:32:26] raye_gaming22: they are a meme class that dies in the first 1 min or the fight
[1:32:27] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[1:33:04] TheCheeseWheel87: Are you sure, I thought they were Towellietes
[1:33:05] SSD511_: Hogger pog
[1:33:09] szble: gonna be sad when theres no class but thats the way it is
[1:33:16] jamarky23: he knew
[1:33:17] Zettabyte: @Towelliee and Hogger has made The Stockade his "garrison"
[1:33:21] xFevers: Hemroids + hogger
[1:33:27] Lexi__Marie: stormwind stockades as the starting zone Kappa
[1:33:27] R0NGG: I predicted hoggeroids back in bfa.. EZ
[1:33:31] fred_birkhoff: you can get this skill called Preparation H for Hoggerhoids
[1:33:35] Peanutbeards: As a Hoggeroid you gain tons of threat from behind.
[1:33:36] 0nlypals: The hoggerknights
[1:33:39] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee I haven’t played since mid last year.  How bad is it to hop back in and be relevant for dungeons, etc?
[1:33:44] snake_like: WoW: Hoggerfight
[1:33:45] jamarky23: @R0NGG no fucking way dude!?
[1:33:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: no candle is safe
[1:33:54] iitsmadness: new race tho
[1:33:58] mavericks312: new spec feral druid lmao
[1:34:14] snake_like: ^ that hurts
[1:34:18] Tonystarks_: Shame they gave up on the idea from Legion about class specific weapons and the stories behind them...
[1:34:27] R0NGG: @R0NGG ya Im pretty insane at predictions KEKW
[1:34:36] katokal: chests give 10-15, rares give either 50 or 75 flux per
[1:34:39] PhatManPyro: so new class is not tank
[1:34:42] Clicklesly: There's specific chests that give 200, if you haven't open all those already ^^
[1:34:43] cruzeal: FeelsBadMan
[1:34:51] Kaype92: I just want new skins in Lost Ark… also adjust the honing in T3 to that of the KR servers…
[1:35:05] biirrd: I like to see changes to the game, so when I login, i can ask my self, What to do today, and all of them progress my account in some way.. and all things is account wide.
[1:35:08] cruzeal: i play feral
[1:35:13] Tarryble: i love feral, just unplayable unfortunately :'(
[1:35:13] iitsmadness: it was gonna be quite fine this patch before they nerfed it by 70% LUL
[1:35:16] TheCliffyShow: Just be a man and play a rogue.
[1:35:22] DiiscoViking: feral is fun in pvp
[1:35:30] annokev: We found him,
[1:35:33] KrakonSkullz: Soda plays Feral when he plays
[1:35:39] dianthusnemo: feral os ;)  resto main
[1:35:41] Zeke_nl: vdh so fun and tanky
[1:35:43] Tarryble: feral is only viable for pvp cheese builds
[1:35:45] mavericks312: why play feral when you can play something fun like frost mage lol
[1:35:46] CrusaderNero: yeah account wide gotta be a thing in 10.0. im fucking sick and tierd of the stupid grinds we gotta do over and over
[1:35:55] pereadin: You can play feral but the real question is CAN you play feral.  Its one of those classes with a super high skill cap that very few players can play it at
[1:36:04] Lexi__Marie: nothing wrong with being a cat
[1:36:09] fred_birkhoff: lol
[1:36:14] snipsfan: kol
[1:36:15] LordKain73: unholy for life!
[1:36:18] CrusaderNero: why be a cat
[1:36:32] snake_like: feral druid doesn't even really need to snapshot anymore. they've decimated them
[1:36:33] Thoreya: im having a fucking blast with survival and enhance rn
[1:36:37] boopbopbamski: account wide rep would be amazing Kreygasm at least make it so old xpacks reps are account wide and current can be per chracter
[1:36:48] brewgamingtv: It's cuz the other melee specs are just better and bring more then what feral brings at this point
[1:36:58] s10g0d: s10g0d subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[1:37:03] Bawpears: Our monk tank last night finally got his 4 piece. That set bonus too good lol
[1:37:06] Velashen: They need a complete rework
[1:37:10] annokev: I play shaman and this is the first time in a while someone actually wants me to dps and not heal
[1:37:12] onybear: If I wasn’t at work I would totally invite you to twisting nether….but alas  I am working to afford WoW
[1:37:13] FiveFingerTurkey: bro i want to try feral
[1:37:30] TheCliffyShow: If Blizzard wants people to play feral then make cat form look like a anime catgirl.
[1:37:31] snake_like: combat -> outlaw. survival -> melee survival. maybe feral will get a new identity instead of assassination cat
[1:37:53] CrusaderNero: this zone died off when ppl got flying
[1:37:53] Kaype92: @towelliee actually haven’t tried gunlancer yet, would I need the barricade engraving for either build?
[1:37:58] Kameellian: do you know if they fixed new lfr wing?
[1:37:58] Velashen: Well the animations for the forms are bad too. So yeah.
[1:38:03] cruzeal: that wouldn't work 😡
[1:38:04] TheCliffyShow: And, that's why it's funny.
[1:38:08] Gurtogg: how is prot pally on 10.0 f&f alpha
[1:38:09] brewgamingtv: feral just need a rotation rework
[1:38:12] Tarryble: true @snake_like
[1:38:15] itszanzan: id play one fit hey just made them stand up kinda like a worgen.
[1:38:31] szble: wonder if they'll give worgen tails finally

[1:39:41] boopbopbamski: I hope we get to see ion talk about it!!!
[1:39:43] Peanutbeards: I think Towelliee has Ion locked in his basement dungeon with all this new info

[1:41:45] mizuwaer: @Towelliee hopefully no borrowed power and etc
[1:41:48] Kinghorn: he thinks ion is gonna show his face IonJam
[1:41:50] Amarlian: @CrusaderNero I would be. Blizzard has it's issues but they aren't that bad. It will be a reveal with some information and maybe a cinematic with more information to come
[1:41:54] Clicklesly: I kinda doubt it would be Ion, he's not really the hype guy ^^
[1:41:55] Velashen: I bet he won’t be speaking.
[1:41:56] Phantomstrk: LFR is now just a tank and spank

[1:47:39] fooxytv: have you attempted the mage tower again for the green bear?
[1:48:17] akia03: do 2 on use trinkets still put each other on cd if you use 1
[1:48:47] Phantomstrk: maybe after the cinematic video, then the magic water guy comes out and gives a briefing
[1:48:49] PlotKox: They should merge more servers and remove the annoying no trade with characters from servers. It stops people from being able to be friendly and trade with other players

[2:55:46] Tokies: @mavericks312 no but I wouldn't mine more pets and something to grind and sell. I'm not mad at it. Something to do is something to do. I would hate a powergrind though. I'm sick of losing power. I want to feel stupid powerful at the end of an xpac. I also think searching for something is fun
[2:55:50] DeanoTV: a grind keeps people playing

[3:02:09] woodchuck91: LFR xD
[3:02:10] temp3st98: legion was the best of the 2 previous expansion bfa made it worse but sl is just bad

[3:03:11] jerexify: @Towelliee If only cross-faction was a thing already, I'd go with you. I have 4-piece and can trade.
[3:03:15] Kinghorn: I loved AP
[3:03:19] zSKIz1: i can't wait for the 9-5 series lol
[3:03:24] warrenny: @temp3st98 Sl was pretty good improvement over bfa
[3:03:24] stratiss: I just didn't like the feeling of falling behind on AP. And doing it on multiple characters.
[3:03:27] LurkLimit: I just don't like borrowed power. I wish more of the stuff would stay
[3:04:31] mavericks312: @LurkLimit but keeping systems into a new xpac the community would call them lazy
[3:05:01] biirrd: And as always, way to much HP on LFR boss.

[3:05:40] LurkLimit: @mavericks312 That why I hate how Blizz listens. The hate is always the loudest.
[3:06:20] kashmara: man, I love the horde music from bfa
[3:07:04] mavericks312: @LurkLimit for me anima was a waste to grind cause it didnt improve my toon at all
[3:07:16] akia03: would you ever go dps on your warrior @Towelliee
[3:07:27] jerexify: I wish Blizzard would start an expansion like they've ended several. All the catch-ups and stuff available from the start.
[3:07:56] Niksen_99: This is a fun fight on LFR
[3:08:25] LurkLimit: @mavericks312 I agree 100 percent. Especially now I only use  it to gear alts in Zerith.
[3:08:37] Kameellian: you going to open group after this?
[3:08:51] j_bar111: Thats what she said
[3:08:54] Niksen_99: Yeah but its fun to pump on lich king LUL
[3:08:57] Wcvechten: the down phase would make it probably to easy to wipe due to the energy mechanic you hvae to meet

[3:26:37] faulen: you can do 1 a week at the start
[3:26:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: That flux is easy to get, just do things in Zereth Mortis.....chests, rares, dailies, weeklies
[3:26:55] Ertra: but theres SO much flux available in ZM, so it's not a big deal
[3:27:07] ArcaneSyntax: it's like 1500 flux for the tier slots, so it's not a lot, I'll still have 30k Flux
[3:27:10] mrpresbaby: how much flux for one piece?
[3:27:17] j_bar111: I was just wondering b/c i got some new legos on an alt

[3:35:21] cahoots82: sure, but whats 7k anima now?
[3:35:23] pereadin: its good vendor gold though
[3:35:27] pixxelina: think we all fell on that trap at first lol
[3:35:42] Lexi__Marie: you could spend anima on raw materials in oribos
[3:36:14] Clicklesly: And on a fresh 60 you kinda need 226 gear to actually be able to kill anything in ZM
[3:36:17] Pritamin: camp the dune boss and pray
[3:36:22] SethBrowning: Yes
[3:36:22] The_Metal_Man: codex might be decent for DH

[3:36:27] Alegnowar: u can kill the dune boss for a chance on a 246 weapon
[3:36:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 226 anima trinkets are DPS only I think, but it's more agility
[3:37:04] SethBrowning: Broker's Accessory
[3:37:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is a trinket that procs more secondary stats or the damage one there
[3:37:36] Deadcells: Dude trinkets are the most annoying thing to get
[3:37:38] Gurtogg: 246 already lol

[4:08:18] pereadin: ideally we get uhr
[4:08:29] pereadin: we got wo out of panic most likely there
[4:08:48] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Do you see them letting warriors become viable as tanks again?
[4:08:54] Demanisraar: so you invis the first pack?
[4:09:25] micha3lsc0tt: everything is always about the meta
[4:09:30] micha3lsc0tt: play what you like
[4:09:31] phigment: It almost seems a lot of people mix up Viable with Top tier.
[4:09:44] mavericks312: unless your echo or liquid eveyrthing is viable
[4:09:53] Technogre: yer either first or yer last Kappa
[4:09:55] Demanisraar: ^^
[4:10:00] CYNIC308: that has always been a problem in WoW the diff between number and viable is super small but peeps only think in op or trash meta
[4:10:02] mavericks312: well except feral lol

[4:15:03] CYNIC308: there are feral druids in top5 dps in TBC raids right now and a top500 dps in retail tho
[4:16:36] jaalexba: World of Nameplates
[4:16:47] AlphasaurusRexx: feral druids are fairly decent with tier and double leggo. people just dont know how to optimize the playstyle, or are brainwashed by the stigma that overshadows them.
[4:17:17] Havoc_S1: How is boomys holding ip
[4:17:17] Deadcells: That is every class

[4:17:24] AlphasaurusRexx: from a dps perspective at least
[4:17:30] jaalexba: @AlphasaurusRexx or just delusional
[4:17:42] AlphasaurusRexx: @AlphasaurusRexx that too lol
[4:17:45] Deadcells: Every class if played right can parse really high
[4:18:18] AlphasaurusRexx: well parsing is based off of others of the same class isnt it?
[4:18:27] MILESkg21: feral just doesnt bring anything useful to the grp KEKW
[4:18:49] AlphasaurusRexx: @MilesKG21 as a dk all i care about is roar lol. im slow as fuck
[4:19:05] StarPriestessShika: if only feral had a battle rez, or movement buff for group, or mass entangling root

[4:20:22] AlphasaurusRexx: @MilesKG21 yeah wrath walk sucks ballsack
[4:20:36] Deadcells: So if you are in that range you will parse high as a fetal druid

[4:21:07] AlphasaurusRexx: from a dps perspective feral is good, but bringing one is based off stigma that balance is miles ahead.
[4:21:16] AlphasaurusRexx: in utility and dps
[4:21:51] JiberishUI: just logged on my lock that's sitting in Boralus and wouldn't have ever thought I'd miss this place but damn it's actually such a sick area
[4:22:07] AlphasaurusRexx: in a prog setting, range dps and innervate is huge.
[4:23:12] Its_Me_MG: naked you say slootSmug
[4:23:21] Deadcells: You are not wrong but play what makes you happy. If you enjoy feral more then play it
[4:23:30] Deadcells: Because you will do higher dps
[4:23:37] AlphasaurusRexx: i absolutely agree with you there
[4:23:48] AlphasaurusRexx: meta slaves are weird to me
[4:24:16] CYNIC308: yea peeps forget that RWF top guilds arent defining the meta so much as preparing for unexpected mechanics ... meta comes weeks after RWF
[4:24:41] WundertueteGER: I hope next expansion will be only new affixes
[4:24:45] Deadcells: Same I enjoy shadow priest and I do extremely well regardless of what the meta says
[4:25:32] AlphasaurusRexx: i love spriest, but im dog at maintaining multidot lol
[4:25:41] dimofodi: I'd like to see a system like Ellesmere mention, redo M+, no Tyrannical/Fort, implement kiss/curse affixes, move seasonal affixes to the lower keys so everyone gets to see them.
[4:25:48] AlphasaurusRexx: so i stay away from it
[4:26:00] Deadcells: Comes with practice

[4:47:26] HaloS23: @Towelliee Id be game for that!
[4:47:27] pereadin: they would have to make the first patch longer if they did that to compensate for lost leveling time
[4:47:36] nolank85: Level squish every expansion yep
[4:47:55] mizuwaer: @Towelliee or they could do something like in GW2 or ESO

[4:52:36] raye_gaming22: cuz you lost all the wather from the carbs
[4:52:41] smashwow: maybe it's a water thing?

[4:53:05] toobaked1987: I dropped 26lbs in a single week on keto
[4:53:07] phigment: its shredding the water weight and bloating type stuff. the first month my buddy and I both pissed gallons a day
[4:53:09] DevilSpire: isnt keto mainly for fat loss and not weight loss?
[4:53:15] mytherel: yep that happens, but you do level off. I am about 4 months in right now 20g carbs zero sugar everyday

[5:13:46] CrunkyBrewster: @Critcobain yeah pretty much that was my experience. I have to have some sort of Boss Mods though. Especially for Mythic+
[5:14:08] CritcobainTV: @Demanisraar I'm not gonna mess with it, it's too much work to switch my SSD / HDD's and stuff over just to try it out. I'll just live with a worse pc for awhile lol

[5:14:40] Molvonos: I won't do Mists without my cheat addon for the stupid maze.
[5:14:41] Demanisraar: @Critcobain it's only a cable at the back bro... from the monitor to a port
[5:15:06] CrunkyBrewster: speaking of addons, and PC issues. I found that the majority of my problems were having too many addons. Shadowlands really did a number on my pc, where I have upgrade it eventually. So I had to cut back on the addons I was using
[5:15:26] CrunkyBrewster: that helped me at least
[5:15:33] mmrghost7: take him to the corner
[5:15:56] CritcobainTV: @Demanisraar LUL Nah dude, it means dragging the 60 lb pc over to where mine is set up in order to unplug things from this PC to plug into that PC, just for it to possibly not work and drag shit around the house more. I'm good, this PC works
[5:16:48] Demanisraar: Can also only move a monitor... but whatever dude, was just trying to help
[5:17:41] CritcobainTV: @Demanisraar and i appreciate the help, but i like I said I'll just use this one for now also that other PC doesn't have a power cord, which means unpluggnig this one, to plug in for that one lol, it's all types of janky over here
