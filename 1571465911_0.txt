[1:12:03] nois3freak: the vinegar chef
[1:12:11] Jonsbe: @Swifty If your dish tastes too sour try to add sweetness—think sugar, honey (it's healthy!), cream or even caramelized onions. You can also dilute the dish (same as you would with a dish with too much salt). As a last resort, add a pinch of baking soda to make the dish more alkaline
[1:12:15] markco_wins: also +375 cooking
