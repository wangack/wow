[2:08:11] GarebearGamingTTV: Have you ever thought of rebuilding your old Youtube style of incorporating exercise before gaming in WoW or other games? I think that stuff was class and as a young teenager at the time it helped me realize my nerdy butt could do that stuff too.

[2:11:57] GarebearGamingTTV: I think HC is such a breathe of fresh air for WoW, I think you'll see a new resurgence. And the shorts are a great idea.
[2:11:59] OldManFal: Nice to see KFC is gone lol
[2:12:10] OldManFal: @bistraya_seledka lizzWAVES
[2:12:14] Ev0hz: shorts is a great way to reach out to an audience

[2:13:55] bloodbraid41: swiftyHype
[2:15:15] hellslayer6969: Is this allowed when it comes to HC rules? :O
[2:15:30] Cowardpatty: Yes
[2:15:42] bistraya_seledka: Found paladin's error (judgement could apply to several targets) about half a year after WoW Classic opened. Pretty sure it's still not fixed. At least was not in TBCC.
[2:15:52] hellslayer6969: so we allowed to group without grouping?
[2:16:06] hellslayer6969: They added the soul link to even out the duos i'd say
[2:16:06] jozearceios: why u dont like horde?
[2:16:29] IncinerateGaming: My cat's breath smells like cat food FeelsBadMan
[2:16:41] GarebearGamingTTV: I wouldn't even be surprised if you were responsible for the stereotype that blizzard nerfed and hated Warriors the most.. besides Ghostcrawler admitting to hating Warriors.. having someone do all the the ability testing for them on that one class (because honestly NO other class got the indepth tutorial treatment. Other content creators tried to follow your style, but you had a huge backlog compared to them.)
[2:17:29] bistraya_seledka: You could apply, for example, judgement of light (healing on hitting target) to several targets as long as you keep hitting them once every 10 seconds (up to 40 seconds with talents).
[2:17:58] noble_daf: It's nice to have you while driving @swifty

[2:59:40] bistraya_seledka: If it was 20 minutes, then everybody would have had it by now, so it would have been in stock.
[2:59:53] CptSpock: just continue leveling, your mace is good enough
[2:59:54] Stromboli32: How many hm characters have you started?
[3:00:07] redzoid92: I waited for it yesterday it took an hour
[3:00:16] HylissangLoL: !age
[3:00:21] GourexsGaming: Swifty I wanna send you a picture from BlizzCon of me and you!!
[3:01:56] Shaxew: getting lucky is the way to go
[3:02:37] back2r00ts: warrior shaman :)
[3:02:45] Meatchopper: Duo dual boxing sounds AMAZING :O
[3:02:53] Hyoox: can you dual box in hc rules
[3:02:54] Meatchopper: great idea
[3:02:57] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you can take up tailoring with enchanting as a priest and finally earn money by selling magic wands!
[3:03:17] Metalcalfe: not allowed to sell stuff on the AH
[3:03:31] spyroGTR: SELFMADE I THINK IS BETTER IN STATS
[3:03:34] spyroGTR: i could be wrtong
[3:04:12] bistraya_seledka: The strongest arrows/bullets from a vendor is only level 45, I think.
[3:06:23] back2r00ts: careful respawn is crazy in that cave
[3:06:24] Dark_Wolf_Entity: Damn Swifty is the backround real or is it a greenscreen? Looks awesome!
[3:06:25] Aldever13: not right hen i join the stream lol
[3:06:26] Hyoox: @bistraya_seledka nice one when most hc players dying before lvl 20
[3:06:29] Stickypanini: The famous last words "do i have food?" LUL
[3:06:36] Ayzu96: !followage
[3:06:45] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, if you go duo, warrior with a paladin is a good group. Paladins get great damage output from warrior while the warrior never has to stop for healing.
[3:06:47] Aldever13: @Swifty you are at the level i died at
[3:06:58] oliverkohrtz: is this duo hardcore?
[3:07:03] bistraya_seledka: @Hyoox, true, but what if at that specific run they won't.
[3:07:03] klement_irl: !death
[3:07:08] Hyoox: yes
[3:07:29] bistraya_seledka: And even 1 level 59 death will need a lot of low-levels to die to bring average that low.
[3:07:40] senpaiOPPAIonegaishimasu: died in this tunnel already, feelsbad
[3:07:48] back2r00ts: normaly it has 2 in stock
[3:08:09] Littlehoodie16: they respawn behind you and ahead of you
[3:08:17] Hyoox: @bistraya_seledka but still why ya saying best arrows etc are for lvl 45 when swifty is almost 15
[3:08:19] Littlehoodie16: this place is a death trap
[3:08:40] senpaiOPPAIonegaishimasu: yup
[3:08:48] Spart4nm4n: @Swifty  "you got my attention....... Safe Travels"
[3:08:52] senpaiOPPAIonegaishimasu: a total graveyard
[3:09:33] Dark_Wolf_Entity: @Swifty Is the camra background real or greenscreen? Looks awesome.
[3:09:53] oliverkohrtz: just found out that i followed you on twitch since 2014, first time tuning in to the stream in years. Nice to see you still stream, you're a legend!
[3:09:59] daftect: Is this a duo?
[3:10:11] ottomonster: !followage
[3:10:14] ottomonster: !follow
[3:10:25] Dark_Wolf_Entity: It's really damn gnarly looking, well done man!
[3:10:27] oliverkohrtz: !follow
[3:10:30] senpaiOPPAIonegaishimasu: scary
[3:10:43] brownlizard3: 3d printed?
[3:11:14] baldylocks80: You no take candle!
[3:12:28] saizo: nightelf dead ??
[3:12:40] Sukkerknal: hey swifty :-D love from denmark
[3:12:50] Spart4nm4n: wait where are you reading thiese comments?
[3:12:51] LX2_EXE: You know what they say about tiny head
[3:12:54] LX2_EXE: heads
[3:13:06] Spart4nm4n: ill still buy that zelda sword from ya
[3:14:16] Captura68: Why everyone is playing classic and not retail ?
[3:14:16] Carepai: 11/12
[3:14:38] Pricanballer34: Your not being followed anymore?
[3:14:40] tigzie: hardcore challenge
[3:14:47] bistraya_seledka: @Captura68, those are two different games.
[3:14:56] spyroGTR: so what do you like more hardcore classic or retail?
[3:15:01] daftect: !dead
[3:15:11] Aldever13: Did doubledown leave?
[3:15:17] daftect: !death
[3:15:38] bistraya_seledka: @Rezzlebolt, probably damaged too badly during the fight.
[3:15:54] Silvestina: still 11/12 ears
[3:16:00] bistraya_seledka: @Rezzlebolt, wait until he gets to insignii at Arathi.
[3:16:02] Silvestina: nvm
[3:16:20] Carepai: hunters are great at lvling but are bad in end game
[3:16:27] aviduser2: did u got the mace from vendor?
[3:16:30] NoManele: pet can be a blessing or a curse
[3:16:39] aviduser2: or it didnt come back?
[3:16:57] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, double support as paladins/shamen is better than double healer.
[3:17:11] JoNuhH_: NO
[3:17:13] Carepai: double nelf warrior
[3:17:20] hawkingsill: Two Hunters is crazy
[3:18:01] STEFOXYS: Multiboxing is not allowed if you wish to remain valid HC characters.
[3:18:39] xttjordan: What servers are good for vanilla classic that aren't HC?
[3:18:45] LX2_EXE: Guess you're reformatting it then
[3:19:35] xttjordan: Is that horde or alliance?  @tribalsh
[3:19:36] bistraya_seledka: @xttjordan, if you're not sure, you might want to try roleplaying realms. Community there is generally a bit better.
[3:19:46] yesitssssssssss: Shooter games needed for swifty
[3:19:48] LX2_EXE: Yeah I would create a second login
[3:19:59] yesitssssssssss: asmmar55 asmmar55 asmmar55
[3:20:10] SilkeySmooth: double ele shaman
[3:20:29] hawkingsill: double mage infinity slow
[3:20:37] NoManele: yes but you need to drink after each mob :))
[3:20:38] Rastafaris: hey swifty
[3:20:48] steinarfj80: check kara adams shield crafter in lakeshire,she sells shield lvl 18 and 20 green ones
[3:20:51] Littlehoodie16: i wonder if hardcore classic will still be popular after patch 10.1 for retail
[3:20:59] SilkeySmooth: double druid
[3:21:11] NoManele: also if you get hit twice as a mage you are dead
[3:21:29] attilalfde: GlitchCat SingsNote
[3:21:31] Hyoox: i hope that blizz hardcore server is without addons
[3:21:49] Silvestina: I almost forgot how little you have in classic :D
[3:22:10] Hyoox: mortal strike
[3:22:39] skaare1: macroman
[3:24:05] bistraya_seledka: If you have a weapon in slot N and shield in slot N+1, and then you take it and put two-hander into inventory (slot N), and if you pick up some loot, will the macro break?
[3:24:39] QuinHelmisch: You need 3 points in it
[3:24:56] hawkingsill: mace sale at the merchant?
[3:25:26] midianite23: i wouldnt go with what swifty says
[3:25:31] midianite23: he barely knows any class
[3:26:01] SoerlinTV: Warlock/Paladin, is super fun, Demo Sac warlock rain of fire/hellfire aoe everything while paladin tanks and uses blessing of wisdom + seal of wisdom to keep up warlock mana
[3:26:07] NoHablaEng: !death
[3:26:13] BoricuaSJ: why have you not used your talent points?
[3:26:14] QuinHelmisch: 3 points in mastery -> switch with 15 rage then bloodrage (you have 25 rage) into insta whirlwind
[3:26:34] bistraya_seledka: @SoerlinTV, that's a very boring use of a paladin.
[3:27:11] jozearceios: i love her
[3:27:44] xmedpakx: nah you can swim
[3:27:50] khuklen: das boat
[3:28:05] Metalcalfe: you can swim up the shore from westfall to wetlands
[3:28:19] back2r00ts: there is a save way over the mountains
[3:28:19] staticoverloadx: Teagen is alliance now :)
[3:28:25] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, @Teagens, there are two level ~22 orcs on the path between Loch Modan and Wetlands that are on some tight road.
[3:29:01] dropawpplzz: @Swifty you think fresh classic server coming soon ?
[3:29:02] LX2_EXE: you're not that far from wetlands being in loch modan
[3:29:03] hawkingsill: dagger easy silver
[3:29:10] attilalfde: Elwynn Forest Music :) <3 SingsNote GlitchCat
[3:29:43] SoerlinTV: @bistraya_seledka I don't think it is. It's either that or, Holy specc to keep the Warlock alive and sustain his life taps
[3:29:59] sneakypky93: Thats not worth
[3:30:01] sneakypky93: at all
[3:30:15] Hyoox: not worth
[3:30:22] JuggaBugga: ayee lvl 14 noice
[3:30:39] Hyoox: darkshore is not worth
[3:30:41] squuuuid: best place to buy health pots?
[3:30:50] Harlowyn: SHAME
[3:30:58] anabolics_: Darkshore is good
[3:30:59] LX2_EXE: Nobody cuts lines around here right Swifty
[3:31:02] anabolics_: Lots of greens
[3:31:32] frizygerman: Whats the best class for beginners in HC ?
[3:31:37] Chrimz_: pOG
[3:31:42] Chrimz_: Pog*
[3:31:46] Hyoox: oh looks good
[3:31:49] goobis_123: that look good
[3:31:50] LX2_EXE: damn that looks good
[3:31:50] bistraya_seledka: @SoerlinTV, never tried that particular duo, but paladin generally can support a warlock's life tap. But two paladins should be much more fun.
[3:31:55] anabolics_: Darkshore
[3:32:10] anabolics_: Lots of greens in Darkshore
[3:32:20] bistraya_seledka: @squuuuid, alchemy shops? There are sometimes some of them there.
[3:32:46] bistraya_seledka: @frizygerman, go for the one you enjoy the image of. Or hunter/warlock.
[3:33:00] truelazyplayer: Hi Swifty What is the addon that show you the quests on the right side of the screen?
[3:33:14] Chrimz_: @funkymonkyr Questie
[3:33:29] attilalfde: enjoy your meal... :)
[3:33:40] TheseDaysLIVE: Oh no you died on NE?
[3:34:17] frizygerman: I want to Play Paladin but i think its hard because hes only Auto attacking in classic
[3:34:34] anabolics_: Loved your old Warrior videos, first Warcraft youtuber i got introduced to as a kid , much love :)
[3:35:11] bistraya_seledka: @frizygerman, only if you don't know what you're doing. There are situations when you switch auri and blessing and seals and judgements during a single fight if you learnt what's good for which situation.
[3:35:12] endraax: u need repair
[3:35:18] jxdo: swiftyirl needs return
[3:35:20] truelazyplayer: Hi Swifty What is the addon that show you the quests on the right side of the screen?
[3:35:27] Cowardpatty: On it...
[3:35:34] bistraya_seledka: @frizygerman, auto-attack simulator is like grinding green enemies: slow but safe.
[3:35:55] frizygerman: In hear about that Seal twisting
[3:35:56] sn1lonestarr: if ur duo or trio die you all die?
[3:36:04] weezntv: what is that voice addon?

[3:37:11] redbeardvikinger: Dual box hc ?
[3:37:12] Hyoox: can you dualbox in hc rules ?
[3:37:13] STEFOXYS: multiboxing is not allowed for HC @Swifty
[3:37:25] cabrokz: Cool dragons dude
[3:37:27] Hyoox: its not allowed
[3:37:33] bistraya_seledka: @frizygerman, with proper use of seal and judgement you can even kill monsters non-stop by yourself without stopping to restore health or mana.
[3:37:50] killscripts: Can you multibox in HC?
[3:38:07] back2r00ts: get the FP
[3:38:09] redbeardvikinger: No

[3:39:10] NoManele: he is clicking with his feat
[3:39:21] Broomba: any multiboxing or duo boxing is not allowed @Swifty in hard core mode
[3:39:43] Hyoox: its not rude
[3:40:02] killscripts: Who decides these rules?  Is there a council?
[3:40:14] Hyoox: @Swifty you have installed that hc addon
[3:40:17] saso_panelakovy: go play duo with her LUL
[3:40:28] NoManele: @killscripts Joe

[3:48:20] Vividgamers: Crazy question do you macro all your abilities just so you use the best rank ability?
[3:48:21] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, what is the use of using a macro to simple cast a spell?
[3:48:38] RadiationWoW: Who's he streaming with?

[4:04:13] Lotsovkhaos: As alliance you do come back but yeah
[4:04:34] bistraya_seledka: There are no good flying paths going through Loch Modan. Badlands have no birdmaster and Searing Gorge is straight from Ironforge.
[4:05:20] mixtik123: Is he doing duo?
[4:05:22] mechanobilive: The best I got in HC is 21:( died in Ashenvale...
[4:05:33] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you might be fine, especially if hamstring works.

[4:07:51] tonimahhh: I miss the days when rico would head lock u
[4:07:53] xmedpakx: even at 18 its dangerous
[4:07:56] mechanobilive: Therer are orcs in this area right?
[4:08:06] Uzamaki69: ^ did u ever actually beat rico?
[4:08:08] Cowardpatty: Quality is not great, because I had to use different software to capture YouTube
[4:08:26] tonimahhh: they got into some crazy duels
[4:08:31] bistraya_seledka: @DarkSock, two that can be accidently pulled.
[4:08:46] Shalyon: the one shot 93M dmg in temple of kotmogu?
[4:08:51] bistraya_seledka: @DarkSock, some are in the southern Wetlands, but not by the road they're going by.
[4:08:54] Shalyon: i remember that video
[4:09:42] Digmadness: lol
[4:09:46] xanchoviox: Swifty! I died at 45!
[4:09:52] warmachine1101: I remeber that video it was when I started watch you Swifty
[4:10:04] mechanobilive: Swifty trying to get to Darnassus?

[4:11:05] Dragoninja35: Hello everyone
[4:11:50] bistraya_seledka: @dragoninja34, hello.
[4:12:03] just_gg_s: Swifty ftw
[4:12:08] Aradic: what a great story should write a book
[4:12:47] mechanobilive: THere is a Legend:) Clique on Darkspear are the ones that made Prepared wow quit.
[4:13:09] mechanobilive: They hunted him on puropse for months
[4:13:48] mechanobilive: I lead CLique:)
[4:13:48] Sathion: Where do you download HC WoW?
[4:14:00] mechanobilive: Years ago, but we hunted him for months
[4:14:04] ArukuGaming: Its just classic @Sathion
[4:14:07] Aradic: damn that's a lot of stream snipers helping you
[4:14:19] mechanobilive: Relentlessly hunted PreparedWOW for months. Anytime he logged on we hunted him.
[4:14:27] orgnalf: is getting escorted through wetlands not against ToS?
[4:14:51] ArukuGaming: He didnt ask
[4:14:52] orgnalf: i was askin
[4:14:53] Cowardpatty: What can he do about it?  Log off?
[4:14:58] jennindf: tos lol
[4:14:59] mechanobilive: PreparedWOW had to server change which was expensive for him... We made him do it.
[4:15:07] Aradic: so you complain about stream snipers and now you don't because they are helping. wow
[4:15:16] bistraya_seledka: @orgnalf, this is one of those escorts that seems actually legit.
[4:15:30] Cowardpatty: I think some people might call that "good karma" @Aradic
[4:15:30] mechanobilive: Yeah I am talkin years ago. But we hunted him relentlessly...
[4:15:56] Aradic: yeah totally read my mind
[4:16:10] Jkob_Jkob: what weapon you looking for btw?
[4:16:17] iamjakeyy: Bring on SoM
[4:16:39] bistraya_seledka: @orgnalf, but there are plenty of things they have already done that could be very very argueably hardcore.
[4:16:50] STEFOXYS: you can try the goblin vendor in ratchet too for 2H mace
[4:17:06] frank1do: executioner by antonio?
[4:17:10] awakenedb: HEAVY SPIKED MACE
[4:17:12] Dragoninja35: What's the difference between normal wow and hardcore haven't played since cat?
[4:17:20] obliteratoe: heavy barbed mace
[4:17:22] mentally_not_okayy: isnt it the Gladius or something?
[4:17:22] awakenedb: THATS WHAT U WANT swifty
[4:17:46] Jkob_Jkob: what lvl is it for?
[4:18:05] mechanobilive: For ya guys not sure how to destroy multi boxers all you need to do is know which character is the main character. When dead all the keybinds they use are useless.
[4:18:28] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, make sure not to jump off while inbound.
[4:18:35] xmedpakx: yay level 21!
[4:19:04] dread_kitten: i stopped asking myself if i would be doing end game content after my 4th death
[4:19:23] mechanobilive: THis is where it gets scary:) THose swamps are the end of many
[4:20:18] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, @Teagens, the Barrens are relatively safe from Theramore to Ratchet if you stay clear off the roads. Leaving Dustwallow marsh could be more dangerous.
[4:20:27] Kaetheras: target and put a mark on him
[4:20:27] awakenedb: im on my 12th warrior this week swifty. be careful xD
[4:20:42] Kaetheras: western corner of the east barracks on Theramore Isle. (wowhead comment)

[4:20:53] mechanobilive: Crockolisks
[4:21:06] yawshe: the wendigos!
[4:21:25] mechanobilive: Is Jana Proudmoor in the tower in Classic wow?
[4:21:30] bistraya_seledka: Level 6 in Dun Morogh is probably by Yeti outside Kharanos. Maybe some random bear also.
[4:21:49] bistraya_seledka: @DarkSock, she is!
[4:21:53] Cowardpatty: Stream ruined
[4:22:09] IchBinDerMax: What should liter. sell??
[4:22:13] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you can do a screenshot with Jaina while you're here!
[4:22:19] IchBinDerMax: Piter’
[4:22:29] Kaetheras: @IchBinDerMax only limited supply items

[7:03:29] MrPaulie: Doing it at 30 is death sentence. :D
[7:03:31] coinelius: a 30 warrior could kill the mob with the kite, but they couldn't kill the mobs for the prereq quest
[7:03:32] dodgydad33: you also have to get the scalps, and i bet youll level before you get them all.
[7:03:34] TheEndIsNear777: he'd have to get the boss past 50% by himself or if guards kill he won't get loot
[7:03:49] back2r00ts: but he needed like 24h for the quest at 32
[7:03:49] jmh44: !followage
[7:03:53] Vorpalwarp: @Swifty He kited the elementals to guards over the course of 9 hours and did the river strat for cyclonean
[7:04:01] Vorpalwarp: its possible to do at thirty but its not efficient whatsoever
[7:04:15] Iratic: 9 hours LOl
[7:04:17] TheEndIsNear777: 9 hours AngelThump
[7:04:17] Vorpalwarp: @Swifty Yes it took him 9 hours to farm the charms
[7:04:21] Vorpalwarp: no, 30
[7:04:23] metcalfdk: JokerD did it
[7:04:35] Oodyny: dont worry one shot macro will one shot the elite
[7:04:38] sleeplesswolf94: no, at 38 with kite strat takes like 10min or less
[7:04:40] Vorpalwarp: @Swifty whisper Getcleavedhc in game, he can explain how he did it
