[0:49:11] derElten: oi @Towelliee my main man, how are you feeling?
[0:49:20] SinicalDev: The fact it's a 1 time boost makes it better as well I think
[0:49:30] secondarych: leveling sucks boosting is good for tbc
[0:49:36] Ulfinator: Will never understand ppl who want even a boost
[0:49:52] beckett3a: i agree
[0:50:10] Ulfinator: Nvm we’re talking about tbc leveling boost mb
[0:50:11] Kromede: ppl can't adapt to changes, good or bad
[0:50:17] tigzie: dont you still have to pay for the boost?
[0:50:20] SinicalDev: I mainly played TBC growing up, so I'm just starting classic, not everyone wants to go through the levelling again
[0:50:29] Rottencoarse: @tigzie  yup
[0:50:40] imurweaknesslive: My biggest issue with the mad season video was how he framed it in a way that almost vilifies people who are ok with the boost, saying they dont actually care about new players and that people that want it just dont know anything.
[0:50:43] Rottencoarse: @SinicalDev  idd lol
[0:50:48] luckfore: arent there more important things to worry about than a boost? its such a non problem
[0:51:03] Shrenko: well he doesnt

[0:51:32] beckett3a: yeah so many unwarented correlations
[0:51:38] metavahn231: its just swtor but bigger
[0:51:42] SinicalDev: By advocating for no changes then they're ensuring it slowly converges with retail as well - Which is dumb
[0:52:09] Dzponia: Comparing of how it was before and now makes it look like a dead game
[0:52:18] luckfore: ofc not
[0:52:27] metavahn231: the sky is always falling to the hardcore players LUL meanwhile millions of casuals are happily playing
[0:52:45] theoriginalzinng: i dont even want to know what ive spent name changing and race changing
[0:52:59] creedborn: Whos he talking about?
[0:52:59] luckfore: they know these kinds of videos attract alot of views
[0:53:16] tigzie: I must be the only person who wants dual spec. But I do play a paladin, so that explains a lot
[0:53:26] imurweaknesslive: botting portion of the video is a non-issue anyways, Boosters have hundreds of accounts on the go all day long leveling and gold farming.
[0:53:33] SinicalDev: Also you get dog shit dungeon blues, no proffs - Literally the bare minimum to get started
[0:53:37] secondarych: yup
[0:53:50] MrGattz: whats worse is the botting issue can be fixed. i bet you a million dollars blizzard hires me ill fix the entire botting issue in 6 months. but they wont get back to me Pepehand

[0:54:51] TemperedGaming: Fresh servers will just be just as susceptible to botting as any other server.... It will take a little longer to get there is all.
[0:54:55] sweetgoals: 20 year program you'd think they'd be able to figure out how to get rid of the bots
[0:54:56] metavahn231: yea i stopped caring about the integrity of the game, its all just going to be temporary until casuals quit and botters remain
[0:55:02] Thoreya: i mean blizz literally sent out a survey for this
[0:55:06] Thoreya: and the data spoke for itself
[0:55:07] Thoreya: lol
[0:55:14] Thoreya: people want the boosts
[0:55:14] AureliusXV: classic servers are temporary
[0:55:21] Leafylockx: same for me, i dont care a single bit about classic but would like to play tbc and would never pick up TBC if i'd have to level from 1
[0:55:24] Drogdorf: I am one of those ppl. Just want to play TBC.
[0:55:36] secondarych: ye boost is really good
[0:55:43] Thunderbrew: It's about playing the game and having fun.
[0:55:46] metavahn231: once casuals get bored and the server is 50% bots its dead to me
[0:55:47] luckfore: its just a vocal minority. Same with some of the changes in SL that blizz has no reverted becuase of baclkash
[0:55:50] bakkich: Could be sloved easliy with some fresh servers for those who wants, and continue the current toons for another
[0:55:50] imurweaknesslive: @Towelliee that is exactly my argument for boosts, its classic TBC, people shouldnt have to play through Vanilla just to play TBC because thats not what this is. its not natural progression its specifically the re release of TBC not actually the next expansion.
[0:55:57] wadethewaters: people dont want 58 boosts, are also ok with mage boosting. It makes no sense
[0:55:57] Aedarax: people think its 2005 KEKW
[0:55:58] jbeastb: I've been playing this game since it launched and I was pretty "hardcore" in vanilla... but I'm too old for that shit I have no interest in classic... but I do want to try TBC
[0:56:04] ColdChillXI: better to have options
[0:56:13] TemperedGaming: It's the vocal minority from the private server community... Used to rolling a new server every 6 months.
[0:56:17] luckfore: BabyRage No changes BabyRage
[0:56:35] AureliusXV: i was in tbc bet aback in the day
[0:56:38] buzescu: If your ppl whant to play whit you they will come and help you lvl no need for a boost
[0:56:39] beckett3a: im just glad i wont have to level the 4th time in a row and can just boost a priest lol
[0:56:46] metavahn231: infact it would make a better experience
[0:56:46] prophetMoffett: but didnt u say 40% of ppl are bots
[0:56:51] beckett3a: get in that arena action
[0:57:02] metavahn231: leveling is only fun once

[1:00:04] Thunderbrew: Casuals drive the game.
[1:00:06] SinicalDev: Gatekeeping andy's

[1:01:08] flebbooo: i feel like at this point it's just these specific classic andies who already have full naxx bis etc gatekeeping other peoples enjoyment of the game
[1:01:12] derElten: I swear to the gods, hand on my heart, I literally raid in classic with people who leveled all the way to 60 regularily and they know jack shit about their class, boosts don't play into it at all
[1:01:13] Thoreya: astra isnt approved yet in the US
[1:01:18] SinicalDev: Verizon Fios? Pog

[1:01:47] Malarick: @towelliee how do you feel after the shot?  Im nervous about getting it b/c Ive gotten flu shots in the past and been deathly ill
[1:01:50] Thunderbrew: I had the Pfizer shot and had side effects.
[1:01:56] AureliusXV: of course not
[1:01:59] metavahn231: what if youre allergic to vaccines
[1:02:00] SinicalDev: UK is mainly based on risk, then rolling brackets of ages for general population. They recently opened it up to anyone over 50

[1:02:47] Thoreya: so ppl just say they got diseases
[1:02:49] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @Towelliee i have to wait 2 more months before getting the vaccine right now in mn only people 65 and over

[1:03:19] mmrghost7: I'll never get a shot , the risk is h8gh
[1:03:28] mmrghost7: high
[1:03:30] Putcride: @towelliee was it Pfizer or modern a?
[1:03:32] Genilort: @Towelliee no side effects?
[1:03:35] vaxster86: i got my first covid shot on the 2nd of febuary (astra zeneca) had no side effects, no blood clots. only thing i had was a feeling like i had been punched in the arm really hard. (im from the UK). i do volunteering at a centre for vaccinations hence i got the shot early as a thank you for helping them out
[1:03:36] ToxicPedro: @Towelliee where i can get that juicy ui?
[1:03:46] Armdel: and my country is struggeling to vaccinate 10k people a day...
[1:03:51] jbeastb: I still don't understand why any non risk person would get that shot... the side effects can be worse  than the covid for those people
[1:03:57] anOceaninadrop: !cam @Seltherius
[1:03:57] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[1:04:12] 無職提督: iright, risk for a shot is higher than getting covid in merica
[1:04:12] Sleepy_Platypus: meanwhile belgium officials could not find their own ass in the dark ...  atleast the us is getting shit done @Towelliee
[1:04:20] 無職提督: omg
[1:04:40] Seltherius: @Spiriteaser Oh, tnx for the info
[1:04:45] KarmaTheQueen: @jbeastb Because it downs the effect of the disease, even if you are low risk. it can actually get some people harder than most.
[1:04:52] Thoreya: i think 1/8th of the US population are officaly vaccined
[1:04:53] 無職提督: and u guys got the less side effect ones, too
[1:04:54] Thoreya: as of yesterday
[1:04:58] secondarych: yep america have won COVID

[1:10:45] AureliusXV: there isnt any rush though

[1:14:42] GilianoGVK: true hhahah you leved so much just get the boost
[1:14:50] sweetgoals: what's the big attraction of playing wow for 16 years?
[1:14:50] AureliusXV: i don't plan on playing TBC classic, but if i did i would use the shit out of the boost, i couldnt even finish leveling classic
[1:14:55] Ribbwich: @svenskeren07 the SWTOR shop is tits tho
[1:15:02] Ribbwich: I wish WoW had the SWTOR shop
[1:15:04] sweetgoals: why do you love this game so much?
[1:15:05] Alegnowar: honestly all this bitching about TBC boosts are actually cringe, like it's already decided and if those classic andy's don't like it they can stay in classic
[1:15:06] AureliusXV: shit was sooo boring
[1:15:09] bluecanary1893: arnt your in game wow purchases business tax writeoffs?
[1:15:19] Thunderbrew: Freedom of choice is nice.
[1:15:32] k_randals: @towelliee Also the boost in classic has way more value. leveling takes forever vs retail.
[1:15:32] svenskavelli: Lich King Armor 55 bucks
[1:15:35] Kromede: don't give Bobby ideas with the SWTOR shop KEKWlaugh
[1:15:37] Ribbwich: @Towelliee they added mando sets, like two of them
[1:15:40] evilmech: people would still complain about boosts even if the restriction was u had to have a lvl 60 to unlock it
[1:15:42] Grawh1: The leving in TBC was bad but the rep grinds whe fucking aids
[1:15:42] Kahoolo: Starwars has shitloads of base decorations they sell too.
[1:15:43] lurkbeee: there is literally zero negative ripples that the boost causes, its only positives for TBCs population
[1:15:53] Ulfinator: If i would had to level my hunter from 1-60 again i would probably uninstall the game
[1:15:54] lurkbeee: the whole "bot" argument is nonsensical
[1:15:58] idenkaz_: ngl i bought the mando set the second it was aviable on the store. no shame

[1:16:10] AureliusXV: there will be bots regardless of a boost or not
[1:16:23] lurkbeee: indeed
[1:16:26] lurkbeee: just as there was in 2007
[1:16:30] Grawh1: I still have marks of Sagaras I can't get rid of
[1:16:30] Alegnowar: those content creators have to roll whit the complaining train otherwise they loose viewers
[1:16:34] Phindrius: @lurkbee Go check the video about the boosts from MadSeason on YT, then say there's no negatives to the boost
[1:16:34] Ribbwich: @lurkbee they are just insecure and the equivilate levels with worth.
[1:16:44] metavahn231: #somechanges has the purists on blast
[1:16:57] lurkbeee: @Phindrius Already have, literally 0 valid points

[1:18:16] beckett3a: WC3 music <3
[1:18:20] Ribbwich: @MrGattz I would bet they can just keep the 58 boost for Wrath. Idk if its necessary to do a 68 boost
[1:18:24] metavahn231: and the bots of course
[1:18:27] Genilort: it dosent effect them we all start at some point as the oters
[1:18:30] lurkbeee: exactly just like in 2007 get in your guild and live in your bubble, a bot changes nothing to whether or not i enjoy tbc etc.
[1:18:34] tigzie: yep, that paladin seal change is such a big change
[1:18:37] metavahn231: i doesnt matter what they do its just not gonna be 2004
[1:18:58] Sincline387: ask preach about "pull the ripcord" and how many followers/subs he had.....if that didn't matter a straight up cash money decision isn't going to be changed by classic andys

[1:19:53] Ribbwich: @MrGattz AH PvP is great
[1:20:08] Ribbwich: it was especially hilarious during the AQ event when I broke the linen cloth market
[1:20:27] lurkbeee: yep its still really easy to thrive in a "Broken economy" i laugh when people cry and say they are forced to buy gold and how its impossible to play
[1:20:53] metavahn231: people have to join communities and be in a bubble to play like it was 2004 kinda like they do on classic
[1:21:04] Armdel: can we reach classic levels of drama POGGERS
[1:21:23] lurkbeee: i mean really... that is the essence of vanilla/tbc, finding a community of like minded players and lose your self
[1:21:26] Ribbwich: @Towelliee are you suggesting it's a ploy for Streamers to hype up nostalgia so they can get free loot?
[1:21:34] flebbooo: So many people in denial of how people actually play video games in 2021 LUL
[1:21:44] SinicalDev: If you don't have changes, then Classic will converge with retail, which isn't the point of the product.

[1:22:52] katkis88: what are the optimal professions for prot palading going into TBC :)?
[1:23:13] Genilort: to be honest I liked leveling in outland it much more fun than in kingdoms and kalimor.
[1:23:16] lurkbeee: JC? engi?
[1:23:19] Ldysansa: Oh good. I am glad you are doing good
[1:23:23] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: DansGame
[1:23:51] katkis88: was thinking of those 2 too @lurkbee
[1:23:52] TweakT: its so easy to pvp as undead rogue I cut thru alliance like butter
[1:24:17] lurkbeee: yeah especially if the "later implemented" engi goggles are in at launch
[1:24:40] lurkbeee: and ofc the trinkets
[1:24:41] wadethewaters: Engi goggles + Epic trinkets + BIS forever necklace for melee + epic gems
[1:24:50] wadethewaters: good combo, thats what my rogue is going as well
[1:25:54] katkis88: eng/JC its going to be then, thanks for the info :)
[1:26:18] TheGaoSora: is it too late for blizz to implement #somechanges to vanilla once TBC started it's cycle?
[1:26:21] Alaquane: I think it auto flags you for pvp when you start killing their dudes

[3:00:15] jamarky23: You are 100 % correct brother

[3:01:22] Chibs243: I’ve never understood boosting. The fun, IMO, is you and your friends/guild overcoming difficult challenges. Where is the fun in a carry?
[3:01:22] enux337: inb4 they start capping resources
[3:01:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Phindrius at least WoW gives the option to buy these services with in game gold through the token not something many games do
[3:01:26] IverCold: @Towelliee What do you think about character's transfers? I'm thinking about going to Normal(PVE) for TBC

[3:06:29] kirshoxd: D:
[3:06:35] Citadell1: big true
[3:06:38] KingAdrock: what? classic was fun
[3:06:46] GKiDz: how will the token counter bots tho?
[3:06:47] Ranger208: I'm not saying whether or not tokens are a good idea but it just feels wrong to me tbh.
[3:06:47] Shrenko: but #nochanges BabyRage
[3:06:47] TweakT: they should just make an STV expansion then I'd be happy
[3:06:51] zaphstar: Beta today or next week @towelliee ? Hype has been going all week last chance today before weekend
[3:06:59] SonofHorus82: just now jumping in to the convo due to being muted for work. Do you think the token gold cost would be unreasonable in TBC?
[3:07:09] Shrenko: how much gold would a token give in TBC ?
[3:07:11] desmo7: doesnt the boost cause more bots?
[3:07:12] Merlin840: all my friends are buying gold on classic and it is honestly annoying.
[3:07:26] TweakT: the theme is so good :D
[3:07:27] Genilort: no it wasent it took forever to level and pvp was not even that fun. from a guy who played since vanilla
[3:07:29] Pippinn: so how would that work then? instead of 15 amonth i'd have to buy a wow token for my sub?
[3:07:29] GonoFPS: LUL
[3:07:30] apollobaker: Does anyone else constantly gets 8 ads in a row on mobile?
[3:07:41] kirshoxd: @SonofHorus82 token prices depend on supply and demand blizzard dont decide them
[3:07:54] metavahn231: EVE has that shit doesnt it
[3:08:10] Merlin840: about to hit 35 on my warrior i'm leveling just for BC.
[3:08:17] Phindrius: @Ranger208 100% agree with you there. Boosts + cash shop are, imo, awful additions and should never have even been considered
[3:08:18] GKiDz: tokens can gtfo
[3:08:20] gking3000: towelliee what are you gonna use your boost on? (assuming you buy one)
[3:08:21] magemaster225: wow token is gonna ding retail because now you can self sustain in classic
[3:08:24] pemadsen17: if TVC goes live with boosts, tokens are inevitably coming in the future.
[3:08:31] pemadsen17: tbc
[3:08:37] Faregon: team within classic LUL
[3:08:41] personal_raineri: a tiget team of banners :D
[3:08:44] TheLastRace: Autobots ...  Move out!
[3:08:57] Graviits: But on retail as well with these Multiboxers and bots
[3:09:09] Shrenko: mage boost inc
[3:09:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: they should monitor all boosted characters if they appear to be bots ban them and keep the money from being boosted to pay the GM Kappa
[3:09:11] Frank4LuLz: rogue
[3:09:13] jasperboy: Majority of the hardcore vanilla nerds that still play are buying gold anyway, so adding the tokens is just a plus for blizzard
[3:09:13] desmo7: they dont care THAT much :D
[3:09:16] BeedleGaming: P.S. I believe you need those feathers for a quest as well in Feralas
[3:09:22] Ranger208: I'm gonna use it on a priest. Since they suck to level LUL
[3:09:25] MuttonChopins: mltiboxers can get banned now if you report them @Graviits
[3:09:25] Merlin840: i should've boosted the warrior.. still might. or a priest.
[3:09:26] PG_diesel: Warlock
[3:09:27] GonoFPS: BM 1 shot macrro team
[3:09:27] Frank4LuLz: combat is easy
[3:09:29] TheVigiliance: Boost an ele shaman
[3:09:29] geokouts: FREE 58 boost or paid?
[3:09:32] Genilort: I got to 60 and logged out ahha rdy for tbc
[3:09:32] GonoFPS: TBC numba one
[3:09:36] Broomba: Multiboxers aren’t the same as bots
[3:09:36] Jedaero: Blizzard can't really hire people to only handle botting when 200mil is going straight to Bobby Kotick every year
[3:09:40] trickywalrus__: What do you think about potentially adding in Race Changes?
[3:09:50] Janribet: Can you wait to boost when bc comes out to boost a blood elf
[3:09:50] Just_a_random_dood: !tbc
[3:09:50] Epicsapphire1988: im going to boost a lock and shamen
[3:09:50] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.

[3:10:01] vikingjason: Blood Seal/Veng is needed as it always broken
[3:10:02] constantinfive: in classisc is just the mont fee
[3:10:07] Merlin840: hardware id ban is some intense shit
[3:10:10] vikingjason: plus it will stop all the weebs rolling belf pala
[3:10:16] Kromede: but a entire anti-bot team means less money for bobby, this may sound funny but i think it's true
[3:10:23] Epicsapphire1988: @Janribet cant boost bloodevles or drani
[3:10:24] Just_a_random_dood: what vaccine did u get?
[3:10:31] Janribet: Oh oof
[3:10:35] Genilort: gold will loose value for token
[3:10:38] Graviits: @TacoVendor93 all of his chars are still stealing our herbs, i am seeing him on a daily basis
[3:10:46] Merlin840: not no more yachts.. just less than 3 yachts per year.
[3:10:49] vikingjason: By the time we get WOTLK classic, gold will be worth less then retail
[3:10:51] vikingjason: lmao
[3:10:56] Wink05: Wink05 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[3:11:16] trivwik: Nice! Glad to hear you got the covid shot!
[3:11:19] GKiDz: how does the token help in retail? botting is still ridiculous there,,,
[3:11:29] WhiteKnight74648: A yacht may be too cheap for him
[3:11:32] Sygfreid: Money is money to them, so they probably don't care that much about bots.
[3:11:35] jackjonesiii: what do u need 200 Mil for wtf
[3:11:39] Sollice: yacht(s)
[3:11:41] Merlin840: i mean that much money.. i'm not having some dingy.. i'll have a big ass boat.
[3:11:41] wadethewaters: LOL
[3:11:41] enux337: a house in every state
[3:11:43] Frank4LuLz: sharks brah, hell no
[3:11:43] Jedaero: 200mil is only the bonus lmao, he makes way more
[3:11:43] Rexialiton: I would have 2 yachts, because why not
[3:11:52] Ranger208: I'd have a yacht that had its own yacht.
[3:11:59] vikingjason: It's just a way for blizzard to get a slice of that cake from the botters, since you know, they don't actually give af about the game, just the coin it generates of people who are addicted to the game.
[3:12:00] Wcvechten: I'd get a yacht for my yacht
[3:12:10] TMMOOF: Iron Horde Vessel LUL
[3:12:10] jackjonesiii: yacht is too much work lmao
[3:12:12] Frank4LuLz: you want a chopper
[3:12:14] Rexialiton: Yes!
[3:12:20] GonoFPS: LUL
[3:12:20] Tiamattinen: Have a yacht that looks like Orgrimmar and one that looks like Stormwind, then crash the Orgrimmar one into the Stormwind
[3:12:21] WhiteKnight74648: I would go to that park
[3:12:22] personal_raineri: a yacht adn a smaller yacht parked inside
[3:12:25] adambtwitchtv: A yacht and a chef onboard for sure
[3:12:29] retiiful: now thats truly horrifying
[3:12:29] Merlin840: 100 million on a private jet (budget for yearly maintenance. ) and you're golden.
[3:12:33] Alaquane: towelclause's workshop
[3:12:45] SonofHorus82: Instead of water in the log ride it would be all gfuel in the water tanks.
[3:12:49] Shrenko: are you running any dungeon today @Towelliee ?
[3:12:51] Zettabyte: @Towelliee naaah, Super Star Destroyer, nothing less Kappa
[3:12:54] trickywalrus__: What do you think about potentially adding in Race Changes?
[3:13:00] WhiteKnight74648: Towelliee's theme park would be great for Christmas too :-)
[3:13:11] Merlin840: i'm not chartering no damned jet if i'm making that much money. i'm owning it.
[3:13:13] desmo7: BIG C as one of the scar actors Kappa
[3:13:18] desmo7: scare*
[3:13:26] TheVigiliance: What's gonna be towel's version of the hilton bar?
[3:13:40] Dracolich_71: Its much better to charter than to own, they are way more expensive to operate than you might think
[3:13:55] jamarky23: No faction but race change is ok

[3:14:28] BeedleGaming: I wish they will allow none pvp toons to transfer to a pvp server
[3:14:41] GKiDz: wrath was the start of most of it
[3:14:44] trickywalrus__: No they brought faction change, etc in WOTLK
[3:15:00] Wulfgrym: once per month, each toon can only transfer once
[3:15:07] kyousuki21: they do have a limit. 72 hours
[3:15:12] vikingjason: with instant 58 DKS and 80 boosts, fast food mentality kicked in hard during WOTLK
[3:15:17] Merlin840: @Dracolich_71 thats why i said i'd buy the jet and budget for yearly maintenance. with the assumption of $200mill per year income.

[3:15:46] IverCold: @Wulfgrym per 90 days
[3:15:56] vikingjason: HexedZero if they don't gold cap classic, they'll have to charge yo u more for spec-change
[3:15:57] BraerHZ: "for only an extra $5 a month you can have dual spec" LUL
[3:15:58] TheLastRace: Duel spec should have been hand and hand with Arenas
[3:16:03] Zarinna2015: Wrath classic what a joke
[3:16:03] Jedaero: I'd be fine with no dual spec if we could get a seperate pvp spec for arenas
[3:16:03] jamarky23: if the boost is gonna be real then the dual specc is 100 % gonna be real
[3:16:08] GonoFPS: dude im so down for TBC
[3:16:15] Alphabetical13: everyone gonna know al the OP shit tho towerliee
[3:16:17] Amarlian: I can see it. I feel people wanted Classic so they could play the original stuff. People seem to want BC because they liked the expansion and are less hard core about No changes @Towelliee
[3:16:19] larochej: how much does respecking cost in BC?
[3:16:20] GonoFPS: making 3 hunters
[3:16:26] GonoFPS: LUL
[3:16:36] Clicklesly: Respeccing was the same as in vanilla iirc, up to 50g
[3:16:37] vikingjason: I would really love fresh TBC servers
[3:16:37] Mitchendo64: wow tokens for classic coming with wrath classic
[3:16:41] KingAdrock: do you need a 60 first?
[3:16:42] AudioJaq: @alphabetical13 and? That’s what classic was like
[3:16:43] vikingjason: like they did on original launch in 07
[3:16:49] Wcvechten: I mean, china already has the wow token for classic too right?
[3:16:52] WhiteKnight74648: I still want to hear more about this Hammer Squad theme park. :-)
[3:17:03] Alphabetical13: @AudioJaq thats why it sucked and was boring
[3:17:25] Omegacloud: The Boost will enable such hig Bot waves again and again, shit will be funny
[3:17:34] tchiz2711: Will boost happen in prepatch or at launch?
[3:17:36] Scubaskot: @Towelliee the only reason why TBC is going to be more succesfull than classic is solely ARENA, no daily or other stuff, ARENA!
[3:17:39] Desetra: !cam
[3:17:40] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[3:17:40] AudioJaq: @alphabetical13 I hate to break it to you but that’s what classic is gonna be.... you want new play retail
[3:18:03] Mitchendo64: getting that LW up for TBC @Towelliee
[3:18:07] enux337: farming
[3:18:07] Kinghorn: I was tailoring skinning leveling up
[3:18:15] BeedleGaming: getting ready for those drums of war
[3:18:26] IverCold: @Scubaskot not that, just because its the 2nd best expansion in the game. For someone - 1st
[3:18:39] vikingjason: But why would blizzard care, botters/gold farmers gunna be paying through their teeth for subs, and that's all blizz cares about with classic
[3:18:42] 5securi5s: This is a reminder to keep a good posture and hydrate yourself everyone :)
[3:18:49] vikingjason: @Omegacloud
[3:18:49] Kinghorn: it was good gold and some tailoring recipes require leather
[3:18:55] IverCold: @5securi5s ty! nice one!
[3:19:00] Scubaskot: @ZiCold i was refeering about the ability of TBC to retain players
[3:19:07] Merlin840: i still don't think the raids are going to be difficult enough.
[3:19:10] Scubaskot: @ZiCold unlike classic
[3:19:20] enux337: more viable specs
[3:19:24] CatformTV: !beta

[3:19:35] GonoFPS: nice
[3:20:18] Scubaskot: @Towelliee the only reason why TBC is going to be more succesfull than classic is solely ARENA, no dailies or whatnot, ARENA!

[3:20:28] Mecabeast: morning towel arm/grip feeling better?
[3:20:33] Toasty_Chicken: Are you worried about the gold economy going into TBC? seeing people running around with 10, 20 30k gold etc?
[3:20:34] lonelybloody2: anyway we have tons of addons now so its way easier then before
[3:20:35] Tiamattinen: that's kind of a small pull for an aoe mage
[3:20:40] Merlin840: i'll cry when Kael dies first day :'(
[3:20:48] N3llee: there isnt a cap in classic
[3:20:49] vikingjason: Toasty, there's people with maxed gold on multiple toons
[3:21:03] vikingjason: vanilla was never like that

[3:21:30] Mitchendo64: or they bought it
[3:21:35] geokouts: yeah, usually when you get a shot your arm that had it is in pain for a day or two
[3:21:35] krank__tv: plenty of them bought it
[3:21:37] Jedaero: people have millions tho
[3:21:44] GonoFPS: I argued with Towellie about Classic and fast forward a year after he was right
[3:21:52] GonoFPS: same story going on now with TBC
[3:21:58] GonoFPS: chill it's gonna be amazing chat =D
[3:22:05] Raidr211: Sounds like the Dem way of doing things lol
[3:22:12] markmclean24: fuck boosts for classic
[3:22:13] bullymikko: @toasty_chicken, Economics dont work like that
[3:22:18] N3llee: i have 40k gold on classic.. never bought anything. I played the AH
[3:22:22] vikingjason: And you're not going to get an authentic, or close to authentic, TBC experience either if bots/farmers/bug manipulaters are in control of the servers econemy
[3:22:24] Alphabetical13: farming motes lol
[3:22:33] Mecabeast: it'd be like on retail every new expan they wipe your gold
[3:22:38] Mitchendo64: there was a naxx gdkp where someone dropped 108k for ateish. Im sorry if you farmed that much gold you wouldnt blow it on gdkp.
[3:22:43] desmo7: same mentality in retail though, casuals want free epics
[3:22:45] Raidr211: TBC you will make gold fast
[3:22:46] IverCold: @Towelliee Are u one Normal or PVP server?
[3:22:53] retiiful: @Towelliee hey crazy person the devilsaur mafia doesnt exist
[3:22:53] Alphabetical13: wait when are we getting BC like may
[3:23:06] S1appadabass: I will be avoiding all of this while I play Diablo 2, big brain moves
[3:23:12] krank__tv: boosters just gonna buy gold
[3:23:17] enux337: yoink my nodes
[3:23:27] WSquiggle12: @Mitchendo64 Why wouldn't you? ateish is one of the coolest items in the game.
[3:23:42] sarravi: just play mage
[3:23:45] Jedaero: I feel like a lot of the people who want a fresh server just want to be the guy who has the monopoly on the economy
[3:23:46] sarravi: 4Head
[3:24:04] kkz187: @Jedaero true
[3:24:07] Toasty_Chicken: I don't think they should take peoples gold away. I just think they should make a couple of fresh servers. For people that didn't play that much classic.
[3:24:15] vikingjason: I agree toasty
[3:24:24] vikingjason: that would satsify everyone
[3:24:25] Alphabetical13: i cant iwait FOR RMP arenas
[3:24:29] Siraeyou: Actually make it so only boosters allowed kek
[3:24:30] Toasty_Chicken: Cannot see why it's not a win win for everybody.
[3:24:36] Raidr211: What server are you playing TBC on   @Towelliee
[3:24:37] Mitchendo64: @WSquiggle12 do you know how many hours it would take to farm 100k? And its not all of ateish its just whatever drops from that gdkp
[3:24:57] eatonaround: if you are in a good guild not having money isn't a problem too. People help each other out. I get it if you are not in a big/good guild that it'll probably suck. But it is what it will be
[3:24:57] crowz0088: @Towelliee hi man how are you feeling with the 1st shot ?
[3:25:03] PvtHudson093: rich daddy Towelliee is going to give us a joining bonus
[3:25:08] tchiz2711: Is it confirmed that boost will be available in prepatch?
[3:25:09] Kahoolo: @Raidr211 Azuresong
[3:25:10] wadethewaters: Why would we have fresh servers? Was there fresh servers when Vanilla transitioned into TBC? no
[3:25:21] Epicsapphire1988: @Raidr211 Azuresong
[3:25:23] vikingjason: yes there was Wade
[3:25:26] sifer007: people want a covid19 free server
[3:25:27] Raidr211: Thx @Kahoolo
[3:25:29] vikingjason: they released fresh TBC servers
[3:25:34] Mitchendo64: so its safe to assume hes dropping 100k a week for ateish
[3:25:42] markmclean24: its fine
[3:25:48] markmclean24: just go pservers
[3:25:54] vikingjason: I played nagrand near after it's release.
[3:25:55] zenFX_: @wadethewaters there actually was fresh TBC servers though
[3:26:04] Alphabetical13: when we get wrath
[3:26:09] Mecabeast: I wouldn't mind seeing vanilla servers that launch with all content and the server wipes and starts over like every 6mos
[3:26:17] metavahn231: im for choice always, so im for fresh
[3:26:22] vikingjason: Yes i agree, fresh Vanilla servers would be awesome too
[3:26:23] sKINDRED88: !tbc
[3:26:24] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[3:26:28] WSquiggle12: @Mitchendo64 maybe those were the last splinters they needed? The whole point of having gold is to spend it. No reason to horde it. When you have so much gold it doesn't matter how much you spend.
[3:26:31] Genilort: wrath is my fav expansion, it will explode
[3:26:32] metavahn231: but i can see why raiding guilds would hate fresh servers
[3:26:35] wadethewaters: @zenFX_ They made additonal servers because they were running at max capacity they werent labelled as  "fresh servers"
[3:26:37] Sollice: @towelliee Just ordered my DT 770 pros. hopefully they are good
[3:26:48] Ranger208: They don't need to make fresh servers at launch only to have them become empty after a few months.
[3:26:50] wadethewaters: @zenFX_ its the same outcome, but a different concept
[3:27:01] Genilort: northrend zones was so nice
[3:27:05] Theduskflyer: Just do a gold wipe. Like 250-500 gold Max going into BC.
[3:27:10] mett7: dont worry, they will make classic fresh start servers, EZ money
[3:27:22] Broomba: Wtf gold wipes?
[3:27:35] Broomba: That makes no sense
[3:27:41] Mitchendo64: @WSquiggle12 Last or just starting, theyre dropping 100k a week (assuming) in gdkp for the staff, which is impossible to farm that much in 1 week.
[3:27:43] trickywalrus__: do you think a lot of people will leave retail for Classic WOTLK / TBC ?
[3:27:43] wadethewaters: @Theduskflyer so all of my 50k gold i farmed legitimately on my rogue should be wiped? lol
[3:27:55] Genilort: @itrickywalrusx yes
[3:27:58] TheUnknowing: yeah but thats unfair @Theduskflyer
[3:27:58] markmclean24: All they want is money
[3:28:05] sarravi: till 9.1 prob
[3:28:06] Raidr211: They will just combine low pop servers
[3:28:06] metavahn231: consolidate the dead servers
[3:28:07] Mitchendo64: @WSquiggle12 if he was in a guild that cleared naxx he wouldnt be in a naxx gdkp
[3:28:08] PaladinNynx: Gold wipes never happned before and wont happen now
[3:28:10] vikingjason: I don't think a complete wipe would be fair, but a gold is needed
[3:28:11] pseudo75: Sadge
[3:28:18] Genilort: wotlk have better pvp and pve in my opinion
[3:28:19] vikingjason: gold cap
[3:28:20] sarravi: i joined a mythic raiding guild so i have plenty to do till 9.1 lol
[3:28:23] othraerir: heh

[3:28:25] kirshoxd: imagine WoD classic monkaS
[3:28:25] N3llee: @Towelliee its already happening.. I'm on Stalagg and of the 6 guilds still raiding 3 just xfer'd off in prep for bc
[3:28:25] dracullus: end of summer, sure
[3:28:26] Kromede: D:
[3:28:29] wadethewaters: there wasnt a gold wipe in vanilla>TBC, why would there be a gold wipe now lol
[3:28:31] Shamwise: Sounds extreme..but ok
[3:28:36] trickywalrus__: Big agree
[3:28:37] balanira: anyone knows if leveling is faster in wrath ? i want to play wrath but i have no interest in leveling in classic/tbc
[3:28:39] toxic_suede: well how about 10% monthly tax.... Hehehe
[3:28:47] PvtHudson093: had enough of that and Nya
[3:28:50] Pippinn: @Towelliee did yall finally get sire?
[3:28:52] PaladinNynx: gold cap was never needed i entered bc with 1500 back in the day who cares how much people have now
[3:28:52] Kromede: so, same procedure as every raid Kappa
[3:28:56] CritcobainTV: I was watching another streamer and i was talking about how blizz is talking about possibly doing a wow token for classic, and the guy was like "whoever told you that doesn't know what the hell they're talking about" and i was like "frick you m8"
[3:29:01] Broomba: Gold cap lol players asking for mikes in change when blizzard gives us an inch
[3:29:02] vikingjason: but it's diffrent now to then @wadethewaters

[3:29:14] wadethewaters: @nynx113 yeah, theres always going to be someone with more gold, its unavoidable
[3:29:15] dracullus: @Towelliee where you get this? end of summer is 6 months away, ptr usually last 2-2.5 months
[3:29:15] othraerir: what % did you get danny donut to?
[3:29:23] metavahn231: the whole point of these classic era servers is  a fresh start, it would be pretty silly of them not to have actual fresh servers for  each one they do

[3:29:29] sliizew: btw, you wanna kill the ones called hippogryph for the feathers
[3:29:32] Genilort: their will be 68 boost problably so
[3:29:38] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[3:29:43] wadethewaters: @vikingjason yea its different, but i just dont see how a gold wipe will solve anything, people will just make the same amount of gold all over again, and faster, because its TBC
[3:29:45] Kromede: and my KappaPride
[3:29:49] vikingjason: in 2006 people wasn't sitting on 250k on multiple toons and if they don't change anything, it'll have an adverse effect on TBC econemy from the very start and potentionaly ruin the game for many people.
[3:29:50] PaladinNynx: i had my gm with max gold in tbc knwo what he did ..he bought me flying and many other as well
[3:30:00] TheGaoSora: YUUUUP
[3:30:04] Mitchendo64: bro blizzard will eventually do a wow token for classic to get into that gold buying
[3:30:08] CritcobainTV: All this crying they're doing, we still need #SomeChanges cause their diapers are full FeelsBadMan
[3:30:11] QuantumDelta: gold wipes wont fix a damn thing, it'll just break it even more lol
[3:30:12] TheGaoSora: classic is all they know, retail is too much for them

[3:30:17] GonoFPS: LUL
[3:30:18] trivwik: We got the corruption power version of Classic.
[3:30:25] markmclean24: cause they make blizzard money
[3:30:28] Kromede: at least it's way better than RIFTs try at "classic"
[3:30:36] S1appadabass: I think blizzard should be using this as an opportunity to put a new spin on an old game
[3:30:42] Matuidie92: and stream?
[3:30:49] Omegacloud: Nothing gonna change. Trust me you only gonna see Druids flying around and stealing your shit. Bots Bots Bots nothing more
[3:30:55] tchiz2711: I’m on pagle and it’s gonna be awful at launch
[3:30:56] kirshoxd: true
[3:31:03] cabalish: @Towelliee u get the feathers in feralas or the hinterlands
[3:31:13] Amarlian: I am not the same person in the same situations as I was in when WOW came out. It was never going to be a classic experience. @Towelliee
[3:31:19] plumpus81: they are low drop rate
[3:31:25] plumpus81: i got my feathers in azshara
[3:31:32] Pippinn: @Towelliee did yall kill sire last night?
[3:31:40] cabalish: 26 % droprate
[3:31:40] BeedleGaming: your unlucky
[3:31:51] Tharia: drop rates are generally a pita
[3:32:05] CritcobainTV: Mmm pita bread
[3:32:12] Tharia: 😆
[3:32:17] vikingjason: Yes because in 2006 people was solo farming raids using broken mage mechanics. Kekw
[3:32:21] Genilort: wotlk have the best mana pool. in classic you dry out of mana in 1 sec
[3:32:37] Kromede: "thought" KEKW
[3:32:46] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee They ask for No changes but dont realize that they as gamers have changed...
[3:32:51] GrAiNGrInDeR: What are the main BC changes? just the server moving stuff?
[3:32:59] Mecabeast: 3 words, rose tinted glasses
[3:33:04] CritcobainTV: 500g KEKW
[3:33:07] HolyBawls: Do you think they bring tokens to TBC?
[3:33:18] Genilort: no
[3:33:21] tchiz2711: Private server folks can’t talk about fresh servers when private servers have things like 8 times leveling
[3:33:27] Tharia: man I need to start my gold farming
[3:33:41] vikingjason: Belf/Ally paladins can alternate seals at lvl 70 @GrAiNGrInDeR
[3:33:42] wadethewaters: @tchiz2711 most of the Vanilla pservers have always been x1 exp btw

[3:34:19] Genilort: but tokens will make gold worthless
[3:34:22] Mitchendo64: Didnt wow tokens kill the gold selling in retail? @Towelliee
[3:34:32] PadidinJones: The only disadvantage botters have in classic is there is no longboi to sell their shit quick
[3:34:53] tchiz2711: @wadethewaters I get for classic. But for tbc it would be awful. I wouldn’t want to start 1-60 before doing tbc content
[3:34:58] Joryckfree: The only thing I dont agree with is the level boost the rest of the changes are really good
[3:35:05] Mitchendo64: yea its only a matter of time before wow tokens for classic come out
[3:35:14] pemadsen17: the multiboxing penalties in retail helped the botting situation a lot as well
[3:35:14] majinmeww: It may remove some of the bots but there’s even bots in retail and they sell retail gold and RMT
[3:35:18] enux337: all druids too
[3:35:22] EggwithEdges: Epic flying bot dr00d
[3:35:23] Mitchendo64: thats too much profit potential for blizzard to pass up
[3:35:27] Ranger208: swift flight form will become the bane of playerbase
[3:35:39] secondarych: please blizzard add token to TBC :(
[3:35:48] vikingjason: Classic/TBC still valued the leveling part of the game that I personally really enjoy. It's retail mentality that the game starts at 60/70 and everything before is pointless
[3:35:50] N3llee: it would do what it did in retail.. not stop it but minimalize it.
[3:35:54] othraerir: people won't buy if they can get it themselves more easily
[3:35:55] Mitchendo64: I say wow token comes out with wrath classic
[3:36:02] mulletrocker11358: BOT FISHING GOLDEN DARTER LAWL

[3:37:01] Rexialiton: KEKW
[3:37:03] robertjordan83: @Towelliee i think everyone is overvaluing the value of leveling in a tbc classic, its not vanilla, people want to be play tbc at this point @vikingjason
[3:37:06] SlapaH03: hardware id ban

[3:37:16] GonoFPS: bots pay for boosts on new bots. Lots of young bots in trainning out there
[3:37:22] PaladinNynx: @vikingjason  that is true TBC added new areas in vanilla zones and more items..better items and faster lvling that world is what i will lvl my beartank thru

[3:37:25] QuantumDelta: I think nodes + tokens will help a little bit vs bots initially but all that'll happen is instances will be filled with paladins to generate raw gold instead of stuff to sell for gold
[3:37:46] Ablackdruid: yeah but still
[3:37:51] metavahn231: token is such a greedy way to fix the problem
[3:38:08] Mitchendo64: MrDestructoid
[3:38:10] N3llee: @Towelliee it also doesnt help that several countries currency is worth so little that WoW gold is more valuable.
[3:38:19] fully804: fully804 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! Hammers up my dude

[3:38:53] Ablackdruid: yeah......but still
[3:38:55] QuantumDelta: EVE Online had the first token right? PLEX?
[3:39:01] Mitchendo64: @Veramer reliable way to fix the problem though

[3:39:11] toxic_suede: @robertjordan83 In referece to the wheel of time?
[3:39:12] keyserv: aren't those all f2p games?

[3:40:43] toxic_suede: @robertjordan83 the writer was robert jordan... I am too old to understand sometimes.
[3:40:51] Genilort: coulndnt they make like valorant software which needs to be activated to play?
[3:40:51] Mitchendo64: Just keep the community aspect of classic and they change as much as they want for all i care.
[3:41:00] Mitchendo64: they can change*
[3:41:00] magemaster225: still not even gonna pay the players either lol
[3:41:02] xAshleyCyanidex: Yep
[3:41:14] Cielos: Blizzard was way late to Esports, so it doesn't surprise me it's not that popular. Plus, their rewards were bad compared to other leagues.
[3:41:18] brain_wash: the players already said the Blizz Arena is what made it good
[3:41:19] enux337: yep them events cost money
[3:41:23] vikingjason: Anyway, i just hope they release atleast a couple fresh servers, so the few of us can enjoy a close to real TBC experience, then those want that private server experience.
[3:41:27] Sygfreid: Sounds like they're taking the LoL approach.
[3:41:34] Mitchendo64: wait what are they doing in OWL?
[3:41:38] Brandonhipster: Yeah Activision is laying off people while making profit.
[3:41:46] Nottinghams: i think most are actual people gold/mat farming. Any automation or botting is pretty much instant ban
[3:41:46] QuantumDelta: I think homestands were a major issue for some teams
[3:41:51] mett7: i think OW league was failer for blizz, they probably count for way more
[3:42:01] PaladinNynx: I hope that fresh is an option it does not hurt me in anyway
[3:42:02] robertjordan83: @toxic_svensk yes i know the famous fantasy writer, but the name is also the main character in hemmingway's for whom the bell tolls
[3:42:10] bullymikko: Ow is too complicated game for casuals to watch
[3:42:16] ArcaneSyntax: we won't even be able to have live events until next year.
[3:42:17] jackjonesiii: riot games is taking over
[3:42:18] Mitchendo64: OWL was fun to watch for the 1st season...
[3:42:27] Sygfreid: OW2 is probably their last chance to revitalize it.  Whenever it releaes.
[3:42:45] headshotb1lly: maybe if their CEO took some of that nice 200m takehome bonus and put sometthing into esports they could do something

[3:43:41] ArcaneSyntax: boosting for gold is fine, boosting for $ is not.
[3:43:46] Mitchendo64: I love gdkp even the 30g payouts. it brings a nice roleplay immersion to the game. Go Raid, and hang out in the tavern spreading the treasure afterwards.

[3:44:15] deedeemegadoodooo: I dont get why people shit on boosting. just a way to make gold
[3:44:16] raldrik: your quest shows done

[3:44:48] Wildside1177: People confuse not liking something with that something causing a problem. Boosts cause no problems.
[3:44:51] sliizew: they drop of the ones called HIPPOGRYPH, nothing else
[3:44:54] Bixster: When player boost for gold its a crime, but its not different then boosting an old friend through content.
[3:44:55] vikingjason: With no go gold cap to TBC who really cares about gold or the econemy, just look at retail. That's the path we'll all be taking
[3:45:03] kamisengames: @magemaster225 How do you propose you let other players know you are provind  boosts if you prevent advertising, you make no sense. It is not something that blizz will regulate.

[3:46:07] TheGaoSora: Goblins and Multiboxers yup
[3:46:10] Mitchendo64: my only issue is that legit ways of farming gold cant keep up with the prices of raiding consumables at this point thanks to the gold selling @Towelliee

[3:46:20] MrEvilRex: Yes Towelliee you tell em, with your SWTOR undercutting ways
[3:46:24] ArcaneSyntax: im not even sure a goog economy is even possible in a game like world of warcraft.
[3:46:25] toxic_suede: it'll always have loopholes.

[3:46:47] swordwindgaming: stopping boosting only works if you're trying to gatekeep baddies out of the end game, but there are too many baddies in the player base for boost bans to make a difference

[3:57:58] nargathronic: I don't understand the rush with TBC. It is better to wait until everything is ready and get a good version, than rush a bad version to keep the time schedule.
[3:58:12] Kromede: check the ladies PrideLion
[3:58:21] dracullus: @LadyCadance 9.1 for late Q2 and TBC month-two later would make most sense

[5:11:37] jiffynuts: @Towelliee the cut was great, better cohesive story.  Yea there's things that could have been left on teh cutting floor, but think of it as the director's cut of the theatrical version we never originally saw
[5:11:40] Digitree: technically, 3.5 hours of it is new.
[5:11:43] im_n0t_jezus: its not meant to be on cinema or anything just HBO max
