[1:23:14] Scraggersmeh: If 9.2 takes 7 months to come out, the good thing is that it might be a short turn around between 9.2 and 10.0

There are bigger issues than a tree being burnt down with people, gee, i dunno maybe a "PLANET" of trillions is at steak and Sylvanas is the KEY to know what The Jailers next move is. If anything, she's a valueable Ally to the Alliance right now.

[1:38:48] feelingthis2020: I find it shocking how I was running this dungeon around Christmas when I actually played retail. No wonder they have trouble retaining players. You do the content & leave
[1:39:00] Mitchendo64: @I_DoctorSatan_I I'm baffled by how quickly you got mad and defensive. All I said was becoming the Lich Queen makes the most sense. She gets rewarded with immortality like she wants, but also gets imprisoned to be the Jailer of the Scourge which is needed to keep the Scourge in check. Best of both worlds for the players.

[1:56:10] Jimbobaus: @towelliee I am pretty sure renown drops stop once you reach previous weeks cap. Last week cap was 42 yeah? So won’t drop now. You need to earn it the usual way.
[1:56:12] chipmonkings: Renown cap - 45

[1:58:42] The_Tank_Man_X: @Mitchendo I played last year and it's what I imagined Runescape looked like when I first heard about it as a kid. It has a special draw to me
[1:59:36] Ziephier: I still have farms on Archeage but do not pvp
[1:59:47] Mitchendo64: @Bullyloaded Id want to play simply for the scenery. I thought it was a very beautiful game.
[2:00:17] Ziephier: when I heard you can loose your farm you build I lost interest
[2:00:40] ExBell: do those glasses actually help out with eye strain?
[2:01:25] FutileDiploma: @towelliee how does sword legend look. Haven’t heard much about it
[2:01:31] Mitchendo64: rpgs dont make the best pvp games anyways

[2:02:22] Ziephier: I play BDO too but try not to pvp as my left hand becomes rubber and my fingers just lead a life of their own
[2:02:22] The_Tank_Man_X: @Mitchendo I'll 100% get my money's worth and then some based off of the mass amount of hours I racked up last year. I'm just hoping for it to go all the way!

[2:19:10] tydrennistv: but the 5 button rotation and the mechanic with how combat was was amazing. best combat i have ever seen in a mmo wildstar was a pioneer of that combat
[2:19:12] kokochris: yup they tweaked it

[2:29:24] JonnyScotland: the one on the south island
[2:29:24] mavericks312: but how much attention will it have once the free 60 days stop and the mount special
[2:29:56] CADZtv: i dont think thats the case at all i just dont think people like watching it compared to wow
[2:30:17] datcreepa: get the quest item
[2:30:19] jaihillyy: guarantee 60-70% of their surge is the free trial thing xD
[2:30:20] izdouble: annie is about to hit heavensward
[2:30:21] MeZorZ: Cohh Carnage isnt 50 yet
[2:30:21] Broomba: asmon is 42
[2:30:26] Moronil: I mean, I'm still grinding all FFXIV relics and the new zones added in patch 5.5 LUL
[2:30:28] MeZorZ: hes like 45
[2:30:32] rozurial1987: cohjh is palying ya
[2:30:34] Sonatta: the crazy thing about FF14 is Dan hasn't started yet.. when he does... so many fresh eyes are going to be on that game DansGame
[2:30:47] azzurrin: I think the MSQ is boring towatch, but after that it's basically like WoW w/o PvP
[2:30:50] Wildside1177: Cohh was a charity goal.
[2:30:51] Mitchendo64: even soda poppin was asking bout FF14
[2:31:03] MeZorZ: Time to make a new TOon!
[2:31:11] Broomba: @Mitchendo soda was asking about ff14 pvp
[2:31:12] sarravi: charity goal = playing it tho right
[2:31:23] jaihillyy: one thing I really like about FF14 is that one character can be anything
[2:31:24] rozurial1987: rozurial1987 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:31:26] mainetrev: as someone whos never played, but played wow since launch, im genuinely having a lot of fun
[2:31:28] Sonatta: i saw Staysafe is on the FF14 train too
[2:31:33] Moronil: I switch a lot between wow and FF patches
[2:32:03] JonnyScotland: People keep killing it before he reaches 40 stacks in the EU, it's frustrating
[2:32:09] Catspaw66: @Towelliee quick bear question. Do you cat shift at all or different build? cheers.
[2:32:34] Catspaw66: ahh cheers Towelliee ;-)
[2:32:37] CADZtv: @Mitchendo yh but soda wont touch final cause pvp

[2:32:52] Mitchendo64: still though
[2:32:58] I_Sowercrowd_I: !sylvanas
[2:32:58] Moobot: @I_Sowercrowd_I No, Towelliee has not seen the Sylvanas cutscene yet. He is waiting until he actually beats the raid to watch it.
[2:33:01] CADZtv: reason why summit stopped playing final
[2:33:28] CADZtv: final wouldve had summit and soda playing it if the pvp was better

[2:33:59] Sonatta: nope all the "new" MMOs are spiritual successors and throwback mmos
[2:34:55] Xailen: the only thing that can kill WoW will be itself imploding
[2:34:58] rozurial1987: ya endwalker is gonna be huge hope they keep it going
[2:34:59] Catspaw66: does new world with that amazon money have a chance to be amazing ?
[2:35:14] JonnyScotland: easier to hype an expansion than a patch imo
[2:35:16] CADZtv: yh just let asmon carry the final directory KEKW
[2:35:23] Sonatta: that XP earring in the Endwalkers Preorder is also great for leveling a new job :)
[2:35:41] Fatality4400: !Sylvanas
[2:35:41] Moobot: @Fatality4400 No, Towelliee has not seen the Sylvanas cutscene yet. He is waiting until he actually beats the raid to watch it.

[2:37:23] thedr8993: reap what you sow
[2:37:26] toobaked1987: I couldnt imagine reading what people say in his chat on the daily. He has formed such a toxic community, good for him.
[2:37:30] mavericks312: i dont think it matters what game that guy plays
[2:37:52] loki2k18: wow fanboys get butthurt
[2:38:24] JonnyScotland: @loki2k18 could say the same about anything. Everything has fans like that
[2:38:46] ohnot___her: I disagree I think asmon was having a good time today in that dungeon
[2:38:49] Sonatta: he seemed pretty turned off during the Call In stream with Rich too
[2:38:57] shimwood: The worst is when people intentionally try to wipe the dungeon/raid for "content"
[2:39:03] mlloading: esfandCozy

[2:40:43] ShrenTheOrc: it sucked that rich kept mentioning FF14 too aoc creator
[2:40:51] JonnyScotland: I logged in game later and had someone telling me to do you know what

[8:09:04] D3m0nHunt3r666: perfect time to take a break and not stress about it Kappa
[8:09:10] BrunoArmond: a lot of hate and all about sylvanas "end" and sht
[8:09:14] valarbravoosi: KT first week was a lil rough wasn't it?

[8:11:18] mmrghost7: i want sylvanas and arthas to marry
[8:11:26] BrunoArmond: like, i dont have hate about it... but i tought she deserved more? i dont know hahaha
[8:11:33] Arctoresque: lol
[8:11:33] romanovlover14: before you stand in on in a raid at least 4 blues 2 purple
[8:11:42] Kisswani: I think many of the complaints were from ppl who started wanting to hate on something and started from there for whateveer reason
[8:11:45] Moiste: the only part that didnt make sense to me is why did sylvanas not even think the jailer might betray her? she's supposed to be a master tactician or something
[8:11:45] generalmarcus35: TOUGH SHIT
[8:11:50] Kindr1d: did they kill fatescribe?

[8:12:51] Tcrane_: imagen her fleeing to an alternate timeline POGGERS
[8:12:55] tdpark_: I am disappointed because we dont know whats next
[8:12:57] Moiste: i think it's okay for her to have a redemption arc as long as she has some sort of punishment for ya know, genocide
[8:13:05] BrunoArmond: LOL
[8:13:06] valarbravoosi: YEP
[8:13:08] gwar234: well fuck that was vanilla
