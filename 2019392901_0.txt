[4:19:25] LayWastedd: @gibberish16, jeeps are only popular with jeep people / outdoors people
[4:19:27] pashun__: Supra prob has better handling since the chassis is made by BMW
[4:19:35] mba99_: toyota corolla gr is what im tryna get rn
[4:19:41] LayWastedd: supra is faster on track and in a straight line than the Z
[4:19:44] thebman1981: I was reading that they are having problems selling truck because of the cost from the big three
[4:19:58] LayWastedd: gr corolla has some major design flaws too with the differential
[4:20:06] ZanCrow94: Except its awd
[4:20:15] gibberish16: @LayWastedd that's fair. i don't even get to do the jeep wave with it
[4:20:16] LayWastedd: Gr is our last hope for affordable sports cars
[4:20:35] GavinMazey: I think the z is marketed wrong. People think it's a sports car but it really is a grand touring car
[4:20:59] PocketCrab: I love my slow car lol
[4:21:01] LayWastedd: GR 86 is a solid platform for sure
[4:21:03] LayWastedd: good for learning

[4:21:42] LayWastedd: yeah good luck on r34s KEKW people asking 200k for them
[4:21:45] pashun__: We just need to tough out the down cycle of the economy and wait for the economy to recover
[4:22:00] PocketCrab: Do it you wont wawaKekw
[4:22:10] Climactics: supra instead, gr86s dont hold as well
[4:22:12] LayWastedd: yeah mine seemed to hold decent value
[4:22:17] Starwinpikachu: get a Prius do it you won‚Äôt wawaKekw
[4:22:21] LayWastedd: its not gonna hold its value like a type R
[4:22:24] thebman1981: I would guess no
[4:22:27] LayWastedd: but wont drop as fast as normal car
[4:22:28] GavinMazey: Better than most but not as good as a true toyota

[4:23:03] LayWastedd: dealer offered 25k last weekend when i went to see that fk8
[4:23:05] Phinks__: I would get the GR86 used for sure. like 1 or 2 years old. saves you the initial depreciation
[4:23:15] pashun__: I like the previous gen M2 better, more beautiful imo
[4:23:24] gritz_n_pitz: M4 is nice too
[4:23:34] LayWastedd: 2018 with factory brembos and suspension upgrade

[4:24:08] K1N_: how you been
[4:24:10] GavinMazey: @phinks__ that's the kinda car that is a lil scary to buy used cuz people beat on them. And the boxer engine needs special care
[4:24:31] Climactics: i'd say just get 86, and then trade in for m2 later SeemsGood
[4:24:33] K1N_: hell yeah dude happy new year gonna have u on the second monitor as i arena it up
[4:24:35] TodoGuts: Isn't the new GR86 from 2023?

[4:50:41] watsupyouguys: @nosidestep jnbCOOL
[4:50:49] Landy: The March 11, 2011 earthquake generated a tsunami with a maximum wave height of almost 40 meters (130 feet) in the Iwate Prefecture
[4:50:51] TodoGuts: 5 meters is not incredibly high but it's 1.5 times the height of my bedroom's ceiling

[4:51:41] number32nlb: aftershocks can strengthen the tsunami
[4:51:44] Nosidestep: it‚Äôs barely 2024 and nature is already acting up
[4:51:45] Dethrey: try to escape or get to a cemement parking lot taht is 5 stories or taller or sky scrapper
