[0:37:38] alexxheartless: dumb question but if you wipe on the first boss or something and want to leave the dungeon to restart, does that count as a depletion or can you just rerun the same level key?
[0:37:57] dithrica: @alexxheartless depleted
[0:38:46] alexxheartless: so theres no way to practice specific packs at a certain key level?

[1:10:33] Jemba: KEKW
[1:11:11] Guffels: @WoMpWoMp33 why shouldnt they leverage the 20 years of content they already spent time on?
[1:11:45] brandon_bop: Ohh do the Juggernauts target the mirror images?
