[1:42:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they might have made the abomination limb animation like that because players called it "slappy hands"

[1:47:19] al_capow: the only thing I'm dreading about leveling is horde after barrens kinda sucks lol
[1:47:20] Pwnyo808: that a BM hunter wants to swap targets a whole shit ton, into a lobby with an aff lock?
[1:47:25] al_capow: until feralas anyway
[1:47:26] Pwnyo808: and lets the aff lock spam damage
[1:47:40] Pwnyo808: and then i whisper to tell them that if we go lock we can mitigate damage, and dude gets all mad
[1:47:41] Pwnyo808: lol

[2:59:22] Neriakied: it should on paper
[2:59:28] todesfausttv: where do you get that weed
[2:59:41] chachio_dk: if we were more tanky. but we’re made of paper these days
[3:00:10] krome2dadome: could u even argue that any melee counters any caster nowadays?
[3:00:16] callmekill91: maybe u guys r supposed to go dragon or druid with no trinket with full sweep and strang up. and thats a maybe after youve gotten rescue from devo
[3:01:22] chachio_dk: lol what ams
[3:01:30] callmekill91: just deleted
[3:01:44] callmekill91: had eternity surge inc as soon as shell fell.
[3:02:12] chachio_dk: dragon prob plays unravel exclusively for dk
[3:02:21] callmekill91: hm, just rdruid then with grip ? and sweep/strang combo with no trinket. i know they can kinda peel but
[3:02:44] callmekill91: ww/dk dam to rdruid is gross
[3:02:49] BasicSnake: wait, does unravel work on shell?

[3:03:17] Schnitzelmaker007: How is dk after the nerf? @notmes
[3:03:36] callmekill91: well u dont go druid all the time right, just with no trinket and sweep/strang
[3:03:44] callmekill91: like  a swap after training mage?
[3:03:45] Neriakied: the arcane doing 130k dps being trained
[3:04:00] callmekill91: yall had trinkets not going druid those game
[3:04:01] Schnitzelmaker007: By cross cc
[3:04:05] callmekill91: like that clip u just played
[3:04:07] chachio_dk: seems like if you put one grip into the druid you will never touch the mage again
[3:04:08] callmekill91: no one had trinkets
[3:04:15] flixbus1234: Nice ui bro
[3:04:23] callmekill91: im not sure from just the death clip
[3:04:40] Schnitzelmaker007: @notmes how does dk feel after the nerf?
[3:04:44] callmekill91: im not saying thats the full strat
[3:04:52] callmekill91: but just theory crafting cause WW/DK damage
[3:05:17] callmekill91: but u wont have grip i dont think
[3:05:24] callmekill91: unless you intentionally save it
[3:05:42] chachio_dk: how does ur guys boomy/sub do into that

[4:39:27] atoker: @mouro52 anything you can get
[4:39:28] callmekill91: ya only getting about 60ks at highest but my death coil hit for 118k
[4:39:33] mouro52: Oh I see ty
[4:39:40] callmekill91: im curious how much it affects clawing damage since its also shadow
[4:40:04] ianryan306: my coils were doing 108k with clawing build and 74% mastery
[4:42:05] callmekill91: naw clawing is fucking ripping im not gonna lie
[4:42:09] dawsonator171: I like the on use for goes so my crit is pretty high.
[4:42:14] happyheals: I felt like there was a dh in that match at somepoint
[4:42:35] callmekill91: avg claw is 80-115k
[4:42:46] callmekill91: ye
[4:42:55] hyttzdrag: kronk: when Alexander graham bell invented the telephone he had two missed calls from chuck norris
[4:42:56] dawsonator171: 19% crit. 9% haste 80% mastery and 29% vers.
[4:43:14] ianryan306: that sounds like a doomburst claw @ 115k
[4:43:23] ianryan306: haste is better than crit imo as unholy
[4:44:05] ianryan306: dawson thats gotta be in arena right not normal
[4:44:11] dawsonator171: I have leggo 4p and on use. my crit is absurd.
[4:44:38] dawsonator171: gloves are my offpiece. I didn't get them as tier.
[4:44:48] callmekill91: yeah during UA, i hit 147-147-157-157 all non crit clawings on dummy
[4:44:58] callmekill91: thats 400k dam after apoc burst
[4:45:26] ianryan306: does that include bursting a wound with each one or nah
[4:45:36] vuldronx: my friendship with haste has ended, crit is now my best friend
[4:45:40] brindleindle: Just dropped nearly 100 rating in two lobbies on my hunter
[4:46:06] bdipump: so only 2 set now ??
[4:46:39] callmekill91: it doesnt include the wouind im popping thats just the claw
[4:46:42] magentura: which addon shows buffs/debuffs on nameplate?
[4:47:13] callmekill91: but wounds are only 23-31k on the log
[4:47:39] callmekill91: but thats an extra 100k+ during that 400k clawing window
[4:48:42] callmekill91: i cant seem to get my wound damge with defile higher than 60k a pop tho
[4:48:44] bdipump: just 2 set to get more mastery ?
[4:48:51] Yoskexz: will u be makin the plate helm emb?
[4:49:18] rautaxd: Are you removing the reaping talent when hitting the dummy? Having the dummy in execute range will sku your numbers

[5:09:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1.25m health
[5:11:12] happyheals: if it has stats you need
[5:11:25] Zerochillzxd: do we have to run more vers now?
[5:12:53] happyheals: if you lost armor and it feels off to you now, then more vers is a good

[5:17:51] happyheals: Goodbye Dawson, I hope you get the most well deserved sleep and may other accounts not keep you up
[5:19:30] Blaze150000: Hey mes will u still stream in 1-2 h
[5:19:44] callmekill91: out dmging DH seems alright ngl
[5:19:47] callmekill91: u should never do that
[5:19:47] Blaze150000: Nice !!
[5:21:08] callmekill91: and its bursting wounds not ebon fever right
[5:21:43] callmekill91: lets see it lord mes
[5:23:16] Jp_3rd: is he still doing full mastery?
[5:25:26] callmekill91: LMFAOOOOO
[5:25:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ clap
[5:25:44] callmekill91: 6m damage
[5:26:00] callmekill91: 17.8% overall
[5:26:05] callmekill91: idk
[5:26:49] crusadein: what is with that haste??
[5:27:20] callmekill91: gonna literally be a sub rog, all mastery 0 haste
[5:28:06] crusadein: @callmekill91 would if we had 1 sec globals like rogues
[5:28:08] happyheals: druid gives 3%
[5:28:16] waitimdesyncd: the quest for 66% vers KEKW Kappa
[5:28:21] Vademiica: is gladiator's emblem worth it over haste trinket for a bit more tankiness?
[5:28:30] happyheals: 69% vers or bust
[5:28:32] wardelswijk: 30% after :D
[5:28:40] Jp_3rd: oh nice
[5:28:42] wardelswijk: y i think so
[5:28:48] Antiquasar: tbh i doubt youd get many more globals per min with 4% haste vs like 15%
[5:29:19] shugguls: so not stacking vers now?
[5:29:39] waitimdesyncd: is it worth it getting engineering items with ONLY vers and no second stat? KEKW
[5:29:52] happyheals: as long as you are having fun, be the best you
[5:30:24] waitimdesyncd: yeah in theory if you have 90% vers, and you get another 5% vers then thats effectively 50% dam reduc
[5:31:49] happyheals: https://www.wowhead.com/guide/diminishing-returns-on-secondary-stats-in-world-of-warcraft
[5:31:51] shugguls: thinking of stacking it on my war to 40%
[5:32:16] waitimdesyncd: anyone know if it is possible to get ONLY VERS on the crafted engineering items?
[5:33:01] happyheals: yes i believe
[5:33:01] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:33:05] wardelswijk: it is
[5:33:14] wardelswijk: but full vers is not great either
[5:33:36] goatskull123: did you try soul reaper with the low haste?
[5:35:14] wardelswijk: Mes means knife in my country ;D
[5:35:55] sillysheepweepandsleep: is this viewer 2s
[5:36:08] Antiquasar: Haste 17.82%  Global 1.27  Globals per min 47   Haste 6.47%  Global 1.41  Globals per min 42
[5:36:27] Antiquasar: but the mastery and verse gain is massive
[5:36:52] callmekill91: ngl this feels way better
[5:36:55] callmekill91: been testing it a bit myself
[5:36:59] callmekill91: i feel way tankier
[5:37:07] waitimdesyncd: Empower and defile can be good ways of getting haste if you find out it is needewd anyway, though empower isnt big value
[5:38:57] Antiquasar: I just did it on my character by dropping my haste i cant get up that high
[5:39:32] Antiquasar: I dont know how gcd is affected by haste if its linea or not

[5:40:59] xseba02: did you got the legendary?
[5:41:14] xseba02: damn
[5:41:16] xseba02: sadge
[5:41:35] Antiquasar: You could do it really easy if you've got your old gear, download DejaCharacterStats and will show you your GCD so you could compare your mastery and gcd difference between the loadouts
[5:42:00] waitimdesyncd: @Antiquasar  smart
[5:42:08] callmekill91: ya we just made and bought new gear to test this
[5:42:16] waitimdesyncd: @Antiquasar  youre our twitch-chatgpt
[5:42:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boom
[5:43:22] bdipump: is their conq boxes ?
[5:43:33] callmekill91: ye
[5:43:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yes conquest boxes are available now and the conquest cap was lifted, and there is a spoils of war bonus in effect
[5:44:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: People can go full throttle on gearing, pretty sweet
[5:44:23] bdipump: @wEiRdO_dUdE ty my friend
[5:44:48] bdipump: do we got alot of time in the season left still i just came back literally last week
[5:45:00] callmekill91: like 2 months maybe 3
[5:45:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there is still time before season 4
[5:46:20] waitimdesyncd: @bdipump  yeah you still have ages to play this season, dont sweat it and enjoy the fun!
[5:46:41] bdipump: ty all
[5:47:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Patch 10.2.5 just came out about 9 days ago, and there is going to be a mysterious patch  10.2.6 before season 4 launches
[5:47:48] dipset89: dk look like shit now
[5:47:50] avenueone: whats this damage difference*
[5:48:39] waitimdesyncd: KEKW maybe zombies  could help stop war a big from going to town Kappa
[5:48:47] waitimdesyncd: bit*
[5:49:17] avenueone: toxic mes
[5:49:22] Antiquasar: Can you get dejacharacter addon @notmes so we can see the Gcd difference
[5:49:26] callmekill91: war just has MS and is physical into dk
[5:49:36] xseba02: is harder now to increase rank?
[5:49:46] xseba02: i mean people used to be at 3k
[5:49:52] Antiquasar: then can see how many gcds you lose but the %mastery verse gain
[5:49:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: That spin2win is ornery
[5:50:33] waitimdesyncd: @xseba02  we have people "just" under 3k in 3s EU right now at week 9
[5:52:12] callmekill91: trill and Sam ended the night at 2919 on NA tonight
[5:52:33] waitimdesyncd: Yeah so it doesnt look  like 3k is more than a week away
[5:52:55] shugguls: i remember in SL s4 there where ppl with glad mount day 1
[5:54:36] avenueone: mes didnt get glad sl s4
[5:54:36] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:54:42] avenueone: i think its his only 1 he missed
[5:54:50] waitimdesyncd: @shugguls  shadowlands have way more pvp activity and way way more rating being funneled to the glads
[5:55:28] shugguls: @waitimdesyncd that wasnt it, there was a trinket that scaled with rogue and they just 1 shot to 2400
[5:55:41] shugguls: took 2 weeks to nurf
[5:56:21] avenueone: Eternal Gladiator's Soul Eater
[5:56:50] Drminduskaftw: Lul
[5:56:53] avenueone: LUL
[5:57:03] Drminduskaftw: U funny
[5:57:06] waitimdesyncd: @shugguls  yeah I remember the pika video, but what im saying is still true too, and counting the trinket isnt really fair imo
[5:57:10] Drminduskaftw: 😭
[5:58:49] shugguls: @waitimdesyncd but then you would need to take in inflation in s1 DF there was non for 2s and 3s but all in solo, where this session there is non added to solo but its addd to 2s and 3s
[5:59:28] waitimdesyncd: @shugguls  Season 1 of DF is an outlier also because it was the first season with solo shuffle so everyone and their mom was queueing it before they got tired of the queue time
[5:59:30] happyheals: if they inflate my Druid, I have 4 more ready to gear
[6:00:14] shugguls: @waitimdesyncd so what sessons are you comparing?
[6:00:43] happyheals: great work
[6:00:57] waitimdesyncd: @shugguls  Im not really comparing anything, im just saying that Shadowlands had a lot of activity compared to shadowlands, and DFS1 had more activity than the later seasons of DF
[6:00:57] sillysheepweepandsleep: when is awc
[6:01:11] waitimdesyncd: as a reponse to you saying Shadowlands had glads day 1
[6:01:36] waitimdesyncd: compared to DF, pardon my poor communication skills LUL
[6:01:50] shugguls: @waitimdesyncd agree but there are diffrent factors involved so u carnt compare , SL had best pve gear in pvp, DF does not
[6:02:00] callmekill91: what about a crafted wep with vers mastery since it’ll be higher mastery than pvp wep
[6:02:09] shugguls: that drove ppl into pvp in SL
[6:02:12] waitimdesyncd: Yeah, agreed and that funneled even more rating to the top end players
[6:02:20] waitimdesyncd: yeah 1000%
[6:02:29] volyant: mes do you que solo que?
[6:03:55] avenueone: asmr: prohibitive asmrguy: prohobitive

[6:08:35] waitimdesyncd: sounds fine for us I think
[6:08:50] happyheals: Maybe turn down the output on your end

[6:11:45] DontDv8: gn mes and chat
[6:11:50] avenueone: it should if mes didnt disable it
[6:12:03] waitimdesyncd: @DontDv8  gn sleep tight
[6:12:09] callmekill91: ngl this build is much more damp but I think you’re way way tankier
[6:12:30] waitimdesyncd: we can always put (boom) (boom)  (boom) (boom) (boom) (boom) (boom) (boom) in /tts when mes is in a stressful clutch situation
[6:12:33] DontDv8: mesHeart2
[6:12:45] avenueone: mes is no fun
[6:12:52] callmekill91: does suck you just don’t have much kill pressure early as we used to be able to one shot in opener :(
[6:13:11] waitimdesyncd: or maybe some (gunshot) spam in tts when he is in 90% dam clenching his buttocks
[6:13:23] avenueone: i think ppl spammed Ugh minecraft noise
[6:13:26] avenueone: when mes turned it on
[6:13:32] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  are you guys running the execute with the high vers?
[6:13:54] callmekill91: not atm
[6:15:20] happyheals: Morgan: The things that come to those that wait may be the things left by those who got there first.

[6:15:43] waitimdesyncd: philosopher happie
[6:15:53] callmekill91: ya gimme a sec I’ll give it to ya
[6:16:12] waitimdesyncd: tysm much appreciated
[6:16:18] happyheals: I can philosiphise a thing or two if needed
[6:17:45] callmekill91: @waitimdesyncd BwPA/gf1fDREKLfAcG9Z2HkF/BAiEBSSLSkkkIRIikICAAAAAAAAAAJ5AJJSSKAAESJRSSCSA
[6:18:33] avenueone: Chewbacca: His weapon of choice is the Wookiee bowcaster (a crossbow-shaped directed-energy weapon). Chewbacca speaks only in his native language, Shyriiwook (which sounds like animal sound growls) he is able to understand Galactic Basic, but is physically unable to speak it.
[6:19:11] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  tysm! I really wanna test with harbinger and reaping
[6:19:31] happyheals: you can vote for the streamer awards
[6:19:41] waitimdesyncd: @avenueone bruuh i cant stop laughing at that listening to it then tab back  to twitch and reading what the text said
[6:19:44] happyheals: I randomly saw it
[6:20:42] happyheals: Oh that was here? I thought that noise was deep in my mind
[6:21:08] waitimdesyncd: @happyheals  it did sound scarily similar to my inner monologue too
[6:21:19] avenueone: thats a scary inner voice
[6:21:34] callmekill91: i do think tho with this, apoc feels like it does way more. I wish we would’ve tried this pre wound nerf. no troll.
[6:21:47] happyheals: nice
[6:22:03] Vademiica: can be tankier with battlemaster no + strenght stats?
[6:22:06] xiliketurtlex: whats your stats in arena
[6:22:07] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  how does it feel with clawing
[6:22:09] callmekill91: could’ve hit 300k apocalypse’s lol
[6:22:43] Mozaiczny: How u feel about ret right now?
[6:23:00] callmekill91: I tried it in bgs. mostly feels the same even with high verse. and with the build I linked. I’ve hit my highest death coil of the night at 183k
[6:23:13] happyheals: a 5 comboi rip for my resto druid is over 300k
[6:23:26] happyheals: fun
[6:23:35] callmekill91: but reaping consistently hits over 100k if they’re below 35% even without doomburst buff
[6:23:43] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  shiii, wouldnt harbinger of doom be insane then, if you get 2x doomburst procs on a target with 4 wounds?
[6:24:38] callmekill91: ya but the RNG there is kinda unreliable. with clawing its better to have 3 wounds, spend your death coil proc, and clawing. shit DUMPS damage

[6:26:06] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  I just love rotten touch harbinger reaping with clawing so so so much
[6:26:31] sunileif: @kklinker Saususge
[6:26:37] waitimdesyncd: but im not a good player in the grand perspective so I dont play against well optimized teams
[6:26:51] callmekill91: ngl I’ve never been a fan. don’t get me wrong, hitting 200K+ death coils is satisfying but I much prefer the plague bringer defile build. feels more original
[6:26:58] avenueone: ascend: i'm just empowering them.. doesn't feel like i can keep chasing the healer.. he lost his pet.. im a bm hunter without a pet doesn't do much.. can't stop this one.. hunters still half..
[6:27:38] wyldeshock: well lung collapsed again so having surgery at 2 today
[6:27:42] callmekill91: just wish soul reaper wasn’t absolute dog water
[6:27:45] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  Yeah if you dont play that then every team will flame you for not doing plaguebringer type omega dam. But I like playing from range so I can be closer to enemy healer to kick him while I doom burst the kill target in asphyx
[6:28:12] happyheals: dog water is important too. Dogs have to drink
[6:28:21] dadfreddie: that build is defensive, good for solo, should go way more aggressive in 2s
[6:28:25] callmekill91: true happy true
[6:28:33] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  yeah soul reaper is sadge... I do love defile tho
[6:28:37] pignofly: sorry mes was me on hunter xD
[6:29:15] callmekill91: defile is sick cause of mastery buff on top of this full mastery stack build. with grip of the dead. shit just gets ripped in half and can’t move
[6:29:22] happyheals: like people copying my priest build for raiding in Classic when I was running smite/holy Nova build
[6:29:43] waitimdesyncd: YUP! and it gives haste for you AND your pet to stack more festering wounds + it is bigger area of effect giving wounds to more targets
[6:30:19] callmekill91: leave it to lord Mes to carry us across the sea of nerfs
[6:31:17] waitimdesyncd: @callmekill91  as always inded lord mesington
[6:32:10] zuggthugg: dh is a bit busted
[6:32:13] waitimdesyncd: seems ur healer need to optimize some stuff, and some cooldown trading
[6:33:10] Deaddoomx: no blame for your healer but feels like you always half hp
[6:33:18] thunderstud25: hellooo
[6:33:21] Tenzoftw: HI, bro, dot build is better than clawing build rn ?
[6:33:44] callmekill91: healer is learning boys and trying :) we all start somewhere
[6:33:46] Roseqt: when i see spec options in retail .. the words : cluster f ... come to mind : )
[6:33:46] thunderstud25: good morning everyone
[6:34:34] Deaddoomx: @callmekill91 it’s not like he playing bad, just don’t heal to full hp for some reason
[6:34:43] waitimdesyncd: @Roseqt  wait til you see vanilla talents then. Only redeeming factor about vanilla talents is that only 1 cookie cutter build is "viable" for most
[6:35:23] Roseqt: @waitimdesyncd true @waitimdesyncd
[6:35:23] Vademiica: part of learning is adapting and taking advice, I see no flaming in here just people chipping in
[6:35:24] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[6:35:44] avenueone: shadowlands talents were the most complex
[6:35:59] waitimdesyncd: @Roseqt  but once you get some mastery over your retail class the talents become very manageable to proces
[6:36:12] waitimdesyncd: @avenueone  shadowlands and bfa talents were overly complicated Kappa
[6:36:43] bwfp: fucking hate atoning Sadge  I just heal on my priest most of the time lol
[6:36:50] Teatti: i think theres too much smite spam when ur both under 50%
[6:37:05] Vademiica: Could it be trying to do too much in stead of just topping you as well? common mistake
[6:37:06] Deaddoomx: kinda yes
[6:37:50] waitimdesyncd: DK has higher hp also, making it harder for him to top you
[6:38:09] Roseqt: @waitimdesyncd I returned to playing retail. hadn't played it in a year. trying to learn a new game : )
[6:38:38] waitimdesyncd: @Roseqt  It is very rewarding once you get  a hang of it mate, I really hope you enjoy your time
[6:39:08] Roseqt: @waitimdesyncd likewise
[6:41:48] waitimdesyncd: sexy md
[6:42:03] callmekill91: maybe pet buff gets dropped for rotten touch to give more kill pressure with death coil after procs. @notmes just theory crafting since 5% doesn’t seem to help early kill pressure. maybe im trolling and early kills are pipe dreams now.

[6:51:21] gremell: i agree

[6:51:56] wardelswijk: have u tried frost yet with 4 set buffs?

[6:56:14] Pa1ach7: What do you think guys about current state of DK? I felt like a papre before nerfs and i did not play it because no time. I am still learning and what do you think about builds? I am maxing mastery with little more haste and playing claving shadows but it looks that DOT build is sometimes better. Should i change stats for dots and claving or it doesnt matter?
[6:56:37] Mythh_93: Mes is playing vers build atm
[6:56:55] callmekill91: mastery verse*
[6:57:54] Mythh_93: Yeah that one SeemsGood
[6:58:18] Mythh_93: I'll stick to my healer knowledge lol
[6:58:25] Pa1ach7: Thanks a lot :) and is it possible to deal with warrs atm? i am feeling that it does not matter what i do but i lost 99% of games against warr :D
[6:59:00] callmekill91: tbh if you’re talking about 2s. the war has to throw to lose to you unless you kill his healer.
[6:59:16] callmekill91: if solo shuffle. chains of ice and kiting is your only hope.
[6:59:18] waitimdesyncd: @Pa1ach7  idk sometimes you need to chains of ice spam the war and kite around pillar so he cant charge you, if you have sharpen on you
[6:59:31] waitimdesyncd: ye
[7:00:07] waitimdesyncd: its wild how long you surrive sub 300k hp because of the vers
[7:00:21] hungarianbjorn: What is the addon that shows the big castbar in the middle?
[7:00:23] waitimdesyncd: and the dam reduc talent at low hp
[7:00:54] callmekill91: yaaaa dks become mad tanky with this verse level and will
[7:01:13] callmekill91: if you throw lich up you’re legit at 50% reduction while lich is up
[7:01:23] nikthevoker: +
[7:01:29] waitimdesyncd: I sadly dont have the conq to test vers build, and EU LFG is not popping at this time
[7:01:31] callmekill91: oh nvm he isn’t playing lich reduction
[7:01:56] brazkat: how much vers do you got mes
[7:02:21] Pa1ach7: @waitimdesyncd i see :) thanks for all advices and i hope that it will help me but of course there is also skill gap for me sometimes and i have a lot to learn in PvP
[7:02:33] waitimdesyncd: @brazkat  he is at like 37-38% rn iirc
[7:03:13] waitimdesyncd: @Pa1ach7  No one stops learning in wow PVP, so never get demotivated, remember to have fun, test stuff and dont mind your CR, play and enjoy the game, that is the best way to learn :D
[7:04:13] Mythh_93: Willingness to learn and take feedback is a great start. I've even dealt with some really strong worded feedback from rank 1s but the exp you gain from it all is worth a lot
[7:04:25] bestdkig: Brayden is gay
[7:04:39] Mythh_93: Also Brayden is gay I hear
[7:04:46] Zoortha: maybe check on murlok io ?
[7:05:04] thunderstud25: is their build leaning a lot into atonement as opposed to just a big shield + penance
[7:05:07] Pa1ach7: Thanks a lot for all advices :)
[7:05:32] thunderstud25: I feel like most discs I go up against don’t rely on atonement nearly as much these days
[7:05:36] Pa1ach7: @hungarianbjorn focus target castbar made bigger in customization or idk :D
[7:05:44] brazkat: my ret feels super squishy since patch
[7:06:00] Teatti: what about radiance?
[7:06:27] gremell: the goat
[7:06:32] gremell: watching the goat rn
[7:06:34] thunderstud25: radiance, shields and penance usually do a bulk of the healing from what I remember seeing
[7:06:45] Teatti: ye idd
[7:06:54] Yoskexz: what do u think of this, wrist vers emb + chest vers emb
[7:07:00] Teatti: radiance > big penance > big shield
[7:07:41] waitimdesyncd: disc + dk doesnt feel good imo, we already have loads of walls, but DK need BIIG healing output like 800k regrowths imo
[7:09:29] petkicklol: disc dk is awful ya
[7:09:57] Yoskexz: bro look at his pet name lmfao
[7:10:06] Mythh_93: It's a momentum healer need to use cds high hp to keep you topped rather than trying to catch up which feels stress
[7:10:24] crawnpocktail: disc just does no healing unless you go gimpy ass 3s build
[7:10:25] Pa1ach7: i am playing with Sham and it feels better than with priest
[7:10:53] ultiexilate: you playing bursting sores with dot build?
[7:10:57] ultiexilate: better than ebon?
[7:11:28] rikolte: What is the name of Weak Aura that writes everything on the screen?

[7:13:39] crawnpocktail: @rikolte if its the one showing your cooldowns ending its probably that
[7:13:44] nargonisttv: Rshaman in the house
[7:16:05] crawnpocktail: @KKPkMn also its an addon not a WA ^^

[7:18:21] gremell: half the 2s population is dh i promise you all my broken keyboards i went through can attest to this
[7:20:31] Aazua: What's the rational behind playing disease build rather than clawing in 2s?
[7:20:42] rikolte: @KKPkMn I'm pretty sure it's WA. It's the one that writes everything on the screen for you. For example: Anti Zone is ending in 10sec , Phase shift 5sec, Someone used trinket, stand still in a spell, et cetera

[7:22:18] crawnpocktail: which he does have too
[7:22:54] rikolte: I think I tried it and it's not working for some reason, or just partially.
[7:23:17] waitimdesyncd: the icons at top is just omnibar, no?
[7:23:25] waitimdesyncd: shows cd on enemy abilities so he knows what to expect
[7:23:31] nargonisttv: Anyone here around 2k wanna que with Rshaman?
[7:25:00] waitimdesyncd: I imagine if you played with a rdru rn youd be immortal in 2s
[7:26:11] waitimdesyncd: we need a runic power redeem: "clawing woulda killed there" LUL Kappa
[7:27:13] gremell: is it me or is rdru more overtuned than anything rn
[7:28:39] ultiexilate: could i peep talents pls?

[9:41:35] Talason: microsoft not just blizz
[9:42:01] GeniusPanda: rayycDab
[9:42:27] aedd__: Means they were bleeding money through excess labour.
[9:42:33] thunderstud25: well what happens is that a lot of companies bloated their organizational chart in order to try to capture growth
[9:42:49] thunderstud25: but that resulted in role redundancy and inefficiencies
[9:42:54] thunderstud25: its not exclusively a cost play
[9:42:58] waitimdesyncd: It will also look better with the war within preorders coming in, that they have lower costs and high pre-order/return at the same time
[9:43:01] artsskeit: maybe they were poached by amazon to finally fix new world

[9:43:36] Magiskamor: how do u kill through tranquillity?
[9:43:54] thunderstud25: so a lot of companies are leaning up in order to be more efficient and reduce organizational bloat
[9:44:08] Mythh_93: @nargonisttv super jealous of the exp you're getting right now haha nearly 2.1k let's gooo
[9:44:22] ZealotryTV: i mean most companies in general are extremely bloated
[9:45:13] nargonisttv: @Mythh_93 thanks, it's a interesting bit of information coming really quick
[9:45:25] Stenzycabenzy: quick google search 1900 layoffs from Activision Blizzard?!

[9:47:15] heresjohnnny: layoffs all across tech. this is a tough january. pour one out for em
[9:48:09] Stenzycabenzy: Palworld was released and they all threw there hands up in there.
[9:48:31] thunderstud25: i wouldn't be surprised if these cuts are largely targeted around performance and organizational bloat while simultaneously creating more horizontal/growth opportunities for existing microsoft employees that they wantt to continue to invest in
[9:48:36] thunderstud25: and not cost based
[9:48:47] aedd__: @ZealotryTV Forgot about the "King" part.
