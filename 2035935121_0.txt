[3:19:35] al_capow: yeah take a look at mine for how you can do it
[3:19:45] Cuhrismuh: That would be amazing I run a lot of no voice
[3:20:00] Teeball: and it gives you like a minimap of the rbg itself
[3:20:01] al_capow: basically what I do is I make a frame, like an icon aura and make it empty, then I use the lua CreateFrame api and mask it on top with the button template
[3:20:02] GamerKrown: What build are you running for phdk mainly. Clawing/bursting or scourge variety builds?

[3:22:08] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:27:27] al_capow: the only slight bummer about WA is it's like, 10% harder to make an "addon" inside of it because you need to sneak around the WA framework a little bit

[5:11:47] zetro2525: cut
[5:11:51] Machina89: how much did your leech do last game?
[5:11:51] bump1: hunters suck, and every comp with them will always suck
[5:13:10] bump1: so you play dot build into every comp besides vs double caster?
[5:13:13] bump1: then its claw?
[5:13:45] BruceleeDK: dot build has been feeling pretty good i played it all night tonight
[5:14:00] bump1: get out of here Bruce
[5:14:06] BruceleeDK: outside of the obvious clawing scenarios
[5:14:09] Vaale17: Can you pls Show your DMG Break down?

[5:15:20] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:15:27] bump1: also in 2s, always dot?
[5:16:35] BruceleeDK: like frost dk dev would be clawing
[5:16:36] Pwnyo808: I wouldnâ€™t say hunter is BAD, itâ€™s just not completely busted.  Itâ€™s good tho
[5:16:55] Demonicsoul4: hey can you show talents? the "dot" spec
[5:20:55] Pwnyo808: Holy damage
[5:23:11] amnetv: which build do you like more ?
[5:24:03] bump1: thats the wrong one lol, thats from the previous game
[5:24:07] bump1: the fuck
[5:24:14] bump1: 10.2.5 is breaking the game
[5:24:18] BruceleeDK: super weird cdew stream might have it
[5:24:29] amnetv: if you have Reflex addon you can check
[5:25:36] Pwnyo808: 23 is still wild
[5:27:18] Pwnyo808: Do you think there are any outliers for performance when it comes to classes?

[5:28:44] amnetv: mes, how`s our necro wounds healing reduction calculated when paired with another MS ?
[5:31:37] amnetv: was wondering because it feels a bit off when I check the details healing absorb
[5:33:02] BruceleeDK: so many games it feels like theyre going me, I was seeing pretty low uptime too
[5:33:22] BruceleeDK: maybe it's still worth with opener's and go's
[5:33:35] BruceleeDK: the versa ones yea
[5:35:07] BruceleeDK: if wounds proc that would be big
[5:35:36] BruceleeDK: the wrists is whats used in pve
[5:35:36] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:36:11] BruceleeDK: yea i think 305 or so
[5:36:14] avenueone: still not full pve value
[5:37:01] avenueone: its just garbo
[5:37:20] avenueone: ya even in pve rets just go x2 shadowflame
[5:37:26] Cchewwy: wassup mes
[5:38:04] Cchewwy: solos ?
[5:38:07] avenueone: if shadowflame patch nerfed in pvp deffo not worth
[5:38:20] avenueone: sometimes that belt can beat 1 shadowflame patch
[5:38:22] avenueone: w rng
[5:39:38] goatedsp: is there a way to copy your edit mode ui like a link

[5:41:23] goatedsp: I have gold on tich, trade me
[5:41:34] al_capow: mes what was the WA chuck wanted?
[5:42:25] al_capow: change icon on debuff hmm
[5:43:09] al_capow: like always? maybe just rename the icon file in assets to the name of debuff lol
[5:43:53] dankNstein_: if its a wa icon
[5:43:56] al_capow: I assume so, in WA there's a path to the texture for the icon, so I'd guess if you copy+paste the icon you want to the same path it'd work
[5:45:19] al_capow: otherwise I guess you'd have to make a TSU aura and check if it's the right debuff and swap the icon texture path when you create the clone for it
[5:46:05] al_capow: side note though, fully obsessed with this rune WA
[5:46:13] al_capow: I tried it in raid for a gdkp and the QoL was so nice
[5:46:33] avenueone: mes still has a warrior he hasnt levelled
[5:46:39] avenueone: even tho i sent him 20g worth of mats
[5:48:21] avenueone: look?
[5:48:37] avenueone: no the warbringer rune mats i gave u lol
[5:49:15] dadsmoocher: Can I have 20 bucks
[5:50:22] dawsonator171: are we still not legendary?
[5:51:27] dawsonator171: depends on what the ppm is tbh.
[5:51:59] skidetko: Do you think dot build is the move cause I feel like it's paddy also my comp doens't have a mortal strike I tend to close games alot better with clawing build
[5:52:13] RocaRay: Oh wow I just did your recrafts
[5:52:15] RocaRay: It's an honor!
[5:52:22] RocaRay: would've done it for free
[5:52:29] avenueone: mes was complaining about prices
[5:52:40] dawsonator171: what kind of streamer doesn't reap the bennies?
[5:52:44] boltozor: LUL
[5:52:46] RocaRay: He's a generous tipper, I didn't even specify a price
[5:53:38] dawsonator171: mes is world renowned for his tip.
[5:54:02] RocaRay: It was quite large
[5:54:06] TiltTeamGG: 2020Snacking
[5:54:08] al_capow: I just realized, for chucks WA isn't it similar to his "anotha one" WA from wrath? he added a new asset to game file for that one too
[5:54:13] avenueone: he was complaining about 10k
[5:54:17] avenueone: so cant have been that large
[5:54:26] BruceleeDK: I have verdant on my lock, in a 5min30sec game it had 51% uptime
[5:54:46] BruceleeDK: another 5min40sec game 40% uptime
[5:55:11] boltozor: how good is being able to dragon ride in the old world, right? loving it
[5:55:21] RocaRay: Mes I can do any other recrafts for free, in an M+ rn though
[5:55:24] BruceleeDK: low end seems to be 35-40% uptime
[5:55:54] avenueone: id charge double to a streamer
[5:55:54] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:56:20] dawsonator171: I charge streamers triple. they are just in streaming for money anyways. Ask Chuck.
[5:56:42] boltozor: you can absolutely recraft rings
[5:56:45] amnetv: why didnt you went down on ERW route? isn`t the Icy Talons att speed worth for more Doomburst procs?
[5:56:45] RocaRay: I can only do blacksmithing and the cloak
[5:57:31] avenueone: what about toying with lariat mes?
[5:58:45] amnetv: wait you`re not playing doomburst at all now ?
[5:59:19] avenueone: they mighta changed it? they did rework it after s1
[5:59:38] Xcyyted: would u play without doomburst in shuffle too? or just due to the DH combo leaving it out?
[6:00:40] dawsonator171: if you wanted to do 2s i can log rdruid.
[6:00:44] amnetv: would you take necro bargain in stead of doomburst if with lets say ww or other class ?
[6:01:36] amnetv: no defile and going pet route ?
[6:03:37] waffleberryx: oh no im getting flashbacks of getting sepsis oneshot in slands from the mespera
[6:04:03] subarUWUw: PogChamp

[6:30:07] afriKENx: when are we qing assa destro mes
[6:30:10] afriKENx: i need a rogue in my life
[6:30:34] afriKENx: idk i only see sub rogues but
[6:30:37] afriKENx: rogues a rogue
[6:31:01] afriKENx: bro i spent like 4 hours qing double demo rdruid today lol
[6:31:20] afriKENx: i had so much fun making everyone miserable
[6:31:22] happyheals: yesterday my power went out right after I asked about rbgs. Did y'all end up kicking some butt in some?
[6:31:24] Ponycopter: how much haste as UH DK?
[6:32:51] happyheals: Mesx is number 6 overall on the PVP leaderboard
[6:33:44] happyheals: that is awesome, Trill at number 1
[6:33:55] happyheals: you guys are gonna do big things this season
[6:34:01] dawsonator171: you're number 1 in our hearts happy.
[6:34:24] happyheals: I get limited time to play, last seasonm I played 2 weekends
[6:35:22] happyheals: but went to 14 different countries and slept like 3-4 hours a day
[6:35:27] happyheals: so that was fun
[6:35:47] technick28: world of waiting "WoW"
[6:36:14] ooomeee: OMEGALUL
[6:36:35] happyheals: lol just saw Trill is also 27th
[6:36:47] dawsonator171: nah. my little guy is not having it tonight.
[6:36:49] al_capow: my team got reorged today, one day you wake up and suddenly have a new manager lol
[6:37:37] happyheals: At least you still have work. Be blessed
[6:37:51] rautaxd: Did he update his unit frames already?
[6:38:50] happyheals: I dunno, I have spent more time fixing my ui than playing since I got home
[6:38:51] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[6:39:54] rautaxd: Yeah, I used a script of his awhile back to move unitframes and runes, love the look but its broken now.
[6:41:28] al_capow: did they change it again?
[6:42:11] happyheals: caused a lot of errors that made abilities not work properly
[6:42:27] al_capow: oh interesting, stealth update
[6:42:50] happyheals: was healing Mes and a macro started only targeting me
[6:43:07] happyheals: had one that made me reload ui mid pull in m+
[6:43:17] afriKENx: i like how they broke retail ui by adding it and then broke wrath ui adding it
[6:43:36] al_capow: my favorite ui was GW1 in 2004 where they already let you customize everything lol
[6:45:01] happyheals: I think I saw they added something to change the character bar and target bar. Haven't looked at it
[6:45:22] al_capow: I learned today you can press alt to cycle through fsobj and print the table id if you need it to compare the pointer
[6:45:24] al_capow: so nice
[6:45:46] happyheals: cool how you can make it bigger but not smaller
[6:45:49] Solushun: Melee/Destro feels rough :(
[6:45:54] happyheals: kind of a slap in the face
[6:46:00] Solushun: do you usally go warlock if its melee/lock?
[6:46:20] Solushun: with the bolts stuff randomly exploding
[6:46:35] rizdane: wanna play some 2s?
[6:50:38] happyheals: For the first time ever I see they added a motion sickness function to a game
[6:50:51] happyheals: I used to get sick playing spyro the dragon as a kid
[6:52:38] happyheals: so weird that you can jump out of planes and do crazy stuff but watching a dragon move in a game makes you sick
[6:52:47] happyheals: moves*
[6:56:03] TheInfamous_One: how rude
[6:56:12] TheInfamous_One: you didnt wave back
[6:56:39] happyheals: I was wondering if you are a melee team vs a lock team, would it be a strat to go healer if they are trying to run around a pillar?
[6:56:58] happyheals: that way you are losing lock at least partially?>
[6:58:19] Solushun: i got fukin farmed man like 1-5 vs locks
[6:58:26] Solushun: was lock ww lock warrior
[6:58:27] happyheals: yeah lock can get around. I mean target the healer so lock has to run around to get los
[6:58:51] happyheals: I am just thinking about that stuffbefore I gear up my warrior
[6:58:51] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[6:58:57] Solushun: one game was 8:20 they were attacking lock all game couldnt die
[6:59:13] Solushun: then i get stormbolt behind pillar gated too dead lol
[6:59:58] happyheals: that was why I was wondering if it might be beneficial for double melee to stay on healer in those fights
[7:02:38] happyheals: for some reason I remember aff lock warr being good in the past. Maybe BFA?
[7:05:01] happyheals: oh yeah that was with that soul swap damage
[7:05:10] happyheals: I was trying to remember
[7:05:55] atoker: there was only 1 group in lfg for rbgs when I checked at 3am CST
[7:07:35] atoker: they're only really enjoyable with you or supatease and bajheera ... discord groups have people getting upset all the time
[7:08:54] happyheals: I did the discord stuff in Shadowlands and got pretty high, and even in some of the chiller groups it could get toxic fast
[7:09:38] atoker: it's night and day with mes' groups
[7:09:58] happyheals: Mes' groups made me happy, I didn't care if a toon lost mmr or not, because people genuinely had fun
[7:10:15] happyheals: s toon being mine*
[7:10:20] happyheals: a
[7:10:22] atoker: with mes = super fun, discord groups = not so fun
[7:11:17] happyheals: I played with some chill groups up to like 2200 in season 1 shadowlands but eventually some toxicity would creep in lol
[7:11:55] atoker: I do enjoy blitz most of the time though, it's much better than yolo rbgs ... most of the games are close, and I finish with top kills a lot of times
[7:12:20] afriKENx: we love muffinrat
[7:12:44] happyheals: did anyone else's mouse cursor get smaller after reset?
[7:13:02] happyheals: it might have been me with the monitor swap
[7:13:21] atoker: ....and if people give up in blitz I just queue for a shuffle on my 2nd account as a healer so there's no real downside anymore
[7:13:36] happyheals: It got really small and I thought I was going crazy or maybe blind
[7:14:13] atoker: I lose track of my cursor sometimes... in wow I use cursor trail it helps

[7:47:57] armin_ed: Interesting
[7:48:16] deadlycalm: It's just awesome on dk don't know why ðŸ˜ƒ
[7:48:20] shugguls: i got 1 more warrior to try on heroic, so far lucked out on 2 warriors and a dk, every week farming HC
[7:48:54] derangedhippo: The hate for unholy is real atm sadly.
[7:48:54] shugguls: high , when rogues are top tier they nurf dks
[7:51:54] jojje101: o/
[7:53:06] jojje101: hey! super intrested in hearing your toughts about the legendary axe in pvp. is it good? do you loose out on alot not getting it?
[7:55:24] jojje101: fits warriors abit more i guess
[7:55:31] jojje101: the crit part
[7:55:38] shugguls: yer war i think is more
[7:56:06] waitimdesyncd: might be more on the team having it lowering the uptime too
[7:56:13] jojje101: just got it and the dot is shit and the on use is even worse. so it feels like its only for the ilvl

[7:59:50] tinydman: Coming back and start gearing in 2s this weekend
[7:59:50] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[8:00:00] atoker: I got completely annihilated by their rogue like 4 times
[8:00:28] tinydman: How many pve items can you craft now ?
[8:00:30] avenueone: what do u consider weak specs mes
[8:01:06] waitimdesyncd: Did you get around to testing 45 sec goes without sudden doom etc?  I feel like there are 3-4 builds on DK that I really like but it clouds my ability to settle on one
[8:03:47] indithedog: feral
[8:04:04] avenueone: fyrakk is a very heavy pad fight in p2
[8:04:28] happyheals: there wasn't an arms warr yet a few days ago
[8:04:32] indithedog: oh i meant feral feels weak in pvp
[8:04:43] armin_ed: Really?
[8:04:49] armin_ed: That seems weird
[8:05:20] happyheals: missing someone
[8:05:26] indithedog: do all kills get logged
[8:05:45] armin_ed: Unless showing the top people only?
[8:15:03] goonbear96: r u clawing shadows or dot build in rbgs
[8:23:15] stockbridge10: gl

[8:28:19] indithedog: u got fans
[8:28:59] waitimdesyncd: Cant be famous in rbgs
[8:30:19] wowsuomi: Nasdaq about to set a new ath'
[8:30:20] waitimdesyncd: can you critique this build when you have time? The plaguebringer, superstrain choices are buggling my mind
[8:30:21] waitimdesyncd: https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/death-knight/unholy/DAPUVUUBSFVEQREJKEBQNVUhAVAmUFRSkFBA
[8:30:35] indithedog: ill pocket u on priest Kappa
[8:31:53] wowsuomi: Nvda setting new ath's everyday this week
[8:32:14] ultiexilate: @notmes what do you play instead of empower rune weapon?
[8:32:18] ultiexilate: can u show talents pls
[8:32:33] ultiexilate: would you play in arena too?
[8:32:41] waitimdesyncd: @ultiexilate  He has like 6 alternatives to empower
[8:32:52] waitimdesyncd: Mes has been creative in the right tree
[8:32:59] ultiexilate: agree, as the talents on the way to empower as kinda trash - so you play more defensive talents instead, I assume
[8:32:59] waitimdesyncd: left*
[8:33:20] ultiexilate: like lich dmg reduct, gloom ward etc
[8:33:34] waitimdesyncd: lower kick cd can also be good to save dam and save cc on the team
[8:33:35] indithedog: is mw best healer in rbgs
[8:35:35] waitimdesyncd: There are quite a few "45s go" builds. Either with clawing, and with and without bursting sores, unholy pact etc
[8:36:25] ultiexilate: ive been using clawing single target build every game
[8:36:38] ultiexilate: wondering if its bad to never go dot build/scourge strike/ebon fever etc
[8:37:05] ultiexilate: im playing wwdk so i prefer single target dmg in goes rather than pad dmg
[8:37:22] Burkolo_: Hey mes, can I get some help on how to set up minion namplates this smaller, and totems with their icons on top
[8:43:03] ultiexilate: could you give your thoughts on talents when u have a mo!
[8:47:00] ultiexilate: thanks! does dropping the auto attack talents on the way to empower significantly impact doomburst procs?
[8:47:00] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[8:47:18] reedthesham: Good morning mes and chat:)
[8:47:59] ultiexilate: ty, so helpful
[8:49:07] ultiexilate: last Q, would you tend to play defile over single morbidity, even against e.g double caster?
[8:51:34] Disparage: otto had to go ggs
[8:52:27] ultiexilate: interesting. I have always been running long-grip range as wwdk, but perhaps it's time to try slow
[8:54:11] devascienos: yeah just changing charaters
[8:54:22] waitimdesyncd: i got that tilt in me, second time this month im down 200 rating for no reason D:
[8:54:29] happyheals: I'm starting my warrior too, so when he is up I can play him
[8:55:34] Ziamonlock: hey man, want a lock or ret? Im in que on lock atm
[8:55:44] TheInfamous_One: @notmes need a rogue <3?
[8:55:51] Ziamonlock: ye
[8:56:34] waitimdesyncd: Sadge
[8:58:10] happyheals: in shadowlands the raiders would farm and hit like 2.5k then not play the rest of the season
[8:58:22] happyheals: to get some pieces maxed out
[8:58:24] EndlessPillows: What is a change you would like to see to PvP that helps make it more accessible to new/inexperienced players that doesn't cause this top end issue you're describing?
[8:58:29] yourKnightmaare: I lowkey miss the old gearing up system. where you had to reach a certain rating to upgrade gear
[8:58:39] beepboopx9: @happyheals they only went to 2.1
[8:59:00] happyheals: Oh, I don't know why I thought 2.5
[8:59:04] happyheals: makes more sense
[8:59:32] beepboopx9: almost impossible to get glad that early
[9:00:26] happyheals: I just remember late season looking and seeing most of the higher rated people hadn't played in a while
[9:00:37] ultiexilate: what is name of gem giving primary stat and mastery pls
[9:00:42] beepboopx9: the only fix that wont break blizzard is to fix how glad or rating is inflating
[9:00:44] armin_ed: the fotm meta is also insane
[9:01:01] Qtpiextclolz: what do you think about a rating decay?
[9:01:06] Siccarius101: i don't mind the gearing and leveling portion but the shuffle stuff is annoying its a mmo not a single player game
[9:01:11] beepboopx9: go back to rating requirment from glad?
[9:01:28] happyheals: it isn't on ah, it is crafted from the place behind ah
[9:01:49] EndlessPillows: Do you think there is ever a world where there is some sort of skill ranking system that actually takes the player account as a whole?
[9:01:59] happyheals: Illimited diamond
[9:02:16] Applezbtw: i remember having 4 or 5 lobbies in a row with tripple ret pally one day  LUL .
[9:02:22] EndlessPillows: Great point on the ForM lobby setup, that's actually huge
[9:02:25] rythemix: is there a reason why they do that? wtf
[9:02:35] happyheals: we need rated comp stomp
[9:02:38] beepboopx9: @EndlessPillows they sorta did that with rank 1 already
[9:03:06] EndlessPillows: I might be moving to the WoW team pretty soon, so I'm trying to pick your brain here a bit if you don't mind
[9:03:42] Burkolo_: what if they add pve revards at certain arena ratings
[9:03:48] happyheals: just don't ask him to do math
[9:03:51] waitimdesyncd: Imma say my peace, I know im meant to go 2-4 sometimes, but ANYONE can fumble and throw without using cds and die in the first 10 sec of the match, turning it into a 1-5 or 0-6
[9:03:51] EndlessPillows: I've always loved PvP and see it suffer from the problems you are describing, and none of my friends want to dive in to try it
[9:03:59] EndlessPillows: Would love to see more movement towards solving both issues
[9:06:16] EndlessPillows: I actually think PvP gear should be useful in PvE and vice versa. I think there is a version where players on both sides on the fence are happy. I preferred when the gear overlapped a bit like that in WotLK/Cata
[9:06:18] armin_ed: Yeah they need to bring vanilla core back to the game...
[9:06:24] EndlessPillows: exactly exactly
[9:06:29] happyheals: only thing that would help is moving people who reach a certain rating in solo shuffle to a separate champions q to allow less bloat
[9:07:09] EndlessPillows: This is super obvious if you play Classic right now
[9:07:09] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[9:07:16] EndlessPillows: It's the exact opposite of what you are describing
[9:07:39] waitimdesyncd: a biased unbiased opinion
[9:07:59] waitimdesyncd: Yeah
[9:08:04] EndlessPillows: I think it can be made to help build players like you up too. If we can make that cross-content play, that could create more content for your audience
[9:08:08] beepboopx9: big thing for that is the vault. i dont dont to be punished for pvping. or doing keys. i have a pvp only char and a key char. its super annoying to fill vaults on multiple chars  or be super behind
[9:08:11] EndlessPillows: As long as you're enjoying the journey
[9:08:27] indithedog: are u saying ur professionally against legendaries in the game
[9:08:35] EndlessPillows: Totally
[9:08:43] waitimdesyncd: I cant even test a build in solo shuff because I tank rating faster than I can get queues to gain my rating back. And 3s in EU at this time is VERY dead. No chance to finda good session
[9:08:49] Solushun: a lot of the fun early in the season is gettring my gear I wouldn't lilke templates
[9:09:00] Solushun: im scared about removing PvP vaults next xpac for world quests
[9:09:11] Solushun: might ruin the fun since wont pvp for vault sockets
[9:09:20] beepboopx9: yeah would be hard to translate wow to controller with out killing the difficulty of wow
[9:09:50] EndlessPillows: IIRC Cata had a ton of new PvPers, I might have misremembered though
[9:09:56] Applezbtw: he crushed me aswell LUL
[9:10:08] sunileif: why would they add controler options when microsoft is ditching xbox
[9:10:17] EndlessPillows: And then they find out PvP is actually dope
[9:10:43] despised1: cata was complex with all the buttons
[9:10:52] wowsuomi: Staff wielding mage
[9:11:11] beepboopx9: i mean to add to that. i started in TBC and got asked by a real life friend to arena and had a blast roasting people with pve geared lok
[9:11:32] EndlessPillows: Overused, IMO. Those isles are made every patch and become obsolete the next
[9:11:59] saiyan333: MoP Mage, Lock 2's was so fun
[9:12:19] Hippwn: MoP the class design just made it so fun to play your character
[9:12:28] armin_ed: MoP wpvp was popping too with that island
[9:12:29] wowsuomi: The only reason i ever went to the island was to kill that one boss every week
[9:12:30] sputterz: gameplay and balance
[9:12:45] EndlessPillows: 100% agree with that
[9:12:47] Hippwn: I think it is good now
[9:12:54] armin_ed: Disc priest class design is insane
[9:13:02] EndlessPillows: I spend more time thinking about talents then I ever have
[9:13:02] saiyan333: aside from a few outliers class design this xpac is really good
[9:13:34] Begasaur: its interesting to look back and realize mop was good, because during the time of it people said the complete opposite hence teh 5 million sub loss
[9:13:35] Gooseberries: They were on a roll with SP, but then the wrecked it
[9:13:38] JustTaki: ^.^
[9:13:46] Sphexator: I remember the little time in MoP demo locks with the tank glyph could one shot people lol
[9:13:58] wowsuomi: Microsoft making the game now
[9:14:01] HatedHero_Uttress: it only seems worse because people at low rank have BIS gear this expansion
[9:14:12] waitimdesyncd: broooooo balance issues? This is no where NEAR the ptsd from gpiespam and chaos bolt spam with haste corruptions in BFAS4
[9:14:25] waitimdesyncd: I still wake up drenched in sweat
[9:14:32] EndlessPillows: How do Augs do in shuffle?
[9:14:34] waitimdesyncd: thinking about lock/mage with haste corruptions
[9:14:37] melbu2423: G'morning mes and chat mesHeart2
[9:14:37] atoker: @EndlessPillows shuffle needs to be 1 round only, and we need  more than 1 end game tier set, so we can mix and match and experiment
[9:14:52] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/VvQNdB
[9:15:10] beepboopx9: @HatedHero_Uttress tried to gear my gruid a few weeks ago . ooof full greens and no teir was an adventure against full purp DHs
[9:16:21] wowsuomi: What is the new zone for?
[9:16:24] EndlessPillows: Does being rated against "only" your spec help mitigate that? Or does it actually make it worse
[9:16:36] jepsc: hey how are you mes? what addon do you use for the big name plates for team names as well as enemy
[9:16:47] sunileif: enh is like 4th raid dps
[9:17:23] yourKnightmaare: SL felt fotm af to me
[9:17:25] sunileif: that goes inline with their warband theme tho
[9:17:28] yourKnightmaare: season 1 convoke
[9:17:43] sunileif: they are shifting away from you got 1 character style
[9:17:43] Applezbtw: i liked when it took you an entire season to reroll fotm and by the time u geared it up and leveled it the season was over
[9:17:46] HatedHero_Uttress: @beepboopx9  you are late.
[9:18:07] sunileif: oomkins to oomkins
[9:18:12] beepboopx9: feels real bad
[9:18:28] sunileif: got wrecked by convoke -> make a druid
[9:18:28] yourKnightmaare: convoke made the game feel really bad
[9:18:33] melbu2423: remember corrupted gear  in bfa lol
[9:19:15] melbu2423: some corrupted gear was insane
[9:19:25] melbu2423: yeah
[9:19:38] reaperz14: Maxing out your corruption. Kept having to dodge things LOL
[9:19:43] HatedHero_Uttress: Classic season of corruption
[9:19:48] reaperz14: was a great time
[9:19:53] sunileif: dream empowered
[9:20:03] melbu2423: thats actually when i playwed BFA the most
[9:20:32] melbu2423: OP stuff is fun but not balanced like you said
[9:21:38] Siccarius101: gpys were op af in bfa lol .7sec fastest in the game
[9:22:08] ultiexilate: do you miss necrotic strike?
[9:22:31] sunileif: i believe in you team
[9:22:37] sunileif: even if mes dont
[9:22:41] sunileif: <,<
[9:23:27] melbu2423: isnt necrotic strike the one where it would take away the targets healing or something?
[9:24:18] melbu2423: i think its a gg
[9:26:53] melbu2423: ahhh
[9:28:06] TheInfamous_One: not to mention subs opener does 150k dps
[9:28:06] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[9:28:26] melbu2423: yeah you really do know when to use your stuff as a rogue
[9:28:33] melbu2423: do ned*

[9:28:47] kendorson: we arent in q
[9:28:49] kendorson: someone declined
[9:28:49] Siccarius101: idk seen an assa rogue hit a 6stack tank for a 1.75mil kingsbane lol
[9:29:26] melbu2423: he was talking about burst vs sustained damage
[9:29:30] melbu2423: im playing sub
[9:29:32] melbu2423: LUL
[9:29:52] wantedaus: Assa in RBG is mental
[9:30:06] ultiexilate: do you think precognition is good or bad for the game (I'm annoyed we can't pet root anymore)
[9:30:07] wantedaus: Massive damage
[9:30:11] Siccarius101: just saying love assa lol and hits hard af get mil+ on tanks all the time and prenerf 600ks in arena post like 300-400k
[9:31:19] happyheals: I would like it for healers only
[9:31:38] atoker: what about the caster trinket from SL?
[9:32:03] melbu2423: right
[9:32:49] happyheals: easy counter to that is everyone stop interrupting
[9:33:00] EndlessPillows: Fantastic points
[9:33:05] ultiexilate: it feels best to never press kick anymore
[9:33:06] ultiexilate: too risky
[9:33:07] devascienos: give like a main stat buff
[9:33:07] 1mmortalz95: hear me out... 2v2 double dps que only
[9:33:14] ultiexilate: e.g vs feral
[9:33:57] happyheals: it almost felt like it was introduced for convoke
[9:34:08] EndlessPillows: It's a negative sum interaction
[9:34:10] poasa21: agreed
[9:34:15] EndlessPillows: in terms of fun
[9:34:21] Bucco0: Hey Mes, how much haste% do you need for unholy dk in PVP ?
[9:35:32] EndlessPillows: Feedback from players at your level is crazy valuable, design ability or not
[9:35:37] poasa21: like a defensive spell reduction for juking
[9:35:49] EndlessPillows: And you're more articulate when it comes to game issues/vs symptoms than most pros I interact with FWIW
[9:35:53] happyheals: change it to an on use cd that makes you have the same buff on a long cd that lowers the cd when you successfully fake cast
[9:35:57] Qtpiextclolz: what would you do instead? i feel like any reward for juking would still lead to you being upset with a teammate
[9:35:59] Gooseberries: Increase kick cd and if they get juked it gets doubled
[9:36:06] devascienos: like even giving them aura and take the immune to cc out
[9:36:57] happyheals: if you successfully juke it ccs the enemy
[9:37:32] happyheals: or no, it silences them
[9:38:37] Burkolo_: reduce the cast time on next spell?
[9:39:29] Gooseberries: its real fun counterspelling into nether ward and getting precog for free
[9:40:37] Rustyz0r: As a caster playing in Australia with 200ms I like precog alot lol
[9:42:36] ultiexilate: there's a large element of luck to kicking as wel
[9:42:45] ultiexilate: not like juking a kick is a big skill move
[9:42:57] ultiexilate: it's all mind games though
[9:43:34] ultiexilate: yeah genuinely I am tempted to start playing dark sim as a pseudo-kick
[9:43:38] ultiexilate: so they are scared to finish cast
[9:44:39] ultiexilate: they would still stop the cast at least, even if you don't get the ability?
[9:44:49] wantedaus: could you darksim, on a precog to get the next spell?
[9:44:52] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!

[9:47:26] jfachal: is a plater profile ?

[9:48:36] rogerthatsir69: i see thanks
[9:48:41] ultiexilate: how to get artisan's mettle for recrafting
[9:48:43] ultiexilate: ?
[9:49:42] jfachal: how do you recraft it after taking out embellishment? you need one some in the server ?
[9:49:44] ultiexilate: great to chat, gtg! have a good stream
[9:51:46] vuldronx: No doomburst gaming?
[9:55:31] waitimdesyncd: yaay
[9:55:59] vuldronx: Yeah I like the no doomburst idea, gives more options for PvP talents if you really like strang
