[0:56:59] ashwing_: PVP LUL
[0:57:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Gotta test it all, thoroughly
[0:57:05] sh4d0wsky: @DallDK thats hard :)
[0:57:11] Alephmempe: @Sollice I use to watch Braindeadly a lot too.  I do not see him as much now as back then.
[0:57:12] strike879: yea i mean if its technicly dragonflight they delivered on the legal speach of dragonflight 2022
[0:57:13] gidgeet: No way it launches in November
[0:57:14] Sollice: I would kind of like to see DH talents now to see if I want to play DH in S4 a bit
[0:57:19] justagamingfiend: can't wait to see what specs and classes are broken AF at the start of the expansion
[0:57:33] doomester: @Towelliee id rather have a delayed launch than having a bugged launch
[0:57:50] Nazz_1138: Nazz1138 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! <3
[0:58:03] gritbarontv: well they will have to deal with the bug, or just wait
[0:58:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: deal with 4Head
[0:58:18] Zuhbuumafu: dev cycles stop during holiday time
[0:58:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: with it
[0:58:30] gritbarontv: good or not, they are human
[0:58:32] Sollice: What was the weekly boss this week
[0:58:33] Collected1: Shadowlands launched Nov 23rd, why are we worried about Nov 28th?
[0:58:34] Armdel: that makes blizzard look bad
[0:58:39] captiv8: Then you go touch grass?
[0:58:42] strike879: true vanilla experience again
[0:58:52] Katariatv: Game breaking things should be fixed fast
[0:58:57] ForgottenTime: Depends if the bug is you do 200% more damage or not KEKW
[0:58:59] Analfabestia: wow is not new world, they might have everything ready by Nvember (hopefully)
[0:59:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the release does all depend on if it's ready, the date is secondary
[0:59:26] Alepouditsa: well the did hire more ppl Kappa
[0:59:27] ForgottenTime: If the bug is in player favour it will be fixed that night if not it will be fixed next week KEKW
[0:59:28] Rowini30: idk is it though? do potential players care about it?
[0:59:33] TheRealAxiom: Maybe it’s all hands on deck for DF and they’re working overtime to get it out on time and ready? 🧐
[0:59:34] sttorme31: people dont think about if its a game breaking bug. they would soon be moaning if blizz were on holiday
[0:59:38] Mitune: From what I understand they just said they arent going to tune it for RWF
[0:59:49] Collected1: i don't see the problem with the date
[0:59:49] Sollice: Mor'geth is the weekly boss again
[0:59:50] Sollice: ?
[0:59:51] captiv8: They don’t need the publicity.
[1:00:06] Analfabestia: RWF is way more entertaining than Arena or MDI
[1:00:08] ForgottenTime: I don’t watch MDI cause it’s on YouTube tbh @towelliee
[1:00:11] gidgeet: Couldn’t they launch in mid December then raid to world s first in January?
[1:00:17] KronasKG: I even use RWF as asmr when i goes to bed
[1:00:37] Collected1: when did it start for shadowland
[1:00:40] Collected1: s
[1:00:43] Mitune: eeh
[1:00:44] Thoreya: people take a few days off for christmas..idk why people act like everyone takes multiple weeks off for the holidays. ppl can miss a few days of raid
[1:00:49] Elek77: i'm scared about df release it's too soon
[1:00:52] im_n0t_jezus: give thanks while raiding
[1:00:54] im_n0t_jezus: is the best
[1:00:57] Mitune: Thanksgiving is overrated LUL
[1:01:00] IianaDRK: i dont see them doing anything around thanksgiving cos the devs will want time off themselves
[1:01:09] warrenny: Only usa cares about thanksgiving
[1:01:12] Zuhbuumafu: they're not worried about the world, they're worried about devs in the US not being there if shit breaks
[1:01:19] Collected1: it's not important to marketing. all they care about is box sales.
[1:01:22] ARedBeard: Do any of the Asian countries do christmas?
[1:01:34] Analfabestia: engagement is something that is looked down on and it is actually very important
[1:01:37] Fyris57: @ARedBeard yes lots
[1:01:38] Collected1: if the race was important we'd have a global patch day already
[1:01:43] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple

[1:01:58] Collected1: but they had the same issue with shadowlands surely
[1:01:58] DallTV_: dalldkS dalldkS dalldkS dalldkS dalldkS dalldkS dalldkS
[1:01:59] warrenny: @collected1 Fair
[1:02:01] MILESkg21: no support for raids KEKW

[1:02:18] andre_scb: just realease it next week fuck it Kappa
[1:02:20] DallTV_: i do agree ther4 @Towelliee
[1:02:22] Zuhbuumafu: they've had too much bad press to keep employees there through holidays
[1:02:24] gidgeet: Yep
[1:02:27] Strayer_J: toxic work
[1:02:27] gidgeet: Agree
[1:02:30] iamdjremedy: severs are about to shut down
[1:02:39] amricatt: Companies do have a black out period where it is every hands on deck.  It's not unheard of, especially in IT.
[1:02:47] Mitune: Max did say yesterday that Blizz has launched raids during Christmas quite a bit in the past. Dunno the veracity of that but still
[1:02:52] jmalmin: I think they pushed back a mythic raid a few years ago that would have come out during the christmas break. it was pushed back until 2nd week of January. I am sure this will happen again if it releases  in end of nov
[1:02:54] Daarksyde: towShappens towShappens towShappens
[1:03:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: towCopium releasing raids christmas week would be fine towCopium
[1:03:09] hikaritd: first raid of the expac is always fast and easy, raiders will be able to do Christmas LUL
[1:03:10] Thoreya: also just wanna say WoW has released like 6 expansions during november, im not so sure whats so different this time LUL LUL
[1:03:11] MILESkg21: WOD
[1:03:16] Collected1: they learnt with shadowlands it's not a problem
[1:03:25] Mitune: Nathria
[1:03:28] Mitune: I think
[1:03:29] IianaDRK: nathria is the only other close 1
[1:03:39] Sniqi: but RWF was tiny back then compared to now
[1:03:45] Thoreya: yes 2020
[1:03:57] MarquisLek: shutdown inc
[1:04:41] Thoreya: @Collected1 im with ya lol

[1:05:45] Sniqi: I commented on the Cataclysm raid on christmas :D
[1:05:47] AustinRysk: sorry i was on comercial whats the rolling for?
[1:05:51] AustinRysk: I didnt see a post for it
[1:05:58] S1appadabass: We had this discussion when Shadowlands was coming out, releasing in November/December is pretty much the norm
[1:06:16] Lulaboo: Castle Nathria I think
[1:06:21] Mitune: Didnt ICC break into tiers anyway
[1:06:31] honkblarg: time gating
[1:06:32] jclester: LK was rough
[1:06:34] Mitune: It was broken into segements wasnt it
[1:06:35] Daarksyde: DEFILE OP
[1:06:40] isBadIRL: it took a long time
[1:06:40] dright424: It was gated
[1:06:44] Templexx: all i know is everyone knew the dialog at the end of the fight lmao
[1:06:46] Thoreya: @S1appadabass yeah. more expansions came out in november than not
[1:06:46] GamingDad77: it was time gated
[1:06:46] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it was gated also
[1:06:55] Ordicos: they release it wing at a time
[1:06:56] KaisenSiru: Time gating, that people complain about PepeLaugh
[1:07:17] Mitune: I mean 6 months for all I assume
[1:07:18] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you could have only killed saurfang for the first week then the others opened later
[1:07:22] CajunCrusader: Means you were born to raid!
[1:07:23] ForgottenTime: Is this 24 day?
[1:07:23] bigshovels: till the next raid
[1:07:35] bigshovels: weeks between tier
[1:07:48] Mitune: ah that makes more sense

[1:08:35] dracullus: well it clearly show there were 0 raids released during christmas
[1:08:43] Collected1: the team required to support the race from blizzards perspective is pretty small. it's certainly not all hands on deck.
[1:08:58] gidgeet: I am going with late December release January RWF
[1:09:08] dracullus: it's so funny when people argue about dates you can check in 10 seconds
[1:09:44] spiked16: i think January is for the best
[1:09:46] FatTown: tight like a tiger
[1:09:49] gritbarontv: shadowlands changed that, they have to release on time.
[1:09:52] Sinfever: hey dude hows it hangin
[1:09:59] Phalamore: Do you think the apparent rushed product will affect how good the expansion is?
[1:10:02] S1appadabass: thats a school semester towPog
[1:10:04] unholyshiz: Didn't shadowlands  release in Nov  too? I don't understand what people are on about
[1:10:05] Kinghorn: my backend is ready
[1:10:07] HonestPhilosophy: Was there any update on the AH stuff?
[1:10:08] Klyru: they have to release beta next week or something imo
[1:10:11] Collected1: keep in mind the alpha is old builds
[1:10:15] Sniqi: and what do we learn? Focused Alphas are better than 4 months Alphas :D
[1:10:23] Kinghorn: barbCheeky
[1:10:27] Analfabestia: let's say that they release DH or monk talents this week. Next week the last set of talents. That leaves 3 weeks to test those talents in alfa
[1:10:34] Eggz1004: 299ish
[1:10:34] Thoreya: getting deja vu from the same exact conversations with SL lol
[1:10:36] dracullus: but alpha have different structure, we never had more or less completed zones in first builds
[1:10:37] brewtank: @unholyshiz exactly, they DONT want it to release it at that same time cuz mythic raid will be around Christmas
[1:10:39] MOLAR305: 300 when you logged off
[1:10:45] MrRallek: The AH is insane today
[1:10:48] Rottencoarse: 299 ish @Towelliee  when u logged off
[1:11:04] Kinghorn: that is what it sounded like
[1:11:07] Obidal: Any timeframe on when DH and Monk talent trees will ebcome available on the Alpha?
[1:11:08] Sollice: Price is wrong bitch
[1:11:10] ForgottenTime: That’s a good bud
[1:11:13] ForgottenTime: Bug
[1:11:20] zenFX_: @brewtank they released nathria on christmas, didnt bother them before
[1:11:28] amricatt: Is glyphs included in region wide?  They were super low price this morning.

[1:13:43] Tyldorx: unlucky
[1:13:44] notColt45: Why give me hope Madge
[1:13:48] Armdel: i did not, but im not subbed so i guess i never had a chance anyway
[1:13:49] Murlock07: nada here
[1:13:59] Sollice: Everyone was complaining about the lag in the raid yesterday
[1:14:02] Hyoss: @saltyohm yes, usually
[1:14:06] CaptainDvk: Haha he pressed the wrong cross to close window… don’t know why I find that funny ☺️

[1:14:53] Suwah84: Trying to keep breath up with lag 🤣
[1:14:56] Molvonos: Jailer was kinda weird, with the affix speeding up bomb debuffs.

[1:15:03] pronkk_: no
[1:15:04] Tamz_tv: nope
[1:15:15] strike879: no score means always 200 valor
[1:15:24] brettbeb2421: @towelliee why don’t you stream raid?
[1:15:32] dracullus: they are scraping m+ timewalking next expac, right?
[1:15:36] Mitune: What is is the ilvl for legion m+
[1:15:38] Tyldorx: Anti-Aliasing is so poorly optimized in WoW
[1:15:38] brettbeb2421: Main raid^
[1:15:42] Molvonos: @dracullus ? no?
[1:15:45] Tyldorx: MSAA 8x laggs me and I have a 3070 GPU and good CPU
[1:15:51] Sollice: Friends..Tell me why this isnt working. Why is Bladestorm not working
[1:15:52] Sollice: #showtooltip /cast [@player] Spear of Bastion /cast Bladestorm /use 13
[1:15:55] Jey1h: @strike879 Legion m+ doesnt give valor
[1:16:16] pronkk_: @Towelliee just got a 18 vault
[1:16:18] Molvonos: To my warrior!
[1:16:21] strike879: last time it did so wierd if it doesnt this time
[1:16:24] brettbeb2421: Makes sense
[1:16:29] Orirholim: @Sollice are they both GCD and one of them isn't oGCD?

[1:18:12] thebrosafini: just got dc right after killing fated boss
[1:18:21] Ziephier: at the end of the secenario for Ardenworld and the server shut down
[1:18:26] JediNeo99999: with a rogue you can skip the trash after first boss
[1:18:39] Draz3nx: you can skip last boss with warlock gate
[1:18:43] vic_ave: warlock gate past last trash pack
[1:18:44] Draz3nx: trash
[1:18:54] Orirholim: They could put more BOEs on trash mobs and increase the drop chance a little bit. More people would probably be willing to kill everything.
[1:19:00] gearjammor: The dryad models in that SS are so jarring
[1:19:08] IianaDRK: the raider io route also skips the first coridor of mobs
[1:19:11] akia03: we trade malferion for that bracer
[1:19:31] MrRallek: I'm sure Bliz is loving the fact that the community is so obsessed with Ysera's future
[1:19:51] ashwing_: @akia03 Seems good to me
[1:19:54] clambynature: @Towelliee Did you say something about transmog and gray items?

[1:21:14] Neztrous: is retail down rn
[1:21:14] SpoofAvatar: at least
[1:21:19] Thoreya: i guess AH is a coding nightmare
[1:21:22] Deku_Scrub0: good morning
[1:21:37] Orirholim: that's a coding error
[1:21:40] dracullus: new world drama was probably more entertaining than game
[1:21:46] PokerFaceMoose: they shut down all economic activity not just ah
[1:21:52] MetalHeadTwo: @Towelliee Do you think the Release Date is accurate?
[1:21:52] QuiSiLoR: QuiSiLoR subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Here to watch more alpha later :)
[1:22:01] Effin_Steffin: i made 2.5 million Alliance Side and 3.2 Million Horde side. i killed it selling the progenitor essences since I hoarded shit tons

[1:23:22] ForgottenTime: CN gold farmers were spoofing gold and transferring it to blizzard balance as fast as they could KEKW
[1:23:37] Breakthecause: 10 hours before Blizzard announced the prepatch date
[1:23:39] TAYLOR_HAM: People were receiving gold when they cancelled their auctions, it was counting as sold. Got mats back + gold.  People were making bank lol
[1:23:46] RayenDark: before wrath release date was dropped
[1:23:48] ShowDUH: @Towelliee only WoW DF and D4 is left unconfimed, everything else match it
[1:23:48] magemaster225: it was like early yesterday
[1:23:53] Beud_: Its cut off but right below that it predicts the AH crash Kappa
[1:23:55] dracullus: well to be honest 30th August could be lucky guess, 4 week for pre-patch is not than hard to predict
[1:23:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah!!
[1:24:08] abracka_: @blenders94 that's ring of blood, not brawler's guild
[1:24:10] sh4d0wsky: KEKW

[1:25:01] ashwing_: KEKW
[1:25:09] BigHeroSixy: imagine if WDP is baseline instead of bottom row like it is now.
[1:25:11] Beud_: Yeah Monk and DH are staying on the old talent tree haven't you heard
[1:25:12] lucid_wow: nah its fine dh is gonna make up those 40 talents by making chaos brand a 40 point talent
[1:25:13] dracullus: most reasonable voice on reddit be like
[1:25:13] BigHeroSixy: and monk can have serenity and that
[1:25:18] ruhroraggy: they are not NEW talents though just taken out of spell book
[1:25:19] BigHeroSixy: monk would have the most changes LUL
[1:25:24] lucid_wow: @BigHeroSixy god that would be bis
[1:25:30] Technogre: 40 pts into glide
[1:25:30] warrenny: Same disingenuous bullshit as always

[1:25:39] lucid_wow: i just hope ww doesnt get bdb back
[1:25:39] c0mmander_starscream: INB4 Casual Revolt towOof
[1:25:48] SpoofAvatar: complete loss of systems could bite them in the ass. they did a 180 from too many systems to none
[1:25:55] Funderik: they should be worried, those are the people that cried they were forced to do shit and they was too much.
[1:26:03] Brendo1137: I just hope there’s a zone like ZM
[1:26:06] Durdinn: the people who thought they were literally going to change every class at its core are delusional KEKW what were they expecting wow 2.0
[1:26:06] dracullus: "what is there to do beside these 10 things I just listed"
[1:26:08] GamingDad77: <--casual player. Could care less. Nothing we can do about it.
[1:26:35] Kellorian: Use it , or lose it
[1:26:43] ZetYokai: thats ancient
[1:26:44] Collected1: WFH kinda changes that somewhat
[1:26:44] HonestPhilosophy: I get 20 a year, no roll over
[1:27:00] Sollice: I put it in for the week after Thanksgiving just in case. I have 225 hours of PLT banked right now....So I can take the week of regardless lol
[1:27:01] ZetYokai: KEKW
[1:27:06] the_general01: @ZetYokai and yet its still a thing lol

[1:27:08] ShadowDMG6969: Alot of places still have uise it or lose it
[1:27:15] Scoodles91: i got days from 2020 still :D
[1:27:24] ZetYokai: @the_general01, no shot, murica?
[1:27:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think there will be more world content that we haven't seen yet in the alpha
[1:27:35] beezly33: I can carry over 40 hours but need to use it by April 1st the following year or I lose it
[1:27:37] the_general01: @ZetYokai sigh...sadly
[1:27:46] Korupcija_: sure Kappa
[1:28:01] Thoreya: ppl saying mid december for a release. all people crazy LUL
[1:28:01] ZetYokai: @the_general01 the american dream 💀

[1:28:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, we will have things to do, I bet
[1:28:32] gearjammor: Is renown replacing reputation?
[1:28:36] crazypillz_pk: pkchurchpk subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:28:39] zenFX_: Wrath released in November, Cataclysm released in november, WoD released in november, never moaned about first raid coming out over christmas before, dont use the excuse now
[1:28:46] Thoreya: SL was not broken at launch!!!
[1:28:50] Thoreya: wtf are people talking about
[1:29:01] Funderik: or launched early
[1:29:04] DAN_I_E_L_: not broken, just bad
[1:29:09] quju_: ^
[1:29:16] Frank4LuLz: fucking haters
[1:29:20] KaisenSiru: That's right you tell them! put them in their place! Preach it!
[1:29:22] Thoreya: broken =/= them not changing covenants
[1:29:22] thebakeriscomingforu: just grindy systems
[1:29:23] kaldoroth: WoD was broken with garison buggs and phasing :D
[1:29:24] Funderik: it launches exactly when blizzard intend it too, it's players that keep saying it's early/too soon.
[1:29:27] sh4d0wsky: players are brokeN
[1:29:37] lucid_wow: SL launch was surprisingly smooth they just had some really godawful decisions made (locked covenants, conduit energy, eye of the jailer, etc)
[1:29:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: There were some bugs, but yeah I wouldn't say they were broken
[1:29:51] dracullus: last really broken launch was in 2014
[1:29:54] Thoreya: only bug i remember that was bad was necrotic wake
[1:29:55] ZuggSpeedman: yea convoke was totally fine on release for pvp
[1:29:59] Quakezilla69: For me, I do not care about content coming out around xmas. Just another day
[1:30:07] BigHeroSixy: I think the worst thing at both releases is something that only plagues fully servers. BFA had the nathanos vial bug.
[1:30:13] Funderik: it launches when blizzard feels it ready. it's that simple
[1:30:14] Frank4LuLz: World Of Brokencraft
[1:30:15] ZuggSpeedman: that's tuning tho
[1:30:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Convoke was definitely not tuned properly LUL
[1:30:21] BigHeroSixy: But thats always a day 1 thing cause its overpopulated
[1:30:30] TheCheeseWheel87: The same people saying release is too early are the same people that voted for Grim Rail. Change my mind
[1:30:31] Breakthecause: Global launch has been amazing
[1:30:34] IianaDRK: since wod there hasnt been a bad launch
[1:30:36] Thunder4o: whiners gonna whine
[1:30:38] lucid_wow: @dangermouse93 balancing issue, the game itself was stable and fine it just had issues with dev philosophy vs player philosophy
[1:30:40] ohnot___her: BfA was TRASH
[1:30:44] Redpandalol: I can’t think of anyone that enjoyed azerite armour in place of tier
[1:30:46] Strayer_J: SL was the smoothest i can recall
[1:30:49] BigHeroSixy: Yeah I couldnt play my illidan character for 2 days for BFA LUL
[1:30:51] Bigvont: WoD lounch was mess, yep :D
[1:30:52] temp3st98: some for bfa
[1:30:53] PatchesMcPatch: yeah, broken implies buggy and not working as intended.  broken was never the case.  only crying players
[1:30:53] Breakthecause: WOD Global Launch took forever!!
[1:30:55] mrmanno14: SL launch prob one of the best times I’ve had in WoW
[1:31:00] MarquisLek: ring of blood
[1:31:00] tocu: I think its more condeming that the game has lauched good but the game was a bad game because they didnt listen to any player feedback
[1:31:05] roodenburgertje: People always try to find something to get mad on from blizzard
[1:31:05] Neowanderer: bfa had the big servers borked for like a day it wasnt too bad all in all
[1:31:07] Strayer_J: @shreks13inchuncuthog youre trash
[1:31:07] the_general01: i miss Brawlers Guild
[1:31:10] Thoreya: @mrmanno14 same. the first month of SL was super fucking fun
[1:31:12] TomCat: That Pandaria beta though... how fast did it break... 1 minute?
[1:31:14] flebbooo: I didn't get to create my garrison until i was lvl 100 KEKW
[1:31:14] DeanoTV: still remember WOD launch being on the news KEKW
[1:31:27] procyon_mfc: You can still do it and it's scaled to your level yes
[1:31:27] temp3st98: no
[1:31:28] Frank4LuLz: the ring
[1:31:28] ohnot___her: @Strayer_J Nice one :)
[1:31:28] lucid_wow: honestly SL launch was really fun it just got really stale after the first month when everyone quit
[1:31:32] Rudric_Ice: no
[1:31:33] temp3st98: i dont think sp
[1:31:34] the_general01: the knuckles are there
[1:31:40] Strayer_J: @shreks13inchuncuthog see how opinions work
[1:31:41] the_general01: i think
[1:31:41] killercondon: Nope
[1:31:46] Mitune: They need to make Darkmoon faire and Brawlers guild much bigger things going forward
[1:31:48] Frank4LuLz: always love getting hearth toys or rings
[1:31:58] the_general01: i know the mount is gone, for sure
[1:32:10] Thoreya: besides soar
[1:32:10] procyon_mfc: I tried Brawlers Guild last week and it felt scaled to my character
[1:32:16] Thoreya: oh god please dont mention soar to people
[1:32:21] ohnot___her: @Strayer_J Didn't need to be educated about opinions but thanks?
[1:32:28] Frank4LuLz: until the next leak
[1:32:35] Thoreya: SO CHILL WITH UR FAMILY AND RAID 2 DAYS LATER
[1:32:37] Thoreya: reeeee
[1:32:47] Kneckt: feeling guilty about raid really isnt blizzards problem IMO lol
[1:32:54] DAN_I_E_L_: Couldn't they just delay the raid release?
[1:33:03] PatchesMcPatch: @Kneckt yeah true
[1:33:09] Mitune: If you are a part of a guild that makes you feel guilty about a raid during christmas then thats a you problem
[1:33:14] zenkodac: exactly neither we or him have that power
[1:33:17] Thoreya: ^^^^^
[1:33:34] Armdel: actiblizz got that whip out saying they need a release for that fiscal quarter
[1:33:37] Thoreya: people do not take multiple weeks off for christmas im sorry. thats not normal in NA
[1:33:37] gritbarontv: like it should be, people have to take their time
[1:33:40] Thunder4o: that would be terrabad
[1:33:41] Funderik: MOST people get time off during chrismas, so idk. if you can't raid, your problem
[1:33:48] Reckless_Monk: Only WF raiders get the shitty end of the stick here. everyone else can just start next week after the raid is release.
[1:33:55] Warcraftthor: they could have a preseason
[1:33:58] DAN_I_E_L_: You could with capped gear, would be weird though
[1:34:04] lucid_wow: honestly the raid release coinciding with christmas is more of a regular player issue than an rwf issue, rwf players are just gonna raid regardless, but regular people who dont wanna raid over christmas can just take a week off raiding realistically and it doesnt matter
[1:34:04] ShadowDMG6969: Taking at least a week or longer is the norm for alot of Jobs
[1:34:06] Kneckt: MOST regular people would choose playing over family, thats just the way it is lol. most ppl who say otherwise r full of it
[1:34:08] Reckless_Monk: I dont get it why the community think they have to Raid
[1:34:20] Thoreya: @Kneckt thats exaclty it lol
[1:34:25] JediNeo99999: Why release a raid when people will ignore it for a week? That's just silly
[1:34:28] Armdel: the thing is, noone wants a raid to release only for them to immediately have to go on a break
[1:34:28] StoneFaceWoW: It's a non-issue. Skip a few days of raiding, it's a non-issue give me a break
[1:34:35] lucid_wow: like its a complete non-issue for RWF players but i feel like if u arent at an RWF level ur guild can just take a week off raiding
[1:34:44] Reckless_Monk: Its not a 1% problem, im saying the community has this mind set that their guild has to raid day 1
[1:34:44] Thoreya: people are just upset that they have to spend time with their family instead of raiding when it launches
[1:34:45] TweektheProphet: My guild doesn't start raiding until week 2 of raid
[1:34:50] zenkodac: i agree but also i think people could be mature about it and delay their progress for a week for the health of their guilds
[1:34:56] gritbarontv: lol
[1:34:57] Moobot: Read all about the new Auction House changes at https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23833174/shadowlands-927-update-notes
[1:35:03] Qazroth: for someone looking to come back to wow, who hasnt played sisnce last season of bfa, would you recommend comming back now or when dragonflight launches?
[1:35:05] Funderik: it would be a good time to watch it too, during the holidays.
[1:35:10] Reckless_Monk: of course they aent
[1:35:11] Thoreya: well then thats their problem
[1:35:12] Reckless_Monk: arent
[1:35:13] Thoreya: like what
[1:35:18] Kneckt: thats the players problem tho
[1:35:18] the_general01: it is still all about being number one.
[1:35:20] Kneckt: not the companys
[1:35:20] Brendo1137: @towelliee what if they release a fated old raid in the mean time and then they release the main raid after the holiday?
[1:35:22] Reckless_Monk: But cant blame Blizzard for release soming
[1:35:23] the_general01: at the end of the day
[1:35:25] killercondon: If they wanna raid instead of being with fam then thats on them
[1:35:30] Thoreya: it literally is
[1:35:35] lucid_wow: @Qazroth this season is pretty fun and you can get gear and prep your characters for DF if u resub now
[1:35:40] TomCat: prioritizing health over raid progress?!? filthy casuals!
[1:35:50] Kneckt: thats how the world works though
[1:35:58] gritbarontv: if you want to be hardcore, don't have a family, lol
[1:36:02] Armdel: for someone people, christmas is the only time they have time to visit relatives
[1:36:04] Thoreya: idk man i disagree
[1:36:07] Funderik: it will never work for everyone.
[1:36:08] Thoreya: were adults
[1:36:08] Qazroth: @Qazroth yeah probably will end up doing so
[1:36:09] Quakezilla69: Works good for me, full send
[1:36:15] Kinghorn: spoilers, there is no release time that works for everyone
[1:36:15] Thoreya: can make decisions
[1:36:24] Qazroth: @Qazroth been hearing the same thing for multiple people
[1:36:30] magemaster225: prepatch colliding with god of war ragnarok ugh
[1:36:31] Ponzie: January takes it to the next quarter
[1:36:31] gritbarontv: no, i would be where's my content, lol
[1:36:32] Short_Film: I read Gurgthock wrong .....
[1:36:34] Collected1: i'm sure we had the exact same conversation with shadowlands
[1:36:34] Korupcija_: just watched your clip of getting King's rest mount on EU, went for a run and got it too LUL
[1:36:37] Bigvont: Bobby Kotick would not be fine with that
[1:36:37] Ertra: then people would freak out because it wasn't by end of the year
[1:36:38] Reckless_Monk: If you make a game your entire life if you aint a pro, or a streamer.. then your life is kinda bleak
[1:36:38] Try_Nothing: nope
[1:36:40] TweektheProphet: I work from home so not looking fwd to if raid is around christmas time I would prefer to spend that time away from the house
[1:36:41] Ponzie: Doesn't align with quaterly goals
[1:36:42] Brodih_: but then they think of quarter 4 sale numbers
[1:36:43] gearjammor: aren't they aiming for 2022?
[1:36:44] warrenny: Do it more wrath
[1:36:46] spookychefkarolina: New year new expansion. It’s not hard blizzard.
[1:36:49] gritbarontv: s4 sucks
[1:36:51] lucid_wow: issue is i dont think they can push it back to mid-january bc they already have it announced by the end of the year
[1:36:51] HighThereBud: @Ponzie So what
[1:36:52] Alepouditsa: i like it on holly days
[1:36:53] Rudric_Ice: i hope DF doesn't come out this year cuz i am moving to paris and i dont wanna miss out on launch PepeHands
[1:36:56] Thoreya: oh now its their problem LUL LUL
[1:36:59] Thoreya: for january
[1:37:00] Funderik: "leak" pinch of salt
[1:37:03] CushyPop: Got to meet those quarterly goals
[1:37:08] the_general01: theyve got wrath and OW2 to help
[1:37:11] rufphus: Not everyone would say “ok cool”. Blizzard said they’d release by 2022 so there will be people upset if it doesn’t come out.
[1:37:14] TheItalianStallion321: @lucid_wow they can do whatever they want lol
[1:37:15] jiffynuts: Shareholders and board members want their sweet sweet q4 profits
[1:37:17] AveragePvp: Mid January would work amazing, I could take so much time off work
[1:37:19] Armdel: cod also releases late october
[1:37:23] Kinghorn: OW2 barbKEK
[1:37:26] Molvonos: "but Daaad, I don't WANT to touch grass, gosh."
[1:37:27] Phalamore: Wonder when they are gonna come out with the monetization things for WoTLK like the boosts?
[1:37:33] zenkodac: doesnt sound like something activision shareholders feel very relatable when the option is delaying their profit even if it was a delay to mak more after
[1:37:48] ohnot___her: Cant release in 2023. Blizz obviously wants to release in 2022
[1:37:53] HighThereBud: It's not numbers dude
[1:37:57] Orirholim: @zenkodac microsoft shareholders too
[1:37:59] the_general01: @Kinghorn its hilarious but the battle pass is going to make them money hand over fist.
[1:38:01] Teknofear64: I thought restarts generally only take a few minutes, this is more like a patch
[1:38:04] rufphus: Why is it “their problem” if they’re not happy with a late launch but it’s not “their problem” for a bad raid launch time frame
[1:38:11] rnielsen297: to late
[1:38:21] mozavich: blizzard has never really cared about player schedules though - they released original wow 2 days before thanksgiving 11/23/04
[1:38:36] Collected1: LUL good luck with that post covid

[1:38:41] Kinghorn: did you piss off the new arbiter
[1:38:42] Collected1: every single game is getting delayed these days
[1:38:43] andre_scb: its 2022 there is no such thing as release dates Kappa
[1:38:45] warrenny: @rufphus Because people are stupid
[1:38:50] TheItalianStallion321: you gained like 120 ilvls or something last time you played
[1:38:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  if you need a dps lemme know i can come with my warr
[1:39:24] zvj0: thas eu?
[1:39:25] Collected1: giving dates early only causes trouble down the road. it's just not worth the trouble.
[1:39:41] zenkodac: the raid and weekly should be enough in terms of flux if you cant send some
[1:39:51] Sollice: @Collected1 I would agree that would be true in any other kind of game, but MMOs like this people do plan things around release
[1:40:08] warrenny: @collected1 They shouldve just said 2023 to be safe
[1:40:28] backerxx: is WoW the only game in the world where people complain content is released too slowly and then complain that releases come to early?
[1:40:37] Collected1: Sollice : true but then they delay and suddenly everyone is slamming them who can't reverse their holiday bookings at work.

[1:41:33] ronny_84: what's the difference people are gonna play wow either way  during Christmas
[1:41:34] Sollice: @Collected1 Oh your 100% right. People are never going to be happy. I deal with the same thing in my work life with Go Live dates. That being said you HAVE to give the people you work with ( or in this case fans ) some sort of a date. Put a big ***DATE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE *** kind of thing but you have to give them something
[1:41:36] Moose_Ka: playerbase is becoming boomers. they have to be entitled
[1:41:40] Kneckt: This is the way
[1:41:41] TomCat: Software development is like a cross-country road trip... except there are no roads and the map is drawn on a napkin... but the kids are still in the back seat asking "Are we there yet?!?" every 10 minutes

[1:43:34] SSD511_: People after killing the lich king cata hype LUL
[1:43:35] Collected1: Sollice : i'd rather just get a date once they're 100% confident they'll hit it. less drama all round really. as much as i'd love to know now.
[1:43:49] TheItalianStallion321: Legion still my TOP 2 best expansion
[1:43:51] Frenaris: Legion launch was so hype. Getting your artifacts, start unlocking your traits etc, class halls. Coming up on 6 year anniversary for it now
[1:43:56] Mobius624: How is Towelliee in the game right now/...EU server?
[1:43:58] TweektheProphet: shadowland at least pushed you into an instance space for a bit kinda giving everyone a breakout spot, I think that helped alot
[1:44:05] uhhhhyeayoo: Much more reasonable for long downtime given the technology and manpower they were working with. Obviously expectations of serviced has rises with the expanse and success of the game, and the company working on it.
[1:44:11] Sollice: @Collected1 Thats a solid ask
[1:44:19] Rudric_Ice: hope we can duel in main city in DF

[1:46:14] Rudric_Ice: hows the weather in cali ?
[1:46:16] Sollice: Every single company that has maintenance windows should learn the #1 FUNDAMENTAL RULE.....Always OVER QUOTE how long your downtime will take. It comes up quicker you look amazing, if it takes the amount of time you need than people can't ( somehow they will ) get pissed

[4:06:12] Robodope: the DH talent tree's gonna be three buttons in a straight line and you know it
[4:06:15] lithium364: im sure the windwalker bugs keep delaying the update Kappa
[4:06:26] lucid_wow: hard doubt it but i think it looks way better if every class is available in the last alpha build vs pushing 1 back to beta
[4:06:39] cappei: @Robodope Glide and Double Jump as talents PepeLaugh
[4:06:57] lucid_wow: @lithium364 8751825 storm earth and fire bugs found with another 1237573815087173 waiting to be found

[4:08:14] 91Niki: It always sucks to be last
[4:08:15] cappei: Eh, the Monk community isn't bad. Now DH, yeah..
[4:08:21] strike879: DH are not prepared to wait
[4:08:22] Gichio: WW is tired of getting boned lol
[4:08:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomkins still want more changes to their trees, but they aren't as vocal
[4:08:28] 91Niki: Exactly @Jarlan23
[4:08:31] lucid_wow: monk and dh are the 2 least played classes in the game atm too if im not mistaken
[4:08:32] Robodope: mistweaver been forgotten about like 3 expansions straight
[4:08:38] nethose: Dont you mean mistweaver?
[4:08:38] lucid_wow: imagine something like hunter wasnt out yet
[4:08:39] 91Niki: @Gichio LAWL try being a feral druid KEKW
[4:08:41] Nnaps: i just need my pre expac Evoker pls
[4:08:43] Mitune: Its been the same build for 3 expansion is what they mean
[4:08:50] 91Niki: Cry me a fucking river LUL
[4:09:00] Gichio: echoing my friend lol I'm a dirty lock
[4:09:08] Mitune: A feral what? They dont exist
[4:09:14] Retpally9329: is it amplified though? there have been trees out since the beginning of alpha with multiple iterations and some classes get nothing yet
[4:09:16] BigHeroSixy: Feral Pepehand
[4:09:19] lucid_wow: @Mitune  wym same build for the last 3 expansions? current build is even less fun than how its been KEKW
[4:09:22] Obitualist: As a WW, can confirm
[4:09:22] Gichio: my brother mains feral SeemsGood
[4:09:28] cappei: This is a scaley expac. Furries sit down

[4:09:42] 91Niki: @Gichio Your brother is a man of class SeemsGood
[4:09:57] CritcobainTV: that's cause they broke boomkins LUL
[4:10:02] Gichio: he's a fucking psycho he's played it since mop @91niki
[4:10:02] lucid_wow: oh yeah boomkin is swamp ass in m+ rn
[4:10:05] 91Niki: Yeah cuz boomy was actually broken, like bad broken LUL
[4:10:08] lucid_wow: thank god for that fuck boomkins
[4:10:10] Mitune: @lucid_wow I mean more specifically WDP and SEF. Rarely Serenity. Chiji was new but yeah its just a proc more than a new build
[4:10:15] Jarlan23: no one plays feral much so if you get one theyre usually dedicated and know their shit
[4:10:31] lucid_wow: @Mitune  oh yeah no true im just saying fuck dance of chiji fuck bdb lmao
[4:10:33] Gichio: ^
[4:10:57] Mitune: @lucid_wow true fun for a bit but sucks when its so inconsistent
[4:11:10] 91Niki: @Jarlan23 Not entirely true. There is a lot of people who play feral who has zero clue what is going on, which often give feral the bad rep. Feral is a hard class to master, so there is long between the good ones, sadly
[4:11:17] Mecabeast: personally feel like hunters in general are way to strong
[4:11:43] Novasfrost: Been feral since I started in burning crusade, I love them too much to change spec lol
[4:12:13] 91Niki: @Novasfrost Mood! Since late cata though. It's so fucking rewarding when you get high dps numbers, cuz of the complexity, compared to other classes
[4:12:14] CritcobainTV: adds detonate after not being killed
[4:12:29] SinicalDev: eu is turbo fucked atm, cant zone anywhere else because of instance not found
[4:12:42] Bleedorang3: Marks hunters in PvP are legit broken
[4:12:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, survival picked up a lot of steam, year of the spear
[4:12:51] cappei: *cough* Warlock and Mage *cough*
[4:12:52] the_spiritist: anyone else have No realm are available right now?
[4:12:58] NewWorldReign: Isnt Infernal the same as Volcanic?
[4:12:58] UltiCarnagee: Warlocks and Fire Mages Main characters YEP
[4:12:58] Gichio: you're describing destro lock
[4:13:02] lucid_wow: i mean unfortunately it makes sense especially for hunter, one of if not the single most played class in the game, its gonna be strong
[4:13:03] RadRage69: MM hunter pumps
[4:13:06] Kinghorn: pure dps classes are usually strong because 1/3 trees will probably be good
[4:13:07] theDirtyon3: Lock at the top YEP
[4:13:09] jolehin: Guys why ppl doing these other dungeons that are not in rotation? How are they even scaled im super confused
[4:13:18] NVbrutal: the tier is only thing making surv really strong right now tho take that away and they fall down to b or c tier imo
[4:13:21] akia03: surv only because tier set without it they are useless again and forgotten
[4:13:27] geokouts: LOL i cant get from Zereth Mortis to Oribos through the portal!
[4:13:36] Gichio: @jolehin it's part of legion time walking
[4:13:46] jolehin: @Gichio Aaaa okay
[4:13:54] the_spiritist: Are the EU servers down for anyone else atm?
[4:13:58] lucid_wow: @NVbrutal  probably lower than that tbh, survival without tier is actually tragic and just does like 0 damage
[4:14:21] hikaritd: eu is up wtf
[4:14:23] DeanoTV: nope theyre up
[4:14:23] geokouts: i am online and i CANT get to Oribos through the ortal

[4:22:00] hikaritd: Sargeras being vacuumed from Azeroth = epic af
[4:22:02] NetherRegion: Saurfang was the OG
[4:22:07] ArcaneMaki: Real emotions. Not fake emotions like Variann jump for no reason off the freaking airship. Such a faked scenario.
[4:22:12] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: I still remember when BC came out and people attacked the pitbosses and crashed the dam thing
[4:22:19] Karn1987: Garrosh did nuthing wrong
[4:22:24] falldrgn: Saurfangs son's Death in ICC was a legit tear jerker as well
[4:22:27] Mecabeast: gave me chills thinking about it
[4:22:37] spookychefkarolina: I feel like all the cinematics are so well done and are good at pulling emotional heartstrings

[4:23:32] ArcaneMaki: The cinematic where Saurfang hold his son chest in Icecrown hit me right in the feelz.
[4:23:53] NewWorldReign: What I dont understand is, now that Sylvanas got her soul back. Is she now a Blood Elf again?
[4:24:00] Bestbud: @SollowJP no reason? did you see the cinematic? theres a giant infernal holding onto the ship lmao

[4:29:14] flebbooo: KEKW too real

[4:30:14] DrkPhoenix6913: @Narktali nothing better to do ;) haha
[4:30:16] SpoofAvatar: He tweeted the warcraft devs on it
[4:30:25] Agronair: Thanks for bringing me in for the vault runs, first time i've gotten to run with, sorry it was on my shitty shaman. lol
[4:31:07] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  have u seen the D4 leaks on wowhead?
[4:31:15] spookychefkarolina: Random question but I’ve never heard you talk about it. What do you think of MoP Towel? Was it bad? I stopped playing shortly before that time so I never got to experience it.
[4:31:17] Narktali: @DrkPhoenix6913 I farm the expeditions every day
[4:31:23] Rottencoarse: https://www.wowhead.com/news/diablo-iv-leaks-and-rumors-are-mounting-328384?webhook @Towelliee
[4:31:25] flebbooo: fair enough
[4:31:25] TheItalianStallion321: do you have confidence Towel? i personally dont either
[4:31:31] lithium364: can you answer that tweet with "feral"
[4:31:32] hikaritd: DF is almost boring, zero systems, they have to tune nothing, why would it be ready? LUL
[4:31:34] Exxcar: @Towelliee what do you think? Ready in Dec?
[4:31:43] Arbszy: Bobby trying to get that holiday money before he flies the coop in June.
[4:31:48] raldrik: I see 12 hours of content and months of balance changes
[4:31:57] DeanoTV: i think theyll delay to feb
[4:32:02] Yagr6: they banned pvpers so we dont have to test it
[4:32:18] Coffenatic: I agree with Ted
[4:32:19] Narktali: @DrkPhoenix6913 for the parangon ^^
[4:32:21] DrkPhoenix6913: @DrkPhoenix6913 @Narktali  i just do dailies here and there still waiting to get my last 2 pieces of Unity :P  Such a pain
[4:32:25] Retpally9329: Sloot rarely wrong he always looks at things from every perspective
[4:32:28] emznev: Just do Q1 2023 i have wotlk to play for a few months XD
[4:32:30] Mitune: They can delay all they want as long as they release the talents to live soone rrather than later
[4:32:48] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: The monday before Thanksgiving
[4:32:54] Narktali: @DrkPhoenix6913 haha
[4:33:08] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: and then raids go live after the new year
[4:33:13] Exxcar: But Kottick wants that Holiday money
[4:33:16] Contendedlemon: the great push trailer looks good @Towelliee
[4:33:18] lithium364: can they release it and just say we dont need raids to open 2 weeks later just enjoy base leveling and professions and see you raiding in 2023
[4:33:21] Arbszy: Also Housing hunting is exhausting too
[4:33:29] kyr_slowbro: I'd support Q1 2023 release, holiday releases are cringe
[4:33:32] HaloS23: @Towelliee whats got him turned off? just falling out of WOW?
[4:33:33] MysticalOS: I mean the alpha barely has any content yet, hasn't even started M+ testing, which usually draws sloot out
[4:33:36] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  maybe he's burned down due to world first stuff? and he just found a new house so
[4:33:41] JukasZor: @Towelliee what's a good resource to learn the fated raids on at least Normal from a tank perspective.  I know dungeon journal but it doesn't cover things like tank swaps etc
[4:33:48] lele_iO: hey, can someone tell me the name or where to get this shoulders?
[4:34:15] Aldria_: Vacay, covid & house hunting might give enough distractions :P
[4:34:22] Nico_vdM: emerald nightmare for the shoulders
[4:34:24] Orion280: could it also just be him burnt out cause of shadowlands?
[4:34:24] Nico_vdM: last boss
[4:34:26] HaloS23: emerald nightmare raid
[4:34:30] Aldria_: Valid point though
[4:34:36] brighadoon: January, the perfect month for video game releases 🙄. I mean who releases video games in the fall?

[4:34:43] BigHeroSixy: I usually devote 2 or 3 days depending on whats released each week. Once mythic dungeons come out I'll be on there daily.
[4:34:43] sentokiisarg87: I think he is just getting burnt out of wow entirely not a DF issue really.
[4:34:52] SilkeySmooth: catering to the 1%
[4:34:59] emznev: I HOPE DF gives me a reason to log in every day because shadowlands did not make me want to log in once in the last 2 years lol
[4:34:59] kyr_slowbro: Q1 2022 had so many banger game releases it was crazy
[4:34:59] PrimalRain: Applebiscuit everyone trying to get that holiday money
[4:35:12] vi0lencioax3man: they'll release DF in october :)
[4:35:13] itsbananas01: KEKW Gamer
[4:35:18] theDirtyon3: BASED
[4:35:24] mavericks312: big facts thd
[4:35:30] lithium364: yeah release it on the night of new year Kappa
[4:35:36] TheItalianStallion321: im Italian. if im not with family on Christmas, i can get disowned
[4:35:39] Artiiz: True, a lot of people feel alone during christmas holidays etc and they tend to get into games to get away from that anxiety
[4:35:43] Jarlan23: christmas is a one or two day event here its nbd
[4:35:44] SilkeySmooth: expect dragonflight to be delayed
[4:35:45] bigcountry555: its christmas eve for our fam
[4:35:46] NaoriMMO: NaoriMMO subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[4:35:50] MysticalOS: I don't understand the people who say a christmas release only affects 1%. such a bad take. normal/heroic is raiding too for many.
[4:35:50] Coffenatic: Same for my Italian fam - couldn't do shit for days haha
[4:35:51] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @theitalianstallion321 1000%
[4:35:54] MrGrimms: so much food around christmas time with a cuban family lol
[4:36:07] DubakuMatumbo: Cant undersatnd those demands tho ...
[4:36:10] DrkPhoenix6913: before i moved away from Jersey it was the same... Xmas Eve and Xmas were like completely off limits or risk death
[4:36:18] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @theitalianstallion321 Italian/Irish i get it lol
[4:36:24] Exxcar: I would be fine if the expansion launched in Nov, but we didn't get raid on M+ until Jan
[4:36:36] Exxcar: Give people time to enjoy leveling, alts and world content
[4:36:43] Exxcar: before the endgame grind begins
[4:36:43] Moobot: Read all about the new Auction House changes at https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23833174/shadowlands-927-update-notes
[4:36:58] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @exxcar thats my opinion i think thats how they should do it
[4:36:59] JukasZor: @Exxcar ppl will get bored with 2 months of nothing but m0
[4:37:03] MysticalOS: and that's just mythic. I remember when cataclysm launched.. it also had december raid release. at time I wasn't a super cutting edge raider, but it still fucked our normal modes.
[4:37:03] Contendedlemon: id have all my alts max geared by then lol
[4:37:04] PvtHudson093: I prefer to slack off in front of the TV during Xmas
[4:37:08] Onearmyof2: true
[4:37:31] Arbszy: Cataclysm had 2 raid tiers over christmas
[4:37:36] Coffenatic: @Exxcar I think they used to release xpacs in Nov, but the release schedule has been scuffed the past few
[4:37:37] Eggz1004: save launch for after xmas, make sure game is solid first
[4:37:38] lithium364: release it september i say
[4:37:41] mrrazputin: What is there to do in dragon flight at max lvl ? did they add anything ?
[4:37:42] lithium364: Kappa
[4:37:44] Tyldorx: bro, raiding with the boys during christmas sounds cozy af
[4:37:45] Tyldorx: Pog
[4:37:49] axellent_x: the moving goal posts in the argument is funny, ppl actin like they don't want to have the devs workin durin holidays but god forbid maintenance goes an extra hr and ppl rage
[4:37:51] Mecabeast: i have a 15 after this id

[4:37:51] bigoldmeatpie: i don't even care about the raid from a player perspective. i don't want the raid over christmas because i don't want the engineers to have to have to work that hard on the holiday
[4:38:13] zgag: @Eggz1004 That would tuff. Most people take 2-4 weeks of vacation around that time
[4:38:14] MysticalOS: and also consider M+ and how players are there. lets say M+ is open in december, but you go do things with family, by the time you come back, pug are already gonna be like "oh you don't know the dungeon route already? kick"
[4:38:15] Exxcar: @JukasZor I mean its the holiday season, as has been said most people will be more focused on the holidays than the game
[4:38:28] Exxcar: The people who no-life the game are going to get bored no matter what you do
[4:38:33] Eggz1004: or launch it the week of xmas, then the devs can enjoy they holidays and be back to work to fix the remaining bugs
[4:38:39] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @axellent_x it isnt that i care if they work its the fact they wont lol
[4:38:47] xxCameleon77xx: Your fonts and setup look really good. Is there a link setup on your site? I would prefer to not use a UI addon
[4:38:52] MysticalOS: right that's what I mean
[4:38:57] MysticalOS: if they open raids AND M+
[4:38:58] grumpnamedjosh: we don't really know how long it will take to hit that wall in professions outside what we see in alpha with free mats and prof talent upgrades
[4:38:59] Archiee: pretty much yeah
[4:39:12] zgag: Unless we want a February release
[4:39:12] MysticalOS: but i'm just saying people keep calling it a 1% problem and it's not
[4:39:14] dmarinn: Lauch in december delay raid ?
[4:39:31] Zip13: Raid and m+/pvp season start the same day LUL wth is chat on

They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[4:39:35] Yagr6: this game is not that serious imo, people need to chill and go with the flow bb
[4:39:38] Exxcar: @Towelliee he's saying that releasing both during the holidays will be negative because a lot of players won't be able partake because of the holidays
[4:39:43] zgag: Release should be revolve around the WF race
[4:39:54] zgag: What ever is the best time is the best time
[4:39:57] Zip13: 2-3 weeks after launch stuff starts
[4:39:58] DiiscoViking: got my advance starter kit, that sticker is metalic, nice
[4:40:25] Zip13: This will be no different from shadowlands launch schedule
[4:40:28] Archiee: for bliz it's a money game
[4:40:35] Arbszy: But why do they have to delay it? 🤔 The 1% isnt complaining, if your casual like me who cares. I loved when Endwalker launched last December.
[4:40:40] brighadoon: Why do you think most games come out around November? It’s because ppl have time and money
[4:40:50] Pey0: Q1 is usually a down time for business
[4:40:52] bigcountry555: if  hardcore raiders dont want to play during the holiday then they dont really want to win
[4:40:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sales are better in the fall, tho
[4:40:52] Ezmaraldaa: doesn't bother me, it would be nice for the holidays
[4:40:54] HonestPhilosophy: In the end they'll release it when they want so nothing anyone can really control
[4:41:00] mrrazputin: Isnt mid january the china new year ?
[4:41:00] brewgamingtv: I've been saying start of 2023 is best no holiday to mess with any of the expac
[4:41:01] Archiee: they don't profit from rwf nearly as much as they profit from the holidays. It's kinda a no brainer to get it out on time
[4:41:03] SinicalDev: Blizz shouldn't really release it according to streamers etc. It's up to the streamer to decide if they want to get the gravy train or not
[4:41:03] procyon_mfc: When do you think Arclight will come out?
[4:41:06] UltiCarnagee: Then Activision Execs get mad cause they can't maximize Q4 profits KEKW
[4:41:06] ArcaneMaki: It just sucks a bit for some of us that would like to use holidays vacation to play.
[4:41:06] SilkeySmooth: i actually agree mid jan launch
[4:41:07] Monsterix: can't wait till january dude
[4:41:10] unholyshiz: bobby  needs a new boat tho
[4:41:11] TheCliffyShow: They got most fo there sales with preorder anway.
[4:41:13] dmarinn: diablo 4 in 2023 q1
[4:41:14] Rob3phones: Couldnt they do mid December and than the race be the 1st week of January if they stick to a q4 launch
[4:41:18] XiMoee: why would an average casual player care that much about raiding in christmas ?
[4:41:19] Yagr6: diablo is launching early next year
[4:41:19] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:41:20] Bleedorang3: I'd like to play it over the holidays personally but I can see both points of view
[4:41:23] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:41:24] Onearmyof2: wasnt diablo leaked for beginning of the new year?
[4:41:28] MrGrimms: @Towelliee it would be weird for them to release it during that time as well since they shut down for those last 2 weeks of december, so it would be a skeleton crew running support/devs
[4:41:31] Eggz1004: launch it on the 27th, its after Xmas and its before what they announced as a release date
[4:41:32] NiksonGB: nahh christman is the best launch
[4:41:32] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: lul
[4:41:34] Velashen: No company will ever say they are making *enough* though lol
[4:41:35] axellent_x: "dont release it this day blizz, its bad for me, ergo its bad for others"
[4:41:37] zgag: I wouldn't see it release in January if the release goes past Nov/Dec.  If it did it would have a February release
[4:41:40] RocketMan23: its going to launch when it launches, personally id like it over the holidays other people dont, its whatever
[4:41:46] Exxcar: @TheCliffyShow There is a VERY large portion of the playerbase that doesn't buy the expansion until right before launch
[4:41:50] procyon_mfc: Preorders for D4 may happend in Dec
[4:41:53] MysticalOS: by 24 hours you mean the 1-2 hours a night they are allowed before CCP says they reached gaming limit for the day
[4:41:57] NVbrutal: diablo is next summer prolly may or june if i had to guess.
[4:42:00] newkingcody: wow players will always find something to whine about
[4:42:13] Yagr6: ^
[4:42:16] trivotix: D4 will take me away from wow for a bit. Nothing about wow but D4 is much anticipated.
[4:42:19] DubakuMatumbo: When its ready they release. EZ and donerino ! I understand that WoW for some is ''work'' and income. But for me it is free time. And I got alot of free time in December
[4:42:21] Exxcar: @THEBUSHTHUG No one is whining? We are having a discussion
[4:42:25] spookychefkarolina: From a company standpoint though - they want to catch consumers when they’re in that “wants to buy everything” stage during December. By the time January rolls around, consumerism dies down.
[4:42:27] im_capy: wrath is also a waiting room for a lot of people wanting Dragonflight
[4:42:30] kokochris: @NVbrutal agree, May is my guess
[4:42:42] grumpnamedjosh: as much as it sucks in the end we all know blizz will launch it when it has the best chance to make the most money to shareholders and quarterly profits.
[4:42:43] remixonfire91: if they have the expac ready by november i dont mind nov launch
[4:42:47] lithium364: but but ion said theyre soo far ahead in development
[4:42:53] lithium364: BabyRage
[4:42:54] MrGrimms: ooo did you get a 304 agis??
[4:43:03] trivotix: Grim rail is good this week
[4:43:20] im_capy: No new raid season 4, they are looking to release DF this year no question. All effort is going towards it
[4:43:33] trivotix: @im_capy I agree
[4:44:23] RiskyChristian: which wow song is this?
[4:44:37] DiiscoViking: grim was rough last week
[4:45:08] joeyshades101: Leakgate!
[4:45:27] EKS90_: I still the spear on last boss in grim is kinda hard to see, but its better atleast.
[4:45:31] EKS90_: i still think*
[4:45:55] DeanoTV: LUL
[4:46:30] Exxcar: yup
[4:46:32] MysticalOS: i mean they could launch in december to avoid refunds, just be last week of december and the raid open after new years, simple
[4:46:36] Exxcar: Refunds are huge
[4:47:06] im_capy: I wish we could buy the collectors box and 100% know we would get the game code by release/prepatch
[4:47:34] NVbrutal: yea feel like since they already said its coming out this year they kinda have to meet those dates now.
[4:47:36] kaihole: 2 current fight dps details? :P
[4:47:44] NVbrutal: or most people will just refund and get it when it actually releases
[4:47:47] EKS90_: @im_capy i could with shadowlands cause the 3dparty retailers sent it out a week early here in sweden, but since to 3dparty retailers this time, im a lot more scared of not getting my box on time.
[4:48:06] EKS90_: @im_capy no 3dparty retailers*
[4:48:08] MysticalOS: I'd launch last week of december, and do a 2 week wait for raids openiing instead of 1, it's not unprecedented
[4:48:18] falldrgn: @NVbrutal  They don't have to. They can push it back if they need to. They only need a release "date" so they can do pre orders
[4:48:24] im_capy: @Commander_Eggi yup, im like 45 mins from Blizz HQ too and im like.....not this year LUL
[4:48:41] Exxcar: @im_capy Could always just pre-purchase digital as well, then when you apply the code from your collector's you'll get refunded the digital in Blizzard bucks
[4:48:53] Zip13: 12 week season 4 made sense
[4:49:04] Yagr6: im just happy football season is upon us
[4:49:12] EKS90_: @im_capy I would if i could, but I don't have that kind of money to invest twice.
[4:49:23] Exxcar: @im_capy That's fair
[4:49:38] im_capy: @Exxcar ya thats what I was thinking of doing.
[4:49:44] EKS90_: @im_capy yeah im in EU so the shippin was atrocious but i have all the boxes... i dont wanna miss this one xD
[4:49:45] Zip13: All 12 m+ affix combos and 4 fated raid cycles
[4:49:57] RocketMan23: he doesnt get affected by fort/tyran
[4:50:29] Exxcar: @Zip13 The cylce will go away at some point and all 3 will be fated at the same time
[4:50:39] CritcobainTV: I'm waiting right here until the next dungeon 😡
[4:51:02] theDirtyon3: the fuck KEKW
[4:51:03] ArcaneMaki: So what is this actual release date "rumor"? What are the dates?
[4:51:17] Exxcar: @SollowJP WowHead has an article for it!
[4:51:17] CritcobainTV: @SollowJP well, you see
[4:51:56] ArcaneMaki: Alright I'll check it out on wowhead. Thanks @Exxcar
[4:51:56] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[4:51:58] Ironcladd: so what is gonna happen on alpha this week? :D
[4:52:05] EKS90_: @Exxcar yeah with EU shippings, no 3dparty retailers this time and the box price collector up to 140 euro, its really no way to doubledip for me. ^^ I'll just have to pray i get it on time since i took express shipping LUL
[4:52:32] Exxcar: @Commander_Eggi Unfortunately with Shipping how it is these days....
[4:52:37] Exxcar: That's a big risk
[4:53:03] Masqerader: it does fall off after 20 seconds so that's always nice
[4:53:04] im_capy: ^
[4:53:04] Zip13: @exxcar and given that we possibly have 5 weeks of prepatch, with the uldaman event being 2 weeks long as stated by blizz. We can have 3 weeks of forced fated then. Cause the shrouded affix also isn’t going away during prepatch
[4:53:08] NVbrutal: bolstering usually isnt really a issue on tyran weeks
[4:53:08] CritcobainTV: !adv

[4:53:10] EKS90_: @Exxcar There was no way around it so, since i have all the collectors, im not about to miss out on this one, even have both d3 and all 3 SC2.
[4:53:16] im_capy: ya, shipping gets 1000000% worse too around the holidays
[4:53:29] Mecabeast: camera angle boss
[4:53:42] Yagr6: yes he can tremor it and dispell it
[4:53:54] Exxcar: @Zip13 Have they confirmed that fated will continue all the way till DF? Doesn't all seasonal content end with the pre-patch usually?
[4:54:05] xdog60: #leakgate
[4:54:26] Exxcar: @Exxcar oh no I'm not saying ytou shouldn't get it, I also have it on order :P
[4:54:33] raldrik: Evokers will do good in here
[4:54:38] EKS90_: @Exxcar Btw, do you know if let's say i just get the standard version on bnet, and then put in my collectors code, that still works right? I dont have to buy epic version to replace with the collectors key?
[4:54:54] kaihole: Spires of Ascension first boss... The trees are SO annoying
[4:55:36] joeyshades101: #leakgate!

[4:55:56] falldrgn: good lord.. is it survival really that OP?
[4:55:59] Onearmyof2: this week is easy asf
[4:56:09] Zip13: @exxcar we’ve had awakened affix active in sl prepatch. I no doubt think that glad/ksm will go away (although bfa s4 ksm was said to be gone for sl prepatch but was available until like 1-2 weeks before sl launch). It’s up in the air.
[4:56:33] Exxcar: @Zip13 Hmmm that's true. Guess we will have to see!
[4:56:37] kaihole: I can't imagine shade of medivh or Moroes with explosive.. Haven't tried it yet
[4:56:41] EKS90_: @Commander_Eggi Fucking perfect, so if i dont have it like 2 days before release imma set aside money in 2 months to just get base then LUL
[4:56:55] im_capy: LUL
[4:56:59] Exxcar: @Commander_Eggi Yup! That way you can still play launch!
[4:57:25] EKS90_: @Commander_Eggi I don't work so that is kinda my issue, so saving is kinda hard ^^

[4:58:56] Agronair: is what i mean
[4:59:02] Masqerader: "We really appreciate this discussion and feedback.  When the time comes for us to announce a release date for Dragonflight, we’ll share details on our initial raid/season schedule.  Thank you!"
[4:59:04] Malarick: I send the wife to Costco with cash.  keeps her from spending too much

[5:00:15] SilkeySmooth: CATERING TO THE 1%
[5:00:19] newkingcody: i hope the raiding starts december 25
[5:00:39] Korupcija_: idk, I'd assume people want it to be released on holiday since you don't work
[5:00:40] zgag: Why was this not brought up by anyone outside of Blizzard until now. Everyone saw the release by the end of the year mention.  What's the issue at this point
[5:00:53] Exxcar: @Towelliee that's bit them in the past though, cause then if they DON'T meet that intent for whatever reason
[5:00:57] Bklyn531: I love that they added a visual for the lightning drop on this boss
[5:00:59] nihilistic_bat: releasing in dec would be fine, and just push the raid start until the new year
[5:01:01] ContraRob: didn't shadowlands launch at like the exact same time?
[5:01:03] Shattermare: Are you smart?
[5:01:12] nihilistic_bat: imagine having family
[5:01:20] Yagr6: thats also not blizzards problem to worry about if people gonna be home
[5:01:24] Zip13: @contrarob yes pretty close to this hypothetical situation
[5:01:24] Exxcar: @zgag We know release is supposed to be this year, but we've heard nothing official on the raid/content schedule yet
[5:01:28] Funderik: there's nothing saying the leak is even true.
[5:01:30] CritcobainTV: what's your favorite ADV flavor so far? @Towelliee
[5:01:32] PvtHudson093: or just dont want to play wow and want to enjoy family time

[5:01:57] zgag: Everyone saw that Blizzard has a release date of prior to the end of the year.  They also know there has to be testing done ect.  Why are we now making it seem like it is a thing
[5:02:01] kaihole: Wow that makes the fight so much easier
[5:02:06] Exxcar: OMG This boss is SO Much better now
[5:02:06] Zip13: The only thing in favor of the leak is the august 30 date for wrath prepatch, image dropped before blizz announcement.
[5:02:10] nihilistic_bat: yes, that change makes it a lot better
[5:02:19] Biggamermike: Biggamermike subscribed with Prime. 
[5:02:33] Ithylz: Our guild usually take a 2-week break for Christmas. Having a new raid pop at this time doesn't feel good because we'd like to play

[6:33:41] Omochrome: make monk
[6:33:44] trickywalrus__: Guessing it's basically just Legion Invasions
[6:33:57] IianaDRK: hopefully going away from the shadowlands style of worldquests with less quests but taking 5 years longer
[6:34:19] strike879: are there warden style kill elite WQ?
[6:34:24] findobin: Do you need active sub to be eligible for alpha?
[6:34:35] abracka_: watch em just remove it lol
[6:34:38] Xailen: New Ui update is nice, but still not near ElvUI good
[6:34:46] IianaDRK: they did move some prot stuff around
[6:35:02] Armdel: rip

[6:36:14] Jarlan23: theyre having a build that has lower apm
[6:36:39] Funderik: they better not change my fury, i play it because it breaks my wrists after raid
[6:36:40] TheCliffyShow: They added Nokhud Offensive. Time for more centaurs.
[6:36:41] Jarlan23: kinda crazy because i had to give up fury because of carpel tunnel
[6:36:44] KerplunkGaming: how possible do you think a delay in launch could happen? like for sure this year? gigahype
[6:37:09] DesiHeat: good morning tow fuegoTea
[6:37:19] IianaDRK: df seems more feature complete considering its alpha at this point
[6:37:20] procyon_mfc: Blizzard has released new Dragonflight Alpha development notes for this week's build, including level 70 content and the four major in-game factions, as well as Monk talent trees and several updates for Warriors, Evokers, Hunters, and Paladins! https://www.wowhead.com/news/august-17th-dragonflight-alpha-development-notes-level-70-and-monk-talent-tree-328387

[6:45:24] Cilir: I can't wait for this expan to come out all the Ui stuff is just getting me giddy
[6:45:32] Kinghorn: LUL
[6:45:36] Kinghorn: stagger is a node
[6:45:44] Vile_: Because Blizz thinks you can't give it baselines for some dumb reason lmao
[6:45:48] Kinghorn: DH gonna have a double jump node for sure
[6:45:48] SoulToned: what a choice
[6:45:49] the_general01: wasted point lol
[6:46:00] Vile_: "Ah yes, meaningful choice." popesChatting
[6:46:04] BJofBorg: That's lazy design
[6:46:07] Rakghoul: how is the Main City ??
[6:46:09] IianaDRK: blizz did say talents are also the system that awards new abilities while leveling as well. so it makes sense
[6:46:20] IianaDRK: not like trees are designed solely around max level
[6:46:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: It does seem weak, to include basic things for a spec in the trees
[6:46:52] Vile_: @IianaDRK It doesn't, because they can give necessary-kit things baseline and make better/more interesting talents.
[6:47:00] Vile_: "You get it as you level" doesn't make it okay.
[6:47:04] Vile_: It's lazy and unimaginative.
[6:47:37] IianaDRK: @IianaDRK or they can put them as choices in the talent tree. it makes no difference. u get less talents cos they make stuff baseline, or u get it as a talent. thats how theyve done it
[6:47:58] Vile_: It makes a huge difference, dude. If you remove it as a talent and give it baseline, they can make BETTER talents.
[6:48:00] Psyhqo: Did anyone get invite tonight yet? Should i just give up on waiting or are invites still ongoing?
[6:48:08] Vile_: Like, imagine being a BrM without Stagger? Makes no sense. So just make it baseline.
[6:48:17] MysticalOS: i mean prot warrior, literally everything is a talent, thunderclap, shield slam, devastate
[6:48:19] Vile_: And in its place, put a cool talent.
[6:48:22] eFoKuZ: monk talents POGGERS
[6:48:22] Daarksyde: prob aoe side?
[6:48:25] IianaDRK: nobody complained for 11 years when the old talent trees had mandatory talents. its no different now
[6:48:26] JukasZor: Got it, blizz thinks BrM has been too good
[6:48:30] f1emitcher: its like a level 28 spell i think
[6:48:31] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: monk life is the best, just sipping brews and tea,
[6:48:44] IianaDRK: if u want choices with baseline on every node then maybe u want the mop style talents back
[6:48:51] Vile_: @IianaDRK What are you talking about? That was the ENTIRE problem with them. Things were STILL mandatory.
[6:48:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spending points so that you aren't pruned just feels bad
[6:49:17] Amarlian: @Psyhqo It's only noon at blizzard, if they are sending invites, these thing take time.
[6:49:20] Tirony: 10% most likely
[6:49:27] IianaDRK: @IianaDRK almost as if it comes down to opinion
[6:49:33] kaido_33: Wow wtf our Dh Meta got nerf in dragonflight. From 25 to 20
[6:49:33] DeanoTV: wut
[6:49:42] the_general01: thats pretty good
[6:49:44] Psyhqo: @Amarlian Thanks for taking time to anwser :)
[6:49:45] kaido_33: Fu blizzard
[6:49:45] Pwncakee: keg + fire combo always
[6:49:46] raldrik: fire smash fire open
[6:49:48] Animemron: im pretty sure that used to be a legion leggo
[6:49:49] Tirony: big aoe
[6:49:59] Vile_: Spending talents on things that are REQUIRED to make your class/spec work makes no sense. That's not opinion, that's a fact. Because they HAVE to be picked, the "option" to talent into them is pointless.
[6:50:20] the_general01: @Vile_ like interrupts.
[6:50:20] Vile_: Again, imagine a BrM without Stagger or a Protection Warrior without Defensive Stance. It just doesn't work.
[6:50:23] ElDrakenMan: Holy pandas batman
[6:50:31] Vile_: Yes, exactly. Interrupts, especially.
[6:50:44] temp3st98: sal'salabim was the chest legendary
[6:50:53] Tirony: just tank being a tank
[6:51:03] Atem___: You'll have to speak up I'm wearing a towel
[6:51:07] Vile_: Make those "choices" baseline and turn the talent spots they WOULD have occupied into something better/new/intuitive.
[6:51:09] Animemron: that was my first legion leggo :D
[6:51:24] IianaDRK: @Vile_ they already explained the reason why theyre doing mandatory talents near the top of trees. not gonna argue with u here about it
[6:51:45] henry_sam: That was in Mists
[6:51:49] henry_sam: Was sick
[6:51:53] Vile_: @Vile_ I don't care about their reasoning, I'm saying their reasoning is bad. lmao
[6:52:23] the_general01: @Vile_ Vile still isnt wrong, regardless of their reasoning lol
[6:52:38] Vile_: "You get it as you level," yes -- you should get it baseline as you level. The talents should be cool shit, interesting shit, and an actual choice. Not stuff that MAKES YOUR CLASS/SPEC WORK at a base level.

[6:52:45] Calls1gn: you can have both brew talents, op
[6:52:55] Onearmyof2: @Vile_ would you rather just less points/talents in a tree then?
[6:52:56] Vile_: Again, imagine a BrM without Stagger or a Prot Warrior without Defensive Stance.
[6:53:13] Vile_: @Onearmyof2 ... I would rather them, as I've been saying, to make better/cooler talents to occupy those spots.
[6:53:48] henry_sam: Oh sweet you can see Renown rewards via Character reputations tab
[6:53:55] PokerFaceMoose: if they don't take stagger then they don't take anything else in the tree. so it's not a even under the guise of being a choice in this case
[6:54:06] Vile_: Talenting into something shouldn't replace getting things that make your class/spec function as a baseline.
[6:54:13] Vile_: Make the choice interesting, make it "meaningful" to fit the meme.
[6:54:23] Onearmyof2: @Vile_ but then we get back to MISTs issue where you have 45 buttons to play your class.
[6:54:28] Vile_: @PokerFaceMoose This. Why even make it a talent in this case? Just to occupy space because of lazy development.
[6:54:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Stagger is just wasting a point, it's unnecessary to make people spend on it
[6:54:38] Amarlian: I am not fully disagreeing with you because i find some of the talents feel very baseline, but to you think that people really expected Blizzard to come up with some 20+ brand new skills/talents per spec when before we just had 12? @Vile_
[6:54:38] Kaydwen: This alpha build is pog

[6:54:57] Contendedlemon: special delivery
[6:55:01] Keyastaron_: POG
[6:55:02] Tirony: blow torch of a brewmaster
[6:55:11] DubakuMatumbo: 2x KEKW
[6:55:24] Vile_: @Amarlian You're assuming I mean active abilities. I'm talking about INTERACTIONS and EFFECTS. Not actual buttons you press, ones that make the buttons you ALREADY HAVE baseline better/more fun/more interesting/function differently.
[6:55:27] Onearmyof2: @Vile_ fair enough, that's kind of boring imo though
[6:55:28] Keyastaron_: go for that w massive brew breath
[6:55:57] swiftjin: damm they are all goof
[6:56:03] Vile_: @Onearmyof2 Ah yes, changing the entirety of how an ability works -- and giving you a choice between taking hte baseline ability and its alter form -- is boring. You get a CHOICE.
[6:56:08] Amarlian: @Amarlian so modifications of abilities for some? Totally not calling you out just having a conversation
[6:56:12] raldrik: RIP lux and WA creators with those interactions
[6:56:16] Vile_: Yes, exactly.
[6:56:29] ElDrakenMan: @towelliee you wanted choices to matter right Kappa
[6:56:55] SoulToned: ya
[6:57:01] lithium364: im glad theyre pushing range mistweaver
[6:57:09] Dashuria: anima Pog
[6:57:09] Vile_: Like, imagine if Shamans had a talent that allowed you to alter your Fire Elemental Totem, yeah? You'd then have a talent that would either grant you Primal Elementalist or an effect that gives you the powers of your Fire Elemental -- completely separate OR one that functions with even Ascendance.
[6:57:14] Nokterian: yeah
[6:57:16] Nokterian: all of it
[6:57:21] maxkule: hows the new login screen look?
[6:57:30] Kinghorn: just level up quick
[6:57:31] Nokterian: effusive is from makinos
[6:57:48] Vile_: Let's say Paladins could alter their Consecration with a talent -- one that makes it either deal increased damage or improve your DR further? Or one that makes it do AoE healing vs. one that makes it do more self-healing?
[6:57:50] Kinghorn: oh this is max?
[6:57:52] Vile_: THAT is interesting.
[6:57:52] Kinghorn: shit
[6:57:52] Barkybamboo: @maxkule alot more detailed than the others
[6:57:53] Nazz_1138: looks like you have to choose the fire dps or mitigation @Towelliee
[6:57:55] Technogre: level
[6:57:57] SoulToned: hope they rename at least some of the covenant abilities in the talent trees to not clearly be from shadowlands
[6:58:16] maxkule: @Barkybamboo Nice. Hopefully someone puts it on youtube soon.
[6:58:19] ElDrakenMan: We want them all LUL
[6:58:20] Ustakkad: big damage
[6:58:22] Alaquane: damage?
[6:58:27] Kinghorn: take the point out of stagger you dont need it
[6:58:28] Ustakkad: always damage
[6:58:33] Kinghorn: guzuSmug
[6:58:34] swiftjin: do convenant stays in dragonflight
[6:58:37] Nazz_1138: @Towelliee oh yeah i meant to get emitter
[6:58:41] Vile_: Anyway, I've done my shouting-into-the-void for the day. KEKW
[6:58:48] Tirony: yeah leave healing to healer, GO BIG DICK ONLY
[6:58:50] Nazz_1138: lol it does
[6:58:52] Thoreya: yo watch DH be insane
[6:58:55] Thoreya: after seeing monk
[6:59:08] fushisaky: can you show us ww talents :D?
[6:59:10] Onearmyof2: @Vile_ I get what you are saying. That would be cool but that would be way too much tuning.  They already struggle with the talents we have now
[6:59:21] BravocadoBrad: why put core mechanics and spells in a talent tree?
[6:59:22] Ustakkad: DH is gonna have a 2 point node for glide, watch
[6:59:30] Vile_: @Onearmyof2 Yes, and the fact that they struggle when they've been at this for so long is SUPER disheartening.
[6:59:31] Vitalsigns64: Kind of excited to see WW tree when it's up on wowhead
[6:59:39] Dashuria: roll is a talent LUL
[6:59:45] Kinghorn: that is fucking dumb
[6:59:46] NILLme: @Ustakkad i wouldnt be surprised if glide is a talent :D
[6:59:53] Kinghorn: pardon my french
[6:59:55] ashwing_: bro double jump will be a talent for DH for sure LUL
[7:00:00] Dashuria: who needs roll and stagger, skip em LUL
[7:00:01] Snabido: More important question: where is interrupt located 😏
[7:00:06] Kinghorn: 100% ashwing_

[7:00:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vivify being instant cast is nice
[7:00:52] BravocadoBrad: why put core spells and mechanics as talents?
[7:00:52] Skaboy_TV: Yeah, we got a brewmaster! Wut, you didn't spec Taunt?!
[7:00:56] Alaquane: interrupt
[7:00:59] Dashuria: some of the talents are so dumb..

[7:01:17] Nokterian: burst
[7:01:22] selendees: so many passive fillers

[7:02:26] Technonono: Looks great wish I could play 😂

[7:03:07] brandroach2: goddamn adds

[7:27:04] mydogisrambo: click it
[7:27:14] Dagomarus: You use trancendemce then that ability turns into transfer

[7:27:36] abruptdecayO_O: yeah its two buttons on retail
[7:27:38] 91Niki: Man y'all are drunk. He is missing a spell lol
[7:27:40] all_beef_franks: the same button wouldnt make sense though, cause what if you wanted to move it before you used it
[7:27:41] Ghostopheles: transcendance and transfer are not the same button, transfer is just missing :(
[7:27:42] all_beef_franks: it just bugged
[7:27:43] UltraKSlaya: it is supposed to be two buttons
[7:27:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dude, where's your button?
[7:27:54] Templexx: yea the other one is red colored
[7:27:54] 91Niki: "JUST CLICK IT TOWELLIEE sacTIMMY "
[7:27:56] mydogisrambo: fn reported
[7:27:58] yib_: that seems bugged aswell then
[7:28:06] Zilberg: If you just click it 4Head
[7:28:06] Coffenatic: I was thinking they may have combined the abilities to the same button
[7:28:19] Templexx: ^^
[7:28:27] pikacho000: weither
[7:28:33] Molvonos: towSweat towSweat

[7:28:43] SoulToned: @Towelliee ya maybe theyre working on combining the buttons

[7:28:50] flebbooo: mw has some juicy stuff Pog
[7:28:51] Dagomarus: Yeah its a gate keeping talent sadly

[7:29:02] UltraKSlaya: monk FTW
[7:29:02] Molvonos: @mackieeswe Your face is the same button!
[7:29:10] Dagomarus: The fire breath stuff seems very fun
[7:29:10] ohnot___her: We can get WoO and BDB!?
[7:29:21] abruptdecayO_O: why would they combine the buttons. its common to re-place the port before ever usingit
[7:29:21] Zilberg: D: Woah @molvonos
[7:29:31] 91Niki: @mackieeswe No you sacGUN
[7:29:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: 60-70 won't take too long, they said it will take a little longer than Shadowlands did, but that was pretty quick
[7:30:03] Pesky_Ninja: @wEiRdO_dUdE SL was like 12-15 hrs if I recall correctly
[7:30:11] Thoreya: wqs are back. MrGM tweeted about it
[7:30:15] Amarlian: @wEiRdO_dUdE We easily hit max level before finishing all the story quests
[7:30:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it took me like 15 hours to hit level cap in Shadowlands, so approximately that
[7:30:41] Nokterian: @Towelliee the new dungeon is dragonriding watching ymuytv
[7:30:47] Dagomarus: Its probably because its in the talent tree the tranfer ability probably hasnt been linked to the talent along with the base ability
[7:30:49] DPeachGaming: @KeleStraza oh crap, thx for the gift <3
[7:30:50] Nokterian: yumytv*
[7:31:16] Spince_: wait a minute did they add monk talents

[7:39:46] Dagomarus: So far the route for dragonriding is pretty clear
[7:40:06] iamWaritself: So monk and bear, in alpha, feel pretty complete??

[7:43:18] plankdemi: till those balls give lightning resist like that ff14 fight
[7:43:22] DeleldurTV: So how are the monk trees? ive been raiding for the past 3 hours so had the stream muted

[7:43:51] Cooboomy: love the dragon flying aspect of it. very neat
[7:44:06] Snabido: What, is it like a sandbox dungeon or something
[7:44:09] temp3st98: one of the biggest dungeon?
[7:44:19] Zilberg: I like it.. its different
[7:44:21] Dagomarus: You could go boss to boss and go back for % i guess
[7:44:27] MercurialPTDR: seems lame
[7:44:28] Buckwink: man Monk looks so good wtf
[7:44:38] CapDan: a lot of the bosses are "locked" behind trash
[7:44:49] strike879: i think they should make the trash in there be enough for 200% so routes are easy to make
[7:44:50] Zilberg: Until a pug member fucks up and loses their flying and we all have to wait 45 minutes KEKW
[7:44:51] Kneckt: https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1559997248401965061 does this mean halls of infusion is out too?
[7:44:54] Thoreya: @MercurialPTDR always one person LUL

[7:46:34] Pansarpatrik: Leakgate!
[7:46:34] Dagomarus: Yeah the fact the dragon breath cleaves and hits 2 more times per inital new target seems broken
[7:47:09] Buckwink: what are these guys called again? like their race?
[7:47:13] garmin1987: do they share health or is it separate
[7:47:17] ZacharielPlays: PTSD from shrine of the storm

[7:47:25] ayrisen: You think Blizz might give streamers keys to give away like last time?
[7:47:26] jorgoth: enemy nameplates
[7:47:26] strike879: it would be a nightmare if they made the % too close to total mob count imagen if you need almost all mobs and you miss a pack you would spend like 10 min patroling the dungeon to find them
[7:47:35] Dagomarus: Centaurs @buckwink ?
[7:47:43] Buckwink: @Dagomarus thank you
[7:47:43] Zilberg: 346 Pog

[7:48:54] HexGen: I love this breath reset after keg
[7:49:00] CapDan: @Thoreya i mean... too concerned

[7:49:36] CapDan: @Quecklain rip, they'll never see it coming
[7:49:57] Dagomarus: Sounds like reverse dk, the shield heals instead of the heals causing a shield
[7:50:01] Buckwink: jesus christ

[8:15:33] Zkx_: How are UH DKs looking so far in alpha?
[8:16:23] RmysYolo: No clue
[8:16:26] nezuko2486: If you could get the vivify torghast power out there, would be awesome! lol
[8:16:30] Dagomarus: Maybe the event is the storm thats causing the powers to drop?
[8:16:31] Kitune_Silverblade: look up?
[8:16:31] d1stract10n: underground?
[8:16:34] strike879: @towelliee are there warden style WQ of kill rare and done?
[8:16:36] maventar: what are the quests?
[8:16:43] Texas_Mizfit: go in room

[8:17:20] BeeboBiggins: dat
[8:17:22] josuemaple123: thanks S2
[8:17:24] Dagomarus: Maybe its like the guild wars events where you get rewarded based on contribution
[8:17:42] d1stract10n: unless this event is zone wide
[8:17:44] Onearmyof2: do you get rep/renown from these?
[8:17:45] 91Niki: That sounds a lot more likely than it being an every wq thing
[8:17:49] Funderik: like a mini deathwing event from cata kinda thing?
[8:17:58] Maxoru0: that's interesting, torghast in open world lol
[8:18:07] almostdps: wtf
[8:18:08] Funderik: loooooooool
[8:18:11] Drizz_36: anima power? D:
[8:18:30] Dagomarus: Emotional bombardment
[8:18:35] almostdps: i see the sheep model right before they hit
[8:18:39] Funderik: there's the aspect powers everyone was worried about, looks like blizzard on troll mode
[8:18:48] Wcvechten: Your stagger probably triggers it lmao @Towelliee
[8:18:53] MrBoomToasted: I'm glad that their not just forgetting about Torgast stuff, and implementing it another way.
[8:19:08] Nakama08: what do you think about monk trees?
[8:19:18] Onearmyof2: @Towelliee do these quest have rep/renown?
[8:20:17] DeanoTV: mrgm twitter has the renown pics
[8:20:21] Funderik: world buff farming is back kekw
[8:20:24] Drizz_36: time skip? LUL
[8:20:25] Dagomarus: Did u get rewards for that event?
[8:20:26] gairefear: So there is only one unrevealed talent tree now? Demon hunter?
[8:20:45] Onearmyof2: wonder if there are different events for the different reps?
[8:20:57] Ghostopheles: world peace?
[8:20:58] brian_777777777: rep but they added 76 ranks
[8:21:04] Jamalamadingdong: is there something to hand in?
[8:21:15] Barkybamboo: are the skulls on the map rares or world bosses?
[8:21:24] BeeboBiggins: i can see clearly now the shit is gone
[8:21:26] Drizz_36: so "Reputation" is basically anima? seems that way
[8:21:31] thagalvir: maybe they spawned at the same time because server reset
[8:21:42] DeanoTV: no rep is renown
[8:21:46] DeanoTV: renown is account wide
[8:21:51] Dagomarus: That wasn’t a event that was just abit of spotty draconic weather Kappa
[8:21:57] Funderik: rep is renown not anima
[8:22:03] Drizz_36: oh okay
[8:22:09] brian_777777777: as long as none of them call me champion
[8:22:12] gairefear: Dragon anima
[8:22:14] strike879: is the renown capped per week with catch up or can you just grind away
[8:22:18] almostdps: ooh gear from the events
[8:22:18] MrBoomToasted: PogChamp

[8:23:24] DeanoTV: damnnn
[8:23:24] bowsers1: look so good lol

[8:23:30] thagalvir: frost dk want
[8:23:34] brian_777777777: if those arent copies of the dungeon skins ill be happy
[8:23:35] nezuko2486: that looks sick!

[8:23:54] Yagr6: is this pre patch gear?
[8:24:03] Dagomarus: Nice staff
[8:24:05] Funderik: yh
[8:24:13] WhiteDeathUK: @Towelliee looks like the quest is just a drop chance from the mobs so you don't have to stick around for it to finish
[8:24:23] gritbarontv: it's like the underwater zone where you turn in gems
[8:24:25] thagalvir: maybe it is a weekly you get one from each zones event
[8:24:27] zzorbas: 395 gear is equivalent to what difficulty from the raid?
[8:24:29] Funderik: 395 is big
[8:24:33] Eggz1004: raid gear
[8:24:36] Eggz1004: ?
[8:24:36] 91Niki: 252? LOL that's laughable
[8:24:57] Eggz1004: or maybe pre-raid gear
[8:25:05] Dagomarus: 252? Thats like zerith mortis max cypher gear
[8:25:06] almostdps: 252 is probably fine for leveling in df gear
[8:25:13] zzorbas: What ilvl is raid gear?
[8:25:13] gritbarontv: probably before normal raid
[8:25:19] The_Kayson: tabbed (beautiful person detected)
[8:25:22] sorrel_n: Revamped professions plus this world content and... I may not have to care about raiding in WoW. Amazing.
[8:25:26] gritbarontv: entry level
[8:25:36] Daarksyde: Fungeon?
[8:25:37] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[8:25:37] ayrisen: the fungeon
[8:25:44] Calls1gn: Mythic+ dragonriding
[8:25:51] Sam_ee_: i have that bug @Towelliee
[8:25:54] Sam_ee_: or daily idk
[8:25:57] Arbszy: I have done much yet
[8:25:59] Arbszy: habnt*
[8:26:04] ArcaneMaki: Looking at the map like that it looks so small
[8:26:06] UntraceableBG: Rip dh
[8:26:13] Onearmyof2: Seems kind of like the Tormentors of Torghast in the maw
[8:26:25] Ghostopheles: i haven't done any and i can't see any
[8:26:26] Dagomarus: Makes sense to cap it given the gear quality
[8:26:30] Buckwink: holy shit
[8:26:32] ArcaneMaki: Nice!
[8:26:41] Buckwink: 10plus on a dragon or reg mount?
[8:26:54] Kneckt: @Towelliee does dragonriding feel better this build?
[8:27:02] TheUnknowing: normal ground mount @Buckwink
[8:27:02] jeffnsteff2019: we need huge maps with exploration  n discoveries
[8:27:04] Arkangel_I: yea dynamic events will help open world content a lot.
[8:27:07] Eggz1004: @Buckwink ground mount i think is what he meant
[8:27:07] Angsterz: 10+ ? no way
[8:27:11] Drizz_36: wtf
[8:27:37] sorrel_n: So assuming they keep dragonriding for future exps they basically have to make all future zones at least as big as DF ones. Otherwise flying will make them feel way too small
[8:27:48] Yagr6: so there is no power tied to the specific dragon aspects colors?
[8:28:49] Ghostopheles: how did you get those points?
[8:28:50] MrBoomToasted: @Yagr6 Nope, no power tied anywhere :)
[8:29:05] 91Niki: Account wide stuff from day one?! POGGERS
[8:29:09] MrBoomToasted: Noice
[8:29:11] nezuko2486: hell yeah! that's awesome!
[8:29:19] gritbarontv: smart move
[8:29:23] DeanoTV: and renown (rep) will be account wide
[8:29:27] yardmmada: what was the torghast power stuff  I saw?
[8:29:54] Drizz_36: they seem to be temporary buffs you get from doing world quests
[8:29:59] Kneckt: what is dragonfly riding
[8:30:03] Onearmyof2: thats 100 though for all 4
[8:30:04] yardmmada: cool
[8:30:04] temp3st98: yes but it's 100 in total
[8:30:06] Yagr6: until 10.1
[8:30:21] 91Niki: Free food sacBLANKIES
[8:30:29] Strouss: im sure everyone asked fifty times, how is Brewe feeling?
[8:30:39] HeatherJC83: that looks so cool and fun
[8:30:40] Jokervenom1978: I pledge myself to the Tuskar
[8:30:43] ArcaneMaki: God bless not having to pick only one just like the convenant.
[8:30:57] Onearmyof2: @Towelliee you can take all 4 though
[8:31:28] EKS90_: You level all 4 tho, according to the DF announcement and they are account wide
[8:31:44] bllynni6614: It's all cosmetic right?
[8:31:58] Yagr6: is wow slowly headed toward a paid battle pass of some sort
[8:32:01] BreninUK: Will beta come next week or is there a break between alpha and beta?
[8:32:12] yardmmada: SUPER COOOL!
