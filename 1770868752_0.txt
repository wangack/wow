[3:31:03] Procasually: Oh it could be on UE5, lots of things could use it. Use it well tho?
[3:31:11] Kuretake: The low-poly aesthetic of WOW was great problem solving and great distinctive design. The whole industry couldn't manage to repeat that success in 18 years.
[3:31:41] BoricuaSJ: real or unreal? (see comments after watching a bit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqoB7bgbEoY
[3:31:42] Airwaive: I dont trust mmos that showcase graphics right out of the gate. never ends well
[3:31:51] DatGuyAnton: Wow is running on a custom engine right?
[3:31:57] Kuretake: Until they do, I don't think anything will survive  after the hype
[3:31:57] wolftwenty: my message from earlier didn't go through swifty do you know what i said that is wrong?
[3:31:57] odem___: we need swg 2.0 !
[3:32:05] Famous54: no

[3:32:10] bellamii66: Yes
[3:32:12] Procasually: You had me at fresh classic
[3:32:15] vanillasky7788: no iam done with classic fiesta
[3:32:18] Famous54: WoW is tired, been there done that
[3:32:19] Rykor09: Id love just classic +
[3:32:20] krissieswag: Is this SOM Classic?

[3:32:32] BoricuaSJ: real or unreal? (see comments after watching a bit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqoB7bgbEoY
[3:32:33] FILOzor: hahaha goddamn swifty warrior elf again lol
[3:32:45] Kuretake: WOW needs it's own engine and stype. UE5 or UE10 wouldn'T make a difference imo.
[3:32:50] TheEndIsNear777: In 5 years When Chat GPT 8.0 comes out I will code an MMO :p
[3:32:55] wolftwenty: but the question is would they be able to cross it over or would the have to start over
[3:32:56] Kuretake: style*
[3:32:56] back2r00ts: get some xp for 12
[3:33:01] Elwhappo: best thing about wow was the open world travel with few loading screens
[3:33:15] eltonazevedobounty: @Swifty why waste time playing this? :O
[3:33:32] Airwaive: think wow graphics are just fine
[3:33:39] imoxyr6: it's possible to port WOW to Diablo 4 engine tbh
[3:33:41] krissieswag: Can you please explain the wow hardcore, is it a mode in the classic vanilla? Is this a real server or private server? Thanks for the answer 🙏🙏
[3:33:51] eltonazevedobounty: classic is boring, hardcore +++ boring xD

[3:34:53] Shermando007: @Swifty so with hardcore server, if you reach 60 and then die is that it? or if you make it to 60 you're safe?
[3:35:02] zaymaa: wow
[3:35:09] masterleet: LOL
[3:35:21] kiruz__: 10.10 you mean like 10th october?
[3:35:27] usefulidiotgg: wow 2 in ue5
[3:35:30] fbirobertmueller805: It’s crazy hardcore is better then retail lol 😂
[3:35:30] vanillasky7788: THIS IS INSANE
[3:35:34] hedkos: @shermando007 ye
[3:35:38] Elwhappo: wtb unreal wow 2
[3:35:41] imoxyr6: yeah but to optimized it gonna be a nightmare Kappa

[3:35:50] TheEndIsNear777: arcanite reaper AHHH AHHHHH
[3:35:52] TheEndIsNear777: lol
[3:35:53] DatGuyAnton: You think you do, but you don’t
[3:35:53] hedkos: @shermando007 or play no death
[3:35:54] Rando1988: my laptop would catch fire trying to play unreal engine 5 games
[3:36:04] Procasually: Is reaching lvl 60 that dangerous? Couldn't you just spend a ton of time but in safe grinding? Would take forever but you wouldn't be in danger of dying
[3:36:27] imoxyr6: sure but  not MMORPG
[3:36:30] Shermando007: @hedkos wait so what's the answer?
[3:36:36] slaxtothamax: wow prob wont upgrade graphic a lot of people play on potatoes. theyd loose subs.
[3:36:50] imoxyr6: mmo u need to render hundreds of players
[3:36:54] BoricuaSJ: So how would a wow female elf look in unreal engine?
[3:37:05] Kuretake: What WOW needs is a remake. New story adaptation with slower progress-story wise, 10 times bigger zones with 100x more players on the same server, better technology. And that probably can only happen if a new and better company buys the IP.
[3:37:07] Kuretake: One can only hope.

[3:37:33] TheEndIsNear777: Hopefully the microsoft deal goes through so they can take over
[3:37:44] Muukzor: @Kuretake they tried that with project titan... people want wow they dont want new stuff. Thats why every new mmorpg fails.
[3:38:05] Rando1988: we all know blizzard  would quickly release a game then put bandaid on it in patches so the game wouldn't be optimized
[3:38:11] TheEndIsNear777: @Muukzor did project titan ever get released?
[3:38:18] StreamElements: Cheezbites just subscribed for 4 months in a row PogChamp
[3:38:24] Procasually: @Kuretake would love that, but logistically, woof
[3:38:42] Muukzor: @TheEndIsNear777 No it became overwatch eventually because it made no sense for blizzard
[3:38:44] bigbangdeath: hc challenge interesting ....
[3:38:50] Muukzor: why compete with ur own mmorpg :D
[3:38:52] imoxyr6: welp Diablo 4 is close to blizzard new 'mmorpg' tbh
[3:39:00] TheEndIsNear777: @Muukzor well that was a mistake, blizzard isn't playing their own games, we are :p
[3:39:04] letemspin_sorare: hi swifty do you ever play retail anymore ?
[3:39:04] Kuretake: I think it will be possible very soon. Tech is progressing so fast. @Procasually
[3:39:12] BoricuaSJ: You had seen this right? WoW in unreal 5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBK6HPQFE0k
[3:39:14] Xaviwan078: wow cartoon graphic is good just upgrade it
[3:39:21] Muukzor: Swifty I was talking to a chatter not you, we discussed project titan, that'd compete with wow which is bad :D
[3:39:39] BoricuaSJ: here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBK6HPQFE0k
[3:40:06] johnnyde89: I don't like real looking games. It's just never right looking. I think wow looks great with the cartoon style.
[3:40:16] Xaviwan078: wow remake
[3:40:25] usefulidiotgg: grizzly hills was the best one
[3:40:27] imoxyr6: dude it's not the same genre,MMO u need to render hundreds of thousands of players
[3:40:28] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[3:40:33] Xaviwan078: potato mode lol
[3:40:36] neugassh: its terrible LUL
[3:40:43] fbirobertmueller805: I know I know I know
[3:40:44] akkatest: So u will pay a way overpriced game cus u have to use lower graphic...
[3:40:45] Xaviwan078: wow
[3:40:46] fbirobertmueller805: I know I know
[3:40:51] Xaviwan078: nice perfect
[3:40:54] Rando1988: I like those graphics there
[3:40:56] Xaviwan078: love it
[3:41:02] TheEndIsNear777: I want wow in 8k >:)
[3:41:06] TheEndIsNear777: NO, 16k :)
[3:41:08] TheEndIsNear777: lol jk
[3:41:14] Procasually: The graphics were ok, the lighting was terrible
[3:41:16] BoricuaSJ: I want Virtual world WoW...
[3:41:21] Xaviwan078: cartoon graphic with really good graphic
[3:41:23] Rando1988: I'd definitely  play horde tho if the game looked like  that
[3:41:27] Xaviwan078: i love it
[3:41:35] BoricuaSJ: go all Sword online type
[3:41:57] imoxyr6: BDO and NW prolly the most realistic look MMO and those game barely optimized LUL
[3:42:10] BoricuaSJ: Its an anime
[3:42:35] Xaviwan078: why blizzard dont do it
[3:42:37] Thehossboss: Sword art online*
[3:42:43] Xaviwan078: blizzard are lazy sometime
[3:42:44] Procasually: warrior has to be the hardest for this challenge. hunter easiest?
[3:42:45] Jake423: Kill bunnies and rats
[3:42:49] Kuretake: A massive MMO   with true economic system take money from 1 type of player and and reward others. people economically.  It's so difficult to design such thing but if possible, it could be so immersive for the whole playerbase.
[3:43:36] Muukzor: How much is Samsung paying you to wear that shirt Kappa
[3:43:37] Procasually: @Kuretake would require finite resources in game.
[3:43:37] BoricuaSJ: this one is crazy.. ever play Valheim? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glWjFUPtQko
