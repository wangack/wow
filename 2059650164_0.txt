[0:34:06] bonyato: spriest
[0:34:20] Ruthstrom: you should do a /reload after donwloading addon uppdates.

[0:35:51] nerunehru: i think the first boss is too hard, unless we were doing something wrong, but it seems like its hard for every group.
[0:35:59] Twankiez1992: @JokerdTV my hot take is that they should buff it every 2 weeks to keep the difficulty up so it isn't a clean clear every week.
[0:36:03] trmonx: same as bfd they will let sweaty players wipe a little then nerf it so everyone can clear in 30min
