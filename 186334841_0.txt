[4:16:20] DRAGONSLAYERIRL: Modurist Plus, if you start chasing the enemy healer around the map, your own healer will have to expose himself since he won't be able to reach you and heal. So if you're just chasing their healer you will both have a lot less pressure, and the enemy team will have an easier time getting to you and your healer
