[2:38:19] Dkgungo: how many times has there been a "wow killer" that hit that market only to die in 6 months
[2:38:29] timmythegamertv: I'd say they're already part way into development.. but now they're ready to kick things off properly from a hiring perspective, this won't have been off the back of one board meeting to say they want to make an mmo there will be a general idea and theme and some starter work done with it..
[2:38:30] Noobicron: every mmo besides wow has been pretty shit except ESO
[2:38:32] Valestrus: @towelliee who's ryan?
[2:38:38] wak3up07: They have an insane amount of art/story already available from the card game and their universe website

[2:39:16] Aervyper: @wak3up07 but it's a messed up world isn't it?
[2:39:27] Noobicron: star wars galaxies was nice
[2:39:30] bad_fish_too: I don't think any mmo can compete with WoW right now. They come and go.
[2:39:51] Alienfromger: AOC will be differnet 4 sure!
[2:39:53] Grunton: new world was disapointing
[2:39:54] dirtyoldgrandpa024: CarlSmile

[2:40:18] Thunderbrew: What was the twitter post?
[2:40:40] Grunton: aoc looks good but the combat just looks bad imo
[2:40:46] ChrisarN: Wildstar was laggy
[2:41:04] Noobicron: same with crowfall, needs to be smoother
[2:41:05] N3llee: Wildstar burned because they took all the alpha player feedback and flushed it down the toilet
[2:41:13] N3llee: I know I was there
[2:41:20] elchaposkjelbo: wtf is even corrosive miist, just doing torghast on my bm monk wtf

[2:41:38] Grunton: wild star would have made it if they didnt make it so grindy and hardcore
[2:41:46] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee Just Thinking if the Jailer get his way. Will this be the Blizzard reset button for the game just like Marvel and DC has done.
[2:41:59] YellowKiwi: Crowfall is fun but they would never figure how to optimize the engine

[2:43:19] legendarydarkstar: hey towelliee who exactly is the jailer?
[2:43:20] bad_fish_too: Torghast has been rough with the new tank changes
[2:43:29] meady: Anyone know how you get renown once you change covenants ive hit level 6 but i have no quests left.
[2:43:30] N3llee: The bugs in the raid after launch were the same bugs we tested a year earlier
[2:44:08] N3llee: Long nights with Timetraveler was fun though
[2:44:08] Molvonos: @Akrylikz But a plethora of people left EQ for WoW who had years and years of character built up.
[2:44:14] ciranidd: the dailys and weeklys and i think world bosses have a chance to drop catch up renown
[2:44:20] legendarydarkstar: is it not weird that he is gonna free everyone and give everyone freedom even though he is in jail ?

[2:45:33] Aervyper: @Towelliee what did evolutionary get Cyberpunk 2077.... Leave my toaster game of WoW alone
[2:45:48] LoseAlotLuke: a league mmo lead by ghostcrawler, could be huge
[2:45:57] metavahn: so a wow clone
[2:46:24] Grunton: and it its a riot game it has to be simple 5 buttons per classe so league players want to play
[2:46:32] Aervyper: but everyone wanted the elitest crap they got and well yea...
[2:46:54] wak3up07: Wonder if they'll go f2p just like all their other games
[2:47:00] bad_fish_too: Just look at CP2077 Kappa
[2:47:03] Thunderbrew: What is ten cent?
[2:47:03] LoseAlotLuke: Riot are swimming in money
[2:47:05] metavahn: still waiting for pantheon
[2:47:05] pangarma: hello kitty island adventure mmo
[2:47:14] MaterWellon: @Towelliee But these are smart people right, wouldnt they just not make it if they know if its gonna be another shit mmo, somehow they think its gonna be good
[2:47:23] sandduz1: How can you ”reset that jailors eye or can you reset it eith the vendor?
[2:47:25] ambiotic: They did hire away a lot of the artists from wow and now we know why
[2:47:25] Sadisticmedic: 30-40 is about right

[2:55:13] Kaykerrs: Happy Holidays Towel!
[2:55:37] sharie: @TheUnknowing look what ever happens or happend with the workforce is not the topic here i meant the Games itself
[2:55:46] Clicklesly: Wait, what're they nerfing in NW?
[2:55:49] Grunton: ten cent it will have them
[2:56:07] rzoo: Riot spends tens of millions on K/DA to promote skins and the game.. they don't care about losing money at the start
[2:56:12] Nosusee: Maybe if its not pay to win it might be alright
[2:56:15] SpoofAvatar: they might be targeting ASIA for their playerbase
[2:56:17] SyrothTV: @Towelliee wow just tweeted about torghast nerfs
[2:56:19] Mythykk: Thanks for the 2020Takeout @kaykerrs
[2:56:19] heavenscloud1517: I dont see the nerf on MMO-Champion @Towelliee
[2:56:26] drunkermonk: not sure it its an true MMO but i wish path of exile wasnt so buggy
[2:56:27] TheFuriyon: When do you think the Torghast nerfs will take effect?
[2:56:34] A_New_Challenger: How is PSO2 doing? I got pulled away with the end of BFA to get ready for Shadowlands so I stopped, but it seemed like it was off to a good start.
[2:56:54] TheUnknowing: Oh i know what you meant @sharie and I simply made a comment that they have scummy workers, if they dont scumbag their games thats cool. I simply made a comment
[2:56:56] sharie: @TheUnknowing if you would not play games from Studios who treat their devs not great all you ha dleft to play were Single dev indie games
[2:57:06] Grunton: 8 didnt fell like an 8 to me
[2:57:07] A_New_Challenger: that is microtransaction based...I guess not a true MMO though
[2:57:07] TheVigiliance: I think that everyone just expects riot to have microtransactions, but if they do any kind of playerpower they are gonna lose the longevity
[2:57:09] N3llee: thats still to long
[2:57:09] Tigerklaue: the nerfs are great could do 8 with my 150 ilvl alt without problems
[2:57:11] Kneckt: yeh it was easy and fun on spriest
[2:57:12] TheFuriyon: I got 35 powers in my layer 3 run on my alt
[2:57:14] SyrothTV: SOLO!? WTF
[2:57:15] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee i got 12 powers and im on floor 3
[2:57:16] TheFuriyon: Never seen that before
[2:57:17] N3llee: in my opinion
[2:57:21] hunterxp: It needed the nerf
[2:57:25] Zeakon92: we did 2 x lvl 7 withing 40min
[2:57:29] heavenscloud1517: @A_New_Challenger it is doing great especially since all the Windows bugs have been fixed. its really fun and brings me back to my PSO gamecube days
[2:57:30] itsArlong: I hope it doesnt feel watered down or too easy, finding the balance will be hard imo
[2:57:36] Kromede: World of Legends POGGERS
[2:57:46] TheUnknowing: @sharie and I never said I wouldnt play a game from their studio, it was just a silly comment that you seem to take personally which i dont understand but thats fine
[2:57:47] Tigerklaue: you can now ignore most powers and skip to the boss
[2:57:48] MrGattz: IM FINALLY HOME

[3:07:28] SpoofAvatar: they didn't need to make the raid more difficult, just reduce the amount of gear
[3:07:37] xideontv: long expansions don't drive revenue up, won't ever happen

[3:09:17] Xsizematter: oh can someone link that aura
[3:09:25] Grunton: dont think it counts the special abilities
[3:09:31] Molvonos: Nightfae can cheese anything because of the melee troop's ability
[3:09:32] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: It's a 24hr mission, so keep in mind
[3:09:38] dalaraz: aura is nt right cause it doesnt count he special abilities of adventures
[3:09:48] Crystalyzee: for soul ash ones as nf i just do 5 trappers and dreamweaver as my last choice works everytime so far
[3:11:09] ambiotic: RIP
[3:11:14] sharie: monkaS

[4:31:07] TheUnknowing: @Avinar i like android ive just always had some crazy issues with android phones for some reason and never issues with iphones so ive just stuck with iphone myself
[4:31:27] nerdgurl22: The SIM should work regardless of Droid to Apple, unless the Droid was older. However she should be able to pop the SIM out and put it into the new Pro. She made need to call Verizon to have them switch the IMEI on her Line, so it reflexs the correct equipment.

[4:31:53] andycoin99: I’ve always been a android until last year I got the iPhone xr and I will never go back to android
[4:32:23] TheUnknowing: @Avinar that could have been my issue, i had some pretty crummy brand phones at some points so, who knows.
[4:32:52] Avinar: I have a manga reader app as well as emulated games thats a lot more annoying to do on iphone, which is some of the main reasons I don't swap back to iphone lol

[5:31:13] Jinjo219: i feel blizz doesn't want the community to gear up so fast. getting gear that upgrades your character is the best part of the game, the excitement!!
[5:31:39] YellowKiwi: @towelliee what do you think of each boss a token and trade 4 tokens for a random loot
[5:32:05] wellborn: There will be a drop in overall attendance in a couple of months.

[5:32:55] JonnyScotland: have*
[5:33:03] wellborn: @Molvonos yep
[5:33:17] Molvonos: This new loot philosophy has made people more picky (in pugs) and people are dropping and breaking keys if theres even a chance of not two chesting.

[5:34:46] yeaahyeah: People leaving groups is healthy for the pug M+ scene

[5:35:29] Dcarter: im loyal
[5:35:38] Thaiestro: lol
[5:36:06] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: It's not just the loot from m+/raids. Look at the callings. I can do an epic calling and *maybe* get a 171 conduit for a spec I'll never play. And because certain streamers complained about WF/TF items from WQs and LFR etc. There's no reason for me to do WQs with gear, because it'll never be useful to me. Then there's the "you can't trade this item because it's an ilvl" upgrade, so when people get gear, they don't want it sometimes and can't trade it. The rewards just feel underwhelming tbh.
[5:36:26] JonnyScotland: @Lt_Dan_and_his_magic_legs Exactly
[5:36:37] Retro1989: Vendor trash Pog
[5:36:47] Molvonos: Yeeep. The callings are pretty much bullshit
[5:36:51] TheNodbot: callings are kind of disappointing
[5:37:06] theSalute: I somehow got an epic item I didnt need from my epic calliongs on two toons
[5:37:09] theSalute: feelsweirdman
[5:37:48] michiganbrownie: i was actually shocked when a legendary calling gave me a piece of gear because i hadnt gotten a drop once in the expansion up to that point
[5:37:59] Molvonos: You legit have a better chance of getting epics farming fucking trash out in the world than from M+
[5:38:08] andycoin99: Chiefs play the saint on Sunday that’ll be a good game
[5:39:19] JonnyScotland: The expansion in general is great imo, but it's always two steps forward, one step back, They always do something that most people don't want.

[6:49:55] Luthercorpz: Yah the VAST majority of world players have PS4. It's techniccally not even old gen

[6:53:12] LoseAlotLuke: people on RTX cards are lucky on that game
[6:53:16] LoseAlotLuke: DLSS is actual hacks
[6:53:37] Luthercorpz: CyberPunk is okay. Ive seen the whole game now beginning to end. Without Reeves the game would of been 5/10 instead of 6/10
[6:53:42] EvoCyberNation: rtx isn't amazing :) 2k+ res is what makes it. :)
[6:54:09] LoseAlotLuke: its not the ray tracing which makes RTX amazing its DLSS
[6:54:12] Luthercorpz: Cyberpunk def wasnt some game breaking new style of play or anything at all. The game was made up to be the next gen game of the world LUL
[6:54:30] Luthercorpz: It's a B - rpg at best
[6:54:32] EvoCyberNation: You can mod cyberpunk to make it look close to rtx. I modded cyberpunk with previous mod settings on Metro Exodus
[6:54:58] WeedIsMySin__: How is the story though, does it meet ur expecations? 25 hours in but mostly done sidequest. Not talking about glitches or bugs, purely the writing and story telling @Luthercorpz
