[0:43:50] Linaro: is holy or disc more common for gnomergan?
[0:44:27] Japscat: oi is that nameplate manabar a weakaura?
[0:44:37] prodigy_wow: You can do Disc with PI or Disc with Holy Specialization for 5% holy crit
[0:45:17] prodigy_wow: if your group is strong, go with PI, otherwise the crit is more healing
[0:45:35] khourdrick: I've been trying out 20/11/0 talents with spell warding and Holy Nova seems slightly stronger for own survivability since meta is still bursty.

[0:47:02] KappexD: no one is capping farm?
[0:47:39] Faithdimmer: lol
[0:47:40] khourdrick: it does feel mana heavy it mainly just a choice of having divine spirit or Holy Nova. Can be good for solo killing players as a healer

[1:08:26] Lunaatj: I don't think they reintroduced those mounts.
[1:08:51] Lunaatj: Yeah, cause a lot of people liked the armour on the new epic mounts.
[1:09:21] Lunaatj: I mean, kodos are pretty good.
[1:10:53] Lunaatj: I mean, you don't have to take it there mate.
[1:10:55] Lunaatj: KEKW
[1:11:01] Lunaatj: Just because I like kodos
[1:11:03] Lunaatj: OMEGALUL

[1:12:34] Extramediums: I mean, we have other fruits on pizza that's more common than that and people hate on pineapple. It's not my thing, but same thing, I'll eat it if offered
[1:12:55] Extramediums: tomato
[1:12:59] genjimainofc: KEKW
[1:13:04] genjimainofc: good one
[1:13:04] Lunaatj: hydraT
[1:13:38] genjimainofc: still tomato
[1:13:39] Extramediums: some times, my partner loves it
[1:13:45] frozentolisten: cus raw tomato is vile
[1:13:55] genjimainofc: are u saying sauce makes it less tomato?
[1:14:09] Extramediums: I love just a good proper Margherita pizza
[1:14:14] Danimal_Media: technically a nightshade veg too, which work on pizzas
[1:14:25] Danimal_Media: like peppers
[1:14:50] Extramediums: @frozentolisten I grew up with my naan making canned tomato all the time, so I would have raw tomato with pickling salt or just regular salt, and it's wonderful
[1:15:25] Ananasbaum: Why did they change it, that you cant use ClassicAuraDurations anymore :(?
[1:15:54] Ananasbaum: It's since the update, blizzard fixxed the loophole according to the owner of the addon
[1:16:35] Ananasbaum: Yeah, idk what's in their mind. Go onto his GitHub
[1:16:40] variawings: whats ur feedback on disc so far
[1:16:42] Ananasbaum: You see his answer there
[1:16:59] Alori_: blizz is breaking an add on because they dont want you to see enemy buffs?
[1:17:05] Ananasbaum: https://github.com/rgd87/ClassicAuraDurations/issues/21
[1:17:28] buggy_k: its like blizzard is just listening to everyone and everything now and tying to appease instead of making the game better
[1:17:57] Ananasbaum: They are still not shown
[1:18:29] Extramediums: they really want you to use detect magic on players :D
[1:18:50] shoniewow: qhy
[1:18:53] kallebalik: they should make the range for nameplates longer
[1:18:53] shoniewow: @Hydramist
[1:19:01] shoniewow: how much honor kills u farm so far?
[1:19:08] buggy_k: yea nameplates is def needed

[1:20:07] Alori_: HUH
[1:20:10] buggy_k: yea thats what im saying
[1:20:18] Underpowered1364: Because detect magic is a spell
[1:20:23] Underpowered1364: For mage only

[1:42:15] Underpowered1364: He said disc is fun but relies on team fights and your teammates dps. Seems like because of that and how most games flow atm he's enjoying shadow, because it enables more for him
