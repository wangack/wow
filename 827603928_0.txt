[2:03:26] n0sm0ke11: blizzard should hire him
[2:03:28] user_buzer: @Arnej35 but thats the main theme of pallys, holy light, like for rogues to be invisible
[2:03:29] danksly: 6 min left on hearthstone think thats still faster than a fp Kappa

[2:03:55] Shayuki: I don't think it counts? or does it now
[2:04:02] soundpraenk: @user_buzer going from zero to full every few secs is broken :D
[2:04:04] HotHotHeals: pretty sure it counts
[2:04:04] Papi_Tai: new raid boss, "TroyRex" when you pull his boss emote is "hey guys, today I'll show you how I solo a raid of 20" LUL
[2:04:05] Nethil: quest requires to earn the honor IN BG
[2:04:05] DjRasmus: Nope, but you can earn Tour of Duty achieve with the q
[2:04:05] boforskanonen: you can turn it in when you want
[2:04:08] Zivs: Turn it in a Shadowlands zone for the Tour Duty achivement @Towelliee
[2:04:20] ryzorwarlock: is tanking easier in shadowlands @Towelliee ?
[2:04:21] Juippeli: If u turn it in in 1 of the 4 SL zones, u get tour of duty achi for that zone instantly
[2:04:21] Shayuki: but you want to save the honor so that you can get ilvl 184 pvp gear next week right after reset right
[2:04:34] Cilir: morn'n towelliee
[2:04:37] user_buzer: @Arnej35 going full cloak in front of the opponent is broken also
[2:04:40] boforskanonen: and you can get achievements 1000 honor in any zone

[2:05:21] user_buzer: @Arnej35 so you want them to have useless heals?
[2:05:34] PadidinJones: You can get 2 legos with that honor
[2:05:46] dannyd1020: how much honor should everyone grind before tuesday?
[2:05:52] Moobot: Calm the spam, @40zt (warning)
[2:05:58] msmester1: what is ideal ilvl before raid? 190
[2:06:03] Shayuki: For your honor you can buy ilvl 171 pvp gear(for your slots that dont have 184) and then turn them into 184s after the weekly reset
[2:06:24] soundpraenk: @user_buzer not useless ofc, but looks like those heals needs some balance, 2 weeks in soloing m0 shouldn't be possible, and it was possible thanks to those heals mainly
[2:06:27] Casual_Oppa: think its worth farming m+ over trying to clear normal before going into hc?
[2:06:31] GRNmarkey: wish I had a long boy...
[2:06:33] Kneckt: @msmester1 180

[2:07:58] primetimezhilex: @Towelliee i already saw it on Wow head
[2:07:59] Shayuki: I'm saving 15k honor so that I get full ilvl 184 after reset
[2:08:00] msmester1: don't forget about the world boss

[2:08:57] Supers18: Towelliee normal mode still good for legendary drops
[2:08:58] Casual_Oppa: just not sure if doing a full normal clear will benefit more as we get ready for hc in the evening
[2:09:40] qtla: @Towelliee It should be easyer, its 7$ scaling instead of 10%

[4:20:41] schwertfeger: he is or a cousin
[4:20:41] tdpark_: nobble sorta confirm
[4:20:43] TheCliffyShow: That's what most people have been speculating.
[4:20:43] ZakuzaGB: no ive said this many times, the statue of the primus has 3 fingers and runecarver has 5 @Towelliee
[4:20:43] D1Chile: @Towelliee pretty much confirmed to be honest
[4:20:44] notademon: The primus is a famous weaponsmith, so its a possibility
[4:20:45] Veegore: runecarver has too many fingers
[4:20:49] Boxxor: pretty sure im the primus
[4:20:57] Praetour: The VA is the same as well isn't it?
[4:20:59] igiveyoudispear: I think the Primus was the Runecarvers apprentice
[4:21:15] Oldduketree007: Runecarver is runecarver Primus is the armour smith
[4:21:24] HighlordTrazim: probably his brother
[4:21:27] TheCliffyShow: Or the statue is wrong.
[4:21:37] MuttonChopins: Blizzard will just say it was a spelling error LUL
[4:21:40] warpride777: i thought he was sylvanis' bdsm friend
[4:21:42] SVVGordon: this blacksmithing sure would be easier if i had more than 3 freaking fingers
[4:21:43] fluh_: or blizz didnt get to finish his fingers KEKW
[4:21:45] warrenny: Its a statue not a person like @thecliffyshow said
[4:21:50] Plebwing: Because statues are famous for their accuracy KEKW
[4:21:56] MuttonChopins: WHat if he was the apprentice for Primus
[4:22:02] D1Chile: @Oldduketree007 watch last video on runecarver and jailer will prob change ur opinion
