[2:21:05] Notsohappy: will have a really small but dedicated scene
[2:21:10] Zodzorlol: Retail has been doomed for 10 years, kinda shocked it still has players. No idea if there is more people playing classic or not though?
[2:21:11] Shewqt: Drainer, is jungle a skill comped in 3s ? compared to all other combs

[2:22:00] Garozos: most people on retail never play pvp
[2:22:03] DjxTV: Preach let slip that Blizzard know nobody wants Cata and that they don't know what to do with Classic after Wrath
[2:22:09] gollazin: exactly, its inclusive, every1 at the same level not knowing wtf is going on
[2:22:13] DjxTV: He found out on his trip to Blizz HQ
[2:22:25] Smupai: you have no metrics you can compare

[2:22:44] Matzefyr: im Eu
[2:22:45] Infinity_tv: lol wat
[2:22:59] whyjlo: POE is certainly not a MMORPG, its basically a single player game. (its a great game but certainly not MMO)
[2:23:03] Matzefyr: nah its active in both eu and na
[2:23:15] Rakgthora: Do so many people play RS3? cause OSRS only has like 100k players usually less

[2:24:25] Shewqt: add a third MS to warriors ! like when then execute on cast you get 100% less healing
[2:24:28] kwlski01: they gonna fk up even wotlk Sadge but yea its going to be better than retail KEKW
[2:24:33] Juginator: mythic+ dungeons, mythic raid difficulty, rated battlegrounds, cross realm
[2:24:37] DjxTV: @apemasterx id rather them ruin wrath than be stuck playing 284 meta for another 10 years
[2:24:50] hollowlalz: they should just do an AT serveur bis for pvp
[2:24:55] dope_irl: true @Drainerx
[2:25:30] Garozos: make all old raids and loot scale to current new raid

[3:03:00] suchskillmuchimpress: yeah bans would make it so much more fun
[3:03:17] whyjlo: if u banned enemy classes then only multiclassers would be able to complete and most r1 players who are in tourneys cant play more than 1
[3:03:25] Zodzorlol: Another 5 ads kek
[3:03:49] suchskillmuchimpress: tough shit for op meta abusers
[3:03:51] insecson: What about like a solo shuffle style tournament ?
[3:03:57] Cismoz: @whyjlo so you are saying only good players would be able to  compete and not people carried by their onetrick class?
[3:04:35] MastaHades: @whyjlo And that would be more relevant
[3:04:38] whyjlo: i dont think comparing being an OTP in league to having 1 class in wow is fair
[3:04:50] suchskillmuchimpress: almost all tournament players are multiclassers
[3:04:56] Delusionxy: for wow it would maybe make sense to ban comps imo, but we don't have 150 classes with 4 abilities to ban a few of them
[3:04:58] whyjlo: getting a char to max level and equipping it and learning how to pvp takes hundreds or thousands of hours
[3:05:00] delusionszx: @whyjlo they should make multiclassing easier
[3:05:02] Kiefn_: i can see them banning maps
[3:05:20] defo_xxx: would you rather ban classes or specs ?
[3:05:28] whyjlo: i agree that banning classes would make tournaments very fun to watch, im just saying that most tourney players wouldnt participate
[3:05:37] biffedx: banning specs makes more sense yeah
[3:05:46] Seraphpy: !talents
[3:05:49] Seraphpy: !talent
[3:05:52] MastaHades: @whyjlo Yeah but people can be carried by the patch or smtg, let the people ban classes/specs, the meta would be more diverse and fun
[3:05:52] suchskillmuchimpress: wdym most tournament players are multiclassers anyway
[3:05:52] Seraphpy: !spec
[3:06:02] suchskillmuchimpress: maybe spec bans would make more sense tho yeah
[3:06:51] akadhtwq: ye 1 spec ban per team, everybody would ban hpala, tru or tru
[3:07:19] suchskillmuchimpress: I think ele would get banned
[3:07:43] Garozos: nah hpala ban 100%
[3:07:50] whyjlo: @suchskillmuchimpress certainly not true that most tournament players are multiclassers
[3:07:50] Inoxity: do you think this comp is better than thunder?
[3:07:59] whyjlo: and playing few classes doesnt mean you do so at a competitive level neither
[3:08:09] Kreynz: banning ele is probably wiser than banning hpal lol
[3:08:24] Spiro89: for sure
[3:08:46] insecson: Lmao fuck rogues
[3:09:00] Kreynz: ban ele shaman, destro warlock, affliction warlock
[3:09:09] Vaxhim: ban dpriest, rsham, hpal

[3:10:28] penguinpuncher13: chat gets baited 20 hours a day go outside pserver players
[3:10:28] whyjlo: ye against rmp if u banned disc u get rid of the rmp for good, it doesnt function with any other healer no way.
[3:10:50] yuzoki: @whyjlo druid
[3:11:18] akadhtwq: bruh, ima revolutionar Riot implement 1 spec ban per team now drxDrink
[3:11:29] akadhtwq: i mean blizzard
[3:11:46] whyjlo: @yuzoki in my opinion you'd lack the damage to setup and execute go's. It's so easy for the RMP to setup the priest to fear, but casting clones is way harder plus druid can't dps during the dances as well as a priest can
[3:11:53] Kreynz: does shadow still have greater fade?
[3:12:01] whyjlo: not to mention druid healing sucks, thats why theres 0 druids in top 100
[3:12:24] suchskillmuchimpress: druid can only play lsd
[3:12:30] suchskillmuchimpress: and get boosted by 2 op classes
[3:12:46] insecson: So wrath pvp is better than retail right now ?
[3:12:52] NftPlayerbase: im currently the highest rated rdruid/war in 2s
[3:12:56] NftPlayerbase: and its sick hard
[3:13:06] Deshi_basara: LUL private server andys
[3:13:15] catchxdd: also feels better to press buttons as dps, spells actually do something
[3:13:20] Kreynz: i guess on wotlk damage comes from your actually abilities instead of cds so it feels like your actions are more impactful and enemies are easier to predict
