[2:02:25] Kingconn223: it basically means its going to be allot harder lmao
[2:02:32] Dalsonson: Pre-nerf meaning hard but doable
[2:02:42] Dalsonson: If it's game-breaking, obv it wont be in there
[2:03:05] Dalsonson: Ok, so if we say pre-nerf is hard, post-nerf is easy
[2:03:12] Dalsonson: Or, if you just want to use the term harder

[2:12:31] xwalonosx: @dalsonson no they get cucked by mechanics, a lot less uptime for melee in TBC.. so they aren’t top tier
[2:12:44] Streamcrush: I mained Ret in TBC, you needed one for raids to keep up some judges, blessings, and if you were Horde you had okay dps
[2:12:57] Streamcrush: seal of blood was way better than seal of command
[2:13:02] spacemarine55: Someone’s gotta puck up the weapons on KT lol
[2:13:03] we_are_whomp: i mean rogues are best dps outside of hunters even with melee unfriendly mechanics

[2:20:29] Dalsonson: Isnt Arcane pretty good in PvE, and you'll go frost for PvP anyways
[2:20:46] snoo_32: so TBC has staff, glaives, bow, and anything else for leggos ?
[2:20:53] xwalonosx: @dalsonson p5 arcane absolutely pumps in pve
[2:20:59] Artivicii: tier 4 set probably?
[2:21:02] Dalsonson: Yea, so Fire has to be the meme spec
[2:21:04] Aphro_Samurai: think it was fire till t5 4 pc
[2:21:08] Aphro_Samurai: then arcane
[2:21:09] DocsMistake: TBC is just Glaives and Bow, Leggo staff is from Vanilla
[2:21:16] ryurax: What do you think about shadowlands? HOnestly, not that great for me
[2:21:17] snoo_32: ok ty docs
[2:21:23] kershh: Arcane had mana issues no?
[2:21:23] Dalsonson: Unless he's talking about Atiesh
[2:21:31] snoo_32: atiesh yes sorry
[2:21:42] Phindrius: There's technically the leggos from TK, but they were only temporary items :P
[2:21:43] xwalonosx: @kershh not with the 4 piece they were decent.
[2:21:48] Artivicii: @ryurax extremely fun with friends or a guild, otherwise kinda boring and too grindy
[2:21:54] RogueBear: Mana Issues should be the name of the spec
[2:21:59] Aphro_Samurai: you just downrank frostbolt as arcane after 4p r5
[2:22:01] Hellifyoudont66: Mana almost didn't exist in Wrath once you were geared, because everybody went for MP5.
[2:22:04] 1godofwar0: frost, sub struggled in pve
[2:22:08] Aphro_Samurai: t5*
[2:22:35] ryurax: I wish they just kept artifacts and improved them honestly, i will never forgive blizzard for that
[2:22:36] xwalonosx: @hellifyoudont66 mp5 is bis
[2:22:46] RogueBear: i would be a happy mage if they just got rid of arcane all together. i kinda hate the spec
[2:22:46] Bigmann109: wotlk arcane mages were OP, mana wasnt to much an issue if you knew how to use it correctly
[2:23:26] 1godofwar0: the private server boys say atiesh is bis for warlock till a t5 weapon I believe from the Eye
[2:23:32] ryurax: I mean, what they are doing right now is remove a system to replace it, but it's at best on parity with the previous, and usually worse
[2:23:44] ryurax: Artifacts, they could have expanded on them, they were the perfect base
[2:23:49] Aphro_Samurai: @RogueBear you cant get rid of arcane as the other 2 specs "technially" wouldnt exist without arcane. Lore wise
[2:23:50] xwalonosx: SL systems are dogshit
[2:24:08] Dalsonson: You turn it in back in STV lmao
[2:24:18] Infinitepeeep: love classic
[2:24:18] Jayskillet90: What nameplates are you using?
[2:24:27] xwalonosx: Here is the maw and torg - what people hate most. Now here is a new maw area and a torghast raid
[2:24:33] Haru_G: hey folks do we know if we can start with a boosted char for tbc? or we gonna have to start at lvl 1?
[2:24:35] RogueBear: @Aphro_Samurai i know they cant/wont but its a shitty spec game play wise imo. i said i would be happy if they canned it. not that i thought they ever would
[2:24:44] Artivicii: slootGun slootGun
[2:25:14] Dalsonson: I just dont know why m+ doesnt give 213 gear and m15 valor give 226
[2:25:53] othraerir: cuz then you could trade raid gear
[2:25:56] Artivicii: grats
[2:26:04] xwalonosx: Cause then nobody would raid, and that’s all wow devs care about these days
[2:26:06] Dalsonson: But they've always done that, top end m+ giving heroic ilvl gear
[2:26:19] Red_Dead_Redeem: @Haru_G you can purchase abosst for TBC

[2:27:02] dwolters_the_zombieman: i wish tbc beta is out
[2:27:10] Dalsonson: Like, I want it to be good, but I can't find fun playing it
[2:27:16] Red_Dead_Redeem: @Haru_G oh also you can't boost blood elf or draenai
[2:27:22] ZIKERZ: grats on that ding
[2:27:28] ryurax: The biggest problem i have at the moment with wow is exactly this new expansion new system stuff, i wish they would just improve on what they have
[2:27:39] ryurax: But with covenants i think it;s pretty clear what their mentaility is

[2:29:12] Dalsonson: Buying AOTC exists for the achievement
[2:29:18] ryurax: It's not the worst expansion, but i do think the new systems, are not good, probably not even much better than azerite

[2:30:29] KaisenSiru: Shadowlands is fine. Still having a blast with everything.
[2:30:33] Sandman_88: I very clearly remember you saying "shadowlands 50/50 of it being a good expansion" before launch

[2:33:07] Lifeline09: take the L on shadowlands...?  im having a really good time i would not say shadowlands is a bad expansion at all

[2:34:59] ryurax: I mean, i don;t think shadow is worse, but i did not play for quite a bit, so.... Actions speak louder than words i guess
[2:35:10] ryurax: I did not play a lot of bfa either though
[2:35:20] Dalsonson: I WANT SLands to be good, I BEG of it to be good, but it's the consistent imbalance of PvE/PvP, M+ to Raid, a leveling system where Storyline > Threads
[2:35:34] snoo_32: i think there is a troll village south of where you are for horde, you can pick up quests theremaybe towellie.

[2:35:58] LegoCoin: I dont think it ever existed really and kind of let down even on release
[2:35:58] secondarych: :(
[2:36:01] ryurax: Is a failure
[2:36:02] drRoswell: its called shitlands
[2:36:13] Colt_Engineer: I'm enjoying shadowlands man
[2:36:17] Watchmeshine86: Castle Nathria > Uldir,  Manifest of pride > Infestation . PvE aspect of end game is overall better than BFA launch
[2:36:19] dwolters_the_zombieman: yes
[2:36:21] SumZeroGG: The SL story is captivating, I am hoping the systems issues are resolved to work with it.
[2:36:22] LegoCoin: I know shandowlands was the least played expansion out of all of them I have played.
[2:36:28] Kogeta: Just be a pvper
[2:36:37] xideontv: 9.0.x is taking forever
[2:36:38] Dalsonson: idk, 6.1 was good
[2:36:47] LegoCoin: basicly went back to playing other zones farming things
[2:36:48] drRoswell: me too i was WOD and BFA survivor žbut man shitlands is on whole another level of bad
[2:36:49] Dalsonson: Knowing 6.2 was the end made it a bad patch
[2:36:55] Dalsonson: But the content in 6.2 was good
[2:36:55] othraerir: wait, go get the bag!!!!!
[2:36:57] enthroned1: whazs wrong with shadowlands? lack of content or just boring?
[2:37:07] xideontv: refarming azerite powers? no thanks
[2:37:17] Red_Dead_Redeem: I played during Cata and WOD those were tough times
[2:37:17] othraerir: bottom
[2:37:23] DocsMistake: its at the bottom of the waterfall underwater
[2:37:25] spacemarine55: Shadowlands was dead from the moment Silvanas fought bolvar that shit was the most cringe shit I’ve seen over the years
[2:37:34] tronbadgames: @Towelliee i get that you might have these opinions.. but most of us dont play for a living.. think shadowlands is way better than bfa
[2:37:43] dwolters_the_zombieman: i never been so disappointed in a exp until now
[2:37:50] Tears_0f_sin: @enthroned1 nothing really the content is actually good, the raid and dungeons are both good it's just vocal minority thing and people not liking they can't get easy gear
[2:37:51] secondarych: HYPERS
[2:38:01] MisterPeace: on a solo levle bfa was fun
[2:38:05] Red_Dead_Redeem: worst exp ever for me is still WOD
[2:38:20] SumZeroGG: Anima is impossible to get enough of also
[2:38:21] Dalsonson: Ok, not to bring this debate back up, and I'm not asking for another timeout/ban, but can you defend WoD Towel?
[2:38:22] drRoswell: i kinda liked BFA
[2:38:27] SumZeroGG: the time to anima conversion sucks
[2:38:34] drwest132: we just need tbc or a great patch
[2:38:42] Red_Dead_Redeem: LUL
[2:38:47] enthroned1: @tears_0f_sin sounds like a not so bad exp but i am out of the loop since Legion release
[2:38:47] ventu105: why Shadowland Suck?
[2:38:54] snoo_32: blizzard had TBC in a glass in case shadowlands failed Kappa
[2:39:08] dwolters_the_zombieman: i cant even upgrade with valor
[2:39:17] LegoCoin: yeah dont they know the 1% is never the way to go Cough SC2 Cough HOS
[2:39:19] Tears_0f_sin: @enthroned1 not as good as legion but  better than bfa was and the content is actually solid, fun raid tbh
[2:39:25] Tears_0f_sin: but ya know how people are
[2:39:27] Dalsonson: Ok, now I can see your side of the WoD argument
[2:39:27] KaisenSiru: esfandW
[2:39:33] Red_Dead_Redeem: Anima to time ratio is not balanced to say the least
[2:39:48] ventu105: yep shadowland suck dude thas why I start playing classic or I would have to cancel my account
[2:40:02] Watchmeshine86: Dunno clear the raid get like 1250 anima for a 2 hour investment isnt bad
[2:40:02] Murphybrown: 35 anima, greatest reward for doing dungeons
[2:40:03] Pooshs: WOD at least had a great professions
[2:40:09] secondarych: damn...
[2:40:18] MisterPeace: @ventu105 that is exactly what i started doing lol
[2:40:22] enthroned1: @tears_0f_sin yea people are weird
[2:40:24] dariuspossess: hello
[2:40:29] mwchaos: You know it's really bad when the only thing you can do is raid log and level alts or play other games in between your off days
[2:40:35] cruzeal: share holder call is gonna be monkaS
[2:40:35] LegoCoin: everyone is playing Outriders and Animal Crossing LUL
[2:40:44] Red_Dead_Redeem: time for blizz to take an L and try to ramp out another expansion real quick
[2:40:45] mwchaos: There is 0 incentive to grind anything, even dungeons are not enticing to grind in SL
[2:40:53] Dalsonson: Here's one way they can make SLands better
[2:40:56] Quimby54: @mwchaos why is that a bad thing? downtime is always a good thing in an mmo, having a constant grind is a great way to burn out
[2:41:05] Watchmeshine86: @mwchaos You just described classic lol
[2:41:08] Kromede: towOny
[2:41:13] Dalsonson: and I don't think it will pass by developers, but hear me out Towel
[2:41:14] cruzeal: towOny
[2:41:22] ventu105: @MisterPeace you cool dude
[2:41:31] mwchaos: Cause there should be things worth grinding for outside of raid @Quimby54
[2:41:44] snoo_32: atleast in classic you can level alts or stock up on gold for TBC. Something to look forward too
[2:41:46] mwchaos: im sorry but grinding for sockets on gear is not exciting lol
[2:41:54] Kromede: lol
[2:41:54] Red_Dead_Redeem: LUL
[2:41:55] cruzeal: lol
[2:41:55] SumZeroGG: LOL
[2:41:59] cruzeal: d'awww
[2:41:59] Supers18: LOL
[2:42:01] Infinitepeeep: terryb1Raider terryb1Raider terryb1Raider terryb1Raider
[2:42:06] SumZeroGG: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny
[2:42:06] snoo_32: haha cute.
[2:42:07] TacticalWee: awwwwww
[2:42:10] Red_Dead_Redeem: can we play? lol
[2:42:10] cabalish: towOny towOny towOny
[2:42:14] cruzeal: towOny towOny
[2:42:15] ventu105: 20 thing why Shadowland suck?
[2:42:22] dwolters_the_zombieman: shit why do dungeons when i dont get loot or why do wq when rewards are shit
[2:42:37] Dalsonson: First, make m+ 213 base upgrade to 226 with Valor via KSM. Revert all changes on gear in raids. Give us one selection of gear from each activity out of the Vault at a potential of 233 (m+ would require doing like an 19 or a 20 on the week, thats fine)
[2:42:49] Pooshs: 1. targetting changed
[2:42:57] KaisenSiru: esfandPains
[2:43:04] ventu105: yes no rewards in classic dungeon wtf Blizz
[2:43:05] Red_Dead_Redeem: esfandW
[2:44:04] ventu105: I will cancel my account if it wasn't for classic hope New World is not good BLIZZARD
[2:44:39] Dalsonson: Hell, Wizard101 is better than WoW rn
[2:44:42] IllBarium: shadowlands sucks cause the only thing you get for doing anything is a future abandoned garbage useless currency
[2:44:46] Dalsonson: I believe it, it's better than Retail

[2:47:03] endless314: InFlight addon does that for  ya
[2:47:06] armetyz: the thing i liked is not on the expansion, it was the leveling switching expansions
[2:47:20] PinkCyberKitten: have a great night,
[2:47:26] ventu105: lol
[2:47:34] Anacondal67: InFlight Taxi Timer

[2:47:47] krajar96: @Anacondal67 yeah thats the one, thanks :)

[2:48:48] DocsMistake: just go with the classic, Peggle
[2:48:55] Detonite: If it is the same for everyone, what is the big problem really. Just enjoy the game and chill : )
[2:48:56] kroknows101: yeah, my warrior and paladin are both stuck at 205 exactly. Just started doing M+ in the last week. Already feels worthless to push for valor upgrades.
[2:48:56] Red_Dead_Redeem: I want to put lady moonberry in a blender
[2:49:11] ventu105: PLZ Blizzard Fix Shadowland direction it has taken
[2:49:19] Dalsonson: I mean, you can get pretty crafty with end game. 2 turn one shot a boss
[2:49:34] xmedpakx: just play Valheim :)
[2:49:41] Artivicii: valor feels pointless until 9.1 maybe
[2:49:42] 1godofwar0: good for what it is @towelliee
[2:50:13] Dalsonson: So, can I give you my list of possible ideas to fix SLands Towel?
[2:50:15] kroknows101: I ran 9 dungeons and got 3 pieces and 2 of those were shit stats and not worth upgrading.
[2:50:17] Landyy: truee
[2:50:22] TheUnknowing: Yeah not as easy
[2:50:34] xmedpakx: i do the same thing with my friends
[2:50:39] xmedpakx: we funnel and stack
[2:50:42] Artivicii: then u gotta get the key u need too KEKW
[2:50:44] han_saro: And that its the best piece since Valor is capped and you dont want to waste on non-optimal gear
[2:50:45] ventu105: Play ESO and forget WoW there's a new expansion coming or hold till august New World is coming lol
[2:50:46] LegoCoin: I loved PCP gear being different gear
[2:50:51] LegoCoin: PVP*
[2:50:52] JokaThS: @Towelliee ive done almoste 20 dungeons this week i only got 3 items i want out from all slots
[2:50:55] Artivicii: PCP gear KEKW
[2:51:08] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: LegoCoin: I loved PCP
[2:51:17] Federaldemon: PVP players also had 233 weapons Before Mythic even released KEKW @Towelliee
[2:51:56] ventu105: @NiceLikeRice_ yes is classic come download it and enjoy the adventure
[2:52:03] TheUnknowing: I mean im not quitting retail but other than raiding and doing the few m+'s a week that i do I have no other reason to play
[2:52:14] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: If only Torghast had some end rewards besides soul ash that you could farm for replayability.
[2:52:47] Bakuryuha96: I'm taking a break from retail for a bit. I just cant deal with it anymore atm

[2:53:05] we_are_whomp: prob 7 for eranikus since hes 55
[2:53:11] jayplayscorner: @Towelliee unholy dk is my main on retail and it hasnt gotten any love lal expac for pvp legion unholy felt so good but slands feels clunky
[2:53:15] 1godofwar0: there is a blood elf in a cave in swamp of sorrows that will give a st quest
[2:53:19] Dalsonson: First, make m+ 213 base with option to upgrade to 226 with Valor via KSM. Revert all changes on gear in raids. Give us one selection of gear from each activity out of the Vault at a potential of 233 (m+ would require doing like an 19 or a 20 on the week, thats fine)
[2:53:27] LegoCoin: I kind of hope they make it easier on alts for expansion soon it would be more fun
[2:53:29] Dalsonson: I genuinely think this will fix PvE gearing
[2:53:36] nox503: nox503 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! <3
[2:53:40] FryeTV: @WarfusedTV Theyre too busy being the best melee in PVE.
[2:53:53] Infinitepeeep: im noticing questie is missing just a few side quests
[2:54:01] Infinitepeeep: here and there
[2:54:10] 1godofwar0: he doesn't have a mark, you have to talk to him...rp shit
[2:54:26] Dalsonson: One from each row is a bit much
[2:54:33] LegoCoin: yeah I think they need to make it easier for alts
[2:54:35] TheUnknowing: I think that is a bit too much, i feel like reverting the m+ and raid changes would be enough
[2:54:37] Dalsonson: But the 213 base to 226 with KSM is a VERY likely option
[2:54:38] jayplayscorner: @FryeTV really? unholy is so bad in pvp necrotic strike is like its bread and butter and no one ever takes it
[2:55:00] LegoCoin: we had a blast levlign different clases but then could not really effectively use those alts
[2:55:09] snoo_32: can you guys iagine what expansion comes after SL ? we fought everything. What will be the next expansion villian ...or is this the end of the world.....of warcraft?
[2:55:12] TheUnknowing: But this will be like any other expac, it will become good with the .2 patch probably
[2:55:13] DrNikoss: the least they can do is some kind of bad luck protection from the friggin weekly vault
[2:55:20] FryeTV: @WarfusedTV Yes Unholy is extremely good in PVE. They do need love in PVP but frost is there and quite good
[2:55:29] FryeTV: in pvp
[2:55:34] Dalsonson: Wait, ok, lemme clarify this Towel
[2:55:44] ventu105: Guys Outriders coming soon
[2:55:46] Dalsonson: You think 233 on a 21 weekly isn't hard enough?
[2:55:47] yoriiiii_: @snoo_32 there's always the voidlords
[2:56:03] xmedpakx: a 21 m plus is very hard
[2:56:08] Artivicii: 233 should be gated behind +18
[2:56:09] Dalsonson: I'm curious if you personally believe m+ should ever see 233 in the vault
[2:56:13] Artivicii: or give us back warforged KEKW
[2:56:14] Dalsonson: NO, 18 is way too low
[2:56:18] StealingYourWifi: What's the average player ilvl that you think? 200?
[2:56:21] xmedpakx: 20 -21
[2:56:22] TheUnknowing: I mean I think it would be great if 15's dropped even like 220
[2:56:25] xmedpakx: for 233 gear
[2:56:30] Dalsonson: If a 14 gives 226, and I even think 226 should be 15s
[2:56:33] DrNikoss: bring titanforged back Kappa
[2:56:36] FryeTV: @StealingYourWifi At least 210 average
[2:56:56] Dalsonson: Slap it on a 20 or 21, yea, it's at a high enough level your average player wont see it anytime soon
[2:57:21] StealingYourWifi: @FryeTV I don't think alot of players are above 205 to be honest
[2:57:49] FryeTV: @StealingYourWifi I believe 210 is vault ilvl for just completing a +6 or 7
[2:57:53] Robmit: @Towelliee Do you think Blizz might announce a WoW token for TBC since players use third party gold sellers anyways? Do you think that would hurt the game?
[2:58:23] ShattsBassoon: m+ reedwarding stuff to otugear raid content is a horrrible idea
[2:58:25] snoo_32: i think casuals will afk farm Bgs for free gear. You'd be surprised how lazy casuals are for gear. Hell i do it sometimes too when i feel lazy. Wod Was welfare epics i think.
[2:58:26] DrNikoss: the problem is i can break up with my so, but i cant break up with blizzard LUL
[2:58:27] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: It's like Donald Glover said about KIx cereal being the hand jobs of cereal "This good, but you know what I *really* want?"

[3:28:28] xmedpakx: allowed*
[3:28:40] Clausswoop: @Towelliee griefing is toxic. Im not a big fan of asmongold, but griefing is just lame and should be banned.
[3:28:50] Dalsonson: I think he broke stream sniping, and you can maybe look into harassing on WoW's end bc at some point it becomes oppressive
[3:28:54] Artivicii: LOL
[3:28:57] TheUnknowing: I mean it was excessive griefing so i imaging that has to be against the rules.
[3:28:59] Artivicii: camperrr

[3:29:57] TheUnknowing: Obviously both sides were wrong for sure
[3:30:04] Dalsonson: I'm not either, but the "nobody" did do things that COULD warrant a ban
[3:30:05] chrslp: Being drunk in Classic was so much worse than it is now LUL

[3:36:49] LegoCoin: let me go get some tokens and sell for gold and get someone to carry me through things because I am a lazy POS
[3:36:54] tedol: is pay to play - pay to win?
[3:36:58] Dalsonson: Token into BC?
[3:36:59] Muffyv: NOOOOO
[3:37:01] Dalsonson: Like, WoW Token?
[3:37:05] its_andyd: never said its the worst, just a part of the climate nowadays
[3:37:06] secondarych: Token would be good for TBC
[3:37:11] Dalsonson: Give me that please
[3:37:18] niebvelungen: lol why tho
[3:37:24] Dalsonson: Why not lmao
[3:37:24] 7aaze: god i hope. its so sketchy RWT on classic
[3:37:28] niebvelungen: gold is inflated anyways
[3:37:46] AshixBorden: Moving to a PvE server was the best decision I ever made.
[3:38:14] niebvelungen: i am getting my gold by boosting dudes its so ez to get 700g just 2-4h
[3:38:19] endless314: that's why #somechanges
[3:38:20] iitsgolf: I hope they do I don’t want to fight a billion boys for herbs to grind the 10 k
[3:38:28] Dalsonson: I think it's like 3:1 the token is put in, fuck that 3:2 odd you put out
[3:38:28] iitsgolf: Bots
[3:38:36] rocthenite: asmongold will move on to ashes, which looks like it overhype mmo number 321
[3:39:23] niebvelungen: so what would the ideal token gold to money ratio @Towelliee
[3:39:27] Dalsonson: 10k flying cost @iitsgolf ?
[3:39:28] niebvelungen: *be

[3:39:51] niebvelungen: 100 KEKW
[3:39:58] niebvelungen: what would you do with 100
[3:40:06] TheUnknowing: I really have no issues with tokens in tbc or classic, i think its fine.
[3:40:22] Degenr8t: fair
[3:40:24] Artivicii: slootBoomer dammit tow
[3:40:29] rocthenite: what do you think of ashes, i feel it promising too much
[3:40:31] niebvelungen: no too much
[3:40:32] anty_panda: fuck that
[3:40:33] secondarych: lets hope they add token to TBC
[3:40:37] Dalsonson: I think 1k for a token is fine
[3:40:40] niebvelungen: like 400 or so would be fine
[3:40:43] 1godofwar0: China servers already have it
[3:40:43] Dalsonson: Even right now, it's fine
[3:40:56] AshixBorden: Just botting druids everywhere in retail
[3:40:57] Murphybrown: $20 to unlock flying
[3:40:58] Degenr8t: 1k costed about 20 dollars up until the TBC announcement, 1k will prob cost 15 bucks in TBC
[3:41:00] Ablackdruid: The best argument against the token is "yeah but still..."
[3:41:08] Markaveli007: i thought in China they already have tokens in wow classic...
[3:41:11] iitsgolf: Idk I’d be happy with like 1.8k for a token it’s 20 dollars you know
[3:41:17] 321boop: TBC dailies alone is 100g per day per character
[3:41:34] niebvelungen: @iitsgolf keep dreaming
[3:41:36] NOHITJEROME: hi towelliee
[3:41:36] snoo_32: blizzard minus well go all out :P i would love 58 boosts some wow tokens, and maybe  more guild support. Wow is a fun  social game and it is a life style :)
[3:41:39] NOHITJEROME: hope you are having a great night
[3:41:47] LegoCoin: yep testing, testing, contract tracing, and isolating LUL
[3:42:05] SageRuskiy: Why did they remove weather from retail slootPH
[3:42:12] SageRuskiy: I want rain in Bastion
[3:42:14] MrSlimeyTV: coomb
[3:42:54] NOHITJEROME: yeah they can give it time
[3:42:56] NOHITJEROME: exactly
[3:43:18] Dalsonson: 6.2
[3:43:22] Dalsonson: It started with Archimonde sales
[3:43:24] TheUnknowing: was like the end of draenor i think
[3:43:37] LegoCoin: I wonder how that will impact the AH market
[3:43:38] endless314: they will give it time to see how fucked up certain servers economy are from the absurd amount of gold ppl farmed in classic
[3:43:41] snoo_32: is there something called fel weed that is good for flaks ?  Yikes. just like black lotus.
[3:43:53] thomasv2070: What you think about retail atm ? think SL is kinda boring
[3:43:55] LegoCoin: RNG hype LUL
[3:43:58] SimplyTwo: Its sooo bad lol
[3:44:03] we_are_whomp: its legit awful
[3:44:04] Felrane: I just mage aoed down 10+ so it felt super fast
[3:44:08] we_are_whomp: it took me like 160 kills to do the quest
[3:44:08] Markaveli007: 10% drop chance LUL
[3:44:10] LegoCoin: I remember this
[3:44:17] Degenr8t: SL is one of the best expansions in a long time imo
[3:44:27] Streamcrush: flashback to barrens drop rates
[3:44:45] Felrane: wrong server or id help for sure
[3:44:57] Degenr8t: what you mean lol everyones on the hate SL hype train already?
[3:44:58] TehCurt: As someone who didn't play classic or BC originally. Does levelling change much when it shifts to BC or still tough like Vanilla?
[3:45:09] we_are_whomp: the hatetalon horn from the harpies here is also awful
[3:45:17] thomasv2070: I think you getting forced in going to the maw and all the dailies in SL
[3:45:28] Degenr8t: a month ago everyone loved it i feel like the wow community is insufferable sometimes impossible to please
[3:45:36] gooni_coyg: Morning Towelliee my man. Regards from Denmark
[3:45:40] Ell_der: SL is really good imo, there is just a serious lack of content though
[3:45:41] Kromede: every zebra clearly has 4 hoofs, but doesn't drop it, mmo logic KEKW
[3:46:04] Dalsonson: Collect human Eyes in Hillsbrad, but you're lucky to see 1 drop
[3:46:28] niebvelungen: BIG TRUE
[3:46:28] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:46:31] Coaltino: TRUEING
[3:46:31] TheUnknowing: It doesnt lack content its just the content isnt really repeatable
[3:46:34] LegoCoin: yeah it has content but its not incentivised your just overwhelmed intstead
[3:46:38] Coaltino: HE JUST TRUE'D SO HARD
[3:46:42] niebvelungen: I have KSM and AoTc so i just quit
[3:46:44] Ell_der: maybe thats why it feels like a lack of content then :(
[3:46:56] gooni_coyg: !nocam
[3:46:57] niebvelungen: till 9.1
[3:47:00] TheUnknowing: in the meantime we got tbc coming up to save us for awhile
[3:47:00] Defocus: i think its cause people rush ksm aotc etc so it becomes the whole get so so keys done and wait for vault if ur alrdy 220+
[3:47:07] thomasv2070: I'm more hyped going to TBC then go back to SL atm tho
[3:47:20] Dalsonson: Covenant Questline
[3:47:21] Dalsonson: ALTS
[3:47:22] Felrane: and the more you do the more content that unlocks
[3:47:30] rocthenite: but yet warfount is some great amazing content? torgast isd better then warfount ever was
[3:47:36] Degenr8t: if everything in the game gave you more power everyones characters would be right back to BfA power levels and people would be complaining about that
[3:47:42] idenkaz_: whats so sad about 9.0.5 is it does nothing for most people because ksm.
[3:47:44] Dalsonson: Transmog Runs, Mount Runs, Battle Pet Dungeons
[3:48:03] Kromede: icc normal, because lich king drops a pet :)
[3:48:14] Tsunami_Samurai22: I quit because someone always bricks my mythic keys and I'm sick of jumping through hoops to get a decent group
[3:48:26] rocthenite: that doesn't make islands or warfount good
[3:48:31] thomasv2070: Remember when TBC came out ? i mean man that were the days . And then wotlk came i mean those were the high days
[3:48:33] Defocus: i think valor should drop more for lvl 10+ keys least 350 valor, 135 seems lackluster unless u enjoy spaming 2s @Towelliee
[3:48:42] snoo_32: so lots of cosmetic grinds, but not power grinds for competive PvE or PvP right ?
[3:48:42] KaisenSiru: People wanted to be in BiS pieces and that can happen. Full 226 and 233 I am good currently. I can do alts and farm all the mounts/pets/transmog/cover all four Covenents. I am covered for a good while and having a blast.
[3:48:44] Coaltino: shadowlands is a good expac. classic just feels more rewarding
[3:48:45] Dalsonson: Oh, wait, maybe you can get better gear if m+ let you upgrade to 226 Towelliee *cough cough*

[3:49:40] ryurax: I think titanforge would have been fine if you could have a secondary way of upgrading your gear
[3:49:53] Felrane: then I might do islands
[3:49:59] ryurax: The problem is not rng, the problem is when everything is rng and you cannot mitigate it
[3:50:00] mikeyteaspoon: Ok Bruce almighty
[3:50:11] Defocus: @Towelliee they need to increase valor drop for 10+ lvl keys least 350, 135 is fine if you wanna spam 2s vs 15s
[3:50:19] ZIKERZ: ur doing an nighter :O
[3:50:20] LegoCoin: yeah they need to ensure things are easily soloed most games do this for the end game farming
[3:50:42] endless314: remember, it's not just about completing the quest. they wanted you to grind too.
[3:50:49] ZIKERZ: welp its 3 am so guess i wont be going to sleep any time soon
[3:50:50] Scusio: i dont want to do all kinds of shit content for power increase. all i want is conduits gone and better gearing options in PvE
[3:50:55] Defocus: its like maw of souls all over again
[3:51:08] Sepron14: I'd like that for pvp gear as well. Get rid off the requirement to have a rank to upgrade gear! let us all have equal gear so alts can grind rating as well

[3:52:04] Dalsonson: Uldir buff kinda thing
[3:52:08] Dalsonson: I think is what he was mentioning
[3:52:24] TheUnknowing: as long as its not like benthic where you were capped at a shitty ilvl because of it
[3:52:24] Defocus: 9.0.5 is just the catch up mechanic patch for people coming into 9.1 nothing new
[3:52:34] JokaThS: also 2nd legendary and tier sets if they come back

[3:53:47] anacronz: i dont know man i only play wow for pvp
[3:53:55] Dalsonson: Thats the problem, it isnt. Right now, you NEED gear to PvP, so where do you get the gear?
[3:54:01] PadidinJones: You dont fucked up A A RON!
[3:54:17] Defocus: yeah so pay 2 win
[3:54:20] LegoCoin: he may have missed something or completely missed what people wanted - its funny how people change there mind imediately after release
[3:54:26] Dalsonson: But that 226 doe
[3:54:32] mattoxi: the no changes army influence :p
[3:54:42] anacronz: yea but versa only is not bis for most pve gear classes
[3:55:06] Defocus: but you arent doing the grind though you paying someone to do it for you. not everyone has that luxury
[3:55:10] swampt1l: couple million yeha?
[3:55:16] insanejihoon: I literally spend an entire day in PvE to get at best 1 item I can use
[3:55:23] drRoswell: not to mention pvp has never been in worse state i mean ppl play it but its cuz they have to
[3:55:30] Degenr8t: not everyone is going to feel satisfied from that too
[3:55:31] rocthenite: wait until tuesday, asmongold gonna bring down the hammer on shadowlands
[3:55:45] BubbaChubbs420: I remember a big time streamer at the beginning of the expansion complaining about the ilvl for pvp gear was too low and Blizzard  changed it
[3:55:54] Quimby54: @rocthenite you think too much Asmongold if that's the case.
[3:56:09] Dalsonson: Someone literally shanked us in our ass when we weren't looking, thats how it feels

[3:56:40] Paperz9: I miss the cata dungeon vendor days
[3:56:54] Markaveli007: holy fuck this quest lol
[3:57:09] Defocus: so you have to pay 2 win to enjoy being full 226 cause the pvp system was flaw
[3:57:41] Quimby54: @dondickrleone that happens when you're carried to glad
[3:57:43] Dalsonson: The pvp system isn't flawed, its the nature of a ranking system @Defocus
[3:57:45] rocthenite: pvp aka carried

[3:58:28] anacronz: retail now is mount farm man
[3:58:28] 3DeePee: you always make me want to get into wow again
[3:58:42] idenkaz_: other voices are louder and have more reach.
[3:58:45] ryurax: The thing is that hardcore vs casual doesn;t have to be a zero sum game

[3:59:01] Dalsonson: No, NO NO NO
[3:59:13] its_andyd: but when your subscription also includes classic, upper level management see it as fine
[3:59:14] Quimby54: @dondickrleone alot of high end PvErs were carried to glad? what are you sniffing lol
[3:59:14] endless314: so 9.0.5 didn't provide anything?
[3:59:17] BlueBeast33: I wish I cared but I care more about TBC
[3:59:26] TheUnknowing: Yeah, its looking like WoD and I mean I stuck out WoD but we will see what happens with this
[3:59:32] rocthenite: preach was all for low item drops  then his guild died because everyone quit wow
[3:59:44] snoo_32: yea they tell you who to cc, and what to do to pressure the enemy
[3:59:49] Defocus: yeah they coach you with pay 2 win
[3:59:49] Quimby54: @TheUnknowing it's looking like wod based on the first patch? that has more content than the entirety of wod?
[4:00:20] BubbaChubbs420: is McConnell glad?
[4:00:23] idenkaz_: i miss bfa
[4:00:25] TheUnknowing: @Quimby54 You totally didn't understand my statement, its looking like WoD from the perspective of how it was, the playerbase dropping / etc.
[4:00:52] Quimby54: @TheUnknowing Should
[4:01:07] Sandisy: less loot killed alts tbh. you think about it but then think again, why bother
[4:01:15] Quimby54: @TheUnknowing Should've elaborated a bit more in that comment then, looking at WoD has many different angles
[4:01:35] Dalsonson: At some point you realize your playerbase isn't happy. We've hit that point. So how hard is it to appease us?
[4:01:45] TheUnknowing: Well I figured it would have been understandable since its basically what towel was just saying lol @Quimby54
[4:02:09] rocthenite: i mean the bfa haters did made a ton of money off of shitting on wow, wow is dead who cares, bellalar got his new car
[4:02:17] BartonLua: devs are out of touch with pretty much all kind of players rn except pvpers. look at how they handled customizations when they were so well received

[4:02:47] Simmo_rs: Are you playing druid in TBC?
[4:02:48] Zansteh: oh noes
[4:02:51] Dalsonson: GET THAT CHICKEN
[4:02:58] ryurax: I think legion was way better than bfa though
[4:02:58] obeysupreme76: How about a final fantasy 14 crossover, will that help wow?
[4:02:59] Drogdorf: WutFace

[4:04:38] LegoCoin: The barrier of having to do one prior expansion is overwhelming so even new players or returning see a daunting task to catch up. This may need to change. I felt this way.
[4:04:43] Dalsonson: Experimenting is one thing. If an experiment goes wrong, you get rid of it, yea? Why did it take this long to get rid of it? To even notice it was an issue 5 months after the game dropped
[4:04:44] rocthenite: but the streamers told me JAB is evil
[4:04:53] LegoCoin: yeah casual PVE of Retial different than classic
[4:04:54] signar101: ads 1/4 :S
[4:04:56] LegoCoin: it change over time
[4:05:20] anacronz: sl is nothing like classic

[4:06:30] Defocus: wotlk expac when
[4:06:33] Sandisy: spec balance probably made people quit also. nobody wants to feel like they're dragging their team down
[4:06:34] LessQQBruh: @Towelliee Think its time you update your About Towelliee page :P
[4:06:36] Appoduece: Anyone know what nameplate addon that is? Looks so much cleaner than mine.
[4:06:37] BlueBeast33: if that happens then I guess I'm not playing 9.1
[4:06:38] DoozerDan: Retail kinda dying for my guild :S
[4:06:43] snoo_32: i like classic because each class feels like a dungeons and dragons character. In retail., each class is more of a role of dps tank heals rather than a flavorful class with a skillset.
[4:06:44] Lavacraze: @Defocus when is BFA on the classic LUL LUL
[4:06:45] Domini1001: @Towelliee  why do you think gearing system doesnt work in SL ?
[4:06:59] Defocus: wotlk classic is what im waiting on tbh
[4:06:59] Lazugo: Imagine 9.1 in august. I can litteraly finish CN in mythic in that time without trying
[4:06:59] LegoCoin: I dont see it mattering to much right now I am so far behind on my alts I welcome the more time
[4:07:05] Dalsonson: But, isn't that sad how they have a MASSIVE team on retail, a FRACTION by comparison on the Classic team, and they are shoving content at us

[4:07:38] thiccdaddygamer: the m+ changes are so sweet!  i love not having to ever raid again
[4:07:43] Coldlight1: Id actually play Legion again. Well a few patches in at least.
[4:07:49] stratiss: People have different opinions on what is good for the game. People quit in BFA, people quit in SL.
[4:07:50] Defocus: give me wotlk classic with the best lore

[4:08:07] rocthenite: @Dalsonson wha the heak are you talking about? classic was already made
[4:08:09] Dalsonson: They are giving us BC in the time it takes Retail to identify an issue in 9.0, give us a broken fucking bandaid in 9.0.5, and TRY to fix it with a 9.1 but we dont know anything about it. Within the time they gave us Naxx
[4:08:15] Streamcrush: Blizzard has had production problems since Wrath. We didn't start having these big content droughts until the Argent Tournament and Icecrown patches.
[4:08:20] thiccdaddygamer: the upgrade system is the game changer
[4:08:20] LegoCoin: I hope Blizzard is working these expansions to prepare them into Progression servers long term. Once all teh code is ready to deploy that way
[4:08:34] Coldlight1: They need the previous expansions way of getting loot + the vault
[4:08:46] onyhide: personal loot is the reason scarce loot feels so bad in SL as opposed to classic
[4:09:05] Defocus: @Towelliee im just doing herioc sire for 213 relic on alts cause i didnt do maw life
[4:09:09] Coldlight1: I think Legion after a few patches in was some of the most fun I've had in WoW, but I enjoyed other expansions too.
[4:09:30] BartonLua: legion even with its flaws was great imo
[4:09:31] Dalsonson: Wait, can we talk about something Towel?

[4:17:26] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: @Tsunami_Samurai22 I think they have a better kit for questing than most other classes. :)
[4:17:28] BlueBeast33: normal dungeons give rep until honored so it's smart to save quests in certain zones
[4:17:42] Dalsonson: Which is more impactful in BC on a Warrior/Paladin Tank? Blacksmith or JC?

[4:21:53] TanaseOS: Happened not too long ago on FFXIV from some guy fishing
[4:21:57] Effusive: monkaS
[4:22:31] HotHotHeals: all mages are dicks
[4:22:44] PadidinJones: if he dies he dies

[4:23:04] Felrane: swear when bots come out at night the server freaks out
[4:23:05] Sandisy: lag should not lock up the game on your pc tho. something else going on
[4:23:33] snoo_32: pagle seems ok alliance side classic.
[4:24:47] Hjolt: what do you mean, isnt bot data contained in whatever machine its stored on? and it just results in movement inside the game like any other player input?
[4:25:00] iitsgolf: @snoo_32 I started on pagel not bad server I hope more people showed up I transferred to grob cause of no one ever online
[4:25:29] Felrane: its a nice chain that will lead you into felwood

[4:28:20] Dalsonson: You interrupted him in the batching timeframe
[4:28:37] Dalsonson: Unless TBC is being built on the SLands
[4:28:42] Effusive: maybe because tbc is based off 9.0 client?
[4:28:43] Dalsonson: It was listed as Classic Beta
[4:28:43] Honvar: Because Shadowlands is back in a beta phase Kappa
[4:29:03] chrslp: LUL

[4:35:02] pyfoxx: so you can ignore any pile that isn't glowing
[4:35:06] PadidinJones: So you saying theres a chance?
[4:35:08] Zansteh: the mud must be glowing to contain the cobalt jrussLaugh

[4:40:36] ryurax: The fact that wow is still the most played mmo though is funny, and telling of how much mmos suck at the moment
[4:41:06] sil3nt48: @ryurax is it really though? ffxiv numbers shouldnt be that far behind, if not ahead.
[4:41:20] ryurax: Final fantasy is below wow

[4:42:01] ryurax: Eso i think is in a lot of trouble right now, and i think in the next few years it will decline a bit, or at least stay stagnant
[4:42:11] N3llee: true
[4:42:22] iitsgolf: I wonder how many regular Joe’s are going to get beta
[4:42:23] mikejames01: eso wil be fine
[4:42:24] ryurax: Forums are super censorious, an super trigger happy with suspensions and bans, much more than before, and the devs are lazy
[4:42:32] chrslp: Nothing has hit quite like WoW hit me when I first started playing
[4:42:34] ryurax: You make your own guesses.
[4:42:41] geokouts: any good addon for the convenant mission table?
[4:42:53] ryurax: Not the wow forums, the eso forums
[4:42:53] mikejames01: eso is a ok and no issues
[4:43:02] postboy710: yeah true
[4:43:12] ryurax: The wow forums are fine actually
[4:43:17] Ezekyler: your game is a piece of detritus Kappa
[4:43:28] 1godofwar0: im gonna say it, ashes is the new mmo that ive thought has a chance sine gw2 launched in like 2011
[4:43:37] Paramourn: the loot boxes are so freaking expensive in ESO
[4:43:48] Jarlan23: Do you think we'll see a big MMO boom like there was from 2008-2015?
[4:43:53] N3llee: river of teas killed it for me
[4:43:59] N3llee: tears*
[4:44:03] ryurax: Eso is definitely not good
[4:44:09] mikejames01: I love wow and eso my 2 favs
[4:44:17] ryurax: The direction they are taking is bad
[4:44:19] porowozek: ESO wants money for every fart you make
[4:44:26] swampt1l: im just waiting for that Elder scrolls 6
[4:44:26] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:44:27] tigzie: and no capes/cloaks :(
[4:44:27] ArchmageSora: @1godofwar0 Not sure if you backed the right race horse then. Kappa
[4:44:36] CrusaderNero: I played ESO alot on my Xbox. Then I got a new PC and was going to play it there. Found out progress dont cross over, so I stopped playing
[4:44:48] Tuppe: ESO feels like a _Single Player game with MMO sprinkled in as filler
[4:44:58] N3llee: they still suffer from lag and discoonect issues even worse in big pvp battles
[4:45:02] ryurax: I think the biggest problem with eso is actually the devs lazy approach with the game
[4:45:22] ryurax: They don't actually try to make the game better, they just keep the wheel spinning as they say
[4:45:54] Tuppe: If you Treat ESO as a Single Player RPG, its fine. But thats it. Questing is fun
[4:46:10] Jarlan23: swtor started off super strong
[4:46:12] ryurax: Also, the raids, are generally not even close to as good as wow
[4:46:23] akulan: I've tryed to get into eso over the years but just never grabed me
[4:46:25] Ezekyler: SWTOR engine was the first problem
[4:46:27] ColdChillXI: I hope they revamp swtor
[4:46:29] ChosenGenetics: !tbc

[4:46:33] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:46:40] toooldtoplay75: ESO is pretty packed
[4:46:41] ryurax: I think eso is one of those games that would really benefit from a m+ like system to keep content relevant instead of nerfing everyone again and again
[4:46:47] swampt1l: Anthem died twice LUL
[4:46:59] swampt1l: skyrim
[4:47:08] bodli1125: eso is like the past games its just have the bigges content ever not even wow comes near
[4:47:25] toooldtoplay75: shit loads of players and it is getting better with every expack
[4:47:28] CrusaderNero: I'd continue playing ESO if my progress on xbox was also on PC
[4:47:33] akulan: agreed
[4:47:34] MrGattz: g'morning chat sacWAVE
[4:47:42] ryurax: It's definitely not getting better, if anything it;s stagnating
[4:47:46] Dalsonson: tbh, I don't know Elder Scrolls
[4:47:48] bodli1125: the problem wath eso will have it will be at some point overloaded with content
[4:48:00] swampt1l: just the elder scrolls part alone will print money
[4:48:00] Coaltino: ANOTHER TRUE
[4:48:01] ryurax: SInce morrowind, average playerbase has been stagnant
[4:48:07] heiligerhuegel: sttill waiting for a good lotro
[4:48:09] ColdChillXI: tcpWow
[4:48:10] MrGattz: old and i just woke up FeelsBadMan
[4:48:10] Ezekyler: a lot of people requested Elder Scrolls to be multiplayer
[4:48:14] akulan: @Towelliee Star trek online too. The trekies won't let it die
[4:48:23] swampt1l: hey mrgattz
[4:48:27] LorienV: God I remember playing those mmos day 1
[4:48:28] DocsMistake: FF14 is 10 as well this year
[4:48:29] idenkaz_: swtor even had their biggest year in 2020
[4:48:31] LorienV: Im fucking old
[4:48:35] MrGattz: @SwapT1_ towHi
[4:48:41] CrusaderNero: fuck its 10 years since wow was gonna die Kappa
[4:48:47] swampt1l: how are ya man @MrGattz
[4:48:54] Jakosin: And it went on steam
[4:48:54] DocsMistake: new expac later this year for FF14 marks its 10 year anniversary
[4:49:00] Jakosin: So people knew it existed
[4:49:19] DocsMistake: that is very fair, 1.0 was a dumpster fire
[4:49:35] swampt1l: Yeah the original ff14 was a dumpster fire
[4:49:50] Jawis: true, ff14 original was really bad

[4:49:54] Pgang31: what about FF11 though?
[4:49:56] thecynicalshuffler: birth of the copy pasta meme
[4:49:59] johnzohead: bioware are on there last legs right now with dragon age 4.
[4:50:13] ZIKERZ: bio ware still got it going on
[4:50:15] swampt1l: Square enix lost so much money from ff14 orignal
[4:50:30] MrGattz: @SwapT1_ tired. im running on like 6 hours of sleep between the last 2 days and daylight savings didnt help lol. hbu?
[4:50:37] swampt1l: i dont think theyll be around much longer @ZIKERZ
[4:50:38] akulan: yup i am playing everquest right now lol
[4:50:51] Dalsonson: So, explain what Elder Scrolls is, I genuinely don’t know what it’s supposed to be Towel
[4:50:57] swampt1l: @MrGattz not bad either,just working and collecting money,the usual stuff
[4:50:57] CrusaderNero: I play every MMO more or less solo, so ESO sort of fits that
[4:51:03] mikejames01: E Q is still doing ex pacs they just put one out a bit a go
[4:51:06] LorienV: Man FF11 had the best community bar nun
[4:51:08] SSD511_: My problem is I can’t play other mmo hardcore because the achievements and progress I make in wow
[4:51:14] TanaseOS: Gonna play the new 14 xpac @towelliee ?
[4:51:21] swampt1l: If Dragon age 4 doesnt do well,i think its rip for Bioware tbh
[4:51:31] ZIKERZ: i am  the new ffxiv im not reayd for it
[4:51:34] MrGattz: @Dalsonson id love to live under your rock
[4:51:40] snoo_32: i notice if an mmo wants to do good, it needs to use healer tank dps trinity and not custom builds combat style. The holy trinity keeps games strong
[4:51:45] DocsMistake: got a case of that good old sunk cost fallacy
[4:51:55] SSD511_: Yes
[4:51:59] Coldlight1: not wrong
[4:52:20] Clicklesly: It's not like major WoW patches are around the same times as MMO launch Kappa
[4:52:31] saltymike: itmejpPRAISE itmejpPRAISE itmejpPRAISE preach
[4:52:34] MrGattz: @Dalsonson also if you actually dont know, its a single player RPG set in medieval times.
[4:53:02] Coldlight1: the struggle of being an mmo fan
[4:53:07] Ezekyler: it's hard to compete with 15 years of content
[4:53:08] GraaMee: Wildstar was so close to taking over
[4:53:11] Jarlan23: swtor came the closest for me
[4:53:14] ryurax: Well, obviously
[4:53:19] N3llee: wildstar fucked themselves.. there was 100's of pages of good solid feedback and they literally said no you guys are wrong
[4:53:25] SSD511_: I agree with you
[4:53:35] ryurax: Wod was still more played than eso right now, maybe even ff
[4:53:35] Coldlight1: my friends and i are hoping for ashes of creation, but yeah
[4:53:37] LorienV: The new Riot MMO will probably compete with Wow. Looking forward to it.
[4:53:39] Paramourn: sitting in the garrison simulator
[4:53:45] KaisenSiru: Draenor was fine.
[4:53:57] swampt1l: Riot games mmo lol ResidentSleeper
[4:53:58] MrGattz: @LorienV you say that but its 15 years behind wow in content.
[4:54:02] N3llee: WoD wasnt fine
[4:54:03] N3llee: lol
[4:54:09] N3llee: prob didnt even play it
[4:54:09] Misanth_66: I wish another game could touch my heart like wow, cause i feel like i'm spinning my wheels irl cause i still play after 16 years
[4:54:17] Dalsonson: Honestly, give me a Riot MMO
[4:54:27] ryurax: The worst wow expansion was still  doing better than all the others mmos
[4:54:34] SaraSyn: I stopped enjoying WoW during WoD, I started FFXIV and even then it took til the end of BFA to get me to fully quit WoW and go all in on FFXIV. Its hard to stop after so many years
[4:54:48] CrusaderNero: WoD sucked donkeyass. I was unsubbed most of it
[4:54:52] Mitune: I am really really hoping that Blizz will seriously look into the OSRS option for classic to woltk content. Add new stuff in the old style

[4:54:54] LorienV: @MrGattz I say that because its already established. League and LORT. For people who have played wow for 15 years have done the content already.
[4:54:54] MrGattz: i dont think its possible for anything to genuinely compete with wow at this point and thats why companies are not creating mmos left and right. they are to expensive to produce and at the end of the day everyone just goes back to wow.
[4:54:56] GraaMee: outside of raiding there wasnt much to do in WoD so you couyld play other games
[4:54:56] Ezekyler: Draenor was one of the best first weeks into an expansion, after that was an empty shell
[4:54:58] inteus82: @Misanth_66  how do you consider another game to have a chance after 16 years of work ? all new games are gonna be ground zero.
[4:55:10] snoo_32: i think riot knows not to get too close to the mmo market, as it's very risky. They are doing alright on f2p shooters and card games and mobas.
[4:55:16] ARmunkki: Guild Wars 2 is my 2nd mmo atm, no better for me out there.
[4:55:23] MrGattz: @LorienV yeah but thats not content. thats story. you can only read a book for so long
[4:55:27] ZillasaurusOG: I have high hopes for riot mmo
[4:55:51] conv3rge_: Man, I miss that janky ass H1Z1 game
[4:55:58] MrGattz: and no one has yet to actually do 100% of the content in wow
[4:56:01] LorienV: @MrGattz Riot is the only company that going to be able to compete with money.
[4:56:11] MrGattz: annie is the closest and shes only at like 98%
[4:56:12] xkennenx: @Nazarius tell me about it :)
[4:56:25] GraaMee: @MrGattz isnt there a few people with 100% of the ahieves?
[4:56:37] Dalsonson: And THEN THERES SHA
[4:56:42] 1godofwar0: @towelliee correct me if im wrong but no matter had bad an expac does eventually they have all had over 10 million subs in the launch window.
[4:57:01] MrGattz: @Graamee eh depends if you count the stuff that you cant actually do anymore cause the game changed so much of the years and removed content
[4:57:03] Littlehoodie16: leveling in classic is just so relaxing.
[4:57:09] N3llee: 10 mill.. someone is high as fuck
[4:57:09] Brainmanager: @MrGattz asmon showed one that completed all achiement not long ago
[4:57:09] Mitchendo64: so chat what classes are you boosting to 58?
[4:57:17] DocsMistake: Druid
[4:57:31] ryurax: Legion could have potentially been a 9/10
[4:57:32] Dalsonson: Not ALL launches, but they definitely spike @1godofwar0
[4:57:37] Jawis: I'm currently leveling my Shaman and going to boost a Priest FeelsGoodMan
[4:57:39] Jarlan23: i dont think wow is attracting lower age players anymore. you know 10-15 year olds arent playing WoW
[4:57:40] snoo_32: i am thinking of saving my boost, but in emergency, i'll do a warrior or a paladin.
[4:57:42] Funderik: 7mill is still insane for a "dying" "dead" "omg blizzard" mmo LUL
[4:57:47] Mitune: I wonder what the classic Wotlk numbers will be?
[4:57:49] Mitchendo64: cant wait for legion classic
[4:57:53] ryurax: If they made artifart power account wider or at least spec, and legendary system more like shadowlands
[4:58:00] SpicyFeta: the arrows
[4:58:04] GraaMee: right click his name?
[4:58:13] LunarVaporz: anyone want to tank a neroctiac weake 12
[4:58:13] tigzie: its /gleader name i think
[4:58:14] LunarVaporz: ?
[4:58:16] SpicyFeta: the arrows next to the rank
[4:58:18] LunarVaporz: horder
[4:58:20] SpicyFeta: right ther
[4:58:23] Jawis: try /glead name
[4:58:24] Ezekyler: guild control?
[4:58:31] Demanisraar: rank is there
[4:58:44] N3llee: doesnt look like your gm
[4:58:50] DocsMistake: demote yourself maybe?
[4:58:52] ryurax: Also, personally i would have split legion into 2 expansions, i mean we are literally taking down one of the biggest universe baddies, 1 part on azeroth the other on argus
[4:58:55] Lothrohan: relog
[4:58:59] kachhiga: /gleaer <name>
[4:59:03] TheGaoSora: LUL
[4:59:05] kachhiga: sometime add ons fuck it up
[4:59:11] Jawis: I think it's only /glead
[4:59:14] ryurax: This would have also given blizzard more time to develop argus
[4:59:17] Jarlan23: try promoting him to the highest rank then leave the guild urself.
[4:59:24] Jawis: weird
[4:59:26] LorienV: @MrGattz Plus Riot has the youth when it comes to gamers, you cant expect them to play and be first time MMO players. Im excited because its going to force blizzard to put more money into Wow or make something new.
[4:59:28] kachhiga: disable addons and then try /gleader <name>
[4:59:37] Ezekyler: Gattz not worthy of the Crown FeelsBadMan
[4:59:52] DocsMistake: yea you could make him the only officer and gquit then rejoin

[5:02:20] TheGaoSora: fairy dragons
[5:02:28] Jarlan23: dragonfly things
[5:02:33] chrslp: Yea theyre spread all around
[5:02:35] MrGattz: @LorienV im not gonna argue with the youth however i will say one thing. young people tend to have a very low attention span and want instant gratification for their actions. mmos are not usually fit for that type of person. but we'll see
[5:02:38] DocsMistake: those fucking faerie dragons mana burn and it is so annoying
[5:02:45] pepedeeee: sumRip
[5:02:55] TheGaoSora: PowerUpL PowerUpR

[5:03:20] pepedeeee: PowerUpL HyperTiger PowerUpR
[5:03:26] Jarlan23: As much as I loved BC i don't think I'll replay it much. The hardcore meta stuff kinda ruined Classic for me and that'll probably be even bigger in BC.
[5:03:30] MrGattz: they have the best chance
[5:03:31] TheGaoSora: and nothing original to show :)

[5:03:49] Coaltino: is riot releasing an MMO??
[5:03:58] N3llee: swtor is shit
[5:03:59] TheGaoSora: All of the money
[5:03:59] ryurax: More competition is better for the consumer
[5:04:00] N3llee: its dead
[5:04:08] snoo_32: riot also has ghost crawler and ghost crawler knows a lot about blizzard's weakness and strengths
[5:04:13] MrGattz: all the money
[5:04:16] staaff90: holy its so many adds on this stream
[5:04:18] Jarlan23: @N3llee yeah but it was big on release. EA put a lot of money behind it
[5:04:22] MrGattz: 500 people
[5:04:27] N3llee: and it failed
[5:04:31] Mitune: Well being owned by a Chinese Company does help with introducing it to the massive Chinese market
[5:04:44] BlueBeast33: They're probably saving the big money for that Lord of the Rings MMO
[5:04:48] DocsMistake: lets be real the current blizzard is almost unrecognizable from the one that Ghostcrawler worked for back in the day
[5:04:50] Dalsonson: It’s gonna be WWF vs WCW vs ECW all over again. Wrestling, but in gaming

[5:05:12] MammothGB: Tencent own so much stuff
[5:05:18] ColdChillXI: $kin$ for sure
[5:05:18] LorienV: @Towelliee Theyll have the users too, look at how many kids play League and Valorant.
[5:05:25] N3llee: funny how the same people bitch and moaned about ghostcrawler and now years later praise him like jesus
[5:05:36] JokaThS: how far is that game tho ? @Towelliee
[5:05:39] MammothGB: Win-Win for Tencent in that case
[5:05:48] swampt1l: pay 80 dollars for this new red dragon armor skin KEKW
[5:05:53] Dalsonson: INSIDER TRADING
[5:05:57] Mitune: only 3?
[5:06:05] Dalsonson: TENCENT JUST WANTS MONEY lmao
[5:06:10] 11RYN: 791B net worth for whoever wondered
[5:06:30] othraerir: they would have announced it when they knew it was 100% going ahead
[5:06:30] MrGattz: @N3llee idk if its the same people but i get your point. hes a pretty known name in this industry. idk if hes jesus worthy but.
[5:06:42] TheGaoSora: I mean, Riot got 3-4 leading mmos to learn the do and don't from, unless they go head on with the "like wow but better" mentality
[5:06:45] swampt1l: Tencent lost 62 billion$
[5:06:46] DocsMistake: I mean tencent is a company, the whole point of a business is to make money so the "they are only in it for the money" argument is bullshit
[5:06:49] MammothGB: @Quinnvvee and that's what is declared, I wouldn't be shocked if there was more hidden within china somewhere
[5:06:54] akulan: wow i didn't know tencent was worth that much
[5:07:07] ColdChillXI: Enough money to make a game flop and make another game LUL

[5:07:21] snoo_32: ghost crawler was the lead designer of Mist of pandaria for PvP and PvE systems
[5:07:25] LorienV: I loved Ghostcrawler, And I played a paladin lmao
[5:07:29] Supers18: Ion getting poached by ghost crawler to work on riot mmo Kappa
[5:07:34] Ezekyler: Ion even with his flaws he's a great Game Director, Ghostcrawler was a moron
[5:07:52] enux337: pays to be grumpy
[5:07:57] TheGaoSora: I love that kind of dev though... puts the crybabies in their place
[5:08:11] Gullebiffen1: LMAO
[5:08:17] Blistz1: i loved ghost crawler and i played a warrior
[5:08:17] MrGattz: on the toilet paper holder

[5:08:34] Dalsonson: 8% of their net worth, that’s ever $62B us for Tencent
[5:08:37] othraerir: hahah doing some reno's, oh shit, 62b just fell out of the wall
[5:08:40] MrGattz: oh man that video is solid gold worthy

[5:20:10] raebiii: hows valor bad?
[5:20:11] TheGaoSora: Just say: "the valor system in X felt much more rewarding then now" i think lol
[5:20:15] Lostme33: @Towelliee What are your thoughts on Ashes of Creation?
[5:20:29] PrisheBurningBlade: There is nothing I want more, than to use my coin, and get more AP... makes my weekly quest that much easier....
[5:20:44] PrisheBurningBlade: not even trolling
[5:20:50] DocsMistake: didnt they just push back the NDA window
[5:20:53] Mitchendo64: @towelliee what's a reroll token?
[5:21:15] mwchaos: it not going to 226 is a troll and the implementation of the currency and how you spend it is bad @gfuel_tmorg
[5:21:37] mwchaos: sorry, not how you spend, but the itemization that you spend valor on, is bad
[5:21:42] DocsMistake: @Mitchendo64 in previous expacs you used to be able to get an item that you could spend to get an extra chance at loot from a boss you killed in a raid or M+ Dungeon
[5:21:46] Mitune: Of the parts that are ready, do they seem compelling?  @Towelliee
[5:21:58] OigreSier: extra loot token?
[5:22:09] idenkaz_: the latest dev video showed me this game is not ready to be shown to the public at all im sorry.
[5:22:17] Valzark: A OMEGALUL C
[5:22:26] TheGaoSora: it also punishes casual players for playing the game at their own pace and only reward the hey keys runners and mythic raiders
[5:22:34] Mitchendo64: oooo bonus roll tokens are reroll tokens
[5:22:39] mwchaos: aoc is super ambitious, to a point, too much
[5:22:41] DocsMistake: yea
[5:22:51] ryurax: It;s good that the ashes devs decided to cut down on some of the more flamboyant animations
[5:22:52] PrisheBurningBlade: all wow needs to do, is scrap the old, and new engine, and every future mmo is dead
[5:22:52] Gizimoo86: chronicles of elyria looks way smoother OMEGALUL
[5:22:54] othraerir: the node system
[5:22:56] othraerir: ?
[5:22:58] Mitchendo64: never heard it call reroll tolens
[5:23:41] Gizimoo86: slow leveling is better if actual leveling content is good
[5:23:49] JoshStrobl: I think Ashes is going to end up being the Star Citizen of MMOs. Overly ambitious to a fault to the point it will never fully deliver on what it promises, always trying to reach perfection rather than gradually incrementing on systems.
[5:23:53] snoo_32: yea but maybe they introduce shop items to ...help you out right in leveling ?

[5:25:55] Red_Dead_Redeem: TBC is WoW's saving grace
[5:26:02] xendros78: I want to see the moment they realize their corruption system won't stop people from ganking others constantly and taking their stuff LUL
[5:26:04] ryurax: Wow 2 would be nice actually
[5:26:11] TheGaoSora: That's what she said..
[5:26:14] kokoki: Hopefully the leveling is compelling instead of time-gated rep grinds. Then, I don’t care if it takes a while.
[5:26:17] Mitchendo64: learn from cp2077. more hype = bad game
[5:26:22] Kromede: release the alpha 2023? Kappa
[5:26:24] Zuelase: You think we're getting a TBC Beta anouncement today? Seems like they did the same with Classic waiting 1 day before the anouncement on Tuesday
[5:26:24] gravess_66: amazon will be working on ashes and new lotr mmo at the same time
[5:26:29] Gizimoo86: yeah but if TBC beta/release is close hard to promote alpha
[5:26:34] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah more hype doesn't mean good game LUL
[5:26:37] nonstopdisco: i liked wildstar, miss it
[5:26:46] Lostme33: @Towelliee Did you get to play New World at all? It was a lot of fun for like 1 week and then we had nothing to do
[5:26:51] akulan: I miss wild star
[5:26:52] inszen: RIP Wildstar
[5:26:53] mwchaos: I miss wildstar, I thought for what it was it was extremely good
[5:27:02] Mitchendo64: damn wildstar sounds like a gen
[5:27:06] Mitchendo64: gem
[5:27:12] Mitune: getting flash backs to Guild Wars 2. That end game was atrocious at launch
[5:27:12] Red_Dead_Redeem: i mean look at Cyberpunk.....
[5:27:15] MammothGB: Preach towelliee
[5:27:27] TheGaoSora: I wonder if LP would get any heat if it fails..
[5:27:29] MammothGB: absolutely bang on
[5:27:35] kokoki: Totally agree man
[5:27:36] Maego1: e.g. No Man's Sky
[5:27:43] kirtyalex: 598 nice
[5:27:44] Red_Dead_Redeem: I agree with that statement
[5:27:45] xendros78: appointment gaming will be interesting as well if they stick to it, having major server events during specific time frames
[5:28:00] DallasEmbers: Hey Towelliee I can’t remember how was Enhancement shaman in TBC thinking bout rolling on your server.
[5:28:13] kirtyalex: yea it looks amazing
[5:28:17] kirtyalex: so far
[5:28:21] Bogzeh: the only job LUL
[5:28:26] Mitune: enhancement is good @Ryochi1337
[5:28:27] DocsMistake: I wanted so badly for Crowfall to be cool but it seemingly has vanished
[5:28:39] Mitchendo64: new world got shit ton of improvement since the preview too
[5:28:42] NickLeonhearth: Every1 i know refunded new world after 30 min of gameplay
[5:29:00] Lostme33: @Towelliee New World pvp was really lacking in variety of abilities to use
[5:29:01] signar101: @Towelliee did you try Age of Conan when it was released? It was gonna be the wow killer
[5:29:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah Conan the WoW killer LUL
[5:29:22] brravvoo: ashes ?
[5:29:37] TheGaoSora: Croman killed Conan Kappa
[5:29:49] Mitchendo64: @towelliee what would talk about during the days of zero viewers?
[5:30:05] Mitchendo64: what would you*
[5:30:10] Gizimoo86: @slendercarl  i played Conan was decent but quit like after 1 month just like most mmorpg than wow
[5:30:11] Sepron14: Do you think its possible for Wildstar to ever come back? or is it too late gone
[5:30:12] Lostme33: @Towelliee Im thinking that Ashes could really benefit from special events and rare spawn kills, things that encourage exploration that can replace typical leveling

[5:32:28] Red_Dead_Redeem: your reaction was priceless LUL
[5:32:31] xmedpakx: was such a great game
[5:32:58] mandalorianzz: WoW needs City of Heroes MMORPG customization options

[5:33:45] mikejames01: @snoo_32 there is one lol
[5:33:49] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: @Smashbrother I think it was a huge grind to get, not sure if rep based or what.
[5:33:49] metavahn231: if everyone is a jedi its meh kinda
[5:33:49] DocsMistake: or mage lords or whatever
[5:33:56] Mitchendo64: SWG with modern graphics
[5:34:02] obeysupreme76: Mario bros mmo is coming I feel
[5:34:05] metavahn231: no matter, both star wars games failed
[5:34:17] Mitchendo64: Swtor isnt a failure
[5:34:23] mikejames01: swtor did not fail
[5:34:30] Yagr6: did development time on classic take away from shadowlands?
[5:34:41] MrGattz: ehhh
[5:34:46] metavahn231: good one
[5:34:55] MrGattz: there is a lot wrong with EQ in terms of quality of life

[5:37:49] Gizimoo86: yeah going to play tbc more than shadowlands, got my druid to 60 2 days ago and paladin is also ready
[5:38:04] Mitune: I hope they are willing to add some new content to tbc. Just a little bit to test the waters
[5:38:06] SlayerLightStorm: I finally unlocked Layer 4 Torghast yesterday.
[5:38:08] griffdog125: no point in dailies if your max renown and have top conduits besides gold

[5:38:15] chamboyswag: beta is out
[5:38:17] chamboyswag: shut up
[5:39:07] neobug123: what do you think about the current state of prot paladin?
[5:39:45] niebvelungen: Pog
[5:39:46] Yagr6: @Towelliee im really looking forward to D4 im just unsure when it may release :(
[5:40:04] mandalorianzz: I'll be camping hellfire ramparts and mind controlling the opposing faction players off the cliff to their death
[5:40:22] Supers18: Towelliee sloot thinks prot pally is fine
[5:40:36] Deathu: Is it worth leveling a pala to play as a heal/dps in tbc vs just stickig with druid and healing with it ?  cause i knnow druid is "fixed" in tbc and is actualy good xD
[5:41:06] Samurai3434: Holy Paladin in the MDI now is blowing shit up as far as DPS now
[5:41:22] Noobish101: hunter was the most op class in TBC
[5:41:59] inktray: warrior + reprisal looks to me to be bis
[5:42:22] Raykersmaker: mr.towel u in beta now ?
[5:42:30] JNYB: really liking my prot warrior rn
[5:42:33] Copsonson: !cam
[5:42:33] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[5:42:53] DudeThatsDope: @Towelliee Im just wondering why youre playing TBC if you/aren't maxed out in retail already?
[5:43:10] metavahn231: are 5 mans relevant in tbc for very long? or do they die out pretty fast once raiding starts
[5:43:14] Raykersmaker: i mean 58 u ready to go my brutha
[5:43:17] propoopimus: it's awesome how blizzard re-releases old wow content so people can sub to classic for3 months/quit which helps fuel retail
[5:43:18] raebiii: i love playin my brew monk. I feel as un-touchable as DH
[5:43:31] toxi28: !TBC

[5:43:44] Noobish101: aoe threat was a bitch in tbc, probably pally is the best in that regard
[5:43:50] Mitune: Guess i gotta turn on a stream for a minute or two to get my spot Kappa
[5:43:56] metavahn231: come on guys, there's no azerite to farm in SL
[5:44:04] DudeThatsDope: @Towelliee word im 221 and i feel like there is nothing to do x
[5:44:15] metavahn231: anima is a joke
[5:44:22] raymond3195: warriors most boring class I ever played
[5:44:55] metavahn231: you are geting a taste of what FFXIV endgame is like, basically every expansion is SL, do your raids then play another game
[5:45:07] gravess_66: use that legendary in pvp as arms its like a 2nd die by the sword
[5:45:16] neobug123: paladin is great fun, but compared to my DH it just feels so bad and squishy. Expecially in m+
[5:45:32] hadesmoonX: no
[5:45:35] DudeThatsDope: its like when youre 220+ the game is over lol
[5:45:38] we_are_whomp: na
[5:45:41] metavahn231: sometimes they hiding around the castle
[5:45:42] hadesmoonX: its a badly designed quest
[5:45:43] we_are_whomp: shamans are just pretty low
[5:45:43] at1c: They are shared
[5:46:01] xBanosh: why do you stream without cam today?
[5:46:03] metavahn231: but xiv atleast has the story to go back to
[5:46:20] littano3: I found shamans have a higher spawn rate inside in the middle
[5:46:20] SlayerLightStorm: Lol @Towelliee Ony being cute. That silly dog.
[5:46:24] othraerir: some sort of black magic
[5:46:31] at1c: I had a pain doing this question while levelling my Warrior, bad RNG on Shaman spawns
[5:46:52] DudeThatsDope: valor points are a cheap way to get 220+ gear leveled up and id rather progress on mythic raid @Towelliee
[5:47:00] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:47:13] Mitune: Is this classic patch the one where they have removed spell batching @Towelliee
[5:47:30] SageRuskiy: Im enjoying the fuck out of doing keys
[5:47:37] TheCruelKing: is the Riot MMO going to be pvp centric? or have anything even been annouced yet?
[5:47:37] Demanisraar: yeah it's such a bs system lul
[5:47:40] SageRuskiy: I think If you like keys the valor system is fun
[5:47:41] Supers18: Towelliee but thats the grind?
[5:47:45] Supers18: grinding that piece of gear
[5:47:51] metavahn231: do they update AV in tbc any reason to do it?
[5:47:59] DudeThatsDope: if youre above 220 right now there is no need to grind
[5:48:02] feter9308: Thats why some choose the easy way, mythic raiding
[5:48:03] Clicklesly: To mirror the Conquest purchase/Honour upgrade they should give us the Valor purchase and Anima upgrades Kappa
[5:48:19] feter9308: get the high ilvl gear and then sit rest of expansion in orgrimmar.
[5:49:06] AureliusXV: playing classic is probably worse lol
[5:49:25] inktray: obv its beta, and better intended for 9.1
[5:49:28] metavahn231: gold farming on classic for tbc better than anima
[5:49:39] DudeThatsDope: @Towelliee agreed 200%
[5:49:42] raebiii: I dont think valor was intended to farm. I think it just makes gearing alts through m+ take less time
[5:49:44] niebvelungen: @Veramer boosting all day is the way
[5:49:48] hadesmoonX: None of my friends from bfa are even playing shadowlands anymore i think that says something
[5:49:55] Clicklesly: Vault also kinda make the Valor seem worse, imagine spending all Valor to upgrade an item to 220 and then get the 226 version in Vault ^^
[5:50:44] metavahn231: not a fan of vault, gear should come from the dungeon

[5:51:07] normysan: I do 10 keys on 3 characters each week to maximize my options.
[5:51:17] Samurai3434: In your opinion how long would it roughly the to level a character in Classic right now to 60?
[5:51:18] normysan: Starting to feel it.
[5:51:39] Gizimoo86: yeah some classic leveling is fine but some classes are slow but feral is fast
[5:51:48] neobug123: what class are you planning to play in tbc?
[5:51:49] notemneiher: I mean I have 220.50 ilvl, got ksm and aotc before patch, could upgrade like 6 items from 213 to 220 but the grind to get the upgradeable versions and Valor for them is not worth it, if it were 226,maybe,but as it stands right now, no way
[5:52:07] indiana__cones: Shadowlands is so far, a bad expansion. And thats not just a personal opinion. Torghast was a huge flop, people hate the maw, convenant/conduits are just another borrowed power system that no one actually wants, and anima has nothing about it to drive people to farm it.
[5:52:11] IverCold: @Samurai3434 120-200hours, depends on some factors
[5:52:12] GoeglerenDK: if you are new @Samurai3434 it will take quite some time, maybe 5-6 hours a day for 25+ days
[5:52:25] IverCold: at least 120 hours
[5:52:41] GoeglerenDK: and ye are so class depending, and server depending
[5:52:43] Blas0n: @indianacones2111 I disagree for raiders and M+ its the best expansion ever made
[5:52:45] niebvelungen: @indianacones2111 do you have AoTc and KSM?
[5:52:48] invictusseu: yea i lvled every class to 60 in classic feral was fat but gets a bit squishy in the 50s
[5:52:55] ArtCrisis: i quit wow early feb, not much changed i guess? KEKW
[5:52:57] invictusseu: fast*
[5:53:04] EmDuBB13: @niebvelungen no way he does
[5:53:07] Gizimoo86: i bougt the 60 epic cenarion belt for my druid was pnly 25g on AH
[5:53:42] EmDuBB13: I agree even tho I personally like torghast, and almost have KSM, already have AOTC etc

[5:53:58] metavahn231: WoW is literally XIV right now lol
[5:54:01] NickLeonhearth: 1 raid cant save an expansion, but they know whats wrong with the game....so hopefully they fix it in 9.1
[5:54:04] niebvelungen: @emdubb13 yeah just wannted to give him the benefit of the doubt
[5:54:06] Godrick85: Mythic dungs are amazing
[5:54:08] metavahn231: cool story, nothing to do
[5:54:12] indiana__cones: Well yeh, if you heavy push m+ and mythic raid, Shadowlands is great. The lead game designer is a raid logger, ofcourse alot of focus goes into raids, and it shows
[5:54:16] DudeThatsDope: unless youre mythic raiding you arent playong the game
[5:54:19] IverCold: @contentstarvedgamer and it was mage with perfect AoE farming
[5:54:20] danimoto10: I reameber you talking about SL in the beta saying it will either go two ways, you were optimistic but it seems like they went the shit way
[5:54:22] othraerir: sauron?
[5:54:29] JokaThS: im here
[5:54:34] niebvelungen: @emdubb13 Yeah AoTc and Ksm is the charm
[5:54:35] NickLeonhearth: We killed Sauron, it was awesome Kappa
[5:54:46] ryurax: I have a feeling that bfa story was like that mostly because they wanted to get rid of old gods before our character became even more powerful
[5:54:47] Simmo_rs: WeSmart
[5:54:47] Sortsnak: atleast i can enjoy ur stream while skilling fishing on classic hallelujha CoolCat
[5:54:52] ryurax: Like in legion we dealt with a titan
[5:54:52] Quimby54: if GD was right, every xpack was bad and WoW died in that timeframe
[5:54:53] FalconBroadcasting: I mean, things WERE stacked against it. It came as part of 8.3 the patch I that made me stop playing BfA
[5:54:57] kordatier_1337: @Towelliee  when do the beta starts today?
[5:55:00] ryurax: And then we go back to old gods?
[5:55:12] SlayerLightStorm: Heh, N'zoth got an Azerite Kamehameha to the FACE!
[5:55:21] NickLeonhearth: I have mythic raid ilvl and I havent killed 1 mythic boss, am I not playing the game?
[5:55:34] legobind: yeah as a player that does not raid i ran out of stuff to do really fast

[5:55:41] indiana__cones: Valor points is simply a band-aid to a bullet wound at this point, but I'm optimistic, I hope in further content patches things turn around
[5:55:52] metavahn231: SL forced people to experience raiding because there was not much else to do
[5:55:54] fooxytv: Fooxytv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[5:55:55] Nasudor: Do you think the Kind of "slow" content release in both retail and classic is hurting the game?
[5:55:57] ryurax: No you got it wrong toweliee, you didn;t get the full context
[5:56:02] ryurax: Of what i was saying
[5:56:05] TiqerWoW: it sucks that we only had nzoth for 1 patch considering a lot of the players have been waiting for a nzoth expansion
[5:56:06] othraerir: xal'atath :)
[5:56:08] Demanisraar: My m+ just fell apart... I don't want to pug man it's ass :(
[5:56:09] DudeThatsDope: but even in a casual guild that is doing mythic raid i mean... ? @Towelliee

[5:57:00] legobind: i really really hope they dont do to tbc like they did to classic
[5:57:11] legobind: i want kinda hard raids
[5:57:31] mitchcavyy: i was stuck on shamans doing this one too, for like a gd half hour
[5:57:35] Punchspunchs: tbc beta tomorrow trust me
[5:57:41] Gizimoo86: going to do any dungeos? it really help my leveling did not run out of quests before 60
[5:57:51] JNYB: Loving the loot system right now think valor points was a great addition to a loot system that already makes you feel like gaining 10 ilvls  feels a lot stronger
[5:58:06] legobind: yeah
[5:58:24] metavahn231: probably just 2.4.3 with #nochanges

[5:58:52] MrTahmm: i guess quicker than bear
[5:58:53] Mitune: didnt they say they were also going to fix drums as well
[5:58:57] metavahn231: so it is hard raids?
[5:59:00] chrslp: my brothers dads friends cousins said he heard someone tell them it was tomorrow
[5:59:01] notemneiher: I still think that due to how kits were designed back then, a raid like today back then would have never been completed
[5:59:08] rosina_scarlett: @Veramer pre nerf raids
[5:59:08] mcdoublemcgee: Let’s start a petition
[5:59:10] mcdoublemcgee: No nerds
[5:59:13] tigzie: that seal change for paladins is good
[5:59:14] mcdoublemcgee: Nerfs*
[5:59:14] hadesmoonX: They should add duel spac
[5:59:19] snoo_32: man i could use a complete breakfest :) hope you get a good meal towellie and peeps
[5:59:20] toooldtoplay75: i want dual spec
[5:59:33] tigzie: i would love dual spec
[5:59:41] orthezuma: a.k.a. 5% will enter black temple
[5:59:47] legobind: and thats a good thing
[5:59:48] fooxytv: true
[5:59:49] metavahn231: people always saying sunwell hard AF
[5:59:52] NickLeonhearth: dual spec is a real possibility and it would be so nice to have
[5:59:55] metavahn231: i didnt raid tbc
[5:59:58] jasonx282: Hydross was pretty hard in the begining as I recall
[6:00:02] enux337: hard mode is getting the gear you want
[6:00:10] DudeThatsDope: its classic you fucking queens
[6:00:35] snoo_32: in TBC there is a lot of 5 boss raids like sunwell / TK / and grull's lair.
[6:00:41] Grawh1: I just can't belive that so many of you bitches actually think the Vannilla//BC shit is gonna be easy....gotta love ehn mages have to stop DPS for a sec to actually use Sheep
[6:00:49] CurlyFriass: muru was fucked up back then
[6:00:56] metavahn231: i think average guilds will break up
[6:01:06] CurlyFriass: for sure
[6:01:10] snoo_32: i mean boss raids with 5 tankable bosses at once
[6:01:21] we_are_whomp: well m'uru won't interupt casts with unstable energy
[6:01:27] legobind: yeah once aq came out and we one shot emps i just quit
[6:01:28] we_are_whomp: so the 1st change of him
[6:01:31] itsMick: Onslaught disbanded :(
[6:01:35] SlayerLightStorm: The simple answer: You may wipe a few times, but you'll get it eventually.
[6:01:39] dracer30: onslaught broke up
[6:02:00] Nasudor: Problem is people call Private Server bosses "hard" because their health or dmg is doubled.  Having every ability 1 shot you is bot hard, its just a dumm Mechanic.  the combination of dealing with several abilities is what makes a Boss hard. and that combination and how to deal wirh it is clean for 14 years.  So even the "unnerfed" bosses will be a pushover for a lot of folls
[6:02:09] xmedpakx: but they will farm hard all the raid prior to sunwell and literally overpower it and no all strats
[6:02:13] xmedpakx: know*
[6:02:28] CrusaderNero: fuckin muuru
[6:02:32] xmedpakx: same thing ppl thought classic was hard lol
[6:02:55] Yanoru: It will be still face-rolled.
[6:03:02] NickLeonhearth: I managed to kill only the 1st 2 bosses in SWP, we got stuck on Felmyst or w/e the name is
[6:03:03] DudeThatsDope: thats just replaying old content lol
[6:03:30] metavahn231: so its hard but people will just be experienced obv
[6:03:31] Grawh1: these classic servers are complete bullshit
[6:03:32] we_are_whomp: you can't brute force sunwell
[6:03:35] xmedpakx: naxx was hard in vanilla in the day
[6:03:38] we_are_whomp: you'll die destroyed
[6:03:41] xmedpakx: now its a joke
[6:03:41] we_are_whomp: get*

[6:04:21] Nasudor: you also have to remember that people did muru by splitting the raid. on pretty mich every private Server peopöe Stack like 8 warlocks and just seed down the waves ontop of the Boss
[6:04:22] snoo_32: ty for ads towellie, watching 2/2 with no block <3
[6:04:29] dazuul: Still have nightmares of Archimonde. One dude dying to the flames and the whole thing was over. For weeks
[6:04:30] Mitune: Id pay for that
[6:04:32] wulu0: i luv u towelliee
[6:04:33] matteus7s: I mean <SALAD BAKERS> will probably  clear it in 1 night and host a gdkp the next
[6:04:35] stjon13: it killed my guild in BC  couldn't keep enough Shamans for the fight
[6:04:38] ch1rpz: Naxx was hard when it first came out in Classic though
[6:04:40] Wavekingg: I never played TBC so im excited
[6:04:54] Red_Dead_Redeem: flash me? Kreygasm
[6:04:58] wulu0: yes
[6:05:00] metavahn231: just be a restro shaman and you can be as unknowledgable as you want Kappa
[6:05:01] Jawis: I just want to enjoy BC again, I don't care if I clear the raid in the first week or if it takes me 3-4 ID's . Eventually I'll get the gear I want
[6:05:06] fooxytv: I think the player base needs to admit the game wasn't difficult before we were just terrible and now the player base is a lot better now
[6:05:08] ch1rpz: I’m very excited. I chose to have fun instead of being a stick in the mud
[6:05:08] Gizimoo86: my casual classic guild barely cleared MC and after that broke up so it was true vanilla experience lol
[6:05:22] TempickTV: Took my guild like 3-4 weeks for kt kill

[6:06:10] snoo_32: one thing i remember from BC is both trash mobs and bosses like to spam ccs on you like stuns silences and gouges. They also kick and slow often.
[6:06:19] SlayerLightStorm: Haters gonna hate. Fuck the haters, they haters.
[6:06:27] kerberw: some guilds on my server didnt kill KT in 2 monhts KEKW
[6:06:32] ch1rpz: Truth Slayer!
[6:06:49] metavahn231: it was scuffed classic
[6:06:52] ch1rpz: I ply games to have some fun and escape from real life for a bit
[6:07:10] hachimaann: repair :)
[6:07:18] we_are_whomp: only a handful of horde guilds have cleared naxx
[6:07:20] SlayerLightStorm: Slayin' lies, one truth at a time. And if you can't handle the truth, then you a hater.
[6:07:23] we_are_whomp: i think 3-4
[6:07:25] we_are_whomp: total
[6:07:25] DudeThatsDope: @Towelliee 100%\
[6:07:29] Supers18: Towelliee is anything in bc going to be Mythic level difficulty in retail?
[6:07:30] Coaltino: ME
[6:07:31] we_are_whomp: here
[6:07:32] Coaltino: jk
[6:07:33] Gizimoo86: New classic will come after 10 years hehe
[6:07:49] zerocemeriss: most of the classic content wasnt tuned to 40 fully world buffed raiders
[6:07:50] Mitune: Id help if I could cause that shit sucked solo
[6:07:56] Shozlor: Chicken quest is a w hole lot of xp, if you do all 3 of them
[6:08:03] Nasudor: i think people again will overestimate boss strength.  the optinized lineups lile classic will deal with most bosses. brutallus DPS Check? wel just put in 8 hunters and kill hin 2min before enrage.  muru raid splitting? just put in 8 warlocks and perma seed all adds ontop of the boss
[6:08:09] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: What server is he on atm?
[6:08:13] Grawh1: It trully doesn't matter BC is gonna be cleared  and of farm wihtin 3 weeks,,,suck thatg classic nerds
[6:08:32] Lazugo: !tbc @Broviathan_of_the_Brocean

[6:08:37] metavahn231: but how many guilds will be that coordinated, we dont mean the super guilds
[6:08:39] ravenoushydra: most classic content has 0 mechanics up until twin emperors what nerfs could have even affected the raids LUL
[6:08:42] niebvelungen: Yeah Wb sucked
[6:08:45] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: @Lazugo ty
[6:08:49] Mitune: they might be going forward #somechanges
[6:08:50] FalconBroadcasting: Now you KNOW, people would've bitched about their "memories" being ruined.
[6:08:54] we_are_whomp: world buffs make guilds do t4/t5 lvl of dps in naxx
[6:08:55] zerocemeriss: even in top guilds if u lose world buffs the content becomes way harder
[6:08:59] we_are_whomp: its silly
[6:08:59] metavahn231: who gives a shit about super guilds they do it anyway
[6:09:13] henrikjuncker: henrikjuncker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months!

[6:09:38] DudeThatsDope: well then its not  vanilla
[6:09:58] KaisenSiru: esfandW
[6:09:59] Blas0n: @Towelliee Do you think they will add a Hardcore mode of classic?
[6:10:06] we_are_whomp: only a handful of guilds did that
[6:10:08] we_are_whomp: for loatheb
[6:10:10] we_are_whomp: and that's it
[6:10:13] ch1rpz: But the real question is why do people care about no changes? Just play the fucking game you fruits
[6:10:18] Mitune: I think people for a long time didnt even use pots regularly
[6:10:24] GKiDz: used ony head for sapph + KT
[6:10:26] we_are_whomp: and even then it wasn't a huge priority like it is now
[6:10:29] SlayerLightStorm: Literally, people finding something to fucking hate. Fuck the haters, like I said earlier @Towelliee
[6:10:32] legobind: yeah you got the ony buff like maybe once aday
[6:10:33] henrikjuncker: hey towelliee i cant remember leveling in TBC , im gonna go prot again, but i can figure out if im gonna level now in classic or wait, is there any difference
[6:10:40] zerocemeriss: yea it was the fact that u werent expected to 1shot bosses so buffing would have been a waste of time
[6:10:40] ChewyD999: World buffs is honestly the reason I stopped playing classic

[6:10:57] 1godofwar0: i agree with everything except id remove debuff limit so all spec can raid

[6:11:14] dracer30: Alot of blizz money been lost though, alot of people have multiple accounts to make getting world buffs easier
[6:11:18] dazuul: Thinks were a lot more chill in the past. Sure some elitists. But most played for playing a game not a loot generator
[6:11:24] slickyism: !TBC
[6:11:32] metavahn231: WRATH BABIES

[6:11:40] scruboinus: i started in bfa but i luv classic :)
[6:11:45] we_are_whomp: most probably didn't even start in wrath

[6:11:56] Gizimoo86: yeah private servers or was in kindergartern
[6:12:12] mcdoublemcgee: When I couldn’t afford the wow sub

[6:12:37] Mitune: oof
[6:12:38] Triist0ne: yikes
[6:12:38] snoo_32: tbh i was 16 when i played wow in 2004 i think, now i am 32 and it's 2021. Sorry if my math sucks. But yea ....
[6:12:45] Jawis: it was hard enough to get 40 people to play - imagine finding 40 of them even getting worldbuffs PepeClap
[6:12:51] Shozlor: No one would raid in wow, if that was a thing
[6:12:53] DudeThatsDope: its weird to play a game youve already beat and have knowledge on
[6:12:56] Zansteh: planning his next scheme
[6:12:58] Mitune: Shadowlands too balanced Kappa
[6:13:00] we_are_whomp: yeah nothing like having content tuned for 40 people for 20 man raids bc of world buffs
[6:13:17] WarmEagle: Im just waiting to enslave an aoe sb vw KEKW
[6:13:24] dazuul: I mean, one of the biggest bosses was the dancing in nax
[6:13:31] DankFarik: hes doing 10 pally rbgs
[6:13:36] enux337: prob messing with conduits for oneshots etc
[6:14:01] rosendoagz: Hello everyone, I hope everyone's having a bless day.
[6:14:12] ryurax: Conduits are just not powerful enough
[6:14:20] fooxytv: he's trying to use the torghaust buffs out in the world

[6:21:34] zoobu2: the macro is for pve dps lol i dont think a hunter can climb in arenas spamming steady shot +kill command
[6:22:27] legobind: pvp its all about warrior and rogues with maces
[6:22:28] sassquack12: what addon is that for the fonts??
[6:22:35] Demented7: Pve certain dps classes can just macro it to wheel button and spin to win not in pvp
[6:23:13] Zansteh: the one u just did, nvm
[6:24:03] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: @Towelliee You mentioned character boosts earlier, are they letting people boost a character for TBC Classic?
[6:24:19] Bieflapjes: moring everyone
[6:24:27] snoo_32: towellie is it possible to boost a horde  character while also having a 70 alliance on the same server ?
[6:24:49] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: Awesome, thanks for the answer.
[6:24:51] sassquack12: cant boost pally or shaman tho
[6:24:58] TopherWinsTV: @snoo_32 only on a PvE server
[6:25:06] snoo_32: ok
[6:25:11] Bieflapjes: Just entered, but what you mean with TBC beta in teh Queue? You mean in the launcher?
[6:25:33] Gizimoo86: yeah i think its 30 % faster to level
[6:25:34] beckett3a: there are hundreds of peeps leveling on the more populated server right now, i'm sure the same will be once belves are live
[6:25:39] sassquack12: dunno if i should boost warrior priest or rogue
[6:25:47] SageRuskiy: Azuremyst and BloodMyst are visually amazing, gameplay wise though, fuck me its so bad

[6:29:24] QuantumDelta: it's more like wow classic in leveling I guess lol
[6:29:38] Jawis: I love the Final Fantasy story more than WoW's, but I couldn't be arsed to read/listen to it
[6:29:53] Deadelus0: lol
[6:30:17] hunni_milk: I feel you, Shadowbringers story was insane
[6:30:22] josh8555: they are making a new expansion called end Walker
[6:30:24] Askinas: Do you have the TBC beta in your launcher?
[6:30:30] metavahn231: i had that feeling haha
[6:30:46] metavahn231: they need to save some of that shit for the patches
[6:31:02] PlaguedV: oh ur prob gonna get even more cutscenes for endwalker because its a standalone story from 80-90 KEKWDISCO
[6:31:07] Askinas: Nice bro!
[6:31:21] QuantumDelta: I guess the cutscene madness was because 'the first' was a new world
[6:31:21] hunni_milk: Towelliee - I took a huge break on ff, so I had to skip all the shadowbringers cutscenes and then re-watch everything at the end via the inn
[6:31:23] zoobu2: shadowbrings had  an amazing story but it took away any mmo feel of the game until you actually get to max lvl and get to play lol. leveling was just a movie
[6:31:24] hunni_milk: It fucking sucked
[6:31:41] Coaltino: WIL YOU BE ABLE TO BOOST DRAENEIS??
[6:31:45] Murphybrown: just the slow old english style
[6:31:48] josh8555: yea the fact they force you to sit through ALL of it I stopped at like 78 lol
[6:31:55] metavahn231: you saw the best part, the parts with the fat guy
[6:32:13] metavahn231: now its just keel the bad guys
[6:32:23] Xanigh: i tried to get to final fantasy xiv, but i got to the second expansion and it just got a bit boring and i noticed i didint log in anymore. i still wanna play it but i just need to get thru the leveling i guess
[6:32:31] QuantumDelta: you can watch the cutscenes back in game too if there is no video (..though I'd be surprised if there wasn't one)
[6:32:37] Lynwer: is this already tbc beta? cant be right?
[6:32:44] UthredTV: what addon is that?
[6:32:53] chrslp: robot chicken quest FeelsGoodMan
[6:32:59] chrslp: Questie im pretty sure
[6:33:00] hunni_milk: Nah this isn't tbc beta
[6:33:09] UthredTV: @chrslp TY!
[6:33:10] hunni_milk: Certain of it
[6:33:56] DreavT2K: 1 thing wow does right, it doesnt kill us with story and they understand we just wanne kill shit

[6:34:41] hunni_milk: everything about ffxiv is slower though, not just the cutscenes but I mean the globals are 2.5 seconds...
[6:34:58] hunni_milk: I contrast, it is just a massively slower paced game, don't try play it fast
[6:35:01] QuantumDelta: 2.5 globals but 20 off global abilities LUL
[6:35:28] SageRuskiy: I find retail post GCD change to be a slow game

[6:37:47] BobithanTG: Sure, but speaking entirely about the waves that spawn during escort
[6:37:58] havenbirch: Yeah, FFXIV is a very story heavy game, so you have to have the capacity to sit through it and try to get immersed in the story, but not everyone can do that, the RPG element is very prominent in that game compared to WoW that is more gameplay heavy
[6:38:17] hunni_milk: It really is
[6:38:25] Blas0n: Does FFXIV have raiding?
[6:38:27] inktray: SL is pretty fucken slow
[6:38:37] hunni_milk: 2.5 second globals and casting animations / animation locks are super slow
[6:38:50] xmedpakx: ff14 end game raiding is fun
[6:38:50] SageRuskiy: Compared to FF?
[6:38:52] SageRuskiy: KEKW
[6:38:53] inktray: go look at apm on logs
[6:38:53] DreavT2K: its so slow i even struglle with controller on ps4, once your acustamnd to conrtoller you get automaticly faster
[6:38:56] inktray: its slow
[6:39:01] MrGattz: FailFish
[6:39:02] hunni_milk: SL arena is some of the fastest we've seen since TBC - wow is fast :)...
[6:39:16] KaisenSiru: ?????
[6:39:18] Seerated: Got so damn much to do in SL I actually kinda don't do anything, overwhelmed. Mainly due to many alts though
[6:39:25] N00bondrugs: even destro is faster than any FF class
[6:39:28] CeeGee93: hardcast pyro Pog
[6:39:31] PvtHudson093: PvtHudson093 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 62 months! Kyrian rocks
[6:39:34] metavahn231: some of the classes are faster because of their ogcds
[6:39:41] xmedpakx: end game FF 14 is glamour
[6:39:44] xmedpakx: lol
[6:39:46] PadidinJones: theyre heeeeere
[6:39:47] kjayy21: kjayy21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! morning everyone
[6:39:48] at1c: People die in like 2-3 globals in WoW currently.  not even remotely same as ff14
[6:40:06] DreavT2K: end game ff14 is to be as sexy as possible
[6:40:07] inktray: i guess, your picking and choosing your debate
[6:40:12] zoobu2: is this kara music?
[6:40:13] Virus2508: so if i have "shadowlands beta" showing in my launcher i actually got invited to TBC beta? @Towelliee
[6:40:15] QuantumDelta: ehh you say that but plenty of tanks die in a global or 2 if they're hard pulling dungeons ;p
[6:40:16] inktray: on one hand your comparing apm
[6:40:22] inktray: on the other your comparing time to kill
[6:40:24] SageRuskiy: You literally blanket stated WOW is slower APM than FF @inktray
[6:40:28] SageRuskiy: DOnt backpeddle now
[6:40:33] inktray: all apm is slow on wow
[6:40:36] inktray: in pvp and pve
[6:40:37] QuantumDelta: savage and unreal difficulty in ffxiv too...
[6:40:39] othraerir: you're right though
[6:40:42] Scoodles91: its just faster if you are skinner
[6:40:51] metavahn231: WoW needs more ogcds to be fast
[6:41:03] SageRuskiy: I think MOP was peak wow abilities
[6:41:03] Chilled_Lemon: yo
[6:41:07] inktray: enf of bfa apm was super high
[6:41:16] SageRuskiy: Cause you had plenty of shit ogcds
[6:41:23] SinicalDev: I tried FFXIV but couldnt get into the whole silent cutscene thing
[6:41:28] Chilled_Lemon: Hi
[6:41:31] DeanoTV: FF is slow af
[6:41:34] DeanoTV: no way
[6:41:38] TheGaoSora: nope
[6:41:38] mwchaos: no
[6:41:41] Drogdorf: nothing is
[6:41:42] KPable: no
[6:41:43] SageRuskiy: No
[6:41:43] shurno: no
[6:41:44] PlaguedV: ff is slow af KEKW
[6:41:45] hunni_milk: FF is slooooow AF
[6:41:46] havenbirch: No
[6:41:56] flebbooo: oh god no LUL
[6:41:58] Bogzeh: ff isnt that slow at max lvl
[6:42:01] xmedpakx: no of course now, wow is a faster played combat
[6:42:02] hunni_milk: Have you ever tried warfronts in FF? Hahaha
[6:42:07] xmedpakx: not*
[6:42:09] inktray: uhhh depends, those ultima fights look pretty intense.
[6:42:17] metavahn231: some of the melee classes def have more apm
[6:42:21] SinicalDev: who the fuck cares about APM in an MMO lmao
[6:42:24] Chuck108: yes
[6:42:24] Triist0ne: chicken escort ye
[6:42:27] xmedpakx: ultimate is fast
[6:42:27] QuantumDelta: healers too Veramer
[6:42:37] TanaseOS: All the slow AF responses for XIV probably never went past level 20 or something
[6:42:38] inktray: im not trolling
[6:42:39] PlaguedV: ultimate fights are indeed alot more fast paced immo
[6:42:41] inktray: go do them
[6:42:43] kalmenus1: I’m currently playing FFXIV and have played both regularly and the answer is no. Even not doing the story to level this xpac is painfully slow
[6:42:45] xmedpakx: but the actual gameplay is slower
[6:42:46] SageRuskiy: I care about APM @SinicalDev Im bored if im not clicking abilities fast enough
[6:42:46] hunni_milk: The fights are mechanically interesting in FF > but they don't require high apm or even much focus tbh
[6:42:47] secondarych: stop it right there troll scum
[6:42:54] flebbooo: LUL
[6:42:57] inktray: i havnt done them, i have played alot of wow in SL
[6:43:03] Chuck108: there's a clearing up ahead
[6:43:09] we_are_whomp: its before the 2nd cave
[6:43:12] SageRuskiy: Honestly 8.3 was really fun because of high APM KEKW
[6:43:13] we_are_whomp: you'll see it shortly
[6:43:18] QuantumDelta: top end FF content is pretty comparable to M+, wow's done a pretty good job of catching up last couple of expansions in that regard
[6:43:32] xmedpakx: not the story or questing , he means is the reaction time to play your toon faster etc
[6:43:42] xmedpakx: wow is much faster
[6:44:02] Chuck108: it goes back the way you came
[6:44:07] QuantumDelta: the robot does agro some stuff
[6:44:15] metavahn231: XIV raids are like 15 minute long mechanic roulletes
[6:44:17] Seerated: No, robot moves out the way you came. There will be surprise-attacks though so better to not have that many regular respawns
[6:44:20] hunni_milk: For people who don't know, you HAVE to opt in for the classic beta on battle-net site, you don't just get it :' )
[6:44:49] Drogdorf: upgrade from quest PogChamp
[6:44:56] feherlofia123: isnt ff14 intentionally slow to have console players have a fair shot at playing the game
[6:45:04] flebbooo: what do people mean with high Apm in 8.3? u mean cause of extra essences abilities etc, cause imo it just felt more clunky. Especailly with so many things on the gcd at the time
[6:45:04] havenbirch: FFXIV is very slow definitely, but I don't personally mind the pace, it gives me that extra time to think about what ability to use next
[6:45:16] derElten: gunsword?

[6:45:34] Supers18: ghost
[6:45:38] metavahn231: FFXIV is faster but you can choose a slower class if you want
[6:45:54] inktray: they arent talking about speed
[6:45:57] AureliusXV: already gotthe bet afor tbc when it first came out
[6:46:11] inktray: its obv they think moving left and right = how fast it is
[6:46:36] hunni_milk: Too many people died on titan HM and think ffxiv is "fast"
[6:46:46] Drogdorf: monkaS
[6:47:00] Seerated: Yup, it's over if too far
[6:47:00] inktray: and twin tania
[6:47:01] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:47:01] metavahn231: if you mean does the boss just instantly kill you with no warning, yea i guess WoW is faster that way
[6:47:11] shurno: or if an ally go pvp and kill it to be mean
[6:47:29] inktray: we already talked about apm/ and they didnt mean apm
[6:47:33] hunni_milk: You die instantly in ffxiv a lot too, it's just less punishing because you can always comabt rez
[6:47:47] hunni_milk: Combat rez* There is no limit to rezzing people in combat
[6:48:02] we_are_whomp: should be 3 sets of mobs
[6:48:03] QuantumDelta: in the casual content yes
[6:48:04] Alaquane: the limit is healer mana
[6:48:06] we_are_whomp: if i remember right
[6:48:11] Worstmuffin: i dont think its that far
[6:48:15] Armdel: Darnassus BibleThump
[6:48:18] metavahn231: most things in xiv are just very telegraphed and clear
[6:48:19] QuantumDelta: in non-casual ffxiv content you can't combat res, 1 death = it's a wipe :P
[6:48:24] inktray: i think the debuff on dps = restarts cause you cant make the hard dps checks
[6:48:32] Alaquane: never tried savage
[6:48:52] xmedpakx: savage is easy
[6:49:02] hunni_milk: Pretty much
[6:49:18] xmedpakx: lol  uh tried ultimate
[6:49:24] hunni_milk: There's almost always an intermission AoE between phases, and you just need to be able to soak it
[6:49:29] xmedpakx: one shot you  if you mess up
[6:49:32] hunni_milk: and the other mechanics are dodge or die
[6:49:45] Yagr6: i wish they would dial back the mechanics a touch
[6:49:47] xmedpakx: ultimate will own you
[6:49:55] metavahn231: the mechanics in WoW are very simple, just punishing
[6:49:56] Jakosin: ff14 raiding you use to need to socket vitality to survive mechanics
[6:50:02] Jakosin: they did away with that tho
[6:50:07] Blas0n: @Veramer umm have you done mythic xy'mox?
[6:50:12] hunni_milk: @Towelliee  Thorns :P
[6:50:18] Blas0n: @Towelliee I love Mythic Lady inerva for tanking its so cool man!
[6:50:36] QuantumDelta: nah, no carry in the top end stuff
[6:50:38] flebbooo: currently progressing on mythic sludgefist and the amount of things that need to go right, is quiet intenese
[6:50:47] xmedpakx: no you cannnot carry
[6:50:49] inktray: i think the 8 ppl makes it easier
[6:50:51] bodli1125: you pro cant carry in top stuff wher you have dps checks and all thath shit
[6:50:52] secondarych: catJAM
[6:50:56] Jakosin: when people sell clears they just use their accounts most cant be done with 7 people
[6:50:57] QuantumDelta: if all 8 don't know exactly what they're doing it's gg
[6:51:00] hunni_milk: In normal content you can, but ins avage etc no

[6:51:23] xmedpakx: savages is not top end
[6:51:25] hunni_milk: We used to sell turn 9 and turn 13 clears back in ARR and we'd just 7 man it
[6:51:26] Virus2508: who wants to play a melee anyways Kappa
[6:51:28] Alaquane: booty bay
[6:51:28] xmedpakx: ultimate is
[6:51:33] othraerir: booty bay
[6:51:38] xmedpakx: savage can be pugged
[6:51:39] hunni_milk: But a lot has changed you can't really do that for end game now
[6:51:49] xmedpakx: ultimate is insane
[6:51:51] metavahn231: xiv is just another level, in ultimate you had to fail certain mechanics too pass a mechanic later
[6:51:56] we_are_whomp: make sure to do the other 2 if you can also
[6:52:03] flebbooo: well.. our setup has 6 melees so it’s even worse LUL i wouldn’t be suprised if we see a few benched on wendesday
[6:52:10] MuttonChopins: arent they adding a new difficulty for Endwalker?
[6:52:11] Supers18: you pugging sludgefist Towelliee LULW
[6:52:12] we_are_whomp: final quest is like 8400 xp
[6:52:18] hunni_milk: I haven't legit raided since ARR
[6:52:27] Chuck108: if you do the other 2 chicken escorts first you can turn in all 3 at once then turn in the another quest right away after
[6:52:28] QuantumDelta: yeah you can't raid 2 mmos
[6:52:53] Virus2508: oh god
[6:53:04] QuantumDelta: it's literally 2 full time jobs at that point lol
[6:53:37] Alaquane: is there an alliance raid (24m) in shadowbringers?
[6:53:43] Chuck108: hinterlands
[6:53:45] othraerir: hinterlands
[6:53:46] we_are_whomp: hinterlands
[6:53:49] spankymcpie: i loved watching rag handing your ass over to you
[6:54:15] stjon13: I wish star wars wasn't sooo bugy at launch, and they had used a diff engine, I wanted that game to to be good
[6:54:31] inktray: hell yeah hutt ball was hella fun
[6:54:34] QuantumDelta: yeah Alaquane but the 24mans are kinda casual content in ffxiv
[6:54:41] inktray: except the operators fucked me in a stun
[6:54:41] QuantumDelta: pretty much always have been
[6:55:09] Alaquane: I've never done one when they were current content
[6:55:32] azzacopey: classic looks like a lot of walking!
[6:55:45] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: I hope I can get into raiding for TBC Classic. I miss that shit.
[6:55:45] metavahn231: 24 mans are just for funsies
[6:55:54] xmedpakx: i farmed savage alexander for mounts heh
[6:55:54] QuantumDelta: Dun Scaiths last 24man was pretty tricky when it was current LUL

[6:58:26] Alaquane: I think it's for mangle in BC
[6:58:32] QuantumDelta: it's horrendously RNG
[6:58:37] Wiecing: it cost 0 energy
[6:58:41] joker2880: It's just energy cost
[6:58:43] QuantumDelta: but you could spend the entire fight just hitting the same ability
