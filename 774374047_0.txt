[1:37:29] eiskecks: yeah Nort america finals guys !!!!!!!
[1:37:32] RiotdogTV: HYB outplayed them on top of having the comp advantage too.
[1:37:52] mnowpsn: i thought VC was like the best team ever and never ever lost on a private server but in these tournies theyve already lost a few times
[1:37:54] regulater45: both teams can run shamans though
[1:38:00] ShadowswiftyLol: yeah its too horde favorred!!! should be tournament in av instead!

[1:38:16] DanieldOrs: That recap before from Dooky was embarassing for Lions team XD
[1:38:17] greasemags: To beat the iron triangle, you set up in between all three nodes, fake BS so LM defenders drop down, then assault LM while snaring the road up to LM

[1:39:45] stsk1290: @curbcheck almost all teams were alliance and apes was basically undefeated
[1:39:46] eiskecks: vanill,a ist much faster i think but i like classiv pvp its like the first pvp we all play in our hauses with ourt parents
[1:39:47] regulater45: ally can use shamans too right
[1:39:53] mnowpsn: @Baemare oh okay just learning classic, and we? u part of team I like to learn these things im cheering on vc here though
