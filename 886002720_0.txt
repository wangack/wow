[2:55:01] kdogg3000twitch: Everytime I do world quests the ilvl is lower than what I already have
[2:55:02] Djulio: @Towelliee what do you think about this idea about M+: put a vendor at the end of a completed dungeon, which has all the loot that could drop in the dungeon, scaled to ilvl depending on the key done, tradable for valor/some other currency
[2:55:21] Thehavok2: im sure they are waiting till blizzcon
[2:55:37] TheSpace_Sloth: TheSpace_Sloth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[2:55:39] Thehavok2: February 19-20
[2:55:58] Gorestack: probably prepping .1 patch and all major changes will wait until then
[2:56:27] sussyrev: Fuck pve vendors. The amount of community crying is getting annoying.
[2:56:30] Seviander: Hey Towelliee, do you have a hard time reaching even 20% haste on your paladin?
[2:56:43] sinlesssinner: blizzconline they ll announce the patch, PTR the monday after the con. 4weeks later, patch is out!
[2:56:54] TheSpace_Sloth: @Revanite20 so you want them to keep crying instead of blizzard improving the game?
[2:57:05] Meakis: Valor and Justice points
[2:57:06] sinlesssinner: as for pve, they ll just copy the pvp system right now, valor badges is coming back
[2:57:11] Meakis: The shit was good in Wotlk and cata
[2:57:17] Stawnchy: Emblems of Frost
[2:57:17] CritcobainTV: @Revanite20 I mean, it makes sense tho, people shouldn't be forced to gear in pvp if they dont like pvp
[2:57:17] Dalsonson: Even 213 gear would be too much bc you can’t acquire it normally
[2:57:33] iGoatx: hi towelliee
[2:57:39] Contractual_: it'd massively increase the amount of loot we get and people would get bored faster. That's the downside.
[2:57:42] iGoatx: what is the stat addon top left?
[2:57:46] Dalsonson: So, do they raise the ilvl from dungeons so 213 makes sense?
[2:57:48] scars_____: tokens are great, why not valor
[2:58:01] Dayszen: what do you mean we have time walking points to get great gear
[2:58:06] sussyrev: I mean yeah, they should improve the pve loot system. Just a boring ass valor system is not the answer.
[2:58:07] Meakis: Valor & justice points were relevant for high geared player because you could sell the mats, BoE's and more from the vendor. Wich means high geared players are still interested in a daily dungoen because of the reward it gives
[2:58:13] TheSpace_Sloth: @Revanite20 Some people only like pvp some people only like pve why not reward both instead of forcing people do something they have no interest in
[2:58:56] TheSpace_Sloth: i say reverse all the changes and just be done with it
[2:58:59] scars_____: true
[2:59:01] Meakis: You can save up justice points from raids, daily dungoen and so on to get some targeted upgrades of a vendor, so you still have a daily progression
[2:59:01] Thehavok2: hey @Towelliee did you watch the Poirier - McGregor fight? Pretty quick finish
[2:59:07] PadidinJones: @Towelliee but Blizz will never let us have our cake and eat it though
[2:59:12] esceti95: i think vendors would be best option
[2:59:35] Contractual_: I think if people think there aren't downsides to every option they haven't fully thought it through from a game systems POV.
[2:59:36] scars_____: man BC and woltk were great bcz of that
[2:59:48] Djulio: which is where my idea shines :D
[2:59:58] Moronil: I love the planning mentality we had with titan residuum
[3:00:08] Djulio: since the vendor would contain just that dungeon's loot
[3:00:24] Cartharon: i think valor would be a great answer
[3:00:26] TheSpace_Sloth: Want loot to feel more satisfying? dont give my level 12 an epic from a quest
[3:00:48] hapsthehamster: they are going to make it so when u dont get any loot u get a mail saying sorry for the lack of loot, come back next exp :)

[3:00:52] Meakis: what TheSpace_Sloth is saying yeh
[3:00:53] givmeafrekinname: @Tuomas_Emissary the problem with that system in SL is actually getting gear to drop to convert it though
[3:00:54] sussyrev: Or they keep the current sytem and maybe tweak the drop rates as bit. Without giving us another system. I remember when „let loot be loot“ was loved by the community. tomatoReally
[3:00:56] lmtheboogie: I'm super casual so loot feels fine. Can someone who plays more tell me what the issue with loot is?
[3:00:56] ewigeslicht: corruption vendor 2.0 inc
[3:01:10] scars_____: cant wait for the patch, game is boring rn
[3:01:18] Meakis: no a lvl 12 character, like the epic needs to feel epic though.
[3:01:29] foxies_havocing: I think words like epic and legendary lost it's meaning. Getting an epic should be a wow factor, not standard, even legendaries are now standards
[3:01:35] ijuki: I have done like 7 m+... 35 anima PepeWhy
[3:01:37] thunderhawq: We need an extra system on top of the loot system, on top of the gearing system
[3:01:43] im_your_innerdemon: dont you think a vendor would be a "to" fast gearing and ppl would quit the game quicker cuz they have all they want? and have "nothing" to do?
[3:01:49] Meakis: Again, the Justice & Valor point system was perfect and self explanitory
[3:01:53] piratechris: Or just go play classic. Gives you just that
[3:01:55] TheSpace_Sloth: nah just literally a level 12 gets epic so epics dont mean anything neither do legendaries make that mean something instead of starving us of gear its not as easy as that of course but still
[3:02:00] Contractual_: But people are getting pretty much a guaranteed upgrade every week through the vault.
[3:02:01] Meakis: They are trying to re-invent the wheel
[3:02:03] LootFeverTV: midsentence ad xD
[3:02:11] Contractual_: Also, people get bored when they get good loot and leave - so it goes both ways.
[3:02:12] Meakis: Vendor system is just some reward tuning in currency
[3:02:25] Contractual_: It'd be faster than now.
[3:02:30] sussyrev: And yet everyone praised Blizz for removing TF crendorJaraxxus
[3:02:50] scars_____: ye but it was the only way to get high ilvl azerite gear
[3:02:54] Moronil: I like how FFXIV raiding gear works, even if you don't get an item from a boss, you get a currency to eventually buy the item
[3:03:09] Contractual_: I think you'd be a minority in loving BFA gearing.
[3:03:13] Revelations45: no upgrades here from the vault

[3:03:17] Jay_rb: I have so far, Guess I'm lucky

[3:03:39] Contractual_: There's a very high chance of getting an upgrade every week from the vault... unless you're nearly maxed out anyway
[3:03:41] crusadermagnus: pve just needs conquest
[3:03:41] Djulio: but why allow people who have not even entered a raid/dungeon at a specific level to get gear from it?
[3:03:46] Contractual_: you'd have to do no content
[3:04:10] ewigeslicht: got 3 225 staves all haste vers for a resto shaman. utter trash loot. but the vault isnt all bad gotten a few good peices
[3:04:13] Meakis: Investing that much time in wow tbh ... but i'm 215 on my main

[3:04:59] sussyrev: At the end of the day, vendors are boring. Dont make wow a Bellular spread sheet game. Thats my last cent in this convo. stripSip
[3:05:04] Doohzyy: im only 214 and i do everything but pvp.. the only upgrades i get are from vault
[3:05:13] Gorestack: mythic+ destroyed gearing just like greater rifts did in D3 and now they don't know what to do

[3:05:40] Fulguran: Man, i'm a very casual player and i don't even enter M+. Most players are much more casual than you think Towel
[3:05:53] SuperCracker: Unless your already geared good luck getting invited to a 10
[3:06:02] crusadermagnus: @Towelliee pve needs conquest, and also needs a way to upgrade the loot dropped content into 226~ if you have a certain milestone achievement
[3:06:03] itsTwigs_: love hearing you talk about random shit while I grind bgs
[3:06:07] Contractual_: Couldn't you just... level up your own key with friends?

[3:10:35] Contractual_: an alternative catchup mechanic would just be to start applying a buff to the raids and to increase the ilvl rewards from m+ at lower levels.
[3:11:16] dutchie76: lol
[3:11:25] dutchie76: hes a stage hand Kappa
[3:11:34] Contractual_: They've done it effectively every xpac - with one mechanic or another

[3:53:05] Apokolipz: monkaSoap
[3:53:11] NewWorldReign: @derudin Yeah, I heard he fucked up his ACL or something
[3:53:11] PadidinJones: You can but it would technically be a lesser form of it
[3:53:13] Antitux: Spousal unit is in education, so puts us on the short list.
[3:53:23] Darkaon: @derudin me choking you out then stomping on your face is only because you were unconscious. what a dumb arguement. lmao
[3:53:28] Lemonmunch3r: You can have it in a way, it doesn't multiply in your body if you're vaccinated

[3:53:54] derudin: did u even watch the fight lmao

[3:54:17] anjin89: @Antitux not meaning you, but you still get transmit it to others
[3:54:18] Darkaon: hes 32 mcgregor is fine. but he is a bum and should retire.
[3:54:28] Apokolipz: a double birthday fun
[3:54:32] Antitux: @anjin89 I understand what you meant.

[5:04:41] Kromede: previous yes, not this

[5:13:44] Provision_: @Aphro_Samurai just do dungeon to 60 goes quick
[5:14:01] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee type /gladius then enter and click lock, once you do that once on each toon it wont keep popping up
[5:14:14] Aphro_Samurai: @Provision_ i will once i get done with the last aiding quest
[5:14:31] Keyastaron_: DansGame 7 weeks
[5:14:55] HeIlraiser_: lol
[5:15:00] qtla: Killing 2 rares give you 4 lvl eye
[5:15:04] Epixil: wait how much rep is wrath of jailer?
[5:15:09] Reklusion: I have 9k rep to go with them and I must have forgotten to do like 1 weeks of dailies atleast
[5:15:14] HeIlraiser_: you get nothing how are you behind
[5:15:18] CritcobainTV: I'm almost exalted now, and i haven't done dailies or anything in the maw apart from weekly shit in like 3 weeks
[5:15:23] sagethemage40: lol I haven’t done anything in the maw since week three
[5:15:24] akia03: you have to do it on every toon
[5:15:29] CritcobainTV: I'm not mythic raiding so i dont have shit to socket just yet
[5:15:43] lithium364: noone in my guild does maw quests anymore, its dead content for people who dont care about sockets

[5:15:52] syracho: What item level gear should you socket minimum?
[5:15:58] HeIlraiser_: no point putting sockets on shit gear
[5:16:18] Herandae: You know what they say, exploit early, exploit often
[5:16:24] nihav: 226+ should be only socketed
[5:16:43] foxies_havocing: @HeIlraiser_ they got +14s don first week of m+s and put sockets on those 226 items basically safe item for the rest of the season
[5:17:00] syracho: @nihav Thank you, Ive been wondering for weeks if I should spend my currency
[5:17:01] unholyhoit: one could be in shadowmeld :)
[5:17:12] WoW_StandalonE: that's a hunter in druid disguise
[5:17:19] Dizmal: ive been casual and doing okay
[5:17:26] Dizmal: im just saving sockets for next raid teir
[5:17:32] Dragonsland7: DO you know what the race Ve'nari is? Was wondering what to call those beings lol
[5:17:48] Secondbreakfasttt: i could buy 5 sockets but just bought 1 for my lego. i'm 216 ilevel and no of my items are worthy enought get socketed
[5:18:09] CritcobainTV: They're italian obviously. Always hustling money.
[5:18:17] CritcobainTV: giving loans n shit
[5:18:27] Dragonsland7: the SL mafia
[5:18:30] Epixil: towelliee what is your favorite part about this expansion?
[5:18:48] HeIlraiser_: ahh now that cool
[5:18:52] Hitmanblood: Towelliee how do you feel about torghast, i LOVE IT, but the issue is the rewards feel lake luster.
[5:18:57] dicapz: How does this exp compare to others so far?
[5:19:01] Strik3r019: ethereals r from the void
[5:19:04] foxies_havocing: amazing dungeons but not as amazin as in legion i'd say
[5:19:04] actionring: word of glory 💕💕
[5:19:09] Crowzcut: pvp lol
[5:19:16] dicapz: I miss legion
[5:19:33] CritcobainTV: The expansion would be better if the pve gearing was slightly better imo
[5:19:34] Hitmanblood: the issue is you can be finished way to early in the week, its great for casuals, but if you play every day it gets old
[5:19:37] CritcobainTV: Everything else is fun as fuck
[5:19:43] foxies_havocing: fity-fity
[5:19:58] Secondbreakfasttt: imagine killeng all tier boses not getting any piece of gear. damn this is awful
[5:20:04] GrazzloTV: Wish there was more class lore like Legion and more of class hall like stuff

[5:20:15] deaglekotts: How often does the dropchance reset on these world bosses? once a day or once a week?
[5:20:25] mmrghost7: just remove Bdk spec and be done with it
[5:20:27] CritcobainTV: like more than half my gear is pvp and i mostly raid. the pve gearing is just slow as hell
[5:20:29] snuffles_80: what ilvl reward is if for doing 5 timewalking dungeon?
[5:20:30] Tessiuz: i dont
[5:20:34] Tessiuz: i love the optional shit
[5:20:45] 24sevn: need titanforging back Kappa
[5:20:45] Surpriize: yeah but not everyone can play 16hours of the day like you
[5:20:47] HeIlraiser_: that was my game now its gone
[5:20:51] Tessiuz: dont make shit mandatory again
[5:20:51] idenkaz_: can we go back and value the time players put into the game? its so unrewarding to do high M+
[5:20:52] xxKrayzie: god bless its optional^^
[5:20:57] nubsauce13: 200 @snuffles_80
[5:20:58] Aerated1: If i had to do wq's and shit everyday id tear my hair out
[5:20:59] MN_Generic: yeah but when you had to do it everyone bitch about it back then
[5:21:00] Epixil: true anima sucks
[5:21:05] Siddyy: i'd argue a lot of people hated it because it was too time consuming. not everyone is a streamer that can play for 10+ hours a day every day and make money (not a dis just the truth)
[5:21:13] Aerated1: soulbinds have a tie to your power too tho
[5:21:16] lesseh: gearing is super fast this expac??
[5:21:17] NickLeonhearth: new WQs are ass
[5:21:17] Khalio23: Guess the honeymoon phase is over
[5:21:23] bigb0ngrip: I'm ilvl 181 when should I get into doing sockets and legendary crafting? newer to the game can't find any advice on this.
[5:21:27] Rygothx: are they changing the gearing system soon? i hope so
[5:21:30] CritcobainTV: I don't farm anima because it's literally useless. You literally don't get any power farming anima and upgrading your sanctum at all which is fucking stupid to me
[5:21:31] qtla: @Towelliee In my opionion bfa was far better
[5:21:33] HeIlraiser_: then you need meta for pvp or no pvpv
[5:21:44] MarquisLek: i mean it's better then bfa
[5:21:45] idenkaz_: well we eat that shit everytime and blizzard knows they can do it, based on numbers people still play and thats why they did it. fuk that. im mad. sry.
[5:21:47] Keyastaron_: came for the gear stayed for the story
[5:21:53] MarquisLek: but it's not better then cata

[5:22:22] deaglekotts: How often does the dropchance reset on these world bosses? once a day or once a week?

[5:22:27] bluedragon319: Realms connected can: Share the same auction house, you can join guilds on other connected realms, can trade and exchange mail between connected realms, And you can party for mythic dungeons and mythic raids with players connected to yours as well
[5:22:37] Siddyy: i think the grind is for cosmetic or little fun on the side, and i love that. shit i don't have time to farm power every single day just to be a consideration for a raid lol
[5:22:44] CritcobainTV: !woons
[5:22:45] Tr3th0n: bring back valor points
[5:22:47] SorionTheGinger: would not mind 50% haste just for funnsies
[5:22:48] qtla: Bring back memory of lucid dreams, rogue is so starved of energy
[5:22:51] Khalio23: Guys theres nothing wrong with taking a break from the game, im playing warframe and runescape atm and im having a grand ol time not worrying about blizzard lackluster system atm
[5:22:58] mmrghost7: TRUUUUUUE
[5:23:01] chappers04: grinding powers every day is a waste of time.
[5:23:05] Juniorc954: @towelliee How about Poirier?!? Shocks the world!! USA!!! Bye Bye McGregor
[5:23:18] CritcobainTV: RIP McGregor
[5:23:22] WoW_StandalonE: I like the feeling when you are not grinding 24h then u are immediately behind
[5:23:26] chappers04: it should be capped, like anima is. Then people can do other shit e.g raids and dungeons
[5:23:42] shadecrawler: which AddOn displays the Percentiles TopLeft?
[5:23:46] Hitmanblood: gotta love doing 20 mythic plus for no gear,
[5:23:50] CritcobainTV: @Chappers04 it is capped though. You can only buy so many pieces with conquest
[5:23:53] HeIlraiser_: solo rbg Ques will help
[5:23:55] Siddyy: no no no artifact (anima) grinding as a means of empowering yourself. that's what we feel like is a waste, and don't like :)
[5:23:58] bigb0ngrip: @khalio23 total opposite I quit rs after max n started wow haha
[5:24:02] Badilak: I think people play alts now, because gearing up is fast up to a certain point
[5:24:20] murtokqt: In shadowlands: Better the player you are, easier it to get loot, a.k.a high pvp gear/ high m+ gear / mythic raid loot
[5:24:21] Tr3th0n: I am fine with the low gear drop. but the alternative 35 anima is just too low
[5:24:26] kranyoldlady: gearing sucks imo, specially if you dont have the time to invest in wow (due to work, covid) so i get to ply not on a high lvl wich sucks gearingwise
[5:24:26] Secondbreakfasttt: true
[5:24:31] Artivicii: yeah 190 is easy AF, couple days maybe
[5:24:36] chappers04: yeah stuff is capped. but its going back to old wow. They saw in classic when you have to grind gear to get strong people are more invested
[5:24:38] garkhyt: 200 is where the draught starts
[5:24:44] Dragonsland7: I really just play one toon, and I wanted some opinions. Is it crazy to play each Cov to renown 60 casually to enjoy the story? I really dont want to feel pressured to play alts...
[5:24:49] esceti95: idk I ran all mythic 0s on my alt and only dropped 3 items which is wierd
[5:24:56] Artivicii: 205 is ResidentSleeper towF
[5:24:57] mmrghost7: the thing is modern wow can not be like this
[5:25:08] Rygothx: You can easily get 200 - if you do PVP!
[5:25:10] Tensei_c: didn't CN drop more the first week and they changed it to less
[5:25:10] bigb0ngrip: 190+ pve isn't fast at all but pvp yeah cake
[5:25:13] idenkaz_: so its confirmed
[5:25:18] chappers04: Slightly wrong, they shouldnt give more gear out
[5:25:22] idenkaz_: nice
[5:25:23] HeIlraiser_: ian said he learnt from classic. must of been the wrong things
[5:25:29] flanstew: Though probably create a currency system like valor
[5:25:30] WoW_StandalonE: I think they were right, just pvp gearing broken
[5:25:30] chappers04: Mythic raiders should still have the highest item
[5:25:40] unholyhoit: Where is this "they'll change it" coming from? All I read in that interview is "He'll look into it" Lawyered as fuck.
[5:25:41] mmrghost7: it couldnt be more wrong
[5:25:44] Tr3th0n: doing all 10 bosses without a singel piece of loot is bad. and getting 350 anima instead doesnt feel good for time invested
[5:25:46] Xerevil: i just got here what are the changes?
[5:25:46] Artivicii: 190 takes like 10 hours with m+, after that KEKW
[5:26:02] idenkaz_: people want their time to be valued. no gear means mad.
[5:26:09] andaigan: @Towelliee Have only been playing classic. How did they break pve loot in shadowlands?

[5:26:15] lanara233: It's snowing in London today
[5:26:16] Dizmal: yeah rubbish idea man
[5:26:19] KingSlayerYotam: we need to remove the "classic gear" mentality, it just won't work in today's world
[5:26:22] raspyoftow: ya i miss my tokens :)
[5:26:25] actionring: I didn't get a single gear upgrade through whole story line
[5:26:25] mmrghost7: less gear ? more like no gear
[5:26:26] Dizmal: ive done my 10 M+ and got zero items from that
[5:26:30] 24sevn: asmongold was wrong
[5:26:35] Coragarm: No gears means max because everyone was getting spoiled with how much gear blizzard was throwing at you previously
[5:26:37] lesseh: Just go play pvp and get 226 gear?
[5:26:40] Dizmal: also even in Raids, a 10/10 heroic clear = zero loot
[5:26:42] keeindordel: they gonna give us a GREAT VAULT RE-ROLL option.. WATCH! @Towelliee
[5:26:46] Juniorc954: @towelliee any chance Brady and the Bucs beat Rodgers and the Packers tonight ?
[5:26:49] Hitmanblood: is like normal raid gear is useless
[5:26:52] Hitmanblood: makes no sense
[5:26:54] mmrghost7: just bring back TD 4Head
[5:26:56] The_Boctor: morning towelliee
[5:27:00] bigb0ngrip: @dizmal how? I thought it was guranteed loot each week?
[5:27:12] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: TD?
[5:27:18] ylcard: so if they hit ilvl 260 (or whatever) the same thing will happen
[5:27:18] snuffles_80: I miss Titanforging :D
[5:27:20] WoW_StandalonE: Ian said that in general, they are happy how the expansion is working atm
[5:27:20] HeIlraiser_: cant expect players to line up for 8 hours trying to get a rgb game so they can upgrade
[5:27:21] chappers04: Id rather do dungeon and raids to work for gear than having to spam world quests
[5:27:35] Tr3th0n: weekly vault is good but not enough yeah
[5:27:35] Lithitus: whhich weak aura shows you the time to next level? in the top mid?
[5:27:39] ARmunkki: imo the vault should at least give gear for your SPEC
[5:27:41] ylcard: whats the incentive for people to continue playing? just ilvl?
[5:27:46] Xerevil: they should give us the option of picking more items from the vault,maybe 2 max
[5:27:50] raspyoftow: the more poop boss
[5:28:00] Coragarm: Isn’t ilvl the main incentive always?
[5:28:01] MsBlueBunny: I went through normal and heroic without any drops. The loot drop rate is terrible.
[5:28:06] Artivicii: hmm i kinda like that fix
[5:28:15] Artivicii: unlikely tho yeah
[5:28:16] Khandak: I think a currency to buy gear like pvp is the best option
[5:28:18] snuffles_80: the WQ rewards sucks ass.. the renown reward that makes WQ gear higher is just crap
[5:28:19] susey221: easy fix would be to be able to take one piece from each content
[5:28:20] Sandisy: the disconnect between effort and reward feels kinda bad with the vault. for me anyway
[5:28:21] Voxxzz: Whats wrong with doing more content to get more options for gear?
[5:28:22] Rygothx: that would be too easy
[5:28:25] idenkaz_: i dont think it would fix it. they need people to want go into content not avoiding it
[5:28:27] HeIlraiser_: convent awards are virtually trash
[5:28:30] susey221: *from vault
[5:28:31] Secondbreakfasttt: they never do that ! 2 pieces? it's a bit much
[5:28:33] deaglekotts: How often does the dropchance reset on these world bosses? once a day or once a week?
[5:28:39] ylcard: @Bluebunnymh not to everyone, questing/lore is pretty decent, that's actual content
[5:28:41] flanstew: Yeah currency system is probably ideal
[5:28:42] wardog001: i would like the bonus roll back
[5:28:47] Cippy1111: just bring garrisons back... problem solved Kappa
[5:28:54] Artivicii: 3 towPog
[5:29:04] mmrghost7: some ppl just dont like pvp
[5:29:07] lanara233: That's why tokens are good, they're a reward but they're not a whole piece of gear
[5:29:10] keeindordel: @Towelliee HOW DO U FEEL about ppl with the ELITE rank in pvp getting 3 chances at getting 233 ilvl gear tht surpasses mythic castle anthria raiding gear?
[5:29:16] idenkaz_: i refuse to do pvp.
[5:29:16] Tr3th0n: increase anima gains and add anima vendor .or increase covenant armor ilvl
[5:29:17] Tensei_c: 3 pieces per week is much?
[5:29:22] susey221: I think its okay cuz in bfa we had one from m+, one from pvp and raid dropped way more loot
[5:29:30] bigb0ngrip: feels good being a new player don't have to worry about what it used to be just having loads of fun in sl
[5:29:40] xRoughneck: I think there are plenty of sources for gear, but what I find kinda strange is that the ilvls are all over the place. Like covenant gear was irrelevant for the first couple weeks, like right from the start.
[5:29:42] D1Chile: the main issue is that pve option for gear a re just terrible compare to pvp option top get gear so they will just prob pull a valor vendor option lol
[5:29:45] Joagames: Joagames subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 91 months! 
[5:29:49] lesseh: much easier to do mythic raiding than hitting elite
[5:29:54] chappers04: those people who pvp in that elite, dont do anything other than pvp
[5:30:01] Lemonmunch3r: So fresh to hear that
[5:30:01] HeIlraiser_: would be nice
[5:30:04] esceti95: make vault have an option to give 2 items only if you unlock all slots
[5:30:08] snuffles_80: as a casual pvper you wont get 230+ gear
[5:30:12] kranyoldlady: worldquests are not incentive atm
[5:30:15] Jay_Vee_NL: casuals just stay casuals period just like in classic
[5:30:29] keeindordel: @Chappers04 NOT TRUE im3/10 Mythic in a raiding guild and im getting 226 gear atm cuz im 2.2k in RATED BGS 2.4k is elite rank
[5:30:30] Coragarm: ^^
[5:30:38] chappers04: mythic raiders, elite pvpers should be at the top of the itemlvl. But yeah giving 2 pieces from the vault would help.
[5:30:40] idenkaz_: people should know by now that the game gets carried by casuals. every day. time to take them for full and give them a reason to play.
[5:30:48] Rygothx: Just make anima purchase and upgrade gear. People would be doing alot of content then.
[5:30:50] hovyirl: casuals should stay casual, you fucking babies wanting the best shit for no effort ruin this game :spit:
[5:30:52] CritcobainTV: Shit on a stick towPog
[5:30:55] keeindordel: @Chappers04 infact my guild leader and raid elader encourages our raiders to do pvp to gear up
[5:31:06] Jay_Vee_NL: give them some pets as rewards that will do em, they dont deserve good gear if u dont put in the effort :D
[5:31:13] Jay_Vee_NL: nor the skills
[5:31:14] brooksy4749: casuals pay the bills
[5:31:15] anithics: WoW is not in a good spot :(
[5:31:21] torvoltas: some of my guildies already left till next patch
[5:31:22] chappers04: @keeindordel yeah, but your high raiding. most guilds dont do that
[5:31:23] Gizadragon: casuals pays the bills lol
[5:31:25] Provision_: @hovyirl without casuals there will be no WoW LUL
[5:31:35] snuffles_80: never done a single pet battle so no thanks
[5:31:36] ThatGuyFayde: without casuals no wow lol
[5:31:39] ylcard: didn't all the self proclaimed hardcore moved on to classic? XD
[5:31:40] ultimusprim3: to be fair i'm enjoying ff14 more then WoW atm
[5:31:41] HeIlraiser_: some casuals play 12 hours a day lol
[5:31:41] keeindordel: i honestly kinda like the pvp gearing system.... i originally got into mythic raiding cuz i wanted powerful gear for pvp...
[5:31:44] Coragarm: @hovyirl seriously agree if you are casual nothing wrong with that just expect casual rewards
[5:31:46] angmaster: they need to sort this RGB rating thing. casuals cannot play in RGBs because they dont have any achievement to show or they dont have CR yet. So they won't be able to join RGB groups
[5:31:48] cysteicacid: is reputation important for raiding?
[5:31:59] chappers04: I just casually play, Ive done heroic castle. But i just log on and do a few mythics and a few bgs
[5:31:59] akia03: first month of sl my guild had about 3-400 people online a day now 40-50 a day
[5:32:04] Screamnsteam: Make WoW tokens worth more so I can pay to win for a better price
[5:32:08] hovyirl: @Provision_ yeah and you can still have a divide between good players and casual players. handing everything to everyone kills the game
[5:32:12] bludthirsty95: what are they changing with the loot system?
[5:32:13] angmaster: same goes for M+ dungeons. RIO is good but it is stupid to judge people's skill based on it only
[5:32:18] idenkaz_: just value our time we put into the game and all be fixed by the next tier. its just that easy
[5:32:24] neverbornlucky: i want a towellie pet i can abuse
[5:32:26] flanstew: Something like valor points in legion would be nice
[5:32:28] keeindordel: @Screamnsteam YESS bring back the WoW Token Gold prices back in Legion... 250k for a WoW token.. good times....
[5:32:41] Towelliee: !permit neverbornlucky
[5:32:42] Moobot: @neverbornlucky will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[5:32:43] bludthirsty95: i cant find any bluepost on the new loot system, whats the change ?
[5:32:56] Provision_: @hovyirl issue is, you need mythic raiding to get any decent upgrade, normal drops no upgrade and HC is so minimal upgrade it pointless.
[5:33:02] Hasselqt: anyne know how long season 1 pvp lasts?
[5:33:07] Artivicii: @Towelliee yo what legendary are you using on your pally for m+?
[5:33:14] Madnezz123: Community: Go back go back
[5:33:17] andaigan: My concern is that blizard's focus on subscriber retention and objective game quality/fun aren't going hand in hand. So WoW is going more in the direction of some kind of mobile game. Even though a lot of people keep playing, it doesn't mean it's actually fun to play
[5:33:19] snuffles_80: only reason I play wow right nos is that theres no new games Im interested in not until late feb-March
[5:33:19] notastuckgoat: I hit 202 and gave up haha now I just mount farm
[5:33:26] hovyirl: @Provision_ so put in more effort. if you're casual accept your fate
[5:33:29] Coragarm: So if you want the mythic raid gear then raid mythic
[5:33:32] SamULJackson: i know some old mates who preordered SL in BFA and havent even played it yet
[5:33:33] Zettabyte: Free gear? Blasphemy! Kappa
[5:33:35] akia03: whatever happend to that mount we voted on?
[5:33:37] idenkaz_: i mean you always said they will never go back to Draenor numbers, so i have high hopes they fix it.
[5:33:44] whiffking_404: reusable flask
[5:33:46] Alexkayzz: timewalking gear now drops loot from future raids Kappa
[5:33:51] cysteicacid: I felt like gearing up my main was fast with joining my raidteam, but the alts are soo slow, i can do like hc and normal raids and really get nothing
[5:33:56] flanstew: Do you think they would do something for the people who have been grinding from the beginning
[5:33:58] Crowzcut: y
[5:34:00] WoW_StandalonE: free gear is just a temporary solution, ppl will quit anyway, that's how MMOs work these days
[5:34:03] Provision_: @hovyirl people did full normal + heroic + part mythic and had no upgrade for 2-3weeks, what more effort you want from people?
[5:34:09] dicapz: Shadowlands success is because of covid
[5:34:16] bigb0ngrip: all yalls wining killing my vibe for the game LUL
[5:34:16] Artivicii: @dicapz KEKW
[5:34:26] MsBlueBunny: add gear to torghast.
[5:34:28] hapsthehamster: we get that when we stopped saying stuff is sucky and just do as blizz says
[5:34:47] KhalaVenix: true
[5:34:49] idenkaz_: torghast is such a let down, im still mad af
[5:35:01] Valdur359: how about PVE rating - if you did high key level you can upgrade your gear higher
[5:35:02] hovyirl: @Provision_ m+ and pvp kiddo. if you can't be bothered to touch other pillars of the game you're just a casual. my alt is 220 ilvl and hasn't stepped into a raid. accept your fate as a casual and stop trying to ruin the game
[5:35:05] Coragarm: Dude in vanilla it would take a month to get an upgrade sometimes player base is just used to be spoiled

[5:35:10] Altore__: I just want an endless mode Torghast
[5:35:16] MsBlueBunny: if they added gear to torghast I would have so much fun.
[5:35:18] Marcinek_xP: It really has Zero replayability.
[5:35:19] Hitmanblood: the rewards are garbage, torghast itself is something pretty unique
[5:35:24] sliced17: torghast needsmore cosmetic rewards, not gear
[5:35:32] Sandisy: twisting corridors will make a comeback with 8 more fresh layers for you to climb for a flying maw mount KEKW
[5:35:34] snuffles_80: i hvent even bothered doing the thorgast thing were yoy looking for clues of Anduin
[5:35:35] Provision_: @hovyirl how are casuals ruining the game? You got your gear as Elitist, so how it effect you?
[5:35:42] snipsfan: toragst is general should just be optional for cosmetics or achievements
[5:35:43] idenkaz_: yeah but the all the possibilites man .. just imagine how big torghast would be if they´d do it right :-(
[5:35:46] Biggyxx: Biggyxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[5:35:47] sagethemage40: Love the legion music
[5:36:00] Madnezz123: I havent completed a single layer on twisting corridors
[5:36:00] lesseh: i fucking cant kill layer 18 boss...
[5:36:00] Crowzcut: lol
[5:36:04] lanara233: @Coragarm I somewhat agree with that. We're still transitioning away from a world in which it rained gear and gold.
[5:36:05] Artivicii: 16 LUL
[5:36:07] Badilak: "Any mount can be used in the maw" will be the next one
[5:36:09] hovyirl: @Provision_ because you're crying and want everything handed to you, which leads to game changes that diminish the divide between those who earn gear and those who are given it for free
[5:36:10] GrazzloTV: And a toy that turns you into something cool for 10 minutes with a 24 hour cooldown
[5:36:12] Hitmanblood: im sure layer freaking 24 will be the last layer or something
[5:36:18] akia03: how are they going to keep the tower relivamt for the whole xpac
[5:36:21] MsBlueBunny: XD
[5:36:31] Coragarm: @provision_ because casuals are demanding elite gear for not doing elite content. Since when should you get more for doing less
[5:36:31] Hitmanblood: blizzard pulling a cyberpunk 2077 LUL
[5:36:37] snuffles_80: they still havent fixed Legacy Raids yet.. legion raids are harder now at 60 then at lvl 50
[5:36:42] angmaster: thorghast is punishing not challenging
[5:36:43] ExigentMidnight: They could have rewarded a couple hundred anima and it would be the best thing to run
[5:36:44] idenkaz_: it hurts :-(
[5:36:45] lanara233: Fast gear feels good at first but it becomes worthless faster too.
[5:36:48] Akitor123: achievement :)
[5:36:48] MaRiNexICEx: ya I love the idea of torghast and how it plays and the different things you can do. but I don't like just grinding it for nothing
[5:36:48] NestLucky: if the transmog are the legendaries appareances??
[5:36:49] angmaster: no loot, no gold nothing
[5:36:51] Provision_: @hovyirl No, people want reward for effort they put in. If you defending that thhe game give no rewards for clearing raids multiple weeks in a row... you are the issue LUL
[5:37:00] snipsfan: they could have stuffed torgast full of sick cosmetics and achievements and mounts but they put almost NOTHING in there...
[5:37:02] Alaquane: why do I have to right click every corpse in torghast?
[5:37:05] DesiHeat: hi @Towelliee como estas fuegoLove
[5:37:07] Dyriks: The tower of dead content LUL
[5:37:14] Marcinek_xP: On top of that, doesnt it cause durability damage to your gear?
[5:37:14] Khalio23: Ive not seen you this dissapointed in an expansion in a long time towel
[5:37:22] idenkaz_: yeah they refuse to make Legion actual Legacy loot ... i dont get it.
[5:37:24] Madnezz123: whats the max renown for this week?
[5:37:25] hovyirl: @Provision_ cringe baby casual
[5:37:31] ExigentMidnight: laughs in WildStar
[5:37:37] DesiHeat: fuegoYay
[5:37:37] angmaster: if you are not lucky or your class is not good enough for thorghast you will only waste time and nothing to show for
[5:37:41] ExigentMidnight: *Laughs in WildStar*
[5:37:44] Aphro_Samurai: what they did is almost insulting to us lol @Towelliee
[5:38:01] Crowzcut: @hovyirl calm down abit
[5:38:18] ARmunkki: @Provision_ Good luck talking to elitists LUL
[5:38:20] Osowareru: saddest thing is that you have to do the 8 layers all over again on alts in torghast
[5:38:38] neverbornlucky: stay the path towellie
[5:38:43] Provision_: @hovyirl I'm 221 myself LUL I dont have an issue. Just see my guild people struggling to catch up and not able to do higher mythics / raids because of lack of drops / gear progression
[5:38:44] ExigentMidnight: So basically just regular WildStar
[5:38:46] MaRiNexICEx: I enjoyed wildstar lol
[5:38:49] cysteicacid: do u think sire d was too "easy" om mythic?
[5:38:59] Crowzcut: i heard microsoft want buy wildstar op
[5:39:25] 210Crawler: Whatever happen to Wildstar
[5:39:48] raspyoftow: it was a kick in the balls pretty much
[5:40:12] bigb0ngrip: ahh okay I can see how that can make people upset wasn't aware they lead people on like that
[5:40:15] ExigentMidnight: I think you're right about them hurting during Covid and it wouldn't surprise me if Torghast features got cut in the crunch
[5:40:15] iseenoobpeoplee: LUL
[5:40:16] Alexkayzz: tbh islands are better than twisting corridors KEKW
[5:40:17] akia03: you think thats because so many people hated thorgast so much before tc was released they just stopped putting stuff there
[5:40:19] snuffles_80: I get oneshotted by those corrupted angels in TC in floor 17

[5:40:22] bigb0ngrip: the maw and torghast is shit my only complaint
[5:40:22] MsBlueBunny: They are so behind. There is no way they are anywhere near where they wanted to be. I don't understand why they would lie.
[5:40:24] lanara233: What do we think about Torghast from a legendary point of view?
[5:40:31] Artivicii: aye
[5:40:33] idenkaz_: problem is Blizzard would never admit that they are behind so we never know what we will actually get in the end ..
[5:40:33] Dragonsland7: An actual set themed from the maw would be nice to compliment the legos
[5:40:37] Kromede: ei - only germans can laugh Kappa
[5:40:37] DSpawn81: AAAAnd a shittShow
[5:40:38] snipsfan: they should have stuffed toragast full of sick cosmetics, mounts, achievements, raid supplies
[5:40:41] Crowzcut: ready have really people you building the new fable they ones what done wildstar
[5:40:47] Marcinek_xP: LETS STORM THE BLIZZARD CAPITOL!!!
[5:40:55] neverbornlucky: belive in the path towllie dont stray
[5:40:58] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee That beneficial to crummy mythic prog guilds like mine xD
[5:40:59] Akitor123: next raid 3 bosses
[5:41:14] Gwarrar02: April would be quick though
[5:41:20] Shrenko: towel farming Oondasta this early in the expansion pikaOMG
[5:41:24] lanara233: So true. If a delayed game doesn't indicate they're behind, what does? :)
[5:41:26] ExigentMidnight: I wonder if Blizzard is "rationing" art assets because of the delays
[5:41:27] Galadeon: Every 6 floors of each layer should award some kind of cosmetic
[5:41:34] idenkaz_: true
[5:41:38] idenkaz_: mb
[5:41:45] Shrenko: we havent had a patch yet though :D
[5:41:50] murtokqt: Torghast was "advertised" as hard cointent and turned out to be easiest content so far in SL
[5:41:51] Crowzcut: im glad towel doing mount runs to show how sl his these days
[5:42:05] Provision_: Even Legion weapon system was not great, but at least you were progressing something over time

[5:42:21] MsBlueBunny: Yesssssss
[5:42:30] Lemonmunch3r: Yes please
[5:42:32] qtla: Covenatns and solubinds are so underweling and they hyped them so much, Its just sad
[5:42:41] Aervyper: @Towelliee I loved Islands cause it was fun and had awewsome rewards..... Visions was too stressful and Torghast is a cesspool of garbage with zero rewards
[5:42:42] bigb0ngrip: or you could buy a boost Jebaited
[5:42:43] xMortal_Wombatx: How long does the firelands raid take?
[5:42:45] idenkaz_: no thanks :D
[5:42:45] Lemonmunch3r: That's literally what killed my alt ambitions
[5:42:52] Crowzcut: yes what a pain
[5:42:52] bigb0ngrip: multiple character boost
[5:42:59] Shrenko: I feel like Torghast is fun on alts because of new poers
[5:43:01] Shrenko: powers*
[5:43:09] mythradrill: well they have to feed MAUS somehow
[5:43:09] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:43:12] Altore__: I'd love to have an endless Torghast where you get loot based on how many floors you clear
[5:43:16] GodKingMuninn: Rhyolith is just bugged
[5:43:26] Zigg3man: agree, I also want to do Torghast 1 time, then unlocked on all alts... so much time consuming as it is now...
[5:43:28] Crowzcut: max killed him
[5:43:31] Gwarrar02: Done the layer 1-8 on six toons so far and it's just a brutal time sink.
[5:43:32] Tessiuz: yo @Towelliee you in a mood today? :D
[5:43:41] ExigentMidnight: I like Torghast but I don't have 3 extra WoW hours a week to get my soul ash and put in a Twisting Corridors attempt
[5:43:42] Provision_: @Altore__ yeah why not make a leaderboard for the fun of it, so people can at least have fun that way
[5:43:50] snuffles_80: D:
[5:43:50] Shrenko: pikaOMG
[5:43:52] Hitmanblood: at least islands took 5 minutes lol
[5:43:54] Siddyy: D:
[5:43:54] Jay_Vee_NL: true
[5:43:55] Khalio23: Trueeeeee
[5:43:58] MsBlueBunny: LUL
[5:43:59] CritcobainTV: and islands didn't take nearly as long
[5:44:00] xxKrayzie: stop right here
[5:44:01] Altore__: Torghast could've basically been Greater Rifts from Diablo3
[5:44:03] Khalio23: couldnt agree more
[5:44:09] SONIKAO: BRA71L
[5:44:10] ExigentMidnight: Can you solo islands now?
[5:44:11] lanara233: Islands gave Conquest too (in pvp) :)
[5:44:17] idenkaz_: or a ingame leaderboard for Torghast would change the entire thing greatly benefit the game and content. pushing layers for some awesome rewards and to show it of on an actual leaderboard would be nuts.
[5:44:17] neverbornlucky: for the children toweliie
[5:44:20] Hitmanblood: i just wish blizzard wouldn't give up on systems that have potential and make them awesome
[5:44:21] Jay_Vee_NL: and islands could be done fast aswell
[5:44:30] Chrisfo79: True, torghast reward system is horrid if you can even call it a reward system
[5:44:31] Diaz_Dk: Asking for too much to early
[5:44:32] bigb0ngrip: man this game isn't that grindy at all try playing an ironman on runescape and tell me what ya think LUL
[5:44:32] Deydralon: I got my BiS lego, i aint going in there again
[5:44:33] CritcobainTV: aye who wants to run some islands
[5:44:36] Rygothx: Yeah at least you can get and farm mounts in islands
[5:44:40] Khalio23: Give us back some High risk high reward content blizz!
[5:44:50] Zigg3man: Twisting Corridors is fun tho.. the ONLY fun in Torghast imo.
[5:44:50] Galadeon: He’s smoking the good stuff
[5:44:51] snipsfan: they dropped the ball hard on torgast rewards. hopefully a change is coming
[5:44:53] CritcobainTV: now hide it
[5:44:57] CritcobainTV: and it shouldn't pop up on that toon again
[5:45:02] Aervyper: @Khalio23 do you got your Maw mount?
[5:45:12] Nakkita76: Britt2376 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[5:45:24] Shrenko: @Hitmanblood exactly!! if you see how ESO and FFXIV does it they keep old system viable even years later. like in WoW the old system from previous expansions is just kinda useless. same with dungeons except when timewalking is up
[5:45:24] pikajazz32: Morning Towellieea and chat!
[5:45:40] Valdur359: @Towelliee I remember people wanted to do torghast even if there are no rewards just for fun
[5:45:42] HeIlraiser_: pages LUL
[5:45:42] Khalio23: @Aervyper Yes but, besides that, what is there to get for doing challenging content?
[5:46:08] bigb0ngrip: what's your favorite thing about sl?
[5:46:22] Diaz_Dk: That’s a weak list LUL
[5:46:33] CritcobainTV: oh, yeah nah ur just fucked on that one, unless you disable it on every toon in the character selection screen it hink?
[5:46:33] Aervyper: @Khalio23 at least you got it i stopped at floor 2 cause it was just stupid
[5:46:34] cabalish: i am not that optimistic about 9.1, but lets see where it leads us too
[5:46:35] CritcobainTV: I think*
[5:46:43] userrx: pvp is more fun in SL , they did good i guess
[5:46:49] Shrenko: still not better than Legion dungeons imo!
[5:46:54] bludthirsty95: exactly.... too many people worry about the gear. M+ in general is really fun because the dungeons are amazing
[5:46:55] andaigan: How would you rate the dungeons against bfa dungeons?
[5:46:58] Gwarrar02: Necrotic wake on tyrannical is soooo not fun.
[5:47:00] Tessiuz: im loving pvp
[5:47:02] MsBlueBunny: Love DoS and HoA
[5:47:03] Bwelder87: pvp is garbage with gear gap advantage and 1 shots lol
[5:47:06] Provision_: Agree, the dungeons keep me subbed. else i would had stopped prob
[5:47:19] bec0o: i never pvp in wow
[5:47:22] sawnerus: pvp's the best its been in years
[5:47:23] Aervyper: @Towelliee if your an average player and you only PVE then your in hell... and the game sucks for you
[5:47:25] Khalio23: @Aervyper I dident, i lied. But anyhow you gotta admit that torghast is flawed as for solo content goes
[5:47:28] mmrghost7: i never touch that shiit
[5:47:29] bec0o: if i wanted to pvp i play Blackdesert
[5:47:39] Shrenko: PVP is fun now
[5:47:40] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I had a 2400 DK in a heroic raid tell me that pvp fire mages do better dps than pve fire mages because they know their single target rotation better LUL
[5:47:42] snipsfan: and as you said, sick transmogs cool unique achievements, mounts/recolor seems it would be sooo simple to add in. maybe even extra anima or something to help towards sanctum, more stygia maybe. hell anything
[5:47:45] MsBlueBunny: I just started PvP. I am actually enjoying it.
[5:47:58] Aervyper: @Khalio23 then get back in there that's as hard of content you'll find solo in the game
[5:47:59] mmrghost7: pvp is fun if u are not Bdk
[5:48:23] TitaniumPrime7: I def stopped playing cause I got tired of wasting my 3 or 4 hours after work not getting any loot in M+
[5:48:23] ThudsonTV: WoW PvP - who can CC stun or mez more people longer
[5:48:25] GodKingMuninn: I don't think 'overlook' counts, they didn't even look. Its like when you accidentally knock something over in a store behind you and you just keep walking and dont look at it.
[5:48:39] ARmunkki: PvP is fun if you're a boomkin one shotting everyone
[5:48:51] CritcobainTV: You can get conquest, but getting the rating to upgrade is aids for pve only players
[5:48:58] HeIlraiser_: then they cant get a rgb team
[5:48:58] cysteicacid: soo true
[5:49:05] EllisTheMenace1: worst part is some class bis is pvp gear for pve
[5:49:08] bigb0ngrip: @snipsfan I agree. they could add in loads more cosmetics I don't like alot of the older sets especially mail ones they're so bad.
[5:49:11] Tessiuz: just git gud
[5:49:19] Aervyper: @Towelliee but for the average person ilvl 200 is the top of the mountain it doesn't get better than that and to reach the next mountain it's soooooo daunting
[5:49:20] Khalio23: @Aervyper Not gonna resub just for that, there need to be content for more substance, not just 1 mount. i want more fluff / gear etc to keep me engaged in challenging content.
[5:49:28] Khalio23: with more*
[5:49:31] sawnerus: ur not conq capping unless ur doing rated pvp anyways
[5:49:31] Kainiee: is 1750 in 2s 226 gear?
[5:49:39] Zigg3man: Blizz should implement system like PvP has it... add vendor or currency system back.... lack of rewards as it is now in PvE
[5:49:41] Jokervenom1978: As a casual player I hate pvp with a passion and i refuse to do it just to get gear.
[5:49:53] DSpawn81: Buy a tank is the new shitt on LFG
[5:49:53] idenkaz_: i upgrade covernant armour on alts with anima i got from WQ so far. helps out alot for early content
[5:49:56] garandor: that is exactly the same with each aspect of the game tho. You need to be 'better' at something to get better gear.. it's how it should be.

[5:50:48] sawnerus: most pvpers think otherwise
[5:51:08] cabalish: try stun the dino
[5:51:13] GodKingMuninn: I just hate how I'm crap in PvP if one covenant and good in PvE in another
[5:51:15] helstrider123: arent there more players now then the last 6 years?
[5:51:29] xxKrayzie: i work hard irl^^
[5:51:30] Gwarrar02: I personally like the pvp gear system...it makes sense. I hope they do the same thing for pve gear or up the reward for M+
[5:51:32] piratechris: If they keep it like that you will have a game with 500k subscribers. Enjoy your server merges etc
[5:51:32] idenkaz_: well know we actually realize even if bfa got alot of shit it was content overkill compared to SL
[5:51:35] GodKingMuninn: Yet they want us to do all aspects of gameplay...
[5:51:36] Skizzurp: and its also never really been a thing to pvp to get upgrades if you were a mythic raider and now you can get gear way faster if you do so its weird
[5:51:47] Alexkayzz: when pvp was the best source of gear in classic u didn't have to be "good" to get it, u had to play 16 hrs a day
[5:52:02] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee just pet taunt PogChamp
[5:52:05] Dyriks: or if your pets taunt?
[5:52:11] ExigentMidnight: People don't play wow anymore as a second career. They expect to put in reasonable hours and get reasonable rewards
[5:52:13] Laluzmia: You are right they need to get back on the ball and fix it or it going to bad for them
[5:52:27] CritcobainTV: Is miley cyrus the new pog champ? wth
[5:52:31] CritcobainTV: PogChamp
[5:52:31] GodKingMuninn: You can misdirect your pet
[5:52:35] Dyriks: oof
[5:52:38] idenkaz_: wait what
[5:52:39] bigb0ngrip: @laluzmia doubt it. they are loaded and still top mmo
[5:52:46] Aphro_Samurai: would distracting shot work?
[5:52:52] Shrenko: PogChamp
[5:52:56] idenkaz_: isnt that the "deer" ?
[5:53:02] Crowzcut: PogChamp
[5:53:02] GodKingMuninn: @Aphro_Samurai doeosn't exist
[5:53:03] bec0o: now gear is depended on IO score dosnt matter how good or bad are you
[5:53:05] CritcobainTV: SODAPOPPIN LMAFO
[5:53:06] mmrghost7: EUUUUW that emote is digsuting
[5:53:30] Aphro_Samurai: @Confused_Raven oof my age is showing kekw
[5:53:37] CritcobainTV: It's clearly andy milonakis Keepo
[5:53:48] Crowzcut: its that tranz guy
[5:54:03] Shrenko: BibleThump Arthas BibleThump Invinicible BibleThump
[5:54:05] piratechris: Well if they mess up they can conceivable drop down an not be the top MMO.
[5:54:06] sawnerus: this game isnt their cash crop anymore. doubt they care much lol
[5:54:10] ukladd: shadowlands has only been out like 2 months LUL
[5:54:11] Laluzmia: that was the same way ever quest was thinking when they was top
[5:54:15] Blackhaxx: not worth the sub anymore
[5:54:22] Provision_: @foozer_ what game is it then?
[5:54:22] reallygoodmostly: wait what's the issue?
[5:54:35] cysteicacid: casuals are not playing the game cuz holy priests are shit
[5:54:36] helstrider123: yea what issue? i just joined
[5:54:43] sawnerus: call of duty
[5:54:44] mmrghost7: at the same time ppl are impatient and they might leave the game in the meantime
[5:54:49] Noshpan: Not gonna lie, I thought about letting my WoW subscription lapse in a couple of months, then I paid for another 6 months LUL
[5:54:50] sawnerus: hearthstone/overwatch
[5:54:52] idenkaz_: doomer, feelsbadman
[5:55:03] Provision_: @foozer_ overwatch? LUL
[5:55:04] sawnerus: both games far more successful and bring in more money than wow
[5:55:04] kranyoldlady: lvl the rest of your alts up?
[5:55:05] MFAM_d3montyme: towHAMUP_BW
[5:55:07] Vadagar1: I got many 60's alts ready to get geared. They all just sitting at item level 130ish
[5:55:12] andaigan: As long as you're subbed blizzard doesn't really care how many chars you log into, no?
[5:55:14] Dragonsland7: Give players a Valor like currency for PVE base gear and upgrades?
[5:55:15] kranyoldlady: then gear it up in a month
[5:55:18] Shrenko: AngelThump
[5:55:35] Titley07: Titley07 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months, currently on a 60 month streak! towHype
[5:55:39] deathdealer75: is the fastest way to level alts still main story or did they change threads of fate yet?
[5:55:41] mmrghost7: we had a tank in our guild that literally left the game cuz he never got any weapon higher than 184 ,
[5:55:55] Lemonmunch3r: What iLvl do you think is ok to start mythic raiding?
[5:56:10] MsBlueBunny: 210
[5:56:15] bigb0ngrip: another thing that sucks is when I'm in a bg I get trolled by rogues one shotting and use spit emote on me
[5:56:21] Dragonsland7: Or is that the renown system now for gearing PVE gear? just slower than PVP?
[5:56:23] cysteicacid: yes u should get some kinda coin for each boos raid kill
[5:56:44] EllisTheMenace1: BRING VALOR BACK
[5:56:46] RazzeronTV: What you doing atm?
[5:56:50] reallygoodmostly: what's he killing this dino for
[5:56:55] D1Chile: @Towelliee u think a cumulative valor cap like the conquest cap would be good for pve?
[5:57:03] unholyhoit: They need to bring back valor for pieces that just won't drop and justice to upgrade them @Towelliee
[5:57:04] idenkaz_: @oteedee mount
[5:57:05] Noshpan: Killing the dino for a mount
[5:57:12] reallygoodmostly: ah cool, thanks
[5:57:14] Sincline387: so the tank never finished his cov quests and never did pvp?
[5:57:19] Dragonsland7: Sucks that Covenant pieces stop at 197, and don't go higher like PVP gear does
[5:57:27] bigb0ngrip: what's drop rate of mount
[5:57:39] Thirn94: !uptine
[5:57:49] idenkaz_: its very low under @bigb0ngrip
[5:57:55] Thirn94: !uptime
[5:57:55] Moobot: Towelliee has been live for 5h 58m
[5:58:07] Dragonsland7: well keep it time-gated for now, but later for next raid tier raise up the limit
[5:58:21] Dragonsland7: saying 7 of 7 kinda shows it's not meant to ever get better
[5:58:42] WoW_StandalonE: the main focus of wow is raiding, if u cant do even normal raids, then u should not expect to get the best gear
[5:58:51] Dragonsland7: Just figured it be better for people who want to remain the same Cov
[5:59:00] Skizzurp: its jsut catch up gears for alts its never going to be somehting that u actively want
[5:59:03] Dragonsland7: I plan to trry them all to renown 60
[5:59:09] Dragonsland7: im nuts though haha
[5:59:38] bigb0ngrip: damn LUL
[5:59:42] bigb0ngrip: man's grinding
[5:59:49] snipsfan: what about our leggos? will we get higher ranks or will the ones we have be replaced with new ones?
[5:59:51] Provision_: @WoW_StandalonE there your issue, raiding hardly give rewarded gear, so far on 2 weeks without a drop from normal + Heroic raiding
[5:59:58] bigb0ngrip: done passed 40 renown haha
[6:00:16] cysteicacid: isnt valor a vendor system?
[6:00:16] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[6:00:25] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee reverted it but like 15% less.
[6:00:30] MsBlueBunny: WoD
[6:00:41] Noshpan: Yeah WoD
[6:00:41] Dragonsland7: LUL I really like playing my Lock, and refused to go Night fae right away
[6:00:44] Wheeellz: we're gonna get valor but the gear is going to be on a weekly rotation
[6:00:44] helstrider123: so they should change the entire loot system because pve players dont want to push to 1400 pvp rating?
[6:00:54] WoW_StandalonE: @Provision_ I know but ppl r complaining they can't get higher 197 gear, but they don't want to do raids
[6:00:55] Sneakzx: I think a lot of people would be good with that system
[6:00:57] mvk315: drop rates are too low on raids done so many for only 1 piece
[6:01:03] szeeman62: @towelliee quick question I used your UI installer and now it’s randomly not showing party or raid frames should I just re install the ui?
[6:01:09] zoobu2: sucks when you decide another class is better to main once it's 60 but a month later gearing it will be so much easier
[6:01:11] bigb0ngrip: Agreed
[6:01:13] idenkaz_: jup
[6:01:17] HeIlraiser_: YEP
[6:01:26] Sandisy: you've always been able to get by just fine without pvp. these days you're behind if you don't
[6:01:26] TitaniumPrime7: yeah or im not gonna get the gear lmao. no pvp for me
[6:01:35] Provision_: @WoW_StandalonE Well i got moves out of the mythic raid team because other are better geared to progress, while i did every week my full clears...
[6:01:44] sawnerus: then why are people praising pvp lol
[6:01:44] HeIlraiser_: its not even about the rating the meta disallows it
[6:01:50] Skizzurp: and it isnt 1400 you have to hit like 1800-2100 which isnt jsut something a casual can do
[6:02:06] idenkaz_: the love for WoW is not endless ... people will leave.

[6:02:07] Blah206: you get 200 gear from conquest/vault alone. 1400 gives you 207
[6:02:10] GodKingMuninn: @helstrider123 Why would I want to go into an arena on a fresh alt. (Which i'm not going to be able to get gear from raiding yet) then get 1 shot by people twice my HP... Thats terrible... Plus you need 1800+ not 1400
[6:02:12] Sneakyy1S: Isnt itr just better to add PVP stats?
[6:02:13] WoW_StandalonE: @Provision_ well I don't buy that's the only reason lol
[6:02:23] Jasith: I'm not so sure the game needs more gear loot for doing content, but it needs a way better consolation for _not_ getting loot. Getting 35 anima for killing a raidboss or finishing an M+ is just a slap in the face.
[6:02:23] sawnerus: if people are speaking and u can hear it, enough enjoy it
[6:02:28] Aervyper: @Towelliee k.... i had this exact problem my main was stuck at ilvl 200.... i couldn't figure it out. i pushed to 1400 CR in 10vs10 and i felt on top of the world. I upgraded all my gear went and did a mythic 8+ missed the time by a minute and a ilvl 200 dropped went back to pvp
[6:02:32] vonblue: vonblue subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[6:02:37] Skizzurp: @Eross19 but then all the pvpers complain because all the work they do isnt good for them to be able to pve
[6:02:45] Its_an_implication: Also doesn't mean that all PVP gear is great for PVE. Valor for PVE gear is definitely better.
[6:02:47] helstrider123: they should just increase mythic+ ilvl for that imo i mean its the first time pvp actually matters, and i like it
[6:02:53] qtla: @Towelliee Pvp gear should have diminishing returns in pve instances and other way around
[6:03:03] Asteriix1: yes :)
[6:03:07] WeenieLinguineX: Man lfr should drop mythic ilvl gear cause itll be more accessible to pvp players :)
[6:03:07] Lemonmunch3r: I like pvping but I only have to queue with randoms, it sucks so hard to try and get rating that way
[6:03:15] sawnerus: are we arguing pvp gear being good in pve, or pvp gear gating?
[6:03:16] WoW_StandalonE: @Provision_ if u are a good player no one will kick u about cos of lower ilvl
[6:03:17] GTmask: LUL
[6:03:21] cysteicacid: echo players refuse to get 2.4 k pvp even if scripe told they should
[6:03:28] Dyriks: so when is the pvp gear gonna get tagged with (only usable in pvp) Kappa
[6:03:34] mrrazputin: pvp suck top gear should come from raiding not some stupid pvp
[6:03:48] helstrider123: but top gear comes from pve
[6:03:49] Blah206: I have a counter argument though. Aren't there WAY fewer "Top Tier" pvpers? So these guys on Twitch are simply outliers? Not the overwhelming community? Shouldn't they be rewarded for excelling at a part of the game
[6:03:51] pavepawns: its just pvp gear is the fastest and easier to obtain
[6:04:09] Big__Dan__: Who you got today Towelliee?
[6:04:17] D1Chile: @Towelliee main iussue is u should n t have to do pve to get pvp gear and or pvp to get pve gear
[6:04:18] bigb0ngrip: that's what he's saying LUL
[6:04:29] sawnerus: they can still get their gear, i dont get the issue. and the replayability and resubbing comes from the strive to achieve that goal. not farming it mindlessly
[6:04:30] Sneakyy1S: @Skizzurp Ya but the issue now was still that the majority of the playerbase is pve players... Id love to see pvp stats added again to seperate the contents
[6:04:38] burb_berry: Love you @Towelliee
[6:04:43] D1Chile: pvper complained about it for years they should understand the issue
[6:05:10] Rygothx: PVPers don't get that alot of people don't like PVP - it can be too stressful for them, etc. So they prefer PVE.
[6:05:10] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[6:05:20] Blah206: I'm a pvper. What's the problem. Mythic vault should be higher?
[6:05:22] Dragonsland7: Main difference is PVP players get to pick their gear, PVE players get stuck with good old RNG gearing.... not fair IMO
[6:05:31] jourdan_w: I would like a progressive looting system like normal to heroic random dungeons. Where I hit an item level then I’m eligible to loot the next lvl up.
[6:05:40] Shrenko: stepbroher 😳
[6:05:46] Aervyper: @Towelliee i just don't think for your average follower it's hard to understand how HARD it is to get 1400 CR it's so freaking daunting for casuals. Add to that there's nothing really fun in the game to do
[6:05:51] HeIlraiser_: if you are not meta you are not getting into PVP teams @foozer_
[6:05:55] idenkaz_: just look at lfg the M+ anticipation is so low atm
[6:06:05] Blah206: So valor
[6:06:07] Xzero44: wait so they cant go do dungs and learn the game. then start mythic + then do raids ?
[6:06:11] Jay_Vee_NL: also getting 233 gear from pvp is 1000% easier then getting it from mythic raids lol
[6:06:13] MsBlueBunny: XD
[6:06:19] snipsfan: maybe PVE and PVP gear should be completely separate. neither works in the opposite content. maybe you do a quest and get a "base pvp set" and you upgrade it over time with honor and conquest. but pvp gear won't work in pve and pve gear won't work in pvp. could that work?
[6:06:21] Provision_: yeah friend of mine is stuck at 204 for 2 weeks since bad RNG drops, he can't even get a 200+ ilvl weapon evne tho we carry how through raids / mythics + etc
[6:06:21] GodKingMuninn: @Aervyper Not to mention if you took a PvE covenant and are getting shit on by PvP covenants
[6:06:24] bigb0ngrip: yeah but isn't pvp gear less useful for pve or is it same/same
[6:06:31] xRoughneck: That's just my opinion, but I would actually prefer if more loot drops from dungeons instead of a valor vendor.
[6:06:34] Jay_Vee_NL: exactly LUL
[6:06:35] WoW_StandalonE: I like how pvers were shitting on pvper all these years, now when pvper get gear, all pvers are so salty OMEGALUL
[6:06:40] necralia: LUL
[6:06:43] MattyPagey: c) isn't 35 anima
[6:06:55] MsBlueBunny: That's why I started PVP
[6:06:56] Dyriks: LOL
[6:06:56] xRoughneck: I don't like going to a vendor and choosing gear. it takes away the fun of getting a good drop. But that's not happening with current drop rates.
[6:06:56] ZataH: So funny to see all pve players cry so hard now. PVP players was forced to do pve for years to have any chance in pvp
[6:06:56] Marcinek_xP: I love my 35 anima and 75 gold.
[6:06:58] Secondbreakfasttt: i 'm not getting exicted anymore while looting Sire or any other boses!
[6:06:59] Chrisfo79: LUL
[6:07:01] Skizzurp: @snipsfan but people dont want separate systems they want systems that are equal people want to be able to play w/e area they want but still viable in other areas also
[6:07:07] Blah206: pvpers don't get any loot and only 550 conq a week tho ^^
[6:07:09] sawnerus: @Hellraiser_ short of you being a 2400+ mistweaver seeking partners you're doing well enough
[6:07:10] Secondbreakfasttt: i know i aint got shit
[6:07:13] Jay_Vee_NL: this is actually my first expansion i do eveything pvp/M+/raids and i love it :D
[6:07:15] idenkaz_: they get dessert before dessert while everyone else is starving for gear LUL
[6:07:16] bigb0ngrip: that's where legendary crafting comes in you chose what state you want on your gear Jebaited
[6:07:20] Dragonsland7: I'm toking to that brother @Towelliee AMEN
[6:07:25] Lithitus: no 35 anima ...
[6:07:29] Blah206: By less drops, do you mean no re-rolls?
[6:07:31] sawnerus: there should be a badge system though, agreed.
[6:07:32] Sandisy: then you're playing a class that is not meta so it is a struggle to get invites for m+ even with decent io
[6:07:38] LekeroleN: LekeroleN subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 77 months, currently on a 77 month streak! towPurple towHi towHAMUP
[6:07:38] MsBlueBunny: lol 35 anima for a mythic dun 14+
[6:07:39] DigitalChill: it will turn them into non casuals!
[6:07:45] kokoki: Put lower level m+ in dungeon finder to get more people into pushing levels.
[6:07:46] Gopher34: 35 Anima Pog
[6:07:52] cysteicacid: they did it cuz everybody whined aboutt bfa loot party
[6:07:56] RazzeronTV: Went through 3 wings of nathria last night and all i got was anima
[6:07:59] grandmas_good_tuna: I love snorting Anima
[6:07:59] idenkaz_: LUL
[6:07:59] hyvlaar: Well I killed 8 heroic nathria bosses got 8x35 anima Kappa
[6:08:01] Blah206: Isn't the Vault system intended to be the remedy?
[6:08:01] BaldBroGaming: I am sure in Bliz's eyes this was "They want more meaningful loot? Good here is way less of it."
[6:08:02] Molvonos: @Blah206 Rerolls has not a damn thing to do with it. The mobs are dropping less gear as a whole.
[6:08:06] Aervyper: @Towelliee don't forget this.... do Rated BG's and get a weapon ilvl 200, then two weeks later get 1400 rating and level up that item to 207.... lets see a Mythic + item do that
[6:08:06] bigb0ngrip: @kokoki huge agree
[6:08:06] vonblue: some times u don't even get the anima
[6:08:08] mrlazinesslol: chesterfries22 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:08:09] Jasith: I disagree, I like the principle. Loot has been way to abundant. It just feels so much worse when you get 35 anima instead of loot, so the consolation prize has to be bumped for it to work.
[6:08:10] Dyriks: Make the vault magically show up and let you choose what you want LUL
[6:08:25] zaddyZyco: as a casual player i agree, i cant commit to raids, dungeons, bgs, ... so WHEN i can and get some anima. WHY am i casual? I got 2 kids, a job, ... does it mean im not allowed to play and enjoy?
[6:08:29] grapyz: imagine every month they up the Ilvl so your constantly looking for the best piece
[6:08:40] Sneakyy1S: @Towelliee What is your thoughts on pvp stats on gear to seperate the content?
[6:08:45] sawnerus: There should just be a Badge of Justice system again
[6:08:48] sawnerus: simple as
[6:09:08] ZataH: @DreadF0und lol cry more please. If you cant even commit to dungeons or bg, maybe mmorpg is just not for you
[6:09:10] Blah206: Just pvp 4Head
[6:09:12] Sandisy: let there be loot! if someone is "done" with a char people are likely to pick up an alt if it is easy to gear
[6:09:13] kharnij83: u shouldnt complete a 3 chest mythic+ and not get a single piece of loot
[6:09:22] Orthobullet: Add a valor system
[6:09:22] Havykk: Raiding 3 weeks without a single drop = unsub
[6:09:24] jourdan_w: I would like a re roll on the loot table if you miss loot the dungeon before. So every dungeon you do and miss out on, you get a re roll chance on the next for an item.
[6:09:46] bigb0ngrip: can't complain I got a mythic wep, 3 useful legendaries and 2 mythic gear pieces today
[6:09:49] Provision_: I'm on 2 weeks without drops, feel the pain
[6:09:52] D1Chile: @Towelliee imo ppve loot issue is mainly theres no steady progress in loot acquisition for pve casual
[6:09:53] NivedTheBaldKing: upgrade your covenant gear lok
[6:09:53] mrlazinesslol: towHAMUP
[6:09:55] kharnij83: Bring back valor tokens so u at least know i can buy a piece in X amou nt of dungeons
[6:09:55] NivedTheBaldKing: lol
[6:09:57] vonblue: First time my guild went from normal to hc killed the boss after a fuw wipes everyone was feeling good till 3 ppl got useless lot and the rest gold only it was like why did we bother doing this
[6:09:59] cysteicacid: i did 5 mythic booses kill no on item
[6:10:05] qtla: I am still running around with 200 weapons
[6:10:24] Fr33Timer: i stoped playing wow for that reason when you grind it to much time for some loot i takes so much time it gets boring instead of having fun mos ppl unsub for that the games should be fun not like hardwork job
[6:10:24] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:10:30] Skizzurp: people dont want to play a game where they get 1 piece of loot a week lol
[6:10:33] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee With all this useless ass anima I got, maybe they should just let me convert it to conquest -_-
[6:10:35] kharnij83: and bring back Bonus rolls
[6:10:43] GTmask: Raided for 6 weeks both heroic and normal. Got 9 cloaks. too bad I bought the 6months mount + play time. BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[6:10:46] NivedTheBaldKing: just upgrade covenant gear ez lol
[6:10:52] ExigentMidnight: They could let you earn a second piece of vault loot by doing twisting corridors
[6:10:54] MsBlueBunny: lol bonus roll 35 anima
[6:10:58] Provision_: Imagen pushing with your "casual"guild through heroic raiding to not get any decent upgrade. Why would they bother ?
[6:10:59] GrazzloTV: I think it would be cool if legendaries could also drop in the world and also be craftable
[6:11:07] Secondbreakfasttt: @Bluebunnymh YEP!
[6:11:09] snipsfan: I hate to say it but could PUG groups be stopping casuals from pushing M+ and RBGs? maybe a solo que for (lets say m+5) as DPS groups you in and can try and compete key. its same as pug I suppose but I feel like a quick que, and without raider IO getting checked might be better for a Casual. I dunno
[6:11:14] Vadagar1: Thats when the game was brand new. Now its odl
[6:11:19] Artivicii: KEKW
[6:11:22] Madnezz123: LUL
[6:11:22] Artivicii: true
[6:11:26] Syghtless: idk the gearing pace ahs been nice on my main,
[6:11:26] Dragonsland7: Best gear most PVE players have, their legendary?
[6:11:27] wolfieke: people unsub either way tho , other expansions people unsub coz they got the BIS , then unsub till next patch so it doesn't really matter what blizz does tho , people will always unsub between patches
[6:11:34] Secondbreakfasttt: Simple af tho LUL
[6:11:39] Skizzurp: even then tho there were bis stuff u were working for
[6:11:41] kharnij83: 80% of people dont have 8+ jhours to waste runnig raids/dungeons to come out of it with noithing
[6:11:49] D1Chile: @Towelliee bad luck wouldnt work since it would be to complex with multiple ppl in raid to badf luck proitect lol
[6:11:50] Skizzurp: now it just feels like u get nothing all the time
[6:11:53] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee Its sad because my guild has gotten more gear from BoE's than the actual raid.
[6:12:25] Molvonos: lolol, Struggle Bus got more BoE loot drops from our CN raid than from the bosses themselves.
[6:12:59] Aervyper: @Towelliee i'm excited for LOL MMO. Having just started playing LoL everything they seem to do is better than WoW
[6:13:10] Trollhat: what is changing? they are so silent and closed
[6:13:21] Provision_: The fact that I outgeared a friend from doing Mythic + while he doing Mythic raiding is sad
[6:13:23] Cornilya: I think the droploot is cool if you don't get duplicate itmes
[6:13:28] kharnij83: and im not saying wow killers.....but other big name MMOs r coming soon that this might be enough for more casuals to bail faster than normal
[6:13:34] Cornilya: items*
[6:13:34] balderz1: I dunno about the gearing by being slightly casual i found it easy enough to do relatively low level m+ to start gearing maybe being in a guild thats trying to progress into heroic and hopefully mythic help
[6:13:35] Skizzurp: blizz biggest problem isnt admitting something is wrong its fixing it properly and quickly
[6:13:41] WoW_StandalonE: how is running raids a waste of time in wow lol, that's the soul essence on the game lol, ppl r so delusional
[6:13:45] Blah206: Don't worry guys Vicarious Visions is on the job
[6:13:45] unholyhoit: Ghostcrawler working on an MMO again? Does it have frost mages?
[6:13:49] ExigentMidnight: That they did the interview announcing the change with PC Gamer instead of a WoW focused outlet tells you that they're trying to get the message out to casuals that changes are coming
[6:13:49] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee There was also only 1 tier of difficulty in the past... Not 4
[6:13:49] AureliusXV: would you rather grind forgear or a resource?
[6:13:51] vonblue: @towelliee iv already had friends quit the game as they leveled up a toon and then realised there wasn't a clear way to gear properly and hate pop
[6:14:07] Gorestack: what we have now is sure better than M+ shitting all over raiding like last 2 expansions
[6:14:15] svenskavelli: issue is im falling behind raid cos i dont pvp, but im a tank so its gucci
[6:14:18] Provision_: @WoW_StandalonE because what the point doing something if progress give you noting? Yeah it fun for once or 2 times but eventually you want to get rewarded doing it
[6:14:36] GodKingMuninn: yes
[6:14:38] cysteicacid: do u think the loot "bug" in the start of SL wasnt a bug?
[6:14:54] Nightshaft25: so if you want to work hard for your gear go classic not retail LOL
[6:15:10] Warblade23: If u have WM on it is on the same battlegroup yeah
[6:15:14] WoW_StandalonE: @Provision_ I do raids and I get gear, not so much as in the last exp, but Is till do, so your logic is flawed
[6:15:33] snipsfan: I hope the next patch is good, it will tell us alot about the direction they are planning on taking this expansion
[6:15:34] bigb0ngrip: If the game just shit loot for you I'd get so bored.
[6:15:41] cysteicacid: sooo true
[6:15:41] Jay_Vee_NL: exactly the backpaddling andy's LUL

[6:15:48] Provision_: @WoW_StandalonE so since you get gear it fine that other 60% get noting from weekly raiding? The game isn't only about you LUL
[6:15:53] MsBlueBunny: ROFL
[6:15:54] AndreaJonjo: pve can also be a skill game, depends on how you tak eit I guess
[6:15:54] HeIlraiser_: maybe they do have but dont get the chance to find

[6:16:16] ExigentMidnight: Going into arena as a new player and getting curbstomped my meta classes isn't a fun environment to learn in.
[6:16:16] WoW_StandalonE: @Provision_ and not about you, luckily OMEGALUL
[6:16:20] Provision_: @WoW_StandalonE the fact I outgear a mythic raider while i only do heroic raiding and M+ 15 tells a lot
[6:16:29] Armutso: gladiatorlossa tells you when people are blowing cooldowns
[6:16:31] Cochese_: I've played PvP in SL because trinkets were too good and easy to get.
[6:16:33] Jay_Vee_NL: no skill in pve tell that to mythic denathrius @AureliusXV ;)
[6:16:55] Nightshaft25: true that
[6:17:08] svenskavelli: i feel like mythic raiding leadership is the most important, thats from my exp though

[6:18:08] ahies28: you mean gf and wives kill mythic raiding dreams
[6:18:10] bigb0ngrip: does raid finder count?
[6:18:10] Skizzurp: and its even harder for casuals with how extreme people are with meta classes etc for pugs
[6:18:17] snipsfan: honestly I don't think most people step into raid etc
[6:18:22] fistofnature: Where my LFR gang at? BatChest

[6:20:04] wolfieke: it's not guessing , blizzard allready² gave numbers few years ago that even with LFR not even 50 % of players enter raids
[6:20:06] Tessiuz: @Gorestack im sorry bro, you keep watching the streamer and enjoy
[6:20:09] snipsfan: yeah I think most people are not reat super social or what to be committed to a raid team. so they either have to try and pug into bosses or they just don't go in at all
[6:20:29] GodKingMuninn: @jooooker except we can look at how much logged data we have... Then guestimated player population and its GLARING at how small a portion of people even touch normal mode

[6:21:24] Balzofsteels: should be able to add stats like leech or stuff like that with stygia :O
[6:21:24] Aervyper: @Towelliee in my normal guild we are 1/2 way thru normal..... 1/2 the players in the raid don't need a single piece of loot in the raid. The other 1/2 we funnel too. So what do you do?
[6:21:31] FranciscoTheMage: OH PLS
[6:21:35] Blah206: After 2 expansions under Ion. How do we feel about his legacy so far? Kinda odd the PVE director takes over and most of the problems are coming from pve lol.
[6:21:39] Molvonos: @Towelliee They need to legit bring back upgrading PvE via badges within the TF/WF range.
[6:21:40] FranciscoTheMage: we dont mind it? you guys wanted it gone.
[6:21:57] Ergunk: I really enjoyed MoP System with the valor point cap. used the points to upgrade your gear from raid
