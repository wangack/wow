[0:17:32] disnotpeter: but why did he name it to 9 to 5? does that have anything to do with it?
[0:18:25] OnyxLair77: I think Towelman should auction off his old computers for charity!

[0:55:54] faulen: I meant, is that still in the game? Or is just one flying
[0:56:03] doomester: it is but the nerf killed the specc

[0:57:42] HijarL: @towelliee what professions did you choose for the hunter?
[0:58:19] faulen: basically you need to push it 3 times a second to get back the 1 second uptime instead of 2. That's a 40% nerf.
[0:58:24] mmrghost7: paladins and brew are over powered the entire expansion nothing happens , Bdks get good for one patch , burn him down
[0:58:26] Zettabyte: Towel forgot about Twitter, again FeelsBadMan
[0:58:34] Clicklesly: So what you're saying is that BDK nerf made other tanks (apart from prot) more viable Kappa
[0:58:55] Zettabyte: There we go :D
[0:58:59] faulen: @Towelliee it's a 40% nerf.
[0:58:59] doomester: yes
[0:59:05] manmower: no, just means they need to L2P
[0:59:05] doomester: they want to play with BrM
[0:59:07] monute316: yes he said so
[0:59:13] mmrghost7: damage and tankiness
[0:59:25] faulen: no, not dmg. basically you need to push it 3 times a second to get back the 1 second uptime instead of 2. That's a 40% nerf.
[0:59:26] manmower: the BDK was doing as much dmg or more than the dps, was silly
[0:59:27] Dagomarus: id say closer to 33%
[0:59:28] doomester: @Towelliee both dmg and sruvviabvlity
[0:59:29] sifer007: catJAM
[0:59:35] Korupcija_: they will revert the change COPIUM
[1:00:03] mmrghost7: basically Bdks were reliant on their parry chance from DRW to stay alive in high keys
[1:00:16] Dagomarus: id be happy with just a damage nerf
[1:00:18] Zynrok_: BDK always get nerfed when they good :P
[1:00:19] reggiepowa: blood dk is doing way too much dmg
[1:00:27] Zettabyte: Need a towCopium emote, and towHopium Kappa
[1:00:28] faulen: yeah, without it, you are a wet noodle
[1:00:33] manmower: their defenses were too good as well
[1:00:40] PvtHudson093: Mike Tyson is going to kill Jake Paul
[1:00:42] N3llee: @Towelliee I know your in WoW mode but did you hear Lost Ark/Amazon banned VPN's in an effort to stim botting. Sucks that legit players are caught up in it. The active player count on steam dropped 125k last night during peak time.
[1:00:50] Unwary: ***fun detected*** "time for a nerf"

[1:02:18] newkingcody: BibleThump
[1:02:20] 210Crawler: Did they ban people with VPN services?
[1:02:29] mmrghost7: i mean its the end of expansion why cant just blizzard let us have a good time

[1:02:49] Jarlan23: i wish they would put more effort into their buffs/nerfs. like a 4% buff to arms doesnt really do anything
[1:02:59] Dagomarus: yeah its only really an issue in 19+ or higher id say
[1:03:00] manmower: was preventing people from wanting to take other tanks in pugs
[1:03:04] Jarlan23: and they've been doing these aura buffs since bfa as far as i know
[1:03:09] Clicklesly: Tbh i was more surprised there was no dps nerfs included in this ^^

[1:04:33] Korupcija_: not sure why they're trying to balance competitive stuff where you take the best stuff anyway
[1:04:38] Dagomarus: well naowh sounds like he is going to switch to different tank if this nerf happends

[1:05:15] stabzmcgeee: @faulen well the nerffs arent in yet  so its still strongest
[1:05:25] Fangy_Playz: poor druids haven't been great in quite some time..
[1:05:27] doomester: its fine to nerf dps not survivablity
[1:05:31] faulen: @stabzmcgeee yep, you're right
[1:05:37] Fangy_Playz: Hopefully that changes in Dragonflight.
[1:05:45] CritcobainTV: wait what nerfs? someone link
[1:05:55] stabzmcgeee: @faulen didnt see your second msg, ignore me :p
[1:06:01] Dagomarus: its just sad to nerf us, just let us have fun and buff other tanks too
[1:06:13] Fangy_Playz: Bless you
[1:06:31] mmrghost7: i saw a seem on nerfed version , 2.6k dmg decrease just on a single target
[1:06:34] mmrghost7: sim

[1:06:58] lilwaldo: towOny towOny
[1:07:36] mmrghost7: excatly
[1:07:40] manmower: BDK weren't too strong in retail compared to others?
[1:07:48] reggiepowa: I dont think it was just mdi, bdk was surviving stuff that other tanks have no way of surviving
[1:07:55] reggiepowa: in regular keys
[1:07:58] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee with Lost Ark banning VPN's you think that will affect their China players? alot of China players use VPN's
[1:07:58] mmrghost7: bunch of min maxer going nuts = every Bdk must pay for that
[1:08:09] Fangy_Playz: So i'm a level 34 brew i'm assuming it's just Keg Smash, Fire breath blackout kick rinse repeat as a rotation?

[1:13:47] haggis_chaser: mdi is in 3 hours
[1:13:56] TomReforged: @TomReforged I guess the reason I ask is that Warlock had a nerf and people said the same thing. I mean aren't some classes way overpowered in WoW or nahh?
[1:14:01] kay0234: There is mainteance on monday @Towelliee  as well
[1:14:02] manmower: when did 9.2 release? think we'll be in this awhile

[1:15:03] manmower: do they have to make the changes live on the MDI servers?
[1:15:04] Fensmarken: @Towelliee I mean they'll probably just keep the change off the tournament realm

[1:22:31] crizby_89: for someone just coming back to Wow after over a year and change thats a fresh 60 hunter, where should i start? Should i just run dungeons for gear?

[3:53:56] N3llee: feel like we read two differrent info about the earning call. I read it was basically the worst numbers in blizz histroy
[3:53:59] GamerKillance: True enough, but I think it was a lot of the hardcore raiding people that left over the lawsuit. Least i think they were looking for an excuse to take a break lol
[3:54:00] crittinkitten: who knows
[3:54:05] TheItalianStallion321: his title says P5 prog, not P3

[3:55:27] GamerKillance: Ultimate fights are loooooooooooong
[3:55:42] Eraste: i definitely prefer ff14 now over wow, as a filthy casual. nothing fun in wow to do but i hope professions and dragon riding change that
[3:55:47] fillefaren: man im so excited for the new expansion, i really do hope its gonna be good
[3:55:55] Coffins85: You tend to find small differences in the strats that make a big difference and also comps matter a lot.
[3:56:08] IianaDRK: its like a boss rush
[3:56:18] crittinkitten: The world first progression is similar to wow in how they work things out. Guess they just feel they don't want to give other teams a way to catch up with them if they get stuck later.
[3:56:21] IianaDRK: the new thing with this 1 tho is theres checkpoints

[3:56:56] TheItalianStallion321: mid-fight you start in p2 instead of p1
[3:56:59] TheItalianStallion321: or something like that
[3:57:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: fight probably still has a 2 hour timer
[3:57:17] Charliex302: i just got back i took a hiatus got insanely burned out last year right when sylvanas raid came out its so cool seeing all these different specs on top in mythic+
[3:57:21] crittinkitten: Checkpoints are per lockout. so you have to reclear on a new lockout. And FF raid lockouts last an hour
[3:57:22] IianaDRK: considering theyre like 18-20 minute fights yeh checkpoints are welcome lol
[3:57:42] TheItalianStallion321: right, if you use the whole 2 hour time limit, you have to start the fight all over again

[5:14:11] Aidler: @chrslp true they do this all the time
[5:14:23] chrslp: With GFuel showing up more and more in stores, it'd be a perfect time for WoW to do another drink deal. Who remembers the Horde and Alliance mountain dew?

[5:17:04] mmrghost7: do u think we will see talent trees before alpha ?
[5:17:15] chrslp: As they grow I would expect to start seeing tubs in stores but theres so many flavors I doubt any store wants to take up shelves with 50 flavors
[5:17:39] brewgamingtv: yeah they want them out before alpha to get feedback
[5:17:47] jfmons: hey rob, is this the life or what?
[5:17:55] Clicklesly: I thought they even said they're posting them before the alpha is out

[5:24:45] Nokterian: yeah for now
[5:25:05] fred_birkhoff: technology ...
[5:25:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: techically sunwell has to be unlocked after doing some dalies
[5:25:16] thepaladinjournal: is this on a new bnet, because otherwise you should have had the soulbinds unlocked already because of catch up
[5:25:24] bc_23_: its not new
[5:25:30] N3llee: We dont know
[5:25:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: dont see why not
[5:25:34] N3llee: they have not confirmed

[5:25:51] N3llee: but it is assumed to be releasing jsust like it did orginally
[5:26:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess they might speed up the unlocking for Sunwell, yeah
[5:27:10] Armdel: i was sold when they confirmed a PC version
[5:27:21] ChrisStoll: I'm going to give immortal a shot. Just something to play until dragonflight

[5:28:58] chrslp: Not a huge difference
[5:29:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: It could make a ton of cash, yeah
[5:29:09] MerffTV: Depends on what kind of game...if it's an autobattler, it will be a money printer. If it's Pokeman Go, it's dead n arrival.
[5:29:30] Nokterian: Kleia is bae
