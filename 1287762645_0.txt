[1:31:26] dalaraz: why would oyu play paladin if you wanna be top dps though
[1:31:38] swordart_19: @poondog it is called healers

[1:32:40] CrimsonNurse: I am struggling between Striker and Bard
[1:32:43] swordart_19: Content creators said x so true what a nonsense
[1:32:50] nelorixx: I mean they are meant to be supports
[1:32:58] nelorixx: or am I wrong?
[1:33:04] CDubTheRIPper: pikaOMG
[1:33:08] swordart_19: is there even dmg meter in game?
[1:33:23] Cerbrus0: @swordart_19 no
[1:33:26] Sielu11628: This new leak on mmo-c is very interesting https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2614590-World-of-Warcraft-Ashes-of-Galakaros. A bit too detailed though. Sounds amazing though!
[1:33:29] Tyrou: no damage meter
[1:33:38] swordart_19: @cerbrus0 so they make stuff from their ass
[1:33:44] Xanigh: i guess it's like playing disc priest and sayig they wanna just dps
[1:33:45] dalaraz: no meter but you can say if some class does low dps if you hav eplayed the game
[1:33:47] Tyrou: but the bosses definitely have a dps check
[1:33:55] swordart_19: So of you MVP you are fine.
[1:33:59] lithium364: the worst part about the leaks would be the actual expansion beein worse then any leak
[1:34:29] swordart_19: @dalaraz how sounds like nonsense
[1:34:34] Tyrou: @swordart_19 the only reason paladin/bard will ever get MVP is if they are supporting more than anything because they have to heal the group more than dps
[1:34:38] SpoofAvatar: so many 'Ret' paladins will be crying
[1:34:42] BirdzFlyinHi: BirdzFlyinHi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! i leveled a dwarf to 22 before i realized it was a gnome. Month 1 of WoW for me lmao Have a great dat everyone

[1:35:16] Cerbrus0: @mizuryo kinda
[1:35:24] SpoofAvatar: support is support
[1:35:30] dalaraz: @swordart_19 if you have played all the classes,like those people,you need no meter to see what does more or lower damage
[1:35:33] Tyrou: @mizuryo heals/shields
[1:35:38] swordart_19: @birdzflyinhi OMEGALUL put glasses on xZ
[1:35:43] Xanigh: Is there a respecc in Lost Ark?
[1:35:58] swordart_19: @dalaraz well I believe math not guessing
[1:36:07] khannom4: so what's the best dps ? xd
[1:36:07] BirdzFlyinHi: @swordart_19 hahaha
[1:36:09] CanadianCataclysm: So how come the change of Lost Ark servers from Regulus to Una?
[1:36:12] PToastman: if support is mandatory for high end content, why is there only two support classes?
[1:36:25] dalaraz: @swordart_19 who says its guessing ? they see the numbers
[1:36:31] KaisenSiru: slootYEP
[1:36:34] idleswede: @swordart_19 There are like 7 or 8 criteria to get MVP. DPS is just one of them
[1:36:48] Cerbrus0: @khannom4 the game is very well balanced, but sorc is a bit ahead in terms of dps

[1:36:57] dalaraz: pepe :p
[1:37:04] manmower: what's team arkasia?
[1:37:05] Tyrou: Again if a support gets MVP it is because they are healing not because of their damage done
[1:37:07] shobolt1980: do u think next patch will change the game completely/? and we ll wee a nea game?

[2:06:49] dalaraz: it was both than either @Towelliee
[2:07:05] Yogoda: @towelliee what server are you going to play lost ark on?

[2:07:40] swordart_19: @rudenucklehead Will be on launcher news
[2:07:51] swordart_19: @rudenucklehead otherwise nope

[2:12:17] iitsmadness: mostly ppl buy them for the 3 day headstart
[2:12:18] The1ceCream: will you do all side quests and collect all mokoko seeds?
[2:12:35] jin_sensei: Ok - I checked the list of objectives. Since it was made by Saintone - the dude knew what he was doing. Level 53 is fairly difficult to achieve - it takes a bit of time. Lvl 50 tower of shadows depends on skill - after floor 24 it becomes challenging . Island Hearts takes a bit of time - not hard . Same for 100% Adventure Book. And the PVP is pure skill
[2:12:45] TheUnknowing: I want to play the game just dont have the extra money to spend on a pack right now, so will be waiting til the 11th
[2:12:54] trevomancho: @Towelliee only the bronze and platinum are worth the money im not saying the mield ones are scam

[2:13:22] dalaraz: why are they scam? you get the currency worth
[2:13:26] Rudenucklehead: Don’t you think trying to put the second Lego under a rep gate after they said they wouldn’t would have saved them quite a bit of time?

[2:13:34] BirdzFlyinHi: new world obliterated all that
[2:13:57] jin_sensei: It takes a bit of time to get the hang of PVP and understanding how CC works in game

[2:14:58] realnzall: Are they still going to block the game from Belgian players?
[2:15:01] jin_sensei: @KragnosWoW but yes - he goes EU West
[2:15:11] jin_sensei: @realnzall yes
[2:15:13] KragnosWoW: @jin_sensei he said hes going NA West Mari or Valtan
[2:15:43] jin_sensei: @KragnosWoW yes - he said that - but most of the community is EU over 50% . And around 20% US that goes mostly to EU east - some west
[2:15:47] jin_sensei: NA East*
[2:16:08] dalaraz: theres no eu east or west :p typos prolly ?
[2:16:09] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!

[2:17:03] swordart_19: @akia03 wut
[2:17:08] KragnosWoW: based off how important ping is in a game like league of legends which is highly click to move and ping reliant, i just think west is the move for me. 20 ping sounds so nice
[2:17:16] Sollice: @akia03 A lot? I think its only 2 countries

[2:18:32] maustercheese: that sounds weird
[2:18:35] dalaraz: they should have 1 oceanic server to get those people in there
[2:18:39] itscoffeecup: @swordart_19 yeah make new characters, but i want to be able to just play one.
[2:18:46] an_optimist: Ahh thought you already started the leveling challenge you were talking about -- you decide on a name?
[2:18:48] jin_sensei: yes - Saintone made the Legends of Arkesia
[2:19:37] swordart_19: @selectrons what stops you?Do campaign once skip on Alta then choose PvP or PvE or both for vault lvl and go play next.
[2:19:44] Brodih_: lol you actually passed the 99% mark @Towelliee
[2:20:02] jin_sensei: idk - i hope you guys enjoy the game. I enjoyed it on RU and 100% will enjoy it on west. Its a good mmorpg - and we are getting the best version of Lost Ark aswell...

[2:20:36] itscoffeecup: @swordart_19 :D <3
[2:20:51] Sollice: Thats ok though. I like not having everything unlocked at first, gives us stuff to look forward to

[2:21:03] Sollice: Yeah I agree @jin_sensei

[2:21:09] Phantomstrk: ya gotta wonder if the dev's are messing with ya now on purpose lol
[2:21:16] jin_sensei: @Sollice and it is season 2... Even more than that . We have QoL and updates faster than RU or JP
[2:21:17] Kinghorn: yeah we would know 100%

[2:27:53] swordart_19: Even prepatch was 100% YEP
[2:27:56] aramhere: ty ty ty
[2:28:13] dracullus: Jaina farms were pretty popular
[2:28:18] swordart_19: You will pug it by then I plugged jaiana like that
[2:28:31] swordart_19: *pugged
[2:28:34] swordart_19: Yeee
[2:28:38] Sielu11628: WoW: Eclipse
[2:28:38] c0mmander_starscream: #FuckJana
[2:28:43] dalaraz: gear made jaina run way trivial
[2:28:43] KaisenSiru: Unfortunately
[2:28:44] c0mmander_starscream: I hate jana
[2:28:48] k3i3ool: +  good skip
[2:28:56] Kinghorn: the jaina cheese strat was so easy
[2:28:56] jetributions: what up
[2:28:58] Stall1: I bought it but I killed it with my guild too
[2:29:12] mavericks312: noone wants to run a 15 minute fight over and over lol
[2:29:14] dalaraz: sylvanas fight aint ment to pug even when overgeared
[2:29:40] GermanBacon: depending on how much damage we have at the end of 9.2, Sylvy might be kinda easy
[2:30:00] mavericks312: i will say the sylvanas mount is the best dragonhawk mount
[2:30:08] GermanBacon: true
[2:30:09] Kinghorn: oh did you see they found a cheese strat for archimonde in classic. you can stack all the ranged under a tree root and they never need to move
[2:30:28] Stall1: Guess Im gonna have to farm the mount in 11.0
[2:30:46] Stall1: 11.2/3*
[2:30:50] Kinghorn: you get knocked up into the root and the fire never reaches you for some reason
[2:31:03] Kinghorn: LUL
[2:31:14] dalaraz: sylvanas will be weird to solo farm in the future
[2:31:24] dalaraz: even if possible to solo
[2:31:27] Keyastaron_: night hold @Towelliee
[2:31:30] swordart_19: @kinghorn lol sound like bug
[2:31:32] Keyastaron_: w guldan
[2:31:33] Phantomstrk: will the mount still drop from her in future
[2:31:37] subversv: you need the cape for n'zoth
[2:31:49] Phantomstrk: ahh...gotcha..thx
[2:31:55] Jaqhuir: i think they will make it desolate host from tomb
[2:31:57] madtrade2600: i want to solo argus for sooo long
[2:32:04] Kinghorn: even with the changes argus on mythic can still be a close dps race
[2:32:11] dalaraz: now that i think of it,sylvanas wont be soloable by how the fight is
[2:32:21] Angelocastro10: how much does sylvanas mount goes for?
[2:32:26] Stall1: I will probably buy it if its less than 500k at some point
[2:32:47] dalaraz: doubt it will go so low stall1
[2:32:55] subversv: LUL yeah right
[2:33:08] akia03: just sylv hc kill is 60k
[2:33:11] Buckwink: it does because asmongold was getting silenced all the time for nothing

[2:46:55] Spaede: Our guild is all getting banned/silenced right now for m+/raid sales
[2:46:58] Spaede: It’s horrible
[2:47:35] Spaede: The silence reason is “language” it’s ridiculous
[2:47:41] dalaraz: you cant counter it without active moderators checking
[2:47:52] swordart_19: @spaede appeal
[2:47:53] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee why cant they take a look at the group finder and see them?
[2:47:58] iitsmadness: honestly group finder advertising should be banned and only allowed in trade chat
[2:48:07] Spaede: @swordart_19 we are, it’s just a slow process
[2:48:15] dalaraz: reporting is fine,automated punishment is the issue imo
[2:48:23] Scoodles91: a guilde was silanced for trying to recruit ppl to the guild :D
[2:48:27] Vadagar1: I think alot of people don't really understand what the rules are.
[2:48:29] swordart_19: @spaede well is weekend unlucky
[2:48:39] Alepouditsa: yes coz the don't know if what the person sells it legit or not
