[0:15:24] Deli94: !936p
[0:15:25] StreamElements: @Deli94, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.

[1:08:40] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[1:25:47] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[3:13:20] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.
[3:13:21] Graffbox: @theWolfBionic Yeah it's refreshing, I'm new to PC so was a learning curve for sure. Mates just got a PC too so probably tag along with him and feel a bit safer haha

[4:04:25] StreamElements: @ItsAzvix, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
