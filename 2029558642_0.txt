[1:19:38] Doge: i've done over 30 raids between 4 chars and haven't seen the sword one time lol

[1:19:41] yarrpeter: Sword is a little higher than the staff. not much
[1:19:42] bronchoped1: Sword seems to be fairly common

[1:20:21] Ellie_theMarmot: @tatzu_u sole and crewshop
[1:20:28] Guts__TV: @SONII i think people will continually farm it into next phase due to how strong it is since itll be pre-bis for the lvl 40 raid

[3:05:49] angryhatter: wotlk is still fun
[3:05:50] karrots96: I feel like Blizzard created SoD as a innovation sand box and hired a small team of devs to develop the game like its a startup. Love how active they've been with public feedback
[3:05:50] jschroe3: this is peak streamer bennies lol
[3:05:55] SamDavidsin: i dont think so.. doesnt something like that have to be patched, they cant make cretain loot drop on the fly live

[3:06:55] B1oobear: Idk about wotlk the pvp is kind of unbalanced in terms of gearing and not really a fan of dks
[3:07:00] Golden_Snack: but 2s are insta 3s also
[3:07:02] Cjpriest: @Dopey the devs that make SoD are beyond passionate about it and theres only 8 of them. With the amount of success its seem so far you dont know whats coming next

[3:43:30] bronchoped1: It's fun though. For content
[3:43:42] Cjpriest: the whole idea of SoD hardcore IN MY OPINION is dumb
[3:43:42] StandardOut: Personally. HC is what has me back in this community.
[3:43:45] HideLemonsYo: no lie, sod hc is popular cause phase 1 has taken forever

[3:44:44] bronchoped1: Was a smart idea. Still a long time to kill
[3:44:50] StandardOut: When you can just die and go again is ruins the RP aspect. IMO
[3:44:59] Wavy_Sinatra: xaryu didnt take handouts on his mage
[3:45:02] hypnoidal: will you reroll SoD HC so it’s good for phase 2?

[6:07:37] Darkaon: facts
[6:07:47] RedChaosTV: i would think most men are in love with some girls before they even say hello
[6:07:49] anuel214: even then you still do
[6:07:49] TobyNova: yeh for real
[6:07:52] KonQel: my ex pulled a knife on me LUL does that count as crazy enough
[6:07:54] khitomer: its a lottery, you dont get to find out if theres a deeper bond until the brain's love chemicals wear off after 3 years.
[6:07:55] Hdhyper: I've had destroyers but i still reflect and care hard
[6:07:58] don_kneee: TRUEEEE
[6:07:58] Flitzpipm: idk
[6:07:59] escadaily: do you think your ex is watching your stream rn
[6:08:01] gen7lem4n: men are like dogs loyal strong love, women are like cats, you know what I mena
[6:08:02] lighto2910: very true

[6:08:09] iPlayCuzFun: it hurts the most seeing an EX that is down bad....and there's nothing u can do about it because u know where it leads
[6:08:12] anuel214: oh yeah with out a doubt lol they can turn it off asap
[6:08:16] clickaqt: I think men forgive people easier
[6:08:18] escadaily: would be kinda nice if she would
[6:08:25] putt_aus: women dont need men really thats the difference, a lot of men rely on women
[6:08:26] cloutzor: isnt it like a survival trait women have
[6:08:28] KonQel: ye dont
[6:08:28] jwlindl: your barbell brigade video with xar was where i found ya. i think it lead me down a rabbit hole of fitness youtube and eventually a gym membership
[6:08:30] R3ga1: I do vouch for my ex's safety but like I don't linger on it longer
[6:08:32] sleepytempest: my ex flushed a baked potato down the toilet. will never forget her
[6:08:37] khitomer: the worst is getting a chick with BPD because youve been conditioned to equate love with pain by a BPD mom
[6:08:38] karrots96: girls get a tremendous amount of support from eachother and so that helps them a lot get over their ex's sooner
[6:08:38] Boopermans: she ate your peanutbutter didnt she

[6:09:13] TobyNova: We got each other <3
[6:09:24] Ghalvz: holy shit who is that young man
[6:09:24] Shepp22: things can be so complicated. I’m very laid back, almost too much at certain times. my girl has like 2 days of good ones, then 1 day of a bad one. she tells me exactly that. but I try to be so supportive of that one day
[6:09:25] Fierceee: You look 14

[6:10:42] bede232: Neither ours. But just a bit of food and bit of gym
[6:10:46] iPlayCuzFun: the thing about being "famous" is that everything u do is exciting for the viewers

[6:11:14] MichiE46: the gym streams sadg
[6:11:16] raw_o: streaming is like gigchad vlogging'

[6:12:51] KonQel: Dogs are too good for us
[6:12:53] dBoyAdams: Its bitter sweet, happy to see them out of pain but i mean the reality is that they were your best friend & you were there whole world.
[6:12:58] frontenwow: I can relate to that. We had to put my family dog down last summer, and i was spending the weekend in the summer house with it just before - 3 days later he refuses to move, so we knew... But the trauma will never rly go
[6:12:59] betterdayz1996: I had a dog named nikita look just like yours!
[6:13:01] ghostbagster: Death is a part of life ppl needs to get used to it
[6:13:07] spoonyb4rd: Dude it's so sad. My first dog aside from our family dog had a nasty aggressive mast cell that we thought was going to take our dog. Just got through it post-thanksgiving. He's healed and it was a low grade mast cell with tons of inflammation.
