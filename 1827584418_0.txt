[1:02:32] ezscaping: If they rebalance stuff too that could be incredible
[1:03:06] PaEu: Most important thing is to remove decay. Its toxic to not be able to take breaks.
[1:03:41] TheEndIsNear777: decay is too much per week
[1:03:51] Deathleta: Agreed
[1:04:09] TheEndIsNear777: yea
[1:04:11] Visionate: Ye
[1:04:13] TrioDeFo: I would tbh becasue otherwise I won't be pvp'ing rofl
[1:04:13] comfortuk: whats the point of getting pvp gear tho
[1:04:23] PaEu: kinda takes the point of hardcore away, its not meant for bgs
[1:04:29] Grez_1: No one would be left alive eventually
[1:04:31] Deathleta: Would be an interesting twist
[1:04:48] TrioDeFo: Its the best gear in game pretty much rank 14
[1:04:57] nympheteminefix: who could reliably pvp in hardcore if 1 death in a bg you lose your character.  would make the pvp scene basically empty
[1:05:02] Avg_Everything: BGs would be just like 4 classes with the most survivability
[1:05:31] Pallyofhell: pvp will be full of druids and rogues
[1:05:36] Pallyofhell: just to stealth
[1:05:42] SilkeySmooth: there are big updates coming to classic era pvp honor rankings
[1:05:44] JuggaBugga: ayee lvl 13 noiceee
[1:05:50] ItsCulby: Where I finally got back in and didnt die
[1:06:07] SilkeySmooth: @Swifty did you see the blue post abotu classic era pvp?
[1:06:07] TheEndIsNear777: i hope they update pvp gear too, and add phases to pvp gear
[1:06:09] biingb0ng: permanent deaths pvp related should only happen 1v1 in a duel to the death
[1:06:18] comfortuk: have you ever got rank 14?
[1:06:21] PaEu: I feel like hardcore is about the PvE not PvP, so i woulodnt get my hopes up
[1:06:28] lethalstick: what if they make it so u can q for pvp  only after u hit lvl 60 and if u die in bg u cant rez
[1:07:39] SilkeySmooth: all the bgs will be linked so i doubt blizzard will let yout chr die in a bg from some one from another server
[1:08:09] comfortuk: @Swifty  have you ever got rank 14?
[1:08:22] TrioDeFo: If they did that tho and they made pvp deaths not count then people would be just doing pvp to 60 so they don't have to risk starting over....

[1:08:50] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:08:56] PaEu: They should make a unique PvP sytem of hardcore. PvP shouldnt be perma death, but you should be able to loot 1 player from the person you kill. Open world PvP only
[1:09:08] Encarved: sup swifty
[1:09:28] roadkill3s: make rank 14 where you have to get a certain number of HC kills on players
[1:09:35] TrioDeFo: I just think it wouldn't work that way cause if the pvp deaths didn't count then people wouldn't even wanna risk starting over
[1:09:49] TrioDeFo: and would level to cap doing pvp

[1:09:58] PaEu: Yeah so if you kill someone you could loot an item from them
[1:10:05] SilkeySmooth: what if classic pvp gets tbc and wraths honor system?
[1:10:09] shaunmachine: If you do bg in hardcore, does it matter if you due
[1:10:41] Pallyofhell: thats what ill be doing
[1:10:45] Aldever13: griefing is risky in official hc servers
[1:11:03] SilkeySmooth: only alliance get griefed liek that
[1:11:05] Digmadness: :D
[1:11:07] TheEndIsNear777: maybe they can limit the cap of honor per day to 50k, if you hit 50k per day for a period of time you are guaranteed rank 14 but you don't go against other people's grind just the limit set per day by blizz

[1:49:55] lysdexic__: 2 reasons, their greed and their incompetence to ban gold sellers/buyers... instead of hiring actual GMs they sell gold themselves...
[1:50:02] TactileCurve: 10k now
[1:50:07] very__legal: Retail has tokens and there’s still bots there they just want more money
[1:50:10] shaggy462: i think blizzard are 100% expecting hardcore to be big on launch, so most people would be playing that over wrath i think
[1:50:13] metii_98: in Eu 11.5 Today

[2:54:29] delirious555: 55 shaman death WutFace
[2:54:30] Safty: There's also really gnarly casters over by the BS and in the keep that will stomp you and I think they heal or silence if i remember right
[2:54:37] Renlowe_: HC > Retail

[2:55:55] Teagens: @Renlowe_
[2:56:01] tron3kk: @Teagens LUL
[2:56:09] Safty: @Teagens they're just different games <3
[2:56:11] Teagens: xD
[2:57:00] phatcarboholic: Swifty I saw you try a rogue and a Druid did u just not like those classes or did u die?
[2:57:09] woche0392: Especially knowing when to sheep a resisted mob.  That can be a killer if not done right.
[2:57:10] Safty: I will say this though, Teagens, once i started private servers I wasn't really ever able to enjoy retail gain. that was during the Jaina raid in bfa
[2:57:53] thornclaw80: You can aoe farm now  with arcane explosion right at the groll farm your next to the field pull 3 at a time
[2:58:03] Safty: Hunter is probably faster than mage in HC
[2:58:13] Cowardpatty: Hunter is 100% faster than mage
[2:58:29] phatcarboholic: Gotcha - hunter crazy fast too but aoe mage BiS
[2:58:32] 4nothin: so u can pvp on hardcore?
[2:58:33] Litespd: That’s way to risky to aoe at this level on hc
[2:58:35] Djinx_o: This is the way
[2:58:38] Chosey: monkaS
[2:58:40] Safty: Yeah

[2:58:55] Safty: my first hc 60 was a hunter
[2:58:57] Aldever13: thats a rare
[2:59:00] Chosey: only 13
[2:59:08] Teagens: @Safty That's fair. Lot of people felt uninspired by BFA. PErsonally, I love Retail more than Classic and find more enjoyment out of new content then old, rehashed. Although, Hardcore is fun and the communtiy for it is great.
[2:59:08] komunalec: go for it
[2:59:09] woche0392: You can kill him
[2:59:12] Djinx_o: you're a mage now, you can take him :P
[2:59:15] Chosey: kite with frost bolt and nova
[2:59:19] solsaver12: hahaha go for it
[2:59:24] plarii: mage op you got this

[3:00:26] tron3kk: not lifers DansGame
[3:00:28] Safty: If you get classic bestiary it will allow you to ctrl hover over mobs and see the abilities they cast. That way you don't get surprised by like, an execute or somethin or a thorns aura ya know?
[3:00:30] fero_cp: Hello swifty good vibes, one question, have you tried the Rested xp addon? It helps a lot for guidance

[3:05:18] tron3kk: nice payoGa
[3:05:27] 4nothin: what 2 professions
[3:05:37] Safty: It's crazy dude. Like in theory aoe farming is chill and fast. In reality, you get mobs resisting every couple of pulls, you gotta sheep, kite, it gets crazy. Like on a successful pull you're at like 20% life haha
[3:06:09] Safty: In softcore that's whatever, but in HC going under 20% causes mistakes a lot of the time cause of panic
[3:06:19] younglettuc: Hc hype hc hypeeee

[3:07:27] Safty: But once you get yellow and orange mobs you start getting a lot of resists on your novas
[3:07:27] solsaver12: HC you gotta be aware of everythikng
[3:07:55] wowjumper: i literally didnt know you got married
[3:07:56] Safty: That's where going Eng is a really good idea, cause when you get those nova resists you can drop a dummy or a bomb and reset the stack

[3:21:05] Majeye: @delirious555 There isn't much hype for blizzard games in general lately.  I think gamers are getting tired of being stung by this company.
[3:21:10] actually_pierce: diablo isn't about PvP and it's for the better

[3:42:24] OleTex: You can get 10 out of your mana pull
[3:42:25] Cowardpatty: Good way to OOM
[3:42:30] Djinx_o: If you can kille 1, you can kill 10 :P :D
[3:42:32] OleTex: So its about 320-340 damage
[3:42:32] nashonatorrr: you can you go omm
[3:42:41] snakedoctor76: You'll go oom spamming AE
[3:42:42] solsaver12: ya takes alot of mana
[3:42:43] OleTex: sorry 320-370 damage
[3:42:51] thornclaw80: No go back to the farm where those mages were
[3:42:53] OleTex: 10 globals
[3:42:57] Driftymedusa: hey swifty how are you doing
[3:43:14] Ashmeh: tbh i love the voiceovers for quests, makes it less grindy in my mind
[3:43:15] OverCraftX: thornclaw80 how many levels and time did you made in aoe there ?
[3:43:32] hungweilogaming: he spawns super fast
[3:43:36] Hot_Sauce_Ross: you can get clearcasting then improved arcane explosion which adds +6% crit to AE. the clearcasting helps with OOM
[3:43:37] hungweilogaming: the other mobs are easy there
[3:43:55] Djinx_o: EZ :O
[3:43:56] thornclaw80: That has more HP than the other mobs at that farm
[3:44:19] thornclaw80: Go back to that farm
[3:44:21] OverCraftX: lets go to the farm haha
[3:44:27] Djinx_o: easy now, try with 2-4 mobs first :P
[3:44:29] snakedoctor76: I can't see any way this could go bad
[3:44:35] OleTex: Your frost nova will do 21-24 to each mob as well
[3:44:36] Aldever13: careful
[3:44:53] Djinx_o: @snakedoctor76 true LUL
[3:44:56] thornclaw80: Go back to the farm Swifty
[3:45:01] HighThereBud: RIP
[3:45:13] thornclaw80: Yes
[3:45:14] Aldever13: 2 at a time though, must be careful
[3:45:17] Aldever13: or 3
[3:45:23] OverCraftX: skip bears and go farm haha
[3:45:25] thornclaw80: The farm they grolls on
[3:45:30] solsaver12: buff yerself  lol
[3:45:49] OverCraftX: if you nova them, they dont attack yo
[3:45:50] solsaver12: lol
[3:45:54] nashonatorrr: Engineering makes it a little easier with bombs. and they stun too
[3:45:59] tron3kk: crazyjpnHAPPY

[3:46:03] Deathleta: LUL like a kid in a candy store
[3:46:04] eisenlarry2: POGGERS
[3:46:05] thornclaw80: Do you have to go back to the farm they have less Hp
[3:46:10] CommanderRudolph: Tip would be to frost nova, and them jump while you arcane explosion to have a longer range on the explosion
[3:46:12] snakedoctor76: Round them up, nova and AE at range
[3:46:13] HighThereBud: @solsaver12 his monitor is ultrawise so hard to see the buff lol
[3:46:17] Aldever13: clip this someone lol
[3:46:20] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[3:46:21] thornclaw80: Also use frost nova and stand back
[3:46:21] OleTex: Yeah nova 1 then arcane XD
[3:46:24] Cowardpatty: I'll clip it when he dies
[3:46:29] nashonatorrr: no you can stun them
[3:46:41] EnvieB: 7 ads?
[3:46:43] EvoCyberNation: He loves his new monitor  :)  He was showing it off the other night.
[3:47:08] OverCraftX: xDD
[3:47:14] tron3kk: @EnvieB i only get 10 DansGame
[3:47:25] CommanderRudolph: If you jump and Arcane Explosion in the air, it will get a longer range due to "Z-axis" in Vanilla
[3:47:30] OverCraftX: go to the farm please haha
[3:47:34] shinshin_lurk: Guys, is it rare to have the arena trinket (gurubashi) on hc char ?
[3:47:34] quenzar: Lol you look like a kid in a candy store 😆
[3:48:08] thornclaw80: I wouldn’t lol
[3:48:17] thewetsprocket: no frost is betta
[3:48:23] thornclaw80: No I personally would go back to the farm
[3:48:36] CommanderRudolph: It will allow you to get 1-2 more explosions off from the nova before they hit you (as long as you nova and walk away ofcourse).

[3:49:15] hungweilogaming: hyperspawn trap
[3:49:17] Safty: Dude what are you doing
[3:49:19] Safty: Get out of there
[3:49:24] CommanderRudolph: I gotta head to bed - EU times. You just took me way back, felt like I had to pay a little back after 10 years of lurking ahaha, you're amazing. Cheerio!
[3:49:24] prais_gg: What happened to the decoration?
[3:49:28] SmizeGuy: 2 raiders from SmizeGuy have joined! 
[3:49:39] thornclaw80: Just go back to the farm grind out till 18 it only take you about an hour if you pull 3 to 4 mobs at a time
[3:49:49] Safty: are you just trying to farm shackles?
[3:49:53] Creampuff1112: Skinning in cave´s are dangerous since it makes em respawn faster
[3:50:07] Kingconn223: how do you feel about WoW tokens in wrath now?
[3:50:18] Safty: Oh, go to barrens
[3:50:18] quenzar: Good point Cream

[3:51:32] WarmWetTight: you mean hardcore?
[3:51:33] hungweilogaming: it's broken
[3:51:35] officialquail: wow i didnt know that they added them. economy gonna be busted now
[3:51:38] Kingconn223: sadly I do not think the exchange worth it, on whitemane its $20 for 11k. People that buy gold on websites can buy 30k for around that price
[3:51:43] Ryziger: I would uninstall
[3:51:46] Ashmeh: agreed there should be no boosting
[3:51:48] trumptight: id buy a hundred the 1st day
[3:51:57] Hot_Sauce_Ross: wow tokens wreck the economy
[3:51:57] Safty: lol
[3:52:01] Supalis: Arcane Missiles way to go , in one cast you have more potential dmg per mana mana that other spells and also have huge chance for proc CC state.
[3:52:15] Ashmeh: the "buying gold" meta is toxic and part of the reason wow isnt getting new players
[3:52:20] concentratedd: 30k is $31 on faerlina
[3:52:22] trumptight: @arcangelo1556 gold sellers wreck it
[3:52:36] Safty: ***
[3:52:36] land__shark_: 20$ for 11k about rn
[3:52:43] Safty: @switfy aoe barrens lvl 16
[3:52:53] quenzar: It’s around 230k gold on retail atm
[3:53:03] Kingconn223: I'm just saying swifty! I do not buy gold, I am just saying for certain websites gold is dirt cheap
[3:53:09] OverCraftX: bots will sell cheaper always, but is it woth the ban ? probably not
[3:53:10] Kingconn223: not for tokens
[3:53:14] Kingconn223: just gold
[3:53:31] Cowardpatty: My take is that a game company should not sell currency in their game for real life currency for some arbitrary price that they determine.  If people want gold, they should play the game more.   Just my opinion.
[3:53:35] trumptight: wrath is offline ??
[3:53:41] boesb4h035: He’s talking about illegal buying
[3:53:41] concentratedd: that hasnt been the price for 4 months @Swifty
[3:53:46] Korben_dallas5: 30k gold is going for $42 on fearlina atm.
[3:54:35] Creampuff1112: @trumptight server maintinance on EU
[3:54:35] SlowLee_: it was fine deal back then
[3:54:47] Kingconn223: We are not talking about token exchanges swifty, we are talking about just buying straight up gold
[3:55:06] Korben_dallas5: thats whats great about HC is the gold buying plague wont affect it.
[3:55:13] trumptight: @Creampuff1112 ok ty
[3:55:27] tron3kk: farmer crazyjpnHAPPY
[3:55:53] Korben_dallas5: Swifty just grinds his gold 2006 style. OG
[3:55:54] concentratedd: @Korben_dallas5 why wouldnt it
[3:55:57] officialquail: shiiii im bout to be farming game time then
[3:55:58] thornclaw80: The middle farm
[3:56:01] dvmn__: what's up swifty
[3:56:13] TheEndIsNear777: idk wether to roll pvp serv or keep lvling on pve for era pvp reset AngelThump
[3:56:25] Djinx_o: @korben_dallas5 bots will find a way on HC too probably and sadly
[3:56:26] Kingconn223: I do not either, I just know that others do that. My point was that they could have made the token exchange a tad bit better, since other people are going to buy gold the bad way either way. that way they can try to negate that by making the exchange more worth it to buy from them
[3:56:54] catgg12: LOL
[3:56:55] thornclaw80: Go to the middle farm on your map  pull 3 to 4 use Frost nova and stand back a few feet
[3:57:04] hungweilogaming: he's life draining you
[3:57:09] concentratedd: @Djinx_o but u dont even need bots u can just find any normal player w/ a lot of gold who would sell

[3:57:59] Kingconn223: I do love that they brought the token to classic, just wish that it was more worth it. I bought a ton of tokens in legion lol
[3:58:03] portugues01: so once u reach 60, what next?? make a new char???
[3:58:04] OverCraftX: i think middle means left
[3:58:09] Kingconn223: Wrath*
[3:58:12] OverCraftX: jump and arcane

[5:19:23] ragnar2088: what are you talking about
[5:19:28] Pallyofhell: yup ez
[5:19:44] ragnar2088: saying HC is not hard when ppl litearlly die all day everyday...60s die and are heart broken lol
[5:19:45] Pallyofhell: dying to 1 mechanic fights
[5:19:47] ragnar2088: but ye not hard at all
[5:21:14] LAXNESS: @ragnar2088 Classic is super EZ compared to retail mythic content, get Off your high horse
[5:21:21] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:21:34] LAXNESS: HC Classic is Just a massive time sink
[5:21:36] ragnar2088: sounds to me just like how someone says oh 2500 is ez mean while they are 1200 andis
[5:21:50] Pallyofhell: classic andies salty cause their content is a joke LUL
[5:22:07] Drascho27: Swifty you gonna get air hockey for the arcade?
[5:22:09] eggchinX: @ragnar2088 why are you mad though
[5:22:13] ragnar2088: i play litearlly all expansions...but ok
[5:22:32] ragnar2088: not mad i just simply do not agree with you
[5:23:27] eggchinX: k.
[5:24:36] Aldever13: what raid is this?
[5:24:44] LAXNESS: You probably never ran a mythic raid or a mythic+ above 15, saying retail is easy and more easy than Classic is ridic, alot of the stuff in retail has gotten alot easier but Not mythic content my Dude, plus Vanilla raids have Like how many mechanics per Boss? 2,3?
[5:24:48] ragnar2088: You just have lot more at risk in HC..if you make 1 mistake even tho its an ez game...you can lose out on how much time invested?
[5:25:12] ragnar2088: what do you risk in retail? u just res and do it again
[5:25:53] LAXNESS: If you Word it Like that, you could Go Play retail on hc
[5:26:39] ragnar2088: yes you could play retail on HC...but not many ppl prolly do that and dont think its a thing
[5:26:47] ragnar2088: im sure if they did that people would
[5:26:48] LAXNESS: One is a massive time sink the other one is Just massively overtuned for the top 5%
[5:26:52] beedeess: classic raids are easier. but literally the rest of the game is just objectively harder. esp with HC ruleset lol
[5:27:02] ragnar2088: who knows maybe they do after HC release at sme point
[5:27:16] lofi_gaming_: classic is harder just more time consuming lol
[5:27:24] Schledi_TV: gg
[5:27:25] lofi_gaming_: isnt*
[5:27:34] ragnar2088: just think when your death means delete...u litearlly cant make any mistakes...which in my eyes makes it harder than a game where u can make 100000 mistakes and continue
[5:27:53] beedeess: lol so you're telling me if you pull 4 monsters in hardcore classic it isn't objectively harder than killing 4 mobs in retail LUL
[5:27:54] ragnar2088: the game might not be harder but the HC aspect makes it harder
[5:28:00] lofi_gaming_: @ragnar2088  ZzZzZzZzZzZz
[5:28:05] snerkx: thats completely subjective
