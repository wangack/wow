[0:20:18] Samiccus: game is just a bit high
[0:20:39] duffman27350: !drops

[0:20:47] Samiccus: thats great
[0:20:55] Samiccus: perfect
[0:21:54] Luxthos: You got a 2 PC setup?
[0:21:59] Luxthos: Wondering how complicated it would be
[0:22:33] Necrom93: I'm not sure how to word this, but your voice sounds more 'condensed'. Before, it sounded as if it was taking up the entirety of my headphones.
[0:22:42] Luxthos: Yeah I have 2 PC, but with the GoXLR I just one 1 cable
[0:22:52] Luxthos: Wondering how your new setup is doing audio wise for 2 PC
[0:24:49] Luxthos: Yeah, just didn't wanted to swap my mic, been enjoying the Shure
[0:25:16] qualybased: ez
[0:26:35] Necrom93: Nah, it's not a volume issue. I'm trying to say your previous setup sounded more full - in a good way.
[0:27:01] JaeDee: what mixer u have now?
[0:27:06] JaeDee: for the 2 pc

[0:27:41] Luxthos: Wave Mic from Elgato takes care of the Mixer
[0:27:52] JaeDee: i wish i could use bluetooth with goxlr
[0:28:12] Luxthos: it's software based, but there's surely a way to connect a physical mixer to those channel, that would be insane!
[0:28:50] Luxthos: I like physical, especially when I'm playing a game that doesn't let me get my cursor out, I prefer it to having to click the sliders etc...
[0:29:35] JaeDee: with the ways u can do it with goxlr theres lag
