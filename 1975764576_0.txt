[2:08:31] bloodsnaill: You aren‚Äôt playing classic wow 2019 where you want to kill bosses in 13 seconds it‚Äôs hardcore and you won‚Äôt be running 30+ warriors. Not running and extra pally for bops and lay on hands is just stupid unless you are scripting deaths in Mc then fair enough
[2:08:31] Eatingtime: @lupusdeus he doesn't care if someone is a bad spec or a paladin. it is specifically because he wanted esfand to try something different. there are other pallys in the guild who have no punishment for it
[2:08:31] specialkidmiles: would you disenchant gear instead of giving it to someone in negatives? @sodapoppin
[2:08:32] Tetrabud: youre only doing 1 raid at a time anyways
