[3:49:08] Clicklesly: There's issues with not being able to learn talents when you log in...
[3:49:23] Yagr6: hot take give all healers a version of PI and then they can just fight over healing numbers
[3:49:50] LegacyofTork: The nice thing on retail in late expansion is that being a healer in low keys is the same as being DPS. If you’re not pushing, it’s really fun just playing oddball heal specs.

[4:01:51] billybaggens: my dragon riding mount disappeared haha have that happen?
[4:01:51] GingerPurple: @CommanderKrano Yeah but back in those days, i would login and be in raids 5-8 hours a day.
[4:01:58] innuend0o: @CommanderKrano I think it was the opposite actually. People basically raid logged and thats it
[4:02:02] Shrenko: @Holysal yeah thats good
[4:02:02] Funderik: people raid logged on classic, there was nothing to do outside of raiding, i was there.
[4:02:03] Gecko4nine: my first server was low now its full
[4:02:09] bushmaster03: Also, after building pcs for while now, there will always be a new faster gpu.
[4:02:12] Yagr6: i did phase 1 and that was all
[4:02:18] looney199725: wow has big drop offs all the time ppl stick around for like 3-4 months and leave alot the time
[4:02:20] GrimmStalkR: lmao fucking ads
[4:02:27] CommanderKrano: hmmm, alright, true 🤔
[4:02:28] Shrenko: @Holysal playing other games too when I get bored. but I mostly only play gw2 or wow
[4:02:34] bgod2500: closest thing to a real classic experience is grobbulus, rest of the servers are GDKP owned and raid logger central
[4:02:36] doomkry: but the problem with back then and now is that ppl have more games to play online now than in wow old days
[4:02:36] MILESkg21: whats an ad Kappa
[4:02:43] tyler2tall89: PC's have surpassed the requirments for most games these days
[4:02:44] Funderik: wrath will have a faster drop off i feel.
[4:03:00] PidiaP: Classic will always be ResidentSleeper

[4:04:04] SherriJade: don't make alts rep grind to get the upgrades. if I took months to rep grind to exalted on my main.. then my alts should have it too.
[4:04:28] warrenny: Havent they said the rep stuff is account wide?
[4:04:30] doomkry: i think leggo cost/crafting and covenant restrictions is what killed the game for most ppl in shadowlands @Towelliee
[4:04:50] Nice_n_Dicey: if they dont do that, it'll flop
[4:04:54] Funderik: hope they just keep future patches in the dragon isles and stop making throw away new areas, like maw/korthia/zerath/mechagon etc, they need to make the main area feel alive and busy.
[4:05:16] acebrown24: @towelliee so whens the healer coming
[4:05:21] Akoudadis: each season im playing a diff char
[4:05:24] Youredoneson666: If that doesn't happen, it'll be get everything max level, and stop playing AGAIN
[4:05:30] Nice_n_Dicey: agreed
[4:05:34] Aquadriel: m+ score should be account wide
[4:05:47] thiccsushi: I think a good middle ground is letting the valor cap be higher to start with
[4:05:47] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:05:47] looney199725: @Aquadriel it is with raider io u link your account?
[4:06:08] innuend0o: alts literally are the easiest way to make a game "replayable"
[4:06:23] Soulshine81: That was what is was like earlyer. I got "stuck" on a main. Just because I did not want the grind again.
[4:06:36] DaniLaDee: Yeah they need to step it up
[4:06:38] Peqdevil: just want us to pay to play plain and simple,gotta have the sub
[4:06:40] Tomykoks: are world quests avialable? what are the rewards, only gold? @Towelliee
[4:06:48] aLargeBoke: currently uncapped valor makes heroic raids useless
[4:07:01] Admiller0: hard agree
[4:07:02] Nice_n_Dicey: exactly
[4:07:02] CmdKookie: Do you think they will ever make the old reputations account wide?
[4:07:15] Deadelus0: Then remove the gear from that shit?
[4:07:19] thiccsushi: 2 out of 14 slots oh no!
[4:07:31] TheItalianStallion321: god forbid
[4:07:33] tyler2tall89: im not really a fan of the "legendary" story line gear they give us
[4:07:35] rockytcp: then they must replace the gear reward with something else at that renown level
[4:07:36] doomkry: if they made old reputations with the renown system it would be massive
[4:07:40] Alienfromger: just take it out problem solved
[4:07:42] Admiller0: and its shit thatll be replaced by raid i bet
[4:07:44] tyler2tall89: id rather it not be there at all
[4:07:45] looney199725: lmao that noise
[4:07:59] GrimmStalkR: true

[5:31:03] cptsafari: @Artiiz ah good shout
[5:31:36] cptsafari: so dungeons from 60-63, then campaign?
[5:31:57] StuMc: do you need to do story to start end game  like you did in SL ?
[5:32:02] NotReIevant: What tank is looking the best - should I shelv my Veng DH and start up a Blood DK?

[5:32:35] Malvurak9109: @towelliee how is dragonflight looking compared to shadowlands around this time?
[5:32:53] Rakim88: rolling back in dungeons is scary WutFace u could get the negative talent pts bug
[5:33:02] droinux: nice, it was a big nerf losing extended drw
[5:33:11] GamerKillance: Dragonflight is feeling rushed
[5:33:17] bypized: @Towelliee do you feel like is more fun?
[5:33:35] ArcaneMaki: I hated mostly Shadowlands because of the locked convenants system.
[5:33:36] bypized: Shadowlands looks at its final state feels rushed
[5:34:08] ArcaneMaki: Oh and Sylvanas story arc was trash.
[5:34:09] dasdoody: This is the wotlk dungeon reskinned lol
[5:34:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The trees are so much nicer than crafting separate legendaries (and crafting the "wrong" ones, wasting things)
[5:34:26] GamerKillance: Well shadowlands at the beginning def had content and a decent setting. The issue is the Maw was HORRIBLE place and they put so much content in there that people ignored it overall
[5:34:30] dasdoody: The Nexus
[5:34:33] GamerKillance: They put them back by a lot
[5:34:41] GamerKillance: I would say Maw ruined shadowlands
[5:35:02] bypized: The Maw left a bad taste from the begining
[5:35:28] edeasknight: handle it
[5:35:29] bypized: Korthia is ok
[5:35:34] istafel: How are the tacks stacking up? Is Prot War looking like the god it was theory crafted to be?
[5:35:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: The start of Shadowlands fucked me up because the legendary recipe I wanted wasn't even available for weeks
[5:35:38] istafel: *tanks
[5:35:48] GamerKillance: They put so much effort and resources into the Maw only for it to LITERALLY kill the expansion
[5:35:52] GamerKillance: Such a bad bad BAD idea
[5:36:01] Tharia: for me the maw was okay except the stupid rule of no mounting
[5:36:38] itsbananas01: Did the  devs release the second pass on DK talent trees?

[5:38:13] preheats_lawyer: @Towelliee Yo does it seem like the end game content is able to replace the amount of content we got from AP grinds?
[5:38:20] enux337: will do
[5:38:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those grinds were infinite
[5:38:57] Aidler: i have the soul at 285. max I can get.. but it’s ok
[5:38:58] a_confused_cyborg: @preheats_lawyer Dont even want it tbh lol
[5:39:04] Akermay: Not a bad thing though. Time to play more games and shorter patch cycle = win
[5:39:10] Diastemuh: if you were to start off in classic wotlk what would you be your main?

[5:39:19] istafel: How do the tanks feel compared to one another?? Like is there a clear "This tank is going to be top dog" or are they balanced fairly well ?

[5:41:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Without an infinite grind, you run into walls where you are maxed out until the next tier of activities

[5:42:01] thiccsushi: @wEiRdO_dUdE That's where you play alts or do transmog/achievement stuff

[5:42:33] TheCliffyShow: Fun? WoW players are gonna hate that.

[5:42:52] frekiundgeri: one question with version from details you use , my details is alltime not running in beta
[5:43:01] fat_european0: It'll come down to how fun the extra activites are. Would I rather do the zone renown/rep grinds or would I rather play a different game is the question i'll be asking.

[5:44:35] Phil87z: Zerith Mortis was a pretty good litmus test. The people that don’t care about gear will avoid the big three

[5:47:08] Analfabestia: actually yes, for the first time, period. All expansions, even vanilla, profession gear was useless after the first patch. Only tbc and wrath had some nice recipes from SWP, BT and ICC
[5:47:14] TheUnknowing: towNut3 towSweat
[5:47:18] Nebulizer87: crafting overhaul long overdue tho i wish we could get a minigame with each crafting process
[5:47:28] Grey_masterr: It sounds like a huge pay to gear up...you know...
[5:47:28] SilkeySmooth: the whole point of reagents being in raids/m+ is to sell wow tokens
[5:47:38] Mecabeast: bet for most people it will be about a month of grinding per specialization to max out
[5:47:43] Ch3ddar: bring brawlers guild back
[5:47:56] Infinitepeeep: @Towelliee thought on Harry Potter movies?
[5:48:04] FunkyTurtlle: Does the Mythic Reagent only show up in the drops if you are a crafting proffesion? or is there a chance that it drops for anyone and it can be sold on AH? @Towelliee
[5:48:10] Analfabestia: btw do we have an estimate or hunch when pre-patch will pop live?
[5:48:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: If it takes 200 hours of grinding to make a mythic raid level item, I'm cool with that. That sounds fun to me
[5:48:44] FunkyTurtlle: or anyone in chat honestly
[5:48:48] fat_european0: I think professions would be a lot more fun if we could do all of them on a single character

[5:50:54] looney199725: @fat_european0 ofc it will be expensive there the ones who put the time into mythic kills
[5:51:04] nytebayne: yay sockets!

[5:52:09] Tharia: oh that's pretty cool. I like crafting, but I like variety too. so when bored of raiding/m+, I can craft
[5:52:41] fat_european0: i hope they buff secondaries and remove stats DR. Secondaries are so much more fun than main stat

[5:54:32] Akuma_Akatsuki: Nah fuck em i'm going to make that gold off my guild too
[5:54:32] skiller2b_: idk about that @Towelliee , maybe one or two people, sure.. but imagine getting master crafters for each piece of gear of every type
[5:54:40] Bayne77: puts in the tip duckCreep

[5:56:01] Lostdogal: shit, outside of guild better stock up on wow tokens then or start leveling crafters on alts
[5:56:01] cabalish: this is classic 2.0
[5:56:25] Ch3ddar: that's good
[5:56:30] SilkeySmooth: what???
[5:56:34] skiller2b_: so thats my point, a mythic guild wouldnt waste time getting master crafters, which values crafting in general
