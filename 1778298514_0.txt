[2:09:45] ashleybanks: Swifty, can you do the missing finger in the ear trick for me?
[2:09:46] Pallyofhell: they already said it will be there
[2:09:47] SoulCoinz: swifty do u run m+ ?
[2:09:52] stormwindchill: @Pallyofhell all aspects of a game need to be tested.  think of how many bugs games have
[2:09:55] Arkitek: so probably not at release heh
[2:09:59] OGSceneBoy: Yeah the PvP tab was in the beta, just not active
[2:10:01] pickwick85: I remember playing tbc wow back in the day, and watching swifty's warrioe tricks on yt <3
[2:10:13] Pallyofhell: you can literally test the aspect of pvp just doing the base game LUL

[2:12:21] xxshaze: @Fowlen_ same for me
[2:12:32] Pallyofhell: the click to move has been a thing since the beginning
[2:12:41] xxshaze: @Fowlen_ you can kite much better
[2:12:43] Pallyofhell: i doubt they will change it
[2:13:06] Arkitek: i rebound my keys to d3 when i started so qwer and tab as my potion with m for map and 1-2 for area and.. well forget the last lol
[2:13:08] pickwick85: You hold mouse to move, nobody clicks..
[2:13:12] fowlentv: @Pallyofhell they had it for immortal and can always just make it an option
[2:13:38] Pallyofhell: yea no rather not take things from immortal. the stuff they already took from it is enough
[2:14:11] Pallyofhell: you shouldnt be clicking all that much to begin with
[2:14:14] Arkitek: if u didnt buy into immortal the game itself was actually great
[2:14:25] Arkitek: i played, hit max, had fun, and left lol
[2:14:50] fowlentv: @Pallyofhell during combat wasd just feels better imo
[2:15:13] Pallyofhell: it feels better because its what you're use to with mmos
[2:15:18] Pallyofhell: this is an arrpg
[2:15:37] Pallyofhell: its not suspose to play like wow
[2:16:04] fowlentv: @Pallyofhell thats fair but to have an option for it wouldnt be bad imo
[2:16:04] Kriptz01: They made D4 for consoles mainly. PC is optional to them.
[2:16:09] LX2_EXE: We need to build a wall on that border and make the dragons pay for it
[2:16:13] Kriptz01: The game will be bored 6 months in.
[2:16:22] Pallyofhell: what LUL
[2:16:45] Arkitek: yea embrace the wasd pally :p
[2:16:46] Pallyofhell: D4 wasnt made for consoles mainly LUL

[2:17:36] fowlentv: thyere fine
[2:17:42] woognostic: what up swifgty
[2:17:46] Humicrobe: killing loot goblins in wows new zone is fun lol
[2:17:56] Pallyofhell: D4 will never go on phones when immortals exist
[2:18:03] Pallyofhell: like what
[2:18:30] LX2_EXE: you zoned out
[2:18:31] Johnny1upz: KPOPheart
[2:18:35] Kriptz01: It will. Blizzard knows that there is too much money to be made. D4 will be pay to win. That's for sure.
[2:18:44] Pallyofhell: LUL
[2:18:59] Arkitek: @Pallyofhell Not to play devils advocate, but i am. Since microsoft is buying blizz i feel like they are purposely heading that way, even d3 was avalable on ps and a lot did play it there.
[2:19:06] Humicrobe: yeah its like hunter fist of fury lol
[2:19:06] fowlentv: d4 will not be on tablets and phones
[2:19:10] Kriptz01: It's sad because the gaming is not about skills anymore. It's how popular you are or how big your wallet is.
[2:19:10] LX2_EXE: omg the mammoth is angry
[2:19:26] Humicrobe: also lowers bomb cd
[2:19:28] Pallyofhell: thats cause D3 was asked to be put on console by a lot of the community
[2:19:58] canndy: @Swifty do you still use the Razer Orbweaver? FeelsOkayMan

[2:20:42] Kriptz01: Lol not everyone who kill Swifty is sniping.. Chill guys hahaha
[2:21:01] Humicrobe: gotta show your place in the pecking order
[2:21:18] Pallyofhell: diablos main playstyle hasnt changed since day 1. long before the idea of making it cross platform
[2:21:25] stormwindchill: my calculations tell me only 13% of them are actually stream snipers
[2:21:26] hugelamp: I think the hunter is just in group with people youre attacking
[2:21:27] Kriptz01: I mean if he's always on you sure lol

[2:25:57] Kriptz01: DF at this point is like a giant beta testing. The amount of tuning going on in this xpac is insane
[2:26:08] TheEndIsNear777: if you're not 2h obliterate with cooldowns
[2:26:15] jayelayy: Pally is fine people need to stop hating they’ve been bad in so many xpacs let them get their moment
[2:26:33] Pallyofhell: ppl just dont like rets

[2:27:54] Pallyofhell: highest death count spec as well
[2:28:02] johncriton: joined a bg earlier nothing but pallys
[2:28:05] johncriton: lol
[2:29:14] Pallyofhell: no
[2:29:27] Pallyofhell: it gives them time to tune it before next season
[2:29:30] fowlentv: it gives em time to fix em though
[2:30:01] fowlentv: what pally said

[2:30:58] Pallyofhell: why did it take you so long to die with so many rets then
[2:31:02] fowlentv: Let ret have their time rogues stay op for months lol

[7:11:21] rasputin_fusher: Is there any macro how to target a player with lowest HP?
[7:11:21] Ruvon_XL: Hey Swifty, as an old WoW veteran from Classic times, what do you think of the more or less merging of the Horde and Alliance. For me as an old orc it doesn't sound good to be in a guild with elves and gnomes :) @Swifty

[7:13:26] SCHLEMM: good, yourself?
[7:13:32] frosty78: keybind your tab target to nearest enemy player, youl ignore pets
[7:13:32] Chimmy81: didn't glaives get nerfed?
[7:14:19] Xaviwan078: swifty im in love with the ret paladin im playing right now thanks blizz for the new talent
[7:14:50] Siccarius101: yo gg on silvershard bro I got lucky with that top cart, jumped behind the cap and shadowmelded after we started wiping up there the cart before was a fun game
[7:15:05] Chimmy81: the game is dying man
[7:15:20] Chimmy81: for real this time
[7:15:46] deadnsyde1: love you swifty
[7:16:28] Chimmy81: it went downhill when they introduced crz, killed the communities
[7:16:49] Shalyon: blizz should just give free access to classic tbh
[7:17:01] Shalyon: more ppl will get engaged in wow if they do that

[7:17:22] Chimmy81: i started playing because of you back in the day, you and dremlock, remember his shaman videos?
[7:17:24] Teagens: My issue with Classic is that I already DID all the original Vanilla stuff up to current and I have no desire to go backwards, I want the current game to continue to improve and get better because that is what every WoW expansion has been about, making improvements to bring more enrichments to the community
[7:17:37] drako_pt: jesus , amazing !! wp man
[7:18:15] Sunglassestony: @Teagens Good pov
[7:18:33] Chimmy81: @Teagens this is the problem, you can't pile content on top of content and don't expect it to dilute the expierience at some point. they need a fresh start.
[7:18:59] Pallyofhell: did he just say that
[7:19:03] Pallyofhell: LUL
[7:19:03] mustiparta: 1s

[7:20:48] Pallyofhell: some of them dont work
[7:20:48] Teagens: @Chimmy81 True and the reason people are going BACK to Classic is because current content is not offering that enrichment and new experience. But instead of throwing back to old days that do nothing to improve the game, the community should rally together and encourage the developers TO continue to fix and improve the ACTUAL current game, not past iterations that do nothing to help it in it's current state
[7:20:52] Sunglassestony: They never work for me LUL

[7:22:00] GalachadQT: how does it make sense to say people want new content and that's why they're playing classic?

[7:22:30] DreckenTV: classic is a totally different community than retail
[7:23:14] Chimmy81: how can you expect to lose all key devs and remain the soul. ship of theseus
[7:23:17] Xaviwan078: i prefer retail but like classic for nostalgia

[7:25:10] Teagens: @pepeesquire I'm not saying they are playing Classic becausse they want new content, because Classic IS NOT NEW. I'm saying that people WANT NEW content but rather than continuing to encourage and work with the Developers to improve CURRENT Retail WoW, they are flocking back to Classic which does nothing to help Retail WoW improve
