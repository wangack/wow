[3:29:32] CrusaderNero: @TheEndIsNear777 not really. retail & classic is same sub
[3:29:38] brodycanuck: @FlameStryke No chance everyone would want classic, but it would get more popular for sure

[3:44:39] Beastafied: all you need is Peanut to read the quests.
[3:44:41] Wingardpvp: @Swifty The crazy thing about this voiceover addon is that it actually mimics the races... Like it sounds like an orc if you get a quest from an orc, it sounds like a tauren if you geta  quest from a tauren etc... :D

[3:45:20] frosty78: the AI is using the game voice files, its not making it own stuff up...cmon ppl
[3:45:25] lunatik710: they dont have voices for some races and some models of people yet like pirates and others
[3:45:29] bitlexx: @Sybot more rules
[3:45:34] khaobz: what is the voice over addon
[3:45:34] iberucks: !gamble 10%
[3:45:34] FlameStryke: the only glitch is the voices change for each part so if the quest has 2 parts each one will sound different
[3:45:34] StreamElements: iberucks lost 6286 points in roulette and now has 56574 points! FeelsBadMan
[3:45:35] frosty78: so you would still need an actor to make the voice\

[4:09:02] lain_jpeg: yo swifty are you excited for d4? looks like what d3 should have been with alot of d2 inspiration
[4:09:37] Blaster: the music man
[4:09:48] lain_jpeg: havent seen it
[4:10:31] lain_jpeg: wish they would just copy poe
[4:10:40] CabraBOOM: a way better D3
[4:10:40] Smidz_: @mattheafy_mods_triggered You say that like D3 was bad, when it absolutely wasn't.
[4:10:43] OGSceneBoy: I was hoping alot for D4 PvP, but it appears its just a small zone with not a big majority of the playerbase participating
[4:10:50] PandaSmuggl3r: I don't think Diablo has ever been a pvp thing. People play it for pve
[4:11:08] lain_jpeg: im going to grind pvp alot, but you can also pvp anyone walking through a zone whenever both people have completed a zone and are going through it again, something no one is really talking about
[4:11:37] ItsJontyTV: last time i was in your stream you were against hardcore, what made you change your mind

[4:11:50] OGSceneBoy: I feel like you will just be chasing like cat and mouse, not really big 1v1 matches
[4:11:51] fizrukh: bro its d2 was the same
[4:11:55] JumboShrayump: There should be at least a time period before the flag wears off like gurubashi
[4:12:00] JumboShrayump: instead of being instant
[4:12:04] Plioscu: swifty in classic is big POG
[4:12:40] lain_jpeg: you can also pvp anyone in zones that have been completed
[4:12:43] OGSceneBoy: D4 battlegrounds would be amazing imo
[4:12:48] DrizzTV: Good voice
[4:12:48] OGSceneBoy: The mechanics would work with it
[4:12:56] VanishmentThisWorld: i saw a vid of a sorc running super widescreen and casting way super far away that you cant do normally
[4:13:02] lain_jpeg: @GothStarz that would be sick

[4:13:33] OGSceneBoy: What a cool addon
[4:13:34] AnUntakenUsername: voice over is really good combined with the storyline addon
[4:13:35] brodycanuck: They must know about it
[4:13:40] nahhdruid: Why pay for dev when you can have someone make an addon for free
[4:13:53] Caveman_3: damn that was good
[4:13:54] Envoy04: what is the voice addon

[4:14:42] Shiftea24: whats this addon
[4:14:44] lain_jpeg: @DrizzTV they want classic to die, they wanna work on retail and new games thats why
[4:14:46] Caveman_3: that is great
[4:14:53] Cowardpatty: Addon is called "VoiceOver"
[4:14:59] lain_jpeg: it sounds so good
[4:15:08] Shiftea24: @Cowardpatty ty
[4:15:10] Jivansito: thank you

[4:15:38] lain_jpeg: swifty are you going to play cataclysm?
[4:15:45] Ezcotli: NotLikeThis
[4:15:51] Caveman_3: what addon is it?
[4:15:53] Cowardpatty: The problem with AI voice over is lack of QC
[4:16:00] OGSceneBoy: The small individual devs always go unnoticed ;(
[4:16:03] usefulidiotgg: 2 weeks
[4:16:08] usefulidiotgg: maybe
[4:16:18] Ezcotli: only a month or so
[4:16:23] VanishmentThisWorld: what do the nightelf girls sound like?

[4:17:24] Cowardpatty: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/voiceover
[4:17:36] DrizzTV: There is gnome and dwarf in Auberdine. Talk to them!
[4:17:39] xxf3v3rxx: is it just for classic?
[4:17:41] lain_jpeg: thats really good, i wanna know what rexxar sounds like
[4:17:56] DrizzTV: Gnomes must be funny
[4:18:02] OGSceneBoy: Lol
[4:18:03] Voodoodippin: I remember back in the day i played a Dungeons & Dragons MMO and it had narrated quests. it was amazing
[4:18:10] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[4:18:13] OGSceneBoy: Little squeky gnome girl voice
[4:18:27] AnUntakenUsername: the addon itself doesn't have an AI, it's just a bunch of prerecorded lines made by AI packaged into the addon.
[4:19:19] brodycanuck: the AI reads it
[4:19:24] nallenferal: Well, now that there is AI to do the voice, these are probably able to have quests voiced over. Seeing as how the voice actor cost probably won't be a factor anymore :)
[4:19:46] wheatthin1: hi :)
[4:19:57] AnUntakenUsername: they fed lines into an AI, recorded the result, and then put all of it into an addon. it doesn't read quest text on the fly.
[4:20:14] charlieftw2022: voiceover addon should be impletemented with that storyline addon, that would be awesome
[4:20:21] AnUntakenUsername: i dug into the addon just to look at it and that's why the download is so big
[4:20:24] charlieftw2022: implemented*
[4:20:28] lain_jpeg: @AnUntakenUsername there is no way they did that for every voicelines
[4:20:41] Decoilingg: Got killed allot by the alliance patrol in the barrends LUL
[4:20:47] CabraBOOM: 1gb
[4:20:53] VanishmentThisWorld: on turtle wow alliance always got killed by defias dockmaster, murlocs, and stitches
[4:21:04] lain_jpeg: theres 1000 quests lol
[4:21:28] lain_jpeg: it listens to a voice thats already been made and then it copies its inflections then it reads the text in the games code
[4:21:40] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:21:42] nallenferal: Well imagine how much voice AI has been trained these last couple of years
[4:21:43] AnUntakenUsername: look in the addon's files, there's a folder with 6,558 mp3s
[4:21:44] lain_jpeg: it only needs a couple words to hear and it can copy the voice
[4:21:53] Wingardpvp: @Swifty the reason why the addon is so big in size bc. the makers of the addon put the ai generated sound files into this addons folder, so basically the addon just plays a sound file
[4:22:19] lain_jpeg: @AnUntakenUsername well if they did that they are tweakers lololol
[4:22:38] AnUntakenUsername: if you want to see all the voice files go to this
[4:22:40] proxyhella: hugs from Brazil !
[4:22:40] AnUntakenUsername: _classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\AI_VoiceOver\VoiceOverData_Vanilla\generated\sounds\quests
[4:22:48] usefulidiotgg: they need to make an ai addon too read /s and /p in those racial voices
[4:22:48] Ezionn: @swifty No joke. You should do voice lines for video game.
[4:22:57] AnUntakenUsername: that's the file destination
[4:23:02] lain_jpeg: @AnUntakenUsername crazie
[4:23:24] Farmerjag: do you like having so many variations of warcraft right now? wotlk, HC, retail, Classic....
[4:23:50] nomanual: revenge in wrath is busted
[4:23:56] VanishmentThisWorld: heck yea its like more flavors of icecream
[4:24:05] AnUntakenUsername: there's like 6,700 quest mp3 recordings, and like 3,000 npc gossip recordings
[4:24:19] Maxamillium: nah
[4:24:20] lain_jpeg: im just waiting on the offical hardcore servers

[4:24:27] nightwhisperer: nope
[4:24:32] SilkeySmooth: what about another classic wow launch but with tbc talents?
[4:24:37] mccreads: When I did it the first time I did the iron man challenge thing to 60 - made it there and died within an hour in epl
[4:24:50] lain_jpeg: they datamined hc servers, its on wowhead classic
[4:24:53] OGSceneBoy: @AnUntakenUsername If thats the case, the retail version is probably HUGEEE
[4:24:53] Scarmarkz: With so many different games out how do you manage to just stick with blizzard games for so long?
[4:24:57] Farmerjag: when you play hardcore, does it stop after rag or continue onto other raids after?
[4:25:13] lain_jpeg: yeeeee
[4:25:16] lain_jpeg: hopefully we get it
[4:25:20] ryanblue98: imagine hardcore bg
[4:25:44] lain_jpeg: @ryanblue98 would be awful lololol
[4:25:59] lain_jpeg: getting hit by a random chain lighting for 5k
[4:26:07] BunnyBunBunGoodness: It would be either a 1v1, or a 1v0
[4:26:19] BunnyBunBunGoodness: Or no one wins lol

[8:58:09] Pragma8123: I'm really regretting transferring from SoM to wrath. Didn't think Classic would blow up like this!
[8:58:12] Xaviwan078: imagine get 60 in hardcore server full raid stuff every thing and you die
[8:58:31] erousagi: They know how HC works, I mean the whole hardcore thing is from Diablo and it's a strict death in both D2R and D3. The issue is if they do an offical HC server, they need to code all the rules and  prevent any exploit, which are a lot in Classic
[8:58:43] P4pirate: classic to tbc,
[8:58:49] P4pirate: you had that issue
[8:58:51] Galdrena: no he doesn't @KodiakJedi but if anyone ever clips his addons and sends it to me I would be more than happy to make a command :)

[9:22:14] hydraponix: i could be mistaken then, one of those quests is a fishing one
[9:22:25] danieltzf: Do you think Dragonflight is one of the top 3 expansions of wow ?

[9:22:50] TravisThee: the problem with retail imho is it doesn't feel like a community
[9:22:57] TravisThee: it feels like a solo game where you play with randos
[9:23:20] liljon0123: i agree travis
[9:23:21] karma_chemeleon_0_0: 10min spawn for that boss
[9:23:34] TravisThee: i'm talking about retail not HC
[9:23:59] Mincest_7: there is a lot of cool people playing retail tho
[9:24:03] Maverick_TV: @Sheepeiy kinda... you have to list yourself and what dungeon and you can see all the other characters for that instance
[9:24:04] shamscam: I agree with travis its extremally hard to find a good group of friends in WoW anymore
[9:24:05] Mincest_7: I make some new friends this expa
[9:24:10] TravisThee: in HC i've made so many friends. I actually care what they're doing and what's going on
[9:24:28] greasyg0blin: which book is that?

[9:24:59] dmv_luke: dragonflight is so much better than past expansions tho its  been really fun
[9:25:33] danieltzf: What are the top 3 expansions in your opinion ?
[9:25:51] liljon0123: i think u would enjoy retail more if i didnt play pvp only retail
[9:25:54] liljon0123: I*
[9:25:56] dmv_luke: cross factions guild should help that tho in the next patch
[9:26:02] Calmindz: Its hard for them to remake the experience because we are jot the same age and we get bored a lot faster now that we played it already
