[2:25:42] SonofHorus82: @Molvonos same here. I remember being at the bowling alley when they first got TMNT. It was an insane time. I was also there for the debut of Mortal Kombat. What a great time that was.
[2:25:53] xendros78: champion, we need to get the boons

[2:26:09] Sheckly84: oh okay, I was wondering why I got modded. Anyway, which mentioning THAT aspect of things, I just think they while you may have an argument of companies being greedy, you also don't have the right to shame other in how they spend their money.
[2:26:15] cyrex172: its fuckn cold jn cali r now
[2:26:17] Sollice: I played a lot of the Aliens arcade game bacl om tje dau

[2:27:44] SamuraiWillZ916: if bg3 came out with dlc I’d buy I’d buy it in a heartbeat
[2:27:49] Kratosjr1: and thats why i wat ch Towelliee
[2:27:57] Sheckly84: TRUE! There's a popular Youtube creator that is correct about A LOT of things in the politics sphere, who also says boycots don't do jack shit. And I agree with him.
[2:28:15] cyrex172: molv i remember destroying ppl with m bison for free quarters
[2:28:23] Molvonos: We're just gone full circle.  Arcades were 'Microtransaction', then consoles/PC, and now we're back at microtransactions
[2:28:23] cyrex172: shot was so fun
[2:28:23] KroniclyLazy: fortnite makes the money BG3 makes in a few months lol
[2:28:24] warrenny: @ambiotic literally
[2:28:31] Avinar: They will see "Dang, that game looks 20x harder to make for only 1/3rd of our profit"
[2:28:31] RaidbossTV: I'm curious if the Once Human devs stand on their mountain against MTX on release
[2:28:38] metavahn231: bg3 just proved good devs can make good games LUL
[2:28:38] Molvonos: Most of the whiners live in that blissfully stupid period of time when their parents bought them games.

[2:29:02] Molvonos: lol
[2:29:07] Sheckly84: Also true
[2:29:17] TheGamingDead: Wouldn’t expansions technically be DLC?
[2:29:18] cyrex172: time on game= quality game. what a concept
[2:29:24] ambiotic: Baulders gate 3 was also in prerelease for 3 years, so they got money in presales for 3 years. so i guess that is the lesson
[2:29:30] instructOS: my god son is addicted to buying stuff on fortnite

[2:37:33] Armdel: isn't a closed beta though, meaning limited invites
[2:38:05] zodd_amhai: yeah same i cant get it
[2:38:10] Avinar: I was always intimidated by PoE and I felt like I needed to research a lot
[2:38:12] TheGiant99: The POE campaign over and over is real bad
[2:38:17] belaham: you have to speed run the acts at the start of each season
[2:38:22] ambiotic: And blizzard, if you are watching, you need a in depth crafting system in ARPGS. POE seasons are lame right now cause they are not doing a big balance pass so the builds are the same so releveling feels like a big chore.

[2:39:15] Alaquane: I burn out on the campaign before reaching maps every time
[2:39:20] Sheckly84: Yeah I'm not a big fan of going over the POE campaign over and over, plus I don't know, some of the system's in POE I still don't like. But that stuff seems to be changing in POE II
[2:39:42] Brodih_: D4 is great, it just needs content and gear stat overhaul
[2:39:43] ambiotic: Last Epoch you can level thru the campaign in like 5 hours, its not bad at all
[2:39:56] PotbellyGoat: towKek
[2:39:59] dream_boxing: morning Towelliee and chat!!
[2:40:08] ambiotic: Donruss you can at least get downtowns
[2:40:17] Dred_Scythe: LE is somewhere between D4 and PoE. It's for sure has more than D4, but it's not a complete rat's nest like PoE, so easier to ease into.
[2:40:18] DeckantTV: donruss mega boxes rn are scalped like crazy
[2:40:20] grimmlols: yes lol

[2:42:41] Brodih_: and no question asked
[2:42:43] Sheckly84: I think they should have inverted the legendaries and Uniques in D4. Bring back more fan-favorite Uniques from like DII and shit, and make the legendaries more scarce and have some 'super' legendaries.
[2:42:46] xHukk: my brother is a truck driver.  I know what you mean @Towelliee .

[3:01:25] NicStone8: he walks clockwise around the main pool, spawns infront of the WC entrance
[3:01:33] CrewcutChuck: @brewgamingtv I was, enjoying it, but holding aggro now that warriors are BiS can be a nightmare
[3:01:40] NicStone8: yewa someone got him, he walks  with that duo
[3:01:59] CrewcutChuck: The shaman dps is quite a bit lackluster in comparison to the other melee tanks
[3:02:01] spankymcpie: think it would be funny if they trolled with lower level plate items and if you try equipping it before level 40 your character cant move because of the weight
[3:02:34] CrewcutChuck: 100% have to go duel wield and rockbiter on each weapon to hold aggro to warriors now

[3:38:40] NicStone8: its good for those that use character lvl boost and have no idea how to play that character
[3:38:43] TheGiant99: Yea it's normal only
[3:38:44] sircheex: it for people like me who are too afraid to ruin others experience to try dungeons lol
[3:38:46] cautionreptiles: could be a for traing on how to play
[3:38:48] pigzip: It could be content if you wanted to learn how to heal
[3:38:56] CrunkyBrewster: yeah you dont get a good amount of XP so you wont be able to power level solo through it
[3:39:20] CrunkyBrewster: learning how to heal with emulated bad players
[3:39:22] Alaquane: it's for people who don't want to play with other people
[3:39:32] Rudric_Ice: make follower dungeons upto m+15
[3:39:49] valianya: What if follower dungeon has better exp than being carried by gold payment to sit at door for 20 minutes?
[3:39:49] Gibsonex937: @alaquane exactly
[3:39:50] CrunkyBrewster: my experience healing in FDungeons has been they all are stupid AI who stand in fire and bad mechanics LUL
[3:40:02] Nerendis: @Rudric_Ice This or otherwise it's pointless
[3:40:13] Gibsonex937: mythic pugging scene isn’t as toxic as people think I have 1 bad group out of 20
[3:40:14] avarose8910: what are the drops this time? i assume it’ll start at 10?
[3:40:21] SonofHorus82: @CrunkyBrewster so just normal DPS then

[3:40:56] Verdell263: Yes we do
[3:40:59] AzedaNA: Towellie going to start hand delivering shit and he's not leaving til the door is answered
[3:41:02] CrunkyBrewster: No
[3:41:07] CrunkyBrewster: no one talks in GFinder
[3:41:08] Gibsonex937: nope
[3:41:10] Verdell263: TCG toy  Grim Campfire being offered as a Twitch Drop on the release of Patch 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal on January 16!
[3:41:14] CrunkyBrewster: very rarily do we talk
[3:41:16] Orczeus: it can be if people pull thats not the tank
[3:41:17] dguap: dude does anyone even talk to each other at the level of dungeon crawling? lol it's auto pilot
[3:41:23] AquaJamz: you spend like 5 minutes in a heroic lol
[3:41:23] CrunkyBrewster: yeah exactly
[3:41:27] Nerendis: People don't even talk in heroic dungeons wtf? Y'all should try out League or CSGO before you say WoW is toxic omegalul
[3:41:29] Gibsonex937: no one really talks in M+ either
[3:41:33] Drace76: Drace76 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:41:38] theszoti: i think it's for when dungeons eventually become old content, they can still be done by people who are leveling through df for the first time
[3:41:41] Alaquane: haven't played since shadowlands. heroic people were toxic over covenant drops
[3:41:44] Draz3nx: its not that toxic  in m+
[3:41:47] CrunkyBrewster: very very rarily you'll be talking unless you run into a chatty persons. sometimes you do
[3:41:52] Orczeus: follower dungeon is a good add to the game
[3:42:00] Masqerader: so it's basically proving grounds but with ai
[3:42:04] gajitron: followers for noobs
[3:42:07] gooni_coyg: they should just play SOD and chill :D
[3:42:19] gajitron: true @Towelliee
[3:42:20] thebakeriscomingforu: follower dungeons will be for "training" different roles and doing dungeon quests on normal.
[3:42:31] Treevinal: Treevinal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[3:42:33] valianya: I think it's a good replacement for waiting a half hour in a queue for a heroic dungeon just to see the story or quest.  It's a solo story mode.
[3:42:35] Gibsonex937: well Dragonflight is the new starter so it helps with new players I suppose
[3:42:36] jkitchin75: thay should have it for mythic0
[3:42:38] liesinwaiting: What's funny is that most of the toxic people in League or on other games, are the same toxic individuals on WoW
[3:42:44] Nerendis: I'm happy to test it. But it's just never going to become a content form for me.
[3:42:46] TacoTime_Gaming: ill be trying builds in follower dungeons
[3:42:49] hairydabstv: this is testing for mobile
[3:42:54] shellfishguy: It's great for me, I levelled a prot pally but my anxiety keeps me from tanking for people
[3:42:56] gajitron: So excited for SOD Phase 2 tho, everything will change and meta @Towelliee
[3:42:58] biirrd: and i guess ther more we play it, the better the AI gets and learn for future patchs
[3:43:00] CrunkyBrewster: either way its not mandatory. it'll be nice for gearing alts early on pre-mythic gear
[3:43:09] m4x1gh: I need training for retail on any character hahaha
[3:43:22] Gibsonex937: follower dungeons will be good for instant dungeons next expansion
[3:43:26] magioval: Does it take long to get to level 25 in SOD?
[3:43:27] CrunkyBrewster: I could see it becoming a Speedrunner thing too

[3:44:11] TheGiant99: @gajitron but the content isn't new. Just what skills you use
[3:44:36] Alaquane: Some people have crippling anxiety playing with other people, but they still want to talk to their friends about the game
[3:44:59] CrunkyBrewster: I dont have friends who play this game Aware
[3:45:11] CrunkyBrewster: my friends only play COD or Madden
[3:45:17] gajitron: @TheGiant99 but i love it
[3:45:17] m4x1gh: hahah you both have friends...

[3:49:53] aspiration89: @Calibur84 KEKW yep

[3:53:46] TsunoD: Valverde is one of the best cards in FC24 atm so he might sell for a decent amount.
[3:53:49] valianya: If follower dungeons work, do you think they might expand the free trial?  Older expansion dungeon queues are dead and wouldn't be fun in current state for a free trial more like FF14's to cover an expansion instead of just to lvl 20.  Plus it'll make dungeons in Chromie time better too.

[5:42:44] PadidinJones: @Towelliee finally a good group for your rogue!
[5:42:45] ProtonSter: The market will equalize it, if they don’t pay out, then streamers won’t accept the deals, which means less revenue
[5:42:48] Sollice: Why would I want to unionize on a non standard job and reduce my rates or have someone else get paid more for being less talented?
[5:42:58] AcidAbyss: individual deals make more sense with streamers

[5:43:05] Galadeon: Works for radio personalities.  Basically the same as streamers.
[5:43:09] NicStone8: yea a streamer union would not work, would have to dictate times for upstreams, total hours per week (good bye streamathon)
