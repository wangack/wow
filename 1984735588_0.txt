[2:40:35] seven__h: you can multibox without extra software, just two monitors
[2:40:46] NeonFlux: They were pain in butt in bgs
[2:40:54] SimUser: I remember when multibox was literally 2 computers with a keyboard/mouse switch
[2:41:06] FlyguyJP: Oh so you would need to pay for 2 subscriptions regardless
[2:41:12] Afterlithe: i used to level my wifes toon while she had class, set up her laptop next to my pc

[2:41:56] beNamunous: with multiboxing there is this weird loophole, cause multiboxing is legal as long as you dont use a software to automatize actions
[2:42:04] Zunahme: @jackal_34 seqWoo
[2:42:04] BlooBender: retail up to shadowlands ye
