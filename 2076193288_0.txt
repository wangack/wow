[0:35:22] Nightbot: Wep skill above 305 is good, the theory that you get little benefit beyond 305 was created by the guild APES, under aliases, before classic was released in a warrior discord known as Fight Club. APES chose pvp races that don't get the extra weapon skill bonus but wanted to keep the competition within reach. They have succeeded, until now. One man was brave enough to buy edgemaster on his orc warrior and test out the damage on lvl 63 or “boss” mobs, and the data is astonishing.

[1:40:38] Midiosa: that was what I hated about dad guilds.  They always made us wait until after specific bosses to unboon
[1:40:41] HumungaaDungaa: boon should pop the moment you enter a raid, not even combat
[1:40:57] Fireclipz: spending half the raid booned ruins the whole point of world buffs
[1:41:01] gryescreengaming: you should lose buffs in boon if you die in pvp
[1:41:06] MahliZ: But that is more to drawing it back towards classic, in era
[1:41:17] updobe: that would kill a lot of like mc/bwl pugs tho

[1:41:38] Fireclipz: @updobe you can do mc with lvl 53s in greens lol

[1:42:37] Plusem: WBs should just be perma :D
[1:42:39] Fireclipz: @updobe ah good point actually
[1:42:58] ragesoulppc: and then you kinda need worldbuffs for 4hm saph and kt in mostly every pug
[1:43:08] Plusem: Let's just give everyone a one click to kill something
[1:43:38] ragesoulppc: i know i dont need buffs with certain gamers, but if they dont know what to do
[1:44:00] ragesoulppc: it sucks to not have the buffs for those bosses
[1:44:12] MahliZ: So what if. You can choose what raids your boon will pop in, and as soon as you get in combat in those combat the boons goes online. And if you havn't selected a raid for boons then you can't activate it in that raid at all
[1:44:35] sweaty_irl: what is the lowest number of players that could clear MC? would 10 NaxxBiS warriors 1phase Rag?
[1:44:41] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[1:44:45] MahliZ: That way you can do BWL and it doesn't pop the boon

[1:45:07] ragesoulppc: done ez :D

[1:46:02] Fireclipz: i agree with you but most of the player base would hate that
[1:46:16] 3bonecapone: what if you have naxx later and want to save your buffs for that?
[1:46:21] EsportsBetsGG: Couldnt you just remove the time/effort to get the buffs?
[1:46:33] EsportsBetsGG: Like you just talk to a NPC and get the buffs.
[1:46:33] Fireclipz: the best solution would to only make it in naxx the buffs would pop
[1:46:44] ragesoulppc: cos your not going to gdkps yet for naxx right :D
[1:46:45] Fireclipz: because thats the most annoying salvdaGz
[1:46:50] RossTheBoss__: Just place a NPC at the entrance to every raid that gives u FULL wbs hello dinkDonk
[1:46:57] Niksen_99: Have a NPC in each raid that just makes you fully buffed for free Kappa
[1:46:59] updobe: like that would make it so every naxx has to happen at the beginning of the week after dmf week
[1:47:04] Firebloom: Would you change it in that way if you knew it would diminsh the playerbase?

[1:47:43] MahliZ: I think what someone said was a great solution, you can't boon to save your buffs when you are in a raid.
[1:47:46] Fireclipz: ok guys half of this naxx we arent booning
[1:47:48] peonprime: only buff change that would be acceptable is letting you pick up another rend or dragon head to turn in after already handing in the quest.
