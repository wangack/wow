[0:53:48] haybale20: L take
[0:53:49] ExtantGN: bans are good because it helps you do certain pushes, just to prevent certain counters
[0:53:50] mEczem: sapecialy in LOL 150 legends
[0:53:50] kabramine_: you can ban depending on your strategy on what map...
[0:53:51] ItsBPotato: you ban what you hate tho
[0:53:53] Hungry_Panda91: i never understood why map bans are in ranked.
[0:53:55] klnetics: @easilyvv it works in PL :)
[0:53:55] Chronosrebel: because there‚Äôs meta
[0:53:57] Carn_fu: u know what ur not good against tho
[0:53:59] bedardskii: wym each character plays better on certain maps
[0:54:00] BagelsDE: you ban the hardest to deal with
[0:54:00] Kenny_1291: true
[0:54:00] Seymour9: Its also about the map too
[0:54:01] VoukChaos: some operators are must on some maps
[0:54:02] BagelsDE: yeah thats true
[0:54:02] geartgashi: me and my friends always ban ash and jeagger and people are so mad at it
[0:54:03] lemonpeppastepa: you ban what you are bad at
[0:54:03] DrRaccoon: certain maps have better operators no?
[0:54:03] M1NAkat: but you know what you're good at and each op has a perfect counter
[0:54:04] Chronosrebel: once you really get into siege there‚Äôs meta
[0:54:05] sharp_cheddr: Meta
[0:54:07] Conorwayne: fenrir‚Äôs easily countered by brave or twitch though
[0:54:08] ventiumtwitch: guys, i just want to be sure, I can still have his charm if I sub right?
[0:54:08] sapimpson: do they have champ counters like league?
[0:54:09] ySwxft: depending on the map
[0:54:09] dazai_dazzle: and if the same character is always banned they‚Äôre broken or cheesy
[0:54:10] Yakumo2k: Heyyy
[0:54:10] phniix_: But u ban Ops in Ranked from Op Ops like Fenrir or Solis or whatever
[0:54:11] corvus_55: sometimes some ops are really good on certain maps
[0:54:14] RockinaTurban: the goat spittin fax
[0:54:15] foogity: You know what you‚Äôre bad against & meta
[0:54:15] Zapataboy: o7
[0:54:16] Huntsman095: thats why the vast majority of bans i see are just kapkan and fenrir. its not cause they expect people to play them, theyre just annoying
[0:54:16] SindreW: you can counter certain attacks or defenses that are good on specific maps
[0:54:18] kona_71: well on some maps you basically have to ban some ops
[0:54:20] easilyvv: @klnetics brother top white cam can hear the hatch being broken and the oryx grunting
[0:54:21] guatu1: not very good take
[0:54:24] benny2305: They might use ban data for nerfing ops
[0:54:24] gryffs: they should give more bans
[0:54:27] notCinn: its for annoying characters or characters specifically good on certain maps
[0:54:27] CheliosCS: fenrir and dokaebbi are the most banned cause they got pretty op gadgets
[0:54:27] sharp_cheddr: Mozzie acog NotLikeThis

[0:54:36] scott0_: siege cup
[0:54:37] wheelerdealer20: nah
[0:54:39] SlothFoSho: some people use a 3rd party add on that tells you top 3 ops for enemy
[0:54:40] Juryokkuu: rainbowsens
[0:54:41] NeonGifs: L take
[0:54:45] deltarmr: What about LEAGUE THEN?
[0:54:45] ACorporateSlave2: rainbow six tracker tells you what operators they use most
[0:54:48] okmafja: they use the ban to nerf ops
[0:54:49] Hungry_Panda91: before op bans, people would always play meta stuff so i kind of see why they are a thing
[0:54:49] xxPushDaButtonxx: Bruh who wouldve thought shroud on R6 would be my favorite passtime
[0:54:49] g0nza_a: i mean, if u dont wanna play against one specific character isnt that bad
[0:54:50] Rookiee09: it‚Äôs not, if you have a team of 3 or more you can ban someone who can counter a push you have planned for example @shroud
[0:54:53] ourleaf: it's a balancing band aid in case they fk up
[0:54:53] MarathonYT: @conorwayne how is fenrir easily countered by a manually controlled drone lmfaoooo

[0:54:58] Juryokkuu: !rainbowsens

[0:55:10] klnetics: @easilyvv on kafe yes but i was talking more in general cus theres no way you can hold all the cutoffs on a map like border or club
[0:55:12] Kenshiro_backhand: Jackal being banned every game is still a problem that's not fixed...
[0:55:15] corvus_55: @Nokiiiiiiiiiiiiii yes
[0:55:16] goungii: @nokiiiiiiiiiiiiii he used to play
[0:55:17] CCCrusade: It's to make balancing a little easier for devs. If something is imbalanced or overly annoying, community will self regulate that and ban it. Makes it a little less critical to balance patch things immediately
