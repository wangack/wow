[0:58:52] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, there is Defias Brotherhood and three quests in the Dwarven District of Stormwind (one by the well and two inside the inn-like structure). When you finish the chain from Lakeshire, you'll be able to pick up a quest on top of Sentinel Hill. And when you kill VanCleef, you'll pick up the Unsent Letter.
[0:59:06] Hebertongolongo: And you can tank

[1:00:26] Marin12VCF: :O
[1:00:33] bistraya_seledka: @Hebertongolongo, hybrid classes are perfect for the support role. Just nobody expects people to actually play support.
[1:00:43] ArukuGaming: @Hebertongolongo but oftentimes better than a master of one.

[1:02:12] bistraya_seledka: As long as hybrid classes preserve their mana, they usually are the ones who might safe the group in certain situations. Additional healing, shields, slow totems, second tank, etc. helps a lot.

[1:30:06] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, there's a quest to kill elite level 20 murloc ("The Coastal Menace") in Westfall that gives a shield (411 armour, 7 block, +3 spirit). Murloc poisons strongly, which could be deadly if not dispelled, but otherwise a fight against him is as against any other elite. There's also shield store in Old Town of Stormwind, I think.

[2:18:01] steinarfj80: can u buy throw or gun in sentinell hill???
[2:18:04] Scumbadger_: you can raid as a HC or become an Immortal
[2:18:11] Tomoglaziat: 5 toons died in BWL today all HC
[2:18:15] tasadormir: @Swifty poor warriors always dying xD
[2:18:33] Teagens: @Scumbadger_ What does that mean for HC when you become immortal?
[2:18:36] bistraya_seledka: @steinarfj80, there's a bow vendor by the fire near the entrance to the Hill, I think.
[2:18:50] Tomoglaziat: Guzu' raid btw
[2:19:02] steinarfj80: k ty
[2:19:15] israelelelel: any good movie recommendations @Swifty ?
[2:19:17] bistraya_seledka: @steinarfj80, general goods vendor might sell the weakest knives.
[2:19:22] demizt: thunder
[2:19:38] Tomoglaziat: you just have to leave HC guild if u die
[2:20:20] Aldever13: Good luck Swifty
[2:20:21] Scumbadger_: @Scumbadger_ if you choose to become immortal you can ress, but can't raid with other HC players
[2:20:27] Tomoglaziat: at 60
[2:20:34] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you can tell them not to pull in advance! Alliance players usually listen to those kind of things.
[2:21:49] Herzenliegen: lol lv 2

[2:25:59] Teagens: I know where all the quests and stuff are
[2:26:06] bistraya_seledka: too many*
[2:26:24] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you also have the quest from the gnome to collect some engineering thing.
[2:26:26] EmKay0710: You probably could just dual wild Tank.

[2:33:06] Tomoglaziat: almost always its a double caster issue lol
[2:33:13] Cowardpatty: This room....
[2:33:21] dizzyducc: lmao

[2:34:24] Cowardpatty: Why am I having dynamite PTSD then? lol
[2:34:39] bistraya_seledka: @preveralyax, they have a rogue. He alone can interrupt whole forge room. Not in this run, but still.
[2:35:13] bistraya_seledka: @preveralyax, and boat is not so hard if you look about. Only VanCleef probably, and only if you're not sure whom to target first.
[2:35:18] Cowardpatty: !redeem frogger

[2:37:02] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, @milbo55, sap + kick from rogue can exclude the fight against robots alltogether.
[2:37:06] preveralyax: We are talking about forge room

[3:38:01] aviduser2: damn swifty going strong!
[3:38:13] bistraya_seledka: WoW community is not very polite in general.
[3:38:32] purpleleaves_: Lol
[3:38:32] Slayer_Eagleone: :O report him now
[3:38:34] rezenthel: because you tried to skip the line ?
[3:38:37] my_skipper: lmaoo
[3:38:39] iberucks: wait im confused...what happens if you die?
[3:38:41] ottomonster: LOL
[3:38:41] BluesteelHD: because no one respecting the line
[3:38:43] TheEndIsNear777: they were all skippin line :(
[3:38:47] neskox: once upon a time people in classic behaved properly and formed a line
[3:38:49] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, was it a paladin or a warrior. Paladins who act like that are one of the worst kind.
[3:38:52] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[3:39:24] BluesteelHD: ppl respected lines up until a week ago when retail players came to HC, huuuge difference in type of player
[3:39:38] purpleleaves_: @iberucks  you delete and start over
[3:39:50] neskox: but i swear if i just died at lvl 30+ i would also be the biggest ahs till i reach lvl 20
[3:39:52] egorbaldin: people dying left and right
[3:40:05] DanielNA51: @BluesteelHD yes i observed that too- and typical hord player on ally
[3:40:06] bistraya_seledka: @iberucks, you delete your character and start over. There are also limitations on how you play.
[3:40:32] Bananadude_TV: where is peanut ?
[3:40:36] bistraya_seledka: @xtallbornx, some add-on notices it and you'll probably be not in favour among other hardcore players.
[3:40:37] BluesteelHD: no but you wont get to play with anyone
[3:40:37] kaydden18: Alot of times people open chests without auto loot on and link the gear inside to be rolled off btw Swifty
[3:40:39] Dibles714: Swifty playing HC on a WARRIOR just feels right!
[3:40:40] israelelelel: i'm leveling a disc priest, so fun
[3:40:48] neskox: @xtallbornx yes slow and painful
[3:41:07] Gashunk1: OpieOP
[3:41:12] BluesteelHD: @xtallbornx the addon tells all of us who is valid HC and we cant group with you ever if you are not
[3:41:23] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, did anybody share the quests with the group?
[3:41:35] purpleleaves_: swiftyHORDE swiftyALLIANCE

[3:42:08] Bananadude_TV: PEANUT

[3:42:59] Luthxx: xD
[3:42:59] inspect4: @bistraya_seledka cant remember but alot more than light leather
[3:43:00] geminae85: mine
[3:43:06] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, level 8 in Elwynn is probably killed in one of the mines.
[3:43:07] geminae85: kobold respawn kills mad people in elqynn
[3:43:12] CladStation: @Swifty  what the hardcore addon called ? so we know who dies
[3:43:13] surfbortt: Is rogue decent for hardcore? I played priest paladin and warlock in SoM, want something new but never played rogue much

[3:43:43] inspect4: @surfbortt yeah top class
[3:43:48] bistraya_seledka: @wakozya, it might not be worth it. Lesser magic wand from enchanting is ~5 silver and is worth 1 lesser essence + some shop materials. It should be better unless leather is really expensive.
[3:43:53] Kolstefan: Hi, do you think retail hardcore will be a success? Or?
[3:44:00] BluesteelHD: @surfbortt rogue is OK 1-22 then it becomes the best hc char
[3:44:27] surfbortt: Cool thanks o should get to it. Mine is level 2 lol starting zone was too full to do anything
[3:44:43] Vailliu5: quick question, is getting rested exp allowed or not allowed in hc?
[3:44:57] BluesteelHD: just play safe till 22 and dont do poison quest before you have vanish then
[3:44:59] benstilo: hc server and a new class: the griefer
[3:45:04] Snewgans: no, I don't think blizz will get it right.
[3:45:13] Beriech: It's allowed @themoneymankey You can't stop it.

[3:45:30] bistraya_seledka: @themoneymankey, it's extremelly hard not to get any of it, at least when you're visiting capital cities.
[3:45:35] jsalonsky94: So 2024 will be 20 years of classic wow, my guess is they bring it back for that
[3:45:41] surfbortt: @kapono it’s classic era server Bloodsail buccaneers
[3:45:57] krajcar99: Hydraxian Waterlords on EU

[3:46:07] Snewgans: why wold Blizz make a game mode without an AH? they wont be able to profit off bots.
[3:46:08] rhea_xiv: Hydraxian Waterlords is EU
[3:46:11] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, you still have blue flask to contact Onu in your primary bag that you'll never need again.
[3:46:15] BluesteelHD: they dont do that for diablo ect benny so id say they wont be doing appeals
[3:46:16] kapono: @surfbortt thanks
