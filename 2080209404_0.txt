[0:04:33] Andikkarm: I love the intro video.
[0:05:07] zannuss: Howdy
[0:05:13] averageteacup: hello there
[0:06:01] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:06:05] wolfcloudchaser80: G'morning! hazelWave
[0:06:11] tehl00py: good morning squirrels hazelWave
[0:06:16] mediocrity_squared: my lvl 11 warlock died when I misjudge a ledge ...and fell to my death...rookie mistake
[0:06:23] averageteacup: Today i bought The Color of Magic at last ... after years of procrastination! :D
[0:06:28] saga_no: I dunno if the addon needed is ported to Classic
[0:06:31] Bronloch: oi ello guvna <3
[0:06:38] saga_no: Oh ok - nevermind LUL
[0:07:04] aerissune: Stay away from the wendigos
[0:07:04] Hippwn: I would die so fast if i did that because my brain would be like wow on controller what do lol
[0:07:40] cydereal: ffxiv did console controller pretty well! does that consoleport addon try it the same way?
[0:08:03] GreenArrowed: ooh i forgot that
[0:09:15] saga_no: I've got half a mind to crank a couple of other classes (than priest) through unrated PvP for honor (for gear) to see if maybe I'd have an easier time with those...
[0:09:38] saga_no: Got a Paladin at 70 I could just crank through; but also like... a few 60-somethings I could get to 70
[0:10:09] tess_erzsebet: tess_erzsebet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[0:10:09] Streamlabs: tess_erzsebet just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:10:48] cydereal: when you're so used to playing this game a certain way it is a lot to learn ^^
[0:11:30] saga_no: I suppose Classic is easier to do with a controller too in that case... at least some classes will have fewer keybinds compared to retail
[0:11:46] just_some_lady: hopping out of my usual lurk to say i play WoW with a controller, it took a lil bit to get used to but i'd like to say i manage pretty well
[0:12:40] saga_no: Then again - I would struggle with swapping from the Tartarus keypad back to a normal keyboard, so... I'd definitely struggle with a controller for WoW I think; despite me *preferring* a controller for most other games
[0:12:47] cydereal: i watched a friend heal a raid with her steam controller and was amazed :D
[0:12:48] wolfcloudchaser80: The last controller system I used regularly was a SNES. Yeah, that long ago.
[0:12:55] Ujai321: you want to cheat?
[0:12:57] averageteacup: I click on abilities, 1-5 keys are for keyboard hand, everything else for the mouse
[0:13:11] Hippwn: I love the icons by the pet frame to indicate their happiness forgot about them
[0:13:25] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 OOh ooh - Zelda? Yeah?
[0:13:50] starmagicka: HCSF?
[0:14:06] Ujai321: i'm just making the joke (but not really) that looking things up on wowhead is cheating (for classic, specifically)
[0:14:10] Ujai321: also: morning :)
[0:14:36] sarritte: 6 levels is correct.
[0:14:49] Ujai321: Ujai321 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! finally, a watch streak!
[0:15:01] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Yeah, I kinda lived in Link to the Past as a kid. Just roaming around pretending I was in the world was often enough for me.
[0:15:32] Shirolol: wufPeek
[0:15:34] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I remember a friend down the street growing up had a SNES and was big on Zelda; the same friend taught me how to play chess ;P
[0:15:40] saga_no: when we were like 8 years old
[0:15:50] GreenArrowed: are you feeling better today? did you get better sleep?
[0:16:24] Ujai321: man, stuff sounds good
[0:16:37] Hippwn: lola the flying gator
[0:16:37] dilweed_: why does she have 6 legs? xD
[0:16:40] Ujai321: stuff to go to
[0:16:57] Ujai321: i will take it down a notch until the coffee is done, i guess ^^
[0:17:07] Perkolate: Her name was lola, she does have 6 legs.
[0:17:08] dilweed_: 20 years of wow and only now i realise crocs have 6 legs jeessus hahahaha
[0:17:10] averageteacup: The taurn player named Beefstew! LUL
[0:17:11] Perkolate: Perkolate watched 90 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:17:20] jgbrit: Hi Hazel, just in work. I'll catch you when I finish, see ya later hazelWave
[0:17:20] Ujai321: no, YOU have stuff to go to next week. and i said 'stuff sounds good'
[0:17:32] Ujai321: that whole exchange rapidly ceases to be worth it, i feel
[0:17:50] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Oddly, the only other Zelda game I ever played significantly was Zelda 2, and most people think that was the weird one that no one played.
[0:17:51] saga_no: 6 legs - ...makes me think of the movie Lola Rennt (Run Lola Run in English I think it was)
[0:18:09] honeybun_games: hulloooo! happy sunday! hows the journey
[0:18:16] Ujai321: right, dentist sounds mid, but cavities filling seems like a good idea
[0:18:17] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Is that the one that released with / for the SNES - cuz that was the one my friend had in that case
[0:18:36] TotallyNotRaien: just DIY cavity filling, im sure theres something somewhere on tiktok
[0:18:54] honeybun_games: you inspired me to make a hunter as well in HCSF, although mine is a NE
[0:19:26] GreenArrowed: last time i went to get my cavities filled they found more cavities to fill the dentist and dental insurance is a scam NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:19:27] saga_no: Aaw <3
[0:19:41] saga_no: And before people start...
[0:19:42] saga_no: !we
[0:19:42] Streamlabs: Hazel has a Partner. That is all we know. :) And we respect their privacy, so Mystery Partner will remain Mysterious until Hazel decides otherwise.
[0:19:59] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Link to the Past was the one from the early days of SNES (introduced things like the hookshot). Zelda 2 was a side-scroller on the NES, and was... hard.
[0:20:03] GreenArrowed: @saga_no proactive
[0:20:36] cydereal: i need a dentist to tell me hard truths but not shame me, a fine line D:
[0:20:59] TotallyNotRaien: i like it when healthcare professionals acknowledge that some people are poor and cant afford certain things
[0:21:14] GreenArrowed: it's such an intimate dr appt, they have their hands in yoru mouth for like, an hour. it's great when you find someone you're happy to go see
[0:21:22] averageteacup: At my dentist office, they have a bowl of free chocolate ... this was confusing a little :D
[0:21:40] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 It was probably Link to the Past then - I remember getting to play it at my friend's house (I didn't have a console at home)
[0:22:01] GreenArrowed: @averageteacup i left my childhood dentist with a fistful of dumdums every time, i didn't really think about it until i was older
[0:23:09] caffeinated_zombee: when in doubt green it out lol
[0:23:18] averageteacup: @GreenArrowed yeah .. this should be illegal LUL
[0:23:21] NordicSorcerer: iirc, link to the past was also on ? Or maybe it was 3DS?
[0:23:39] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer I have it on my GBA I think?
[0:23:53] GreenArrowed: reminding me i really need to go to the dentist
[0:24:04] NordicSorcerer: GBA is quite possible...
[0:24:05] saga_no: When in doubt - stay in green quests
[0:25:05] saga_no: Dental care here (for adults) is ...absolutely ridiculously priced
[0:25:20] caffeinated_zombee: @hazelnuttygames  do you think your gonna get more tats eventually? croaki2UWU
[0:26:18] caffeinated_zombee: would you ever get a neck tattoo?
[0:26:19] saga_no: Thoughts on placement of future tattoos?
[0:26:25] TotallyNotRaien: so you wouldnt rush out and get a tattoo of lola rn? smh
[0:26:29] watchCrimson: hello, can you guys help me a bit? The archeologi archavist thing in Dragonflight, the one with candelabra, how often can you gain their currency?
[0:26:37] des_olation: I use to get tattooed like every six months now I work in a shop and I wait years to get them now
[0:26:37] Ujai321: how about another maple leaf?
[0:26:38] GreenArrowed: i love the process of getting tattoos, i also really love my artists, it's so nice to sit for 3.5 hrs and catch up on the last 9 months
[0:26:53] GreenArrowed: @Ujai321 with a canadian flag
[0:27:34] caffeinated_zombee: @hazelnuttygames  any wow themed tats?
[0:27:35] saga_no: If I had the money for it, I would be decked out in pretty ink
[0:28:12] watchCrimson: all I want out of there are just the glasses :D
[0:28:35] TotallyNotRaien: well mother nature will want to talk to your lawyers
[0:28:38] caffeinated_zombee: @hazelnuttygames do you ever go to blizz cons?
[0:28:50] Alastree: Hi Hazel
[0:29:08] cinnatoasto_: Is it possible to get tattoo ink that has a metallic shine to it?
[0:29:16] des_olation: Nope
[0:29:26] caffeinated_zombee: @hazelnuttygames  I would love to see you in a future blizzcon! I’m a big fan croaki2UWU
[0:29:34] des_olation: You cat get metallic ink
[0:29:37] des_olation: Cant*
[0:29:40] Ujai321: hold on, you are depriving us of a good look at a DEER!?
[0:29:40] GreenArrowed: no, but some artists are really good at making regular ink look metallic
[0:29:41] saga_no: @cinnatoasto_ I doubt it - but I assume some tattoo artists can do shading that mimics the effect of it
[0:29:43] Ujai321: unsubscribed
[0:29:55] IAmScarlett__: hello hi hai bonjour
[0:30:03] des_olation: I work in a tattoo shop that is a common question, it's all skill
[0:30:14] saga_no: @HazelNuttyGames Au contraire - yer stuck with me now! ;D
[0:30:40] IAmScarlett__: IAmScarlett__ watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! here have this too
[0:31:00] caffeinated_zombee: jackof45Coffeefroggo jackof45Coffeefroggo jackof45Coffeefroggo
[0:31:19] Ujai321: man, that movie always reminds me of how stupid german movie stuff is
[0:31:28] aerissune: It's a beautiful day here and I'm off to touch ...weeds, then pull them out. DON'T DIE! hazelPlant hazelLove
[0:31:35] Ujai321: so, movies in germany get dubbed
[0:31:37] Akimbo_UK: For me that was Step Brothers, That was my nightly DVD to fall asleep to and wake up to the main menu music on loop :D
[0:31:43] IAmScarlett__: thats an obsurdly big bow
[0:32:01] saga_no: brb
[0:32:06] Ujai321: and often times, the titles get changed, if the distributor thinks people dont understand the title
[0:32:26] Ujai321: so 'Bend it like Beckham' is called 'Kick it like Beckham' in germany
[0:32:27] IndigoCat: For me, a comfort movie like that would be Little Women, the 90s version with Winona Ryder and Christian Bale
[0:32:29] Ujai321: and i hate it
[0:32:42] GreenArrowed: lol that's great
[0:33:07] caradosailanthus: Kick it like Harry Kane
[0:33:19] cydereal: fifth element comfort favorite bloopi7Love
[0:33:22] caffeinated_zombee: @hazelnuttygames did you cosplay at all during blizzcon?
[0:33:28] Ujai321: my least favorite example for that is the movie 'Cradle 2 the Grave'
[0:33:30] GreenArrowed: lol yes
[0:33:59] Ujai321: i assume they thought "germans will never understand what that means. it's english, it's a kind of niche expression. better change it"
[0:33:59] IndigoCat: In Little Women, he'd be older than that but still a baby, comapared to his Batman days anyways LUL
[0:34:09] Ujai321: and now it is called BORN 2 DIE
[0:34:15] Ujai321: really grinds my gears
[0:34:39] Ujai321: they arent doing it as much now, thankfully
[0:35:01] Ujai321: have you ever experienced me taking anything exxcessively literally?
[0:35:11] NickSarien: we have amazingly bad idioms
[0:35:14] Simda: we Germans are very direct
[0:35:24] TotallyNotRaien: hazel is secretly german
[0:35:41] caffeinated_zombee: jackof45SkullyCoffee jackof45SkullyCoffee jackof45SkullyCoffee
[0:35:59] Ujai321: you know the "how many X does it take to change a lightbulb?", followed by a usually pretty racist sterotype?
[0:36:23] Ujai321: for germans, it's 1. because we are efficient and dont have humor.
[0:36:29] NickSarien: british in british columbia, does that get you like bonus points?
[0:37:39] NickSarien: oof right
[0:37:46] Ujai321: it's pennance, really
[0:37:55] jeffdmk: wow you think i have a sense of humor?
[0:37:58] wolfcloudchaser80: Gotta love corporate slogan translations. Pepsi once had "Come alive with the Pepsi generation" which was translated in the Philippines to something closer to "Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the dead"
[0:38:24] Ujai321: what a claim
[0:38:33] Ujai321: surely that's a lawsuit waiting to happen
[0:38:58] caffeinated_zombee: tyedie2Raininghearts tyedie2Goodvibes tyedie2Raininghearts
[0:39:04] GeneralDumle: i miss the old pepsi commercials where they raved and ran from the rising sun LUL
[0:39:43] wolfcloudchaser80: I know. Some people were probably depending on grandpa coming back to tell them where the family money was hidden.
[0:39:56] TotallyNotRaien: if i do watch a video ad im always too busy exasperated trying to skip it
[0:40:09] caffeinated_zombee: jackof45Twerkbean jackof45Twerkbean jackof45Twerkbean
[0:41:58] jeffdmk: are there lots of rares in barrens in hardcore?
[0:42:08] caffeinated_zombee: croaki2O7 croaki2O7 croaki2O7
[0:42:25] wolfcloudchaser80: Ugh. I'm trying to learn pres evoker by doing follower dungeons. I'm too used to resto druid and this is challenging.
[0:42:32] jeffdmk: pretty close
[0:42:37] Ujai321: i love zebra teriyaki
[0:42:39] kynlaeh: teriyaki? like the umami sauce lol
[0:42:56] TotallyNotRaien: maybe youre just hungry
[0:43:11] renddii: Ah yes, the wild teriyakis that travel on the plains

[0:43:44] GreenArrowed: ah yes, the chopper incident
[0:43:45] Ujai321: oh no, your squeezers
[0:44:04] saga_no: ....aaaand back
[0:44:27] saga_no: Wait - what did we (nearly) cut off?
[0:44:27] Ujai321: i'm curious how yours holds up. we broke ours... too many root vegetables, i guess
[0:44:29] jeffdmk: is having 9 fingers going to decrease your dps?
[0:44:42] LouOfc: Finally finished all the legion order halls, hope they do a similar thing in the future, it was great
[0:44:50] gherkinslice: I am so clumsy with those! My husband bought me a glove with metal threads woven in, so I dont cut myself xD
[0:45:03] NickSarien: 9 fingers, and a nose!
[0:45:07] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Good Morning Hazel! Just saw your Saturday show, so sorry you are under the weather!
[0:45:07] Streamlabs: beorn_of_the_northernsea just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:45:24] NordicSorcerer: @jeffdmk Potentially. Fewer fingers to control mouse and controller buttons (can be solved with some creativity and other control devices) ;)
[0:45:28] cydereal: i own myself on a potato peeler like once a year
[0:45:33] cydereal: and i cook a ton so i feel so dumb when i do it
[0:46:12] Ujai321: i always think that when i choke on a drink
[0:46:16] wolfcloudchaser80: I once had an incident with a hatchet. And my thumb. My partner had to patch me up and she forbade me from handling a hatchet since.
[0:46:22] Ujai321: "x years old, still havent learned how to drink properly"
[0:46:24] GreenArrowed: i still do very dumb things in the kitchen out of absolutely no where. i've stuck my hand in a hours hot oven with no mit or towel
[0:46:53] jeffdmk: partially metal gloves are a really good idea
[0:47:18] saga_no: My Dad taught me how to safely use a knife when I  was like 3 years old, and then gifted me a knife (called a Scout's knife here; smaller, made for children)
[0:47:19] gherkinslice: I don't xD
[0:47:22] averageteacup: that voice is good for a cartoon character :D
[0:47:26] jeffdmk: you normally only get one hand
[0:47:31] Ujai321: it's 0.01 gold, so. a lot of gold
[0:47:53] Ujai321: it's no good on your squeeeeezers
[0:48:03] TotallyNotRaien: they are satan
[0:48:20] NickSarien: is partner a wizard?
[0:48:33] saga_no: Yeah some people just have "chef fingers" like that
[0:48:44] Ujai321: i had a roommate once who didnt feel heat on their hands. super freaky
[0:48:44] wolfcloudchaser80: That's like our house. Our water heater is set to kill. Full hot water is probably as dangerous as a knife.
[0:49:04] kynlaeh: my partner can pull things out of the oven without any cloth or anything and it scares me
[0:49:09] Ujai321: we turned the boiler up one day. she only realized when she got minor burns while washing a thing
[0:49:10] saga_no: Like - I've seen chefs put their fingers in a bubbling deep fryer to flip things in it...
[0:49:15] sk8rbunn: kitchen hands. callus' help. I can pull potatoes outta the oven barehanded
[0:50:20] averageteacup: Pinkace the Warlock .. 24 levels!
[0:50:31] saga_no: tbf, the chefs I've seen do it were flipping things that were on the surface of the oil, so they weren't submerging their hands into the fryer
[0:50:39] GreenArrowed: barrens, dangerous
[0:51:17] cydereal: it does great ramen broth
[0:52:08] GreenArrowed: scraps!
[0:52:10] GreenArrowed: yes!
[0:52:14] saga_no: Scrap broth is the best broth
[0:52:15] Ujai321: in their freeezers
[0:52:22] GreenArrowed: but you have to add some fresh things
[0:52:32] sarritte: a stock pot is a great investment. you will use it forever!
[0:52:33] mediocrity_squared: if you roast your veggies first that helps the flavor too
[0:52:35] jeffdmk: I have never tried compost
[0:52:46] GreenArrowed: you gotta add good fresh onion, garlic and celery
[0:52:49] caradosailanthus: Avoid broccoli, kale, anything from the cruciferious family
[0:52:58] sarritte: (also making a grocery list for vegetable soup tonight - thanks for the inspiration)
[0:53:03] saga_no: Whenever my aunt whipped up a
[0:53:11] saga_no: scrap broth - she'd only use root veggies
[0:53:35] GreenArrowed: i also like to add dried mushrooms
[0:53:44] Ujai321: but you canned that idea?
[0:54:19] sarritte: it’s big but it’s solid - I’ve had mine for 20 years and it’s still going strong. Mine has a steamer basket in it, so I steam dumplings in it too!
[0:54:19] saga_no: My aunt would grab root veggie scraps from the freezer, and then just throw in some fresh stuff - like if she had an extra potato or carrot from the day before, she'd just throw that in
[0:54:38] kynlaeh: mushrooms reminded me, i made a mushroom bisque and it was exquisite
[0:56:00] GreenArrowed: since you eat fish, dashi might be a nice addition to a stock. wouldn't be veggie anymore, but it's so rich.
[0:56:06] jeffdmk: You seem like you are feeling much better today.
[0:56:16] Ujai321: can always DropTheCheapestThing (tm)
[0:57:01] saga_no: Yeeeaaah.... after like 6 weeks of it you get kinda bored... LUL
[0:57:07] Ujai321: have you done the sinus drain thing?
[0:57:29] Saiyori: netti pots are amazing, ive used one for years
[0:57:31] Ujai321: no, it's just a hold on your face you do for a few seconds
[0:57:36] NickSarien: steam baths?
[0:57:44] Hippwn: they are kind of fun to use lol
[0:57:45] jamien_10: nettipot feels super weird but its great
[0:58:11] saga_no: I do the "spicy menthol under my nose" to help the drainage - along with sinus sprays
[0:58:19] wolfcloudchaser80: I've heard too many stories of netti pots causing infections.
[0:58:46] saga_no: Anything to make myself having to blow my nose; also because it lets me monitor if it's infected or not - gross, I know - but true
[0:58:47] Ujai321: you can check youtube in your break. 'drain sinus' or whatever. lots of shorts about it
[0:58:48] GreenArrowed: People don't clean them. like they don't lean humidifiers.
[0:58:50] jamien_10: you just have to keep it clean and use distilled/boiled water
[0:59:07] Ujai321: welp, no choice but to suffer, then
[1:00:13] Saiyori: distilled water and the correct kind of salt, wash it with soap every time you use it and you're golden
[1:00:21] Ujai321: not THAT much more
[1:00:28] saga_no: My years of chronic ear infections as a kid makes me a bit more aware of certain respiratory/sinus infections
[1:00:28] jeffdmk: I wonder if you will get to 1g today
[1:00:37] Ujai321: what is your over/under bet on if you make it to 40?
[1:01:03] cheesy_tater: cheesy_tater watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! themus62CatDance3

[1:02:34] GattsuGaming: woo self found grats on 13!
[1:03:02] voidmuse: i would've never made it out of the single digits

[1:06:00] Hippwn: It would be like Hazel will get to level 20 now wager if hazel will level over 20 or level under 20 hope that helps a little
[1:08:05] saga_no: It is - yeah ;P
[1:08:08] saga_no: Nordic plays it too
[1:08:10] IkeIsHere: i actually got into hs again because i was watching you play haha
[1:08:17] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup, I'm an aviation-nerd.
[1:08:34] Ujai321: you ooze, you loose (your bodily intergrity)
[1:09:40] jeffdmk: oh can i change my bet today?
[1:10:50] Ujai321: 'you, spider! teach my crocodile how to bite better!'
[1:11:05] Ujai321: (i know the spider teaches you, so you can teach your croc, it's fine)
[1:12:09] Ujai321: it was a different time
[1:15:04] Ujai321: a real archanophobe
[1:16:22] apheelia96: good afternoon!
[1:16:34] Perkolate: :O
[1:16:37] GreenArrowed: oooh
[1:16:47] GreenArrowed: you've had some good green drops
[1:16:51] apheelia96: so far so good
[1:17:35] apheelia96: how much did I miss? you still gonna be on a bit longer?
[1:17:59] apheelia96: awesome glad your feeling better
[1:18:01] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 The ornithopter does absolutely not behave like a rotorcraft when you flare before hover+touchdown. Don't ask how I know.
[1:19:41] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Ah, that thing behaves SO strangely in the in-between stages. It either wants to hover or GOGOGO. But man, you can do some crazy stunts in it.
[1:20:39] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 I'm actually a tad disappointed in its stunt-capabilities. Probably because I compare it to flying a ThunderTiger Raptor 50 v2, and not any MSFS craft... :P
[1:20:43] jeffdmk: is it still worth feeding or could you just let the spider leave
[1:21:06] PeModyne: Save it for hardcore cataclysm =^)
[1:21:17] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Then again, the TTRaptors doesn't fly, it simply beats the air into submission. :P
[1:21:27] cyclopsnerd: that robe was just re-added to retail with 10.1.7 :)
[1:22:08] apheelia96: im level 7 and only have 9 silver. dont think i like the no auction house thing lol
[1:22:12] Elrathir: where is lola
[1:22:15] saga_no: I think Imma dip - brain be spicin' and I'm already exhausted
[1:22:19] Elrathir: what have you done to her??
[1:22:29] Eirchi: Hi Hazel! Floyd here now!
[1:22:33] cashthb: sup quenn? 😍😍😍
[1:22:48] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Had to look that up... and oh god, one of those buz-saw RC helicopters? I love watching those, but I know I'd create a mass casualty even if I ever tried one. I just got a nice, tame DJI mini 3 that I'm learning.
[1:23:00] wolfcloudchaser80: even=event
[1:23:20] cashthb: not much, watched the new dune, it's poop
[1:23:40] Eirchi: Lola!? Is she  a showgirl With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there?
[1:23:49] apheelia96: well now when I dont do self found I feel like a wimpy cheater :)
[1:24:17] jeffdmk: @apheelia96 you are
[1:24:39] apheelia96: lol
[1:24:51] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 I used to fly competively. 3DMasters-style. Notice "Used to". More than two decades ago. If you really want to know what a Raptor can do, search for "Alan Szabo Sunday at the lake" on Youtube. That's with a Raptor 30 (the smaller sibling of the 50. Differences is mainly that the 50 has an even more agressive weight-power ratio, and lower rotor disc loading)...
[1:25:18] jeffdmk: at least in retail it is just a setting
[1:25:19] NordicSorcerer: (And no - I was never anywhere near Alan Szabo's skill levels)
[1:26:18] Eirchi: or did you meet Lola in a club in old Soho, Where you drink Champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola C-O-L-A, Cola
[1:26:54] jeffdmk: i wonder if the self found numbers would be much different then the regular hardcore numbers
[1:27:38] Eirchi: Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy, But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine, Lola
[1:27:44] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer That name sounds pretty familiar, maybe I've come across a video once before. There's a state park not far from here that hosts a RC club and even has a substantial paved runways setup for the serious RC planes. I'm hoping to go once winter is less wintery.
[1:28:03] averageteacup: the /rude emote for dwarf is funny :D
[1:28:03] maidhco: some nice humanoid experiementation
[1:28:05] GreenArrowed: noooo champyun
[1:28:12] Elrathir: wow you just murdered that friendly dwarf :( he did nothing wrong :(
[1:29:26] Elrathir: that was magni's cousin :( poor mugni, cousin of magni :( may he rest in peace :(
[1:29:59] jeffdmk: @Elrathir i am guessing hazel is just mad about more dwarfs in the next expac instead of something cooler
[1:30:31] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Alan and his brother has been in the top-5 worldwide RC Heli pilots for 3 decades. But the video I mentioned shows fairly well why it takes "a bit" to impress me with an aircraft's stunt capabilities (I still have my Raptor50 sitting on the shelf behind me, but before that beast gets any airtime, it will need a complete stripdown and rebuild, and I intend to get a good newbie-copter to retrain reflexes before I fly something that is essentially an unshielded lawnmower)
[1:31:39] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 1345mm rotor diameter (600mm blades + head), at 2000 rpm means ... respect it always. That thing is dangerous.
[1:32:55] NordicSorcerer: KITTEH! <3
[1:33:18] MrSonicgen: Hello all.
[1:33:30] Eirchi: I just started working on Ember Court, guess I'm a little late to the party
[1:34:13] GreenArrowed: there was some trader post achievements for it i think
[1:34:55] NordicSorcerer: aaanyways, I'm gonna go check on what ails my wife (she seems a little under the wind), and make sure she feels as appreciated as she actually is. I'll be back another day. :)
[1:35:04] jeffdmk: how much do we know about the mail system in azeroth?
[1:36:19] russtrotter: anyone else get dizzy on DMF merry go round?  i get queezy if i watch my screen while i'm going around :-(
[1:36:22] jeffdmk: I am just wondering why we end up delivering so many letters
[1:36:33] cashthb: have you tried rum in your tea?
[1:37:10] apheelia96: I drink tea in the morning so rum not so much
[1:37:32] jeffdmk: rum in the morning seems fine
[1:37:35] GreenArrowed: idk those shaped buildings are sometimes dangerous
[1:37:41] Eirchi: Hazel, do you have Sinrunner Blanchy?
[1:37:47] cashthb: i mean... people drink tea with rum, it prolly works way better than garlic or ginger
[1:38:37] Elrathir: pro tip: don't get eaten by horses
[1:38:41] apheelia96: I love greek mythology names
[1:38:51] wolfcloudchaser80: So is Victoria as overcast and gloomy as MSFS says it is right now? These are some low clouds.
[1:39:11] jeffdmk: your pet has a really awkward run animation
[1:39:36] apheelia96: I do that like if the name Apheelia is taken I would spell it Apheeliah
[1:39:44] caradosailanthus: I use mostly all plant and flower names
[1:39:53] TotallyNotRaien: she worked really hard to train lola to run like that
[1:39:58] GreenArrowed: i just can't believe i didn't know they had 6 legs until yesterday
[1:40:11] cashthb: I recently saw a video of a baby chick being swooped up by a horse... so if you meet a big enough horse it might well just eat you
[1:40:45] Elrathir: they eat crocolisks
[1:40:47] Elrathir: watch out
[1:40:54] TotallyNotRaien: they eat horse food duh
[1:41:07] GreenArrowed: oats and carrots and apples
[1:41:23] cashthb: off topic but: damn those parallax less 2d field textures are hot
[1:41:37] Eirchi: don't get me started on aunt vs ant
[1:42:06] GreenArrowed: and english (and other language) is forever morphing
[1:42:23] jeffdmk: agreed you are a bug
[1:42:40] Elrathir: what is the worst bug?
[1:42:43] cashthb: wow, you can lift 8 times your body weight then: :O
[1:42:50] kboyyyyy: if i sait aunt id say it like aunt but auntie i say like antie
[1:42:53] jeffdmk: especially a female ant
[1:43:10] Elrathir: lol the INSTANT change of mind
[1:43:34] Eirchi: mosquitos kill millions per year, so that's bad
[1:43:50] foxieloxiee: Hello
[1:43:57] honeybun_games: ever since moving to Ottawa, my house has so... many... spiders.... and let's just say i don't love it lol
[1:44:02] kboyyyyy: youd rather get stung by a wasp then stung by mosquito? weird take
[1:44:07] GreenArrowed: looool
[1:44:15] Kalaila_: helloo3Cry
[1:44:28] apheelia96: I dont like either
[1:44:34] kboyyyyy: so if they were both tryna sting you, youd kill the mosquito first
[1:44:50] jeffdmk: There is no doubt that mosuitos kill way more people then wasps
[1:44:57] honeybun_games: I look up at the ceiling from my computer.. BAM spider xD
[1:44:58] Eirchi: I am addicted to those Australian wolf spider videos
[1:45:31] jeffdmk: you havent seen those?
[1:45:35] cheesy_tater: do you have giant house spiders in Canada?
[1:45:47] cashthb: what about snakes? there was on old "just australian things" meme where a smol snake got stuck in a spider web and a spooder was closing up on it
[1:45:54] Zuldak: I used to watch a guy get stung on purpose by insects trying to find the most painful sting
[1:46:04] zannuss: I hate banana spiders, they creep me out
[1:46:05] cheesy_tater: I'm in the PNW fall is spider hell
[1:46:13] GreenArrowed: weird hobby
[1:46:31] Elrathir: I now regret bringing us onto the topic of the worst bug. I kinda don't like bugs ya'll
[1:46:34] cheesy_tater: LOL
[1:46:40] Kalaila_: agreed
[1:46:42] cashthb: not gonna ellaborate but that the image of that gif did help me now-and-then
[1:46:47] zannuss: ok topic change
[1:46:52] jeffdmk: att solo self found
[1:46:54] Zuldak: Does Canada do daylight savings
[1:46:57] cheesy_tater: themus62ThumbsUpCat
[1:47:02] GreenArrowed: lifestyke inflation
[1:47:03] zannuss: I got stupid lucky a couple days ago and got the sha and oondasta mounts back to back
[1:47:09] GreenArrowed: lifestyle*
[1:47:15] Zuldak: Oregon legislatures chickened out of taking oregon out of the fall back thing
[1:47:18] Elrathir: @zannuss ooh grats!
[1:47:24] GreenArrowed: @zannuss gg
[1:47:46] IndigoCat: @Zuldak We don't in Saskatchewan!
[1:47:51] Zuldak: Oregon didn't want to create our own time zone for Vancouver commuters
[1:47:52] zannuss: got the sha one on a bonus roll too so even stupider luck
[1:48:00] caiouke: do ya'll think WoW is ever coming to xbox gamepass?
[1:48:03] IndigoCat: I have never changed time
[1:48:19] zannuss: which means I now have better luck at getting world boss mounts then I do an orange axe
[1:48:20] AmiYuy: Wait bonus rolls work for mounts?
[1:48:24] Zuldak: I think wow is coming to game pass in some form
[1:48:44] AmiYuy: What... Thank you!
[1:48:51] zannuss: and galleon and nalak
[1:48:53] Zuldak: The thing is that the wow sub is super stable and it's a cash cow.
[1:49:04] caiouke: @Zuldak well maybe just the sub? but I can't see them adding the expacs to it
[1:49:14] cashthb: as I mentioned before, game pass is like 2/3 the price of a wow sub here, so I highly doubt it
[1:49:34] Caistra: As someone who has only really had English breakfast tea, what kind do you suggest trying?
[1:49:38] jeffdmk: that is my feeling too
[1:49:58] melph: Assam tea
[1:50:00] Zuldak: Maybe only wow classic would be on the game pass
[1:50:14] zannuss: And tokens
[1:50:50] zannuss: I got a couple friends that decided they wanted to try wrath classic and reactivated subs that have been dead for like 10 years and then bought several tokens
[1:51:00] Zuldak: Tea. Earl grey. Hot
[1:51:13] CoffeeASAP: gunpowder teas are tasty and interesting
[1:51:19] cashthb: whit that midset I think they would have gone f2p like 10 years ago, server maintanace costs like nothing nowadays, they must really like the income from subs
[1:51:29] chriskg68: Republic of Tea - Lucky Irish Black Tea, I drink that every day
[1:51:35] Arabany: Tokens are the biggest income source, most likely over half of the total income if not more.
[1:52:00] Arabany: Experience:)
[1:52:16] cashthb: is there a coffee tea?
[1:52:27] Zuldak: I remember Teavana and their samples
[1:52:31] cashthb: if there's not that's my billion dollar idea, don't steal it
[1:52:36] zannuss: Isn't coffee technically tea anyway
[1:52:48] NickSarien: it's all soup
[1:52:57] Zuldak: Coffee is hot filtered bean juice
[1:52:58] kynlaeh: whats a good fruity tea for someone that wants to get into tea drinking?
[1:52:58] zannuss: ^
[1:53:07] zannuss: So coffee is bean soup confirmed
[1:53:17] cardfrek: @NickSarien yum, leaf soup and bean soup
[1:53:32] honeybun_games: neat! learned something new!
[1:53:34] Eirchi: will this be on the final?
[1:53:35] Andikkarm: damn, that is good knowledge
[1:53:41] Zuldak: I'm making a potato cream soup later
[1:53:42] NickSarien: good hot bean soup
[1:54:16] cashthb: wait so ayahuasca's not tea? i might have lied to police then
[1:54:22] caiouke: istn't camelia sinensis tea just black or green tea?
[1:54:24] GreenArrowed: yeeea
[1:54:24] Zuldak: It's like Starbucks cream and sugar with like 1 shot of coffee
[1:54:46] cardfrek: what's kombucha then?
[1:55:15] Zuldak: Kombucha is hippy beer
[1:55:17] GreenArrowed: there's a boutique tea shop here that sells extremely expensive blends but they're mostly herbs anf flowers
[1:55:40] Hippwn: I thought red tea and black tea were the same and they just call it red tea in China and some other crountries
[1:55:58] Zuldak: Do you ever get artificially flavored coffee?
[1:56:39] TotallyNotRaien: soon youll start liking licorice
[1:56:43] Ujai321: a better personal preference
[1:56:49] apheelia96: For crying out loud! I need tinder to cook! hazelYikes
[1:56:56] Elrathir: what kind of tea does lola like
[1:57:06] cashthb: how dare you?!
[1:57:16] jeffdmk: your taste buds die off pretty quickly as you age
[1:57:23] cashthb: og fishermens friends are the best!
[1:57:37] apheelia96: Im a troll. Made it when you made yours :)
[1:57:41] jeffdmk: @Elrathir whatever lola wants lola gets
[1:57:47] GreenArrowed: i really grew into specific anise flavors.
[1:57:52] Ujai321: Ujai321 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! so, just so you know: i cancelled Amazon Prime, so now I'm actually giving you real money. no more FREE PRIME SUBS for me
[1:57:53] Streamlabs: ujai321 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:57:56] tydyemoon: hi! hows SF so far, I finally got time to start mine last night!
[1:57:59] Zuldak: If you need to clear sinuses asap a dollop of Wasabi will clear you out
[1:58:03] apheelia96: lol
[1:58:43] Eirchi: Just bust out Pierre, he's a pet and a cook fire!
[1:58:45] jeffdmk: @Ujai321 congrats on cancelling amazong prime i recently did the same, it is wonderful
[1:58:55] theonerune: I recently found a new tea you might enjoy...it really is a true novelty
[1:59:08] Zuldak: I keep Amazon prime for the prime gaming and twitch sub.
[1:59:28] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a good one.
[1:59:34] Zuldak: Moose gets the 40 lb bagsm
[1:59:39] Zuldak: Bags*
[1:59:47] Eirchi: Does Moose say vase or vaaaase?
[2:00:21] NickSarien: NickSarien subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! Did somebody say free prime subs?
[2:00:21] Streamlabs: nicksarien just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:00:38] zannuss: So since its now March, do you think they will give us at least a date for 10.2.6 or it will just show up on a tuesday without any notice
[2:00:45] Zuldak: Much more German shepard than husky then. My cousin has a husky who is nothing but grumbles, whines and moans
[2:01:02] CurrentsWoW: wth, i want my tabards to keep me warm, no frosty :(
[2:01:05] zannuss: Max has teased that he knows whats in the patch
[2:01:14] jeffdmk: if they just dropped it that would be very cool
[2:01:20] rtsplanner: that was my thought with tomorrow's weird maintenance
[2:01:22] NickSarien: Is this is OG Currents?
[2:01:29] NickSarien: *the
[2:01:30] xgugga: wait, drop what? :D
[2:01:37] CurrentsWoW: @NickSarien HOLY SHIT NICK HOW YOU BEEN
[2:01:46] cashthb: idk if I love that flat textures or the static shadows more
[2:02:09] NickSarien: @CurrentsWoW Working a whole bunch, but back for a bit, we'll see what happens :)
[2:02:10] MichaTx: Hello all :)
[2:02:15] MichaTx: MichaTx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:02:23] cashthb: that's what I'm saying, remings me of gothic
[2:02:31] Eirchi: Man, there are a lot of party people to rep out
[2:02:38] cashthb: or half life
[2:02:38] CurrentsWoW: @NickSarien <3
[2:02:41] MichaTx: ive been lazy after a hard work week lol
[2:02:42] Zuldak: There was a time in gaming where 3d gaming was polygons you could see the pixels
[2:03:00] NickSarien: @CurrentsWoW Good to see you around, how's life?
[2:03:36] MichaTx: I had my comp away for repairs for 2 weeks :( Had no way to play....going to get on WoW soon lol need to get some gaming in the system before another work week lol
[2:03:38] Zuldak: You should try ember court once more. It's really not terrible. Especially if you do it enough to get the guests to vip
[2:04:09] apheelia96: I feel like I will die before I ever get a mount!
[2:04:10] CurrentsWoW: @NickSarien work, gym, sleep repeat -> sneak gametime in wherever possible
[2:04:14] Eirchi: This would be even more hardcore if you couldn't command your pet and he just moved and attacked randomly
[2:04:14] Elrathir: if lola was real would she and moose be friends
[2:04:32] apheelia96: lol
[2:04:58] CurrentsWoW: bless you
[2:05:05] MichaTx: I made 2 new toons before the repairs and want to try them out lol (Void elf and Nightborne)
[2:05:25] MichaTx: of course hunters lol
[2:05:33] Zuldak: So any plans over your weekend?
[2:05:39] Elrathir: yes but consider the power of their potential friendship
[2:05:45] cashthb: Moose is also a carnivore, I think the senseless killing machine part is your issue
[2:06:21] MichaTx: hows your weather over there Hazel? we got the big snow dump of the year over here lol
[2:06:37] CurrentsWoW: my dog has big time cucumber addiction
[2:06:51] MichaTx: dang nice

[2:07:31] jamien_10: eastern bc got a big dump of snow too
[2:07:50] MichaTx: we just got more yesterday
[2:08:10] Zuldak: I've been to Houston TX twice. Its..It's... an experience.
[2:08:16] cashthb: btw why do you have friendly nameplates on?
[2:08:17] MichaTx: when I can be where it's warm year round, I will be happy hahaha
[2:08:25] Zuldak: Felt like a foreign country compared to my norm
[2:08:34] Eirchi: wait, you're using some sort of omnibag now?
[2:08:35] MichaTx: my hubby lives near Dallas
[2:08:58] chriskg68: You all please keep the snow in the North, lol, in Southern MO it is an unusual 75F out today
[2:09:06] CurrentsWoW: damn
[2:09:11] CurrentsWoW: the seal has been broken
[2:09:18] Eirchi: All my exes are in Texas
[2:09:22] CurrentsWoW: years of telling people you don't like megabags
[2:09:23] CurrentsWoW: :D
[2:09:27] cashthb: do you know Alex Jones? :O
[2:09:43] Zuldak: I'm glad we got a bunch of rain this winter. No drought worries
[2:10:05] MichaTx: @Eirchi lol all mine are here in Alberta...I don't mind moving away lol
[2:11:19] jeffdmk: 1g
[2:11:34] CurrentsWoW: PogChamp
[2:11:41] Eirchi: You should go get Thori'dal from the Sunwell so you don't have to buy arrows anymore
[2:11:53] susicue: hi hazel and folks!
[2:11:53] Zuldak: Planning to go to silverpine?
[2:12:33] Eirchi: I have two Thori'dals on my mage so I can dual wield
[2:12:40] CurrentsWoW: what does the SF in HCSF stand for?
[2:12:54] NickSarien: self found
[2:13:16] CurrentsWoW: oh that's really cool
[2:13:28] jeffdmk: it should have been ssf
[2:13:45] CurrentsWoW: games finally officially embracing challenge runs
[2:13:45] cashthb: i want a gun mage spec
[2:14:18] CurrentsWoW: KSH HC has been done
[2:14:23] jeffdmk: retail does not even have hardcore
[2:14:56] CurrentsWoW: well yeah just someone doing it without dying
[2:14:59] Eirchi: Hazel, can you go into one of those dangerous zones and do some multi-pulls?
[2:15:05] swooshgt: what realm you playing on ?
[2:15:13] Zuldak: How often do you use a wisk in cookong?
[2:15:51] AlleviateWoW: @jeffdmk bc no one cares about hardcore. its a waste of time.
[2:15:57] apheelia96: @swooshgt skullrock i think
[2:16:14] jeffdmk: @AlleviateWoW do you have data?
[2:16:17] Eirchi: Classic Munter build
[2:16:33] cashthb: I don't think retail challange runs would work out in the long run; like when poe introduced ruthless (that's way mor fun than normal - just sayin) looser casuals were whinig about how it "divides the player base"
[2:17:00] CurrentsWoW: like a fated season type situation
[2:17:06] Elrathir: Hazel you should go into the plaguelands :) no plague there actually! :) should be named the nice-helpful-friend-lands :)
[2:17:13] cashthb: thinking about it, they also whined about shuffle and now that's the defacto ranked pvp mode
[2:17:29] jamien_10: Your current playthrough inspired me to give hc another try, but I'm also leveling the same character on retail to compare and the difference is kinda crazy
[2:17:38] Zuldak: I am super excited for the fated season mount and going to be mad if it's not a duck
[2:18:12] cashthb: btw no aa timer?
[2:18:12] Elrathir: do you have a troll hunter on retail?
[2:18:12] Zuldak: Like imagine if the fated season mount was another armordon
[2:18:22] GreenArrowed: omg a duck
[2:18:33] Eirchi: Hazel, do you have that Ottuk mount that you need to get 3 dungeon rings for?
[2:19:06] cashthb: isn't one of the rings from raid?
[2:19:22] apheelia96: god yes walking sucks
[2:19:50] Eirchi: Hazel, did you eat Otter Pops during your Rural Canadian Upbringing?
[2:20:15] jeffdmk: arrgh just got a triple battler shop on turn 1 in hearthstone
[2:20:17] Eirchi: oh, I forgot Canada has weird brands for everything
[2:20:25] cashthb: could you crank up the settings to take a look at how the fields look on high?
[2:20:30] Elrathir: what's an otter pop?
[2:20:53] ProPaineTheThird: a popsicle
[2:20:55] Elrathir: I would have guessed the father of a wholesome otter family
[2:20:55] ProPaineTheThird: essentially
[2:20:57] GreenArrowed: it's a popsicle in a tube instead  of on a stick
[2:21:01] MichaTx: well depends where you are lol...don't know otter pop hahaha
[2:21:02] starbuckviper: freezepop maybe?
[2:21:15] MichaTx: I know of a freezie
[2:21:21] GreenArrowed: they're almost carbonated
[2:21:27] MichaTx: otter pop sounds like a freezie
[2:21:28] kynlaeh: in the US where I am we would just call them a push pop or a push popsicle
[2:21:49] russtrotter: the best thing was that few minutes after opening when you could slurp melted stuff around portions of the still frozen part... yum
[2:21:51] Eirchi: Otter Pops are the gateway drug to Wine Slushies
[2:21:51] GreenArrowed: a push pop is something else to me
[2:21:52] Chad11: push pop is different than an otter pop
[2:22:14] GreenArrowed: they're ina. tube and you push them up. i remember those orange dream flintstones ones. so good.
[2:22:22] WorldMinusOne: my cousins in alberta called those freeze pops
[2:22:37] Eirchi: Push pop is like an ice cream cone in a tube
[2:22:45] Zuldak: Saw dune yesterday.  It has some big changes from the book but it was very good
[2:22:51] Elrathir: I'm learning a lot about various pop lore
[2:23:04] GreenArrowed: drumsticks
[2:23:11] Aseopp: @Elrathir going to dune tonight in imax
[2:23:15] MichaTx: I call them freezies (I'm in Alberta too). Otter pop is a brand. My texan hubby just said they have Otter pops in Texas lol
[2:23:25] PyahPyahPyahSoda: I buy drumsticks with my adult money :)
[2:23:36] GreenArrowed: i liked rocket pops best
[2:23:45] Eirchi: Dr. Umsticks
[2:24:10] apheelia96: I should have made a druid then I would be the pet
[2:24:25] Eirchi: What are your profs?
[2:24:29] russtrotter: i live near a factory that produces "joy" ice cream cones... holy smokes.. wanna talk about the best smelling factory ever
[2:24:45] Aseopp: @Elrathir sorry that was for zuldak
[2:25:05] MichaTx: @russtrotter I bet :)
[2:25:18] Elrathir: @Aseopp Yeah I figured, all good :D
[2:25:24] Eirchi: We took a vacation to Hershey Penn. when I was a kid, it was a weird town
[2:25:54] GreenArrowed: yes
[2:26:08] GreenArrowed: it's a company town
[2:26:09] apheelia96: you gotta go to hershy park then
[2:26:37] vampire_enthusiast: I grew up like 45 minutes from Hershey, I can vouch that it is certainly a weird town
[2:27:00] MichaTx: kinda like a hobbit :P lol
[2:27:16] Eirchi: The buildings are made of chocolate
[2:27:19] MichaTx: lol right?
[2:27:24] apheelia96: I was born in Lancaster PA (the city)
[2:28:40] Eirchi: I watched the 2nd Aquaman movie last night... time to pull the plug on superhero movies
[2:28:58] GreenArrowed: i didn't realize the 2nd one was out
[2:29:17] apheelia96: Do not want to see Aquaman. Im over super hero movies now
[2:29:38] cashthb: yeah, movie marketing is weird noawadays
[2:30:15] Elrathir: I wanna see Dune part the second
[2:31:03] Eirchi: what's the spell when your gal throws both hands up in the air at the start of combat?
[2:31:15] Aseopp: @Elrathir <3
[2:31:30] Eirchi: I never knew that had an animation
[2:31:42] apheelia96: OOh I just saw the first Dune! Ima wait for the second one to be streamable or rentable at home though
[2:31:54] Elrathir: uh oh
[2:32:01] cashthb: I think most super hero movies being pretty shitty also plays a part, if they were to release Nolans Batman quality movies I'd have zero issues
[2:32:04] Eirchi: I make that same gesture when I'm exasperated while driving

[2:38:43] CurrentsWoW: loaded
[2:38:45] jeffdmk: @rtsplanner there was tons to collect in shadowlands most of the negativity about wow seems to come from people parroting the opinions of world first players that dont apply to them
