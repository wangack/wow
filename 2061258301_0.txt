[2:36:22] JasonMunday: try hitting the space bar Hmm
[2:36:23] weeshue: both mouse buttons and space bar at the same time so you jump before running off
[2:36:23] dipchit1: just practice on the ground, try doing a full momentum jump without your character walking forward first. Get the timing down

[3:08:48] creamqlo: not until you pointed it out LUL
[3:09:01] upsidedownreprogram: @creamqlo lmao
[3:09:02] remusREMUS: deadly brew should use the highest instant poison u got unlocked
[3:09:03] jkdstealth1: of course
[3:09:15] remusREMUS: ofc i got ads i cant hear her talk about it lol
[3:09:19] coleyroll: yo this is the jammmmm
[3:09:25] pakaganda2125: you don't want poisons on if you have deadly brew
[3:09:45] jkdstealth1: it wasnt me

[3:10:02] WrekkCity: Madge
[3:10:03] TripWrldd: thats a bad person
[3:10:05] Ekimzenitram: Don't listen to them
[3:10:07] iBanEvader: @PalmBee you should put poisons on your weapons even with deadly brew
[3:10:07] TripWrldd: can just be nice about it
[3:10:12] iBanEvader: unless you have a feral druid
[3:10:17] TripWrldd: it all depends
[3:10:21] TripWrldd: it depends
[3:10:24] TripWrldd: on what youre doing
[3:10:25] iBanEvader: ^
[3:10:25] jkdstealth1: of course
[3:10:31] jimbology: envenom makes your instant poison proc more
[3:10:36] jkdstealth1: appl epie
[3:10:36] iBanEvader: @PalmBee ferald druid -> only put poison on offhand
[3:10:45] iBanEvader: @PalmBee no feral druid -> poison on both
[3:10:55] Xzenith15: you always want offhand poison, it's jut mh if feral
[3:11:09] Ekimzenitram: It says it has the same chance as if you have a poison on
[3:11:16] Zaeboz_: BFD ones wont work in Gnomer
[3:11:17] iBanEvader: yea sharpening stone is better
[3:11:17] remusREMUS: i dont think u need poison with deadly brew?
[3:11:17] TripWrldd: yea for bfd
[3:11:21] TripWrldd: those only work in bfd

[3:11:49] pakaganda2125: xp
[3:11:50] iBanEvader: it's decent xp
[3:11:52] peteschaff: xp is good up until 40
[3:11:54] Ekimzenitram: exp and the trinket
[3:11:56] TripWrldd: xp
[3:12:04] traylz91: pretty good exp
[3:12:04] remusREMUS: deadly brew uses highest level poison i think so applying poison is redundant right? can somebody correct me if thats wrong
[3:12:12] Terp: couple caster items and trinket still good
[3:12:12] Firelord_Trolldemort: how goes it
[3:12:26] ruthlesskendogg: the bossess in bfd give 5kxp each
[3:12:33] TripWrldd: palmbee youre right,
[3:12:40] jkdstealth1: chat dont argue
[3:12:52] TripWrldd: correct
[3:12:59] remusREMUS: i think the chance is the same as the instant poison chance. i know for a fact in phase 1 deadly brew was the same as having poison applied to both weapons
[3:13:07] lowsunshade: dont forget the antidote
[3:13:09] angryant35: Oh my god, you look amazing tonight!!!
[3:13:10] Xzenith15: you're right but weapon poisons are only a chance to proc too
[3:13:12] Gokublue001: lol
[3:13:13] WrekkCity: spicy
[3:13:20] narcissistictraits: lolol
[3:13:27] Ekimzenitram: @remusREMUS yes that is what the tool tip says
[3:13:27] Xzenith15: it just doubles your chance which is good with poison build which is current meta
[3:13:29] jkdstealth1: chat if shes pretty sure , dont argue with her
[3:13:41] spuhcific: if someone calls you an idiot just say "no u"
[3:13:43] iBanEvader: @remusREMUS extra poison chance gets transformed into deadly poison instead of instant poison
[3:13:45] remusREMUS: @Xzenith15 are u sure about this
[3:13:46] Ekimzenitram: the tool tip says its the same chance with or without poisons
[3:13:50] iBanEvader: @remusREMUS palmbee is right and you are wrong
[3:13:53] stork_leg: and dragon chili
[3:13:58] Xzenith15: yes
[3:14:01] remusREMUS: ok
[3:14:28] TripWrldd: offhand yes
[3:14:30] seryl_: just play unarmed
[3:14:31] TripWrldd: depends on build
[3:14:33] TripWrldd: tbh
[3:14:44] Ekimzenitram: just read it, it says it has the same chance
[3:14:46] TripWrldd: just use youre critical thinking when changing build around to see what works, i trust you
[3:15:07] TripWrldd: other people who are jerks
[3:15:14] jimbology: it would be a decision vs sharpening stone
[3:15:14] Captain_N_The_GameMaster: djtobi1Wi djtobi1Da djtobi1Fe
[3:15:15] iBanEvader: it hurts if you have a feral druid in your group
[3:15:20] iBanEvader: wild strikes buff is better
[3:15:20] Ekimzenitram: you would do more dps with sharpening stones
[3:15:23] remusREMUS: i was under impression deadly brew was teh same as having poison and the application of poison did nothin
[3:15:23] jkdstealth1: great logic i agree
[3:15:26] iBanEvader: or a shaman totem
[3:15:34] Terp: mostly caster gear got changed
[3:16:05] Ekimzenitram: LMAO

[5:04:23] ThrowingShaed: i mean hockey has a cap too. a lot of sports have salary caps
[5:04:32] Gokublue001: not everything is fair in sports depending team's location but poor franchise wins in every sports

[5:05:38] ThrowingShaed: Happens in every sport, happens outside of sport too.
[5:05:39] DanielSauces: dark times
[5:05:43] JTPlayaMade08: only sport that is not rigged is professional wrestling
[5:05:46] biffedit2x: Football players flop just as hard as basketball players now. it's sad. Rugby can't fake that
