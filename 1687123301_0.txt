[6:46:06] EvoCyberNation: I'm not sure?  O_O
[6:46:37] EvoCyberNation: Protection paladins do, but you have to ramp up the holy to get their defensives up. I think pallys should start off with 5 holy points.

[6:53:26] EvoCyberNation: Oh yeah, the warlocks. they don't die unless you have massive damage
[6:53:29] insectplato: lock chasing pala tank

[6:57:25] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[6:57:37] justjoshingyo: they nerf tanks for "surviving" too much. and "matching" dps. but yet they dont nerf locks healing/dmg/dots and keep buffing them...
[6:57:42] justjoshingyo: WHERES THE BALANCE IN THAT?
[6:58:19] BoricuaSJ: funny how they nerf tanks... but make a DPS class more tanky than a tank, that can heal more than healers
[6:58:24] xxshaze: @justjoshingyo brooo frrrrr
[6:58:45] thedonmac: Seen many shadows?
[6:58:55] BoricuaSJ: developers play warlocks in pvp that is why
