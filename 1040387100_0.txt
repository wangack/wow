[0:43:20] Moobot: @The_Red__Queen Find out more about the Great Push including tournament format in the viewer's guide: http://blizz.ly/TGPViewersGuide
[0:43:22] Daltran83: exploit bug :) Blizzard must sanction this
[0:43:22] Kahlandra: !rules
[0:43:22] Moobot: @Kahlandra The full ruleset can be found on GameBattles: https://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/world-of-warcraft/tournament/mdi-the-great-push/rules
[0:43:26] rjhenator: guarantee the other teams already know about this
[0:43:27] Ehnaton1: @Sathyron is it though ?
[0:43:28] Tickwick: double spec is forbidden for mdi not tgp
[0:43:30] NETRAV3R: They play 2 tanks?? loool
[0:43:31] Aneas: no way to pick it up in time for this tourny @Warcraft
[0:43:38] FENIXHAZE10: actually i think they are going for 2 chest with this and other strat at 27
[0:43:38] Kelthiz: Easy to execute, but who has created a hunter on TR I wonder.
[0:43:51] sniffsc: Its not hard but time is probably too short
[0:43:56] qtsage: dam, this key wide open then lol
[0:43:57] Kahlandra: they can't have two of the same tank, they can have two different tanks
[0:44:02] ayohae: no, this FAR less technical. you don't really have to do anything you haven't already done
[0:44:02] mikkeal0: @emnitthy no it isnt. Lots of enemies in game aggro to everyone if its aggro'd. It aggros, hunter feigns, and it goes after the rest of the group
[0:44:03] denn1is: Frag is really good on hunter tho
[0:44:04] Fleymour: why we see 3x HoA and 1x PF ?
[0:44:16] RafaSchmitt96: the lack of warriors disturbs me
[0:44:17] ArtesiaWoW: Team compositions can feature any number of Tanks, Healers, and DPS roles totaling 5 players.
[0:44:22] Ukillay: Where is Xyronic SwiftRage
[0:44:26] bannad: he could have Survival! such a waste of a meme
[0:44:27] KewTroll: They are not allowed to stack specs, but they can have any composition of roles
[0:44:29] Grortraugh: OHNO
[0:44:42] Solax10: @ethereal_strider warriors aren't good
[0:44:48] voidlock42: Normal 2 tank strategy
[0:44:52] qtsage: @DraevynLeon from across the map?
[0:44:58] 11000BG: but other teams can +2 with normal start
[0:45:00] spectrashock: whos ready for the infinite drama surrounding this strat PopCorn
[0:45:00] emnitthy: @mikkkeal it’s delusional to think that this is an intended way to do stuff and isn’t an exploit, mobs literally teleporting across the dungeon
[0:45:02] Kelthiz: @Fleymour Because if it's a tie they need a +27 to fight Echo
[0:45:03] brianlawl: pass on fire, arcane for lyfe
[0:45:12] ClNNAMONBUN: how sheeesh doing
[0:45:13] SindelPt: double spec in not allowed; double roles are allowed
[0:45:14] vision2111: 28? you are cooked
[0:45:16] aleqjensen: 28 lol no way
[0:45:17] Leadmin: !standing
[0:45:19] uwumage: !bracket
[0:45:19] Moobot: @uwumage Follow the standings along with Raider.IO: http://rio.gg/greatpushleaderblz
[0:45:22] ariastrasza: Play this normally She says,  Lol I don't even know what is normal anymore
[0:45:22] Fleymour: @Kelthiz ty.
[0:45:23] TomTheDruid: why stop at 28?
[0:45:25] Pannekaker: @emnitthy That's how snapping and global combat works, bud
[0:45:29] pryce_x: snapping mobs isn't a new concept though
[0:45:38] Sjeletyven1: with borers 28 is doable. naguura smart :)
[0:45:38] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel “AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik “DoA” Lonnquist, Tristan “Dratnos” Killeen, Caroline “Naguura” Forer, Joseph “Psy” Prendergast, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton, and Alex “Xyronic” Tatge
[0:45:38] Norgrim: no way this is not getting nerfed
[0:45:39] Axcelll: they'll do a 30 with this strat
[0:45:39] Delacroixzz: ambition and skyline got the secret tech btw guys KEKW
[0:45:46] spectrashock: snapping mobs was used by every single team in the qualifiers in necrotic wake
[0:45:46] zeushatesem: @Fleymour they are trying to catch up to the highest keys, highest being echos 27 hoa
[0:45:48] FENIXHAZE10: na snaping at stradama is imposible
[0:45:49] TomTheDruid: it would be 1 rain on 4 players, 2 of who are tanks
[0:45:53] Athinira: emnitthy It's a thin line between exploit and smart use of game mechanics
[0:45:57] qtsage: @DraevynLeon you need to be in range of the thing you want to MD to though. They explained its because of global combat
[0:45:57] Moobot: Find the affixes for the Great Push here: http://blizz.ly/TGPMapAffix
[0:46:01] mikkeal0: @emnitthy Mobs teleportig in dungeons is not new. It doesnt need to be intended, most run strategies arnt the normal intended way. Its innovating a wacky strategy, nothing wrong with it
[0:46:02] chip9800: is YEP Fallin behind ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ?
[0:46:07] SerMitten: Snapping was a big part of doing bfa dungeons in mdi, nothing wrong with this strat, intended or not
[0:46:24] Tickwick: @emnitthy snapping is an intended mechanic to prevent exploiting by kiting in unreachable places
[0:46:28] LaddergoatFIN: snapping has been used in mdi so much that there is no way this will be considered an exploit. bear team even snapped amarth in qualifiers
[0:46:31] seteleechete: Can they +3 this?
[0:46:35] ayohae: the strat is fine, it'll just be fixed after the tournament
[0:46:36] retro_jim_: whos winning?
[0:46:36] Chihib: They made it to +30 once alrdy
[0:46:37] Szyko_dk: @chip9800 they quit
[0:46:44] sniffsc: Its not intended but its fine right now
[0:46:45] fidoTimMaia: NA MALDING
[0:46:46] kwizzzz: considering how fast blizzard fixed the mc/cyclone thing i feel like it is very brave to do this hunter tactic in an actual tournament
[0:46:55] Athinira: seteleechete Nah, it won't be +3.
[0:47:01] qtsage: @DraevynLeon well then study it harder lol bc you're missing something
[0:47:01] sniffsc: YEP tilt
[0:47:06] ayohae: this is easy for these teams to pick up
[0:47:06] Ferality_: clobal combat removal hotfix inc KEKW
[0:47:09] emnitthy: I guess if blizzard doesn’t care then they accept it
[0:47:11] Ehnaton1: YEP turned into NOPE LUL
[0:47:16] AuroryClaire: I mean, if blizzard hotfix this during the tournament, and echo dont have another strategy anyway to win with, they still basically win
[0:47:24] TheSinChao: @fidoTimMaia Why would NA mald when EU already has quitters LUL
[0:47:25] beachboy23: I dont think this is something they shud be doing on an turnament
[0:47:33] FENIXHAZE10: im actually thinking +2 is not doable for them now
[0:47:37] sniffsc: @AuroryClaire They wont hotfix it
[0:47:38] 11000BG: blizzard cant fix this for tournament. they need to change their game code or disable pf
[0:47:46] Relliker4960: why have all the dh tanks turned to druids?
[0:47:46] Pannekaker: @beachboy23 Why not?
[0:47:49] SoloRankedPlayerr: @ayohae it looks easy, there are many small details that are important for this start to go right
[0:47:56] AuroryClaire: @beachboy23 every team was snapping a mob during qualifiers in necrotic wake
[0:47:58] Tickwick: there is nothing to fix
[0:48:01] boryslav91: echo still doing expolid?
[0:48:02] pryce_x: why shouldnt they use this strat if it gives them an advantage and its perfectly legal?
[0:48:03] Eoth__: how do they get the plague borrers past the second boss?
[0:48:05] Krysch: why shouldnt they doing it? plaguefall is broken and the by far the worst dungeon in sl, so they will probably make it better afterwards
[0:48:11] FENIXHAZE10: they can fix it on live like they do in world first races
[0:48:11] Robertovic112: is it time based or who pushes the highest??
[0:48:11] xxAeryn: because druid is a lot more tanky especially against physical
[0:48:17] TheHumanTsunami: !spec
[0:48:21] SoloRankedPlayerr: @virloo its not exploit
[0:48:29] Pannekaker: Remember guys, I know this is hard to grasp, unintended =/= exploit
[0:48:29] KewTroll: @Eoth__ They didn't kill the mini boss
[0:48:32] xxAeryn: @Robertovic112 highest total key level
[0:48:33] Rndm3011: wildigW look at me too
[0:48:33] bannad: "weird stuff" again. drink
[0:48:35] ayohae: @SoloRankedPlayerr the teams now have perfect information, the only new thing was the hunter piece, everything else is the same
[0:48:36] Bitmap42: Did YEP drop out?
[0:48:38] MightyGIGACHAD: Echo way too 5Head
[0:48:41] ConcernedGaming: did Yep Forfeit?
[0:48:43] Vhye76: Imagine thinking that teams will abuse bad dungeon mechanics.  We didn't see anything at all like this in, say, Tol Dagor.
[0:48:44] Theriums: Ambition are having a much better run than Sheesh
[0:48:47] Eoth__: @KewTroll so they just keep spawning?
[0:48:48] renato_aka_fussing: echo with 2 tank ?
[0:48:48] Asteriix1: strat randomly stopped working LUL
[0:48:49] chip9800: @Szyko_dk thats dissapointing

[0:48:51] Sumirina: @Bitmap42 yes
[0:48:52] Red_Queen____: @ConcernedGaming yes
[0:48:56] sniffsc: YEP dropped out
[0:48:57] crouch6995: I just jumped into it. How did frag misdirect the plague guys to the tanks?
[0:49:03] SoloRankedPlayerr: @ayohae you will see that nobody will use this start besides them
[0:49:04] KurdtC: They are 4 teams playing with the same comp? Or its a few cams for one team?
[0:49:07] Krysch: the could to a +3 in pf
[0:49:16] Tickwick: ataldazar was snapping fiesta in mdi and nothing changed about it
[0:49:20] ayohae: @SoloRankedPlayerr you're way misinformed then sorry
[0:49:23] bannad: YEP Noped
[0:49:24] chip9800: is this EU VS NA?
[0:49:29] FENIXHAZE10: +3 is already gone
[0:49:30] Kuroz: wildigG wildigHug
[0:49:31] Thatsafy: @crouch6995 global combat snaps them to the rest of group when he feign deaths
[0:49:33] xpredatorx_x: what are they doign with echo?
[0:49:34] kahn09: bear squad big boss
[0:49:37] ConcernedGaming: @crouch6995 Its triggering GLobal Combat, so he pulls them, feigns, and they snap
[0:49:39] LaddergoatFIN: @crouch6995 seems like borers are global combat so no need for misdirect
[0:49:41] tondk123: ambition looks good
[0:49:41] Kuroz: wildigG @bannad
[0:49:42] Pannekaker: @KurdtC The team names are right above the party frames
[0:49:43] Hordiix: OFF GOES FRAG

[0:58:05] marceeeel: @DemonolGaming they cant win so they dont bother playing
[0:58:05] Niixxxa: The mage is accaount GingiTV
[0:58:06] WaxBalloon: yep withdrew, not sure why
[0:58:08] AuroryClaire: @ayohae its okay, you can @ me when someone does that 28 without using this echo strategy :)
[0:58:08] azarn01: they did it in 24 not sure they will make it again in 25 or 24, but the strat is amazing
[0:58:15] atpx486: RETAIL OMEGALUL
[0:58:19] emnitthy: Can we go back to 4 teams and not just focus on echo?
[0:58:22] Fleymour: blizzard just hire echo for testing ur game LUL
[0:58:23] Flying5hitz: plagueborers probably snap to the closest players to the original spot, that's why they are fighting domina up there (pure speculation xD) @Warcraft
[0:58:27] Assirra: where are they getting the plaugeborers from? the whole team was in the boss room
[0:58:28] Sefty123: @azarn01 its better in higher keys
[0:58:29] lucidream93: Ambition dont know the strat
[0:58:31] DemonolGaming: @marceeeel did they legit just stop playing?!
[0:58:35] BlasterMasta: is that a hunter!?!
[0:58:35] ayohae: @AuroryClaire gl on your ksm push :)
[0:58:37] xblackmothx: @MrKreepz She's a commentator, what do you expect them to do?
[0:58:39] aleemaann: @emnitthy so boring
[0:58:40] doubleshinetv: Can't wait for my level 53 tanks to try this in leveling normals
[0:58:44] Beastrace: frag is just hanging out
[0:58:47] muyuu: @Assirra hunter isnt there :)
[0:58:47] Tarinoitsija: modern commentary means you have to talk about something without pause
[0:58:50] altieri43: I miss meeres
[0:58:51] AuroryClaire: @ayohae again, you still havent told me your ksm team :(
[0:58:51] highvoltage988: @Assirra not Frag, he's basically AFK at the miniboss
[0:58:53] defconfg: is this echo stream?
[0:58:56] mikkeal0: @emnitthy why are you so salty about it. Its something completely new nad interesting, everyone wants it focused on
[0:58:57] badassito_gg: HUNTERS STONK!
[0:58:57] azarn01: sefty123 oh ? well i'm lwaiting for it :)
[0:59:00] Krysch: dh is necrolord btw

[0:59:04] ribosomes322: what's the dungeon it looks like no one has done?
[0:59:04] mokniah: this doesn't seem that great of a strat
[0:59:11] azarn01: ggezcya y
[0:59:12] grimelocked: Echo adds another task to blizzard for 9.1 Patch LUL
[0:59:12] kycttv: Can we see 4 screen
[0:59:17] Fleymour: BM hunter 2.0
[0:59:17] shieldz__: Gamers are awesome. I love this
[0:59:20] vaereee: @emnitthy u just love eu
[0:59:22] Sumirina: plaguefall was bound to  get technical but it still feels ridiculous
[0:59:22] MrKreepz: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:59:25] Dwn003: Imagine patching an exploit just for them to find a new 1 🤣🤣
[0:59:28] BlinkHeals: @mokniah why not its working very well
[0:59:29] azarn01: @ggezcya gingy is
[0:59:29] kycttv: I wanna see if any other teams time the 27 zzz
[0:59:33] ariastrasza: Patch 9.2 Hunters can now summon plagueboarers
[0:59:36] Darkgift: so we sick of echo ..other teams pls
[0:59:39] Szyko_dk: @kycttv nope
[0:59:43] 11000BG: this is a fun strat, but they gonna +2 like the other team
[0:59:48] tipikus: i bet they had this strat before the other one
[0:59:50] Finkold: @mokniahthe thing is that it is better in higher keys, so same pace in higher so yes it is a good strat
[0:59:51] WorgenDeath: @mokniah The damage scales with keylevel and it is the only way to kill the high level tyranical bosses
[0:59:52] Insidieux: i thought more than 1 team was competing in this tourny :)
[0:59:53] すみれい: why are they using 2 tanks?
[0:59:53] Crow7500: creative use of game mechanics dratnoSmile
[0:59:54] blastboys123: what is the hunter doing?
[0:59:56] Norgrim: never heard "a real interesting strategy" is a synonym of "exploit"
[1:00:05] blastboys123: What the heck ?
[1:00:09] Lilynia: I saw Zaelia PoV and almost had a heart attack, then understood that it's warcraft' channel :'( :'(
[1:00:11] Niixxxa: They had the strat before
[1:00:16] crispysnowball: @Insidieux Which team isnt playing?
[1:00:17] Tanidge: lol
[1:00:22] gurningfo: the thing you don't understand is it's maybe slower on 24 but it's gonna be the same pace on higher key
[1:00:22] DanceWithMeQt: thats genius
[1:00:23] Ikkinzan: Snapping is not an exploit
[1:00:24] avandia: after this blizzard would probably just make plagueborers do zero damage to mobs
[1:00:25] ariastrasza: Does Plagueboarer Stream?
[1:00:27] blastboys123: "technique" yeah
[1:00:27] Ferality_: snapping already existed in classic tho
[1:00:27] Dwn003: I guess you just don’t know the definition of exploit.
[1:00:28] AuntyShake37: giga andromeda brains
[1:00:29] martzerarh: get rid of snapping. such rubbish
[1:00:30] Psybear_tv: Ambition about to get that 27 HoA :O
[1:00:33] MrKreepz: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:00:37] Dhaarling: octaviPepe sending another borer
[1:00:41] RisingCosmos: @Norgrim Blizzard is pretty hands off in M+ when it comes to exploits
[1:00:41] Moobot: Find more from team Sheeesh here: http://blizz.ly/TeamSheeesh
[1:00:44] mikkeal0: @ariastraza plagueborers new tame
[1:00:48] blastboys123: It is a clever use of game mechanics but this is 100% going to get nerfed and changed
[1:00:48] klappe92: Clever use of game mechanics LUL
[1:00:51] defconfg: LFG Ambition
[1:00:56] Ascot_NI: does the plagueborer stream?
[1:00:58] Tickwick: need to build additional borers
[1:00:58] WaxBalloon: you just need to make it so that plagueborers don't automatically get aggro on the whole group
[1:01:01] aleemaann: Focus 4mbition
[1:01:09] straighttokes420: PogChamp
[1:01:13] Jouricarver: I think it's fun and would like  to see more tbh
[1:01:13] Moobot: Follow the leaderboard along with Raider.IO: http://rio.gg/greatpushleaderblz
[1:01:16] qtsage: calling this an exploit might be the smoothest-brain take ive ever read
[1:01:16] Kliz: infinite time
[1:01:22] muyuu: Sheesh LUL
[1:01:26] mikkeal0: @BoostBuddiesOfficial you're just wrong
[1:01:27] Tengrinletos: Well Guilds got banned for using strats like that ....
[1:01:29] IceQ1337: @bibel_selger not allowed to leave dungeon mid key
[1:01:29] aloeveraqueen: can't they just use one borer? they've two-chested +30 PF with mc and cyclone
[1:01:32] Rhizenn: Billy PoV Pog
[1:01:38] Verruzan: if snapping wouldnt exist, ppl could just exploit mobs and safesoot them. snapping is a way to PREVENT exploiting.
[1:01:43] ayohae: @qtsage this chat is full of bad takes
[1:01:47] Tickwick: snapping is intended mechanic lol, naguura literally explained it 2min ago
[1:01:48] Niixxxa: Can't they mute the sounds of the dungeons...man
[1:01:53] Asteriix1: echoes timer isnt that great tbh
[1:01:54] Beastrace: naguura knows about statues
[1:01:54] WaxBalloon: mc cyclone is fixed
[1:01:54] MysticKim: this strategy looks horrible
[1:01:59] ariastrasza: Cyclone Plagueboarer has been fixed
[1:01:59] windypa: didn't echo +2 a 30 plaguefall, and now this strat make them slower ?
[1:02:02] FreezedDiamond: Sheeeeeeeeesh
[1:02:14] azarn01: +2 a key allow more point ? or just finishing the key is enough ?
[1:02:15] syrikk: chamberlain takes at least 4 minutes 30 so
[1:02:16] Tarinoitsija: will it cost blizzard 100 million to merge realms so that they are active and worth playing in?
[1:02:17] LaddergoatFIN: where do the people calling snapping exploiting every tournament come from? it has been allowed since the start of mdi
[1:02:17] qtsage: @ayohae yeah, sub-60 IQ average for sure
[1:02:20] Vexed_Turtle: Did Tettles get banned for swearing?
[1:02:20] emnitthy: yeah im sure teleporting mobs across dungeons is part of blizzards development process for how to clear them
[1:02:23] SaiNs_: @windypa that strat has been fixed
[1:02:26] Hinzir: this strategy may look horrible but it will work on any level
[1:02:26] syrikk: it'll be close
[1:02:27] Jouricarver: the old strat got patched
[1:02:29] doubleshinetv: +30 strat was hotfixed right away lol
[1:02:29] blastboys123: the real question is wether or not blizzard intended for plauge borers to teleport and clear mobs for you
[1:02:30] dwunk: lol asmongold waiting room
[1:02:30] Jjmn12: wait the plagueborer ticks while she's down LUL
[1:02:35] Sumirina: @windypa  the way they did that was fixed
[1:02:37] zeushatesem: @windypa this isnt their real strat
[1:02:42] mustbeTrypsin: @windypa that was on fortified where plagueborer damage scales faster than boss hp
[1:02:44] Theriums: So far Ambition's 24 plaguefall has been much faster than this strat
[1:02:44] blastboys123: i dont think so tho
[1:02:52] WaxBalloon: yeah I wish they would mute in game sound
[1:02:54] rofliexd: @windypa they used different strat (cyclone so mob doesnt die), it got hotfixed before tournament
[1:03:00] straighttokes420: ambition Pog
[1:03:09] hellsdrains: @windypa Clever use of mechanics that was hotfixed was how the 30 happened
[1:03:15] KewTroll: @theriums But this strat scales in damage dealt with Plagueborers. Meaning it can go much higher
[1:03:20] SaiNs_: @theriums but the dmg of plagueborers scales, so the time will be +- the same on higher keys
[1:03:21] Adr3naliine: Ambition will fails
[1:03:25] Hinzir: theriums , this gimmick tactic will work any level ,since there is no dps requirement, borers kill bosses
[1:03:27] emnitthy: That 30 doesn’t count in my book
[1:03:33] defconfg: Ambition clutch or fail
[1:03:35] brian99000: they already timed it @Adr3NaLiiNe
[1:03:36] Vertzlol: Omg its so close
[1:03:41] grimelocked: Frag right for the next 5 hours -> ResidentSleeper
[1:03:49] 11000BG: ambition 1 min for 10%
[1:03:49] madhatterui: i love this, seeing something new and creative is great
[1:03:49] md8281: omg ambition
[1:03:50] syrikk: @theriums, @theriums true, but I imagine the strat by echo might make higher keys more doable. I dunno. its super strange to me lol
[1:03:53] Larocca_88: not even +2
[1:03:54] kycttv: Let’s go ambition
[1:03:57] defconfg: not a 27
[1:03:58] cpmd4: Ambition timer
[1:03:58] TheCloudkill: they dont +2 it they havent killed second boss btw
[1:03:58] Sumirina: i think zaelia mostly gets aggro on the borers
[1:04:02] Adr3naliine: @BrianTheProg Yep,  joke ^^
[1:04:02] koaaLa16: @Adr3NaLiiNe already timed lol
[1:04:04] Sefail: is ambition even gonna time it?
[1:04:10] Kobaaya: cheesing dung and fail 2 chest :S
[1:04:11] Fleymour: @Warcraft its an fortified tactic .. thats why slow
[1:04:12] kamisato47: 200 iq not even +2
[1:04:15] Sefail: they had 5 min before pulling boss
[1:04:16] kraiser1624: @casters will it count dungeon complete with one boss alive? they skipped 2nd boss
[1:04:16] Papryk_: dk on necrotic?
[1:04:18] ConcernedGaming: a blood DK is going to die too much
[1:04:25] Vdarkblade: Ambition?
[1:04:29] Gunman1g: but blood dk wont be able to run away every time
[1:04:29] syrikk: i knew they weren't that close

[1:06:18] Felskeren: @bannad yes
[1:06:18] Moobot: Broadcast starts Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 10am Pacific / 7pm CEST. Players have 5 hours each day to push the dungeons.
[1:06:20] yogibearz: @bannad  she did
[1:06:22] WaxBalloon: echo needed practice on the strat, that's why they used it on the 24
[1:06:25] Chr0nicConsumer: report fraggie for low dps Kappa
[1:06:26] vision2111: their 24 is really slow though
[1:06:27] shieldz__: welcome back frag ResidentSleeper
[1:06:27] ShenLongGame: HOPEFULLY they get banned
[1:06:29] ToppTheDwarf: @seiffre it's WF for world first

[1:06:44] Lotor1991: Echo should get disqualification because of using bugs/exploits
[1:06:46] Vexed_Turtle: Did YEP team quit?
[1:06:48] mikkeal0: @bibel_selger sadge
[1:06:52] pryce_x: strat will be more viable with higher key lvl bc of scaling i guess
[1:06:53] glooyy: can someone explain please how ambition is far ahead?
[1:06:57] ShenLongGame: Exopliting bugs isn't really playing the game

[1:07:16] Assirra: @glooyy only ones so far that completed a PF
[1:07:18] Fjellryn: Skyline 1min10 slower than Ambition after Echelon
[1:07:19] blastboys123: its not a bug its a game mechanic
[1:07:20] Felskeren: @glooyy they actually finished plaguefall unlike all others
[1:07:20] derTikimann: @ShenLongGame its not a bug tho.
[1:07:20] convexsmudge: @glooyy they already have a PF key done
[1:07:21] md8281: ambition has 2 chested plaguefall this gives them huge advantage
[1:07:23] jerrydacarry: @ShenLongGame who asked?
[1:07:23] cpmd4: nobody else has completed a PF yet so Ambition is the only one with points for that dungeon
[1:07:24] BlinkHeals: @ShenLongGame its not a bug really they put snapping in along time ago

[1:08:51] ballsoutboneyartistic: dropping out is pretty lame
[1:08:53] emnitthy: @longconnsilver probably but we won’t see anything cause production is literally hard focusing on echo
[1:08:53] RisingCosmos: grats, @Merciful !
[1:09:02] yolorob45: first time i have seen druid be op
[1:09:07] grimelocked: Score should be probably like this to avoid misunderstanding -> +24 = 1 point, +25 = 2 points and so on
[1:09:19] Sumirina: @jcanela13 hard to say, it might be more valuable the higher they get, because of scaling
[1:09:21] zeushatesem: echo trolling
[1:09:24] littid: @MrZeev  wait for higher keys ist scales^^
[1:09:25] oQixio: they messed up their strat probably

[1:10:24] Waterrmaloon: Naowh just said they have only used the strat on a +0
[1:10:26] MrKreepz: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:10:27] Lyonidasx: Is the WF marker relevant for the standings?
[1:10:28] naughtdread: its cause
[1:10:32] Kobaaya: they dont cheese they done it live proper way w1:P
[1:10:33] 13_canela: @Sumirina If druid died in PF 24 in domina, what about in 28?
[1:10:33] WaxBalloon: echo baiting other teams into sheet strat Kappa
[1:10:36] shallow60: ambition normal tactic and +2 xd
[1:10:46] 13_canela: 26* sorry
[1:10:48] vision2111: ambition went in their true form with rogue dh let's goo
[1:10:49] yogibearz: @huo_junzhang  they decided now to play today because too behind
[1:10:52] JustLewlies: @Stinpak So they can skip the 25
[1:10:56] Asteriix1: @Stinpak ambition can do +27 with their strat but not 28
[1:10:56] Moobot: Find more from team Sheeesh here: http://blizz.ly/TeamSheeesh
[1:10:59] Assirra: Imagine if the casters talked just a bit more about other groups rather than 90% Echo. It would be so fun

[1:11:02] Dhaarling: imagine not understanding borer key scalling
[1:11:09] Moiny: 3Head chat right here
[1:11:10] KareiTV: ambition strat doesnt scale, plagueborers do
[1:11:16] vision2111: @Asteriix1 they are gonna try 28

[1:11:44] grimelocked: @double_shine ye, but when someone see difference in 25 + point between teams their first though - wow, they are miles ahead of second team when they really not
[1:11:46] shallow60: casters just leeching for echo, i wish i can hear smth about any other team
[1:11:46] doubleshinetv: @Assirra I mean they're doing a super innovative strat
[1:11:52] Nastradin: everything is all about ambition's PF 26
[1:11:52] mutelibmb: problem is tyranical, hp of the boss increases match more than the boar damage increases per +key
[1:11:53] avatarst: how many hours left?
[1:11:55] spectrestare: echos gonna win dont matter
[1:11:57] MrKreepz: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[1:12:05] BlinkHeals: @Assirra yeah talking about litterally the best M+ team is so bad
[1:12:10] substantialphallus: hahahaha
[1:12:15] Sumirina: @jcanela13 it's scary for sure, but there were times, when the adds didn't do anything at all, so I wonder if that was a execution thing / coming too close etc
[1:12:17] doubleshinetv: @grimelocked Yeah i agree the scoreboard is super misleading. Having 78 score is better than 150
[1:12:23] Eraste: ya, F echo
[1:12:25] GLOCKXWORK: All that work just to barely time a 24 PF LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:12:25] betterjunglealwayswins: Bearstream in +27 PogChamp
[1:12:33] tharawow: ??? they did a 30 PF already on tournament realm didnt they?
[1:12:35] trollmengba: Bear :(
[1:12:38] sintax_24: dude Naguura just sweats Echo its all she talks about
[1:12:44] mikotherogue: they're not the best m+ team they're the best mdi team
[1:12:52] Lyonidasx: @Tharantos they can't abuse that tactic anymore
[1:12:52] Lonely_TTV: @Tharantos that git fuxed
[1:12:52] AyareTV: they had 30 +2 in Testing but fortified in PF
[1:12:54] angerfist_1993: they did a 30 PF
[1:12:55] betterjunglealwayswins: @Tharantos its bolstering necrotic though
[1:12:56] Fuwahta: atleast it makes the tourny even more funny to watch
[1:12:59] bosse_brun: @Tharantos Yeah on fortified, with a strat that has been hotfixed
[1:13:00] KareiTV: @Tharantos theat got hotfixed
[1:13:02] 13_canela: @Sumirina well, later we'll see
[1:13:07] ballorica: this is getting boring listening to echo chills all the time
[1:13:09] tharawow: i see
[1:13:09] zeushatesem: NA so mad
[1:13:10] jundarer: the +30 was with a bug that doesn't exist anymore
[1:13:13] BlinkHeals: @emnitthy yeah because they were doing a weird strat on a dungeon that no one has timed besides 1 other team
[1:13:22] tharawow: thanks chat <3
[1:13:30] Sumirina: @jcanela13 yeah, don't know myself
[1:13:45] doubleshinetv: I love how people cry about lack of diversity then cry that the casters are talking about echo running 2 tanks LOL
[1:13:47] cpmd4: sheesh is way ahead of skyline tho
[1:13:55] 13_canela: @Tharantos they did it with a sttrat which consisted of ciclon palgueborers but blizzard fixed that
[1:13:56] 11000BG: sheesh not gonna time it im affraid :(
[1:13:58] gimmimoar: !ambition

[1:14:43] Ignite_CLO: sounds like you just want to be mad for no reason 4Head @emnitthy
[1:14:50] bannad: for anyone coming late, Ambition is doing great, Echo is doing "Weird Stuff"™
[1:14:58] denil322: go skyline !!
[1:15:01] Assirra: Look, i understand they are the favorites to winand i understand talking about them maybe 50% of the time (which is still a lot) but the casters cannot stop talking about Echo for more than a minute. It's a bit much.
[1:15:10] BlinkHeals: @emnitthy it is not common strat and the focus was on how well it would be done. I think they did the right thing and should do the same to any other team that tries that or any weird strat
[1:15:14] MrKreepz: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[1:16:01] xxAeryn: disqualify echo
[1:16:07] BlinkHeals: @Assirra what are the other teams doing that was worth watching? echo was doing a odd strat and wanted to focus on how well they did
[1:16:09] KareiTV: It's their stream to host and comment on, if you don't like it go watch someone elses stream
[1:16:10] ConcernedGaming: if Ambition's "Secret Tech" is Spellstealing Wondergrow, literally the go to MDI tactic and thinks they are pulling a fast one on Echo with this, thats hillarious

[1:17:28] madhatterui: positive mental attitude, let's go get hype!
[1:17:35] 11000BG: why do people want a team getting banned? would it make more fun or what wrong with you guys?
[1:17:42] muyuu: @substantialphallus ambition only i think
[1:17:46] brucezhu: gonna be hard for skyline to time
[1:17:46] GUY_IN_CHAT_xdd: these degen strats are what makes this fun in the first place. why are people mad? I want people to break the game for timesaves
[1:17:50] BlinkHeals: @xxAeryn most teams are streaming seperately you can just go watch the one you like
[1:17:51] emnitthy: @toonthekid I mean in nw you snap and still have a 5 man team kill the boss, you don’t have a tank and healer on the boss and the other 3 barely doing anything

[1:18:32] smoces: tickle57Wth
[1:18:36] BlinkHeals: @11000BG People are just upset that echo who is known to be the best M+ team is doing a strat that no one else is.

[1:19:26] HowImetYourProbe: @BlinkHeals No really upset. Just feels bad for other teams that are clearly not abusing the game
[1:19:28] Sumirina: @virloo hard to say. they probably didn't know before, so they'd have to make a call right now... and also, everyone is playing around borers in that dungeon, so it's not such an easy call
[1:19:28] fokare: What do you guys think invising the prides is LULW

[1:20:03] ozhuun: tettles LUL
[1:20:05] fokare: @tettles TRUE LUL
[1:20:06] 11000BG: @HowImetYourProbe and you decide its a bit of extreme? :) i get it, but their strat is still slower then ambiton. i think we should just enjoy it for few more hours and let bliizard decide later what to do with dungeon
[1:20:06] HecticSpaniard: it'll be okay chat, relax :)

[1:20:10] spectrashock: they need the fungalmancer for 3rd and 4th boss

[1:22:09] BlinkHeals: @emnitthy always 1 or 2 in m+ overall standings according to radier io and im pretty sure they won every MDI they have been in it
[1:22:11] Warcraft: Follow @WoWEsports on Twitter for updates, memes and more!
[1:22:13] Saggiv: Sheesh having that brilliant 26 DoS out of the way aswell. Looking good
[1:22:14] andrilopis: what does WF mean?
[1:22:22] jerrydacarry: @double_shine I agree but with Echos PF strats and Ambition already on a 26, it will be hella close
[1:22:25] fox5523: Do the plagueborers explosion deal more damage on fortified?
[1:22:26] Lukasgate: @krysch im 1800 io wbu
[1:22:26] SpicyGamerGG: @lucko84 yeah he dced
[1:22:28] Chaddyboy96: world first
[1:22:28] seteleechete: Could do SD 26 + 27 PF and win with that DOS run
[1:22:28] miniath_: @andrilopis world first
[1:22:35] venatrixeterna: @lucko84 Frag is aggro'ing plagueborers to snap them to group.
[1:22:37] Saggiv: WF = World First- Which means it havent been done before.
[1:22:44] mutelibmb: @Warcraft  we do not use twitter in EU insta :)
[1:22:45] andrilopis: @Miniath_ thx
[1:22:45] emnitthy: @blinkheals mdi and this are very different things tho, hence why this is actually entertaining to watch
[1:22:45] doubleshinetv: @jerrydacarry Yeah depends on if Sheesh gets a 26 PF or not imo
[1:22:47] Krysch: @Lukasgate big boy
[1:22:51] scientificmethhead: Tyrannical bosses difficult on tyrannical
[1:22:51] NETRAV3R: Sheesh is gonna win with that 26 DoS

[1:22:58] belphegory: why arent they showing yep ?
[1:23:00] Sumirina: @lucko84 frag is snapping plagueborers to the group
[1:23:04] Raekthechef: @mutelibmb u high bro
[1:23:06] lucko84: @venatrixeterna ah okay :D
[1:23:09] Croustys1: @JanDeGrote1 nah i mean, echo didn't 2 chest it and i heard ambition didn't use the snap tactic that's why i wonder
[1:23:16] HekticFox: @belphegory they dropped
[1:23:21] tallywackkerr: Sheese and Ambition are the clear 2 that will be winning
[1:23:26] zeushatesem: yep quit thats why
[1:23:34] delandrosZZ: What happened to yep?
[1:23:40] BlinkHeals: @emnitthy Yes but being #1 in *** also proves they are the best m+ team. They arent #1 all the time but they are consistently 1 or 2
[1:23:41] savke3: nagura is trolling hard
[1:23:44] doubleshinetv: @barcroft14 nah Echo's PF strat has potential to carry
[1:23:47] MeavesPT: Do they have to grind their own keystones or can they just create a keystone for the run they want to do?
[1:23:49] Dwn003: Echo barely timed the 24 with snapping and we are talking about 28s?
[1:23:58] belphegory: @HekticFox ok ?
[1:24:05] NETRAV3R: @barcroft14 nah echo will beat ambition
[1:24:07] IceQ1337: @MeavesPT they craft them
[1:24:10] Red_Queen____: @MeavesPT they are on TR, so they can make their keystones
[1:24:11] Tickwick: echo's start scales to 28
[1:24:11] Kelarea: echo messed up on that run tho
[1:24:12] tallywackkerr: @MeavesPT Ambition mastered the PF strat before any other
[1:24:13] milsolo: Andybrew PogChamp
[1:24:14] Grimelush: @Dwn003 their tactic scale with the level of the key
[1:24:15] Adernium: Thing to remember is that plagueborer damage scales faster than mob hp, so it will probably scale faster
[1:24:17] JustLewlies: @Dwn003 Of course lol
[1:24:22] Kelarea: so if they don't mess up, it will be way better
[1:24:22] delandrosZZ: is there a tweet for yep quitting?
[1:24:24] cpmd4: @Dwn003 Plagueborer damage scales with key level so
[1:24:24] dank_nuggs: @Dwn003 cuz the strat scales
[1:24:31] king_tryndameres_son: @Dwn003 not sure if you're low IQ but plagueborer dmg scales with key level.
[1:24:32] Shadarek: @Adernium it scales the same.
[1:24:38] zeushatesem: @delandrosZZ maybe go look?
[1:24:42] BlinkHeals: @Dwn003 the borers scale up so essentially they could manage to do this endlessly until the just die to pasive damage
[1:24:52] milsolo: The plagueborers damage scale but tyran should scale harder
[1:24:52] Nesciuss: Ambition abusing fungalmancer while echo abusing plagueborer LUL

[1:40:35] elProha: @themontymole but the higher the key the higher the plagueborer dmg
[1:40:38] zeushatesem: @themontymole they messed up a lot in that 24 run
[1:40:40] BlinkHeals: @themontymole the damage from the mobs they are snapping scales and they are doing most of the damage

[1:41:22] syrikk: why do they keep saying that.
[1:41:32] themontymole: @emnitthy that is the question

[1:46:20] zeushatesem: why is nobody talking about growl? only see this wildi guy?
[1:46:21] bannad: @shew The hunter is aggroing them, then feigning. Their aggro is global
[1:46:23] bosse_brun: @ayohae Either that or 24 = 1 point, 25 = 2 points ETC
[1:46:27] KareiTV: @shew they have global combat, hunter FD's
[1:46:38] baderg66: It’s scale with key lol
[1:46:38] adrianqt: pretty sure echo's strat actually got like a minute faster going from 24->25

[1:57:28] Tussep: @themontymole if you're referring to the casters talking a lot about Echo, it's probably because they just showed off a strategy that none of them have seen before
[1:57:32] Grortraugh: lel
[1:57:34] blort___: frag says they talked about it in the MDI

[2:02:32] Kahlandra: @Pulsarite its not a cheat strat, so no
[2:02:35] FugitiveMind_: echo playing with 2 tanks??
[2:02:36] JustLewlies: @Pulsarite WHY
[2:02:37] HekticFox: red puddle casters
[2:02:42] Unholytree: @Pulsarite Not a "cheat" tho, so no
[2:02:42] cjayen: @Pulsarite ?
[2:02:43] swordart_19: How is rogie porting
[2:02:43] anduil_: @Pulsarite Why would they
[2:02:48] doubleshinetv: @agreb25 they were so far behind all 5 teams. Probably didn't want to spend 6 hours wiping
[2:02:49] richtea1978: Why is it cheating?
[2:02:50] Adr3naliine: @Pulsarite ??? Why LUL
[2:02:52] HawkyLR: did drJay forfait?
[2:02:54] nickrotic: They literally have GMs in the runs with them, if it wasn't allowed they would've stopped it
[2:02:57] JKMGR33N: @Warcraft Gingi isnt hiding his buffs? what are you talking about casters
[2:02:59] Shearin77: why would echo get disqualified for being smart
[2:02:59] inFi187: no way anyone will time a higher pf than +27 with much luck
[2:03:02] grimley_: "Team compositions can feature any number of Tanks, Healers, and DPS roles totaling 5 players." from the ruleset
[2:03:07] Gatobekittenme: @Pulsarite how is snapping a cheat strat
[2:03:24] madhatterui: slootS
[2:03:36] Athinira: Bear doesn't stream anymore
[2:03:37] GrebboGaming: @double_shine still lame they just give up, there could've been another team there that didn't quit lol
[2:03:38] bezerkaaaa: they'll wipe for sure
[2:03:42] swordart_19: @grimley_ there is limit on specs?
[2:03:46] JKMGR33N: @Pulsarite 2 tank cheat strat LUL LUL LUL
[2:04:00] Gurkeway: @Pulsarite wasnt it supposed to be removed going into legion?
[2:04:03] Krasis: DTB learning the borer strat live
[2:04:03] MysticKim: did they just change the strat? why is Frag with them?
[2:04:03] emnitthy: @agreb25 that other team didn’t qualify, they did
[2:04:04] Knoxsteady: @JKMz_ members in Echo definitely are
[2:04:04] madhatterui: F sheesh
[2:04:08] spectrashock: it reset yea
[2:04:10] kasmatt12: where are YEP even at?
[2:04:10] 324bee21: So many haters here just deciding for themselves that Echo is "cheating," even though the actual rules say ohterwise
[2:04:12] doubleshinetv: @agreb25 There was no chance though, like why force them to finish
[2:04:13] Dominyum: it reset
[2:04:15] Dironmonk: ambition wiped
[2:04:15] Kael88: One of each class max
[2:04:21] Red_Queen____: @Pulsarite If you read the rules, they can have 2 tanks, just not two of the same tank
[2:04:21] TheSinChao: Ambition didnt snap the fungalmancer correctly
[2:04:22] Minisodaa: shushi buffet
[2:04:26] ZanahoriaCR: RaccAttack
[2:04:33] Spookydeath: honestly its annoying that dungeons are almost always 1 tank 1 heal 3 dps, it should be sometimes more than 1 tank or more than 1 healer
[2:04:34] 324bee21: @Krasis I can't believe they are wasting time doing that so dumb
[2:04:46] murtokqt: @kasmatt12 They were kjinda behind so decided to ff today
[2:04:47] Cruzzioz: @324bee21 what did they do? :)
[2:04:47] swordart_19: YOu are saying chat they cant stack same damage spec but cant stack tanks ?
[2:04:57] Ramoneko: ambition eset =/
[2:05:04] xhinixd: @Spookydeath thats what raids are for
[2:05:08] WabzPlays: @324bee21 they've given up
[2:05:13] Gurkeway: @Spookydeath but it already takes an hour waiting for a single tank, imagine waiting for 2
[2:05:13] arcturio77: Looks like they figured it out though
[2:05:14] menhirus: hunters pog? yesterday there were no hunters, right? what happened
[2:05:14] hyperionai: I think ambition's strat is going to be more inconsistent than echo's for 27/28
[2:05:15] doubleshinetv: @324bee21 If they think the Plagueborer strat is only way to do 27 it's good idea
[2:05:18] Ivoree: dead tank kekw

[2:17:43] furlyghost14: idk man, the allure of great push was it was closer to live. 2 tank in a key is not relatable.......

[2:18:43] mikotherogue: they werent in the pool, they were outside which is why she thought they didnt hit
[2:18:50] Lowon: @bearfaced4 If you have a balance on your live group then you have an off spec tank... play the class not the spec, so it's pretty relatable
[2:18:58] Ivoree: do you think echo will try PF 27 or another dungeon?
[2:18:59] Dwn003: I don’t it funny that the casters don’t know what’s going on in the other runs. Only watching Echo 🤣

[2:19:53] mati3464: @singhkhk  use brain
[2:20:00] Shacalicious_: @singhkhk it it was cheating they would've been stopped already
[2:20:05] bannad: Ambition isn't getting weird enough
[2:20:06] Athinira: singhkhk It's not cheating. They're doing nothing that isn't allowed. It's called clever use of game mechanics
[2:20:09] bezerkaaaa: @singhkhk so they can snap the nw boss but echo cant snap mobs, sounds fair
[2:20:15] azarn01: singhkhk it'w not cheating, it using the mecanics a way bli² had think of
[2:20:16] Soliddus: lol, Echo timesd it with 3 minutes spare pretty much

[2:21:17] tedligety: @oliveoilbro yes
[2:21:18] cpmd4: nerd rage about "exploits", never change chat
[2:21:20] p_i_p_p_i_n: Is there any explanation how they farm score?
[2:21:20] Aneas: @theDevium how is it an exploit?! think before ranting... snapping tactics have been a thing since the first MDI
[2:21:23] azarn01: @oliveoilbro yep
[2:21:25] cbbl: snapping isnt an exploit ...
[2:21:26] Zzekar: @thedevium its not exploiting at all ... its 100% blizz’s fault for designing this abomination
[2:21:27] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel “AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik “DoA” Lonnquist, Tristan “Dratnos” Killeen, Caroline “Naguura” Forer, Joseph “Psy” Prendergast, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton, and Alex “Xyronic” Tatge
[2:21:30] MysticKim: nope the funglemancer snaps too so technically not an exploit
[2:21:32] Grortraugh: Plaguefall is the bomb?
[2:21:32] Hellgaunt: @discodenti nah
[2:21:33] Shearin77: blizz put in the snapping themselves
[2:21:34] JanDeGrote1: @ugiic its says WF in the keys that are WF
[2:21:38] TCGRebel: @swordart_19 you ain’t gonna be mad they figured out something
[2:21:40] swordart_19: literally waiting for hotfix after this clownfest what is happening in Plaguefall
[2:21:42] Madburn: tell me 1 MDI where nobody used snapping LUL
[2:21:43] NashMarco: Drjay and YEP PepeHands
[2:21:46] Firesterz: they are not fixing snapping tbh
[2:21:48] Kahlandra: its not cheating, and not an exploit, deep breath chat
[2:21:48] haselforst: who would` ve thought the second placed worldfirst raiders would come up with a different take on these dungeons? Kappa
[2:21:52] indigolifeez: nerds raging about being worse at the game than Echo players, it is to be expected
[2:21:55] swordart_19: @TCGRebel cant argue now ?
[2:21:59] xxAeryn: what do admins say about the plagueborer exploit?
[2:22:01] turkviktor: @swordart_19 its already been hotfixed,they are not gonna hotfix this
[2:22:02] oliveoilbro: lol ok thx
[2:22:03] Vernash_: 3:30 left WOW
[2:22:08] hardb0dy: You can be an echo and still admit it’s exploiting a bug
[2:22:08] fidoTimMaia: p V c mald
[2:22:10] swordart_19: @Kahlandra That is why what they did on 30 got fixed right :P
[2:22:14] ariastrasza: Snapping has been part tournaments  since BFA
[2:22:16] Nyk_: xxAeryn They say it's not an exploit. LUL
[2:22:18] Kobaaya: PF is dung of cheese
[2:22:18] WaxBalloon: I think 27 is for sure possible, 28 not sure within tonght

[2:22:28] brotan123: WhAt Do AdMiNs SaY AbOuT tHe ExPlOiT
[2:22:30] xxAeryn: @Nyk_ source?
[2:22:31] TCGRebel: @swordart_19 it’s not an argument, I won
[2:22:32] EzzLyfe: snapping isnt the question, its the permanent MD bug
[2:22:33] Kahlano: ariastraza legion*
[2:22:33] Ivoree: tbh PF is a broken dungeon, boss mechanics are cool but all exploitable mobs should not be there
[2:22:38] hardb0dy: It’s not snapping, it’s permanent misdirect
[2:22:39] Glozki: half of you have no idea what an exploit is relax
[2:22:39] dgjns: not an exploit but the other method to do the same thing was hotfixed
[2:22:39] doubleshinetv: It can not be an exploit while still being unhealthy for live
[2:22:42] sergioap3: @ariastraza legion*
[2:22:44] singhkhk: if it is not cheating, bz please Never fix it!
[2:22:45] vombas: @hardb0dy literally not a bug
[2:22:48] FINNERSz: Exploiters waaahhh BabyRage Im worse at the game waaahhh BabyRage
[2:22:50] stormymoood: um its pronounced "sheeesh"
[2:22:53] GoodguyLoubin: @EzzLyfe It's not permanent MD. It's global comabt
[2:22:53] NashMarco: they nerfed the plagueborer to a point but didnt spect what echo is doing @xxAeryn
[2:22:55] bannad: @xxAeryn Probably excited. It is a clever use of mechanics and really adding flavor to the tourney
[2:22:55] swordart_19: @ariastraza false if you did not noticed i got 95% remoevd after BFA
[2:22:55] KeepinItSurreal: People REEEing about echo strat are just babies. M+ has always been about doing weird bugs and exploits like this. It's super cool that teams figure it out. The others teams are allowed to do it
[2:22:56] Kahlandra: if this was not permitted it would have been stopped by the admin team, if it gets hotfixed after the fact then it just means that they don't want people to use this creative use of game mechanics
[2:22:59] techzz_: @EzzLyfe permanent md bug? theres no bug
[2:23:00] tobiwat: this is smart by using mechanics, how is this an exploit?
[2:23:03] swiiftt: snapping has been around along time. its not bannable its just smart use of game mechanics . just enjoy the show
[2:23:11] Nyk_: xxAeryn They fact the nerfed them once and didn't ban the players.
[2:23:13] Delacroixzz: snapping has existed since bfa LUL "ITS AN EXPLOIT BabyRage"
[2:23:13] rawrimadinosaur: did yep gave up ?
[2:23:16] NETRAV3R: every team can use the exploit so its fair play
[2:23:19] EzzLyfe: @GoodguyLoubin its not global combat, borers dont have global combat, bear stream tried it
[2:23:20] MysticKim: he's not misdirecting, he's pulling them then FD
[2:23:21] Slithicious: what is "WF" on the completed keys?
[2:23:24] swordart_19: ADMIN TEAM would LOOK LIKE CLOWNS if they would disqualiffied them watch HOTFIXING this after tournament
[2:23:28] schmokeyp: Snapping plagueborers do not show any skill whatsoever
[2:23:33] DarkShade_ES: where are DTB?
[2:23:34] azarn01: @Devereauxz since kegion
[2:23:36] ArjanaEU: @Slithicious World first
[2:23:38] Silverkoppen: snapping is not cheating, its an design flaw.
[2:23:38] Illumiina: @Slithicious World First
[2:23:38] TCGRebel: If you think snapping is cheating, you haven’t been playing/watching long….
[2:23:40] Ivoree: echo will lose if they dont time another dungeon
[2:23:44] swordart_19: What they are DOING is literally making this tournament look like JOKE
[2:23:48] ikhzi: what does (WF) stands for ??
[2:23:49] Chr0nicConsumer: BabyRage i dont understand how things work so im angrily typing in twitch chat BabyRage
[2:23:49] Droniird: Echo going for PF 27 ?
[2:23:50] EzzLyfe: @techzz_ yes there is, how else are they aggroing? They dont have global combat. Why else would the hunter use MD then cancel it themselves?
[2:23:52] Slithicious: oh sick
[2:23:53] touritowow: We all remember people snapping everything to Rezan. its just that this one only echo knew
[2:23:53] swiiftt: torgil u go do it then
[2:23:55] JustLewlies: @swordart_19 They would be disqualified right now.. stop being a clown
[2:23:58] LotusGT: This strat is nerfed in 9.1
[2:23:58] Dwn003: Today stream will be watching Echo do the same thing over and over again for 3 more hours?
[2:24:00] improvecap: @silverkoppen it's not a flaw lmao
[2:24:00] murtokqt: @swordart_19 Doubting that since its gonna be nerfed on 9.1 anyway
[2:24:01] sorimdh: Does having 2 27's vs having 1 27 matter?
[2:24:02] dank_nuggs: it is a super lame start tho that will 100% be fixed
[2:24:06] Nyk_: The only way they fix it, is making the boreres not global aggro.
[2:24:06] menhirus: can anyone explain to me what the "exploit" that everyone reeeees about is? Double thank and hunter carrying some bombers?
[2:24:07] swordart_19: @TCGRebel then it would not be 96%+ removed in Shadowlnads if  that was cse
[2:24:08] Delacroixzz: @swordart_19 your over investment on this thing is a joke
[2:24:10] ArjanaEU: @swordart_19 ANyone can do this? So stop complaining?
[2:24:12] MValta: @torgil_ why dont other teams then use that strat?
[2:24:15] Ivoree: haha they are going pf27 O M G
[2:24:16] dkwarrior4: Echo still using the bug or is playing safe? o.o
[2:24:17] QuArEnTeNa2: World First @ikhzi
[2:24:18] xxAeryn: there's no way this will last even a few weeks
[2:24:23] bannad: @swordart_19 They are making the tourney look great, lol
[2:24:25] Fr00b92: @sorimdh only if they are tied
[2:24:33] Rohaana: I doubt 28 halls is doable, they are too close the timer already and boss health on Tyrannical is gonna be nuts
[2:24:33] Corrupt733: I thought they already said they were heavily nerfing plagueborers in 9.1?
[2:24:35] bars_id: HyperMine
[2:24:35] Nyk_: menhirus Hunter hitting the Plagueborers and, Feign Deaths and they snap to the tank.
[2:24:35] haselforst: imagine ppl wwould get that mad about goldsellers and botters LULW
[2:24:40] Quandew0w: @dkwarrior4 its not a bug?
[2:24:41] FreezedDiamond: @chr0nicconsumer Explain to mehhh nowwww BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[2:24:41] itzmewz: did Yep drop out?
[2:24:47] swordart_19: @bannad nope they did that in BFA was all time low viewers.
[2:24:48] Silverkoppen: @kbags87K what'd you call it then?
[2:24:50] TCGRebel: @swordart_19 and if it wasn’t allowed, the admin team would of stopped it beginning today….
[2:24:51] bulczynski_: blame Echo cuz they are smarter then other and discover new tactic which game provide
[2:24:51] Shacalicious_: YEP
[2:24:52] sorimdh: Thanks xyro <3
[2:25:02] bulczynski_: u are non sense
[2:25:03] Glozki: @itzmewz yes
[2:25:06] bars_id: nice
[2:25:09] HecticSpaniard: thats not an exploit
[2:25:09] menhirus: @Nyk_ ty
[2:25:10] Athinira: swordart_19 How? They haven't +2'ed Plaguefall with it (unlike Ambition who +2'ed their 24), and the strat is kinda exciting
[2:25:15] spectrestare: YEP was like echo in tourny? might aswell go be useful elsewhere KEKW
[2:25:19] Blarney234: !casters
[2:25:20] Moobot: @Blarney234 Today's casters are Daniel “AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik “DoA” Lonnquist, Tristan “Dratnos” Killeen, Caroline “Naguura” Forer, Joseph “Psy” Prendergast, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton, and Alex “Xyronic” Tatge
[2:25:20] JohnnyOneLung: 🥸 achhhktuly... the first MDIs in Legion didn't have snapping! But what would happen is mobs would reset if you accidentally hit on a spot that they couldnt route to the tank. Snapping was introduced to stop this. Then competitors started using that quirk to gather up and burst down mobs
[2:25:20] EzzLyfe: Yall saying its not a bug, watch blizz hotfix MD tomorrow lmao..
[2:25:25] gilbertron: thats a big shrrom
[2:25:26] doubleshinetv: @bulsongg How DARE echo innovate and try new things
[2:25:28] improvecap: @silverkoppen an intended mechanic? do you realize how much more they could do if snapping didn't exist?
[2:25:29] dkwarrior4: @Quandew0w MD cancel aura to get inifinite time in MD  is not a bug ? o.o
[2:25:31] diivil92: where is the YEP?
[2:25:32] gurningfo: someone of sheesh team stream?

[2:25:35] streyder: WoW Dungeons content on Twitch? WOOOO!

[2:25:40] improvecap: could literally just MC mobs off platforms
[2:25:44] Raekthechef: @EzzLyfe MD has nothing to do with this strat
[2:25:45] richtea1978: When is Dratnos casting?
[2:25:47] scotticus27: what type of pizza shall I order....
[2:25:48] Razzor1590: how much time do they have left?

[2:26:10] snapshotgg: @Warcraft  ban them lol what is this meme strat
[2:26:14] chunkychug: 3ish hours
[2:26:14] Athinira: EzzLyfe It's not a bug. A bug is something that is not intended to happen. Snapping IS intended - it just wans't intended to be used in that way
[2:26:17] Silverkoppen: @kbags87K "snapping intended" big kek
[2:26:18] baderg66: Robin is really smart
[2:26:20] scotticus27: thinking chicken and bacon
[2:26:21] Fr00b92: Frag confirmed they are not just doing PF today, they are doing some other dungeons
[2:26:26] dkwarrior4: @EzzLyfe u are so wrong my bro , look at the MD at the start and look at the cancel it  and u will get MD infinite in the tank
[2:26:27] Traveler_103: 3 hours + I think last dungeon can also go over time again

[2:28:37] Flipp5gg: yes

[2:28:39] Hellgaunt: They found this tech the same day Bliz nerfed the other plagueborer strat that got them the +30 PF. So no, they didn't just test it on an m0
[2:28:40] Toastfairy1697: andy accidentally broke invis on the skip i think
[2:28:43] Syllcy: Pretty sure I saw Naowh testing the plagueborer strat on the tournament realm a week ago
[2:28:44] SskygamesS: ofcourse ofcourse Kappa

[2:28:56] muyuu: @NashMarco they abused a mindcontroll hurricane cheese on the borers, but that got fixed
[2:28:56] domax92: Jimy was probably sleeping while the others were trying on higher keys than m0 LUL
[2:28:57] billabong212: Double Dorki?
[2:29:01] Stonesaber: @Chr0nicConsumer they used an immunity on a plagueborer so it dealt the damage and didnt die
[2:29:01] Krasis: @Xyronic Frag confirmed they home cooked this strat in m0s on his stream.
[2:29:03] TutiTheSoloHealer: mage,rogue,druid- will this ever change ..
[2:29:03] djokx: I don't get why everybody says it's the first time echo do this strat; They acttualy +2 a 30 10 days ago

[2:29:47] ErorSveMoguce: @djokx that was a completely different strat they used the plagueborers but in a completely different way
[2:29:47] Madburn: naowh confirmed they did +24 to practice their strat because they did it only on m0, otherwise they would go for +2 the normal way
[2:29:48] swordart_19: @djokx with abusing bug/exploit which got lliterally FIXED after that

[2:30:33] Vernash_: @Silverkoppen every mob in the game has this teleport ability lol
[2:30:34] dgjns: the cyclone/mc strat was hotfixed because they wanted groups to use hunter FD instead
[2:30:37] swordart_19: @DaVincento goit ultra tilted imo , no face to finish it
[2:30:41] MysticKim: cause they spent all yesterday wiping on a +26 Halls and they were too far behind

[2:30:55] Santilom: @Xyronic where is yeep?
[2:30:55] improvecap: @silverkoppen that makes 0 sense. snapping exists to avoid mob abuse, specifically with platforms and phases
[2:30:57] gurningfo: they quit

[2:33:20] ty63red: who is in the lead?
[2:33:23] tomwellmaxeoni: ty
[2:33:28] dgjns: great analysis
[2:33:28] jur0: is it a 10000IQ move when dtb stream is using this run to give the hunter player time to investigate the strat details while afk'ing the run?
[2:33:31] swordart_19: @soka987 ultra tilt no face to finish it .
[2:33:32] TCGRebel: @k4rton_xd they are on youtube Kappa

[2:34:12] Moobot: @9fame Follow the standings along with Raider.IO: http://rio.gg/greatpushleaderblz
[2:34:18] swo12: this was really exciting at first with the echo strat but now it kind of deflated the tournament
[2:34:21] domax92: yap
[2:34:31] kycttv: @tettles it reset accidentally on last run
[2:34:34] shirrar: i thought blizz only streamed on youtube now?
[2:34:46] MValta: @dank_nuggs They still play.. They doesent just exit arena and leave
[2:34:55] pinkcuddlepony: so their secret strat is to copy something that everyone did in the MDI?
[2:35:00] CrerisRs: shirrar MDI and AWC per contract, other things they can stream elsewhere
[2:35:05] parano2: was their +30 a bugged run?
[2:35:06] swordart_19: @shirrar youtube and twitch this tournament
[2:35:08] NickSarien: @stancliffd lol
[2:35:10] HecticSpaniard: get over it already LUL
[2:35:11] 43germitmilch: DOA <3
[2:35:15] kycttv: MDI didn’t take it all the way through.
[2:35:15] ariastrasza: Blizz contract is only for MDI, this is not MDI.
[2:35:16] emnitthy: The tournament kinda got boring knowing that nobody will ever be able to achieve what echo did because they had a new strat
[2:35:24] dank_nuggs: @BumbaGlad true, they do just sit around waiting for the time to run out tho
[2:35:31] CrerisRs: parano2 not bugged per se, but blizzard patched the method out of the game
[2:35:37] HecticSpaniard: crying in this chat wont change a thing ingame

[2:35:50] krillandis: @emnitthy You're just a hater. They innovated. 2 Tanks? Nobody else doing that. They innovated spider boss too
[2:35:55] carlosisbroke: sheesh going to win
[2:35:56] zeushatesem: @emnitthy nobody forcing you to watch
[2:35:56] MightyGIGACHAD: @emnitthy LUL
[2:35:58] swo12: still cool to see but if they started doing the strat at 26 or 27 that would have been amazing
[2:35:59] dmonkeychachu: 1kio viewers saying boring because echo is superior kek
[2:36:03] IceQ1337: @emnitthy how can a single person be so mad about this for so long? touch some grass dude
[2:36:05] milsolo: I like Sheeesh's position still
[2:36:16] please_no_bannerino_thx: Do people still play retail? LUL
[2:36:22] bannad: Weird stuff
[2:36:25] ggokkuu: people malding over clever use of game mechanics. go time your 12s boys
[2:36:29] tedligety: what's ambition's special strat?
[2:36:31] harca: @please_no_bannerino_thx yes ?
[2:36:31] TCGRebel: @dmonkeychachuche naaah they are more upset over the snapping LUL
[2:36:35] CrerisRs: please_no_bannerino_thx weak bait
[2:36:35] Moobot: Find more from team Sheeesh here: http://blizz.ly/TeamSheeesh
[2:36:36] bulczynski_: @emnitthy so that mean they are just better and deserve for a win and if they time 27 they do
[2:36:37] md8281: guys what is ambitions special strategy?
[2:36:38] MValta: @dank_nuggs yeah, shake hands with other team and have respect to other players etc.
[2:36:41] HecticSpaniard: good comeback Kappa
[2:36:42] knudsen96: Casters?
[2:36:43] BennyWASD: I don't think echo will manage the  +28
[2:36:46] krillandis: The only team innovating is Echo... you should not hate them for that. Pulling the fungelmancer is not innovating every KSM team knows its possible lol
[2:36:49] Bezoned: i can't time 12's tho
[2:36:49] ddoocsg: Y so many sour grapes Qqing, u can go in n show how u do i.
[2:36:51] Maltenerd: What exactly does the Fungalmancer do to help the run?
[2:36:53] KeepinItSurreal: @emnitthy I stopped watching anything once I realized teams found ways to do better than other teams.
[2:36:54] JanDeGrote1: @please_no_bannerino_thx Do you still watch retail? EleGiggle
[2:36:56] BennyWASD: theyve barely made it through the 3rd boss, twice.
[2:36:57] ncoots: No way echo survives the 27
[2:37:01] TCGRebel: @ggokkuu they clearly never watched any mdi's before
[2:37:02] dank_nuggs: @emnitthy yea it's def super lame to have it come down to this strat
[2:37:02] HappyCamper_24: noahw floorpov
[2:37:12] ilovemyhamster420: rio so slow to update, cant blizz just updat it themselves on their own website?
[2:37:16] JanDeGrote1: @Maltenerd you can spell steal a buff it casts on itself
[2:37:22] mikotherogue: fungalmancer makes the mage go brrrr even more
[2:37:23] emnitthy: @bulsongg it means they had more time practicing the new meta strat for a dungeon, they came up with and they deserve credit, but the tournament is nto a display of skill anymore
[2:37:24] tingen2: Ambition strats aint new.
[2:37:30] Moobot: Find out more about the Great Push including tournament format in the viewer's guide: http://blizz.ly/TGPViewersGuide

[2:37:42] billabong212: 3hr and 50mins is basically 4hoursa
[2:37:46] tulwinn: Isn’t that the point, they are doing it better, ergo they win
[2:37:52] tardosjr: is it just me or whenever they bring on new casters xyro stays for a while after, where the other casters leave right away
[2:37:52] Ivoree: watch ambition wipe on margrave again
[2:37:54] Maltenerd: JanDeGrote1 Much appreciated my guy. SeemsGood
[2:37:57] Max0704: is the second tank so they have someone to snap stuff on to that won't die tanking stuff and break their bug?
[2:38:00] ncoots: 26 max for plaguefall too much damage for 27
[2:38:02] shivengank: LET'S GO AMBITION!!!!
[2:38:03] ilovemyhamster420: for tournament ?
[2:38:04] Onemore_time_: I seriously don't get why everybody says it's the first time echo do this strat; They acttualy +2 a 30 10 days ago
[2:38:09] Wastingmoney: "no display of skill" KEKW
[2:38:18] MrCompleks: @JothamN yes but its 2h 52m
[2:38:30] Nastradin: hmm so echo taking the mancer too
[2:38:31] natty: They used a different thing with these things for that @Onemore_time_
[2:38:35] TwixxHD: @Onemore_time_ Its a different strat...
[2:38:36] gamor12: the problem is there need to set the tank up
[2:38:37] Chr0nicConsumer: @Onemore_time_ cause they did that with mind control + cyclone + polymorph instead of feign death + snapping
[2:38:42] natty: they used to live through cyclone, so you could cyclone and they'd live
[2:38:44] qtsage: @Onemore_time_ 🤓 actshually
[2:38:46] AutomaticJak: @tardosjr Ye, he's on right now we're doin sets of 3 for casting today but 2 yday. We're not having too strict of casters rules this weekend tho
[2:38:47] dank_nuggs: @Onemore_time_ why do you keep saying this? no they did not, this is a different strat
[2:38:48] ceveth: guys he has said the same thing 20 times
[2:38:49] billabong212: @Compleks_ lol i'm dumb for some reason i thought it was 6hrs not 5
[2:38:50] Alyriin: dtbs havent figured out how to snap to this boss yet though
[2:38:52] md8281: what is ambitions strat?
[2:38:53] vliito: @tardosjr good point
[2:38:57] RisingCosmos: Does 27 seem doable with Ambition's current strat? or would they need to adopt Echo's strat to clear a 27?
[2:39:02] swiiftt: imagine if they kept the 30 strat for this chat would be malding even more LOL
[2:39:13] Ivoree: ok now sheeesh has to time one more dungeon
[2:39:17] D1Chile: @Warcraft  u think the plague borer strat and fungalmaster  start can be done  at same time  cause that could yeild stunning result in the future
[2:39:38] Hinzir: with JP cone trick they bring fungal down
[2:39:39] Deadlyvenom444: @RisingCosmos  Prob no bro.Even for echo with this strat 27 will be super hard
[2:39:43] Cyke72: Vive mamoky
[2:39:49] Sound_Tony: Did YEP give up?
[2:39:50] ddoocsg: Anyone Sheeesh is from which Guild or country?
[2:39:56] swordart_19: @D1Chile Watch these clowns fixing it after tournament
[2:39:58] randramb: This chat seems to have extraordinarily short memory, the Method Team which Gingi was part of back in LEGION MDI were already innovating new strategies, and even the ones that got banned from use in compeitive play going forward were permitted for the remainder of THAT tournament run, so there's a shedload of complaining about something that won't happen
[2:40:01] NeoS0923: @D1Chile You better twitter this out
[2:40:03] Asteriix1: @Sound_Tony yep

[2:40:14] RisingCosmos: @swordart_19 They're EU
[2:40:23] themontymole: oh  man will echo time this 27 though?
[2:40:24] Ivoree: Sheeesh is Pieces EU guild

[2:40:32] swiiftt: u guys just sad ur teams r losing im just enjoying the show take a step back and think y are u angry theres legit no reason it doesnt effect ur life in anyway shape or form
[2:40:45] davitaa: is it final day?
[2:40:47] BennyWASD: we'll see if echo can deal with 3rd boss + rains from last boss.
[2:40:49] dgjns: @randramb shedload u wot mate?

[2:41:03] Koloblicino: YEP Sadge
[2:41:03] emnitthy: having an opinion on smth doesnt mean people are angry
[2:41:06] swordart_19: @The_Sneaky_Goose it buffs itself magic buff and mage can spell steal and then buff itself
[2:41:06] v1perr: @The_Sneaky_Goose spell steal damage buff

[2:45:45] hyperionai: 0.33% repeating of course
[2:45:54] MrCompleks: @dasru first tie breaker is highest key. Second tie breaker is time spent in total in the completed runs

[2:47:10] frequencybandit: Did yep drop out?
[2:47:10] Persuaded83: more significant is that it's 10% of the current day
[2:47:11] Athinira: w1zduMx Of course they can compete. Echo is not flawless. But it's an uphill battle
[2:47:12] Wastingmoney: man shaks streaming days were sooo fun
[2:47:15] meim1234: grats for them for finding new strats
[2:47:25] stabzmcgeee: also keep in mind this isnt echos normal team,,, nothing against maystine but i wonder what they could have doen with meeres playing

[2:49:24] swordart_19: tettles got tangled in own ltongue lUL
[2:49:30] mikkeal0: @aquinnemaidenn for the 3rd boss, they seperate the boss and the spawned ads

[2:49:38] mksmoke55: you will see at this 3rd boss why 2tanks
[2:49:47] Pandiiten: oh no, they f'd up their skip
[2:49:58] Sumirina: @aquinnemaidenn on third boss they separate adds from boss and snap plagueborers on the boss

[2:52:29] Loye: Echo killed that boss btw
[2:52:32] MakzzTV: frag is MDing them to naowh, its similar to the necrotic wake bug with angels where you have permanent MD in the dungeon

[2:54:17] botmastercrash: why is WoW back on twitch?
[2:54:18] drtylaw: plagueborers do global aggro @hardb0dy

[2:54:33] techzz_: @Chr0nicConsumer BECAUSE ITS A BUG THEY ARE ABUSING? XD
[2:54:33] shinlul: this plagueborer strat is so degenerate
[2:54:44] sverrepuz: It might be some beacon healing or something
[2:54:45] GeGeeWellPlayed: It's not healing aggro, sometime Frag can only get one to snap. It's all Frag
[2:54:45] FINNERSz: @Dankmanarmy no and you get banned LULW

[2:54:56] Asteriix1: @botmastercrash it's on both twitch and youtube. MDI is exclusive to youtube but not this
[2:54:56] techzz_: @scherri5 u blind or what, he is 100% pressing MD before every pull

[2:55:04] kotakekw: 30 very easy
[2:55:05] What_ln_Tarnation: twitch chat has keyed +30 across the board
[2:55:09] Athinira: techzz_ It's not a bug. It's unintended use of game mechanics
[2:55:10] alandiamond12: multiple exploits. yay. so much fun. thanks Echo.  awesome.

[2:55:36] kopocaban3: I guess a lot asked already,  ut whar happened tonechos 30 strat with rigged plagueborer? Not allowed?
[2:55:39] Athinira: A bug is something that is not supposed to happen. Unintended use of game mechanics is something that is intended to happen, but where the developers didn't think all aspects of it trhrough
[2:55:39] Disrael1: they are really good

[2:56:18] IamSonder: So frag is just afk at plagueborers?
[2:56:20] drtylaw: @Rankarwow Blizzard added snapping themselves...
[2:56:22] Sumirina: they got "one mushroom" :D
[2:56:23] Tweeeka: @alandiamond12 exploits? kidding me? xD more like using the mechanics in a smart way ^^
[2:56:23] techzz_: jesus christ u people saying plaugeborers are global combat and hes not using MD are blind or something
[2:56:27] scherri5: @rankarwow all bfa dungeons were about snapping ...
[2:56:27] OzTnj: thats not strat thats just abusing
[2:56:28] kopocaban3: Ok thx
[2:56:30] vliito: ECHO asked Blizzard before the run if they could use this strat and the answer was yes.
[2:56:32] CrerisRs: techzz_ if you cant explain how they are doing dont call bug abuses
[2:56:35] losmijr: WoWEsports on twitter is posting MEMES about this strat. It's obviously allowed.
[2:56:46] Athinira: emnitthy Still doesn't make it a bug. The snapping is an intended mechanic.
[2:56:48] Jouricarver: Funny how snapping was made to stop people doing cheese and here it is being used to there advantage
[2:56:52] azarn01: @IamSonder he aggro add and fd to make them snap to the rest of his team
[2:56:55] Kahlandra: this strat is permitted, snapping has never been against the rules of mdi
[2:56:56] Nyk_: techzz_ Are you trolling? daphLol

[2:57:00] losmijr: Like, the official WoW account on twitter approves it, stop calling it not allowed or a bug.
[2:57:05] CrerisRs: techzz_ so how is he doing 300y out of sight MD then?
[2:57:10] Kahlandra: snapping was put into the game to stop mobs from evade bugging

[2:57:26] dank_nuggs: @Athinira snapping is intended but abusing it like this is not
[2:57:26] IamSonder: @azarn01 haha rip, guess my hunter will be afk snapping borers in the furute for teams
[2:57:31] techzz_: @CrerisRs its a bug where you cancelaura at the start of the dungeon so it becomes global, its legit 100% exploit

[4:11:15] Seraak: what happend to sheesh?
[4:11:20] aocAorus: NO Echo is going for the 28 to finish this off
[4:11:22] Frag0n: When does the race end?
[4:11:24] Sumirina: is this time-tiebreaker or is it because they timed more 27s?
[4:11:25] SeathVII: 28 plaguefall

[4:11:32] Vwlpe: why would they ban them? lol
[4:11:32] yipzen: @SeakerOpiDopi why would they?
[4:11:35] seteleechete: Echo and sheesh should both try and lower their time in my opinion

[4:12:17] Shyxlol: Is total time normalised to dungeon time?
[4:12:18] hzwo: @pseudo_nathan they need a 26 SD not halls
[4:12:19] emnitthy: It snot snapping its misdirection being bugged
[4:12:21] Versiondk: Snapping were one of the most used strats in BFA MDI please chat they were just smart to think of it
[4:12:22] tsurghat: i hope blizz checks this strat 100% out, that seems not like it should be allowed in a comp. env

[4:12:39] LeBeanJD: @AutomaticJak are you saying this is being done just from snaps? I thought the casters already pointed out they're doing it using a misdirect bug?
[4:12:40] MasterKjn: did sheesh tilt after wipes and give up on tourney

[4:13:35] katana_rider: Just got watch Fragnance's stream if you want to know how it is done
[4:13:38] Xierany: @gaminggoblin mechanic is intentional, way it's being used is probably not

[4:13:58] emnitthy: Does the bear tries to do that, for an hour, misdirection bug is the key component
[4:13:59] Sannitie: Ambition is definitely not going to be fastest assuming they barely time this 27
[4:14:02] Iliasuu: @AutomaticJak echo has been commenting and showcasing toxic behavior towards ambition due to the fact that they chose not to stream their strats in pf
[4:14:04] Vy3x: @harca see escape plan toy

[4:14:58] emnitthy: @scherri5 a mod in chat literally just admitted that there is a bug how dense are you
[4:14:59] Lowon: @Iliasuu Toxic behaviour? How old are you? They both teams are just memeing abou each other
[4:15:00] losmijr: Rip ambition, 2 seconds :(

[4:15:25] Shacalicious_: @Iliasuu if u think that what either of what the teams has said is toxic or such, KEKW. its just memes

[4:23:10] denil322: @rozz2222 they  like bug for win
[4:23:13] baseboned: @rozz2222 they think pf 28 is more likely and worth double due to the tiebreaker
[4:23:14] Ppoggie: monkaS
[4:23:22] ThaOriginalGamester: POG
[4:23:24] Thepeanut891: Why did YEP forfeit? The link doesn’t provide much information.
[4:23:27] zeushatesem: @Nathenios why would they do 26 when they all have 27 hoa`?
[4:23:27] Sebik: @jbwow01 there might be on tournament realm but not on live

[4:23:51] HekticFox: @Thepeanut891 they punted day 2 and were way too far behind
[4:23:52] skrotax89: @tsuqini haha the amount of butthurt NA makes this a double win
[4:23:52] JaxsunTV: Sheesh = PL Over 9000
[4:23:55] ariastrasza: There is no problem that can't be solved with the strategic placement of high explosives.
[4:23:56] Red_Queen____: @Thepeanut891 they decided that they were too far behind and chose to not continue
[4:23:57] NateYoungTV: @Thepeanut891 they didn't believe they had a shot at a comeback and didn't want to waste their time today
[4:23:59] dank_nuggs: @TheDadBodGod well tbf we don't know what they said was fine, but infinite MD seems like pretty a clear bug
[4:23:59] Thepeanut891: Ahh I see thanks
[4:23:59] kaeyna: +23 prides are already hard to heal, 28 is insane to hold
[4:24:01] OortCloudBig: frag is literally so afk he reading all his stream chat lmao
[4:24:02] Bovinity: Not sure why people are shocked when teams pull out weird strats to push cutting edge stuff in a race setting.
[4:24:05] jbwow01: @Warcraft @Sebik if you dont think that volcanic is a huge debuff for your peeps then you dont know or what is going on

[4:24:31] jabroni07: how do they keep spawning borers out of nowhere
[4:24:32] Mininds: yes
[4:24:38] ConcernedGaming: the key to getting this on 28, or even 29, will be timing the Plagueborer shipments on last boss so they don't die to the disease
[4:24:39] kodaema: @Player089 yes
[4:24:40] SyriosOne: @Player089 yes

[4:25:58] UpadlySzczurr: skyline still can win if they do 27 pf and than 26 sd
[4:26:00] Elysianlight: @AnticsLiveTV i hope so, normally id be okay with echo, but dont want them to win because this is some cheesy bs
[4:26:00] sakura_2020: @thekrogholm don't they are streaming
[4:26:01] jbwow01: @Warcraft @Sebik the amount of time that you have not casting because of Volcatic
[4:26:05] Player089: So Echo is currently doing better than Ambition? Impressive! Considering ambition has been pushing high keys all the time
[4:26:17] FollowSlz: replace bear screen to sheeeesh

[4:26:58] greenay11: imagine crying about something that impacts you 0%
[4:27:00] krillandis: @emnitthy it's not a bug lmao. If anything it's innovation. I'd rather see different strats than the same route for everyone
[4:27:02] ratrexw: @emnitthy BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[4:27:02] Technics83: Blizzard would never punish the best and biggest guild
[4:27:02] fidoTimMaia: Bug abuse = my team can't put a big start on work.... stop crying
[4:27:03] derTikimann: @thekrogholm doesnt really matter if they stream or not. LUL there are 2 admins in there watching
[4:27:06] MiniMachter: to be fair echo could have done 30+ Pf with old strat but the did not wanted to do it in the tourney so they made it public for it to get fixed
[4:27:10] dank_nuggs: @TheDadBodGod again, you don't know that for sure
[4:27:13] jbwow01: its a TON
[4:27:14] AmhoeTV: F
[4:27:26] lastmanstand07: sheeeeshhhooo
[4:27:30] marchippp: They are basically all abusing mechanics to some level, just that Echo's scaled better
[4:27:31] Dullindal: @Krillandis @krillandis How is it not!? They make misdirect last forever
[4:27:33] emnitthy: @krillandis it’s a bug the moment you need to bug out a skill in order to have it active non stop
[4:27:34] 324bee21: People complain about MDI every single comp is the same... Echo does something wildy different here and people still complain
[4:27:34] mattchewk: theres a fire going on in naowhs apartment LOL hes gaming through it though
[4:27:34] mikotherogue: this one will be fixed on live servers too
[4:27:37] Versiondk: @emnitthy You're fine with pulling a mob for 30min through the dungeon to "use" for last boss but not snapping boars cause that is "abuse"? :)
[4:27:42] vaereee: @TheDadBodGod takes a ton of skill to hit feign death
[4:27:43] ThriftWeasel: whats goin on here are they racing or something?
[4:27:44] TheDadBodGod: @dank_nuggs I don't know if you're dense or trolling, but the mods have literally said Echo's strat, all elements of it, is fine

[4:28:01] thekrogholm: I just want to watch the non PF dungeon tbh!
[4:28:09] Player089: @zeushatesem Hm, why aren't you? Seems like the Ambition team should have a lot more practice and trying to time high keys, while the echo team did mostly prep for MDI aka fast mid-high keys, no?
[4:28:11] RisingCosmos: @Zoodwow yep

[4:28:22] bannad: @Cujodk so much better than MDI

[4:28:41] lord_rimheart: @Versiondk this only works because of the perma MD bug :)
[4:28:41] TheLesbianMan: I think JPC and his personality disorder should win, it's only fair...as he sees it.
[4:28:48] GUY_IN_CHAT_xdd: imagine getting mad at people using insane strats to clear insanely hard content. lets just ban pride skipping too because thats not the intended way to play the affix
[4:28:49] scherri5: @mods   can you timeout these missdirect lies spreading?
[4:28:52] Tussep: @ThriftWeasel69 In a way. Every team get points according to how high of a key they can push
[4:28:52] TheDadBodGod: Yeah, the feign death stuff isn't too intensive, but everything else is
[4:28:55] AutumnWinds7: @Neekapkilla  yes they said maybe, also latter confirmed that they dont know
[4:28:56] zeushatesem: @Player089 because what max said is true
[4:28:59] tekkz610: shocker, Echo using 3xploits

[4:31:22] cleanner1: @textio545 the hunter is staying where they spawn and misdirecting them to the tank, since they're too far apart they teleport to the tank
[4:31:24] krillandis: @vaereee don't whisper me then prevent me from whispering you. Leave me alone
[4:31:28] hilavitkutin: that bear pull tho on sheesh

[4:32:28] Tussep: Skyline is crazy fast on the time tiebreaker compared to the others
[4:32:28] Player089: @zeushatesem And he said something that would get you banned? Doesn't make sense to me. Let me take a wild guess: does it have smth to do with comparing the skill it takes to WoF raid and push m+?
[4:32:28] Elysianlight: @TheBonnieB if youd take 2 minutes to stop wondering and check raiderio, youd see they forfeited

[5:09:28] yochoc: the 26 DoS was flawless and still extremely tight on time @krova
[5:09:28] Sumirina: @rozz2222 wild guess, because they believe it's easier for them than some of the 26s they are missing?
[5:09:29] odawgxd: +2 min for ambition. They cant cut it
[5:09:29] Chachgg: 20 min

[5:10:07] Dankmanarmy: +
[5:10:13] rozz2222: @Sumirina 26 dos or 28 pf seems way more timeable than a 27 top so idk about that one

[5:12:10] RedBull: no prot pally though :(
[5:12:13] elProha: @yochoc but what else is then. they wont time a 28 pf with their strat
[5:12:20] simplepathjg: doesnt ambition run warrior for top all the time on live?

[5:19:14] elProha: i would really hate for echo to win with a cheese strat like this tbh
[5:19:17] BlackDeath667: Come on Yep i believe you can do it, lets go YEP
[5:19:19] losmijr: Skyline will not be above Echo after this 25 btw
[5:19:22] periperus: Echo is the only team that controls their own destiny now.
[5:19:27] gfkoe: ambition going for tiebreaker
[5:19:30] rozz2222: i dont think this time from skyline will overtake will it?
[5:19:32] substantialphallus: Why are the streams so far behind the source?
[5:19:34] dank_nuggs: @wuyubohehe well thanks for spoiling it...
[5:19:35] imKennart: @elProha How is the fungus less cheese?
[5:19:37] losmijr: Skyline will be over a minute below echo after this 25
[5:19:44] handsomebizarre: are we already beyond the deadline to start dungeons?
[5:19:44] Nakloh: Yeah Skyline will finish sloppy 25 and go again
[5:19:48] Ivoree: is anyone from sheeesh streaming?
[5:19:50] losmijr: @rozz2222 Nope, Echo will be in the lead
[5:19:50] DehCantao: commentators are summing the times, but information panel says is relative to the total dungeon time.
[5:19:55] VidelleTV: @breakthewalls They'll win by time if Echo doesnt time
[5:19:56] QookiTV: Only 10 min left, they can continue beyond the time?
[5:19:57] ragectl: what is all this? dungeon speed runs?

[5:20:21] Bammy009: @elProha It's not a cheese strat, lol. My team lost to Fem's last expansion because they practiced snapping and we did not. Snapping is and will always be allowed, because snapping itself is an anti-cheat mechanic.
[5:20:22] AuroryClaire: NOOOOOOOOOO

[5:21:37] DehCantao: nice job blizz, not even commentators know the tie break, imagine the players
[5:21:37] KewTroll: @Entrian They didn't MD. It's just global aggro from the Plagueborers from that miniboss, so Frag Feign Deaths and then they just TP to nearest target they are in combat with lol

[5:21:44] Marksterrrr: cant they just finish and still have time to start over?

[5:52:15] cowmoo2000: brew
[5:52:16] Keppie__: Hunter
[5:52:16] raikoneN_: brewmaster for sure
[5:52:17] Nexmatra: fraggy did 4 aswell

[5:53:12] Dutzie: Idk how everyone loses their mind over the echo strat, but noone bats an eye when in BFA MDI half of the dungeon gets snapped onto a boss
[5:53:16] bozzymodo: It’s nothing to do with misdirect you sap
[5:53:16] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel “AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik “DoA” Lonnquist, Tristan “Dratnos” Killeen, Caroline “Naguura” Forer, Joseph “Psy” Prendergast, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton, and Alex “Xyronic” Tatge
[5:53:17] SaltWoW: @Tierer They didnt use permanent misdirect, its global aggro
[5:53:19] hathor_: @knightswithkiera It's called not washing it
[5:53:21] ThaOriginalGamester: i forgot skyline was still playing Keepo

[5:53:23] Devinespiritgm: can WE watch Skyline properly plz?
[5:53:25] just_ok_viewer: DOA sounds like he should be casting the super bowl
[5:53:25] TCGRebel: @Malenkyy did he play anything?
[5:53:30] Nisaro: Should have went with tyrannical sanguine and watch them struggle with the 24s LUL
[5:53:45] herclure_tv: YEP LUL KEKW OMEGALUL PEPEGA
[5:53:50] deimoskiri: ty for fullscreen
[5:53:52] consmallthumbs: tbh max was implying echo would win easily, not really the case, could have gone either way
[5:54:02] TCGRebel: @korous1 not a bug
[5:54:04] herclure_tv: "top tier players" --> forfait
[5:54:06] Neyphilia: @dutzie Its not the snapping. They use a bug that makes misdirect permament
[5:54:07] andremonology_: @dutzie that was on the last patch? lol the dungeon scaling is a lot different from that
[5:54:09] Azzizz007: Who decided to name this “the great push” ?
[5:54:26] eumo_: Azzizz007 your mum
[5:54:26] Moobot: Broadcast starts Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 10am Pacific / 7pm CEST. Players have 5 hours each day to push the dungeons.
[5:54:26] Rotheia: fragnance capability to performance so dam good with a lot of classes/specs makes him the best wow player by far, this guy is insane

[5:54:47] SuperSionT: Annie are you ok ?
[5:54:49] Malenkyy: his background is sc2 but chose to go down caster route instead of pro player @TCGRebel
[5:54:50] UltraSpinach: s1lverH s1lverH I wish there were some warlock action, but it seems iit will never happen during this expansion
[5:54:55] clearsenpai_: @Megumin_Noire no, plagueborers just have global threat, if you saw fragnances POV he had no misdirection in hi buff

[5:55:12] AquaYoo: Are you ok Annie?
[5:55:12] Magymaster: oof
[5:55:12] Tenivir: They are doing the orbs badly there
[5:55:21] Dutzie: @breakwater It's not about the amout of mobs, its about the "snapping" @Megumin_Noire Get your facts right, he aggros them, the mobs global aggro onto the whole team and then he feign deaths to drop aggro. He doesn't even use misdirect and certainly not for infinity
[5:55:21] herr_nie: @megumin_noire they didnt misdirect a Single time, do your research
[5:55:23] SuperSionT: KEKW
[5:55:26] Neyphilia: @clearsenpai_ read the wowhead article. It doesnt work without the bug

[5:57:25] rjhenator: if it really was a MD bug that let echo do that strat the entire tourney is tainted
[5:57:26] seteleechete: I think you got that wrong they should get second at 40 something minutes
[5:57:28] qweps: @Warcraft hello when is the next major update :)

[5:58:42] Simplypewpew: @TCGRebel You are wrong. They did always md'ed at the start.
[5:58:44] sinlesssinner: @kaithegreatt Qing with skyline?? i thought he was with ambition lol
[5:58:45] seteleechete: They don't need 38
[5:58:45] Elkethus: @MerakiPlays they wip on the last boss of plaguefall
[5:58:46] Asteriix1: @MerakiPlays depleted their 27
[5:58:46] CH1LL1E: @BumbaGlad why would it :)
[5:58:47] Arilin: @Arilin Yes, it was used and expired to have it last the whole dungeon
[5:58:49] DatSirOnTheLeft: @MerakiPlays wiped last poss
[5:58:51] streyder: @m0lybdenum42 yes
[5:58:51] horsewithnooname: THUNDER THUNDER THUNDER WOW
[5:58:51] Wastingmoney: @Technics83 doesnt sounds like
[5:58:56] herclure_tv: SALTY BOYS HAHHA
[5:59:00] TCGRebel: @MissAvantasia soooo bold, gonna trigger so many people
[5:59:05] MValta: @CH1LL1E To stop using a bug :)
[5:59:18] herr_nie: @pieceofpanic but scripted always same bossfights are any better? LUL
[5:59:19] Technics83: @Wastingmoney its your fault then
[5:59:20] RyanD1909: Check the new wowhead post. Literally explains the MD bug. They CANNOT snap without the global combat that the MD bug gives
[5:59:21] HaruForense: PogChamp
[5:59:22] yankovic_: the spites give the venthyr buff
[5:59:31] kaithegreatt: @sinlesssinner I thought he's on YEP ? lol
[5:59:31] Moobot: The top 6 competing teams can be found here: https://twitter.com/WoWEsports/status/1397347607437975552
[5:59:31] Spexerino: how would they otherwise spawn under naowh all the time
[5:59:34] Wastingmoney: @Technics83 delusional
[5:59:35] MissAvantasia: @tcgrebel Imagine being so bad moders you get triggered by winners. 🤣
[5:59:39] What_ln_Tarnation: is this china team?
[5:59:43] kaithegreatt: yeah he's on YEP
[5:59:43] wanblanco: so is Ambition currently beating Sheesh?
[5:59:45] CH1LL1E: @BumbaGlad we'll see what the official ruling is :)
[5:59:52] Simplypewpew: @TCGRebel the fact standss, you are wrong, they used the bug
[5:59:54] I_DoctorSatan_I: @PieceOfPanic It may be a boring game design for some, but, it's the best way to obtain gear other than Raid which is once a week where you can spam M+ to farm gear. PvP is better to farm and upgrade gear, but M+ is desireable for targeted gearing.
[5:59:54] TCGRebel: @MissAvantasia LUL
[6:00:02] Shearin77: @Sangura  yes
[6:00:06] boomie87: What’s wrong with Yep?
[6:00:11] MValta: @CH1LL1E Yeah we have seen that already :)
[6:00:11] sinlesssinner: NA kids get 24hrs head start in WF race, and they cry like no other when they lose :)
[6:00:11] Hellgaunt: @CH1LL1E I believe you. Just didn't see it cast.
[6:00:16] decodiaz: is that mage himelody with a different name or they actually playing with a different mage in SL?
[6:00:16] Khattnip: I like this format
[6:00:23] seteleechete: They need 40:06 to get second
[6:00:28] Shearin77: yep gave up after second day
[6:00:31] Tuuba: does the amount of volcanic go up with key level or something?
[6:00:44] Lepsylentil: @MissAvantasia So many grats to Echo tbh, they did great.
[6:00:44] bannad: @sinlesssinner 16 hours to beta test the raid
[6:00:46] FenrylSaylem: @Spexerino global aggro, snapping, snapping also existed in BfA
[6:00:57] Lyonidasx: @Tuuba with number of enemies afaik
[6:00:57] deimoskiri: maybe should've ressed Annie on proctor if playing safe now :S
[6:01:00] vaistios: @decodiaz melody played in another team, skyline is just the m+ team sponsored by skyline, I think melody played in team D
[6:01:00] Telestich: @Tuuba more volcanic when theres more enemies
[6:01:03] sinlesssinner: @bannad sure :)
[6:01:06] chunkychug: @Arilin MD wasnt even used... its called global threat.
[6:01:07] xCRUNKK: @tuuba  with how many mobs are infight
[6:01:11] Tuuba: ah
[6:01:13] Kolatroll: who won?
[6:01:20] decodiaz: @vaistios oh got it ty
[6:01:28] MissAvantasia: @lepsylentil I don't think anyone is truly surprised! ;)
[6:01:28] Tuuba: so just goes up with better groups then Kappa
[6:01:30] Celenoss: @Kolatroll echo
[6:01:31] I_DoctorSatan_I: @PieceOfPanic Well, atleast we get new dungeons and raid with the major patches.
[6:01:31] Rhiux: echo
[6:01:35] SoloRankedPlayerr: Echo
[6:01:38] bannad: @Kolatroll Echo
[6:01:38] sinlesssinner: MD has max range doesnt it?
[6:01:41] FENIXHAZE10: @chunkychug wowhead confirmed they dont have global agro
[6:01:45] Arilin: @Arilin The plagueborers don't trigger global threat
[6:01:46] Simplypewpew: @Arilin wromg  they used it at the start :) its just a fact
[6:01:47] ShenLongGame: ***
[6:01:48] xCRUNKK: @tuuba   haha yea LUL
[6:01:52] KxG26: Echo won with an asterisk
[6:01:52] CH1LL1E: @chunkychug md was absolutely used, check vods and dont spread lies
[6:01:52] Lepsylentil: @MissAvantasia Nooo, such an excellent team.
[6:01:52] Wastingmoney: MD wasnt used ..
[6:01:54] vaistios: @chunkychug might want to check wowhead, it tells you what happened so you dont spread misinformation
[6:01:58] rulzzs: YEp gave up?
[6:01:59] horsewithnooname: they should set sanguine afix that dungeon LUL
[6:01:59] Nupofur: It was NOT global threat. YumiTV explained it. It was a inifinit misdirect from the hunter. A BUG
[6:02:06] TCGRebel: @sinlesssinner it does, people dont realize that
[6:02:07] teirm13: @chunkychug it was in the beginning, when it expires or is canceled its permanent its a bug, otherwise the heal would get aggro, but the run is insane anyways
[6:02:12] sinlesssinner: @Arilin they do, they have threat just like regular mobs, so healing agro works
[6:02:23] vaistios: just check wowhead chat, there is an article on how it worked there
[6:02:25] seteleechete: Actually I counted wrong, they need 40:33 or less to get second
[6:02:31] boomie87: Why YEP team stopped playing?
[6:02:35] SeakerOpiDopi: ***
[6:02:37] vaistios: it is quite a cool tech
[6:02:37] seteleechete: 38:12 was for first
[6:02:41] FENIXHAZE10: the b u g, is like this: frag md leaves group and rejoin so infinite md
[6:02:43] sinlesssinner: @TCGRebel well ppl be baddies :)
[6:02:48] rixbur: Someone is writing post on wowhead that has some big missinformations, and is aimed against Echo.
[6:02:49] herr_nie: So wowhead is the only correct source or :'D
[6:02:50] LoL_F7: 38.12 was for 1st stop that
[6:02:57] oneifbyland: @seteleechete  that's still not right. they've already calculated it officially on the desk
[6:02:59] DrAko_11: @boomie87 they were so behind they gave up
[6:03:03] teirm13: @FENIXHAZE10 no just no
[6:03:05] TCGRebel: @sinlesssinner naaaah they just malding right now LUL
[6:03:06] greekttv: 38:12 was for beating echo
[6:03:10] Lepsylentil: @boomie87 they were far back enough they couldn't get above last, so opted to bow out.
[6:03:18] Nupofur: Just because it is on Wowhead, doesn't mean it isn't a bug guys. The admins just failed hard.
[6:03:18] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel “AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik “DoA” Lonnquist, Tristan “Dratnos” Killeen, Caroline “Naguura” Forer, Joseph “Psy” Prendergast, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton, and Alex “Xyronic” Tatge

[6:03:21] breekicheeki9: YEP
[6:03:26] KxG26: so  if its a bug then it shouldn't be counted right?
[6:03:29] seteleechete: @Astrraeus They calculated for 1st not 2nd
[6:03:29] Patrikhg: do u get coupons on pets in the ingame store ? Kappa
[6:03:29] LihizzXD: @greekttv No it wasnt. None can beat echo
[6:03:31] MissAvantasia: @savecentar what is written? 🤣

[6:03:52] Magymaster: 77 after day 2, couldn't recover
[6:03:56] Lyonidasx: @chatrider probably because they had no shot at winning anything anymore
[6:03:57] teirm13: @FENIXHAZE10 This bug is caused by the Irreführung expiring or being cancelled (by clicking off the buff), rather than being consumed normally when a mob is hit. ????
[6:03:57] boomie87: Ahhh ok thx @drako_11 @lepsylentil
[6:04:02] threedoorcoupe: Twitch chat sharing the same 2 braincells smh

[6:04:13] boxedfresh: The salt is incredible
[6:04:13] Nupofur: @kaizerg26 I shouldn't count. BUT the admins failed hard, let it go. So in that case, it is counted.
[6:04:15] oneifbyland: @seteleechete  so how many more different answers you gonna type in chat because you "miscounted" LUL
[6:04:17] JustLewlies: @UsedxSoul KEKW imagine using a terrible take and an overused trope while being wrong
[6:04:20] Magymaster: it is a misdirect bug, but it's been in the game since legion

[6:04:29] Insidieux: 10 second duration intended skills lasting forever is definitely intended clever mechanic chat shut up :)
[6:04:31] rixbur: Just make group, pull plagueborers and keep wiping and respawning, see what happends.
[6:04:32] Moobot: Find out more about the Great Push including tournament format in the viewer's guide: http://blizz.ly/TGPViewersGuide

[6:05:01] saltykim: @seteleechete you tried to tell them bro
[6:05:01] MValta: @Ultraaaxd not a bug :)
[6:05:01] jerrydacarry: Even being a bug, in order for it to be illegally exploited, Echo would have needed to know it was a bug and not intended
[6:05:03] breekicheeki9: UC berkeley graduate btw KEKW

[6:05:11] TheHornyGoat: the amount of coping in chat is unreal
[6:05:12] kinkshamin_: LUL
[6:05:13] TCGRebel: @GDmonger they didnt misdirect

[6:05:14] I_DoctorSatan_I: 5th grade math btw 4Head
[6:05:15] Magymaster: it's not snapping, it's misdirect
[6:05:16] FENIXHAZE10: @teirm13 no its about agro i dont really know, is just the md was infinite
[6:05:17] billabong212: @GDmonger its not perma MD who tf told you that

[6:05:34] tenooky: lol this is all so dumb none of this matters its not against the tourney rules
[6:05:37] kwizzzz: @GDmonger but it is, you are behind my friend
[6:05:41] aocAorus: Dont die Annie 4Head
[6:05:44] Nupofur: Better admins next time, that stops such bugs and runs and then it is all fine. Just better admins that understand what's going on
[6:05:45] Wastingmoney: @quiim a wrong fact KEKW
[6:05:46] tenooky: "bug" or not has nothing to do with it
[6:05:49] felpinky: If you try to discredict Echo's victory you are a m***n. The only one to blame is blizzard because they can't write code
[6:05:50] Insidieux: snapping is not a bug 100%. but Misdirect lasting forever when canceled the aura is 100% a bug :)
[6:05:52] FENIXHAZE10: i try to reply the strat in +2 IT DOESNT WORK something is sus
[6:05:52] vaistios: guys, a moderator and observer is watching at all times, even if it is a bug blizzard obviously allow it since no judgment was passed
[6:05:52] TCGRebel: @Reborn81 because they cant do it
[6:05:53] teirm13: @sinlesssinner @FENIXHAZE10 well i just want to get the facts straight, i dont care if its a bug or not echo played insane ^^
[6:05:53] Magnosh: @Drien0815 Just check the Vods, if a Hunter MD on you, you cancel it, and it keeps working forever instead of only for 30 seconds, then its a bug.
[6:05:54] FenrylSaylem: @jerrydacarry not really, iirc there was a common sense clause in the ruleset ^^
[6:05:57] Ultraaaxd: @Ultraaaxd But they used perma missdirect xd that is a bug , check wowhead you cannot snap without abusing this bug
[6:05:59] scuffedcaleb: Doa is such a great caster
[6:06:00] MissAvantasia: @gdmonger boohoo
[6:06:01] Gigabeartv: how is it a bug? all they're doing is using snapping, and that's not a bug, it was allowed in bfa, it was allowed in legion, and since it's still haven't been fixed or banned, it's allowed
[6:06:01] smashwow: you're in Warlords of Draenor. leave now.

[6:06:43] Magymaster: that doesn't look like a 2nd place
[6:06:44] JustLewlies: Anyone who thinks Echo cheated -- A) Doesn't know the game B) Doesn't know that blizzard was watching the ENTIRE time.. and would have stopped it if deemed "Illegal"... so C) Stop drinking salt.

[6:06:54] jerrydacarry: @FenrylSaylem except this bug is 100% not common sense, it just seems like another snap + misdirect
[6:06:56] blutixd: @Insidieux its not misdirect everyone gets in combat when they get pulled so they snap to the healer or tank that gets aggro from healing
[6:06:58] happycakee: time to ban echo

[6:07:05] MrKentKiller: @MissQ37 how did they hide it? They literally streamed all of it for 5hrs LUL
[6:07:05] Arilin: @The_Red__Queen they hid the bug with hiding UI though? and it was a known bug, against rules
[6:07:11] TCGRebel: @UsedxSoul mad?

[6:07:13] RiSKxVeNoMz: @the_red__queen what do you think about it?
[6:07:14] Nupofur: @Magnosh Dude, I'm on your side. It was a bug used from ECHO. I said, that the Admins should've known that it was a bug and stopped the run.
[6:07:16] gaminggoblin: yes

[6:09:40] Reedie: @JanDeGrote1 dont worry, I was cheering for Echo, its just sad they used a bug instead
[6:09:42] Penkek: @Finkl_ its not global combat it requires infinite MD
[6:09:43] kanaqtx: echo asked the admins if it was okay to use that strat and blizzard approved so please stop malding
[6:09:44] Insidieux: they dont have global combat :) they instantly aggro to tank because hunter has bugged MD buff that lasts even out of dungeon
[6:09:44] Nupofur: @kotakekw Don't start this again xD It was a bug with MD. Just look up Wowhead.
[6:09:48] EzzLyfe: @kotakekw it is a miss direction bug. It happens when you use it, then cancel it. It remains on you globally. Other teams also replicated it and confirmed its a bug

[6:10:18] Grortraugh: Pool was small, yeah
[6:10:23] pseudo_nathan: Nice Hunter MC bug abuse win :/
[6:10:23] MikoAoi: Actually if echo got 27 PF timed using the normal strategy, they are still no.1 because they have shorter SD time.
[6:10:24] excessior: clever use of mechanics
[6:10:25] Finkl_: @Finkl_ exactly, but people keep talking about global combat for some wierd reason
[6:10:26] Foreverodd10: Sick event! Was so exciting to watch at the end, GGs!
[6:10:27] Nupofur: YEP ff after second day.
[6:10:32] Penkek: @shieldz__ check wowhead for a explanation how in this instance it is a bug on Misdirect
[6:10:32] horsewithnooname: Wheres Frag?
[6:10:35] Crazyhealer1: Great push > mdi
[6:10:37] MrKentKiller: @pseudo_nathan mad?
[6:10:40] EzzLyfe: @penkek I agree, I dont think admins knew it was a bug at the time it happened
[6:10:40] Insidieux: i guess mages buffing their pyros out of arena and getting infinite buffs werent a bug either just clever use :)

[6:11:13] UltraSpinach: Probably there should be investigation with devs :(
[6:11:18] galinhoo: Blizzard would never touch their rank 1 team
[6:11:20] shieldz__: @penkek they dont use MD for that brother
[6:11:21] kevinfly33: echo won !Lets bug warcraft!
[6:11:23] Penkek: @EzzLyfe I think they asked, hey can we snap them in this dung? They said yes, but then didnt realize it requires doing the Misdirect bug, or didn't include it
[6:11:23] Sparklefartz: oh wow echo won ||,|
[6:11:23] RiSKxVeNoMz: @mikoaoi this is what people dont understand, and with the quality of echo it's a safe assumption they would have had it timed
[6:11:26] pseudo_nathan: @pseudo_nathan Hmm I think its just not great for the competition... Impressive execution tho
[6:11:27] levkao: bug
[6:11:29] sinclsw23: some of those kills were mad close
[6:11:30] flem_wow: permanent misdirect abused to win tournament smile
[6:11:33] imexalted1: Max was right
[6:11:34] Rulem: its clearly an unintended bug; MD before the start, close and open UI, and then it stays up permanently?
[6:11:34] insomniavix: @adamkfc ambiton isnt rank 1 anymore justaces team is rio rank 1 now
[6:11:36] hathor_: a method of playing the game in a way not intended by the game developers to gain an advantage over other players. Go read the wowhead article, they cheated to win.
[6:11:36] DonAlberot: Ellesmere is about to start crying, this is so funny
[6:11:39] excessior: they will fix it on live
[6:11:41] Penkek: @shieldz__ Check wowhead, newest post, fully explains it

[6:11:44] Alyza27: chat BabyRage
[6:11:45] adamkfc: isnot bug. its like ATAL DAZER the snap's also others teams they know that

[6:11:58] boomie87: Eel
[6:11:59] EzzLyfe: I think we need a statement from the admins in the coming days.
[6:12:01] atpx486: just hide the bug to win LUL
[6:12:02] Helios_KS: snapping mechanic was existing and will exist just get over it ppl

[6:12:09] keijinihon: snapping they doing since BFA.... stop crying
[6:12:14] EzzLyfe: Oh we will 100% get a hotfix for the NOT BUG that Echo were using.
[6:12:15] flem_wow: @Beerhog not sure if meme but it's not the snapping, it's aura canceling the MD that makes it permanent and allows the borer delivery system
[6:12:19] baseboned: you don't think echo could have won without that? like spellstealing a fungalmancer is too hard for them? you absolute walnuts
[6:12:22] MissAvantasia: I really love this format!

[6:12:28] mikkeal0: To do the newest Highest keys bugs have always been used. If the admins watching them for 5 hours dont stop it straight away its clear its okay
[6:12:29] greenay11: @finkl_ imagine @ing yourself to seem like someone agrees with you
[6:12:32] Malicone: Cpngratulations to Echo!!! should be not with 2 !! :p
[6:12:32] Thyrox4ever: Fragnance s probably the best multiclass dps in the game.
[6:12:34] knightswithkiera: yea this format was great
[6:12:36] EzzLyfe: @keijinihon its not about snapping, its about infinite misdirection bug
[6:12:39] Kahlandra: thanks everyone!
[6:12:46] boomie87: Ellesmere stop crying dude we all knows that Echo gonna win!
[6:12:46] Rulem: @Helios27 its not snapping thats the issue... it a permanent misdirect from a bug
[6:12:47] EzzLyfe: @zaxii2807 where can I find it?
[6:12:48] Insidieux: chat stop saying its only snapping. its more THAN snapping
[6:12:48] galinhoo: @keijinihon it isnt about the snap, he had infinite MD to do that (you can check on the clips)
[6:12:49] Tussep: @Helios27 People are talking about an infinite MD bug, it's not about snapping

[6:19:36] brian99000: ***
[6:19:38] Knoppel: @Leeroypaxton echo won the whole thing like the whole thing is over
[6:19:46] Yasractcha: AYAYA
[6:19:55] JanDeGrote1: @Prophet001 if it was a cheat blizzard would have banned them :)
[6:19:57] TCGRebel: @jhoan930824 clever use of game mechanics
[6:19:59] horsewithnooname: Kiddos, mom calling to bed.
[6:20:04] demazLol: Echo was winning this thing even if they didnt time the 28 lol
[6:20:05] brocceli: win is a win. but echo knows they had unfair advantage
[6:20:09] FENIXHAZE10: im echo fan but that was cheese
[6:20:16] Prophet001: @JanDeGrote1 give it some time :)
[6:20:20] waraijhoan: Echo use a BUG look at Wowhead!
[6:20:31] FENIXHAZE10: sky would win by points
[6:20:31] Noheirlooms: @FENIXHAZE10 No you are not, and no it wasnt
[6:20:31] Prophet001: i like echo too... well i did but that was cheese
[6:20:32] demazLol: @FENIXHAZE10  Every single team couldve used it
[6:20:37] waraijhoan: that is not game mechancs, its a bug
[6:20:38] TCGRebel: @jhoan930824 it isnt a blue post, its irrelevant
[6:20:43] demazLol: they just didnt know how to do it correctly
[6:20:46] xPhlair: we will see what blizzard does otherwise gg echo for now
[6:20:48] liberategeorge: Wasn't Echo winning on time without the 28?
[6:20:52] JanDeGrote1: @Prophet001 there was an admin watching them the whole time he would have odne something but you keep waiting
[6:20:53] jundarer: They didn't even need the 28 to win, they would have won anyways
[6:20:53] yf1233: Team BUG No.1
[6:20:56] Merami: Win is a win, and that’s some big brain play allowed by blizzard but after all it is still a utilization of bug. So either way.
[6:20:57] ジェーり: when will it start?
[6:20:58] NotJane_: Its not a bug its called snapping. It was implemented in Legion to prevent mobs from evading
[6:21:06] jeevel: Echo was bug abusing btw
[6:21:09] Prophet001: @JanDeGrote1 cheese :)
[6:21:23] lirly__: hiding ui to apply explouts, monkas
[6:21:30] demazLol: Lol the funny part is everyone saw Echo use the cheese IF they wanted to use the cheese EVERY single team couldve
[6:21:33] brian99000: it wasn't snapping @NotJane_ it was a bug related to misdirect
[6:21:36] oneifbyland: @demazLol  it's clearly a bug... it's a matter of whether Blizzard told them they could use it or not. If not, that's a problem. If yes, you're absolutely right
[6:21:37] JanDeGrote1: In the end Skyline did not even finish the SD fast enough so Echo would still have won just a FYI for all salty boys
[6:21:39] aloken1312: @jeevel sure bud, if they were the admin watching them would have stopped them insta, but copium
[6:21:42] UpadlySzczurr: @NotJane_ they are not complainging about snapping but a MD bug ;p
[6:21:42] FENIXHAZE10: @demazlol problem is not just a doable strat yummi confirmed they drop the strat because they couldnt do the infinite md always
[6:21:43] Merami: It’s a combination of snapping and MD bug what’s so hard to understand?
[6:21:45] chronoswow: Win is a win, stay mald NA fanboy
[6:21:46] Prophet001: @NotJane_ that's not what the issue is the issue is his hiding his UI to bug MD and getting permanent aggro so he could snap
[6:21:55] dgjns: 100% it will be hotfixed
[6:21:56] straighttokes420: @NotJane_ not about the snap its about the md timer being broken
[6:22:00] Prophet001: @chronoswow no honor
[6:22:17] JanDeGrote1: @Prophet001 In the end Skyline did not even finish the SD fast enough so Echo would still have won just a FYI for all salty boys
[6:22:18] Umulium_81: hiding ui and using big mount to hide something. they clearly cheated
[6:22:22] FENIXHAZE10: aswell i tried on +2 and they lose agro didnt snap to tank
[6:22:24] Demartan: blizzard already tweeted out the win forsenLUL
[6:22:28] demazLol: Growl's team tried it and couldnt pull it off
[6:22:29] MissQ37: @notjane the snapping isn't the issue, the issue is the MD bug which is not allowed.  The snapping only worked because of the MD bug
[6:22:34] Merami: Why do people have to be”salty NA fanboy” in order to state this is a bug?
[6:22:36] chronoswow: @prophet001 do you ever see siege of boralus strat ?
[6:22:41] redalchemistrain: lol
[6:22:41] TCGRebel: no misdirect was used k thnx come again
[6:22:46] demazLol: Blizzard tweeted out the win which means there was nothing wrong with it
[6:22:59] RaccoonJS: 😛
[6:23:02] chronoswow: True
[6:23:08] NotJane_: didnt know u can MD some1 that is 10 miles away LUL
[6:23:08] JanDeGrote1: @Merami Because the bug doesnt matter even with a +27 pf echo would have won so it is legit a pointless discussion
[6:23:14] RaccoonJS: Who won chat
[6:23:22] flexor4: ***, they didnt hide it , just stop now
[6:23:26] daiger5o: yo limit max i know u are here. show urself
[6:23:26] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel “AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik “DoA” Lonnquist, Tristan “Dratnos” Killeen, Caroline “Naguura” Forer, Joseph “Psy” Prendergast, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton, and Alex “Xyronic” Tatge
[6:23:30] Prophet001: no respect for cheating Method err echo.. sorry echo
[6:23:31] Tubefrog: the memes won
[6:23:33] TCGRebel: @NotJane_ they are all hunters, they know everything Kappa
[6:23:41] CoolChuckKory: is it over?
[6:23:46] FENIXHAZE10: they do miss direction check wowhead
[6:23:50] Umulium_81: skyline won in my mind :)
[6:24:02] NotJane_: i love how ppl pretend to know everything. MD wasnt used it was FD. Those mobs have a global agro range which means they go to some1 else which is zaelia for healing agro.
[6:24:04] JanDeGrote1: @Prophet001 You are just daft m8 even without the +28 pf Echo would have won
[6:24:09] Kellami: Max was spot on
[6:24:14] TCGRebel: @FENIXHAZE10 not a blue post, it doesnt matter
[6:24:28] Hayo_oyaH: @NotJane_ have u read the wowhead article?
[6:24:35] Thregenbeck: @NotJane_ try again, they bugged MD to be permanently up at the start of the runs
[6:24:35] Moobot: More information on player Gear / Talents / Build can be found on Raider.IO: http://rio.gg/greatpushleaderblz
[6:24:35] laiiro: what heppend to YEP ?
[6:24:44] Arkshol: People still malding KEKW
[6:24:44] MissQ37: @notjane, look it up on wowhead.  The hunter had a perma MD the whole run.  They wouldn't wanted to have had the mobs snap to anyone other then the tank.  And they hid their UI so people wouldn't see.
[6:24:46] NotJane_: @NintendoNeedsNewIPs yes and its wrong
[6:24:47] sukmybullets: bombed
[6:24:51] Demartan: @laiiro yep gave up Sadge
[6:24:53] Flipp5gg: I wish trade chat would be like this these days LULW
[6:25:08] TCGRebel: @NotJane_ maybe one day they will learn the difference between misdirect and game mechanics
[6:25:09] FENIXHAZE10: @notjane_ wowhead and i can confirm they dont have global agro i just try on a +2 they didnt snap to tank without md
[6:25:11] Merami: @jandegrote1 Echo winning this or not is not the problem and I support them anyways, them winning the tournament without the bug has nothing to do with the fact that they are using the bug. The problem is why is blizzard allowing a utilization of a Md bug.
[6:25:21] horsewithnooname: @MissQ37 Sneak
[6:25:27] Hayo_oyaH: @NotJane_ why couldn't it be both MD and FD?
[6:25:50] SpiffTV: !rules
