[1:46:11] Faedrik: @Slizzzard What are you talking about? He has never had a facecam.
[1:46:15] CringeK: Thaat just means he hit the wall sooner, doesn't change the fact that the wall exists
[1:46:17] Mertauh: lots of people are bored its not just streamers

[1:46:32] RockonBrother88: phase 3 only 10 levels gonna be worse
[1:46:33] morphyck: The #1 reason interest is down, is because GDKPs were banned. Change my mind.
[1:46:34] Dunpeel: dude im on my 4th alt
[1:46:35] Insie71: worried for P3 because it feels like the middle brother of end point talents + mounts and level 60 content
[1:46:35] Dunpeel: kill me

[1:47:41] monorideadge: KEKW

[1:48:48] graduenz: phase 1 was popular because of blizzcon
[1:48:51] lucasarino1: Rofl, GDKP and just another phase. Just play and smile, mke something other interactions in your life, and stop shittling about the game. Play another game if youre down mate

[2:00:41] NotTheWheel: @Shredmuffn I think those things are fun but you'd be grinding rep regardless which really just leaves the achievements. (Though MoP added pet battles - I unironically like that)
[2:00:53] InsolentWhelp: thats how I feel about streams sometimes
[2:00:55] radassbadass69: shorts save whatever audio level your last watched video was at. It's incredibly fucking annoying chinese tier design

[2:11:55] coolcrazyguy72: what is staysafe doing?
[2:11:56] rsSilence: Apologizing to a murderer because you're afraid of political backlash from literal communists. Very unify, much compassion. Wow.

[2:12:55] kingdulli: illegals gtfo
[2:13:03] malingonium: The idea of exploring a hostile, vast world is what got me into wow all those years ago
[2:13:05] Fuzzywuggums: zoneman?
[2:13:06] kingdulli: @castle_milk no they’re still illegal..
[2:13:09] NotTheWheel: Well it's not just crossing the border. You shouldn't be able to get property, buy a car... so somehow you're doing that illegally.
[2:13:14] pariahrip: :(
[2:13:20] radassbadass69: if I overstay a visa it makes me an illegal elsewhere, really weird that the wording matters so much when the truth should just be the truth
[2:13:23] castle_milk: @kingdulli but still get in...
[2:13:30] numblezzz: im fine with illegals as long as its mostly women and children (no fatties)
[2:13:35] joh_gaming: @soulstone the priest
[2:13:39] Nathalas95: it's really weird how liberals are pro illegal immigration now, a few years ago we all agreed it was bad
[2:13:43] kingdulli: @castle_milk still breaking the law despite the current administration not enforcing said law
[2:13:53] Mawshaw: Nerdge You didn't go meta form to take 1 extra auto and move 3 more yards
[2:13:57] DankWizard420: the vast majority of "illegals" are visa overstayers not the border hoppers in the mind of KKona s YEP
[2:13:57] lagginginironforge: big booty latina visas?

[2:14:39] TurboBased: "affirming care"
[2:14:39] NotTheWheel: memeism
[2:14:41] rsSilence: It's the whole premise of Newspeak in 1984, remove the ability to even think of disagreeing with the government because they literally lack the vocabulary to do so.
[2:14:43] funkyzied: words are spells
[2:14:48] radassbadass69: the unhoused

[2:15:25] avoidedneXt: On the internet maybe
[2:15:29] liceol: perchance
[2:15:29] avoidedneXt: but in real life its much different
[2:15:32] numblezzz: i would prefer local girls over big booty latinas if they werent mostly communists that support giving hormones to kids
[2:15:33] NotTheWheel: D:
[2:15:35] malingonium: Are you going to try and fish from the nelf treehouse hugbox city for the epic memes, by the way?
[2:15:36] numblezzz: but ofc i live in seattle
[2:15:39] Labrinthgg: i feel like a lot of rap nowadays is a little mind controlling, the 808 beats some are very hhypnotizing its weird.

[2:15:58] uglev2808: what do you think about lgbt people
[2:16:07] Gabe4D: @staysafetv regardless of your overarching opinion on Israel/Palestine, do you believe it is accurate to describe it as a genocide?
[2:16:08] finngrumbles: schizo's band together

[2:17:29] Vallun: attention farming @Gabe4D 😠
[2:17:30] NotTheWheel: yep
[2:17:33] zakkoncrak: 100% a genocide lol
[2:17:42] mortis_1: soo WW2?
[2:17:45] avoidedneXt: Most genocides are based on class, who could have predicted?
[2:17:45] coolcrazyguy72: you should do more research behind schizophrenia…do you think I like hearing voices and coming to insane conclusions to what’s right and wrong. no hate I’m just saying it’s out of our control mostly

[2:18:06] Bronloch: NO BUT THEY DO WANT THEM GONE! LUL
[2:18:07] lagginginironforge: why would they give civilians aid
[2:18:10] bench_guy: No
[2:18:12] Gabe4D: I think they want every single palestinian to assimilate or leave at this point, and if neither, then probably dead
[2:18:13] lagginginironforge: if they wanted to kill them all
[2:18:14] mr_tateo: they have troops there
[2:18:21] keugnu: "if a person has a penis, you know very well, he's a man"
[2:18:24] rsSilence: If you take Netanyahu's "Amelek" comments at face value, then you could argue yes.
[2:18:29] verrack714: the numbers say yes
[2:18:33] avoidedneXt: i would argue that 99.98% of all genocides are the controlling class killing the poors
[2:18:37] bigkuntey: I dont think israel got a single opinion
[2:18:37] finngrumbles: casual genocide, leave some behind
[2:18:41] numblezzz: as someone that dislikes israel, israel has gone out of its way to prevent the deaths of civilians. but they must destroy a faction that uses its civilians as a shield
[2:18:44] eWreck36: eWreck36 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months, currently on a 48 month streak! good evenin

[2:19:12] graduenz: problem solved for them
[2:19:15] manthyx: i hink they would just kick themn
[2:19:15] crude_prototype: they would deport them all if they could
[2:19:21] NotTheWheel: All they'd be doing is what the palestinians want to do to them
[2:19:27] DankWizard420: israeli life would be easier but less ..practical probably
[2:19:28] johnnyhopkinwead1: why are you doing this?
[2:19:38] bench_guy: O one else will take pall
[2:19:47] numblezzz: meanwhile america carpet bombed and firebombed germany and japan for the sake of destroying "evil" factions
[2:19:50] graduenz: I think if ww3 explodes, the will erase gaza asap
[2:19:51] Metaphix: i think it's more about them wanting palestinians to not be a problem anymore or go somewhere else but that aint happening
[2:19:58] avoidedneXt: things like race, ethnicity, religioin and creed no longer matter when someone has the same amount of wealth as you
[2:20:00] eWreck36: what are yall doing
[2:20:00] morphyck: What are you even doing rn ??
[2:20:02] numblezzz: atleast germany and japan didnt use human shields in WW2, unlike hamas
[2:20:08] Nappycans: hey yall. just wanted to stop in and say hi real quick. wife and I are cooking dinner so can’t stay. have a great stream and see you next week. :)
[2:20:08] avoidedneXt: no
[2:20:10] finngrumbles: yes
[2:20:18] finngrumbles: true
[2:20:33] numblezzz: they have deliberately avoided civilian death. compare that to allied forces in ww2
[2:20:42] kingdulli: how else do you defeat hamas?
[2:20:50] numblezzz: hamas used human shields. its on them
[2:20:55] bench_guy: No one else will take Pallistine refugees
[2:21:01] 14forever: what are you doing
[2:21:01] DankWizard420: I too think genocidal factions warn them first YEP
[2:21:02] lagginginironforge: Thats the typical response from civilians affected by wars
[2:21:08] Polerize: the numbers of dead would be a lot higher if they werent trying to avoid it
[2:21:08] Hou53r2: you can jump up that pole to get to hyjal
[2:21:09] uglev2808: That was literally the argument i used at our discussion on the topic here at my uni in Taiwan lol
[2:21:09] hystelios: What could he possibly be doing out here Susge
[2:21:13] 14forever: balls
[2:21:18] verrack714: isreal will keep some shabbos goys around for things like keeping their string tied around entire cities so they can trick their god
[2:21:19] hystelios: Selling summon probably Kappa
[2:21:25] rsSilence: @numblezzz Bank robbers use human shields, that doesn't mean the police get to just shoot the hostages because they're in the weay.
[2:21:27] rsSilence: way*
[2:21:28] AlphaSimply: KEKW
[2:21:32] graduenz: @numblezzz they are not shooting them, how can you survive there with nothing to produce?
[2:21:33] johnnyhopkinwead1: Peggers
[2:21:34] hxyfever: Peggers
[2:21:35] Shredmuffn: muslim countries got walls not letting them in LUL USA bad tho
[2:22:00] numblezzz: @rsSilence bank robbery isnt war. when a war MUST be conducted to save protect the people of a nation, the user of human shields is at fault
[2:22:01] kappanostra: middle east killing each other like they have done since time immemorial, what else is new, chances are they forgot what the initial conflict was about
[2:22:05] Metaphix: recon drone Pog
[2:22:11] bench_guy: Isreal is protecting its country
[2:22:14] numblezzz: even the geneva conventions blame the deaths of human shields on the user
[2:22:21] JewRhinos: @bench_guy hmm I wonder why, I wonder if there are some historical examples of why possibly
[2:22:24] kingdulli: @shredmuffn remember every country can have a secure border except the USA. we need all the foreigners you don’t understand!!!
[2:22:34] uglev2808: Who's America's biggest adversary? Russia, China, Iran, someone else or all of the mentioned?

[2:22:55] johnnyhopkinwead1: staysafe why do bones pop and crack more the older you get
[2:23:01] numblezzz: i dislike israel and palestine. let them kill eachother over the shit hole desert. but israel is 100% in the right in this conflict
[2:23:01] weouthere365: they should take each other out simultaneously
[2:23:09] QuestFor420: yep

[2:23:53] NotTheWheel: if yall had a fast food chain what would be your gimmick?
[2:23:58] Gabe4D: @staysafetv you could actually argue that genocide is the only way to completely establish control of a region long term. Like we sorta committed genocide against native americans in order to establish and maintain control of the US lol
[2:24:05] QuestFor420: hahahhaha fuckyouu
[2:24:21] numblezzz: @Gabe4D i think a better comparison is ww2. we obliterated german and japanese cities
[2:24:27] Shredmuffn: male orc EZ
[2:24:35] DankWizard420: @Gabe4D you cant in this day and age (you couldnt even in history really) guarantee 100% effectiveness though
[2:24:46] CookieClickerLegend: 3:3 Pog
[2:24:59] jvgalanj94: LOL
[2:25:06] liceol: multiculturalism is genocide
[2:25:10] CookieClickerLegend: LOL

[6:13:47] TheEndIsNear777: re-release (cata)* and Retail ain't it*
[6:13:51] SuperLost89: i think we will get new stuff at 60
[6:13:53] Gish3: They probably will put more money into SoD/ + after Cata flops
[6:13:54] SupreemLeeder11: what server is this?
[6:13:57] cuties_tw: @Chainluck no one care about balance its fun to do anyway
[6:14:12] radassbadass69: no mounts
[6:14:15] Steebadin: @Chainluck Why does it need to be balanced
[6:14:22] Balkazare: The cost to run the servers is more than the amount made from subs alone, so yea they would need cosmetics or a wow token
[6:14:23] osopolar1977: send eye to the Cave
[6:14:33] Chainluck: @cuties_tw There wont be literally ANY competent arena if the balance continues like that. But ye for sure if people want it just for "fun"
[6:14:33] radassbadass69: bring back /spit if there's gonna be cosmetics
[6:14:36] Magalampe: If more cosmetics = more content we are all here for it
[6:14:44] arcantio123: this is in the dwarf gnome intro cinematic
