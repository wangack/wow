[2:04:25] Lexuh7: #showtooltip /cancelaura Guarded by the Light /cast [target=mouseover,help,exists]Holy Light; [help]Holy Light; [target=player] Holy Light maybe?
[2:04:30] Deadge_Gartic: yeah weird
[2:04:32] Deadge_Gartic: it should work
[2:04:34] colejr27: what if u used the spell id not the actually name
[2:04:36] thebigdongerhere: They want u to heal less bruv
[2:04:38] thefoxborough69: Just click it sadgeweird SmokeTime every time
[2:04:52] Lucons1: einstein pulled up
[2:05:12] Deadge_Gartic: click isnt solution tbh

[2:05:21] thefoxborough69: git gud SKILLISSUE sadgeweird SmokeTime
[2:05:22] Deadge_Gartic: you might accidentally delete something usefull too
[2:05:30] salibazap: that's the minigame, press heal and you have untill you cast to rightclick
[2:05:41] Lucons1: for me it works when i disable itemrack idk why
[2:05:55] Deadge_Gartic: cancel aura should work idk why it is bugging out
[2:05:59] salibazap: hahaha once i rightclicked bubled man
[2:06:00] salibazap: was fucked
[2:06:02] colejr27: @Savix try /cancelaura spell id 415059
[2:06:09] crazedrogue001: @Savix are u able to beat arcane mage in duel
[2:06:13] thebigdongerhere: Might what ?
[2:06:15] SlLVER_FOX: Does it have an other spell id/name associated with it? Like connected to something else?
[2:06:20] Deadge_Gartic: make it a seperate buton
[2:06:22] Denat0: how long have you been waiting in queue?
[2:06:25] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix make it a seperate button
[2:06:30] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix just to cancel aura
[2:06:31] jtstroud: savix
[2:06:32] Deadge_Gartic: maybe that works
[2:06:34] RudyRube: @Savix you can get elkanobuffbars or similar and set a bar to just show that buff (and click off).  like center of screen or something
[2:06:41] jtstroud: hi <3
[2:06:46] Lucons1: can u remove it in combat at all_
[2:06:47] thebigdongerhere: Maybe is ur monitor savix
[2:06:57] thefoxborough69: Glasses are seen as a sign of intelligence peepoNerd
[2:06:58] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix try making a seperate button sir just for cancel aura
[2:07:00] Deadge_Gartic: that might fix it
[2:07:07] funboix0x0: Get Mr Magoo monitor
[2:07:13] crazedrogue001: whats with this scuffed Q
[2:07:20] jorsephus: do you wear glasses savix?
[2:07:30] thebigdongerhere: Premade maybe thats wgy
[2:07:30] Selecktt: If you want to use ID to cancel, you need to use a script in place of cancel aura, not a macro. Cant do it in macro.  /script for i=1,40 do local _,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,s=UnitBuff("player",i) if s==415059 then CancelUnitBuff("player",i) break end end
[2:07:34] Deadge_Gartic: it might

[2:07:49] niveous_a: FlowerCatJAM
[2:07:52] Deadge_Gartic: i mean i just cant see a reason why it shouldnt work
[2:07:56] salibazap: Usually with make, leaving combat/entering combat make it works sometimes. But it's bugged, i think there's nothing we can do besides waiting.
[2:07:57] Cosroka: How are you Savix?
[2:08:01] thefoxborough69: Gartic
[2:08:02] BlueNeoh: Bro has needed glasses for months now and just let his eyes deteriorate instead of wearing them savixStare
[2:08:08] salibazap: I dont even know if this is intended
[2:08:09] kagiyama_h: poor pals can't make macros, meanwhile boomkins are like 90s hackers with pages of macros when all they really have to do is press 1 button.
[2:08:18] BlueNeoh: Soon he won't even be able to read chat Sadge om
[2:08:23] Deadge_Gartic: just weird
[2:08:27] funboix0x0: Can you cancel mount?
[2:08:34] tummboi: Jamgie i wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
[2:08:34] Byshash: @kagiyama_h the macro doesnt work
[2:08:39] Deadge_Gartic: yeah yeah i know sir
[2:08:40] nuffedpips: i can make macros chat COPIUM
[2:08:45] Denat0: bro i don't know if it'll help but queuing as 5 or less will require less time to find a BG.
[2:08:45] averagekills: Hows paladin been so far in p2 savix??? I'm getting a late start and going to start leveling later today!
[2:08:48] Deadge_Gartic: i'm just shocked
