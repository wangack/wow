[3:29:38] bob_the_demon: Are there official HC servers or just on honor only?
[3:29:50] net_mi: Mandalorian was overhyped
[3:29:58] ClassicMalcontent: That's as Disney is pulling it from the creator and making it more meandering nonsense to milk the Mandalorian.
[3:30:15] Rudric_Ice: Star wars universe is overrated
[3:30:48] ClassicMalcontent: Yes Mando S3 is Disney killing the 'golden cow' by dictating some fluffy BS plotline (Grogu was still supposed to be training not returned per original plotline)
[3:31:02] spencer_zero: Man, the music from WoD was so damn good.
[3:31:02] ClassicMalcontent: Disney is Effing it up.
[3:31:15] ronny_84: Mando series peaked already when grogu went with luke
[3:31:22] PvtHudson093: you can see the studio interference
[3:31:28] ClassicMalcontent: Then "look at all the celeb cameos'
[3:31:42] ronny_84: but then they ruined the reunion by doing it on a different show
[3:31:45] ClassicMalcontent: Grogu was STILL supposed to be with Luke.
[3:32:01] abracka_: bill burr in the mando caught me off guard completely
[3:32:02] spencer_zero: Star Wars is just the Thrawn Waiting Room for me at this point.

[4:46:52] Chibs243: Have a look on wow reddit
[4:46:53] Zivs: @Sollice an employee was talking about how they are struggling with people leaving and having to prio certain things
[4:46:57] abracka_: not short staffed, but a producer on wow went off yesterday
[4:46:58] mavericks312: blizz is far from short staffed wtf
[4:47:01] Shugaze: ya makes no sense
[4:47:01] Sollice: OH thats your problem
[4:47:04] Chibs243: Seen the tweet there
[4:47:04] Sollice: WoW reddit
[4:47:05] n0tl0wHS: maybe they mean their staff is short
[4:47:06] cabalish: cabalish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 72 months! 6 Years of grinding for LOVE towLove
[4:47:08] DecayedmiNt: Twitter and reddit arent reliable sources
[4:47:11] abracka_: they're hemorrhaging people left and right
[4:47:13] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @zildrog (warning)
[4:47:15] Cello_73: @Chibs243 dont believe everything you read bud

[4:47:18] Derca_: reddit... KEKW
[4:47:24] sinidas51: What do you think of Semi Hardcore Server Towelliee?
[4:47:25] abracka_: well the person on twitter is a producer for wow, so
[4:47:27] abracka_: pretty reliable lol
[4:47:29] Zivs: The source isn't reddit it's just where they shared the tweet lol
[4:47:31] Shugaze: reddit source 🤓
[4:47:43] Intrus18: Not only that, new content for overwatch, new games coming out too, diablo 4, diablo3 recent season release....
[4:47:46] PhillyDilly18: semi-hardcore server = softcore?
[4:48:01] Sollice: I am a source-----Blizzard at an all time high in developers. Going on a tear with new content across all live service games
[4:48:07] Chibs243: Talks about having to make decisions on what features they can work on for df
[4:48:07] Sollice: See how that works :P
[4:48:19] Broomba: a belllular video says wow staff is cut
[4:48:21] Shugaze: now I heard rumors that blizz team met with the HC community leads
[4:48:29] Zivs: @Sollice you can make fun of people but the guy actually working on the game disagrees
[4:48:33] DecayedmiNt: Blizzard occasionally gets rid of CS staff, but thats for multiple of reasons.
[4:48:39] mavericks312: @Chibs243 again why are you listening to reddit and twitter lol
[4:48:48] sinidas51: Semi Hardcore=   Drop gear on corpse with 24 hours to retrieve or it dissappears, and heavy exp penalty
[4:48:48] ObsidianHealer: @PhillyDilly18 That would be a PVE server I guess? That way you could never flag and its only mobs and plays that train mobs into you that could kill you.

[4:51:00] bennyuz2: a crisis map just a buisness term for a project thats way off schedule

[4:52:20] mavericks312: does it say what team it is
[4:52:22] PhantomX_Destiny: @Towelliee Do you think there is a huge crossover of Wow and D4 players?
[4:52:33] Sollice: Chosing what content to deliver at certain times is normal process.....I am sure they always have more in the pike they want to get out
[4:53:08] DecayedmiNt: People really gotta realize the gaming industry is highly volatile too, Hell, a lot of it is contract work
[4:53:20] mavericks312: reddit is a cesspool
[4:53:23] freetherocktv: Reddit will always fucking reddit
[4:53:40] PadidinJones: sadge
[4:53:52] Nyytro84: Same reason Ghostcrawler left Riot, the forced return to office is a short sighted business stratgey and people are like nope
[4:53:53] drmabusee: dont know why wfh is such a big issue
[4:53:57] freetherocktv: gaming circle jerks that sub needs to banned forever

[4:54:23] drmabusee: reddit is full of doomers i feel
[4:54:29] Chibs243: The thread talks about relatively low wages at blizz and high cost of living in Irvine. Reduced working from home maybe part of the cause
[4:54:40] GroovyBryan: They talking about Bobby?
[4:55:02] Nyytro84: the tweet is referring to Mike Ybarra
[4:55:03] Mecabeast: Slower hit harder
[4:55:17] Dr_ShockLoL: human racial also remember that, works with swords and maces
[4:55:21] abracka_: the one of us mentality gotta stop

[4:55:54] Zivs: @abracka_ kinda agree, he still has to make the business decisions
[4:56:00] freetherocktv: @Chibs243 high cost of living is a whole state issue not just Blizzard. Not defending them at all, but I have family in the SF/Bay Area and its horrible what the cities are doing and landlords
[4:56:19] Nyytro84: its mostly the return to the office, it doesnt make any sense to make people return and they are leaving because of it
[4:57:03] smashwow: towel was on the floor room spinning after that shit LUL
[4:57:09] freetherocktv: @Nyytro84 how does it not make any sense? There is office space to be filled and its been proven that not every person can work from home productively
[4:57:09] ArcaneSyntax: I mean it makes complete sense, they have a huge campus that's empty
[4:57:32] PadidinJones: word
[4:57:38] jsb5047: ^
[4:57:39] freetherocktv: @Towelliee there are also lots of LAZY FUCKS that work from home and make companies not want to do it anymore
[4:57:43] irWaffle: Theyre still paying for the office space, they want people in there
[4:57:48] Nyytro84: @freetherocktv if they cant be trusted to work from home then they shouldnt havea job lol
[4:57:50] SlowMoJoe_TV: for sure, my company went WFH 2 years ago and we have had record profits

[4:58:13] 3ll3nwood: i mean you're working from home right now, and look at you!
[4:58:21] Shugaze: going to the office and being forced to small talk
[4:58:24] SmallzzIV: @freetherocktv a lot of insecure bosses as well that want to look over shoulders
[4:58:26] Nyytro84: So because they have office space the workers have to move to high rent/high cost of living places?
[4:58:32] 3ll3nwood: rofl
[4:58:33] trevomancho: @Towelliee i pesonaly will ask the question did with return to work did they up thw lages to cover the gas ?
[4:58:38] Artheneas: A lot of these companies lately want to push the company "culture" which is stupid
[4:58:46] Chibs243: @freetherocktv I have a friend who lived in SF for a time. He felt that the high cost of living and the ever present smell of human waste was too much to live with.
[4:58:46] smashwow: the big deal is they have this HO building that they have to explain. and when people WFH they can't explain it
[4:58:49] freetherocktv: @Nyytro84 no that is a terrible take not everyone can be productive without someone checking on them FailFish and when you are home you don't work the same unless you have DISIPLINE which a lot of people dont have
[4:58:51] Scoodles91: the throne room :D
[4:58:57] falldrgn: the issue now is when you WFH for 2 years then move.. and they want you go back to the office and  you can't, people are getting fired
[4:59:05] viciousmeh: Fuck company culture...
[4:59:08] Blah206: Ghost Crawler's new studio is fully remote

[4:59:41] convrge: my company wants people back in for 'community', which is bullshit. Its just for the tax breaks on the building

[4:59:58] DecayedmiNt: World would be different if companies were increasing wage based on inflation
[5:00:12] mavericks312: they get paid so technically yes they do pay for there gas
[5:00:19] Broomba: Irvine is like the Vatican
[5:00:21] SmallzzIV: They were in a way... it is your salary after all. So unless they adjust for 2x gas prices in your salary then kinda F'd
[5:00:24] freetherocktv: @t_train_va THAT IS YOU not the majority of our population you must never notice or see LAZY people LUL
[5:00:29] Artheneas: Like 3-4k
[5:00:30] mavericks312: @DecayedmiNt so you want increased layoffs then lol
[5:00:33] ObsidianHealer: Its insane to live there
[5:00:34] tylive52: still have to pay cali taxes
[5:00:35] dream_boxing: Too damn much
[5:00:45] Ezcotli: No billboards allowed in Irvine
[5:00:46] viciousmeh: the fact that companies have to raise wages based on inflation, is a clear indicator they were not paying you fairly in the first place...
[5:00:51] PhillyDilly18: 6-7 figure homes - https://www.zillow.com/irvine-ca/
[5:00:57] Shugaze: like college students
[5:00:59] Parkerhits: I live in the bay area 2 bed 2 bath 3800 a month
[5:01:12] Piebringer619: well HOUSE PRICING IS INSANE
[5:01:21] StraightErro: It costs more to live homeless under a bridge in Irvine, than getting a house almost anywhere else
[5:01:28] Dr_ShockLoL: literally stealing lol. theres no reason that has to happen, but ppl wont stand up against it and its sad
[5:01:31] Nyytro84: but they should go to office cause the companies have office space *DERP*
[5:01:38] viciousmeh: no one wants to live in my state... just how we like it lol
[5:01:47] DecayedmiNt: @mavericks312 No. Im just saying that in general. In reality there's a reason no company is doing that. It's not their job to increase pay when something out of their control happens
[5:01:54] Mecabeast: If a company can't afford to pay a liveable amount for the sounding area they should probably relocate
[5:01:55] freetherocktv: @Towelliee my grandma sold her 2 bedroom small house in San Leandro for $600,000 because its in a "safe" area for Cali and near a park
[5:02:10] Broomba: @towelliee - Irvine is like the Vatican its own entity
[5:02:16] toyhutt: T, you were homeless at one point right?  Rags to Riches Bitches
[5:02:20] northsidegamer212: what is an avg salary for someone in Irvine?

[5:02:36] mavericks312: @DecayedmiNt sure in theory yes it owuld be nice but in reality thats added company costs and guess what gets cut first
[5:02:38] Wulfgrym: commercial property is on the verge of a massive collapse in the US due to the work at home, but it was saving money for companies, going to be intersting how this plays out in the corporate world, now that people got to see how it is working from home

[5:02:47] Dr_ShockLoL: @DecayedmiNt that depends tbh. because if that were 100% the case, 100% of the time, then wages would never increase, everything else would, and no one, and I mean no one, would afford anything with enough time past.

[6:46:18] PigPenLen: just like my wife, never reads the directions

[7:02:10] Shugaze: oh god

[7:02:29] gorgub: I would not trust any puggers on HC

[7:02:56] essadis: our 60 warrior died on the same day he got 60
[7:03:01] GroovyBryan: So the play is, hit 60 and retire in stormwind. Lol
[7:03:02] dreamwalker213: @demonicyoshi I mean there wouldn’t really be anything to do, you won’t raid or do dungeons because everyone is hardcore
[7:03:02] nilachip: but whats the goal of HC ? 60 and clear all end-game content ?
[7:03:04] Nerendis: There was a 59 horde death last night too
[7:03:08] Shugaze: @rosina_scarlett it would make sense lol, imagine throwing away days of /played
[7:03:10] Overhaul_1229: get them threat meters
