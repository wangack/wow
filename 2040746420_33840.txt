[10:58:25] LetsGoPolice: and now he goes back in retirement again UltraSad
[10:58:30] czeksmyx: I hate Night Elves even more then Dragons, so this wasn't my expansion at all
[10:58:39] dankNstein_: do you like dwarves
[10:58:42] czeksmyx: yes

[11:19:56] zara1024: I'm a megadungeon enjoyer
[11:19:59] LetsGoPolice: fuck these frogs, when I was deep in the tusks shit I would run it over and over again on heroic just to bonus roll
[11:20:03] GamerBoiTaz: i feel like
[11:20:10] czeksmyx: I want some Chad to Bloody Coin Moose into the ground
[11:20:24] GamerBoiTaz: the way Dawn was set up was absolutely meant for the mythic plus split
[11:21:08] StreamElements: Can't get enough Moose? Check out the YouTube VOD archive at https://youtube.com/@Moosebrother for Classic Roleplay and Variety Streams, archived by your favorite mod ChiDorky

[11:23:55] Hento: updating my laptop that has not been turned on since october lol
[11:23:58] Swiftym8: lulWut
[11:24:03] czeksmyx: knowing chat, they're all crankin it
[11:24:08] itsbubbzi: mbroCozy
[11:24:20] LetsGoPolice: wait wtf they are buffing the axe again
[11:24:31] Swiftym8: Wankge now that was content
[11:24:32] GamerBoiTaz: mbroDumpy mbroDumpy
[11:24:52] Hento: god the last thing I played was SOD and seeing modern retail bag space is mind blowing lol
[11:25:15] Huso833: oooh GMOD
[11:25:38] LetsGoPolice: do you have the jaina mount?
[11:25:49] zara1024: I tried recently, there are some roadblocks that I couldn't get past solo
[11:26:01] zara1024: like Lady Ashvane solo
[11:26:18] Hento: oh did they finally add in dragon riding anywhere?
[11:26:20] itsbubbzi: I need to go farm red scythe of the unmaker
[11:26:27] czeksmyx: I should get off my ass and grind lava snail
[11:27:48] czeksmyx: 85% speed for mystery reason
[11:28:02] Huso833: spaghetti code
[11:28:11] zara1024: TIL there's a cap outside dragon isles
[11:28:16] zara1024: maybe for flavour/lore
[11:28:47] itsbubbzi: Different air density so its harder for dragons idk
[11:28:49] Huso833: that's WAY too cool for us to allow that
[11:29:07] Vikinick: now they made dracthyr flying just dragonriding anyways
[11:29:15] Huso833: Maybe the dragons are less effective outside of their home
[11:29:36] LetsGoPolice: Azerite Armor PEPW
[11:31:17] czeksmyx: You guys don't like having to level new gear each time you replace shit?
[11:31:19] czeksmyx: weird
[11:31:21] Hento: classic blizzard double down
[11:31:39] masterarkaine: yeah gear talents was dumb
[11:31:48] Hento: swirl it all up in a bucket fuck it
[11:32:10] LetsGoPolice: also I didnt hate thunderforging/warforging. was nice to see giga pieces of gear that circumvent BIS lists
[11:32:37] TSutt: Corruption went hard when you had the right setup
[11:33:18] Huso833: just made me yawn too...
[11:33:22] LetsGoPolice: looks like black temple
[11:33:32] LetsGoPolice: Antorus had the one that looks like a pirate
[11:33:41] masterarkaine: Current season is a joke. Dream rep rank 20 takes no time once that 1st toon has it. My monk had rank 20 in 4.5 hrs today and there was a dinner pause in there. I did full lfr and normal today on it too, im 455 ilvl just over 24 hrs at 70
[11:33:52] czeksmyx: Borrowed power in general is dumb as hell. It's like they're terrified to come up with new spells without testing them out with Covenants/artifact weapons
[11:34:33] czeksmyx: I remember Fran Sadge
[11:34:50] Huso833: Bring back twilight devestation
[11:35:06] zara1024: yeah that's the best part of wow these days KEKW
[11:35:17] zara1024: which it is next expansion
[11:35:18] TSutt: Wait, why would you want to farm max rep at the same speed on alts
[11:35:20] TSutt: HUHH
[11:35:21] Hento: moving forward it seems like all things are gonna be account wide, and thats amazing
[11:35:35] Huso833: Yeah I want more alt shit
[11:35:44] masterarkaine: No, a good way. I have one of every armor now 70, 3 are 9/9H atm. Its great'
[11:35:46] Huso833: The best thing they did was add heirloom gear
[11:36:02] LetsGoPolice: do it on the worst spec KEKW
[11:36:02] masterarkaine: Easy gear ansd this community has been amazing
[11:36:10] Hento: I remember grinding for heirloom gear back in the day haha
[11:36:22] Hento: and when I came back ahving to unlock it all by finding it on my alts lol
[11:36:28] czeksmyx: affliction lock
[11:36:41] czeksmyx: KEKW
[11:36:45] zara1024: dude I fucking live for zero to hero series on youtube KEKW
[11:36:59] zara1024: they're so fun
[11:37:13] czeksmyx: make Moose level enhancement
[11:37:15] Vikinick: subtlety is the least played spec in the game
[11:37:17] itsbubbzi: 0 to hero late night streams after rp
[11:37:20] TSutt: Aff is probably a bit better than it looks, but no one plays it coz of Destro and Demo KEKW
[11:37:29] itsbubbzi: I'd watch
[11:37:36] Vikinick: and then survival
[11:37:40] Hento: late night wow is terrible lol
[11:37:46] Huso833: Despairge the Ragnaros groups
[11:37:46] zara1024: a lotta oce groups Gladge
[11:37:49] Hento: trying to get in keys late night is horrible
[11:37:55] dankNstein_: my pgf blocks oce
[11:38:03] dankNstein_: i cant play with 1 sec delay
[11:38:08] TSutt: OCE Gladge
[11:38:19] dankNstein_: trying to find 26-27s at this time is almost impossible
[11:38:29] dankNstein_: i just gave up
[11:38:32] dankNstein_: and started playing an alt
[11:38:56] itsbubbzi: That would be part of the challenge though moose
[11:39:04] masterarkaine: lets go 3 surv hunter runs
[11:39:29] Hento: Feral is just spinning plates
[11:39:35] Hento: and snapshotting
[11:39:43] itsbubbzi: No playing with ragnoros would be the challenge
[11:39:44] Hento: just for us lol
[11:39:46] czeksmyx: that sounds awful
[11:39:50] Vikinick: Bear, Subtlety, Survival, Ele, Pres?
[11:39:59] Hento: keeping up dots, and energy and combo points
[11:40:09] Vikinick: they are
[11:40:15] dankNstein_: range is cringe
[11:40:16] Vikinick: there's no bad healers this expansion
[11:40:21] LetsGoPolice: 35 yard range
[11:40:25] Vikinick: it's just all the pres evokers went aug lol
[11:40:27] masterarkaine: Bear, Surv, Sub, Aff lock, Pres
[11:40:37] itsbubbzi: pres is still good but you would rather have the aug
[11:40:45] Hento: all evokers just went aug lol
[11:40:52] czeksmyx: RIP
[11:40:52] LetsGoPolice: you might have the wrong coins
[11:40:54] dankNstein_: aug is slowly getting pushed out
[11:41:09] thestarsaredown: was this the expansion where they had like 3 coin types or something dumb
[11:41:14] Hento: really? when I stopped aug was mandatory lol
[11:41:16] Vikinick: There's like 5 mythic raiders just fucking the rest of MM hunters
[11:41:23] masterarkaine: Surv has nice aoe, MM aoe slow
[11:41:41] dankNstein_: you dont need aug anymore
[11:41:46] dankNstein_: tank trinkets are op
[11:41:51] czeksmyx: don't have to be off-meta, just do stuff you don't ever do
[11:41:58] dankNstein_: they used to be god tier
[11:42:02] dankNstein_: they are insane in raid
[11:42:02] Vikinick: MM AOE is like amazing for the first ... 20 seconds
[11:42:17] czeksmyx: heh, that might be sick
[11:42:23] czeksmyx: fuckin Outlaw
[11:42:37] dankNstein_: aug actually makes some fights just miserable like a high tyran iridikron
[11:42:37] itsbubbzi: outlaw seems really fun
[11:42:48] dankNstein_: i think you get 1 less shield phase with 3 dps
[11:43:08] masterarkaine: I cannot make Demo lock ST work, buts it fun aoe
[11:43:37] LetsGoPolice: have you ever healed before? might be a different change of pace
[11:43:45] dankNstein_: on waycrest tree boss im thinking of just leaving dung and going dev everytime
[11:43:49] Hento: i like destro, but i like brain dead lol
[11:43:54] itsbubbzi: would you really want to play lock though and just complain about pet classes the whole time
[11:44:30] masterarkaine: BM is facerool, antone with gear can make BM work
[11:44:34] TSutt: At the start of patches they do
[11:44:36] Vikinick: not unless you're taunting with the hunter pets
[11:44:52] dankNstein_: lock imps still go rogue sometimes
[11:44:54] dankNstein_: and wipe keys
[11:45:08] LetsGoPolice: pres evoker nodd
[11:45:15] TSutt: Going invis as Demo is a lottery KEKW
[11:45:17] Hento: I mean try feral, I am still gonna play it eventually lol
[11:45:32] czeksmyx: outlaw rogue, enhancement shaman, ret paladin
[11:45:33] Hento: i just did it in wrath classic, then when dragon came out i was like fuck it
[11:45:34] GamerBoiTaz: Arcane is fun

[11:45:45] dankNstein_: watch preheats arcane mage rotation video
[11:45:48] dankNstein_: youll not want to play it
[11:45:50] GamerBoiTaz: Look at the rotation page on arcane
[11:45:55] Hento: arcane rotation is mega mind
[11:45:57] masterarkaine: its ramp is funny to see but fuck ur mana, fuck ur life
[11:46:05] GamerBoiTaz: its easy once you get it
[11:46:12] GamerBoiTaz: DH gamer
[11:46:14] itsbubbzi: You would need to download more RAM to play arcane mage
[11:46:19] masterarkaine: Arms Warrior
[11:46:29] czeksmyx: could play a DK
[11:46:34] itsbubbzi: I'd say feral or outlaw then
[11:46:35] Vikinick: feral?
[11:46:35] dankNstein_: dh rotation actually isnt braindead anymore
[11:46:37] dankNstein_: but it isnt fun
[11:46:39] czeksmyx: enhancement shaman

[11:47:03] masterarkaine: ret is fun but they are everywhere
[11:47:21] itsbubbzi: You gonna join pally gang?
[11:47:23] Vikinick: ok so if you want to play arcane mage, this will be your life https://i.imgur.com/1VWuswt.png
[11:47:24] dankNstein_: the tier set this season makes ret so enjoyable to play
