[1:00:19] asso4: Please remove ovoker from the game
[1:00:20] gAbbAsHoW: AUGMENTATION WAS A MISTAKE
[1:00:23] SelistriaMonk: @sexyvulperamage6969 yes
[1:00:27] senhorelefanto: @Ïû¨ÏπòÏûàÎäî maybe its a strategy to fit the comp better
[1:00:28] paradoxyy: @sexyvulperamage6969 yes
[1:00:32] ModeraYsera: @sexyvulperamage6969 tournament realm reflects live servers, so yes they have the same nerfs

[1:01:23] heyitsferris: @bizzenwow Brackenhide Hollow
[1:01:25] Valhooli: @Ïû¨ÏπòÏûàÎäî I think you give up less damage to go flay so you can take things like mental fortitude and silence by going that route, both flay and spike are viable and quite close in overall damage
[1:01:27] paradoxyy: @bizzenwow  neltharus

[1:58:57] Strayyed212: @poeckie87 the aug is probably doing more damage than the Spriest, you just can't see it on details due to combat hooks details is missing.
[1:59:09] heyitsferris: @moltencrucible that's me hi
[1:59:10] VyNKaSMyN_: Guys, I got it: it's written "Junkat" but it's read like "makes" Kappa
[1:59:12] folmer666: This is so boring, when rack team run with the same class setup. Its all Down to clean pulls, rather than class divergence. Fix your game blizzard! Make loads more classes relevant!
[1:59:25] N00B_L0RD: Shark Puncher killed fishface i just read the lore
[1:59:34] Xana_oce: @folmer666 they'd have to delete augmentationa for that one bud

[2:00:45] lottogato: @Khaivet it isn't sad. It is just straight up boring.
[2:00:52] Etocx: game is dead
[2:00:59] shiftfazed: @Khaivet why? what would chnage if every team was different
[2:01:05] macmittens808: aug is op, these are the best classes to pair with aug, blizz wants them in TGP so they dont nerf it is what it is
[2:01:09] tonymoltana: who cares LUL

[2:01:26] HalberdWesker: At least the best comp isn't 2 rogues + monk debuff. :D
[2:01:32] doowly1: @Khaivet the teams will almost always be the same, almost like its competitive or something
[2:01:46] Warryour: @doowly1 Not true. Ever seen past competitions?
[2:01:53] Khaivet: if all you play is the same classes then what is the point of having more than 6
[2:01:53] gundius: Dratnos GIGACHAD
[2:01:59] Moly_42: what sort of key level are we expecting at the very high end? Haven't been keeping up at all this season
[2:02:08] SnubsWub: Teams have always played the same comps in every mythic + tournament why is everyone crying lol

[2:03:30] sallinth: chat crying? never
[2:03:31] SharbogUK: It's not the players fault that they choose the same group compositions. It's a fault with the game. :(
[2:03:32] Beat0n: @YuriyMeln same, don't wanna play them either,
[2:03:32] bobbyj1585: Dont do class reworks, or spec debuts a week before a major annual tournament starts... so dumb (forward this to blizzard casters)
[2:03:35] weRmuh: Halls of Infusion, last boss. tyrannical 3 intermissions.. gg
[2:03:37] Grandpa_Zaltah: I'm curious how high they could push if there were no affix's

[2:04:51] lurkbelow82: the synergy of this comp is too strong, they would have to nerf to unplayable level to break it for the comp, it's over, wow has no place for support specs imo

[2:13:44] Ghamera: Xyro, the competition last week was fierce, but I think this weekend teams are more evenly matched across the board
[2:13:54] aknoN: Honestly I feel the only meta class prior to 10.1.5 was for sure spriest. Everything else couldve been anything.
[2:14:02] bobbyj1585: People played DH tank, Prot pally tank..... and before mage there were ret pallies in top keys etc... so now that bear is OP and no ret pallies.. they are forced on hpal for pally utility.. not to mention the pally rework ALSO made them super good

[4:56:18] Dassine: Because they can finish this run, and still have time for another go with something?
[4:56:25] icolacegaming: @LIZARD_Monukuma As the leaders - they potentially dont want to give away vocal strats.
[4:56:26] datmenace: @Zssjgodx not at all
[4:56:29] Dassine: If they restarted, they wouldn't have time for another run after probably

[4:56:59] LIZARD_Monukuma: This POV is good :D

[4:58:11] boochacho: thebunten was talking mad game about dratnos's shirt but we cannot see it
[4:58:44] warrpp: Cool beans is making the right play, the 29 is the tie breaker
[4:58:44] icolacegaming: @moltencrucible These key levels are very high. Potential mistakes or unlucky moments from overlapping damage intakes are common. Not everyone can do these levels smoothly. Any of these teams have the potential to fail at any point.

[5:01:08] icolacegaming: @moltencrucible The level of play that any of these teams are playing at is near or at the top of any live servers as of now. Just because one team is doing worse than another, does not mean that they're playing poorly or were not prepared.
[5:01:16] bezmilosti1: Bear dies thats not how it goes :)
[5:01:27] v1vids: @v1vids this changes the appearance of apparitions?
[5:01:38] Jereico: @v1vids Specifically the Fate Mirror talent makes attacks have a chance to deal extra damage, and that has the little sand visual

[5:50:10] icolacegaming: Bro that Ansu only did like 10% of the totem
[5:50:21] moohuu: destro+sanguine is double-bad. bals stuns when you don't want it, and mobs get pulled out of your rain of fire constantly.
[5:50:32] deathray5538: oh nooooo
[5:50:32] kharr32x: should be limited to blue gear in this tbh

[5:52:21] Linodinosaur: @Linodinosaur maybe not saying the "best" comp but there is always going to be a prefered comp over other comps based on how the game i designed. The exodia comp i think is the worst case ive seen so far having a forced comp in high push keys.
