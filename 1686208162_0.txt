[0:47:10] Raitru_08: @BodenLive Never played Predecessor, but since it's a buy to play, I'll tell you right now, it's definitely better.
[0:47:10] dabbinjames: @shroud i think keeping it free and using microtransactions like skins and stuff will be the best move
[0:47:12] tiimkaaa: Hey, Shroud! I think its time for u to explore ''Black Desert'' gameplay! :)
[0:47:13] shoaibhugh: S
[0:47:14] Khayjin: thing is, if they wait till it's released to make the money, the investment will take even longer and they will probably lose most of their playerbase on the way there

[3:42:11] RickestGrimes: why try to ruin the game by maxing brightness
[3:42:15] maleblackfiora: yeah no duh the  game is called dark and darker cant exactly say on wait its too dark
[3:42:29] RidingHippos: @RickestGrimes it doesnt ruin the game, it makes it slightly more vissible and better for streaming
[3:42:38] RidingHippos: compression of dark sccenese sucks
[3:42:46] BloodyLlama: BloodyLlama subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[3:42:49] Rawse_xx: xqcL
[3:42:51] RomanApollo: unlimited arrows?
[3:42:52] ragesaq: you can increase the brightness but it doesnt really change how visible things are
[3:42:55] MrSt3a1th123: what perks are best for ranger?

[3:43:12] RomanApollo: @RomanApollo cool

[3:43:19] maleblackfiora: the came is blocking the arrow stack count but yeah unlimited

[3:43:30] RyGuyHollywood: i dont think you HAVE to fight other players...or do you?
[3:43:45] culex555: recurve have 6 arrows/longbow 5 arrows

[3:44:07] culex555: ratting is good if youre solo or broke
[3:44:13] RyGuyHollywood: @RyGuyHollywood right, so can still win without having to kill anyone. im sure its hard
[3:44:18] soledbykay: @RyGuyHollywood I prefer to kill players and loot them, it gives more loot than just running around the map looking for chests and monsters.

[3:55:13] RidingHippos: it doesnt look as dark playing it tbh, video compression of streaming sucks for dark stuff
[3:55:14] dralyx_: 6 dead YEP
[3:55:19] lostmyaccthx: @ridinghippos pretty sure its brighter for him. like by a lot. its just we cant see it. he was shooting a skele perfectly that i couldnt even see at all
[3:55:24] gnfnrf: @taegoLake That's the resolution that loaded for me.  Never noticed it before, but that doesn't mean it's new.
[3:55:28] Derpatron5000: !headbat
[3:55:42] Xtr34MOo: you can destroy the barrels and vases and find loot in it
[3:55:53] RyGuyHollywood: @lostmyaccthx i wouldnt call it bad lighting its just the way the game was intended to play. Which is also what i meant by real feeling being that this isnt the true real look of the game
[3:55:57] LotsOfCuddIes: stop
[3:56:04] FAT4LS: that is why having cleric for healing is crucial in the team haha

[3:56:32] RidingHippos: not really*
[3:56:42] ConstantinE_11: Is this game all based underground?  Is the outside world deadly or something?
[3:56:51] Gunman_90: pew pew pew
[3:56:51] gnfnrf: I wonder if the bitrate cap has gone up too, though.  I know some streamers would deliberately stream lower resolution for higher bitrate because it looked better overall.
[3:56:53] HarkIInnG: o dont see shit
[3:56:55] SnD_Scholar: I love Dark and Darker. Mage and Rogue are my favorite. Fighter and Drunken Cleric are also good.

[4:06:42] StickyJuicy: LULW
[4:06:46] mosestylez: Is this game fun?
[4:06:46] Swiftfool: Barb is weak af
[4:06:48] CZ75_SP01: Pog
[4:06:53] bingozura: Damn did blood just come out from a skeleton
[4:06:58] dashete: @mosestylez it is and it isn't at the same time
[4:07:00] RyGuyHollywood: no where near as fun with friend(s)
[4:07:08] ragesaq: this game is super fun, its fun losing
[4:07:09] doobiefreshong: @Swiftfool hes great in a team
[4:07:11] RidingHippos: @vvargstrider just play rogue or ranger solo, its one of the best ways to learn and get better at the game
[4:07:16] Swiftfool: @bingozura where do you think blood is formed?
[4:07:21] RyGuyHollywood: great fun friend game
[4:07:23] misteronetwo518: game is not fun, nobody is playing it, not even shroud
[4:07:25] ragesaq: end circle fun when you are fighting and trying to extract is wild
[4:07:31] Swiftfool: @doobiefreshong but literally any other class is better in a team
[4:07:33] moonmoonslasthair: cant wait for the forest map of this to hit in the future
[4:07:36] SimplyBlunt: @kruem_ same, plus its a playtest so all progress is being erased at launch
[4:07:38] AurelStar: What about Longbow switch recurve bow to adapt in all situations?
[4:07:39] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[4:07:40] Fluxss_: kek skeleton shooting out blood
[4:07:43] lostmyaccthx: @kruem_ try some ranger solo. its hilarious with the traps tbh. kill a team and play like a rat to bank some gold then u can play more freely
[4:07:45] RickestGrimes: pore skele :(
[4:07:45] doobiefreshong: @Swiftfool eh not rogue
[4:07:46] Canal2Playerz: Blood from a skeleton?
[4:07:47] manlydann: @Swiftfool you shouldnt use 2handed in pvp
[4:07:51] Cping9800: @DaFluxs LOOOOOL
[4:07:58] SimplyBlunt: @ridinghippos i had a lot of fun with ranger, but as soon as i ran into a group i stood no chance
[4:08:01] misteronetwo518: its not blood its molten bone marrow
[4:08:01] KULA_______: BONE MARROW LUL
[4:08:02] RyGuyHollywood: @Canal2Playerz games not done, sooo who knows
[4:08:04] wknd101: What is your take on the game as a whole? Do you think it will last like tarkov when it comes out?
[4:08:07] sewo94: @canal2playerz yes hahah
[4:08:11] Swiftfool: @doobiefreshong You havent seen the rogue wizard pvp montages literally everywhere
[4:08:16] StickyJuicy: LongSword is good
[4:08:17] ragesaq: longsword is 2h, slow, not worth losing the shield IMO
[4:08:27] RidingHippos: @vvargstrider stack agility and movespeed and learn to run away, set traps etc, you can easily kill 3 mans with clever plaay,, or just run awya
[4:08:28] Enigmata__: and a heater shield in that chest
[4:09:02] ImGonnaGoHome: shroud forsen said he wants to play
[4:09:10] doobiefreshong: @Swiftfool just depends on the comp, if running cleric ranger or double ranger barb is better than rogue imo
[4:09:11] Studiouss: !loadout

[4:09:16] w4ngsworld: turn up your brightness
[4:09:32] RyGuyHollywood: @w4ngsworld he did and already and fuckno
[4:09:40] RidingHippos: @vvargstrider I'm not saying its easy, but its definitely very viable, i make it out of nearly 50% of my ranger solo raids

[4:54:48] pioxqc2: skeleton bleeds
[4:54:54] D0_Androids_Dream: Most ppl I see play this don't block, they just move out of the way of enemy hits.
[4:54:54] MegaHz408: @Sandoorus you good
[4:54:55] lockecole777: blocking is kind of dogshit in this game

[4:55:12] SnD_Scholar: Blocking is more in depth than you think.
[4:55:15] illastration1: i like concept of this game but the movement looks frustratingly slow.
[4:55:16] vascocardoso6: @lockecole777 if u dont know how to use it
[4:55:21] barz___: @lockecole777  u have to block the direction the attack is coming from
[4:55:25] iamdecentkinda: gota crouch and look up for archers
[4:55:27] XVengefu1: @XVengefu1 Thanks I never have it that high so didn't realize
[4:55:29] RawREvO: high roller gives higher quality gear or if you go to level 2/3

[4:55:52] lockecole777: @lockecole777 it's still bad, they admit it in the discord, its being reworked.
[4:55:57] RawREvO: the shield also have like a block dmg if the weapon/monster does too much dmg it will go through so quality helps on the shield
[4:56:01] StickyJuicy: no
[4:56:02] maxdopamin: nope
[4:56:03] deleriumxl: its suppose to be slow. you can really feel the difference if you go move speed
