[0:30:25] shrektwo_ondvd: for arcane mage healing and raiding do you reccomend stacking Arcane Wrath gear? @Xaryu
[0:30:27] fierypunch: playing with my partner and lag hasnt been bad at all

[0:31:10] zodd_amhai: the timing is soo wrong!
[0:31:11] fellifell: gnomer is lost characters for sure, it’s a shame
[0:31:11] baldanduseless: do it casually when gnomer gets raid log status would be fun @Xaryu
[0:31:12] 93__: you should all be on attack instead of on defense
[0:31:14] gnomiter: fence going to break
[0:31:17] tonyg_1103: and its fun

[0:31:58] chrislu18: SSF will be worth the wait. Finish P2
[0:31:58] data_byte_visuals: GM Xaryu, pardon me but whats a BIS Mount?
[0:32:01] Paladez: HC ph2 SOD?
[0:32:05] angelc843: The timing is terrible, and this game was never meant to be played solo. Thats why watching streamers do difficult content solo is enjoyable, but watching someone just play the game completely solo from the beginning stages of the game? Feels off.
[0:32:09] bryn_dee: So it isn't SOLO self found, just self found, ya? Can still Group up and run the dungeons 1 per day?
[0:32:09] Lokja: HC is tons of fun, got 60 recently, been running dungeons with guildies, mourning our lost brethren, helping them restart :)
[0:32:18] Too_Tall74: That widow's peak is sharp @Xaryu
[0:32:35] Jarnes7: Vegeta peak

[0:34:24] The_RightTwix: There is more personal responsibility that classic players are used to
[0:34:26] Too_Tall74: i got the same widows peak myself, shave that shit off everyday and by the next morning it reappears
[0:34:30] Nezzy243: sylvannas was a long fight
[0:34:31] unitedixd: is there any diff on pvp mount  to the regular one ?
[0:34:33] kirk_hunts: Hardest fight in the game is electrocutioner all of a sudden.
[0:34:33] jakdax20: gnomer is so fun, i love it
[0:34:33] IanEdgerton: Not hard but punishing
[0:34:33] Shunmao: its fun

[0:34:47] omwforyogirl: good morning xar and chat
[0:35:10] The_RightTwix: I still think the classic raids could be more difficult, I would like to see more complex mechanics

[0:35:29] bakeranders: baby on stream yesterday!?!?

[0:35:37] kirk_hunts: Gnomer is a blast. I just wish it was on a weekly lockout these three days are killing me as a GM.
[0:35:42] cjplayingu: are you doing the pvp tournament
[0:35:46] Mortz82: never got into BWL in Vanilla, Raggy was the height before TBC
[0:35:47] AndoBotzz: and look super cool on that mount!
[0:35:51] thandelmtj: Ayee good luck on it bro
[0:35:51] jfive87: hey @xaryu can you show me a good fire spec for PvP and pve?
[0:35:52] Meanpandah: i want karazhan
[0:36:02] fakebalmung: hello @Xaryu hows it going
[0:36:04] ggmage60: do you have a suggestion for capping hit for Fire Mage and still get Combustion?
[0:36:09] baldanduseless: theyve done well with two raids

[0:37:04] ikerislock: No nerf
[0:37:04] Djinx_o: last boss nice
[0:37:05] swidey221: last boss needs a lil nerf
[0:37:06] ssbm_geo: So we didn't clear the last boss last night but it felt like we could have done in
[0:37:06] myyrlidon: Xar i think because the loot in sod is so good they will reduce the raid to a 20 man raid and they will change some of the stats of the bosses
[0:37:08] Reaperz_kinetic: pretty perfect imo
[0:37:09] detlid: bonus xp until you hit level 25 is also a huge help for people just starting SoD

[0:37:16] fakebalmung: lets say its time consuming..
[0:37:16] fetza108: yeah but its a level up raid
[0:37:17] revora_: I think its pretty good difficulty but I think last 2 will be nerfed.
[0:37:20] NvSuros: if you stay with the same group and learn together and are all on the same page its not otoo hard
[0:37:22] Nick_2cv: 10 man is a prob.
[0:37:23] woocal: to hard, my boomer brain cant handle movement
[0:37:24] TheMemphisStrangler: I think just right is it being hard enough that if you don't know the fights you're not gonna 1 shot everything
[0:37:32] ChuggaChops: I just dont like it requires like 3 healers on last boss
[0:37:37] ikerislock: Would be so lame of they nerf it. It's not hard
[0:37:41] enoch87bear: went from juggling 4 25's to maning 1 40
[0:37:49] myyrlidon: Xar i think because the loot in sod is so good they will reduce the raid to a 20 man raid and they will change some of the stats of the bosses

[0:38:12] jfive87: @xaryu can you show me a good PvP/pve fire spec for mage?
[0:38:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @swidey221 that’s very very wrong
[0:38:13] Mico027: The only thing hard in the raid is bomb management if you dont have a warlock or Druid
[0:38:22] raven234: Hi

[0:52:33] Okizoo: I like that
[0:52:34] 2oublewidesuprise: I agree
[0:52:34] Chefwhisker: This is why WoW classic was a success. Most of us were in high school when WoW reached peak around BC and LC expansions. So this was a HUGE nostalgia proc for everyone.
[0:52:35] hamsti: I can't wait for my AI robot to do work for me so i can just game all day

[0:53:55] ikerislock: PP is way down
[0:54:01] lil_yahteez: quality of life peaked when you could buy a 3 bed house for 2 chickens
[0:54:01] IanEdgerton: a lot of those number appear to go up as more is quantified and recorded these days
[0:54:03] Dafrekknpope: everyone test prime sub to check

[0:54:05] Cowmance: prime sub works. I subbed thru prime yesterday
[0:54:08] donslipy: @Xaryu what you think about cryptos?
[0:54:09] draethyst: purchasing power has decreased in the past 50 minutes…
[0:54:10] Grandmarshal: air quality, food quality, stress levels, etc is all worse nowadays
[0:54:14] encrypteddeath: I was confused on how to use the prime sub too. once you click subscribe there is a drop down menu
[0:54:17] hamsti: Ya will be interesting to see how it goes. Whether its this generation or a future one i think eventually it gets to that point. @andypandynz haven't a clue what itll look like though
[0:54:21] c7drew: questing in SoD from 35-40 is kind of rough, gotta run all over the world for a couple quests at a time
[0:54:25] andypandynz: life was good in late 2000s when tech was good but not fully taken over
[0:54:26] BoriOrtiz: if you think about the difference in life expectancy that changes everything.
[0:54:27] ralphh1541: social media creates comparisons and FOMO.  It's a cancer on socity imo
[0:54:29] Zynotlive: crime is way lower we just know about more of it happening
[0:54:30] Am0n3r: Weird flex being able to read
[0:54:30] zenithxo1: older generations could buy a house, a car, and support an entire household being the only person working on minimum wage

[0:54:50] t1isokatleague: so ppl cant think lol
[0:54:54] chobinhood_: I work from home so there is zero separation. Can confirm I'm miserable
[0:54:55] Muckbot1: YEP 100%
[0:54:58] The_RightTwix: 5 years ago I got tired of constantly being promised pay raises and promotions, and never get them. So I quit and started my own business
[0:55:00] andypandynz: my dad bought his first 500k house on a $500 deposit LUL
[0:55:01] beccaria21: !addon

[0:55:05] detourz28: I hate being a knowledge worker. It sucks
[0:55:05] willyblaster7: so unemployed = happiest
[0:55:06] BrewTTV: Psychology of Money is amazing. You don't need a reason to save, you just should save. Life with get you eventually and that savings could save you.
[0:55:09] ikerislock: Interesting take
[0:55:09] Grandmarshal: @knawledged yeah agree
[0:55:10] 2oublewidesuprise: i understand that
[0:55:13] hamsti: @chobinhood_ if you can separate a work space from a play space. It helps sooo much 100%
[0:55:15] chronicbubonic: all I think about is where my next hit of crack is coming from
[0:55:15] Chefwhisker: I do manual production labor while my wife is a Professor. She has to bring her work home while i get to leave everything where i clock out.
[0:55:16] xgugga: as a software developer I agree
[0:55:17] Elbandiv: @Xaryu what do u think about jorden peterson?
[0:55:21] Yinng_K: but work is also passion

[0:55:25] t1isokatleague: that ur choice buddy lol
[0:55:26] Rumpnisse0: What was the name of the 2 books?
[0:55:26] Deceasedcheeks: Not having Instagram to compare your life to a fake image of other people's lives also helped a lot

[0:55:28] wowsuomi: Yeah u can switch off faster but u have no eanergy left
[0:55:30] Kisotope_: Look at percentage of families that stay together. Broken homes create a general societal strife.

[0:55:37] AchilleFPS: just wanna say goddam the YouTube grind is real thanks for posting
[0:55:40] legendarism: HI YOUTUBE
[0:55:44] ryan___mcg: so much accessibility (to so much information , to contact anyone at any minute ) is unprecedented for humans and i think it’s been very difficult for young people specifically to navigate as tech has progressed
[0:55:45] polisasinmash: This isn't true for peoplpe who have physical pain and have to work through it
[0:55:45] Mankins45: thankfully I love my job
[0:55:50] hamsti: It blows my mind what the average household income is atm. I don't get how people survive.
[0:55:51] chobinhood_: @hamsti Yeah, I've tried that. I think under normal circumstances it would work for me, but my job is hella competitive
[0:55:52] pickb: but wouldnt the people thinking of work feel more rewarded/valued person
[0:55:54] StreamElements: @Lil_levix, lil_levix has been following xaryu for  5 years 7 months 26 days 8 hours

[0:56:26] justin480: As a doctoral student, I'm constantly thinking about what I should be doing or the current research I'm doing (especially during non-work time). My g/f who was working in the medical field as a tech, had no worries once she was off the clock.
[0:56:28] c7drew: have you heard tony robinns 6 human needs? Made me think more about why we do what we do

[0:56:42] Deceasedcheeks: @teezboi great question lol
[0:56:46] serverfirst300003: lol Petersen is a crime novel writer, he has little useful to say, but the plot of his books is super sick
[0:56:49] AchilleFPS: what do you think about those cloth set -10 stam etc... ?
[0:56:49] Aidu_Eynul: @Xaryu do you find wow still so fun you would play it off stream?

[0:57:11] donslipy: @Xaryu are you a piston head? what brand of cars you like?
[0:57:12] t1isokatleague: slowly turning into china
[0:57:15] Zilverwood_tv: Im studying a bachelor inAI and data and i feel its a big thing to leave work at work. Likely why we've seen an increase in workers "silent quiting".
[0:57:18] curv6: gone down immensely
[0:57:19] Chefwhisker: No state in the US has affordable living for ANYONE on minimum wage.
[0:57:19] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[0:57:20] BrewTTV: For people that don't understand purchasing power, it's the actual value of the dollar you are making versus inflation
[0:57:21] chobinhood_: due to concentration of wealth
[0:57:24] ikerislock: There are also A TON of hyperbolic panic sellers. That combined with infinite platform potential of the internet. Can be daunting for young people
[0:57:28] encrypteddeath: I have tidal charm
[0:57:28] Taxsvcs: Might not be for every person, but finding ways to generate passive income to trade with time has made a world of difference in my family.
[0:57:35] antiz77: Crime is higher with district attorneys decriminalizing crimes and politician's loosing laws along with the defund the police movement cops aren't writing all the minor crime reports.  If you want to look at true crime stats look at murders and stolen cars. everyone reports dead bodies and stolen cars
[0:57:37] laker_prod: germany is about to legalize on first of april
[0:57:38] Solyad: the currency has been absolutely obliterated. THAT is why purchase power is gone.
[0:57:40] BoriOrtiz: Do you still have dreams of WoW?

[1:08:50] dankcheezits: @gdub1177 ita highly dependant on the industry but also the ambition. College is great for technical STEM. anything else IMHO college isn't worth it. Ambition because these can all be learned in moocs or online but for jobs, you'll need actual viable projects to show in place of school
[1:08:52] stroobzbeats: @Xaryu how wild was that MDI clip from yesterday? feel like youd love Mythic + for the creativeness and crafty gameplay
[1:08:53] Kisotope_: id say being that you cant get carried totally in SF would drive popular people away

[1:10:00] The_RightTwix: If people want seperate servers for everything, pretty soon everyone will want their own personal server
[1:10:02] maqzx: ERA!
[1:10:02] TheSward: hes calling era wrath
[1:10:02] andypandynz: blows my mind theres people out there that think retail has less players than classic
[1:10:12] Bakes00: era is not wrath
[1:10:14] Zownos: what is self found?

[1:10:33] Mister_Ript: Y'all keep trying to find ways to show other people how impressively you can play a 20 year old game that's been gamified to oblivion lol
[1:10:39] basmma599: @Zownos using only what you found, no trade no ah
[1:10:39] realandtruephobe: But I wonder if people that would have played SF on a fresh server just won't with this new one. But yeah, you make a lot of sense

[1:19:50] Mister_Ript: Smash Bros has a couple sidescroller maps
[1:19:50] CrayonSandwich: Hollow Knight is one of the Goat side scrollers
[1:19:55] DechCJC: Read steam reviews
[1:19:59] Vandracon: you dont backpedal though. you always side scroll in wow
[1:20:04] myyrlidon: Hollow knight is my second favorite game ever
[1:20:04] PocketLotion: hollow knight is cool af
[1:20:10] andypandynz: side scrollers are 100% stream killer
[1:20:20] Slaughter13x: READ THE BOOKS XAR
[1:20:33] geminuspr: There is a better mage clip from AQ20
[1:20:41] MonkeyOverlord: monkaS
[1:20:45] jakaupr: Oh my
[1:20:47] apexariestv: I posted my quick wow server idea would be fun as a private server idea or if blizzard adopted it
[1:20:51] preacherskid93: big crits
[1:21:11] DuckTwelve: damnnn
[1:21:16] Jomo908: is it pronounced sardaco or sardaco
[1:21:20] espi: that's 38 x 80 gold right there
[1:21:22] jellymann: petri ruined hardcore @Xaryu
[1:21:29] andypandynz: cant even pull trash without a a petri i love classic gamers LUL
[1:21:31] Yeddamand: Hollow knight is what got me into 2D personally. The combat is so simple but very skillbased
[1:21:31] PaperbackWritter: hc is so good to watch
[1:21:32] cronetym1409: SSF plans, race, class, server, guild?
[1:21:34] vepsee: its so boring lmfao
[1:21:38] realandtruephobe: hardcore is still the most fun to watch on twitch
[1:21:42] DuckTwelve: yeah i kinda wish Petri wasnt in HC
[1:21:43] sengip: petri's ruined HC tho
[1:21:45] sadalxx: hardcore with petri's is boring
[1:21:45] x_praxy_x: you feel it in the gut
[1:21:47] kronic10: @xaryu will you be playing and making a guild on ssf ?
[1:21:51] MonkeyOverlord: Microsoft needs to figure out how to bring spice to hardcore.  It just can't keep up with SoD and retail.
[1:21:52] WingsDub: would be awesome with no petri
[1:21:53] AMLoogi: my friend and I had nightmares about our near death experience
[1:21:53] SpaceCowboy0811: might be a rush w/o petri
[1:21:54] sadalxx: if you mess up... you should die
[1:21:55] t1isokatleague: immersion
[1:21:57] DuckTwelve: nope
[1:21:57] kirk_hunts: if there wasn't petri's in hardcore it wouldn't exist. Petri's ruined hardcore is a bad take imo
[1:21:57] kilo591: Is it really hard-core if you cam still petri?
[1:21:57] yokoishealin: petricore
[1:21:58] PocketLotion: imagine if they didn’t petri
[1:22:01] t1isokatleague: no
[1:22:01] Royal_Mail: Nah
[1:22:01] MrPankratz: no
[1:22:02] madwonder: no
[1:22:02] The_Crane: No
[1:22:03] realandtruephobe: Would be pretty crazy without Petris
[1:22:04] SpaceCowboy0811: no
[1:22:05] cptmaxxmayne: yes
[1:22:05] Mr_GoG0: no
[1:22:05] Zuldandi: nah
[1:22:13] espi: raiding wouldn't exist in HC without petri
[1:22:14] Dewblus: nope
[1:22:14] gmar_07: 3 died
[1:22:14] Outmageousx: no
[1:22:14] smazex: nooo
[1:22:15] dycegamer: Yes, absolutely
[1:22:15] thisisbrettt: I do
[1:22:16] MonkeyOverlord: This is diablo 4 level of hardcore with the potion that lets you screw up
[1:22:17] cameron2o9: Nah petri ruins it
[1:22:17] melvinguyy: i would never play hardcore, but watching it is very entertaining
[1:22:18] Deceasedcheeks: They should at least have a chance to fail lol
[1:22:18] kamwryn: u spend 1k hours and decide
[1:22:19] thisisbrettt: it was in the game
[1:22:19] r4men_noodle: SSF will help that a bit
[1:22:20] kirk_hunts: If not for petri's HC wouldn't exist
[1:22:20] smazex: kill them and they go agane
[1:22:20] tookotron: they should not
[1:22:21] shrektwo_ondvd: petri makes hardcore not hardcore
[1:22:22] thisisbrettt: and has always been in the game
[1:22:23] stroobzbeats: Idk after doing a lot of HC raids, the amount of time Ive put into it, I love me a petri
[1:22:23] yokoishealin: its tough
[1:22:23] breezegodd: they never get to that raid without petris
[1:22:30] espi: too easy to grief HC, petri is necessary
[1:22:30] luckdog55: If Petris didnt' work like they do now, HC would of either died already or there would just be no raids at all
[1:22:31] Zacrilioth: if petri didnt exist no one would push hard raiding
[1:22:31] winsong: i would say if petri didn't exist many of the hc accomplisments at this point would never hav happened
[1:22:32] dycegamer: Without petri, very little people would ever raid
[1:22:32] realandtruephobe: A raid wipe should result in many deaths
[1:22:34] Teokin: I think there needs to be a petri cooldown - I think it needs to be a huge 1 week cooldown or something
[1:22:37] gdkpgold: to even out the odds with tinyviolin around
[1:22:38] SnewpDawg: My arguement for petris is that there are so many bugs and things where the game griefs you
[1:22:43] Riv_VK: the defense of petri is equal to other HC modes in other games tho even tho it is pretty cheese
[1:22:44] sengip: whats the arguement FOR petri's? It literally makes Hardcore not hardcore lol
[1:22:45] Zacrilioth: without a petri no one would want to raid lol
[1:22:46] preacherskid93: tanks should get a different type of petri
[1:22:47] geminuspr: @Xaryu mage death same raid bit earlier REALLY FUNNY https://clips.twitch.tv/GiantStylishZebraRiPepperonis-OdQWy-v-rqTw2XPh
[1:22:48] acaciashrub: petri not the problem, it’s the petri-leavegroup-tele shit that’s hella wack
[1:22:49] andypandynz: imagine no petri = no raids fully clearedand it would still be hype today but its not cause petri makes it easy
[1:22:50] thisisbrettt: LOOK AT THE GUILD NAME
[1:22:55] acaciashrub: need to get rid of leave group tele
[1:22:56] cameron2o9: Its not real hardcore its just petri b4 wipe and go.again
[1:22:57] Deceasedcheeks: You represent more people tho, you're the voice of the noobs!
[1:22:59] Necrosizz: I see both sides. Comes down to what the majority wants imo
[1:23:00] thisisbrettt: PETRI ON GOD
[1:23:02] Mahca_: i dont care for petris but how many of them wouldve quit by now due to bs deaths without petri
[1:23:03] sengip: whats the arguement FOR petri's? It literally makes Hardcore not hardcore lol..
[1:23:03] thisisbrettt: LOLOL
[1:23:06] DiddiThe1: It would suck if s key player of the raid dc and everyone dies without petri
[1:23:06] ssbm_geo: I mean people still mess it up right
[1:23:07] sadalxx: If HC was worth watching, it would be high viewer count.
[1:23:11] lambda__function: not true
[1:23:12] dazzooker: Lost your modesty and outlook
[1:23:15] dazzooker: love*
[1:23:18] LilTaisu: yes no petri
[1:23:19] curv6: thats not accurate at all
[1:23:19] stroobzbeats: but people would have quit much faster
[1:23:20] thisisbrettt: yes they would have cleared
[1:23:21] realandtruephobe: No
[1:23:22] shrektwo_ondvd: nope
[1:23:23] curv6: no
[1:23:23] ligmalolkekw: yes
[1:23:24] Kisotope_: NO
[1:23:24] daigurren2: yes
[1:23:24] sengip: No
[1:23:24] epochnesss: Yes
[1:23:25] shrektwo_ondvd: not a CHANCE
[1:23:25] zerozuckerl: no
[1:23:25] PocketLotion: idk
[1:23:25] ctrlbeesy: yes
[1:23:25] ralphh1541: 100%
[1:23:26] WingsDub: no
[1:23:26] Vesir_1: yea
[1:23:26] espi: no
[1:23:26] PeePeeUp: yes
[1:23:26] lambda__function: yes
[1:23:26] Swoopay: ya
[1:23:27] stroobzbeats: yes
[1:23:27] thisisbrettt: yeah
[1:23:28] adam_brisbane: no
[1:23:28] Kisotope_: not even close
[1:23:29] Sancta_Simplictas: yes
[1:23:29] geminuspr: https://clips.twitch.tv/GiantStylishZebraRiPepperonis-OdQWy-v-rqTw2XPh mage tries to SOD aoe farm in AQ40
[1:23:29] LilTaisu: maybe
[1:23:29] Landotazo: yes
[1:23:29] thisisbrettt: yes 100%
[1:23:30] smazex: it would
[1:23:30] thisiswalder: maybe just have to go slower
[1:23:30] ctrlbeesy: easy
[1:23:31] Poolhaus: no
[1:23:32] txboot: y
[1:23:32] scholarlywho: yes. if not everyone would have gave up by now
[1:23:32] The_Crane: Petri makes any accomplishement waaaay less impressive
[1:23:33] thesirganks: yes 1000%
[1:23:34] kirk_hunts: no it would be a dead game because people would have gotten completely fed up.
[1:23:36] emmie_h: no
[1:23:36] Reaperz_kinetic: @andypandynz that’s not true
[1:23:38] Landotazo: taken a lot longer but yes
[1:23:41] Varjant: yes, the first guild would have tried harder
[1:23:42] kilo591: People have opinions on things that they are not a part of all the time
[1:23:42] adam_brisbane: becaue when they wiped they would of had to relevel
[1:23:44] ctrlbeesy: i woulda cleared it solo
[1:23:45] kritikos5: would just have a 2nd roster on standby to replace
[1:23:46] zenithxo1: i think petri's are important because there's no way to 100% prevent griefing
[1:23:49] Do_Men: yes because "safety" meta would have adapted
[1:23:50] Deceasedcheeks: But the glory would be immense tho
[1:23:52] sengip: whats the arguement FOR petri's? It literally makes Hardcore not hardcore lol...............
[1:23:52] ChuDy1457: just pov: Xar is trying to do some similar content like Raw did. but different. A WoW player  as a PvPer gonna smash League of Legends ranked games xarW  ---try Poll if chat would love that idea or nah..
[1:23:53] preacherskid93: yes try hard would get it done
[1:24:02] Kisotope_: there would never be enough people alive at the same time to do the raids
[1:24:04] andypandynz: @Reaperz_kinetic it was aquick message i didnt actually mean literally not cleared yet LUL
[1:24:07] kirk_hunts: Too many deaths that aren't your fault and aren't preventable.
[1:24:18] WingsDub: as a viewer petri makes hc raiding less exciting that’s why leveling is so great to watch
[1:24:19] andypandynz: @Reaperz_kinetic more meant it would take longer + more prestige
[1:24:23] SnewpDawg: Petris in this scenario are game breaking but there are so many instances where the game bugs and causes you to die which petri can sometimes prevent when its out of your control otherwise
[1:24:25] kirk_hunts: Bugs shouldn't kill you in HC and petris are the only way to save yourself
[1:24:28] sengip: whats the arguement FOR petri's? It literally makes Hardcore not hardcore lol;
[1:24:30] angelc843: Just further proof this game was never meant to be played on hardcore. Raiding is a progression.
[1:24:31] Udenwo: It's too punishing. 200 gold worth of petris is a good punishment
[1:24:33] kilo591: Imagine if you got a prestige mount, loot, etc for being the first 5 guilds to clear a raid in HC (with no petris)
[1:24:33] espi: That would just mean griefers can wipe all raids/dungeons every time
[1:24:35] AlphonzeVII: people still die even when they petri leave group
[1:24:36] ShotFake: I think it's fine. You can die to so much bs like DCs and crashes so it balances it
[1:24:38] Kisotope_: then again, roaches sholdnt aggro mobs
[1:24:39] Lagarn: why was that pack of spiders so deadly btw?
[1:24:42] kamwryn: so u like to watch ppl die?
[1:24:45] kirk_hunts: Petri saved Xarbarian leveling on the final day!!
[1:24:46] dapussgaming: Well pally is not supposed to bubble hearth right? that is pretty much the same thing
[1:24:50] Reaperz_kinetic: @andypandynz oooooo then yeah and I actually mess with that. it should be like highly prestigious to have clear max on HC
[1:24:53] izarrita: sure but its not about ppl that lvl its about staying alive
[1:24:53] The_RightTwix: I disagree, max from liquid believes that blizzard shouldnt make changes or decisions based off the most hc and degen players because they will always do the most degen things no matter what
[1:24:53] voncline88: Hardcore should ban petris or it's not truly hardcore imo
[1:25:02] Slickk34: but they took pally bubble hearth away right?
[1:25:06] andypandynz: @Reaperz_kinetic yep, right now people clown on clears
[1:25:10] espi: @Slickk34 no
[1:25:13] voltrox1909: What happens to the last person in the party? Do they also get booted?
[1:25:14] realandtruephobe: yeah but whats the argument for why it should be in the game to begin with?
[1:25:14] dycegamer: @Xaryu So are you in favor of only top 1% HC players being able to raid? Cause casuals to semi-serious players would NEVER spend that much time to die in raids to others mistakes.
[1:25:19] Deceasedcheeks: It was in the game before it was redesigned for HC tho
[1:25:19] Gunnan22: These people aren't just raiding for the viewer experience.  They are raiding for their own enjoyment.
[1:25:21] cronetym1409: Limited in SSF
[1:25:24] gdkpgold: they made petri cause mages got iceblock
[1:25:31] Vandracon: @voncline88 and ban drinking
[1:25:33] sengip: @The_RightTwix  def a raider lol
[1:25:35] izarrita: if hardcore didnt exist petri would still exist
[1:25:39] daigurren2: good point
[1:25:41] espi: Without petris you couldn't do any content because of griefing
[1:25:42] kirk_hunts: The argument for petri is the game bugs out and the only way to save yourself when the game tries to kill you in a way that is unintended is a petri.
[1:25:42] Landotazo: @dycegamer what is your point? casuals won't raid hc anyways
[1:25:44] humbesaki: @dycegamer why even play hardcore as casual LUL
[1:25:51] voncline88: @Vandracon facetious hyperbole
[1:25:52] Slickk34: @espi thats good! must have just been the addon version i played
[1:25:59] e7icarium: love how people who never raided in hc are against petris like their opinions matter at all
[1:26:07] mylittlehombre: yup
[1:26:08] izarrita: agreed 100%
[1:26:14] Scholow: totally right
[1:26:20] andypandynz: @dycegamer I PAY $15 A MONTH I DESERVE TO CLEAR THE WHOLE GAME!!
[1:26:28] Kisotope_: @humbesaki it really helps to learn the game mechanics when you have to go again all the time
[1:26:37] AMLoogi: i dont understand why ppl would care if other ppl use petri
[1:26:44] Royal_Mail: Won't Selffound limit the Petri situation?
[1:26:46] Skaxxx: After 350+ hours and raiding in HC, petris are fine, they are not fail-proof and prolong the longevity of characters and even enables endgame content altogether
[1:26:47] preacherskid93: what happened to your barbarian I saw on YouTube
[1:26:48] cronetym1409: Petri will be limited in SSF
[1:26:50] mylittlehombre: when you don’t play a lot of hc then you play again you off your game
[1:26:53] kirk_hunts: We were doing mage pulls last night and Sardaco said probably not on self found
[1:26:54] kilo591: If only that logic was applied to politics
[1:26:56] izarrita: petris wouldnt matter if hc didnt exist but it does so it does
[1:26:58] BrewTTV: Classic Mage song
[1:27:00] sheepown: its hard to justify something that is antithetical to the game mode.  ask this, would blizzard add petris to the game mode if they didnt exist? i think that would be highly unlikely
[1:27:02] Varjant: cranius is the goat
[1:27:03] Zuldandi: best wow song
[1:27:03] kotuija: CLASSIC
[1:27:05] Blu_Phoenix: thats a classic for sure
[1:27:09] MonkeyOverlord: no way a classic mage main didn't see big blue dress
[1:27:18] AYOW1LL: how have you never seen this
[1:27:19] Dewblus: truuu @izarrita
[1:27:21] bearfukuu: I think that many people are tired of leveling after SoD, so most likely a huge drop-off
[1:27:32] Blu_Phoenix: one of my favs from back in the day
[1:27:32] jakaupr: coxJam
[1:27:33] PocketLotion: this man’s voice is amazing
[1:27:33] Varjant: Varjant subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[1:27:35] andypandynz: @sheepown hardcore games have saves from dying its pretty normal
[1:27:36] t1isokatleague: LOL
[1:27:36] Nightfocus: I still don't understand  why people are so happy about selffound , i play HC  and play since Release WoW , so really NO IDEA
[1:27:45] PaperbackWritter: 15 years ago is like 1995  what we talking about Sadge
[1:27:46] jakaupr: Its a classic
[1:27:54] pixelatedfrodo: the music is def 2004
[1:28:03] killrog__: hahaha these classic videos they were making 15 years ago were so good hahaha
[1:28:03] fischerlol: We are already hitting for 1200 at level 40
[1:28:15] izarrita: ppl that raid weekly on hc and ppl are crying about petris, get good or at least get good
[1:28:17] lkhemicall: OMG I REMEMBER THIS
[1:28:20] Kilrathal: This video is THE reason i even made a mage.
[1:28:21] Dewblus: fucking cheesy nerdy shit bro lol
[1:28:22] taylorsdank: LOL
[1:28:23] Slickk34: lol

[2:22:59] flaya03: you can shatter on the frostbite procs
[2:23:01] AlphonzeVII: Xaryu you should do ice lance for STV if you're running Chrono to off heal. Spec into Frost Channeling and it takes 50 mana off of Chrono
[2:23:06] Muckbot1: He healed like 45% in one heal there
[2:23:16] Reaperz_kinetic: @krookz77 youre prob a warrior

[2:38:23] ikerislock: I'm sober and this is full of bad takes lol
[2:38:32] IamTheBody: more people die from smoking vodka than drinking weed
[2:38:32] andypandynz: @Lofty916 damn u cant even stay on topic :(
[2:38:33] Reaperz_kinetic: @krookz77 the fact you dont know what that means is sad tbh
[2:38:34] the_naes94: i only got 200 every 30min xD
[2:38:34] wrogDG: Sober people just want sober to be cool lol copium to the max
[2:38:43] sheepown: govt tried to ban alcohol.  didnt work.   better to live with it and promote safe/healthy use than to ban.   thats been proven time and time again
[2:38:48] xBuffDaddyx: 5 mage got me 1500 coins 1 run
[2:38:49] andypandynz: @Lofty916 imagine thinking defending weed means u smokeit LUL i hate people like u
[2:38:53] Kisotope_: This is really the "spoon makes ppl fat" argument
[2:39:07] RudyRube: i
[2:39:12] krookz77: @Reaperz_kinetic im just dragging this out at this point to see how long youll sit here and look for reactions youre just easy honestly
[2:39:14] biiestily: did you have problems with layering in your group?
[2:39:15] sp00ookiest: well I can’t play my gameboy advance and drive, so I guess that should be illegal
[2:39:22] Nellz3r: @Xaryu can you share your WA for ice lance procs?
[2:39:26] pockets519: how close are you to mount?
[2:39:31] isleswitch: target the blood god and read his name backwards for easter egg
[2:39:35] ikerislock: Weed kills, everyone knows this
[2:39:37] ikerislock: Lol
[2:39:40] gstn86: do you have a cherry red keyboard, or what type is it? sounds crisp
[2:39:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @krookz77 says the guy who keeps responding in paragraphs KEKW.. youre easy man
[2:39:46] andypandynz: @Kisotope_ thats a good one pretty much all thatneeds to be said lol
[2:39:52] KosmicDevil_: @pockets519 hes like 30 silver or so off
[2:40:03] NAT0_141: re buff
[2:40:07] PaxedUP: Having to respawn and rebuff is painful in this event
[2:40:10] Kisotope_: @andypandynz thanks lol :)
[2:40:10] mastodonftw: some of these arguements defending smoking weed are just so pathetic
[2:40:14] xyth_alispera: Yo xaryu you can get up on those walls next to altar and be safe from melee I use that strat to get some serious coins
[2:40:15] inspect4: @reaperz_kinetic every time i turn here u r arguin about smth like 16 yo. Relax a bit
[2:40:17] numblezzz: i love twitch chat arguments that reduce down to 2 spergs absolutely needing to have the last word
[2:40:29] wrogDG: The fact you think weed is bad is pathetic. Wake up
[2:40:34] Erwincrates: it's either R1 frostball doesn't have the same proc % or there's a limit of procs per time interval
[2:40:45] krookz77: @Reaperz_kinetic oh my bad i see all ur channel badges a true hog rider you got it dog
[2:41:00] TH0TFUL: Are we just randomly calling out weed when there are things that kill way more???
[2:41:10] lusidee123: people are free to do so as they please, you trying to tear people down and forcing your opinion is whats truely pathetic
[2:41:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @krookz77 and now you gotta change the subject KEKW moved from projecting to deflecting
[2:41:13] TH0TFUL: Just dont smoke it ez lol
[2:41:15] krookz77: @Reaperz_kinetic ill stop now
[2:41:20] Kisotope_: @TH0TFUL seems to be that way, yeah

[2:44:45] neoseoul69: 420
[2:44:49] sauceboifredo: I just think it’s goofy
[2:44:52] jeneraljelly: @Erwincrates this event is rough for melee even with no lag
[2:44:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @wrogDG people are incapable of that which is Weirdge
[2:45:02] taylorsdank: @sauceboifredo pretty childish of you, good thing this is a family friendly stream!
[2:45:14] realandtruephobe: This event is a pretty damn good way to farm honor. 10x your blood coins in honor if you buy it
[2:45:16] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank KEKW that was smooth
[2:45:17] Eggzactly54: @jeneraljelly this phase is rough period for melee
[2:45:24] WHOisTHePianoMan: @taylorsdank xarKEK

[2:45:56] Eggzactly54: @Riverxlol hahaha agreed
[2:45:57] Erwincrates: I think you can't get that fear dispelled, red square
[2:46:28] andypandynz: @PaxedUP reinventing the wheel for no reason
[2:47:16] D3KHAR: Was unplayable yesterday too
[2:47:17] hemperorpalpatine: monekyfoot sounds like some decrepit disease
[2:47:19] eldyraw: its server wide
[2:47:21] itsquetzy: only way you could dispel that is with paladin bop
[2:47:23] evil_tree: What happens if you kill the boss? any loot?
[2:47:23] bullbabear: just throw an aoe on that loa lol
[2:47:32] Scoffered: Cant dispel
[2:47:32] sumthinclevr: Yes you are
[2:47:33] Templetacos: hey its Brucewaye hunter next to you!
[2:47:33] yottzilla: you can
[2:47:34] flucky90: ya you cant dispel
[2:47:38] sumthinclevr: iit's a physical spell not magic
[2:47:40] Lanolinlol: its a terrify not a fear
[2:47:45] realPend: The duration is instantaneous, so it can't be dispelled. The effect is 'stunned' so no spells can remove it or prevent it and only major magical artifacts can even prevent it.
[2:47:45] LJimbox: yep, cant dispell it in classic
[2:47:50] LJimbox: but in retail, yes
[2:47:50] Kpizx: was unplayable for us yesterday but because our group was on 3 different layers and it kept swapping randomly
[2:47:51] sumthinclevr: it can be removed by Tremor/Trinket though....
[2:47:58] itsquetzy: @Xaryu paladin bop takes it off
[2:48:01] hemperorpalpatine: retail andy
[2:48:01] sunshinewine: is teleporting a new rune?
[2:48:12] PaxedUP: @andypandynz how so?
[2:48:38] Erwincrates: AS far as  I know debuffs with a red square are not removable unless you block, the priest fear becomes magic (blue) in TBC
[2:48:43] bryn_dee: Weird when you're listening to audio only and it goes from complete chaos to spirit realm silence
[2:48:48] Zecxx: full kamikaze mage groups are hilarious
[2:48:49] hemperorpalpatine: @sunshinewine its okay mate i got the joke even if he didnt
[2:48:52] rainydaydaydream: ive had to break from stv event cause lag is unplayable
[2:48:57] ngl85: morning all Kappa Kappa Kappa

[2:49:45] Mastapenguino: friday
[2:49:47] jeneraljelly: @nikola420tesla those all effect the integrity of the event lol
[2:49:48] Erwincrates: Maybe because they're having some pve competition in retail and all the engines are being used for that
[2:49:52] thesack3: Having 10 layers was worse than the lag
[2:49:54] Weedweed: dudes still thinking Microsoft Blizzard is a good company in 2024
[2:49:54] auuzib: There is definitely layers lol
[2:49:56] Steiny1784: do you think student fodders will work in p3?

[2:50:08] warrndu: PEAK content
[2:50:08] gamedemon010: The engine is old and retail engine is not made for large scale pvp
[2:50:10] hiro25000: if you are on a fuill layer it is laggy. But some layers are ok
[2:50:26] Kpizx: what’s worse - the lag or not being able to see your group members because you’re all on different layers
[2:50:29] gamedemon010: that's why instanced pvp exist
[2:51:21] chr47: This event is awesome, but they are having big problems with the layering
[2:51:27] LiamTheLioness: think it depends on layers cuz mine is ok
[2:51:28] espi: @Xaryu its Friday
[2:51:30] dashboarddaily: its friday my boy more people
[2:51:31] TheoDeri: its friday
[2:51:34] Eggzactly54: its friday. probably higher pop
[2:51:35] erok01: something weird happened. never had lag like this before
[2:51:37] JNSMAX: Maybe just more people on a weekend
[2:51:39] Hirshberg: didnt they say they were going to be removing some layers?
[2:51:43] gamedemon010: its not something players hit 40 and its weekend
[2:51:48] yottzilla: they had an issue yesterday afternoon with party members layering from each other
[2:51:48] warrndu: @Hirshberg This
[2:51:50] pachosol: I hope xaryu is is in the ahmpy server its gonna be funny
[2:51:55] PaxedUP: @andypandynz are you recommending using body weight for load as opposed to using a thing and a thing?
[2:51:56] xqooq: hi
[2:52:01] barns20: yeah the layering is a huge issue. tried to do stv 3 different times yesterday and couldn't stay on a layer with more the 2 other teammates
[2:52:02] Nightmareo: gotta get down on Friday Kappa
[2:52:04] Mastapenguino: europes already Friday night chillin
[2:52:10] oTrems: Its been this laggy for me every event idk, it’s either the lag or the layers always one or the other
[2:52:12] Lanolinlol: PepeWhy
[2:52:13] exizee: yea it is
[2:52:14] DeathToad007: yes
[2:52:16] h0t_sauce7: yes
[2:52:16] Kisotope_: yes
[2:52:17] chr47: wrong choice
[2:52:20] Zuldandi: wrong
[2:52:21] Nightmareo: yes
[2:52:22] exizee: stv on dead layer makes 0 sense
[2:52:22] DeathToad007: it is
[2:52:22] cro_damir: yes
[2:52:23] The_Crane: Yes. Event is only 1 part of the game
[2:52:24] gamedemon010: Yes is right choice
[2:52:25] Ervill1: right choice
[2:52:26] Psyphin808: yes
[2:52:26] adam_brisbane: yes
[2:52:27] hiro25000: No
[2:52:27] TheoDeri: mans a philosopher now
[2:52:27] spleen_eater: yes
[2:52:27] gamedemon010: rather have lag
[2:52:30] jeneraljelly: Event sucks anyway
[2:52:30] beccaria21: W choice
[2:52:30] thesack3: I'll take lag over dead world
[2:52:31] notjayrip: right choice
[2:52:31] handovdoom666: yes. everyone is in the world. only a percentage play pvp
[2:52:31] andypandynz: @PaxedUP yes but also can just hold things like milk if ur doing at home, calvesrespond to bigstretching not massive weight
[2:52:31] jeneraljelly: gg
[2:52:32] Casualkev91: can you do a wand 360 fadeaway again - maybe in the pvp event? like Shannon did? =D i laughed so hard back then hehe
[2:52:33] WHOisTHePianoMan: i think its the right choice
[2:52:34] disar27: agree
[2:52:34] NAT0_141: prefer lag. if you have no lag but no people then where’s the event?
[2:52:36] DeathToad007: istv is a single aspect
[2:52:39] gamedemon010: wold felt empty with layers
[2:52:40] iRambo96: wrong choice, you need performance in a pvp event, lag is not it
[2:52:41] TheKaveman: the world needs to feel alive, whole pull of classic
[2:52:43] exizee: why would you farm stv on a dead layer
[2:52:44] The_Crane: Making the whole game dead to make 1 event better is not the play
[2:52:45] cls33: if dead world then no stv, right?
[2:52:45] scoutbeans: but as a pvper, you want the rest of the world to feel alive. not just STV every three hours
[2:52:46] KosmicDevil_: i like the chaos
[2:52:46] chr47: there is no content but the STV event at the moment even if you quest, busy layers suck
[2:52:50] mikuxest: Yes, if otherwise you're playing in single player mode 95% of the time
[2:52:57] tangerinegrass: not at any point in sod p2 has the world felt dead common blizzard L
[2:52:58] yottzilla: rather have lag than be separated from party members
[2:52:58] DeathToad007: sacrificing a whole server interaction for one pvp even is a wrong design choice
[2:52:58] andypandynz: @PaxedUP fitness industry is just scams and money like anything else, up to u if uwant it but majority ofthat shit is agimmick
[2:52:59] Zecxx: cant they scale up the layers when STV event starts, and scale back down afterwards?
[2:53:02] thesack3: Last event layering was so bad I couldn't even see my own team
[2:53:08] AntDawgThaBoss: i mean if your on a pvp realm i think it makes more sense to make the world PvP event better
[2:53:13] PhoenixPresence: @andypandynz like maybe 85% of it
[2:53:16] beeeVAL: wouldnt it only be a dead world for 30 min? if most people are in stv it should feel dead either way
[2:53:22] Casualkev91: can you do a wand 360 fadeaway again - maybe in the pvp event? like Shannon did? =D i laughed so hard back then hehe
[2:53:25] realandtruephobe: Xar you going to save for mount or buy to max honor?
[2:53:26] Zuldandi: thats why its the wrong choice imo
[2:53:31] mt2k6: My server isnt lagging at the PvP event
[2:53:38] iRambo96: Why don't they make the event like a Wintergrasp type phasing?
[2:53:38] The_Crane: The world being alive is the most important thing. The event is 1 small part of the game
[2:53:38] davisonxxd: have it instanced
[2:53:42] DeathToad007: maybe its your starforge?
[2:53:46] skimansr: malcolm
[2:53:48] PhoenixPresence: whats the lagging from
[2:53:48] mas13t: this is hardly pvp with the lag
[2:53:52] AdamAnt7: thats there fault for making this event shit lag
[2:53:53] blazzedzz: Glad I don't play on the mega server lol
[2:53:56] Eggzactly54: @skimansr lol i see whatcha did there
[2:53:59] sushileafbeats: good thing you have a starforge pc @Xaryu
[2:54:03] Tantetango: @Xaryu Will you ever try to kill the boss ? :D
[2:54:12] skimansr: @Eggzactly54 :)
[2:54:13] lukemeleney: @skimansr Cranston's best role?
[2:54:13] iRambo96: @Xaryu can they not duplicate a Wintergrasp environment?
[2:54:14] mikuxest: Have you watched the Payo Season of Layers video?
[2:54:20] inhaledthc: indeed
[2:54:20] Waggzy: Taco Bell or Taco John's? 🌮
[2:54:25] itsSooon: you cant he heals on attack
[2:54:28] The_Crane: I'd rather 95% of the game feel alive and have 5% of it lag
[2:54:32] PhoenixPresence: oh theres like 10000 people thats why lol
[2:54:37] AdamAnt7: to many layers
[2:54:39] RudyRube: @mikuxest that video is prob why they reverted it lol
[2:54:40] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: make a guess
[2:54:44] sushileafbeats: The boss heals like 1k on each kill, and has the health of a naxx boss.
[2:54:48] NAT0_141: @waggzy Taco Time up in WA is best
[2:54:55] PhoenixPresence: @The_Crane thats not necessarily how it works
[2:54:55] andypandynz: payo ddossed staysafe andstill has a platform LUL
[2:54:56] rustyjeep: odd, we dont see this issue on Lavalash
[2:55:02] Weedweed: this some Private Server type of shit
[2:55:04] mikuxest: Payo walking around in an empty world, not a player around besides in org
[2:55:09] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu i feel like they removed some of the ressers too
[2:55:10] realandtruephobe: people who weren't playing STV were unhappy with how quiet the world seemed with their fix so they switched it back
[2:55:12] blazzedzz: Payo said he has no content if the world is dead
[2:55:13] StunningPaul: they changed the static spirit rezzers as people were just spawning and aoe'ing altar. They now roam around
[2:55:17] t1isokatleague: only ur lagging
[2:55:18] doctor_anoos: Playing as melee in this shit is absolutely fucking pepega.
[2:55:20] Hirshberg: LOL
[2:55:21] PhoenixPresence: kinda see why youre lagging though with that many hordr
[2:55:22] Kisotope_: is it not possible to have layers set up for different time periods? i.e. open more layers during peak times? and have it automated?
[2:55:23] erok01: lol
[2:55:24] isleswitch: read the boss back wards Xaryu
[2:55:24] batchestspam: LMFAOOOOOOOO
[2:55:24] Sp00kedEu: sniped
[2:55:25] erok01: cool game
[2:55:26] Lifeles85: lol
[2:55:28] batchestspam: BLIZZAAAAAAAAARRRRDDDDD
[2:55:30] JuggaBugga: dont you only get the immunity when yo rez at spriit healer?
[2:55:30] Lanolinlol: NOOOO
[2:55:31] perrywinkll: lol
[2:55:32] HoppsAlot: Looks like you need to survive for 2 seconds before it kicks in
[2:55:36] ralphh1541: lag
[2:55:37] Reaperz_kinetic: because you body rezzed
[2:55:38] The_Crane: @phoenixpresence it's a huge part of it. Making lots of layers fixes the event but makes 90% of the zones feel empty
[2:55:38] zeddinael: @Xaryu that happened to me twice. You need to turn off the game.
[2:55:39] t3hfluff: Because you're rez at body
[2:55:43] PaxedUP: you dont get immunity from body rez. just respawn 1/2 hp/mp for no reason
[2:55:45] chobinhood_: @JuggaBugga no thats not true
[2:55:47] gmar_07: cant they just split the server only during the stv event times
[2:55:51] realPend: @JuggaBugga Nah also at body
[2:55:54] ybadmind: U do get it body rez
[2:55:57] AdamAnt7: you dont get immune fro body res
[2:55:59] sushileafbeats: you do get immunity on body
[2:56:00] 1cyveins: nopt always
[2:56:03] gamedemon010: Bro i still need 2 coins i am happy i don't have to do this
[2:56:04] PhoenixPresence: is there another streamer on horde rn? soo many ppl
[2:56:05] chobinhood_: chat with the misinformation
[2:56:05] Mico027: You still can get CC'd
[2:56:08] gamedemon010: i just get my coins and gfto
[2:56:13] realandtruephobe: @AdamAnt7 This hasn't been the case the whole p2
[2:56:13] JuggaBugga: @realPend good to know ty!
[2:56:14] ybadmind: I got immunity yesterday body reading
[2:56:17] Apemint: you even get immunity on anhk...

[2:56:27] AdamAnt7: @whitewatersalvo wrong
[2:56:27] Yson24: ¸how does this event work ive never played it yet
[2:56:30] lukemeleney: I think you go in, you AoE, you ice block and pray
[2:56:32] cobananas: you took fall damage and the buff fell off
[2:56:34] holapirri12: rip bloods
[2:56:40] holapirri12: pacified
[2:56:41] Nimbus723: isn't it always better to spirit rez since you start with full health and mana?
[2:56:42] The_Crane: Can you actually kill that boss?
[2:56:50] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: its not an instance
[2:56:50] erok01: 100%
[2:56:54] JuggaBugga: you got it that time LOL
[2:56:55] adam_brisbane: Panda so cute
[2:56:56] Ervill1: Aware
[2:57:07] B_Rize: this is so scuffed lol
[2:57:14] gamedemon010: what is the 30 min debuff  ?

[2:57:41] adam_brisbane: you died to a pve boss
[2:57:43] Kisotope_: @xaryu sorry bro :( we know how hyped you get when its not laggy
[2:57:45] pugrootbeer: Was really bad yesterday at 3 pm
[2:57:47] AdamAnt7: @whitewatersalvo no you are wrong

[2:58:30] AdamAnt7: @whitewatersalvo no your comment about whole phase two is wrong..i knw its hard to be that wrong
[2:58:33] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu more and more people are hitting 40 and coming out too...
[2:58:38] Tinkeyyyy: Can they not layer just the STV zone?
[2:58:40] Brophizzle: @Xaryu if when I die, God tells me I can reincarnate as anyone I want, would you recommend yourself?
[2:58:42] StunningPaul: if you're aoe'ing altar --- do some aoe's and then iceblock -- you'll get bloods while blocked next to altar
[2:58:42] ObeySpite: im not lagging at all in my event
[2:58:51] KairuruTV: smaller servers dont lag much
[2:58:54] PhoenixPresence: so payo season of layers, is it llayering once they reach a certain amount of people in the event?

[2:59:31] arkddwn: Dont things tend to be laggy when you've got most likely over 100-200 people in one area trying to do things?
[2:59:34] JNSMAX: that's what she said
[2:59:36] inhaledthc: did they remove the layers

[3:00:40] gstn86: what’s your keyboard Xar? sounds crisp
[3:00:51] yohadue: yo @Xaryu i just bought your bodyweight program.  what do you think is the best way to get started with handstands?

[3:02:33] dulgr_1: @Xaryu  If u ever played osrs I would do raids w/ you
[3:02:40] Eskanel: I feel like you'd be a great OSRS streamer because you're really good at conversing with chat, OSRS is definitely a speak with the chat kinda game
[3:02:41] putroh: @whitewatersalvo probably a person opted out of the event, but attackable because of opposite faction
[3:02:44] PhoenixPresence: XarMom in the chat
[3:02:51] jakaupr: We wont say anything
[3:02:53] robertoox92: call her

[3:03:28] JuggaBugga: the COC takes forever to register the hit lol
[3:03:28] PhoenixPresence: lolol
[3:03:33] NAT0_141: ice lance build looks fun. just instant proc on the move
[3:03:37] CptBananaBits: @Xaryu I'd love to see a hardcore Ironman OSRS playthrough by you
[3:03:37] hot_souffle: its a bloodbath
[3:03:46] itsrayray3: KEKW
[3:03:47] lichskunk74: lol
[3:03:49] Lanolinlol: \ D: ?
[3:03:49] dalvasorsali: cause you're the real boss
[3:03:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @yohadue basically practice just basic handstands and then make sure that you can overhead press your bodyweight and then start trying to learn the handstand pushups
[3:03:57] adam_brisbane: bruised 2 times now
[3:03:58] Fufflarn: 4430 KEKW
[3:03:58] PhoenixPresence: wrekt

[3:05:21] drummond777: why cant they just change it to only be more layers in stv?
[3:05:21] khazuqi: from possibly one of the best this far to a disaster LUL
[3:05:22] HoppsAlot: But for now...
[3:05:31] PhoenixPresence: Why cant STV itself have more layers then the rest of the world
[3:05:32] Detcob: should be like WG
[3:05:32] melvinguyy: maybe just layer in stv
[3:05:32] Kisotope_: @xaryu they need to make the layering fluid based on population breakpoints

[3:21:36] Shenko_TM: Yo Xar! Black coffee or white coffee???
[3:21:37] Landotazo: @Xaryu to add to the dmg+heals, the math behind is prolly something like sacrificing 5-10% raid-wide dmg while inc raid healing by 25% or something
[3:21:38] PhoenixPresence: calcium carbonate= carbonation = calcification of hypothalamus and other important hormone sites
[3:21:39] AlphonzeVII: no..the spec you're playing is very normal for healing mage

[3:21:54] xTravvvvv: so do you think your 250 dps with 10-0 hps is more worth than if you were doing 400 as fire and the bosses were dieing quicker?

[3:29:40] SurrealAndre: @Sailor_Coom if you haven't played horde enough maybe you just dont see some things are very specific to ally behavior
[3:29:40] boobaoogabooga: Being able to get an epic from a single run is just wrong
[3:29:53] Zorgggg: can u show spec and is ice lance bis now?
[3:29:56] PhoenixPresence: any ttips for bag organization? as acrafter im amazed how simple u have ur setup
[3:29:58] Lemonsquezee: What stops guilds from helping each other even if not in a group together ?
[3:30:03] LueDawg: @Sailor_Coom lol yup, there's smol PP dickheads on both sides
[3:30:05] wavecadet: @boobaoogabooga you absoultely can get 5 silver coins in 1 run lol
[3:30:05] Denzax: Does anyone know when the faction imbalance updates? Im trying to play alliance on living flame EU but it doesn't let me
[3:30:06] gzxgvr: gzxgvr subscribed with Prime.

[3:30:16] shalomski: @xaryu , have you done all 4 now?
[3:30:16] Kisotope_: @SurrealAndre i play alliance and find generally they are cowards
[3:30:17] bigxukdog: they need people to play ton of chars - its also NOT end game
[3:30:17] Pilky02: its good, i dont like the event so i would hate to have to farm it
[3:30:19] Lemonsquezee: What stops guilds from helping each other even if not in a group together ? @Xaryu
[3:30:20] boobaoogabooga: @wavecadet what I mean is it shouldnt be this way
[3:30:21] auroris9: Casuals are getting like 3-5 usually 😆
[3:30:22] realandtruephobe: you usually skip the 3pm one
[3:30:24] PhoenixPresence: @boobaoogabooga yeah thats not v classic tru
[3:30:25] Muckbot1: You missed 1 yesterday KEKW
[3:30:26] GaithRL: Is there a setting or an addon for the flight time being shown on the screen? I don't have that
[3:30:27] cmilly1025: But those epics aren't over powered
[3:30:29] yellowgaiden: thats not even half
[3:30:34] bullbabear: I’m so bad at pvp so im getting like 3 silver max lol
[3:30:41] itsSteamo: is rep tokens or just the lumber turn ins bro?
[3:30:46] PhoenixPresence: epics were v uncommon before 60 in vanilla
[3:30:48] tigerslap_ow: what is this flight timer addon?
[3:30:58] SurrealAndre: @Kisotope_ I would say horde are more insecure bullies, ally are more coward behavior
[3:31:00] LueDawg: depends on the lag really
[3:31:07] wiss1807: How much is STV weapon?
[3:31:09] cbaily7: Id that mount faster than the purchased one?
[3:31:09] Synthez542: Just get in a group of 5, dot everything that you can and stay alive
[3:31:09] Am0n3r: I think its your PC
[3:31:09] peter_pipe_her_: @Xaryu do you think its too late for new people to join SoD and catch up to others?
[3:31:12] xXxBarlogxXx: I just wish my class had more to get from there, not a ton for tank sham
[3:31:15] adam_brisbane: are you sollar @bullbabear
[3:31:18] sushileafbeats: i mean i bought my epic in 2 events, 40 min of my time. gg ez. thats as a casual
[3:31:19] Kisotope_: @SurrealAndre 100% agree im my experience so far
[3:31:19] adam_brisbane: solo
[3:31:21] ddevillax: for me its not the lag, its the layers
[3:31:23] hannahbizzle: never too late
[3:31:24] LeBertTheTurtle: im shocked you had lag. I just did it and mine was fine
[3:31:24] Bigde123: my motivation to do it after the lag have put me out of it totally
[3:31:29] Am0n3r: @Xaryu Ask Starforge to provide better PCs for Blizzard
[3:31:31] Bigde123: haven't done it for like 2weeks
[3:31:33] Lemonsquezee: What stops guilds from helping each other even if not in a group together ? @Xaryu 󠀀
[3:31:36] EnigmaticHD: why would it change between now and 3?
[3:31:38] Zorgggg: can u show spec and runes ?
[3:31:41] taylorsdank: for people not lagging are you on less populated realms?
[3:31:48] starbuggwest: blizzard you have 14 days to fix your event
[3:31:49] willcantstream: new spec?
[3:31:50] EnigmaticHD: I would manage expectations obv
[3:31:51] inhaledthc: i agree
[3:31:57] bizkitz_gaming: just did one and it was terrible lol
[3:32:14] Yamamoto78: "they fixed the lag" aka ppl stopped doing the event so its less populated
[3:32:18] Fluiji: nothing like running across the map to get to the boss, then getting layered
[3:32:19] hersftw: @Xaryu are you hyped for HCSF next week?
[3:32:23] blazzedzz: Sucks people feel forced to play on Maga servers event is fine on off meta servers
[3:32:26] tdizziie: Lag on EU living flame last week was terrible but it's been absolutely fine the last 4-5 days
[3:32:29] kirk_hunts: are you getting the arcane wand from mage quest?
[3:32:31] Yeddamand: I think they removed some of the layering, because the overworld was WAY more populated yesterday
[3:32:40] antmd15: It's weird how it is fine then the next event it can be terrible it. It's not even bc of the amount of players it seems random
[3:32:43] shalomski: @xaryu where are you going?
[3:32:48] AlphonzeVII: so many of mage's runes not working properly
[3:32:53] ka4okvit9: Does Rank 1 spells have higher chance to resist campring to Rank 5 spell?
[3:32:56] kirk_hunts: I am experiencing the same thing
[3:32:56] Degran: ICD?
[3:32:57] realandtruephobe: So if they added, youd be at 50% proc chance
[3:32:59] lichskunk74: sounds legit
[3:32:59] weeedzygg: @Xaryu the problem is finger of frost only happens on frostbite
[3:33:00] AlphonzeVII: spell power wasnt stacking with ice shards
[3:33:02] inspect4: if u roll on the mega server and act suprised when theres lag its 100% on u
[3:33:08] weeedzygg: @Xaryu so it doesnt even matter much
[3:33:08] Pingulini: @ka4okvit9 no, thats based on resistances and level
[3:33:13] b58dan: @inspect4 terrible take lmfao
[3:33:16] dramajohns: fingers and frostbite procs together. which is intended
[3:33:19] willcantstream: how would you rank mage for duels in p2?
[3:33:22] kirk_hunts: even on max rank frost bolt I don't feel liek I'm getting the right procs
[3:33:22] provender_: Test it with higher rank spell @xaryu
[3:33:23] fireflower5: what’s the probability that all three happen at the same time? what’s the probably that AT LEAST one of the three happens?
[3:33:24] AlphonzeVII: if you shatter combo with spell power now you can hit 1500
[3:33:24] lion_the_ryan: i mean i tested with r1 frostbolt 150 times and it was 19.8%
[3:33:28] Pete_Starr: hair cut is looking fresh big dog @Xaryu
[3:33:28] b58dan: lone wolf isnt a mega server and it lags. its a bug. @inspect4
[3:33:30] notatallnope: HI XAR!
[3:33:35] isleswitch: its prob bbugged cause in WOTLK its 15% proc and it procs all the time
[3:33:36] Yamamoto78: @b58dan hes right
[3:33:36] realandtruephobe: Should be 1/2
[3:33:38] lichskunk74: pay to win RNG
[3:33:39] b58dan: @Yamamoto78 he isnt
[3:33:45] b58dan: @Yamamoto78 its a bug dip shit
[3:33:46] shalomski: I thought he did all 4 quadrallations?
[3:33:46] weeedzygg: @dramajohns so whats the point to have finger when frostbite? u gonna crit anyway fingers or not LUL
[3:33:52] inhaledthc: The Even is out with few layers->there is huge lag->everyone complains->the add a bunch of layers->they remove the layers(repeat)
[3:33:52] Am0n3r: @Xaryu did Kai recognize you after the haircut?
[3:34:00] GarrettdaaaCarrot: is onyxias lair open?

[3:34:22] Am0n3r: @Xaryu the videos where dad shave off their facial hair are funny
[3:34:25] rainydaydaydream: @weeedzygg really the only way frost in raid could be viable, it isn't viable but its possible lol
[3:34:25] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: Kyle? The guy from south park?
[3:34:26] b58dan: @Yamamoto78 hes right? because a bug is causing the server to lag? are u dense?
[3:34:28] ddevillax: did u cut ur hair so u didnt have to change ur profile pic

[3:44:02] kirk_hunts: Rogue is just a single target tank
[3:44:02] ctrlbeesy: tank is like the opposite of what rogue should be
[3:44:02] provender_: The mechanical mount sounds are annoying, can’t wait for panther haha
[3:44:05] Pingulini: @jbarish what about mage dmg
[3:44:10] Kirokushin: Gnomer*
[3:44:15] kirk_hunts: rogue mitigation is actually kinda broken atm

[3:45:03] AlphonzeVII: its not really like that in bgs though
[3:45:03] Weedweed: Paid Beta Test
[3:45:03] Reaperz_kinetic: @Zorgggg added
[3:45:04] buddhistredneck: I am a healer main. I quit retail because of the TTK being too fast. This is absolutley miserable to play as a healer
[3:45:04] wavecadet: yeah they should make it so only shamans can 1 shot
[3:45:04] Grocery7: melee hunter just waddles over 2 raptor strikes, ez clap
[3:45:07] kirk_hunts: I don't do AB because it's 15 people running in a circle one shotting like chickens with their head's cut off
[3:45:08] wavecadet: just like OG classic
[3:45:10] 1shabbymn: yea when are you going to solo dungeons?
[3:45:10] xiClutchBoyix: Make stam give 1.3 or 1.5 hp, easy clap
[3:45:18] vervolts: they will have to do a resilience update like they do for many games (LoL is an example)
[3:45:20] provender_: Why not just dampen 20% across the board?
[3:45:23] gbtwisted2: @Xaryu Havent checked in a while, hows the baby doing?
[3:45:25] jcool_actsafool: I been playing since 6 months after vanilla release
[3:45:25] voidtouched_93: are you playing ssf servers?
[3:45:29] Thenewplague: ah love mages <3 :)
[3:45:38] idfk91: my mage has 1080 health in gnomer raid gear lol
[3:45:44] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu do you mean when someone kited devilsaur to you?
[3:45:45] Diabolikkgg: dampening sucks
[3:45:52] auroris9: Then the classes not 1 shotting suck too
[3:45:52] bokibremofobeast: i can roll forward
[3:45:54] Diabolikkgg: vanilla was all about 1 shotting
[3:45:56] provender_: Dampen in STV event
[3:45:56] Shake4L: yeah...
[3:45:57] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: would make raids too hard
[3:45:59] Shake4L: its fucking stupid
[3:46:02] Reaperz_kinetic: @idfk91 yeah if you wanna pvp you need to have a pvp set too
[3:46:03] ddraggbagg: A flat rate across the board also affects the classes still not performing
[3:46:08] Shunmao: finally done with my dailies
[3:46:15] KairuruTV: i wanna see them balance around pvp and then ban dps meters and then everything would be fine
[3:46:19] jcool_actsafool: I got a 56 spriest that would dunk on 60s, all SP crit gear. My dots go cray
[3:46:20] Reaperz_kinetic: @idfk91 i have 2 sets of gear one is BIS gnomer and the other is pvp gear
[3:46:22] schraler: was the damage problem the reason they implemented resilience in pvp?
[3:46:22] Ardal_Obe: I have 5k health pvp geared and still get 2-3 shot
[3:46:25] 1shabbymn: my raptor strikes hit for like 900 back to back
[3:46:25] espi: arcane blast
[3:46:25] OGTigolebitties: a little bottle cap of whiskey always helps em sleep
[3:46:27] Baeta: shamans need next nerf
[3:46:28] doomzhnwhateverrly: hydra Crit 2400 other day
[3:46:30] provender_: It doesn’t fix underperforming classes, but dampening STV event would prevent one shot meta
[3:46:31] blakebrry: had and 1080 crit from ambush in STV event
[3:46:33] podolaks: You never talk about mage lol
[3:46:35] blakebrry: today
[3:46:35] ohshituh: arcane surge for 2500 :)
[3:46:35] bigfatnerd1: they need to nerf these one shot abilities, and then nerf gnomer to make up for it. Simple. No need to change anything else in ove as dungeons are a joke with runes
[3:46:39] Reaperz_kinetic: @idfk91 actually i have 3 sets cause i have a pve fire set too
[3:46:41] The_Crane: @baeta stop
[3:46:43] kirk_hunts: I had to buy a green +18 stam chest off ah and some eagle gear to be able to survive STV on my mage
[3:46:47] lion_the_ryan: range hunter autos crit for 700
[3:46:47] plae007: Rogues can spam mutilate for 6-800 crits 3x in a row
[3:46:48] illimaattiic: minblast critting for 1k
[3:46:51] bryn_dee: @Xaryu Don't think decrease dmg done to Players in retail on some spells? Genuine question why couldn't they something like that in Classic so that is doesn't impact PVE content? Maybe i am just missing something?
[3:46:53] jcool_actsafool: My 56 sp would dunk on 60s at 56, all SP crit gear
[3:46:56] Baeta: shamans and mages on the hit list next
[3:46:57] scoutbeans: rogues are absolutely destroying me right now
[3:47:00] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu call me crazy but like i feel like rogue has kinda lost its identity now that every class bursts harder than rogues.
[3:47:00] Reaperz_kinetic: @kirk_hunts pretty much
[3:47:03] hemperorpalpatine: can warriors crit anyone?
[3:47:05] nikola420tesla: They do ??

[3:48:59] 5tolp5kott: are there diminishing returns on killing the same player?
[3:49:03] Grocery7: 2 raptor strikes = most non stam mages dead
[3:49:05] Fhirn: i hate melee hunters

[3:49:13] Deatharmor98: @ApexLegendsNewsDe System > Mute Game Sounds > Mecha
[3:49:13] Diabolikkgg: u would die
[3:49:14] Fourleaf_TV: hes hitting with both weapons at the same time
[3:49:15] adam_brisbane: lucky he did not have flanking strike up or it would of bene 10% higher

[4:23:29] splashbomb007: @xaryu  try logging out.   I farmed for 30 min - nothing.  but when I relogged - got him in 8 kills
[4:23:30] largist_: for the dark mote loging out for night helped me
[4:23:35] dan_mcpherson: people only think it does because they deleted their cahce and it dropped. 100% bet it would've dropped either way
[4:23:35] 1cyveins: YEP try it
[4:23:35] TheShazamMan: it's not bugged for everyone
[4:23:36] Ed_Gope: I think you just don't want it enough, if you really wanted it you'd have it by now
[4:23:41] swyftboi: ok
[4:23:41] wutdaflux1: i was in a party with someone who was able to loot it and i wasn't
[4:23:41] ikerislock: Its true
[4:23:43] ctrlbeesy: bald chat
[4:23:44] espi: chat he doesn't have the quest item, the NPC can't spawn until he does
[4:23:45] reallyeric: its a placebo effect
[4:23:48] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu its just like how Hunters couldnt loot their Trap Launcher rune without deleting cache. sometimes it just bugs out.
[4:23:48] PaperbackWritter: see, that is the advantage of being the last person to do this quest
[4:23:50] Spikeqc: ok
[4:23:51] Gregzoid: your cache has absolutely NO influence whatsoever on any drops ingame
[4:23:51] Goobadoobadoob: I've noticed if ppl did the last epic quest last phase they have to clear cache this phase but if you didn't you don't have to
[4:23:52] icerainz: bro i can confirm
[4:23:53] Minoeske: you can kill the naga on the north island, they drop it as well

[4:24:10] mandl: you kill Nagas for the first item
[4:24:10] Shake4L: no
[4:24:11] espi: You need a depleted core and THEN an npc will spawn from kills
[4:24:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @espi i think youre lost
[4:24:17] TheShazamMan: just kill naga screamers that is
[4:24:18] icerainz: clear cache first
[4:24:19] schnick3698: @Xaryu you can also try slash reload
[4:24:19] largist_: oh for that u just have to keep killing
[4:24:22] mandl: with that you kill every mob that gives xp until the spawn comes
[4:24:24] Reaperz_kinetic: @espi yes he knows.. hes trying to get the core rn LOL
[4:24:26] naps250: mine dropped from the 1st naga here LUL
[4:24:28] angelc843: Keep killing nagas, one will drop the item, and then another will spawn a stranger. They dropped within 10 kills for me on 2 characters on the 44 mobs

[4:45:31] fivetailfox: insta cast shouldn't instakill
[4:45:33] Gabe4D: @xaryu SW Death was nerfed so that shadow priests are still viable with it, but healer priests cant one shot ppl, and people have a chance to respond to sw death rather than being dead right away

[5:13:11] The_palumbo: if you kill the mobs in the little buildings and wait, the rares may spawn
[5:13:13] prismo5: you dont reset to get rarey in gy, it can respawn off any single mob that isnt grouped
[5:13:14] Dracconfoo: u can kill packs in there where the rares spawn and wiat and hace a chance for it to spawn @Xaryu

[5:33:06] Loodimus: ill take that over not being able to do the main event lol
[5:33:07] valkkbot: add a button on map to pull everyone to your layer....just like they do with retail and chromie time
[5:33:08] sushileafbeats: why cant they just isolate the many layers to STV?
[5:33:08] mungas1: it’s cool when you’re on the same layer then the event starts and you  start layering
[5:33:09] kokoMcgogo: ah ok since they done have zone wide layering
[5:33:10] Kisotope_: @Xaryu Automated layer addition/suubtraction based on population

[5:33:25] DontDv8: im sure its a lot to support with the capacity they allocate for sod plus being the classic version of build
[5:33:26] gmar_07: Why cant they only turn on the layer system during the STV event times
[5:33:29] bryn_dee: I couldn't find people to group w/ for group quests leveling my alt with the other layer fix but I would rather suffer on the alt than deal with shoddy layer lag issues in stv :(
[5:33:39] cory_lockman: @WipeMeD0wn there is, they just suck at implementing changes accordingly

[5:33:59] mr_choc0: there is no way to have different number of layers in each zone ?
[5:34:08] crazyt4c0: thats what they want you to think
[5:34:10] tuna_sandw1ch: kick that mage and get a new one
[5:34:12] Ahbe: @xaryu I havent tuned in for a while, hows this  SoD mage doing? Is it glorious and sorta famous?
[5:34:12] Nimbus723: @willcantstream if by do, you mean host, then yes
[5:34:13] The_palumbo: "its easy" then why hasn't it been done
[5:34:18] bryn_dee: @mr_choc0 I think that is more similar to the "shards" they do in retail
[5:34:24] ameeelio: Not tricky but that means constantly pushing people across layers unexpectedly
[5:34:25] cory_lockman: They are just terrible programmers. Almost anyone with json, c++, javascript knowledge could do it
[5:34:26] SgtDirtbag: mark yourself
[5:34:43] itkbutt3rs: Noooo there goes my ability to farm ore w/o interference. 🙁
[5:34:49] Jabe1127: looks fun
[5:34:50] ctrlbeesy: xarBlock
[5:34:51] StunningPaul: shouldn't have wasted both iceblocks there
[5:34:52] ameeelio: @The_palumbo its because the devs dont want to constantly layer large amounts of people
[5:34:56] RaCks001: you need blast wave
[5:35:00] beergoggless: @xaryu what are your thoughts if they created like a wow version 2.0
[5:35:00] Mico027: @cory_lockman lmao fucking idiot over here
[5:35:03] Seline88: "pvp" :(
[5:35:04] kirk_hunts: I'm already frustrated and I'm not even playing
[5:35:05] espi: this doesn't look like the strat
[5:35:12] The_palumbo: @ameeelio its a more complex issue than people here are simplifying it to be
[5:35:25] hisaki44: how long ppl had to wait for blizz to release phase 2 on wow sod?
[5:35:31] cory_lockman: @Mico027 get a MS SE/CS then talk to me, enjoy ur harassment ban
[5:35:32] PoMsN: yeah fuck STV

[5:36:22] Banana_Nico: pretty bad strat lol
[5:36:24] Nimbus723: yeah this is pretty scuffed lol
[5:36:28] kirk_hunts: nooo STV is amazing. They just need to undo what they just did.
[5:36:31] ameeelio: Doesnt work if you only have 2/5 mages KEKL
[5:36:36] H_9_K: this looks fun :)
[5:36:41] paddylamez: this is horrible bad game
[5:36:42] grizzlyhead: i thought they fixed the lag with the shitty layering? KEKL
[5:36:43] kirk_hunts: They've been doing server maintainence every day I think they're literally just trying things out
[5:36:45] cory_lockman: @The_palumbo jealous? I make $105/hr
[5:36:49] StunningPaul: Every time I've had 5 mages I got loads but also no lag
[5:36:49] mrbooshiama: jesus
[5:36:53] Nimbus723: def need to sync up rezzes
[5:36:53] StunningPaul: so tough one here
[5:37:07] enigmasvea: lag + layering TrollDespair
[5:37:10] Nateypww: can you please get a good ground so the content is actually good?
[5:37:11] The_palumbo: @cory_lockman so do I and didn't need a masters in CS to do it
[5:37:13] Reaperz_kinetic: @cory_lockman if you need to flex what you make an hour online in a group of anonymous people you dont make enough KEKW
[5:37:17] ameeelio: @grizzlyhead They reduced the number of layers bc ppl were complaining the game was dead
[5:37:20] wowreddion: last 6 STV events ive played and every one was the same, full of lag and people layering all over :(
[5:37:22] pastamax: did they nerf Arcade surge?
[5:37:28] cory_lockman: @The_palumbo I got mine for free so???

[5:45:01] ralphh1541: agree, they need to revert the revert
[5:45:01] nrickerds1211: bro get away from the highest populated area...
[5:45:01] DlLDUCK: if only blizzard could figure out how to not have horrible servers
[5:45:01] naxriaa: Blizzard cant make layering work properly, and if they dont have layer its doomed
[5:45:02] PaperbackWritter: I would say that someone in chat might have a twitch prime to be used Hmm
[5:45:03] kirk_hunts: it's not stupid the STV event when it's working it is literally the best pvp event they've ever made
[5:45:11] StunningPaul: European servers were fine when I did it a couple hours ago
[5:45:11] coolcoolcool777dood: how do i use my twitch prime?
[5:45:12] nrickerds1211: its obviously not working
[5:45:17] sengip: what happened to the event?
[5:45:17] coranalols: What was the change?
[5:45:18] kirk_hunts: I am straight up addicted and I already have everything
[5:45:21] simoensays: What were the changes?
[5:45:26] kiffa49: can you not just make stv a multi layer place? so it’s not as bad
[5:45:32] Naydark1326: Is it possible for blizzard to treat STV like an instance with loading screen?
[5:45:35] Seoken1: Its so hard to load balance populations. What they really unfortunately need is a purely instanced STV, so they can spin up/down more servers to specific zone
[5:45:43] wowreddion: it sucks that its so buggy cuz the event was actually so fun
[5:45:45] wowreddion: smh
[5:45:48] stunboyy: the event was not fun sometimes because my teammates wouid be on another layer
[5:45:51] arcane_p: Xaryu you think they going to add Arena at lvl60?
[5:45:58] Seoken1: its a  mismatch of EVERYONE being in STV and NO ONE being  out in the world
[5:46:04] smazex: LESS LAYERS 0 MORE LAG .o
[5:46:04] ostreidiis: if they cant fix the layering they need to cap the amount of people in event the people who join early get to play because u aint getting coins anyways
[5:46:06] Loodimus: Who cares about seeing people in the world let the main event work
[5:46:13] smazex: who could imagine ...
[5:46:14] Saberix69: Ah the good ol' pvp lag
[5:46:14] willcantstream: Or you can buy good servers like an indie company
[5:46:14] chlbli: atm while ppl are still lvling
[5:46:16] ctrlbeesy: cant u see how many ppl are on each layer
[5:46:17] batchestspam: just add layers to only STV.....
[5:46:17] chlbli: this is better
[5:46:18] Yamamoto78: @Seoken1 i can guarantee that is not correct
[5:46:18] creaturesfan72: cant they just make stv have more layers?
[5:46:23] juice42069: mkae the world dead the game is basically single player
[5:46:24] imheremortall: its all cuz they are not fixing core issue with servers but insted trying cheap solutions that never works
[5:46:24] RealDecon: just need more layers for event...?
[5:46:25] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu How about more layers every 3rd hour
[5:46:31] naxriaa: @Xaryu They should make all the people not taking part of STV event be in a different phase
[5:46:33] RaCks001: its not tough, layers are to full
[5:46:34] kirk_hunts: it's pretty simple, fix STV or riot.
[5:46:34] bigolebiggs: a lived in world is great, but crazy lag and 15 minute quests taking an hour due to fighting for mobs might not be worth it
[5:46:36] chlbli: they could just make stv a BG!
[5:46:45] Dj_Oo__: works on EU..
[5:46:45] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu How about more layers every 3rd hour, dynamic
[5:46:46] Gunnan22: Why do we have to pick between two bad options
[5:46:47] lucid2cents: what if just STV had more layers
[5:46:57] prismo5: stv specific extra layers only way to go
[5:46:58] Seoken1: @naxriaa 100% this, opt out players should be on their own layer together
[5:46:59] prismo5: ye
[5:47:00] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: ive never felt once that the world felt dead to me and ive been playing non stop since the beginning of SOD
[5:47:00] blazzedzz: It's a Maga server issue
[5:47:01] Googen: so that's basically sharding from retails
[5:47:02] Roterpirat00: cant they switch it up. when stv is down make less layers. when stv layer up
[5:47:06] espi: that's not possible on Classic servers
[5:47:07] smazex: ITS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAT COMPANY ... HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN?
[5:47:10] inhaledthc: Dunno a week ago when it was "dead" i still found many players
[5:47:10] RocketOgre: @Xaryu I'm on a good layer, not lagging and having a live world back is real nice.
[5:47:16] RocketOgre: Empty Ironforge felt terrible
[5:47:17] el3ctrif13d: So strange that in 2024 we cannot have 100-200 people to pvp at once
[5:47:19] StunningPaul: why wasn't this a problem for Ashenvale events?
[5:47:19] Roodan25: also since they "fixed" this on tuesdays patch, i havent been able to even get on the same layer as any of my group members for STV
[5:47:20] flyingiguana123: im not laggy on living flame server
[5:47:20] Zielepoot: make it like wintergrasp was in wotlk
[5:47:25] al9ksenpai: like they did with ashenvale, they will fix it 1 days before p3
[5:47:30] TheSlawterhouse: the technology is already there for dynamic layering.t hey did it with tbc/wrath classic
[5:47:31] Ardal_Obe: I've just been killing mobs
[5:47:32] el3ctrif13d: Pretty sure nostalriua could do it
[5:47:32] Naydark1326: Is it possible for blizzard to treat STV like an instance with loading screen?
[5:47:32] smazex: ITS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAr COMPANY ... HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN?
[5:47:32] RaCks001: !addons
[5:47:33] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[5:47:33] kirk_hunts: THIS
[5:47:33] kynnad23: this 1000%
[5:47:34] jaltino: THIS IS WORSE
[5:47:35] OGTigolebitties: yeah I’m not this laggy on my server I’m on living flame too
[5:47:35] Ardal_Obe: have 100 blood so far
[5:47:36] bockylockie: this
[5:47:37] ctrlbeesy: this
[5:47:37] jaltino: SHIT
[5:47:37] Kelzic1: empty if
[5:47:38] Thespicycurry: This is a problem on the most populated zones
[5:47:38] Kersed805: empty world is way worse
[5:47:39] washedhasbeen: this
[5:47:40] DatboyRush: Empty if
[5:47:42] kiffa49: idk man, my job makes me do things that is supposed to take a month in 1week
[5:47:42] prismo5: FOR IRONFORGE
[5:47:43] Zuldandi: this
[5:47:43] inspect4: empty if
[5:47:44] splitxxd: emty IF
[5:47:44] Goobadoobadoob: Empty IF
[5:47:44] melvinguyy: empty if
[5:47:45] radassbadass69: empty is worse
[5:47:45] Papa_Shot_: id rather enpty IF
[5:47:46] juice42069: its unplayable
[5:47:47] davepyo: I wonder if their new Rez system causes issues
[5:47:48] arcane_p: NAH empty world is so bad
[5:47:49] ralphh1541: it's a tough call
[5:47:49] DatboyRush: This is only once ever 3 hrs
[5:47:50] Karismus: both
[5:47:52] simstarx: @Xaryu you want a weak aura showing active runes? i made a while back and it's pretty useful.. :)
[5:47:52] espi: nobody cares about empty IF, empty world sucks tho
[5:47:52] teaxdxd: no more free for all just go back to horde vs ally imo
[5:47:54] BeeMcG: who tf cares if IF is empty
[5:47:54] ximu11: maybe they could just hotfix layers inbetween every 3 hours then back
[5:47:55] Kelzic1: whatever is the *current* bad thing is worse
[5:47:59] Kersed805: 30 min event lagging vs entire world feeling dead
[5:48:00] arcane_p: MMO needs to feel alive
[5:48:02] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: IF is empty because theres no reason to be there, SW is never empty
[5:48:02] cabo_chris: can’t they layer just one zone? or does it have to be the whole realm?
[5:48:03] lucid2cents: I’m shocked they wouldn’t predict this issue. laggy WPVP in a paid subscription game is not ok
[5:48:03] hiro25000: We want stv playable. Don't give a fuck of empty Iron Forge
[5:48:04] acaciashrub: i mean IF is absolutely packed on my server/layer rn…
[5:48:07] largist_: this is bad for just STV players, empty world is worse for everyone else
[5:48:07] SireTV: @xaryu how did you decide on a main back in classic? I'm having a hard time being an altoholic (rogue, mage, spriest to name a few already).
[5:48:08] Saberix69: I tuned in and immediately assured lag seeing this lol
[5:48:11] espi: @SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME ?????????
[5:48:12] kirk_hunts: IF has been empty for the last 15 years at least the STV event was fun
[5:48:15] tanllas_: choosing to empty the world to support an event that only happens every 3 hours doesn't make sense
[5:48:17] Falzyker: It's also something they're working on, because making some areas be able to have more layers than others is something that would benefit retail too
[5:48:19] Kelzic1: Kelzic1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[5:48:23] juice42069: the solution is just to make it an instance i feel like
[5:48:28] simstarx: @Xaryu you want a weak aura showing active runes? i made a while back and it's pretty useful.. Chatting
[5:48:34] chlbli: they should make STV a BG Untill they fix the layer issue for it
[5:48:36] Dj_Oo__: you know you get alot more coins when you are at the boss right.. @Xaryu
[5:48:37] Goobadoobadoob: Because this phase IF is the main place to go
[5:48:39] jaltino: They already fixed it
[5:48:42] Thespicycurry: Why not make more layers only for the more populated and pvp servers?
[5:48:43] jaltino: they fixed it last week
[5:48:44] Yamamoto78: dont worry soon ppl will stop doing the event and it will fix itself
[5:48:46] jaltino: then they broke it again
[5:48:46] nenkaz: Oh my friend it looks you need a nice Mojito there, your face of frustration playing with that lag
[5:48:48] bockylockie: why even have this event if thats how its gonna be
[5:48:52] Goobadoobadoob: If it's empty your server is dead
[5:48:55] drioplays: what was the change they made that caused this?
[5:49:02] flyingiguana123: might just be your server, living flame seeems fine
[5:49:07] txmppx: dosnt layer's have same general chat etc. if u need something write there get invited and buff ur in same layer  with enchanter..
[5:49:17] kirk_hunts: @Goobadoobadoob if this event doesn't work the P2 will be dead for real not just seem dead.
[5:49:28] OGTigolebitties: ya I’m fine on living flame rn
[5:49:30] espi: @txmppx chats are by layers, except for trade / LFG
[5:49:38] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: you can also just pve in the zone for bloods
[5:49:42] SeniorUrraca: Jeez this is not fun at all playing like this
[5:49:43] inspect4: its ur server, layer and staying next to altar 24/7. my server is nowhere close to this bad
[5:49:52] Goobadoobadoob: I don't think you realize how little of the population actually does stv
[5:50:17] Saint_Vallion: they dont wanna update the servers KEKW
[5:50:25] mrbooshiama: Ogres have layers
[5:50:32] blazzedzz: It's just the mega servers, non meta servers don't have this issue close to as bad
[5:50:36] drioplays: they should just broadcast the loa location and it will feel lively lol
[5:50:41] guld1337: is this issue new to US? its been like this for weeks on my server in eu
[5:50:41] ctrlbeesy: onions have layers
[5:50:43] Ilove_togetwet: how many coins so far?
[5:50:46] JamesIRL: season of lag
[5:50:47] quentinpooperino: @inspect4 same
[5:50:50] Nappycans: Is it an equipment issue? They dont have the money to upgrade to new tech?
[5:50:58] espi: yeah CrusaderStrike is also the problem here lol
[5:50:58] SeniorUrraca: Be patient, this is a small indie company. They dont have enough resources 🥱
[5:51:01] Melkor_Active: @xaryu Cant they just make Layers Zone based?
[5:51:02] steez0tv: Since when u did your last arena Xaryu
[5:51:04] danielbanks: What pvp ring do you use with this spec @xaryu
[5:51:05] Reaperz_kinetic: BRO
[5:51:06] Saint_Vallion: @SeniorUrraca Clueless
[5:51:07] Reaperz_kinetic: WOW
[5:51:11] FrugalRS: just opted out of the event!
[5:51:13] adam_brisbane: the problem is grouping brings most people onto the same layer so some layers get overcrowded and causes lag, if it was solo would it still lag?
[5:51:17] Reaperz_kinetic: thats not worth
[5:51:20] Udenwo: I got more than that killing mobs lol
[5:51:21] hersheyjh: HUH
[5:51:23] drioplays: sharting?
[5:51:24] wafflers1: sharting
[5:51:25] Uberbane: HUH
[5:51:26] Reaperz_kinetic: YES THEY CAN AND THEY SHOULD
[5:51:26] Gosu_Rival: Kappa Sharting?
[5:51:26] Zynotlive: hmmm
[5:51:28] juice42069: sharting DansGame
[5:51:28] notatallnope: sharting?
[5:51:29] pnuka: i sharted this morning
[5:51:29] Saint_Vallion: HUH
[5:51:30] clattsz: I hate when I shart
[5:51:30] bansheewarr92: why they dont STV an instance bg?
[5:51:30] blazzedzz: If your not a streamer I'd re roll off crusader strike asap lol
[5:51:31] smazex: THE ISSUE IS; ITS LAGGY. the layer arent the issue. just invest 1% of the money we are paying into the game ands its fixed
[5:51:31] callerino12345: huuh
[5:51:32] Anammox: sharting is never a solution
[5:51:33] naturalduck: People wanted mega servers and here we are
[5:51:33] kirk_hunts: that's a lot of laundry
[5:51:35] Torcher4K: sharting can be messy
[5:51:37] focusd: fart til you shart
[5:51:37] notatallnope: xarDownbad
[5:51:40] ipntheshower: i almost sharted after my moring coffee today
[5:51:40] vluggejaapie89: sharded my pants
[5:51:43] adam_brisbane: making it a solo event would help
[5:51:45] Udenwo: sharting is the worst
[5:51:47] willywep: i shart all the time, only makes problems doesn't solve them.
[5:51:49] CrucifyMTG: is the stranglethorn pvp event on pve servers as well?
[5:51:49] ameeelio: no sharding in classic, that kills the game
[5:51:51] Gosu_Rival: beer sharts, the worse
[5:51:51] juice42069: sharting is never the solution
[5:51:53] notatallnope: SHARTING IS NEVER THE SOLUTION XAR
[5:51:57] Abbu1001: melee hunter nerf inc
[5:51:58] Uberbane: stop saying that word
[5:52:00] fingyblaster: queues will kill the game
[5:52:04] danielbanks: Which stv ring does he use with this spec ?
[5:52:05] BeeMcG: better than this explosive diarrhea
[5:52:08] kirk_hunts: @Abbu1001 actually?
[5:52:08] smazex: a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY cant fix this ?!?!?!?!
[5:52:09] Yamamoto78: @crucifymtg yes, and it’s not laggy
[5:52:13] blazzedzz: Crusader shart LUL
[5:52:15] smazex: can believe
[5:52:16] z0e98: really easy to solve, they should create instances of the event and forget the world pvp idea
[5:52:17] itouchbuttons: its going to be a fun weekend for everyone
[5:52:17] steez0tv: Yo xar you gonna back to be competitive in War Within?
[5:52:19] Abbu1001: yes
[5:52:20] largist_: im afraid that classic wow core code is too heavily build on top of layering tech, might be weeks/months/impossible to just change
[5:52:21] mrbooshiama: 2024 and still cant get servers under control
[5:52:22] CrucifyMTG: @Yamamoto78 thx
[5:52:31] Abbu1001: Dual Wield Specialization no longer grants a 30% damage bonus to Raptor Strike for wielding two weapons of the same type.
[5:52:32] kirk_hunts: @Abbu1001 oh damn RIP 30%
[5:52:33] imheremortall: like nostalrius had this fixed 10years ago so it just them being caped on server spendings so they cant actually do anything
[5:52:39] Seline88: they should do sharding during the stv for stv specifically, and layering otherwise
[5:52:39] ostreidiis: tbh wow has always had lag when there this many people in one zone. This event is more fun but it is same classic lag issue
[5:52:39] detourz28: Yesterday the ssame shit happened to me. I was like nah time to leave
[5:52:50] thenazzgu1: Hi, what do you think it will happen with arena in general? I mean, noone will play cata seriously, SOD is joke ofc for real pvp and retail is just too bad
[5:52:52] Handsome_Hans: ngl, watching gnomes die gives me great pleasure
[5:52:55] danielbanks: Which stv ring does he use with this spec
[5:52:56] kirk_hunts: Melee hunter was fun while it lasted boys!
[5:53:05] ipntheshower: Blizzard needs to send players x amount of silver coins for all the bullshit we dealt w during this
[5:53:08] borokato: the 3pm ones are pretty awful usually
[5:53:10] Abbu1001: RIP melee hunter
[5:53:11] willcantstream: duels for gold?
[5:53:12] detourz28: Exactly. I had fun when it worked but lately its been an L
[5:53:13] AsapBarky: well if everyone leaves itll be less laggy right? lol
[5:53:15] NextLevelTabletop: Just to be clear. This seems to only be a problem on Crusader Strike
[5:53:16] prismo5: if no one plays the event no more lag
[5:53:19] tdizziie: Have they changed something just for US servers? On EU we still have smaller layers it seems but no lag
[5:53:19] kirk_hunts: https://www.wowhead.com/blue-tracker/topic/us/season-of-discovery-class-tuning-incoming-february-27-1794513
[5:53:20] xNiccypoo: do you ever just wish that there was good arena to play?
[5:53:21] nenkaz: Chocolate smoothie????????
[5:53:21] Rappster13: AB!
[5:53:21] sum1thatplaysgames: well then blizzard fixed the problem. no one plays the event so the lag will stop
[5:53:23] Kersed805: meanwhile im in a layer thats nearly empty in stv no lag but its boring
[5:53:23] tigerslap_ow: yes
[5:53:24] Kosmicpanther: that kinda solves the problem lol
[5:53:25] sudd7: yea, at first i didnt like it, then they fixed, and i loved it. and now they swapped it back. smh
[5:53:25] Saint_Vallion: Arathi basin its laggy aswell
[5:53:28] myahkaho: yeah
[5:53:37] H_9_K: That's a good business model Kappa
[5:53:39] NawtyTyme: ya get off my sod u plebs
[5:53:40] BeeMcG: it wont
[5:53:42] coolcoolcool777dood: how do i use my twitch prime???
[5:53:42] blazzedzz: Re roll to a non meta server LUL

[5:53:48] SeniorUrraca: !addons
[5:53:48] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[5:53:49] al9ksenpai: but then they see its better, comes back and it lag again :D
[5:53:53] BeeMcG: there will just be less layers
[5:53:55] kirk_hunts: no mage nerfs dang
[5:54:12] foxwinkle: looking for a mage still?
[5:54:13] BeeMcG: it wont help because layers will still be full, there will just be less layers
[5:54:13] Lukeker: Xar whats your addon/wa that lets you confirm talents
[5:54:22] xNiccypoo: What needs to be done for arena to be good again in retail?I used to love arena but now no one seems to play
[5:54:39] 1SparrowTV: wassup xar
[5:54:55] Xzanelol: hunters raptor strike nerfed finally

[6:00:46] thenazzgu1: Hi, what do you think it will happen with arena in general? I mean, noone will play cata seriously, SOD is joke ofc for real pvp and retail is just too bad
[6:00:47] espi: @kirk_hunts straight up false
[6:00:49] noble_daf: noble_daf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! hey stream
[6:00:51] tblizzzy: yo yo
[6:00:55] batchestspam: feral was weakest druid and no buffs Sadge
[6:00:55] pnuka: arathi is fun if you just constantly push for a 4th node
[6:01:09] quentinpooperino: @kirk_hunts still has to shift for wild growth
[6:01:10] Aktiive: any warlock changes?
[6:01:13] lukemeleney: why the fire ring for the pvp build?
[6:01:15] tuna_sandw1ch: make an announcment to AB- "The King is here"
[6:01:22] nickstirratt: Can you show me the helm please?

[6:01:30] sudd7: it's not terrible with spell power rune. but you lose all your extra survivability ofc
[6:01:31] Kirokushin: We in w. U bro!
[6:01:33] nosebleedlol: those boomy buffs just made my balls sooo wet
[6:01:37] ReconMazihoFanda: affli warlocks r super weak
[6:01:42] j3ffchat: imo they have balance the lock the bests out of all so far
[6:02:01] kirk_hunts: @quentinpooperino oh they do it's just healing touch?
[6:02:02] AdamAnt7: oh so every stv event
[6:02:09] bitoukax: nothing for warriors ?? T-T
[6:02:14] ctrlbeesy: skill issue
[6:02:16] quentinpooperino: @kirk_hunts ye
[6:02:17] sum1thatplaysgames: I really wish Affliction was good.
[6:02:18] Zielepoot: ranged hunters got overlooked
[6:02:19] yellowgaiden: i can do 200 dps with dots
[6:02:23] espi: alffiction locks are only good when damage is low
[6:02:24] adam_brisbane: Ranged hunter is the worse class beside frost mage but no buffs for them
[6:02:27] Synax004: where are these patch notes?
[6:02:30] wowreddion: is this premade AB? or pug
[6:02:31] willcantstream: FoF + Icelance??
[6:02:31] HansHeadshot: Does eu servers and US servers have completely different stats/settings for classes?
[6:02:33] plae007: @Xaryu Boomy buffs just made them more Restokin, Moonfire DMG isnt even worth casting in a PVE setting so the  "buff" to it does nothing
[6:02:33] Udenwo: @ReconMazihoFanda we will have our time next phase with DOTs critting
[6:02:34] davepyo: it’s Asmon’s guild
[6:02:38] radassbadass69: warriors are actually okay for the most part - I say this having just grinded to exalted for WSG
[6:02:42] kirk_hunts: @quentinpooperino ohhhhhh I see now I lumped wild growth in there ok it's not that insane
[6:02:54] kirk_hunts: it's still pretty crazy
[6:02:57] StunningPaul: That was the worst lag I've ever seen you have ...so they made it worse than before
[6:03:11] gwockomole: It would be nice to see some love to frost mages... especially increase proc chance of fingers of frost. Maybe 25 or 30% rather than 15
[6:03:16] OGTigolebitties: lock is still good it’s just rough in stv
[6:03:17] nosebleedlol: @plae007 i can spam remove curse and poisons now in boomie, that alone is huge screw thew moonfire dm,gh
[6:03:18] Kosmicpanther: surprised no frost mage pve buff
[6:03:28] ThaBigChonk: yo wuddup xar
[6:03:30] willcantstream: yes
[6:03:50] radassbadass69: its okay for a spec to kind of just be "the pvp spec"
[6:03:52] kirk_hunts: Have you seen the speed run guilds are all running 3 warrior dps and clearing gnomer in 20 minutes.
[6:03:53] batchestspam: frost has and always will be the worst spec in game for pve
[6:03:57] Deatharmor98: @radassbadass69 Much agree
[6:04:04] sudd7: yea, but increase lance dmg by 50% imo
[6:04:06] pio_climber: if I may ask, when did you start playing WoW, I am new on your twitch
[6:04:08] Guidry: has built in utility, should be low on parses
[6:04:12] FIREMAGZZ: how much did the robot eye cost you?
[6:04:15] projecthd: why dont they just tune pvp separate in sod
[6:04:17] Zielepoot: Xar they reduced armor value in gnomer too
[6:04:23] radassbadass69: classic
[6:04:25] ironmouse34: if they go that route then we need dual spec
[6:04:28] bastler10: You didn't cap
[6:04:30] adam_brisbane: so what is ranged hunter it is not great for pvp or pve?
[6:04:37] radassbadass69: if gnomer boss armor is down, warriors dont need help
[6:04:42] ThaBigChonk: whole horde team sitting BS lmao
[6:04:48] sativa090: isnt frost normally what they play in MC tho?
[6:04:50] kirk_hunts: it's ok in pvp and not viable in pve atm
[6:05:01] Saint_Vallion: leaks
[6:05:01] Ervill1: updated post
[6:05:05] chefshefko: Ooo nice
[6:05:08] Zielepoot: eu forum post
[6:05:20] xXxBarlogxXx: Gotta remember realm pop matters for STV lag, never have lag on the pve realms lol
[6:05:25] kirk_hunts: @adam_brisbane it's ok in pvp and not viable in pve come tuesday
[6:05:28] lordhodza: did that full STV XAR, 179 coins.... that WAS NOT a good experiance! :( plx fix it BLIZZZZAAAARRRDD
[6:05:30] espi: The increased armor value of certain mechanical bosses in Gnomeregan has been reduced slightly. Developers’ notes: The higher armor values on certain mechanical enemies in Gnomeregan was correct and intended, but we will adjust the armor on Crowd Pummeler 9-60 and Mekingeer Thermaplugg slightly to provide up to a 10% increase in physical damage received, depending on modifiers present. We also checked the Mechanical Managerie, and it is using the correct armor values.
[6:05:34] TundraSpice: aaszz as w uni5000 uni1000 uni5000
[6:05:34] tuna_sandw1ch: in 2005(15 y.o) I remember capturing a flag and calling off work as a dishwasher hahaha

[6:06:13] Crawll: is this RBGS?
[6:06:20] sudd7: ranged hunter is good at sniping one shots in pvp if you go lone wolf. 1400 aimed shot crits, combined with a regular shot for 500+ and a multi shot for 500+
[6:06:22] lukemeleney: @Crawll no
[6:06:23] ThaBigChonk: that lock is salty you got that kill
[6:06:25] Udenwo: Don't forget BGs have increased HP
[6:06:26] Udenwo: by a lot
[6:06:29] adam_brisbane: @kirk_hunts that is what I melee which is fine but not to buff ranged like they buffed sp and druids other abilities when they nerf
[6:06:32] LueDawg: new class tuning post
[6:06:38] trackfourlife: lack of healers
[6:06:40] ironmouse34: @tuna_sandw1ch lol I used to call out sick a lot back then .... AV games were literally hours long

[6:07:34] Noviike: What did they change in the stv event?
[6:07:35] willcantstream: that FoF + Icelance experiment did not last long kekW
[6:07:37] Ardal_Obe: to put it into perspective, 100 coins in 30 minutes is equal to 1 ab which also takes about 30 minutes
[6:07:38] Ilove_togetwet: at least we dont pay montly fees
[6:07:39] crackerssx: how any coins did u get xar

[6:07:47] kirk_hunts: @adam_brisbane yeah it's really unfortunate that our ranged dps is garbage even with the epic gun and they nerf the only pure dps class left in the game's only viable raid spec.

[6:08:26] Nappycans: yep, 1 win in like 3 hours
[6:08:30] Nightfocus: Well the good pvpers play Horde mainly , so ye Alliance loses
[6:08:33] pew2700: That event was absolute trash
[6:08:36] heyitsken_: @xaryu does playing organized classic pvp ever make you crave retail pvp? just curious
[6:08:40] radassbadass69: pro pvpers losing in BGs should speak volumes to the people who melt down in /instance chat about their own team
[6:08:41] pew2700: Blizzard removed 2 layers for whatever reason
[6:08:42] FIREMAGZZ: alliance may be better than the horde, but but horde are so much better at group pvp then alliance
[6:08:44] bondaru07: @Xaryu reactor goat
[6:08:47] nosebleedlol: you need the AU alliance to win
[6:08:59] homerjay1022: watching this makes me kinda wanna try it in retail but not that much

[6:11:39] kirk_hunts: I get deleted by a mage in the middle of a zone and have a 3 minute ghost run to my body and that of course isn't even mentioned and nerfing the mage 1 shot wouldn't even be a pve nerf

[6:18:59] ellyger: so does someone know where it mentioned armor nerfs in Gnomer?
[6:19:37] realandtruephobe: have you gotten the helm proc yet?
[6:19:40] espi: @ellyger The increased armor value of certain mechanical bosses in Gnomeregan has been reduced slightly. Developers’ notes: The higher armor values on certain mechanical enemies in Gnomeregan was correct and intended, but we will adjust the armor on Crowd Pummeler 9-60 and Mekingeer Thermaplugg slightly to provide up to a 10% increase in physical damage received, depending on modifiers present. We also checked the Mechanical Managerie, and it is using the correct armor values.
[6:19:55] xNiccypoo: why don't mages use polymorph that much in pvp?

[6:28:40] nosebleedlol: winning as alliance is brutal, i dont understand. we have bots or something
[6:28:41] jakaupr: wowhead @Xaryu
[6:28:42] gen1e: @Venfehz play sod, xp boost up to level 25, loads of people still levelling, and you can play retail while you wait for next phase when you're done with it
[6:28:51] mattymc282: think you'll be back playing retail?
[6:28:52] reeeemennnf: what are you going fot
[6:28:57] jakaupr: oh my bad
[6:29:06] nosebleedlol: i wasnt either, until this phase
[6:29:13] Voluntaristgirl: Ireluv <3
[6:29:17] pugrootbeer: What does battle grounds do for you?
[6:29:18] davepyo: definitely a fun watch
[6:29:22] Voluntaristgirl: We rocked you
[6:29:26] inspect4: i think all pve noobs play as alliance and thats why we lose every bg
[6:29:32] radassbadass69: I don't understand the X faction wins all the time talk. I have overall mixed experiences within both factions
[6:29:36] detourz28: I have had an issue in AB this phase on my ally toon. On horde always winning. Not sure what is up
[6:29:37] tawkey: Ms Rachel ftw!
[6:29:43] recursive84: XARYU DO U KNOW DAVE NEWMAN?

[6:29:58] itstnew: bg grind takes the longest to get rep
[6:29:59] sawan2k: All epic BGs are dominated by ally
[6:30:02] prfssrzaddy: YEP
[6:30:04] Deatharmor98: HORDE get to boss quicker
[6:30:05] sankos1990: And lot of fun! 😌
[6:30:06] lukemeleney: it's cause they go downhill
[6:30:08] movit1: na Horde winns more
[6:30:09] Deatharmor98: Theyre starting tunnel is closer
[6:30:21] Deatharmor98: Their* rofl
[6:30:30] rhynory: bad ad timing
[6:30:30] radassbadass69: yeeeah not only do they spawn closer but they have a better chokepoint base
[6:30:38] Beastonian: @Deatharmor98 Alliance always get to boss before horde in AV.
[6:30:40] Ardal_Obe: AB is slightly favored for horde because LM mobility is easier than mine mobility
[6:30:45] BoomTJ_: Alliance have the bridge that can defend better than horde can
[6:30:49] lukemeleney: your like all melee build would be even better this week
[6:30:50] gen1e: are those changes live?
[6:30:50] BoomTJ_: In AV
[6:30:51] Ardal_Obe: and horde get LM bridge
[6:30:58] mriicks: Link pls
[6:31:04] limburgse: when this bluenotes go live?
[6:31:19] zollicious14: no. AB is slightly ally favored. stables closer to spawn than farm. otherwise its equal
[6:31:25] limburgse: okay
[6:31:28] Ardal_Obe: doesn't matter
[6:31:36] Ardal_Obe: stables and farm tick at the same time now
[6:31:37] inspect4: @zollicious14 hordes have faster route from lm to bs
[6:31:42] Thespicycurry: Alliance have a definite advantage in AV. You have to cross the bridge of death and Horde has some towers that Alliance walk through towers and don't get pelted by ranged classes and npcs
[6:31:46] prfssrzaddy: Horde are just naturally bad at objectives. We would rather fight mid and lose
[6:32:10] vhalron: there it is
[6:32:26] nosebleedlol: allinace is pve dads, thats why we losing is AB LUL
[6:32:27] ipntheshower: Big xarCoC
[6:32:42] j_dizzledawg: ok YEAH
[6:32:56] wachupita: EZ
[6:32:59] scoutbeans: stables, GM and BS seem the easiest to hold as ally
[6:33:23] Beastonian: WoW is geared towards alliance. That's why Humans have sword specialization and all the best weapons are swords
[6:33:31] Whalechill: for the gnome empire
[6:33:39] blazzedzz: BGs wins come down to who has more heals
[6:33:56] Badbotqt: nice auto cs on warr for the lock
[6:33:56] smazex: <3
[6:34:00] Phrosted_: for gnomeregan!!
[6:34:14] nilleman1: HODOR
[6:34:21] smashdakeys: too soon.
[6:34:27] inspect4: @nosebleedlol yeh i agree alliance must have alot more pve dads who just keyboard turn in ab
[6:34:43] Kanhelx: do other ally players also mostly lose all sod bg's? or do I just git gud
[6:34:45] troobii: What are your thoughts on Ice lance? Just not strong enough over Living bomb?
[6:35:00] Weddzz: Idk but ally always seem to go for GM :p
[6:35:59] Argonisha: id rather take AB over ice lance even
[6:36:05] Argonisha: tbh
[6:36:21] tuna_sandw1ch: you could do premades to sell gdkp items
[6:36:23] gwockomole: It feels bad having to play every mage spec with living bomb
[6:36:25] xyz_Tick: where's honney?
[6:36:32] Plaguethong: Do you like living flame more than icy veins, and why?
[6:36:37] Argonisha: thats why I play healer @gwockomole
[6:36:52] Argonisha: best spec :P
[6:37:29] Plaguethong: i see
[6:37:38] nosebleedlol: @inspect4 i think we're better off making full premades with the rate of the skill gap on randoms in AB alliance v horde
[6:37:45] Truthseeker96: whos gonna eat a full living flame tho LUL
[6:37:46] zoookii: thats why priest is broken because he has dispel

[6:41:05] prfssrzaddy: Guilt tripping

[6:52:47] gen1e: hardcore hype kinda dead
[6:52:51] crackerssx: what day does sf start
[6:52:55] espi: not hype because they're not new server and ppl will just get carried by non-SF ppl
[6:53:02] Catalystic_Sudo: pvp then haha
[6:53:07] frenzynik: !build
[6:53:08] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu

[6:53:15] naponator: lowkey lost what to do at 40 besides gnomer, any advice?
[6:53:16] HurricaneWho: oh is it the same HC servers? :(
[6:53:17] thendj: i dont get solo self found when the addon was the exact same thing no?
[6:53:22] tuna_sandw1ch: pvp is best part of wow
[6:53:25] Nezhoni: modCheck
[6:53:27] goatedsp: SSF is just objectively less fun, 0 community is resident sleeper
[6:53:28] davepyo: HC SF is the ultimate challenge. maybe too much of one
[6:53:30] Manco1: fair enough, ty for the honest take
[6:53:34] Ardal_Obe: when's the SoDcore Gnomer challenge?
[6:53:35] panzerrfist: @lordhodza  Stare
[6:53:40] HurricaneWho: and its not SSF its just SF
[6:53:48] nemcoy: Blizzard is terriple with their own releases, it like they want to screw themselves over
[6:53:54] Catalystic_Sudo: what is ssf??
[6:54:01] WheezyFbaby_: it’s not even fresh HC servers it’s dead before it launched ….
[6:54:04] tapstertv: @tuna_sandw1ch i agree but it seems like a minority of players participate which is mind boggling
[6:54:06] fierypunch: using stv to lvl AB rep
[6:54:07] aaTaco: solo self found
[6:54:07] badillwwjoe: they basically put no effort to HC compare to SOD
[6:54:07] gen1e: +rune quests etc
[6:54:11] alandin82: imagine not having exalted wsg rep for the purple bis bracers
[6:54:17] SgtDirtbag: getting ab exalted cool prep for 60 epic
[6:54:36] gweinidlo: @Xaryu Warrior discord going crazy about Hunter nerfs and Shaman buffs lol
[6:54:39] shadwarform: Hi xar! I didnt hit 40 yet, in slacking
[6:54:44] willcantstream: ironforge is dead
[6:54:44] inspect4: took me about 15 hrs of wsg for exalted it was pretty easy
[6:54:50] sgtsquirtle1993: hey xar you are looking fresh to death
[6:54:50] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu WSG rep is really easy to farm up to revered
[6:54:54] tuna_sandw1ch: ppl forget that blizzard is a $75 bill company, they cant cater to everything..
[6:54:55] StevenAyee: StevenAyee subscribed with Prime. 
[6:54:56] Pilky02: overall an amazing job with sod i think
[6:54:58] sickymalo: SSF
[6:55:04] Thespicycurry: Does STV even give an AB rep or only AB?
[6:55:06] peahness: will you play hc ssf in 6 days ?
[6:55:09] unselfish123: are you going hard on cats classic?
[6:55:12] inspirox: how much of that is new content though.
[6:55:14] Orsoooh: Did you try fire build with hot streak yet?
[6:55:14] Catalystic_Sudo: help me what is ssf I’m lost haha
[6:55:17] inspect4: @Thespicycurry yes
[6:55:18] realandtruephobe: @Thespicycurry you can buy AB rep with STV event coins
[6:55:19] tuna_sandw1ch: its like when MS doesnt update ActionForms in excel, I get it
[6:55:21] kindaopmusic: new cod came out when SOD did too i think
[6:55:29] CrazenFPS: meow
[6:55:29] dulgr_1: Blizz is just late on things...  They should have innovated HC on their own.  By the time they created servers the big hype was gone
[6:55:31] smashdakeys: tell that to your forehead.
[6:55:34] naturalduck: invite to xaryu layer Kappa
[6:55:39] stimmedmarin: Make BG's with no death penalty in Hardcore? Would bring more players for the PVP?

[6:58:09] june_ofc: with how busted the classes are at 40 I can’t imagine what things are going to be like at 60
[6:58:09] alexbilbaoo: RBGS at 60 is a must
[6:58:24] Ilove_togetwet: "did my sub go off" is the "hey bud, you got a cig?" when you see them smoking
[6:58:26] DLC90itno: Whered the hair go? Piratemode ovah?
[6:58:32] ameeelio: Yeah BG's in hardcore is a 0 IQ take

[6:59:05] ameeelio: @celestius11 ty :)
[6:59:34] Divinelust: I hope they change the R14 grind.. we dont need a group discord telling people how much honor they can get per week
[6:59:40] Oathstealerx: What server are you on?
[6:59:47] Xzanelol: they already did
[6:59:55] YuraruY: are the class tunnings already working or not?
[6:59:55] espi: the UI should just TELL YOU
[6:59:56] Cowmance: imagine blizz bans xar for this gold transaction lmao
[6:59:59] Shredmuffn: so many SoD player hate cata but literally everything the ask for is from cata LUL
[7:00:01] nickjames0: <3
[7:00:05] TommyR44: what bag on do u have?
[7:00:07] Mandoogles: @Divinelust they changed that
[7:00:09] itsquetzy: @Divinelust they already did bro

[7:00:14] tuna_sandw1ch: 5g duels..
[7:00:19] tuna_sandw1ch: at least
[7:00:19] oblivion_live: how do you feel beating my boy bashtard in a dis call with him now
[7:00:24] Divinelust: Decay isn't the issue, it's the brackets the problem
[7:00:45] Erashawn: @Xaryu what do you think about the +7 frost spell damage to staff enchant, do you think that is better than the +3 intellect?
[7:00:46] Mandoogles: yea now its just honor to get to next rank its not brackets anymore
[7:00:46] espi: shouldn't need an addon to tell you that was their point I think
[7:00:48] lordhodza: u need bit less for rank 5
[7:00:49] animapoly: I'm back to retail to refresh my classic addiction/hype. Tbh I enjoy retail right now

[7:00:57] KosmicDevil_: isnt rank 3 like 4500 honor
[7:01:01] oblivion_live: @xaryu do you think the duel vs bashtard was close?
[7:01:01] panzmat: what's the 80, 60, and 40% in the addon
[7:01:06] trmonx: its a cap set by blizzard not bracket
[7:01:07] TommyR44: what bag on u use?
[7:01:23] lordhodza: yup
[7:01:26] Divinelust: Thing is, higher ranks have brackets so only a percentage of people can get R14 for example right? or did they change that too?
[7:01:29] Xzanelol: ranker
[7:01:34] Argonisha: i got 125k honor last week and im only 13k/21k for exalted WSG ResidentSleeper
[7:01:37] ScryerTV: i'd be careful to go with less honor then it says
[7:01:41] MewhTV: @Divinelust afaik they removed decay
[7:01:44] Ilove_togetwet: ANDROID SUCKS
[7:01:46] kokoMcgogo: @Divinelust THey changed that - you just need raw honor to advance
[7:01:48] Asrael42: @xaryu just do Stv event and exchange for honor. you get 9k+ honor for every event easy with a good grp
[7:01:50] jonte_nix: what was this pvp addeon called
[7:01:50] trmonx: @Divinelust they changed blizz added hard cap flat

[7:02:08] Divinelust: That's good then!
[7:02:15] YuraruY: are the class tunnings already working or not? 󠀀
[7:02:21] realandtruephobe: @Asrael42 lol he's aware
[7:02:34] Yamamoto78: no reward could get me to farm for pvp rep
[7:02:34] MariusDag: mage armor doesn't reduce pain duration=
[7:02:51] badillwwjoe: is it useless to use homunculi to mage?
[7:02:51] nickjames0: !stream
[7:02:55] Melkor_Active: @xaryu nono the addon is correct. You just rank up with stages. You cant get at rank 5 0%
[7:02:56] chazz143: what do reward do you get for the honour?
[7:03:09] Dsniper11A: go arathi now
[7:03:20] Yamamoto78: @chazz143 one piece of gear
[7:03:21] casca322: heh asmon's guild
[7:03:23] Perkasetz: @Xaryu what are the %s on ranker, why does it say rank 5 with 40%, wouldnt i just need rank 5 without the 40% lol?
[7:03:32] Dizzlay00: Bro just got my plate epic too on the prot Pala. Loving p2.
[7:03:34] NAT0_141: does Xaryu use frost armor or ice armor?

[7:05:04] nickjames0: Big d duel there
[7:05:04] Perkasetz: so do i actually need 45? @Xaryu
[7:05:06] kompany111: any MAGE chads in here that know if there is a weakaura to tell an idiot like me when hotstreak goes off
[7:05:11] MewhTV: @Xaryu probably had something to do with decay
[7:05:19] iPlayGamez: So you will get Rank 5 and be 40% into the rank 5
[7:05:27] pekayy01: Kappa
[7:05:30] iPlayGamez: with 60| to rank 6
[7:05:30] lordhodza: it say u r reaching rank 5 and 40percent towards rank 6....so you need less. ITs bit confusing but yea
[7:05:35] FurylordD: that guy is stacked
[7:05:47] Mapsize_: @Perkasetz there are certain tresholds that ''jumps'' you up in honor, i.e. from one treshold to the next there is no progress, but as soon as you hit it it makes a huge jump.
[7:06:06] stimmedmarin: Xaryu why not BG's with no perma death? Its already possible to do a Normal duel in Harcdcore with no death Pentalty?
[7:06:06] naturalduck: saved block on a 10g duel GIGACHAD
[7:06:16] Duks6: i challenge thee
