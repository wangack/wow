[0:10:57] OfficialShammer: Hey Jdot! Stupid question, On your left side you have the group stuns. I assume its OmniCC, How do you add that to the UI?
[0:12:32] devilhawk83: Ai think it is a weakaura as I got the exact same one @officialshammer
[0:12:58] Whitewolf1441: Whitewolf1441 watched 20 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! yes
[0:13:01] OfficialShammer: @devilhawk83 Happen to know where I can get the WA?
[0:13:50] bug_legacy: @OfficialShammer you can do it with OmniCD by making another "window" and tracking those spells
[0:13:57] devilhawk83: check wago.io and type interrupt tracker
[0:13:58] Kinkrs: @OfficialShammer https://wago.io/QXHvE1FVY/7
[0:14:08] Spritesgud: JB how are high keys with shadow priests feeling? Got mine geared up to 482 and have been blasting through some 24-25s feeling good so far
[0:14:20] OfficialShammer: Love you all! thanks for the help!
[0:16:23] mimich: 68 raiders from mimich have joined!

[0:16:41] bambo_leila: hello
[0:16:54] mimich: stream title nrsGood
[0:19:05] brewteafulgaming: Afternoon all
[0:19:15] DuckkiTV: Fking rip
[0:19:23] Spritesgud: what is it that trucks tanks on this boss?
[0:19:34] DuckkiTV: The boss
[0:19:40] devilhawk83: This fight is so ass on Tyrannical
[0:19:57] cheesey_oce: which keys do you tree of life vs convoke?
[0:20:01] Spritesgud: ah ive never tanked over like a 20-22 on it so never really felt the severity of it
[0:20:06] DuckkiTV: How did convoke feel there?
[0:20:09] DuckkiTV: better than tree?
[0:20:35] branphd: everbloom is just fucked Madge
[0:21:20] totalecl1pse_: do you use convoke as a damage cooldown?
[0:21:42] devilhawk83: Everbloom and TotT are so FailFish
[0:22:03] DuckkiTV: It was actually kinda sick your lock actually Brezed the Tank same time you brezed the dps lol
[0:22:09] DuckkiTV: Or was tank already souled?
[0:22:48] bug_legacy: @DuckkiTV the tank should always be souled, specially paly, dk, and bear, since they can brez too
[0:23:09] branphd: pepeJAMJAM
[0:23:34] vilewow: do you log your keys?
[0:23:35] devilhawk83: I could only imagine all the complaining people will do if SotS and Tol Dagor ever come back to M+ FailFish
[0:23:59] branphd: @devilhawk83 please no monkaS
[0:24:29] bug_legacy: BFA dungeons and evokers pulling ceiling mobs round 2
[0:25:15] razortanktv: please link playlist :D

[0:25:30] StreamElements: Benzi - BENZI
[0:25:42] jdotb: https://soundcloud.com/benzi/momtrapz2
[0:25:48] razortanktv: ty!
[0:25:50] devilhawk83: @branphd I don’t want both back along with a few others like Shado-Pan Monastery, Earth Core and Halls of Origination as I know they would not be fun as M+ dungeons @bug_legacy
[0:26:12] devilhawk83: but I am expecting Blizzard to add them
[0:26:25] branphd: @devilhawk83 yeah, if anything I'd want more legion dungeons back than any others, but that's just me
[0:26:57] devilhawk83: Just not Seat of the Triumvirate @branphd chrysLUL
[0:27:10] branphd: @devilhawk83 monkaS forgot about that one
[0:27:27] toastbam: Yo jb. I feel like I've seen you parked in front of the everbloom for like 5 days straight now
[0:27:39] Daddykyns: Daddykyns subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[0:27:46] bug_legacy: @devilhawk83 it is very likely that they will bring back every M+ dungeon ever created because it requires less work than reworking pre-legion dungeons
[0:28:38] branphd: @bug_legacy I don't mind that honestly, I loved most of the legion dungeons, I didn't play much of shadowlands though so not much of an opinion there
[0:28:49] Guffels: Guffels subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! how do I know when its time to move on from my current guild. we are 200 pulls on smolderon and i get the feeling ce wont be possible
[0:29:20] speels414: just went through that
[0:30:10] Whitewolf1441: they wanted it to last as long as possible lol
[0:30:36] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:30:40] Spritesgud: thought about trying to get into another guild?
[0:30:50] Spritesgud: or are you happy with where you're at
[0:31:09] devilhawk83: @bug_legacy they can’t even get Post-Legion tuning right most of the time so I got no faith that future M+ dungeon will be tuned well either way
[0:31:49] vilewow: i don't remember any fight behind more movement heavy than smolderon
[0:31:51] Guffels: we just have alot of casters still dying to world in flames even though we are going into lust sub-40%. lots of people too greedy to drop some damage in intermission to not die
[0:31:53] Conzo_Live: Hey JB, would you rather have elbows for hands or have a big toe as each foot?
[0:31:55] vilewow: since mythic has been a thing
[0:32:42] Jarlan23: would it be a regular sized big toe or like a giant big toe
[0:32:47] Guarok: What up JB
[0:32:48] Rypick: @jdotb do you have a big wigs profile to import bars and messages
[0:33:00] Conzo_Live: @Jarlan23 Giant big toe
[0:33:02] bug_legacy: @devilhawk83 yea. part of what makes tuning non-current-xpac dungeons hard is different goals and philosophies when the dungeons were made
[0:33:42] alishoop: can you walk on this large toe?
[0:33:49] alishoop: its important
[0:34:02] Gaz_Games_: imagine the size of the nail clippers tho
[0:34:06] alishoop: Listening
[0:34:06] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:34:07] The_Loony_Bin: You got a hoof, ya know the foot
[0:34:17] Conzo_Live: now that I'm thinking about it, it might be even substantially more efficient to have one large big toe.
[0:34:35] Jarlan23: it would make buying socks difficult and you'd need to invest in oversized toenail clippers
[0:34:42] Jarlan23: elbows for hands looking better and better
[0:35:39] squirebdd: jb such a diva
[0:36:07] Demazia: Would you rather have a vagina for lips or a penis for a nose
[0:36:16] devilhawk83: Also, and that is a nitpick, but i also feel that most of the mobs Pre-BfA dungeons were made when with the Blood Elves’ AoE silences in mind as TotT groups and even EB’s were far easier to deal with when you got the AoE silence, but since they convert it to a AoE Magic Dispell, Blood Elves kinda lost their effectiveness @bug_legacy
[0:36:43] devilhawk83: @demazia FailFish
[0:36:53] Demazia: Compelling choice right there @devilhawk83
[0:37:02] devilhawk83: yep
[0:37:14] Guarok: Did you see the fix for the battlefield boss in Rise?
[0:37:15] devilhawk83: not in a good way
[0:38:03] VelhoApache: VelhoApache subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! much love, JB
[0:38:19] blue321: Can confirm gorgers are still bugged btw
[0:38:29] devilhawk83: chrysLUL chrysLUL
[0:38:56] Guarok: No longer gains stacks from frontal
[0:39:48] Shurafna: bladestorm id think
[0:39:51] bug_legacy: @Guarok so, only bladestorm gives stacks?
[0:39:54] Shurafna: or w/e it is
[0:39:57] vickmantwo: By killing adds in any way possible
[0:40:02] vickmantwo: Whether shockwave or bladestorm
[0:40:11] Conzo_Live: I was forced by my guild to swap war for raid (our warrior left :/). Let me tell you, swapping from DH to warrior really showcases how ass warriors are rn.
[0:40:35] Guffels: so you still do the fight the same way, just get screwed less when someone baits bad
[0:40:38] Guffels: mid change tbh
[0:40:48] Guarok: I wonder if it was only intended to give him stacks if a player was hit by it.
[0:41:31] craftypawn: Hey Jdot, I'm having to reroll onto Priest from MW for Fyrakk... on a sacle of 1 - full blown horror, how is playing Disc on it?
[0:41:32] Guffels: so can you do anything cool like intentionally killing ads with the shockwave?
[0:41:46] Guffels: @craftypawn are you not the onl MW in your raid??
[0:41:58] whiskeyhide: Deadge
[0:42:07] Exogenesis9: Surprised that was the one to get changed when Morchie is the more annoying boss with root shenanigans.
[0:42:21] craftypawn: No Disc experience xD
[0:42:26] Guffels: doomed
[0:42:41] craftypawn: Full blown horror isn't it :D
[0:42:44] craftypawn: hahahahaha
[0:42:59] Guffels: but like MW is bis healer on Fyrakk so why is it you changing?
[0:43:13] JakobLowrizzle: disc is quite a learning curve lol
[0:43:14] craftypawn: We have another MW who can come in
[0:43:20] craftypawn: But not a priest
[0:43:29] Thatsafy: @craftypawn just say you had dips on mw and they need to swap
[0:43:30] Guffels: tell them to swap lol
[0:43:34] vilewow: rerolling is fake, we killed it with hpriest + triple mw
[0:43:34] Lara_TV_: It's not like Disc is necessary for the fight either
[0:43:35] craftypawn: Tindral killed out only priest
[0:43:40] craftypawn: our*
[0:43:55] Lara_TV_: Ah... oof
[0:44:00] craftypawn: It is the only priest in the raid yeah
[0:44:08] Guffels: you would have better luck learning holy if its just for the buff
[0:44:08] craftypawn: I'm happy to play Holy
[0:44:15] craftypawn: Like that's fine
[0:44:26] Lara_TV_: Yeah just play holy then imo
[0:44:53] craftypawn: Holy/MW/Holypal/Rdru
[0:45:22] Lara_TV_: that was our comp with Pres instead of Rdru
[0:45:23] Guffels: salv and hymn are so busted
[0:45:52] diroter: how's fyrakk?
[0:45:55] Guffels: the biggest loss without disc is small ad healing but yeah resto druid fills that whole
[0:45:59] craftypawn: Nice Lara - can you DM me a log to have a look at?
[0:46:39] craftypawn: OK this is sounding positive - Holy is the way :)
[0:47:47] thenewchamp: what weakaura is that for your mouse over ?
[0:48:03] treavorthenusance: @craftypawn disc is just such timing based spec that if your not playing it a bunch your gonna get like 30% of the actual value out of it.
[0:48:14] Guffels: @thenewchamp Ultimate Mouse Cursor
[0:48:57] thenewchamp: Ty
[0:49:13] craftypawn: @treavorthenusance Yeah it's a huge true. I can play it n keys just fine, but then I have lots of key experience and raiding as Disc is just very diffrent.
[0:49:36] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:49:37] Guffels: raiding as disc is more about good mrt timers than player skill. its extremely cringe
[0:49:57] Guffels: if it wasnt for topping the meters i wouldnt be caught dead playing it lol
[0:49:58] Lara_TV_: catJAM
[0:50:12] maenkins: catJAM

[1:01:22] Whitewolf1441: this boss is an abomination
[1:02:03] madtrade2600: still better than archmage
[1:02:32] Whitewolf1441: archmage is kinda fun
[1:02:49] treavorthenusance: 3/4 bosses in eb are just unfun as heck to play not to mention cinderstorm is just rng russian roulette
[1:03:15] EmElw: make that 4/4
[1:03:20] EmElw: idc which one you think is fun but youre wrong
[1:03:22] Guffels: so are we gunna run this on loop to get us through Fyrakk lol
[1:03:23] madtrade2600: yeah the tree is a complete bore
[1:03:32] madtrade2600: cinderstorm is absurd
[1:03:35] Exogenesis9: I just want like 10-15 extra seconds between adds on last boss.
[1:03:38] ErikJugend: Where do you find these mixes?
[1:03:43] treavorthenusance: @EmElw the tree just lets me dps as a healer so its sorta fun lol
[1:03:50] JackOfAllApocalypses: tree is not unfun
[1:04:16] Guffels: yeah im never gunna complain about tree. never complain about 0 healing bosses
[1:04:19] treavorthenusance: the last three bosses are just mega butt clinch and even the mage trash is butt clinch
[1:05:27] Exogenesis9: When did the ret trait swap, after first?
[1:05:36] Guffels: @Exogenesis9 yes ret and mage
[1:05:46] Eatmeillidan: This dungeon is so easy it makes Yard look hard
[1:06:00] maenkins: lebronJAM

[1:06:13] therealborko: there's no music on the youtube stream, just jb humming
[1:06:17] Guffels: this man has never pulled 3rd boss above 23 apparently
[1:06:29] Guffels: @therealborko KEKW
[1:06:39] EmElw: peak difficulty of this is on like 22
[1:06:45] EmElw: cause it can actually kill you but no one presses anything
[1:07:06] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:07:13] therealborko: did a 23 of it the other day, worst rng I'd experienced yet, every time it was fire with something else
[1:07:25] EmElw: ye it bugs sometimes
[1:07:33] EmElw: its not supposed to do that
[1:07:43] Guffels: gg

[1:08:49] kelly_mac06: Did you know this song (Cher's Believe) is the first song to use autotune?
[1:09:10] Guffels: based mage alter
[1:09:23] treavorthenusance: @kelly_mac06 way back then they had to use a stick to use it cause it was manual tune
[1:09:42] Exogenesis9: 4 hits each. Fun times
[1:09:58] Lara_TV_: mage will have cold
[1:10:00] kelly_mac06: @kelly_mac06 LOL
[1:10:04] Guffels: mass barrier plus ice cold pluus good rng?
[1:10:16] madtrade2600: so tight
[1:10:17] kelly_mac06: it's funny, everyone hates on TPain for autotune but it was really Cher
[1:10:21] maenkins: the icecold from the mage GIGACHAD
[1:10:23] Guffels: ok now its doomed right?
[1:10:37] Guffels: wow impressive
[1:10:39] wolfshime: WOW

[1:13:14] CaptainBoop: gmgm
[1:13:31] Guffels: i love the way this paladin presses defensives. the sac ds combo is sick
[1:14:04] maenkins: AlienDance AlienDance AlienDance AlienDance
[1:14:39] sw0ngs: @Guffels making defensives do dmg is a great way to compel dps to press those buttons :D
[1:16:50] ren0m: Is today the day?
[1:17:12] Lara_TV_: Hey JB, you mind showing enemy damage on the flourishing ancient?
[1:17:22] maenkins: EZ Clap
[1:17:32] joffrey0101: feels like the ancien was dying so fast... on my keys I have to heal for ages
[1:17:33] therealborko: jb there's no music on the youtube stream lol
[1:17:35] Exogenesis9: @sw0ngs Ret paladin on Rashok was a minigame of surfing lava waves to routinely pop SoV inside ES.
[1:17:52] Lara_TV_: Ty <3
[1:17:58] rezthumb: which W/A shows the aoe stops cds?
[1:18:26] ErikJugend: Where do you find the mixes?
[1:18:30] jdotb: https://wago.io/e0Kh-Te38/2
[1:18:43] ErikJugend: ah ok
[1:18:43] rezthumb: thanks jdotb
[1:19:10] Lara_TV_: I think Ret was holding for it, he knows what's up
[1:19:15] Lara_TV_: They only need to hold 5s each time
[1:19:24] Guffels: the ret was kinda smurfing that whole key
[1:20:04] Exogenesis9: I think he nosedived into fire/ice twice on third boss, so maybe not the whole key.
[1:20:31] vilewow: are your usual teammates in mdi prison? or do you pug most of your keys
[1:20:31] ren0m: Out of curiosity, since I need to replace it as well - how much did the roof cost and what's the size of it?
[1:20:46] Lara_TV_: It's 100% people actually holding for add
[1:21:11] Trair: ret CDs line up for add every time
[1:21:13] Lara_TV_: People underestimate the 4x damage amp
[1:21:21] treavorthenusance: dinossH da damn son dinossH  roofs aint cheap
[1:21:31] Lara_TV_: No point in using cds on boss when your filler will do 4x the dam for longer
[1:21:40] TBouse: maybe saving CDs for add is the play for boss kill time
[1:21:42] ren0m: One of the things you learn when you get older is that everything is more expensive than you thought.
[1:21:53] Rypick: Do you have a Big Wigs profile import anywhere
[1:22:01] ren0m: I had to replace windows and I've yet to recover from it
[1:22:10] joffrey0101: yes that felt super smooth
[1:22:20] TBouse: ive never seen sub 6 on 28 tyran
[1:22:58] GigaforceTV: Did Fyrakk die?
[1:23:15] maenkins: 8% YEP
[1:23:21] sw0ngs: I saw a 7.8% xD
[1:23:47] maenkins: right there, just need to do the last seed!
[1:24:00] GigaforceTV: Arent all the seeds done by that point?
[1:24:04] GigaforceTV: ths 3 roars no?
[1:24:05] barkatdis: can you show healing breakdown
[1:24:09] GigaforceTV: thats*
[1:24:28] maenkins: oh yeah, should be
[1:24:43] GigaforceTV: and the meta is to burn two good seeds on first roar
[1:26:39] punkpuppy_13: leech does feel super useless
[1:26:55] erkol123: hey man, how u heal crushing deapths in TOTT?
[1:27:03] Jarlan23: ive been trying to stack avoidance tbh it seems to help more in m+
[1:27:09] Jarlan23: for me at least
[1:27:40] Guffels: tell your dps to los it lol
[1:27:49] erkol123: ty
[1:27:53] Araxiwow: u can check all realm prices for BOEs
[1:27:53] sw0ngs: but you still wont put a rejuv on them
[1:28:02] vilewow: @Guffels can't los anymore
[1:28:15] Pinslate: at a certain level crushing depths is a group mechanic
[1:28:19] Rypick: Can you export your Big Wigs profile please asking for a friend hahaha
[1:28:20] Guffels: @Guffels shows how long its been since i gave up filling my vault
[1:28:26] Pinslate: gota yell at ppl to heal themselves or off healers to help
[1:28:27] ayydooo: does anyone ever feel a bit of anxiety going into higher keys as healer, like can i heal through this
[1:29:04] vilewow: higher the key, the less healing ngl
[1:29:23] Guarok: Weekly
[1:29:26] Guffels: do it

[1:44:26] Byaano: Good luck JB! :)
[1:44:28] tabxzer: is this a swedish song that they made into english or the other way around?
[1:45:00] toastbam: KEKVibe KEKVibe
[1:45:18] toastbam: @tabxzer its an english song originally
[1:45:26] osmohouse: I need some tips, I've played Hpal main since like vanilla but I can't stand the current gameplay loop. What's a fun healer to play, that's quite different from Hpal?
[1:45:52] ren0m: Anything but monk
[1:46:19] Guffels: Mistweaver is based in keys but donkey to play in raid imo
[1:46:20] tabxzer: @osmohouse hpriest/discpriest/rshaman/rdruid is pretty fun
[1:46:20] kelly_mac06: ye pretty much
[1:46:26] ren0m: Disc is fun for some, since you're healing by doing dmg basically. I don't like it but I can see the appeal.
[1:46:34] tabxzer: @Guffels I am exactly the oppsite lol wtf
[1:46:38] kelly_mac06: legit you could pick any other than MW and have fun
[1:46:39] osmohouse: stonks
[1:47:03] Guffels: idk what the MW hate is. Fae Line + Spinning Crane kick is one of the best healing rotations in the game
[1:47:07] ren0m: For druid healing you can see on stream
[1:47:09] Guffels: Clouded Focus is ass cheeks
[1:47:10] osmohouse: It's just so miserable playing hpal now
[1:47:11] ren0m: Throw hots and dance
[1:47:16] osmohouse: yeye
[1:47:46] ren0m: You can throw in some singing as well
[1:48:13] Guffels: resto druid you have to really like the form shifting or else you do 0 dps
[1:49:12] osmohouse: anything that's more engaging than holy shock and flash of light with little else
[1:49:34] osmohouse: Tindral was a miserable experience, Fyrakk a lot better with the adds and toll combo
[1:49:36] ren0m: I would say druid, but I'm also biased
[1:49:55] Guffels: was this for keys or raid?
[1:50:03] nornh: @osmohouse I think tindral pre nerf was the best boss ive ever played
[1:50:05] osmohouse: Either or tbh
[1:50:08] nornh: boss was so sick
[1:50:12] osmohouse: since progg is done
[1:50:36] osmohouse: and I dont wanna touch my pal until they fix the dework
[1:51:30] kanyeeast79: im like the biggest World of Warcraft fan in the entire world
[1:51:32] Lara_TV_: @nornh this
[1:52:01] osmohouse: It wasn't all bad

[1:52:14] osmohouse: but I just didn't like the gameplay loop at all
[1:52:20] osmohouse: which has tainted this tier a lot for me
[1:52:49] Pinslate: sing this one jb

[1:54:09] nornh: fellow tindral enjoyer
[1:54:33] casualshame: casualshame subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Soon ny babe
[1:56:19] Celissah: Could you show quick how many interuppts it were during this boss? Seems to easy to heal compared to when I play. People are dropping way much more than this.
[1:56:27] Guffels: I recommend mistweaver to everyone this tier because its good for the first time in a while. kindof like an eclipse gotta experience it when you can. apparently its a polarizing class lol
[1:57:39] nornh: mw is so mid, buff mw
[1:58:27] blue321: How do u handle the 3pack in terms of interrupts with a 4 kick comp and no prot pala?
[1:58:59] kelly_mac06: @Guffels every key ive done with a MW has been smooth af
[1:59:02] kelly_mac06: and i pug a LOT
[1:59:24] Erebzion: playlist. @jdotb hit us up
[1:59:33] kelly_mac06: all my experiences with them have been so good but all the ppl i know who have played MW in previous tiers have quit and dont like it now lol
[1:59:58] kelly_mac06: @Erebzion !song is the command
[2:00:11] FarFromPort: Man, did ya'll see Echo with a 10 Everbloom on a 23 during MDI time trivals? Kind of crazy.
[2:00:35] nornh: cher is so sick
[2:00:36] sw0ngs: damn hearing that cher songs brings memories backs to the younger days

[2:02:36] Whitewolf1441: unavoidable damage should be looked at
[2:02:52] Karkesis: watching other classes able to heal this fight without worrying about how far away they are or what direction they're facing *cries in evoker*
[2:03:08] Erebzion: @kelly_mac06 yeh but cool once he’s done in here 😊
[2:03:08] kelly_mac06: @Karkesis oooof yea prevoker range is painful
[2:03:20] kelly_mac06: @Erebzion we'll try to hook you up friend
[2:03:34] Whitewolf1441: @Karkesis i guarantee you 100% theyre going to eventually make them 40 yards like everyone else
[2:03:44] Karkesis: god I hope so
[2:03:46] Guffels: pres is so cringe I hope it gets a good rework. i have never felt less mobile on a class
[2:04:03] kelly_mac06: @Karkesis man i hope so. it's why i dont even touch prevoker to be honest
[2:04:15] Guffels: I want an extra charge of tip the scales
[2:04:19] Guffels: bare minimum
[2:04:23] kelly_mac06: @Guffels they have some really cool utility but like the range hurts
[2:04:32] whiskeyhide: does everyone take more hits from cinderstorm if someone is dead?
[2:04:50] kelly_mac06: @jdotb is there a link to the whole playlist you're using now? !song just gives the name but no link
[2:04:55] Karkesis: I believe so @whiskeyhide
[2:04:57] yenny__: its a set amount of bolts per set, if someone is dead others take more

[2:05:45] kelly_mac06: @Erebzion there you go friend! enjoy
[2:05:48] Eatmeillidan: mom trapz :D
[2:05:50] yenny__: i read something like that its 16 bolts per set? and since its a party of five everyone will take 3 and a random person will take 4
[2:05:51] kelly_mac06: thnks JB
[2:06:08] kelly_mac06: @yenny__ oh that makes sense. i saw a discussion about cinderbolt yesterday
[2:06:16] kelly_mac06: about trying to mitigate
[2:07:06] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:07:14] flowerpwrxd: i thought u were having a heart attack
[2:07:16] razortanktv: you know whats good for shoulder pain?
[2:07:41] qyxiz: @yenny__ could theoretically have 3 people take 4 bolts and the others take 2 each too
[2:07:44] Celissah: @jdotb Mind checking how many interrupts were thrown during Ancient Protectors? Seemed so easy to heal.
[2:08:26] qyxiz: 3.2
[2:09:06] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:10:02] qyxiz: 3 people alive means you can get 6 bolts
[2:10:58] wolfshime: its amazing that you lived the 28 with 3 ppl alive for so long
[2:10:59] Rebemma: I hope they will nerf EB it is a nightmare for me
[2:11:34] yenny__: and if you are unlucky it doesnt pace them out but just fcking dumps 3 of them on you in a row
[2:12:21] kelly_mac06: there was a long discussion in discord about cinderbolt
[2:12:24] maenkins: and that's not mitigated by aoe dr effects like feint, ya?
[2:12:26] yenny__: defo one of the spiciest tyran bosses just because of those shenanigans
[2:12:30] kelly_mac06: and mitigation
[2:12:44] madtrade2600: it still blow my mind that this boss ain't fixed to send a determined amount of bolt
[2:12:57] Protracks: it definitely dies tonight for sure
[2:13:09] madtrade2600: the random part is super triggering
[2:13:10] Celissah: Sorry for asking again. Mind checking how many interrupts were thrown during Ancient Protectors? Seemed so easy to heal.
[2:13:45] kitty0chi: !amd
[2:14:00] TVeeezy: @jdotb if you're 486 ilvl, can you do 31s? or is there a level of gear yto need at that key level?

[2:17:41] Protracks: you could have just said it's harder to get into groups with bad gear you ain't need to do all this
[2:17:51] Rypick: Peacocking
[2:18:05] ren0m: No, this is better @Protracks LUL
[2:18:20] TVeeezy: there is nothing more infuriating than seeing a 480+ missing enchants
[2:18:24] TVeeezy: auto kick for me
[2:18:45] ChimeraHU: noone should ever miss enchants, they are so cheap
[2:19:08] ren0m: There's nothing more infuriating than not getting invited because you don't have high enough iLvL and then you need to run lower M+ to get better gear.
[2:19:37] TVeeezy: well, if the stone is high enough, ilvl literally matters
[2:19:53] JacobBose: Rng aint that bad lol
[2:20:01] ren0m: Well I'm at 460 and I'm hardly getting invited to +16s

[2:21:57] leubinator: its the same drama as every nfl offseason
[2:22:08] leubinator: we tag u if u want to leave
[2:22:27] Protracks: no
[2:22:33] FarFromPort: Kind of
[2:22:34] Protracks: they have other things like transfer fees
[2:22:39] FarFromPort: They have Financial Fair Play
[2:22:52] ren0m: ^
[2:22:56] leubinator: its obviously not exactly the same but same energy
[2:23:20] flowerpwrxd: @FarFromPort financial fair play is like mage nerfs, only a slap on the wrist
[2:24:09] vilewow: soccer had a thing where if you went over budget they'd fine you, but clubs were so rich they didn't care, essentially having "no salary cap"
[2:24:29] FarFromPort: I mean---ask Barca how that worked out for them?
[2:24:36] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:25:13] FarFromPort: They had that transfer embargo last year.
[2:25:26] ren0m: It's not that extreme but they wouldn't be able to do it nearly as well
[2:25:49] ren0m: Striker has been kicking the ball all his life, defender has been kicking strikers all his life
[2:25:54] TrevorSaurusrex13: not to mention the vast difference in physique for each position in football
[2:26:23] Sykeasaurus: jb how do u stay so handsome man, whats ur secret?
[2:26:46] leubinator: have u tried having a right guard play wide reciever?he might not be fast but try to takle that mf
[2:26:51] Tharayel: whats still the plan for this week? EB + WM?
[2:27:14] ren0m: And M+ stress keeps him sharp
[2:27:26] dragona92: GIve me that pep talk - how does one take on being benched professionally instead of getting pissed Sadge
[2:27:26] maenkins: nah, you can smell the difference between soda
[2:27:44] Sizebot: I could tell you they're different but I doubt I could name the brand
[2:27:51] yrwenlol: Not even if its like the Vanilla or cherry coke?
[2:27:59] Tharayel: same as Sizebot

[2:29:23] dragona92: Do they really not look at it? 🤯
[2:29:39] Remnxnt: only when someone is mad at you
[2:29:44] Remnxnt: and turn into a PI
[2:29:54] yrwenlol: doubt anyone care if u get it by week 14 or 18...
[2:30:01] kelly_mac06: oh wait i was afk did you get benched?
[2:30:22] dragona92: KEKL
[2:30:28] whiskeyhide: sitting nzoth prog was great
[2:30:32] whiskeyhide: come back 3 months later to get free CE
[2:30:45] miichael___: But thats because you dont like raiding right
[2:30:51] kelly_mac06: ah so still stuck raiding
[2:30:52] kelly_mac06: sadge
[2:30:52] miichael___: you just raid as a means to M+
[2:30:54] yrwenlol: Tindral was quite fun imo, But fyrakk man that boss is killing my will to play healer
[2:30:59] Sykeasaurus: are u based out of EU or just play on EU servers?
[2:31:06] maneatingpotato1: !eu

[2:31:09] Galarian_Hp: yeah im at tintral atm, even now that fight sucks because of p1
[2:31:18] mechabunx: tindral is just cheap mechanic vomit, not fun at all
[2:31:20] dragona92: @miichael___ Probably true, I do enjoy the process of progging pull by pull
[2:31:20] maneatingpotato1: !benched
[2:31:23] kelly_mac06: it's funny, i know ppl who LOVE the tindral fight and i dont understand why
[2:31:46] Deyoe: Im a mistweaver 300 pulls in and having a blast on tindral. shrug
[2:31:50] yrwenlol: I was the Holy pally ;)
[2:32:07] Galarian_Hp: i cant remember a fight with a less fun progression curve as Tindral
[2:32:37] maenkins: KEKW
[2:32:38] FarFromPort: Um... what?
[2:32:44] yrwenlol: Dispell is the thing i throw at ppl when they run away for some reason
[2:32:46] Deyoe: ohh you must be the disc priest kekw
[2:32:48] gergrunt: every1 who plays disc this tier seems like they wanna jump off a cliff. maybe the spec is just a misery hole
[2:32:50] miichael___: I got dispelled a lot
[2:32:56] miichael___: i thought it was ok
[2:32:56] FarFromPort: @Deyoe 100% lol
[2:32:59] miichael___: better than fyrakk
[2:33:14] Suka025: @gergrunt I would say the same for resto druid KEKW
[2:33:42] ErikJugend: I have a friend who's played disc for tons of CEs and he's said after this tier he will never play disc again
[2:33:44] Galarian_Hp: disc may be fun in m+, raid disc may be the worst u could play if u want fun
[2:34:36] miichael___: Venhyr Moonkin Disc Priest
[2:34:42] cyn_x: on god
[2:34:47] cyn_x: ur speaking facts
[2:34:50] trbotubbo: S2 Disc was way superior
[2:35:05] Guffels: 30 second ramps on smolderon was fun for the first 100 pulls but im very over it
[2:35:17] Deyoe: @trbotubbo S2 disc didnt exist
[2:35:47] trbotubbo: @Deyoe It was in the "good but not top" tier
[2:35:49] Suka025: From what Ive seen the only ranged healers having fun this tier is shaman. Chain heals goes brrr
[2:36:05] Galarian_Hp: so btw there are Fyrakk kills without disc priests
[2:36:07] ErikJugend: He also gets really tilted by all the movement on Fyrakk cuz we don't have a prot pally so he can't get spell warding
[2:36:18] dragona92: As a druid I've always been wanted in raid due to my innervate but now it feels so stupid that u don't want more than a mark FeelsBadMan

[2:38:43] ren0m: I don't know how it's called
[2:38:51] Deyoe: Aspect Crests?
[2:38:53] Sizebot: you would lose the socket if you don't have the tokens for one already
[2:38:59] the_general01: the_general01 gifted a Tier 1 sub to destiny25! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[2:39:15] ren0m: Could be that, yes
[2:39:17] leubinator: i hope they work on the crafting system for 11.0 again its just half cooked
[2:39:22] ren0m: The item that makes so the item is higher iLvL
[2:39:40] Deyoe: @ren0m No, send into ilvl upgrades then craft 486
[2:39:55] progonitelj: i hope you kill fyrakk tonight
[2:40:19] leubinator: u can craft at 463 and recraft it with aspects later but thats expensive @ren0m
[2:40:26] ren0m: We're grinding M+ hoping for drops then
[2:40:44] ren0m: Which sounds like a super fun activity for the weekend
[2:41:04] Deyoe: @leubinator Thats also a waste of crests
[2:41:29] dragona92: @leubinator They said they will, it's gonna be smth similar but we'll see what the improvements will be
[2:41:31] leubinator: @Deyoe how u don't need anything but the spark for 463
[2:41:34] somohh: should I take 483 pips trinket with leech or 489 raal's rib cloak for my holy paladins vault

[2:42:57] progonitelj: i never asked , where did you learned or from who to play like this ?
[2:43:00] Deyoe: You have to be used to the ping by now that i doesnt matter
[2:43:09] jdotb: https://wago.io/RCVtPLUrF/39
[2:43:18] Wiigglles: ty! <3
[2:43:27] Phasedr: learned from the greatest (me)
[2:43:32] leubinator: will dorki win vs echo again this weekend
[2:43:45] leubinator: Sadge
[2:43:58] the_general01: very unlikely
[2:44:08] Guffels: wow is one of those games where it takes multiple season to integrate. never met anyone who just gets m+ title in their very first season
[2:44:10] savagedoodle: i was watching old vids seen you did mdi before why not this year
[2:44:11] leubinator: not believing into the drogoh resto druid smh
[2:44:16] Guffels: !mdi
[2:44:17] StreamElements: Still looking for team
[2:44:17] progonitelj: will there be in anytime sometime who will beat echo in dungeons ?
[2:44:59] the_general01: @progonitelj theyve already been beaten fren
[2:45:17] dragona92: Dorki & Co beat them some time ago, no?
[2:45:19] Calair_: I mean they've taken cup losses. They just then also take that personally and destroy in finals right after
[2:45:24] dragona92: Well not in the Grand Finals but still
[2:45:32] savagedoodle: was a ad if you said something :(
[2:45:48] Insivius: good luck on killing the spicy nasty boy tonight!
[2:46:04] savagedoodle: oh gotchu
[2:46:23] Oreten710: as disc in raid, do I focus on keeping like 50% of the raid atoned? I feel like Im always putting up atones at the wrong time
[2:46:38] progonitelj: do they invite you only when resto druid is meta or something ?
[2:47:06] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:47:08] Guffels: @Oreten710 no lol. disc in raid you get 20 atones out for a MB or SF cooldown window then forget the raid frames exist till cooldowns are back up
[2:47:12] Insivius: resto druid is pumping
[2:47:23] Insivius: kitty stonks out of control
[2:48:09] Guffels: the only thing I use to help with atonement was a WA i made that highlights people missing atonement when they are the last 5 without it
[2:48:13] Insivius: elvui has good buff tracking in party / raid frames.
[2:48:34] zani_eu: time for dinner and watching Raid, how could it be better? :D
[2:48:36] Oreten710: @Guffels so pretty much just gotta know the fight, when dmg comes out and burst heal?
[2:49:07] TVeeezy: need a clasp??
[2:49:39] TVeeezy: at whgat point did you start taking the currency over loot?
[2:49:39] Guffels: @Oreten710 yeah you dont really do a fight on disc without have every single radiance usage planned and on a timer. its degenerate af but it makes the class pop off
[2:50:07] Guffels: @TVeeezy from vault? when the loot isnt an upgrade
[2:50:28] Oreten710: @Guffels gotcha, makes sense
[2:50:59] Wiigglles: im just opening my vault as Guardian now in hopes HC fyrakk is in it
[2:51:15] Mageulook_69: raid when
[2:51:41] Oreten710: @jdotb what is your favorite ability in wow

[2:53:38] JPAzS71121: Convoke and SLT are sorta my ultimate "feel good" buttons
[2:54:06] Wiigglles: as Rdruid should i replace a 489 vers/mast leech OH with a crafted hast/vers OH? @jdotb
[2:54:07] Guffels: I think if covenant abilities and the renown wasnt tied together and the ability could be changed at will, it could have been the best expac ever
[2:54:23] professor_cullman: spirit of redemption a banger too
[2:54:25] shorty8435: @Wiigglles no
[2:54:28] KRAKNG1RD: Whats a good item lvl to start M+?
[2:54:50] nlaes: start of p2 is very common after the nerfs
[2:54:53] JPAzS71121: @KRAKNG1RD I started on alts at 380
[2:54:56] progonitelj: to push healing on adds probably
[2:55:00] Wiigglles: @shorty8435 ok ty
[2:55:03] OGpur3: @KRAKNG1RD u can start m+ at any ilvl like 380
[2:55:24] Fowly: It gets down tonight, I believe.
[2:55:38] Guffels: i would assume you need to lust p2 if you cant get it below 3 ad waves
[2:55:56] miichael___: whats your prog %
[2:55:59] Guffels: 8%
[2:56:00] KRAKNG1RD: @KRAKNG1RD alright thx
[2:56:04] erlenddddddd: hey does anyoen know how the Focused Tempest work in Throne? Is the jump damage reduced by distance ?
[2:56:11] KRAKNG1RD: @KRAKNG1RD thx
[2:56:50] Aakku: I know its just heroic strat, but speed kill strat is lusting p2 for the reasons they say.
[2:57:16] nlaes: you lust start of p2 as it lines up with most of the cds and the boss doesn't do anything. Its for boss damage. You couldnt really do it pre-nerf as you couldnt save all cds for it.
[2:58:12] Oreten710: love this boss room

[3:25:52] 水果攤: thanks!
[3:27:23] frazlord: Will this be the most pulls you've ever had on a mythic boss?
[3:28:49] 水果攤: last 5-7% is the most difficult stage imo, in bad days, you will only get couple pulls that you actually feel like you are progging
[3:28:51] zamow1994: i hate how hard they made these last 2 bosses
[3:28:59] 水果攤: other times, you just constantly wipes in P1 and P2
[3:29:04] 水果攤: even early stage P3
[3:29:05] Happycloudstv: bearsa9Surprised
[3:29:34] FinkTV: good luck in raid
[3:31:05] 水果攤: we took a good 2 weeks break after we first killed fyrakk. we will do our first reclear this week, and to be honest, i hate this boss
[3:31:21] Geekop_: bad boss
[3:31:26] kyleconfirm: True
[3:31:29] kyleconfirm: Boss is terrible
[3:31:46] 水果攤: tindral after the nerf is fine, its just a joke now for raid groups that can kill him before the nerf
[3:32:18] Nonyamuff: Kill that ho
[3:32:51] 水果攤: but this boss, full of mechanics that can kill a raid member, if no the entire raid every 5s

[3:38:51] ottomr1990: this fight feels like such dogshit that things can be so smooth and then the next server tick the whole raid is dead
[3:38:57] Protracks: 3 firestorms is bad GUID make a new character

[3:40:24] sw0ngs: Were you getting hyped that it was gonna die and get nervous?

[3:40:36] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:40:41] 水果攤: other wise you will go back to constantly wiping in P1

[3:41:41] MacRant: yapping
[3:41:48] majestictaco0: 415 pulls in still yapping about strat
[3:42:44] 水果攤: see what i meant
[3:43:06] Lovegrove_: jamdotb
[3:44:35] 水果攤: but for sure, any pull could be a kill at this point. just for that last couple percent, everyone needs to be picking up seeds and avoid all shits, if you see the damn seeds on the ground

[3:56:29] JPAzS71121: Why SF over Bender on this fight?
[3:57:16] Guffels: because thats what the Taiwanese discs did lol. in seriousness you need the extended damage window

[4:14:31] maneatingpotato1: Mythic Raiders are good hiring decisions.  They can take so much BS before the give up and quit.
[4:15:18] Guffels: that ranged doesnt? no but they have a harder time dropping tornados
[4:15:29] Emm_Zee: Melee has to stop strafing left and right with blazes which is harder than any ranged job in the game ngl
[4:15:36] Guffels: lol true
[4:15:40] Seikelos: blazes are much tougher in melee but otherwise it is monkey brain click enemy and hit
[4:15:47] Moonragery: NotLikeThis
[4:15:59] SirPikajew: Just dodge 5head
[4:16:03] treavorthenusance: i mean melee usually dosn't have to to mechs LOL
[4:16:03] nicoboot: how about they stop[ terrorist sniping their healers with lines mfers
[4:16:07] Gzaru: did you ranged people try not fucking up?
[4:16:10] Nonyamuff: Note to self...be melee
[4:16:10] treavorthenusance: thats mage and healer work
[4:16:14] sw0ngs: those are the same ppl in lfg saying its easy to do seeds, but never ever volunteer to do them lol
[4:16:26] Guffels: i hate when my melee raid lead bitches on smolderon about casters not baiting puddles. as if im gunna drop 5 gdcs to get to the group stack
[4:17:08] Mattyuh: losing 5 GCD is better than fucking it up for 19 people
[4:17:17] JPAzS71121: @sw0ngs See, I never say it's easy, but my guild knows well enough to trust me with nothing raid-wipingly important xD
[4:17:29] Emm_Zee: @Guffels It's also usually some clueless melee being on the wrong side of the boss baiting bad Sadge
[4:17:36] nicoboot: why are you on the dispell list with 3 other healers, ur globals are most important
[4:17:43] Spritesgud: @JPAzS71121 Did you just admit you're bad KEKW
[4:17:50] Guffels: @Guffels 100% this. i just started sending twitch clips during raid lol
[4:19:19] Guffels: its always funny to me to see people getting timespiral and still standing still to cast. its so hard to react to

[4:24:18] luxumbra69: jb  why are you here anymore? are you hoping for rageheart or just trying for the CE achieve? feel like this boss has very little value for healers, not to mention just fucking awful for them.
[4:24:21] madtrade2600: let him cook
[4:24:38] Guffels: @luxumbra69 just the CE angel
[4:25:00] Spritesgud: Prayge

[4:36:03] SighborgGaming: @Gzaru @Gzaru It's not the same at all after the nerfs though
[4:36:32] Piggymain: echo also had way worse gear
[4:36:38] Guffels: ??the most 'i got one-guyed' message of all time lol
[4:37:06] Guffels: its a very effective comparison because its the exact same. every pull gets close and each pull could be the kill

[4:42:15] SighborgGaming: @Guffels It's literally nowhere close to being comparable. They wiped because they had EIGHT seeds and a hard overlap which no longer exists, and there are only THREE corrupted seeds now. It's not even the same fight anymore lmao
