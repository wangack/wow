[1:30:19] bigshovels: @towelliee do you not feel Blizzard is realizing very few people are seeing that content and their design time is being wasted?
[1:31:25] stabzmcgeee: but still thats only what 20000 players that get to see it,, ouit of millions
[1:32:14] LemonDrizzleCakes: Are you levelling a warlock?
[1:32:20] bigshovels: @Towelliee I just feel like their player based has aged over the years.  What is average age of a wow subscriber and we do not have the time we once had.
[1:32:30] Rudric_Ice: at this point mythic raiding is for "esports players"
[1:32:45] Thunderbrew: Casual Players are usually ignored.
[1:33:03] stabzmcgeee: so 80000 players
[1:33:37] Thunderbrew: How many WoW players right now? A  couple million?
[1:33:40] mystic_dun: Is it true that diablo immortal already dead? I head they lost almost 80% pop is this true?

[1:35:52] NotEnoughMana: does 1% make sense
[1:35:58] stabzmcgeee: no it shouldnt be for everyone but thats alot of dev time put in for 2% of players,,, thats number needs to be like 20-30%

[1:40:16] Wcvechten: sofo was definitely hard
[1:40:22] Thoreya: a shame bc its such a beautiful raid
[1:40:28] Throttlez: My guild was rank 60ish when we killed halondrus. Then Anduin took us 35 days.
[1:40:38] NotEnoughMana: there was 2 end bosses on this tier and the rest of them was above average on difficulty LUL
[1:40:46] PvtHudson093: didnt help that blizz ramped up the heroic difficulty in Shadowlands

[1:43:42] Highparkk_: yep that sounds accurate
[1:43:54] Throttlez: We got anduin to final phase twice in our first 150 pulls. Then we didn't get to that last phase again until 350. Almost exclusively people missing kicks.
[1:44:00] Reklusion: So classic blizzard fuckup, overtune because of too much power LUL
[1:44:19] nvnto: There are so many guilds who never kill any of the later Mythic bosses again after their first kill. And the Great Vault kind of made it unnecessary.

[4:54:42] warrenny: Nah 10 is best amount
[4:54:49] wigglinjigglin: I think too many wipe mechanics to a single mistake by an individual
[4:55:02] jerexify: @Towelliee Got another Alliance one lined up.

[5:00:22] qtla: @Towelliee I think that mechanics should not happen based on boss Hp
[5:00:27] infinityarty: yhea, that basically removes whole mythic of p1
[5:01:05] exilethegamer: @towelliee how do you feel about having raids being more accessible to players and allowing a smaller group size? I don‚Äôt think a 5 man should be able to run it but I do think 2/2/6 should be baseline raid size to allow smaller guilds to run without having to pug

[5:41:21] Velashen: A lot of people are just obsessed with nostalgia and its former glory.
[5:41:42] Kisswani: I think the negativity affects people thinking on trying out WoW more than the ones playing it

[5:48:44] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: FF14 is far more revolutionary than aoc
[5:48:45] DragonofWolves: Game Engines have nothing to do with gameplay and system innovation.
[5:48:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having cities that develop based on what players do is cool
[5:49:11] N3llee: arguably Ashes is doing nothing new. Ideally they are taking some of the best idea systems from other games and bring it all into one game
[5:49:14] Windelius: one of the main reason wow is so popular is becos it doesnt require high end pc to play

[5:52:47] Throdio: One good way to see how WoW graphics evolved is to WotLK Dalaran, then Legion Dalaran
[5:52:48] DragonofWolves: Well its recommended by Blizz, I should say. Sorry I worded that statement wrong.
[5:52:48] fewyn: or did they shut it down?

[6:00:38] geros2013: One of the advantages of WoW and one of the reasons it was always popular was you did not need 3090 to run it. You can basically run it with no graphic card
[6:00:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is a strongpoint of WoW, though, that you can still play it fine on an old ass laptop
