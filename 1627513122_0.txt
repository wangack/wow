[1:04:28] Pallananana: Did twitch change something regarding ads? Getting ass blasted with 6-7 ads per half hour feels like KEKW
[1:04:29] DovahChicken: oh okay thats somthing i can go from! cheers bud! : D
[1:05:02] Pallananana: Yikes, oh well KEKW
[1:05:35] Featherbow: I'd jump in on my healer but I have to leave soon :(

[1:06:26] zyppeli: God bless adguard
[1:06:38] luckfore: which adblocker do you use
[1:06:48] rhsiuol: when that happens I just leave the stream
[1:06:49] Zucchey: You even get adds as a sub so not surprised
[1:06:50] Opti87: I just joined this stream, had 2 to start, 20 sec later 8 ads LUL
[1:07:04] Aquadriel: use twitchtv ad blocker, look for it like that.
[1:07:06] Orirholim: @Zucchey i think that was a bug
[1:07:14] Pallananana: i don't mind tbh, wish they'd make a minimum effort to make them more enjoyable though
[1:07:16] maustercheese: for me the "usual" ad blockers did not work on the twitch ads
[1:07:20] Featherbow: you always get ads when you join a stream
[1:07:27] SinicalDev: My mate works for a laptop manufacturer and the amount twitch were charging in 2021 when he showed me their deck was massive compared to other platforms
[1:07:34] Allvarez: dude i just got twitch nitro
[1:07:36] Allvarez: no ads
[1:07:38] Allvarez: 8.99
[1:07:41] Youredoneson666: if i can't watch twitch without ads, i'll just stop watching twitch
[1:08:04] LSBreed: does using an ad blocker hurt the streamer?
[1:08:05] Zucchey: @Orirholim A very convenient bug
[1:08:05] maustercheese: like they are clever on how they have things layered trying to hide you being able to block the ads manually
[1:08:11] Exodeo_: I just afk during the adds or mute them tbh
[1:08:19] neverbornlucky: so Towelliee said stay with Panda got you
[1:08:38] touchofpinkfizz: i remember watching F! with ads!! Now that was bad
[1:08:39] Orirholim: I pretty much have Twitch Turbo/Youtube Premium nowadays. The ads got enough to be an annoyance.
[1:08:43] Updul: twitch premium to avoid all ads like youtube premium
[1:08:50] CodyKane: Morning!
[1:08:52] Pallananana: huge deck
[1:09:03] SinicalDev: because he works for their marketing department so runs ads
[1:09:10] maustercheese: as someone who used adguard before to try and get them and found out some about how they have things structured
[1:09:11] LSBreed: big deck bandits
[1:09:47] Keyastaron_: btw yr loot spec is fury? lmao
[1:09:50] Diecast669: ads don't bother me, still free entertainment while I'm at work lo

[1:16:20] Thoreya: they announced the SL delay with how much time remaining till the expac launched
[1:16:22] Thoreya: ?
[1:16:23] Pallananana: That's scary
[1:16:32] SinicalDev: no work orders kek
[1:16:34] Herzenliegen: @king_bam03  240 hours
[1:16:43] remixonfire91: @Thoreya like 2 months before lunch
[1:16:47] Orirholim: little over 5 1/2 yeah
[1:17:00] realnzall: @Towelliee Do you think a delay might happen? My concern is that a delay would probably have to mean prepatch in January to ensure devs are free to fix shit, and I don't think there's enough that needs fixing in DF to justify a 10 week delay
[1:17:02] Thoreya: @remixonfire91 thats why i feel like its not gonna be delayed
[1:17:03] remixonfire91: launch*
[1:17:04] Exodeo_: Someone on retail is begging for 1k gold in Org atm..
[1:17:09] Jelanipatron: yes.. lmao
[1:17:11] king_bam03: ahh okay looking forward to it, Thank you @Herzenliegen @touchofpinkfizz

[1:17:32] DovahChicken: All Bots KEKW
[1:17:46] LSBreed: you were 6th on dmg ouch...
[1:17:59] Thoreya: @mavericks312 the wow devs are always on crunch during expac launches, its not really any different
[1:18:00] Vordreon: boosted to death.
[1:18:01] mavericks312: they hit a target once and then go afk
[1:18:10] Herzenliegen: Good luck!
[1:18:13] krakenfaces: this is true hardmode
[1:18:15] Exodeo_: Can we take bets on determination stacks? Kappa
[1:18:18] DovahChicken: or gamer dads and moms that have 1 hour a year to play KEKW
[1:18:28] AthenaP47: knock all the afk people off the platform, lol
[1:18:29] Keyastaron_: and you got me doing 15K dps Kappa
[1:18:33] maustercheese: you got this right?
[1:18:39] mavericks312: @Thoreya true but in the blue post from last week it sounded like they wanted it to be delayed
[1:19:27] DarkBeasty_: Good morning djpodzLoveit
[1:19:48] AthenaP47: i got that mount on our first trip in on normal, was great
[1:19:52] DarkBeasty_: anyone know why the downtime is so long today ?
[1:20:05] Katrikan: @Towelliee I was going through the warrior's talents the other day, did they remove the Venthyr execute effect?
[1:20:18] Orirholim: preparation for pre-patch most likely, backend updates, etc
[1:20:22] Justintegra31: @DarkBeasty_ probably preloading pre-patch to the servers
[1:20:29] DarkBeasty_: oh yeahhh
[1:20:52] Dirt3y: top two tanks for DF?
[1:20:53] ZeroNpcTV: how long is server downtime? 1  hour?

[1:21:22] Dcarter: These ff14 criterion dungeons look good
[1:21:30] Katrikan: @Towelliee I'm only asking because of that sick animation it had. I'm gonna miss it
[1:21:33] Sabusajin: !Drops
[1:21:37] LearnedSomething: I hope they give that thing a deep cleaning in 8 hours
[1:21:46] LearnedSomething: scrub those circuits good
[1:21:53] AthenaP47: the benefits of working night shift, i'm never awake during maintenance
[1:21:58] Orirholim: they could be doing some low pop server mergers, aren't they due to do that?
[1:22:08] Orirholim: or rather, connections
[1:22:14] Justintegra31: LFR must be a nightmare on healers
[1:22:14] Jelanipatron: Monk on beta feels so much better than retail lol

[1:25:37] ZeroNpcTV: @greedysob i think until DF comes out
[1:25:58] greedysob: cool
[1:26:41] Orirholim: xp buff goes away on pre-patch
[1:26:42] heyitsken_: 0%
[1:26:46] DarkBeasty_: if i have a lvl 60 token i guess i'll not be able to use it on evoker ?
[1:27:07] abracka_: @DarkBeasty_ no reason to, they start at lv 58 and you are 60 by the time you leave the starting zone
[1:27:11] AthenaP47: its lfr, of course someone took the stun thing
[1:27:12] ZeroNpcTV: on pre-patch? damn i still got 2 char to level
[1:27:20] jerexify: Why is that, @Towelliee ? Why wouldn't they leave it up until expansion launch?

[1:28:14] Justintegra31: What addon is that Raid Control button? If it is a WeakAura, which one is it?
[1:28:17] heyitsken_: You could have lied and told me this was mythic by the slow burn. Wait till sylvanas LUM
[1:28:19] heyitsken_: LUL
[1:28:29] neverbornlucky: Always blame the healer not the tank
