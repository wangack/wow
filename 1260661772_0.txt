[0:50:24] PandaSmuggl3r: As long as you're happy with 13 then stay with that!
[0:50:27] conradical93: do you have Hand of Rag?

[0:50:29] arakeee: could you do it in 3 weeks with less hours grinding?
[0:50:35] foxun9: Hand of Rag is better than r14 weaps. And spelldmg dagger you can get AB exalted
[0:50:36] aviduser2: people raid MC a year without seeing hand of rag

[0:51:22] Ranger420Mike: 8h a day grind would mean around 400k honor a week
[0:51:32] Sylvanwing: haven't watched WoW in a long time. Are feral druids still irrelevant?
[0:51:40] PinFromOrion: Why does Shaman doesnt need Rank 14 ?
[0:52:05] JonesJB: WRONG, the just changed the loot drop from early patch to late patch

[0:52:09] EuphoricH4mster: did they say that in a blue post?
[0:52:09] aviduser2: yes they increased HOJ but thats not because SOM. It was increased in later patches

[0:52:29] zuboco: @swifty reach rank 14 with 8h/day its a great challenge
[0:52:30] IdolizeAU: HOJ drop rates are not increased. They are the same that they were at the end of vanilla wow which was increased from earlier phases
[0:52:31] JonesJB: Its the later patch, HoJ from emperor not angerfogre
[0:52:35] Tizex87: the drop rates have not been changed

[8:17:25] Metalicat206: you need the procc tables to answer your question
[8:17:35] Razlee: chance
[8:17:41] Metalicat206: depends on effects you have on crit
[8:17:43] Eztoonv: its how its done for spells
[8:17:46] DextrousSlime: Increases likelihood of crit. NOT crit damage
[8:17:47] Eztoonv: its % crit chance

[8:18:25] Eztoonv: because it also increases the chance for example that the hand of rag fireball crits as well
[8:18:28] ChuudotGaming: will you get the nifty stopwatch and the skull of impending doom eventually? @Swifty
[8:18:37] Metalicat206: its a higher chance to procc an effect on crit
[8:18:40] Eztoonv: thats an effect crit chance
[8:18:48] Cristav: I think it and spell hit have similar wording
[8:18:57] Cristav: pretty sure spell exclusive

[8:19:09] Metalicat206: sssssshhh
[8:19:11] ChuudotGaming: spells
[8:19:12] kirbyspicywiener69: healing abilities maybe?
[8:19:12] 1h0Lt: instead of 10% chance for lightning bolt, it will be 15% chance
[8:19:13] Metalicat206: its a secret
[8:19:17] Metalicat206: only proccit knows
[8:19:17] hoodai: chain lightning
[8:19:18] d4rkirby: extra 5% to crit on procc
[8:19:20] Nekomemi: the armor on heal and a 2nd LB
[8:19:32] Lotsovkhaos: according to wowhead, critical effect chance is damage % when you crit
[8:19:39] AvengerDK: it's just 5% crit -.-
[8:19:49] MMzewall: You're overthinking it :P It is just simply chance to crit
[8:19:51] Metalicat206: healing focus on crit for example
[8:19:53] Eztoonv: its an effect crit chance
[8:19:55] CatDadKev: it's crit chance
[8:19:58] Eztoonv: and spells as well
[8:20:02] d4rkirby: rofl
[8:20:04] Taurenu: Stop confusing him chat
[8:20:06] ChuudotGaming: its lterally crit chance n othign else lmao

[8:20:44] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:20:51] Metalicat206: literally you need proccit and their tables and gear data to know
[8:20:54] rlab_dino: crit effect, meaning dmg?
[8:20:54] AvengerDK: just posted the effect
[8:21:11] d4rkirby: % to procc on critical effect of heals spells etc.
[8:21:13] Metalicat206: if you have a crit effect that does dmg then sure
[8:21:14] Domebuddy: Its because its only lightning and healing spells
[8:21:14] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:21:21] Domebuddy: Its showing for all of your spells
[8:21:22] Lotsovkhaos: IT's like gems for gear, crit effect chance is Damge/Healing % WHEN you crit
[8:21:23] bronx2old: your overall crit wont change...its only on lighning and healing spells
[8:21:27] m3dge: it's not shown either on sixtyupgrades the char creator page, it's just 6% you gotta add to your own crit % it's scuffed
[8:21:29] Metalicat206: @d4rkirby exactly correct
[8:21:35] DextrousSlime: So then it only works on effects triggered by crits then SOLVED
[8:21:36] AvengerDK: it's only for lightning spells (and healing)
[8:21:37] Eztoonv: Lightning shiled is also affected thats why
[8:21:40] Cristav: if it's like spell resist it'd be in its own catagory
[8:21:40] Eztoonv: shield*
[8:21:52] Tehdoze42069: if you could check the crit of only healing or lightning spells it would show
[8:22:01] Cristav: *or spell damage
[8:22:15] Metalicat206: @Eztoonv are you an eldritch outsider of the council??
[8:22:16] Eztoonv: Lightning shield is affected as well @Swifty  that's why its written that way
[8:22:18] Crimson__Clover: the question is, is the critical effect chance per hit ?
[8:22:21] ChuudotGaming: it is
[8:22:22] Metalicat206: no one knows that
[8:22:23] realboondawg216: Maybe towards clear cast or ancestrual fort?
[8:22:23] HeinziTroe: jooo, grats, done ranking?
[8:22:24] AnimefreakSweden: I've always understood it to be just pure crit % so im pretty sure thats what it is
[8:22:27] ChuudotGaming: you use alot of healing and nature spells
[8:22:30] m3dge: only if you are casting light bolts & chain lights
[8:22:30] ChuudotGaming: it will apply to that only
[8:22:32] Nekomemi: The effect is , a procc that a spell has as a 2nd ability. like the 25% chanse to gain armor from Ancestral healing.
[8:22:33] bonyato: How long did it take to get av exalted?
[8:22:35] Metalicat206: I would if you want lightning shield 100% uptime
[8:22:38] thebarkitect: WUT effects does shaman get when it crits?>
[8:23:00] Metalicat206: lightning shield + crit + procc CDR

[8:23:38] Metalicat206: or even chain lightning crit to proc lightning shield
[8:23:43] Eztoonv: thats an effect
[8:23:59] citramate: lighting shield can't crit
[8:24:03] AvengerDK: just think of it as +5% crit to LB and CL

[10:31:36] wethetv: swifty mate, you weren't even allowed into a good raiding guild unless you had full consumes and DM buffs, WBuffs, and you would get -dkp if you lacked buffs or consumes in classic on EU
[10:31:47] Metalicat206: oh yeah most of you are sub 350 and I have 400 alstats
[10:31:47] wethetv: I am totally fine with just consumes.

[10:34:03] Lonnert: @wethetv Sorry to say, but there were always guilds and pugs not needing wbuffs. the change from classic to SOM is that consumables like firewater etc became more trivial since those are the new wbuffs in quote
[10:34:05] Siyreouz: everyone in mid again
[10:34:28] Metalicat206: ZG so much better

[11:26:17] tywizdom: 😂😂😂😂
[11:26:17] moppis_world: i take both and let the second line empty, so no points in earth grasp and the dmg reduction
[11:26:21] desrtdust: and oyu dont run tidal focus
[11:26:33] Justapiccolo_eu: Swift I think as ele shaman u run out of mana anyway so
[11:26:45] guaskamole: welcome to shaman
[11:26:46] Rastolor: 400 mana per spell adds up over time
[11:27:07] desrtdust: exactly oyu are oom rly fast anyway this talent are just waste because oyu can do 1 more spell
[11:27:14] eKzeee: You don't place nova totem that often as an ele... only when your positioning is kinda off
[11:27:41] desrtdust: @eKzeee unless oyu are tauren then oyu use oit very often
[11:27:42] 99PGZ99: I stopt playing shadow prist because of mana problems … 50% of playtime is drinking
[11:27:50] ImMunke: Totemic focus is nice too. I usually run tidal focuz and then totemic focus. As elemental you use lesser healing waves instead of healing waves most of the time no?
[11:27:52] sunnybits: @Swifty u trying out full ele now or why we respeccing?
[11:27:56] desrtdust: it does so much dmg in combination with stomp and ele mastery
[11:28:05] eKzeee: @eKzeee together with stomp, yea
[11:28:12] Enmael00: 90% of playtime for boomkin is drinking too

[11:28:46] EncrypticMethods: call of flame 3/3 and imp fire totems is incredible I was messing around with it a while ago, but there are a lot of tradeoffs for hybird ele/resto
[11:29:29] eKzeee: @Swifty put away the point in devastation
[11:29:41] 0ceansx: if u want points to play with don't get reverberation
[11:29:48] TheRealDrGi: i mean,the stoneclaw and earthbind totem is not worth

[11:31:17] honey_bunnzz: I feel hit is important because they resist a lot or what I've seen in your stream
[11:31:18] desrtdust: 5% more crit chance
[11:31:19] EncrypticMethods: and fire nova totem is hella mana too but it all depends on meta playstyle , if you really want super fast damage
[11:31:25] TheRealDrGi: @Swifty you do realise that "lightning spells" is not shocks
[11:31:29] sunnybits: its just crit chance
[11:31:31] eKzeee: @Swifty it's crit, you can see it when you check your char stats
[11:31:34] sunnybits: weirdly worded
[11:31:37] Doral08: @swifty  been a very long time since I've watched your stream. in fact it was back when you moved into the "first gaming house" watching from my cell phone since my Walmart special PC from 2004 cant keep up and let me watch from it lol
[11:31:44] TheValiantFox: Probably just inconsistent naming of "crit"
[11:31:45] Cerrad123: crit effect != crit chance
[11:31:51] TheClane: it s only for lightning
[11:31:54] desrtdust: @Swifty permission to link specc pls.. and it gives 5% more crit to your lightning spells aka chain lighting and lightining bolt and healing spells
[11:31:57] TheClane: it s crit chance
[11:32:00] TheClane: only for lightning
[11:32:03] sunnybits: @Cerrad123 crit effect chance = crit chance
[11:32:11] TheRealDrGi: its crit chance for lightningbolt and CL NOT shocks
[11:32:12] TheClane: you don t see it there
[11:32:16] TheRealDrGi: and heals
[11:32:17] TheClane: cause it s only for lightning
[11:32:20] TheClane: not all u r spels
[11:32:21] desrtdust: for lighting and healing only
[11:32:23] 420fourtwenty420: that was my raid LOL

[11:34:07] WoWitzBron: basc when u crit it can do more dmg
[11:34:15] mrpants_1: it'ss just poorly worded crit chance
[11:34:18] solstixeK1: if you have 10, it will be 11 for 1 rank
[11:34:18] desrtdust: it does
[11:34:20] TheRealDrGi: its worded differently because it doesnt include shocks!!
[11:34:21] szimontv: No itll make your mastery be good
[11:34:23] the_uruk_hai: does enhance first talent row increases your intellect?
[11:34:37] mrpants_1: they are so inconsistent with this stuff in classic
[11:34:37] sunnybits: yea chat stop spreading misinformation, its not crit damage, its crit chance %
[11:34:43] solstixeK1: its crit chance

[11:34:59] desrtdust: so no shocks
[11:35:02] nautike94: Love you switfy, keep up the amazing content brother.
[11:35:08] mrpants_1: ask in shaman disc?
[11:35:08] Greghar1: That talent increases ur bolt/chain crit but not shock crit, thats why its worded like that!
[11:35:12] TheRealDrGi: look at the wording on the elemental tree
[11:35:13] EncrypticMethods: @the_uruk_hai ancestral knowledge

[11:35:50] TheRealDrGi: it's really not
[11:36:00] sunnybits: @Swifty don't listen to these plebs, it's litterally just crit % on lightning + heals
[11:36:10] sneaky937: you want the crit hit if you're ele mastery
[11:36:10] solstixeK1: it is chance, not bonus crit effect
[11:36:18] sneaky937: the other one for NS build
[11:36:21] Greghar1: Are you making a shock build or general ele build?
[11:36:26] WoWitzBron: pretty much say u crit a CL and it does 1k crit if u took that talent wouldnt help ur crit chance but when u crit it would do say 1.5k instead
[11:36:27] Greghar1: because that looks like general ele build
[11:36:30] desrtdust: @Swifty it will give you flat % crit chance for your chaing lightning and for your lightning bolt. plus increased crit chance for healing spells
[11:36:36] desrtdust: not crit dmg just cirt chance
[11:36:39] poturito: yeah its easier if you just google it as i said lol
[11:36:41] solstixeK1: I mean 1% BONUS per rank would be pretty neglible since you have other trees that get like 50%
