[0:17:37] Eikus11: it gladly pay for a boost then level classic again haha
[0:17:50] BlueBeast33: I want to level a blood elf so I really hoping for fresh
[0:18:05] Anelit21: i mean its kinda weird, boosting a character to 58 is totally worth it in classic but not so for retail in my opinion lol
[0:18:08] fellscreens: @Towelliee no web cam? or broken

[0:21:52] Blas0n: @Kelticlore The 2d version is running underneth the 3d version and you can change it on the fly

[0:24:55] Kelticlore: I hope they learned from the Warcraft 3 release what NOT to do
[0:25:04] Lazugo: RESKIN
[0:25:05] RavenARPG: its a completely different approach from WC 3
[0:25:10] akia03: so did they anounce anything new?

[0:25:37] PvtHudson093: The Kyrian tmog is straight fire

[0:28:25] Blas0n: @Towelliee They are far behind i think due to covid
[0:28:41] dutchie76: BC classic is def release around the same time as Vanilla classic did
[0:28:49] Supers18: Towelliee what were ur thoughts on wow stuff for blizzcon? felt like it was underwhelming
[0:28:51] TheEnstraynomic: !loverocket
[0:28:55] Kahoolo: !tbc
[0:28:55] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc
[0:29:16] Alegnowar: true this blizzcon was very lite
[0:29:17] dutchie76: yep
[0:29:19] memnon94: @Towelliee do you like the hand mount ? I personally fcking love it :D
[0:29:30] oraclespyro: the cinematic though
[0:29:41] TheEnstraynomic: didn't BFA add flying in 8.2 though? or is that out of the norm for blizzard standards?
[0:29:46] Supers18: no CG cinematic
[0:29:53] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: !loverocket
[0:30:15] dutchie76: Archon is still alive too
[0:30:23] Dexter0908: no face cam?
[0:30:29] Lazugo: !cam
[0:30:29] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[0:30:32] Kelticlore: Anduin is being controlled by the jailer IMO
[0:30:38] dutchie76: i was watching it
[0:30:43] nephttv_: Neph__98 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[0:30:46] Gnral: pls dot show Kreygasm
[0:30:48] dutchie76: again
[0:31:06] dutchie76: feelsutherman
[0:31:11] Kyrrua: everyone is hoping to have at least one cg cinematic with new Anduin tho @Towelliee or its a bit of a waste
[0:31:15] CDubTheRIPper: you think the jailer knows that sylvanas is flakey?
[0:31:16] yerdlethespaceturtle: BOBA!
[0:31:24] dutchie76: this is some bs too
[0:31:28] rnaodmletetrs: regret in her eyes towards the end of this
[0:31:30] Kyrrua: I mean, cg anduin is litteraly leonardo di caprio young
[0:31:35] dutchie76: 4 generals and a major boss just taken out like that
[0:31:45] memnon94: Sylvanas will turn good again, but she will die, calling it :(
[0:31:47] Kyrrua: I want evil di caprio
[0:31:58] rnaodmletetrs: @memnon94 exactly what im thinking
[0:32:00] RavenARPG: Look at Uther when Anduin appears.
[0:32:01] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: yeah, this patch will be a lot bigger than people expect, flying so soon? lol
[0:32:37] Kyrrua: flying for farming wolrd quests faster, yay ! Kappa
[0:32:47] RavenARPG: Touching his scar as Anduin walks by. Arthas is the key. 100%
[0:33:02] imorster: Uther probobly will play the big role in the end raid as a kyrian covenant boss
[0:33:02] Supers18: 5 keys to the light the path boys, illgynoth whispers
[0:33:14] dutchie76: yea brother
[0:33:15] CDubTheRIPper: who is her brother again?
[0:33:16] Average_Stali: andu-arthas!
[0:33:17] Supers18: jailer
[0:33:18] Owlcopwn: the jailer is her brother
[0:33:28] Owlcopwn: all the leaders of the covenants and the jailer are related
[0:33:34] CDubTheRIPper: is that kalis-whatever her name is?
[0:33:39] RavenARPG: When he see Anduin he touches his scar. It has to be related with Arthas. Something is going on. Arthur soul trapped/controlling Anduin and Uther felt it.
[0:33:46] oraclespyro: @Towelliee so does this mean anduin is a soulbind?
[0:33:53] rnaodmletetrs: watch her eyes now when jailer speaks... looks like a lil regret
[0:34:01] Deathu: idk tbh the story doesn't feel right ot me... it feels cheep xD
[0:34:06] sumdude1974: AnduLich
[0:34:07] Alepouditsa: but uther is not there any more right? how come was he there still?
[0:34:09] Gnral: whers gul'dan when we need him BibleThumpp
[0:34:10] Supers18: Thats the new zone
[0:34:13] CDubTheRIPper: Kyrestia
[0:34:14] Owlcopwn: the new zone
[0:34:15] dutchie76: new zone

[0:34:18] CDubTheRIPper: the new zone
[0:34:19] Domi98_: the new zone
[0:34:20] Atrial_: new maw zone
[0:34:21] Lazugo: korthia
[0:34:22] doomester: @Towelliee new zone
[0:34:29] ArctosPrime: new zone
[0:34:33] Alepouditsa: what hapen to the time lane
[0:34:34] dutchie76: yep
[0:34:37] Owlcopwn: the covenants yeah
[0:34:39] Supers18: yeah'
[0:34:41] RavenARPG: Yeah
[0:34:47] Supers18: to open the spechular thing
[0:34:50] dutchie76: Primus, Queen, and venth
[0:34:51] Atrial_: who knows
[0:34:56] Kyrrua: @Towelliee So I guess one of the next step from the Jailer is "freeing" denathrius from his key, I mean cell LUL Truly freeing Kappa what a brother.
[0:34:57] BuddySinister: Jailer does the snap Kappa
[0:34:59] Lazugo: the first ones made 5 people to the pantheon of death
[0:35:03] dutchie76: wasnt it the first ones?
[0:35:05] Owlcopwn: I'm guessing the ekys allow them to dictate where souls go, so if he controls all four, he controls the shadowlands @Towelliee
[0:35:15] Lazugo: jailer and the 4 leaders
[0:35:31] indestructible123: collecting all 4 probably freeing himself from the Maw?
[0:35:32] Lazugo: nono
[0:35:42] PrimogenitureJ: I think its safe to assume he has Revendreth's key since denathrius openly worked with him...its probably the arbiter, winter queen, and the primus
[0:35:46] sumdude1974: Prob to release all the souls into Azeroth, turn it into the maw

[0:35:47] idenkaz_: they planned this a long time ago
[0:35:50] Average_Stali: sepulcher maybe contains the body of an extra first one, old gods inc again?
[0:35:53] Supers18: no
[0:35:57] Supers18: cus uther died before anduin
[0:35:58] megaleo420: he felt the jailer nearby or somethin
[0:35:58] Owlcopwn: arthus soul def in the sword / anduin
[0:35:59] Crowzcut: yes
[0:36:00] Atrial_: maybe he felt the power of the sword
[0:36:02] dutchie76: yea
[0:36:02] Supers18: anduin was very young
[0:36:02] Hitokiri83: reminded him on arthas
[0:36:03] idenkaz_: probably yea
[0:36:03] RavenARPG: Uther felt Arthas. 100%
[0:36:04] Lazugo: Yeah
[0:36:06] PrimogenitureJ: he felt the pain in his scar
[0:36:09] Supers18: thats what nobbel said anyway
[0:36:11] ArctosPrime: he felt the lich king power
[0:36:12] Thirn94: I think the keys Are what holds the jailer in the maw
[0:36:12] CDubTheRIPper: why is uther treated as a bad guy anywasy?
[0:36:12] dutchie76: even played that music
[0:36:17] PvtHudson093: its a harry potter situation
[0:36:18] yojimbra: I thought it was more "this is a king of stormwind."
[0:36:20] idenkaz_: has nothing to do with Arthas its the jailers power he felt
[0:36:20] ArctosPrime: the music changes
[0:36:20] Lazugo: https://pt.wowhead.com/news=295827/the-new-ilgynoth-whispers-in-visions-of-nzoth-analysis-speculation @Towelliee for analysis
[0:36:21] CDubTheRIPper: do i need to do the bastion story? LULL
[0:36:23] Alegnowar: ye uther felt arthas like in his cinematic
[0:36:26] PIXOID_: Anduin had a that new mourne sword the jailer made, felt it in his would cuz magic
[0:36:27] Owlcopwn: Yes
[0:36:31] CDubTheRIPper: possibly
[0:36:37] Crowzcut: yes i think so
[0:36:41] indestructible123: He probably felt the jailer (lich king/frostmourne) power
[0:36:43] ProClicker: Auduin surprised these people but how will he get the other keys?
[0:36:44] Domi98_: no, it is the jailer controlling anduin's soul through the ruins on his body armor
[0:36:45] DallTV_: could be ya
[0:36:51] Val3rion: I believe Arthas will get his story with helping anduin get free from the jailer
[0:36:53] Samaron2012: uther sensed something when anduin passed by so maybe?
[0:36:54] sumdude1974: AnduLich is kickass
[0:36:55] CDubTheRIPper: he could be anywhere tbh
[0:36:56] Average_Stali: either that or the sword is like Frostmourne and controlling anduin the same way as arthas
[0:37:07] FunkyThunderr: I don't think he felt Arthas he felt the presence of a mourneblade which gave him the scar
[0:37:07] Supers18: ctrl f boy king bro
[0:37:08] PrimogenitureJ: nah I don't think so. arthas is definitely in his personal torment chamber for failing him
[0:37:23] Crowargus: think he sensed the blade
[0:37:26] Lazugo: look at this one "Five lanterns, now darkened. The flame they seek will light the masters' way."
[0:37:27] RavenARPG: All goes around Uther/Arthas/Anduin. Not strictly related to the jailer. Mostly in order to free Anduin and possibly Arthas from control.
[0:37:34] PrimogenitureJ: It would be cool if it was Varian's soul though to really twist the knife
[0:37:38] Kyrrua: Wasn't Arthas's and the lich king true goal to create more undead to "protect azeroth" form future ennemies in the lore
[0:37:43] Kelticlore: I am hoping we find a way to repair the souls that have been scared by Frostmourne
[0:37:55] stratiss: 5 with the jailer
[0:37:55] idenkaz_: The arbiter
[0:37:57] Domi98_: jailer prob has a key himself
[0:38:00] Lazugo: nope 5
[0:38:00] Samaron2012: honestly with the upcoming raid i can see kelthuzad back stab the jailer and sylvanans with A. his own plans and B. if he knows arthas is down there and plan to get him out even if making a deal with us.
[0:38:01] Average_Stali: jailer could be the jailer
[0:38:04] Kelticlore: the Jai;er is the 5th
[0:38:05] Lazugo: 5 is the jailer
[0:38:05] Kyrrua: I don't see the winter queen dying
[0:38:09] Average_Stali: or his "key" is in the sepulcher
[0:38:11] DallTV_: he is the key ?
[0:38:14] sumdude1974: They have to tie it to Azeroth sooner or later
[0:38:18] dutchie76: winter queen dying LUL
[0:38:29] CDubTheRIPper: lmao
[0:38:31] idenkaz_: Arthas here Arthas there .. calm down KEKW
[0:38:34] Owlcopwn: they wouldn't believe him though, he's forsworn
[0:38:35] PvtHudson093: like they would trust him
[0:38:36] aid280: He didnt sense arthus he could see he wasnt right.
[0:38:36] Kelticlore: Uther was being taken some where
[0:38:37] PrimogenitureJ: uther gets bumped by a kyrian before he can say anything @towelliee

[0:38:44] Kyrrua: @dutchie76 ye I know its weird to say it when the whole expansion is in the death realm
[0:38:54] RavenARPG: He looks at Anduin like he was expecting to see Arthas. He looks surprised and confused because of that @towelliee
[0:38:57] dutchie76: yea
[0:39:01] Owlcopwn: @wingdox nah, he didn't, he never got that far
[0:39:01] aid280: However he did grab his scar...

[0:39:37] Average_Stali: i honestly think the arbiter locked the jailer's "key" in the sepulcer, this is why he needs the "keys" from the other zone bosses and to open the sepulcher
[0:39:44] Thepilli: mornign sir!
[0:39:49] Repsifu: never seen Towel off camera :D
[0:39:53] Val3rion: Arthas will get play a major roll in freeing Anduin from the Jailers grasp.

[0:40:11] wingdox: @Owlcopwn he did once he became forsworn when he comes back to the good side he says he doesnt know what happened in his life he just has this rage burning inside
[0:40:12] Average_Stali: soulbind like the conduits
[0:40:19] pokerigo: O_O
[0:40:19] Owlcopwn: Oh
[0:40:21] Samaron2012: @Towelliee yeah sorry i jumble words there. either he does have his own personaal plans on controlling the shadowlands or free arthas but he wants something like a "reward" from the arbiter for helping shadowlands.

[0:40:38] sumdude1974: There must always be a Lich King .....
[0:40:46] Kyrrua: He didn't looked like controlled when handing the weapon to the jailer, maybe its more of a double personality but the jailer can still see through his eyes or communicate
[0:40:49] dzwen: was it just me or did sylvannas start to regret her desicionmaking?
[0:41:09] Repsifu: Sylvanas will be a good bitch in the end
[0:41:18] PrimogenitureJ: Turalyon will totally be cool with a death empowered dude
[0:41:20] dutchie76: the jailer is like Sauron from lord of the rings LUL
[0:41:22] PrimogenitureJ: as king
[0:41:23] Clicklesly: Sepulcher is one of the Oribos NPCs lines
[0:41:24] Owlcopwn: He definitely had a moment of hesitation right after he killed the kyrian leader
[0:41:28] neorang3r: Sylvanas looks so confused in the trailer
[0:41:43] idenkaz_: she was never on his side to begin with. dont act like she suddenly changes her mind
[0:41:46] Average_Stali: the Primus of Maldraxxus warned to not let the jailer reach the sepulcher
[0:41:48] Domi98_: @Owlcopwn you can see he snapped out of the control and then the runes lit up again
[0:41:53] DallTV_: cold feet :P
[0:41:55] Owlcopwn: @Domi98_ exactly
[0:41:55] Supers18: Towelliee why no 9.2 tease
[0:41:59] RavenARPG: True.
[0:42:02] Alegnowar: still setting up a redemption arc after all she done
[0:42:06] dzwen: but we shouldn't forget that tyrande is somewhere out there sneakin' around
[0:42:09] Owlcopwn: @Supers18 9.2 tease would for sure spoil the endings of 9.1
[0:42:10] Owlcopwn: wdym
[0:42:26] sumdude1974: She wanted the helm for herself but destroyed it for him, now she sees Andy boy seemingly getting it
[0:42:40] moxing_hei: WOD 2.0
[0:42:43] neorang3r: @Towelliee what's ur impression on D2 remake?
[0:42:46] Samaron2012: knowing most stories involving hell for sure there will a redemption for her but its a "wanna be redeemed? okay. i sentence you into the maw to do this trial. succeed you are redeemed. if not then damned for eternity." deal.
[0:42:54] dutchie76: new expac dark and light in 2023
[0:42:54] Lawsson_Live: Covid probably making it super hard to get a timeline established
[0:43:02] dutchie76: LUL
[0:43:16] dutchie76: August def for BC classic
[0:43:28] NOS_4EVR: they spoiled us in Legion with the 77days content drops throughout.
[0:43:31] Average_Stali: gotta redeem sexy undead lady...or how will they make merch of her, she sells so many figures
[0:43:37] Crowargus: they did say they didnt have much ppl working on current cause of new stuff coming out think they might be funnelling people into new projects?
[0:43:42] Domi98_: yea this patch is gonna come super late, we didn't see any ingame footage at all
[0:43:43] dzwen: @neorang3r it's a remaster ;)
[0:43:45] Hitokiri83: resousrse from working at home are limited
[0:43:49] sumdude1974: spread to thin
[0:43:52] idenkaz_: u sure about that?
[0:43:52] PrimogenitureJ: how come people are so upset about that though...its just life right now man
[0:43:52] Samaron2012: they removed most of the dev team while back didnt they right?
[0:43:53] Deadly26: yeah they hid their covid impact well
[0:43:59] PsychoWarren: Sha mount
[0:44:00] Owlcopwn: tier better be in 9.1 or im gunna fall asleep
[0:44:04] dutchie76: i say July for 9.1 LUL
[0:44:16] Hitokiri83: the time to download or upload a work project takes time
[0:44:18] Lazugo: The ion's line made me laugh for real
[0:44:24] dutchie76: more renown more conduits
[0:44:28] dutchie76: more soulbinds
[0:44:34] dzwen: my guess is April / may for 9.1

[0:46:06] stjon13: solution= get rid of systems just give us content raids dungs
[0:46:21] jwalen: Hey towelliee just tuned in but can you get that mount still in that dungeon, been awhile since I played during valentines
[0:46:23] dutchie76: june july for 9.1 thats my prediction

[0:47:20] dutchie76: vanilla classic released august 26th in 2019
[0:47:22] Harskare: @towelliee will TBC compete for your attention with retail even through new retail content? i know many "streamer guilds" died when the streamer would go back and play retail for the new content
[0:47:32] Alegnowar: @Flyingmeat towel is having more of a discussion than an actual recap
[0:47:44] dutchie76: def 24th
[0:47:49] Kyrrua: @Towelliee bellular predicting sylvanas gets her redemption by getting herself killed to save Anduin, thoughts ?
[0:47:50] Flyingmeat: ah thanks @Alegnowar
[0:48:16] Deathu: I don't think 9.1 is comming till at least July @Towelliee

[0:48:31] ProClicker: Maybe Sylvanas becomes the Jailers jailer and stays in the Maw to make sure he doesn't escape
[0:48:36] choco_wow: you think tbc not until august?
[0:48:40] dutchie76: i think you will see at least 2 phases for BC before the year is out
[0:48:45] idenkaz_: @ProClicker this.
[0:48:50] Alegnowar: new jailer is gonna be sylvanas
[0:48:54] dzwen: yo you guys totally forget tyrande... whaddabout her?
[0:49:00] Harskare: are you a bigger fan of tbc than classic?
[0:49:03] dutchie76: yep
[0:49:05] DreavT2K: looking at the cinematic sylvanas seems to have a concience and is conflicted wih herself
[0:49:06] dutchie76: ZA LUL
[0:49:10] sumdude1974: But just when you get ready to raid in BC new retail comes out
[0:49:26] Kyrrua: sylvanas is in the new raid, so she might die there. I hope she escapes or is just gaining time for smthing
[0:49:31] othraerir: mag/gruul is 25 though
[0:49:32] ReplayValueTV: The Arena seasons are worse IMO
[0:49:34] stjon13: that's the best rollout for BC IMO
[0:49:45] Cloudemon: this is the love rocket. i was here man
[0:49:46] Bixster: Maybe phase 1 is pretty short ike 2 month.
[0:49:48] Expressy: TBC is going to ruin my study as an engineer LUL
[0:49:58] Clicklesly: Kara was the best raid anyway ^^
[0:50:01] shamscam: people 100% would have the first one done
[0:50:04] stjon13: exactly
[0:50:08] dutchie76: Kara was my favorite
[0:50:10] porowozek: I'm probably gonna finish leveling around phase 4...or not KEKW
[0:50:13] spazik: People will smash TBC raid in hours anyway :D Like they did Naxx
[0:50:14] TheEnstraynomic: how much of a roadblack would vashj be if blizzard released her with the persuasion MC abilitiy?
[0:50:15] dutchie76: the BC version
[0:50:17] Lazugo: Liking or dont the bellular dude is getting a lot of the story right
[0:50:27] Lantern214: Remember, they released content too fast in TBC. BT was a perfect example
[0:50:36] Kyrrua: honestly, everyone has time to play bc. Everyone forgets this game let's you progress at ur pace
[0:50:48] Kyrrua: there's no rush unlike retail
[0:50:52] dutchie76: yep
[0:50:52] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[0:50:54] dutchie76: it did
[0:50:54] ItsXolten: Is there a price for the character boost?
[0:51:15] Supers18: Towelliee were u surprised by 9.1 raid being maw? everyone thought it would me mald or ardenweald next
[0:51:15] Lawsson_Live: good time to be a wow fan though real talk
[0:51:25] PvtHudson093: I like the Seal changes for Paladins
[0:51:28] dutchie76: Wrath will be next in line
[0:51:30] Expressy: @kyrrua that's what I loved about tbc 😊
[0:51:38] sunmx: Copy/Paste
[0:51:51] Clicklesly: They'll just have dedicated Vanilla servers ^^
[0:51:51] Expressy: @kyrrua no rush
[0:51:53] Hitokiri83: probably the same concept as ptr character copy
[0:51:59] dutchie76: Phase 2 will probably be december
[0:52:00] Bixster: isnt there a TBC and a classic only sever for every classic server?
[0:52:01] SeaIOfApprovaI: Did you say seal @PvtHudson093
[0:52:02] Kyrrua: starting bc at launch or 6 or 1 year later you'll still have to grind through the same content
[0:52:03] banishtyrion: it's probably different servers
[0:52:03] Tehcooky: No it means literally character copy to a new real@
[0:52:05] Sandisy: assume they'll open new realms that will stay classic classic forever
[0:52:06] dutchie76: or november
[0:52:07] Tehcooky: Realm*
[0:52:08] Harskare: nah its just a stasis server for classic chars that dont want to go to tbc
[0:52:14] akia03: so 9.1 is just a raid a big dungeon and some maw stuff?
[0:52:17] Tehcooky: It’s pretty easy to understand
[0:52:20] stjon13: ya b/c back then there was no turn off your xp
[0:52:23] morningporr1dge: shitty blizzcon
[0:52:24] dutchie76: phase 3 4 5 all 2022 imo
[0:52:46] sortehenning: !tbc
[0:52:46] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc
[0:52:57] PvtHudson093: @SeaIOfApprovaI Yeah both get Seal of Blood/Vengence in tbc classic
[0:53:13] dutchie76: how many phases you think this year Rob?
[0:53:20] SeaIOfApprovaI: @SeaIOfApprovaI That gets my approval
[0:53:23] Kyrrua: #carefulchanges
[0:53:24] Dark_lite7: all changes they mentioned seemed good for tbc.
[0:53:25] memnon94: I mean someone actually cares about alliance paladins ? Kappa
[0:53:40] bakkich: its the right call
[0:53:48] TheEnstraynomic: i guess blizzard had to learn the hard way that #nochanges pretty much doomed WC3 reforged
[0:53:50] draqqis: The arena gearing is gonna be weird. PVE gear is going to be some of the best gear in arena for almost all seasons
[0:53:56] Kyrrua: pretty sure even "nochanges guys would want a gold cap LUL
[0:53:59] dutchie76: Muru LUL
[0:53:59] ryanc1124: 4AM and I am hammered
[0:54:05] dutchie76: yes
[0:54:14] Collected1: didnt Kungen solo that
[0:54:15] Clicklesly: Post-fix, pre-nerf ^^
[0:54:17] Supers18: I think all the raids will still fall over super fast
[0:54:17] aid280: Thats good
[0:54:23] aid280: They rolled over classic
[0:54:30] Ezekyler: i member Gruul fight killed my fps on that fight KEKW
[0:54:34] ryanc1124: hammered for the hammer squad towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:54:36] TheEnstraynomic: i wonder if they mean pre-nerf kael'thas as in the version where healers would get aggro, and he would wipe people because he's taunt immune
[0:54:40] dutchie76: Gruul was easy
[0:54:44] Collected1: i dont think they can tune back history
[0:54:51] Collected1: we're all just much better players now
[0:54:55] dutchie76: the orges were a pain though

[0:55:14] Bixster: we will see how hard the unnerfed really are after all these years
[0:55:41] Dark_lite7: I really hope they keep attunements the same
[0:55:47] dutchie76: archimonde LUL
[0:55:53] AlphaRocket: so what was in blizzcon
[0:55:57] Manabucho: they also didnt mention tier sets right?
[0:55:59] AlphaRocket: anyone can give a rundown
[0:55:59] Kyrrua: time to look back at that BC attunement chart and have an orgasm
[0:56:01] TheEnstraynomic: hmm, depending on that, i also wonder how they would reward the champion of the naaru and hand of a'dal titles
[0:56:03] draqqis: I would be surprised if they did end of expansion attunements
[0:56:07] Bixster: did they say if everything will be on 2.4 balance just like classic was on the last patch?
[0:56:16] dutchie76: Kara attunement LUL
[0:56:44] ProClicker: Imagine people who don't how many accounts they will have for the boost
[0:56:45] idenkaz_: so you really dont think players will streamroll the content like in classic? because tuning. lets see
[0:56:48] Blastaho: no pictures
[0:56:50] dutchie76: shadowlabs pre-nerf LUL
[0:56:55] Blastaho: i mean video
[0:57:02] Kyrrua: "BC attunement chart" google guys SuperVinlin
[0:57:19] Bixster: maybe they will also go through multiple patch cycles and balance cycles, because they have more data. instead of just using the last patch.
[0:57:23] dutchie76: that Gruul Trinket

[0:58:08] dutchie76: cant wait for Stunherald LUL
[0:58:22] sheepexpert: on endless tbc peop!e cleared first week evry content

[0:58:52] eziz86: Did they say release data tbc ?
[0:58:59] Kyrrua: im mad because warrior and mage which are my main will get shadowed on the meter by other classes in bc BibleThump

[0:59:32] memnon94: we would have the new expansion with Gamon as the warchief
[0:59:32] sunmx: u EU?
[0:59:34] idenkaz_: but the numbers bro. the numbers. they need to put out some content or we go back to WoD numbers ...
[0:59:35] Bixster: but how long do you want to delay. there will hopeful be a real blizzcon at the end of the year
[0:59:36] Supers18: yea what server u on towelliee
[0:59:37] Dark_lite7: we usually get flight throughs of the new raid/areas but we didn't even get that.
[0:59:41] Kelticlore: I can log onto one of my Alliance Tanks
[0:59:43] SeaIOfApprovaI: Im Alliance NA healer
[0:59:49] zwapy: corehound best pet or is it kinda random?
[0:59:55] Collected1: the 9.1 white knights are out in force. criticise any of it and you're told to go play another game on reddit.
[0:59:56] gayfuI: no ones calling u crazy shadowlands is lame and retail is finished come tbc
[0:59:57] gamor12: not dead
[1:00:00] Klauzzer: she got rekt
[1:00:00] Kyrrua: is she dead if she's technically already dead ?
[1:00:00] memnon94: I dont think she dies that easily

[1:00:07] idenkaz_: she cant die
[1:00:09] jabbz85: im oce but can get you a tank q
[1:00:10] Bolt_tv: they have to be alive otherwise the zones would cease to exsist
[1:00:11] Domi98_: they legit said nothing about 9.1, you get new raid new dungeon but everyone kinda knows that if u have been playing wow for more than 1 exp
[1:00:22] porowozek: she's fiiiiine just put shiny back in

[1:00:37] idenkaz_: yeah he had a good take on it
[1:00:47] Supers18: yeah
[1:00:56] dutchie76: very true

[1:01:07] ZetherTV: TBC > new wow
[1:01:07] Frank4LuLz: blizzcon.com II coming
[1:01:11] Celestia6: they are way behind
[1:01:12] gayfuI: RETAIL IS A FINISHED GAME
[1:01:12] Collected1: true but it's much easier for them to showcase that sort of content at an in person event than it is remotely
[1:01:18] CDubTheRIPper: Boralus monkaS
[1:01:20] othraerir: so, when do you think it'll be out?
[1:01:25] Collected1: they went with pre-recorded which hinders a lot of what they can do
[1:01:25] 3dRes: It was basically an unfinished presentation
[1:01:26] dutchie76: thats why i said July LUL
[1:01:41] Kelticlore: I am logging on my Alliance Tank if you need a Tank
[1:01:44] Lazugo: We just need to watch the line from the dev about the soulbinds

[1:53:13] EtherealFidelity: do you think we can transfer servers at TBC launch?
[1:53:29] mbright85: it just got worse and worse .. lol
[1:53:37] telatic: So Towelliee will my level 55 from classic be able to go into the OL or will it be only fresh level 1 from TBC that can access the content?
[1:53:38] Kelticlore: I got a Horde Blood DK
[1:53:40] MaX_DutchyW: toughts on the new riad?
[1:53:45] Nyvill: druid lvling is really nice, no downtime

[1:54:27] MrGrimms: @Towelliee tayswizle - bleeding hollow healer q
[1:54:29] dragothicx: I hope the TBC Classic prepatch lasts for quite a while considering how long it takes to level up
[1:54:38] Sarocus: imagine the crowds of BE paladins leveling. Will be glorious
[1:54:39] MaX_DutchyW: DK yeah bud you needed max level
[1:54:41] Kyrrua: #somechanges proving good I guess
[1:55:11] dragothicx: Blood Elves everywhere, not just Paladins LUL
[1:55:13] Protectionplan: Are you still on Pagel for classic ?
[1:55:26] Nyvill: the only bad thing about boost is that people gonna abuse it for profession cds
[1:55:30] itsdibbles: the boost will help me get a friend in to experience tbc fosho
[1:55:34] Bammtea: what im adopted? monkaS thats a big change
[1:55:38] Protectionplan: ooh okay
[1:55:40] TrowGundam: God I'd kill to pay a for a 58 boost for a BE. Vanilla leveling is ass
[1:55:43] Nottinghams: Paying for character copy seems pretty scummy
[1:55:50] othraerir: cuz it takes aaaaaages
[1:55:57] sprert: i mean did blizzard ever say that you have to pay for that one time boost? obvisiouly they will but ...
[1:55:59] Shrenko: so are they not releasing any fresh servers for TBC ?
[1:56:01] MarleyVibes: They said the boost was one per account so it’s not that bad
[1:56:15] othraerir: although, didn't tbc nerf exp needed to level 1-60?
[1:56:22] telatic: @towelliee do you think raids will be easily cleared in TBC or will they make some challenge to it.
[1:56:26] neonwarrior21: one per account
[1:56:30] Protectionplan: They said Paid just not how much it would cost
[1:56:30] Bammtea: bobby needs a new car
[1:56:37] ThePawPaw: FREE KEKW
[1:56:42] Alegnowar: it's gonna be tied to that datamined promotional mount for retail
[1:56:43] Kelticlore: im on my Horde Tank if you need it
[1:56:55] Jugelum: I think the boost for 1 character was good, even if it is paid
[1:56:55] Sarocus: multi million company for a reason!
[1:57:00] MadBomberXX: theey said 1 time boost per acc that was it
[1:57:08] dragothicx: I think they teased that the boost might be free but Character copy service is Premium?
[1:57:08] sprert: it could be attached to a 6 oder 12 month sub like diablo3
[1:57:13] Deathchampt: ye just regase old crap
[1:57:22] Bammtea: yes but they need the new tesla with the console in it

[2:34:55] Shrenko: @ChikiiW no, they said ground mounts, not flying
[2:34:58] PrisheBurningBlade: make it so the optimal way to level isn't doing story questline, and using threads of fate to skip the scenario. boom good system
[2:35:11] Collected1: too many god damn systems and currencies
[2:35:11] Dinermoe: @ChikiiW

[2:41:47] porowozek: let's play rock'nroll racing! =)
[2:41:47] Collected1: Shrenko : yeah my idea is Paragon Levels are the standard moving forward. So every expansion you get dropped to 50 and 0 paragon and you work them up again. keep it simple. everything you do at max level earns you paragon xp.
[2:41:59] 0sacon: what did you think of blizzcon?
[2:42:05] icemanj99: yeah, been waiting for you to break out that ps3 for some classics man

[2:42:54] ghostofnappa_doom: yes draenor is next, and than people are assuming Legion would be next. but since it wasn't announced during blizzcon online, looking less likely
[2:42:54] othraerir: i need the tbc one, and the SKIPPED it cuz sl launched
[2:42:58] Kelticlore: im saving up timewalking badges for when Legion Timewlaking is added
[2:43:00] othraerir: they

[3:10:00] TemplarBean: @towelliee jailer corrupts her?
[3:10:04] Lexi__Marie: so the one thing i didnt see clearly... did anduin have a hole in his chest
[3:10:31] CDubTheRIPper: i wonder what anduin will do to Stormwind
[3:10:49] itsdibbles: Jailer already has maldraxxus
[3:10:54] itsdibbles: primus was the first
[3:10:58] Byytet: ohhh what if they get into tryande and control her for ardenweald? I mean they are looking for her
[3:10:59] Pushma: i hope they dont kill auduin
[3:11:01] Collected1: random thought, did we actually see Sylvanas corrupt Anduin? Is it possible they're already working together?
[3:11:15] dracullus: I wonder what Jailer means when he said he need 3 more keys, he should have already access to Primus, SIre and now Archon
[3:11:17] TemplarBean: He said the Vessel served its purpose though; so maybe he has no more plans for andy

[3:11:51] xMania_DKx: I really like how Anduin has grown and changed, I hope he makes it out of this.
[3:11:52] dracullus: @Towelliee Sylvanas and Anduin have best covenant and soulbind
[3:11:57] Kelticlore: 9.1 raid we free Anduin
[3:12:03] Ardailec: Maybe Denathrius' key was split into the medallions or something silly.
[3:12:05] swampt1l: Anduin zzzz
[3:12:30] Chokomilkgtl: they are all gonna be kept safe in oribos, and that will just keep all the keys together and that'll be the last raid for sure
[3:12:33] Lexi__Marie: another dumb question, (horde main) was uther alive when anduin was born
[3:12:39] TemplarBean: Sylvanas is deffo saving him
[3:12:47] LiaisonG: Yeah I think its almost certain that Jailyboi did some runey thing to grab control of his soul
[3:12:57] Byytet: The jailer said through Anduin that the archon was supposed to be bind with her brother so is Jailer the brother of the archon?
[3:13:17] dracullus: WoW is just 4 years after W3
[3:13:20] Frank4LuLz: wheres Lothar
[3:13:24] Ezekyler: yes he was born, but was a little kid
[3:13:34] LiaisonG: @Byytet Yeah theyve refered to each other as brothers and sisters
[3:13:38] swampt1l: im curious who the "first ones" are
[3:13:39] shelbersg: we still think Anduin is Arthus love child
[3:13:42] LiaisonG: including the jailer
[3:13:44] Sincline387: I think the jailer is the step brother......
[3:13:51] TemplarBean: The Pantheon of death; yeah I think they all refer to eachother as siblings
[3:13:52] LiaisonG: He's adopted
[3:13:55] Pushma: have you slept yet?
[3:14:19] dracullus: so Jailer is stuck in washing machine?
[3:14:22] Byytet: Are they going to corrupt tyrande aswell like Anduin just to get into ardenweald?
[3:14:26] iMaccaPro: anyone else see that there is a brief look of concern in sylvanas' eyes when she looks at anduin towards the end of the cinematic?
[3:14:31] officialviz: @dracullus Gotta get him out
[3:14:36] Ezekyler: @Towelliee what i'm interested is who was the Jailer before they locked him in the Maw and what realm of death he was in charge, that will be probably the last zone like Argus
[3:14:37] Tubbsyy: WandaVision has been really good so far
[3:14:40] Lexi__Marie: you said your meds keep you awake instead of making you drowzy?
[3:14:53] TemplarBean: @imaccapro ye shes deffo having a redemption arc, 1000000%
[3:14:59] Tubbsyy: Disney+ is killing it with the new shows imo
[3:15:06] dracullus: well could be KJ style "redemption"

[3:17:28] dracullus: haven't conduits datamined item levels up to season 4?
[3:17:33] TemplarBean: I want WoW, NO SYSTEMS
[3:17:34] swampt1l: they complain about either having too much systems or not having none at all
[3:17:36] Byytet: didnt they have like ranks in abilites in legion
[3:18:01] TemplarBean: Just balance the classes, scrap the systems
[3:18:11] Lexi__Marie: current max level conduits are what 213?

[3:18:58] swampt1l: you probably play Classic KEKW @silentknight190
[3:18:59] Lofire303: I'm hyped for what's to come. Things seem smooth and the story is not going the direction i was expecting. . . . They did a great job with the story the have released so far.
[3:19:01] Frank4LuLz: can we give some power to Texas they need it
[3:19:05] Byytet: They did say in a chinese QA that tier sets will be back but not in 9.1
[3:19:05] dartrilas: every single one of you would get bored if they didnt have any systems at all
[3:19:11] Detonite: no poisons :)
[3:19:16] FranticAlba: Without borrowed power you either never get anything new or you just end up with 200 redundant abilities as the expansions go on

[3:20:02] FranticAlba: @silentknight190 So you got ksm?
[3:20:08] FranticAlba: @silentknight190 CE?
[3:20:25] TemplarBean: If I was blizz Id just focus on classes and mainly Torghast this xpac; they have the chance to have a longstanding form of content there if they keep working to get it right
[3:20:33] silentknight190: there's no hard content in retail wow
[3:20:37] Lexi__Marie: omg i cant believe the thing that no one could possibly have seen coming actually happened

[3:21:28] officialviz: It's becoming like Azerite power, instead of 4 rings, it'll be 4 different trees.
[3:21:48] TemplarBean: @swapt1_ no-one cares because its not fun; it was the most hyped thing pre expac and got the best feedback of everything in Alpha before they changed it
[3:21:52] dragothicx: About Shadowlands having more systems than BfA, wasn't Shadowlands already called "Systemlands" by the community so LUL

[3:26:16] firefly_on: @BladeScream wrath alpha
[3:26:17] Shrenko: @BladeScream its just classic
