[3:25:11] swordart_19: @mrrazputin nothing
[3:25:17] rhodistar: Is it likely that they will give us a Renown 80 token for 9.2? Like the 40 Renown token we have right now.

[3:26:46] Cyouskin: its very definitively a RWF issue.
[3:26:48] swordart_19: @mrrazputin cause they are whiny clowns and baby rage for self Inflicted gameplay
[3:27:04] mrrazputin: @swordart_19 xD

[3:28:20] Rygothx: @chukudu Good one!
[3:28:28] Cyouskin: Though, tbf, if the item level restriction was removed, that would have a greater impact on the general playerbase and RWF.
[3:28:37] Scoodles91: well the game shouldnt be balanced around them, so if the want to degen it that much, they can do it
[3:29:14] Cyouskin: We also farmed LFR in Cata for the insane tier sets. if you remember that
[3:29:32] swordart_19: I laugh at them PepeLaugh
[3:29:43] dettod2k: echo gets salary

[3:33:57] swordart_19: @crusadernero what you win you moron then
[3:34:03] mmo_kenna_: that's what's unique about RWF, you can prep for an advantage
[3:34:12] swordart_19: @crusadernero cg tweet from devs?
[3:34:38] mmo_kenna_: other eSports like halo, league you all start the round the same
[3:34:43] CrusaderNero: @swordart_19 I wont bother with someone using slurs as an argument. have a good day :)
[3:35:10] swordart_19: @crusadernero well you can't asnwer weirdo bye murloc
[3:35:13] Cyouskin: i dont think its P2W yet.  Salaries exist.  But is it any different if someone takes vacation time?

[3:35:17] mmo_kenna_: I get what your saying, what about tournament servers then?
[3:35:22] dalaraz: i have a feeling that might change in 10.0
[3:35:24] swordart_19: Game doesn't revolve around few degens.
[3:35:25] mmo_kenna_: premade chars
[3:35:39] Ablackdruid: I don't know if you brought this up already but I think having all or at least a majority of the raiders all in the same room is also a big advantage.
[3:35:46] CrusaderNero: imagine if a non sub talked like that in this chat LUL
[3:35:50] Cyouskin: Tournament Realm is also anti-moo
[3:36:16] 3dRes: @crusadernero what's wrong?
[3:36:39] SimonHalfSoul: !Lost

[3:36:50] dalaraz: @CrusaderNero you are kinda weird tbh
[3:37:05] vonblue: bliz could normalise ilevel when u enter a raid so wouldent make a diffrence on the gear farming side
[3:37:21] JerBoody: Tournament realm wouldn’t work either though because how do they handle boss drops rng during progression?
[3:37:26] swordart_19: It is not esport event.
[3:37:46] YungshrimpXD: Echo won the last RWF with the perfect pull. with perfect math, when NA had more gear and still couldn't kill sly
[3:37:49] Venkxx: it kind of is, not in the general sense, but there are a lot of players, lets say from old paragon or something, who would obliterate some guilds out there, but they stopped playing, probably because its too much stress if it isnt your job
[3:37:56] porowozek: my one and only personal problem with global release is that it would be NA time release so during EU prime time there's nothing going on because raiders are sleeping =)
[3:38:03] YungshrimpXD: skill over gear any day of the week
[3:38:09] Orgabism: Wow is an mmorpg, should be different
[3:38:14] billybaroo1: did u uninstall new world?
[3:38:15] dalaraz: scripe mentioned he hates heroic splits etc
[3:38:22] swordart_19: @venkxx Same as music festival /concerts are not Music competition
[3:38:28] Cyouskin: no one lieks splits
[3:38:33] Orgabism: My opinion is that even MDI should happen on live servers.

[3:38:50] swordart_19: @orgabism that would be Pog
[3:38:52] dalaraz: he recommended heroic releasing same week as mythic as a solution to avoid it
[3:39:31] swordart_19: They do not have to they choose to. No one is holding them at gun point. p
[3:39:39] doomester: @Towelliee easy solution, no tier sets like the pervious patches and expac
[3:40:14] swordart_19: @cyouskin there is nothing wrong in first place.
[3:40:21] mmo_kenna_: I'm sorry but if you want to be the best in the world you gotta go the extra mile
[3:40:25] swordart_19: They are 3rd party
[3:40:52] dalaraz: @doomester its not that simple,if its not tier its sockets,if notsockets is corruption,or shard of domination gear,always something there
[3:40:53] Katrikan: they are paid to win Kappa
[3:41:12] swordart_19: Like sports EZ
[3:41:26] Ma_thu: Was watching a video about Destiny 1/2 raid world firsts. And the best thing he said was, don't come into it thinking you're going to have any kind of fun. If you can do that you're ready.
[3:41:29] swordart_19: @cyouskin what a bullshit take
[3:41:31] mmo_kenna_: football if you have the money to buy the best players you win
[3:41:31] ande7531: but when you view time and money as interchangeable which is valid, everything is pay to win
[3:41:39] MeisterPetze: who the fuck cares about asmonbold
[3:41:47] swordart_19: WH OMEGALUL
[3:41:53] GameVelocity: Asmon did talk about it in one of his videos
[3:41:54] Bruizedfish: @SpartanD84 thats rough
[3:41:56] damnsquirrels78: @Towelliee i have  hunter is it common to change specialities to do different things .. quest. pvp. dungeons etc?
[3:42:07] billybaroo1: wat game isn't ptw in 2022
[3:42:23] swordart_19: @damnsquirrels78 try and see can change any time
[3:42:51] ande7531: but the point was not if they win or not  no ? its if they can get an advantage i.e increased chance of winning from spending money
[3:43:10] jimmwayne: you forgt one biss
[3:43:13] dalaraz: @swordart_19 what if it is a general issue though,doesnt it need solution ?
[3:43:13] jimmwayne: boss
[3:43:24] Ferrolune: I'd rather see a currency that lets you buy gear from the raid for every boss you kill that doesn't give drops. Including reclears same week.
[3:43:25] symerestinks: Yo towelliee haven’t been keeping up, is there a current mmo that u can somewhat compare lost ark to? Just to get an idea of the game
[3:43:33] swordart_19: @cyouskin You are outright dumb
[3:43:44] Synonymous: make survival top spec after they farmed the bow LUL
[3:43:49] damnsquirrels78: cause in the beginning of wow and whe i started before taking a few year break beast master used t o rock
[3:43:54] swordart_19: @dalaraz few degens BabyRage about self inflicted gameplay is not any issue.
[3:44:16] swordart_19: @cyouskin Your argument is on level I have issue why people don't have wings.
[3:44:23] dalaraz: @swordart_19 yeah i guess,maybe

[3:45:06] PierogiesAndKielbasa: Does Lost Ark have good character creation and customization?
[3:45:10] symerestinks: Damn didn’t know it was click to move, sounds interesting
[3:45:13] swordart_19: @mmo_kenna_ there is testing for them as far I know

[3:45:24] errohr: Born in Cuba or Cuban parents? Wtf I didn’t know this for years
[3:45:28] dalaraz: @mmo_kenna_ since progress is hugely account wide than char specific,dont be afraid to try stuff
[3:45:31] rensdeamo: It hits 100% when you get the mount
[3:45:32] Ma_thu: @mmo_kenna_ the $99 bundle paladin skin is probably the most bad ass thing I've seen in a game in years. That's what I'm playing XD
[3:45:43] Ferrolune: had 584 kills before I got ulduar mount  :|
[3:45:49] ande7531: it kan never hit 100%
[3:45:52] ande7531: can*
[3:45:52] BattleKnoedel: its not gonna reach 100%
[3:45:54] mmo_kenna_: I'm tempted by the 100 bucks one haha
[3:46:05] jimmwayne: he got nalak ?
[3:46:12] swordart_19: @battleknoedel COPIUM
[3:46:15] ande7531: i guess it depends on the rounding used
[3:46:24] Bruizedfish: LUL

[3:50:41] symerestinks: Did they make old content semi difficult again in wow?
[3:50:51] Ferrolune: in b4 they stealth nerfed the drop and made it only drop in mythic but forgot to remove the drop tables from other difficulties
[3:50:52] jenaris90: 433 tris wft dude!

[4:10:08] GK_DSYNC: Lost Ark is like Metin2?

[4:10:21] Harskare: @towelliee have you chosen a class on lost ark yet?
[4:10:24] dalaraz: its super grindy,specialy if you wanna minmax
[4:10:25] swordart_19: @alexkayzz lineage 2 on phone?
[4:10:44] swordart_19: @pr1m0x21 well I think it will be similar themed in asian
[4:10:50] LastShadowRider: @Towelliee  Lost ark  the  gameplay is like  Diablo 3  same  angle  few skills  but has more   things  to get stronger
[4:10:51] Alexkayzz: @swordart_19  Naaa besides WoW and FF I played no others MMOs LUL
[4:11:09] Rudric_Ice: i hope its not GIGA GRINDY

[4:12:07] RubbleyJ: will you play any dying light 2?
[4:12:09] Pr1m0x21: Very
[4:12:18] dalaraz: good part of lostark is that,it locks you out of content cause you cant spam it,so you either move on,or level an alt to funnel your main
[4:12:20] khemikale: i played destroyer on RU servers, sucks it wont release on launch
[4:12:22] billybaroo1: who u got tomorrow? bengals or kc?
[4:12:32] geokouts: write : We are doing for the Memes :P
[4:12:33] dalaraz: 1 would say alts are mandatory for lost ark
[4:12:45] dalaraz: since chars progress is time gated,and you go th rough taht with alts
[4:12:53] ImDero3: is lost ark p2w?
[4:12:53] Zireaell7: If im not mistaken, you can play whatever class you want until tier 3, leveling up your account is what matters in the first two tiers
[4:13:00] swordart_19: @dalaraz sounds weird
[4:13:04] spiked16: perfect them :)
[4:13:19] KPable: ally side?

[4:13:30] Samaellus: Wildstar?

[4:13:41] RubbleyJ: i miss wildstar
[4:13:53] dalaraz: @swordart_19 and in lost ark,as an example,you can do 3 daily raids per char for mats
[4:14:00] swordart_19: @dalaraz that makes sense thought something degen xD
[4:14:08] Shrenko: did you really play it though @Rubbley ?
[4:14:18] SpoonManes: i was more of a altoholic when i was in my teens and 20s. two or three chars now at most

[5:19:31] MrGattz: @JayBelzz last time i did a totems build was like delve league with FP totems. never thought of trying it with EA but that kind sounds fun. maybe it will be a totems league for starters and ill try it lol
[5:20:33] JayBelzz: @MrGattz You should! EA totems is so fun to play, especially as hiero (mana regen and placement speed is insane) . Its ignite based tho, which makes is even more op

[5:23:43] Trasheye: LULE
[5:23:56] Frank4LuLz: towelliee the authority of mmo's
[5:24:18] NevermoreOGTV: ashes of creation will more than likely be the titan of mmos when it releases lol
[5:24:38] Xanigh: If it was the fish, wouldn't you have the mistress mount, since she's so fishy
[5:24:47] Trasheye: @SalvationOG Copium OMEGALUL
[5:24:48] Curmyx: im already at 186 attempts on famu :(

[5:25:15] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Ashes of COPIUM
[5:25:28] jwithtoomanyhobbies: i mean i hope its good whenever it does come out. but im not gonna sweat it till its in my hands and i can play it
[5:25:29] belfastcl: we saw the alpha, it wasn't great
[5:25:45] NevermoreOGTV: unless WoW can make the comeback it needs tbh
[5:26:05] FranciscoTheMage: Star Citizen Ashes

[5:26:41] aNxje: am I the only one who thinks lost ark looks dog water? wish I could get the hype for it so I can take a break from wow lol
[5:26:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Pantheon will be the best mmo to come out @Towelliee
[5:26:42] pixxelina: the mounts looked bad imo as well
[5:26:51] Trasheye: AoC = Age of Conan
[5:27:40] NevermoreOGTV: AoC is looking very promising though the races look good, mounts on point, and attack/magic animations look insane
[5:27:40] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[5:27:51] luckfore: i hope aoc will be good but i think its a big fat flop
[5:27:56] Skorb: Same with League mmo
[5:28:17] Diofael: Haven't heard anything about Pantheon for ages
[5:28:57] luckfore: that was during MoP LUL
[5:29:08] belfastcl: didn't the main pantheon dev die?
[5:29:20] Trasheye: @belfastcl rip
[5:29:29] Thunderbrew: Pantheon might be dead if that's the case
[5:29:30] Rottencoarse: that is an OOF
[5:29:31] NevermoreOGTV: all really good mmos need time before releasing can't really compare it with star citizen. star citizen will never be full released lmao
[5:29:51] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they got seven figure investment jan 2021 @Towelliee
[5:30:03] NevermoreOGTV: I've heard of pantheon once lol 😆
[5:30:16] Diofael: True

[5:33:16] ashwing_: I wonder if Cohh will still preach for them if they do that LUL
[5:33:17] Shaele: Cohh supported the Pantheon devs with some very heavy doe. Like 6 figures as he said before.
