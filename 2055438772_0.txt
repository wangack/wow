[2:17:50] JtPacks: im a rogue main now
[2:17:50] the_audacity_x: am i wrong thinking you want to roll before AR so you get the three buffs instead of 2 on the next roll?
[2:17:52] Farfetchdxx: ambush, between the eyes, ambush, between the eyes, ambush, between the eyes, ambush, between the eyes, ambush, between the eyes,
[2:17:54] ashdor: @Pikabooirl where was that in the cup?
[2:18:03] itschen: hmmm you not doing this dps in awc………trolling?
[2:18:04] two32am: didnt get that when do you between the eyes?
[2:18:05] eZ_BFT: so am i using dispatch too much?
[2:18:09] muppetx: its not a bug, you cant vanish/dance during subterfuge i think
[2:18:10] magestically2: what if he has one eye?
[2:18:10] sean_spelled_like_seen: What's that bug anyways? I've been messing around with outlaw as an alt and the BTE keeps buggin out
[2:18:12] Hewozuoai: feenNotes got it boss
[2:18:13] Boomer_Brian: meld is night elf racial?
[2:18:15] otherbarry1: Did between the eyes not do any dam in awc?
[2:18:19] Schwantes2: This guy really does have a phd in wow
[2:18:21] XyranthiaRose: Also keep blade flurry up as it pauses your SnD timer
[2:18:22] Schwantes2: Dr Pikaboo
[2:18:24] sean_spelled_like_seen: just won't let me hit between the eyes on people half the game
[2:18:41] hemm__: lol all those combo points
[2:18:42] allenlondon210: @Schwantes2 yep
[2:18:43] hemm__: insane
[2:18:47] xxxrated: and thats how we become 1/3 a Wizkx. i kid i kid
[2:18:55] dirtbagjimmy1021: haha 2 button class!like classic
[2:18:56] hcrzealot: @Pikabooirl Thank you for demonstrating the rotation for us
[2:18:56] meuteurlol: The Details for the AWC stream seemed to show the dps spikes instead of just the overall dps
[2:18:58] Schwantes2: Do you between the eyes at 5+?
[2:19:14] e10100111001: wait shouldnt we be asking trill for the dmg rotation
[2:19:20] pmanfit91: Wow. Look at the damage when you're not getting double disarmed, cycloned, stunned on CD, etc.
[2:19:28] yellow_caprisun_straw: i guess everytime in awc didnt have eyes
[2:19:33] yellow_caprisun_straw: team
[2:19:44] Hewozuoai: !talents
[2:19:44] Nightbot: SUB BUQAcWb37Z8KXj8LlE1rTPXfsBAkQAAAAAAItkkUSEkikEiQcAJJJJSLlEJlWISSiAKRAAAAIBC

[2:19:48] Eradivyn: how many times do you dispatch?
[2:19:49] the_audacity_x: are you running 2set or 4 set?
[2:19:49] Milnzee: i dont even play rogue and it made sense to me
[2:19:51] meuteurlol: You could see when the hoolibang monk was going ham
[2:20:06] dirtbagjimmy1021: lol trash!!
[2:20:06] Hewozuoai: !armory
[2:20:07] Nightbot: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/tichondrius/Tmpikaboo
[2:20:18] sean_spelled_like_seen: @Pikabooirl is there any way to reset the bug or do you just have to wait for the thing to wear off?
[2:20:20] ashdor: @Pikabooirl is that what happened in the cup trill just got lucky with way more resets
[2:20:24] eZ_BFT: so you have 6 seconds out of the 1st stealth, then 6 more in dance, then 6 more with vanish, so what do you press while waiting for dance?
[2:20:48] sgtstarfox: 5 head shit right there boys
[2:20:48] mac_zo: this man just gave us the full guide
[2:20:54] SwiisH_Tv: you can also AR while in stealth window to get free max bte
[2:21:03] isbre: what do u have  ghostly macrod with ? @Pikabooirl
[2:21:05] XyranthiaRose: You can also time AR for when you also will have vanish and dance soon since AR will be paused during dance and subter.
[2:21:13] atorob: yeah i would screw that up royally lol, im not cut out to be a pirate
[2:21:27] Thegina: you can make a BTE macro based on rogue stances
[2:21:27] Schwantes2: How many points do you wait for till you between the eyes
[2:21:31] eZ_BFT: on the dummy now
[2:21:38] eZ_BFT: we can finish the vod after
[2:21:40] eZ_BFT: 3s
[2:21:44] Grimm303: alwyas ambush during sub never pistol
[2:21:52] domoyega: is that your elbow?
[2:21:57] Fourofdiamonds1: can you play this while in a pirate mog?
[2:21:57] muppetx: @Thegina what is it?
[2:21:59] tatattv: can I just macro all this in one button?
[2:22:08] Deyconn: did you try pushing purge
[2:22:08] Sizzurp11: why did you turn your character away like that?
[2:22:09] Richardros98: im energy starving sometimes on outlaw, if i kidney heal cheap offtar cheap maintar itsso much energy spent from stuns alone and then when i actually wanna pump im starved, not always but many times
[2:22:11] Dritzzts: @tatattv KEKW
[2:22:13] APieceOfLego: are you stopping on a specifc roll or just going ham now
[2:22:18] kswissbaby: I dont even play retail but makes sense
[2:22:18] dirtbagjimmy1021: seems mashy
[2:22:19] XyranthiaRose: You can make a macro for BTE that will only let you use it when you’re either in dance or subter. /cast [stance] Between The Eyes
[2:22:19] eZ_BFT: do you just have your trinket macrod with dance?
[2:22:29] gannicus7_: @Pikabooirl should you adrenaline rush in stealth before u open
[2:22:33] Dritzzts: do u just intuitively know when u have max combo points
[2:22:34] revan62: this is almost as complex as arms warrior rotation
[2:22:37] AlphaRavenQT: How much % Crit and Mastery  Outlaw need ?????
[2:22:38] Rettalius: what reset you looking for?
[2:22:40] wolfcy_94: @Grimm303 why tho? just curius, cause of ambush dmg?
[2:22:42] palakat77: Pika can we do just 3 games as Mage/Rog please i wanna show my friend how to play Rog lol
[2:22:53] eZ_BFT: ive just been pressing it separately
[2:22:54] Richardros98: sometimes when i meld restealth my between the eyes bugs and i can press it for some reason
[2:23:00] Grimm303: @Grimm303 Because ambush rolls extra buffs - pistol doesnt, so never use procs during sub window
[2:23:09] Stenjp: Show your macros!
[2:23:10] AlphaRavenQT: @Pikabooirl How much % Crit and Mastery  Outlaw need ?????
[2:23:15] XyranthiaRose: Don’t macro trinket to AR as if you use it in stealth the trinket will de stealth you.
[2:23:16] eyesoftheserpent: @pikabooirl  hows you're night going so far
[2:23:23] Grimm303: just higher dam to use ambush than pistol
[2:23:27] Thegina: @Thegina #showtooltip /cast [stance:0]Dispatch;[stance:1]Between The Eyes;[stance:2]Between The Eyes

[2:24:17] XyranthiaRose: How much crit unbuffed do you want to aim for?
[2:24:17] kellydean_: do you vanish off cd then?
[2:24:33] GadgetCopter: I feel like not using a WA for showing the buffs you get from Roll the bones is crazy
[2:24:36] eli_sundayx: Did I miss 3's?
[2:24:41] GadgetCopter: no idea how you can scan your buffs so quic
[2:24:46] mushy_perples: Could you between the eyes out of subterfuge if you have more than 45 seconds left on vanish cooldown and if shadow dance cooldown is longer than like 25 seconds?
[2:24:46] Promocodebaj: Damn Mitch Jones shit is wild
[2:24:47] averagenjoyerrrr: @eli_sundayx nar bout to start

[2:25:51] AlphaRavenQT: How much % Crit and Mastery  Outlaw need ?????
[2:25:51] Thegina: @Omfgbbqsauce BTE has no CD in stealth/SD and can proc CP to spam it
[2:25:51] allenlondon210: might need to start from scratch and make a rogue to learn the moves lol. Trying on my rogue i havent touched in years and no clue what im doing lol
[2:25:56] Grimm303: @Pikabooirl might wanna check on your pistol during subterfuge beta

[4:43:48] Zalelol: na cuz you'd lose in round 1 and then classic andys would laugh at the retail players :(
[4:43:49] Milano___: It's Snutz vs. the field
[4:43:50] NearSingularity: mages are going to be broken at 40 and new runes so xaryu would want you to duel

[4:44:18] Nolanrogue: only pika can take snutz out
[4:44:22] JikketyDooks: rogue don't get cloaks in classic they will always be ass
[4:44:26] isbre: pvp in classic is so cringe with all these misses and resists

[4:47:12] drbonghitmd: @bleenike getting ONE piece of pvp gear in classic takes longer than lvling 1-70 in retail in fact
