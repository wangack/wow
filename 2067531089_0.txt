[0:55:22] theDirtyon3: oh fuck yeah she got anduin
[0:55:23] Torri_Adore: Yeah and then the heros can get immune to being brainwashes by big powerful entities brought into existance with azerite crystals by beast tribes.
[0:55:29] theDirtyon3: thats huge
[0:55:40] Necoc: doesn't she have cats named after Anduin and Sylvanas?
[0:55:50] daikaiju73: The Gazlowe story sounds interesting
[0:55:54] dotonbori: oooo Goblin lore gimme!
[0:55:56] Nulgar: Damn gotta reread the Arthas book for comparisons and contrasts
[0:56:06] theDirtyon3: ooooooo
[0:56:06] Nulgar: Mabelly?
[0:56:12] Torri_Adore: "what is feels like to love and commit war crimes"
[0:56:16] AlanC2024: arator
[0:56:18] theDirtyon3: im already so fucking in for this
[0:56:19] jimbones64: Who doesn't have cats names Sylvania and anduin
[0:56:20] Necoc: Arator
[0:56:20] theDirtyon3: aratore
[0:56:21] JokerJoshHux: Before my wife passed we named our daughter Alexstrasza
[0:56:22] elbardo_ts: child
[0:56:26] redcrimtane: thalissurian?
[0:56:30] redcrimtane: oh lol
[0:56:35] neverbornlucky: Taliesin their son is called dipshit
[0:56:35] MeggoArt: Arator
[0:56:35] Atomicpanda: the lord of gifts
[0:56:36] HSAyril: For shame
[0:56:47] chryseis: Arator
[0:57:17] aurum2509: next expansion leak, world of warcraft: Andor
[0:57:23] magemaster225: theres a 4th chonicle book
[0:57:32] theDirtyon3: 4th chronicle too
[0:57:38] MeggoArt: There’s two (?) stories without a summary, I wonder who they’ll be about. Maybe xal’atath ?
[0:57:53] iamdrewonline: if book releases Nov 5th as pre expac, expac soon after?
[0:58:04] chryseis: Hoping for a Jaina story 🤞
[0:58:10] theDirtyon3: theres so much good WoW literatture coming out
[0:58:12] jimbones64: I had a friend who had a friend who wrote short stories about the people they met on wow
[0:58:27] jimbones64: They're published on amazon
[0:58:42] ebrahim_91: wait what is this
[0:58:44] FelPlague: I really hope blizz caves and just hires a ton of artists and makes hero classes change most if not all of your abilities visually, all they need is artists, and I am sure there is plenty who would love to do so.
[0:58:53] Nulgar: Again, the mistake was to advertise Chronicle as absolutely objective canon
[0:58:53] FelPlague: Would be such an ez win
[0:59:33] NotIeni: i kinda hated that the reconned(?) something right in the Legion... but you can see how bad it was by me not ever remembering what exactly it was :D
[0:59:33] aurum2509: people were so mad about it back then “RETCON RETCON”
[0:59:55] thunduz: that’s what I remember
[1:00:05] bomayaa: Aardvark!!
[1:00:09] Nulgar: Metzen making mistakes? Surely that cannot be true /s
[1:00:14] jimbones64: Retcons are so awesome.  It's just the deeper truth of what happened.
[1:00:15] maplelost: novem 5? i thought  expac was in summer
[1:00:56] Nulgar: Yeah like a "full discography" (forgot the term for albums) when the band is still active
[1:00:59] HSAyril: Expansion is between end of summer and falls

[1:02:47] kaijoe_: Didn't Asmon say something dumb like the hero talents mean TWW is already dead? lol
[1:02:55] MeggoArt: Gimme a wrathion one plssssss
[1:03:12] neverbornlucky: Taliesin this is just dragon flight voices all over again
[1:03:17] aurum2509: yeah I saw that video title and just thought how would you know already lmao
[1:03:18] cabeshpash: @kaijoe_ asmons takes on WOW in general are dumb lol
[1:03:28] Atomicpanda: asmon said something dumb?
[1:03:37] aurum2509: no wayyyyyyy @atomicpanda
[1:03:42] HSAyril: Be was watching Bellular and Matt trash on it and Asmons's video title was WW was dead
[1:03:45] maplelost: wasn't he just  reacting to Bellular saying ppl want class skins not class talents?
[1:03:46] KatieRet_: they're not as gameplay defining as something like covenants though
[1:03:48] Necoc: who listens to asmon?
[1:04:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin that award show was a lie. Twitch doesn't do reward shows well Asmongold didn't win  anything
[1:04:07] Thoreya: asmon makes a clickbait war within title aand gets 500k views in a day, love it
[1:04:10] mosart: it’s a reaction to the bellular video and the thumbnail is click bait as always. asmon was rather positive towards hero talents in the actual video if I remember correctly
[1:04:15] HSAyril: Then they all said brown rice wasn't more nutritional than white rice
[1:04:27] bomayaa: I wonder if Trump is related to Asmon
[1:04:45] aurum2509: I hate cluckbait titles
[1:04:48] maplelost: dont hate the playa hate the game
[1:04:49] RileyDoodles_: Like my Nan always said, if you haven't got anything nice to say, don't say anything at all :')

[1:05:26] doomer_dan_: @Necoc I do. I like asmongold. I think he is a very entertaining content creator, regardless of whether he has some dumb opinions or not.
[1:05:42] Jeanie130: Hi everyone
[1:05:43] neverbornlucky: Taliesin your stalker is not your editor he just steals your face and puts you in his videos
[1:05:47] Enigmio: i'm afraid that hero talents is just another way for blizzard to push more stuff into the store... i can already see class sets in the store...
[1:06:08] Trebled_Mind: speaking on that thumbnail issue, have you seen the scary shit OpenAI can do now?!
[1:06:08] Nulgar: "Danuser? The buck stops with him!!! Asmon? Oh, he doesn't do the thumbs snd highlights"
[1:06:10] mosart: yeah but you actually care about something other than the number of views the video gets LUL
[1:06:22] elbinn: Par for the course: join stream, see a wow topic on the screen but tali talking about everything else but wow
[1:06:31] cabeshpash: what wow novels are worth reading would you say?
[1:06:40] ebrahim_91: one of the stories will be Sylvanas : My time in the Maw.
[1:06:48] doomer_dan_: @cabeshpash The Arthas novel is fantastic. Highly recommend
[1:06:55] thunduz: yeah that would be dope
[1:07:07] cabeshpash: @doomer_dan_ arthas is my fav char so i'll check that out
[1:07:11] maplelost: does this hint the release date of the actual game? do books release before or after expac
[1:07:11] alextheblight: @cabeshpash Lord of the Clans and Tides of Darkness are pretty decent
[1:07:16] HSAyril: What are you talking about? He's talking about wow right now lol
[1:07:23] doomer_dan_: Before the Storm was really good!
[1:07:33] HSAyril: @maplelost typically before
[1:07:33] NotIeni: Why do people hate before the Storm? I thought it was great D:
[1:07:38] volkner_1: yesss, it was really enjoyable. but they didn't follow up much in game Wowee
[1:07:39] jimbones64: They should make warcraft wow novel mods
[1:07:41] MeggoArt: I think the most interesting thing here is arator showing up, this is potentially setting up that prophecy to be relevant in this expac
[1:07:43] witchhobbit: should you read the novels in order of release? or doesn't matter?
[1:07:45] elbinn: I really liked a lot of the short stories they did in DF
[1:07:51] aurum2509: I loved before the storm, and I also enjoyed war of the scaleborn
[1:07:51] PidiaP: I’m amazed they remembered Gazlowe exists, I wonder if they’ll fix that bit where they clearly wrote it for Gallywix but left it for Gazlowe and it made no sense
[1:07:51] thunduz: chronicle is for lore, novel is for adventure for me
[1:07:52] alextheblight: @alextheblight also Rise of the Horde and The Last Guardian
[1:07:53] doomer_dan_: Stormage was really good too
[1:07:58] Pannekaker: @TaliesinAndEvitel Yeah, I agree, I've read/listened to it several times!
[1:07:59] doomer_dan_: Stormrage*
[1:08:02] TheDeekins: there's an interesting divide I've noticed between people that really liked before the storm and people that really liked shadows rising
[1:08:04] theDirtyon3: Slyvanas was great yeah
[1:08:06] ebrahim_91: Sylvanas was amazing
[1:08:10] kaijoe_: Yeah, I dug Sylvanas
[1:08:21] alextheblight: I didn't like Shadows Rising, honestly
[1:08:30] skeletonetiquette: Sylvanas was solid for sure, especially with Patty doing the voice over
[1:08:31] PinkSharkie: I like the wow novels because I can put myself in the character's shoes and feel properly immersed in their story :>
[1:08:35] theDirtyon3: Shadows Rising was great
[1:08:40] chryseis: Tides of War is my favourite
[1:08:55] alextheblight: I only liked the Flynn and Shaw parts, tbh
[1:08:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin donald trump is selling cologne too you can smell like a ass just l like Trump
[1:08:59] theDirtyon3: I loved the Shadow and Light stuff
[1:09:01] dday_movies: glad to hear Tali is not a fan of war crimes. those are generally bad things
[1:09:01] witchhobbit: i started reading rise of the horde as my first wow novel because i saw more than one post about starting with that one
[1:09:04] aurum2509: war crimes is so all over the place
[1:09:19] AngryInternetCat: Now we know its the Jailers fault
[1:09:27] tempo119: flynn is daddy
[1:09:28] kaijoe_: Scaleborn also made me appreciate the in-game Dragonflight story more
[1:09:32] alextheblight: War Crimes is basically "Jaina is suffering"

[1:10:08] neverbornlucky: its ok for I Iszreal to do war crimes
[1:10:32] Atomicpanda: @neverbornlucky counterpoint, not it's not.

[1:11:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesin don't forget Star Wars Christmas Special
[1:11:24] cabeshpash: depends on the game imo, mmos are much more difficult to tell a coherent story in than a single player rpg
[1:11:30] Superponte: We kind of did in Comic books.
[1:11:35] Sennica95: Are the wow novels on audible?
[1:11:42] Nulgar: @tempo119 yep
[1:11:47] witchhobbit: i always found that i got the best fantasy out of reading than other things, as much as i enjoy videogames and tv/movies
[1:11:50] Arlaeya: I wish there just was an option in game. others can skip. and let me go BACK in case I missed something
[1:12:19] skeletonetiquette: I think the best is a media that utilizes the universe and brings life to things that are referenced but not a main beat. Main beats should be in game imo
[1:12:23] elbinn: i like the flynn and shaw travel stories a lot
[1:12:25] jimbowheat: I want a Zappboi novel.
[1:12:28] witchhobbit: @cabeshpash it really makes sense when you keep that in mind
[1:12:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin as much as we know they want to forget christmas special star wars we will never forget
[1:12:54] Atomicpanda: i want a banner bae novel

[1:14:57] witchhobbit: i have been really enjoying the new star wars shows, more than some of the movies
[1:15:03] daikaiju73: I'd like them to just make Boss Mida the new Bilgewater Trade Prince
[1:15:31] Vaephera: I just hope they don't delay it in the EU for several weeks for no reason. Again.
[1:15:33] Wenlocke: It;'s in the "tales from teh Mos Eisley cantina" if anyone hasnt read it and would like to track it down

[1:16:11] elbinn: i did
[1:16:12] frankenfoot5: I'm watching it now actually
[1:16:12] Atomicpanda: i did
[1:16:13] AlanC2024: seen it just as the stream started
[1:16:13] bomayaa: nope
[1:16:13] keyboardturner: Kappa i'm going to watch it soon
[1:16:13] Durwen: yup
[1:16:13] Vaephera: I just came back from watching it.
[1:16:14] NotIeni: yess
[1:16:14] kaijoe_: Working through it now. It's great
[1:16:15] Jehugasm: yes
[1:16:16] witchhobbit: loved it!
[1:16:16] Bassel0pe: i have
[1:16:16] Enigmio: i watched it
[1:16:17] bettys_dungeon_adventures: hey Tali, congratulations on your pregnancy. its a medical miracle!
[1:16:17] ResonantEchos: not yet
[1:16:17] Syllvn: Yup
[1:16:20] Sockfire: just watched it
[1:16:21] revan4686: yea was a banga
[1:16:21] skeletonetiquette: Absolutely did
[1:16:30] netonkent: Yep was great 💜
[1:16:31] jimbones64: There was a cheat code in the star wars strategy game where you could do that with the ewoks
[1:16:33] AssumptionPrime: I have it pulled up to watch, but now is stream time
[1:16:43] Arlaeya: not yet! okay muting you so I can watch....you
[1:16:53] elbinn: I thought you were very fair in it. And I agree with your point at the end. His 'legacy' is complex. Given an impossible task, made some major missteps, but created one of the best xpacs to set a foundations.
[1:16:54] keyboardturner: my initial thought upon seeing the thumbnail/title preview to this: "i'm sure twitter will be very open-minded and will totally listen to what will be said in the video with a level-headed calm discussion"
[1:17:03] witchhobbit: i didn't even think about looking at the comments LUL  i bet theyre good
[1:17:05] revan4686: loved the intro been to long since we have had one
[1:17:18] skeletonetiquette: I think it was pretty fair, you left Steve on the hook for a good bit, but you did absolve him of some minor things. All the while being like hey, don't treat people like shit, cause he's a human being.
[1:17:29] NotIeni: how are you suggest that liking a piece of disliked media doesnt make you a terrible person
[1:17:32] Syllvn: People always go all or nothing. It's much more nuanced as you described
[1:17:42] netonkent: Mine that hate Tali, you have a roof to repair haha 💜💜
[1:17:58] revan4686: people just don’t like facts tali
[1:18:09] warrenny: that was afrasisbi?
[1:18:10] bomayaa: self insert?
[1:18:15] maplelost: wasn't his linked-in profile literally the picture of the character
[1:18:15] warrenny: or someone ekse?
[1:18:19] bomayaa: I've not watched it
[1:18:23] daikaiju73: Teldrassil was one of Afrasiabi's last attention grabbers, wasn't it? Cheer100
[1:18:40] elbinn: @TaliesinAndEvitel I would argue he should have less blame placed on him for SF. He was given a characters direction (sylvanas) and tried to make it work. Jailer was awful as a character, but the xpac as a whole should be blamed on the ones prior to him
[1:19:08] Nulgar: @maplelost that sounds very, very unlikely. Even in general: Nobody who's actually using LinkedIn would use a joke profile pic
[1:19:25] MrScotticus: It's ok the like video game characters
[1:19:26] keyboardturner: sounds like projection

[1:19:40] kaijoe_: I've got a C'thun icon on my stupid Bnet profile but I'm not out here thinking he's my self insert lol
[1:19:40] skeletonetiquette: Hold on, let me introduce you to Thrall.
[1:19:44] Bradykin: The whole "discomfiting" warchief RP tweet was weird. But he's allowed to make a weird tweet, nothing wrong with that
[1:19:45] bomayaa: What character??
[1:19:47] alextheblight: Denathrius was pretty cool, so whoever wrote him can pat themselves on the back
[1:20:07] rws26: Nathanos is a great character
[1:20:21] tempo119: nathanos ruled
[1:20:29] maplelost: he cant make that npc sylvanas' lover
[1:20:34] PidiaP: Good thing Metzen has no self-inserts
[1:20:38] revan4686: @taliesinandevitel  if I was him there would be raid boss that looked like me an had my name everything it
[1:20:41] alextheblight: the whole "X character is a self-insert" was/is so dumb
[1:20:44] Vaephera: I think that "discomforting" tweet was just a joke that didn't really land
[1:20:48] kaijoe_: Excited to make my hunter the Danuser hero class come TWW
[1:20:51] NotIeni: Also I thought Sylavanas/Nathanos ship was suggested for ages, he didnt come up with it?
[1:20:53] elbinn: yes but that NPC is in trueshot lodge, trueshot lodge is for hunters, sylvanas is a hunter. seems sus hmmm
[1:21:30] alextheblight: people wanted red eyes for undead too
[1:21:35] bomayaa: people didn't like him RP'ing??
[1:21:37] thunduz: The Crimson Gaze or Gays? just trying to figure out who’s getting the props.
[1:21:49] skeletonetiquette: He's role-playing himself in WoW there yea?
[1:21:50] the_howlermonkey: Its pretty shitty to do self inserts unless you are Metzen... Who is SUPER cringey.. far cringier than Steve ever was... Mouthbreathers
[1:21:50] maplelost: he forgot his own lore LUL
[1:22:12] Nulgar: "not roleplaying as Nathanos - that means you're definitely roleplaying as Nathanos!" /s
[1:22:13] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:22:17] Bradykin: We always put a bit of ourselves in our characters
[1:22:20] Bradykin: i'd want a writer to do that
[1:22:21] Elsbereth: just checking in and wishing you all a good day o7
[1:22:33] elbinn: christ metzen would NEVER insert himself as a character in this game Kappa
[1:22:37] tempo119: deserves hate for being gigacringe
[1:22:43] thunduz: get the crimson gaze on the app store of google play. Blizz at microtransations again
[1:22:44] daikaiju73: I was unaware of this drama
[1:22:55] kaijoe_: Cringe has become the worst descriptor
[1:23:00] ourmanyfans: Danuser is perhaps a bit too enthusiastic about WoW lore: "cringe self-insert" Danuser stops interacting with the community as overtly: "oh my god he doesn't care about the lore"
[1:23:00] Necoc: @TaliesinAndEvitel am i allowed to blame him for Nathanos not being in Shadowlands at all?
[1:23:01] Atomicpanda: cruel and wrong is the love is in the air addle drop rate
[1:23:01] alextheblight: glad I spent so much time on fanfic forums when I was younger. Got all the "self-insert HypeRage " out of my system
[1:23:03] Bradykin: whether or not you think he's giga-cringe, he doesn't deserve hate for it
[1:23:16] jimbowheat: Jailor dialogue was not incredible.
[1:23:17] Elsbereth: @kaijoe_ cringe is almost a positive thing now :D
[1:23:19] thunduz: Pitiful Mortals
[1:23:23] the_howlermonkey: @tempo119 metzen is FAR cringier
[1:23:24] Harai_Ulfsark: i heard about that even before i started playing retail, some things spread like wildfire
[1:23:28] Kortinas: @atomicpanda right
[1:23:34] neverbornlucky: Taliesin is the Jailer donald trump ?
[1:23:36] kaijoe_: @Elsbereth We've almost come full circle
[1:23:40] sebnificant: It's a little bit like calling people saying reasonable things "simps"
[1:23:41] skeletonetiquette: Wait are self inserts categorically bad? Do we have to delete Thrall?!?!
[1:23:47] witchhobbit: this is just used to justify crapping on his life
[1:23:52] alextheblight: Avenger Metz, anyone?
[1:23:54] Bradykin: wait who's the third one
[1:23:56] Enigmio: if its good executed, why not
[1:23:57] jimbowheat: Thrall, Varion and ?
[1:23:58] elbinn: thrall was balding the same time as metzen
[1:24:03] bomayaa: does blizzard ever reveal exactly who created each character?
[1:24:06] Elsbereth: @kaijoe_ the circle of cringe LUL
[1:24:12] skeletonetiquette: The reindeer
[1:24:12] maplelost: or accurate
[1:24:25] jimbowheat: @skeletonetiquette ha! yes!
[1:24:30] alextheblight: LUL
[1:24:31] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:24:42] Sockfire: Ronin was a famous self-insert character in Warcraft too
[1:24:46] thunduz: Danuser is Nathanos then Sylvanas is Blizz. Kind of adds up now lol
[1:24:56] witchhobbit: mandom LUL
[1:24:57] jimbowheat: Metzen the reindeer?
[1:24:58] ButterStains: wait who is varían a self insert for?
[1:25:01] Vaephera: Medan?
[1:25:02] alextheblight: Me'dan
[1:25:04] MrScotticus: Med'an
[1:25:07] AlanC2024: medan
[1:25:13] thunduz: I mean the greatest hero of Azeroth
[1:25:14] alextheblight: med'an, rather
[1:25:22] Harai_Ulfsark: m'edan
[1:25:22] devilbride: deceDrachi weltre2HI steved7Hi steved7Twitchfam
[1:25:27] BlackRockWednesday: We are all Med'an Kappa
[1:25:31] jimbones64: Milhouse malstorm
[1:25:33] ButterStains: ohhhh
[1:25:33] alextheblight: god, med'an was so lame
[1:25:37] keyboardturner: I remember making a post similar to your video and got pretty heavily attacked for it lol
[1:25:41] ButterStains: I didn’t realize he voiced both of them
[1:25:42] thunduz: I mean Med'an wear's scarves so you do the math
[1:25:45] daikaiju73: Eh, not Medan. that was just lazy writing by Walt Simonson
[1:25:52] elbinn: In your video you said that on his way out, you heard Steve wasn't treated the best. Are you allowed to elaborate on that or no?
[1:25:55] Atomicpanda: but those two aren't dating our waifu
[1:25:58] skeletonetiquette: The leader of both the Horde and Alliance lol
[1:26:05] Syzmical: me'dan isnt really cannon, dont take it seriously personally
[1:26:17] daikaiju73: Agree to Disagree
[1:26:19] the_howlermonkey: If your surname ***tzen you could have pics of you banging your WOW realdolls and the community will rally around youn
[1:26:30] alextheblight: so glad it said "404" about med'an in Chronicle
[1:26:31] thunduz: @daikaiju73 yeah but walt made some pretty dope Xmen books so he gets a pass
[1:26:41] maplelost: he also stole everyones waifu
[1:26:43] Sir_Smitt: If we can al agree on one thing is that med an is terrible
[1:26:45] netonkent: I think that why these losers hate him, they see Steve as a cuck and matzen charters as a chaf
[1:26:50] netonkent: Chad
[1:26:54] Bradykin: does sylvanas ever even mention his dead?
[1:26:58] MeggoArt: everyone dunking on self inserts as if we wouldn’t all do the same thing if we were in charge of wow lore, I’ve seen how many of y’all’s RP characters act
[1:27:06] bomayaa: do people say novelists' characters are all self inserts?
[1:27:13] knightjudicator: @MeggoArt this too lol
[1:27:15] alextheblight: I liked Nathanos, tbh. He was a little over the top, but I appreciated him for what he was
[1:27:34] witchhobbit: yesssss
[1:27:34] keyboardturner: ever look around at RP characters and see how much they're self inserts? lol
[1:27:36] arcaneviolet: Her eyes go wide and she whispers his name all sad when the jailor tells her he is dead, if I remember correctly.
[1:27:40] thunduz: *slowly raises hand* My player character is a self insert
[1:27:44] neverbornlucky: Taliesin is upset cause hes not in the game yet
[1:27:45] bangoobangoo: Where is this self insert bashing happening? The forums?
[1:27:45] Sorin__: honestly people create their wow characters as such op self inserts
[1:27:50] HSAyril: Not that I think I'm better because of it, but I don't imagine I'd ever put myself in as a self insert for as an important character
[1:27:56] alextheblight: I don't care if people do, tbh
[1:27:56] thunduz: @keyboardturner tneEvi great minds
[1:28:07] ButterStains: A tuskarr preferably
[1:28:11] Necoc: self inserts are fine, depends entirely how they are written
[1:28:16] HSAyril: Tali will be put in as a Tusskar
[1:28:17] MeggoArt: hehe
[1:28:19] alextheblight: (again, spent a lot of time on fanfic forums as a teen)
[1:28:24] Wenlocke: if you ever get added to the game, will your intro soundbite be "I was right"
[1:28:25] Sir_Smitt: I also think that people would subconsciously put parts of themselves in characters without meaning to
[1:28:25] Atomicpanda: people only got upset because he was with sylvanus
[1:28:27] Syzmical: tali woulda make a good broker
[1:28:32] Wenlocke: "tali was right"
[1:28:34] jockstrapgaymerboy: I mean aren't we as the player character basically a self insert?!
[1:28:34] liveshowfieldy: surprised they didn’t name a tuskarr after you in DF tbh
[1:28:36] keyboardturner: i think borrowing qualities from yourself to put into a character is fine, just as long as it doesn't reach a point of being defensive if somebody doesn't like your character etc.
[1:28:41] witchhobbit: a bard!!!
[1:28:49] witchhobbit: tuskarr bard
[1:29:15] HSAyril: Haha Tali will be put in as a Tusskar and with clickable diaolague about being right
[1:29:27] keyboardturner: but like, that's more distancing yourself in a healthy manner, which, i'll be frank, a lot of people don't distance themselves *at all* when it comes to something bad happening to Sylvanas and Tyrande, and they never even wrote that character
[1:29:35] alextheblight: @keyboardturner I'm of that take too, yeah
[1:30:21] keyboardturner: no i'm talking about like, nelf fans going berserk about literally anything slightly negative to nelves lol
[1:31:13] alextheblight: the Lightning Paw part is sweet
[1:31:22] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I blame steve for my back pain
[1:31:27] Musihus: i think people are trying to place too much personal blame on employees at blizzard in general
[1:31:34] chief_hakoda_91: lmao it's in the asmon sub
[1:31:38] maplelost: literally has shitpost tagged
[1:31:47] BadXo: get "dark reader" chrome extension - flash bombs hurt
[1:31:56] WynneTheFox: This isn't Warframe!
[1:32:00] alextheblight: the Malfurion one is dumb. He's still mortal
[1:32:09] keyboardturner: nobody ever looks at tags on reddit
[1:32:09] Sir_Smitt: Wait when did malfurion become a demi-god?
[1:32:19] alextheblight: if you cut him, he'll bleed. If you plant an axe in his back, he'll bleed even harder
[1:32:19] keyboardturner: because this stuff is regurgitated via google searches
[1:32:22] Lausten: Classic r/Asmongold post lol
[1:32:46] grin1ing: r/asmongold LUL
[1:32:47] frankenfoot5: Hey Tali, just finished the new video. Really enjoyed your perspective and I can't wait for the new weekly vids!
[1:33:09] Atomicpanda: azeroth the takoyaki
[1:33:10] Syzmical: the sword actually is BIS, let me loot it
[1:33:14] Azallus: I will blame Danuser for the plot armor of Sylvanas in Shadowlands, he does not know how to write a villain. To me it felt like Sylvanas had read the script to the game, she always knew she'd come out on top and thus was always smug and snarky.
[1:33:20] alextheblight: :O
[1:33:25] grin1ing: D:
[1:33:26] tempo119: TRUE
[1:33:28] frankenpimp2: lies
[1:33:29] HSAyril: PREACH
[1:33:32] AlfredK: Who was it that connected Sargeras to Zovaal?
[1:33:48] grin1ing: You don't like Malf?
[1:33:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin tell us your STeve fantasy AI sora to come video porn
[1:33:50] netonkent: But that was about the tree so not steve
[1:34:11] ebrahim_91: Victory For Sylvanas is all I am hearing <3
[1:34:16] alextheblight: petty revenge for Garrosh (his baby boyt)
[1:34:16] verawarr: What that nasty man didn't get what he wanted
[1:34:19] alextheblight: boy*
[1:34:22] djalminnha: suits come in and sadi u cant kill Sylvanas
[1:34:51] keyboardturner: @neverbornlucky your comments are weird dude
[1:35:18] Volkien: Naw, its because we like sylvanas
[1:35:23] Volkien: the payers
[1:35:25] HSAyril: I don't
[1:35:29] ebrahim_91: Queeeeeeen
[1:35:38] ebrahim_91: u know I am liking this
[1:35:38] ebrahim_91: lol
[1:35:38] holyzeke: Talie I love the story as much as the next guy but the story isn’t gonna help me when I log on tonight
[1:35:39] Necoc: she's got corpo armor
[1:35:42] verawarr: Yeah cuz a fucking weirdo misogynist didnt get what he wanted. I'm glad
[1:35:46] Azallus: I haven't seen the latest weekly reset (yet), but her not dying is not the issue, she never even looks worried or concerned, never a "Holy fuck, I almost died", but just smug snarkiness all the time, it gets old REAL fast.
[1:35:49] Lausten: Cant kill off Franchise keywords like Sylvanas
[1:35:50] Musihus: Kotick big Sylvanas fan
[1:35:50] neverbornlucky: aww but you know the sora steve  videos are coming
[1:36:06] Azallus: An interesting villain is one that has to struggle a bit, and yet, fuck Afrasiabi, no arguments there.
[1:36:06] Volkien: She's got customer likes
[1:36:12] Azallus: *Yes
[1:36:36] witchhobbit: agreed
[1:36:39] Syzmical: It showed in Calia's story, so muddled because of all this strife internally.
[1:36:45] alextheblight: I didn't hate it, true
[1:36:53] Vaephera: Is sylvanas still trapped doing maw dailies?
[1:36:56] keyboardturner: I think Sylvanas had the best outcome for what they were given to work with at that point
[1:37:04] goblinintelligence: Sylvanas being a villain was probably going to be like Warcraft's Dark Phoenix.
[1:37:06] alextheblight: nathanos
[1:37:10] netonkent: Again the tree story not steve
[1:37:10] HSAyril: @vaephera as far as we know, yes
[1:37:29] netonkent: The night warrior was cool I will die on this hill
[1:37:36] Syzmical: how much stygia does sylv have at this point
[1:37:38] Musihus: crazy that there are 278k people in the world that want to be part of a Asmongold subreddit
[1:37:53] alextheblight: I can't imagine doing Maw dailies to this day
[1:37:57] astralumi: wtf LUL
[1:37:58] alextheblight: welllll
[1:37:58] Volkien: yeah
[1:38:03] Nulgar: HAVE THESE PEOPLE NOT PLAYED FUCKING WRATH OF THE LICH KING???????????????????????
[1:38:04] doomer_dan_: RIP Saurfang, MY GUY
[1:38:04] VeIenya: noooooooooo
[1:38:05] seanstrachan: He does.
[1:38:05] funviking99: wtf
[1:38:05] HSAyril: Night Warrior was cool, how it was handled at the end was stupid asf
[1:38:06] thunduz: no, no one can be saying that right?
[1:38:09] alextheblight: yeahhhhhh
[1:38:09] djalminnha: nope
[1:38:14] Phenroi: Shoulders off!!
[1:38:16] AlfredK: He's alright I guess
[1:38:16] elbinn: BFA saurfang is one of my favorite characters in all of wow
[1:38:16] Volkien: Whatever happened to cut foes in one blow?
[1:38:18] djalminnha: i dont think that
[1:38:20] rws26: I think these people think anything they didn't make sucks
[1:38:20] chief_hakoda_91: i mean his name is "sour fang"
[1:38:20] Atomicpanda: he's great
[1:38:22] funviking99: Saurfang doesn’t suck
[1:38:25] Lausten: Hell no, hes the most honorable badass orc ever to live
[1:38:25] VeIenya: he didnt suck. we was awesome
[1:38:25] doomer_dan_: nah saurfang was goated in bfa
[1:38:26] sm00kie2: that’s it. these opinions are shit and worth nothing
[1:38:28] Wenlocke: No, I think theyre trying to suggest that Saurfang should basically be Garrosh mk 2 rather than being the honourable warrior he is
[1:38:32] astralumi: his is one of my favorite story arcs from BFA
[1:38:33] BlackRockWednesday: I loved Saurfang in BFA :(
[1:38:34] Azallus: Saurfang was literally one of the best things about BFA!
[1:38:36] Sir_Smitt: he is lkike one of the best things in bfa
[1:38:38] ebrahim_91: I hate Saurfang just cause he went against Sylvanas, but he is an amazing char
[1:38:40] MeggoArt: This was the whole discourse this weekend - Portergauge made a long thread about it
[1:38:42] ramzie0: Saurfang's BFA armor is so sick!
[1:38:46] funviking99: facts
[1:38:47] sm00kie2: shit take from a shit person apparently
[1:38:48] xd_pad: Saurfang v Sylvanas was incredible
[1:38:50] BlackRockWednesday: Say sike
[1:38:52] bygodwest: he sucks because he showed emotions instead of just doing blade storm for the entire expansion in every cinematic
[1:39:00] daikaiju73: They just want to chuck everything into the dumpster.
[1:39:04] keyboardturner: LOL
[1:39:04] alextheblight: is that how you pronounce it?
[1:39:05] Syzmical: tali your a day mode on reddit user? im worried for your retnas
[1:39:05] Volkien: He sucked, he is an 'OLD" soldier. How did he lose to sylvanas? his wisdom meant nothing?
[1:39:06] theszoti: just arrived, please tell me this post is satire...
[1:39:08] grav_eler: In my opinion they are exaggerating, the characters had imperfections but most were not tragic at all... Which character in WoW is perfect and there is no nonsense in the lore? None
[1:39:10] elbinn: everyone literally took their shoulders off at the start of BFA because of him LUL
[1:39:17] seanstrachan: Yeah Porters tweet I agree with
[1:39:18] AssumptionPrime: Saurfang talked honor and wept for his son in fucking WRATH
[1:39:20] alextheblight: well yeah, he was pretty forward about that since BfA
[1:39:20] mrtame: Saurfang is the biggest reason to love the Horde though
[1:39:27] BlackRockWednesday: wot
[1:39:30] nyrhalahotep: the phrase "some people just want to watch the world burn." Didn't come about for shits and giggles.
[1:39:32] xd_pad: his wisdom saved the horde
[1:39:32] MeggoArt: he had critiques of the storyline, it was more nuanced than just “sucks”
[1:39:33] keyboardturner: for people who take themselves as being story lore experts, a lot of those people seem to be very illiterate idk
[1:39:33] Azallus: He was handled like shit in the duel against Sylvanas, because Blizzard can't write slashing weapons properly, but the fight is still cool, and Saurfang was badass. Him losing isn't the issue, but he could've done a LITTLE more.
[1:39:35] magisterofquelthalas: Hello friends, i hope everyone having a pleasing afternoon
[1:39:37] frankenpimp2: she was hopped up on jailer juice my guy
[1:39:42] Sorin__: sylvanas cheats
[1:39:45] thunduz: I mean Sylvanas isn't super young either lol She was a literal general
[1:39:47] BlackRockWednesday: Same with her vs Bolvar, everyone was surprised she was that strong
[1:39:51] KeyouiX: also techincally sylvanas is an old soldier
[1:39:52] Swaynee07: she also cheated
[1:39:53] Sorin__: that's like the whole thing that happens
[1:39:55] CrossroadsDealer: “I like soldiers who don’t get captured” -Donald Trump🤡🤡🤡
[1:39:56] alextheblight: that was great
[1:40:00] mrtame: Saurfang wasn't fighting Sylvanas, he was fighting Zovaal
[1:40:06] alextheblight: real "wait what" moment
[1:40:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin tell us how wow Sod is a failure plz
[1:40:14] seanstrachan: But it was also annoying that so much of the fallout from teldrassil was just about how sad it made him
[1:40:17] Vaephera: She also abandons being warchief as a result, so saurfang still kinda won
[1:40:19] chief_hakoda_91: she had to cheat
[1:40:21] magisterofquelthalas: Saurfang also landed a hit.
[1:40:26] Nulgar: Saurfang effectively WON that fight
[1:40:30] thunduz: tneEvi
[1:40:31] VeIenya: He wanted that she shows herself to the horde who she really is. so she left. Sylvie the dummy
[1:40:32] HeyheyReirei: that whole questline is still one of my favorites
[1:40:52] Volkien: Yes.
[1:40:54] BlackRockWednesday: 1000%
[1:40:56] keyboardturner: we really needed to see buildup for the jailer since like Legion tbh
[1:41:04] Sorin__: yeah but then we would have had some old design and would have never seen his big blue nips
[1:41:06] XxJagershotxX: I do think him trying purposely trying to just die twice over the course of two separate cinematics was a strange choice for me. But I don’t think he sucks
[1:41:07] Wenlocke: I would have wanted Saurfang to actually do a bit more damage and have some effect before Sylvanas basically said "screw it" and obliterated him
[1:41:09] Azallus: Saurfang was one of the best parts of BFA, no doubt. All the cinematics with him are awesome, and he's an old school badass.
[1:41:10] porcupinesyndrome: As much as I enjoyed the Mak'gora cinematic, I was slightly disappointed that it felt a lot like a repeat of the Mak'gora between Gul'dan vs Durotan
[1:41:12] thunduz: Jailor should have been as earlier as legion like you said last stream. As soon as Sylvanas sat on the throne
[1:41:16] mrtame: Bliz tried to make Thanos without Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies
[1:41:18] magisterofquelthalas: If Jailor was handled properly and introduced/hinted since Legion, everything would be better
[1:41:20] ourmanyfans: Saurfang kills Sylvanas, but then the Jailer revives her
[1:41:25] dwolf010: tbf thats becouse devs didnt know what would happen after the cliffhanger
[1:41:28] BlackRockWednesday: Big chestussy glistening in the Durotar sun
[1:41:30] Uttv32: To make it more beliveable, Sylvanas would had needed to get cornered first before using her powers
[1:41:32] theszoti: yeah, the jailer should have been teased at the end of legion or something
[1:41:33] seanstrachan: It's a long thread lol
[1:41:41] MeggoArt: I can send you the thread
[1:41:41] Harai_Ulfsark: how the cinematics contradict whats presented ingame, basically
[1:41:43] alextheblight: doesn't he have you muted?
[1:41:43] elbinn: Nothing ever felt like it ended in BFA/SL. I like Dragonflight because even though the next xpac is hinted, it felt like it had a conclusion.
[1:41:44] Wenlocke: @ourmanyfans That sounds cool. She falls over, banshees back up and cuts loose
[1:41:59] Syzmical: Day mode reddit is more unhinged than all of Shadowlands story combind
[1:42:10] Harai_Ulfsark: we knew about shadowlands and the jailer yes
[1:42:14] Bradykin: They likely hadn't finalized the jailer's visual design at that point, but they had the story planned out at least partially for SL at least
[1:42:16] verawarr: I'm not a huge fan of saurfang tbh it felt like some characters were being sacrificed on the altar of his arc, sylvanas being one of them but thats another tangent
[1:42:17] elbinn: I dont think at that point. Because there were videos speculating about her shadowy power
[1:42:52] keyboardturner: I was mentioning Shadowlands references in Legion, it was hinted from Chronicle and from ingame story lore
[1:42:55] KatieRet_: don't they always say they work 2 expansions in advance?
[1:42:57] thunduz: didnt they say they know what expansion is next 2 years before the newest one comes out?
[1:43:09] Durwen: at the time, the jJailer was totally the Primus, I think
[1:43:14] mrtame: elbinn I think that could partially be because from 8.3 through Shadowlands the antagonist forces grew far beyond the mortal scope we were comfortable with
[1:43:23] Syzmical: Tali did you enjoy the Oribos central hub and disconnected zones of SL? (pretty off topic of narative)
[1:43:25] keyboardturner: @thunduz next 2 expansions rather, not necessarily 2 years
[1:43:37] theszoti: didn't they say during bfa that they plan 2 expansions in advance? which would mean that they wanted to take story there by legion
[1:43:50] ourmanyfans: @Wenlocke Also givesz more credence to the 5D chess thing (even though it's a stupid argument) I'm imagining something like the storyline in BG3
[1:44:01] keyboardturner: airport city
[1:44:04] AlfredK: I wish we would have gotten more of Denathrius instead of the main story we got with the jailer
[1:44:09] Archiduss: The FTL travel was kinda cool though.
[1:44:18] neverbornlucky: Taliesin did you  enjoy a certain shaman talking with his mom though ?
[1:44:21] Nulgar: I didn't mind Oribos as capitals usually suck, the Covenant Sanctums were better, not as crowded
[1:44:25] Bradykin: I often don't even notice when i've moved between zones in DF. The blend areas are well donew
[1:44:38] Trebled_Mind: I’ll never be a wow achievement completionist because it would mean me having to actually play Shadowlands.
[1:44:53] ActuallyArcane: Nothing quite like coming out of the travel to the gorgeous zones, gotta say that still got me
[1:44:57] BurtikShaun: primus
[1:44:57] elbinn: Primus
[1:44:59] alextheblight: Primus?
[1:45:01] xd_pad: the real jailer
[1:45:02] mrtame: Denathrius
[1:45:03] Durwen: the Primus?
[1:45:07] BlackRockWednesday: the guy with the thing
[1:45:08] theszoti: i'm still mad anduin didn't meet with his mom
[1:45:14] Nulgar: Maw stuff? tneTali
[1:45:15] alextheblight: Mograine showing up was pretty cool
[1:45:23] ActuallyArcane: YES
[1:45:29] KatieRet_: the flashbang in bastion
[1:45:37] ActuallyArcane: Shouldve been portals later though
[1:45:43] XxJagershotxX: i probably have one of the biggest hot takes, but I genuinely really enjoyed playing through torghast every week.
[1:45:46] xd_pad: the Kael'Thas questline was cool
[1:45:46] Volkien: How did we not know denatrius was betraying when he never wondered or cared about sylvanas?
[1:45:53] redcrimtane: maldraxxus guitar riff EZ
[1:45:58] ourmanyfans: Of the portals had connected the zones themselves rather than requiring you to go through oribos I think that'd been better
[1:46:03] Syzmical: Valdrakken kicks ass and feels they built from there outwards
[1:46:05] SGStream: Shadowlands zones feel really small now with the new view distance
[1:46:09] alextheblight: Gauntlet was fun
[1:46:11] ActuallyArcane: Denathrius deserved more story
[1:46:19] theszoti: i hated torghast but absolutely loved horrific visions
[1:46:20] netonkent: 9.0 was one of the best story just went down after that
[1:46:22] Theorof: I enjoyed shadowlands more than not.
[1:46:24] Kydar: I loved Torghast until the day Shadowlands ended, carrying people and exploring
[1:46:24] DarthTaz0: I enjoyed Torghast. Playing in groups was a ton of fun
[1:46:25] mrtame: Torghast coulda been fine if it wasnt Choreghast
[1:46:42] alextheblight: and very rude*
[1:46:44] keyboardturner: he was an asshole and I liked him for that
[1:46:49] sm00kie2: I did enjoy shadowlands but yeah the end with the jailer felt like it was a let down
[1:46:56] verawarr: you mean since vanilla
[1:46:59] Nulgar: wait, how "brought back"? Did they watch the cinematics out of order?
[1:47:02] Arlaeya: Nathanos certified asshole forever
[1:47:11] astralumi: he was such a snarky asshole, i loved to hate him :D
[1:47:13] dday_movies: I am more positive on Shadowlands because, even though I’ve play off and on since like 2007, shadowlands was the first time I really dove into endgame with friends. Still not a big endgame guy, but it was a fun part of the game I experienced for the first time there
[1:47:14] alextheblight: best stinky boy
[1:47:29] Arlaeya: there's even a Eon's Fringe quest where you makes you kill ducks because he hates birds... of course he does
[1:47:41] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do you think that Last Epoch will be the palworld of ARPG's and Blizzard diablo4 will be nintendo this time ?
[1:47:59] VeIenya: I didnt liked him. weirdo. boring. ugly. did he even had character?^^'
[1:48:06] alextheblight: wait, nathanos is in df?
[1:48:09] Nulgar: never got the complaints about wounds, but then again, I actually played those WQs instead of just flying over them
[1:48:13] Vaephera: Did danuser even work for blizz during MoP?
[1:48:14] alolanwingull: For me the greatest part of Shadowlands was Castle Nathria, the fights the theme the music
[1:48:17] theszoti: didn't baine and anduin become friends in mop?
[1:48:20] alextheblight: yep
[1:48:25] elbinn: Didnt baine and anduin becomes friends in Cata?
[1:48:26] mrtame: @dday_movies This was the only reason I made it through SL. I had not participated in end game raiding for several xpacs
[1:48:27] Arlaeya: @alextheblight A past version of him shows up in Eon's Fringe on some days
[1:48:34] TankenFunk: Just got here, sorry if I missed context, but I really hate posts like this, cause it's always twisting the characters into something the poster personally dislikes and puts it forward as absolute fact
[1:48:37] Nulgar: "building"
[1:48:43] keyboardturner: Isn't that also just in the nature of the tauren to reach out to the Alliance more than other factions of the Horde do
[1:48:50] REAPER_Replicator: people forget the blood elf and the taurant where almost alliance
[1:48:55] alextheblight: @Arlaeya oh wow, never seen that. Neat
[1:49:08] Bradykin: If anything, Talanji was a missed opportunity
[1:49:18] BlackRockWednesday: Baine has been friends with anduin from basically the start of anduin's story
[1:49:26] viliman1: rastakhan had to die there, it gave weight to that raid
[1:49:44] Bradykin: She got malfurion'd. Happens to the best of us
[1:49:51] TankenFunk: Rastakhan had a proper story during BfA. His own hubris led to him salvaging what little he could while dooming his entire bloodline. Shitty dude, awesome character
[1:49:52] alextheblight: Jaina should have been the one leading the attack, by the way, Not Genn
[1:50:00] astralumi: what?? jaina's story in BFA was amazing wtf
[1:50:08] alextheblight: true
[1:50:08] magisterofquelthalas: Blood elf yes, but tauren? I think they were planing going neutral. Garrosh almost made the Horde dissolve
[1:50:09] Shanhayde: But jaina gave herself up right ?
[1:50:14] Shanhayde: Like, it doesn't make sense
[1:50:16] mosart: But the jaina stuff isn't about a manly man, Tali. That means it's bad
[1:50:17] daikaiju73: "Feels in my Wow! HOW DARE THEY!"
[1:50:18] Sikuq: rastakan had some great quads
[1:50:19] thunduz: I think I remember people hating on the Jaina stuff
[1:50:21] grav_eler: I think this post was written by someone who don't play wow Kappa
[1:50:24] funviking99: I love how Jaina’s mom forgave her , that was sweet
[1:50:29] AuroraFighting: Jaina was my favorite part of BfA and I main Horde.
[1:50:30] TankenFunk: Jaina should've been a dreadlord. Missed opportunity
[1:50:32] Lausten: Jaina is a Dreadlord arc right?
[1:50:32] zeckzeckzeck: Please use her full name, Dreadlord Jaina
[1:50:33] aeson_of_raid_sock: no hugs
[1:50:34] Vaephera: I have definitely seen a lot of people thinking "good story" means "gets in lots of fights and wins, never confronts emotions". I can believe this person believes this post.
[1:50:34] TankenFunk: smh my head
[1:50:43] Vamir77: a dreadlord
[1:50:47] Shanhayde: I LOVE that she didn't become a villain, she was nothing like this when she went through awful shit
[1:50:49] neverbornlucky: Taliesin , Jaine is Human we forgive humans not everyone else
[1:50:55] Jeanie130: lol so true
[1:50:56] thunduz: any woman is on a villain arc #WinterQueenEvil
[1:51:10] Nulgar: Jaina as vengeful and thinking her father was right was the thing she had to overcome in BfA
[1:51:28] TankenFunk: Oh yeah, when The Winter Queen was apparently the REAL evil and the Jailer, doomer of dooming all that is doomed, was apparently just misunderstood
[1:51:37] ActuallyArcane: #JusticeForLadyAshvane
[1:51:37] Lenitas: I feel like "Jaina is a dreadlord" was originally legitmately a shitpost
[1:51:44] jmalmin: Asmongold has not read quest text ever. He is always in a rush to get to max level so he does not read so of course he has seen 1/5 of the story.
[1:51:50] alextheblight: @Lenitas it was. Jesse Cox started it as a joke
[1:51:52] Bradykin: Jaina stuff is the best part of BFA imo
[1:51:55] HSAyril: She was a villian when she abandoned Variann :madge:
[1:52:06] Bradykin: who is Yrel again
[1:52:11] AngryInternetCat: Im happy Jaina is nice again. Loved her in Warcraft 3
[1:52:17] neverbornlucky: humans get away with everything only the horde is the bad guys
[1:52:18] Lenitas: @alextheblight I knew it was Jesse yeah, but I don't remember the way he originally brought it up
[1:52:18] thunduz: Yrel hasn't been turned into anything but a forgotten memory lol
[1:52:23] alextheblight: @Bradykin the main draenei lady from WoD with the fancy horns
[1:52:24] HSAyril: Religious zealot forcing people to follow her or die sounds like a villain to me
[1:52:28] seanstrachan: She's a villain from Mag'har pov
[1:52:32] magisterofquelthalas: Sunreavers and the tradegy in Dalaran was a biproduct of several misfortunes of warcraft history.
[1:52:42] keyboardturner: We saw the POV of the orcs, not both sides in that story
[1:52:43] zeckzeckzeck: male orcs, deserve redemption
[1:52:44] Volkien: a righteous person would be understanding. her actions felt callous
[1:52:46] elbinn: yeah but Grommash yelled "draenor is free" so its fine
[1:52:46] astralumi: that's a good point. it's all from a single unique perspective
[1:52:48] jmalmin: Yrel came into conflict with Hellscream. Most of her army are full of Orcs.
[1:52:51] VimFuego1970: takes one to know one
[1:52:59] alextheblight: @Lenitas it was basically a quip. He said something to the effect of "she's changed. DREADLORD!" as a joke
[1:53:04] Vamir77: I wish that characters in WoW did more darker antihero stuff. like I don’t think Jaina sending a tidal wave on Orgrimmar would have been badass. Like that wouldn’t have made her a villain. I’d make her hard.
[1:53:05] Vidaloo: She is... in another universe... also don't we agree that it's like a different timeline? Not the same as the one we had in WoD?
[1:53:08] MikeyGy: he's an orc and has an axe duh Kappa
[1:53:09] Volkien: The Mag'har
[1:53:13] seanstrachan: Get kidnapped by Gul'dan apparently
[1:53:13] xd_pad: Grom killed a pit fiend. He is strong
[1:53:16] Durwen: Apparently, no one ever lies in this game
[1:53:16] HSAyril: He's a villain so he knows one when he sees one
[1:53:36] AngryInternetCat: He was a baddie in wc2 xD
[1:53:39] Volkien: The mag'ar orcs are baddies?
[1:53:42] Lenitas: @alextheblight Yeah that checks out, def sounds like Jesse xD
[1:53:53] The_Action_Man: "Why is Yrel fighting against us we're trying to wipe out her people? SHE MUST BE EVIL" LUL
[1:53:57] magisterofquelthalas: Well last time we heard of her was she was trying to forcefully convert ppl to become lightforged. But again, she probably hasnt been worse than Turalyon. Light seems to have a way of making zealots out of heroes
[1:53:57] alextheblight: coxChicken
[1:54:01] Leterius: Well we are talking AU Yrel, not main U Yrel - there is a Universe where everyone is evil
[1:54:04] keyboardturner: I do have a theory personally that the Light is to cause for Draenor dying, and we saw the exact same thing happening with the Warlands time rift as it's the same situation of Light zealot alliance vs. "junker" horde
[1:54:05] ShadowDragon14855: ShadowDragon14855 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Morning all
[1:54:07] HSAyril: MAGA orcs?
[1:54:23] Bradykin: I think a lot of people find the "light nazi" story interesting and are inclined to it. That doesn't mean its the one being told. I like the idea narratively, but it's currently just a possibility.
[1:54:28] einomar: einomar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! Woop woop
[1:54:31] Archiduss: Wasn't that a flashback or forward alternative history or something with Yrel?
[1:54:35] AssumptionPrime: I gotta say, if the story does not ever present us with a different POV, or even hinted directly in its own storytelling that the perspective we have is shaky, I’m not inclined to doubt what it tells us. I think “only the orcs say she’s bad” is being overly generous to a thinly written allied race story, honestly. (Not a hater, just did not enjoy that storyline)
[1:54:43] VimFuego1970: do MAGA Orcs wear golden hi tops?
[1:54:47] Nulgar: @Lenitas I think it was a joke article on WoW Insider (predecessor of BlizzardWatch)
[1:54:57] HSAyril: @archiduss it was a story from after BFA
[1:54:58] neverbornlucky: Taliesin why are  Orcs Maga and not humans ?
[1:55:13] HSAyril: @vimfuego1970 haha
[1:55:21] Syzmical: hes redeemed by his Orc bravado
[1:55:28] frankenpimp2: that is not what happened though
[1:55:33] Vamir77: Grom isn’t a liar though
[1:55:36] Lenitas: @Nulgar Nah I think it was Jesse Cox
[1:55:49] keyboardturner: xera bad = light bad = draenei bad Kappa
[1:55:51] HSAyril: Is it free will if your choice is follow or die?
[1:55:56] BlackRockWednesday: He's certainly not trustworthy
[1:56:05] Volkien: Well time have proven her wrong. He kicked the demon's behind
[1:56:07] Vamir77: he’s view lying as dishonorable and weak
[1:56:15] alextheblight: there was 40 years of peace on alternate Draenor after WoD, so maybe?
[1:56:21] aurum2509: he got captured and then freed him, obvious redemption
[1:56:23] REAPER_Replicator: na man the orcs just wane do wat the Dutch, English and Spanish did, colonise there way tneTali
[1:56:34] The_Action_Man: I thought we were the ones that kicked the demons' behind
[1:56:47] alextheblight: no fel
[1:56:49] daikaiju73: I gave him so much side eye when he was proclaiming victory in the Legion cinematic.
[1:56:50] dday_movies: I guess he just has the same name and face as old Grom, so people just give him the benefit of the doubt lol
[1:56:51] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can you just say the Jailer is Donald Trump and the boy king is Joe Biden
[1:56:56] skeletonetiquette: Should we trust Guldan?
[1:56:59] thunduz: He's not the baddie of WOD, He saved all of us
[1:57:05] aurum2509: erm
[1:57:07] Volkien: The mag ar orcs aren't portrayed as baddies to horde players
[1:57:11] Vamir77: not saying to trust him, but Grom isn’t a liar or trickster
[1:57:14] alextheblight: also the whole "the light is oppressive" has been a thing since Legion
[1:57:16] einomar: Are people still on the Yrel hate train? At least wait until we know more of that story.
[1:57:18] HSAyril: Was the scenario just based on listening or Gromm? Didn't we go and actually help them?
[1:57:20] AssumptionPrime: By that same token, Tali, who’s to say they ARE destroying the planet? It’s Yrel and her side which are at this point in a religious war against the orcs.
[1:57:20] VimFuego1970: I had enough of Grom when he tried to sell me Golden G hi top sneakers
[1:57:25] XxJagershotxX: as a paladin main, from a role playing standpoint, I’d love it if the light made me a baddie for an expac, but that’s just me
[1:57:29] magisterofquelthalas: Clearly we need a second WoD expansion to solve the issue here xD. Nah i am joking, we know very little to none, i agree.
[1:57:39] skeletonetiquette: But honestly I think it's just part of a desire of the community to see the light be bad
[1:57:43] Volkien: maybe
[1:57:49] thunduz: yes
[1:57:51] Nulgar: I think they're thinking of the Frostwolves
[1:57:51] elbinn: Iron Horde Mag'Har
[1:57:56] Volkien: I have to go check
[1:57:58] HSAyril: Sounds like you're saying MAGA orcs lmao
[1:58:01] KeyouiX: the allied race are the AU ones though
[1:58:02] CeasiusPls: they are the children of baddies
[1:58:08] Volkien: I feel you are right to
[1:58:10] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien Not check, verify youre wrong
[1:58:13] Volkien: tho*
[1:58:13] alextheblight: well, Garrosh was pretty MAGA about the orcs
[1:58:15] Syzmical: thinking about it, maybe WoD had comparably muddled narative as Shadowlands, have we gotten more critical over time LUL
[1:58:17] REAPER_Replicator: omg
[1:58:19] HSAyril: Make Azeroth Great Again
[1:58:21] keyboardturner: @Nulgar Kappa would be a shame if the playable mag'har are literally canonically every clan tho
[1:58:26] thunduz: get them receipts
[1:58:27] aurum2509: this is just the WoW community’s “oh well the light is slightly more nuanced than we think so they must be the baddies”
[1:58:29] Tmicrochip: I know you're saying Maghar but I keep hearing MAGA Orcs! lol XD
[1:58:29] frankenpimp2: when they were fueled by demon blood and manipulated my kiljaden yeah, they destroyed the planet and are just baddies. regular maghar orcs are just as good or bad as any race on azeroth and could be reasoned with
[1:58:30] DR0G0TH: Howdy Tali. I took today off and it's nice to catch a live stream for once.
[1:58:30] Jeanie130: What a weird thing not to trust you on lol
[1:58:31] elbinn: I gotta go check facebook to find information that helps my POV
[1:58:33] Harai_Ulfsark: you literally talk with occuleth to go to the alternative draenor
[1:58:46] DR0G0TH: Grom felt bad about it W.W
[1:58:50] netonkent: We should do a list of metzens L's would be much longer than Steve lists
[1:59:03] magisterofquelthalas: And i would like to add. Maghar Orcs from Outland willingly joined Garrosh's army and thought he was taking the Horde to a right place.
[1:59:05] knightjudicator: @frankenpimp2 if they use the Iron Horde tech, they could still be destroying Draenor
[1:59:15] Bradykin: I think people also mix up "the mag'har orcs" and "the frostwolf orcs"
[1:59:17] Volkien: You are right Talie. You will rue the day, someday
[1:59:17] Vidaloo: Hold on, but that's not very ethical still. At the end of WoD the Mag'Har are allied with the Draenei, moreover they say that  they will rebuild TOGETHER in the cinematic. So that kinda sound like that wasn't the path to go if you were trying to destroy the planet. You'd probably try to work together no?
[1:59:17] einomar: MAGA orcs *shudders*
[1:59:20] thunduz: scuse me m'lady but actually the iron legion orcs were the baddies but the frostwolf helped us
[1:59:21] alextheblight: Yrel called him a friend in the scenario, so he probably did at some point
[1:59:23] DR0G0TH: "Draenor is Free" -Distraction!-
[1:59:25] zeckzeckzeck: he said sorry in the promotional tie-in with taco bell, but not in game
[1:59:28] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien boy, you got him
[1:59:32] magisterofquelthalas: Only Maghar i thought high of was Saurfang the Younger :)
[1:59:38] bucephalos: Exarch Hellscream joined the Draenei
[1:59:45] BlackRockWednesday: I thought that ending was SO bizarre
[1:59:46] magisterofquelthalas: And he died terribly :(
[1:59:49] AssumptionPrime: I mean, Durotan and Draka are also fighting against Yrel? if we have to ask who’s to say the orcs aren’t destroying Draenor, who’s to say that they ARE?
[1:59:50] knightjudicator: @Vidaloo yeah and thats the point: why the fuck make Yrel a villain now because everyone said they would work together LMAO
[2:00:00] BlackRockWednesday: "Draenor is free? MFer YOU DID THIS"
[2:00:02] DR0G0TH: Warcrimes swept under the ruh
[2:00:12] aurum2509: it’s because Yrel is a woman and all angry women are baddies obviously
[2:00:15] DR0G0TH: @BlackRockWednesday That's not very blackrock of you
[2:00:44] xMortal_Wombatx: Aren't the Mag'har Orcs (the allied race) the ones from Draenor?
[2:00:44] netonkent: working Together where the war in warcraft 😝
[2:00:47] Vamir77: tali if you could have a redo of any expansion which one would you choose?
[2:01:21] Lausten: They were literally fuel for the portal
[2:01:26] Volkien: Now you have shattered my whole narrative as to why I must hate Yrel.
[2:01:32] Vidaloo: @knightjudicator I know but that wasn't a good look on her in that allied race intro though, she didn't seem very conciliatory in my opinion haha
[2:01:33] MeggoArt: this Yrel convo always drives me insane because I’ve heard from a prev dev that this all happened to her because of behind the scenes drama with afrasiabi
[2:01:35] HSAyril: Did we just listen to Gromm tell the story in the scenario or did we go back and actually help them?
[2:01:48] cardrenn: if I recall right, the only thing that give the impression that Yrel is evil were the allied race quest, with that whole light invasion cenario
[2:01:55] KeyouiX: @HSAyril its the mag'har orc recruitment quest
[2:02:01] DR0G0TH: Yeah we don't really get to see it outside the Maghar POV
[2:02:01] i_identify_as_a_mistake: didn't the Orcs commit genocide in both realities?
[2:02:16] frankenfoot5: Tali is british, he knows what he's talking about here folks
[2:02:23] Volkien: lol
[2:02:25] AssumptionPrime: I mean, I played that questline, the Draenei came off very badly in the events we are actually present for
[2:02:27] Harai_Ulfsark: @HSAyril we see gorgrond all destroyed and turned into a barren, and light forces attacking the maghar
[2:02:28] DR0G0TH: @i_identify_as_a_mistake Orcs are nexus murder beings

[2:02:34] bucephalos: Groms Son even joined the Draenei
[2:02:35] keyboardturner: @frankenfoot5 kwkl LuL
[2:02:43] HSAyril: @keyouix I know, but I'm wondering if we witnessed Yrel being a Ligjy nazi ourselves or just taking his word for it
[2:02:51] holyzeke: so you’re saying us Americans should still hate the British lol
[2:02:55] DR0G0TH: @bucephalos Garrosh never wrong in any universe
[2:02:56] neverbornlucky: Taliesin are you going to play last epoch on feb 21st?
[2:03:00] Vidaloo: Yeah sure there's doubt, but that seems very sus to me haha
[2:03:10] Ella_bebe: Would it be a good story though?
[2:03:11] DR0G0TH: Yeah fuck em
[2:03:15] KeyouiX: @HSAyril she shows up at the of the quest line
[2:03:15] frankenfoot5: The British hate the British
[2:03:45] HSAyril: I hate the British so much I make my tea in the microwave
[2:03:51] neverbornlucky: Donald Trump is  the Jailer

[2:04:15] thunduz: <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[2:04:22] frankenfoot5: That's the closest thing to a hate crime against the Brits that I can think of
[2:04:28] AssumptionPrime: I just, this is being very generous to that Mag’har recruitment story. It was very quick and even as someone who liked WoD on the whole, came off as very slapdash and not well conceived
[2:04:30] ActuallyArcane: LOL That caught me off guard
[2:04:33] TankenFunk: I hate the British so much I don't follow the directions on the teabags and I just pray to God instead

[2:04:56] DR0G0TH: @TankenFunk I pray to god and he turns the tea into wine
[2:04:57] keyboardturner: didn't... Thrall have a whole sad arc in Cataclysm and we had to go through a whole questline to reunite his split parts and emotions
[2:05:04] KeyouiX: the questline has yrel blaming the orcs for the destruction of the world, and then grom says it's the light, then yrel says it pains her to kill an old friend.
[2:05:07] aurum2509: @databob1 never expect it
[2:05:12] AngryInternetCat: Sad old daddies are great
[2:05:12] Bradykin: I aspire to be a sad old man when I grow up
[2:05:20] neverbornlucky: Taliesin, Joe Biden is a sad old Man

[2:05:21] keyboardturner: am i misremembering his sad arc in Cata
[2:05:25] Vidaloo: Yeah Thrall was good in BfA, no questions. The only people that don't like Thrall in BfA are the people that miss Green Jesus
[2:05:29] rowanoaken: Thrall is awesome, full stop

[2:05:44] keyboardturner: @neverbornlucky yes, but so is like very other leader and presidential candidate Kappa

[2:05:52] databob1: @aurum2509 LOL
[2:06:01] thunduz: no him going and getting thrall and saying "we don't get to hide" was amazing
[2:06:23] elbinn: I wonder if this guy has even played this game and pays attention to it.
[2:06:29] neverbornlucky: Taliesin just said he likes Joe Biden cause he is a sad old man
[2:06:29] thunduz: yep
[2:06:43] frankenpimp2: that one is valid
[2:06:48] mosart: oh no it's the asmongold subreddit... One of the biggest "centrist"(right wing) circle jerks there is NotLikeThis
[2:07:02] alextheblight: looking through my screenshots of the mag'har scenario. I forgot they brought gronn and ogres with them to Azeroth
[2:07:09] elbinn: Only thing I dont like about N'zoth is it should have been more central of story from the start.
[2:07:10] CeasiusPls: cause the eye tower
[2:07:15] TankenFunk: Cause a tower fell, Tali. Towers only fall in LoTR
[2:07:16] Necoc: do they mean the buildings toppling?
[2:07:19] Durwen: Thats what LOTR needs. More lasers
[2:07:20] thunduz: You don't remember when Frodo used the ring to shoot lazer beams?
[2:07:23] frankenpimp2: not so much the lazer beam, but nzoth had so much wasted potential
[2:07:23] aurum2509: this post can’t be for real
[2:07:24] Vidaloo: Yeah you don't remember when Aragorn threw that giant laser beam at the end of Return of the King?
[2:07:28] einomar: Seems like this reddit person skips cut scenes and quest text xD
[2:07:31] Lausten: Poster clearly thought of eye beams and failed to say Cyplops
[2:07:33] keyboardturner: darkmoon fair is a LOTR ripoff DansGame
[2:07:36] AngryInternetCat: Ogres are from azeroth, i think
[2:07:38] Bjerreh: when its blizzard its a ripping off
[2:07:43] frankenfoot5: And with a homage you are typically honoring the original!
[2:07:50] CeasiusPls: Wratheon did the Arya Stark Dagger swap
[2:07:53] AngryInternetCat: Are they?
[2:07:54] rowanoaken: LoTR with lasers would be epic
[2:07:56] daikaiju73: Notice me Sauron sempai!
[2:08:02] REAPER_Replicator: wait next lightsabers in Lord of the Rings
[2:08:17] aurum2509: my favourite crossover
[2:08:22] HSAyril: THE CARE BEAR STARE
[2:08:24] frankenfoot5: Wait, Tali, canonically did my guildmates die in BFA 8.3 raid?
[2:08:28] alextheblight: true
[2:08:31] elbinn: It felt a little too similar to using the artifacts at end of legion.
[2:08:46] MeggoArt: hard agree
[2:08:48] CeasiusPls: btw the fish has the same voice as Azeroth
[2:08:50] aurum2509: @frankenfoot5 no
[2:08:51] keyboardturner: also they had a cool plan to make a portal from the chamber into the n'zoth thing to directly channel the power of azeroth through and megablast it, like that's actual cool tactics
[2:09:03] REAPER_Replicator: i believe he played use all, and we will see it in the void expension
[2:09:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesin when does Naga  become a third race
[2:09:09] magisterofquelthalas: Also nothing happened that was not planned to him. Nzoth has a bigger plan!
[2:09:12] Nulgar: The fucking very same people that complained about the N'Zoth cinematic now complain about the Fyrakk cinematic not involving the player. No, seriously.
[2:09:16] alextheblight: I didn't like they gave him slit irises when he had round ones in the Azshara cinematic, honestly
[2:09:20] magisterofquelthalas: Azshara cinematic was great
[2:09:48] holyzeke: the arbiter sees all!
[2:09:51] magisterofquelthalas: I think cinematic team has been only gettlning better.
[2:09:51] AssumptionPrime: Ah yes! Beloved and ruined character… The Arbiter?
[2:09:55] aurum2509: it wouldave been cool if there were like N’zoth shrines in Boralus and Dazaralor to add more flavour
[2:09:55] Nulgar: and re: Yrel - can be a Light-aligned antagonist and in their view villain to the Mag'har without being a full-on Light Nazi
[2:09:56] magisterofquelthalas: Purpose!!
[2:10:22] keyboardturner: arbiter's whole existing point was that the shadowlands was flawed and robotic an allowing souls to even go to the maw by default
[2:10:23] Syzmical: The arbiter wasnt a character she had no self awareness?
[2:10:31] alextheblight: Devos was wasted
[2:10:32] Nulgar: no, nononono NO
[2:10:34] Necoc: no Krexxus?
[2:10:36] Nulgar: Devos was NOT right
[2:10:41] alextheblight: a waste of potential, rather
[2:10:43] Nulgar: The Forsworn were NOT right
[2:10:47] cardrenn: maybe fusing with zovaal then showing that first look we had of the jailer
[2:10:52] i_identify_as_a_mistake: The best possible ending for BFA would be to imprison n'zoth in a Aquarium Cheer100 LUL
[2:10:54] ebrahim_91: Helya I need her
[2:11:03] REAPER_Replicator: it makes a statement
[2:11:03] bucephalos: my problem with devos was you could kill her before getting to that part of the kyrian campaign :(
[2:11:03] xd_pad: sometimes being right doesnt mean you wont get clapped
[2:11:08] jimbowheat: It was over too fast for Devos.
[2:11:11] Shanhayde: People aren't happy when there's no war, then people aren't happy when there's war
[2:11:23] keyboardturner: The forsworn were *initially* justified, but they extended into the point of terrorism and oppression and aligning with actual evil (much like the primalists)
[2:11:25] elbinn: Devos was an antagonist for a zone and she was the end boss of the zone dungeon. I felt like that was fine
[2:11:29] alextheblight: she was right, but went about the wrong way; like wayy wrong
[2:11:34] neverbornlucky: we horde need to go back to burning alliance zones
[2:11:36] Nulgar: they had one doubt, as got corrupted by it completely. We got explained again and again why giving up your memories (not getting them ripped out, GIVING THEM UP WILLINGLY) was a good thing.
[2:11:45] magemaster225: a lot of the zone threads would have benefitted from follower dungeons
[2:11:54] aurum2509: wow needs a baddie who has fun with it and enjoys themselves and isn’t super serious, they’re always so much more interesting and funny
[2:12:00] alextheblight: @keyboardturner also, forcefully turning other kyrian into Forsworn
[2:12:06] sm00kie2: idk I think she served her purpose
[2:12:09] Bradykin: I think the larger problem with devos was her being a prime example of the "evil character in the right, but doing evil so we don't need to properly explore their being in the right". They kinda explored it, but it feels like it got brushed aside. That's probably more about the archon then Devos though.
[2:12:17] jimbowheat: She was barely even a side character though. We killed her like a day after the expansion came out.
[2:12:27] Chlamydious: can we all agree Flynn Fairwind carried BFA
[2:12:30] SamuraiWillZ916: greymane has been a good side character
[2:12:42] alextheblight: Lysonia should have been the main bad guy for the forsworn
[2:12:51] jimbowheat: I just wanted more Devos.
[2:12:52] aurum2509: she kinda was
[2:13:04] SamuraiWillZ916: garrosh was done dirty
[2:13:06] bomayaa: I'm so glad I skipped Shadowlands
[2:13:07] DiscordianKitty: surely the options aren't a character that's well developed that dies and one that lives and becomes a main character
[2:13:23] alextheblight: well she was after Devos kicked the bucket. But from the get-go she should have been
[2:13:26] Syzmical: Calia is worst side character imo atm, seems very small amount of development
[2:13:26] MeggoArt: the problem with shadowlands is that they were introducing an ENTIRELY new cast and the community was trying to figure out who to latch onto as the main figures of the expac, turned out not to be the case with her (and arbiter and krexxal who were built up in the marketing)
[2:13:40] BlackRockWednesday: I kinda wish they just had Kel'thuzad as the big bad instead of the jailer
[2:13:53] alextheblight: also Krexxus got a 3d model
[2:14:08] jimbowheat: Just dont kill her.
[2:14:13] jimbowheat: Let Uther fix her
[2:14:17] Vamir77: did you find it odd that Devos’s story basically mirrored Arthas’s?
[2:14:45] Necoc: poor Ursoc they did him so bad and people don't remember
[2:15:01] Syzmical: they call it fractals in storytelling
[2:15:15] XxJagershotxX: I do agree to an extent tali, devos was more interesting than that guy who name I can’t even remember from the Maldraxxis campaign who got much more time to get be fleshed out but was just super uninteresting
[2:15:16] databob1: Look at Syndrax they took the time to tell us how good she was and then she Yeats herself into three fire rays so someone could tell alaxtraza that shit was going down
[2:15:24] alextheblight: not being killed
[2:15:25] aurum2509: I think it’s because she was portrayed with Uther so people assumed she must have been suuuuper important
[2:15:38] bomayaa: did people only want boring characters to be killed?
[2:15:50] DiscordianKitty: but, we have well-developed secondary characters who don't die, surely? (I don't have a horse in the race with Devos but I'm confused by the idea that a character that's well-developed that lives is inherently a main character?)
[2:16:01] alextheblight: she kickstarted the change for the kyrian's way of thinking
[2:16:01] CeasiusPls: she was too cool
[2:16:09] i_identify_as_a_mistake: Perhaps put Devos in one of the raids (possibly the end raid) and then put Uther in the 5 man dungeon. That would give her more time to shine. But i don't know just an idea.
[2:16:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin characters don't matter just give me that sweet loot
[2:16:11] menzlo: Just speaks to a dearth of interesting main characters that people want to elevate the well developed secondary chars
[2:16:30] grimblymcgoo: @i_identify_as_a_mistake You wanted to kill Uther instead of Devos?????
[2:16:31] Volkien: Devos should have been a raid boss
[2:16:43] frankenfoot5: Where did we end Shadowlands with the Kyrian again? Did they realize that mind erasure was bad?
[2:16:44] Jeanie130: Killing off characters we kill gives us the story weight. There's a reason why what our characters are doing matters.
[2:16:45] jimbowheat: Beating her to 1% health and keeping her alive as an option wouldn't have done any harm, would it?
[2:16:53] jockstrapgaymerboy: If only they'd given the Jailer the same amount of development 😂
[2:16:55] i_identify_as_a_mistake: @grimblymcgoo No we could just capture him
[2:16:59] alextheblight: that's not what I'm saying
[2:17:02] DiscordianKitty: Look, I'm still upset we killed Gul'dan, I'm not the one to ask
[2:17:03] Volkien: I liked her moral dilemna
[2:17:15] grimblymcgoo: @grimblymcgoo So then the same can be said about Devos
[2:17:16] REAPER_Replicator: save the turtle as a boss
[2:17:20] DiscordianKitty: I'm always on the side of all the baddies living
[2:17:32] CrossroadsDealer: people have a literary lack of understanding in how characters are developed. you make a skeleton that serves a narrative purpose, then you put their skin on.
[2:17:32] KeyouiX: a character can be a boss  of a dungeon and not die
[2:17:47] AngryInternetCat: Gul'dan is one of the original characters
[2:17:50] Bradykin: I think killing developed secondary characters is a problem IF it feels like we were promised more from that character's story. If it feels like a promise withdrawn. Devos did not feel that way.
[2:17:51] Vamir77: one of my biggest gripes with Shadowlands is the fact that Shadowmourne was ignored. So much promise for such a cool weapon
[2:17:57] byron_daniel: forspoken PogChamp
[2:17:57] XxJagershotxX: killing them off is fine, but killing them off or removing them too early I think is the issue, denathrius as well for example was taken out of the way too early for a really interesting character
[2:18:08] SamuraiWillZ916: thought they would have done more with Ner'zhul  than they did in WoD
[2:18:10] menzlo: People say put the war back in warcraft but then don't want to kill anyone
[2:18:12] MeggoArt: I think the animation threw people off because in BFA those 2.5D cinematics were used for major characters that were relevant throughout the expac, people came to it with the expectation that she would be more than she was.
[2:18:16] thunduz: The Magneto effect
[2:18:16] keyboardturner: Primalists
[2:18:17] i_identify_as_a_mistake: @grimblymcgoo True. Im not saying my idea was the perfect one, it was just a way for her to get some more time to shine
[2:18:19] byron_daniel: LUL
[2:18:32] vlaovich88: It is fun to kill baddies once in awhile. The escaped villian gets old if we never just kill someone
[2:18:36] byron_daniel: Defias Brotherhood LUL
[2:18:40] Harper_n7: so does the US
[2:18:43] Sockfire: What's for dinner?
[2:18:52] aurum2509: well 9/10 people who do bad things have what they think are good reasons for their actions, people don’t do things for no reason
[2:18:54] PidiaP: It’s the meme of Kilmonger, got to have him kill his girlfriend because he seems so logical compared to our capitalistic society
[2:19:06] PidiaP: The Primalists, not the Incarnates
[2:19:07] Volkien: My understanding was "nothing dies in shadowlands", everything get sent to the maw/become "concrete". Am I wrong @TaliesinAndEvitel ?
[2:19:12] jimbowheat: I'm even salty Razagath died, she was also great!
[2:19:15] DiscordianKitty: I think in the case of Devos the problem was the overall story of the Kyrian - where they end up changing their mind but only after killing people for the crime of calling them out for things they end up admitting was wrong
[2:19:32] byron_daniel: I get those mixed up all the time too LuL
[2:19:35] alextheblight: @Volkien if you die in the shadowlands your souls dies permanently
[2:19:35] Necoc: gave us night elf shamans though
[2:19:41] aurum2509: @jimbowheat yeah I wish she’d have lasted a little longer too
[2:19:52] theGLprime: every good villain needs henchmen
[2:20:17] jimbowheat: Would Fyrak and Razegath go to the Shadowl;ands?
[2:20:18] XxJagershotxX: to be totally honest, the bastion and the kyrian were just boring as a whole, so I think devos stood out as the only interesting kyrian
[2:20:54] elbinn: when do we talk to primalists in the dream? I remember the ones outside valdraken with Alexstrasza
[2:20:56] frankenfoot5: One thing that I wish WoW did a better job at was foreshadowing future threats building. I'm always so confused on where all these cultists on Azeroth come from
[2:21:08] alextheblight: yep
[2:21:19] Volkien: @alextheblight souls can't die. If there is an afterlife, then information can never be lost, the souls becomes dust and made into the materials we walk on in the shadowlands. Until they are infused with AP again.
[2:21:21] alextheblight: she interrupted the ascension event, whatever it was called
[2:21:28] astralumi: i don't remember if she killed kyrian
[2:21:31] jimbowheat: She did seem to go onto the Jailors side pretty fast!
[2:21:54] REAPER_Replicator: they wanted to kill the whole universe
[2:21:58] Vidaloo: No no that's right
[2:22:00] elbinn: What I never understood is she believed the Maw was evil, but then she quickly turned to join forces with the Maw?
[2:22:03] DiscordianKitty: I think I remember quite a sympathetic portrayal where she was more tricked, but I could be mixing her up as well
[2:22:18] aurum2509: @jimbowheat the incarnates probably go to their respective elemental planes when they die
[2:22:29] aurum2509: *plains
[2:22:34] alextheblight: she said something to the effect "the Jailer is the victim", so definitely tricked
[2:22:48] Nulgar: @frankenfoot5 no, they just let people keep their memories, but it didn't change much. Important positions were likely still required to give up their memories. Nothing hinted at a "oh, the Forsworn had a point" realisation and that's a good thing, because they were wrong.
[2:22:50] keyboardturner: i think Devos was against the Jailer but eventually turned to being allied and helped create the Mawsworn
[2:22:51] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien Souls can die. The anima drought in Ardenweld literally showed this in one of the cinematics
[2:23:00] jimbowheat: @aurum2509 so Fyrakk is off chilling with Ragnaros somewhere. I like that.
[2:23:01] alextheblight: Lysonia was pretty on-board with "kill everything"
[2:23:03] astralumi: a REDEMPTIOIN for Garrosh? seriously??
[2:23:05] DR0G0TH: Garrosh went out how he lived, his way
[2:23:13] jimbowheat: Garrosh cinematic was perfect1
[2:23:16] alextheblight: it was. He went out like a boss
[2:23:19] Nulgar: Garrosh - always disliked him, but that cinematic was when he became a true Horde leader
[2:23:20] magisterofquelthalas: That cinematic was good
[2:23:28] grimblymcgoo: So we either permanently kill garrosh and no cinematic, or one from an intern. Ill take the intern one
[2:23:29] Syzmical: I remember vividly there was a youtube video doing a makeover of that cinematic that smashed
[2:23:31] DR0G0TH: It was poorly made but thematically good
[2:23:33] thunduz: ha they used uno reverse card, its bad now
[2:23:38] elbinn: It was good. It didnt change his character, didn't change past story, made him still true to himself
[2:23:41] Nulgar: they say "intern made" but mean "ingame graphics"
[2:23:42] Vamir77: What do you think of a TBC Season of Discovery? You could go wild and have Demon Hunters
[2:23:48] Volkien: @grimblymcgoo no, the anima drought was brought on by the constant lost of anima and the low replenishments of it. NOT because souls "died".
[2:23:49] i_identify_as_a_mistake: Devos got in to one argument with upper management and then decided the murder was the way to go LUL
[2:23:51] zeckzeckzeck: I mean, they posted on a reddit for Asmongold...not surprised they're not someone we'd agree with :)
[2:23:55] aurum2509: this post is a joke it’s got to be
[2:23:59] Biffiee: The story itself was good, but the cinematic was remade by a fan to be 10x better
[2:24:09] magisterofquelthalas: It was a bit poorly made technically but it wasnt "intern made" levels of bad
[2:24:09] DiscordianKitty: I get that it's going to happen with dungeons and raids, but I do get annoyed by senseless deaths when they haven't even tried to come up with a good reason - like Nymue etc in Amirdrassil
[2:24:19] alextheblight: ngl, the Kel'thuzad stuff was bullshit
[2:24:22] magisterofquelthalas: Kel'thuzad was handled badly.
[2:24:24] Nulgar: well that's offensive - to me. I weakened that boy.
[2:24:25] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien They literally had to choose to let Ursoc die because they had no anima to infuse in him
[2:24:50] Chlamydious: anduin has had one of the hardest lives in wow tbf, and its shown in the WW cinematic hes still suffering from the effects of the jailer
[2:24:57] shabobado: they should have given baine a chair in oribos
[2:24:59] byron_daniel: well tbf his death cinematic implies we barely scratched him
[2:25:04] LilStinker: thats what happens when you dont play the game, and only watch WoW youtubers to get mad
[2:25:04] Vamir77: Any single adventurer should have aced Nathanos easy
[2:25:06] i_identify_as_a_mistake: 50? try half the server ^^
[2:25:07] alextheblight: also didn't like how he sounded like Skeletor when he didn't sound like that before (I like to think it was part of the act, though)
[2:25:13] magisterofquelthalas: Yeah also that was Tyrande? U know? She is not a weak character and she was enhanced
[2:25:19] Nulgar: Corgo100 pretty clear to me this person has only ever "experienced" the SL story as disjointed clips
[2:25:52] TankenFunk: Good for Pelagos, tbh
[2:25:54] Volkien: @grimblymcgoo they never said they let him die. they let him "wither", drained. Battery comes in, battery gets drained, empty battery is still lying around, we walk on "dead" batteries.
[2:25:54] TankenFunk: what a chad
[2:26:01] rowanoaken: They're just stating facts there with no opinion lol
[2:26:04] Bradykin: he made that sound better then the story of pelagos actually was
[2:26:09] Bradykin: lol
[2:26:19] byron_daniel: I think there's a gameplay and cinematic narrative clash, we beat nathanos to 1% but the cinematic implies we're barely scratching him @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:26:29] Nulgar: ARTHAS WASN'T IN SHADOWLANDS. IT WAS JUST A FUCKING SLIVER OF HIS SOUL, BASICALLY A SINGLE FINGER BONE.
[2:26:30] alextheblight: oh wow, he's running with the "Mal'Ganis was X characters all along" thing
[2:26:40] Chlamydious: Tesco self check out dealing with souls for the after life
[2:26:53] eball1984: eball1984 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[2:27:10] Syzmical: Arthas was actually controling the jailor
[2:27:11] AssumptionPrime: I’ll give this dude one point for not bringing up Pelagos being trans as a negative against his character, more than I expected
[2:27:21] blumberquack: ...what LUL
[2:27:34] Nulgar: Sylvanas didn't even berate him
[2:27:49] jimbowheat: "least connected" ? What?
[2:27:50] Vamir77: @taliesinandevitel I still have a hard time believing that they got rid of The Maw. millions of years bad guys have been going in the maw, and sudden you just don’t need it anymore?
[2:27:50] TankenFunk: @Nulgar Yeah, his story ended in Wrath. His story in SL is a memoir. An afterthought. As it should be tneEvi
[2:27:56] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien "Wither"  -he disolved into dust. Thats not a battery
[2:27:58] X_barley: Would be real funny if you dropped your jailer explanation video in the comments, see how this fucker likes the idea of flipping a coin for eternity
[2:28:01] byron_daniel: most people don't even know Pelagos is trans
[2:28:07] alextheblight: I didn't mind the 35 anima thing, honestly. Added to the tragedy of his story
[2:28:08] seanstrachan: I m constantly perplexed when people say she berates him
[2:28:09] Chlamydious: sylvanas has quite the connection with arthas does she not?
[2:28:11] hellfiremetal: in the room w/ Jaina and Anduin?
[2:28:13] magisterofquelthalas: I wouldnt call it least connected but his end was...unsatisfying i agree
[2:28:13] DiscordianKitty: I liked the arthas bit in shadowlands
[2:28:23] REAPER_Replicator: i think she was one of the most conected because she was one of hhis friends befor she got killed
[2:28:24] aurum2509: Pelagos is trans what when did this happen
[2:28:26] hellfiremetal: Jaina was GF and Anduin was possessed by him?
[2:28:29] HSAyril: That wasn't my issue with Pelagos. He couldn't even get past his own self-doubt and now he's supposed to judge everyone's souls. I thought Uther was gonna be made into the Arbitor
[2:28:30] keyboardturner: oh no the DREADLORDS SHAPESHIFT CONTROVERSY
[2:28:37] alextheblight: it was more like "well them's the breaks. See you"
[2:28:45] bucephalos: A lot of people hoped he would get the same treatment Illidan got in Legion
[2:28:52] byron_daniel: @aurum2509 its kinda that, he died as a woman, but is a man in the shadowlands
[2:28:52] northshanks: @aurum2509 It happened quite early in SL. And it shouldn't matter that much.
[2:28:56] daikaiju73: Regarding Arthas, same. Let it be finished. Cheer100
[2:28:59] Nulgar: @TankenFunk same as his connection to Jaina, even Uther got over the trauma he had from Arthas a good while before this cinematic
[2:29:04] jimbowheat: After Uther yeeted him into the Maw in the Afterlives cinematic, I was sure he'd be a main character of the expansion
[2:29:07] alextheblight: Kael'thas was handled pretty well in SL
[2:29:08] X_barley: I NEVER EVER wanted Arthas to find peace or get redeemed, I liked that his ending was as bitter as his life
[2:29:12] i_identify_as_a_mistake: Let's just agree that the worst sin in warcraft history is what they did to the Crown of Domination...
[2:29:20] blumberquack: Nah I agree, I was hoping they'd just let him go and they did :p
[2:29:24] Volkien: @grimblymcgoo the shadowlands version of "dead battery" is a soul turned to dust. "water" the soul. infuse it with "AP". boom -arthas- Ursoc is back
[2:29:29] alextheblight: LUL
[2:29:32] Vamir77: They did the maw dirty shutting it down
[2:29:37] alextheblight: BK crown
[2:29:42] somniorum: It's very encouraging to see a bunch of people actually saying they really *liked* that bit.  I strongly agree.
[2:29:45] DiscordianKitty: the best thing they did was the primus being the jailer
[2:29:47] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien Head cannon isnt how the lore works
[2:29:47] Vamir77: That’s like God saying “Eh ima get rid of Hell”
[2:29:52] theDirtyon3: they fucked Bolvar over
[2:30:01] alextheblight: Denathrius and the dreadlords worked really well with old lore
[2:30:02] AssumptionPrime: I won’t speak positively on SL for most things, but having Arthas not actually appear was maybe the best choice they could make with him
[2:30:05] zeckzeckzeck: Thrall
[2:30:06] byron_daniel: Bolvar is genuinely a shell of a character in SL
[2:30:06] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien The cinematic he blows away as dust. theres nothing to gather or water
[2:30:06] DiscordianKitty: god you do not want to be on the cover art of a wow expansion
[2:30:07] X_barley: Do we know what Bolvars up to these days?
[2:30:10] McScooterson: rip Drust storyline
[2:30:14] magisterofquelthalas: Poor man, but again we never seemed to disgree in wow community whether or if yes how much of it he is responsible.
[2:30:15] theDirtyon3: Baine KEKW
[2:30:20] thunduz: Baine continues to cry in the corner being ignored
[2:30:24] skeletonetiquette: Hey the Soul Forge was cool man, that was a legit good idea
[2:30:29] byron_daniel: I would've hated if Arthas or Garrosh had gotten more screen time, let them rest
[2:30:34] DiscordianKitty: anduin, alleria, and thrall about to get some bad writing if alex in dragonflight and bolvar in shadowlands is anything to go by
[2:30:37] seanstrachan: Any story at all for the knights of the ebon blade would've been great lol
[2:30:38] astralumi: of course. what a surprise
[2:30:40] Volkien: @grimblymcgoo the Jailer says, once they took every last ounce of AP from a souls, the souls become the ground of the MAW.
[2:30:46] AssumptionPrime: Ah THERE it is!
[2:30:51] mattzomix: i hoped for a redemption arc for arthas and sylvanas, but i'm fine with it now
[2:30:51] byron_daniel: witcher fan is anti woke LUL
[2:30:52] Vamir77: I wish they touched on Shadowmourne in SL
[2:30:53] neverbornlucky: Taliesin noo it was  a missed episode between Jaine and Arthus on the shadowlands. I wanted to see Arthus have sex with Jaine and make a baby
[2:30:54] TankenFunk: I didn't want to read that, Tali tneEvi
[2:30:57] keyboardturner: Personally I feel like Arthas returning would have been the fan service you think you want but you actually don't
[2:30:58] thunduz: didn't take long did it?
[2:31:00] HSAyril: Should have been Uther
[2:31:04] grimblymcgoo: @Volkien The jailer did not say this
[2:31:07] alextheblight: oh yeah....
[2:31:09] REAPER_Replicator: at lease they are not disney
[2:31:09] CrossroadsDealer: “woke” unironically
[2:31:12] keyboardturner: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:31:13] alextheblight: twitteroth
[2:31:18] i_identify_as_a_mistake: The one who got dicked the worst was Baine. I can't even remember what he did other then sit on his ass.
[2:31:19] zeckzeckzeck: maybe that comment is sad that blizz didn't do more!....but nah, it's probably hate
[2:31:19] DiscordianKitty: the sanest part of twitter
[2:31:21] X_barley: tneObviously
[2:31:21] alextheblight: YEP
[2:31:23] blumberquack: All I'll say is that Pelagos looked like a dweeb as the Arbiter, that's my gripe with that whole thing LUL
[2:31:24] Disjoint_Dwarf: I love the IDEA of shadowlands - the framework is there and...decent? - but execution was just... bad
[2:31:25] Nulgar: and this is why I can never trust Asmon, because this comment is eponymous with his viewerbase
[2:31:27] byron_daniel: is that just not most of twitter?
[2:31:27] DiscordianKitty: most hinged group
[2:31:30] rws26: Arbiter should have been the Covenant arbiter from Halo, that's what I always said, to really embody the spirit of the upcoming merger.
[2:31:34] keyboardturner: i have no idea what you're talking about @TaliesinAndEvitel Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:31:34] McScooterson: dot dot dot
[2:31:34] rowanoaken: rowanoaken subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! brb - making a go fund me for Talie's roof
[2:31:35] menzlo: Woke is when a single character is non white/hetero/cis
[2:31:37] byron_daniel: looooool
[2:31:41] astralumi: what...
[2:31:41] neverbornlucky: Taliesin didn't you want to see Arthus and Jaine have one last moment of sex in shadowlands ?
[2:31:49] alextheblight: leftist version of asmongold's fanbase
[2:31:54] byron_daniel: ngl WoW twitter is mostly unhinged
[2:31:59] RileyDoodles_: also why is that transphobic lmao?
[2:32:00] Nulgar: oh this was so fucking disingenous, no one complaining about that actually gave a fuck about trans rights
[2:32:05] RileyDoodles_: we dont claim these people
[2:32:06] Harper_n7: maybe they did chop it off
[2:32:07] AssumptionPrime: wait, hold on, that would be funny though
[2:32:08] bucephalos: They are Souls in Maldraxxus you can even choose what race you want to be!
[2:32:11] Vamir77: The message and the Media don’t mix.
[2:32:14] astralumi: @Nulgar exactly
[2:32:19] keyboardturner: The best part is I datamined and disproved what they were saying but they ignored me and in fact used my own out of context datamining to try to prove their point (and then tried to misgender me)
[2:32:22] sm00kie2: nah he’s gonna become a robot
[2:32:26] redcrimtane: That could just be bad faith actors, no?
[2:32:37] rws26: Was pretty likely it was going to be Pelagos all expansion, pretty foreshadowed.
[2:32:38] Bradykin: i'd honestly forgotten pelagos was trans. I don't recall this debate at the time, but I didn't use twitter - which I probably should get back to not using
[2:32:50] thunduz: the worse thing about shadowlands is the I never got to make a playable kyurian
[2:32:52] X_barley: I’ve seen a lot of people on that corner of WoW twit call devs racist over very innocuous story beats
[2:32:53] RileyDoodles_: devils advocate take: trans people are primed to see bad shit in the media cause its mostly bad all the time lmao
[2:32:55] thunduz: worst*
[2:32:56] Syzmical: I'm so glad i don't pay attention to this controversy, people  sound like idiots on both sides
[2:32:58] byron_daniel: do you mean bad faith actors or psyops?
[2:33:02] AssumptionPrime: “Charles, you can finally take the throne, on ONE condition”
[2:33:12] nyrhalahotep: Transphobia is pathetic and weakminded, Trans folks are some of the most clever, empathetic, kind and humerous people I've ever met; those who hate them ALWAYS turn out to be the worst of humanity.
[2:33:14] skeletonetiquette: That was probably the best version of Trans being in media it was the truest and most genuine way to show what is inside of the individual
[2:33:17] alextheblight: flailing over nothing
[2:33:24] keyboardturner: isn't psyops like.. government shit
[2:33:32] byron_daniel: yeah I agree, people overestimate psyops
[2:33:39] neverbornlucky: King Charles has cancer can we be nice to him
[2:33:40] thunduz: psyops was a great game on the PS2
[2:33:43] shabobado: if pelagos was such a good arbiter, why didn’t he have the good sense to get baine a chair
[2:33:45] Mewsette_kitty: I don’t know why I did not like shadowlands I just assumed I was burned out on wow and just need a break
[2:33:48] menzlo: Trans people are just people. They can be cool or shit
[2:33:49] RileyDoodles_: trans equality lads, some of us are stupid
[2:34:04] databob1: My only problem with paligos was I didn't like how the voice actor read the lines
[2:34:10] nyrhalahotep: Exactly, well daid
[2:34:11] alextheblight: Nyarlathotep said trans rights PrideTrans
[2:34:14] nyrhalahotep: said*
[2:34:14] byron_daniel: @keyboardturner I think people use it as "people pretending to be the other side" or maybe thats false flags, idk
[2:34:16] Harai_Ulfsark: some are just innocent man (or woman)
[2:34:25] RileyDoodles_: or enby
[2:34:42] RileyDoodles_: trueee
[2:34:50] alextheblight: true
[2:34:52] ophypanda: @neverbornlucky for real right? People can disagree with him on his beliefs, but he is fighting cancer. Unless somebody has had it, then they shouldn't say shit about it. I personally have fought and won 3 times since 2017. Rock on and F Cancer!
[2:34:52] Sharktribe: my younger sibling is trans, they're insanely chill
[2:34:58] RileyDoodles_: trans people put up with that stuff every day
[2:34:59] keyboardturner: i've seen trans right wingers / nazis before, and plenty of white LGBTQ+ people who are super racist, and so on
[2:35:11] rowanoaken: Yeah it's crazy how people treat trans people as a monolith - but that's the story of society - people refuse to treat others with any dignity because they're different
[2:35:31] skeletonetiquette: Pelagos and Chromie are probably the most natural example of Trans characters for WoW the idea it's forced is just bullshit
[2:35:36] alextheblight: pretty much, yehj
[2:35:38] alextheblight: yeh*
[2:35:43] allisonjane78: I’m trans and the amount of times I just let it go when people misgender me is crazy. it honestly hurts me inside but like you said , I understand when people just do it by accident.
[2:35:54] RileyDoodles_: TransgenderPride TransgenderPride TransgenderPride
[2:36:04] alextheblight: TransgenderPride TransgenderPride PrideTrans PrideTrans TransgenderPride TransgenderPride
[2:36:16] Lausten: Anyone can get hysterical when attacked  by a cis man, like they are in most videos where we see a hysterical trans person..
[2:36:17] Volkien: @grimblymcgoo The Maw's ground is formed from souls pounded into dust. With enough souls passing through Gorgoa, the Maw can be expanded.[30]
[2:36:30] zeckzeckzeck: Intolerance is awful. Except towards the Dutch
[2:36:38] Syzmical: Imagine ever caring or wondering whats between somebodys legs holy.
[2:36:45] keyboardturner: Kappa is anyone surprised it came from this subreddit
[2:36:49] Engram08: @zeckzeckzeck excuse me
[2:36:49] TankenFunk: TransgenderPride
[2:36:51] rowanoaken: Went into Shadowlands thinking Pelagos was a hot dude, came out of it thinking the same - I love that man
[2:36:57] theszoti: what a sad miserable existence r/asmongold posters must have
[2:37:01] RileyDoodles_: we can always tell
[2:37:10] nyrhalahotep: What people don't understand is that if they agree with taking rights from others, they will one day be the "other."
[2:37:21] zeckzeckzeck: @Engram08 old Austin Powers joke, paraphrased
[2:37:24] keyboardturner: the guy who said i had mental illness for correctly identifying when he was comparing LGBTQ+ people as "mental illness"
[2:37:29] Syzmical: People opinionated on this topic either way have mental mold, go exercise
[2:37:50] RileyDoodles_: @nyrhalahotep its the poem, first they came for the communists
[2:37:51] AssumptionPrime: I just don’t have the energy to make a deal out of every time someone misgenders me. it shouldn’t happen, but goddamn, there’s only so much time in the day.
[2:38:04] nyrhalahotep: “First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out, Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out, Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out, Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.” ― Martin Niemöller
[2:38:07] spenseb: @RileyDoodles_  haHAA
[2:38:08] TankenFunk: Met enough people in my life who will misgender me on purpose to recognize when someone does it by mistake, we can both go on with our days and it's okay tneEvi
[2:38:10] byron_daniel: asmongold's community is a cesspool, it's a shame what he has become now, a few years ago he looked like he was going on a good direction
[2:38:11] menzlo: It's such a non issue
[2:38:17] rowanoaken: Yeah no one handles anything with any nuance
[2:38:22] theszoti: these people didn't give a fuck about sports and equal healthcare before trans people came in the picture, it's just an excuse to hate on them
[2:38:33] theDirtyon3: the easy thing to do here i think we can all agree on is just calling everyone a dude or dudet :)
[2:38:42] TheDutchGlaswegian: Can we go back talking about WoW?
[2:38:58] keyboardturner: todd howard is laughing now
[2:39:00] ourmanyfans: They throw a fit when a trans man competes with other men, the "unfair advantage" stuff is just bollocks
[2:39:02] RileyDoodles_: nah tali is pure trans rights streamer now :')
[2:39:03] sm00kie2: the bad thing is now there are people calling out cis females who are just good at their sport declaring incorrectly the athlete must be trans.
[2:39:03] byron_daniel: how are they blaming legion stuff on Danuser lol
[2:39:03] keyboardturner: buy skyrim
[2:39:05] aeson_of_raid_sock: 2 year old post or 2 year old poster?
[2:39:05] xd_pad: people who dont otherwise care about "farness in sports" will claim their transphobia is about "fairness in sports"
[2:39:06] Mewsette_kitty: @thedutchglaswegian 🙀
[2:39:06] TankenFunk: I haven't been laughing all stream tneTaliCry
[2:39:09] rowanoaken: You are right with the trans people in sports phenomenon - really well documented - right wing pundits switched between issues extensively before they latched onto sports
[2:39:12] Bradykin: I feel like most people who think there's a conversation to be had about sport in good faith, just also don't think it's that high on the priority list, so they don't bring it up that much. I think there's a convo to be had there, but I also just don't care about to have that convo, and care more about other issues like healthcare access.
[2:39:24] rws26: Still not sure why everyone hates(hated?) Danuser so much, was thing a thing the whole time, feels like it's a recently made-up sort of need to produce reaction content.
[2:39:36] somniorum: Wait, a new book was announced?
[2:39:36] alextheblight: @byron_daniel he's the current scapegoat
[2:39:37] keyboardturner: i think general sentiment i saw so far was gazlowe and alleria good, thrall/anduin bad
[2:39:45] Silencbank: short story book?
[2:40:02] rowanoaken: Oh yeah we do live on terf island :(
[2:40:14] RileyDoodles_: RileyDoodles_ is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[2:40:14] RileyDoodles_: RileyDoodles_ gifted a Tier 1 sub to Tenga66! 
[2:40:24] Tenga66: @RileyDoodles_ Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:40:30] RileyDoodles_: Thankyou for being a good trans ali tali <3
[2:40:31] byron_daniel: do you think the story under metzen has more of a chance of being good or it's about the same? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:40:53] keyboardturner: I remember when Metzen also got a ton of shit back in Cata/MoP/WoD
[2:40:59] seanstrachan: Tbh disappointed there isn't a Moira and Dagran short story in there
[2:40:59] Sharktribe: Seeing the meme-brain comments here and there about Danuser made me lose hope in humanity
[2:41:18] alextheblight: people shit on the story when Metzen was at the reins, so nothing's gonna change
[2:41:20] byron_daniel: Your point in the weekly reset was perfect, "the buck stops with him", maybe he isn't to blame, but he IS responsible.
[2:41:25] ebrahim_91: Tali to my understanding there are 2 more stories that have yet to be revealed yes? If so wont it be cool to get a Sylvanas's Maw journey as one then she hears the voice / joins the fight.
[2:41:35] nekokanbaru: I just want Sylvanas to come back :(
[2:41:44] alextheblight: held the reins, rather*
[2:41:51] mattzomix: remember, when metzen retconned the draenai lore? that were times
[2:42:25] magisterofquelthalas: Ofc, he didnt have Metzen levels of authority
[2:42:26] byron_daniel: isn't creative director the role Afrasiabi had? Danuser had that role when he left
[2:42:35] byron_daniel: or I mean narrative director
[2:42:48] magisterofquelthalas: But again Metzen made Warcraft so
[2:43:06] keyboardturner: down with totalitarianism, promote democracy OSFrog
[2:43:24] byron_daniel: I understand what you mean, but then is he not accountable for any of his work?
[2:44:10] robotmansa: "We want to sell Warcraft 3 again - put a bunch of warcraft 3 stuff into the expansion"
[2:44:12] Sharktribe: I'm still sad warfronts didn't get to be fully fulfilled. I hope they take another swing at it someday
[2:44:40] Onida2189: Reading the book War of the Scaleborn in addition with what I already know about Neltharion, I just wanted to ask....How come Neltharion was influenced by Old Golds whereas Iridikron who was also very closely attuned to the Earth (as in underground as well) was not. Can there be a subtle connection between Order Magic and the Void or is it simply vengenance from the part of the OGs because the titanforged imprisoned them?
[2:44:46] alextheblight: @Sharktribe bfa classic, guaranteed
[2:44:49] LilStinker: i always figured all the Warcraft3 talk was marketing team pushing the topic
[2:45:09] thunduz: ooooo yeah
[2:45:17] thunduz: didn't work out well
[2:45:22] holyzeke: do you think he got pushed out because the SL backlash?
[2:45:23] Syzmical: zeriths are so convoluted
[2:45:48] seanstrachan: I bang my head off the wall when someone still refers to Elune as a robot
[2:46:16] mosart: Feels kind of similar to WoD matching the wow movie release
[2:46:32] keyboardturner: I wish people tried out Dragonflight more genuinely, it's so much more improved. Some of my friends who haven't played for a long while came back to try it and enjoyed it
[2:46:35] byron_daniel: Bellular alluded to a Metzen and Danuser clash after Metzen rejoined Blizzard, do you know anything about that?
[2:46:48] AlfTheDog: dragonflight story had such potential :/
[2:46:58] AssumptionPrime: Activision/Blizz have a habit of letting someone be the fall guy for decisions/mistakes made as a company/team
[2:47:01] keyboardturner: @byron_daniel i've been told the opposite personally
[2:47:01] Syzmical: they fist fought in the parking lot
[2:47:12] Syzmical: chris called sylv ugly
[2:47:15] Frozen_DK: just tuned in, did steve denuser get fired ?
[2:47:32] magisterofquelthalas: Only he said it so far, his sourves might be faulty
[2:47:33] Onida2189: I have a feeling there was a significant lack of communication between Steve Danuser and his predecessors regarding the WoW storyline progress which maybe kind of made him clueless as far as maintaining continuity was concerned?
[2:47:48] AssumptionPrime: Like, all the lawsuit stuff dropped and then Brack was out despite it obviously being an institutional problem
[2:48:39] byron_daniel: @byron_daniel tbf Bellular implied some clash with Danuser inside Blizzard and most people assumed it was with Metzen, but maybe it's other leadership
[2:48:46] Lausten: What have this guy done with my story? - Christ Metzen 2023 Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:48:49] magisterofquelthalas: Chris doesnt seem like a guy that is bullish
[2:49:08] jimbowheat: Will that Gun in Azshara ever be fired? That was him, right?
[2:49:14] magisterofquelthalas: Afrasiabi seems to be though
[2:49:36] Tibainium: I’ve heard Chris was a tough one to work with in ‘old’ Blizzard
[2:49:58] chryseis: How did Afrasiabi get away with all that?
[2:50:06] nadiaaa: ohh but he had never KNOWN afrasiabi according to his own tweet
[2:50:12] magisterofquelthalas: If someone walks around the workplace drunk, that person is probably mentally ill
[2:50:14] Onida2189: For example the burning of teldrassil? Apparently that was solely Afrosiabi's idea and his entire team was not agreeable to it.
[2:50:30] byron_daniel: bruh
[2:50:33] keyboardturner: NotLikeThis
[2:50:35] AlfredK: When/where did he say that?
[2:50:38] rowanoaken: Jesus wow
[2:50:45] Syzmical: Professionally knowing eachother is what id describe as barely knowing the private Alex
[2:50:47] bomayaa: Ed Balls
[2:50:48] byron_daniel: thats genuinely hilarious
[2:50:54] Demeternoth: PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn
[2:50:58] zeckzeckzeck: that's amazing
[2:51:10] Alannalouwho: thats kinda why i dont trust him
[2:51:11] JusticeDraws: anyone got a screenshot of that
[2:51:24] HSAyril: Excuse me, this is a Metzen criticism-free zone, thank you
[2:51:43] diezel_bee: LUL
[2:51:46] blumberquack: LUL
[2:51:46] JusticeDraws: LOL WHAT
[2:51:49] byron_daniel: LUL I'm dying
[2:51:54] byron_daniel: senior citizen moment
[2:51:57] TankenFunk: Unlucky
[2:51:59] Sorin__: he's a pokemon
[2:52:00] keyboardturner: i can't necessarily fault him for it, he struggles with anxiety and probably would check if somebody said anything good or bad
[2:52:01] zeckzeckzeck: Just a boomer signing their tweet, nothing to see here
[2:52:03] AlfredK: When did he say he didn't know him? Also a tweet?
[2:52:05] nadiaaa: i remember this lmaoooooo OOF
[2:52:41] JusticeDraws: I think we would all do something like that in a panic
[2:52:46] Syzmical: rather be embarrased than indicted
[2:52:58] bomayaa: "yeah what's up with that Alex?"
[2:52:59] rowanoaken: I get it because it's good to know the temperature of the room before you make a statement? But still hilarious
[2:53:02] Jeanie130: If it's good enough for St. Peter - it's good enough for Metzen.
[2:53:03] allstarkeung: He didn't deny knowing him, just denied having a close relationship with him
[2:53:20] thunduz: just jam sessions
[2:53:24] ophypanda: Would you not be concerned your name was out there? I mean this was a HUGE scandal. I am sure before they allowed him back in the game that he was researched and investigated throughly.
[2:53:36] Alannalouwho: yeah the denying knowing afrasiabi is what gets me
[2:53:43] zachwho: doubt he didnt know
[2:53:45] Onida2189: If you remember during the Blizzcon that announced BfA, Chris Metzen (who was not with Blizzard anymore at the time) became one of the "fans" asking question in the Q&A session regarding the return of Thrall? I kind of sensed subtle tensions between Alex and Chris that moment
[2:53:50] Onida2189: See it for yourself
[2:53:53] keyboardturner: NotLikeThis
[2:53:53] Syzmical: is there evidence they were close privately and personally?
[2:53:55] diezel_bee: forgot about that guy lol
[2:54:06] nadiaaa: he said afrasiabi was a hardass and that they only smoked together or something along those lines LUL i have that tweet imprinted on the back of my eyelids
[2:54:06] molecular6167: Why do you stream at 50hz?
[2:54:07] AlfredK: Working with him closely doesn't mean you're close with someone outside of work
[2:54:25] PressHeart_: :O
[2:54:27] byron_daniel: whaaat
[2:54:30] zachwho: LUL
[2:54:32] keyboardturner: isn't that UK standard for tv and stuff too
[2:54:37] PressHeart_: why are you being scammed out of 10 frames
[2:54:38] molecular6167: I didn't release PAL and NTSC was still relevant.
[2:54:39] TheDeekins: we must invade europe at once
[2:54:47] rowanoaken: Oh yeah it's because of the electricity frequency - I think? I think I saw it in a Tom Scott video?
[2:54:50] Co1eCash: He obviously never watched Harrison Ford give advice to the president in Clear and Present Danger
[2:54:52] allstarkeung: 23.999
[2:54:56] keyboardturner: LuL SCAMMED
[2:55:00] byron_daniel: its the big 50 fps industry
[2:55:10] byron_daniel: they're out to get ya
[2:55:11] TheDeekins: they give the 10 lost frames to the Crown smh
[2:55:18] allstarkeung: uk tv standard is 25 fps
[2:55:24] FezPanda: I was told brexit would save us from the 25-50 tyranny
[2:55:27] keyboardturner: monarchy tax
[2:55:28] molecular6167: Most people are watching on 60hz monitors or 120hz.
[2:55:54] holyzeke: Talie u do realize that the us is the uk except we fixed all the bits you guys got wrong lol
[2:55:56] Graffis101: its a bit weird if its less then 24, films were shown in 24 before digital
[2:56:03] Blloood: Why is chris metzen just writing cheis metzen?
[2:56:12] Blloood: or is he being @ at?
[2:56:21] Theorof: It's because of the frequency of the power grid
[2:56:30] Blloood: idk man, says 41 Sec ago Kappa
[2:56:35] Syzmical: @Blloood he was lurking tweets  and had a boomer moment
[2:56:38] allstarkeung: so you're a little suspicious of him basically
[2:56:39] keyboardturner: have you heard the podcast with Pirate Software / The Prime Time @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:57:10] Blloood: How can we trust chris to take us into the world soul saga when he cant even navigate twitter
[2:57:10] byron_daniel: it's pretty obvious that whoever was in charge of the story would be thrown to the side if Metzen came back
[2:57:21] yorden: Thrall is going to turn to the player character at some point in TWW and say "Thrall."
[2:57:37] Onida2189: I think it's awkward to have two top management officials at the same department, basic HR :D
[2:57:39] molecular6167: I think it comes down to creative control differences.
[2:57:51] Graffis101: they were lovers!
[2:57:57] FezPanda: The source is Metzen
[2:58:15] alextheblight: I have a screenshot of that tweet too lol
[2:58:25] dwolf010: danuser himself said it was partly becouse of RTO
[2:58:30] molecular6167: Didn't Danuser have the highest level of creative control on Dragonflight?
[2:58:55] allstarkeung: Only story stuff right?
[2:58:59] molecular6167: Who would have a higher level of control then when Afraisaibi left?
[2:59:01] Labott: My favorite video of Steve Danuser was the Zereth Mortis reveal. He seemed to speak so pationately
[2:59:04] somniorum: People seem to talk about Danuser as if he were some dictator, but I've always got the impression that he was fairly... hands off with his team?  Let people do a lot of what the wished.
[2:59:05] Goodnevi1: Dude self inserts as a "simp" yet wanted to take over control... doesn't make sense
[2:59:06] thunduz: people understand Danuser has a boss right?
[2:59:10] thunduz: had*
[2:59:22] yorden: Danuser just wanted his sylvanas waifu, I can't fault him on getting to act on his dreams
[2:59:38] Blloood: Feel like both taliesen and chat have no idea what they are talking about and throwing "probeblies" at eachother
[2:59:39] molecular6167: So who had creative control then?
[2:59:46] Vaephera: Yeah, the PCGamer articles mentions RTO, Danuser is in Missouri now. It didn't confirm it as the main reason, but if he decided not to return in the summer the timeline seems to fit with leaving in November
[2:59:48] chryseis: How did he have that much power??
[2:59:59] erdls: so they knew from day1 danuser wasnt fit enough to make the big decisions
[3:00:09] keyboardturner: i accidentally closed the stream and now i got prerolls NotLikeThis
[3:00:12] magisterofquelthalas: Chat too btw
[3:00:13] molecular6167: If the position was vacant. Who had creative control then?
[3:00:20] magisterofquelthalas: SMADGE
[3:00:24] Gh0stBadger: ew asmond lol
[3:00:33] Harai_Ulfsark: @chryseis afrasiabi was one of the original blizz members thats why
[3:00:34] molecular6167: Director
[3:00:36] Mopmopmopmop: producer
[3:00:40] TheDeekins: I've noticed Danuser gets all of the blame for the big story beats he likely wrote by management edict, whereas he gets no credit for the smaller story beats that he alone authored and spearheaded.  Funny thing, that
[3:00:41] TownieTV: everything on the internet is fact
[3:00:42] PidiaP: Producers
[3:00:42] zeckzeckzeck: producers
[3:00:43] Mopmopmopmop: best movie is producer
[3:00:44] Blloood: The viewers
[3:00:44] byron_daniel: production company?
[3:00:46] Onida2189: Well, Sylvanas villain ark was possible, but the way it would have been executed didn't quite materialize in lore. In fact, they destroyed it.
[3:00:46] Engram08: the individual or entity who owns the rights
[3:00:49] nyrhalahotep: alternative facts are just lies told by fools. 😂
[3:00:51] molecular6167: Executive producer?
[3:00:57] boomshroom: because they pay
[3:00:57] MrScotticus: MrScotticus gifted a Tier 1 sub to keyboardturner! They have given 251 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:01:08] molecular6167: Ah so is it the director who usually makes the speech.
[3:01:09] boomshroom: production company owns it
[3:01:09] dday_movies: producers
[3:01:20] rowanoaken: My head is bursting with all of this knowledge
[3:01:34] TheDeekins: @TaliesinAndEvitel this is very similar to writers in the comic book space: current Amazing Spider-Man gets a ton of hate from fans, and so does its author, Zeb Wells, who has a history of great writing.
[3:01:35] PidiaP: So what you are saying is blame Holly? Kappa
[3:01:37] Gh0stBadger: enjoy your dinner
