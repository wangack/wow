[4:09:27] DansAtk: @Jibowo there's a program you can download to get them working, but you'd need to buy dongles and base stations too
[4:09:30] Valyri4nSteel: finally a good twitch rivals going on FeelsStrongMan
[4:09:32] TheYishai: @Jibowo but you can connect a vive base station to an oculus and then use fully body
[4:09:35] chadse: ZULUL
[4:09:38] shumwhere: for your mute podcast, instead of calling them episodes, call them stages
[4:09:41] cosmicXDhehee: is shroud on the same server?
[4:09:43] heatemoji: shroud probably bought blizzard
[4:09:44] Ravnis: @Jibowo Yes i use them with Rift S, but you also need to buy the steam/htc base stations to make them work. Then a program called OVR space calibrator to track both types of tracking.
[4:09:53] amraz: shroud went to unpopulated server and used his boost
[4:09:54] Erokage68: @DragonxSlayer81 ya i quit for 6 months and missed on some good weapons

[4:10:55] heatemoji: your mute is in and u arent OMEGALUL

[4:11:02] TheYishai: @gritz_n_pitz I havent
[4:11:03] Ravnis: @Jibowo Honestly the trackers are 100 each, and you need 3. Then the base stations are around 150 and you need 2, so hontly almost cheaper to just buy a full Vive kit or index
