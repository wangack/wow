[0:48:21] chipchronly: imo you go 15% crit rune over fingers for FF then go in fire for imp scorch if you go zug zug

[0:50:50] wavecadet: @Xaryu what if you spec into combustion, and went burnout/hot streak? I think you would pump
[0:50:52] shwssss: you always run out of mana with burnout
[0:50:58] Cenarios13: frostfire costs so little mana

[1:19:55] Cjpriest: then they should ban streamers for taking handouts... thoughts?
[1:19:56] Moklolz: sit in front of stockage and you will be chocked by the spam of bot
[1:19:57] skoobss: over 10% of all wow players are bots. the problem is so massive thats is hard to actually comprehend
[1:19:59] pudnpopz: True LUL

[1:20:15] Darksyde1029: @sancXD Not excessive at all... just don't buy gold. Seriously, it's just that easy lol.
[1:20:18] ChairsHaveFeelings: I don't buy gold but I think a perma ban is excessive for the first offense
[1:20:19] TheSward: they missed the boat on that angle with sodapoppins @Xaryu
[1:20:19] ReconMazihoFanda: its runescape botting problem all agane
[1:20:21] adriankadz: maybe not perma , but like a 2week ban and deleting the gold from thier acc would do it
[1:20:22] RocketOgre: @Xaryu Just like how if you buy drugs you go to jail.  Now all the drug dealers are gone.
[1:20:24] Leobeans: yea i destroy rogues on my mage

[1:20:45] ShingaTV: bann him
[1:20:46] Cjpriest: the content doesnt matter... thats so biased
[1:20:47] Kisotope_: that would have sent the message more

[1:21:00] HelluvaWrecks: join a guild group so you can not 99 parse together. i swear joining a guild group is the worst thing you can do as a pug
[1:21:02] ZometTheComet: I agree with xar perma gold buyers
[1:21:03] ipntheshower: Yeah but it would have set a huge example, that just showed they dont really give af
[1:21:03] Platty_Daddyy: Xar its called the broken window theory in criminology for gold buying, look it up
[1:21:03] Gashunk1: The gold buying ruined the whole spectacle
[1:21:04] disciple007: and now soda doesn't stream WoW anymore anyways @Xaryu
[1:21:05] nintendyoh: so what did Soda do?
[1:21:08] ShingaTV: n1

[1:24:04] disciple007: @tuna_sandw1ch that's fair enough

[1:24:39] Gashunk1: they should try a new game OpieOP
[1:24:41] rns_aurelius: I don't think the levelling boost is necessarily the root problem. Everything before level cap feeling irrelevant is
[1:24:46] Cenarios13: @sancXD because soys like u are the reason there are bots Pepega
[1:24:47] bugge13: wait did u shave?
[1:24:50] joenewall: if you dont have time then stop playing lol
[1:24:56] belfastcl: or could've speed up the leveling process, but where is the money in that...
[1:25:03] Its_Garix: $60 is way too much for a boost. it costs more than the game lol
[1:25:05] chazmc89: @tuna_sandw1ch based
[1:25:07] taylorsdank: @joenewall YEP
[1:25:08] kindaopmusic: didnt 100% exp start today in sod?
[1:25:09] Kisotope_: what if it was a loot drop?
[1:25:09] disciple007: well ya your job is playing the game 40 hours a week
[1:25:14] jadedhunter99: How many have u used though?
[1:25:17] fuchai: that logic clearly didnt work as the sub numbers kept going down, when something is easy to get you dont care for it as much
[1:25:22] SelWrynn: Wasnt the first level boost in Cata or MoP?
[1:25:26] Erkal7: @kindaopmusic tomorrow for eu
[1:25:26] kevo_k: But at that point blizzard was losing so many people - Its either bring people in to keep the game alive or slowly die? right?
[1:25:28] tuna_sandw1ch: make WoW free, allow chinese bot farms
[1:25:39] inhaledthc: I agree
[1:25:39] alexgoat94: well it doesn't bother you because you do this for living, no offense bro. other people don't get to play as much.
[1:25:40] disciple007: progression? bro the leveling experience is just bad reruns

[1:26:38] oakleafresin: @Xaryu Xar How Much follower did u had 2 month ago ?
[1:26:40] pudnpopz: EZ Raiding
[1:26:41] Luucatoo: a few other games have "scroll of xp" which gives like +50% xp for 1 hour or something like that, its still bad but not that bad as a max lvl boost
[1:26:43] Gashunk1: cata is gonna rake in the level boost $$ big time instant success
[1:26:44] Jalapinot: @alexgoat94 Changing the way the game works impacts more than just the father of 8 working 7 jobs. It also impacts people who do have time to play and already enjoy the way the game is
[1:26:45] handovdoom666: if you've never leveled before you shouldn't be able to buy the boost. if you have, for example, max level warrior, shaman and pally and you wanted to play a priest, i have no issue to buy the boost. you'd done it before, you aren't a noob.
[1:26:51] SelWrynn: WoD brought SO many ppl back

[1:31:10] AustFisch: @nopassi0n ty time to buy my mount i been walking since they announced the cost decrease LUL
[1:31:16] lolartsection: I need farm gold to pay sub..
[1:31:26] Leobeans: WoW bought my diablo 4 but too bad d4 was ass
[1:31:38] SelWrynn: Last week they added a new $20 transmog to the store

[1:31:49] DrSwole: Dont think so
[1:31:49] Yokedo: Less money
[1:31:50] witchcvlt: They would make less money without microtransactions for sure
[1:31:51] Vio9: nope lol
[1:31:52] nickelius: No way
[1:31:53] Grashh: they make less 100%
[1:31:53] kriethos: less
[1:31:53] SelWrynn: nope
[1:31:54] einself111: prob not
[1:31:54] enigmasvea: less
[1:31:54] marzhul: no
[1:31:55] chickodie: not a chance

[1:32:00] Bishox: with mounts and transmog yes
[1:32:00] TARO_LV: they make more money with 12M chinese bot accounts
[1:32:04] isleswitch: microsoft puts it on game pass SeemsGood
[1:32:05] witchcvlt: game is past its prime, only way to make money is with micro transactions
[1:32:06] jordskii4tw: 15 a month vs 20 every week when i need gold
[1:32:06] chickodie: micro
[1:32:06] SelWrynn: the second one
[1:32:07] proteinbar___: But that's a riskier approach. That means they need to develop a good game
[1:32:08] Darksyde1029: Nope. Whales spend way too much on the cash shop.
[1:32:11] supermanthegod1: rmt makes most money
[1:32:13] kriethos: second one
[1:32:13] Bishox: @Xaryu with mounts and cosmetics yes , without more
[1:32:14] garhar1: What if Blizzard flat out just started selling gold lol
[1:32:18] chobinhood_: thats the reality of gaming now LUL
[1:32:19] domified: Whales are 80% of the profit.
[1:32:21] lindardrel: as someone in finance… it’s micro that make most
[1:32:23] ballerstatuslol: see the current state of retail for ur answer
[1:32:23] kindaopmusic: people love there wow tokens

[1:32:27] Bishox: @Xaryu with mounts and cosmetics yes , without no
[1:32:28] boywonda: make wow2 and make money then
[1:32:32] Kisotope_: blizzard DDoS'd themselves to insert the bots
[1:32:32] jakaupr: Can I link?
[1:32:33] shadowvypers: 1 boost = 4 months of subs
[1:32:34] SelWrynn: its the 80/20 rule
[1:32:35] akvokrom: Whales are 80% of the profit
[1:32:35] disciple007: if they sticked to the vanilla leveling experience the game would of died even faster
[1:32:35] thumperch: They'd change their whole business model if the current wasn't the most profitable
[1:32:35] depressiongoblins: they need to take the Jagex approach and make the game FREE and subscribing offers benefits that make the experience better
[1:32:36] ShingaTV: the playerbase has to stand up or no change
[1:32:37] lPeat: how about 12 million subs + token and stuff
[1:32:44] MonkeyOverlord: yeah because sequel MMOs really worked out for other games
[1:32:45] norryy: norryy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 5 month streak! xarCoC
[1:32:48] PMA_1: need more boats
[1:32:49] kindaopmusic: everyone i raid with in wrath buy a bunch of tokens
[1:32:50] Belugasgohard: time to play private servers
[1:32:51] SelWrynn: Long term? lol
[1:32:53] deanoxs: they try to milk without pissing off that ppl quit. walking on the edge
[1:32:54] UnsafeCell: are you sure that’s what most ppl want?
[1:32:55] HerrZwiebel: TInfoil hat on: Blizzard works with RMT sellers
[1:33:00] SelWrynn: nobody thinks in long term anymore
[1:33:00] Irhlin: take company private
[1:33:02] amazonianshroomsniffer: cash shop should be cosmetic only
[1:33:03] kirk_hunts: a reskinned mount they sell for $60 costs them literally pennies to make vs the $15 a month actually is suppose to cover the cost of running the game.
[1:33:03] chickodie: whales could pay for thousands of subs by themselves
[1:33:04] Vio9: even so most companies don't care about long term gains anymore
[1:33:05] delicioustoast4: yeah but people who are creative also have a vision of creating something worthwile not just a money printer
[1:33:15] UnsafeCell: most ppl just want p2w
[1:33:22] jbeemerks: it’s almost like they need a different version of the game that’s more like vanilla
[1:33:22] disciple007: Give me Legion classic already
[1:33:22] geminuspr: Its over for gaming. They litetally hire psychologists to milk ppl
[1:33:23] pudnpopz: Legion Kreygasm

[1:34:06] bugge13: legion waaaay better
[1:34:06] constipated_overlord: Legion & M+ it was great

[1:34:08] hirbelhumpf: legion was BiS
[1:34:10] chazmc89: free legendarys... Kappa
[1:34:14] CursedSeraphim: everyone gets 3 legendaries. the name legendary means nothing anymore
[1:34:14] Kwaai: legion was good but the legendary system on its launch was the worst system they've ever put in
[1:34:24] Alton_4: legion was the expansion which every content was GOLD...Mythis plus,Raiding,Mage Tower ,PvP
[1:34:26] stabley95: Legion is the goat of the modern stuff, legendary system was its only downfall
[1:34:31] lanebyy: wow died after wotlk
[1:34:33] CursedSeraphim: the rarity should be downgraded by 1 level again. legendaries should be epics epics blues, etc
[1:34:36] kirk_hunts: I wish Blackrock Foundry was in another expansion so I could talk about how great it was without everyone screaming WOD sucks.
[1:34:36] MonkeyOverlord: Legion will always be regarded as a great expansion because of mythic plus
[1:34:37] SelWrynn: Legion was better because there was more content.  WoD had better questing
[1:34:44] tuplin: Anyone who played Legion and thought the start was good is absolutely fried
[1:34:49] deanoxs: legion world pvp was pretty cool , first time for a long time
[1:34:51] AtomicHydraa: blizz killed Diablo the exact same way prove me wrong
[1:34:52] SpaceCowboy0811: @lanebyy agreed, but i did enjoy MoP
[1:34:59] Tomfromuk: @lanebyy wasnt itrs highest ever sub count recorded during cataclysm

[1:36:10] CorgonZA: After Wrath, the only expansions that I personally enjoyed were MoP and Legion.
[1:36:13] SelWrynn: Legendary drops and artifact leveling was UTTER TRASH
[1:36:16] deanoxs: hardcast pyro KEKW
[1:36:18] Darksyde1029: Modern WoW, aka WoD forward, is all just terrible. We're comparing different types of shit at this point when talking about Legion vs. BFA etc. Would you rather eat dog or cat shit? Doesn't matter it's all shit.
[1:36:21] kone_malone: SL is a stain on wow - I would take 3 WoDs in a row over a single SL lol
[1:36:35] Esten80: Thats why SoD is the shit
[1:36:38] Kwaai: the legendary bug that increased your chances to get a second one after your first lmao

[1:37:08] eaksyn: luck = time investment
[1:37:13] Snorlax_King: @Tooting_TV dragonflight is a good xpac if you dont do the dragonflight content XD
[1:37:18] constipated_overlord: I liked titanforged stuff, some randomness for once
[1:37:27] odirtydave: you gonna do SSF HC? or too scurred because no free fiery weps?
[1:37:28] tuna_sandw1ch: work first, family second
[1:37:30] Lanolinlol: tru NODDERS
[1:37:31] jasonshenTFT: xdd
[1:37:31] Alton_4: one major downside with Legion was how much slot locked u had by each tier...basically 2 leggos, 4 tier pieces ,1 bis trinket(was always cof for me )
[1:37:35] foxthemelon: metzen looks like george michael
[1:37:36] eaksyn: this guy has a very weird bias against some stuff
[1:37:41] kindaopmusic: LUL LUL
[1:37:44] Alton_4: So you basically had 2 items to upgrade most of the time
[1:37:46] deathmessage666: Best expansion for me will always be WoD I just loved the Garrison and the Ships.
[1:37:51] Zoismoe: can you sell wow tokens for real money or just gold chat? anyone know
[1:37:51] Reaperz_kinetic: @constipated_overlord theres already randomness.... that level of RNG was terrible
[1:37:58] Gashunk1: ngl chris metzen coming back gives me hope, call me naive
[1:38:00] jakaupr: D:
[1:38:02] phanatico: RIP
[1:38:02] depressiongoblins: some of yall are fking tripping. nighthold alone is one of the greatest raids blizz has made in a long time
[1:38:05] sweettacoo: private servers are the best
[1:38:09] SelWrynn: Metzen is the one WoW dev that I think receives universal praise
[1:38:12] Belugasgohard: Project Epoch HYPE
[1:38:18] disciple007: you should be banned permanently if you ever played on a private server Kappa
[1:38:18] fetza108: i have a  loremaster horde and alliance character in retail KEKW
[1:38:21] atill_a: when is the 100% exp buff?
[1:38:29] macjcool: didnt they just move the servers to russia

[1:39:12] OrganikCum: same
[1:39:13] EternalGamesNaN: blizzard maffia
[1:39:13] alrik_plays: @ReconMazihoFanda Cant say that loud enough.
[1:39:15] eaksyn: less lag in classic LUL
[1:39:23] fetza108: @atill_a march 6th on eu
[1:39:25] Mahca_: Clap
[1:39:26] disciple007: that looks like ass tho
[1:39:34] atill_a: @fetza108 aight thank you
[1:39:35] Vio9: we thought we did, and we did
[1:39:35] Nezhoni: oh no
[1:39:42] hajanatorator: and the guy is still playing the game :D
[1:39:44] LimpsNoodles: @Xaryu tripped stache?!
[1:39:48] LimpsNoodles: trimmed
[1:39:49] h3xoffender: I never ever got a more feeling of classic than privat servers
[1:39:53] depressiongoblins: everyone should just move to the grey market. they have a better product than blizzard
[1:40:00] SelWrynn: consoomer
[1:40:01] alrik_plays: @eaksyn as we can just see in STV, whenever more than 40 ppl get together. We had 200v200 battles on Nostalrius without lag and without layers
[1:40:05] iSensimillhai: @xaryu why doesnt blizz just do when gta did and buy the private servers? and run them right their way
[1:40:10] smashdakeys: boomer
[1:40:16] WillWoW: doubt
[1:40:22] DrSwole: bathe
[1:40:24] Kuja_: YEP
[1:40:34] ReconMazihoFanda: let the players bathe
[1:40:35] riveroysterdd: @iSensimillhai because this requires more human resources aka money
[1:40:37] HerrZwiebel: Blizzard doenst care bout their customers change my mind
[1:40:39] RebornOG: where did young xaryu come frome
[1:40:40] the_hoood: that happens too me
[1:40:46] OrganikCum: it's too far gone, the gameplay is so far from good it would take a full gameplay redesign
[1:40:46] Sourmash26: Who is taking time off for wow haha
[1:40:49] AcidRain10890: lol take off four weeks???
[1:40:52] garhar1: time management is essential
[1:40:52] SelWrynn: I hope War Within is good, then I checked Retail Wowhead and the top story was a new $20 transmog, my care for the expansion disappeared
[1:40:59] JukezZA: morning xar
[1:41:05] Granteater4: I would love to play a bunch of wow. Don't have the time for anything more than 2-3 hours a week
[1:41:08] constipated_overlord: hold on, depends how good the expansion is. I resign for a decent job to play more  Wrath :D
[1:41:10] awalker009: Unlike TV shows that can adapt to audience getting older, games can't do that.
[1:41:10] alrik_plays: @Sourmash26 crazy that people exist with other lifes than you, right?
[1:41:11] Legaccy404: I have played wow since tbc and im 23 years old I guess we are a minority LULW
[1:41:13] EternalGamesNaN: Warcraft had a huge buildup to World of Warcraft
[1:41:13] druib: Bro has streamer brain thinking we can take 4 weeks off to play wow
[1:41:16] Caleb_Pressley: big true
[1:41:20] chazmc89: @Xaryu i buy every expansion, level to max and play the story, and then quit a month after... everytime. i just dont enjoy it like i used to
[1:41:24] KaiZeEKing: actually a good point
[1:41:26] Caleb_Pressley: it is doomed to fail
[1:41:28] MonkeyOverlord: FailFish using boomer for 30 and 40 year olds
[1:41:32] deanoxs: maybe the boomers dont quit and lose their jobs LUL
[1:41:32] t1isokatleague: boomers are doomers now
[1:41:34] einself111: game is super bloated no new players stick around
[1:41:34] hughjazz8: Agree, I can't play anymore after having a kid all I do is watch steamers lol
[1:41:34] TodBobertson: Hot take: Shadowlands was good.
[1:41:34] stoutside: could just make a game that works for boomers
[1:41:35] Catalystic_Sudo: streamer brain tbf
[1:41:36] prism_ike: unless they cater to the new gen players the game will die eventually
[1:41:39] joshWASHED: cant u just play on weekends lol
[1:41:39] lizardboiy: if wow released a good xpac it wouldn't be considered a "boomer game"
[1:41:41] JukezZA: did you just start watching pandoras box again? or have you watched alot ?
[1:41:42] AtomicHydraa: people think playing wow requires “time off” wtf is wrong with chat
[1:41:42] p0werslav3: LOL youngest "boomers" are in their 60s
[1:41:45] Nuggnuts: OSRS is more popular than it ever has been... Why?
[1:41:45] Reaperz_kinetic: @druib he literally said we DONT have time for that....
[1:41:45] OrganikCum: word would spread and the community of retail gamers would expand
[1:41:47] BeansAnToast: wow 2 pending
[1:41:47] Catalystic_Sudo: I’d never get that much time off work
[1:41:52] mickster111: thats a lie if the asmon says its a good game then the scourge will play it
[1:41:52] the_hoood: i love WoW but i don't have time too play it
[1:41:53] adamanttv101: i feel like why would you be so busy that you cant play at all
[1:41:58] Catalystic_Sudo: 1 week is hard enough
[1:42:00] Vio9: it's not doomed to fail, just doomed to stagnate in playerbase
[1:42:02] Rindu: OSRS <3
[1:42:03] fetza108: BFA zones and music are perfect
[1:42:05] domdomo: hmmm
[1:42:05] AtomicHydraa: if you can’t take two hours out of your night for your own sanity no one can help you
[1:42:09] RebornOG: azeshit
[1:42:10] TodBobertson: SL > BfA
[1:42:11] Kynealdyr: It's the whole Gen X doesn't exist thought all over again
[1:42:17] fetza108: @TodBobertson never
[1:42:18] grayscael: actually the worst expansion
[1:42:21] Darksyde1029: People wouldn't quit it, but it's not possible for them to release a good expansion anymore because the framework of the game doesn't allow it. The game is unrecognizable from what it was when it was considered good, and no expansion can fix that.

[2:00:22] schlangensuizid: yall say rbg isnt fun to watch but arena is horrible to watch
[2:00:22] Darksyde1029: Players never had an opportunity to watch competitive RBGs though since there's never been an RBG tournament format put on by Blizzard. I don't know if it would've been more successful, but it was never a thing that existed as an option.
[2:00:27] spartatronix: i still play hots :D
[2:00:28] bigwilly3737: arena is just who can kite around a pillar the best

[2:01:27] adam_brisbane: Hot take, Arena is a failure for esport for the size of Wow compared to the size of other games esports in viewership and prize money
[2:01:27] cookie_jayy: Doesnt LoL give like millions for their prize pool, and so does CSGO?

[2:02:06] Vichrinox: how is that a defense lol
[2:02:06] SelWrynn: vague enough to be safe legally, just not morally
[2:02:07] roooogu: blizzard was cool 24 years ago
[2:02:08] Darksyde1029: @griffski_ Don't watch retail streamers, but that's irrelevant. We're already 15 years down a timeline where arena was chosen as the format to be platformed by blizzard officially. If they made RBGs in TBC and made the first blizzcon PvP tournament an RBG tournament then history may have played out differently. We'll never know.
[2:02:08] surprisecuddles: that's not a defense. that's offensive
[2:02:09] rns_aurelius: that's no in blizzards defence thats intentional deception
[2:02:09] ReallyThough: @adam_brisbane people dont watch it... so
[2:02:10] Iamelele: yeah but that's the legal definition of false advertising
[2:02:10] hs_joe_supportsynapse: its basically a scam

[2:15:13] SpaceCowboy0811: they dont care about the player. just the stocks
[2:15:23] inspect4: @ploetze1 ye
[2:15:23] JPeaches: @taylorsdank I mean he was clearly getting screwed, but doing the same strat 3 times in a row just lets your opponent adapt
[2:15:24] rathura: It is not imaginable that a company can come through with so many bullshit, what a weird world we live in
[2:15:27] TheSward: wc3 was one of my favorite games of all time and what led me to wow in the first place, was so sad to see how bad they bungled reforged
[2:15:29] TodBobertson: @Reaperz_kinetic EZ block, keep spergin kid.

[2:16:03] Sunderwire_: the maw was the worst zone ever made
[2:16:04] jasonshenTFT: blizzard is good at building up hype, bad at living up to it KEKW
[2:16:05] mikenet57: It was such a cool idea until they nerfed it
[2:16:07] Beirris: I liked torgast
[2:16:11] RaizenHQ: Torghast was awful
[2:16:12] rns_aurelius: so much of it feels like busy work to keep metrics up
[2:16:16] rathura: It is not imaginable that a company can come through with so many bullshit, what a weird world we live in
[2:16:18] ChairsHaveFeelings: I thought Torghast was fun......
[2:16:21] cookie_jayy: @Stinzo92 freaking banger, I used to play that on the SNES
[2:16:21] klaymiester: Hot take: I enjoyed Choreghast

[2:16:27] Tanthok: Visions
[2:16:27] pleca14: visions
[2:16:28] Am0n3r: Choregast was a fun concept, but executed poorly
[2:16:29] Fnafson: magetower
[2:16:31] ArjanaEU: visions were cool at first
[2:16:36] peashooterpete: A roguelike mode in wow should be awesome but they messed it up
[2:16:38] gunzpewpew: Shadowlands could had been good without choregast, the maw and legendaries
[2:16:38] RealDecon: i liked torgast on first char.... mad repetative toward the end tho
[2:16:39] Am0n3r: Visions were cool while undergeared
[2:16:42] Baron_Colvin: Will Delves be the new one?
[2:16:45] tookotron: thorghast was fun like 1 or 2 times
[2:16:47] Jixson_: torghast was good until you had to do it too much
[2:16:48] TARO_LV: I blame us... we keep getting shit from blizzard and continue to break sales records when ever a new expansion comes out... fool us 4 times shame on us
[2:16:52] Sunderwire_: yep
[2:16:53] Rev3rendBilly: Okay, another retail rant.
[2:16:54] Am0n3r: Mawnted
[2:16:55] jasonshenTFT: the M OMEGALUL W
[2:16:55] ZometTheComet: yes ah but we have these crap eaters who like the bad systems so we get more
[2:16:57] Mahca_: maybe they’re afraid of a cod situation where people say they’re just releasing the same stuff each year
[2:16:57] zebercetanayurt: roguelike mode would be indeed very nice but not like this
[2:17:05] azylum99: new game modes should be minor and/or optional on their first expansion appearance and then maybe expanded later on if it's a cussedd
[2:17:06] inspect4: The throne of thunder thingy was best so far
[2:17:13] fetza108: in shadowlands the unlocking systems were so bad
[2:17:17] hiddjes: torghast was kinda cool tho, it was just the issue that you HAD to do it
[2:17:19] ZometTheComet: if we can ditch the people who keep liking the crap systems we can get more
[2:17:20] saxxon540: Torghast was awesome, and then they turned it into a mandatory weekly grind
[2:17:25] patthepostman96: maw felt fine, no mounts always a win imo

[2:17:56] SelWrynn: certainly for worse
[2:18:00] rns_aurelius: covenant system couldve been great
[2:18:01] chalupacabras: I love love love what Blizzard is doing with WoW Classic and WoW SOD. HOWEVER, all of these choices that Blizzard has made with Retail for the past few expansions feel like such a "we know better than you" with chores and borrowed power.
[2:18:04] Beirris: Ardenweald was a beautifull zone, the vampire zone aswell
[2:18:17] Sunderwire_: facts
[2:18:19] logn2time: 80% of their new features end up sucking KEKW
[2:18:20] naturalduck: Dragonflight was good tho

[2:19:03] SelWrynn: New expansion brings new system that players don't like -> players complain for months -> blizz fixes system in final patch of expansion -> repeat

[2:19:41] ZometTheComet: This is what happens when blizzard ret cons lore due to twitter Andy’s crying
[2:19:41] biohazardstv: Blizzard has a tendency to come up with mechanics on paper, but...  The problem is they don't realize the fault of the mechanics and us the community has to suffer until they see the so-called problem which by the way takes months to fix.

[2:31:00] Akselky: So you are saying there were nice people in the nazi party?

[3:12:42] reefo: @espi ya i think this is right, but in general they are around 500-1000
[3:12:45] NutterCircus: Farming the other mage groups.
[3:12:48] tedo781: geez it’s like over 100 coins in 1.5 mins of work on average..haha
[3:12:49] dontgetworked: @FrostEmVP this is 100% optional lmao
[3:12:50] iPlayCuzFun: @TehNella yeah basically all classes have 1 bis item u can buy, that u can get in like 2-3 events
[3:12:56] ChairsHaveFeelings: @shadowstrikez999 He's playing SoD atm
[3:12:56] Doimos89: I you fix it now what about all you people abusing it? should your coins get removed?
[3:13:02] Tobbehs: can probably skip 3 tbh
[3:13:02] Griszly_: make it to where you can't party EZ
[3:13:08] deanoxs: how many coins are needed to buy the stuff overall?
[3:13:09] inhaledthc: yeah and how many bloods u have a the end u just get em as coins as soon as the event ends not a bad idea
[3:13:14] llamaar: it is very boring to watch…
[3:13:20] jerry5232: This looks fun..
[3:13:24] TehNella: @iplaycuzfun 2-3 events if you do it like he is here or if you’re a regular person? 😂
[3:13:32] ImSo1337: Yea this blows to watch haha
[3:13:34] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: looks like there are a ton of people just pvping normally on the way to the loa, dunno why you have to stop what this is
[3:13:37] iPlayCuzFun: @deanoxs 1000 bloods = 10 silver. and most items cost 10-15 silver
[3:13:47] SghettiBoy: no aoe spells or effects in a bubble surrounding the coin turn in?
[3:13:49] Haosanaa: make a 3sec pull timer macro? xd
[3:13:53] naturalduck: Mount today?
[3:13:55] bigwilly3737: bro the xp boost in sm rn is 200 k
[3:13:56] BlownFuse_: how is this not fixed uet
[3:13:57] SghettiBoy: like a spell nullifying zone or something
[3:13:59] BlownFuse_: yet. its so lame
[3:14:00] lil_yahteez: how many you farm so far?
[3:14:01] Lukri0us: DBM
[3:14:02] Haosanaa: its dbm
[3:14:03] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[3:14:04] miciahclay: @Doimos89 No? Just like everything else, they don't remove people playing the game. They didn't remove the Ash even layer hopping, didn't remove everyone mass farming at the start of this event, they wouldn't remove anything if they "fix" this. Abuse early, abuse often ;)
[3:14:05] TARO_LV: they mid as well give out the PVP items for free at this point. thousands of players have famred the mount like this
[3:14:05] iPlayCuzFun: @TehNella regular person, he would get 1 epic just off this event but he already has them
[3:14:07] strangepleb: @Xaryu  Basicly doinh pve farming at this point
[3:14:08] deanoxs: @iPlayCuzFun holy shit thats expensive
[3:14:08] Lukri0us: nut everyone should have DBM
[3:14:09] FrierenHC: you look good today xaryu
[3:14:11] DiggyDogDave: Its actually cool you can do that with a 5 stack, the other poster was on point, they just need to spread the event out from a single point
[3:14:16] keithlistlll: world pvp? why dont you make 40 mage group
[3:14:23] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: just give warriors spell reflect, that will solve this
[3:14:26] Breakfist_: if u dont have DBE what are u doing
[3:14:30] bigwilly3737: shobek is already level 5 and hes done 2 quests
[3:14:32] kief770: mark the zg elites
[3:14:32] Breakfist_: DBM**
[3:14:36] SunYuHong: top tier content
[3:14:39] iPlayCuzFun: @deanoxs nah because most ppl make 5-10 silver per event, and if an epic is 10-15silver its very easy grind
[3:14:40] naturalduck: @scaredmoneywontmakemoney can't reflect an AOE lol
[3:14:40] xProloli: holy nova priest with 4 mage?
[3:14:51] Chaduceus: did you already do gnomer?
[3:14:53] medmalekch: 5 mages is nice?
[3:15:00] huckleson: airsoftfatty LOL
[3:15:03] TehNella: @iplaycuzfun word I appreciate it I just started playing sod so it’s very helpful
[3:15:03] NutterCircus: LMAO
[3:15:06] SghettiBoy: omg
[3:15:08] schraler: maybe cap Chronomantic healing buff at 1 instead of 5?
[3:15:10] SghettiBoy: i hate this lmao
[3:15:11] garhar1: jesus christ dude
[3:15:14] jstuwie: xarPog xarPog xarPog
[3:15:16] windatar: Obviously the best thing to do to nerf this is to take away all stamina on all mage gear going forward so they can die in two hits in pvp.
[3:15:16] Breakfist_: on pace for like 2400 coins
[3:15:21] Farenheight451: "why is STV so laggy"
[3:15:22] TheSward: this is pretty silly
[3:15:27] Magris: this is gonna be 2k coins
[3:15:29] NutterCircus: 3 groups of Mages farming eachother LUL
[3:15:30] SghettiBoy: while im lucky to get 300 coins becasue of lag and stuff like this
[3:15:31] lw_baleeiro: After you turn in the coins ou don't earn more for a few seconds.
[3:15:35] ChairsHaveFeelings: They need to remove the 255 cap on bloods.... let me farm
[3:15:47] rx_maryj: big love guy
[3:15:54] Taven_The_Bold: That makes the boomy spam at the start of SoD look fun tbh. At least you could chase them down
[3:15:58] thighrider: make people have skill can’t group with same class
[3:16:00] blacksocks242: didnt mages get a large healing buff today too?
[3:16:02] Lincolnl0g: true
[3:16:03] Hiena008: What you get the coins from? From killing enemies near pillar or just attacking pillar LUL ?
[3:16:06] iPlayCuzFun: @TehNella welcome to the game brother, its hella fun but dont stress it enjoy the journey
[3:16:09] Lincolnl0g: I like altars just no cap
[3:16:12] NutterCircus: It has become just mages trading kills for coins KEKL
[3:16:15] Lincolnl0g: altars incentive people to group up
[3:16:16] S0LSTICEech0: nothing
[3:16:20] xxxmagicwizardxxx: dead in 20 sec run back dead in 20 sec
[3:16:22] S0LSTICEech0: ive been saying this the whole time
[3:16:22] adam_brisbane: pepople would be to spread out
[3:16:22] Vesir_1: altars are to force conflict
[3:16:22] Xzanelol: it was 550ish before wasnt it? random ass change
[3:16:23] Arradim: Altars create hubs
[3:16:24] revora_: @hiena008 players in general. Not just near pillar
[3:16:25] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: is 255 cap a system constraint?
[3:16:25] craw1122: There wont be a place where people congrugate
[3:16:26] Diddly_dope: the turnins help give areas that will draw people to fight
[3:16:26] ferknasty: they need to remove groups period. it would be 10000000x more fun if it was every man for themselves
[3:16:26] foxwinkle: People would just hide in the corner
[3:16:26] Lukri0us: Harder to find other players
[3:16:28] ferknasty: this is lame
[3:16:28] windatar: But literally the easiest fix for this is make people unable to group together in STV have it truly become an FFA.
[3:16:29] SghettiBoy: turn in points are incentives for spots of conflict
[3:16:31] running_backing: a solution to a problem that doesnt exist
[3:16:31] FarmerCray: people will camp in cringe spots
[3:16:32] coldsarsparilla: china will eventually see that im actually a human u ai pieces of shit
[3:16:32] tomzi1: remove blood loss on death
[3:16:35] haukewood_: no POI?
[3:16:36] lilodot: need point of interest to group players to actually fight
[3:16:40] Lincolnl0g: 115 damn
[3:16:41] Cryof53: too spread out and never seeing anyone?
[3:16:41] DiggyDogDave: Does the amount of blood you have impact the amount someone receives when killing you?
[3:16:42] foxwinkle: harder to see other people
[3:16:42] Haematopodidae: how is this not win trading?
[3:16:43] Vesir_1: on lower pop servers, altars are there to force 'populous' zones
[3:16:44] garhar1: jumped from 95 to 175 jfc
[3:16:45] ponaris: Would be the same at spirits then everyone fighting around spiris
[3:16:48] BlownFuse_: instead they just let mages farm for 2 weeks. meanwhile I. can barely get 300 coins an event on my warlock
[3:16:48] miciahclay: @windatar Yeah screw healers man, they don't deserve coins xD
[3:16:48] Monsowhs: Just make people lose a lot of blood on death so you have to think about dieing and using the map properly
[3:16:49] Lincolnl0g: holy shit
[3:16:53] sgohst: hey @Xaryu how do you display %'s on the target bar?
[3:16:54] Mahca_: just make it give copper coins straight away instead of blood
[3:16:56] Lincolnl0g: 3000?!?!
[3:16:57] shadowvypers: you gotlike 200 that time
[3:16:59] keithlistlll: what the coins get
[3:17:00] naturalduck: @diggydogdave yes, you get more for killing ppl with high stacks
[3:17:01] Lincolnl0g: by the end of
[3:17:05] JamesIRL: uncleruckus carrying
[3:17:05] tomzi1: maging
[3:17:06] churuby: do you think it would be more fun if it was actually free for all? no 5 mans
[3:17:08] Monsowhs: Just make people lose a lot of blood on death so you have to think about dieing and using the .map properly
[3:17:09] DiggyDogDave: @naturalduck gotcha ty
[3:17:10] xBuffDaddyx: ive had 3500 at arena
[3:17:12] zerozuckerl: @windatar nah dont take away the community aspect of classic wow thats horrible
[3:17:13] NutterCircus: Peak Mage PVP EleGiggle
[3:17:16] ChairsHaveFeelings: How many more silver coins do you need for the mount?
[3:17:17] TARO_LV: 3000.... thats the mount in 3 events lmfao blizzard is just the best
[3:17:19] Ervill1: who do we blame? players for coming up with shyt like this or devs for making this possible to do?
[3:17:20] Hiena008: @revora_ Thanks. Is it in all SGV or radius around pillar?
[3:17:28] kindaopmusic: lol you got 175+ there
[3:17:30] Cryptikwow: Get rid of altars and at end you turn in and spot and also just have copper and not silver @Xaryu
[3:17:30] Lolpak007: 3400 top for me
[3:17:31] Linkan484: Good farming spot there Xaryu haha
[3:17:32] keithlistlll: the coins just turn in for pvp point?
[3:17:34] SlapdickWoWplayer: brb...leveling a mage
[3:17:35] NutterCircus: That run was POG AF
[3:17:38] windatar: @miciahclay Give healers a buff that increases the damage they deal by 100%. Easy PZ.
[3:17:42] miciahclay: @Ervill1 Devs 100%, players will just adapt to whatever changes anyway
[3:17:43] Monsowhs: Just make people lose a lot of blood on death so you have to think about dieing and using the map properly!
[3:17:46] Dreamlights: Are you really having fun doing this ?
[3:17:50] Lekar624: Oh so you get the coins right away now?
[3:17:53] naturalduck: Don't change anything :)
[3:17:55] ChairsHaveFeelings: @TARO_LV 3000 per event is not easy to do and is not common
[3:18:02] Ervill1: i dont see this as fun even as the mage tbh
[3:18:03] iPlayCuzFun: @Lekar624 he gets them because he stacks on the altar
[3:18:07] MrSchneetzel: who wouldnt have fun doing this abusive shit??
[3:18:08] chb1889: what is it I'm witnessing here?
[3:18:16] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: even as a warrior i can charge in and ww all the amges and get 100 coinds each respawn
[3:18:18] Somnolint: Stealth groups are alot of fun
[3:18:18] YlaWoW: Does it not get repetative?
[3:18:19] CholThemAll: how much coin do u make per battle with this setup, Xar?
[3:18:20] reefo: this is fine, i've done better than this in a regular group
[3:18:21] nickstirratt: can you let us know how many coins u get each  death? just outta interest
[3:18:21] Diddly_dope: shouldnt have aoe on the turn ins lol
[3:18:22] Dreamlights: I don't find it fun at all even if I was the mage
[3:18:26] Eggzactly54: i wont even bother anymore till its fixed. feeding mages blood isnt fun
[3:18:27] Monsowhs: Just make people lose a lot of blood on death so you have to think about dieing and using the map properly
[3:18:27] Lekar624: Oh I didn't realize there were multiple altars, just knew about the arena one
[3:18:28] Lincolnl0g: I mean there’s plenty of ppl not under altar
[3:18:32] Auslanderrr: you’re part of the problem
[3:18:32] succaw: but let me abuse it rq to get my epic mount before they do KEKW
[3:18:32] hsayus123: Kapp

[3:19:18] reefo: not lying, dont have to prove anything to you. this isn't that strong though
[3:19:19] Knaxxis: most ppl here r lying for their comment to get read out loud

[3:20:07] iPlayCuzFun: @TheSward only 3? i got like 200 gold in 5 min then i quit
[3:20:08] Magris: i mean you could even just move the boss way away from alter turns in and put him on a path to just run around randomely
[3:20:09] JukezZA: *Oracles
[3:20:12] SghettiBoy: mage is ez life
[3:20:15] espi: @Jiglojay8 they're optimizing
[3:20:15] kordellbennett: @thesward wut
[3:20:18] themadfeltcher: 100 solo is not bad
[3:20:25] RyploTV: my best solo on rogue is 250.
[3:20:27] Nytsongx: bro that succckkkkssssss wh at do you mean
[3:20:29] garhar1: I went blade flurry with rogue and got 600 solo
[3:20:29] espi: you can get more solo by just farming mobs in the zone lol
[3:20:30] dankcheezits: @breakfist_ those are part of xaryus dailies. Wow isn't everything
[3:20:31] JohnnyBokelo_: that is just unfair asf
[3:20:31] themadfeltcher: I joined late on my enh shaman, last 10 mins solo and got about 60
[3:20:32] garhar1: was painful tho
[3:20:32] Mcflury1705: Can someone explain what is going on?
[3:20:33] JukezZA: i got 400 doing this mage shit solo KEKW
[3:20:35] hsayus123: mages can get exalted ab this way in like 2 days
[3:20:38] n0lllie: how can 100 be good when you get 3k
[3:20:39] SlapdickWoWplayer: @espi thats what i was tinking lol
[3:20:41] gigadoinkz: ye u can get a few hundred if you get good picks
[3:20:43] MastisLove: What do u ppl farm the coins for? I mean i ha e bought every item long ago, the mounts i dont fancy, and for now, arathi rep i dont need?
[3:20:44] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: you can get pretty good on arms if you just farm the mages as they get low
[3:20:45] Laaun123: not gonna lie, this looks like the most boring shit ever
[3:20:46] Breakfist_: @dankcheezits xp waste
[3:20:47] iPlayCuzFun: this event is actually hella fun when u dont care about the coins
[3:20:47] ColePowerz: i was averaging 2-300 each event as  arogue
[3:20:49] xpredicts: Best I got was 1k with a random group comp
[3:20:50] gigadoinkz: nah lol
[3:20:51] Bishox: YEP
[3:20:52] windatar: They should
[3:20:56] NawtyTyme: that would be dope
[3:20:56] Bishox: they 100% should
[3:20:58] inhaledthc: @xaryu this sucks lol xD
[3:20:58] widicuwous: @MastisLove stream content
[3:20:59] rudIey: @Mahca_ i bum rush the alter and steal kills with execute and average around 200 now :)
[3:20:59] JukezZA: YES
[3:21:00] tomzi1: deff
[3:21:00] espi: there would be solo mages aoe farming lol
[3:21:00] themadfeltcher: I personally wish they scaled it per players in group
[3:21:02] knifeparty818: i get 300-400 solo as a rogue sometimes more
[3:21:02] JukezZA: THATS THE FIX
[3:21:03] Seoken1: I can get 200-300 solo literally as my pet as hunter, 600-700 actually trying, and 2k-2500 with a group typically
[3:21:03] reefo: @squishyalpaca20 we use what people have available, but it's usually boomkin, mage, rogue, priest, shaman
[3:21:04] windatar: I can get about 700 coins solo as a ret pally.
[3:21:05] themadfeltcher: to encourage < 5 mans
[3:21:06] kief770: Should get more blood the smaller your group is
[3:21:10] I34773: I suggested soloplayers should always have the boss buff zone wide and got a lot of hate for it on reddit lul
[3:21:10] ggbr0sky: yep solo content good idea in classic
[3:21:10] Addiiboy: just stop that alter stuff....
[3:21:14] JukezZA: Make STV a solo event
[3:21:15] SlapdickWoWplayer: i average like 400-600 on with my normal 5 man guild group...its not much but its honest work

[4:15:05] gregfork: It's really really really bad. You could take off healing runes and it wouldn't make a difference, 100 hps is nothing in gnomer
[4:15:05] femto_fox: arcane is the play
[4:15:06] xOutcoldx: spec is all RNG based sadly no brainfreeze no crits etc

[5:44:47] eaksyn: not before p4 will we get 100% mounts
[5:44:51] Shelltonius: The mount doesnt actually require training so its possible it gets auto upgraded

[5:45:12] jandoodle2: monteOpa

[5:45:29] silverwasp: you're not gonna use it in 6 months
[5:45:30] Synthez542: What if they make another mount for 200 silver for 100%?
[5:45:32] Miinimango: they gotta make it so u can upgrade them cool mounts
[5:45:32] turik13: @Xaryu Worlf first horde killed Keltuzad!
[5:45:39] CubicleGangster: It costs no gold and doesn't require a riding skill, they wont make it 100%

[6:16:15] SavageFy: @Xaryu use your pull timer that's built into DBM to set a group timer for respawns.
[6:16:18] saltb0mber: its not a great spree u just stopped doing a stupid tactic
[6:16:19] SavageFy: Should just be /pull 3
[6:16:19] killadalegend: EZ
[6:16:20] Carepai: ez
[6:16:21] ledpredatorx: where are the hunters for all these mages

[6:16:27] twistedbinkz: @xaryu how do you get the mount ?
[6:16:27] Rawz1337: I mean i want the mount, but i stopped doing this event
[6:16:40] iBanEvader: gaymers be minmaxing
[6:16:48] StunningPaul: Oh yeah he wants a hotfix after he gets the mount PopNemo PopNemo PopNemo PopNemo
[6:16:48] koooosy: dude get in the blizzard
[6:16:50] timmys7f: Why not go full arcane for the event? Can pop Arcane Power every 3 mins, plus clearcasting, and 9% more crit on your Arcane Explosion?
[6:16:55] SnackshotGod: you wont care if they hotfix youll have mount and be done with the event lmao
[6:16:55] mrbluesky1337: why should they hotfix a strength of the class LUL
[6:16:56] zebercetanayurt: @StunningPaul lol
[6:16:57] SmashTheDude: what if you can't get blood from being like 3000 yds from altar? @Xaryu
[6:17:02] djthedan123: how is this pvp?
[6:17:08] naitsabezk: well this is lame xD
[6:17:11] Indomitablez: @djthedan123 Its not. Its grinding
[6:17:12] jandoodle2: monteOpa
[6:17:17] iBanEvader: they should make the coins account bound
[6:17:20] WonderfulTimes: just reduce aoe damage in the event tbh
[6:17:22] iBanEvader: gives me a reason to make a mage
[6:17:22] Hello_Im_Mattias: heatonMode heatonMode heatonMode heatonMode heatonMode
[6:17:31] Quethal: Reduce Aoe damage by %75
[6:17:33] Quethal: Fixed
[6:17:33] Genghish: Yep
[6:17:38] Fotbee: guys are there any mage healers in the chat? How to make good hps logs? I do 90+ dps but my hps is greeeeeen. running regen on the chest only
[6:17:39] slowshi: wtf am I watching
[6:17:40] gudastv: they should delete this shitty boss, remove it completely
[6:17:41] 1shabbymn: make it so you get the same number of bloods if you're close to the boss or not
[6:17:43] heisann96: its better than the gy farm
[6:17:46] madamedog: just give everyone 3x the blood, anywhere, not 3x near the boss
[6:17:48] iBanEvader: @Xaryu you got enoguh inventory space?
[6:17:49] panzmat: this really needs to be fixed
[6:17:49] stokes_t: Problem is any hot fix will likely make it much harder to get bloods
[6:17:50] nerdymaestro: Easy fix: make it so you don't get bloods when standing near an altar
[6:17:50] SailazarAY: just put 1 min cd on altar for turning in
[6:17:54] chetterbancettv: love you xar, but this aint glory
[6:17:54] egrounds: What mount do you get?
[6:17:54] coldsarsparilla: Xaryu do you ever get news about Minnesota where you live? if yes, what do they say? Seems like everything has been normal here but wonder what other states say about us
[6:17:55] mrbluesky1337: just saying as a mage with both moutns i felt offended LUL
[6:17:55] Philopinos: calling it now, ur gona be 1 silver off
[6:17:56] ledpredatorx: blizz doesnt play their own game so they dont know whats meta
[6:17:58] nmitchell219: you are the promoter of it
[6:17:58] beyondwarr: @xaryu why you dont use the staf
[6:18:03] morfius09: immunity around altar
[6:18:07] Mahca_: glad you can’t be novad after res now at least
[6:18:09] SailazarAY: or 2 min
[6:18:11] Varjant: remove blood from around the altar
[6:18:12] xxx_fat_x_al_xxx: everything this phase is a disaster
[6:18:19] Duokkis: Make it so that whenever you die near altar you get a stacking debuff that reduces you coin gains
[6:18:19] timmys7f: @Fotbee All my 99 logs have very low dps. You just focus on keeping Temp Beacon on everyone and keeping AB stacks low while still casting as often as possible
[6:18:20] jandoodle2: this tauren is out of line
[6:18:24] Snorlax_King: @ledpredatorx they dont have to play it when everybody cries about it XD
[6:18:29] chircan05: heyy
[6:18:32] heisann96: how many coins u getting per event ?
[6:18:33] jandoodle2: monteOpa
[6:18:34] stokes_t: This phase does seem rushed and snoopy
[6:18:36] stokes_t: Sloppy
[6:18:43] h0t_sauce7: EZ
[6:18:43] NamerBomber: people are running in cuz they do not want to lose on death and there is a max on what you can carry
[6:18:44] Ink0gnit0_1200: perhaps they could promote other points of interest for those who DONT wanna do this
[6:18:47] mookerBL: i think this phase is super fun
[6:18:47] chircan05: is this game cool?
[6:18:51] BlownFuse_: this is way worse than p1 imo
[6:18:51] yellowgaiden: disaster?
[6:18:51] mogg_chill: 50 silvers per run you said ????
[6:18:55] enigmasvea: p1 is a joke in comparison
[6:18:57] yellowgaiden: iplayed so much more p2
[6:18:58] NamerBomber: mages should not be able to do this they need to fix that
[6:19:01] Fotbee: @timmys7f so should I run mass regen then? if yes should I change chest regen to smth else?
[6:19:03] wick3l: Did gnomer reset with patch?
[6:19:06] largist_: there should be some reason to fight on altar where boss not present, would help folk to spread oute
[6:19:08] stokes_t: P1 > P2
[6:19:10] WonderfulTimes: i think this is just a transition get leveled phase for there level 50 phase. Thats what it feels like
[6:19:14] yellowgaiden: boomkins shamans, alot of people can do this
[6:19:17] iBanEvader: this phase is better but the timing was wrong @Xaryu
[6:19:18] largist_: or maybe two bosses on zone
[6:19:19] Blide: this is crazy, I wish my poor warrior could get remotely close to this lol
[6:19:21] iBanEvader: phaes 1 took way too long
[6:19:21] WonderfulTimes: 50 seems to be way more content being added
[6:19:21] enigmasvea: cant even compare p1 to p2, p2 blows it out of the water so easy
[6:19:22] Nimbus723: start a bit outside of alter imo
[6:19:22] Famewar: 800 more
[6:19:27] Varjant: same
[6:19:28] bigcaptain8: p2 way better
[6:19:29] lecrabTV: funneling the entire zone to one spot in stv is a little goofy
[6:19:30] Riji07: i kinda liked p1 more than p2
[6:19:31] timmys7f: @Fotbee To parse, mass regen legs and burnout chest
[6:19:32] Famewar: or 600 haha maths

[6:19:43] spiritsland: sodcore for p2?
[6:19:50] xpredicts: What about changing the cap on blood you can have to avoid the need to turn in?
[6:19:52] Knocktoff: when is sodcore coming back speaking of?
[6:19:53] b1azzuris: you were still playing p1 at this point its only been 3 weeks lol
[6:19:53] mellven: remove all blood gains within 100 yards of an alter or reduce blood gains for multiple of the same class per group
[6:19:57] alrik_plays: @Snorlax_King When did we have Gnome Raid and BFD Raid before?
[6:19:59] lolzandis: P2 is better bu they need to add more like a new class/race or zone
[6:19:59] Reaperz_kinetic: @snorlax_king we’ve already had 2 new raids dude 😂
[6:20:03] inhaledthc: @spiritsland real question here ;]

[6:20:11] iBanEvader: Blizzard just has no clue how to make a fun PvP event or class balance
[6:20:11] Duokkis: Make it so that whenever you die near altar you get a stacking debuff that reduces you coin gains 󠀀
[6:20:13] kaizen421: @Snorlax_King its going to be sunken temple 100%

[6:21:43] koooosy: no im sitting on the wall look
[6:21:48] swidey221: they could fix this by not losing blood by dying so people don’t fight on altar @xaryu
[6:21:55] mogg_chill: @Xaryu  50 silvers per run can you do ???

[6:22:42] ledpredatorx: make it a BG lol

[6:22:44] vhrvt: @xaryu is there a clip already of kel kill on hc from horde?

[6:23:06] Ink0gnit0_1200: It would be funny to have a group of hunters all targeting off of one of them just sniping mages
[6:23:09] Reaperz_kinetic: @unrulypeasant based on that convo the only loser living a sad life is you
[6:23:11] Erki_OW: nerf bloodcoin gain near altar
[6:23:11] celestius11: make it so theres no altar and you lose coins on death and you keep what you have at the end

[6:23:37] PhokingTV_: or a max of 2 per party
[6:23:38] rollinsthechamp: @PhokingTV_ maybe duplicate but not 5 of 1 class
[6:23:38] ObrezKnight: ashenvale could be great, if you focused on defending with a smaller squad, usually winning the whole thing
[6:23:45] Nimbus723: 150 more?
[6:23:45] PhokingTV_: yea no more than 2 of each class ina party
[6:23:45] zerozuckerl: do you get coins in stv by just tagging or does your team have to get the kill?

I talked to some guy who was convinced there's an alien invasion in minnesota so im kind of confused if im not hearing real news or something. i live in minnesota and everything is normal?
[6:24:17] SunYuHong: but if everyone sits on the edge, then nobody dies and it becomes worse for everyone
[6:24:19] Slickrub: Hear me out, 5v5 battle royale wz style, more points for placing higher. This would be so much fun.

[6:31:06] EasyPeasley: They wont let you turn in the honor tokens next phase LUL takes an intern 30 seconds to fix that  󠀀
[6:31:07] PhokingTV_: just keep saving honor
[6:31:11] heisann96: a month ago when i did this 250coins was a good run for me on rogue
[6:31:16] PhokingTV_: ull never get honor this easy again might aswell save it @Xaryu
[6:31:17] jackpepsimba: @HugzGG the person youre responding to had a dumb take, but this take is only slightly less dumb/in touch with reality
[6:31:21] teriko_: hero class
[6:31:22] davisjones_: is it even funny to farm like this ?
[6:31:25] AchillezHeals: so only 255 per event?
[6:31:26] SarcasticApe: @Xaryu Hmm u gonna get the ugly saber or the giga raptor ?
[6:31:28] adam_brisbane: people spread out to much
[6:31:28] wrathbest: we did 5k no worries
[6:31:32] Varjant: that would be cool
[6:31:33] espi: on low pop servers / after p2 that would spread out players WAY too much
[6:31:34] celestius11: that was my suggestion... make it so you cant turn in coins til the end
[6:31:35] xNotorietyx: @Xaryu they can patch it after im exalted
[6:31:35] angelc843: So reduce the % you lose and remove the cap
[6:31:37] arieuh: saying it now when you got your coins
[6:31:39] arieuh: lmao
[6:31:41] ddraggbagg: Would also make it DR how many you can get
[6:31:45] Littleboosts: you say that after getting 2723 coins in 30 mins
[6:31:45] asapovx_madi: How many did you get?
[6:31:47] warpot0305: let people turn in as a ghost
[6:31:49] shaydaan_tn: what i said, start at 2500 and stay alive, then turn in
[6:31:50] Blockaaattv: @arieuh thats what im sayin
[6:31:50] thamysticog: just delete this event already
[6:31:52] Smitana92: its already too late, ppl will be mad if they fix it after everybody got a free mount
[6:31:53] idiotferaltko: @PhokingTV_ Stop telling him to get honor...it will do nothing in P3...u can not horde honor tokens for next phase
[6:31:57] ayaooazz: he was saying it before
[6:31:59] jackpepsimba: How does the mage aoe strat make the event worse, chat?
[6:32:00] cptnkuroky: just let the mages have their coins its whatever imo
[6:32:00] v1ll4n0us: it doesn't need to be fixed
[6:32:02] espi: you have to keep in mind you're playing on the Megaserver
[6:32:03] joonelius3: it would make guilds etc boosting each other super fast.
[6:32:04] bag_jones_: its bannable
[6:32:05] PhokingTV_: how do u know @idiotferaltko
[6:32:07] Littleboosts: #nochanges lol
[6:32:08] joonelius3: if there is no limit
[6:32:09] tazewell: Some chatters on Twitch literally do not have logic
[6:32:10] Austeezy: hi mom! im icebergslim
[6:32:10] shadowvypers: They could cap at 1k, no loss on death, no turnin til end
[6:32:10] f4a_tony: Have a 15 second debuff after res, that doesnt let you give bloods till it wears off
[6:32:14] idiotferaltko: ....look at p2 they did the exact same thing lol
[6:32:15] iambeautifull_: !server
[6:32:15] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[6:32:15] Drinkin2drinks: Drinkin2drinks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[6:32:16] Mahca_: another xar exploit video inc Keepo
[6:32:16] PhokingTV_: hording honor turn ins is bis
[6:32:19] swidey221: why do it if you don’t agree with it?
[6:32:20] HugzGG: @jackpepsimba that proposed solution created another problem what about that is out of touch
[6:32:20] idiotferaltko: blizzard does not like people hording things
[6:32:23] Velius_Grey: but isn't the intent of the event to be super chaotic and brutal?
[6:32:25] iBanEvader: @Xaryu true the event will still be popular in later phases also
[6:32:26] thamysticog: now that youre done they can fix it haha
[6:32:26] joonelius3: so no limit=ppl would exploit by killing friends.
[6:32:27] EasyPeasley: @PhokingTV_ they literally did it with WSG marks LUL
[6:32:28] Morkaa: @f4a_tony Already has that lol
[6:32:30] SippinSimpSyrup: no
[6:32:35] bag_jones_: who uses exploits they will be perma banned
[6:32:36] PhokingTV_: wsg marks were because of exp @EasyPeasley
[6:32:37] jackpepsimba: Thinking that the world pvp free for all event needs to be perfectly balanced is one of the worst takes this community has had
[6:32:37] broopyd: @swidey221 do you agree with child labour? bet you still own an iphone or android
[6:32:38] stormlightcookie: exploiter Xar at it again Kappa
[6:32:38] f4a_tony: @Morkaa  after that lol
[6:32:40] SippinSimpSyrup: if you cant hand in until the end there should be no loss on death
[6:32:40] Seline88: How many coins total this run?
[6:32:40] Blide: unless youre a warrior
[6:32:41] iBanEvader: I hate the loss on death
[6:32:47] a_cray0n: literally stops no one from wanting to die
[6:32:48] monaad_ttv: lose half on death
[6:32:49] foxwinkle: Another problem:  if you fix it now people who haven't grind STV yet will complain
[6:32:49] chobinhood_: problem with loss on death is there is no loss if you fight on an altar
[6:32:50] angelc843: "WhY dO iT iF yOu dOnT aGrEe" Its wow stop being so political and just play
[6:32:50] zebercetanayurt: ok let's be real then, how is it irrelevant when you stream this soft colliding meta to 5k ppl
[6:32:51] doctor_anoos: Mages are starting to sell 'Blood Moon Carries' for gold.
[6:32:51] jallaballan: yeah remove limit and keep 10% loss on death
[6:32:52] ZombieQueenElizabeth: as a healer i dont like the loss on death
[6:32:54] idiotferaltko: bro they will not let ppl horde honor tokens and get instant rank in p3...use ur brain lmao
[6:32:57] Denzax: loss on death is so bad for melees tho
[6:33:01] PhokingTV_: they will
[6:33:03] morfius09: reward being spread out in some way
[6:33:04] TMMOOF: yee remove loss on death
[6:33:05] Anderzonx: @broopyd what other phone options are there?
[6:33:05] Erki_OW: maybe a 2 min cd before you can turn in again
[6:33:10] Khosi7: so many warriors crying in chat, it is so funny :)
[6:33:12] Snorlax_King: people really dont like it when you do this event lol they need to grow up tbh
[6:33:12] Plokoon100: are you drinking diarrhea?
[6:33:21] SippinSimpSyrup: the fact that you can get AB rep from this event is really stupid
[6:33:24] alexrose7: KEK
[6:33:25] monaad_ttv: lose half on death will result in people actually trying to stay alive while pvp
[6:33:28] banshay3: what did that hunter expect?
[6:33:39] jackpepsimba: @HugzGG because melee hunters camping the altar would not happen. that is an "I dont ever pvp" take
[6:33:40] PhokingTV_: its to late to fix the event
[6:33:42] PhokingTV_: just let it be
[6:33:48] DiddiThe1: Got a whoping 91 coins Pog
[6:33:55] Plokoon100: We need a 5 warrior Meta.. but how
[6:33:56] Plaguethong: !addons
[6:33:56] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[6:33:56] foxwinkle: don't hate the gamer!
[6:33:57] Flex85: remove the double token, it wont be so stacked
[6:33:59] broopyd: @Anderzonx There are a few green branded mobile phones
[6:34:01] bag_jones_: blizzard can stop just ban who does exploit the game
[6:34:05] sand_pump: i cant see how mages ruin it hoenstly
[6:34:07] zebercetanayurt: gamers are not gonna game by finding optimal way
[6:34:09] Genghish: We are the bots now
[6:34:14] land__shark_: isnt that just exploiting? which is tos?
[6:34:14] ThisisMaintv: dont fault the gamer, fault the game
[6:34:15] Phrosted_: kills from aoe damage dont give blood ez pz
[6:34:15] thotfull_: Mages* are going to find ways lol
[6:34:20] TMMOOF: maybe some sort of debuff for groups in stv with more than 2 of the same class?
[6:34:20] Missingiscool: almost every horrible gaming experience is the devs fault
[6:34:21] kaizen421: dont hate the player hate the game
[6:34:21] bag_jones_: Xar why are you malding hard?
[6:34:22] PhokingTV_: 5 boomkin meta to 5 Spriest meta to 5 mage meta
[6:34:22] Blockaaattv: Thats like saying the optimal way to farm is fly hacking, and until blizz fix's it you will do it... No you will not stoop down that level
[6:34:23] swidey221: they’re just gonna find a new optimal way, this has happened several times already since p2 launched @xaryu
[6:34:24] x_vyn_: dont hate the player, hate the game :)
[6:34:24] Tels: don't hate the playa, hate the game
[6:34:29] PhokingTV_: 5 boomkin meta to 5 Spriest meta to 5 mage meta WHO IS NEXT!
[6:34:30] HugzGG: @jackpepsimba who said anything about melee hunters? i dont see that in my message, if you make the altar reflect or reduce spells then NORMAL hunters/melee would just camp the altar and be magic immune
[6:34:33] PhokingTV_: 5 WARRIORS IS NEXT META!
[6:34:33] unbreakepad: what happened to you xaryu? you look 10 years younger
[6:34:34] asloff: HOLY SHIT IT'S FUCKING TIGER TIME BOIS!!!!!!
[6:34:34] Sollidie: Each time you turn in blood - % stats debuff
[6:34:35] Yonyret: Ur so hot with short hair @Xaryu
[6:34:36] HigashiGG: well put gamer
[6:34:37] Plokoon100: They shuld put a debuff that slowly satcks teh longer you sit on the alter
[6:34:39] Vio9: yeah it will happen every time lol
[6:34:40] madamedog: @Xaryu give the extra blood to everyone, not just around the boss, so everyone gets alot where ever they are and its gonna nerf the altar spam at only 1 spot
[6:34:41] alexgoat94: dont hate the game hate the playa
[6:34:41] AbyssReborn: it aint so common anymore
[6:34:44] bag_jones_: Xar but u dont have to mald over here
[6:34:46] PhokingTV_: 5 WARRIORS LETS GO
[6:34:46] Weddzz: Just a couple of weeks ago you had 5x SPs spamming overpowered sh death, it is what it is.
[6:34:46] EasyPeasley: trying to fully prevent Classic WoW players from min maxing is a losing battle
[6:34:47] shadowvypers: they need to speed up the coin conversion
[6:34:51] bassey_: 5 warlock meta
[6:34:53] yami_yugi_87: 1 class per group
[6:34:55] BrokenClipsZ: nerf warriors until everyone rerolled and there is 0 warriors left
[6:34:56] PhokingTV_: 5 DEVESTATE WARRIOR METa
[6:34:56] iBanEvader: 5 rogue meta @Xaryu
[6:34:56] koooosy: we run 2 boomies with WG, disc priest, fire mage and meta lock
[6:34:57] zebercetanayurt: nice short terk perspective
[6:34:58] YuraruY: when in doubt, nerf hunters

[6:35:05] Skiban123: pvp in sod is still trash imo
[6:35:06] davisjones_: this is what makes wow worst and worst. this way of thinking may seem logical but it is just garbage
[6:35:07] awsdlife: How did you get some many coins?!?!
[6:35:08] Snorlax_King: @Blockaaattv your actually brain dead. fly hacking is bannable. grouping up with 5mages isnt
[6:35:11] asloff: SABERTOOTH POGGERS
[6:35:13] Ryzehx: unhinged chat today

[6:35:22] xpume: Put 1 minute cd on delivering tokens> prob solved
[6:35:23] tomzi1: make the coins bind on account so everyone is forced to mage :D
[6:35:25] alexrose7: Imagine being a rogue
[6:35:26] taylorsdank: why cant weee bee friends
[6:35:26] iBanEvader: @Xaryu I hope you are going to buy the raptor
[6:35:29] taylorsdank: why cant weee be friends
[6:35:30] jackpepsimba: mage strat only makes the event good for mages, it doesnt make the event bad for others. You only go near the altar when you need to turn in blood
[6:35:31] blazzedzz: Nerf class stacking
[6:35:36] KosmicDevil_: @iBanEvader you will be disappointed
[6:35:39] ggbr0sky: there is a meta for evry class
[6:35:42] jallaballan: 5 ench shaman is new meta outside of altar aoe
[6:35:42] iBanEvader: @KosmicDevil_ oh no
[6:35:44] bag_jones_: is xar on his period?
[6:35:45] 77courtjester77: Optimal way to farm gold is to use your mom's credit card
[6:35:46] Yonyret: @Xaryu Everytime when I'm watching you and your stream I gotta remove my cloth you warm me inside so much
[6:35:49] smol_monkey_man: LMAO hacking the game is the same as mage aoe??
[6:35:52] Knocktoff: decent allegory
[6:35:52] xpredicts: I think it's up to the person to decide to use something that is clearly cheese strat. But at that point it's a moral decision.
[6:35:53] smol_monkey_man: what are people saying
[6:35:54] alemuncher: well its the most optimal one though..
[6:35:54] PhokingTV_: PAY A MAGE

[7:04:46] CodeRedOG: @plae007 okay, I don’t feel like going to deep into it. it being less that 1% just says common sense that it’s wrong. but I do hear what you’re saying
[7:04:48] llnikon: lets say you have +5 frost and +5 fire dmg, does frostfire count as +5 or +10
[7:04:49] plae007: @plae007 so if i do 1000 damage and dismantle does 10 damage throughout the fight. its 1%.  so thats basically 100% right? thats your logic
[7:04:50] disar27: yeckabear wants to duelllllll go yeckabear
[7:04:51] therealzugzugzugs: 50g

[7:35:47] adam_brisbane: warriors can go to classic era if they want to be the best
[7:35:47] catffeine_live: If you raise the bottom instead of nerfing the top you create power creep and a one-shot meta.
[7:35:48] SmashTheDude: misses in pvp as a warrior are the worst

[7:36:11] sukkerfugl: Give warriors spell reflect on a 20 sec cd
[7:36:13] glowz92: the fact that rogue sux against mage does not mean it sux against everything else
[7:36:13] MatiRey88: if we keep buffing they will need to do moobs with 4M of life on MC @Xaryu  KEK

[7:36:48] teachzin: 1 frostbite and u dont even need to block against roguesd
[7:36:48] ned71cro: but none of those great classes can beat mage
[7:36:48] iPlayCuzFun: well played
[7:36:48] nwacompton: yes
[7:36:48] cabo_chris: warriors should hit diminishing returns a lot faster

[7:36:50] InnsaiyanTV: @Xaryu Then you get a game where you just stomp every quest and mob, thats not the calssic experience 󠀀

[7:36:57] iPlayCuzFun: tbh you are a multi rank 1 mage
[7:36:57] csant1023: try not using living flame.
[7:36:58] TheBeaverQueen: warriors are DEFINITELY getting done dirty

[7:37:00] ggbr0sky: no more buffs nerf all
[7:37:00] Geographic3rd: Mages need a nerf ,rogues and warriors need a buff
[7:37:01] Cerec_: mages are in their own league cuz they have a heal now. Imagine giving rogue a heal they could press at all times
[7:37:01] maxwell_rs3: living flame need bigger cooldown
[7:37:02] notoriousz: did u say warriors good?
[7:37:05] notoriousz: KEKW
[7:37:05] snarfqt: holy shit i cant even watch sod streams the pvp is unreal garbage
[7:37:05] Alassianss: @pwnage4me4free u can buff warriors in pvp without touching pve like give them 3 charges  of charge useable in combat, make rage be used in cc to remove fear sheep etc. theres alot they can do to touch warriors in pvp
[7:37:07] Stingin: warriors need more self healing abilities
[7:37:08] Kira_Corpse: i think mage is obviously a hard counter to any melee... but thats about it
[7:37:10] Grosmurdefeu: rogue need cloack of shaman and crimson vial xD

[7:37:16] BeeMcG: @Xaryu if mages couldnt heal to full with chrono its abit more fair
[7:37:16] notoriousz: ah yeah
[7:37:17] romanisroamin: the full heal changes things quite a bit
[7:37:17] helloimbob28: @Xaryu PALADINS SUCK
[7:37:17] jellymann: warriors need leap
[7:37:18] Grosmurdefeu: cloack of shadows
[7:37:21] DanicksTV: Warrior is shit unless you are Sonii then you make it work @Xaryu
[7:37:21] val_blank: @Xaryu rogues are not underperforming lol, maybe against mages
[7:37:24] xJmoh: I mean allow fap in that fight and everything changes
[7:37:25] LassyTTV: no maybes about rouges they are def underperforming
[7:37:26] jaeger4kd: Rogues definitely kill most other class' 1v1 .. Ur looking through the optics of mage
[7:37:27] ImThatFella: Are you talking only pvp or pve as well?
[7:37:29] flippo_88: ya but game is more than just duels tbf
[7:37:30] lminar: @Xaryu how is warlock in pvp?
[7:37:30] collinss17: good for pve or pvp?
[7:37:32] nolanjruss2324: why balance the game around 1v1 lol
[7:37:33] SelWrynn: Warriors are top dps on first 2 bosses, isk bout PvP tho
[7:37:33] tmacd: duel in greys and see
[7:37:35] petewack: bobka is theorycrafting hard on how your spec of mage can be beaten
[7:37:38] thejawnny: try playing another classes versus a rogue lol
[7:37:41] yapercaper: feral are underperforming too imo
[7:37:42] totally_fine: warriors now have spells reflect?
[7:37:42] Faepi: Absolutely
[7:37:44] DanicksTV: YES THIS
[7:37:45] uhoee: if they add cloak of shadow, im not playing the game anymore
[7:37:46] Jaysmoke: whats crazy is i watch bobka easy take out 2-4 people all the time in open world pvp
[7:37:46] veiloflonelystars: same
[7:37:46] blazzedzz: Bro rogues are just fine against anything other then mage
[7:37:46] YuraruY: @Stingin nah if u start doing that every class that doesnt have self healing will start asking for one and there wont be a class fantasy anymore
[7:37:46] Rainey719: I think warriors will scales up is all
[7:37:48] incognito_enjoyer: I can't wait until mage gets displacement !!!! Displacement is going to be so fun
[7:37:48] BenThel: shamans are not that good, ele is only good if not focused
[7:37:48] notoriousz: 100% true
[7:37:48] Austinnmh: Thats only cause you main PvP though
[7:37:51] sand_pump: warriors dont own in PVE tho @Xaryu
[7:37:51] veiloflonelystars: that ads diversity of play 100%
[7:37:52] itskigz: wars not even top 3 in pve
[7:37:52] Zambuu: that can be okay
[7:37:52] iPlayCuzFun: warriors is not a specc tho
[7:37:53] probeu: agree
[7:37:53] xJmoh: I mean allow fap in that fight and everything changes, right?
[7:37:55] ZipperLUL: One spec, the whole class sucks at pvp though
[7:37:57] notoriousz: thats how it should be
[7:37:57] maniiieelll: but all warriors spec suck for pvp
[7:37:59] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: what if they are the best in both
[7:37:59] Genghish: Nope, all classes should be viable in pvp
[7:38:01] Zambuu: but they should be okay in raids or vice versa
[7:38:01] sukkerfugl: So warrior is just one spec, but mage can have more than one spec? @Xaryu
[7:38:02] MalwareBaby: Well yeah but you play a mage and like to PvP xD
[7:38:04] OfficialUknoww: i perfer tht
[7:38:06] jaeger4kd: @sand_pump They will
[7:38:06] Its_big_t: that’s their whole point
[7:38:07] Riji07: must suck being a warrior who plays pvp though
[7:38:08] Alassianss: @pwnage4me4free another thing example is when u charge u get 40% movement speed buff for 4 secounds would be good too,  spell reflect, stuff like that :)
[7:38:08] BeeMcG: but warriors suck in all specs in pvp xaryu
[7:38:10] cabo_chris: a warrior isn’t a spec. it’s a whole class
[7:38:10] Carpenterhill: u say spec, but warriors is not a spec ;)
[7:38:11] ggbr0sky: what specc dont suck pvp from warrior? KEKW
[7:38:14] blazzedzz: I don't think they should balance the game around mages
[7:38:16] callexy95: Warriors are gr8 in grps
[7:38:19] MalwareBaby: Well yeah but you play a mage and like to PvP
[7:38:19] YuraruY: @sukkerfugl wdym 1 spec, u can tank and dps
[7:38:23] Truthseeker96: @petewack one shot em with cold blood and good cc. counter his trinket/dots with blind. never let the mage open
[7:38:28] molti96: they should just lower the gnomeregan armor rates and problem is solved @Xaryu
[7:38:28] Ervill1: In vanilla yes, but this is sod and blizzard clearly attempts balance
[7:38:28] legiterate: I agree but every spec should have a place no?
[7:38:29] nekzuslord: cata in a nutshell
[7:38:31] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: and then you can't have the memer dreamers
[7:38:31] Riji07: I agrree man um but should not have c or d tier classes though
[7:38:33] Genghish: Warrior is a whole class dude imagine no mage spec was viable in pvp
[7:38:36] rickksen: fair
[7:38:37] mf_travis: !talents
[7:38:37] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[7:38:38] moneyshotx_: bad take
[7:38:41] maniiieelll: which war spec is good for pvp then?
[7:38:41] csant1023: Try one round w/o Living Flame
[7:38:42] weeedzygg: @Xaryu SP are top dpsing and also are a PVP based spec !!
[7:38:43] SelWrynn: what do arcane mages do?
[7:38:45] halogenada: that guy dont stop jumping ? lol
[7:38:46] Zambuu: there should be clear winners and losers, but if you have enough skill those lines so be easily blurred more
[7:38:46] coolcoolcool777dood: how do i use my twitch prime?
[7:38:51] GrimGrimGrim: Warrior could use some defensive layers tho, but not healing
[7:38:51] sukkerfugl: You just compared the full class warrior, to one of three specs of mage @Xaryu
[7:38:51] wreckstormx: warr is top dps on first 2 bosses at least
[7:38:54] ned71cro: that's totally correct opinion, cos it's impossible to make a single class viable in both pvp and pve
[7:38:54] incognito_enjoyer: I can't wait until mage gets displacement !!!! Displacement is going to be so fun
[7:38:54] cabo_chris: there has never been a viable spec for warriors in duels
[7:38:57] weeedzygg: @Xaryu SP are top dpsing and also are a PVP based spec
[7:38:58] rickksen: sv hnter
[7:38:58] iPlayCuzFun: but warrior is still not a specc... :p
[7:38:58] tmacd: and 1 v1 is different than mass pvp
[7:38:58] bbqchicknboi: which warr spec is good for pvp
[7:38:59] Nebulas2: it should be more about style
[7:39:00] sgohst: i agree but having d tier classes is not OK
[7:39:00] Humble_Student: feral's place is windfury buff bot
[7:39:01] Pr1m0x21: what is that enchant on rouge daggers?
[7:39:03] turkelton_97: @SelWrynn i guess healing
[7:39:04] catffeine_live: Ferals are kings of ST, Boomies are kings of AoE
[7:39:10] newworlder229: how is paladin at the top tho?
[7:39:16] sukkerfugl: You just compared the full class warrior, to one of three specs of mage @Xaryu  󠀀
[7:39:18] rickksen: i sucking family friendly?
[7:39:19] Alassianss: @newworlder229 top buffer :)
[7:39:21] hunchurio: pvp in classic just seems so one dimensional
[7:39:22] BeeMcG: warriors suck in all specs for pvp
[7:39:22] Xquisit_TV: Xar joining the MOVE?
[7:39:26] Genghish: You wouldnt say the same if mages were weak in pvp, warriors deserve to take less dmg in pvp
[7:39:33] rickksen: @Xaryu is sucking family friendly?
[7:39:34] Jaysmoke: we need DUAL SPEC!
[7:39:34] SelWrynn: Warriors own first 2 bosses in gnomer
[7:39:37] fritsx1312: if so then gife us duelspec
[7:39:40] newworlder229: @Alassianss ye, thats what i thought
[7:39:40] JoaEUW: Thats why classic PvP is really fun. It's rock paper scissors. Unfortunately there's phases atm in SOD and it just automatically changed how good a class is depending if its 40 50 or 60. Warriors will probably smash later on with good gear
[7:39:43] Qdpal: @catffeine_live how are boomkins king of aoe?
[7:39:44] MatiRey88: thats why they should add dual spec @Xaryu
[7:39:45] Sk0pps: !server
[7:39:46] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[7:39:46] catffeine_live: @sukkerfugl Warriors are one spec
[7:39:49] ImThatFella: But druids can do everything
[7:39:50] aadeBirger: @Genghish less damage in pvp?? why?
[7:39:52] blazzedzz: Warrior are great dps in raid...?
[7:39:57] Beunhaase: No false news
[7:40:00] catffeine_live: @Qdpal I'm thinking of retail. I don't know much about Classic balance.
[7:40:01] ZipperLUL: Not now they're not
[7:40:02] teachzin: @Xaryu mage is the worst class to lvl up, do u agree ?
[7:40:02] maniiieelll: so they are not good
[7:40:03] FurylordD: @blazzedzz warriors are meh in pve honestly
[7:40:04] iPlayCuzFun: if they made armor take less magic dmg that would be great...
[7:40:04] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Warrior+Hpala Pocket Healer=Ownage
[7:40:05] YuraruY: also warriors on PVE are busted af
[7:40:06] ZipperLUL: They don't do any damage
[7:40:12] Beunhaase: Warriors in PVP are bad even in BG's imagine AV only thing that matters is AOE
[7:40:13] JohnnyBokelo_: they good if u spend 10g in consumables per bg
[7:40:13] Qdpal: @catffeine_live gotcha
[7:40:22] aadeBirger: I think he compared a warrior in BFA to SOD
[7:40:24] notoriousz: @YuraruY check out top100 dps in Gnomeregan, theres 1 warr
[7:40:27] Its_big_t: @xaryu I spent 3 hours looking for a group for gnomer as a dps warrior.. call me dumb but NO ONE would bother to inv.
[7:40:30] Wallscast: beat bobka without using ICE BARRIER
[7:40:36] YuraruY: @notoriousz there's also only 1 hunt and ppl still say hunt is op
[7:40:37] lminar: @Xaryu how is warlock in pvp?
[7:40:38] T_Tfail: talk about Feral PvP
[7:40:40] ItsTavyy: tbh i doubt blizzard puts much thought into balancing around duels
[7:40:41] unik3v2: Give them thunderclap and reflect
[7:40:42] incognito_enjoyer: I can't wait until mage gets displacement rune is P3!!!! Displacement is going to be so fun for
[7:40:48] ripwarlock2: Just play a warlock and be good at everything
[7:40:48] arowec: What is the player frame addon?
[7:40:49] kimchikid69: None one talks about Feral PvP in SoD Lol
[7:40:49] moneyshotx_: imagine having to use consumes to be viable
[7:40:50] 00Absurd: BIG AGREE
[7:40:53] BroodingDoob: @FurylordD false, average warriors are meh. skilled warriors are very strong in raid
[7:40:54] moilert: this is just p2 tho, once p3 is here who knows whats best. the thing will be to balance it all at 60 imo
[7:40:56] Riji07: ye thats fine it shouldn't bother ppl everybody needs to be more grateful for what they got going
[7:40:58] Endboss1988: what do u think about the duel tournament 3 years ago? In the semi final there was a warrior
[7:41:02] omnipresentbe1ng: displacement inc in p3 Pog
[7:41:05] Ervill1: @its_big_t it's a common issue this phase. I don't play sod anymore because it was more annoying than fun
[7:41:05] ned71cro: dueling is not a major part of the game so who cares :D
[7:41:06] Relyst: if 10% of the pop pvps, its almost a waste of their time to design specs around it
[7:41:06] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: being good at something sounds so cool
[7:41:07] Einarino: I think warriors are bound to be lower tier in SoD as they are like the best class in era
[7:41:09] YuraruY: @notoriousz top 100 dont mean nothing when is full of caster bc of armor values from bosses, but even if u look at just melee specs warr are still rolling the meters
[7:41:14] bbox16: They added a dueling area?
[7:41:14] Einarino: They might not stay there tho
[7:41:14] L0TSI: @notoriousz Check out 3 first bosses
[7:41:15] Jehl703: @xaryu Mages are top dps in PvE. Top in PvP. STV exploiters. Best AoE farmers. ..They're even extremely good healers now. Other than tanking, mages are the best at every aspect of SoD currently. They are absolutely in a league of their own.
[7:41:18] bestofrunescape: when is phase 3?
[7:41:19] Tomix_137: :D
[7:41:27] Steafmaster: Is p3 going to be lvl 60?
[7:41:29] ctrlbeesy: dreading the day sod dies
[7:41:30] notoriousz: @L0TSI is the raid just 3 bosses? xd
[7:41:34] incognito_enjoyer: I can't wait until mage gets displacement rune is P3!!!! Displacement is going to be so fun for
[7:41:41] L0TSI: @notoriousz Nah its 6... So half the raid
[7:41:42] SelWrynn: At least warriors get good itemization, even in SoD devs don't know how to make pally gear
[7:41:43] Truthseeker96: open with sap this time bobka
[7:41:48] Cal_Ki: do what your having fun doing
[7:41:52] wladqz: @Xaryu you have problems to get into ICC group as a warrior, you need trinket for pvp but for ICC progress you are not wanted that much
[7:41:53] Truthseeker96: wait for his shields to drop and be ready on the blind
[7:41:53] Rainey719: rip ssf tonight
