[0:17:19] greenmachine11235: We're at what, week 12 without filling HoF?
[0:17:19] lathander557: You'd think they need to nerf heroic fyrakk because casual retail raiders can't stay after a wipe, it's against the rules
[0:17:19] cendaiii: @Punk611 it will open the week after next
[0:17:37] zlncy: 16 more guilds till crossrealm it seems
[0:17:48] iridae: "We want the importance and integrity of server and guild identity ! "

[0:17:55] Mipolol: iMmeRSioN
[0:17:59] booznoon: is their reasoning that they want mythic raiding to be reserved for guilds
[0:18:00] lathander557: He is easy, I'm just whining that no one can stay in a raid if the kills aren't turbo free
[0:18:01] MooKalti: I assume because they think that people would pay to bring in ringers to get into the Hall of Fame
[0:18:02] booznoon: seems regressive to me
[0:18:02] larkhill: at this point, if they open it early, they'd be admitting they were wrong. and we cant have that
[0:18:08] cendaiii: @cendaiii sorry, we're really trying :( 2% wipe..
[0:18:09] fronkacean: 👀

[0:23:40] Faraday5001: get a neck transplant
[0:23:40] LegacyofTork: the weight of the helmet
[0:23:43] DubHeals: I'll give you my wife's advice to me: have you tried just not having neck pain?
[0:23:47] dango0n: would 2 paladins and a warrior be 2 in the pink 1 in the stink? @Maximum
[0:23:48] Voyburke: like muscle pain or like slight nerve pain?
[0:23:56] Azkrust: Spine stretches too homie. Could be pain unrelated to the neck area
[0:24:05] larkhill: record your sleep and see if youre turning weird
[0:24:06] MaleBanger: buh
[0:24:10] TehWongWay: no i dont sleep
[0:24:12] Ganryu22: is it both sides and does it happen right after exercice?
[0:24:14] jerkmcgee: sometimes need a different pillow
[0:24:16] daiger5o: Neck pains leads to head aches
[0:24:16] tanikins: like the "i can't turn my head" days?
[0:24:18] Mindtrick714: sounds like you need a new pillow.
[0:24:21] Xyphin: Is your stick the right length? You could be bending too far or not enough to reach the puck.
[0:24:24] MizSeekerz: have you been to a chiropractor? your neck might be out
[0:24:25] zannuss: My neck always hurts, but thats cause I am fused from c5-c7 and have bulges from c2-c5
[0:24:28] StupidAussieDrongo: is that 4hpals?
[0:24:34] ForgottenTime: do cool down streaches
[0:24:34] booznoon: feel like hocket is inherently not great for your neck
[0:24:35] daed_16: ripping too many clappers
[0:24:37] Yagr6: @Maximum i know its from when you have a fat piss and your neck sqwiggles at the end that will do it every time
[0:24:41] ForgottenTime: your just cramping up
[0:24:42] Ganryu22: buff neck
[0:24:44] Azkrust: Have you considered a MyPillow?
[0:24:44] ashtontd: Maybe your neck is getting buff
[0:24:51] Hurbob14: so you exercise. its not the pillow. not the bed. not the sleep. youre just broken then
[0:24:51] GhengasKhan: is your room colder than normal? sometimes in colder temps you scrunch your neck in your sleep to "stay warm" happened to me when it gets colder here
[0:24:57] jerkmcgee: chiropractors are quacks
[0:25:01] Mindtrick714: your body is sinking into your mattress but your pillow keeping your head up
[0:25:02] timboslicee_: its DOMS from impact, warm baths or ice packs before sleep will help this the most. its the ligaments in your neck retracting back after exsertion
[0:25:02] 3DeePee: stress?
[0:25:05] Marriak: very good raid diversity
[0:25:05] misran: chiros are not real doctors

[0:25:09] OG_Kawngi: chiro is fake doctor shit
[0:25:09] Joneim: Chiropractors is how you break your back
[0:25:10] Joneim: Fuck that
[0:25:10] zannuss: Could be a bulged disc
[0:25:10] Watermyrain1: Prob should just buy a new neck at this point imo
[0:25:12] Mindtrick714: thinner pillow
[0:25:14] demepunkk: @Maximum is it the back of your neck?
[0:25:15] jonlukk: Can bem your chair, matress... Some specifc exercise always helps
[0:25:15] BlainFace: when the last time you adjusted your helmet
[0:25:21] 407c: go to the wise woman before a chiropractor
[0:25:22] ForgottenTime: it’s not a cramp but if you don’t stretch after hockey your muscles will slowly contract overnight
[0:25:31] larkhill: frost mage Pog

[0:32:12] raseshi: Hello Maxi, new follower here, but been watching you on YT for a while, regarding your neck pain try to put steamed hot towel before and after sleep, if it doeset help try to sleep with no pillow strait on your back for 3 days and see results if nothing helps try to seek medial help.
[0:32:14] Xyphin: (I also play)
[0:32:14] LegacyofTork: Monday night LFR is unironically one of the things I look forward to haha

[0:32:35] OG_Kawngi: is it really hockey if there's no fighting
[0:32:39] iswimfast: why do we need h fyrakk?
[0:32:42] thelamonsauc: playing adult box lacrosse is the fucking worst
[0:32:50] jerkmcgee: amateurs dont need to be playing CTE simulator lol
[0:32:51] ErkyDog: Watching A League players is insane... they're all dudes who played juniors
[0:32:56] thelamonsauc: just smacking and blindsiding
[0:32:57] RupertsRealm: HUH
[0:33:00] Madcatmk02: @Madcatmk02 when it's good it's the best NOT remotely close but can be outshined on some fights
[0:33:03] sale_mance: not enough rets
[0:33:03] OG_Kawngi: great back shots ok

[0:33:26] mctouretteslol: thats called getting old
[0:33:29] timboslicee_: its DOMS from impact, warm baths or ice packs before sleep will help this the most. its the ligaments in your neck retracting back after exsertion
[0:33:43] sednajoan: stretch more before and after workouts..
[0:33:44] zannuss: Could go get an MRI just to be sure, you'd be surprised how fragile necks are

[0:33:55] Hred5: max thoughts on the NFL results?
[0:34:02] daiger5o: Does running speed somewhat transfers into ice speed? Or u could be fast in hockey but not in ground?
[0:34:05] highcard2: lol i guess just look at the ground?
[0:34:12] Xyphin: For a while I had a stick that was too short, caused my neck to absolutely kill on faceoffs and scrims.
[0:34:22] oneifbyland: @Maximum  do you wear helmet? something as simple as that can cause overuse strain if you aren't used to it. no big deal
[0:34:28] dabrink55: Probably need to do some strength excises for your neck.
[0:34:29] 407c: talk to your trainer might be some shit you can do.
[0:34:33] turnsta: every day is nuts
[0:34:40] Drewskee_: @maximum are you Canadian?
[0:34:42] Xyphin: What position do you play?

[0:35:15] ErkyDog: re-released*
[0:35:43] Jimbonez: every pug does that shit i have no idea why
[0:35:47] HavoksThorn: People are so reactionary instead of being proactive.
[0:35:56] planooooooooooooooooooooo: you know why PepeLaugh it's because they don't have the experience to see the perspective from another role so they don't accomodate
[0:35:58] larkhill: they assume you'll push i before that happens, like a good tuesday group

[0:40:18] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Susge what the heck am i watching

[0:40:43] Thirdheaven: case of the mondays
[0:40:51] zeitgeistfr: if there are no seeders, no one can fuck up the seeds :D
[0:40:54] Celestial990: @dothetangoo judging how good a spec is based off of random ppl's performance in a monday night heroic isnt the best idea
[0:40:54] CKBandit: didnt look like raid leader even discussed seeds before pull
[0:41:00] Byggareebob: ilvl is completely fake anyways

[0:44:25] Pallyex53: does that mean we are old? @maximum
[0:44:27] Shragenator: Lmao ofc
[0:44:28] OG_Kawngi: nobody does but it's provocative, gets the people going
[0:44:29] Jazzarus_: Math problems are more understandable
[0:44:29] BatenicYork: Like the ones where they have the funny looking E
[0:44:31] Darkshadows6662: why are we just watching this now?
[0:44:31] larkhill: agdq 2024 streamed only up this year so it seems fine

[0:45:22] beefy_cheez: can my dad play wow with you for your birthday?
[0:45:23] planooooooooooooooooooooo: it's pretty ingenious really, you make an exterior that the majority of your viewerbase can relate with, or fill in the gaps. as long as you're somewhat friendly, people who would be receptive of vtubing are immediate fans
[0:45:23] larkhill: time for the max cameo's

[0:46:50] trickyshot_: uhhhh LUL
[0:46:51] Zircons: people really just want to be with anime girls

[0:47:04] TheBroCrow: those people just have some menty ps
[0:47:06] dothetangoo: We would all cry if we met max
[0:47:07] MeisterChiefX: i think the deeper connection is unfathomable loneliness
[0:47:08] larkhill: its a lot easier to be social with fans when you dont have to worry about them recognizing you on the street and thinking youre friends irl
[0:47:08] SSnut1248: if I met dratnos I'd cry
[0:47:10] nationas: maximumHelpme
[0:47:11] Cycore: vtubing is for people whose personality doesn't do enough to carry the stream but adding a face cam would be a net loss so they opt for a virtual puppet instead to increase engagement
[0:47:14] Insideyourhead84: @Holytronic hahaha
[0:47:14] lathander557: Some demos are just more inclined to put people on a pedestal than others idk
[0:47:16] xxoutkastedxx: @xxoutkastedxx not sure why thats relevant to what hes saying but yes im aware lol
[0:47:17] Aessari: not a deeper connection, sadder people aessarWAH
[0:47:23] planooooooooooooooooooooo: deeper connection is 100% correct, they're a white canvas for the vtuber audience to project on, it is VERY effective
[0:47:23] quai_gg: welcome to getting old, you just dont get things anymore
[0:47:24] Seitz501: What is Parasocial?
[0:47:25] mentoku: they might cry if you ducked them like driney after the race victory
[0:47:30] Krunkle_Sam: I would weep if i met max
[0:47:35] trickyshot_: i'd cry at dorkis vtuber thing
[0:47:38] turnsta: weird take lmao
[0:47:42] BigTrout3: love a good spit swallowing
[0:47:43] SheapRocka: @Maximum influence of japanise idolculture
[0:47:47] shadowreath93: i think its the polar opposite, feel like their personality carries the stream with no actual face cam
[0:47:48] zannuss: yes
[0:47:53] lathander557: I think vtubing is as deep as "weeb shit" that's it
[0:48:00] Jazzarus_: Man I wish the main city allows you to fly around like this, if not youre going to have a huge problem LUL @maximum
[0:48:00] nightst314: they are either overly positive or super edgy
[0:48:04] Camelbak21: I mean you are def trying hook a certain "audience" with vtubing
[0:48:15] Basic_3: @Seitz501 People who think they know you but are just viewers on Twitch. Super one-way friendship relationship.
[0:48:18] kpoopfangirl: why are parasocial taylor swiftfans so normalized
[0:48:22] Xyphin: Maybe for the anonymity?
[0:48:22] Jazzarus_: In TWW I mean
[0:48:30] TheBroCrow: no surprise, people there get mad when idols they follow get in a relationship lol
[0:48:45] lathander557: 100% yes that
[0:48:49] TattersAU: I get doing it as a streamer, but I dont get it from a viewer perspective
[0:48:53] theDirtyon3: @Jazzarus_ you must be new this expac. Mans been doing laps for years
[0:49:00] Basic_3: Idol culture is so icky
[0:49:02] SheapRocka: jep would say so
[0:49:03] planooooooooooooooooooooo: @Camelbak21 yea, and you're not just "into" vtubing, because by virtue of being accepting of that content you would be more likely to be a fanatic superfan
[0:49:18] theDirtyon3: big same
[0:49:30] ink131_: the fanatical shit is just spooky
[0:49:31] theDirtyon3: i hate you tbh @Maximum
[0:49:31] OG_Kawngi: where are the Max stans at
[0:49:37] J_a_m_e_s_bond: So chat, how did we land on playing Only Up if you can't even get the game on steam anymore?
[0:49:41] larkhill: thd is my idol
[0:49:45] Basic_3: That's why every night before I sleep I say "Max is such a bitch" so I know I'm not idolizing you.
[0:49:46] Camelbak21: @planooooooooooooooooooooo all I'm saying is if vtubing can keep some of these people off the streets RarePepe
[0:49:50] nationas: thd is my idol
[0:49:54] PublikPriest: whats up fam

[0:51:08] Xyphin: Add him to the household and share the game with him?
[0:51:12] theDirtyon3: I would say just stop talking about it :)
[0:51:17] HylightShow: cant you set up a family share?
[0:51:21] nemziac: you can use family share mode and gain access to his games w/o having to use his account
[0:51:24] larkhill: just pretend that guy moved to CA all of a sudden. no big deal
[0:51:26] Xyphin: There's a feature somewhere that lets you share games with family.

[0:51:31] OG_Kawngi: i'm reporting to John Steam right now
[0:51:32] nemziac: up to like 7 people
[0:51:36] nationas: my uncle works for steam you are in deep buddy
[0:51:36] Alarius_: only 1875 people watching
[0:51:38] TheBroCrow: max is farming steam login information in discord DMs rn
[0:51:39] mycho_: gaben is a max viewer
[0:51:44] fjord3: GabeN
[0:51:47] NotD4k: gaben is every where
[0:51:52] Camelbak21: Did you talk about the new blizz president yet or
[0:51:52] 心さとみ: gaben for sure is a max viewer
[0:51:59] Syskokidd: My dad is Steam so good luck getting away, criminal.
[0:52:01] kiratheccl: horseboy still an epic name, but it's a dead giveaway if you're doing undercover raids
[0:52:05] shadowreath93: max you should get some boys together to play sons of the forest when it releases
[0:52:18] J_a_m_e_s_bond: Ah, so just got a feeling, I can dig it. Just wasn't sure if there was something new about the game coming out or something.
[0:52:20] theDirtyon3: Chatting Dear Mr Steam, ....
[0:52:26] NoctemMorS: Random WoW question, do you think Blood DKs have moved up to S tier with the leggo and leggo buffs?
[0:52:28] ModestMewtwo21: @Maximum My dad owns steam and he told me its ok, DW
[0:52:30] Dorittolol: my dad is steam what b day gift are you giving him max i saw your youtube video
[0:52:48] Airies11: maximumOld
[0:52:51] lathander557: Shroud is back on the palworld if you want that as a fallback plan
[0:52:57] raizoontv: with hof still not being full do you think they‘ll turbonerf these last 2 bosses, at this rate there would be way less cutting guilds maximumPre
[0:53:11] Basic_3: @NoctemMorS No. They can't do half of what VDH does for mobs or what Pal does for bosses.
[0:53:18] BigTrout3: it's cringe when they don't use something like Authy or any other TOTP token based app
[0:53:22] Zircons: using your phone is a good way to get your shit stolen
[0:53:24] ink131_: nooo dont nerf pls
[0:53:29] NotD4k: no
[0:53:44] regens_: tindral still sucks tho
[0:53:49] NotD4k: I think they will wait for fyrakk nerfs till the next after hof closes
[0:53:49] MeisterChiefX: tindrals a good difficulty currently
[0:53:51] blit_dn: its a heroic boss now
[0:53:52] Petarglio: tindral is quite well balanced after the nerf, I'd say current tindral is about the same as echo after the volcanic heart radius nerf
[0:53:52] friday_exe: they need more players lmao, bosses are fine LUL
[0:53:55] MeisterChiefX: fyrakk is a clunky mess still
[0:53:56] PleaseLessen: P1 is still farming guilds just reaching it now
[0:53:57] ink131_: if they nerf fyrakk i will be in despair
[0:53:57] NoctemMorS: @Basic_3 Dang, oh well i got all the dungeons on 20s anyways so thats good enough for me
[0:54:00] NotD4k: cuz people will OT like crazy if it happens next week
[0:54:02] Zircons: JB needs to kill everything so he can be a free elf
[0:54:02] heisunknown: our guild just wants to dabble in early mythic bosses, and still waiting on cross realm
[0:54:07] erasedpaulski: i mean, alot of those kills are from guilds that have been hardstuck on it for a while though. i think for a new prog guild on tindral its still a relatively difficult fight
[0:54:13] heat31: P2 is super easy. P3 is just getting the initial positioning down
[0:54:24] Basic_3: @NoctemMorS You can get title without being S tier, but you acknowledge you're playing from behind.
[0:54:26] stelfbronco: @maximum do you know when this season ends?
[0:54:30] Punk611: have you talked about the SoO mount deal? Seems stupid to me that people are upset about a reward from 11 years ago lol.
[0:54:30] Spartany25: it might need to get nerfed again. Cause it's guilds 400-1500 now that need to kill it. It's still 200-300 pulls for them
[0:54:44] raizoontv: @maximum as a follow-up it also depends on how long this season is gonna be. Maybe it’s going to end up on the longer end and that’s why no nerfs?
[0:54:47] Keppie__: guilds that are at tindral now will just never stop dying in p1
[0:54:50] TattersAU: 6 months for season 4?
[0:54:53] Dengen88: I think its in march when it ends
[0:55:02] Keppie__: ye
[0:55:04] Jolvii: yeah roughly April
[0:55:20] eddym310: 3 more months is kinda rough
[0:55:22] lathander557: Fresh content drought finna feelbadman
[0:55:26] xxoutkastedxx: next D4 season is april as well they typically dont over lap those too much
[0:55:29] NoctemMorS: @Basic_3 Oh for sure!
[0:55:43] Basic_3: People have stopped playing and cross-realm isn't even open. So rough.
[0:55:46] Xyphin: What position do you play in hockey?
[0:55:46] Jorityxd: we are at 9 % fyrakk and 40% our wipes are in p2
[0:55:51] zannuss: I'd like to stop, but need orange axe

[0:56:20] Mecabeast: did you ever play monster hunter world it had a resurge of popularity not too long ago
[0:56:21] ValinDeUmbra: For your neck pain try chin tuck exercises. They really helped me
[0:56:23] SneakyWoodPecker: interesting how the sentiment around Yberra has seemingly done a 180
[0:56:30] Aspire121: season ending soon and you still can't pug mythic cuz hof is not filled xdd
[0:56:32] Jazzarus_: As a small content creator who would you ask for access to the alpha for TWW?
[0:56:36] Mywiel: VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[0:56:42] eddym310: no new class too
[0:56:44] theDirtyon3: not everyone
[0:56:45] Joneim: Nah
[0:56:48] Hartneydown: that and no new class
[0:56:49] Beebooga: we WHAT
[0:56:50] OG_Kawngi: also no major talent reworks weekly
[0:56:53] blit_dn: everyoen has acess to alpha?
[0:56:54] Midniyt: We watch for the hot takes tho
[0:56:55] theDirtyon3: fair
[0:56:56] songlokdong: @Jazzarus_ blizzard
[0:57:01] thatguycurt97: Beta yeah, Alpha no
[0:57:03] BigTrout3: is someone spam making new accounts to keep get "first message" highlighting for neck pain solutions?
[0:57:09] Jazzarus_: @Jazzarus_ 4Head
[0:57:14] malnourish_: massive amount of ppl will not ever log on beta
[0:57:16] gamunkadunk: wait they are giving beta to all this time around?
[0:57:26] OG_Kawngi: @gamunkadunk you have to pay for deluxe
[0:57:29] surpriseparty20: Most people will play fro like a couple of hours . The content u make I don't think will get less views
[0:57:30] Camelbak21: Do some Mewing
[0:57:31] TheunGaming: alpha probably isnt until what, march?
[0:57:40] misran: alpha is usually super boring anyways.  just super restricted access to like 1 zone at a time
[0:57:46] 心さとみ: its in the epic edition
[0:57:47] OG_Kawngi: omegagiga edition
[0:57:48] AppleseedPlays: arent alphas disclosed for certain games?
[0:57:50] Punk611: I remember a guildy getting DF beta and they had quite playing in S2 of SL...
[0:57:57] friday_exe: p2p+p2p+p2p
[0:58:05] icerasta: You should get an "iron neck". It has been great for keeping my neck strong for my wrestlers
[0:58:05] boiben_: Max do you remember Radsrad ? I was trying to remember a god tank on BFA and was him. Damm i mis that dude
[0:58:10] Beebooga: i thought it was just 3 days
[0:58:11] splashz0r: max you should check out last epoch, it will become ur fav arpg next month
[0:58:20] BigSatchel: @Beebooga It's both
[0:58:30] averageparses: kinky
[0:58:39] Beebooga: @BigSatchel huge
[0:58:42] OG_Kawngi: who tryin to give iron neck
[0:58:48] Punk611: Joe Rogan made it popular
[0:58:49] Basic_3: What's better value, farming Super Rares for 3 extra days, or complaint equity for starting 3 days later?
[0:58:50] planooooooooooooooooooooo: when PoE2 out Madge
[0:58:55] Camelbak21: There's no way they let everyone in once beta opens tho, it's gna be in waves, and some might get screwed over depending on how long it takes to get ppl through the waves
[0:58:55] OG_Kawngi: new diablo patch made it better
[0:58:58] averageparses: lmao
[0:59:00] MisterNioce: Max you got a LOTR opinion? Big fan??
[0:59:03] GhengasKhan: just goto a glory hole and work your neck out easy solution
[0:59:30] antipheonixna: max cant read Sadge
[0:59:36] Alarius_: incoming show haters, i loved it but people shit on it nonstop
[0:59:39] parse219: wanna run some duriels later? @Maximum
[0:59:54] heisunknown: i think theres definitely some good upperback/neck exercises that can keep things flexible/strong
[1:00:06] Sleikjo: @Maximum Hi my dad was my steam and he watched your youtube video what should I get him?
[1:00:07] Byggareebob: you can prob kill rares
[1:00:07] Joneim: I did 30 Duriels earlier and got jack shit
[1:00:09] Dorittolol: just lvl 5 characters during those 3 days
[1:00:10] friday_exe: we need a lotr game something like what hogwards was
[1:00:11] mycho_: The super rare gear is dead as soon as m0 opens i dont think it matters
[1:00:11] Lara_TV_: I like the 3 days, I just think it should be baseline
[1:00:12] planooooooooooooooooooooo: if anything it should ease server loads
[1:00:12] TheBroCrow: it's shit
[1:00:12] zannuss: Just more time to get alts leveled
[1:00:16] Penicillin17: maybe it will fix the inevitable server issues
[1:00:17] Aggarnar: its gonna be good for the people that wanna play multiple chars at launch
[1:00:25] AppleseedPlays: it could ruin AH early game lol
[1:00:26] MeisterChiefX: its actually disgusting
[1:00:26] Rugburn__: @Maximum check out the Hydra-Gym Neck Machine on youtube
[1:00:30] friday_exe: its scummy
[1:00:31] OG_Kawngi: FOMO is OP
[1:00:38] mycho_: If it helps server stability im for it
[1:00:39] SBG0AT: pay more to find the first wave of bugs before the blue collar gamers log in
[1:00:39] 心さとみ: its good for independent studios who dont rely on publishign
[1:00:55] Camelbak21: Can't wait for the secret lvling tech
[1:00:56] Spartany25: full capatalist move, nothing to do with gaming
[1:01:01] nadtank: I love that beta acsess comes with it.
[1:01:12] antipheonixna: its toxic and not valuable product, but ppl neeeeeed it so credit card yoink
[1:01:13] Beebooga: it might help with bottnecking starting zone
[1:01:17] Warzam: @maximum can’t it also be a way to unload servers for the actual launch?
[1:01:23] Dorittolol: if your dad was steam and watched your youtube video, what would christmas give him?
[1:01:23] StanRaenslen: they did increase what you get for the lesser tiers
[1:01:26] sorliee: I love modern day capitalism 😍
[1:01:33] OG_Kawngi: there's no sign ups for beta atm like before, are they going to make it exclusive to giga edition
[1:01:42] Xyphin: F&F Alpha
[1:01:43] Higgoms: didn't they let you kinda buy in to mop beta with a 6 month sub back in the day too
[1:01:43] Camelbak21: ANNUAL SUB got you beta and D4 back in the day Pogger
[1:01:54] Camelbak21: I mean D3
[1:01:55] Jjmn12: shocked you can't buy beta access on the trading post am i right
[1:02:01] SBG0AT: the only real advantage you get is leveling up professions and farming mats right? the early access gamers get a head start on auction house capitalism
[1:02:01] xxoutkastedxx: it also means more poeple will use the beta for its purpose instead of seeing it early
[1:02:03] thomas_rl2: max you should play type racer
[1:02:06] sorliee: Aware
[1:02:08] sorliee: Aware 󠀀

[1:02:19] Dorittolol: it was annual sub
[1:02:19] Camelbak21: Annual pass
[1:02:20] OG_Kawngi: it was the annual pass
[1:02:26] Spartany25: 12 years already? holy

[1:05:20] misfitstv1: what are you’re current macros?
[1:05:27] fujihd: Have you seen that guy who eats it every day... hes on like day 800 @Maximum
[1:05:39] iccyc0ld: People calling out an hour before their shift start Sadge

[1:05:47] fujihd: Lmao yeah he eats it every day
[1:05:49] sorliee: thats not good for you
[1:05:50] Spartanate: How are the McDonalds franchises that Liquid gave you guys doing
[1:05:53] iccyc0ld: AINTNOWAY
[1:05:56] Jarlan23: i wonder what ur gut flora is like eating that shit every day
[1:05:57] Punk611: Yo they added Diable 1 and Warcraft 1/2 to bnet.
[1:05:59] zannuss: I eat it like once or twice a year
[1:06:00] SBG0AT: I have a coworker that eats chipotle twice a day every single day
[1:06:12] LemmingsOCE: Hey Max, i have a structured settlement and i need cash now. Any advice?
[1:06:12] Ganryu22: @iccyc0ld it wa fake, we all know it was panda express ones
[1:06:13] Mecabeast: chipotle has really good macros
[1:06:15] Xyphin: Chi-potel
[1:06:19] destrominater: Ya, chipotle is good. But how often do you need to buy new underwear after getting bloody poops?
[1:06:24] sixRlNGS_: I’d shit my pants if I ate chipotle before the gym
[1:06:25] Jnxz: it's all processed food - blah
[1:06:29] edoryus: chipotle gets me bricked up
[1:06:40] splashz0r: going to workout on an empty stomach with 2 scoops of preworkout GIGACHAD
[1:06:43] Airies11: maximumW
[1:06:50] zannuss: Never been a big fan of chipotle
[1:06:54] sixRlNGS_: they tell you it’s not processed but cmon lol
[1:06:54] iccyc0ld: They cook the food on a grill. I guess that's processed KEKW
[1:06:57] zannuss: was more of a moes guy
[1:06:58] bglpuppy2: Moe >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> chipotle
[1:06:59] Beebooga: you can smell the fake on qdoba
[1:07:01] shubh432: for food safety everything is proccesed
[1:07:08] SBG0AT: chipotle is pretty natty their tortillas have a ton of fat in them but thats 90% of tortillas
[1:07:11] Jarlan23: i heard their steak isnt from happy cows
[1:07:11] fujihd: nah they grill and make all their shit
[1:07:12] WiseOldMandu: Literally any food that plays to your macros is good food. Processed or not.
[1:07:15] iccyc0ld: They make the pico de gallo fresh
[1:07:15] OG_Kawngi: chat owned
[1:07:20] Basic_3: Do people have a thing in mind when they say "processed" ?
[1:07:27] iccyc0ld: Its all the salt
[1:07:35] eddym310: article sponsored by chipotle™
[1:07:40] greenmachine11235: The unprocessed is the reason why chipotle has had multiple issues with samonilla
[1:07:42] fujihd: LMAO
[1:07:56] iccyc0ld: People drinking protein shakes complaining about processed food KEKW
[1:08:00] oneifbyland: you cannot do that. the FDA will come for your ass
[1:08:01] Beebooga: its not a lie if you just use fancy words
[1:08:01] bglpuppy2: my local chipotle sucks ass, also they definitely are much less locally sourced than they used to be
[1:08:01] Ganryu22: Not processed it is still semi-industrial, too much fat and salt
[1:08:07] FortitudoMultis: "Processed" is also kind of a buzzword tho
[1:08:08] Demonxly: he said sue in amercia
[1:08:10] nemziac: cigs, oil companies
[1:08:17] shubh432: theya re not saying there  ffood is not prccsesed

[1:08:20] bglpuppy2: also "locally sourced" is open to interpretation
[1:08:25] shubh432: they are saying less
[1:08:27] Stooks_: but what if everyone else is making that assumption
[1:08:27] rypien: Subway was caught doing it with chicken. More soy than chicken in their grilled chicken.
[1:08:38] BigTrout3: washing vegetables is a form processing. therefore, washed vegetables are bad for you
[1:08:38] misfitstv1: best way to judge if things are processed is by the amount of single ingredient items on a menu. so they will be one of the best by far
[1:08:45] turnsta: scratchy t hroat
[1:08:45] letrickyxd: Scratchy
[1:08:49] edoryus: the slight itch

[1:09:04] zannuss: It's like a little tingle and light dryness right
[1:09:05] edoryus: i know what you mean
[1:09:08] Ganryu22: Sodium is likely the biggest threat to healthy eating at Chipotle. A flour tortilla itself has about 600 milligrams of sodium
[1:09:09] UjioSanada: !drops
[1:09:19] oneifbyland: gargle some honey YEP

[1:12:24] Demonxly: actor in what
[1:12:27] highcard2: i feel like max is very anti-bragging, i cant imagine him ever boasting about something like that
[1:12:50] Spartanate: Was that the one where you ate batteries?
[1:12:55] Demosyn: @Maximum All the Asian food places near me are wearing masks again suddenly. So I assume some type of flu or cold is going around atm. They always seem ahead of things in my area.
[1:13:08] demepunkk: how perfect can a bag drop be LUL
[1:13:09] Wincrediboy: max I just watched your video from today and watching you fly around for 20min with a big DURABILITY LOW in the middle of the screen is so tilting

[1:13:29] Penicillin17: did they make you drop the bag?
[1:13:40] Beebooga: drop the bag to get the bag

[1:15:24] Alarius_: go outside? yikes
[1:15:27] zannuss: wtf is ralphs
[1:15:30] deepcalm: chatter doesn't know what "processed" food means. usually, as long as you can look at food and identify where it came from (ie, the meat in this burrito is from a chicken) then food is literally just macro and micro nutrients. a twinkie is processed food. a bunch of chicken, rice, beans mixed together, isn't.

[1:17:04] Squats3: last time we got a new bliz exec max was cool with.. this time he just shits on her product at first glance
[1:17:15] Chappypappy1: Imma say it - if u get promoted to president as blizz ur probs just as demonic as all the others
[1:17:19] Storrs_: she was the John Height of COD if that is any indication of her role in the development of the game
[1:17:33] Squats3: I have a very very very hard time thinking this person cares about games at all
[1:17:36] FortitudoMultis: Oof

[1:33:57] deepcalm: COD is the most "normie" game on earth besides like Madden or FIFA... WoW is a niche game. and they're both run by the same company. wowhead commenters are of course going to be malding in the comments
[1:34:01] Camelbak21: They have to carry Blizzcon, no?
[1:34:05] fronkacean: heard she just forced a moonkin buff through???

[1:35:37] Metaphix: refreshes every month, earn points, unlock rewards as you continue to play. Seems similar
[1:35:44] Aidan_CG: people are just combining random words together and hitting post, hoping they made a sick argument
[1:35:48] malnourish_: I wouldn’t say they don’t have anything in common….

[1:36:16] zarlunce: That works when the game is atleast decent, i quit 2nd day of this patch. As a warrior main i just couldnt take the pain anymore

[1:36:38] Dash_O_Pepper: #ad
[1:36:54] malnourish_: it’s just battlepass lite
[1:36:59] OG_Kawngi: it's basically a free tier battle pass
[1:37:07] Dash_O_Pepper: FOMO, that's what battle pass is
[1:37:12] Jazzarus_: This is my favorite season since I started playing WoW, granted, I started at 9.2 LUL
[1:37:13] edoryus: progress bar like a battle pass
[1:37:15] surpriseparty20: People consider it a start for more scummy monetisation that's why theu don't like it . Or atleast that's what I got from reading comments

[1:37:39] Grissu_: I just wish prices would be better adjusted. Not 2 mounts for 800 tenders....
[1:37:39] Squats3: free tier battle pass is what it is. and its good. they decided to not sell tindies for money which was the best choice they couldve made
[1:37:42] heisunknown: I think people expect it as a soft launch into a battlepass
[1:37:48] Phatori: i Hope battle passes come with CE Title and your pick at a free Glad mount @Maximum
[1:37:57] Dash_O_Pepper: it's the beta for their battle pass
[1:38:01] DAISHI__: it's just some side challenges and you get rewards from it. play the game = get stuff. totally different from a battlepass imo
[1:38:14] kibler83: no one is complaining about what u just mentioned max
[1:38:16] edoryus: @Phatori lol nice
[1:38:27] Jazzarus_: those are exactly the comments I want to read from them, they don't dissapoint
[1:38:27] antipheonixna: were old daily quests battle passes :P

[1:38:39] 310toyuumi: Reading these sets me off. what does TOMRUS have to say?
[1:38:45] selliondk: to the ppl above^ you'd have the sub anyways, a real battle pass u wouldn't have and it'd be extra. it's just an extra incentive to keep u as a customer and also profitable, like a 2 for 1 sale on a monthly basis for random sht
[1:38:59] OG_Kawngi: oh no, bobby defenders are here

[1:39:14] danksly: yer
[1:39:15] fujihd: 1000000000000000%
[1:39:15] Dash_O_Pepper: does it impact another 800 employees for 0.5% profit?
[1:39:23] pvalue01: it really depends on her management strategy, which we dont really know
[1:39:35] SLS_Beegor: monkaW
[1:39:35] FortitudoMultis: PauseChamp

[2:03:18] adapt_123: i hate how hearsthone makes me play a card game .... so sad... really
[2:03:26] juuno106: make the mobs more of a throughput check and let the affixes add scaling complexity imo
[2:03:31] wiffysniff: the dratty goated GIGACHAD
[2:03:37] theDirtyon3: he has great listening cues
[2:03:41] DankWizard420: @adapt_123 woah there dont say that, you dont even need to play anymore
[2:03:44] ritosneaker: it's obvious when you disagree because you're doing the math trying to figure out how stupid someone is. @Maximum
[2:03:44] Veszyx_: @Maximum It's called active listening.
[2:03:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: being a good listener is such a hard skill
[2:03:53] Madidius: The example they were trying to make with that is wanting you to only pull 5 takes away the group being able to scale the difficulty themselves by pulling more non-threatening mobs
[2:03:53] Joneim: DRATTY
[2:03:55] Onyo1337: who isnt ?
[2:03:56] sheckles: DRATTY
[2:04:05] AoPsyke: GIGACHAD Dratnos Enjoyers
[2:04:06] Blightrose: he doesnt stream enough
[2:04:08] fronkacean: cuz he is incredibly niche
[2:04:08] JustJoshin____: big tru
[2:04:08] nightst314: he isn't going for doomer clicks
[2:04:11] ahri_feet_connoisseur: not bald enough
[2:04:15] Caseman984: Dratty D on the Poddy C
[2:04:18] bigmeanbeefy: I think that might be because his content is for a small % of the playerbase
[2:04:19] 03Turbo03: Then why don't you sign him to commentate on Race to world First
[2:04:26] aurochz: ellesmere's drip baseg
[2:04:27] dango0n: dratnos x Liquid soon?
[2:04:31] peepofeelings: i live for dratnos vault videos
[2:04:43] DanteDemonZ: I love Dratnos but I tried to watch his Stream and his UI gave me an aneurysm
[2:04:45] Camelbak21: Maybe he blows up with this alpha
[2:04:47] Squats3: agreed
[2:04:47] Madgeneto: @03Turbo03 cause echo gets him first xdd
[2:04:48] Onyo1337: his weekly vault videos go hard
[2:04:49] Jazzarus_: but you say "Turbo" and "Natty"
[2:04:52] Caseman984: I think you and dratnos is the best, also a cat
[2:04:54] luxumbra69: datnos YT is good, dratnos twitch is garbo
[2:05:11] 03Turbo03: @Madgeneto Pay him more
[2:05:13] Xann_: @bigmeanbeefy @bigmeanbeefy Dratnos did entire hour long Tank guides on every single tank class specifically aimed at new tank players.
[2:05:20] vomit_cat: Just get better 4Head old man is mad he can't keep up
[2:05:21] oneifbyland: Dratnos is extremely intelligent and that intimidates people. I've seen a LOT of commetns talking about people being "annoyed by his voice" or other silly things and you know it's just cuz they're mad about being dumb
[2:05:21] ritosneaker: the need for weakauras
[2:05:28] ritosneaker: and the mental capacity requirement
[2:05:29] Madgeneto: @Madgeneto ok
[2:05:29] fronkacean: @03Turbo03 i dont think max is the one hiring casters
[2:05:36] DanteDemonZ: @luxumbra69 I love his YT, and I have watched him stream M+ but it is the big issue WoW has in general in which every streamer has completely different UI and is overwhelming for new viewers
[2:05:36] Joneim: I dont see the raid thing
[2:05:40] Frozenbozo: you have the massive abillity of not being able to shup up which is big for streaming
[2:05:40] 1vladijmir: Father Ellesmere PREACHING Okayge
[2:05:56] ahri_feet_connoisseur: weakauras bloat?
[2:05:59] sosadparadise: nerf gets mad he overlaps leg sweep and now he wants less complexity? (im trolling btw)
[2:06:01] easyafff: ellsmere tears
[2:06:13] Xann_: @bigmeanbeefy tell me you don't watch his videos without telling me you don't watch his videos.  Don't say things just to say things.
[2:06:19] Ok_Kingston: this raid is stupid hard still even post nerfs
[2:06:21] 03Turbo03: @fronkacean I think bases on his casters he has he has a influence on how cast for RTWF
[2:06:23] clickermekk: I've become a better player but the game has noticeably gotten a smidge more difficult for sure
[2:06:25] Mageulook_69: as a 37 year old big dick gamer this is why i no longer play retail wow, but still enjoy watching it
[2:06:33] DankWizard420: the more m+ ramps in mechanics the less fun it becomes YEP
[2:06:37] KaisenSiru: Good
[2:06:38] Madgeneto: @rennjulive i mean that's the same thing
[2:06:40] tobbs94: hardest end game trio
[2:06:44] fronkacean: @03Turbo03 i think u arent very aware but i respect it
[2:06:45] gotsh0cks: Blackhand is still up there
[2:06:49] ubba90: hardest raid of the xpac maybe
[2:06:53] sosadparadise: @rennjulive i'm saying the timing is funny
[2:07:00] cornygerman: ye were on fyrakk mythic now, but actually our raid loves it both of them are super fun
[2:07:01] Eradiox: this raid is ez as hell.... only last 2 bosses are hard as fuck
[2:07:04] DanteDemonZ: Fryakk harder than KJ?
[2:07:29] Xann_: All of modern WoW is harder than KJ
[2:07:31] DanteDemonZ: @Eradiox Smolderon ain't ez
[2:07:37] Eradiox: sure :D
[2:07:37] ligament_champion: firstGarf
[2:07:56] ahri_feet_connoisseur: firstGarf
[2:07:56] gotsh0cks: Smolderon is perfect
[2:08:13] cosmocramer: Love smoldy boy
[2:08:14] Nyurro: smolderon is the best boss in the raid tbh
[2:08:15] gotsh0cks: Tindral still more fun than SLG
[2:08:15] clickermekk: agree with ur smoldie take somewhat. those orb macros bring it down for me
[2:08:21] Ok_Kingston: im so sick of blizzx making raids for RWF and then leaving it
[2:08:26] ridder30: smoldy claps cheeks
[2:08:31] TehWongWay: the only cringe thing for smolderon is the private aura
[2:08:36] DanteDemonZ: I think the main issue casuals have with Smolderon is feeling a need to use weakauras for Seeking Inferno
[2:08:46] Madgeneto: why rashok better?
[2:08:51] asd123qwerty1: Smolderon is infinetly harder than rashok was
[2:08:58] cornygerman: I think the bosses being hard is fine if they are as fun to do as Tindral and Fyrakk
[2:09:09] TattersAU: Smold was ok for private aura, just 4 was too much
[2:09:26] lambowarlock: @Maximum  MYTHIC ARCHIMONDE hardest of all time!
[2:09:27] TehWongWay: private auras just feels so anti-player, any significant private aura they make will always be out macro'd
[2:09:37] jimmistreet007: jimmistreet007 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:09:38] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Stupid question but can't FF14 raiders also use "macros"?
[2:09:43] ahri_feet_connoisseur: since that game has no addons
[2:09:44] DanteDemonZ: @TehWongWay hard agree
[2:10:00] DanteDemonZ: ffxiv does have addons
[2:10:01] TattersAU: private aura the volcoross mythic soak would be a good example
[2:10:13] ahri_feet_connoisseur: like communication via button presses I guess
[2:10:17] texas_grizzly: Macros in FFXIV are dogwater
[2:10:26] DanteDemonZ: the ffxiv modding scene is crazy
[2:10:27] snowfloofy: UAV zoom hacks Binoculars
[2:10:28] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I dont necessarily play ff14
[2:10:29] Scolpi: ellsmere
[2:10:35] ripsaltytv: ripsaltytv subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:10:37] gotsh0cks: You can one button add on your rotation in ff14
[2:10:45] ahri_feet_connoisseur: i see
[2:10:54] DankWizard420: @gotsh0cks my rotato is 1 button at almost 50 Susge
[2:10:56] JakeParkbench: @gotsh0cks yeah but it will clip and be shit
[2:11:22] Madgeneto: @DankWizard420 you broke my brain
[2:11:32] DanteDemonZ: @gotsh0cks true, besides certain specs like Black Mage (for my WoW gamers that is their hard spec equivalent of Arcane Mage)
[2:11:34] DankWizard420: I wish we went back to the triple chest m+ Sadge
[2:12:01] malnourish_: his point is they don’t want them to coincide
[2:12:06] Nyurro: whats the jb idea?
[2:12:15] DanteDemonZ: whats ur thoughts on letting Mythic+ players target Myth track items like trinkets and not have to pray for vault rng every week?
[2:12:19] Palimanj: everyone should just play maplestory
[2:12:33] cliffster: cliffster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:12:37] ritoky: difficulty caps at 20 and timer reduces beyond 20 i think was jbs basic idea
[2:12:43] DankWizard420: @Palimanj thanks for reminding me I'm forever stuck on 1 map YEP
[2:12:43] karkarnarnar: I think the point was that the difficulty could just be the timer. If you scale enemy HP only, eventually you're just DPS racing the clock.
[2:12:51] midiansgod: Get rid of all the bullshit affixes and just make them overall harder damage and healing required and then you would have top tier at like +11's lol
[2:13:03] Nyurro: Yo thats a sick idea
[2:13:04] Palimanj: @DankWizard420 what lv ru
[2:13:04] OG_Kawngi: Blizz no longer allowing GDKP in SoD LUL
[2:13:05] tumb_tack: Does it matter for the rest of the player base? though? Let the casuals rule for a season!
[2:13:07] Slapsstick: scale health instead of damage after a certain level is a good one imo
[2:13:09] batu_x96: way better
[2:13:10] Metaphix: interesting
[2:13:11] ahri_feet_connoisseur: i like the idea of a time trial
[2:13:14] batu_x96: u need to do more dps then
[2:13:14] szakal_TV: quick reminder flowers in everbloom still bolster
[2:13:16] batu_x96: aswell
[2:13:16] KUDVIN_DI: thats good idea
[2:13:17] Flippyyz: mob dmg stops at 25 or so and but the hp keeps going
[2:13:22] texas_grizzly: Would the gear still scale after 25 tho?
[2:13:22] DankWizard420: @Palimanj 210? idk not played in a while, on chocho island or something need to do dailies KEKW
[2:13:27] Flippyyz: so you time by dmg and not dying
[2:13:30] DanteDemonZ: @Slapsstick yeah the damage scaling gets too insane
[2:13:30] MicHawkh: way better  PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:13:38] Madgeneto: @midiansgod BASED
[2:13:38] bigmeanbeefy: @szakal_TV On death affixes in general aye, its really anoying
[2:13:39] Metaphix: pull half the dung at a time LUL
[2:13:40] Palimanj: @DankWizard420 KEKW chu chu island im level 271 training is easier now
[2:13:43] Repsie: tiger paw overlap Aware
[2:13:43] Lilurrn: That would make more classes meta
[2:13:54] Slapsstick: @Slapsstick itd have the same effect as scaling down time so oh whale
[2:14:01] friendshrimp: dungeon pool last season suuuucked
[2:14:06] DankWizard420: @Palimanj started making alts for legion but thought to myself..I just did this Pepega
[2:14:12] wiffysniff: aug or nothing wasn't fun last season either
[2:14:17] ciraxa: YEP i miss UR tho
[2:14:22] batu_x96: i think this season is boring
[2:14:31] lion8991719: @Palimanj @DankWizard420 maplestory omegalul
[2:14:32] Artheeri: no seasonals and so many old dungeons ain't that good in my opinion, should be 6 current and 2 old ones
[2:14:33] Madgeneto: everybody agrees, but everyone disagrees on which are the bad ones xdd
[2:14:35] Phatori: nah apparently according to twitter its cause of the mount and the prestige of getting KSM. This mount was cooler so more ppl played.
[2:14:40] Saiyoran: throne is awful, people weren't wrong
[2:14:44] d0mezg4mer: wow players cannot identify what they like before it's out
[2:14:47] swisher_szn: i just wanna play algethar academy man
[2:14:55] fdb33: ToTT is so rough in pugs and yet still fun
[2:15:04] fdb33: idk how they did it but they def did
[2:15:07] DrQuackzalver: keys are easier this season, that's the whole reason
[2:15:14] batu_x96: i wanna play junkyard all day with all 3 bots
[2:15:27] batu_x96: and max bfa corruption
[2:15:27] tumb_tack: As a casual yes
[2:15:27] AgrM_Gengar: its definitely that
[2:15:33] tumb_tack: I can time 20s
[2:15:34] ahri_feet_connoisseur: easier = way less stress
[2:15:35] Cole_Trane: that's a massive reason
[2:15:38] bramilol: easier gear i think thats more important than a route or good dungeons
[2:15:41] Cole_Trane: people have fun when they win
[2:15:41] notSobar: loved prideful
[2:15:45] kaleswow: achievements = fun
[2:15:49] Clarius: as someone who only do keys for vault and gear, absolutely YEP
[2:15:49] fallen_jdb: Yeah people getting KSM are feeling good this season right?
[2:15:55] WarNoPants: why does Ellsmere look like he's hosting SNL
[2:16:04] notSobar: It felt so good as holy priest
[2:16:18] Felryn: i did at most 20s at fuck prideful
[2:16:19] ubba90: i did 24 and under and prideful was still dog shit
[2:16:21] Punk611: hated prideful as someone who did sub 20s.
[2:16:21] just_one_sock: Keys being generally easier to get KSM / KSH is overall a good thing for the population and continued engagement. It just is.
[2:16:22] Harry_barry_larry: @WarNoPants holy shit he does loook like hes straight outta the snl intro
[2:16:28] Madgeneto: i only did 20s and i hated it, i must be a god gamer Kappa
[2:16:29] Jazzarus_: Getting 2.5k for the transmog effect feels good
[2:16:31] Felryn: no shot people liked prideful you're trolling
[2:16:33] thenateo2: season 2 affixes were way harder than prideful in shadowlands tho @Maximum
[2:16:36] piratepolo15: piratepolo15 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:16:38] saynotofannypacks: prideful was as because if u wiped on boss, you couldnt do it with out the prideful
[2:16:43] Felryn: D:
[2:16:46] d0mezg4mer: its a good reminder that the content creator opinion does not represent the community as a whole
[2:16:47] clickermekk: prideful was OK but didnt like it was set at 20%
[2:16:48] wiffysniff: hated prideful xddShrug
[2:16:51] AgrM_Gengar: prideful felt way too punishing, like missing a hero
[2:16:52] zeitgeiz: I hated at all levels
[2:16:52] just_one_sock: @felryn I loved it, but I stayed at 15s
[2:17:02] silmarilen: prideful was fun if you could kill them without cooldowns
[2:17:03] Punk611: the fact it made you pay attention to count so much was just bad. even at sub 20s.
[2:17:03] bigmeanbeefy: cuse all of them are dps players, kek
[2:17:04] Felryn: @just_one_sock, hm fascinating
[2:17:05] Slapsstick: prideful was cool because i never had to skip it
[2:17:06] notSobar: unlimited mana, I'm in
[2:17:12] Ok_Kingston: prideful sucked as a tank it required exact pulls with 20% intervals
[2:17:13] fruitcake893: prideful was dogshit in low pugs because people would just leave if one got messed up
[2:17:16] karkarnarnar: prideful was bad for the 10-15 range because it was tied to count. So one bodypull or bad route could ruin the run.
[2:17:17] Madgeneto: better than the average seasonal, but still hated it
[2:17:19] gotsh0cks: @bigmeanbeefy famed DPS player ellesmere
[2:17:21] Poxx26: dude dratanos' beard, what a cute chad
[2:17:32] bigmeanbeefy: @gotsh0cks i said his chat btw
[2:17:40] Sleicreider: Pride full caused +15  ppl to plan and understand routs, nowadays nobody has a plan
[2:18:06] DankWizard420: prideful was great, idk if it was actually good or if it was firstpatch syndrome YEP
[2:18:11] notSobar: I liked the fact that prideful encouraged planning and using something like mythic dungeon tool maps to plan the pulls
[2:18:28] clickermekk: Chat anyone able to read through Max's reflection of his glasses?
[2:18:34] Rugburn__: sponges are not fun
[2:18:35] itsCelivan: I wasn't sure if tettles was just really still or if that was a static pic
[2:18:40] Madgeneto: @clickermekk ENHANCE
[2:18:58] MrDrexand: just another way to make it against the timer rather than just survive
[2:19:11] notSobar: always looking for the meta
[2:19:13] clickermekk: @Madgeneto ill log on sham thanks
[2:19:15] Dritlukt: s2 in a nutshell
[2:19:22] heisunknown: aka, don't take a shaman at some point
[2:19:26] Madgeneto: @Madgeneto ok
[2:19:37] drazzil7: I think thats why people enjoy this season 15-22s. Because you wont die if you miss an interupt or stop. As long as you stop the next one its salvagable and wont ruin the pull.
[2:19:58] Veszyx_: All my homies hate Tyrannical.
[2:20:04] Spartany25: Then slow rampers like boomy and fire mage loose a ton of value. They do so much more dam in 30s
[2:20:10] Mattyuh: @drazzil7 you just make the healer hate life when a kick is missed
[2:20:11] DrQuackzalver: they should up the base level health too a bit, so more classes can ramp and it's not just DH and fury deleting packs in 5s
[2:20:11] friendshrimp: most fun affix was encrypted hope we get it someday again
[2:20:40] Clarius: thats how Igira feels in the raid
[2:20:50] DankWizard420: tyrannical as an affix isnt good KEKW
[2:20:55] Faraday5001: oh pog they just banned gdkp in classic... gonna be some banger wowhead comments to react to soon
[2:20:55] Veszyx_: And then the blow to morale when you wipe and have to start over, especially if you used lust.
[2:21:02] luxumbra69: bdgg
[2:21:03] MrDrexand: bdgg?
[2:21:04] gotsh0cks: BDGG
[2:21:04] daggerd314: bdg I thought

[2:21:42] Spartany25: Remember they had to Quit the race early cuz people had to go back to work
[2:21:50] forphium: why not make tyrann just extra mechanics on bosses
[2:21:52] Spartany25: sfo was redonculas

[2:22:15] Ketchumer: Ketchumer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[2:22:15] cannibalcanyon: PREACH
[2:22:19] Veszyx_: On that note, the Igira fight puts me the fuck to sleep.
[2:22:27] MajorBenny: yo iridikron is nice even on long bosses
[2:22:46] notSobar: Seems like the swap though caters to both sides
[2:23:00] fdb33: fortified could also be like more mob health only nd tyrranicalmore boss dmg, so take out half of the affix
[2:23:04] just_one_sock: I hate tyrannical so much
[2:23:04] FlutterBaby: @MajorBenny you must not be a healer lol
[2:23:11] cannibalcanyon: big numbers plz
[2:23:11] jonpelf: just ramp dam on bosses and not health-- and adjust key timer ro compensate
[2:23:31] lathander557: Tyrannical feels so bad because the bosses take forever PLUS at a certain point all their shit one shots you, same argument as before
[2:23:32] Durenas: yeah i feel any activity has a lifespan
[2:23:37] jonpelf: for tyrannical
[2:23:37] kniftty: What do you think the sweet spot is for a total dungeon timer? Or a time range
[2:23:40] Ok_Kingston: ELLSMERE
[2:23:46] notSobar: @FlutterBaby MaxLOL
[2:23:47] DankWizard420: @Veszyx_ even as a pleb only on heroic, igira even feels wrong compared to every other boss KEKW
[2:23:48] DrQuackzalver: Tyrannical adds another phase to all bosses
[2:23:48] sw0ngs: nah if they get rid of tyran and fort, then it'll forever be one spec and talent trees will be really boring and it'll be a new problem
[2:24:04] luxumbra69: elle looks like such a baws in that pic
[2:24:10] Aemon__: 85%
[2:24:11] lathander557: ...80%?

[2:24:26] Spartany25: 99.99
[2:24:26] cannibalcanyon: checks out
[2:24:26] JustJoshin____: oh 99%
[2:24:27] itsCelivan: prolly like 15 people
[2:24:30] splashz0r: it's like 98% of players who stepped foot in a m+
[2:24:32] ridder30: 99
[2:24:37] Azkrust: 69%
[2:24:37] Mageulook_69: 3650
[2:24:38] Denz_9: 3500 in na
[2:24:39] Nyurro: like 1550
[2:24:40] silmarilen: 3.6kish
[2:24:42] Nyurro: 3550
[2:24:43] fdb33: its .1% ya
[2:24:47] jonpelf: just change tyrannical to not change boss health BUT reduce the timer or something else to compensate
[2:24:50] MrDrexand: all 27s-ish probably
[2:24:52] notSobar: Yeah 22 feels bad, don't enjoy it.
[2:25:02] highcard2: 98 or 99
[2:25:05] forphium: top 10% is basically all 20s according to raiderio
[2:25:09] Palimanj: I did a 23 once
[2:25:11] honeyyyyyy: thats .01%
[2:25:15] Durenas: i do 18-20 entirely for the loot. not because i enjoy it
[2:25:18] derpunch: never do more than 21s
[2:25:18] Purdhammer: i leave at 2500 io
[2:25:20] DankWizard420: still no reason to do anything above a 20 KEKW
[2:25:34] Maximum: @Palimanj thats hype
[2:25:40] lathander557: If you're pushing 30's the mode just isn't made for you, 2bad kek
[2:25:42] ridder30: its unpopular because they cant do it
[2:25:51] juuno106: im trash at the game but i just have fun in 20-22s
[2:25:55] Spartany25: What if they made title .25 to line it up with the number of CE players?
[2:26:03] Arc365: think itd be better if they just capped it out at like whatever level and tuned it properly then just rank based on speed
[2:26:06] swisher_szn: crazy how theres a mount reward at 2k and nothing for 3k
[2:26:06] derpunch: its unpopular cause everyone leaves the key after 1 mistake
[2:26:13] give_me_a_1_in_chat: its unpopular because there is no reason to do it
[2:26:17] DankWizard420: 20+ has rio that is it
[2:26:17] Palimanj: I push the first 2 3 weeks so I can do boosts for the rest of the season
[2:26:17] squimper: j
[2:26:19] Thasin22: There is no reward
[2:26:23] sw0ngs: you know what this is all about, streamers who's primary job is doing keys are just complaining their job is too hard lol
[2:26:24] Durenas: there are very few bosses in mythic+ that 30% more health matters. there are a few, but most, no.
[2:26:26] blit_dn: the title
[2:26:28] Nyurro: title is the only reward left
[2:26:29] nemziac: que times are just too long over 20
[2:26:31] 03Turbo03: Bragging rights in guild
[2:26:33] Hamsterjan: Bragging rights LUL
[2:26:35] mab_music_ttrpg: and the title is pretty much out of range if you pug.
[2:26:36] JustJoshin____: its a huge time sink too. one fuck up and the last 30 minutes is gone
[2:26:37] heisunknown: 18 gets you good enough vault, etc
[2:26:40] just_one_sock: I tend to agree with just about everything Ellesmere says. Same wavelength and I think he's got good views.
[2:26:48] Crazyhealer1: to brag that you're better than everyone else? idk lol
[2:26:48] swisher_szn: add a weapon illusion for 3k plz
[2:26:48] greenmachine11235: there should NOT be a reward for content that 0.1% can do
[2:26:50] Byggareebob: Gdkps banned in classic holy shit people will be mad
[2:26:52] DankWizard420: a title you might not even get KEKW
[2:26:55] WingedChipmunk: the challenge is not worth the reward
[2:26:55] squimper: I stopped pushing when I got to 20/21. Why would I push higher?
[2:26:56] ripsaltytv: Issue being is that if blizzard puts in rewards for keys at that high of a level that more casual player base WILL complain
[2:26:58] surpriseparty20: Realistically who gives a fuck about a title
[2:26:58] Karkesis: I literally stop keys after +20 for exactly that reason, no reward = no point for me
[2:27:03] relicz: need some reward at 3k or 3.2k
[2:27:11] 03Turbo03: Bragging rights in guild and among like players
[2:27:18] TronkTV: tough pugging 24+ takes forever to find a group that'll take my warrior
[2:27:31] Durenas: i think there should be a key level cap outside of MDI or test realm
[2:27:37] Spartany25: 100% agree
[2:27:39] Byggareebob: People who get ego over io score are the worst man
[2:27:43] Punk611: "casuals" also don't want to scrap a key because it's scuffed. they'd rather complete it no matter what.
[2:27:45] notSobar: I kinda like the split because of the variety, and it keeps you chasing
[2:27:46] healapotamus: honestly after you do A 20 why really do anything other than 18’s- same loot just 1 upgrade below
[2:27:49] souledk: if they keep infinite scaling and make all these changes, they will be making a video next year that 35s are too difficult and long now
[2:28:19] Fleymour: Weapon illusion for 3k or something similar. Higher chance if avoidance on items..
[2:28:21] cannibalcanyon: fuck shields man
[2:28:47] ciraxa: @relicz they could even do 3k, 3.25k, 3.5k imo. from 3.2 to 0.1% is still a huuge gap
[2:28:49] cannibalcanyon: ONLY UP!?
[2:28:51] cannibalcanyon: lets fuckin go
[2:29:00] just_one_sock: @fleymour yes this, and only for the class you got to 3k to give incentive to play others.
[2:29:18] kneecapped: !links
[2:29:21] daggerd314: anyone know when next poddyC is?
[2:29:26] daggerd314: been like 2 weeks since last
[2:29:38] Nolbear1724: There is one out now lol
[2:29:46] lurthemir: One came out today
[2:29:47] daggerd314: hell yea
[2:30:06] Sinstacked: Fake PoddyC fans.
[2:30:08] fronkacean: that guys prolly on top of the world
[2:30:15] fronkacean: just wanted some content to figure out there was some ready for him
[2:30:18] daggerd314: I was workin' today sorry :'(
[2:30:20] LSDwight: I want some crazy M+ takes
[2:30:25] just_one_sock: "people who earn their clout are the worst, man"
[2:30:28] notSobar: I mean you earn it...but don't be shitastic on the plebians
[2:30:48] neinskn: thats why we earn it tho
[2:30:50] notSobar: I'm a plebian
[2:30:52] fronkacean: whatever that means
[2:30:56] Palimanj: 3.3k
[2:31:01] DrQuackzalver: 7
[2:31:01] Palimanj: im 2.9k so me
[2:31:02] caguirre18: 3400
[2:31:03] BabyDunn: 3k to me
[2:31:04] MrSuperFudge: Projection in its finest form
[2:31:05] texas_grizzly: 3k
[2:31:05] Jnxz: 4k io  :)
[2:31:06] Felryn: high io is my score, low is less than mine
[2:31:06] JustJoshin____: 1k
[2:31:08] Joneim: 1k is nuts
[2:31:09] notSobar: I got 2621, I don't grind m+ like crazy for increase
[2:31:10] Punk611: 3k
[2:31:11] ubba90: 3500 is high
[2:31:15] Jnxz: 5K io ?
[2:31:26] tumb_tack: 2500k rep
[2:31:27] burlin_: 400 io is pretty high
[2:31:31] DankWizard420: I saw a "high" rio to me like 3500 fuck up a basic mechanic and it was our fault PepeLaugh
[2:31:44] TBouse: and those people would be at the bottom end of the 3500 group lol
[2:31:53] Lothland: you who talks the most shit, the 2k ones who have a "main"
[2:31:53] notSobar: lol
[2:31:55] aurochz: @TBouse true
[2:31:57] Faraday5001: dont speak to me if youre not high io, at least 1500
[2:32:00] OG_Kawngi: they shove you in a locker too
[2:32:03] Tabun_Time: i think it is cuz the toxic ones talk more
[2:32:03] Mattyuh: its the 2900-3k IO guys that get the ego
[2:32:06] notSobar: I got told "YOU TROLLING" when I missed a mechanic
[2:32:07] Punk611: that happens in like 15-20s lol
[2:32:12] Troniin: i only pug and im in 27s and 28s right now, most people in these keys are pretty nice
[2:32:13] forphium: dunning kruger key effect
[2:32:14] notSobar: I honestly felt bad too though :P
[2:32:15] Lilurrn: I don't see higher end players shitting on lower players unless its like a 3k andy making fun of 2.5k players
[2:32:19] Ok_Kingston: I had 3.8k people join my key to brick it and make fun of me season 1
[2:32:33] notSobar: dude
[2:32:36] just_one_sock: I don't believe you
[2:32:39] Faraday5001: me
[2:32:42] just_one_sock: I genuinely don't believe that that happened.
[2:32:44] lathander557: 3.8k in season 1 like wasn't attainable
[2:32:45] DankWizard420: KEKW
[2:32:46] OG_Kawngi: that was me baseg
[2:32:46] JustJoshin____: dorki
[2:32:46] Ok_Kingston: they got banned lmao
[2:32:47] Palimanj: me
[2:32:48] notSobar: hahahaha
[2:32:50] Punk611: did people even get to 3.8k in season 1?
[2:32:51] caguirre18: me :)
[2:32:52] lurthemir: What if at +21 there was a 4th affix and you could choose to have 3 active for the key? It would allow for higher keys to drop Tyran/Fort for lower HP pools at the cost of greater mechanical complexity.
[2:32:57] just_one_sock: No, they didn't get banned, because it never happened.
[2:32:59] Ok_Kingston: its 100% happened
[2:33:08] alqallafi: Max blizzard ban GDKP on SOD need your take on that after this :D
[2:33:10] Pariahqt: one guyd
[2:33:10] Punk611: wasn't season 1 top like 3k 3.1k?
[2:33:28] DankWizard420: yalnu was a poorly designed fight when it weas released KEKWait
[2:33:29] mantooth11: 3K is like top 3% of M+ players, but everyone says it’s just decent.
[2:33:40] forphium: 3.6k was top s1  according to rio
[2:33:43] DanteDemonZ: @Ok_Kingston I had that happen, a 3.6K DH Tank joined Everbloom 25, he moved final boss frontal to wipe us all and then immediately left group BibleThump
[2:33:45] Mattyuh: highest IO s1 was just 3.6k
[2:33:50] kaleswow: season 1 top player was 3630
[2:33:52] Spartany25: the highest IO in season 1 was 3630
[2:33:54] Ok_Kingston: almosty all of my keys above a 24 are dope gamers
[2:33:54] luxumbra69: @mantooth11 top 3% of CHARACTERS, not players.
[2:34:04] DankWizard420: turn the knob PepeLaugh
[2:34:04] ciraxa: @mantooth11 im 3k and definitely just decent
[2:34:09] just_one_sock: I don't believe it happened.
[2:34:12] lathander557: CREDIBILITY DESTROYED
[2:34:24] Spartany25: ^
[2:34:35] cannibalcanyon: people acting like assholes in m+? never heard of it
[2:34:44] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[2:34:57] murazzond: im 2.7k and am noob :)
[2:34:58] luxumbra69: people always say top 0.1% of players. it isnt. its top 0.1% of characters. most of those people have multiple characters at the top 0.1% level.
[2:35:15] FlutterBaby: but were there 3.8k io scores in season 1 ???
[2:35:39] Eradiox: my guildmate is pushing 28 keys and i love watching the 20 min que times - 5 min key discussion and the best part is the group leaving after 2 min in key KEKW
[2:35:48] nightst314: have fun stressing out over speedruns
[2:35:57] highcard2: make it not go up infinitely
[2:36:02] VRVento: @Maximum it would be nice if once you did all 25's you got a new key that didnt deplete after one attempt
[2:36:02] Mattyuh: im a 3.4k healer and affixes make me hate keys
[2:36:03] im1nsidious: the doggos are just shlumped rn xD
[2:36:06] BabyDunn: capping key level i feel like disincentives wild and crazy new strats to shave time
[2:36:09] DankWizard420: m+ hasnt been properly cooked for 8years KEKBye
[2:36:11] zaqweezy: what is evergreen
[2:36:15] Ok_Kingston: most of my guild hates keys
[2:36:26] 1vladijmir: YEP 1 affix keys @Maximum
[2:36:32] arakardw: solo q system, penalty for leavers, only affixes that buff and here you go
[2:36:36] Ruinx81: What does stop scaling mean?
[2:36:38] Ok_Kingston: ONLY UP
[2:36:43] Madcatmk02: What if after a certain key levels the players also got scaling? to prevent things like only some classes being able to live
[2:36:46] Karkesis: I don't see how that really helps though cuz then like, if they stop scaling above 25 and only the timer changes, aren't the 25 and the 28 or whatever just exactly the same?  If you 3 chest the 25 you already know you can beat the 28, seems like it would be tedious
[2:36:48] kaleswow: @Ok_Kingston you're in the wrong guild my man
[2:36:52] DankWizard420: @Ok_Kingston wouldnt be surprised if part of that are the dungeons, especially the old dungeons chosen
[2:36:53] alqallafi: check last post on WOWHEAD , new drama coming :D
[2:36:56] duplexity_dave: @zaqweezy something that stays with the game (talent trees) and doesn't leave after an expac (legion artifacts)
[2:37:01] luxumbra69: @Ruinx81 dmg stops increasing with key level, HP only.
[2:37:11] Joneim: PepeLaugh
[2:37:12] Ok_Kingston: @kaleswow ITS MY GUILD LMAO
[2:37:17] Jarlan23: huge
[2:37:19] highcard2: how will that even work though?
[2:37:20] KaisenSiru: anniesPoint
[2:37:24] Mezzedii: GDKP blackmarket arises
[2:37:24] Madgeneto: HAH
[2:37:28] Mageulook_69: <3 great change
[2:37:29] Lothland: bots
[2:37:30] Tabun_Time: gold buyers
[2:37:33] SMORKw: because GDKP fucking sucks
[2:37:34] SMORKw: good fuck em
[2:37:35] DecayingPopcorn: no token in SOD
[2:37:43] SMORKw: its all RMT
[2:37:44] Mageulook_69: lol a lot = every player
[2:37:45] BigTrout3: they might say in the post
[2:37:47] ciraxa: surely no one will find a way to do it anyway Kappa
[2:37:49] nok_gg: People will still run gdkp it just won't get advertised and bids wont happen in game
[2:37:50] nightst314: RMT market probably makes more money than the sub
[2:37:50] Mezzedii: its all RMT no one is making legit thousands of gold per item
[2:37:58] Ashen_0: good, fuck rmt
[2:37:59] Madcatmk02: GDKP's ruin some of my enjoyment of classic for sure
[2:38:04] DankWizard420: good, fuck gdkps KEKW
[2:38:06] BabyDunn: W job blizzard
[2:38:14] give_me_a_1_in_chat: rip i liked it bc i didnt have to deal with guild politics. gg
[2:38:14] fdb33: theres a ton of RMT in classic. but get rid of GDKPs and the number of players gonna plummet
[2:38:16] szakal_TV: huge W
[2:38:17] Faraday5001: W

[2:38:20] SMORKw: FeelsStrongMan classic is back baby
[2:38:21] DankWizard420: lets be real, blizzard doesnt have the power to enforce this
[2:38:30] Mezzedii: everyone not RMTing
[2:38:31] Madcatmk02: The general community HATES GDKP
[2:38:31] highcard2: normal casual players
[2:38:32] BabyDunn: rich boys
[2:38:34] meatseekor: the casualls who dont even play the game

[2:38:39] nightst314: money making sheme
[2:38:39] Faraday5001: people HATE gdkps... they blame bots on them

[2:38:39] Punk611: GDKPs are bad
[2:38:40] Madgeneto: "looking for group looking for group looking for group"
[2:38:40] murazzond: what hdkp?
[2:38:42] Sch1ey: Yes
[2:38:43] thenateo2: There is absolutely no way they can stop people buying gear with gold
[2:38:45] murazzond: whats GDKP?
[2:38:46] ripsaltytv: RIP to most of Joker's streams, all love to him doe
[2:38:52] Alarius_: incoming SSF wow classic lol

[2:38:58] mycho_: Thats me
[2:39:02] fdb33: but people love to be ouitraged
[2:39:03] highcard2: least controversial blizz move
[2:39:09] kniftty: Wonder how people that stream classic wow feel
[2:39:10] Mezzedii: anyone with GDKP addon KEKW
[2:39:10] jesuslouise: i'll make it drama if i have to Madge
[2:39:11] Jibbles2020: how does one enforce something like this
[2:39:11] Sch1ey: @maximum me and my friend made 3 years of wrath tokens on p2
[2:39:11] DankWizard420: gdkps are an outlet for rmts and botting, they muddy the waters
[2:39:14] mousecarp: use discord
[2:39:20] thenateo2: its gonna be done in discord now
[2:39:22] Yuno951: @Maximum issue with GDKP just causes the market to skyrocket for everyday items
[2:39:24] DankWizard420: they 100% wont enforce this
[2:39:25] Sch1ey: P1
[2:39:25] HeffaBear: gdkp is the most common reason i hear why people wont play wotlk classic
[2:39:27] SMORKw: this makes GDKP really tedious so the majority of people wont do it
[2:39:28] Madgeneto: they'll use the NSA
[2:39:31] ripsaltytv: They just bid over discord, gg
[2:39:37] murazzond: @DankWizard420 oh those groups who organize these boosts etc
[2:39:38] SMORKw: it combats the majority
[2:39:40] jolehin: It doesnt matter if its not in game it will reduce it for sure
[2:39:43] x_Baggers: they have to try now
[2:39:45] SMORKw: there will be a minority ofc
[2:39:47] Mezzedii: its gonna stop the streamers for sure
[2:39:53] lurthemir: With what GMs? They just fired them now.
[2:39:54] give_me_a_1_in_chat: rip i liked it bc i didnt have to deal with guild politics anymore. gg oh well
[2:39:56] DankWizard420: @HeffaBear hit 80 (after classic) over christmas, trying to run icc once, just once before cata and it's impossible vs gdkps Sadge
[2:39:58] calvinandhobbes811: these changes and phase looks so good
[2:40:04] alqallafi: mostly streamers wont risk it , they effect the most
[2:40:06] jolehin: Not being public is good enough if u ask me
[2:40:08] zebracak35: They fired all their GMS, whos gonna ban people?
[2:40:08] Ruinx81: Inflation on SoD is nuts because of@gold buying, it’s 5g for basic greens
[2:40:10] Dnioyo: combats the advertisement of them more than the act itself I feel
[2:40:10] amandag94: amandag94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:40:13] Druntico: The issues of GDKP is that is being advertised globally and openly dragging in more players as it goes
[2:40:15] josh_is_chillin: how did they get so good at catching RMT? seems easy to do
[2:40:16] HeffaBear: @DankWizard420 exactly my mans
[2:40:19] Beantot127: did max suggest previously that capping m+ keys at a certain lvl is actually a good idea? or was i being trolled by a fried?
[2:40:22] breekicheeki9: yea that was the issue
[2:40:24] Ashen_0: just the fact that it is not allowed will make alot of people no want to participate
[2:40:30] calvinandhobbes811: @ruinx81 greens at max level lol
[2:40:34] calvinandhobbes811: not while leveling
