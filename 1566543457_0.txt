[1:14:37] Blightrose: 180 is very low
[1:14:38] Falkenberger: what is the difference between TGP and MDI?
[1:14:42] gurahkgurkan: @IAmMurloc_ bitrate
[1:14:47] trexter3000: im still trying to figure out how twitch is ok with them doing this on youtube as well
[1:14:49] Shapeshiftr28: looks more like 180p as you described. kekw
[1:14:54] zormaan: its probably pretty close to 180p
[1:14:54] AnesthesiaFC: bit rate is probably struggling
[1:14:59] Sephi1659: @Falkenberger same question here
[1:15:06] IAmMurloc_: @Blightrose hahaha 1080*
[1:15:09] Blightrose: @Falkenberger MDI is about speed, TGP is about how high you can push it
[1:15:09] ModeraYsera: @Falkenberger Mdi is fastest time, TGP is highest key
[1:15:12] Shankaze: WW singletarget KEKW

[1:16:53] D1Chile: @Warcraft  MAYBE THE MAGICAL DEBUFF FROM THE GUNNERS AT START OF DUNGEON

[1:17:34] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[1:17:34] Endolex: Interested to know who one of you casters is - I read "DOA" in the intro section but I can't seem to find them..?
[1:17:42] Agrellik: @trexter3000 it means you go +2 on the key. It used to give multiple chests when you did
[1:17:46] CritcobainTV: is it possible to see players gear / covenants?
[1:17:53] Syel_: @trexter3000 Back in Legion when you +1/+2/+3'd there was more chests of loot at the end, the chests went, the expression stayed
[1:17:55] thisyaboycam: he meant +2 key levels not multiple chest
[1:17:57] JanDeGrote1: @trexter3000 Term from back in the day if you did +2 your key it gave you 2 chests and +3 gave you 3 chests
[1:17:59] ShotgunWoW: @trexter3000 1 chest is +1 2 chest is +2 and 3 chest is +3
[1:17:59] Panflete: @trexter3000 they refer to how many levels the key increases
[1:18:09] Bearnoods: @trexter3000 You used to get chests depending how well you did, its basically you getting extra level ups on your key
[1:18:12] michaelbluth: @trexter3000 that's old terminology from legion where you used to get more chests based on how fast you complete the dungeon.  now a 2chest means the key will be upgrade 2levels instead of one
[1:18:12] moderatygos: we are working on getting the raider io page updated and it will show gear for completed dungeons
[1:18:16] BattlePandar: @trexter3000 back in legion you got 3 chests when you +3'd your key
[1:18:17] Garphus: cehat death probs
[1:18:19] wazon_7: echo not playing?
[1:18:20] exalted1715: @trexter3000 getting a "2 chest" means you completed the dungeon so quickly that the key levels up twice and you gain additional loot at the end.
[1:18:25] SwaggWaggon: @trexter3000 this is the real question honestly
[1:18:27] Xarisher: May we see Ambition POV?

[2:26:00] moderatygos: the gear extension isn't able to handle 6 teams simultaneously. its only set up for 2
[2:26:21] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: idea for great push side event, how high can teams go using the same comp of shadow priest, ret pally, affliction lock, brew master and disc
[2:26:32] ArnesMeyer: !!! PowerUpL AMBITION PowerUpR !!!
[2:26:46] NarrGhoul: You aren't able to see their actual gear directly but you can see what Trinkets (Icons only), whether they are using 4 Piece, their conduits, covenant and talent choices.  Along with their legendary choices (again as an icon only)
[2:26:50] Korono22: are dungs from workshop broken? It shows 31 timed arleady?
[2:26:56] Squirrely88: is there a way to check their gear chat?

[2:38:42] chody42069: bro they had to do a 27?????????
[2:38:55] NarrGhoul: @Rogastik Blood DK can do very well with NF provided they have a good group setup and synergy to make it work optimally.  On the other hand Kyrian is not as dependant on the synergy etc. but it benefits in that Shackle can be spread with HeartStrike or Marrowend
[2:39:11] enclavearmour: @deadphenome hidden for now, will be revealed tomorrow and the day after

[2:39:43] ModeraYsera: @Tachi_TV you may need to adjust your settings, it looks fine to me
[2:40:03] Audrix13: @Tachi_TV probably streaming from their channels or discord. so it could be double stream which would reduce it

[2:48:14] AkaPuppets: zmok D:
[2:48:19] NarrGhoul: @bouginio at higher key levels the Priest has better cooldowns as someone mentioned (PI and GS etc) but they also have a higher DPS throughput value at range where HPal and MMonks need to be in Melee which can make things much harder at higher keys
[2:48:20] chunkychug: @Beave_86 BDK + Gavel
