[1:42:57] OneTakeTony_: That's the next generation game controller
[1:43:12] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: There's already some reviews on on YouTube
[1:43:34] GoreScum: Doesnt look that revolutionary to me, VR kinda died back in 2018
[1:43:48] 11keithi: i get too sick :( :(
[1:43:56] OneTakeTony_: you control the ball with your brain no controls
[1:44:01] viirracocha: why u lost them as sponsors?

[1:44:36] Sdeleon159: The Bigscreen VR headset looks nice.
[1:44:42] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: But the thing is it's thinner and lighter and twice as powerful from what they're saying at least

[1:45:01] Pallyofhell: no
[1:45:01] Sqwabbles: nope

[1:45:54] LegendFromWoW: I cant do stuff with motion sickness, gaming isnt supposed to be uncomfortable.

[1:46:14] GoreScum: Failed
[1:46:32] HappyTuckerr: @LegendFromWoW It wont be eventually
[1:46:35] OneTakeTony_: Headbands that let you use controls with your brain waves is next generation peripheral for everything including VR
[1:46:47] viirracocha: spying on u
[1:46:51] LitheHS: thats cool
[1:46:53] LegendFromWoW: I wouldnt be surprised if Microsoft came out with a cheaper competitors to the Vision Pro.
[1:46:55] Pallyofhell: didnt google have glasses like that
[1:47:07] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: The quest 3 they announced alongside those Ray-Bans glasses Good thing about it though is it going to have AR and VR with VR being wireless or corded your choice
[1:47:10] Silversolar: VR is great for watching TV on a massive screen.
[1:47:14] GoreScum: Yes they had Google Glasses back when I was in High School
