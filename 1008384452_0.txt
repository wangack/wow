[2:04:14] jerseyfive: we need an affix that fears you randomly.. that sounds extreme fun!
[2:04:17] dergNwolf: they don't care about m+, that's why we always have to wait ages for mega dungeons to be ,+
[2:04:19] dergNwolf: *m+
[2:04:22] dergNwolf: and it's sad
[2:04:33] dergNwolf: speaking of which, still sad the new dungeon is not up for testing on the PTR
[2:04:43] TheCliffyShow: How about an affix that just randomly kills someone in the p[art.
[2:04:48] TheCliffyShow: party
[2:05:26] Mallaes: Slap slap slap! Clap clap clap!
[2:05:34] Shrenko: how about some other changes than just new affixes? they can do so much fun stuff with m+ besides adding new affixes....
[2:06:37] Shadowlemur01: Next month KEKW

[2:07:38] Shrenko: @remixonfire91 9.1 will keep you occupied for a day or two
[2:08:03] Shadowlemur01: if they dont add anything to korthia thats about it
[2:08:28] Shadowlemur01: I wish they would focus more on open world stuff, all i pretty much do is raid and m+ that only takes up so much time
[2:08:42] Shrenko: yep @Shadowlemur01
[2:08:54] Shadowlemur01: the art department builds these beautiful zones and then the devs dont do a damn thing with them
[2:08:58] dracullus: I don't get why you think 9.1 will be on PTR longer than 8.2, but pointless to argue over this now
[2:08:58] remixonfire91: @Shrenko  well i love doing m+s and i have raid so it will keep me occupied for a while but yeah i get what you mean

[2:14:05] Shadowlemur01: @dracullus theyre balancing, adding more leggos, adding torghast stuff, korthia, 10 boss raid, megadungeon, more covenant campaign stuff, all from home. Its gonna be in PTR longer than 8.2. They put 9.1 on PTR way before they normally would just to give people something. Theyre only at 2/10 Heroic boss testing. Its gonna be like July before 9.1

[3:22:58] MrGattz: yeah hyping up a game that isnt even close to releasing is how you kill a game
[3:23:07] DHspeedy: People shouldn't expect the raids to be as advanced as wow. that is highly unlikely.

[3:29:38] Shrenko: flying mounts are super rare in this game, like 1-2 players per server will get one
[3:29:46] Tekloth: They might as long as the content is interesting enough like they're apparently trying to make it to be
[3:29:48] MrGattz: depends how good the gameplay is. if its like wow leveling then im out at around 50 hours
[3:30:09] nature_zone: Is this Ashes of Creation?

[3:30:58] LordKain73: I'm too old to be leveling a character for 2 months to reach max level.
[3:31:01] TheUnknowing: I wouldnt even consider playing if it took that long
[3:31:02] PhoenixAuTv: @Towelliee whats this for? Just tuned in
[3:31:06] Azradath: wait how long did they say to hit max level?
[3:31:11] TODDMANFLEX: the game better be fun or it's going to be a rough 40 days killing boars n shit lmao

[3:31:34] Flashze: if its fun enough id be okay to vll  for a longer time it just depends if the game is like wow and all about end game or i gues bit like classic where the jouney matters ?
[3:31:39] Shrenko: probably gonna be so many exploits
[3:31:40] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:31:40] Masqerader: i am sure someone will find an exp exploit
[3:31:41] Sollice: @dalaraz Because he isn't that rich to fund the game to the scope he wants it at
[3:31:50] sphynx_rayne: For me. I would be bored before i get to max
[3:31:51] Valzark: i mean classic took me 12 days played at first which is over 200 hours
[3:31:54] Artivicii: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[3:31:55] nature_zone: they are trying but if you really think about it how can you beat wow
[3:32:05] sphynx_rayne: B/c he can XD
[3:32:06] dalaraz: @Sollice still too early for that kind of store offers imo
[3:32:12] AMDFusion: Kind of similar to classic wow leveling? 180+hrs?
[3:32:18] Sollice: Besides. Doesn't he want to stay rich lol
[3:32:20] xxXGorbyXxx: towlie when is ur hot tub time xD
[3:32:26] MrGattz: people will fine exploits to leveling and then the devs will ban people and then people will complain that they only did it cause leveling sucks balls and then everything will be on fire.
[3:32:26] PhoenixAuTv: Chat what game we talking about??

[3:35:46] noctridic: new world has a great foundation imo. They just need to iron out a few kinks and add some QoL
[3:35:46] Shrenko: new zones
[3:35:55] Artivicii: im looking forward to amazon lotr mmo tbh
[3:36:01] dsj0: we dont need a wow killer, just an alternative

[3:43:51] Tekloth: My bet would be rather 9.1 first and then TBC because of the world first race and the attention retail gets because of it
[3:43:52] Lamp680: P2 T5 TBC classic to challange its release.
[3:43:53] nature_zone: yeah your right

[3:46:44] Broomba: @dracullus it’s not that he doesn’t like the expansion. He wants it to be good and payoff to casual
[3:46:53] its_Steevee: do you think these other mmo's will give blizzard a little more motivation to make the game better? or are they past that?
[3:46:55] AcidSyndicate: So Tow only plays WOW , why not use older GPU driver, that hasnt the flicker porblems???
[3:46:59] PieceOfPanic: Everthing Blizzard releases lately seems unfinished lately and systems haven't seem to be very well thought through.

[3:48:10] dracullus: @Broomba yeah but my point WoW is often in low point around X.1-2 and this time we have mini drought on top of that, we have absolutely no data that it's in worst spot ever
[3:48:12] Turomori: I think one of the big reasons nothing is gonna be a "WoW Killer" is because Warcraft has been going so long, it's grown that loyalty with its players that there will always be people who stick to it
[3:48:16] hostile2715: hows ffxiv doing?

[3:48:25] dalaraz: wow keeps pushing people away though lately
[3:48:32] PieceOfPanic: Thenproblem with wow is, people already invested so much into it. If they opt out, the fear of missing out will play a major role.

[3:51:12] Sandman_88: @Osiriph yep. No expectation for the other new mmos, will try them and see if the stick. FF always stable a GOOD QUALITY content

[3:52:00] dalaraz: november will come the tbc p2 anyway so they are in a good cycle atm
[3:52:02] lanara233: If Asmon really likes a new MMO enough, he will play it when he gets bored from time to time
[3:52:03] nature_zone: will never happen
[3:52:04] Bibeln: WoW sponsored stream LUL
[3:52:05] Sandman_88: be as one and fuck them back
[3:52:12] PhoenixAuTv: Thats part of the enjoyment of playing wow, having your fav streamers in the background while you play <3
[3:52:16] nature_zone: wow lives till we die
[3:52:20] MrGattz: yeah and i dont see that happening. and even that thats just streamers and their audience which is like a fraction of the whole playerbase
[3:52:20] druidhex: I dont think a streamer would influence me playing wow
[3:52:21] subversv: asmon seems hype for new world
[3:52:31] Lightasaurus: not true, most players dont watch streams. just wont seem on the public level that its alive
[3:52:46] myfunkyself: LUL
[3:52:58] Gungre: Is your tattoo finally finished, Towelliee ? I haven't been here in a while.
[3:53:10] lilhezii: its funny tho cuz asmon, even on stream, rarely plays the ame anymore
[3:53:20] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee why are ppl keep wasting time thinkin about when WoW is dying.. it wont die, ever, til blizzard stops working on it. Its the easiest MMO to start playing, its not dying,.. ever
[3:53:43] TODDMANFLEX: i wish they would ask the 14 year veterans as well, been playing since original TBC and i have a thesis ready for submission
[3:54:24] Lokajin: @Towelliee dont get me wrong i think some of us who play classic and retail would love if they did seperate the content so it would be easier to find the content were looking for.
[3:54:29] Lokajin: But i get why they dont
[3:54:47] Masqerader: how can we make the game better?  conduit energy :P

[3:57:35] Lightasaurus: As a supervisor at my job, the idea that "just change x, y, and z" that most of the consumer base has isn't nearly as simple as just changing it. So many downstream effects

[3:57:51] Broomba: We need floppy fish on character screen towelliee
[3:57:59] gali5656: i mean it should be nerfed
[3:58:02] sinlesssinner: you know what WoW needs, no more systems, like conduits/azeritre and shit like that; just Dungeons, raids, pvp and World Quests,; and WoW would go back to being amazing
[3:58:03] chronoit: 4 minute cooldown or some shit
[3:58:04] Masqerader: mana pearls reaction was the best though LOL
[3:58:21] Sollice: Just call it the 1% Interview

[3:58:59] kenagon55: LUL
[3:59:03] Queff1995: kekew
[3:59:05] MuttonChopins: asmongold would suck at interviews
[3:59:05] MrGattz: yeah what no one wants asmon to ask ion anything
[3:59:07] Wh1rly: i dont think asmond would though
[3:59:10] Broomba: @nature_zone ion would destroy asmon
[3:59:10] nature_zone: yeah he would say some stupid shit
[3:59:12] noway137: i care about mounts LUL
[3:59:13] ShadoodHD: i'd buy popcorn for everyone in chat and watch the glory that could have happen

[3:59:35] mavrikbtw: Idk why but im just not a preach fan.
[3:59:37] its_Steevee: asmon can articulate himself when he needs
[3:59:37] OpticalSerenity: I would like to see Mes or Cdew ask him some questions from a pvp pov
[3:59:39] froodyo: I think Asmon would have some really good questions
[3:59:40] Artivicii: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[3:59:42] its_Steevee: he would ask about boob sliders lets be real

[4:00:08] Artivicii: tito KEKW
[4:00:09] Daddyknut: i disagree aswell lol
[4:00:10] Layercake: And Max wouldn't ? LUL
[4:00:13] gali5656: he'd probably ask some questions and get no real answers
[4:00:13] lanara233: Store mounts are a good example of Blizzard's greed and are exactly the kind of issue we should be talking about
[4:00:17] magemaster225: McConnel Ion interview
[4:00:17] noway137: @Towelliee but do you really think scripe/max are catering to casual players? they're 1% players
[4:00:19] froodyo: if it was Zack, like @Ikeadin said
[4:00:20] Masqerader: asmogold be like, can we get my hairstyle in the dressing room?
[4:00:30] Lightasaurus: But for competitive comps, tournies, 100%. The current M+ and raiding competitions are pretty bland
[4:00:43] AnOnYmHIT: @Towelliee  Hey man, can you please tell me the name of the nameplates addon?
[4:00:44] Broomba: Lol

[4:01:41] Lightasaurus: Metagoblin interview hype
[4:01:47] TMMOOF: o/ everyone
[4:01:52] magemaster225: but doent it say something that there's not dev who would interview asmon though. That there's not a dev that can respond to his playerbase
[4:01:59] Lightasaurus: No, but I'd like it
[4:02:00] noway137: @Towelliee asmon vs ion would be a djwheat type of interview LUL
[4:02:02] Masqerader: even preach interview was bad... like 15m of useless coven talk

[4:07:17] zilzihan: Loyal gorger farm is the bees knees
[4:07:24] Baron_Pandacula: i only really get burnt out from shadowlands WQ's since they take too long
[4:07:25] idenkaz_: tbf thats the wow the top streamer always wanted. a mythic+ service game and it is. wow like it is today was shaped by people that had too much screentime. e.r Preach. people are just fed up with that shit
[4:07:33] Eviltuna13: as a casual player who only plays 1 toon. im enjoying SL, starting to mess around with a alt now

[4:07:54] Phractured: maw of souls spamming really took a toll on my soul though. It's only gotten more tedious for me from there
[4:08:02] PieceOfPanic: I've was burned out from wow, the moment they released m+ and raids.
[4:08:02] magemaster225: but how did you do that in like MoP
[4:08:05] Shrenko: there is way too much downtime in WoW
[4:08:07] Artivicii: farming m+ all day, borrowed power is super legit
[4:08:09] TMMOOF: I need Wrath Classic
[4:08:10] noway137: except when it's artificial timeggating like anima @Towelliee
[4:08:14] nature_zone: Yeah I played so much wow in BFA and I think Shadowlands is better
[4:08:14] torridcheese3: I haven't played since WoD and I think I enjoyed WoD way more than SL.
[4:08:15] darkdestroz: @Towelliee i don´t want SL to be like WOD just log in to do the Raid etc,
[4:08:17] iceproxx: more boring GRIND doesnt mean its better i like shadowlands more there is no shit azerite grinding
[4:08:30] LSBreed: LSBreed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[4:08:32] WarReddy: Sad to say I am a mythic raid progression player but didnt even raid this launch. Missing that spark
[4:08:47] Broomba: Wow SL is much too guarded in gearing and the system
[4:08:50] kazzman90: i highly enjoyed legion. was probably my most consistent playthrough since Vanilla-Wrath.
[4:08:51] Artivicii: yup, i agree, i want that back
[4:08:56] Gorestack: that's ok for someone who plays WoW for a living, sucks for everyone else
[4:08:57] Masqerader: i liked bfa better cause I didn't have to go to town to get a fucking emissary lol
[4:09:01] PieceOfPanic: WoD was waaaaay better than Legion and SL
[4:09:07] heybake: This is the first time for me that I'm more interested in talking about WoW than actually playing WoW. This is new.
[4:09:09] BlueBeast33: So what is it about BC that makes it your favorite
[4:09:10] TMMOOF: @boomernights I swear I could die happily ever after in Wrath classic
[4:09:12] idenkaz_: i could do some actual content as a casual player in bfa because i could somewhat hold up with gear. SL? nah bro
[4:09:13] Eviltuna13: Does anyone know if i have 3-3-3-5 Covent buildings and i switch convents if i get the bonus anima tokens
[4:09:18] nature_zone: yeah your right Towelliee
[4:09:26] Baron_Pandacula: @PieceOfPanic better than legion? bro you are crazy
[4:09:27] Holysal: some players do like being "finished"
[4:09:38] iceproxx: who wants to go back to grinding islands 24/7 for 1% dmg increase and being ahead of other ppl
[4:09:56] PieceOfPanic: @boomernights naw dude..
[4:10:02] froodyo: I liked grinding for specific gear
[4:10:25] magemaster225: if the eye of the jailer didnt exist and eople could freely farm styfia it would have fixed a lot of launch stuff

[4:10:31] Wrizzik: I really hate the gating that Blizz does. Example: games like FF14 have flying built in, once you do the work
[4:10:31] lanara233: True!
[4:10:32] Artivicii: true, fuck choreghast KEKW
[4:10:36] Baron_Pandacula: any possible way for a mid point between the opinions, like you can finish your bis but still get more power from AP or something? @Towelliee
[4:10:42] PieceOfPanic: @itspetahhhh that my opinion, legion suuuuucked
[4:10:43] druidhex: I agree with you 100% BFa was better
[4:10:44] noway137: unpopular opinion, i liked islands...

[4:11:24] Masqerader: @nature_zone they're gonna be solo queue in 9.1
[4:11:25] MuttonChopins: Pannda also liked Islands @noway137
[4:11:26] Tommmay: Anyone who reckons this expansion is great hasn't played it enough
[4:11:26] Broomba: Islands gave me an option to do something to progress
[4:11:27] Artivicii: @Beyond_The_Invisible true LUL
[4:11:30] grimblymcgoo: hey towelliee! im next to you
[4:11:31] darkdestroz: @Towelliee i feel like Legion and Bfa was similar in terms of power, both used artifact power. and every lvl u got more powerful.
[4:11:32] noway137: also blizz hasnt even nerfed mythic sire right?? why not? @Towelliee
[4:11:33] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:11:38] swordart_19: who was farming islands for hours what a clowns.
[4:11:40] idenkaz_: i mean the devs themselves think KSM is casual. soo KEKW
[4:11:40] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[4:11:48] flebbooo: oh yeah that answer was awful LUL
[4:11:52] MrGattz: it was fun.. i miss it.
[4:11:54] swordart_19: @magemyway it is.
[4:11:56] noway137: yeah exactlly
[4:11:56] Masqerader: and now we got 3 phases
[4:11:58] Alexkayzz: World scenarios
[4:11:59] Artivicii: a turtle has made it to the water
[4:12:04] idenkaz_: KSM is not casual fuck off KEKW
[4:12:06] manmower: 2.0 means they all have 2 steps or more
[4:12:09] Baron_Pandacula: i miss minigames and just killing like 8 monkeys
[4:12:10] nature_zone: @Masqerader awesome thats great to hear!!!!!
[4:12:11] jarilrpg: world quest 2.0 would be fine if the reward matched the time doing the quest
[4:12:12] magemaster225: litteraly MAU stats
[4:12:14] MrGattz: @manmower or 20
[4:12:14] Layercake: gsxrPALM
[4:12:16] PieceOfPanic: I liked daily quests better, the old style.
[4:12:19] noway137: @Towelliee where did those people who said they liked WQ 2.0 come from? pretty sure he made em up
[4:12:22] Artivicii: imagine the size of his... socks
[4:12:23] grimblymcgoo: <3
[4:12:26] Mallaes: 👀
[4:12:29] Brelixs: Fire mage nerf bad?
[4:12:34] lanara233: Yeah, I much prefer the shorter WQs like race day in the ramparts
[4:12:43] Broomba: Paul Bunyan @towelliee
[4:12:49] grimblymcgoo: lol, as soon as the boss spawned i phased away from you
[4:12:56] swordart_19: @noway137 I wrote to suggestion it made 0 sense travel to thing then actually doing thing.
[4:13:01] Zettabyte: so when are you doing a transmog competition, @Towelliee ? Kappa
[4:13:14] idenkaz_: pr talk? KEKW
[4:13:16] MuttonChopins: I like that it seems like there are more WQ about not killing things this expansion, just hate that its a 3 parter
[4:13:17] Eviltuna13: When he said Holy Priest where viable cohhStare
[4:13:22] flebbooo: it's more like WQ 0.5 KEKW
[4:13:25] Broomba: WQ2 idea came from content creators ass
[4:13:32] mmrghost7: bring legion 7.3 back every is happy
[4:13:32] noctridic: it seems like the devs are trying to arbitrarily make everything in the game take longer when most people just don't have that much time to give to the game
[4:13:35] swordart_19: @noway137 imagine traveling to dungeon taking more time to doing dungeons.
[4:13:47] BlueBeast33: Blizz somehow managed to take dynamic events from GW2 and make them worse
[4:13:48] TMMOOF: It should be a mix
[4:13:48] Mallaes: The dude's back :D
[4:13:49] swordart_19: @noctridic then don't do it
[4:13:52] Alexkayzz: The blue kill the elite WQs were cool, just do it in 30 sec ez
[4:13:53] noway137: @swordart_19 exactly
[4:14:00] Korupcija_: did you follow new asmon's twitter to post gifs on his posts
[4:14:03] Masqerader: fill bar, kill elites, kill mobs, gather something for professions
[4:14:05] MuttonChopins: I dont mind playing flappy bird in WoW
[4:14:05] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:14:07] itsreptarlol: true the quests suck though in general
[4:14:10] dalaraz: im telling you,blizzard things making something annoying ,its good content
[4:14:14] noway137: but i still look at the WQs and i go nope to 90% of them

[4:14:16] Combover: Man i miss MoP. Was such a good expansion FeelsBadMan
[4:14:18] DemonicGrizz: World quest now just seem like another bunch of quest to do with not content behind them
[4:14:20] Shongoshi: I liked how for each zone I remmebered those 10 WQs that were really fast and fun to do now I think there is like 1 - 2 per zone
[4:14:22] froodyo: My biggest complaint of where wow is how much it feels like they took from Diablo 3
[4:14:27] froodyo: That is all I can think about now

[4:14:36] Broomba: Love WQ but not in SL
[4:14:36] manmower: they need more anima and higher ilevel from the worst quest drops
[4:14:49] swordart_19: @froodyo good there is classic!
[4:14:52] Korupcija_: new world quests would be ok if it gives double the anima imo
[4:15:02] Masqerader: lol
[4:15:07] liviu_81: gladdKEKW
[4:15:12] Artivicii: slootBoomer slootBoomer slootBoomer slootBoomer slootBoomer slootBoomer slootBoomer
[4:15:29] Cilir: I see you towelliee lol
[4:15:33] Canadian_Geek: Yup, ageisum is ripe with them today @Towelliee . You're an old man now
[4:15:38] Artivicii: @boomernights your name LOL KEKW
[4:15:40] PieceOfPanic: naw, they took the wrong things from d3.
[4:15:54] its_Steevee: thats their own game tho lol
[4:16:00] dalaraz: its kinda world of diablo atm
[4:16:03] Korupcija_: systems are fine, restrictions are bad
[4:16:07] lanara233: yup
[4:16:15] manmower: horadric cube instead of the runecarver
[4:16:16] swordart_19: More diablo things are Pog

[4:16:27] lilhezii: would you ever do a setup tour vid?
[4:16:36] anxietyrising: oddly, mythic + is one of the things I dislike the most about WoW anymore
[4:16:44] Nitrosulphur: Nitrosulphur subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! towRed towRed
[4:16:54] Masqerader: the one thing they should have taken from d3 with regards to rift/mythic + was adding a drop down menu to choose which key level u wanted to do
[4:16:55] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:16:57] swordart_19: @anxietyrising good don't do it 4Head
[4:17:01] lilhezii: true tru
[4:17:09] dalaraz: m+ is good content but it hurts wow badly nowadays,for multiple reasons
[4:17:13] Zeijun: and why did they backtrack and implement dailies again?
[4:17:20] PieceOfPanic: They should've focused on the way items work together, effects and compiling your own build. The m+ is good as stand alone, but in wow it messes with the game. On top of that m+ gets tedious and grundy.
[4:17:21] Kaczy_: @Towelliee is there any date for Ashes of Creation premier?
[4:17:21] Broomba: Just watch his stream when new gaming room is done
[4:17:24] PieceOfPanic: grindy*
[4:17:26] noway137: @Towelliee id do more m+ if they buffed anima...
[4:17:28] Wrizzik: M+: "I want to raid but I hate people"
[4:17:29] its_Steevee: yeah i disliked greater rift grinding and dislike mythic plus grinding
[4:17:33] Sarocus: I'm a big fan of M+ and i dont even do them
[4:17:34] noway137: getting 35 anima for 40 mins? nope...
[4:17:35] BlueBeast33: I'm the same...I preferred older heroics from previous expansions like Cata
[4:17:39] druidhex: ima  huge M+ - 350 timed +10 keys so far
[4:17:41] Demkie: What’s happening this week Towelliee ? Big week inc ?
[4:17:44] Shongoshi: I liked it in Legion, not anymore :(
[4:17:47] Artivicii: in legion, i did m+ for 9 months straight. that shit was so good
[4:17:49] noctridic: I dislike that the end of run item level from a +15 is the same as a weekly box from a +5. It really makes me feel like there isnt a point to running more than 1 dungeon a week
[4:18:00] Broomba: Love m+ but SL doesn’t help gear leveling
[4:18:02] Mallaes: I counted a few times how many Kill a dude WQs were in Legion and how many were in BfA. For Legion, excluding Broken Shore and Argus, I counted 6. For BfA, excluding Nazjatar, there were 19.
[4:18:05] swordart_19: We know who to hate for no loot on m+ chat.We can blame all raid loggers in chat.
[4:18:09] Necrom93: I despise M+, but I imagine I'm in the minority nowadays.
[4:18:14] Phin3asGage: Would mythic plus be good in classic?
[4:18:17] flebbooo: true
[4:18:20] aevd: technically challenge modes did a bit of that *adjusts glasses*
[4:18:23] BlueBeast33: Heroics were relevant through TBC though
[4:18:28] PieceOfPanic: I hate going to an m+ for 2 years, farming the exact same item with few months in between.
[4:18:30] BlueBeast33: because of badges
[4:18:30] BubbaChubbs420: i don't like the mythic + culture
[4:18:37] manmower: Torghast torments, wouldn't those be better if they were applied to the mobs to do unique things?
[4:18:38] Coox69: @Swoop_Scoop hell no imagine BRD lmao
[4:18:39] gravlaxxx: i like that you can do m+ just for the weekly, or you can push and do it regularly
[4:18:47] dalaraz: m+ has pros and cons,cons though are getting amplified atm cause of rewards issues,balancing issues aplitting the community etc
[4:18:48] Zettabyte: don't like affixes FeelsBadMan
[4:18:52] PieceOfPanic: Challenge modes was way better than m+
[4:18:52] J0rki: oh hell no
[4:18:54] Artivicii: im gonna try 4Head
[4:18:56] druidhex: I am
[4:18:57] dimofodi: I'm lucky if I'm going to do +15 for a mount
[4:18:57] Korupcija_: KEKW
[4:18:58] oSpaced: no way
[4:18:58] remixonfire91: o/ Kappa
[4:18:59] Havykk: Participation doesnt work as a good indicator when you need to do it for gear
[4:19:07] Broomba: What?
[4:19:08] druidhex: ShowOfHands
[4:19:08] gravlaxxx: the only people that need the teleport are those that do 20s
[4:19:13] noway137: @Towelliee or just go engineer for free teleport toi each zone...
[4:19:14] LucidAntics: its for completionists
[4:19:14] TheCliffyShow: *Raises hand* If it exists, I want it.
[4:19:15] J0rki: mists challenge transmog set was great imo
[4:19:16] hectabit: Doing +20 pugs looks awful
[4:19:21] Artivicii: yea that reward shouldnt even be considered a reward
[4:19:23] dimofodi: Should have been a +10 reward, +15 mount, +20 a transmog set or something
[4:19:24] froodyo: I like the concept, I just don't like the AOE huge pull fest - I think it's just a different type of gameplay that I like, a little slower and more methodical then what mythic+ has felt like
[4:19:24] Shyme_J: The problem is that blizzard got too comfortable with m+ idea, wow player will always expect more and and always want something new
[4:19:25] flebbooo: i'll try but i wouldn't go big dick for it unless there was some sweet tmog aswell
[4:19:30] Coox69: ppl who do 20 keys wont do that for the teleport they do it regardless
[4:19:32] Artivicii: more like a participation trophy
[4:19:34] dalaraz: i mean beta is getting over at 9.2
[4:19:40] Korupcija_: that sounds like a reward for completing a dungeon on +2
[4:19:42] dalaraz: game will be good by then hopefully
[4:19:42] froodyo: but I love the scaling difficulty, love it
[4:19:52] dehash1: a transmog set would be way nicer, like the elite set in pvp
[4:19:53] druidhex: Im already about to do +17s - with 9.1 gear and leggos ill get my +20
[4:19:53] Cilir: The one thing I find silly is them putting in a speed run ladder for torgahst
[4:19:55] Masqerader: I teleport to a dungeon all the time, I wait for a summon
[4:19:59] Alexkayzz: I suppose the teleports are character only? Or account unlock?
[4:20:01] BubbaChubbs420: it's not like it is going to save you tons of time
[4:20:04] LucidAntics: They wouldnt give a huge reward for +20s cuz they realize a lot of players cant even get KSM so why would they make it some grand reward?
[4:20:07] Artivicii: @Masqerader LUL
[4:20:10] manmower: they should update the ingame m+ interface to tell the player more about progress
[4:20:16] looseone: looseone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 101 months, currently on a 101 month streak! towHAMUP
[4:20:26] instructOS: io score....garbage app
[4:20:33] Korupcija_: I think ccing is boring, even on classic people just go go go
[4:20:34] magemaster225: dungeon score
[4:20:37] Scoodles91: dungeon score maybe
[4:20:38] Artivicii: the higher my io, the bigger my epeen
[4:20:51] BlueBeast33: Yeah...I don't like timed dungeons
[4:20:51] derElten: towHAMUP towBleedpurple
[4:20:52] Skobble: are they implementing the io-score ingame?
[4:20:53] Broomba: Mid maxing
[4:20:57] swordart_19: @artivicii factually true
[4:20:57] Holysal: @Skobble yes
[4:21:02] Tommmay: it's basically rating for pve
[4:21:07] Phractured: thats even over in tbc classic. I plan on pulling everything
[4:21:09] PieceOfPanic: I did the WoD challenge mode, it was fucking amazing. M+ in comparison is tedious, forced and repetitive.
[4:21:12] noway137: @Towelliee unless you're going +25 keys yeah
[4:21:13] druidhex: We still CC on inspiring weeks
[4:21:20] Skobble: @Holysal but with no different rewards?
[4:21:21] DragonofWolves: Sooo i got some renown catching up to do. im guessing the cap has gone up a ton as ive been away from a few months
[4:21:23] swordart_19: Boomers in chat back in my day LUL
[4:21:26] Artivicii: i only mage my mage CC
[4:21:30] Holysal: @Skobble just the +20 ones
[4:21:31] Artivicii: make my mage*
[4:21:33] Masqerader: CC suffers from the fact some CC doesn't work on certain mobs so if u got a dungeon full of undead you're limited to what u can do to them
[4:21:39] froodyo: agree, thats just what I miss lol - it's all good it's just evolved
[4:21:41] Scarhearth: slow methodical dungeons are  archaic

[4:22:03] Korupcija_: interrupt order
[4:22:04] Artivicii: stun rotations make a 15 feel like a 12
[4:22:09] magemaster225: on the other side, it feels like they want to make everything a speedrun which sucks in a game without a pause button
[4:22:16] Masqerader: ya, rebellious fist....
[4:22:24] Alexkayzz: U still pre CC i guess on inspiring
[4:22:46] Brodih_: Qhaz_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[4:22:50] manmower: were dungeons more fun when you had to use strategy and CC?
[4:22:59] Artivicii: bruh those TBC heroic dungeons mobs who hold a twohander
[4:23:01] Artivicii: fuck those guys
[4:23:12] Alexkayzz: what's written on that bottle?
[4:23:15] Molvonos: Or the whole group of mobs jump away and throw lances at you, like that fucking horrible pack in Spires.
[4:23:19] Korupcija_: I'm drinking wine and coke
[4:23:23] RagingPunk: towShappens
[4:23:29] Artivicii: they were immune to CC too
[4:23:33] Phractured: to be fair we used to cc in tbc because you pulled a 4 pack, 1 feared, 1 healed, 1 mana drained and 1 silenced. It was much more chaotic to not cc if you didnt have crazy aoe

[4:25:05] Masqerader: Havoc got some nice buffs too
[4:25:14] BubbaChubbs420: i thought rapture got nerfed for Aff locks?
[4:25:23] noway137: @Towelliee mechagon?
[4:25:27] Molvonos: You going drain soul or SB build, @OG_Fear ?
[4:25:29] BlueBeast33: Cata heroics were so good though
[4:25:33] OG_Fear: Yea Aff locks basically got reverted to a Legion build somewhat
[4:25:37] Ponickz: I kinda like the torghast talent tree thingy in 9.1
[4:25:39] Redbearded16: @towelliee been gone for a week or so. What’s the big wow news? 9.1 this week?
[4:25:40] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: i hated cata heroic dungos back then they where a pain in the ass
[4:26:00] dalaraz: idd love 5mans be harder thah the m+ era
[4:26:01] Artivicii: bigbig
[4:26:04] OG_Fear: @Molvonos Idk yet thats why the testing will be a good benchmark not sure if the Drain Soul gains enough value in the exe phase to be worth taking yet
[4:26:07] geokouts: i prefer TW Cata to TW BC
[4:26:07] Masqerader: but imagine having a dungeon where you need CC but you brought a classes that can't CC those mobs because they're undead or something, that just feels bad
[4:26:08] BlueBeast33: I got the meta achievement for Cata heroics before the nerf...I never understood the complaints
[4:26:10] gundamzeros01: @Towelliee a question , do you recomend Wow for a casual (like me ) who work full time , only exp is on private wotlk serv , prob play 1~3 hours a day and more hours on weekends . Apologize if u get alot of this questions
[4:26:11] RagingPunk: Pog
[4:26:13] HammerD1337: pre patch news or pre patch release?

[4:34:36] theegoomba: @Towelliee for real though after that last interview with preach ithink the design team isnt getting accurate information alot of their misgivings he gave the answer that internally they werent seeing these things
[4:34:48] quakegoogl: towWar
[4:34:52] MrGattz: can i answer that?
[4:34:54] 2MakeMe: I was surprised jeff kaplan was only getting paid 140k.. felt low for such a position
[4:34:55] MrGattz: lol
[4:35:10] TMMOOF: What was Ions position at blizzard during the wrath days? they were making bank when they had 15m dubs

[4:35:22] Masqerader: Well at Blizzard....
[4:35:24] manmower: jeff kaplan makes more than us? no wonder he didn't feel motivated
[4:35:29] manmower: oh less than us

[4:35:39] zilzihan: I think the answer is git gud
[4:35:40] ShadoodHD: rippy dippy
[4:35:43] manmower: in CA that is not much
[4:35:46] 2MakeMe: Google
[4:35:51] Wrizzik: $140k may have been his salary but I guarantee he has loads of stock
[4:36:08] Mr_Hasselhoff: In California that's not that much. It's decent salary but not that much
[4:36:13] stijn0416: activision stonks
[4:36:15] pixxelina: true
[4:36:19] 2MakeMe: He probably got blizzard balance
[4:36:26] lovecult85: get a free char transfer from alliance to horde every month :D
[4:36:29] Soproatlol: probably took the stock option
[4:36:38] manmower: he left with all of his money in Overwatch 2 stock
[4:36:46] Sollice: 140k sounds low for game dev
[4:36:48] Turomori: started playing in prepatch so never gone to a new patch, is 202 ilvl good enough to start 9.1 stuff?
[4:36:49] Ezekyler: Kaplan took bobby's cut before leave KEKW
[4:37:36] Twigz_KC: Twigz_KC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:37:44] MrGattz: that does seem really low
[4:37:53] DecayedmiNt: I really don't get why people fuss over devs starting to leave Blizzard. It's such a volatile industry. Most don't even stay put for a couple years, let alone 10+
[4:37:53] MrGattz: especially for a company like blizzard
[4:37:59] crrdsh: gawd that's nothing
[4:37:59] LeonardLongNips: man that seems so shitty. All those years of experience and time to move up the ladder and thats it.
[4:37:59] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:38:10] LeonardLongNips: Other positions in other fields make much more
[4:38:12] crrdsh: I'm glad I switched careers
[4:38:19] BubbaChubbs420: and a lawyer LuL
[4:38:23] Masqerader: game director of git gud
[4:38:29] Sarocus: Think Cali is about 30% higher than the average. WQith double the cost of living
[4:38:38] dimofodi: if you think the face of wow doesnt make a higher salary you'd be a fool
[4:38:45] Aidler: 100k is nothing in Cali
[4:38:52] crrdsh: sad thing is you get that pay then you have no guarantee for longevity
[4:38:53] Wrizzik: @Bubbachubbs420 yes but he doesn't get lawyer salary on top of his game salary
[4:39:02] 2MakeMe: @sarocus thats bout right, cost of living is rough in cali
[4:39:04] heisenderp1337: isnt that even more alarming then?
[4:39:09] Shrenko: its hard to leave something you made from ground up
[4:39:14] crrdsh: skip the game dev, go healthcare
[4:39:18] sifer007: he was the founder
[4:39:30] theDirtyon3: they are old dudes that want to semi retire
[4:39:33] Masqerader: these guys are in their 50s or near it, time to move on and do other things, some people might just wanna be like I made millions, i am gonna relax
[4:39:39] MrGattz: some people just want a change of scenery
[4:39:44] Jokervenom1978: Its crazy those devs stayed for as long as they did.
[4:39:45] MrGattz: doesnt matter how much you are getting paid
[4:39:51] usfnate152: have yall never had a real job? You get burned out after years and years
[4:39:52] dimofodi: If done right or in a well enough position, moving on should be pretty common, they should be able to "retire" at that point
[4:40:00] 2MakeMe: Honestly in order to get a promotion and better pay, you have to move on
[4:40:10] biirrd: you need ppl to move on, otherwise you end up with shit lite shadowlands. Ppl get blind and forget who the player is.
[4:40:16] 2MakeMe: I would have gone to mike as well
[4:40:18] LeonardLongNips: Man 90-110k/year is nothing these days. CT cost of living is so high it wouldn't get you much here.
[4:40:19] Arsannic: Most funny part is, they don´t need to work at all at this point.
[4:40:35] ManiacalCarl: Eh, I've worked in the same career/industry for over 15 years, but I've moved "jobs" within it every 3-4 years.
[4:40:35] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:40:36] Artivicii: makes sense
[4:40:36] Sarocus: Staying at the same company forever died in the 1980s. Gotta move on at ome point
[4:40:39] MrGattz: @biirrd i mean thats not why SL exists but the general concept is correct.
[4:40:43] Valyou3: Didnt they do a lootbox where your fired or not fired
[4:40:47] magemaster225: If you had to read a tell-all book from one of the guys who left recently who would you pick
[4:40:52] BubbaChubbs420: burn out
[4:40:57] 2MakeMe: @leonardlongnips exactly especially if u want to buy a house in the future
[4:41:15] Masqerader: kinda like sports, some players stay with a team their whole career, others go to Tampa and make their old coach look bad
[4:41:32] sifer007: Ion next

[4:42:59] tocu: @Towelliee all you need to know he was a dick is know his EQ name was furor no joke
[4:42:59] Zapotek_S: is this about Alex ?:D
[4:43:04] magemaster225: his drunk twitter rant explaining how WoD Archimonde was the same as BC archimonde got us into this mess
[4:43:19] jarilrpg: Steve seems like a MUCH better fit for creative director, seems more passionate about it

[4:44:58] Sollice: Sorry was doing a run in Outriders. 144k for someone like Ion would be extremely low. I would say he makes north of 200 with his experience and seniority. Also, your comment about people leaving because they are in charge is 100% a huge issue. I had at one point 32 or so direct reports. It sucked. Now I have leads/managers below and its better

[5:58:13] ahla03: Is there something we should look forward to in prepatch? I haven't followed it closely
[5:58:16] dalaraz: its not official guys. seems like it though
[5:58:31] SilkeySmooth: I'd expect an announcement this week
[5:58:47] Chiraakitteh: so with the state of retail, is it worth starting it right now? I haven’t played WoW since the end of Legion. I would also probably be playing some classic.
[5:58:59] Chiraakitteh: Opinions anyone?
[5:59:24] Toxarina: damn that Sharma looked so good 👍

[6:01:14] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[6:01:18] papaterb: get hunter boosted to 20 takes like 3hours
[6:01:32] ironandwine9: can you still get boosts in pre patch? mage aoe gets nerfed i think
[6:01:33] Brethren2K: mechagon quest hub was the worst laid out daily area I have ever seen out of any expansion. Gating flying with it was horrible.
[6:01:40] Shurn_82: oo the diablo 2 musics
[6:01:47] Octavian360: @Towelliee do you think they will announce the TBC deluxe this Tues as well?
[6:01:49] ironandwine9: soft cap at 20 targets
[6:01:49] CritcobainTV: it applies to prepatch yeah
[6:01:51] gamernick410: Mages can still boost @ironandwine9
[6:01:54] zyppeli: You can boost in prepatch just fine
[6:01:55] Outlaw_Jester: Yes
[6:01:56] RoyalFrag: yeah but mages will still be fine
[6:01:56] ironandwine9: not nearly as fast
[6:01:58] NILLme: its nerfed but still viable, just gonna take longer to kill mobs
[6:02:09] Outlaw_Jester: but it wont matter anyways....
[6:02:10] Wrizzik: @hestar Blizz updated leveling xp in TBC when it was retail. Tow is saying they may add that in Classic
[6:02:11] gamernick410: That’s not how it works @ironandwine9
[6:02:24] gamernick410: There is no cap on the blizzard slow
[6:02:30] Brethren2K: The layout and chromie stuff was just horrible feeling. I mean it was all doable sure
[6:02:33] gamernick410: You can slow 1000 mobs
[6:02:42] rsimpson105: Man I did not like mechadong island
[6:02:43] dalaraz: all those changes wikl go live only if we have to download the bc client to play the prepatch
[6:02:47] gamernick410: You use flamestrike to kill and blizz to slow
[6:02:50] ironandwine9: but trying to kill 350 mobs at the same time in mara might be tough at a 20 target damage soft cap :P
[6:02:50] Kinghorn: we will find out when prepatch happens
[6:03:01] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[6:03:09] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Not bad considering Torghast is still borked. Blizzard still hasn't fixed a bug where Anima Powers don't change after you restart a run.
[6:03:14] gamernick410: There is videos it only takes 2 minutes longer @ironandwine9
[6:03:17] NILLme: its still the same just takes longer
[6:03:23] gamernick410: It’s only 2 minutes longer for mara
[6:03:23] ironandwine9: hm hm. well thats good news
[6:03:29] dwarfmagee: AoE cap is capt at dmg not at how many it hits
[6:03:35] Brethren2K: just felt like the different vendors and stuff was just overly complex for no reason. It didnt feel enjoyable in any way.  Other than the patch length ive been really enjoying Shadowlands.
[6:03:41] gamernick410: You use flamestrike which isn’t capped at all
[6:03:42] Brethren2K: Brethren2K subscribed with Prime. 
[6:03:56] SpilledMelk: if 5 mages all aoe the same 20+ mobs how does the aoe cap work?
[6:04:17] Shurn_82: its per person
[6:04:27] DHspeedy: how much xp do you get from 1 round of boost in ZG, anyone got some calculation on that?
[6:04:28] gamernick410: The dmg cap is only for blizzard
[6:04:32] NovaSun84: Oh we on that xp grind.  How did WPL finish off on Friday night?
[6:04:47] Wrizzik: incoming mob train to Towelliee

[6:17:17] Holysal: yeah hes not going any where but the coach
[6:17:23] DecayedmiNt: @jkitchin75 Yup, especially the sidecar version of it...they literally just hold onto a rope and bar.
[6:17:35] zscrubtastic: the lions can have him as backup
[6:17:37] SonofHorus82: He even spoke to NBC while at the Derby yesterday and said it upset him that this report came out and that he loves Green Bay. Chat needs to get caught up with the news.
[6:17:40] mavericks312: defensively he could
[6:17:42] eltis90: Uff you f a t
[6:17:43] oSpaced: its a move to deflect blame of not winning more super bowls

[6:17:50] CoryWarmane: Steelers, Eagles, Carolina
[6:17:55] ChimmyNeutron: Disagree, Denver has just as good of a roster.
[6:17:57] mavericks312: the saints
[6:17:58] critin87: i know Denver would love to have him
[6:17:59] Aravarth: Tight End Kreygasm Kappa
[6:17:59] oSpaced: neither niners or pats have anything to give for him it wont happen
[6:18:00] Laluzmia: team that he would like to go would be NO,SF is better then the DB
[6:18:03] mr_drewc26: Coach, GM; defense
[6:18:10] cbiskit89: @Laluzmia took them to nfc championship where the run def was trash then they draft love when arodg gave no indication of wanting to retire then he wins mvp... i'd fire the gm and keep aaron
[6:18:12] CoryWarmane: big RB from Alabama
[6:18:18] Wrizzik: Ben's leg gonna fall off. I'm calling it.
[6:18:27] Glozki: najee is a monster thats a good pickup for them
[6:18:28] mr_drewc26: Those teams are good… aaron just always complains
[6:18:31] Fugazi811: Our OL isn't that great tho (Steelers)
[6:18:31] Holysal: that division is tough
[6:18:32] CoryWarmane: Ben needs to stay healthy
[6:18:36] Ponickz: That bama running back though
[6:18:40] mavericks312: any team with a defense would be better then the packers
[6:19:05] mr_drewc26: GB always complains
[6:19:10] Kaihrn: lmao
[6:19:13] mr_drewc26: Defense, coach!

[6:20:54] darkscream181: Your phone is always listening

[6:21:38] Aaradin: its their servers they can do whatever they want
[6:21:43] wednesjae: its their game
[6:21:44] Wildside1177: More corporate over-reach in the name of "greater good"/
[6:21:45] TMMOOF: Your playing their game lol
[6:21:54] NovaSun84: Depends on if its 2 party consent...
[6:21:56] Shurn_82: who fucking cares, your life isnt that important lol
[6:22:00] Kaihrn: yeh i think in France its a no no
[6:22:02] BadXo: I'm pretty sure they just place it in their TOS - if you don't agree with it, play another game
[6:22:03] Wrizzik: these same people are already having their chat analyzed by Discord servers and just don't know it
[6:22:08] dalaraz: its on tos 100%
[6:22:08] NovaSun84: but If you are playing on RIOT's servers, you already accepted that permission
[6:22:10] Holysal: its in the TOS and the players agree though
[6:22:12] alundrius: the terms of use invalidates your riights for the most part
[6:22:21] DrakhanGaming: i dont want riot knowing what i ate for breakfast foxfigScream
[6:22:21] wraaith: wont it be down to an end user agreement as in if u play this game u agree to our terms
[6:22:24] mavericks312: it will be in the ToS you don't like it don't play the game
[6:22:24] SpoonManes: yerp tos
[6:22:25] Broomba: some states have laws where you have to have their consent
[6:22:26] Zazie123: When you sign up for the game, you give away your rights to privacy on their voice coms
[6:22:35] MetallicusGaming: I mean what does it hurt? It's not like you're going to mention that you're a serial killer IRL to someone LUL
[6:22:38] dalaraz: its prolly on tos and you agree with it
[6:22:39] Chiraakitteh: They have the ability to not play the game
[6:22:47] DecayedmiNt: It's legal since it's private property, as well as you also signing the rights away in the EULA and TOS signing
[6:22:51] TMMOOF: Just like how if you have a drivers license you already agreed to a blood test in the event you are pulled over for drunk driving, gg tos
[6:23:04] NovaSun84: dead to rights LULW
[6:23:06] SnakeDoctor09: its legal as long they tell you that you're being recorded, which they just did
[6:23:22] Kickstand_: depends on the State some require informed consent from all parties some only needs one person
[6:23:26] Alexkayzz: I read ToS 3 times before playing a game and I also have my lawyer check it
[6:23:29] Kaihrn: um Facebook hello tick and give them rights to everything you do lol
[6:23:31] Shurn_82: @TMMOOF most places your drivers licence isnt even your own property, hence why police can ask for it, and you must oblige
[6:23:45] TMMOOF: @TMMOOF I like your big brain :)
[6:23:46] dalaraz: @Alexkayzz you are 1 of a kind :p
[6:23:56] hapsthehamster: Hmm it would not be legal in eu if there is any personal info because of the gdpr as they need to show how they handle that info and only store the info that they 100% need
[6:24:01] Broomba: you need Soda's brother the lawyer to run those agreements before clicking I agree when playing a game
[6:24:04] mavericks312: @kickstand_ if it's in the ToS and ppl ignored it then that's in them
[6:24:10] NovaSun84: Ever since I installed FB originally back in like 2009... I knew everything I did was public when I touched my keyboard and mouse.. FeelsBadMan

[6:25:16] Jynt334: Plus, if you are playing with friends, aren't you usually on discord?
[6:25:17] Shurn_82: @Towelliee TAHT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET
[6:25:17] hapsthehamster: I think its fine they do it to make the game less toxic but some of the laws around that area are somewhat crazy
[6:25:17] Wildside1177: Aren't you being cynical assuming that everyone who objects is evil.  Maybe they just really value individualism and privacy.
[6:25:17] byrdeen45: i tell everyone my stock information  they better not share that
[6:25:18] SamDavidsin: wait woh, who is this sandy?

[6:27:08] mavericks312: I'm all for removing the toxicity
[6:27:14] mmrghost7: dota ??? its the mother of toxin
[6:27:17] Aravarth: Dota2 and League are cancer AF
[6:27:20] NovaSun84: Dota just dumps all the toxic people into their own queueu

[6:28:07] mavericks312: most of league toxicity is from the text chat
[6:28:09] mmrghost7: bro they add league the voice come , the game is done
[6:28:26] Chiraakitteh: @dhspeedy Or maybe they want to avoid lawsuits
[6:28:38] PimpinMuffins: League does have voice coms
[6:28:43] PimpinMuffins: but you don't have to join it
[6:28:54] mmrghost7: no it doesnt

[6:29:19] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee I might as well take a break from retail until catch-up mechanics are figured out and implemented. I'm about ready to unsub.
[6:29:19] remixonfire91: league does not have voice comms , you have voice comms for party not in solo queue
[6:29:21] Shurn_82: painting yourself blue and hjaving an orgy with that girl smurf?
[6:29:22] MuttonChopins: probably was dota, Riot loves smurfs
[6:29:23] DHspeedy: if they want to stop toxicity they gotta learn to not team me up with people who are 10 times less skilled then me.
[6:29:28] NovaSun84: But to double check, League is the same company as Valorant right?  They both Riot
[6:29:31] Shurn_82: Khashi lean is gooooood
[6:29:34] Soknar91: and they are banning EVERY acc who smurfs
[6:29:46] Democritus33: @Towelliee big companies also track micro actions, not just chat interaction also they could sell the data to other institutions
[6:29:47] Soknar91: even your main account
