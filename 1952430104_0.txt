[0:45:10] reaperblade93: WoW won‚Äôt change. It will be on a separate sub , I hope
[0:45:36] ThtzGnarly: Bro WoW on controller with action combat will be fire. Can‚Äôt wait to tier skip to my legendary weapon.
[0:45:47] jmalmin: wow token earns blizzard to much money to remove it :)
[0:45:48] CardinalTX: wow is still a cash cow....it wont change
[0:46:04] reaperblade93: True
[0:46:37] Broomba: reddit is bad for the mind, mmmm ok
[0:47:05] mavericks312: Man said wow on console would be fire lol nah you would be insta ignored by the pc community
[0:47:07] nilachip: !time
[0:47:07] Moobot: @nilachip Towelliee's time is currently 05:17:49 PST
[0:47:10] Yagr6: xbox does have mouse and keyboard support i wonder if it would ever come to game pass? funny thing is skyrim on xbox has downloadable mods / add ons.
[0:47:12] Molvonos: lol
[0:47:12] nilachip: !timer
[0:47:27] Molvonos: It's not gonna be on gamepass.
[0:47:34] Broomba: wow with controller KEKW
[0:47:38] Molvonos: Again, that'd be a profit loss.
[0:47:52] mavericks312: @yagr6 nah tokens make way to much money, also the add on factor
[0:47:55] Molvonos: And yea, you wanna get hard declined for everything?  Play with a controller.
[0:48:08] reaperblade93: I think wow being available on console is a good thing, means more ppl can play the way they want to, Idk if blizz will ever do it
[0:48:08] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:48:16] CardinalTX: Hmmmm which melee should i gear   Ret pally or frost dk?    guess i can do both huh
[0:48:21] mavericks312: Ms is gonna let actiblizz run on it‚Äôs own for a few years and see if there‚Äôs issues first that‚Äôs how these things go
[0:48:21] Molvonos: @dadandragons Are you trying too hard to troll?  Because it's starting to get real old.
[0:48:30] Yagr6: skyrim has add ons on console @mavericks312
[0:48:32] Broomba: @reaperblade93 WTF????
[0:48:33] jmalmin: The problem with porting wow to console would be the strings of code in this game. You got old code mixing with new code which would be a nightmare to fix to port over to console. So its not going to happen.
[0:48:33] MoonwalkingAngel: sell your xbox and buy a cjrrent 500 dollar pc if you wanne play wow so bad
[0:48:50] mavericks312: @reaperblade93 it means if the pc community sees your on console you get ignored cause we know you don‚Äôt have adin support
[0:48:52] Yagr6: @mavericks312 also xbox does support keyboard and mouse
[0:49:28] Molvonos: Ya'll saying WoW Could be on Console because Skyrim does, don't seem to comprehend that WoW was never made to be on console, and porting it over would be a logisitical nightmare, compared to Skyrim or even FFXIV.
[0:49:30] mavericks312: @yagr6 sure but 99% of pc players are gonna ignore a console player if we can see that‚Äôs what your on
[0:49:44] reaperblade93: Yeah there are some issues but other mmos did it , like final fantasy? Isnt that game on console too?
[0:49:46] Molvonos: And it would not 'be easy' to make it playable on console.
[0:49:47] mavericks312: @dadandragons clearly you haven‚Äôt played DF
[0:49:52] Mecabeast: Imagine thinking current wow isn't casual
[0:50:01] Yagr6: @mavericks312 nah bc more than likely i would move to console
[0:50:03] DunzoCD: i hope they put wow on console just so i can decline all of them from groups for being console players
[0:50:08] Faregon: @jmalmin did some wow dev say wow on console never happening due to 15years of spagetthifying the code ?
[0:50:12] mavericks312: @reaperblade93 other mmos were designed for console WoW wasn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not that hard to understand
[0:50:21] MoonwalkingAngel: ff14 was espacialy made for console
[0:50:25] LadyNaara: weow its too early for this
[0:50:36] mavericks312: @yagr6 that doesn‚Äôt change the fact consolenplayers would get belle ignored
[0:50:47] reaperblade93: Ok ok I get it , you just want pc wow not console LUL
[0:50:49] Alsparq: word of warcraft 2 is coming and it may be on console
[0:50:50] Broomba: Everquest and RS do fine on pc and they are not on console
[0:50:51] Faregon: @reaperblade93 are you comparing a game developed with console in mind vs a game that never knew console existed 10years into its live ?
[0:50:51] Molvonos: I dont have the patience for shitty trolls.
[0:50:58] Yagr6: some boomer take that wow cant be on console..
[0:51:09] Yagr6: u seen the specs on these new consoles?
[0:51:12] Molvonos: It cannot, in its current iteration, be on console.
[0:51:21] mavericks312: This WoW to console stuff may be worse then there metzen news recently lol
[0:51:34] truckguy: the cost of them to put wow on console i could see it costing more than what the return investment would be , wow is such an old game that they would have to start from ground up
[0:51:34] Faregon: @Yagr6 is not about specs, is about the game not being easy to port to console? can you reverse 15years of coding to make it work on console?
[0:51:43] DunzoCD: my man doesnt understand how coding works
[0:51:55] LadyNaara: exactly
[0:51:59] mavericks312: @yagr6 bro the series S can‚Äôt run bg3 you want it to run wow?
[0:52:03] gho5tfinger: lol chat is spicy
[0:52:07] ravimatrixx: good morning towelliee
[0:52:08] reaperblade93: Dang I didn‚Äôt mean to start a war LUL , forgive my ignorance
[0:52:09] itsDets: Morning T
[0:52:17] CardinalTX: Metzen was brought back because he has round a way to wipe our memory and make wow classic new again........
[0:52:17] Yagr6: @Faregon lol microsoft got the resources bro
[0:52:23] CardinalTX: found
[0:52:26] reaperblade93: And I also prefer playing wow on pc
[0:52:28] Molvonos: That doesnt mean they'll want to waste money on a profit loss.
[0:52:28] Broomba: @gho5tfinger no chat bathing in reddit crap
[0:52:30] Molvonos: My guy.
[0:52:30] Sbopz: Won on console would be nive
[0:52:34] Sbopz: Nice
[0:52:38] reaperblade93: Good morning sir
[0:52:41] CardinalTX: Morning T
[0:52:42] Codeblue2023: Good Morning Roberto
[0:52:45] jmalmin: They did not mentioned the code only that it wont appear on consoles. I do know that Blizzard have said many times they will not port wow to console. But the code would be a big issue. Look at Diablo 3 on Console and PC inventory system would be a issue. Also to many buttons for a controller.
[0:52:49] Faregon: @Faregon kekw if you think they gonna do shit, what resources are you talkin about ? the massive succes starfield that was or what ?
[0:52:49] Cicvara1: Doing great, hope youre having a good start to your day, @towelliee

[0:53:27] gho5tfinger: @Towelliee where are the jerseys for sale?
[0:53:28] Molvonos: @angahax Regular Classic is Classic.  Classic+ is just Retail with shittier graphics.

[1:29:18] Sollice: Listen...when there is cocaine involved everyday is Saturday
[1:29:30] zysmos: I don't know why people have this wet dream about wow being on console
[1:29:34] smashwow: towel let their memes be dreams dude
[1:29:36] Karbonn: FFXIV has a large console base but I don't see it working for WoW.
[1:29:39] Ealdfox: Can't wait to heal with a controller on Xbox Kappa
[1:29:47] ArcaneSyntax: It would have to be a separate environment, there is no way a console player could keep up to a PC player on retail

[1:30:16] Eshel: as a friend used to say... "people are born stupid and getting dumber every day" LOL
[1:30:17] LadyNaara: Its no abou if the console can run it, pretty sure they can. The problem is in the code. WOW wasnt originally plan with consoles in mind, unlikes FFXIV
[1:30:24] Molvonos: @ThorH13 Would be a huge profit loss.

[2:31:34] raldrik: and the story quests work on all the versions. Friggen amazon wasting another big launch on huge bugs
[2:31:39] valianya: They'll be running 4 versions of WoW.  Cata is too different from WotLK.  Retail, HC, Wrath, Cata
[2:31:49] snake_like: I think cata classic would still flop because that's when raiding started to become "hard". most people i know play classic because it's easy
[2:31:51] ItsNobbie: WotLK Classic will be done in a few months. Cata Classic ofc makes sense, and for the neckbeards, they can always setup a few WotLK Era servers
[2:31:53] Treehop: Treehop subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:31:54] Krait06: Salu
[2:32:15] ThorH13: They should have every Expansion server and with the option to transfer up on a character if a person wants to play classic to nax and the clone their character to BC the up to sunwell clone to Wrath ect ect I find it strange they got rid of BC
[2:32:31] Eviltuna13: Did heroic UP and the blue drake dropped and someone said great it drops here but not in retail cohhLUL
[2:32:34] SynysterCraig: Dude, you got a bad ass skin.

[2:32:41] Thoreya: brain hurts

[2:33:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Classic+ could just be a season with one storyline, true
[2:33:15] Krait06: They just going to announce season of mastery 2
[2:33:37] ArcaneSyntax: The classic team isn't big enough to do a ton of content.
[2:33:38] notColt45: agreed
[2:33:41] Broomba: watch classic + will be a new character creation screen @towelliee KEKW
[2:33:43] Shrenko: they could hire Turtle wow devs
[2:33:46] Shrenko: SeemsGood
[2:34:09] SynysterCraig: PvP at all?
[2:34:12] ArcaneSyntax: I think classic+ is like remixed classic, maybe changing things but no new content
[2:34:12] Eviltuna13: I can see them announce BC hardcore
[2:34:13] daniel85mg: have u heard for Turtle wow? i think C+ may be something liek that
[2:34:18] Theduskflyer: That‚Äôs what‚Äôs metzen is for
[2:34:25] cipusanx: why risk a classic + when classic is just a safe bet
[2:34:27] reaperblade93: Oh damn
[2:34:32] notColt45: It wouldn't be big swath of changes it would be minor small zone maybe every year or something. I'm thinking OSRS small changes
[2:34:36] Wcvechten: like we're going underneath azeroth next on retail too? Kappa

[2:37:00] Niksen_99: Didnt they already try Classic+ with season of mastery tho? it failed

[2:37:53] notColt45: Arenas would be an easy add for classic
[2:37:54] ArcaneSyntax: Hunter spec relegated to profession

[2:43:32] Masteve: I think people miss udnerstand what a vannila + could be, I have one thought experiment for this, Imagine if there was 100's mroe greens and blues while leveling. That alone would hype me to play.
[2:43:42] Bentzer87: I wonder if there will be a new "Fated" raiding
[2:43:45] dracullus: to be honest blizzard should just name all patches 10.X like back in mop, cause now people think DF will have less patches cause no 10.3 xD
[2:44:02] RagingPunk: more epics sure lol

[3:05:08] fewyn: i think hots looks fine
[3:05:11] undisputedmoe: Plater!
[3:05:14] love_eggplant: compare it to other mobas
[3:05:18] GodKingMuninn: But I mean hey, Starcraft x Halo crossover would be the most insane sci-fi game of the century
[3:05:25] jmalmin: They can actually announce 5 expansions at Blizzcon. 3 related to wow.
[3:05:45] Haegemon: compared to other MOBAs that actually retain players, HotS would need a lot more than just some visual updates.

[3:08:10] notColt45: RTS is just too much learning
[3:08:21] Haegemon: to most people, they'd rather get into the "team sport" of a MOBA vs the uber-micro build orders that an RTS required
[3:08:29] ItsNobbie: HotS on Console or something

[3:11:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: i played league of legends for like a week before i uninstalled that toxic shit hole
[3:11:16] Molvonos: They should have never tried to be honest, after they shit the bed with DoTA, which was originally going to be a Blizzard IP until they decided to try and shit on the deal with Icefrog.
[3:11:17] Mister_Ript: HotS was just a weird moba... no items, fully dependent on organized teamplay, etc.
[3:11:19] love_eggplant: add more difficulty
[3:11:21] snake_like: kind of surprising. hots was great casual moba fun.

[4:37:28] DunzoCD: 23rd its gonna be close
[4:37:29] smashwow: yeah it'll be over around 22nd
[4:38:05] smashwow: @DunzoCD idk they killed this raid before reset
[4:38:18] Phoxzy: Considering the logistics of getting a world first raid group together in a location for a race, it would behoove Blizzard to get those guilds a heads up on the date.
[4:38:39] Gooseberries: If this is the last raid of the xpac do you really want it beat in a week?
[4:39:00] mavericks312: If amirdrassil is anything like abberus it‚Äôs over in like 8-9 days and favors liquid
[4:39:03] RolexKT: They absolutely had a heads up
[4:39:06] Phoxzy: It would make sense, but someone would complain about it.
[4:39:11] smashwow: they've probably known for a month because of logistics
[4:39:20] theDirtyon3: yeah they did
[4:39:28] Howitzer1028: As long as blizzcon keeps making money it‚Äôll stay
[4:39:29] theDirtyon3: Max said it pretty much
[4:39:50] smashwow: i swore max said it on a stream that they meet or met about timings
[4:39:56] Phoxzy: Agreed.

[4:57:31] Colt_Engineer: Ah yes I know koriko very well from‚Ä¶certain websites
[4:57:33] Bowwjack: @Towelliee not sure if i want to tank this season or run Unholy DK/Ret Paladin or Aug Evoker.
[4:57:34] Shrenko: where is my 4XL
[4:57:38] NickLeonhearth: since I got back in shape I can wear XL and XXL, which feels amazing
[4:57:42] MackPlays: They should know most players are 3X+
[4:57:48] DrkPhoenix6913: d4 necro zip up hoodie, d4 ugly xmas sweater, pepe xmas ornament, and the horde pillow (need a new couch pillow)
[4:58:00] Eshel: Only 2 3XL - it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt know their audience at all lmao
[4:58:24] MackPlays: Because the fatties can‚Äôt fly

[5:00:23] Mozzeyy_: Huh.. Interesting..
[5:00:27] N3llee: being able to filter through the variations of the game would be a welcome change i think
[5:00:29] GodKingMuninn: I hope april fools day, they rever the launcher to look like the og 2004 one.
[5:00:30] raye_gaming22: they already did that ones so maybe again yea
[5:00:42] Shrenko: dont forget to delete the vod
[5:00:54] DunzoCD: Jebaited
[5:00:57] NickLeonhearth: I believe it will stay under 1 category, they will just update the category image with what's the latest - be it retail or classic etc
[5:01:10] Malarick: Blizz saw the trend of treadmill streams and got rid of 3 & 4XL Sizes
[5:01:41] Eshel: Everyone who logs into the new ‚Äúclassic +‚Äù is shocked to learn that their toons just get transported to retail üòÇüòÇ
[5:01:48] Tooyoo: whatever happend to season of mastery? tehy gave up on that?
[5:01:50] zamoro285: hardcore wont last forever as a category though
[5:02:03] MackPlays: It‚Äôs their fault for having 3 different versions of the same game
[5:02:17] ryanc1124: hardcore is never ending chasing the dragon
[5:02:18] ItsNobbie: WoW Classic Era, WotLK Era, WoW 2nd Edition, WoW Retail
[5:02:29] MILESkg21: its our fault for begging for CLASSIC LuL
[5:02:32] mejiro151: I once looked for a Monk tag in Wow Twitch, turns out, they dont exist
[5:02:44] theDirtyon3: max later on
[5:02:47] Molvonos: @Towelliee I've summoned @Elizare
[5:02:52] xpadeDK: What‚Äôs the point of classic+ though? I honestly can‚Äôt stand classic andies
[5:02:56] Masqerader: ya, but it's also noon here on a monmday
[5:02:59] Masqerader: *monday
[5:03:06] occtriple: Also with other MMOs, like OSRS for example, gets the most views on twitch with people playing HC iron man solo account or group HC iron men
[5:03:13] Molvonos: She's still waking up, but yea

[5:04:22] XshadowturkeyX: oops sorry
[5:04:33] Eshel: Inb4 - classic hardcore + ‚Ä¶. Blizz disables half your buttons
[5:04:34] xpadeDK: I pray blizzard doesn‚Äôt listen to the classic andies and make a wow 2
[5:04:48] Molvonos: @xpadeDK They arent.
[5:04:50] EKS90_: @xpadeDK WoW 2 will never happen.
[5:04:52] SSD511_: i think they bored with the modern wow
[5:05:14] Yagr6: @xpadeDK still holding on to your 20 year old cosmetics

[5:05:16] Odinslayer: dude i can't wait for blizzcon the hype is real
[5:05:20] 91Niki: I feel like right now the category setup benefits blizzard more than the viewer. The viewer has to put in an effort to find which type of wow they want to watch. If they split the game up into different categories, you would not only help viewers find people streaming X version. You would also help smaller streamers being pushed up
[5:05:55] Thoreya: well then tell them to add AP back to retail or give us more shit to do lol
[5:06:01] SSD511_: true
[5:06:13] xpadeDK: @yagr6 there is no point in a wow 2 when the game has been on a progression system based on expansions by expansions
[5:06:14] zysmos: i'm done with hardcore personally
[5:06:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: they were talking about a solo self found mode for hardcore i thought, so that could be interesting
[5:06:21] zysmos: was fun the first few months
[5:06:38] illStefan: i want wow 2 and fuck my 900 mounts need fresh start
[5:06:52] Yagr6: @xpadeDK just face it, most players dont want wow 2 because they know they would lose all achievements and cosmetics
[5:07:03] Masqerader: @illStefan there ain't gonna be a WOW 2
[5:07:17] Molvonos: @Yagr6 Uh, no.  And please don't try to speak for majorities.
[5:07:18] Kosen_: The only chance at a "WoW 2" is an expansion to classic with a new timeline
[5:07:23] MILESkg21: gonna be a long walk back KEKW
[5:07:30] Bowwjack: @Towelliee i think blizzard swerved everyone with the infinite rune stone
[5:07:30] 91Niki: @illStefan Yeah you're gonna have to find an alternate timeline. Wow 2 aint happening LUL
[5:07:36] jeffnsteff2019: so 11.0 end of summer 2024
[5:07:39] EKS90_: WoW 2 will never happen cause  there is no reason for it to happen.
[5:07:44] xpadeDK: @yagr6 and then so? So what if we don‚Äôt want our cosmetics to go away?
[5:07:48] Thoreya: august 11.0
[5:07:48] CaseysOn: we get a way too long s3, and a way too long s4, yay....
[5:07:50] Thoreya: late august
[5:08:10] ramiehunter: @Towelliee  think they are much futher then we expected  in next expansion
[5:08:11] raye_gaming22: so we get fucked my fated again
[5:08:22] mackieeswe: september
[5:08:29] zysmos: Personally i'm not trading a 4th raid for these poor patches we got
[5:08:29] xpadeDK: @yagr6 now let me return the question to u. Why do u want a wow 2?
[5:08:29] Thoreya: if we do get 11.0 next november, that is a 12 month drought which at that point id rather just have a 10.3 lol
[5:08:29] Eshel: Stormbreak in fall 2024 ?
[5:08:33] Nicstar1007: 27 weeks is not too long for a season?
[5:08:34] ILikeKillTheZombies: They should add some allied races as preorder bonus
[5:08:45] DunzoCD: people still thinking theres going to be a WoW 2 KEKW gonna be a harsh reality
[5:08:52] 91Niki: Because people have HARDCORE FOMO
[5:08:54] Masqerader: bring back corruption for s4.. LONG LIVE TD
[5:08:54] mavericks312: We are still getting a fated season that players loved at the end of s-lands
[5:08:55] Snabido: Dont you guys want dinars back? Keepo
[5:08:57] Metket: why hate fated LMAO
[5:09:01] illStefan: question arent we getting less content this exp compared to bfa and legion with the exp costing more ?
[5:09:03] love_eggplant: if we make wow 2 we can make wow 1 classic
[5:09:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: better to get fucked by fated then fucked by yourself
[5:09:10] jeffnsteff2019: no drought
[5:09:13] MILESkg21: pointless seasons cost you a raid tier Kappa
[5:09:15] Thoreya: if theyre only doing 3 raids an expac, id rather have expacs that are not 2 years long
[5:09:21] mavericks312: Bro ppl loved fated in S-lands now they hated wtf
[5:09:21] reaperblade93: Legion soundtrack. Reminds me of Varian
[5:09:22] raye_gaming22: it burned out my guild doing 3 full clears a week with 3 chars
[5:09:23] Odinslayer: but the idea of fated was that they cut tier 4 from shadowlands and they gave us fated, but we should have tier 4 for dragonflight tbh and not a fated season
[5:09:25] reaperblade93: PoroSad
[5:09:31] Molvonos: The idea of MMO (2) is hilarious.  Sony already tried it with Everquest 2, it was a failure through and through.  Last EQ2 expansion was 2017, while EQ1 put out an expansion in 2022.

[5:09:48] WHJustice: we can blame covid for shadowlands
[5:09:56] Thoreya: it is true tho, bfa and legion had much more shit to do
[5:09:56] Gitmm: tbf shadowlands took a lot of anima farming
[5:09:56] EKS90_: @Molvonos it worked with guildwars 2 but it will not work with wow.
[5:09:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: What  maw? LUL
[5:09:58] fewyn: shadow what? that was probably just a dream
[5:09:58] ILikeKillTheZombies: Portal to oribos doesn't exist in my game
[5:10:01] Hu33ard: i loved shadowlands, was better than df so far
[5:10:03] jeffnsteff2019: because asmon rated it higher then DF
[5:10:10] Molvonos: @Yagr6 That's your opinion, and wrong, but hey, you do you.  You're a wonderfully negative person.
[5:10:11] Gitmm: this expac nothing to farm
[5:10:21] Eshel: We‚Äôre only a couple years away from Draenor nostalgia and people saying they miss it
[5:10:24] CardinalTX: Wow players are fucking crazy.  Lmao
[5:10:27] zysmos: I'd rather have the BFA way rather than what they're doing now
[5:10:30] mavericks312: @yagr6 no way you just said WoW graphics is outdated
[5:10:36] love_eggplant: i work at blizzard
[5:10:39] brewgamingtv: they never even said anything about having 4 raids lol
[5:10:40] love_eggplant: as cleaning lady
[5:10:41] DunzoCD: @Molvonos it worked with GW 2 because they changed so much fundamentally with the game
[5:10:41] 91Niki: @Yagr6 Find another game to play. There I solved the issue for you SeemsGood
[5:10:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: pulled from their ass
[5:10:47] Snabido: Prolly the wod ptsd
[5:10:51] Molvonos: @EKS90_ Yea, I think  that was the only case.  But, they basically stopped supporting Guild Wars for GW2 in that case, while Everquest tried supporting both.
[5:10:53] Thoreya: id rather bfa style content than this imo idk
[5:10:53] denflup: i bet it was cut content, but it was cut before even DF was announced.
[5:10:57] Gooseberries: Because Fyrakk as an end boss for the xpac is a huge L
[5:10:57] Masqerader: their friend of a friend works at Blizzard
[5:10:58] xziyn: Do you think it's possible we get the new expansion before summer? Assuming same alpha/beta cycle as DF?
[5:10:59] Thoreya: content cadence*
[5:11:02] MILESkg21: what was the last expac that ended at X.2.5 ??
[5:11:03] CaseysOn: their patch cadence should be 18 months then, not 24
[5:11:10] Bowwjack: @Towelliee we don't even know if this is actually the end of the expansion either
[5:11:10] mavericks312: WoWs have aged so beautifly compared to other mmos
[5:11:16] Thoreya: ^
[5:11:17] Molvonos: @Yagr6 Homie, I ain't mad.  I'm pointing out facts, you're pointing out biased opinions.  Huge difference.
[5:11:17] Orczeus: people love drama
[5:11:20] illStefan: but is it fair to say we got less content in DF and SL compared to BFA and Legion ?
[5:11:22] Metket: @Gooseberries who you want to fight? sylvanas? LUL
[5:11:25] GodKingMuninn: people bitch about the new patch cadence, but conveinetly leave out how they got angry at long expansions with droughts. Buncha fuckwits lol
[5:11:27] EKS90_: @Molvonos @DunzoCD yes I agree with you both for sure.
[5:11:29] Thoreya: 24 months for 3 raids is a bit wack honestly
[5:11:34] xpadeDK: @yagr6 I think u are confusing graphics with art style, and even with graphics being outdated for old zones, a world revamp would be enough. No need for a wow 2 and get rid of everyone‚Äôs time and effort for the years of playing wow
[5:11:35] mavericks312: @xziyn no what makes you think the xpac is dropping before the summer?
[5:11:40] Odinslayer: so 10.2 for a whole year until next expansion? no way man
[5:11:43] dokor: imagine, blizzard planing ahead
[5:11:45] 91Niki: @Yagr6 So you are playing a game you dislike and shitting on it just to shit on it?
[5:12:06] mavericks312: @odinslayer we are getting a fated season
[5:12:11] Molvonos: @Yagr6 Did I say that?  You keep on and you're gonna get sat out.  I said your opinion is wrong, not that you cant have one.  Again, huge difference.
[5:12:14] MinivannGaming: "My  father's, brother's, nephew's, cousin's, former roommate who works with a guy who saw Blizzard from the highway told me..." - Dark Helmet
[5:12:17] reaperblade93: Makes sense
[5:12:18] Thoreya: man i hope we get an august/sept expac
[5:12:21] Thoreya: and not novemeber
[5:12:23] xpadeDK: @yagr6 and dun even come and tell me that there is no new players playing retail wow, I‚Äôm a new player who started in shadowlands, and I‚Äôm enjoying the game right now.
[5:12:23] Eshel: @91niki  - that could apply to a lot of the players unfortunately
[5:12:24] CaseysOn: its NOT content its test.
[5:12:30] mavericks312: Bro when did the mmo champ peeps come to chat lol
[5:12:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: I got snubbed on the beta last time

[5:12:45] zelours: Classic + will entertain us Kappa
[5:12:52] Odinslayer: yes but a fated season is not a "new tier" its just old dungeons/raids same as shadowlands so its basically 10.2 or 10.2.7 if you want to put a number on it lol
[5:13:05] MILESkg21: Classic + will give us Raggy + with legs Kappa
[5:13:08] 91Niki: @Eshel Like I really don't get it. If you have such a huge problem with a game, quit. There is SOOOO many more options out there LUL
[5:13:14] jeffnsteff2019: wasnt beta for DF heavly plsyer feedback and is why DF was highly liked
[5:13:21] MinivannGaming: I always play Alpha/Beta - Only thing I don't do are dungeons or raids - I save those for live

[5:13:45] zysmos: Not looking forward to get back in VOTI ResidentSleeper
[5:13:47] mavericks312: @odinslayer it‚Äôs a chance to get powerful gear and just crush shit mindlessly. And guess what players loved it in s-lands why is it a problem jow
[5:13:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's a real season
[5:13:53] Eshel: @91niki  I agree - I tell them all the time ‚Äúspeak with your pocketbook if you want them to listen‚Äù lmao
[5:13:59] reaperblade93: Holidays
[5:14:15] EKS90_: I would prefer 10.3 and then fated as a smaller end but Im happy with content overall.
[5:14:29] Mecabeast: Being able to mix tier sets in 10.3 will be dope
[5:14:30] ramiehunter: @Towelliee  you here reminding me HFC time forever season
[5:14:44] MILESkg21: in 19 years its never happened
[5:14:50] castiegaming: wonder if the new ff14 xpac comes out first or not
[5:14:51] mavericks312: There is no way these same ppl bitching actually play the game
[5:14:53] Eshel: ‚ÄúGo fuck off‚Äù - I vote for that as new xpac name !!  LOL
[5:14:53] Rudric_Ice: wow retail has been played out too much now it got bland its time for classic + to become a thing !!!!
[5:14:55] xpadeDK: @towelliee why are u being so real, I love u so much üòò
[5:14:57] Odinslayer: @mavericks312 cause in shadowlands we had covid and that was an excuse for making new shit lol, now they have no excuse to give us new things, and they do have the man power they have 700+ devs lol
[5:15:00] koko316: towLfg
[5:15:00] Lazugo: PREACH
[5:15:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: its my content and i want it now
[5:15:04] 91Niki: @Eshel Even then, sometimes you just gotta accept a game is going in a direction that isn't for you. Doesn't mean the game is bad, just mean it isn't for you anymore. Nothing wrong with that. People need to stop clinging on for dear life to a game like it is spinning around them
[5:15:08] Masqerader: Hell Shadowlands story was about a drought and we farmed endlessly
[5:15:10] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Retail for retail?  How weird.
[5:15:13] Sir_Kalabad: Fuckin Dylan up in here
[5:15:14] Haegemon: MMOs breed content locusts, it is impossible for any studio/devs to create meaningful, new content at a faster pace than the player base will fully consume every last bit of it.
[5:15:14] N3llee: I'm happy about the Microsoft Office bundle with WoW sub.
[5:15:15] Metket: @Towelliee i thought those people didn't play BFA at all, literally 1.5 years of no content LUL
[5:15:19] ThorH13: We need a drought so we don't have another incident like vanilla Nax40
[5:15:20] ashwing_: @Rudric_Ice Hot takes guy is back KEKW
[5:15:21] mavericks312: @odinslayer and they clearly said that‚Äôs the patch cadence they are using going forward
[5:15:29] dragothicx: Was the last season of Shadowlands successful with the Fated raids? They'll do it again for DF raids in it's last season? could be cool for people who might have missed the raids
[5:15:33] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos how is that RETAIL bro
[5:15:33] AvrithSATX: Player entitlement is amazing. Day X: New content release, Day Y: Players asking "but what did you give me TODAY?"
[5:15:46] zysmos: 4
[5:15:46] CMack_72: 17
[5:15:52] zysmos: oh
[5:15:55] Bowwjack: @Towelliee like 2 at max
[5:15:58] PvtHudson093: up to 8.35
[5:16:00] CaseysOn: More than SL and BFA
[5:16:01] zysmos: I don't know about that
[5:16:05] Thoreya: bfa was litty
[5:16:08] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Classic is Classic.  The moment you add content that wasn't part of Classic, it no longer can be classified as Classic.  It's retail.  You're paying for extra content rather than your rehashed nostalgia.

[5:16:20] tempistrane: Blizzard is a small indy company. We need to give them grace. =P
[5:16:25] Lazugo: 0.0,0.1, 0.2, 0.3
[5:16:26] Odinslayer: @mavericks312 they said they will only have a .2 every expansion from now on? have a proof for that?
[5:16:30] mavericks312: @rudric_ice the moment you add something new to classic it‚Äôs retail

[5:17:24] Tooyoo: @Towelliee Masqeradar's linkk has it
[5:17:24] Eshel: Arm ourselves and have a WoW Civil War - it‚Äôs the only logical answer lmao
[5:17:26] Thoreya: and click expand
[5:17:39] zelours: Dude spider man 2 reviews 10/10 across the bored! Hype
[5:17:41] Mecabeast: 8.1 was like February 2019 with 8.1.5 in like march
[5:17:44] Moobot: Calm the spam, @arcantio123 (warning)
[5:17:44] mavericks312: @caseyson only 3 major raids
[5:17:50] Masqerader: expand
[5:17:50] Thoreya: click
[5:17:51] Thoreya: expand
[5:17:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: enhance
[5:18:03] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos thats why its called classic + and not retail im not saying to change the whole classic gameplay to retail minor changes is fine like buffing some classes and adding new content which was never added into vanilla
[5:18:22] Z3ROR: WoWpedia has moved to Warcraft Wiki since a few days ago.
[5:18:37] EKS90_: @Rudric_Ice it would be like OSRS, its not like adding content to OSRS makes it runescape 3.

[5:18:49] Masqerader: almost as many cats I have had named patches
[5:18:51] CaseysOn: :D
[5:18:53] MILESkg21: hotfixes dont count
[5:19:02] ashwing_: @Rudric_Ice Will never happen
[5:19:05] mavericks312: 11 patches of content and ppl bitching about content
[5:19:11] veryhairyheyyall: towIgnit

[5:19:28] zysmos: To be fair I think these .5 .7 have been pretty boring content
[5:19:30] ashwing_: @mavericks312 Nah they cry about more raids so they can go do LFR LUL
[5:19:31] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice It's still retail.  Adding that little plus doesnt change anything about that. Classic was a #nochanges thing for a reason.
[5:19:42] mavericks312: 10.1.7 dropped dream surges which is new content
[5:19:43] herzlustafir: towShy
[5:19:45] Odinslayer: is it a good thing to have an expansion every  18 months?

[5:20:42] ashwing_: People literally wanted no grind in the game and now yall saying why no grind KEKW
[5:20:45] IgoR_25: Do you think next expansion will follow Dragonflight steps patch-wise?
[5:20:58] White7fang: towelliee know what he talking about . just stop trying to argue whit the man
[5:20:58] 91Niki: Wow players: there isn't enough to do! the game is boring!!! --- also wow players; there is too much shit to do, wtf do you think i dont have a life outside of wow or something???? towRee
[5:21:04] mavericks312: @gitmm grinds in games are dead in todays gaming space
[5:21:07] gajitron: Blizzard has announced that Patch 10.2 launches on November 7th! niceeeeeeeeee
[5:21:12] Ballswagger: jesus legion was 6 years ago?

[5:21:41] MILESkg21: pmsLUL  awkwardly true
[5:21:50] popzagon: Bring back single boss raids
[5:21:56] tirraldra: As someone who took a break from the game - I love that there is so much to do in the game. And honestly, as I've been progressing in the game, I love the lore. It feels more... lorey.... vs the past 2 expansions.
[5:22:00] mavericks312: Ppl who don‚Äôt actually play the game are making it known right now lol
[5:22:09] Havoc_S1: Havoc_S1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[5:22:11] EKS90_: @Quecklain So you are just speaking out of your ass, good to know. not gonna engage further.
[5:22:23] ashwing_: @popzagon And what will this achieve exactly LUL
[5:22:23] crymeog: customer retention
[5:22:32] 91Niki: People need to remember that it's gonna be the non casual players who are gonna be vocal when there is something they don't agree with. The casual players are having fun playing right now
[5:22:32] herzlustafir: most fun i had for a long time in DF

[5:22:39] Quecklain: @EKS90_ How so? I personally just enjoy mythic raiding. whats wrong with that?
[5:22:40] MinivannGaming: WoW players just wont be happy with whatever the current situation is - if you give them exactly what they want it still wont be good enough
[5:22:51] Carahail: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-season-3-launches-on-november-14th-amirdrassil-raid-mythic-rotation-335529
[5:22:52] mavericks312: Also sub rentention alone with DF proves a lot of these take‚Äôs wrong
[5:22:55] dwolters_the_zombieman: you can't please everyone they all find something to bitch about
[5:22:57] popzagon: @ashwing_ Theyre fun little content in between big patches
[5:22:58] Secondbreakfasttt: i'd rather 1 more raid in any day tho fated season was fun
[5:23:03] zysmos: I mean that seems to work for them
[5:23:03] Eshel: My summary: a couple weeks ago I felt like I was running out of stuff to do - last week I started working on old achievements and now I‚Äôm almost overwhelmed by stuff to do
[5:23:05] Masqerader: they will comeback complaining they can't skip something
[5:23:10] Folgrum: also trading post added. some content too
[5:23:17] Snabido: KEKW
[5:23:23] fluh_: LuL
[5:23:24] MILESkg21: KEKW  holy
[5:23:30] Syllvn: I much prefer the mini patches and smaller content drops in between, keeps things moving.
[5:23:40] mavericks312: Also the biggest content addition was the trading post which is amazing
[5:23:40] ashwing_: @popzagon Literally pointless taking resourses to create mechanics etc
[5:23:46] Masqerader: they can rotate incorporeal and afflicted out
[5:23:53] EKS90_: @Quecklain you said "every week is a patch then" when towelliee is talking about content drops, not every week drops content. that is just a wrong statement then.  DF has had more content han any expansion, if you only like 1 piece of content, that is fine, but people stating no content, are wrong.
[5:24:02] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos as you said Classic was a #nochanges thing thats why its called classic + so kinda contradicting your own point
[5:24:08] MILESkg21: its possible
[5:24:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Angry druids!
[5:24:15] Eshel: I‚Äôve said it before and will say it again - ‚Äúsome people would bitch if their ice cream was cold‚Äù
[5:24:24] Quecklain: @EKS90_ I was just refering to him when he said "hotfixes are a patch"
[5:24:28] Snabido: Not reworked since 2013? üëÄ
[5:24:30] Orczeus: im happy
[5:24:32] Orczeus: unholy here
[5:24:33] 91Niki: Yeaaah, it being a druid focused patch that has a leggo druids can't use is a liiiiiittle weird. But personally I am more hyped about the new cat forms LUL
[5:24:35] Aro725: Frost and UH have been the same since legion
[5:24:35] mejiro151: Blood DK set is also bumpin
[5:24:40] fewyn: because dks are still slow
[5:24:40] Aro725: its not fun, just a bandaid
[5:24:40] Ralandis: You're gonna explain it until you're blue in the face, but the sweaty gamers don't give a shit. They wanna complain to complain, but still sit and play a game they shit on because they actually have no original thought to do anything new. This topic is literally as old as WoW itself and is so tired LUL
[5:24:43] MILESkg21: UH is the most broken spec there is KEKW
[5:24:45] reaperblade93: Yeah idk how LUL
[5:24:50] Mozzeyy_: Legendary doesnt help if u dont get it Sadge
[5:24:51] mavericks312: @aro725 but there still crazy cracked
[5:24:52] GodKingMuninn: Frost DK is still sad. Most of our issues aren't being adressed
[5:24:58] reaperblade93: Yeah but they are op why change?
[5:25:04] dwolters_the_zombieman: the only reason i'm not playing wow is i can't subscribe right now
[5:25:10] EKS90_: @Quecklain 10.1.7 is not a hotfix tho, people said in chat hotfixes doesn't count, but they forget thet .7 dropped dreamsurges, campaign quests etc, it was just a "hotfix"
[5:25:20] Thoreya: WW just gave up
[5:25:22] reaperblade93: LUL LUL LUL
[5:25:23] Aro725: @mavericks312 That has nothing to do with being fun to play
[5:25:24] Thoreya: they dont speak anymore
[5:25:25] reaperblade93: True
[5:25:28] Metket: Resto Shaman Sadge
[5:25:33] 91Niki: @Thoreya What??? WW is pumping in dungeons!
[5:25:39] raye_gaming22: to be fair MM hunter is dogshit  it does tank dmg on ptr
[5:25:39] Orczeus: unholy had spec issues last raid with AOE being talents messed up
[5:25:41] DunzoCD: @Thoreya they all rerolled KEKW
[5:25:42] Elizare: Wait why are the rogues pissed off? So I can be properly outraged as a rogue player
[5:25:42] occtriple: Wait it‚Äôs random who gets the legendary in 10.2? @towelliee
[5:25:43] odriscoll1234: poor ww monks
[5:25:43] Orczeus: but other than that its been ok
[5:25:46] CaseysOn: at least thanksgiving is only a US holiday, clear EU bias detected
[5:25:55] 91Niki: NotLikeThis
[5:25:56] Thoreya: @91Niki are they? lol i just heard their playstyle sucks
[5:26:00] MILESkg21: class fantasy KEKW
[5:26:06] EKS90_: havent found it, been looking tho
[5:26:09] Tooyoo: probably hiding legendary until after mythic last boss dies.
[5:26:12] 91Niki: @Thoreya I am LOVING IT! actually having more fun on my ww monk than my feral druid atm!
[5:26:16] Eshel: @elizare  Any rogue mad now is just nitpicking imo
[5:26:21] PvtHudson093: nope
[5:26:40] Secondbreakfasttt: assuming this will be the last tier they gave us just 1 new dungeon in all expansion sadge
[5:26:42] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice My guy, I didn't contradict anything.  The 'changes' they made were small enough to remain 'Classic'.  You add brand new content that retail players didn't get, makes it decidedly -Not- Classic.
[5:26:54] tempistrane: So Asmondgold?
[5:26:54] Karbonn: That dude is goingto play WoW till he dies
[5:27:00] Eshel: Fucking boomers
[5:27:01] Tooyoo: addiction sadge
[5:27:01] Drizz_36: addiction, that's why
[5:27:02] MILESkg21: nobody is holding a gun to his head LuL
[5:27:06] Eshel: *doomers
[5:27:07] trivotix: The people that complain on the forums houses look like Asmongolds house...
[5:27:07] mavericks312: @secondbreakfasttt bro they haven‚Äôt given us multiple new dungeons in awhile
[5:27:14] itjustfeelsright: i think people just enjoy shitting on games
[5:27:19] DunzoCD: @Thoreya do you still have to play faeline stomp? i loved playing ww but never liked you had to use that ability
[5:27:20] ryanc1124: for some reason people cant just find a way to have fun on wow unless its rushing end game shit
[5:27:22] Drizz_36: and he still talks about wow all the time anyway LULW
[5:27:23] heydjsz: im on the struggle bus finding a mmo to invest in
[5:27:27] N3llee: So Nov 7th what does that translate for Blizzcon and RWF?
[5:27:31] Masqerader: they probably don't even do content anyway
[5:27:34] arcantio123: 100% asmon did it right
[5:27:38] zeitgeiz: What game keeps the same gear forever?
[5:27:47] Metket: @N3llee wdym?
[5:27:48] Snabido: Their copium a whole different level
[5:27:48] 91Niki: @DunzoCD Uhhhhhh, i think you use it for purely single target? But I am playing cleave build for dungeons :)
[5:27:49] Eshel: Is there a ‚Äúwow sucks.com‚Äù? - could make a fortune lol
[5:27:52] rymerre: @zeitgeiz ESO and GW2
[5:27:55] GodKingMuninn: Took him forever to realize we didn't watch him for gameplay.
[5:28:13] N3llee: o wow okay so think RWF peeps skip Blizzcon in person?
[5:28:13] reaperblade93: Gear makes the game more interesting, I don‚Äôt wanna have the same gear since legion
[5:28:19] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos Hence the name "CLASSIC +"
[5:28:20] Mecabeast: #liquidsavesthankgiving
[5:28:22] Wcvechten: Wait, where do I go to burn my eyes out? I'm down for one
[5:28:25] AlphasaurusRexx: @zeitgeiz i think NW for the most part too?
[5:28:29] ashwing_: @rymerre That sounds boring af
[5:28:32] 3PO_SitHappen: some people some time WOW
[5:28:46] mavericks312: @rudric_ice yea true but the minute you add brand new content it‚Äôs retail
[5:28:47] N3llee: last i saw tickets werent sold out. First time I recall seeing that ever
[5:28:52] Nerendis: Is mic cutting for anyone else?
[5:28:56] Eshel: Reddit is painful for most things though - if I see one more ‚ÄúI got banned for no reason‚Äù post ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
[5:29:02] WHJustice: wowcirclejerk mostly makes fun of the main wow reddit
[5:29:03] 91Niki: @DunzoCD Yeah only purely single target build uses the stomp. So you won't run that in dungeons. I use the cleave build in dungeons. It uses none of the shadowlands abilities
[5:29:12] mavericks312: Vanilla gearing was trash I‚Äôm just gonna say it
[5:29:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @Rudric_Ice dude name a game where adding the "+" at the end adds new shit to the game. its almost always just harder versions of the same content
[5:29:13] N3llee: nope
[5:29:15] trivotix: nope
[5:29:15] Shrenko: no
[5:29:16] Metket: no

[5:29:18] herzlustafir: wtf is wrong with all these fucking nej sayers... enjoy something in your mother fucking life. go get some pussy jesus christ
[5:29:18] Sylphy_TV: nope
[5:29:18] Wcvechten: a weapon... like it's an artifact or something? Call it weapon artifacts Kappa
[5:29:20] GodKingMuninn: The other thing people don't ever mention about reusing old dungeon content is. You'll get more mogs per expansion than before
[5:29:20] reaperblade93: Not for me
[5:29:20] Lazugo: I liked for artificat weapons
[5:29:20] Submarine_Mike: nope
[5:29:22] Gitmm: ring from first raid still going to be used  in t3

[5:29:24] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice It's not classic plus, it's retail.  Again, ad Infinium.  It's heavy copium to believe anything else.
[5:29:27] Eshel: No mic trouble here
[5:29:28] Nerendis: Must be my end then
[5:29:29] Lazugo: but after that who cares
[5:29:35] aretho47: when something rare drops its fun to have it for a while
[5:29:42] Masqerader: when you make a macro each time your grief torch resets, it's a good time
[5:29:48] fluh_: oh me too
[5:29:51] DunzoCD: @91Niki nice! i may give mine a shot this season then :)
[5:29:51] Nerendis: I loved artifact weapons
[5:29:57] Bowwjack: @Towelliee Darkmoon Card: Greatness ret paladins had that shit for the entire expansion of wrath until ICC
[5:30:05] CardinalTX: Want the same gear forever? Go play ESO.
[5:30:12] Lazugo: they're still good for some people
[5:30:18] Lazugo: thats the most bizarre
[5:30:23] Wcvechten: at mythic some are still near bis I believe for some
[5:30:24] Drizz_36: if blizzard kept artifact weapons 3 expansions after legion people would be complaining about them recycling old content and having no new ideas
[5:30:26] Masqerader: earnog
[5:30:32] EKS90_: ESO and GW2 has vertical progression with same gear for years, go play that.
[5:30:33] aretho47: @CardinalTX not forever, just longer than what it is now
[5:30:37] EKS90_: horizontal*

[5:31:19] Zirist: Nada
[5:31:21] CaseysOn: aura buffs
[5:31:22] odriscoll1234: nothing
[5:31:23] Masqerader: fodder was removed
[5:31:39] MILESkg21: u dont Kappa
[5:31:41] CaseysOn: they gave everything else buffs to compensate
[5:31:44] Wcvechten: give demon hunters a glock to compensate
[5:31:45] 91Niki: Fun was detected, fun was removed
[5:31:48] CaseysOn: VDH, Havoc are HUGE dam
[5:32:09] geokouts: no fun allowed near end of expantion :P
[5:32:11] Masqerader: foodder =  let's lose 50% movement speed to find a stupid ass demon and get killed trying to burst

[5:43:18] Nerendis: I frankly won't play rumble on my phone.
[5:43:32] Lintgamer: You cant play Warcraft rumble in all counties. Hearstone can be played everywhere
[5:43:37] valianya: Its still the top card battling game tho, isn't it?

[5:52:57] BlueBlurPrime: lula getting the early leaks

[6:09:10] N3llee: Admittedly I'm a huge Diablo fan. D1 and 2 holds a special place for me so maybe I am jaded about it.  As for D4 I have 0 interested to grind the same Dungeons over and over with any ability to modify or change how I play that experience.
[6:09:12] Elderpug27: i love that
[6:09:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: the preload was available last friday so im sure they extracted it from there
