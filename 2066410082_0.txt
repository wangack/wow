[0:05:53] simplyhebi: morning gamer
[0:06:05] simplyhebi: do you like tree in here just for the last boss?
[0:06:20] jenkinsdonuttv: Good morning mister JB
[0:06:22] simplyhebi: ive thought about running it people were dropping to swarms in my 29 left and right
[0:10:24] Schubie74: !mdi
[0:11:45] elzweipe: because they got a second phase with less dmg wich takes a lot of time
[0:17:45] Hred5: holy shit nice dmg
[0:23:45] Dhima: Dhima subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 25 month streak! GG bb
[0:25:00] rallevapex: what thing do u cheese with meld?
[0:31:35] SixOneZil: That, @rallevapex , the volley. They taunt + meld twice so the boss restarts the cast twice. By the time he's finishing the cast for the third time they have the health buff and first volley requires less defensives
[0:31:58] SixOneZil: also, hello gang, hello jdotb :)
[0:32:22] Simkha: Morning (if it is in fact morning)
[0:33:47] Dhima: damn 30 BRH nice

[0:35:53] IAmSolari: oblivion is weird with paying people I'd message someone
[0:36:46] IAmSolari: big druid things
[0:37:07] SixOneZil: @jdotb im curious about other healers (i play disc). How do other healers handle one-shot mechanics without frequent DR/shields ? Like volley here  or lady nazjar, etc. I'm talking 27-29 range. Is it just relying more on personal cooldowns from everyone?
[0:37:22] SixOneZil: its super vague and random question haha
[0:37:49] SixOneZil: fair enough
[0:37:57] SixOneZil: cause im burning through painsupps and i find it hard already
[0:38:41] caradea_: people need to check for themselves how they can live, but it's hard in pugs
[0:38:42] IAmSolari: are you playing on EU?

[1:29:36] Sleepypan: i have an AD key i gotta do
[1:29:56] GigaToons: Hi JB! Can I gain your honest opinion - if MDI keys can be completed without a healer - they're too low? No challenge? Thoughts?
[1:30:16] Sleepypan: how the fuck r my EU keys on tyran better than fort
[1:30:40] Elyptico: is echo gonna make the comeback today?
[1:30:58] Sleepypan: but if MDI keys are higher its not the same kinda speed run comp
[1:31:21] Sleepypan: tho idk i feel they cud do like 25s at least speed run?
[1:31:26] Sleepypan: idk ?
[1:31:38] Whitewolf1441: @Sleepypan yeah ive been wondering why the keys  are kinda low
[1:31:43] Nico_vdM: Aint the first few rounds lower than finals?
[1:31:47] Elyptico: @GigaToons those comps still have tons of heals and dont pull as big of packs
[1:31:49] Sleepypan: they get higher in the finas
[1:31:51] Elyptico: its all a trade off
[1:31:54] Sleepypan: yeh @Nico_vdM
[1:32:19] Sleepypan: there should be a comp but u gotta pug KEKW

[1:34:25] Sleepypan: right
[1:34:27] Sleepypan: F
[1:35:23] Sleepypan: THIS BOSS ON 30 SOUNDS FUCKING TERRIFYING
[1:35:58] ren0m: Chat, if I craft with an enchanted crest, there's still a chance the item won't be 484 iLvL, right? It's basically a gamble.
[1:36:14] Sleepypan: THINK SO
[1:36:22] Nico_vdM: It depends on the crafter's skill etc
[1:36:28] mTwSunde: rank 4 grants you 482 no ?
[1:36:31] Nico_vdM: I think the max they can guarantee is 4
[1:36:51] ren0m: 4 what?
[1:37:00] Nico_vdM: rank 4 / 5
[1:37:06] Sleepypan: tyran bosses sleepy24Zzz
[1:37:37] ren0m: I have Enchanted Aspect's Dreaming Crest, so it should give 473-486
[1:37:48] Sleepypan: man i miss the shakib and jb days
[1:37:57] ren0m: Now if I understand correctly a skilled crafter has a higher chance to proc 486
[1:38:05] Sleepypan: @ren0m yes
[1:38:35] ren0m: If, for example, I get 484, can I get it up to 486?
[1:38:38] Sleepypan: any crafters in the chat on twisting nether?
[1:38:44] ren0m: Or is it the normal uprade path with crests
[1:39:02] Sleepypan: no u have to proc it with the crafter @ren0m
[1:39:09] Nico_vdM: You can do recrafts it will just require the base mats again - not the crest
[1:39:15] Sleepypan: ^
[1:39:31] ren0m: Ahh ok, thank you very much.

[5:04:29] devilhawk83: Dawgs is looking good as I think they could get to the finals
[5:04:39] fremen14: meeres died a lot yesterday but thats just class diff without a healer no? cant really die on mage and ret
[5:05:44] Kyocere: ech doing just enough dmg that sunguine didnt heal up? just ticked down slow
[5:06:14] Milano___: Sanguine?
[5:06:46] EmElw: ethical dps
[5:07:00] EmElw: not an ounce of pad cleave
[5:07:03] kregertv: @jdotb echo messed up with the sang pool though to throw it
[5:07:06] 9hoowl: w/o the sanguine healing
[5:07:13] 9hoowl: 44mil
[5:07:15] 9hoowl: is a lot ye

[5:07:30] Fantala: sjele vs clickz, sjele won that by 500k dps
[5:07:38] Whitewolf1441: @Suggoll wait wdym
[5:07:43] 9hoowl: @ffantala evoker
[5:07:48] 9hoowl: vs no evoke
[5:08:00] 9hoowl: but sjele is better i think
[5:08:03] Suggoll: @Suggoll I've just seen it do huge dam on that fight, no clue why
[5:08:03] Schmaddox: its the aug diff there in the dmg phase
[5:08:22] FinestGoldy: and echo seemed to just stall in comparison
[5:09:14] ren0m: If I craft a neck without embellishments, can I add them later?
[5:09:16] Schmaddox: aug double dips there in the dmg buff i think
[5:10:07] turboer: @ren0m yes recrafting you can pop it in, even change embellishments
[5:10:10] sw0ngs: well their second fall they did, if meeres didnt die, it woulda been faster than the comp with the healer xD
[5:10:19] ren0m: @turboer Thank you
[5:11:04] Zircons: dawgs are built different when they're actually playing well
[5:11:07] Velounian: Playing with a healer allows you to focus prio ST?
[5:11:26] minimozza_: are you watching the run from yesterday?
[5:11:45] 9hoowl: tbh its so fkn boring to look at 4 dps
[5:11:47] turboer: just lost globals to self-heal etc maybe
[5:12:11] Surarn: Was their boss dmg higher though?

[5:15:20] JackBurton176: @jdotb  or giving up good dps talents for defensive talents
[5:15:24] sw0ngs: maybe echo ran 4 dps and lost on purpose to prove that 4 dps comp is shit. But ended up fucking the everbloom run lol

[6:16:14] Whitewolf1441: @pseudorand_ lmao
[6:16:16] Surarn: Lust as soon as Danta spawns gives you a full lust on boss i think
[6:16:23] Surarn: not with dps increase but he doesnt go away at least
[6:16:40] witu_gg: Isn't it stolen by nick cage
[6:17:06] EmElw: north korea probably
[6:17:09] Noyus_: mostly asian
[6:17:21] Kawfee303: Many countries push patriotic things

[6:17:29] sharkafina: back in the communist days ye but not now
[6:17:31] Funkytree: we maye did it once in the entire education, lika a one off event
[6:17:31] bollplankk: tipping is retarded
[6:17:38] Surarn: Our grandparents probably did
[6:17:51] bollplankk: what kind of fucking business doesn't take labor costs into their equation
[6:17:51] SAMBBA1: No.
[6:17:56] Notfuton: jdotbJAMMY jdotbJAMMY jdotbJAMMY
[6:17:58] Hayotal: Tipping is a US thing
[6:17:59] yipzen: Probably in North Korea

[6:18:32] Kemplore: If you are not from USA and you get USA money you should say the USA pledge.
[6:18:33] fundersaam: Are you not playing in the MDI mr jb?
[6:18:33] Noyus_: tipping actually just employer outsourcing his payment to his employees
[6:18:36] truthlol: i bet rise has cool tech
[6:18:44] chaigy: @Kemplore what is that, braindead take
[6:18:52] stabbypoo: stabbypoo subscribed at Tier 1.

[6:24:07] flawlesslykun: KEKW 󠀀
[6:24:09] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[6:24:16] chaigy: hi flawless jdotbHypers
[6:24:27] flawlesslykun: FeelsOkayMan ayo
[6:24:58] Kyocere: teams should only get 1 ban total. would make them do harder keys
[6:25:31] chaigy: wait did i do the right teams
[6:25:58] Drohgoh: @Scikey in this comp. everyone is unkillable. and having lifebloom on self+ priest is best. and having a perma c ward on 1 player spot healing is more valuable than aoe healing in these.
[6:26:15] chaigy: I DID IT WRONG
[6:26:16] chaigy: BRUH
[6:26:39] Scikey: @Drohgoh thanks for the reasoning!
[6:27:20] chaigy: yea Drohgoh do you have any info why Drohgoh takes Infusion
[6:27:30] TBouse: extending cen ward multiple times in a row so you never have to heal the tank Pog
[6:27:43] fremen14: how many teams make it to globals? 4?
[6:28:14] Whitewolf1441: imagine verdent infusion with cenarion ward @jdotb
[6:30:11] REGENAROCKET: Poor drohgo highlight real lol
[6:31:26] Zircons: James the spider
[6:31:55] TBouse: playing verdant depends on the dungeon, it's definitely not the play in this key for example
[6:32:15] Scikey: velo took overgrowth instead of taking cen ward? that's a rare one too
[6:33:29] frazlord: If echo loses here are they fully out?
[6:33:32] stefanssson30952: is echo going to grand finals?
[6:33:46] kelly_mac06: @frazlord yes
[6:33:54] Whitewolf1441: @stefanssson30952 if they win this yes

[6:41:45] Whitewolf1441: hahah jb
[6:41:46] arcanitejr: Why is your youtube livestream showing you doing keys? Like is it a past livestream?
[6:41:47] nash25pl: this is the cooking we wanted  !
[6:41:59] nash25pl: Bananacatrun
[6:42:02] shortsniperxbt: GAMERS
[6:42:44] Kyocere: as they should celebrate, rp has no place in timed runs
[6:43:00] JackBurton176: did anyone clip that portal shortcut
[6:43:03] Noyus_: holyyy tbh
[6:43:34] pnavara: the power or kilometers
[6:44:08] JackBurton176: did anyone clip the portal shortcut?
[6:44:24] Whitewolf1441: @JackBurton176 im sure on the main stream

[6:44:41] nash25pl: KEKL
[6:44:57] sybtje: who is in voice with him?
[6:45:01] TBouse: ah yes of course Max saw it all coming Kappa
[6:45:02] twinkieruler95: @jdotb explain how they did that im confused
[6:45:42] Fullclang: how did they summon the person to the platform while in combat with riftmage?
[6:46:02] pnavara: but how teleport in combat
[6:46:05] Whitewolf1441: @Fullclang thats what im wondering , im assuming you can accept a summon even in combat?
[6:46:11] fromthecrypt55: but does that mean you have to play nefls and have a lolck?
[6:46:15] nash25pl: meld ?
[6:46:16] sybtje: with who are you in voice with @jdotb ?
[6:48:17] kelly_mac06: I am super curious as to the mechanics of what they just did
[6:48:18] Whitewolf1441: @sybtje growl and max and someone else
[6:48:20] AGuyWithPants: finally a heart of wild gamer
[6:48:22] kelly_mac06: that was fantastic
[6:48:28] kelly_mac06: @sybtje JPC

[6:48:35] Surarn: I guess meld but he had hots
[6:48:37] Surarn: and then naowh meld
[6:48:37] JackBurton176: @jdotb its likely the same way that they hack the raids to get your lust back
[6:48:45] Noyus_: possibly naowh walking into efflo after zaelia dropped combat?
[6:48:49] caradea_: wrath?
[6:49:27] WoozlesTV: @jdotb can you md add?
[6:50:15] TBouse: pretty hilarious even in 5x slo mo replay it's hard to figure out
[6:50:56] nash25pl: just w8 and ask them after i guess if they willing to share
[6:50:58] kelly_mac06: LIES
[6:51:01] nash25pl: otherwise is just guessing
[6:51:08] kelly_mac06: they were discussing the tech
[6:51:10] caradea_: are they playing the battlefield mobs with morchie? lmao missed that
[6:51:25] kelly_mac06: OH i stand corrected
[6:51:27] kelly_mac06: interesting
[6:51:43] TBouse: gingi does no damage on 1st pull because of the safe spot, maybe a way for him to do damage
[6:53:54] TBouse: cant remember any time in recent history that Echo just got gapped in a clean run
[6:54:00] AGuyWithPants: ^
[6:54:07] alatryste: How did zaelia went through the portal while having aggro with the rift mod?

[6:56:33] Whitewolf1441: @TBouse theres no good way to place the cam
[6:56:39] Jubeii99: hotw :s
[6:56:44] AGuyWithPants: legendary didnt do the gate
[6:57:11] AGuyWithPants: wait i thought they didnt but theres a gate here now Hmmge
[6:57:36] pnavara: you can gate from bottom too
[6:59:06] AGuyWithPants: Oh I thought u could only gate from the top
[6:59:39] Noyus_: echo is so far ahead

[7:01:11] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[7:02:25] pnavara: parkour
[7:02:27] Noyus_: gg's
[7:02:34] Whitewolf1441: both teams need trash
[7:02:45] nash25pl: how to throw the game wait 20s to pull last boss
[7:02:55] Owlcopwn: tilted out of their minds
[7:03:00] scheriel: i think echo loses this
[7:03:00] nash25pl: that pull was just unhinged
[7:03:16] alkhean: Lepan lagged 2 wins into losses in upper bracket and then vs Echo in losers Sadge At least we see them in finals as top 4 qualified
[7:03:18] Scikey: fullscreened, oof
[7:03:20] smebbswow: Fullscreen'd Sadge
[7:03:22] Funkytree: baited by cool tech, rip
[7:03:32] Noyus_: almost 9min
[7:03:34] Noyus_: wtf
[7:04:05] Whitewolf1441: i wonder if the bird cast the fear before getting to them so they couldnt interrupt?
[7:04:06] TBouse: gingi not being able to dps on the 1st pull makes me think they could go sub 9, but idk how they'd deal with juggernauts
[7:04:15] 4stronauth: Clap
[7:04:26] nash25pl: 5-10 ilvl more on each player and sub 9 happens
[7:04:39] nash25pl: it littery numbers game
[7:04:54] sw0ngs: if zaellia plays druid for the versa buff
[7:05:04] sw0ngs: robin doesnt fall down... sub 9min?
[7:05:07] Whitewolf1441: watch this
[7:05:09] nash25pl: but then u lose paladin auras
[7:05:17] nash25pl: and utility
[7:05:18] nash25pl: and lego char
[7:05:23] Funkytree: well the ilvl is pretty much set as they can pick their gear, so not rly:P
[7:05:38] alkhean: @sw0ngs dps pulled last boss as soon as he was hostile so no dps loss there. It wasn't 20 sec :D
[7:05:53] nash25pl: yes cause there is a cap each season on ilvl
[7:06:04] Whitewolf1441: @nash25pl you know what it is?

[7:13:20] SevzyYEP: but the bear.. KEKW
[7:13:28] MicHawkh: godcomp? kekw, bear is not a god

[7:16:15] arcanitejr: How long would it take someone to be a beginner in M+ to being a competitor in MDI?
[7:16:27] mattchewk: if you put down a efflo circle while not in combat and a teammate whos in combat runs in and gets healed does that put you in combat?
[7:16:34] daddygamerfb: can you imagine snapping a boss onto another boss lol
[7:16:47] Remnxnt: how talented are you
[7:17:31] sw0ngs: @daddygamerfb thats the dream, thats what they always try first.
[7:17:58] cheesey_oce: do you think there should be 'mdi keys' on live where you score for time rather than key level

[8:15:25] explopain: yeah i waiting for best druid
[8:15:40] ragepiez: good to have a break sometimes too though. get some intel haha. and it's cool getting to watch your take on it
[8:15:56] MrXanderOG: Looking at these teams now, do you think your team would have been this competitive?
[8:16:36] Whitewolf1441: echo still needs trash
[8:16:39] Fracture93: hey jb your yt stream seems to be stuck btw, reloaded multiple times on multiple devices but its broken

[8:17:37] alatryste: Do you think that blizz forcing teams to play a healer in their comp would be positive?
[8:18:06] shortsniperxbt: Echo is pretty good ngl
[8:18:19] nash25pl: this is what i like from pro player They took their shit play and turned it into a win
[8:18:20] alkhean: forcing healer would suck. I loved 4 dps runs back in Legion and even this expo in s1 MDI
[8:18:29] Bobugs: Looking at that run, im shocked echo not further ahead considering 4 dps
[8:18:55] alkhean: @Bobugs they have to play some stuff safer like focus tree on last boss
[8:19:21] Kyocere: freedom is pretty goat in eb

[8:34:04] AGuyWithPants: why can zaelia not just take the portal? why do they need to summon
[8:34:18] Terciob: Time to remove damage to spiteful :)
[8:35:03] Charm_pit: this is so cool
[8:35:13] Whitewolf1441: this mdi is everything i could have hoped for
[8:35:19] twinkieruler95: @jdotb do you think this is unfair? or do you think this is "clever use of game mechanics?"
[8:35:35] Whitewolf1441: @twinkieruler95 unfair would mean only one team has access to the strat
[8:35:52] sybtje: why wouldn't they ban rise?
[8:36:09] nash25pl: this is PEAK of WOW !
[8:36:31] smebbswow: Probably more confident in echo fucking up on rise vs atal
[8:36:34] sybtje: so  they hoping something goes wrong for echo in rise basicly

[8:40:52] sakecoke: They do but with a delay of  2 minutes or so
[8:40:52] Whitewolf1441: ah ok
[8:40:53] admiraltegetthoff: why isnt zaelia heart of the wild?
