[3:43:00] carlswaganonem: have the loot tables changed??
[3:43:06] Zidbeans: @jpat__ disagree tbh. Anything that's not the latest content is easy to overgear and brute force. FFXIV is more of a choreography routine rather than a strategy.
[3:43:11] Coffeeraptor: because mechanics are easier to see in car. the visual bloat in wow is terrible
[3:43:31] Coffeeraptor: *in ff14
[3:43:39] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[3:43:40] madawkk: @carlswaganonem yes they have
[3:43:42] jpat__: @jpat__ this is my first time playing thru wow and ffxiv and the wow dungeon are kicking my ass, the ones in bfa at least
[3:44:03] Zidbeans: Ah well dungeons yeah they're a little less faceroll than FFXIV dungeons that's for sure.
[3:44:09] jpat__: i just skipped over most of them and just quested
[3:44:09] guten_worgen: why are the naxx runs ending?  is the server moving to BC?
[3:44:18] carlswaganonem: @carlswaganonem Cool so 25 man drops extra gear now
[3:44:19] vohxcs: reminds me of the new world times
[3:44:24] jpat__: but so far im enjoying wow for a first time play through
[3:44:27] jpat__: close to 60
[3:44:37] Coffeeraptor: the scaling in BFA dungeons are broken for leveling afaik
[3:44:46] itsJellis: @jpat__ you're almost ready for the real game to start!
[3:44:51] mynameispain: these raids send back me to my high school times
[3:44:58] vicioussmite: yea bfa dungeons are way overtuned
[3:45:09] jpat__: @itsjellis i hear endgame is pretty dope looking forward to it
[3:45:18] Zidbeans: @jpat__ Dungeons while leveling are difficult in wow if nobody is doing any mechanics and just trying to faceroll... I'll bet everyone is lazy and trying to faceroll
[3:45:32] Death_Dono: Ulduar Kreygasm

[3:45:55] bkirii: does shroud pvp?
[3:46:03] Cap1che: @shroud how very ret paladin of you to not have damage meters showing
[3:46:09] Dumboodaking: whats your gearscore?
[3:46:21] okju5t1n: ret pally is a utility class, imo
[3:46:22] jpat__: @itsjellis yep been using that and icyvein i think it‚Äôs called also
[3:46:30] Death_Dono: on ICC you will do crazy dps
[3:46:31] SpacemanJohn: paladins one of those classes where your gs is higher than your dps kek
