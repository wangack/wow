[0:38:25] Dberjerak823: I dont think The Move lost game 1 to ping lol
[0:38:25] cptjohnnnn: why not just LAN?
[0:38:29] cptjohnnnn: the fuck haha
[0:38:32] Wicks_TV: and they lost on NA ping game 5 right?

[0:38:48] paul_muaddib4: @nox1o it wouldn’t be a problem if there wasn’t so much money on the line
[0:38:50] DeyPlays: Why not put the servers in the atlantic, everyone gets the same ping,...

[1:03:18] corebitz: corebitz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! What it do
[1:03:19] Turkeypitz: @Maximum check out Warriors vs celtics
[1:03:19] Niroggo: EU SIT DOWN USA
[1:03:24] txrb: it 100% did
[1:03:26] winterstretch: I sniped a comment about abusing 200 ping after the cross kill
[1:03:28] goldenjerdiss: did echo just phone it in early or did liquid just pull it out?
[1:03:29] himaniax: Always so cringe to me, the EU vs NA thing, as a EU liquid fan
[1:03:29] kdctheman: Is there a clip of max's inital reaction?
[1:03:32] karbonMAYne: dude that is real esports
[1:03:32] paul_muaddib4: isn’t this what you always complain about during the race and why you put chat sub only mode?
[1:03:33] mrduckytom: finals can still be a rematch between echo and liquid
[1:03:37] shunsha: go Asia team!
[1:03:43] alexchopstix: Yeah today deffinitely peaked already
[1:03:45] danksly: cdew has been seen practicing roundhouse kicks
[1:03:45] polygoncoke: @himaniax same
[1:03:48] alexchopstix: that was insane
[1:03:49] xxxtheinternet42069xxx: Inches Miles Cups has to be the best NA bat chest of all time
[1:03:51] Pyntas: @himaniax Agreed
[1:03:54] himaniax: @polygoncoke garf
[1:03:55] SirBlayks: Cdew punched EU in the face
[1:03:56] theDirtyon3: @paul_muaddib4 we are laughing at them not endorsing it
[1:03:58] lumaday: its like the ncaa march madness. best games happen in the semis most years.
[1:04:01] waldoishere: I saw the script. Trill 1v3s in game 5 in grand finals
[1:04:08] Nickystr1x: for echo it is very real
[1:04:09] Madcatmk02: FGC nah
[1:04:11] goldenjerdiss: it has been in dota as well
[1:04:13] paul_muaddib4: @thedirtyon3 you kinda are tho
[1:04:25] Nickystr1x: whaaz is not a guy that likes losing very many times in a row
[1:04:27] theDirtyon3: @paul_muaddib4 found the EU guy
[1:04:27] mrduckytom: upper bracket getss homeping first?
[1:04:28] AnnaXOXD: which team is which
[1:04:31] Ardenth: good luck having the mental in the rematch, that has to be ruthless if it happens
[1:04:35] cheese_beaver: warrior just takes zero damage
[1:04:36] Ruinx81: This PvP takes too long, need more SoD one shots
[1:04:40] Nonnar: You should get some stats on that, from some dota stats I saw before I think the UB wins like 70%
[1:04:43] Sepiyat: Isn't it because people are upset that there isn't a double final if the loser wins?
[1:05:03] Kamehameshaw: wow pvp looks like a completely different game
[1:05:12] paul_muaddib4: @thedirtyon3 cringe
[1:05:23] goldenjerdiss: cuz its double elim right?
[1:05:24] nomcarver00: lower bracket should have to get an extra win or something?
[1:05:26] wowtrucker: Thats the way it should be
[1:05:28] zeckzeckzeck: have to lose twice
[1:05:29] Scoops__: yeah double elim
[1:05:29] CoachCurd: Double elim everywhere except finals is weird.
[1:05:35] Grimm303: I think its cause it would take so long
[1:05:36] auby6: the biggest talking point in fighting games is best of 2 or best of 3 arguement
[1:05:43] shunsha: is raiku using the classic box warglaives appearance? ones that illidan had in well of eternity?
[1:05:47] wowtrucker: Yep and that's bs that they only have to lose once
[1:05:49] Seventhedeadly: its best out of 7 though right?
[1:05:53] Seventhedeadly: the Grand Finals?
[1:05:56] Sepiyat: In theory you'd have to watch up to 14 games
[1:05:56] knersh_: dota is the same and it's better it's a bo 5 anyway
[1:06:00] Madcatmk02: MDI would take WAYYY too long you could probably do it in AWC
[1:06:01] goldenjerdiss: i think making it a longer series is a decent compromise though
[1:06:02] PepeElToro805: Yeah but FGC sets are like 5 minutes.
[1:06:11] winterstretch: gnome warrior goes hard
[1:06:19] Sepiyat: Best compromise, Best of 9 imo
[1:06:22] whiteboy1136: hi max
[1:06:29] auby6: FGC first to 2 or first to 3
[1:06:34] CoachCurd: Alternatively could do 3/5 but winners side has 1 win already.
[1:06:35] BipolarPongal: man, it's so nice to see when they land gouge
[1:06:36] nomcarver00: maybe lower bracket has to win by 2 kind of thing
[1:06:39] Kamehameshaw: hes part sniffen
[1:06:42] Piki9: pvp talent

[1:07:31] exomaths: fueson, we have a problem
[1:07:34] nellfin: becoming diglet could be a sick immunity for shaman in PvE
[1:07:38] cheese_beaver: xdd druid mana

[1:08:19] theDirtyon3: Echo in shambles
[1:08:19] Nickystr1x: they call it "getting trunked" keep watching you'll see it
[1:08:20] vodin__: Mana is the ultimate decider
[1:08:20] Jumanjiqt: DH has an ability where they go meta form and go on a charge thing
[1:08:20] auby6: ping diff
[1:08:20] Wicks_TV: Raiku had netherwalk
[1:08:21] dorki: does echo suck in pvp
[1:08:22] TheLuo: Unfiltered raw rizz that's how

[1:08:33] theDirtyon3: @dorki their team had some changes this tier
[1:08:36] madtrade2600: chibaku is really good
[1:08:38] LazerBeemz: Raiku so focused on complaining about ping diff on twitter that he wasnt prepared for an EU team
[1:08:40] dknamey: resto suck ???
[1:08:42] logic__: @dorki yeah only pve players :)
[1:08:45] iPsyop: Lontar mana management is not too hot lol..
[1:08:46] shea4it: other melee been real quiet since DH went elephant mode
[1:08:46] mortiswow: the dig won the game
[1:08:46] wowtrucker: At least I. This series echo can't qq about ping
[1:08:49] prosthetic_boipussi: Echo hasnt been the same in PvP since they lost Mehx.
[1:08:49] waldoishere: @dorki they used to be unstoppable at pvp
[1:08:53] exage_: Echo's mental is likely destroyed after that liquid match, its not easy to recover
[1:08:54] Nox1o: I think Echo just going for the lose strat to get their old healer back
[1:08:55] auby6: @Goats48 yes im being and asshole about it , u know a real dick
[1:09:05] aelysqt: echo has chan greatest lock ever
[1:09:06] taanzfour: @dorki nah they win pretty much every season just like mdi
[1:09:14] Rohnan: script?
[1:09:29] hearthledgerlol: Joel2
[1:09:53] Nickystr1x: @aelysqt chan is like the pvp thd. goated at warlock and always dobby
[1:09:55] lophtxd: is this event on EU or NA servers?
[1:10:01] Wicks_TV: he had netherwalk just greeded it
[1:10:06] Goats48: @auby6 bro what?
[1:10:08] paul_muaddib4: @maximum you said people in the scene told you the whole ping debate is overblown? what about Sam’s tweet tho
[1:10:14] aelysqt: @Nickystr1x true
[1:10:21] theDirtyon3: no shot
[1:10:23] mrduckytom: @lophtxd both
[1:10:23] whiteboy1136: no
[1:10:25] Wicks_TV: he threw he had an immunity up
[1:10:28] Esotraz: Raiku prob does
[1:10:28] NotD4k: trill diff
[1:10:30] Grimm303: na it was just actually that close
[1:10:30] BipolarPongal: Shaman had no mana
[1:10:30] Daracus98: they could have stalled
[1:10:31] hearthledgerlol: Both are true
[1:10:32] auby6: @Goats48 sarcasmn??? hello
[1:10:35] Theblueninjashen: the healer was totally oom
[1:10:36] SirBlayks: Trill diffy
[1:10:37] murloc_oracle: lontar was at 0,0000000% mana
[1:10:37] certified86: Trill diff
[1:10:37] b1det: healer had no mana anyways so trill just went for the kill
[1:10:38] Nickystr1x: echo isnt really a "lose to their mental" kinda team
[1:10:38] Esotraz: Raiku did not have to go in
[1:10:38] punkekw: I think they thought liquid would leave
[1:10:38] Incipio: they def feel like it atleast
[1:10:40] Daracus98: lontar had no mana
[1:10:41] Grimm303: lontar just oo oom to heal
[1:10:41] demyt90: imo chan should fear trill not cdew
[1:10:42] theDirtyon3: Tripod Trill
[1:10:45] Daracus98: t dh could have kitedbu
[1:10:47] Turkeypitz: I'd said they thought they won, reacted too late?
[1:10:58] shunsha: the thing they could’ve done different is have the shaman try and drink. but even then Raiku prob still dies.
[1:10:59] Grimm303: dh was in meta
[1:11:01] Drase0117: dh had glimpse
[1:11:05] MooHamOinkBeef: A shammy usually shouldn't get out mana'd by a dargon I think
[1:11:11] samaxis: The casters mentioned if they had slowed down and sham get a drink
[1:11:16] madtrade2600: i mean they are the best player of the world with insane reflex i doubt they were 'surprised'
[1:11:17] whiteboy1136: having a personal off cd doesnt matter if you cant press it during a stun XD
[1:11:17] Grimm303: jelly was watching it and saying he wouldve done the same thing
[1:11:19] shunsha: innervate diff
[1:11:20] Esotraz: Trill was on fear dr
[1:11:21] b1det: maybe if dh chill for a bit
[1:11:25] Esotraz: Dh has to run
[1:11:26] paul_muaddib4: couldve drank
[1:11:27] BipolarPongal: I think Dorki would've won that
[1:11:27] Nickystr1x: @shunsha druid is literally the only healer that can drink this season with rogues and dhs flying across the map
[1:11:31] larkhill: no way theyre thinking rationally enough to know they didnt throw
[1:11:35] wowtrucker: I think the shammy should have drank immediately after Sam goes down
[1:11:46] demyt90: imo chan should fear trill not cdew
[1:11:48] samaxis: Its not intuitive but slowing damage and kiting for mana/time they could have still done it.
[1:11:49] aelysqt: druid has easy drinks cause of shadowmeld too
[1:11:55] shunsha: @nickystr1x Usain Bolting across the map this season
[1:12:07] Nickystr1x: people who think they're just gonna drink against tripod trill are actually on a different planet kekw
[1:12:10] Esotraz: @demyt90 trill was on fear dr
[1:12:21] danksly: so we want echo to go up so we can slap em back down right
[1:12:28] SlowboLaggins: @wowtrucker its easy to say in hindsight though
[1:12:30] danksly: CATW
[1:12:41] Tarryble: series
[1:12:44] theDirtyon3: we always wanna beat echo YEP
[1:12:44] SlowboLaggins: YEP
[1:12:46] Bigmoran: We need the content
[1:12:47] Nickystr1x: yeah lemme sit down and have a cuppa tea while this cracked out pirate is barreling down on me and killing my whole team
[1:12:48] Goats48: @auby6  Chatting
[1:12:49] Sepiyat: We want Echo vs Liquid Game 7
[1:12:49] auby6: raiku is tilted
[1:12:51] dorki: where's pikaboo
[1:12:51] taanzfour: hairy meatball team kinda stronk
[1:12:55] wowtrucker: Get cdew on the raid roster ASAP @maximum
[1:12:58] Sepiyat: I don't think we want Echo or Liquid to sweep
[1:12:59] Esotraz: HOME
[1:13:00] aelysqt: getting drinks against outlaw is always hard
[1:13:01] LionButLeon: xdd
[1:13:08] ZeroDMGDealt: sadge
[1:13:16] auby6: @Goats48 yea its usually hard for people to get sarcasm through text... understandable
[1:13:17] exomaths: gotta respect a dh that can minmax his pump like that ^^ im a dh main myself (1750 shuffle cr) so I know how many cds you need to manage on that class, wp.
[1:13:35] TheLuo: I miss the cata era comp names.
[1:13:46] nodenvers: LIQUID is not interested in entering the MDI?
[1:14:07] iPsyop: I just realized RMD isn't super common anymore
[1:14:08] aelysqt: old comp names were so funny like ebola cleave
[1:14:28] shunsha: woah
[1:14:50] Lee_mes: kinda hard to follow with 2 of each class
[1:15:16] Powzoar: we do expect maximum screen space here
[1:15:20] ShaggySummers: @Lee_mes this is a problem, agreed
[1:15:20] Powzoar: ;)
[1:15:26] Itskrugs: Haha, MAXimized
[1:15:30] iPsyop: @aelysqt what was that unholy DK, feral druid ? lol..
[1:15:35] theDirtyon3: xddShrug
[1:15:36] iiamBaro: they are so tanky
[1:15:37] TheLuo: hella CDs
[1:15:38] karbonMAYne: so much control
[1:15:38] aelysqt: @iPsyop yeah lol
[1:15:39] sycotic_x: They just don't oom
[1:15:39] Grimm303: its good against other casters
[1:15:43] exomaths: xddShrug
[1:15:45] nardha_nik: Great pvp kit and mana
[1:15:48] Seventhedeadly: Hella Mana
[1:15:53] gillickw: they dont have mana issues
[1:15:53] auby6: hex off fear
[1:15:55] bonkeyyykong: control and big mana pool
[1:15:57] karbonMAYne: idk if there is a ton of synergy, its just insane
[1:16:01] shaayynee: we're all 1500, we dunno
[1:16:01] onthatproxy: mana efficiency
[1:16:03] xdtai: @Maximum they have a 12s kick, its really insane against any caster comp tbh
[1:16:05] aelysqt: its good cause of control and hex
[1:16:05] exage_: It covers control WL/DH lacks
[1:16:06] Esotraz: Its really good
[1:16:09] Bigmoran: Shaman has efficient, but weaker defensive cooldowna and can support offensively. Warlock/DH defensives carry the void.
[1:16:10] holmat: mana
[1:16:15] nardha_nik: Cleave is only bad comp to play as sham. If they train sham.
[1:16:17] Daracus98: They dont heal as much as druid, but the control paired with wlock and dh lets them be offensive
[1:16:18] aelysqt: also has best ranged kick
[1:16:18] reazer125: mana and vesitility
[1:16:22] Necrootide: Good utility with grounding tremor and a short range kick
[1:16:27] TheLuo: I think it's less about the sham being good and more about lock/DH being meta and sham works best in that comp.
[1:16:34] nodenvers: LIQUID is not interested in entering the MDI?
[1:16:38] shea4it: remember danimals? the drinkable yogurt?
[1:16:39] iPsyop: Shaman has a lot of utility and mana regen.
[1:16:43] Orkk0: warlock are tanky and cans tay alive really well. SO does DH.
[1:16:44] holmat: lontar lost with mana last game, shaman had 70% mana left
[1:16:48] auby6: fear into hex, lightning lasso is really good too
[1:16:53] xdtai: @Maximum they dont go oom, they have a short cd kick, they have static field for micro cc, they have grounding totem, they pretty much just have an answer to every situation

[1:16:53] blackwooloo: playing lock into a good rsham feels like such a losing battle
[1:16:58] xJxlly: insanely disruptive vs. casters, very good at healing stationary targets (warlocks), super annoying to play against if youre a dh
[1:17:03] iPsyop: @nodenvers they have people in the MDI they just don't have a team Liquid in the MDI
[1:17:14] ligament_champion: i have no idea whats happening
[1:17:31] Centriuzz: Man observer hits so hard
[1:17:37] adleydarling: i miss rsham on jaina
[1:17:38] oilerr: @ligament_champion same
[1:17:39] theDirtyon3: any good stacking fight
[1:17:41] adleydarling: when you just were an SLT Bot and did dmg
[1:17:43] Firelord_Trolldemort: cata classic shamans will be good raid healers
[1:17:47] Nonnar: Was nathria last time we had shams?
[1:17:47] tbingtv: Never the need a redesign
[1:17:48] tempehst11: after maevy retires?
[1:17:52] Orkk0: the healer has lots of tools to slow down and control the enemy while can he can do damage without worrying for the team to die.
[1:17:52] theDirtyon3: fair
[1:17:52] bumpa3: that darkness was a throw
[1:17:53] SisuGamingTv: maximumDont

[1:38:33] TheLuo: Fighting AWC streamers in the 1600 bracket risking the same number of points as they are because 2s is a "throw away" bracket.
[1:38:33] dknamey: Elepants
[1:38:37] taanzfour: well the enemy team with no blizzcon chapmion on their team is probably a lil bit furstrated
[1:38:37] Regroot_Gaming: Literally every streamer that does that Like pika he just warms up with some viewers at lower rating like 1.8k ish
[1:38:37] kaigasm: the elephants with pants was not weird....and was accurate
[1:38:37] Sover31gn: I love elephants

[2:04:08] wowtrucker: @maximum and comparing the emotions of tindral to the game 5 isn't the same. Harboring those emotions and refocusing for a rematch within an hour is different then harnessing those emotions going into another boss that will take several days
[2:04:09] Kawjiryu: what if liquid say fuckit and send dh/dk and run at chan all game
[2:04:13] Nox1o: @Standy94 might be onto something. playing outlaw with high ping was giga bad

[2:04:29] KungGrim: Mate 120 or more ping is a HUUUGE factor
[2:04:36] sidoh_: isnt rogue/spriest awful on bad ping?
[2:04:38] dskamin29: chanimal plays in australia, he has awful ping every game so its probably overhyped
[2:04:38] bublzzzz: @Maximum EU is playing with 174 to NA. That's insane.
[2:04:44] Tereekel: this happens so often with Liquid, if they make it to GF through upper bracket their momentum gets broken and they lose, I hope they can turn it around
[2:04:46] Standy94: You can play WW with 1000 ping just send it
[2:04:47] thundamental: trying to kick clone casts 0.5 sec
[2:04:52] yama_class: why tf did I think of a new ping system
[2:04:53] Madmaori: ping convo = RWF time difference convo
[2:04:58] wowtrucker: EU always makes excuses when they lose. I'm over it
[2:05:00] johanoxd: Echo playing with 170 ping on na
[2:05:00] Wicks_TV: @bublzzzz they just won with it so can't be that crazy
[2:05:02] goesidd: @dskamin29 he lives in France these days
[2:05:03] arnyjebuh: in league of legends it feels like really big deal tbh
[2:05:06] othernewname: im gonna put servers in the middle of the ocean
[2:05:06] Docaan: 130 ping is literally my ping in every game, finally people understand my suffering
[2:05:08] alishark_: lol
[2:05:13] dskamin29: ok that makes a lot of sense lol
[2:05:13] paul_muaddib4: Sam literally said it’s a big deal lol
[2:05:16] SalmiraMH: 0.1-0.2s is quite a lot in pvp
[2:05:17] GeaR614: 130 is about the point where it starts to make a difference. 200 is basically unplayable
[2:05:18] sednajoan: @Madmaori exactly
[2:05:18] Crumikz: Raiku has 200!ping tho hard to kick
[2:05:29] dskamin29: prev was from new zealand im p sure and he was a god despite the ping
[2:05:29] MooKalti: I feel like if the ping stays consistent it's ok, the problem comes in if the ping is going between 100 and 200 variably
[2:05:32] KungGrim: I competed in Rocket League & playing on NA servers with more than 120 ms was aids, probably the same here, there is a big difference of 70-80 and 120-160 ms
[2:05:32] alishark_: there is a huge difference between 30 and 130
[2:05:33] Esotraz: 180 ms trying to kick a 0,8 sec clone is rough
[2:05:42] Standy94: In vanilla I had 300 Ms and thought that was normal
[2:05:45] paul_muaddib4: echo said they’re playing on 180 ping
[2:05:50] Provenskill: blizz too poor to host a LAN Sadge
[2:05:53] SnekVen0m: Can they setup a server in the middle of the sea to make it equal
[2:05:58] Ajjoey01: is this the grand final?
[2:06:01] Theliahh: speed of light is a cringe limitation
[2:06:02] goesidd: Yes
[2:06:11] Docaan: Max have u tried 130 ping?
[2:06:12] Standy94: Playing rogue with high ping is cursed
[2:06:12] Ardenth: stable ping is the most important factor as well
[2:06:19] Kawjiryu: Chat you guys know that Liquid is playing on high ping every other game too right? people are acting like its only Echo dealing with it
[2:06:22] Diazanite: consistent ping is the only thing that really matters
[2:06:23] paul_muaddib4: that take is so crazy to me lol
[2:06:23] Goats48: you havnt played pvp bruh
[2:06:24] Tekaes: there is stuff you can't do with high ping
[2:06:24] Nox1o: i was pressing so many wrong globals when trying new outlaw on ptr with like 150. i kinda agree
[2:06:24] bublzzzz: @Maximum Liquid is 1-5 on EU ping this tournament
[2:06:24] Firenze32: huge L take
[2:06:27] Kawjiryu: Liquid only has "advantage" because they are higher seed
[2:06:29] othernewname: it depends a bit on the server tickrate as well, so maybe wow servers are shit and it truly doesnt matter that much
[2:06:30] taanzfour: ive played and it feels immediately noticable for me in pvp or pve
[2:06:33] KungGrim: Then you haven't played competitive PvP at a high level
[2:06:33] paul_muaddib4: coming from league 130 is literally unplayable
[2:06:33] moodsen: its a mental disadvantage
[2:06:34] iiamBaro: i play on both NA and EU, i only notice ping when its at 170+
[2:06:35] KungGrim: It's a huge diff
[2:06:37] hardcoded93: pvp requires split second timings - high ping will fk you
[2:06:37] wowtrucker: Literally no difference .
[2:06:38] sanatalive: anyone who thinks 30-130 makes a difference has to be a zoomer
[2:06:47] Docaan: @Diazanite packet loss is massive true but so is double digit ping
[2:06:49] goesidd: Cdew pve mace on this map
[2:06:50] paul_muaddib4: lmfao
[2:06:50] gretriku: I live in NA and play WoW in EU and my ping is always between 100-120 and 99.9% of the time it’s a non factor
[2:06:52] dskamin29: loser gets map + ping
[2:06:56] dskamin29: so its na ping
[2:06:58] bublzzzz: @Maximum this is NA ping advantage. Loser gets ping advantage
[2:07:00] aelysqt: 120 is the limit for me on wow
[2:07:00] KDaily: why is this broadcast so much better than mdi
[2:07:09] cheese_beaver: classic moonkin
[2:07:11] Theliahh: remember we all used to game on dialup PepeLaugh
[2:07:13] jojosgotmojo: DeMoN HuNtErS ArE FiNe!!!1111
[2:07:18] Fathomz: 7 ads wtf
[2:07:23] smashhammer: balance druid seems so squishy
[2:07:28] bublzzzz: @Maximum ping is loser advantage
[2:07:35] KDaily: no like the production value, the UI
[2:07:35] Zacaree55: This is NA @Maximum Cdew's EU evoker is red skinned.
[2:07:36] Pidly: That's not what they showed on one of their overlays earlier. I thought it said Loser gets ping advantage
[2:07:39] Standy94: If I have higher than 15 ms I don’t play that day
[2:07:42] The_Mail_Man__: so much more downtime in mdi than awc games
[2:07:42] dendebr: Its more about mental than anything, loose game in a match might make someone tilt if they believe they lost because of ping.
[2:07:44] SoFisht: supa/venruki/ziqo have been doing this for what like 10 years now too
[2:07:44] Zacaree55: His NA evoker is blue skinned
[2:07:52] Armagaren: home ping advantage
[2:07:53] Docaan: @sanatalive and anyone who doesn't is prob a player who plays with double digit ping, the amount of times i have dodged something yet got hit by it with +130 ping is incredibly tilting and frustrating
[2:07:56] hashtagnothankyou: no its the same every series, ping is loser server
[2:07:57] Piki9: you cant cast at this energy for a key, and just pumping pulls
[2:07:57] Dberjerak823: Why did Raiku say that they played all 3 games against the move on NA server then?
[2:08:01] Flipeled: @Zacaree55 this is the tournament realm
[2:08:02] arielleej: AWC also been around (in some form or another) since literally TBC
[2:08:25] MCjesperFC: Has there been ARMS played today?
[2:08:26] Zacaree55: @Flipeled Im aware. his evoker is diff color skins on diff regions.
[2:08:53] alishark_: MES needs to be joined for the next game
[2:09:08] The_Mail_Man__: BANG

[2:09:53] gertriK: both games were NA ping
[2:09:53] Theblueninjashen: they are showing us that ping doesn't matter x)
[2:09:56] hardcoded93: trill doing almost double the other dps lol
[2:09:58] MrChaCho: But I thought all the chatters just said the ping advantage was MASSIVE
[2:09:59] hadoukyn: trill 100k casual dps
[2:10:00] Wicks_TV: wait are they alternating no I think its loser gets ping
[2:10:02] Altairian8: clear proof that high ping is actually better, give us higher pings blizzard

[2:10:11] djangochained: We got this obese friends
[2:10:11] NotD4k: @gertriK Dentge
[2:10:12] paul_muaddib4: n=2 and people say it doesn’t matter. wow players aren’t the smartest for real lmao
[2:10:12] boselly127: i love that they are playing at the same venue. that is huge for moral, it feels cool for them to all play together in the same room for the first time in a long ish time.
[2:10:14] Seventhedeadly: Cdew Miles...  Sam  Inches... Trill Cups
[2:10:18] Provenskill: it literally alternates
[2:10:19] aidsmeister1: @Docaan used to play fps competitively in a small region for a small game. would be so funny when the 7 ping players would say ping doesn't matter. when a server finally got introduced between us they'd find any excuse not to play on it lmao, they'd still be like 20 ping.
[2:10:20] keleksbreath: pretty sure it's OCE ping
[2:10:25] regis_philbin_: both are middle eastern ping
[2:10:25] taanzfour: its a lan what are you talkin about
[2:10:27] Standy94: @maximum Have you seen the outlaw macro that lets you step kick and grapple back insta
[2:10:34] Turkeypitz: no idea, question - is spell queuing a thing and can that bypass ping issues in some cases?
[2:10:47] shagamuffn: People need to stop cooking about the ping and listen
[2:10:51] himaniax: So Cdews evoker is green on EU, an not on NA ye?
[2:10:53] wowtrucker: I'd just ban people that keep trolling the ping shit
[2:10:59] tmAwkward: ziqo also said raiku having ping disadvantage this rpund. maybe he misspoke
[2:11:09] Evan_Ralston: NOTED
[2:11:20] Kawjiryu: It still swaps every time
[2:11:21] xxunklekarlxx: its not a lane
[2:11:25] Flipeled: it's not different
[2:11:25] xxunklekarlxx: *lan
[2:11:28] Standy94: EU also has Middle Ages infrastructure so they are used to dog ping
[2:11:37] gertriK: I'm basing off what Ziqo said while casting, he said on first game "Raiku interrupted even on high ping"
[2:11:37] Pidly: Not sure I if I can post youtube video but overlay shows losing team gets ping advantage on the AWC stream.
[2:11:37] silver_0001: i have no evidence but i think you're lying
[2:11:38] CiTRiNiTE: but cdews EU evoker is red im pretty sure
[2:11:40] dskamin29: thats the opposite of what pika said on stream ...
[2:11:48] dskamin29: pika said the exact opposite of that max
[2:11:50] Zynneh: @Standy94 i think you spelt NA wrong
[2:11:55] dskamin29: and he plays
[2:11:56] foghagymatyi: @Standy94 Huh??? EU has way better internet then NA
[2:11:57] Crumikz: Ziqo just said last 2 was NA
[2:11:58] FoxiekittenWoW: loser get to pick region
[2:12:04] Wicks_TV: thats the opposite of what Raiku and Pika said it worked
[2:12:06] kags158: no hate max but the overlay has showed loser gets ping advantage
[2:12:10] Standy94: Try running fiber through a damn castle in EU
[2:12:19] Pidly: ***
[2:12:21] Kawjiryu: pika isnt the most reliable source lol
[2:12:21] Sothis_best_girl: wat? EU has like 20ms ping usually to anywhere else in EU LUL
[2:12:23] wowtrucker: Nah european server ping is goated
[2:12:27] SoFisht: Chatters really are just typing huh Chatting

[2:12:54] Ghostfumes111: I have 133 ms on NA
[2:12:55] VeroxReact: EU Clap
[2:12:55] luixun: germany is the only place with bad infra and is new to the internet xD rest of eu is good
[2:12:56] alishark_: my ping is 3 (in-game)
[2:12:57] krasull90: im from EU , our internet here is dogshit :D
[2:12:57] exomaths: what is that magic snowball ability?
[2:12:57] runekfgotbanned: thats crazy
[2:12:59] Aro725: @dskamin29 that man is fried. 0 chance youre the higher seed and get away team ping first game. They said the opposite on official broadcast in the beginning of the tourney.
[2:13:01] Ghostfumes111: Most of the time is fine
[2:13:03] lacusdark: is 80 ping considered bad ?

[2:13:11] LionButLeon: @krasull90 internet might be "dogshit" but our ping isn't
[2:13:15] LionButLeon: EZ
[2:13:19] alqallafi: eternal palace was 6 years ago right ? maybe its def now @Maximum
[2:13:19] Shroomztm: Doesn't that mean that eu routing is turbo bad?
[2:13:20] Nox1o: that highly depends on server location
[2:13:22] MooKalti: 'magic snowball' from Trill lol, wtf is that?
[2:13:25] clickermekk: what is magic snowball from trill in details?
[2:13:33] Standy94: Cable management in a 700 year old stone house has to be trash
[2:13:38] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Man, I really hope we get at least 1 mdps support class in TWW. I really love the fantasy of the augvoker, but I am SO bad are playing rdps.
[2:13:40] Aro725: this is supposed to be just a fun tourney for NA EU

[2:14:25] Igneas15: Chicago itself would have been better than LA yea
[2:14:26] hadoukyn: just put a server in the ocean between eu and na
[2:14:28] exomaths: or just install servers on a ship in the middle of the sea

[2:15:43] CiTRiNiTE: yeah his EU dragon is red
[2:15:45] Nox1o: so it is losers choice?
[2:15:46] LionButLeon: Wokege
[2:15:49] Zacaree55: Cdew's pres on NA is BLUE skinned. Cdew's Pres is red.
[2:15:51] Vidiction: Wokege
[2:15:58] The_Mail_Man__: i can't find it in the rules at all
[2:16:00] punkekw: Cdew always clutch wtf
[2:16:01] bluenxd: even on the overlay it says losers get ping advantage
[2:16:04] Wicks_TV: it was yesterday too
[2:16:07] jannekvarnc: chair is about to get obliterated i can feel it
[2:16:12] fleks27: human error always exists
[2:16:15] Trodenskjold: Max the ping will always be the opposite of what you say. thats how it works
[2:16:15] LionButLeon: GASP
[2:16:16] bublzzzz: @Maximum The graphic at start of today said loser ping
[2:16:19] happyheals: loser gets ping adv right?
[2:16:19] Standy94: What if red dragons just don’t heal as much
[2:16:19] Piki9: I think red and blue dragon is the only way we can tell for now
[2:16:25] Provenskill: sam just made of paper i guess
[2:16:26] glow_xd: maybe first seed chooses which server first, like kicking or recieving in football xd
[2:16:26] AingealanLann: @maximum Watch how long it takes to get into game after the draft. That is how you know if they're switching servers.
[2:16:29] regis_philbin_: monkaW
[2:16:31] Nox1o: so it was NA-NA-EU, correct?
[2:16:33] Powzoar: dragon is such a cool looking healer.
[2:16:34] Nox1o: and losers choice
[2:16:38] CiTRiNiTE: @Nox1o yep
[2:16:43] Scriix: boomies, squishy in raid, sqiushy in pvp heh
[2:16:45] gertriK: Based on what Ziqo said while casting, it seemed like the 1st game was on NA, but I have no idea
[2:16:46] Powzoar: Save your friend, roar a bit, have fire breath
[2:16:47] bublzzzz: yes
[2:16:49] Bittermandel: What is this damage
[2:16:53] Nox1o: need a cdew color tracker KEKW

[2:17:03] ebosilovich: playing druid cant be fun
[2:17:04] Docaan: LOL
[2:17:06] TattersAU: Are PvP players still pretending these maps are significantly different? Like they cant wait to run from one pillar to another
[2:17:07] shogunmaster2: does trill still raid?
[2:17:11] Onyo1337: rng server KEKW
[2:17:11] alegpetrovich: the players said its loser advantage so
[2:17:15] alegpetrovich: echo team said it
[2:17:15] fleks27: the trill details dps shown being bugged is too funny
[2:17:17] LionButLeon: YEP
[2:17:19] Zacaree55: YES 100%
[2:17:19] danksly: one guy knows and he's watching lotr
[2:17:20] CiTRiNiTE: yeah we're positive
[2:17:21] Standy94: Wouldn’t vers main stat classes just be lit in PVP?
[2:17:25] bublzzzz: yes
[2:17:26] tipmax1: uwu
[2:17:28] Kawjiryu: what if the dragon color is opposite?
[2:17:29] Kaylorqt: 100% red is EU
[2:17:31] happyheals: yeah the red one is saltier
[2:17:33] Jazrial: Dude Max we used to have to play LoL on an NA server from OCE, was impossible to play some champs. WoW wasn't that bad
[2:17:36] JonBarackSnow: they show the rules in todays vod at 31:50-32:30
[2:17:36] Zynneh: It was blue last game
[2:17:39] tipikus: what is that red beam from cdew to sam
[2:17:40] Zynneh: so xddShrug
[2:17:47] CiTRiNiTE: but if he class swaps we're f'd
[2:17:49] bublzzzz: correct
[2:17:53] Standy94: Red Coats are EU confirmed
[2:17:55] Nox1o: its jusst full yolo CAUGHT
[2:17:55] glow_xd: LOL
[2:17:57] LionButLeon: goes hard
[2:17:59] Vidiction: BASED
[2:18:01] MrDread: they trolling you xdd
[2:18:03] taanzfour: maybe cdew is trolling changing his scale color
[2:18:03] fleks27: all good just ignore em next time CAUGHT
[2:18:04] bublzzzz: if seeds equal coin flip first game then loser @Maximum
[2:18:07] thenateo2: Pretty sure this is chinese servers
[2:18:07] subbby: Man just yapping
[2:18:09] RealApexPredator: why in the world would liquid not get ping advantage as the winners bracket champ
[2:18:10] Vidiction: spreading missinforamtion BASED
[2:18:11] happyheals: seed starts then loser gets it
[2:18:11] STR0US: Why wouldnt the upper finalist get the advantage..
[2:18:13] AingealanLann: The coin flip is only if the seeds across regions were the same.
[2:18:17] Cenarios13: why is sam playing guardian druid? Kappa
[2:18:19] Kaylorqt: The fact noone knows is too good lol
[2:18:19] imjonny1: cdew is playing dragon, not because it's best, but because it allows us to know
[2:18:19] Nox1o: wouldnt be the first time someone didnt know what was going on
[2:18:27] Provenskill: I was told by admins they have each team logo on a turtles back and they let them race. The losing turtle gets ping advantage
[2:18:29] LionButLeon: WAYTOODANK
[2:18:32] darkgigaz: Need a screen overlap next to time saying which
[2:18:41] goldenjerdiss: cdew is a fucking lord dude
[2:18:41] Grimm303: dh is so dumb
[2:18:44] Kaylorqt: esports involving blizzard with confusion, never
[2:18:46] Nox1o: damn
[2:18:47] Nox1o: that totem
[2:18:47] Scoops__: how much damage
[2:18:47] regis_philbin_: omg
[2:18:49] Docaan: they are getting so shredded
[2:18:51] MCjesperFC: EUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[2:18:52] Trodenskjold: God damn
[2:18:54] SoFisht: fuckin hate playing into DH
[2:18:54] taanzfour: that shaman totem is so crazy good
[2:18:57] CiTRiNiTE: blue dragon time
[2:18:59] jannekvarnc: got pinged
[2:19:00] xxunklekarlxx: it might have been eu na eu
[2:19:00] Standy94: Sadly it does kinda seem like ping is a big diff
[2:19:00] theskot: can you CC DH
[2:19:01] tipikus: casual dh damage
[2:19:01] dreadnaught1031: nerf DH
[2:19:02] The_Mail_Man__: should go blue here
[2:19:03] tipikus: bro
[2:19:04] Nox1o: no we should go blue
[2:19:05] Nox1o: aka NA
[2:19:06] Docaan: Their dmg is ridiculous
[2:19:06] erdls: ping dif
[2:19:08] kags158: red dragon still
[2:19:08] dskamin29: there we go its loser ping u finally understand
[2:19:09] alishark_: ping :) told you
[2:19:10] Crumikz: Ez
[2:19:11] gambleragain: why would loser have ping advantage?
[2:19:16] danksly: coffin
[2:19:16] thegrt13: I think chat is just trolling... trust the admins
[2:19:18] regis_philbin_: LUL
[2:19:18] brosciencegym: toadphKekw
[2:19:18] happyheals: it feels like 80% or more of the home teams win
[2:19:20] eggman_br: theyre gettin this chicken rotisseried
[2:19:20] bublzzzz: @Maximum loser ping advantage makes all series go max games ;)
[2:19:23] Olivens: so you dont CRY
[2:19:29] othernewname: the reward is a point
[2:19:29] Nox1o: because content
[2:19:31] Hammerferge: does liquid have to lose twice?
[2:19:31] thegrt13: where did this red dragon tech come from?
[2:19:34] bublzzzz: @Maximum because it makes series go longer
[2:19:36] certified86: its great that Echo as the loser gets ping advantage in the finals. so stupid
[2:19:38] llamllap: so it wont be 3-0
[2:19:41] panacer: its to force longer series
[2:19:41] Zynneh: because you won with the advantage?
[2:19:43] dskamin29: i mean in sports when one side scores the other side gets the ball right
[2:19:43] Nox1o: this is primarily entertainment, so thats the prio
[2:19:43] swagggle: they want more comeback potential so series go the distance
[2:19:44] glow_xd: isnt that in most game
[2:19:45] thatfriggindude: Sam needs to play warlock... boomkin is too squishy
[2:19:46] Kawjiryu: because otherwise you could lose the whole series in the first game?
[2:19:48] glow_xd: games*
[2:19:48] Madcatmk02: that's typical in the FGC as well
[2:19:49] tipikus: it wouldnt be balanced. if ping is actually big, and you get the first good ping, you just roll them over
[2:19:50] Mewn: ChineseJoel
[2:19:51] Powzoar: big dog not comfy?
[2:19:51] alegpetrovich: u cant counter pick comp its only first game blindpick
[2:19:53] shunsha: either blind comp picks, loser pick map, or winner pick map, loser gets comp adv.
[2:19:56] Nicore2630: same for fighting games right?
[2:19:57] Flodaz: Isnt it: coin-flip on first match and then it just swaps region every other game after the first?
[2:20:00] Standy94: They play the same comp anyway every game
[2:20:00] regis_philbin_: i feel like there is no good way to navigate the ping diff
[2:20:04] punkekw: PvP ping affix
[2:20:05] dskamin29: if u started with ping and won u would keep ping the entire match then ...
[2:20:06] FoxiekittenWoW: loser ping advantage, but the first game is based on which seed you have going into the tournament. And since liquid is seed 1 and echo is seed 3 the game started on NA servers,
[2:20:07] Altairian8: the advantage for winning is you put a point on the board, fighting games do counterpicks the same way
[2:20:07] thatoneguynobodylikes352: And so you don't win the coin flip and then chain the ping advantage
[2:20:14] Vodrin: its same in FGC, only loser can swap character
[2:20:15] Nox1o: it really incentivizes trading games all the time
[2:20:15] GadgetCopter: it’s so the winner of the first game has an overall advantage
[2:20:15] othernewname: u just said ping doesnt matter NotLikeThis
[2:20:17] danksly: so u wanna win lose win lose so ur on ur ping for the decider
[2:20:18] gambleragain: @Maximum A good idea would be the an even number, and the first team with 2 games advantages wins.
[2:20:19] happyheals: because a lan would cost them too much moneyu that takes away from dividends
[2:20:22] kingcrow730: Because in a best of 5, if you win first game you would get map and comp advantage in game 5 if each team wins their map and comp picks
[2:20:23] unsteddy: yeah cross region tournaments are dumb, its jsut for fun
[2:20:27] kaigasm: confirmed NA had ping adv on first round then?
[2:20:28] rtcinema: Who does the team that scores a touchdown kickoff to the team that didn't score? Shouldn't they get the ball back for scoring? Similar logic, no?
[2:20:31] tipmax1: mostly that means if u win 1st - it most likely u will win the entire tourney
[2:20:32] TBouse: it makes perfect sense for a a production perspective
[2:20:33] thundamental: the biggest diff to other games liquid has played so far is that theyre saving kicks or kicking perfectly on sam, barely gets any precogs
[2:20:37] Vodrin: the alternative is they are just guessing counter-counterpicks
[2:20:37] Nox1o: that means the first game is insanely important because it most likely determines the winner in even games
[2:20:42] danksly: at least winning first is real important
[2:20:42] Hammerferge: does Liquid have to lose two full series?
[2:20:44] exomaths: plink NERF DRY FOOD plink BUFF WET FOOD plink NERF VACUUMS plink BUFF LASER POINTERS plink
[2:20:54] LIZARD_Monukuma: they played 2 NA and 1 EU now and now NA again
[2:20:54] certified86: liquid should''ve at least gotten ping advantage in the first game
[2:20:54] Zacaree55: Well. I think its time.
[2:21:02] xxMaverick: just got here but did you catch the semi final game 5?
[2:21:03] Nox1o: nah
[2:21:04] deoxxzz: 2 was on NA
[2:21:04] Nox1o: 2 were NA
[2:21:05] dskamin29: false
[2:21:05] Standy94: Game 2 looked way different
[2:21:07] Nox1o: and one EU
[2:21:07] dskamin29: game 1 was NA
[2:21:07] Zacaree55: Game 1 was NA
[2:21:11] hashtagnothankyou: game 1 was NA
[2:21:12] Nox1o: NA-NA-EU
[2:21:12] unsteddy: game 1 was NA ping
[2:21:13] runekfgotbanned: is it best of 5 or 7?
[2:21:13] tipmax1: 2 on na
[2:21:15] ThePdfreak: game 1 was on na ping
[2:21:16] Keppie__: isnt it the other way around
[2:21:17] Zynneh: 1-3 was NA, 2 was EU
[2:21:18] sednajoan: what is the red % number in the middle?
[2:21:20] gambleragain: Sam and Chanimal are fake gods, and it comes down to ping to pull of those fake kicks.
[2:21:21] dskamin29: eu won on na ping
[2:21:23] cheese_beaver: fredPls
[2:21:24] Zacaree55: We need Lord Mes @Maximum Release the Mesidan.
[2:21:27] alishark_: game 1 was Eu
[2:21:29] Hammerferge: @runekfgotbanned 7
[2:21:30] Kawjiryu: are we sure game 1 was NA? did they annouce who won the coin flip?
[2:21:37] Nox1o: first game is way too important with this
[2:21:42] Nox1o: i dont like it
[2:21:43] tipikus: yung time dilation ticking 60k
[2:21:44] 5ixer: @sednajoan Dampening. Global healing reduction which ramps up as the game continues
[2:21:45] JonBarackSnow: @sednajoan dampening
[2:21:46] CiTRiNiTE: game one was blue dragon
[2:21:47] fefefen: this was the first game on eu
[2:21:47] The_Mail_Man__: anyone wanna be the dragon checker
[2:21:47] Olivens: there was no coin flip, liquid high seed
[2:21:49] happyheals: game 1 was just a mistake being too aggressive, it was na
[2:21:49] demyt90: check dragon color in 1st game
[2:21:50] paul_muaddib4: chatting
[2:21:53] kaigasm: rewind check dragon color
[2:21:53] danksly: so if liquid wins now they're on echo ping for the decider now right
[2:21:55] Standy94: No one cares about the actual games just the ping lol
[2:21:57] danksly: or is it all made up
[2:21:57] Kawjiryu: I thought that it was a coin flip in the grand finals
[2:22:00] fefefen: game 1 was NA game 2 was NA game 3 EU
[2:22:05] tipmax1: 1st NA - 2nd NA - 3rd EU
[2:22:14] sednajoan: @5ixer thank you all
[2:22:24] Nox1o: thank god CDEW thought ahead for us
[2:22:25] sednajoan: @JonBarackSnow thx
[2:22:27] Esotraz: Check game 2 dragon aswell
[2:22:29] Unosojudio: liquid better win after the trash he talked on twitter about raiku complaining about ping lol
[2:22:38] taanzfour: cdew clutch
[2:22:38] Burritobizon: @Maximum what do you think of DH? Balanced?
[2:22:39] keleksbreath: the ol 2-2-1-1-1
[2:22:40] CiTRiNiTE: @Esotraz game 2 was 100% red
[2:22:47] Hej_Benny: god bless cdews dragon color
[2:22:50] The_Mail_Man__: @danksly bo7
[2:22:53] NotD4k: @Unosojudio Dentge 󠀀
[2:22:55] wowtrucker: They doing the 2-3-2 format or the 2-2-1-1-1
[2:22:57] Hammerferge: does Liquid have to lose two full series seeing as they haven't lost a series yet?
[2:22:59] Esotraz: @maximum check game 2 dragon
[2:23:02] CiTRiNiTE: blue I mean..
[2:23:03] thatfriggindude: Boomkin just looks underwhelming in PVP...
[2:23:04] Wicks_TV: if anything losing helps prove Cdews point that itr didnt matter lol
[2:23:06] othernewname: 3Head
[2:23:08] The_Mail_Man__: so would go back again 2x 3-3 with decider on EU still if keeps flipping
[2:23:11] CiTRiNiTE: game 2 was blue, game 3 was red
[2:23:12] MorpheenBE: game 2 was blue
[2:23:13] Nox1o: game 2 should be blue
[2:23:18] happyheals: they also poke fun at each other and respect each other
[2:23:19] Powzoar: if anything Echo winning disproves his ping point, since they won with high ping lol
[2:23:24] Standy94: Does DH even notice ping? you just zoom around anyway
[2:23:33] keltrash_: get Musk to provide starlink
[2:23:37] CiTRiNiTE: Eiya Madge
[2:23:37] Nox1o: so we going blue again
[2:23:38] Eiya: MY BAD
[2:23:38] thisisthotcaller: where tf is this red / blue dragon youre talking about for the visually impared (i just cant see it :( )
[2:23:40] paul_muaddib4: @powzoar just means the gap is too big
[2:23:44] Rakinare: where are there dragons? wut?
[2:23:44] glow_xd: wont faster apm classes notice ping more?
[2:23:47] MorpheenBE: @Eiya Stare
[2:23:48] Esotraz: @eiya LIAR

[2:23:50] Pidly: Well we figured it out with science
[2:23:50] zenkodac: LUL
[2:23:51] alegpetrovich: @Standy94 its about kicking a boomie which is most important
[2:23:52] VeroxReact: how can you tell the ping by the color of the dragon?
[2:23:53] cajovysacok: echo team are dutch they will complain even about 10 ms  regardles
[2:23:53] othernewname: KEKW
[2:23:53] exomaths: i missed, what are dragons again
[2:23:53] Elbareth: I called her out don't worry @Maximum
[2:23:53] Eiya: OMGGGGGGG
[2:23:54] happyheals: earlier liquid won a high ping vs echo

[2:24:07] fujihd: clip react available?
[2:24:10] Nox1o: and max called us out for being wrong
[2:24:10] Eiya: I lied to your streamer, sorry guys.
[2:24:12] thundamental: lol is that the only way we know NA vs EU ping? Cdew dragon colour?:D
[2:24:13] menzlo: They should put a server in the Atlantic Ocean
[2:24:14] ZeronimoPewPew: cdew got us
[2:24:15] Hej_Benny: @Eiya I lie for fun aswell
[2:24:16] antris9: Stare
[2:24:19] Slapsstick: @Eiya MADGE
[2:24:19] xxMaverick: watching the AWC with chat hidden is a game changer

[2:24:20] Qubuuuu: Stare
[2:24:23] happyheals: Einah
[2:24:24] Zacaree55: @Maximum Need a Lord Mes to come out
[2:24:26] jesuslouise: eiya had eu ping when she said that.  that's all it was
[2:24:29] wowtrucker: @eiya lawl
[2:24:31] Eiya: @jesuslouise truth
[2:24:33] Madcatmk02: @Eiya it's okay all is forgiven for calling out TL for having the dogs out
[2:24:34] Pidly: Never admit anything. Just gas light
[2:24:35] Scoops__: monkaHmm
[2:24:38] Kawjiryu: Eiya just made it more fun for us is all
[2:24:38] Garzag_: @Eiya we will forgive you, this time Stare
[2:24:40] thisisthotcaller: OHHH are we literally talking about cdews dragon skin color?
[2:24:41] Esotraz: @eiya i will forgive u if u gift a sub :)
[2:24:46] FyrO: i wonder how optimal these pvp players are at doing damage in general, i know trill used to just DEMOLISH everyone in overall
[2:24:50] bublzzzz: @Maximum it would be trivial to set up virginia servers, and rate limit everyone to ~115 ping. Riot does this for LoL all the time.
[2:24:52] happyheals: you are good Eiya, the casting is awesome today
[2:24:53] FyrO: but its alot closer nowadays
[2:24:53] subbby: @Eiya np sjokz
[2:24:54] MiyaYuie: @eiya say blue or red. No need to know what it means
[2:24:57] glow_xd: wait is that ziqo talkin?
[2:24:58] CiTRiNiTE: he better not class swrap
[2:25:00] PPowzer74: cdew a real one for that LUL
[2:25:05] NotD4k: im curious why Sam is playing boomy, our spec is down bad for better defensives
[2:25:07] othernewname: why are players on bench?
[2:25:13] The_Mail_Man__: it would be good if the dragon colors were backwards for the whole tournament too
[2:25:13] xxxtheinternet42069xxx: #dragongate
[2:25:14] paul_muaddib4: state of wowesports
[2:25:16] gambleragain: Actually, Ziqo makes real sense. You can take away good maps and win because of pings.
[2:25:16] kaigasm: @glow_xd yes
[2:25:18] Garzag_: what is this classic wow guy ziqo doing talking about retail pvp? Kappa
[2:25:18] mgl_ftw: what color dragon now then xD
[2:25:19] Standy94: If Raiku has high ping does he miss zooms or something?
[2:25:22] Hammerferge: does Liquid have to lose two full series seeing as they haven't lost a series yet?
[2:25:25] bluenxd: it's on the broadcast overlay i thought @Maximum or i saw it somewhere on the stream at some point

[2:26:04] Zacaree55: Its a bo7 tho.
[2:26:06] RealApexPredator: upper bracket winner should start 1-0
[2:26:06] nohwonder: no bracket reset is actually the most brainlet thing ever

[2:26:21] FoxiekittenWoW: echo is the only team to take a game on na vs liquid tho

[2:54:24] Leqionennachweis: Its green
[2:54:27] Ruinx81: Kinda looks like FF
[2:54:28] Kakoee43: it starts in p2
[2:54:28] cheep_wow: 10 man raids are cringe
[2:54:35] regis_philbin_: enumeration POGGIES
[2:54:38] Omegabet__: AWC looks cool
[2:54:38] cajovysacok: cant play or watch these 10th peson from mars view  camera  games
[2:54:40] ahri_feet_connoisseur: looks like FF14
[2:54:45] LickMyReed: this line attack is reminding me of halondrus
[2:54:45] zerossussy: is this a boss that never been killed?
[2:54:51] Phantasiie: Similar mechanics to holondrous
[2:55:06] DeyPlays: What do you think of FFXIV raids?
[2:55:12] happyheals: 10 man raids were fun in like 10 man heroic days
[2:55:14] civiinn: do they have 6 of one class in the raid?
[2:55:19] regis_philbin_: greeding xdd
[2:55:23] Zlynnt: @civiinn yup
[2:55:24] isFeyz: I think telling people how healing works is important to understand from a WoW-player perspective @Maximum
[2:55:24] Leqionennachweis: If they fuck up mechanics, the boss gets stacks and does more damage (some oneshot)
[2:55:27] SoFisht: yes
[2:55:30] alexchopstix: @zerossussy correct, going for world first right now
[2:55:36] elsnickito: yes 6 mesmers for portals
[2:55:37] Sothis_best_girl: yes that's class icons
[2:55:38] lukkuz: What game is this
[2:55:41] woltk2024: ff raid comp is fucked
[2:55:43] Vexacia: environmental fields do things when you shoot types of attacks into them like projectiles make _something bolts
[2:55:45] enappl3: how do they see anything
[2:55:45] Zlynnt: @lukkuz guild Wars 2
[2:55:45] OperationSena: huge prize pool for season 4!
[2:55:46] The_Frix: the UI makes it so much better visually
[2:55:50] Standy94: They need more healers
[2:56:09] kursewalker: can we talk for a sec about how this dude is using his keyboard?
[2:56:12] kursewalker: like whut
[2:56:15] regis_philbin_: running 6 in a 10 man comp is crazy lmao
[2:56:28] Zlynnt: @kursewalker probably use to be an fps gamer
[2:56:36] iiamBaro: whats their best % ?
[2:56:43] The_Frix: the keyboard is pretty normal tho tf
[2:56:43] Knows_Too_Much: Magic: The Gathering boxes spotted
[2:56:44] Zlynnt: best % is like 2% nnow or something
[2:56:48] TheTrollgon: 3ish %
[2:56:52] iiamBaro: damn
[2:56:52] Dzor12: @regis_philbin_ Same thing would happen in WoW if they took away raid buffs and went down to 10 man, which is why it would be turbo lame
[2:57:10] sundance_joe: nerfs would require devs of which anet has few
[2:57:15] zerossussy: i hope blizzard never makes the same mistake again
[2:57:17] kursewalker: i have enver seen someone use a keyboard while it's at a 45degree angle
[2:57:18] Denekyy: i dont even know which circles heal/buff or which do damage
[2:57:27] MrChaCho: is it also at a point where if they nerf it's health a team is likely to walk in and one shot after nerf?
[2:57:33] Kakoee43: also virt is the best class that can do all their damage at range
[2:57:39] Zlynnt: @MrChaCho yeah kinda
[2:57:46] eggman_br: this looks cool actully
[2:58:04] Leqionennachweis: They just did the soak
[2:58:06] Daxter96: i like that it is 10man
[2:58:12] The_Frix: @kursewalker its pretty common tho, it makes it easier to use thumb for other keys
[2:58:16] Kakoee43: @Maximum 2 ppl need to soak the orbs
[2:58:17] Turkeypitz: color tone feels bad
[2:58:18] bonius_: is healing a thing is this game?
[2:58:28] Zlynnt: @bonius_ yes
[2:58:28] SoFisht: @bonius_ yes
[2:58:29] DeyPlays: This guy has quite the interesting setup
[2:58:30] BabyDunn: jesus this looks insane
[2:58:32] scassel85: I like that there isn't a 100 WA popups telling them what to do
[2:58:33] showerbees: Feels like they have far fewer buttons
[2:58:38] heat31: I will always love the clear defined circles
[2:58:40] zerossussy: this looks so entertaining
[2:58:42] zerossussy: just like RWF
[2:58:44] SoFisht: the circle with the line through it and the sun are both healers
[2:58:51] fainean: wasnt there something about dmg meters being banned?
[2:58:54] elsnickito: then do it?
[2:58:57] Theblueninjashen: @bonius_ they have a dpriest and and druid
[2:59:00] fainean: oh wrong game OMEGALUL
[2:59:01] Aqinog: @bonius_ yes but you dont actively choose who you heal, everything is smart healing
[2:59:07] NotD4k: OMEGALUL
[2:59:08] AnarchyMoose: then dont do it
[2:59:13] codydoubleu: think about it another time
[2:59:14] C4leb0rn: gw1 was pog, i was meh on gw2
[2:59:15] BloodsTTV: I miss gw2
[2:59:17] codydoubleu: maybe u will want to
[2:59:19] Glowey: definitely looks fun to watch someone else do it
[2:59:19] hutchie24: it feels like there is barely any dmg going out if you look at the frames
[2:59:21] taanzfour: damage taken doesnt seem to bea thing here unless u wipe or smtn
[2:59:26] madtrade2600: how many pulls ?
[2:59:26] MooHamOinkBeef: But then maybe do it after not doing it
[2:59:27] Keronas_: gw2 bit grindy tbh
[2:59:33] bonius_: Thanks, just didnt see much "raid damage"
[2:59:45] Leqionennachweis: @taanzfour the damage increases rapidly overtime
[2:59:47] sebby997: We gonna raid in the Riot MMO LUL
[2:59:48] SoFisht: @taanzfour this game leans heavily on one shot mechanics because there's a lot of active defensives
[2:59:49] The_Mail_Man__: nzoth puddles or
[2:59:51] Zlynnt: @taanzfour they are negating/avoiding a bit of damage
[2:59:52] baefIoyd: i wish more MMOs would run the hybrid tab target/action combat model like GW2
[3:00:01] KaisenSiru: CaitlynS CaitlynS CaitlynS
[3:00:03] regis_philbin_: that mech looks sick
[3:00:03] elsnickito: no they just dodge at last second
[3:00:18] Polowy: I will never complain about visual clarity in wow ever again lmao
[3:00:21] ZeronimoPewPew: looks like nzoth, beams puddles  and all
[3:00:21] regis_philbin_: monkaW
[3:00:30] MorpheenBE: PauseChamp 󠀀
[3:00:30] Leqionennachweis: 8 stacks monkaW
[3:00:37] BoodoM: what game is this? :o
[3:00:39] voxralol: this is the weirdest wow expac yet
[3:00:40] Zlynnt: one of them is using the fucking horse bow KEKW
[3:00:40] mikejonesrp: 3 mins left dont think they have damage
[3:00:42] regis_philbin_: this does look cool honestly
[3:00:42] Theblueninjashen: boss has 6 stack not support good pull but doable
[3:00:45] othernewname: they never seem to take any damage
[3:00:47] elsnickito: more stacks = more dmg
[3:00:50] TheTrollgon: +5% dmg
[3:00:54] SoFisht: yup
[3:00:55] Theblueninjashen: 1 stack = 5%
[3:00:57] Theblueninjashen: dmg
[3:01:00] CmeSugar: missing orb soaks?
[3:01:04] maxam_1: smolderon stacks
[3:01:04] Leqionennachweis: Very important for the last 10%
[3:01:05] Zlynnt: @othernewname a mix of damage negating and outright avoiding
[3:01:07] sundance_joe: @Polowy gw2 at least has the red lines to identify actual bad fire.
