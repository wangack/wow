[2:40:41] WiredMesh: @Phlanxx Depends on your priorities. Like library size and amount of data you want to keep around. SSDs indeed provide faster loading and less stutter in games that load on the go. That said, you can also have SSD+HDD+Software like PrimoCache and it can even be faster. Also for gaming drive it's good to format at larger cluster size. If you have more questions, whisper me. :)

In other words, someone who weighs 150 pounds (68 kg) would likely have to eat more than 6,800 cough drops containing 10 mg of menthol in a short period of time to risk the chance of a lethal overdose.
