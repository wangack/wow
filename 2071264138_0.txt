[0:38:26] SlithTheSivak: WoD or TbC? maybe cata...only xpacs that featured ogres

[0:52:20] databob1: @MrGM almost a year!? she's growing too fast
[0:52:21] Chesscape: pet battles
[0:52:57] SskygamesS: you doing also the BFA achievements?
[0:53:29] SskygamesS: i highly suggest to use the /attwq was pretty easy for me to track when world quest was connect to achieve
[0:53:54] ramzie0: Ok, for the completionists/collectors in chat, do you keep the Secrets of Azeroth clues after you do them? my bank is so full T.T
[0:54:35] SskygamesS: yeah is awesome to track stuff
[0:54:54] Elrathir: @SskygamesS damn, that's a good tip
[0:55:31] Shirey12: Glad to see you back on retail. best of luck on your 100% journey :)
[0:55:50] databob1: I loved BFA just not the last patch
[0:55:57] SskygamesS: Elrathir yeah since old expansions do release world quests with daily reset checking that tracker time by time helps a lot
[0:56:04] SskygamesS: dont*
[0:56:04] Carptwitch: BFA is better than Shadowlands and Dragonflight
[0:56:09] BBMezzy: Remove azerite and the entirety of the final patch and it'd be pretty good
[0:56:11] AlfredK: Really disliked everything to do with azerite lol
[0:56:50] Shirey12: 8.3 was so fun with Corruption gear. I actually only liked this patch of BFA because gameplay got fun
[0:56:53] DestinamueGaming: na i can't say shadowlands is better then  dragonflight
[0:56:56] Elrathir: I love Kul Tiras
[0:57:04] Larkaro: We didnt know how good we had it back before SL
[0:57:08] Carptwitch: BFA story was so much better than Dragonflight and Shadowlands
[0:57:28] ramzie0: Boralus was so pretty and well laid out.
[0:57:29] deindaddy22: from the setting and aesthetics i actually like shadownlands way more than dragonflight
[0:57:34] DestinamueGaming: @Carptwitch can't agree on that
[0:57:37] ramzie0: Zuldazar is so bad
[0:57:38] databob1: I play both and I really thought it was all fun
[0:57:41] Elrathir: the old god-y side of stormsong is my favorite
[0:57:54] SskygamesS: there is bird you need to grow up, i done that two rares with daily quests from that dragon
[0:57:56] SskygamesS: bird*
[0:57:58] Carptwitch: Blizzard is trying to become Disney and is ruining the story
[0:58:06] Elrathir: I really like Zandalar too to be fair
[0:58:08] bojackhorseman2004: I never thought the zones or asthetics of SL
[0:58:08] SskygamesS: let me check what achieve is
[0:58:13] bojackhorseman2004: but it had so many other problems
[0:58:24] DestinamueGaming: i really liked dragonflight
[0:58:28] bojackhorseman2004: was bad*
[0:58:32] AlfredK: I think Ardenweald is probably the best looking zone they have ever made but the expansion was awful
[0:58:34] apollymae: I like the song for jaina in BFA
[0:58:43] bojackhorseman2004: Dragonflight has to many dragons
[0:58:57] Elrathir: Rastakhan and Talanji were really cool characters imo
[0:59:04] bojackhorseman2004: I liked the kyrian area, and the first SL raid was a blast
[0:59:06] databob1: how is blizzard trying to be disney and why would that be bad?
[0:59:10] ImperfectDark: Ardenweald was frickin beautiful
[0:59:13] Lausten: On top of the hut
[0:59:14] AlfredK: Yea but it was like a more lame version of Ardenweald lol
[0:59:16] Lausten: Left side
[0:59:25] Lausten: Up
[0:59:29] SskygamesS: if you full grow pterrordax, you eventually get that last two rares you need for achieve - pterrordax achieve is: How to Ptrain Your pterrordax
[0:59:31] Shirey12: I like dragonflight's systems a ton. I hope they brush up on public crafting orders. You shouldn't be allowed to post some or none of the materials for a crafting order.
[0:59:32] ramzie0: on top of that overhang
[0:59:38] Carptwitch: WoD had better story than any newer expansion
[0:59:45] DestinamueGaming: i liked the emerialed dream
[1:00:00] DestinamueGaming: wod was bad
[1:00:16] bojackhorseman2004: WoD the "oh shit ur in the past now" had a better story?
[1:00:17] Carptwitch: WoD had bad gameplay but amazing story
[1:00:28] SskygamesS: not sure if is only horde
[1:00:33] Shirey12: I love WoD's raids and I miss Multistrike as a stat.
[1:00:44] Lausten: @SskygamesS Its horde, and also if it doesnt bug out, mines been bugged for years and GMs auto responsees are the worst.. NotLikeThis
[1:00:45] databob1: don't talk bad about my death loa
[1:00:57] SskygamesS: Lausten gotcha
[1:00:57] DestinamueGaming: wow was bad imo
[1:01:06] Carptwitch: WoD failed because they never got to finish the expansion to many scapped projects
[1:01:09] DestinamueGaming: wod*
[1:01:15] bojackhorseman2004: I feel like blizzard is so against player housing becuse they think thats what the garrisons where...
[1:01:39] bojackhorseman2004: Well, against putting resources into making playerhousing
[1:01:50] bojackhorseman2004: cuz they havent in 20 years of the game being a thing
[1:01:56] DestinamueGaming: i hated cata the most
[1:02:08] Shirey12: @DestinamueGaming same
[1:02:28] Carptwitch: Im not gonna play Cata Classic thats for sure
[1:02:38] physalis4: I think it will be the least popular
[1:02:40] Lausten: They are not against player housing, but the problem is taht wow aint build for you to place things in the world, its rarely done through questing via phasing, but they'd need to build it for chairs, benches, curtains etc if they decide to do it and damn thats a big task
[1:02:57] DestinamueGaming: i feel like from a stand point cata was a shit show
[1:03:13] ratgefingah: g'day goodsir
[1:03:22] Shirey12: 2019 was regular classic. They're wrong.
[1:03:50] bojackhorseman2004: I never raided in cata and actually might give it a proper try, firelands raid looks good
[1:04:00] Elrathir: I feel like they're only doing Cata to get to MoP. In any case it feels like a mistake not to keep Wrath servers
[1:04:03] ramzie0: cata classic comes out this year, so that'd be 14 years between cata and cata classic
[1:04:15] bojackhorseman2004: its more of a, experiencing the old raids as "current content"
[1:04:20] AlfredK: I thought cata was amazing at the time.
[1:04:27] bojackhorseman2004: which i like
[1:04:48] Carptwitch: my feeling is that we have just had 2 pointless filler expansions Shadowlands and Dragonflight and they need to prove something to the playerbase to get players back
[1:05:06] bojackhorseman2004: Maybe they wanna "push" people into cata, and then they will re re release wrath again
[1:05:10] Carptwitch: 100%
[1:05:11] ratgefingah: cant wait to play the best endboss fight ever again, deathwing Kappa
[1:05:17] Shirey12: '04 Vanilla '07 TBC, '08-Wrath, '10 Cata.
[1:05:18] Lausten: Filler, for what exactly? @Carptwitch
[1:05:40] Larkaro: Is it players leaving the game or people just not having time to play
[1:05:48] kaijoe_: I mean, we would previously have droughts way worse than this
[1:05:55] plopptart: yup
[1:05:57] Chesscape: hard to get hyped when we don't know anything at all
[1:05:58] physalis4: I think it's setting ppl up for disappointment
[1:05:59] Elrathir: They could at least release a patch trailer
[1:06:10] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:06:13] Lausten: cant do a 8 week patch cadance, and then go completely silent like now
[1:06:15] ratgefingah: or give us a date
[1:06:21] bojackhorseman2004: Blizzard cant handle my imagination, so ofc its gonna be a dissepointment
[1:06:23] maros_petrus: @Larkaro usually it's not about having time to play, it's about not making it enough of a priority to make time for it
[1:06:26] ratgefingah: my moneys on after hs event
[1:06:34] Shirey12: I think what people are tired of is knowing new expacs always bring 4 Zones, 8 Dungeons, and 1-3 raids.
[1:06:41] StreamElements: UNUSED Classic WoW Maps that Season of Discovery Could Utilise - https://youtu.be/x5Whfuumtj0
[1:06:49] cityguard_eu: when is the heartstone event
[1:06:57] ratgefingah: til 22nd
[1:06:58] DestinamueGaming: i can't call df bad

[1:07:13] cityguard_eu: i think the patch will be after
[1:07:31] SskygamesS: for sure us NA going test the patch before EU LUL
[1:07:32] Larkaro: I feel like as players we tend to over excite ourselves for new content and then get annoyed when its not what we want
[1:07:33] Carptwitch: @Lausten its a filler because the story is irrelavant to the main story
[1:07:33] ratgefingah: nah i mistook
[1:07:46] SlithTheSivak: If hearthstone starts on monday at 10, then its data would have to be loaded the tuesday before
[1:08:00] bojackhorseman2004: Depends how big it is, if it is somthin you do for 2 days they can launch it whenever
[1:08:09] funviking99: you are right the hype is gone for me
[1:08:09] SskygamesS: let MDI finish first LUL

[1:08:13] funviking99: at least
[1:08:33] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:08:51] cityguard_eu: i want my motobike
[1:09:01] SlithTheSivak: or even new hero talents to pour over
[1:09:14] SlithTheSivak: 36
[1:09:15] Shirey12: I think blizzard should go back to more than the standard 8 dungeons and an extra "Mega" dungeons. Bring a patch that brings 2 more into the pool. Also I'd love them to break the 3 raids an expac cycle. Bring a 4th Raid.
[1:09:17] mrsrockguru: afternon @MrGM and chat
[1:09:34] bojackhorseman2004: Well, we just got new SoD season. From blizzards pov we are eating well and getting content on a regular pace
[1:10:03] SlithTheSivak: theyve shown w the discipline talents that they are absolutely willing to do a redesign, but that will only happen if we get them early enough to give feedback
[1:10:10] dright424: we have been getting hero talents, but they are kinda boring without being able to look at all of them
[1:10:20] BBMezzy: There should be at least 1 new dungeon per major patch
[1:10:28] Shirey12: I love watching RWF, Maximum made a good point on it and not having a 4th hurts.
[1:10:34] bojackhorseman2004: They confirmed the orace hero talent is getting reworked
[1:10:52] SskygamesS: for sure they are not giving us 500k gold Kappa
[1:10:59] bojackhorseman2004: Tbh, i want smaller more frequent raids. 3-6 boss raids be 100% great for me
[1:11:19] Shirey12: TBC
[1:11:30] bojackhorseman2004: well, they where single bosses
[1:11:39] Shirey12: Not counting 1 boss raids.
[1:11:45] Lausten: ZG too
[1:11:52] Shirey12: 5 wrath raids had 1 boss raids.
[1:12:36] bojackhorseman2004: Depends what they do for S4, they are not calling it fated anymore.
[1:12:47] bojackhorseman2004: I would love all the DF dungeons
[1:12:49] physalis4: There are some DF dungeons that are miserable in M+
[1:12:51] bojackhorseman2004: who are these people?
[1:13:01] Larkaro: If so, I do not look forward to season 4
[1:13:13] KaisenSiru: Season 4 Pog
[1:13:18] bojackhorseman2004: I feel like 4-6 months with rubby, algathar etc etc was not enough
[1:13:19] JMT_101: are people on twitter really people tho?
[1:13:27] bojackhorseman2004: and they been balanced
[1:13:51] physalis4: Stuff wouldn't get changed if it wasn't for social media
[1:13:57] Larkaro: At the moment I feel like I could take a break from wow until acc wide collection
[1:14:05] databob1: is this the raid?
[1:14:16] SskygamesS: we didnt even got dungeon poll like shadowlands
[1:14:17] SlithTheSivak: supreme confidence or arrogance
[1:14:20] databob1: oh ok
[1:14:32] Robodope: oh I'm skipping season 4 for sure. gonna catch up on other games.
[1:15:06] SskygamesS: season 4 will be 2 weeks after 10.2.6 is my bet
[1:15:10] bojackhorseman2004: I mean, the dark heart patch post S4 is gonna be amazing for us lore nerds
[1:15:11] Shirey12: @Robodope bro same I've been on LE since I got 3.2k I.O this season
[1:15:13] Carptwitch: ive honestly lost hope with the blizzard story team... everything is getting to woke
[1:15:17] bojackhorseman2004: so there is still plenty fun stuff to come
[1:15:20] SlithTheSivak: avatars been solid
[1:15:22] Layliah79: Watched some of  it last night - it's really good.
[1:15:24] mrsrockguru: 10.2.6 sometime after 18th march, which is the end of the hearthstone event
[1:15:32] KaisenSiru: HUH
[1:15:35] physalis4: lol get out
[1:15:38] SlithTheSivak: Family!
[1:15:41] Demeternoth: You can just go back to sleep then XD
[1:15:42] Larkaro: Its not good
[1:15:43] cityguard_eu: what becuase of the lesbians and gays
[1:15:43] bojackhorseman2004: Idk what "woke" means, sounds like a buzz word people throw around
[1:15:45] Calicice12: bggCorn finameNom
[1:15:47] physalis4: wahhhh things are woke boooo hoooo
[1:15:49] Lausten: @Carptwitch Oh no, feelings.. Juck
[1:15:55] Engram08: I watched the first episode and I loved it
[1:15:57] databob1: too woke? better go take a nap
[1:16:07] Shirey12: II don't think it's woke at all.
[1:16:09] SlithTheSivak: "wheres the war in my warcraft soup?!"
[1:16:14] Elrathir: @databob1 LUL
[1:16:20] ratgefingah: "the evil cancel culture! back then there was still racism in my games!" Kappa
[1:16:49] SlithTheSivak: historically wow is pretty racist...
[1:17:02] bojackhorseman2004: Anduin is struggeling with mental health issues, way to woke Kappa
[1:17:06] OpiumHC: go woke, go broke and yet they have fired people, figure out why
[1:17:20] Larkaro: I love a drive-by hot take
[1:17:47] Shirey12: @OpiumHC this post deserves mod priveleges
[1:18:00] SlithTheSivak: @OpiumHC they get bought for the largest aquisitions cost in the history of software, and ur gonna say they went broke?!
[1:18:04] Lausten: PansexualPride
[1:18:14] Robodope: i heard theres pronouns in the game now. very upsetting.
[1:18:27] Robodope: (yes)
[1:18:29] Shirey12: @Robodope where?
[1:18:30] cityguard_eu: where
[1:18:31] OpiumHC: Vice went full woke and today they shut it down, figure it why
[1:18:58] ImperfectDark: I got a letter from HMRC with NOT KNOWN Robert so i think those are my pronouns
[1:18:59] SlithTheSivak: opiums huffing his own supply
[1:19:12] databob1: how dare a video game talk about things I have opinions about and not agree with me. I MAY HAVE TO THINK!!!!
[1:19:13] OpiumHC: check the news
[1:19:19] ratgefingah: everyones watching our congress' livestream today. they are legalizing weed in Germany LUL
[1:19:35] SlithTheSivak: brb moving to germany
[1:19:36] cityguard_eu: really!
[1:19:38] ratgefingah: ye its been in talk for a long time
[1:19:39] mrsrockguru: yep with restictions
[1:19:43] Shirey12: @MrGM Dan, what's your opinion on Dark Ranger since you play Hunter?
[1:19:51] ramzie0: POG for Germany!
[1:20:08] SlithTheSivak: constitution of the us is printed on hemp! foundation of america is WEED
[1:20:14] bojackhorseman2004: My country banned furry suits from university graduation grounds
[1:20:15] bojackhorseman2004: progress
[1:20:17] cityguard_eu: yeah wine and vodka and smoking and vaping do more damage than weed
[1:20:37] bozzzna: Germany went full woke and today they legalized weed, figure it why
[1:20:41] cityguard_eu: in moderation
[1:20:49] ramzie0: Vaping is like 95% less harmful than smoking
[1:21:03] SlithTheSivak: Eh, i live in a legal state, i get prescriptions for my joints, so im allowed to at work, smoke weed
[1:21:04] fumennen: https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/hero-talents#revealed-hero-talent-trees @MrGM the hero talent trees
[1:21:05] LuiBMHunter: If i'm drunk - there's no way I'm going to work - duh!
[1:21:21] Shirey12: I am really hoping Soul Harvester for Warlock sets me up for success for Affliction come next expac. I've talked to Kalamazi and Aff needs reworked. It's my favorite spec and its bad in Dragonflight.
[1:21:38] SlithTheSivak: in the us, all states that legalized it saw sharp drops in drunk driving, and adolescent use
[1:21:38] mrsrockguru: Unless you smoke weed with tobacco.
[1:21:40] bojackhorseman2004: California had an "epedemtic" of illegal weed growing
[1:21:47] bojackhorseman2004: after it got legalised
[1:22:01] LuiBMHunter: can't believe they are giving hunters another skill to find a button for!
[1:22:30] bojackhorseman2004: Wailing arrow silenced
[1:22:32] bojackhorseman2004: this dosnt
[1:22:33] Lausten: You got Black Arrow as a Hunter I believe
[1:22:46] Lausten: Or is that Wailing?
[1:22:50] dright424: wailing arrow is already a hunter talent
[1:24:15] Shirey12: BM AoE gonna go brrrr
[1:24:18] Lausten: Problems with these is it ads percentage or cooldowns to things already in the talent trees, so the balance design becomes 2 things instead of 1, it will take "double" the dev time to figure out how to balance the things
[1:24:25] bojackhorseman2004: I feel like we are gonna be spamming aimed shots xD
[1:24:32] LuiBMHunter: kinda boring
[1:24:33] BBMezzy: Underwhelming for BM
[1:24:40] ratgefingah: I wanna see packleader
[1:24:43] dright424: people wanted it to be mm/surv
[1:24:43] Shirey12: Wowhead comments don't like it because of the aimed shot charges
[1:24:49] BBMezzy: Big difference between aimed shot and barbed shot reset
[1:24:50] LuiBMHunter: no massive ott hit me button
[1:24:56] mrsrockguru: just checked the marksman talents no black arrow, only wailing arrow in the listing
[1:25:03] ratgefingah: the exhilleration node needs to be in the other hunter tree too
[1:25:12] bojackhorseman2004: I think its fine, wanna see how much shadowdmg we do
[1:25:15] bojackhorseman2004: would love to be tankier
[1:25:17] ratgefingah: or else dark ranger is mandatory for m+
[1:25:32] BBMezzy: What people liked about the original black arrow was the free explosive shot procs with ranged SV
[1:25:54] Shirey12: Cata survival vibes @BBMezzy
[1:26:01] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[1:26:17] NeeK_23: afternoon
[1:26:32] mrsrockguru: yeah, they focus on one talent
[1:26:32] Lausten: Its pointless! Exactly. its just bloat
[1:26:44] Lausten: Bloat bloat bloat, they could just balance the original talents
[1:26:51] NeeK_23: easier to tune I guess
[1:26:59] dright424: you can collapse it at max
[1:27:03] fumennen: there are 3 new trees
[1:27:11] bojackhorseman2004: cuz you need to unlock somthing while leveling
[1:27:21] bojackhorseman2004: and getting to pick more options is harder to balance
[1:27:31] dright424: yeah they showed it collapsing to just the choice nodes
[1:27:32] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:27:34] NeeK_23: one talent as a box feature looks sparce. I guess they want to make it look substantial
[1:27:41] bojackhorseman2004: Ability skins is somthing we been asking forever
[1:27:52] deindaddy22: thats what everyone wanted from those :D
[1:27:54] Shirey12: Affliction needs help the most. Maybe i'm biased because I main lock. But Malefic rapture requires siphon life for the extra dot. I hope to see a rework.
[1:27:58] bojackhorseman2004: bring back glyphs just modernised
[1:28:05] SlithTheSivak: pretty sure thats what people hoped hero talents were
[1:28:10] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:28:12] Lausten: They are doing it again, making another system to develop and it will just make the balancing of the classes harder without players ever thinking about it cause its 3 focus from a talent thats "mandatory" as you can not pick.. Just give the base ability 3 more focus..
[1:28:23] NeeK_23: some animations are changing, like that warrior one shown in blizzcon and the frostfire one
[1:28:29] bojackhorseman2004: Achivement "Fire Aimed shot 100 000 times" unlock darkned aimed shot
[1:28:32] MogSnap: nuoberon finall dropped the bow! only need the dagger off fystia for 100% emerald dream now
[1:28:32] physalis4: They're redoing the Priest talents and I thought they were cool af
[1:28:40] SlithTheSivak: I want to be a frost mage that uses time magic, sand for slows instead of frost
[1:29:07] NeeK_23: @SlithTheSivak evoker then
[1:29:11] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[1:29:15] Shirey12: It was morgan yeah
[1:29:37] SlithTheSivak: @NeeK_23 our blue magic is still cold for slows ;p
[1:30:04] SlithTheSivak: im not as excited as Morgan
[1:30:18] NeeK_23: frostfire is gonna look so good
[1:30:28] bojackhorseman2004: instead of adding 200 mounts every expansion, add like 5 ability skins for each class
[1:30:36] Shirey12: Soul Harvester better be able to like me multi drain soul for shard gen. Now that would be sick.
[1:31:05] NeeK_23: I want 200 mounts though
[1:31:49] NeeK_23: how do we know they wont have that? where has that been said?
[1:32:01] Shirey12: More theme less meme :D
[1:32:26] NeeK_23: i dont read that have not having any effects
[1:32:42] NeeK_23: we've literally only seen that warrior
[1:32:56] bojackhorseman2004: the main ability of warrior isnt confirmed to change either, thunderclap and the stun is what was shown
[1:33:00] Shirey12: @NeeK_23 true.
[1:33:03] bojackhorseman2004: becuse the abilities change
[1:33:37] BBMezzy: It's all up to Blizzard to manage expectations, something they could so some improving on
[1:33:42] SlithTheSivak: evokers still have 0 glyphs
[1:33:59] NeeK_23: I think people are getting all worked up on assumptions based on things we've never seen. I get people upset at certain powers but this isnt the same issue
[1:34:06] bojackhorseman2004: Remember we are keeping this for the next 3 expansions, so they might not wanna do to crazy of things
[1:34:12] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak That could be a positive though, maybe they are working on an entire new system
[1:34:19] Shirey12: I heard a rumor that Paladins will be able to glyph their holy abilities to silver instead of gold?
[1:35:15] NeeK_23: Evokers might not have glyphs but tbh apart from druids when was the last class to get any glyphs, its just not a thing anymore and more barbershop customisation is the path forward
[1:35:46] SlithTheSivak: @Lausten ive thought of that, the druid changes to the barber shop are sorta indicating an overhaul of the cosmetic system
[1:35:47] Lausten: @NeeK_23 +1 Fuck Glyphs, Barbrer Shop is the way forward
[1:35:56] NeeK_23: even warlocks are collectable tomes rather than glyphs
[1:36:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:36:20] NeeK_23: they just retro made old glyphs into tomes
[1:36:37] Lausten: Hunters Next? Stable like Wardrobe for skins 👍
[1:37:24] Layliah79: We need new skins for Druid trees esp since they will be used with the new trees in the next xpac.
[1:37:45] SlithTheSivak: good source of tax revenue
[1:37:47] BBMezzy: I imagine there are more pressing matters taking up the focus
[1:37:51] Thoreya: they need to make that shit recreationally legal in florida
[1:38:05] Thoreya: just medical
[1:38:11] Robodope: legal weed is on the ballot this year in florida
[1:38:17] Shirey12: @Thoreya it's not in Indiana either. I don't use it but don't see why not
[1:38:19] NeeK_23: dont want to get all political but Liz Truss was at a Trump rally spouting conspiracy theories. Looks like we dodged a bullet with her not being PM LuL
[1:38:46] MogSnap: its not possible yet is it?
[1:38:47] physalis4: no rewards for it
[1:38:48] ramzie0: I havent even started the archives yet
[1:38:48] BBMezzy: I've completed it
[1:38:53] NeeK_23: I'm close, should be next daily quest reset
[1:38:57] Lausten: Just make any drugs legal, and shuffle the money used to hunt drug sale towards helping people stop using..
[1:39:05] Layliah79: one of them requires several weeks of the world quests
[1:39:07] Oshogun: nothing exciting . doing that onece a week and the daily if i remember
[1:39:17] BBMezzy: Yea completed it on the 14th
[1:39:25] ramzie0: @MrGM Have you seen Krowli's Achievement Filter? I love it.
[1:39:35] Septikknissen: You have to do each of the world quest 3 times I think
[1:39:40] NeeK_23: wowhead has a script that shows you progress on the world quest achieve
[1:39:43] Layliah79: think that one is RNG - i ahve that one done.
[1:39:45] Lausten: @ramzie0 Yeah thats a very good one
[1:40:02] ramzie0: It adds tons of filters for the achievements pane
[1:40:13] Lausten: Another example of how Blizzaards UI sucks LUL
[1:40:22] BBMezzy: @Septikknissen No, you just have to complete 1 out of the 6 three times to get the achievement
[1:40:42] Layliah79: You pet battle escapades yesterday have now got me doing the pet battler achievements in ZCaverns.
[1:40:45] Layliah79: *your
[1:40:59] Shirey12: What's everyone's favorite removed spell? Mine is Hellfire for Warlock. would love to see it for a Hero Talent. (Diabolist).
[1:41:00] Lausten: Disable those right away
[1:41:07] Layliah79: what is that addon?
[1:41:17] Lausten: You can disable the pop up notifications in the options @MrGM
[1:41:29] NeeK_23: I hated that addon. I miss overachiever, but the guy stopped updating it
[1:41:31] Big_Rum: Hello There!
[1:41:50] Layliah79: what is it?
[1:41:54] BBMezzy: That seems very overwhelming
[1:42:16] ramzie0: @Layliah79 Krowli's Achievement Filter
[1:42:19] RAF_Sean: Installed new nvidia drivers and it bricked an HDMI port. Panic set in but after a re-install it's working.\
[1:42:27] NeeK_23: bring back this game and the lines one from Nazjatar
[1:42:30] Layliah79: i loved the shell game!
[1:42:39] Shirey12: "A Turtle Made it to the Water!"
[1:42:46] RAF_Sean: Yeah one of my ports just stopped working
[1:42:50] RAF_Sean: All good now though
[1:42:53] RAF_Sean: Only minor cursing
[1:43:00] apollymae: had to do teh line game in Zcaverns to get a chest

[1:45:17] NeeK_23: i usually wait a week first
[1:45:28] Dazdru: Hey Man, how you doing?
[1:45:36] Lausten: I'll call myself an update junkie, I ALWAYS read patch notes..
[1:45:36] Layliah79: same - multiple times a day
[1:45:38] mikalelele13: what’s your achievement points
[1:46:16] mikalelele13: gg 31k goodluck, got a long way to go boi
[1:46:23] NeeK_23: I wish I had the skill to make addons
[1:46:37] RAF_Sean: Man I miss emissarys
[1:46:44] Layliah79: i have 38,825 achievement points. missing so much in the PVP section.
[1:47:07] NeeK_23: thats me and PvP.
[1:47:12] Layliah79: you need to start a good collection first! it's addicting once you start
[1:47:17] Davinah_00: i just have never gotten into the pet battles
[1:47:44] NeeK_23: chat is full of secret pet battlers, we are the silent majority
[1:47:45] Layliah79: achievements started in Wrath, right?
[1:48:08] LuiBMHunter: why does my feral have to be a cat - I want to be a dog!

[1:48:17] BBMezzy: Out of the 143 achievements I'm still missing, 85 are PvP achievements.. they are just terrible to do
[1:48:32] NeeK_23: @LuiBMHunter race change to worgen and be both
[1:48:48] LuiBMHunter: ewww
[1:48:48] Layliah79: i made sure to do the island pvp before BFA ended just for that reason
[1:48:57] Layliah79: however, i'm lacking in PVP pet battle achievments.
[1:49:21] MogSnap: for me, pvp and pet battle achieves dont exist until i have literally everything else
[1:49:22] NeeK_23: can you win trade pvp islands or is that bannable?
[1:49:33] databob1: I really miss the turtle minigames
[1:49:44] SlithTheSivak: @MrGM do u know much about the concept of the "third place"?
[1:49:47] Lausten: You can, and yeah itmay be bannable, but theres no rankings so I doubt it
[1:49:49] Layliah79: prob find people on the achievement discord for things like that!
[1:49:59] Davinah_00: i think for island pvp you need 3 people
[1:50:17] SlithTheSivak: its like the role pubs in britain used to fill, local public gathering spaces...WoW needs to add more third places
[1:50:22] NeeK_23: yeah with no current rankings I wasnt sure if its against ToS.
[1:51:20] Lausten: A third place is a familiar public spot where you regularly connect with others known and unknown, over a shared interest or activity
[1:51:41] StreamElements: UNUSED Classic WoW Maps that Season of Discovery Could Utilise - https://youtu.be/x5Whfuumtj0
[1:51:51] Big_Rum: Any Plans this weekend?
[1:51:57] mikalelele13: you have how many rep completed?
[1:52:30] Big_Rum: Whats the photo shoot for?
[1:52:39] Lausten: @NeeK_23 I know of people who have done it and havent been banned if that helps, as long as the 3 of you trading doesnt tell I doubt anyone will ever know
[1:52:52] SlithTheSivak: if u dont cry during Iron Claw u wont cry during anything in wow
[1:53:00] Big_Rum: Its in Perth yeah?
[1:53:33] NeeK_23: still need to fill to pop the queue
[1:53:51] Davinah_00: you can do solo island
[1:54:11] Chesscape: for heroic warfront you still need group
[1:54:25] Big_Rum: I mean the whole family basically tragically dies so yeah
[1:54:31] NeeK_23: I'd love to do warfronts again, Im not sure how youd be able to solo. maybe with follower dungeon tech
[1:54:43] Big_Rum: Like you didnt know
[1:54:55] SlithTheSivak: it was fairly tragic, i know the exact line in the movie that will probably break you
[1:54:57] KaisenSiru: anniesRIP
[1:55:01] Big_Rum: The von eriks are legendary
[1:55:04] NeeK_23: guess youre weekend is free again xD
[1:55:13] databob1: wow don't burry the lead or anything
[1:55:27] thunduz: yeah I know absolutely nothing about the real life story of iron claw so that’s that
[1:55:27] NeeK_23: btw Darth Vader is Luke's Dad
[1:55:46] ratgefingah: I just saw my first scarab lord ever in retail
[1:56:09] ratgefingah: wild
[1:56:10] FrostBeered: arthas is the lich king
[1:56:37] NeeK_23: it'd be cool to know how many retail scarab lords are active.
[1:56:42] ratgefingah: lmao
[1:56:45] Layliah79: he was the best part KEKW
[1:56:50] databob1: very unfair
[1:56:51] thunduz: saw that too and completely agree
[1:57:00] KaisenSiru: anniesGasp anniesGasp anniesGasp
[1:57:12] DevoidX: oot ti deyojne i
[1:57:16] NeeK_23: Marvel burnout most likely
[1:57:16] SlithTheSivak: dark cgi fest
[1:57:20] MogSnap: definitely super hero fatigue
[1:57:20] databob1: he sucks as a person but he was a good Kang
[1:57:23] midiMitch: just marvel exhaustion
[1:57:28] FrostBeered: they're also not making the silver surfer female now, they're finally following the comics
[1:57:33] dright424: superheros are just getting boring
[1:57:42] Layliah79: his acting was good in the movies. think they are just looking for an easy blame
[1:57:48] thunduz: I think it’s because Marvel failed to connect any of the last phase that caused people to wonder why should they care
[1:58:01] NeeK_23: oh know, that section of the internet just made 10,00 rage videos hearing that
[1:58:06] Layliah79: Majors was in Loki S2 - yet that did well
[1:58:10] thunduz: I bet it’s just trolling of “marvel is woke now”
[1:58:13] SlithTheSivak: found an article from gamerant from nov 23 that mentions it
[1:58:17] databob1: I heard that too but I'll beleave it when I see it
[1:58:28] Jeanssi: @NeeK_23 in Dataforazeroth 0,0313% of players have the title, so 3 in ten thousand
[1:58:37] SlithTheSivak: someone even rumored anya taylor joy as silver surfer apparently
[1:58:37] Layliah79: I liked The Marvels too
[1:58:40] RosieSeren: I think its natural for films to have phases, westerns used to be all the rage. I think just need to dial back the quanitiy of superhero movies and maybe try differenct approaches
[1:58:57] Layliah79: loved the kitten scenes
[1:59:11] NeeK_23: did you seen the Civil War trailer? (not marvel one)
[1:59:31] physalis4: I think Disney got greedy and oversaturated us with too much Marvel content
[1:59:34] ramzie0: Sony has to keep making spider man movies to keep the rights
[1:59:41] thunduz: Doesn’t help that general public doesn’t know the difference between Sony Marvel and Marvel MCU
[1:59:42] SlithTheSivak: Madam Web was seriously terrible. bad acting by everyone except uncle ben
[1:59:50] NeeK_23: Alex Garland who made 28days later is directing
[1:59:50] physalis4: Disney burnt their customers out
[1:59:58] thunduz: saw that!
[2:00:31] RosieSeren: biggest thing for me is I feel film making itself has gotten worse, as in lighting, sound and editing, so even good films are done a dis service
[2:00:36] ramzie0: They assumed that because the Tom Holland movies were MCU, that madam web would be
[2:00:36] SlithTheSivak: wasnt goop braggin that she didnt even remember what movies she was in...
[2:00:37] thunduz: don’t waste your time
[2:00:47] physalis4: That guy thought it was a masterpiece

[2:01:14] BBMezzy: The thing is, if all the Marvel D+ stuff was good then I'd have been fine with it. The problem is that the quality of a good chunk was just not good
[2:01:25] NeeK_23: nope
[2:01:29] Lausten: Mentioning Oppenheimer. That movie is a masterpiece!
[2:01:45] KaisenSiru: Dune 2 brought back cinematography
[2:02:19] thunduz: again shows that had like no impact on the overall MCU sadly
[2:02:27] NeeK_23: phase 4 just feels directionless. was hoping Kang would focus phas5 but if they have to rewrite alot of it, i fear for it
[2:02:28] thunduz: Moon Knight was dope
[2:02:34] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:02:45] RosieSeren: oppenheimer is both a long and short film, you get so caught up in it the time just goes so quick xD
[2:02:47] Lausten: I gave up after Loki season 1
[2:02:50] Big_Rum: 10 rings was the best Marvel film of the moidern phase IMO
[2:02:51] physalis4: Moon Knight was so cool
[2:03:15] dright424: Moonknight and Loki are the two actaully good shows
[2:03:35] RosieSeren: I think mood knight had its flaws but I loved its creativity
[2:03:54] NeeK_23: I didnt finish Moonknight, wasnt feeling it tbh. Last one I liked was Ms Marvel
[2:04:19] RosieSeren: might have to steal that now xD
[2:04:30] thunduz: mrgmHehe terrible but also clever
[2:04:46] Hotstitute: ok hear me out...
[2:04:48] SlithTheSivak: that it happens that often that u have a cheeky name should have u reconsidering ur drinking habits!
[2:05:00] thunduz: shots are the danger zone
[2:05:02] Hotstitute: Is Kaz'al'gar linked to undermine/kezan.. 11.1? :O
[2:05:14] thunduz: or the DANger zone one might say
[2:05:41] SlithTheSivak: stick to pints, no liquor...and lite beer
[2:06:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:06:11] Hotstitute: isnt DF> BFA account wide with rep next expansion?
[2:06:11] SlithTheSivak: it fills u up so u dont even want to drink at all ;p
[2:06:15] databob1: Falcon and the winter solderer would have been better if they weren't so focused on making Falcon cap without the decades of  back story that led upto it in the comics. and even in the comics Falcon was a solid character that didn't need someone elses legacy to validate him.
[2:06:31] ramzie0: I get Old Fashioned's because it's just a glass of whiskey and you sip on it instead of doing shots
[2:06:40] NeeK_23: one day stockholm sydrome will kick in and you'll be excited for pet battles LuL
[2:07:05] Hotstitute: my dad got tickets to Elimination chamber, and is taunting me
[2:07:20] thunduz: he wasn’t lol. that’s playful banter
[2:07:32] Hotstitute: im not in my home town :(
[2:07:34] RosieSeren: I don't think so, anthony mackie is very funny and is always teasing the other cast

[2:09:46] SlithTheSivak: Isaiah Bradley
[2:10:02] bojackhorseman2004: to me its not about "minoroty" whatever, its just bad acting and story. Like boring
[2:10:46] KaisenSiru: devoLEAVE

[2:11:28] SNAKEBOMBS22: YES!
[2:11:28] thunduz: I think it is for a good amount yep
[2:11:28] BiPressed: very true
[2:11:30] Zuldak: they are prob ex players
[2:11:32] SlithTheSivak: Bellular apparently said he doesn't play, no time
[2:11:39] RosieSeren: I don't understand why, but I do feel like its become popular to be a hater now, just on anything in general
[2:11:40] Demeternoth: confirmation bias
[2:11:46] SNAKEBOMBS22: yup
[2:11:51] michaelmm: There's definitely a bunch of ex  wow players who seem to just want to dunk on the game on every opportunity.
[2:11:53] RAF_Sean: I love the game and play 16 hours a day
[2:11:58] FrostBeered: like asmondgold
[2:12:02] RAF_Sean: but still don't have any achievements lol
[2:12:06] Zuldak: its like people binge hate watching
[2:12:19] thunduz: I found myself being one of those gamers with Fortnite and I regret it lol. said Fortnite was terrible never playing it. love me some Fortnite now
[2:12:19] dright424: ex-hardcore wow players love to hate WoW
[2:12:27] MogSnap: its asmons job to shit on the game
[2:12:38] michaelmm: Asmon says he still plays it - he just doesn't cover much in his stream any more.
[2:12:46] BiPressed: asmon is critical of the game. theres a difference
[2:12:48] thunduz: I done messed up
[2:12:55] NeeK_23: I want to play more, but I tend to be involved in the game without playing the game these days
[2:13:00] RosieSeren: i've never played fornite, is it really that good or is a bit big conspiracy lol xD
[2:13:27] thunduz: No Build is where it’s at
[2:14:06] thunduz: that was a solid event!

[2:15:05] thunduz: Streamer Privilege
[2:15:16] bojackhorseman2004: was a worthwhile sponsorship since you are still talking about it
[2:15:33] SlithTheSivak: years before the pokemon tcg was a glimmer in nintendos eye....dbz was king of the anime card games
[2:15:50] thunduz: the shooting in that game feels great!
[2:15:53] Zuldak: epic games is such an evil company i cant bring myself ot play fortnite
[2:16:44] thunduz: Every big game company is evil. as we’ve seen this year especially lol
[2:17:32] RosieSeren: yeah, no ethical consumption under capitalism is the line isn't it
[2:17:59] thunduz: I don’t know. you mentioned Marvel and Fortnite so everything else left my brain
[2:18:23] Grzmocillla: @MrGM today you have chance for 3 maldraxus calliung that can drops thois fucking 3 mounts
[2:18:37] Lausten: And yet you watch Twitch thats owned by Amazon? @RosieSeren 🤔
[2:18:44] OpiumHC: i think you were talking about streamer privilege and your sponsorship
[2:18:46] KaisenSiru: Callings Pog
[2:18:59] coversRbetter: i kinda miss callings, they were ez gold

[2:19:25] Thoreya: its not even comparable
[2:19:28] physalis4: are callings the covenant dailies?
[2:19:30] Thoreya: emissaries 1000x better
[2:19:31] physalis4: I forget
[2:19:51] physalis4: today as in after reset or like right now?
[2:19:53] Thoreya: remember world quests 2.0....lol
[2:19:58] Thoreya: shouldve just kept 1.0
[2:20:06] RosieSeren: @Lausten I know, its just a general phrase, like the plot of The Good Place, that's it hard to buy/consume things while still being ethical
[2:20:13] bojackhorseman2004: Oh shit Mommy GM is on her way
[2:20:35] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:20:38] bojackhorseman2004: Mommy GM and Nanny GM with baby GM
[2:21:32] Grzmocillla: srsly mounts from calling/paragons is the worst idea ever i farmed 400k nazjatar reputation to get the mount
[2:22:10] Hotstitute: paragon mounts are dumb... not even a 100% drop chance
[2:22:16] Lausten: They should just have added bad luck protection to them
[2:22:19] Hotstitute: Legion and BFA honestly
[2:22:24] Thoreya: prob legion, but i enjoyed bfa more
[2:22:26] ramzie0: I did the most world quests in Legion
[2:22:32] MogSnap: having to clear in legion was not fun
[2:22:32] Grzmocillla: BFa : turtle made it to the watter , easy kill 1 mob quest
[2:22:36] Zuldak: legion. They had followers you could get 300 gold just with their accessories
[2:23:01] BBMezzy: Legion/BfA WQs were the best WQs. Bring back the kill single named mob wqs!
[2:23:02] Thoreya: legion invasions were also GIGA for alts
[2:23:05] Thoreya: yup, insta invite
[2:23:22] canes_sauc3: Heey MrGM, long time viewer on YT. Just came across your short a min ago, any idea on the Bengal Tiger Mount?
[2:23:25] Grzmocillla: jesus i remeber i did 2 worlds quest in 30 sec
[2:23:25] ramzie0: I miss the pvp wq from legion that gave marks of honor
[2:23:32] Hotstitute: legion it was new and developing, BFA had humorous ones like the turtles, and put actual questing into the world quests not just grinds. Shadowlands tried to keep that system but the quests they used were not fun and just a massive grind, and DF is fine with its dragon riding stuff but its old at this point
[2:23:50] Lausten: The Amazon Commers
[2:24:06] Hotstitute: its probably an ultra rare
[2:24:44] Thoreya: i havent done a wq since 9.0
[2:24:46] Thoreya: legit
[2:24:49] Hotstitute: cos its old
[2:24:56] Zuldak: wow really? some WQs give 1200 gold with the dreamsurge buff
[2:25:11] ramzie0: according to warcraft mounts, the bengal tiger was activated as a make a wish for someone in 8.2.5
[2:25:14] Thoreya: i cba doing a 30 min world quest
[2:25:31] Lausten: I just got 689g from tagging along 2 other guys in to a cave for 1 min, cant complain
[2:25:31] coversRbetter: the arena world quest in ohnara always gives 600g and sometimes 1k extra
[2:25:36] KaisenSiru: Those rares are per cycle of taking control of the zone
[2:25:43] NeeK_23: you can make 10k+ per week per alt in DF easily from WQ
[2:25:53] Hotstitute: can you name the 1 mount only 1 person has ever gotten? :P
[2:26:15] Hotstitute: nope
[2:26:18] adobegainz1: FLORESECENT GREEN MECHANOSTRIDER BABAY
[2:26:23] MogSnap: the green mechanostrider
[2:26:25] adobegainz1: idk how it' spelled
[2:26:50] Jeanssi: pepe whistle, the make a wish mount
[2:27:03] physalis4: It would be funny if the 1 person that had that didn't play anymore
[2:27:07] Jeanssi: or something like that
[2:27:17] Jeanssi: kid who had cancer
[2:27:35] jasonmcnuggies: https://www.wowhead.com/item=25596/peeps-whistle

[2:32:11] wastedxtime93: It was what, a 7 week grind min if I remember correctly?
[2:32:27] Hotstitute: its prettty bad... you have to get every follower to 12+ which is automatically 26 days atleast. then you have a 30 day daily achivement
[2:32:36] Jeanssi: u need to do the laboratory like for how many weeks?
[2:32:49] Big_Rum: So todayiosthe hatching of the hippogryphs is there anyting to do like an achievment for obeservingthe event?
[2:33:14] Hotstitute: Lab is once a week yeah, which is you not screwing it up and having the correct mats on you, if you dont, you have to grind

[2:40:14] Annathebanana1986: has anyone tried the new creme egg cookie from dominoes yet? i wanna know if its worth it
[2:41:09] Annathebanana1986: 2 is enough for me haha
[2:41:13] BBMezzy: Kill the 2 worms - Spawn of Wekemara
[2:43:49] UlthraneDK: Kapp just do the achievement
[2:43:52] ramzie0: Ughhh... Blanchy spawn time kills me
[2:44:32] UlthraneDK: Don
[2:44:35] UlthraneDK: dont try
[2:44:35] Annathebanana1986: do you know the fastest way to get anima? doing dailys, mission table and ZM?
[2:44:38] MogSnap: you're obviously a blizzard employee now. give us the new stuff
[2:44:40] Calfast: You obviously have secret access to internal alpha
[2:45:02] BBMezzy: Sounds logical
[2:45:11] MogSnap: fastest nda break in history
[2:45:23] Lausten: It takes a special kind of stupid to be mad about that you dont have any new footage
[2:46:07] UlthraneDK: pikaOMG
[2:47:23] UlthraneDK: When you are dead, you do not know you are dead. It's only painful & difficult for others. The same applies when you are stupid.

[2:48:32] SlithTheSivak: the trans problem in a nutshell
[2:48:57] lithium364: i feel like they give as all hero talents before official alpha starts
[2:49:02] UlthraneDK: Last stream smh
[2:49:06] Lausten: Its like news years, people hype it up to be the biggest party of the year and it always is just mediocre, the best parties are the spontanious ones..
[2:49:08] MogSnap: this explanation is gonna be good
[2:49:09] Implied_Slight: yep, they hoped for new content and felt like an idiot so they blamed you instead

[2:49:51] BloodofOmega: the "trans problem" is where a group of people made up a problem and blame another group of people for the problem they made up that never existed
[2:50:17] Lausten: trans problem?
[2:50:30] BloodofOmega: because its what is happening to the trans community in the US
[2:50:31] Calfast: Because trans people are the current target I guess
[2:50:40] freiajin: I'm guessing because trans people have never been a poblem
[2:50:57] JaydenMAD: Until someone made it into a problem
[2:51:03] MogSnap: thats for sure where i thought that was going
[2:51:21] BloodofOmega: yeah i tried to make the explanation as un-political as i could lol
[2:52:01] SlithTheSivak: the problem is other peoples expectations, u dont owe them anything! we're lucky u provide us w entertainment, thanks Dan
[2:52:11] TheGrandmaGamer: or maybe just transfer of blame?
[2:52:39] Zuldak: i have a stupid question: where in wow is the furthest possible from a flight point, making it the most remote?
[2:52:42] Shirey12: Do you think they will milk SoD for it's runes and using existing dungeons into raids and then let it end as a season then release "classic +" after giving it a new season?
[2:52:53] RAF_Sean: Going for lunch, gonna leave you on for Shadow tho
[2:53:01] Demeternoth: GM island
[2:53:06] NeeK_23: Quel Thalas?
[2:53:08] Zuldak: the most report point furthest from a flight path
[2:53:12] twin_cloud: I really enjoyed the vid as someone who didn't watch the entire blizzcon footage. So thanks for making it!
[2:53:38] jawea: vashir?
[2:53:45] Zuldak: the Point Nemo of wow
[2:54:30] funviking99: the video was fine and I enjoyed it, seen some things I haven’t previously, I guess people are mad there are no news

[2:56:35] Shirey12: @MrGM I don't think we will get any crazy expected expanded content for SoD other than what we know (Kara, etc). It will probably be an another type of Classic that will be officially called + with a fresh wipe to keep it alive.
[2:56:44] SlithTheSivak: u wanna hop out of ur comfort zone, do a deep dive into epic pvp communities! VERY controversial!
[2:56:49] Zuldak: i wonder how much content is in 10.2.6 or if its a one time event that keeps people entertained for a day
[2:57:45] mrsrockguru: season 4 ptr after 10.2.6 has released, along with alpha.
[2:58:08] Layliah79: lol
[2:58:31] SlithTheSivak: that mans beard is perfect
[2:58:56] funviking99: dang
[2:59:27] Shirey12: They have lots of possibilities. lots of scrapped vanilla content, Mount Hyjal, Azshara (Timbermaw raid), Emerald Dream, CoT. I think Ascension and Turtle wow had great ideas for Blizzard to act on.
[2:59:28] Jelky55: i've been told that i should think less so i am not gna say anything
[3:00:20] Jelky55: Jelky55 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! mrgmDance
[3:00:42] Jelky55: soon :p
[3:01:20] Zuldak: running old content is so chill. its all about just kicking over helpless mobs and getting things done
[3:01:21] Jeanssi: super mega elite area
[3:01:46] Travnar: Go to 9:30
[3:02:03] Travnar: 9:30 is where aggrend talks about the raids
[3:03:12] Shirey12: They should've done Grim Batol re-experienced as the 25 raid. Would've been a perfect capstone for level 25 with scaling to level.
[3:03:26] Hotstitute: it wasnt SM as a raid that was "leaked".. it was Lights hope
[3:04:41] Hotstitute: that looks more like the Western plague lands zone scarlet base tho
[3:04:45] Hotstitute: they also have a fountian
[3:04:53] Hotstitute: its back to back with SM with a mountian inbetween
[3:05:04] Sleepyjoegaming: my man
[3:05:42] Hotstitute: the thing is, they had that whole concept in BC>Wrath where you sacrifice your character
[3:05:47] Hotstitute: they COULD add that
[3:05:48] Calfast: @Hotstitute The sky is different in Plaguelands, that's Tirisfal sky.
[3:06:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:06:16] mrsrockguru: @Hotstitute Lights hope does not have a tall spire, which you an see in the back ground of that image, but SM does have the cathedral spire.
[3:06:28] ratgefingah: azshara crater 3 lane base defender battleground Kappa
[3:06:46] ratgefingah: timestamps r awesome
[3:06:52] Hotstitute: @mrsrockguru Lights hope is eastern plaguelands... the last light inn has a chapel tho, thats what i originally ment.. the DK starter area
[3:07:00] Shirey12: I been wanting a Team Deathmatch BG for the longest in WoW.
[3:07:06] chelfx: seem like good lads
[3:07:11] Sleepyjoegaming: what we up to today my man
[3:07:27] Travnar: idk why they've never done TDM, seems like it would be fun
[3:07:29] Travnar: at least as brawl
[3:07:57] chelfx: Southshor vs TM was big old brawl
[3:07:59] Hotstitute: technically solo shuffle is team death match
[3:08:05] Sleepyjoegaming: wouldnt it just be like a 5v5 arena tho team deathmatch ?
[3:08:11] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[3:08:18] Travnar: Not really, TDM has respawn\
[3:08:26] Shirey12: Solo shuffle is like Search and Destroy
[3:08:39] dright424: Ashran is basically big team TDM
[3:08:40] Travnar: And usually much bigger maps with random respawn
[3:08:46] Sleepyjoegaming: yeah but it would always be handicapped due to people respawning youwould neevr turn the tide in battle haha
[3:08:47] Lausten: Packed House is 15 vs 15 Brawl 1 life
[3:09:22] Hotstitute: You have to clarify what you think team death match is.. cos in majority of games its a 1 round full team wipe.. CSGO for example
[3:09:23] Zuldak: comp stomp is 2 weeks
[3:09:31] Lausten: Thats gotta be a visual bug
[3:09:34] Hotstitute: Team death match in halo was respawn
[3:09:41] Travnar: Kinda wonder why BGs/PvP is at with Holinka gone. New BG in TWW but still seemed like he's was pushing a lot of it.
[3:09:52] Shirey12: @MrGM since we're on the subject. Do you think they will do more than 1-2 BG's for War Within since Ion promised they'd do more?
[3:09:55] chelfx: they could use Warfront NPCs to help balance TDM to help push back winning team
[3:10:20] Hotstitute: we need a strand revamp
[3:10:31] Sleepyjoegaming: you planning on pvping in war within @MrGM
[3:10:32] Lausten: @Travnar To be honest, maybe they will dare do somethiing new, Holinka was great but he was also one of the old school people holding the game back in "its always been this way"
[3:11:14] Hotstitute: they are giving pvp its own method to get gear, and not just vault.. so hopefully that helps pvp enough
[3:11:57] chelfx: the saddles are so cool
[3:12:07] funviking99: for me the elite sets are the best
[3:12:10] Shirey12: There's a conflicting war between PvP and PvE in terms of Tier. For example for S4 we got to "vote" and the PvP community was outvoted by PvE because of the tier sets.
[3:12:33] Hotstitute: id like to think the bloodmoon event is a practice run for the Void Crystal to make a whole zone be PVP for 30ish minutes.. its extremely popular

[3:13:52] chelfx: some my guildmates saying they using SoD as test ground for retail do you think they are>
[3:14:12] funviking99: yeah some horrendous rare spawns for sure LUL
[3:14:13] Hotstitute: well you could also have a pve version of it, still "blood coins" but just less, pvp gets more and a different vendor
[3:14:22] Shirey12: @chelfx maybe for removed spells to work in Hero talents. That would be amazing.
[3:14:37] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:14:46] chelfx: yeah i dont think they are too
[3:15:31] Hotstitute: the three ultra popular classes are what everyone has wanted for those classes for a long time.. Healer mage, DW Melee Hunter, Tank warlock
[3:15:42] MyNameIsWhat4: how’s the prog going on the insane title?
[3:15:55] Shirey12: I think Divine Intervention to return as a spell like DK's Corpse Explode" as a fun spell would be cool as wipe protection.
[3:16:18] Lausten: Do you have enough boxes though? ;)
[3:16:38] neverbornlucky: MrGm did you see the sneakers for 399 from a certain american  that is gold and has the american
[3:16:39] neverbornlucky: flag
[3:16:54] Shirey12: trump shoes?
[3:17:04] chelfx: Trump selling sneakers
[3:17:11] neverbornlucky: yep made from china
[3:17:25] tempo119: MrGm did you see the thing about the person who did something recently that people saw
[3:17:28] Hotstitute: his whole platform is anti china
[3:17:33] neverbornlucky: yes

[3:18:35] chelfx: they look hella cheap
[3:18:52] Shirey12: What's everyone's favorite "Removed Ability" from WoW they'd love to see return?
[3:18:56] chelfx: he needs money
[3:18:58] tempo119: well they're trump branded, they're not going to be attractive
[3:18:58] physalis4: He needs money
[3:19:00] BBMezzy: He needs money
[3:19:04] Lausten: Hes clearly trying to catch a certain age of voters
[3:19:06] BethiaB: Needs money for all his legal bills
[3:19:09] chelfx: i think its like 400 million he owes the courts
[3:19:11] physalis4: He owes over $400M in legal settlements
[3:19:16] BloodofOmega: he is selling them cause he is broke and owes so far a half billion dollars in lawsuits
[3:19:31] thunduz: imagine using your own money though
[3:19:32] Hotstitute: When it comes to specs in the game, they have changed specs and named them differently in the past.. combat into outlaw, Feral tank into guardian.. Aug (clearly suppose to be there from the start).. Replacing something like Affliction in retail with a tank spec is not off the table since they cant seem to balance it to be good but not OP and still fun to play
[3:19:33] Shirey12: 400M is lunch money for him
[3:19:46] physalis4: He's not a billionaire b/c he overstated his realestate values
[3:19:48] Lausten: Trumps one of the worst busines men arround LUL
[3:19:48] tempo119: billionaire includes non-liquid assets
[3:19:55] neverbornlucky: I don't care about the politics it was just funny seeing how stupid the sneakers were
[3:20:12] Shirey12: Shaman Tank in retail would be something fun. I liked SoD's idea
[3:20:12] michaelmm: Billionaires don't tend to have the cash just lying about. It's usually tied up in hard to sell assets like property.
[3:21:00] Hotstitute: i mean , Afflictions dot class is kinda garbo.. its nothing like Shadow priest.. so removing affliction and making shadow the primary dot class could not only make it iconic but free up the slot on Warlock
[3:21:00] physalis4: They live off credit
[3:21:06] Shirey12: @Elkhuntsman he never brought it up?
[3:21:12] michaelmm: I suspect someone like that has people to pay for meals for them. Kinda like the King never has to spend any money.
[3:21:29] tempo119: pretty weirdChamp to tell someone how to run their stream
[3:21:41] StreamElements: UNUSED Classic WoW Maps that Season of Discovery Could Utilise - https://youtu.be/x5Whfuumtj0
[3:21:42] neverbornlucky: I don't think the rock has produced anything as horrible as that lol
[3:21:48] Demeternoth: Yes, they bank at Coutts
[3:21:50] Hotstitute: they do have cash, but its not as much as you'd think.. the they have Estates
[3:21:54] michaelmm: The King doesn't carry money no. It's part of the Royal protocol.
[3:22:09] NeeK_23: I think he has a couple of fivers down the back of the sofa
[3:22:32] Hotstitute: their value and wealth is determined by their ranking, and when you move up in the line you gain new estates and lose old ones and its handed down to the next in line
[3:22:53] Shirey12: I really hope they rework Affliction @Hotstitute, UA being locked to 1 target, Doom Blossom and Dread Touch being a choice between singe target and aoe feels bad. Also Malefic Rapture being more dots more damage locks you into Siphon Life feels bad. I main lock too I feel your pain.
[3:22:54] michaelmm: He has a someone called an equerry that handles that stuff in person and ofc the Palace pays for big stuff.
[3:23:05] Hotstitute: when the queen died, king charles handed off his stuff to his son, and his son became a billionaire
[3:23:13] chelfx: The crown its so i guess kinda
[3:23:26] neverbornlucky: Scottland had given it to the queen . I think they just gave the scottland place back to scottland
[3:23:30] Hotstitute: just in assets
[3:23:31] michaelmm: Balmoral is personally owned by the queen - it's not a crown property.
[3:23:38] losttobaldness: Just buy NVDA Calls :)
[3:23:47] Roflrobbie: hey fam
[3:23:51] Roflrobbie: long time no see
[3:23:52] Hotstitute: they dont pay for it tho, they also do not pay taxes like the common man
[3:23:57] NeeK_23: William now owns most of Cornwall, like Charles did before being King
[3:23:57] michaelmm: The royals do have some independant income.
[3:24:08] neverbornlucky: I miss your british Queen she was a interesting lady
[3:24:13] Lausten: appanage
[3:24:22] Hotstitute: alot of charities .. which are also handed own the line
[3:24:35] michaelmm: The King is completely exempt from taxes but the other royals have to pay tax on any independant income sources.
[3:24:47] Hotstitute: he still has a royal value, just not like william
[3:24:59] Demeternoth: He said his mum left him money and he's living on that
[3:25:02] neverbornlucky: He gave up his royal status so now he has to bring in money
[3:25:02] thunduz: yeah he’s working at the local dennys
[3:25:12] Hotstitute: technically williams son is a billion times more rich then harry lol
[3:25:19] michaelmm: Harry's no longer supported by the Crown - that was removed by the queen when he left the UK.
[3:25:52] neverbornlucky: MrGm its cause of the biscuit and gravy. Once british people have that they don't want to go back
[3:25:59] Hotstitute: they also sold alot of privatized rights to their story across the world for a large sum of money
[3:26:10] physalis4: I donno...my wife read his book Spare, and it sounded pretty bad
[3:26:47] Shirey12: It's delicious.
[3:26:51] Hotstitute: honestly... biscuits and gravy is gross... its like eating slop
[3:26:55] Hotstitute: or haggis
[3:26:59] Travnar: It's like a totally different gravy tho than UK gravy right
[3:26:59] physalis4: It's called Spare b/c he was told he's basically spare parts if any of his family needs organs
[3:27:01] neverbornlucky: jolly youtube channel loved it
[3:27:01] chelfx: But you put beans on toast
[3:27:09] Roflrobbie: biscuits and gravy like in america?
[3:27:11] Hotstitute: what gravy tho, brown or white gravy?
[3:27:11] databob1: @mrgm you just don't know man it's soooooo good
[3:27:18] michaelmm: The queen massively reduced the number of the royals who are funded by the crown about 10 years ago.
[3:27:19] Hotstitute: popeyes has it
[3:27:24] BBMezzy: You're a liar? So that one guy was right!
[3:27:30] Travnar: So imagine that but 10x better since it's not from a fast food lol
[3:27:31] HaloS23: Ive been watching one guy from Brittan that loves the sweet tea!
[3:27:39] michaelmm: IIRC it's only the top 4/5 in line to the throne now that get public money.
[3:27:43] Roflrobbie: its a sausage gravy usually for breakfast
[3:27:52] Shirey12: Next time you're in America, go to a Waffle House or Denny's and grab some. It'll make you rethink it
[3:27:57] neverbornlucky: They got hooked on deeping their fry's in milkshakes in america
[3:27:57] physalis4: the rest of them get titles

[3:28:14] physalis4: Waffle House is bis
[3:28:16] Hotstitute: @HaloS23 im Australian living in the US and i find Sweet Tea of any kind disgusting lol its different strokes
[3:28:32] physalis4: Where's Aaron to back me up?
[3:28:35] Roflrobbie: its a classic american dish original used for MREs for armed forces
[3:28:36] Shirey12: Gold Peak sweet tea. Ugh I love it
[3:28:38] michaelmm: A lot of the family aren't that well off. The reason a lot of stately homes are open to the public is to fund their upkeep.
[3:28:41] Hotstitute: Waffle house is good food, and a show :D
[3:28:48] Roflrobbie: not to mention its delicious
[3:28:55] neverbornlucky: MrGm half and half tea is so much better its lemonaid and tea together
[3:28:59] physalis4: Waffle House at 3am is peak entertainment
[3:29:04] Lausten: In Denmark the royal family have had their appanage revoked by the queen a few years ago..So only the closest to the prince (now king) get appanage

[3:30:19] Shirey12: here's another great American breakfast item. Steak and Eggs.
[3:30:25] neverbornlucky: A lot of royals have  sponsor events they run and companies
[3:30:43] Shirey12: Chicken and Waffles are great
[3:30:48] Roflrobbie: eggs are chickens
[3:30:50] Travnar: It's not chicken, it's chicken fried steak. Basically deep fried steak with breading
[3:30:58] neverbornlucky: MrGm that statement tells me you have never had c chicken and waffles together

[3:32:45] Hotstitute: @michaelmm this.. BUT charles is a weird exception.. he has a national park (was not a national park until he became king) where he goes every weekend and walks.. actually walks the entire park, you can bump into him, no entry fee
[3:32:53] Shirey12: we have a Steak egg cheese bagel sandwich for breakfast at my local Mcdonald's here in the great state of Indiana lol
[3:33:08] Hotstitute: probably not walking any more cos he got diagnosed
[3:33:18] wastedxtime93: Bisquits and Gravy <3
[3:33:24] Hotstitute: @MrGM do you know what American style scrambled eggs is?
[3:33:28] neverbornlucky: Grits is pure american
[3:33:32] databob1: it comes from schnitzel
[3:33:38] Lausten: @Hotstitute The worst
[3:33:45] BBMezzy: Is cereal not classic american breakfast?
[3:33:45] Lheela: classic american breakfast is a royale with cheese, but they call it a quarterpounder, because of the imperial system
[3:34:03] Hotstitute: frying pan
[3:34:09] Hotstitute: just keep stirring lol
[3:34:16] wastedxtime93: Goetta is pretty fire as well
[3:34:18] thunduz: do you guys not have scrambled eggs?
[3:34:27] thunduz: what did I miss?
[3:34:34] PuNk42AE: @thunduz LUL
[3:34:36] Hotstitute: my british mother cooked eggs in a saucepan.. was weirdddd
[3:34:37] Lausten: Its usually overcooked eggs, thats the issue
[3:34:37] Shirey12: a good omelet with hot sauce slaps
[3:34:41] iRegretn0thing: Oh true!

[3:35:21] iRegretn0thing: Off topic but I find it so funny that Ferrets in the US are like pets while over there they're like hunting companions which is so cool!
[3:35:24] Roflrobbie: if your buying from the mass market grocery stores you gotta keep em in the fridge. Once eggs are cold they gotta stay cold
[3:35:24] neverbornlucky: some put kitchup on their eggs here
[3:35:35] medvet03: That's because the way American eggs are treated/processed. It removes the protective layer all eggs naturally have.
[3:35:38] thunduz: my mom used to make scrambled egg sandwiches. Scrambled egg, Mayo, cheese, and burger bun
[3:35:39] Shirey12: @MrGM growing up my father put Hot Sauce on eggs. He told me its big boy ketchup and I put it on my eggs from now on.
[3:35:42] DocOtter06: I go with ketchup on my scrambled eggs
[3:35:42] HaloS23: ^ i do
[3:35:46] databob1: only commercial eggs if you get them fresh you can just leave them out just gotta wash them properly first
[3:36:11] Hotstitute: some parts of Australia use Milk in their scrambled eggs.. its weirdddd.. The french slow cook it on the heat.. the british according to gordon ramsey is on the heat, off the heat
[3:36:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:36:12] neverbornlucky: MrGm have you see how many kid cereals are banned in UK cause of whats in it

[3:36:58] BetsiBoombasket: hot sauce is the only way
[3:37:01] Hotstitute: minks in the US are hunting companions
[3:37:05] neverbornlucky: yes we have a problem in america with eggs raw. We can't eat raw cookie dough anymore

[3:37:09] chelfx: I like cutting up fresh tomatoes
[3:37:10] Shirey12: hot sauce = big boy ketchup.
[3:37:11] iRegretn0thing: From Colorado, standard practice to put hot sauce on eggs or even green chili.
[3:37:13] chelfx: on eggs
[3:37:13] BetsiBoombasket: absolutely!
[3:37:14] DevoidX: eggs in the UK are the most common source of salmonella infections
[3:37:15] HaloS23: dont knock it till you try!!!
[3:37:19] databob1: I don't like kacthup
[3:37:20] stellabellas: i usually have scrabled eggs for dinner
[3:37:27] NeeK_23: americans having the ring of fire all day
[3:37:31] databob1: mustard is good too
[3:37:43] Hotstitute: i dont like ketchup... i like tomato sauce :)
[3:37:46] wastedxtime93: Over half our country runs on Nicotine and energy drinks to make it thru the day, a little hot sauce in the morning is nothing
[3:37:49] DevoidX: brown sauce or put it in the bin
[3:37:50] Roflrobbie: hot sauce is good for you
[3:37:53] chelfx: Fresh tomatoes over ketchup for me on eggs
[3:37:53] Shirey12: mustard in the morning is a crime
[3:38:01] neverbornlucky: I hate mustard
[3:38:04] thunduz: it's common source of salmonella becuase you dont put them in the fridge
[3:38:19] databob1: or horseradish
[3:38:27] RosieSeren: always wondered about american taco bell, always seen jokes about upsetting your guts, but british taco bell is really mild

[3:38:35] chelfx: dijon mustard is spicier
[3:38:35] DevoidX: american mustard is the worst. completely different to english or french mustard
[3:38:59] thunduz: mustard in any form is gross
[3:39:02] chelfx: Dijon mustard is a traditional mustard of France and its more spicy
[3:39:04] iRegretn0thing: I think mustard, like ketchup, can be good in a small amount but its so easy for it to overpower anything.
[3:39:04] Hotstitute: Mustard of the worlds is my yearly Christmas calander
[3:39:12] Shirey12: French's brand mustard >>>>
[3:39:21] Lheela: bavarian breakfast is white sausage, pretzel and beer. no joke
[3:39:25] HaloS23: wonder if it was a horseraddish version
[3:39:26] DevoidX: that's uk mustard ('colmans')
[3:39:27] wastedxtime93: So much American condiment slander here D:
[3:39:43] Hotstitute: did you know there is a cheese that can kill you?
[3:39:51] iRegretn0thing: I think beer was a super standard breakfast, lunch, and dinner staple.
[3:40:07] eziekiyah: you don’t like hot sauce?!?!? well clearly we can’t listen to anything you say then.
[3:40:22] thunduz: MRGM I'm taking the family to disney. What foods would you like me to enjoy in your honor?
[3:40:27] Hotstitute: you do season chicken tho right?
[3:40:39] RosieSeren: i think beer was common because unlike water which could be infected, beer would always be okay in olden times
[3:40:43] Hotstitute: Churro's :o
[3:40:44] Shirey12: I saw Talesin talking about cheese in the U.S. is bad compared to the U.K. I've tried both and nothing competes with some good Wisconsin cheese from wisconsin. (The cheese state).
[3:40:52] thunduz: The World, the only one that matters
[3:40:58] iRegretn0thing: @thunduz I work at Disney World, hit me up ;)
[3:41:01] Hotstitute: cheese in the US is kinda garbage lol
[3:41:12] NeeK_23: american cheese hmmmm ok pass

[3:41:26] neverbornlucky: If you want to hit americans on food go about our chocolate
[3:41:29] Hotstitute: oh its not.. american cheese is super processed
