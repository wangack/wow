[0:18:40] thatsnotmycup: sodaPls
[0:18:42] Sealiony: caps are for raiding
[0:18:43] jurassics_best: 308 skill is nice, because glancing blows are reduced by a bunch
[0:18:45] andywho22: depends what level thing you're attacking
[0:18:46] Mepcsa: @sodapoppin hardcap only apploes at max level
[0:18:46] SchizoForever: xdd you need it
[0:18:48] theleviathan69: chat has no idea what they are talking about, its all relative to mob level
[0:18:49] Nolli_el: @sodapoppin  caps are only for raiding
[0:18:49] Sharrak0r: helm OR gloves, more than +7 or 8 really doesn't do anything
[0:18:51] Jarovi_: 9 is cap, chat
[0:18:51] Hallanwaara: Does it cap even if your low lvl?
[0:18:51] WhuDoneIt: for lvl 60, but you can kill mobs more than 3 lvls above you
[0:18:52] kb_h: hard caps are max level so maybe useful underlevel
[0:18:52] gorillafingr_tv: it's not hardcap but there it's not worth the return after
[0:18:53] vironex: 8 is for dodge not parry
[0:18:54] New_Game_Plus_o7: isn't hit still good if attacking higher levels?
[0:18:54] jra322: soda doing 2x flurry is good if ur tank because faster weapons = better

[0:18:55] New_Game_Plus_o7: yeah
[0:18:57] iduckbro: docnotL fucking do it anyways
[0:18:57] Treestars: for leveling it will be great
[0:18:58] bloodsnaill: Technically it’s a soft cap but the hard cap is 30 or something you can only do with daggers
[0:18:59] luzzilost: xdd just buy everything
[0:18:59] Garrett_b: or lower level
[0:19:00] SchizoForever: hard cap is max
[0:19:01] itschampa: Yeah the hard cap would only apply to level 60
[0:19:01] vironex: dumbasses

[5:07:39] Londarr: Found this: he term "mobile object" [1][2][3][4] was used by Richard Bartle for objects that were self-mobile in MUD1.[1] Later source code in DikuMUD used the term "mobile" to refer to a generic NPC, shortened further to "mob" in identifiers. DikuMUD was a heavy influence on EverQuest,[14][15] and the term as it exists in MMORPGs is derived from the MUD usage.[5][1]. The term is properly an abbreviation rather than an acronym.
