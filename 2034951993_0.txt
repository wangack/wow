[1:46:34] tavanij: @Beriech 100g is valued at $13 currently. so 50g/hour is equivalent to roughly $6.50 an hour. This does not include the time it takes to level multiple toons up to max level and farm these quests. I value my time a lot more than less than $6 an hour

[1:54:36] voltrix07: @snutzy I just started lvling a warrior man there so much fun. you liking it?
[1:54:58] Nsixtyfour: the best thing about warrior is lack of competition for gear
[1:55:01] PastryDeath: I submit that blizzard made a mistake by making phases 2+ months.
[1:55:01] sum1thatplaysgames: I still haven't decided on a main yet.
[1:55:09] PastryDeath: or at least the first phase
[1:55:13] voltrix07: @snutzy bro is it me or r the warriors runes so hard to get ? lol
[1:55:35] feardotrun: havent decided main yet :O and u call urself a lock
[1:55:35] Nsixtyfour: yeah warriors kinda got the shaft
[1:55:37] sum1thatplaysgames: The struggle! I liked lock but my  IRL friend decided on it. The loot gods blessed my mage today maybe I will stick with that.
[1:56:06] Zeroflex1: I bet mage gets dragons breath
[1:56:09] sum1thatplaysgames: sometimes the RNG Gods decide your main for sure

[1:56:58] CamillionaireIRL: PepeLaugh
[1:57:36] voltrix07: @snutzy what’s been ur normal rotation man?
[1:57:56] Nsixtyfour: I'm a dad now and decided priest is my best bet. Saves time getting groups.
[1:58:10] voltrix07: wait what’s sunder again? I feel like I haven’t been using it lmao
[1:58:56] voltrix07: oh shit man I haven’t been using that? lol is that recommended ?

[2:02:51] cokexdxd: u think they will add 2h dual wield to a rune?
[2:03:19] xSwavy97: druids get wolf shed helm next phase right?
[2:04:45] AyoPete1: @xSwavy97 no actually I don't think so, because one of the items needed to craft it, you make from a 230 profession.. and I think profs will be capped at 225
[2:05:11] mooseal: 2hand or dual wield for WSG warrior
[2:05:18] xSwavy97: I was about to say feral is about to be insane with wolf shed and pummler

[3:04:06] JaeKAllDay: also raging blow builds rage but doesnt use any
[3:04:08] cokexdxd: warrior pretty ResidentSleeper due to this rune
[3:04:28] JaeKAllDay: 2h warrior is top dps
[3:04:33] JaeKAllDay: a lot of the time
[3:04:36] NailnScrew: you need to afk auto attack for a bit
[3:04:36] cokexdxd: yeah but u cant blow ur load ever u just gotta stay above 80 rage
[3:04:58] JaeKAllDay: once you get fathom or hydras and some gear in bfd you just pump
[3:04:58] NailnScrew: ez
[3:05:42] JaeKAllDay: this quest should give massive xp at level 24
[3:05:58] siic3d: rage potions are really good with consumed by rage
[3:06:04] siic3d: on pull
[3:06:39] JaeKAllDay: charge, blood rage, raging blow auto auto auto quickstrike, raging, you also have deepwounds i believe so your dps is going to be higher than you think
[3:06:40] NailnScrew: ive also heard top dps wars are just spamming devastate rune?
[3:06:41] Cross86: is frenzied assault not good when using a 2h?
[3:06:57] Kusig: go over 80 then drop under and go over
[3:07:07] paxz07: no shot the  dub hits bfd
[3:07:10] Kusig: you want to repeatedly drop just below and over to re trigger
[3:07:12] paxz07: this is the kinda run u pull swords from
[3:07:21] JaeKAllDay: yeah you want to be like 90 rage then use qs to go to 70 then your auto will put you back at like 90 and you just keep it at that threshold
[3:07:21] paxz07: no WA ?
[3:07:24] JaelawTV: yo..

[3:14:12] cokexdxd: yes
[3:14:27] shreddingog: dont stay above
[3:14:31] siic3d: stary arouind 80rage
[3:14:33] NailnScrew: you balance your enrage stacks
[3:14:33] Andrettiixd: Stay around 80 rage
[3:14:38] cokexdxd: keep going above and under it to keep proiccing the buff
[3:14:38] siic3d: 100% enrage uptime basically
[3:14:41] surrow1337: you need to go above then under
[3:14:43] Andrettiixd: Make sure you're always enraged for damage buff
[3:14:45] djbetrayer: get to 80 then dip under then go over 80 again to reproc enrage
[3:14:47] siic3d: drop rage with quick strikes
[3:14:49] surrow1337: every 12 secs
[3:14:50] shreddingog: you jump down below 80 whenever u are above 80, and store rage to get above 80 to refresh the buff
[3:14:53] siic3d: and raging blow offf cd
[3:14:54] JaeKAllDay: you want to constantly go bellow and above when raging blow is off cd
[3:15:23] shreddingog: at 100 you lose out on potential rage and if you dont cross 80, you lose out on uptime
[3:15:24] Trashcan_Player: stay above 60 rge and below 100
[3:15:27] JaeKAllDay: blood rage allows you to use raging aswell
[3:15:29] NailnScrew: yea raging blow is FREE
[3:15:51] JaeKAllDay: and raging blow generates rage
[3:15:57] JaeKAllDay: so use blood rage when u can
[3:16:16] kenmi2: chat is fathomblade better than DW with the 1h sword for lady saravess and OH fist from akumai?
[3:16:33] JaeKAllDay: @kenmi2 id say yes
[3:16:37] shreddingog: @kenmi2 for parses yes, for killtime no.

[3:17:00] shreddingog: you cleave better with fathom blade, but your damage on the lady is actually lower
[3:17:02] NailnScrew: i like dual wield when im not tanking and 2hnd when im MT
[3:17:13] JaeKAllDay: i crit for 600+ with fathom and hydras
[3:17:25] siic3d: try get 100rage from mobs before pull
[3:17:33] cokexdxd: fuck it
[3:17:37] cmf_westers: well based of like 30 BFD runs if your warrior isnt full geared after 2 runs you're a statistical anomaly
[3:17:39] djbetrayer: priest should homunculus
[3:17:40] Zikaq: No humonculus?
[3:17:40] shreddingog: priest should use homonculi
[3:17:40] NailnScrew: fuck sunder if u have homunculi
[3:17:41] JaeKAllDay: one priest should have homunc
[3:17:49] shreddingog: you have 2 so if one use, sunder is just wasted rage
[3:17:51] Ziil01: you have 2 priests, one will homincul
[3:18:10] cmf_westers: every group I've been in has had 1 warrior and like 10 warrior drops per raid
[3:18:10] shreddingog: also usually u wna store up 78 rage
[3:18:15] shreddingog: before pull
[3:18:20] jubofdahut: o my god LMAO
[3:18:56] Racialftwx: LMFAO
[3:18:58] Humicrobe: ohhhh

[3:19:42] shreddingog: hey train weapon skill on trash at least :D
[3:20:07] shreddingog: oh LOL
[3:20:49] NailnScrew: in a perfect world, you could get someone to q you from UC for WSG and go train real quick while 3 people go out to summon xD
[3:21:16] shreddingog: or just have someone summon :D
[3:22:52] NailnScrew: so yea, thats basically it lol
[3:23:10] JaeKAllDay: bis 1h btw
[3:23:34] shreddingog: execute is only worth last 8 sec of fight while below 40 rage according to what I've read, but I am no expert on that nieche part of warrior rotation
[3:23:39] JaeKAllDay: just going to be a lucky run i feel it
[3:23:48] JaeKAllDay: legs of faithful pants fingers crossed
[3:23:58] shreddingog: you want uptime to last and you want to have spent initial rage on quick strikes

[3:27:39] JaeKAllDay: youre not using blood rage
[3:27:42] NailnScrew: %^
[3:27:43] JaeKAllDay: you gotta use your T lol
[3:27:54] NailnScrew: blood rage in between pulls
[3:27:58] JaeKAllDay: it gives you a free raging strike
[3:27:59] JaeKAllDay: everytime
[3:28:06] JaeKAllDay: it counts as "enraged"
[3:28:38] jubofdahut: epic chest  for tonk
[3:28:44] jubofdahut: gloves for dps
[3:28:59] JaeKAllDay: fathomblade is a huge win the rest of this run is just bank

[3:29:27] Ramblob: is there bis gear in bs for next phase
[3:30:11] JaeKAllDay: fathom is 1% hit
[3:30:18] kamikazis: its in ure bag
[3:30:35] JaeKAllDay: 3 set is also 1% rage
[3:30:43] JaeKAllDay: hit*
[3:31:37] JaeKAllDay: stack behind where boss is standing during march of murlocs so you cant get it
[3:31:44] NailnScrew: hope you get a helm too
[3:32:00] NailnScrew: if you dont already have the brutal one

[3:34:58] JaeKAllDay: tragic
[3:35:30] JaeKAllDay: also dont worry about execute if they get low just spam quickstrike
[3:35:36] moistspeedo: had epic sword drop once and rolled a 5 lost it to a pala that rolled 15
[3:35:48] R2d2____: gross
[3:36:16] R2d2____: I've still not seen it drop at all
[3:36:39] moistspeedo: that feel when you see a low 15 roll and you think you have it in the bag surely but then roll 5, was depressing

[3:51:57] JaeKAllDay: the fathomblast looks good in combat
[3:52:21] JaeKAllDay: hydra strike looks better as a weapon model but yeah fathomblast effect on hit is pretty sweet
