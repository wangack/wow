[10:24:41] NotASkiller: @skinnnypanda SeemsGood
[10:25:08] Tabrill: adam: after forcing the chat to sit through 10 and a half hours of dragon lands content, a BFD TK KT only double feature is the least Bean could do! and that's a damn Bean's guarantee!
[10:25:36] NotASkiller: @buttsoap it be would take a sub goal challenge for bean to ever do t k again
[10:25:43] NotASkiller: om Adam

[10:28:10] NotASkiller: @brothafeesh Rainwater isn't potable Stare
[10:28:31] brothafeesh: potable Hmmge
[10:29:00] Tabrill: adam: this guy must think BFD stands for Best friends disappointment. Because he has let all of us, his dearest friends and well wishes, down. damn! damn! damn! I knew I should have been a Zeroji viewer!
[10:29:10] NotASkiller: drinking water aka yes probably contaminated
[10:29:17] brothafeesh: om
[10:29:21] brothafeesh: hes gonna get triggered
[10:29:25] quib_96: ddHuh
[10:29:25] Buttsoap: kermit: hey bean good morning! just finished reading a 40 minute conversation between koop and crytikal about the vaccine in my discord, it was a civil and profound discussion that definitely came to a agreed opinion being held. its amazing what can happen when people arent afraid to have these conversations, wow!
[10:29:58] NotASkiller: kermitNODDERS
[10:30:24] brothafeesh: (they definitely didnt call eachother retarded)
[10:31:02] scarlboro: queen: bean can you ask fusion what his stance on the vax is?
[10:31:20] brothafeesh: kermit: another broken promise by bean, adam: MAN! kermit: why do we even watch this guy? my streamer feels bad man
[10:31:20] ripinpeace10: i love when half my addons dont work on patch day

[10:32:56] Waizzuu: Hello sir
[10:32:56] Nathanew321: om
[10:34:07] brothafeesh: kermit: has anyone ever seen a picture of bean on his walk? has he ever provided in evidence? in my opinion, i dont think he actually goes on walks. i think he orders mc dons after stream and talks shit on us! adam: MAN!
[10:34:30] Tabrill: adam: I heard zeroji leveled a whole new character on SOD because he found out a viewer of his missed out of his stream community's BFD. Now that is what I call a good streamer. Someone that not only reads chat, but cares about his chatters. Zeroji would never pretend to go on a walk to avoid his chat

[10:38:04] ciggyman: oldge
[10:38:04] scarlboro: queen: do you guys think if we keep bothering bean about BFD that he'll eventually do a BFD? what i'm getting at is that we need to do a BFD before reset. In other words, BFD resets in a few hours.
[10:38:16] brothafeesh: adam: my brothers in arms. load up the KJ COOMs next time hes in arena we really GIVE IT TO HIM! man!

[10:39:06] cmxmage: u mean feral is back?
[10:39:16] NotASkiller: Adam: you wouldn't get these fried ass t t esses if he would do what he's supposed to do and keep the viewers busy with a b f d. They'd be busy raiding and we wouldn't get these annoying t t s . It's your fault, chat. For not putting the pressure on him for b f d.
