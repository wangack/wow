[0:33:35] Morgonbladet: maybe mods can do ads when you go afk

[1:18:42] TheM0L3: In Ark you tame most things by nocking them out with tranquilizers and then feeding them while they are unconsious rather than the pokeballs.  Otherwise very similar to Ark that you capture different dinos for different tasks.
[1:18:47] xserelepex: put a wall down

[1:28:13] Collnaris: a lot of hours
[1:28:16] fridxa: Is this game based on USA?
[1:28:38] Lynade: @Taylor131313 I solved this by making my base very flat, meaning almost no stairs or second levels etc
[1:28:46] baumathtomba: maybe the weak ones need to be eaten by the others.
[1:28:49] Collnaris: @fridxa yes most of the wildlife here carries guns

[1:32:32] skyllaex: if he thinks everything is a pokemon ripoff, I have bad news for him. Pokemon itself is a "ripoff" from dragon quest Kappa

[1:34:14] Tastyjuice21: @fridxa nintentdo already expressed they wont be sueing
[1:34:23] Zanth11: i mean nintendo doens't own the word pal

[1:34:42] Tastyjuice21: gamefreak rather
[1:34:53] Lorrdzik: @fridxa they would sue them before this realse if they wanted/could
[1:34:54] texanrange: that’s so crazy Nintendo won’t sue.. but noble
[1:35:01] skyllaex: @fridxa for what? having a certain design that's been used in mythology etc? go lookup dragon quest and tell me if Nintendo should be sued then (game is from 1986 while pokemon is 1996)
[1:35:01] Sne4ky79: @fridxa it wont
[1:35:14] Lorrdzik: @texanrange I think they would lose the case tbh that is why they dont do it
[1:35:18] fridxa: i mean some pals are literal 1 to 1 of some pokemons
[1:35:43] PirateCaptainEtc: Yeah Nintendo is known to deploy lawyers, and it hasnt

[1:35:57] Taylor131313: time to put points in HP eh? xdd
[1:35:57] Wardrick7: do we have a death counter? xdd
[1:35:59] rocknsake: they prob did the math and even if they do get sued, they are still extremely profitable
[1:36:08] Dwysterr: imo chat hear me out, court case happens, new genre is defined 'monster capture game', palworld changes the world
[1:36:09] Collnaris: there's also been a lot of pokemon ripoffs already
[1:36:16] Max_Winters_: i doubt they put thousands of hours and millions of dollars into this game without making sure its legally protected
[1:36:18] duor: apparently palworld devs are japanese too so if nintendo wanted to they'd have nuked this in japanese courts years ago
[1:36:21] Taylor131313: can you even respec or you're stuck to your stamina weight build?
[1:36:26] inPosition: This isn't a pokemon game outside of similar pal lookalikes

[1:39:01] skyllaex: @Taylor131313 damage is a dead stat later on tho, so I'd not even invest in it at all. Pals will do way more damage then you eventually. better off putting it in HP/stamina/weight
[1:39:12] Collnaris: there's memory drugs??? wat KEKW
[1:39:15] Collnaris: had no idea

[1:39:55] peacekeeperpk87: i do weight, stamina and attack
[1:40:01] Collnaris: i think the point of combat is to have your pals do most the work anyway

[2:01:07] Marascon: @alexmilleriscool you can catch em through a glitch
[2:01:10] Risantos: This is how we want Pokemon to be, that is why some pokemon fans love this game
[2:01:18] Valehaeel: There's a glitch/bug that makes them catchable
[2:01:30] alexmilleriscool: i see
[2:01:32] skyllaex: @alexmilleriscool catching them is only possible with a glitch, and doesn't add a +1 to the cap counter (and I believe also doesn't count as a win)

[2:01:51] eielwind: Pokémon could do this so easily but other than arceus it’s the same game over and over tbh
[2:01:56] rhirne12: i know it's not MMO.. i bought it myself.. by it has more elemnts to it

[2:14:49] Collnaris: isn't shipping protection an extra cost to opt in to though?
[2:15:13] PneumaWHU: https://imgur.com/a/AAmqZ4M for example, protection almost doubles the shipping cost in this case

[2:33:57] skibbatv: As a qualified twitch chatter, AI good 'cause Elon and organic food waste of money stick to burgers and steak

[2:34:17] daerbgge: It's the year 3000, games are now labeled as follows: Made by real human hands! Fresh, all natural.
[2:34:17] Hubris423: Yeah, Mcdonalds French fries are a good example of that
[2:34:18] Collnaris: @skibbatv 1000% basado
[2:34:32] cwsincla: The concept of "organic food" often carries the misconception that it involves no use of pesticides. In reality, organic farming does use pesticides, but the key difference lies in the type and origin of these pesticides.

[2:35:05] skibbatv: @Simply_Ryanari Leave my organic fried butter out of this
[2:35:09] TheM0L3: @texanrange Organic food (milk especially) tends to have further out expiration dates I know what you mean.

[2:35:54] Bloodmatch: Not really
[2:35:57] Simply_Ryanari: nope, organic basically means non gmo
[2:35:57] TheM0L3: "Organic milk lasts longer because producers use a different process to preserve it. According to the Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, the milk needs to stay fresh longer because organic products often have to travel farther to reach store shelves since it is not produced throughout the country."
[2:36:05] triob: ahh crap now i'm hungry

[2:40:24] TheM0L3: "The process that gives the milk a longer shelf life is called ultrahigh temperature (UHT) processing or treatment, in which milk is heated to 280 degrees Fahrenheit (138 degrees Celsius) for two to four seconds, killing any bacteria in it."  (typical pasturization does not heat it that much)

[3:24:09] Elias_Age: Dungeon will disappear on timer, it can spawn at the same place or somethere else - there is a limited number of dungeons at time @anniefuchsia

[4:05:39] Axel_VIII8: There is a tundra and a Volcano but they are endgame
[4:05:48] bennet_r: Free Pal Alliance - sounds like something this game really needs
[4:05:52] Chryterion: How long does it take for the wow drop, 4 hours?
[4:06:02] Collnaris: you should play palworld and have wow on smaller screen for drop progress ez
[4:06:07] gunshypaper08: can raids happen when your not at your base?
[4:06:20] krawoom14: are they only attacking the base that you are currently in? or could there be an attack on your 2nd base as well?
[4:06:24] Taylor131313: didn't do any of the new patch content cuz it looked super boring, but I would enjoy some mount/tmog runs

[4:15:40] blind719: @OJil__ It certainly got me confused, my cat is in the other room :D
[4:15:50] OJil__: @OJil__ lmao
[4:16:00] ogkrazie: My wife wants me to get this for us both, does anyone know if you can use a single player character on co-op or do you have to make a whole new character to play co-op?
[4:16:01] Elkariam: @blind719 LUL
[4:16:31] Elkariam: think you have to make a whole new character on a server
[4:16:41] trakshun21: @ogkrazie Yes you can you can Co-Op with up to 4 people
[4:17:00] Elkariam: I am in the wrong then
[4:17:00] Sne4ky79: @ogkrazie different character for sp and mp
[4:17:01] OJil__: @ogkrazie Polygon says You can either host or join your friends in a personal save file (up to four players) or you can join a dedicated server (up to 32 players)
[4:17:24] trakshun21: @ogkrazie oh sorry i misunderstood the character that joins the host is tied to the host you cant transfer characters in
[4:17:33] Sne4ky79: @Sne4ky79 but for co op no
[4:17:40] ogkrazie: @ogkrazie Okay so to play co-op you pretty much have to start all over from scratch
[4:18:14] OJil__: @ogkrazie THAT im not sure
[4:18:36] trakshun21: @ogkrazie if you already have a game you can turn co-op on
[4:19:18] Elkariam: if what people saying is correct it can seem like if you play on your save your wife can join in your game as a new character on the same file
[4:19:22] skyllaex: can we name a custom marker?
[4:19:32] trakshun21: no sadly
[4:19:49] Annies_Bot: Blerps resumed!
[4:20:03] Joneeeez: Pal team is starving FR

[4:35:45] OJ_Hype: Annie nintendo is going to release a limited run of pink pastel coloured joycons with the new princess peach game in march https://twitter.com/NintendoCanada/status/1749800425002562010
[4:36:05] OJ_Hype: might be hard to get
[4:36:08] OJ_Hype: if its a limited run
[4:36:12] daerbgge: i needs its, preciousss..
[4:36:16] ancientstatue: how to level up so quick for exp
[4:36:20] Aegis_2566: For normal people hard to get
[4:36:27] ItsCharise: me too, but I just bought controllers from the pastel line t_t
[4:36:44] RalphMullin: just pink
[4:36:44] Collnaris: @ItsCharise what colors BibleThump
[4:36:51] ItsCharise: @Collnaris pink and yellow
[4:36:54] Celc1us: shouldve been a crown on them
[4:37:00] OJ_Hype: true
[4:37:08] Aegis_2566: Annie did you read about your sister's pc fans?
[4:37:27] ItsCharise: @Collnaris but if I had known, I would have waited and gotten the fully pink :(
[4:38:05] Aegis_2566: If it's just pink then it's time to put Nintendo into the same drawer as lego
[4:38:10] OJ_Hype: various pastel colours
[4:38:13] OJ_Hype: not new
[4:38:20] OJ_Hype: similar to the animal crossing switch
[4:38:24] ItsCharise: they have had it for a while https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1664444222601142278?s=20
[4:38:26] drzaius31: came out last year
[4:38:30] Taylor131313: am I the only one who doesn't give a crap about how my controller looks as long as it works xdd
[4:38:32] Aegis_2566: Lego has become such a shit company
[4:38:33] OJ_Hype: no the pink is new
[4:38:39] Collnaris: oh i see them
[4:38:50] ItsCharise: each set comes with 2 colors
[4:39:12] OJ_Hype: ye so the solid pink for both i guess is the limited run
[4:39:22] ItsCharise: 1 pink 1 yellow haha
[4:39:30] RalphMullin: @ItsCharise why?
[4:40:09] Collnaris: surprised they didn't have 2 of each for $79
[4:40:11] ItsCharise: @RalphMullin idk they just sell it that way, my switch came with 1 yellow and blue as it was a limited edition splatoon.
[4:40:11] befrosty7: How many giga balls do you have?
[4:41:27] befrosty7: We have to farm so much ore for the balls and building. It's crazy.
[4:41:39] Collnaris: @ItsCharise you got the splatoon switch? Pog that one is so cool
[4:41:41] Sne4ky79: @RalphMullin release switch was blue/red joycons never same
[4:41:59] xMrBackStabx: @befrosty7 Do you have a 2nd base at any of the good ore farming spots?
[4:42:09] therealjmac0991: i wish my armor didnt break every 3 hits
[4:42:15] shapebender: food
[4:42:16] Mortiie_: Just found out you get +50 stacking carry capacity for every Cattiva in your party.
[4:42:27] RalphMullin: @Sne4ky79 I got 2 black o.o
[4:42:39] Sne4ky79: Pog
[4:42:49] Collnaris: just like what santa gave you
[4:43:07] Berbinator88: @Mortiie_ holy shit that's huge lol, didn't know that O_O
[4:43:35] befrosty7: @xMrBackStabx Yeah, I wish i could have 3 or 4 mini bases for farming lol
[4:43:59] ItsCharise: @Collnaris Yeah it was actually the same price as the normal OLED, tho in hindsight I would have preferred the full white look better LUL
[4:44:11] OJ_Hype: Annie looks like it is the same pastel pink as the pastel pink/pastel yellow set, but that set only comes with a left joycon
[4:44:20] OJ_Hype: there is no right pastel pink joycon available
[4:44:28] xMrBackStabx: @Mortiie_ Lunaris has a passive skill called Antigravity which increases your carrying capacity as well, +80 at level 1 and they stack
[4:44:36] Sne4ky79: hopefully news of switch 2 soon
[4:44:46] OJ_Hype: theres also a neon pink set thats been around forever
[4:45:03] xMrBackStabx: @befrosty7 Any chance you have a base at 191, -38? That's the only farm base I have and I never run out of ore

[5:24:25] Taylor131313: WFire
[5:24:26] jikki_: but heat and cold is sometimes important
[5:24:32] Worker_Drone: there are cold and hot zones that need different armor
[5:24:38] Jegawuffle: Typically in this genre, when you get wiped out in an attack you start back at the start and need to build back from scratch (but keep level and recipes)
[5:24:45] Collnaris: i think they took ideas from many games and combined it
[5:24:45] notdustinx: also effects your eggs too what environment they are in
[5:24:51] wesjer250: heat hurts really hard
[5:24:53] drzaius31: anniesBlind
[5:24:53] Elias_Age: Losing all 5 pals when dying on hard mode is pretty hardcore, need to build your party and pray for luck in towers so guy there will not be full anti-elemental
[5:24:57] wesjer250: without heat armor
[5:24:57] Collnaris: yes
[5:25:08] notdustinx: scorching eggs hatch faster in hot environment
[5:25:09] PirateCaptainEtc: yeah you can actually respawn in a cold or hot environment
[5:25:11] notdustinx: for example
[5:25:14] Collnaris: you heat and cool eggs for how they hatch
[5:25:22] PirateCaptainEtc: they dont let you pick to start there, but you can just die and respawn there for a different starting area
[5:25:23] Krimsonyx: how's the view though?
