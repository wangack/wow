[1:08:54] CoffeeASAP: @Luxthos I started messing around with warrior and I keep forgetting to activate my stances, do you have any plans to add a stance/buff indicator to the wa? Or is it already available and I'm just not seeing it?
[1:09:04] Vizho_: How come you wanna stack vers and not mastery? Doesn't mastery increase the dmg of ur pets/minions?
[1:09:24] RPG_GANGSTER: both.
[1:09:54] SylarSavage: If you buy the war within epic edition you get dragonflight included
[1:10:04] SylarSavage: and thats roughly 80 to 90 bucks and get a ton of stuff included in it
[1:10:12] RPG_GANGSTER: thanks lux.
[1:10:35] misomander: its because the tier set damage scales off crit and versa
[1:10:37] misomander: and not mast
[1:11:14] Vizho_: Ahh thanks! I used to play Affli and there you wanna stack mastery so was confused about Demo

[1:13:05] SylarSavage: Stats aren't gonna massively decrease your damage. Sure it'll make a difference but it's not gonna be like 60k dps change
[1:13:10] Vizho_: peepoSad as a former affli main that hurt
[1:13:30] SylarSavage: But that's not 60k lol
[1:13:43] SylarSavage: No, it definitely matters

[2:10:44] Gummybeard1: water
[2:10:54] felianos: stomach bug?
[2:10:55] Voidthos: We ALL have the shits at the same time
[2:11:05] Gummybeard1: the country you live in
[2:11:10] RalgorStreams: water or airborne
[2:11:36] Voidthos: I'll have to do some research
[2:11:38] RalgorStreams: or water and proximity transfer, touch etc.
[2:11:51] Peanutbeards: When it comes to the corporate side of business it always comes down to the money and less on the product. But I still think Metzen involved is better than not
[2:12:07] RalgorStreams: New Hunter DOT : MultiShit
[2:15:06] Peanutbeards: @Voidthos Did you try not drinking from the dog/cat bowls?

[2:20:05] Masqerader: so u wanna make a wall with roots, and prolong the boss burn phase
[2:20:41] RalgorStreams: all i run is 18-20 so I usually am not getting punished too hard for mechanics. I really haven't run everbloom that much
