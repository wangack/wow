[0:14:53] smitesucks: 93 dps and 2 dannycarrys at the top of shuffle ladder every other healer might as well quit the game

[0:15:17] nikthevoker: that happens to me alot with hover coming out of cc
[0:15:18] MongoSecurity: We are warming up it's all good lol

[0:16:10] Koraszdormu: Ranging the communion.  Feelsbadman
[0:16:24] smitesucks: @Paradox9 yet he will go on the forums and trash talk healers for wanting fair mmr
[0:16:26] smitesucks: he deserves it
[0:16:51] Koraszdormu: Would have been a win if the lock hadn't ranged communion.
[0:17:23] smitesucks: 2.7+ is 93 dps players and danny carrys 2 healers
[0:17:37] DegStaerian: good afternoon from across the sea
[0:18:57] Judgejobrown: whats that little glowing green dragon weakaura youve got?
[0:19:18] joyrex_j9: I think it matters because of queues

[0:19:25] smitesucks: why would a healer that is a real 2.4 player ever que shuffle instead of rerolling dps
[0:19:31] buffnac: im just confused why brackets dont inflate the same way
[0:19:38] seanwheeler823: think he means healer mmr is lower maybe?
[0:20:32] Sosatko: is the season even still that deflated?  aren’t people 3k now lol
[0:20:33] smitesucks: only rank 1 titles are based on role. A bunch of healers can't get 2.4 on healer but they can reroll dps and get it why wouldnt they do that
[0:20:58] buffnac: in 3's they are shuff has been stuck 2.7 at the top for what seems like half the season
[0:21:09] DegStaerian: give the ret some sunspots
[0:21:44] NightMunchies: Morning Ven good to see ya:-)
[0:22:06] joyrex_j9: its a cycle where most healers get to 2400 and stop so if you play above that rating you're usually just gifting MMR to someone
[0:23:02] NightMunchies: pretty much
[0:23:19] joyrex_j9: unless you just completely crush the enemy healer, which is possible but it's not like you have that much control in that situation as a the healer anyway
[0:23:41] famous1939: this song will always remind me of rush hour
[0:23:49] NightMunchies: lol i agree
[0:23:57] nikthevoker: i dont even remember qqueueing last night but my shuffle rating went up, so guess it went well LUL
[0:24:35] StromicusRex: ah, its the "i'm back in my childhood home's pool on a hot summer day" playlist
[0:24:39] NightMunchies: nice Nik might of had to many wobbly pops to remember
[0:25:05] zerx_gg: xdx
[0:25:14] NightMunchies: musta been a good night if u cant remember
[0:25:20] nikthevoker: rush hour
[0:25:23] Judgejobrown: gorgonite scum
[0:25:24] damptowell: Small Soldiers
[0:25:26] nikthevoker: best movie
[0:25:26] koonakeenay: got my legendary yesterday, 70 more feathers x.x and then on to the next phase of bs lol
[0:25:30] MongoSecurity: Small soldiers yep
[0:25:35] famous1939: small soldiers a low key great movie
[0:25:35] damptowell: great vidya game too
[0:25:45] nikthevoker: ya but RUSH HOUR LUL
[0:25:45] joyrex_j9: it's just the same fundamental issue that shuffle has always had, right? healer gains are based on the enemy healer only and dps gains are based on round-by-round comparisons against varied MMRs of enemy DPS
[0:25:46] Judgejobrown: tommy lee jones as the main soldier dude. just oot good
[0:25:47] NightMunchies: Grats Koona!
[0:25:51] FlyFYI: just watched that yesterday lol

[0:26:15] wackpoetic: I am 100% on board with you venruki that seasons should be ranked like bronze/silver/gold/plat/etc and be participation rewards. I think they should also do PvP templates to increase participation
[0:26:24] MongoSecurity: Yeah we have heavy smoke and the air quality sucks haha.

[2:27:47] zerx_gg: thoughts on carbonated water
[2:27:48] hamsti: anyone that gets an adjustable rate is just desperation mode
[2:27:51] MaximumnNeo: rates are expected to go down by end of year at least in Canada, i cant wait
[2:27:52] FromenguardTV: It's like calling every dessert cake
[2:27:55] NovaSun84: Is that why they simplify it that poorly?  lizzKEKW
[2:27:57] MaximumnNeo: my mortgage payment is outrageous\
[2:28:03] FromenguardTV: I understand referring to cola flavored things as coke/pepsi though
[2:28:06] heymomimonttv: @hamsti no, it's usually people who know they're gonna move in 2-3 years
[2:28:14] BMaStream: @venruki what's your favorite coke?
[2:28:19] hamsti: I guess that makes sense
[2:28:20] americanmoses18: if you drink la croix ur a psycho....id like a drink that tastes like a hint of a hint of lemon

[2:29:09] zerx_gg: shaweeeeesh
[2:29:10] hamsti: Still crazy. It seems so insane to me that in Canada my mortgage payment could go up compared to when i bought it
[2:29:11] wreklol: i want to be clear. if you drink mountain dew code red still, you deserve prison time
[2:29:11] MaximumnNeo: love me some caanda dry

[2:30:14] Acurarx: capitalism baby!
[2:30:21] jukeandnuke: monk the new dh?
[2:30:24] NightMunchies: la la la la la la
[2:30:28] jmaclicious_: that’s why they use to do stress tests and you stay within realistic budget. buying when interest rates were at 1-1.5% thinking they could afford it but didn’t learn anything from history when rates went to 18% mind you houses were cheaper when that happened.
[2:30:29] heymomimonttv: 4 monk, 2 lock. wtaf
[2:30:30] aultymalganis: that warlock on your team throws :/

[2:31:16] NovaSun84: alannamRiot Nerf monks, this lobby indicates a true problem with the game
[2:31:22] MongoSecurity: lmao this lobby is actually balanced
[2:31:26] MaximumnNeo: @hamsti honestly if that happened i think the government would have to cap rates and look at other policies for fiscal/monetary policy.
[2:31:29] NightMunchies: get no satisfaction  rolling stones
[2:31:33] MaximumnNeo: 10% would bankrup half the countries homeowners
[2:31:47] hamsti: ya literally like 50% of homeowners with mortgages wouldn't be able to make payments
[2:32:04] jmaclicious_: they wouldn’t care. the banks win either way. you default your mortgage they get your house, you pay it they get  nearly double the value in interest lmao.

[2:32:41] jmaclicious_: 5.6 is a great rate right now.
[2:32:45] NightMunchies: like a pipefitter or Havac
[2:32:51] americanmoses18: poop butt balls @novasun84
[2:32:51] MaximumnNeo: but 10% i would probably just bury myself in the back yard and start haunting people
[2:32:52] MaximumnNeo: lol
[2:32:54] JmanOwnz: this is the first season i gave up on my ww....just aint fun no more

[2:35:45] stilljane: people get heat stroke here when its 85 F out....it shocked me

[2:38:49] NightMunchies: ski jacket ski-doo
[2:38:50] stilljane: its still crazy how people just are okay with wearing thick ass layers, shoveling snow, and picking ice off the car.  like this is normal for people???? im still shook

[6:19:18] Somanie: "accident" Kappa
[6:19:19] stealthwalker99: I wonder if the ddos is from then not nerfing dh
[6:19:23] Time_Limits: everything's DH do is by accident
[6:19:23] Badasti: your defensives are giga strong, you accidentally heal yourself all game pmuch

[6:19:31] SteLawBro: All the DH's in here who cant break 1600 on it are crying right now.
[6:19:36] jporter_: damn 2v2 got to 33% dhs
[6:19:36] notoriousztv: big ddos attack
[6:19:42] NightMunchies: they clipped dh's wings thats why servers are bonkers
[6:19:50] leeka: https://twitter.com/dipicat1/status/1762952018006786290

[6:20:04] markeexy: is servers fixed lads
[6:20:06] Badasti: oh look im passively cleaving the shit out of their team lel
[6:20:06] stealthwalker99: my shuffle is unplayable
[6:20:08] zachgamegodx: they became infinitely better also with 2 minute meta since meta makes them immune to cc for the animation and ofc its meta
[6:20:11] NightMunchies: good they need to be 1 shotted
[6:20:27] NightMunchies: god
[6:20:38] GLYFEnation: How bored can you be to Ddos World of Warcraft a 20 year old game lol?
[6:20:43] Badasti: clone should either have a cd or be dispellable

[6:21:11] fatlittlepaypig: ddos Sadge
[6:21:16] SteLawBro: Too bad its not closer to april 1st because it would have been a great joke to have a long list of pvp changes and then "DH - No changes needed".
[6:21:18] Badasti: dh cleave should be separated in the tree same as other classes
[6:21:23] LiLb444: They have so many things that do damage its wild
[6:21:24] jporter_: remove the passive magic resist
[6:21:26] Idgtst: them taking like 12% less magic damage might be a good place to start too
[6:21:29] FateIRL: remove 20% magic wall, remove cleansed by flame, nerf overall damage by 20%. reduce leech by 50%.
[6:21:30] trollmasta66: Meta is internet dif right now
[6:21:35] NightMunchies: even DDOS attck
[6:21:52] NightMunchies: hunka bunka
[6:22:14] Badasti: no class needs ms with current mobility imo
[6:22:14] zachgamegodx: remove demo MS
[6:22:15] Cerbzz: MS shouldn't even be in the game IMO
[6:22:19] zachgamegodx: never allow casters to team up
[6:22:45] zachgamegodx: ook dipiu
[6:22:46] Badasti: why is a warrior doing top dam and reducing healing by 25-50% in at least half the games they play
[6:22:47] TheNutcracka: let me guess dipi plays shaman LUL
[6:22:47] twinbladeuk: who is this guy? KEKW
[6:22:51] zachgamegodx: gouge andkidney?!
[6:22:51] FateIRL: gouge needs to be removed
[6:22:55] SteLawBro: "Total revamp or bandaid"...Theres a lot of room in between there..lol
[6:22:57] drdoomkinx: kidney should be 30 atleast
[6:22:58] Bwrecker: sounds good to me haha

[6:23:29] jondoe2239: @zachgamegodx yea its great on healers
[6:23:30] armin_ed: Uhhh as a ret I would also like MS like his notes for Enhance/DK KEKW
[6:23:35] Axtin: i think precog should be 2 seconds
[6:23:35] ram13ll: they are fine..they can still die,,you have to be very good to be OP
[6:23:39] zerx_gg: leeka CAUGHT
[6:23:39] SteLawBro: The compensation is that they are balanced after you take that all away.
[6:23:43] Badasti: no buffs for frost / fire,,,
[6:23:45] qkmood: 2s alter NO BIAS HERE
[6:23:49] leeka: @zerx_gg :o
[6:23:49] Badasti: peoples opinions on mages are cooked
[6:23:50] zachgamegodx: @Axtin true
[6:23:56] foxyllama: ignore leeka, he mains demo
[6:24:11] leeka: @foxyllama :(
[6:24:13] zachgamegodx: alter time shouldnt be dispellable

[6:24:27] thasthebear: LUL
[6:24:28] FateIRL: hgihly skilled
[6:24:28] BanthaBantha: 4 peice is the fun part of destro, I think it’s more immo shadowburn and the passive haste buffs from immo
[6:24:34] zachgamegodx: blink stun removed, alter T undispellable
[6:24:34] emergence_fi: CiGrip
[6:24:40] jondoe2239: shouldnt be able to get precog procs while already precog'd
[6:24:46] smokechiefx: Um have you ever played DH? Thats a real skill spec
[6:24:49] leeka: alter time was a buff into teams with dispell though
[6:25:00] drdoomkinx: just remove MS
[6:25:04] jondoe2239: make it a pvp talent again too so people actually have to give something up to take it
[6:25:08] twinbladeuk: SO TRUE
[6:25:11] jondoe2239: right now its a no brainer for any caster or healer
[6:25:13] twinbladeuk: REMOVE MORTAL STRIKE
[6:25:14] jondoe2239: theres no other option
[6:25:15] Somanie: strimmer has opinion Madge
[6:25:20] FateIRL: look at fotm warriors are 2nd
[6:25:22] williwhite94: hell yeah
[6:25:23] FateIRL: LUL
[6:25:23] flames222: warriors feel pretty good
[6:25:24] twinbladeuk: war is dead Sadge
[6:25:26] Badasti: arms one of the most represented dps specs
[6:25:27] galadice: no they are not
[6:25:28] bogei: feral should be tankier
[6:25:28] wackpoetic: Spell Casters should all lose Mortal Strike, it should be physical damage only to promote melee/caster comps
[6:25:28] BrewCral: no but hunters are LUL
[6:25:29] spellgunx: WARRIORS ARE OK
[6:25:30] dkoiking: ded
[6:25:31] notoriousztv: p sure magnus is #1 on the 2s ladder as a warr
[6:25:32] gdodmebxu: @xaryuisweak play a mage KEKW
[6:25:34] armin_ed: All warriors are playing DH so yes
[6:25:34] hawgcast: BUFF ALL MS, REMOVE HEALERS FROM GAME
[6:25:34] spellgunx: not good not bad
[6:25:35] jporter_: no war is great, but why play war when you can dh
[6:25:37] FateIRL: warriors 2nd most played class in the game behind dh,
[6:25:39] Mechgyrasaur: warr is a walmart dh right now
[6:25:41] repsac1442: warrior is in a good spot
[6:25:47] FateIRL: ele needs a mortal strike
[6:25:54] jporter_: flameshock ms please
[6:25:55] zachgamegodx: give everything but ret mortal strike - dipi
[6:25:58] SteLawBro: Screw it, everyone gets a mortal strike.
[6:25:59] Badasti: wallmart dh is still better than most classes
[6:25:59] amSLC: I wish feral could do more in bear form. And be a little more tanky
[6:26:03] NerdEngineering: warrior is good in certain comps
[6:26:10] NerdEngineering: DH is good in every comp
[6:26:11] zerx_gg: frostbolt should apply a 90% mortal strike effect
[6:26:13] Ryan_Gilbert: well ive seen team disconnect and ive disconnected out of 5 shuffles in a row healing ... the dos is real
[6:26:15] notoriousztv: should increase dh ms to 75%
[6:26:20] repsac1442: I think sub is down bad atm
[6:26:22] NerdEngineering: its that min/max mentality you touched on in a recent vid
[6:26:23] foxyllama: rsham should prob earth ele im sry
[6:26:23] hawgcast: NERF DDOS, TOO STRONG
[6:26:24] Axtin: @xaryuisweak stop yappin
[6:26:24] williwhite94: they fr need to nerf the fuck out of DHs tho lol
[6:26:29] gdodmebxu: @xaryuisweak he plays warrior
[6:26:31] jporter_: whats the AWC schedule this weekend ven?
[6:26:33] danielbanks: Give ret ms
[6:26:39] Badasti: @xaryuisweak you should play a mage i wanna see it
[6:26:40] Somanie: ppl can't have opinions Madge
[6:26:41] zachgamegodx: warrior has the upperhand vs mages @xaryuisweak
[6:26:41] zerx_gg: xddtalk
[6:26:42] armin_ed: @danielbanks Facts
[6:26:43] slinger_007: DDoSattack
[6:26:43] whensmoko: @Axtin foreals haha
[6:26:45] spellgunx: whose burner is xaryuisweak
[6:26:46] gdodmebxu: @Badasti he'd be stuck 1200
[6:26:46] Somanie: how dare you think Madge
[6:26:47] repsac1442: everything has a counter except dh lol
[6:26:54] zerx_gg: its his 6th burner spellgunx
[6:26:55] notoriousztv: a ddos attack? ive never seen that lol
[6:27:00] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Why does wow get ddosed so much? Someone really hates blizzard because those botnets are expensive
[6:27:01] SteLawBro: Any spec that has a counter is unplayable right now.
[6:27:04] qkmood: cant imagine why
[6:27:06] brewtank: “randomly”
[6:27:08] Somanie: what a fucking walnut
[6:27:08] zerx_gg: bro im tempted
[6:27:08] brewtank: KEKW
[6:27:11] ferahgok: @xaryuisweak yikes
[6:27:13] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[6:27:14] Somanie: actual walnut
[6:27:17] Kymagez: bro
[6:27:17] zerx_gg: lets poll it xdd
[6:27:23] Axtin: @xaryuisweak is like those people that record themselves getting arrested as a flex
[6:27:23] Hobblefoot: I mean when you have a troll name you are likely to do troll things I would imagine.
[6:27:25] zachgamegodx: think he meant do instead of so
[6:27:27] Kymagez: im not your bro
[6:27:28] raceyg: mod him
[6:27:30] spellgunx: nice dipi wishlist, no frost or fire mage buff when its bad in 3s
[6:27:35] foxyllama: xaruisweak is a xaru mod
[6:27:40] peeachy8: bnet crashed?
[6:27:42] Z00preme: I haven't banned someone in a while, I do it! rukiParty
[6:27:44] spellgunx: dipi is a good player but he has the most awful takes
[6:27:45] zachgamegodx: @Axtin they're defending their rights
[6:27:51] jporter_: no and no
[6:27:52] zerx_gg: you can do it Z00preme
[6:27:54] Kymagez: @Z00preme get em
[6:27:54] qkmood: ill take +50% on frostbolt why not
[6:27:55] zerx_gg: the honour is yours my g
[6:28:02] Somanie: looook if you need someone banned--
[6:28:04] demonwomb: Honest question, has Xaryu been to AWC? I think he is a VERY good mage.
[6:28:05] brewtank: @venruki I miss frost mage and UA were the cool and fun specs in arena now they are so lame and bad lol
[6:28:24] demonwomb: before that?
[6:28:26] LiLb444: Xar also doesn't compete like that
[6:28:29] gdodmebxu: @BigHawkWoW HUHH
[6:28:34] zerx_gg: shit cumpony dog hit fuk gobbles
[6:28:35] williwhite94: yep its beena year lol and he doesnt like competition
[6:28:36] zerx_gg: xdx
[6:28:38] brewtank: KEKW
[6:28:41] NerdEngineering: Xar is like a college sports player, he's awesome until you see him go against pros.
[6:28:46] qkmood: @demonwomb No, he's good but ladder and tourny are diff beasts
[6:28:47] spellgunx: frost mage damage is a joke
[6:28:48] brewtank: they need more splash damage Kappa
[6:28:48] demonwomb: that being said you are a VERY good mage too @venruki .
[6:28:48] gdodmebxu: @BigHawkWoW HUHH HUHH HUHH
[6:28:52] jondoe2239: he never competed because he lives in AZ,  theres something weird in AWC rules about state youre from
[6:28:52] obviouslytai: ice lance needs no ring of fire and ice lance dam. i said it
[6:28:55] spellgunx: fire needs help too
[6:28:56] dkoiking: Feral needs saving
[6:28:57] ram13ll: I feel like every spec should be where Destro is... powerfull but killable
[6:29:04] Idgtst: i think xar used to do wargames to help people practice, but don't think he's ever competed
[6:29:05] Kymagez: @zerx_gg where are you from?
[6:29:07] gdodmebxu: Blizzard duck my socks u are so shit cumpony dog hit fuk gobbles
[6:29:13] dakila24: if you get off a frost bomb icelance combo in 2024, they deserve to die lmao
[6:29:13] zerx_gg: blizzard duck my socks xdx
[6:29:14] gussetaf: id rather have frost bolt dmg than ice lance tbh
[6:29:14] Z00preme: Good to see you to man! Been doing life, recovering some health issues (all good now) - Retired wow gamers and soon to be dad in may!
[6:29:15] Kymagez: gobbies monkaHmm
[6:29:15] Badasti: remove glacial and buff frost bolt and lance dam to compensate + a little extra to keep up with the rest of the classes in the game
[6:29:18] zachgamegodx: im not so sure about ice lance buff, frost bolt could use one but lances have a pretty wide range with the top end being pretty high for me at least
[6:29:19] LiLb444: I hate that it has to function with frost bomb
[6:29:20] dakila24: glacial*
[6:29:20] zachgamegodx: like 130-140k
[6:29:20] chubmax: that wishlist needs aff buffs
[6:29:20] LokixSun: ray of frost hurts
[6:29:21] brewtank: @nerdengineering he could have but never did. there were rules for AZ awhile ago which played a role
[6:29:23] zerx_gg: Belgium @Kymagez
[6:29:29] jporter_: curious how differnet the meta will be if dh do get tuned and cant run down every caster doing 100k
[6:29:30] Magottx: single target UA just needs to pump
[6:29:35] Kymagez: and gobbies mean bj there to?
[6:29:46] zerx_gg: we dont speak english here
[6:29:48] zerx_gg: so probably not
[6:29:53] gdodmebxu: @BigHawkWoW HUHH HUHH HUHH
[6:29:54] Kymagez: oh lol
[6:29:54] dryangore: I wish aff had something similar to decimating bolt back (maybe  not as big but one drain soul that had a bit of st burst every min would be nice)
[6:30:00] leeka: :(
[6:30:04] brewtank: peace
[6:30:05] LiLb444: Take it easy homie
