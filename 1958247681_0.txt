[0:49:17] Niksen_99: I only finished campaign back on launch then quit.. Now im back :D
[0:50:24] mezza77: I did the campaign when the game first came out and haven't played it since, do I need to go through it again in season 2?
[0:50:31] Minmatar0: The leveling grind was too much for my from 70+. Im so happy they increased leveling speed this season.

[0:51:50] MFAM_d3montyme: towHAMUP
[0:51:58] DeborahAnn45: i read a leak that said that blizz wont make new expacs but instead gonna make major patches for 10.x and they will be paid dlc's
[0:52:18] Minmatar0: Not really interested in farming uber bosses if i dont need the uniques.
[0:52:45] kekwmax: rumble when?
[0:53:12] DraulTheVikingFox: im doing a lazy companion crone staff build. basically no core skill. hold m1 and win.
[0:53:58] falldrgn: has anything been remotely close?
[0:54:15] Niksen_99: Maybe the leaks are mid but actually release will be the bomb
[0:54:35] mezza77: There's always one leak that comes out a day or two before that has a lot right
[0:55:30] Minmatar0: im tired of new content replacing old content making the old obsolete. the WoW expansion model annoys me. i like what New world did. Add but dont take away
[0:55:31] zskwahd: You do know whirlwind is the worse build for. Barbe in game rn right
[0:55:40] zskwahd: It did not go well w the nerfs and patch

[0:56:51] DeborahAnn45: they can make the raid relevant again
[0:56:55] Ttofinator: @DeborahAnn45 classic and Wrath is WOW retail i dno anybody playing it
[0:57:03] DraulTheVikingFox: i was hearing throne and liberty might launch soon?
[0:57:17] Niksen_99: The wow story is so deep after 20 years LUL Should probably hard reset 1 day
[0:57:49] DeborahAnn45: i think morgan said they have tools now that make it very easy to tune old raids
[0:58:30] Minmatar0: Well you could add in weekly quests that add zones, dungeons and battlegrounds onto a weekly playlist with increased rewards.

[0:59:41] Minmatar0: I dont think it would work for raiding. maybe LFR.
