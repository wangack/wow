[0:44:50] 91Niki: The thing is though, some chain restaurants websites are different from country to country. Not to mention, like in Denmark we don't even have their KFC app. So that might be what the issue comes down to, in terms of global promotion ijpSHRUG

[0:50:52] abracka_: wonder if they scrapped it to pull people to work on the survival mmo game they're developing
[0:52:57] 91Niki: @Shrenko Saying it's cancelled is spreading misinformation. Saying it isn't what the promised is a better way to go. It's okay to be upset about the outcome, but don't just say that pve is cancelled

[0:56:45] Vivelli: yea sucks they cancelled hero mode and the talent system. was lookin forward to it
[0:57:10] 91Niki: @Shrenko I agree, it's a shitty way of handling things. The lack of transparency with the community, the backtracking on content that they wanted to do.
[0:57:36] meroxzx: blizzard preaty much sayd they cant handle the work on OW2 pve stuff and desited to give us bits of pve

[1:20:51] Griff2615: miss the good old days where healers healed, tanks tanked, and DPS bitched about heals and aggro.
[1:20:51] Aquadriel: maybe dps should do better
[1:20:53] BoezIRL: does holy do damage?
[1:20:57] Prisana: if you aint top dps as heals you doing it wrong
[1:20:58] t_train_va: Healers not DPSing sounds like the argument over in 14
[1:21:00] kissesaurus: @tylerwithghosts fist weaving used ot be so good

[1:31:42] vulkankragon: what i don't understand is why are ppl still pugging in wow. blizzard has made abundantly clear that their design philosophy is aimed at guilds and tight knit communities.
[1:31:52] Samurai3434: Then he raged in chat "How are you surviving!?"  "Bro. He's the Tank"

[1:33:26] BoezIRL: if that was the case why do lfr and lfg exists?
[1:33:29] captain_khyzan: pugging can be way easier then progging in guild with bads... if ur pug is bad u jump out and into a new 1...
[1:33:35] firewalltwitch: @RenjiTV yep
[1:33:42] TweektheProphet: i think if anything Blizzard has some what de-incentived guilds

[2:03:43] 91Niki: @firewalltwitch Considering they have seasons, and battlepass, I think it's a lot more likely to see returns of classes from previous Diablo games. It can only be in their interest to attrack players as much as possible to buy their battlepasses in the future. Introducing classes together with that and new season, is a great way for players to return
