[1:36:24] realnzall: Your mom was happy with my 2 inches last night, @mytherel ... Oh wait
[1:36:26] casualboomer: The issue isn't being on our own grid. At all. It's that the singular regulatory agency over our grid made winterizing power generation equipment optional.
[1:36:28] cr1msonshade: 2 inches in a state that usually only gets surface frost can wreck your world
[1:36:36] Kromede: you can do a Ted Cruz thing and cruise to mexico Kappa

[1:37:06] casualboomer: @Kromede you have no idea how happy it makes me that my senator was stupid enough to do that shit. We finally have a good shot at getting him out of office.
[1:37:10] br0therbrian: shits on fire now shits frozen worlds ending confirmed
[1:37:12] Kriven: @Towelliee is Logic's GFuel flavor tasty? I liked Fazeberry

[1:38:01] casualboomer: @Kromede to be fair, he's been pretty awful the entire time. But he has his moments of not being a complete jackass.
[1:38:02] mrniceguy817: Lived in Fort Worth my whole life that was the most snow I’ve ever seen we had 2 foot swells on the side of the house
[1:38:06] mrpresbaby: need a tank @Towelliee

[1:40:28] Erielle04: will there be playable demo's ?
[1:40:28] br0therbrian: or 60
[1:40:30] vybetribe: yeah if people wanna stay in classic and farm they should be rewarded
[1:40:37] cr1msonshade: @magemyway thanks we did. Got lucky and live near a medical center so was excluded from any blackouts. Had a few house guests though lol.
[1:40:37] Strasne: it depends how they update the servers to TBC ones
[1:40:56] fewyn: i borrowed gold from a friend to get epic ground mount skill the day before TBC launched
[1:40:59] D3m0nHunt3r666: just cap the gold they are taking :P
[1:40:59] Clawanorder: I saw that you made a guild but I didnt check which faction. Are you rolling alliance in TBC this time around as well?
[1:41:01] Roffasauras: just be a druid Kappa
[1:41:05] Strasne: EVERYONE had the 60% flying the second they hit 60
[1:41:09] Kromede: flying in TBC=kill Illidan Kappa
[1:41:15] dimofodi: Flying was the first thing you did after dinging in BC and WoTLK.
[1:41:16] br0therbrian: 60 % Kappa
[1:41:19] Strasne: then did skettis dailies for the rest
[1:41:29] jasperboy: 90% of the gold on classic is RMT tho
[1:41:32] LSBreed: are there going to be servers where you start at 1?
[1:41:38] idenkaz_: @cr1msonshade who came to visit? Kappa glad all is good man!
[1:41:41] D3m0nHunt3r666: Mankrik
[1:41:42] Broomba: @Towelliee -- i have the player who used an inappropriate word during the LFR last fri/sat when you terry and rev ran Nath Castle if you need to make the necessary steps to let blizzard handle them.
[1:41:43] Frank4LuLz: dad server
[1:41:48] PokerFaceMoose: Could go to a Low pop server
[1:41:48] metavahn231: its gonna be so chill on alliance lol

[1:42:00] Rippan: true
[1:42:03] jasperboy: people have several chars with goldcap
[1:42:05] Strasne: when TBC came out, they released a bunch of fresh servers

[1:42:22] Panasonic82: Do you know if you can watch Blizzconline free, or do one have to pay? Their site is sooo confusing
[1:42:23] Mogwaimonk: just like alliance shaman had to lvl from 1

[1:43:05] TheItalianStallion321: if you make a horde BE paladin, yes you will be starting at 1
[1:43:08] LSBreed: can you race change/ transfer in classic?
[1:43:08] Kosmeros: There is a reason we get new classes in pre patch nowadays
[1:43:09] peinen: imagine wanting to continue to play classic, and farm world buffs for years rather than rolling over into TBC
[1:43:09] HaloS23: @Panasonic82 its free
[1:43:09] Selivar23: @Deathvoid80 source?

[1:44:18] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee whether or not in guild rather join that horde server.
[1:44:22] peinen: @Srky91 imagine caring about that when classic has basically the same issue
[1:44:26] Loftineer: anyone think WW monk will get nerfed? heard they are super strong
[1:44:37] Reinkaos999: what if I want to play blood elf?
[1:44:38] Clicklesly: They might make some fresh servers still?
[1:44:48] Srdjan91: saw some ppl will buy golds from gold cappers in tbc
[1:44:53] fatalityphase: if you're playing draenei or blood elf, might as well wait until tbc comes out
[1:44:54] Havykk: thats what I thought too
[1:44:55] Nerendis: What up T man
[1:44:55] Bartillo: I think they will release some fresh servers

[1:45:02] Shrenko: they are adding fresh servers arent they

[3:25:01] akia03: purple death smoke
[3:25:02] remedyt: janna fight 2.0
[3:25:04] whiskybae: She would do transformations like Frieza.
[3:25:05] daearthchild: What about your command table
[3:25:06] yshtola1337: i just want her to be a high elf again
[3:25:07] Ezekyler: she will be screeching all time and protected by a legion of simps
[3:25:13] Naturalbeef: Nathanos will be with her
[3:25:16] DudeThatsDope: Sylvanas is MY QUEEN
[3:25:17] raldrik: someones getting chained up in that encounter. It will be the BDSM raid
[3:25:17] ikzilion_xiv: with kaelthas
[3:25:18] Doomster59: f Sylvannas
[3:25:18] ZeethianDragon: I'm fucking tired of seeing her...
[3:25:20] Padarius: Slvanas is Slytherin, that ho has learned some different things in the dark arts
[3:25:25] Mecabeast: fateful encounter we get to kill blightcaller again
[3:25:25] OnexReaperx: banshee screams and plague bombs for days
[3:25:31] whiskybae: She's a strong wamen
[3:25:38] yshtola1337: redemptiona rc we find a way to revert her back to a high elf then as a reward allied race high elf :)
[3:25:39] Garrujak: A Sylvanas encounter would be a big cutscene where she destroys every strong character in the lore because horny incels love her character model
[3:25:42] idenkaz_: imo she the only character with an actual plot. she isnt boring like most characters.
[3:25:42] Lexi__Marie: Champion
[3:25:45] Redpandalol: nathanos gonna come out and fight you for insulting his queen
[3:25:48] Qargory: ill look at her all day long, she aint that bad lol

[3:25:52] Press_Escape: towQueen
[3:25:53] akia03: shes horde jaina
[3:25:54] DudeThatsDope: @magemyway agreed
[3:25:55] Animemron: Sylvanas has been messed up and evil ever since warcraft 3. No idea how people see any redeeming qualities in her
[3:25:58] ZeethianDragon: she is that bad
[3:26:10] SonofHorus82: I think her story should have ended with Wrath. That was the absolute logical stopping point.
[3:26:22] donpablo_98: spoilers haha
[3:26:23] Beyoga: She's like a worse Guldan. he never went away, but at least he was cool
[3:26:23] Taz_85: Got a feeling that the Jailer's holding Nathanos' soul hostage or something. Sylvanas might not even know he's dead
[3:26:23] Reddevc: EZ slave nathanos
[3:26:26] robbiev45: we haven't seen Nathanos since then right?
[3:26:27] yshtola1337: nathanos=jailor
[3:26:27] CptnOfCrunch: Shes a strong independent dead woman
[3:26:29] donpablo_98: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[3:26:31] JansonLives: plz no
[3:26:34] UHStorm: prolly KT too
[3:26:35] L4dy_Renegade: If they give Sylvanas a redemption arch, I'm to end up rolling my eyes so hard, they're going to pop out of my skull and roll down the street. NotLikeThis
[3:26:39] Taz_85: Jailer holding onto Nathanos' soul in case Sylvanas tries to screw him over
[3:26:41] CrunkyBrewster: I think Sylvanas got jealous of Evil Jaina back in MoP so she had to up her game
[3:26:41] lawles_walrus: is it safe to call nythanos a simp now Kappa ?
[3:26:48] Redpandalol: @Towelliee why does it seem like there was some jealousy in his voice when tyrande confront him. he goes "with him" like damn dude chill
[3:26:58] temp3st98: Probably in another shape aswell
[3:26:59] Garrujak: Inb4 she puts Nathanos in Anduin's body, just for him to still not sleep with her
[3:26:59] Ziyololx: we havent seen garrosh yet either
[3:27:01] yshtola1337: alleria is my favorite
[3:27:03] akia03: if jaina gets a redemption arc why wouldnt sylvanas?
[3:27:05] balanira: probably the mythic phase of sylvanas his simping
[3:27:10] Zettabyte: imagine having void problems...
[3:27:11] CrunkyBrewster: Tyr's hanging out in the throne room chillin
[3:27:12] Kinghorn: EZ Clap
[3:27:12] Taz_85: Fingers crossed for that time skimp when we return from Shadowlands
[3:27:15] Sonatta: i can't wait until we need Sylvanas to stop the void LUL
[3:27:17] Taz_85: skip, not skimp, heh
[3:27:23] ZeethianDragon: enough with the redepemption arch bs

[3:28:03] TiredCarcass: rocket yet?
[3:28:05] DrWafflesaurus: full simp mode
[3:28:08] CrunkyBrewster: im praying that in 9.05 they let us skip the Maw intro when we create a new character
[3:28:09] yshtola1337: i dont think we will even kill sylvanas i think my opinion andruin will somehow find a way to save her
[3:28:13] Sonatta: did she ever care?
[3:28:14] ProClicker: Velen who taught Anduin his light powers is chilling on the Spaceship
[3:28:14] whiskybae: never cared
[3:28:14] Todmeister9000: she has her new bf the Jailer now
[3:28:15] idenkaz_: Nathanos: i did everything for you towQueen lmao

[3:28:18] Doomster59: can't blame her PepeLaugh
[3:28:18] SeckSymbols: We aint killing Sylvanas
[3:28:20] whiskybae: he is a simp
[3:28:20] marineboi1288: maybe anduin and nathanos are with her like last boss is 3 bosses
[3:28:23] Ziyololx: @Towelliee they have a falling out in the latest book
[3:28:26] CrunkyBrewster: eh she used Nathanos
[3:28:30] akia03: but why did they show 5 covenant sets in the preview?
[3:28:32] ZeethianDragon: nathanos is lame asf
[3:28:33] Taz_85: Thought she was about to mention not being in control of who she loves or whatever in that cinematic with her and Anduin
[3:28:37] AngelDivRS: she just had war mode on thats all
[3:28:42] Taz_85: She didn't finish her sentence
[3:28:43] Garrujak: Oh so she feels about Nath the way we have felt about her for years of crappy lore?
[3:28:43] MOLAR305: "It's not you, It's me"
[3:28:44] Archiee: Sylvannas and Anduin gonna have a kid?
[3:28:46] MuttonChopins: she simpin for the jailer now
[3:28:51] Mecabeast: idk sylvanas cut her self off but it sounded like she was saying she couldn't even choose who she loved
[3:28:59] Redpandalol: Reduced the amount of enemies on multiple floors. HahaBall PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:29:06] Taz_85: @Mecabeast Thought that, too
[3:29:06] daearthchild: Or maybe part of her reception comes in to save her before you kill her
[3:29:11] Alienfromger: sylvana is even able to love? dont think so
[3:29:21] Beyoga: Do you think there's some bigger badder evil manipulating the Jailer?
[3:29:25] kappaday23: Kappa Kappa
[3:29:29] daearthchild: Redemption**
[3:29:33] CrunkyBrewster: I think a tiny little bit of her is capable o flove.. but its like for a second.
[3:29:52] L4dy_Renegade: imo, Sylvanas couldn't love anyone more than she loves herself.
[3:30:05] Balzofsteels: did you got the rocket finaly ??
[3:30:07] Lexi__Marie: i wish there was a list of known followers for each covenant
[3:30:07] SonofHorus82: I think my favorite Torghast combo is for Arms warrior/Venthyr. Condemn stun, no Condemn HP% limit, free rage powers for 90 seconds. Always great to have on the final floor.

[3:30:40] CrunkyBrewster: this would be Sylvanas's Cougar years
[3:30:52] idenkaz_: top notch
[3:30:57] ikzilion_xiv: Arduin will save her
[3:31:00] Ezekyler: everyone tilts her, the chick at Teldrassil, Saurfang, Anduin... she got some mental issues
[3:31:01] CrunkyBrewster: agreed on that
[3:31:05] LSBreed: maybe the jailer is holding nathanos....
[3:31:10] Zettabyte: why she mad? it's only a game Kappa
[3:31:15] L4dy_Renegade: I didn't know Anduin was into necrophilia. Kappa
[3:31:17] MuttonChopins: she got her fee fees hurt
[3:31:25] Reddevc: FeelsStrongMan WoW animation
[3:31:46] Broomba: grizzly hills
[3:31:50] Snappole_: what time is blizzcon?

[3:32:11] CrunkyBrewster: yeah good point
[3:32:13] MrGattz: less painful
[3:32:15] Trekxx: the choice
[3:32:17] lynxyy87: tank taht is
[3:32:17] Taz_85: The illusion of choice
[3:32:19] jsb5047: @Broomba Kreygasm
[3:32:20] Trekxx: which she never had
[3:32:23] CrunkyBrewster: oh righ tthe the choice
[3:32:25] ursinealli: She wants to give him the choice that Arthas didn't give her
[3:32:30] Zettabyte: meaningful choice Kappa
[3:32:30] George2001k: @towelliee stay tuned
[3:32:31] idenkaz_: she is very aware of what she is doing to him
[3:32:32] MrGattz: idk maybe. beats me
[3:32:32] Taz_85: Doesn't wanna accept that she's basically the same as Arthas now
[3:32:34] Garrujak: If you believe her crap lore, supposedly all she's ever wanted was choice
[3:32:34] Trekxx: towelliee she literaly said it
[3:32:35] Lazugo: because of the light @Towelliee the wants people that control the light
[3:32:35] Yiffy: it's easier probs
[3:32:39] lawles_walrus: maybe more powerful if he is willing?
[3:32:39] Epiclurker27893: those submit are slaves, those who are forced can resist and be saved
[3:32:40] Trekxx: she's giving anduin the choice she never had
[3:32:42] DrWafflesaurus: maybe it takes less focus to control him if he is willing to submit, so you can focus on other stuff
[3:32:43] CrunkyBrewster: its like her thing is well Arthas didnt give her a choice, so she's trying to do the same for Anduin
[3:32:43] Lazugo: the jailer **
[3:32:45] Sollice: Maybe he would be a stronger Lich King if he did it willingly
[3:32:45] BaldNed: More powerful when he freely leaves the Light
[3:32:51] AngelDivRS: a man chosses a slave obeys
[3:32:52] Redpandalol: easier to break everyone else if she shows that even anduin can give in
[3:32:52] Holysal: she hates hope so if they give up they also give up hope
[3:32:56] Capy_IRL: she is going to go from genocide to saint....how....blizzlogic
[3:32:58] MrGattz: she only burned down one tree, she might still have a soul
[3:33:12] bosseja: sup chat!
[3:33:14] satanic_viewer: i think the story is ass, and i found the content kinda repetitive, so I quit
[3:33:17] Mushythegoblin: I LOVE valheim
[3:33:17] lawles_walrus: maybe if he submits he is less likely to betray later on?
[3:33:18] Hascius: One tree with thousands of people in it :)
[3:33:19] Cyclodia: How long till opening blizzcon?
[3:33:22] lawles_walrus: i dunno its confusing
[3:33:22] L4dy_Renegade: @Roffasauras Manduin all heated looking at Sylvanas like " WHERE ARE THEY!? " lul
[3:33:24] CrunkyBrewster: I cant wait for the Gul'dan Redemption Arc Kappa
[3:33:29] tebbix: At what time is Blizzcon guys?
[3:33:32] Taz_85: Wonder if Anduin will go full shadow priest mode if he comes back from Shadowlands
[3:33:32] average_j4y: maybe there's a stronger bond if he submits rather than forced to
[3:33:34] FistoTheFistybot: Towelliee How come you switched to Kyrian for prot pala?
[3:33:34] watpuppy: 2pm PST

[3:34:07] Lorkass: 2 different shadowlands tho
[3:34:14] Mecabeast: sure would be nice if there was a countdown timer at the top left of the stream. otherwise I'll neeeever know when blizzcon is
[3:34:14] Ezekyler: Blizzard still holding the Arthas card under the sleeves @Towelliee
[3:34:17] xideontv: Guldan is Maldraxxus for sure, not Maw

[3:34:56] CrunkyBrewster: new Class!
[3:34:59] Redpandalol: @xideontv no way. he gets sent to the maw. they dont want him scheming
[3:35:04] Solid0Liquid: @towelliee maybe they used Varians soul in the mourne sword and for it to work Anduin has to willingly take the role of Lich king to control the scourge
[3:35:05] ikzilion_xiv: The grey force
[3:35:07] Ezekyler: he will come to our reality monkaS
[3:35:07] 0anobis6: What do you think the scorpion sting taste like? i was thinking of buying one.

[3:35:43] MuttonChopins: he saw he finally didnt cry this time
[3:35:51] CrunkyBrewster: yeah what happened to Wrathian. dude was around for a minute and then bounced out
[3:35:52] ProClicker: Velen would have been a better choice but he's chilling in space
[3:35:52] Archiee: YEEEAAAAHHHHYYYYAAAA
[3:35:53] Chilled_asiaaa: Hey towel ✨
[3:36:03] Huramz: thats how the jailer breaks free from the maw
[3:36:04] L4dy_Renegade: I'd laugh if all the dead Night Elves from Teldrassil's burning came back in the Shadowlands in their little wisp forms and go complete Archimonde on Sylvanas.
[3:36:07] bosseja: i need to know where arthas is duuude
[3:36:24] akia03: his dad :)
[3:36:24] redtemplar88: Ner'zhul?
[3:36:32] MrGattz: its gotta be guldan
[3:36:36] yshtola1337: oooh nice ff14 added lots of new stuff to do in last patch for next expansion
[3:36:36] SonofHorus82: I'm not sure if that's how the light works. For instance, even before getting Frostmourne, the light started to leave Arthas since he was doing some real shady shit (turning on the mercenaries).
[3:36:36] ninedraft317: the other part of uther
[3:36:39] tebbix: YEP this dude looks like Arthas, we got it
[3:36:40] idenkaz_: i hope they hold back with Arthas for now. god please blizz ..

[3:36:52] yshtola1337: 4 new dungeons and 2 new raids
[3:36:57] DrWafflesaurus: Gul'dan is like the new voldemort? can't get rid of him for like 7 expac
[3:36:57] George2001k: @towelliee DAMN, the soul on the shore is Varian! His own father!
[3:37:03] AngelDivRS: is n'zoth really dead?
[3:37:06] Aidler: Khadgar is in there
[3:37:06] akia03: varian would be best story wise

[3:37:19] xdunpealx: wrong.. Emperor Palpatine has been waiting
[3:37:24] CrunkyBrewster: yeah the helm was no longer in control of him
[3:37:27] bosseja: PepeHands
[3:37:38] redtemplar88: Arthas and Uther are going to help us save Anduin. Calling it now.
[3:37:38] Xailen: Arthas was forged into Anduins weapon, perhaps?
[3:37:38] L4dy_Renegade: towBolvar towBolvar towBolvar
[3:37:41] CrunkyBrewster: but at the same time, he knew he was being controlled. so he let it happen in a sense
[3:37:45] Sollice: @AngelDivRS Hope so. I think WoW has run its course with Old Gods. We can see Void Lords now
[3:37:45] ice_ross: arthas did nothing wrong
[3:37:50] The_Nameles: Its garrosh LUL
[3:37:52] George2001k: Varian as the Soul for the Sword!
[3:37:54] idenkaz_: yes please
[3:37:56] CrunkyBrewster: yeah
[3:38:02] Solid0Liquid: I asked the dev's about my theory after I saw the cinematics and then the FBI showed up at my house....coincidence?

[3:38:32] MOLAR305: watch this campaign include resuing arthas's soul and reuniting him with uther
[3:38:46] papaherc: maybe Anduin wanted this, so he can infiltrate and play both sides, but really on the light side
[3:38:49] MuttonChopins: Arthas, Uther , and the Morgraines help Anduin
[3:38:52] DudeThatsDope: ARTHAS FOREVER

[3:47:49] Taz_85: She can't be redeemed, but maybe she does screw over the Jailer somehow. Becomes the leader of a small hostile independent group of undead, opposite the Ebon Blade or something
[3:47:51] jasperboy: kill her, come back 3 times
[3:47:51] Sollice: She wont be able to die. She will be the only one to know the secrets of the jailer and how to kill him and we will need her for it
[3:47:54] Zettabyte: Sylvanas coming back as the leader of the Alliance towAlliance Kappa
[3:48:00] Taz_85: Survives for another couple of expansions
[3:48:02] Kromede: i love her story
[3:48:03] Roffasauras: it was only a minor setback
[3:48:11] MrGattz: she'll get sent to the void lands or something and thats the next xpac
[3:48:17] salozzz: i got love rocket today, couldn't believe it :D
[3:48:18] DudeThatsDope: Her lore is one of the best!
[3:48:19] Animemron: She killed too many to get redeemed tbh
[3:48:20] L4dy_Renegade: Sylvanas is Blizz's new mary-sue flavor of the last two expansions. I don't know if/when the novelty will wear off.
[3:48:25] Catspaw66: I could see Slyvanas and Tryande both end up killing each other . then in 3 expacs they both return
[3:48:38] Broomba: manchurian candidate
[3:48:47] rosina_scarlett: i'm just waiting for blizz to us the runecarver is the primus xD
[3:48:58] Sollice: Maybe we kill her AFTER Shadowlands have been restored to normal. Then she goes to the proper covenent
[3:49:04] SonofHorus82: what about the possibility, no matter how out of left field it could be, that we find that bit of her soul that Arthas held back in Frostmourne and then somehow bring her back to actual Elf life?
[3:49:05] Sollice: That way she is dead, but not really
[3:49:27] Kiddeath77: So who is the winter queen sister then?
[3:49:39] Gnral: starcraft 3 is possible
[3:49:40] Lexi__Marie: his channel means he's immune
[3:49:42] L4dy_Renegade: Hour of her third death, re-imagined.
[3:49:45] Sollice: @Kiddeath77 Eronar
[3:49:47] Darkest_Guy: !armory

[3:49:47] EarlofCockwood: @Towelliee is this event today the substitution Blizzcon from 2020 and in Novemeber there will be the next blizzcon?
[3:49:53] Capy_IRL: wonder if Helya will be a raid boss this time, since we saw here in the maw
[3:49:55] L4dy_Renegade: Even though she's on like her 5163567125th death.
[3:50:05] Korupcija_: do you take vivify trait when you do it on monk?
[3:50:14] SonofHorus82: @Kiddeath77 I think it's obviously Elune, based on the way she was talking about Ysera.
[3:50:19] MrGattz: @EarlofCockwood no, there wont be another blizcon this year
[3:50:28] MuttonChopins: usually 9.3 is like a art work drop
[3:50:29] Sollice: @SonofHorus82 No Elune is above Titans. She is talking about Eronar
[3:50:32] average_j4y: @Towelliee do you think this expansion will go on past the normal 2 year between?
[3:50:35] Lukenonwalker: last time it was a fish
[3:50:37] Kiddeath77: That what I thought
[3:50:42] Exikos: are we watching blizzconline here?
[3:50:47] Shredmuffn: i want them to tell us how they will transition from classic to tbc
[3:50:47] Sollice: Ardenweald is the sister realm to the Emerald Dream.
[3:50:52] Ekvision: I just read that Lula will be on blizcon with a cooking part to make a warpburger
[3:50:52] EarlofCockwood: @MrGattz oh really...ok
[3:50:57] Jack_Fatspack: you lost weight bruh?
[3:50:58] Zelium6: where is blizzcon streaming?
[3:51:09] crazywhiteman71: Hogger will be a new raid boss lol
[3:51:11] Nissaea: youtube? i thought
[3:51:11] Tru1485: but I can't read
[3:51:12] Exikos: w8 what u guys can read?
[3:51:14] Sollice: @crazywhiteman71 Right here on this channel
[3:51:17] Kromede: wake up 200IQ
[3:51:25] Alegnowar: 6 months from now there won't be anything to show to make another blizzcon worth they're time to set it up
[3:51:36] Ekvision: at 2 pm PST or 23.00 CET
[3:51:42] derry10: maybe that wasn't 9.1 and they leaked it to mess with your minds
[3:51:43] Kiddeath77: It’s like she had so much hatred for her sister
[3:51:44] EarlofCockwood: BibleThump no Blizzcon in novembre
[3:51:44] rosina_scarlett: whats your renown with kyrian since you swapped @Towelliee
[3:51:57] Slowtwitch: hey towerllie u still all wow
[3:52:04] rosina_scarlett: well damn
[3:52:12] RhadigarTV: Good morning @Towelliee and chat! Who's ready for BlizzCon!
[3:52:19] SonofHorus82: @Sollice That makes sense. Especially since it was the Titans that gave the Aspects their powers.
[3:52:20] Kromede: towerllie - thats a nice one KEKW
[3:52:25] Alegnowar: was that burger good?
[3:52:26] xluckydawgx: I feel like this might be the longest expansion we have ever had
[3:52:33] MrGattz: towelliee you watching the cooking stuff on stream to or nah?

[3:53:01] Kromede: damn i envy you
[3:53:01] zackmcquack: shit that looks good
[3:53:04] Sollice: Yep. I think Elune maybe an elder god, "First Ones" kind of thing. She and others sit above Titans. Shadowlands are death titans, the other titans we know are order titans
[3:53:07] PattyPoo13: Toweliee getting carried by Lula's cooking.
[3:53:15] wastedx3149: @mrgattz damn, not even some hints about it? lmao

[3:53:31] yoloswaglols: @Towelliee gz on Wentz, we will see if he will last a whole season
[3:53:31] average_j4y: @Towelliee do you think this expansion will go longer than the normal 2 years between?
[3:53:32] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee did u taste that hamburger bro??? :D
[3:53:32] SumZeroGG: Lula is awesome
[3:53:39] Slowtwitch: thats cool they gave her that opportunity
[3:53:43] Sollice: @Towelliee LOL Lula is the feast QUEEN in our raids too
[3:53:44] Fhirn: her dedication is paying off! good for her and her hard work she puts in

[4:24:16] MistaHat: @RhadigarTV I agree they need fresh classic servers because they will just have people going back to private servers to get progression again

[4:25:07] MrGattz: @northcub why do people under the age of 20 get drunk?
[4:25:14] RhadigarTV: @RhadigarTV It just makes sense. People will be given a choice: either stick with the progression of the server or start over on a fresh server. I like it
[4:25:16] dwolters_the_zombieman: N'Zoth was making you drink at that time lol

[5:11:26] GamerKillance: What I want to know if they'll give people a free level 58. I don't see it doing well unless they do that. Many people don't want to level in the old content and just want to jump into TBC

[6:53:51] RhadigarTV: That's Pantheon as well @Towelliee
[6:54:36] fowlentv: whatever happened to crowfall?
[6:54:44] Brodih_: Pantheon received a 7 figure investor recently, so they are good for now
[6:54:45] RhadigarTV: They want it this year
[6:54:45] NOHITJEROME: i forgot about crowfall
[6:55:03] korn66: will we get diablo 2 remake?
[6:55:24] NOHITJEROME: 7 figures isnt enough for an mmo
[6:55:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: Let me them live their dream :P

[6:57:00] xXTHEJESTXx: that's just rude lol
[6:57:05] ChuckNurrish: any thoughts on lost ark @Towelliee
[6:57:11] PisSeProphett: Rift was literally the best chance anyone had to competing with WOW. Even FFXIV looks good, but the grind is death
[6:57:12] JerzMcGerz: so many people have played LOL that it is going to be BIG
[6:57:15] Iolgz: from my limited exp of Rift it really didnt seem like a bad game at all

[6:57:50] Ishva: had a blast playing Rift when it first came out
[6:57:55] daveyman1234: profane is that the one like darkfall or MO?
[6:57:58] Enough83: it was new plus the open rifts
[6:58:11] Holychris: Can you do another state of the towelliee :D
[6:58:19] Aelissia: FFXIV is great, but it does take a while to get into the good stuff. The story doesn't get really good until later, so it can be grueling to get through the start.
[6:58:20] bodli1125: blizzard "you die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself becoming a villain"
[6:58:22] wolfieke: in real there are multiple mmos that have bigger playerbase then wow tho , it's just that most are free to play with cash shops and not sub based
[6:58:32] ProClicker: That Star Wars open world Division 2 type game they are making sounds good
[6:58:33] Kriven: so sad that star wars is still on that crappy engine and just a cash shop game now
[6:58:41] L4dy_Renegade: Kreygasm
[6:58:41] DocsMistake: its too bad that SWTOR is pretty trash after you complete the character story
[6:58:56] bodli1125: but the stroy makes it so mutch strong

[6:59:05] fowlentv: age of conan
[6:59:23] dysar5150: swtor is better now
[6:59:24] FruckAwesome: they made a single player MMO.. I stopped SWTOR when they stopped making raids..
[6:59:25] logic_fl: I still hope we get one more shot at a star wars mmo
[6:59:28] RavenARPG: SWTOR pvp was super fun (and still is)
[6:59:31] ViKiNgPillAgE89: age of conan trash
[6:59:32] Kriven: the core of star wars was great so sad it missed the mark
[6:59:35] psycothedruid: SWTOR still scratches an itch every now and then
[6:59:38] Kahoolo: pvp chugs so hard in swtor. It's a real turn off.
[6:59:43] FruckAwesome: huttball was the shit
[6:59:50] Orthobullet: I loved swtor

[6:59:54] SpectralExa: Huttball was tits
[6:59:57] fewyn: swtor was so good... until i got to the endgame
[7:00:02] Virelo: wildstar was fuckin amazing, they just literally never came out with more content then the 2 raids it launched with
[7:00:06] SubtlePat: Speaking of SWTOR I am downloading it now, making a Sith Assassin
[7:00:10] NOHITJEROME: its a great idea on paper
[7:00:14] raldrik: The trouble with starwars MMO's is that they run into storyline issues. If you cannot be as creative as you want to be in the storyline it limits your content to much
[7:00:20] mathiaschance12: swtor was fun back in the day but in its modern state it's weird
[7:00:26] fowlentv: I agree wildstar was so good
[7:00:32] NOHITJEROME: wildstar had potential for sure
[7:00:37] sarcanthanos: think they will have any Call of Duty news? lmao
[7:00:37] Iver_monk: Yah they weren't trying to hide it
[7:00:43] Holychris: Can you do another state of the towelliee :D
[7:00:43] Raanoren: I unsubbed to wow and returned to swtor last month.
[7:00:43] Murphybrown: blocky movement and lag in pvp killed it for me

[7:01:00] Dazz876: sadge
[7:01:07] daveyman1234: tbh trash truck simulator didn't have any microtransactions so that was a good game
[7:01:17] Calebreth: @Towelliee what platform is Blizcon going to be broadcasted on?
[7:01:21] DocsMistake: Wildstar was too ahead of its time, if it had come out later it would have been more successful I feel
[7:01:21] fowlentv: only thing wildstar didnt have going for it was ncsoft
[7:01:22] psycothedruid: @daveyman1234 PogChamp
[7:01:23] NuAera: ESO holds well doing it own thing, still fun game
[7:01:32] Virelo: i think ashes of creation is the last great hope now, but were looking at years before it comes out still
[7:01:37] xzi_: wildstar raiding was next fucking level
[7:01:40] zeitgeiz: Rift really leaned into the copy WoW thing
[7:01:40] Screamxan: everyone liked wildstar, i didnt get the chance to play it, was it as good as ppl said and why did it go down?
[7:01:45] ViKiNgPillAgE89: played wow 14 years was enough for me
[7:01:46] Rastamepas: Man I hope to see some Diablo news lol
[7:01:52] Virelo: yes wildstar was so so so good
[7:01:53] Kriven: lol Matrix online was such a shit show
[7:01:59] Virelo: the problem was they LITERALLY never added any new content
[7:02:00] stallowned: wildstar was a blast at launch, if it wasnt so hardcore with the attunements i think it would have been great
[7:02:08] Virelo: idk what happened behind the scenes, but everything in the game was great
[7:02:15] Screamxan: but why did it go down then?
[7:02:16] zeitgeiz: Who played Hellgate London? Lawl
[7:02:18] DeanoTV: and housing PepeHands
[7:02:20] fletch8: rip dead star
[7:02:27] xhaven: wildstar didnt cater to casual people and it had 0 lore as well
[7:02:29] khaider95: What about GW2? It was pretty fledged out, the combat system was just ehh

[7:02:43] Prime_Hype_: elder scrolls online though
[7:02:44] NickLeonhearth: i thought no1 played it because it looked like shit
[7:02:44] Iver_monk: Yup was not noob friendly
[7:02:45] Kriven: sadly it also had engine trouble when player count was scaled up
[7:02:51] fowlentv: that and it was ncsoft
[7:02:51] L4dy_Renegade: That and they didn't advertise the game worth a shit.
[7:02:53] Virelo: i mean thats part of it, but the bigger part is the game launched with 2 raids ,and after a year it still only had 2 raids
[7:03:03] gfield2k: What about Guild Wars ?
[7:03:06] jason_shade: same with swtor really idk
[7:03:15] jason_shade: released too soon
[7:03:30] Scardardar: ff was able to make a big come back in that way
[7:03:36] Kuroii_Ck: didnt some wildstar raiders try to achieve world 1st? and the guild barely made a mid tier boss LUL
[7:03:39] Toskens: "Get better", not be good enough :p
[7:03:46] khaider95: I think Guild Wars 2 would have been a success had they not changed the systems from Guild Wars 1, which was so customizable and fun
[7:03:47] KylerNA: Blizzard still has a decent repour with the community. Even in the struggled times.
[7:03:48] Virelo: i have big hopes for AoC i just hope they polish it and dont release it too early
[7:03:49] psycothedruid: @Scardardar FF is just SO slow. I can't stand the combat for an MMO style game
[7:03:58] Nerendis: Dead on Arrival the Amazon Games special (i'm so sad about Breakaway and Crucible tbh)
[7:04:06] its_hekks: @Towelliee its not the players that are impatient its the studio's.... stop releasing unfinished shit
[7:04:06] NOHITJEROME: shelf life for games is crazy short, people dont have the attention spans
[7:04:08] Draugen_MG: I was sad when they canceled Warhammer 40k mmo
[7:04:11] Throdio: ESO is also doing well
[7:04:13] daveyman1234: eve online too
[7:04:15] ventu105: @Towelliee what about New World is gona be good?
[7:04:19] Reap14: @psycothedruid XIV is not slow at all. You have never played to cap if you think it is slow.
[7:04:23] Strik3r019: do u think they will ever make a online version of skyrim?
[7:04:25] Kriven: you bet your ass if FF did not have the name final fantasy attached to it they would have let 14 die instead of putting massive rework into it
[7:04:27] Moronil: FF classes are really fun in max lvl, even more than wow IMO
[7:04:31] daveyman1234: and what about MUDs
[7:04:38] daveyman1234: archaea
[7:04:47] Broomba: wow is lagging
[7:04:48] psycothedruid: @Reap14 I have... and it still just feels slow. Not a fan, that's all
[7:04:51] Aelissia: FFXIV might feel slow at the start combat wise, but once you cap out and start doing the raids. It's a very different story.
[7:04:52] NOHITJEROME: the studios have pressure to deliver for investors
[7:05:10] jason_shade: ^ which is the problem
[7:05:11] NOHITJEROME: wow
[7:05:17] BubbaChubbs420: i think the free to play model screwed SWTOR
[7:05:21] zeitgeiz: I really like ESO caster combat, just can’t make a leap to a new MMO at this point. Too much time invested in WoW
[7:05:21] Damon_Riddle: star wars died the moment they couldnt push out their first content patch in a good time, took them WAY to long and people left
[7:05:24] NOHITJEROME: yeah blizzard knows how to compete
[7:05:26] Slaneyboy: Slaneyboy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[7:05:30] daveyman1234: wow is fun but time consuming
[7:05:30] Thoreya: Gimme that riot mmo :)
[7:05:31] NOHITJEROME: theres always a new patch around the same time
[7:05:31] GodKingMuninn: Imma play new world
[7:05:31] its_hekks: @Towelliee i was with you on wildstar.... i loved the game it was great. but it took too long to get there
[7:05:36] KylerNA: I'm so excited for TBC
[7:05:44] Thoreya: BC>>> new world
[7:05:49] Kromede: illum in SWTOR was a shitshow
[7:05:49] zeitgeiz: Man these 8 ads suck. Miss my prime no ads life
[7:05:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: Damn this BG is lasting forever lol
[7:05:57] NOHITJEROME: ima play tbc even though im excited for new world
[7:05:58] NOHITJEROME: its an easy choice
[7:06:00] mrmcnastywitit: @Towelliee the only other mmo i enjoy besides WoW is ESO its got alot better since launce
[7:06:04] mathiaschance12: bc is my favorite expansion and ive never even played it
[7:06:16] daveyman1234: yes the bag pipes was pretty killer tho
[7:06:17] Kuroii_Ck: i have to level from lvl 1 because of bloodelf
[7:06:24] Screamxan: @mrmcnastywitit eso shouldn't have released their battlegrounds at the horrible state they released it in
[7:06:48] Moejellini: Wait is it free to watch blizzcon?
[7:06:53] Moronil: I'd love to know how many subs WoW FFXIV and ESO actually have, real numbers
[7:06:55] Moejellini: or is it a pay per view
[7:06:58] Kromede: RIFT POGGERS
[7:07:02] Lemonlust: gw2?
[7:07:05] Kriven: I just dont like eso combat
[7:07:05] Screamxan: if wow died id play league again till the next giant mmo XD
[7:07:08] mrmcnastywitit: @screamwoww yeah i know i dont do to much pvp in eso tho so it didnt bother me as much
[7:07:10] TheUnknowing: I'd play ffxiv 100% if WoW died tomorrow
[7:07:12] L4dy_Renegade: @Bubbachubbs420 I kind of agree. If you're f2p, or even have a "preferred" acount, you have to spend money to unlock just about every damn thing in the game. You can't even hide your helm unless you're subbed/buy the option.
[7:07:14] daveyman1234: blizzvob in 2. 05 hours
[7:07:21] fowlentv: yeah eso combat is clunky to me
[7:07:21] camo_frog: Have you tried ff:14?
[7:07:22] iiWolfyyy: diablo music Kreygasm
[7:07:23] Roddox123: phantasy star 2 online
[7:07:24] mathiaschance12: star wars endgame isnt right tho
[7:07:33] duffluv22: Final Fantasy is just sooooo boring though
[7:07:33] therealhotwheels: The fact that your correct is upsetting because it is such a good business model for Blizz to release "new" content as other MMOs drop.
[7:07:35] Arocian: haha
[7:07:37] Kuroii_Ck: raiding cant be hard in ff14 you can raid on a controller LUL
[7:07:37] code0vsilence: guild wars 1 is sooo much better than gw2 HahaTurtledove HahaTurtledove

[7:07:57] Moejellini: is blizzcon free this year?
[7:07:59] Moronil: Ultimate difficulty in FF14 is the hardest thing I've played in a game
[7:08:01] Kromede: gfül towHAMUP
[7:08:03] TheUnknowing: the highest end stuff is apparently comparable to WoW's mythic so idk @ssbm_CK
[7:08:13] Osowareru: 30% ! towHype
[7:08:13] NOHITJEROME: that sounds good
[7:08:14] Infiniteanchor: @Towelliee do you do Rbg or arena for pvp gear?
[7:08:20] NOHITJEROME: logic has some good music
[7:08:25] owdiego: whats number 1??
[7:08:26] daveyman1234: ff14 is another mmo
[7:08:26] cebadec: @ssbm_CK Raiding in 14 is a literal dance. everything is on a script. as long as you press your buttons it's pretty much the same every time.
[7:08:26] Kuroii_Ck: even ultimate its limited in its complexity
[7:08:26] CritcobainTV: Code resets on reset day FeelsBadMan
[7:08:33] Spjuthok: What's Towel's raid progress?
[7:08:34] PoppaShot: @Towelliee hows the snowcone flavor
[7:08:52] BTech10: Towelliee one of your favs, Faze X, whats it taste similar to?
[7:08:57] cebadec: people make spreadsheets for ff14 raids. and once you learn the dance you are done.
[7:09:01] enux337: bomb pops
[7:09:01] Kriven: bomb pops
[7:09:05] CritcobainTV: tastes like FREEDOM BABY
[7:09:07] mrniceguy817: @towelliee if you haven’t heard logic listen to “everyday” pretty good
[7:09:23] Redn3ckHippie: @towelliee you really should try shined splash gfuel
[7:09:25] Knocx: im on BP meds and i dont think i can have gfuel
[7:09:29] BTech10: copy that, thank you sir o7
[7:09:29] iiWolfyyy: sour cherry or bluerazz was my favorites
[7:09:36] Sleyla: Do you guys know if there is a GFuel reseller for EU?
[7:09:46] Thdlock: KEKW
