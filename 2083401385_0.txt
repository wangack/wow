[0:31:51] SzSwordzero: I'm boring and no games lol
[0:31:53] Wooshu: Im working on my 2nd 60
[0:33:17] SzSwordzero: I used tiktok
[0:33:25] wolfsark: i didnt like how the best way to play feral druid was to spam sunfire in cat form
[0:33:28] Wooshu: When did Soda start the OnlyFangs hype? I started HC when that train happened but I went Horde
[0:33:47] wolfsark: yeah wild strikes was cool
[0:33:49] wolfsark: that alliance got that
[0:34:04] wolfsark: no they do
[0:34:07] ill3stdrew: shaman is op
[0:34:08] wolfsark: but alliance doesnt have shaman
[0:34:11] ill3stdrew: in sod
[0:34:12] Wooshu: Yeah Tauren
[0:34:24] wolfsark: so alliance couldnt get windfury in classic
[0:34:38] Renfuryy: Horde got blessing of kings on hunters, alliance got windfury on druid
[0:34:44] Renfuryy: making it equal
[0:34:56] SzSwordzero: Belf me lol
[0:35:03] Renfuryy: horde doesnt have paladins
[0:35:06] ill3stdrew: yea feral druid buffs melee
[0:35:07] Renfuryy: they didnt have access to the buff before
[0:35:11] wolfsark: did hunters get that at 40?
[0:35:14] Renfuryy: Hunters
[0:35:16] wolfsark: or was that in 25 also
[0:35:18] Renfuryy: it was 25
[0:35:25] ill3stdrew: horde hunters
[0:35:30] Renfuryy: yes its an aura
[0:35:31] wolfsark: oh ok, i didnt notice that i guess
[0:35:35] Wooshu: What one is Blessing of Kings again?
[0:35:43] SzSwordzero: Great paladin for me best 👌
[0:35:45] Wooshu: What does the Aura give
[0:35:47] ill3stdrew: ally feral gets windfury
[0:35:53] Renfuryy: aspect
[0:35:57] Renfuryy: like aspect of the pack
[0:36:00] wolfsark: aspect of 10% stats?
[0:36:02] Renfuryy: yes

[1:00:00] Renfuryy: Thinking
[1:00:04] Zefior: Nope

[1:03:50] Pyroheet: Maybe its like normal tier 1 but if you want upgrade to tier 2 or 3 you pay extra >
[1:04:46] DesiHeat: tier 1 OR elevate = either prime, or tier 2 or tier 3 or multiple months
[1:04:52] Pyroheet: NODDERS maybe yah
[1:05:06] Zefior: that would be a good interpretation yes
[1:05:14] fknstag: this zaza got me elevated rn
[1:05:18] Zefior: yes i didnt have to refresh the stream
[1:05:19] Elijahss: Next month I am just gonna 6 month sub if that equals more of it going to you.  I will use my Prime elsewhere.

[8:18:23] Awetum: I was Frost in phase 1. Didn't feel as fun as Arcane
[8:18:40] QuickLouis: everything is a lot of upfront damage in SOD, so fire works better than control frost
[8:18:40] Arthident: fuegoNotes
[8:18:59] Awetum: Everything will feel better at 60 when we have all the runes
[8:19:18] Elijahss: I think Graycen is Frost bc he is hardcore into pvp, and Xaryu is arcane
[8:19:42] QuickLouis: frost was already strong and wasnt the design choice of SOD to make more specs viable?
[8:20:11] Denat0: i'm already flying to westfall
[8:20:24] PatchesMcPatch: xaryu is frost
[8:20:36] Elijahss: Is he now?
