[1:07:49] Iceman787B: it is based on sped
[1:07:49] murdrb0t: its called engine breaking, it helps you slow down by down shifting
[1:07:50] mailstrike13: no just tight turns like hairpins

[1:07:55] stealthyagenda: No
[1:07:55] DanS0L0: DieSoN__ ive heard good things
[1:07:57] WuguiDashi: car has enough hp and torque to do fine in 2nd on those
[1:07:58] j_hydr0: outside to inside lines brake and down shift to 1st then bang gears coming out of the corners
[1:07:59] riddler_007: 1st gear for takeoff
[1:07:59] clipse303: @LogicalSolutions omg u watch shroud lol ur my hero
[1:07:59] mejsiu99z: No way shroud is playing racing game, aiint no way
[1:07:59] DieSoN__: u are perfect candidate
[1:08:00] ragesaq: pay attention to your driving line, it changes depending on if you are over or under your optimal racing speed
[1:08:00] dragogeta: it depends on the timing of the shift and speed too
[1:08:02] stealthyagenda: Correlates to speed
[1:08:02] Chrome91: The trick is to listen to the engine.
[1:08:04] H3FFER_aka_silas: maybe try hood view, sometimes lots easier with wheel
[1:08:05] scrubcity_: Speed and how much you need to rotate the car
[1:08:08] brud007: be in the highest gear possible for each turn
[1:08:09] guardiansofthenight: You never go to 1 on a manual except to start from 0. Hardest turn, you bump down to 2
[1:08:14] stealthyagenda: You are correct
[1:08:16] NexLap: no, but you can't turn the car on the gas. you need to get your braking done before the corner and trail brake into the apex
[1:08:17] brian_btdm: @Yasdo pls dont talk if you do not know about it
[1:08:20] OddWinter: Cant u just bind a key thall take u directly to 1 ?

[1:08:33] tharealguru: Fun to see shroud struggle with a game:)
[1:08:35] JoshRedVillage: don't brake while you turn
[1:08:36] sp33dyal: you slow down a lot till you're a bit past it and speed up ?
[1:08:37] AJ_0500: go to 1st gear on that turn
[1:08:38] Shaggy2point0: if corner is like a u turn go to 1 rest usually 2
[1:08:39] clipse303: break before the turn, gas through the apex @shroud
[1:08:40] icemanx37: You can try at first. If get a feel for the perfect racing line you can use higher gear. But the narrower you take the turn, the lower the gear you need
[1:08:40] EMG_Jeeses: I see potential! He wish in real, there would be all those assists
[1:08:41] H3FFER_aka_silas: Hood view will feel more like real driving
[1:08:43] Roboturd36: shroudDab
[1:08:47] Meak_Hsaka: 1.45
[1:08:50] romlich: Highly suggest turning the arrows off, you really need to get used to the feel of the car and when to use downshifting
[1:08:51] WuguiDashi: dont press the throttle down when you do sharp turns, or else your wheels will basically spin out @shroud
[1:08:51] SevenClad: merrrrrrRrrrRrrrRRR KKona
[1:08:52] TraxParadox: you have to take a wide turn and hit the apex
[1:08:52] Meak_Hsaka: not bad

[1:12:42] mouga68: @shroud when entering turns get on the brakes soft then full press instead of instantly slamming them. then when exiting turns you should trail brake until the apex then get on the throttle gradually as fast as you can as you straighten out. most important thing while driving these cars is being smooth in all pedal and steering inputs

[1:19:09] asboredasur: You'd probly be better driving with Keyboard & Mouse LUL
[1:19:10] mrhighland27: @shroud its because you dont learn the breaking points, bcs you are just watching the line. if you learn the breaking points without the line you will be faster. if you are playing with ABS breaking, you will be slover as well, because you cant apply enough break pressure without the ABS kicking in - thereby you cant ¬®late break¬®in an overtake. Your welcome

[1:20:04] chummychum18: chazmo, go win this ting, stop watching
[1:20:06] Cvi7kovsky: @shroud You should try to engine break in few corners just by releasing the throttle instead of using brakes
[1:20:07] asboredasur: Brake In - Accelerate Out
[1:20:07] TraxParadox: "tight"
[1:20:08] pantanni: @ls_virus what mods for ACC, do you mean AC? AC original is the one w/ tons of mods

[1:20:19] saltybopss: generally the slower you enter a corner the faster you can exit @shroud
[1:20:19] ProworgZ: slow in fast out
[1:20:22] yarno_jp: green line doesn't mean full throttle
[1:20:22] Iceman787B: tight corner = low gear/brake lots
[1:20:29] root_Zz: @shroud sharp is a better word than hard

[1:20:36] Jardier: @Dullestmosquito LUL

[1:20:41] j6simracing: The force feedback in ACC is top notch, I love it!!
[1:20:44] henrizzle: The more you turn your wheel the less you should accelerate or brake since you have limited traction

[1:20:46] BigDaz72: killing it
[1:20:46] El_Cannacultor: fast in slow out Kappa

[9:47:23] Windeko: millionaire saying these $60 games are cheap Sadge

[9:47:26] Xyras_: are you able to start Dragon Flight at 58 or do you have to be 60
[9:47:27] abaraba_: they literally cost that much in 1990s dollars
[9:47:28] Exec__: Back then the games were complete on launch :D
[9:47:28] dennisdrums: triumph Return to val?

[9:48:17] Rykkeee: you think you could main this class?
[9:48:18] drizz_: i had to mow a lot of lawns to buy an n64
[9:48:22] Kukrus: Two things remained the same price over the years, its games and drugs, which is kinda interesting
[9:48:24] lonewolfzor: Since games are non-tangible the price is only fixated on the cost of development, they can keep the prices low and make a large profit IF the market keeps expanding.
[9:48:27] MyrByGg: What entertaiment you can get which is more value than example 70 dolla vidja game which has 100h playtime/value? 70 cent/h for all  the movies inside, music, gameplay, funsies. Great deal fo so
