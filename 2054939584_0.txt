[1:05:50] RayeAerinae: 1 in 4 keys is decent, but those 3 out of 4 is just straight misery of 480 ilvl morons that press 0 defensives or interrupts
[1:06:00] RayeAerinae: but that 1 key out of 4 is easy street
[1:06:14] RayeAerinae: but struggling through those 3 out of 4 keys sucks ass, and i'm worn out
[1:06:16] heyshanna: congrats on nothing
[1:06:32] ren0m: You never said that to me when i re-subbed

[1:06:54] ren0m: Gotcha
[1:06:58] RayeAerinae: bruh...
[1:07:05] RayeAerinae: yeah, i feel like the only reliable play is finding a group
[1:07:08] Snaaade: @rayeaerinae if you play your own keys, use io and only invite ppl who done it + is like 15-20+ completed 20s.. they should know what they are doing

[4:10:07] CaptainBoop: that logic passes rigor
[4:10:07] Tombah: thats law
[4:10:11] Standy94: you have to say nohomo though
[4:10:17] Harthad: it's not gay if balls don't touch

[4:32:21] Spritesgud: ya it was double fires
[4:32:26] Spritesgud: rogue got 1 shot
[4:32:30] Spritesgud: pala got 2 shot
[4:32:33] ottomr1990: @Standy94 that's his secret. he's always yelling

[4:33:23] startlord92: take triple mage
[4:33:36] tokenlul: Soul thorns needs to do way less damage
[4:33:43] Xevenna: i think the fire is the worst part. they can just go away on the way to them even
[4:33:43] tokenlul: maybe have more health to make up for it idk
[4:33:46] flawlesslykun: u got tanks that want to be heros and then burn the boss in the worse possible time KEKW
[4:33:59] Xevenna: and then that messes up timing if you have to wait for thorns
[4:35:23] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[4:35:24] ottomr1990: the fire disappearing on you as a tank is an event worthy of going to therapy for

[5:12:16] SevzyYEP: that could get complex real damn quick
[5:12:24] zebracak35: Nope, its teh same thign as elon. Its public info, hes just putting it in an easy to find medium
[5:12:26] SneakyWoodPecker: law degree coming in clutch for debates with twitch chat
[5:12:58] SevzyYEP: Intent of what you do with the info plays a huge part
[5:13:05] saileia: jb: makes a tier list. the internet: jb is parked here.
[5:13:15] flawlesslykun: @w0lfh4rt speak for your country dude, here in portugal we currently have thousands if not a million already, imigrants from all over the world, working slave jobs, living 20 or 30 inside a single house
[5:13:16] zebracak35: Not sueing the college kid making the website
[5:13:25] Whitewolf1441: @saileia lmao reasonable reaction
[5:13:28] zebracak35: Elon already lost
[5:14:04] Whitewolf1441: why is he doing that is the question
[5:14:06] zebracak35: tracking carbon emissions
[5:14:24] keenxp: is it harming society
[5:14:40] BigTrout3: Reinforcing "eat the rich"
[5:14:42] SCMSV: kid's making the next flight sim classic

[5:14:59] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:15:07] saileia: 4th estate oversight on the behaviors and excesses of the rich is valuable to society
[5:15:32] saileia: but he could delay 24hrs the info and achieve that
[5:15:47] zebracak35: shes just mad shes getting called out for how much shes flying
[5:15:56] Whitewolf1441: because countries dont want random people popping in
[5:15:58] Whitewolf1441: i assume
[5:15:58] SevzyYEP: @jdotb no clue why this came into my head but if you had to fight 1 celeb UFC style, who would it be?
[5:16:10] almey13: want evoker or dps? @jdotb
[5:16:36] Whitewolf1441: sounds dangerous
[5:16:40] zebracak35: also it helps sprots players know who is signing where (Joke answer)
[5:16:54] saileia: she has tons of stalkers. she probably legitimately does not want to be real time lojacked if it can be prevented.
[5:16:59] zzugelder: should just pay to plant 10k trees counter act her jet fuel use
[5:17:34] MrDadDude: the argument could be made that information could only be used nafariously
[5:17:42] SevzyYEP: surely she should sue whichever entity makes that info available instead of the person using it
[5:17:42] keenxp: its taylor swift
[5:17:46] Whitewolf1441: so basically youre telling us to hold out on having opinions
[5:17:54] keenxp: no weirdo is getting close
[5:17:57] keenxp: but i see ur point
[5:18:01] saileia: she buys carbon credits to more than cover her flights and tour impact. those do have their own issues.
[5:18:57] Snaaade: Now that you have the fyrakk trinket, do you always go balance loot spec for vault ?
[5:20:23] slimshadys_shade: Will Mahomes surpass Bradys 7 rings? @jdotb 2
[5:21:10] Phatori: this is Mahomes last run at a ring callin it

[5:21:28] Perry_TP: how many does he have so far
[5:22:13] slimshadys_shade: @Perry_TP 2 if I recall it correctly
[5:23:18] cyn_x: nobody matching brady in our lifetime
[5:23:54] cyn_x: he went to 10 super bowls
[5:23:55] magemaster225: call me when KC has an undefeated season
[5:23:55] r1or: mahomes could play 10 more years and be lucky to get 3 more rings
[5:24:16] slimshadys_shade: I still cant get over the Seahawks vs Patriots super bowl
[5:25:12] SneakyWoodPecker: also won't have Kelce for too much longer
