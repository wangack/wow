[1:09:46] StreamElements: Xaryu's setup -> https://www.amazon.com/shop/xaryulol
[1:09:49] FIREMAGZZ: no offense Xaryu, but you have the power and influence to make your own Gdkp on a whim and could have bought that weapon *cheaper*. Joining someone else's being a big streamer is an L for sure.

[1:10:56] chr47: That's when you stop bidding and let them have it
[1:10:59] thegreatestadam: Bro that was good storytelling
[1:11:00] Dhars: I've had the same thing happen to me, and I backed off the bid and said they can vendor the item.
[1:11:02] Kuijano: There better be penalties for bidding above your weightclass
[1:11:04] schref: shouldve left the hunter get it
[1:11:04] burnsthedude: xarPain xarPain xarPain xarPain xarPain

[1:12:02] tehwaterboy: I will say at least you walked away with gold and a story and not just a story
[1:12:05] schref: worth
[1:12:10] Vatrenak: If they are part of the scam the don't need to pay for it either if they win it? o_O
[1:12:11] tywilldoittv: 100% because you're a stream - that doesn't happen to the normies unless you volunteer how much heat you're packin. But only the Raid lead should of known that from asking your budget

[1:18:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @thegreatestadam not really… they’re directly related
[1:18:08] MonzonWasTaken: TRUEEEEEEEE
[1:18:09] babastarz55: gdkp also removed on wrath? ?
[1:18:10] jiggy9: you guys should just be on a call, it's hard to follow a quad react
[1:18:13] ChairsHaveFeelings: Did I accidentally tune into Asmon?
[1:18:14] Dwaggle: so dont? lol
[1:18:15] tigershyvana: no
[1:18:16] imhiddenhills: i dont have time to raid in a guild, gdkp is pretty much the only way I can raid and have a chance at the loot i want
[1:18:16] mithrandoig: my brain is going to explode from all these reactions
[1:18:17] Kedor2k: I mean, Asmongold has never been in a GDKP...
[1:18:18] mithrandoig: i cant keep up
[1:18:18] jimmysnowshoes: He's not playing the game
[1:18:18] CoolTV: Asmon is SO wrong about it, he's not playing the game, random opinion PogOSquad
[1:18:19] Jay667b: @babastarz55 just SoD for now
[1:18:20] Kuijano: @babastarz55 Right now, just in SoD
[1:18:21] HarryJPotter94: massice L
[1:18:23] MonzonWasTaken: @Dwaggle he doesnt LUL
[1:18:24] xmrdojox: I’m a noob what’s GDKP
[1:18:24] serverfirst300003: @AngerManagmt you can find 2sr group w/o any gdkp ez
[1:18:25] rocknsake: lmfao, which is the real Xaryu
[1:18:28] squarepusher_: let's be real, he's not playing the game.
[1:18:29] BullzeyeWoW: Headache...
[1:18:30] Vandracon: oh look we can react to our old reacts too :D
[1:18:31] babastarz55: i left game because of gdkp
[1:18:33] thegreatestadam: Never participated in a GDKP EVER, as much as my broke boy characters need gold I do not need it that bad.
[1:18:34] Kuda1000: monkaHmm
[1:18:37] Sgt_TBag: I can't wait for the react to the reacting react content so that the whole screen is just Xaryu and Asmon LUL
[1:18:40] fabulais: @Keytamei Im a snitch, i love the game and buying gold hurts its so much. I report em and tell that to their faces, they dont give a shit cuz nothing happens, so meh
[1:18:40] Sirmoney1: This twilight zone is hurting my head.. I don't know if its AI talking or Xaryu. :D
[1:18:42] thegreatestadam: and since I dont buy gold I dont join them to get gear.
[1:18:45] xOutcoldx: so he is saying they are being lazy so therefore it is fair for him to break rules that are set into the game "which is gold buying is against tos"
[1:18:47] Slyratt: asmon doesn’t even play the game
[1:18:47] BullzeyeWoW: Wil the real Xaryu please stand up...
[1:18:49] imhiddenhills: i dont have time to raid in a guild, gdkp is pretty much the only way I can raid and have a chance at the loot i want
[1:18:51] Buffoncete: its not the easiest way, but almost all the GDKP perform and people does not leave, SR or MS OS pugs disband before end boss
[1:18:55] BrigAndSigConnection: ive pugged bfd 2x a week for 2 months and have all my items, haven't spent a cent for any of it
[1:19:03] cucudrulo: which one is the real xar?
[1:19:07] Beave_86: same shirt LUL
[1:19:09] smashdakeys: @Xaryu you both are wearing the ssame shirts lmao
[1:19:09] Kuda1000: is Asmon going to react to this?
[1:19:11] Big_Zum: @xaryu waiting for asmon to react to this video. would be so funny
[1:19:11] yexulz: ppl who dont like gdkps are just shitters who cant fathom someone playing the game differently than they do
[1:19:12] iscamog: same shirt x2
[1:19:14] e7icarium: why would you have to join gdkp i don't get it. If you dont like it go to ffa or sr raids or even with your guild
[1:19:15] Goobadoobadoob: I must have just gotten lucky and got a guild that is decent and never have to do a gdkp for gear
[1:19:16] dwolfking: thank god AWC ios starting
[1:19:16] Snaketrap: jokrdOiler
[1:19:17] Sirmoney1: None of them are REAL Xaryu.
[1:19:17] Medinore: I agree with asmon, I hosted gdkps in P1 and got perma banned for RMT because I indirectly received RMT gold. Blizzard should have never allowed GDKPs in the first place if they can't enforce gold buying in the first place
[1:19:17] xhappyxhappyx: Xaryu reacting to asmongold react to xaryu react to asmongold react to gdkp being banned.
[1:19:18] warrndu: INCEPTION
[1:19:22] tentoesdowndeep: Promote a more positive way, instead of playing whack a mole
[1:19:22] BlownFuse_: bro. what is going on. who is actually real here
[1:19:24] zerozuckerl: BAN THEM GUYS
[1:19:25] Nevamind0: what is that quadruple reaction
[1:19:27] DrugaKhan: It's not about right/wrong, it's about if ppl had good/bad experience - gdkp only benefits a miniority
[1:19:31] mithrandoig: @xhappyxhappyx i need this to be the stream title
[1:19:33] BlownFuse_: I’m so confused
[1:19:34] Vandracon: asmond is taking over
[1:19:34] alexgoat94: he goes off at the end
[1:19:36] dumpringz: @xhappyxhappyx winception
[1:19:36] Kuda1000: Common Xaryu/Asmon W
[1:19:37] tmilla_89: GDKP is so lame
[1:19:40] toerray: We should applaud Xaryu for sitting and actually listening to his voice for that long without pausing at the end there
[1:19:40] fabulais: @yexulz No more swiping for you. mister swiper, bye bye
[1:19:41] Prevara96: wat u the ene
[1:19:41] mithrandoig: TOO MANY REACTIONS MY BRAIN HURTS
[1:19:42] 0hlando: xaryu is reacting to asmongold reacting to xaryu reacting to asmongold. this is next gen shit
[1:19:43] Kuijano: Swockwickdus time Pog
[1:19:43] williwhite94: yea
[1:19:43] AceOfFlame: @Medinore Then stop doing GDKPS that have gold buyers...its that simple
[1:19:46] BullzeyeWoW: Watch
[1:19:46] Trix_x: Did you see the only fangs part
[1:19:47] ashhka02: I dont even think he is disagreeing with you
[1:19:47] zerozuckerl: skip
[1:19:47] rizlesss: watch
[1:19:47] jeneraljelly: watch
[1:19:48] RaizenHQ: Watch it
[1:19:49] Vega36: watch
[1:19:49] greu_public_enemy: problem is not that players buy gold,but they buy gold with stolen credit cards :P
[1:19:49] Prevara96: watch the end
[1:19:50] BujuArena: it's just 2 more minutes; watch imo
[1:19:50] Kuda1000: Watch
[1:19:51] oTrentx: WATCH
[1:19:52] williwhite94: watch it good end
[1:19:52] Nezhoni: enshrouded
[1:19:53] clee0724: wtach
[1:19:53] thatdogbitme: no one who isnt buying gold is being invited to any gdkp now, it's silly to even dispute
[1:19:54] thegreatestadam: bro just skip 1 minute
[1:19:55] drummond777: why would blizzard ban the bots selling gold when they make money off them? easy solution is ban GDKPs
[1:20:01] Nezhoni: Bedge
[1:20:01] saucyjay: bro what is this lol? Asmon, watching himself, Zaryu watching that, then zaryu watching himself watch himself?
[1:20:02] Medinore: @Medinore there's no way to know whether someone has bought gold or not
[1:20:04] Fuilund: can’t wait for tomorrow when we watch Xar react to asmon reacting to xar react to asmon. im here for it xD
[1:20:06] morticianbuera: can't stand this guy
[1:20:08] imhiddenhills: i dont have time to raid in a guild, gdkp is pretty much the only way I can raid and have a chance at the loot i want
[1:20:09] zartuus: one of the reason i dont like GDKP is that being pay for my time in the raid feel like im doing work. If i really want to be pay for something ill do real job and not job in wow. Wow become a job with GDKP
[1:20:09] Medinore: as a player
[1:20:14] xhappyxhappyx: you can feel the last bit of care for the game come out at the end.
[1:20:14] ashhka02: I think he is agreeing with you but is okay taking the bought gold because he isnt buying it.
[1:20:14] mithrandoig: react streams big L
[1:20:20] dumpringz: wait is xaryu ag1 or asmon
[1:20:29] xOutcoldx: It is against rules to buy gold yes it is not the best way to enforce it , but just because something is not enforced properly doesnt make it right
[1:20:31] Reaperz_kinetic: @zartuus imo that’s flawed thinking
[1:20:35] yexulz: @yexulz @fabulais never swiped once lmfao i go to gdkps with my alt who i LC all the loot to so i can go make free money for carries
[1:20:43] fabulais: @imhiddenhills There's a lot of guillds with differents raid times and cores, that's such a bad excuse, swipe swipe swipe
[1:20:43] Breakfist_: @dumpringz xar
[1:20:46] combobulous: Just remember asmon is biased, because he is legit on the other side of the gold buying...by selling gold, that's how he became who he was...selling gold, lol
[1:20:47] thegreatestadam: But who's fault is it when you go into a raid knowing you can bid for gear
[1:20:47] Snaketrap: mysticxLaugh
[1:20:49] im_capy: OTK openly buys gold LUL
[1:20:51] Faraday5001: thats just wrong
[1:20:56] Slyratt: not banning soda perma was a big blizzard L imo
[1:20:57] lolartsection: They are banning gold buyers yes
[1:20:59] ahfast: but I mean, I don't participate in GDKP and I still enjoy the game, I don't mind if it exists or not....
[1:21:00] dramajohns: alot better
[1:21:02] xhappyxhappyx: I've bought over 1k gold in sod with no bans so far so
[1:21:02] MonzonWasTaken: THEY ARENT LUL
[1:21:03] 0hlando: I GOT A LETTER IN THE MAIL SAYING I GOT A BOT BANNED WHAT HE TALKIN ABOUT
[1:21:06] tmilla_89: totally not a fair statement
[1:21:06] Kedor2k: I have been buying gold for YEARS, and have never had any trouble
[1:21:10] bralter: how can he say that when blizzard posts everytime they ban people...but they could do better
[1:21:12] Alaithan: I wish it was 1 week lockout so I can have an actual weekly schedule
[1:21:13] yexulz: imagine caring how others play the game
[1:21:14] CoolTV: GDKP promotes gold buying, we dont need G2A andies in SOD
[1:21:15] Verynicepotato: monkaS
[1:21:15] xOutcoldx: Even if they are not does that make it right to break TOS and buy gold?
[1:21:15] mariuzzz: its half assed trying
[1:21:17] ashhka02: @Xaryu something tells me that Bllizzard has a list somewhere of all the gold buyers/gold sellers, and if they ban 50% of their player base that asmon is guessing. Its a lot of cash
[1:21:17] Kuda1000: monkaW
[1:21:24] lolartsection: Soda got his gold deleted
[1:21:24] Snaketrap: jokrdKEKW react
[1:21:25] im_capy: :)
[1:21:26] hot_souffle: TRUE AS FK
[1:21:26] xhappyxhappyx: "probably"
[1:21:26] Kuda1000: HE SAID THE THING Pog
[1:21:27] thatdogbitme: @im_capy at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they have a steak in gold selling, it's that open
[1:21:28] crucias212: lol
[1:21:29] Reaperz_kinetic: @kedor2k so you’re a rat that’s part of the problem
[1:21:32] DrazonTV: true
[1:21:33] Reaperz_kinetic: TRUUUUUUUUE
[1:21:36] coolcoolcool777dood: why do u think its not a fair statement?? like u cant just say its not fair statement without giving us some information to back it up?
[1:21:37] clee0724: TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[1:21:39] hot_souffle: ABSOLUTE TRUE
[1:21:42] morticianbuera: Payo is buying gold too
[1:21:44] Reaperz_kinetic: he’s 1000% correct here tbh
[1:21:44] blastingjohnson: they do nothing , i saw people buy 100k in classic and nothing happend
[1:21:46] Kuda1000: BasedGod
[1:21:47] SilkeySmooth: soda gave rav 6000gold after that he is still buying gold
[1:21:47] Calibyr: Calibyr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 36 month streak! lmao this is so confusing to listen to audio only. my brain cant keep up with which version is talking
[1:21:49] Vatrenak: Soda should have been banned
[1:21:50] pluids: Blizz makes so much money on these gold farmers having hundreds of subscriptions
[1:21:52] BrigAndSigConnection: ppl bought gold and gave them to onlyfangs, even xaryu was accepting massive amounts of gold on stream
[1:21:57] Kuda1000: Common Asmon W
[1:22:00] Tropicocity: EZ asmon
[1:22:02] D3FT: based
[1:22:02] 1plus2break: Hopefully whatever tech they are bringing over from retail for p2 does some good
[1:22:04] ItsJhelo: I disagree, WoW knows the gold buying is happening, they even know how and who is doing it. They have never cared to fix it.
[1:22:05] DrazonTV: real and true
[1:22:11] thegreatestadam: That is because the common joke about Blizzard having a cut in buying gold might have some truth to it.
[1:22:13] CoolTV: true KEKW
[1:22:15] Aisssey: TRUE
[1:22:16] D3FT: yep
[1:22:17] Tropicocity: KEKW KEKW
[1:22:18] viggokiller: LUL
[1:22:20] Kuda1000: HUH
[1:22:20] Tropicocity: I frickin love asmon man
[1:22:21] clee0724: KEKW true
[1:22:22] bluehannya84: people buy gold they play more why would they stop that
[1:22:23] gnated: babsed
[1:22:24] MonzonWasTaken: BASED
[1:22:25] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu A popular WoW youtuber just recently caught a false ban for trading a large amount of gold to someone he didn't know was a gold seller so I think Blizzard is definitely banning gold buyers when they can... unless it's a streamer like Soda KEKW
[1:22:25] gnated: based
[1:22:26] alexgoat94: mic drop
[1:22:28] don_kneee: trueeeeeeeeeeee
[1:22:28] williwhite94: yeah fuck master loot bro

[1:22:32] Dwaggle: Welcome to real life asmon :)
[1:22:33] B_Rize: BASED AF
[1:22:34] ashhka02: Gold buyers watching Asmons react PogChamp PogChamp
[1:22:35] ItsJhelo: I knew they didnt care about gold buying and selling when they started selling gametime tokens.
[1:22:36] RamboStallone: hes mad he cant buy loot Kappa
[1:22:38] Kuda1000: Asmon <3
[1:22:42] jumpalottahigh: EXACTLLY how i feel about GDKPs
[1:22:46] 0hlando: cant wait until asmon reacts to xaryu reacting to asmongold reaction of xaryu reacting to asmongold
[1:22:46] ironmouse34: now where's the argument FOR GDKP?
[1:22:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @itsjhelo you’re wrong lol
[1:22:47] jumpalottahigh: blizz taking the easy way out
[1:22:50] dumpringz: dont have to like him but he's based af
[1:22:53] Tropicocity: He actually doesnt disagree with them trying this out on SoD tbh
[1:22:54] selmoTV: he is right
[1:22:55] AceOfFlame: @RamboStallone he doesnt need to, he gets it for free for last 8 years ago
[1:22:56] 1plus2break: The only reason Soda didn't get banned was because OF was bringing massive viewer numbers on WoW
[1:22:56] Genghjs: Xaryu = Blizzard...
[1:22:59] Nok0so: they cant ban onlyfangs because they are their greatest game advertisement
[1:23:00] drummond777: @RamboStallone his viewers just give it to him anyways
[1:23:00] TheRealTeamNoSleep: I don’t think they are trying at all
[1:23:01] thegreatestadam: Idk man gold selling is like buying and selling stonk
[1:23:06] Zerksyera: he doesn’t need to buy loot. that comment makes no sense
[1:23:08] Kuijano: @ItsJhelo They released Tokens to try and steal profit from the non-Blizz sellers
[1:23:09] PMA_1: xarPog
[1:23:09] Kagoon46: Xaryu new GM
[1:23:11] selmoTV: OFangs 0 bans
[1:23:12] rammd4wg: streamer discord with devs
[1:23:12] demonicmommy: I just think the loot system needs to go back to ur own loot and either u get something or you don't
[1:23:13] bralter: asmons like im rich i can buy gold and benefit from this lets keep this
[1:23:16] xOutcoldx: With his logic we should all just go rob banks because its not enforced properly lol @Xaryu
[1:23:17] don_kneee: they gotta say that tho
[1:23:19] Larewt: How is blizz gonna ban GDKP participants when they don't even ban people breaking the previous rules of no buying gold
[1:23:19] roxzssx: "working"
[1:23:19] Snaketrap: Kappa
[1:23:20] TundraSpice: morning ;) - blizzard
[1:23:22] lizardking1091: Kappa
[1:23:23] PetSeL_: whats the problem if you wanne buy gold? who says its not even people from WW
[1:23:23] selmoTV: "trying"
[1:23:24] roxzssx: ofc they will say that
[1:23:25] bladeezz1816: Regular old DKP was actually perfect @xaryu how did we stray so far ??
[1:23:26] Nok0so: removing gold is best solution, not banning
[1:23:30] JonasDM_HS: not enough people trying
[1:23:31] Snaketrap: mysticxMystiCopium
[1:23:32] roxzssx: fake working
[1:23:34] RamboStallone: @AceOfFlame @drummond777 tru tru, fking simps KEKW
[1:23:36] ggped89: They've been working on it for years lol
[1:23:36] MonzonWasTaken: if they dont hire anyone to solve the problem, they arent trying
[1:23:36] Gunnan22: Blizz will not spend enough money to  solve the problem
[1:23:36] ItsJhelo: @Reaperz_kinetic Great counter points here... ZZZZ
[1:23:36] Vandracon: @Nok0so multi currency
[1:23:36] renerottingham: literal hordes of flying bots
[1:23:37] ShingaTV: 100%
[1:23:39] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Can't talk right now Xar, we are working on it Kappa
[1:23:40] Kuda1000: at least 30 days
[1:23:41] Slyratt: sodapoppin should have been permanently banned
[1:23:46] im_capy: now everyone fired at Blizz LUL
[1:23:48] Zerksyera: ban gold buying not gdkp
[1:23:52] Reaperz_kinetic: @don_kneee not really they’re people he knows personally… they could say yeah blizzard doesn’t really care about it we don’t get payed to fix it
[1:23:53] parkrangerpeter: Bro we were all screaming from the rooftops they should've all been banned
[1:23:54] BrigAndSigConnection: you should also ban the accounts that accept large amount of gold from strangers who buy gold
[1:23:56] ShingaTV: so what
[1:23:59] yexulz: why dont they ban the AH because according to the gdkp deniers, all the gold is bought so therefore the AH promotes RMT by having inflated prices
[1:24:01] Snaketrap: jokrdKEKU
[1:24:03] nillgren: doesn't matter
[1:24:04] Dodupyzaur: what soda did?
[1:24:04] fenderisss: Yeah they need to be strict from the beginning
[1:24:05] taylorsdank: yeah they wouldve been "Wrong" for either decision in the communities eyes
[1:24:05] ggped89: They stand to lose too much money if they start banning everyone buying gold
[1:24:06] MonzonWasTaken: WHO CARES
[1:24:07] AnyroadTwo: OnlyFangs was a joke.
[1:24:08] yexulz: banning gdkp does nothing lol
[1:24:12] HypnosEffect: okay but streamers get hella gold from random ppl that are forsure buying gold @Xaryu
[1:24:12] Big_Zum: @xaryu as u are one of the front faces for the community it’s good news that you get to talk to them. u see it first hand from chat and play
[1:24:12] lildryu: there is a difference between "trying" and trying...setting one guy to work on the problem isn't actually trying 🤷‍♂️ (obviously I don't know how many people are actually working on the issue, but you get the idea)
[1:24:13] thatdogbitme: @Slyratt not permanently, but he should have been  banned for his open buying
[1:24:14] Hawkit: Are people surprised they didn't nuke everyone streaming their game with bans for gold selling. KEKW
[1:24:14] thegreatestadam: It helps their in-game economy imo
[1:24:14] inspect4: @yexulz clueless
[1:24:16] Xzanelol: and he ended up taking a break making them look evne more stupid
[1:24:17] JihnFei: onlyfangs brought life to hardcore unfortunately. it was dumb but it had never been more alive
[1:24:19] Vandracon: @parkrangerpeter a program pretending to be a person that can be updated to act more like a person. its not easy
[1:24:20] clee0724: business is business
[1:24:21] rammd4wg: Onlyfangs was a mockery of the game
[1:24:22] xOutcoldx: Like this doesnt happen irl its politics set an example etc
[1:24:26] coolcoolcool777dood: WHY DOESNT BLIZZ OFFER A NARC SERVICE. IF A NARC CAN PROVE U SOLD THEM GOLD, THAT GOLD SELLER GETS BANNED???????
[1:24:30] selmoTV: so gold buying is fine by bliz standards
[1:24:30] DevonAufinde: AnyroadTwo it was best wow content in years
[1:24:31] Hawkit: Buying rather*
[1:24:31] Manadr1ve: @yexulz casual
[1:24:35] telehans: Yo! What up? are you going to watch AWC?
[1:24:38] s1OOO: Did he watch the Uberboy yet chat?
[1:24:39] pkb8: soda still had 10k plus gold on his alt account they didnt take it all away
[1:24:40] Cuddle_Bunz: total lose lose for blizzard
[1:24:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @coolcoolcool777dood and get to keep the gold 😂
[1:24:44] thegreatestadam: I agree with you on that take
[1:24:46] CoolTV: that world will never exist
[1:24:49] Nok0so: better than ban would be character deletions
[1:24:54] Kuijano: @s1OOO not yet
[1:24:56] fenderisss: GDKP Mailbox was best excuse for gold selling
[1:25:00] coolcoolcool777dood: WHY DOESNT BLIZZ OFFER A NARC SERVICE. IF A NARC CAN PROVE U SOLD THEM GOLD, THAT GOLD SELLER GETS BANNED??????? AND THE NAARC KEEPS THE GOLD
[1:25:03] greu_public_enemy: man there are people that have mass exploit scaners and they crack like 1000 pc / day and they have script that install and run boots from cracked pc and they also buy the accounts from stolen credid cards that are taken by spam so gold buyers have 0 cost,there will be infinite and 4ever
[1:25:03] GooGLeiiT: im a noob, what does GDKP stand for?
[1:25:03] shmanglez: No uberdanger yet, ur good, its coming up soon, i hope
[1:25:04] ShadowLex: people are buying gold, gdkp or not
[1:25:04] s1OOO: @Kuijano TY
[1:25:06] swyftboi: So do they simultaneously not care while they're working on it?   Just seems the most aggregious offenses (Soda aside) seem to be ignored.   It seems there's a cognitive dissonance here from Blizzard and from the player; how do we reconcile that?
[1:25:06] Alaithan: Can we live in a world where blatant hackers and cheaters and sellers are banned perma?
[1:25:07] drummond777: @Xaryu AWC starting, are you watching by any chance?
[1:25:09] eeex1: So blizzard doesnt ban gold buying, but they make gold less worth by banning gdkp, hurting the farmers.
[1:25:10] parkrangerpeter: Narc system would be so funny
[1:25:17] AnyroadTwo: @thoudevon And that’s incredibly sad. A few streamers made it fun but the raids were a snooze session.
[1:25:17] Configer: its moronic to think that way0
[1:25:18] sullyman13: sting operation on the gold purchase exchange lol
[1:25:19] Nok0so: if character is deleted now your incentive to buy gold goes away because you can't buy your time investment
[1:25:22] alexgoat94: im glad he said it
[1:25:24] pkb8: soda still had 10k plus gold on his alt account they didnt take it all away
[1:25:25] coolcoolcool777dood: WHY DOESNT BLIZZ OFFER A NARC SERVICE. IF A NARC CAN PROVE U SOLD THEM GOLD, THAT GOLD SELLER GETS BANNED??????? AND THE NAARC KEEPS THE GOLD!!
[1:25:26] CoolTV: @ShadowLex yes they are, but all of the gdkp andies are buying gold
[1:25:28] Fappy23: link vid
[1:25:29] papelucho123: GDKP would be great if gold buyers and seller would get banned
[1:25:30] Reaperz_kinetic: @eeex1 gold buying has always been banned lol
