[1:08:18] DunzoCD: Lol why would he care about sponsors if they are going for the win. You will get more sponsors if you win the race
[1:08:20] AerialAce94: ending stream a few hours early is hardly some world changing event

[1:08:23] Phantomstrk: I feel that they have to win this or next raid for sure, but can't go another expansion without a win.  However, if they don't honestly, i think if they went back to being what they were before the big org, they start winning again
[1:08:29] PvtHudson093: I think they are putting to much on themselves to win which is frustrating them
[1:09:03] Rudric_Ice: co-owner like in whole or just the WoW division ?

[1:10:37] Phantomstrk: They end the stream early, do some pulls offline, best case, they kill offline and release a vod, worst case they streamline their strat.  They only have today to really kill it, otherwise i don't think it survives until EU reset.
[1:10:38] cazhually: What are you eisucissng about liquid?
[1:10:47] PvtHudson093: But dont you think are putting to much pressure on themselves especiallt when they are tilted by that many losses
[1:11:04] Effin_Steffin: Like Doc Rivers and the Sixers
[1:11:09] a_CertainDeath: makes sense
[1:11:11] AerialAce94: he's a co-owner in the sense he probably has shares, its not like Max is making decisions for anything other then the guild
[1:11:32] firewalltwitch: if they kill the boss off stream, i think it proves Echo copying them is just too much of an advantage
[1:12:04] cazhually: It would be brutal if they lost. They have been the better team for sure
[1:12:07] sinlesssinner: Max is aware of the one day head start they get every tier :) so they are going offline to try and not fail this time again
[1:12:08] AerialAce94: i doubt max would be dumb enough to sign something like that,
[1:12:16] cazhually: It seemed like echo hasn’t been robot echo
[1:12:24] cabalish: yeah, max is no noob to that
[1:12:30] fred_birkhoff: couldn't have they just turned their mics off and talked off stream and still done it on stream? @Towelliee

[1:12:56] Phantomstrk: couple tiers ago liquid (limit) accidentally killed a boss off stream lol, guess what, world didn't end
[1:13:07] danimoto10: oh so we know there is a M only phase?????
[1:13:17] PotbellyGoat: Go offline just to mess with the other teams head lol
[1:13:18] firewalltwitch: @sinlesssinner beta testing every boss isnt an advantage, they gotta wait for the nerfs every time well giving free info
[1:13:35] sinlesssinner: @firewalltwitch true
[1:13:36] Rudric_Ice: @danimoto10 no people are hoping forthat
[1:13:42] ecross208: i remember back when dexter from BL used to stream a black screen and would just put up a note when they killed a boss. Such a different time
[1:13:43] NickLeonhearth: @danimoto10 no we dont
[1:14:14] danimoto10: oh ok
[1:14:18] sinlesssinner: btw not sure about anyone else, but this tier seems underwhelming to me.. Raid bosses are all nobodies, and they are falling like flies :)
[1:14:19] cazhually: It’s kind of funny this morning echos entire strat and classes being brought has been copied to liquids
[1:14:28] Xerevil: just woke up, race ain't done yet?
[1:14:49] cazhually: So when liquid starting
[1:15:03] illStefan: how  long should a race last do you think 1 week ?
[1:15:04] cabalish: i say there is an old god thing appereance
[1:15:09] mewkittymon: Echo got to 3 faze then lunch is on now
[1:15:09] Talason: any big keys tonight for towelliee
[1:15:13] kevnil: i think echo got to phase 3 a few times
[1:15:35] danimoto10: well there is no way liquid will kill it today imo, minimum is tomorrow
[1:15:36] sinlesssinner: @cazhually just like every other raid team ever lol its like m+ metas bro, you cant take weak specs in there
[1:15:36] Rudric_Ice: max gonna go come online and say'' Guys we already won''
[1:15:47] Phantomstrk: echo casters already "crying" about off stream pulls lol
[1:15:49] sinlesssinner: @cazhually so everyone takes the same classes :)

[2:48:04] DunzoCD: thats who posted it
[2:48:14] neverbornlucky: I added a really good router because of my vr wanted wifi so its not the equipment here
[2:48:29] mavericks312: If liquid got him to 15% then this is over fast

[2:49:17] mavericks312: Echo doesn’t seem to have the killer drive this race or is it me?

[2:54:31] c0mmander_starscream: They mighty have found an expolit
[2:54:38] mavericks312: We’re gonna see more stream cutting in future tiers
[2:54:41] waelrick: they obviously know something echo doesnt

[2:56:17] mavericks312: An panic mode can affect your game as well
[2:56:25] Phantomstrk: well the trick now is that liquid needs to get the kill in a few pulls once going live, otherwise the "strat" is out
[2:56:31] captivate7: yeah @Thoreya
[2:56:34] captivate7: its pissin time :p

[2:57:32] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[2:57:45] mavericks312: They wipe them with N/A strats lol
[2:57:45] SuperLost89: "exploit"lmfao
[2:57:46] firehawk73: they cheated...lawl
[2:57:47] HopeThePriest: Unfortuanitly Its not gonna matter. Echos taken NA strategies multiple times then gloated when they won. Now they wont have that and they will lose then they will just say that they had a head start blah blah blah
[2:57:47] mrYa5h: NA EU frog spotted KEKW
[2:57:49] neverbornlucky: I still like method even if method doesn't  win
[2:57:50] rosina_scarlett: KEKW
[2:57:50] bygodwest: if liquid wins everyone will say it was an easy tier lol
[2:57:52] OnceAMoose: Max and Liquid going live is a mind fuck for Echo right now.
[2:57:56] c0mmander_starscream: Liquid has gotten their "Mandingo Dick" back LUL
[2:57:57] DunzoCD: LUL classic Chatting
[2:58:00] neverbornlucky: I'm not a  big liquid fan
[2:58:04] Mozzeyy_: Yeah but its not about the pulls though.. they have had so much more time to do tactics etc. What kind of race have two different starting times lmao
[2:58:20] ArcaneSyntax: That NA diff
[2:58:20] Phantomstrk: i think they are rattled,
[2:58:29] Phantomstrk: once that 14% news broke, they know, and it's "uh oh" time
[2:58:30] neverbornlucky: I won't say liquid cheated if they win . I'm not biased on that part
[2:58:31] CuddlyWuddly: Quite sure Liquid is gonna win

[2:59:17] psycho_scythe: @towelliee is Death Jesters in the RWF? towIgnit
[2:59:19] mavericks312: Echo about to start playing like game 7 6ers
[2:59:32] CuddlyWuddly: I wonder what they figured out to get it to 14%
[2:59:37] Collected1: yeah a break about now would be wise
[2:59:42] CDubTheRIPper: KEKW
[2:59:51] SuperLost89: @Towelliee did you see the who asked clip from max's stream?
[2:59:54] NotEnoughMana: di t
[3:00:03] ZeusDNA: Maybe they took the training weights off FiredUp and he ascended to pure god hood

[3:00:10] psycho_scythe: critroleSam critroleSam critroleSam
[3:00:14] 1kamu: saronitebombs
[3:00:22] Collected1: is there a chance Liquid did something and blizz hot fixed it?
[3:00:22] firehawk73: Liquid had to get up earlier so they didnt miss the boss nerf while they were sleeping
[3:00:23] savvy_gg: NA has the best players
[3:00:26] Shrenko: Liquid bribed devs off stream for tacts Kappa
[3:00:28] mavericks312: And if liquid wins this race you can bet liquid cuts stream in future raids
[3:00:29] c0mmander_starscream: There's some "Pre-Game" juicing going on
[3:00:35] flebbooo: hidden tech IonJam Clap
[3:00:44] Theduskflyer: They found an exploit. Kek
[3:00:49] CuddlyWuddly: Max went "HOLY SHIT, turn off the streams!"
[3:00:52] Phantomstrk: Now, imagine, Blizz comes in and "buffs" the boss bahaha
[3:01:10] SuperLost89: they found an exploit. say is with me. Sar-o-nite Bombs
[3:01:12] soysos91: I don't think Blizz can buff more right? after RWF
[3:01:25] mavericks312: @phantomstrk blizz don’t want that smoke especially after vault
[3:01:30] soysos91: This is supposed to be the "hardest"
[3:01:34] CuddlyWuddly: Bahahahahahaha, them boms
[3:01:44] Lintgamer: If liquid fouind some kind fo bug or exploit they should touch the boss

[3:01:51] soysos91: They F'd up tuning, in my opinion
[3:01:57] Phantomstrk: @mavericks312 agree.  I think they need to let it be the boss it is, and it's either just right or undertuned, but too late now really
[3:01:58] Sollice: They didn’t find a big or exploit
[3:02:07] Samurai3434: I think highly of them for not streaming those pulls. Big brained. You know whoever is in second is scrutinizing whoever is in first and copying
[3:02:11] neverbornlucky: BTW Towelliee what did you think about a lot of people not playing diablo4 because the gear drop rates were normalized during this open beta
[3:02:11] Sollice: It’s not like Blizzard isn’t watching them pull….
[3:02:14] flebbooo: Maybe mistweaver is the hidden tech EZ
[3:02:15] mavericks312: @soysos19 the tuning has been fine this race
[3:02:35] rosina_scarlett: @Sollice 100% blizz watched the 14% pull
[3:02:52] CuddlyWuddly: True
[3:03:02] Aquadriel: So when is tuning correct? Each race raiders complain "race too long" Now "race too short"
[3:03:04] HopeThePriest: Yea 8/9H pugged, pretty easy
[3:03:09] Sollice: Of course they did t. If there was an exploit or bug I am sure both guilds would be forced to stop pulling.
[3:03:18] rosina_scarlett: 100% Sollice
[3:03:44] DunzoCD: clever use of game mechanics
[3:03:58] Sollice: Yeah but new tech doesn’t mean exploit or bug

[3:04:10] rosina_scarlett: Same I want to see the 14%
[3:04:15] itswilly_g: imagine world first raiders exploiting the game lol
[3:04:15] Zansteh: no sign of a secret phase?
[3:04:27] mavericks312: This is where you can see nerves are not on echos side
[3:04:31] Phantomstrk: you watch how fast the echo pull resets happen now, not going to be 10-15 mins per pull now
[3:04:32] ZeusDNA: I'd love to see first pull 14% or better just to really mess with Echo's mental
[3:04:36] itswilly_g: didnt they exploit the game when DF first dropped? WF raiders ya? w rare glitch?
[3:04:37] OnceAMoose: Chef Heidi better have some amazing breakfast this morning.
[3:04:47] Akermay: Think they'll beat it before reset?
[3:04:48] Broomba: they prob tried new different combo of classes
[3:04:48] CuddlyWuddly: :D
[3:04:49] neverbornlucky: btw towelliee we will know after the event. Everything comes out afterwards so that is why I do not think they exploited
[3:04:49] savvy_gg: Where is the proof they hit 14%?
[3:04:57] Contendedlemon: yeah its usual 1 death 1 hour meeting
[3:04:58] codefiveone: they're sloppy now
[3:04:58] rbolude: they gotta catch up
[3:04:59] Dagomarus: I doubt they reached 14% more than once

[3:05:04] Broomba: they are in panic free for all
[3:05:06] DunzoCD: @savvy_gg warcraft logs
[3:05:08] soysos91: Max went on
[3:05:13] mavericks312: Echo saw 14% and changed there game completely
[3:05:16] Thoreya: max just said "its dead any pull"
[3:05:22] CuddlyWuddly: Aye!
[3:05:22] captivate7: max is talking to us now lol
[3:05:40] CuddlyWuddly: Wooooooooooo!
[3:05:47] Phantomstrk: that's slappin it right on the table
[3:05:51] DunzoCD: they coming in with that black mamba mindset today
[3:05:52] neverbornlucky: towelliee reminds  me of the old days when we didn't know the streaming and had to wait til things were reposted of video after world first
[3:05:54] NotEnoughMana: boss die SMOrc he says
[3:05:58] firehawk73: panic pulling
[3:05:59] ZeusDNA: I hope they murder sark super quick so they have a full day to celebrate
[3:06:03] rosina_scarlett: they 100% have a strat that echo will try to copy
[3:06:07] WhatYeti: man I hate RWF season, it always gets me back into wow lol
[3:06:12] Theduskflyer: They aren’t out of their minds players. Amazing for sure
[3:06:21] CuddlyWuddly: For sure!
[3:06:21] medanmarko: Good ol, throw bodies at it until it dies, strategy :) One has to stick!
[3:06:22] waelrick: this early and at 14% has to tilt them
[3:06:24] mavericks312: Well yea cause echo now knows there on a 6-7 hr timer to kill or this race is out of there control
[3:06:34] rosina_scarlett: they going in now
[3:06:36] captivate7: they're about to start @Towelliee
[3:06:47] soysos91: man, what if Echo makes a comeback lol
[3:06:50] Dagomarus: Well echo is used to being behind so i doubt they are overly shook
[3:06:53] rosina_scarlett: Max stream is showing
[3:07:12] mavericks312: @soysos19 they could but there mental are shook
[3:07:15] Redpandalol: @towelliee dosent demo have some kind of sub 20% execute? Double arms warrior for executes. Big pumping
[3:07:20] rosina_scarlett: this is the furthest they have been behind in awhile
[3:07:28] soysos91: They should get in game and do a handshake line :D
[3:07:30] CuddlyWuddly: This makes it more exciting, I'm sure Echo got lots from Liquid last race
[3:07:33] TweektheProphet: @Dagomarus they are use to being behind in the race until the final boss it a different type of behind
[3:07:37] mavericks312: @dagomarus nah man they probably didn’t think liquid would be a whole 14% on them
[3:07:41] neverbornlucky: I'm so high that they all look the same to me towelliee
[3:07:48] a_demeaning_cow: Max’s focus and attitude yesterday was unlike the last 3 races. It was refreshing!

[4:00:56] Holysal: @KingSlayerYotam thats bc the splits for the first 4 days too
[4:00:57] rosina_scarlett: Liquid just really don't have random deaths like  Echo does
[4:01:06] emznev: Bfa was pog
[4:01:11] Eviltuna13: Eco is like let them win but don’t make it look like you let them win. I don’t know loose casually
[4:01:13] DeanoTV: ye not as much interest in DF

[4:01:37] Theduskflyer: The middle race doesn’t matter as much. It’s good to win, but it’s meh. It’s the first and last races that matter
[4:01:38] Lintgamer: its only 7AM in NA people going to miss the kill
[4:01:43] HopeThePriest: No I just want to see scripes face when he loses

[4:01:46] LethalGamess: I love WoW, and i miss wow, but i dont play. nothing about it excites me about it like it used too
[4:01:47] emznev: Molten core harder than this
[4:01:57] savvy_gg: Echo should just just watch liquid kill it live on stream while they stream.

[4:02:02] Choppsuuey: Method is hot on Echo's tail

[4:04:13] neverbornlucky: I'm here  till diablo4 comes out then I'm going back to the diablo community
[4:04:15] ArcaneSyntax: DF didn't sell as much, but it's retaining a lot more people.
[4:04:25] Gingerprimer: NGL DF is on track to become to best expansion of all time for me at least
[4:04:25] emznev: Why doesn't asmon stream on his main twitch account?

[4:04:56] SpaceGhost_Druid: any WOW ads on Facebook is just people who dont play wow complaining about wow in the comment section
[4:04:57] Shrenko: I love Dragonflight and people shit on it, but there is so much more than just doing m+, raid and pvp
[4:04:58] LethalGamess: I dont watch asmon, is he toxic or something?
[4:05:01] Alienfromger: he has to fuel his hatred towRage
[4:05:01] DunzoCD: its also way loess grindy for 1 character this expansion so he doesnt have to play much
[4:05:04] Griffo525: I just don't like the story in DF, love everything else
[4:05:07] Eviltuna13: Was leveling last night in shadow lands and ran into a ton of people playing that expansion
[4:05:23] zysmos: he's still saying it's too hard lol
[4:05:28] ziiakk_: to much going on thats why he dislikes it
[4:05:28] Gingerprimer: @mavericks312 nah Belluar is more of a way of the wind guy
[4:05:28] tydrennistv: hes an influencer now not a wow streamer
[4:05:33] Nasilvera: he really hated the last boss in the raid
[4:05:35] firewalltwitch: @Towelliee i think the crazy stuff that happened to his ORG the last year is a reason too, hes on his alt perma
[4:05:46] 1kamu: from outside df seems like a disney expansion
[4:06:10] VrtniPatuljak: he hasnt streamed on the main channel for months, dont think he cares about content

[4:06:31] bd142001: Agreed
[4:06:36] Akono_1991: test
[4:06:36] Nasilvera: haviing a one stop npc for all gear upgrades is cool
[4:06:40] HoboFighter2: Honestly its kind of a bummer that D4 is coming out during this time, I love DF, but I am gonna put it down for D4 for a bit
[4:06:46] abilitytogoeven: theres also other esports going on, CSGO major, league tournament etc

[4:06:54] PigPenLen: bingo
[4:07:00] Gingerprimer: @mavericks312 easily top 2 for me

[4:07:11] Broomba: ion listened and responded
[4:07:11] VrtniPatuljak: not just twitch, internet loves drama
[4:07:12] capitan_3steban: true DF is pretty good, so there is nothing much to bitch about. lol
[4:07:17] Jaghatai: Negativity just made me quit the game instead. Got tired of being fed up with the game during BFA and Shadowlands.
[4:07:21] OnceAMoose: Also 10.1 upgrade system, while a tad confusing at first. I love it.
[4:07:22] Tehsunman: thats why trash tv is so popular @Towelliee KEKW
[4:07:23] Phil87z: I feel like shadow lands burned a lot of people out. It’s a shame df is good but some people are just done with Wow
[4:07:28] neverbornlucky: so Towelliee are you saying wow needs a j k rowling moment
[4:07:30] LethalGamess: thats cause all the players quit their subscription lol
[4:07:32] tylerwithghosts: I always take a break in the second season/major patch of every xpac, DF is the first time I not only haven't done that, but also still login every day to play. DF is very very good.

[4:08:20] Zeraeb: The reason I'm not playing DF is because I gave up on retail wow after the last expansion, I just cant do games that want me to log in on a schedule anymore
[4:08:21] Tripl3dot: yeah they had 2
[4:08:28] llNoTToXiCll: WoW wasnt bad at all it was just led in a very bad direction and hopefully DF can steer WoW back in its general direction of being really good as it once was
[4:08:28] LethalGamess: More viewers = bad expansion (because no one is playing the game. Low viewers + good expansion because people actually playing the game
[4:08:31] Jaghatai: Oh this song is from Cataclysm.. remember listening to it on the Collector's Edition CD.
[4:08:40] Kisswani: @theDirtyon3 I refuse to believe he has a standard mage LUL

[4:10:06] Malarick: Not their tier.   Last tier Echo played out of their minds.  This tier is Liquid's

[4:13:43] Poorfortune: I always look at pull count.
[4:13:43] Phantomstrk: 10 hours only depends on if you actually pull the boss when it's available, which they both dont, so then you have to factor in splits, as well as whoever hits bosses first, showing bugs, stopping for fixes, etc
[4:13:56] Phantomstrk: Hot Take, Echo takes break cause they lose, and method passes them...omg the maulding
[4:14:05] pavepawns: take a break order some food and relax if they lost
[4:14:06] Shrenko: turn up the volume on Echo stream and listen to the convo LUL
[4:14:09] theDirtyon3: amen

[4:14:26] Malarick: if you ain't first, you're last
[4:14:27] soysos91: and the stream equipment
[4:14:30] Bernardo994: i'd rather be 2 than 5
[4:14:31] pavepawns: 3 more attempts and then kill
[4:14:32] t_train_va: @i_tilr Are you EST?
[4:14:35] pavepawns: calling it
[4:14:36] Horseweave: @towelliee is it wrong of me to look forward to MDI races than Raid RWF?
[4:14:36] theDirtyon3: @Soysos19 liquid players were complaining about being cold
[4:14:38] theDirtyon3: lol
[4:14:47] dreamwalker213: @soysos19 I would imagine the AC is on full blast
[4:15:03] Hazzar2k5: 0 hunters
[4:15:07] Hazzar2k5: :D

[4:17:27] emznev: Blizzard should give money to 1st 2nd and 3rd place kek
[4:17:28] pavepawns: i do wish they could do more for the casters and screen setup for the liquid teams channel. cause its lacking alot compared to echos
[4:17:41] mavericks312: Echos healing could be there undoing

[4:18:56] theDirtyon3: @LethalGamess this isnt FF that doesn't happen LUL
[4:18:56] NobodybetterPat: Lol
[4:19:10] tylerwithghosts: Echo's Mistweaver absolutely pogging out though
[4:19:12] tylerwithghosts: thats awesome to see
[4:19:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's going to die today
[4:19:26] Phantomstrk: yeah, so this is the clock i was talking about, the tilt only lasts for so long then turns to motiviation if liquid can't get back to 14% or lower consistantly
[4:19:46] soysos91: spriest on top? :O
[4:19:53] theDirtyon3: Echos has too sleep soon
[4:20:08] waelrick: theyre struggling to get back to their best
[4:20:08] mavericks312: Echo also has dinner and to decide if they stay up late today
[4:20:12] Phantomstrk: it's 4:16pm for echo

[4:20:16] PvtHudson093: 5ish hours

[4:20:27] Daarksyde: if there are levels (going up or down phases) then the assumptions dps/heals numbers will be skewed
[4:20:29] geokouts: 5 or 6 maybe
[4:20:35] emznev: Could go for at least 6 to 8
[4:20:35] Phantomstrk: If liquid keeps getting close, Echo may decide to call it with dinner
[4:20:35] brunothesheltie: Is this mythic?
[4:20:37] aceventus: it has to do with echo's healers I would imagine @Towelliee. Their HPS are lagging hard behind liquids
[4:20:43] Eviltuna13: Mom get the meth we raiding all day cohhParty
[4:20:43] daniel85mg: Liquid on the driving seat, is their race to loose now i think
[4:20:43] mavericks312: I doubt they go to bed in the next 4-5 hrs
[4:20:48] theDirtyon3: i think it dies by liquid before Echos dinner
[4:21:01] Phantomstrk: well let's face it, evoker healing was busted last tier

[4:21:13] theDirtyon3: liquid can kill any pull tbh
[4:21:16] mavericks312: Situational healing is the difference
[4:21:20] Akono_1991: anyone know why im not making any progress on my stuff?
[4:21:21] LethalGamess: a true gamer knows no sleep
[4:21:32] Phantomstrk: it's liquid's race to lose right now
[4:21:37] mavericks312: Yea echo isn’t in the any pull kill
[4:21:39] emznev: Imagine method gets world 2nd
[4:21:45] emznev: That would be crazy
[4:21:54] theDirtyon3: Man what if there was a secret phase now....

[4:22:02] Phantomstrk: liquid needs to kill it in next 3 pulls, my anxiety can't handle it lol
[4:22:22] mavericks312: And there struggling to get sub 45% every pull now
[4:22:28] surpriseparty20: Even if this race looked easier I'm glad the tuning wasn't so degen like the 2 previous raids . It didn't feel like the teams found a wall like in vault and sofo
[4:22:29] Niksen_99: Nice haircut towel
[4:22:30] warrenny: 4%?
[4:22:30] theDirtyon3: the only thing that saves Echo is a secret phase now
[4:22:30] Malarick: Liquid needed to kill it today. If this went through reset Echo may have caught them
[4:22:38] Daarksyde: they scurred
[4:22:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Have we gotten to the secret mythic phase? LUL

[4:23:12] abilitytogoeven: they know last phase now, they just need to get there
[4:23:37] 0doz: Did echo changed too many players from last race?

[4:23:39] Phantomstrk: this is where the "head start" kind of plays to echo's favor, at the end of the week, before reset, typically liquid has the stress of getting it done "last day" and echo has another day so they can watch vod's, chill, etc.  But now liquid is on the doorstep, and echo isn't sub 20 yet
[4:23:42] marineboi1288: liquids healers are more on point than echo
[4:23:45] mavericks312: Liquids bars health bars just don’t move
[4:24:20] theDirtyon3: Liquid extends at this point i think even if they dont kill which i doubt
[4:24:21] Eviltuna13: Crazy to see so many holy priests this tier
[4:24:37] c0mmander_starscream: It's Mandingo time
[4:24:42] Effin_Steffin: what's the lust phase
[4:24:46] theDirtyon3: yeah
[4:24:53] Phantomstrk: it dies today
[4:24:54] TexValhalla: lust is on pull
[4:24:55] emznev: What's the chances no one kills it today?
[4:24:56] NobodybetterPat: Music is prefect lol
[4:25:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: THe hole stacking is kind of neat to see
[4:25:01] theDirtyon3: its sub 10 min fight
[4:25:04] theDirtyon3: unlesss....
[4:25:04] Phantomstrk: short of a complete collapse or some tech issue, it dies today
[4:25:07] mavericks312: If for some reason it doesn’t die today liquid 100% extends with how low there getting it
[4:25:11] Nebulizer87: one good pull w/ an immunity picked its dead
[4:25:14] TexValhalla: there is no point to lust through the buff because you get constant haste buffs when you go down
[4:25:20] Ertra: @theDirtyon3 enrage is right around 8 mins
[4:25:20] LethalGamess: Liquid go it to 4.5%, its going down today

[4:25:29] lovemymage: sylvanas
[4:25:30] Holysal: I like this bc theres no reason to be harder imo
[4:25:32] Asyia3: Method killing jaina?
[4:25:36] warrenny: Xavius?
[4:25:39] Theduskflyer: Jainia
[4:25:52] Skobble: Are we sure there is no secret phase?

[4:26:05] Holysal: @Theduskflyer method won

[4:26:10] Ertra: @Skobble yes... unless it's at 3% lol
[4:26:24] Shrenko: @Ertra can trigger at 0% too
[4:26:31] theDirtyon3: this could be it for liquid if they stay clean
[4:26:32] warrenny: Sanctum and sepulcher were echo?
[4:26:32] mavericks312: @skobble I mean he was down to 4% an nothing so unless it’s a 1% no there isnt

[4:29:01] 0doz: How is method doing?
[4:29:02] SuperLost89: @Towelliee alright, ive had enough. you need to stop watching Liquid raid so they can kill it :D
[4:29:04] Theduskflyer: You can argue, Noah, is a big moral booster. I’m not saying he’s a make or break tank, but definitely some glue to the team.
[4:29:17] mavericks312: Yea echo can’t even get sub 38% to figure out a strat
[4:29:22] Baz4k: whats up man?

[6:21:38] the_bad_goat: Liquid isn’t going to get it. Trust me
[6:21:41] disaster_jasper: One part of the fight known is like 10 to 20 pulls needed by echo to find the issue not including the fix
[6:21:42] Emwaveuk: Is it not just execution at this point the boss doesn't have any mechanics left to figure out?
[6:21:48] Nehcrom: At least we got a suspenseful race going :)
