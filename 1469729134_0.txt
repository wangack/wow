[0:52:59] Desertrage78: corner back*
[0:53:03] cryonic805: they yeeted the whole qc in bizz did they
[0:53:04] MILESkg21: they would rather the community do QA
[0:53:11] HijarL: well...i'm a side job games tester...so..they could hire freelancers
[0:53:26] SageRuskiy: Yeah
[0:53:37] JediNeo99999: An internal QA team can't do near the amount of testing inviting players can do
[0:53:38] SageRuskiy: its self inflicted, like a challenge mode kinda
[0:53:55] HijarL: @JediNeo99999 very true
[0:54:00] Amarlian: During the interview, Zion also talked about testing systems like how they wanted and received feedback on tier gear during this last round
[0:54:08] Amarlian: Ion not Zion
[0:54:21] HijarL: meanwhile...blizz ruins the lore...
[0:54:37] CantHealz: QA will make sure things are funcgtional... Allowing more players test it on PTR allows for edge cases to be caught that wouldnt get caught by a QA Team
[0:54:47] pattar101: i dont watch beta
[0:55:09] pattar101: ya true
[0:55:14] LorienV: @Towelliee I feel like everything is spoiled 6 months before and once we get the game we are already burnt out. Theres no sense of mystery anymore.
[0:55:24] Amarlian: I thought the last three bosses blind was a good amount for WOW
[0:55:41] LorienV: @Towelliee The problem with wow is if you arent in the "Know" your behind in a game like wow.
[0:55:42] Eithos87: I never go into a game blind. I like to know everything I can about a game before ever playing
[0:55:45] MoistyBlizz: as a current CE player, the second ANY content or preview is available my guild has us tudying it lol we DONT go in blind haha
[0:55:54] HijarL: i basicly watch the lore...and when i play..i watch it again ^^
[0:55:55] letsrock_pt: dont like that, feels we lost all the surprise
[0:56:00] Dange: true... happends to me with the latin comunity
[0:56:05] D3m0nHunt3r666: if you get key as well, hypes everything up more. Happened to me in BFA
[0:56:14] Carryout: I like watching Beta just not playing it. I did BFA beta and got burned out 2 weeks after release
[0:56:19] MisterD1rty: @Towelliee you try SV venthyr et? its really fun.
[0:56:20] Mecabeast: how the beta goes is a swing vote for people coming back imo
[0:56:23] manmower: they should surprise with the story isntead
[0:57:11] D3m0nHunt3r666: i want my weapons Kappa
[0:57:13] abracka_: wow raiding is just lemme smash and get purples
[0:57:26] HijarL: glad to not be like that...at least not in total ^^
[0:57:39] Kaldah: Too many leaders with not enough rich storylines about any of them
[0:57:49] LorienV: They have to see it, to be ahead. They dont really have a choice. TBH
[0:58:31] moistf1ngers: is SL worth getting back into for someone who only played 1 month at release
[0:58:34] Superhumanjesse: coming back to Azuresong?
[0:59:20] Desertrage78: first 4 picks. Edge, Edge, CB and CB
[0:59:22] MILESkg21: !SCENE :)
[0:59:29] Mourningztar: Im offended.. lol
[0:59:36] faulen: your scene is still in the WoWhead review
[0:59:39] Darkgx5: @towelliee do you think wow will get a comeback with the new xpack?
[0:59:41] manmower: no glad stance means they don't care about warriors
[1:00:07] Armdel: two deaths before any mechanics, this looks promising
[1:00:15] MILESkg21: typical LFR KEKW

[1:14:00] MisterBongwater: priest could be interesting, if they choose to bring boon or mindgames forward
[1:14:17] Armdel: he mentioned like in the interview with asmon i think, talking about artifact powers, azerite powers and covenant powers all having a chance of being in the tree
[1:14:42] SageRuskiy: Yeah he basically said that instead of the classic boring passives, we will have stuff from legion weps, azeroth neck etc
[1:14:57] SageRuskiy: Which is pretty great now that its all in 1 system instead of a grindable one

[2:04:26] Cerbrus0: valor cap makes sense during the beginning of a patch but haver a 1/2 month just remove it
[2:04:27] manmower: clash of clans warcraft

[2:10:55] ArcaneSyntax: they should get rid of the flat boring utility
[2:10:57] jeffnsteff2019: offically made a horde
[2:11:24] HijarL: just make mission table a mini game...add some fancy graphics and loot boxes and here you go

[2:15:35] JonnyScotland: @jeffnsteff2019 explain, why?
[2:15:40] Malnar1123: Cross Faction Guilds would just make things so much easier...really odd that Blizzard is doing a lot of work to eliminate the need for external programs yet is basically telling people to go download discord no matter what.
[2:15:46] Malnar1123: I get people have it anyway but still
[2:15:57] KaisenSiru: Pog
[2:16:02] ArcaneSyntax: I like the alliance a lot aesthetically but I've been horde for 15 years and there's too much history as horde.
