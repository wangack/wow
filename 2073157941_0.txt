[3:49:19] theodorn88: no one eats kfc around here, they hit Chick-fil-A or Popeyes for fast food
[3:49:22] Enbex: dont ask monkaLaugh

[3:49:33] TheMercDeadpool: That's top secret
[3:49:36] body_type_two: stray dogs

[3:49:59] Bebisita: when I was in Bulgarian grocery stores, some things were a lot cheaper then in Kosova
[3:50:02] hiro25000: ship stuff on controlled temperature is very expensive.
[3:50:03] Bebisita: so I guess not only chicken price
[3:50:05] ZetItUp: english in chat
[3:50:33] theodorn88: most people just buy quality chicken instead because price point is crazy, why pay $48 for fast food.
[3:50:42] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety
[3:50:45] Cannilad: other than fast food being expensive, is the living expenses in bulgaria decent?
[3:50:55] Bebisita: for example a pack of strawberries was 3 leva, and in Kosova it was double the price
[3:51:04] AnnoyedNurse: but McDonalds does the same. They go to farmers, tell them they need that much Chicken or Potatoe or whatever- That Farmer has to get his farm bigger and then they lower the price and the farmer has no choice but to go with it- its a scam

[4:33:26] Bootch: KEKW
[4:33:32] LillaJeon: Wow for pve? About 95% or more KEKW Pvp is a mini game sadly
[4:33:32] oldirtybrucie: pve is good
[4:33:35] neugassh: 90% of the player base probably
[4:33:39] wtfcantfindname: there's more people that pve than pvp i think
[4:33:40] Red_Dead_Redeem: I use it to destress
[4:33:51] triggs390: if you queue from the homeland you get priority

[4:34:03] ZetItUp: cba finding new "friends" KEKW
[4:34:04] LillaJeon: @wtfcantfindname It is, and it's not even close. I think pve is about 90% and pvp is 10% of the player base AT MOST
[4:34:04] bassiemon123: 10k well spend
[4:34:06] Bootch: oh god I started a war

[4:39:10] Red_Dead_Redeem: league used to b my jam, but then I realized how stressed I was getting KEKW
[4:39:19] LillaJeon: @StripSniper There is some truth to it. Most players who like pvp, play games that are 100% pvp focused. Such as league, dota, csgo etc. mmo pvp a niche because it's just a mini game within a much bigger game

[4:44:03] jefrow420: i have never play the other
[4:44:08] LillaJeon: @Bootch And in mmos it's "easier" to get a name for yourself because it's a smaller community. So if you play pvp consistently you'll run into familiar names. No one will remember little BoobyQuickscope54 in Fortnite because he's one out of millions
[4:44:08] Bootch: ooh arcane was AWESOME
[4:44:12] Red_Dead_Redeem: welp I gave her some treats to say I'm sorry and she is content, now if only gf's worked that way KEKW
[4:44:12] Bootch: cant wait for season 2 yeah
[4:44:13] Ruinx81: Arcane was so good
[4:44:22] Bootch: arcane was very good world building"
[4:44:25] ZetItUp: still havent seen season 1 LUL

[4:44:58] LillaJeon: @Bootch The whole community was a big part of pvp for me tbh back in mop ish when I played
[4:45:05] Ruinx81: all the characters just say epic one liners

[4:53:21] MezeiPoloska: every online community has the toxic elite, thats how it works
[4:53:23] LillaJeon: @PsheroTV The more annoying thing is that the raid is so easy that you can clear fine without world buffs and flasks, but somehow people act like it's mandatory
