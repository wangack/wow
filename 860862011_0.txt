[1:19:56] Lazugo: thing that the jailer tried to do on arthas
[1:20:03] Malindan: Anduin is shown as an old man in one of the comics but they might retcon I guess.
[1:20:05] kharditv: ok the what about Arthas when uther threw him in the maw

[1:21:06] pereadin: Yeah halls is my lowest key still have only a 12 2 chest in time xD
[1:21:07] SorionTheGinger: @Nixieed you mean the one where the jailer holds frostmourne? thats just an ancient old memory of the runecarver if you ask me

[1:22:21] Digidan2005: good games yesterday, man
[1:22:26] nixxy_7: Necrolord story is great... i think that Primus is gonna be KEY to this story by FAR!!
[1:22:26] omezy23: @binkz77 YouTube sylvanas decision
[1:22:27] ShadyWizWolf: @Veramer Don't think we've seen Tirion in SL yet. Uther, yes.
[1:22:31] nixxy_7: Once he awakens
[1:22:37] Fallensinner_: I slap like a wet noodle does that count?
[1:22:41] HotHotHeals: that first boss is scary
[1:22:54] kharditv: what about Arthas
[1:23:00] lel3owski: oce, bad server
[1:23:02] Slitze: austrailian
[1:23:04] Xedeffen: Oceanic
[1:23:05] ShadyWizWolf: OCE lol
[1:23:06] NewWorldReign: Honestly I think Anduin WILL be turned into the new LK or whatever, then someway in the next raid dungeon we beat him down halfway to remove the corruption.
[1:23:08] rosina_scarlett: OCe server
[1:23:19] metavahn231: how do you get the time to show up next to the name?
[1:23:26] ShadyWizWolf: I really wanna see Tirion in SL @Towelliee :(
[1:23:28] lel3owski: im exactly the same IO as you, hpal, i could login, i have a 14 top too lol
[1:23:33] PercussionGun: why does the jailer need all the anima though ?
[1:23:43] nixxy_7: @kharditv all we know so far about arthas are the kyrian cinematic and jailer cinematics about arthas , uther , and the jailer cinematic about the frostmourne and helm that he was the one that created them
[1:23:50] Lunarsear: hey towelliee how's it going
[1:23:56] ElPolloBatman: because the jailer wants to make anime
[1:23:56] Fallensinner_: There's a few realms that give bad ping if they invite.
[1:23:57] omezy23: Anduinn and sylvanas dies this xpac
[1:24:02] nixxy_7: @kharditv mostly everyone thinks arthas is coming back blizz baited him to hard this exp his definitly gonna comeback :)
[1:24:06] Jlohh: Get the quelthalas guy
[1:24:12] ShadyWizWolf: Tho a Bolvar-Tirion reunion would be a bit.. awkward.
[1:24:26] metavahn231: some people have high IO but are really terrible at certain dungeons
[1:24:31] rattyinajacky: all these poeple just coming back what about all the bad peeps any of htem could come back to right everyone talking aobut uther and tirion etc. 🤔
[1:24:37] kharditv: @nixieed so why anduin where Arthas is already in the maw somewhere
[1:24:38] xavier2119: your bastion phial removes the necrotic stacks @Towelliee
[1:24:44] Malindan: We have a lot of potential for a silver hand reunion this xpac
[1:24:46] Scubaskot: !armory
[1:24:47] Moobot: Towelliee's main character | worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/illidan/towelliee
[1:25:02] nixxy_7: Its gonna be super weird if Blizz just baited Arthas comeback with all those cinematics and story and just cut us dry at the middle of expansion :)
[1:25:05] metavahn231: i had this shaman who had a 10 in mists but had never done a sanguine depths
[1:25:17] omezy23: Uther will probably be a raid boss
[1:25:18] tweed99: @Towelliee how do you get the io to show next to the ilevel
[1:25:21] f_ckita: !addons
[1:25:21] ShadyWizWolf: Then there's Uther ego stroking all over Bastion. LUL
[1:25:21] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[1:25:39] HotHotHeals: isnt arthus in the maw now?
[1:25:44] kharditv: yes
[1:25:53] TwistedSaint: wouldnt bringing Varian back instead of Arthas make more sense?
[1:25:54] Bearrdman: arthas to knock some sense into him revealing he has been his father this whole time Kappa
[1:25:55] nixxy_7: Arthas is already dead they cant bring it back @Towelliee some of the primus explained to us , once your DEAD, you cant comeback, we are alive in the maw not DEAD
[1:25:55] ElPolloBatman: better don't even think about redeeming arthas
[1:25:59] GiraffeHydra_: Arthas Wrynn making a surprise appearance
[1:26:01] pereadin: His father is probably an agent of the Maw so we might see Papa-duin come back for a skit
[1:26:01] Aervyper: @Towelliee if they make Anduin into the Lich King then his dad will come and save him
[1:26:03] Lunarsear: like a "have the redemption i never did" thing? :P
[1:26:03] SergeyT16: what's the addon that shows people's raiderio next to their ilvls in group finder?
[1:26:04] Zettabyte: they're mawlding together alright
[1:26:07] HotHotHeals: im ready to some naruto shippuden reanimation arc
[1:26:10] porter981: porter981 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:26:12] nixxy_7: @Towelliee We, Anduin,Jaina,Thrall are alive in the MAW not dead, we enter unwilling in the maw so we broke a Rule Code
[1:26:19] nixxy_7: @Towelliee but were still alive and flesh
[1:26:21] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee The soul fragment Jailer pulled from that thing, you think that has to do something with Arthas, so Anduin can be a new Lich King?
[1:26:24] Jeffblute88: I want to know where Tirion Fordring is hanging out at
[1:26:25] Redacted_: no redemption arcs, arthas and sylvanas need to burn
[1:26:32] PrisheBurningBlade: Jaina and Thralls orc Baby is going to finally make an appearance, and solo the jailer, and be the final boss of the expac
[1:26:35] ShadyWizWolf: What if that thing (soul fragment) that was hammered into his sword was Arthas's soul? 👀 @Towelliee 👀
[1:26:45] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed Anduin cant bring his dad back either, he got turnd into fel ash by Gul'dan.
[1:26:56] nixxy_7: So we can go back if we want in the real world, Azeroth as long as we dont die in the maw and become bound by the Shadowlands Death
[1:27:10] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign we might see Wrynn there
[1:27:19] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign we cant bring the dead back , but we meet to many characters in hte maw
[1:27:20] Sincline387: what if the soul fragment is varian.....serve or your daddy is doomed
[1:27:27] kajun_predator: Raider IO isn't a skill based system. its a crutch that people like using to assume how good a player is. its terrible. @towelliee

[1:27:30] pwnage187: what best Covenant for unholy dk?
[1:27:32] pereadin: It gives it the ability to hold souls
[1:27:32] ElPolloBatman: that sword is the jailor's buttplug
[1:27:32] rosina_scarlett: @Towelliee what do you feel about the rumor going around that the Runecarver is the Primus?
[1:27:37] Malindan: Tirion died before the machine broke so he is somewhere other than the maw since ursoc went to ardenwaeld still. Maybe patch zone?
[1:27:40] swordart_19: INFINITY STONES CALLING IT NOW
[1:27:51] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed As you said before, the Primus mentioned that once you're dead, your dead
[1:27:53] kalmenus1: The Mourne the Merrier
[1:27:58] ShadyWizWolf: @Sincline387 monkaS
[1:27:59] Malindan: Shalamalalamourne
[1:28:12] omezy23: Nah varian got killed by fel magic that deletes your soul or some shit
[1:28:15] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Anduin is the new Lich King, mark my words Kappa
[1:28:17] pedrodepacas1: its not a skill based system, it just gives ytou more points for doing harder things :D
[1:28:18] kharditv: @masumii3 what if he is rinkaHmm
[1:28:19] nixxy_7: @Towelliee Blizz can go so many ways with this, we saw to many dead characters in the MAW, Draka, Kael,Vash , (we might see arthas and wrynn too) etc it might be crazy interactions between Jaina,ANduin, Thrall
[1:28:25] swordart_19: People with no score using excuses KEKW
[1:28:32] rosina_scarlett: @kharditv right! so much evidance suggests he is
[1:28:33] Lazugo: Blizzard have a system that show people who complete keys? No! So RIO is everthing that we have
[1:28:37] Gluwc: when you're doing +15 you want someone who knows what's up
[1:28:41] Ezekyler: what if it's a fragment of Azerite and 9.1 is Return to BFA monkaS
[1:28:41] Malindan: Yeah variant was dusted
[1:28:43] NewWorldReign: And besides, Varian cant return because Gul'dan burned his ass into ash.
[1:28:45] swordart_19: @lazugo it does but it is not in game.
[1:28:51] swordart_19: @lazugo armory
[1:28:53] RageerPLZ: Isn't that stone similar to our Soulkeepers, if you think about it we are running around with our own personal frostmourne able to take in souls and release them.
[1:29:03] kharditv: @masumii3 TO THE VINDICARR
[1:29:14] pereadin: Love itt when people do that smileW
[1:29:17] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign yap but will be fun to see if we and the 3/5 characters that enter the MAW alive can get out ALIVe, or some remain there forever if they die
[1:29:17] jamieandos: Wonder how flying in SL will work with the in between bit from oribos to the areas ...
[1:29:22] pereadin: Yeah butt we need lust
[1:29:24] tempestmemes: only if he is outlaw
[1:29:37] yisa123: both of the players have a 50% chance to suck , so better take the one with better stats to reduce the chance of him being absolute shit
[1:29:44] pereadin: I do not
[1:29:48] casualboomer: Just grab a hutner or mage?
[1:29:50] Malindan: I want to see the maw before oribos was built. The ruins hint at something.
[1:30:08] dutchie76: Make BM hunters great again! Lol
[1:30:08] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign Am soo curios if Thrall will meet Draka, if anduin will meet Wrynn , if sylvanas will meet Arthas , and Jaina so far they dont know of each other existance... but Draka is Baroness in Necrolord area
[1:30:20] PadidinJones: The maw syncing is such BS!
[1:30:34] th30dor: drugs monkaS
[1:30:36] casualboomer: did you change platforms in the altars of agony?
[1:30:44] Lazugo: @pereadin you you can control the mob to give 2% + dmg to party, right?

[1:30:48] metavahn231: nerfing drums was kinda dumb, back to always needing shaman/mage/hunter
[1:30:49] nixxy_7: Imagine Anduin meeting WRynn body in the maw: Father!! your ALIVE!! Wrynn: NOP still dead son
[1:30:57] pereadin: @lazugo too much of a dps loss to do that
[1:31:01] jojospunk: xav -> 1st room of gorechop -> kul -> gorechop again for prideful on every boss but 1st and last
[1:31:11] nixxy_7: Or thrall meeting draka be like: MOM !!
[1:31:14] Lazugo: @pereadin just for that pack
[1:31:23] Mallaes: The ideal route is to go down to Xav, then up to the lich area and then left to the abom area, I think
[1:31:25] metavahn231: monk always has too many buttons
[1:31:26] Lazugo: @pereadin its a huge boost
[1:31:28] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed Hw can Anduin see his father again after Gul'dan burned his body up in Fel on Legion?
[1:31:42] ZetherTV: bajFL RareParrot bajFR
[1:31:57] CDubTheRIPper: dcwHmm
[1:32:07] Molvonos: Depends on the group. If you have a DK, you do Xav last, so you can MC big inspired add in the last group, take it with you for Xav and Last boss.
[1:32:11] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign everything that dies goes into The Shadowlands no matter how it dies, we saw Vash, kael, Draka, etc etc many characters that had more awfull deaths
[1:32:20] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign all souls go there :)
[1:32:29] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign so we might see Wrynn as a Soul :)
[1:32:39] metavahn231: next week is sanguine oh god
[1:32:39] casualboomer: So I always have prideful for xav, then go to caster boss, then gorechiop then end boss
[1:32:41] kharditv: @nixieed oh snap
[1:32:48] wise_JESTER: ToP + inky black potion 🧪 is interesting
[1:32:56] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign as we saw Draka as Baroness , or vash as Baroness of the Necrolord , or Kael as subordinate of Advocate in Venthyr
[1:32:56] Molvonos: inspired buff on group is nice
[1:33:16] CDubTheRIPper: you cant touch sanguine most weeks with a `10 foot pole LUL
[1:33:26] Lazugo: if the the dogs leave sanguine on the last part im gonna be pissed
[1:33:33] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed Dont forget about Garrosh too, how will he react when he sees Thrall?
[1:33:40] casualboomer: SD is a pretty great dungeon when everyone does what they should
[1:33:53] casualboomer: PF hurts pugging. alot
[1:33:54] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign thats what the peeps were expecting at wf race to see Garrosh and thrall meet again
[1:34:01] kharditv: @newworldreign pretty much they duke it out again Kappa

[1:34:10] dutchie76: My favorite dungeon is Spires
[1:34:12] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign but thrall is still in Torghast dungeons captive, so we might see Garrosh appear in other area raids when we free Thrall :)
[1:34:20] dutchie76: Done it 30 times already
[1:34:23] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign So far i only freed Jaina atm working on Thrall and Anduin quest atm
[1:34:24] NewWorldReign: @kharditv And Garrosh wins of course, no elemental spells.

[1:34:37] omezy23: Those whispers voljin heard
[1:34:43] bdsffgg: what is the new cinimatic?
[1:34:46] almaperdirdo: rrdz23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[1:34:50] nixxy_7: @omezy23 we will this takes back to Voljin prophecy :) and all voljin and velen prophecy were true not 1 was wrong
[1:34:53] kharditv: @omezy23 it's bwonsamdi boss that did it
[1:35:32] omezy23: @kharditv The de other side boss?
[1:35:35] nixxy_7: @omezy23 actually Velen prophesized in outland it was : that Anduin will be the Bridge between LIGHT & Dark, but our Anduin only knows Light magic atm, Shadowlands might be the place where he develops Dark powers
[1:35:37] kharditv: yes
[1:35:48] NewWorldReign: Towelliee released Thrall from Torghast though, unless he isnt going to be included until a later cinematic
[1:35:53] nixxy_7: @omezy23 and all velen prophecies came true remember that :) he can even foretell lies bc of his unique trait
[1:36:14] omezy23: @nixieed Yeah very interesting
[1:36:15] Molvonos: except dark doesn't equal death.

[1:36:25] nixxy_7: @trevybnasty i havent found him yet just informat of him :) waiting for quest update next week to see if i free Thrall next
[1:36:34] Molvonos: dark could be death, could be void, coudl be something else. Just like Light doesn't mean life.
[1:36:36] monteblare: who is doing his designs ?
[1:36:48] nixxy_7: @omezy23 the fact is people forget older expansions, and blizzard LOVEs to bait us with small hints along the expansions :)
[1:36:54] nixxy_7: @omezy23 that later fill in like a puzzle
[1:37:31] nixxy_7: I am still curios if Sylvanas will reveal the prophecy VOljin told her in her ear: before he died in siege of ogrimmar
[1:37:51] nixxy_7: because Sylvanas always was secretive and never trusted anyone to share stuff so we might not find out what Voljin said on his dying Breath
[1:37:54] casualboomer: are you going vers > haste > mastery?
[1:37:57] nixxy_7: that made Sylvanas Shocking
[1:38:15] Molvonos: I hope she doesnt.
[1:38:24] swordart_19: FUCK TREE towQueen towQueen towQueen towQueen towQueen towQueen
[1:38:25] Molvonos: She legit needs to go fuck off.
[1:38:29] PercussionGun: does anyone even want her to have one?
[1:38:33] Sovekz: Hopefully not, she is beyond that for a long time
[1:38:33] swordart_19: Alliance spotted @Molvonos KEKW
[1:38:36] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed Maybe Sylvanas is the key, and Anduin isnt? Cause doesnt she have the same powers as the Lich King?
[1:38:41] Sionz: Anduin becomes the new Lich King
[1:38:43] nixxy_7: @trevybnasty light magic (holy can be priest or pally now idk how that affects him in the wow universe :) i tend to think of him as a priest
[1:38:46] Gorestack: I just hope they remove the bitch from WoW for a while, she's been the center piece for 3 expansions in a row
[1:38:49] RenaShirow: @trevybnasty he was trained as a priest and has always been a priest.
[1:39:01] Molvonos: @swordart_19 Wrong bucko. Been horde for the last 8 years.

[1:39:17] GucciDownToSocks: Prideful will get messed up if u dont skip the big boy going into gorechop boss. The one in the circle @Towelliee
[1:39:30] swordart_19: @Molvonos your mouth speak alliance aka baine and thrall peacekeeping fanboi KEKW
[1:39:32] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign but she didnt kill us, she could kill anduin,us and everyone there and send us instant to hte MAW and the jailer
[1:39:36] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign but she didnt?

[1:40:09] swordart_19: @Molvonos yup you are alliance
[1:40:15] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign i think this will have to do something with voljin , bc what voljin said , made sylvanas Shocked soo hard you never saw sylvanas that shocked not even when arthas killed her
[1:40:18] binkz77: and buff gear drops
[1:40:19] metavahn231: its funny how they nerfed DK mastery by 15% and they still on top
[1:40:33] PercussionGun: well, artificer on tyranical is fun Kappa
[1:40:37] Molvonos: @swordart_19 You hit your head this morning or what?
[1:40:38] dutchie76: Think some class changes happen this week?
[1:40:39] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign we still dont know what voljin told sylvanas only the Spirits, Voljin and Sylvanas know
[1:40:42] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[1:40:49] nixxy_7: and maybe Bowmsandi but he didnt told us in BFA what voljin knows
[1:40:55] 8bitbarbarian: yo @TheCliffyShow
[1:40:58] NewWorldReign: Come to think of it, Sylvanas left Varian to die in Legion and never explained why. Maybe thats why she left Voj'lin to die too.
[1:41:09] kharditv: @molvonos @swordart_19 always be like that
[1:41:18] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign she didnt let him to die it was 2 sides of a coin story i saw
[1:41:22] th30dor: is it the jumpy trash? monkaS
[1:41:27] Molvonos: @kharditv That's unfortunate.
[1:41:29] th30dor: the one with the 100% healing reduction?
[1:41:31] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign i dont play horde but i watched and someone recorded both story cinematics for alliance & horde
[1:41:31] NewWorldReign: Cause she knew Vol'jin has clse ties to Bwonsamdi.
[1:41:34] Ronangic: he can be CCd... he is the only one
[1:41:42] swordart_19: @Molvonos noah i like warchiev stands for war not peacekeeping and you smell like alliance KEKW
[1:41:49] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign and in the horde one i saw the horde was stopped on his tracks to save wrynn by the legion but the alliance didnt knew that
[1:42:03] Ragzen: good day
[1:42:03] kharditv: @molvonos see what I mean
[1:42:07] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign on the alliance side story cinematic : i saw wrynn die and alliance thought horde left him
[1:42:14] kharnij83: what addon changes the mouse cirsor to a O
[1:42:21] nixxy_7: so its 2 sides of a coin cinematic Horde and Alliance for Wrynn death
[1:42:23] Ronangic: you can CC the inspiring mob... just not the ones it inspires @Towelliee
[1:42:25] Molvonos: @kharditv Yea, homie's getting put on my ignore list. That's just silly.
[1:42:25] kappaday23: Keepo
[1:42:26] Sovekz: @swordart_19 Being a Sylvanas simp KEKW
[1:42:31] Tauree25: @Towelliee U know u could've shroud that pack right?
[1:42:51] osatox: prob because you pulled the start of dungeon mobs first instead of skip
[1:42:53] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed Yeah, the Horde left with Sylvanas while the other half with Vol'jin were massacred.
[1:42:55] swordart_19: @Sovekz always kill the alliance and weeklings towQueen better than being no spineless fanboi peaceloviáng allanice simp playing horde KEKW
[1:42:57] nixxy_7: @trevybnasty remember azeroth was left in state of decay and chaos after we enter portals
[1:43:39] nixxy_7: i think what sylvanas know and what voljin foretold will be the key to tell us where the Next expansion will go
[1:43:53] nixxy_7: most likely 99% sure why would blizz keep that secret 3-4 expansions
[1:44:23] 8bitbarbarian: did a +4 top yesterday on an alt and everyone was doing mechanics...i was shocked
[1:44:23] NewWorldReign: @Nixieed And somewhat Vol'jin gave her Warchief via Bwonsamdi, and with her being a banshee she can read the minds of other races.
[1:44:35] Redacted_: what time you doing the ulduar run towelliee?

[1:45:19] Spekky: think hunter getting a nerf soon? should i wait before i craft legs on my alt hunter?
[1:45:31] NewWorldReign: I think Sylvanas was bribed into burning Tel'drasill and gathering all of the night elf souls for the Jailer himself.
[1:46:05] NewWorldReign: Cause if she was gathering them herself she could of killed verybody at orgrimmar.

[1:47:07] Sovekz: not*
[1:47:24] swordart_19: I hope whole horde council dies towHorde
[1:47:51] nixxy_7: @NewWorldReign exactly and you know voljin is not insane to do that without knowing, especially since voljin can see into the future too like velen but different through the spirits and the Loa :)

[1:48:06] NewWorldReign: @Sovekz No one knows that yet, and why would Sylvanas obey a troll spirit and not the Jailer?
[1:48:16] lolyouwildwyd: @Towelliee how you enjoying your new guild?
[1:48:18] casualboomer: Timewalking was entirely not worth 200 ilvl gear this week
[1:48:18] Sionz: thoughts on TBC Servers @Towelliee
[1:48:21] swordart_19: I have heard Ulduar timewalking gives more loot than Castle Nathria is it true ?
[1:48:21] Sovekz: @NewWorldReign He literally says that when you do the dungeon
[1:48:26] casualboomer: should have been 213 reward for that much pain
[1:48:33] Molvonos: @NewWorldReign Because Muez'ala works for the Jailer?
[1:48:36] Halomateo: @NewWorldReign yes we do, meuh'zala is working with the jailer...
[1:48:57] cameron3332: BC Pog af
[1:49:01] bob_tables: what ilevel does ulduar timewalking give?
[1:49:04] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @trevybnasty (warning)
[1:49:11] NewWorldReign: Sylvanas is working for the Jailer, NOT Meuh'zala.
[1:49:15] kappaday23: Kappa
[1:49:23] th30dor: the existence of BC implies Wotlk is coming. Now that's going to be Pog
[1:49:23] Bearrdman: theres no way they wont let us copy our classic characters i feel
[1:49:23] Slitze: @swordart_19 dropped a grip of loot
[1:49:25] Molvonos: @NewWorldReign Mueh'zala's working for the jailer too, man
[1:49:30] Ezekyler: the swarm of Blood Elves paladins
[1:49:37] mobbo: I don’t have fond memories of BC
[1:49:46] 8bitbarbarian: i would assume classic servers just become TBC servers...won't satisfy everyone, but are people just going to play on Classic forever with no new content?
[1:49:47] Aervyper: @Towelliee BC classic is gonna suck..... It's gonna be just like Classic it's gonna be all min maxed out the wazoooo. I LOVED BC but they can't recreate that with BC Classic

[1:52:00] NewWorldReign: @trevybnasty Honestly, I think she will turn on the Jailer, perhaps kill him in a later raid and somewhat return to Horde.

[1:52:28] 8bitbarbarian: in which case you just capitulate against the Bills
[1:52:38] Sovekz: @NewWorldReign Hopefully not, that is beyond trash, she doesn't deserve redemption, and horde would be moronic to even consider taking her back
[1:52:47] ErneShew: Ravens opened as favorites against the titans

[1:54:50] omezy23: Henry will run through the ravens like last year. Titans defense is suspect though
[1:55:13] Sovekz: @NewWorldReign I want to be a billionaire, but it doesn't work like that, it would be bad story telling if a genocidal maniac gets redemption and everyone then forgives her

[3:00:42] jure__: you can only do Ulduar once per char right?
[3:00:56] MrGattz: @propwash80 i wouldnt say its better off, when doing stuff like group finding for dungeons its cross realm anyway. if you are looking to get into a guild and do m+ runs and or raiding then i would suggest moving to illidan or area 52 with your horde toons. or just making new ones. its not super time consuming to level new toons.
[3:01:01] jure__: sadge... went with my hunter, no weapon :(
[3:01:06] TheItalianStallion321: 4? i literally got 1 piece from CN this week

[3:51:13] smashwow: tab targeting is always screwed
[3:51:16] bmwhockey: Theres a circle cursor that also shows you the GCD, just started using that
[3:51:17] andyz_: u guys going for the +3?
[3:51:17] jordzkie05: on POE and WoW, i need a giant cursor
[3:51:23] bmwhockey: super cool
[3:51:25] kniftty: @Towelliee the next thing to headcase yourself with will be changing the color of the cursor WA, and the shape of it

[3:51:43] bidogau: Its on WAgo.io
[3:51:44] skdmaster: Thats the GCD one
[3:51:44] Akunin_EQ: TAB targeting in Torghast will get you killed, damn vases
[3:51:49] Thunderbrew: Grats to the Colts for making the Playoffs
[3:51:55] kniftty: its the same wA they just added another circle inside of it to represent it
[3:52:05] Vivelli: does the circle do the reducing thing on the GCD one?
[3:52:07] Vigi9413: @Towelliee we're gonna have to get JT jerseys now
[3:52:11] jordzkie05: i want the mount
[3:52:16] Kaykerrs: Hi @Thunderbrew <3

[3:52:30] BurtMacklin410: i wish i was but wont be able to unlock it because the story is gated for some weird reason
[3:52:34] Getitonthelow: how do you get the mount?
[3:52:57] skdmaster: GCD has a one static circle and another to show the GCD and another to show spell cast

[3:53:42] bmwhockey: the GCD one i use is literally the same circle as towellies but the circle itself fills in to show either GCD or spellcast (whichever is longer)
[3:53:45] Thunderbrew: No catch up for Torghast sucks.
[3:53:45] jordzkie05: also the beastwarrens world quest has a chance of dropping the mount
[3:53:59] jordzkie05: which is currently buggy af atm
[3:54:06] Vivelli: how did that hit you?
[3:54:06] Thunderbrew: If you are just starting WoW now you are screwed on Torghast I guess.
[3:54:12] Vivelli: looked like you were out of that
[3:54:17] 91Niki: How did that even hit you?!
[3:54:17] Sollice: You looked clear
[3:54:20] bidogau: Its not an "old" thing...When mouse looking with the camera the Cursor disappears. And mouse look is +

[3:59:14] pereadin: I honestly feel like +20's and highers should give 233 loot
[3:59:25] plumpus81: When are you forming Ulduar? I'd like to bring my Havoc DH - 200 Ilvl
[3:59:41] luckfore: pvp gear has way to high ilvl
[3:59:50] MacSancho: !microphone
[3:59:55] Freeks417: @towelliee what addon marks the names of the different sections in Oribos for you?
[3:59:59] Squidnapped: that and isnt verse ww monk main stat? pvp gear just OP for WW
[4:00:13] smashwow: if pvp has multiple options to push rating to get 233 then 233 should come from M+
[4:00:21] MacSancho: @Towelliee what microphone is that?
[4:00:31] Rimstar: are m+ not balanced then gear wise?
[4:00:31] Leeon: yes
[4:00:32] Zadentv: yea
[4:00:34] jordzkie05: m15 should be heroic raid equivalent imo
[4:00:37] Zadentv: and rbgs are ez
[4:00:48] pereadin: Yeah rbgs are the way to go tto get 2400
[4:01:14] DarkForce_TV: HandyNotes: Oribos
[4:01:28] Freeks417: @darkforcenl ty!
[4:01:28] ExtreemeCheese: It seems like pvp is the best way to gear given that a full mythic clear will give you 1.5 pieces of 226 and M+ only gives 210 max
[4:01:30] pereadin: Thatt would be balanced if you weren't able to upgrade all pvp gear to 233
[4:01:46] jordzkie05: @Towelliee i think were technically just time-gated for gear as PVE for the weekly, 10 weeks later this wont be as much of a problem pve progression wise
[4:01:49] ronpearlman: gotta keep that /played time up

[4:02:21] Rimstar: i still have 184 slots because of vault being rubbish
[4:02:24] Mecabeast: id rather get a token from the vault i save up to buy a specific piece of dungeon or raid gear
[4:02:24] Thunderbrew: @Towelliee do you know why there is no catch up for Maw/Torghast?
[4:02:28] Fensmarken: @Towelliee the problem isnt how good PvP-gearing is IMO - Its how absolutely fucking trash everything else is in comparison
[4:02:32] shashfps: pvp is sweatier than its ever been, 1600 feels like 2k
[4:02:37] 91Niki: What ilvl does uldar drop ?
[4:02:44] jordzkie05: also nathria boe's.
[4:02:46] jordzkie05: jesus
[4:02:58] Ka5h3d: Ulduar is dropping 200
[4:03:01] jordzkie05: you can get more boe's in 4 hours than actual 4 hours heroic progression

[4:03:39] Ka5h3d: @TheCliffyShow No idea but if you're 59 then wait until you're 60 to run it
[4:04:04] bulletsight: what shoulders does he have on ?
[4:04:16] Getitonthelow: ran under got 1 piece of loot... glad it was at least a weapon though, but some fights a mechanics just can't tank and spank
[4:04:27] jordzkie05: xavius heroic/mythic
[4:04:27] Ka5h3d: @TheCliffyShow The only difference between a 225 and 235 leggo is the stats on the piece are higher, the legendary effect isn't made any stronger by the ilevel increase
[4:04:29] smashwow: and some of the ulduar gear is actually insane from there. plus you get more pieces on avg per boss from TW raids
[4:04:41] jordzkie05: tfw ulduar gear is better than nath
[4:04:45] jordzkie05: better stats too
[4:04:52] Ka5h3d: The scaling on some pieces is insane
[4:04:53] TryAtomic: RIP Jarod Nandin
[4:04:59] jordzkie05: not a crappy mastery-verse bracers/shoulders
[4:05:23] Rimstar: ulduar gear basically all has haste too
[4:05:31] Rimstar: pretty good compared to nath
[4:05:55] jordzkie05: yea shadowlands gear in general seem to hate haste-based classes atm
[4:05:57] Ka5h3d: Depends on your BIS stats
[4:06:05] jordzkie05: the fact that haste gear on nath is a goddamn BOE

[5:22:33] smashwow: if you're looking down to see CDs. WAs will help if you start hiding your action bars. if you're still looking at the action bars for button presses. well there's a whole other issue there.

[5:56:30] shimwood: That Druid left themselves behind as far as I'm concerned LuL
[5:56:35] danksly: all im sayin is theres a button there
[5:56:48] DrRockso85: so what youre saying is...press the red button got it
[5:56:59] MARTZiiE: I live like 45 minutes away from Indianapolis I can’t even tell you how much Indy fans hate Philip rivers, most of them would rather have brissett starting
[5:57:07] badjujukid: listen, if the button was green, maybe, but the button is red, you have to press it
[5:57:11] smitebot: adds

[5:59:19] turtlle: Colts should sign Winston from the saints
[5:59:49] Holysal: indy will trade for Stafford
[5:59:58] EhhPaisano: Just remember Frank Reich was there went Carson Wentz was actually playing his best in Philly.
[5:59:58] MARTZiiE: I just feel like because he got paid along with his age may have been equal to rivers success, work around Indy is the colts are going to start Jacob Eason next year
[6:00:09] EhhPaisano: Won't be surprised to see him in Indy
[6:00:27] ottavianni: what u think about wents to colts , he wasnt the same without reich ?
[6:00:40] donuts420glazeit: KKona Clap american lore

[6:11:12] donuts420glazeit: Mogolo a good arms is rly good in arenas and mage is not bad at all
[6:11:29] Mogolo: yea i dont pvp only pve
[6:11:37] wrathos_23_soundpower: Do /range 16 it really helped us kill it yesterday.
[6:11:42] Karbonn: This boss is bugged where his random dot he puts on people is a one shot for anyone near them and he heals a LOT.
[6:11:44] Mogolo: havent pvp'd since wotlk lol
[6:11:46] kodtheog: @Towelliee are any of these pieces better then the current xpac gear
[6:11:58] kodtheog: ur right
[6:12:03] pereadin: I agree
[6:12:05] saltocracy: YES IT IS
[6:12:05] Asuo_: Fire mages are some of the best burst in the game right now - I wouldnt focus on what world first is doing if thats what your considering @Mogolo
[6:12:08] MaddoxStefan: ye
[6:12:08] aikopooh: agree
[6:12:09] swordwindgaming: doesn't make sense to make an alt because of the soul ash debt
[6:12:13] ExpoUhl: I can't even gear up one
[6:12:14] DannyG757: sup dude
[6:12:14] ManneehFresh: the honey moon phase ended
[6:12:15] kodtheog: cuz torghast changes every week too for our legendaries, wb, covenant etc
[6:12:16] Murlocz: It is actually, specially considering how vault works
[6:12:17] saltocracy: but for some reason folks love it and its annoying AF
[6:12:18] pereadin: I have 5 60's I'm trying to keep up with and I just gave up on all except one
[6:12:18] haderdaraide: this is my favorite expansion tbh, im having a blast
[6:12:21] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: thank god torghast features are accountwide
[6:12:22] TrowGundam: The Renown catch up is shit, I've been stuck at Renown 11 despite being 18 on my other character
[6:12:25] EyecuGaming: i am finding its not fun trying to keep up either
[6:12:29] wrathos_23_soundpower: I love this expansion tbh
[6:12:31] tebbix: Thorgast is literally hell for alts
[6:12:33] spyrit14: gearing up is slow from world quests
[6:12:34] sqwshtv: i struggle doing all the maw stuff on more than 1 character
[6:12:38] oldmandinkleberg: wasnt that always the point of alts tho
[6:12:42] haderdaraide: I really love this expansion, its my favorite, im having a blast
[6:12:46] swordwindgaming: only way to gear up alts sensibly is through BGs and arena
[6:12:47] oldmandinkleberg: less geared then your main
[6:12:52] Tobizh: thats why i only have mount alts since legion
[6:12:53] Murlocz: Torghast is dogshit and the vault is very alt unfriendly
[6:12:58] Kinghorn: just won a level 60 mission table for a mount with level 35 dudes, thanks necrolords
[6:13:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: alt leveling friendly Kappa
[6:13:03] Buffalojesus1: renown catch up is really quick though
[6:13:03] tdpark_: and time consuming
[6:13:07] Cosmolus: There are no catchup mechanics for gear and torghast
[6:13:08] raldrik: You will have BIS on everything in a couple of weeks which will free up time
[6:13:09] thedarkaegis: I think torgast unlocks and catchups need to happen sooner than later. Ion talked about it coming when he was talking to sloot.
[6:13:09] oldmandinkleberg: if they all have the same gear and legendaries and stuff arent they all sort of mains
[6:13:11] Mogolo: @sqwsh4 i struggle doing maw on one lol dont like the zone
[6:13:11] hoyhoy007: I have 4 chars and its burning me out to keep up
[6:13:15] 1godofwar0: i dont look at alt friendly as all my toons being equal
[6:13:16] ohaithurr: @Towelliee depends on how you see it, my alts I don't do the daily maws, I do the callings, I don't do Sanctum aggressively on them since the Sanctum is optional and not game priority besides renown. And the 10 a week is only if you want full loot, I just do a +10 each on them and call it
[6:13:37] Ramstein: just got to 60 on my 5th toon and I'm getting that lil bit of burnout feeling
[6:13:41] TrowGundam: Ya, the maw is a chore jsut on one character. Trying to do that on multiple is just, hell naw
[6:14:12] rektongles: words
[6:14:12] Naturalbeef: I'm just working on leveling all classes to 60 in my free time
[6:14:13] Ramstein: oh hell no i don't do the maw on more than 1 toon or i would KMS
[6:14:37] oldmandinkleberg: no someone just died
[6:14:38] Azurehax: World of Warcraft players are the prime people that don't actually want to play the game.
[6:14:45] hoyhoy007: yes there`s a curse that heals him
[6:14:45] wrathos_23_soundpower: You leach 5000hp per second you need to split /range 16 @Towelliee
[6:14:46] VictorAvalanche: need to spread 15 yards
[6:14:46] oldmandinkleberg: he heals for like 6 to 9 % every death
[6:14:53] hoyhoy007: melee seems to be stacked
[6:15:09] ohaithurr: I do my maw weeklies, my renown weeklies, and Torghast weeklies, and some M+'s

[6:15:26] shimwood: WoW has interrupts? Kappa
[6:15:29] Kromede: pump up the jam catJAM
[6:15:29] ohaithurr: I never see alts as characters you do EVERYTHING you do on your main, that's just not possible
[6:15:52] moonscryer: monk is op for most fights in Ulduar.
[6:16:16] Kromede: talking in music titles Kappa
[6:16:17] Ramstein: that's how i did BFA, I only did everything on my main and geared alts through world quests/dungeons
[6:16:49] Akunin_EQ: Here comes the peek
[6:16:51] Kromede: "did u say walk in?" Kappa
[6:16:53] jerexify: So charge in immediately? Got it.
[6:17:04] FrozenShades: @Ramstein I really wanna level an alt but feels like its horribly slow right now
[6:17:06] raldrik: LERRROOYYYY JENKINS

[6:17:15] Azurehax: That's never gonna be case.
[6:17:27] Mogolo: timewalking
[6:17:33] foxies_havocing: i fuckin hate alts
[6:17:38] Ramstein: it's ridiculously fast if you do the normal story mode and then when you are level 59.99% switch to Threads of Fate asap @FrozenShades
[6:17:40] Gladiator816: Just came back from a long hiatus time talking wasn’t a thing before lol
[6:17:42] Drakenking: Meh, my alts are for farming mounts tbh
[6:17:49] Drakenking: Ive played my rogue for 13 years
[6:17:50] anithics: never had an alt
[6:17:52] Kromede: actually me not so more, i deleted a tons of alts FeelsBadMan
[6:17:53] saltocracy: The last time Gear was easy to come by fast was Wrath honestly
[6:17:56] anithics: got multiple 50's but only 1 60
[6:18:00] wrathos_23_soundpower: @XxGLADIATOR816xX yes I farmed so much 200 i lvl items yesterday :D
[6:18:02] jerexify: @Ramstein But then don't you have to fill the bars still?
[6:18:10] spyrit14: That's where FFXIV is better 1 character, many jobs.
[6:18:11] Ramstein: @jerexify what bars?
[6:18:13] ohaithurr: @Towelliee I have 5 toons all heroic geared and I play maybe 3 hours a day on weekdays and 6 on weekends, I don't do 10+ M+'s a week on alts, just a +10
[6:18:19] wrathos_23_soundpower: Trinkets from here on 200i lvl are literally insane
[6:18:29] Mockle: 10 year old raid still not bug free lol

[6:18:32] TrowGundam: That's why I like FFXIV's class system. It isn't perfect, but you have at least 2 and sometimes more classes taht overlap gear, so you can easily play other classes without being completely behind
[6:18:32] jerexify: @Ramstein The percentage bars for Threads of Fate, where you have to do WQs, objectives, etc. for each zone.
[6:18:50] Kromede: braaaaaainz
[6:18:55] Ramstein: Speaking of Altoholics, did you hear that the guy in charge of the Altoholic addon(not the creator, cuz he retired) made it so TotalRP3 addon didn't work and that caused the creator of Altoholic to un-retire? ramste2Lul @Towelliee
[6:19:09] moonscryer: at least two wipes inc.
[6:19:15] FrozenShades: Or something PepeLaugh
[6:19:29] Ramstein: @jerexify I'm not sure but those are just similar to the "Bonus Areas" and don't take as long
[6:19:36] stingeruk: You can kill the brain with lust easy firsr go round
[6:19:52] Mockle: you can one shot the brain
