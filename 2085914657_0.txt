[1:12:56] IAmJoey: I like how people are calling echo lucky, while they actually got unlucky on goliath with 2 resets cuz fire spawned on top of the boss and meeres got really unlucky on thorns and the death on the first pull is a big time loss.
[1:12:56] Bashiel: @syriosone partially
[1:12:58] insaner_g: @dolmeniq naaa echo its the best team ; its not a lucky game only the best team win

[4:33:51] tftserenity: @Fierced well see who wins
[4:33:52] Wikedlyrics: @joxiusby you know if they nerf them there will still be the same classes in every run, they would just be different ones
[4:33:56] Moredotshc: @joxiusby no point in balancing around runs that can be done by 0.1% of the players, if even
[4:34:06] IRLAnthiel: @joxiusby what is played in MDI is not indicative of what is actually OP on live since what is being played is not the same game on live. TGP is a more accurate representation of what is strong

[4:37:57] Fierced: @priestop1232 No they do not. you realise every dungeon gets planned and practiced with the comp they want to play it with? banning classes means they'd have to practice like 10 setups. that wouldnt be possible to get down cd wise.

[5:16:07] Knifferoo: @DSDjinn Blizzard communicated season 4 as a return to the Dragonflight dungeons and it just makes sense to bring them back since they've only been in one season each
[5:16:11] KitteNat: @BigD530 Those would be horrible x(
[5:16:58] Sebleh: Blizzard has announced multiple times that S4 is the base 8 DF dungeons and the raids on rotation.
