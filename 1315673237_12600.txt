[3:31:06] Defocus: you can hear bobby voice when you highlight over "buy more" Kappa

[3:37:57] GTokie: in d3 you can craft them too at ur level
[3:38:00] SixPointFive: I do like that they went with a hybrid gear approach, with upgrades on the main pieces and then finding loot on the other pieces
[3:38:00] Kenobi3380: how big is the inventory?
[3:38:02] Rottencoarse: @trexbitesize  yes :)

[3:38:52] Speedglass: ill spend $20 easy
[3:38:53] Billo0w: like bellular KEKW
[3:38:59] Akira_Waifu: Do you feel this game was hurt more by its announcement and how it was handled? Cause it doesn't look terrible tbh

[3:39:09] BUHzar: ppl dont understand mobile games make $$$$$$
[3:39:12] Speedglass: $20 should get you all the way
[3:39:22] Kurtlicious: You only need the $5 Battle Pass.
[3:39:31] Speedglass: spend it on gems and crafting junk
[3:39:31] ciryc: ay, if they're using that money to make more pc games, im happy
[3:39:31] zoulce: is there going to be pvp @Towelliee ?

[3:39:43] Ashanty: @Towelliee what glasses are you using.?
[3:39:48] SirVoro: $120 gets you all the way in most triple A games
[3:39:53] lonestar456: how do u get the battle pass
[3:39:58] Speedglass: there's a $.99 cent deal for new gamers atm
[3:40:03] PulseImpulse4565: Elysium_Echo subscribed with Prime. 
[3:40:04] SirVoro: Halo infinite was $140 I think
[3:40:11] dalaraz: 120$ wont getyou enough gems if you wanna top in pvp or ladder,if you dont care you can just play free
[3:40:11] Kenobi3380: how big is the inventory?
[3:40:30] Speedglass: for the price of a cup of coffee you can tip your developer a dollar
[3:40:32] zeitgeiz: I can’t pass up on the deal on faction changes, even if I don’t use it now. Battle pass will have to wait
[3:40:35] SirVoro: @dalaraz I was talking about just battle pass. to max it out in most games is like $120
[3:40:43] Aquadriel: he is anti blizzard KEKW

[3:42:39] refluxuations: People can't because they need someone else to tell them if they should do something.
[3:42:39] justnthyme: But why do we have to be OK with mobile games being such a lower standard than any other game industry?
[3:42:40] Zmey35: other countries arent accustomed to american freedom

[3:42:48] TheTokyoDevil: they dont live in the real world

[3:43:03] rbayduden: Exactly
[3:43:05] SirVoro: @justnthyme Because they aren't being made for you if that's your opinion
[3:43:06] TheTokyoDevil: its all fallout 76
[3:43:07] Shugaze: they want another outrage to make content and get views
[3:43:09] bingo5556: YEP
[3:43:11] Kultak: privileged
[3:43:11] jimmyboyalbrecht: are you using a controller ?

[3:43:23] AmChooka: 100%
[3:43:26] GiantBaconChickenWaffles: monk is really tough to play
[3:43:27] Dalrend7640: i mean those are basic narcissistic tendencies @Towelliee they just want to get attention

[3:43:34] redcomet81: when is it supposed to be up and running for everyone
[3:43:34] keto_tv: @Towelliee hi. how can i see online numbers on servers?
[3:43:36] mellzor: We can, just download it and play .. its only harder to find, thats all, they are not blocking it
[3:43:37] Voluntaristgirl: its a free game ... you do not have to use the shop and it is your own money
[3:43:38] mikejames01: @Bonussize Truth here man
[3:43:39] justnthyme: @Jasondelco It's objective it's not a subjective opinion, worse UI, worse predatory design, they're objectively worse than any other industry
[3:43:45] nm_ritko: why does the preload button not work for diablo immortal
[3:43:50] SixPointFive: There is an argument that there are people out there that can't help ruining themselves.  But they'll find a way to do that regardless
[3:43:50] sinestro0: people's mouths get in the way of their dick ngl
[3:43:51] justnthyme: we should be allowed to hold them to the same level of quality or standards any other game is held to
[3:43:55] AmChooka: Extremely based toweliee
[3:43:57] Thorkad: the only complaint I have right now.. it doesn't show up for me on the Google store at all -. -
[3:44:01] watter10: the industry is dying so people chip in
[3:44:09] Akira_Waifu: Can't enjoy a video game without it being a political issue
[3:44:12] MILESkg21: the store is always optional but people will be pissed just cuz it exists
[3:44:13] rubberduckie0_0: they can adults cant peddle trash its more of a quality control
[3:44:18] BadPenguXD: the whole game is mindless dps no?
[3:44:35] Orsen8: lmao the industry is not dying
[3:44:36] sinestro0: ^
[3:44:37] Bonussize: @justnthyme holding them to a standard and just complaining to complain is different. No one is holding a gun to your head and making you play/pay
[3:44:41] keto_tv: @Towelliee hi. how can i see online numbers on servers?
[3:44:49] DevilSpire: hell we can't enjoy anything without it being political
[3:44:51] SixPointFive: I just hate that there are so many whales that these games are viable.  Takes resources from actual, good games.
[3:44:52] Rockysteel: industry is far from dying, i dont understand where these people are getting information
[3:44:57] TyleriumGaming: industry is dying haha
[3:45:00] showmethesugar35: Is it available on android?
[3:45:03] zaddyZyco: as a Belgian, i dont mind
[3:45:04] TyleriumGaming: That is hilarious
[3:45:09] reflectthestorms: Immortal is like D3 2.0
[3:45:14] vetbro: The thing to watch is how Immortals model does and how they'll implement this into Diablo IV
[3:45:15] Moobot: antichals, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:45:21] Voluntaristgirl: its a governmnet thing
[3:45:21] Bogzeh: why would they let u play the game if u cant be a customer
[3:45:27] Voljere: I wish all the games just had shop enables and shop disabled servers so it could please everyone.
[3:45:29] TimsGamingDen: The guy who decided to get the law introduced here in belgium is a 65+ year old minister from a catholic party.. says enough :D
[3:45:31] Akira_Waifu: Fair but even then an adult should be able to decide if they wanna spend instead of a government babysitting them kek
[3:45:34] Voljere: but imma play em reguardless
[3:45:36] Kurtlicious: !guides

[3:45:38] sinestro0: might just be blizzard dying?
[3:45:38] Aquadriel: if they disable store, blizzard has no gain from that country, so they might as well dont spend resources in support game for that place.
[3:45:40] lilcutefawn: It's hard to enjoy a game when they squeeze the juice out of you, even for someone who has job the cost is a bit ridiculous
[3:45:45] rubberduckie0_0: i mean its a pretty easy solution for the company
[3:45:46] lonestar456: how much for the battle pass
[3:45:52] kalamari__: more EU countries will follow BE/NL in this. so companies will have to give these options
[3:45:58] krazykashflow: Do you think it’s possible to clear these before the time runs out ?
[3:46:02] 5hoe: Man, you just said it! The data from these games is hyper-valuable as well.
[3:46:03] ripripripripripriprip: cute how people defend this greedy bs, i understand streamers do since they getting paid to bend over but regular people is just sad
[3:46:09] reflectthestorms: The Immortal Cosmetics look fantastic
[3:46:11] bobbydons: I mean, regulation of micro transactions and mobile games has nothing to do with limiting what people choose to play. That's a strawman argument through and through. In reality, the belief that regulating private companies limits consumer choice is a complete fabrication. The regulation of the companies and their predatory methods protects consumers.
[3:46:14] Rockysteel: @haruchin you have dont have to pay anything though
[3:46:17] xseaka: Gambling is a serious issue, it's funny to watch people downplay it so much
[3:46:17] 5hoe: Blizzard getting access to mobile user-data is $$$
[3:46:30] vavvor: are you playing it on pc in 2hrs?
[3:46:34] Akira_Waifu: I assume the battle pass has cosmetics?
[3:46:38] ReKalibrate: those people will also keep the game populated. More players, faster party queues, more seamless play for others. I don't see the problem
[3:46:39] SixPointFive: @xseaka It's a serious issue, but also a personal choice
[3:46:42] Speedglass: i relish rank progression its one of my kinks
[3:46:58] kalamari__: @bobbydons exactly. agree 100%. its not a ban of the game or not letting ppl play. its the companies not following the law
[3:47:00] vic_ave: No asking what they are doing in Rifts think of the Social Contract
[3:47:01] Smokey16: @Towelliee Idgaf about mobile games, they're shit but im not gunna play em so idc, what i do care about is blizzard subletting one of their IP's to another dev and adding a SHITLOAD of mtx to it. Dont give a shit about mobile games but this opens the door for a bunch of trash
[3:47:10] Cacos: I see it like eating food. Sure that you can plant and collect all ingredients and cook them but if you have access to money you can just go out and eat. It's abou accessbility not gaining advantage
[3:47:11] lilcutefawn: @Rockysteel and then I feel miserable playing because I can't progress normally like the whales do.
[3:47:12] sinestro0: even though monk is hard to play, is it worth to play into end game?
[3:47:22] tuskum0: does anyone know a good server on est for diablo immortal
[3:47:24] xluckydawgx: @Towelliee gotta thank you for introducing me to Factor, been my go to for a few months now
[3:47:27] BeardedKuhn: probably already asked/answered,  but is there cross save for pc/mobile versons
[3:47:31] xseaka: @bobbydons this exactly thank you
[3:47:39] AmChooka: @beardedkuhn yeah
[3:47:41] Voluntaristgirl: yes its cross save
[3:47:47] DanSZK: is this elder rift the "end game" content or you're still in campaign?
[3:47:49] zaddyZyco: I actually support what our government is doing. Even tho i dont always support them. It sucks for sure, but hopefully it changes the way gamestudios handle things in the future (sorry if it is an unpopular opinion)
[3:47:55] BeardedKuhn: @AmChooka nice, ty for reply
[3:47:58] Speedglass: wow you have a horsey
[3:48:00] xHaziell: is the ui different if you play on pc?
[3:48:27] Rockysteel: @haruchin is this a real statement? Why do you care, just enjoy the game at your own pace, if people wanna drop money on fake stuff let them lol.
[3:48:30] regulater45: is this a new diablo game?
[3:48:31] Speedglass: hey man you showed us a new game that just came out
[3:48:35] Shugaze: hopefully the transition is smooth
[3:48:38] Speedglass: thank you for that
[3:48:42] TimsGamingDen: @vHaziel not really just ab it bigger and the icons are a bit further from each other
[3:48:45] BadPenguXD: i started a necro last night, shit is fuckin rad
[3:48:50] Terasleen: when is launch today? 1pm EST?
[3:48:55] Voluntaristgirl: cross save is awesome ... travel and play
[3:48:56] DeepSpaceK9: How far we've come from "dont you all have phones?"
[3:49:02] reflectthestorms: Crusader is S Tier in Diablo Immortal for sure, everyone is saying it's the best class in the game so far
[3:49:13] jimmyboyalbrecht: @Towelliee  can controller be used on the PC version ?
[3:49:26] TyleriumGaming: here is a phrase people have forgotten.. "you do you" Also mind your own business. Play the way you want
[3:49:29] Rockysteel: @jimmyboyalbrecht yes
[3:49:31] Voluntaristgirl: yes you can use controller on both
[3:49:35] BeardedKuhn: wish the necro had bit more melee focal point, but could be the whole point of the upcoming blood knight
[3:49:36] Moobot: TTG_B1G_TuNa, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:49:39] Brotana: It's a live game though so I would have to imagine they will be balancing often
[3:49:46] lilcutefawn: @Rockysteel Because the game is quite literally tailored around you paying for it. I mean I won't bother explaining this point because your comeback will be "then don't play it"
[3:49:49] Voluntaristgirl: if device allows it
[3:49:49] Speedglass: the fact you are versatile enough to stream mobile content is very nice of you
[3:50:15] Collected1: shrecked
[3:50:16] Speedglass: lets be real mobile has some of the best mmos
[3:50:19] smoketrayne: What time does pc version drop?
[3:50:25] Rockysteel: @haruchin nah i wouldn't say that, but you can enjoy the story, and level to 60 without paying anything
[3:50:26] Akira_Waifu: I will say, glad you're enjoying it Towel, between FF and WoW I have no time for anything else feelsbad lmao
[3:50:34] DeepSpaceK9: PC version at 10am PDT
[3:50:35] xseaka: @Speedglass LMAO waaaat
[3:50:48] pepefrogqt: if you dont plan to do pvp and do well you dont need to spend
[3:50:54] Gravespire: !server
[3:50:54] xHaziell: @vHaziel so we're gonna have those clunky icons like mobile?
[3:50:55] Moobot: @Gravespire Towelliee is playing on End of Days server for Diablo Immortal || New World Server US EAST - MAMMRAAAMA
[3:51:03] bobbydons: Yeah, it's really unfortunate that effective lobbying by the major corporations themselves has mischaracterized the microtransaction/mobile game  situation into an affront on a person's "personal choice." It's a classic method used throughout history to have people support a position that diametrically opposes their own interests (i.e., predatory gambling schemes that are obfuscated by attractive cosmetics and the idea of "choice.")
[3:51:11] MrGrimms: MrGrimms subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! It's Launch day!!!!
[3:51:13] xseaka: You also don't have a hope of competing on the PvE ladder...? Thats a huge part of Diablo
[3:51:15] mellzor: you can't really win in PvE, just complete it
[3:51:19] lonestar456: i just play pve
[3:51:21] BUHzar: LUL
[3:51:26] Speedglass: people are focused on the game not meeting their expectations they forget it takes a bit of effort to stream mobile games
[3:51:31] TimsGamingDen: Most care for leaderboards, and i guess those are in or not?
[3:51:39] WhSkY405: are you playing with a controller?
[3:51:39] rubberduckie0_0: but he gonna buy them gems LUL
[3:51:39] DeepSpaceK9: Not all of us do ladder/competitive play though. :O But I'll give them all my Google Rewards Credits.
[3:51:42] h_u_r_k_: @vHaziel its a mobile game that offers PC gameplay too, so yes you will get those icons.
[3:51:55] Moobot: ryanwcar, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:52:15] Lassoooo: is this the PC port?
[3:52:20] Speedglass: i dont want to discourage a streamer from streaming content because of how i feel about a game
[3:52:33] Naturalbeef: Thank goodness @bobbydons is here to determine what is and isn't good for us.
[3:52:34] Aevenath: how is he playing on PC? It's unavailable for me
[3:52:36] Jeffh934: what are the hilts used for? I haven't figured it out yet
[3:52:36] xHaziell: @vHaziel aaah i thought it was a pc versiom coming to mobile i see xd sorry i havent rly checked the game
[3:52:49] h_u_r_k_: @Aevenath this is mobile
[3:52:50] Innersane: @Towelliee is it true that endgame stuff is behind a paywall, that you cant get some of the items and gems without paying for it ?
[3:52:51] Jerrymonrock: Aevenath hes not
[3:53:02] xdarkwombatx: The game is free, people complain about $100 here and there. Its nuts. I have no issues spending $20 or $30 total if the game is good. @Towelliee
[3:53:05] MILESkg21: This is mobile for another 1 hour ish
[3:53:07] Voljere: make one
[3:53:07] lilcutefawn: Is the story of diablo immortal locked behind any sort of paywall? Or is it accessible to everyone normally
[3:53:07] Speedglass: its a pledge
[3:53:11] vavvor: make one take like 2 min
[3:53:14] shiny_flaaffy: is a warband a guild?
[3:53:14] sillymanfish: @towelliee you got a leg go chest that run
[3:53:15] Aevenath: ah the cursor looks smooth like a mouse lol, thanks

[3:54:03] Speedglass: i have a cat that hates human food to the point it avoids me when i eat
[3:54:04] Dalrend7640: hopefully battlenet doesn't tank
[3:54:04] sillymanfish: Yes

[3:56:36] Chiraakitteh: I saw there was already a warband called "The Hammer Squad" ... so I guess someone random made that?
[3:56:50] Speedglass: blizzard gave me diablo, starcraft and destiny all for free and when they wanted CoD to go F2P activision booted them out what a bad idea
[3:56:53] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee helliquary is raid. you need 420 gear score you won't be there for a while.
