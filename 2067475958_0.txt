[1:05:21] waitimdesyncd: Framesort isnt needed, you can get a macro target addon that always chooses dps or healers depending on what you put in macro, so you dont need Party1and 2 to align with roles

[1:06:15] FoxiekittenWoW: @iminent9 i understand, but binds are very individual. Make binds which makes sense for your own fingers and head. Whaazz is useing binds like ctrl-u and other weird binds that most people wont enjoy playing with.
[1:06:18] slickdaddyg69: whaazz has become a regulare schmuck
[1:06:18] Noli_HS: bro getting streamer treatment with these fast queues

[1:37:41] slickdaddyg69: Its so troll to play AWC without streaming = proceeds to play without streaming
[1:37:41] Schwenkyytv: to get people to know who you are
[1:37:59] magnusz: in a region like europe yea 100%
[1:37:59] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:38:01] tarifa123456: stream awc games
[1:38:01] magnusz: in NA no
[1:38:14] MaxMazonePrime: Why u dont stream it?
[1:38:16] crazydog64: Why arent you available for the Echo coaching service?
[1:38:18] magnusz: ohhh i wonder what pikas team is gonna play !!!
[1:38:21] magnusz: OHHHH IS IT GONNA BE RPS
[1:38:23] magnusz: OMGGGGGG
[1:38:32] graveheartxdxd: isnt in NA like better paid in sphere like streaming and stuff?
[1:38:35] magnusz: WOOOOOOOAH !!!!
[1:38:35] smuuchx: you can always do some stuff like no mic, people just like to watch how the games are going
[1:38:47] MarcusFanClub: what is ur take on addons in tournaments?
[1:38:49] Skyler33: RPS isn't viable, in EU SMOrc SMOrc
[1:38:49] boostgold7: How painful has sp been on a scale of 1-10?
[1:38:55] allport22: whos stopping you?
[1:39:15] slickdaddyg69: i was dissapointed u guys didnt stream ur games man u gotta do it for the echo fans
[1:39:17] magnusz: oh i mean bro u made more from the watch party than if u won the cup LOL
[1:39:26] Skyler33: every large stream just afk watches
[1:40:02] allport22: put it all in a pot and split 4 ways
[1:40:09] taylors09: why u kiilng that shark tho
[1:40:10] blackvpnv: ye
[1:40:10] shugguls: but u watch the streamer not the team
[1:40:10] blinkers89: so why dont u just split the money??ß
[1:40:16] Raikubest: makes sense
[1:40:25] harrison0192: ye
[1:40:28] slickdaddyg69: nah not true cuz if somebody beats u all the 2k veiwers go watch the guys who beat u
[1:40:28] cowboyyyy2025: yeah true
[1:40:37] shtain3r: every stream for himself i guess no?
[1:40:38] allport22: i guess you take subs out and it goes on ads rev and donos?
[1:40:38] Sokkee: then just split donations
[1:40:41] deucaly: how can we see stream of raiku if he never stream ahaha
[1:40:42] crazydog64: Make a new twitch just for the team?
[1:40:49] rdubm: the cup win is not guaranteed tho
[1:40:51] johnwelchhh: base pay for you being able to stream
[1:40:53] cowboyyyy2025: no cant split it
[1:40:59] Aldragonn: I feel like donations used to be way bigger
[1:41:04] stillfly: Just split ad revenue?
[1:41:04] Aldragonn: now its all gift subs instead
[1:41:09] magnusz: naw but could split ur ad revenue if thats ur take on it
[1:41:10] nsensex: stream on echo channel and split all
[1:41:11] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Whaazz and enter code: ECHO
[1:41:26] johnwelchhh: so say 500 bucks to each team mate in exchange for your =ability to stream
[1:41:31] magnusz: u could all 4 add ur ad revenues into a pile then divide it
[1:41:31] shtain3r: its good time to speak about amazon prime tho.
[1:41:36] Sokkee: if in Titel is Donations are split in our team
[1:41:44] Lord0Mirar: @nsensex and lose money to echo? Big Brain Kappa
[1:41:44] Moobot: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFHadK6prEPYQuCmR0tsug
[1:41:55] magnusz: depends how u want to do it
[1:41:55] MarcusFanClub: a team channel would be cool
[1:41:57] Toonahz: 33/33/33
[1:42:10] jaydogztv: just squad stream so the exposure is there
[1:42:10] ImZiimZ: then run 3min ads between games
[1:42:18] magnusz: like lets say hypothetically im on this @Toonahz guy team right and we all 4 stream
[1:42:21] atomic_gossipgirlxo: The money is a bonus
[1:42:21] magnusz: and we're a team and we're dogs
[1:42:26] jaydogztv: at that point the people will do what they want not every nba player makes the same
[1:42:26] magnusz: id just split that shit
[1:42:28] eacherro: Once money get involved... relationships get fucked up and destroyed 4ever... I rather not stream than fck up my friendship etc
[1:42:36] drakovics97: ok but then why don’t you have the same problem when you push ladder?
[1:42:38] allport22: @Raikubest how would you feel is whaazz made more on a stream than you during AWC? what would your thoughts be?
[1:42:40] cowboyyyy2025: yeah i agree i think its the high level gameplay
[1:42:47] echterdolens: its OP if u make Youtube Content out of the streamed AWC games
[1:42:48] Lord0Mirar: @magnusz You might end up "losing" money.. who would want that lmao
[1:42:48] boostgold7: grind for sure
[1:42:50] DiddyDemon: Anyone fill me in how the splitting convo came up?
[1:42:57] Toonahz: everyones gotta eat mag
[1:42:58] smuuchx: I agree, not everyone wants to see the rogue PoV, Im sure some of the people tune into lontar, raiku or chan as well.
[1:43:01] atomic_gossipgirlxo: And that's why you're investing in your SP gameplay, for our amusement.
[1:43:01] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:43:04] poroyou: *If you're good, if you're lucky
[1:43:08] magnusz: losing money momentarily for the growth of myself and my team
[1:43:11] magnusz: is just an investment
[1:43:17] magnusz: in my hypothetical
[1:43:17] poroyou: some of the best players in the world are sub 100 viewers
[1:43:23] eacherro: Once money gets involved... relationships get fucked up and destroyed 4ever... I rather not stream than fck up my friendship etc
[1:43:25] poroyou: You have to have personality for it
[1:43:34] xTilto: But there channel would also gain good viewership from the games aswell
[1:43:40] allport22: would probs help their channel grow... whats the price of that?
[1:43:43] aremyys: whazz do you have a link to your weakauras?
[1:43:46] velvlol: is playing video games for 16 hours a day for less than minimum wage really worth it
[1:43:50] willythenewb: a lot of apex pros stream their tourney games, maybe see what they're doing
[1:44:00] magnusz: think money only impacts ur friendships if u let it
[1:44:25] crucybletv: if your channel is the largest and you are all streaming and you play with them it’s still free advertisement of their channels
[1:44:37] magnusz: u would need a manager/3rd party to handle it for u guys
[1:44:38] Schwenkyytv: if your friends are mad at you for making money are they really your friends
[1:44:39] GRC_chris: who in the team cares so much about the money? isnt mehh not even really caring about money?
[1:44:40] kevvandh: yoooooooooo
[1:44:41] emmywiink: Couldn't you just use the Echo channel?
[1:44:41] smuuchx: I feel like all of you should stream, all of you would benefit in some way.
[1:44:43] jorg82: @magnusz depends on personality
[1:44:44] magnusz: to make it stress free
[1:44:45] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Whaazz
[1:44:45] Nextrkw: think its very grief
[1:44:47] Nextrkw: to not stream it tbh
[1:44:49] Raikubest: it is about money lets say mehh streams awc he gets 50 viewers, u stream awc u get 4000 viewers, mehh now recieved nothing and his chance of winning is now lower so he is losing money on it
[1:44:49] Nextrkw: in ur position
[1:45:00] ariest2225: how come warrior dh is popular in EU @whaazz
[1:45:17] allport22: @Raikubest would it not help the channel grow if you all promote each other?
[1:45:24] jeppehcs: I don't understand that argument tho?
[1:45:30] xTilto: I think you guys all pull really good viewership for wow anyway
[1:45:31] allport22: so long term its growth?
[1:45:32] DiddyDemon: Don't all of GG pika etc just stream solo
[1:45:33] jeppehcs: if you mute voice how is your chance of winning lower?
[1:45:43] Raikubest: so for mehh in this situation he lost alot of money
[1:45:46] xTilto: you would all get x3 the viewers if you streamed the games
[1:45:48] deucaly: squad
[1:45:49] AshvirTV: Squadstream
[1:45:52] TartanCass: Squadmode
[1:45:54] Sikaan: the stream together thingy yea
[1:45:56] slickdaddyg69: whaazz always talks about streaming tourney games but never does it sadge :(((
[1:45:57] GRC_chris: @Raikubest does he care though?
[1:45:58] Noli_HS: unpopular opinion. but one gets more viewer, thus more money, maybe he earned that since he built up a bigger community through streaming
[1:46:09] echterdolens: Mehh looses now even more because hes not even competing @Raikubest
[1:46:20] magnusz: u just get a 3rd party 5th person to handle it between all of u then its easy
[1:46:22] Raikubest: @grc_chris we all cared this was the thing why we didnt last year
[1:46:33] Abridbus: How is Tarren Milf right now as a server for PVP and for PVE ?
[1:46:40] Raikubest: this year me and lontar was down though
[1:46:48] Rewenzz: @Whaazz if you guys would want to earn money you could have a "team" channel on AWC nights where you all split the money from that exact channel tho
[1:46:56] xTilto: @Raikubest i swear you try it for one cup, all of you will benefit way more than if you dont
[1:46:56] slickdaddyg69: ECHO STREAM PLS FOR THE ECHO FANS <3
[1:46:59] Tjaktv: @Whaazz kunne det ikke også gøres igennem jeres sponsors twitch og dele det på den måde
[1:47:01] FoxiekittenWoW: @Raikubest what about this awc, i have heard you, lontar, chan and whaazz all say you are down to stream it?
[1:47:02] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @whaazz i swear bro blast 10+ hours everyday we gucci fak tourney Kappa
[1:47:02] willythenewb: TSM in apex legends, 1 player gets 20k+ viewers and the other teammates get like 2k viewers and they stream every tournament
[1:47:03] magnusz: mehh benefits in more ways than momentary money
[1:47:04] echterdolens: is Chan down? Chan is the only one who would make YouTube content out of it :D
[1:47:05] xTilto: if one person benefits slighlty more than the other then thats life
[1:47:06] magnusz: gets more exposure etc
[1:47:14] eacherro: @magnusz Yet it is the #1 divorce cause world wide...  Friendship is very similar to partner life in certain points, so there would definitely be some bitter taste...
[1:47:18] aremyys: i think not streaming it just makes no sense
[1:47:21] stillfly: Echo twitch channel could stream your games no? And split even from there?
[1:47:23] tarifa123456: stream the games for 0 money, just exposure
[1:47:25] Schwenkyytv: why is it your fault though that you can get more viewers compared to someone else
[1:47:26] allport22: @Raikubest then get it on!!!! i so wanna watch your POV
[1:47:28] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Problem with splitting ad rev on twitch is while you're on a team, not everyone streams the same amount. You'd need to log the overlapping hours and paying out then. otherwise, why should you contribute to a fund if you stream 13hrs and someone else only 1hr.
[1:47:29] echterdolens: This year the Hype is over.
[1:47:33] magnusz: yea i mean im not even gonna compare friendships to marriage
[1:47:40] magnusz: i aint never tried to put mini mag in my homies
[1:47:46] magnusz: u feel me
[1:47:51] Rewenzz: KEKW @magnusz
[1:47:52] bollskis: @magnusz lol
[1:47:58] Raikubest: yea wednesday is good
[1:48:17] echterdolens: i mean can u get a que pop or what
[1:48:17] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:48:21] Sikaan: should just start doing wednesdays and see how it goes
[1:48:26] allport22: surely it would be split only for the AWC times
[1:48:27] Raikubest: tbh wouldnt even mind to stream awc grand finals
[1:48:40] Raikubest: just need to cancel vpn over and over
[1:48:44] magnusz: well ur gonna restart ur stream right?
[1:48:49] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz
[1:48:51] slickdaddyg69: @Raikubest DO IT FOR THE ECHO FANS! <3
[1:48:52] magnusz: so the ad revenue will stop for that stream and then restart for the next stream
[1:48:52] allport22: @Raikubest your view count would be nuts - every mage haha
[1:48:55] Raikubest: so guess u gotta cancel stream over and over
[1:49:03] magnusz: i mean ur not gonna stream the entire time w/ delay on
[1:49:04] magnusz: thats feed
[1:49:06] blinkers89: idk... all the top players are somewhat popular for the audience that consumes wow pvp content but u 4(5 with mehh) are like celebrities or no? i feel like ur team is one of the teams that does profit 95% of the times
[1:49:07] eacherro: Not possible all 3-4 of you are streaming with their viewers? this way the "fans" will decide
[1:49:09] algebraist97: Mehh posted the final games on his YouTube, for anyone that wants the priest POV
[1:49:09] blinkers89: u just gotta try it
[1:49:26] DiddyDemon: Do you think streaming is enough to cost you wins with muted comms and hidden screen inbetween games?
[1:49:38] magnusz: well get more followers
[1:49:41] magnusz: LMFAO fuck it
[1:49:43] allport22: @Whaazz if its by day / by the hours you played - then the hours during awc you put in pot
[1:49:44] kelqoo: not full melee lobby POG
[1:49:50] KingBurn87: why is it unfair if ppl watch the streamer they want? lmao
[1:49:51] DiddyDemon: Sounds like communism
[1:49:55] DiddyDemon: lol
[1:49:57] Schwenkyytv: thats not your fault though that they dont have as many followers
[1:49:59] darkmyth1989: that’s the silliest reasoning I’ve ever heard. you don’t need to split anything. it’s exposure for their own brands lol. why would they not want to grow their own channels. if I create a shoe brand I’m not going to have the same exposure as adidas, but if I could team with them it would obviously help grow my brand off the back of theirs.
[1:49:59] xTilto: yeah is silly mindset
[1:50:01] magnusz: also, @Toonahz MORNIN
[1:50:02] xTilto: you will all grow as a result
[1:50:09] Frkntv: some things in life dont need to be fair, ofc whaazz has more viewers cuz he worked for it for years u cant compare to that a meh which streams 3 days a week max
[1:50:21] eacherro: Well, i wouldnt say so.. coz even you stream together, people can make "multi" stream and watch all 3-4 streams at once...
[1:50:23] rdubm: @darkmyth1989 facts
[1:50:25] xaviorn7575: hm i dont see why its unfair
[1:50:35] goldenpharmy: still below 2,1 ?
[1:50:39] Raikubest: its not silly ur chat is so troll mehh in my situation risks losing -60k usd for whaazz to grow his stream?
[1:50:44] Toonahz: MORNIN
[1:50:47] Raikubest: thats so troll to mehh
[1:50:54] Esotraz: Yes
[1:51:01] xaviorn7575: you promote your own twitch you shouldnt split if you have the views and someone else doesnt
[1:51:05] Raikubest: why would he agree?
[1:51:09] Raikubest: ofc he wouldnt
[1:51:12] kingmaxipoo: boomy games
[1:51:27] magnusz: bc then halme has a big swinging nutsack and thats worth more than any dollar amount
[1:51:32] magnusz: :usa:
[1:51:33] Aldragonn: that also assumes you are giving away things so important you go from winning the whole thing to like 4th or something
[1:51:36] Aldragonn: how likely is that?
[1:51:42] blinkers89: GIGACHAD
[1:51:42] Sorcharz: @Raikubest it grows mehh too doesn't it?
[1:51:57] xTilto: its not like one of you is going to get 100% of all the extra viewers
[1:51:57] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC
[1:52:15] phantomhunterxz: @goldenpharmy by this time he should already gave up and spare the viewers...
[1:52:20] Aldragonn: I think thats why cdew and pikaboo dont care that much because they just play the same shit anyways no surprises
[1:52:24] Stilflow95: <3
[1:52:31] slimjd33: @whaazz what is the pain icon in middle of the screen?
[1:52:32] DiddyDemon: Isn't there a way to stream games just mutted comms all the time and hidden screens in between games. We still get the POV just protect the competitve adv. Then all talk after
[1:52:45] umo3: Pretty sure Raiku's point is mehh doesn't stream enough for the "exposure" to mean anything so all he the streaming is doing is lowering their chance to win the tourny
[1:52:47] slickdaddyg69: @Aldragonn Pikaboo is a streamer hes not a pro player
[1:52:58] Aldragonn: @Aldragonn ????
[1:53:05] liqlevlinggod: Tbh show that u are the best and can win while streaming #legacy
[1:53:12] johnwelchhh: man dev is so fun except for z-axis on deep breath and such
[1:53:19] Aldragonn: bro is literally in tournaments getting paid thats definition of pro player lol
[1:53:19] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:53:32] tebak_: love your streaming <3
[1:53:37] diskmachin1: this convesrsation has already been had in RFW its not hard to understand?
[1:53:42] xHeeyo: just came here, can someone tell me context?
[1:53:53] eacherro: The best oucomes are: 1. All of you stream 2. none of you stream

[1:54:03] ripgodzx: tbh should just all do your own stream and people will switch between anyways if  its a group stream
[1:54:10] jaydogztv: i dont think you should have to give away what you have built for the time and effort you have
[1:54:25] deucaly: @jaydogztv agree
[1:54:38] xTilto: Yeah already gets aids when money is brought into the equation
[1:54:47] jaydogztv: you built your stream thats your earnings they are bad friends for wanting your earnings
[1:54:47] xTilto: content cucked because of money sadge
[1:54:56] jaydogztv: jaydogztv subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:55:34] allport22: Maybe you record all your games and then upload to your dead youtube? xD still see the PoV without losing the advantage xD
[1:55:35] jaydogztv: you think messi is giving away some of his salary
[1:55:42] jaydogztv: doesnt work that way
[1:55:54] allport22: @jaydogztv messi isnt streaming his games
[1:55:58] Elozern: can someone give quick summ of how this discussion came up?
[1:56:00] diskmachin1: @jaydogztv dogshit analogy tbh
[1:56:11] xiie_tv: sp gamer
[1:56:11] bollskis: @Elozern should echo stream awc games
[1:56:15] kelqoo: power of not full melee
[1:56:23] GRC_chris: when you play with messi all eyes are on you, if you do good you get offers from big teams and national team calls
[1:56:30] DoubleFreakTV: I mean ur playing shadowplay 4/6 games
[1:56:31] Elozern: @bollskis ok ty
[1:56:33] DoubleFreakTV: Giga insane
[1:56:45] tebak_: I don't follow you because you talk but because you play good, there is no need to speak during arena
[1:57:02] Elozern: @t3p4ck ? xdd
[1:57:02] skooovs: feeling better today?
[1:57:02] xiie_tv: dh > sp
[1:57:03] poroyou: You saw AWC melee cleaves just run over sp
[1:57:03] Robin_26: 1.9k mmr :S
[1:57:12] Skyle_win: 1.9 locks. thats why
[1:57:13] allport22: Maybe you record all your games and then upload to your dead youtube? xD still see the PoV without losing the advantage xD
[1:57:17] Elozern: @t3p4ck u trollin?
[1:57:18] fifathoto21: What is the WA in the middle which calls enemy cds?
[1:57:22] nemeuxs: hes marksmin
[1:57:23] Django_7: man talking big after winning rounds at 2k mmr
[1:57:27] Skyle_win: if it was 1.9 rogues, it would already suck more ^^
[1:57:31] Yeyolol: Yo, ur danish?
[1:57:36] nemeuxs: marksmanship its basically a caster
[1:57:41] Krozzyfix: @t3p4ck ?Xd
[1:57:49] Esotraz: cant interupt his casts so no
[1:57:52] actualreallifebillionaire: "sp so easy broken omega op" we were here yesterday brother
[1:57:53] Esotraz: mm is not a caster
[1:58:08] Krozzyfix: @t3p4ck words of a multichallenger pvper
[1:58:13] bollskis: tbh this sounds like a good problem to solve from a business perspective. automatically link teammates streams together and split ad revenue. if only twitch didnt lay of half its staff
[1:59:19] poroyou: that would work if they let you choose, subs, donos, ad rev toggle on and off
[1:59:19] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:59:21] actualreallifebillionaire: die
