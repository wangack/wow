[4:02:20] 0mark0v: Kind of @PsheroTV but they MAY have been refering to older sylers of heating and their draw backs. For example conventional oil electric heater coils reduce the humidity in small spaces such as living quarters relativley quickly. Opening your windows NOT ONLY may increase your average humidity inside but ALSO allow for more pleasent breathing conditions by rapidly cooling your lunngs... Gotta think brother... the more you know
[4:02:26] Lucons1: @0mark0v shh

[4:06:04] gdkpgold: and sweaty hairy men
[4:06:10] 0mark0v: @PsheroTV For the majority of the day i agree with you, but. If someone's been running a traditional heating source (presumably though the night) they can open their windows in the morning to allow the cool morning air (which although is likley colder and therefore maintians a lesser capasity for humidity) will relativley increase the humidity of their living space. Also, Sauna's Dry/Wet/indoor/outdoor ALL yes.

[6:10:09] celorion2: My inet is stable it never goes down
[6:10:18] struci: Chatting Overbooking is how airlines ensure that there are no available seats when a flight departs. So they sell more tickets in advance than there are seats on the plane. The point of all this is to ensure that the plane is full when it takes off, because empty seats are a financial burden for airlines.

[6:12:16] zanics: the pick the ugliest guy on the plane
[6:12:18] h5n12345: if it's not a charter flight, yes
[6:12:19] Bojanglez: they pay BIG for that
[6:12:20] dextroamphetaminePJSalt: sometimes they will offer vouchers
[6:12:24] tankata1: @PsheroTV You can sue them till the end of the world.
[6:12:24] struci: you get reimbursed for it usually
[6:12:27] xTrueEast: so what you're basically saying is no one can afford to travel so the seats are empty
[6:12:32] dextroamphetaminePJSalt: they will@offer you a gift card to not fly
[6:12:40] DanicksTV: "Is overbooking legal in Europe? Yes. The air carriers in the EU countries can overbook flights and trade more seats than they have available on the aircraft. If your flight is overbooked and you are denied boarding, you may ask for airline passenger compensation."
[6:12:46] Bojanglez: if they over book in the US, they HAVE to pay you like 3x the ticket cost or like 1500 minimum
[6:12:46] trmonx: you check in day before normally no, then you would encounter that not in airport
[6:12:51] struci: you might get upgraded to 1st class on another flight
[6:12:55] Mangobanana_: They usually put you on the next flight
[6:12:56] xaaaaa: GOTTEEM
[6:13:00] SailazarAY: savage
[6:13:00] dextroamphetaminePJSalt: i was offered 1500 USD once to not take a flight
[6:13:02] struci: KEKW maybe you're the one getting the seat then
[6:13:03] Bojanglez: deez nuts will be sitting in a chair with no flight lol
[6:13:07] zanics: me and my lawyers THIS
[6:13:10] Jdmqx: ALOO
[6:13:19] Kritheo: Sometimes they will book you a  flight on another airline.
[6:13:29] Bojanglez: they pay big bucks
[6:13:30] bbuckles: lol just go sit in airports
[6:13:33] weaknwither: i haven't flown in 20 years
[6:13:34] struci: they might be like: "okay both of your seats are overbooked. Who wants 1500$ to take the next flight?"
[6:13:36] tankata1: @dextroamphetaminePJSalt So you do not sue them
[6:13:37] struci: volunteers will be found
[6:13:39] thymos_: I'd take it
[6:13:52] Bojanglez: Ive not taken a flight for 1000 and only took me like 3hours extra
[6:13:54] lunkb3ck: yeah because they have data and most of the time it works out
[6:13:56] SailazarAY: wild
[6:14:12] zickiwow: nice earning @Bojanglez
[6:14:16] thymos_: it's a US thing
[6:14:16] zaz_D: i was denied a place on plane cause it was full and my luggage went with the plane cause it was a change from another plane...
[6:14:17] xTrueEast: its ''public'' transportion in my eyes so if my flight gets cancelled thats a first world problem imho not like my private plane is cancelling on me
[6:14:20] struci: the point is… if you no-show you don't get reimbursed for not actually taking the flight
[6:14:31] 0mark0v: Realistically your plans arent important to the logistical function of a 9 figure company.
[6:14:34] 7thSaga: 7thSaga watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! i a normie here <3
[6:14:39] GreyMoonz: never saw that happend personally
[6:15:03] 7thSaga: NotLikeThis planes
[6:15:06] lunkb3ck: their profit margins are super tight... they pretty much need to do that to keep tickets affordable
[6:15:07] struci: exactly
[6:15:08] 7thSaga: ill never fly
[6:15:10] bbuckles: Hey Pshero can you show your character sheet, interested what gear youre using. Also what do you recommend for pvp, build wise?
[6:15:21] thymos_: just ship them with the luggage
[6:15:22] struci: and if 201 people show, they reimburse one person… no issues
[6:15:28] Bojanglez: its not all doom and gloom. Airlines pay big bucks when it happens
[6:15:40] thymos_: open the chicken Pog
[6:15:40] zickiwow: im always last
[6:15:55] 0mark0v: You can get your ticket refunded if you dont make it. They'll often let you board a later flight if you're simply late.
[6:16:01] struci: I show last and board first peepoRich Kappa
[6:16:03] 7thSaga: sldo Hello Pshero and chat tasnPEACH
[6:16:16] 7thSaga: also''

[6:16:36] StreamElements: 📸 https://www.instagram.com/psherotv/ for Kote heroKOTE and IRL stuff.
[6:16:43] thymos_: maybe just let you on the next flight
[6:16:47] gebrselassie: you have to show up 2 hrs early in us cause of tsa
[6:16:47] struci: and usually you only get a refund if you're late because of a previous flight
[6:17:07] Lurax07: low cost companies dont reimburse nothing :)

[6:18:15] Istunlocklocalpensioners: lol
[6:18:27] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Ryanair are a meme, but they do the job
[6:18:43] 0mark0v: I believe it. Technically it was a more dangerous trip.
[6:18:51] zickiwow: KEKW
[6:18:52] pocket_goose: KEKW 󠀀

[6:19:42] mantis__toboggan__: Corpa nice
[6:19:43] pocket_goose: what?
[6:19:49] pocket_goose: KEKW
[6:19:50] zickiwow: train should be free
[6:19:55] Istunlocklocalpensioners: airlines make their money on volume
[6:20:01] setupsqt: hello!
[6:20:01] struci: and then they had to pay a taxi to the airport and the whole calculation was ruined

[6:20:25] 0mark0v: Nothing is free. What do you mean? @zickiwow
[6:20:26] nullvektorx: and then you're f'ed because the return flight is suddenly much more expensive.
[6:20:35] Istunlocklocalpensioners: yeah it is odd
[6:20:39] zickiwow: yeye u know what i mean @0mark0v
[6:20:39] fettlink: most people are afraid to fly
[6:20:41] Istunlocklocalpensioners: maybe they just overprice that shit
[6:20:43] struci: Germany has the "Deutschlandticket" now YEP flatrate for 49€/month
[6:20:43] Lurax07: ofc thats depending the period that they bought the tickets and all of that
[6:20:50] 0mark0v: @thymos_ cheapest how?
[6:20:56] zickiwow: 49€/month is ok#
[6:20:58] xTrueEast: salaries?
[6:20:59] xitera: becouse in Bulgaria goverment own the trains but in england are privates
[6:21:05] 0mark0v: Per pound, but not perfect.
[6:21:05] Byshash: maybe railway maintenance is expensive

[6:23:08] zickiwow: why?
[6:23:09] 0mark0v: Trains are super cool. They're incredibly efficient as a solution to bulk travel and transport... but they're fucking enormous. Have you ever seen the size of a SINGLE train wheel? Do you think you could lift ONE above you head?
[6:23:23] xitera: in UK is private and the companies do whatever they want
[6:23:27] paganlzer: still have those which remember lenin?
