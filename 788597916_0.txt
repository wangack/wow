[0:48:04] shamp_z: and im done
[0:48:10] MetallicusGaming: hotspurs1695 simple, it's to give ppl enough time to enter chat (he also preparer etc) no point in starting the conversation with 100viewers when he can give ppl time to enter and start the convo with 700+ ppl

[3:11:52] PvtHudson093: hes going to do lots and lots of cocaine
[3:11:53] keeindordel: @Bh_beast not true the downtime is the server discconnects the lag and the fact SOME ppl get to travel to the new zones while other ppl cant get the quest to work
[3:11:54] kiwi_meow: !TWITCH
[3:11:56] Thunderbrew: @Towelliee Is DCarter and Terry helping with the Marathon. There were questions as to whether they would be able to help.

[3:13:41] Moskeebee: mmmm bitters and soda hangover cure
[3:13:48] rev05: Skrewball with hot chocolate is like a nice warm reeses on a cold day
[3:13:55] MrGattz: @SirTano do you have an adblock enabled?

[3:15:18] Zettabyte: out of control @Towelliee towLul
[3:15:19] rev05: It's because Twitch is waging a war against adblockers
[3:15:23] Malkyr: WTF I have run this dungeon thousands of times and never noticed the eyes in the floor tile
[3:15:30] timslayz: lol take off your ad block is the solution
[3:15:38] Khlaro: If you guys are leveling anything, make sure to get your bonfire buff before the halloween event ends. You can stack it with the DMF buff
[3:15:43] BubbaLuvva: I’m always surprised that people get pissed at ads, remember what tv was like?
[3:15:47] sMoKiE_1: since I joined 90 minutes ago, ublock reported that it has already blocked 61 ads
[3:15:49] warlorddraks: stream raiders ready
[3:15:53] sMoKiE_1: thats a crazy amount
[3:15:53] Thunderbrew: Towelliee pretty much pulls the same amount of viewers each day.
[3:15:58] 91Niki: My adblock is fine, worth the 4.99 a month SeemsGood Kappa
[3:16:02] MrGattz: it is the solution..
[3:16:02] Hoothers: @Towelliee Twitch is being sued by the European commission, they are working on the allegations now , it is related with child abuse from what i have heard
[3:16:04] Scattered112: stream radiers time
[3:16:06] MrGattz: thats actually a thign
[3:16:10] rev05: Twitch releases a new way to get around adblocks, adblockers within a few hours release a way to circumvent it again
[3:16:11] GoobageBag: Good morning towelliee, Almost 10 years watching you man. Love to see your success
[3:16:16] Midnitespin: but i am blockin LUL

[3:16:20] DavidBrutal123: i have adblock and i get 0 adds
[3:16:20] zenholmer: i use the twitch app and i don't get ads its really strange
[3:16:21] liam0199: liam0199 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:16:23] SilkeySmooth: they would still run more ads..lol
[3:16:25] Pharaoh_326: i dont have ad block and i get 6-8 ads everytime
[3:16:26] MrGattz: you need to turn your ad blockers off for twitch ads to run properly
[3:16:27] its_andyd: towelliee be buggin
[3:16:28] SirTano: On this phone no, so I saw the ads. On my comp yesterday I have Adblock, and then just got a purple screen that said something like ads are running @mrgatz
[3:16:30] Wulfgrym: im removing twitch before ad block
[3:16:35] Craftzwerg: @91Niki you mean 4.99 times 30 for the streamers i watch regularly ? :)
[3:16:38] dym_jt: I don't get ads with uBlock Origin, haven't used the actual "AdBlock" extension i years.
[3:16:40] ShadoodHD: imagine ads not working even with adblock on KEKW
[3:16:42] dengueuk: @Towelliee whats this new contract i keep seeing in chat?
[3:16:52] 91Niki: @Craftzwerg Then just sub to Twitch Turbo ? LUL
[3:16:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[3:16:55] Lilyofthemyst: Im on mobile and had 7 ads in a row 10min ago
[3:17:00] rev05: It's time for a new streaming site anyways LUL
[3:17:08] Moobot: Thanks for subbing for 7 months, @LIAM0199 towHAMUP
[3:17:09] Spaede: its 2020, literally everything is commercialized, why are consumers still suprised to see ads lol
[3:17:11] 91Niki: @Craftzwerg Twitch Turbo is 8.99, and you won't see ads on twitch
[3:17:13] Thunderbrew: I turned off my Adblocker. I'll see if it changes the Twitch ad behavior.
[3:17:16] MrGattz: if you have an ad blocker on then it blocks the timer that tells twitch when to show you an ad which gives you more ads then normal
[3:17:18] Aquadriel: It was over when they posted that tweet, it came back two weeks ago
[3:17:24] nurpdwise: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 my man @towelliee!!!! hows it hangin brother!??

[3:17:42] Hoothers: UBlock and OriginBlock seems to do the job for me atm
[3:17:44] Tidus99: To be honest if i go to a stream and i cat adds i usually just exit out and find another streamer to watch
[3:17:46] TheStank1990: whats been your favorite exp to level in so far?
[3:17:50] Krelborn: Atleast its just 15-30sec of silence instead of some annoying and loud commercial
[3:17:56] Craftzwerg: @91Niki so creating a problem and then offer a solution is fine to you ?
[3:17:56] Laffitaffi11: Anyone try. The anniversary event? How’s the exp?
[3:17:56] thatquidproquo: ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1 ShowLove1
[3:18:01] FerociouzMonk: just update adblock lol. they have started blocking ads again.
[3:18:01] timslayz: F
[3:18:02] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee i have been watching for about 15 minutes... i saw the opening ad, and then i have seen one since. i do not use an ad blocker.
[3:18:04] fistofnature: how do you get turbo?
[3:18:05] ShadoodHD: i thought turbo works together with prime 🤔
[3:18:09] TheRiwen: welcome to adds
[3:18:09] B3KA: i see prerolls all the tim,e
[3:18:12] 91Niki: @Craftzwerg Bruh, twitch turbo has been a thing since forever LUL
[3:18:15] MadfoolGaming: @Laffitaffi11 +16% the exp bonus is
[3:18:16] LPC_Sparc: I don't know *anyone* that actually likes ads
[3:18:19] SpyCrabbo: turbo isn't working correctly at the moment, they tweeted about it
[3:18:29] Thunderbrew: Part of the contract is playing more ads?
[3:18:34] NexusOps: @ShadoodHD prime users used to get no ads like Turbo subs. Not anymore. Twitch removed that from Prime subs
[3:18:34] ShadoodHD: well shit brb ima buy turbo then
[3:18:35] LPC_Sparc: but imagine how much cheaper products could be if these companies didn't blow money on advertising >.>
[3:18:43] lucid_lucius: u missed quest npc?
[3:18:43] Malkyr: The preroll has definitely stopped me from checking out smaller creators when I just want to pop in and check out the channel real quick. I wonly really wait for a creator I already know now. :(
[3:18:46] Crendall: Turbo is worth every cent IMO
[3:18:49] Aquadriel: @Towelliee so if you have your adds cause of your contract, do we get those AND midrolls? or only one kind?
[3:18:54] Craftzwerg: 91Niki yeah i dont have problem seeing adds on twitch in content breaks but over the past couple of days the random addbreaks have been just ridiculous
[3:18:59] 0Not: turbo helps a lot, but it shouldn't be necessary
[3:19:04] LPC_Sparc: like me, I've got my mind made up on things I do/don't want - an ad isn't going to sway me either way
[3:19:06] aimassistallen: monks tank good chat? it feels fun
[3:19:14] TheRiwen: i never see adds and if i see one i forget it 1 sec later
[3:19:17] its_andyd: charities XD
[3:19:18] RocketMan23: i mean advertising works, otherwise these companies wouldnt spend money on it
[3:19:20] LPC_Sparc: word of mouth is MUCH more effective - at least toward people like me
[3:19:21] Thunderbrew: Buy off brand products that don't advertise so much. Cheaper.
[3:19:31] timslayz: I think they could find a less intrusive way to play the ads such as playing them over chat.
[3:19:36] Doublezoh: who?
[3:19:37] FrozenBroo: "Who?"
[3:19:37] Craftzwerg: wildstar FeelsBadMan

[3:19:56] LPC_Sparc: lol
[3:19:58] Drakonus: Wildstar the one i missed - thank god
[3:20:00] Froggertplox: The midroll thing is just poor thinking on twitches part. Imagine WoW World First race getting an ad as the kill occurs or something like that, just not well thought out.
[3:20:00] 0Not: FeelsBadMan cvHazmat
[3:20:02] Arcaste_: F wildstar FeelsBadMan

[3:20:07] MarquisLek: didn't they get felicia day to play their game or some shit
[3:20:07] Thunderbrew: @Towelliee Did Wildstar die because of not enough players?
[3:20:08] Grunton: i loved the game just end game was to painful to get into
[3:20:08] 91Niki: @Craftzwerg Yeah i get that. But just gotta be patient, pay for twitch turbo, or get into the adblock coding industry, complaining does nothing :P
[3:20:09] Xedeffen: That was a good game too :(
[3:20:10] Craftzwerg: i lov3ed wildstar FeelsBadMan
[3:20:12] Bogzeh: twitch sponsorships werent rly a thing back then i think?
[3:20:12] Ohdies: I loved wildstar
[3:20:14] ShadoodHD: "word of mouth will make it famous"... didnt work FeelsBadMan
[3:20:15] th30dor: gameplay wasnt that great either.. so I guess?
[3:20:18] facerolljack: That would probably work for a game like WoW but for a new game advertising is everything
[3:20:21] SadDingus: spending on ads is fine, if your game is crap, the ads wont matter
[3:20:27] soundpraenk: wildstar was ok but its performance issues killed it for me, it was horrible and they didn't do anything about it
[3:20:33] Moskeebee: i will leave the channel if i join and i immediately see and ad..I'll come back but im more apt to hang around and deal with an ad if its not right when i wanna join the stream lol
[3:20:34] PToastman: im sorry, I trust towelliee on that one lol
[3:20:37] SirTano: The ads i just got came with a counter that said “x/8,” with x ticking up with every ad. That and not having Adblock on this phone makes me think it’s Twitch intentionally dropping a block off 8 ads at a time, and I just happened to get two of those blocks back to back. Whatevs. But thanks for trying to help @mrgattz ! :)
[3:20:49] Drakonus: Rift was cool on release enjoyed that
[3:21:01] Craftzwerg: @91Niki well the situation does something ... it drives me to other forms of entertainment ... which isnt addflooded yet ;)
[3:21:03] SubQ: many have tried...
[3:21:03] PToastman: Rift didnt have any personality
[3:21:07] Meshindale: i like watching you @Towelliee I learn a lot of new things about gaming news and happening. Congrats on your Partnership
[3:21:12] Malkyr: It works both ways though, I found your channel when SwtoR launched so taking their sponsopships grew your stream too
[3:21:17] Apheelia: When I level new characters for shadowlands is there any reason to play through bfa campaign? Is it something I have to do?
[3:21:18] ShockASU: "You're not in Azeroth anymore...." towLul
[3:21:20] Scattered112: rift public events were so fun!
[3:21:25] othraerir: it died with nightmare tide
[3:21:26] 91Niki: @Craftzwerg You do you. Still complaining in chat does nothing :P
[3:21:28] th30dor: but greed. Man, i loved Rift. Best tank and healing classes I ever so
[3:21:28] PToastman: it was quality stuff but it lacked a real aesthetic
[3:21:35] dym_jt: 99% of twitch chat has no clue how business works or how to run a company.
[3:21:36] tr4ncetv: they stopped caring about RIFT and moved them to Defiance/ArcheAge/Glyph platform
[3:21:37] othraerir: having to pay for necklace slot
[3:21:41] FrozenBroo: Stonks
[3:21:48] iceproxx: thats the direction wow is heading now LUL
[3:21:49] othraerir: wait, earrings or whatever
[3:21:54] Otschboh: 3Head
[3:22:00] 91Niki: @Craftzwerg Also like people have been saying in chat. Using adblock atm gives you MORE ads. So try disabling it
[3:22:00] Craetos_: that is one of the most sad things I´ve heard :( :D
[3:22:02] nielefs: Hope that never happends
[3:22:09] Ohdies: @towelliee have you followed the dev of corepunk? I find it has wildstar flavour..
[3:22:18] Queenjii: Pay to not play the game. Genius!

[5:05:04] szeeman62: @Towelliee So since you're a bigger partner now does that mean you'll be spending more time on your onlyfans page?
[5:05:05] TettixHD: agreed
[5:05:05] PotbellyGoat: yeah, I'll get this cleared up on my laptop
[5:05:11] MrGattz: @Pepega_in_the_chat_ nope. ad blockers actually make ads worse now.
[5:05:12] Thunderbrew: Random Commercials during a stream sucks.
[5:05:19] Dreeeewster: Yeah one big, then go do something else get a drink or go to bathroom etc ^^
[5:05:22] phen04: hell yeah. let's you get up and get a drink or go to the bathroom. just better that way
[5:05:24] DrakeDuude: @Towelliee ty for the heads up on the ads. i greatly appreciate that
[5:05:24] Hippogriffin: thats true, i hate it when youtube interrupts my video midway with ads
[5:05:25] theDirtyon3: @Thunderbrew have you ever watched tv?
[5:05:26] JLmorten: Do you have any advantages of Tier3 subs over tier1 subs ??
[5:05:29] TheHardcorian: Twitch is becoming a TV like network instead of a streaming platform...kinda scary
[5:05:30] Pepega_in_the_chat_: @MrGattz how can this be any worse?
[5:05:31] PineappleBoB06: Should be taking a break every hour anyway
[5:05:31] AureliusXV: how? i dont see them

[5:05:36] itsPavYy: Long time lurker just wanted to say a Huge congrats @Towelliee for the GFuel sponsorship and getting that twitch deal, been watching you since the JTV days
[5:05:45] Epiclawlzable: should we unsub so we can watch ads then?
[5:05:50] tibbus1730: Totally agree, and it makes the ads more impactful when we're not bombarded with them every minute
[5:05:55] Tyrandian: I'll try GFuel when you get your own flavor.
[5:05:57] BioHazmatt: BioHazmatt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! woo grats with all the good things going on atm dude towHAMUP

[5:05:57] MrGattz: if you have an ad blocker enabled then it blocks twitch from seeing how many ads you are getting and then sends you more ads every 15 mins @Pepega_in_the_chat_
[5:06:02] bollespacing: mcgibbsy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Kappa

[5:06:13] theDirtyon3: @MrGattz LUL shh dont tell em
[5:06:16] Charbeans: I've turned off my addblocker for twitch and it's gotten better
[5:06:22] Untalented83: I 100% dont agree with ads for live content, if its at the beginning thats fine. but during live content is stupid because you miss things, takes away from the stream
[5:06:22] Dragoncaller: Dragoncaller subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! late boo!
[5:06:23] Moobot: Thanks @DRAGONCALLER for subbing for 4 months! towHAMUP
[5:06:27] Pepega_in_the_chat_: No no no I want ADD blocker to kill the adds. not give me more
[5:06:30] MrGattz: yes turn your adblockers off to not get as many ads on twitch
[5:06:35] messinna: oh whell i wish i knew that il grinded all week :D
[5:06:39] Thunderbrew: @theDirtyon3 Network Television Commercials aren't random, the program stops, the commercials play, then the program starts up again. Random Commercials in Streams interrupts the streamer.
[5:06:39] messinna: thx Gatz ..

[5:06:49] Beefloaf: I wish Twitch would do muted ads, so we can still hear the streamer when one goes on, or switch the add to the small window above chat.
[5:06:50] MrGattz: !wa @BulletBHD
[5:06:50] Moobot: we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at https://wago.io/search/luxthos || For the green leveling exp WA, you can find that our !discord under the #ui-and-wa-info channel!

[5:30:55] cazhually: @MrGattz that's fantastic. Towelliee defintiely deserves
[5:30:58] Kisswani: Kisswani gifted a Tier 1 sub to nomad_91! They have given 115 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[5:31:02] MetallicusGaming: So after 10 years I can finally stop worrying about Towelliee? HYPE I can get some sleep LUL
[5:31:06] Jardon00: @Shurn_82 and my statement wasn't directed at you, someone else said something about Twitch being the problem

[5:31:58] Shurn_82: @Jardon00 not really, they should be letting people know where and what clip / vod it was in. Its very unprofessional to reprimand and not explain or give example to it. I dont take it personal ;) I like to think outside of the confines of the norm
[5:32:00] Kisswani: <3

[5:32:46] Jardon00: @Shurn_82 I don't think they can really, the RIAA has told them that there is copyright stuff and to remove it, I don't think they are really allowed to vocalize it, I could be wrong though

[5:33:47] Shurn_82: @Jardon00 they sure can, Youtube and other platforms send you a clip link to it, so you can learn from it. Twitch tends to do a lot of stupid shit without thinking ...

[5:34:43] Kisswani: Dragon fruit fucker ?
[5:34:43] Jardon00: @Shurn_82 I mean, that may be true, but that doesn't mean Twitch's systems work the same. I mean, don't get me wrong, DMCA shit is stupid and they need to get with the times, but in the end, it's not Twitch's fault like so many people think
[5:34:47] Shurn_82: @Jardon00 I like how you think btw! its nice to have a chat with someone capable of thinking

[5:36:54] au_ne: not healthy
[5:36:54] Shurn_82: @Jardon00 the issue is actually not just twitch, but the RIAA ... their board of directors is full of people from the music industry that has been known to bleed its artists for money! They actually hav a lot of immoral contracts with artists
[5:36:55] heltvild: powder is nice and convinient not needing to buy so many cans

[6:14:06] Sonatta: i don't think Naxx is going to be a one day thing for a lot of guilds

[6:15:07] MackAttack1421: Isn't that why they put Naxx in Wrath?
[6:15:07] jj_ptv: they gave up on classic I'm sure. or at least they would love to be done with it.
[6:15:07] MrGattz: astral cloud serpent isnt actually that hard to get, its a 4% drop chance
[6:15:10] SpiteNL: OG TBC was even announced before Naxx was and killed all the hype for Naxx
[6:15:11] thickthighs91: @Towelliee prolly 2 weeks later BC OUT!
[6:15:13] Evoca85: BC will release in May, during Shadowlands dead zone
[6:15:13] scoringnormal: that is the true classic experience
[6:15:17] swordart_19: Can anyone tell me if GFUL goes to EU <
[6:15:22] MysticalOS: Maybe that's the point.. maybe they want to keep naxx particpation low, beacuse classic is going to be whole trilogy, which means naxx again in wrath

[6:15:46] propoopimus: @swordart_19 thx for confirming KEKW
[6:15:48] splic3r0: I'm still suprised why Naxx is going to be a 1 day clear when originally it was like an only 1% thing
[6:15:49] matt2d2007: tbc should be it's own thing.
[6:16:01] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee You are right, but people dont have anything to do in Classic anyway, and Naxx will not change that
[6:16:01] swordart_19: @damage_patrol you are welcome
[6:16:03] acearinos: killing the naxx hype is the vanilla experience though 4Head

[6:16:31] Stringerrs: How long will your shadowlands marathon be?
[6:16:33] lanara233: How many players will actually run naxx?

[6:16:35] Gian_Cena: yeah cuz asmongold gonna be playin
[6:16:38] swordart_19: CLASSIC OMEGALUL i watched Sodapopping project 30 naxx that was something fun to watch
[6:16:38] Aidler: well "no changes" towLul
[6:16:39] realJohnKimble: @splic3r0 why 1% only cleared it, is due the fact that it was release with so close to TBC launch.
[6:16:43] ormy86: they can just do Naxx when Classic WotLK comes out in another year and a half

[6:38:05] Gibsonex937: Sargeras was awful I just waited lol
[6:38:07] MysticalOS: they let people who were already on play but didn't let players login
[6:38:12] ormy86: so since they have now decided to have a Monday launch are they throwing in the Tuesday reset as a set break so that no one dies b/c they were playing too long?
[6:38:15] jackvalentin: when is pre-patch event starting ?

[7:57:29] MemezTV: The Alliance have nothing else to invest in XD
[7:57:45] azzurrin: Probably less Alliance chairs so they have to make em
[7:57:51] biscuitness: @Biggs_o7 yeah - the Razer Iskur seems to be very similar to the Secret Labs, which is great. Excited to get it this week.

[7:59:48] 0ldnslow: My Secret Labs took a really long time to break in. Had to give it to my Dautgher
[7:59:50] skylerNsadie: 50 is the max lvl till SL comes out
[7:59:53] mikejames01: a chair over 200 is dumb
[7:59:57] RavenARPG: herman miller are totally worth it
[8:00:00] afkpoopn: If I bought one of those my wife would make me sleep in it
[8:00:00] biscuitness: Herman Miller becomes less useful when you're fairly tall. Why I went with a nice gaming chair since they are better ergonomics for the upper height range depending on the chair.
[8:00:02] funKShun: Herman Miller Embody is like 1.5k
[8:00:06] Skylin3r: what about noblechairs?
[8:00:16] Fitty204: Spending good money on a chair is totally worth it if you game 6+ hours a day.
[8:00:21] azzurrin: Buying a herman miller embody next month for my new place
[8:00:29] funKShun: @mikejames01 dumb if you don't sit at your pc for 10 hours for day
[8:00:37] Maruika: what herman miller chair do you have tow
[8:00:39] biscuitness: I really wanted the HM Embody, but just not worth the money being pretty tall. The upper back support isn't there.
[8:00:51] Xsidious: Which Herman Miller chair do you have?
[8:00:53] funKShun: @Maruika Embody

[8:01:47] biscuitness: Yeah, the Embody is a great chair for a fairly wide range of bodies, but the upper limits less so. The logitech one is pretty cool (Lula has that one, right?)

[8:02:53] papaPathos: properly maintained, these chairs last a good while longer than chairs for 50 bucks, tho
[8:02:59] biscuitness: The Razer Iskur was like $500. But along the same lines as SL Titan.
[8:03:09] funKShun: Moobot is sneaky bastard LULW
[8:03:10] afkpoopn: I just F5'd, it got rid of the ads

[8:03:53] ZyntosAran: @TrieCC the anniversary buff is xp
[8:04:13] nothumbgamer_ttv: @TrieCC not on my tooltip o.0 experience and reputation gains increased by 16%
[8:04:22] MrGattz: the buff is a 15% exp and 15% rep bonus with a 16% exp gain on mob kills
[8:04:22] zigzugg: is dmf up this week?
[8:04:28] Thunderbrew: If you are on the Carousel, it won't let you into a dungeon either.

[8:07:08] PoppaShot: i just got 9 adds @Towelliee
[8:07:09] y0rtek: the thing is, twitch is also blaming ANY 3rd party extensions you use for twitch.

[8:10:14] MrGattz: @Arazu_ so whats been going around on reddit is that if you have ublock there is a custom code that you can put in to block ads. twitch found a way around that custom code and now it blocks the timer that is used to control how many ads you see per hour. so basically everyone that still has ublock is being screwed over.
