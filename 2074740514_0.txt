[0:33:26] junkilolzaa: @NutterCircus seen a mage 1 pull 45secs drinking
[0:33:50] ragnof_: with cars you only get 2 of these 3: Fast, Reliable, Cheap.
[0:33:57] Zolacee: why brz over gr86 and frs
[0:33:59] NutterCircus: @junkilolzaa Mage mana sucks, but at least you can pull a pack of 10 which would take longer one by one.
[0:34:00] Pixiepantss: NotLikeThis
[0:34:00] boomjahha: lol

[0:35:22] PayGorn95: priest
[0:35:23] ragnof_: wrx 22b is dope gotta love subarus
[0:35:29] NutterCircus: @junkilolzaa If you notice, it normally takes 40% mana just buffing yourself as a mage. It is a bit ridiculous.
[0:35:31] Laxxean: i love my warrior lol
[0:35:35] senpai69x: warrior feels awful without a priest and wf
[0:35:35] codyfeast: how you feel about feral
[0:35:37] st0neh: I got my hunter geared out the ass, now I'm leveling a rogue .lol
[0:35:40] kallebalik: left my warrior for my priest :=)
[0:35:40] Winttyrr: yeah, nah, this aint our phase
[0:35:44] Toyotooo: Lets hope P2 doesnt last as long as P1. A lot of people are already raid logging
[0:35:45] ilovestarfire777: warrior at 60 will be like bis wf warr with sm in wotlk , i bet
[0:35:46] wikla: i main warrior and i really do enjoy MTing but other than that its kinda meh
[0:35:47] junkilolzaa: @NutterCircus 100% if u die in wsg u buff ur at 60% lmao

[0:35:52] makatoottv: i still like warr but im just dw tanking and its fun lol
[0:35:55] Timzn91: @SONII i play warrior since 2005 and it feels so bad in SOD its so disapointing
[0:36:01] sovngardener: i was never particularly fond of pvp so no big change in getting fucked up by most classes, but i love being able to play arms and do serious dmg
[0:36:02] B_Rize: The 80 rage meta felt so bad lol
[0:36:07] randypotter44: SONII YOUR AIRCUT ROCK !!!
[0:36:07] straff_dis: only two good runes we got that were impactful and fun were smf and wb...
[0:36:11] The_Crane: If I see a warrior on pvp I'm like "ooh free kill"
[0:36:33] rawlexdota: The thing is, i got asked what rune would i miss from sod when i go back to classic, asnwer, pretty much none, that kinda says alot xD
[0:36:35] Zanketsuk3n: which tweet so i can like it
[0:36:36] Billyonairetv: We need spell reflect and stuff like that, something to play around the dmg, a book for shieldwall etc to be 3min cd or something. Not rallying cry x)
[0:36:42] Winttyrr: theyre so scared to buff warrior lol. even jus with utility
[0:36:46] ragnof_: Season of Donttalkaboutwarriors
[0:36:54] csant1023: its cuz you use tmorph. =P
[0:37:06] st0neh: I think it's a crime warriors didn't get bladestorm
[0:37:08] skizzington: pvp just doesn't seem fun at all unless you're playing priest or boomkin
[0:37:14] slat_ppc: Imorph? payoOld
[0:37:14] Winttyrr: fuckin melee hunter dominating every field with one button buit warriors can barely quest without stopping to eat every other mob rn
[0:37:16] Ballprint: your hair changed
[0:37:16] omidiart: @SONII damn I've never seen you die so much lol
[0:37:19] NutterCircus: Even a 3 min cd heal would be nice.
[0:37:20] Ballprint: u look younger
[0:37:24] B_Rize: When they announced SOD at Blizzcon they literally had a slide for warriors hinting that we would be nerfed
[0:37:29] junkilolzaa: i get imorph but whats the command to get rank 14 gear
[0:37:34] slat_ppc: Never heard of such a thing payoS
[0:37:37] st0neh: With warrior in literally the same state as it is currently at least with bladestorm it'd be fun every couple minutes KEKW
[0:37:42] rawlexdota: What rune would u miss if u get back to era right now ?
[0:37:49] sand_pump: axe drop yet?
[0:37:51] omidiart: @SONII my bad, you're invincinble in my mind lol for real.

[0:38:31] Winttyrr: that fuckin drain life link effect
[0:38:34] Naddah: soul link meta locks arent bad
[0:38:36] ragnof_: @deltrexx you played sod yet?
[0:38:36] ilovestarfire777: warrior in the meantime: here is a white hit.
[0:38:36] makatoottv: my biggest compliant with warriors isnt even the numbers it just the vibes and the runes are so lame and boring lol idk
[0:38:37] DrSmudgyKing: as a rogue main i feel your pain about the warrior stuff
[0:38:41] papa_squat123: i got crit for 3k chaos bolt last night. locks are fiiiine
[0:38:42] junkilolzaa: atleast wars can fight mages with extra combat charges
[0:38:46] AxB_lol: whats up sonii
[0:38:47] DrSmudgyKing: i cant even get in gnomer as a rogue lmao
[0:39:00] ragnof_: @junkilolzaa bro i main mage, warrs cannot do shit rn lol
[0:39:01] NutterCircus: How often do you stance dance sonii?
[0:39:01] quttersraga: cldnt it be just like it classic that wars is pretty trash untill they hitt lvl 60 where they scale endlessly
[0:39:03] Selecktt: Whats good
[0:39:06] yarrpeter: Maybe they aren't responding because they're cooking something up
[0:39:07] AC1DNUK3: LUL  that was my attempt at getting attention to it, get asmon to watch it too lmao
[0:39:11] junkilolzaa: rogues are 99% raid leaders
[0:39:19] Turkeypitz: season 4 bro - you'll be like hold my beer
[0:39:20] sand_pump: level ya priest and main it xDD
[0:39:23] st0neh: Sounds like copium and very well may be @SONII but what if Blizzard is sandbagging warrior because they know it'll melt at 60, right? ... ...right? PepeHands
[0:39:26] hivemindqt: u cant go to gnomer as melee unless u are hunter
[0:39:27] Grim059: warrior has been the best wow classic class forever. they are shaking it up welcome to the bottom tier lol
[0:39:38] Zolacee: so whenever theres a niche scenario
[0:39:39] TheTrueShayde: just tell Asmon to tweet blizz
[0:39:54] xraypandaa: New twist on warriors: They are bad
[0:39:55] omidiart: this is the season of discovery?
[0:40:03] kigami_uro: only thing warriors got was warbringer
[0:40:03] NutterCircus: Phase 1 Wariors were pretty cracked.
[0:40:08] AxB_lol: yeah this isn't suppose to be the sweaty version of wow, it's suppose to be a fun for sure
[0:40:11] Selecktt: Cheer100 I rolled an enhancement shaman. It is INSANE how much more fun the class is. I dunno if it does more dps, but holy shit I am having WAY more fun with it. It FEELS like a warrior should.
[0:40:11] junkilolzaa: when u get 3rd in OTK tourament and esfand comes onto the field u can call out blizz
[0:40:16] GoodGuyEli74: ya I tried to bring that up with hunters last phase and ppl couldn't get past them being strong it was about playing BM auto attacking sending a pet in while afking
[0:40:17] OGTigolebitties: season of cuckery
[0:40:20] tilliees: i feel like SoD is about trying new things
[0:40:28] NutterCircus: enh sham is fun
[0:40:30] Trybadtv: warriors need a range spec, they just toss axes with the thrown weapon skill that noone uses
[0:40:34] Selecktt: DW
[0:40:40] miloxz: dw all the way
[0:40:51] NutterCircus: Tomorrow two-handers will be amazing for sham.
[0:40:55] Eclipz3d: like pvping as enhance with double rockbiter is boring af, 2h is unplayable by comparison
[0:40:57] st0neh: Kinda feels like warrior right now is the vanilla ret of SoD KEKW
[0:40:58] Zanketsuk3n: warrior in sod is basically "congratulations you can use 2h on pve"
[0:40:58] The_Crane: Shamans are dope rifht now
[0:41:03] Astralthundr: DW is BiS but 2h is the aesthetic :D
[0:41:04] kevo_k: @Trybadtv tazdingo warrior
[0:41:07] yarrpeter: My lock is fun, my priest is fun, my shaman is fun, my hunter is fun, my warrior plays the same it did in 04 LUL
[0:41:08] ObrezKnight: Worst part isn't that warriors are so shit it's the armies of blizzard defenders gloating at warriors not having a role to play...
[0:41:13] Gyrospeter: why? y but they are now too. first two bosses warris pulling 1k+ dps. our warri is doing 800+ dps first two bosses. look at logs
[0:41:14] sand_pump: warriors need a deathgrip or something
[0:41:16] Billpaul3: the SPEAR
[0:41:19] junkilolzaa: bladestorm will prolly b a rune
[0:41:21] Selecktt: There is zero downtime. Just get up and go. No mana? shamanistic rage. No health? Heal. Blast things down. HIGHLY recommend an enhance alt.
[0:41:22] Billpaul3: idk why they didn't get the spear
[0:41:28] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii

[0:43:32] kevo_k: heroic leap would be dope lol
[0:43:40] Nooshbag98: its so fucking bad
[0:43:41] ScottyUSMC: sir I play a feral Druid I dont want to hear it haha
[0:43:42] OGTigolebitties: warriors should for sure have a reflect
[0:43:43] yarrpeter: Warbringer is the only fun rune
[0:43:45] Pixiepantss: Sadge
[0:43:47] PayGorn95: should be 75%
[0:43:47] kilkott: i knew they would be careful with warrior in SoD so i didnt roll one
[0:43:50] Less_CW: you're living for 10 seconds?
[0:43:51] rawlexdota: Thats good for lvling kekw
[0:43:54] Zolacee: i mean warrior got charge, cept, vene... those are fun right?
[0:43:58] st0neh: 10 seconds if the melee hunter is AFK Keepo
[0:44:02] MykeyP: yee pvp is in a bad spot, healers are basically useless
[0:44:16] vibe11789: I feel like a knock back ability would be hella fun
[0:44:17] csant1023: They just need to nerf damage across the board
[0:44:19] Zanketsuk3n: intercept is shit the way it works right now
[0:44:21] WallisWarkimo: @MykeyP all ive been crying about. how can u heal when combat is less than a cast
[0:44:23] ilovestarfire777: what about the blood craze talent back then healing you for 4% over 6 sec after being a victim of a critical strike ;p;
[0:44:25] ObrezKnight: tbh if you shield wall, enraged regeneration Aaaalmost, works...
[0:44:37] Ken_Bones: anyone realize it says Tauren Warrior lol
[0:44:41] MykeyP: facts @WallisWarkimo
[0:44:50] Winttyrr: @SONII i had an idea for enraged regen actually: it needs a buffed active effect, no argument there. but then i think an additional passive effect that increases all healing on the warrior, including the fury talents like blood craze and blood thirst
[0:44:59] kigami_uro: Shift F says it
[0:45:00] WallisWarkimo: Just nerf pvp dmg with like 30% and we might have something
[0:45:05] Ken_Bones: inspect yourself
[0:45:07] NutterCircus: Was thrown off watching sonii in a raid and seen was a cow.
[0:45:11] Zolacee: ive seen that stomp brotha
[0:45:21] st0neh: Small indie studio
[0:45:32] Tandersonp99: the damage is out of crontrol
[0:45:35] Nooshbag98: you dont, STV is fucked
[0:45:45] Ken_Bones: yo Sonii, hope you are well man
[0:45:45] Nightbot: yo
[0:45:55] efracozz: What with the hair  LOL
[0:45:56] MykeyP: BUT THEYRE HOT TOPICS POGGERS
[0:46:00] makatoottv: ur hir is sick tho
[0:46:01] Zanketsuk3n: we have nowhere to complain about warriors
[0:46:02] ObrezKnight: SELF IMPROVEMENT! MEDITATION! CHADCORE ENERGY! GO!
[0:46:03] Yelawtv: You like when they talk about ur hair you gay :D
[0:46:12] Nooshbag98: Pog 10
[0:46:12] moonweaverx: yo be fair a lot come to your sever to learn about warrior lol

[0:46:14] inyoface009: the number 1 warr is fury with dw btw
[0:46:22] NutterCircus: 10 HP Pog
[0:46:26] slat_ppc: huge man 10hp is massive, nerf warriors
[0:46:26] Turkeypitz: Ironic though that Samson (a legendary warrior) become weak when he lost his hair
[0:46:26] Zolacee: 10 hp Pog
[0:46:28] The_Venom_Inside: noggin*
[0:46:32] F4bsl: free 10 Pog
[0:46:41] Laxxean: i mean, they dont care about pvp so
[0:46:42] sovngardener: @inyoface009 season of discovering dual wield fury is top tier who would have thought
[0:46:44] WallisWarkimo: 10hp Pog thats 1/10th of hunters pets 1 hit
[0:46:50] MykeyP: @SONII a lot of tooltips are bugged, like Feline Swiftness still says it only works outdoors
[0:46:56] st0neh: I think the fact that for a while HUNTERS were the best melee in the game says a lot about how Blizzard may wanna test more
[0:46:56] Tandersonp99: I have the epic axe and it doesn't get better. You might hit a little harder but still dead in 2 seconds
[0:46:58] tsetse2fly: have you ever applied @SONII or talked to them seriosly?
[0:47:00] Zolacee: 10 health points holy fuuk
[0:47:03] slat_ppc: How much rep do you get for Lumber hand ins?
[0:47:10] ObrezKnight: Lightweight Chain Rune! THrow weapon and pull it back with the chains!
[0:47:15] ObrezKnight: range warriors!
[0:47:17] NutterCircus: You dont want to work for blizz.
[0:47:28] tsetse2fly: For SoD right? @SONII Or ealier
[0:47:30] Curtbrainfre3z: but they dont care!
[0:47:34] Stars69: *gets automated response*
[0:47:37] st0neh: I'm sure his intern enjoyed it @SONII
[0:47:37] Pixiepantss: tldr
[0:47:39] csant1023: They want a TLDR
[0:48:24] Quigles: idk how you handle stv between layers and lag I cant do it
[0:48:28] st0neh: Highest rated pineapple hair warrior in MoP
[0:48:58] whd123: what kind of keyboard you using
[0:49:06] Quigles: solo shuffle the best thing of recent pvp and it only took 9 years and queues are still 45 minutes
[0:49:10] Zolacee: makes sense
[0:49:12] YouuRangg: aggrend seems real selective maybe Im reading into it too much
[0:49:13] Doribob1: what up SONII
[0:49:14] kleptos18: @diangelino imagine being this dweeby
[0:49:15] Billyonairetv: you got bamboozled
[0:49:20] Pixiepantss: payoS
[0:49:22] ElleBelleChan: sonii!!! your hair looks so good, it really suits you! :D (i hope thats okay to say!)

[0:49:34] jmslash: and I'm usually rude
[0:49:35] WallisWarkimo: KEKW
[0:49:36] cnxt1101: another one bites the dust
[0:49:36] ObrezKnight: BAN THEM ALL
[0:49:37] benbreezi: he sounds insecure
[0:49:37] rocky_93: payoGtfo payoGtfo payoGtfo payoGtfo
[0:49:39] terrible_cereal: THE HAIR
[0:49:41] cruci5y: ppl are so weird
[0:49:41] terrible_cereal: whatd i miss
[0:49:51] tsetse2fly: @SONII Tbh majority of time the top end arena players or mythic raiders give feedback they do it from their narrowed perspective of the top 1% or less.
[0:49:51] Nukefridge_: why do people feel like they HAVE to comment on EVERYTHING, just appreciate the moment and chill
[0:49:51] grumpsta935: we all had high hopes for sod, and sadly if your not playing the flavor of the patch class, your ignored :(
[0:49:54] Zolacee: aand hes gone
[0:49:57] Doribob1: bro i went platinum blonde, its true, Blondes have more fun
[0:49:59] Korvynah: NICE HAIR BRO LOOKING HOT ASF
[0:50:03] itsmistero: @SONII retail warrior best version of warrior by far
[0:50:05] JCRainFGC: sovrn_lol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! hello brother! do you still heavy bag train?
[0:50:08] bigd2017: how did your irl friends react to your new hair look?
[0:50:18] coastalhappiness: What's the most played classes in sod ?
[0:50:20] Agopkaa: What do you think of rogues? They seem to be really bad in pvp and pve. Very bad.
[0:50:29] Korvynah: shits fire
[0:50:32] F4bsl: it is pog dude
[0:50:39] efracozz: animu sonly löl
[0:50:41] ElleBelleChan: it looks great!
[0:50:41] lukelalonde: it's pog as hell
[0:50:44] Vashlolz: I get a little MGK vibe off it!
[0:50:48] coastalhappiness: @agopkaa That's not true
[0:50:49] Pixiepantss: awe <3
[0:50:53] MykeyP: LETSFUCKINGOOOO GRANDMAMMY
[0:50:54] HawaiianSpaceLasers: about 20 years younger KEKW
[0:50:54] slat_ppc: Grans approval is bis
[0:50:56] ObrezKnight: You gonna learn some anime catch phrases?
[0:50:57] omidiart: @SONII you do look younger.
[0:50:59] yarrpeter: My mom likes my hair! She said i look younger too! Haven't shown my gram yet LUL
[0:51:02] Agopkaa: It is mate, they are really really bad.
[0:51:12] Agopkaa: Especially compared to other classes
[0:51:15] NutterCircus: hamaws are soo great. <3
[0:51:18] Quigles: as fun of bfa corruptions were - it proved they dont actually care about pvp in any sort of competitive capacity
[0:51:21] Zolacee: ☺️ granny vibes are the best
[0:51:27] ObrezKnight: blizzard started to listen to the collectivist raiding class and the game got ruined for ever
[0:51:27] lukelalonde: however, the light on your face is too bright
[0:51:30] einself111: they did that with retail raiding and it sucks
[0:51:31] jimg3: i thought blizzard didnt care that much about pvp
[0:51:38] ObrezKnight: you wanna listen to your RP pvp andys though
[0:51:39] pearljamed: where did you find those haircutters
[0:51:41] omidiart: @SONII I think top 1%'s analytical thinking is needed for constructive feedback.
[0:51:41] choochiiee: ya cdew breaks down everything and just actually learns the numbers
[0:51:50] ElleBelleChan: i think the top 1% is relevant in retail, but SoD is basically free beta testing (which im not against) - people just taking it too seriously imo
[0:51:51] coastalhappiness: @agopkaa They are one of the top dps classes in PvP
[0:51:52] Oreo_Swagwagon: I'm not a fan of the hair. But that's my opinion and I don't need to call you a non-binary w/e and be rude about it
[0:51:53] justpeacealways: You dont think its offensive to people in wheelchairs to reference a class to being in a wheelchair?
[0:51:54] Sneakzx: They should do what runescape does and have the community vote on everything
[0:51:56] Zolacee: yea on camera ;D
[0:51:56] OrganikCum: MoP class design was amazing, they changed everything because of casuals crying on the forums and then we got WoD class design
[0:52:00] coastalhappiness: What's the most played classes in sod ??
[0:52:07] itsmistero: @SONII try dimming the lights ;)
[0:52:21] CAD604: thats blizzard in a nutshell
[0:52:34] Doribob1: i like seeing retail players complaining about how often sod gets updates
[0:52:35] tsetse2fly: @SONII Not saying you did but in general it's like that often. I disagree about them should listen to top 1% more. Hell even Asmongold argues that Blizzard listened too much on top 1% players and that's what made retail bad.
[0:52:39] NutterCircus: Esport SOD and parsing KEKW
[0:52:41] Fragtrip: hey man  @SONII
[0:52:41] Agopkaa: @coastalhappiness how is that true? They are only good in 1v1. When it comes to group fights, battlegrounds, they are awful
[0:52:42] ElleBelleChan: oh yeah for sure, warriors definitely need some love to feel fun to play, i didnt mean it like that sorry!
[0:52:45] Smoothieluv: What would you change?
[0:52:49] moonweaverx: literally just get an add on twitch with hair thinning XD
[0:52:50] jimg3: u got a playlist for this mix?
[0:52:50] Selecktt: Brown number too big long time in raid. Warrior not deserve fun
[0:52:54] Agopkaa: I'd love to hear @SONII input on that
[0:53:02] SONII: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6n5h8l1i3E
[0:53:07] jimg3: ty <3
[0:53:08] coastalhappiness: @agopkaa I mean ur probably just bad at the gane
[0:53:10] Agopkaa: Rogues
[0:53:23] sneakypky93: straight up Ken from barbie!! digging it!
[0:53:26] Ypsirc17: yeah rogues are solid all around
[0:53:38] cruzjc1991: I'm here PrideRise
[0:53:44] NutterCircus: Rogues are about peeling
[0:53:53] tyki_tries: tyki_tries subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:53:56] Agopkaa: True, I am not the best rogue player, but it seems to me it's not that good. I used to play warrior and zug zug. I find it difficult to navigate as a rogue.
[0:54:02] Zolacee: forcing trinkets and swapping...
[0:54:09] slat_ppc: We do, but once you use them its gg for like 5mins
[0:54:09] FlySkeez: zaddy
[0:54:13] Chipnizzle: MGK streams wow?
[0:54:30] necromahr: what is your opinion on warlocks in pvp? i feel thesy are not very good at the moment
[0:54:35] FlySkeez: !server
[0:54:35] Nightbot: SOD - Crusader Strike (RPPvP) Horde ; HC - Defias Pillager Alliance
[0:54:56] Agopkaa: I love ZUG ZUG haha :D
[0:55:05] FlySkeez: im still trying to figure out my main on SoD
[0:55:09] FlySkeez: havnt found anything i really like
[0:55:15] Andrettiixd: Lock 1v1 is s trong
[0:55:16] Zolacee: combat can go zugzug once every cd rotation :D
[0:55:19] Zanketsuk3n: warlocks seem good at pvp through the eyes of warrior
[0:55:21] NutterCircus: I always think of a rogue as a ninja, pop in and out.
[0:55:21] jimg3: getting to cast spells on lock is rough in bgs atm
[0:55:31] Sashieme: is that ur knee up?
[0:55:32] OrganikCum: as a spriest, we need buffs xD
[0:55:43] Sashieme: looked like a penguin outfit
[0:55:45] 91nobody: @jimg3 thats why you play affli
[0:55:47] MykeyP: damn!
[0:55:47] Less_CW: i was a druid and decided to make a warrior thinking it'd be fun. i'm a druid again
[0:55:51] Pixiepantss: COCKA
[0:55:52] Barokoshama: Warriors could use Spell Reflect, that would be pretty sweet
[0:55:53] tyki_tries: im enjoying my warrior, but it does get feels bad compared to the power that other classes are bringing
[0:55:54] efracozz: warr are so slow to lvl
[0:55:56] FlySkeez: one could say WOOH DOGGY
[0:55:59] jimg3: @91nobody affli dmg sucks
[0:56:00] Zolacee: why is it so white COCKA
[0:56:03] Jinz109: yo what size is the hoodie?

[0:56:17] Selecktt: Highly recommend everyone make a warrior and main it for a while. When you go back to your class you'll be having much more fun.
[0:56:19] vngoon: holy rap
[0:56:22] vngoon: crap
[0:56:22] NutterCircus: Thank god they removed cancel form for basic druiding.

[1:05:35] Blide: what do you main ijkovy
[1:05:42] Zolacee: o7
[1:05:49] iJKOVY: mage
[1:05:54] napb0y: how do u have 3.3k hp Oo best i can do is 1,5 on my feral kekw
[1:05:58] NutterCircus: Would have been cool if they selected a player randomly to be the guardian of the Loa boss.
[1:06:06] omidiart: this is like pre- nex xpac launch pvp lol. people just die in 2 hits lol
[1:06:19] omgitzalexis1: THE HAIR

[1:06:35] mercifultortoise: Payo got what he wanted gg
[1:06:43] st0neh: Blizzard has been pretty quick to respond to shit with SoD so far, kinda weird they're taking so long to address the damage
[1:06:49] moonweaverx: ya before i had fun but now i just dont go to STV
[1:06:54] Fragtrip: lag is brutal
[1:06:58] voteforpedro064: its sometimes very bad and sometimes bad
[1:07:03] skimansr: bad during peak times, not bad off hours
[1:07:04] gwk_exclusive: Blinded by the light! revved up by a duece, another runner in the night
[1:07:05] quttersraga: u still playing with ww axe?

[1:07:17] csant1023: 1 out of like 4 STV's are ok for me.
[1:07:28] st0neh: @quttersraga Looks like the icon on his bad, bottom rightr

[1:07:43] quttersraga: @st0neh tru
[1:07:57] moonweaverx: i did lvl fast so there wasnt that many people so there was that as well
[1:08:12] st0neh: Warriors gto kinda robbed with the whole STV mace thing but not as hard as hunters Kappa
[1:08:38] Dunstay: Who are you? Where is SONII
[1:08:38] Zanketsuk3n: STV event is amazing and I love it
[1:08:47] rasgrulz: this is soniD
[1:08:58] Blide: How is warrior just wpvp vs the average players? 1v1
[1:09:06] moonweaverx: i would get about 700 to 800 blood but now with lag i get about 100 lol
[1:09:31] gwk_exclusive: soniii D whats the D stand for. forever curious
[1:09:52] terrible_cereal: Sonii got a new cut, got him on the main screen life is good
[1:09:52] rasgrulz: tbh warrior should scale better at 60 ofc with gear, but with people getting 1 shot already idk lol
[1:09:56] vngoon: hey is pork really bad for gains?
[1:10:16] nickjames0: Honest opinion, rate blood moon event out 1-10 use decimal points
[1:10:25] st0neh: I'm convinced Blizzard just needs to increase the amount of stamina we get per level to juice health as we level
[1:10:31] gwk_exclusive: @vngoon pork is bad for everything lol dont eat too much
[1:10:39] JoeBangles_: the trichinosis
[1:10:39] ezarr123: nitrates
[1:10:41] vngoon: man, i love me some pork
[1:10:53] st0neh: A nice fat pork chop

[1:12:00] juicieez: @sonii have u ever tried any other classes yet on sod ?
[1:12:02] gwk_exclusive: bad for the liver
[1:12:09] napb0y: the amount of coins u are getting is too much, LuL
[1:12:10] st0neh: I will say though, Blizzard did say it was gonna be a clusterfuck and they were right lol
[1:12:18] Fragtrip: this event is so cool i wish it didnt lag as much
[1:12:19] Zolacee: all i know pigs are such dirty animals
[1:12:24] Zanketsuk3n: i think as a warrior you're just an easier target. Since they'll see your healthbar right next to them
[1:12:41] st0neh: Pigs really aren't dirty, no idea where that misconception came from
[1:12:48] Blide: is it possible to see your stance bar?
[1:12:58] einself111: lot of trust me bro science in this chat
[1:12:59] nicklasbirk: Melee benefits more from lag than casters imo
[1:12:59] vngoon: dont they eat anything available to them?
[1:13:01] Zolacee: ik im trolling its just something my dad said to me when i was young :D
[1:13:13] st0neh: So do goats, nobody says goats are dirty lol
[1:13:18] mercifultortoise: Noway
[1:13:27] Zanketsuk3n: "you are too far away"
[1:13:33] xperiment01: Rogue is the worst in this lag
[1:13:33] Zolacee: well.. younger
[1:13:37] Fragtrip: he is right, its harder to cast in lag vs playing mele
[1:13:43] lion_the_ryan: lol you died before the debuff wore off
[1:13:44] madmango131313: non castbar range
[1:13:46] Fragtrip: in my oppinion
[1:13:51] SIMME2K: it is ye
[1:13:55] st0neh: Having played both sides it's just shit for both lol
[1:14:00] SIMME2K: melee benefits
[1:14:01] mercifultortoise: Disc priest is so easy in lagg. Its way easier cuz ppl cant deal dmg
[1:14:03] PandouZ: Well our spells dont go off cuz of high latency LUL
[1:14:09] Garthd: Undead male warrior, GOAT
[1:14:10] MykeyP: i think hunter is bis in lag, just send the pet
[1:14:11] godsgiftphini: sonii never gonna believe he has the upper hand lol
[1:14:15] nickjames0: How much would it cost to get to Japan?
[1:14:31] kyidentity: hard to kick with lag
[1:14:32] rasgrulz: aware
[1:14:52] rasgrulz: not to mention most casters have blanket silence
[1:14:58] rasgrulz: warrior if u miss pummel ur fked
[1:14:58] CAD604: chaos in stv
[1:14:59] shioketv: hi, what runes are u using-=
[1:14:59] Spikeqc: @st0neh they are scavengers that's why
[1:15:07] omgitzalexis1: I'm going to Japan in April for the 1st time :')
[1:15:09] yarrpeter: I spent over 6 months watching flights before i went
[1:15:35] voteforpedro064: was watching netflix but when sonii started streaming had to put a stop to my show
[1:15:52] Zanketsuk3n: idk, it looks like mage was doing a ton there with all that lag
[1:15:58] Breakkyy: enhance buffs tomorrow legggggo
[1:16:01] legendarism: this week was awfull bro
[1:16:10] vngoon: can you still hide that red error text on screen with, /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()
[1:16:21] Mindtrick714: you still take aoe dmg when
[1:16:22] st0neh: @Zanketsuk3n Hard casting or channeling is the issue in lag, not so much instants
[1:16:35] Mindtrick714: when you have the dead debuff
[1:16:36] Al3omination: bro for a second I thought I was watching the wrong streamer with the new hair
[1:16:40] UncleRo: the hair!?!?!
[1:16:44] legendarism: the lag is real
[1:16:52] legendarism: worst than the morning lmao
[1:17:07] nickjames0: I just looked it up. Just to get to Japan via flight costs $2,000
[1:17:08] Genghish: Sonii is back in his super Saiyan phase
[1:17:08] Pixiepantss: save soap Madge
[1:17:18] st0neh: It's incredible how Blizzard just can't find the middle ground between layers and latency lol
[1:17:24] Spikeqc: @st0neh Scavengers consume leftover or dead material, and pigs, known for their omnivorous diet, will eat almost anything they come across, including scraps and waste.  that's where the "misconception" comes from
[1:17:42] cbrodeur6: Bro did you get my sub
[1:18:04] UncleRo: homie the hair is dope
[1:18:07] Zolacee: they wont do a damn thing
[1:18:13] itsquetzy: we just need an updated client
[1:18:14] st0neh: @Spikeqc So do goats though and nobody says goats are dirty animals
[1:18:30] st0neh: People literally keep goats to eat garbage lol
[1:18:33] R7SOKA: @nickjames0 what was this convo about? (joining late)
[1:19:05] nickjames0: @r7soka just thinking out loud, no convo
[1:19:07] wHaCkEdTV: yeah its expensive rn
[1:19:09] vngoon: nippon?
[1:19:14] Zolacee: @st0neh what have i started...
[1:19:17] R7SOKA: @nickjames0 ah ok. I have tix for end of June :)
[1:19:18] Spikeqc: @st0neh goat diet is primarily herbivorous, focusing on a wide range of vegetation
[1:19:24] Genghish: After covid flight tickets went to the moon
[1:19:26] wHaCkEdTV: i booked for april
[1:19:29] rider_96: Does Perfect Night by Le Sserafim sound like a NewJeans song to you?
[1:19:29] Inzanox: Bankaio
[1:19:44] itsquetzy: the worst is when you miss your flight and have to book the flight the next day
[1:19:46] vngoon: you dont have to go to japan, just go to your local japan town XD
[1:19:53] GodspeedSTEVE: everytime i watch you play its just lagg
[1:20:07] wHaCkEdTV: how close to the mount are you
[1:20:23] Dunstay: New hair looks good, but it's the opposite of glow up haha no offence tho
[1:20:28] Zanketsuk3n: hunter disarm is the dumbest thing
[1:20:30] sand_pump: warriors need a blanket silence
[1:20:38] Garthd: immune to disarm gloves when
[1:20:40] Fragtrip: auto swings will still go trough latency, casts wont, bcs u cant clip spells with lag ... over time that adds up
[1:20:45] Fragtrip: is what my point was
[1:20:52] Fragtrip: hunter sure but not casters
[1:21:12] FemboyQtx: i like the hair
[1:21:19] myodoctor: my dicks little no offense tho
[1:21:20] Zolacee: but the hair is literally glowing
[1:21:20] Archr: nice hair!
[1:21:21] elementum_ftb: actually a great idea for ranged disarm. rogues have r aanged stun and slow
[1:21:25] Inzanox: new hair looks good man
[1:21:26] TAXIL0L: what the fuck LUL
[1:21:30] voteforpedro064: Have you seen the new avatar show and if so whats your thoughts on it?

[1:21:36] averyjames_: it’s real
[1:21:37] terrible_cereal: thats a weird thing to say chatter
[1:21:38] boofnut253: i like the hair its sick
[1:21:43] diirtybum: People are still talking about your hair? XD
[1:21:43] gwk_exclusive: the life of a streamer/icon gotta love it
[1:21:46] Garthd: so many positive ones and that's the one you read Sadge

[1:22:05] grilledcheeseistasty: @SONII  what did u ask for for that hair cut what do  ucall it
[1:22:21] st0neh: That was wailing caverns all over again
[1:22:28] Genghish: Anime main character hair pls
[1:22:30] Zolacee: i think the hair looks great. Proper blast from the past and i fk with it
[1:22:30] Fragtrip: what happens if randomly everyone decides to team up against the boss?
[1:22:33] st0neh: "Oh hey the boss is here" Immediately hits the boss
[1:22:34] Dunstay: i didnt think it was offensive
[1:22:34] gwk_exclusive: I BELIEVE
[1:22:55] logic__: yeah debuff from dying to boss
[1:23:17] coastalhappiness: @dunstay What was the point of saying it ?
[1:23:32] the_real_chumanfu: Guys, my son turned 1 today! That went by so fast.
[1:23:36] st0neh: Warrior v warrior at 20% hp, the most clenched two assholes will ever be

[1:27:32] st0neh: Good news is @SONII now you have to run STV again later KEKW
[1:27:34] averyjames_: HOW ARRE YOU DOING SONII

[1:28:46] theekookiemonstaa: is there any point to play arms dps atm?
[1:28:49] coastalhappiness: @gwk_exclusive Is feral Druid popular ?
[1:28:53] Tyfonius: what time is raid?
[1:29:01] Zolacee: good number atleast
[1:29:01] gwk_exclusive: yeah everyone likes a feral in raids
[1:29:13] IAmaSwedishFish: what costs 100 coins?
[1:29:20] st0neh: If you'd just read one less chat comment you'd be done Kappa
[1:29:22] grylz89: I went full prot MT in sardacos alt raid, ngl tanking is way more fun this phase than dps
[1:29:26] metastep: what runes are u playing for pvp
[1:29:28] Tyfonius: yeah, just barely better
[1:29:44] trickypork: it's also easier to keep wild strikes up usually
[1:30:10] yaskweenishere: how much do you make a yr if you pull 1k viewers  a day on twitch?
[1:30:20] st0neh: Wild strikes is shockingly consistent
[1:30:21] Tyfonius: difference between WF and wild strikes is small enough that it won't make a difference for most groups
[1:30:33] nbagamer191: @yaskweenishere i think the income is based of subs no?
[1:30:41] trickypork: tbh as a shaman having totem projection on 0 mana it's not hard to keep totems up a lot either tho
[1:30:44] Tyfonius: but that does assume shaman keeps it up and doesn't die
[1:30:50] Seoken1: youd wanna watch a video on how streamers generate income, because there are like 10+ ways now hah
[1:31:01] Seoken1: its not just twitch subs and ads, but they make up a ton of it
[1:31:04] bogstark: solid battle on that little ledge at the ramp sonii you got me a couple times lol
[1:31:08] uroelement: Wf only applies to one weapon though
[1:31:10] gwk_exclusive: @nbagamer191 he's been affiliated with twitch so long a lot of it is ads
[1:31:20] nbagamer191: @gwk_exclusive true that
[1:32:10] st0neh: Uhoh he put the nip slip wife beater on
[1:32:57] docbhudda: todays my birthday sonii im 28 widepeepoHappy

[1:33:16] Selecktt: Wasn't there a point in time on twitch where they ran little banners rather than fully interupt the stream?
[1:33:22] Zolacee: LUL
[1:33:40] killrog__: like 10 years ago kek ?
[1:33:50] tsetse2fly: no, they just weren't that profitable earlier
[1:33:53] liuxako: adblock took banner out of scene
[1:33:57] omidiart: @SONII I still remember the day reckful put his paypal link in chat for people to donate lol

[1:35:15] Selecktt: They always summon in the baeldun digsite in mulgore. if you want to kill anyone, kill their summon bot
[1:35:25] st0neh: get on that priest and see if you're feeling it, if not just do other shit do you
[1:35:33] omidiart: @SONII you interested in other games? you don't have to only stream WoW.

[1:36:34] Av3nturA: hc next week
[1:36:36] st0neh: I think it's partly a generational thing @SONII a lot of people literally grew up playing WoW
[1:36:36] jakerose07: Wow 2

[1:37:11] omidiart: @SONII niiiice
[1:37:11] lion_the_ryan: who is Jim?
[1:37:13] Selecktt: Cheer100 At this point we need classic+ or a completely revamped and reworked classic. They cant keep milking unchanged vanilla. I hope they use sod as a springboard for that.
[1:37:14] docbhudda: fuck yeah LETSGO
[1:37:16] Zolacee: there?
[1:37:20] ElleBelleChan: PauseChamp

[1:38:00] TEEEEmac: no
[1:38:03] imiki34: @SONII Why do you think warr is boring on sod? Because other classes are busted?
[1:38:03] ryufromstreets6: no
[1:38:03] st0neh: Blizzard should treat SoD like Diablo 3 seasons and every year we get a new season where they merge the changes down into an era like SoD server
[1:38:04] helloiamlucas: sod is classic+
[1:38:09] hivemindqt: I thought sod was classic+
[1:38:09] Zolacee: doubt it
[1:38:12] Selecktt: Looking that way. Their "endgame updates" thing on the timeline seems to indicate some kinda classic+
[1:38:17] nitrodubs_: nah I think blizz is done. haven’t released a game in like 10 years
[1:38:23] NutterCircus: I would just want Blizzards definition of Fun. Sadge
[1:38:24] chris_hansen_son_4: I think blizz will see big SOD numbers, and make more classic+ ina  few years
[1:38:24] TEEEEmac: blizz thinks this is clasic+
[1:38:36] tsetse2fly: @SONII They distracted by Ronnie Coleman

[1:38:55] Trif0ld: maybe classic+ starts after 60
[1:38:59] MezeiPoloska: rogues are mid too, sadly
[1:39:07] Selecktt: I do think they are dipping their toes into classic+ and seeing what the reception is to major changes to classic is.
[1:39:07] Fierceee: Did you inspect me
[1:39:21] Fierceee: I have acquired an epic gun
[1:39:25] st0neh: I walked out of Gnomer last night with two tier tokens, the neck, and the crit mail helm lol
[1:39:28] CAD604: @Selecktt pls

[1:39:32] Somchi: dont hate me, but i might have got the 2h axe on my hunter

[1:42:08] logic__: top tank logs are using 2h and 31 in arms, might be the play if you get the 2h axe

[2:17:13] kevinxdelgado: you are the problem
[2:17:13] kyvcs: hinge is FUCKED for banning
[2:17:14] Zolacee: the worst she can do is say no. Keep it going brother man
[2:17:24] PeasantNoMore: Apps cant beat meeting someone in person tho
[2:17:37] DakotaHasHands: I probably got ghosted by a catphish but if she was real im the big sad
[2:17:38] kevinxdelgado: she could have been the one
[2:17:40] hoagie117: yes it can lol
[2:18:21] DakotaHasHands: if you really wanna meet women just get a new job lol
[2:18:31] soapbargoeshard: @SONII i have a genuine question. im thinking about going to japan for a little while to explore. when i lived in costa rica and mexico it was nice to already know a decent amount of spanish. did you learn japanese while you were there or recommend learning it at all?
[2:18:31] DakotaHasHands: but it WILL get awkward
[2:18:41] zestyqueso: Mage one of your main heals or he just off healing?
[2:18:56] fuudgie: is that your real hair? what happend?
[2:19:14] soapbargoeshard: do they have different dialects?
[2:19:17] boolgogiking: @soapbargoeshard go to korea. its better and english friendly everywhere
[2:19:19] DakotaHasHands: the japanese are not super friendly to gaijinn
[2:19:46] Selecktt: learned french and euskara. I think thats about my limit for additional languages.
[2:19:55] 501Boy: 501Boy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[2:19:56] boomboompaaow: yoooo tel them to mail me that idol of wrath!!
[2:19:58] keredj: I would walk around saying Subaru lol
[2:20:23] st0neh: I speak English and American Kappa
[2:20:26] ikuep: basque
[2:20:28] Selecktt: Basque language isolate. My family's basque, so it's their native language.
[2:20:32] soapbargoeshard: do they have different dialects like china?
[2:20:34] DakotaHasHands: like in some parts of japan you might literally be turned down living quarters for being a foreigner
[2:20:36] Zolacee: I had to learn swedish... and then forget it cuz i never use it
[2:20:43] keredj: Apparently there is a cool snow mountain with snow monkeys there?
[2:20:48] ikuep: northern spain southern france
[2:20:54] kevinxdelgado: would you ever move to Japan if you found a good Japanese girl?
[2:21:22] jared1991z: id move the girl to me
[2:21:37] DakotaHasHands: probably true
[2:21:41] keredj: Discriminate?
[2:21:50] jared1991z: i have soniaphobia
[2:21:53] corsair714: 100%
[2:21:58] keredj: That makes sense
[2:21:59] Selecktt: Longest known existing culture. Euskara is a language isolate, has no known related languages. Predates indo-european languages like latin.
[2:21:59] st0neh: I don't think people realize how different the culture is @SONII and how much that makes them stand out
[2:22:03] bigpunwon: bruh….what happened to your hair my guy????
[2:22:04] sethret: I had a restaurant owner come outside to our car and say no gaijin before we entered or interacted haha
[2:22:08] DakotaHasHands: if you go there and know respectful phrases in Japanese it's probably fine.
[2:22:08] avalaok: if you're foreign you need to adapt to the culture to a certain point.. nothing racist about that
[2:22:09] soapbargoeshard: yeah in mexico at first i was targeted for being white, but once the locals realized i was there for a while and just fully reponded in spanish. they give you much more respect
[2:22:11] noxdeath: The tallest nail gets the hammer
[2:22:12] sembrah: Holy, the words thrown around here kek
[2:22:31] st0neh: Even if they're not acting too crazy they're still acting weird to the locals lol
[2:22:34] wheeezyp: Yeah lol....
[2:22:37] poistay: just got back from tokyo & the snow, loved it, so respectful and nice
[2:22:38] Ombop: @sethret xD

[2:43:13] TakeMeToValhalla: retail war is fucking lit LuL
[2:43:15] outofmanax: p1 warrior was dogshit
[2:43:17] AsapBarky: i came to stream 1 hour ago and you were saying you were over talking about not wanting to talk about warrior anymore lol
[2:43:20] JonasDM_HS: still not fun in phase 1 tho
[2:43:22] ShinobiLive: I think they are trying to bring all the classes up to what a classic warrior is. Which is boring for warrior players.
[2:43:24] dredgdet: blizzard board meeting agenda item : Sonii DMs
[2:43:28] WiizyWeeds: warriors always crying lololol
[2:43:30] smashbyy: im glad warriors in the gutter sorry brother

[2:43:50] whadduprice: Pecks looking really unnatty today dude, I know you are but props to you @SONII
[2:43:51] yowler_: warriors boring and it sucks but there is also nothing to do at 40 this phase but raid log except for pvp which sucks balls on warr without a giga premade
[2:43:58] whadduprice: you are natty*
[2:43:58] DakotaHasHands: i play almost exclusively solo and im having the opposite experience lol @outofmanax
[2:44:07] Kingconn223: warrior is terrible right now
[2:44:14] hoagie117: like look at mages, its fucking absurd
[2:44:19] st0neh: Friendly reminder he's not even talking about warrior being strong or high DPS or PVP killers or any of that shit, he just wants warrior to actually get some fun new abilities rather than more boring ass passives
[2:44:19] smashbyy: what runes do you think warrior needs?
[2:44:20] NormalNomad: WOAH new haircut
[2:44:22] Pandameraa: I wish like Aggrend would play warri on stream, does Raiding and PVP and duels and looks what it is to be a warri
[2:44:26] NormalNomad: when that happen
[2:44:28] JonasDM_HS: WARRIOR IS NOT FUN AND NOT GOOD
[2:44:30] bigsugg11: broo no offense but u ppay a class that you hate so much. why dont you reroll just for a phase. no big deal. switch it up like other streamers
[2:44:43] vi7aka1: yeah give example of runes you think warrior needs ?
[2:44:55] Thraz_2p: this is a fire liquid mix, which one is it?
[2:44:57] outofmanax: @DakotaHasHands grp pvp is fun kinda atleast. Im full bis and feels good. Sure Shockwave and second wind would be amazing but other than that i cant complain tbh.
[2:45:06] bigsugg11: gladddd to hear brother
[2:45:07] JonasDM_HS: Heroic leap would be coom
[2:45:07] st0neh: @bigsugg11 He has a priest alt he wanted to go shadow on so the shadow dream is alive at 40 POGGERS
[2:45:09] JonasDM_HS: cool
[2:45:14] Lenzaloca: From High School Musical to Gnomerregan. Love to see it <3
[2:45:16] sand_pump: death grip
[2:45:17] KairuruTV: he just wants warriors to be fun at the bare minimum, not just the saem warrior as normal classic
[2:45:20] DakotaHasHands: heroic leap would be BUSTED lol
[2:45:21] MezeiPoloska: The other day on AB a warlock told me im half a class as a rogue in BG's, that hurt a little
[2:45:22] JonasDM_HS: and all the ones sonii just saud

[2:45:31] xBenww: bladestorm would be cool af
[2:45:38] soapbargoeshard: magic reflect
[2:45:54] outofmanax: bladestorm baseline p1? what do you mean
[2:45:57] slat_ppc: @MezeiPoloska Rogues are insane for pvp rn, just CD reliant
[2:46:05] Lopnk: give warr all that and keep the fights super ranged heavy.. so we can still see 232034024 warr and rogue LFG whiney constantly LOL
[2:46:07] MartianPK: if warrior had blamestorm i wouldnt have unsubbed yesterday
[2:46:12] MartianPK: bladestorm
[2:46:12] xarudo: bladestorm kinda bullshit for classic when not enough classes have escapes forit
[2:46:16] teboulol: yo whatsup sonii hope youre doing good
[2:46:16] Nightbot: yo
[2:46:20] JonasDM_HS: xD

[2:46:27] handy_grenade: wait the turd is already shiny?
[2:46:37] handy_grenade: oh
[2:46:38] CAD604: lmfao
[2:46:38] Zolacee: alright just bring back mop balance
[2:46:45] st0neh: They need to add bladestorm and every other rune they add needs to be a banger too otherwise it'll be too late already lol
[2:46:47] dredgdet: bladestorm at 25 would have been fun to watch lol
[2:46:55] KairuruTV: bladestorm is very meh ya lol
[2:46:59] outofmanax: I mean i would like shockwave, 2nd wind, and bladestorm. But i literally rolled of mage because of living flame for example. The entire class is based on one rune that is clunky, poorly designed yet OP. I dunno
[2:47:00] hottfuzz24: priest getting penance was goated
[2:47:03] xarudo: id rather warriors have heroic leap than fuckin bladestorm man
[2:47:05] michaelblack11: titan grip p4
[2:47:07] Kongapuss: would love new abilities that arent in retail/other versions of the game
[2:47:10] st0neh: It's like putting lipstick on a pig KEKW
[2:47:25] KairuruTV: fell like warbringer is the only good rune yall got on warrior lol
[2:47:41] Prevention6: @st0neh that's not nice cause pigs don't like lipstick
[2:48:06] vanax503: As someone who is also a warrior main, you're coping
[2:48:06] st0neh: But yeah one good thing is warrior has a couple very samey runes that do mostly the same thing so if Blizzard actually decided to do something about it they could just rework those runes @SONII
[2:48:11] Manimon_: its a contet trinket ^^
[2:48:13] boopbopbamski: Hi SONII looking very jacked today
[2:48:19] Ventor_: would u be ok if they add all the posible mechanics to warriors. but they made them bottom tier dps?
[2:48:19] soapbargoeshard: NINJA

[2:49:14] xarudo: warrior is passives: the class
[2:49:16] st0neh: @Ventor_ Marks hunter damage is considered dog right now but it's fun in PVP because we have a bunch of cool shit from runes lol
[2:49:17] noxdeath: warriors should get heroic leap
[2:49:26] sand_pump: its a shame the slam rune is so shit
[2:49:27] chilemangx: Blizzard "Best I can do is a Slam Rune"
[2:49:36] GingerStylez: i think they saw the logs and said : In classic, warrior is the best, lets keep like that, #nochanges, while they put in steroids all the other classes hahaha
[2:49:41] lebrun_james_: leather YEP
[2:49:43] MartianPK: lool
[2:49:43] Fierceee: BiS hunter gloves in Gnomer
[2:49:45] Manimon_: its bis
[2:49:46] Bigyun: i agree heroic leap has to be in SOD
[2:49:46] KairuruTV: the fact that they even think anyone has EVERY cared or wanted to use SLAM, is crazy to me
[2:49:47] whoswatching: Heroic leap would be great
[2:49:48] soapbargoeshard: FK THE HUNTER
[2:49:50] st0neh: @chilemangx make that TWO slam runes for the price of one!

[2:51:48] jamie7862: Shots fired
[2:51:49] Selecktt: @SONII Have you considered Green Whelp armor for pvp? 5% chance on being hit to put target to sleep for 10s. Normally overlooked because doesnt work above 50. But we're at 40 now.
[2:51:51] sand_pump: sardaco is literally top 48 @SONII
[2:51:54] sand_pump: not top 25
[2:52:06] Bigyun: it would be cool if they gave warriors a tryndamere style ult from league
[2:52:18] boopbopbamski: ROASTED AND TOASTED
[2:52:20] boopbopbamski: let em know sand
