[1:41:11] atlasglassstudio: jk bb
[1:41:21] JackSunn92: werent there like 50 people that played SoM?
[1:41:25] pint_of_milf: there's definitely a direct correlation between parse % and bodyfat %
[1:41:38] MrUntold: I had a 100 with the yeti :C
[1:41:44] NutterCircus: I didnt play SoM, it sounded stupid.
[1:41:49] hxzcc: yes and it also depends on what kind of group ure in
[1:41:52] HeIlraiser_: gachiBOP
[1:41:57] ATcaribou: was it mc, when you were like one of 2 warlocks who had mc kills at first?
[1:42:17] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: yes u go left

[1:43:22] hxzcc: ye its bettter
[1:43:23] SepeIio: its better
[1:43:25] lickmypetals: It dominates D4
[1:43:25] plumpus81: don't you dare shit talk D4
[1:43:26] Yarith: helldivers is the game RN
[1:43:28] WillowJane: from what ive played its in between D4 and PoE
[1:43:43] donkeebrainz: if i need a brain to play it im not playin
[1:43:52] osopolar1977: I like the electric wiz it’s like a shaman
[1:43:53] Raivan994: do you think blizzard will make new 40man raids at 60 or limit themselves at catchup 20mans inbetween phases?
[1:44:08] GetGachi: do you think warlock is the best tank in p2?
[1:44:13] NutterCircus: What the hell are they yelling? Is it some RP shit?
[1:44:29] Yarith: warlock can almost solo tank everything so ya
[1:44:39] Raivan994: i have a feeling of dread the whole discovery ends after the leveling part and then it's all classic raids with tuning
[1:45:08] ferryojerryo: Was that unmute the ventrilo sound? wtf
[1:45:25] ferryojerryo: Thats a memory I didnt remember I had
[1:45:51] linkitcraig: linkitKEKWalk
[1:45:53] BlownFuse_: you using pact on legs?
[1:45:54] Cubanito06: gay pile lets go
[1:46:08] DankWizard420: @Raivan994 so long as it's not 10mans anything else I beg YEP
[1:46:18] Yarith: @BlownFuse_ he is
[1:46:29] Cubanito06: thats a shadow priest ?
[1:46:51] tsetse2fly: @linkitcraig How is Last epoch? Have you been playing?
[1:46:57] Gravy2k5: I know it wont happen but one thing I liked about retail was scalable raids
[1:47:06] Roxannamyu: Anyone else have a horribly buggy stv just now?
[1:47:06] BlownFuse_: so many choices for runes this phase for tank lock. I’ve been using icin up till last 2 bosses. wonder if pact would be more personal dps or if it’s just good raid buff
[1:47:07] Raivan994: @DankWizard420 yeah 10mans aint my thing tbh hate the A group B group cliques meta
[1:47:13] kinyaz123: what chest rune are you running?
[1:47:17] HoosierHarry: damn lock threat is nice
[1:47:31] DankWizard420: @Raivan994 greatly contributing to the healer shortage too
[1:47:32] Yarith: i mean you can meta tank in every tree
[1:47:38] Cubanito06: which is nice
[1:47:40] rpiress: wow 447 dps
[1:47:49] Broly6905: !spec
[1:47:50] Nightbot: MY SOLO DUNGEON SPEC: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/5500253002201005
[1:47:56] BlownFuse_: I went 5/5 emberstorm couple nights ago. ran knowledge on boots and incin on legs. thinking about lake of fire for even further beyond
[1:48:04] SetDog1: how did you get so good at dps?
[1:48:04] tsetse2fly: Another 99 sstvRAVE
[1:48:09] Lostt_xd: does the other warlocks lake of fire still affect you?
[1:48:12] Cubanito06: do you ever do conflag? @StaysafeTV
[1:48:15] lost_tv: !realm
[1:48:15] Cubanito06: outside pvp
[1:48:29] Moo360: is conflag ever worth it?
[1:48:29] BlownFuse_: oh shit are you playing LoF?
[1:48:29] bweeda: conflag is so clunky in classic
[1:48:29] GetGachi: !tank
[1:48:41] shhoog: hey staysafe will people get mad if you show up to raid with just the gnomer buff?
[1:48:42] therottenfo: @StaysafeTV dude im staring to really hate MC its been fucking 14 months doing it honestly probably 48+ weeks a year, and i STILL havent seen barons binding...........
[1:48:53] BlownFuse_: damn I didn’t even think about the crit
[1:48:59] BlownFuse_: never even crossed my mind
[1:49:07] hirbelhumpf: why no demo spec for meta? thick pet
[1:49:10] ATcaribou: @shhoog like no consumes at all? BFD buff doesnt work at 40
[1:49:13] BlownFuse_: was thinking about LoF. it’s just a pain in the ass to use
[1:49:19] Moo360: shadow and flame
[1:49:23] Raivan994: @DankWizard420 seen people on reddit cry saying it's the gdkp ban effect , wonder if blizz comes up with role goodie bags in response
[1:49:42] domdizzle_: is there somewhere that describes all the new class specs? im thinking about trying sod
[1:49:47] DankWizard420: @Raivan994 the simplest solution is unironically dual spec KEKL
[1:50:02] Lamfao0: !runes
[1:50:04] Raivan994: @DankWizard420 yeah true
[1:50:07] Lostt_xd: lake of fire is 40% fire damage but I’m guessing from your numbers the other locks one is working for you which is pretty cool
[1:50:08] Anhak: @Raivan994 its not gdkp that was such a small % of the playerbase
[1:50:14] Moo360: @domdizzle_ there's a lot of guides on wowhead and icy veins
[1:50:16] ATcaribou: @DankWizard420 is it though? you still only get 1 lockout. if they wanted to heal they already would
[1:50:19] domdizzle_: ty
[1:50:29] BlownFuse_: how much the tailor helm run ya?? huge upgrade. Gratz
[1:51:01] TheWhiteRabbitxX: yeah not dual spec.
[1:51:05] Napknutt: raider dot io is a solid place for ripping peoples build xD
[1:51:11] BlownFuse_: lmao holy shit
[1:51:14] BlownFuse_: guess I’ll be waiting lol
[1:51:16] littlehak: getting cheap now
[1:51:20] DvOlii: you got WSG exalted ?
[1:51:21] Raivan994: @Anhak i guess so but also gdkpers padded raid logs with multiple alts too
[1:51:51] littlehak: salvage went down from 12g to 6g within 24hr on my server
[1:51:58] sudd7: get rid of gdkp's and add a bis helm that incentivizes gold buying. Kappa
[1:52:03] Anhak: @Raivan994 in general no one is playing alts yet or the people who are is only 1 or 2 etc thats the real padding. less than 10% of people playing etc
[1:52:06] jimg3: its way too much gold not sure i cba to farm that
[1:52:24] BlownFuse_: I swear they made this shit so expensive to deflate the economy from gold buyers
[1:52:24] Mansford: what potions are you using?
[1:52:45] taliwoush: What is your button mapped to 'X' do you have a macro to interact with the button?
[1:52:51] taliwoush: or is it a bomb killing one?
[1:52:54] ATcaribou: @BlownFuse_ and it just kills the rest of us who didnt buy gold
[1:53:03] BlownFuse_: exactly @atcaribou
[1:53:08] hirbelhumpf: has anyone tried the new alchi only pots from gnome? are they good/worth?
[1:53:10] OGTigolebitties: have you been using this same spec for bgs and pvp too??
[1:53:12] ATcaribou: which also means they believe a huge portion of players bought gold, or they wouldnt have done it
[1:53:15] Moo360: druid tank actually seems viable now which is nice
[1:53:48] Anhak: @Raivan994 the real stat we want/need to use is active players/accounts not whose clearing the raid
[1:53:51] taliwoush: druid tank is SUPER awesome now
[1:54:52] HeIlraiser_: left YEP
[1:55:03] qze_slipknot_212: W raid i believe!
[1:55:15] BudweiserDNA: o7
[1:55:25] Raivan994: @Anhak i know in my guild the raiding pool of player shrunk from 5 raids to barely 2 maybe 3 in a week, many people didn't come back after losing interest from long ph1
[1:55:35] qze_slipknot_212: 89?! GOD DAMN
[1:55:43] SepeIio: I'm rooning
[1:55:51] qze_slipknot_212: he is JUICED
[1:55:52] sudd7: is imp bis tank pet? to maximize that rune?
[1:56:10] DvOlii: ur using Demonicc pact ?
[1:56:27] Scaleless1776: I used to drink fairly heavily. haven’t had a drink since new years
[1:56:41] ATcaribou: @Scaleless1776 thats great, im proud of you
[1:56:53] Scaleless1776: @atcaribou thx dawg
[1:57:01] Aeil__: all the melee are getting destroyed by overheat
[1:57:04] Anhak: @Raivan994 if 2 months is too long of a phase for them to make the next phase better idk what to tell people. I'm sure some people quit already or the investment of getting to 40 vs 25 is a lot more. In general i want to see the numbers of the last 3 weeks pf p1 to right now which im sure the playerbase is larger. It does feel smaller with the layering tho
[1:57:21] ATcaribou: @Scaleless1776 youre welcome, thats a big deal. wanted to make sure it didnt go unnoticed
[1:57:52] Scaleless1776: I want to live long enough to see the next 50 years of wow content basically @atcaribou
[1:57:56] Gabe4D: someone's imp is still attacking dragon
[1:57:59] Gabe4D: IMP
[1:58:01] Gabe4D: its the IMP
[1:58:09] Gabe4D: oh god
[1:58:12] Gabe4D: its someones imp LOL
[1:58:18] Nightbot: @Gabe4D -> LANGUAGE VIOLATION [warning]
[1:58:32] Gabe4D: wtf
[1:58:43] Gabe4D: language violation?
[1:58:44] bweeda: cant say the M word
[1:58:46] JoeBangles_: EZ 99
[1:58:52] Aeil__: @StaysafeTV Consider kiting other bosses away from dragon when he casts overheat. It makes all of them 210 dps aoe on everybody near them
[1:58:52] Gabe4D: WTFFF
[1:58:53] Gabe4D: lol
[1:59:03] Aeil__: all of them do*
[1:59:10] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV That was your Imp hitting Dragon
[1:59:29] ATcaribou: yeah @Gabe4D backseat gaming is sure to be well received.
[1:59:36] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV another 99, farming them this run
[1:59:52] Gabe4D: @ATcaribou Yesterday he got mad at chat for not telling him he was not in moonkin form
[2:00:03] WiseguyGG: name change gone
[2:00:05] WiseguyGG: lol
[2:00:10] ATcaribou: @Gabe4D lol he also yelled at chat for backseat gaming haha
[2:00:16] Gabe4D: Well shit
[2:00:20] Synmachus: @Gabe4D That was sarcasm tho

[3:01:32] HeIlraiser_: people are doing that
[3:01:44] kalsizzle2: this isnt retail with free epics
[3:01:48] Angeroth: only run bfd for 14 slot bag
[3:02:07] Plathyy: Questing is kinda fun
[3:02:13] dreadd39: sell summons LUL
[3:02:27] vash61: I feel like the gnomer gear is underwhelming
[3:02:34] walid_jalil: @stillnick HC was a lot of fun during the first 2-3 weeks. Probably the most fun I've ever had in WoW. Community was awesome, lots of players, people buffing eachother and really being social.
[3:02:37] Sourr09: yea ive decided im not buying my alt a mount, feels un needed unless i do a lot of stv
[3:02:38] dave3ooo: @kalsizzle2 i mean with gdkps banned, actually all the epics are free except the crafted ones, that ya know, everyone can get for gold
[3:03:16] ShingaTV: the balance overall was still better then now... look those pvp 1shots
[3:03:24] LunaMoonCakey: im confused what are you farming?
[3:04:00] Totalko: @lunamooncakey he's farming views like always Kappa

[3:04:14] LunaMoonCakey: of course
[3:04:17] Blackout_x9: PepoSabers
[3:04:42] dreadd39: they had to get their users hooked and to come back for round 2
[3:04:43] Boumpie: useless curve
[3:04:46] CringeK: That Y axis is a bit weird, as strong as a 60?
[3:05:00] hennessy147: most of ZG as well lol
[3:05:07] ShingaTV: :)
[3:05:09] walid_jalil: really?
[3:05:12] Grimdotter: is that for just casters or all?
[3:05:15] wiild1: how is that?
[3:05:22] salk76: yeah 60 raids are not really gonna be viable apart from naxx
[3:05:26] fuguelah: mob health is all scaled up anyway
[3:05:30] caltex88: Caster itemization was so broken pre BWL
[3:05:31] MezeiPoloska: they have to tune the dungeon gear next phase
[3:05:31] CygnusC: all the hit% and spellpower
[3:05:32] borsko: spell power gear is insane
[3:05:38] salk76: They're gonna have to create new raids at 60, like karazhan
[3:05:42] Boumpie: captain obvious
[3:06:00] QuestFor420: yeah fr KEKW
[3:06:04] garbobean: insanity
[3:06:05] illegalstuff: Ban tok Sash tho Kappa

[3:06:16] lucasarino1: i dont miss the shitty bloodvine though
[3:06:24] caltex88: Bloodvine was awesome
[3:06:27] kalsizzle2: bloodvine is ugly as fuck
[3:06:41] CringeK: Or they could nerf BFD gear
[3:06:48] MrChaynes: its happening monkaS
[3:06:52] Boumpie: or buff the content
[3:06:58] sirblowsalot: and in turn the dungeons are dumb easy with the buffed loot
[3:07:07] vash61: I want more unique item models and sets
[3:07:07] HeIlraiser_: buff quest gear :)
[3:07:09] illegalstuff: higher lvl dungeons are gonna be useless
[3:07:14] illegalstuff: ye..
[3:07:17] Diabolikkgg: they are fucking up
[3:07:22] hailstormz: maybe quest look too
[3:07:24] walid_jalil: I thought the SM buffs was just them removing spirit and replacing it with spell dmg / healing ??
[3:07:26] Blackout_x9: sstvPls

[3:07:34] CrippinLimpin: they’re gonna have to buff MC-ZG
[3:07:38] overlandingaggie: whats the 50 raid gonna be is the real question, if we can already go in SM do you think they would make it a raid
[3:07:40] CrippinLimpin: craziness
[3:07:48] StunningPaul: If you look in ATLAS LOOT they have already buffed Uldaman loot
[3:07:49] Sourr09: KEKW true
[3:08:15] walid_jalil: @overlandingaggie I think so, but maybe a different entrance.
[3:08:30] overlandingaggie: wouldnt they have left gnomer open in p1 then
[3:08:48] Napknutt: is melee hunter the only viable hunter rn? sorry I know you dont play hunter currently
[3:09:02] walid_jalil: @overlandingaggie paladin runes also indicate that the SM story isn't over. In fact they strongly indicate that the Scarlet Monastery story will return somehow
[3:09:06] SepeIio: Deadge

Had to come to some hard terms that people who I'd known for years, who I thought were good friends, just weren't. Devastated me for a long time. Anyway, I'm leaving the industry - found new work elsewhere. This industry is really messed up, and what happened to me, and plenty of others, wasn't fair.

[4:28:42] ph252: u guys should settle it in the octagon
[4:28:58] sysfantasm: Everyone that's informed obviously think of twitch, youtube in more gamefied ways, in terms of what pulls viewers and subs etc, how to beat comp. It's just a fascinating topic.
[4:29:22] nrdoubleu: thanks dude, I’m in this odd place where I prefer watching streams rather than playing

[4:31:29] Fluffshock: Yeah isn't a Turkish sub worth like $0.30 or something
[4:31:29] NutterCircus: they were like 17 cents
[4:31:32] JoeBangles_: you could IP swap to Turkey and give 100 subs for like 80 usd
[4:31:36] teemohamster: they were money laundering through streamers
[4:31:40] MayorCraplegs: turkish people couldnt afford to pay for amoranths mansions
[4:31:45] xrazzaks: i think they were makin hella fake amazon prime accounts for free somehow and using the prime sub to sub to their channel LUL

[4:33:28] dreadd39: isnt twitch like losing millions every month still?
[4:33:33] JoeBangles_: It was only 30 cents USD to tier 1 from Turkey...
[4:33:55] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Did you see Turkey pricing under Canada etc
[4:33:57] NutterCircus: I can guarantee the scams help their financials etc.
[4:34:15] snoopychair: peepoSitWizard
[4:34:16] WiizyWeeds: bozo can take a cut
[4:34:21] Vitchman: Just got in. Is this Onlyfans pricing?
[4:34:24] andypandynz: aus and nzd are pretty much identical but now they pay $1 more than us LUL
[4:34:26] tsetse2fly: ok just wanted to make surry sorry
[4:34:33] HeIlraiser_: great for money laundering lol
[4:34:38] Raivan994: is trainwrecks going to have the last laugh?
[4:34:40] Rootwell_: twitch is forever
[4:34:41] dripa: did you see reddits financials? lost almost 100 mil last year and they are about to ipo
[4:34:45] Ranzorx: "chief monetization officer" this guy sounds fun
[4:34:45] carlosantonioar: did u get epic helm yet m?
[4:34:48] TheKraken2024: Isn't Twitch owned by Amazon?  Isn't it just a write off?
[4:34:50] razorback501: gotta pay those community safety people KEKL
[4:35:01] NutterCircus: As long as Amazon owns twitch, it isnt going anywhere.
[4:35:09] Snaketrap: YEP
[4:35:10] electric_f33l: i realise this too
[4:35:21] OptimusBanana420: no ads, why sub?
[4:35:23] tsetse2fly: @obg70 well, they still pay the streamers half of the money of twitch prime
[4:35:23] Rootwell_: too many degens no community
[4:35:24] endraga1: a rs streamer named odablock that guys goes ham
[4:35:27] dripa: I trust Amazon with my cc# more than kick
[4:35:31] salk76: less employees?
[4:35:32] zhuki: that reminds me i need to cancel my staysafe kick sub that guy never streams
[4:35:37] andypandynz: u get nothing for subbing theres no point for most ppl

[4:35:56] Buckwink: I have twitch prime just to avoid ads
[4:35:58] Salemanders: yup
[4:35:58] espenes95: got non of ur adds anyway (in norway
[4:35:59] Roxannamyu: what do you think of twitch turbo?
[4:35:59] DingzGaming: sadly me
[4:36:02] TheKraken2024: It isn't the primary motivation but it is nice.  Mostly for supporting the streamer.
[4:36:03] salk76: 2 in 1
[4:36:04] NutterCircus: Just pay for Turbo if that is the case.
[4:36:04] arcane_p: Imagine watching Twitch as much as most of us do and not having twitch turbo
[4:36:06] electric_f33l: i pay for turbo
[4:36:07] wisescience: it goes into my decision making. I like 3 streams so I pick one I want ads the least for
[4:36:12] SophicEcho: Holy shit I just realized you sound exactly like my uncle wtf
[4:36:17] c620w: Me
[4:36:20] Snaketrap: YEP thats why the make the ads as annoying as possible
[4:36:21] Voidbonx: in that case i would get turbo
[4:36:22] sysfantasm: So much of 'fast money' online is mon. laund., shadow economy stuff. It's symptomatic of bad structural problems. Very concerning, but what do you do...
[4:36:24] wisescience: He is your uncle
[4:36:26] NutterCircus: ded
[4:36:35] ph252: can you write off cost of wow sub on your taxes
[4:36:35] purpledrank210: ads aren't so bad if they support a streamer I like. How else are they supposed to stream if someone couldn't afford to sub
[4:36:48] mohihe3834: twitch has more employees than twitter
[4:36:50] Rootwell_: its a full moon! hamoonMoon hamoonMoon hamoonMoon
[4:36:52] NutterCircus: res at a ghost, you will play hell getting out of there.

[4:38:09] Rootwell_: funded by CIA
[4:38:10] ihaveabeard: they are not real viewers, kick inflates

[4:38:20] HeIlraiser_: ads are the area they walk around
[4:38:21] TonyTwoTokes: all sponsors?
[4:38:24] sysfantasm: Rhetorical question? :)
[4:38:25] ph252: dont tiktok stars make like nothing
[4:38:26] NutterCircus: Juicers.
[4:38:56] ihaveabeard: kick is boosting viewers because they want amazon or another company to buy them out
[4:39:00] orrenico: Do you think thats because kick has a mostly younger crowd?
[4:39:07] orrenico: im assuming
[4:39:17] Indomitablez: Doc went into it a bit and said they have lost sooo much money being on YT compared to Twitch. The viewer just isnt there
[4:39:18] HeIlraiser_: lots of aussie streamers getting paid by Tourism + some
[4:39:23] Sunderwire_: kick viewers saving their money for gamba KEKW
[4:39:30] sysfantasm: More people are adopting zero sum thinking, overall, in society. That's very bad but ongoing.
[4:39:33] BlownFuse_: idk, something about the kick app on my phone, i hate the way it looks
[4:39:34] Snaketrap: peepoGamble
[4:39:37] arcane_p: what made you start streaming @StaysafeTV ?
[4:39:58] NutterCircus: Getting wild growth? PauseChamp
[4:40:04] Rootwell_: twitch is purple = epic, kick is green = common garbo

[4:40:30] DuoX: how do i move to sweden?
[4:40:41] tsetse2fly: You don't
[4:40:42] sigilfish: moving to sweden KEKL
[4:40:47] sigilfish: just walk in
[4:40:50] Nytsongx: i just got on kick for roughly 30 seconds, clicked through a few streams and every streamer was screaming
[4:40:52] KKonaStevieG: PepoG
[4:40:54] DuoX: fell for that once already, never again
[4:40:54] Rootwell_: a swedish gay lolol
[4:40:55] Spearrit: @StaysafeTV its ok, many people will be joining you soon with ai and ubi
[4:40:55] NutterCircus: How do I move to israel?
[4:41:20] sigilfish: UBI isn't coming anytime soon
[4:41:22] sigilfish: they tried it in here
[4:41:25] Snaketrap: YEP
[4:41:30] sysfantasm: As a swede, I can say, welfare here is slowly getting worse.
[4:41:31] Slaanesh74: I think it's terrible for people
[4:41:32] NutterCircus: AI looks like its retarded.
[4:41:34] fox0_0wolf: Do you think we are living in a society of sociopaths and narcissists?
[4:41:39] Slaanesh74: people need a purpose
[4:41:53] sigilfish: didn't change much in here, happiness went up little bit, thats it
[4:42:07] Vitchman: You're purpose is to watch Staysafe
[4:42:10] tsetse2fly: you go north east dusk now
[4:42:17] Vitchman: Your*
[4:42:23] inspiredtv: find boar at worgens camp to East
[4:42:37] mohihe3834: gay swedes will conquer the stars
[4:42:40] andypandynz: @sigilfish im dumb but i assume downside= debt?
[4:42:52] malingonium: MY SON FOLLOW THE NORTH STAR AND IN ITS PASSING AURORA YOU WILL FIND WHAT YOU SEEK
[4:43:00] Spearrit: NA already had UBI, surprisingly. A mass unemployment event happened recently with Covid and people received stimulus checks which was a form of ubi. except it being funded by printing more money, its funded by productivity gains of ai
[4:43:00] tsetse2fly: It's a big ghost pig that pats
[4:43:01] Slaanesh74: People need to work.
[4:43:03] Arcsilin: what are you up to?
[4:43:19] andypandynz: @Slaanesh74 ppl need purpose which most get fromwork
[4:43:24] sigilfish: @andypandynz no really downsides iirc but positives were very marginal, we have already extensive and expensive social system in finland
[4:43:40] Nytsongx: no mount for the boomy?
[4:43:45] NutterCircus: He sold out... Sadge
[4:44:01] Slaanesh74: @andypandynz That's why I'm saying UBI is terrible
[4:44:05] SkyraStyles: yeah i got kicked out of 3 raids bc i didnt get wild growth as a boomy
[4:44:10] therealrickdiculous: nourish is the most pain in the ass of a rune ive done in sod
[4:44:26] SkyraStyles: so i just got it lmaooo
[4:44:32] NutterCircus: I thought it was pretty based telling them to fuck off.
[4:44:33] SkyraStyles: its hilarious to me
[4:44:36] SkyraStyles: but w/e
[4:44:42] Voidbonx: catJAM
[4:44:45] Spearrit: so whats the solution to unemployment from ai? Don't say ai won't replace jobs, it's already happening in the art world
[4:45:08] kingdulli: target macro
[4:45:09] tsetse2fly: try further east
[4:45:16] mysteriousm4n: he was far east for me
[4:45:18] Slaanesh74: People said the same thing about the industrial revolution
[4:45:26] sigilfish: there will be new jobs
[4:45:41] nearoz123: so what the heck is eveyone gonna do for money?
[4:45:42] Deomas11: Tech also creates a lot of jobs in the long run. Upskilling is key
[4:45:42] andypandynz: bro we already make up jobs we can keep doing it
[4:46:11] Mattysaiyan: Medicine putting Plague Doctors out of work FeelsBadMan
[4:46:14] Spearrit: except the previous revolutions replaced a narrow segment. the whole purpose of ai is to scale humans. whatever we can do ai can do better. ai doesn't compare
[4:46:18] lagginginironforge: @Spearrit If AI gets to the point where AI is replacing Lawyers, engineers, programmers, I think we will need to restructure the economy
[4:46:34] fox0_0wolf: i dont think AI will replace lawyers maybe im wrong
[4:46:38] tsetse2fly: further east
[4:46:38] lagginginironforge: The only jobs left will be physical labour
[4:46:40] Mattysaiyan: Target macro time?
[4:46:46] inspiredtv: spam target agon
[4:46:54] lagginginironforge: lawyers sound like the easiest to replace honestly.
[4:47:01] dibadibb: @fox0_0wolf Clueless
[4:47:04] tuggiesFTW: check map, I think he is further north
[4:47:09] m00n4nds74r: A.I? more like A. Gone
[4:47:09] Slaanesh74: Everyone thinks that the future is bleak. People find new ways to be productive.
[4:47:11] Spearrit: lawyers will be the perfect profession to replace. lawyers read a bunch of text and interpret the law based on that. perfect job for llms
[4:47:13] andypandynz: @lagginginironforge emotionless judges sounds pretty cool for big crimes
[4:47:13] coolcrazyguy72: schizophrenia is wild
[4:47:19] whywork20: left
[4:47:42] zhuki: @Spearrit medical doctors, radiologists, pathologists replace them with AI
[4:47:51] POSrobot: same
[4:47:52] whywork20: to right a bit but head left ways
[4:47:55] coolcrazyguy72: do you know Donald trump whispers to me at night?
[4:47:56] tsetse2fly: no he's further east
[4:47:57] SophicEcho: i thought it was inside the grove
[4:48:03] malingonium: Sounds like me frfr
[4:48:04] lagginginironforge: @andypandynz Now imagine the AI CEOs. Your productivity dropped below our quota for one week? My calculation determine we can replace you
[4:48:05] Spearrit: yes, doctors are basically the same but with medical studies
[4:48:06] Slaanesh74: AI isn't even close to being ready to replace most professions.
[4:48:24] Slaanesh74: You're seeing chatbots that spaz out.
[4:48:31] Snaketrap: HACKERMANS
[4:48:43] Slaanesh74: Art bots that can't even draw fingers.
[4:48:49] lagginginironforge: Programmers in the 90s were terrified of being replaced by SQL users too.
[4:48:53] Voidbonx: @Slaanesh74 they can by now
[4:48:56] Slaanesh74: Give it a rest with the AI doom and gloom.
[4:49:05] iknowido: yeah carte path rules are bad
[4:49:06] Spearrit: sounds like what you do with llms, except for 2 cents rather than a doctor salary
[4:49:07] andypandynz: @lagginginironforge ya gonna be hard to draw the line but no robots incommand would be a good start LUL
[4:49:21] mohihe3834: it's already implemented in health care, the ai gives a recommended diagnosis to every patient, just for the doctor to see
[4:49:34] POSrobot: The robot slave masters at my human exploitation gamps are actually really cool!
[4:49:35] tuggiesFTW: 3rd is southshore
[4:49:48] lagginginironforge: @andypandynz "Hey chatgpt, go start me a million dollar business. Thanks"
[4:49:58] Voidbonx: DinoDance
[4:50:21] salk76: can chat gpt do wokr for you?
[4:50:26] lagginginironforge: Im a programmer and also a mechanic. I'm good for whatever happens.
[4:50:30] Spearrit: its not doom and gloom, people will be relieved from their job and basic needs are met. sounds great to me. you might have to find purpose outside of a 9 to 5 though
[4:50:35] thatquidproquo: BASEDHALT
[4:50:44] Still_Clean: in the future everyone will have UTI
[4:50:45] MrSchneetzel: nope
[4:50:53] andypandynz: @Spearrit thats the hard part cause honestly a majority of people find purpose fromwork
[4:51:03] r0xorzb0xorz: fulfillment
[4:51:06] lagginginironforge: but imagine if the entire economy from the start to end is AI robots though, everything would be free.
[4:51:10] jrdnpls: I agree, sense of purpose is important
[4:51:18] KKonaStevieG: there should be yeah
[4:51:19] helloiamlucas: agreed
[4:51:25] lagginginironforge: AI robots mine the ores, process them, ship them, make goods
[4:51:28] crustydoodlesack: Lol, any healers around tryna run gnomer in a bit?
[4:51:58] andypandynz: rich people still work cause all that fun stuff will get boring
[4:51:59] lagginginironforge: AI would produce that too though
[4:52:03] Spearrit: @StaysafeTV People will have to come to terms with that, but the vast majority of jobs today are hated. Only a small select few are jobs that give fulfillment to people. There simply isn't enough of those or the skill ceiling is too high for many
[4:52:13] Frank4LuLz: sheep
[4:52:46] ruckusbringa: I JUST PLAY WOW
[4:52:54] salk76: world of warcraft?
[4:53:02] Spearrit: like what you are doing now? are you depressed?
[4:53:03] coolcrazyguy72: 100% people need to contribute
[4:53:06] POSrobot: 1. get UBI 2. live in pod 3. parse
[4:53:12] lagginginironforge: yeah but that would produce nothing the AIs havent already produced
[4:53:19] simplerick96: I’m an EMT and love my job but I’m also lazy POS
[4:53:20] Zuut_: by that logic every rich person would be lazy once they got rich? technically they could sit on their ass and do nothing, but they chose not to.
[4:53:21] andypandynz: @POSrobot teenage dream
[4:53:26] fox0_0wolf: 90% of peopel who work hate their job
[4:53:29] mohihe3834: the upper classes play war
[4:53:36] Snaketrap: Susge
[4:53:50] sigilfish: its much better
[4:53:52] andypandynz: yes
[4:53:53] coolcrazyguy72: Even if you just carry the groceries inside for your partner, or draw as a hobby it does more than you think :)
[4:53:54] Snaketrap: YEP
[4:53:57] Doribob1: i hate my job and id rather do nothing all day
[4:54:02] ruckusbringa: Im a builder and that shit has made me a better person
[4:54:04] jozuele: There are problem solving skills being challenged and opportunity to overcome in a job you hate
[4:54:12] ph252: do you see streaming to be your career for life
[4:54:14] lagginginironforge: @Zuut_ To be fair, getting rich requires a special type of person. No one in this chat could ever get Elon musk rich because you would likely cash out and retire at $10+ mil
[4:54:18] ruckusbringa: CARPENTRY WILL SAVE US ALL
[4:54:24] Spearrit: @StaysafeTV lol, I guarantee if you weren't a streamer and had to do that you would hate yourself and wish you could do nothing instead
[4:54:28] SepeIio: It took me like a year to get a job after college and I almost went insane
[4:54:33] SlurpRooster: All people need a routine, ei jobs. Even billionaires have jobs.
[4:54:46] SlurpRooster: If you don't have routine, you will go nuts
[4:54:46] VikkeLIVE: As an unemployed guy I agree 100%, I do nothing and get benefits and its not good for me, a job would be better for me in every way
[4:54:55] coolcrazyguy72: stay safe is going to upload his personality into the metaverse for a million when he’s 45
[4:55:04] sigilfish: @VikkeLIVE get a hobby, start drawing or something everyday
[4:55:26] ruckusbringa: Work is a grind but it makes you happy.. sense of achievement for the day.. otherwise ppl become expresso depresso
[4:55:28] Arcsilin: @VikkeLIVE same boat atm but i am a journeyman welder by trade
[4:55:34] MawblesPDX: Is lunar event over?
[4:55:40] ChillyHTX: you helped build the pyramids as ur first job i thought
[4:55:58] salk76: @VikkeLIVE I think theres a difference between living on welfare & having economical freedom
[4:56:17] ruckusbringa: its a personality difference  - some people are content to do fuck all
[4:56:29] lagginginironforge: Majority of people aren't self motivated. Thats really what it comes down to
[4:56:30] orrenico: based
[4:56:35] mohihe3834: almost all family fortunes are lost by the third generation
[4:56:43] POSrobot: You're not my real mom!
[4:56:54] NeoSpy: thats not true, thats very small % of people, most that you see, just super popular so you can see them everywhere
[4:56:57] Arcsilin: i definetly am right now
[4:57:07] salk76: A framework is important if they're tryna follow a path that's suited for people with a profession
[4:57:08] Spearrit: I argue its not the job that gives you fulfillment it's the feeling of burden like you are letting society down by not contributing. Once that doesn't matter anymore, not having a job will feel normal.
[4:57:08] ph252: you are right from what ive seen
[4:57:18] lagginginironforge: Thats a recipe for a successful entrepreneur
[4:57:21] Sawfthandz: @StaysafeTV ofc this chat are the elites
[4:57:27] QuestFor420: EZ
[4:57:32] lagginginironforge: but its also a level of luck on top of that
[4:57:34] Snaketrap: pepeLaugh most people don't want to lead guilds
[4:57:36] sigilfish: @Spearrit do you happen to be a communist?
[4:57:52] Arcsilin: i seem to go through these swings of self starting and being motivated for months on end then i get a spell of a month or 2 where i give zero fucks its strange
[4:57:57] spookyfrogy: I think when it comes to people who only live on welfare a lot of the doing nothing is no hope for the future
[4:57:58] Snaketrap: monkaLaugh
[4:58:06] Snaketrap: monkaLaugh little leach
[4:58:08] sigilfish: yeah, healers are gigachads
[4:58:09] salk76: Massive pug enjoyer
[4:58:09] Sawfthandz: Consistency, honesty, integrity and you'll have your successes.
[4:58:15] mohihe3834: starting a business is extreme risk
[4:58:23] Snaketrap: ICANT
[4:58:24] ripinchatwastaken: @WillowJane Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:58:28] Voidbonx: those never tried
[4:58:39] Snaketrap: YEP
[4:58:46] lagginginironforge: It's a rare recipe for someone successful like that. Charismatic + out going + self motivated
[4:58:54] Arcsilin: i defs always make my own grps
[4:59:08] NeoSpy: on rogue you must make your groups, or you literally never be geared
[4:59:13] dreadd39: half the time the higher groups are losers that care about gearscore and must have addons LUL other half are just lazy ppl who want LFG to do all the work
[4:59:15] Arcsilin: fuck that waiting for other ppl to initiate waste of my time
[4:59:32] moneyfornothing69: when it comes to raiding i always "return my shopping cart" and that tends to get me invited back
[4:59:35] AxelFromAustralia: people want free carry that’s why they don’t make their own groups
[4:59:37] andypandynz: pulling sickies is a thing for a reason
[4:59:42] yolomaster420blaze: nope LUL
[4:59:45] ruckusbringa: its being physical and interacting with other people and shit .. getting fresh air etc
[4:59:50] itsquetzy: LUL no walmart worker is thinking like that
[4:59:51] POSrobot: I think that's a normal view in EU
[4:59:54] ph252: unless you're like the mailmain
[4:59:55] ShaededOne: woke mindset
[4:59:57] lagginginironforge: japan
[5:00:07] lagginginironforge: North korea
[5:00:08] lagginginironforge: kekw
[5:00:09] NutterCircus: No normal person thinks they need to meet "societies" standards.
[5:00:21] Spearrit: @StaysafeTV well it sure as fuck isn't fulfillment. only a very small select few people enjoy their job and it gives them fulfillment.
[5:00:28] Snaketrap: KEKW
[5:00:32] sigilfish: but when do we turn into pets for AI monkaHmm
[5:00:33] reaperz14: Hey guys, is it normal to shower twice a week?
[5:00:47] POSrobot: UBI is just to keep the masses in bread when the IMF digital currency hits
[5:00:58] sigilfish: i sus Hasan enjoyer monkaHmm
[5:00:59] NeoSpy: like 90% xdd
[5:01:26] lagginginironforge: Having financial freedom > feeling fulfilled by my job
[5:01:31] therealrickdiculous: big true
[5:01:38] dorathydestroyer: I need to work for money but I love my job
[5:01:54] sigilfish: also having a shit job is good for growing purposes in individual level, it can push you to get better jerb than shoveling shit for 16 hours per day
[5:02:02] Slaanesh74: There's also a certain amount of serendipitous benefit that comes from work.
[5:02:12] Spearrit: I argue that fulfillment could be filled by literally anything else other than a 9 to 5. instead of relying on a byproduct of working for money, you could find fulfillment directly
[5:02:13] andypandynz: @sigilfish damn a better jerb
[5:02:22] sigilfish: @andypandynz my jerb!
[5:02:23] jozuele: What is money was no object
[5:02:23] lagginginironforge: You only hear these complaints from people not making good money or living up to their potential
[5:02:24] AxelFromAustralia: no one would work if they didn’t hav3 to
[5:02:25] mohihe3834: you have to do something
[5:02:26] NutterCircus: If you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life.
[5:02:51] kingdulli: I don’t work overtime because i love my job
[5:02:58] ATcaribou: i found a job that i can do without being miserable that pays well, and i find my fufillment at home and volunteering at church
[5:02:59] Slaanesh74: I interface with people I normally wouldn't. I help people in my daily life in my job. I've learned a lot about myself and others with over 30 years of work.
[5:02:59] sigilfish: its omega autists who can do it with ease
[5:03:10] ruckusbringa: pee pee and poo poo
[5:03:17] Slaanesh74: That wouldn't have happened sitting at home playing on a pc.
[5:03:18] Spearrit: well, sounds like you have found your calling in a post-scarcity world. helping others find their fulfillment :)
[5:03:22] andypandynz: @Slaanesh74 social life is def a thing for people
[5:03:23] therealrickdiculous: agreed
[5:03:44] lagginginironforge: humans NEED a feeling of purpose
[5:03:45] Slaanesh74: Met my wife at work
[5:03:53] therealrickdiculous: and lethargic
[5:03:57] chexmixz: Pursuit of pleasure death loop...
[5:04:04] lagginginironforge: and being utilized in your job without being exploited is a great way to get that
[5:04:10] salk76: dont do it
[5:04:18] Mickrispy: I live a fulfilled life off the McDonalds 1 dollar menu
[5:04:25] NeoSpy: its not cuz they need work, its cuz they dont know what to do with money, no expireance
[5:04:33] thetrinsition: little jammer playlist tn
[5:04:35] suicidle: where ya headed homie
[5:04:38] NeoSpy: if they have money and expireance they never will be depressed
[5:04:38] sethret: i cleared the raid i'm so proud
[5:04:44] malingonium: Why not take the zeppelin to grom gol again
[5:04:57] malingonium: Kappa
[5:05:15] Slaanesh74: There's a reason that the saying, "Idle hands are the devil's workshop" came about.
[5:05:17] SkyraStyles: its a little
[5:05:19] StrictLiability41: what is this song?
[5:05:29] fuguelah: sunfire is a dps loss
[5:05:33] Mattysaiyan: dont you have to not be in moonkin form though
[5:05:33] sand_pump: wildgrowth so good for pvp
[5:05:40] itsquetzy: what do you think about the housing market or the cost of rent right now?
[5:06:05] POSrobot: @Slaanesh74 is that a meme? wasn't it "idle hands do the devils work?"
[5:06:12] corsair714: Rent is disgusting makes me want to off myself no lie
[5:06:14] coolcrazyguy72: what do you think about clowns?
[5:06:14] NeoSpy: too much people in cities
[5:06:15] ph252: fucking over young people with these rent prices tbh
[5:06:20] Slaanesh74: It's a proverb. I can't remember which one.
[5:06:41] NeoSpy: everyone want to live in city not outside
[5:06:48] Mickrispy: You just save money then buy house, easy :)
[5:06:50] lagginginironforge: Extreme rent means extreme choices
[5:06:54] POSrobot: don't worry investment banks will buy all those houses and rent them to you
[5:06:55] Snaketrap: ;)
[5:07:02] Slaanesh74: It was always hard. I had to get a roomate in the 90s, because the cost of living was high.
[5:07:04] lagginginironforge: Big trends of sleeping in cars, moving off grid, etc
[5:07:06] tsetse2fly: It ain't the 50s and 60s anymore
[5:07:07] r0xorzb0xorz: high rent? NO DOG
[5:07:11] AxelFromAustralia: government pays half my rent I’m chilling, get an airforce wife and stop complaining
[5:07:14] Gabe4D: I got https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=216608/radiant-ray-reflectors
[5:07:17] Slaanesh74: This nonsense that young people have it sooo hard is crybaby nonsense.
[5:07:23] whywork20: haha all good man
[5:07:25] ruckusbringa: PEE PEE AND POO POO
[5:07:27] corsair714: Cheapest studio that isn't in the fucking ghetto in socal is MINIUMUM 2200

[5:08:25] Slaanesh74: Complaining about the situation doesn't change it.
[5:08:27] lagginginironforge: You know an economy is doing bad when woman move to sex work
[5:08:33] tsetse2fly: Human male warrior right?
[5:08:33] sand_pump: do you think self found will pop off?

[5:12:21] Sheldorisafk: Sheldorisafk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Grats on the move
[5:12:22] RCK316: time for TBC/wrath hardcore
[5:12:25] coolcrazyguy72: there is still a bunch of classic era players but it’s all endgame and boosting
[5:12:27] americanized44: and flying mount to shrink the world even more
[5:12:32] MFpatrix: flying ruins the world too
[5:12:35] WiseguyGG: original vanilla tbc and wrath were the best gaming experiences period , it will never be the same no matter how many times they release it
[5:12:37] idiotferaltko: i feel like the best world pvp ever was when sunwell released and isle pvp
[5:12:37] sammixi: i loved playing shaman in tbc
[5:12:38] sclow: I loved Nagrand open world pvp
[5:12:42] Slaanesh74: A lot of people loved TBC because of 10 man raiding.
[5:12:45] suicidle: ive been farming the insane title but i had a realization that classic is not going to be forever and i just cba anymore
[5:12:45] jaytullo: I feel like sod has missed the mark with that. too much focus on spells and new abilities and not completed zones
[5:12:55] iknowido: what are those worm looking things that you eat called?
[5:13:04] firemondave: do you think theyll deliver with the 60 endgame?
[5:13:05] mohihe3834: there's usally 1-2 companies with monopoly on every market
[5:13:06] tsetse2fly: YEP
[5:13:11] lagginginironforge: RIP
[5:13:11] Slaanesh74: Many guilds just did T4 content and ZA.
[5:13:12] POSrobot: Vanilla world, MoP PvP
[5:13:15] idiotferaltko: sod has missed the mark on nothing! im hving more fun in wow then i have in a long ass time
[5:13:17] Doribob1: gogogo
[5:13:30] WiseguyGG: it’s not the same tho , back in the day when it took a week to clear a dungeon and all the time effort and thought it took .
[5:13:33] rippedwaffle44: BC was great!! :) Forum post up now named "Please Blizz, One TBC Server" get your voice in there guys!!
[5:13:44] WiseguyGG: when gear meant something
[5:13:51] lagginginironforge: yupp
[5:13:53] ph252: classic+ with more quests, more details, completed zones, more leveling items would be exciting
[5:13:59] suicidle: grobbulus was a fantastic server for classic, tbc, and some of wrath. very alive world and wpvp was abundant. always so many folks around
[5:14:02] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Are you excited for SM and Kara Crypts raid?
[5:14:04] sand_pump: this man is swimming, whos doing that in tbc????
[5:14:12] Mickrispy: Do you like runescape?
[5:14:30] Nytsongx: doooood elden ring world immersion is so good
[5:14:32] sammixi: imo, world immersion is the only thing classic does better than tbc. tbc is better in every other way
[5:14:43] mohihe3834: makes you depressed
[5:14:46] prfdrlol: have you ever played guild wars 2?
[5:14:51] Slaanesh74: Flying mounts were a novelty that definitely ended up being a net negative for the game.
[5:15:12] andypandynz: retail expasions had no flying for months at the start of expansions it still sucked
[5:15:18] tsetse2fly: IIRC you didn't like gearing
[5:15:25] Multar_: guild wars community was so nice
[5:15:39] tsetse2fly: Pog wild growth
[5:15:55] iMattbat: rocket cleaver secured yeeee
[5:16:15] Qworalmarker: uses about a third of your mana
[5:16:29] DankWizard420: mana modCheck where you going
[5:16:36] Multar_: EZ
[5:16:46] Slaanesh74: The damage had been done with world design though. The game gets turned into "4 new zones, 8 new dungeons, and a raid per patch." That makes it so that people care less about the world.
[5:16:50] coolcrazyguy72: based
[5:16:53] bone555: So true king
[5:16:55] suicidle: agree
[5:16:56] Mickrispy: 40man
[5:17:00] way_back: 10 mans are sleeper asl
[5:17:04] oakenempire: true
[5:17:08] eshonxv: 10 man are soy
[5:17:13] px_aaron32: twenty twin twinnnnn
[5:17:16] DankWizard420: 20man is so much better to schedule too Sadge
[5:17:16] jaytullo: 20 mans and raid wide buffs. tired of managing groups and shafting some people
[5:17:17] oakenempire: 10 man is too limitting
[5:17:22] Nytsongx: is that confirmed already?
[5:17:30] TesservcT: guilds are gonna be so fucked when the raids goto 40 man. No one is gonna have the infrastructure to raid 40mans
[5:17:32] DankWizard420: SM raid? after having just done the dungeons?
[5:17:36] POSrobot: What will Blizz do after SoD runs it's course?
[5:17:44] andypandynz: @TesservcT nah they arent doing 40
[5:17:51] Multar_: has anyone checked down there yet?
[5:18:10] elijahwest00: Shit, you laid up rn, real chill with it
[5:18:12] lagginginironforge: Tbh all of SoD is a recycle....
[5:18:14] myooniii: Furbolgs in felwood raid
[5:18:14] Mickrispy: Do you think once SOD is done, they'll redo it with new talents all over again
[5:18:16] suicidle: i personally think that p1 lvl 25 was kinda sleeper
[5:18:18] px_aaron32: Make the entrance in the back side where the stables is
[5:18:26] snigglewhippin: change title you on boomy now
[5:18:52] ChillyHTX: whats a snigglewhippin
[5:18:54] itstnew: STAYSAFE! VoteYea
[5:18:55] snigglewhippin: LOL dont blame you
[5:18:55] arveholm: when do you think p3 will come?
[5:19:00] Still_Clean: theyll just do the next season x
[5:19:04] lagginginironforge: Defeats the point of "discovery" if they redo the same thing...
[5:19:08] corsair714: @arveholm Summer
[5:19:19] way_back: Just hope it doesnt get sleeper
[5:19:24] andypandynz: how many times can they relaunch minor changed classic before people get sick of it
[5:19:27] SkyraStyles: I WANT 40!
[5:19:29] corsair714: I would love to see new raids in SoD @ cap
[5:19:30] SkyraStyles: I LOVE SOD
[5:19:33] lagginginironforge: They're gonna run out of wotlk spells to back port omegalul
[5:19:45] carlos_dang3r: i.e. classic+
[5:19:45] snigglewhippin: you streamers are creating the content i feel like blizz is hearing what you all gotta say
[5:19:54] Nytsongx: ooo what if they add arean
[5:19:57] Nytsongx: arena
[5:20:00] Fulthrootle: Strand of the Ancients coming to SoD mmhmm
[5:20:03] andypandynz: an mmo live service game with only sub as income LUL good luck
[5:20:03] idiotferaltko: sod is huge! they def wont go back to classic. no way no way
[5:20:04] way_back: They gotta nail lvl 60 content
[5:20:05] lagginginironforge: They'll keep adding wotlk content until it's just wotlk lmao
[5:20:07] POSrobot: Can't wait for them to add Dungeon Finder and Tokens
[5:20:11] tsetse2fly: @corsair714 There will be, Kara Crypts already showed
[5:20:17] ph252: they should just start the whole game over and rewrite the lore
[5:20:22] andypandynz: they waited a few years to add tokens to wotlk, ur dreaming if sod goes years
[5:20:27] POSrobot: @ph252 monkey paw
[5:20:29] sammyincher: i think sod is a failure and they gotta go back to vanilla & try something else personally
[5:20:38] lemonchilllll: yeah lvl 60 might be were SoD breaks, they got alot of work to do there i guess
[5:20:38] Mattysaiyan: They got kinda burnt with SoM and having to maintain updates for a year with that but this is going really well so far
[5:20:40] sand_pump: cata baby
[5:20:42] AxelFromAustralia: they need purchasable cosmetics if they want to make money off it
[5:20:46] lagginginironforge: they need to make an expansion that isn't TBC
[5:20:47] Mickrispy: They go to BC+
[5:20:53] snigglewhippin: make another shit diablo and get a few million that fails
[5:21:02] suicidle: i think p1 shouldve been 40, p2 lvl 60 with fresh raids, p3 60 classic+ with new zones quests etc
[5:21:02] salk76: Would be fun to see you do some cata pvp
[5:21:05] way_back: cata ICANT
[5:21:08] Snaketrap: YEP FRESH
[5:21:09] johnnyhopkinwead1: @snigglewhippin last epoch just released
[5:21:22] Mattysaiyan: MoP classic though Pog
[5:21:22] helpdogsonmyleg: cata talents and class "feel" is great
[5:21:27] ImGravycakes: new content at 60 is honestly only way it will be "huge"  reworked 60 raids wont tickle everytone
[5:21:31] gary_ontwitch: the heroic dung grind should be fun
[5:21:31] suicidle: another aq40 opening style event would be so cool with a new raid or zone
[5:21:39] r0xorzb0xorz: cata heroics were pog
[5:21:40] andypandynz: sod is peak wow content with the budget they get its never gonna be more than small patches
[5:21:44] Brenno_Mc: hardcode self found sod
[5:21:49] lagginginironforge: blizzard wont put the money into making new classic content. At best they're backport content.
[5:21:50] salk76: :--------)
[5:22:00] Mattysaiyan: @MadJacker15 More loot
[5:22:09] cheesestinkfarty: im kinda hyped for cata
[5:22:13] snigglewhippin: you get 3x the loot
[5:22:19] DeadDawg68: no
[5:22:19] helpdogsonmyleg: nope
[5:22:27] Mattysaiyan: No but 25m is just more loot in general
[5:22:29] px_aaron32: Rbgs seem cool but like
[5:22:39] andypandynz: omg 10m heroics in cata imagine pugs needing to have responsibility LUL gg

[5:23:42] cheesestinkfarty: hopefully war within is cool
[5:23:43] Mattysaiyan: Every new expansion is great for like 2 weeks, even the shitters
[5:23:51] Gabe4D: late summer

[5:25:01] jikishunsen: hopefully you got the 10% swim ring from bfd
[5:25:06] andypandynz: cata is for unemployed eu gold sellers
[5:25:13] Mattysaiyan: @itsquetzy god that was one of the worst things ever
[5:25:20] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV Vashj'ir was a great zone, but ppl under valued it cus it took longer than Mount Hyjal
[5:25:23] WillowJane: sick mog
[5:25:28] Gabe4D: but it was SO cool
[5:25:34] Milanesa_De_Pollo: retail monkaS
[5:25:43] ChillyHTX: if only you had ashbringer
[5:25:44] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV They should have made the Seahorses usable in other zones
[5:25:47] Gabe4D: like a ridable water mount
[5:25:50] Gabe4D: anywhere in water
[5:25:51] sigilfish: epic
[5:25:53] lagginginironforge: The pump SOO much money in dragonflight but classic gets nothing. Its so strange.
[5:25:56] tsetse2fly: WOOOOO DRAGON RIDING
[5:25:58] Mattysaiyan: Don't you have corrupted ashbringer as a warlock? It's bis mog
[5:26:05] andypandynz: @lagginginironforge retail makes way more
[5:26:07] way_back: retail is sick
[5:26:08] romierome31: true
[5:26:11] eshonxv: v true
[5:26:17] Nytsongx: true
[5:26:18] lagginginironforge: @andypandynz Does it? Isn't classic much bigger?
[5:26:18] Doribob1: whatever you say, boomer
[5:26:19] kheap_: i play retail and i agree
[5:26:19] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: makes it so you see noone lol
[5:26:24] carlos_dang3r: flying was probably #1 WoW killer
[5:26:25] andypandynz: @lagginginironforge no lol
[5:26:25] WillowJane: but if they didnt i wouldnt have gotten invincible this week Sadge
[5:26:28] Mattysaiyan: Even the devs agree with that
[5:26:30] helpdogsonmyleg: why
[5:26:30] dibadibb: is this Spyro? PogU
[5:26:32] numblezzz: the speed is the worst part. shrinks the world
[5:26:35] amarv: need tunneling mounts
[5:26:48] Veldigodt: Why did Asmongold quite retail wow?
[5:26:53] eshonxv: it one of those things that sounds cool, but anyone with 2 brain cells can realise why its fkn terrible
[5:26:54] Veldigodt: he have everything almost unlocked lol
[5:26:56] lagginginironforge: @andypandynz but all of twitch is dominated by classic streams if thats a representation of the population at all
[5:26:57] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: @Veldigodt ... brother
[5:27:02] plasmatwice: Bro I checked your accounts, and I'll be brief, but you're clearly BASED so you earned a follow
[5:27:02] Veldigodt: What?
[5:27:05] itsquetzy: AGREED
[5:27:08] windatar: It should have stayed in TBC.
[5:27:16] andypandynz: thats why they make the world interactive, flying makes no diff this take makes no sense, every expansion laucnhes with no flying and its still ass
[5:27:19] Veldigodt: @CarefulWithThatAxeEugene What? Asmongold
[5:27:22] WillowJane: @Veldigodt idk maybe go ask him
[5:27:24] Veldigodt: did quite retail wow
[5:27:30] Mattysaiyan: Going A to B is not engaging with any of the content with a flying mount, it's nice QoL but it's bad for the game
[5:27:32] numblezzz: it took me so long to get used to walking across zones again in classic. reminded me why i love the zones so much
[5:27:32] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: with flying mounts they also have to make insanely huge maps
[5:27:38] andypandynz: @lagginginironforge its not in the slightest
[5:27:38] batmern_: @Veldigodt i remember him saying there was way too much shit to do and he just felt overwhelmed and always behind the pack
[5:27:41] Veldigodt: @StaysafeTV Why did ASMONGOLD quite wow ?
[5:27:44] kheap_: no more asking people for portals
[5:27:47] Veldigodt: kk
[5:27:49] SONII: hey bro did you quit SoD?
[5:27:54] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: @Veldigodt why you asking in here lol, asmons only said it 90 times
[5:27:55] SONII: why are you on retail?
[5:27:55] WillowJane: KEKW
[5:27:57] plasmatwice: We live in quite a world, eh? Nice that we have WoW atleast.
[5:28:02] Snaketrap: YEP
[5:28:03] Mattysaiyan: @SONII KEKL

[5:29:40] Mattysaiyan: @numblezzz and yet I still have 5 bag spaces because of the amount of junk they make me hoard
[5:29:43] DankWizard420: @plasmatwice wouldnt go that far jesus
