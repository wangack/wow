[1:59:18] HeyImArty: this is something I dont see discussed alot, you obvs have music on for stream content, but isnt it objectively better to play without music & ingame sounds on
[1:59:29] Urpalmax: have you guys queued into laynerz sp mage? or do they not queue this early?
[1:59:55] suppilein: @HeyImArty you realize pojke plays for so long he is the ingame sounds?

[2:32:59] chinchin23: if you ret arua can it poke out rogue? or is there a trick with it
[2:33:03] testestkappa: rogue is not viable in wrath
[2:33:09] damndanielsctv: It must be exhausting to feel a bit forced to change the playstyle you know works. Not to mention, knowing how your partner rants on pretty much everything if it's not going his way in regards to the playstyle he wants to play, which feels opposite to yours. And not using voice does not really help in making progress as partners. Seem to be the reasoning for some of the recent losses no?
