[0:04:26] Topher_IRL: Start and take the key out
[0:04:31] Spyke_ZGZ: "Hey you SHOULD check the engine, but I'm a Mazda3 so let's fucking go"
[0:04:35] Topher_IRL: And she didn't fuckin care
[0:04:36] Topher_IRL: LUL

[0:13:27] Topher_IRL: It might be questionable to the ToS idk
[0:13:43] Topher_IRL: It's like Fight Club
[0:14:23] LumberChopMan: I recorded 30+ mage bots in elwynn this morning, the ToS is a lie
[0:14:36] LumberChopMan: well recorded like10, reported 30
[0:14:53] Topher_IRL: Dude they were baaaaad in Westfall weeks ago
[0:15:09] LumberChopMan: I feel like they could sample pathing of players for some number of initial levels to detect it.
[0:15:10] Topher_IRL: Also the ones running from Stocks to the vendor and back
[0:15:15] Topher_IRL: Like a fuckin army marching
[0:15:18] LumberChopMan: but I digress, good morning!
[0:15:25] Topher_IRL: LUL morning!
[0:15:31] snipez_zgz: good morning
[0:15:58] LumberChopMan: I felt like an idiot because initially running by I was throwing out my little priest buff and renews and shit... then the realization set in lol
[0:16:10] Summy_211: AGAIN?
[0:16:15] snipez_zgz: musta been a wet dream
[0:16:16] Topher_IRL: Yeah I def accidentally put Arcane Intellect on a few before I noticed
[0:16:23] Summy_211: Eating?
[0:16:29] Summy_211: okay okay
[0:16:36] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: LUL
[0:16:37] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: wtf
[0:16:42] Topher_IRL: Did I tell you I had a dream several weeks ago, the night after Amanda showed that giant bell pepper on stream?
[0:16:44] Summy_211: Oh shit okay
[0:16:49] Topher_IRL: I dreamed I was shopping for bell peppers for like 2 hours
[0:16:50] Topher_IRL: LUL
[0:16:55] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL LUL LUL LUL
[0:17:23] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: lol you maniac
[0:17:59] Summy_211: Soccer was the weird part? not me in your dreams?
[0:18:00] Summy_211: cute
[0:18:18] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: the tamales will set you free @Summy_211
[0:18:23] Summy_211: @AmandaMarie_ZGZ AMEN
[0:18:34] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: LUL
[0:19:46] snipez_zgz: did u sell that mining enchant last night? or u get rekt by the overnight drop in price
[0:20:02] Topher_IRL: It devalues gold accumulation from the greys and shit a TON
[0:20:20] snipez_zgz: i just picked it up for 50g
[0:20:26] reborndevil96: good morning ya stud
[0:20:49] snipez_zgz: was hoping u got more for it
[0:20:56] Spyke_ZGZ: FUCK
[0:21:06] Spyke_ZGZ: Spending my Sunday helping my dad with his fucking truck
[0:21:10] Spyke_ZGZ: I don't even like working on my OWN car
[0:21:36] LumberChopMan: it mostly makes me angry because I am of the opinion that it is a problem that is for the most part (enough to have significant impact) solvable. A very naive behavior model could detect the mass amounts that I can as I run by them.
[0:22:22] LumberChopMan: Only thing that makes any sense is that the problem is way worse then I perceive and they are undetectable or less detectable in most cases
[0:22:31] LumberChopMan: just test how players turn
[0:22:48] LumberChopMan: how many players hit the same point over 24-hours that isnt part of a expected set like fly poitns of banks
[0:22:51] LumberChopMan: so many options
[0:22:54] Topher_IRL: Can I also submit a claim that whoever set up the Mages early in SoD had no fuckin idea what they were doing
[0:22:58] Topher_IRL: They were really bad at Mage
[0:23:02] Topher_IRL: LUL LUL
[0:24:01] LumberChopMan: same, economy in MMO's is a huge draw for me and when I am fighting an unfair fight its boooo
[0:24:05] Topher_IRL: What are you gonna get? A ring, or maybe the ring?
[0:24:09] StreamElements: Link to my YouTube Page, HIT THAT SUB BUTTON!! - https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeegersTV
[0:24:31] Topher_IRL: The bracers?
[0:24:31] LumberChopMan: but they do ban many that I report so, I guess I should thank them for doing SOMETHING (or saying they do something)
[0:24:45] Convoak: Heard you're dreaming about other people
[0:24:48] Topher_IRL: Yeah and another one for the next 2 level bands too
[0:24:57] Convoak: That's not what I heard
[0:24:57] Topher_IRL: Warsong is long term commitment for sure
[0:25:34] LumberChopMan: Orderdominos

The fight also vaulted Mayweather past $1 billion in total earnings.
[2:05:38] SavedEight_ZGZ: 275m lol that 1.3 football aint shit
[2:06:48] SavedEight_ZGZ: figthers have always been paid pretty well, but he's in another game

[3:48:34] SavedEight_ZGZ: "HELLDIVERS™ 2 is a 3rd person squad-based shooter that sees the elite forces of the Helldivers battling to win an intergalactic struggle to rid the galaxy of the rising alien threats. From a 3rd person perspective, players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats. 1/2
[3:48:38] SavedEight_ZGZ: Players can also aim down the sights for a more accurate 1st person camera view. Combat is accompanied by frequent sprays of blood and dismemberment as players exterminate the alien forces or players and squad mates are hit by environmental explosions or friendly fire. Enemy encampments and battlefield environments depict bloodstains and dismembered corpses. 2/2
[3:48:38] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: just a slow  gather
[3:48:40] Spyke_ZGZ: Unintentional PvP. KEKW
[3:48:45] SavedEight_ZGZ: all of that sounds so fucking perfect lol
[3:48:56] Spectre_1019: MaxLOL
[3:49:02] SavedEight_ZGZ: and what really got me was the first review i saw: "Worked so hard to save Super-Earth, only to be napalm striked by my team mates. For Democracy!"
[3:49:40] Spyke_ZGZ: I think it's matchmaking.
[3:49:41] Spectre_1019: You can cater to public or only friends.
[3:49:59] Spyke_ZGZ: Pick a mission and it finds a party kind of thing
[3:50:05] Spectre_1019: There's a max of 4 players per mission so it's not super MMO.
[3:50:09] StreamElements: We're LIVE on Kick! ---> https://kick.com/zeegers/
[3:50:18] SavedEight_ZGZ: Helldivers 2 is a third-person shooter that emphasizes co-op play. It allows up to four players to jump into a hostile environment and complete objectives while battling large armies of enemies. Once those objectives are completed, players must call in an extraction and survive a final wave of enemy attacks until the dropship arrives. From there, players will be able to acquire various ability and gear upgrades as well as swap elements of their current loadouts.
[3:50:27] Spectre_1019: The harder difficulties have harder bosses.
[3:51:22] Spyke_ZGZ: Kinda like CoD Zombies... struggling to compare it to something older.
[3:51:35] Spectre_1019: Base game is $40 USD. The bonus pack is $20. Not much use in the bonus pack but a shiny cape and a beginner level gun.
[3:51:35] Spyke_ZGZ: But you progress outside of the map
[3:51:36] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: whats this cozy sleeping bag?
[3:51:56] Spyke_ZGZ: @Spectre_1019 Dark and Darker players stopped reading at "shiny cape"
[3:51:57] SavedEight_ZGZ: the game steam compared it to for me was "World War Z" but i feel thats a bit of a stretch haha @Spyke_ZGZ
[3:52:24] Spyke_ZGZ: @SavedEight_ZGZ That's fine. Palworld is like TF2 according to Steam.

[6:02:26] SavedEight_ZGZ: I started working my freshman year of HS. Luckily had some connections in the school so I was able to get a job at my HS right after school as a Swim Instructor. Taught kids 3-5 how to swim. I mainly did the first two phases which was getting them used to being in the water and submerging + blowing bubbles lol
[6:02:49] SavedEight_ZGZ: actually paid me pretty decent for being a freshman. 14/hr starting.
[6:03:16] SavedEight_ZGZ: part time, 30-32 hours a week but still. i wasnt complaining.
[6:04:08] LumberChopMan: @SavedEight_ZGZ thats not bad at all, I think i was getting 6.75/hr when I was 16
[6:04:13] SavedEight_ZGZ: i remember a mom came in with her son, dressed to swim as well. she was like "Yall charge way to much for one person, im gonna learn something too" and manage was like "fuck it" lol
