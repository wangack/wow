[0:16:34] verii: @FreddyFerrera prob druid most
[0:16:43] verii: @FreddyFerrera maybe shaman leasty
[0:17:01] FoxiekittenWoW: druids are very good in damp what?
[0:17:07] FreddyFerrera: Oh, I thought sham would be like in the middle
[0:17:09] biofreaks: Dew playing Holy Priest?!? He must know something is on the horizon ?>!?!

[0:18:35] FoxiekittenWoW: i guess
[0:18:44] verii: @FreddyFerrera yeah but they just have weak healing so its hard for them to catchup
[0:18:49] FoxiekittenWoW: pretty sure druid is considered the best healer in high damp
[0:18:59] FoxiekittenWoW: dno which is the worst
[0:19:04] FreddyFerrera: @verii yeah true
[0:19:06] verii: idk shaman seems better
