[0:29:18] Yvernaa: I love when people complain on reddit, I want more of that, please don't nerf Starsurge yet
[0:29:19] MrAdams26: Also can we talk about how the paladin pvp weapons are uncontested the best looking
[0:29:27] SunTruth1: @MrAdams26 they are so fking insane
[0:29:29] Krozac22: EVERY class is so strong right now starsurge is fine. Warrior is the only one that isnt up to par
[0:29:38] ashtaroxx: plink agreege
[0:29:40] eskilator_gl: Shaman totem is better ngl
[0:29:40] SunTruth1: @MrAdams26 Compare the warrior weapons to paladin weapons ICANT

[0:51:58] ronniie3003: 1min debuff is like 2 mins long cause of lag @Guzu
[0:52:02] GHOST97915: YEEES

[0:52:24] Felgot: flying starsurge :D
[0:52:32] flowerpew: @guzu right now what happens is people camp 40 yds away from graveyard and kill people whose debuff has just run out, the spawns need to be randomized a bit
[0:52:32] Smooo07: hmjj
[0:52:34] Chimiaro: Still not level 40!?

[0:55:57] wisenot: its clearly is exploit by definition
[0:55:58] DJspookyghost: everyone just assumed that's how the event was gonna work Shruge
[0:55:59] mrFAZZO: "clever" lol, they just camped them
[0:56:03] Lenovitch: its not even hard to get your epic stv wep, just takes like 4-6 events, so calm down everyone
[0:56:06] nemzky: people have been camping GYs in PVP for literally years, but now its an "explot"
[0:56:08] MrAarickan: agreed
[0:56:08] Maxims5Head: POIG
[0:56:12] mandl: Im not sure about this guy and his videos. He is always complaining that much that it seems like he is a reaincarnation of the classic forums.
[0:56:13] mlady_telegramz97: an exploit means abusing game mechanics or bugs
[0:56:15] Arthident: wouldnt say it is an exploit either.. but still.. no surprise that this event turned into a complete clown show where many dont enjoy
[0:56:15] Pop_Sloth: People have camped graveyards in BGS for forever
[0:56:15] Tobloo: It's Blizzards last word what is clever and what is not
[0:56:15] Vertigo_GB: Ban the hunters ... they are OP and farming too much ... EXPLOIT
[0:56:16] sparxies: yeah thats bad design
[0:56:16] darkpwnz: thats why i use flyhack coz its in the game and im using it :)
[0:56:19] Colddaylight: ITS NOT CLEVER.. Its how people kill the whole event.. and then wind up crying nobody does STV anymorew
[0:56:21] Mr_Moffert: its how they designed the event, they then saw it didnt work and changed it
[0:56:25] mrFAZZO: The devs are to blame
[0:56:29] MrAdams26: LOL
[0:56:32] mlady_telegramz97: OM
[0:56:32] trlme: a fly hack isnt in the game lol
[0:56:34] Smooo07: 3rd party program
[0:56:36] mothwhowearslippers: "bug" is game mechanic too but when fixed bugged mechanics deleted. it is unfair
[0:56:38] Karntar: Usually don't disagree but a clever use of game mechanics is literally an exploit.
[0:56:38] DaTh_Champ: its not meant to be done after 1 event
[0:56:41] neuroxin: there was nothing to indicate that the existing mechanics were not intended by the developers.
[0:56:43] flowerpew: no I'm just pressing a button in one program and it makes fly in another program HACKERMANS
[0:56:43] BlueGrizzliBear: How unclever is it to develop an event without having thought of this ?
[0:56:45] Horfent: People being salty 󠀀
[0:56:45] wisenot: thats a hack not a exploit
[0:56:46] Mr_Cobblepot: NODDERS
[0:56:46] jonquicks_: no exploit just blizzard being absolutely clueless like usual @guzu
[0:56:48] ooTHExTUBEoo: om
[0:56:49] PieceOfPanic: Fly is not an exploit, that's a hack.
[0:56:53] nemzky: log out skipping
[0:56:54] MrAdams26: brb flyhacking back to SW
[0:56:56] xelm_: just playing the game lol
[0:57:05] resume___: exploit is something the game allows you to do, but its not intentional. hacking is using cheats.
[0:57:06] trlme: They just understood the mechanic better then the ones who implementet it u cant punish ppl for it
[0:57:08] LabyrinthMW: Nah defo exploiting gg you're getting banned my uncle works at blizzard

[0:57:12] TinySp00k: Guzu is a Exploiter D:
[0:57:14] PaddiV: so... glitching is clever use of mechanic ?^^
[0:57:16] neuroxin: they were literally just playing the game as it was built
[0:57:17] mlady_telegramz97: flyhacking is messing with the coding of the game itself
[0:57:20] mlady_telegramz97: so its a hack

[0:57:29] reaspzz: warrior gameplay
[0:57:33] Jellooze: exploits shouldnt be something you can just accidentally do
[0:57:39] PieceOfPanic: Exploit is abusing a flaw in the system by definition @Guzu
[0:57:40] wisenot: just because its common doesnt mean its not an exploit
[0:57:46] StreamElements: H1manu just tipped $3.00 PogChamp
[0:57:54] flowerpew: your honor, it was a clever use of irl mechanics not credit card fraud EZ
[0:57:57] Foodlebar: Shruge i mean if it wasnt an exploit, they wouldnt have fixed it
[0:58:03] Gandimir: its not even a big problem. you easily get 300-400 coins right now and the epics cost 1000. ppl are dramatic af
[0:58:15] MrAdams26: xdd
[0:58:16] mlady_telegramz97: yeah make respawn points random and were good
