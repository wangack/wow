[3:49:58] TheUnknowing: Maybe has something to do with keeping things normal or keeping things as they should be, like in a pattern
[3:50:03] S1appadabass: BELLULAR WHERE ARE YOU?!
[3:50:09] Alaquane: They're looking for the sweet spot of other game content drought, lawsuit hell, and unsubs

[4:03:21] xhale2nhale: @luckfore so because he decided to play another game= he quit?
[4:03:23] Zorikune: I'm doing what I can on Chromie Time for you =)
[4:03:28] S1appadabass: Blizzard needs to Tarantino an expansion, give us the end right off the bat then fill us in as we go
[4:03:54] Aidler: people just have "end-of-story-phobia"
[4:03:59] PvtHudson093: So Bellular videos
[4:04:07] OnysabletX: olo
[4:04:34] Bayne77: this will change everything vids Kappa
[4:04:45] theDirtyon3: LUL
[4:04:51] xhale2nhale: people just can't figure out the story/ending whihc probably got them frustrated
[4:04:57] xhale2nhale: which*
[4:05:02] SirVoro: That would be hilarious
[4:05:05] CrusaderNero: actually
[4:05:07] CrusaderNero: that would be cool
[4:05:12] thiccsushi: I gave up trying to understand this storyline and stopped caring
[4:05:18] theDirtyon3: i love it tbh
[4:05:28] infandous90: I just hit 60. Think I can catch up before 9.2? I hear catch-up is terrible this expansion
[4:05:31] CrusaderNero: no wonder ppl dont understand, its a utter mess
[4:05:38] Rudric_Ice: shadowlands story is /spit
[4:05:41] luckfore: i think also because views are way down atm
[4:05:48] Thoreya: what views
[4:05:57] pacificmc1: The story is not a mess. It's just shit
[4:05:57] theDirtyon3: they dont want to understand
[4:06:02] Shrenko: @infandous90 ofc you can, there is nothing really to catch up on for 9.2 other than story I guess?
[4:06:20] Shrenko: I got server first for this mount PogChamp
[4:06:21] Thoreya: i personally think a lotta people just like to shit on wows story
[4:06:25] Zorikune: One thing I love about Chromie Time is that I can do into Dire Maul for world buffs if I want extra crit and 15% stamina =)
[4:06:28] Thoreya: its not the best but
[4:06:28] jeffnsteff2019: if there was a true ending game would shutdown and wow would die on other side of coin fantasy's never have true ending its on story or adventue after a other
[4:06:32] Moronil: maybe they need to find a way to better tell a story in game, the story is not bad at all
[4:06:34] audrock7: yeah its pretty straightforward whether people like it or not
[4:06:42] cbiskit89: too many retcons and information outside the game to care about it. it's not confusing it just comes across and sloppy
[4:06:45] akia03: @infandous90 just condiuts and renown really
[4:06:46] xhale2nhale: I guess it's not the story ppl want it to be, I mean not everyone will get the story their mind as constructed
[4:06:52] cbiskit89: as sloppy*
[4:07:00] xhale2nhale: has*
[4:07:02] Shrenko: how the story is told I guess
[4:07:08] S1appadabass: I think people thought Sargeras was the big end baddy, then jailer out of nowhere, i guess
[4:07:10] PvtHudson093: it just dosnt make sense to me
[4:07:12] MFKnightS: isnt she tho ;-P
[4:07:14] OnysabletX: i dont think a lot of people have a thing to be mad at, they just joi the noise of others
[4:07:16] Bayne77: yes.  shes.... UNdead Kappa
[4:07:24] jeffnsteff2019: only 10 percent care about lore and rest community are more QOL/mechs
[4:07:26] akia03: why didnt they get this mad about jaina?
[4:07:31] Zorikune: Huolon is up WM off
[4:07:33] CrusaderNero: to be fair, the jailer has no buildup
[4:07:33] Rudric_Ice: more RETCON POOGERS
[4:07:50] MFKnightS: they may contiune his story
[4:07:58] OnysabletX: Chat dumb question. have they shown us anything of what happened to arthas after being cast into the maw?
[4:07:58] jeffnsteff2019: that would have ruin fun and surprise for fanbase
[4:08:00] CrusaderNero: hes new and now he dies :)
[4:08:05] MrGattz: people. people are the problem here
[4:08:15] LegoCoin: Jailer = Marty Mcfly
[4:08:32] pacificmc1: Surprises are good if they make sense
[4:08:35] S1appadabass: Shadowlands has been in the game before too
[4:08:58] hikaritd: Jailer did everything. He retconned the retcon too, SeemsGood
[4:08:58] cbiskit89: towelliee likes star wars episode 9 confirmed
[4:08:58] happybooger: i like this storyline more than WoDs
[4:09:03] sadgeski: Nah... it sells short all the story building they did for other characters. I still don't consider the jailer a badass, they're just writing things in to 'prove he is a badass'.

[4:09:27] PvtHudson093: Its like watching Ironman and then skipping straight to watching Infinity War, you wouldnt know who Thanos is or why he was trying to get the infinity stones.
[4:09:31] SirVoro: I wont judge the story until its completed. No reason to judge something thats not complete yet
[4:09:47] jeffnsteff2019: shadowlands legion and WOTLK are some best stories and lore i have seen in mmo's
[4:09:49] cipusanx: the story is shit. they had to touch old stories like sargeras and the burning legion, sylvanas having less agency since her transformation into banshee. it can be said so much about the story in shadowlands.
[4:09:59] sadgeski: He lame
[4:10:03] pacificmc1: We don't know his motivations though. He wants to unmake reality, ok but why
[4:10:05] Thoreya: wows story is just too big to fit in expansion cycles
[4:10:06] trevt6: why is the jailer doing what hes doing?
[4:10:09] Thoreya: honestly thats what it is
[4:10:09] chopsaki: what's his purpose?
[4:10:13] MFKnightS: his story might just be starting
[4:10:13] hikaritd: WHY does he want to rewrite reality. Thats what I want to know
[4:10:15] chopsaki: do 'evil' shit
[4:10:15] sadgeski: yep
[4:10:18] Bayne77: i want to know if his mom hit him when he was a kid
[4:10:20] PvtHudson093: Foe him to cover his nipples up
[4:10:22] charizard_main: Yes
[4:10:24] wezhetique: thaaaaank you!!!! I think people have too many expactations

[4:10:43] sadgeski: what if khadgar is the jailer
[4:10:46] pacificmc1: KEKW
[4:10:50] Zorikune: I don't know if you got my whisper on WM off Huolon =)
[4:10:51] chopsaki: pssst.. you want another sylvanas expansion.. cause that's how you got another sylvanas expansion
[4:10:58] akia03: oh you didnt see the story leaks for after the raid
[4:10:59] Zettabyte: The Jailer and Sylvanas gets married and lives happily ever after, @Towelliee Kappa
[4:11:04] TheUnknowing: legion aff was so fun
[4:11:04] smashwow: i think the T&E video covers a lot of the concerns
[4:11:08] pacificmc1: hey at least the sylvanas book might be good as it's written by christie golden
[4:11:15] pacificmc1: not danuser
[4:11:19] Zorikune: still alive
[4:11:30] S1appadabass: I'm telling you, people are salty because they thought the story of wow revolved around Sargeras being the big bad
[4:11:46] pacificmc1: Alex Afrasiaba left in Legion didn't he?
[4:11:47] thiccsushi: WoW community always needs a fall guy
[4:12:16] cipusanx: say that to pyromancer
[4:12:31] cbiskit89: jailer feels a lot of christoph waltz's blofeld in spectre. after building up quantum, the writers come in at the last minute with spectre/jailer was behind it all and it just feels unearned to everything you see up to that point
[4:12:42] commanderfaceless: just as the dutchman must always have a captain, there must always be a scapegoat
[4:12:47] Rudric_Ice: 10.0 will be steve's baby LUL we are doomed
[4:13:18] trevt6: sylvanas going "i will not serve" was unforgivably bad writing, when shes been doing that for 4 years...
[4:13:30] smashwow: @Rudi_Ice agreed. anyone that liked Season 8 of GoT as a story telling method is big oooooof
[4:13:35] PvtHudson093: Oh Nyoo
[4:13:52] pacificmc1: Steven Danuser liked GOT s8, says it all really

[4:22:09] ithinkmynameisjordan: honestly its boring I played the beta. Its like farming creeps in league and fighting baron. but the entire game. pvp will probably be fun.
[4:22:10] pacificmc1: classic is fun for the leveling
[4:22:14] jkitchin75: do you have to buy it then its free to play?
[4:22:15] CrusaderNero: @txrb were am I hating on the game? Thats what most ppl will do LUL as with any game

[4:33:56] Lycis: WoW has no charismatic Emet Selch
[4:33:57] pacificmc1: @Halgrender lets hope they dont touch arthas instead, they will just ruin him
[4:34:11] teerwik: the jailer is a dominatrix
[4:34:29] Lycis: Nahhhh 4Head
[4:34:39] Nehcrom: Now I leave.
[4:34:41] Thoreya: best bfa music
[4:34:48] pacificmc1: yeah that music is nice
[4:35:00] Shrenko: D:
[4:35:03] CrusaderNero: soo good music
[4:35:06] theDirtyon3: just wait this is galaxy brain shit
[4:35:29] Shrenko: rigged
[4:35:49] Lycis: LUL
[4:36:16] 3663Sharad: So its math
[4:36:31] Alaquane: ouch, 7,000 people bankrupted
[4:36:34] cbiskit89: predict all outcomes and you'll have to be right LUL
[4:36:39] Wildside1177: He tried all the combos.
[4:36:51] Lycis: kind of pyramid scheme
[4:37:18] PvtHudson093: Its like jumping as a Blood Elf and getting 10 flips in a row
[4:37:19] Lycis: LUL
[4:37:52] xhale2nhale: @PvtHudson093 I think you mean Nelf female
[4:38:26] xhale2nhale: but yea
[4:38:38] PvtHudson093: @xhale2nhale twirl flip same thing
[4:38:46] xhale2nhale: yup
[4:38:46] Pralyth: so he's a grade A BS'r
[4:38:55] theDirtyon3: 200IQ
[4:38:59] Lycis: Good summary of WoW story haha..leads to absolutely nothing
[4:39:02] Lycis: LUL
[4:39:21] Wildside1177: The problem with this argument is that you can make it about anything requiring a series of events. It is post-modernism.
[4:39:35] xhale2nhale: so he's basically bullshtting until something pulls off

[4:39:47] BoogieDuck: Holy fuck I'm confused!
[4:40:05] cbiskit89: is there any actual evidence he darren brown'd this shit? he argument that jailer is just guessing doesn't feel backed up
[4:40:16] Lycis: LUL
[4:40:39] Wildside1177: @xhale2nhale You can look back at any series of decisions a person made and say it was all luck. It is not a good argument.
[4:40:54] RitzC: @cbiskit89 there is not lol, and thats the problem
[4:41:46] Lycis: yea its all by chance if you have an eternity to wait eventually this chance pulls off
[4:41:58] nielefs: damn he is on addies
[4:42:27] Lycis: hahaha

[4:45:58] allisonkielle: holy shit that makes so much sense
[4:46:09] AngelsMatt: @allisonkielle SARCASM?
[4:46:17] allisonkielle: no really
[4:46:17] theDirtyon3: @AngelsMatt not at all
[4:46:22] AngelsMatt: oh my
[4:46:33] LucasBaratao: gooodddd
[4:46:33] AngelsMatt: dude this make the jailer a worst villain
[4:46:36] Rudric_Ice: this feels like a bad soap opera
[4:46:38] xhale2nhale: try try n try again till something works
[4:47:04] RitzC: wait thats a good trait?
[4:47:05] Lycis: Just like Thanos dun dun dun
[4:47:15] banjlolz: so the jailer is just desperate and lucky?
[4:47:34] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:47:35] D3m0nHunt3r666: XD
[4:47:45] Lycis: hahaha
[4:47:53] Spaydex: @banjlolz trying something for 50000 years until it sticks aint really luck lul
[4:47:56] Volarin_: Interesting in theory
[4:48:02] Toon11: LUL
[4:48:05] PoisonCatalyst: the jailer is like all those dude perfect guys doing tricks shots that take 1000s of attempts but only show the one where the complete it
[4:48:06] flebbooo: Clap
[4:48:07] AngelsMatt: @Volarin_ not at all
[4:48:10] a23pk: Clap
[4:48:10] Q_TheDreamer: Clap
[4:48:14] RitzC: ya no this feels like a fanfic from Tali and not what Blizz actually intended lmao
[4:48:15] Wildside1177: @Spaydex Yeah that arguent holds no water
[4:48:15] theDirtyon3: Clap
[4:48:19] Baahumbug: Clap
[4:48:20] SirVoro: Clap
[4:48:31] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt maybe not you but maybe to that person
[4:48:31] chrslp: towClap
[4:48:33] charizard_main: Good vid
[4:48:35] theDirtyon3: @RitzC plz tell me what they intended
[4:48:36] a23pk: Cheerios oh baby
[4:48:38] Lycis: Cheerio
[4:48:49] TheUnknowing: its just like a blizzard story where some one else has to explain it for it to sound good or make sense
[4:48:52] klindatu: farming a mount for years and get it one day is the same thing. you need time but in the end you will get it and you only need it once
[4:48:56] Q_TheDreamer: TL;DR -- Death only has to win once.
[4:49:00] mrrazputin: Can we get a Jeiler nipple emot ?
[4:49:03] AngelsMatt: @xhale2nhale nah jailer is the worst villain in wow lore dude by far
[4:49:14] theDirtyon3: @TentaQles thank you for understanding and listening actually LUL
[4:49:20] RitzC: @theDirtyon3 thats the issue huh? Theyve done a terrible job at actually making that remotely known
[4:49:22] SirVoro: The characters really interesting the EXECUTION of the character is boring
[4:49:30] AngelsMatt: @Jasondelco true
[4:49:33] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt that's your opinion but others have their right to say if he's not
[4:49:43] akia03: bliz just wants 1 patch baddies these days
[4:49:46] Pralyth: wow writers only ever knew how to make mary sues, even when the writing was better
[4:49:52] commanderfaceless: death is eternal and only needs one lapse to win
[4:49:57] lalelusa: I like the IDEA of the Jailer
[4:49:58] theDirtyon3: he wants to like the jailor
[4:50:01] Attackroot: he had Doctor Strange use the time stone to see all the outcomes and went with the 1 thats working for now.. lol
[4:50:04] theDirtyon3: jailer*
[4:50:16] Rudric_Ice: TLDR- Jailer is the most boring ass mustache twirling villain ever
[4:50:30] Aidler: at least most of mop had nothing to do with this
[4:50:33] banjlolz: @Spaydex he was taking chances until something worked for him in order to start is plan, chances are based on luck
[4:50:35] TheRealAxiom: The Jailer is a kinda dumb namr tho
[4:50:41] brootalbemo: Wait, do you not have Huolon?
[4:50:42] AngelsMatt: @xhale2nhale there is no right here man,is a fact jailer could be the best villain in wow but not the writhers did a poorly job with him
[4:50:43] loxx8310: he is good. the way they present the story is just shitty tho, and this xpac feels rushed
[4:50:47] xhale2nhale: I just want to see what the Jailers endgame
[4:50:50] commanderfaceless: he has a solid story, but poor execution of said story @Towelliee
[4:51:11] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee We didnt get enough tease or hints before Shadowlands that Jailer is the bad guy
[4:51:11] cahoots82: Blizz needs better writers to convey the story.
[4:51:17] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt again you're open no need to try force it on me as idc
[4:51:21] kikabrenes: whats that percentage of rarity?
[4:51:23] Aro725: you got nalak towelliee??

[4:52:44] xhale2nhale: or zone

[4:53:33] TheUnknowing: jg beansworth? Kappa
[4:53:37] AngelsMatt: lets pray that 10.0 to actually be good because if not,dude idk 3 bad expac in sequence is too much
[4:53:57] OnysabletX: terron gregory is gonna amaze us with a cinematic, i can feel it
[4:53:58] flebbooo: Here is a pray for it being a CGI cinematic too
[4:54:01] Deodatus145: i think he wins
[4:54:07] Rudric_Ice: HOPIUM
[4:54:09] pacificmc1: Tbh I hate The Jailer, but I hope he won't die so he might one day actually become a decent villain
[4:54:20] AngelsMatt: there is a corpse of him datamined alredy
[4:54:20] xhale2nhale: yea i'm also hoping we lose just to see the outcome
[4:54:21] EscapePlan01: not more Maw please :<
[4:54:23] NickLeonhearth: We lose, servers go off and activision sells the IP Kappa
[4:54:25] loxx8310: i hope he wins and  we wont face him for a long while
[4:54:27] PokerFaceMoose: what will happen is we learn someone was manipulating the jailer to do all that the whole time
[4:54:28] OceanManCarter: I've been hoping that we lose an expansion since we went up against Argus
[4:54:30] Trignus: how long did it take us to get to LK  gonna be a bit b4 we get the jailer
[4:54:34] Pralyth: bolvar will become the next jailer if we win. There must always.. be... a Jailer
[4:54:41] cahoots82: *fade to black* Congratulations. You've beat the game. Would you like to start a New Game+?

[4:54:48] xhale2nhale: I mean we literally lost in Legion but homegirl revived us
[4:54:48] pacificmc1: He should win and just stay in the background for a few expansions, with some pieces and references to him
[4:54:57] xhale2nhale: Freya*
[4:55:03] pacificmc1: Build him up more until he unveils himself
[4:55:04] xhale2nhale: w/e her name was
[4:55:06] Aidler: I'd guess death can not die
[4:55:06] N3llee: what if we win but the cost of wining is so high that Azeroth is changed forever
[4:55:08] Rudric_Ice: blizzard letting a villain win ? KEKW
[4:55:15] mrrazputin: Towelliee " They cant make 30s cinematic" Blizzard - Hold my beer!
[4:55:29] Daganatv: Arthas will be the next Jailor. You get bet on that.
[4:55:30] pacificmc1: I still hope that N'zoth didn't die and Shadowlands is just a crazy nightmare by N'zoth :)
[4:55:37] SirVoro: No there wasnt one before they sent him there
[4:56:00] OnysabletX: if the 4 leaders have the 4 zones, but then imprisoned the jailer in the maw, what was his origonal zone?
[4:56:05] Trignus: hes up
[4:56:20] S1appadabass: Argus hitting the arbiter is what is sending everyone to the Maw i think
[4:56:31] cahoots82: G'luck with the mount farm bud. Have a good one.
[4:56:31] flebbooo: ngl haven't been this excited for an end off xpac cinematic. Last one was prolly Argus but even this i'm more excited for
[4:56:32] lalelusa: Just PLEASE Don't let the story end with "one of the First Ones crafted the Jailor specifically like that in order to recreate reality"
[4:56:36] xhale2nhale: maybe the Maw is what the Jailor vision while being imprison, maybe the Maw can be what the beholder vision it to be
[4:56:40] N3llee: @Towelliee what if we win but the cost of wining is so high that Azeroth is changed forever
[4:56:44] klindatu: he tortured the maw souls to build is army
[4:56:44] Phantomstrk: He wins, we lose and the aftermath is us going back to Azeroth brought back by the void where we return to “storm wind” as shown in that screenshot that was going around before shadowlands and then we get into a void and light expansion to align with someone to face off against jailer who probably dies in 10.1 but then rest of 10 is void be light.   Maybe.
[4:56:45] Qeevdo: yes
[4:56:48] OnysabletX: ohhhhhhh
[4:56:48] Alaquane: correct
[4:56:52] TheUnknowing: Yes, zovaal was the arbiter
[4:57:01] Aidler: oribos was his zone
[4:57:01] OnysabletX: gotcha, makes sense ty 4 clarifying
[4:57:03] Trignus: but what about nzoth  hes an older god
[4:57:04] longhauler4ever: @Towelliee i asked yesterday but what Mod are you using and also have you thought about getting your own line of E-juice?
[4:57:12] Galadeon: Yes
[4:57:26] AngelsMatt: the other thing that make really sad is what they did with the hell of domination
[4:57:42] QuigsTV: @towelliee whats your btag so I can help with huolon?
[4:58:05] PyleaTXinMA: !bnet
[4:58:05] Moobot: @PyleaTXinMA NA Btag | Towelliee#1402
[4:58:10] luckfore: they also said time goes by faster on SL
[4:58:17] flebbooo: we'll win but he def med an impact of sorts, like the sword
[4:58:22] QuigsTV: @PyleaTXinMA ty
[4:58:25] flebbooo: made*
[4:58:33] PyleaTXinMA: @quigstv yw
[4:58:36] AngelsMatt: the lore is so bad that make nobbel unsub to wow
[4:58:40] xhale2nhale: maybe the jailor leaves the SL and obtain a pantheon body or avatar n go to town on the world/universe
[4:58:42] OnysabletX: we have loose ends like wrathion searching for dragons, the nztoh dagger gal (forgot her name), and of course the light/void
[4:58:59] lalelusa: the Nightfae will put on a play for them as a story catch up
[4:59:42] Aidler: @lalelusa definitely
[4:59:48] TheUnknowing: Nzoth gonna be like 'Surprise mother fucker'
[4:59:48] Rudric_Ice: fuck void fuck light let us go to the other side of azeroth
[4:59:50] loxx8310: poor girl
[4:59:54] flebbooo: She certainly has KEKW
[4:59:56] gold9871: or its a dream
[4:59:57] Trignus: still has sword in her
[4:59:59] Bayne77: that bitch gonna be salty when she births
[5:00:00] PokerFaceMoose: well most other planets just die right
[5:00:00] Zorikune: Huolon is up WM on
[5:00:03] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt I mean he's just ona break, pretty sure he'll jump back in 9.2 and w/e then jump back out, nothing wrong with taking break from a game
[5:00:06] Xetter: Sounds like Eternals
[5:00:09] MrGattz: LUL
[5:00:19] Aidler: she had it rough
[5:00:20] lalelusa: BUT WHY? Why has she been through so much shit?1 Will we ever get to know?
[5:00:26] Phonola: got to love speculated fantasy
[5:00:33] CobblyWobbly: I got money on we go the 'hero' (all of our characters) go back to Azeroth since probably only one person can go back and it's a timeskip forward and we help Wrathion find the dragons
[5:00:42] AngelsMatt: @xhale2nhale he said earlier that he will comeback to 10.0 not 9.2 he is so pissed with jailer story
[5:00:54] CobblyWobbly: Which will then lead to the birth of Azeroth once we play how to train your dragon
[5:01:07] SirVoro: @dosetsu2 I think they originally intended us to go back and stuff be significantly different but then back peddled so we wouldnt have more weird time travel stuff
[5:01:17] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt ah I see, I didn't know since I never rally bother to follow what streamers or most folks do
[5:01:19] Daganatv: Someone bigger than the jailor is definitely trying to abort her.
[5:01:25] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[5:01:29] Aidler: 10.0 should be the birth of Azeroth
[5:01:41] commanderfaceless: he isnt play 8 d chess, hes playing 2d chess until he wins
[5:01:52] NickLeonhearth: 1 seconds has passed since we left azeroth
[5:01:54] SirVoro: Yeah it might still be a major plot point when we go back
[5:02:00] flebbooo: They really try to be super careful of what they can say about future things ever since wod with all the lost content promised
[5:02:00] r3crutr: They are winging it
[5:02:06] TheUnknowing: I mean for all we know we could be in the shadowlands for 2 years but it would be like 5 mins on azeroth
[5:02:06] loxx8310: dont worry ive just been to stormwind :)
[5:02:15] lalelusa: wouldn't the birth of the world soul destroy the planet? it  almost happened in The Eternals
[5:02:19] SirVoro: The planet dies if the world soul is born right?
[5:02:21] CobblyWobbly: If we go based off that one dude from Legion, he went in to the Shadowlands during Wrath, came back in Legion and for him it was minutes
[5:02:29] r3crutr: I dont think they really have figured the story out themself
[5:02:36] Throdio: They can move on and figure something else out
[5:02:36] AngelsMatt: @Towelliee jesse cox said one thing that i must agreed,wow is not about azeroth anymore is so focus in universe that the impact in azeroth seem empty in the current world
[5:02:38] xhale2nhale: what if Azeroth not what we really think she is, what if it's actually a evil world soul
[5:02:45] Daganatv: I hope we go back and it’s 30-50 years in the future.
[5:02:55] commanderfaceless: @Towelliee the jailer is playing 4 d chess, but hes playing it UNTIL he wins, not because he WILL win
[5:02:58] mario32: they r making a fallout tv show
[5:03:10] waltico90: good morning how are you happy Friday @Towelliee
[5:03:14] im_n0t_jezus: we all move to Draenor
[5:03:18] iVukan: but the title is bane of the jailer which implies he doesnt die, right ?
[5:03:19] xhale2nhale: Azeroth the Fallen eternal one
[5:03:27] AngelsMatt: @xhale2nhale its ok but nobbel is perhaps the most entusiast guy in wow lore dude and its sad to see what blizz did with him
[5:03:34] flebbooo: To the vindicar!
[5:03:37] Lucidtrix: could be
[5:03:42] Throdio: Ahh Hulon, I remmber using the knife toy to chop him up and freak people out
[5:03:53] commanderfaceless: @Towelliee the jailer is playing 4 d chess, but hes playing it UNTIL he wins, not because he WILL win first time
[5:03:54] SirVoro: I genuinely think we will have to deal with Tyrant Yrell and the others at some point
[5:04:01] holy_one: holy_one subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[5:04:03] TheUnknowing: we hade bane of the lich king title, and lich king died
[5:04:07] TheUnknowing: had*
[5:04:08] Aidler: it would definitely mix up things and leave enough opportunity for a interesting and fresh story
[5:04:10] OnysabletX: cypher pattern of rebirth/creation?
[5:04:32] AngelsMatt: the jailer story dude
[5:04:39] iVukan: guardian of the pattern i think
[5:05:02] commanderfaceless: @Towelliee the jailer is playing nest dimension chess, but hes playing it UNTIL he wins, not because he WILL win first time
[5:05:15] AngelsMatt: i see
[5:05:54] Breakthecause: Haters look at anything they can latch onto for an excuse to hate on Blizzard
[5:06:17] waltico90: you have a great time today farming mounts ?
[5:06:21] ttmaker: Really hope feb they gonna announce 10.0
[5:06:22] jeffnsteff2019: i love all content blizz makes
[5:06:24] lalelusa: I just want to know how it ends
[5:06:31] happybooger: @Towelliee and like you said, it is probably hard for him to make lore videos about story speculation
[5:06:32] AngelsMatt: @Breakthecause nah blizz really fucked up this time dude
[5:06:34] flebbooo: Kinda like how they datamined prior to the Argus cinematic that there was a wound in silithus
[5:06:39] jeffnsteff2019: besides mech and borrowed power
[5:06:44] r3crutr: You come back in azeroth and its the year 2004
[5:06:52] Bayne77: DayZ
[5:06:53] Breakthecause: @Breakthecause I politely disagree
[5:06:57] NickLeonhearth: you can usually se the cutscene waaaay before day 1
[5:07:00] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt plz explain
[5:07:01] Zorikune: Huolon up WM off
[5:07:15] flebbooo: fuck no i ain't killing no more boars and kobols KEKW
[5:07:26] AngelsMatt: @xhale2nhale explain what?
[5:07:31] OnysabletX: we go back to azeroth to see it taken over by gnolls and murlocs waging a faction war on eachother
[5:07:31] jeffnsteff2019: jailer is secertly bad guy from LOTR in disguise in wow universe
[5:07:32] xhale2nhale: every xpac I played ppl bitched n whine and this xpac is no difference
[5:07:37] commanderfaceless: @Towelliee the jailer is playing multi dimension chess, but hes playting UNTIL he wins, not because he WILL win first try
[5:07:45] rellik1311: @Towelliee which dps specs would you say are the best/more optimal right now? just came back after a 6 month break and kinda lost lol
[5:07:45] ttmaker: we arent gonna lose against jailer lol
[5:07:49] commanderfaceless: thats the last time im saying that
[5:07:56] xhale2nhale: @AngelsMatt nothing
[5:08:03] commanderfaceless: repeating is probably annoying some
[5:08:03] chrslp: Nothing can bring back the old feeling of leveling in Azeroth in true Classic and BC. I think it was more just experiencing such a one-of-a-kind game for the first time
[5:08:13] jeffnsteff2019: WowDevs are gonna throw a curve ball on us
[5:08:13] flebbooo: i'm holding on to that theory LULW
[5:08:16] TheUnknowing: i want azeroth to be all sorts of fucked up when we return
[5:08:22] flebbooo: it was all a dream
[5:08:25] CrusaderNero: well wow feels sleepy atm Kappa
[5:08:26] im_n0t_jezus: corruption but revamped not like in BFA
[5:08:28] ottalauss: god i hope corruptions come back
[5:08:35] ttmaker: @Towelliee when do you think they gonna reveal next expansion?
[5:08:45] Cabbageman007: Old school Horde vs is needed
[5:08:46] pitboss000: be really cool if they just ended WoW and make WoW2 where we start thousands of years later (upgraded everything)
[5:08:49] chrslp: WoW x Matrix? LUL
[5:08:49] AngelsMatt: @ttmaker after 9.2
[5:09:00] ttmaker: @AngelsMatt we need hype going !
[5:09:04] xhale2nhale: @chrslp to be fair we were all new and fresh but nothing will every recreate any first experience when it comes to games
[5:09:07] AngelsMatt: @pitboss000 wow 2 wont happen dude
[5:09:29] Aidler: for 10.0 to be a fresh start all stories have to somehow be finished an when do you start new if not with 10.0?
[5:09:37] chrslp: @xhale2nhale Exactly. Everyone is chasing that feeling but its like doing some hard drug. It'll never hit like it did the first time
[5:09:53] gravebanes1: so its like eonar in Antorus

[5:10:14] pitboss000: @pitboss000 I know it wont ever happen just be cool if it did
[5:10:31] ttmaker: I really like cosmic theme in WoW
[5:10:51] ttmaker: I don't know why the hate lol
[5:11:13] AngelsMatt: @ttmaker i will not buy 10.0 until i see if its good,blizz really do well hype things and i we see what its going to happen if 10.0 is the same thing as BFA and SL so i will keep my hype in control this time
[5:11:16] Breakthecause: @ttmaker because the foundation of WoW is classic fantasy and not cosmetic
[5:11:31] Breakthecause: Like Warcraft 1
[5:11:35] ttmaker: @Breakthecause back in wc3 we went to outland and first ever expansion was space
[5:12:02] chrslp: Years ago wasnt there some leak about an Emerald Dream expansion that never went anywhere?
[5:12:02] CrusaderNero: but what about them defias brotherhood
[5:12:06] ttmaker: Don't get me wrong I want fantasy in 10.0
[5:12:16] chrslp: I mean like BC/wotlk years ago
[5:12:18] CrusaderNero: D:
[5:12:22] AngelsMatt: the best story from warcraft universe is from w1 to w3
[5:12:38] CrusaderNero: what about them scarlet crusade

[5:13:30] CrusaderNero: yeah to be fair the jailer fapped about for milennials so enough time to have something work
[5:13:33] Breakthecause: I don't think it's bad to include cosmic type themes. I just want classic fantasy more than cosmic
[5:13:48] jeffnsteff2019: shadowlands reminded me of neverending story movie
[5:13:53] NickLeonhearth: I am confused, how is Huolon doing so much dmg, its just a rare
[5:14:08] chrslp: FeelsBadMan
[5:14:33] m3rk_zion: How did the Mythic Testing go yesterday, I forgot I had my own raid to attend, so I wasn't able to actually watch lol
[5:14:33] Broomba: he threw a bunch of theories about the lore and story on a wall
[5:14:34] jeffnsteff2019: because it pre nerf too toons
[5:14:34] ttmaker: Really hope 10.0 delivers like Legion did
[5:15:31] jeffnsteff2019: so SWTOR and lost ark both launch in FEB and NW has new stuff coming out too according PTR
[5:15:57] N3llee: I'm tired of being a Space Marine
[5:15:57] Shrenko: @moonshadows83 dont forget gw2 expansion
[5:15:58] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:15:58] CrusaderNero: man im also done with classic. its just old stuff at this point. played it enough
[5:16:00] bakurathewolf: did he get the mount?
[5:16:03] adi_thestarlight: Fk Classic
[5:16:07] m3rk_zion: What you don't want to Heal the WOUNDs again LUL
[5:16:08] TheUnknowing: if you want classic it does exist, you can play classic. WoW needs something new, we don't need to go back for retail.
[5:16:10] OnysabletX: classic is so boring
[5:16:23] Broomba: how many times can we all beat that dead horse in classic
[5:16:25] ttmaker: I hate classic
[5:16:31] CrusaderNero: theres no reason to create classic-like xpac. theres classic to play right now
[5:16:37] ParfumAmerican: why are u concern?
[5:16:37] adi_thestarlight: But boomers wont understand it
[5:16:39] Shrenko: @OnysabletX wow in general is right now
[5:16:55] N3llee: I'm tired of being a time traveling space marine.
[5:16:57] TheUnknowing: I like the grander scheme storylines
[5:16:58] AngelsMatt: if the jailer did what taliesin said in his video it would only make him a worse villain than he already is, for me there is no longer any salvation for this character, for me I would do the same as what the devs did in WoD, it didn't work right to and focus on another expansion and try to fix the shit and legion came which by the way is a decent expac
[5:17:00] ttmaker: Just make fun content and not many grindy systems and we get ourselves great expansion
[5:17:04] OnysabletX: @Shrenko at least ive got mounts and transmog collecting to pass the time :D
[5:17:11] ifirnja: draenor leveling was good though
[5:17:20] Aro725: I like wotlk, ver easy story to understand but awesome. And LK was a great villian
[5:17:25] CrusaderNero: WoD leveling was great
[5:17:39] Shrenko: @OnysabletX meh I gave up on that too :P I started playing other games and Im enjoying that alot
[5:17:40] Aidler: @towelliee and young players probably haven't had the old stories already multiple times
[5:17:43] Broomba: FF14 each expansion was different and had told the story in different ways
[5:17:44] soddalele: first draenor months were awesome
[5:17:47] justincb29: i didnt think shadowlands leveling was that bad tbh
[5:17:57] Throdio: Side quests can fulfill the classic style of story telling. Use them to flesh out the zones
[5:18:24] AngelsMatt: @justincb29 could be better
[5:18:38] jeffnsteff2019: SL and legion has some most intense lore and moments in my word i did tear and scream aat some points
[5:18:50] Zorikune: I had forgotten about the Book of the Ages item, free 93 Agility while on the Isle
[5:18:51] justincb29: @AngelsMatt  agreed
[5:18:57] Broomba: prefered MoP, Legion and BFA
[5:19:12] Phoxzy: Wow is an MMORPG and FFXIV is a RPGMMO
[5:19:13] OnysabletX: I enjoyed legion story telling the best.
[5:19:18] TheUnknowing: WoW is more focused on game play - ffxiv is based on story
[5:19:35] Broomba: FF14 is a different game
[5:19:36] ttmaker: I miss Legion Sadge
[5:19:57] AngelsMatt: @TheUnknowing not true combat in ff14 is great in his own way but i like wow more
[5:20:08] OnysabletX: when ysera died that was a moment
[5:20:30] TheUnknowing: @AngelsMatt Me saying that is not me saying ffxiv gameplay is bad, ive been playing ffxiv since 2.0 love it just as much as I do WoW, im just saying there is a main focus for each
[5:20:46] AngelsMatt: @TheUnknowing true
[5:21:13] my_feethurt: I got this mount first kill the day it came out
[5:21:16] luckfore: i wonder how many ppl with stick around if preach etc are done with the msq
[5:21:47] ttmaker: I didn't like FFXIV
[5:21:49] iasu_: ff for ppl tht can handle long gcd
[5:21:56] iseebs: I got the mount when it was current content. It dropped for me 3x in a row one day. I got it many times while farming Timeless rares back then. I was surprised the first time it DIDN'T drop.
[5:22:30] iVukan: i had huolon drop on my very first kill when i was 13 years old - somebody offered me 90k gold for it and i sold it cuz i had no gold at all and like a year ago i went and re-farmed it and it dropped after like 30 kills or so
[5:22:32] Broomba: you have to handle FF14 -- soo true @towelliee
[5:22:35] OnyxLair77: Any talk or news about Ashes that you can share?
[5:22:36] CrusaderNero: im never gonna play FF14. never even liked any FF game :O
[5:22:46] papaherc: do all the blue quests in ff, you will find so much content
[5:23:00] CrusaderNero: mcdonals of MMORPGs Kappa
[5:23:11] luckfore: monkaS
[5:23:12] AngelsMatt: true
[5:23:21] retro_justice: story arguably IS the experience
[5:23:25] Broomba: FF14 you have to be patience and be involved in the story and duty
[5:23:27] the__silent: i dont disagree with what u said right now but thats why u can make 2 characters one to lvl up fast and catch up with ur friends etc, and one for the story
[5:23:28] infantry10th: have you tried wow with controller?
[5:23:51] retro_justice: yoshi-p says it's less of an mmoRPG and more of an "MMO"
[5:23:52] Broomba: story time gated
[5:23:54] ijuki: ijuki subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! Keep up the content in 2022 SeemsGood
[5:24:03] saintsinning: im almost 300 hrs into ffxiv and still only at the end of SHB
[5:24:19] xhale2nhale: I tried FF but I quit after maybe level 10, it wasn't for me but FF Advent Child will still be my favorite FF movie, Cloud n Sephiroth is all
[5:24:30] retro_justice: that's great time haha
[5:24:44] AngelsMatt: @Broomba nop if skipped everything in 4 day you in level 90
[5:24:53] dranet11: that pala set looks so nice
[5:25:00] carboncoral: I started playing ffxiv in august and just finished shadowbringers yesterday. I'm so slow lol

[5:25:06] Broomba: @xhale2nhale -- it get betters when u hit level 15 and do your first dungeon - story picks up there
[5:25:36] xhale2nhale: @Broomba it might but i'll never know, no interest to try it
[5:25:40] NinjaChane: It's 100% true about FF14, my friends were max level and I rushed to get to the end with them and I quit right when I got close to the end of it, because I just didn't like that it was so story driven and appreciate the way WoW is in comparison.
[5:25:51] ttmaker: @Broomba got 30 and got bored
[5:26:00] grapyz: As long as your having fun, that what counts imo
[5:26:07] Broomba: @AngelsMatt - if u skip, then you are missing out, my opinion
[5:26:29] Broomba: @ttmaker then you dont have patience to immerse in the story and game at level 30
[5:26:32] jeffnsteff2019: so who do u think will grab worlds first zoval kill in 9.2
[5:26:38] AngelsMatt: @Broomba i know that i was just daying that is not story gaped
[5:26:48] dranet11: split runs affect like 300 people
[5:26:53] FryeZero: !oondasta
[5:26:53] Moobot: @FryeZero 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[5:27:01] CrusaderNero: thats like what, a couple of hundred ppl
[5:27:04] retro_justice: the biggest thing i was thinking about when i came back to WoW for a bit was.... why the hell doesn't WoW have old raids level synced like FF. timewalking ulduar really isn't the same
[5:27:19] AngelsMatt: yep next 2 week i will get my bis for the current savage raid
[5:27:20] xhale2nhale: @Broomba patience has nothing to do with for me it's just not my game
[5:27:20] retro_justice: i started during mists and always wanted to do old raids
[5:27:25] CrusaderNero: theres NO reason to spend alot of time with that stuff
[5:27:29] StalledStoner: That fact that they force you to play through so many hours of boring MSQs just to get to a point wheee people say or it’s so good tho! Not for me lol
[5:27:47] Broomba: @AngelsMatt for me it was -- takes me 3-6 hours just to progress in 1/10 of a new expansion
[5:28:12] Broomba: @xhale2nhale -- ok
[5:28:26] retro_justice: you have to play ff14's story like it's a single player RPG
[5:28:27] AngelsMatt: @StalledStoner u missing the point dude every mmo is like that
[5:28:30] jeffnsteff2019: faction loot should always be non prog and more cosmetic and QOL
[5:28:50] dranet11: @AngelsMatt that's just a lie
[5:29:21] infantry10th: What about ESO?
[5:29:32] Halgrender: Sim
[5:29:32] AngelsMatt: true
[5:29:45] jeffnsteff2019: I Love lore behind swtor your decisions impact your character
[5:29:45] retro_justice: the raids and trials are pretty fantastic and fun though
[5:30:08] Broomba: the raids and dungeons are good
[5:30:11] AngelsMatt: i just wish that wow has that
[5:30:21] smashwow: and yet the raids FF14 are good and not buggy @Towelliee
[5:30:52] retro_justice: again i hope Blizz adds a level sync for old raids
[5:31:09] jeffnsteff2019: are you could be more crazy and play ddo with is story with zone objectives and dungon diving for lvling
[5:31:13] retro_justice: saaaame
[5:31:19] smashwow: LOL
[5:31:27] dranet11: that would be scuffed as fuck with balancing
[5:31:32] Shrenko: how would they balance all the loot ?
[5:31:37] retro_justice: they'd have to balance it allllll though
[5:31:40] EscapePlan01: perm timewalking would be nice as well :s
[5:31:45] Melonbrew: what does that system do?
[5:31:47] N7Spectr3: Idk the loot system from FFXIV would be good to add as well.
[5:32:04] gabowabo182: how to obtain flying should also be copied from WoW
[5:32:07] Zorikune: I actually tried to do Karazhan using party sync which put all mobs at 60-63 for me. Made it to Attunmen and could not scratch his HP lol
[5:32:09] Dyren03: Personal loot is aids
[5:32:11] gabowabo182: errr from ffxiv
[5:32:18] benchmarkkgaming: master loot
[5:32:18] jeffnsteff2019: houses in wow wont happen since majority players though garrisons was make community more anti social and isolation
[5:32:22] AngelsMatt: the only thing that ffxiv could take from wow is mythic dungeon hard content for light groups
[5:32:33] gabowabo182: how to obtain flying should also be copied from Final Fantasy XIV
[5:32:43] retro_justice: i think WoW's gearing and building characters MAKES the game. ff14 doesn't really have builds
[5:32:51] AngelsMatt: @gabowabo182 its not the best way but could be a improvement
[5:32:53] cbiskit89: nah forget aether currents. just make me do the story quests for the zone then unlock flying as reward for last quest. forget the find and seek part
[5:32:55] retro_justice: trueeeee
[5:33:05] Mister___d: !vape
[5:33:08] Snixx94: Do you need think Blizzard will improve and take back the throne with future expansion?
[5:33:11] ShieldslamTV: oh man that would be a nightmare
[5:33:14] xhale2nhale: nothing wrong with the loot system except the whole not being able to trade cause of ilvl when the item is useless to ya
[5:33:23] Zorikune: It'd be like the World Bosses, I kill Doom Lord Kazzak on Chromie Time and the gear is ilvl32, so its just mog farming which is how it should be =)
[5:33:26] papaherc: you will do old content for valor points or some token like FF

[5:33:34] r0b928: Can you explain min ilvl no echo? What does that mean?
[5:33:36] azzurrin: there just straight lines
[5:33:38] jeffnsteff2019: lore fashion and housing is FFXIV true end game
[5:33:53] shale93: ff14 dungeons are meg
[5:33:56] shale93: meh*
[5:33:58] WhiteKnight74648: I wouldn't mind a heroic version of the dungeons in FF XIV
[5:34:07] AngelsMatt: @moonshadows83 is one of the endgame,savage and ultimate is solid in ff14 too just like in wow
[5:34:24] AngelsMatt: @r0b928 do the raid and trial close as day one
[5:34:28] cbiskit89: @r0b928 imagine being able to play a raid as if you were there during release at any time. that's min ilvl with no echo
[5:34:41] WhiteKnight74648: Probably a ARR dungeon
[5:34:45] AngelsMatt: true enviroment in wow is so much better
[5:34:45] jeffnsteff2019: i would love solo run dungeons for Wow like DDO has
[5:34:46] Alaquane: cutter's cry
[5:34:54] Alaquane: the only dungeon I can think of. with those ants
[5:34:59] roflpotamus: think hes even said it would never work
[5:35:08] Alaquane: you can go left or right on one of the circles to get to the sandhole
[5:35:18] Will_est: why are you in pandaria?
[5:35:22] Broomba: if its not broke, then why fix it
[5:35:24] TheUnknowing: spaghetti code
[5:35:30] Kisswani: also , trash in FFXIV dungeons doesn't have mechanics and doesn't rely on interrupts as much . CC just isn't the same
[5:35:44] DudeJoeyAwesome: he literally rebuilt the game from scratch
[5:35:45] AngelsMatt: @dosetsu2 let hopium just like 10.0 dude
[5:36:03] 위캔어퍼: when you think 9.2 will release?
[5:36:07] smashwow: i don't think M+ fits into FF14's model of gameplay. they definitely like the risk to reward ration to be balanced. M+ just doesn't fit that in it's current build.
[5:36:27] Alaquane: when can I crossplay wow on my playstation?
[5:36:39] Kisswani: tomes
[5:36:40] AngelsMatt: @dosetsu2 yeah but he said that they will come with a answers for the engine problem in the next live letter
[5:36:52] gabowabo182: ffxiv gearing reminds me of the WotLK days
[5:36:55] WhiteKnight74648: Crafting as an alternative to gearing
[5:36:58] azanarzx: @Alaquane addon console port
[5:37:03] naznarens: why would people want wow on playstation it sounds like sacrilege
[5:37:28] jeffnsteff2019: i miss concept of making gear sets get ur ready set go for dungeons and raid without reqs and sacrifing hrs and gold
[5:37:31] AngelsMatt: gear come from two side gear and tomestone in farm so there is two way to get yourt bis and you get in like 2 week in max
[5:37:39] blade_killa: i think they will remove it knowing them LUL
[5:37:42] 3663Sharad: Vault is a badluck protection
[5:38:17] AngelsMatt: @dosetsu2 hopium
[5:38:38] AngelsMatt: yeah craft is important to  raid until the next tier
[5:38:39] Kisswani: yeah , bought full crafted set today , around 2 mil gil at the moment on my server
[5:39:12] TheUnknowing: nah
[5:39:18] Alaquane: press mitigation button when red attack
[5:39:19] roflpotamus: just rotate cds
[5:39:21] WhiteKnight74648: I interupted once
[5:39:23] Alaquane: mostly brain off
[5:39:24] jeffnsteff2019: do you think its possible we mess up time since were in some form on cosmos and we come back altered azeroth with whole new dilemnas and lore
[5:39:25] AngelsMatt: mitgation dude,i hate when the tank died because of that
[5:39:38] Alaquane: dungeon tanking is very smooth brain
[5:39:39] LoneDoubleAgent: pretty much tank and dodge
[5:39:40] cbiskit89: go until you hit a doorway, let the dps aoe them down, repeat until boss, repeat until end of dungeons
[5:39:44] WhiteKnight74648: :)
[5:39:49] luckfore: cancelled by ff andies in 5..4..3..
[5:39:51] TheUnknowing: i play warrior in ffxiv, all the healers glare spam any ways so i gotta heal myself Kappa
[5:39:58] Aidler: don't care about the vault. it can stay. I used it maybe 2 or 3 times so far
[5:40:03] WhiteKnight74648: @luckfore nah. I main FF XIV and i agree with him

[5:41:24] maszi_on_the_beat: @Towelliee i agree because i watched you play ff and wow for so long that i feel your opinion is more than valid
[5:41:28] AngelsMatt: @azzurrin again two different game but i way say that tank raid in ff14 is more dinamic because of your personal responsability
[5:41:33] szble: True
[5:41:37] ElDrakenMan: woah is that a new light sign?! looks awesome
