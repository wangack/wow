[2:23:07] iamreallyafan: was drake and them playing?=
[2:23:09] Cyndren99: Kalvish is super skilled but the thing is he doesnt have the mentality of an og player - he wont stick around for long sadlly thats the case with the new tik tok generation, short attention span, he just doesnt have what it takes to be here for a long time. seen it over and over
[2:23:12] j_dawgz011: skyler  - u got evidence?
[2:23:17] pedroalmodovard: Lum not playing anymore ?

[2:24:27] TheMysticBean: @tic1993 he quit pve
[2:24:30] Jimmo_Q: what are your thoughts about current wow arena casters? Do you feel they are knowledgeable of the game enough so that they can correctly judge/analyze why teams/players are doing certain things or tactics? Or why then made the wrong call on that play etc.
[2:24:39] shailyyo: I think whaazz raiku and meeh were the best ever in wow
[2:24:40] manngard69: "even does pve " XDE such achievement wow
