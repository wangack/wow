[8:49:57] seksmuhchine: ur raid team ...
[8:50:00] doofeeneed: seeing 5 ferals at the top on fights is hilarious
[8:50:06] Its_Parker_Btw: fuck i miss Eric in
[8:50:10] seksmuhchine: lol
[8:50:14] camyo: alisoninaisle10 dont have to worry about filling and refilling the raid a hundred times just afk in front of a boss
[8:50:16] ari_sap: finally time for no comm arenas?

[8:50:58] Its_Parker_Btw: camyo is wow book
[8:50:58] seksmuhchine: banned from eho
[8:50:58] alisoninaisle10: @camyo ofc, ppl will always buy arena/raid carries/achieve carries but its usually not for gold in retail- ppl trying to break TOS with oog transactions
[8:51:14] MorrisonTH: 5 in pvp, i think like 7 to never miss a mage
[8:51:17] doofeeneed: its 5% for pvp
[8:51:20] alisoninaisle10: at least not every listing is a gdkp raid tho
[8:51:23] doofeeneed: hover over your hit
[8:51:29] MorrisonTH: or rogue*
[8:51:35] alisoninaisle10: its just like the same 4 ppl trying to sell mythic for irl money
[8:51:38] doofeeneed: your 4.33
[8:51:51] Bombadil_7: if your expertise and hitrating aren't capped then it doesn't matter, no?
[8:51:52] camyo: alisoninaisle10 tbh ive been looking for raids last few hours and most of them have been ms>os today
[8:52:08] kharma99: @Bombadil_7 until you miss a hoj GG KEKL
[8:52:08] seksmuhchine: says maydie
[8:52:10] Bombadil_7: am i wrong?
[8:52:12] hoveringpillow: What even is the point of a GDKP
[8:52:18] Bombadil_7: i don't believe in gdkp
[8:52:26] camyo: hoveringpillow get gold even if ur full bis
[8:52:32] doofeeneed: being a bit higher is decent for pally since your spells can miss
[8:52:37] doofeeneed: I think righjt?
[8:52:37] camyo: gives u reason to finish a raid if ur loot doesnt drop
[8:52:41] Bombadil_7: but so crit is like better than hitting?
[8:52:43] doofeeneed: or are spells tied to melee hit
[8:52:45] camyo: incentivizes people not to be shitheads or they dont get paid
[8:52:51] doofeeneed: and its the taunt that is spell hit
[8:52:53] Jelerman: bro look wrath would be so fun back in 2008
[8:52:56] hoveringpillow: So you have pay to play?
[8:53:03] seksmuhchine: ok
[8:53:05] camyo: hoveringpillow not necessarily but you pay for gear
[8:53:12] Jelerman: but today its just a boomer game like for degenerates like asmond
[8:53:13] Sazaruna: bro went to the barber and got a pair of balls, he should try that irl om
[8:53:22] ari_sap: you are still using your nerd voice btw. RP is over you can stop using it now :) (p.s. i would still sleep you with 1 punch)
[8:53:47] Its_Parker_Btw: accurate ari
[8:53:51] seksmuhchine: i'm bored
[8:53:53] alisoninaisle10: @camyo on wrath? yea idk im just going off what graycens saying, i just hate that gdkp exists at all, in vanilla im happy that i had a guild i ran with every single week almost never had to pug
[8:53:53] hoveringpillow: That sounds dumb tbh I dont want to pay for gear I had to already work for just to roll on lol
[8:53:54] Bombadil_7: LUL imagine thinking rp is ever over
[8:54:03] Jelerman: Sadge
[8:54:09] Jelerman: I walk alone
[8:54:10] camyo: alisoninaisle10 idk i think its kinda nice....
[8:54:21] Its_Parker_Btw: hoping new sod phase will hype it back up somewhat
[8:54:23] Dungar: graycen has massive cock
[8:54:28] doofeeneed: a while
[8:54:31] ClouderSavage: graycen are you walking alone
[8:54:32] brjnoqo3kd: hes the only reason RP is up
[8:54:39] Its_Parker_Btw: ya for sure
[8:54:45] brjnoqo3kd: cornwood is the only reason lol XQC barely play
[8:54:52] doofeeneed: gnomeragon zzz
[8:54:52] Bombadil_7: SoD Stormwind bars/taverns RP
[8:54:54] Jelerman: SoD was so crazy good
[8:54:56] Bombadil_7: actually good
[8:54:56] Jelerman: for 1-2 weeks
[8:54:59] ari_sap: at least you got in at the peak of 4.0 it was dead when you first played
[8:55:01] cap1337x: you think cata launch will be bigger than sod launch?
[8:55:02] Jelerman: than it died super fast :/
[8:55:05] Jelerman: :(
[8:55:05] doofeeneed: sod is fun if you like leveling
[8:55:06] alisoninaisle10: @camyo problem is when i actually want a drop i dont want to have to bid against gold buyers with irl money and guys who only run gdkps, so i rarely did it in vanilla
[8:55:07] TheNJV: Blizzard waited way too long for sod phase 2
[8:55:09] Sazaruna: wonder if esfand will maintain the 14 hour streams once SoD phase 2 drops, my guy has been grinding GTA RP, actually addicted
[8:55:19] camyo: make this macro and spam it and u can get in
[8:55:20] tingsdp: use macro
[8:55:26] HappysFunPalace: @Sazaruna 14 hours gta rp 4 hours sod
[8:55:26] camyo: .../run InviteUnit("a");C_Timer.After(.25,function() ConvertToRaid() end)
[8:55:35] sweatlordkush: did u quit wow
[8:55:37] yippykaiyay322: im still playing sod almost done with everything and leveling everything i can
[8:55:39] ClouderSavage: k Stare
[8:55:41] doofeeneed: ive seen that
[8:55:42] hoveringpillow: Yeah I feel like a GDKP would be bad just do to the people buying gold always out bidding you
[8:55:47] Kerminal: hey graycenb
[8:55:50] doofeeneed: its for mount farming
[8:55:50] camyo: it makes a fake group and sets it to raid and u can just walk in
[8:55:56] Its_Parker_Btw: cornwood is solid content
[8:55:58] alisoninaisle10: the only reason i had money in vanilla was because i sold dire maul tribute runs, princess ring in mara etc
[8:56:06] yippykaiyay322: all i got is fishing left and some lockpicking LUL
[8:56:06] Decoyduck: when is snakeybus content Stare
[8:56:09] f0rbin: esfand is actually employed at the LSPD now
[8:56:09] Bombadil_7: they rushed Phase 2 in vanilla and ruined game
[8:56:24] Bombadil_7: i don't mind waiting if they actually make game good
[8:56:42] ari_sap: so no palword w/o ang ccontent today?
[8:56:45] thorzain22: graycen is one of 10 people on wrath right now
[8:56:50] ClouderSavage: graycen at senior buns: READY TO WERK graycen running the cash register: READY TO TWERK
[8:56:57] KingEmil_of_Norway: sodaComfy
[8:56:58] Its_Parker_Btw: maybe some eye drops?
[8:57:03] alisoninaisle10: wowisdeadbaby
[8:57:05] ari_sap: gotta be atleast 50
[8:57:06] masteroogwayx21: Adam: whats the cat doing
[8:57:08] Jelerman: who the fuck play wrath man
[8:57:10] y_u_so_sussy: Technically part of the Alliance and under Stormwind's protection, Duskwood's distance from the mighty fortress and its close proximity to more malevolent forces in the south and east make it a realm of horror. Due to events central to the Scythe of Elune, Duskwood is a cursed and dying land (silence) Jusst like Graycen
