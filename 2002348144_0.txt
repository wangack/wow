[3:28:07] Hellacat: The Alabama beach mouse is one of several subspecies of old field mice living only in coastal sand dune areas. These small light-colored mice burrow and nest in dunes and are primarily active at night. They eat various plant seeds and insects. They prefer sand-covered slopes with patches of sea oats, beach grass, other grasses and herbs.

[3:29:15] Hellacat: The Alabama beach mouse, an endangered species, lives in coastal dune ecosystems. It's a small mouse with a buff colored patch on its back and snowy white underbelly. Strictly nocturnal in nature, they have large eyes and big ears to help them as they leave their burrows at dusk and remain active during the night.

[6:37:47] SupR3m3PriM3: I just read a story about a girl from the Trojan war named Bofidie who was a pecan saleswoman. Apparently, when Achilles was storming the castle after letting his troops in, Bofidie saw him coming and dumped her pecans on the ground in his path before she went to go hide. When Achilles walked through, he slipped on the pecans and fell, which let Paris make the shot that hit Achilles' Achilles tendon. So while Paris may have gotten the final blow, Achilles was really killed by Bofidie's nuts.
