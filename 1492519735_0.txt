[2:24:40] Sylphy_TV: Come to Dreanor EU, trade chat is fuuuucked
[2:25:06] QuigsTV: The thing about boosting is they can still run their business in discord and still sell items. Just add them on bnet so they look like your friend. Ez

[2:51:48] Urebaldd: Fury can wield double 2h don't see why they couldn't do that
[2:52:06] QuigsTV: @towelliee I like the black 2h sword from bfa islands
[2:52:41] BaxGamin: Have you done pvp with the hunter?

[2:54:28] amricatt: I believe so
[2:54:45] QuigsTV: I think it’s dumb that a paladin or warrior can wear leather not necessarily optimal but can’t tmog

[2:55:19] Breeb1: @Bricksawce why?? they dont need mobility
[2:55:33] vic_ave: its the illusion of plate not actually plate so a big diff
[2:55:37] Deadcells: towPog 9.2.5 imminent????
[2:55:38] amricatt: I want my casters to wear plate.
[2:55:40] ArcaneSyntax: I don't see them ever loosening transmog rules to allow plate to cloth
[2:56:00] gooni_coyg: u already have herritage armor that can be weared by all classes
[2:56:19] dracullus: still bigger than 9.1.5
[2:56:21] vic_ave: the dark iron weapon/shields are badazz
[2:56:30] Sollice: I wish you didnt have to level the class from 1 though for heritage
[2:56:30] Poriand: maybe a new allied race with pre order lol
[2:56:35] Kelticlore: maybe I want to tank in all cloth
[2:56:36] Breeb1: make sense a class dont using  because is a high mobility class, but outside this casters should use plate
[2:56:39] mavericks312: that green chocobo coming in 9.2.5 looks amazing
[2:56:42] Naturalbeef: Don't forget the secret allied race
[2:56:43] QuigsTV: @towelliee rp players would get huge improvements if they could do it

[3:13:38] TSquadSully: i think a ping system could help a ton
[3:13:39] NBK_Sethus: that's because they've obviously designed them around addons but refuse to admit it
[3:13:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there are a lot of things it could use
[3:13:54] dougefreshhhh: i think they just need to revamp the raid markers
[3:14:09] dougefreshhhh: and then raid leaders can only ping
[3:14:10] mavericks312: @Zethuz but there not
[3:14:15] belaham: LFR would be a ping fest if that was the case lol
[3:14:23] Clicklesly: Is that really that much different from world markers?

[3:20:16] warrenny: @belaham Yup
[3:20:25] doomester: @Towelliee also the affix removes the RNG of ppl getting better stats than others if they cant choose
[3:20:53] Libbzy: Awakening was the best
[3:20:59] Clicklesly: Probably also cause it feels like a big letdown after the current season affix
[3:21:07] QuigsTV: @towelliee at least it isn’t the bfa season 1 affix
[3:21:18] topdiesel2018: peapol need something to complain about
[3:21:24] dyslexican1: I just dont understand, why do we have to have an unrewarding extra layer of complexity. Like.. im sorry corruption was a failure. repackaging it does make it better...
[3:21:28] AlphasaurusRexx: current season affixes are good

[3:21:39] LieutLaww: damn WoW Token in EU is 302k
[3:21:41] Tjc222: Beguiling was the worst
[3:21:44] kelemental: preach!

[3:22:32] warrenny: @rockster09 40 min ish
[3:22:48] Tjc222: I thought infested was better than beguiling.. lol
[3:23:04] warrenny: I Didnt even get to infested
[3:23:37] warrenny: Encrypted is top imo
[3:24:04] Tjc222: pure power affixes are usually the best
[3:24:06] QuigsTV: @towelliee I liked the tormented mobs last season
[3:24:15] Tjc222: Prideful was the best in most peoples eyes
[3:24:23] CaptainJoeyNY: Ive done 1 mythic+ dungeon my whole life. Id love to get into it, but Ive always been so far behind in wow progression. Dragonflight, Im gunna throw down
[3:25:09] wildwittra: let them have a M+ season with the best Corrupted features. If you choose to many you get corruption-debuffs like before

[3:25:19] Aggravius: prideful was cool if u didnt pug it as healer on grevious when nobody used cds on it
[3:25:32] Scarhearth: Prideful didnt kill tanks though. It was annoying because you had to be perfect on route or you got screwed
[3:25:33] Sanctitas: padding andys
[3:25:48] Kobool: people had fun. so they liked it
[3:25:55] AlphasaurusRexx: tormented was wack
[3:26:00] Scarhearth: but pride was a damn easy affix outside if grievous.

[3:40:01] Dyasis: @Towelliee so I think it's like blackjack? it's players vs the house whoever gets higher numbers on cards wins so no turns?
[3:40:28] Poriand: watch from the start of the video. ben shows starter decks and talks more
[3:40:36] Brick_Bosworth: servers are up
[3:40:38] 3dRes: 6 turns, 3 areas
[3:40:39] Sollice: I think @Towelliee When they say you dont wait for turns, both players put their cards down at the same time and when the round ends the actions happen and then players do their turns simultaneously
[3:40:53] gobak2sleep: It's winning location 2 outta 3. ties go to highest overall power

[3:42:01] Sollice: @rockman7654321 They said they are working on a PC client for global release
[3:42:04] 3dRes: If you ever played Plants vs Zombies: Heroes then it has a very similar progression to unlocking other cards
[3:42:17] 3dRes: Like mini campaigns and whatnot
[3:42:19] tomfoolery_1: LOL
[3:42:22] notColt45: They have to let Ben Brode carry this for sure, he's so charismatic
