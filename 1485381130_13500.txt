[3:52:18] FranciscoTheMage: dispel does have a long cooldown
[3:52:18] Molvonos: S'why I play a lock.  Imp-dispel works wonders for a lot of content
[3:52:25] Folterun: decursive is great for on the spot cleansing and such
[3:52:31] skymercii: the problem is hes disc
[3:52:34] skymercii: LUL
[3:52:44] konnen_dev: did he PI himself?
[3:52:51] FranciscoTheMage: and mass dispel has a REALLY long cd
[3:52:52] Balkep: the healer is simply trying to pad numbers, hence the spears Kappa
[3:52:53] konnen_dev: LUL
[3:53:03] thatguynamedjans: I think the problem is that he is just standing still and not sidestepping spear at all lolll(or dispelling)
[3:53:10] thisissimi: Yo I can’t wait for Dragonflight. I really wanna try the healer evoker. I haven’t healed since MOP and can’t figure out how people do it today lol

[3:53:47] valianya: Healers today use addons
[3:53:50] Dyasis: rip
[3:53:50] skymercii: imagine doing this fight as disc
[3:53:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: He must not have a weak aura telling him how to do it
[3:54:02] Libbzy: there's the dc
[3:54:03] ArcaneSyntax: how hard is it to know to dispell a debuff lol.
[3:54:05] Molvonos: Healer DC/d
[3:54:05] jerseyfive: tell him
[3:54:06] Stonefather: He's D/C
[3:54:21] gfield2k: wow that's foul
[3:54:22] smashwow: you don't need a weakaure just look at your healing frames.
[3:54:22] riskqey: LUL
[3:54:23] Stonefather: SMH
[3:54:31] valianya: Have you tried explaining the dispels to the Healer?
[3:54:34] PadidinJones: TO THE BLACK BOOK!
[3:54:35] Tambandia: damn
[3:54:36] Ganohh: "priest suck" LOL
[3:54:38] skymercii: he rage quit
[3:54:40] OhNoNotAgain: those rage alt + f4s
[3:54:44] vic_ave: Blacklist
[3:54:44] killercondon: Rag does that a lot rather than finish
[3:54:47] thatguynamedjans: Omg... wow... what a waste of time. Should be reportable when its that obvious he did it on purpose lol
[3:54:55] Dyasis: @valianya I mean, it's an 11, he should know how ...
[3:54:56] Deadcells: People who ninja DC need to be suspended
[3:55:01] dyslexican1: lol what a POS. PEople who do that in keys man. ... I know " banning people" who do that consistently isnt popular. but other games do it all the time.
[3:55:05] ArcaneSyntax: was that healer from rag?
[3:55:05] T0MMYT: maybe boss is calling him or had to go to store and get diapers Kappa
[3:55:09] J_Rich94: hate when that happens, had dicks leave 2 times in a row at the last boss yesterday
[3:55:10] konnen_dev: kinda surprised there isn't a deserter debuff for m+
[3:55:11] vic_ave: Ragnaros/Azralon tanks leave keys alot
[3:55:32] Deadcells: @konnen_og there should be
[3:55:36] Shrenko: should be a punishment for those kinds of people
[3:55:38] magemaster225: thats the kind of thing that makes people uninstall
[3:55:39] warrenny: Book him?
[3:55:46] Slitze: or didn't happen
[3:55:47] Luuin: till they didn't happen
[3:55:48] im_capy: when the the life of a casual, is harder than the life of a mythic player Kappa
[3:55:53] thatguynamedjans: Omg, imagine? if you leave keys early you get a debuff that says "deserter: this user has left X keys this week before completion"
[3:55:57] gfield2k: That is why Guilds where a great thing to be a part of, in the early days of WoW. Then you just talk to that person on why they rage quit. Or just kick them from the guild
[3:56:00] CloudPants8081: globikLUL
[3:56:03] thatguynamedjans: and it just lasts thew hole week
[3:56:04] konnen_dev: if I get DCed in a bg I still get a debuff
[3:56:17] sifer007: they cant do shit KEKW
[3:56:28] CloudPants8081: not via ai? Kappa
[3:56:46] thatguynamedjans: Have you been raiding on this character?
[3:56:57] vic_ave: lmao
[3:57:06] Odd3ty: Hows ur gear goin?
[3:57:07] dyslexican1: There are systems for that in plenty of games IF it's regular people get suspensions and stuff. They just need to put a system in place for that. Look at games like League and such.
[3:57:24] valianya: This is why there should be bigger incentive for finishing and ways to have players give positive ratings so you will want high positive ratings
[3:57:36] skymercii: why play dick priest when you can just play the better spec... holy KEKW
[3:57:53] Stonefather: @valianya So social credit?
[3:58:01] Balkep: holy players LUL
[3:58:12] konnen_dev: yeah a rating system would get abused in .1 secs
[3:58:13] Mopac_: @valianya I agree but would fear negative griefing
[3:58:30] Lightninghandz: For all of you complaining about leavers, how do you monitor a group deciding to leave then? An agreeance of moving on to another key instead of finishing. Theres no way to differentiate.
[3:58:31] skymercii: i mean holy is preforming allot better rn then disc anyways
[3:58:34] CloudPants8081: towCringe
[3:58:46] im_capy: LUL
[3:58:47] ZeusDNA: LUL
[3:58:48] konnen_dev: a queue system for low lvl m+ keys wouldn't be super terrible tbh
[3:58:49] kailenfyre: haha
[3:58:50] OhNoNotAgain: lmfao
[3:58:55] CloudPants8081: globikLUL
[3:59:04] DeeterDo: i had to afk, you get devos?
[3:59:10] ZeusDNA: Blizzards FBI department
[3:59:13] thatguynamedjans: I mean, I see no problem just punishing everyone who does it regardless of reason.
[3:59:13] Short_Film: Damn Towelliee, Luka sending Chris Paul to retirement
[3:59:14] DeeterDo: ah damn..
[3:59:16] Arms_Warrior: ban his wife
[3:59:17] JediNeo99999: There's also valid reasons to bail on groups soemtimes too that you can't account for
[3:59:21] thatguynamedjans: If you dont have a stable connection, maybe dont play M+ lol
[3:59:21] c0mmander_starscream: "Game suxx mang, Im going back to PUBG fuck this shit mang"
[3:59:22] valianya: Negative reports for leaving could lower positive ratings but not below a threshold, one point per dungeon group so literally cannot spam negative reports
[3:59:23] Molvonos: Basement Mom aggro
[3:59:26] CloudPants8081: xqcT
[3:59:27] RaegonGaming: What is a wife?
[3:59:27] Stonefather: In a huge argument and she disconnected the router
[3:59:28] Stonefather: Who knows
[3:59:29] TheRiwen: wow players has wifies ?
[3:59:31] im_capy: wife comes over...."honey...you suck" alt f4d his ass LUL
[3:59:37] baby_sprinkle: #yaknow
[3:59:38] gfield2k: If my wife did that. I would be like, Sign here LUL LUL LUL
[3:59:41] ArcaneSyntax: also there are legit reasons to leave a key. it's not something they can automate
[3:59:54] ruhroraggy: just do league system, it issues penalties for every DC/leave regardless of the reason
[4:00:00] FranciscoTheMage: but there would be trolls abusing that
[4:00:06] crich85: I mean they ban people from matchmaking in ow as a leaver
[4:00:07] FranciscoTheMage: they dont want to be involved with researching
[4:00:08] Balkep: the wife was mad at his performance ingame, and offed him entirely
[4:00:08] Tambandia: i think any system like that is gonna get abused
[4:00:09] c0mmander_starscream: COnfiming it was his mother knocking on his basement door
[4:00:11] Lightninghandz: @ruhroraggy Ever watch high keys? when they fail they all leave lmao
[4:00:13] crich85: It’s similar in a way
[4:00:20] dyslexican1: That's exactly what im talking about. Its 100% possible.
[4:00:21] RollieTheZergling: starcraft kept track of a players disconnects exlibr1Dance
[4:00:23] amricatt: My cat used to rub against the router and it would flicker.  He may have needed to go to work.  Probably should've said it but still...
[4:00:25] thisissimi: Do like xiv 30min time out for early leaving regardless of circumstances
[4:00:42] konnen_dev: @thisissimi I wouldn't mind this tbh
[4:00:45] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: Shouldn't be able to mark someone as a leaver if you kick them yourself either.
[4:00:46] PadidinJones: I mean they have that system in place for Group Finder
[4:00:52] wildwittra: and anyone still in group gets end-of-dungeon loot
[4:01:00] Stonefather: 30 minute time out? Time to watch a show Keepo
[4:01:06] wildwittra: even if logged out when boss dies
[4:01:09] im_capy: 30 min break, is almost a nice thing actually
[4:01:13] dyslexican1: We have a rating system, which is fundamentally the same as ranked. And Moba's do suspentions, or time outs all the time.
[4:01:13] thatguynamedjans: Or just play another alt for 1 dungeon lol, 30 min is really nothing
[4:01:21] warrenny: Ban from keys for week
[4:01:32] Arms_Warrior: same should be for bgs, ppl queue in and go afk
[4:01:32] thisissimi: Gives you a second to cool down esp if the dungeon got you mad
[4:01:40] raldrik: What about for LFR bosses? Should be allowed to leave an LFR run?
[4:01:46] vulkankragon: ffxiv even penalizes you if you decline to enter the dungeon
[4:01:47] valianya: That's kinda what I mean, one group only gets 1 majority vote, pug groups cannot spam because you're so unlikely to get the same group again
[4:02:01] Persephonae: could make it a compounding punishment, 30min no dungeon timer, but if you get more than 1 in a specific amount of time the timer gets longer.
[4:02:01] thisissimi: It do, after three times
[4:02:04] kokochris: @raldrik LFR has always been drop in and out.  its well understood
[4:02:05] Lightninghandz: @vulkankragon Cause wow is for adults and FF for weebs
[4:02:08] angryteapot: How is your new world progression goin ? Do you still enjoy the game ?
[4:02:12] muricorn: !alpha
[4:02:12] im_capy: lets "test" this group - tanks thoughts with first pack
[4:02:12] TheRiwen: He play like me when i tank

[4:02:37] vulkankragon: @thisissimi a system like that in wow would be good
[4:02:39] valianya: LFR runs so easy tho, why leave?
[4:02:53] Balkep: @Mr_Capy_ true, I used to do that when pugging as a tank LUL
[4:02:59] kokochris: @valianya you ever been in LFR end boss on a raid.  Its chaos
[4:03:00] byrdeen45: what about the ones that leave after they get there item in a raid should they get 3 days also
[4:03:00] Stonefather: I mean LFR is harder than normal, have you seen the people in LFR?
[4:03:28] FranciscoTheMage: elder scrolls online????
[4:03:32] FranciscoTheMage: really?
[4:03:35] FreshieFresh: Why not GW2?
[4:03:41] konnen_dev: people are actually CCing in a low key? o_O
[4:03:58] konnen_dev: I'm kinda impressed
[4:04:02] vulkankragon: have they fix the combat in eso? last time i played it was very clunky
[4:04:02] valianya: LFR pug debuff lol
[4:04:24] konnen_dev: ye you can bait the barrage that way

[4:33:30] Deadcells: Oh shit I didn’t realize that many classes used polearms
[4:33:54] Deadcells: Guess the right question is which classes are required to use polearms

[4:45:27] mmo_kenna_: Story is amazing in ESO, great characters and voice acting
[4:46:02] Xanigh: i recommend the skyrim area
[4:46:13] belfastcl: next is greymoor (skyrim), clockwork city is great
[4:46:23] liviu_81: it was kinda meh
[4:46:26] Pescado_55: Elsweyr and Summerset are the best ones
[4:46:36] abracka_: the skyrim story was pretty good. the main story quest with coldharbour/killing molag ball got me from lv 37-50 as well
[4:47:18] ClockworkZen: Clockwork City you say?
[4:47:19] xoldwardog: after
[4:47:26] belfastcl: morrowind - summerset- elsewyr - greymoor - blackwood
[4:47:32] Pescado_55: Summerset came right after Morrowind

[4:47:55] Nostoroth: eso combat gets old fast
[4:48:25] GamingDad77: Good Morning @Towelliee and chat! What add-on would be good for finding the scrolls in ZM to unlock flying?

[4:49:57] GamingDad77: ok. ty @luchion09 amd @dyslexican1
[4:50:02] callmestray: I've tried ESO twice now and could never get into it. I think you're right on them needing to update the fluidity of it.
[4:50:09] BoezIRL: how's the rep going?
[4:50:16] luchion09: no worries m8 @GamingDad77
[4:50:30] duffluv22: @gamingdad77 Rarescanner I think I used. Showed the crates...highlight it and some showed scrolls
[4:50:55] Velashen: ESO combat feels like you are swinging through water. Very floaty with no feeling of impact.
[4:50:56] Sevrynx: i dont know how others feel about it, and im not even sure how to label it. but i cant stand how the damage on ff14 doesnt apply to the animation.
[4:51:58] feherlofia123: wonder why almost every mmo dont have good combat like wow. its like their not even close to wows combat
[4:51:59] BoezIRL: done for the day?
[4:52:00] belfastcl: eso combat is polarizing, but it's one of the reason why I like the game LUL , and I played wow sincebeta
[4:52:23] Nostoroth: true
[4:52:29] BoezIRL: yeah wowup is not working for me too

[4:53:33] MedicineMan: ESO is such an underrated MMO
[4:53:59] Sevrynx: i can tell you a game that felt like its combat felt impactful was Wildstar. just way to many projected fields to keep up with.
[4:54:04] belfastcl: LUL
[4:55:38] shobolt1980: is available only on steam??
[4:55:47] Nostoroth: its epic if you have daily
[4:55:55] belfastcl: I think those resets are account-related

[5:26:51] capitan_3steban: Nice one!
[5:27:29] Ertra: does ESO have a subscription to play?
[5:28:03] Havoc_S1: No
[5:28:04] capitan_3steban: It's buy to play - it was a sub for bank space and crowns
[5:28:06] Havoc_S1: It’s optional
[5:28:09] capitan_3steban: *has
[5:28:19] Mathuzalis: @Ertra not to play, but it's very rewarding to have.
[5:28:30] duhMarSeeYa: @Ertra It's not required to play the game, but there are benefits to having one (like unlimited mats bag, etc).
[5:28:44] belfastcl: and the dlcs unlocked
[5:29:03] Naewen: All the DLC too (not including recent main expansions) but yes crafting bag and 1500 crowns makes it 100% worth it already
[5:29:06] Ertra: i bought the game when it was on super sale, but haven't installed it yet...
[5:29:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: how much is it per month?
[5:29:10] z0mbawa: summerset isles is so Beautiful 😍
[5:29:19] nrthsidetee_215: Absolutely for the crafting bag
[5:29:20] thymos_: @Ertra wasting money KEKW
[5:29:33] Ertra: @Thymos_ i only paid like 4 bucks
[5:29:50] duhMarSeeYa: @z0mbawa Agreed! my fave zone.
[5:29:54] ogipk: 15 a month if you buy 1
[5:30:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: i'll probably pick this up the next time there is a good steam sale on it
[5:30:29] Ertra: eh i might try it.   I have zero interest in lost Ark anymore, and without a raid team in WoW, my interest is dwindling there
[5:30:42] z0mbawa: @imarseeya Hehe yess! it was my first actual area to master. got the title for it all!! amazing!
[5:30:50] thymos_: its a dragon
[5:31:01] LegoCoin: lol
[5:31:04] rymerre: oh solo dragon attempt? lol
[5:31:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: bots in my tier 3 cube run pushed me over the edge in lost ark so im done with that for awhile
[5:31:18] LegoCoin: POG just goes all out soloing dragon
[5:31:20] Mathuzalis: ESO+ Includes an unlimited crafting bag, all DLC's (not including expansions), doubled bank size, and 1650 Crowns (Their Premium Currency) a month. If you get ESO+ for a longer duration you get all the crowns at once, not on a month by month basis.
[5:31:59] duhMarSeeYa: @z0mbawa I started there also! I'm pretty psyched the new zone has some of the same vibes in a couple of the areas. I can't wait for it to come out.
[5:32:00] thymos_: find its exposed spot like they did in the hobbit
[5:32:11] Havoc_S1: Do you pay once and unlock the dlcs forever except the latest?
[5:32:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Havoc_S1 no not like swtor unfortunatly
[5:32:35] TompsonX: FUS ROH DAH
[5:32:35] Naewen: DLCs only unlocked when the sub is active
[5:32:38] Havoc_S1: O okay
[5:32:44] capitan_3steban: if you play ESO - ESO+ is worth it.
[5:33:04] Tyecron: Now repeat 5 times?
[5:33:05] LegoCoin: lol
[5:33:23] thymos_: these dragons are way cooler than wow's dragons
[5:33:25] Naewen: And as others have mentioned, buying 3-6 months of ESO+ at a time (once you know that you like the game) is even more worth
[5:33:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: if i ever do start playing this my plan is to just focus on leveling and save crafting till the end, at that point eso plus will make sense if it still has my interest
[5:33:42] TompsonX: I like this game, but I just think it's kinda funny that he's just staring at you as you throw eldritch balls at his face
[5:34:17] capitan_3steban: If more people would give ESO a change it would be popular. What hurt the game was at release it was f'n terrible.
[5:34:32] TompsonX: It feels like the kind of game that the monster would react to the pain, but it was just taking it
[5:35:17] thymos_: body slam Kreygasm
[5:35:19] Naewen: @HaxzorJimDuggan You don't have to focus on crafting, but I would STRONGLY suggest starting the trait research. Once you get most of the traits researched it takes a month to unlock a single one, and the more traits you have researched the better gear sets you can craft
[5:35:19] capitan_3steban: ult time wooo
[5:35:42] capitan_3steban: Towelliee's good too lol

[6:30:27] 7jers3y2: max gear level is 160. just get to that and you can start farming end game gear
[6:30:43] belfastcl: yeah
[6:31:08] Timothious: is he getting you a training set?
[6:31:08] CrunkyBrewster: the only thing i really despise about ESO is how they do Auction Housing. it's so dumb, im sorry LUL
[6:31:13] Angryfist40: not when you have people that will just craft for free lol
[6:31:24] brewmen: Are you researching traits on the main weapons and armor you use?  you'll want it for crafting and trasmuting
[6:31:33] 7jers3y2: has he unlocked a companion yet?
[6:31:34] LordxSaura: @ghst_WLF I think PC is way better
[6:31:40] belfastcl: clockwork is worth checking out, even if you decide not to do the quest, the zone is crazy looking
[6:31:54] Arcon_LP: Wrothgar is one of the oldest DLCs, but still very good zone and quest.
[6:31:54] CrunkyBrewster: Clockwork is cool yeah
[6:31:58] rymerre: training set is good
[6:31:58] LordxSaura: Trading is great in this game, you can literally be a trader and make a lot of gold by flipping

[6:32:22] gelimarr: Epic
[6:32:26] Timothious: yea they have hundreds of traders it seems
[6:32:27] brewmen: A lot of craftable armor sets have a minimum trait level, you have to have that many traits learned to craft a piece of that aormor
[6:32:38] 7jers3y2: 0
[6:32:41] LordxSaura: guild traders by themselves control economy and there are guilds that are mind blowing with technics and strategies etc. They offer money making classes :D
[6:32:41] Angryfist40: lol
[6:32:44] LordxSaura: its a lot of fun
[6:32:46] 7jers3y2: 69 gold

[7:22:50] Ed_Frigidhands: i am upset i can't DL it today
[7:22:51] bypized: Yeah it does
[7:23:10] Ed_Frigidhands: I think in the beginning they are going to limit things to 4 players per castle
[7:23:19] Ed_Frigidhands: but not sure
[7:24:17] EvilMrMcNasty: evilmr4GG
[7:25:14] ohmyjen: <3
[7:25:16] Ed_Frigidhands: its survival but they have made some changes to the formula. Incorporating some RPG elements.
[7:25:43] Ed_Frigidhands: its going to be my first survival game
[7:26:11] belfastcl: southern elsewyr is a lot of dying from falls
[7:26:26] chrslp: Man, what the shit is up with companies wanting people to have a Bachelors degree AND multiple years of relevant experience just to offer slightly above minimum wage LUL
[7:26:44] EvilMrMcNasty: it should be right out side the delv
[7:28:26] TompsonX: @chrslp Welcome to the job market
[7:28:49] KronnickTV: contrary to popular belief I think ESO is a great game, how are you enjoying it? @Towelliee

[7:29:02] Ghostpuddlez: this game looks fun, but i never could really get into it.
[7:29:09] Ed_Frigidhands: @chrslp Basically this.
[7:29:22] chrslp: FeelsBadMan
[7:29:44] c0mmander_starscream: "Everyone is getting clipped" -Joey BagoDonuts from Hoboken
[7:29:47] TompsonX: but millenials just don't want to work Kappa
[7:30:03] TompsonX: pull yourself up by your bootstraps and buy less avocado toast Kappa
[7:30:11] psycho_scythe: Towelliee playing ESO?! What is happening to the world
[7:30:20] chrslp: Like I have 5 years of office experience, 2 years of executive assistant to CEO, but no degree (some college) Can't seem to get a single call back for office jobs
[7:30:22] callum199724: any more wow today?
[7:30:46] Ed_Frigidhands: @chrslp Que the "no one wants to work anymore" rhetoric. Meanwhile companies making millions employ a skeleton crew of 2-3 to go through thousands of resumes and don't even get back to you for a status update for months.
[7:31:02] chrslp: @Ed_Frigidhands 100%
[7:31:08] belfastcl: in dungeons or some group delves where mobs don't deaggro it can be done, elsewhere...
[7:31:24] c0mmander_starscream: @chrslp is cheaper to automate or outsource that work
[7:31:43] TompsonX: It's ridiculous, half the reason I quit college and just started monetizing my hobbies lmao
[7:31:44] EvilMrMcNasty: how long have you been playing this for?
[7:32:00] Ed_Frigidhands: @chrslp I applied for a job managing stock options for investors and i had a guy on the inside tell me this company basically had 2 people reporting to 1 supervisor sorting through all the applications
[7:32:39] Ed_Frigidhands: @chrslp Lot of times they dont even get through all the applications and just forget to message the ones they didn't get to.
[7:33:04] TompsonX: I don't think it's even that they forget, it's that they do't care enough to message
[7:33:12] chrslp: Least they could do is have a cookie cutter email saying sorry we're exploring other options
[7:33:14] Ed_Frigidhands: That's basically it
[7:33:25] Ed_Frigidhands: yeah they don't care though
[7:33:44] TompsonX: That would require using 3 bytes of upload speed
[7:33:52] chrslp: And then they end up on Facebook complaining about how no one wants to work LUL
[7:33:57] TompsonX: Costing the company up to 1 kylobyte per decade KEKW
[7:34:19] CrunkyBrewster: a must
[7:34:22] belfastcl: true
[7:34:24] Ed_Frigidhands: meanwhile once you get a job paying decent, be prepared to surrender 1/3 your pay because your elected officials are greedy geriatrics who suck at their jobs
[7:34:37] CrunkyBrewster: trying to craft without the sub is inventory management
[7:34:40] chrslp: Luckily I live in WA and have no state taxes LUL
[7:34:53] Ed_Frigidhands: buddy make some room
[7:34:55] Ed_Frigidhands: i am moving
[7:35:01] chrslp: haha
[7:35:09] TompsonX: In my country (Portugal) the minimum wage is about 700€
[7:35:09] Ed_Frigidhands: They probably get you some other way
[7:35:15] chrslp: Federal gov always gets their cut though
[7:35:19] Ed_Frigidhands: my issue isn't state taxes, its federal
[7:35:22] TompsonX: when I looked up how much I would make as an enginner and saw 900€ on the first few years I quit
[7:35:25] Ed_Frigidhands: thats where all the waste happens
[7:35:56] chrslp: Hey- whats wrong with paying into Social Security when it probably wont even exist anymore by the time youre old enough to collect it
[7:36:08] watereddowncereal: just kill the boss an grab the skyshard, do the quest if the delve has one
[7:36:22] chrslp: LUL
[7:36:29] Ed_Frigidhands: Basically
[7:37:03] Ed_Frigidhands: meanwhile, a lot of these jobs are not hiring with work from home guarantee
[7:37:06] chrslp: @Towelliee If you weren't a streamer, what career would you do?
[7:37:55] Chuckforfun: What was your Job before Streaming?
[7:38:04] Ed_Frigidhands: Salt Trader.
[7:38:04] chrslp: LUL
[7:38:21] Chuckforfun: LUL
[7:38:34] chrslp: Benefits like...protein?
[7:38:43] Ed_Frigidhands: I didn't learn the phrase "dick cheese" until I played WoW
[7:38:43] chrslp: towLewd
[7:39:15] Ed_Frigidhands: tbh most of my questionable word vocabulary was learned during my time spent on my WoW server and the occasional moonguard video
[7:39:33] chrslp: I swear it seems like half the jobs in my area are insurance sales- and sales aint my thing lol
[7:39:52] Pharaoh_326: @Towelliee you can also loot those foot lockers at the end of the beds.  sometime they have schematics that sell for good amounts
[7:39:57] Cloheart: this legit looks cool... may have to try this class out!
[7:40:13] Ed_Frigidhands: Its necromancer, the class is a literal machine.

[7:41:50] Hyelander_: Necromancer is the same as when DKs were released during WOTK. OP as hell
[7:42:20] Ed_Frigidhands: The new classes (warden, necromancer) play much smoother. Regardless of when they were OP or not.
[7:42:24] belfastcl: there is an ability called bitter harvest that turns corpses into ultimate
[7:43:42] Ed_Frigidhands: My fav class is nightblade.

[7:52:37] ic3k0ld: found everything I use in 13 add-ons for ESO, I had more in WoW
