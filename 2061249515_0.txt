Blizzard has already said that certain extremely high ticket items that were made unobtainable like Spectral Tiger or Corrupted Ashbringer will be unlikely to make a return because of the prestige tied to these items. The idea that the Tiger has "prestige" is hilarious. It was a lucky draw from a card game pack."
