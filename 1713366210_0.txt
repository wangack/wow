[7:42:06] WoWPuggers: @Swifty I don't like curved monitors, because when you go back to a normal one the center of the screen looks as if it's bulging out at you, I personally think Curved Monitors are Terrible for your eyes.

[7:44:39] baron_signas: On the bright side, crafting the PvP epics has been pretty lucrative, even if I'm on a low populated server.
[7:45:30] baron_signas: Yes/No
[7:45:59] baron_signas: Personal and Guild is unlimited I believe whereas Public is 20, but the cd resets pretty fast.
[7:46:08] targus92dd: Public order is 20 max
[7:46:16] memegene42069: im not sure the Auction House is affected by server anymore.. i did a price check on various servers a while back and i noticed almost no price differences
[7:46:27] memegene42069: i could be wrong but it seemed that way to me
[7:46:35] baron_signas: They're reducing public orders next week though I think bringing it from 20 to 4 a day.
