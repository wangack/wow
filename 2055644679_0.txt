[1:24:05] OrbitalWarframe: Mitch has been in this cycle of self destruction for years and he's always dragging other people into it. He needs to get away from the industry and everyone in it and get help

[1:24:28] OrbitalWarframe: he clipped it like that to spin it his way
[1:24:28] qda__: sheeesh
[1:24:29] Ecaidian: The clips he did post and him not denying anything Miz said in the video look bad for him, not Miz...
[1:24:30] SenrabNairbGaming: especially if he actually initiated it
[1:24:30] lutherthe4th: at the point mitch pulls him out the car he is in mutual combat
[1:24:35] dwskittles: good script Pog
[1:24:37] big_gurl_entity: brians muscles aee hot

[1:25:04] Doog45: I was in his stream when this happened
[1:25:07] NutterCircus: I was in his Disco saying they need to be careful because TX will pick up charges if they have enough evidence of a crime.
[1:25:08] Lillmackish: Also, it sounds like Mitch definitely instigated the shit too? Nah, I don't think he's a victim until proven otherwise lol
[1:25:08] lutherthe4th: miz was within his right to rock him
[1:25:10] iCarDog: @outlawhawks99 you're listening to this and you think Miz was the one on drugs? OMEGALUL

[1:25:16] Massanylon: boohoo
[1:25:19] Skars111: wait what was it all over? i missed it
[1:25:21] AScandyWizard: It's crazy how much crucial detail he left out and then for him to double down on not wanting to talk about it anymore kills any credibility he has to his case. Lol
[1:25:25] AScandyWizard: Also hey Fandy.
[1:25:44] swampazzsusan: I fell out of an airplane without a parachute and survived. this is nothing.

[1:26:06] TheNihilistOne: Rat Jones is such a drama queen
[1:26:06] Mousara: I swear to God, all these guys are scheduling all these things for content and fooling all of Twitch!

[1:26:41] Doog45: hit
[1:26:46] dwskittles: 🤓
[1:26:47] smashviLLe: so mitch tells the guy "lets go" to fight, the guy rocks his shit, then hes cryin bout it
[1:26:48] AScandyWizard: Mhm
[1:26:51] Lillmackish: I don't doubt the damages. I'm curious on the responsibilities. You're not innocent if you instigate, and he was probably aggroing hard on coke
[1:26:53] smashviLLe: thats some shit u take to the grave
[1:26:57] Mousara: Dr. Bryan!!! Hello! :)

[1:27:41] ArdellanDH: dog shit people who are spoiled with rich ass parents and feel entitled to everything
[1:27:43] gothen123: yes obviously his fault
[1:27:47] Chromatus1: "he almost killed me" said the highly intoxicated person
[1:27:49] schonie: So Mitch picks a fight and loses and now whining about it

[1:27:56] MaRiNexICEx: Falling on deaf ears
[1:28:00] Smiliereu: obviously his fault for getting beaten for using words...
[1:28:00] Aegatron: i feel like this a cry for help from his side :p
[1:28:02] Stimutac: you cant help someone that doesnt want to help themselves
[1:28:04] outlawhawks99: If I was him I would show the full video
[1:28:05] Massanylon: He fucked around and found out.

[1:28:11] lutherthe4th: mitch pulls him out the car and says lets go that is initiating combat with miz there is zero assault
[1:28:14] Massanylon: Scientific method
[1:28:21] mochiiiburrito: no matter what youre not supposed to hit someone
[1:28:25] masonmadder: what does ja rule say about this?
[1:28:29] NutterCircus: I just dont think Mitch thought this whole thing through.
[1:28:30] Massanylon: Yeah, talk shit get hit
[1:28:31] PlSS_BOTTLE: should’ve hit him harder
[1:28:31] lutherthe4th: texas is a combat state

[1:28:46] SilverBugeye: from another party
[1:28:48] OrbitalWarframe: @aegatron nah he's gone to several people to actually cry for help after starting shit
[1:28:48] Tyler_YRPL: if he told him to kill himself sure hit him fuck it

[1:28:53] iCarDog: based
[1:28:55] EnVy1UP: Agree!
[1:28:55] mochiiiburrito: so assault is the answer?
[1:28:55] travisdom: Alinity said Mitch was getting into fights before and after this date. He had a pattern of behavior
[1:28:56] AScandyWizard: This is what happens when you constantly bite the hands that try to help you. Don't be surprised when one of those hands beat the shit out of you.

[1:29:01] tristtton: based
[1:29:01] bonziatv: W MIZ W MIZ
[1:29:03] GoFast__: why did miz attack him?

[1:29:16] Aegatron: @OrbitalWarframe ye ive understood that :p
[1:29:19] qda__: KEKW
[1:29:20] theorgeist: Own the beating and go on with your life
[1:29:20] mochiiiburrito: well the courts will decide wont it?
[1:29:20] Ecaidian: @mochiiiburrito it's not assault if Mitch started it
[1:29:21] arkthor_: sometimes you just gotta hit a homie to bring them back but Mitch just a rat
[1:29:21] lilyosa: not wrong
[1:29:21] iCarDog: you can't try and start a fight and then cry when a fight happens

[1:29:27] Angrybubble: W take
[1:29:30] explicittlol: no way people are still defending this rat
[1:29:30] johnnyi215: Miz maybe went a little overboard but Mitch deserves it
[1:29:31] Massanylon: Speaking as a member of the military.
[1:29:34] NutterCircus: Based Bryan.
[1:29:35] mochiiiburrito: see you in jail if you think violence is the answer in MODERN times
[1:29:39] PYRO_MANI8C: ive had to drop friends before to make them learn
[1:29:44] SilverBugeye: "violence is the answer throughout history" lol
[1:29:45] InChronicPain: "You pulled me out of the car and said lets go" IF mitch touched him he commited assult and miz defended himself
[1:29:47] Azrael1828: i dont think the hit was the issue, i think being unconsious and having ur head beat in then choked is more of the issue
[1:29:48] LuminGhost: some people don't understand anything but violence, and that's why it still has to be in our toolbox
[1:29:48] lutherthe4th: in another state it might be assault in texas it is not
[1:29:53] ManVsMachine: "violence is never the answer"... until it affects you
[1:29:57] shloom995: i dont like miz but im with him for this one been watching mitch since 2014 nd omg i cant stand this stupidity

[1:30:30] CowboyHeritage: mizkif about that life
[1:30:33] ArdellanDH: first of all , being drunk and on Cocaine is public intoxication which can be a double edge sword for both way
[1:30:34] BearL0st: Fight.. then have a beer.  Easy.
[1:30:35] Dishacker: @cappei what did mitch do ?

[1:30:44] Shannow36: I've never been in a real fight, but I've also never asked for it like that.
[1:30:44] Mr_Jemmz: To be fair though, if he is treating him like shit to the point he wants to off himself, you can not not come to point of being violent
[1:30:45] lilyosa: shitty situation for sure
[1:30:47] swampazzsusan: if I had a time machine I would go back and stop the fight and make a perfect vibe
[1:30:48] shloom995: words punch too you know???
[1:30:51] Doog45: miz roid rage?
[1:30:52] Smiliereu: hahaha lmao thats a question of definition when some one says "punch me"
[1:30:55] BanTheConfederateFlag: I missed this, seems like Miz sat him down

[1:31:38] Doog45: nothing ever seems to be Mitch's fault
[1:31:42] LuminGhost: The guy needs therapy, but it's not going to work unless he realizes that he needs it and wants it.
[1:31:45] epgpx: it is frustrating
[1:31:47] daltun: he didn't beat him to a pulp. that's so overdramatic. he had normal punch bruises on each side of his face.
[1:31:48] schonie: Mitch cuts the video to make himself look better

[1:42:48] Massanylon: Did you need stitches?
[1:42:49] CerebralSoldier: Long story short- Mitch was being a retard running his mouth, Miz sat him down like a toddler. Now Mitch is crying and telling lies to hurt Miz
[1:42:50] Doog45: @Lillmackish i saw him in the stream when he announced the fake accident last year, he definitely look like he had been beaten up
[1:42:51] BanTheConfederateFlag: all this twitch drama

[1:42:55] waakeland: im just a lurker and i agree with everything youve said BUT until we get the full story/video of the actual violence, i dont know what to think about Miz destroying him. clearly Miz can fight (if youve ever been in a fight, you know it's tough to land effective blows over and over unless youre experienced) and he's jacked. was it really neccessary to do what he did? again, no video. he could have needed to for his safety. but seems off at the moment

[1:43:12] lFinal: @MitchJones Miz should have beaten you harder, you should be a vegetable
[1:43:12] trollmasta66: Mitch, you might need to take the L and get some help. People have lows... it would play better if it is just two friends getting into a fight.
[1:43:12] CowboyHeritage: ill fight someone for freeee
[1:43:15] V1D3R0: @MitchJones if this is the date that you and your lawyers agreed to then it will be perceived as strategic instead of looking for compensation
