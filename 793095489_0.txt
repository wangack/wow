All who believe by faith this message in their heart and trust in Jesus to save them will be made right with God and will have the gift of eternal life and have a home in heaven after they die. Will you trust in him? If yes, then you can learn more about growing as a Christian by reading the New Testament part of the Bible.

[4:22:38] lostboys_: HACKERMANS he's in now guys, chat baited
[4:23:06] Nutzens: it’s DMCA they offer a compliance service. somehow to check web pages and make sure publishers aren’t violating copyright
[4:23:31] Nutzens: wouldn’t hurt to trial it
[4:24:07] chibiSKEPTIC: @jakenbakeLIVE can you click on the guy that the raid is saying is hella geared ?

[4:33:20] Nutzens: on another angle,, if you were to pay for the commercial version of services like satellite radio, as do businesses (restaurants, groceries, malls, etc) could you then use that commercially paid for content to have playing in the background. legit dmca compliant. those subscriptions aren’t cheap btw

[5:05:57] rawmoto: why is there monks and DHs in the raid????? kind of bullshit
[5:06:13] DrizzyWHU: thestockguy is a fraud he doesnt know
[5:06:17] stevenseagullplaysgalciv: stock guy is currently uploading the video lol
[5:06:28] balasparkle: Ive never done options but as I understand it depends on the premium and the cost at which you agreed to buy, and usually it’s 100 shares
[5:06:38] realeliotstabler: none if biden wins KEKW
[5:06:46] stevenseagullplaysgalciv: lol @realeliotstabler
[5:06:48] stebiee: just ask the gods in wall street bets
[5:06:57] Kloony: @rawmoto idk but seems like they dont even know the strat

[5:07:22] chibiSKEPTIC: ^
[5:07:35] stevenseagullplaysgalciv: lost $70 in the marker last year so I'm staying clear of answering lol
[5:07:37] yozron: @jakenbakelive hahaha how tf did u know i subbed before
[5:07:54] realeliotstabler: it could depend on the market at the time, then it would be impossible to calculate
[5:07:55] balasparkle: I guess it’s 100x(new stock value-agreed purchase value) - premium? Idk where commissions fit into that
[5:08:18] nerdyworm: An option is a contract to buy 100 shares.
[5:08:29] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @jomaoppa (warning)
[5:08:35] stevenseagullplaysgalciv: @jakenbakelive from random google
[5:08:37] balasparkle: Options are typically done in 100’s of shares afaik
[5:08:39] stevenseagullplaysgalciv: A call owner profits when the premium paid is less than the difference between the stock price and the strike price. For example, imagine a trader bought a call for $0.50 with a strike price of $20, and the stock is $23. The option is worth $3 and the trader has made a profit of $2.50
[5:08:42] pewtanblot: You here? @PolygonStatic
[5:08:56] PolygonStatic: @pewtanblot YEP
[5:09:08] balasparkle: Not 10k of dollars, you buy 100 shares i think
[5:09:37] pewtanblot: CHeck whispers @PolygonStatic
[5:09:51] balasparkle: So i think you would buy 100 shares at 20$, so you make 100*(30-20)-premium=1000-premium
[5:10:17] balasparkle: Someone correct me if im wrong
[5:10:17] jomaoppa: I think when most people buy options, they don't plan on exercising them
[5:10:20] watsupyouguys: nowad
[5:10:22] jomaoppa: they're just begging on the premium price to go up
[5:10:25] nerdyworm: So the current price is 42ish. If you bought a Jan 2021 55$ call and the price of the stock rises to 60 before Dec 30 you would double your money.
[5:10:29] jomaoppa: which is kind of a way to highly leverage your stock guesses
[5:10:40] jomaoppa: they're just betting*
[5:10:50] Kevman459: its degenerate gambling
[5:10:52] watsupyouguys: @NoWaddieNo yes ? :)
[5:10:54] jomaoppa: yea
[5:10:56] nerdyworm: But if it falls to 40.50 you loose half ;)
[5:11:01] Kevman459: and it hardly ever works out the way you want it to
[5:11:02] jomaoppa: but that's probably what most people talk about when they talk about trading options
[5:11:13] Kevman459: @nerdyworm you would lose it all
[5:11:28] Kevman459: unless you sold the contract early to someone else that still thinks its gonna go up
[5:11:30] Kloony: it's a wipe
[5:12:21] kengufall: helow
[5:13:00] nerdyworm: @kevman459 i should have specified loosing half by Dec 30.
[5:13:18] Kevman459: ah, yeah

[5:20:20] Kevman459: havent played since the prepatch, how come youre all level 30?
[5:20:26] balasparkle: @kevman459 one thing i want to ask though, is the reason options are high risk/high reward because it’s 100x shares?
[5:20:54] McMuffen_: Blizz did a level squish. Shadowlands cap would be 130. Now its 60
[5:20:54] RocOn: Hey Jake and Chat! hope U all R having a good night!

[5:21:10] sylarpc: I think I'll stick to kerbal space program haha
[5:21:16] Kevman459: @balasparkle that, and because you can lose your entire investment (premium) even if the stock goes up, but doesnt reach your target price
