[0:14:35] databob1: @mrgm morning MrGM
[0:14:40] tairyhesticle00: feel that
[0:14:42] MachoCham: Only gonna get worse my dude
[0:14:58] lyreilla: Ruh Oh. So you had fun is what you're saying. Recovery only gets worse the colder you get
[0:15:07] lyreilla: *older
[0:15:11] RAF_Sean: Wait until you’re 43 and standing up too fast hurts
[0:15:26] MachoCham: It's like having kids, you forget how much of a hassle they are so have another
[0:15:34] CrowMomocle: It's like childbirth, if you really remembered the first you'd never have another
[0:15:37] denery_zk: The brain forgets it and it only remembers the good feeling
[0:15:45] databob1: I very rarely drink anymore
[0:15:47] NeeK_23: I drink on friday then end up with 3 day hangovers, thats why I stopped
[0:15:52] RAF_Sean: Getting drunk is just borrowing happiness that has to be paid back the next day.
[0:16:15] JaviHeals: @databob1 Same, cannot deal with hangovers
[0:16:16] NeeK_23: @RAF_Sean with really rally bad interest rates
[0:16:33] JaviHeals: Oh wait yeah you showed O2 beer prices somewhere haha I remember seeing this
[0:16:39] MachoCham: Yeah but tomorrow Cham wasn't going to have happiness the next day anyway
[0:16:43] RAF_Sean: hahaha and the rates get worse the older you are @neek_23 lol
[0:16:43] Haestoh: There was like 3 support acts right?
[0:16:48] NeeK_23: have you financially recovered?
[0:16:49] AlfredK: How are they live now since Jordan Fish left? He sang a lot of the live stuff.
[0:17:23] RAF_Sean: New donation goal - cover the cost of 2 pints
[0:17:41] AlfredK: What?
[0:17:50] Elrathir: !
[0:18:15] databob1: @javiheals  my health is delicate at this point and my wife's on antidepressants so it's not a good idea...we made fla9vered egg creams for new years eve
[0:18:49] JaviHeals: @databob1 I was in bed by 11pm! lmao
[0:19:00] JaviHeals: And i have 0 excuse
[0:19:35] ahux_: I got seated for Slipknot, its all they had left
[0:19:41] Haestoh: I saw some Twitter videos of the pits at the Sheffield show and god, I hurt just watching it.
[0:19:46] AlfredK: Cooking stream?
[0:19:54] MachoCham: I was going to get Slipknot tickets, but they're fucking expensive
[0:19:59] databob1: @javiheals we're  kinda night owls so we were up until like 4
[0:21:17] Haestoh: YungBlud is from Donny
[0:21:18] databob1: @mrgm your hair looks really scruffable now
[0:21:43] MachoCham: Yungblud is very much silverspoon
[0:22:29] magemaster225: I mean instruments and lessons are pretty expensive so makes sense
[0:22:36] Haestoh: YumgBlud pretends to be northern working class, but his dad basically owned a music shop and ripped people off for a living.
[0:23:38] keyboardturner: catJAM  󠀀

[0:24:15] Haestoh: mrgmOk
[0:24:19] SlithTheSivak: dracJAM
[0:24:24] denery_zk: yep
[0:24:24] Ragnaros_Lothbrok: yo yo

[0:25:01] databob1: @mrgm if your gonna spew. Spew ino this.. *hand mrgm a small paper cup*
[0:25:31] AlfredK: God. How I wish our characters had the same fidelity as the characters in the new cinematics. Please beg Ion next time you talk to him.
[0:25:31] realnzall: @MrGM I prepared my Resto Druid alt for the Mage Tower last night with some low budget optimized gear and put in about an hour of attempts. I managed to get deep into stage 3 and had SIGNIFICANTLY fewer issues than I did on any other spec I tried
[0:25:36] NeeK_23: do you think 100% of Dragonflight is a huge task? feels like there are so many more things to collect than past expansions
[0:26:10] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 It is! Just some stuff is obscenely rare
[0:27:10] questmix: when do you think we'll see the troll heritage armor?
[0:27:24] Lausten: @MachoCham Dont even mention Lariat recipe or some of the others.. O_o NotLikeThis
[0:27:36] Layliah79: Happy Monday!!!
[0:27:41] AlfredK: Yep
[0:27:46] SlithTheSivak: then pandas and dracthyr are the only ones without heritage armor, likely get it next xpac
[0:27:48] questmix: i didnt know that! Kreygasm
[0:28:00] RAF_Sean: Just checked my banking and they pre-approved me for an 8k increase in my credit card. As someone who struggles with impulse purchases this is bad
[0:28:02] Layliah79: doing pretty good. back at work!
[0:28:18] RAF_Sean: Probably should have talked to the wife before smashing accept ><
[0:28:18] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak Dracthyr gotta be fast, they only got 3 pieces showing or so Kappa
[0:28:31] Layliah79: watched Lift with Kevin Hart on Netflix this weekend. It was worth the watch.
[0:28:57] Layliah79: i use my credit card once a month then pay it off before it's due just to keep more credit history
[0:29:24] realnzall: @MrGM It's basically a mini dungeon with 3 NPCs that just do some autoattack damage, but if you or any of them dies the scenario stops and you need to try again. Thing is that their damage is too low to feasibly make it, so the player needs to put in quite a bit of damage and CC
[0:29:25] RAF_Sean: Wife said I could buy an elgato teleprompter and I added 2 packs of their sound panels and a new stand with it
[0:29:49] RAF_Sean: It’s free money - my brain is obviously broken lol
[0:29:56] Haestoh: We have a CC but pay it off literally every month fully. We treat it like a debit card and just do it to get credit rating and virgin travel points.
[0:30:06] Lausten: Bird got it
[0:30:21] RAF_Sean: Wish I could do that @imjoeski
[0:30:27] JaviHeals: @imjoeski Yeah you should technically buy everything on  CC then pay off in full
[0:30:28] Lausten: <-- Wowhead
[0:30:40] Lausten: 5Head
[0:31:13] Layliah79: How was the concert??
[0:31:19] JaviHeals: Oh wait I didn't realise Zygor has achievements etc!!!!
[0:31:23] JaviHeals: I use it just for levelling
[0:31:24] Layliah79: I saw the tweet on beer prices

[0:31:49] realnzall: @MrGM healing mage tower: modified version of second half of BRH with 3 Val'sharah NPCs. they just do a bit of autoattack damage, so you need to put in damage yourself while interrupting, dispelling and CC'ing

[0:33:05] BBMezzy: Track treasures doesn't exist anymore :(
[0:33:16] Layliah79: prob with reset
[0:33:23] AlfredK: Getting like a rum and coke in a bar is half the price of a full rum bottle
[0:33:27] SlithTheSivak: u turn it on at the rostrum
[0:33:46] realnzall: @MrGM It is, and Resto Druid is the easiest version because mobs have the least amount of damage, plus druids have exceptionally well suited CC and damage/healing profile
[0:34:09] realnzall: @MrGM *least amount of healing*
[0:34:47] MediumRareOG: i've been slowly getting gear to do all the mage tower challenges. haven't done 1 yet
[0:35:54] Ganner25: Love that mount
[0:35:57] Ganner25: so so much
[0:36:07] Ganner25: Flying head
[0:36:08] MediumRareOG: Dan, the timewalking spreadsheet has a tab for BIS mage tower gear
[0:36:38] AlfredK: The horde can't get their chopper anymore :>
[0:36:38] JaviHeals: What about things like Visions of N'zoth? Does it scale or is it all 1 shot now?
[0:37:18] magemaster225: yeah healing mage tower is by far the hardest and if youre not familiar with healing I couldnt imagine
[0:37:26] NeeK_23: visions may be limited only my sanity timer and if you can run it  fast
[0:37:27] lequani: any plans to play SoD p2 ?
[0:37:32] JaviHeals: Well off I go to to em!! :D
[0:37:42] MediumRareOG: Visions is still annoying with 5 masks because you're constantly being knocked back and thrown around
[0:37:58] realnzall: @MrGM if your TW set uses Azerite armor or old legendaries, it doesn't work well. Blizzard disabled loads of old borrowed power systems in TW mage tower like Azerite Armor, Azerite Essences, BfA cloak, MoP cloak, WoD ring and all tier sets, including DF ones
[0:38:17] NeeK_23: visions become selfsustaining once you can full clear. you get enough currency to buy the next entry
[0:38:26] Lestatis: who do you think wins?
[0:38:27] MachoCham: Counting down the hours
[0:38:38] Haestoh: HYPE
[0:38:49] widdlywhee: So this is where all the cool kids are hiding 👀
[0:39:14] Haestoh: Royal Rumble and NFL Divisional Playoffs. I am gonna be tired AF next week.
[0:39:24] hi_im_kage: i remember farming echoes for vision keys in sl prepatch for mount and i havent touch them yet xD
[0:39:55] widdlywhee: Right, but aren't all the true pals in here? ;)
[0:40:46] MediumRareOG: I need to do about 40 visisons to get the mount, ugh
[0:40:47] BBMezzy: Oh yea there's also the twitch drop this week
[0:41:49] hi_im_kage: ye its random and one phial can reset your buff
[0:41:50] Lausten: Are trial accounts put on a worse server than regular players? I have so much loot lag right now in Gilneas doing the intro quests for each class
[0:41:51] santaria99: Oh so no twitch drop toda
[0:42:20] santaria99: Kk
[0:42:25] santaria99: Thx
[0:42:50] SirJammyy: Hey Dan, I have not played Retail in nearly 2 years. Whats best way to get back into it? Should I create a new player and learn the new ability’s through lvling?
[0:43:11] realnzall: Shadowlands
[0:43:15] yuldovah42: SL
[0:44:10] NeeK_23: I always recommend leveling. a boost just throws everything at you and you'll be overwhelmed and just not bother

[0:45:00] Dayvi_here: Reti pew pew tion
[0:45:01] wildwittra: follower dungeon ??
[0:45:14] MachoCham: I absolutely would rather level a new spec from 1 than respec
[0:45:17] MediumRareOG: i've levelled every class and can play like 3 of them
[0:45:20] MachoCham: So I can learn it at a pace
[0:45:58] Haestoh: Honestly how far I've played with the GF in retail. We're currently level 30 and since level 10 there's no guidance into anything.
[0:46:06] Prima_Luxora: Hi my favorite game is wow YEP
[0:46:06] MediumRareOG: how to play a spec changes every patch
[0:46:12] Mazerbeam: Leveling is more fun if you actually like to look at talent trees and learn your rotation without looking at Wowhead
[0:46:18] Prima_Luxora: good
[0:46:21] AdamShwaginz: morning beautiful how was your concert
[0:46:23] MachoCham: It was one of the biggest issues for me with FFXIV when I wanted to swap to a job that starts at level 50 with all the spells and it was completely overwhelming
[0:46:47] AdamShwaginz: lol Jesus
[0:46:49] MediumRareOG: wow just has too many abilities in general
[0:46:58] Layliah79: mrgmKEKW
[0:47:03] AdamShwaginz: KEKW
[0:47:09] databob1: I don't play wow anymore..I live wow...or is that kinda cringe
[0:47:32] NeeK_23: the core rotation and understanding of a spec doesnt change each patch. Sure there are changes but even major reworks are the same at the core with a few extras thrown in
[0:48:12] Haestoh: I've never understood why people don't carry their ID with them if they have it.
[0:48:26] Haestoh: especially if you're leaving the house.
[0:48:30] Haestoh: on a night out
[0:48:42] AlfredK: Yea I had to scan my ID in London...
[0:49:06] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite

[0:49:49] NeeK_23: they can just steal your physical passport too
[0:49:50] RenzikOz: pick and choose lol
[0:50:03] Haestoh: I'm sure you can apply for an ID card for like £15
[0:50:14] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak Compared to the wallet you have in your backpocket with everything in it that gets pickpocketet LUL
[0:50:21] MachoCham: Depends if the bar accepts that ID card tho
[0:50:23] RenzikOz: we have a Aus app that has licenses and shit on it
[0:50:30] RenzikOz: but I couldn’t even use it in the bank
[0:50:41] MediumRareOG: In the US, you can get a non-driver's license state ID. Kinda weird the UK doesn't have that
[0:50:55] SlithTheSivak: @Lausten never been pickpocketed, but ive had my identity stolen twice, once with an rfid scanner
[0:50:57] RenzikOz: they needed physical to open bank account pretty pointless having digital
[0:50:59] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[0:52:01] NeeK_23: the sausage one is easy btw
[0:52:09] SlithTheSivak: german is a cash only society
[0:52:12] Haestoh: When I use to work in retail (nearly 10 years ago) we always got people using the Citizen ID cards and were always told to accept them as you would a passport/drivers license. Weird that bars are funny about it.
[0:52:23] MachoCham: Sorry Dan, you're not fooling anyone that they're asking you for ID
[0:52:34] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak So you carried a psychical card with NFC and got your identity stolen by someone, thats why I use an RFID proof wallet
[0:52:44] keyboardturner: what if he thinks you genuinely believe it's southern house and doesn't want to correct you
[0:53:03] MachoCham: Is that for PubWatch?
[0:53:03] Ckraigfriend: hey mrgm did you know that dragon riding mounts can fly normally in the old world when you arr level 30
[0:53:06] SlithTheSivak: @Lausten i have one now!
[0:53:09] MediumRareOG: tip: NEVER go anywhere in the US without carrying ID
[0:53:13] chefdejour82: do they scan it
[0:53:19] realnzall: I consider that a good thing
[0:53:23] SlithTheSivak: @Lausten this was 10 years ago
[0:53:24] RenzikOz: they sign u into the venue here also
[0:53:38] Haestoh: It's incase you get into a fight or do something illegal, so they can Identify you to the police.

[1:01:56] MachoCham: It's not a good night out without Sambucca
[1:02:12] xHukk: @imjoeski 100%
[1:02:30] Haestoh: So you know how they're trying to make all cars electric by 2050. That means all cars won't pay road tax cause 0 emissions.  So by proxy all other taxes will go up to cover the missing funds.
[1:02:33] JakeSezz: @mediumrareog And those of us in the military, u less forward deployed to the Middle East, still pay taxes. But, I’m w/e cuz we have more shit to worry about than taxes.
[1:02:52] xHukk: Here in the US..  @imjoeski they tax your money earned, then tax it again when you want to spend it..  Then tax it again if you die and it goes to your kids..  So..  yeah, taxes are a scam 100%
[1:02:59] databob1: Did she wimeigh the Sama as a duck
[1:03:13] MachoCham: I'd be more worried about how they replace the fuel duty than road tax
[1:03:21] Lausten: @imjoeski Road taxes cover more than emmision lol, do you think asphalt is free? LUL
[1:03:44] Haestoh: All new build houses are mandatory built with electric charge point if it has a driveway.
[1:03:50] MachoCham: Yes you can
[1:04:01] keyboardturner: MonkaS
[1:04:04] JakeSezz: I have no clue lmao
[1:04:07] MediumRareOG: @xHukk virtually nobody pays taxes when they die. the threshold now is like $11 million
[1:04:13] michaelmm: I don't know about the US but in the UK tourists can get VAT back.
[1:04:16] Layliah79: During this cold weather surge across the US - Tesla electric cars are having A LOT of issues due to the cold weather leaving drivers at a standstill.
[1:04:22] magemaster225: is that a weird way of describing the duty free store
[1:04:26] JakeSezz: My house is 2 years old. False af, At least in SLC.
[1:04:41] Haestoh: @Lausten Ofc, road tax pays for public services also. But I'm saying they're going to make all cars not have to pay "emissions tax" it'll bump everything else up.
[1:04:56] keyboardturner: americans: what's a holiday?
[1:04:56] StreamElements: Click on my link www.hellofresh.co.uk/MRGM and order your Box for less than £4 per meal!
[1:05:09] Layliah79: @keyboardturner vacation
[1:05:12] MachoCham: @imjoeski They'll just change the rules as they constantly do and Electric cars will have to pay tax
[1:05:12] JakeSezz: My house is hella bougie and new and we damn sure ain’t got no mandatory charging points. That’s some crazy shit right there 😂
[1:05:21] keyboardturner: americans: what's a vacation?
[1:05:28] keyboardturner: i'm making fun of our lack of time off
[1:05:32] Bware2: taxes are a scam... hehe. yeah, pays for unnecessary stuff like police, schools and hospitals... scam I say ;)
[1:05:33] Layliah79: lol
[1:05:53] magemaster225: when I did retail for 5 years there was only one instance of somebody using a visa to remove the tax from the purchase and it took forever to figure out how to do it in the system
[1:05:58] JakeSezz: @bware2 who needs ‘em, right?!
[1:06:06] Lausten: @MachoCham Yeah of course they have to, cant cover the cost of maintenance without taxes, or tollbooths will be on every street LUL
[1:06:08] keyboardturner: for most generic jobs yeah
[1:06:15] Layliah79: I get 3 weeks vacation, 1 week sick time and 1 week personal time a year - in US.
[1:06:18] physalis4: I get like 4 weeks pto, but I've been with my company for 15 years
[1:06:18] JakeSezz: Depends on the employer and what your PTO looks like
[1:06:19] Haestoh: @MachoCham Aye probably, they'll reword it from an emissions tax to a "use of public highway" charge or some bollocks.
[1:06:43] physalis4: yeah all depends on the company
[1:06:58] physalis4: and what type of an employee you are, hourly vs salary.
[1:07:04] BBMezzy: 1 week sick time? Yikes.. imagine being sick for longer than a week
[1:07:07] xHukk: I get 150 hours of PTO with my company.  Been here 6 years.
[1:07:11] MediumRareOG: The US is a dystopian hellscape

[1:07:30] NeeK_23: the weird thing about the US isnt that the dont have much paid time off, its that so many defend the lack of it as a good thing
[1:07:36] xHukk: @Layliah79 :O
[1:07:44] michaelmm: Depends on the company - some will let you use holiday time.
[1:07:50] lyreilla: At my place, we're salaries and it's unlimited PTO obviously with discretion. Then we have 2 weeks sick time, and 8 hours of volunteer time.
[1:07:57] FelPlague: 6 months sick pay? in what world
[1:07:58] physalis4: I'm salary. I get paid no matter what. I've supervised ppl that are hourly and been sick longer than their pto...yeah they go unpaid
[1:08:39] MachoCham: I mean that 6 months is over a rolling period, not every year. You'd be let go if you had 6 months sick a year
[1:08:40] Haestoh: I'm salary and get 20 days (have to save days for Christmas week) plus bank holidays. But 0 sick days. My jobs holiday/sick pay policy is ass.
[1:08:55] michaelmm: professional jobs often give their staff insurance cover for longer periods of illness.

[1:09:47] MachoCham: I find that WFH I work pretty much regardless
[1:09:52] Haestoh: @lyreilla Honestly I thought it was normal to not get any sick days for the longest time.
[1:09:59] physalis4: Just power through the day, and take a nap on my lunch break
[1:10:01] michaelmm: If you jobs is output driven they usually let you catch up on it later.
[1:10:06] xHukk: @MachoCham same
[1:10:17] xHukk: Hard to call in sick when you work from home.  lol
[1:10:41] MachoCham: I mean that's the thing, I've worked where I absolutely shouldn't have
[1:11:03] MachoCham: Just because I can, if I was in the office I wouldn't have
[1:11:11] JakeSezz: @xhukk You would think, but happens all the time in my job jakese1LUL

[1:12:25] michaelmm: It's like 0.1% of something like that.

[1:12:44] MachoCham: 0.03%
[1:12:51] physalis4: There are some BFA mounts you can get off the AH.
[1:12:54] Mystic_Bard: @NeeK_23 4, 2 in horde areas and 2 in ally areas
[1:12:55] NeeK_23: I managed to farm 2 hyenas in BFA, sold one for 400k, kept the other
[1:13:08] MediumRareOG: you should be able to buy the pack mule for <100k from the AH

[1:34:32] physalis4: so over the top
[1:34:37] Lausten: Dont ever trust her with a shotgun, shes got temper that one!
[1:35:13] physalis4: Is Nintendo going after them?
[1:35:17] keyboardturner: too complicated to explain shortly tbh
[1:35:23] bwoods79: multiplayer as well
[1:35:26] michaelmm: They've been accused of copying Pokemon assets and using AI.
[1:35:27] JakeSezz: People are claiming the game’ visual assets are AI art. Basicaly
[1:35:28] Harai_Ulfsark: we're really in a world where a lazy asset flip game is making billions KEKWAIT
[1:35:29] keyboardturner: *maybe* it used AI, it basically rips off pokemon, etc.
[1:35:31] ArcainTink: Hey mrGM. DO you see any fixes to achievements on the PTR? they are completely broken on live
[1:35:42] zhui_: I don't think there is any proof that AI was used but the CEO seems to be really into AI
[1:35:59] Lausten: Half the achievements seems broken
[1:36:05] michaelmm: There's a blue post the devs are working on a fix for the Acheivements issue.
[1:36:25] michaelmm: It kinda looks like some account wide stuff went wrong.
[1:36:38] ArcainTink: mounts, quests, ive found about 10-15 and the only response i got from the gm's was they are working on a fix BUT the fix may not be retroactive and we will have to redo alot if not all of them
[1:36:47] magemaster225: I think Ive seen some model comparisons where its like the rigs are 1:1
[1:36:50] NeeK_23: hope the fix for losing my titles every time I log in is coming soon
[1:36:55] AlfredK: Even if it is AI or not some designs are ripped off
[1:36:58] physalis4: Nintendo is famous for being stubborn and just wanting to do their thing tho
[1:37:03] windfrenzy: still on that 100% grind huh
[1:37:27] bwoods79: microsoft just started opening up xbox exclusives to other platforms
[1:37:45] Harai_Ulfsark: jumping puzzles? on my wow?
[1:37:56] calphan84: xbox and pc
[1:38:14] keyboardturner: i frankly don't know why it's suddenly come to attention now, I remember seeing palworld at like gamescom or some other game showcase thing years ago
[1:38:43] LaMu2560: Because it just came out lol
[1:38:50] Harai_Ulfsark: as if the totoro electabuzz wasnt bad enough
[1:38:53] AlfredK: There is another one that looks exactly like a fluffy Eevee @MrGM
[1:38:56] keyboardturner: yeah it's just come out but why was nobody angry about it back then
[1:39:02] Dcully: @keyboardturner just realesed to early acces thats why
[1:39:54] Larkaro: Nintendo lawyers about to go crazy
[1:39:59] WolfSpirit80: sadly the Pals don't evolve tho
[1:40:21] keyboardturner: surely nintendo would have seen these designs years ago and a lawsuit already would have happened toy
[1:40:22] windfrenzy: I feel if its based off a real animal its hard to copyright
[1:40:23] keyboardturner: tho*
[1:40:27] AlfredK: Search for Palworld Pokemon comparison
[1:40:29] LaMu2560: I don't care about the game, but I don't understand why people are mad about it. Just let the Pokemon company fight their own battles if they want? It's not like they are a small company

[1:42:10] Mystic_Bard: there are a bit more than 1000 pokemon, some will look similar
[1:42:19] thunduz: oh there’s no question lol it’s a “here’s my homework to copy just change it up a bit…”
[1:42:33] keyboardturner: I just can't really care about it when others seem to have so strong feelings about the whole thing lol
[1:42:49] Lausten: @Harai_Ulfsark What? Heroes of Might and Magic is the best game ever :D
[1:42:59] Mystic_Bard: imo I don't want the next pokemon game to be like palworld
[1:43:09] Haestoh: Remember when you use to go seaside as a kid and they'd have knock off versions of pop culture stuff. Thats pal world mrgmKEKW

[1:46:04] NeeK_23: can it be like Reading Leeds? we can have WoWcon North and WoWcon South
[1:46:36] Mystic_Bard: British-Con ?
[1:46:52] Larkaro: PTRcon - Party Till Raid Con
[1:47:12] Mustache_Menace: is there a mod that tells you where quest are and. it’s corresponding branched quest?
[1:47:17] Lausten: Meetup
[1:47:23] Mystic_Bard: nah, but it can be held anywhere on brithis islands without having to change name
[1:47:30] NeeK_23: LFG Looking for Gathering
[1:48:09] NeeK_23: quikc im trademarking it xP
[1:49:12] CrowMomocle: Holding cons in the northern part of England is so much cheaper than the south
[1:49:52] CrowMomocle: The booze for a start
[1:50:08] CrowMomocle: buy a pint up north is fair bit cheaper
[1:50:10] Haestoh: London/Manchester is probably very comparable.
[1:50:18] JaviHeals: There's the huge conference centre in Farnborough... so not just London either
[1:50:27] JaviHeals: Runescape even does theirs in farnborough now I believe
[1:50:28] Haestoh: Chesterfield, you poor soul.
[1:50:35] JaviHeals: LMAO!
[1:50:41] CrowMomocle: You need a good con organiser to negociate cheaper prices
[1:50:47] keyboardturner: doxxed wochi
[1:50:49] JaviHeals: Yeah dw I wasn't suggesting it hahaha
[1:50:51] Mystic_Bard: Not_London-con !!!

[1:52:05] CrowMomocle: maybe higher alcohol
[1:52:22] CrowMomocle: well the venue itself give free space but require you to fill the hotel
[1:52:50] CrowMomocle: conference rooms
[1:52:52] Haestoh: From the emails you showed me it seems like they genuinely just wanna support the event.
[1:54:28] JaviHeals: fuck that
[1:54:56] physalis4: I had one of my parents friends say they saw my live notification on FB and started asking questions. I was so embarrassed lol
[1:55:10] Haestoh: Nope, I created separate socials to advertise my content and I hate when IRL friends come into my stream.
[1:55:30] physalis4: It was more so...I can explain it to them and they still wouldn't know what I was talking about
[1:55:38] JaviHeals: @imjoeski literally it's weird
[1:56:03] Mystic_Bard: If I was streaming etc for the sub 10 viewers I would def gather them all, family friends etc
[1:56:52] physalis4: I've learned that irl friends don't give a F
[1:56:58] Rico_Azzarash: Good time of the day everyone! < 3
[1:57:03] JaviHeals: Oh you applied for a streamkey?
[1:57:11] JakeSezz: It don’t bother me, really. If I say some shit on stream that surprises them, they can’t be that close of friends or family lmao
[1:57:33] Haestoh: I like to keep it separate because I can embrace the degenerate and stream till 3AM and not get judged
[1:57:39] s7wede: Hey Dan
[1:58:09] MediumRareOG: a lot of people just stream their facecam on tiktok and try to drive people to twitch
[1:58:29] JakeSezz: I’ve done a great job of making an ass of myself IRL that I have no reason to be embarrassed to have IRL peeps to show up
[1:58:36] JaviHeals: @MediumRareOG Yeah with a piece of paper with their twitch
[1:58:52] s7wede: All good, almost rank 3 with the the Archives. This is probably the worst rep to grind in a long while
[1:58:54] JaviHeals: Yes legitimately haha
[1:59:12] MediumRareOG: Your facecam would actually work well on tiktok imho
[1:59:40] Lausten: The background I guess
[2:00:00] Lausten: Its actually showing something compared to a girl lying in her bed
[2:00:09] thunduz: MRGM I have this amazing idea. how about you go to this meeting I have to head out to and I play Warcraft for you. fair trade?
[2:00:11] MediumRareOG: because it's basically "just chatting". you don't need to see the gameplay. so it's something you could listen to
[2:00:12] Haestoh: Are you allowed to dual stream as a twitch partner?
[2:00:16] MediumRareOG: i mean that seriously
[2:01:00] keyboardturner: government emails always feel more fake than scam ones
[2:01:03] thunduz: cool cool, can you make it to the US in about 20 minutes?
[2:01:26] Haestoh: TouchPadWarrior does really well on TikTok. taking a trend and applying it to WoW, I love his stuff

[2:03:10] NeeK_23: during the dig event, there are the blue ghost sites but the button doesnt do anything. is that right? I've done all the tutorial quests
[2:03:25] s7wede: No description, no rewards and no follow up quests
[2:03:30] BBMezzy: I'll let you know in an hour if you get something from rank 3.. i'm 130 rep away
[2:03:48] BBMezzy: Yup
[2:04:03] BBMezzy: do event, log out and do other stuff until event again
[2:04:11] funviking99: has anyone got the hat from the event?
[2:04:27] s7wede: Also there is a missing piece of transmog for the excavated version of the set. You cannot get the helm in-game as of this time
[2:04:43] funviking99: from the tmog

[2:05:01] havoom01: i just bought the mount from vendor,only 218k fragments to collect..few months and its done lol
[2:05:03] Larkaro: I just dont find the event all that engaging to park myself there
[2:05:10] funviking99: yeah that
[2:05:14] keyboardturner: i've yet to get the helm myself, pretty certain that'st rue
[2:05:17] keyboardturner: i have ever other piece
[2:05:35] physalis4: I haven't started it yet. I just want the mount really
[2:05:42] s7wede: It's speculated that the excavated helm is the reward for the meta achievement for the Azerothian Archives since it shares the same icon
[2:05:42] BBMezzy: Everything about this <expletive> makes me ask, is half the content actually still encrypted?
[2:05:54] Lausten: I feel like the event is 50% done, theres no real explanations and half the time the objective just vanishes or gets completed by someone else it felt like
[2:06:09] Haestoh: Had a random thought about Gilneas. If they make it a capital city, it would be cool to link the deep run tram to it and make that section of the tram “old school London Underground esk.”
[2:06:22] Scraggersmeh: Why bother encrypting world quests? Who the fuck is going "OH MY GOD YOU SPOILED THAT WORLD QUEST FOR ME. HOW DARE YOU!"
[2:06:23] MediumRareOG: it's probably not finished
[2:06:35] havoom01: so far WQ doesnt give any fragments, just gold,i hope they change that to make it easier to farm them
[2:06:57] havoom01: gold and rep
[2:06:59] BBMezzy: Depends on your luck, mine only gave gold too
[2:07:00] s7wede: Only the 1 does this week
[2:07:04] s7wede: but it gives rep
[2:07:10] funviking99: no
[2:07:52] WolfSpirit80: mine says it gives fragments
[2:08:02] s7wede: I'm guessing that we are going to get more quests come reset
[2:08:16] BBMezzy: Have you seen that some of the achievements of the meta achievement don't even show either?
[2:08:34] physalis4: I haven't started it yet. Is the event unfinished?
[2:08:48] keyboardturner: search for one like goggle wobble
[2:09:12] invictus_DK: Got the Galleon mount today :)
[2:09:18] NeeK_23: maybe there's stuff unlocked weekly
[2:09:21] Scraggersmeh: this ptr or live?Is
[2:09:22] s7wede: @physalis4 Nobody knows TBH
[2:09:26] havoom01: works as intended haha
[2:09:43] Scraggersmeh: You can really tell the live game team is a skeleton atm.
[2:09:45] Layliah79: @invictus_DK Congrats!!!
[2:09:47] Larkaro: This is going to be one of those patches we dont talk about
[2:09:48] windfrenzy: you can get that achievement
[2:09:49] Iwony: it is there but it does not work with the search for some reason
[2:09:51] keyboardturner: you can only see it on wowhead, you /dance with the goggles on while targetting zenata
[2:09:53] windfrenzy: its just hiden until you get it
[2:09:55] LaMu2560: QA could only hold for a year
[2:10:05] windfrenzy: You gotta dance with the chick while doing those glasses dailies
[2:10:10] viscka_games: other achievements disappeared as well. I was working on fishing 'round the isles and it's gone now
[2:10:20] physalis4: Didn't SL have like 2 devs working on the live game around S4?
[2:10:37] keyboardturner: horde/alliance duplicate i think
[2:10:38] NeeK_23: one for horde one alliance, its bugged
[2:10:39] windfrenzy: one is the horde version one is alliance
[2:10:44] hi_im_kage: one is for horde one is for alliance
[2:10:46] Chesscape: I can see the Goggle Woggle in my achievemants, (have not done it)
[2:10:50] Iwony: yeah THAT problem I also have with the dracthyr awakens all done but no credit
[2:10:53] invictus_DK: @Layliah79 Ty <3
[2:11:07] s7wede: Yeah so farm I only need Tenured Archivist, Goggle wobble and Just one More Thing. I managed to bug out the rest of the requirements with alts since you can just get the item, abandon quest and get it again.

[2:12:11] hi_im_kage: its working now
[2:12:18] Arlaeya: It worked yesterday for me but it's a lot easier when no one is there. Also I did the moth quest on top to shut it up, ha!
[2:12:19] MachoCham: I really should start the big dig
[2:12:32] Lausten: Its the worst mechanic ever, who thought this was better than triangulate archeology?
[2:12:49] s7wede: It works, and you can get Clued In achievement by accepting the quest and abandoning it
[2:12:52] NeeK_23: 3 per week or resets on saturday?
[2:12:57] MachoCham: I can also not say Big Dig without saying it in my head as Excalibur calling a FTR finisher
[2:12:59] Larkaro: I just tried to do the world quest you are on and it broke my game

[2:46:44] physalis4: you can farm genesis motes pretty fast now
[2:46:46] MediumRareOG: I'm glad I farmed some of the ZM mounts like the one from Rhuv. It would suck to farm that now
[2:46:57] MediumRareOG: IIRC it's like 20-25k motes for all pets/mounts
[2:47:47] Layliah79: i still have a few pets to craft in ZM
[2:48:04] Layliah79: but there is an achievement!
[2:48:22] Haestoh: @NeeK_23 I have a couple of chars on Silvermoon. I haven't really touched retail since launch of Dragonflight, just trying to get back into swing of thing
[2:48:28] MediumRareOG: You can buy the proto synthesis pets on the AH too if you wantt to really avoid mote farming
[2:48:46] Layliah79: Still haven't gotten the mount from those random chests in ZM. I'm at near 500 chests opened
[2:49:08] Lausten: Its 18400 according to a highly upvoted wowhead comment
[2:49:36] Haestoh: Also, can we talk about the hype of Pete Dunne return on Smackdown!
[2:49:38] Lausten: I got a run macro for opening the ZM console thing
[2:49:43] MediumRareOG: @Lausten so i was close
[2:50:05] Lausten: @MediumRareOG I gussed 50k, so I was far off LUL
[2:50:06] Iwony: Protoform Synthesis Field Journal is the best addon for mounts and pets in Zereth
[2:50:28] Layliah79: Reins of the Sundered Zerethsteed from Mawsworn Cache Treasure
[2:50:41] BBMezzy: I hear the Diglet and Dugtrio chant once again, time to get to work
[2:50:49] Layliah79: one day i'll park a toon out there to open them again Dx
[2:51:02] Shrenko: how much does Zygor cost?
[2:51:36] chefdejour82: Ebyssian dragon form looks amazing

[2:52:14] Shrenko: been farming soooo many achievements lately wondering if Zygor is worth it :D
[2:52:17] kfa2kfa: zygor is with subs ... :(
[2:52:29] MediumRareOG: The Sundered Zerethsteed requires a component from Sephulcher, which is why I don't have it
[2:52:30] WochiTV: hopefully yes
[2:52:33] Shrenko: I think we get NADA today! 😭
[2:52:36] elderratt: guys what time is the 10.2.6 news?
[2:52:39] Layliah79: Twitch drop starts tomorrow too
[2:52:43] SlithTheSivak: i want my pirate ship
[2:53:07] Layliah79: we will get the new weekly memo right?
[2:53:14] michaelmm: I think we'll get something. I do wonder if they will PTR the 10.2.6 content or keep i under wraps and just PTR the season 4 stuff in a few weeks.
[2:53:43] WochiTV: not that i am aware
[2:53:49] BBMezzy: Season 4 dungeons were tested yea

[2:54:00] WochiTV: dungeons because there were megadungeons to test
[2:54:04] WochiTV: not the raid i think
[2:54:09] Layliah79: i'm expecting all the S4 dungeons to be DF dungeons
[2:54:19] WochiTV: @Layliah79 im hoping too
[2:54:33] WochiTV: make sense to end in DF
[2:54:42] Shrenko: Nokhud offensive WutFace
[2:54:44] WochiTV: that worked well in th epast
[2:54:50] Layliah79: I liked NOkhud!
[2:54:52] WochiTV: @Shrenko rubylife pools
[2:55:02] Layliah79: i have the portals for all DF dungeons so i'm fine with it.
[2:55:07] BBMezzy: I don't have the season 1 portals and I'm also not looking forward to a DF dungeon rehash for season 4
[2:55:07] Shrenko: @WochiTV stop NotLikeThis !!!
[2:55:09] michaelmm: Personally I only enjoyed 2 of the DF dungeons - not super looking forwards to a all DF season.
[2:55:21] Layliah79: When they make portal account-wide - they will need to make new rewards cause eventually there will be nothing to do 20s for
[2:55:23] WochiTV: ruby life and afflicted @Shrenko :D

[2:55:33] Shrenko: 😭 😭 😭
[2:55:43] michaelmm: Season 3 has been IMO the best M+, season ever - it could feel like a huge regression for me.
[2:55:45] WochiTV: they didnt mention the pool of dungeons
[2:55:56] BBMezzy: In interviews they've stated revisiting the DF dungeons for s4
[2:56:03] WochiTV: season 3 was one of the best true
[2:56:05] Layliah79: I really enjoy the super old skool dungeons in M+
[2:56:09] michaelmm: The didn't say what dungeons on the roadmap - we just know it's all SL from a dev interview.
[2:56:10] physalis4: this M+ season has been pretty good
[2:56:26] michaelmm: My guess is it will be the first 8 - they seem to be settling on 8 dungeons per season.
[2:56:29] NeeK_23: for every people who hates a dungeon set, theres another who loves it
[2:56:32] Layliah79: If you were on NA - I'd help you get all your portals!

[2:58:12] Lausten: Gotta be some big miffy runners here that can boost him
[2:58:16] Shrenko: BFA is the most buggy expansion....
[2:58:47] Shrenko: revisited after faction changing from horde. It was a nightmare doing BFA content again after a faction change, allmost everything is bugged and phased out
[2:59:07] albuquerquez_joze: Hello, i want to start doing all campaigns, what is the best way to do it? do i need an addon to track? good content!
[2:59:22] neverbornlucky: thought MrGm would be playing palworld like everyone else
[2:59:25] Lausten: Im the exact same, im at 1857 score right now, have done a few 20s without ever stepping foot in M+ this season, all just cause I got 3k score guildies so we get instant invite lol
[3:00:19] Zuldak: stormsong to me will always be where i did the bee grind
[3:00:32] Redivna: you can track progress with the achievements in the game @albuquerquez_joze especially if you do them with a new character
[3:00:33] Xesol: i have a hard time seeing the point in going above 2500
[3:00:42] cikz_cs: this season is ridiculously easy
[3:00:50] Zuldak: yeah it was a super super small mini patch and horde were salty it was only for alliance
[3:00:51] michaelmm: I think the Bee was a patch 8.2.5 thing.
[3:01:03] Lausten: @Xesol Top 1% of what ever get a title right?
[3:01:05] NeeK_23: M+ is fun for some, so they do it for the challenge
[3:01:08] albuquerquez_joze: @Redivna thanks, but u nedd to lock level 59?
[3:01:08] magemaster225: I thought I remember bee grind being alliance only and horde were mad
[3:01:26] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:01:27] Xesol: @Lausten yeah i think so but is it really worth the grind? lol
[3:01:29] Engram08: @Lausten 0.1%
[3:01:31] Haestoh: Question to everyone. How did you all decide what class you want to main? I've played pretty much every class over the past 15 years and done every role and now can't seem to narrow it down and don't have time to commit to more than 1 mrgmFine mrgmFine mrgmFine
[3:01:32] cikz_cs: i came back to wow after a 1,5 years and i had the mount in about 2 weeks
[3:01:39] Shrenko: ohh zygor has a monthly sub? :(
[3:01:49] NeeK_23: M+ is 90% experience and confident
[3:02:26] Arlaeya: Easy...I like rogues in everything else I play so that's my main, but I also like to see all sides, so... lots of alts
[3:02:31] MediumRareOG: I enjoy playing hunter. other people prefer being wrong
[3:02:31] Zuldak: i have the mechanics of a half dead jellyfish so i play guardian druid
[3:02:35] Shrenko: my main is hunter and I played it for years.. I dont play on alts, only if I need them for some achievements etc. But I put so much time into my hunter that I feel like I cant abandon it and hunter is always a good choice when it comes to endgame content @imjoeski
[3:02:37] Redivna: hmm, I don't think you have to @albuquerquez_joze I've seen people lock the level at 59, but I think it's up to you
[3:02:37] JakeSezz: I committed to Prot Pally cuz I’m supposed to keep aggro so all those times I accidentally pulled aggro as a previous-Mage main, are now supposed to happen jakese1LUL mrgmHehe
[3:02:40] Layliah79: Paladin is my main - but I enjoy the other classes a lot while doing my farms and such for collections
[3:02:59] Haestoh: Everything literally has its ups and downs and I'm so indecisive about what I want to pick olbirdGderp
[3:03:03] NeeK_23: im 100% a ranged caster, but dabbled in healing this season. Melee is not my style
[3:03:12] BBMezzy: @MrGM Right so halfway through the rep, nearly 70k currency and no reward for reaching rank 3 either
[3:03:19] databob1: I play everything but I main DK
[3:03:21] Layliah79: Hekili Priority Helper is a GREAT addon for anyone learning a new class/spec.
[3:03:22] physalis4: Where does the quest start for Bel'ameth?
[3:03:31] Shrenko: yeah you can run so fast as a hunter too, really good for farming
[3:03:48] databob1: not healers though
[3:03:51] Zuldak: maybe the real reward are the archivist friends you make along the way
[3:04:22] spadetrex: ptr when ?
[3:04:25] MediumRareOG: i'm sick of rep grinds
[3:04:40] magemaster225: its probably just a grind for the meta achievement, but I do hope you get the hat at the end and its not something they forgot
[3:04:43] NeeK_23: idk I find hunter unsatisfying to play. I want to collect the pets but its not for me. At least I can collect Warlock pets now kind of

[3:13:41] calphan84: did you see they got rid of shiny pet charms?
[3:14:12] Arlaeya: Yeah all charms are polished charms
[3:14:14] calphan84: yeah shiny was the old ones from mist and wod
[3:14:21] NeeK_23: are you tracking toys? there a toy from Tortolan cache thats annoying to get
[3:14:26] magemaster225: they should add pet battles with guns
[3:14:29] MediumRareOG: shiny pet charms were up until WoD? Legion? and it was polished pet charms after
[3:14:43] michaelmm: The shiny ones were replaced by Polished charms in BfA.  It looks like they have combined them now.
[3:14:49] MediumRareOG: honestly i didn't know they got rid of shiny pet charms. it might explain why i got polished pet charms in the mail and didn't know why
[3:15:00] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:15:02] NeeK_23: BFA 8.3 had the last pet battle dungeon, but it was the end of a mini story they had. nothing new since apart from worldquests
[3:15:11] Lausten: They made new ones cause people were literally swimming in them, so new pets was just bought instantly
[3:15:12] spadetrex: i get massive spike when mouse over on rarity at minimap any idea why ?
[3:15:41] Shrenko: @spadetrex I think thats normal
[3:15:46] magemaster225: rarity always causes spikes, same like hovering over the menu button
[3:15:51] Lausten: Yeah Rarity loads way too much stuff when moused over
[3:16:16] NeeK_23: I do it every few months to try and get the Family Battler achievement, but they can be so tough if you dont have the exact combo of pets
[3:16:16] michaelmm: Rarity has a huge tooltip. Addons run in the same thread as the wow UI so heavy addons can cause the UI to briefly freeze.
[3:16:30] Lausten: I use MiniMapButtonBag to put my icons into a bag I gotta open to not get the accidental spike
[3:17:01] michaelmm: it tracks kill counts. It's quire complex as there's so many different things it has to track.
[3:17:04] magemaster225: some of it is tracking the stats page but it has its own tracker so if you redo addons or use a diff computer it wont save
[3:17:35] Shrenko: what the... my Goggle wobble achievement dissapeared from my achievement tab. Can you see it in yours @MrGM ? I feel like the achievement tab is quite buggy after the new patch
[3:17:44] Lausten: Or frustrating knowing that you're the 1% outlier that still havent gotten a mount
[3:18:06] Shrenko: but I saw it earlier today, now its poof gone xD
[3:18:06] NeeK_23: I can see it as Alliance
[3:18:13] Layliah79: Rarity will give you a "achievement" prompt on your screen and it will screen shot it all. So if you like being able to share screenshots when you loot rare items.
[3:18:16] Chesscape: No, I'm Alliance, I can see the achieve
[3:18:19] neverbornlucky: we horde are better then alliance
[3:18:39] Shrenko: @neverbornlucky cohhSus
[3:19:02] havoom01: better at what? cooking? using the mop to clean?
[3:19:35] NeeK_23: btw the area there is where you can farm the mount if you really want to
[3:19:36] Lausten: Did you faction cahnge that charater
[3:19:41] neverbornlucky: Blood Elfs are better then night elfs MrGm don't make us burn down that new tree
[3:19:45] maxfoxartz: Greetings @mrgm . How are you?
[3:19:51] Lausten: Cause that ususally fucks up stuff like that
[3:20:02] Shrenko: @Lausten I noticed
[3:20:11] maxfoxartz: Doing good, thanks
[3:20:16] spadetrex: guess i should use sexy map to get rid of rarity on my mini map :D
[3:20:32] Lausten: I only ever faction swapped my main and I'll never do it again, fuck that shit..
[3:20:36] allthatidontknow: miss those bfa zones they were so good
[3:20:48] Layliah79: that's cool! i manually disable each mini map icon lol
[3:20:58] neverbornlucky: Msi Claw is coming
[3:21:00] Shrenko: I have the achievement to complete all daily fishing quest in Thunder Bluff as Alliance .... my achievement tab is so bugged right now xD
[3:21:42] NeeK_23: cross faction achievements seem to be the main broken ones
[3:21:51] Xesol: does anyone know if quest rewards with warbands will be account wide? like if i complete something on plate will i get the cloth mog?
[3:22:26] LuiBMHunter: LuiBMHunter subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 6 month streak! For the Hoard
[3:22:27] NeeK_23: there's that warband loot thing too, that wasnt quite clear
[3:22:36] allthatidontknow: its interesting they chose earthen as an allied race, wonder if we'll see nerubians by expansions end
[3:22:43] JaviHeals: Lets hope not
[3:22:47] LuiBMHunter: not bad thx - yourself?
[3:23:08] michaelmm: Whats eems to have happened is that Alliance Achives are being treated as horde and vice versa.  My theory is they are working on the next step of removing  alliance/horde barriers and it's causing some issues.
[3:23:08] JaviHeals: Im just really looking forward to being able to run dungeons / raids and get all the tmogs. for a alt lunatic like myself it's perfect
[3:23:17] Shrenko: we didnt need ANOTHER dwarf race... they look awesome though
[3:23:24] WochiTV: is from pulp fiction
[3:23:26] JaviHeals: Same with reps... I have like all my BFA reps on one char, all WoD on another etc -_-
[3:23:30] WochiTV: samuel l jackson
[3:23:32] Zuldak: I would love Naga with a high elf visage
[3:23:43] JaviHeals: Im aware that reps will only be TWW to start tho :(
[3:24:37] WochiTV: is fixed now

[3:36:43] Iwony: yes
[3:36:46] Arlaeya: Yes
[3:36:54] NeeK_23: clear hydrated, dark, dehydrated
[3:36:55] Vesamora: clear=hydrated, maybe overly so
[3:37:00] Iwony: means your kidneys washed it all out
[3:37:04] Ookami7113: flushed out system
[3:37:14] Arlaeya: no, lol! it IS possible to drink too much but the amount you have to drink is rediculous
[3:37:14] MachoCham: You want it to be straw coloured
[3:37:40] Iwony: well you can even drink too much so ....
[3:37:49] Iwony: there is actual water poisinging
[3:38:14] MachoCham: The whole 8 glasses of water a day that is preached? It was a study backed by Nestle who sell water.
[3:38:24] Iwony: It happened actually to some ppl after a marathon . drank the wrong water and died from it ...
[3:38:26] MachoCham: Your body regulates itself pretty well
[3:38:32] Iwony: too few minerals
[3:38:39] MachoCham: Yeah
[3:38:55] Vesamora: I used to see that when I was deployed to the middle east. these giant army rangers and navy seals would pass out in the food tent because they drank so much water that they wacked their electrolytes. As soon as they ate some real food their body went NOPE and they passed out
[3:39:09] DevoidX: wait until you hear about where the '5 fruit and veg portions' comes from...
[3:39:35] Vesamora: gallons
[3:39:41] MachoCham: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html
[3:39:54] Harai_Ulfsark: guess we can continue eating fried chicken with soda
[3:40:02] Vesamora: yeah I'm not saying you would be in that state ever, but it just can happen and people don't really realize it
[3:40:10] Iwony: oh man you can post urls.... do
[3:40:15] Iwony: doh
[3:40:24] Iwony: macho
[3:40:31] DevoidX: yup
[3:40:36] Vesamora: korean fried chicken and coke sounds insanely good right now, even at 9:20 AM
[3:40:38] michaelmm: The 8 glasses comes from the idea the body loses about 2 litres of water a day. Thing is we get most of our water from food which is often >50% water.
[3:40:42] magemaster225: yeah the food pyramid is bunk
[3:41:13] magemaster225: the nutrition facts also havent been updated since the 50s, it was only developed to show you how much to prevent scurvy
[3:41:20] Iwony: best is don't overdo anything
[3:41:28] michaelmm: Eating loads of veg is a good thing but there's no scientific evidence that 5 portions is the "right" amount. It's just a political soundbite.
[3:42:01] MachoCham: only 6min
[3:42:24] DevoidX: yes, some newspaper asked a governemnt doctor how much furit and veg and he basically made it up on the spot and the rest is history...
[3:42:25] jiveyivey: As someone who didn’t finish their Nutritional Science degree, the entire food industry is fucking insane. Bunk Studies, Paid off Doctors, Anecdotal old-wives-tales, etc. It’s honestly exhausting to try and parse through lol

[3:46:47] Implied_Slight: it was a good video LUL
[3:47:00] NeeK_23: the EVE war stories are better than the game, the game is so slow and dense
[3:47:10] Krenn_: i watched a 6 and a half hour video about just season 5 of the tv show lost
[3:47:33] Vesamora: @Zuldak what is the name of the channel if you don't mind? My dad would love that too

[3:49:32] Zuldak: they also go over the interwar period like the russian civil war
[3:50:00] MachoCham: The issue I guess with those retrospective is being impartial and not just repeating what we know as the victors
[3:50:31] Lausten: History is indeed written by the victors
[3:50:52] MachoCham: Oooh new dark side of the ring was announced

[3:51:57] calphan84: i think theyy are it's under the channel biography is all i know
[3:52:04] NeeK_23: I find the WWE produced docs tend to be so sanitised/censored, that they dont engage much
[3:52:10] manlywilliammarsh: met jake and he said some wild stuff in the middle of the ring during a show. it was crazy
[3:52:58] magemaster225: have you watched itron claw yet
[3:53:23] Zuldak: being a WWE star would be hard because so many kids watch you

[4:05:08] Lausten: Not worth spending money on
[4:05:21] lexrayspextv: Question. Where would you start if you wanted to get a desktop system? UK based. You got somewhere you go or did you build it yourself? My old system is 13 generations old….
[4:05:28] Lausten: You'll open it once and then realise its all nostalgia
[4:05:33] chelfx: They are releasing vol 2 with bunch  other MG games
[4:05:38] MachoCham: @lexrayspextv watch this space in a few days
[4:06:01] S3N71: Scan is good, PC Specialist too
[4:06:14] NuttyNatsu: I went with PC specialist for mine
[4:06:34] MachoCham: @Demeternoth got one built before her but I can't remember where from
[4:06:54] NeeK_23: @MachoCham didnt she have issues though
[4:06:59] NuttyNatsu: I planned on building mine myself, but my anxiety went nope not happening
[4:07:04] NeeK_23: 100% yes it is
[4:07:22] Zuldak: is what soloable? sorry i was getting coffee
[4:07:31] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[4:07:41] Lausten: Think you just need high enough dps to not have it reset or something
[4:08:02] Lausten: Yeah there is some mindcontrol I think
[4:08:06] Zuldak: there is a bit of a dps check but yes it is on lfr and normal.
[4:08:12] Zuldak: you need to be able to burn it before the MC
[4:08:15] NeeK_23: Ghun is the only one not soloable now I think.
[4:08:28] chelfx: Ny'alotha you need the cloak
[4:08:33] Zuldak: you cant get to ghuun because the boss before him has instant MC mechanics
[4:09:02] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:09:12] Zuldak: i draw the line at mythic ashvane in EP as soloable right now save for specific fights with MC mechanics
[4:09:49] Zuldak: nyalotha crap just has a bunch of hp and its annoying. Also carapace is hard to solo
[4:10:13] NeeK_23: the twin bosses in EP might also be impossible due to damage reduction when next to each other
[4:10:56] Zuldak: ashvane and oozoga or however you spell it both have hard dps checks. You have to be able ot break ashvane's shield and for the jellyfish you have to be able to push phase before 10 stacks instantly kills
[4:11:04] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Hello!
[4:11:09] Zuldak: but yeah then you have court which is 100% unsoloable
[4:11:19] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: FInally home earlier enough to caught you.
[4:11:22] Zuldak: the council in BOD is also basically unsoloable

[4:15:24] NeeK_23: I'd like to see a return of mini raids
[4:15:57] Lausten: They got shared health
[4:16:14] Zuldak: they do NOt share HP need to dps together
[4:16:27] Zuldak: the debuff lowers max hp
[4:16:30] Zuldak: by %
[4:17:05] magemaster225: it was a ballache when it was current content, and the kiss curse items were bad
[4:17:12] Lausten: It was one of the harder raids ever made wasnt it?
[4:17:20] adampanerabread: yo
[4:17:58] adampanerabread: you need to use one of the weapons to kill it right?
[4:18:02] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: What is your iLevel here?
[4:18:04] magemaster225: helya was the better mini raid
[4:18:13] Zuldak: this was a weird raid because many top guilds declined to even do a RWF for it
[4:18:40] Zuldak: yes you just slap em
[4:19:04] Zuldak: no he's just phasing
[4:20:02] Zuldak: got to interrupt the heal
[4:21:24] Pandachoww: its an "undying guardian"....clue's in the name ;) lol
[4:21:43] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: A lot of the BFA dungeons confuse me.

[4:24:21] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I need to get that one.

[4:25:08] indecisivewisp: even if they announce that its a future feature
[4:25:17] Pandachoww: i reckon someone bigs gonna die
[4:25:28] indecisivewisp: @Zuldak cruel cruel thing lol
[4:25:30] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I wish they'd open up more follower dungeons.

[4:26:23] Pandachoww: its a movie
[4:26:23] chelfx: thats a pretty good movie
[4:26:25] Lausten: They wont ever do that, is a "back of the box" feature sadly..
[4:26:30] NeeK_23: Ive seen it, its decent, nothing special
[4:26:37] Pandachoww: watched it the other week and feel like it was way overhyped
[4:26:55] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Tyrande gacked Nathanos.  Mal going back to sleep would be fair.
[4:27:03] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:27:20] HiddenSquid188: oh, for the announcement will be all races can play all classes @mrgm 😉
[4:27:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Oh, revenge.
[4:27:44] chelfx: does it have to have a point?
[4:27:46] NeeK_23: revenge, hurting Sylvanas
[4:27:49] magemaster225: well she wanted to ultimately kill sylvanas
[4:27:51] Layliah79: get rid of Sylvanas #1 guy
[4:27:52] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: For the tree.
[4:27:52] indecisivewisp: other than a goading to sylvanas
[4:27:53] Arlaeya: "For Teldrassil"
[4:27:55] Lausten: He was a war criminal hunted down
[4:27:58] indecisivewisp: that she killed him
[4:28:00] Elrathir: I guess he just died, which is satisfying for us
[4:28:04] Zuldak: technically we never actually saw her kill Nathanos
[4:28:12] Layliah79: technically wasn't Nathanos already dead?!
[4:28:13] Iwony: you killed my ppl now I kill your beloved
[4:28:14] Layliah79: :D
[4:28:28] Harai_Ulfsark: shadowlands being rewritten before launch theory
[4:28:35] Arlaeya: the fact that he was probably in the Maw too and the Jailer didnt' say anyting to Sylvanas is still unresolved.
[4:28:44] JakeSezz: Nathanos & Malfurion are equally annoying and I’m just over em both
[4:28:48] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I mean the Ardenweald cinematic was "I'll take your head just like I took his.  Oh, you didn't know? Your master is keeping secrets...."
[4:28:48] Zuldak: oh i 100% believe a lot of the SL story was being rewritten on the fly
[4:28:55] indecisivewisp: @Harai_Ulfsark chronicle 4 on its way to retcon it lol
[4:29:16] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I really liked Nathanos.
[4:29:25] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I mean, Knight of Sarcasm.
[4:29:36] Layliah79: maybe she finds him while she's doing her time in the Maw
[4:29:37] CanielD: Maybe they kept his head alive
[4:29:39] Arlaeya: I believe for loyalists for the Forsaken heritage, she says she's looking for his soul still
[4:29:48] Iwony: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm wut? he was an asshole
[4:29:50] CanielD: made him a headless horsemen type character
[4:30:23] Zuldak: he was a character with personality. I liked him even if he was a jerk
[4:30:23] indecisivewisp: he had the cool undead model
[4:30:24] Implied_Slight: if he didn't go to the maw, or shadowlands, then where did he go HahaThink
[4:30:44] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Asshole? Yeah.  But he had that quip that was perfect.  And he even sassed Sylvanas during the DH Lgeion unveiling to normal characters.
[4:30:46] indecisivewisp: i would love it yeah
[4:30:50] Arlaeya: You can go kill birds for him on Eon's Fringe if it's his day. He...hate birds
[4:31:08] keyboardturner: ion's fringe
[4:31:10] Samiccus: Im still wondering if we will get Undead born from the light like Calia Menethil
[4:31:27] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:31:45] Samiccus: A fellow Sam!
[4:31:55] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Hi bee Dad!
[4:31:56] lexrayspextv: what expansions and content have you 100%
[4:31:57] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[4:32:07] Zuldak: i read a pretty long thread on twitter going over why Calia is rejected by a lot of forsaken players. Namely because she has never actually been forsaken by anyone. Calia is welcomed everywhere
[4:32:15] Samiccus: What is up man! <3
[4:32:21] indecisivewisp: im hoping we get broken customisation for the draenei heritage
[4:33:00] Samiccus: lol thanks I appreciate that!
[4:33:12] Samiccus: on that MrGM grind!
[4:33:12] indecisivewisp: she swears on her menethil name yeah
[4:33:15] keyboardturner: "on my word as a menethil" or something KEKW
[4:33:18] Zuldak: 'i give my word as a menethis' uhh...
[4:33:20] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I'm a bit annoyed by Calia, but only because she just popped into game.  Until I finally read the books a few weeks ago, I didn't know how she became undead.  WoW should have let that be in game.
[4:33:22] indecisivewisp: not sure i would be boasting about that tbh
[4:33:53] indecisivewisp: @Elkhuntsman yea!
[4:34:12] magemaster225: they should have calia be a double agent for the light and let lillian voss be forsaken leader
[4:34:22] Lausten: Theres quests about it in BFA
[4:34:30] Zuldak: yeah she was a priest order hall follower lady.
[4:34:38] Samiccus: Ya I think that was her first real in-game appearance was the priest order hall
[4:34:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: She was.  It was like Live Priest.  Then next time I saw her Undead priest.
[4:34:55] Arlaeya: Yes, she was. but the story of how she dies and is brought back is in Before the Storm
[4:35:02] Samiccus: I still think the events from BEFORE THE STORM should have happened in game
[4:35:04] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I was HOOOOWWW???
[4:35:09] Samiccus: that was too much to happen in a book
[4:35:09] Zuldak: yeah she snuck into a meeting between forsaken and their human families and when she was discovered sylvanas freaked out and killed everyone
[4:35:24] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I totally agree BtS.
[4:35:28] lexrayspextv: you got a lot of your specs?
[4:35:40] lexrayspextv: computer specs
[4:35:56] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The book was good.  But not every player reads the books/has the time/money/etc.
[4:35:57] lexrayspextv: yes
[4:36:56] chelfx: Did you watch the marvels?
[4:37:13] chelfx: i just watched it last night
[4:37:22] calphan84: i liked the marvels personally
[4:37:32] chelfx: i think its better than people make it out to be
[4:37:56] slambitz: agreed rushed but not as bad as youtubers made it out to be
[4:38:00] Samiccus: Felt very Last Season of GAME OF THRONES esq
[4:38:09] Zuldak: disney has lost a lot of money on films this year. The indiana jones movie was a flop too
[4:38:12] Samiccus: good stories but i wanted more

[4:39:48] chelfx: WOAH
[4:40:09] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I have to see Loki s.2 but 1 was awesome.
[4:40:12] Necoc: no Indiana Jones, huge touchstone missed there
[4:40:26] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I'll be sluggish so it's my fault with the Marvels.
[4:40:47] chelfx: its gonna be in secert wars

[4:46:08] AstralKiwi0292: that statement summarises  most of wow imho

[4:52:16] Zuldak: well at least you have a guide on how to get the mount
[4:52:17] Nativ_TV: Thats what you call a scam @adampanerabread
[4:52:21] chelfx: @databob1 youtube/twitch i beleive devolore is the channel
[4:52:22] Karn1987: ya
[4:52:22] Nativ_TV: @MrGM
[4:52:25] keyboardturner: it is
[4:52:29] havoom01: yea they are
[4:52:40] Zuldak: It's some next level timeways meddling when you make a guide on how to get a mount and then 5 years later you use it to get the mount
[4:52:54] Lausten: Thats why I wont ever do anything on the beta, I feel bad when I get the thing I've been hunting for in retail for ever
[4:53:10] Nativ_TV: Yea I mean making a guide for mount you never got xD its funny xD funny scam
[4:53:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I can't recall why you're burning the wood.

[4:55:02] OpiumHC: Hi, just passing by and wanted to thank you for your awesome videos. Good luck on your 100% Completing WoW. Cheers
[4:55:08] Zuldak: the season 4 BFA mount for KSM
[4:55:13] MediumRareOG: i got the mail muncher on my 3rd try
[4:55:37] Nativ_TV: I've been away from WoW almost 2 years tbh, I will probably come back to TWW
[4:56:01] Zuldak: Awakened Mindborer was the mount. idk if it shows if you dont have it
[4:56:17] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I need to figure out the connection between the Jade Serpent and the MoP dragons and the Dragon Isles dragons.  I mean the Jade Dragon is awesome; just a different timeline to renew.  (Thought of it when you mentioned the serpent like mounts)
[4:56:25] CanielD: It would take a lot for war within to be worse than BFA
[4:56:28] Nativ_TV: I think you should make a guide on TWW beta on how to get a mount and than never get it on live
[4:56:31] Zuldak: I like the Falcor mount D:
[4:57:20] MediumRareOG: blizzard doesn't put any thought into connecting MoP and the dragon isles. At best they'll retcon something later
[4:57:25] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I there has to be a connection.  Just like cousins or something.
[4:57:25] Zuldak: Im so worried the book mount from the mage tower isnt going to get dynamic flying. Worked so hard to get the stupid thing
[4:57:27] Nativ_TV: I only use 2 mounts all the time
[4:57:38] Big_Rum: Hello My friend! How the heck are you? Was your weekend in London wonderful?
[4:57:46] Karn1987: the jade srepent is a wild god like the other 3
[4:57:50] CanielD: already confirmed i think
[4:58:06] Elrathir: dynamic flying for my mechagon peacekeeper please
[4:58:06] HiddenSquid188: coming into this late who did you roll to do bfa?
[4:58:06] Nativ_TV: I just use big blizzard bear and x-51 nether rocket x-treme, the rocket because it is small and doesn't cover the whole screen, and big blizzard bear is just pog
[4:58:07] michaelmm: I assume the slither drake animation kit could be used for cloud serpents.
[4:58:29] Necoc: wasn't there a drop or something happening this week? or am i misremembering
[4:58:43] keyboardturner: maybe they mean what character / class you were playing during BFA
[4:59:43] Zuldak: im a druid and i dont use mounts. But i have over 800 of em. I just think they are neat

[5:02:51] Layliah79: True! Mount and Monday both started with M so i rolled with it KEKW
[5:02:52] Zuldak: so 889 is the highest?
[5:02:54] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I've got a good base.  I still need to run Strat back door a lot more.
[5:03:09] guga_official: 903 here
[5:03:14] Iwony: I get most ofd them and never ever use them^^

[5:06:41] chelfx: i think friday is the new friday
[5:06:43] calphan84: monday is like friday for me because i am off tuesday and wednesday night

[5:09:35] Necoc: manuscript?

[5:12:19] chefdejour82: the event
[5:12:22] chelfx: i think the systems are test
[5:12:33] Layliah79: Could be!
[5:12:40] Lausten: @Layliah79 Hopefully one day it will be on your account instead of having to worry about characters.. 🤞
[5:12:50] Harai_Ulfsark: the totem one is the worst
[5:13:03] Layliah79: @Lausten yes!!!! a girl can hope cause OCD can be a buzzkiller lol
[5:13:08] keyboardturner: totem one needs work
[5:13:43] xpsha: sorry about the other day with the message when you saw the message hello cheeky my mate typed that on my phone, do love your wow content though when I need some news
[5:13:43] keyboardturner: i think they shoudl replace the action bar with something similar to the dragonriding action bar and stop making us click objects, just use spell abilities instead
[5:13:47] Lausten: A UI instead of a totem you are 2 steps away from so you gotta stutter step arround to do it
[5:14:03] Zuldak: time to open up your F12s
[5:14:43] xpsha: yeah it was that yeah
[5:14:53] Lausten: @keyboardturner Yeah the issue is the mouse movement, to click the totem
[5:14:56] keyboardturner: i mean, you can just exit the vehicle just like you do for dragonriding
[5:15:11] Zuldak: i think they need to fix the bug of dragonriding deceleration in the old zones when you transition from one zone to another
[5:15:14] Big_Rum: Dan what Character is this? wheres the hunmter?
[5:15:24] xpsha: do you have all glories raiders done?
[5:15:28] Big_Rum: ahh
[5:15:37] Lausten: What happens if you delete the googles? :O
[5:16:06] Harai_Ulfsark: im happy dracthyr soar now work with dragonriding, still i wish it was its own full mount transformation, my dracthyr is a double gatherer and i still need to use a stupid mount to collect stuff :(
[5:16:08] keyboardturner: your rep resets to 0
[5:16:08] xpsha: I used to do like 3 raiders a day over Christmas tbf quite enjoy them when you get a good team
[5:16:17] Lausten: You're the MrGM, you test stuff, you better test it Kappa
[5:17:01] Iwony: It is like the Day when Deathwing came in basic
[5:17:09] xpsha: I went from 400-460 since I started running keystones and the latest content more than the old content my ilvl gone through the roof
[5:17:12] Harai_Ulfsark: she gives you new goggles once you approach the WQ again
[5:17:55] keyboardturner: maybe that's what the max rep reward is.. you use them anywhere without WQs :p
[5:17:55] Lausten: They need someone to teach them not to make items for your bags but small UIs for features like this, especially if its a thing going forward, same with all the  secret items we got in our bags, if they had been in a journal it would have been perfect
[5:18:12] xpsha: some people are 480 on multiple characters with myth rated gear I’m like don’t have time for that lol
