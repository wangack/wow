[0:50:03] vanillasky7888: IDDD
[0:50:05] vanillasky7888: SOO TRUE
[0:50:06] farmpapi: peak was wotlk, cata flopped the game
[0:50:06] vanillasky7888: SWIUFTY
[0:50:08] vanillasky7888: NO
[0:50:09] Calithief: cata was wack

[0:50:12] MartianPK: This website says last 4 months have been 1mil players until this month went up to 2mil.  Idk how accurate that is
[0:50:20] Niksen_99: Cata PVP was good
[0:50:20] Seidrrr: It was wotlk hype that got the Cata to peak and yes then it went down, especially when pandaria came out.
[0:50:21] vanillasky7888: CATA RUINED THE GAME
[0:50:22] Calithief: lich king was the last good arena seasons
[0:50:41] QuickCez: i mean cata was fantastic untill last raid that was bad and last tooooooo long
[0:50:44] Seidrrr: Cata had the best pvp
[0:51:02] Dan29zz: Swifty you started playing since vanilla ?
[0:51:05] vanillasky7888: CATA WAS AWFUL
[0:51:06] Calithief: lich king did
[0:51:11] vanillasky7888: RUINED THE GAME
[0:51:13] Cennx: eh i had fun doing rag]
[0:51:19] Calithief: cata was the downfall
[0:51:31] tehtehcre: wotlk best pvp
[0:51:32] Sybokk: I liked Cata, pvp was fun
[0:51:34] Parru030: I Think my "Fun" stopped to doing raids and everyone was gone in the gaming world, i mean leveling etc
[0:51:36] Boucher86: Cata was garbage
[0:51:41] ungryniko: i doubt they do cata classic
[0:51:55] Niksen_99: Think it depends how WOTLK Classic will go
[0:52:01] Sybokk: sure! they will MoP after that ^^
[0:52:08] Parru030: It was the Damn "Flying"!
[0:52:17] MonkikoBytes: I feel like WOTLK was the last generally liked expansion and all the subsequent expansions were very dvisive
[0:52:18] Calithief: bro swifty was hype during pre bc when he realesed that warrior video
[0:52:22] Niksen_99: Could see them go all the way to legion lol
[0:52:26] MonkikoBytes: divisive*
[0:52:33] Syylar1N: evening

[0:53:05] Cookehs: i never played wrath but i started in cata and liked it and miss it
[0:53:07] Blackminuz: cataclysm your guides there helped me to love warrior :p
[0:53:08] coastalhappiness: Priest is the best class in wotlk imo
[0:53:10] Calithief: BC was the best
[0:53:21] th3b3astcj: whats your opinion of the Twitch Update for April 20th?

[0:58:15] Valinthe: necro holy is pretty good in pve
[0:58:30] Maria_Neefay: MOP was where WoW dominated Twitch back in the day, all of the biggest streamers were WoW players at that time
[0:58:55] TheEndIsNear777: i haven't healed in years but i would always click to target someone for heal
[0:59:03] Parru030: is there still gaming houses Swifty?
[0:59:11] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[0:59:40] clickvoodoo: do you think they will do another graphics revamp like in wow at some stage?
[0:59:47] clickvoodoo: wod*
[0:59:51] Seidrrr: Considering that Twitch was released in 2011 and mop came out 2012, not much else to stream wowise
[0:59:55] neonn984: TBC is seeing lots of activity, on 2 servers

[1:01:05] Moss_Wart: you don't have the gaming house anymore?
[1:01:17] Inflex873: what will happen with your all wow collection?
[1:01:28] Sacrallys: Unreal 5 graphics might just be too expensive for an MMO, unfortunately.
[1:01:28] vitriol38: that's a single player it's easier to it
[1:01:35] Parru030: Because online game is diffirent store that singleplayer
[1:01:44] vitriol38: alout more complex in a mmorpg
[1:01:51] neonn984: @Swifty if you want TBC on your NE Warrior, you have to move over to Benediction from Faerelina
[1:01:51] 1sinnerman: imagine the lag ingame with all those graphics :)
[1:01:57] Maria_Neefay: And I remember your peak as a streamer was around the MOP expansion, because the expansion was really good and you could make such a great content out of it
[1:02:13] Parru030: You just nees so much more stress
[1:02:23] clickvoodoo: you should use your connections to push for a wow2 unreal engine 5
[1:02:32] krazybaz: they lowerr the graphic so more people can play it.. not everyone can afford a 3k $ computer
[1:02:34] Seidrrr: Microsoft needs to light a fire under blizzards butt, this slowest developer in the world can't last much longer.
