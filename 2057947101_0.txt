[6:14:55] chillie113: Sadge
[6:15:18] kenpachie11: is it true that dakui  got gkicked for being better than the officers at the game?
[6:15:47] talys90: @kenpachie11 my old trollo peepoCute
[6:15:51] grillparty1992: now serious talk, theres no way they'll redo all old raids right? and redo all gear? last phase is probably their new karazhan crypts and old raids will maybe get extra health? theres no shot they give you new gear
[6:16:47] grillparty1992: to be honest they have invested more time into sod then any retail/classic game versions in the past 6 years
[6:17:05] kenpachie11: u sending icc on monday or tuesday?
[6:18:03] grillparty1992: did u see that payo streamed for 30+ hours? hes still streaming KEKW @laty1337

[6:19:12] kenpachie11: bro even the pond are playing sod
[6:19:12] SwepsGaming: worth doing warrior axe quest at 30?
[6:19:13] kenpachie11: holy shit
[6:19:31] grillparty1992: @kenpachie11 its horrible. its such a fake hype
[6:19:40] grillparty1992: people just bad at the game
[6:19:47] grillparty1992: and sod is perfect for them
[6:19:55] kalleberglol: but not more fun than ravager
[6:20:38] kenpachie11: I know
[6:20:40] grillparty1992: go nap brother, if you have family time tomorrow you go bedge @laty1337
[6:20:41] kenpachie11: been saying that for ages
[6:20:45] kenpachie11: SOD is literally for streamers only
[6:20:47] kenpachie11: same like HC
[6:20:51] talys90: are we doing shots?! im in
[6:21:00] kenpachie11: no shot actual gamers enjoy this shit
[6:21:22] grillparty1992: @kenpachie11 yeah and if streamers play, their viewers come
[6:21:32] grillparty1992: but i think we are wrong
[6:21:38] grillparty1992: cuz its very popular
[6:21:42] kenpachie11: surely
[6:21:44] grillparty1992: so maybe we just hate dadgamers
[6:21:59] kenpachie11: u know it's bad
[6:22:02] kenpachie11: when even laty starting coping
[6:22:06] kenpachie11: calling himself a dad gamer
[6:22:09] kenpachie11: and ahs no wife or kid
[6:22:35] grillparty1992: no laty gave me hope that im sane.. i thought laty will play sod day and night but hes not so much into it
[6:22:44] grillparty1992: so maybe i believe in laty being a gamer
[6:22:47] grillparty1992: and not a dadgamer
[6:22:57] kenpachie11: like I get it, play the occasional 30-45 minutes just to "kill time" but peple min maxing EVERYONE and setting class/gs requirements for dungeons is just beyond me lmao
[6:23:34] grillparty1992: bro
[6:23:38] grillparty1992: its a seasonal game
[6:23:43] kenpachie11: I might've gotten to 40 in like a month, but after seeing the nourish requirements
[6:23:45] grillparty1992: in 6-7 months your chars are gone
[6:23:47] kenpachie11: I ain't touching that shit
[6:23:47] grillparty1992: KEKW
[6:23:55] talys90: @kenpachie11 since to good old GDKP i saw players geared to the MAX but played like shit :D
[6:24:14] grillparty1992: i just hope we get a healthy playerbase for cata
[6:24:15] Lange__84: wtf, you still up
[6:24:19] Lange__84: :D
[6:24:20] grillparty1992: cuz i aint got no time for sod

[6:25:24] grillparty1992: @kenpachie11 lol
[6:25:28] bonyato: peepoHeyy @talys90
[6:25:28] kenpachie11: Only issue about cata imo, is finding a guild that DOESN"T suck but only raids like 1-2 days a week with no split requirements and shit
[6:25:46] talys90: hows it goin @bonyato peepoShy
[6:25:59] kenpachie11: I get it that splits are EFFICIENT but taht shit KILLS me
[6:26:09] grillparty1992: @kenpachie11 my guild raids 2 days a week and so how we cleared all raids
[6:26:16] grillparty1992: it took us 5% for LK
[6:26:18] grillparty1992: to be fair
[6:26:20] kenpachie11: u didn't get me
[6:26:24] kenpachie11: I said it's rare to find such a guild
[6:26:31] bonyato: @talys90 good just worked 12 hrs on 3hrs of sleep and im about to hit level 36 pepeW
[6:26:31] kenpachie11: thus why it's an issue
[6:26:35] kenpachie11: difficult to find those
[6:26:42] grillparty1992: look
[6:26:45] bonyato: but we grind pepeW
[6:26:49] talys90: @bonyato ouhhhh gaymer peepoSex
[6:26:53] grillparty1992: laty can join bing chilling on earthshaker
[6:26:54] grillparty1992: gdkp
[6:26:57] kenpachie11: grillparty sounds NA and alliance idk
[6:26:58] grillparty1992: that will clear
[6:27:01] kenpachie11: maybe were being baited
[6:27:04] grillparty1992: but he hates ES
[6:27:33] Barry74: damn the big 40
[6:27:38] kenpachie11: I look at the gehenas recruitment thingy for cata every week or so
[6:27:45] kenpachie11: 80% is skandinavian guilds
[6:27:47] kenpachie11: it's insane
[6:28:14] grillparty1992: earthshaker is really dead now... loads have transfered to gehennas but we have 5-6 good groups going and if youre good you can raid there
[6:28:15] kenpachie11: I guess we need a dad gamer guild without dads
[6:28:17] talys90: @kenpachie11 skandinavian ppl are cool peepoCute what u have against it
[6:28:17] kenpachie11: damn it
[6:28:17] grillparty1992: so im not worried
[6:28:50] kenpachie11: I dont speak their language talys
[6:28:54] kenpachie11: the fuck am I gonna do
[6:29:00] talys90: yeah me neither KEKL true
[6:29:24] grillparty1992: but @kenpachie11 i agree, good, very good gdkp's can still exist in cata but most will be guilds
[6:29:56] kenpachie11: yeah
[6:29:57] kenpachie11: 100%

[6:30:12] kenpachie11: @laty1337 can u ask godmode how the FUCK can he play without nameplates, open his stream it's insane
[6:31:02] talys90: he does? hahaha
[6:32:18] grillparty1992: i have to correct myself, while taking a shit i came to this conclusion @kenpachie11 . gdkp's will be fine but LFG gdkp's will probably be rough. sign up gdkp's like i do on earthshaker with log checks etc will be fine for the most part
[6:32:37] kenpachie11: honestly
[6:32:42] kenpachie11: even sign up gdkps will struggle
[6:32:43] kenpachie11: UNLESS
[6:32:48] kenpachie11: they have 15-20 from the same guild
[6:32:56] kenpachie11: that have progressed somewhat on their own
[6:33:20] grillparty1992: well my gdkp has like 20-22 same people and the missing people get filled with good players (logs) and decent budget
[6:33:33] grillparty1992: we clear in like 1h10-15min icc
[6:33:33] kenpachie11: however blizzard are not idiots, I am VERY sure they will either somewhat nerf the content to make it more accessible OR buff the item levels like they did with ulduar u know
[6:33:36] grillparty1992: now
[6:34:16] kenpachie11: people say they quit cata back in the day cos it was shit
[6:34:19] grillparty1992: @kenpachie11 didnt they already say they will release pre-nerf dungeons?
[6:34:20] kenpachie11: bitch it wasn't shit, it was HARD
[6:34:48] kenpachie11: I think the player negative feedback over cata difficulty DURING their beta PTR will make them rethink
[6:34:50] grillparty1992: cata raids especially p1 and p2 were awesome
[6:34:52] kenpachie11: but that's just me being logical
[6:34:52] Yimothee: g'day gang
[6:34:54] grillparty1992: people were just bad
[6:35:10] talys90: @Yimothee good day peepoSex
[6:35:29] kenpachie11: like back then
[6:35:33] kenpachie11: everyone was like a Byorn
[6:35:35] kenpachie11: or an Erfan
[6:35:42] kenpachie11: maybe 1-2% were actual gamers
[6:35:42] Yimothee: @talys90 peepo peepoRasp
[6:35:42] breather_ger: has he already run gnomer?
[6:35:54] grillparty1992: i think sod is a big issue for cata. i think numbers will be bad but blizz knows mop will be good so they will do it anyways.
[6:36:15] grillparty1992: mop has a lot of likers
[6:36:20] talys90: @Yimothee giggidy
[6:36:24] kenpachie11: MoP has pet battles
[6:36:28] kenpachie11: it's literally the savior of WoW
[6:36:45] thepinga: mop was gay
[6:36:46] breather_ger: i know a lot of people liked mop pvp
[6:36:46] kenpachie11: Yeah, dad gamers dig slow pace
[6:36:47] kenpachie11: get it
[6:36:52] talys90: FRESH with Chronoboon and something after Naxxramas BIS
[6:36:53] grillparty1992: mop has a lot of likers laty. you can disagree but mop will have a big audience
[6:37:03] kenpachie11: exactly
[6:37:23] kenpachie11: grillparty has a point to
[6:37:29] kenpachie11: sod might pre-kill cata
[6:37:33] kenpachie11: I hope their lvl 60 stage is ass
[6:37:35] kenpachie11: so people abandon
[6:38:19] grillparty1992: cata wasnt ever gonna be popular anyways because people listen to dumbass dadgamers that hate on cata for no reason or for the reason that their pacing was bad which is a default fix in classic cata
[6:38:27] baefIoyd: i just hope they nerf hunters more and make boomer enha shams wait 2 more phases for 2hand spec B)
[6:38:28] grillparty1992: but mop i think will have a good and wide audience
[6:38:50] kenpachie11: it's up to blizzard to trim the fat
[6:38:54] kenpachie11: they know which features of every expac
[6:38:56] kenpachie11: were good and bad
[6:39:00] kenpachie11: up to them if they polish it or not
[6:39:03] baefIoyd: did u get any gnomer loot laty
[6:39:25] baefIoyd: pepehands
[6:39:29] grillparty1992: sod is their flavour of the month game. they wont do any changes to cata brother
[6:39:58] grillparty1992: i hope they release LFR
[6:40:06] grillparty1992: cause it would give the shitters something to do
[6:40:11] kenpachie11: Nib making sign up raid on Sunday becase he knows u can't play
[6:40:15] kenpachie11: terms for gkick imo
[6:40:25] baefIoyd: isnt first ID extended alot atleast?
[6:40:48] kenpachie11: LFR same level of difficulty as SoD?
[6:40:59] grillparty1992: its probably as hard as sod yes
[6:41:03] grillparty1992: but we need it
[6:41:10] grillparty1992: so the completionists stick around
[6:41:36] baefIoyd: love how the only runes stupid fight club disc havent found are both the slam runes
[6:41:38] baefIoyd: useless apes
[6:41:50] kenpachie11: do not speak about stupid runes
[6:41:54] kenpachie11: until u see the nourish one
[6:41:57] kenpachie11: if you can beat that
[6:42:00] kenpachie11: I will be impressed
[6:42:04] grillparty1992: fightclub were apes anyways
[6:42:06] grillparty1992: fuck em
[6:42:11] kenpachie11: it CANT be worse
[6:42:14] kenpachie11: physically impossible
[6:42:28] bonyato: did riceyx go Bedge ?
[6:42:41] deepweb_ske: No Riceyx? xddleave
[6:42:48] kenpachie11: like bro legit what the fuck was teh guy thinking when making the requirements
[6:42:55] kenpachie11: like was he playing on GM server only or what
[6:43:02] grillparty1992: but yeah speaking of cata... they already re-released a "roadmap" for classic and cata beta has been pushed back on the graphic
[6:43:16] grillparty1992: i swear to god if they push back release ima be turbo mad
[6:43:22] kenpachie11: yeah I saw that
[6:43:26] kenpachie11: they are pushing back 100%
[6:43:32] talys90: @bonyato yeah i think he went to bedge... weichei
[6:43:36] baefIoyd: more time for ICC cranking, who complaining
[6:43:38] bonyato: no one will play cata with sod out
[6:43:43] bonyato: i will tho
[6:43:45] bonyato: xdxd
[6:43:51] grillparty1992: its literally killing the cata audience
[6:43:56] excuteq8: is it fun laty playing SOD?
[6:44:21] bonyato: cata will be fun when sod has its dead moments
[6:44:22] kenpachie11: I feel like 2 months of 30% ICC is enough
[6:44:26] kenpachie11: but they will make it at least 6
[6:44:28] bonyato: but i cant main cata
[6:44:29] kenpachie11: and overkill
[6:44:42] Deadlyblondejr: !gear
[6:44:45] baefIoyd: sod is like 90% dead moments tbf
[6:44:51] talys90: how was the expansion with the Monks called? peepoShy
[6:44:57] grillparty1992: sod is dogshit... cata is what we need. dadgamers will play sod anyways but we need cata for us gamers, asap @bonyato
[6:45:03] StreamElements: Remember you can use your LatyFriendshipPoints (Channel Points)To request Songs. Has to be a Spotify URL -> !sr for info
[6:45:30] talys90: ah yeah MOP, that one i didnt like but anything beyond it pepeD
[6:45:42] grillparty1992: why cant you main cata @bonyato
[6:45:54] grillparty1992: and why is sod a better solution for you
[6:45:58] grillparty1992: just wondering
[6:46:01] bonyato: no
[6:46:13] bonyato: like when sod is dead i will be more inclined to play cata
[6:46:34] bonyato: ive never played cata tho
[6:46:40] bonyato: so hard to tell if i will like it
[6:46:48] grillparty1992: ok but sod will never die, yes for us better players we will get bored because the raids are boring
[6:47:02] bonyato: let me rephrase
[6:47:09] talys90: @bonyato try it out, i bet yu like it pepeD
[6:47:12] bonyato: i will play both
[6:47:13] bonyato: xdd
[6:47:21] baefIoyd: cata is probably fun if its like a 12month expansion
[6:47:28] baefIoyd: problem arrise if it drags
[6:47:36] kenpachie11: there's nothing to drag
[6:47:39] kenpachie11: p1 raids are 3 months
[6:47:41] grillparty1992: most people hating on cata are hating for stupid reasons like content drought back in the day or just hating based on people hating on it or numbers going down back in the day
[6:47:44] kenpachie11: p2 is firelands also 3 months
[6:47:46] bonyato: ill prob raid log cata and sod xdxd
[6:47:48] kenpachie11: and dragon soul 3 months
[6:47:53] kenpachie11: cata won't even be 1 year
[6:48:13] kenpachie11: you know what's stupid
[6:48:16] baefIoyd: ur delusional if u think blizz are gonna run a 9 month expansion
[6:48:18] cloudstrife543: when gnomer
[6:48:18] kenpachie11: do you know the main reason
[6:48:23] kenpachie11: why blizzard EXTEND pahses
[6:48:26] kenpachie11: in wotlk etc
[6:48:30] grillparty1992: cata wiill be raidlog anyways, p1 will be giga hype tho u have 3 raids
[6:48:33] grillparty1992: prebis
[6:48:36] talys90: hahaha
[6:48:50] grillparty1992: transmog
[6:48:51] grillparty1992: etc
[6:49:01] talys90: warrior without wbfs and hitcap PeepoLeaveIntoBooba
[6:49:09] grillparty1992: but i think they wont make cata longer then 12-15 months @kenpachie11
[6:49:15] grillparty1992: they know most people will want mop
[6:49:28] kenpachie11: there's not enough shit to do for that long in cata
[6:49:36] grillparty1992: and i hope they let me move my chars to retail
[6:49:39] kenpachie11: if they do it long they kill it
[6:49:40] grillparty1992: just to have them there
[6:49:45] kenpachie11: the only shit I hate is
[6:49:48] kenpachie11: they always prolong phases
[6:49:51] kenpachie11: and 99% of the time
[6:49:54] kenpachie11: it's due to fucking PVP seasons
[6:49:58] kenpachie11: not being short
[6:50:04] bonyato: cata had long as phases back then right? only 3 phases
[6:50:15] kenpachie11: and only absolute psychos play pvp
[6:50:19] talys90: pvp and arena sucks ass ngl
[6:50:22] kenpachie11: like that priest ximi guy
[6:50:26] kenpachie11: legit psychos
[6:50:32] grillparty1992: @kenpachie11 i think 5months p1, 4 months p2 and 3 months p3 would be perfect.

[6:50:49] grillparty1992: 12 months cata
[6:50:49] bonyato: its fun if u play with friends
[6:51:02] Rockzam: Clueless
[6:51:09] kenpachie11: if u play cata with friends
[6:51:11] kenpachie11: u won't have fun
[6:51:13] kenpachie11: in cata
[6:51:16] kenpachie11: friends become a big ANCHOR
[6:51:20] kenpachie11: if you want to play end content
[6:51:27] bonyato: i dont have friends
[6:51:28] bonyato: xdxd
[6:51:29] Rockzam: dad guilds on suicedwatch
[6:51:58] grillparty1992: p1 and p2 are super fun in cata and p1 will have 3 raids, prebis to farm, transmog to farm etc etc.. 5 months seems good for p1, p2 has a good raid but nothing to do after u grind p1 so 4 months, p3 has the worst raid so logicaly 3 months only
[6:52:04] baefIoyd: ur probably better off playing devistate rune for elites like this
[6:52:05] madden_42: spam thrown
[6:52:14] kenpachie11: yeah that makes sense

[7:13:09] chopptimus1: whats the other debuff you have that isn't the blood stack?

[7:13:10] kenpachie11: LETS GOOOOO
[7:13:13] kenpachie11: THIS IS WHAT CLASSIC IS ABOUT
[7:13:40] Basic_s: The new Bloodless buff you get after rezzing does not prevent you from gaining stacks. It prevents you from giving hostile enemies stacks for 1 minute.
[7:13:41] taffga: Ressing by the spirithealer gives u a 1 minute debuff during which you dont give blood, so killing by spirit guy is useless
[7:13:52] chopptimus1: hotfixed xdd
[7:14:02] Releaserage: you get a debuff when camping btw
[7:14:09] Releaserage: they hotfixed GY camping
