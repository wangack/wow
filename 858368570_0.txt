[2:21:57] Omegacloud: Try to farm some pyrite before you start the fight :)
[2:21:59] Eraste: no, towers not needed

[2:22:04] Kaykerrs: Ulduar suckks lol

[2:22:10] jnewhouse4015: You use the oil slicks to set on fire to damage the boss.
[2:22:21] banishtyrion: isn't leaving the toweers up hard mode ?
[2:22:24] Carax500: i think it slowed the boss too

[2:22:29] esceti95: @Towelliee yh same tbh
[2:22:33] Carax500: yeah towers up is HM
[2:22:35] Eraste: but pyrite is the highest damage, if you get passengers to bring in more barrels
[2:22:48] koorisin: no you leave the towers to activate it
[2:22:48] TheFabilolz: @numenoriangr you dont hard mode with a pug
[2:22:55] Selenar21: click on the boss, it prbly has a bunch of buffs cuz you havent killed the towers
[2:22:59] Tyrolore: IF you don´t take out tower it is HM yea

[2:23:32] Grunton: first boss has no hard mode but towers up make it harder

[4:21:15] Tripl3dot: Gratz on world first
[4:21:31] TrueASDFMan: haste trinket
[4:21:33] Gamer1998: que significa "towelliee, que significa lo siento que piensa que lo dicho es una habla pero es una dormida"
[4:21:33] srze94: blood draning!!
[4:21:35] jure__: is the tier set token useless?
[4:21:49] fuzzbucket: which are the busted trinkets?
[4:21:55] osestosis: Trinkets are 0-light only right?
[4:21:56] rivera9: more loot than castle
[4:22:01] rivera9: NERF
[4:22:03] Gruntman99: how long do these runs normall take

[4:22:22] OlStubbs: Can you do algalon on TW
[4:22:48] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee i did this yesterday on my mage with 15 people- 17 max and it drops the 4-5 pieces still. OP
[4:22:49] anamroth: nope algalon at TW ius not implement
[4:23:11] TheCliffyShow: 2 hours? Must have not been that hard then
[4:23:23] hpsexygames: you want to run it again for me Towellie, good looking
[4:23:40] Kromede: butt loot FeelsAmazingMan
[4:23:44] WoWDank: hows prot pally on SL'S?
[4:23:45] storm99413: average loot for TW raid is 2-3 drop and 4 drop for hardmode
[4:23:45] aikopooh: yea i dont like it
[4:23:57] lithium364: my casual raiding guild is about to break apart because all our tanks and healers rather do pvp then normal raiding pepehands
[4:23:59] Ramalama: only thing wrong with the loot system is pvp is waaaaay more generous than pve
[4:24:03] War_kebab: @Towelliee yeah been a week since i got a upgrade x.x
[4:24:08] Dolyttle: Sucks being starved for loot, makes me not want to play =P
[4:24:09] rivera9: (__) loot
[4:24:19] TrueASDFMan: running the dungeons is fun, but you don't make real progress
[4:24:19] storm99413: @OlStubbs algalon not available on TW
[4:24:28] brokenhelix85: Yea the raids do not give much gear and none of the gear has any effects. Also still upset about no weapons dropping.
[4:24:30] Pallyofhell: yea its sad the ring doesnt work
[4:24:42] Pallyofhell: wish blizzard would fix it so it would
[4:24:52] Dolyttle: wtb Reforging =(
[4:25:11] LinK99191: They need to buff mythic +. Doing both one and pvp at a high level is the only way to get very high ilvl atm
[4:25:15] Masqerader: @Towelliee dont forget to throw that thunderfury on also hoa essences work in there too
[4:25:17] koobaS: you have to use the ring 1 before legendary, with proc effect, it works very well
[4:25:25] brokenhelix85: I just mean in the past random cool weapons more for mog purposes
[4:25:50] Dolyttle: lol 1 piece? -.- you are luckier than I am
[4:25:51] SirRafix: It is very much so depressing
[4:25:52] sazern: killed 22 raid bosses so far and I got 1 piece of loot in total

[4:26:17] lithium364: you think there will be more time between content patches in shadowlands because of this?
[4:26:22] LinK99191: Pvp is the best way to gear reliably by far
[4:26:45] ToastLamoan: @Towelliee also PvP...a ton of almost bis gear for many classes comes from conquest. That irks me a bit coupled with the low raid drops

[4:27:41] Pallyofhell: wasnt this an issue in WoD where people used pvp to gear up before pve players

[4:28:18] brokenhelix85: Next week
[4:28:21] Eggz1004: @Pallyofhell thats what I did with Ashran, geared through premades before raiding
[4:28:21] brokenhelix85: 203 i think
[4:28:35] Decoyszn: 200 what?
[4:28:35] ToastLamoan: yea I'm not doing conquest shit so my guild and raid can suck a D. I will stay llow ilvl till I get something from M+ or great vault
[4:28:45] ThiCCboiyG: i feel like they are keeping it so slow because they dont have any content other than whats there yet so it keeps us coming back
[4:28:50] DankFarik: this is the best pvp season by far, so many pve noobs to kill
[4:28:55] lithium364: that one use pvp trinket which gives primary stat is BiS for many classes in pve LUL
[4:29:01] sinlesssinner: and so are mythic raiding lol
[4:29:02] Pallyofhell: pvpers still thinking pvp is the main concept of the game LUL
[4:29:07] azooooooma: wah wah @Towelliee
[4:29:07] sinlesssinner: its in the minority
[4:29:10] Decoyszn: we talking about renown?
[4:29:11] Thoreya: So is mythic raiders lmao
[4:29:12] fellogiannis: wow pvp has gone downhill since mop
[4:29:13] Decoyszn: upgrade?
[4:29:14] sinlesssinner: so who cares about myffic raiders
[4:29:14] Dolyttle: @Towelliee Swifty has 2 223 swords from PVP already
[4:29:20] fanta_2k: wow pvp is cancer
[4:29:22] Thoreya: Mythic raiding is a minority too
[4:29:24] CADZtv: majority who play mmo's are pve'er not pvp'er
[4:29:32] sinlesssinner: yes, random PVP, yes
[4:29:32] cabalish: pvp is a great way to Start gearing towards new tiers
[4:29:45] LinK99191: Pvp is the only way to gear this tier
[4:29:49] sinlesssinner: have u seen the 40 ppl AVs, conq and ashran lol
[4:29:49] LinK99191: That’s the issue
[4:29:51] Decoyszn: Renown PVP upgrade can go to 200 in the following week, not tuesday.
[4:29:58] sinlesssinner: that alone is like 8 grps of mythic +
[4:30:01] sinlesssinner: each
[4:30:02] inkstainedadventure: I've played this game since Vanilla and have never pvp'd at all
[4:30:14] Rev_4_Life: imagine saying fuck pvers as a pvp thinking you would have a game if all the people who pve quit LOL
[4:30:15] excessior: let us farm raids daily like m+ if they gonna reduce loot
[4:30:16] brokenhelix85: I geared by spamming mythic +10s
[4:30:17] Decoyszn: No it only goes to 200
[4:30:17] anamroth: 200 is cong unraked pure 197 is pure honor gear at max lvl
[4:30:19] Dolyttle: you can already do that though?
[4:30:23] Decoyszn: And its not next week
[4:30:28] TheUnknowing: wrong @sinlesssinner just cause you see people in bgs doesnt mean there are more people that play pvp than pve, your logic is very stupid
[4:30:31] sinlesssinner: dude its 197 for blue gear
[4:30:33] D1Chile: @Towelliee honor gear caps at 200
[4:30:34] sinlesssinner: not 200
[4:30:41] Dolyttle: @Towelliee you can do that already man
[4:30:41] Thoreya: So like like bfa? Lmao
[4:30:46] Thoreya: U didn’t need to raid in bfa
[4:30:50] Decoyszn: Caps at 200, and it isn't even next week - its the week after next
[4:30:52] fluffyyps: and how is that bad for the people who only pvp
[4:31:00] sinlesssinner: @TheUnknowing he s talking about casuals doing what? i said pvp more, just from quantity
[4:31:01] Decoyszn: Bruh.
[4:31:02] Decoyszn: It's not 203
[4:31:04] Decoyszn: It's 207
[4:31:06] SeamanSteven: 1400 for 207
[4:31:06] sinlesssinner: @TheUnknowing so i am right.
[4:31:07] excessior: get reps to exalted and its ilvl 200 gear
[4:31:08] Kheonik: 207*
[4:31:10] Dolyttle: @Towelliee you can get it to 223
[4:31:12] sinlesssinner: 1400 for 207
[4:31:19] alsorrr: what's wrong with that? you choose the content you like to do
[4:31:25] passdat22: 3 items level reeee

[4:31:31] madmannyyz: Pve neeed a valor vendor
[4:31:31] LinK99191: Like trill is almost 230 ilvl and you look at his gear and it’s almost all pvp gear
[4:31:38] TrueASDFMan: now we just need PvE Vendors
[4:31:38] Masqerader: "we want to make loot feel important" implement a shit loot system for pve" then make it easy for pvp to get 200 gear for the minimal requirement
[4:31:40] Decoyszn: PVPERS ARE GETTING IT WAY LATER THAN PVE
[4:31:45] DankFarik: 1400 combatant, 1600 challenger, 1800 rival
[4:31:45] LinK99191: I agree that pvpers should have vendors
[4:31:45] TheUnknowing: @sinlesssinner You aren't though, just cause epic bgs require more people doesnt mean there are more people in general innately doing it
[4:31:47] Decoyszn: Yall have had the raid out already
[4:31:47] Harskare: good thing blizzard is trying to get the player base to play the whole game, might be intentional to push more of the player base into pvp
[4:31:57] Thoreya: How do we know it’s not good for the game lmao it’s been out for a month
[4:32:01] excessior: i get they reduced m+ loot but reducing raid loot doesnt make sense
[4:32:03] candiman0420: Need valor back 😉
[4:32:07] Decoyszn: That is the BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. PVP gear has been timegated
[4:32:08] Sandisy: timing 5-6 keys an evening without getting any loot to show for it if unlucky is just a bad reward system
[4:32:17] klacksnap: What do you want to see happen?
[4:32:24] Dolyttle: Agreed @Sandisy
[4:32:34] H0lydiver: well you know, vendors is hard to find =)
[4:32:36] sinlesssinner: @TheUnknowing dude its just math, 1min Qs for epic BGs lol not sure why u are arguing with me. pvp is more inviting for fresh levels too.
[4:32:36] nyro____: A badge vendor would fix most of the gearing problem
[4:32:41] Thoreya: We gonna go back to BFA loot and people gonna complain there’s too much loot again
[4:32:41] Hangalik: the question is, should a PvEer get better opportunities for gear if he does PvP too
[4:32:43] Decoyszn: We finally get to unlock 200 honor gear while yall have had normal, heroic, and mythic raids out.
[4:32:45] LinK99191: Like asmongold said they really should drop tokens from m+ and raid so when you don’t get any loot you feel like you wasted all of your time
[4:32:52] klacksnap: bring back badges!!!!!
[4:32:53] Rev_4_Life: valor vendors
[4:32:55] sinlesssinner: @TheUnknowing again, i am not talking about rated, i am talking about just Qing for normal BGs
[4:32:58] dusk90: until now pvpers had to do pve to get gear..now pveers have to do pvp to get gear..hmmm ggs
[4:32:59] comicbookrican: WATCH THEY MAKE THE PVP GEAR, ONLY WORK IN PVP LOL
[4:33:00] Harskare: @towelliee solution is to put a pvp stat back in the game like resil so pvers arnt intresested in that gear
[4:33:00] Scubaskot: @Towelliee why are u doing TW dungeons?
[4:33:05] espasona1: like they did in WOTLK?
[4:33:05] Ballswagger: like badges of valor in wotlk
[4:33:10] TrueASDFMan: almost like it was way back when
[4:33:11] KonradGM: sooo valor LUL
[4:33:13] Dolyttle: its the weekly @Scubaskot
[4:33:13] calendorf: M+ is awful, last night we pushed all dungeons to 12, took us all night, and i got nothing with a few 35 anima
[4:33:19] Pallyofhell: @ItsDecoySZN the problem with that is after all these weeks ppl still have base mythic dungeon gear cause of this system
[4:33:20] remedyt: bring back valor points PogChamp
[4:33:22] killtehnoob: Yes, bring back badges, what they did in BC and WOTLK
[4:33:36] Scubaskot: @Dolyttle yes, but doesnt he have 215 ilvl?
[4:33:39] Morelin10: Like bc
[4:33:45] sinlesssinner: they are doing pvp in addition to pve man, just to fix their loot and any slot they were unlucky with, otherwise its all mythic+ and raiding for pvers
[4:33:46] Decoyszn: @Pallyofhell what system? plenty of people are way more geared than just PVPers atm
[4:33:49] TrueASDFMan: I don't mind PvP giving good gear. But if it's *this* much better to gear, everything else is just frustrating
[4:33:49] lithium364: its even more crazy if vers is your best dmg stat in pve too
[4:33:49] blightanker: @Towelliee will take this system many times over titanforge/warforged that we use to have in order to avoid it---just didnt feel right rewarding extremely high item to just random ppl
[4:33:58] sinlesssinner: and i like that system, if u want more options, do more stuff.
[4:34:02] Pallyofhell: @ItsDecoySZN cause they pvped themselves
[4:34:04] Decoyszn: @TrueASDFMan It's not *this* much.
[4:34:05] fluffyyps: to upgrade your pve gear there had to be a ranking system in place. like clearing 15 keys
[4:34:06] Dolyttle: eh still the weekly? and maybe he wants the badges not sure lol i do it regardless =D
[4:34:10] MrGattz: Yeah iv already given the solution for pve weeks ago. Every m+ boss drops a token. The higher the key the more tokens. You can then use the tokens to buy the gear you want from a vender
[4:34:11] fluffyyps: to match 2100 pvp gear
[4:34:20] shuey23: yeah Ive been doing M+ casually maybe like 20-25 total and the few items i got were not upgrades Sadge
[4:34:21] fluffyyps: and people would cry about that aswell
[4:34:50] Ribbwich: People gonna cry.
[4:34:52] sinlesssinner: you spam 15s tho :p and get drops everytime
[4:34:56] burton303: would it be better if u could only use pvp gear in pvp and have to get pve gear for pve
[4:34:57] KyrikTV: Y'all could upgrade your Covenant gear....
[4:34:58] Decoyszn: @Pallyofhell That makes no sense. We've had crazy RNG vault 207+ if you get 1400, or conquest capped at 550 a week while most pieces cost 700-800, weapons more. Yall got mythic +'s and normal raids for the last few week clears.
[4:34:59] D1Chile: @Towelliee meh u could chees that achieve with 2 rogue and fan of knife interup
[4:35:03] Decoyszn: @Pallyofhell There literally is NO argument.
[4:35:04] sinlesssinner: u cant spam past 2200 u wait for next week for ONE loot :p
[4:35:09] LinK99191: Mythic + is only for vault 210 cap is way too low
[4:35:11] Ribbwich: what @KyrikTV said
[4:35:17] LinK99191: For it to be worth doing
[4:35:32] TheCliffyShow: Was Gundrak always such a short dungeon? I did it earlier today and only took like 10 minutes, maybe a little more.
[4:35:50] CDubTheRIPper: dcwThink
[4:35:50] akia03: @TheCliffyShow lots of skips
[4:35:53] MrGattz: You can’t upgrade your covenant gear to anything useful atm.
[4:35:56] Masqerader: i fought 2 sub rogues this morning in arena, had to be the 2x worst sub rogues ever cause I trashed them
[4:35:57] Pallyofhell: @ItsDecoySZN getting full 184 within hours compared to some having to spend weeks to even do that is the argument
[4:36:00] warrenny: !uptime
[4:36:01] Moobot: Towelliee has been live for 4h 36m
[4:36:03] MrGattz: Not for another 8 weeks.
[4:36:07] fluffyyps: the problem is you are allowed to fil it. the keys should be timed for your rating to increase
[4:36:19] dizzlethebot: I like RBGs
[4:36:24] Ribbwich: Maybe people should slow down on content
[4:36:27] KingSlayerYotam: now the premiere pve content is bgs
[4:36:35] Ardailec: I'd like to see a 3rd item drop in M+ for a three chest. I think that'd be good enough
[4:36:38] LinK99191: I think 15s should drop like 218-220 that would somewhat fix it
[4:36:39] Masqerader: heroic raiding has never meant anything since MOP change and mythic was added
[4:36:43] Decoyszn: @Pallyofhell That I can agree with, if u get lucky with BG wins. But that "advantage" stopped dead in its tracks there.
[4:36:51] LinK99191: Nah it wouldn’t 210 is too low @ardailec
[4:36:51] brokenhelix85: Then make the "premier pve content" drop enough loot to help a raid progress
[4:36:54] Pallyofhell: getting bg wins isnt an issue
[4:36:57] MrGattz: @ribbwich that’s not a solution
[4:37:09] Decoyszn: @Pallyofhell It can be if you're just not getting lucky
[4:37:20] Sandisy: must be a reason behind trying to funnel everyone into the raid. like, budget will get cut if a certain % sees it. why else not let people just play the game
[4:37:28] excessior: doing above m15+ should give 220 at least they could timegate it
[4:37:34] ambiotic: ive done more arenas this week than M+s and I am PVEr, thats not good
[4:37:39] Ballswagger: i havent stepped foot in nathria yet and im ilvl 200
[4:37:53] Pallyofhell: ive gotten more pvp gear than pve gear
[4:38:19] Decoyszn: No offense, but you also play a broken spec in arena.
[4:38:22] Masqerader: Conclusion its a joke
[4:38:23] Ribbwich: @MrGattz but its the one they are banking on, it's the first two months of an expac, eventually gear will start falling from the sky, this discussion will be moot by March
[4:38:24] Decoyszn: Not everyone gets 1800
[4:38:34] Pallyofhell: everyone gets 1800 in RBG
[4:38:43] Ordicos: one of the pieces might been the weekly quest 2 weeks aago
[4:38:44] Pallyofhell: rating in RBG is so inflatted
[4:38:45] dizzlethebot: 1800 is hard to get if your casual lol
[4:38:49] excessior: yeah i got one heroic piece from 18 bosses
[4:38:50] fanta_2k: 1800 is easier than clearing nhc in pug
[4:38:50] kennn_y: I mainly jsut do pve but my 198mage currently got more pvp gear than pve its really fun
[4:38:53] Decoyszn: @Pallyofhell that is very true
[4:38:55] Ballswagger: isnt 1600 207?
[4:38:55] KonradGM: who do i pay gold to get to 1800? LUL
[4:39:04] ManneehFresh: Most people can’t get 1800 so it sucks. It’s easier for you
[4:39:05] MagsVicious: at least 2
[4:39:08] ShinoaKurisu: 120 a day
[4:39:12] Decoyszn: @fanta_2k no way
[4:39:12] Flyax: 120 a day
[4:39:13] ShinoaKurisu: if you win all 3
[4:39:16] madmannyyz: you get cap easy in SL
[4:39:24] ManneehFresh: That’s what I’m doing. I’m grinding it slow. Because I suck at pvp
[4:39:32] ManneehFresh: I’m great at pve
[4:39:36] ImProGrG: If you dont have partners for rated games you cant gear that good in pvp :(
[4:39:44] sweexie: 120
[4:39:49] iDuggles: Pvp gearing feels really good, got my 220 2h already, my guild is nowhere near heroic denathrius so it was super worth
[4:39:49] Staksor: @zer0thehero117 at this point main stat should still give you more dps. my advice tho, always use sims
[4:39:53] sweexie: 40 + 65 + 15
[4:39:54] Ascendor81: Rename EXP PACK TO "PVPLANDS"

[4:40:12] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:40:18] ManneehFresh: I’m grind for the 900 conquest weapon. I say at a time
[4:40:28] Decoyszn: @fanta_2k if you're gonna mention pugging CN (which isnt hard) then that would be the equivalent of pugging arenas, and it is very hard to get 1800 pugging
[4:40:29] K_Rok: Music Kreygasm
[4:40:31] MrGattz: @Ribbwich yeah but they are gating gear atm. i cant see any time soon where gear will just be falling from the sky. iv run like 8 m+ dungeons and i get 2 pieces of gear, 1 one which i didnt even need. thats like what? 4 hours of my life for no progression. just not a great system atm is the problem.
[4:41:04] Molvonos: I'm definitely more excited about the 226 coming out of the vault than M+'s
[4:41:25] Masqerader: u know u can put ur heart of azeroth on and use essences and thunderfury is ilvl 33 which is the same around wrath now. if u wanna add a little fun to timewalks
[4:41:26] cheersfordoobies: sup towellie
[4:41:42] Decoyszn: @MrGattz How is that different than pvp?
[4:42:14] fanta_2k: @ItsDecoySZN pugging in rbg aint that hard
[4:42:14] klacksnap: and i LOVE that!! :)
[4:42:20] Pallyofhell: cause gearing through pvp is literally easier than high keys right now
[4:42:24] Ribbwich: @MrGattz Its literally a tale as old as this game, you aren't always going to walk away from time spent with gear. That was true in 2006 it's true today
[4:42:29] LinK99191: There are CE guilds who are like 4-5/10 lol
[4:42:43] brokenhelix85: In my opinion the mythic content to reach the same Ilvl as pvp is more difficult and more time consuming
[4:42:43] Decoyszn: @fanta_2k pugging rbg to 1800 is decently hard dude
[4:42:44] K_Rok: PVP is also really fun right now so it could be worse :)
[4:43:01] Decoyszn: time consuming? lol what.

[4:43:02] MrGattz: in pvp you gear honor and conquest. no matter what you do in pvp you are progression becuase you can buy your gear and upgrade all of it past 200ilvl by just grinding.
[4:43:20] MrGattz: @Ribbwich thats not the point here lol
[4:43:21] Pallyofhell: i soloed 2 ww monks in 2's as ret LUL
[4:43:32] MrGattz: progressing*
[4:43:35] Bubba_T_Baggin: i hate pvp xD makes me Sadge
[4:43:43] Decoyszn: @MrGattz the possibility isn't what I meant. you complained about it taking 4 hours of your, its not like pvp is much faster
[4:44:00] MrGattz: @ItsDecoySZN right the 4 hours wasnt the point either
[4:44:10] K_Rok: I've been grinding with non-meta comps and having fun trying to figure out how to counter the OP guys

[4:44:25] KonradGM: anybody know eu pvp carry communites where you can p[ay with gold?
[4:44:38] Moobot: Calm the spam, @WoWDank (warning)
[4:44:47] Ribbwich: @MrGattz it seems like it is lol if you are worried about gearing and wanna go fast, do BG's. Personally they aren't ever worth the time.
[4:44:47] brokenhelix85: Pallies are great this week for necrotic
[4:44:49] MrGattz: the point was that there is a very very clear upgrade path for pvp and there is no path for pve. pve is pure rng based, pvp is a cut and dry path to end game
[4:44:54] brokenhelix85: Prob best tanks right now
[4:44:57] Ballswagger: whats the strongest tank right now?
[4:45:00] Harskare: @towelliee any idea how prot warr is doing in m+?

[4:45:58] K_Rok: nerf convonke!
[4:46:01] warrenny: How dare they have vacation Kappa
[4:46:04] Ballswagger: please dont nerf my feral
[4:46:08] flodwtf: I got 1802 rating in 2 vs 2, just capping qonquest in 3 vs 3 to always have that 1800 rating for gear.. :P
[4:46:08] Zerohz1: dnt say stuff like that LUL
[4:46:08] Revelations45: 'Unholy does need a buff
[4:46:14] Ribbwich: i mean how do they even nerf convoke?
[4:46:16] Revelations45: they are in a bad spot
[4:46:23] LinK99191: Boomkins convoke can legit 1 shot multiple people
[4:46:25] aikopooh: buff locks buff locks Kappa
[4:46:29] Kheonik: nerf prot and ret healing, actually nerf all hybrid healing, nerf convoke, nerf rogue burst more, nerf monks... what else+
[4:46:31] klacksnap: idk, 4 spells instead of 700 for convoke would be a good fix lol
[4:46:31] Decoyszn: @Ribbwich make it so it doesnt cast spells you don’t even freaking have
[4:46:33] LinK99191: If you bop them so it doesn’t get kicked
[4:46:38] Pallyofhell: unholy is not in a bad spot
[4:46:47] tocu: how much you think will be hammered on adventures since that is a mechanic that seem to have put off casual players
[4:46:47] Pallyofhell: unholy is higher up than most melee classes
[4:46:50] Ribbwich: @ItsDecoySZN thats the whole point of convoke
[4:46:52] Jacorvin: Convoke is a fun ability, I love it. But its should not have been added to the game
[4:46:57] cheersfordoobies: i cant wait for that convoke change lmao
[4:47:01] Noshpan: Unholy is nowhere near being in a bad spot lol
[4:47:05] excessior: Ion is raiding
[4:47:07] Mockle: as they should°
[4:47:09] TheCliffyShow: You mean game developers have lives to? No way!
[4:47:13] Masqerader: convoke the spirits is gonna get the ronas
[4:47:14] vanzx: Well unholy isnt bad everything else is just better lol
[4:47:17] TrueASDFMan: can't blame them
[4:47:23] LinK99191: Unholy is top 3 classes in the game
[4:47:25] LinK99191: Easily
[4:47:26] Decoyszn: @Ribbwich It's a crap point. lol
[4:47:29] LinK99191: Ur trippin
[4:47:37] NoSingularity: Kappa
[4:47:39] Revelations45: Unholy only needs like 10% buff and then they will be in a good spot @LinK99191
[4:47:43] Zerohz1: monk
[4:47:45] KonradGM: balance
[4:47:46] swampt1l: buff BM

[4:48:30] Revelations45: No unholy needs a buff not a nerf
[4:48:30] Ribbwich: @ItsDecoySZN is it or are you just mad because you got one shot by a druid?
[4:48:43] Decoyszn: @Ribbwich nope I know how to live
[4:48:47] Revelations45: Teggu thinks the same thing Buff unholy and life is much better for unholy

[4:49:13] Masqerader: u can skip to last boss
[4:49:15] MasqureMan: Why would unholy get a buff, it’s doing great
[4:49:16] excessior: yeah you can skip bosses in tw
[4:49:19] Kromede: ignore the trools chat
[4:49:19] Dreadfrost: @Towelliee frost dk needs some love
[4:49:29] Masqerader: nope
[4:49:29] Revelations45: @Towelliee we need to get Stepbrother to buff Unholy
[4:49:32] Pallyofhell: frost dks need a buff
[4:49:34] brokenhelix85: Havok DH should get some more love I think
[4:49:34] Decoyszn: frost dk is great in pvp
[4:49:42] espasona1: maybe an intro zone skip if youve already done it
[4:49:42] Umoran: @Towelliee no love for dps warriors u think ?
[4:49:43] Harskare: @TOWELLIEE you understand top druids in pvp dont play convoke? kyrian is much better and consistent
[4:49:43] Pallyofhell: in pvp frost is good but pve
[4:49:46] ThiCCboiyG: frost dk is better for pvp rn for burst
[4:49:47] BadXo: Frost mages will get a buff
[4:49:49] madmannyyz: yeah but in pve its prty bad
[4:49:49] MN_Generic: I find funny people crying about convoke when you can latterly hard counter it by stunning or interrupt
[4:49:50] ninjitsu124: havoc dh needs more buffs
[4:49:50] Revelations45: Frost is better then unholy right now in raids
[4:49:52] Decoyszn: who plays frost mage? lol
[4:49:53] vanzx: warrior dps is bis lmao.
[4:49:55] K_Rok: everyone says frost is better than unholy right now in arena
[4:49:59] ambiotic: Arms warrior nerf in areana
[4:50:00] Decoyszn: that hasnt been a spec ever
[4:50:03] TrueASDFMan: SPriest needs a buff Kappa
[4:50:18] brokenhelix85: Afflic Perma slow will get nerfed
[4:50:20] ambiotic: Divine Toll nerf in arena
[4:50:26] espasona1: make raids drop a bit more loot
[4:50:32] vanzx: Divine toll was already nerfed in pvp lol
[4:50:37] Pallyofhell: divine toll is hard to nerf at this point
[4:50:39] Ribbwich: people be hella short sighted just based on them feelings getting hurt in pvp
[4:50:44] swampt1l: so Season 2 SL?
[4:50:46] Pallyofhell: w/o making the whole ability useless
[4:50:46] StrawhatOwen: dont take away from Pvp but add to pve
[4:50:57] StrawhatOwen: or give PVE vendors aswell
[4:51:00] Decoyszn: NO WAY
[4:51:04] Decoyszn: Conquest has such a low cap
[4:51:07] Revelations45: Ilvl bump maybe to PVE and buff unholy
[4:51:07] excessior: gives reroll coins back
[4:51:16] klacksnap: they better remove that cap then lol
[4:51:23] Decoyszn: Then you have to remove conquest cap
[4:51:36] Mattsta: ^
[4:51:38] JLmorten: They can put in more Weekley gear, Like more Timewalks.
[4:51:40] Decoyszn: I'm fine with it costing conquest, if you remove the cap.
[4:51:42] MrGattz: no, you just make the upgrade cost a lot less with conquest
[4:51:47] Jacorvin: The only option is to ditch pvp vendors, I dont even know where they are anyway
[4:51:51] vanzx: or just buff m+ loot
[4:51:52] Recruitie: I want other systems like the pvp, nnot a pvp nerf imo
[4:51:54] Phatlooter: do you get conquest if you lose
[4:52:11] excessior: increase honor cost
[4:52:12] MrGattz: and keep it capped so you cant just grind your entire 200+ set in one week
[4:52:18] Creampuff1112: plz go back to resilliance gear and make pvegear not function in pvp
[4:52:19] swampt1l: no @Phatlooter
[4:52:23] ninjitsu124: if pvpers are not gonnna have to raid for gear why would they care about itl?
[4:52:25] iDuggles: I doubt they are going to make that big of a change to gearing right now. Maybe next raid tier
[4:52:37] Decoyszn: @Jacorvin that is the worst take ever.
[4:52:38] K_Rok: lol
[4:52:48] Hangalik: the question is, should a PvEer get better opportunities for gear if he does PvP too
[4:52:58] Jacorvin: @ItsDecoySZN It was also not serious
[4:53:02] MrGattz: @Hangalik no
[4:53:05] Revelations45: It would be easy to gear if they would just buff unholy
[4:53:08] Scoodles91: they can learn :D
[4:53:09] Decoyszn: I have to do the same as pvper, @Hangalik @MrGattz
[4:53:22] Decoyszn: Literall my BIS legendary comes from SLG in CN.
[4:53:24] CADZtv: i mean its an mmo they main draw for it is pve not pvp
[4:53:33] Mabusa: honor grind = AP grind, good for engagement
[4:53:33] MrGattz: yeah if you dont like pvp you shouldnt be forced to do it to progress to end game
[4:53:38] Scoodles91: they learn new mechanics every tier dont they? Whats the diffrence
[4:53:42] klacksnap: tru. i just dont want pvpers to be back ina place where they are irrelevant and HAVE to do PvE to be decent in pvp.
[4:53:45] Pallyofhell: its never been pvp focused
[4:53:50] Jacorvin: Pvps were complaining about having to pve to get gear, the same goes for pvers. we dont want to pvp for loot
[4:53:51] Revelations45: BC was not a bad time for PVP
[4:54:02] Apheelia: yeah I dont wanna pvp
[4:54:02] Revelations45: Brutal sets
[4:54:03] swampt1l: u can get those when they introduce lfr SLG KEKW @ItsDecoySZN
[4:54:19] Decoyszn: @SwapT1_ February? Seriously?....lmao
[4:54:29] srze94: @Towelliee REsielience needs to be brought back!
[4:54:38] klacksnap: resil ftw!
[4:54:44] JLmorten: Some trash in a Normal D when I was leveling my warrior droppet a 190ilv bow. fucking stupid shit
[4:54:47] TrueASDFMan: was about to say that. I'd be pissed as a PvP if I had to do PvE to stay competetive
[4:54:48] excessior: should m+ players have to do raids then ?
[4:54:51] swampt1l: well idk if you raid but i was just saying @ItsDecoySZN
[4:54:53] haggis_chaser: haggis_chaser subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[4:54:54] Dvmaaren: in a game focused for 85% on pve, and 15% on pvp, i dont feel its wrong to expect the 15% to put some time into the 85%
[4:55:17] K_Rok: Is it normal for PVP to be a little unbalanced?
[4:55:21] Decoyszn: @SwapT1_ I'd rather not, I did to already get my legendary. But if people are gonna complain a PVE'r has to do pvp right now to get better opportunities, its the same vice versa.
[4:55:35] MrGattz: @excessior well raiding is no different than m+, just more people.
[4:55:36] Decoyszn: @Dvmaaren It is not 85/15
[4:55:48] swampt1l: you just jinxed urself
[4:55:50] MrGattz: and no timer
[4:55:51] Mattsta: my first dungeon was pit...why is that even on the timewalking list x.x
[4:55:56] StrawhatOwen: it always did
[4:55:57] Dreadfrost: @Towelliee ulduar drops 200ilvl
[4:56:03] Dvmaaren: @ItsDecoySZN sorry 95/5
[4:56:04] StrawhatOwen: they ruined it in SL
[4:56:13] Decoyszn: @Dvmaaren you're vastly underestimating the pvp base
[4:56:16] TrueASDFMan: @Dvmaaren in a small game with a small team, yeah. But Blizz is big enough that they should be able to handle both
[4:56:16] swampt1l: he did a full clear of it @Dreadfrost
[4:56:23] Dreadfrost: ah
[4:56:28] StrawhatOwen: It was good gear but in SL the screwed it over
[4:56:32] LinK99191: It’s definitely 85/15
[4:56:37] LinK99191: Maybe even 90/10
[4:56:42] Decoyszn: You can have that opinion :)
[4:56:56] Decoyszn: Based on what? @LinK99191
[4:57:05] Revelations45: First question sloot should ask is will you please Buff unholy @Towelliee
[4:57:11] deadwarlockx: if you leave tw uldir midway, then make your own grp, and reQ do you have to fight all the bosses again or does it go off raid leaders id?
[4:57:40] Decoyszn: Exactly.
[4:58:12] Revelations45: I am crying right now

[4:58:13] Masqerader: ya but if pver's don't get a loot buff change, or they say next patch etc, a lot of people won't stick around till while waiting
[4:58:17] tauntpleas: I'ma say 30/70 just bc casuals get gear easier pvpon
[4:58:17] CADZtv: mmo are always pve then pvp
[4:58:18] MrGattz: @deadwarlockx id assume its the same as any raid. you kill a boss, you get locked from killing it again
[4:58:30] MarquisLek: bring back badge vendors
[4:58:35] MarquisLek: shadow valor or some shit
[4:58:41] MrGattz: you tag a boss and it dies rather then you get locked from killing it again
[4:58:53] LinK99191: Tons of people will quit if they don’t fix it next tier
[4:58:58] Decoyszn: what does mythic + give up to iLVL?
[4:59:01] nocturnal_2195: I like both pve and pvp so it's great for me that I can hear in pvp
[4:59:03] SullaRS: !ui

[4:59:07] ThiCCboiyG: what happened in draenor? i was deployed when draenor came out
[4:59:09] LinK99191: Many people will even quit before then
[4:59:32] swampt1l: there was no content LUL @papa_del_mar
[4:59:34] TrueASDFMan: esp since a lot of casual players simply don't have that time
[4:59:36] ManneehFresh: What was so wrong with draenor? Didn’t play the expansion
[4:59:40] lithium364: indeed it will be cataclysm all over again with casual raiding guilds breaking apart
[4:59:40] akia03: tons have already stopped playing
[4:59:42] Mockle: its not like those people dont want to invest that time, most people just cant
[4:59:43] excessior: peopel gonna quit once they got all the loot anyway
[4:59:48] DM_Hakai: This is no sense, dunno why we had to do pve for playing pvp back in bfa
[4:59:51] Ardailec: Dreanor had nothing to do for Casuals. That was it's problem
[4:59:52] DM_Hakai: its the same argument
[4:59:52] MrGattz: 10 hours of m+ dungeon runs for 2 pieces of random gear
[5:00:00] Ribbwich: badge vendor isn't what the game needs.
[5:00:03] Klarynse: lol if that
[5:00:10] Oakless11: as someone who cant play that much, its been difficult to get loot and is frustrating at times.
[5:00:11] Mockle: couple? like 1 hour
[5:00:12] Ribbwich: that would set a pretty shit precedent for the rest of the expac
[5:00:14] Ardailec: Casuals could just play with the Garrison table...and that was basically it. It was Raid or Die.
[5:00:17] ImProGrG: @towelliee do you think they will up the droprate again in M+ and raids?
[5:00:23] Bubba_T_Baggin: its like doing 5 Timewalk dungeons to get an item that is lower ilvl that current item xD also being the same named item lol
[5:00:24] Masqerader: I think i hit the jackpot today, i got 3 pieces of loot from mythic + on a new 60 rogue lol
[5:00:29] Fioray: I'm probably the only person who doesn't care about loot. I just like leveling and occational "endgame" dungeon. To me it's more of a social thing with my guild.
[5:00:30] loken1: Why don’t they just add a badge/currency vendor for M+?
[5:00:31] excessior: most of my guild stop logging on once they clear the raid
[5:00:38] Ribbwich: @loken1 its a bad idea
[5:00:45] tocu: it doesnt help they added a week between wings of lfr is crazy to me
[5:00:46] MrGattz: nothing
[5:00:46] CDubTheRIPper: we're getting more BOEs than boss loot LUL
[5:00:53] Peterbant: I’m in vet school so i don’t have time for hours of grinding for little to no gear. It
[5:00:54] akia03: 200 gear
[5:00:54] Snufflupagus_: Would you make love to a midget for a free meal at a nice steakhouse? and what sides would you like with that?
[5:00:56] Scoodles91: 200 ilvl item
[5:00:56] MrGattz: atm, absolutely nothing

[5:01:12] pukerud: now you get "done" you did not in BFA with titanforging.
[5:01:18] Waspire: i cant raid at all.. my guild died long time ago.
[5:01:20] ManneehFresh: I hate pvp so much. I have to grind for the stupid weapons
[5:01:26] TrueASDFMan: more anima
[5:01:28] calendorf: @towelliee im in a guild for dads and mums, we raid one day a week as we all have newborn kids, most of the guild is already voting to quit wow as we cannot progress enough with almost no loot, and not M+ doesnt help we are stuck for progression
[5:01:29] Skizzurp: next week we get upgraded rewards from WQs
[5:01:30] Ribbwich: @Nomeroh no you don't.
[5:01:31] akia03: vendor
[5:01:34] Mattsta: exalted also has a mount
[5:01:41] kalamari__: at the quartermasters
[5:01:45] railroad10989: that mastery trinket in bastion pretty op
[5:01:46] Bubba_T_Baggin: WQ are absolute dogshit FeelsBadMan
[5:01:49] MrGattz: it was an amazing system, its not the answer though
[5:01:56] swampt1l: Callings are also super trash @Towelliee
[5:01:58] ManneehFresh: I don’t have friend so I can’t spam dungeons with pugs
[5:02:00] excessior: whats the point of titanforge if you dont get gear anyway
[5:02:04] ambiotic: badge vendor
[5:02:07] Decoyszn: @Skizzurp next week its arena skirmishes
[5:02:07] ambiotic: easy peasy
[5:02:07] Rainadin: @towelliee Vendor is in Darkhaven
[5:02:08] TrueASDFMan: hell no, I can't imagine a scenario where I'd want TF back
[5:02:14] Ribbwich: @SwapT1_ i get gear in my callings p often
[5:02:15] TheCliffyShow: Complain when it's there. Complain when it's gone.
[5:02:15] Ardailec: FeelsBadMan We don't need Titanforging. Just a badge vendor, or one extra drop.
[5:02:16] Decoyszn: @Skizzurp the next week is when its WQ
[5:02:16] kalamari__: @Towelliee the quartermasters at oribos
[5:02:18] xandoxx: Used to do lots of WQ as a casual for gear but this is just dire at the moment for gear
[5:02:23] killtehnoob: Bring back badges like bc and wotlk, bring back upgrades for gear with the same like panderia
[5:02:24] zorkxzx: !subs
[5:02:25] brokenhelix85: No titan. perhaps warforging through a upgrade system or something.
[5:02:29] klacksnap: "here is your gray item"
[5:02:29] MethmM: callings are emissary quests basically, same shit
[5:02:29] swampt1l: LUL I've never gotten one so yikes bruh @Ribbwich
[5:02:32] Pallyofhell: fuck callings LUL
[5:02:33] TrueASDFMan: callings are nice for fresh casual players
[5:02:35] Vibical: a power i already have
[5:02:36] Rainadin: Ziathion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Love ya man!
[5:02:36] facerolljack: Valor needs to come back and it will be fine, you'll atleast get something for your time spent
[5:02:37] akia03: atleast they give 184 condiuts
[5:02:39] zorkxzx: !subcount
[5:02:42] Luvme66: what do you think calling should give?
[5:02:43] Bahamut145: Close to bolvar
[5:02:44] excessior: warforging is fine, titanforging wasnt
[5:02:44] Apheelia: I love the game play! But rewards are LAME
[5:02:46] LinK99191: Callings LUL
[5:02:46] Ardailec: Callings do also give a large chunk of rep
[5:02:47] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob that's not a healthy solution
[5:02:49] swampt1l: its rare af @diathi123
[5:02:50] TrueASDFMan: at least the epic one
[5:02:52] MrGattz: callings are just for gold. if you need gold for some reason you do your callings
[5:02:56] Bubba_T_Baggin: the 4 corners near Bolvar
[5:02:58] Ballswagger: at exalted you buy your tabard and you enjoy it
[5:03:01] Truepach: the enclave down the bottom of the map
[5:03:09] killtehnoob: @Ribbwich in what way
[5:03:09] akia03: @SwapT1_ really almost always get 1
[5:03:13] excessior: just give me flying so i can be bothered doing WQ
[5:03:20] Pleau: there's no quartermaster there
[5:03:26] Pleau: I am literally sitting there
[5:03:27] Apheelia: MORE ANIMA
[5:03:31] swampt1l: i do them on my mage alot and get nothing lol..... @diathi123
[5:03:33] excessior: if you want gold you go do boe runs
[5:03:50] Pleau: oh nevermind, it's a bit further out
[5:03:54] SeamanSteven: fix anima grind
[5:03:56] Peachvizzle: i miss stuff like frozen orb or gems drops from dungeons - could be a way to fix the loot problem when atleast you get something from a run
[5:04:04] swampt1l: Yeah i could not find rep quartermaster on my pally
[5:04:05] MrGattz: tbh i have no idea where you get 200ilvl loot from being exalted. iv never seen a vender for it
[5:04:06] hpsexygames: what is the max level renown currently?
[5:04:11] Rainadin: @towelliee it's in Darkhaven in Revendreth
[5:04:13] War_kebab: 46. 75 in oribos
[5:04:16] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob so lets say you add a vendor this week, gives loot for some sort of Mythic currency. How do you scale that? Do higher keys give you more access to higher ilvl? Or does it give more currency? What happens in season 2? 3?
[5:04:17] MrGattz: 18 @hpsexygames
[5:04:31] Decoyszn: next week is 21, the week after is 22 for pvp gear to upgrade
[5:04:31] excessior: @MrGattz each quartermaster give some rep loot
[5:04:33] Miffrah: there is quartermasters and its 1 200ilvl item per covenant
[5:04:41] BaldNed: Quartermasterr are one room to the left of Bolvar, opposite direction of PvP vendors
[5:04:49] tocu: yes they are seperate
[5:04:51] Decoyszn: We have to wait even 1 more week ;)
[5:04:52] MrGattz: its just 1 piece of 200 ilvl loot? thats it?
[5:04:54] tocu: they all should have a mount
[5:04:55] TurqMaggot: yes
[5:04:55] Ardailec: I think you can buy a mount? If you mean the Ascended
[5:04:55] fallowing_deer: yes
[5:04:56] kalamari__: just go to oribos, they are 4 there on the same spot
[5:04:59] ArctosPrime: tabard, some pets ect
[5:05:03] Mattsta: most of teh stuff on the quartermasters don't require the related covenant
[5:05:07] ShinoaKurisu: mount wep illusion tabard and 200 piece for all rep pretty much
[5:05:08] facerolljack: @Ribbwich very simple, just make it like PvP, if you do high keys you get higher ilvl but the same amount of currency as someone who is doing +5s
[5:05:11] Epiclurker27893: Everyone has access to the rep vendors
[5:05:14] Recruitie: @Towelliee there's mount/tabard/weapon apearance/toys etc.
[5:05:16] Rainadin: also a wep enchanti
[5:05:23] killtehnoob: @Ribbwich gear is always scaled each patch, i'm not sure what exactly you're asking or why that's not feasible
[5:05:25] Ribbwich: @facerolljack then whats the point of high keys?
[5:05:35] fallowing_deer: There are legendary memories to buy from each covenant
[5:06:04] Thoreya: does anyone know what the world quest ilvl is gonna be once we upgrade our renown next week?
[5:06:15] facerolljack: @Ribbwich to get access to higher ilvl loot, lets just say if you do a +20 you have access to 223 ilvl on the vendor and if you do a +10 it will be 210
[5:06:23] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob because eventually we will get gear for sneezing, and a vendor won't serve anything of use. So they go through all this pointless shit just to poop out a vendor for six weeks
[5:06:31] sigabr: twisting corridors
[5:06:36] tocu: the top layer of twisted corridor is expecting to require 215 gear
[5:06:41] sigabr: should be endless and scallable
[5:06:43] Pleau: both in darkhaven and oribos
[5:06:43] akia03: oribus
[5:06:44] Ribbwich: @facerolljack so the vendor becomes the focus, instead of doing the dungeon
[5:06:45] Bahamut145: Both, Oribos has all rep vondors
[5:06:46] danksly: for me its just math flat hours to get a new toon geared i like playing a lot of guys
[5:06:50] Bahamut145: vendors*
[5:06:57] kalamari__: they are the same vendpos
[5:06:59] Thoreya: pog
[5:07:00] Ribbwich: @facerolljack and the vault is pointless more or less
[5:07:00] kalamari__: just go oribos
[5:07:13] excessior: so once i crafted all legendaries i dont need to do torghast
[5:07:17] killtehnoob: @Ribbwich so you're fine with grinding high keys for 35 anima? You don't get a full set of gear in a week but you also don't go away empty handed. and your time is worth something then
[5:07:28] War_kebab: @Towelliee faction change him :D
[5:07:39] excessior: high keys should give more than 35 anima
[5:07:41] facerolljack: @Ribbwich yes because doing the dungeon gives you nothing, idk if you have done any dungeons but if you are unlucky you can do keys for 12 hours and not see a single piece of item and dont tell me that 35 anima is a great reward
[5:07:52] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob I take content slow, and anima will get to the point where it's ridiculous too.
[5:08:07] niko_firehawkings: in my opinion sl is too casual feeling for me
[5:08:14] akia03: so you get carried in a high key and the rest of the season you can just buy gigh itemlvl gear
[5:08:15] Ardailec: Honestly I think specifically the 35 Anima for M+ Dungeons is the big reason why there is such a stink about it.

[5:08:19] timmythegamertv: Get Pika too towel
[5:08:21] Ribbwich: @facerolljack RNG is part of the genre, I am sorry you didn't get loot, but that's not a basis to change an entire system on
[5:08:30] tocu: or just more anima like 35 anima for a wq when there are or 150s for the same amount of time
[5:08:31] Apheelia: I actually liked doing world quests in BFA
[5:08:34] killtehnoob: yeah, that's not a valid argument for the rest of the community to be shit on by rngesus.
[5:08:35] Ardailec: It's just such a bitter "Welp, too bad" feeling to get it.
[5:08:51] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob could be worse, could be corruption
[5:08:52] K_Rok: a nice grind
[5:08:57] lithium364: i can already buy the 15k transmog set, feels weird
[5:08:59] Dvmaaren: ppl who find SL too casual are also ppl who play Wow 7 days a week for 16 hours a day
[5:09:02] facerolljack: @Ribbwich i'm not asking for that i'm asking for Valor points with a weekly cap so that I can get items eventually, I dont care if i have to wait 3 or 5 weeks as long as i know i will get that item guaranteed

[5:10:04] 0doz: @towelliee i still miss better gear ilvl from m+.. hope they change it
[5:10:12] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob its not a strawman, it's on topic. RNG is woven in the nature of this game. Trust me, you will get gear, and you will get anima.

[5:10:32] MrGattz: yo i STILL havnt got a neck from ANY dungeon since heroic. i had to buy my 200 neck with conquest.
[5:10:38] excessior: maybe also have less varieties of anima, i get like 5 different ones which take up pointless bag space
[5:10:59] nocturnal_2195: me
[5:11:03] Ardailec: Every damn time man.
[5:11:03] cheersfordoobies: how many times have we all screamed YAY ANIMAAA
[5:11:03] Ribbwich: M+ should drop more loot, but, a vendor isn't the play here
[5:11:04] revve_: thats me alright
[5:11:04] railroad10989: thats me
[5:11:04] bukka_hot: can the same person get the 2 items ?
[5:11:05] Vladimirror: yes
[5:11:06] Deadlynedly: but thats a good thing compared to bfa no?
[5:11:07] Skizzurp: yea m+ gears feels super bad
[5:11:12] Jeffblute88: nothing but anima for the last 10 keys i have done. it is a huge feels bad
[5:11:16] ashton_youbooty: then it's a piece you don't need
[5:11:17] railroad10989: since i have to pug all my m+
[5:11:31] akia03: next to bolvar
[5:11:34] Recruitie: @Towelliee opposite side of the pvp vendors
[5:11:36] MrGattz: @Towelliee all it gives you is a pair of pants 200illv
[5:11:39] akia03: left side of room
[5:11:40] xgombie: nope 35 anima
[5:11:41] Molvonos: Room to the left of Bolvar
[5:11:41] stawky_: south in the enclave
[5:11:42] ExigentMidnight: They're tucked away in a corner
[5:11:42] KingSlayerYotam: they are on the other side of pvp vendors
[5:11:43] MrGattz: its not a full set
[5:11:45] ArctosPrime: anticlockwise from bolvar
[5:11:46] KingSlayerYotam: same room
[5:11:46] kalamari__: they are all 5 on the same spot
[5:11:47] D1Chile: like left of bolvar room
[5:11:54] danksly: less haste WutFace
[5:11:54] revve_: or a conduit PogChamp FeelsBadMan
[5:11:59] excessior: if i get a piece i dont need i know i wont get loot in the next couple of runs
[5:12:00] ylcard: or a duplicate conduit xD
[5:12:05] TELEVlSION: pvp gearing for sure for satisfying
[5:12:08] Ribbwich: @Towelliee they should put M+ loot behind renown kappa
[5:12:15] D1Chile: @Towelliee oopsite side from bolvar pvp vendoir
[5:12:21] Masqerader: also they need to fix the missions tables. fucking night fae
[5:12:26] Epiclurker27893: quatermaster are down past the venthyr people

[5:12:42] Molvonos: @Towelliee Nah homie, I sent you that pet, it's preleveled to 25
[5:13:09] Ribbwich: there are loads of better roads to gear people up outside of a system we used in 2008

[5:13:40] Ribbwich: @Towelliee enjoy your horse!
[5:13:42] killtehnoob: I'm not sure how more RNG is the answer over some sort of steady reward (Vendors) that lets players progress. It worked just fine in BC and WOTLK.

[5:19:45] swampt1l: it was 130 for FYS @Towelliee
[5:19:58] CADZtv: peices 132 and fsy 114
[5:20:10] excessior: seems ppl get sire down quicker than generals
[5:20:12] cronymahoney: FSY 114
[5:20:32] swampt1l: FSY are so good
[5:20:41] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob and adding a vendor now will make any new world content pointless because you can just grind the new currency in dungens
[5:21:10] killtehnoob: @Ribbwich You're making too many strawman arguments, no one is saying anything about ilevel. That's not relevant to the conversation nor does it answer how it made gear irrelevant in BC.
[5:21:14] tocu: the 158 doesnt match with the difficualty of this dungeon it feels harder than heroic by a sizable margin

[5:21:42] CADZtv: no its not
[5:21:45] Xx_Jiggawattz_xX: tru dat
[5:21:54] CADZtv: no one cares about wow esports
[5:22:00] CADZtv: its just world first raiding
[5:22:03] anithics: ty jaymurcs
[5:22:30] killtehnoob: @Ribbwich No one is arguing for a vendor right this second, if you put a vendor in now or later it gives people incentive to run dungeons, which wouldn't gear them up in a day, and makes it more rewarding than running them for weeks with no gear you need.
[5:22:36] Fireahwk: FSY is a such a bunch of legends
[5:22:59] CADZtv: is world first raiding an esport?
[5:23:01] anithics: that would be amazing
[5:23:04] Tyr7: Method will catch up, they already have financial support I think
[5:23:15] anithics: it for sure is jaymurcs

[5:23:26] cronymahoney: *that
[5:23:34] Fireahwk: Yes and only raid decent hours
[5:23:38] cronymahoney: yes
[5:23:39] Ribbwich: @killtehnoob I mean sure, a vendor later maybe? I just think its a dumb idea when there are more paths to gear we can do. I am not pro status quo atm, but, the "I didn't get gear after X amount of things" isn't really a rationale to change the way we get gear
[5:23:49] cronymahoney: and for classic
[5:23:50] swampt1l: Kungen LUL

[5:27:26] Scubaskot: @Tyr7 really? i just did heroic sire with a pug, not semi guild run, full pug
[5:27:32] anithics: people are saying heroic denath is really a step up
[5:27:32] TheUnknowing: I think every one should have known that it wouldn't happen, just cause at this point we should all know Kungen and what he goes through, so.
[5:27:38] anithics: currently 5/10 h
[5:27:47] excessior: more ppl killed m shriekwing than h sire
[5:28:00] Tyr7: @Scubaskot yep I meant US btw, think EU has lot more

[8:21:23] Sollice: I understand. I think @TMMOOF Thought just him having a valueable card was the the tax write off. Actually if he had it appraised and didn't donate it it would go to his taxable income
