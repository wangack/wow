[1:16:13] Aro725: @hammack52 then just play crusading, the damage is way worse than templars even when working. If youre not mythic raiding / pushing high end content who cares about a 3 percent dps loss
[1:17:05] Aro725: @realnzall its easier to never have to press a generator, less brain power involved. you just auto gen holy power
