[0:55:32] bigtilter: its assumed for any top 100 player that you can parse well
[0:55:33] uncontrollable_bladder: Having looked at how most guilds recruit, parses are the only thing that they look at.
[0:55:50] Primable: I went from a world 1100 guild to world 47th guild this tier and im so excited to push
[0:56:00] uncontrollable_bladder: Exactly. If a guild cares about your parses, they're bad, but that's 99.9% of guilds.
[0:56:07] blinz: how do you get your buff debuf like that? Raven?
[0:56:17] bigtilter: @uncontrollable_bladder can i ask what guild you're in?

[0:56:30] AnnaXOXD: it doesn't take too long to improve if you put in the effort, I was grey parsing in 10.2 on hc and now I get atleast blues ( i know but it's improvement )

[0:56:40] Sannestia: yeah it can be for funsies.
[0:56:40] MilaPriest: Cheers players like you exist
[0:56:42] uncontrollable_bladder: @uncontrollable_bladder I can answer if you ask the question you mean to ask - "what is your credit/experience that you're able to talk like this?".
[0:56:42] muonz: when i recruit, parsing is just to get your foot in the door. doesn't really mean anything beyond that
[0:56:43] jessebona: I was watching that Drohgoh guy today and his guild seemed so done with mythic raiding. It looks exhausting.
[0:56:49] goilen: Parse is the reclear game, first kill parse is sus
[0:56:59] bielich132: what what should a guild check, if not parses? i mean before you trial for the guild.
[0:57:00] MilaPriest: bless you Naguura

[0:57:32] Thorian92: never had good parses in my life coz cared more about mechanics and killing bosses, still got invited to some good guilds over years and got many ces etc
[0:57:32] uncontrollable_bladder: Listen - just parse and don't die. Nobody cares about you having done the right thing UNLESS they're a good guild, and those are exceptionally rare.

[0:58:08] Psydemonic: Mother is mothering
[0:58:18] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura Yes, but proper and involved logs analysis is heavily involved. It takes me 3-4 days to give a verdict on someone (videos included). The average officer doesn't look past deaths/potions usage.
[0:58:40] wotsfortea: 96% parse means youre in the top 4% of dmg for your class on that boss though??
[0:58:41] uncontrollable_bladder: KEKW YES
[0:58:43] uncontrollable_bladder: YES KEKW
[0:58:45] MilaPriest: most cringe thing is they say parses don't matter for healing and yet they still ask for your logs kek

[0:59:03] Psydemonic: Mommy Naguura does what mommy naguura does
[0:59:04] Stashthechicken: Hmm okay I was just wondering! I parse purple for mythic (don't mean to brag sorry) but was just curious on how high I could get :)) I appreciate you giving such good advice :))
[0:59:04] uncontrollable_bladder: We've been watching the Saga on Grom's stream. It's amazing!
[0:59:17] wotsfortea: @wooxit If you die your parse wouldn't be 86% ;)
[0:59:22] MilaPriest: if they check mech sure it's not
[0:59:24] uncontrollable_bladder: But nobody checks that information.
[0:59:28] JeffCahn: pcpattWave
[0:59:34] Thorian92: if u think wcl is only parses u're just a bad player xd

[0:59:51] wooxit: @wotsfortea Well you can be 100% carried by a healer in allot of cases etc. allot of easy ways to get a good dmg log
[0:59:54] bielich132: the thing is, parse doesnt make you a good player. but most good players have very good parses

[1:00:28] MilaPriest: instead of checking the gameplay and avoidance, mechanices etc
[1:00:29] kanerix23: This is interesting, I thought parses for DPS mattered, I know you want people to do the mechanics and dont care DPS, but wouldnt you rather have a player still do good dmg even though they are doing mechanics?
[1:00:34] lazyglue_: when they check my tindral logs they see a grey number but they also see me speccing into full ST because we already had enough root players.. logs are so important :D
[1:01:07] Sannestia: even I know that if you want to look into a characters history you check the logs... you're right f the parses
[1:01:11] zizzup: lazyglue
[1:01:17] wooxit: @kanerix23 Yes 100% but you would like to check the log for multiple things not just a dmg parse
[1:01:22] zizzup: we also can see in your log t hat ur ST speeced
[1:01:22] MilaPriest: I got a friend who does 99 / 100 but I always have to pi him and he never follows mechanics :D

I was advising a W100 guild recently that they should stop with this bullshit "what we do is hard" attitude for their recruitment, since they were too picky with their recruitments. But that's just how most people are.
[1:05:27] darksource1987: Ofcourse its more important to do mechanics, else its tunnelvision
[1:05:35] bluev1king: Alive dps does more damage than dead dps
[1:05:47] nerefwow: me :)
[1:05:49] Blabyone: i play game i have fun i press buttons
[1:06:13] muonz: @uncontrollable_bladder i mean being picky isn't bad, i'm also very picky and works out fine. depends if they are good at being picky or not :)
[1:06:23] Mornex: @Blabyone I sometimes forget to press buttons
[1:06:27] Stashthechicken: For guilds do you look for world rankings or just regional ranking? @naguura
[1:06:30] Sannestia: damage and rotations are easier to teach than mechanics and staying alive in my opinion as well... despoite how dated it is
[1:06:39] muonz: @Stashthechicken regional doesnt matter
[1:06:54] uncontrollable_bladder: @uncontrollable_bladder That's not what I said at all. I was clear in saying that they were stupid-picky.
[1:07:11] sjVenom: Just bring 10man raids back so you pick your friends
[1:07:12] TotallyNotRaien: are vibe checks a thing in those guilds?
[1:07:13] Tophwow: I think it kindoff depends on the individual guilds, alot of guilds on lower ranks struggle with damage very much. This also depends on the tier though, last tier was rather bad for that for example
[1:07:26] Awieson: 57 raiders from Awieson have joined! 
[1:07:28] uncontrollable_bladder: Exactly. Motivation & willingness to time-sink is 90% of the equation.
[1:08:03] uncontrollable_bladder: @Kuroz Whatchu doin', bud? Susge
[1:08:12] biekdafreak: is elvui necessary
[1:08:25] Tophwow: @biekdafreak No not at all
[1:08:26] Axestro: @biekdafreak no - it's a matter of preference.
[1:08:30] muonz: that's also why I never poach players, they tend to be lower-motivation and not as committed
[1:08:34] uncontrollable_bladder: @biekdafreak Not necessarily Elv, but UnitFrames that show things properly are, yes.
[1:08:41] Tophwow: @biekdafreak Performance wise Elvui is actually not that great
[1:08:42] bielich132: thats not wrong at all :D i was raiding CE for years. and mostly i knew my job and not the whole bossfight xD
[1:08:47] wooxit: Doesnt that just tell the raiding has become 2 easy?? since you can have 2 many people in the raid not having a clue and yet defeat it :P
[1:08:50] biekdafreak: i use titan and bartender
[1:09:02] xstren: group effort so yeh, if someone doesnt prepare, its going to likely hurt the entire group. not worth bringing that person.
[1:09:02] Stashthechicken: For guilds do you look for world rankings or just regional? Sorry for spam :(
[1:09:02] andontv: warum bist du immer so schick gekleidet wenn du zockst :D
[1:09:02] goilen: We are still wiping to people panic clearing roots on Tindral, not thinking of the raid damage - don't care how much dps they do if they wipe the raid.
[1:09:03] StarshineWindlord: also dead does barely any dps ;p
[1:09:06] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura Dude, all you're saying makes no sense, except almost no officers thinks like this, and it's just parses + the vibe check, then they end up in shambles.
[1:09:11] uncontrollable_bladder: makes sense*
[1:09:33] Tophwow: Its a matter of work ethic imo
[1:09:48] Tophwow: a person who is really good at one thing can get good at another thing if they put in the effort
[1:09:52] loreppa_: Do you suggest start playing dragon right now
[1:10:02] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:10:25] uncontrollable_bladder: Ok, can you convince 90%++ of officers to think like this, especially given they're gonna jump mad world ranks if they do? :)
[1:10:41] biekdafreak: you have profession points
[1:10:44] danzo1989: hi caroline:)
[1:10:44] Jack_the_Dipper: You have the effort part
[1:10:50] muonz: @uncontrollable_bladder easier world ranks for me :) keep them thinking like that
[1:10:57] ssj_fajita: ive been watching your stream for some time now i dont follow you but i like you, if i followed you would you consider getting to know the best mmo player to ever play mmo's
[1:11:05] Stashthechicken: For guilds do you look for world rankings or just regional rankings matter?
[1:11:08] goevenfurtherbeyond: also it's always 2500 rio players not seeing giant orbs following them on m smolderon
[1:11:17] Jack_the_Dipper: Hey how the new mics for the kitchen?
[1:11:23] uncontrollable_bladder: @goevenfurtherbeyond Did you mean to say 3.5k?
[1:11:24] Jack_the_Dipper: Im curious
[1:11:25] bigtilter: @Stashthechicken only NA guilds care about regional rankings, everyone in EU uses world ranks
[1:11:35] uncontrollable_bladder: High-rated: ~3.8k
[1:11:37] Stashthechicken: Ohh I seee
[1:11:42] Tophwow: Like title rating
[1:11:48] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura IT'S PUSH WEEEEEK
[1:11:50] Axestro: @uncontrollable_bladder It's hard as an officer to know if anyone is good without looking at metrics like parses. Even with parses you need to take a chance on anyone trialing for your raid roster.
[1:11:51] goevenfurtherbeyond: @uncontrollable_bladder 3500 rio players will surely notice them
[1:12:02] uncontrollable_bladder: You can press W to 3.7k, literally.
[1:12:14] bluev1king: Kungen to hire someone to his guild he checks logs for next expansion first
[1:12:14] antirace: sup Naguuraaaaa!
[1:12:17] Its_Just_Pete: agreed
[1:12:17] Tophwow: Oh yeah thats also a good point. Time is not effort
[1:12:21] goevenfurtherbeyond: yeah that's what im saying
[1:12:22] muonz: @goevenfurtherbeyond nah i've played with r1 m+ players that we had to kick for being bad in raid
[1:12:28] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura This is exactly why M+ isn't enjoyable right now. Free gear and score.
[1:12:34] uncontrollable_bladder: You go into a 27/28, and see demons.
[1:12:51] Stashthechicken: Dang I was about to ask if you thought 3
[1:12:53] goevenfurtherbeyond: @muonz thats fkced up xddd
[1:12:55] MilaPriest: @muonz being a raid and m+ player isn't the same, makes sense :P
[1:12:56] J1nxi_: m+ without a team is demotivating
[1:13:05] ssj_fajita: now i have to follow, im actually the best mmo player of all time and most /played wow player of all time, got stats to prove it, not am i a parser but im a gentlemen
[1:13:06] Stashthechicken: If you thought 3.5k is good :(
[1:13:08] Saiko135: But isn't it also a kind of effort to invest so much time in M+?
[1:13:08] ssj_fajita: and a scholar
[1:13:10] loreppa_: This is how you play wow and enjoy it
[1:13:11] xstren: some parts become muscle memory, but if asked to explain it: Thinkge
[1:13:17] MilaPriest: @J1nxi_ ommggg she's here <3
[1:13:25] darksource1987: <3
[1:13:26] wooxit: putting in effort with pugs is horrible tho^^
[1:13:29] samsamshow: what guild are you raiding with?
[1:13:34] Kuroz: !guild
[1:13:35] StreamElements: https://raider.io/guilds/eu/tarren-mill/Myst
[1:13:35] MilaPriest: @J1nxi_ and yes !
[1:13:37] mace_ch: go pub keys
[1:13:40] mellebel93: i have 3.3 k rio and dot have a lot of time to play bc of kids and work.. but yeah i put a lot of efford in it..
[1:13:45] J1nxi_: @MilaPriest hellooo!! j1nxiLOVE
[1:13:51] YeDHtv: @J1nxi_ True + based + bis priest
[1:13:56] nppp: Max said that he would rather recruit a high rio player than mythic raider because they are usually mechanically better, makes sense
[1:14:22] goevenfurtherbeyond: also im doing 24-25 keys atm, there are players who can do it while sleeping basically and others struggle to stack on volkaal in ad etc
[1:14:29] goevenfurtherbeyond: the gap is huge
[1:14:32] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[1:14:33] MilaPriest: @J1nxi_ VirtualHug VirtualHug VirtualHug
[1:14:43] Zeuzo: there it should be M+ solo q like arena
[1:14:46] J1nxi_: naguuraFlower
[1:14:47] Stashthechicken: Do you think 3
[1:14:54] Tophwow: The thing is that you need to put in the time and the effort first, in m+ specifically. If you get to a high rating once and you get to know people, even if you dont have a team people recognize you and take you to keys more
[1:14:57] Stashthechicken: Do you think 3.5k is decent?
[1:14:58] Zeuzo: i log in...get declined 2 hours straight and log off
[1:15:02] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:15:09] YeDHtv: @Zeuzo Solo q would be nightmare, triple boomie or WL it's joever
[1:15:09] goilen: I think in M+ there's a diff of time/effort between dps and healer/tank. It's much easier to get score as dps by trying until you get lucky than as a healer/tank because you can time a key with one dps slacking but kinda hard with tank slacking.
[1:15:13] Tophwow: The first time getting to high rating is the hardest
[1:15:13] MilaPriest: @Zeuzo :( never give up
[1:15:38] Entelligenz: @tophwow yup
[1:15:39] ssj_fajita: if you were to let me into your dm's i would text you good morning as i wake up and good night as i goto bed (which i2-3 times a week)
[1:15:47] Zeuzo: @YeDHtv  better than jumping in town...and geting declined for 2 hours straight
[1:15:50] lucifame: what is even considered a high rating?
[1:15:52] Sannestia: yeah people make fun of me for how obsessive I am about my UI ... I like it pretty and functional for me.
[1:15:57] mellebel93: exactly bc either way what u play u need to learn your clas.. and maximize it
[1:15:59] Tenivir: bnrLookup uhm
[1:15:59] goevenfurtherbeyond: meta slavery also impacts too much lower keys
[1:16:08] xstren: @ssj_fajita slide in m dms bb
[1:16:27] YeDHtv: @Zeuzo I was that guy last season, i'd rather sit wait for ques then perma deplete because doomed comp from start
[1:16:44] uncontrollable_bladder: If they ever introduced losing score for M+, it'll die in an instant.
[1:16:52] nilknarf_tv: in m+ you only lose time
[1:16:57] Tenivir: Nerdge actually i believe i could deplete them all
[1:16:58] nppp: @Zeuzo no idea how people do it without being premade unless they stream, its insane how much time you lose by sitting in valdrakken
[1:17:04] J1nxi_: decay system would be so interesting to see what would happen xD
[1:17:09] Tophwow: @YeDHtv Yes but there is also a difference between having a doomed comp and not meta
[1:17:13] lindbart: sometimes when i see people in  keys what are doing they should lose score:DD
[1:17:16] c0ruscare: "It's almost impossible to deplete every key" - Hold my bear please
[1:17:18] Stashthechicken: Do you think 3.5k is decent? @naguura
[1:17:18] Zeuzo: @nppp  i agree
[1:17:18] theskot: decay would drive people crazier than they already are at high lvls
[1:17:21] Entelligenz: @ssj_fajita thats when the 400 keys heroes come into play that are barely above title KEKW
[1:17:33] uncontrollable_bladder: 3.5k is below "press W" level.
[1:17:45] Zeuzo: end game = jump in valdraken until u get accepted in a grp
[1:17:47] ssj_fajita: @Naguura and i dont like you comparing me to asmongold or kungen as im not as egotisitical as them, im a real guy went to colllege and am cultured
[1:17:48] Zeuzo: seems realy stupid
[1:17:49] MLuke57: I wish to get more ppl in my guild with your mindset lol
[1:17:50] uncontrollable_bladder: 3.7k is respectable.
[1:18:09] xstren: @uncontrollable_bladder ok
[1:18:35] Zeuzo: they should let u do keys like in test server...any key any lvl
[1:18:42] TotallyNotRaien: @ssj_fajita has picking up female streamers ever worked for you?
[1:18:49] uncontrollable_bladder: now i have to follow, im actually the best mmo player of all time and most /played wow player of all time, got stats to prove it, not am i a parser but im a gentlemen
[1:18:50] Axestro: @uncontrollable_bladder That's not a very objective statement. To some people reaching KSM in a season is a stretch goal, and respectable.
[1:18:50] rykhasa: Chatting
[1:19:00] Sannestia: LUL omg.
[1:19:07] TheEmoira: any body else having issues with campfire drop time not working?
[1:19:12] penned_apollo: naguuraWut
[1:19:19] bluenurse13: @ssj_fajita lmfao
[1:19:23] rykhasa: I refuse to believe this is not copypasta
[1:19:25] uncontrollable_bladder: Give this man VIP for the good copypasta.
[1:19:27] Jack_the_Dipper: wuh? kaatXD
[1:19:28] rykhasa: I need to believe that for my sanity
[1:19:28] goevenfurtherbeyond: @ssj_fajita ripbozo
[1:19:34] EtherealFidelity: @TheEmoira yee :(
[1:19:41] Jack_the_Dipper: I see a lof of top raiders like you not using ELVUI. Is there a reason not to use it? @Naguura
[1:19:43] nppp: how will you move on in your life without him? rip
[1:19:45] sim967: haha
[1:20:02] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:20:09] laedine: If you could play any other dps regardless of meta - what would you play?
[1:20:13] TheEmoira: @EtherealFidelity You too :(
[1:20:14] Tophwow: @Jack_the_Dipper Elvui is often worse performance wise
[1:20:20] Jack_the_Dipper: aaah
[1:20:23] rykhasa: ElvUI is really annoying if you want to tinker even just a little bit yourself
[1:20:35] Jack_the_Dipper: @tophwow yeah I heard it an cause fps drops
[1:20:38] Sannestia: I use ElvUI... =/
[1:20:41] darksource1987: Im looking for simple weakauro to display special abilitys in m+ Dungeons. I dont need to have million bars and text etc from a big package. Any tips?
[1:20:45] TotallyNotRaien: really? ive tinkered a lot of my elvui really easily
[1:20:57] uncontrollable_bladder: @uncontrollable_bladder I'm speaking of how hard it is for 99.9% of healthy human beings to reach that point, assuming they have the time.
[1:21:01] SaosinTV: @darksource1987 figure out how to make ur own
[1:21:12] rykhasa: @TotallyNotRaien YMMV ofc but I just prefer to start from the bottom on my own, rather than working backwards
[1:21:18] Asuriuz: @TotallyNotRaien its not impossible, but if youre going to change stuff might aswell not use elvui
[1:21:23] Tophwow: Getting your own UI is more work initially but then you have something perfect for you
[1:21:35] SamsonautEU: are u casting MDI again this season? :D
[1:21:40] Kuroz: @SamsonautEU she is
[1:21:43] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatHmm okay
[1:21:46] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura Shameless plug? WeirdDude
[1:21:47] Sannestia: honestly... I only switched when the original Grid was poofed. I like the ElvUI's party frames.
[1:22:01] rykhasa: But what about DwarfUI?
[1:22:04] antonimated: !discord
[1:22:05] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/naguura
[1:22:05] darksource1987: @saosintv i can but don't want to 😀
[1:22:19] uncontrollable_bladder: [naowh did not like that]
[1:22:24] VipMalis: its easier to turn of things then building up from scratch
[1:22:27] Tophwow: Just getting elvui is probably not the pick, if you want a good starting point you can get a custom ui that probably uses elvui and then you adjust it yourself
[1:22:28] SamsonautEU: problem is, I have no idea what I need in an ui
[1:22:41] xstren: @SamsonautEU add things as you figure out what you need then
[1:22:44] Elembry_us: Hey everyone! Happy reset day NA players. I hope your vaults are good to you.
[1:22:45] Ollowains: i mean for like the average player, who dont want to stick time into UI.-building elvui should be fine right?
[1:22:51] Ragnorekt: I saw this on tiktok but doesn’t naguura remind you of a Randalekobolt?
[1:22:58] Tophwow: And when youre at the point where you know how you want it yourself you can start making your own UI
[1:23:17] Jack_the_Dipper: Im mainly looking for a replacement of SUF addon because it stopped updating with at 10.5 and I noticed some bugs. I use it for my own bar and party/raid aand some said II should go ELVUI
[1:23:18] uncontrollable_bladder: Just get a $7k PC, or?
[1:23:19] Tophwow: @Ollowains In that case I would recommend getting Naowhs or Atrocities UI
[1:23:19] bluenurse13: @ssj_fajita sounding like Josh from Method
[1:23:22] Schmosch1: I am a certified elvui hater
[1:23:23] rykhasa: LUL absolutely sent
[1:23:34] Sannestia: like you said. it takes up extra pc stuff. still takes as long to fiddle with ElvUI as it does with custom things
[1:23:47] Sannestia: I'm lucky to have the PC that can handle it
[1:23:48] Tophwow: Yeh but It will maybe go from 40 fps to 30 fps and at that point its already fucked KEKW
[1:24:20] Jack_the_Dipper: trrue

[1:24:33] Sannestia: I hate the OG WoW UI... so yeah I'm just a picky brat. LUL
[1:24:42] Jack_the_Dipper: Im mainly looking for a replacement of SUF addon because it stopped updating with at 10.5 and I noticed some bugs. I use it for my own bar and party/raid and some said I should go ELVUI @Naguura

[1:25:02] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:25:07] BananaCatRun: yeah im still on ElvUI just for how nice the raid and party frames are
[1:25:14] Tophwow: Most stuff is usually handled with weakauras anyways
[1:25:23] Melithian: This is me. I used elvui for many years, but then when DF dropped, I gave the base UI a chance and I wouldn't go back. I have some WAs to customize stuff or some other minor addons to add stuff, but in the long run, base UI is fine
[1:25:28] zebracak35: adibags is goat though
[1:25:31] valeconya: u cant move the window duh
[1:25:35] seamuscg: @zebracak35 getting discontinued :)
[1:25:39] Sannestia: I hate the blizzard ui look. it's ugly... LUL
[1:26:06] Jack_the_Dipper: I do still use Bangon so I can move the bag frame
[1:26:11] Schmosch1: yeah the standard ui player and target frame look kinda uggyyy
[1:26:14] Jack_the_Dipper: bagnon*
[1:26:17] Schmosch1: rest looks quite nice now
[1:26:18] zebracak35: @seamuscg No sho tsomeone doesnt pick it up
[1:26:19] rykhasa: the nameplates took a step back tbh but otherwise DF was a big win
[1:26:25] Sannestia: I use Plater for nameplates so like yeah I get the no-ElvUI idea.
[1:26:28] Melithian: Nameplates were a big oversight in the base UI revamp. Hope they come back to it
[1:26:39] LillMait: @Naguura Is it possible to compete in RWF without addons or is addons a must? thidparty program to even play the game?
[1:26:46] Gih_87: poor name plates, they're the ones that get the most hate, from everybody
[1:26:50] TotallyNotRaien: they said they couldnt change name plates it was too big an undertaking
[1:26:51] xstren: yeh. with the new UI i more or less only need plater and weakauras.
[1:26:56] Stashthechicken: !song
[1:26:57] StreamElements: Current Song: Labrinth - No Ordinary
[1:27:01] Streitix23: raid Frames on Standard need more customization options in my opinion - they just lack a bit at that
[1:27:06] Tophwow: You always want plater, unless blizzard makes it so you literally have plater functionality in the base UI
[1:27:13] Melithian: There's a limit on what Blizzard can do, yeah
[1:27:19] chaarp: they would need to add custom colors and scripting to their nameplates
[1:27:21] darksource1987: Is it possible with big wigs to only show Emphasized bars and not normal bars @naguura
[1:27:23] Melithian: People will always want to customize further
[1:27:33] Sannestia: I think what I stopped at with my UI currently... was frames. I want a font in there but haven't had time to just look up and fix the font not showing up
[1:27:40] Tophwow: They COULD but they wont
[1:27:41] rykhasa: I can't help myself cracking up from that soundbite KEKW
[1:27:42] Tophwow: Yeh
[1:27:43] rykhasa: every time
[1:27:59] Schmosch1: If u just run heroic dungeons and stuff u don't need nameplates. x) so they probably wont do it
[1:28:03] brockusgames: can have a simple mode, like windows calculator has normal and scientific
[1:28:08] xstren: just put them under "Advanced", ez. but yeah if plater keeps existing blizz doesnt need to waste the dev time.
[1:28:17] astreinoid: they did restrict customization in legion and removed the friendly ones further in raid hthough
[1:28:35] bayhie: Hello, do you think I could run WOW at ultra settings with rtx4050 laptop?
[1:29:01] iStreamSunday: Happy Tuesday from Sunday!
[1:29:17] brockusgames: got enough on their 'plate'
[1:29:19] Tophwow: They would literally have to enable scripts and mods in the base UI which is honestly kinda sus especially for less experienced players
[1:29:23] Sannestia: and why would they do it from a business and monetary standpoint
[1:29:31] Fellow90: Hey Caro, what do you think of the owl's current situation? Would you say everything is acceptable in Raid and M+? And is the newly selected upcoming set a push for us or unfortunately the opposite?
[1:29:43] uncontrollable_bladder: @bayhie No, even on 1080p. I tested extensively. Should publish those graphs.
[1:30:02] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:30:02] uncontrollable_bladder: Well, it depends on your target FPS. If it's 60, sure.
[1:30:17] Axestro: They did edit mode though. And that was also just one addon away.
[1:30:27] Sannestia: I've had a small buisness for a long time... I drive my husband when I tell him how things make sense from a business point of view when he just wants support XD
[1:30:40] Tophwow: Moonkin is like one of the worst dps except for on council
[1:30:42] Sannestia: RIP moonkin.
[1:30:43] konradoo303: @naguura Hey Carol what headphones are you using 👀⁉️
[1:30:44] AbieCherry: Canexx thinks moonkin in raid is fine
[1:30:51] bayhie: @uncontrollable_bladder Is it OK if you whisper me and I ask you some questions?

[1:33:42] uncontrollable_bladder: @uncontrollable_bladder You want a processor (Intel) that clocks very high single-core. There's this myth that was propagated by Nnoggie (not his fault, and he took it back) where the X3D outperforms the i9-13/4900K, but that's just false. The i9 clocks SUPER high single-core, and that's exactly what WoW likes, because its engine runs 90% of the things on ~4 cores total.

[3:05:52] thundork: @t0ny1992 imo mw is very good for key pugging, only issue is you dont have any cds other than cocoon for your squishes otherwise throughput and damage is really good, survivability and utility is really good too
[3:06:07] TotallyNotRaien: only my tastes are logical and expected
[3:06:08] uncontrollable_bladder: I think there is definitely a reasonable worry if you're doing M+ just for score, and you get your self-actualization from it.

[3:44:06] uncontrollable_bladder: @MooniexVibes Absolutely isn't, and remaining calm in the face of stupid adversity is actually a lie of religion, touted as "mental fortitude". It's one thing to remain calm in tense situations where the sides of the problem have a reasonable claim, it's another to stay calm just for the sake of it when children are arguing over stupid shit.

[3:58:11] maulwurf90: do you get like 100€ or more like 50.000€?
[3:58:57] Xastin3: so you say apartment is it condo?
[3:59:16] Xastin3: oh yeah they get it back in some way
[3:59:18] Virelo: its prolly just americans who are too stupid to realize the government helping them with their own money they pay in taxes isnt sOcIaLisM
[3:59:22] MrAxeffect: in return you stay in the area and spend money and pay taxes
[3:59:22] Neztea: exactly, u pay all this via taxes
[3:59:58] Kahlandra: wow your government gives you everything for free? thats so cool
[3:59:59] ValkyW: its to give ppl money when they need it i guess and everyone pays taxes to help with that
[4:00:00] Mikey1678: "here have 2% of the money u paid in taxes back"
[4:00:13] blaisle: Sure, you are right, but apartments are currently one of the most vivid problem of young ppl. In my country (which is in EU) earning average salary wont let you buy a house ever
[4:00:15] djthedan123: is mage this bad or its just this guy

[4:01:41] JohnAllenCasts: we could do a channel point redemption and you get a house
[4:02:02] Andersonmps: Its crazy how expensive housing are those days
[4:02:13] y0rge: why people expect to buy new apartment in age 30  with avg income in 2023/24
[4:02:13] Andersonmps: Everywhere in the world
[4:02:21] greypapi: In my country they introduced 2% goverment sponsored credit to buy Your first apartment, only thing that did was raise prices 15-20% on 2nd hand market xD

[4:03:10] djthedan123: @HeffaBear wtf really?
[4:03:11] DonPussi: Wondering how much government aid inflates the costs of those same appartments
[4:03:26] nevernude1: time for a new donation goal
[4:03:37] Varahiilxs: you can build a nice house for the dog at least KEKW
[4:03:37] Andersonmps: Mind control the incorp in thin fight is op
[4:03:44] Xastin3: were building apartments in usa there costing us 60-70k a unit.
[4:03:46] highning: prices are so scuffed. in hamburg (germany) outskirts you pay almost 1 mio for a 1000 sqm property WITHOUT a house
[4:03:47] Foggie: Bought my house in 2018 for 160k. But I also live in West Bumfuck KEKW
[4:03:51] TotallyNotRaien: donpussi probably not as much as just people who own the housing being greedy

[4:04:54] Andersonmps: Its crazy how expensive housing are those days, Everywhere in the world
[4:05:08] nevernude1: Any oil barons wanna donate 700k so she has a place to live?
[4:05:12] y0rge: cus everyoen need one
[4:05:20] DonPussi: @TotallyNotRaien I'm not sure what the link between the two is, but the government aid definitely drives up the cost of housing

[4:05:41] uncontrollable_bladder: Wouldn't those still be 300-400k?
[4:05:55] Elembry_us: It's a seller's market which sucks. Our house has gone up in property value, but to get a new house that is an "upgrade" would cost us nearly $400k. It's ridiculous.
[4:06:07] Kahlandra: i bought my house 8 years ago and honestly got so lucky lol
[4:06:11] Tophwow: Buy groceries

[4:07:24] Elembry_us: @Foggie It's rough. And interest rates are through the roof.
[4:07:37] Xastin3: anytime someone makes offer on my house i basically 2x number i want cause replacing loan would be near impossible
[4:07:54] ChappyAir: could somebody explain incoporeal to me? what am I supposed to do when the enemies spawn?
[4:07:57] Foggie: @elembryus as they should be, they were too low for too long. luckily I went modest with my house so the interest increase didnt hit me as hard as it did others

[4:09:49] nevernude1: That is nice of you
[4:10:07] quenvin: You can get a 189 sq meter house here with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths for $299.9k
[4:10:09] Foggie: @zebracak35 yeah thats true, i just feel sorry for the inexperienced that loaned to the max when it was at its lowest and now suffering the consequenses
[4:10:19] Andersonmps: Why these dragons aoe hut so much?! Geez

[4:20:10] Andersonmps: Just dont queue for endgame content if you dont have the time for it
[4:20:11] NkKouros: They don't care enough to learn the key but care enough to queue to 25
[4:20:14] Foggie: @valeriedhx what mage dmg
[4:20:24] Andersonmps: Stay in the casual lane
[4:20:27] javajunky001: Gamer girl :D
[4:20:33] ghantous: yeah people think 29+ is high keys when less then 2% of the population of wow does 22+
[4:20:34] Xantoszz: Carry me through a 30 please, I don't even know what the trash does
[4:20:49] Bret36: Just stay the fuck outta my keys

[4:20:54] Shimeria1: Nagura do you want to do +27 rise?
[4:21:08] branzdeadtv: I mean casual players shouldn't be in 25s or higher
[4:21:12] Varahiilxs: they can with gold KEKW
[4:21:12] Andersonmps: Thats why my highest key this season was a +16. I dont have the time tu put effort on higher
[4:21:14] ichibanza: REALIST not elitist
[4:21:19] MosesFox1: anyway, you theyd reach those key lvls playing 10m a day? smells like boost
[4:21:23] nappingdwarf: ohh wait is 26 end game content?

[4:21:57] gambleragain: @Naguura that why classic has more appeal to these players, the endgame is there for them. If echo clears a classic raid, they do as well.
[4:22:10] Xastin3: its just wow gave casuals enough gear to get to 20-25. however health bars support playing content casually
[4:22:19] Andersonmps: @Foggie FOR SURE. As a Ret pally is brtual to find higher keys
[4:22:22] stormstryke666: How dare you... Me and my 25 kids are going to watch another streamer

[4:22:31] dhuckla: I was able to heal and time a WC 21 in vet and champion gear last time
[4:22:32] Mirunelle: @gambleragain not to be the guy but classic is also very grindy for endgame?
[4:22:33] Foggie: @Andersonmps cries in dps warrior
[4:22:45] broskeleton: @eldurian Tomorrow
[4:22:45] Xastin3: s1 was great
[4:22:53] eldurian: @broskeleton ty
[4:22:54] Andersonmps: @Foggie I feel your pain
[4:22:56] sim967: yup
[4:23:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:23:07] gambleragain: @Mirunelle grindy yes, doable very doable, casuals love the grind, as long as they can acess it
[4:23:31] Xantoszz: Hey survival hunter isn't that bad
[4:23:42] Emberil: 2lvls below is r1
[4:23:46] Mirunelle: @gambleragain maybe so, to me casual usually means they're not going to put 12 hours a day into the game though
[4:23:51] NkKouros: The highest key in the world also required the 5 best players with perfect gameplay lmao
[4:23:51] Emberil: feral was super op in s1 tho :D
[4:24:04] Emberil: probably was a prime time gaming for feral
[4:24:04] summit_iceotope: do you play hardcore?
[4:24:11] Kuroz: nope
[4:24:16] xhawrill: sucks coming back mid season
[4:24:24] Xantoszz: I miss Shadowlands Survival Hunter
[4:24:24] broskeleton: I pay 13€ per month, I sohuld be able to do more DPS than tanks when playing boomkin just because I pay 13€, buff moonkin Kappa
[4:24:30] ghantous: every key lvl is 10% harder so even if the "meta" is 10% better it will do only 1 key level higher and the spread between "meta and non "meta" is smaller then 10%
[4:24:37] Xastin3: feral wasnt played on live keys
[4:24:54] gambleragain: @Mirunelle I can agree. But it also has evolved to the point of accessability. Imagine how a noob feels when they pay for the Dragonflight game, but they're skill capped to where they can't acess high M+ rating, or mythic raiding.
[4:24:54] Fallen_o7: you get invite so easy :D im 3550 mage getting no invites i dunno why
[4:25:06] Andersonmps: @xhawrill There's an catch up gear system now. You can trade the flight stones for gear
[4:25:08] meepowns: !s3
[4:25:09] StreamElements: Is damage in M+ too high ? -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmdb5KZLBhk
[4:25:16] uncontrollable_bladder: Buy a boost FeelsOkayMan
[4:25:20] Emberil: @Naguura I pushed r1 on both balance and feral and cant say what was better, however feral was incredibly fun to play and refreshing after years on moonkin in keys
[4:25:28] meepowns: what happen to wow , new season soon?
[4:25:41] Zagor2099: Thank you for the grim camp-fire  😀
[4:25:48] uncontrollable_bladder: There's actually no other way to do it
[4:25:55] wulfgang71: why not just make your own keys?
[4:25:58] barebackentry: Buy till 2k?
[4:26:03] foggyfr: just make your own grps with your keystone and grind that out. Way easier
[4:26:17] whisperlude: You dont need to buy a boost... just play the game. Find a community/guild where you can get better with them
[4:26:21] Spikeel: just make ur own keys. Dont buy boost xD
[4:26:22] gambleragain: Well, im currently hard stuck at 3100 rating. An endless loop of depletes because of bad players.
[4:26:22] Xantoszz: I can't buy a boost, I have 50 kids to feed
[4:26:23] wulfgang71: i got to 3k with no issues just running my own key
[4:26:25] Mikey1678: do u get a title for 3k io?
[4:26:39] feyzu_u: how much would that cost even
[4:26:39] spicykekw: boosting should be banned
[4:26:42] uncontrollable_bladder: No, bro, you have to buy it if you're a semi-human. If you're good, you won't get to 3.5k, because you won't get invited.
[4:26:50] WwJluxor: the suggest to "buy" boost is such a call out for the shit community
[4:26:50] broskeleton: @Mikey1678 no
[4:26:50] highning: best tip: do your own keys
[4:26:52] wulfgang71: how much does a boost cost?
[4:27:01] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[4:27:06] dhezghia: just do ur own key, no? @Naguura
[4:27:17] Mikey1678: @broskeleton  whats the minimum IO to get a title
[4:27:18] k0kicata: but you can get 450 in a day no ?
[4:27:25] Andersonmps: Its also true that some classes has easier time on getting invited than others.
[4:27:30] uncontrollable_bladder: Nobody good will apply.
[4:27:32] foggyfr: is it like a couple 100k for a 20 timed ?
[4:27:34] pekman6969: i dont thin any rank1 player will buy ever aa boost
[4:27:40] Neztea: own key as pure dps is hell
[4:27:41] Xantoszz: Or be a hybrid class and do an undesired role until you get the score you want
[4:27:43] peepofeelings: its not that hard with your own keys
[4:27:45] Julowayne: i mean if u got r1 titles before there's some chances u know ppl who still play at this level
[4:27:47] Xastin3: if you post key and you 500score you dont even pop up i search for alot people
[4:27:51] zinisterzz: i dont think people in this chat value their time highly
[4:27:51] eldurian: honestly the alternative is play tank until you get like +16 in everything and then you go back to whatever role you want
[4:27:58] pax_rush: also, you gotta up the key several times a day if you deplete a few times
[4:28:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:28:10] CapriSonne90: Hey naguura, kannst du ne boost service empfehlen?
[4:28:11] foggyfr: getting to 2k rated is a joke on your own, even with shitters. Trash players are +2 20s now
[4:28:13] Kuroz: poor tom didn't get invited with 3.3k score to a 26
[4:28:16] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura You are objectively right. Don't listen to anyone in chat saying otherwise :)
[4:28:20] broskeleton: naguuraHypers
[4:28:20] pekman6969: boosting should be banned for sure
[4:28:21] dhezghia: how much does a boost cost @Naguura ill buy 1
[4:28:23] Kuroz: like 40 minutes ago
[4:28:23] voteforpedro064: how much longer is this season supposed to last?
[4:28:24] k0kicata: if we broke boys we will say so
[4:28:38] blaisle: Chat she is right xD on my alt with 2.5k rio no one applies even for 20s soo xD
[4:28:42] broskeleton: @voteforpedro064 Probably may/june?
[4:28:42] BizBichou: @Kuroz toxic behavior, everyone should automatically invite him
[4:28:44] Xastin3: it definitely makes difference. mid season.... people are picky about comps and score
[4:28:47] Xantoszz: Chat we all just need to start streaming to get streamer benefits when applying for keys
[4:28:49] gambleragain: Personally I'm still learning. As a healer i feel like its important for me to raise the bar from 24 to 25 to test the dmg numbers.
[4:28:50] whisperlude: you're essentially telling people to pay to win lol that's why it's controversial
[4:28:53] wulfgang71: yeah for 20s u should be at like 2.8k
[4:28:55] xxxdabmaster69xxx: @Naguura would you say that seeing the rating of a player is bad for the casual community? i can see why it's important on harder keys, but sometimes it feels like it's hard to get into even small keys if you just started again :)
[4:28:58] Kuroz: @BizBichou wildigG  agreed
[4:29:01] sim967: boost just speeds it up
[4:29:03] bielich132: @whisperlude she isnt
[4:29:04] blaisle: Its controversial but its all players fault
[4:29:05] jpwastaken_: Id say that if it's ur first time you shouldnt push urself beyond what ur capable, but anyone that's achieved X high rating knows that boosting to get to the point where u feel like u at is super normal
[4:29:06] dhezghia: my addon sets group leaders with lower io on the bottom
[4:29:07] astreinoid: 2,5k rating just means you got some 17/18 done
[4:29:07] uncontrollable_bladder: Not what she said at all.
[4:29:08] Aldarana: pugging for score is just so much less efficient than playing with people you know who are good
[4:29:08] bscheur: I didn't know there were german-speaking parts of Italy---that's so cool!
[4:29:10] draosakel: @broskeleton Nah, s4 will come out in spring
[4:29:17] bielich132: but twitch chat wants to interpret stuff in the worst way :D
[4:29:17] wulfgang71: its just if you wanna get to the endgame fast
[4:29:18] ghantous: i buy on alts and sell boosts on main ive elliminated the pugging experience best decision ive made
[4:29:19] broskeleton: May is spring
[4:29:20] broskeleton: Pog
[4:29:24] pekman6969: thats why the community is dead
[4:29:26] BizBichou: @Kuroz they need to support rank 5 dps player's helaer arc angy he'll be rank 1 dps on next push week anyway angy
[4:29:29] wavetern: What did you say, I just tooned in
[4:29:32] Fiwoo: Fiwoo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:29:32] wavetern: tuned*
[4:29:35] xxTIGHTEYEZxx: Cant give out a tip without tilting people LUL
[4:29:37] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[4:29:47] Spikeel: @Naguura  and 1hr ago u said to some1 who likes fated raids "maybe just place vendors in city just to buy bis gear" KEKW
[4:30:05] theoneginger_ttv: I honestly think the grind is the most of the fun
[4:30:14] pekman6969: its literlarly pay to win xD and then the 3.4 k boosted boy is Q in my key and play like an absolute pleb
[4:30:22] kaztier: @ghantous if you sell boosts on your main wouldnt your group just run you on your alts Susge
[4:30:27] shockxbot: na, people want to missunderstand you
[4:30:32] Xastin3: boost is just to get to point so you can play at level of content you want to be playing
[4:30:39] gambleragain: basically, if you're bad dont buy it pls
[4:30:41] uncontrollable_bladder: What's so hard to understand?
[4:30:45] dhezghia: why not recommend finding friends that is free
[4:30:49] uncontrollable_bladder: Also - this is the only way to do it.
[4:30:50] Andersonmps: There's a barrier that its not the player fault
[4:30:52] Mornex: dear lord chat must be trippin
[4:30:53] Xantoszz: People just need to stop worrying about the "meta". Obviously you need to make sure the group can handle the key and mechanics but "meta" comps kill pugging
[4:31:14] wulfgang71: i get a rush of dopamine when i swipe
[4:31:18] Xastin3: its not fun have to do +21 + 22 +23 + 24 +25
[4:31:22] uncontrollable_bladder: ^
[4:31:30] Andersonmps: @Xantoszz Sadly, meta its a thing that will never dont exist
[4:31:31] ghantous: @kaztier no its not the same players that sell with me its though the boosting discords ect they arent my friends although some become yea
[4:31:31] Zirconn__: I’m back
[4:31:37] shockxbot: you can just buy 20 keys and afterwards its easy to get into keys that get played to push score
[4:31:41] nappingdwarf: its pay to skip :D
[4:31:48] uncontrollable_bladder: If you're semi-human, and you just acme back to the game, you can get to 3.7k. 100%. The problem with it is not how hard the dungeons are, but if you're getting invited...and you're not getting invited.
[4:31:54] Zirconn__: what bad takes are we trying to defend naguuraSip
[4:31:59] Xastin3: if youve never done 21 your not going to get invited to 25
[4:32:05] demonlordyakuza: ^^
[4:32:10] Andersonmps: @Zirconn__ Buying boots LUL
[4:32:22] Andersonmps: Boost*
[4:32:28] its_bean92: If youve never done a 24 your probably not getting invited to a 25
[4:32:30] rhaiven95: but last season score is always shown, and high score ppl often look at that
[4:32:33] ghantous: @Naguura its the endless crests farm that kills it for me
[4:32:36] serrafin: @Xantoszz I think this season is extremely lenient with the "meta." It's not set in stone like last season and you're seeing several diff comps push high keys. The only class that seems to be a requirement is DH. Be it VDH or Havoc.
[4:32:37] Xantoszz: @andersonmps I mean I sorta get it. Some classes do more damage than others and have utility that makes them more desirable
[4:32:38] Shinzii: i tried like 3 weeks ago to get into retail m+ again with a fresh character. its just ridiculous ppl dont even invite you for fk +5 keys
[4:32:39] BizBichou: @Zirconn__ chat doesnt agree with buying boosts seblehPhone
[4:32:45] highning: but thats the thing, you can just do your own keys till at least 20
[4:32:46] Xastin3: 100% agree
[4:32:47] WwJluxor: "enjoying content" funny meme. most really high keys never get played out seems hell a fun LUL
[4:32:52] kalegeneral: what're your MDI predictions ?
[4:32:56] hlachezarov: yes thats how most ppl without streamer privilage do it :)
[4:32:56] Xastin3: i understand
[4:32:58] foggyfr: if you're starting mid season, and are hoping for 3.4k+ rating. You have the time to grind your own key. No one pushing this high level of key stones are strict on time
[4:32:59] highning: just queue your 18 with 1k score, ppl pile up for weekly
[4:33:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:33:06] Mornex: people are just idiots
[4:33:06] uncontrollable_bladder: Actually, chat, you're also a bit wrong - you need OVERALL score, since people are stupid, and they act as if you're doing all 8 keys. So, it's not enough to have that key timed on -1 and reasonable score.
[4:33:14] Zirconn__: @bizbichou naguuraThinking naguuraThinking naguuraThinking people not be thinking
[4:33:16] Nevariuss: most of the people complaining havent even done a 10
[4:33:19] uncontrollable_bladder: So, it's ilvl, overall score, and then that dungeon done on -1.
[4:33:21] NkKouros: 90% people here get portals and unsub imo. Not surprised by the reaction
[4:33:24] nappingdwarf: gigachad peptalk :D
[4:33:24] nemmyss: i think most understand, they just like to argue xD
[4:33:33] shockxbot: i doing what you said on my alts aswell
[4:33:34] dhezghia: @Naguura i avoid myth track leather gear with avoidance for sale, can you recommend ppl to buy my boes
[4:33:35] theoneginger_ttv: I see where your coming from. and if I didn’t see it, still nbd I’m not that sensitive about opinions
[4:33:39] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura It's a very good, constructive talk. Keep going.
[4:33:40] heykeenan: i hear you naguura! i started late into the expansion and it has been a grind to get to 3k
[4:33:53] highning: my pala hit 70 this week, got all 18s already cause i did my own. ppl just join for weekly, had all +3 or +2
[4:33:53] xygblarbinn: how are you online? servers down
[4:33:53] StreamElements: Maintenance for EU servers isn't today!
[4:33:54] burnthekingx: they just heard the word "boost" and lost their marbles
[4:33:57] heykeenan: it’s tough to get into higher keys as dips
[4:34:02] heykeenan: dps*’
[4:34:13] Zirconn__: wait until they see how many boosts you got on nagony
[4:34:16] uncontrollable_bladder: @theoneginger_ttv But there's no opinions. There's only the truth. Queue up for 2-3h to see for yourself (to anyone that doesn't think this is how it is).
[4:34:23] MelissaVoss: time is money friend
[4:34:28] nappingdwarf: the real question is, do you have the money? :D
[4:34:29] BizBichou: @Zirconn__ and dont even mention the level boost on gary
[4:34:30] Andersonmps: @Zirconn__ And for free
[4:34:31] Xastin3: i tried to make dps alt and pug... its misserable queing for keys. went back to healer next day
[4:34:37] Zirconn__: yeah lmao
[4:34:45] foggyfr: If they want to pay for a boost sure. Just I'm saying, if someone is planning, or hoping to push beyond 3.4k. It stands to reason that they have time for alternatives
[4:34:48] Spikeel: so why dont just place vendors with bis items for money, just to push score
[4:34:51] zinisterzz: people need to learn there time is more valuable than the $14/hour their job tells them they are worth.  If you dont enjoy something and its feassible to outsource it lol
[4:35:02] y0rge: problem is not to get to 24/5 problem is get 26/7/8
[4:35:03] serrafin: @uncontrollable_bladder push your own key or add people you liked playing with after runs. That's how I've done it and I don't wait long between keys
[4:35:06] shaenedh: i think pugging is fine if you are zen, same as what you said earlier about LOL
[4:35:15] NkKouros: Man I have 27-28 S2 and no-one gives a fuck haha
[4:35:23] BizBichou: he's literal rank 5 dps and didnt get in on an alt peepoCryAlot
[4:35:24] HpMuZzY: The big thing that stands out is that what's more valuable to you? Money or time? For most people time is typically more valuable and if you are not going to be set back far then paying for the boost is going to be the ideal method. It's just basic math.
[4:35:27] NkKouros: Main/alt angle. I mean.
[4:35:31] TiPera: not every1 check or know the players thats it
[4:35:31] rhaiven95: he qued as healer and i already had a healer
[4:35:32] uncontrollable_bladder: @serrafin That's the worst advice ever. "Do your own key" should be banned as a phrase. Everywhere. Good people will not apply to your key. You'll get keys you don't need 80% of the time, etc.
[4:35:32] daynerrrrr: people on alts really can suck though n ppl dont wanna take the chance i guess
[4:35:38] CruuuLest: imagine seeing wildi name in queue and not insta inviting KEKW
[4:35:42] bebincalicious: First time I've bought boosts because can't get into any keys, even 18s. Most friends have quit the game, so my only option is buying boosts instead of sitting in queue hoping someone invites me
[4:35:46] theoneginger_ttv: @uncontrollable_bladder I don’t mind waiting in queues and multitasking and having fun waiting with friends and doing multiple different types of content. I personally would boost, that’s my opinion. he opinion is different. doesn’t offend me at all
[4:35:50] voteforpedro064: Im just at the point were i have 2 characters at 2.9k and not really feeling like pushing keys.
[4:35:53] Xastin3: i even put in my notes on my alt... my score and i still got turned down most time.
[4:36:01] darthxaviertv: lol oookay sure naguura
[4:36:07] Zirconn__: we’ve seen you take phone calls and literally do fuck all and not get invited, the streamer privilege argument is dumb as fuck
[4:36:09] TotallyNotRaien: "oh its THAT naguura decline"
[4:36:10] Spikeel: KEKW
[4:36:10] ghantous: lets be real though if u have a 3.8k score or capable of it, your not pugging most of the keys lol
[4:36:11] xxxdabmaster69xxx: i can see your point with saving time with boosts @Naguura  :) makes sense to me
[4:36:12] Emberil: at your key lvl they probably know
[4:36:23] serrafin: @uncontrollable_bladder I never have issues with bad people applying to my keys. You're gatekeeping your keys while simultaneously complaining you never get invited. Make it make sense.
[4:36:23] Emberil: below = no
[4:36:24] braindeadjoseki: people turn down naowh all the time on his rats
[4:36:26] broskeleton: @CruuuLest Maybe they seen that andybrew clip where he threw the necrotic wake by eating the hook on stitchflesh KEKW
[4:36:42] BizBichou: @Xastin3 people don't read the note NOTED reading through 50+ people's notes is just not gonna happen
[4:36:43] REDSUNDERGROUND: @Xastin3 nobody  trust anyone anymore too amny keys burned my dude gun shy  if you will
[4:36:51] lo_lo97: I get it, but people with 410 ilvl have 3k alts queuing for 18’s and up.  like no man.
[4:36:52] sim967: but I know who @naguura is, surely everyone does
[4:36:54] uncontrollable_bladder: @serrafin Sigh. Again, we are discussing the case of actually-good people that came back to the season late. Not the average person.
[4:36:55] dokenr: then dont make mistakes, ez
[4:37:01] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[4:37:05] Zapzoda: “that girl just uses incarn and dies, don’t invite her”
[4:37:13] branzdeadtv: 0.-*+
[4:37:13] Zirconn__: people are just unhappy that they can’t get high score and will find every excuse as to why instead of doing something about it lol
[4:37:15] branzdeadtv: --------------------------
[4:37:22] uncontrollable_bladder: Like, we're discussing people who are good enough to do 27/28s, but just came back to the season late.
[4:37:28] bebincalicious: Remember the BFA pvp clips with pala xdd
[4:37:29] shockxbot: i wouldnt inv you cause i dont want to get back seat gamed by your chat lol
[4:37:30] Xastin3: 3 year ago naguura was prettty rough.... agreed Kappa
[4:37:33] healful1: oh no u died in a video game its the end of the world
[4:37:49] voteforpedro064: @Naguura or the clip you died while broken armor in a Throne of Tides. Clearly a bad player. lol
[4:37:51] serrafin: @uncontrollable_bladder so you check people's IO history. I've had people that have multiple titles that played like crap because they just aren't familiar with the dungeons yet. At the end of the day you are pugging and you are going to have bad groups and good groups. There's no way around bad runs.
[4:37:54] dt_tex: Naguura can come to my keys any time, but she would prob think I am the bad one lol
[4:38:00] shockxbot: na you dont
[4:38:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:38:07] Xantoszz: I don't know how you do so well on balance, I guess I don't do keys that are high enough to actually do damage. Everything seems to die too quickly at the 20-22 range
[4:38:12] highning: nah just cause you the best boomie :-)
[4:38:13] TotallyNotRaien: you have worked very mildly for your score!
[4:38:17] bebincalicious: Streamers have their own WoW shop where they buy score?
[4:38:18] bscheur: I ran a key with one of Jak's alts one time and it was the most stressful run of my life---prob wouldn't join with a streamer again haha
[4:38:18] healful1: there is such a thing as streamer ego/ and such a thing as streamer curse
[4:38:28] Spikeel: just little bit easier
[4:38:54] TotallyNotRaien: is vigil still good?
[4:39:06] serrafin: Yipzz called my friend a bum in a 27 Fall a couple weeks ago and I won't ever let him live it down xD
[4:39:13] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura It absolutely isn't. People are just stupid.
[4:39:17] uncontrollable_bladder: Some*
[4:39:23] mazzooga: Heeey everyone :) cant wait for my new pc to be deliverd next week, so i can play World of Warcraft again!! :)
[4:39:33] Zirconn__: it’s almost like people forget that you pay for a sub and are entitled to do whatever the fuck you want lol
[4:39:40] uncontrollable_bladder: And I do think it's fine to insult people who give no chance to reasonability and objective thought, and I'm ok with catching a ban FeelsOkayMan
[4:39:40] MarkElf2204: @uncontrollable_bladder most* Kappa
[4:39:41] scchizoid: hey nagura, how much versatility do you play with?
[4:39:47] Xastin3: boosting been around since BC.... it hasnt changed
[4:39:53] daynerrrrr: boosting someone that can do higher content isnt boosting ppl need a hobby
[4:40:00] bebincalicious: shifting blame is easier than accepting one's fault
[4:40:00] Nevariuss: its the same people complaining about trader post mounts lol
[4:40:07] dokenr: in CS it's calling the opponent a cheater
[4:40:19] shockxbot: sometimes you can just fail, even good players can fail
[4:40:23] its_bean92: Augs also skewing rating by making keys way easier and having people time keys they would not have if they didnt have an Aug in the group
[4:40:25] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura Boosted runs (+25s and above) are ~2% of the total runs, based on raiderio data. We can assume the real figure is a bit higher, but yea, it's a non-existent issue.
[4:40:28] bebincalicious: @dokenr that's me in every FPS game KEKW "They're hacking"
[4:40:37] OGTweeter: how much do boosts cost? and where do you find them?
[4:40:38] lolguffe: everyone but me sucks ass and if they make a mistake its on purpose
[4:40:54] uncontrollable_bladder: @OGTweeter Too much, and boosting communities. Just DM a random high-end player, and they'll queue up with you for gold.
[4:41:07] bebincalicious: Clip it, guys
[4:41:08] Xastin3: Sadgekin
[4:41:17] Zirconn__: omg streamer so bad everyone look!!!

[4:41:49] mixj1: bear not good
[4:41:53] JustaRandomPlayer01: the no aug experience
[4:42:02] edrelang360: Yo umm gear almost
[4:42:03] Elembry_us: It's always my fault I couldn't heal some one who's clearly standing in shit. That's fun. Or being yelled at because they don't believe in using defensives
[4:42:07] boniley: listen I became a lot happier as a person when I stopped getting mad at WoW keys for going badly
[4:42:14] uncontrollable_bladder: @JustaRandomPlayer01 The "Blizzard gave me free gear and score, so now I'm 3.6k" experience, actually KEKW
[4:42:15] lo_lo97: what’s the add on for their health bars?
[4:42:16] scchizoid: noone use kick lol
[4:42:17] juanlibro: red gear
[4:42:18] edrelang360: Ty for amazing content btw
[4:42:19] Xastin3: only 12 deaths
[4:42:20] AshboneTM: So far so good ResidentSleeper
[4:42:23] goilen: Clearly the problem was that tank didn't pull it into boss
[4:42:24] REDSUNDERGROUND: that chronomeld  is NASTY
[4:42:26] Zirconn__: it’s plater @lo_lo97
[4:42:26] scchizoid: and you're boomie you can cover yourself

[4:42:31] scchizoid: cant*
[4:42:35] adachi_akaso: 13 deaths was it worth
[4:42:43] uncontrollable_bladder: No, it's not.
[4:42:46] Hug_The_Tree: 4 min in. "Anyone has a Jeeves?' lol
[4:42:48] Aegatron: easy
[4:42:49] bebincalicious: 25 deaths and still winnable Kapp
[4:42:49] mixj1: you get it easy still
[4:42:49] Xastin3: fort fall should be doable
[4:42:51] serrafin: Yeah, it is. This key is a joke.
[4:42:53] ppdxd: its pretty easy but the hard part is yet to come after first boss LUL
[4:42:56] Fallen_o7: she is boosted KappaCool

[4:43:16] serrafin: Next platform is where the true trouble awaits though LOL
[4:43:22] Aegatron: LUL
[4:43:26] Xastin3: the sand pile
[4:43:26] Yopmik: xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[4:43:30] bebincalicious: ICANT
[4:43:32] Xastin3: you used it in sand pile
[4:43:35] Aegatron: classic Caro
[4:43:41] Elembry_us: Maybe I've just been lucky with runs. idk, but I find Fall to be the easiest dungeon.
[4:43:42] Zirconn__: bOOstEd bOOMie
[4:43:43] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura Boosted? Weirdge
[4:43:44] flem_wow: just dont exceed key level with deaths
[4:43:56] xapo80: You have red gear :(
[4:44:09] bebincalicious: peepoComfy
[4:44:32] Xastin3: i think you can
[4:44:33] OlaF_oo: easy
[4:44:33] uncontrollable_bladder: No, it's very, very unlikely.
[4:44:37] dvusiv: Yes
[4:44:45] sim967: it’s possible
[4:44:47] healful1: i timed this key with 30 deaths in a 22
[4:44:52] JustaRandomPlayer01: its fall
[4:44:52] shaenedh: this is no isseu to time honestly
[4:44:54] shaenedh: lol
[4:44:58] uncontrollable_bladder: Because people have no respect for their own time, and don't care if they waste 30 mins of their day :)
[4:45:00] JustaRandomPlayer01: you time it with 20 deaths by default
[4:45:05] serrafin: You can still time this place easily as long as next platform isnt a shit show... which it probably will be
[4:45:13] NkKouros: Ezi +2
[4:45:15] mixj1: if you dont lose so much time between 1st and 2nd boss you can
[4:45:18] flipeex: its hard to tell but if you can time any key with a lot of deaths its fallž
[4:45:20] flipeex: fall*
[4:45:25] bebincalicious: PepeLaugh
[4:45:28] JustaRandomPlayer01: If the tank pulls like he did b4 1st boss, the next platform is gonna befun
[4:45:33] bebincalicious: big circle go boom
[4:45:35] shockxbot: timer is giga fine
[4:45:50] voteforpedro064: oh next week is bursting. not a fan of that.
[4:46:03] VennyWise: Is it a weakaura you have which calls out Aura Mastery/Mass Barrier ?
[4:46:06] Elembry_us: No not bursting!!!
[4:46:11] Kuroz: !externals

[4:46:18] flipeex: xDD
[4:46:20] bebincalicious: KEKW
[4:46:25] nappingdwarf: jump the big circle out the map and disengage back in
[4:46:27] Xastin3: bursting tyran shouldnt be too bad
[4:46:29] bebincalicious: Just call for 1-heal
[4:46:33] legjobb: give me love give me love give me looove
[4:46:35] TotallyNotRaien: interesting as in shit design
[4:46:36] Trimbleirl: tell that to the healers
[4:46:46] adachi_akaso: why is that
[4:46:55] arlannotness: 10 of 10 do not recommend pulling that mog with that pack

[4:47:05] Pasonem: But its so much fun to reroll bursting on the last second
[4:47:08] greathasher: no in higher keys is because you have good players lol
[4:47:09] Elembry_us: That makes a lot of sense
[4:47:14] Xantoszz: As long as you don't refresh stacks it's an easy affix
[4:47:28] traindablue: what is that kick tracker addon to the left?
[4:47:33] uncontrollable_bladder: It's safe to leave the key now!
[4:47:34] Elembry_us: I'm running consistent 20s and bursting is rough bc everything dies so fast.
[4:47:34] Zoraija22: healer main playing max. 23s can confirm - it's hell
[4:47:38] Luk777ls: is this  bear or a boomkin stream
[4:47:39] Xastin3: i love when dps refresh bursting  to 15 stacks
[4:47:43] imvots: can you explain how to ramp up faster on packs with balance druid?
[4:47:44] Xastin3: dispell myself and let them die
[4:47:46] Luk777ls: how often you are in bear form
[4:47:51] NkKouros: Also people forget bursting caps at 15, which means in a 25 you've out-geared the damage it does

[4:50:02] destrochain: what is this weakaura on top for casts?
[4:50:08] Kuroz: not a wa
[4:50:16] Kuroz: just a target cast bar from quartz
[4:50:23] Xantoszz: For balance do you need to pool astral power towards the end of pulls to do better damage on the next pack?
[4:50:33] forcetriangle: where do high keys begin this seaspn
[4:50:33] Xastin3: true
[4:50:37] LoLOkanak: i mean your not wrong
[4:50:38] sim967: it’s a 5 people check
[4:50:45] shaenedh: timer is super fine btw
[4:50:48] Xastin3: cordination check

[4:54:23] Xastin3: us is offline
[4:54:32] Elembry_us: It's reset day for NA servers
[4:54:40] uncontrollable_bladder: ONLY OVERALL MATTERS Madge
[4:55:01] Xantoszz: I just struggle with ramping damage out quickly
[4:55:09] Xastin3: thats not triple dragon Kappa
[4:55:11] uncontrollable_bladder: We didn't time the key, but at least I look good on overall!
[4:55:37] dvusiv: spot the ret player
[4:55:48] uncontrollable_bladder: @dvusiv KEKW
[4:56:08] zebra1gameing: <3
[4:56:17] Elembry_us: How does everyone feel about the ret buff?
[4:56:32] chamtonajsl: @elembryus so wierd boosting something thats already performing well
[4:57:01] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[4:57:10] Elembry_us: @chamtonajsl Agreed. I kinda felt like it was already bordering on broken. Curious what the reason was for buffing Ret.
[4:57:14] ChokingVictimSMT: Metzen paid them under the table for ret buffs, only logical reason
[4:57:19] dubz8888: naguura what games do you play offline in your spare time?
[4:57:29] Mornex: @chat do you guys think Alchemy is the preferred profession if you focus on m+?
[4:58:00] serrafin: @Mornex engi
[4:58:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:58:14] Elembry_us: @Mornex It's certainly good for pots. I focus inscriptions and alchemy to craft runes, pots and phials for my guild.
[4:58:27] dvusiv: p2 damage output is insane
[4:58:27] Lara_TV_: It lasts longer in each subsequent phase
[4:58:29] Yttrius: P1 isn't dangerous
[4:58:29] chorsh: the aoe dmg output p2 i assume
[4:58:30] dvusiv: I think is the only reason
[4:58:31] RageonaAnetheron: more dangerous in later phases
[4:58:32] nappingdwarf: phases just harder?
[4:58:33] rhaiven95: you get necrotic wake in p2
[4:58:35] uncontrollable_bladder: The danger
[4:58:43] itsClubby: love tft naguuraFest
[4:58:44] uncontrollable_bladder: Yoda spoke about it
[4:58:47] AshboneTM: Corruption is the same. Just no other incoming dmg in P1 so it's less risky. I suppose
[4:58:48] Lara_TV_: p2 is more overall dmg, but p3 is even longer
[4:58:54] rhaiven95: and on p1 you can insta give it to tank, on p2 you cant cause it lasts longer
[4:58:54] Lara_TV_: Longer duration before reclamation
[4:58:54] startlord92: you clear it in 5 secs in p1
[4:58:56] Lara_TV_: Is the main reason
[4:59:00] LoLOkanak: if your talking about the balls, its prob bec of the timeing that hasto be done to clear it with tank and winds
[4:59:01] Yttrius: The tornado phase + the corrupt debuff chunks you
[4:59:02] Andersonmps: @elembryus Didint see them. What was buffed
[4:59:04] shaenedh: in P1 the clear comes 5s after the debuff gets applied
[4:59:06] dubz8888: theres simultaneous damage with the ball
[4:59:07] Yttrius: so it's safer to not have the extra dmg
[4:59:07] shaenedh: in P2 and P3 way later
[4:59:07] Elembry_us: if you don't play hot potato with the corruptions the damage isn't that bad
[4:59:07] TiPera: you should know the mechanics u are a streamer Kappa
[4:59:07] dvusiv: winds + corruption is a bit much
[4:59:10] ghenesis_: p2  you have the winds which is huge aoe dmg, third phase u have constant dmg from of the drake randomly shooting at a party member
[4:59:13] voteforpedro064: p2 has more movement and dmg output so p2 is hardest
[4:59:19] shockxbot: exactly
[4:59:21] uncontrollable_bladder: Yep
[4:59:22] RageonaAnetheron: the timings on the tank frontal to clear it takes longer to go out
[4:59:28] shaenedh: its only about the time between application and removal of the debuff
[4:59:29] JohnAllenCasts: you need to pass corruption later in p2 since the removal comes after the timer is the only thing I know about it
[4:59:31] iiiTzApollo: im going to be picking up boomie again im tired of playing dh :(
[4:59:35] Andersonmps: Other phases are more chaotic
[4:59:41] shaenedh: in P1 its like 5s of debuff, you juggle once, in P2 you juggle twice and in P3 you juggle several times
[4:59:45] RageonaAnetheron: so more damage just happens if you don’t meld it in 2 and 3
[4:59:51] Elembry_us: @Andersonmps I'd need to go back and look at the patch notes, but 10-20% buffs if I remember correctly.
[5:00:03] anthaxel: P2 you have to pass orb at least once
[5:00:54] Elembry_us: We hold for 10 seconds and then pass to the tank. Shadowmeld p3 of the fight if it targets a Nelf
[5:00:54] adachi_akaso: someone said 29 deaths and here we are
[5:01:05] Andersonmps: Lucky
[5:01:19] Xastin3: they just know who squishiest member of party hapeens to be
[5:01:31] GoodNewsforyoo: Hey helloo how's it going
[5:01:37] MarkElf2204: mage holding lust for his combust kek
[5:01:57] Xastin3: more like mage holding lust for next boss
[5:02:12] Hofman007: Are your glasses now only for show?
[5:02:13] Elembry_us: Mage can essentially double lust themself so that + combustion means busted
[5:02:17] iiiTzApollo: seeing no aug is giving me hope that we just dont need them to progress
[5:02:17] uncontrollable_bladder: Mental recovered? PogU
[5:02:18] Kuroz: !glasses

[5:31:41] LtJenkins: @forcetriangle Yuck. Unless they do something to azure vaults, that dungeon is going to be pain since the broke all the skips
[5:31:45] Yttrius: branch is dj-bait imo
[5:32:03] AbieCherry: Branch + mirror.
[5:32:11] AbieCherry: you line up branch for pulsar
[5:32:14] sim967: is it confirmed s4

[6:18:30] BobbyLightweight: @pistolerox99 run your own key
[6:18:39] LtJenkins: @pistolerox99 It's not the advice anyone wants to hear, but run your own key. Many times you will get absolutely carried through low keys because people are gearing alts and stuff
[6:19:12] gottkeks: @LtJenkins push your own keys

[6:19:41] skeeld: running your own key is bis
[6:19:42] deathstriker99: they give u a key when u ask for u missing a key done
[6:19:43] Kuroz: @muirne_ it's sub only
[6:20:11] pistolerox99: Ok thank you
[6:20:18] LtJenkins: I think that person doesn't give you one if you've literally never done a key in the season.
[6:20:28] deathstriker99: they still do ltjenkins
[6:20:33] niobid: @LtJenkins correct
[6:20:57] deathstriker99: i havent done one last season and i was able to talk to the npc
[6:21:20] LtJenkins: It might be by account
[6:21:32] LtJenkins: We had a guildie and we thought he was crazy that person didn't have the dialogue option
[6:21:41] deathstriker99: hmm kk
[6:22:09] xhawrill: where can i seee nagura's build ?
[6:22:16] deathstriker99: well then, maybe ask ones guild to go through a m0 of maybe...... brackenhide

[6:23:39] xitsxzero: how do you buy a boost?
[6:23:40] uncontrollable_bladder: I suggest doing a higher key, IF you have friends to invite you. You'd get a higher key that way.
[6:23:40] jazp_21: CAn you not just talk to the panda outside vault room?
[6:23:47] Numtrers: you can just get a 2 from the panda yeah
[6:23:53] jazp_21: Yup
[6:23:58] deathstriker99: lots of lw etc need a lockout of brackenhide for specific armor crafts, for it has the altar of decay in it at the end
[6:24:04] uncontrollable_bladder: I see, sorry.
[6:24:08] jazp_21: Doesnt matter :D
[6:24:08] Numtrers: doesnt matter, you can do it as u ding
[6:24:13] burncrus_dkw: you dont have to do one, you will always get a key

[6:24:54] LtJenkins: @jazp_21 I said above the restriction might be account bound. Like if you've done a key on a different toon in the season, then your alts can grab the free key
[6:25:18] jazp_21: aaaah that might be true actually

[6:26:01] jazp_21: If you've done a key or not the whole expac
[6:26:06] LtJenkins: The guildie might have been trolling us, but he claimed he couldn't get the free key. Had played since SL and was coming back season 2 DF or something so we were going to help him gear and told him to grab the free one. @jazp_21
[6:26:09] Zoraija22: nsync were the 90's tho
[6:26:18] LtJenkins: hadn't*
[6:26:24] Xantoszz: I recommend doing 0s before trying to pug keys. You want to have some idea of what you're doing
[6:26:32] jazp_21: Yea I mean it sounds legit. :D
[6:26:45] uncontrollable_bladder: @Google ?
[6:26:46] LtJenkins: @Xantoszz 2s are basically 0s. And you can't do 0s of the current season anyway

[7:30:57] glesgagaming: being a good team mate, solaring things, typhooning etc is just as important @fluffybearms
[7:31:06] NeccoTL: it's weird how EU is actually in the future yet their weekly reset is behind US
[7:31:21] astreinoid: aoe burst against aoe sustain on low key... be lucky to be above good tank ;)
[7:31:45] fluffybearms: @glesgagaming i just dont know if its class issue or me. Sure i focus on CC, typhons, but idk, i feel all do soo much damage so fast.
[7:32:05] fluffybearms: Before i set all dots, half pack is dead
[7:32:27] NeccoTL: :'(
[7:32:28] LtJenkins: @fluffybearms Unfortunate reality of boomkin in lower keys

[7:33:33] astreinoid: you shine with bad team mates though
[7:33:34] Andersonmps: Thats true
[7:34:01] Andersonmps: Boomkins take too long to ramp. This is a issue
[7:34:35] adrestias_revolt: what horde race should i choose for druid
[7:34:49] Natalie_8272: I dont think ive ever uttered those words 'i want to do atal'
[7:35:21] Jack_the_Dipper: Because you need to build up right?
[7:35:22] recklesskorxd: fort feels better
[7:35:31] Leredi: if key too low for your dps, its bad class design, because most players do low keys
[7:35:37] Drusty92: Its like shadow priests  .... (crying in the shower)
[7:35:42] glesgagaming: Flexuura
[7:35:59] reggiepowa: @Leredi I agree

[7:36:18] maybejacobmetz: clip it and ship it

[7:37:02] JevyJ: If all classes did good damage in low keys then they would all be bursty af and youd have the same different damage profiles
[7:37:05] annettebrr: i think its okay that certain classes perform well  in different scenarios
[7:37:14] reggiepowa: it should be balanced around 20 keys where rewards end, if something is unbalanced at 30s that's whatever
[7:37:15] Natalie_8272: I've noticed taking fury of elune and belor trinket definitely helps in lower keys
[7:37:22] Natalie_8272: cause burst
[7:37:29] vandroy88: naguura how do u feel playing boomie on tindral and fyrakk mythic? I feel we are by far the worst spec for that fight... its so frustrating
[7:37:36] Wulf92: @Naguura heya, do you know when does MDI stream  starts ?

[7:39:45] reggiepowa: they should be balanced around content that drops the highest rewards so mythic raid and 20 keys, cant balance around infinitely scalable system
[7:39:47] arlannotness: Hmm but that is most players live at should that not be the most balanced part of the game?
[7:39:47] Wupday: considering the game is 20yos and balancing in general is horrendous, the whole thing is a joke
[7:40:17] yiannisjk: can every class win title? I've never gotten title but never played meta spec, this season I've been on prot/ret pally and I went to 3.6k without realising
[7:40:26] astreinoid: damage profile representation and difference could be balanced more
[7:40:38] Jack_the_Dipper: When is it a lower key?  <16, <20?
[7:40:42] glesgagaming: I'd rather take a skilled player on any class, than a poorer player player on a "meta" class
[7:41:02] Jack_the_Dipper: Damn some nice oldskool hits in this playlist
[7:41:10] webwiss: It is matter in my opinion for all class to get into low level key or  even normal dungeon and not see that game is completely broken and tanks are almost running everything in solo and the rest are just watching. This makes new gamers feeling like they are useless and game is not interesting at all

[7:43:29] margothon: are you talking about a casual player though, or is that a wannabee good player?
[7:43:43] arlannotness: Yes we agree on that, I also agree that is a really dumb thing the community does.
[7:43:52] hot_souffle: I agree with that statement. I concur
[7:43:54] Andersonmps: Once the meta is decided, the lvl of the key dont matter
[7:43:58] Jack_the_Dipper: @uncontrollable_bladder Im not sure about the streaming part, but they maybe do less research I guess
[7:43:59] bizzenwow: but boomie is finally meta and you're not pushing. What's up
[7:44:03] savagelo256: I can’t figure out your accent where are you from
[7:44:06] uncontrollable_bladder: Yes, of course, but there's a distinction between the 90%++ people who do <20s, and people who do >20s.
[7:44:16] hot_souffle: As a boomie, I concur
[7:44:19] RaidbullTv: wait... is balance druid back?

[7:46:00] Jack_the_Dipper: naguuraEZ
[7:46:03] allknownmaster: why would they care it is mage or feral XD
[7:46:06] Boogley87: @LtJenkins hah
[7:46:18] Freddyfx36: bro low keys people dont even play their class properly
[7:46:19] nox_hull: Wut, higher ilvl obv gets in :D
[7:46:32] dogcamon: 90% of people do not play higher keys than at maximum 15
[7:46:35] arlannotness: The information is out there but people do not look for it and use it
[7:46:47] sigma_hk: low key doesnt need any balancing, item level matters way more then class balance
[7:46:49] stig99: whats a surivval hunter
[7:46:53] stig99: is that a hunter that uses defensives
[7:46:59] margothon: wghat is the definition you are using for a "casual player"?
[7:46:59] arlannotness: sadly yes

[7:47:16] arlannotness: correct
[7:47:29] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura You are right, but again - it's only ~10% of people who even do keys above and 20.
[7:47:50] Boogley87: but what would the information be used for? that he's good on 15's but not any higher?
[7:47:53] Eivy1987: dps comp by keylevel
[7:47:54] Boogley87: if the idea is to push I mean
[7:47:58] Jack_the_Dipper: Police just came by my door asking to turn of the search lights kaatTehe

[7:48:13] vandroy88: for lower keys usually high burst classes are better and on high keys that's hardly the case
[7:48:19] margothon: perhaps you ae seeing this from the point of a non casual player
[7:48:35] allknownmaster: in 15 key you see agi feral in party, you wait 15mins for healer and then say bro go heal  and feral ive never done it and all party is it would be fine just try :)))
[7:48:41] Andersonmps: @uncontrollable_bladder Whats she saying is that this 10% are who determines the entire meta. And thats true
[7:48:53] uncontrollable_bladder: @uncontrollable_bladder Correct. The meta ripples even to 20s.
[7:48:58] Boogley87: yes
[7:48:59] uncontrollable_bladder: Sorry, doing weeklies on EU pepeW
[7:49:15] arlannotness: arlannotness subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:49:15] uncontrollable_bladder: @Naguura No, sorry, I wasn't paying full attention.
[7:49:16] LtJenkins: @Boogley87 Most people don't want to push. Most just want their 18 vaults or portals. But the community feels like they need a meta comp in something like a 15 so the miss out on a lot of people who probably would be better because people are blinded by the comps doing 30s
[7:49:20] uncontrollable_bladder: mb
[7:49:21] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[7:49:26] skullreaper1311: !drops
[7:49:34] stig99: for 99,9% of the player base meta dont matter. just play what you enjoy
[7:49:50] Freddyfx36: but why do low keys matter in data they are often undergeared and don't play their class optimally anyway
[7:49:51] margothon: exactly stig
[7:49:52] Drusty92: In addition to the rogue argument, while that is true, there will be a good amount of people spreading the "meta" for certain dungeons requiring a rogue, i.e. Darkheart Skip for Bears. Not knowing that there are invis potions because those rarely get mentioned in any info/guides.
[7:49:56] Andersonmps: @stig99 That number is way too high
[7:50:27] Moonyfangs: new videos?
[7:50:30] dogcamon: it shouldnt tho thats what he means i think
[7:50:32] astreinoid: people doing high m+ also do low keys... those are the people pushing you out of grps mostly, spec performance equal will not change this
[7:50:34] Boogley87: @LtJenkins I guess I haven't really run into that issue because I play with my guildmates so even when my main wasn't meta, I could easily get a spot. I guess there's another community aspect to look at there?
[7:50:49] margothon: i think a casual player doesnt think about an of this, perhaps there are 3 types of mythic plus player,
[7:50:56] Interactiveheart: !drop
[7:50:57] Moonyfangs: what percentage of people do keys about 15?
[7:51:09] Interactiveheart: !drops
[7:51:19] Kuroz: drops ended 35 minutes ago
[7:51:25] prudii_ramikad: its relevancy. What classes perform better in certain situations? If the classes were built to perform their best in 15 keys, higher tier players would be bored. The higher key players may only be 10% of the population, but they also put far more hours into running keys.
[7:51:28] dogcamon: its not never its always thats the problem
[7:51:37] arlannotness: I think of it from a corporate perspective, Blizzard will balance around what generates the most revenue and that is not people running high keys ie over +25.
[7:51:39] LtJenkins: @Boogley87 Yes this disucssion is really only relevant to pugging
[7:51:46] uncontrollable_bladder: Yes, it impacts way more than the 10% doing those 20s.
[7:51:52] Interactiveheart: @Kuroz I needed 2 more % shit
[7:52:09] uncontrollable_bladder: I highly doubt that's more than a few people.
[7:52:12] Miklagart: cmon everybody looks up class guides, m+ strats which are all made by high level players
[7:52:15] hackiii: omg why do i not do 300k dps in a +12 key Sadge
[7:52:19] uncontrollable_bladder: You're right, but I don't think that's a meaningful number.
[7:52:47] fennrirq: @Naguura watching grey naguura screen motivcates me notto play moonkin LUL
[7:52:49] Andersonmps: Just look ate the class population. In shadowlands warlock was the highest. Now is Demon Hunter
[7:53:01] margothon: but you are saying casual player, casual meaning not competative?
[7:53:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[7:53:06] arlannotness: Speaking of competitive gaming are you doing MDI?
[7:53:08] uncontrollable_bladder: Yes, there is an uptick of activity in M+/raids after the RWF/MDI, etc., but I never saw it being meaningful and/or it's hard to measure, since live keys might be on shitty affixes.
[7:53:37] dogcamon: most people do it for rewards
[7:53:41] uncontrollable_bladder: Ok, I'll type if you read it FeelsOkayMan
[7:54:06] Boogley87: I understand that some people (a lot) only do the 18's or 20's for their vault and then log, but that's not the competitive aspect of M+ and that's why it isn't geared towards those players. I can see how that would be frustrating but the point is to push and it's geared towards those people.
[7:54:14] Elanell: hi Caro, what camera do you have?
[7:54:17] nebulaa13: In the end score is also a form of reward
[7:54:22] Kuroz: !cam
[7:54:22] StreamElements: Sony Alpha 7 mark III with a Tamron 17-28 mm lens .    2nd cam : Elgato Facecam full HD - Sony Alpha 6300 until I fix the main cam
[7:55:29] Drusty92: While i know you´re not a pvper but that argument could be applied to back in the day when they introcued rated pvp.
[7:56:09] margothon: i would define a casual player as this. They do as many M+ as they need to do to get the best gear they can get from the vault and then they dont do any more m plus
[7:56:09] Andersonmps: M+ was what trully saved wow
[7:56:10] glesgagaming: m+ basicallysaved wow and gave it a whole new lease of life
[7:56:30] angrykhoifish: if M+ wasn't competitive.... folks wouldn't stay. It'll be like D3 where folks play for 1 week, get to whatever point they feel good at, and then quit for the season
[7:56:40] Boogley87: @angrykhoifish this
[7:56:57] BlackHijinks: Seeing how high i can go is definitely a motivating factor. I'm lucky i main Lock so I'm always meta. I love how competitive it is

[7:57:16] zinisterzz: @uncontrollable _bladder by that logic no games viewership should have gone down in the same time?
[7:57:59] snowfloofy: Twitch is dead for FF when the new expansion drops too because people don't want spoilers. I think FF gets viewers when ultimate/savage comes around mostly
[7:58:01] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[7:58:06] angrykhoifish: Also the story content for FF14 is extremely niche. A lot of players don't want to deal with it
[7:58:15] Paleee_: @Naguura final prediction for 10.2.6?
[7:58:48] fennrirq: @Naguura btw I think M+ is super good thing but it eventually killed PVP Kappa

[7:59:24] Andersonmps: @Jack_the_Dipper Already came out just now. Is via Prime Gaming
[7:59:42] Jack_the_Dipper: @Andersonmps aaah ty for letting me know
[7:59:43] angrykhoifish: for pvp to exist, they need to separate the tuning and balancing between PVE and PVP. They've done it a little, but not to the extent it needs. Also they could easily do like a "do 3 battlegrounds get a free random mount" event but they don't
[8:00:06] yohobojoe_ssbm: what ilevel should I be for like +16 keys or heroic amir?

[8:00:37] fennrirq: @Naguura I think it's a big Blizzard mistale to maintain old classic wow for couple nostalgic old people, they just have no capacity to compete with new riot mmo i think
[8:00:37] nebulaa13: Bye Naguura, bye chat!
[8:00:42] CoffeeDeus: @angrykhoifish I mean they tried templates in Legion and received quite a bit of backlash. IMO it'd be worth trying again, but fftbgShrug
[8:00:44] Boogley87: baibai
[8:00:49] Andersonmps: Ahhh. But is a such a good talk... Sadge
[8:00:53] badactionhiro: Ski drinking guides...
[8:00:56] glesgagaming: PVP was always the esport that kept wow interesting outside of playing the main game, RWF and M+ has far exceeded that and given wow a whole new aspect
