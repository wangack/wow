[0:45:41] maddy02_: i think you need to use your zen pulse more often on tank with EM on it, it does 3x the damage for me in a dung @yumytv
[0:45:44] Meteox: Thank you sir!

[0:47:16] maddy02_: @Mortenzlol ya u dont really need tf at the start of a pull f.e.
[0:47:23] Mortenzlol: Zen pulse isn't target capped is it?
[0:47:29] maddy02_: and then, when you use chi ji on 3 stacks your em is also perma instant @Mortenzlol
[0:47:37] maddy02_: @Mortenzlol no
[0:47:59] Dizi_Kash: what dungeon wa are you using ?
[0:48:00] maddy02_: so i find myself barely EVER hardcasting EM @Mortenzlol

[0:48:43] hunterzx: i prefer the natty zen pulse than the 2nd talent one
[0:48:55] maddy02_: tthe more targets it hits the more it heals so i always nearly use it on tank with EM
[0:48:56] reppap: i have a target of target macro for zen pulse and just press on whatever im hitting 4Head

[2:21:17] nightbreeze93: what a lie
[2:21:21] rekittvgg: npc
[2:21:43] shilarin: there have been so many MC's that shave minutes off keys though
[2:21:45] baseboned: what intereaction? SNIFFA
[2:21:54] shilarin: workshop squirrels, spires bonecleavers, etc.
[2:22:14] sadufika: is diffuse or yulon better in 28 rise?
[2:22:21] baseboned: but what's the current one Im asking
[2:22:50] baseboned: I want to know what to mc
[2:22:53] shilarin: Stinger's in everbloom
[2:23:01] baseboned: wut
[2:23:13] shilarin: the wasps
[2:23:20] shilarin: all around the first area
[2:23:30] baseboned: I thought you could only MC humanoids wtf?
[2:23:33] yctnm: the stingers are humanoids? HMM
[2:23:36] Emm_Zee: You know what's the tech? MC the spiderling in brh with its infinite stacking dot HOLY
[2:23:47] hunterzx: i feel like its some higherup deciding if its cringe or appears exploitative to people that have never played the game... and not people that actually play the game
[2:24:18] shilarin: imo the stinger is far from the worst mindcontrol we've had in m+
[2:24:21] nightbreeze93: where is my everbloom prison gameplay RAGEY
[2:24:32] shilarin: its probably the one that took the longest to find, so it *feels* exploitative
[2:24:32] baseboned: oh lol, it only says NOT mechanical, undead, or demons
[2:24:36] rekittvgg: YES
[2:24:42] rekittvgg: WHATS UP WIT HTHAT BTW
[2:24:45] baseboned: it's mins soothe that's humonoid and dragon only
[2:24:52] smBarrel: Ridiculous as in how?
[2:25:02] IAmSolari: what are they doing?
[2:25:06] Emm_Zee: Bugfix timeways stacking within days of it being revealed, but the doubletick remains in the game forever xdd
[2:25:24] baseboned: lol
[2:25:24] rekittvgg: jack shit is what they're doing. there are so many obvious changes that needs to happen it's just... not
[2:25:50] ClipCraft: did they fix the everbloom priest tech yet?
[2:25:57] smBarrel: No
[2:25:59] baseboned: my guild jokes that only one person is still working on Dragonflight, he's named steve and he's doing his best
[2:26:16] UsedRuggs: like the leap safe spot in WCM
[2:26:24] hunterzx: poor steve
[2:26:52] CMTerp: which boss?
[2:26:54] AryeeMeow: I am Mistweaver - Health Bar Healing, Fort Key Slamming.
[2:27:03] Rottee: healers aren't people so blizz don't care
[2:27:04] hunterzx: i've seen so many wipes in +20 range from double tick - other person dies, 3+ ticks on the group
[2:27:06] CMTerp: yea its a nightmare
[2:27:09] kakebuts: it is. usually it's just the tank killing the last 10% on low keys
[2:27:14] CMTerp: people die all the time
[2:27:15] shilarin: in weekly 20's you just kinda live it while moving if you're geared
[2:27:20] baseboned: wut
[2:27:26] baseboned: avoidance doesn't work?
[2:27:38] IAmSolari: is it time for healers to rise up?
[2:27:40] baseboned: where's that patch note
[2:28:36] baseboned: OH the "addressed an issue where chronofaded wasn't considered aoe" thing
[2:28:42] baseboned: I didn't realize what that meant
[2:28:43] baseboned: lmao
[2:28:48] miketrouts: a mage with no stops Pog
[2:28:51] miketrouts: we love mage players
[2:28:53] Caysadia: Flow of thyme
[2:28:56] rekittvgg: the only logic answer to lack of changes this season i can think of, is they're massively shifting things internally after microsoft bought blizzard, so maybe they can't put as many rescources into balancing dungeons etc
[2:28:58] rekittvgg: i dunno
[2:29:17] zamow1994: they are just doing the next expansion
[2:29:55] miketrouts: ofc he is moving the mobs the the edge
[2:30:02] miketrouts: classic shadow priest players

[2:40:23] IAttackYou: timbermaw would have done it without lust
[2:40:40] zachl_: timber plays aug and poe now
[2:40:47] zachl_: that guys a fake healer
[2:40:48] K4lsdern: dorki heals 4 dragons without lust

[2:41:00] lord_konstantine: K4lsdern GIGACHAD

[2:45:47] zolal3: @forsaken130 20-24 is flip dungs
[2:45:52] forsaken130: Just started 25s and it feels a lot easier lol
[2:46:06] Emm_Zee: I feel like 22/23s are kinda still okay if you are a blaster dps
[2:46:41] KaladinHS: nobody applies to my 22s
[2:46:42] zolal3: can you blast yazma too with a stupid tank?
[2:46:59] Emm_Zee: @zolal3 No but I can verbally blast the tank xdd
[2:47:04] forsaken130: @zolal3 xdd
[2:47:06] hunterzx: nah up to 23, maybe 24 is pain because people can still live while posessing 0 iq, by being carried by healer
[2:47:12] IAmSolari: nah 20s are fucking cursed
[2:47:38] IAmSolari: would take a 22 over a 20 any day
[2:47:44] lord_konstantine: @hunterzx its so funny when in 23s the healer is like their mom "ok guys, for thext pull remember to press personals :) "
[2:47:54] Emm_Zee: Deffo gotta be one of the pug-approved classes if you wanna "carry" lower 20s tho
[2:48:07] hunterzx: tthat was me in a +26. they didn't, we got 7 deaths in dragon pull in rise. depleted by 20s

[4:14:39] mawji_: had that happen in a 25 last night and died for nothing of my own fault, just dispelled myself in light and fell over :)
[4:14:39] Mattie43: fun detected
[4:14:44] KDaily: on death affixes from 1 forces mobs
[4:14:46] hunterzx: aggro issues in WM, also bug on triad where the "move" debuff doesn't disappear, etc. those bugs are fine to leave in. but lets stop the one thing that helps players

[4:15:03] baseboned: Steve
[4:15:07] mythmaster1337: we got one guyed
[4:15:09] instabrickkeyassassin: they won't cap keys at 20
[4:15:24] mawji_: the janitor is doing his best guys dont flame him too hard
[4:15:32] instabrickkeyassassin: they might nerf key scaling to make 20s trivial so very casual players reach max gear
[4:16:07] nerefwow: like a Fleshcrafter from NW
[4:16:23] raechu_: I've worked in that kind of bug fixing tech support before. They will have a priority system for what to fix, and "exploits" will be higher than stuff that makes the game less fun. All exploits will be high priority with no nuance so a m+ boss tech is the same prio as a gold dupe exploit
[4:16:24] nerefwow: interrupts the cast, was useful tech
[4:17:05] raechu_: im not saying this is good for the record
[4:17:10] nezo_pont: do you think mdi will be mostly caster based comps again? AAAA
[4:17:26] Klon_____: maybe its a boss/manager decision they see it as more egregious
[4:17:28] whiskeyhide: mage
[4:17:30] nerefwow: mage
[4:17:31] hunterzx: how about bosses exploiting and cheating to kill players, and depleting our keys?
[4:17:43] baseboned: wizards
[4:17:53] haelthyr: The solution is to rebuff god comp, ez fix
[4:17:58] khebul: what is in chat's opinion is more fun: key level limited by damage output or oneshots (damage taken)?
[4:18:07] nerefwow: @hunterzx so that explains my tanks dying to bosses on 23 fort
[4:18:15] anaya909: so what does vengeance just carry kicks that hard in mdi this season
[4:18:25] anaya909: to have 3 casters i mean
[4:18:30] hunterzx: @khebul oneshots are not as fun as having to min-max dps and pulls to time keys, imo
[4:18:30] haelthyr: @anaya909 Yes
[4:18:35] raechu_: @khebul damage output 100% but it runs into a problem where healers don't have a way to contribute to it
[4:18:55] whiskeyhide: i like "stops scaling after 25" or something like that
[4:19:07] EmElw: all damage scaling over a 25 becomes staggered damage
[4:19:09] K4lsdern: ideally every element of the dungeon scales at the same pace but that's like impossible Shruge
[4:19:12] instabrickkeyassassin: is anybody happy about the general direction of healers?
[4:19:13] nerefwow: It‚Äôs always going to get to that point though if damage is scaling.
[4:19:14] EmElw: would be giga weird
[4:19:20] Asuriuz: after 20 dmg scaling is per level is halved, while hp scaling remains the same Shruge
[4:19:44] ClownzDE: this key depletion thing is cringe af. there¬¥s literally no upside to it
[4:19:47] khebul: What about log scaling for damage taken, linear scaling for mob's HP?
[4:19:51] nerefwow: Yeah you should just be able to attempt one key level higher than you‚Äôve done as much as you want.
[4:20:02] haelthyr: Id rather them increase the scaling on mob health and stall the dmg output
[4:20:05] raechu_: I like the idea of being able to bump your key up to the highest level of that dungeon you've timed
[4:20:11] ManoMorp: I wish you could try the key e.g. 3 times before it actually depletes.
[4:20:16] PrimerinoTV: punishment is you wasted 30 mins of your time not timing the key
[4:20:18] preyxdd: @raechu_ season would be over in like 4 weeks
[4:20:24] baseboned: the titanforge podcast discussed this, they suggested keys having 2-3 charges before depleting instead of 1
[4:20:24] nerefwow: that‚Äôs an execution thing though.
[4:20:29] yctnm: The value in grouping with a random player is the value of scarce, specific keys
[4:20:38] Mattie43: keys should be "cracked" and only have 2 uses total.
[4:20:43] nezo_pont: i think its fairly easy to get a pug for your group as a dps, but its impossible to join, like people want you to be like 460+ for 10 keys xdd
[4:20:53] hunterzx: what about: key depleted? doesn't go down a level, but you can't put it in for X-timer. gotta go do something else
[4:20:53] nerefwow: your key going down and having to re-roll 6 keys to get the dungeon you want makes any sense
[4:21:04] SniperBaitx: rather than making the damage get to the point it one shots what about another tier of affixes that happen at 20+. of course that brings the topic of "good affixes" and all that
[4:21:05] raechu_: Yeah something that would be great for pugs is being able to go again with the same group rather than sitting in LFG for another 30 minutes
[4:21:30] Xastin3: they need rebalance damage and healer so that its less 1 shots. more sustained.
[4:21:55] glynbach: Maybe you could earn tokens for successful runs that allow you to negate a depletion for e.g 4 tokens
[4:22:11] raechu_: @SniperBaitx Affixes that start in higher keys actually suck for people learning the game. I'm teaching my partner m+ atm and we just got to 14s and 15s and she's getting owned by spiteful because she never got to do it in lower keys where it won't 2 shot her
[4:22:31] instabrickkeyassassin: you can make damage less spiky but they did that at the start of DF and people complained
[4:22:41] cochiko: Maybe remove depletion, but you're locked out of that specific dungeon for a set time; can work on another key, but not endlessly retry YOLO strats
[4:22:43] amyra: Found it useful to be able to lower key level and reroll my key. Even more helpful when paired with someone else then you can farm certain items/slots.
[4:23:09] spotteddoggo: holy shit why is every1 typing paragraphs
[4:23:13] spotteddoggo: yall are old lmao
[4:23:31] raechu_: @instabrickkeyassassin when did people complain? If you're talking about RLP that wasn't complaining about rot damage that was complaining that the it was just the top of a damage spike but for the entire final 2 thirds of the dungeon
[4:23:39] instabrickkeyassassin: the 25% health pool increases
[4:23:43] instabrickkeyassassin: that's what it is
[4:24:09] SupahStrider: Is MW a good first time healer to learn? I've only played melee classes
