[1:19:52] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[1:19:55] falldrgn: was it a short sell? Like she wanted to get out?
[1:20:06] Bulgogiprince: Smashing the walls is the fun part
[1:20:08] CritcobainTV: I'd LOVE doing the demolition part of remodeling. Y'all MF's can fix it, i'll destroy it
[1:20:10] antori_92: antori1992 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 75 months! 
[1:20:10] Bulgogiprince: just cleaning it up sucks
[1:20:26] kalmenus1: The landlord made their money renting it out, so basically what she’s selling it for is profit
[1:20:38] h_u_r_k_: just watch bob vila LUL
[1:21:19] Zigra1: shit i would add a mini-split a/c unit in the upgraded streaming room
[1:21:24] Crazdmadman: get rid of a paperwork headache for her
[1:21:28] CDubTheRIPper: she probably took that into factor when giving you that price LUL
[1:21:31] Amarlian: It sounds like she got something out of the good deal too then
[1:21:37] RushWarr: and that's the thing, if you've had awesome renters, why screw them, sell the house for possibly what you owe or slightly above
[1:21:41] dozilla: yeah, she probably gave you a discount as well of what the Realtors would have made
[1:22:21] RushWarr: they've been paying the mortgage, and in the military we get a housing allowance, its not coming out of our pocket theoretically
[1:23:05] CritcobainTV: LUL
[1:23:06] cowee12356995: LUL
[1:23:07] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[1:23:15] SavageCheez: Make it happen
[1:23:15] RushWarr: but if I'm giving them a deal, they're paying for closing costs
[1:23:22] Cosmolus: KEKW
[1:23:33] Zelkkai: in the army everytime you move you get an interest free va loan for a house so a lot of service members buy a house with it and rent it out so by the time their contract in the army is over the house mortage is paid off and they can sell the house for profit or move their.
[1:23:58] Antdavs24: KEKW
[1:24:01] jure__: time is money friend
[1:24:09] Gennzo: its science how that happens
[1:24:14] MARTZiiE: My landlords are POS, raise the rent by like 20 bucks every 2 years
[1:24:21] MARTZiiE: Greedy greedy people
[1:24:23] kalmenus1: @zelk9 kinda, check the fine print. Each time you redo the va loan it goes up 1% unless that’s only for retirement va loans
[1:24:34] Luthercorpz: I think a lot of ppl are cashing out on C.A properties LUL
[1:24:55] Zelkkai: @kalmenus1 if its a forced location move you waive the 1%
[1:25:08] jerexify: @Towelliee She's in the military, man. She's got the secret, inside information of an upcoming earthquake that's just gonna shake CA loose, right off the map...
[1:25:30] jason_tacey: AK's and cocaine LUL

[1:25:41] Luthercorpz: Turrets set up multiple areas
[1:25:42] kalmenus1: @zelk9 dad get his waived too. He’s 100% disabled. So he doesn’t get the 1% added either
[1:26:41] CritcobainTV: You can do all your dailies, the jailer thing and like like 3 rares til you're capped
[1:26:43] CritcobainTV: with the ring
[1:27:11] RushWarr: Off to work, congrats on the house. Well deserved!
[1:27:28] Racanelli96: @Towelliee what d you think 9.1 will be asbout
[1:27:38] CritcobainTV: por que no los dos?
[1:27:57] kalmenus1: That’s also the best way, you buy a house and don’t have to move. We moved about 2 months ago about killed me

[1:51:31] jaseff693: jaseff693 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:51:32] GhostsWasteland: Besides ashe is there any other reason for torghast?
[1:51:36] jerexify: Ah. I didn't know if some of that was considered "outside" or not.
[1:51:36] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee Why did you change your monk to a Highmountain? Was it because of the damage reduction racial?
[1:51:42] cabalish: there is a anima power mount
[1:51:51] josh8555: more vers
[1:52:10] jerexify: @GhostsWasteland Well, you do get some followers for your mission table in Torghast.
[1:52:11] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:52:13] Masqerader: blizzard you unlocked layer 8 tc for your alts, players "why though?"
[1:52:21] Zivs: I don't mind it, it's a pretty quick weekly activity
[1:52:41] GhostsWasteland: @jerexify Ahh thanks!!! didnt do much in it ouside of getting my 190 legendary, its suuuuper boring
[1:52:44] jbeastb: @Towelliee I'm having some difficulties running torghast on my new WW monk... would you reccommed running it as BM?
[1:52:53] Oakless11: I hate it
[1:52:59] MrGattz: islands was fun cause you can pull the entire map and aoe everything down
[1:53:11] GhostsWasteland: What do you think the time line will be before we can use a second leggo?
[1:53:16] Masqerader: Island had rewards and a reason to go back, Torghast not so much
[1:53:25] dreamwalker213: You can get legendaries from twisting corridors now too
[1:53:26] Oakless11: 9.3
[1:53:31] swampt1l: towHi @mrgattz
[1:53:36] danksly: islands were best maps in bfa wasted not being dungeons imo
[1:53:38] MrGattz: @SwapT1_ cohhHi
[1:53:40] Oakless11: @GhostsWasteland
[1:53:50] swampt1l: How are ya? @mrgattz
[1:54:05] madbombz_fth: jsut to tier 1 and go out every 6
[1:54:08] GhostsWasteland: @Oakless11 What patch are we on? I i've been spending most of my time playing on the AH
[1:54:09] TheCliffyShow: I liked doing mythic islands but that part of the group finder gets removed at 51.
[1:54:17] MrGattz: @SwapT1_ not to bad. waiting for poe launch in a few hours
[1:54:19] Bulgogiprince: shoot I grab a group real quick and finish both wings in an hour or so level 8
[1:54:21] theoriginalzinng: if i want to have a pally leggo for doing quests and torghast as prot is bulwark still the best?
[1:54:23] Xcenntric3k: @Towelliee u can snipe which corridor drop u r leggo with twisted
[1:54:28] Oakless11: 9.0
[1:54:36] Arcazua: you can just enter the first floor of layer 1 in twisting corridors till your legendary layer shows up
[1:54:36] dreamwalker213: @towelliee oh I would too for sure, but if that specific wing isn’t up that week you would have to, or wait until it’s up
[1:54:39] Gingerprimer: Yeah super nice for alts
[1:54:50] AverageNugget: Torghast is cake walk in terms of effort compared to island spamming
[1:54:55] Gingerprimer: if you just missed Troghast that drops your leggo
[1:55:06] swampt1l: Just cleared twisted corridors layer 2 on my mage and what a damn run super stressful LOL @mrgattz
[1:55:06] raldrik: I think the floor/level scaling in Twisting Cordors is scuffed. Layer 1 floor 11 and then floor 12 boss easy peasy. I hit floor 13 and my Veng DH gets 2 shot by some elites. I feel like they need to make the layer difficulty jump more and the floor scaling less
[1:55:31] Zigra1: @Towelliee do you have a command for your plater profile? i know you talked about it before
[1:55:33] CampB3LL: After doing tc normal torghast is even easier now cleared a layer 8 today in like 30mins and i didnt even have that good of anima powers too and im a spriest
[1:55:54] ColdChillXI: no life version
[1:55:56] board4life65: island had cap just 3 mythic island for a weekly 2000 ap
[1:56:10] jbeastb: Dude torghast is shit i hate it
[1:56:11] Oakless11: just ggo play diablo
[1:56:12] TheCliffyShow: Those sadists who play till they die in their chairs.
[1:56:22] Gingerprimer: @board4life65 you could still get more AP from isalnds
[1:56:27] dreamwalker213: THD LUL
[1:56:29] MrGattz: @SwapT1_ that sounds like a nightmare lol took me hours to solo layer 1 as a dps. had to switch to tank spec for the last 3 floors cause i couldnt even do it as a dps
[1:56:33] Clicklesly: Looking at the Corridors endless Torg would be quite a mess with scaling anyway
[1:56:51] AverageNugget: I think endless torghast in a similar application to proving grounds would be interesting in terms of achievements, cosmetics, etc.
[1:56:51] NivedTheBaldKing: i still gotta rescue anduin i have to get the 2nd clue and then another lol
[1:56:57] celzior: @Towelliee im leveling a veng dh just because i cant be asked trying to get 18 floors of torghast on my dk lol
[1:57:14] Captain_nShaneO: 35 anima Kappa
[1:57:27] sh1asurprise: @Towelliee I would like an Endless version if i could leave and come back to it.
[1:57:27] MrGattz: id be sooo pissed
[1:57:28] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee Why did you change your monk to a Highmountain? Was it because of the damage reduction racial?
[1:57:33] Will426: it would get so boring
[1:57:36] sMoKiE_1: I got screwed on Layer 6 Floor 17. I was mad as hell :/
[1:57:38] swampt1l: @mrgattz took me 4 hours on my mage :P
[1:57:44] CampB3LL: Is torghast gave gear i say ppl would grind it even tho it can be super boring
[1:57:47] denflup: how long till titanforging is back
[1:57:48] jbeastb: Isn't that the new thing? To change everything to appease a minority?
[1:57:49] CampB3LL: If*
[1:57:50] Gingerprimer: @TheCliffyShow yes and Vers boost
[1:58:01] Choadlol: Greater Rift in diablo is fun - that is up to level 150
[1:58:09] SorionTheGinger: @Towelliee i did endless proving grounds up to 120 for a useless rank at wow progress that no one will ever look at and for the challenge - buuut to be fair i couldn't bring myself to retry ^^
[1:58:12] Ryok: i literally tried for 13 hours to clear layer 8 TC solo and while i dealt tons of damage as DH shit would just literally oneshot me without cds at some point D:
[1:58:13] Brandonhipster: Man i love when people say they dont care for rewards in troghast. Im like SURE!!!
[1:58:22] Affiiance: Tauren looks better anyways
[1:58:24] board4life65: kappa
[1:58:30] Ryok: ended up having to do it in a group

[1:58:38] thebakeriscomingforu: the animations look good on panda but the gear looks bad
[1:58:50] Oakless11: but half fall damage though?
[1:58:56] dreamwalker213: Gotta be a female panda
[1:59:03] Ryok: and of course the built i got in the group was miles above any other built i ever got D:
[1:59:13] Affiiance: Yeah if I played Panda I would probably have to be female

[1:59:31] Brannax: I think endless would be fine if scaling stopped at a certain point. Id love a mode where I just get incredibly overpowered for hours; even with no reward. Dynasty Warriors gameplay would be fun for me
[1:59:37] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee Have to get the boot enchants for less fall dmg :)

[2:02:04] TheCliffyShow: Those people wanting endless Torghast are examples of people thinking something sounds cool on paper, but not really considering everything.
[2:02:10] thebakeriscomingforu: some anima powers are traps. best to avoid them
[2:02:13] redtemplar88: Is Brewmaster your second favorite tank, or are you playing them because they're really good right now?
[2:02:38] Masqerader: endless torghast, me after floor 5 "im good"
[2:02:39] Affiiance: I think they are trolls, no one really wants endless Torghast... Hell I dont want 6 floor Torghast LUL
[2:02:39] Masqerader: no

[2:05:16] CorruptedDreamsGaming: limits border crossing
[2:05:21] yunggluten: the boarder is closed still lol
[2:05:36] Wuxi27: teams are grouped by location and you only play teams in your group...and you do it like 8-10 times this season
[2:05:40] Masqerader: the borders are still closed, but since most nhl players are from canada or retain homes in canada(american ones) they are able to enter
[2:05:50] raldrik: There is only division play, top 4 make the playoffs
[2:05:58] akia03: have you tried arena on monk?
[2:06:24] gubadam: that mystic touch epic power is so useless

[2:18:48] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee thanks for the tip with the Kyrian Bell! Just got it on my Prot Paladin before it went away
[2:18:55] Masqerader: just send him some armor kits and flask, that will do lol

[2:19:05] snake_like: real voice
[2:19:09] Sandisy: when flying is introduced they should add another 8 layers and give a flying mount usable in the maw as reward, big troll
[2:19:10] Affiiance: There is no amount of money I would accept to carry ppl through Twisting
[2:19:28] TheCliffyShow: In the words of Dr. Evil, "$100 billion".
[2:19:39] Kolzko: I've already written off getting that mount. i don't have the time and will wait for a catch up in a few months.
[2:19:43] Frosixs: Everyone has a number
[2:19:48] PhillyDilly18: Every little bit helps at this point!
[2:19:54] Masqerader: everyone has a price for the million dollar man
[2:19:54] Affiiance: 300k? It would have to be a Mil minimum

[2:19:58] mary_1990_: koli_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! towHAMUP
[2:20:01] torridcheese3: @Sandisy Even worse, they could lock flying itself behind Twisting
[2:20:02] GhostsWasteland: how much ashe do you got for 18 floors?
[2:20:04] Cabbageman007: 300k is crazy low
[2:20:07] chrispape: shit Id prolly pay 300k lol
[2:20:09] showmethesugar35: or...just find group to do it
[2:20:20] knigghtmare: 18 floors is too much for 300k o.o
[2:20:24] MrGattz: a whole zero LUL
[2:20:31] GhostsWasteland: Whats the reason for twisting?
[2:20:37] Affiiance: A million isnt reasonable, but just for my sanity I wouldnt do it for less
[2:20:50] Kriven: I was not upset about the ash for twisting but they could have stocked that area with cosmetics at least
[2:20:54] CorruptedDreamsGaming: then they get MAD when it dont happen
[2:20:56] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:20:56] sevendot: it should replace the need to do the other two wings though. really grindy to have to do all of that and also your wings for the week
[2:20:59] Sollice: In TC you get 0.0 of anything
[2:21:08] TheCliffyShow: Then get mad because Blizzard doesn't give them the shit they made up.
[2:21:27] Vaedrun: you don't :D
[2:21:27] Arcazua: fun
[2:21:30] gubadam: cuz its fun Kappa
[2:21:40] Vivelli: "fun"
[2:21:47] robtwitch7777: Ive watched this guy for yearssss and ive never played this game Kappa
[2:21:48] Eekim189: They did say that TC was for the people that really liked torghast from the start, and that it was just for cosmetics
[2:21:54] Affiiance: Wtf we gonna do if they add new layers next patch?
[2:21:55] Senthius09: which is disappointing, should have had a full cosmetic set at the least
[2:22:15] Stariot: what mission addon are you using @Towelliee
[2:22:35] Zeijun: that is Venture Plan
[2:22:41] Sollice: @Eekim189 Hey no worries. We are down for the cosmetic(s) whenever those come out :P Just the mount
[2:23:13] Kriven: exactly
[2:23:36] Kriven: torghast could be fun with friends if they had tons of cosmetics and some rare drop mounts
[2:23:46] MrGattz: @Towelliee hey when you have a few mins check discord
[2:24:24] Ryok: i mean i liked torghast but after the misery of TC not so much anymore xD
[2:24:33] Coldlight1: im hoping torghast becomes somewhat like mage tower
[2:24:35] TheCliffyShow: You have to run Twisting Corridors ten times back to back in one sitting then you win...a hat that's a color of one that's been in the game for 10 years.
[2:24:39] Deathkanigit101: @Towelliee see i don't want normal cosmetics i want ability cosmetics. change they way my abilities look and shit. change it up from the normal stuff you get make it actually special.
[2:24:42] ssjshoutya: @Towelliee i dont have the maw mount and i still wont do all that 8 layers for that mount even if it could fly now
[2:24:49] Eekim189: Pet, toy, title, mount. Sure a mog would be nice, but i've been having fun with my guild doing it
[2:24:57] rsimpson105: Yeeehaw
[2:25:12] Senthius09: those should be glyphs
[2:25:20] Kromede: AP
[2:25:24] ZetherTV: wep enchants!
[2:25:31] Vivelli: so like warlock green fire style changes? a few of those would be nice
[2:25:32] fartmonster37: glyphs do change stuff
[2:25:34] board4life65: it already special with the covenant
[2:25:42] Sollice: I think thats what he means

[4:03:30] Masqerader: They took the randomness away, lol because spending the week doing keys and raids for a stupid vault reward is what he means LOL
[4:03:38] fluffk1n: mythic plus vender ?
[4:03:43] Thoreya: bring the bfa loot pinata back and i guess things will be back to normal
[4:03:47] MOLAR305: maybe if the anima was more than 35 it wouldnt feel so useless
[4:03:52] abbosss: I dont understand what the problem was with dungeon loot before, there's almost no point anymore unless you're chasing io
[4:03:52] Vivelli: 35 anima peepoClap

[4:05:22] blueteased: 35 x m+level, at least

[4:05:26] Kaykerrs: Hi Masqy ;)
[4:05:28] MistaHat: I just feel like they can make the same pvp system for pve dungeons and it is good enough. They also need to raise M+ gear to 213 on par with heroic
[4:05:34] luckfore: but that would make raids obsolete
[4:05:36] steelreign0080: Drop tokens instead of the gear peices imo
[4:05:47] kharnij83: if u 3 chest a +10 or abopve should be guaranteed 1 piece
[4:05:52] CelHeals: I feel like if you are able to time say a 15, the loot should be heroic equivalent, the rewards from M+ need to get buffed in some capacity
[4:06:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: dungeon token after doing x amount of them
[4:06:04] PG_diesel: Also, end of dungeon item levels need to be adjusted
[4:06:06] MistaHat: raids wernt obsolete last 2 expansions with the same system
[4:06:16] slowfetch: why the hell is terry not streaming
[4:06:16] manmower: m+ should just be a challenge mode, not a gear accumulation mode
[4:06:39] Masqerader: next time don't roll 7 on a ring fool
[4:06:42] MuttonChopins: they should just copy and paste pvp gearing/vendors into M+
[4:06:48] Ordicos: how about a bounty token for a boss like i have a token for Lady on Heroic and if you kill her you gain a piece of loot from her?
[4:06:53] misterwinoe: Pre pop sheet music like a potion
[4:06:56] GoldartheD: hey chat how do i get good at Raid: Shadow legends

[4:07:15] Kinghorn: got a 213 sheet music I have never used

[4:07:24] Urebaldd: I got the sheet music one too, it's annoying trying to catch them all
[4:07:41] partypooper0201: whats the name of the mission table addon?
[4:07:50] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i got u if u need a rogue ;)
[4:07:52] Kinghorn: the only thing sheet music is good for is being a universal trinket so you can trade any other trinket

[4:33:24] TexValhalla: Yeah it's pretty bad Kay LUL
[4:33:32] Kaykerrs: Whyyyyy
[4:34:10] TexValhalla: honestly? I main fury and I have straight up just not been enjoying raiding because we suck in raid atm
[4:34:19] TexValhalla: and then my favorite aspect of the game is m+
[4:34:26] Kaykerrs: Ooof I'm sorry
[4:34:30] TexValhalla: but we don't get any loot anymore
[4:34:39] Urebaldd: @GrittyTexan My main is fury too, it's hard man
[4:34:41] TexValhalla: so it's all just PepeHands for me rn
[4:35:00] Kaykerrs: I feel ya
[4:35:24] metavahn231: there's always some dps you stack in WoW LUL
[4:35:30] brain_wash: 68
[4:35:30] yoloswaglols: 69
[4:35:33] Stoneownz: 68
[4:35:46] gtmax69: Fury has been nerfed to the ground sadly
[4:35:47] KingsandClubs: 68
[4:35:52] STEELSOUL69GAMING: 69
[4:35:56] Brandonhipster: nice
[4:35:57] 107GOATY: @gtmax69 fury just got a buff.
[4:35:58] TexValhalla: but I'm prolly about to log on because I need to get back into it and at east try, run some m+ and catch up on covenant things
[4:35:59] Boioioioing: 69 Kappa
[4:35:59] sdpercussion: there's no run back if you missed trash so who cares
[4:36:17] gtmax69: @107fred Oh yeah? that is good news
[4:36:29] Kaykerrs: Carry me gritty LUL
[4:36:34] TexValhalla: yeah but it still didn't really make a difference for raid
[4:36:37] Urebaldd: Fury got as very minor buff that doesn't do much at all
[4:36:45] 107GOATY: @gtmax69 they were buffed the past two patches actually
[4:36:46] TexValhalla: i mean fury still slaps in m+
[4:36:51] TexValhalla: but raid
[4:36:53] TexValhalla: yikes
[4:36:54] Czyszn: 8% on all skills? that is godlike
[4:36:59] TexValhalla: no lol
[4:37:00] Urebaldd: in m+ we are ok, but raid is a joke
[4:37:03] 107GOATY: that's not true Fury is now the best spec for warrior in m+, and it's competitive in single target
[4:37:09] gtmax69: @107fred They need it. Im already commited arms so
[4:37:11] imperfectlie: fury pve is fine
[4:37:22] CritcobainTV: @107fred wut
[4:37:25] metavahn231: M+ is ranged or dk only
[4:37:37] CritcobainTV: @Veramer or WW, or rogue
[4:37:38] Kaykerrs: O.o
[4:37:39] jbmoongirl: You can fly back to the beginning after the last boss and get some adds there to make the percentage. I’ve done that before
[4:37:40] Czyszn: or Mistwalker
[4:37:46] 107GOATY: @gtmax69 try both. I built r3 signet and r3 deathmaker, playing with both. I go fury for some CN fights and arms for others
[4:37:52] TexValhalla: i actually want to level a dk, never really played one before but they look fun af
[4:38:11] gtmax69: @107fred Hmm thanks :D
[4:38:13] Brandonhipster: Can M+ be changed to DH/MM/DK+
[4:38:18] TexValhalla: i aint been on in 2 weeks what you mean @kaykerrs imma need that carry KEKW
[4:38:25] Kaykerrs: I'm leveling a shaman LUL I don't wanna but it'll be to supplement my resto druid
[4:38:30] mrpresbaby: sock on head inc?
[4:38:41] ThatW0lF: Buttons = pressed
[4:38:45] DudeThatsDope: @towelliee You don’t run blessed hammer for M+??
[4:38:50] 107GOATY: @critcobain you read it right dog, check the logs. Fury is on the rise and now definitely a stronger choice in m+. Deathmaker makes single target competitive. The only times arms is gonna be definitely better is 2-3 targets

[4:39:38] Czyszn: i seen the logs yesterday arms beat fury by 2%
[4:39:43] Brandonhipster: Gritty Mage is always a safepick
[4:39:44] Vivelli: for M+ on warcraftlogs fury is still lower on the stats for the last 1 week vs arms, so thats a hot take imo that fury is better.
[4:39:57] PhillyRhino: What legedary power do you use on your prot pally?
[4:40:00] Czyszn: yea fury is coming up!
[4:40:12] CritcobainTV: Too fucking bad Assassination rogue is still dog shit FeelsBadMan
[4:40:17] gtmax69: Fury has always been a fun spec
[4:40:20] Urebaldd: The initial cd burst on bosses is good, but sustained damage needs improvement imo
[4:40:32] TexValhalla: spriest looks really cool to me, I've dabbled in locks and love destro but hate affliction, and I really would only play fir mage
[4:40:37] Czyszn: fury is SUPER fun but when your a geared arms. idk arms feels so good when yo get like 10 condemns in a row lol
[4:40:44] steelreign0080: No one likes assassination rogue

[4:41:11] Urebaldd: Ass rogue need a rework
[4:41:15] Vivelli: i hope the trend continues that fury is going to overtake arms, cuz i like fury, but i cant see fury actually being better than arms YET.
[4:41:22] TexValhalla: i actually mained ass rogue from mists to legion
[4:41:34] TexValhalla: went back to warrior in bfa
[4:41:36] Rev_4_Life: arms plays better with condemn than fury
[4:41:42] Czyszn: i love fury for the transmog and the gameplay loop
[4:41:53] Czyszn: fury plays SO FUN i call it the melee hunter
[4:41:55] STEELSOUL69GAMING: no one likes my beast hunter they always like cant you go marks
[4:41:56] CritcobainTV: bro u jinxed it FeelsBadMan
[4:42:00] Czyszn: same amount of glowing buttons
[4:42:08] TexValhalla: i just love fury because there is always something to do with the class, it's just fun to play

[4:42:33] Czyszn: @GrittyTexan yes gritty. you go on fury at least 3 glowing buttons every second and if you got the leggo gg
[4:42:40] thebakeriscomingforu: a seasoned resto druid is great
[4:42:42] Kaykerrs: Towelliee you like resto druids wut? LUL
[4:43:13] Czyszn: arms is methodical its just like 1 set rotation unless you have condemn then its condemn x 10

[4:43:34] TexValhalla: which lego? i got the siegebreaker one, you talkin bout the one from raid? @Czyszn
[4:43:48] rAncrow: shouldve gotten the pack before the last necromancer probably
[4:43:50] Czyszn: yea from stone legion general the signet of tormented kings
[4:44:01] Czyszn: wait is that even a fury leggo lmao?
[4:44:12] Urebaldd: Yeah it is
[4:44:24] Czyszn: yea i leveled as a fury i loved it
[4:44:25] TexValhalla: yeah i haven't got that one
[4:44:30] Czyszn: then at 60 i went arms and i was like meh
[4:44:39] TexValhalla: the siegbreaker one is really fun though
[4:44:40] Czyszn: then as i geared as an arms i just fell in love with the big crits
[4:44:46] Czyszn: whats it do?
[4:45:11] CritcobainTV: Rampage has a 30% chance to use siegebreaker on your target
[4:45:17] TexValhalla: abilities have a 30% chance to cast siegebreaker on the main target
[4:45:21] Czyszn: :O
[4:45:31] TexValhalla: i've had siegebreaker up for almost 45 seconds before dude KEKW
[4:45:34] Urebaldd: Yeah the siegebreaker leggo is really good
[4:45:40] TexValhalla: it's op af at times
[4:45:41] Czyszn: lmaoo that sounds like crack
[4:45:42] ornyfex: Not even close
[4:45:57] Sollice: Are people enjoying the fury buffs? Or do they still need a lot more
[4:46:01] RunningOutOfRAM: Nice forces LUL
[4:46:15] CritcobainTV: @Sollice all this talk about fury but nobody cares about Assassination FeelsBadMan
[4:46:18] Czyszn: @Sollice they 2% behind arms now after checking logs yesterday
[4:46:20] TexValhalla: i really haven't played since the buffs @Sollice but i'd imagine they need more
[4:46:25] Urebaldd: Fury needs some tweaks still, rage generation needs to be better
[4:46:38] Urebaldd: Ass rogues get no love
[4:46:47] TexValhalla: but it really isn't just the actuall damage buffs, they really need a rework in general imo
[4:46:53] Sollice: People were saying Fury is very gear dependent and they will shine "later". That doesn't feel very great for "now"
[4:46:54] Brandonhipster: Glad they are doing buff instead of hard nerfing something
[4:46:56] Czyszn: but best dps based on logs yesterday top 5 was balance druid, mage, warlock, WW monks, unholy DK
[4:47:01] TexValhalla: OH SHIT
[4:47:17] metavahn231: wheelchair dk going downstairs LUL
[4:47:17] zaraine1: dk are slow there
[4:47:20] TexValhalla: I just realized the Holloway fight tomorrow is on ABC POGGERS
[4:47:24] Urebaldd: Yeah they are gear dependent but getting into a group for fury is aids because of that
[4:47:24] GermanBacon: towHi hello
[4:47:32] raptorstrick: Lol. He hates that
[4:47:52] Sollice: Yeah I would imagine so @Urebaldd Sucks even trying to find the groups
