[1:02:32] DiokoP: mario party would be awsome
[1:02:34] saltyfish: About yesterday?
[1:02:37] Encryptors: I feel like it's more of the script writing and the directing at fault. And also having Ezra Miller as the flash did not age well
[1:02:41] KingGoris: @KingGoris the best character in that whole movie was the penguin and he was barely in it

[2:04:03] Ez_Fn_Pz: Peak wow gameplay right here boys
[2:04:04] NiceGuyHobbsie: They fixed that way but you can still skip with a stealth i think
[2:04:04] snukstv: thats the kinda macro
[2:04:15] jakechams: skip with stealth. they patched that wall!
[2:04:21] BobbyWobbyWoo: @cjtaylor1994 leveling is fast and not horrible feeling aswell great for getting back into it
[2:04:27] shevek1337: chat is upgrading pvp items increase pvp ilvl?
[2:04:34] Youredoneson666: @cjtaylor1994 you can still do LFG on retail
[2:04:38] DyngbaggeN: shevek1337 no
[2:04:41] snukstv: your looking for but with mouse over mods
[2:04:46] cjtaylor1994: Thank you both
[2:04:46] shynomai: does shroud have his addon profiles linked anywhere or something?
[2:05:05] shevek1337: @DyngbaggeN so if I only play pvp, it does not matter if i upgrade items or not, am I correct?
[2:05:07] Ez_Fn_Pz: @shevek1337 just do low quality for pvp stuff, its the same in pvp
[2:05:08] iamdranzer: chat this game is free or no?
[2:05:23] Youredoneson666: @shevek1337 no, it does matter. it upgrades the pvp stats and pvp ilvl. whoever said no is lying
[2:05:25] osoi____: shroud AYAYA

[2:05:45] guapp_o: they double dip
[2:05:45] KEITHKILL11B: they do...
[2:05:46] Bleedorang3: They dont do that because it has a sub
[2:05:50] SGT_sunshine: hoping once microsoft acquires them, subs will be included in the GamePass
[2:05:50] osoi____: its gonna go on game pass Prayge
[2:05:56] lordmiki87: for sure never

[2:06:12] DyngbaggeN: shevek1337 Upgrading gear is only for PvE. So you can only get honor then conq gear for PvP so if you only pvp you dont have to upgrade.

[2:07:47] juuberi_: yeah
[2:07:56] Bleedorang3: Selling P2W transmogs in a game with a sub is GIGA lame

[2:08:30] selectivezero727: id go broke
[2:08:31] Ayjayyy: @Youredoneson666 thats its pve illvl, not its pvp ilvl
[2:08:32] AdamNicholsMusic: in MMOs everything should be earned in game imo
[2:08:37] ItssTurtle: me

[2:08:56] jukushin: pepeD lets dance bois
[2:09:00] sobben: cheapest entertaiment possible
[2:09:03] GriffBall40: i have never tried wow because it is sub based
[2:09:08] chrisuhhh_: i dont play because of the sub. I play on private servers LUL
[2:09:10] Ez_Fn_Pz: @GriffBall40 good choice.
[2:09:10] muddymental: I wish I knew how to play this game :(
[2:09:11] klaoz: there's too much money in sub based model, they'll never get rid of it
[2:09:11] bowsers1: if you cant pay your sub or have time to make golds then idk what ur doing
[2:09:13] Polarmensch: i fucking knew he was gonna get hooked to df
[2:09:21] Jakeysnakes13: @shroud what is that nameplate that calls out frontal and LoS??
[2:09:22] chosen_matty: id play if the sub went away

[2:09:41] ninjadabs: OSRS IS BETTER
[2:09:42] Polarmensch: @shroud u cant realease on the small bosses before the real boss. So technicly all these guys are part of the boss
[2:09:48] Ez_Fn_Pz: @chosen_matty you can get away with buying wow tokens for in game gold, which covers ur sub fee
[2:09:49] Moriala: what do we benefit from the game having more players? i dont like the idea of gear gotten by playing the game being obsolete
[2:09:50] PinnacleHigh: subscription means blizzard has to make quotas consistently. without a sub fee and when income is down for the term, they will push heaps of limited time stuff and it would just ruin how the game works. ESO does it and a lot of people dont play it because nothing feels special.
[2:09:55] jukushin: stack shet NOTED on feet with more shet NOTED

[2:10:15] zzodie: OSRS players are start to feel like rick and morty fans
[2:10:25] Youredoneson666: @draythe3 you can pay for your sub with in game gold. so you just play, make gold, and free sub.
[2:10:27] jukushin: @zzodie BasedGod
[2:10:32] Iittle_wenir_boy: im playing osrs rn

[2:18:27] Gatche: @Youredoneson666 It does for the most part, for some reason it doesn't let me use modifiers on mouse over casting, so I had to get Clique for it.
[2:18:29] lol_solace: dragonflight pvp is p good ngl

[2:18:58] p1ten: Hold shift to move things on your actionbars
[2:19:10] Gatche: @Youredoneson666 Yea it wouldn't do *any* modifiers for me, no idea why because any other weird keys worked
[2:19:28] godgrid1lft: anyone know if the current WoW deal of free 30 days stack with the epic editiion? so 60 days total

[3:45:26] slimjimsilver: omg i need that weakaura string
[3:45:34] hamlinzloot4life: lost ark is üí©
[3:45:35] Thoreya: enhance was top dps on the last liquid kill in raid
[3:45:37] matching_towels: what site you using? warcraft logs or raider io?
[3:45:54] pollerbeer: A lot of the DPS rankings are based off Warcraft logs. It gives you a good idea of a classes overall performance.
[3:46:03] itschad: mplus subcreation @matching_towels
[3:46:04] tvilk: raiderio doesnt show logs for boss kills
[3:46:09] masonk95: enhance is awesome rn but never a need for more than 1 in a raid
[3:46:12] matching_towels: ty
[3:46:19] Phractals: @Thoreya also not helpful for the average player. the meta is basically completely irrelevant if you're not playing at extremely high levels
[3:46:39] galaxyxxdd: it's not %
[3:46:46] Thoreya: @Phractals exactly, like they had fury and mm being bad....turns out theyre top. which makes pugs not inv those 2 to groups
[3:46:53] Thoreya: its bad
[3:46:56] imanhyp3r: hey shroud what do think about shaman nerf ?
[3:47:03] Phractals: @Thoreya yeah i agree
[3:47:06] Mal_XO_: @Thoreya and they buffed the shit out of MM
[3:47:10] pollerbeer: @Thoreya After recent buffs MM is top 5 on DPS rankings\
[3:47:16] tvilk: @Phractals Meta doesn't matter, no. But specific classes have specific utility. Like the aoe soothe from drachtyr is useful for more than just the 1%
[3:47:29] erfanjemp: they only nerf shamy on PVP no change for sure
[3:47:33] masonk95: @Mal_XO_ nerf tuesday
[3:47:35] Thoreya: MM is getting nerfed next week lol. after their buff, goes to show ppl didnt know how strong they were
[3:47:58] pollerbeer: MM, WW, and enhance are getting a 3% nerf. Shouldn't matter much\

[4:51:23] ChubbyMikey: j9 a hipster
[4:51:29] prestige_kr: 382 is minimum. you can get that up to 392
[4:51:58] Qoning: other people craft them
[4:52:02] CannaBlastr: crafted
[4:52:04] Qoning: buy on AH
[4:52:23] lessk0: wow with asmongold soon?
[4:52:30] Apo2g: isnt neck 2?
[4:52:36] prestige_kr: just make sure w/ the crafter that it's still guaranteed/very high chance of 5 star with the embellishment. it makes the recipe harder
[4:52:41] Qoning: you got a primal infusion?
[4:53:01] resgesta: just get weapons prio with crafting @shroud
[4:53:15] ImSwooShTV: enh shammy good??
[4:53:16] BULLandBARRETT: !howtoplay
[4:53:30] prestige_kr: look for someone who can GUARANTEE you 5-star
[4:53:31] Meliodas7M: damn that made me dizzy
[4:53:33] Qoning: neck and weapon for 2 sparks
[4:54:02] memostar: recraft is almost basically free anyway, no need to wait for ilvl upgrade materials
[4:54:04] zXMrGreenXz: can u show ur talent build for M+
[4:54:33] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[4:54:34] resgesta: some of weapons can crit more but do less dmg- one of them can balance dps
[4:55:04] Joeyexez: So if it does more max dmg also it can do less dmg than the other wep
[4:55:59] Valisan: except you cant unless its a guild order
[4:56:10] sm0kyz: did he like the expention ?
[4:56:13] NickFPV: @Valisan except you can if its a personal one
[4:56:14] resgesta: Find r4-r5 crafter man
[4:56:15] nemzky: you can only specify the quality if its a private order though
[4:56:23] nemzky: so you need to find someone first
[4:56:28] Nicoarv: You can only specify the quality on personal orders, not in public ones
[4:56:47] resgesta: like i said @shroud
[4:56:47] nemzky: Different low end too @shroud
[4:56:48] Sos1: minimum dmg is higher
[4:56:50] BigJ707: yo @shroud what weak aura are you using for your shaman abilities
[4:57:02] Pown77: its same dps
[4:57:07] Luzel2005: You would solve a dream if i can come on a m+ with you love your streams keep it up
[4:57:09] Mauios: !ui
[4:57:10] StreamElements: @Mauios, he's using ElvUI: https://bit.ly/shroudElvUI
[4:57:12] Varilus: @shroud its same avg dps but different min-max
[4:57:15] moonteryjack: shroud load your character into raidbots droptimizer
[4:57:25] moonteryjack: will tell you which is better
[4:57:33] Pown77: you can have higher dmg but with lower and the other is less high but less low too
[4:57:48] Qoning: nothing on retail really takes that into account anyway these days and since you hit so fast, its just vanity
[4:58:10] qson0: goofy aa game
[4:58:12] MalakiDaSimp: is this classsic?
[4:58:15] probufflol: the new crafting system is so fucked imo
[4:58:22] PsyNytes: retail @MalakiDaSimp
[4:58:38] brummE1337: @shroud its normal, it depends on min-max dmg roll on them. Some just have a higher min/high roll - but the DPS is the same of them
[4:58:40] Valisan: check what multiple people are using, I wouldnt base that off of just what 1 dude is doing
[4:58:42] Luzel2005: You would solve a dream if i can come on a m+ with you love your streams keep it up
[4:58:47] memostar: nice to be rich in the game :D
[4:58:47] MalakiDaSimp: @PsyNytes wow retail?
[4:58:53] PsyNytes: yup
[4:58:55] Qoning: its way better to find a crafter with mace/axe spec
[4:59:21] matching_towels: is dagger int only? or agi too?
[4:59:24] Pown77: dagger isnt for enhanc
[4:59:39] Daegin: do not do dagger for enhance

[4:59:47] xXZimmerzXx: do orc still get +damage to certain weapons?
[4:59:48] matching_towels: yeah dagger is for resto shaman
[4:59:56] insaniity: shammys can't use daggers LUL

[5:00:01] movaria: yes
[5:00:04] prestige_kr: you want someone who can VERY high chance 5-star
[5:00:23] unna1ural: aren't you cold?
[5:00:25] prestige_kr: since you're doing an embellishment, you prob wont find someone who can guarantee it, but that's fine
[5:00:33] benarse: one page back
[5:00:39] 10qDirtyDirty: ?
[5:00:47] Rh1n: @insaniity but caster smanas use dangers

[5:02:22] AllUKenEat: this sht was very unintuitive at the start
[5:02:23] insaniity: KEKW
[5:02:25] c10starburst: LUL
[5:02:28] Croufu: BRO WTF IS GOING ON LOL
[5:02:30] hotboooi: KEKW
[5:02:32] JFr3sh: so 392 base and then use primal infusion to increase item level @shroud
[5:02:37] Jojo_Dolo: noppFairy
[5:02:39] Purgency: they really arent explaining it to him very well
[5:02:40] movaria: lmao do they know what theyre even talking about
[5:02:40] NoandThen: max quality not max ilvl
[5:02:41] mokapot_enjoyer: you can recraft later @shroud it's nbd

[5:02:53] TheySeeMeRolly: 385-392 then 392-405
[5:02:59] TheySeeMeRolly: 2 bracket ranges
[5:03:00] SaMiUL071: KEKW WAYTOODANK
[5:03:09] nemzky: @shroud max level crafters have a better chance at making high quality gear. Thats why you want a max level crafter.
[5:03:12] brummE1337: @shroud Max crafters have a higher chance to roll it higher, it have a min-max roll. Think it goes for 392-405 (the higher the better chance)
[5:03:12] pepsyy1: what is so hard to understand about it...
[5:03:17] Jozolino: ITS 382-392 based on qualiy
[5:03:19] Luzel2005: You would solve a dream if i can come on a m+ with you love your streams keep it up
[5:03:46] AllUKenEat: idk y they dont allow min qual for public, makes it useless
[5:03:48] mokapot_enjoyer: learning Madge
[5:03:53] godmagicman: @danhills95 complaining univnited is dookie
[5:03:54] Joeldftw: dragonflight is so good
[5:03:59] prestige_kr: he might ask you to set it to 4-star or higher. it's very rare to find a crafter who has 100% chance at 5-star w/ missive and embellishment
[5:04:00] matching_towels: it needs the ability to easily purchase all the stuff you need when viewing the options, its disjointed atm
[5:04:05] kovi_lol: !time
[5:04:06] StreamElements: @kovi_lol, Mike's local time is: 06:46:15 PM PST

[5:04:21] certainbud: How long has shroud been playing wow like what was his first expac
[5:04:35] Qoning: i mean i guess its to force people to look for interaction but eh

[5:04:50] NickFPV: @nemzky this is why
[5:04:52] ZallenXDDD: Forcing interactions
[5:04:57] Razzin_: reason is that they want you to interact with people and find your own crafter

[5:05:52] PsyNytes: Please relax with that @Luzel2005 :)
