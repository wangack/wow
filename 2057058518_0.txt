[4:50:43] RushTurok: Adam: Total testosterone levels can be influenced by various factors and might not reflect the active, bioavailable testosterone in the body. Free testosterone, on the other hand, represents the portion of testosterone that is readily available for use by the body's tissues and can provide a more accurate picture of testosterone status.
