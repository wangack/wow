[0:20:07] Thowarr: @tvilk Pretty much; if you wanted title, you probably already have it. CE? Same. After that, not much else to do except go play other stuff

[0:24:43] harmless52: tettles about to rage log
[0:25:20] t4pekid: more like deadles amiright
[0:25:45] endakenny: Tettles should play a real spec
[0:25:48] bojackhorseman2004: oh no, its tettles
[0:25:51] bojackhorseman2004: i dont like him :(
[0:26:13] bojackhorseman2004: he made a video where he said that pugging was bad to improve your skill level
[0:26:49] tvilk: tettles stop pinging Madge
[0:27:13] blisskissz: yeah tettles likes to hear his voice
[0:27:40] bojackhorseman2004: i said wrong, i dont hate tettles
[0:27:44] harmless52: i bet his hair looks dumb right now
[0:27:45] bojackhorseman2004: just hes opinions and things he say
[0:27:52] tvilk: @harmless52 stupid sexy tettles
[0:27:54] zachl_: bro i have a concert tonight aint no way u go live......
[0:28:05] epilepticunicorn_: tettles is sick. he tells me what blizzard is fixing in M+ days before it happens
[0:28:31] Tsaebahcus007: Is MW a good healer spec to play as my first healer spec for m+?
[0:28:34] Tsaebahcus007: Experienced as melee player
[0:28:42] zachl_: right now, yea
[0:28:54] tvilk: if you like having a lot of buttons, yeah
[0:29:33] Theliahh: @zachl_ who are u seeing
[0:29:41] froshington: Guten Abend Waffelkatze <3
[0:29:53] zachl_: my favorite ! poptropicaslutz!
[0:29:55] Tsaebahcus007: tbh disc is strong and looks daunting to play
[0:29:55] bojackhorseman2004: are there any hard classes in this game?
[0:30:00] Theliahh: great band name
[0:30:10] bojackhorseman2004: think hard classes is a mythi
[0:30:39] Tsaebahcus007: hard is relative, but some are harder than others to minmax
[0:30:46] bojackhorseman2004: like?
[0:30:50] tvilk: @bojackhorseman2004 no, but also super subjective. Some people will say Warlock is hard due to the lack of mobility and forced hardcasting, while others will say Fury Warrior is hard because of the high APM. Super subjective
[0:30:51] Tsaebahcus007: gap between good and very good outlaw is quite big compared to other classes for example
[0:30:52] Tsaebahcus007: imo

[0:31:16] bojackhorseman2004: every "hard class argument" is just people saying their class is hard

[0:31:28] juno_sha: Dogege
[0:31:30] Tsaebahcus007: not really, i dont play outlaw x)
[0:32:17] tvilk: outlaw just has a lot of minmaxing you *can* do.. meaning to play it as a decent level it's pretty easy, but it also has a lot of room for improving
[0:33:14] reppap: Hello Cat
[0:33:50] AyeLoud: Hey I live upstairs and i've been getting Jam through the floor. You been pumping that shit up?
[0:33:50] daggerd314: alma seems like a better lust than the witch idk
[0:34:00] tvilk: At a base level you can get a long way with Outlaw by playing around Subterfuge uptime, but the RTB and KIR situation is what makes or breaks Outlaw in harder content
[0:34:02] zachl_: on fort yea
[0:34:32] talkley: boomie tal;king GoodTake

[1:39:42] FrabjousDaze: MONKA
[1:39:49] Destrolisher: delves should give myth track gear
[1:40:04] FrabjousDaze: world quests should give myth track gear
[1:40:07] vellocets: drama?
[1:40:16] Thowarr: Thd basically wants the vanilla game, as well as removing all class buffs. Anything outside of raiding he doesn't want
[1:40:17] spacecow5: There should be a track above mythic, delve tier
[1:40:20] flockheart: DRAMA?
[1:40:26] FrabjousDaze: last boss myth track trinkets should drop from world bosses Kappa

[1:40:47] FrabjousDaze: perfect Zach
[1:40:48] zachl_: thats not feasible
[1:40:50] badfo: He just wants to infinitely grind artifact power
[1:40:51] Destrolisher: why would they need to raid when they can delve
[1:40:52] juno_sha: raiding is dumb
[1:41:03] zachl_: i agree with u guys raid is dogshit
[1:41:09] zachl_: but they wouldnt do anything like that
[1:41:15] Blloood: So Elden ring when?
[1:41:18] FrabjousDaze: let us dream Zach Sadge
[1:41:22] Thowarr: @badfo he wants an infinite grind, which is the ultimate vanilla mode. 5 rep per 10 mobs kills. He'd be in heaven

[1:41:52] Vyndrodis: can you blame thd though? Man loves grinding his games so of course he is gonna advocate more ways to play the game he wants to play
[1:42:13] trench_toaster: i wouldnt mind if raid gear only scaled to heroic/normal ilevel max inside of m+, and the reverse for m+ gear. not sure what the exact scaling would be but just to ensure your best in slot would come from the content you care about mainly
[1:42:22] trench_toaster: but give you a starting point if you wanted to swap content
[1:42:29] Thowarr: @Vyndrodis he can def advocate it, but the game has evolved past that. The people who like that go play classic
[1:42:31] zachl_: all keys should cap u at either 483, 86, or 89
[1:42:46] badfo: nah he doesn't want more, he just wants one and it's infinite grind

[1:47:21] lapissuu: HUHH
[1:47:22] Thowarr: @Vyndrodis It's not a dismissive argument; grinding for rep in classic is an actual grind where you need to turn in a shit ton of mats either for minuscule gaines, or go kill thousands and thousands of mobs for the same small gain. This is OG classic. The game evolved past that and the grinds have become significantly/faster because the playerbase overall does not like it
