[0:44:36] SockiSauce: EU server?
[0:44:39] Mecabeast: is mega potion flavor any good?
[0:44:49] DelcoAF: @deathritetv so they are just releasing the same game? so you just get to replay the quests???
[0:44:54] Skylin3r: though i didn't check if Tankadin2 works
[0:45:09] Templexx: it was stupid high. but now it seems too low
[0:45:09] Daggerstry: I wouldn't say retail sucks. I still like retail. I have things to do
[0:45:12] JQ47: yes it was
[0:45:14] VeranuTree: No its too low now
[0:45:14] PawgersHC: Thats what I have heard, it is equal
[0:45:15] Meandro_Gaming: its even lower
[0:45:16] PawgersHC: to back then
[0:45:18] magemaster225: yeah but they had a longer prepatch
[0:45:19] rosina_scarlett: it's lower
[0:45:24] Kelmor: not the same as then
[0:45:25] PawgersHC: oh damn, lower?..
[0:45:26] CritcobainTV: It's the same as it use to be yes. But the issue comes from the fact that the prepatch is 1/3 of the duration @Towelliee
[0:45:28] alex12645: not even close
[0:45:29] SnikenTV: Not the same
[0:45:31] w1ns1ow: honor changed in 2.3
[0:45:31] cdk058: pre patch was also longer
[0:45:31] loken1: No it’s lower
[0:45:33] NexLap: 6 week pre patch vs 13 day prepatch
[0:45:33] ssanakk: they had a month long prepatch
[0:45:34] Collected1: yeah but 2 weeks pre-patch versus how many weeks?
[0:45:34] VeranuTree: HK's are giving  way too low honor
[0:45:37] Fennaboys: How do you get from Silvermoon to Orgrimmar? Is there a portal like in retail?
[0:45:39] rosina_scarlett: but back then we had a longer pre patch
[0:45:42] randumgingaboi: isit worth leveling a char or wait till the boost?
[0:45:45] timcopious: I am a classic newb and want to get into TBC but I am overwhelmed as to where to even start like realm wise and faction wise :/
[0:45:49] Kelmor: I think Swifty has video
[0:45:53] bumpstock75: time gating ?
[0:45:56] MetallicusGaming: sprucetreeboy07 you can alrdy boost
[0:46:05] DrillOut: its impossible now to get gear within this short prepatch
[0:46:05] Skylin3r: nice gathermate2 updated
[0:46:09] SnikenTV: @timcopious Try out urself and just enjoy the game
[0:46:09] DrillOut: thats the point
[0:46:14] Ridonc: hammers up!
[0:46:20] ArcaneSyntax: the problem is that even if it is accurate, then there's basically no reason to play then.
[0:46:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: i really didnt want to pvp anyway so its whatever to me
[0:46:33] milleroid: so there's literary no chance in hell you can get r14 gear with the current honor gain?

[0:46:48] SnikenTV: @milleroid you can but you have to play a shit ton
[0:46:50] Kelmor: it did, so who knows
[0:46:50] ofnaldreya: Then they should reduce teh cost of the current gear
[0:46:52] abruptdecayO_O: most people were grinding out cap for level 70
[0:46:59] MetallicusGaming: IF you guys want it like back in the day, FINE then  no Draenei and Blood elfs untill BC launch
[0:46:59] Skylin3r: @TherealmannyZ luxthos weakaura
[0:47:00] NexLap: @Towelliee  i'm just trying to get gear for leveling and i might get enough honor for 1-2 items
[0:47:02] Znza: yess, soda is goin to be grinding marks for tbc gear, says he'll get honor capped way before he gets all his marks
[0:47:03] jvandelli: So @Towelliee if we are diving into Classic BC, is it worth going to our race city to get a crafting spec at level 1? o.O
[0:47:03] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee honestly they should just nerf the honor costs of the 60 pvp gear and it'd be fine.
[0:47:11] flandre619: mix of people wantin to have all of their 70 pvp gear already farmed and boosties wanting welfare epics
[0:47:22] rhodeos_: its fantastic for alts

[0:47:27] DrillOut: exactly they should reduce the honor required to get the gear at least with this time
[0:47:28] rhodeos_: and boosted toons
[0:47:36] xavier2119: @bifronsx welfare epics lmfao i love that
[0:47:43] NexLap: why no keep the honor high and then do a reset on launch day
[0:48:00] Shugaze: the tbc blue pbp gear was considered trash and useless
[0:48:11] abruptdecayO_O: dude i got two pieces and had no clue the values were wrong

[0:48:19] Znza: @Towelliee my buddy got both his weapons within like 8 hours lol now he aint getting a single peice of gear afterthat
[0:48:22] ActasTV: does tbc solo friendly in leveling?
[0:48:28] kvadratsmart: @deathritetv same
[0:48:36] MetallicusGaming: actasdh yes
[0:48:49] falldrgn: its ok.. some quests will require a group
[0:48:50] RocketvanPersie: far more friendly than vanilla
[0:48:50] Parkway1088: They nerfed it 10x. It should have been a lot less. Honestly they could have sold more boost leaving that honor that way, and just have it reset at 70. whatever, typical blizz. FUN DETECTED
[0:48:53] NexLap: the only issue i see is the 58 boost gear is so terrible you couldn't even try outlands in it
[0:48:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna play devils advocate here and say that r14 gear was suppose to take a long time to get in classic and it feels weird that with the honor we had that you could do that in a couple days.
[0:48:55] bigbutteredbeans: What did you end up boosting? @towelliee

[0:49:24] BTiZZY_: what did they change?
[0:49:26] dexxzor: and prepatch is only 2 weeks lul
[0:49:28] DjLamboImBenz: WINS

[0:49:44] bitstep: you use any addons to level? just starting a draeni shaman now
[0:49:46] NexLap: it will take 6 days played at 30 min games to get enough honor to get r14 gear
[0:49:51] StarbuckTech: the sweaty pvp nerds will do it
[0:49:56] MetallicusGaming: yh and before pre patch it took you like 6 months just to get the ranks, stop complaining LUL
[0:49:56] onyx_pupper: is this prepatch liek the actual release or june 1st i dont know what it means really

[0:50:05] DrakhanGaming: Based off how tbc prepatch is goin, seems like wrath classic isnt even happening
[0:50:23] lunchbox_hoagies: they should change it to the same values, then equalize with time difference for prepatches
[0:50:23] KralYoshii: sneakibutt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[0:50:24] NexLap: 220 per ab win
[0:50:26] Kelmor: They will fix it, because of the short time and the fubar
[0:50:27] NexLap: 180 per wsg
[0:50:27] CritcobainTV: I think nerfing the honor by 50% was fine. 1k honor per AB, like 1500 for an AV and its not bad
[0:50:28] Collected1: giving us a two week pre-patch proves they dont give a fuck imho
[0:50:28] devoted_bee: Dual specs is all that I want :(
[0:50:33] dalaraz: @DrakhanGaming ?????
[0:50:34] Znza: lmfao you only get like 200 if you win, 20 if you dont
[0:50:38] EthicalHermit: at 70 do you get more honor?
[0:50:42] Daggerstry: Nah. It is supposed to be classic. You get classic level honor gains
[0:50:54] kruumms: You have 5 in bag
[0:50:55] dalaraz: true id take dualspec anytime in bc
[0:50:55] cybbers_: is the honor rates at 70 going to be higher?  Twinks get less in classic before the Prepatch
[0:50:55] kruumms: bank
[0:50:57] Zavier420: @Towelliee What do you think Blizzard would be like today if Activision had never taken over?
[0:51:01] NexLap: @Daggerstry  and pre patch should be 6 weeks but it's not
[0:51:07] ArcaneSyntax: And if they're really worried about exploits at 70, they can just change the honor costs to be 10% of what they were
[0:51:12] MrKhanes: Let ppl have fun in this shorts pre patch all the gear will be replaced soon anyway

[0:52:28] zenniik: @Towelliee is it faster to lvl in tbc?
[0:52:32] ossivar: Lets be honest, the only people complaining about honor are the people who have just jumped back into the classic experience and aren't already geared from playing the game for the last 2 years

[3:32:03] Drakonus12: @Vexxsis i take it i could find the cost of lvl 70 pieces on WoWhead or something right?
[3:32:17] Vexxsis: @Drakonus12 for sure
[3:32:18] greatvaluegenji: quests give more xp in bc
[3:32:35] Broomba: thats like RAF XP numbers
[3:32:37] MetallicusGaming: dustlaf like 30%
[3:32:40] skaya86: For me the best thing is landing like 50% more hits than classic
[3:32:40] Warjun11: questing in classic zzzZZZ

[3:33:52] bigdaddystunna: are warlocks going to be overplayed in tbc? should I jsut boost a mage
[3:33:55] Molvonos: Yea, guildies definitely make the difference.  If I'd been by myself, i'd have never glanced at Classic/TBC again, since i'ddone that waybackwhen.  Community makes it magical.
[3:34:07] Vexxsis: @Drakonus12 i need the gear lol i stopped playing after gearing in bwl
[3:34:19] Aaradin: I resemble that
[3:34:20] Warjun11: that bear sound is the only bear sound that was recorded by humanity

[3:35:03] Broomba: rip towelliee the druid in classic
[3:35:18] Drakonus12: @Vexxsis ya im sitting with aq40 gear, and 2 pieces of t3...but dont want to drop a bunch of gold on the rest of t3
[3:35:28] Rehsto: @Towelliee Races don't matter in TBC, right? Debating on what race to roll for a mage
[3:35:41] Vexxsis: @Drakonus12 yeah R14 just easier
[3:35:41] theDirtyon3: Holy Fuck KEKW

[3:36:14] Broomba: 1 month ? really
[3:36:14] akia03: message a gm and they fix it fast
[3:36:15] Rehsto: @Drakonus12 if thats the case, then it would be a debate between troll or belf
[3:36:27] Rehsto: Extra silence or increase cast speed buff
[3:36:38] Austei: for like 10 hours that poor npc
[3:36:39] Drakonus12: id go belf or undead

[3:37:05] Rehsto: hmm
[3:37:12] CritcobainTV: OMEGALUL
[3:37:24] Broomba: just boost a druid when bc goes live
[3:37:24] NetherRegion: when does the boost happen?
[3:37:31] Drakonus12: @Rehsto it depends how hardcore you want to be. im not sure if troll is the best race to go for pvp
[3:37:40] CritcobainTV: 40 dps**
[3:37:43] Rehsto: HC in terms of what
[3:37:45] daweda45: Does marks and honor carry over TBC??

[4:59:37] uawildcat04: @Towelliee where should I go to level a fresh 58 boost as Alli?
[4:59:50] jerexify: @Towelliee Is it just SM that's more difficult for mages to boost people through now, or does it apply across the board? Or do you know?
[4:59:50] sadlyboyy: @towelliee where r u lvling for lvl 20 til 30?
[4:59:55] GamerNesto: wotlk close second expansion
[5:00:07] GamerNesto: after that most expansions were doodoo
[5:00:20] PotbellyGoat: I'm reading the first chronicle book now and it's crazy how much more there is in WoW
[5:00:52] synnicul: @Towelliee IM in a SM with a mage now. 30 runs 0 deaths, dudes a god
[5:00:55] jerexify: So once you get up to 30 or so you can get boosted elsewhere, then. That's good.
[5:01:03] CritcobainTV: @jerexify It's definitely harder across the board, but mostly it just takes longer to kill mobs, some dungeons like SM cath, the mobs are acting slightly different, so i need to use a new build with the water elemental to freeze them in place apparently, still waiting on the video to learn it
[5:01:20] CritcobainTV: @synnicul ask him if he's streaming, i wanna watch so i can learn it lol

[5:03:30] SonofHorus82: I think either WoD or Legion are 2nd when it comes to fighting major lore characters in raids and dungeons.
[5:03:37] cbiskit89: what about doing actual runs of WC, SFK, BFD, etc until 30? wouldn't that be faster than questing
[5:04:30] MasqureMan: @cbiskit89 that’s a lot of time and organization back in the day
[5:04:41] MasqureMan: @cbiskit89 isn’t BFD like 5 hours?
[5:05:05] ThatDisguise: I really want to get into WoW and dungeons but nobody to play with. I find MMO's boring alone :/
[5:05:36] cbiskit89: @MasqureMan true but he has a healer and a dps already and is one zone over from SFK that's why i asked
[5:05:45] MasqureMan: @thatdisguise I feel you on that. There’s moods to play alone and in group content

[7:42:40] Epicfell: I am dumb.
[7:43:11] Broomba: someone hasnt done any content in the 9.1 ptr and is making ignorant statements
[7:43:13] smashwow: just because it has a character doesn't make the fight good. the mechanics make the fight good. i just hope they don't fall short on those fights.
[7:43:27] Honvar: What am I? 🙃

[7:43:44] mavericks312: @smashwow all the bosses in the raid sao far have been dope af
[7:44:02] cosmoflake: @towelliee it saddens me that tazavesh won't become a m+ dungeon until 9.2...
[7:45:08] cosmoflake: ya but you wont do tazavesh more than the first few times since you cant upgrade the loot
[7:45:10] Jeddek_: I personally feel like they will just extend Shadowlands for a longer than normal cycle so that they get 9.3 in, and then next expac go back to the ~2 years
[7:45:13] Honvar: I want to play WoW but I don't want to play WoW, if that makes sense
[7:45:23] Honvar: again*
[7:45:24] cosmoflake: but yeah i get what u mean bro
[7:45:34] Caylex: @Honvar im in the same train
[7:45:49] hectabit: wait tazvesh won't be a m+ dungeon next patch? Being stuck with the same 8 dungeons for m+ is gonna suck.
[7:45:56] Jeddek_: @Honvar I'm the same. I'll go back in 9.1, transfer to another server to raid and then hope to stay there forever
[7:46:17] Jeddek_: 9.0 just burned me out
[7:46:44] Bayne77: i just want to be mad Kappa
[7:46:49] smashwow: 9.3 if it's good would help that sell
[7:46:55] Honvar: @caylex I've played the first week of SL but none of mine friends play WoW anymore...
[7:46:57] soysos91: I'm mad cuz I missed the ice cream truck
[7:47:01] TheGiant99: But wouldsnt not getting 9.3 only matter to the hardcore nythic raiders
[7:47:05] hectabit: well getting KSM next patch is gonna be pretty easy then
[7:47:14] Yagr6: i want them to take like a 5 year break and make a good expansion
[7:47:16] Jeddek_: @Towelliee My guess, is they do a 2.5 year expac. 9.1 in August, 9.2 in march/April, 9.3 in july/August, 10.0 in Jan/Feb
[7:47:22] hectabit: its just a new seasonal affix
[7:47:27] Caylex: @Honvar almost the same xD ive played 1 ~2 months and now nobody i know is playing anymore
[7:47:54] mavericks312: kh3 had 13 years and the game was still trash
[7:47:55] TheGiant99: They should just make WoW 2 and stop the expansions
[7:48:03] Broomba: @Jeddek_ then ptr for 9.2 and 9.3 has to be quick with beta testing -- timing doesnt add up
[7:48:18] Ardailec: That's how you get Duke Nukem: WoW edition
[7:48:27] Waspire: i hit 60!!
[7:48:27] Caylex: @TheGiant99 with new stories and main characters? that looks dope
[7:48:43] Waspire: on juzarus
[7:48:44] cosmoflake: 9.1 will drop 29th of June probs
[7:48:54] Jeddek_: @Broomba I was just giving a random example of dates

[7:49:00] KingSpud91: wait what? where are these dates coming from?
[7:49:15] Dkgungo: they should do it like call of duty does have 2 teams working on 2 different expansions giving each expansion more development time
[7:49:15] MoonChocolates: What if there  was a WoW X FF14 crossover event. Kappa
[7:49:15] hectabit: 9.3 in August isn't gonna work unless the next expac isn't until 2023
[7:49:28] Honvar: @caylex Like I want to play, but I know when I pay for a sub I won't play it anymore after x amount of days
[7:49:33] CaptainAlkohol: whats the problem with 2023

[7:52:51] Gameriders: @TheGiant99 if the same team currently working on wow would work on wow 2, it would be the same stale game
[7:52:54] goretera: honestly the only mmorpg i have any interest in and we dont even know anything about it yet is what Riot is working on.
[7:53:02] Farenheight451: That inn keeper is letting his marshmallow burn

[9:53:33] Broomba: hes just trying to justify doing it
[9:53:35] Dkgungo: i think its just a act for content

[9:53:54] Bayne77: with kindness and understanding?

[9:55:38] pikajazz32: pikajazz32 subscribed with Prime.

[9:56:01] Cheezwhizz: too be honest who cares who boosts   ... we all the love the game we love to community    just play the game make friends   move along  ya know
[9:56:02] ShadoodHD: wake up sheeple
[9:56:05] Artivicii: he dont practice what he preach
[9:56:06] Rylexthegreat: Good or bad he is getting all the attention he so desperately craves
[9:56:07] MiddlePhaze: facts
[9:56:09] idenkaz_: i mean everything he ever said is "unvalid" KEKW literally
[9:56:12] ratboy432: Put some fruit and cream around the dick. Makes it more edible.
[9:56:16] Kackandu: going the same route blizzard went before him ^^
[9:56:17] Revelations45: trust is a hard thing to come by these days
[9:56:24] Holysal: Asmon is the Clay Travis of video games
[9:56:29] Dkgungo: i do thing asmongold is just a character these days thats an exaggerated  version of zack
[9:56:29] brotherkirk: If he didnt buy the boost then his whole community would do it anyways LULW
[9:56:37] idenkaz_: KEKW
[9:56:43] slowfetch: right wing troll
[9:56:43] ShadoodHD: im still debating on what to boost lol
[9:56:45] Cookiedropz: KEKW
[9:56:47] lifeswings: I think the community boosting where you can't do anything in game without paying up is WAY worse than the lvl 58 blizz boost
[9:56:47] denflup: how long until blizzard adds wow token to classic TBC?
[9:57:05] dalaraz: 2 years
[9:57:05] SleepingBagGaming: lul

[9:57:23] Aidler: asmon is basically also the chicken wing of WoW
[9:57:24] slowfetch: he is irl but not his content anymore
[9:57:27] Holysal: hes a sports guy on fox radio
[9:57:37] Bassmanbruno: Clay Travis sucks
[9:58:07] Herzenliegen: Yea they still hit hard
[9:58:23] BigGameBob: yes
[9:58:28] slowfetch: sports and he started mixing with politics

[10:00:11] slowfetch: @Broomba yup! he's king of hyperbole
[10:00:18] Rapapep: !wa
[10:00:18] Moobot: @Rapapep we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[10:00:20] dalaraz: those spits is extra content for his stream
[10:00:25] Holysal: We all know he buys mounts from the store
[10:00:30] warrenny: @slowfetch Hypocrite more like
[10:00:33] Rylexthegreat: Real question how long before he "retires" from streaming again? LUL
[10:00:51] Broomba: @slowfetch hes a sensationalist
[10:00:54] Holysal: @rylexthegreat 2 months after TBC
[10:00:58] Kinghorn: NOBODY PANIC
[10:01:06] slowfetch: @warrenny tbh if someone said hey you can make millions by spouting some bs all day, i would totally do it
[10:01:09] Moonori: shouldn't crucify him for it, alot of people are aginst it but will use it for sure
[10:01:21] warrenny: @slowfetch Oh same
[10:01:30] Aidler: not sure if he also does 9.1 before retireing
[10:01:33] LeBigNose: chat who we talking bout?
[10:01:38] nocturnateGG: I boosted a pally and honestly wish Blizz just offered an XP boost instead cause I really would have preferred leveling but wanted to have a 60 before TBC :'( , working on leveling a hunter atm though and hoping I can get close before launch
[10:01:49] nisk___: Cries and stamps feet about MTX and Boosts then gleefully takes part in it for some pretty COPIUM reasons.
[10:02:01] mavericks312: he is 100% a hypocrite
[10:02:01] cry_havik: Hypocritical
[10:02:04] VGDocs: Well does he dislike the boosts specifically or just the overabundance in microtransactions?
[10:02:05] nameless27: agreed
[10:02:12] SinfestDK: What is the name of the WA he is using for Time this level?
[10:02:15] solsaver12: Then make a guild
[10:02:18] dalaraz: hey guys its super but you shouldnt support it,but ill do it anyway cause why not
[10:02:19] zaeden8: asmon did that smh
[10:02:20] altlife7: and make money off it
[10:02:22] Cookiedropz: i mean it is typical from asmon lol
[10:02:25] ANDeBOYY: VoteYea
[10:02:26] Orthobullet: Some people dont like tax loop holes but i would sure use them
[10:02:26] Skeezitz: thats an addict talking
[10:02:30] Rylexthegreat: He is saying YOU should do it. Not him, but YOU Kappa LUL
[10:02:32] warrenny: Hence why shit like new world happens
[10:02:35] doomdrake13: its like "don't do drugs kids" *SNORT*

[10:02:39] Broomba: i think its border bipolar
[10:02:47] H8BUSTAcap: If this is rly BE why is he not a BE ret paladin?!? :O
[10:02:50] slowfetch: who boosted? asmon?
[10:02:53] nameless27: if you dont agree with something you shouldnt do it! Especially if you are so influencial on other people
[10:02:55] thomaspxo: the mount looks amazing in retail. it's "summoning" make it worth the wow token to blizz balance price tag
[10:02:59] Molvonos: @Broomba Not bipolar.  Hypocritical.
[10:03:02] Skeezitz: cocaine is a hell of a drug
[10:03:03] ShadoodHD: what's done is done, now he needs to face the consequences kekw
[10:03:09] dalaraz: he aint bipolar,its his stream persona vs rhe real him pvping out of control
[10:03:09] nisk___: but if its offered to me Ill SNORT A RAIL
[10:03:11] rillo5: It’s just the equivalent of a shock jock on radio. They’re entertaining but can’t really put any stock into what they say
[10:03:12] doomdrake13: hahahahhahaaa
[10:03:13] Herzenliegen: LOL
[10:03:17] VGDocs: Well is he against the boost specifically or just the overabundance in microtransactions?
[10:03:19] Mitchendo64: his argument is time. A boost saves you 200hrs but a store mount does nothing
[10:03:21] doomdrake13: you are welcome.
[10:03:21] markmclean24: I wanna sniff that shit
[10:03:23] ANDeBOYY: WOW LMAO

[10:03:40] aTufo: did consecration get bigger?
[10:03:48] ZagFan590: Gamers suck at "speaking with your wallet" type boycott. CoD made $3B alone in MTX last year and it is only going to keep going up.
[10:03:49] xsp00n: Well i meeaaaan....slavery is bad, but if someones going to do the work fooooor meeee thheeeeeen
[10:03:54] nisk___: Asmon is huffing heavy on the COPIUM
[10:04:12] ANDeBOYY: @shac20 VoteNay
[10:04:20] Sevcikova: The name calling against boosts for how long?.. then turn around and do it.. shows a man with no convictions or pride..MO
[10:04:22] TheNextKing306: his ego prevents him from the temptation

[10:04:27] nocturnateGG: Chat what's the overall opinion on boosts? Is it gonna hurt the game in the long run or?
[10:04:30] SinfestDK: What is the name of the WA he is using for Time this level?
[10:04:35] Rylexthegreat: Hes that one guy that tries to get everyone into a fight and stands back when the fist start flying LUL
[10:04:40] VGDocs: I think it's fair to have a position against overabundance of microtransactions and still go for boost because a single boost isn't the underlying issue
[10:04:42] spyderman62: wtf dude @shac20
[10:04:46] Moonori: I think it's just too good not to use... but ye i get what you're saying
[10:04:48] Broomba: im calling it hes digging his own grave and he  doesnt know he is doing irt
[10:04:56] dalaraz: @nocturnateGG bots will,boost is w/e
[10:05:01] idenkaz_: most people dont give a shit about boosting, they just want to play the god damn game. thats how most people see it. lets be real.
[10:05:19] curbie510ttv: nose candy?
[10:05:33] GonoFPS: whats the diff between buying a boost vs paying a mage to spam dungeons lol
[10:05:34] heath_wow: Bc it is more crazy to not take an advantage
[10:05:39] GonoFPS: people always complain
[10:05:43] wommy: wow token shouldnt be in game  but since it is i take advantage of it sometimes
[10:05:44] H8BUSTAcap: "I like hypocrites" basically what you just said xD
[10:05:48] heath_wow: You not taking it doesnt
[10:05:48] TheNextKing306: ayo for boost yayo
[10:05:55] nisk___: Asmon is like Andy from The Office, got everyone to skip the SATs then sat them and got 1400.
[10:05:56] warrenny: Tbh I’m not that bothered but that vid was good
[10:05:57] solsaver12: exactly towel
[10:05:58] Maruika: i think the distinction was in a brand new game vs and old game like wow.
[10:05:58] smileyfrown: true
[10:06:04] TheItalianStallion321: @Broomba i just feel like he just loves toxicity and his groupies just follow him anywhere he goes or says. i blame the people who support him, not himself

[10:06:23] mitchumtx: You aint 30 yet my man?
[10:06:26] Broomba: @TheItalianStallion321 i believed that for a while, i think he is literally slipping
[10:06:33] nameless27: but if you boosts from players thats how the world developed and blizzard didnt had a hand in that
[10:06:36] Eviltuna13: is there a command to see the mob names farther away?
[10:06:38] dalaraz: @Towelliee you should do a stream where you ask for donations and spamming wow for 20sec when you get gold
[10:06:43] Hank_ish: @towelliee do you watch NBA?
[10:06:51] Maruika: then its hypocitical as hell
[10:06:54] TheItalianStallion321: @Broomba gotcha, i dont disagree with ya
[10:06:54] wommy: boost is like wow token. shouldnt be in game but since it is u just take advantage of it
[10:06:56] Sevcikova: His boosty boys guild he created today
[10:06:57] Broomba: @dreioo yes hes burning a lot of bridges
[10:06:57] Moonori: naa he won't do it
[10:07:00] aTufo: i think he said in the twitlonger that he wont be playing new world if they put that in
[10:07:02] nisk___: helps that most of his audience are 15
[10:07:02] xsp00n: But towelliee, the content
[10:07:07] telethen: people bitching and they  probably bought a boost to level some toon 14 years ago through some other web site
[10:07:09] Moonori: he said with new world he just won't play it
[10:07:10] Holysal: all the private server players complain about the mtx. but they buy 32 slot bags, mounts, boosts on those server LUL
[10:07:13] Wadjaah: They just don't care anymore
[10:07:14] brotherkirk: you aren't cool enough to understand
[10:07:16] dreioo: he said he ONLY applies this to WoW because he's addicted LUL
[10:07:23] Recaud: i just got an ad for tbc classic. ha.
[10:07:31] dreioo: @Broomba you said it better LUL
[10:07:34] Broomba: @TheItalianStallion321 it was a stick, but i dont see that anymore
[10:07:36] BobLongMVP: its a clinical addiction lol
[10:07:42] dalaraz: he has multiple respawns,you can /tar iron @Towelliee

[10:07:49] Domi98_: he said he will play
[10:07:50] nisk___: he willplay it cos he will get 100k views
[10:07:52] H8BUSTAcap: I wonder if WoW was really as big as it was... or was it because WoW gold was worth more than the currency in Venezuela?
[10:07:53] flebbooo: ofc he will play it LUL
[10:07:53] mavericks312: asmon fiends are something else lol
[10:07:54] Colt_Engineer: what classic andy are we talking about now?

[10:08:41] Aethn: Asmongolds??  He said on stream like 2 days ago he cant wait to play New World again LOL
[10:08:42] Colt_Engineer: if it's azmongold we're talking about, money
[10:08:42] NovaSun84: It's ya boy AsmonContent
[10:08:42] VGDocs: Well is he against boosts specifically or just too many microtrasnactions?
[10:08:50] ShadoodHD: cant choose both mah dood KEKW
[10:08:51] VertLIVE: is it bad to follow metrics but still shed light on numbers?
[10:08:52] GonoFPS: have the hunt use humanoid tracker like a champ
[10:08:56] Dixietwist: @Towelliee  u cant explain anything to the asmon cult why waste ur breath lol
[10:09:12] Mr_Abeon: downstairs
[10:09:17] Streamcrush: do a /tar
[10:09:18] H8BUSTAcap: make a target macro and spam dat shit!
[10:09:20] dalaraz: he has a spawn upstairs left side @Towelliee
[10:09:22] dillapuss: so blizz stated that the cross realm thing going on is a bug and that they have fixed it and yet its still happening lol
[10:09:34] dreioo: @Trogdor8freebird he's against boosts and he'd rather they weren't in the game as they ruin it BUT he'll buy it because it's available so you'd be STUPID not to take advantage of that as a competitive player
[10:09:36] LucidAntics: just /tar captain and mark him
[10:09:41] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee well asmon isnt a man of values or principles. He doesnt really believe in right or wrong. So hes all about what gives him the advantage, even though he prefer the advantage to not be an option.
[10:09:46] NovaSun84: It's ya boy AsmonContent
[10:09:49] alkazam_gg: what streamer were we talking about btw?
[10:09:49] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[10:09:56] heath_wow: Because just a few players not getting the boost isnt going to change the reality of them still being in the game, so it is possible to say boosts are bad, and still realize it's too huge of an advantage to pass up
[10:09:59] Rylexthegreat: He has zero credibility and zero integrity. Never has and never will
[10:10:02] elmokid1: Are we able to boost draenei and belfs once patch drops?
[10:10:03] Decoz: I dont agree with you, he just loves the game so much he will keep playing wow no matter what blizzard will do to the game. The game can be so much better and that pisses him off....
[10:10:07] Xanafriel: @dillapuss it's a bug that will be fixed in an upcoming patch or something, depending on the bug not surprising
[10:10:09] GonoFPS: @dreioo bud 'competitive players' all have a bunch of nax geared toons waiting
[10:10:24] LucidAntics: lol this chat's take on asmon is actually trash.
[10:10:43] H8BUSTAcap: lol... how are you guys trying so hard to say integrity is worthless xD
[10:10:49] VertLIVE: why are people so hostile towards asmon in here xD
[10:10:53] Holysal: looks like ppl can recover their lost badges now
[10:10:54] corncob78: !TBC

[10:11:00] brotherkirk: He's probably afraid of the content drought
[10:11:03] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee but asmong doesnt buy pets and mounts
[10:11:04] TheItalianStallion321: @Towelliee you make perfect sense
[10:11:05] DangerZoneJunky: It's called hypocrisy, and yes
[10:11:07] hectabit: but i just wanna be irrationally mad
[10:11:12] dreioo: @GonoFPS yeah pretty nuts. Now they can buy an alt and be even more competitive (?) I have no idea man I keep it simple: levelling for months LUL
[10:11:16] GonoFPS: you'd have way less people playing tbc and then the same people will complain that the servers are getting dead
[10:11:22] xsp00n: they are trying to double dip to get the monies, they get the side that is against it, and then later they get the excelerated content that MTX gives
[10:11:24] dalaraz: asmon is arguing for the sake of arguing since his return to streaming
[10:11:25] GonoFPS: Poooound
[10:11:25] Decoz: Yes of course! but who is going to do anything about that? No one
[10:11:34] zekobunny: I hate the fact that there is a boost, but if I wasn't a third world boi I would def buy it just because I can so I see your point

[10:11:43] bobbycagg: !realm
[10:11:47] Broseidon7624: cant reason with hypocrites
[10:11:50] brotherkirk: if you establish a hypocritical viewpoint early then you can violate it constantly without question
[10:11:54] heath_wow: Just bc you are apart of the problem doesnt mean you are the determining factor of whether or not the problem will continue to exist. its not as simple as you are trying to make it out to be
[10:11:54] VertLIVE: asmon and towliee wow debate live on twitch, that would be content LUL
[10:12:08] LySiS75: even if has a problem with wow he cant stop playing it. Look how much money he is making off of it
[10:12:13] altlife7: @morfiend_ it's not complicated
[10:12:13] dreioo: @VertLIVE it would be more civil than you think
[10:12:13] Mr_Abeon: this might sting a bit
[10:12:27] NovaSun84: do as I say, not as I do 4Head
[10:12:30] lymesperhour: Asmon is just a character, the real person acts differently
[10:12:32] VertLIVE: @dreioo it would be really great I think
[10:12:41] TheItalianStallion321: why support a hypocrite who just wants your $$. again, i blame the people supporting him
[10:12:46] br0fest0r: boar got the zoomies
[10:12:47] dreioo: @VertLIVE I wouldn't miss it
[10:12:54] GonoFPS: dude I see it this way we lucky enough to have classic servers to begin with
[10:12:56] Moonori: go to Allcraft and talk to him about it =p
[10:12:57] Rylexthegreat: He loves the game so much that he cant help but to be hypocritical LUL
[10:12:58] doomdrake13: At some point you gotta overcome your addiction. I was REALLY stoked for Classic, but after some actions from Blizzard I decided not to support them anymore. Now I have around 400$ of Battlenet gift cards lying around LUL

[10:13:02] VGDocs: Asmon shouldn't have boosted- that said, the response can be way too hostile imo
[10:13:06] Aaradin: I feel like the boosts just save people time, which I'm fine with.  Can't really call it pay to win because you're not winning shit in all greens lol xD
[10:13:15] xsp00n: said streamers just suckle at the teat that is content, and don't care what values the go back on as it brings in viewers and viewers = $$$
[10:13:18] Gothbrud: Zack is great. His persona Asmon not so much. People need to differentiate between those things so they don't paint him in a way he isn't.
[10:13:26] dreioo: @doomdrake13 yo help me get some HotS skins fam!
[10:13:41] brotherkirk: They need a lich king transmog for WotLK and see if he buys it KEKW
[10:13:41] H8BUSTAcap: oh lol he IS a BE ret paladin this must be BC xD
[10:13:53] Artivicii: yeah he can plead addiction lol
[10:13:53] warrenny: Sounds familiar 😂
[10:13:58] Ardailec: Could also just be Occam's Razor: He's full of crap.
[10:14:02] Lesrek: @skutteskutterock547 They don't need to differentiate because his online persona is just as much him as his offline one.  What he puts out there matters
[10:14:04] dreioo: @palytv I busted my drink all over my lap
[10:14:04] dalaraz: asmon has to go against a system,thats his whole content @Towelliee
[10:14:07] GonoFPS: spend week in dungeons lmao
[10:14:10] zekobunny: 1-60 on release was good because there was nobody to boost
[10:14:17] solsaver12: yes
[10:14:24] Krelivane_: It's a sad reality
[10:14:30] GonoFPS: yeah I did 1-60 solo quest on Faerlina everybody was in instances lol
[10:14:31] H8BUSTAcap: pffft I lvled up my tank to 60 quest grinding while everyone in my server was tryin g to pvp before pvp even started :(
[10:14:45] lymesperhour: leveling is part of the game, it's the journey about learning the game and exploring the beautiful world. boosting to me is like paying for a less of a game
[10:14:54] dreioo: @GonoFPS dungeons until level cap...what a sad way to play the game
[10:14:59] rillo5: asmon is a shock jockey. He gets reactions, but you can’t take his words at face value
[10:14:59] Moonori: people go aginst what they belive in all the time bro. that's how we all are
[10:15:09] LySiS75: so boosting is a good thing?
[10:15:21] dreioo: I mean it;'s sad for ME you play however you like <3
[10:15:21] heath_wow: Asmons personality as a gamer has always been low life shameless stereo type... It's a part of his toons character... he will not deny this. he braggs about it all the time
[10:15:35] DangerZoneJunky: the thing is we have a proven market for RMT / boosting.. it's gonna happen one way or another these days w/ so many forms of communication
[10:15:36] GonoFPS: its ok but dont turn around and compain about a 58 boost that players wont experience the game
[10:15:40] GonoFPS: lmao :P
[10:15:41] ObanXIV: dungeon grinding is for rep
[10:15:45] heath_wow: its part of the entertainment he offers..
[10:15:53] nisk___: The Journey to SM
[10:15:55] solsaver12: I notixed that alot
[10:15:56] Holysal: and its efficient
[10:15:58] Wildside1177: Rep Rep rep - dungeons make so much sense to do in BC.
[10:16:06] VertLIVE: I did not stick with classic as long as I thought I would have
[10:16:08] dreioo: I met some great people last year just questing in Classic
[10:16:12] ObanXIV: dungeons are more for rep than they are exp
[10:16:17] coffeeatm: LUL journey LUL
[10:16:17] hectabit: wait how does someone spam dungeons without a dungeon finder tool?
[10:16:24] solsaver12: At least on Pagle lots of ppl are out in the world questing
[10:16:45] Trawkey: Only thing im thinking is why should anyone decide how i play the game? shouldnt that be up to me?
[10:16:49] heath_wow: You are befuttled
[10:16:50] dreioo: @solsaver12 PvE server?
[10:16:59] brotherkirk: what if he wants to destroy wow since streaming has already ruined it for him?
[10:17:02] Krelivane_: Classic was all about the journey > Dungeon spam and min/maxing > You better be the right class and spec
[10:17:04] SonofHorus82: @hectabit go to a dungeon, let a mage run the dungeon for you while you afk, head outside and reset, repeat.
[10:17:04] Dkgungo: i stopped trying to understand asmon a long time ago
[10:17:08] blocasaurus_rex: very refreshing to hear this
[10:17:15] Roddox123: u do the logout 2nd toon reset trick.
[10:17:17] bimtron: the new starting zones are so much faster for leveling holy shit
[10:17:27] TreySyd: what server is this?
[10:17:31] blocasaurus_rex: blocasaurus_rex subscribed with Prime. 
[10:17:33] VertLIVE: was clone service only for launch, or can you make chars in vanilla and transfer them to tbc later on?
[10:17:44] elmokid1: When do you think theyll allow new races to be boosted?
[10:17:47] idenkaz_: he is good with words and thats about it.

[10:17:53] nameless27: do what I say not what I do
[10:17:55] Krelivane_: It was incredibly hypocritical in my eyes
[10:18:05] VGDocs: There's a separation between theoretically correct and practical application with him- he thinks it's correct to not have certain things in-game. That said, he doesn't recognize the practical implications of him boosting and what that means to the community/blizz
[10:18:09] heath_wow: You are totally misunderstanding Asmon it is actually kinda of funny...
[10:18:18] crispybacon2009: i feel like he was doing it for "stream content"
[10:18:26] MiddlePhaze: who's ian?
[10:18:28] xALcaPWNedx: ff14 seems to be growing too
[10:18:33] nonstopdisco: who are we talking about? just joined

[10:18:35] Rylexthegreat: And then get butthurt when you get called out for being a hypocrite
[10:18:39] Krelivane_: @MiddlePhaze Ion the game director
[10:18:41] LySiS75: all about money bro
[10:18:42] NovaSun84: I agree @Towelliee ZombieKappa
[10:18:42] lancer32: It was hypocritical, and the least he could do is own it.
[10:18:45] VGDocs: I disagree with that one. His chat is full of people disagreeing and insulting him
[10:18:49] dalaraz: too many truers :p
[10:18:57] wommy: how is questing can you tell us your /played

[10:20:21] crawcook: I think he treats wow like that because he knows the game very well so it’s not the journey for him anymore, but when he played Nee World I think he genuinely enjoyed the journey part
[10:20:26] Wildside1177: Camp T has quests
[10:20:33] tyrel_jones: Or SO Barrens
[10:20:33] Lupine_Fury: ashenvale

[10:21:32] dalaraz: bfd is your level range
[10:21:41] tyrel_jones: That’d be a good zone
[10:21:43] Broomba: 24-31
[10:21:45] zekobunny: Ashenvale is terrible for questing
[10:21:56] dalaraz: start west for ashenvale,then east @Towelliee
[10:21:57] Wildside1177: Get a Deadly Blunderbuss from the AH
