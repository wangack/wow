[0:59:34] AlexikonTV: there are several shockadin builds around since back in 2008. theres not "the one shockadin" build
[1:00:01] AlexikonTV: there are some going into ret and some going into prot
[1:00:11] CryonicBlue: he said NOT :D
[1:00:46] AlexikonTV: ret has much higher dmg while prot is almost unkillable in arena for example
[1:00:47] CryonicBlue: Swifty should go into a quest IRL to get a new Affliction t-shirt
[1:00:49] BoricuaSJ: BoricuaSJ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 116 months, currently on a 116 month streak! finally hit lvl 77.. lol slow and steady is the way. (also speced as a Pally Tank...way better for leveling!)

[1:01:24] johnny90sk: shocadin is nice, but people doesnt like that cause you are not healing as much as holy, and not doing top damage as ret. :D
[1:01:33] bager90: hey hey
[1:02:07] Kaphrpant: there was also a weird build prot for avengers shield and the rest of the points into ret
[1:02:28] CMack_72: someone has to protect the graveyard
[1:02:29] Nightcult: this bg was really bugged the few times I played it
[1:02:30] CryonicBlue: The give up is strong in some teams
[1:02:41] AlexikonTV: @johnny90sk a good shockadin can burn u to 20% health in 2 globals. for dungeons it doesnt matter what u play for healing since they are a joke and shockadin is extremely strong in arena and a lot of fun in bgs
[1:02:50] AlexikonTV: its not about being top in either heal or dmg
[1:02:57] plates_the_hunter: Man I always liked the idea of strand, but I hate strand in reality lol

[1:53:48] Skulligan79: @wingskills Yeah but with that macro you have to actually target the gargoyle first
[1:53:54] plates_the_hunter: so /target Ebon Gargoyle then /cast Turn Evil
[1:54:03] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:54:25] CMack_72: not /cast target.   just /target
[1:54:31] plates_the_hunter: Usually with minions you need to /target first, then /cast
[1:54:34] tydresh: fr bums
[1:54:57] tydresh: KEKW
[1:55:22] Wingskills: think theyre saying make it 2 liner, first is /target ebon gargoyle and second is /cast turn evil
[1:55:27] Skulligan79: try /cast [target=Ebon Gargoyle] Turn Evil  -- This only works if your target is the Ebon Gargoyle.  So you would need /tar Ebon Gargoyle first, then /cast Turn Evil
[1:56:26] ClanWestc: @Swifty why not duel witih a dk a test it?
[1:56:32] plates_the_hunter: The one you have now should work

[1:59:47] tSnekk: its flat dmg increase vs lucky +5 oercent crit on heal
[1:59:58] Skulligan79: 5% is only worth it if you stack a bunch of crit, though, right?
[2:00:21] complexified: that glyph is useless cuz sacred already give u 50%
[2:01:01] thespudc1: does the 5% crit add to your 27% or is it 5% of the 27% ?
[2:01:12] complexified: I think thats perfectly fine you're not gonna be spamming it ina  fight its just an occasional heal imo

[3:47:27] Extrexo: is sacred shield on gcd? you could probably macro it to other buttons if it isnt
[3:47:37] splicketylic: another little tip as well, is try to time your instant flash heals when your sacred shield is proc'd, 25-50% better chance to crit ^^

[3:55:47] ask_peter: make repeat every like 5 sec
[3:56:02] merwinsbeard: the point is to be annoying so you keep it up... however I would only load in combat so when you are chilling you dint have to keep putting up shield
[3:56:05] Jay_Vee_NL: LUL
[3:56:26] falcor101: make the sound happen only while in combat? Maybe that'll help

[5:51:12] Madara2008: Horde racials are generally better for pve so min maxers are more likely to roll horde

[12:20:52] Cockadoodledoohoo: Your tanks need to be healed at all times on this boss, healers shouldnt be healing the dps, that is the main problem here.

[12:21:26] Karenej67: Cockadoodledoo - I would agree with you!

[12:23:07] TrueNorthGG: honestly dps is pretty low
[12:23:17] apsosn: Ah, I see the mistake you are making
[12:23:27] Karenej67: anyone rez Hyper?
[12:23:29] calivarr: 3 tanking is wayyyy easier than 2
[12:23:31] Atlas62: because of beacon?
[12:23:31] Reddikus: anyone not pulling over 3k needs to get kicked
[12:23:39] apsosn: nono it's not the dps
[12:23:45] rouladee: never seen so many dks do no dmg

[12:24:33] Spwaffles: Swifty is broken..... and so is his gear
[12:24:36] Brokenarrowz107: dps looks fairly low
[12:24:37] treeshade: use your 3 cooldowns
[12:24:38] nificus: If you aren’t a tank, make sure you are not in front of the boss!
[12:24:41] TrueNorthGG: prog raid on patchwerk 2022

[12:24:48] AllenzoTV: LOL o god broken gear
[12:25:00] Fightmypala: what healing lokms
[12:25:02] Gelzar: To be fair, dps being low isn't the reason for wipe.
[12:25:04] Rektdone: @bizre doesnt work that way, aggro is based on highest hp
[12:25:11] Gelzar: I think it's lack of knowledge, pve is just knowing what to do really.
[12:25:12] Reddikus: what kinda raid doesnt have repair bots lol
[12:25:39] nificus: ***
[12:25:48] Karenej67: If this was an LFR you can't pick and choose. I have had others in a group kick me because I wasn't geared enough, etc... and I'm like - GEEZ that's why I'm running this Raid - to help get gear... geez! :D
[12:25:49] Spwaffles: I mean it's ez to repair in town and get a lock summon back
[12:25:53] Gelzar: WoW is full of repair bots
[12:26:01] Rektdone: hateful strike is based on HP @Swifty
[12:26:03] schneid4: melee need to step in the green so they dont have high hp
[12:26:08] Reddikus: tell your tanks to use figurine of the colossus from tbc
[12:26:08] bizre: @Reddikus why wouldnt 3 tanks have more hp than the dps?
[12:26:30] Reddikus: Gear
[12:26:41] AllenzoTV: perks of playing on skyfury... never queues, and locked.
[12:26:45] Spwaffles: @hakyun youre right
[12:27:00] thegoonies: we stick our meelee in the green goo at pull
[12:27:08] Gelzar: Really though, this is all part of the raiding experience. It's a breakthrough when you beat him. Keep ya head up
[12:27:09] Reddikus: i wish my pally was 80 id hop in and help lol
[12:27:15] AllenzoTV: There use to be queues
[12:27:17] waruiagueronotori66: 1 raiders from waruiagueronotori66 have joined! 
[12:27:30] Karenej67: Does anyone if Patch is affected/effected by the green goo?
[12:27:30] apsosn: @switfy the melee gets a debuff and has to go into the green water to get rid of the debuff and tank's  tank turn a bit so the back from patchwork  are to the green water should be better
[12:27:38] Gelzar: I recommend the raid leaders to fully explain the fight, if they don't know it look it up.
[12:27:54] Reddikus: what def trinkets are your tanks using???

[12:30:13] au_chilli: It wasn’t an easy fight early on either, not a huge amount of leet dps at this stage, do need 3 decent tanks and the right buff group
[12:30:19] Reddikus: PALLY
[12:30:24] NoRaidPlesk: show the other 2 tank gear
[12:30:31] SkunkJuice090: @industry_ their warrior tank is very well geared for this early in the game. the problem is healers not using holy light.
[12:30:32] Truth2223: @industry_ One that doesn't die
[12:30:37] Karenej67: @Swifty Are you liking your Paladin?
[12:31:13] Karenej67: @industry_ LUL
[12:31:15] TheBigGigz: I dont think Rock is def capped
[12:31:25] Truth2223: gate
[12:31:33] Hempwarrior420: Nah the problem is massive over healing instead of reactive heals
[12:31:43] Reddikus: yeah i agree that dude might not be def capped getting wrecked
[12:31:50] 009dreamscape: YEAHBUT7TV
[12:32:04] Truth2223: @Hempwarrior420 Hes off on timing imo
[12:32:08] Reddikus: def cap problem then?
[12:32:13] nificus: you have to rotate cds to survive the dmg
[12:32:26] SkunkJuice090: @Reddikus reactive healing is how you wipe on patchwerk for 5 hours alkXD you have to be healing the entire time not waiting for a tank to take damage.
[12:32:29] apsosn: the melees gets a debuff and has to go into the green water to get rid of the debuff // AND RET pally please """DONT USE " Divine Storm !!!
[12:32:33] SkunkJuice090: over healing isnt a factor in wrath, ignore that stat.
[12:32:35] Reddikus: tank prolly tryna parse with dps trinkets on lol
[12:32:37] Spwaffles: When i pala healed this fight... just bacon of light hateful tank and just spam flash of light non-stop... I had to switch fingers cause I was cramping
[12:32:39] Hempwarrior420: You reactive heal by pre cast/canceling
[12:32:51] Hempwarrior420: Dedicated healers tones tank
[12:32:57] vivimaus: the hits come alleways in like 3 sec so you could heal like this > damage comes in you cast holy ligh then wait 1.5 sec then cast holy light again this would then hit right after the incoming hit and then you wait again and cast again
[12:32:59] Hempwarrior420: To each *
[12:33:02] Truth2223: When tank starts dieing HOLY LIGHT and Shocks
