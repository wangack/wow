[0:59:34] AlexikonTV: there are several shockadin builds around since back in 2008. theres not "the one shockadin" build
[1:00:01] AlexikonTV: there are some going into ret and some going into prot
[1:00:11] CryonicBlue: he said NOT :D
[1:00:46] AlexikonTV: ret has much higher dmg while prot is almost unkillable in arena for example
[1:00:47] CryonicBlue: Swifty should go into a quest IRL to get a new Affliction t-shirt
[1:00:49] BoricuaSJ: BoricuaSJ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 116 months, currently on a 116 month streak! finally hit lvl 77.. lol slow and steady is the way. (also speced as a Pally Tank...way better for leveling!)

[1:01:24] johnny90sk: shocadin is nice, but people doesnt like that cause you are not healing as much as holy, and not doing top damage as ret. :D
[1:01:33] bager90: hey hey
[1:02:07] Kaphrpant: there was also a weird build prot for avengers shield and the rest of the points into ret
[1:02:28] CMack_72: someone has to protect the graveyard
[1:02:29] Nightcult: this bg was really bugged the few times I played it
[1:02:30] CryonicBlue: The give up is strong in some teams
[1:02:41] AlexikonTV: @johnny90sk a good shockadin can burn u to 20% health in 2 globals. for dungeons it doesnt matter what u play for healing since they are a joke and shockadin is extremely strong in arena and a lot of fun in bgs
[1:02:50] AlexikonTV: its not about being top in either heal or dmg
[1:02:57] plates_the_hunter: Man I always liked the idea of strand, but I hate strand in reality lol

[1:53:48] Skulligan79: @wingskills Yeah but with that macro you have to actually target the gargoyle first
[1:53:54] plates_the_hunter: so /target Ebon Gargoyle then /cast Turn Evil
[1:54:03] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:54:25] CMack_72: not /cast target.   just /target

[1:54:34] tydresh: fr bums
[1:54:57] tydresh: KEKW
[1:55:22] Wingskills: think theyre saying make it 2 liner, first is /target ebon gargoyle and second is /cast turn evil
[1:55:27] Skulligan79: try /cast [target=Ebon Gargoyle] Turn Evil  -- This only works if your target is the Ebon Gargoyle.  So you would need /tar Ebon Gargoyle first, then /cast Turn Evil
[1:56:26] ClanWestc: @Swifty why not duel witih a dk a test it?
[1:56:32] plates_the_hunter: The one you have now should work

[1:59:47] tSnekk: its flat dmg increase vs lucky +5 oercent crit on heal
[1:59:58] Skulligan79: 5% is only worth it if you stack a bunch of crit, though, right?
[2:00:21] complexified: that glyph is useless cuz sacred already give u 50%
[2:01:01] thespudc1: does the 5% crit add to your 27% or is it 5% of the 27% ?

[3:46:32] splicketylic: Yo not trying to backseat game or anything but keeping sacred shield up is extremely important for tankiness ;)
[3:46:50] SevensealTheRogue: Go Mini Golfing at CityWalk, both courses are a ton of fun.
[3:46:57] SevensealTheRogue: Or Drinking around the world at Epcot
[3:47:23] Ironwelder: lux weakauras are slick, just fyi.
[3:47:27] Extrexo: is sacred shield on gcd? you could probably macro it to other buttons if it isnt
[3:47:37] splicketylic: another little tip as well, is try to time your instant flash heals when your sacred shield is proc'd, 25-50% better chance to crit ^^
[3:48:18] SevensealTheRogue: I'm actually doing Food and Wine tomorrow.

[3:53:34] Rafaeloz: can't you have big icon instead of sound?
[3:53:35] merwinsbeard: could just do it while in combat

[3:55:47] ask_peter: make repeat every like 5 sec
[3:56:02] merwinsbeard: the point is to be annoying so you keep it up... however I would only load in combat so when you are chilling you dint have to keep putting up shield
[3:56:05] Jay_Vee_NL: LUL
[3:56:26] falcor101: make the sound happen only while in combat? Maybe that'll help

[12:23:27] Karenej67: anyone rez Hyper?
[12:23:29] calivarr: 3 tanking is wayyyy easier than 2
[12:23:31] Atlas62: because of beacon?
[12:23:31] Reddikus: anyone not pulling over 3k needs to get kicked
[12:23:39] apsosn: nono it's not the dps

[12:24:36] Brokenarrowz107: dps looks fairly low
[12:24:37] treeshade: use your 3 cooldowns

[12:24:48] AllenzoTV: LOL o god broken gear
[12:25:00] Fightmypala: what healing lokms
[12:25:02] Gelzar: To be fair, dps being low isn't the reason for wipe.
[12:25:04] Rektdone: @bizre doesnt work that way, aggro is based on highest hp
[12:25:11] Gelzar: I think it's lack of knowledge, pve is just knowing what to do really.
[12:25:12] Reddikus: what kinda raid doesnt have repair bots lol
[12:25:39] nificus: ***
[12:25:48] Karenej67: If this was an LFR you can't pick and choose. I have had others in a group kick me because I wasn't geared enough, etc... and I'm like - GEEZ that's why I'm running this Raid - to help get gear... geez! :D
[12:25:49] Spwaffles: I mean it's ez to repair in town and get a lock summon back
[12:25:53] Gelzar: WoW is full of repair bots
[12:26:01] Rektdone: hateful strike is based on HP @Swifty
[12:26:03] schneid4: melee need to step in the green so they dont have high hp
[12:26:08] Reddikus: tell your tanks to use figurine of the colossus from tbc
[12:26:08] bizre: @Reddikus why wouldnt 3 tanks have more hp than the dps?
[12:26:30] Reddikus: Gear
[12:26:41] AllenzoTV: perks of playing on skyfury... never queues, and locked.
[12:26:45] Spwaffles: @hakyun youre right
[12:27:00] thegoonies: we stick our meelee in the green goo at pull
[12:27:08] Gelzar: Really though, this is all part of the raiding experience. It's a breakthrough when you beat him. Keep ya head up
[12:27:09] Reddikus: i wish my pally was 80 id hop in and help lol
[12:27:15] AllenzoTV: There use to be queues
[12:27:17] waruiagueronotori66: 1 raiders from waruiagueronotori66 have joined! 
[12:27:30] Karenej67: Does anyone if Patch is affected/effected by the green goo?
[12:27:30] apsosn: @switfy the melee gets a debuff and has to go into the green water to get rid of the debuff and tank's  tank turn a bit so the back from patchwork  are to the green water should be better
[12:27:38] Gelzar: I recommend the raid leaders to fully explain the fight, if they don't know it look it up.
[12:27:54] Reddikus: what def trinkets are your tanks using???

[12:30:13] au_chilli: It wasn‚Äôt an easy fight early on either, not a huge amount of leet dps at this stage, do need 3 decent tanks and the right buff group
[12:30:19] Reddikus: PALLY
[12:30:24] NoRaidPlesk: show the other 2 tank gear
[12:30:31] SkunkJuice090: @industry_ their warrior tank is very well geared for this early in the game. the problem is healers not using holy light.
[12:30:32] Truth2223: @industry_ One that doesn't die
[12:30:37] Karenej67: @Swifty Are you liking your Paladin?
[12:31:13] Karenej67: @industry_ LUL
[12:31:15] TheBigGigz: I dont think Rock is def capped
[12:31:25] Truth2223: gate
[12:31:33] Hempwarrior420: Nah the problem is massive over healing instead of reactive heals
[12:31:43] Reddikus: yeah i agree that dude might not be def capped getting wrecked
[12:31:50] 009dreamscape: YEAHBUT7TV
[12:32:04] Truth2223: @Hempwarrior420 Hes off on timing imo
[12:32:08] Reddikus: def cap problem then?
[12:32:13] nificus: you have to rotate cds to survive the dmg
[12:32:26] SkunkJuice090: @Reddikus reactive healing is how you wipe on patchwerk for 5 hours alkXD you have to be healing the entire time not waiting for a tank to take damage.
[12:32:29] apsosn: the melees gets a debuff and has to go into the green water to get rid of the debuff // AND RET pally please """DONT USE " Divine Storm !!!
[12:32:33] SkunkJuice090: over healing isnt a factor in wrath, ignore that stat.
[12:32:35] Reddikus: tank prolly tryna parse with dps trinkets on lol
[12:32:37] Spwaffles: When i pala healed this fight... just bacon of light hateful tank and just spam flash of light non-stop... I had to switch fingers cause I was cramping
[12:32:39] Hempwarrior420: You reactive heal by pre cast/canceling
[12:32:51] Hempwarrior420: Dedicated healers tones tank
