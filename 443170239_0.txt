[1:38:00] Royalpowa: Drainerx - is an old school player who has played since before Cataclysm. During his competitive career he has won multiple tournaments hosted by live and private servers (AT) and is widely regarded as one of the best healers in the world. But that did not stop him from performing excellently on dps classes on a tournament level. Overall Drainerx is considered to be a complete player whichever class he plays.
