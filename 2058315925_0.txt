[7:14:18] hommesoja_no_jutsu: KEKW
[7:14:20] kunkkadosed: bro u have issues
[7:14:38] Npok: KEKW
[7:14:42] Telomir: oof
[7:14:43] escapeiztop: rune abilities in general should have way higher base cost, especially if instant
[7:14:43] poofyy91: :D :D
[7:14:48] ashesgg: hahahah
[7:14:51] Aixtion: then reroll ?
[7:14:59] Neverop123: we all play wow we all have issues
[7:15:03] ashesgg: U polish?
[7:15:05] IIIIBEN: rekt
[7:15:18] blomsteryo: porkupine

[7:15:38] Bobzoor: fy fan vad omogen^^
[7:15:45] ilovedogsdog111: ryssjävel
[7:15:48] hommesoja_no_jutsu: locks aint losing to this SP?
[7:15:50] hommesoja_no_jutsu: aint no way
[7:15:51] ashesgg: I am Bulgarian and I understood everything you said
[7:16:08] bodkinz_: battle of the instant casts
[7:16:22] blomsteryo: i am North african and i understood everything you Said
[7:16:32] poofyy91: then u have sp/disc op
[7:16:40] poofyy91: so that makes half classes/specs in sOD :D
[7:16:42] hommesoja_no_jutsu: power surge should be buffed to 30% to make up for all instant spells
[7:17:04] hommesoja_no_jutsu: 20% too low
[7:17:07] hommesoja_no_jutsu: 30% imo
[7:17:17] gdkpgold: because affli is bad spec ouside pvp
[7:17:18] hommesoja_no_jutsu: also flame shock should be 40 yd
[7:17:29] hommesoja_no_jutsu: wtf is that 20yd dot
[7:17:32] Npok: Class balance in SoD is all over the place, makes 0 sense but ppl seems happy with it. I dont get it
[7:17:39] syIIabic: 30% is a walking nuclear bomb
[7:17:44] hommesoja_no_jutsu: imagine if shadow word pain was 20 yd
[7:18:19] pinocchipan: do balance druid need good gear to do good dmg?
[7:19:06] sheepyou1: why no mount
[7:19:23] BRETTYtv: p2 fun so far tho at least imo
[7:19:27] hommesoja_no_jutsu: also why we still have to cast Ghost wolf?
[7:19:31] BRETTYtv: except for stv event being dogshit rn
[7:19:37] pinocchipan: maybe shaman will catch up a little when good gear? wont they scale way better with spell damage than classes with instant spells?
[7:19:42] escapeiztop: initial runes were somehow kinda conservative in terms of power(exceptions ofc), but after some point its all out power burst for everyone
[7:19:47] pinocchipan: with*
[7:20:07] Npok: Did you liked Gnomeregan? Feels unpolishd compare to BFD
[7:20:12] hommesoja_no_jutsu: @pinocchipan dont need to scale more when ppl are already globalling each other
[7:20:53] kneppemanden: @Lmgd1 where did you farm the wind eles in desolace?
[7:21:42] pinocchipan: well if globalling doesnt do enough damage anymore when people have more stamina, and others do more damage with casts , it might flip just a little
[7:22:07] hommesoja_no_jutsu: @pinocchipan they wont
[7:22:17] hommesoja_no_jutsu: offensive scales way harder than defensive in classic era
[7:22:30] ashesgg: complains and then 2-shots the elite mobs :D
[7:23:26] pinocchipan: yes but instants dont scale well with gear compared to other sources of damage
[7:23:28] gdkpgold: jokrdGold
[7:23:35] Npok: YEP
[7:23:46] hommesoja_no_jutsu: and then
[7:23:49] hommesoja_no_jutsu: we just playing TBC
[7:23:51] hommesoja_no_jutsu: KEKW
[7:23:56] Npok: and even 100% hp buff seems low for certains classes
[7:24:15] poofyy91: didnt u said u cant even cast ?:D
[7:24:29] hommesoja_no_jutsu: shaman needs: Instant ghost wolf
[7:24:36] hommesoja_no_jutsu: 40yd flame shock that can crit on dot
[7:24:40] hommesoja_no_jutsu: 30% power surge
[7:25:06] DerDofe1: PogOff
[7:25:06] Yoxdaa: Tbf it's funny how they did handle mob HP increase but didn't think the same DMG would be op in pvp

[7:27:25] GreenLizzardx: and spell reflect ofc
[7:27:25] syIIabic: also ghost wolf should be able to go invis because it's a ghost
