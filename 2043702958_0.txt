[0:28:27] Razzeu: @ReSeT_VT when you shot call if ppl talk about something non relative it fucks the shot caller up
[0:28:59] ReSeT_VT: Ahh i get it, but why was it called air comms, and not just the shot caller saying "clear comms"? Sorry I might ruin the joke
[0:29:15] Razzeu: sounds funny but i get that too, i had a guy once yapping about random shit in a key and made me RageyBoom cause i couldnt focus on my thing
[0:29:18] anaya909: it's like garf.  just let it be what it is
[0:29:26] anaya909: air comms bro
[0:29:33] ReSeT_VT: Ahh i see. I embrace the air comms
[0:29:37] Razzeu: @ReSeT_VT as if empty i guess, like air = nothing
[0:29:38] K4lsdern: garfussy
[0:29:53] Emm_Zee: I assume because "air" is used as "nothing" (like "i used kick on air") so air comms are just nothing comms
[0:29:54] juno_sha: cum coms?
[0:29:59] K4lsdern: HUH
[0:30:04] kondelol: HUH

[1:59:59] dango0n: chat, is it shameful to buy a heroic carry on my rat spriest?
[2:00:00] HarveyPls: ALOO ring ring
[2:01:02] Senen_: @dango0n only shameful thing is buying a boost and then acting like you legit played the content you were boosted
[2:01:19] Esjames458: just watched a dps move away from the orbs on first boss rise, was cool
[2:01:23] HarveyPls: @dango0n if holding your pride means spending a night doing +11s for wyrm crests i dont want my pride
[2:01:25] Aimboater: @dango0n no its the way of the game now man, its just efficient ggs
[2:01:30] dango0n: @dango0n ok cool. already aotc full cleared on main and alt
[2:01:47] c3rby_: dishonor on your family
[2:02:32] dango0n: was going to push my fort keys this week until I found out it was sanguine. I main frost mage... rip
[2:02:37] yeyanow: Dishonor on this chat :(
[2:03:00] Senen_: tbh I know a lot of boosters that buy boost to gear their rats, since some communities do inhouse prices
[2:03:03] deanw0w69: @dango0n its not like arcane or fire are hard spec's Shruge
[2:03:40] c3rby_: Theres a lot of people that struggle with those specs
[2:03:45] dango0n: @dango0n not wrong. my stats are ass for fire tho, dont know how to play arcane
[2:04:10] deanw0w69: @c3rby_ struggling with arcane xdd
[2:04:22] Trishma: does yiesus stream?
[2:04:25] c3rby_: I main arcane, i dont struggle but a lot of people dont want to learn it
[2:04:36] c3rby_: Doesnt make people less for it
[2:04:47] c3rby_: its a lot of memorization compared to reaction of specs
[2:05:00] Surefirexp: uh huh
[2:05:16] Surefirexp: arcane👎
[2:05:18] Senen_: Isn’t arcane a spec mostly built around bursts and mini-bursts? I can see that being annoying in m+, especially if it’s not your main spec.
[2:05:33] griggs929: I love how Dorki doesnt play affix's and makes everyone else do it lol
[2:05:40] dango0n: this is going to sound dumb but arcane legit gives me a headache with all of the purple hues for the spell icons
[2:05:42] deanw0w69: i switched to arcane because fire in keys below 25 is just complete troll
[2:05:59] c3rby_: Yep, ignite just falls off below 25s
[2:06:01] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki

[2:06:53] deanw0w69: i blasted last everbloom boss for like 1.5 million
[2:07:01] yeyanow: Imaging padding on boss, something something I am full single target
[2:07:12] dango0n: flamestrike build also feels like ass for PUGS
[2:07:21] griggs929: welp, Time to make a Spriest is OP and Bookin is out video
[2:07:41] Timexr: fire feels ass below 25 anyways
[2:07:48] dango0n: Spriest smacks this boss with flower pulls
[2:08:03] dango0n: tell the aug to reroll lol
[2:08:06] sleightpvp: sp get buffs?
[2:08:07] c3rby_: not enough stops tho right?

[4:44:16] bug_legacy: @OperationSena Meta is the congruence of optimization. Those specs are considered to be the best because everyone will perform better with them than the next specs (assuming that people are trying to play optimally, which is often the case at the higher levels).
[4:45:15] bug_legacy: @OperationSena the meta shifts when people identify new information that leads to a better optimized solution.
