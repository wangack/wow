[0:54:40] abracka_: i don't think the majority asking for bobby to be kicked out, was because of a bad wow patch lol

[2:58:33] captain_khyzan: hey chat or Towel does anyone know best place to price comic books?

[6:22:06] nekobobo555: morchi...... NotLikeThis
[6:22:26] CoolioDoom: Needs a longer timer to find morchie and maybe something done about those adds too.
[6:22:40] DaBestGAround: i wouldn't say gut it, just spawn traps more often
[6:23:01] bigbrode: fun in theory bad execution
[6:23:06] Vortheus33: you can CC adds
[6:23:08] nekobobo555: adds are too damn fast
[6:23:25] valianya: Can you click the portals on the ends of the beams on previous platform to teleport fast from one end to another?
[6:23:47] Sgt_MorrigahnGaming: What is that Blackhole giveaway?
[6:23:56] Sgt_MorrigahnGaming: Sorry for asking such a noob question
[6:24:04] mavericks312: more traps would kill you faster
[6:24:16] Nerendis: The issue is traping your image does a shit ton of dmg. All 5 at once can kill a dps.
[6:24:56] mavericks312: clones do to much dmg as do the traps when  you break them
[6:25:55] CoolioDoom: yea avoiding those traps looks to be a painin the ass.
[6:26:55] Nerendis: Is the WA called "Morchie RP thing" ?
[6:26:57] baileys243: what addon is that showing the giant model?

[6:39:00] bigbrode: are they tuning any of this tomorrow or is it just the gutpunch to mages?
[6:39:24] Lintgamer: All mages get nerfed
[6:39:27] drhoser: Blizzard hates mage fun
[6:39:31] mrrazputin: mages doing casual 2mil dps in M+
[6:39:37] mavericks312: mages are only getting aoe nerfed thats it only fire is getting single target nerfed
[6:39:44] Murlocz: @towelliee You gonna be playing Cata when it comes out? Or ICC
[6:39:46] Nerendis: It's not a gutpunch at all. It's just 5% nerf because fire is out of control.
[6:39:46] Dreadnautx: I may be late to this party but @Towelliee have you seen the Warcraft Pop-Up Book?
[6:40:05] ruededay60: @ruededay60 thank you for the link!

[6:40:49] ElmSpace: right now in the top keys the comp is mostly fire mage aug evoker and shadow priest.  Their solution is to nerf fire mage to try to get some diversity
[6:40:54] Dreadnautx: Folds out into a map
[6:41:16] valianya: Hunters need buffing still.  If they're making support buff classes now can we get our pet raid buffs back?
[6:41:34] Nerendis: @ElmSpace It's more than that. 75% fire mages are doing more dps that 85% of any other class in Aberrus.
[6:41:36] bigbrode: Only calling it a gutpunch because some of them are up to 8%. Not because it's bad or not
[6:42:18] Nerendis: Still not a gutpunch. It's bringing them back in line.
[6:42:45] SmokedHog: you using the new desk yet
[6:43:05] bigbrode: Used the wrong phrase then

[6:47:02] neverbornlucky: Towelliee chat said this is the time I should try to distract you during it
[6:47:03] Nerendis: Whether by intention or not. This dungeon really requires discord.
[6:47:59] neverbornlucky: Towelliee you  smell nice
[6:48:08] TheRavenGrave: he should have dided a long time ago
[6:48:12] Demitorn: Def by intention. They want these to be almost raidlike. So def need communication.
[6:48:13] Nerendis: You probably want to save lust for P3 to reduce the amount of swirls/sands you get.

[7:40:02] billybaggens: the buff doesnt scale off your gear
[7:40:07] Molvonos: As long as they have the mastery for it, sure.
[7:40:18] billybaggens: so a 390 evoker buffs the same amount as a 430
[7:40:28] Molvonos: @billybaggens That's not true
[7:40:29] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:40:34] Molvonos: It definitely is based on gear and stats.
[7:40:37] bigbrode: lol redditors
[7:40:45] billybaggens: we tested it
[7:40:57] billybaggens: it was within 9%
[7:41:27] Molvonos: Dunno what you tested, my one trinket, when it's in use, makes the buff go from 1700 main stat to 2400 main stat.
[7:41:35] Molvonos: Which is a massive increase in raw damage.
[7:41:45] Molvonos: To say that gear has nothing to do with it is false.
[7:42:08] Nerendis: You got me reading about Henry Hill and the American Italian mafia this whole dungeon. Just realized you are on the last boss.
