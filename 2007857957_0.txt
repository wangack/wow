[0:41:12] Imaril_1: Pageantry is such a lovely word lol
[0:41:16] wolfpackfan10: Was so funny when Soda asked you if you wanted to bid on those shoulders and you said no they are kinda shit. LOL

[0:42:00] QiyeMALL: sodas chat was amused
[0:42:12] Eldartau: it a mace you need to farm from gnomer that gives you 20% haste but has charges. Druids in classic dont benefit from weapon damage except for the speed from pummelers

[0:43:11] Kuretake: leading raids is overwhelming and not fun. Much more entertaining to just do damage.
[0:43:13] RoseSakurako: @CobaltStreak oh I see, I thought you guys talk and determine what works best for the next raid?
[0:43:26] Eldartau: core hounds aint no joke. You pull 1 more and the pack respawns

[3:16:16] GarthorPA: what an arcade
[3:16:21] firewaark: crazy arcade room
[3:16:27] Baikenator: thats why they call hunter x hunter 2011
[3:16:37] drmustachecat: hxh has a 90's version I think
[3:16:45] drmustachecat: Same with JoJo part 3
[3:16:48] muffintop21: Yea they remade hunterxhunter
[3:16:56] picopoker: Are you going to play the vampire survivor's among us DLC?
[3:17:04] DrAtomicPanda: i think i know where this is going

[3:17:36] DrAtomicPanda: i thought youve finished HxH?
[3:17:43] uselessend: the 90s version didn’t go too far into the manga
[3:17:48] rennnnyyyyy: have you watched blue eyed samurai yet?
[3:17:50] Baikenator: fullmetal was a reboot. So they could just follow the manga all the way. Since the first release out paced the manga
[3:17:55] picopoker: Can I say what happened?
[3:17:56] MexZaibatsu: They'll probably just knock out some filler and streamline some episodes the same way they did DBZ Kai
[3:18:16] SummonMaggie: the live action YYH had some good fight scenes but was way too short 😭
[3:18:17] DrAtomicPanda: let me tell you how it ends Keepo
[3:18:22] JumboPreacher: The live action Yu Yu dissapointed
[3:18:35] Gabriolles: It doesn't end @dratomicpanda that's the sad part
[3:19:00] DrAtomicPanda: @Gabriolles he made an ending already just incase he isnt around for it actually
[3:19:05] thedaranth: @jumbopreacher I have no idea what they were expecting with a live action Yu Yu.  Other than the last arc, the bar is too high to screw around with.

[3:21:44] drmustachecat: Greed Island?
[3:21:53] Glacial_: What anime is this?
[3:21:55] Baikenator: i really enjoyed chimera arc
[3:22:02] drmustachecat: York new is great

[3:22:06] PaperbackWritter: KEKW
[3:22:08] MexZaibatsu: dekillSerious
[3:22:10] Zincsaucier93: chimera arc is both the best and worst arc
[3:22:17] Glacial_: Oh word, I started Hunter x hunter for like 4 episodes and have since been on a break lol
