M+ is a 5 man effort, you're unable to correctly tell my skill as a player based off an io score. 2. my current io score, if going based off your flawled logic, is decent enough to assume I'm not a trash player. 3. being a "trash" player is all relevant. I'd like to see your raid progression and i.o score.

As such, converging and reining metas will ALWAYS EXIST. PERFECT BALANCE ISNT POSSIBLE. Please enjoy the MDI competition for what it is - complaining won't do anything. Blizzard is aware and are trying to make MDI better in the future.
