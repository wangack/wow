[3:27:28] Raddius: +
[3:27:43] Penzeera: @rosina_scarlett It's all deferred though. He's only getting 2 million a year throughout the history of the contract so the Dodgers can sign MORE players
[3:27:48] Whippedkreme: Bo would have broken a number of records and even with a shortened career is still a legend for anyone that was able to see him at the time
[3:27:49] Raddius: Oneof the best ad campaigns of all time.
[3:27:50] Coloredtoad: Jim Harbaugh had more rushing yards than Bo
