[0:35:04] OGSceneBoy: CC is what made me mad about PvP tbh
[0:35:05] newkingcody: the game has way too much cc
[0:35:08] OGSceneBoy: So I am excited
[0:35:08] newkingcody: so it needs to be nerfed
[0:35:08] rucamad: Less CC... ? *laughs in destro lock*

[0:35:56] Jaykerh: Cats with down syndrome are not good indoor cats. They sometimes confuse the toaster for a litter box. Best to leave them outside.
[0:36:02] Spart4nm4n: i member warlords as warlords of garrisons.
[0:36:07] Procasually: @Spart4nm4n ooc required I thought?
[0:36:10] Greekology: I remember, that was wild
[0:36:13] kickhem: yo swiftytje
[0:36:32] Spart4nm4n: ooc?
[0:36:36] newkingcody: warlords was when they pruned all the classes and took away half our abilities
[0:36:41] OGSceneBoy: Like Legion?

[0:37:19] Jigslol_: Protttt era + dps
[0:37:19] KodiakJedi: Many classes had CCs made a little longer. A few of the really long CCs were lowered. I think we have to wait and see how it balances out.
[0:37:20] OGSceneBoy: So how would you fix it?
[0:37:24] OGSceneBoy: Keep the amount of CC?
[0:37:28] newkingcody: rated arena is a ghost town

[0:38:31] Broosterz: Arena was fun before they added dampening starting out at like 35%  ....it actually took skill instead of just bursting damage when CDs come off up. Arena used to be about lining up CC with CDs not about bursting damage...
[0:38:41] OGSceneBoy: I didnt even play WoD, but I remember in Legion when I played the most arena matches were pretty damn long.
[0:38:42] ibamoose: As a person that attempted arena , The skill gap is just to much to even learn and the match making needs serious work I was at 400 rating getting put into 1900 lobbies that was not fun
