[1:06:08] xideontv: Lok'tar!!!!
[1:06:14] MagicMooseMoo: Ur invincible
[1:06:25] vocalpenguin: alliance is only better in vanilla. unironically
[1:06:30] abdarahyin: That makes me wonder why you went Alliance after wrath int he first place then.
[1:06:31] Jermo11: i love dave chapelle :D

[1:07:18] angrypoopoo1: this area was always gnarly
[1:07:19] abdarahyin: Ion Hazzikostas doubled down on saying "cross-faction is something I'd never say never on"
[1:07:31] jayplayscorner: you can get mana back from arcane torrent @Towelliee
[1:07:32] Dyriks: lmao
[1:07:35] abdarahyin: I think cross-faction retail PVE is a possibility in the future. Probably only for Mythic + though.
[1:07:44] Arocian: feels like the mob density is a little lower than what I remember
[1:07:45] Broomba: bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir
[1:08:06] xdunpealx: its possible, i mean it seems like every expansion its horde vs. alliance but end up teaming together vs. big bad
[1:08:09] Rayman_1990: @abdarahyin meh, could be quite lulzy tho
[1:08:13] Lecxion: So doesn't Lay on Hands technically cost the most mana

[1:08:48] abdarahyin: most people don't even raid anymore really and they just want to do Mythic + with friends.
[1:09:08] abdarahyin: They can roll Alliance and horde and play with eachother @capcrucnh no doubt lulzy though
[1:09:11] mayloo_original: @Towelliee u think TBC will be a bit more challenging then classic does?
[1:09:18] Marmoh: That knockdown was dramatic haha
[1:09:50] TkingAJ: Towelliee can I see ur gear what does a boost gear look like
[1:09:54] ventu105: hello
[1:09:59] king_waltzy: do you think Alliance will be DOA with BC?
[1:10:11] seanraybrock: 100% all content will be washed in one day
[1:10:15] seanraybrock: one release
[1:10:16] Zeakon92: it will be "harder" then classic for sure, not mad hard but alot more is required
[1:10:22] jeneraljelly: Yeah people will be so geared by the time p5 comes out lol
[1:10:28] VictorAvalanche: can't do all content on release..

[1:10:53] Zeakon92: very true
[1:11:05] pemadsen17: I don't know that that's necessarily true. There was a Chinese Guild back when burning Crusade was current that cleared black temple in tier 4 gear
[1:11:05] xdunpealx: going into a fight you already know what is needed to maximize a win its pretty big this is really just for fun
[1:11:09] Armageddon213: Nice Mavs cap @Towelliee

[1:11:51] Phalamore: *pre-nerf

[1:12:11] maccaruso: I love that we are getting pre-nerf content
[1:12:16] Sh4nti: Pre nerf Vashj? monkaS
[1:12:17] Sniped23: You a luka fan? @towelliee
[1:12:31] Sniped23: Luca*
[1:12:32] kpt58: a few of those pre-nerf heroics were tough
[1:12:40] 3phraim11: so vashj will have like 5 mil instead of 9.5 mil?
[1:12:41] The_Boctor: if you're such a luca fan, then what is his blood type?
[1:12:46] xideontv: imagine joining the trolls your archenemies because one human was mean to you....

[1:22:11] BRUTALIT0PS: You're going the wrong way
[1:22:12] Sniped23: Jokerd hit 60 first on classic right?

[1:23:17] Sniped23: How long do you see beta being out @towelliee
[1:23:30] Zeakon92: asmon had 80-90k viewers tho
[1:23:38] 無職提督: in that case, can i be your friend Kappa
[1:23:39] KingSlayerYotam: no one know it was gonna drop too

[1:24:29] CDubTheRIPper: LUL they aint getting in for years now
[1:24:30] GonoFPS: dude

[1:24:35] CDubTheRIPper: or at least second wave
[1:24:39] Arbszy: They aint getting into any betas now lol
[1:24:46] Garrujak: Well to be fair, every beta in the past 6ish years they've been slaves to streamers. It's really Blizz's fault for catering to them in the first place. People like Pokimane being in the classic beta didn't bring in numbers xD
[1:24:50] Broomba: @Sniped23 and i dont care cause im not some 20 year sperg
[1:24:50] belfastcl: i did seem like all big wow streamers got in though
[1:24:58] Amaki_II: The Lion, the Witch, and the Balls on these guys...
[1:24:58] DocsMistake: I hate that people think that the Beta is for people to just play early and "advertise" the game, the beta is for TESTING to fix the bugs before the full release
[1:25:04] Wulfgrym: blacklist them
[1:25:16] Tequima: How do you feel about the news that Microsoft might be buying Discord?
[1:25:17] Sniped23: @broomba I think ppl older than that watch him too to b fair
[1:25:23] TheRaaj: Anyone remember when Soda didn’t get overwatch invite? I remember

[1:25:34] Phoxzy: permaban there Wow accounts due to harrasment.
[1:25:34] Alegnowar: i wonder who actually flexed about they're viewers LUL
[1:25:35] LeroyEngels: @DocsMistake yea these streamers just wanna cash in on exclusivity thats not what beta is for man LUL
[1:25:48] CDubTheRIPper: ego is way too high
[1:25:48] Mazemouse: @DocsMistake Beta is for testing yes. But also for advertising :P
[1:25:49] Moxgoat: did shroud get in? He was pretty active in classic
[1:25:51] CDubTheRIPper: check it at the door
[1:25:52] Layercake: LUL raw

[1:26:01] 無職提督: okay, that works
[1:26:02] brothafeesh: it seemed like all the actual wow streamers got in, like I saw everybody yesterday
[1:26:05] SonofHorus82: fucking goooood. Those idiots can go suck a tail pipe.

[1:26:39] mr_canabis: @Towelliee will you more focus on TBC classic or/also on shadowlands?

[2:01:08] Shineey: Protection is shiled wall, Divine SHield is bubble

[3:34:32] vocalpenguin: POGGERS
[3:34:32] Jindo_ZG: the faction imbalance is going to be fully realized on pvp servers when everyone is in hellfire at the same time, horde might be denying alliance to even hit max level on some servers

[3:35:06] XshadowturkeyX: hope they add pre nerf kael then see how well guilds deal with that
[3:35:09] peinen: Fake news
[3:35:09] Big_Elum: its a lie
[3:35:14] squirmyjay: Rudolph got signed last week
[3:35:24] Cal_Kat: didn't it also get rid of need of hunter 1 button macro by fixing the auto shot issue?
[3:35:31] discobizkits: i remember doing muru and KJ pre nerf... was horrible... didnt play classic.. but cant wait for tbc again
[3:35:31] Infinitepeeep: @Towelliee im an Eagles fan i think i have you beat
[3:35:32] nosao1615: They might have to, looking really bad for Watson right now
[3:35:38] Eduardlion: Is this oficial alpha?

[3:36:04] darvishayyar: horde paladins ftw man
[3:36:04] Chuckoff21: @towelliee buddy, deshaun Watson is in trouble because women came out and said they were sexually assaulted
[3:36:13] Catspaw66: could be worse and be a browns fan , Yikes LUL
[3:36:13] MabusGaming: I think the zepp is west
[3:36:13] Chuckoff21: By him
[3:36:23] itscraeden: This just beta TBC?
[3:36:27] nosao1615: Browns are actually decent now though
[3:36:32] Lazugo: Wrath babies
[3:36:34] Holysal: @Catspaw66 Browns are good now lol
[3:36:35] pikajazz32: @Farfic I'm with you and Im so sorry at the same time lol.
[3:36:37] FatChase: Thing is though, a lot of players are better now and their PCs aren't running at 10fps in raids
[3:36:45] Vigi9413: is leveling still a long process in tbc?
[3:36:46] MabusGaming: Yeah if I remember zepp is north west of expedition
[3:36:54] crumbler81: Giants fan here, pretty surprised by the moves this year. Usually just waiting for another bad draft KEKW

[3:36:56] alex_mograine: how bad was the lvl 58 gear?
[3:36:57] Essysham: you mean "wrath of the lich king - the ascension of the ret paladin"
[3:37:00] RanLive: It's about time
[3:37:04] Shugaze: were dungeons easy in the beta?
[3:37:20] Biorrwolf: Any news on when actual release is?
[3:37:24] alex_mograine: @Vigi9413 for 60-70 yes but classic content is super fast to lvl
[3:37:24] fattishmattish: imagine not remembering all of these quests
[3:37:35] Sunstepgg: @Vigi9413 its about 30 hours at peak efficiency the entire time from 60-70
[3:37:36] XshadowturkeyX: yes wotlk started to make wow more casual but alot of that didnt start till when icc came out when LFD came out and all the heroics non icc ones got easier
[3:37:37] pikajazz32: @RanLive I didn't know this till I moved here but Im obligated to hate you lol
[3:37:48] RanLive: lol
[3:38:01] Farfic: jump adds dps confirmed
[3:38:02] mysteriousm4n: doesn't conc aura give immunity to spell knockback?
[3:38:06] PeachCanGames: PeachCanGaming subscribed with Prime. 
[3:38:07] Vanhoek: Why arent they testing end game stuff? Like shouldnt they have the leveling stuff fairly polished?
[3:38:08] hiddenalienlol: true
[3:38:15] Essysham: gotta jump - the floor is lava
[3:38:20] alex_mograine: jumping makes you a better player
[3:38:21] Holysal: @RanLive me too. :)
[3:38:23] mrbizhop545: Ran so many alts through hellfire back on the old leveling system I could level there with my eyes closed
[3:38:28] jeneraljelly: @vanhoek none of it polished lol
[3:38:29] Beerrun: jump to dc
[3:38:38] XshadowturkeyX: when they do add wotlk i hope for the first part of it we get dps blood dks and frost tanks and leave LFD till the last phase
[3:38:39] mysteriousm4n: KEKW
[3:38:41] Tarfu: Im glad to see the old sub animation is back
[3:38:42] RanLive: So what do you guys think about the datamining pointing to a deluxe edition?
[3:38:45] Shugaze: covid man
[3:38:52] alex_mograine: its not just the leveling, its the classes, abilities etc. @vanhoek
[3:39:05] mysteriousm4n: there are lists and lists of bugs on wowhead
[3:39:07] Cal_Kat: jump or ur own consecration burts u lol
[3:39:10] Shugaze: I wonder why tbc is such a buggy mess
[3:39:24] Infinitepeeep: cauldren should be by cave
[3:39:28] CptSpock: animations are bugged af
[3:39:36] mutley_pagan: mutley_pagan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! im looking forward to playing tbc as i never played it when it came out, keep up the awesome content
[3:39:41] XshadowturkeyX: they had 2 or 3 open beta testing periods for classic wow i bet they will do the same
[3:39:41] Sepron14: If you just look at blizzards known bug list for BC already youll see its far from polished
[3:39:55] alex_mograine: @HBsumo because its tbc but in retail client, ofc it will have alot of bugs
[3:40:24] Chobgob: I've always admired your longevity - how long is ur longest sub?
[3:40:32] Shugaze: @alex_mograine oh i mean as compared as classic beta, I remember the alpha being messy but not so much beta

[3:41:23] erdls: damn this game is for boomers
[3:41:27] alex_mograine: @HBsumo ah right, i think its probably because tbc has more complicated scripting overall. also we arent really sure how long they worked on classic or tbc before the betas
[3:41:29] Vanhoek: @mysteriousm4n yeah its cause their hit box is huge
[3:41:44] Eduardlion: Saved
[3:41:49] happybooger: ez

[3:44:04] Mitune: getting flash backs to when I was a dumb warrior doing quest in this area. True PTSD

[3:44:47] 2MakeMe: @Towelliee ur not swinging

[3:45:32] Biorrwolf: Any opinions on prodessions? I only got an Ally to 60 in Classic, but plan on going Belf Pally, so I'll essentially be starting fresh
[3:45:34] kokochris: @Kromede I know, its noticeable... danCry
[3:45:38] 2MakeMe: wait what? u get full health and mana?
[3:45:44] Biorrwolf: Professions*
[3:45:45] QuantumDelta: you might find yourself a bit more survivable if you use JoW/SoW and use Consecrate a bit more for your damage I guess
[3:45:49] AkumatsuTV: @Towelliee Gotta Mana Tap to get the mana from Arcane Torrent
[3:45:52] LandoGriffinPHD: towelliee lay on hands you woulda survived there
[3:45:54] Mitune: only issue is that by the time you get back to your body all the mobs have spawned again
[3:45:55] Cakedonut: Lol, the good ole days of incredibly long CDs
[3:45:59] alex_mograine: @HBsumo yeah, week 1 and 2 will for sure be annoying to deal as a 25man roster
[3:46:00] TheSteve: DI best spell
[3:46:06] Huntingbear: @Towelliee Are you downranking Holy Shield at all? It's extremely costly on your mana bar, you should also be swinging with Seal of Wisdom for mana regen.
[3:46:11] Alegnowar: 1Hrs CD LUL
[3:46:18] Frolul: Best change get more health/mana when res up
[3:46:19] Orphanblood: spiritual focus then go to consentration aura big heal without interupt broo

[3:46:52] TheSteve: DI is my irl fantasy
[3:46:52] 2MakeMe: wtf why do u get so much life and mana lol
[3:47:02] alex_mograine: DI was always annoying to deal with for blizzard i bet
[3:47:10] erdls: wc3 ost is too nostalgic it hurts

[3:58:54] Gyhlen: How long do you think 60-70 will take @Towelliee ?
[3:59:04] pikajazz32: @Towelliee How would you compare the feel of this beta to the org relase?

[4:00:16] soysos91: How long does beta usually last @Towelliee ? like in total
[4:00:36] dynari: the xp you get from mobs is wrong atm, getting about 200 less xp per mob than you should be

[4:00:51] Fondre01: but thats reddit
[4:00:57] crossfire_omg: TBC Hype
[4:00:58] remedyt: people are assuming 60-70 was like 1 day i think
[4:00:58] RunningOutOfRAM: I do :)
[4:01:05] Mudflapsd: They've been comparing how much xp people got back in TBC and how much you're getting now, and you're getting significantly less.
[4:01:12] Thoreya: Someone said in monkeynews chat that beta is giving wrong xp numbers
[4:01:16] Mudflapsd: like 20% less

[4:05:13] SonofHorus82: damn they're really going off on metagoblin on reddit.
[4:05:16] Mudflapsd: The mage is chunking him

[4:05:25] pyronn_: Can't you just los the casts
[4:05:33] vikingjason: are they going to invite more people to the beta or is this it?

[4:06:42] Vanhoek: Not having gear is gnarly
[4:06:50] vikingjason: also if tbc beta is here, does that mean they'll be dropping pre-patch to vanilla soon?
[4:07:03] Huntingbear: Metagoblin tries too hard on getting a lot of videos out without doing enough research about them, there's a lot of misinformation in his videos.
[4:07:25] Drogdorf: KEKW
[4:07:41] MrKhanes: he is allways upset with payed services or cosmetic stuff
[4:07:42] Sepron14: I love Asmon but his opinion on optional mounts pisses me off! like it does not effect gameplay at all
[4:07:43] ILikeKillTheZombies: aint asmongold just a fake persona on stream like dr disrespect kinda?
[4:07:44] tebbix: I wonder if he is really mad or it is just content for him
[4:07:46] Chobgob: qqqqqmadseasonswow's video was really informative on boosting
[4:08:04] Thoreya: I get his stances on the mounts. But for the boosts I disagree wit him
[4:08:06] Thoreya: A lot
[4:08:07] NovaSun84: Hey Towelliee can you tell us everything to know about TBC... but like one of our French girls?
[4:08:13] Cranghoul: his enhance shaman guide is entirely wrong
[4:08:14] SonofHorus82: He's only mad because it's not something his mouth-breathers can carry him through.
[4:08:39] Trekxx: thats not why he doesn't want boosts
[4:08:41] Trekxx: but okay lol
[4:08:44] Brezitrex: I definitely don't care :)
[4:08:53] Dizatex: It's just a slippery slope adding in boosts and paid mounts, it will lead to Wow tokens and all the things that makes classic and tbc --> classic and tbc imo
[4:08:55] childish_brandin0: God forbid people actually play the game D:
[4:08:56] mrbizhop545: or madseason making an hourlong video saying boosts bad
[4:08:57] Mudflapsd: Costin knows prot pally really well, so you still had good research
[4:08:59] Ayoojimmy: but it does tho...
[4:09:08] vikingjason: boosts are cancer, retail mentality
[4:09:09] jmasko: Its more about starting fresh and reseting the economy mate
[4:09:09] Ayoojimmy: boosts will promote more botting
[4:09:13] Trekxx: he doesn't want boosts because of the effect it will have on the economy/ how bots are going to abuse the boosting system
[4:09:14] Beerrun: most people dont even want to level at all anymore
[4:09:18] Trekxx: it has nothing to do with leveling at all
[4:09:20] childish_brandin0: The people who are going to buy a boost arent gonna play long term anyway lol
[4:09:21] vikingjason: very very slipperly slope  dizatex
[4:09:21] Jzstyles: botters salivating at the mouth for this boost
[4:09:24] slowsuby: turn around
[4:09:28] slowsuby: oh, there you go
[4:09:31] iam_jackaN: im gonna boost and bot just to proove a point
[4:09:31] Kkr0n1xX: To me, classic isn't vanilla... It's a reforge with modern conveniences added to make it a new, better experience.
[4:09:32] Glozki: the economy willl be screwed regardless of boosts lmao
[4:09:38] Dixietwist: lol but he will dungen spam and get carried throug raids but be "authentic"
[4:09:39] MDF2393: if you are going by back then surely you cant call upon viewers to help as thats not in the true experience as it was..
[4:09:43] gfvaris: so you make 5 accounts and fak up the economy with proffesions
[4:09:44] GameWithStorm: how is no boosts resetting the economy lmao
[4:09:47] Sndhelp: if people wouldnt buy gold there would be no bots. stop buy gold!
[4:09:59] Joocannon: not to mention its not like everyone dropped to level 1 when tbc launched the first time
[4:10:07] Telmorra: There is no proper TBC feeling without hunters botting the ele plateau

[4:10:11] Trekxx: you take the lesser of two evils my dude
[4:10:15] Dizatex: For me the botting is not the argument against boosts, the thing is, where does it end with a level boost? are they just going to remove stuff whenever there is a grind that people doesnt wanna do
[4:10:15] Meyern3: 1 ban out of 200 reports YEP
[4:10:24] Kaihrn: uh oh can of worms opened lmao

[4:10:28] otuell: i played alliance for classic now i want to play horde blood elf paladin is this normal? lol
[4:10:36] GameWithStorm: seems like you're not mad about boosts then. you're mad about what could happen if they did more
[4:10:45] Dizatex: As madseason said, the players should adapt to the game, not the other way around
[4:10:50] gfvaris: pay to play and pay to look good doesnt go well together
[4:10:53] vikingjason: @GameWithStorm sure a couple people will use the boots for its intended reasons but over whelming amount of botters/gold sellers will completely abuse that
[4:10:55] Thanatocracy: People are paying gold to get boosted anyway in Classic LUL
[4:10:55] Gizimoo86: they migh even add boost to vanilla servers
[4:10:56] jmasko: I disagree but that's fine
[4:10:58] Kkr0n1xX: @otuell I re-rolled horde on original tbc release
[4:11:03] MDF2393: its there its happening . lets just game
[4:11:05] flebbooo: yh i feel like it doesn't need to be more complicated than this LUL
[4:11:10] Phoxzy: I like the boost because I don't have time to level to 60 in Classic, but I loved TBC.
[4:11:10] Beerrun: it doesnt even help the bots in shadowlands are insane
[4:11:13] vikingjason: and it's kinda sad that blizzard seems to be fine with that
[4:11:24] madmar1009: thought they required you to have one lvl 60 char to get the boost.
[4:11:24] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:11:28] TheResinger: and for the people that scream about "but then you dont know how to play your class" bro like 6 classes are literally 1 button rotations relax
[4:11:30] GameWithStorm: idk about "a couple of people" using boosts
[4:11:31] madmar1009: did they change that?
[4:11:34] TwitchPlusMe: #NoChanges
[4:11:38] ninedraft317: they should ban ip not the account but blizzard really doesnt care and they like getting that $15 a month
[4:11:41] flebbooo: i understand their pasion, but i care about the whole game/community rather than own wishful thinking
[4:11:45] Dizatex: But do you honestly think they will stop with a boost?
[4:11:50] gfvaris: in before towellie quits after 10 days
[4:11:50] tebbix: Yeah I mean at the end everybody will have their opinion and Blizzard will do whatever they think is ok
[4:11:52] elusiveleopard: TBC Classic should be looked at as it's own entity, with that perspective, a 58 boost is irrelevant. Like starting Classic at level -2
[4:11:52] lejtan1: @Towelliee What Dps class will you play as alt?
[4:11:55] Killsign: @Towelliee I dont have the time to level a classic char, so I am happy with the boost
[4:12:05] keithstonee: wow an actual reasonable take. how refreshing
[4:12:08] BLARGO_: Same people screaming No Changes are okay with Seal of Blood
[4:12:18] Kaihrn: folk that say no changes clearly havent played classic haha
[4:12:20] jontrann: @Towelliee i cannot wait to level a belf paladin during tbc prepatch, any idea when that is?
[4:12:24] dantezalive: what about the 3$ argentina accounts ppl are going to mass buy for botting with the boosts
[4:12:30] CaptainGrodan: Botting can get horrible with the level boost. Bots Will control the whole economy.
[4:12:30] XshadowturkeyX: the only good memeory that anyone should have about bots back in the day was when they spelled suff with dead bodies
[4:12:33] maddhatt3r: yeah but 2 years of bots...
[4:12:36] MrEvilRex: I'm all for no changes when it comes to WOLTK I want my OP DK back
[4:12:43] Cranghoul: fresh servers will change nothing.
[4:12:50] Chobgob: Bots did majorly impact classic even for casuals
[4:13:06] vikingjason: how will fresh servers change nothing?
[4:13:19] Beerrun: i want a fresh server but with a boost it wont really matter so its whatever
[4:13:20] einself111: I don't get it that people are against some fresh servers ... i mean who cares makes some people happy
[4:13:22] NovaSun84: I hate how "bots" are blamed now for everything... even though there are tons of people who literally play the game 24/7 and don't speak english
[4:13:29] Mudflapsd: The pserver people who want fresh are the ppl who quit after 2 months looking for the next fresh.
[4:13:35] mutley_pagan: @Towelliee i wonder in 15 years will there be a Classic Classic wow :P
[4:13:38] dantezalive: Make more bots
[4:13:39] vikingjason: back in orignal tbc they released fresh servers
[4:13:48] spainard15: Tempest Keep will be botted for Neatherweave cloth!
[4:13:55] Ravenward: D: Nooo
[4:13:58] Namragus: Bots gonna get world first 70
[4:13:58] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Hopefully Classic Classic is in like 2 years. We need more progression servers for people that want the authentic experience but came late.
[4:13:59] Girmonstr: I love bots they make everything cheap in the ah.
[4:14:15] Phoxzy: @mutley_pagan Nah, itll be Classic WoW Remastered. :D
[4:14:15] Notsoz: Everyone that say “all the people boosting will quit because of the attunements” - 90% of the people I know boosting are private sever buffed content guys that have played TBC countless times.... just because people didn’t want to play classic, don’t be naive to think that they won’t want to play TBC. Different games.
[4:14:18] gfvaris: so when eventually some bots get banned just let them get 58 ?
[4:14:18] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[4:14:20] vikingjason: and people who go to fresh servers still value Azeroth and the leveling experience
[4:14:29] mutley_pagan: @Phaeten i no lol :)
[4:14:37] vikingjason: people who don't want fresh servers same people who think insta 58 boosts are a good idea
[4:14:43] vikingjason: toxic fast food mentality
[4:14:44] lejtan1: What will the boost cost
[4:14:45] nixter93: stream lagging or me?
[4:14:58] flebbooo: your avarage person isn't gonna pay for more than 1 or 2 accounts anyway to get boosts
[4:15:01] dantezalive: they wont fix it while they make it worse
[4:15:01] Kaihrn: rofl
[4:15:04] NovaSun84: BabyRage but my TBC experience was better than anyone else
[4:15:06] Glozki: @allenh93 good for me try refreshing
[4:15:07] xzBorn: ye probably
[4:15:07] Phalamore: I kinda see both sides of it
[4:15:07] Drogdorf: Token POGGERS
[4:15:08] einself111: yeah wow token works great on retail against bots LULW
[4:15:08] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Yep they need to be more proactive with the bots. Doing a three-time a year mass ban wave isn't enough.
[4:15:09] xzBorn: it wont be cheap
[4:15:15] SteveSD: token and boosts would be real bad for tbc
[4:15:15] Kaihrn: bobbys big token inc
[4:15:23] ContraRob: This is the problem with classic games with no changes, Blizzard has already fixed some of these issues through iteration
[4:15:26] warn1ng: they need gm's on 24/7 with the autority to  insta ban botter imo.
[4:15:31] Sndhelp: i would love a wow token, i have 6.4m retail gold and could exchange it to classic :)
[4:15:32] lejtan1: I think its good that the option for boost is available but it should be expensive
[4:15:37] chexmixz: Not female BELF Sadge :(
[4:15:39] TwitchPlusMe: @allenh93 I got 99 problems but the stream ain't 1
[4:15:40] xzBorn: I wonder how many % of the people who go from no max lever chars to one boost will leave after t5
[4:15:45] flebbooo: LUL
[4:15:57] SonofHorus82: god damn I almost got pulled into the r/classicwow whiney fest. thank god I got away.
[4:15:58] MDF2393: make the money on the bots buying boosts and accounts then ban them haha
[4:15:59] SlowpokeIsAGamer: "Monitoring" means nothing I've learned in the last 16 years.
[4:16:01] Kromede: modern memes Kappa
[4:16:05] Phalamore: WoW token is definetly coming....It takes away a part of the game for me though. Farming is one of the things I like to do, but if there is a WoW token, it takes away my desire to farm gold. You can say that is my fault, but that is just how I feel /shrug
[4:16:08] chrslp: Why havent they been using modern means?
[4:16:09] Alegnowar: if classic andy's don't like it they can go back to they're scuffed private servers that last 6 months and then they get banned
[4:16:10] Beerrun: it doesnt work look at shadowlands
[4:16:12] rzoo: it sucks for people who don't have thousands of gold in classic tbh @Towelliee things like the spellstrike set will be so inflated in gold
[4:16:13] GameWithStorm: boosts literally dont have any affect on anyone outside of bots lol
[4:16:14] SteveSD: other games handle botters just fine but someone this small indie company cant
[4:16:16] RemnantsPast: they make more money off bots than they would lose if they do nothing about them.... they got no insentive to do anything about them.
[4:16:18] SteveSD: makes no sense......
[4:16:26] SteveSD: somehow*
[4:16:28] bigcountry555: NO changes lol JK
[4:16:33] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Token didn't work to stop bots though. It just inflated the market and made bots even more lucrative. Look at the 50 druid herbalism bot chains.
[4:16:34] Ayoojimmy: yeah that wont help either LUL
[4:16:34] vikingjason: No fresh servers, no gold caps = who cares about tokens, gold is going to be worth less then retail by the time WOTLK Classic hits LUL
[4:16:35] Magdelia: why do people cry about the wow token do much?
[4:16:48] tebbix: OMEGALUL
[4:16:49] SteveSD: i mainly want fresh because the economy is gonna be fucked
[4:16:53] Infinitepeeep: im sorry for all these anti token folk, but who said Token were the best solution. you folks dont understand this is lazy patch to deal with it
[4:16:53] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[4:16:55] warn1ng: lololl big tryue
[4:16:55] ContraRob: @SteveSD which games like WoW handle bots well?
[4:16:57] einself111: wow tokens do not help at all against bots ... look at retail ... there are more bots than ever ... it is just another way for blizzard to cash in that is why they don't ban bots
[4:16:58] SteveSD: auctin house is gonna be fucked
[4:17:03] rzoo: @vikingjason the way blizzard let the economy go in classic will ruin the game for people who didn't care about classic in TBC and WOTLK tho.. it sucks
[4:17:03] NovaSun84: it's not fair BabyRage
[4:17:08] Ayoojimmy: Blizz needs an anti bot system like runescape
[4:17:08] spainard15: That is people to give dungeon partners!
[4:17:10] sneaksaway: if your a botter why make a bot for a small game with few players to buy you thing when you can bot on wow and make money from a larger amount of costumers?
[4:17:19] xwalonosx: But @Towelliee shadowlands is just boosting and bots anyways! I dont really think wow token fixed anything
[4:17:24] SteveSD: all the rich people are just gonna up prices for everything and new players wont be able to afford shit
[4:17:26] Shugaze: my friends and fiance will play TBC cus of the boost
[4:17:26] Phoxzy: Modern means: every 20 mins Are you human check? Click all pictures that contain bridges... :D
[4:17:27] madmar1009: point on, blizzard is a for profit company.
[4:17:29] SteveSD: fresh is best for all
[4:17:31] bullymikko: Imo they just like the fresh server start. Everything is honest
[4:17:32] Huntingbear: @Towelliee ...yeah, "no changes andy's" who've played on Private servers that had tons of changes thinking they know what's best for the game ...look how well that turned out for Classic Vanilla.
[4:17:35] Ayoojimmy: seeing all those bots just ruins the immersion and experience overall in my opinion
[4:17:43] QuantumDelta: I've put so much play time into classic wow and I genuinely don't think the boost is an issue (I'm _still_ raid leading naxx :P)
[4:17:48] dynnesty: I rather boost and play the game, just me. Level 1 leveling is boring to me
[4:17:49] RemnantsPast: 2 weeks thats generous
[4:17:49] SteveSD: id accept boosts if they did fresh tbc
[4:17:51] otuell: cant boost a blood elf paladin tho :(
[4:17:53] madmar1009: die hards will play regardless of the lvl boost.
[4:18:02] tebbix: I play retail since MOP and I want to play TBC, I like the boost @Towelliee
[4:18:05] rzoo: they should do something to reset the gold though, the economy is so fked @Towelliee
[4:18:05] QuantumDelta: people just need to chill, lv58 boosts wont effect economy or anything.
[4:18:06] pDLjay: for 50 bucks though :(
[4:18:09] SteveSD: but all these people with gold is gonna ruin the economy
[4:18:09] Baeroz: @Towelliee that same person you were talking about could level during pre patch
[4:18:14] xzBorn: why not allowing a blelf/draenei boost, I dont get that
[4:18:14] Namragus: i agree
[4:18:19] thegame2417: More people is always better
[4:18:20] SlowpokeIsAGamer: The only way to stop the bots is to start banning them more aggressively unfortuanntly. Token or no Token bots will be lucrative. Because there's always a sucker that will buy gold.
[4:18:20] Kaihrn: then classic + poggers
[4:18:20] Cranghoul: @QuantumDelta agreed
[4:18:25] SteveSD: blizz cant even control people buying gold its a joke
[4:18:30] Biorrwolf: Hey, it's their money
[4:18:34] p11l: What are the botters selling?
[4:18:34] chaos31: Im all for that. I work 40 hours a week and have a newborn. I don't have time to level a new toon 1-70
[4:18:39] Teabold: reckon they'll remove the only 1 boost per account restriction at a later date?
[4:18:42] xwalonosx: @xzBorn cause it will be available prepatch
[4:18:43] SpoonManes: 3.41 gigawatts!
[4:18:44] mutley_pagan: @Towelliee for draenei and blood elf what will the xp boost be? 30%?
[4:18:52] SteveSD: they say they track large sums of money and gold buyers, they dont do crap lol
[4:18:55] pemadsen17: @towelliee I think that is the root of the argument that people have against the Boost. It's not a separate game, and shouldn't be treated like one
[4:19:05] SteveSD: if anything they want the extra subs for bots so they just pretend to care
[4:19:10] undead8196: all you need to play tbc is a wow subscription does not sound bad to pay 60 bucks to play the content
[4:19:14] Jeridition: @Towelliee so what do you think will happen when wrath of the linch king comes out... will they make another server for it or will they go over tbc?
[4:19:23] givmeafrekinname: F?
[4:19:35] DegenerateHaven: wotlk pog
[4:19:42] SlowpokeIsAGamer: It should absolutely be treated seperately. And that means not repeating the same mistakes that retail made by having unlimited boosts and nuking the economy with tokens.
[4:19:48] flebbooo: EZ Cash
[4:19:51] Thoreya: I just think trying to replicate something from 14 years ago is impossible and if we have an opportunity to make something a better experience for more people than not, we should do it.
[4:19:53] slowsuby: <-- wrath baby
[4:19:55] codedizle: people complaining about boost is already getting old LUL
[4:19:57] Dylan19_93: wotlk was the most played exp
[4:19:57] Biorrwolf: Let people spend their money how they want. I don't really understand the controversy, since it's on them to spend almost 4 months worth of sub time
[4:19:59] XshadowturkeyX: oh yeah they will
[4:20:00] RemnantsPast: yeah but the "people that wana come back for tbc"  could literally be leveling a character right now in prep for TBC :S
[4:20:00] DieselPowerhouse: wotlk #1
[4:20:03] theoriginalzinng: im totally ok with them making money off old expansions
[4:20:05] spainard15: They are a buisness, they are going to do what they have to do make the most profit
[4:20:07] ILikeKillTheZombies: What if people will get bored with the whole idea of classic by then?
[4:20:08] flebbooo: i have irl friends that would only return to wow for wotlk
[4:20:08] Wildside1177: Didn't it hit 13 mil players during Wrath?
[4:20:08] Threedays_: tbh blizz likes the bots right? bots = more money, they just gotta do "ban waves" for PR
[4:20:09] Swiftytrigger: wrath will probably have a bigger player base than retail
[4:20:09] Krajn: prob :) so many subs they had back in the days
[4:20:10] Biorrwolf: <------ Wrath baby
[4:20:11] Avgvzt: guilty of being a wrath baby
[4:20:11] Kaihrn: timelost proto tiiime
[4:20:14] slowsuby: Wrath is pog
[4:20:16] MrEvilRex: so long as I get my OP DK I do not care what they do
[4:20:16] Razb: i was hoping for fresh tbc start
[4:20:17] p11l: back when we had sub numbers
[4:20:18] MoonZTi: WRATH OF THE LICH FUCK
[4:20:18] progvibe: All my retail buddies want classic wrath
[4:20:19] Overbuilt_Gaming: there should be no boosts.  Just think all Blizzard had to do, was not fuck it up KEKW
[4:20:21] PvtHudson093: i played from vanilla but wrath was my fave expac
[4:20:22] tebbix: Yeah people  that we don't even know played WoW will come back
[4:20:23] codedizle: vanilla baby here
[4:20:24] SonofHorus82: I am 100% all about it.
[4:20:28] NovaSun84: Retail experience: "Cool I got to lvl 60, have 140 ilvl now... holy fuck these people are really mad at me for dungeons or PvP"
[4:20:32] nightfiree: i do think its pretty cool, you get to see kiljadens character changes and now u see him at his origins almost
[4:20:33] vocalpenguin: Grand Crusader, Death's Demise here
[4:20:37] XshadowturkeyX: playing wow since 06 and im most excited for wotlk
[4:20:37] madmar1009: don't even need the lvl boost. they can just roll death knights
[4:20:38] xzBorn: how dare they
[4:20:42] comp1: I'm a wrath baby
[4:20:44] iam_jackaN: im waiting for classic legion and classic cataclysm 4Head
[4:20:47] flebbooo: straight facts Clap
[4:20:48] spainard15: YEP
[4:20:50] Thoreya: Streamers are trying to replicate 2007 so bad. It’s never gonna happen man. It’s just nostalgia
[4:20:51] spainard15: yep
[4:20:52] SteveSD: we need a new mmo badly
[4:20:53] slowsuby: I just wish it was 2008-2010 again. Back when I had less cares in the world
[4:20:53] ZurranderTV: Classic will never be vanilla
[4:20:53] Kaihrn: black proto drake in the bag  and im happy.
[4:20:55] Mortikau: 100%
[4:20:55] p11l: the grind is the experience
[4:20:56] EggwithEdges: I'd love to play Classic expansions with HD char models etc
[4:20:57] Thoreya: We can’t go back lol
[4:20:58] xzBorn: nice strawman
[4:20:59] spainard15: ANd get killed in PVP!!!!
[4:20:59] SteveSD: tbc will be fun, then we need a brand new mmo
[4:21:00] GameWithStorm: asmongold in a nutshell
[4:21:02] mutley_pagan: im just hyped that i can experiance what people were hyped for when the xpacs came out as i only started playing in mop
[4:21:04] Jawis: they just want the game in the same state they "remember" it, just to leave 2 month after, that's all LULW
[4:21:10] vikingjason: @Wolfdefy they have countless dead servers on retail, more than you can count
[4:21:10] hotlocaldadxo: i like ur hat
[4:21:16] Layercake: Classic andys logic: Boosters are bad because destroy all the integrity of the game....ah btw i'm going for a naxx gdkp  LUL
[4:21:19] Shugaze: once tbc is out, classic philosophy is done, people cant cope with that
[4:21:23] dracer30: PREACH TOWELLIEE
[4:21:23] einself111: that is not the same at all LUL
[4:21:25] vikingjason: but they can't spare a few everytime they "progress"
[4:21:25] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:21:28] theoriginalzinng: honestly what will get me to play tbc for sure is if they activate tokens, i dont really want to farm gold for flying lol, im old, a couple hundo on flying doesnt bother me like it did when i was 20
[4:21:28] Dixietwist: towJesus towJesus
[4:21:29] Thoreya: @vikingjason retail also has like quadruple the servers lmao
[4:21:29] Bixster: the only way to get the original TBC experience is to get hit by a bus and have amnesia :)
[4:21:31] Biorrwolf: I'm pumped for Eversong Woods.
[4:21:32] SteveSD: You have to earn the gold for boosting dungeons....... and if you arent earning your gold then its blizzards fault for nopt banning gold buyers / sellers
[4:22:08] Layercake: LUL Selling mara 24/7 gold boosts and gdpk
[4:22:08] Mudflapsd: I know quite a few people who are out there publicly claiming they hate the boost and they buy more gold than Ft. Knox contains.
[4:22:12] MoonZTi: Did this is so unfortunately true bro FUCK
[4:22:13] Phoxzy: Maybe their anger stems from that fact @towelliee, maybe they are upset they won’t be making a gold fortune from dungeon boosts because of the boost.
[4:22:14] Kkr0n1xX: @xXMisfit47Xx I agree, and have said that since its release.  Thinking that you're going to get the real Vanilla experience 16 years later was a foolish expectation, for numerous reasons.
[4:22:16] slowsuby: Pservers are the wild wild west
[4:22:19] SlowpokeIsAGamer: But Towelliee it's fine if IIIIII do it. It's only not fine if someone ELSE gets to profit other than me. venaRee
[4:22:21] dkwarrior4: 1 and half month and tbc will be dead like classic . ithink so
[4:22:25] Saephon: Yeah I won't join a hardcore guild in classic. they've lost their minds
[4:22:27] rzoo: I am more worried about the state of gold than the 58 boost @Towelliee people who didn't care about classic will never be able to afford boes and raid consumables
[4:22:29] SteveSD: @mudflapsd  right, people bitch and then buy gold like morons
[4:22:32] TylerEsquire: Preach!
[4:22:32] Huntingbear: @Pantelijus Really? Classic "no changes" turned out to be a right mess... World buffs, dispelling griefing, realm sizes causing materials for raiding to cost hundreds of gold every single raid. Early leveling in dungeons in raid size groups, no AoE cap causing the leveling boost and gold farm meta (Mages), Fury Warriors and Rogues making up half (if not more) of most 40 man raids because they're OP. ...Yeah, "no changes" turned out real good.
[4:22:32] RemnantsPast: mid max sweaty private server cunts
[4:22:34] p11l: Let me be a noob :(
[4:22:35] TweakT: KEKW Clap
[4:22:35] xwalonosx: @dkwarrior4 nah i dont think so
[4:22:36] codedizle: im to old for all that shit LUL
[4:22:37] Namragus: i dinged my first 60 in classic this week, and i was there at launch
[4:22:38] flebbooo: that's true, i played a bit zandalar tribe a RPPVP realm and people were so nice and just took their time and relaxed
[4:22:41] Desetra: KEKW
[4:22:42] jasperboy: Drama generate clicks and exposure u know
[4:22:47] Zenfar_: @Towelliee I couldn't care if we had a tbc where everyone started at 58 and you could level or buy another 58. Fix the fucking gold botting problem by either nerfing gold acquisition or bot detetion. whatever it takes. its not 2004-2007 anymore
[4:22:49] BLARGO_: the vocal minority is usually the loudest, Pagle has a shit load of mom and pop guilds like you say
[4:22:52] purpgarma: KEKW ranking drama
[4:22:53] SteveSD: if blizzard wasnt complete garbage at  policing their own game id would be fine
[4:22:53] p11l: what about noob friendly guilds
[4:22:53] TweakT: true Yep staysafe did it
[4:22:57] Kaihrn: Scarab Lord shot show was ruff to haha
[4:22:57] Saephon: Clap
[4:23:00] sliizew: rant over? LUL
[4:23:01] Jeridition: @vikingjason I mean like are there going to be different sections for each dlc of servers or they going to put the new dlcs on top of the current classic server for tbc
[4:23:02] Joryckfree: well said man
[4:23:03] ZurranderTV: Preach, King
[4:23:05] NovaSun84: Towelliee vs. Madseason LULW
[4:23:07] flebbooo: TRUE LULW
[4:23:07] SonofHorus82: Wait... so I shouldnt just sit in stormwind and send my army of mouth-breathers go out and grind gold for me??
[4:23:08] Shugaze: I pray that TBC will not be fucked by pserver culture again
[4:23:10] sliizew: nah im kidding, im all with you there
[4:23:13] Deadkeneddy: towBeer
[4:23:14] Mortikau: TRUEEE
[4:23:19] Layercake: Classic andys gives 0 fucks about the game ...it's all their own personal little bubble
[4:23:22] Ayoojimmy: I just dont want Classic and TBC to become retail man. It will be sad to see it follow in the same footsteps and the devs make the same mistakes.

[4:23:30] zulkhanis: no lies here towTinfoil
[4:23:33] iam_jackaN: you sound like asmongold now
[4:23:37] vikingjason: @Wolfdefy there is dead severs in classic that could easily be merged to make space for fresh servers

[4:23:47] D3m0nHunt3r666: @iam_jackaN LUL
[4:23:47] Huntingbear: @Pantelijus Then we can talk about Spellbatching, melee leeway and any number of other things. Keeping things "no changes" made Classic Vanilla WORSE!

[4:23:47] Wall_ass: agreed #somechanges
[4:23:50] slowsuby: paladin seals
[4:23:53] Sorgenkind87: with #somechanges i would have played classic
[4:23:57] MoonZTi: Shit might be hard tbh
[4:23:59] Phoxzy: Streamer vs streamer. Take to the octagon, Joe Rogen might even commentate for free.
[4:24:00] henrikjuncker: im with you, TBC is done, and there is no point in the leveling experience again
[4:24:03] Lopnk: All those streamers/tubers telling us that we are PLAYING WRONG if we don't dungeon grind. how do you play WRONG?
[4:24:06] spainard15: hahahaahahaha
[4:24:06] mutley_pagan: they learned from the classic mistakes @Towelliee
[4:24:08] Cranghoul: LOOOOL
[4:24:10] assman_ny: OG baby
[4:24:10] flebbooo: that's true, they look past alot of thing they handling well with tbc aswell
[4:24:10] ArcaneSyntax: hell yeah #SomeChanges
[4:24:11] SlowpokeIsAGamer: #SomeChanges, but not #AllChanges. And there are definitely people that are pushing #AllChanges with stuff like Auto-LFG, Flex Raiding, Tokens, Dual Spec...
[4:24:13] jasperboy: All they care about is gold handouts and getting boosted for BIS gear on day 1.
[4:24:17] tyrel_jones: 100% with you, let those streamer cry and shit their pants
[4:24:17] Kkr0n1xX: Straight steamrolled classic raids
[4:24:20] bakurathewolf: @towlliee    there acting likeing there 17 LUL
[4:24:20] YotiCoyote: @Towelliee It may only be one boost per account. But botters can make multiple accounts, there's going to be a loooot of botters, more than classic. They already used multiple accounts at once, now it's just a hell of a lot easier since now, instant 58s on every account they make. Idk, just sharing my thoughts. You make good points aswell.
[4:24:22] rzoo: @Towelliee dual spec?
[4:24:27] MoonZTi: Sunwell is gonna be a bit of a bitch
[4:24:30] Gavruta1: true
[4:24:30] CaliSnowman: mmm church up in here.
[4:24:33] madmar1009: Fix botting. happy days.
[4:24:35] verzliasukis: how many bugs did you find?
[4:24:40] Darthyrevan: towJesus towJesus towJesus
[4:24:42] ddubz_: You don’t care because you’re a retail Andy
[4:24:52] Infinitepeeep: no u need to tell how they are wrong
[4:24:53] NovaSun84: Just do a 360 and walk away
[4:24:54] Shugaze: I read posts that people wont be inviting non pvp title characters...
[4:24:55] codedizle: to many people cry over dumb shit imo LUL
[4:24:55] zulkhanis: retail andy LUL
[4:24:58] Chaosruler: Why are people upset about paid changes? It's fine
[4:24:59] vikingjason: yeah its sad to see people who want TBC (and blizzard) for that matter, want to diminish and punish the 1-60 leveling experience. Everyone is going to be 70 in 2 weeks and spamming arena's and the casual players will be leaving in the flocks
[4:25:04] drmabusee: its mostly the private server community who is demanding all of that right?
[4:25:04] Layercake: LUL But but my immersion ..ffs
[4:25:09] Krajn: retail Kappa
[4:25:11] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Race Change is fine. I draw the line at specifically the token because you can't ignore it. Even if you yourself don't use the token, everyone else using it will inflate the economy for you.
[4:25:12] p11l: lend them the hammer
[4:25:12] sainnt757: @Towelliee your streaming room?
[4:25:16] Dr_ShockLoL: @JetjaguarWoW we dont care cause it doesnt really matter lol
[4:25:19] jkitchin75: @JetjaguarWoW hell of a lot better than that classic crap
[4:25:23] Roughneck124: And you started with 25 gold and now you almost have 100
[4:25:26] shale93: I never understood why people complain about stuff that does not affect them its mindblowing
[4:25:31] YotiCoyote: @Towelliee It may only be one boost per account. But botters can make multiple accounts, there's going to be a loooot of botters, more than classic. They already used multiple accounts at once, now it's just a hell of a lot easier since now, instant 58s on every account they make. Idk, just sharing my thoughts. You make good points aswell.
[4:25:32] proprian: @Towelliee Do you think the boosted players will be harassed?
[4:25:35] TweakT: kitchen strum hype
[4:25:39] slowsuby: stream from the toilet
[4:26:03] codedizle: ive been wanting bc forever now i cant wait
[4:26:08] mutley_pagan: you  speak the truth @Towelliee
[4:26:11] Bazsidiver: what about store mounts?
[4:26:12] flebbooo: they have no clue LUL
[4:26:14] sainnt757: @Towelliee you need to give us a before and after of the whole room.
[4:26:14] proprian: @Pantelijus I know they will just want to heat is take on it
[4:26:17] SteveSD: i mean the micro transaction scene is complete garbage, its just been around so long now people ignore it cause unless people stop paying companies wont stop making so much cash shop
[4:26:17] TheResinger: the no changes crowd sure is quiet about the paladin seal addition
[4:26:21] ZurranderTV: Dude Towellie is an OG lol
[4:26:23] Krajn: oye same
[4:26:27] Shugaze: I see classic andys as stolen valor LUL
[4:26:29] Xockel: Guys, how about just having fun playing LUL
[4:26:38] Boxxss: how dare you. how can you play retail Kappa
[4:26:44] Intercoolerz: I have wow characters older than most the people crying
[4:26:45] Dimitrios90: I am a Classic and Retail Andy :)
[4:26:45] Holysal: i play both
[4:26:58] Wildside1177: Raiding in retail is amazing. Anyone who doubts that is nuts.
[4:26:59] Layercake: LUL classic andys don't even know about justin tv
[4:27:00] thiccdaddygamer: tokens are what create the boosting meta that vastly inflates prices on everything for people that dont buy tokens
[4:27:01] pDLjay: @Towelliee my bro is so hyped for TBC but I like Vanilla the best so I will stick to that :) everyone will have their favorite ! diversity is key
[4:27:01] Nevariuss: @Towelliee FINALLY A STREAMER SPEAKS UP!!!! High Five. Some streamers dont realise the average joe dont have 12+ hours a day to play wow
[4:27:02] Roughneck124: I’m a BC baby
[4:27:02] flebbooo: They just mad cause u still care about retail, while they think that people need to be Team A or B to be part of the classic/tbc thing LUL
[4:27:04] codedizle: yeah i was told that yesterday LUL
[4:27:05] assman_ny: Comical at best
[4:27:08] Tr1kk1: started 2005, still playing
[4:27:13] bullymikko: Eveything is either black or white on wow scene
[4:27:14] tebbix: Classic Andys feeling entitled OMEGALUL
[4:27:17] mceslex: if it wasn't for retail classic wouldn't exist
[4:27:17] Dimitrios90: <3
[4:27:26] jasperboy: Can we have classic MOP now please?
[4:27:26] Kkr0n1xX: November '04 Team baby
[4:27:27] einself111: Just give people that don't like it some fresh servers so every 1 is happy ...
[4:27:36] Biorrwolf: But I mean, what about a Hardcore server?
[4:27:39] Roughneck124: I started in 2007
[4:27:41] jkitchin75: classic wod when lol
[4:27:50] assman_ny: I like that idea @jasperboy
[4:27:51] TiredCarcass: i could care less, doesn't effect my enjoyment of the game if some  one gets a boast
[4:27:53] Layercake: I'm not a retail or classic andy ....i'm WOW andy SeemsGood
[4:28:02] mmzy_: I want classic shadowlands already
[4:28:03] Dixietwist: all these classic andys were asking for lunch money from there parents when we were running MC and BT ... sit down kids the adults dont give a f about the services
[4:28:05] Puppette: this is literally the dumbest exchange I've ever heard...some people need to log off the game and get a life
[4:28:15] SonofHorus82: If you dont like the direction the BC is going in then keep your ass in classic, we dont want you to come along and shit on our experience with the bullshit.
[4:28:17] pDLjay: @einself111 I would love it !
[4:28:28] Puppette: and then you'll be fine to play what you want when you can
[4:28:30] einself111: does that matter ?
[4:28:32] Kaihrn: Classic +15,s :D
[4:28:38] tebbix: I'm waiting for classic Legion lol
[4:28:39] remedyt: seasonal server would be kinda weird for wow
[4:28:39] Robmit: I dont get why people complain about the WoW token when all the pservers have paid services as well. Plus gold sellers will exist no matter what
[4:28:45] SteveSD: nah the economy is fucked without fresh
[4:28:48] SteveSD: id roll fresh for sure
[4:28:54] Traxev: I think a lot of you are missing the point that the botters are in this to make money. paying 60 bucks to get a lvl 58 character pushes their time to profitability back and back. Much more effective to bot them up or boost them with dungeons. I am all for boosts and wow tokens all day long. Enable people who can't spend a 10+ hours a day to play. No sense in telling people with families and lifes fuck off nerds only.
[4:29:06] ragehoof24: 90% of the people complaining are just from private servers because they weren't old enough when this was new.

[4:29:45] Kaihrn: i mean if they did classic heroic i would defo play it

[4:30:19] Thoreya: Guys. We can’t make 2007 again. Stop pigeon holing
[4:30:24] maccaruso: Of course, even more so than ever
[4:30:27] Molvonos: @Towelliee All the rose tinted glasses homie.  If you don't look like Elton John on the regular, you aint trying hard enough.
[4:30:33] remedyt: NO LFG
[4:30:34] Gnral: blizz should let the gold for real money be legal
[4:30:40] muhbuhtuh: towJoe
[4:30:41] pDLjay: Ppl boost anyways .. with mages ... Idk

[4:31:03] shimwood: #morechanges
[4:31:04] Beerrun: they will put in lfg right away i bet
[4:31:07] Pufendorf99: quests arent true WoW
[4:31:08] Schmubbs: The #Nochanges community will turn into #changes with LFG
[4:31:10] Venkxx: I mean, where are the people fighting for longer downtime during restarts? :D
[4:31:15] JiberishUI: all these pally spells man - brings back so many memories. BC is where I fell in love with WOW!
[4:31:27] QuantumDelta: when LFG/D went x-realm the whole community thing quickly started fading outta wow I feel..
[4:31:27] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:31:28] remedyt: i want classic but with wrath bosses towRee
[4:31:31] codedizle: @Beerrun of course it was in Wrath lol
[4:31:32] mmzy_: @pantelijus  sounds like we have 1 boizz
[4:31:34] Longlastnamae: ScriptCraft
[4:31:35] ragehoof24: Unless blizzard is going to release every patch with the bugs in the time frames they originally had its not going to be the same lol. Things will always be different but why not get some quality of life changes.
[4:31:43] flebbooo: kekw
[4:31:44] SonofHorus82: I cant wait to see the PVP crowd complain about how fucking OP DKs are. Yeah no shit that's how they were before.
[4:31:46] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:31:48] hectabit: Dungoen finder is awesome tho
[4:31:54] einself111: Lot of toxic people are in all versions of wow tbh ... just look at m+
[4:32:05] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee and the private server people are the ones who fucked up classic, all this efficiency shit is from private servers.
[4:32:18] codedizle: yeah im stoked for BC
[4:32:22] kittiguya: its almost impossible to not find any toxic players in wow
[4:32:27] Stackamo: Stackamo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:32:31] maccaruso: I love the changes and I'm going to love playing BC Classic

[4:32:48] Dylan19_93: @Towelliee  When you do you think they will release tbc classic?
[4:32:50] codedizle: exactly!
[4:32:52] DegenerateHaven: and better servers
[4:32:56] Longlastnamae: 0110001100101
[4:33:00] QuantumDelta: DF and Dual Spec I would be happy to see in TBC or Classic WoW even, but x-realm is devastating for community building :\
[4:33:08] purpgarma: Dual spec would be so good in tbc
[4:33:13] Shugnight: At the min every weekly reset
[4:33:17] Phoxzy: Bring back Metzen so I can listen to him talk about Wow
[4:33:17] RaituTV: Bans on the instant whenever a bot is detected :D
[4:33:18] QuantumDelta: OSRS bans are great :D
[4:33:20] Evertap: In-game GM's
[4:33:20] Nathic69: Blizzard should add LFG and unlimited boosts in TBC , its 2021 not 2007 :D
[4:33:23] jeneraljelly: I would be surprised if they dont have it already, they just dont care
[4:33:28] madmar1009: But even bots make blizzard money - bots still pay monthly fee and game purchases.
[4:33:34] nixter93: whats worse, gold buyers or botters selling gold?
[4:33:36] Ayoojimmy: AMEN
[4:33:36] SteveSD: blizzaard makes money off them
[4:33:37] Bazsidiver: and bann gold sellers
[4:33:38] Thanatocracy: Blizzard have just fired a bunch of people again LUL
[4:33:41] SteveSD: they dont give a fujk
[4:33:43] madmar1009: so if they scare off the bots, they lose money.
[4:33:45] sifer007: Amen brother
[4:33:45] Razb: mavs hat PogChamp
[4:33:46] RemnantsPast: ActiBlizz are to busy firing people and giving their boss a 200k bonus....
[4:33:46] remedyt: hire me all i do is sit ingame anyways KEKW
[4:33:50] misshotmore: Dreamjob - swinging the BANhammer :D
[4:33:50] Goblinemporium: Hire? Instructions unclear, firing more people
[4:33:52] dynnesty: They have plenty of budget
[4:33:52] SteveSD: bobby wants more hookers and cocaine
[4:33:53] zMalloc: Bobby don't get his yacht money if they hire people.
[4:33:55] Layercake: 100%
[4:33:55] dynnesty: To do anything
[4:33:59] kittiguya: wow tokens, gross.
[4:34:02] Durnikk: Fuck Ill be an IN game GM FOR FREE to get rid of shitheads @Towelliee
[4:34:05] QuantumDelta: I think some blizz devs care about their management doesn't give a crap ;\
[4:34:11] AlaskanStrat: Blizz tops dont want to dip into their 20 million $ bonuses though :(
[4:34:12] Longlastnamae: Gotta dump all that gold somewhere
[4:34:15] maccaruso: They don't care about the scammers and the bots.  They care about share price and proit level
[4:34:18] ragehoof24: Boosts, Dual Spec and ban the bots to control the toxic behavior it brings. GG TBC would be fine with that alone.
[4:34:21] Phoxzy: Bobby's bonus was stock, so if they make it better he makes even more money.
[4:34:22] dcmaniac11: !uptime
[4:34:22] jasperboy: Oh well, back to Stone Legion progress
[4:34:25] jasperboy: later chat
[4:34:26] SteveSD: tokens dont do anything, its jsut them selling gold instead of gold sellers
[4:34:28] eatonaround: can you boost a character you've made already or is it just fresh toons?
[4:34:28] kittiguya: I finally get a horde charatcer with this boost they giving us :D
[4:34:28] SteveSD: lmao
[4:34:29] Sndhelp: i hope it comes!
[4:34:32] Molvonos: I'm boosting in BC.
[4:34:36] PhillyDilly18: What character you use the boost on is the true “meaningful choice” of WoW
[4:34:39] mmzy_: I want fresh servers :(
[4:34:48] ArcaneSyntax: token might actual kill most of the bots.
[4:34:51] codedizle: boost, tokens all that shit doesnt bother me i could careless LUL
[4:34:54] Antdavs24: When are we getting the boost
[4:34:57] Leavaris: they clarified that already, its new and exsisting
[4:35:00] madmar1009: Morals and business practices don't always align... Blizzard has always leaned towards the business aspect of things.
[4:35:06] Traxev: @Towelliee Curious to you, very specifically what does wow tokens affect?
[4:35:14] lejtan1: Is it known if the boost will also lvl proffesions like its in retail?
[4:35:16] ArcaneSyntax: also bots used to be way worse back in tbc and wrath.
[4:35:21] Longlastnamae: Link Achievement or gtfo of group
[4:35:27] spainard15: No boosting Blood Elf Pally and Dranai SHaman
[4:35:27] Longlastnamae: Can't wait for that
[4:35:43] madmar1009: wow tokens allow blizzard to passively 'sell gold' to the community.
[4:35:44] t0pgun_: true
[4:35:48] codedizle: very true
[4:35:54] madmar1009: guy buys token, used token to get gold.
[4:35:56] tebbix: 5Head
[4:35:56] Layercake: And that's makes sense
[4:36:00] MVRD: i wont give them a second chance for shadowlands
[4:36:01] 210Crawler: Ello mates
[4:36:02] assman_ny: Always a bottom line
[4:36:07] gettzybb: wow tokens in bc confirmed?
[4:36:11] mattoxi: Asmongold and the no changes bullshit trio gameplay in tbc at lvl 70: - waiting for invite/summon and accepting gold/gear/mats from trade window 4Head
[4:36:12] Shugaze: my fiance will play tbc because of that and she only plays retail
[4:36:15] Traxev: but people getting gold, how does that affect you?
[4:36:16] GhostFace_23: Towel speaking actual truths instead of ranting about mounts
[4:36:17] Regga: that's a good point... i just resubbed to level in Classic
[4:36:24] RemnantsPast: thats worse than Draenor
[4:36:35] Gnral: shadow lands is well made , good for devs but the story line is pure bullshit
[4:36:36] Traxev: You can still go play with friends, you can still make new friends, you can still arena.
[4:36:39] Layercake: Classic andys are fuming LUL
[4:36:41] OnlineAthlete2: @Towelliee Belluar said the 41% drop is consistent with every other expansion
[4:36:45] madmar1009: asmon is a very toxic person. I watched him once and left because he treated his guildmates so bad.
[4:36:49] benicillinn: i thought classic wow was made to get away from retail mechanics like paid boosts and transfers and faction changes though. doesnt that defeat the purpose kind of?
[4:36:52] obelisk1151: @Regga im gonna wait till pre patch so they will boost lvling
[4:37:08] Layercake: LUL me neither
[4:37:12] codedizle: @madmar1009 i stay away from that channel LUL
[4:37:24] Biorrwolf: Tin Foil hat theory: The money from Legacy servers are really to stage a mutiny from Activision
[4:37:33] Dylan19_93: What speed is the deluxe mount gonna be? cuz it does save some gold i guess
[4:37:35] Hitchhiker422: @Towelliee are you all for having TBC in the hardest balanced state?
[4:37:41] flebbooo: same
[4:37:49] Molvonos: @Biorrwolf What?  towDerp
[4:37:50] LilGarlicSauce: !TBC

[4:37:50] Farfic: ohh I totally forgot about the pvp thing in Hellfire
[4:37:54] kittiguya: @Towelliee I wish A LOT of people felt the same way, thats why im looking forward to it
[4:37:57] QuantumDelta: it's the community stuff that makes or breaks it for me
[4:37:59] Shugaze: I was expecting naxx players cry about blue drops replacing their epics, but this is next level
[4:38:01] Mudflapsd: @benicillinn Classic is to bring back community. Store mounts etc dont really effect it. We n dont want cross server realms and grouping with players from servers who we will never see again.
[4:38:14] gettzybb: doesnt wow tokens affect all? like prices might go up becuase people just buy tokens?
[4:38:26] QuantumDelta: dungeon finder makes your dungeon mates effectively expendable NPCs though
[4:38:34] branninjackson: i dont understand, you still have to level through the "new content". Also boosting a class doesnt make you good or give you BiS gear. You still have the grind just like other people, you just didnt play through classic content
[4:38:34] Nessman6: how is the beta @Towelliee
[4:38:41] remedyt: if they added buffs or xp to the cash shop thats when it should become an issue not just an animation
[4:38:45] Traxev: PREECH it towelliee!
[4:38:45] Dimitrios90: TRUE LUL
[4:38:50] Dr_ShockLoL: thats the world now. ppl worry too much about others when they are shit themselves lol
[4:38:51] Molvonos: @QuantumDelta And they weren't before?  You're asking for social aspects that don't exist or never ceased existing.
[4:39:01] Mitune: if they would pay well Id hunt bots all day
[4:39:07] madmar1009: We do good, we kill NAGA scum!
[4:39:12] Traxev: 100% agree focus on what makes the game fun for you and not worry about all the other BullS***
[4:39:19] olaufh25: that mavs hat tho, hawt
[4:39:19] einself111: why would they counter bots ? if they can justify the wow token with bots ..... they give a shit about the quality
[4:39:19] brian99000: It's ran by a different company if I recall
[4:39:22] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:39:29] Kromede: china FortOne
[4:39:30] Xockel: LUL
[4:39:31] subversv: gundam LOL
[4:39:36] remedyt: KEKW gundam
[4:39:42] flebbooo: go full shameless mode on CH servers LUL
[4:39:42] DakotaPelana: MAVERICKS BABY! you a fan? @Towelliee
[4:39:47] Hitchhiker422: it would bother me to have faction change in TBC b/c i want to have a heathy ally population.
[4:39:53] Apokolipz: AYAYABASS
[4:39:55] Biorrwolf: Towelliee gets canceled for calling them Gundam Lol
[4:39:56] Shugaze: chinese players can like gundams too
[4:39:57] Mudflapsd: Recruit a Freind was that, and it was in TBC
[4:40:01] Clay2K_: @Towelliee I'm watching Zeta Gundam again now
[4:40:02] Mitune: Gundam love is universal
[4:40:06] happybooger: i love Gundam also
[4:40:13] happybooger: we need a Gundam mmo
[4:40:21] Gravenxv: Gundam IBO
[4:40:22] Layercake: Kappa Preach paid
[4:40:30] Shugaze: yes?
[4:40:37] QuantumDelta: no recruit a friend in BC vanilla
[4:40:38] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:40:38] chrslp: It started in BC right?
[4:40:40] slowsuby: it was the wotlk prepatch I think
[4:40:42] Shamwise: Most Powerful in all of Outlands.....you jest
[4:40:45] slowsuby: so end of BC
[4:40:45] MadBomberXX: unkown yet
[4:40:46] QuantumDelta: yeah it was WOTLK Prepatch
[4:40:47] Krajn: 64 lvl cap
[4:40:50] Mitune: Swift Zherva needs a come back
[4:40:56] Xuri_Isoril: recruit a friend started in tbc, but the exp boost was a wrath thing
[4:40:56] Shugaze: was it?
[4:40:57] Wildside1177: Hey Toweliee do you remember Epoch Hunter? Dropps so much good gear.
[4:41:00] Rippan: yeah I think it was at the end of BC
[4:41:08] Mudflapsd: It was in BC and it was WAY MORE powerful than a boost
[4:41:08] Gnral: bfa was better than wod and sl .. no joke
[4:41:23] Biorrwolf: @pantelijus You can still accrue high level gear while leveling, as opposed to getting stuck with mediocre stock gear from a boost
[4:41:26] RemnantsPast: extra range to hit things based on your race
[4:41:42] Bazsidiver: its gonna be a shit show
[4:41:44] Donny_TBC: They had it back in vanilla where the lag would allow them to hit bigger targets.
[4:41:44] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:41:48] pk99: leeway reeeeee
[4:42:03] kitzikat: Play the video
[4:42:07] Gerry_boE: no
[4:42:09] Zivs: two taurens hit eachother thru pillars for example
[4:42:12] MVRD: watch the video
[4:42:18] Gerry_boE: leeway gives like extra range on meele attacks
[4:42:23] MadBomberXX: input delay?
[4:42:27] Hitchhiker422: no it lets melee hit at longer range b/c of ping
[4:42:28] flebbooo: LULW
[4:42:35] Biorrwolf: @pantelijus An xp boost doesn't stop you from ALSO benefiting from the grind, unlike a boost would
[4:42:39] Mecabeast: taurens can melee without being hit back
[4:42:49] Grissick: @Towelliee Melee leeway was something blizzard put into the game...it increases your atk range on melee attacks while moving to account for server latency
[4:42:51] pbnj_kills: the other video i think is crazier
[4:42:54] slowsuby: I think this is more demonstrating the large hitbox of tauren males
[4:42:55] Fondre01: it is the rule that if both chars are moving the melee range expands
[4:43:02] RemnantsPast: standardizing hit range regardless of race
[4:43:02] Mitune: I think less people had the latency issues
[4:43:04] slowsuby: lowered tauren male hitboxes
[4:43:05] Fondre01: this is made worse by tauren's larger hit box
[4:43:08] Lopnk: they made everyone's hitbox the same size
[4:43:12] Lopnk: was the fix
[4:43:13] flebbooo: true LUL
[4:43:13] purpgarma: Latency fixed it and hitbox changes
[4:43:27] Triist0ne: NICE
[4:43:28] Kromede: POGGERS
[4:43:31] Triist0ne: POGGERS
[4:43:45] D3m0nHunt3r666: Tow get that Alpha for Diablo PogChamp
[4:43:58] Zivs: didn't they say that at blizzcon, they would use the SL version of LFG
[4:44:01] Hitchhiker422: well they put melee leeway in for classic to emulate poop internet from back in the day. Its more or less keeping in in for TBC.
[4:44:04] RemnantsPast: It's the M+ Group finder
[4:44:11] Vexxsis: we had a lfg but not a dungeon finder
[4:44:21] MVRD: dungeon finder, rip LULW
[4:44:22] slowsuby: They are adding the group finder (not auto dungeon finder) from retail into TBC
[4:44:36] einself111: yeah that is fine
[4:44:36] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[4:44:45] Vexxsis: oh that's cool
[4:44:47] Rippan: make sense
[4:44:48] flebbooo: Probably just a modern version of the 2007 group finder
[4:44:49] Thoreya: That is absolutely fine with me
[4:44:52] slowsuby: This group finder thing in TBC is going to be awesome
[4:44:54] NOHITJEROME: hello towelliee good sir
[4:45:01] Kaihrn: gona be full of boost groups again haha
