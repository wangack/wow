[0:25:51] kegness: not sure if youll get progress
[0:25:56] Mioshi: @jakenbakeLIVE the great vault is a build up reward system. u have to meet a certain criteria per reward rank. you build it up by killing raid bosses, mythic + bosses, and doing certain amount of PVP, though u dont have to do all 3
[0:25:56] RedHotss: its actually really easy to get to
[0:26:13] CaptainSaijan: love to see so many new frogs! mioshi1Love
[0:26:25] RedHotss: do you have a good link for it @Mioshi_
[0:26:28] dium: you don't get credit in a raid homie
[0:26:30] Mioshi: @jakenbakeLIVE for example: u can reach the greatest vault reward criteria just by doing 10 mythic+ runs
[0:26:31] dium: remember
[0:26:46] Reckless_Monk: in a raid you dont

[1:19:04] QuinnTheAlbino: ASLONG AS UR IMPROVING :d
[1:19:17] Nerot1x: @jakenbakeLIVE what really helps to improve focus on dps is a good weakaura, so you dont have to eye away from the middle of your screen.
[1:19:17] Theevun: Wait top 3 were all melee on that boss?
[1:19:29] JayReynard: "Not the most friendly for melee," but almost all of top dps was melee. Kappa
[1:19:32] Nerot1x: weakaura, with CP's and important cd's etc.
[1:19:39] Frozenwind92: there whole raid is almost melee
[1:19:42] Frozenwind92: their*

[1:21:16] nazu44: Yeah i was talking about all the friendly hp bars above the char's
[1:21:18] Frozenwind92: @jakenbakeLIVE also the bars above the heads of ppl that one clutters it the most
[1:21:40] GreenyScott: it was such a QoL improvement for me when i setup my weakauras and got rid of a lot of clutter on my screen
[1:21:42] Nerot1x: Any mod can grant me right for linking something?
[1:21:42] JayReynard: Yeah, as DPS only show enemy health bars. Either ctr+v opr shift+v
[1:21:44] Frozenwind92: isnt that an addon?

[3:15:58] bubbygold: Sword Art Online
[3:16:28] PolygonStatic: Yeah possibly, but it would be so far away from what the game is right now i would think
