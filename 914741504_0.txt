[1:22:45] PotbellyGoat: it was fun seeing Valheim
[1:22:51] MidNightBlur57: which surprises me cause I think shadowlands is so fun
[1:22:53] DrakhanGaming: Everyones just waitin for next raid, nothin new to really watch on wow channel
[1:22:53] silverknight16: Wasn't that the way as soon as SL released, too?
[1:22:56] NewWorldReign: Isnt Hades another big thing to stream on?
[1:22:58] dr1v3n21: I don’t find watching any wow content particularly enjoyable at all, but I find some streamers entertaining

[1:23:46] AcidAbyss: but its good
[1:23:48] AcidAbyss: ride the wave
[1:23:54] CDubTheRIPper: i was super hype about shadowlands. i remember we were putting SL above legion before we even played a week of SL lol
[1:24:07] MidNightBlur57: is there something bad about shadowlands that I'm missing? this is the longest I've been invested into an expansion
[1:24:12] TJCool: the new mario game was pretty cool was watching it earlier
[1:24:24] icemanj99: What did you think of Valheim? Didn't get to see your stream this morning.
[1:24:28] TJCool: if you care anything about mario
[1:24:31] AcidAbyss: Yeah its good to be comfortable
[1:24:39] NewWorldReign: its not new, it was made like 7 years ago on Wii U
[1:24:40] Zavier420: @Towelliee But you'll still have WoW expansion marathons right?

[1:25:21] Velashen: @NewWorldReign Well no one purchased Wii U so it is new to most ;)
[1:25:25] DrakhanGaming: is valheim a sponsored game?
[1:25:32] Alastree: I don't think the stream view numbers are indicative of how many people are enjoying SL. How much PvE can someone watch? Viewers are most likely players as well and have their own runs.
[1:25:38] nihilistic_bat: @CDubTheRIPper I'm not at all, but Valheim is fun because it's not one of them.
[1:25:57] NewWorldReign: @Velashen Lol, true.
[1:26:18] CDubTheRIPper: @Alastree thats true, and not all WoW players watch twitch

[1:27:21] TheEnstraynomic: would it be a disappointment if classic TBC turns out to be faceroll, and not stuff like pre-nerf kael'thas?
[1:27:33] yshtola1337: @Towelliee do you think they will do wrath classic too
[1:27:39] silverknight16: Hey, if Blizz asks, it's just speculation, right?
[1:27:51] MidNightBlur57: how many expansions before classic stops being classic?
[1:28:02] Noshpan: I would've said "It's inevitability"
[1:28:14] Zyvuun: Wrath Classic. Ok, NOW you have my attention.
[1:28:30] D3m0nHunt3r666: Wonder if they will do Cata
[1:28:42] D3m0nHunt3r666: Or just skip the bad expansions xd
[1:28:46] TJCool: seems like guilds always seem amazing in theory and then end up falling apart
[1:28:56] Alastree: RIP WildStar
[1:28:59] Othala254: I mean, wildstar kind of killed itself
[1:29:17] Zyvuun: I actually liked Cata. Tauren Paladins made my day back then.
[1:29:30] MidNightBlur57: will you be playing ashes of creation ??
[1:29:33] showmethesugar35: How come you did not like classic?

[2:53:43] Bullviine: its subjective Towelliee, regarding the name, to me them being called One Tru King has no reflection on how I view them if they win or lose
[2:53:45] Bullviine: its jsut a name
[2:53:55] c4mmweir: I put out good vibes tonight for you to get the love rocket mount 😞😞
[2:54:45] PrimogenitureJ: One true king sounds like a religious reference to me tbh
[2:55:14] Lazugo: are you gonna buy the black plate for the PS5?
[2:55:17] Scusio: also sometimes it represents nothing and its just a name
[2:55:20] Bullviine: I dont see the name One True King as aggressive, to me it does not scream we are the best resepct us. Its actions that speak louder then words. I get you though bro, to you its a little different as you know those people in the org so you view them in a different light so you have high expectations of them
[2:55:51] huntersneedabuff: I mean their name might be one true king but they don’t tbag after every win like c9
[2:55:53] c4mmweir: Don’t know if you drunk whiskey, but if you do , do you have a fav? If not what’s your fav red wine???
