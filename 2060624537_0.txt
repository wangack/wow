[6:06:39] laiskayo: with summons dont take that long
[6:06:55] Happylat: alone 2 hours run
[6:07:05] pbj_time: barrens -> westfall -> stone talon -> loch modan -> hillsbrad... i think thats the location steps
[6:07:09] stickywoods: you have to run to west fall
[6:07:22] SnotBoogey: @Happylat id say as hord emage youc an get it much faster than that
[6:07:33] SnotBoogey: with ports to undercity and base close in stonetalon
[6:07:36] SuaSponte: like a grenade
[6:08:23] Happylat: @SnotBoogey  I guess your right depends if you have the FP's and know where to go :D
[6:08:24] LuxzGaming: Nice song
[6:08:24] xanin92: yo big z may you show your talents for aoe?
[6:08:44] Smokin_haze: SeemsGood
[6:08:48] Carcer69: But its not 60 min cd
[6:09:00] hobbehesu: Madgeneto MORE POWER
[6:09:00] Carcer69: so its actually lay on fingers
[6:09:30] SnotBoogey: lay on knuckle
[6:09:43] Oreox23: Just got done with the 25-40 instance grind as an arcane mage, thank god
[6:10:19] larsryd1: hunter compared to mage what to play...
[6:10:23] mrciannu: yes but i didnt see the lay on hand shit KEKZ
[6:10:28] mealtiime: ofc, if it is anyrhing related to mage it gets nerfed
[6:10:30] mrciannu: wont make more of those predictions
[6:10:32] Noh_Wei: They will nerf the mage heal before they nerf boomies or SPs
[6:10:38] SnotBoogey: i feel liek its bugged and gives the max amount always. while youre supposed to charge it with damage first
[6:10:44] Frahtherack: It's always a vibe in this stream DinoDance
[6:10:45] mrciannu: u can t die unless u trolling
[6:10:55] mrciannu: or unless ally attacks u
[6:10:59] Oreox23: Anywhere between 20-50k an hr, I was pugging it with randoms :(
[6:11:02] pbj_time: idk if they nerf the dmg they gotta let it apply temp beacon or something
[6:11:26] SnotBoogey: yeah i think youre right actually
[6:11:30] feardotrun: ziqo always got the best jamz fr tho
[6:11:36] SnotBoogey: 7999 + spellpower seems right
[6:11:44] SnotBoogey: no it consumes it
[6:11:48] pbj_time: no..
[6:11:59] dramajohns: @SnotBoogey it doesnt consumme
[6:12:11] SnotBoogey: it does not?
[6:12:16] SnotBoogey: thoguth it did
[6:12:21] Inzio: SM can be fast if your group doesnt suck but the avg w0w player is pretty shit lol
[6:12:29] SnotBoogey: but yeah gotta haev it on for when you take the damage you wanan heal
[6:12:37] manny_geee: I love this beat so much
[6:12:41] evensenjajaja: aaaaaah @Ziqoftw ! you're the reason I woke up today my man! ure the goat
[6:12:44] Carcer69: And is not dispellable
[6:12:51] SnotBoogey: xD
[6:12:53] SuaSponte: haha
[6:12:57] mrciannu: can u pom it ?
[6:13:16] mrciannu: presence of mind
[6:13:17] SnotBoogey: @mrciannu i havent tested but i dont see why not
[6:13:45] Diabolikkgg: is this on living flame eu ?
[6:14:03] mrciannu: @Diabolikkgg crusader strike na
[6:14:39] Diabolikkgg: whats the mage tech
[6:15:06] Diabolikkgg: how to compete with spriests and boomies
[6:15:45] Elensar748: is arathi not open yet?
[6:15:46] moosywow: but boomies are playing 3min mage every 6 seconds
[6:16:08] celestius11: Isn't that just Netflix sorc from d4 all over again lol
[6:16:13] SnotBoogey: @Diabolikkgg icy veins + chrono pres + living flame + livng bomb and spam slows
[6:16:53] stickywoods: george clinton
[6:16:54] Diabolikkgg: @SnotBoogey dam i just want ice lance to get buffed
[6:17:01] deenox: Man I just did 820 starsurge at lvl 35 on a 37 hunter
[6:17:01] hobbehesu: Snarelord
[6:17:17] Diabolikkgg: you here for a season or  a reason xd
[6:17:25] Oreox23: I dunno the boomie didn't dominate so much after the 1350 arcane surge
[6:17:25] SnotBoogey: @Diabolikkgg yeah i dont think ice lance is the play currently. but i still play froist with those runes
[6:17:25] Shady_Love: are you on NA servers?
[6:17:34] SuaSponte: if you get ganked can you icy veins, pom, portal?
[6:17:38] hobbehesu: You're running the Fish Oil market now i bet
[6:17:39] SnotBoogey: @Diabolikkgg for longer slows and survivability and to snap icy veins
[6:17:59] Diabolikkgg: think ill just play my priest
[6:18:05] Shady_Love: what's the chance you ca nboost me in deadmines LUL
[6:18:10] dramajohns: and does bomkin has 200% crit dmg ? is that new ?
[6:18:11] SnotBoogey: fotm mindset
[6:18:27] larspett2: Is mount at 40
[6:18:37] SnotBoogey: ye^
[6:19:00] Diabolikkgg: xDDDDD
[6:19:00] hobbehesu: He wants to be Hydra
[6:19:23] SuaSponte: just feels like 200%
[6:19:23] Diabolikkgg: imagine having to play a mage healer to stay alive xd
[6:19:26] SuaSponte: when you get hit
[6:19:28] SnotBoogey: idk what boomkins have but theyre boringly OP
[6:19:33] SnotBoogey: ruin every fight
[6:19:50] Diabolikkgg: MUD WIZARD
[6:19:52] Diabolikkgg: icant
[6:19:56] richard_head27: yea just saw a boomkin splat xaryu in seconds =(
[6:19:56] SnotBoogey: good name lol
[6:20:03] SuaSponte: just give starsurge a cast time and they set
[6:20:19] hiro25000: Boomkin and shadow priest do ridiculous damage
[6:20:21] richard_head27: he starsurged 750 750 back to back
[6:20:36] dramajohns: in the combat log their surge deal double dng in crit. I htought only frost mage has 200% crit dmg
[6:20:37] crownhs: 1.5sec cast time on starsurge would be balanced
[6:20:40] hiro25000: I got hit for 1k1 by a mind blast
[6:20:40] Inzio: theyre def hotfixing boomy soon
[6:20:43] subbyye: What does the chrono thing do ?
[6:20:46] Inzio: really no point in lvling one at this point
[6:21:01] SnotBoogey: that or give it longer cd.  right now its like they have lvl 80 fireblast lol
[6:21:22] Viccili: boomies wraths crit fpr 700 on 1 sec casts
[6:21:24] pbj_time: On wow head they made the buff you get from chrono pres make you do 50% less damage as fire/frost, but I dont think they implemented that
[6:21:32] richard_head27: 750 was a lvl 32 druid
[6:21:40] faceroll52: Xaryu is 32 tho
[6:21:45] deebizness_: locks get 200 as well
[6:21:46] Alfasir: Alfasir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[6:22:18] SuaSponte: frostbolts crit pretty hard with spell power
[6:22:21] dramajohns: it becasue he hit me with 2 surges. the first was 400 smt and second was 900 smt
[6:22:25] SuaSponte: rune
[6:22:26] hobbehesu: Man inventing new keybinds gonna suck ass at 60, rip 15 year old muscle memory
[6:22:47] SnotBoogey: ii think regen + brain freeze+ spellfrost bolt looks interesting too
[6:22:48] SuaSponte: 750 or so at lvl 38
[6:23:01] Emistry1: pyro in pvp 1k dps
[6:23:05] Emistry1: crit
[6:23:27] SnotBoogey: @Ziqoftw  yes
[6:23:35] pbj_time: ive heard spellfrost/spellfire bolts are kinda dog water
[6:24:14] SuaSponte: unless you are trying to heal spellfrist is super terrible
[6:24:49] dramajohns: I tried running burnout but it oomed me real quick. I was pumping tough. probably need master of elements.
[6:24:52] Diabolikkgg: I dont think ice lance works with the 50% crit dam rune, didnt see an increase in damage
[6:24:55] SnotBoogey: @pbj_time spellforst heals you and broccs of brain freeze and is free on procc tho.
[6:24:57] Viccili: boomie eclipse is bugged its giving starsurge 30% crit when it shouldnt, but also the pushback avoidance isnt functional
[6:25:24] Diabolikkgg: using with rank1 frost bolts + missile
[6:25:24] relot: hello ziqo I’m a french viewers and it’s funny to watch this french gamers get rekt et remind it in your subs songs 😂
[6:25:29] Speyto: yea it looks like the best belt unless u got pyro
[6:25:40] Speyto: belt is hot streak
[6:25:41] tomramsden: Spellfrost Bolt?
[6:25:42] pbj_time: chrono pres actually is interesting -- it can consume arcane blast stacks without costing more mana, but benefiting from the stacks.. but pve strat only
[6:25:47] deenox: @Viccili Wrong
[6:25:49] deenox: It gives 60%
[6:25:51] deenox: while should give 30%
[6:25:58] Speyto: ah my bad
[6:26:06] lixtix: eclipse should benefit eclpise, not a bug
[6:26:12] SuaSponte: as frost on belt probably frostfire if you are brain freeze right?
[6:26:17] deenox: Yes, starsurge should benefit from eclipse. But it is benefitting twice.
[6:26:24] pbj_time: you have to precast it before getting arcane blast stacks though
[6:26:26] SnotBoogey: @SuaSponte no spellfrost. brain freeze effects spellfrost also
[6:26:28] Speyto: frost mage dont have a clear option the frostfire bolts are meh and missile barrage prob better
[6:26:30] deenox: Yes
[6:26:31] deenox: x
[6:26:32] deenox: d
[6:26:42] lixtix: 3how does it benefit twice?
[6:26:54] deenox: Good question, but starsurge has 60% crit.
[6:26:56] snekkn1: bro we need a buff.. our first starsurge almost never critt
[6:27:00] hobbehesu: Every fotm class is afraid they're going to get hunter nerfed
[6:27:02] Viccili: @deenox the tooltip is not suppose to buff starsurge or starfire crit, only reduce its cast time by 1 sec.
[6:27:11] deenox: @Viccili wrong
[6:27:15] deenox: Read starsurge
[6:27:40] deenox: "STarusrge benefits from and trigger most talents and effects that trigger of benefit from Wrath or Starfire."
[6:27:58] dramajohns: I think running frostfire or spellfrost in belt it feels like a waste since u can just fireball instead and run barrage.
[6:28:16] Viccili: @deenox ahh hmm was that from phase 1 aswell, thought it gained benefits from starfire only
[6:28:25] deenox: Yes always been like this
[6:28:39] pbj_time: missile barrage is insane
[6:28:53] dramajohns: true
[6:29:02] pbj_time: arcane frost healer will probably be pretty good in pvp
[6:29:12] dramajohns: yea u get missile rank at 40 too.
[6:29:20] SnotBoogey: @dramajohns spellfrost heals you with beacon on and applies chilled so it can procc another brain freeze.
[6:29:28] stokes_t: you gonna get into gnomer before the lockout?
[6:29:37] cihanyaa: birdgeRave
[6:29:40] SnotBoogey: instant free spellfrost that heals you seems pretty good to me
[6:29:47] Speyto: it does 425 base damage over 2.5 sec, that's without sp etc
[6:30:09] dramajohns: @SnotBoogey yea true. but brain freeze is only 15% and if u run regen u can run fof. and fof is better in my opinion in this phase
[6:30:17] dramajohns: cant*
[6:30:20] Jimmy_Large: rewind is from the goblin guy I think
[6:30:30] shadowz04322: @Ziqoftw yo should i level my mage to 40 next? just did rogue
[6:30:34] shadowz04322: HmmNotes
[6:30:44] SnotBoogey: @dramajohns yeah i think i will play fof andf chrono pres will be my heal mostly
[6:31:01] dramajohns: @SnotBoogey exactly, same
[6:31:17] Dustwellow: @shadowz04322 lvl dh
[6:31:38] pbj_time: there is no world where taking spellfrost bolt and brainfreeze is good, when you can just play chrono pres and missle barrage
[6:31:38] shadowz04322: arcane mage was fun at 25
[6:32:20] stokes_t: you gonna jump into gnomer tonight?
[6:32:30] onlypyros: Could you please show the talents for Frost+Barrage strat?
[6:32:53] Carcer69: Do it with the brick for the first time
[6:32:53] stromboli_gabagool: are you in the otk invitational?
[6:32:54] pbj_time: the 2nd part of chrono pres is nice that its off gcd
[6:33:03] wheeezyp: ya you need gnomer :)
[6:33:09] JamesRig: That dagger dropped and i lost last night Sadge
[6:33:12] EulerGRJ: this is the master BIS inside gnomer tho @Ziqoftw https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/previously-unobtainable-mount-drops-in-gnomeregan-season-of-discovery-337661
[6:33:18] engzyng: is this atlas loot for SoD ? if yes how do you get it ?
[6:33:32] Nonprophetx: you would think they would update the skins on some of the epic gear though instead of giving lvl 8 shitter dagger skins lol
[6:33:39] hiro25000: Check cloth set (the one is armor bonus)
[6:34:31] mealtiime: those rings are Bricasso specials
[6:34:40] SnotBoogey: @Ziqoftw look at the engineering belt!
[6:34:55] hobbehesu: Retricutioner, lmao
[6:34:58] hobbehesu: buffed ret aura

[6:35:38] pbj_time: but the engi belt also seems really really good
[6:35:41] hobbehesu: the 3-set is nice
[6:35:42] SnotBoogey: the negineering belt looks fun
[6:35:58] dramajohns: the armor is so nice
[6:36:06] Trondycam: pvp will be crazy cool
[6:36:30] Carcer69: Imagine boomi with the arcane staff
[6:36:42] zauan: man, this song!
[6:37:02] Carcer69: Need first global
[6:37:10] SnotBoogey: @Ziqoftw you gotta check the crafted epic engineerign belt with on use.
[6:37:43] Viccili: boomie wants dagger and stv ohhand i think
[6:37:51] Viccili: off*
[6:38:05] SnotBoogey: its not from gnomer

[6:44:15] Azkafan: id rather have dmg than mobility
[6:44:21] gregtehcow: didnt they almost give mortal strike to every melee in retail
[6:44:22] Azkafan: classic = no mobility imo
