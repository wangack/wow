[4:37:40] Radund01: It is terribly to use your teeth ... terrible Idea
[4:37:44] Rezbit__: did you know that some flip flop sandals have built-in bottle openers?
[4:37:52] aly09848: You can open it with a lighter as well but it’s a pain
[4:38:00] GenghisJahn: Got a key? Grab the top and use the key as a lever
[4:38:12] Draleric: They keep wiping in BFD, final bosses are tough
[4:38:24] Radund01: If that tooth breaks from using your teeth, I can promise it will be the worst pain you have ever felt in your life.  Unless you have broken your femur.
[4:38:45] CobaltStreak: monkaS

[4:44:47] Radund01: please WoW Gods
[4:44:53] Radund01: ruin my free time
[4:45:13] Rezbit__: is frost the way to go for solo questing?
[4:45:14] Radund01: Nah, I love the thrill
[4:45:54] uwuphoria: what level is aethel now?
[4:46:10] Rezbit__: risky yet boring
[4:46:11] aly09848: The scariest bosses in MC are baron geddon, maybe shazzrah, majordomo, and ragnaros imo
[4:46:12] Pete_Tom_Braun: So what is the endgame in classic? Gering up for raids to get gear for harder raids? Never played WoW
[4:46:15] Orudd: ahh hope
[4:46:20] Radund01: Frost def makes single mobs easier to kill because of the slow.  How you play it though is up to you
[4:46:28] IyaJenkei: yea i was hoping for sod HC too
[4:47:02] Radund01: I just hope they do it eventually.
[4:47:03] Rezbit__: heck, what’s the cast time for a fireball?
[4:47:20] Radund01: Def will be a horde character on SoD HC
[4:48:27] Draleric: Buff but no raid Sadge
[4:48:28] Rezbit__: like… i REALLY want to try fire mage in classic… but holy crap 3.5 secs.  nty
[4:48:47] Vercingetorix36: revered
[4:48:49] Fanrogh: revered
[4:49:47] Coorsking3000: no raid? booo
[4:49:57] Radund01: Just play death must die
[4:50:06] PaperbackWritter: maybe try finding a group in HC elite
[4:50:10] filipebar: yeah on a hardcore server.... yeah pugs are dangerous
[4:50:30] Radund01: PUGS are easy .... to configure thats it LUL
[4:51:05] the_gringe: imagine you die because of some rando moron
[4:51:46] Rezbit__: you ever been to Des Moines in Iowa?
[4:51:49] filipebar: its why i would never play on one, im a semi squishy (Shammy) healer main with terrible luck when it comes to reliable guilds so going into a HC server is no bueno
[4:52:35] the_gringe: stoner quest title HUH
[4:52:37] Radund01: My HC guild just degrades everyone that dies.  Its amazing.  Every death is filled with laughter
[4:53:40] Draleric: PepeLaugh
[4:53:44] filipebar: mind you i have no interest in classic as i remember binging it back when it was OG release
[4:53:44] Radund01: They are great people.  Guild chat is mainly filled with F and get chromed, thanks for being fertilizers, etc.

[4:56:08] Fanrogh: and you cant have other intbuffs other then mage int so if the only juju that is helpful to you is int then there is no point in farming it
[4:56:10] Rezbit__: @radund01 looked tempting
[4:56:41] Fanrogh: i use frostres juju when i raid naxx but you can raid without frostress juju
