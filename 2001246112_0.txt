[1:05:26] Irahh: Good Morning
[1:05:30] Sollice: Well we went to see a house yesterday. House looked great on the inside. Then I went down to the basement and it was a disaster
[1:05:34] NobodybetterPat: morning guys! towHAMUP
[1:05:50] neuemeloria: Hey mr Towellie :) Are you playing Mordhau sometimes?!
[1:06:00] Mecabeast: I heard congress has a vote soon on whether corporation can be in the housing market or some shit
[1:06:19] Alaquane: basements don't sound fun for earthquakes
[1:06:28] Derca_: my first house had an unfinished basement, and then had over two feet of water in it during Irene
[1:06:38] Sollice: It was unfinished..which is fine...but it can't be finished. ceiling too small, electrical everywhere. Not done professionally. You could tell someone did a lot of wiring and plubking themselves
[1:07:02] Sollice: Which sucks because the house is on half acre. great porch. huge fenced in area for the dogs
[1:07:48] geokouts: if the price looks suspicious there is ALWAYS a catch
[1:08:13] Sollice: Yeah we could. It's still not a basement you can finish. The house was 123 years old. Back then they didn't really build basements to think about living space. If I put in a ceiling on the basement ( which alone is 1200 square foot ) then it would be about 6 foot tall
[1:08:23] Wulfgrym: i worked in building permits for a good chunk of my career, i have a simple rule if i see crappy dyi in the open i assume there are a bunch of dyi crap hiding in the house too.
[1:08:39] JamboKong: We got hit by Francis and Gene Hurricanes in Florida. We were homeless for about a year and then got to go sleep in sleeping bags in our home with the no walls just the shell. Had to go to FEMA  distribution center for food and water. Hurricanes are terrifying.
[1:08:43] geokouts: a 1900 House???
[1:08:57] Sollice: @Wulfgrym Yep thats what I am concerned about. I put a bid on the house contingent on inspection. So if they accept we will see what they have
[1:09:00] cyrex172: that was a marathon last night for sure
[1:09:05] Kaykerrs: carpal tunnel is real when you open packas
[1:09:10] Sollice: @geokouts Yep. Ohio so that wouldn't be uncommon
[1:09:14] PigPenLen: @JamboKong definitely a safe assumption for sure
[1:09:17] cyrex172: i was tired by the end of the rips and i wasnt the opne ripping
[1:09:21] Molvonos: The animation of your hands.
[1:09:25] Amarlian: it's called a repetitive stress injury
[1:09:36] tr4ncetv: just have to keep opening packs to get them used to it
[1:09:43] Wulfgrym: @Sollice well since the basement isn't completed, the inspector can at least see the work done, inspections are great for unfinished ar eas, but useless in finished houses
[1:10:11] tr4ncetv: will do
[1:10:11] Sollice: Yep. And if get there, I am getting a foundation inspection as well
[1:10:17] Holysal: @geokouts yep mine is 1300. NE Ohio is cheaper

[3:17:25] im_capy: at a HIGH lvl
[3:17:28] LimpyMcGee1: i think what hurt him was the last half of his career was during the greatest show on turf and the start of the pass becoming big. He didn't get to gain much from that.

[3:54:45] Molvonos: Lies
[3:54:51] Maydie6066: @91Niki one of my top 5 emotes was towRekt and i believe it was because of you Kappa
[3:54:59] 91Niki: 1324 hours watched, 1041 of them is Towelliee LUL

[3:57:00] 91Niki: Pretty sure my 2022 recap of twitch was closer to 2k hours watched
[3:57:18] ChumpsMcGee: sit = crit = mana
[3:58:30] Maydie6066: @91Niki my 2023 was massively lower than 2022, i attrribute it to having a Kid and not being in my office as much anymore so my only streaming option was my Playstation

[4:00:35] Afrostump: the clear solution to paladin tank not taking enough damage is to 2h tank with verigan's fist
[4:00:41] Maydie6066: @91Niki i still blame you for my #3 emote being towRekt  lol
[4:01:23] DrkPhoenix6913: @Maydie6066 i wonder if that does - because there are times i do watch 2
[4:01:29] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 Multiple streams probably counts. Plus some people literally have their streams up non stop, and some people don't turn their pc off. Gattz used to have Towelliee up non stop when he worked from home
[4:01:56] DrkPhoenix6913: thats me, always on while working from home

[6:07:21] Arocian: lol
[6:07:28] mavericks312: its not in classic spirit lol
[6:07:33] gelimarr: Walking simulator hehe
[6:07:35] 91Niki: Les is taking his GM break seriously and socializing
[6:07:37] Molvonos: Did he actually say that?
[6:07:43] Arocian: LMAO
[6:07:48] Wulfgrym: Esfand needs to focus on his mustache and leave shit alone
[6:07:50] mavericks312: thats his reasoning though
[6:07:55] Arocian: This is Classic Plus /with changes
[6:07:57] Molvonos: I don't believe he was stupid enough to say that
[6:07:57] souljazz: LUL classic spirit
[6:08:04] Wulfgrym: esfand has been ranting on about classic spirit over and over so maybe.
[6:08:08] Arocian: this isn't classic andy no changes

[6:08:32] akia03: did you get your shield and ring?
[6:08:32] mattjfrank: @Towelliee  TBC i think
[6:08:32] im_capy: the most classic thing for me, is a FP that takes 20 mins to get 20 feet
[6:08:37] xmedpakx: it just a way to get ppl riled up
[6:08:40] Molvonos: I mean, shit.  Mages have Living Flame, which not even retail has.
[6:08:40] Wulfgrym: classic is over there >>>>>>
[6:08:41] Arocian: Yep, Classic Plus right here bois

[6:09:01] TheeCableguy: and I love it
[6:09:01] gimmlay: pretty much wow OSRS
[6:09:02] EKS90_: Mages have a healing specc thati s not on retail, this is not classic
[6:09:03] Jsibs: Meta isnt retail
[6:09:09] EKS90_: classic spirit my ass LUL
[6:09:10] Amarlian: and I personally hope they take SoD right through BC
[6:09:14] yib_: its seasonal content! its the same as seasonal stuff in diablo how hard is that to understand
[6:09:18] Arocian: <<<< classic andies - Classic Plus (this) - Retail WoW >>>>
[6:09:19] BubbaChubbs420: @Molvonos agreed
[6:09:22] mavericks312: he only wants passives added in phase 2
[6:09:25] im_capy: Holly was OSRS, so no surprise with SoD imo
[6:09:30] Spykex02: i play as long as its fun, if its nerfed to ground, then back to retail lol
[6:09:32] Wulfgrym: Esfand can go rotate in Only Fangs and live his glory years
[6:09:48] Wulfgrym: Esfand doesn't like boss mechanics either

[6:09:51] Amarlian: Druid Symbiosis when?

[6:09:52] gelimarr: I want that insanity shadow priest spell
[6:09:55] im_capy: next we gonna ask for auto bubble again too?
[6:09:59] Wulfgrym: nope
[6:10:01] Arocian: Yep, ADD the New Stuff, All the New Stuff
[6:10:03] Bendditt: Esfand still thinks he is in highschool.
[6:10:08] Alaquane: can I get full moon?
[6:10:09] Wulfgrym: feels the bfd mechanics is too much like retail
[6:10:12] Bloodhaven08: he said they were too complex
[6:10:30] EKS90_: has Esfand lost it ? LUL I don't watch him much but if u want classic spirit, go play Era?... there are more versions
[6:10:38] Molvonos: Apparently Esfand has the attention span of a five year old.
[6:10:39] Molvonos: Jesus.
[6:10:52] mavericks312: 100% did
[6:10:53] Arocian: lol
[6:10:59] im_capy: auto attacks are the perfect game play
[6:11:01] Wulfgrym: actually I heard him say they were too complex, same time he was complaining about the mechanics
[6:11:07] Bloodhaven08: they were too player vs environment were his words
[6:11:09] polaropposite76: lol les
[6:11:16] gelimarr: PVP player mindset
[6:11:17] mavericks312: i think you forget esfand is a hardcore classic andy
[6:11:21] Shurn_82: i find a lot of Esfand's comment are just for the shock value lol
[6:11:26] Arocian: Classic andy / Min Maxer issue is there's new content that isn't Min Maxed before it launches
[6:11:28] Snabido: Jebaited
[6:11:40] aspiration89: @Shurn_82 100% half the shit he says is sarcasm/trolling
[6:11:45] im_capy: sounds like a reddit post
[6:11:51] TheeCableguy: maybe for classic
[6:11:58] mavericks312: compared to classic tank and spank raids to him they are
[6:12:04] Bloodhaven08: thats fine I watch to be trolled
[6:12:05] gelimarr: I like classic but I prefer raiding in retail
[6:12:08] Thralazaar: nah he's kinda right with that one, most of the bosses have a run around and dodge shit mechanic and that's retail in a nutshell
[6:12:09] Wulfgrym: lets hope Esfand is LUL
[6:12:11] veryhairyheyyall: towCopium
[6:12:19] CongoJackNA: What he was saying is that he doesnt want to see a bunch of movement speed mechanics added, because then the boss fights have to become more like retail and player vs environment
[6:12:25] DarkCymru: its not always relaible
[6:12:26] CongoJackNA: he liked BFD as it is
[6:12:42] im_capy: Its almost like they dont want to learn new things about the game
[6:12:45] Wulfgrym: if i wanted classic, i would go back to pagle
[6:12:51] DarkCymru: I mostly disagree with classic andies for a reason
[6:13:07] Bloodhaven08: that is the E yes
[6:13:10] Wulfgrym: no changes!!! /drool
[6:13:11] Buttscratchrr: classic will never be classic again and honestly SOD is the best fun I have had in a long long time!
[6:13:14] DarkCymru: but they are half right on problems of retail wow
[6:13:15] EKS90_: PVE stands for player vs enviroment....
[6:13:20] CongoJackNA: He meant it in a way that you have to focus more on moving around than the boss itself
[6:13:38] Thralazaar: i get what esfand is saying. the mechanics in bfd are more focused on dodging shit than fighting the boss

[6:16:07] ashton_youbooty: no dungeon finder killed wrath
[6:16:11] xmedpakx: i leveled to 80 and quit
[6:16:16] EasyPeasley: wrath is just GDKP simulator
[6:16:21] iamsnaps: when your a starcraft fan and it doesnt even get mentioned at blizcon :(

[6:16:23] mavericks312: wrath needed dungeon finder at launch
[6:16:25] Thunderbrew: So Cata will have Dungeon Finder?
[6:16:36] mavericks312: cata about to have LFR at launch
[6:16:42] DarkCymru: i belive mog at start
[6:16:48] Thunderbrew: I didn't play Wrath because of no Dungeon Finder
[6:16:52] alienistslol: @EasyPeasley every, and I mean every classic expac will have GDKP
[6:16:55] Ryuenjin: I think there was an article today that said no LFR at launch
[6:17:01] gelimarr: I remember LFR'ing DS in Cata.. good times
[6:17:02] kostchie: @EasyPeasley That is all every rendition of WOW is today.
[6:17:12] Roughneck124: @xmedpakx I did the same thing, got some gear, and then nothing after that.
[6:17:18] Ryuenjin: One thing I will say however just to set expectations is that its almost a certainty that we’d not be able to deliver LFR versions of any of the earlier tiers of raiding before Dragon Soul. That is very simply out of scope for the launch or early patches of Cataclysm Classic.
[6:17:22] mavericks312: if they dont have LFR at launch there gonna lose players
[6:17:25] ambiotic: that would be a massive mistake
[6:17:29] im_capy: Its a marketing term now
[6:17:33] ambiotic: Cata was balanced around lfg
[6:17:36] ambiotic: so that would be stupid
[6:17:43] Celicon: kinda surprised they did add an LFG, to Sod
[6:17:47] lmtheboogie: speaking straight facts
[6:17:48] Alaquane: LFR only came out for dragon soul. how do you make a new difficulty tier to all those other raids?
[6:17:48] Celicon: didn’t
[6:17:52] Shrenko: how are druid healers in SOD doing?

[6:17:55] ambiotic: the big daily was an lfg dungeon, it was a massive part of playing cata
[6:17:56] Buttscratchrr: classic will never be classic again and that's okay! We got other greatness like sod
[6:17:57] alienistslol: Cata had some of the best raids and leveling experience
[6:18:00] Simply_Ryanari: in terms of classic, it's not like vanilla. The talents and class states are based off the end of vanilla and people don't have to go through all the updates and changes that happened throughout vanilla patches
[6:18:02] mavericks312: Cata will lose players if they dont have LFR at launch mark my words
[6:18:05] ohlszon: Classic vanilla was best part about classic i was 16 all over again
[6:18:08] EKS90_: @ambiotic not the first 2 raid tiers no.
[6:18:12] MedicineMan: Blizzard needs to stop dividing the community. So many classic versions rn
[6:18:30] Ryuenjin: @Shrenko Around mid-tier. Overshadowed by Priest and Mage
[6:18:31] Molvonos: @MedicineMan They're not really dividing the community though.
[6:18:33] kostchie: Cata did not have LFR until DS
[6:18:40] im_capy: Keep the subs rolling ya
[6:18:47] Molvonos: Like, I play SOD, but I've no interest in the 'regular' classic iterations.
[6:18:50] Molvonos: So I never play them.
[6:19:08] ambiotic: i liked gama dungeons, that is the only classic thing ive enjoyed

[6:19:17] iamsnaps: @Molvonos im only playing sod now otherwise i wouldnt be playing wow atall
[6:19:44] gelimarr: what is gama
[6:19:49] Molvonos: @iamsnaps Yep.  I'm primarily retail, i've been playing WoW since 2004, so the idea of replaying content i've done before, wasn't interesting.  SoD is new though
[6:20:34] lmtheboogie: sod was a genius idea. I love the idea that they have this classic foundation to experiment on seasonally to really see what classic players want
[6:20:40] OkayLegacy: is this game fun
[6:20:47] veryhairyheyyall: ^yes
[6:20:48] ambiotic: retail is arguably the best its been since last tier of legion. its hard to stop playing it when I got alts i wana do
[6:20:50] Buttscratchrr: Sod is a beta for something in the future also that being said it is also keeping players busy until cata and retail comes out  during the SOD time they will gage and see how popular that it will come
[6:21:51] im_capy: Once I kinda accepted that I truely dont own my account or toons, it was easier for me to enjoy all version of wow. Before I could only play retail, because it was my "main" toon for so long. Now I just enjoy warcraft as a whole
[6:21:52] Nokterian: DF is fucking great
[6:21:54] Thunderbrew: I'm hoping for MoP Classic
[6:22:02] Lauralana: I had gotten 2 magician mantles within 24 hrs the other day. Got my shoulders and made 24g same time.
[6:22:07] gelimarr: Legion BiS
[6:22:18] alienistslol: MoP classic hype!!! Best raids and pvp
[6:22:26] Nokterian: Its evergreen expansion and more evergreen expansions are coming
[6:22:30] gelimarr: I do miss MoP
[6:22:32] mavericks312: ive said it all xpac DF will be a top 3 xpac for the majority
[6:22:40] Thralazaar: i prefer all of legion to any part of dragonflight honestly
[6:22:52] deaddwarfwalking: late legion was good.  the random lego drop was not fun.
[6:22:57] gelimarr: The story and end-gaming was the best in MoP, IMO
[6:23:24] dinomiyte: im so confused on why they are re releasing the game... why dont they just stick with classic
[6:23:36] Arocian: I def like that each SOD phase will be 6 to 8 weeks long, hopefully
[6:23:40] CDubTheRIPper: danK
[6:23:44] ohlszon: That sounds good asf
[6:23:50] kostchie: I see no real excitement in SOD, outside of the runes, Ashenvale, and BFD raid. It is the same Classic game I have played for the last year, in both HC and Era.
[6:23:50] gelimarr: gummy yummy
[6:23:54] tr4ncetv: @dinomiyte because people like playing different thing sso maximize profits
[6:23:57] mavericks312: @dinomiyte weird concept but companies like money
[6:23:57] Lauralana: @gelimarr yeah it was my fav too
[6:24:11] EasyPeasley: @kostchie so except for the 4 new things, its the same? what LUL
[6:24:20] TheeCableguy: @Towelliee for shield dont you want the spike vs stamina?
[6:24:21] jerriix: towIgnit
[6:24:49] TheeCableguy: can buy on ah

[6:24:56] gelimarr: Phase 2 - Feb 2024
[6:25:00] dinomiyte: but its not different, its the same shit... i play wow im not hating or anything im just curious
[6:25:02] Shurn_82: spike is bs isnt it
[6:25:06] ambiotic: Is this the biggest scam in gaming history? https://twitter.com/FntasticHQ/status/1734265789237338453
[6:25:06] ClassicMalcontent: BS apply them too I think?
[6:25:08] kostchie: @EasyPeasley The runes are new. The other three are just reformated content.
[6:25:13] Alaquane: have to be bs to apply 150
[6:25:17] Shurn_82: yea
[6:25:17] TheeCableguy: dont think so
[6:25:20] TheeCableguy: like weights
[6:25:23] ClassicMalcontent: BS can 'apply' to yours I think...
[6:25:25] TheeCableguy: you do?
[6:25:27] TheeCableguy: huh
[6:25:28] ResurgenceHD: yes 150 bs
[6:25:42] kostchie: @kostchie Even the runes are not new. The are just talents that were converted to runes
[6:25:42] Alaquane: iron shield spike
[6:25:49] TheeCableguy: I can hop on
[6:26:28] gelimarr: lava

[6:27:38] Alaquane: everyone send bars to towelliee
[6:27:41] Allsee_: 150 to apply it
[6:27:48] Alaquane: spikes might be able to be applied via trade
[6:27:55] TheeCableguy: can I not apply it to him?
[6:27:59] Shrenko: @ambiotic holy shit...
[6:28:02] tofuwizard: Specced into Summons
[6:28:06] Allsee_: Yes
[6:28:07] Shurn_82: any BS with 150 BS can apply it like enchanting tow

[6:29:06] tofuwizard: They are huggin it out now
[6:29:08] AzedaNA: You just have to hang around
[6:29:09] CongoJackNA: During the event everyone is PVEing the bosses for rep
[6:29:13] Alaquane: it's 99% pve
[6:29:17] Simply_Ryanari: horde and alliance phase onto different layers and both get a win
[6:29:20] CongoJackNA: its between the events that everyone kills each other
[6:29:21] Shurn_82: Ive seen groups moving
[6:29:29] Shurn_82: while questing
[6:29:33] Ryuenjin: Not really, it's basically Alterac Valley 2.0
[6:29:38] ohlszon: There is fighting in ashenvale so each side get 100% then its full PvE after LUL
[6:29:40] Alaquane: you do get pvp flagged. and sometimes the horde or alliance will defend a base
[6:30:10] im_capy: So is that ashenvale pvp mount just gonna be a wasted bag space when real mounts come?
[6:30:11] LiLTommyTucker: basically AV but in ashenvale
[6:30:15] Arocian: The two sides are all grp'd at the bosses/locations that need to be captured and there doesn't seem to be much overlap so Horde and Alliance don't interact much from what I've seen

[6:31:00] kostchie: That was last week. Most people do not want a thing to do with Ashenvale or PVP in general.
[6:31:13] neftario105: @towelliee can I send picture of my marvel cards on your discord?
[6:31:14] Alaquane: there was a really close fight this morning, both bosses at 5% hp. that turned into a real pvp battle with both sides trying to kill the other healers
[6:32:03] gelimarr: Security Engineer freaking out rn
[6:32:24] Shurn_82: I collect credit cards, all signed and everything
[6:33:08] PlatinumTissue: quick question: If you had frog hands for hands, would you be better gamer?
[6:33:23] Ryuenjin: I figured they would have implemented a thing to let people challenge folks directly based on bnet tag or something by now
