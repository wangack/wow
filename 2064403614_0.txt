[0:05:36] aSimpleCocktail: Question when you have a moment - why no inner fire on disc pvp talent spec?
[0:05:46] prodigy_wow: I played holy in Wsg to finish my epic bracer grind
[0:05:54] prodigy_wow: Spirit of the redeemer is so bad
[0:06:42] Zulp: 1.5k crit rofl
[0:06:48] grenis_: you done any gold farming as shadow?
[0:06:54] FatesFavoriteFool: get addon that just shows dots above name plates instead
[0:08:26] ama__deus: Sound logic, really
[0:09:12] FatesFavoriteFool: true true i forgot how smll the range is
[0:09:38] OoThomioO: sw:d hotfix
[0:09:40] grenis_: uh oh, they nerfing shadow now Sadge
[0:09:55] prodigy_wow: I was trying to sell spider belts ... Nobody wants one :(
[0:10:07] prodigy_wow: So I sent one to you lol
[0:10:09] ama__deus: Oh, shit. That addon actually seems promising, though
[0:11:08] Alori_: needing add ons to play the game, pff
[0:13:14] Prohx: Max 1 hour
[0:13:29] Prohx: Was same for eu 13 hours ago
[0:13:40] OoThomioO: can you not have plater track dots above health bars?
[0:13:46] OoThomioO: or does that not work with sod
[0:13:50] Prohx: yes last night
[0:14:08] argybis: @Hydramist  how long  is shutdown
[0:14:24] ama__deus: Does the targeting work already?
[0:14:37] OoThomioO: whew, that sounds too good for sod tbh
[0:14:46] uthitheth: i stopped at p1 because bis gear was gated behind raids, is p2 the same?
[0:15:06] ama__deus: Yeah, might detarget, because you're clicking nothing
[0:15:18] ama__deus: @uthitheth HUH
[0:15:41] FatesFavoriteFool: @uthitheth aside from a few pieces like prof helm/wsg bracers its the same yea
[0:15:50] uthitheth: @FatesFavoriteFool thanks
[0:15:52] testestkappa: hydra how long can u keep this act going.. go back to arena
[0:15:59] FatesFavoriteFool: have to do gnomer to get helm as well
[0:17:18] moosywow: do u like shared pain more than homonculi because of spirit tap?
[0:17:41] FatesFavoriteFool: shared pain for the blackouts alone is pog
[0:17:50] Mystiggo: Did you see Martyrdom hotfix sent out
[0:17:57] Roguetiano: hydra would you do a quick rotation guide for pve
[0:18:07] hqeye: Hey hydra, how important is it for priest to get exalted WSG and AB rep? Thinking about doing a priest alt, but scared of having to do the rep grinding again
[0:18:12] uthitheth: do you wish sod had rated arena? I feel like the mode lacks an end game without it
[0:18:36] ama__deus: Still okayish, but targeting through the tracker would be bis
[0:18:37] Mystiggo: Yep
[0:18:49] chopptimus1: chopptimus1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:18:51] prodigy_wow: @hqeye wsg worth it, ab not worth it imo
[0:19:08] ama__deus: I wish shared pain wouldn't refresh pain on targets which already have it. That's so troll

[0:22:29] Mystiggo: I see
[0:23:00] Plushie__Tv: sounds similar to stacked nameplates in a way not sure if thats worth checking out? Not sure if theres a function to see the dots on each target
[0:23:32] ama__deus: Their argument for not having 40 y nameplates was so dumb as well
[0:24:08] Bronpal: wrong monitor streaming ? :)
[0:24:36] Frogsoup: I remember there being a warlock addon like that back in 2019 classic, it was called Necrosis. Not sure if it can work with Spriest

[0:24:49] Mystiggo: 2nd comment says you CAN configure bars to be clickable
[0:25:09] Mystiggo: That it doesn't say LUL
[0:25:09] merek22: whats the rune addon?
[0:25:39] Arrone: Isnt what you are trying to do against TOS?
[0:26:14] majingold: Did you change your background?
[0:26:15] ama__deus: RXP does it for quest mobs
[0:26:34] Arrone: There was an addon called EnemyGrid that did a similar thing. That was against TOS so the dev team made changes so it wasnt possible anymore
[0:27:04] Shinraxd: where are the pog tunes
[0:27:42] ama__deus: yoink
[0:28:13] bisonkron: @majingold he is on the other side of the room
[0:28:14] Shinraxd: these last days your playlist was sicko
[0:28:29] ama__deus: RXP gives you a frame you can click to target quest mobs, so don't think it's impossible

[0:30:35] Arrone: I mean if you find something that works let me know cause im looking for this as well lmao. Willing to use it till I get banned
[0:31:16] j1mb00lman: I played holy in Gnomer the other day, it def has good output
[0:31:46] jaimonji: warth koth >
[0:31:55] j1mb00lman: Had 2 druids for innervates
[0:32:01] thenazzgu1: No wrath arena koth?
[0:32:08] j1mb00lman: No I would have went disc
[0:32:19] j1mb00lman: Lmao
[0:32:39] jaimonji: would you rather have ps or dispersion as disc in wrath arena
[0:32:47] j1mb00lman: On the bosses where you can click buttons back for mana it's fine
[0:32:54] j1mb00lman: The other bosses I would have without innervate
[0:33:14] Kaekias: @jaimonji ps can be cast on teammates, which makes it superior
[0:33:27] j1mb00lman: I used dispersion for mana regen as well
[0:33:38] j1mb00lman: Pain supp seems not needed at all
[0:33:43] forteen03: can you show your spec plz
[0:33:45] Ryxon: Is SWD fine?
[0:33:47] jaimonji: @Kaekias yeah but disperse is mana and less cd
[0:34:09] jaimonji: would you rather have death or mass dispel
[0:34:13] jaimonji: in warth arnea
[0:34:14] nezyaftw: hey, Koth on the wrath?
[0:34:15] Kaekias: i admit, his response of "depends on the matchup" was better :)
[0:34:33] j1mb00lman: My death will crit for like 1500 lmao
[0:34:58] GreenLizzardx: pvp feels abit wierd first one to get off 2 globals wins

[0:49:31] Kaekias: as stated, i think he is leveling as shadow atm. but his first priest was leveled as disc
[0:49:42] Sinostra: didn't you say shadow is bad before 40 ?
[0:50:00] Kaekias: hence why i said he is just messing about and this is not to be taken too seriously

[0:56:38] ama__deus: Transfer from death to spike
[0:57:00] Mystiggo: They could either increase Mind Spike damage OR lower both CD and damage of Death, keeping dps relatively same but decreasing burst
[0:57:23] ama__deus: Blast does hit like a wet noodle for what it's supposed to be
[0:57:44] ama__deus: On the other hand, you can guarantee blast crits, so if it would hit as hard as death, it'd be a huge buff really LUL

[1:57:46] HeyImArty: 60 epic shoulders & a staff (19 stam 10 int 2% crit 41 spelldmg)
[1:58:19] HeyImArty: They probably capped the "easy" rep at revered again (STV coin rep turnins)
[1:58:26] HeyImArty: same way they capped ashenvale rep at revered
[1:59:00] HeyImArty: the best reward from exalted AB is the tabard tho lets be real

[2:10:40] hughjasses: they bumrush the shadowform
[2:12:44] Kaekias: most compatible class/spec to play with (your) shadow? :p
[2:12:59] Kaekias: nono, mean in general
[2:13:01] tangdill: is ther earena in sod
[2:13:11] Kaekias: for like bgs/open world pvp
[2:13:22] tangdill: Arena tho
[2:13:36] Kaekias: i think there is no arena in SoD, sadly
[2:14:01] tangdill: Never understand blizzard

[2:14:14] Dirtyharry128: Shadow priest just does everything better then locks now

[2:18:14] weeping80: Bicep <3
[2:18:42] Kaekias: absolutely got hooked on bicep hydraLove
[2:18:45] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: but can you even imagine the balance at 60? They will 100% forget they buffed starfire from druid by 80%, and it will hit for 5000 next phase
[2:18:50] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: because it has 2 new ranks
[2:18:58] schandri: why would he regret arenas?`i mean, its just an extra thing you can do. even if its not balanced. you dont have to play it
[2:18:59] Sorrowsx: @Hydramist why the addon to hide people's names?
[2:19:31] Kaekias: so he won't get sniped open world. basically to prevent other ppl layering to his @Sorrowsx
[2:19:50] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @schandri it's ok if they give 0 rewards for arena, I wouldn't mind

[9:02:31] ogLIVE: @thommy_brasco dev said they won't change that
[9:02:33] DeathToad007: @thommy_brasco they said they are not becasue it changes gameplay too much for pvp and pve i.e. being able to see what above an dbelow you in caves etc.
[9:02:42] ReykooTv: he was mistaken
[9:02:45] ogLIVE: makes the game "easier"
[9:03:09] jonlelx: this is substantially more op than boomkin ever was
[9:03:44] classicdeth: douch

[9:04:04] DeathToad007: @jonlelx hydra is also one of the best priest players in the world so he makes it look easy
[9:04:06] jonlelx: so no you are still wrong
