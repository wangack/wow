[0:18:57] Layliah79: i don't have TikTok
[0:19:37] Daesaster: People who say that about TikTok don't understand how much other companies have your information also.
[0:19:38] Haestoh: Everyone spies on you, why pigeon hold yourself to just one government
[0:19:48] Twikwon: 19 raiders from Twikwon have joined! 
[0:19:52] SlithTheSivak: the US government banned it from all government phones and computers due to spying concerns..
[0:19:52] Twikwon: G'day there

[0:21:09] Twikwon: @smesus not wrong
[0:21:21] Twikwon: i am leveling a dracthyr alt purely for dragon riding
[0:21:21] calphan84: sadly maintenance is super long for na though

[0:21:37] mikeymoto: here
[0:21:39] DevoidX: hey
[0:21:41] Layliah79: 7am-3pm PST
[0:21:43] realicepick1: it's not to late to say happy new year, in fact it's actually too early, the real new year begins at the end of march
[0:21:45] Daesaster: Did you see the TF Blessed BOW of the Windseeker model coming 10.2.5?
[0:21:46] SlithTheSivak: dracJAM
[0:21:48] Haestoh: Ahoy!
[0:21:52] MediumRareOG: 8 HOUR PATCH
[0:22:01] Twikwon: it's definitely raid and run for me though im exhausted, have an amazing stream!
[0:23:03] databob1: It's not the spying that's the problem with tik tok its that China can't be held accountable in a court of law. The plan was to make them go through an American company like they do to our businesses in China, but a bunch of congressmen tried to turn it into a power grab so it fell through and there is no accountability for tik tok
[0:23:11] Haestoh: imjoesSurprise imjoesSurprise imjoesSurprise
[0:23:19] the_rethan_family: did you look at the Hearthstone disk-mount in the wowhead or MMO-champion modelviewer? It has complete dragonflying support. Including a unique barrel-roll.
[0:23:58] the_rethan_family: also, the peacock mounts also have dragonriding-animations
[0:24:37] AdamShwaginz: love me some good disk mounts
[0:24:46] Haestoh: If the Chinese government wanna look through my camera lens at my double chin while I'm sat on the toilet watching funny cat videos, be my guest mrgmKEKW mrgmKEKW mrgmKEKW
[0:24:56] databob1: Hiw do we get the hearthstone mount?
[0:25:23] xPOTIx: hey! when do you think we have more details of sod phase 2? nice content btw
[0:26:02] keyboardturner: KEKW
[0:26:18] keyboardturner: wtf
[0:27:25] COOP3R: probably off
[0:27:33] SlithTheSivak: even states have their own holidays that other states dont observe
[0:27:50] the_rethan_family: I tried to unlock the argent tournament content with my evoker. But apparently, they can't unlock any race-specific quests beyond the initial quests.
[0:27:50] MediumRareOG: MLK day is a day off for basically everyone
[0:28:03] CerebrillUK: its very 50/50, with people javing off MLK Day
[0:28:14] databob1: It's not about spying it's about dangerous or defamatory content being posted on tik tok and if tik tok refuses or neglects to remove it nothing can be done as China wouldn't recognize  any court ruling from the US
[0:28:55] MediumRareOG: Adin Ross met Trump at a wrestling event. This isn't new
[0:29:27] SlithTheSivak: trump did a wrestling intro w vince mcmahon a long time ago if i remember
[0:29:28] MediumRareOG: Oh UFC, yeah you're right
[0:30:26] databob1: @mrgm what's the other channel that you put the short on in youtube
[0:31:05] the_rethan_family: I also tried to unlock the underlight angler with my evoker. I could get the artifact pole without issue, but was unable to unlock any traits until a GM gave me the script to initiate the "unlock"-animation.
[0:31:30] keyboardturner: oh yeah I had to do that at some point
[0:31:50] keyboardturner: you gotta do `/run C_ArtifactUI.AddPower(1021)`

[0:32:54] Haestoh: Northerns make sure to join. We march at dawn down to Kings Landing (London) like Rob Stark.
[0:33:02] SlithTheSivak: no price better than free
[0:33:49] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:34:04] the_rethan_family: and for some time, you were unable to complete the final sunwell-scenario for Quel'delar as an Evoker, locking you into a phased Isle of Quel-Denas, making it impossible to do any shattered sun daylies and the sunwell.
[0:34:24] Haestoh: Dans one man rendition of MacBeth is the headline act guys!
[0:34:38] calphan84: evokers can't do the argent tournament either
[0:35:06] databob1: Great short...I also liked your pre dragonflight short
[0:35:25] SlithTheSivak: i want jousing extended to dragon riding.....dragonlance!
[0:35:27] keyboardturner: maybe not directly continue but like, an Argent Tournament 2.0 with modern mechanics and dragonriding
[0:35:29] the_rethan_family: I hope we get an updated tournament ground with "the last titan"

[0:36:36] the_rethan_family: Also, please don't give us another Dalaran for the next northrend expansion. It's an amazing city, but two times are enough.
[0:37:16] Asideus: Asideus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:37:19] SlithTheSivak: i feel like there will be a titan complex that will be unearthed in Midnight
[0:37:20] Lausten: Need to champion each faction
[0:37:41] the_rethan_family: if anything, put Dalaran back into the eastern kingdoms the next time you update the zones and turn it into an urban questing area.
[0:38:21] Harai_Ulfsark: dont think so, that hole is kinda small
[0:38:24] the_pyke: it must fit
[0:38:53] stralix: dala was designing it in alterac mountains, but then he ran away
[0:38:56] Grissu_: I'm still hoping for kalimdor, and easter rework, and also come back to orc vs humans politics, but I think that's a huge copium Sadge
[0:39:25] stralix: *woosh*
[0:39:57] keyboardturner: where is the source for northern EK getting a rework, thought it was just quel'thalas
[0:40:13] keyboardturner: no
[0:40:13] Haestoh: I want a zone that has the same aura as Duskwood. Drustvar in BFA was the closest I can think of but still not close.
[0:40:14] the_rethan_family: I really hope, we get to see the ebon blade's day to day business when we revisit Northrend. They really dropped the ball with them in Shadowlands.
[0:40:35] keyboardturner: northern EK = Lordaeron / Arathi / plaguelands etc
[0:41:04] jackjohny97: Why are you in northrend?
[0:41:13] keyboardturner: TWW early access
[0:41:21] the_rethan_family: The entire eastern coast of Quel'thalas is inaccessible. Imagine there being an Amanai Highland zone.
[0:41:28] jackjohny97: Ooh sick
[0:41:58] jackjohny97: Does it take long to get the rep for the argent mounts?
[0:42:09] jackjohny97: Havent done that in a minute
[0:42:39] Puhg: Good morning.
[0:42:42] SKARZYtwitch: SKARZYtwitch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[0:42:55] lopik_: They can just do time change like in Uldum or Undercity
[0:42:59] jackjohny97: In this spot that you are right now there was a stone u can interact with do you rmember that?
[0:43:00] Grissu_: I would love to see old zones with bfa+ graphic, but not rework in a Cataclysm way. Just a fresh textures, and models
[0:43:12] SKARZYtwitch: great what u been up to
[0:44:20] jackjohny97: Do you remember the stone that was interactable with and u reanact ilidan and lich king fight
[0:44:31] Akela3: i think so
[0:44:51] MediumRareOG: I'm really not sure about DF becoming the default levelling experience in TWW. I think BFA works well as is
[0:45:09] BBMezzy: Yup, it's going to be a super busy week
[0:45:20] jackjohny97: Tomorrow we get the new patch im so excited
[0:45:38] Paranigmayt: Don't forget the scarab event on the weekend
[0:46:04] stralix: today 17 years ago TBC was released
[0:46:05] ChrisStoll: Dying game / no content /s
[0:46:19] Big_Rum: Hello There!
[0:46:25] keyboardturner: modCheck
[0:46:30] jackjohny97: I saw ur video on yt you said ur fav new thing is follower dungeons, whats you thought on it
[0:46:48] the_rethan_family: If I were able to add something to the game, I would love to expand the Stormwind embassy by adding racial buildings. A pandaren teahouse, a underground dwarven smithy, a elven obervatory and move the brawlers guild overground as the gnomish Robodrome from Mechagon.
[0:47:46] ruffian0305: Brawlers Guild needs to come back
[0:48:05] mikeymoto: I tried follower dungeons on ptr. they were cool.
[0:48:14] jackjohny97: And just wanted to say i really like your videos on yt <3
[0:48:19] databob1: I heard somewhere that they nerfed the XP in follower dungeons...is that true?
[0:48:36] Priory: why is there no "this week in wow" post? pretty sus
[0:49:00] Priory: oh ty
[0:49:15] mikeymoto: definitely a good way to try new specs and classes

[0:50:23] the_rethan_family: The horde could carve another tunnel in Orgrimmar and turn it into a pleasure quarter with Nighborne bars, Goblin arcades and Tauren/Sindorei Shisha-bars
[0:50:49] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:50:51] jackjohny97: Stonks
[0:51:00] Haestoh: @the_rethan_family Blizzard hire this guy
[0:51:05] SlithTheSivak: they need to fill in the canyons of org and build the new city on top
[0:51:21] MediumRareOG: The only good thing about Orgrimmar is the Horrific Visions are better than Stormwind
[0:52:07] the_rethan_family: Finally, the alliance needs to rebuild Menethil harbor with Kul'tiran architecture and add a ferry that goes between Stromgarde, Gilneas and it.
[0:52:26] keyboardturner: yeah you're not supposed to be able to damage them like that KEKW
[0:53:09] SlithTheSivak: Polish Hussars were the best cavalry on the planet, their secret? their lances were longer
[0:53:11] jackjohny97: Do you know a good way to farm gold? Crafting excluded
[0:53:25] Suze_o_0: gooood monring folks, hope you are having a wonderful Tuesday!
[0:53:37] Suze_o_0: good to hear!
[0:53:43] MediumRareOG: does anyone still use boats?
[0:53:56] michaelmm: My conspiracy thory is that the harbor will be used as a staging ground for a priate related public event in 10.2.6!
[0:53:58] the_rethan_family: I am so full of visions on how I want an updated Exodar and Quel'thalas to look like but I am absolute crap in actual modelling or programming.
[0:54:30] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:55:03] Implied_Slight: slow riding is good if you want to afk a little bit
[0:55:03] jackjohny97: Dracthyr finaly gonna be able to fly like dragonriding 🎉
[0:55:06] Lausten: NPC in Dalaran
[0:55:32] Lestatis: Those bags are mighty tidy
[0:55:32] Puhg: I started playing retail WoW for the first time last weekend.  I made it to... Boralis?  I understand this to be a BfA quest line.  Is it worth it to continue?  Or should I wait until War Within and have my full first experience start in the Dragon Isles?
[0:55:59] jackjohny97: Static flying is so good when doing superbloom
[0:56:00] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming in Patch 10.2.5 "Seeds of Renewal" | Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/RVe32RozJGM
[0:56:07] Lausten: Dark Ranger should be the NPC you're looking for
[0:56:17] Implied_Slight: @jackjohny97 I logged into ptr just to test that. It feels so freeing to fly like superman Kreygasm

[0:56:30] BBMezzy: Are you sure? I had to buy them multiple times, they fixed it in a not announced hotfix so that it would actually remember you learning it
[0:56:48] Lausten: Shes near the entrance to the horde area if I remember correctly
[0:56:59] jackjohny97: Guys u remember cold weather flying🙉 holy  moly i just remembered that
[0:57:15] Lausten: Oh yeah you're Alliance, so its not a Dark Ranger LUL
[0:57:54] jackjohny97: @implied_slight yeah i love any game where you can fly like superman haha i feel u man 👌
[0:57:58] the_rethan_family: I remember what the player's feedback was on Jaina during Wrath.
[0:58:49] Lausten: The skinning ones are so crazy
[0:58:54] Harai_Ulfsark: i had already crafted a few of the stylin hats before the achievement :( ill need to craft those again

[0:59:16] snowyzoex: Doin gooood thanks, u?

[1:01:53] skewlbeta: the bear form that looks like the owl dudes
[1:01:55] the_rethan_family: I loved the moderate difficulty of the Icecrown dungeons when I started playing in Wrath.
[1:01:56] Kimdah_: Any snow where you’re at Dan? And if so, is it anything like the ‘snowbomb’ they ‘predicted’?
[1:01:58] fetza108: @jackjohny97 it is just boring
[1:02:01] JakeSezz: And I gotta be back at work today

[1:02:29] nyrhalahotep: Male bees have it rough, they just pollinate, mate, and then die, it's like; honey, nut, cheerio.
[1:02:47] Kimdah_: We got a thin layer of snow, more this evenong
[1:02:49] Puhg: Snow here.  Feeling super cozy this morning.  Scarf FTW.

[1:06:18] magemaster225: just had to get creative from lack of WoD content, xmog contests/all the RP questing
[1:06:22] ChrisStoll: Mostly people relating to his degen-lifestyle
[1:06:42] treavorthenusance: really weird to see him go from super elitest (i was as well) to more mellow (as i've become)
[1:06:59] Grissu_: I miss tmog contest, and mount offs tho Sadge

[1:22:02] jackjohny97: That part of dungeon was so scary back in the day
[1:22:04] fetza108: this was so cool when i first did
[1:22:15] SirBarracuda: Do you think they will ever add more dungeons to Timewalking? Here for example, it's a shame to only have 1 of the 3 ICC dungeons in the mix

[1:23:51] Jelky55: Danny boi, coffee preference? im curious LUL
[1:24:01] JakeSezz: Even though I’m sure realms won’t be up or it’ll be hella broken, I’m stoked to try Follower Dungeons when I get home from work
[1:24:05] Lausten: Think it was during Shadowlands to be honest
[1:24:07] Jelky55: black no milk no sugar yes?
[1:24:30] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:24:40] Elswyth_62: oat milk is lovely but pricey
[1:24:48] SirBarracuda: Oh I see, I must have forgotten that fact, either way, would be great for a bigger pool in general
[1:25:01] MediumRareOG: Achievement Unlocked: Levelled 10-60 in one sitting
[1:25:18] databob1: if I can get really good coffee I'll drink it black but that's rare
[1:25:21] JakeSezz: I have two coffees sitting here: one that is coffee with 3 shots of espresso, with cream & sugar and the other is an espresso drink with Irish cream. So I have about 6 or 7 total shots of espresso in front of me 😍
[1:25:59] MediumRareOG: I think that took 10-11 hours
[1:26:14] SirBarracuda: I only have instant in the house, weep for me.
[1:26:16] ladypharan: Hi just dropping by. Question on the retail ptr have u found any new grotto nether drake skins
[1:26:24] Jelky55: did u HSed too quick?
[1:26:26] BBMezzy: Maybe the RP needed to finish first?
[1:26:27] Jelky55: or ported
[1:26:29] JakeSezz: Yeah, normally it’s Bailey’s but since it’s coffee it’s more like a non-alcoholic version 😂
[1:26:38] planet2gamer: i think you need to wait the roleplay
[1:26:54] Jelky55: u got 1 mil gold , can i have some
[1:26:56] Jelky55: thx

[1:40:04] JakeSezz: @thunduz I don’t think he’s in here at the moment so it probably doesn’t count mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[1:40:18] Paranigmayt: will shut down the whole internet at home to get not spoilerd until i can play it myself :D

[1:41:00] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming in Patch 10.2.5 "Seeds of Renewal" | Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/RVe32RozJGM
[1:41:11] thunduz: I think you have a great point with having story content release all at the same time.
[1:41:42] planet2gamer: i think if we got a global release , we should also get a global maintance like , friday or something
[1:42:03] fooxytv: what if WoW did some world events similar to Fortnite? I would love that
[1:42:25] Zuldak: with Gilneus being reclaimed, another zone that we might see is Kazan for goblins?
[1:42:33] Jelky55: there she is <3
[1:42:35] Jelky55: :D
[1:42:40] skewlbeta: mrgmLuna mrgmLuna mrgmLuna mrgmLuna
[1:42:49] fooxytv: is that a herman miller chair?
[1:42:49] Larkaro: release the patch and then release the story a few days later when all servers are updated
[1:43:11] planet2gamer: @Larkaro its the better idea
[1:43:21] Shocklate_: morning gamers
[1:43:23] fooxytv: I was looking at one yesterday, is it worth it?
[1:43:35] marithered0203: Just done studying! Now time to relax and watch stream.. play some wow mrgmSmile
[1:43:39] planet2gamer: but still defends the global maintance , since it can also help in  global world first
[1:44:09] keyboardturner: kezan technically also has crapopolis now on it
[1:44:28] keyboardturner: it is
[1:44:54] fooxytv: I was looking at the logitech one, it's like £1.5k :O
[1:45:03] keyboardturner: though tbh i'm betting TWW is introducing something bigger for goblins, Undermine
[1:45:03] thunduz: remind me, war within early access does or does not have story attached.
[1:45:06] SinicalDev: Yo
[1:45:24] Jelky55: oh ye Kezan
[1:45:33] Jelky55: forgot about that zone

[1:47:01] thunduz: cat scratching the floors and one day kid drawing on the walls. yay!
[1:47:06] Zuldak: this place is terrible on heroic because heroic is a daily lockout
[1:47:28] Zuldak: legion VH is different
[1:47:34] Paranigmayt: you can get the first boss as you need by quitting the dungeon when the keeper is moving towards a portal
[1:47:39] SinicalDev: They should've done usable keys hidden around northrend that let you choose a boss, wouldve been so dope
[1:47:48] thurlingdrome: the trash drops are different between n and hc, but they are at least BoE

[1:56:38] Zuldak: heh i recently grinded out fishing up a broken wine bottle mace mog from northern barrens. Was...fun i think
[1:56:40] keyboardturner: if i could manage the willpower to stream i would do like 5 hour fishing streams
[1:57:13] TruVillainManny: Good Afternoon
[1:57:19] JakeSezz: I actually fished up a Sea Turtle mount over the weekend. Didn’t even know that was a thing 😂
[1:57:30] DocHogger: what is the fishing add-on called?
[1:57:53] marithered0203: I love that addon so much!
[1:57:54] TruVillainManny: Start of the day for me. The sea turtle was the bane of my existence as well
[1:58:19] keyboardturner: there's another addon that got released called Angleur but I think it has 1 thing where it pops up every login so i need to send feedback on that and it'd probably replace better fishing for me
[1:59:06] keyboardturner: it just pops up the fishing icon that shows a description every time you log in
[1:59:27] AdamShwaginz: that's a tweet
[1:59:31] ShineyFighter: i just wish it did it for the fishing hats.
[1:59:37] Harai_Ulfsark: would be so useful bc there are a lot of fishing items, like boots, hats, lines
[1:59:51] JakeSezz: That’d be dope as hell!
[2:00:06] TruVillainManny: I think they could definitely expand upon the transmog system to have the profession gear have customizable looks as well
[2:00:14] keyboardturner: also i think it doesn't have the double right click case option that better fihsing has, but it does let you automate queue up bobbers/fishing raft
[2:00:42] Larkaro: Luna is needy today lol
[2:01:34] awesomeoohh: for some reason i cant hear
[2:01:51] Harai_Ulfsark: sound is fine
[2:01:53] Larkaro: sounds great to me
[2:01:55] keyboardturner: muted forever
[2:02:02] keyboardturner: peepoGiggles
[2:02:02] lyreilla: I can hear
[2:02:14] Shocklate_: I hate watching back my own vod
[2:02:22] Harai_Ulfsark: im always pissed how the engineering gear was color swapped 😡
[2:02:29] bwoods79: no reason with herbalism already in the game we can't have dyes for gear
[2:02:32] Larkaro: I would love to be able to summon a fold out chair while i do fishing
[2:02:48] keyboardturner: you cna
[2:02:50] ShineyFighter: yes you can.
[2:02:55] Elswyth_62: you can there are 2 of them
[2:02:55] keyboardturner: there's 2 chairs i think
[2:03:05] ShineyFighter: its a TCG & a pandaria toy
[2:03:28] ShineyFighter: just need to do anglers dailys.
[2:03:37] bwoods79: you should be drinking while you are fishing...just saying
[2:03:40] bwoods79: in game
[2:03:41] snagprophet: Afternoon
[2:03:44] SinicalDev: Don't stop, the next cast will drop it for sure :)
[2:03:47] ShineyFighter: ah yeah nate thing.
[2:03:52] ShineyFighter: its just 4 fish.
[2:03:53] Larkaro: Well now I have to wait like 9 hours before i can go get a chair toy
[2:03:58] ShineyFighter: each day~
[2:04:18] Elswyth_62: you can get his rep from the garrison as well
[2:04:55] MediumRareOG: 84 weeks, 500 rep a pop
[2:05:00] Zuldak: another daily thing thats a good idea is to do the invasion portals on argus daily for those mogs
[2:05:05] ShineyFighter: you get the best fishing hat.
[2:05:15] Shocklate_: I thought Season 4 was gonna start today Sadge
[2:05:17] Harai_Ulfsark: no rewards... not even an achievement
[2:05:38] Harai_Ulfsark: season 3 just started KEKWAIT
[2:05:41] Grissu_: probably again all dungs from Df, and fated raids
[2:05:41] Shocklate_: I know, I've been living in SoDLand lately so ive been out of the loop KEKW
[2:06:03] ShineyFighter: nope
[2:06:07] Zuldak: no

[2:08:09] Paranigmayt: Work done for today. see us tomorrow Dan!
[2:08:14] neverbornlucky: MrGm  you know you could be playing raid shadow legends on SteamOS  while  fishing
[2:08:53] neverbornlucky: its just funny steam wants that mobile market
[2:09:33] Promilie: What are you fishing for?
[2:09:37] Zuldak: wow on steam would have issues with friends lists
[2:10:15] Zuldak: yeah i dont know how bnet integration would work
[2:10:19] neverbornlucky: key support without addon on steam would be fun for steam Deck
[2:10:21] Windelius: is this wrath dalaran or legion
[2:11:01] gorkamorka41782: @mrgm remember when Valve used to make their own games? When was that? 40 years ago?
[2:11:04] lithium364: im actually excited for the reclaiming of gilneas
[2:11:37] Harai_Ulfsark: portal 2 yeah
[2:12:09] isillytoy: @MrGM if wow went to steam i bet there would be steam only servers
[2:12:11] str4ysheep: half life alyx
[2:12:12] RentalPanda: half-life: alyx
[2:12:20] ShineyFighter: half life Alex
[2:12:29] ShineyFighter: alyx*
[2:12:30] Zuldak: Valve cant count to 3
[2:12:50] neverbornlucky: new mod in word I can't say that lets you turn unreal engine 4 games into that type of game
[2:13:00] Harai_Ulfsark: @isillytoy would be the same as FFXIV on steam, it opens the launcher for bnet/square enix
[2:13:03] Zuldak: team fortress 2, half life 2, Dota2, portal 2...
[2:13:16] Zuldak: left 4 dead 2
[2:13:40] Layliah79: yes
[2:13:41] calphan84: yeah
[2:13:44] MuuskeWoW: na is down
[2:13:46] WoWRoach: Yes NA just booted me
[2:14:03] Layliah79: 7am
[2:14:06] neverbornlucky: too cold in texas to think of servers being down
[2:14:07] lithium364: hope they have some sweet rewards for the gilneas quest
[2:14:07] Lestatis: lol
[2:14:10] Roflrobbie: you just made my siri go off too haha
[2:14:15] xwowkillax: alexa Wut
[2:14:21] Zuldak: im in oregon which is just north of Cali
[2:14:41] snagprophet: Astoria?
[2:14:43] Zuldak: its -8 here. cold as balls
[2:14:46] Zuldak: Salem
[2:14:46] snagprophet: oh Portland
[2:14:54] Zuldak: Portland is the big city but Salem is the capitol
[2:15:05] snagprophet: its like how Sacramento is California capital
[2:15:27] snagprophet: and Kansas City isnt even in Kansas
[2:15:35] isillytoy: @MrGM i think steam i content to let people do there own sorys in portal 2 right now
[2:15:41] ShineyFighter: i just started.
[2:15:44] TalkingWalnuts: Does EU not go down for service same time as NA?
[2:15:52] skewlbeta: @Zuldak I used to live in West Salem!
[2:16:13] WolfSpirit80: isn't the EU patch tomorrow?

[2:16:51] TruVillainManny: Considering US servers are down until 3 PST, this will be a long day.
[2:17:06] goekenaitor: and i have the day off
[2:17:15] Xara36: yeah because they figure it all out on the US server
[2:17:21] Xara36: i mean thats obvious
[2:17:30] snagprophet: yeah EU reset is at 2/3am and we never experience servers down
[2:17:49] TruVillainManny: The long down time must be to test stability and fine-tune. I assume once they have a working template they just copy that over to the other regions.
[2:17:57] keyboardturner: us has now had patch applied to servers
[2:18:01] MuuskeWoW: NA are our testers
[2:18:01] keyboardturner: it begins
[2:18:02] Xara36: with our longer downtimes, its not even a day later lol it's like 8 hours later lol
[2:18:14] TruVillainManny: NA servers are now down
[2:18:18] keyboardturner: algalon slow
[2:18:53] HatchlingMiquela: i'm willing to bet it will be 6-7pm and not 3pm
[2:18:58] keyboardturner: @ghostopholes
[2:19:04] TruVillainManny: 447 mb seems not the worst
[2:19:09] keyboardturner: i think i tagged some random guy KEKW
[2:19:14] TalkingWalnuts: anyone know why such a long down time?
[2:19:19] funviking99: !emote
[2:19:24] TalkingWalnuts: awful timing since im having a snow day today.
[2:19:28] WolfSpirit80: 1.5 GB to me
[2:19:35] databob1: !emote DinoDance
[2:19:49] Vesamora: yeah mine is 1.5 too
[2:19:53] TruVillainManny: I must have most info from ptr data
[2:20:16] Vesamora: Always an overachiever
[2:20:20] databob1: ouch
[2:20:47] TruVillainManny: I got to test stuff!
[2:21:18] goekenaitor: same Walnuts
[2:21:22] databob1: !emote DinoDance

[2:22:06] TalkingWalnuts: update queued and done. servers still down. sadge
[2:22:16] WolfSpirit80: !emote sentHype
[2:22:20] TruVillainManny: Now to hope we see 10.2.6 this week as well. Though if I were to bet I would put it over to next week being available for testing.
[2:23:18] keyboardturner: Okayge
[2:23:52] Layliah79: datamining will happen soon right? for today's patch.
[2:24:14] neverbornlucky: oh my God I just logged into NA saw the biggest DRAGON ever

[2:24:46] Layliah79: i highly doubt they will be down for as long as it says
[2:24:57] Layliah79: it's not a raid patch.
[2:25:02] Layliah79: 3pm PST
[2:25:03] timex1: 8hrs

[2:26:41] keyboardturner: thaldraszus
[2:26:54] lithium364: i think thats the cryastlized black dragon we free during the evoker augmentation prolog?
[2:27:06] lithium364: in the forbidden reach
[2:27:07] the_rethan_family: What do you think if Worgen got clothes (or lack of) as part of character customisation. With an option to prioritize either proper gear or those new clothes. Maybe even add the option to hide weapons on them.
[2:27:39] keyboardturner: sometimes stuff like fires and trees and other objects get deleted from minimap bakes
[2:27:44] lithium364: hide weapons is a must have for worgen, people have been asking for that since worgen came out
[2:28:23] keyboardturner: fire
[2:28:29] Implied_Slight: looks like flames
[2:28:32] the_rethan_family: isn't it the pase of the new rep?

[2:29:50] keyboardturner: fixed what
[2:29:57] lithium364: man i love the gilneas music
[2:29:58] lyreilla: Whoop Whoop!
[2:30:44] the_rethan_family: great, now I need to return to the exodar to check for any updates -.-
[2:31:35] TruVillainManny: Yeah it's the same build as live and they shut off the encryption and now you can go nuts
[2:32:25] MachoCham: Is it Friday yet?
[2:33:09] Layliah79: SPOILERS!!! :D
[2:33:18] ShineyFighter: this on US relms?
[2:33:21] Layliah79: X marks the spot!
[2:33:29] MachoCham: Ok, you have my interest
[2:33:37] the_rethan_family: as a good european boy, I will go to bed tonight and wake up on tons of new lore-revelations^^
[2:33:42] TruVillainManny: Are you thinking they might carry this forward into the profession?
[2:33:48] kahdia_: is this coming with tonight's update!?
[2:34:05] kahdia_: that looks so cool
[2:34:14] Layliah79: i bet that micro holiday was a test for this new event
[2:34:37] Implied_Slight: they killed them D:
[2:34:48] BBMezzy: That's been there since 10.0
[2:34:52] Implied_Slight: this will be the last time they drink my tea
[2:35:15] ShineyFighter: sporkyLOL sporkyLOL sporkyLOL sporkyLOL
[2:36:03] MachoCham: Feels like it could be
[2:36:07] Layliah79: Old archeology is still there right?
[2:36:14] Iwony: aloha Dan

[2:36:33] the_rethan_family: Darn, all the encripted NPC that were in the Exodar are still gone. Maybe it was supposed to be early stuff for a future patch.
[2:37:17] Iwony: uhm PTR ?  cause I am pretty sure it is tuesday /not patch day in EU today^^
[2:37:26] lupecci11: Its like that Kyrian quest . The forging one.
[2:37:43] MachoCham: Looks like you need to move through it
[2:38:11] MachoCham: You want to keep it in the middle bit I guess
[2:39:25] the_rethan_family: are there any lore-relevant parts to the new excavation content?
[2:40:29] skewlbeta: it is what it is smh
[2:40:33] Shocklate_: they are a small indie studio, give them a break OMEGALUL
[2:40:38] skewlbeta: it's a secret lol
[2:40:55] Larkaro: intern forgot to add the txt file
[2:40:58] skewlbeta: I had to take a work call but saw that there are still secrets in Gilneas, right?
[2:41:39] Killdozer77: Are they really limiting the follower dungeons to 10 per day?  That makes no sense.  How is it ensuring a smooth experience for all if it only affects one person?
[2:41:46] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: i 'm downloading the patch but then have to wait for the servers to come back online
[2:42:21] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[2:42:41] slambitz: staff
[2:42:50] MachoCham: If a solo dungeon takes you 20min to complete, it's over 3 hours to hit the daily cap of dungeons
[2:42:51] skewlbeta: 100% this is new archaeology
[2:42:59] Layliah79: can u mount while doing that?
[2:43:07] MachoCham: Is anyone going to run them THAT much with the low XP gains?
[2:43:30] Implied_Slight: most casual players probably won't even hit the 10 run cap every day
[2:43:37] Layliah79: hope they didn't remove the old archeology. using dragonriding to finish up some achievements.
[2:43:51] MachoCham: And the casual players are the demographic for the dungeons
[2:43:52] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:43:52] the_rethan_family: I hope, with how fast players can fly now, that Blizzard gives all old rares 30sec of invulnerability. It is really annoying when you se a rare on your map and you know you won't make it there before it dies.
[2:43:56] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: is Gilneas on the PTR or they still didnt show the quest chain
[2:44:44] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: i really want to check out Bel'Amenth then do the Gilneas quest chain and see what happens
[2:44:45] Layliah79: KEKW
[2:45:00] BBMezzy: Typical WoW accident
[2:45:18] slambitz: perpetuating the hunter stereo type, i just shot everything, why's that so bad :D
[2:45:59] Layliah79: i got a new download in WOW!
[2:46:00] slambitz: LUL
[2:46:01] Elrathir: LUL whoops
[2:46:17] Layliah79: must be the patch.
[2:46:20] WolfSpirit80: Do you think the new Hearthstone disc mount will be from the Hearthstone anniversary event?
[2:46:27] Layliah79: yes
[2:47:20] MarkSterlingESQ: wait how are you playing I thought servers were down?
[2:47:33] MarkSterlingESQ: oh wait EU
[2:47:42] MachoCham: Streamer Privilege
[2:47:44] MarkSterlingESQ: ah yeah
[2:47:46] neverbornlucky: servers are always up in my pants
[2:47:51] Vesamora: The offline realm list shows up for NA now, so it could either come up in 30 minutes or sit here like this for 8 hours.
[2:47:54] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: he gets a day later
[2:48:03] Vesamora: So it went from "no realms available" to the offline list.
[2:48:26] kahdia_: @Vesamora that would've been a really quick maintenance for an update damn
[2:48:36] Vesamora: I'm camping the server list because I have no life, I'll yell if they come up
[2:48:41] TalkingWalnuts: TLDR is it Archeology or Not? haha
[2:48:43] the_rethan_family: I really hope that with Midnight, they will update the dragonhawk model. It's weird how they have their own pet family and had zero additions in  decades.
[2:48:55] TalkingWalnuts: dang.
[2:48:58] planet2gamer: @Vesamora thanks for the favor
[2:49:04] TalkingWalnuts: big missed opportunity. i loved Arch.
[2:49:05] kahdia_: @Vesamora thank you for your service haha
[2:49:33] BBMezzy: maybe wind to dry it?
[2:50:21] kahdia_: might as well be a shit, many animals are around thereç
[2:50:30] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: i;m stuck at 99 % what the hell
[2:50:43] Layliah79: he have a face too?
[2:50:47] Layliah79: oh he does!
[2:51:06] Layliah79: he's cute! new battle pet incoming :D
[2:51:22] Mistyveil: that hat is adorable lol
[2:51:34] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: WoW loves them pooh quests
[2:51:45] the_rethan_family: Ever heard Turalion's voicelines in german? He is meant to say "My faith is my shield" but pronounces it so hard that he ends up saying "My faith is my shit."
[2:51:55] Implied_Slight: scatman
[2:52:06] Shocklate_: OMEGALUL
[2:52:10] Calicice12: bggHaa
[2:52:12] Implied_Slight: that turtle one shot you
[2:52:14] Vesamora: ??
[2:52:15] Layliah79: @Implied_Slight now i have that song in my head
[2:52:15] HeyKairhys: RIP
[2:52:15] Elrathir: absolutely taken down
[2:52:18] planet2gamer: died to a turtle
[2:52:22] Poor_GuY69: LUL
[2:52:29] MachoCham: git fuked
[2:52:30] adampanerabread: i have 1hp LUL
[2:52:32] Mistyveil: lmao
[2:52:35] the_rethan_family: such is the power of a turtle that made it to the water.
[2:52:35] ShineyFighter: sporkyPop bad doggie
[2:52:43] planet2gamer: the turtle power is real
[2:53:01] kahdia_: yeah now it says you have 1hp
[2:53:10] adampanerabread: you have 1hp now LUL
[2:53:13] adampanerabread: yea
[2:53:43] Chesscape: is this the long awaited retail hardcore mode?
[2:54:07] Layliah79: We (NA) are the guinea pigs anyways for all new content
[2:54:30] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:54:32] the_rethan_family: for the longest time, you got 10'000% your max HP in the PTR, so that your real health was 1% and even the smallest falling damage killed you.
[2:55:38] the_rethan_family: a centaur corpse? are we excavating or grave-robbing?
[2:55:42] KrathiumWoW: I prefer RuneScape's version of arch tbh much more relaxed
[2:56:12] BBMezzy: This seems like something that could break quite easily when more than 1 or 2 players are doing it.. I'd still rather this type of content be tested on PTR instead of be encrypted

[2:57:07] jskillz777: i think they need more time
[2:57:08] MachoCham: I hope it comes over to retail KEKW
[2:57:23] Elrathir: gonna be exciting when the much anticipated gilneas questline arrives fully broken Kappa
[2:57:26] MachoCham: The HP bug
[2:57:29] Implied_Slight: hope there are new world quests. more is always good.

[3:07:22] the_rethan_family: This questline to unlock it all feels like an extreme bottle-neck. I imagine that many players will be annoyed with eachother.

[3:27:38] NelsonGamingShow: sup nerds
[3:28:06] Vanderlong: Is this NA?

[3:34:37] Harai_Ulfsark: oh, maybe they updated the model for all red foxes?
[3:34:40] keyboardturner: i remember seeing somebody piss angery that they were this style of fox rather than the old model
[3:34:59] snagprophet: its the shdaowlands fox model
[3:35:06] chelfx: Bless you
[3:35:23] keyboardturner: mention shadowlands or any assets from shadowlands and people start foaming at the mouth
[3:35:26] Harai_Ulfsark: maybe they dont have a blue shadowlands fox model?

[3:36:52] Larkaro: yes
[3:36:53] Lausten: She went back
[3:37:08] Archiduss: Malfurion in power level is also one of the most powerful beings on Azeroth. Its annoying how sidelined he has been since forever.
[3:37:12] Lausten: So naturally he comes back
[3:37:12] endobleedz: does everyone get legos today
[3:37:19] NeeK_23: uninformed twitter comments?? im shocked
[3:37:20] Harai_Ulfsark: there was no reason tho, we had people from ardenweald coming to emerald dream anyway
[3:37:32] endobleedz: well we should lol
[3:37:34] snagprophet: I was confused why they didnt have him do anything in the Emerald Dream patch
[3:37:36] Harai_Ulfsark: they didnt do anything, but they were there still
[3:37:46] Archiduss: I want to see Malfurion kick ass as a Druid main.

[3:41:13] fooxytv: you have a lot to go yet, terrible 2's be prepared
[3:41:23] thunderioum: you dont ask a wow player "how old is she now?" you ask "whats her /play? "
[3:41:27] Lausten: Thanks for beta testing for EU
[3:41:45] tbaile10: 2 was the easiest with my kid but 3 was soul crushing
[3:42:04] Larkaro: 2 years old is when you can RKO her
[3:42:08] chelfx: I know this may be weird but i would love too see what they do and why during server maintenance
[3:42:10] tbaile10: just a needy kid
[3:42:11] endobleedz: 6 1/2hrs
[3:43:02] Lausten: I mean, they are probably taking backups as well and shit
[3:43:04] michaelmm: They have to install the server software then run a load of scripts to convert data.
[3:43:04] lyreilla: Sometimes they just pass out, but usually they get super cranky when their that tired so you get them to bed before the "just pass out on floor" stage. LOL
[3:43:15] chelfx: Key is 1234
[3:43:36] michaelmm: One of the server engineers did a presentation to GDC back in wod times that explained a lot of what they do.
[3:43:45] thunderioum: probably the gilneas cinematic
[3:43:48] CloudyHS: thanks for the gifted sub while i wasnt even in the stream
[3:43:58] NelsonGamingShow: i have the key: LMAOCUTSCEN420
[3:44:01] NeeK_23: as someone who works in software dev testing, rollouts typically involve waiting and praying that nothing breaks everything despite the countless hours of teting you did
[3:44:34] fooxytv: I remember a blizzcon where the engineers discussed silly stories etc I forgot which one it was now
[3:44:44] EmuIow: Hey bud! Have the Twitter giveaway winners been announced already? ^-^

[3:49:29] nyrhalahotep: what would a ladybug sound like? How about; REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
[3:50:06] tbaile10: so Gilneas is still encrypted or am I just behind the times
[3:50:20] Lausten: What does the lady bug say? catJAM
[3:50:39] Vesamora: NA realm list still says offline so I guess we're leaning toward the 8 hour estimate than the 30 minute estimate lol
[3:51:08] NelsonGamingShow: bro he cheating

[3:57:40] keyboardturner: i only get weirded out and annoyed when people who block me do that but idk
[3:59:15] Haestoh: As a proper writer and reporter surely you should know to link your sources.
[3:59:18] Haestoh: at the very least
[3:59:29] keyboardturner: wait i've missed something is dave greco known for doing something bad
[3:59:58] Haestoh: They used Chinglish's commisson
[4:00:03] michaelmm: With wowhead being owned by a largish company they will get more scrutiny.
[4:00:04] keyboardturner: oh ok
[4:00:06] Haestoh: I mean PandaTV
[4:00:31] mrsrockguru: what's that
[4:00:34] gorkamorka41782: @mrgm  on the subject of Devs knowing about things in advance. I have an artist friend who one day told me to send a picture of my best "dead" me face. Months later he showed me the art for Dead of Winter" in Magic the Gathering. And bam, there I am in the bottom left of the finished art. Frozen and dead
[4:01:54] Haestoh: In the RDR2 RP server I was part of making. One of my dev friends made an NPC named after my mum mrgmZ
[4:02:34] bwoods79: With valentine's day coming I remember saying they are upping the drop rate of the rocket didn't they? So probably going to see them everywhere
[4:03:00] skewlbeta: they added a bunch of doors to gilneas. Not sure if you saw that. Weird
[4:03:14] Haestoh: Yes, RanchRP the RDR2 RP server. We launched it back in 2022 and there's a random RP that walks around named after my Mum
[4:03:27] Haestoh: a random NP
[4:03:29] Haestoh: NPC
[4:03:34] skewlbeta: Not sure lol. I never noticed them before but in the main market area you can open the doors to almost all the buildings in the square
[4:03:58] Chesscape: those doors are for the starting quests there
[4:04:00] Haestoh: You hard of NoPixel?
[4:04:03] Haestoh: the GTA RP server?
[4:04:07] Haestoh: heard*
[4:04:13] HeyyyHali: good morning dan!
[4:04:20] Haestoh: It's like a RDR2 version of that
[4:05:03] HeyyyHali: doin alright friend, just waiting on NA servers vthaliFine
[4:05:44] HeyyyHali: another 6 hours mrgmLUL
[4:05:49] Haestoh: So the RP servers use 3rd party launcher called FiveM that allows devs to make "private" servers with custom npcs, job roles, actions, scripts ect.
[4:06:23] Haestoh: Yeh FiveM was bought by Rockstar last year
[4:06:24] HeyyyHali: ratstallion isn't terrible if you have friends tbh. you can just keep killing each other over and over until you have the currency
[4:06:28] chelfx: Yes r* bought them
[4:06:54] Haestoh: NoPixel is the biggest FiveM GTA server
[4:07:00] chefdejour82: invited im sure
[4:07:03] skewlbeta: Can also kill rares to get the currencyt
[4:07:12] Haestoh: for like streamers and creators
[4:07:16] chelfx: NoPixel  you have to be invited
[4:07:23] tbaile10: you can get the tokens without pvp but it takes forever
[4:07:35] chelfx: Pretty much
[4:07:40] grimzero617: Morning Dan, morning chat. I've been frozen in my house for the past few days, but that gave me the time to finally finish A Tour of Towers achievement and get my spelltome mount
[4:07:42] chelfx: most big Rp servers are
[4:08:07] hectorian01: Hi!! I saw your tweet from earlier. Is the patch already out?!
[4:08:21] keyboardturner: it was very weird seeing one of the bigger streamers i watch Vinesauce be on a shared stream event that Esfand was on, since i consider them basically totally different worlds
[4:08:24] Haestoh: They have a "Whitelist" process where you have to apply for the server and go through an "interview" to see if your quality of RP is up to standard.
[4:08:27] Molly336: @grimzero617 gz!!
[4:08:31] Haestoh: for some of the more serious servers
[4:09:01] NeeK_23: weird, but doesnt matter now someone else said how to get the mount
[4:09:05] Layliah79: GTA RP streamers make bank
[4:09:11] HeyyyHali: if you messed around with your moderation settings recently, it's probably holding more messages than usual
[4:09:19] OrthiadNick: They create a scene and see how you react on it probably
[4:09:26] JakeSezz: You can upload clips of previous RP streams and that sort of thing
[4:09:54] JakeSezz: If I had more time, I would probably do GTA RP. Looks like hella crazy fun
[4:09:56] Haestoh: I could blow your mind with the stupid conversations I had to moderation from player reports against one another for bad RP or RDM or Meta gaming. RP world is a wild one
[4:10:42] User3600: Thats why we need "Player Housing"
[4:10:44] WochiTV: hello there
[4:10:53] Layliah79: characters
[4:11:02] WochiTV: all very good thanks
[4:11:08] Crimzon7: It's already big depending on what server you go to
[4:11:15] skewlbeta: it's hard I think because it's all writing based, so unless you have someone who would voice act.
[4:11:19] Haestoh: WoW RP is massive. a lot of GTA and RDR2 RPers started text based in WoW and other MMO’s.
[4:11:25] chelfx: The stuff they have done in these rp servers are crazy, EMT have full on systems to heal and tend to people

[4:15:06] keyboardturner: there's a very real possibility ai text to speech will be available in WoW soon if microsoft supports it in their default TTS program
[4:15:09] Larkaro: perfect spelling
[4:15:14] chelfx: and i dont think wow can do that
[4:15:27] ZellieMoogle: Hai all <3 oo fishing!
[4:15:31] DeadSeriousTV: Prox chat is fun in most games (obv toxic people excluded)
[4:16:11] keyboardturner: yeah the WoW TTS is just a thing that's pulled from windows TTS, I have an addon I made that can read quest text and stuff with it
[4:16:14] Haestoh: RDR2 RP is so much better than GTA. Obviously because it’s a newer game, but also the community is better because not everyone wants to be “gangster”

[4:22:55] PurplePenguinGamer: Theres a lot of addons that were great and the addon developers nope-d out out playing the game so they sit as a relic of the past

[4:48:05] chelfx: Cata had some really fun raids
[4:48:28] JakeSezz: Part of my problem is that I have SO many interests, I never knew how to do them all in a fulfilling way. Shit didn’t really start working out for me til I joined the Navy, and I was 34 when that happened
[4:48:37] Iwony: can you tell me what this achievment is called you are doing I cannot remember if I have ever done that one...

[4:51:03] Layliah79: wondering if they are for collecting the warlock and druid appearances!
[4:51:22] JakeSezz: Coding is BRUTAL, imo. Like the amount of attention to detail is too much for me lmao
[4:51:58] Layliah79: except tier tokens :(

[4:53:21] Mistyveil: unless its a flying horse 😆
[4:53:23] adampanerabread: the world quest unlock is account wide & you can see them on the map on your alts, but the npcs aren't actually there
[4:53:30] Layliah79: maybe it's those dog mounts!
[4:54:09] Larkaro: maybe i'll wait a day to play the new patch

[5:02:50] Hayely: People still do those groups at times
[5:02:59] Layliah79: could prob in Wow Achievements discord who would need it too
[5:03:07] Layliah79: *find people in that discord

[5:05:40] Mordotzz: cus its like something u farmed for and items have become less and less special unless its super grindy to get
[5:05:44] JakeSezz: I think it’s because of just how damn difficult it was to get certain items
[5:05:45] funviking99: crucible something LUL LUL
[5:05:48] chelfx: T10 for dk was scourgelord
[5:05:56] JakeSezz: @mistyveil truuuuuue!

[5:06:27] chefdejour82: well in vanilla alot more people competing over something with 40 people
[5:06:28] throbbers: Things are not unique anymore sometimes they are impactful when they create a meme like slivers in bfa
[5:06:34] DeadSeriousTV: Neltharax the much sought after box
[5:06:34] buMf00d: everybody remembers skullflame shield or krol blade

[5:06:39] DeadSeriousTV: bow even
[5:06:43] krusty_claps: ngl as a newer player i don't have that problem
[5:06:56] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[5:06:56] Babayn: Not heroic?
[5:07:11] chelfx: i think its also because we are older players we dont look at item names

[5:08:03] fooxytv: I see Cata has WoW 2
[5:08:06] Harai_Ulfsark: there's also that sword with an epic name from shadowlands that just had the most generic oribos look, poxstorm, long sword of pestilence
[5:08:06] Larkaro: Did someone say Thunderfurry, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
[5:08:08] chelfx: Other than trinkets rest of the loot just has stats and thats wht people care about
[5:08:18] x1mmortal_: as someone who watches ur YT vids alot, glad i can finally catch a stream love the content
[5:08:19] Molly336: i would die

[5:08:25] Implied_Slight: season of discovery is like a realm reborn tbh
[5:08:29] Molly336: and NEVER open wow again
[5:08:33] SlithTheSivak: @MrGM  do u think that if Azeroth, the titan, is born, it will destroy the planet? if so, where do u think we would "go" from there?
[5:08:35] DeadSeriousTV: If they reset my collection I'd never play again
