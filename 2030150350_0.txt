[3:14:44] Arroow_: @Liryaa fo survivability generally yes, but if u have skilled into ascending flames, you can overlap to have 2 charges for more dmg or 2x 15% parry so 30%
[3:15:16] rhaenji_gaming: Why is Zaelia not streaming?
[3:15:19] yujik46: @Arroow_ the parry chance doesnt stack when u overlap SoF

[3:15:51] Arroow_: with 1 it only shows 15%
[3:15:53] yujik46: @Arroow_ yeah its a tooltip bug it doesnt actually stack
[3:16:08] Arroow_: that is yikes from blizzard then
[3:16:09] Liryaa: @Arroow_ Okay thanks, will try
[3:16:58] Arroow_: to track Fear/Chains sigil in the CC part of your omnicd, what do i have to change? i can put Silence Sigil in, but ticking one of the other 2 sigils, they just go into the row next to the party frame instead of the CC tracker

[5:04:53] wazuupp: yep exactly i amn't saying that they shouldn't play with priest just pointing that monk would be better
[5:05:10] Nuitsible: we just speaking of optimizing spec not players
[5:05:12] rpgonlyforme: The main thing I've seen as a weakness of monk is that cocoon is a really bad external.  PS is far better.
[5:05:24] pranders1: what?
[5:05:28] pranders1: cocoon is huge
[5:05:31] wazuupp: :D
[5:05:46] rpgonlyforme: Nerf specifically complains that it absorbs very little inc dam

[8:47:16] zombiown: yeah but i mean do i have to kill fyrakk LFR > Normal then hc  so i get 3 greater essences or what
[8:47:17] WalterBishop: lot of it was aoe
[8:48:38] shananiswe: @zombiown nah best is just ot kill fyrakk on hc if you dont do mythic
[8:48:43] shananiswe: not the other diffs
[8:48:45] zombiown: why
[8:49:01] zombiown: if i do hc then nm and then lfr i only get 1 greater essence from first kill
[8:49:04] zombiown: vice versa u get 3
[8:49:14] zombiown: @Naowh help master
[8:49:26] N4shie: doing hc is the same as doing lfr, normal and hc
[8:49:38] N4shie: the greater essence you get from lower difficulties give less BLP
[8:49:52] zombiown: link source
[8:50:10] N4shie: its in their bluepost from when the weapon was released and on wowhead
[8:50:35] zombiown: it said the drop rate for doing hc instead of lower difficulties and then hc is the same
[8:50:42] zombiown: but nothing about the greater essences
[8:51:22] naro1089: @zombiown you can waste your time and clear each difficulty if it makes you feel better, but doing heroic is the same as doing all 3 difficullties

[8:59:42] zombiown: @Naowh Quick legendary axe question: Is it better to clear Fyrakk in LFR then Normal then HC to get 3 greater essences or no? Does that increase the drop rate compared to doing Hc  Fyrakk only?
[8:59:58] Vinciwow: if u update ur WA for dps when do we get the updates?
[9:00:23] zombiown: @Naowh but if u do Hc first u dont get essences for following NM and LFR kills
