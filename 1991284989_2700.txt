[3:22:45] neftario105: @sqknarf Tank lock u must be Demonology check WoWHead
[3:23:34] sqknarf: @neftario105 i just checked one, not all of them are going to have the same talent points, you at least want the extra stam from demo. from there id says its players choice

[3:26:50] sqknarf: @GodKingMuninn isnt the 10% move a combo gernerator? and the other the spender?

[3:32:01] Verdell263: Really curious how Healing Mage will be
[3:32:05] GodKingMuninn: @sqknarf So Deadly, Brew, Blade Danse, and Just a flesh wound. This version would be higher dam, more tick per second but 10% less parry on onccasion
[3:32:06] Leelo4673: not played wow for ages. not even played wow classic. I’m tempted to try for SoM
[3:32:24] neftario105: @verdell263  play one

[3:33:40] cyrex172: it would have been cool if they gave all the blizzard characters stats on the back of the cards
[3:33:51] Verdell263: @neftario105 I think so. It "should" play like a combo resto D/disc
[3:34:06] MattyNiceTV: do you know which server you're going to be on for SoD?
[3:34:15] sqknarf: @sqknarf in my case i would probably stick with the 10% parry to be safe, we still dont know how hard things are going to hit since its been adjusted for new areas and abilities
