[0:57:31] riggzgg: I realized that as I sent it
[0:57:39] stiiiiles: because we are watching the game/playing the game ourselves
[0:57:53] Myuri_: wows a chill game
[0:58:10] riggzgg: Is Wow Classic the better version of wow to play on?
[0:58:20] sonadapop: lets all spam POG and gg ez once the fight is over okay?
[0:58:21] stiiiiles: @riggzgg no its harder and more grindy
[0:58:26] Vronning: maybe shoot down some pyrite before encounter
[0:58:32] wixxastream: who was that seige spinning in a circle not interuppting flame vents? god tier gamer right there

[0:58:51] riggzgg: What harder about it?
[0:58:54] xwalonosx: both are fun, one is an initial grind that leads to raid logging
[0:58:58] AloftPanda: Is the plan to go into Mythic on reset?
[0:58:58] stiiiiles: @riggzgg requires more grind
[0:59:09] riggzgg: Ah, I got it now
[0:59:10] xwalonosx: the other is a lot harder endgame
[0:59:10] Rofiki: Hey @shroud !

[1:01:37] blackenHH: Shroud do you do coaching
[1:02:10] johnveejv: @xwalonosx I mean, the one with harder endgame would be retail? I've just joined on DF, never really tried classic so no idea on classic endgame.
[1:02:38] sonadapop: i wouldnt say wotlk is "harder". its just that the game has outdated ui and raid mechanics that aren't explained to you
[1:02:38] xwalonosx: oh retail endgame is like 10x classics in terms of difficulty.
[1:02:43] xwalonosx: yeah

[1:06:38] fpfpx: @runosrevenge ull figure it out as u play. u only have a few skills early lvls
[1:06:44] Caddywhomp: @runosrevenge You start off with only 2-3 buttons/skills and then slowly gain more over time. It only looks overwhelming because you're looking at a max lvl char with all abilities
[1:06:46] sonadapop: @Vronning KEKW
[1:07:03] Realskeel: @Vronning of course people one shot everything, its not that hard

Its a very general macro and is not optimized at all for specific situations. Manually doing your rotations will always perform better at higher levels

[4:19:59] DazyDreamz: PERSEVERANCE
[4:20:01] MysticalOS: @Its_Chr15 every time someone dies, he heals, and he does debuffs that one shot tanks after x seconds, so the dps check is to do more damage than he heals factoring those tank deaths, without anyone else dying

[4:23:25] ChubbyMikey: anyone that ever thinks retail updates will finish on time deserves too languish in the purgatory of down servers

[4:24:09] cass2quick: my guild makes us prepot on everything, if u dont use a certain amount of pots per attempt  it counts against u in loot counsil
[4:24:15] Guenhyvar_: pretty sure they still have the burn in issue
[4:24:20] tidy_cats_marketing: @cass2quick yikes
[4:24:20] JDK1_8: Oled is for work only
[4:24:21] hikazey: Whatever has the best response rate baby
[4:24:21] Karduar: i bought an OLED and cant tell the difference from my regular 4k.  maybe a tiny bit better darks...but thats not big need for me
[4:24:22] MysticalOS: i feel like the push will move toward more mini led zones and eventually micro led, since oleds drawbacks are sub optimal
[4:24:23] cCOBEe: isnt oled mobile tech
[4:24:24] warmsteak: Sounds like you need a new guild @cass2quick
[4:24:26] Darkcrafts_: Mau5 Mau5

[4:25:21] cptpissmeoffguy: Who ever made this music lineup would have been my best friend in highschool
[4:25:22] Zurizuraw: oled have image quality, besides normal eye do not see much difference between 144vs240+ and on IPS vs oled does

[4:25:48] hmks4: @cass2quick think he's just saying for this fight specifically, prepotting doesn't make a huge diff cause real fight only starts on last boss. prepotting normally good
[4:25:51] tidy_cats_marketing: everyone knows you need 360hz to play WoW, you're inting if not
[4:25:51] Wongolian: You have no idea about OLED monitors then
[4:25:51] kreamypi: shroud ur hot
[4:25:52] kiTTiponX11: NODDERS  NODDERS  NODDERS
[4:25:52] badnater6: is this classic wow @shroud
[4:25:55] MysticalOS: i don't think oled is going anywehre, it's just for a different kind of professional, artists, videophiles, etc.
[4:26:00] malarkey0094: @hikazey shroud has a proble with everything lol
[4:26:06] iainbrux: song is H A R D
[4:26:07] sgtshellshocka: can you expand on your opinion
[4:26:07] shin_hong: its def more a tv thingÔºånot gaming monitors
[4:26:12] diadem_op: ye
[4:26:17] Kingcon54: !ui
[4:26:18] StreamElements: @Kingcon54, he's using a modified version of atrocity's UI shroudYEP
[4:26:29] EarlGraye: @issnate nah servers are down
[4:26:36] flawlesslykun: @shroud true HDR is the reason
[4:26:37] MysticalOS: but i also think as mini led comes down, and microled improves, oled long term will phase out.
[4:26:41] flawlesslykun: and it looks gorgeous
[4:26:41] Camrock__: whats good FPS for PVE WoW content? 60? 90?
[4:26:42] badnater6: @EarlGraye what is this then
[4:26:43] Bradunderscore: behind is subjective
[4:26:45] iainbrux: All I want is 2K 24inch again Madge
[4:26:46] ChubbyMikey: it's still fantastic for gaming, unless you are (or like most of chat, THINK you are) in the competitive scene
[4:26:46] Nepoxui: behind on fps but not on picture quality
[4:26:49] hikazey: I think people want it for the viewing experience
[4:26:51] cCOBEe: Oled was on like PS vita 11 years ago and still not much
[4:26:53] Nepoxui: wtf so lame
[4:26:56] cCOBEe: because it burns in
[4:27:01] EarlGraye: @issnate really think about your question OMEGALUL
[4:27:04] tidy_cats_marketing: !remindme 300 months
[4:27:06] bigbigbuckz: how many wipes chat ?
[4:27:11] badnater6: @EarlGraye ????
[4:27:19] hikazey: I've counted 3-4 wipes so far
[4:27:19] ItzZebo: Not everyone needs high Hz since not everyone is a comp player
[4:27:21] shin_hong: 5 years later shroud still streaming wow
[4:27:24] hikazey: But there are more I think
[4:27:34] Camrock__: REALMS UP{!!!!
[4:27:40] EarlGraye: atpRtsd4
[4:27:40] MysticalOS: @cCOBEe that has been massively improved over years with auto pixel refreshing and other tech, but the bigger issue is it's organic material, burn in or not, it uses color accuracy over time, especially organic material used for blue
[4:27:45] Wongolian: Been running OLED since 2020 with zero issues. They're finally getting more mainstream.
[4:27:47] hipsi85: someone already potted DansGame
[4:27:47] emptyherolol: !weakaura
[4:27:54] hikazey: what about QLED
[4:28:01] kevtheaverage: burn in isnt bad alot of them have settings to avoid it also
[4:28:13] PavaVW: wait.. shroud is a ret paladin?
[4:28:18] iDaddii: Has Twitch been acting up the past couple weeks? Cause the past few streams have been acting wonky
[4:28:19] kevtheaverage: but oled will just be for the people who care more about graphics
[4:28:20] PavaVW: oh dear
[4:28:26] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[4:28:28] kevtheaverage: casue the panels are SUPER clean
[4:28:37] Nepoxui: and thats the reason kids never take popular person opinion as the fact!

[9:52:14] kid_x_: sup mike! patrick from loaded, GET THIS BOSS DOWN! <3
[9:52:18] SafetySocks: can someone explain why they had to wipe?
[9:52:21] hikazey: Water Check
[9:52:38] Anglorion: @SafetySocks extra add spawn
[9:52:39] lyarnith: @shroud how many hours you've been on this boss today

[9:52:48] edalfaviti: what is the shotcaller playing ?
[9:52:49] hikazey: on like 2
[9:52:49] GrimaceCase: @boone696 is the learning curve hard for beginners? Every time I watch asmon plays this i get overwhelmed
[9:52:50] hooftothehead: do you look at your action bars? @shroud
[9:52:55] DJ_VS: Which one is Tayl?
[9:53:09] snake_SC: tydur i think
[9:53:14] SafetySocks: @Anglorion why did it spawn?
[9:53:20] Kizzlerip: @shroud were on the same boss right now, half the raid is getting DC'ed
[9:53:20] snake_SC: the dude that went to get mats @DJ_VS
[9:53:38] DJ_VS: Got it, i know him from the classic raids but was curious which player
[9:53:42] merlinthedrifter: i wonder when fake gamers will have their bathrooms separate from real gamers
[9:53:43] the_bhagwan: summer is really bad on everyone except ret

[9:54:41] TheUltimateStooges: @shroud would you say enhancement shamans are better than elementals this season?
[9:54:42] Boltxb: not giving to arcane on pull is baseline trolling
[9:54:49] mudgemornell: Ulduar when
[9:55:02] the_bhagwan: it doesnt give dmg to u it gives dmg to the paladin
[9:55:04] Some107: it counts on the pally for DPS though
[9:55:04] Anglorion: @SafetySocks when they change element boss spawns an add akin to the element; but when they transition to add phase, adds from previous elements also spawn; so they trigger the element change for a second so it doesn't trigger the add spawn but triggers the transition to add phase
[9:55:10] hikazey: ez win now
[9:55:29] hikazey: never touched a sword in my life
[9:55:50] the_bhagwan: i bet shroud did like 400-500k with it
[9:56:01] the_bhagwan: check hpal dps for the number

[10:18:40] insaniity: ah yeah, it's fine to help u get started but I wouldn't recommend playing with it long term. Outlaw is all about reacting to procs, and it changes a bit depending on what buffs u got @Tatertawtss
[10:18:41] jimbo87400: dude sounds sick ??
[10:19:03] Frippe_TV: @blake_schiza I would say yes, depending what you want to do, but whatever you want to do you can just get going with it once you hit 70, no grind or stupid borrowed power farming to be done
