[0:38:47] malaano: might be overproofed this time instead of under. we'll see
[0:39:34] Daemoos6: you just need a doctorate in chemistry
[0:39:37] Bashiel: Wait too long
[0:39:39] Aggy: Overproof it starts rising to much that it deflates
[0:39:44] Aggy: yours didnt look like it overproofed
[0:39:57] malaano: 9h on the counter is way too long. it should be like 1-2h depending on your temperature
[0:40:01] malaano: room temp
[0:40:06] Aggy: It will be find
[0:40:08] Aggy: fine*
[0:40:12] Tzarrus: if bread was easy everyone would make it
[0:40:15] Aggy: its a no knead with slow yeast

[0:40:28] Bashiel: Temperature in the room, humidity etc all matters
[0:40:29] abusted: 9 hours is fine
[0:40:32] Aggy: Instant yeast is like 2-3 hours tops, but slow yeast is 9
[0:40:39] Aggy: people just don't know what they are talking about LUL
[0:40:40] nohemoglibin: Sounds.... pretty needy to me
[0:40:48] Aggy: There ya go
[0:41:06] Aggy: yeah this one takes wayy longer
[0:41:12] Aggy: almost as slow as sourdough starter
[0:41:17] abusted: but works better in my opinion
[0:41:17] Aggy: Yeah
[0:41:19] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays
[0:41:28] Aggy: I prefer working with instant now because I'm always in a hurry

[0:42:15] Aggy: Bread you jsut need to understand it, after that you will never struggle
[0:42:19] Aggy: the dough speaks to you
[0:42:20] Aggy: aggyYes
[0:42:20] Bashiel: It's mostly experience
[0:42:22] Aggy: this takes practice
[0:42:33] abusted: Youll need to leard Breadanese
[0:42:36] Bashiel: No habla bread?
[0:42:44] cbiskit89: then make french bread
[0:42:45] Effin_Steffin: Dragonriding with no Dragon as an Evoker is so great. Now do it for Demon Hunters
[0:42:48] nephandis: cooking is an art, baking is chemistry. less room for error
[0:42:51] L1MP123: Ben asser ;)
[0:43:10] malaano: in my experience even active dry yeast (not instant) is pretty close in overall rise time. the only thing that takes a real long time is if you have cold room (or in fridge) or you are doing sourdough
[0:43:17] abusted: @Effin_Steffin  lol is that real? I can dragonride without a mount on my evoker?
[0:44:04] ShroudedFoxx: luxthoHi  Yo how's it going?

[0:58:52] xluckydawgx: Palworld has sold over 1 million copies in 8 hours
[0:59:14] xluckydawgx: If you had told me that a few months ago I would have laughed
[0:59:33] xluckydawgx: I played a bit this morning, im having a good time with it
[0:59:48] Baladore: Yeah, like every streamer is playing it
[1:01:00] xluckydawgx: Its very odd, but it feels good and the surival aspects are good but not super punishing, the character leveling is nice and adds a nice rpg feel to it, the automation with the Pals is cool, base building is not overly complex but still has depth
[1:01:45] gamerwoman1990: Hi lux and chat
[1:02:23] ShroudedFoxx: So what games are we playing today?
[1:02:43] xluckydawgx: Guns come later, like way later, im using a spear and a bow right now and i have a cat that punches people
[1:03:12] DPeachGaming: @Luxthos how's your morning go buddy?!  any plan of doing heroic raids today? :-D
[1:03:15] Baladore: Guns are way later, like ARK
[1:03:28] Voidthos: @xluckydawgx Hows the QoL?  Do you craft out of storage or do you have to have the mats on you?
[1:03:37] Lemussi: ele is so fun to play isnt it? Sadly  is not great on high key
[1:03:46] Baladore: @Voidthos LIke all the QoL you could ask for.
[1:04:05] xluckydawgx: @xluckydawgx I believe as long as the storage is in the base area, it pulls from it because I haven't had to have them in my pack
[1:04:14] xluckydawgx: yeah the QoL is brilliant
[1:04:38] ShroudedFoxx: What game we talking about?
[1:04:41] xluckydawgx: Palworld
[1:04:47] ShroudedFoxx: Ah got ya
[1:04:48] Narosa25: Narosa25 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Good morning friends! luxthoBlankies
[1:04:48] Voidthos: Free on game pass so no harm in trying it
[1:04:53] Baladore: Palworld, everyone thought was a scam but turned out to be great
[1:05:02] xluckydawgx: Being able to upgrade your stam, health, attack, carrying weight, etc. is sooo nice
[1:05:08] ShroudedFoxx: Yeah I've heard many things bad and good about it
[1:05:14] malaano: time to afk
[1:05:32] Voidthos: Why was it thought to be a scam @Baladore ?
[1:05:40] xluckydawgx: Because Craftopia sucked dickhole
[1:05:45] xluckydawgx: and that was their first game
[1:06:02] Voidthos: Ohhhhhh really yeah I have Craftopia KEKW
[1:06:16] xluckydawgx: But it seems like they learned their mistakes from Craftopia and really listened to player feedback
[1:06:19] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays
[1:06:24] Baladore: @Voidthos The rip off of pokemon models. And the trailers aren't the best. But the game itself is solid AF.
[1:06:39] Aggy: the bread suspense is killing me
[1:06:49] xluckydawgx: I gotta go grab my lunch so I can come back and play for a little before my next meeting
[1:06:53] xluckydawgx: be back yall
[1:07:30] Aggy: what

[1:09:02] Baladore: Before baking.
[1:09:08] sl1nky1981: The lava burst machine gun looks so satisfying
[1:09:41] Stormrazer78: since when is he elemental
[1:09:45] malaano: its just overproofed. less time on the counter and you'll be golden.
[1:10:00] GrimGoreRMW: Breadfailthos
[1:10:11] malaano: you don't have to listen to me but do some research on overproofed dough
[1:10:22] sl1nky1981: Turn it into bread pudding

[1:12:09] Erreus: might have something to do with temp in your house
[1:12:13] Erreus: is it overly warm or cold?
[1:12:27] Erreus: couple degrees can make it proof faster or slower
[1:13:22] sl1nky1981: Have you tried singing to the dough or telling it you think it's pretty?
[1:13:50] GrimGoreRMW: @sl1nky1981 luxthoIQ
[1:14:12] morp1onz: Its because your window is not on the north side of the building, therefore, the sun enters too much in your appartment and burns your dough
[1:14:35] MaxGrandpre: If I can help let me know, from what I could see you spend too much time spreading flame shock. Totem > Primordial Wave > Flame shock. That sequence will give you 6 flame shocks in 3 GCDs

[1:15:20] MaxGrandpre: A proc is a giga burst, but you can get good aoe without it
[1:16:06] Reveran: Max is good ele coach :P ive seen him play yesterday ;)
[1:16:30] SneakyFoxtrot: What kind of bread?
[1:16:32] MaxGrandpre: In my opinion, you spend all lava surges, and then spenders (earthquakes / earth shock) to get another lava surge
[1:16:39] MaxGrandpre: Lava burst hard cast comes after
[1:17:49] DTen: if u like olive oil try fuccacio bread
[1:17:56] Zladar: yo Lux, "Call Dreadstalkers" has a proc to be instant, in WA if it is on CD, it doesnt show the yellow glow that the insta cast for it is active. Is this intended, a bug, doesnt work?
[1:18:01] DTen: focaccia
[1:18:02] morp1onz: I told you what was wrong
[1:18:44] Stormrazer78: stop trolling ;)
[1:18:51] FlatulentBeaver: how do i read this raidbots sim to know what to upgrade
[1:18:55] sl1nky1981: The proc resets it, right?
[1:19:12] Zladar: Can i modify it to show me it will be instant after? It helps to prepare if i need souls shards or not
[1:19:41] MaxGrandpre: considering your gear and stats it's perfectly fine
[1:19:49] StreamElements:  Want to buy or fund anything for us to open, craft or build on stream? https://throne.com/luxthos
[1:20:50] MaxGrandpre: the worst is sometime you get procs when the pack is dead
[1:20:59] MaxGrandpre: that's what's feel bad about RNG classes
[1:21:10] Artiiz: how come you play ele instead of enh? Are enh not good anymore?
[1:22:35] Zladar: numbers are satisfying to see, even more when they pop as crits. But dayum, there are so many sources of damage today...
[1:23:28] ConvelLupus: I love enh, but ele looks so cool
[1:23:39] Artiiz: Ele for sure feels way cooler tha enh
[1:23:41] ConvelLupus: just blasting giant balls of lava all over the palce
[1:23:53] MaxGrandpre: ye haha
[1:24:22] ConvelLupus: I wish that ele had something similar to enh in the way of spreading flame shock
[1:24:26] MaxGrandpre: I also don't bother to flame shock non-elite mobs, they die too fast it's a waste of time
[1:24:28] JoeyWearsShoes: How did you like the DH?
[1:25:44] MaxGrandpre: yea exactly
[1:26:12] ahux_: fury warrior

[1:47:20] Bernardo994: lol Dutch oven
[1:47:20] Pheoris: Dash bread machines are cheap :P lol.. but the bread I've made in it has been dense... I wish it was fluffier lol.

[1:47:35] Gummybeard1: Will give you lead quick

[1:48:39] Gummybeard1: Atal will be fast
[1:48:44] Gummybeard1: Plenty of time
[1:48:45] Pheoris: But I guess they're paying you back for making fun of my innocent little snowman @Luxthos!
[1:48:52] Pheoris: And he's gone btw... :/ lol
[1:49:11] Zladar: yo lux, for bread, very simple: Flour 500 grams or 1kg, dry yeast(around 7grams), salt (2-3 pinches) add water, around 100-200 grams, make the doaugh, LEAVE IT to rest for 1h.  place it in what u want to cook it, let it rest 30mins and cook it
[1:49:16] Epicsapphire1988: i saw a recipe for half wheat half bread flour
[1:49:27] Pheoris: Did you sift the flour and then measure it out? @Luxthos I read to do that with my bread machine, so you should probably do that if you didn't.
[1:49:32] Tzarrus: maybe it cooks differently like an unleven bread?
[1:49:40] SaintTheFirst: Just tuned in; what do you need?
[1:49:42] Reveran: what you need? sorry
[1:49:46] Zladar: how much u let it rest? the bread?

[1:50:32] Tzarrus: while I need Atall, i'm only 2k rating and still trying to get a handle on Frost so i would be somewhat of a carry
[1:50:34] Zladar: just look at it, if it is double, put it in something u want to cook it, let it rest AGAIN so it grows, THEN u cook it
[1:51:00] Bernardo994: but aside from joking, when my mom would make bread it smelled amazing in the house
[1:51:11] Zladar: if the dought has doubled in size, that will result in the spaces between the bread
[1:51:51] Epicsapphire1988: trial and error

[1:52:00] Bernardo994: nah do you shut them down. We must not looose focus my man
[1:52:22] sl1nky1981: My technique is foolproof. I simply grab my wallet and keys, get in my car, go to the bakery, and buy whatever I want.

[1:53:23] alteration1545: overmixed prob
[1:53:24] Bernardo994: I dont bake. Pancake I dont like doing, it's weird
[1:53:32] sl1nky1981: Real question though, are you weighing the ingredients or just using measuring cups?
[1:53:33] Pheoris: I told him to get a bread machine @alteration1545 lol.. (even though all of the bread I have made is dense)
[1:53:46] Zladar: I understand your point of the internet being full of recepies, but the flour, dry yeast, salt and wather and leting it rest for 1h, break it and rest it again is the most simple one. made by generations
[1:53:47] alteration1545: @Pheoris this isn't the 90s pheoris
[1:53:48] xmedpakx: new dragonflight, hard bread aspect
[1:54:07] Bernardo994: Are you getting snowed on up there?
[1:54:08] alteration1545: start with rolls, they're way easier to learn and can help you with techniques for larger breads

[1:54:52] cynical_effect12: I hate baking, requires to much precision. i prefer smoking food or grilling because i can play with the recipe and make it how i want
[1:55:04] Pheoris: @alteration1545 pheoriFoxLUL Well, I hit my head hard back in 1992, so maybe I'm stuck in the 90s! LOL (hit my head on the skating rink floor.. probably had a concussion because my vision temporarily when black mid-way through my field of vision on up, but I refused to go to the hospital) So yep, now y'all know what's wrong with me lmaoooo.
[1:55:42] Pheoris: Well you just screwed it all up, lol jay kay.
[1:55:44] Sarocus: my version of cooking/baking/grilling is mostly this: 1. Apply fire 2. Insert in face
[1:55:47] Pheoris: It's edible, though, right? lol
[1:55:57] MaxGrandpre: it should

[1:56:23] Pheoris: darn
[1:56:39] sl1nky1981: Bread. Pudding.
[1:56:49] Pheoris: I googled --> The flour could have too low a protein content, there could be too much salt in the bread recipe, you did not knead it or leave it to proof long enough, or you could have killed the yeast by leaving the dough to rise in a place that was too hot.

[1:57:35] SilverkissTwitch: @Bernardo994 backing is witchcraft
[1:57:38] SilverkissTwitch: baking*
[1:57:40] Pheoris: Why is my bread so hard after baking? Why does bread go all hard after a few days? - Quora It's a combination of moisture loss and the starches re-crystallising after baking. (This crystallising process is sped up if you place the bread in the fridge). Steaming bread and then re-baking it can go surprisingly far in reviving it.
[1:57:48] Bernardo994: lol
[1:58:44] Bernardo994: I cant either, but I cook. Baking is my weakness too in cooking. Me no bake stuff
[1:58:57] SilverkissTwitch: Cooking is fun and enjoyable, baking is evil

[2:32:57] nephandis: did you buy fresh yeast or has it been kicking around for a while? my wife had issues with old yeast, even kept refrigerated
[2:33:03] DarkBlueTree: "Dense or heavy bread can be the result of not kneading the dough mix properly –out of many reasons out there. Some of the other potential reasons could be mixing the yeast & salt together or losing your patience while baking or even not creating enough tension in the finished loaf before baking the bread."
[2:33:36] Brigaterosso: How awesome is that transmog of the hunter

[2:40:55] Zladar: Lux, believe me, u put it in 50ml-100ml warm water
[2:40:57] Zladar: and it activates
[2:41:08] Zladar: after u stirr for 20 seconds, u put it in flour
[2:41:16] Tac0mancer24601: Part of that 12 hours is proofing.  another part is the dough develops more flavor
[2:41:19] malaano: @Zladar its a lost cause
[2:41:22] iunbearable: just get a  bread maker EZ
[2:41:31] Zladar: watch How To Make Bread | Jamie Oliver

[2:42:52] Epicsapphire1988: fork up those subs
[2:43:01] Tac0mancer24601: Does he put chili jam in it?
[2:43:17] Gummybeard1: @tac0mancer24601 he does :(
[2:43:35] PaganFlute: i think the wait time brings flavor and fluff too
[2:43:52] Zladar: it is not my intent to cause a fight, but i made bread, cakes. it never takes me more than 2hours
[2:43:59] Gummybeard1: Lux, i wouldnt believe everything I see on the internet
[2:44:02] malaano: can you search the difference between active dry and instant? the difference is not too significant
[2:44:13] Zladar: i let by mistake the dough for 6 hours and it started to "cook" and go bad
[2:44:19] Stormrazer78: gn hf
[2:45:10] Gummybeard1: It took 20h to make the broth
[2:45:15] FrankTheTank1988: luxthoHi

[2:46:30] StreamElements: MamzellJ just raided the channel with 25 viewers PogChamp
[2:46:34] Tac0mancer24601: There are a bazillion ways to make bread.  Some people bloom the yeast in water.
[2:46:38] FireKiller13: Welcome raiders
[2:46:40] MamzellJ: Hiiiiii :D
[2:47:01] LazyPanzer: Tout les streams menent a Luxthos. Can't escape.
[2:47:02] Finiin: dumb question but for those who have a bread maker how long is the bread good for?
[2:47:05] PaganFlute: and she also said dry active yeast!
[2:47:26] MamzellJ: very good ! did keystones with @LazyPanzer hehe, he said it was like I wasnt even in the keys :')
[2:47:53] Lauriegami: Yay we raided lux!
[2:48:12] MamzellJ: @Lauriegami yesss !!
[2:48:13] Zladar: it works, letting it rest creates bubles inside that makes it flufy when cooked
[2:48:18] Epicsapphire1988: you gotta play with it lux
[2:48:35] DarkBlueTree: Found your issue:   you didn't have jazz music playing while making your bread
[2:48:36] iunbearable: 1.5 hours
[2:48:46] malaano: you need to do the time based on feel, since it can be different based on the temp in your room
[2:48:53] Stormrazer78: gn hf
[2:48:59] Bernardo994: yyea that might be it
[2:49:04] Bernardo994: lol
[2:49:05] LazyPanzer: It's too OP, Blizz is gonna hotfix it ResidentSleeper
[2:49:07] PaganFlute: but she did not test the fluffyness of the bread on cam xD
[2:49:26] nephandis: I would say definitely let your yeast bloom when you try it again
[2:49:29] PaganFlute: fake bread for ads :P
[2:49:43] Lauriegami: The crust?!??!?
[2:49:55] LazyPanzer: Bread ASMR
[2:49:57] Zladar: u can check the bread with a toothpick if it is cooked, stab it and check if dough gets sticking on the toothpick, if it does, not cooked enough
[2:50:00] malaano: just don't give up
[2:50:02] xluckydawgx: @Luxthos whats your elevation over sea level?
[2:50:02] malaano: you'll get it
[2:50:03] iunbearable: sour break is amazing

[2:51:12] iunbearable: no.. youre gonna lose ur luxthoTurd
[2:51:13] ebfg: yes
[2:51:16] SaintTheFirst: We would like to know more!
[2:51:26] alteration1545: that's also tablespoons (3x as much as a teaspoon, which they wrote on the screen)
[2:51:28] Gummybeard1: Im hungry now
[2:51:30] PaganFlute: if u make so much fail bread u could feed a whole homeless kitchen and these ppl would be happy ^^
[2:51:30] SaintTheFirst: What salt do you have?
[2:51:41] Mesohippus: ask a neighbor
[2:51:44] MamzellJ: I feel like the salt is important, but I couldnt say why
[2:51:47] alteration1545: that salt is fine - put it in a bowl and use a little less
[2:51:54] nephandis: grind it into a bowl and then measure from that?
[2:51:54] ShroudedFoxx: I'm eating a good ramen RN... So good
[2:51:55] sponx: Honestly, don't overthink it. Every thursday & friday I used to make bread for around 100 kids, I did this for almost 3 years
[2:51:57] justlikcandy67: are you weighing the flour or measuring?
[2:52:02] iunbearable: grind the salt on a plate
[2:52:14] alteration1545: I don't trust what they're writing, the measuring spoons used don't align with the measurements written on screen
[2:52:18] Lauriegami: Just make sure you dont put too much salt in, last time my bread was DEADLY 😭
[2:52:24] SaintTheFirst: Ah, yeah need to get some old school table salt for cooking; pink H would work but you'd need to mortar/pestle it to a grit/table salt level
[2:52:28] PaganFlute: is it really like a stone? never made bread ^^
[2:52:33] Reveran: !gamble 25%

[2:52:40] Bernardo994: salt is important to taste.
[2:52:45] SaintTheFirst: very
[2:52:54] sponx: Get a mixer
[2:52:59] PaganFlute: i think the cozy dreamy music makes the bread fluff ^^
[2:53:09] Zladar: mix it untill the dough is soft, not stickiy and it does not break if u hold it haning
[2:53:10] MaxGrandpre: I'll get you my mom on the phone, she makes the best bread
[2:53:47] Lauriegami: @maxgrandpre would she mind sharing her recipe with us also? ✨️
[2:53:55] MaxGrandpre: NO Kappa
[2:54:01] MaxGrandpre: I can actually ask her
[2:54:12] LazyPanzer: Moist Kreygasm
[2:54:15] MamzellJ: omg
[2:54:19] Zladar: holy fuck, no
[2:54:23] Bernardo994: and this is why I dont bake
[2:54:24] Zladar: 20hrs :))))
[2:54:25] iunbearable: if you over mix the dough, you active the yeast to soon.
[2:54:29] Lauriegami: @maxgrandpre please do, I'm looking for a good bread recipe
[2:54:39] Oviedange: "Dont forget to proof your dought for 18 months before you send it off to college"
[2:54:42] Krevish: Baking is chemistry in an edible form lol
[2:54:50] Zladar: find and trust an italian on youtube, even more if he is old
[2:54:54] PaganFlute: U wanna know the difference? She showed u actual fluff bread while the 1 hour bread looked like a fake ad bread with no shown test ^^
[2:55:14] alteration1545: baking isn't that hard, it's just understanding how ingredients work together
[2:55:28] Ronangic: salt is important for other things besides flavor
[2:55:34] Devildriver007: kneading too much can make it hard?
[2:55:35] Devildriver007: not sure
[2:55:37] Ronangic: Yeast Regulation: Salt regulates yeast activity. It controls the fermentation process by slowing down yeast growth, preventing the dough from rising too quickly. This contributes to a better structure and texture in the final product.
[2:55:38] sponx: Baking is about feel tbh, so much depends on the type of flour, yeast, even how hard/soft your tap water is
[2:55:47] sazern: kinda hope your shit doesn't look like that tbh
[2:55:48] Zladar: where do u live, i can come make u one in 1 month. I just need to take my visa :))
[2:55:52] StarbuckTech: if your shit looks like that see a doctor lol
[2:55:55] Ronangic: Dough Texture: Salt affects the texture of the dough. It influences the water absorption of flour, leading to the proper hydration of the dough. This affects the crumb structure, making it more uniform and preventing the bread from becoming overly dense.
[2:56:07] nephandis: @sponx also room temperature and humidity factor in
[2:56:09] alteration1545: do a towel & plate
[2:56:10] sponx: Yeah, cover that shit

[2:56:23] malaano: how much yeast did she use?
[2:56:25] alteration1545: I'll even throw some plastic wrap on there for a good seal
[2:56:31] Zladar: if the dough makes a crust after resting, it may go bad, too warm in the environment and starts cooking
[2:56:33] Ronangic: salt could be a culprit in your dense breads for sure
[2:56:46] iunbearable: You just need a 24hrs stream LUL

[3:02:38] Darkside1366: development of that gluten

[3:13:45] ectoman1ac: @Tzarrus does she eat any regular potato chips?
[3:13:47] alteration1545: @alteration1545 it's a form of salt that's naturally found in tomatoes and some cheeses. most people still falsely assume it's a negative additive of chinese food (from racist propaganda in the 70s/80s) Nerdge
[3:13:47] sponx: savoury is what I would call it in english I guess
[3:14:05] ectoman1ac: yep, anti msg propaganda stems from anti chinese racism in USA

[3:14:40] Zladar: no, salt goes in flour before puttin the yeast from warm water

[3:22:10] xluckydawgx: with baking you ALWAYS measure no matter what
[3:22:22] xluckydawgx: its not like cooking where you can eye it

[3:27:56] Sanitywarped: i think (not a baker) that as long as its alive you dont need to wait
[3:28:02] ectoman1ac: is it instant yeast?
[3:28:03] NoodlezNoggin: I think I do about 10 mins for the yeast to bloom
[3:28:09] Epicsapphire1988: @ectoman1ac active
[3:28:10] Zladar: mix and pour it
[3:28:12] malaano: just dump it

[5:26:30] LazyPanzer: *stalky stalky*
[5:26:35] loppy_07: can tank
[5:27:04] Naus24: do you raffle your keys or just pick ppl?
[5:27:06] Strouss: Have ypu tried wrath classic gamma's? I find them kust as challenging as retail keys.
[5:27:10] destrominater: It's fun, but you're MOSTLY capped at 4 targets. Spreading fireshock feels like crap too.
[5:27:20] giggity360: HOME FROM WORK PALWORLD TIME LETS GOOOOOOO
[5:27:51] LazyPanzer: Day's been breaded
[5:27:58] giggity360: gammas are like, wrath m+
[5:28:03] destrominater: I think Blizz needs to pick a spec identity for ele and enahnce. Both are trying to do the elemental thing. Just give ele fire and earth. Ele gets lightning and frost.
[5:28:10] xluckydawgx: @giggity360 WOOOOOOOOO
[5:28:27] destrominater: enhance gets frost and lightning rather
[5:28:51] Lundrai: It'd be cool if it was like red mage in ffxiv
[5:29:00] Lundrai: in and out of melee by rotation
[5:29:01] Strouss: There is only two nonranged melee left.
[5:29:48] trinilime: enh would be cool if it actually felt like you were "enhancing" your melee. we only have what, 2 melee abilities?
[5:30:05] destrominater: @trinilime I feel ya
[5:30:06] giggity360: fuck it, give shaman a 4th spec like druids and give each spec an element. resto water, ranged lightning, melee fire, tank earth
[5:30:32] Strouss: @giggity360 that would be neat
[5:31:03] destrominater: There's a critical amount of mastery, haste, and verse needed for ele. Once you hit it you're competitive, but not amazing.
[5:31:08] trinilime: I wonder if they could give the weapon enchants for enh more depth. maybe they could make the more dynamic?
[5:31:43] Strouss: I think give more volume to totems would be good
[5:32:35] trinilime: I do genuinely miss when totems played a bigger role. they're mostly just cooldowns, might as well not be a totem
[5:33:07] trinilime: it's so nice in this affix that's true
[5:33:35] sl1nky1981: Noob hunter...noob shaman...
[5:33:47] sl1nky1981: I mean Lux is a noob on both
[5:33:53] sl1nky1981: not that the hunter in the key is a noob
[5:33:57] sl1nky1981: sorry
[5:34:02] Strouss: I have been playing wrath gearing for icc been a blast. And a real change i figured id get bored.
[5:34:14] trinilime: I just feel like the whole totem concept could probably be reworked to be more interesting. it could be a very unique mechanic but instead they are just cooldowns (even if they are useful)
[5:34:23] chinaman900: didnt there use be a hunter pet that could rez
[5:34:34] Strouss: Yeah

[5:36:20] Aquatic_Sloth: what a terrible affix
[5:37:08] Strouss: I would take affix ocer the frost affic in wrath gammas lol
[5:37:21] destrominater: That's kind of what I meant about flameshock spreading. The pack is often dead before you can really get going.

[6:23:50] GrimGoreRMW: google says:  The most common reason this error message would show up is a corrupted temporary file inside of World of Warcraft. The temporary files can become corrupted if the game doesn't shutdown properly, the computer doesn't turn off properly, or if you play the game with addons.
