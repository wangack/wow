[1:04:28] just_ouro: Its not fixed
[1:04:28] arieuh: that rune bullshit
[1:04:50] just_ouro: No shot its harder
[1:05:20] just_ouro: I found the tech for farming out the air ones. It went super quick. But if they reduce it to 5 of each, it wont be bad
[1:05:31] bigsquidx: power surge is easy tho the elite mob kills himself after 30secs
[1:07:15] uaintgotno1: what's the tech? asking for a friend ofc...
[1:08:05] just_ouro: Yeah, shaman runes are a bit ... special
[1:09:05] just_ouro: @uaintgotno1 Kill the basilisk and vultures at 42,57. They share spawns with the elementals. Its much more efficient than just running around the map like most people do
[1:09:18] just_ouro: that sounds toxic
[1:10:13] just_ouro: Gotta do it at the demon hours

[2:33:30] Barry74: you need something 2 do dmg?
[2:33:36] godseb: not even that
[2:33:40] godseb: just geting hit is enough
[2:33:42] godseb: by a melee attack
[2:33:43] Barry74: lmao

[2:34:53] Barry74: have him spam rank 1 frost bolt
[2:35:07] Barry74: rip
[2:35:34] godseb: your own dmg (yellow attacks and melee) works, stuff like shield spike, thorns etc works i think
[2:35:38] peeweeherman69: "Fun detected"
[2:35:40] godseb: and getting hit by melee atacks
[2:35:59] saadaanse: arc expl?

[2:40:13] thotfull_: yeah you can. just need to wait for rockbiter to fall off
[2:40:15] freewaysouros: you can
[2:40:16] Eatmz: yes you dont need RB since you cast free spell
[2:40:18] Eatmz: you never go oom
[2:40:21] Eatmz: its insane
[2:40:23] Jack_kgbeast: WF - less mana regen from SR
[2:40:27] freewaysouros: put the weap in the bag
[2:40:29] freewaysouros: and use it
[2:41:17] typer___iban: shield is kinda useless vs casters, and procs off melee, so dw vs casters makles sense tho?
[2:41:35] bigsquidx: nah you 100% use shield its like double armor half the time ur gonna be stunned anyways and not auto attacking

[2:49:01] epicmassacreoneu: So playing troll with haste gives you even faster proccs
[2:49:38] Rias_TTV: didn't the guy say try double windfury weapon for the procs?
[2:51:07] Leggahots: when your mana is very low u can use bloodfury to increase manareg with sham rage
