[1:58:42] TyHeals: Dude this stupid ass berserker rune for druids is the worst haha
[1:58:58] PastryDeath: @tyheals what do you mean? that it’s op?
[2:00:12] PastryDeath: Ahh yeah, honestly I don’t know why anybody is still playing feral after they buffed boomkin
[2:00:20] TyHeals: @PastryDeath No the actual mechanic feels like it is sooo bugged or something lol
[2:00:33] TyHeals: to actually get the rune
[2:00:47] TyHeals: I play feral because Windfury = guaranteed groups

[2:06:00] PastryDeath: No way, anti-rogue rune Kreygasm
[2:06:08] rollinsthechamp: 3 runes still to discover for locks.. most other classes almost have all found
[2:06:48] Twerkinrogue: playing paladin right now and the new mana rune is bonkers
[2:07:00] Twerkinrogue: you literally cant go oom
[2:07:07] PastryDeath: @twerkinrogue paladins basically have their entire wotlk kit
[2:07:23] PastryDeath: They imo are the best class in the game
[2:07:48] rollinsthechamp: @snutzy What do you say about the Rune Demonic Knowledge combined with the Trinket from Blood Moon Event that gives the Pet 20 Stam+80 Int and then the Voidwalker? Wouldnt that give Lock the most Advantage? or maybe Felhunter?
[2:08:16] demololtv: did we get a rune?
[2:08:28] rollinsthechamp: @snutzy Aight I´ll wait then for you doing it :D

[2:09:40] hansmantzacht: witch spec u use for lvling ?
[2:09:53] rollinsthechamp: @snutzy Kinda hyped about what runes and talents you pick because Lock can go so deep dmg-wise with trinkets+runes I feel like
[2:09:55] PastryDeath: if crit dots makes it into the game warlocks will be the best dps easy
[2:10:03] hansmantzacht: with voley ?
[2:10:31] wibez84: hey Snutz! what new runes you think will be good for affli lock? I don’t really like any of the new ones
