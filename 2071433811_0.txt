[1:52:24] zero_rawrxd: zereth mortis was awesome
[1:52:30] Destrolisher: "add more of these things? no i didn't do that zone"
[1:52:32] danaxvx: ZM mini games: not fun
[1:52:46] AntiNyx: the turn lights off mini game was sick
[1:52:51] boofyo: you also needed to do the story to get the unity leggo

[1:54:24] OhFishally: FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:54:25] Remery: @danaxvx torghast would be actually good if it was intended once as weekly and more for cosmetics. not an annoying chore to spam every week x10
[1:54:29] kitty0chi: wait is that ayije on screen the same ayije that sometimes lurks in here with us?
[1:54:34] OhFishally: Aware
[1:54:38] boofyo: its also the joshua fight
[1:54:41] simplepathwow: 39 Despairge

[1:54:48] spanqt: how old is JB even?
[1:54:50] kitty0chi: holy sh*t nice
[1:54:55] Dotctori: Wait Jb is under 50?
[1:54:59] jujumann35: i thought that was moad, eu disc priest

[1:55:04] kitty0chi: also growl you're important
[1:55:05] kitten_kebab: jb is not even 40
[1:55:06] stormz_wow: i wonder if we will see a disc priest at all in this mdi
[1:55:22] SCMSV: JB somehow still isn't the oldest streamer I know
[1:55:39] Adrang: wowgrandma exists
[1:55:40] particles2: chat, is arcane mage hard? shit looks fun when i see it but people say its meh to play
[1:55:48] Khasiz: reputation as well or something
[1:55:54] Cruzerthebruzer: i think they said rep was account wide too
[1:55:55] Ajatus: Madge
[1:55:56] kitten_kebab: reputation is like x4
[1:56:00] AyeLoud: m+ portals
[1:56:13] boofyo: @particles2 its harder than frost but its not as hard as everyone says
[1:56:17] purplenbrown: they need to put in stuff to get screen time from players
[1:56:19] waelrick: let us send to crests to alts
[1:56:20] kitten_kebab: account wide gear Pog
[1:56:28] marionberry88: DF has been so alt friendly, but every other xpac had all the extra bullshit
[1:56:35] zero_rawrxd: seed farn
[1:56:39] fomalhaut_b: Aware
[1:56:40] kitten_kebab: Ring
[1:56:41] danaxvx: emerald dream rep
[1:56:41] Ajatus: perma aug rune from new one
[1:56:41] MierkaBlue: the upgrade tokens, the mount of those are problems to my alts constantly
[1:56:44] Hyvest: maruuk content was great
[1:56:46] CMTerp: it feels like its never been easier to play alts
[1:56:46] MierkaBlue: *amount
[1:56:55] simplepathwow: emerald dream was kinda big
[1:56:57] ConchubarOD: If you have a level 20 dream warden guy, it happens almost immediately on other charcters.
[1:57:04] kitten_kebab: first season rep ring farm
[1:57:05] Dotctori: Imagine farming augment rune when you could just buy em from ah
[1:57:06] scripterhere: scripterhere subscribed with Prime. 
[1:57:12] ShaggySummers: That rune just isn't worth the money
[1:57:15] particles2: @boofyo would you say its a fluidish fun playstyle? i know its hard to answer since youre not me right and dont know my playstyle. but ive meleed for like 15 years, wana do caster
[1:57:17] Yearnxo: the only thing thats annoying is that to get a half decent ilvl on you have to do like 100 keys worth of crests
[1:57:24] zolal3: -100k
[1:57:40] FawnOfTime: damn eclipse is mauling them
[1:57:46] MBG_95: slower
[1:57:56] Blane86: @waelrick i got a better idea. Why not let us earn more crests as the season progresses like 2x at this point
[1:58:10] CMTerp: @particles2 You have to do your burst windows right or you do no damage. Frost has a much less spiky damage profile
[1:58:12] MBG_95: 11:16 perplexed vs 11:37 Eclipse
[1:58:16] boofyo: @particles2 yeah it flows pretty well its not as proccy as fire or rogue
[1:58:32] danaxvx: last stand - type qualifiers
[1:59:11] ShaggySummers: slowing up
[1:59:14] lord_rimheart: slowing up? HUHH
[1:59:40] ShaggySummers: Calm up dude
[2:00:11] Themselves: bla
[2:00:29] particles2: @boofyo last question sorry big dog lol. as a melee going caster after years (also did tanking) would you say arcane mage or lock (prob aff/des) would be a more suitable style
[2:00:54] danaxvx: damage incoming would be better than HPS
[2:00:58] particles2: dratnos lookin so slick
[2:01:20] AUTiger0325: @particles2 Then he smiles and he looks like he's from Alabama.
[2:01:24] Adrang: def not arcane. Arcane is really about preplanning movemet, wjich is a difficult thing for any player learning ranged, even more for melee mains where that isnt as important
[2:01:30] particles2: @AUTiger0325 still not fixed KEKW
[2:01:37] kitten_kebab: Beard makes Dratnos look old
[2:01:43] AUTiger0325: @particles2 He said like a few more weeks.
[2:02:01] particles2: @AUTiger0325 I feel his pain ive had to wait 2 months before in my small town lol
[2:02:12] 1111111111112233: guys i just got here were there any cool new comps or its more of the same ?
[2:02:13] Hymmer: FLASHBANG
[2:02:43] wowjulius: same comps
[2:02:51] kitten_kebab: grandpa tales again
[2:03:22] boofyo: @particles2 which ever you like more i went from hpal to mage last tier and its a learning curve
[2:03:28] zecti0n1: Dratnos looks like a dwarf from lord of the rings
[2:04:59] OhFishally: Oldge2
[2:05:00] kitten_kebab: Dorki dominates
[2:05:02] Otazz: Oldge2
[2:05:10] Thowarr: "back in my day..."
[2:05:14] menzlo: Echo could have done legendary atal pull but didn't
[2:05:53] particles2: false, everything is 50/50 it either hits or it doesnt

[2:10:51] AyeLoud: o7
[2:10:56] Izkatu: archon design is ugly
[2:11:07] Scarrboros: subcreation was so much better
[2:11:11] Izkatu: yeah and confusing
[2:11:14] CMTerp: if you click on a spec it shows you the average top 100 players gear and talents and stuff
[2:11:15] AyeLoud: They take their info from wowhead guides
[2:11:20] Scarrboros: but at least they are trying to improve it from what I could tell
[2:11:21] Adrang: 20 to 32 is a fucking huge range
[2:11:28] particles2: think the best thing for this is a jumping off point for specs and what to run
[2:11:40] CMTerp: ignore the tier lists. click on a spec
[2:11:43] CMTerp: it has a lot of good info
[2:11:46] zachl_: @particles2 wsg my dude
[2:11:46] travtravtrav_: they hired him for a contract i think

[3:11:13] sooperman64: Dont they legit pull through the wall in atal?
[3:11:16] Adrang: I thought the language of the rule was something like a part of the dungeon that wasnt accessible
[3:11:19] imjebb: cringe blizz
[3:11:19] sooperman64: On the 3rd boss
[3:11:27] Azmort: @sooperman64 yes
[3:11:30] Adrang: but that part WAS accessible before
[3:11:32] sooperman64: Like we just watched perplexed do it haha
[3:11:42] onewidit: how is pulling through the wall different than snapping? It's manipulating the available mechanics.
[3:12:07] shultsy: so was it a DQ or just lost the map?
[3:12:08] Silencbank: @sooperman64 they pull the mobs BEFORE the boss, which seems to be ok.  mandatory seems to have pulled AFTER the boss got started
[3:12:49] Ajatus: @shultsy map loss
[3:13:18] aNxje: Cringe
[3:13:26] SupaCoopa2688: if its such a big issue then design the game better. Don't penalize teams for the shit state of the dungeons

[3:27:35] stormz_wow: @drdrozd12 what was the reason given for the DQ?
[3:27:39] SCMSV: NotLikeThis
[3:27:41] Ajatus: @stormz_wow their dht route was dq'd for pulling something through a wall they werent allowed to so they got a map loss
[3:27:48] tvilk: @stormz_wow they got DQ'd from the DHT win cus they apparently aren't allowed to pull the dryad+lasher pack into first boss, unless they do it how blizzard wants them to
[3:27:51] drdrozd12: some weitd wall pulling shit
[3:28:41] stormz_wow: @tvilk lmao what? we literally just see ppl snapping things interdimensional but they had issue with pulling the dryad???
[3:28:51] Ajatus: pulling through progress impeding walls has always been banned. remember zulgamux in grimrail tgp?
[3:29:03] tvilk: @stormz_wow yeah but.. you wouldnt get it.. its like.. you have to have a really high iq to understand it so..
[3:29:09] skarg__: they pulled past progression
[3:29:34] tvilk: @Ajatus yeah but its not progress impeding.. you can literally clear all trash after first boss, without killing first boss..
[3:29:42] Marenjok: afternoon gamers
[3:29:51] ngbcalvin: you also have double PI's
[3:30:03] Ajatus: @tvilk admins not that smart bucko

[3:30:39] baseboned: I've never heard of these next two teams, have either competed before under a different name?
[3:30:48] stormz_wow: @skarg__ i see so you can't pull ahead of your current prog but everything behind is fine? interesting
[3:30:48] tvilk: @Ajatus Hey don't talk bad about the admins, they are very intellectual individuals who helped design the dungeons and the whole snapping thing in Rise was actually designed with that kind of pull in mind so you just wouldnt get it
[3:31:11] Ajatus: newshy is a mdi admin?

[3:37:50] Ajatus: @drdrozd12 ye better french
[3:38:01] MierkaBlue: I just wonder how snapping the pvp boss trash to Morchie is not the same thing as that dryad? so because it has a thing that is unique in that dungeon but also included snapping on bosses trash to another - then this is somehow better than pulling one pack during boss when the door technically is "closing"?
[3:38:02] drdrozd12: quebecois is an insult to speech
[3:38:07] Ajatus: NA french > EU french
