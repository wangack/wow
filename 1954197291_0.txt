[0:39:51] Spacecow2004: Wait is it not HC anymore?
[0:39:52] freekittens03: Give points for first to 60. First there gets 100 DKP, next get 95 DKP etc
[0:39:52] Madden044: I think run it per hour is better
[0:39:53] atrigent: what does dkp actually do
[0:39:53] nemste: Lost the amount of levels you got as -dkp
[0:39:53] Soap_v: @rotvic9 re
[0:39:54] Acridior: 50%
[0:39:54] hitagifan24: There can be other ways to get dkp
[0:39:55] bogusny: @Novacht, if the question is category then no it doesn't NOIDONTTHINKSO
[0:39:55] p_i_x_u_s: u stop getting dkp until you reach the level where you died
[0:39:55] Ysaf: make an alt
[0:39:56] UraniumQ33: it is HC
[0:39:57] Sarconick: dkp start after lvl 10
[0:39:57] Bestrich03: death should go negative
[0:39:57] Thorolder: @sodapoppin the way you do it is you have them give you their /played at lvl 59 before they ding, and give them some bonus per 10 levels, then you just time the bonus by 6
[0:39:58] softbonez: i mean if u raid at lvl 60, isnt everyone gonna get the same amount of dkp roughly anyway? by the time theyre raiding, so its +-0 if they get any
[0:39:58] 9Merk: add another 1 per level without getting your hand held with restedxp guide
[0:39:58] savitar1_: 60 is not that much though right?
[0:39:58] Glttr: yeah but everyone starts at 60dkp essentially
[0:39:59] Korrections: 1 per 5 levels
[0:39:59] TheWillyGTV: THATS A MINUS FUCKING 10 DKP
[0:40:01] UraniumQ33: but you can make a new character
[0:40:01] javich14: re charge
[0:40:02] Heaf89: Not just reset, start with -1dkp first death, -2dkp second death etc
[0:40:03] SinReglas: first 20 ppl to hit 60 get bonus
[0:40:04] RYANiME: Jamgie
[0:40:04] thewiseoldturtle: it NEEDS to reset, otherwise keep farming dkp leveling low level
[0:40:06] LightSir_: could give more dkp for later levels
[0:40:06] JustHarold: Deaths are a stacking -5
[0:40:07] g0atse711: Only do it for 1 week

[0:40:09] YaBoyJack: man I missed like everything about the guild I have no lcue wtf is going on
[0:40:09] RYANiME: Hmm
[0:40:10] Hodursson: gain 1 per level and lose 2 by level lost when dead
[0:40:10] naarnia: -10 per death / extra for stupid death / extra again for offstream death @sodapoppin Hmm
[0:40:10] LMAOBRUHLOLXD: im eating some weak ass food chat pray for me
[0:40:10] SARcasm19: @sodapoppin some people don't stream on twitch
[0:40:11] smoofers: @sodapoppin give points for playtime based on the number the person put as their wow skill
[0:40:11] justGonzi: shouldnt it also amass by virtues like helping groups n stuff
[0:40:12] MrBunnyPants: loot and gear from raids will give more thought to spending dkp
[0:40:12] silverhawk18: these streamers need structure. Boring is good
[0:40:12] leo6gm: Jigglin
[0:40:13] shaolinya: Can we see guild chat @sodapoppin
[0:40:13] bobbymondays: You can't go by category bc of wrath/retail/classic etc @bogusny
[0:40:13] xMagnason: Should have been LonelyFangs @sodapoppin
[0:40:14] Beyonder66: u can make it to 120 and if some1 dies he goes to 60
[0:40:14] DreamMistM: veiHmm
[0:40:15] JariMurhapuro: 1 dkp per level and 1 per 10 hours?
[0:40:15] silverhawk18: :p
[0:40:17] DreamMistM: mhm
[0:40:17] Wonfiii: +1 dkp per level, +2 per level while live NODDERS
[0:40:18] SinReglas: first 20 ppl to hit 60 get bonus?
[0:40:18] prelk0: every death is -5 dkp and is stack for deaths 3 deaths is -15 dkp at start
[0:40:19] cevi123: yeah if you only use dkp at 60 everyone basically gets 60 dkp at 60 which makes everyone get 0 dkp
[0:40:22] KaiZeEKing: sodaHmmOk so here's the story. these humans bad
[0:40:22] JediNate: by lvls ur dont start getting dkp until lvl 20
[0:40:24] EndlessPillows: should be time based, you want to reward people for doing other game stuff IE professions
[0:40:24] Ashyx: @Heaf89 i like it
[0:40:24] TNG_Picard: Level checkpoints, rewarding people who hit certain goals first, to incentivize quick leveling
[0:40:24] Retpally9329: 5-10 seems fine
[0:40:24] g0atse711: @sodapoppin 1 week for the bonus DKP
[0:40:25] Smoogol: Jigglin  󠀀
[0:40:25] UraniumQ33: +5 DKP for every 10 levels you get?
[0:40:26] therealchapman: just blizzard
[0:40:26] elgoonies: Streamers are going to do just chatting an other games itll be too hard to track
[0:40:26] wakenb2k: first one to hit 60 should get bonus dkp
[0:40:28] gasmixx: lose double what they had if they die
[0:40:28] bobbymondays: @bogusny, the twitch API call wouldn't know which version of WOW
[0:40:29] MrBunnyPants: and DKP mok'gara events
[0:40:30] Weeshy_Dude: if you do it per level it is effectively useless since everyone has it, it should be time based but possibly even more rewarding once people are 60
[0:40:30] smoofers: lower wow skill rating = more dkp per hour etc.
[0:40:33] work_inc: Oh soda is cultured this is a banger
[0:40:34] jaisylee: lose all dkp - [#timesdied]*5
[0:40:34] r1i1o1t1: i died on my 53 warrior sadge
[0:40:36] naarnia: -10 per death / extra for stupid death / extra again for offstream death Hmm
[0:40:38] Cryoschaos: if you did it per hour it makes professions worth something too
[0:40:40] Fossabot: Buy my cat plushies: https://sodapoppin.shop/plushies
[0:40:40] RYANiME: sodaAyaya hic~
[0:40:43] Hunter_Donn: 1 death = dkp halved
[0:40:46] rodri_asd: Only 60 dkp but passive
[0:40:52] LMAOBRUHLOLXD: @r1i1o1t1 id take a break
[0:40:52] boneweaver99: they dont need dkp for levelling their incentive to lvl is getting in the raid in the first place
[0:40:52] mondexe: give dkp per level depending on their "classic skills" so "worse" player are incentivize to keep going
[0:40:53] BannedByGates: How does a small streamer try to get into the guild?
[0:40:53] minecrepe: PeoplesChamp
[0:40:54] smoofers: you asked people for their "level of skill" in wow - use that for DKP
[0:40:54] Klarc: per  level seems bad cause the levels start taking so long
[0:40:59] Spens_: Got a few gamers in the lvl 30s
[0:41:00] konoxians: -dkp for death would be good
[0:41:01] ImOome: -5dkp if no evidence of death
[0:41:01] Lohai: ask the council
[0:41:04] cevi123: a tiny problem is, do a lot of these people even care about dkp xdd
[0:41:05] MPGod42: they need to provide a death clip or -dkp
[0:41:05] Jingosu: losing dkp is negated if they make a good apology video
[0:41:06] OfSpiral: if you dont record your death its even more -dkp
[0:41:06] JacuZ_: judge each death to decide DKP loss Hmm @sodapoppin

[0:42:01] g0atse711: @sodapoppin if you do the DKP bonus for 1 week it will incentivize people to play now not later
[0:42:02] CiganitroVEVO: @sodapoppin if you do it per hr it punishes fast levelers
[0:42:03] konoxians: die intentionally to get more dkp xdd
[0:42:04] Bestrich03: Inflation is bad
[0:42:04] merickmk: Per level is worthless since DKP is only useful at 60, everyone will have the same +60 in the end

[3:45:00] herculesrockefeller: @cowswilldominate ok so you are right the "Germanic tribes" are a lot older then the Rome, how ever the Germanicus -> Germany is Latin  , They named you. You all were scatted tribes before Romans. Germany as nation is very new, 1871. Unlike you Cousins the Franks who were nation much early.
