[2:53:22] SmoothMooseTV: i know a few people that will play who havent played vanilla
[2:53:23] OliviaGG: rip to launch pvp server levelers
[2:53:27] AnotherCheche: same
[2:53:28] Bubonicc: 3 hours queues LETS GOOOOOOO
[2:53:28] Cozo_TV: I also think blizzard underestimates classic succes
[2:53:29] Avinar: I think that TBC will probably have like 70% of the number of players vanilla launch had but it will have more players throughout the xpac. @sodapoppin

[2:53:45] sygyzy07: The hype isn't even close. I think the world wanted vanilla, i think enfranchised wow nerds wanted tbc
[2:53:46] Bashoot: thats 60 to 70 right?
[2:53:49] 0xygenhomie: only reason i was hyped for classic was the eventuality of BC classic
[2:53:50] dead_lee_: Im more hype for tbc. Classes are better imo
[2:53:51] delester25: id say tbc is more hype becasue it was just better

[2:54:04] loukangbang_: @DemonHunterSkater TRUE
[2:54:07] noteimako: people wont be as hyped for bc cuz 50% of the hype players got crushed by leveling
