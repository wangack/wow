[0:29:51] Starship_EU: (sorry for killing you) xD
[0:30:08] Thaonly: @Sco THE fuck you washed up sco from steppin down. "
[0:32:07] shuunno: i play classic atm and i can see why some og players dont like what the game have become... soo different.. not even the same game anymore :(
[0:32:13] LGhost: would be even cooler if kicks worked that way too
[0:33:02] LGhost: very frustrating in pugs
[0:33:05] Thaonly: @Sco have you ever thought about moving to a diff country? Since I guess ur work dosent really "demand" being at a specific location? Or maybe I am wrong. Maybe you have to be in scottland.
[0:33:49] Thaonly: @Sco yeah being close to family is worth alot I guess.
[0:33:56] 0kfatty: bic boy scoo! come back to thailand
[0:35:05] Thaonly: I wonder were this game is gonna b in 10 years from now. I mean Sco and Kungen will always be remembered. True Legends.
[0:35:16] 0kfatty: no but i want to, becouse of food and overall prices.
[0:35:47] 0kfatty: whats the tax over there? i never checked it.
[0:36:06] x___Nova___x: xnovaxHi  Hello Sco
[0:38:37] Thaonly: @Sco you really think its gonna be the top MMO in 10 years from now aswell? I mean it has been for the past 20 years. But feels like its time for a mmo to replace? Maybe I am completely wrong tho. Would be sick if WOW still is the best 2034!
[0:40:28] Thaonly: @Sco Do you really think it would spike the playerbase that much?
[0:40:58] sigilfish: Wow will be in gamepass 100%
[0:41:01] Jhelnok: 20
[0:41:02] Thaonly: @Sco 20 I thin
[0:41:08] BreksMT: younger audience would hate to press more than 5 buttons
[0:41:36] LighterozTV: @BreksMT meanwhile building a whole city in fortnite
[0:41:50] sigilfish: Starter experience isn't good in wow, there is huge disconnection between old and new content
[0:41:55] Thaonly: @Sco what? what you mean controller?
[0:41:57] delester25: modern gamers dislike playing true MMOS only reason WoW is still alive is because of its fanbase, thats why every "wowkiller" died after a few months or year
[0:42:15] Thaonly: @Sco HAHAHAH how the fuck is that done?
[0:42:19] Mikey1678: some people play on steam deck too
[0:42:27] sigilfish: There are some addons for controller stuff
[0:42:36] loweery: jack was showing how to do it on controller.
[0:42:43] LighterozTV: those ppl just play the game casually
[0:42:45] Thaonly: @Sco Must have trolle y?
[0:43:05] Thaonly: d
[0:43:30] Thaonly: controller with 5 buttons kekw ^^

[0:46:53] cayna: The game is different enough from campaing to campaing
[0:46:57] cayna: that you can easily do a campaing with adeline
[0:46:58] sigilfish: Of course not KEKW
