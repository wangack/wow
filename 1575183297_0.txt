[0:40:21] avraan93: monka is isane
[0:40:35] Dech93: @sakredd3 i heard he was kicked from echo for attitude
[0:40:35] namedaccount: Nelf could be to shadowmeld final boss' beam. It makes him skip the cast completely
[0:40:40] PrinceLuTen: and second boss leaps
[0:40:49] mariqlol: also for kujo
[0:40:54] hulkomania: @omniscientautoma going casual = still playing, taking a break = not playing for a while
[0:40:59] ConcernedGaming: are individual players still allowed to stream TGP like they were in the past?
[0:41:11] nikasaur: EU teams monstrously good, a treat to watch this weekend

[0:41:44] spacejamk: @Tyskeeen Yep
[0:41:45] TheAlexOlsen: i quote fragnance "- Not raiding with Echo any longer. I¬¥ve been really busy in my personal life this year, and as a result I was asked to retrial after the race. In all honesty I didn¬¥t fully commit to the retrial, I¬¥m in the middle of moving country and my efforts/priorities"

[0:56:27] HakiThunderFox: @Biziflex they also have different keys and affixes that make some keys way easier or harder

[1:04:01] brotan123: well this pull ain't dying
[1:04:03] Noxiirea: caster cursed , gj
[1:04:10] ModeraYsera: @nothanksimfine yes, they are working with a delay and they cant help it most of the time, its just something youll have to get used to
[1:04:25] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: theye
[1:04:25] Ziracc: lock doing 200k after nerf, i think this means mage should be nerfed
[1:04:34] Destiny191: @ssjbestsacjk xddd
[1:04:35] brotan123: so was this worth or not monkaHmm
[1:04:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pirate dragon!
[1:04:52] krispi143: @Ziracc nerf bear i think
[1:04:53] Moobot: Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[1:04:53] brotan123: where is dratnso the split comparator
[1:04:53] nikasaur: oh my stars
[1:04:54] TemNoc: actually a bit careless to lose purgatory there, he had no rune weapon up monkaHmm
[1:05:07] nothanksimfine: @nothanksimfine @benevolentautoma I guess that makes sense :)
[1:05:10] NTeiras: mage did below tank dps because of the death so i dont think so
[1:05:11] avraan93: nice big pull but not Worte for bl
[1:05:12] Riicky_tv: riicky9Skal
[1:05:20] dethbybunnies: @WolfyGT99 they dont have pi
[1:05:21] Destiny191: @WolfyGT99 haha
[1:05:21] bosscoffee_: @Ziracc you should work at blizzard, you've nailed their logic and thinking! :D
[1:05:26] DhuumFPS: @WolfyGT99 Shaman doesn't have PI so it's trash.
[1:05:27] Ëä•Êú´Ê≤ºÊæ§: @WolfyGT99 fea , pi priest just way better
[1:05:28] Namarot: Demo seems to be the better choice over the Fire Mage
[1:05:29] neels_ofc: Mage was single targetting the nathrezim
[1:05:30] Schnudelie: damage done by moad. gachiGASM
[1:05:34] Steamweaverr: Check out the 3Pods timer, they're in the same key. wow!
[1:05:54] AverageDaeg: @Schnudelie all squirrel MC lol
[1:06:06] mediumimike: what DOA is casting wow? holy legend
[1:06:10] FloydaxTV: @Schnudelie Dich sieht man auch √ºberall oder ?
[1:06:16] ArnesMeyer: thaner team is better in gambit
[1:06:17] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: are fire mages using sun king leggo?
[1:06:21] moderatygos: doa is our host and we're so excited he's here to share all his boomer stories
[1:06:25] Schnudelie: FloydaxTV yo hiiii
[1:06:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Ziracc that's not how you balance, esp TGP for "time". If you're going to nerf PvE aspects, esp abilities / traits / perks, while the M+ remains with current time, it will be even harder for ppl to time these dungeons.
[1:06:30] CrerisRs: @mediumimike ye he has been the panel host for a few events now
[1:06:32] svecchione: @the_SAVCXX_NXMAD always
[1:06:36] Schnudelie: DaegTV so what? LOL
[1:06:42] FloydaxTV: @Schnudelie Hellooo :D
[1:06:43] Sintry123: I think Echo will almost match Monka's Hooktail split
[1:06:47] ssjbestsacjk: they are like 1min behind 3 pods
[1:06:52] Reydien: so monka pulled hooktail at 17:05, finished 20:28, pulled so'leah at 23:53
[1:07:00] DrakeDuude: did he just go "arr" like a pirate? lol
[1:07:01] Ziracc: @I_DoctorSatan_I thanks for the explanation, i really needed that
[1:07:05] Thoreya: LUL
[1:07:06] mediumimike: @crerisrs oh thats cool
[1:07:08] shumlexd: why are they casting levitate on the warlocks?
[1:07:09] elhanchoow: damn did depleto patrol lose?
[1:07:11] AverageDaeg: @Schnudelie its so good kekw
[1:07:13] cutiesxd: meeres aint a main mage
[1:07:16] Steamweaverr: @Reydien thanks for the splits
[1:07:26] anybantergoing: @shumlexd thats antumbra's effect
[1:07:26] muse_less: hmmm xyro
[1:07:28] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: xyroni is biased
[1:07:31] Oakdarkness: madge
[1:07:31] AverageDaeg: @shumlexd its from antumbra weapon, it's not levitate
[1:07:32] Noxiirea: but Meeres just died at the begining of the pull, isnt it an important thing to considere? x)
[1:07:39] moohuu: @elhanchoow yyeah, but with an absolutly epic finale
[1:07:39] TemNoc: @cutiesxd from what ive seen meeres is a main everything LUL
[1:07:42] bosscoffee_: @I_DoctorSatan_I haha, yeah, imagine balancing the game for the top 2% of the audience
[1:07:45] avraan93: Do you think echo will Catch up to monks?
[1:07:48] Thdlock: always said demo is 3rd best after hunter destro no one believed me :)
[1:07:50] ssjbestsacjk: @cutiesxd still topping the meters
[1:07:56] Klamgran: what equip is wolfdisco running, can i see that anywhere ?
[1:08:03] ModeraYsera: @Klamgran !gear click on the individual key level for the run you want then click the left arrow in front of the player names to see all the gear, rio updated it
[1:08:03] Moobot: @Klamgran Leaderboard and Gear Info: https://blizz.ly/RaiderIO

[1:08:17] Klamgran: !gear
[1:08:17] brotan123: echo straight up wasting an hour
[1:08:20] Steamweaverr: @Thdlock Do you even play warlock? ;)
[1:08:21] thunderioum: omg gingi didnt die Kappa
[1:08:22] Schnudelie: DaegTVi know. im trying this as well but my pug tanks running away from it or the squirrels running past by me and then 0 dps Sadeg
[1:08:25] TemNoc: @Thdlock ppl just didnt wanna ruin the game on live servers for other classes who will get even less invites if teams run double WL :D
[1:08:27] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: thd, fire 4th?
[1:08:28] chubahi: Sadge
[1:08:32] Schnudelie: peepoSad *

[1:08:41] AverageDaeg: @Schnudelie lol ooooof
[1:08:44] moltencrucible: @Thdlock will echo time this +32 gambit?
[1:08:55] brotan123: no shot they are trying KEKW
[1:09:03] ArnesMeyer: no
[1:09:08] Reydien: if they omegapull the last room and don't wipe
[1:09:10] qtsage: 3 pods and speed kinda pumping
[1:09:10] Schnudelie: DaegTV its so frustrating if you see them running past by you ratkinKEKWXD
[1:09:21] brotan123: last boss is 6 min alone
[1:09:27] dethbybunnies: RIP 3 chest for echo
[1:09:28] wimpeh: who's casting this?
[1:09:30] roldy27: i mean at worst echo loses like 5min if they keep going
[1:09:40] Reydien: 23:53
[1:09:42] I_DoctorSatan_I: @bosscoffee_ makes ZERO sense to nerf PvE esp for timed, don't matter if it's only 2% of ppl doing this. This only makes these M+ possible with the current damage from class/spec...don't mean the rest of the 98% of "casual" players need to get nerf'd bc only 2% can do this.
[1:09:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, 3 Pods is rocking out
[1:09:51] CrerisRs: no shot they time it

[1:11:27] Steamweaverr: @heresjohnnny the time it takes to go from killing one boss to killing the next boss
[1:11:33] Reydien: meanwhile monka quietly just rocking out their +28 workshop, no deaths.  they took the flying robot at 13:46 their last run, so only 1:25 behind
[1:11:38] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: echo will time it if they all drank their Gingi Juice before key
[1:11:43] CrerisRs: @heresjohnnny I missed the context but if its in context of time, it should mean "boss splits", basically time at which they killed the boss. Its a speedrunning term
[1:11:45] bosscoffee_: @I_DoctorSatan_I brother, theres a game and an audience outside of this that would like to see better and more frequent balancing, its up to blizzard to figure it out and yet they never do.
[1:11:48] Hastif: there is just no way they time this

[1:12:33] I_DoctorSatan_I: @bosscoffee_ i agree with that statement
[1:12:34] rogueous: They said same thing about monka
[1:12:37] Reydien: monka hit 40% at 26:1, hadn't used bloodlust yet
[1:12:38] steelwill66: dint doubt Echo they will pull dmg from nowhere lol
[1:12:50] Sintry123: Echo are going to drink some Gingi Juice and increase dps by 30%
[1:12:52] Reydien: Monka hit phase 2 at 26:10, and still had their lust
[1:12:56] just_adz: Curator is just the worst boss in season 4. Less bad since the AoE visual fix but still... kalamaziMald

[1:50:16] Reydien: if they wanted to 3-chest, I think they probably wanted those 15 seconds, and restarting would only cost like 2 minutes, so I think their goal is just 2-chest

[1:56:28] Reydien: echo ahead by 14 seconds after kujo.  they might be able to get the 3-chest.  question is, does that actually help if Monka gets the +32?

[1:59:01] brotan123: @Ciadric they failed their 32 lower last night
[1:59:03] Sintry123: @physicscreature The whole idea is to play to best comp. If this is the best comp to get the best performance. Why wouldn't they?

[2:04:30] AverageDaeg: @amexpog because they start at 26.
[2:04:32] Reydien: looks like Echo is on time to 3-chest the +26, question for commentators is "how much does it really help if Monka times this +32?"
[2:04:35] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: why blizz bring back mechagon instead of freehold?

[2:39:21] psircyen: @nathanonfire were talking about meta.. so the 5%.. not the 95%..
[2:39:28] Ikitoro: @Nathanonfire If the best veng DHs in the world havent timed a 30 on live by now, you know they are infeiror to other tanks.
[2:39:32] yamsjr: @Timpuzgaming we'd see everyone running the 2nd best tank and some combo of rogue mage and hunter
[2:39:34] sharpps: @Timpuzgaming That would not be fun, because we're here to see the highest keys. Its not a class showcase, in fact classes arent relevant. Its about how they time the highest keys.

[2:47:05] Moobot: Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[2:47:06] psircyen: If your bad at the game I guess..
[2:47:07] yamsjr: how long do they get to push
[2:47:09] amexpog: @psircyen you can literally time 25's as feral and moonkin, so youre only handicapping if it was 27+
[2:47:13] muse_less: fotm chasing wont matter for the majority of the playerbase key goals lol
[2:47:14] Anonamon1: just become familiar with them 4head
[2:47:20] Loranis: i mean if they dont want to thats ok, i thought they werent allowed. just interesting i imagine drjay would have a huge amount of viewers doing so
[2:47:28] Sleepypan: hmm i dont know what word it blocked me from sending :(
[2:47:44] idkEric_: @yamsjr 5h x 3days
[2:47:49] Reydien: Monka finished Kujo at 9:42 in their +30
[2:47:50] moderatygos: the players may not want to show strats, or they may not want the distraction of their stream
[2:47:51] hajtaur9: Echo no WR‚Äôs lol
[2:47:55] izomo: gigachads not playing?
[2:48:01] moderatygos: gigachads is on break
[2:48:04] ditino_medio: Anyone knows why Ricky is not playing anymore with Drjay as they are playing with Splat (never heard about him)?
[2:48:06] Sleepypan: i saw a 14 in premades asking for a full meta comp and laughed LUL
[2:48:06] Nogiskits: also you don't need to play fotm unless you're aiming to do what these guys do.
[2:48:21] LilPorkys_ttv: @chat i havent been keeping up with wow lately, have they said anything about everything being acocunt wide for playing alts in dragonflight?
[2:48:23] Prophet001: dang monka is blasting
[2:48:32] ask_peter: @Loranis that is a problem in chat. ppl just assume something instead of asking.
[2:48:39] Nathanonfire: @Nogiskits if you dont know how to play the class correctly no matter what you play you wont do what these guys do
[2:48:47] yamsjr: @ericidk_ ty, so today being the last day how many more hours do they have left now
[2:48:53] Deviation_BigD: @jdo_porky why would they do that during atournament? lol
[2:48:56] moderatygos: they have 2 hours 44 minutes
[2:48:58] brotan123: dragonflight will be the most alt friendly expansion ever, like SL and bfa before
[2:48:59] Ziracc: monka deplete
[2:49:08] Loranis: @ask_peter i thought i heard someone say players are not allowed to stream it, guess i was misinformed

[2:55:37] baZleicious: wow, what class diversity... can't wait until SL is done
[2:55:48] Nogiskits: @tankholdw you can play any spec on your 20's :)
[2:55:50] minihansen12: Why would u spend a gcd on casting levitate on pods and speed warlock?
[2:55:52] Sleepypan: the lack of variety in this isnt why u cant do a 10+ LUL
[2:55:53] olivoilolja: LUL
[2:56:17] IlllIlIIlllIlIIl: not him LUL
[2:56:19] Naesam: this happens every expansion and yall say the same thing, there will always be a best comp dont be surprised when competitive groups use that
[2:56:19] brotan123: there is no levitate its the weapon effect
[2:56:23] moderatygos: there is some latency issues that causes them to talk over each other, it isn't intentional

[2:56:47] relaxbechill: lmao what is this trash
[2:56:48] Ziracc: actual lay on hands every use
[2:56:48] dragoon2k: @Nogiskits Problem with that is all the players that blindly follows the meta, like half the wow population believe that only BDK is viable for +15 to +20 right about now
[2:56:49] yamsjr: dk LUL
[2:56:55] CrerisRs: @baZleicious cant spec stack so it wont be all evokers
[2:56:58] baZleicious: @baZleicious LUL
[2:57:09] Reydien: monka was 16:19

[2:57:24] peeri: its not a new thing that blood dks can solo stuff, they been doing that for ages
[2:57:24] Nogiskits: @dragoon2k yeah but that's a community issue

[2:57:30] SnockyAU: @tankholdw why would you watch 30s for variety lmao
[2:57:31] wintexx: @dragoon2k bruh im a prot pal and i basically get insta invited anyway
[2:57:39] Sleepypan: people just want to blame a competition for the reason they cant do keys in a spec not showcased here
[2:57:56] Sleepypan: Blood dk been soloing bosses since M+ began LUL
[2:58:05] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: rogue is more st though right?
[2:58:13] psircyen: Chat depleting 15s blaming it on meta LUL
[2:58:13] Reydien: monka pulled King Mechagon at 19:49 and finished him at 24:40
[2:58:38] Sleepypan: anyone remember high tyranical Halls of valor?
[2:58:58] Nathanonfire: @gdzie_jest_wojtyla outlaw is AOE
[2:58:59] psircyen: monkaW
[2:59:04] Boopmeep: @blinkeys L
[2:59:21] Naesam: @tankholdw there is plenty of creativity, playing a comp that isnt quite as good isnt "creativity"
[2:59:25] Reydien: echo pulled king about 30 seconds faster than monka, so they have a solid buffer at this point
[2:59:43] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: @Nathanonfire capped to 5 doe, i would have expect the uncapped hunter to be better at it instead of st
[3:00:10] CrerisRs: @Naesam you are wasting your time arguing with them
[3:00:11] blinkeys: @Boopmeep L
[3:00:20] moderatygos: guys lets be civil please
[3:00:24] Deviation_BigD: @tankholdw it is literally a tournament, and u expect to see them trying classes? my god...
[3:00:30] Sleepypan: @gdzie_jest_wojtyla isnt survival caped to 8
[3:00:48] Hadokenryu: Yo hab mir nen Curry-Dattel Dip ausm LIDL geholt. Schmeckt mega gut
[3:00:51] iamsteverose: i just ate some chicken nuggets. they were great
[3:00:54] moderatygos: tournaments often do not reflect how the live game is played because these players are trying to min/max as much as possible to win
[3:00:58] Hadokenryu: fc
[3:00:59] Hive_wow: if they re ti4ed on the key level is it based on time thne?
[3:01:00] Sleepypan: i wil behave i dont want the ban hammer again KEKW tho one of them wasnt my fault
[3:01:01] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: @Sleepypan soft cap, rogue is hardcapped unless they changed blade flurry and i missed it
[3:01:06] Reydien: echo still about 30 seconds ahead of monka on the start of P2
[3:01:12] eclip468: creativity is in routing, use of dungeon mechanics, trinkets, etc
[3:01:16] Saithe96: @iamsteverose i had some donuts

[3:04:44] Chillcitysnipz: +2 pog
[3:04:51] dragoon2k: I still feel like Echo is the most likely team to pull out aa 32 in one of the three harder dungeons
[3:05:00] Axestro: pretty huge.
[3:05:02] NTeiras: big
[3:05:02] shitnooo: what does wr mean?

[3:05:12] brotan123: so where do echo go now monkaW
[3:05:19] Zahnster: what was the priest mind controlling?
[3:05:24] dragoon2k: the 32 for sure
[3:05:24] Whackster: Warm roast
[3:05:25] CrerisRs: @brotan123 32 Workshop
[3:05:26] iamsteverose: workshop
[3:05:30] moderatygos: the technician that spawns the squirrel
[3:05:31] pnavara: echo is  going 32 workshop
[3:05:32] wintexx: echo 32 work and then go next i guess
[3:05:33] JBarlak: And w never mind controlled that squirrel last expac
[3:05:35] Kuroz: meeixS @TutzorTV
[3:05:38] just_adz: @dragoon2k They were already super close in lower kara yesterday
[3:05:42] wintexx: if monka wipes its pretty equal
[3:05:47] Sleepypan: wait i tried to write wo rld record and it didnt go through?
[3:05:51] Yaebad: @Zahnster tinkeers, theyt have a spell they use that does massive damage
[3:05:52] brotan123: oh true, still gotta do the 32 first
[3:05:54] Chillcitysnipz: @zahnster the add who cast the gigazap thing
[3:05:56] rogueous: If monka get this dungeon i think they will win
[3:06:00] Ikitoro: @JBarlak you didnt use H priest in BFA
[3:06:10] Ignite_CLO: ngl there are some pretty weired banned words in this room
[3:06:23] CrerisRs: @Sleepypan you mean the 30 Workshop? Thats not WR cause Monka has 32
[3:06:32] jenyfear: jenyPain jenyPain jenyPain jenySleep jenySleep jenySleep  bye bye Echo Just show them now
[3:06:34] DScimitar: what does it matter if they +2 or +1 in
[3:06:38] picc0: @Bigbells13 you are doing great!
[3:06:41] Reydien: so, monka 16 minutes into their next run, echo has around 30 minutes of +32 workshop ahead of them.  that puts echo about 45-50 minutes behind Monka, and Gigachad is about 30 minutes behind Echo
[3:06:47] ModeraYsera: @Sleepypan perhaps a typo? it isnt on the ban list and ppl have been saying it alld ay, lol
[3:06:57] rogueous: Still hope for Echo tho
[3:07:05] CrerisRs: @DScimitar if you +1 a 30 you have to go 31, if you +2 a 30 you can go straight to 32
[3:07:06] Chillcitysnipz: @dscimitar faster time meaning more score. +2 means they were super fast
[3:07:07] picc0: @DScimitar time save, a +2 skipps a whole key level that you else have to play
[3:07:07] Sleepypan: @Sleepypan it didnt send my message in the chat said it was against the settings o.o
[3:07:11] Okosnake: !cast

[3:12:11] sniffuu: should be 4 teams from eu and 1 from us and 1 from china in grand final
[3:12:14] Deviation_BigD: @4301gway this is a team based competition, has nothing to do with guilds, for instance lemike and tobo from GIGACHADS r also from echo

[3:12:53] Sinaa: show monka please.
[3:12:58] ModeraYsera: @dellablood its a weak aura, you can find similar on wago io

[3:13:46] wintexx: soo unlucky
[3:13:48] Liryns: ohnooo
[3:13:54] Reydien: during echo's +32 lower attempt last night, they finished Moroes at 23:39, and had 259 count finished at that point
[3:13:56] Bashiel: knight is trolling them hard
[3:13:57] Sleepypan: aww man haha

[3:15:05] haval: @Cyphixoxo when the party is alliance the chess event is orcs-wolves
[3:15:19] Nathanonfire: did you guys know you can watch this on youtube as well
[3:15:30] freyijyey: mods are on a rampage monkaS
[3:15:32] boo_doo: why was that message removed? didnt see anything offensive about it
[3:15:35] Nathanonfire: lots of viewers combined
[3:15:38] Reydien: a bit unfortunate on that timing for the +28 2-chest, they're at risk of not 2-chesting the 30
[3:15:48] Shearin77: @Nathanonfire we know .. we choose not to
[3:15:53] just_adz: Isn't there two different sets of chess pieces, ally and horde. So would make sense for knights to be wolves if the set is a horde version.
[3:15:56] SerThunderbeans: Good question ConcernDoge
[3:16:03] Reydien: echo and monka were around 22.5 minutes, being closer to 25 is not good for gigachad
[3:16:06] Sleepypan: twitch>youtube
[3:16:11] billabong212: all of these teams are sick

[3:17:12] iamsteverose: lol edge
[3:17:27] boo_doo: @dellablood im not 100% sure but I think edge will not have a choice in the matter. chromium (the under-the-hood for edge) is the thing that's gonna change
[3:17:31] Reydien: so monka finished moroes about 44 seconds behind where echo was in their attempt last night.  Echo pulled Attumetn at 30:28, and had 372 forces when they pulled

[3:32:12] Nox1o: @taekwonyoshi depends on what other keys they time. If it comes down to time its not that good to have these scuffed runs (their gambit and this now)

[3:33:11] Honeycrispie: !schedule
[3:33:15] Chillcitysnipz: @methami they are experimenting with this. I do like the shadowlands dungeons better ngl lol
[3:33:17] Sleepypan: @TobiTriade right!
[3:33:17] CrerisRs: @methami we have been running Shadowlands dungeons for 2 years, so they decided to change the m+ dungeon pool for the last season
[3:33:18] Reydien: monka maintains their ~45 minute lead on echo, along with an impressive key echo might struggle to match
[3:33:26] UniqueFlowsnake: @methami what? if the expansion wsa good they wouldnt play the content? what is your point
[3:33:27] Nox1o: if echo does this clean and a good lower than monka needs to win on points because they got bad timers
[3:33:28] cheeky88: how much time do they have left in the day? 2 hours?
[3:33:40] moderatygos: 2 hours
[3:33:42] ModeraYsera: @cheeky88 ~2hrs

[3:34:31] HexaDroid: I wish they would update the expansion dungeons midway or smth, would be more interesting. (new pathways, boss etc)
[3:34:35] Xyronic: @Dendii7 ?

[3:35:07] brotan123: "they can win if everyone stops playing!"
[3:35:08] CrerisRs: @Honeycrispie nothing assuming it doesnt affect global finals seeding, just being more in a comfortable position, not needing to defend your spot as hard(compared to second place)
[3:35:09] CrialexyZ: where is that tettles transition animation now that he makes his appereance
[3:35:19] avraan93: I say my oppinion if monka Lose to echo that will be not fair because the Performance was better from monka s

[3:36:16] Korono22: zaelia only dotting and saving mana for heals?
[3:36:17] iamsteverose: @avraan93 if they lose doesnt that mean that their performance was not better?
[3:36:17] Honeycrispie: @geros2013 ahh affects regional prize money too? cool
[3:36:19] Arisolo: Wait there‚Äôs a new achieve for 0.5%? Last season was 0.1 I thought
[3:36:22] Joshmo18: is today the final day ? so only top 2 move on or is there one more dya
[3:36:30] dragoon2k: nah they will go lower for sure they were so close yesterday

[3:41:54] Sleepypan: Monkagon is that from Mop?
[3:42:02] Reydien: it's not a great metric, but if you multiply their time by 1.08 monka's 29:51 turns into 32:14.  it's gonna be close
[3:42:07] Mac_Twistnether: LaterSooner
[3:42:08] Honeycrispie: @Lofi_Chill mind controlling a mob and using its abilities is a exploit? I dont think so
[3:42:16] moderatygos: @Reydien this is solid logic i love it
[3:42:18] Urebaldd: ConcernDoge
[3:42:20] CrerisRs: @Lofi_Chill if it was an exploit they wouldve probably disallowed it(like Zul skip in Bfa MDI)
[3:42:30] InNecoVeritas: @lofi_chill dude what
[3:42:31] MaMad666: Thanks everyone
[3:42:32] Meeix: @Lofi_Chill nope, its exactly what that spell is for. has been used all of bfa
[3:42:37] vuurmannetje: Its not an exploit, but tbh it should be fixed. Priest just way way way too far ahead of other classes in WS
[3:42:41] MaMad666: <3
[3:42:54] brotan123: actually better to be one shot than silenced 5Head
[3:42:58] Honeycrispie: They are not allowing people to pull Zulgamax through GD wall so clearly this is allowed, and honestly necessary to time
[3:43:04] Reydien: meanwhile giga is about 1 minute behind monka's +30 time, and monka had like 10 seconds to spare

[3:43:54] Meeix: wdym? @PSHllllT i have nothing to do with plagueborers
[3:43:56] vuurmannetje: It is, but it definitly not balanced @UniqueFlowsnake
[3:43:59] zormaan: its ridiculous to use this view when 3 teams are playing
[3:43:59] Honeycrispie: that doesn't mean its a exploit.. what is this logic @Lofi_Chill ..
[3:43:59] Meeix: its literally the priest spell
[3:44:04] lukaripnwx: this chat is more censored than china
[3:44:04] Kelthiz: @Lofi_Chill There's been many mob mechanics that you could MC/spellsteal etc in the past, it's nothing new.

[3:44:07] brotan123: where echo going Susge
[3:44:16] Reydien: monka pulled their +30 king at 19:49 and killed him at 24:40
[3:44:22] Sleepypan: because its literally a class ability that is usable?
[3:44:24] Honeycrispie: @Lofi_Chill this ur first expac? im confused..
[3:44:27] webionda: If this is intended why did they removed the mind control thing on Ingra Maloch in mists?
[3:44:27] StanRaenslen: yea, tiebreaker calculations if they do 32 lower
[3:44:38] r0bswan: how he do that with mc?
[3:44:38] Assirra: @vuurmannetje It's just an utlity spell that priest had since vanilla, this is 1 of the few places it actually has some use.
[3:44:40] NTeiras: no shot they 2 chest
[3:44:53] UniqueFlowsnake: @vuurmannetje it doen't matter for most of the playerbase tho. the dungeon is doable without a priest
[3:44:55] Deviation_BigD: @Lofi_Chill it is a tech that can happen in a single dungeon lol, calm yoself lol
[3:45:06] Zorkwins: F
[3:45:06] Sleepypan: theres also mobs dks can get and do things with LUL should we ban that too?
[3:45:11] brotan123: rip 30+2
[3:45:11] yamsjr: @PSHllllT LUL
[3:45:17] eggman_br: a 33 Pog
[3:45:18] vuurmannetje: @Assirra its not "some"
[3:45:33] brotan123: its probably faster to town portal monkaS
[3:45:34] vuurmannetje: Sorry for the early enter lol
[3:45:36] Honeycrispie: @Lofi_Chill I mean if they want to change it they can.. it hasnt been changed in 4 weeks of use.. so feel like it probably wont be..
[3:45:37] CrerisRs: @webionda thats a good question for comparision, but I dont think anyone in chat would be able to answer this cause none of us are wow devs
[3:45:44] Hurbob14: if you think the mindcontrol tech is broken and should be fixed., you are out of your mind
[3:45:46] kimohunt: Echo probably gonna do upper/GD first and spent the last min to start 32 lower. thats a way for them to win. spending 32 lower now is kinda hard now
[3:45:53] billabong212: imagine not two chesting a 30 Workshop smh
[3:46:06] hekenaattori: The team composition on each dungeon should be randomized
[3:46:07] Honeycrispie: @billabong212 D:
[3:46:10] Kelthiz: People crying cuz a mob's ability shows as priest's damage LUL
[3:46:25] Reydien: 21:18 pull, vs monka's 19:49 pull.  1:30 behind.  Monka started P2 (got stunned) at 21:35
[3:46:27] eggman_br: @billabong212 amateurs, i 2 chest my 10s all the time
[3:46:29] Ignite_CLO: it is the priests dmg
[3:46:30] Assirra: @vuurmannetje It is. Considering how long that spell has been useless it's nice to finally see some use out of it.
[3:46:35] hightestjesus: @loliheke no it shouldnt lol
[3:46:37] kimohunt: that MC thing is clever use of mechanic thats it. been used on BFA, dont see any issue XD. most people cry is cause they are not priest main KEKW
[3:46:37] CrerisRs: @loliheke if you want to see weekly no leavers runs you can just open LFG
[3:47:17] Aro725: No one remembers JB mind controlling the mob before first boss in Mists for huge dam Sadge.
[3:47:18] UniqueFlowsnake: an ability is useful in a niche case? remove it. Kappa
[3:47:20] chadderz7: forsenBased holy monka
[3:47:22] vuurmannetje: Noone is crying tho. People are just pointing out how imbalanced something is. Just because it was in in BFA (when noone but 1 player played priest in high end keys) doesnt mean its balanced now.
[3:47:28] kimohunt: @loliheke ???? wut you just said?
[3:47:29] Pialia: how much time is left for the event?
[3:47:30] Honeycrispie: @kimohunt even worse they are a priest and didn't know LUL
[3:47:35] moderatygos: 1 hour 45 minutes left
[3:47:38] Kelthiz: @loliheke LUL AGREED. There is money on the line here why would they leave it to RNG
[3:47:45] kimohunt: @Honeycrispie thats true KEKW
[3:47:48] JanDeGrote1: @loliheke yeah would be fun seeing people win based on pure rng
[3:47:50] moderatygos: @SivvSins its based on key level, there are some tiebreakers

[3:48:27] kimohunt: but i means its not as broken as you guys think by looking at the timer given. Blizzard probably calculated the time included MC mechanics
[3:48:30] Kelthiz: @SivvSins points is on key level only, timer is tiebreaker after every key's level is equal
[3:48:36] hekenaattori: I meant every team would have the same composition, but it would be random. NoKappa Kappa
[3:48:37] Cyphixoxo: roguetrainHandsup GO MONKA GO roguetrainHandsup
[3:48:56] Theonden42: random team comps could be a fun event, if they are the same for each team per dungeon, but in a competition like this it'd make no sense
[3:49:01] Luzenzo: @Reydien why lie?
[3:49:02] Meeix: theres a very big difference between using an ability for its intended use vs using 3 niche interactions that are not means to be used like this. so no. using mindcontrol is not like plagueborers. MC is comparable to dk control, mage spellsteal etc.
[3:49:05] Athori: i think all classes had their moment in the sun in all wow history it will always be this way
[3:49:09] hightestjesus: @kimohunt Blizz doesnt calculate the time lmao, just look at jy timer
[3:49:11] Kelthiz: @loliheke Still, that wouldn't be a Great Push would it?
[3:49:12] LittleURF: 3==>
[3:49:12] kimohunt: @loliheke but whats the purpose to have random comp? i dont get the point?
[3:49:17] rogueous: Giga gonna 1 chest
[3:49:18] amexpog: gigachads will be top 3 for sure
[3:49:18] CrerisRs: @kimohunt timer is from BFA from before ppl knew the MC strat, the timer is definitely not based on that
[3:49:19] just_adz: Monka doing WS 33??!! Incredible.

[3:52:28] moderatygos: meeix over here farming likes in chat
[3:52:32] kimohunt: @vuurmannetje yeah, no much priest on BFA doing high keys
[3:52:32] geros2013: lol why is the MC thing even a discussion. On live you have 1 Priest that has timed a 30 Workshop at 29 you have Rshaman and Rdruid. MW and holy paladin is at 28. How is this an unbalanced field.
[3:52:35] just_adz: What actually just happened with the pull before tussel tonks there?
[3:52:42] Reydien: monka pulled machinist at 15:31 in their +32, killed him at 18:38.  iirc they had some trouble with the boss, so there's an opportunity to make up time
[3:52:57] Meeix: glad youre enjoying the show guys meeixSip

[3:53:41] Meeix: @just_adz the rocket barrage the pack does kills itself
[3:53:42] gufmeiister: can we not see dps after every key just for seen the overall dmg plzz
[3:53:53] imKennart: If Echo get the 32 lower and neither Echo or Monka time another key. Echo win off timer tiebreaker right?
[3:54:01] sharpps: Moad pretty much is the guy who made the tinket trick famous so ofc hes good at it
[3:54:05] kimohunt: also I have some important exams  starting tomorrow that I planned to study this weekend. But TGP kinda ruined it. gotta watch TGP KEKW
[3:54:15] Sleepypan: @geros2013 because common sense aint common with the general player basis these days LUL
[3:54:16] Kelthiz: @geros2013 Yeah I agree. People overreacting, mind you they also want people to play bottom tier in TGP for class variety SMH
[3:54:26] rogueous: Lets hope echo gets this so its a race all the way out:)
[3:54:32] Assirra: Moad has always been a priest even if it wasn't meta, if 1 person knows all the tricks, it's him
[3:54:40] blazbazerker: @imKennart pretty sure they said monka has the faster junkyard time
[3:54:44] HawkyLR: tfw echo has zero WR's Sadge
[3:54:46] Sleepypan: and then if the teams did play different classes and specs theydd find something else to complain about too LUL
[3:54:47] just_adz: Lmao, ok that's kinda hilarious. kalamaziSeesall
[3:54:50] Daveireland: Rx the most underrated player in this entire tournament - this guy is playing literally every class at R1 level regardless if melee or ranged
[3:54:51] Naguura: the MC isnt easy, but its also not rocket science. The other priests are rly good players, dont think they have a hard time doing it lol
[3:54:57] Sleepypan: u can never win

[3:56:37] iamsteverose: @brotan123 ikr
[3:56:46] UniqueFlowsnake: try pugging the dungeon on priest healer and doing the MC thing and look at your group dying while you're MCing. it's so not an issue that some of the players here can do this. nothing to "fix" here
[3:56:47] rogueous: lust here interesting
[3:56:48] Assirra: @Assirra He is for raiding but if you look at the past MDI and such he plays all the healers.
[3:56:50] vuurmannetje: I think people complained as much about resto druid as they do about priest now tho
[3:57:03] vuurmannetje: the bot just emphasizing their dominance
[3:57:19] Reydien: 18:38 was the time in +32
[3:57:40] myamoray: @vuurmannetje been my experience that folks will complain about anything they think they can, and if there's nothing to complain about, they complain about that, /smh
[3:57:42] Sinaa: TTours
[3:57:43] Daveireland: @dasmartestguy The flower turret only shoots the closest player, so they position that the tank gets hit every time

[4:21:30] Dankind64: 2?
[4:21:35] Reydien: monka is definitely close to their limit
[4:21:39] Seliathan: not much, just bingchilling
[4:21:47] Kelthiz: @dreadfulxz It's not actually the priest's damage, since it's a MC'd mob's ability's damage. Similar to Kyrian weapons in NW.
[4:21:56] Clairfoyance: hpriest not only best healer but brings a must-bring niche ability. this is very balanced LUL
[4:21:57] Str8Klownin: @Boopmeep 24 old dont make me cry .. Flip it 42
[4:21:59] Reydien: Monka pulled king mechagon at 22:35 in their +32, and killed at 28:30

[4:22:22] Boopmeep: i heard assa rogue is bussin anyway :)
[4:22:27] Zmok: Ye we need seli
[4:22:29] brotan123: I don't think this is on pace
[4:22:29] Xyronic: @kunrh sup bud
[4:22:38] Reydien: @Reydien yeah, using it as a comparison.  they had 2 minutes to spare in the +32, and they're 2 minutes behind after the third boss. it's razor-thin
[4:22:39] Kelthiz: @Lofi_Chill Must bring niche ability in an dungeon from an expansion where druid was the overwhelmingly best healer. Yessir
[4:22:46] assrug: can someone tell me what the icons are for the dungeons from top to bottom ?
[4:22:46] Boopmeep: true seli will bring the stonks up
[4:22:55] kunrh: yo xyronics can you correct tettles please that his gigachads need to be 15s faster than echo on workshop take is wrong. hes using gigachads 30 time in that calculation. they actually need to beat their own 30 time by 15 sec

[4:28:30] billabong212: Maiden for echo
[4:28:31] rogueous: that shield was close
[4:28:31] moderatygos: the dungeon choices have been controversial among a lot of people, but blizzard honored the poll results

[4:38:58] Kelthiz: @JuckFrump Highest key is important, 33 wins vs more 32s. So it's monka's game to lose.
[4:39:04] kimohunt: @aboodtkmz Monka + Echo are currently tied on first
[4:39:06] ModeraYsera: @piggybow42 Next weekend
[4:39:08] rogueous: @aboodtkmz Thats the question:)
[4:39:10] Ailenax: drjayHYPERS
[4:39:13] aboodtkmz: Why its the same comp in all 4?
[4:39:24] moltencrucible: thank you guys !
[4:39:30] Mekio77: @aboodtkmz Meta
[4:39:31] Honeycrispie: they are already dead peepoSad
[4:39:33] JanDeGrote1: @aboodtkmz Echo / Monka both have 193 points but i think Echo wins on the tiebreaker
[4:39:33] billabong212: @aboodtkmz it isn't
[4:39:35] kimohunt: @aboodtkmz cause thats what current meta is XD
[4:39:36] Shearin77: @aboodtkmz because it is the best comp
[4:39:44] sniffuu: @Honeycrispie its not tho
[4:39:44] Sir_Flix: @aboodtkmz it's not?
[4:39:47] picc0: @aboodtkmz cause it's the strongest in that kind of competition
[4:39:50] just_adz: @aboodtkmz It's not but ya know.. meta and such
[4:39:51] TooLock: @aboodtkmz cause is the best dps output
[4:39:51] sonartv: echo 100% wins if they time 33 workshop even if monka times it too. if they time grimrail they also have to time workshop if monka does.
[4:39:58] kimohunt: but Echo have a survival instead of mage XD
[4:40:03] zellbrigen_: @aboodtkmz there always have to be a meta comp ;)
[4:40:04] Esatorius: @aboodtkmz why wouldnt it be same combo? its not weekly 15
[4:40:11] Honeycrispie: @sniffuu max doses of copium if u think they have a chance.
[4:40:13] Sir_Flix: @blinkgambler What's wrong with it?
[4:40:19] Kicsako: People should finally understand that pros will play a comp if its 0.00001% better than anything else. This is competetive scene, not having fun

[4:40:28] DempaaldeN: link rules pls

[4:41:15] theorycall: imagine hoping in wow
[4:41:17] moltencrucible: Echo probably don't think they can time workshop and went GD hoping monka does not time
[4:41:19] listrel1: LET'S GO GIGACHAD
[4:41:22] Kelthiz: @sonartv You said 33 but they're in a 32. monka is in their 33 right now is what I meant.
[4:41:23] Thdlock: grimrail is far easier once u kill 1st boss
[4:41:23] Sleepypan: aww thats so sad what were u hoping for @sun_cups
[4:41:23] DarkMatterMVP: !scoreboard
[4:41:30] tesch384: echo rip

[4:41:40] brotan123: at least grim rail is not a hard timer, just gotta live
[4:41:46] UltraSpinach: how*
[4:41:47] jopiiter: all support  sleep?
[4:41:47] Cyphixoxo: We need Dr. Atnos to explain who will win

[4:42:03] zellbrigen_: @aboodtkmz yes, sadly most ppl think what the top does is the only wayr them too
[4:42:04] Sir_Flix: @blinkgambler not at all, I can clearly hear the commentators all the time
[4:42:14] amexpog: they aren't playing dratnos' routes that's why they deplete Kappa
[4:42:37] philogt: anyone got a spare shadowlands key?
[4:42:38] Shearin77: wow that dmg
[4:42:39] ModeraYsera: @jopiiter You are in the wrong place for that, we dont do unbans here. Open a ticket elsewhere, sorry.
[4:42:42] eggman_br: bbye gingi
[4:42:43] brotan123: genji
[4:42:47] sniffuu: ws and gmbt is a race for timer so you notice a deplete 30 min into key, if 1st boss dies in grim its kinda done
[4:42:49] tesch384: a 32 tyranical key in GD is horrorfying
[4:42:49] aboodtkmz: @zellbrigen_ Is that why my feral is not getting accepted in 10s?
[4:42:50] Caprious: gingi floorpov

[5:18:36] PrewtaEU: @sortehenning THere is no 36 key on tournament realm
[5:18:41] Kelthiz: @sortehenning Time wise maybe, not boss damage, and yeah tourney realm can't make 36 keys
[5:18:43] CrerisRs: @sortehenning keys dont go above 35, and bots stop scaling at 30 too so 36 is already probably as hard as this
