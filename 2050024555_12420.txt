[3:32:39] Edeslash: wawa
[3:32:40] SeriousJester: actual cringe
[3:33:00] maplelost: isnt there sod
[3:33:14] GueffelTV: have you backed stormgate?
[3:33:21] SeriousJester: @MightyTeapot you've let me down bad
[3:33:34] tchuckyyyy: Wish of the wow versions has more popular pvp?
[3:33:37] aFlyingGuru: this is the guild leader of our vanilla guild, ditching the guild to do a random rancid heroic clear
[3:33:37] maplelost: its starcraft at home
[3:33:37] Arlinn_Kord_: dh is lame, where is paladin at
[3:33:42] GueffelTV: its basicly a fusion
[3:34:03] GueffelTV: ill backed closed beta starting enxt week i think
[3:34:07] GueffelTV: next*
[3:34:11] Das_Publikum: im more excited for ZeroSpace
[3:34:12] Nike_DnT: why are you stilll doing heroic dont you have all the gear from this
[3:35:14] Edeslash: also it's often fun to play the game and press buttons in instanced pve content
[3:35:27] ciraxa: ITSTIME im logging in to obtain the legendary
[3:35:28] NotYetRatedd: my mage is also pretty rancid still xddTree
[3:35:47] tchuckyyyy: Is gearing in wow as ez as gw2 I'm like playing wine for the first time so I have no idea
[3:35:49] maplelost: how dare life get in the way of wow
[3:35:50] SeriousJester: I think we recleared way too much
[3:36:19] SeriousJester: well yeah
[3:36:22] SeriousJester: reclear takes 3h
[3:36:24] tomdotdll: we need more prog days tbh
[3:36:25] SeriousJester: should not be the case
[3:36:31] aFlyingGuru: @SeriousJester nah we still need the gear, and reclear should be way faster
[3:36:32] tomdotdll: but its understandable why we dont
[3:36:44] Edeslash: reclearing this raid has been pretty chill but the amount of reclears for you was probably high considering the amount of raids you had to cancel
[3:37:01] GameOfLifeMaster: Is it still worth it to start now with WoW?
[3:37:11] peppernull: It's always worth it
[3:37:14] tchuckyyyy: I only play 1 character even in gw2 HEAL SCOURGE
[3:37:22] aFlyingGuru: @GameOfLifeMaster wow is worth to start at anytime because the game basically does a full reset every ~6 months
[3:37:22] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[3:37:37] tomdotdll: roster cm DRAINED
[3:37:45] spruudel: DRAINED
[3:38:05] tomdotdll: bro youve been saying that for half a year ICANT
[3:38:07] Edeslash: from my "outside" perspective i think you've very accurately identified the issue. Unfortunately it's one of the issues of all time
[3:38:23] maplelost: have u tried returning to WoW if you missed the patches? they throw all of them at u at once, no order
[3:38:32] Alenerien: before new expansion is always best time to get in wow since you have basically reset with every expansion
[3:38:38] Glebk0: @maplelost and?
[3:38:49] tomdotdll: OMEGALUL
[3:38:53] PeterLacko: ff 14 pleayrs will erp through the drought
[3:39:00] Das_Publikum: CarlSmile
[3:39:11] SeriousJester: At this rate I'll get to come leech retail too
[3:39:26] peppernull: theres so many catchups now the only thing "gating" you from playing right now is knowledge of dungeons people know after months
[3:39:41] tchuckyyyy: U sould do zero2hero in wow too I watched ur whole z2h in gw2 and it carried my gw2 career
[3:39:48] ViviLouF: Lol this guy is so broken plays WOW I never look u again ur so worse bye im out od
[3:39:51] tomdotdll: Lol this guy is so broken plays WOW I never look u again ur so worse Bye im out od
[3:39:56] maplelost: @Glebk0 and the story doesn't make sense? the content you progress may no longer be relevant? idk
[3:40:34] Edeslash: 5 hours every morning :)
[3:40:49] spruudel: get up early ICANT
[3:40:51] spruudel: Clueless
[3:41:01] NotYetRatedd: lets do keys saturday morning at 9am batJAM
[3:41:12] Glebk0: @maplelost wow story never made sense tbh you are better off watching lore stuff on youtube
[3:41:16] aFlyingGuru: @peppernull yeah its very fast to get decent gear, the thing that bothers me a bit though is you can only get 1 myth item per week (if you dont do alt mythic raid clears)
[3:41:20] maplelost: can they just label the order it releases so you know which one to do first
[3:41:48] tchuckyyyy: U sould do zero2hero in wow too I watched ur whole z2h in gw2 and it carried my gw2 career
[3:41:56] peppernull: Yeah the vault is pretty dog for catchup, then there's crest farming
[3:41:58] Sathenus: forgot cataclysm KEKW
[3:42:17] Edeslash: as a subscriber to this live stream, i AM expecting a full Loremaster achievement playthrough series
[3:42:20] Edeslash: Zero to Loremaster
[3:42:22] Halflings: zero2hero in wow? I'd watch it
[3:42:35] maplelost: hard to get invested into the world and game when you dont know the context for it all, at least for me.
[3:43:11] Nike_DnT: gw1 had it best

[3:44:42] Nike_DnT: the drawback was resources were wasted on leveling areas rather than end game @MightyTeapot
[3:44:52] Nike_DnT: every expansion needed a noob island which was a big drain

[3:52:10] aFlyingGuru: LMAOO vivilouf
[3:52:27] pauls_dog: can you recommend a warrior spec for a new player? like, what's the warrior spec that youre happy to see when they join your group
[3:53:39] Tritophs: is there a specific Ilvl you want to be before getting into heroic and later mythic raids? Or does it not matter that specifically?
[3:55:14] Byrchi: @pauls_dog Fury is decent and  fairly easy to play its just very spammy spec

[3:55:56] Jusatanious: Cant break myself from playing berserker
[3:56:34] ciraxa: first hit Susge
[3:56:38] pauls_dog: i unlocked berzerker and it seems fun but selfish as a dps
[3:56:41] Halflings: "playing wow has been a loser detector" probably why it's better to be a variety streamer.  some games communities get culty
[3:56:44] emecci: berserk on
[3:56:45] Finejeeeeez: what other classes you play?
[3:56:48] pauls_dog: is spellbreaker better because they have more cc?
[3:56:50] Nike_DnT: @pauls_dog you can play as quickness and its quite good
[3:57:12] Finejeeeeez: very cool!
[3:57:23] Regalpower: Nike LOVES pug Warriors in his CMs
[3:57:30] Nike_DnT: @pauls_dog spellbreaker has similar DPS, more CC, a block on demand, slower rotation, and generated perma self stability, and has big self healing
[3:57:45] hatad: will you stream mdi
[3:58:00] pauls_dog: @Nike_DnT thanks
[3:58:17] hatad: warbands
[3:58:20] Bagnasty: Healpot
[3:58:20] eggsandcrumpets: even offspecing is rough cause of weird stat prios n stuff
[3:58:24] Edsah: Someone should have run in and said, Leroy Jenkins!
[3:59:29] Nike_DnT: @pauls_dog all that said, if you really are drawn to berserker and you want to master it, nobody will be mad to have you inthe group so go for it
[4:00:00] hatad: good i want to see vivi die hard
[4:00:04] c0rtexior: Are you playing in the MDI? Or just watching
[4:00:42] tomdotdll: cope comp Gladge

[4:03:39] TrayvonKing: NotLookingAtBooba
[4:03:48] ciraxa: BRH 29 sounds doable
[4:04:18] silimaur: I feel like I would like wow if I could get over the graphics - I know lots of people like them but I just really can't stand them which is unfortunate :D
[4:04:24] silimaur: otherwise it looks enjoyable to me
[4:05:09] silimaur: yeah. it is a timeless artstyle that definitely does well overtime
[4:05:18] aFlyingGuru: plenyx just said the n word
[4:05:23] alinoix: can you explain the meaning of Keyes? just playing wow from time to time and not planning to do any end content but enjoying watching so would like to understand
[4:05:27] niko_is_bad: Is there a way to get into rise without a key
[4:05:29] niko_is_bad: @MightyTeapot
[4:05:31] Bagnasty: ya but WoW has f. goblins
[4:06:19] Bagnasty: @niko_is_bad you have to do the whole infinite without a key no?
[4:06:24] melleehhx: Also worth to note that the key you use for the dungeon either gets upgraded or downgraded based on if u complete it
[4:06:31] TrayvonKing: How is the music always so good in this game peepoJAMMER
[4:06:31] c0rtexior: Would you say that the combat system in WoW is better than GW2?

[4:08:18] Finejeeeeez: i love the legendary weapon visuals and looks in gw2 over wow

[4:08:45] DukemNukemGaming: fashion wars 2
[4:08:55] Glebk0: gemstore wars 2
[4:09:01] silimaur: I just got hard baited by an EOD CM group asking for KP that when I finally checked does not have any KP (well one of the 9 of them had some and it was clearly a guild training)
[4:09:14] silimaur: 25 mins since I left and they still have not cleared first strike
[4:09:16] BrutalHermit: THe gear in GW2 is a muddled mess. Everyone just looks like a glowing blob of pixels
[4:09:20] Uno_Kahuno: I have found MMOs graphics grow on you as you play it.
[4:09:47] SeriousJester: @MightyTeapot you need to come next raid, we wiped 3 to the turtle cause people wont unboon
[4:10:48] pauls_dog: ghamoo-ra the guild breaker lmao

[4:18:38] Nike_DnT: yeah if youre one of the 3 people who still speed runs dungeons just craft ascended
[4:18:45] aFlyingGuru: yeah for weapons legendary has a bit of a reverse qol meme in certain situations but

[4:23:33] Nike_DnT: tbh Anet should pay for it

[5:49:05] Tritophs: are old raids from previous expansions actually still playable somehow? Or is all that content just gone forever? Like if I start playing in a few months, will I not be able to play this boss ever again?

[5:50:13] Edeslash: @Tritophs you can play the boss later, it becomes trivial quite fast, and soloable in a couple of years
[5:50:24] hatad: @Tritophs you can play all old content but is easy mode then
