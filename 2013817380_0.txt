[1:04:26] syNcis21: wait, it feels bad?
[1:04:27] kohdz: its so they could have destruction be the same for everyone
[1:04:27] Thiole: harder to do wallhacks with server side
[1:04:28] seismicxfm: If the massive destruction happened client side, our CPUs would melt :D
[1:04:29] digikid: it's prob cause it's server authoritative
[1:04:29] Gracjaan: How's all server side when I had infinite ammo cheater in my last game?
[1:04:37] Visvge: everything being in the server would make cheats harder to create, but i'm still seeing some wild cheats like permanently invisible heavies or aim lock
[1:04:39] Mr_Awperson: destruction on this scale on multiple clients would be awful for consistency
[1:04:42] TheDarkD_: i read everything is server side so all destruction and lighting is the same
[1:04:44] mattlull: @Protomateria I remember calling ATT and they straight up told me to get COX in my area. I think they just divide up areas to each other in Cali
[1:04:48] Shadowfax71: the fact that cheating is still a problem is kinda sad
[1:04:48] dylansrose: the fact that its all server side does mean they can do more'
[1:04:50] naoconhecldo: @Thiole not really, the game still needs to store the player positions
[1:04:50] witse4w: any1 knows how u get ur skins from the beta to the game or is it impossible

[3:52:07] Kev_Nasty: @The_ToneJo Not a bug, it's straight up a beanbag at close range cracking your skull and killing you.
[3:52:15] reported_thischannel: @ShaddyDaShadow no, what's going on there
[3:52:28] robojae: bean bag at far range in the nuts lethal or not?
[3:52:28] Pai_Xoto: @Kev_Nasty the thing is it doesnt happen every time
[3:52:34] yesimcanadianguy: @Kev_Nasty To the head it would obviously kill

[3:54:02] ThickTeddy: can they free the ones you already have handcuffed?
[3:54:04] yesimcanadianguy: @The_ToneJo The game prizes itself on realistic ballistics. You can even ricochet large rounds and hit yourself or teammates.
[3:54:12] HundiesBundies: you gotta use lethal and try to get S class it‚Äôs so much more fun @shroud
[3:54:16] reported_thischannel: this game is not worth at all at full price
[3:54:17] mydadworksatTwitch: @mickemike bots are offline only but they moght bring them to multiplayer
[3:54:23] j_koh: @Menkhor i havent checked but u can only load one shell at the time
[3:54:28] thepineapplepizzaguy: find out homi!
[3:54:28] Pai_Xoto: @Kev_Nasty i dude it happend to me. im just saying it realy looks like it doesnt happen everytime
[3:54:29] ZorlIin: @robojae nowadays is there a difference between ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù and ‚Äúorganized criminals‚Äù
[3:54:40] Kev_Nasty: @Pai_Xoto Nah you right. It's kinda RNG.
[3:54:40] mydadworksatTwitch: its def worth $50 but i get everything on sale anyway
[3:54:41] robojae: anyone ever want to try getting shot by those bean bags
[3:54:42] j_koh: punch him
[3:54:43] HundiesBundies: lethal S class takes a lot more coordination
[3:54:45] Inkredibehl_: the AI always do the same thing thats so stupid
[3:54:47] lavenderbumble_bee: lmao
[3:54:49] asiakass: @shroud have you tried Tarkov arena
[3:54:53] ynzaen: just send an extra bag when they're fighting to gain composure, if not they'll just shoot again I think
[3:54:56] balaaay: Why is the shotgun so bad
[3:55:02] Menkhor: @j_koh yeah im talkin about the clips. the one clip has 3 full reloads in it, but then that seems to be it
[3:55:06] 5eMen1: confiscate the gun
[3:55:09] Pai_Xoto: maybe you have too shot a numer of time ? @Kev_Nasty
[3:55:12] nolace: @balaaay non-lethal
[3:55:13] Ivanraez: @balaaay non lethal ammo
[3:55:16] TheSwordsEcho: @balaaay bean bag shotgun doesn't really do that much in this game.
[3:55:16] Godger_: ResidentSleeper game Bedge
[3:55:16] jubbjubb1: @balaaay less lethal
[3:55:17] Poisonpicker: @HundiesBundies like getting hit by 10 paintballs all at once out of a hella pressurized gun
[3:55:18] zenval__: @balaaay its nonlethal, meant to take susoects without killing them
[3:55:21] The_ToneJo: @Kev_Nasty ya that's exactly what I use. forgot what mission it was but i kept getting unauthorized use of force when i was using bean bags trying to s tier such a fucking pain in the ass

[4:05:43] JmakLIVE: i was 50 points away from S on this mission cause I beanbagged a guy too much lol
[4:05:51] Chirimoyas__: @zei7geis7 thank you
[4:06:01] GrimWTF: @natefromthesix Can't get S rank if you're lethal
[4:06:04] ZorlIin: @natefromthesix this is like a vegan run
[4:06:07] reed2528: there's no way they can S rank without entering pool area from underground stairs
[4:06:08] HundiesBundies: @grimwtf yes you can
[4:06:17] zei7geis7: monkaGun
[4:06:20] SilentDawn217: they all have kids
[4:06:24] HundiesBundies: @grimwtf if you incapacitate the person it counts towards S class

[5:53:35] AlphaSimply: 20 yeah
[5:53:37] Lucky_Barbarian: bear at 10
[5:53:37] Halzakk: it pumps tho
[5:53:41] YuzukiKaze: plinK
[5:53:44] CodeCrisp: leveling is easy as feral
[5:53:44] IreScath: 10 bear, 20 cat, 30 cheatah
[5:53:47] NamestBane: wf you can get at 14
[5:53:47] Boosticuff: bear with mangle and wild strikes is good too
[5:53:49] ayofouryayo: starsurge claps everything early levels. makes it ez mode
[5:53:54] gvibrator: leveling boomy is kind of fun though
[5:53:54] RedXIII: shroud its best to run starfire, moonfire and starsurge until than. it's fucking OP starsurge SLAPS for leveling
[5:53:57] SorcRogier: NamestBane no
[5:53:58] shreddingog: you can get bear at 10, but it is not fun gameplay at that level
[5:53:59] ilovethemapdust: bear is still okay
[5:54:02] CodeCrisp: i mean as balance* not feral
[5:54:07] silverskum: druid 1-20 is the worst 1-20 in the game
[5:54:09] Wyxzlol: balance will 20
[5:54:10] fakebalmung: !restedxp
[5:54:12] pocketz: lvl 1 starsurge?
[5:54:12] ilovethemapdust: Wild strikes OP
[5:54:22] CodeCrisp: @silverskum nah 1-20 is the fastest now
[5:54:29] blucap_: its slow early level.. better endgmae
[5:54:31] YuzukiKaze: vibee
[5:54:32] EqWallyT: balance with runes is one of the fastest leveling
[5:54:32] Humicrobe: yes its good
[5:54:34] SorcRogier: nah balance until 20 is meta
[5:54:36] RoyerXIV: it's good
[5:54:36] biggieshmallz: melee weaving is pretty viable rn
[5:54:36] Joonsoo_: Its okay
[5:54:36] shreddingog: lacerate, yes, it is good for threat, not for killtime
[5:54:38] E11evated: boomkin i was better to level
[5:54:39] AlphaSimply: nah with starsurge its op from 1-20 so faswt
[5:54:39] Chumychum: its bad but its fun lol
[5:54:46] Dreamfl0w: @shroud there is a melee with beastmastery currently popping off. really hard to master and needs specific comp
[5:54:50] NamestBane: @ecaftsohG yeah i had it at 14 on my druid
[5:54:51] CodeCrisp: they buffed starsurge so leveling is ridiculous on druid
[5:54:51] AlphaSimply: Hydra hit like 25 in 15-20 hrs
[5:54:53] Denz0TV: top hunter parses all melee weave, but not full melee
[5:54:55] miztertea1: melee weave competes with bm

[5:55:03] Hotlinks: its pgood
[5:55:05] FrostKngTV: melee hutner

[5:55:08] Hotlinks: weaving is better tho
[5:55:12] DudeInTheBlack: Full Melee Hunter is wanted but all the new melee hunter abilities suck
[5:55:22] Optimisprimerib: no, its not cool!
[5:55:25] Dreamfl0w: @shroud there is a melee with beastmastery currently popping off the meters. Not weaving, actually melee. Really hard to master and needs specific comp.
[5:55:36] shreddingog: @DudeInTheBlack they still outdps ret pala :D
[5:55:43] NamestBane: @ecaftsohG i wasnt talking about cat form XD
[5:56:04] LachyJB10: wait what class are you doing now shroud

[5:56:33] runnzgunz: Icy Veins?
