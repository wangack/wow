[1:27:29] GodKingMuninn: its hella interesting
[1:28:00] JLmorten: The best mouse regarding buttons etc is the Logitech G600 but the shape of this makes my hand hurt. There Corsair muse is better. But do not like the thumb buttons on it.

[1:28:34] Blvdman: echo

[1:29:36] Blvdman: well when you do keys 24/7 u learn things xD
[1:29:54] CptKilljoy: snapping is a mechanic now, so kinda just falls under clever use of game mechs, no?
[1:29:59] biirrd: IF you let the MD ran out in the dungeon, its permenet on the target. It ha been like this for a long time.
[1:30:27] Streamcrush: I use the G602 wireless, amazing battery life, plenty of buttons for games like WoW
[1:30:27] Blvdman: Thats why they saved Plaguefall for last because I assume if they did it on day 1 or 2 blizz probably would have patched it
[1:31:12] h3llgum: that has happened to me before , is there a low lvl in your grp

[1:32:51] Lentgel: @Towelliee Yoda and dorkie said that they knew it was possible and they had practiced it aswell.. but didnt find a way to make it work.. hence made it unsafe.. also they didnt know if it was viable for higher keys
[1:32:55] Raanu98: everyone saved pf for the last day tho, i think it's mostly because they didnt want to give away their tactic just like the Fungelmancer strat from the other team
[1:33:27] Blvdman: Also keep in mind I don't think bliz would like to start handing out punishments on their first Great Push tourny lol
[1:33:34] GodKingMuninn: Double tank meta just goes to show why AoE cap is bad imo

[1:35:34] TheEnstraynomic: would that tournament being streamed on twitch also have anything to do with that, given the youtube exclusivity that they signed last year?
[1:35:35] akia03: wasnt it also because it was new that more people watched
[1:35:36] JLmorten: But it need to get te f.. out of Youtube.

[2:28:11] officialviz: Missed my two year @Towelliee Sadge
[2:28:12] Lutheria: @Towelliee I am thinking about boosting something for Hammer Squad, already have a Pally in there. What would you recommend / what do we need more of?
[2:28:15] Shrenko: no launch timer @Towelliee !!?
[2:28:22] Gosera: Spreadsheet + Thotbott was your friend back in the day, Attune does all of it in one
[2:28:30] lalllare: Hi Bono!
[2:28:33] frostym1: whats your minimap addon ?
[2:28:39] mwsoldier: Looking forward to the Fel Reaver ganks LUL
[2:28:50] Exodeo_: For someone like me that didn't play TBC  properly Attune is amazing lol
[2:28:59] CannonfodderTV: Addons were a thing in TBC.
[2:29:08] Foxhoundn: Is the boosted gear really that bad? I was thinking about giving BC a try since I loved the expansion, but in no way I have the time to level up from 0.
[2:29:12] Gosera: @CannonfodderTV It has always been a thing
[2:29:13] Shrenko: @CannonfodderTV yes but very minimal
[2:29:14] PvtHudson093: I was using Ct_raid assist, decursive,Pallypower and grid in TBC
[2:29:20] Virus2508: WAs is the best addon
[2:29:20] drfarringt0n: oh yes, I remember pallypower
[2:29:21] Lheela: In tbc we had power auras too, no reason not to use weak auras

[2:29:52] ooprahwindfury: best addon ever was autotravel during early days of vanilla 😅
[2:29:57] Gosera: Boosted Gear is extreamly bad, the blue pvp gear is almost 300% better then what you get
[2:30:01] F3aR_Insomnia: hey dude, my PallyPower hasn't worked since the prepatch, did yours recently update or?

[3:10:36] Gosera: @YasudoCZ Pve is alliance based becuse of racial and thats why,  Horde is more PvP thats why they are more dominate on thouse servers
[3:10:40] thehennyhennyshow: what time will tbc come out?
[3:11:04] Shrenko: its worth dealing with the server issues, if you think about the long term
[3:11:04] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[3:12:47] hammack52: im not expecting a long que on pagel
[3:12:49] Steamro11r: in BGs he always calls the alliance  the horde
[3:12:52] Motivess: My server dropped to medium/low end of cata and has hovered there since on retail, it sucks, especially when the expansion content runs dry, dead cities, I'd rather deal with a que short term than a dead server halfway through
[3:12:57] rominos88: @Scoodles91 What is this for app?
[3:12:57] itsmiraix: Anyone knows how it’s gonna be with glad? 1% of server or realm pool for the Titel?

[3:13:15] CannonfodderTV: Only time I'm encountering queues is when I get booted from the server.
[3:13:15] Lemonsqze: LUL
[3:13:16] Gosera: @YasudoCZ Make sense, but yeah Gehanaz on eu has a massive horde present so its very unlikly to be gank but there is a chance
[3:13:17] tarot_with_tricia: Atiest is gonna be a long queue

[3:14:17] Gosera: Layer over fresh server
[3:14:25] Ninetailedfox1989: @Towelliee  people will complain about anything anyways
[3:14:39] hammack52: i have been on pagel for the whole of classic, and when the big server got ques we never had anything above an hour, and that is not bad considering i have seen 4+ hour ques
[3:14:39] Urgshnoff: If they have fresh servers they should halt transfers and boosts on those
[3:14:46] bruhSit_farmer: yea classic blew expectations out the water
[3:14:49] bruhSit_farmer: what an event
[3:14:53] xRaZoNx: dont forget to learn axes

[3:15:47] Ramdorpser: The hype is there but it will only last a short period of time compared to Classic where it took a bit of time for it to chill.
[3:15:50] Gosera: TBC is my fav expansion, but compared to Classic it doesnt carry the same hype at all, heck even blizzards own "trailer" is less hype

[4:20:54] ninousT: fortnite started all of this
[4:20:55] ninousT: Kappa
[4:20:58] Loranis: still hoping they wont bring a token
[4:20:58] nisuunlite: still cheaper to buy from gold seller aint getting banned either way
[4:21:03] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:21:04] TettixHD: what is rmt?
[4:21:08] idenkaz_: KEKW
[4:21:14] Buckwink: AoC combat looks really clunky to me
[4:21:14] at1c: Its safer for anyone who plays wow that tokens are there.
[4:21:18] BrojaTV: focus on things you can control lol its decent life advice in general
[4:21:18] Bazsidiver: but the dont have monthly sub
[4:21:21] Meow56: Once I saw a MMO in a store BegWan
[4:21:22] Brodih_: real money transaction @TettixHD
[4:21:23] ShadoodHD: COSMETIC store Kappa
[4:21:23] ShadyWizWolf: I quit WoW for WoW
[4:21:24] idenkaz_: @TettixHD real money trading
[4:21:24] Dookeyy: Just dont look at the store
[4:21:24] GoKu1g: Amen!
[4:21:24] croppeast: RMT = Real Money Trade for those who asked
[4:21:29] bakkich: The problem i have with it, its when you can get an advantage with real money, rest is whatever
[4:21:30] grubratt: boosting will be rampant if they add tokens. Pvp will mirror retail pvp.
[4:21:30] ShadoodHD: there's a difference Keepo
[4:21:33] spanij: even new world is going to have strore
[4:21:36] Wildside1177: I cannot wait to try those games, then about a month later I'll see you all back in WoW. :)
[4:21:40] nightmayor12: real money AH on diablo 3 felt bad tho
[4:21:41] sphynx_rayne: I work to much to care. I come home and play when i can so I don't care
[4:21:43] TettixHD: ah ok, thanks!
[4:21:48] Teppo_lul: mortal online :)
[4:21:51] Truedusk: towelliee spitting facts
[4:21:54] vlaxx905: @Towelliee True..if you enjoy the game regardless...who cares if there's a store.
[4:21:55] corrosivecamden: im gonna make my own game with no store it will cost 300 dollars
[4:21:55] xthatguy24: I buy tokens to get gold bc the grind can be unbearable imo
[4:21:58] Eviltuna13: I dont care anymore but i will go on a 45 min rant about it everyday rooWut
[4:22:05] d3rd00mb00mt: exactly, and future games will be even more about mta and stuff, good im old and these are the last games for me and i dont play them competetove anymore like back then
[4:22:06] Ponas91: runescape doesnt have a store
[4:22:09] fewyn: he's got the good stuff
[4:22:14] Meow56: Some shady trading going on
[4:22:18] KragnosWoW: runescape has a store lol
[4:22:21] Bohb: Probably gonna get flamed for this, but I could make 10x the money by working extra for the time it takes to level versus boosting
[4:22:21] Ponas91: what
[4:22:25] ShadoodHD: the stuff that takes you to the moon KEKW
[4:22:25] Butanogas: So, good morning there! a hug from Brazil
[4:22:28] KaisenSiru: pieLab
[4:22:36] GoKu1g: the things in the store should be obtainable ingame though without money
[4:22:37] croppeast: @Towelliee I dont mind stores tho, who sell Cosmetics, effects, mounts etc. I just hope most of them keep XP boosts, money buying, ingame "power". But ur right thom, its come to stay
[4:22:38] SavageCheez: I like Cartel Coins =D
[4:22:40] d3rd00mb00mt: @butanogaz hug from germany ♥
[4:22:54] Frank4LuLz: yup, Swtor was a bummer, almost as bad as Wildstar
[4:22:54] xthatguy24: can u duel him??
[4:22:58] TheGaoSora: Dualboxing.... jfc
[4:23:03] grubratt: I dont care much about the coins, I hate how the players end up treating the coins and instead of playing the game they treat the game as a full time job and only sell carries and boosts for players for gold/real money.
[4:23:13] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, the things in the store are obtainable with gold
[4:23:17] jerktroop: What server is this?
[4:23:21] akia03: hes rping as your bodyguard
[4:23:25] d3rd00mb00mt: @Frank4LuLz dont forget sW galaxies, EQ2 AOC etc etc they all killed wow
[4:23:28] Azurehax: remember wildstar
[4:23:30] Buckwink: im never going to cry about cosmetics being on the store
[4:23:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:23:34] CannonfodderTV: Well cosmetics are bad.
[4:23:41] SavageCheez: just to complain, because its the meta these days
[4:23:42] d3rd00mb00mt: @Poondog nah cosmetics are irrlevant
[4:23:42] hulkomania: @Conker_x so if you hate people who treat the game as a full time job do you hate all streamers who stream wow?
[4:23:49] sphynx_rayne: I don't get why people care what other people use there money for.
[4:23:51] grubratt: thats not at all the same thing lmfao
[4:23:54] croppeast: @Towelliee What? Oh well. Time to find some sand and put my head in it towKing
[4:23:54] MrClaudeSeaburn: Imagine having fun playing videogame in 2021 WHAT
[4:23:55] spanij: i was so happy when 58 boost was announced
[4:24:02] AtomicHeartSon: Oh man, the cash shop debacle
[4:24:03] Wildside1177: Why the cosmetic hate? Warframe has been doing that for years.
[4:24:03] d3rd00mb00mt: dont read forums or reddit for such things, just play or dont play
[4:24:04] twistedstick1: Because Asmon says they are bad. Ppl want to spend their money. Let them.
[4:24:14] d3rd00mb00mt: like the adults you are
[4:24:17] EpicJune: i would rather just a sub, but some people want no store, not sub, no box price LUL
[4:24:18] SavageCheez: MoAr Mounts!
[4:24:19] ArcaneSyntax: I know SO many people who wouldn't play BC without the boost.
[4:24:23] Shrenko: SWTOR isnt even close to dying
[4:24:30] grubratt: Whenever I log on the game and cant find an arena partner for high mmr games or mythic raiding without being told i need to pay for it thats a problem
[4:24:32] Killerpoe: didnt see these people complaining back when you bought and xpac and a free boost came with it so people should just keep quiet rofl
[4:24:35] d3rd00mb00mt: @ArcaneSyntax yeah me, i bought the boost like 2h ago haha
[4:24:36] sphynx_rayne: @drdoom9000 I never look at that stuff. It makes my head hurt lol
[4:24:37] FutileDiploma: @towelliee waiting till 6pm est tommorrow is gonna be rough.
[4:24:39] at1c: As anything else Vote with your wallet
[4:24:42] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u sure that SWTOR gonna die? :)
[4:24:50] kitkatmeel: what auctioneer addon are you using?

[4:30:50] AtomicHeartSon: gettin' crushed
[4:30:55] turbofreee: @Towelliee Do you know if you can buy a TBC boost for each of your wow accounts under your bnet?
[4:30:56] vanzx: damage / mp5 > defense
[4:30:59] submotion: imagine if blizz didnt limit the boosts per account, i feel like they shot themselves in the foot (moneywise) but it's a nice compromise to the no-change community if you ask me
[4:31:03] Endy253: Are you going to multi tank tbc or just focus pali?
[4:31:08] akia03: @Towelliee why arnt you getting a full quest log with finished quests to get a bump in xp when tbc goes live?

[4:58:35] CritcobainTV: what do u mean if u had something to do? You could be farming Oondasta rn
[4:58:36] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[4:58:36] kaelanDori: Do you think the way people get tired of WoW Retail content so fast these days is just due to the fact the game has been out for 15 years?
[4:58:38] Cafe0le: so many classes in shadowlands are fun, just not enough content in 7 months
[4:58:38] BrojaTV: laps in oribos is my fav tho
[4:58:40] Eviltuna13: i have max covent upgrades and 35k anima. im set until 9.1
[4:58:42] Garrujak: As someone who plays both games (classic and retail) it's kinda good though. No need to worry about missing out on anything retail while TBC launches
[4:58:45] KaisenSiru: I've been through worst. 14 month farming Siege, 12 month ICC.
[4:58:45] Spaede: I’m just mad we aren’t able to sell Deni like we could Nzoth, that was phat gold
[4:58:48] DegenerateHaven: its a shame
[4:58:51] Buckwink: no 9.3?
[4:58:56] StaineGm: i hate the groupfinder in retail, only elitist ppl asking for the best ilvl and achievements. You have no chance to get into a grp
[4:59:00] CritcobainTV: @kaelanDori no, it's because there's been nothing new for like 7 months
[4:59:05] mattmasters96: @Towelliee I agree, and the first expansion thats also considered a "tock" expansion
[4:59:16] mattmasters96: after a previous one*
[4:59:20] Thunderbrew: @StaineGm Agreed
[4:59:21] rhk_: My entire guild is bored of raiding as we need to clear all for vault :/

[4:59:27] Mathhbm: Blizz will say its pandemic fault  LUL
[4:59:34] vanzx: I quit classic to go back to Retail for SL again. I loved SL and played everday. After a while it got really boring with nothing to do. Went back to classic
[4:59:35] Riggoz1: If they would of fixed legacy raid scaling so people could do transmog runs it wouldn't be as bad
[4:59:39] 210Crawler: Good morning mates

[5:10:37] TMMOOF: I miss bfa lol
[5:10:42] Madnezz123: people saying bfa was worse than shadowlands are delusional

[5:11:20] Buckwink: bfa was way more fun at the point in the expansion
[5:11:21] strobinglight: at least we have TBC for a while

[5:11:51] FleuryGG: at least the RWF will provide some sense of excitement in 9.1, after that's over  however ...
[5:11:53] wtfbbqsauce: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight true
[5:11:56] geokouts: i liked leveling my alts in BFA rather than in SD

[5:32:56] cruzeal: no one gonna play that during tbc classic launch LUL
[5:32:56] StaineGm: If you see the advance in games in the last 20 years, it is very likely that another civilisation already developed a "game" that is indistinguishable from reality, and that we live in it.

[5:35:47] hulkomania: @fnbre because FRESH
[5:36:13] Bistavert: People would play up through naxx and then find another server starting over again
[5:36:20] mrblond5: fresh what everything is the same
[5:36:54] hulkomania: the most  exciting part of a new game or expansion is the first few weeks when everything is an upgrade
[5:37:12] KaisenSiru: Classic PepeLaugh
[5:37:16] Lawdito007: dead
[5:37:18] cruzeal: classic era servers are a ghost town atm

[5:37:36] tsuin__: they'll repopulate once classic releases start getting to unpopular expansions
[5:37:44] laddo543: ocianic is dead on classic area
[5:37:49] Ezekyler: people will have hard choice into WotLK or not, TBC was a natural step forward
[5:37:51] ArcaneSyntax: the problem with the way it's set up is that tbc is just flat out better than classic.

[5:38:12] Lawdito007: what dungeon is this?
[5:38:13] VenomSpawn: I thought they'd make classic vanilla seasonal or something like that
[5:38:16] mrblond5: didn't they wanted to do something with the oceanic servers few days ago ?
[5:38:18] Tycade: do you have any tips and tricks for new prot pallys? still learning but It's alot of fun!
[5:38:21] Mr_Cold_Ice_Tea: @Lawdito007 scholomance
[5:38:22] ditaern: They should treat fresh 'servers' as a Season (of 1-2 years) and then merge the chracters to the 'dead' servers when the next Season starts
[5:38:31] Collected1: GLORIA
[5:38:32] Baltickat: what is this dng ?
[5:38:35] NovaSun84: cool
[5:38:36] Lawdito007: @Mr_Cold_Ice_Tea ahhh ok ty sir
[5:38:37] Bistavert: eventually they will do a fresh classic -> BC -> WoTLK rotation
[5:38:43] CritcobainTV: They are not prepared KEKW
[5:38:43] FreeMont: TBC is "hard" like Vanilla classic but with better Content
[5:38:47] VenomSpawn: Illidan warned them, too
[5:38:53] Dreadfrost: TEY ARE NOT PREPARED
[5:38:55] NovaSun84: Once we get 1 month into classic, I figure a good 10-15% will go back to classic default

[5:39:21] NovaSun84: tbc is decent, but I'm already missing the oldschool talents

[6:29:10] Mallaes: @HilariousMax Kappa
[6:29:13] KaervekFC: @ShadoodHD You would think so, but trust me farming the rep how 'normal' people would do it is stupidly long, painful and frustrating.  This is actually the quick way of doing it.

[6:31:35] Collected1: dat min max life
[6:31:41] Timeless12: hit 7- then run heroic dung and done
[6:31:42] HilariousMax: He didn't calculate for Human +rep /rage
[6:31:45] TowersOverYou: shouldnt that be the goal to get rep?
[6:31:46] jasperboy: im gonna get revered with thrallmar fast, but everything else, heeeelll no
[6:31:46] D3m0nHunt3r666: you dont revered with every place
[6:31:48] ShadoodHD: that's like selling your left kidney kind of stuff right here monkaS
[6:31:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: need*
[6:31:50] Xindii: Just play TBC and it will all happen danJoy
[6:31:52] Sch1ey: also save turn ons till honored basically
[6:31:55] Talok85: playing according to the guide would sap ALL the fun out of playing for me
[6:31:55] VenomSpawn: You'll probably hit it without needing to count
[6:31:57] Garrujak: anyone who levels like this is going to be bored week 8 when they're waiting for the next phase with no rep or raiding to do
[6:32:00] Shrenko: just watch step by step while lvling
[6:32:01] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Check this baby out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOoW7kpa2uM
[6:32:14] Endy253: Forgot how much grinding was involved lol
[6:32:14] Loranis: there is no real reason to be revered that quick
[6:32:15] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: everything is linked under the video
[6:32:17] ShadoodHD: "convincing" if you want to be crazy enough to do it...
[6:32:20] juschllllng: I thought it was confusing too but i thought I'll worry about it when I face it
[6:32:29] Artivicii: Yeah. As a dungeon spammer, I’m glad he narrowed down the quest search for me
[6:32:30] dracullus: b-but 10 rep
[6:32:32] Nico_vdM: dont forget ogri'lazy LUL
[6:32:32] Sholmes2: I didn’t find it that hard the first time around
[6:32:39] tehrobtar: yea those areas are gonna be slammed
[6:32:41] Kman3107: This is a video for people who's re-rolling or making an alt later. Not for first time main chars.
[6:32:42] t_apta_p: Ogril' faction FeelsBadMan
[6:32:47] HilariousMax: Warbead grinding was quintessential TBC. Middle of a PvP zone Hell on earth
[6:32:49] Sholmes2: No videos back then
[6:32:50] KaervekFC: Even back when BC was the current xpac it was known that if you wanted to level your Rep the quickest you farmed dungeons before doing quests.
[6:32:56] MrDonut211: pvp servers are gonna be f-ed
[6:32:59] VenomSpawn: Is that music just standard UC or leatrix?
[6:33:01] ShadoodHD: i mean i agree with the method and i can bet it's efficient... BUT... just BUT.... we all know people will also grind the hell out of rep items...
[6:33:04] kh0nan: why not turn in quests until honoured?
[6:33:07] peinen: those areas are going to be a gongshow
[6:33:07] FresheFefe: ho long does it takes to lvl from 40 to 60?
[6:33:09] CritcobainTV: But i need to be exalted with aldor at 70 so i can go hard as fuck with my weapon >:(
[6:33:12] Loranis: im so sad im on a pvp server
[6:33:13] Loranis: damn
[6:33:16] RadioAchievements: Hellfire is going to be a bloodbath
[6:33:26] Shrenko: @VenomSpawn Towelliee is using his own playlist
[6:33:29] ShadoodHD: it will be like old times 4Head
[6:33:35] Hazno: @kh0nan because the lower level normal dungeons stop giving reputation when you reach honored, so you save the quests until you reach honored to maximize reputation gain
[6:33:36] Yagr6: so did u just say we save our dungeon turn ins until revered?
[6:33:37] Bernardo994: Bernardo994 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! WOOT WOOT
[6:33:42] Artivicii: Hell in hellfire
[6:33:43] Fenixzzz: do you have the link for the video please
[6:33:48] KaervekFC: kh0nan because normal dungeons don't give any rep after honoured.  So that means you can't get above that until you hit lvl 70 and do Heroic farming.
[6:33:50] JustAwaay: just joined, anybody can link the video ?

[6:34:19] Hazno: sarJeras
[6:34:20] Endy253: Well its getting honored before quests so you dont lose out on that rep. Doesnt rep stop in instances at honored?
[6:34:21] Nico_vdM: seth heck
[6:34:21] Domi98_: think yours is right
[6:34:22] Hayquel: do quests give rep after honored?

[6:34:46] ShadyWizWolf: I say Shesh thick Halls @Towelliee
[6:34:50] egraves7: that's definitely a guy who spells rogue as rouge
[6:34:56] rosstherosstrich: How many dungeons to get honored?
[6:35:01] Hayquel: @Hazno is it just dungeon quests or every zone quest?
[6:35:01] Artivicii: @egraves7 LUL
[6:35:04] CptnJacky: :)
[6:35:08] CrowCommando: It is Seth-ikk
[6:35:13] mpmicke: MY goal is to lvl true questing reach 70 then grind (sence im solo player) its my only option
[6:35:18] NovaSun84: Its revered for Kara right?  Exalted is the icing on the cake?
[6:35:29] Hayquel: @hazno only caught the end of the video so my bad if it was mentioned

[6:36:05] KaervekFC: BC had some great dungeons though, so the grind while it's nasty is in nice environments.
[6:36:08] Hazno: @Hayquel all quests give reputation no matter what your reputation is, but killing mobs in normal lower level dungeons only give reputation until honored, so you farm the dungeons until honored, then do all the quests
[6:36:12] Blackplaguee: Just wrapping my mind around doing this again after 15 years ; ;
[6:36:18] mpmicke: @litofskas hope so :S
