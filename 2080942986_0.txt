[3:10:12] Djingozor: fs is 5
[3:10:49] novhakin: lmao
[3:11:00] Daire25: So every healer ever has been making the same miustake, we aint dispelling, IT ALL MAKES SENSE
[3:11:05] Djingozor: 10 dispels in 2min 40 sec fight xd

[3:11:21] Ginell88: ye 10 is super low
[3:11:39] Sofiiezz: omg its not like someone has died like chill
[3:11:45] Sofiiezz: HAHAH exactly
[3:12:06] Daire25: How many dispells should she have did Ginell? I am curious
[3:12:12] Daire25: since u know the number
[3:12:39] Collnaris: are people backseating again Susge
[3:12:46] Faeynna: Sometimes it's just more mana efficient as well to not dispel. :D If the person has cds up or noone else is taking damage.
[3:12:48] novhakin: thats a rough boss to heal... 10 is a decent number imo
[3:12:57] Badziee: @Daire25 you are not curious, you just want to put others down
[3:13:10] Sofiiezz: and also some ppl can dispel themselves
[3:13:14] Daire25: Put who down? He's the one saying shes doing a bad amount of dispells
[3:13:16] Daph__gg: @Ginell88 You don't undestand how this fight works then. You want people to sit the debuff if they have a defensive up, because you will end up having more dots out than you can dispell anyway.
[3:13:19] Daire25: it's a stupid comment
[3:13:25] TyrasDemon: also you cannot dispell every single debuff, you have to let few of them to run out
[3:13:45] chimmyshu: @Sofiiezz he could clearly dispell himself from this chat Kappa
[3:13:47] Daph__gg: You cannot dispell every single debuff anyway, if people have a defensive, they sit the dot. Period.
[3:13:54] Faeynna: If I'm on my DK, I don't want it displled.. because I can AMS it and get free Runic Power...
[3:13:56] TyrasDemon: julia played that correctly chat just beeing stupid
[3:13:59] Sofiiezz: @chimmyshu HAHAH PLS
[3:14:11] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[3:14:33] Daire25: Ofcourse she played it correctly, if u dispell every single debuff, then ur playing it wrong, the whole mechanic is to outheal the debuff and dispell the fresh 1
[3:14:35] Faeynna: And for ret paladin, another way to trigger damage shield, so free dps for Mixy. :D
[3:14:44] leucosiaqt: for someone who has not played retail in a long time, hows ret? they seem fun as hell right now
[3:15:10] Daph__gg: No problem Snow, I play healer myself and timed this on a 27 tyranical. This guy just has no clue how this boss works :D
[3:15:11] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[3:15:12] Daire25: How did this guy say she played the boss wrong, and then someone said to me I am tryna bring someone down? Wtf lol
[3:15:28] chimmyshu: legendary Prayge
[3:15:33] novhakin: cause they were a salty couple
[3:16:55] Faeynna: Såg din pizza på Twitter btw! Den var... intressant. xD Jag skulle nog inte valt det själv.. men ja. Kan ju funka! :D
[3:18:28] Daph__gg: @Daire25 No idea LUL the healer played the boss as it should be played. If you have defensive you sit the dot. LUL people are just weird.
[3:18:36] Daire25: Yup
[3:18:36] TyrasDemon: GG
[3:18:43] Faeynna: Nice one! :) GG
