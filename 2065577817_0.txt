[0:04:22] all_beef_franks: @jdotb hope you had a great date night yesterday, those things are important! :D
[0:04:40] Tharayel: Yeah they used the gateto come back

[0:15:56] eYAAxD: as we know, echo always surprice in the end when it comes to WIN
[0:16:11] sw0ngs: It's interesting how everyone was saying dorki is gonna beat echo again and get his second win (hahaha).... but after yesterday it doesn't look like an easy run to the finals
[0:16:13] eYAAxD: the changing or doing different strats in the end cuz not spoiling
[0:16:31] luxumbra69: combining dorki and drogoh is an insane cheat code tbh
[0:16:49] mz1465: what do you think of Mandatory and Perplexed?
[0:17:01] tehendesht: I think Echo was taking a easy first day... not showing any cards
[0:17:40] luxumbra69: @tehendesht max is adamant this is not the case. idk if i agree.
[0:17:57] sw0ngs: @tehendesht typically they dont hide anything. They dont like to practice two routes

[0:20:53] GarbageM4n: the devs should have the groups show up to do dungeons and then throw a completely new boss at them in an unfamiliar place, that would make me want to watch comps like this more
[0:21:15] pranders1: I don't take non healers takes on healers seriously, I've seen players with just so high rio not having a clue what a healer does
[0:22:39] Craftthu: Dawg's everbloom was nuts. Everbloom is just a nuts dungeon

[0:48:53] flawlesslykun: literaly zero fucks given KEKW
[0:49:15] Denidzz: what level are they doing?
[0:49:23] TCancelYO: 23 i think

[0:49:53] thepanoramiks: Breath
[0:49:55] zerossussy: echo doesn't show off, they just do what they do
[0:50:04] cheesey_oce: JB you dodged a bullet with this MDI
[0:50:53] Kaijago: do you have any opinion to the amount of affixes theyve removed being inline with keys just geting easier and easier ?
[0:51:17] zerossussy: jb the most based person in the planet no meme
[0:51:50] Rypick: What is the ideal haste area to stay below
[0:51:51] Gavells: based
[0:52:18] L0mashu: how fast do you think they could od a 15? like 4 pull overall? @jdotb
[0:52:20] cheesey_oce: respect JB for standing up against these bad takes from Max
[0:52:28] cheesey_oce: representing healers
[0:52:30] TCancelYO: Feels like there is no risk on a 23 with no healer tho
[0:52:31] gelth: anyone else feel like the scaling from 23-24-25 is kinda cray cray rn
[0:52:50] gelth: like 23 vs 25 is a really big difference
[0:52:58] xilyx2: pretty good point
[0:53:30] Gavells: jb is right
[0:53:35] babajoda: agree with jb
[0:53:55] xilyx2: eh i dunno... i think being on the edge is good, makes it interesting
[0:54:20] pranders1: I think 100% it would be much funner to see them doing a 26
[0:54:21] Piaggio: there was no risk in running no healer in that atal wtf is he smoking
[0:54:23] SAMBBA1: Do they have avoidance/leech gear on TR?
[0:54:30] Surarn: I for one thought the totem boss was a banger on 23
[0:54:34] poonie1: drag his healer hating ass
[0:54:46] xilyx2: @SAMBBA1 no not unless its native to the gear or from enchants
[0:54:56] SAMBBA1: Ty
[0:54:58] JayPuppa: youre taking away 20% of a group by having lower keys. its silly. its like playing a hockey game without a goalie, and saying "lets see if our possession is good enough" @jdotb
[0:55:13] sleepdprived: lol watching the casters react to max's comments
[0:55:20] nash25pl: issue is  if you would up the key level to challange Echo u will make other teams struggle even more KEKW
[0:55:30] bingo_roswell: Came over from Growl's stream to say JB is BASED
[0:55:43] pranders1: i 100% agree with mr. b
[0:56:03] bingo_roswell: max is saying its a good key level for a challenge, JB is saying it was clearly not challenging
[0:56:16] nash25pl: it was not challanging for Echo
[0:56:17] zerossussy: JB is BASED
[0:56:22] nash25pl: other teams still died
[0:56:25] snse: fuck azshara
[0:56:26] ogzauce: based af. tallk yo shit
[0:56:35] TCancelYO: another no heal :D
[0:56:36] Zlomkobijec: for example the option to soak the spiders on yazma by tank was kind of lame deff could be higher key considering it's tyranical
[0:56:41] koala_715: I think the team should have to compete in the same group, comp, gear that you qualify in.
[0:56:58] xilyx2: blizzard and 'for sure' has never been a good partnership
[0:57:35] Redivna: such a random question, but do they just get the portal to the dungeons on the tournament realm? or do they actually hearth and walk to the next dungeon?
[0:57:37] TCancelYO: wtf fawgs infront+
[0:57:39] ovoox: Visual bug, or did echo just skip the first ground effects on first boss?
[0:58:30] Snaaade: so last boss can be done without healer then i guess.
[0:58:34] Veree: this 4 dps meta is so bad
[0:58:44] L0mashu: they skipped
[0:58:47] thunderioum: "the team with the healer killed the boss faster " COPIUM
[0:59:00] Surarn: Another key without healer :/
[0:59:01] drockside: i honestly can't believe they're running a key level where running no healer is even an option.
[0:59:19] babajoda: look at the DPS... spam HEALING
[0:59:22] gelth: what lvl keys did season 1 mdi have
[0:59:52] zerossussy: xdd
[0:59:55] babajoda: KEKL
[0:59:56] zerossussy: echo did lust
[0:59:56] nash25pl: @jdotb can you make your self smaller so we can see the boss % on the left
[0:59:57] Redivna: LUL
[0:59:57] ogzauce: BARS
[0:59:58] Whitewolf1441: xD
[1:00:00] Terciob: LUL
[1:00:16] drockside: i mean fuck it let's continue down this road and run no tank ya know?
[1:00:16] shaevizla: LUL
[1:00:31] zerossussy: max master yapper
[1:01:01] Surarn: Really good point, the key needs to look/be challenging so we arent watching a +15
[1:01:13] nash25pl: @jdotb can you make your self smaller so we can see the boss % on the left 󠀀
[1:01:59] meepthemeep: can u make yourself bigger so i can see you better
[1:02:12] Whitewolf1441: can you fill the screen with face cam?
[1:02:33] nash25pl: damn you trolls KEKW love u all

[1:03:30] flawlesslykun: i swear to god shadow priest and aug evokers need to get slapped on the cheeks
[1:03:34] Surarn: Have we already started cooking on the tweet?
[1:03:39] JuicyDoctor: what cpu do you use for wow?
[1:03:45] flawlesslykun: either dog tier or best classes in the game. no middle ground
[1:03:55] greywolffa52: legendary not worth it, healers, not worth it, game is so F'd up
[1:03:56] Gavells: RDruid gigachad
[1:04:05] Gavells: Mark of the Wild diff
[1:04:30] Whitewolf1441: lmao

[1:05:01] Zircons: max healersplaining
[1:05:04] zephah: thats not how pi works is such a banger take, complexity limit gonna start pi'ing blood dk's since you don't prio the most dps
[1:05:05] flawlesslykun: god i'm trying not to talk about max but this dude....
[1:05:14] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:05:14] Mattyuh: 16k dps away from Gingi...
[1:05:21] L0mashu: i dont want to flame max but honestly there is a lot to flame
[1:05:34] pranders1: how does pi work then? dumbest take Ive heard
[1:05:57] Whitewolf1441: pulling trash into boss is madness
[1:07:47] Mattyuh: druid nerf inc
[1:07:55] Whitewolf1441: tell them how the team with the healers won :)
[1:07:56] Gavells: Let's go Dawgs!
[1:08:04] ogzauce: CAP
[1:08:05] flawlesslykun: ngl, i expected gingi to be blasting way more than he is. In atal it was also kinda meh damage
[1:08:09] toxicraid: having healer in group new meta Pog
[1:08:13] TCancelYO: is that just druid buff deff? look at dmg???
[1:08:14] flawlesslykun: they should've won this map too
[1:08:23] flawlesslykun: 4dps vs healer
[1:08:28] m0dify: sandless
[1:08:31] REGENAROCKET: Gonna start pulling trash onto bosses in 11s
[1:09:01] CyonDru: good afternoon
[1:09:29] Assmaster2k: Kungen could win this solo
[1:10:02] Gavells: Look at the healing!!
[1:10:05] Gavells: lol
[1:10:12] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[1:10:26] greywolffa52: 0 death vs 0 death and Max wants to try and say healer diff
[1:10:28] Redivna: LUL
[1:10:35] nash25pl: Echo also did less dps with 4 dps OMEGALUL
[1:10:47] ren0m: Who's winning
[1:10:57] shunsha: wait did echo do less dmg with 4 dps?
[1:11:12] Whitewolf1441: dude meeix background looks sick
[1:11:19] Jrbgarcia14: @shunsha MOTW + resto is good ST
[1:11:26] ardent_iwnl: God max is insufferable
[1:11:29] Surarn: @shunsha Dawgs pulled trash onto the bosses and it seems people watch details without thinking
[1:11:33] shunsha: alright time for me to gear my resto druid then
[1:11:37] Gavells: Everbloom nice time for another no-healer key..
[1:11:39] Redivna: EB time baybeee
[1:11:42] flawlesslykun: @nash25pl i'm not blaming gingi at all, especialy because zaelia is on ret paladin... but playing ignite build on a 22 is kinda questionable i think
[1:11:43] uzza85: uzza85 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:11:50] Surarn: Sure mark is good, but echo have retri aura which isnt as good but still something
[1:12:02] Whitewolf1441: @shunsha youre required to main resto druid to watch jb
[1:12:12] Redivna: ^
[1:12:36] Kemplore: Didnt Echo wreck EB at blizcon?
[1:12:42] Surarn: @flawlesslykun Do you want more aoe dmg or more st dmg?
[1:12:50] Sybot: hello WidestJigglin
[1:12:53] uzza85: I'm really excited about the 4 dps twitter threads
[1:13:38] scheriel: echo going down
[1:13:51] flawlesslykun: @Surarn that's exactly my point. shit dies so fast (even bosses) that might aswell just go flamestrike i think. I might be wrong on that but idk. even in atal i felt like gingi was doing way less dmg than he should be doing
[1:14:12] flawlesslykun: ignite build just sucks on low lvl keys
[1:14:30] Zoxe: I agree about MOTW, but I think the key only being a 22 makes a big diff. 22 AD is easy as hell.
[1:14:31] fremen14: prio dam is the workd
[1:14:31] Surarn: They pretty much always pull stuff on top of bosses
[1:14:41] ren0m: Is this the knockout stage
[1:14:42] Surarn: So Ignite build feels way better than flame strike
[1:14:44] Zoxe: if that's a 25 AD instead, they need motw/healer.
[1:14:46] tra_iceman: are we supposed to hear the others?
[1:14:47] Sizebot: keys just aren't high enough level for boomkin and feral is just feral
[1:14:48] ren0m: Or is there a double elim bracket
[1:15:10] bizzenwow: yeah u got muted
[1:15:18] bizzenwow: sadly
[1:15:28] Zoxe: @ren0m it's a double-elim bracket.
[1:15:29] fremen14: boomkin is a shitty spec when dungeons are 10 minutes long lol
[1:15:38] ren0m: @Zoxe thank you
[1:15:39] Piaggio: i think for an experiment they should ban healers from TGP and watch the teams suffer :)
[1:16:08] Schmaddox: TT times dont matter the tech dont work anymore they used
[1:16:32] Vipeholm: @flawlesslykun what would be the point of flamestrike? just have more useless shit die even faster and prio damage take a hit?
[1:16:51] Surarn: @Vipeholm I think gingi would be higher on details
[1:17:01] lordmechiee: lordmechiee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:17:14] Vipeholm: yea, gangi big numbber me big happy go flamestrike
[1:17:17] JevyJ: Honestly both teams are so stacked lol

[2:28:59] Schmaddox: you are wrong dorki won one time in the mean time
[2:30:18] chimeraxst: @jdotb ask Drogo about that nature virtue tech or what you mentioned about BRH with the druids that they weren't doing it

[2:35:23] Mattyuh: its passion with anger, not being upset
[2:35:40] ragepiez: @jesustakethewheels restodruid is close to his heart
[2:35:43] Funkytree: @jesustakethewheels passion
[2:35:46] Notfuton: passion
[2:36:04] MrPentastic: Unless it involves preservation evoker, than it is anger again
[2:36:04] sw0ngs: 4dps losing to 3 dps, and they brought a leggo......still lost
[2:36:12] zephah: if people were 5 tanking mdi keys dps players would be freaking out, healers are just used to eating shit in the game
[2:36:12] sw0ngs: how bad is that leggo
[2:36:30] MightyGIGACHAD: jb boutta boost drogohs hps and dps
[2:36:36] clickermekk: if there is an mdi or TGP during (fated) season are you going to form a super group
[2:36:49] flawlesslykun: @jdotb a part of me was expecting to see at least 1 dungeon with STACKED legendary users. For that not to happen, just goes to show how some classes are just hardlocked for MDI regardless of nerfs KEKW
[2:37:26] TBouse: if i'm last hope i am not feeling great even though they won. legendary could have won by like 1+ minutes in both keys

[2:42:30] twinkieruler95: dratnos always smiles when he talks
[2:42:53] hunterzx: Dr. Atnos practices smiling in his sleep
[2:43:16] Funkytree: becoming nonverbal
[2:43:23] twinkieruler95: @jdotb who is next
[2:43:50] Webchika: Wait so if the observers turn it into a raid group I wonder if that messes with Pres / Aug spells, chain heal, wild growth, etc that are smart group based aoes
[2:44:12] hunterzx: probably not because most of mistweaver toolkit is smart healing
[2:44:27] hunterzx: we'd have seen some screeching
[2:44:29] tvilk: don't Evoker Ebon Might buff nearest allies? How does that work with the Observer? Same with the buff you give to allies when mages combust?
[2:44:31] Jnxz: happy to see rdruids in mdi agaiin  : )
[2:44:40] TBouse: no deaths and behind by almost 2 bosses is impressive
[2:45:05] Webchika: @tvilk I think you can target it if you cast it with a friendly targeted... but I'm not 100% on that since I"m just learning aug
[2:45:26] hunterzx: @tvilk not how it works
[2:45:45] tvilk: @tvilk Ebon Might is cast on your target +nearby allies
[2:45:53] tvilk: So observer fucks that up dont it?
[2:46:07] hunterzx: its not on your target
[2:46:15] hunterzx: it goes on allies with prescience, then proximity
[2:46:36] tvilk: eitherway if observer can be targeted by stuff, surely it can fuck with ebon might
[2:46:37] Mattyuh: need that redundant internet connection. cheap firewall with a fail over that kicks in right away
[2:46:55] Iamready50: Who do you think takes it all in the end?
[2:47:03] sw0ngs: well obviously its not a problem since they been doing mdi this way for years lol
[2:47:06] hunterzx: but with the amount of mistweavers and augs here, if ANY of these things targetted observers you'd see some serious screeching
[2:47:21] Iamready50: yeah, exactly...
[2:47:23] TBouse: Legendary still looked pretty good tbh, they were crushing Last Hope
[2:48:55] Jnxz: is that Seraphinexd top world r-druid on one of these MDI teams?

[2:51:12] Webchika: It might be kinda fun to see a tournament where the group comps are randomly assigned... Would be interesting to see routes / strats that come about when everything isn't predetermined / practiced

[2:53:25] bo3rni: weird haha
[2:53:34] twinkieruler95: maybe a lil bit more dps
[2:54:14] melko_: How many times have JB mentioned Legion today?
[2:54:17] hunterzx: dps profile for a spec don't mean shit if your players are doing 20% worse on it
[2:55:00] flawlesslykun: i want legion classic
[2:55:35] sw0ngs: I guess hes using that weapon for the proc?
[2:56:02] bo3rni: its gotta be the proc
[2:56:14] macildevil: are there any rdruid mains in mdi?

[3:08:36] trench_toaster: i have the 34 inch QD OLED alienware, the 240hz 4k OLED and a 1440p asus OLED i am selling (replaced by the 4k one recently)
[3:08:48] trench_toaster: alienware is way better than the asus in my opinion

[3:15:08] varyso: kangaroo burger?

[3:15:29] zebracak35: @Webchika I mean when they give you a tiny budget theres not a lot you can do
[3:15:39] Webchika: ... I worked in Hospitality for from 2006-2020 and the more stories I hear from MDI Teams, RWF teams, etc the more upset I get on your guys behalf that someone in the Hospitality industry took advantage
[3:17:04] Webchika: @zebracak35 Yes and no... some of the stories I've heard people in the hospitality industry took advantage of people less knowledgeable of the industry.... And sometimes with the number of Rooms & Nights involved with stuff like this you can get better hotels for less money than budget hotels

[3:30:06] Webchika: @branphd I loved tanking it on Venge DH lol... didn't always love healing it on resto shaman though
[3:30:55] Webchika: Fun question lol... if they had brought back Maw do you think we'd be seeing it completed in 2 pulls for MDI? (pulling to each boss)
[3:31:39] Webchika: wait 3 pulls sorry, not 2
[3:33:15] Shifter2k: Max has the ability to make his opinion sound like facts xD
[3:33:42] dsune_: @cheesey_oce real
[3:34:08] zebracak35: As someone who is in tune with the lore fandom of wow, they would fucking riot
[3:34:31] Guffels: no way. ff14 trash is the best trash. it doesnt exist
[3:34:37] Ghost5392: I'd hate it if there was no trash
[3:35:23] Ghost5392: what I don't like is when there is TOO MUCH trash or trash that is really obnoxious to deal with
[3:35:38] Guffels: idk having to kill trash once a week seems meaningless. if people like trash make it respawn on boss reset lol
[3:35:53] altenmuller: no trash = no boes = no free gold Smadge
[3:36:22] Wiigglles: no trash all the way im here to progress bosses, trash is just time waste/boe hopers
[3:36:29] Guffels: i have never seen a boe lol
[3:36:33] Harthad: ask him about text fringing
[3:36:46] MullbertXD: As someone who casts from their spellbook, I hate the change to the spellbook ui. It's going to block so much of my screen during combat, the icons are smaller, and all the muscle memory of what's on each page will be a huge adjustment.
[3:36:50] junglist_Soldier: boss after boss after boss would be too intense on progress , you need some gaps
[3:37:20] Wiigglles: i dont see the point of having a super zoomed out camera when theres always a damn tree in the way
[3:37:29] Guffels: idk trial where the body of the old boss gets in the way of the new bopss sounds fine lopl
[3:37:56] Wiigglles: trust me trash doesnt allow me to feel breathing space between bosses
[3:38:10] MieLULe: @jdotb i have Oddysey Neo G8 OLED, amazing monitor, my recomendations
[3:38:31] Wiigglles: if boss after boss feels too intense thats coz bosses are overtuned or ppl arent cut for raid boss progression style gameplay anyway
[3:38:49] junglist_Soldier: raids migth aswell be one room if its just bosses
[3:38:54] junglist_Soldier: just u vs endless bosses
[3:39:55] Wiigglles: give blizz less stuff to design maybe then important stuff will get worked on xD

[3:46:01] TBouse: having to run away from a boss doesnt sound interesting lol
[3:47:00] thasthebear: gambit was good with the woh skip  s4 it wasnt fun
[3:48:10] Guffels: encrypted goat seasonal
[3:48:10] pranders1: i think second boss fall has fun mechanics
[3:48:33] zebracak35: this is neck and neck, no?
[3:49:33] Webchika: I sorta want Thundering and maybe one of the other affixes that aren't in the pool now to be added to the affix pool
[3:50:03] TBouse: everyone hoping date night wins so we can move on lol
[3:50:07] Craftthu: Just my opinion, I think a dungeon made out of Timeless Isle for trash would be good.
[3:52:41] yesman297: u should've played this mdi
[3:52:45] zebracak35: I think they should do a dungeon that is soely archeology
[3:52:47] Guffels: some would say thats what the second half of dawn should have been
[3:52:50] zebracak35: first to mke 120 relics wins
[3:52:54] yesman297: you're the NA's last hope
[3:54:24] Webchika: I need opinions lol... If you're a Resto Shaman main trying to decide which other healer to play as an alt what would you guys think would be the easiest to accimate to? (I sort of play them all but not well atm lol)
[3:54:37] Guffels: what dps would you play in MDI?
[3:54:41] skFriberg: Sadge No JB when druid is S tier
[3:54:42] zerossussy: im enjoying watching this mdi compared to the older ones
[3:54:53] Guffels: ya

[3:55:11] tsumai: Weren't you toying the idea of playing Aug before it came out?
[3:55:16] Guffels: maybe boomkin for druid
[3:55:18] yesman297: RET
[3:55:19] fremen14: do you think key levels are too low rn?
[3:55:52] Webchika: I feel like with Aug you either get it or it breaks your brain for a while and then you get it or switch specs... (That's coming form someone who is currently learning Aug lol)
[3:56:00] FinestGoldy: what you believe the level should be
[3:56:09] TBouse: what if it was like yuumi in LoL LUL
[3:56:11] fremen14: @Webchika its the easiest spec in the game
[3:56:14] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:56:15] rayxxray1: aug with 3 dps, i think it is more damage than a 4th dps
[3:56:36] skFriberg: does he ever NOT look like he just woke up?
[3:56:50] Jacc_oce: Did you ever have to inspect your warlocks gear in mdi to make sure he was using 4set?
[3:56:51] TBouse: i hope tettles didnt style his hair and decide it looked good lol
[3:57:01] zebracak35: Tettles always looks like he just hit a line of dehydrated orange fanta flavoring
[3:57:01] gelth: @재치있는 it is definitely not easier than BM hunter
[3:57:14] Webchika: @재치있는 Lol I've been enjoying it but it took some explaining from someone who'd been playing it longer for me to pull it together enough to not feel like I completely suck
[3:57:20] Jacc_oce: He fucked his gear set LMAO
[3:58:04] Jacc_oce: Did a day of practice in SL with no conduits
[3:58:08] gelth: one time I forgot I sent my gloves off for crafting. and did a 20 Nok sans gloves

[4:04:46] Lara_TV_: I mean that's why there's several difficulties tho. Not requiring the whole raid to play well on a mythic endboss is just meh
[4:05:46] FinestGoldy: thats a rough wipe
[4:05:49] Wiigglles: that or bring back 10m so u have a higher chance or ensuring all players are on a similar skill lvl

[4:07:38] Harthad: yes
[4:08:29] Tailofps: yes
[4:08:52] Harthad: it can be 'fixed' by any boss damage design, like a pulsing fire aoe, which would require constant healing throughput
[4:09:36] TBouse: isn't everything being assigned a product of people over preparing as opposed to being related to the fight itself
[4:11:05] ragepiez: @TBouse nah you'll end up with gaps if you aren't managing heal cooldowns
[4:12:02] TBouse: @ragepiez that doesn't really address what i said
[4:12:13] Tailofps: for amirdrassil fights if you dont have a cd up for boss mechs you usually die
[4:12:32] Tailofps: idk how you would yolo like mythic tindral without assigning cds

[4:12:43] pranders1: spinning in the gauntlet 100%
[4:13:44] Tailofps: last boss is a joke compared to 3rd
[4:13:50] ragepiez: @TBouse i guess i mean that if you dont coordinate and assign and people punch their cd out of rotation because they're trying to help there will be a gap where a cooldown is needed for a mech but there's nothing up
[4:14:16] grieze: it's a coordination boss, no shit max wouldn't ever run into that issue
[4:15:23] SinstoneRelics: ppl take it to the walls not knowing the mech, turns into a disaster
[4:16:33] gelth: just one person misses that they have the clear until they don't have time to full clear. that's all it takes
[4:17:37] Webchika: I couldn't even get Pug healers to get into Discord for Heroic Fyrakk last night... but I also don't do higher keys outside of a guild group (Higher for me is like 20+)
