Today he started stream with 3 golds in his bags, 4x 10slot bags, executioner sword ( 1g+ from vendor) and a different spec which is another 1 gold + he grind some xp offstream, but theres no way he coulda farm that much gold in such a short amount of time... he didnt admit cheating untill he gave in LOL he literally fucked with the addon and deleted the vod Xaryu

[7:32:55] 39billy: xpp
[7:33:00] hendricus_wow: they should just make the ranks require a set amount of honor, but make it a lot so people have to progress for a long time, but also no rush cause of player competition
[7:33:02] BR1NGTHERAIN: HmmOK

[7:33:35] LiquidFinal: dev issue tbh?
[7:33:36] My_keI: dont add bgs
[7:33:36] RaxtonTV: come up with a not retarded honor system

[7:33:53] mercurystaken: imagine a osrs version of wow i could so get behind that
[7:33:54] Sharkrad_5: add arena to vanilla
[7:33:55] Eriandel: just make the boss giga hard and the quests and shit in AV could weaken them
[7:33:56] ghostbagster: pvp is os bis wish wish we can do it more
[7:33:57] phatnuggztv: They should just put a cap on bg spam so people have to go World pvp to fill in the dead space
[7:33:58] Smoogol: it's just like retail... people hate to play it, rush to rewards
[7:33:58] 39billy: wsg FeelsWeakMan
[7:34:00] MrPink604: world pvp made the game unplayable for anyone not max
[7:34:01] 360noscopefeet69: I liked AV cuz I could watch netflix

[7:36:14] qbabattoir: 2 warrs v 2 mages PepeLaugh
[7:36:15] Cryptic252: solo shuffle retail has spec based leaderboards - that would be similar
[7:36:15] Whoneedspace: being compared to your own class is a smart idea
[7:36:16] My_keI: its like parsing
[7:36:17] KingEmil_of_Norway: LETHIMCOOK
[7:36:18] imRekaal: payoGa
[7:36:19] stamets: I think that 10 v 10 warsong gulch should be the meta but rated battleground style instead of the honor system
[7:36:19] lastryk: LETHIMCOOK
[7:36:21] panacer: you try solo shuffle on retail at all? its spec specific rating
[7:36:22] LiquidFinal: which is actually hella likely
[7:36:22] Naomylel: so like solo shuffle?
[7:36:24] SpeedOMike: LETHIMCOOK
[7:36:25] nice_feed: @nice_feed I know, its gonna be in the HC server too. We dont know what Bliz plans to do with HC PvP

[7:36:32] smgski3: highest rated shamans POGGERS
[7:36:36] LoveToPlay123: thats how soloq works in live
[7:36:37] crazymage321: In Old DND there was a built in hierarchy system for Druids and Monks, so there would only be one Grandmaster of Flowers Monk for example, having that type of ranking would be cool.
[7:36:38] sygyzy07: !level

[7:37:06] magic_mac: in retail spec makes sense
[7:37:08] Yurumates_: Spec makes sense, each spec is very different
[7:37:08] gayforcandy: id say just make it give a cool looking mount and not have any arena gear

[7:39:34] nice_feed: dual spec in vanilla would be extremely based
[7:39:35] marz777: pali and shamans for both factions?
[7:39:37] p_fet: hes saying no one would queue with shit classes
[7:39:39] SpeedOMike: slippery slope
[7:39:39] kpt58: you‚Äôd probably have people hunting for the weakest class tho, that would be cool
[7:39:39] Whoneedspace: if rogue is good and spams the entire bg system then people will balance it out by going like full tank to just counter them
[7:39:42] Fawley: it basically never goes down
[7:39:44] Lnation: @Lightxwater its nuance
[7:39:44] Laaash: Either dual spec, or make max cost like 5g to respec
[7:39:47] Mahca_: they should reduce decay time

[7:40:02] burntbbq: dual sepc would need a cool down or it would be abused in raiding
[7:40:02] qbabattoir: duel spec but ur second spec can only be used in arena
[7:40:06] extra_dizzy: Solo shuffle vs normal arena first ?
[7:40:06] LiquidFinal: not a wow thing
[7:40:07] vailecule2: dunking on pve specced people is fun
[7:40:08] Fyslol: with arena in the game not having dual spec feels bad
[7:40:09] CasualTryhrd: weekly reset would be aight
[7:40:09] grongamigna: people hunting for designated "weak" classes would merely set up the metagame to use "weak" classes as baits 4Head
[7:40:10] stamets: I feel like paying to respec should get cheaper permanently after 50g
[7:40:12] gayforcandy: just cap it to 25 gold instead

[7:48:37] Yurumates_: dwarves are IMMUNE to poison thanks to Stoneform
[7:48:40] Eriandel: There's a lot of different versions of classic they could make, and private servers have already laid the ground work. Like that one where you built a class from all the spells and dropped your shit when you died.
[7:48:41] shambles9v: novelty is what makes things fun
[7:48:43] min_maxwell: It was also take forever for people to level new tunes to take advantage of trends

[7:48:53] ChillyHTX: flare from hunter without shadow step from a rogue is rogue too

[7:48:56] skerrzo: ele/rogue stun lock while the ele blows everything up
[7:48:56] sircrumpler: warlock would get shit on til t3 gear

[7:49:20] stamets: same wavelength
[7:49:21] dressmachine: PeepoWeird

[7:50:17] ind_i_go: lmao
[7:50:18] gilbert0friv1a: xdd not in my paygrade
[7:50:18] Eriandel: I'd prefer if they kept all profession stuff in arena but just added some new stuff for other professions. Could be fun to see new shit.
[7:50:19] gayforcandy: its nice to pretend

[7:51:01] Vio9: yup, OSRS shoulda been the model to begin with
[7:51:01] Chishikaru: polls.... that wouldn't get meme'd xdd
[7:51:01] Coopmore: need 70% to pass and its good
[7:51:02] TheRealUnnamed: @sodapoppin if blizzard vwould offer you the job to do it would you take it?
[7:51:02] Happy_Forest: let the community run the game 5Head
[7:51:03] RaxtonTV: osrs polling actually sucks severely in certain scenarios
[7:51:04] Talrios12: you think average players wont ruin the game immediately lol?
[7:51:04] Udovar575: In order to change anything in this game, they need approval from 12 different chains of command. That is why everything takes 6 months to implement. ICANT
[7:51:05] miseri20: Do like Runescape?
[7:51:05] marshmallowfelo: if they don't have a dedicated team they wont put in the work to do changes unfortunatley

[7:51:09] sqwippysquishy: apply to be able to partake in polls? to weed out ppl who dont care
[7:51:12] JJJnray1: alot of polls on rs that are good get mass down voted by certain communities because they dont get updates @sodapoppin
[7:51:13] TheGreatWoobles: Osrs polls suck after awhile
[7:51:16] Riingo: polls get people to talk about the game too
[7:51:16] Hoshma46: Unfortunately it's Bobby's world so they wont
[7:51:20] someUFOs: I think they should limit PVP to frost mages only
[7:51:21] JulioTheCourageos: Everyone hates on blizzard but they love playing their game, such hypocrites
[7:51:24] New_Game_Plus_o7: osrs was big because jagex fucked shit up and then a few devs that actually cared picked it up. that's what needs to happen.
[7:51:25] Happy_Forest: why would he work when he can stream all day OMEGALUL
[7:51:26] Gokusamaiso: why are you guys talking about osrs?
[7:51:28] unpeacegamin: let mitchy j do it
[7:51:30] Whoneedspace: if classic hardcore official has custom challenges like no equipment or the ironman stuff id have way more confidence they could do like a classic plus with arenas
[7:51:30] crazymage321: Thats why Dark and Darker was a breath of fresh air, no cooperate pipelines mugging up any changes

[7:51:41] gayforcandy: Clueless i'd love to work with blizz id make such a difference
[7:51:42] Tencelic: @JulioTheCourageos we like the game old blizzard made. not the direction current/new blizz has gone
[7:51:43] kpt58: im still betting we‚Äôre just getting classic cata, mop, wod, etc and nothing at all new
[7:51:44] Blueman7: @JulioTheCourageos This game was created 20 years ago.
