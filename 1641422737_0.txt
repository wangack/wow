[2:34:19] rynoh_2: what is max level?
[2:34:28] mattimanone: No man's sky has improved in way more ways than New World. New World is just flawed from the core

[2:36:41] 7h3_Pr0v010n3: Why didn't anybody tell me those were the good times. FeelsBadMan
[2:36:46] Utmost777: it is because of the risk involved. it takes so much investment to make an MMO so why would they risk an unproven formula
[2:36:47] Vagitaria: My WoW account has a Dec 2003 creation
[2:37:02] mfMageFish: anyone play ultima online?

[2:46:32] swaee: it was the same on launch
[2:46:35] oldoakman: you hear anything about ashes of creation?
[2:47:00] VegaCP: GW2 is very fun but even as a someone who loves it, I wish the progression was different
[2:47:16] weremoose2: did you make it into one of the fresh servers?
[2:47:16] SVTSteve: I see a lot of guild wars players just doing competition shit
[2:47:18] grvywow: GW2 would be awesome if it did gear progression
[2:47:19] Croxssis: I think they changed that in new world, not sure how it looks yet though
[2:47:21] AOMAMS: its quicker to get a degree than max out in osrs lol
[2:47:33] SmokeBuddha: gear upgrades and character progression is like 80% of why I play mmos
[2:47:35] SVTSteve: completion*

[2:47:46] realGameTheory: Ashes Occasio-Cortez
[2:48:09] JPsquaredd: I feel that end game is kinda lacking what i will say is that it does well to involve the played base being random bosses/events
[2:48:12] realGameTheory: its still 2020
[2:48:14] Nomiek: Whatever happend to Pantheon? Isnt that supposed to be out soon?
[2:48:16] J1MMYTHESHARK: getin old

[2:49:57] grvywow: its either new, or I am getting old
[2:50:00] JPsquaredd: I mean all of asia is pretty conscious about masking up before when you're sick
[2:50:00] SepeIio: POG
[2:50:02] oldoakman: this is cool
[2:50:06] gachigasmirl: OMEGALUL
[2:50:10] JK100: That's a hell of a cannonball.
[2:50:22] JPsquaredd: But since japan government is still like "mask up slut" locals are always masked up
[2:50:22] SepeIio: nuclear cannonball
[2:50:26] gachigasmirl: I went to take a dump and got disconnected after 10 mins of AFK, guess not playing today KEKW
[2:50:29] VegaCP: I'm downloading this game rn, gonna try running musket
[2:50:35] zehuntar21: did they add more quests or is it still the same 5 quests?
[2:50:54] Wingsofjanitor: diversity is its strength

[2:53:45] VegaCP: Do you have any spare attribute points?
[2:53:56] LoRswat: Drops enabled on Twitch... nice
[2:54:16] JPsquaredd: @staysafetv lets say you get hired to design a mmo, money isnt an object and you have 100% creative freedom. What would you emphasize in your game
[2:54:20] Yubtini: lol the server is locked already. rip playing with the boys @StaysafeTV
[2:54:22] sighwarlock: i didnt come back for it but apparently the halloween event was cool, so i hope they continue that with other holidays and such
[2:54:23] Super__Bacon: Thats a big point that held me back from trying this out. Is it a good time to try it out now with all these changes?

[2:56:27] Super__Bacon: So what he's saying is- translate the .Hack, Black Summoner, Sword Art Online into a good game
[2:56:40] robthehammer760: A good MMO is all about the cat girls

[2:57:22] MurlisWoW: @svtsteve KEKW
[2:57:24] Jalapinot: NODDERS Players make the story

[3:02:42] robthehammer760: What time is boomy raid?

[3:03:01] Super__Bacon: Whoever legit believes you cannot see the difference between 24, 30, 60, and 120+ fps has never tried to see the difference.
[3:03:04] NateTheGreatish: Medea is the world, yeah? Says character creation is disabled. Sadge

[3:24:44] Kakurius: small streamers gets too good offfers not to do it
[3:24:46] VegaCP: you may lose some viewers, but overall the ads will account for that and then some
[3:25:17] olashma: Why does twitch not allow prime subs through the mobile app?

[3:28:44] Area51Labs: 12 months = 400% flying speed

[3:30:45] Vespyyr: It's true, I hear him talk about it on stream all the time
[3:30:50] Nomiek: Felt okay FeelsOkayMan
[3:30:52] Vicente_Prime: i've never seen you ingame in wow and that saddens me
[3:30:54] dave3ooo: doesn't shroud still play classic?
[3:30:56] grvywow: he will get his revenge one day.

[3:31:19] quill_tdtv: imaqtpie is based

[3:33:35] SwekAap: i just got my first void gauntlets POG
[3:33:45] IIINUCLEAR: I cant join any of the new servers KEKW
[3:33:49] slothlovechunk11: Riot MMO will be most hyped launch ever, hope I'm still alive then
[3:34:00] IIINUCLEAR: New servers, but only for some people
[3:34:05] Vagitaria: they're rolling out additional servers every hour or so
[3:34:19] VenomVeinZ: Kappa
[3:34:20] MeisterPetze: it will fail like new world :D
[3:34:24] IIINUCLEAR: I dont want to join new servers, I want to join the servers that have people playing on them
[3:34:24] Nomiek: Im already way too excited about it
[3:34:35] Nomiek: Cant wait for the full interview with Ghostcrawler this week
[3:34:44] Nomiek: Are we going to watch the whole thing on stream? PauseChamp
[3:34:48] JPsquaredd: Was it announced?
[3:35:10] Polerize: the mmo killer of wow will be bliz

[3:35:51] FeanorEUW: thats deep
[3:35:53] JPsquaredd: Yo yo @ludji
[3:36:00] Nomiek: @Ludji Yo FeelsOkayMan
[3:36:03] JPsquaredd: Last time i heard wow killer was wildstar
[3:36:05] quill_tdtv: you're trapped lol
[3:36:22] lammj3: Wild star was legit
[3:36:25] tampaESPORTS: ASHES OF CREATION PogU
[3:36:29] UndeadStarfish: club penguin 2 will kill wow
[3:36:31] Ludji: LUL
[3:36:33] MeisterPetze: bfa was totaly fine
[3:36:34] BroManFlex: swotr, age of conan, aion
[3:36:42] Mccdowwell: I dont like retail gameplay
[3:36:44] VekxGG: Wild Star was great
[3:36:46] AdamShwaginz: im huffing the hopium for DF
[3:36:46] Mccdowwell: its just random numbers
[3:36:54] antherpants: Hit level 60, Pick a covenent champion! Nah im okay.
[3:36:57] pandawan2: if Dragonfligh is bad RIP Retail WoW
[3:37:22] Degran: 2
[3:37:24] MeisterPetze: yes
[3:37:33] sickish: lol we still can't say the name of the xpac that came bfore BFA? that filtered?
[3:37:35] abruptdecayO_O: even if dragonflight is bad, theyve at least taken some steps in the right direction
[3:37:37] Ludji: LUL
[3:37:40] abruptdecayO_O: so maybe a light is coming
[3:37:45] Super__Bacon: The rumor of them changing SL story 6 months before beta is very interesting. Then the rumor that after 9.1 they pulled all dev to DF resulting in a lackluster patch cycle for SL
[3:37:48] xem0s: Dragonflight crafting has me interested
[3:37:51] Nomiek: @AdamShwaginz I hope its good, but im probably skipping out on launch for the first time ever Sadge just feel let down every time idk if i wanna do it again
[3:37:55] lammj3: They can’t break the good guys win story meta
[3:38:10] JPsquaredd: Wow can just pull a cod at this point? Same game every year but people lap it up
[3:38:14] sk4nkerveen: lol
[3:38:15] Ludji: Those Dracthyr look really really bad...
[3:38:16] slothlovechunk11: Everquest's old ass is still scooting along with new expansions
[3:38:17] Vicente_Prime: Have you tried Baldurs Gate 3?
[3:38:22] Vicente_Prime: tried/seen
[3:38:22] xem0s: People think they want to play pvp games like Ashes, but then they find out they dont :)
[3:38:29] Biobob666: dragonflight is the first wow xpack i dont plan on getting. ive tried to get back into it but i just cant for some reason.
[3:38:30] AdamShwaginz: @Nomiek ill let you know my thoughts then EZ
[3:38:36] sickish: dragonflight needed to go all out like the fel expansion before BFA. Doesn't seem there is nearly enough content
[3:38:42] Super__Bacon: The dragonflight story just -cannot- be bad. The continuation of retail rests on this expansion i'd wager
[3:38:49] Raivan994: ashes will be heavily demanding in terms of hardware
[3:38:53] Nomiek: @AdamShwaginz Yeah please do FeelsOkayMan
[3:39:01] draythe3: Did they give a release date for Riot MMO? Waiting for that and I am excited for D4
[3:39:16] Simmshady: DF will be terrible they're just continuing to go into the wrong direction with wow
[3:39:22] Ludji: I honestly think that Dracthyrs are worst thing that happened to wow
[3:39:23] Nille4mat: It's just gonna be the same daily/weekly routine, with in addtion M+ being dead on arrival with all the bad changes to it
[3:39:26] Nomiek: Riot MMO wont release until 2025 at the earliest
[3:39:30] R3ga1: there hasnt been any doomsday predictions about mechanics like previous expacs so thats a good change
[3:39:38] Super__Bacon: @draythe3 window of late 2023-mid 2024 is expected. nothing official yet i think
[3:39:41] R3ga1: we will see
[3:39:59] BroManFlex: titan KEKW
[3:40:06] Nomiek: Prayge dont get cancelled
[3:40:07] sickish: not with tencent behind it
[3:40:08] UndeadStarfish: teemo roleplay content Kreygasm
[3:40:11] ClinxyWow: cancling doesnt seem like riott
[3:40:12] Raivan994: i think DF went heavy on overhauls and content will suffer for it
[3:40:20] mxttyh: They released a video about the lore of the game and gave some insights about the map
[3:40:20] JPsquaredd: Pushed back
[3:40:25] JPsquaredd: Edged
[3:40:27] pandawan2: Why OG WoW players love Ghostcrwaler? Herd he is a legendary dude and dunno why
[3:40:28] JPsquaredd: Canceled
[3:40:29] mxttyh: I think that video came out about a month ago
[3:41:06] lukersz: and thats a StaySafeTV guarantee :)
[3:41:09] quill_tdtv: they've done a very good job building up the League universe
[3:41:10] VenomVeinZ: riot is going to make another weeb mmo
[3:41:11] Phalloides60: @MurlisWoW im in Pog
[3:41:16] PublisherNA: they did that with tft and valorant so might be same with an mmo
[3:41:17] Vagitaria: They wanna be the very best, like no one ever was...
[3:41:18] wldrs: I really hope it lives up to the hype
[3:41:19] PublisherNA: who know
[3:41:23] PublisherNA: s
[3:41:28] GarbageFailKing: They want you PI
[3:41:32] GarbageFailKing: Ccp
[3:41:35] Nille4mat: I hope it flops lol
[3:41:45] Ludji: Wow cartoonish art style is really legendary
[3:41:51] R3ga1: me too
[3:41:53] Biobob666: riot mmo going to b pay 2 win? they say anything yet?
[3:41:59] R3ga1: i hope it flops
[3:42:06] Vagitaria: I hope every game is good... why would you want something to fail?
[3:42:08] stokes_t: i agree the competition for blizz the better wow will be
[3:42:11] KaroMorgaz: Nice Voidgountlet StaySafe
[3:42:12] slothlovechunk11: I hope ur weener flops
[3:42:13] quill_tdtv: why do people want videogames to flop, like we're the ones that lose out in that case
[3:42:16] JPsquaredd: Riot only charges for cosmetics
[3:42:17] Nille4mat: tbh , it would be good if it succeeds cause it'll push the bar up for mmo's like wow, hopefully
[3:42:28] Kakurius: riot has established lore thats so good for mmo
[3:42:54] Raivan994: if new world and ashes don't flop with their anonymous lore riot's can't with their massive background
[3:42:59] mxttyh: What are you expectations of AOC?
[3:43:06] Zencent: bro i just bought new world  now i see ur on new world POGGERS
[3:43:07] theeasytitan: I had steak and ice cream for lunch
[3:43:10] Spanos_: they took to long on aoe loot
[3:43:15] stokes_t: these quests are all the same as original launch right
[3:43:29] Super__Bacon: never wish for competition to fail. competition makes your favorite game better, if they care to improve and retain
[3:43:30] Zencent: $20 easy snag to try it out
[3:43:31] Matped: @stevo252 legendary

[3:44:41] Nille4mat: AOC is what Tarkov is to shooters. Niche, but not bad by any means
[3:45:35] YaeroxTV: Tarkov is the best game ever. It's the only game which doesn't have any problems or bugs pokerFace
[3:45:43] Zencent: im excited to try this out , got a few friends to play it
