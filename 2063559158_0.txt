[0:30:31] SavedEight_ZGZ: 70$? what comes with it?

[0:30:36] tombalz: their struggling
[0:30:48] Topher_IRL: I don't know who I'm saying this to specifically, but I would like to issue an I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO
[0:30:53] DeadxGirlxGames: it's green which is so cool but I would and could never
[0:30:59] Topher_IRL: For all my complaints about the multiple monetization levels pre-beta
[0:31:05] Topher_IRL: And being told I was being dramatic lol
[0:31:18] Twoblackeyes_ZGZ: Looks like a mount and some currency
[0:31:28] aginsb: I would never buy it but its not actually that bad
[0:31:33] Twoblackeyes_ZGZ: absolutely shameless
[0:31:37] SavedEight_ZGZ: poe has a 500$ pack, but its justifiable, able to be chipped away via payments and comes with a shit load of MTX packs. youre getting like 5x MTX packs + the points value worth of money. i bet d4 gave you a horse skin and one axe skin for 90 lol
[0:31:42] aginsb: its $65 but it comes with 7k in platinum which would be around $70
[0:31:42] cajuncanuck: they overplayed their hand...very clear what's going on
[0:31:47] aginsb: so if you're buying plat it makes sense
[0:31:56] tombalz: "everyone who is still playing, please re-purchase the game"
[0:31:57] cmomoney2000: For 90 bucks you can buy a collectors edition of almost any game
[0:32:08] Twoblackeyes_ZGZ: Blizzard is doing an awful job of reading the community
[0:32:10] aginsb: Sure, and the plat would also be more
[0:32:23] aginsb: my point is that the cosmetic isn't that expensive, its something you get for free if you're already buying plat
[0:32:25] SavedEight_ZGZ: scroll all the way down to bottom https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase
[0:32:26] aginsb: no, I would never buy plat
[0:32:33] Topher_IRL: I think they should have a game that people wanna fuckin play
[0:32:34] aginsb: but if you are going to buy plat, its not a bad dealk
[0:32:34] DeadxGirlxGames: I got the 100 dollar one and it only came with a mount and a season pass that I did not use
[0:32:48] Topher_IRL: They blew all this money on Megan Fox marketing
[0:32:49] DeadxGirlxGames: like the game was 100 instead of 70
[0:32:52] Topher_IRL: And the game is dirty asshole
[0:33:15] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL even thats giving them to much
[0:33:49] Topher_IRL: @SavedEight_ZGZ You're right, a dirty asshole usually gets cleaned up pretty quick
[0:33:59] DeadxGirlxGames: at this point I run around aimlessly with my original druid when I am just not feeling any other game
[0:34:04] cmomoney2000: I got a shorter day today but don't really have a farm toon outside pally
[0:34:16] DeadxGirlxGames: but I am still only just hitting level 70
[0:34:16] aginsb: I put shop screenshots in discord to compare plat only purchase prices vs the mount

[0:38:39] Topher_IRL: Which to be fair the campaign was great
[0:39:08] Topher_IRL: But I'd be willing to bet very few people buy a Diablo game to play the campaign once and then put it down
[0:39:52] SavedEight_ZGZ: while the campaign was great, it was also like 7 1/2 hours
[0:40:06] Topher_IRL: Idk this shit always ruffles feathers but I'm never gonna not berate gaming as an industry until I see reason not to do so from these AAA studios

[0:42:36] Spyke_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL Gaming is dead to me. Hence why I'm playing a fucking CARD GAME.
[0:42:46] SavedEight_ZGZ: i paid 100$ for D4 and dont care to ever go back. I've spent 500++++++++ on a FREE game (POE) and even though i dont play it (waiting for poe2) i would probably still buy another MTX pack lmao
[0:43:17] Spyke_ZGZ: @SavedEight_ZGZ The problem is you're expecting PoE level MTXs from a dev team that can't even code inventories properly.
[0:43:47] Spyke_ZGZ: The campaign is the only redeeming part.
[0:44:04] Spyke_ZGZ: CoD having 2 hour campaigns for the past 5 years
[0:44:05] SavedEight_ZGZ: i would rather buy another 50$ mtx pack from poe and NOT touch the game than go back and re-experience d4

[0:54:09] Spyke_ZGZ: It hasn't fully sunk in yet, idk. Kinda just drained from the month-long process of "Do I have it or not?"

[0:54:31] StreamElements: We're LIVE on Kick! ---> https://kick.com/zeegers/
[0:54:38] cmomoney2000: Can't wait to finish healer so I can aoe
[0:54:50] DrunkenHorror: i agree with the sentiment but GDKP was like the #1 way to wash bought gold... its like attacking ways to launter  money,  the real issue is people  doing illegal shit  but if they remove the way to "wash" it its easier to track large gold transactions that are illagitimate
[0:55:03] cmomoney2000: Group but I'm gonna watch your solo video and give it a go after I finish priest
[0:55:08] chaos_zgz: dude i ran through cyberpunk and the dlc, that was an amazing game to play on the new pc and then i picked up helldivers on a whim and its a blast
[0:55:28] cmomoney2000: 2.5 levels to 40 on priest
[0:55:41] Spyke_ZGZ: While I don't think banning GDKPs was the "smartest" play... you can't deny that gold prices PLUMMETED the moment it was announced.
[0:55:49] Thor_Q: yooo
[0:55:53] Topher_IRL: It was the most reliable way though I imagine
[0:56:00] Topher_IRL: Like, attack the root cause
[0:56:06] Spyke_ZGZ: It's the easy one to police, right?
[0:56:15] Spyke_ZGZ: Like, that's probably a HUGE reason as to ehy
[0:56:15] Thor_Q: took care of some errands, went smooth. time to enjoy the day
[0:56:58] chaos_zgz: it is truly a great game imo, and for so many reasons. its insanely fun to play, its easy and only needs as much investment as you want to give it timewise so its accessable to everyone, and the monetization is actually 1/10th that of other games that are similar
[0:57:09] DrunkenHorror: tbh i see stopping GDKP as a way to inconvenience gold buyers,  which de-incentivizes gold sellers which reduces botting

[1:15:36] Wombatt_ZGZ: I'm not a big time streamer that can afford all these kinds of cheese

[1:15:46] Wombatt_ZGZ: I have sliced swiss cheese.

[1:16:12] Wombatt_ZGZ: I have 6 kinds of mustard open in my fridge
[1:16:19] Wombatt_ZGZ: and more in the pantry unopened
[1:16:21] Spyke_ZGZ: Mustard is gross.

[1:16:44] Spyke_ZGZ: These 3 things can stop existing and I wouldn't give two fucks.
[1:16:48] Topher_IRL: You gonna tell me you like miracle whip too?
[1:16:52] Topher_IRL: You fuckin scumbag
[1:16:56] DrunkenHorror: the ... fumunda cheese?
[1:16:59] Spyke_ZGZ: I don't consider Miracle Whip a real product, no.
[1:17:19] Wombatt_ZGZ: Miracle Whip has its gg uses
[1:17:29] Spyke_ZGZ: I can explain a lot of this off with autistic hatred of vinegar.
[1:17:31] Wombatt_ZGZ: but generally mayo is the better choice
[1:17:35] SavedEight_ZGZ: i got Dijon, Spicy Dijon, Koops Dijon, Honey Mustard Dijon, Regular yellow mustard and some homemade mustard lol
[1:17:45] Spyke_ZGZ: My sister LIVED with Salt & Vinegar chips growing up and I cannot stand the smell.
[1:17:47] Spyke_ZGZ: The taste.
[1:17:48] Spyke_ZGZ: Anything.
[1:18:03] Topher_IRL: To be fair that's most of the reason why I don't fuck with Ranch
[1:18:11] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Spyke_ZGZ whats your alt? Hellmans?
[1:18:19] Spyke_ZGZ: @SavedEight_ZGZ I don't eat mayo.
[1:18:23] Topher_IRL: My nieces and nephews growing up would empty a whole bottle of Hidden Valley at like every other meal
[1:18:26] DrunkenHorror: @Zeegers send in 2black,  sacrifice him and get the kill ?
[1:18:54] Spyke_ZGZ: Ranch is similar. 1st Grade we HAD to get everything from the lunch menu. Had a teacher's aide who was an old bitch that said "OH YOU GOT IT YOU EAT IT"
[1:19:09] Spyke_ZGZ: Made me dip the broccoli in the ranch, and I fucking projectile vomited across the lunchroom.
[1:19:15] Spyke_ZGZ: I was never told to eat anything again.
[1:19:16] Topher_IRL: Fuck them lunch ladies in elementary school
[1:19:30] Topher_IRL: That was my first F bomb
[1:19:35] SavedEight_ZGZ: fair, but my point is most mayo says on bottles nowadays "ingredients derived from bioengineered source" im also not the biggest fan of mayo
[1:19:36] Topher_IRL: Tell me I can't share my chips
[1:19:56] Spyke_ZGZ: @SavedEight_ZGZ Duke's is the only answer. If someone makes me something with Duke's, I'll eat it.
[1:20:41] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL i ended up dating one of their daughters in HS.
[1:20:48] Spyke_ZGZ: But I even "upset" my dad like a year ago. He was in a pissy mood one day and made me a burger to apologize but put mayo/mustard on it and I didn't touch it.
[1:20:48] SavedEight_ZGZ: :evil laugh:

[1:28:44] Spyke_ZGZ: He attacked me, ran into a pack of mobs and feigned so they'd go on me
[1:28:49] Spyke_ZGZ: I tanked them until he came up and bubbled
[1:28:59] Spyke_ZGZ: So, I dropped aggro and killed him instead.
[1:29:10] ARobotVampire: I liked the idea of the software, just caused issues on my pc

[1:29:43] SavedEight_ZGZ: i have 30 or so items on my icue, no issues personally
[1:29:44] Spyke_ZGZ: The dongle for my headset is going out, and since iCUE has kernal access it was crashing the driver thus causing Windows to fuck up.
[1:29:53] Spyke_ZGZ: AURA Sync
[1:29:57] Spyke_ZGZ: The ASUS one
[1:30:00] Spyke_ZGZ: Which is also DOGSHIT
[1:30:08] SavedEight_ZGZ: icue isnt dog shit
[1:30:12] Topher_IRL: Isn't Armoury Crate a thing too
[1:30:13] SavedEight_ZGZ: asus sync is dog shit
[1:30:19] SavedEight_ZGZ: armory crate is also dog shit
[1:30:25] Spyke_ZGZ: iCUE isn't dogshit itself, but the level of access it needs is.
[1:30:38] Spyke_ZGZ: Obviously idk why it needs that level of access, but it's kinda not cool.
[1:31:32] Spyke_ZGZ: CS2 uses some sort of new sound engine that for some reason iCUE isn't properly loading for me, which is in turn causing Windows to crash.
[1:31:49] Spyke_ZGZ: That shouldn't be the case, but like every single software has kernal level now for some fucking reason.

[1:35:32] Spyke_ZGZ: You can tell some of the devs are old school ass CS players lmfao
[1:35:33] SavedEight_ZGZ: i watched maybe 20 mins of valorant before it released  when shroud was streaming that streamers weekend. just not my kinda game.

[1:38:35] Spyke_ZGZ: Especially the res.
[1:38:39] ARobotVampire: they reduced wall hp, upped the cost of half her abilities, made her ult take another orb, and cut self heal to 30 instead of 60

[2:53:56] Summy_211: so there was a back end fuck up on starfire.
[2:54:09] Summy_211: that’s why it felt like shit still
[2:54:10] Rmont: starfire was hitting like 10% below what it should

[2:55:00] drewbullx: still unsure if starfire is worth casting over chain wraths
[2:55:06] Summy_211: ^
[2:55:16] Rmont: it should be
[2:55:20] Rmont: if you look at top boomies right now
[2:55:47] Summy_211: @rmont yeah I rotated it in my casts and parsed a 99 last night
[2:55:53] YorathofBadamshire_ZGZ: Signed up for raid
[2:55:53] Rmont: very nice
[2:56:20] drewbullx: good to know summy
[2:56:55] drewbullx: I've been curious because of the crit% and nature dam% increases off the new runes
[2:57:00] Summy_211: @drewbullx but with grace and the starsurge synergy, double casting wrath with garauntres crit at like .5 seconds is wild
[2:57:20] Summy_211: guaranteed*
[2:57:20] drewbullx: yeah, I've been enjoying it!

[2:59:53] drewbullx: with the talents, ya?
[2:59:58] Summy_211: but I don’t see most druids doing that
[3:00:18] Spyke_ZGZ: That's because the average WoW player sucks
[3:00:27] Summy_211: that makes no sense, if it drops for 1 person it should have been for anyone eligible
[3:00:28] Summy_211: wtf
[3:00:47] drewbullx: @Summy_211 I'll have to ask about the proper rotation at some point zeegerThumbsup
[3:00:55] Topher_IRL: I never understood how the drops work in there
[3:00:57] stanly_mcmanly: the drops are performance based
[3:00:58] Summy_211: @drewbullx for sure bro
[3:01:03] Topher_IRL: First I thought your group had to have the tag, but there's more to it than that

[3:27:54] Tinit5190: D4 is just bad. They can't even release the season ladder yet
[3:27:55] Topher_IRL: How did the duping work? You open your inventory and it loads everyone else's stash tabs in the zone or some goofy shit?
[3:27:59] FaeyeLinn: That sounds like a bad racecon distribution algorithm.
[3:28:04] aginsb: trading is no longer disabled and the duped mats started disappearing. Some people claimed legit mats also disappeared but I doubt that
[3:28:12] Spyke_ZGZ: @Tinit5190 Imagine being unable to implement even a simple .json file.
[3:28:21] aginsb: the dupping had something to do with lagging the game on console but I dont know for sure the method
[3:28:29] Topher_IRL: lol of course console
[3:28:35] Topher_IRL: D3 on console was soooo easy to dupe
[3:28:41] Summy_211: fuck! replies on phone don’t work
[3:28:43] Topher_IRL: Also there were hacked items everywhere
[3:28:47] Topher_IRL: Like shit with 234587387458345% bonus XP
[3:29:04] Summy_211: @spyke_zgz to your comment “if something doesn’t exist it can’t suck”, I was going to respond “just like your girlfriend”
[3:29:19] Summy_211: stupid phone is limiting me
[3:29:28] Topher_IRL: Tanaris turtles? Clams for pearls, drops meat, some greys worth $$
[3:29:44] Summy_211: @topher_irl no no topher you heard him. nothing.
[3:29:46] Topher_IRL: Golden too I think
[3:30:16] Summy_211: zeegs needs a 3rd account that only sits at the AH
[3:30:43] Summy_211: lotus is at 7s a piece. I try
[3:31:01] Summy_211: thankfully I made 100s of gold on it before price tank
[3:31:11] Spyke_ZGZ: I'm sitting here trying to meme some shitty code to add a leaderboard to D4. And I'm like "They'd just pull the data from the character, like level and time played to max le- Oh my god I bet they didn't even fucking code that in."
[3:31:42] Summy_211: !slots all
[3:31:42] StreamElements: @Summy_211 you got zeegerBELL | zeegerBELL | zeegerBELL and won 8755 Points zeegerPog

[3:31:54] Summy_211: on a slots all
[3:31:58] Tinit5190: Yay, now more people will be disapointed with it
[3:32:02] Spyke_ZGZ: Like imagine there's no leaderboards because they didn't add a way in the code to tell how long a character was played to max level.
[3:32:07] Spyke_ZGZ: So they can't accurately rank them.
[3:32:13] aginsb: !slots 5%
[3:32:13] StreamElements: @aginsb you got zeegerJuice | zeegerJuice | zeegerBELL and lost your 3239 Points zeegerRIP
[3:32:19] aginsb: @Summy_211  seems to be working fine
[3:32:25] FaeyeLinn: WoW on gamepass? Kill me.
[3:32:35] drewbullx: dude if I can play D4 on the $1 gamepass promo I'm all about it EZ
[3:32:40] Tinit5190: 9% lol
[3:32:41] Topher_IRL: Early sales always gonna be inflated though
[3:32:48] Topher_IRL: Gotta get that shit first
[3:32:55] Topher_IRL: Ricky Bobby
[3:33:06] Spyke_ZGZ: @drewbullx So would likely thousands of others. Give it a year and Blizzard will be raving about player numbers in D4 and how hugely successful it finally became like they said it would.
[3:33:09] Topher_IRL: Yeah if you can herb from under the map
[3:33:33] aginsb: seems about the same as fg prices on D4 ladder
[3:33:37] drewbullx: @Spyke_ZGZ I dunno they almost made 1b off sales by now, right? so I'm sure they don't care very much LUL

[3:34:53] Topher_IRL: It's a weird spot because a lot of $$$ opens up after low-mid 40
[3:35:38] Davidjac: tbh hinterlands is the spot
[3:35:39] Twoblackeyes_ZGZ: mb went to go make food, mustve missed it
[3:35:40] Topher_IRL: Grey farming is still totally doable and it's more lucrative when prices aren't inflated
[3:36:02] Topher_IRL: So when a Wildvine is 18 Gold your grey drops are worth way less for time spent
[3:36:07] Topher_IRL: Hinterlands has trolls
[3:36:10] Davidjac: Farm wolfs + trolls. Wolf meat for food, wildvine, troll sweat is a gray that sells alot
[3:36:10] Topher_IRL: And herbs
[3:36:34] Davidjac: nah just by aerie peak
[3:36:46] Topher_IRL: Wolves, bears, vultures in general all have greys worth decent money
[3:37:06] Topher_IRL: And two of those three also drop DMF stuff
[3:37:18] Topher_IRL: Turtles too, especially if you can skin
[3:37:24] Topher_IRL: Lots of grey opportunities
[3:37:34] Davidjac: by aerie peak they are 40-41
[3:37:36] Topher_IRL: There's some 41-42 ish camps

[9:51:14] ChicknBasket: Ive like having the boots healing rune
[9:52:00] ChicknBasket: spell power obv really strong, but heal rune feels like a poor mans penance
[9:55:19] Lemanifiq: Healing feet rune is single target, cast time 2s. Cast applies buff on you and you can use heal instantly during this buff (15 sec). Heals around 900-1000
[9:55:37] Lemanifiq: Interesting rune i think
