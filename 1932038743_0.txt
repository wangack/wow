[2:07:04] Molvonos: Your bias is definitely showing through those rose-tinted glasses.

[2:07:25] Minje12: @Molvonos Only thing I can think of that felt really good is how good it felt to get certain upgrades, like early blue weapons.
[2:07:26] delavor1: classic andy braincells
[2:07:33] Sneekzx: Classic players are stuck in the early 2000's lol
[2:07:36] Tausgi: no tow....retail bad :)
[2:07:41] occtriple: At the end of the day, it’s beneficial for players of both classic and retail that both versions are popular
[2:07:41] blunt_malunt: FRIDAY baby ! Lets go :)
[2:07:42] FancyJTS: At this point they are different games and really shouldn't be compared to each other imo.
[2:07:42] tehrobtar: WATER AND LEMON LOLOLOL
[2:07:47] tehrobtar: towelliee please xD
[2:08:04] tehrobtar: it is delicious! and refreshing - but fuck that was funny rofl
[2:08:06] KaisenSiru: That's what makes the classic players pretty insufferable. So much bashing, for what? They have what they wanted. They can stay there.
[2:08:06] izabeL: bye bye
[2:08:09] sipsac: too much lemon can hurt your teeth, careful
[2:08:11] DunzoCD: bye candy
[2:08:18] QuigsTV: @Towelliee Idk ive personally haven't been too attached to classic bc i played it when it was current. Lately tho Ive been having a lot of fun leveling my rogue on wotlk./
[2:08:24] Squirrel_nutty: why you has to be mad?

[2:09:02] xxlubetichxx: i tried to play retail a couple days ago... chat is just being spammed by leveling services

[2:09:18] tehrobtar: jejejeje
[2:09:25] sipsac: i want my monks in classic !
[2:09:27] dimofodi: Bro you aren't allowed to enjoy two versions of the game for different reasons. HOW dare YOU
[2:09:29] KralYoshii: @Towelliee legion better or worse than df?
[2:09:32] RolexKT: Fake wow streamer, enjoying retail no1MAD
[2:09:38] Sylphy_TV: There is content for Classic and Retail, people still complain  LUL
[2:09:39] abracka_: retail gen chat in raid instances are something else
[2:09:39] Bayne77: apparently "decent conversation" = name calling
[2:09:44] dracullus: @xxlubetichxx dude it's separate channel you can ignore
[2:09:45] Rudric_Ice: @DunzoCD nah u got it twisted
[2:09:49] Necrothia: i never played wow classic so my first experience as classic is also hardcore :)
[2:09:50] smt387: Towelliee your awesome haters are going to hate
[2:09:51] tehrobtar: yea - i definitely have to be in the mood for classic... sometimes i just want that nostalgia and just run around enjoying myself
[2:09:57] Molvonos: I'm willing to bet when he comes back in 30, he's gonna rage and i'm gonna end up banning him.
[2:09:58] Sneekzx: The only problem with retail that vanilla has is the social aspect. If they brought that back the game could be different imo
[2:10:04] mavericks312: Retail gen chat helps prog nights sometimes lol
[2:10:20] Necrothia: @Molvonos i'll take that bet :)
[2:10:39] dimofodi: I tend to get anxiety tanking pugs at medium key levels (8-20) so playing HC is such a relief, only thing I need to do is not die. That's it.

[2:11:08] cipusanx: @Sneekzx the difference between those 2 in so many aspects is so huge, they are 2 different games almost
[2:11:09] KaisenSiru: Pretty much. Means to an end
[2:11:20] dimofodi: Shit most of the time it's random invites, something gets done, there's a tyfg, and then you're solo again.
[2:11:23] fcsgamer: The world is simply less "social" as it used to be
[2:11:38] Woider001: I feel like a lot of people play retail as a SP game with a green-text group chat. Which is great, honestly. You basically have 2 discord chats while playing

[2:11:52] Molvonos: The idea that 'Classic' is more social is a strawman. The social aspects have shifted, but they're still there.  I wasn't 'social' in Classic, I had my guild I was social and raided with, rando-plebs I met in the field, rarely, weren't social.
[2:11:53] artois: is hc wow the reason why wow tokens are so high? >_> I had like 250k set aside to resub at my leisure and they spiked to like 300k+
[2:11:58] Exodeo_: Same in retail too though, you rarely see any of the pugs you run content with again
[2:11:59] Rudric_Ice: @DunzoCD :tf:  🤏

[2:12:36] CrimznR6: Since you're a baseball fan. What are you thoughts on the odds of the Mariners clinching the wildcard?
[2:12:38] Molvonos: Ironforge was the hub of activity.

[2:13:07] Thoreya: they didnt add dungeon finder in wrath until now, turned out great.. cap LUL
[2:13:11] delavor1: its the same thing really, given both servers have enough population where you can just play with randoms. If you want to play with someone again you just add them to the list and then go "wanna do LBRS?" or "wanna do a +18?"
[2:13:33] mavericks312: How did that social aspect go for wrath classic without the dungeon finder
[2:13:52] Rudric_Ice: now theres so many mechanics for one boss u cant even count and u need 1000s of addons for that
[2:14:19] Molvonos: I know I absolutely LOVED spending hours trying to find someone to fill a group in the classic experience.  Only for the group to fall apart because someone's dial-up got disrupted by their mom calling them.
[2:14:25] Thoreya: ^ i mean just one, lil wigs lol
[2:14:51] mavericks312: @rudric_ice you only really need 1 addon on stop it
[2:15:02] abracka_: @Molvonos i once spent 6 hours in BRD back in the day

[2:15:49] Molvonos: @abracka_ Yea, I only did BRD for the Onyxia questline and never touched it again aside from the raid running through it to raid MC.
[2:15:52] Exodeo_: but but #no changes Kappa

[2:16:23] mavericks312: @rudric_ice wrong I only use dbm
[2:16:39] abracka_: @Molvonos place was a literal nightmare navigating from start to finish with no addons or idea where you were
[2:16:47] Maruika: gdkp is so nice i love it. great runs all the time
[2:16:54] Woider001: TBC was peak classic IMO
[2:17:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: i was an officer in a raiding guild in wrath classic, the pool of people available to recruit were some of the dumbest people i have ever played with
[2:17:04] bugcatcher19: is it true some classic devs get money from restedxp which incetivised them to not put dungeon finder in wrath classic
[2:17:12] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 u are not the only one who plays the game
[2:17:15] artois: the fresh realms were great before they died during the launch of wotlk launch. Everybody was running everything legitimately, pretty anti-gdkp. then the servers died
[2:17:21] abracka_: i'm getting toons geared up to run GDKPs in ICC just so i can transfer gold from wotlk to retail
[2:17:22] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Unless you're mythic raiding, you don't need WAs for anything.  I certainly don't aside from making things look pretty with Luxthos' WAs.

[2:19:53] dguap: witness me !!!
[2:19:56] Rudric_Ice: and PVP too u need WA's for everything nowadays if u wanna be ''good''
[2:20:01] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice C'mon man, he did not just say that. I'm not the person to try and convince of that nonsense.  I've done up to +20s without any 'necessary' WA's or a metric assload of addons.  I do love my convienence though.
[2:20:03] abracka_: @abracka_ it's one of those WAs that when you import it throws up like 5000 icons on your screen, i just tossed mine around the top-ish of the screen

[2:48:38] abracka_: earn points for doing activities, daily/weekly objectives refreshing when the time is met, you can use the currency earned for stuff specific to the wizard vault
[2:48:52] Rudric_Ice: it feels old thats one of main gripes with GW2
[2:48:59] Deadwardog: wait i thought you could rez if your in a doungeon
[2:49:17] CardinalTX: so wizard vault is like the trading post?

[2:49:24] OxFive: @Deadwardog lollllll no
[2:49:58] abracka_: nah, there are items you can buy on it like ascended armor/weapons, crafting items for making ascended items, cosmetic stuff, etc
[2:50:07] Rudric_Ice: its like Final Fantasy never played it cuz of shitty graphics
[2:50:24] Wrizzik: it's NCSoft. They'll make the graphical upgrade a microtransaction
[2:50:26] DickHardly: You can use ReShade to make any game look good

[2:51:34] Sollice: Final Fantasy 14 looks MUCH better in game than it does on streams
[2:52:39] Animalfitz: would be great to see some new engines on some older games like star wars/rift
[2:52:42] Sollice: Yeah it doesn't translate well to streams
[2:52:52] Quickwalrus: Slight reshade tweaks help with ff14 as well.

[2:53:21] Rudric_Ice: @Wrizzik ye i saw that i was really hoping for like FF16 graphics but ehhhh
[2:53:22] BlackSparrow558: FF14 has such big open empty spaces. WoWs world feels much more alive
[2:53:38] Xerotheory627: FF14 is the best MMO
[2:53:39] gnarkotic_: Shoutout to that rogue
[2:53:41] TheZofren: probably a corporate bootlicking take but I honestly don't mind the wow shop for this reason, because wow pumps a bunch of money into the game
[2:53:50] FluffehZ: @Rudric_Ice an mmo with FF16 towKek  can't be serious
[2:54:00] mavericks312: @Xerotheory627 ok bud calm down there
[2:54:00] Quickwalrus: FF14 knows what it is.
[2:54:17] Rudric_Ice: @FluffehZ why ?
[2:54:18] Spykex02: Ff14 and wow are both great just subscribe to whatever you feel like playing at the moment
[2:54:25] Xerotheory627: Yeah they know they're the best mmoi lol

[2:56:33] Molvonos: Or the fact that, for a while, you were forced into a 'small' window for playing because the game had an in-game border
[2:56:46] Quickwalrus: @Xerotheory627 Yea for me I think I just loved making the friends there. FF14 I play on and off solo.
[2:56:54] piratechris: Better in peace than in pieces LUL
[2:56:58] Molvonos: Or that the map/spellbook took up the entire map and to regenerate mana, you had to STARE AT YOUR FUCKING SPELLBOOK.
[2:57:17] FluffehZ: @Rudric_Ice Not many computers will be handle a mmo with that kind of graphic towKek  Just look at all the players and details thats needed to be loaded same time in large area's. you will have less then 30 fps even on high end computers

[2:57:25] Noshpan: Yup, it still has a sub
[2:57:27] Demineaux: i nolifed SWTOR from launch until the f2p patch. sith class stories were the goat
[2:57:33] Xerotheory627: @Quickwalrus I had to stop playing it unfortunately. I got promoted at my job and currently just don't have the time it deserves.
[2:57:36] Molvonos: @abracka_ You never lose that PTSD.  Everquest was such a wild game.
[2:57:45] jtobiaz: morning bois
[2:57:51] Quickwalrus: Their videos were great back in the day as well for 11.
[2:57:57] abracka_: @Molvonos i may lose my mind in old age, but i will never forget that nightmare
[2:58:01] dumpkinblumpkins: Love eq
[2:58:08] Quickwalrus: @Xerotheory627 For sure, def not casual friendly lol.
[2:58:10] Xerotheory627: @Quickwalrus I mainly did savage mode and extreme fights which you need a static and my schedule is just too random and always taken up too hard to commit.
[2:58:33] Sollice: Friends and Family
[2:58:40] Quickwalrus: @Xerotheory627 Gotcha, well things happen. Good thing you can always go back each expansion and try again.
[2:58:43] Noshpan: @Molvonos EverQuest was the reason why I didn't get into WoW in '04. It made me think that paying a monthly fee just to play a game was pointless. But I did understand why folks would invest so much time playing it.
[2:58:52] Rudric_Ice: @FluffehZ maybe but then u can look at new world it looks really good
[2:58:59] abracka_: it would be pretty cool to see the XIV team incorp FF11 into their launcher/sub

[2:59:34] Noshpan: @abracka_ Detaching 11 from Play Online would be so wonderful
[2:59:47] Quickwalrus: @Quickwalrus Oh nvm i misread
[2:59:47] Molvonos: @Noshpan As difficult a game as Everquest was, I don't regret it in the slightest.  Would I go back?  Nah, same reason I won't play classic, but I loved spending weeks no-lifeing camping a single mob, for a single, rare drop that could be stolen from you.
[2:59:48] FluffehZ: @Rudric_Ice new world looks good yes, but compare to ff16, that game still looks a lot better
[2:59:59] izabeL: tram ftw
[2:59:59] abracka_: @Noshpan that launcher is the reason i quite playing that KEKW
[3:00:04] abracka_: @abracka_ quit*

[3:00:49] Noshpan: I think I still have the box for EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark, unless I lost it in "the Move"
[3:00:57] abracka_: @Molvonos now i have to take my happy medication early, thanks KEKW
[3:01:01] CardinalTX: like old school everquest.  Had to find and figure out over time
[3:01:01] Molvonos: lolol
[3:01:10] Sollice: @Towelliee You see my fantasy points from McCaffrey and Kittles last night?
[3:01:20] Quickwalrus: I started mmo life playing ffxi on ps2. When I went to wow it was breath of fresh air LOL.
[3:01:45] Molvonos: That's pretty much it.
[3:01:52] nilachip: Guild Wars 1 was decent
[3:02:01] Noshpan: My EQ character was a Wood Elf Ranger. I don't even remember how many times I've accidentally fell off Kelethin. LUL
[3:02:02] Molvonos: Rats and Skeletons until level 30, when you upgrade to snakes that can kick you.
[3:02:03] polaropposite76: city of heroes got me started on mmo's
[3:02:11] CardinalTX: Everquest was great, in 1999 LUL
[3:02:13] Rudric_Ice: @FluffehZ true but i was hoping at least it would look close to ff16 graphics but the ff14 graphics upgrade is just more of a remaster
[3:02:22] polaropposite76: then wow ruined that for me eventually
[3:02:26] Quickwalrus: @polaropposite76 I wanted to play that so bad when it came out but my pc couldn't run it.
[3:02:34] Rudric_Ice: u can /join uber if u want summons and shit

[3:03:21] MrSapiotv: Hey do you think gw2 is better than retail WoW?
[3:03:23] billybaroo1: i had chubb and barkley as my rb. im done w/ ff this year lul
[3:03:26] Xerotheory627: Saquan is in one of the hardest divisions lol
[3:03:28] dimofodi: Can you pick up D'Andre Swift?
[3:03:34] Quickwalrus: I had J.K dobbins and have joey B... so yea 0-2 lol
[3:03:47] Sollice: I dropped Joe B for Dak this week
[3:03:53] Glynn11: he's fragile as hell
[3:03:58] mavericks312: who was your number 1 pick?
[3:04:04] Quickwalrus: Yea I may need to bench for geno LOL
[3:04:06] Sollice: He picked Mahomes
[3:04:11] polaropposite76: @Glynn11 i'm convinced if the bears had drafted Mahomes instead of trubisky the bears would have ruined mahomes and trubisky would have won a super bowl
[3:04:15] Theduskflyer: Lol towelliee, dont worry. Yeah one I drafted a guy with a broken leg.
[3:04:15] FluffehZ: @Rudric_Ice Jump maybe 20 years and they might looks like that rooThink Yes but the remaster of the grahpics might get you interested, just wait and see. They are probably going to show more on the next two Fanfest or just wait until Tow play it again
[3:04:18] cpawannabegamer: Had a guy this year draft, kupp, kelce, JT and kamara. Dude had a full bench of injury or out players for week 1

[3:14:29] Noshpan: You can buy Red Lobster's cheddar biscuit mix, but it's intentionally made so it doesn't taste the same as their actual cheddar biscuits. So there's a guy on TikTok/Insta who knows the recipe.
[3:14:31] mavericks312: @Rudric_Ice firehouse hoagies are legit
[3:14:57] abracka_: @Sollice understandable, i'm from PA and i refuse to go to any seafood places. when we go on vacation, that's when i get my fill

[3:34:00] Broomba: what leather gear are you wearing @towelliee ?
[3:34:11] Rudric_Ice: i think bfa was better than DF

[3:34:16] crimsonbennie: yea you right
[3:34:23] dimofodi: had to grind covenants then the fucking nodes, then upgrade the nodes etc
[3:34:24] justagamingfiend: and doing the same starting area a milli0n times
[3:34:35] mavericks312: bfa wasnt better for casuals though
[3:34:39] Sicknessqt: Nothing to do in DF after i complete season rewards
[3:34:50] snake_like: some want giga grinds, no player power grinds, or no grinds at all. can't make em all happy
[3:35:01] mavericks312: @Sicknessqt you play other games
[3:35:03] crimsonbennie: yes i guess i just feel like there isnt much to do in bfa
[3:35:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Legion was better than all of them, sometimes simplicity is better
[3:35:05] spainard15: Do you think BFA would have been great with out the AP grind for the neck
[3:35:11] crimsonbennie: DF*
[3:35:34] snake_like: shadowlands had a LOT of cosmetics to grind
[3:35:36] Broomba: loved the grind in BfA and Legion
[3:35:44] spainard15: yeah your right sorry
[3:35:52] F_L_A_K_E_: the falling stars were waaay too op in bfa tho
[3:35:59] F_L_A_K_E_: or whatever they were called
[3:36:13] mavericks312: also for the guy who said Slands raids are better does he not remember sanctum and SoFo lol
[3:36:25] Rudric_Ice: hot take bring back titanforging
[3:36:27] Literae: Ive been playing since March 2005 and I have not hated an exp. There are some parts I liked and some parts I didnt. I just didnt do the parts I dont like. Simple solution.
[3:36:39] mavericks312: DF raids shit on S-lands raids
[3:36:45] Sicknessqt: @mavericks312  I do, but i wanna play wow
[3:36:50] zysmos: Halondrus
[3:36:52] mavericks312: minus nathria maybe
[3:36:57] wianord: sepulcher was awesome, just too long
[3:37:10] RolexKT: Fated was what made me like SL raids, I hated them in their release form
[3:37:14] snake_like: Sanctum was great to me. Sepulcher was overtuned but had interesting mechanics
[3:37:21] CardinalTX: @Literae stop being so level headed you maniac  Kappa LUL
[3:37:22] zysmos: Sepulcher was way too long yeah
[3:37:33] mavericks312: @Sicknessqt i mean you can farm cosmetics and mounts and stuff but blizz has said they want us to play other games an comeback for new patches
[3:37:39] Sicknessqt: @mavericks312  Like DF didnt even have any mounts to farm which i used to do alot in BFA and SL
[3:37:40] Sylphy_TV: Halondrus yaiks
[3:37:42] Literae: Nathria was both aesthetically pleasing and mechanically. The sets were beautiful too Kreygasm
[3:37:43] snake_like: moon2SUFFER I'm progging mythic sark still
[3:38:12] spainard15: Would you say that 4 tiers of same raid is good for the game like LFR Normal Heroic and Mythic or maybe just two raids .

[3:39:18] spainard15: thats insane
[3:39:23] dimofodi: my brother is like im a casual im like you have 2700io you are not casual
[3:39:35] Rudric_Ice: i think mythic raids needs to be nerfed heavily after 3-4 months so tht even casual guilds can do it
[3:39:45] Molvonos: Ehh
[3:39:55] Tessiuz: whats the point of calling it mythic then
[3:39:59] Eviltuna13: Even people who say they hate LFR do them
[3:40:01] Tessiuz: its supposed to be hard :P
[3:40:06] dimofodi: @Rudric_Ice Why do casual guilds need to be able to do the hardest content in the game?
[3:40:11] Wrizzik: if you drop difficulty, people will stop playing
[3:40:12] Molvonos: There's a weird distinction with having 'Mythic' level difficulty able to be done by casual players.
[3:40:30] Chronollo: Do you think they will announce new xpac in the upcoming blizzcon?
[3:40:34] Molvonos: It's hard for a reason, not because of raw numbers.  Nerfing the choreo required would make it heroic.
[3:40:52] Molvonos: Casuals can do heroic raiding at the moment, so it's all good.
[3:41:08] KaisenSiru: Need more Mythic Sepulcher levels of difficulty awkwHypedance
[3:41:14] abracka_: wouldn't mind seeing LFR be removed, but normal be queuable
[3:41:15] Rudric_Ice: WHY NOT let the casual players  have their fun most people can even do mythic raids after the next expansion
[3:41:19] falldrgn: @Chronollo I think thats a safe bet.
[3:41:22] Rudric_Ice: cant*
[3:41:23] Tessiuz: totally, i think theyve found a nice balance with hc, its very doable for casual players
[3:41:26] Darkside1366: Oh no is the pally did I miss it
[3:41:30] dimofodi: To me, that just doesn't make sense. A casual guild can see everything the raid has to offer except 1 or 2 mechanics per boss? Is it for the gear? Why should they get the best gear without putting in the same work, just for waiting a couple months they get free gear?
[3:41:41] Molvonos: If casual players felt mythic raiding was fun, they'd be mythic raiders.
[3:41:44] Molvonos: And not casual.

[3:42:45] Chronollo: @Towelliee I wonder if they will announce anything about future of classic in blizzcon, I'd reckon so since ICC would alrdy be over and harcdcore's already been out for a bit
[3:42:54] mavericks312: if anything just make normal queable
[3:42:58] abracka_: i mean, normal and LFR almost have no differences whatsoever anymore
[3:43:02] DunzoCD: I enjoy being a casual Heroic raider and having a slightly worse ilvl than mythic raiders
[3:43:02] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:43:38] mavericks312: @DunzoCD i agree my heroic raid team is good enough
[3:43:40] Literae: Story Mode > Normal Mode > HC/M Mode. Easy / Medium / Hard. Thats all you really need. I like LFR so I can experience the raid thats all. Tourist mode.
[3:43:41] Molvonos: Casual players do not need access to the best gear.  Saying that as a casual player who does heroic raiding and up to +20s in M+.  They get the best gear to do the hardest content.
[3:44:18] Darkside1366: I think the system is balanced for once I don’t want to be forced to raid to get Tier I like the catalyst system so I can do my M+ and still get my tier to make the spec more fun
[3:44:19] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos bro u aint a casual if you're doing heroic and +20s
[3:44:33] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice I play 2 days a week.  How is that not casual?
[3:44:40] SilverLynx87: tbh I think casuals should still be able to get the best gear but it just takes much longer.
[3:44:59] Molvonos: I said I do up to +20s, not that I do a hundred of them in a week.
[3:45:01] abracka_: @Molvonos casual does not mean you only do LFR and +2-8 keys
[3:45:17] mavericks312: hot take WoW would almost die without LFR
[3:45:23] wianord: casuals can pretty much get the best gear just from doing a couple keys every week
[3:45:36] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos days dont mean anything the content u are engaging with does
[3:45:44] Molvonos: That's simply not true.
[3:46:32] Literae: I think there should be more of a jump between the raid difficulties. 400ilevel - 420 ilevel etc. Shouldnt just be able to stomp the next difficulty with previous difficulty gear.
[3:46:43] DunzoCD: tbh just doing DotI every week gives you alot of pieces of crafted 447 gear which is mythic raiding ilvl
[3:47:15] Molvonos: Fuck that noise, I'm lazy as hell.
[3:47:20] Molvonos: Give me my free loot.
[3:47:21] mavericks312: WoW boomers want retail to be vanilla all over again
[3:47:40] DevilSpire: im suprised normal isnt queable now
[3:47:44] Ruger153: Yea when I was playing retail I loved it. Get to enjoy the raids without having to invest so much time.
[3:47:52] Clicklesly: They should get rid of Mythic Raids, i never stepped foot into one Kappa
[3:47:57] hellxpaco: some people just have only time for that
[3:47:58] Nebulizer87: i've helped some very casual guilds that literally can only do LFR and normal
[3:47:59] RolexKT: Lfr is definitely good for the game, can help people determine if they like to raid at all
[3:48:05] CardinalTX: Im a WoW boomer and i dont want vanilla back  LUL
[3:48:18] Nebulizer87: no matter if i give them guides or try to help they just play the game how they want
[3:48:23] Nebulizer87: props to them
[3:48:24] MeisterPetze: i got a son now and got no time for a guild. i love the lfr cassuial raidshit
[3:48:26] Mecabeast: I don't like lfr because most people I've queued with in lfr give 0 fucks about other people's time
[3:48:28] PokerFaceMoose: its nice only commit to 3ish bosses too. i dont have to commit to all 8+ at a time
[3:48:32] Molvonos: It really does.
[3:48:32] Gelomorte: Plus it makes the end boss of the patch accessible for everyone to experience which I liked when I didnt have time to play as much
[3:48:58] Thoreya: would be nice to que normal and heroic too
[3:49:02] spainard15: Nice
[3:49:08] DunzoCD: you arent wrong, I was runnin normal every week for class trinket and we shifted the raid every boss
[3:49:11] KaisenSiru: Fresh off the press!
[3:49:14] Molvonos: I will say this @Towelliee.  It was INCREDIBLY SATISFYING to get my Evoker Leggo in a Heroic PUG Sark, when I didn't get it in the raid my raid group did earlier but didnt clear Sark.

[3:57:28] dscholl82: yeah I've had the hiatal hernia for like a decade.  doctors were always like "it's not bad enough to warrant surgery"   then i had an X-ray 2 months ago for something else and my doctor was like "uhhhhhh holy shit dude, we need to treat this"

[3:59:56] valianya: Losing weight relieves pressure on your organs which pushed up into chest cavity less.  Hernia doesn't go away, but the organs pressing out become less and size is reduced.  Smaller hernia makes surgery easier and less risk of popping the repair from high pressure
[4:00:41] MeasleyBeasley: Is it hard to find a guild in hardcore, I was thinking about playing it.
[4:01:14] segarth: hernia surgery?

[4:06:44] GitaxiasPrime: i could see making wow free on gamepass up to lvl 20 then require the sub just making the game itself free with expansions
[4:06:48] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee While Mike said what he said, it also could very well be the fact he had to say that for legal, SEC reasons as not to be doing wonky things with stocks and stuff.

[4:08:48] mavericks312: also spencer said if any of actiblizz games were gonna be on gamepass it would take up to 5 years
[4:08:55] Dark_Kornax: Did you die on the paladin?
[4:09:00] valianya: Microsoft merger is more about changing how Blizzard is managed by MS game dept rather than Activision board.  It likely will give Blizzard Ybarra more free reign in how to develop WoW the way the long term design philosophy changed after Shadowlands mess
[4:09:04] zlinkly: They bought them for King, the mobile market
[4:09:06] Shugaze: wow on xbox is money just waiting to happen
[4:09:18] Sollice: They say that Microsoft really wanted King
[4:09:23] kokochris: I've been in a number of mergers in the tech field over the last 20 years... its easily a 2-5 year plan for changes to really show
[4:09:24] Sollice: get that mobile money
[4:09:30] delavor1: its not like you take over a profitable company and you change everything right away, that would be a disaster
[4:09:45] VindrGrohiik: King?
[4:09:47] Shugaze: infinite Boomer money drain the King games
[4:09:48] mavericks312: mobile games for MS and sony make the most money
[4:09:53] spainard15: Isnt King played by a lot old people
[4:10:09] Shugaze: @spainard15 they got all that disposable money

[4:10:35] mavericks312: @spainard15 yea candy crush but those same ppl probably dont know this is happening
[4:10:39] Armdel: unless they start underperforming they'll likely be left as for the forseable future
[4:11:05] zeiours: Phil Spencer wants to make his class powerful in wow, that's why they bought it
[4:11:09] kokochris: I heards we were getting a new spell for Warlocks... Cast Blue screen of death.  Causes the PVE or PVP player affected to be immediately deleted
[4:11:39] valianya: Also part of the agreement to get approved to not be exclusionary to the market by delaying putting ActiBlizzard titles on gamepass
[4:11:39] HooDGorE: D4 needs help

[4:17:05] PotbellyGoat: it's boring AF
[4:17:09] Molvonos: I don't understand how people say that D2 has more endgame than D3/D4.
[4:17:12] CatDumpZ: those kill all quests in the dung. man i hate those quinW
[4:17:16] Molvonos: Its the same shit
[4:17:17] Nebulizer87: travesty they even call those things dungeons
[4:17:49] Nebulizer87: D2 is a perfect game
[4:17:56] Nebulizer87: farming rare gear
[4:17:57] neftario105: @Towelliee good morning wha server u play hard core?
[4:17:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: d2 endgame is play the game again
[4:18:00] auddydee: Magic find or duels
[4:18:03] GitaxiasPrime: D2 End game was farming the runes and runewords and then PVPing
[4:18:06] aspiration89: Just farming
[4:18:09] vaironixx: d2s items were better
[4:18:13] Molvonos: "Perfect Game" my ass, lmao.
[4:18:16] Molvonos: Biased as fuck.
[4:18:21] NickLeonhearth: get to lvl 99
[4:18:22] Nebulizer87: items mattered in D2
[4:18:23] Wellfleet: farming and ubers/dclone
[4:18:25] auddydee: Dueling
[4:18:29] Pickl3z: D2 end game was endless farming for 0.01% drops and buying shit for real money on third party websites
[4:18:37] Day_Walker78: D2 dosen't have more end game then D4
[4:18:39] Ruger153: There is an end in d2, d4 is the treadmill.
[4:18:40] asmodai4823: its a game made in 2000
[4:18:46] mavericks312: diablo fans out here holding up D2 like wow players do wrath
[4:18:47] Molvonos: @Ruger153 You have that backwards.
[4:18:47] ContraRob: D2 would fail hard with current gamers if it came out today, IMO. It's nostalgia
[4:18:55] Ruger153: Hardcore d2 is the endgame.
[4:18:55] slowhellcat: d2 had good balance between leveling/farming/pvp for end game
[4:18:59] kokochris: it doesntr
[4:19:05] Molvonos: D4 caps at level 100 with a very clear 'end'.

[4:19:07] GitaxiasPrime: D4 lacks trading which gives no purpose to farming uniques and stuff D2 had Runes, Runewords, uniques, torches, charms, i mean just TRADING made the game great
[4:19:20] asmodai4823: it would be shit because its 2023
[4:19:37] DunzoCD: people dont remember people complained back then too, they thought runewords "made the grind too easy"
[4:19:42] segarth: i never play diablo games for the endgame, it seems pointless to me and not much fun
[4:19:43] aspiration89: @Enigmatic_0ne I think you're right. Trading was a huge part of D2.
[4:19:45] Nebulizer87: i mean i still go back and play D2remastered ladder season
[4:19:57] GitaxiasPrime: the currency grind was enough to hold EVERYONE in
[4:20:01] Nebulizer87: it takes awhile to get a 'perfect' setup in D2
[4:20:03] asmodai4823: but d2 was good for its time d4 isnt KEKW
[4:20:10] GitaxiasPrime: it created an INSANE community aswell
[4:20:15] Ruger153: @Molvonos I disagree. If you're going off levels, d2 has 99. D2 also has an end with items.
[4:20:16] Nebulizer87: imagine if D4 uber uniques actually had a drop chance
[4:20:17] Psydac01: wish my server would be so empty in westfall.. so many gnolls alive
[4:20:46] mavericks312: probably rods malignant tuneels
[4:20:55] mikemills88: im not impressed with D4 at the moment, had high hopes in season 1 but now its just meh
[4:20:58] Rottencoarse: @mavericks312  LMAO
[4:20:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: if each season keeps me busy for a couple weeks its fine with me, i have no desire to play d4 full time
[4:21:11] Molvonos: @Ruger153 You endlessly grind, there's no end.  The 'Level 100' thing I mentioned is a full-stop end.  The gear stops at a certain point, the Nightmare Dungeons stop at level 100, the penultimate boss doesnt magically become more difficult when you kill her.  You're done.
[4:21:14] neftario105: !server
[4:21:17] Nebulizer87: i wouldn't mind if Rod had any clue about what his diablo teams were doing
[4:21:18] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i dunno but rod should not be there doing idiotic stuff
[4:21:35] Nebulizer87: that 'nerf' patch literally killed the game
[4:21:51] mikemills88: @HaxzorJimDuggan same, play and get your rewards then move on until the next season.. rinse repeat
[4:22:29] asmodai4823: thats shit game design KEKW
[4:22:49] mikemills88: @Nebulizer87 rod needs to stay behind a desk
[4:22:52] PotbellyGoat: almost like they have no idea what they are doing
[4:22:56] Brodih_: what does the gem do?
[4:23:18] Molvonos: @Brodih_ Stores crit damage, amplifies it, and then makes it explode to do AOE crit damage.
[4:23:40] Ruger153: @Molvonos Could you give me an d2 example related to what you just said that differs?

[4:24:30] mikemills88: isnt season 2 just going to be a reskined season 1? from zombies to vampires
[4:24:53] Brodih_: yay, thanks for the info! @Molvonos
[4:25:08] mavericks312: and you hope more of the new seasons mobs actually spawn
[4:25:24] Nebulizer87: imagine vampire season came with the diablo immortal class
[4:25:37] Nebulizer87: i'd pay $20 dollaredoos
[4:25:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: the vampiric affix is pretty shit though so hopefully that gets tuned
[4:26:30] segarth: death to porcine entourage LUL

[4:26:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  check around the farms for the oats
[4:26:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: the health drain
[4:27:06] HoboFighter2: He just means the current affix on elites which already exists

[4:27:33] Rudric_Ice: copium
[4:28:08] zeiours: Wow 10.2 announcement start of October?
[4:28:15] mavericks312: can we talk about how lilith an inarius are fucking oerators in CoD now

[4:29:03] mikemills88: @Rottencoarse i dont think they have an idea of how to fix resistance. not sure they ever knew how to make it work in the first place

[4:29:18] AjaxGamingTTV: If you know, you know
[4:29:28] mavericks312: @mikemills88 yea i seen that shit yesterday
[4:29:44] zeiours: After blizzcon? Wouldn't that ruin the 10.2 raid cinematic, as we would know what next xpac is by than?
[4:30:05] Molvonos: Logic?  Aint no one got time for that
[4:30:19] mavericks312: @zeiours i mean we kinda know what 11.0 already is

[6:09:05] ronny_84: Bell just did a new video complaining about m+
[6:09:06] abracka_: he was running with mods too so he probably doesn't want to stream it and get banned for that
[6:09:10] abracka_: the base UI in XIV is so ugly
[6:09:12] Stevedionys: do you find DF bnoring?
[6:09:16] Stevedionys: boring *
[6:09:40] CardinalTX: Im playing some comfy swtor today
[6:09:40] PvtHudson093: we were born in the toxic

[6:09:43] kithelle: They're nice if you like their game*  my sister in law plays.  You are NOT allowed to say anything negative about it
[6:09:45] Diisplaced: lets just have multiple MMOs succeed so the MMO community itself is thriving
[6:09:50] DunzoCD: lol imagine caring that much about how somebody else decides to enjoy the game you play
[6:09:50] CloudPants8081: cooksuXchamp  no anime games sponsor? Kappa
[6:10:01] Jarlan23: the lalafel highchair drama was legit the funniest drama of any game ive read about ever
[6:10:06] theDirtyon3: Max just had a UI addon and people freaked out LUL
[6:10:12] oxie73: So my origin gaming desk top should hopefully be here today
[6:10:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: ff14 needs to fix the ability bloat again, way too many
[6:10:33] mavericks312: its funny cause ff 14 fans thought RwF players werent gonna use addons an stuff
[6:11:05] Molvonos: OH YEA
[6:11:09] mavericks312: are you guys testing the dragon riding boss today?
[6:11:17] Molvonos: ITS BASIC WHITE GIRL SEASON AGAIN.  Time to stock up on Pumpkin Spice.
[6:11:23] CardinalTX: Now Zelpa and others are doing vids about being burned out on FFXIX and how endwalker has no content
[6:11:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: abilities that combo off each other just need to be one icon, like one of the addons do
[6:11:51] theDirtyon3: yeah
[6:11:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like Zepla
[6:11:56] asmodai4823: its just the end of the expansion for it
[6:12:17] TheUnknowing: endwalker is probably the least invested ive been in FF14, typically im atleast playing a month or two every new patch but havent been this expac
[6:12:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: they have a lot of small patches but most of those are done in a couple hours unless you savage raid
[6:12:21] Nebulizer87: they usually have some grinds they can do end of expansion, this time around they don't will be rough
[6:12:25] oxie73: what kind of dog you have?
[6:12:32] Sicknessqt: that whole game feels like a drought  for me LUL
[6:12:47] ArcaneSyntax: Apparently they had a SL launch style drought and ended with 4 bosses
[6:12:51] asmodai4823: the ff14 devs are too conservative with updates
[6:12:51] TheUnknowing: endwalker start was great for sure but yeah, fell off after IMO
[6:12:52] mavericks312: so is endwalker FF 14s shadowlands

[6:20:25] HoffaFiles: those Disney pin trading groups are no joke, so I don't doubt a video game by them would be crazy as well

[8:02:01] valianya: @wachumeean play Dragonflight and make a Dracthyr Evoker.  It will guide you into Dragonflight.  Death Knight also has a guided starting experience.  The new player experience now starts in BfA and is slightly more guided than old starting zones.  But you really need to follow each zone's questline as a guide.  It's easier since Cataclysm to follow old world zone's questlines because of quests consolidated at hub locations
[8:02:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: We love more armor
[8:03:45] valianya: Do all quests in a hub area and you'll get breadcrumb quests sending you to next hub location

[8:03:54] Rudric_Ice: @Wachumeean and if u wanna play retail wow u start from the BFA expansion basically u do all quests and story and get to lvl 60 if u find the game fun only then buy the next expansion which is the current expansion that is dragonflight then u basically do the same thing again as BFA the story, the quests

[8:09:15] valianya: BfA and Dragonflight, and Shadowlands too but I don't suggest going there from BfA, instead skip to Dragonflight, made the main story questline easier to distinguish from side stuff.  I will warn that because of how new endgame story chapters are added as separate from prior endgame story chapters, you can end up doing later parts of the expansion storyline before doing earlier expansion storyline chapters

[8:13:56] valianya: Most important advice is take your time.  Don't pay attention to people saying it only starts at endgame max level.  If you're interested in the story at all, take your time.  It's overwhelming how much is available for new players just from previous expansions.  Follow the questlines will both introduce you to the expansions storyline and guide you on where to go next.

[9:01:55] zysmos: that guy brought the addon argument to compare FF and WoW raiding
[9:02:35] Korupcija_: I just can't agree with that, specially for debuffs that are already displayed on your character
[9:02:39] DunzoCD: saving the casual gamers of wow a few determination stacks
[9:02:58] Korupcija_: magmarox soaks you don't need addon as well, it's always different groups of people
[9:03:03] frenzr: That was a question, you are the one brought arguments @zysmos
[9:03:34] madbombz_fth: madbombz_fth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[9:04:07] zysmos: @frenzr I mean you said Blizz designs raids with addons in mind I don't think it's true for non mythic raiding that's it
[9:04:51] MrSapiotv: whats your add on for interface
[9:05:02] Rudric_Ice: @zysmos i bet u cant do a normal raid without using addons

[9:09:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Most guilds in general require a few addons

[9:10:44] Korupcija_: mythic
[9:11:01] Korupcija_: a warlock
[9:11:03] frenzr: @korupcija_  I don’t believe you don’t use any addon, because you need addon to track your debuff/ rotation etc

[9:12:23] Rudric_Ice: well hes just built different
[9:12:30] mavericks312: This man is raiding mythic WoD raids lol
[9:12:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's definitely unusual at the least, but possible in some way
[9:12:42] abracka_: someone get max in here, this man needs signed to liquid
[9:12:44] frenzr: @korupcija_ class addon is also addon.
[9:12:44] Raptorskulz: I think i found his warlock, in a rank 1300 guild and private logs, hmm
[9:13:04] zysmos: You're making it difficult for yourself tho
[9:13:06] DunzoCD: @PoemoeGamingTTV then id look at the class discord to see whats best atm idk for sure sorry
[9:13:09] zysmos: LUL
[9:13:10] Raptorskulz: wait, his guild was rank 300ish before it imploded on sark LUL
[9:13:24] Ezcotli: I play with no mouse and keyboard Kappa
[9:13:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: It would definitely increase the difficulty, and a player would likely wipe the raid and make their lives tougher
[9:13:37] Korupcija_: it's always at the same spot, but ofc I use addon for that as I said
[9:13:40] mejiro151: you all play with monitors?
[9:13:42] Decree22: I would like to see some of his logs

[9:18:39] frenzr: The problem is that I found myself researching how to use addon correctly more often than how to actually play my classes/ boss fight

[10:45:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: If dragon riding is the wall, I guess it is better that it's not one of the first few bosses, so most people can get a couple of kills at least
