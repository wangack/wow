[1:22:14] TalkSickGirl: Voice isn't always reliable because voice changers and there are some people who don't have feminine voices
[1:22:20] Fostethesnowman: I sound like a girl when I scream
[1:22:23] DebbieCackes90: LUL voice doesnt tell you much
[1:22:27] bassdevil: no I have a deep voice :(

[1:23:21] ambiros: hiiii everyone nessieWalk
[1:23:22] TalkSickGirl: The issue is that it was a women's only event and a team full of men showed up..
[1:23:35] Fostethesnowman: I think they were first no?
[1:23:35] bassdevil: @DebbieCackes90 wow NotLikeThis
[1:23:41] TalkSickGirl: Like doesn't matter how they performed it matters that they took the opportunity from another team
[1:23:51] 9KindsOfKhaos: I hope they were getting their ass kicked
[1:24:06] DebbieCackes90: @TalkSickGirl That, right
[1:24:08] XcaLiBeR_TV: problem is you shouldnt have to prove anything. its sad that the honor system doesnt get followed by people sometimes

[1:24:57] XcaLiBeR_TV: get that fire goin andrew my feet are cold
[1:25:39] TalkSickGirl: But it's the same reason people cheat, no honor and their greed fuels them to do whatever they want regardless of how it affects other people

[1:25:46] Empress_Wubwub: I can't remember if MDY White is actually good or if they were the team that everyone made fun of for being so bad...
