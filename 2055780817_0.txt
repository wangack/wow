[0:54:22] Pups_Gersky: Oh the other big thing change people aren't happy with are the mount prices being put back to vanilla prices.
[0:54:29] ackdogg007: What is going to be funny is the people that think they are going to to 40 in like 5 to 10 hours . When it's going to start taking like 3 to 4 hours just to get 1 Level

[0:54:46] Wcvechten: probably just something fun
[0:54:56] GodKingMuninn: Depends if the STV mount is rideable anywhere

[2:16:32] Pups_Gersky: Doing BFD tomorrow?
[2:16:36] ackdogg007: It's called just play the damn game it's not like there is a prize for getting to 40 first it's more like congratz now you have nothing to do for the next few months
[2:16:47] Allexi88: Just have to make sure you don't hit your daily instance cap
[2:16:48] Miko2121: then go back make a ton of gold doing those quests
[2:16:50] Rhymm: the exp boost is only from 1-25, right?
[2:16:56] tlsmith3638: doubled ?
[2:16:58] bluenos3r: how much is mount?
[2:17:04] tlsmith3638: it not 100g?
[2:17:30] Funeryl: the mount was 40g 1-25 and now they double it?
[2:17:31] Miko2121: is it not 45g for mount ?
[2:17:35] bluenos3r: I thought it was 100 minus reputation rewards
[2:17:42] Noshpan: Mount prices technically didn't double. They were reset to their original classic prices
[2:17:54] bluenos3r: that’ll for sure lessen good buying /s. idiots
[2:17:58] Alcaeus_: ^
[2:18:02] bluenos3r: gold**
[2:18:06] Sir_KnightErrant: yea thats what i thought too. i had planned for 100g per toon
[2:18:13] Bowwjack: @Towelliee I think that the fact that there is a RWF for classic in general is halarious
[2:18:13] SinicalDev: It was lowered in SOM but they put it back to normal
[2:18:16] maventar: dont forget about training too
[2:18:32] Zapp_Brannigan86: even if you played SoD casual it would be hard not to have that gold saved up

[2:18:39] TombStoneMercenary: the old hurry up and wait

[2:18:41] force_FMD: we need something fresh again
[2:18:42] bluenos3r: too expensive
[2:18:44] Funeryl: i think p1 was about 2 weeks long imo
[2:18:46] Shamwise: lul
[2:18:53] goosejamss: @Sir_KnightErrant one per toon yeah

[2:19:10] Niksen_99: Classic era needs a fresh those servers are 5 years old
[2:19:23] Funeryl: true
[2:19:27] force_FMD: SOD BC and Wrath is going to be interesting
[2:19:28] goosejamss: @Sir_KnightErrant anyone with only 1 toon issn't running gnomer anyways
[2:19:34] Exodeo_: I mean that's like retail pvp players saying the game is dead too because they only pvp and queue times are long
[2:19:37] bluenos3r: Jesus this guy running 600 fps

[2:20:45] elactix2gg: Do any of the tanks have a spammy rotation like on retail if you understand but on SoD i think no am i correct?

[2:57:16] goosejamss: @BreakerG1 wut no it is not
[2:57:19] MajorDumpsterFire: Making sure not to release the runes and boioks early this time probably
[2:57:20] LeXieSterling: I can't I be the only one.
[2:57:34] Krazie_J: rehiding the runes
[2:57:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard there is going to be a world boss in Stranglethorn that one-shots people, in SOD LUL
[2:57:43] LeXieSterling: Oh I see
[2:57:44] lostrealist: that's a lot of cards to frame for a full base set
[2:57:57] BreakerG1: @Molvonos classic wow wrath? im doing a jc daily right now, or are we talking about something else?
[2:58:04] Molvonos: That isn't classic.
[2:58:05] lostrealist: maybe just one franchise would be cool
[2:58:12] Molvonos: That's some bullshit garbage version.
[2:58:14] goosejamss: wrath =/= classic
[2:58:17] Exodeo_: @BreakerG1 SoD , not wrath :p
[2:58:19] aspiration89: @aspiration89 Love it. I have the white one with the mesh side panel. I was slightly concerned about temps, but I'm running an air cooled system and have no issues. Just be sure your GPU will fit :D
[2:58:20] Treevinal: Josh out there in an easter bunny tmog hiding runes, that is what I picture
[2:58:32] BreakerG1: @Exodeo_ ah, my b
[2:58:51] chriar: the rares and srs in one piece are worthless
[2:59:03] chriar: its only the alt arts that have value
[2:59:08] goosejamss: @BreakerG1 no worries man you were juust trying to help
[2:59:34] Sollice: @Towelliee Origin Neuron 2030 with 14900k, 4080 super, 32 Gb DDR5 6000 240MM Liquid CPU cooler. So you should be able to get something pretty banger for giveaway
[2:59:37] LeXieSterling: Ya some one like me. I would love to put together a few in a frame and hang in my gaming room.
[2:59:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Sollice I'm waiting on the new Noctua 140mm fans before I do another case build
[3:00:07] BreakerG1: @goosejamss ive been calling classic "classic" for so long, now sod comes out and takes the name, i just get c onfused sometimes lol
[3:00:33] Sollice: @aspiration89 Yeah I was going to do black with side mesh. I do have a large 4080 but I think GN said they would fit. I wish they did the hunter green case and wood front panel like the tera
[3:00:48] goosejamss: @BreakerG1 fair, wrath is classic to retail but since there is a classic classic it's hard to just call wrath 'classic' rn
[3:00:50] hisfrankness: Good woman right there. Bringing ya eats. <3
[3:00:50] Rexy95: @Sollice could also go abit cheaper and maybe get 2 for one ? :P
[3:01:03] ProClicker: I remember when I was a kid everyone wanted the Marvel Masterpieces cards. Those things ended up not being worth jack

[3:02:05] hisfrankness: Do you play on an Origin PC, Towelliee?

[3:02:45] paulson14: be like 50k
[3:02:54] AstroStoleMars: huge workstation/server
[3:02:55] luckfore: need a small loan of a million dollars for that
[3:02:57] Sollice: It's not a server. It's more like a graphic workstation kind of thing
[3:03:00] MattyNiceTV: you could multibox on it haha
[3:03:06] gothen123: I see
[3:03:09] aspiration89: Yeah, workstation. Looks sick
[3:03:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: wtf is this
[3:03:17] goosejamss: @MattyNiceTV you could run your own gd server on that LULW
[3:03:19] AstroStoleMars: gotcga
[3:03:33] MattyNiceTV: @goosejamss truth
[3:03:45] MattyNiceTV: you could run your own AV
[3:03:55] aspiration89: Wait. They're doing rackmount workstations now too? That's awesome.
[3:04:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 4080 Super is only a little faster than the 4080 but still a truly amazing card for games like WoW
[3:04:11] goosejamss: 4.5K for a pc that is wild
[3:04:24] goosejamss: I need to upgrade but these prices are scary
[3:04:41] Sollice: I would love to see Origin offer 14 inch laptops
[3:04:54] CeruleanStar: CeruleanStar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! morning
[3:05:00] goosejamss: I run WoW on a 10 y/o GPU
[3:05:02] AstroStoleMars: still alot of money to me lol

[3:05:47] izabeL: wonder what their interest rate is
[3:05:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah something like a 4070 Ti Super is a way better deal than things were, it's around $799 for that card now
[3:05:49] AstroStoleMars: 7k for a pc ? lol

[3:05:57] goosejamss: oh nice
[3:06:11] CeruleanStar: $2100 for a 4090 is wild tho
[3:06:13] itscityboy: @AstroStoleMars mine is around 4k. 7 would have to have some insane stuff in it
[3:06:32] jarilrpg: @shiningteemo cause people can't afford anything anymore, you can even make payments on your pizzas
[3:06:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: got my car for 0% interest 6 years
[3:06:43] Sollice: I would love to go to a chronos small form factor pc
[3:06:57] mahz: Every 5 years or so
[3:06:58] AstroStoleMars: @itscityboy dude wtf are you guys doing lol it has to be for rendering or video editing
[3:06:59] izabeL: I just upgrade parts here and there
[3:07:02] itscityboy: same pc from 2019
[3:07:02] High_Forge: 10 for me
[3:07:05] aspiration89: I did until a few months. Had it for like 6 years.
[3:07:06] Molvonos: I built my computer during Covid and it's still pretty top of the line.
[3:07:08] shiningteemo: @jarilrpg ya things just getting more expensive. it’s outpacing what people actually make
[3:07:10] bullorbear420: i got a nice laptop with a 3070 in it that i got a year ago
[3:07:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the 4090s are still way expensive, but upper midrange cards like 7900 XT are getting cheaper
[3:07:14] Truckwood: @Towelliee such a slow wait for  phase 2 since monday. feels like its been weeks
[3:07:17] MelloniteGaming: I upgrade parts every year.  Its an affliction.
[3:07:17] JQ47: Building your own is also not as hard as it use to be
[3:07:18] MoonwalkingAngel: i stick to console i cant afford 2000 dollars every 3-4 years
[3:07:19] jarilrpg: @Sollice i got one and am regretting it, can't upgrade cause everything only just barely fits
[3:07:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: i went from a 980ti to the 3080
[3:07:21] CeruleanStar: my wifes computer has a ? 9900k/1080? upgrading to a ryzen 9 7950x3d and 4090
[3:07:22] warrenny: i bought mine at sl release. upgraded ram but still same pc
[3:07:26] dustyzoose: Especially for wow , can run that on anything
[3:07:30] Ezcotli: Mine is 12 years old with upgrades though
[3:07:40] Sollice: @jarilrpg Yeah its definitly you need to pick what your happy with when you build it
[3:07:45] goosejamss: @AstroStoleMars nah it's just gaming, but companies are able to upsell everyone bc of twitch. everyone wants the streamer setup
[3:07:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah WoW doesn't take that much to run
[3:07:51] itscityboy: @itscityboy 4090 is most of the price tbh. 64gb RAM, ryzen 9, liquid cooling etc. Mainly use it for gaming
[3:08:02] olboll: still rocking 2070 super
[3:08:03] ProClicker: I  got a 2080, when the 3000 series came out I felt like crap
[3:08:10] CeruleanStar: a buddy is using my old PC i build in 2012 still- replaced only the power supply lol
[3:08:11] devildriver1919: my 1080 is about to die, i cant even raid 20 man raids anymore otherwise comp feels like its gonan stroke out
[3:08:14] im_capy: I just "upgrade" my wifes with my old stuff, and buy new stuff for me :)
[3:08:15] jarilrpg: @Sollice i am having crashing problems with the 2080 in it, and i cant upgrade
[3:08:19] goosejamss: what in the actual fk do you need 64 GB of RAM for lmao
[3:08:22] Ezcotli: Mother board and cpu 12 years
[3:08:25] AstroStoleMars: @goosejamss ah I understand now that makes alot of sense
[3:08:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm currently on a 7800 XT and it's way more than enough for WoW
[3:08:39] MoonwalkingAngel: he putted aferrarri engine in a ford
[3:08:56] im_capy: Xbox is like....want a console? hold my beer
[3:09:00] MelloniteGaming: what do you think about MS releasing WoW on console?
[3:09:01] MasterNeff: What class are you leveing first for Phase 2 ?
[3:09:02] Ganondood: 1070 gang wya...
[3:09:04] spansonite1: towIgnit
[3:09:07] goosejamss: @AstroStoleMars also the way games are going, you need a new GPU to even play them on medium setting
[3:09:13] AstroStoleMars: I have 32 gb of ram and I think thats enough for anything
[3:09:16] CeruleanStar: my wife and I just alternate upgrades --- so next year i'll make my own new pc (i'm on a 2080) but when i build my next PC it's full custom, giving myself a 10k budget
[3:09:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Phil Spencer has a vision
[3:09:22] Sollice: XBOX has wanted to be a software brand for a while
[3:09:26] im_capy: There new systems are cloud based
[3:09:28] Sollice: They want to bring MS titles to PS now
[3:09:32] futomara01: xbox exclusives suck anyway
[3:09:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: rumor they are putting their exclusives on 3rd parties
[3:09:37] Ezekyler: next we will know, but looks like they wil release some Xbox exclusives to Playstation
[3:09:42] Ezekyler: week*
[3:09:47] FruckAwesome: finally got the heartbreaker yesterday, weeeee
[3:09:55] im_capy: Terrible exclusives
[3:09:56] Sollice: @Towelliee Console never make them money
[3:09:59] sircheex: I mean even the xbox one they wanted to make a 'media system' not a game console
[3:10:00] FruckAwesome: and yea the money is never in HW in consoles
[3:10:03] goosejamss: really? xbox 360 sold really well
[3:10:05] Sollice: I don't know even if Sony breaks even yet on PS5
[3:10:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Traditionally the consoles always lost money on the hardware and made it back on the games
[3:10:08] MoonwalkingAngel: they never recoverd after xbox 1 stuff
[3:10:11] sircheex: I'm wondering if they want to move their loss leader from hardware to gamepass
[3:10:12] ProClicker: I think GTA 6 will come out at the same time as the consoles this time
[3:10:12] im_capy: Halo is about all Xbox had to carry it
[3:10:19] Shearkahn: Same with Playstation when they started putting blueray in it
[3:10:26] Sollice: @ProClicker I dont think so. I think they already said it wouldn't
[3:10:37] demonicyoshi: halo does carry anything other than a trash can lol
[3:10:41] FruckAwesome: xbox was basically a custom PC anyway
[3:10:44] goosejamss: interesting
[3:10:46] MoonwalkingAngel: xbox 360 and og xb was legit good
[3:10:50] FruckAwesome: kidna sorta is the PS5
[3:11:00] DeckantTV: what's the 50% xp boost in?
[3:11:02] AstroStoleMars: @goosejamss yeah thats true , im doing fine for now with my 2070 at 1440p but i also don't play alot of AAA titles like I use too
[3:11:03] goosejamss: 360 was nuts for its time, tons of incredible games
[3:11:03] Sollice: @FruckAwesome That's no different than Playstation. They both use AMD APUs and off the shelf DDR
[3:11:05] demonicyoshi: 343 said after this current update for halo there will not be anymore updates made to the game

[3:11:29] AzedaNA: Sony does all their consoles on a 10 year timeline
[3:11:31] CeruleanStar: PS3 was a loss because of that special chip
[3:11:34] Ezekyler: Sony lost money when launched PS4
[3:11:48] im_capy: Game pass is probably dead too
[3:11:49] MoonwalkingAngel: xbox turning into sega rip
[3:11:56] im_capy: it has never made them money
[3:12:12] ProClicker: We need Sega to make a come back

[3:12:18] Sollice: I wish Sony would bring their titles to PC faster. I would love to play all of their PS5 releases but I am not going to buy a PS5
[3:12:22] AzedaNA: Microsoft is literally making a play to only have Game Pass and be the Netflix of games. Kill off physical copies and crank up that sub price
[3:12:22] jarilrpg: well they have those TVs with gamepass built into them (don't know how well they run it though)
[3:12:28] goosejamss: @AstroStoleMars it's tough bc I can run 75% of new games on low settings and 100 fps, even Cyberpunk. but it does take away from the gameplay a bit when I could be at 200 fps with ultra settings

[3:13:27] MattyNiceTV: march 15
[3:13:33] Shearkahn: same as PS4 as it took 6 months before they stopped selling at a loss
[3:13:42] Dragunstorm15: @mattynicetv the show isn’t PlayStation exclusive it’s on Xbox
[3:13:45] im_capy: "We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned"
[3:14:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is possible they go away from making a bunch of consoles to more publishing games
[3:14:26] AzedaNA: Game Pass is the future play. They want to snuff out physical and be Netflix of games
[3:14:29] VIIKON: @Towelliee whats best tanks for raid and M+ atm?

[3:15:15] Raddius: New XBox is a VR headset only.  You can play it while your Cybertruck is driving you around.
[3:15:24] FruckAwesome: @Screamnsteam gratz
[3:15:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would assume they will still make an Xbox console, but it could be more for the high end
[3:15:36] reggiepowa: just got leggo on my warr, blp finally kicking in
[3:15:44] RandomDadGuy: new ELVUI update
[3:16:03] MoonwalkingAngel: thats not good sony needs competion
[3:16:03] AzedaNA: Digital subs are huge profit margins. Game pass will eventually be a lot more per month

[3:16:31] VIIKON: @Towelliee what are the best tanks for raid and M+ atm?
[3:16:37] MoonwalkingAngel: nintendo is its own thing they dont count
[3:16:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Nintendo seems committed to their Switch stuff
[3:16:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: if xbox does pull out of consoles i shudder to think how much sony would charge for a PS6
[3:17:10] MrKray2: 84 years
[3:17:10] Rexy95: its not that hard to walk
[3:17:17] Turco11: xbox should just go to sony....be like you win console wars.....lets us put gamepass on your system....and you get to selll all the systems
[3:17:28] jarilrpg: @VIIKON BDK for raid, VDH for M+, prot pally second for both
[3:17:30] Curleaf: I always go through Astranaar, to Barrens, then to Rachet. There's a hole in the wall to the left of the horde station so you're not close
[3:17:37] KiLLMasTer20: I thank they will stop selling the S Series and just keep the X
[3:17:40] devildriver1919: xbox gonna just go into the pc market fuck the console market
[3:17:49] VIIKON: @jarilrpg thanks mate
[3:18:04] Sollice: @devildriver1919 Microsoft already sells tablets and laptops. They aren't going in to the PC market
[3:18:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they were saying that Playstation has been outselling Xbox 3-to-1
[3:18:21] Phant0mBass: 360 destroyed ps3
[3:18:28] Sollice: Some of you all have either wild ideas or don't know anything about PC markets lol
[3:18:54] SamuraiWillZ916: you running bfd on the horde?
[3:18:58] SamuraiWillZ916: today
[3:19:00] im_capy: and Wii U Kappa
[3:19:00] MoonwalkingAngel: i didnt like the ps3
[3:19:25] Molvonos: MAN, SPOUTING NONSENSE WITHOUT DOING DUE DILIGIGENCE AND RESEARCH.
[3:19:32] Niksen_99: Nintendo Wii Pog
[3:19:33] Molvonos: GOODNESS, WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED
[3:19:33] SinicalDev: X360 was more popular in the UK by far but PS4/5 is what most people I know have
[3:19:36] goosejamss: that is 100% eastern countries buying ps3

[3:20:07] Sollice: PS3 was slow to start sales because of the cell processer. It was completely unique and game devs had a hard time at first developing games. Once they understood and had time with it things took off
[3:20:10] CouchRanger: Sony dropped the PS5 inventory ball and 0 faith that anything else will not be different

[3:23:17] demonicyoshi: bring halo 5 to the MCC that would be the goat
[3:23:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, the biggest difference in consoles has been their exclusive titles with games
[3:23:24] Molvonos: Halo felt too floaty to me

[3:25:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can't really see those Playstation people just allowing all the Xbox content on their consoles, but maybe with a deal?
[3:25:20] Molvonos: @MoonwalkingAngel Because toxic shit needs to be dealt with instead of lauded.  Fuck that noise.
[3:25:21] MoonwalkingAngel: xD

[4:01:55] ClassicMalcontent: Esfand was doing it for the pvp tournament with the green screen interviewing and it was funny
[4:02:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: they probably will delay the pc version of gta 6 so they get people to buy it twice
[4:02:16] Curleaf: It feels like they're trying to take classic-era people and turn them towards retail.
[4:02:38] Lefty79: It could be that they "have a face for radio" ?

[4:08:40] valianya: They did some updates to vanilla graphics for flying and Cataclysm, and things like ground cover and trees were slightly improved, but most zones still look a lot like Classic zones
[4:09:21] ClassicMalcontent: I'd still like a Chromie timewalking option in Retail to see OG vanilla game world option
[4:09:35] Wcvechten: only actual somewhat changed areas is  the destroyed version of Tirisfal after BFA and Arathi in BFA
[4:09:42] Wcvechten: and Darkshore too I guess
[4:10:07] ClassicMalcontent: Even if they basically had to restrict flying in timewalking would be fine.
[4:10:11] im_capy: I soooo hope the leveling experience in retail is feels better with like follower dungeons and stuff in the future
[4:10:37] mabelyne_xo: how does that explain me being in teldrassil right now levelling
[4:10:39] FerociouzMonk: whut

[4:11:05] im_capy: Fire the big ass cannon finally, Goblins are kinda like money pirates
[4:11:18] devildriver1919: maybe we get to fire the azshara cannon
[4:11:19] reggiepowa: I think they meant sod players will be able to try event on retail with just the sub because it will be low level content

[4:11:45] spookaninja_21: “old god pirates” so Davey Jones from pirates of the Caribbean??
[4:11:46] EthicalHermit: I think it was a way for them to mass test the AI
[4:11:50] valianya: Only zones majorly updated were for Cata specific damage updates, Dark shore and Arathi for warfronts, the capital cities, Tirisfal after the battle, etc.  Things updated in retail events
[4:12:01] dustyzoose: is it just trash
[4:12:05] dustyzoose: ?
[4:12:24] Wcvechten: I did it to get some quests done and to see what it's about
[4:12:29] im_capy: Its super slow unless you tank and carry them fast
[4:12:32] sircheex: It got me to do real dungeons bc i got to try it when I had never done dungeons before
[4:12:33] ClassicMalcontent: I'm fine with it. Sometimes I want to not fly through a dungeon at max speed but enjoy it. So its not bad.
[4:12:34] Wcvechten: it's very geared towards actual new players and flavor imo
[4:12:35] jarilrpg: Follower dungeons is just for solo/new players
[4:12:39] valianya: I think they plan to expand Follower Dungeons to old expansions for better new player experience in Chromie Time
[4:12:43] raldrik: its great for going back and finishing off quests
[4:12:46] Wcvechten: Sneaky Pete as dps when tho
[4:12:55] Proxzo: Follower dungeons is for people who don't like LFG, since the people in there can be kinda harsh and judgemental.

[4:14:01] Proxzo: It is for healers, my partner doesn't do dungeons because they judge her even in normal. so the follower dungeons really help her actually play.
[4:14:08] jarilrpg: oh i have seen it, if someone doesnt know what to do, people leave
[4:14:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I got some of the AI killed in follower dungeons, I didn't notice any complaints LUL
[4:14:37] force_FMD: its a you problem when the followers in the follower dungeon kick you :D
[4:14:39] ClassicMalcontent: Everyone is in a hurry in a dungeon. Which is why the npc option is a nice break on occasion. I'll run in groups but its cool to have the npc and chill option.
[4:14:44] sinlesssinner: i need my AI to be toxic in dungeons bro, it aint wow otherwise :p
[4:15:05] Proxzo: Maybe it's when the rare toxic incident comes up, it really stands out and scares you off from doing dungeons.
[4:15:07] im_capy: yup, i take a shit and let them run it
[4:15:09] Wcvechten: Yeah, so follower dungos are for those folks
[4:15:22] Mallaes: lol
[4:15:30] EthicalHermit: Only time I have ever cared in a normal dungeon is if someone is afk for more than 50% of the run
[4:15:48] Wcvechten: I've seen people say they've never even touched a dungeon finder because they were so scared of it
[4:15:55] neftario105: @Towelliee Saturday is rips?
[4:16:13] valianya: New players in Chromie Time doing old expansions have to wait for hours for a dungeon queue to pop.  Follower Dungeons aren't meant for current expansion end game players
[4:16:29] Proxzo: Another function for follower dungeons is for people who don't do dungeons to finish story quests.

[4:17:03] Proxzo: yeah that's Brann
[4:17:20] valianya: Letting old expansions have Follower Dungeons to do for leveling story is going to be a godsend for players trying to experience old expansion content

[4:18:29] carmelchaos: Should just have lorewalker cho telling stories again imo
[4:18:46] Bakuryuha96: they drop a quest if killed
[4:18:56] valianya: Follower Dungeons also teach new players about the dungeon and mechanics
[4:18:59] jaseff693: thanks @Towelliee after last night talk about last epoch i am now addicted.
[4:19:02] ravenwingz0405: Burning crusade had some cool dungeons

[4:30:53] Jango_: cool, so a special set of rules for streamers.  but a normal person gets ganked for 3 hours and thats fine

[4:30:59] force_FMD: most times people will just quit ganking you after awhile, but a stream sniper could go on for days for views

[4:36:32] falldrgn: asmon is basically a rolling DDOS for a server.. anywhere he goes his army follows and just trucks the server
[4:36:39] Espartico: no, actually Final Fantasy
[4:36:42] 91Niki: The difference between stream snipers and plain out gankers is that stream sniping is as close to hacking without using hacks. It is an advantage beyond the games own capabilities. Take shooters, like BRs and Tarkov. A stream sniper might as well be using a wallhack. That is why the gaming companies take stream sniping serious.
[4:37:36] 91Niki: Does being ganked over and over suck? Yes absolutely. But the ganker isn't using a system beyond what is in the game to find you.
[4:37:42] Wcvechten: God I wish that were me
[4:37:51] force_FMD: cougar you say
