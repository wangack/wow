[0:06:29] oHodz: Messs
[0:11:53] omkar3108: PogChamp
[0:14:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:15:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP guardian druid, but these additional changes make quite a bit of sense
[0:15:50] krome2dadome: additional changes indeed
[0:15:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, a few more changes
[0:16:01] krome2dadome: druid in general
[0:16:05] krome2dadome: https://www.wowhead.com/news/additional-class-tuning-coming-tomorrow-pvp-tuning-337298?webhook
[0:16:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear form took a hit, it will affect all druid specs
[0:16:45] americanmoses18: so many classes shat on
[0:16:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Warrior is looking a lot better with this additional, too
[0:17:13] Taevenx: Ret/War inc
[0:17:22] tooch2: oh no!! there they go shitting on shamans again lmao
[0:17:35] nikthevoker: sup
[0:17:47] anmusallam: Did you see the new notes
[0:17:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: The warlock stuff....some say it is a net nerf, others a net buff... I don't know the math
[0:19:05] avenueone: hunter?
[0:19:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think a small armor buff for warlocks makes sense, apart from demo
[0:19:43] dubbfiend: you were right about the Monday changes :)
[0:19:46] avenueone: sod raids paused til p2 btw mes
[0:19:47] avenueone: hope its ok
[0:20:27] avenueone: yea remaining ppl need 1-2 pieces
[0:20:36] avenueone: but getting less n less every week
[0:20:39] wowsuomi: Back in the old days the buff for warlocks would of gone lived then been hotfixed a few weeks later
[0:21:21] nikthevoker: my war got nexted so got to find new raid
[0:21:21] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:21:45] Taevenx: I think it was hoped for but not really expected
[0:22:13] boltozor: your positivity is outrageous  . reported
[0:22:53] Vigi9413: so what you're saying is come tomorrow ditch the warrior and bring back the pally lol
[0:23:20] Vigi9413: the armor reduction seems nerfy i think
[0:23:52] Blaze150000: Yo mes. Changes activ now on na?
[0:23:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: D-stance is big, yeah
[0:24:43] dubbfiend: warrior safely A tier next week?
[0:24:58] notmes: 1370 -> 1390.55
[0:25:05] Seariphims: lol
[0:25:08] Seariphims: ^_^
[0:25:34] ZealotryTV: do any of these changes affect healing meta
[0:25:35] sbrees: Big buff to war!!!
[0:25:40] thrive_jp: is ret still gonna be good tomorrow
[0:25:46] healmeshammy: so the nerf to locks demon skin is big?
[0:26:12] Vigi9413: the fact that the ret changes apply to pvp is big
[0:26:30] Blaze150000: I thinkin about to play my ret again.. but then... noo wanna play dk
[0:26:40] notmes: 6188 current
[0:27:58] sbrees: 35% plus for cloth
[0:28:24] notmes: 4723 base * 1.35 = 6376
[0:28:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cool
[0:29:40] 인터넷포트: is plate uselesss after armor buffs or is plate still stronger
[0:30:57] Vigi9413: oh i didn't see they added the armored to the teeth buff
[0:31:01] Vigi9413: sweet
[0:31:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: That haste change makes the channel easier to use
[0:32:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: It should speed it up, so less time animation locked
[0:32:36] anmusallam: So it’s mage going to be tankier than lock
[0:32:42] anmusallam: Is mage***
[0:33:13] ZealotryTV: that legendary doesn’t actually exist
[0:33:26] Vigi9413: so does that put armored to the teeth at +str to 55% of armor in pvp?
[0:33:38] sbrees: 3 sec
[0:34:03] Vigi9413: was gonna lol
[0:34:28] anmusallam: Me sorry if I spam questions bro
[0:34:34] anmusallam: Mes
[0:34:36] disquared: !wa
[0:34:37] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[0:34:44] DBMezzy: no dh nerf, no devastation nerfs, blizz on cocaine or what
[0:35:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not exactly sure how that axe works in terms of that long range charge and attack, I would guess it charges first then goes into a sequence in melee range
[0:35:49] anmusallam: Is it ok if I still use the claw build next reset or is it in shambles forever
[0:36:05] Vigi9413: it's kinda weird they're lowering/raising armor adding health and making you sit CC longer. their way of helping with huge burst?
[0:37:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: The axe attack appears to start as a 3 second channel, once that part begins
[0:37:23] anmusallam: I think the longer cc makes it easier to burst
[0:37:37] anmusallam: Could be wrong
[0:38:30] DBMezzy: its cringe to see spec pressing 1 button doing most dam
[0:38:36] anmusallam: Dev is a one button spec and you can’t snare
[0:39:28] Vigi9413: you think the fury change changes whether fury is garbage in pvp
[0:39:30] anmusallam: It’s annoying when I can’t catch up and they’re immune to chains
[0:40:47] anmusallam: Idk why they nerfed Bear armor
[0:40:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomkins could really be feeling it with both an armor nerf to their regular moonkin form and the bear form
[0:40:57] anmusallam: I didn’t see it coming
[0:41:31] anmusallam: Resto will be easier to train
[0:41:31] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:42:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, resto druids and ferals are going to have a harder time tanking out damage, too
[0:42:49] anmusallam: Speaking of feral
[0:43:12] anmusallam: How do I survive their opener. I always lose against them in 2s
[0:43:23] anmusallam: Even when I press my ibf
[0:43:30] anmusallam: And shell
[0:43:37] Begasaur: evening
[0:43:53] Begasaur: not bad just gearing my priest, thursday
[0:44:15] Begasaur: got pushed back a little, but cant wait to geti t over with
[0:44:30] anmusallam: Get better soon
[0:45:26] Begasaur: idk understaffing etc

[0:46:03] sunileif: sup pagan lord mes
[0:46:07] sunileif: how you doing?
[0:46:19] Begasaur: trying to get a group for the raid on my priest, its hard at 435ilevel lol
[0:49:25] sunileif: got a destro lock to assist your leggo hunt next week rdy
[0:50:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: 5 heroic raids is awesome
[0:52:31] sober_toaster: <--fister
[0:55:57] americanmoses18: man fucking next week shud be my leggo....5 lesser fragments and one greater gotta be enough
[0:57:00] Flokko: im at like 8 greaters
[0:57:01] Flokko: no luck
[0:57:29] beski: what’s the cleanest opener for UDK look like?
[0:58:01] americanmoses18: idk 8 weeks of normal kills and 1 heroic kill and like 10 lessers should be a good shot by now
[0:58:15] kinetiq33: I am wrapping up mine right now, doing the 10 awakened every 5 minute part

[1:01:22] AxiomDK: doom: lower his health below 0 while keeping yours above 0.
[1:02:15] americanmoses18: honestly with my luck i expect to never get it lols
[1:02:15] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[1:02:24] dankNstein_: @chubxd i did raz and sark on 3 diff toons each difficulty every week for the mount skin and never got it from them
[1:02:29] chubxd: @americanmoses18 same
[1:02:51] sober_toaster: sorry had a bad rop on ur grip trying 2 stop a cast D:
[1:03:11] dankNstein_: i really like the orange fyrakk skin
[1:03:16] AxiomDK: Its like a 5% damage taken increase on tuesday for us right?
[1:03:21] AxiomDK: 10% damage reduction for cloth?
[1:03:31] sober_toaster: im kinda undergeared XD
[1:03:32] americanmoses18: the orange skin is cooler than the aotc skin for sure
[1:07:39] skidetko: do u think we go stoneskin tomorrow?
[1:08:02] skidetko: i heard we're dropping like flies in PTR
[1:08:14] skidetko: 6.5 with bond..
[1:08:22] skidetko: also armor
[1:08:27] Itankarenas: Any warlocks excited to lose 7% armor tomorrow? Sadge
[1:08:55] skidetko: oh alright ig i was lied to then
[1:09:05] Itankarenas: time to drop 4 piece and go for 7.5k vers again Sadge
[1:09:38] skidetko: 18%
[1:10:33] spoob37: !wa
[1:10:33] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[1:11:03] McLarge: That guy will be hitting you harder, but you're gonna have more HP
[1:11:06] ZallKlos: Jungle is 2x phy
[1:11:15] McLarge: But you'll also be hitting him slightly less hard
[1:11:54] skidetko: windwalker.. & bm hunter
[1:11:54] McLarge: Arms is pretty good, but I don't think it's insane
[1:12:52] McLarge: I don't expect the meta to shift much. Maybe Shadowplay will be more prevalent, but even then it won't be as insane as people were initially thinking with the changes from today
[1:13:26] Blaze150000: Leggo a must have for arena?
[1:13:47] americanmoses18: nope @blaze150000
[1:15:32] sober_toaster: war let me drink full lol
[1:15:33] americanmoses18: ezgame

[1:38:22] sober_toaster: dh's*
[1:43:48] krome2dadome: dude
[1:43:55] IamWalnuts: Mes xeek is playing some Frost DK / Moonkin / Pres and ripping people with it would love to see that with main team would be fun to watch atleast
[1:43:56] krome2dadome: i just played aff for the first time
[1:43:58] uninstallspeedrun: close game
[1:44:07] krome2dadome: was doing like 120k dps every game lol
[1:44:11] IamWalnuts: vortex beam on top of the opres frost dk goes

[1:48:18] krome2dadome: had a rlly good sesh today
[1:48:24] sober_toaster: so apperently its not a full imune XD
[1:48:41] krome2dadome: went 12-5 on alts and 11-4 on tsg
[1:49:08] ZallKlos: should i use verdant + infurious boots + 2x verdant as embellishment
[1:49:22] afriKENx: hey i called it
[1:49:44] afriKENx: warlock armor talent nerfed
[1:49:51] traav_p: have you played much frost?
[1:49:53] krome2dadome: there are little ways to increase it, but nothing worth enough to actually use
[1:50:10] krome2dadome: it’s like very little strength in the grand scheme of things
[1:50:45] uninstallspeedrun: is that big focus target cast bar a weakaura?
[1:50:47] sean_spelled_like_seen: sean_spelled_like_seen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Rip plate
[1:50:47] StreamElements: sean_spelled_like_seen just subscribed for 9 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[1:53:48] sober_toaster: sorry im undergeared lol
[1:54:52] traav_p: think the Stam buffs can offset the armor nerfs?
[1:55:24] sean_spelled_like_seen: I'm truthfully just worried playing plate into monks will feel pretty terrible. Not that I've been playing much plate this season, I've been rocking caster 😬
[1:56:45] krome2dadome: like ww? @sean_spelled_like_seen
[1:56:57] krome2dadome: cause ww is getting nerfed
[1:57:43] trollmasta66: yeah it's a good change for ww
[1:57:54] traav_p: you guys ever mess around with frost dk/ boomy/pres?
[1:57:55] krome2dadome: are those blackout kicks really less than 1%
[1:57:58] sean_spelled_like_seen: Yeah I didn't see anything that told me ww was going to realistically get nerfed at all
[1:58:02] trollmasta66: and karma is going to be stronger too
[1:58:04] AxiomDK: What do you think is the easiest comp for Unholy Glad this season?
[1:58:16] krome2dadome: swear blackout kick was like always 10%+ of my damage
[1:58:25] sean_spelled_like_seen: Most of the deaths my plate teammates have had are from big RSKs and such
[1:58:28] krome2dadome: but haven’t played it in a bit
[2:01:31] sober_toaster: i hate dh in 2's
[2:03:05] AkioneDK: Hey mes what do you think is better dot build or range build with the Patch?
[2:03:49] AkioneDK: mesS
[2:04:49] AkioneDK: HypeSanta
[2:06:53] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:07:14] sober_toaster: gg's ty!
[2:07:19] sober_toaster: sorry my gear sucks lol
[2:07:29] sober_toaster: i hit my gear threshhold i think lol
[2:08:00] sober_toaster: rusty on mw'er so hope it wasnt terrible lol
[2:08:00] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[2:09:17] sober_toaster: ty for the games!
[2:09:25] AkioneDK: Is the Patch already up on American server ?
[2:10:00] Yanzoh: Man, I can't wait for changes tomorrow, going to be awesome
[2:10:31] Kendakilla: I’m new to dk.. @notmes what’s best way to use globals to time maximum burst
[2:11:31] Yanzoh: Sweet dh dk games!
[2:23:02] wowsuomi: Bitcoin dropped to 39.4k earle today
[2:23:19] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:23:47] eMBeaR64oz: They should revert the change to hpal specifically
[2:23:50] eMBeaR64oz: thats kinda messed up XD
[2:25:58] Xenpp: !patchnotes
[2:26:11] Rainbowmes: someone got really high to come up with changes this stupid
[2:26:16] Rainbowmes: this is impressive
[2:26:25] Rainbowmes: to be this bad
[2:30:41] avenueone: why even have armor types tbh
[2:31:35] Rainbowmes: because they want to act clever like when they added all the pvp power changes but they are really too stupid to make it work dogeKek
[2:33:23] shugguls: erm did the accidentally buff my arms warrior with more str in pvp , I get a extra 3k str
[2:33:29] happyheals: I can understand the boost to cloth, but the reduction of plate  has no logic.
[2:33:58] Rainbowmes: there is no logic boosting cloth - when you can do your damage/healing from range it should come with the drawback of taking more damage if someone gets to you
[2:34:17] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[2:34:17] Rainbowmes: especially when cloth classes have so many abilities to kite with
[2:34:37] Rainbowmes: like a warlock doesnt need to be a tank when they only have to tank for 15 seconds between ports
[2:35:01] happyheals: only reason I say I understand it is the lower brackets dealing with rogue and dh quick kills
[2:35:08] shugguls: lock will be the same as now there nurfing demon skin
[2:35:19] Rainbowmes: well they are now
[2:35:27] artsskeit: except the war leaps or intercepts, dh flies, dk grips, ww xuens over
[2:35:29] Rainbowmes: the fact that they are so clueless they initially buffed them
[2:35:32] Rainbowmes: says all it needs to
[2:36:05] Rainbowmes: people doing changes are just completely clueless and throwing random things out
[2:36:06] happyheals: the patch without any armor changes would have been better lol
[2:36:07] shugguls: I mean arms is getting buffed , I’m happy with these changes 😂
[2:36:13] artsskeit: its all about mobility and ability creep.  theyre trying to address that but instead of reverting things they just keep adding other shit on top of it
[2:36:34] Rainbowmes: yea because they dont actually know what they are doing in the first place
[2:37:10] artsskeit: bring back.. i dunno
[2:37:13] artsskeit: ghostcrawler!
[2:37:22] Yukimes: no nerf to chill streak is weird
[2:37:35] Rainbowmes: they just need to get rid of some buttons tbh
[2:37:38] Rainbowmes: that would be a good start
[2:37:50] Rainbowmes: they just keep adding stuff and they havent even balanced the previous stuff
[2:38:12] happyheals: just need a seasonal arena affix where every 30 seconds there is a pulse that breaks stealth and prevents restealth for 5 seconds
[2:39:08] shugguls: remove the ability to restealth and drink
[2:39:09] artsskeit: the biggest surprise the lack of hunter/hunter pet nerfs.  just in case sod hunters wanted to be hunters in retail, gotta keep beating down on them
[2:40:38] Thorgood2: gday mes
[2:41:39] happyheals: If a Rogue stealths for more than 20 seconds, it dies painfully
[2:41:49] happyheals: fair affix
[2:42:50] artsskeit: ELE LIVE LORD
[2:43:16] artsskeit: ok not that time
[2:43:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tough fight, nice
[2:46:45] Thorgood2: big win

[2:46:50] Thorgood2: CoolCat
[2:47:58] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:48:03] Thorgood2: how do u think arena will be after the changes? anything u think will change or just make rogue mage stronger
[2:50:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pikaboo seems to think that sub rogue is done, with the changes, but I'm not sure
[2:52:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think there is a chance of RMP coming back, also ret+war, but I have no idea what's going to end up being strongest
[2:53:19] Devcomz: @wEiRdO_dUdE For the tourny it probably is everyone saying outlaw is the best after changes tomorrow
[2:53:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: In theory it could be something crazy like cupid cleave with ret and hunter, that rocks out
[2:53:52] atoker: idk why ret dh isn't a thing, you would think that they synergize with the dh magic debuff
[2:54:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I could believe it if outlaw is the play for that, I remember back in Shadowlands I think when everyone was using it
[3:00:17] happyheals: have you guys tried rdruid or pally with this?

[3:07:46] avenueone: 7.5 p sure?
[3:10:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: "With next week’s reset, the Conquest cap will be removed. In addition, Spoils of War will become active, providing increases to Conquest and Honor earned."
[3:11:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't heard anything specifically about boxes, I would guess they are possible but who knows
[3:12:05] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:12:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it was last season that Supatease had to bug them on Twitter before they added the boxes, around this point
[3:12:21] Yukimes: cdew needs to take a break
[3:12:42] wowsuomi: I Dare you to say drink some water chuck
[3:20:23] Ritzie: for someone brand new to dragonflight solo shuffle and dk, would you recommend learning disease build, or going clawing?
[3:20:40] Bersolgens: just 2 sharp glads next to each other
[3:24:08] HashTagRNG: How's an eviscerate nerf going to kill a spec? I mean they going to cry cause can't 1v2 and one shot
[3:24:12] Yoshi_Joshima: What the
[3:24:28] shugguls: what was that
[3:25:51] eMBeaR64oz: trill and cdew kinda bored/down or sick?
[3:25:54] eMBeaR64oz: energy seemed low
[3:26:19] one_true_goose: Are DK gonna struggle with the armor nerfs ?
[3:26:22] atoker: cdew has kids so he's tired for sure
[3:26:42] overrrlord12: Naw. No way
[3:26:48] rdmr13: Cdew no heal
[3:26:48] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:26:52] Ratkingdomdh: i think trill has time to blur between that first cheap
[3:27:07] overrrlord12: Trinket nether. Had to be faster. ..
[3:27:41] happyheals: what rating will I stop seeing dps arguing with each other and afking matches? They keep ruining my 6-0s
[3:27:44] atoker: @Ratkingdomdh you have to trinket nether the 2nd cheap or you die in the 3rd
[3:27:48] happyheals: in solo shuffle
[3:27:55] cdewx: 816 raiders from cdewx have joined! 
[3:27:55] StreamElements: cdewx just raided the channel with 816 viewers PogChamp
[3:28:04] overrrlord12: Ya tru
[3:28:19] uninstallspeedrun: @happyheals unfortunately never, alot of pvp players have mental health issues
[3:28:29] overrrlord12: Grip they just ztep back
[3:28:53] eMBeaR64oz: na
[3:28:58] eMBeaR64oz: they have step, hook and that rush thing
[3:29:01] eMBeaR64oz: just 1 step
[3:29:04] TheSingleBest: It has three movement abilities
[3:29:13] TheSingleBest: shadowstep, hook, blade rush
[3:29:14] happyheals: It is sad, they start in on the first match. Like I remember you freom 13 games ago, you missed a kick. Im afk this round lol
[3:29:16] eMBeaR64oz: hook gets cdr like evasion and such
[3:29:26] overrrlord12: Blade rush is like a charge. Tru
[3:30:44] TheSingleBest: outlaw rogue damage is a slot machine for 6 seconds out of stealth. They have a 25% chance to repeatedly get 5 combo points on the between the eyes. The rogue probably just got lucky
[3:31:17] happyheals: Yeah, they should lower plate armor by like 30% to counter that damage
[3:31:21] TheSingleBest: yeah or dance
[3:31:28] ImHomegr0wn: ghostly strike windows too
[3:31:30] healhut: vanish or dance yeah
[3:31:37] eMBeaR64oz: They can spam between the eyes most the time when vanishing and dance
[3:31:59] eMBeaR64oz: chance to get 5 combo points and no CD on between the eye which dispatches from stealth
[3:32:07] eMBeaR64oz: so they basically do double finishers for alil
[3:32:11] petkicklol: swear if he gets sapped or w/e blind is the play
[3:32:39] TheSingleBest: Yeah they will do most of their damage out of stealth. To be honest outlaw damage is kind of low outside of procs and stealth
[3:32:51] TheSingleBest: its the ele shaman of melee
[3:33:17] TheSingleBest: most of the burst will come from dance or vanish but they can get ambush procs for 3x ambush
[3:33:24] eMBeaR64oz: here sec mes ill linmkm
[3:33:24] TheSingleBest: outside of the window
[3:33:26] eMBeaR64oz: link*
[3:33:49] eMBeaR64oz: ambush can proc randomly with out stealth
[3:34:28] TheSingleBest: he probably coulnt get goes off with vanish or dance
[3:34:38] TheSingleBest: between the eyes has long cd if you dont use from stealth
[3:35:00] eMBeaR64oz: dispatch is the main finisher
[3:35:12] eMBeaR64oz: between the eyes adds a dispatch onto it from "stealth"
[3:35:15] TheSingleBest: between the eyes crits for 4x damage
[3:35:19] TheSingleBest: its just no cd from stealth
[3:35:21] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:35:21] eMBeaR64oz: so a few sec after vanish and dance
[3:35:28] TheSingleBest: no cd when between the eyes is used from stealth
[3:35:42] TheSingleBest: and has slot machine to grant 5 combo points so you can just use it again immediately
[3:35:51] TheSingleBest: so it chains 100k 100k 100k

[3:36:10] StreamElements: juiceboxxx23 just subscribed for 10 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[3:36:55] TheSingleBest: you can't disarm between the eyes either but if they dont proc slot machine the disarm prevents them from generating combo points effectively
[3:39:46] eMBeaR64oz: I linked you another one
[3:39:49] TheSingleBest: There is also a roll the bones buff that basically guarantees the 4x damage on between the eyes (makes it always crit)
[3:39:50] eMBeaR64oz: for between the eyes
[3:40:25] TheSingleBest: There are two builds
[3:40:33] TheSingleBest: there is a dispatch build which is more consistent damage but no burst
[3:40:42] TheSingleBest: most rogues play the between the eyes
[3:44:39] hitstar98: payoCc
[3:46:20] atoker: so I guess you spec into all the roll the bones talents to proc more buffs more often right?
[3:46:36] eMBeaR64oz: down for whatever you need
[3:47:01] TheSingleBest: yeah it procs
[3:47:01] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:47:14] TheSingleBest: decently often if lucky
[3:47:24] TheSingleBest: but doesnt hit for as hard as between the eyes
[3:47:58] juicerjaw: do u think ret will be strong tomorrow ?
[3:48:01] DizziestShot: during dance he just spams between the eyes unless he needs to build combo points with ambush
[3:48:15] DizziestShot: but you can get procs where between the eyes will refund combo points
[3:48:30] atoker: man doing tarolekk today was fun with the sparks quest and all, best 26k gold I've ever earned

[3:56:45] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:57:13] simszszy: PogChamp
[3:57:58] atoker: dhs can solo shaman
[3:58:33] atoker: a dh with 2 piece and greens can wreck my shaman as enhance or ele in shuffle
[3:58:43] atoker: and my sham is 489
[3:58:49] danielbanks: Does taking the fist weapon over glaive as a dh matter ?
[3:59:08] icyyyspicyyy: i dont even run 4piece on my dh
[3:59:41] icyyyspicyyy: @danielbanks currently with 1 glaive , 1 fist wep.. they both have same stat
[4:00:05] icyyyspicyyy: just diff base dmg, but only slightly
[4:00:33] danielbanks: Yeah was wondering if that base damage makes any difference lol
[4:00:36] danielbanks: Thanks
[4:01:00] atoker: it does, but you'd have to calculate the average
[4:01:35] icyyyspicyyy: its probably a 300dmg difference, but with dh output its not noticeable
[4:02:48] al_capow: jello
[4:08:52] al_capow: just checked out palworld a bit
[4:08:52] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[4:08:56] al_capow: its actually pretty fun
[4:09:28] al_capow: the design isnt something I super love, but the gameplay is actually really solid feeling
[4:09:49] sunileif: ya lets hope its ai based so i cnan be out of work!
[4:10:38] sunileif: i mena if anything you always need a human eye to go back over
[4:10:49] al_capow: there's also a lot of really interesting non-ai but still programatic innovation for game design
[4:11:01] sunileif: if youre a professional you can tell the autogenerated thigns
[4:11:18] al_capow: like wave function collapse for tileset mapping, and cellular automota for world events/interaction design
[4:11:43] sunileif: automated world events sounds liek a nightmare
[4:12:31] al_capow: not necessarily, sometimes it can be intuitive, like if they're based on weather patterns for example
[4:13:27] sunileif: oh im just thinking if its bugged the ai will think its fine
[4:14:09] Shxcky: ele just seems like straight lava burst now lol kinda sick
[4:14:13] Shxcky: seems fun
[4:14:23] sunileif: i get what youre saying mes about more exspansion but think of it from bobby kotiks point of veiw... now he can spend less on drones and rake in more profit
[4:14:42] subnev: hey mes excited for the tourney
[4:15:07] sunileif: i had the job where i fised the autogenerated models
[4:15:12] sunileif: its soul crushing
[4:18:52] VakuXGodX: How dk nerf? Any new build /
[4:18:55] VakuXGodX: ?
[4:19:38] GLYFEnation: Faster production. More games. More human staff to manage them.
[4:19:47] sunileif: BG3 was amazing and that was a smaller company
[4:20:03] sunileif: and other triple A studios immediatly shit on it
[4:20:25] sunileif: altho i wish i could make a game by myself
[4:20:33] sunileif: then again motivation <,<

[5:00:43] al_capow: alright here's a WA that I can't test bc my arena rating is high enough so it might work, might do nothing, or might break everything and cost a game lol  https://wago.io/WRWoVKwDg
[5:00:54] al_capow: isn't high enough**
[5:01:58] ggpyroboy: the plate armor nerf coming tomorrow do you happen do you know what percentage of physical damage reduction that ends up comes out to? I’m not at home I would check lol
[5:02:04] dawsonator171: probably gonna let my sub expire and re-up for war within.

[5:19:43] al_capow: I swear wow would be so much better if they let brand new players join rated arena
[5:19:47] al_capow: like have an ilvl bracket
[5:20:18] al_capow: what are the frames in the bottom right when you play?
[5:20:21] al_capow: are those the real frames?
[5:20:30] happyheals: you would just have players farming those brackets for w/e reason
[5:20:44] al_capow: those should have highlighted tho if the code was right
[5:20:57] al_capow: nah
[5:21:22] al_capow: oh interesting

[5:34:16] dawsonator171: 4 seconds huge armor increase.
[5:34:22] happyheals: right of it
[5:34:24] afriKENx: @Yoskexz they are deleting hunters from the game
[5:34:48] dawsonator171: fuck all hunters and hunter players.
[5:34:57] happyheals: that gives you armorwhen you shift
[5:34:59] Yoskexz: @Yoskexz  PepePls
[5:36:11] happyheals: When I get targeted and using ironfur it is like mid 20s

[5:37:41] Troniiicz: what will be a good comp with ele sham to push glad tomorrow
[5:37:45] happyheals: warr changes were non pvp
[5:37:56] atoker: warriors won't be doing much in the awc
[5:38:21] krome2dadome: nerf warr :nodders:
[5:38:26] dawsonator171: I think fury will make an appearance in AWC.
[5:38:40] atoker: could you guys try ret dh or ret ww next week? so we can see
[5:38:41] happyheals: in a teams last match before being eliminated

[5:41:43] atoker: yeah they have it
[5:41:44] tastyqueef: is there a way to edit buffs/debuffs shown on nameplates on your plater profile? i cant seem to find it
[5:41:53] happyheals: oh I just haven't played it since like s2 slands
[5:41:55] dawsonator171: I actually think blizo will make an appearance on warrior, almost guaranteed.
[5:42:10] krome2dadome: why would he ever warrior when he can dh
[5:42:20] happyheals: dh is too good to play warr
[5:42:20] marbas001: think theres ever a nutty deathwish fury reverse sweep
[5:42:34] atoker: against good teams that are communicating will result in the stacks getting dropped
[5:42:47] Solushun: ret/dh :)
[5:42:57] Solushun: the new ret war
[5:43:03] krome2dadome: @Solushun VoteYea
[5:43:04] atoker: oh man I can't wait to see ret dh
[5:43:32] dawsonator171: did you finish that heroic last night?
[5:43:39] happyheals: It would be so cool to actually see warriors play in awc
[5:44:41] atoker: @happyheals they can't succeed with the skill level of the sub rogue players in the awc in NA
[5:44:46] stockbridge10: gl
[5:45:04] NomFries: fake queue
[5:45:09] serratedlove: just kill fyrakk on mythic for highest chance 4Head

[5:45:53] NomFries: rebaited
[5:46:06] atoker: afk dps
[5:46:07] NomFries: LUL
[5:46:15] dawsonator171: only takes 1 heroic fyrakk kill to get leggo mes.
[5:46:27] atoker: a healer has lost his resolve

[5:53:59] afriKENx: sad my healer quit
[5:54:09] joketahiti: hello

[6:06:51] eMBeaR64oz: awc gonna be littered with rogues
[6:07:41] goatskull123: when was awc?
[6:07:54] krome2dadome: it's in a week
[6:08:11] kitsoupne: if cheap shot didnt give a combo point they couldnt cheap shot evis with blades monkaHmm
[6:08:14] InkdAdam: dk be after tomorrow? I’m happy to play disc but locks seem like they’ll be crazy strong and ret too
[6:08:26] dawsonator171: true story, you can immune some ccs with legendary on use.
[6:08:43] dawsonator171: kidney clone
[6:08:46] dawsonator171: blind
[6:08:50] dawsonator171: not cheap for some reason.
[6:09:38] deno65: Changes are big? Feeling way different?
[6:10:08] dawsonator171: only works when it's doing its charge animation. if you get cc'd while channeling, the cast always goes through and does damage.
[6:11:15] NomFries: what is that secret technique warning
[6:11:33] kitsoupne: these rogues pushing before reset nerfs KEKW

[6:28:44] kitsoupne: um ackshually it's 2/3 because war stuns go through evasion too 🤓
[6:28:56] happyheals: man imagine losing part of your immunity while chain ccing someone. oof
[6:29:05] happyheals: should just vanish

[7:06:40] Delxenyo: @Landrysdad with mm?
[7:06:57] quitoxo: just started gearing my dk, whats more valuable to dump conq into? weapon or the tier peices
[7:10:58] coldgrayrain: he really wanted his pet
[7:18:25] happyheals: lol 4 solo queues. 2 no game draws, 1 first game leaver, and a 3rd game leaver
[7:19:26] happyheals: just funny, it is for dps so the queues are long
[7:19:59] atoker: @happyheals oh if you're healing it's no biggie... dps go back to waiting
[7:21:05] happyheals: I was dpsing them
[7:21:35] happyheals: started at 0 rating. In 2 hours I am 319 rating with only 2 rounds lost haha
[7:21:46] happyheals: I see why dps get upset
[7:21:53] happyheals: Im going back to healing haha
[7:22:17] atoker: @happyheals then that's awful I'm sorry...
[7:22:41] happyheals: It isn't main spec or anything, so I'm not upset. Just find it amusing
[7:22:47] atoker: @happyheals hopefully you can meet people to do 3s somehow
[7:23:33] atoker: @happyheals you could farm 3s rating as a healer, and that could get you into more groups when you want to dps
[7:23:33] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[7:24:04] happyheals: Im over 2k in 2s as a healer. I am just messing around with boomy
[7:24:14] atoker: 3s rating in infinitely more valuable than shuffle rating
[7:24:22] atoker: is*
[7:24:49] happyheals: I haven't queued a 3s game since season 2 slands
[7:26:04] atoker: I'm wondering if the talents that give more mastery harmony stacks on lifebloom are better than tree form for healing
[7:27:29] happyheals: you should always have harmonious blooming in every spec variation for healing
[7:28:04] happyheals: or do you mean budding leaves?
[7:32:49] atoker: @happyheals let me check my druid 1 sec
[7:34:01] atoker: budding AND harmonious, I'm running those now over incarn
[7:35:01] atoker: I can't drop the 2 in regenesis or people WILL die in my tranq
[7:37:06] bishopworldtv: @notmes are starting for this awc?
[7:37:12] happyheals: I've seen some specs that run that. I've only been home and playing again for like 8 days so I am giving up reforestation and unbridled swarm for budding leaves in 2s
[7:38:27] happyheals: the on demand tree form gives too many benefits since I am not fully geared yet

[7:47:23] happyheals: Demon Skin increases armor by 22.5%/45% in PvP (was 45%/90%).
[7:47:31] happyheals: I didn't notice that before
[7:47:46] happyheals: in the patch tomorrow
[7:48:49] doomcute: any point to stack more versa after armor nerf?
[7:49:12] thunderstud25: they also counteracted the warrior dps impact from armor loss
[7:50:40] doomcute: why no armor nerfs for hunters
[7:50:55] SoraSkyforge: impressive how they didnt feel the need to nerf dh's dmg
[7:51:31] doomcute: @SoraSkyforge they didnt so u can reroll dh
[7:51:51] vitalbrahh: @doomcute hunter already dies in a stun
[7:52:12] ecofriend7: !addon
[7:52:20] doomcute: @vitalbrahh whats the point in having same armor as mail on plate class?
[7:52:32] happyheals: The best way to counter dh and rogue damage is by lowering plate armor to ensure less plate dps to deal with
[7:52:36] doomcute: like how do they explain it
[7:52:50] vitalbrahh: @doomcute ?
[7:53:32] TheRealEmvepe: You got r1 in OG season 8 ? Running which comp ?
[7:53:58] doomcute: cause of shield
[7:55:30] Szain3: DinoDance
[7:56:14] happyheals: Time for warrior cloth sets
[8:00:05] Kagestoes: OhMyDog OhMyDog
[8:02:24] honsou2: Wonder if the 5% healing nerf on Druid will make other healers able to play 2v2
[8:03:41] poppess: Can enh shaman win arenas this season?
[8:04:34] poppess: nice it my favorit spec

[8:06:24] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[8:06:49] Shablagoosh: I feel like the dragon flight ui overhaul was such a colossal failure. Just every single patch breaks the game, more reloads needed than ever, everyone already used their own uis anyways etc
[8:09:44] thunderstud25: I mean I got these UI errors plenty before but that was probably on fault of all the addons, now I have less addons and just as many errors lo
[8:09:53] Rustyz0r: Ooo frostmourne. Aussie represent. Hi @notmes from Australia!
[8:10:17] Shablagoosh: Yea I have a friend who uses zero addons and he still gets the ui getting bricked bug and has to reload sometimes like what lol
[8:10:36] Shablagoosh: Has to have been like an interns graduation project or something that’s just not fixable
[8:11:25] amniiiiii: where do you think DKs will sit after the patch?
[8:11:52] thunderstud25: I think that the change is directionally probably better in the long term with the game requiring potentially that much less in regards to addons
[8:12:08] Shablagoosh: did they confirm that those big ret buffs are for pvp as well?
[8:12:19] NaraliHS: Stamina buff is good vs casters
[8:12:52] Shablagoosh: just seems so crazy that they arent pve exclusive to me idk
[8:12:55] happyheals: I went down to 3 basic weak auras that just have a flashing icon in mythic plus and it still causes all abilities to become unusable and force reload
[8:12:56] Shablagoosh: im just a shitty duelist tho lol
[8:13:28] amniiiiii: better against casters in principle sure but will warlocks be killable in practice
[8:13:43] Yankee_ZuIu: yea DK is good but after 4 expansions but they’re already nerfing him 😅 and look at rogues broken sht since wotlk
[8:14:06] SebboTheFro: Whenever I see you in those shoulders I QQ that I didnt bother to get the scourgelord gear when it was available @notmes
[8:14:30] Rustyz0r: They nerfed their armor talent by 50% in pvp for warlock at least
[8:14:36] honsou2: Atleast DK is designed better than it has been in yeears. I think if we feel the nerfs it will be in shuffle, 2s and 3s should be okay
[8:15:15] happyheals: the changes just kind of force classes that were in the "unsure if going to be seen in awc" to "sorry you wasted your time gearing this toon"
[8:15:50] deno65: ill tell u, RMP and Locks will be good :D hahah
[8:16:07] deno65: mage aswell due armor thingys
[8:16:31] arediontv: @notmes you think warr/sp is good tomorrow ? (3s)
[8:16:47] happyheals: It didn't hurt me at all, just wanted to see some classes like warrior have a presence
[8:17:01] Yankee_ZuIu: My opinion is DK was good not OP it was good 🙂 before the nerfs
[8:17:07] honsou2: indirect buff to mage is nerf to clawing build LUL
[8:17:40] arediontv: @notmes is dk dead tomorrow ?
[8:17:49] happyheals: dk should be fine
[8:18:05] Rustyz0r: Dk is s tier the nerfs aren't gonna make it f tier lol
[8:18:06] Shablagoosh: I kinda miss playing my spriest so maybe the armor buff plus other stuff will help
[8:18:43] Yankee_ZuIu: yea :
[8:18:49] honsou2: dk is good until they nerf DH too lol
[8:19:00] happyheals: Gonna be fun if Jan 30th has rogue and dh nerfs
[8:19:52] honsou2: sub rogue already getting a decently sized nerf, is outlaw that op? i havent seen one in ages
[8:19:58] krome2dadome: @happyheals Prayge
[8:20:10] krome2dadome: @honsou2 yes
[8:20:30] Shablagoosh: outlaw does like 115k sustained dps the entire game lol
[8:20:34] Shablagoosh: its wild
[8:21:01] Yankee_ZuIu: Dk will be fine but you can see everytime DKs are good they are always get nerfed 🤣
[8:21:24] FACEX100: YEP
[8:22:07] doomcute: when was the last time dk or warrior won awc?
[8:22:34] honsou2: @Shablagoosh ah okay so theyre just sleeper OP for when sub is nerfed cause they still cant die
[8:22:36] Yankee_ZuIu: 1975 🤣
[8:24:36] honsou2: lmfao

[9:24:01] DirtyYankee0: apparation more for pve
[9:24:07] DeepxLogic: Wish they were more present in rbgs, thats for sure
[9:24:27] DeepxLogic: Boomie seems to have gotten a nerf
[9:24:33] DeepxLogic: Thats why I might swap
[9:24:35] DirtyYankee0: decent nerf aswell
[9:24:50] atoker: it's hard to get into rbgs as sp
[9:24:50] DirtyYankee0: yeah
[9:25:31] happyheals: 5% will prob just lower overhealing
[9:25:37] Solushun: im not trippin
[9:26:41] DirtyYankee0: Infernion did the math on warlock and it was like .3% more armor for warlock KEKW
[9:26:48] Solushun: im grateful 10.7 season 1 it made me not worry about nerfs LOL
[9:27:32] happyheals: the armor reduction will prob cause people to use master shapeshifter if they are being attacked, so you will get your mana regen there
[9:28:31] Solushun: if its retpocalypse again... Im going to not press anything if I get randomly HoJ'd and enemy teammate across the map. they wont get any buttons
[9:28:44] nerdyorc_: hey mes how you doing
[9:28:46] Solushun: if its higher rated one and they swapping on HoJ im going to have to use and will run out in 4-5 goes anyway
[9:29:13] nerdyorc_: retpocalypse was as much about rets being unkillable as it was about their dmg
[9:29:13] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[9:29:17] Solushun: was night and day between the good ret/wars during the ret/war/fistweave meta it almost felt like shadowlands rmp

[9:29:43] devascienos: RET DISC?
[9:29:46] DirtyYankee0: remove ret changes and instead buff their off healss
[9:29:46] devascienos: caps
[9:29:47] DirtyYankee0: pls
[9:29:50] americanmoses18: rdruid is the REAL problem here
[9:30:00] devascienos: ya
[9:30:03] devascienos: next patch
[9:30:19] devascienos: they have the damage tho
[9:30:27] yourKnightmaare: do you think the armor changes would be actually good if they only just buffed the cloth armor and kept plate the same?
[9:30:37] devascienos: 2 set  damage buff
[9:30:39] Applezbtw: rshams gonan do big burst i bet rsham ret will be nice
[9:30:42] happyheals: holy ret dh id holy is buffed enough
[9:30:47] happyheals: if
[9:31:06] DirtyYankee0: holy ret dh sounds cursed KEKW
[9:31:19] wowsuomi: Surely at least u get on one of ur toons
[9:31:45] happyheals: for fast gos the holy has a few things to avoid being attacked lol
[9:31:47] yourKnightmaare: the questing sucks
[9:31:50] yourKnightmaare: and it's expensive
[9:31:52] happyheals: my only idea on it
[9:32:01] wowsuomi: Can someone trade it if they get it
[9:32:18] yourKnightmaare: doing the superblooms is lame imo
[9:33:22] yourKnightmaare: what kb?
[9:33:33] wowsuomi: It would mean u could do slits to  get it
[9:33:51] Blaze150000: im very happy with the razer ornata
[9:34:30] yourKnightmaare: I built mine with linear switches 8008 switches
[9:35:01] plebcake_: hard to hear with music
[9:35:01] Loadedmvp: yeah
[9:35:04] Blaze150000: second is a bit louder
[9:35:05] devascienos: 1
[9:35:18] Loadedmvp: i mean i can hear both
[9:35:26] yourKnightmaare: I have an nk87 with 8008 switches lubed and filmed :)
[9:35:39] nerdyorc_: hmm I think 1 because in a long game the 2 will get annoying
[9:35:44] yourKnightmaare: its like 8 lbs
[9:35:46] yourKnightmaare: lol
[9:35:48] wowsuomi: My favorite is one thats louder
[9:36:08] freshdots321: Hey!
[9:36:11] yourKnightmaare: depends on your switch actually
[9:36:28] Sphexator: idk optical switches are pretty responsive
[9:36:43] Msv2: Whats good boiz
[9:36:46] yourKnightmaare: so you can have very responsive switches. which mine are. the only keyboard that is top tier when it comes to the competitive edge is anything from wooting
[9:37:06] josephzein: did u try dk after nerf?
[9:37:20] josephzein: isnt the update live?
[9:37:32] yourKnightmaare: nk87 can go up to 1000hz
[9:37:33] Sphexator: hmm, most PCBs I've seen is 1000 pooling
[9:37:34] atoker: @josephzein no
[9:38:00] josephzein: @atoker when is it? dont na get it today
[9:38:09] yourKnightmaare: mes, invest in a wooting keyboard
[9:38:17] atoker: 10am central standard time
[9:38:55] yourKnightmaare: I'm gonna save for the wooting 80he
[9:39:02] Szain3: DinoDance
[9:39:09] yourKnightmaare: Tenz has the wooting and stated it feels like it's cheating
[9:39:26] wowsuomi: So ur a better player now
[9:39:54] yourKnightmaare: you can customize your actuations per switch
[9:40:00] SammyLettuce: wooting makes really good stuff tbh. i got one for a rhythm game i play lol
[9:40:06] wowsuomi: Invet in foot peddles
[9:40:15] yourKnightmaare: no switch can go that low as the wooting
[9:40:15] wowsuomi: Invest*
[9:40:36] yourKnightmaare: yes
[9:41:10] stockbridge10: gl
[9:41:18] Msv2: Yeah there's got to be a fine line with accuations

[10:16:20] Tricepticon: lmao only way for me to move it is to adjust the size
[10:16:30] Tricepticon: some reason adjusting the size moves it on the screen maybe mines broken
[10:17:19] freshdots321: Mes My girlfriend correct me she said it doesnt proc in rated i am thinking of regular bgs sorry
[10:18:16] avenueone: whats going on here
[10:18:38] freshdots321: doing heroic first couple bosses for better chance at legendary weapon
[10:19:09] kklinker: yes
[10:19:15] avenueone: good
[10:19:16] kklinker: Good
[10:19:22] freshdots321: good
[10:19:29] the_audacity_x: its good but i dont like using it
[10:19:41] the_audacity_x: thats me personally tho
[10:19:55] kklinker: have it
[10:19:56] kklinker: using it
[10:20:01] kklinker: better than signet
[10:20:06] kklinker: when the bosses dont last long
[10:20:14] UltraKaos: good for st, just freedom urself, ez
[10:20:15] kklinker: You just use
[10:20:16] kklinker: and hit the boss
[10:20:51] the_audacity_x: you can still move just slowed
[10:21:47] Szain3: DinoDance
[10:23:39] avenueone: yea the slow on its pretty insignificant
[10:23:45] the_audacity_x: it lasts for 4 melee hits im ptetty sure
[10:24:34] rtcinema: talking about the rooting trinket?
[10:24:40] avenueone: i dont think u can freedom it
[10:24:43] rtcinema: It'sreally good for pve
[10:24:44] avenueone: but i only used the lfg version
[10:24:47] kklinker: i dont think you can freedom it either
[10:24:54] kklinker: but the slow is really not that bad with our range.
[10:24:56] kklinker: so... meh
[10:25:02] honeyloop: Hope ur doing well Mes
[10:25:10] rtcinema: My alt pally uses that trinket only cause my main doesn't have it yet
[10:25:29] rtcinema: My alt pally uses Augury+root
[10:25:36] rtcinema: main uses augury + vers trinket
[10:25:39] the_audacity_x: i just hate using it on smol and fyrak haha
[10:25:47] avenueone: mine uses signet/rezans
[10:25:47] kklinker: <3
[10:25:59] kklinker: I typcially use the above
[10:26:07] kklinker: but on quick boss kills signet is not great.
[10:26:51] yourKnightmaare: trying to hit 1800 on my warrior before it's impossible
[10:26:55] rtcinema: I banked signet. I mostly do m+ and the weekly heroic raid for axe. Doesn't feel really worth the effort to swap for the 1 hour clear
[10:26:58] avenueone: how long are servers down for
[10:27:06] yourKnightmaare: oh?
[10:27:20] snanikins: 1 hour

[11:04:26] Vendrek: I just saw the new additions to the class tuning...warrior just got a slight buff to damage.
[11:04:32] happyheals: I haven't done it since Prot arena in like 2008-2010
[11:04:38] Szain3: DinoDance
[11:05:03] heymomimonttv: @Vendrek no they didnt
[11:05:19] heymomimonttv: warriors armed to the teeth buff counters the plate armor debuff
[11:05:24] omkar3108: PogChamp
[11:05:36] Vendrek: I didn't say it was huge
[11:05:43] Vendrek: ye

[11:06:51] happyheals: congrats on plate being the new train target
[11:07:06] Vendrek: So as it stands I believe Resto Sham and Evokers have more armor than us?
[11:07:09] happyheals: it said after reset
[11:07:11] heymomimonttv: @Vendrek ahhh i see, my bad
[11:07:30] happyheals: oh my bad you meant drops
[11:07:32] DCBen: and if you use the ability and someone Bops Bubble Tranq immune
[11:07:35] DCBen: it cancels insta
[11:07:50] Vishnog: my bad
[11:07:53] healmeshammy: resto shammy got nerfed to armor as well
[11:07:54] Vishnog: Start Time: January 23, 10:00 a.m. PST (18:00 GMT)
[11:07:58] Vishnog: I'm dumb
[11:08:11] nikthevoker: sup
[11:08:14] rtcinema: Was there any warning about the armor changes in PVP? Why any have 4 armor types if they are just making everything leather/mail eq?
[11:08:21] heymomimonttv: ele getting armor nerf makes little to no sense to me
[11:08:42] LichbornHQ: non of the armor change makes sense :D
[11:09:08] healmeshammy: ^
[11:09:09] LichbornHQ: will be fun when warrior charge on you and oneshot :D or ww monk
[11:09:17] LichbornHQ: or mm hunter from stealth
[11:09:31] healmeshammy: warrior wont one shot anyone
[11:09:47] Vishnog: caster cleaves meta
[11:09:54] Vishnog: inc
[11:09:59] healmeshammy: ^
[11:10:08] heymomimonttv: warrior def not strong enough to 1 shot anyone but
[11:10:13] heymomimonttv: caster meta inc for sure
[11:10:23] heymomimonttv: cloth caster* or evoker
[11:10:31] healmeshammy: and cupid or ret/dh?
[11:10:54] happyheals: it already kinda felt like there would be a lot of caster comps
[11:10:59] sind233: Sensing some melee bias in the chat
[11:11:13] healmeshammy: melee bias?
[11:11:18] Vendrek: You are still going to see rogues, dhs, and monks...imo feral may come into the picture for jungle on warlocks but still think they need some love against melee themselves.
[11:12:18] sind233: Is caster meta casters being on equal footing with melee or superious? Cause they are barely playable before this reset
[11:12:39] sind233: superior]
[11:12:59] healmeshammy: real selection up prob servers on soon
[11:13:03] rtcinema: caster meta = melee don't steamroll them
[11:13:06] healmeshammy: realm
[11:13:17] sind233: @rtcinema LUL idd
[11:13:30] Vishnog: realmlist up but not active yet
[11:13:31] nikthevoker: i hate mornings
[11:13:57] Vishnog: how do I get moments badge?
[11:14:08] happyheals: caster meta round endings look like aoes on both sides of a pillar while the other team dies in a boring way
[11:14:08] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[11:14:27] rtcinema: @sind233 But in reality... caster meta = dampening usually. Like the old Cloud9 days of melee hiding behind a pillar because you're just dead if you poke out.
[11:14:39] healmeshammy: you think meta will shift somewhat @mes?
[11:15:24] happyheals: Blizz got people to level and gear melee dps, it was time to trim the fat
[11:15:30] healmeshammy: so we can see different comps on top of ladder beside 10 alts of petkick with mvq
[11:16:15] stockbridge10: oh Tuesday, fun times

[11:19:21] Vendrek: Frenzied Regen is going to be a lot better...if you take the 30% instant talent that is also going to go up.
[11:19:21] biofreaks: I want to know how many Blizz Devs work on pvp.. i want a numeber!

[12:08:03] rtcinema: Was wild
[12:08:04] krome2dadome: one day he’ll read my question Sadge
[12:08:05] shugguls: do we need a new prediction about if u will kill it rather  than if it drops?

[12:30:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: We go agane
[12:30:34] krome2dadome: @notmes did u see lego change and if so thoughts?
[12:30:36] SuperSunBros64: Is best way to do it first LFR > Normal > Heroic > Mythic because you get a greater ember from each???
[12:30:46] rtcinema: Do you have the other person's lockout again?
[12:30:55] Kriptonikz: that oce ping was rough for me holy
[12:30:56] rtcinema: Or did they burn their lockout on that kill?
[12:31:04] ZealotryTV: can i come on another semi geared hpal?

[12:31:26] Solastro: prayge i get into this group
[12:31:58] bollskis: @SuperSunBros64 doing highest level will use the rolls from lower levels
[12:32:01] krome2dadome: it’s gonna be a fast channel for warr
[12:32:18] bollskis: you can do it that way but u can also just do hardest difficulty
[12:32:19] krome2dadome: like 1.5 maybe
[12:32:38] SuperSunBros64: @bollskis Yeah I noticed that but isnt it still better to do LFR > Normal > Heroic > Mythic though because you get a greater ember from the lower difficulties that helps chance in higher ones
[12:32:51] SuperSunBros64: Cuz each one drops a greater ember
[12:32:53] krome2dadome: if u hit ur other head it will make ur noggin stop aching
[12:32:59] krome2dadome: @supersunbros64 no
[12:33:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the ret might be the one
[12:33:22] SuperSunBros64: How so? cuz u dont pop the greater ember in mythic until after the fight
[12:33:55] Chillinar: wdym fucked up
[12:34:00] krome2dadome: the embers don’t affect the current week’s drop chance @supersunbros64
[12:34:10] Chillinar: going for another try?
