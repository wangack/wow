[1:14:48] Brlskull: yep
[1:14:49] boopbopbamski: you gotta dedicate
[1:14:50] dirbagdan: i think people were also using it as a way to make gold for themselves rather than farming
[1:14:51] Betzypoo: buy dreamweave chest and gloves for your boomie
[1:14:54] oakenempire: one alt
[1:14:54] endraga1: unless your a mage

[1:15:36] Aumua: oh
[1:15:37] Brlskull: more xp if you have a 40 char maybe?
[1:15:38] kalsizzle2: do you think SOD pop has gone up or down since phase 2?
[1:15:39] Fakomi: some runes are not that easy to get. There's also things like the sleeping bag quest. Just a chore to do them on 3 characters.
[1:15:41] Aumua: cowardly alli
[1:15:41] Icecolddonut: @Raivan994 I had lots of fun getting dark knight rune

[1:16:28] arieltrindade91: Tips for a porn addict to stop?
[1:16:30] Sheldorisafk: maybe boast the sleeping bag by making it account wide w/xp boost
[1:16:32] NotTheWheel: sleeping bag? is it like TurtleWoW's tent? (increased rested exp rate?
[1:16:35] DankWizard420: honestly the bag itself should be account wide, it's 3%, if you want to do the questchain for the giga consumes go for it YEP
[1:16:40] OlympicUSA: @Icecolddonut Yeah like I have done over 1000 SM runs, its so bad, wish they'd boost exp
[1:16:46] Wellequipped: i have 4 sleeping bags, cost me 15g in 123s, 90 minutes and a little HS management

[2:28:54] dj_clerik: He's costing Twitch like 10 mil/year
[2:29:01] NotTheWheel: I disabled the sub button with ublocker was subbing to too many peoplee
[2:29:04] revora_: I'm banned in Payo chat. I've never seen ban notice before LUL I don't even follow him. I think someone in here is a snitch Stare

[2:29:06] EmanuShow: There we go no1 lets screenshot this for bragging rights :p
[2:29:14] l33to0: How does it truly benefit the streamer though? Wouldnt that discourage gifting?
[2:29:25] CookieClickerLegend: hob LUL
[2:29:32] death_fisted: Tax write off
[2:29:33] seymourmoney: it's also a tax rightoff?
[2:29:41] Lionkingler1: just use turkish prime bots BASED
[2:29:45] dj_clerik: can you write off that loss
[2:29:51] WubstepTTV: PAYO KEKW
[2:29:52] Sheldorisafk: I guess if you have enough money to waste, that sounds like it could be a short-term band-aid fix. A fake it to make it.
[2:29:52] Nytsongx: LIL P? KEKW
[2:29:57] tsetse2fly: @staysafetv best way to inflate subs was how trainwreck did it
[2:29:58] Sowiloo: payo
[2:30:04] unscconnor2: does the name rhyme with mayo?
[2:30:18] Mertauh: technically it only hurts them because they're losing money in the process of subbing to themselves
[2:30:22] batmern_: monkaHmm
[2:30:23] Faedrik: Notepad is known for its math abilities. :)
[2:30:28] Sowiloo: use turkey
[2:31:01] Lionkingler1: tax writeoff
[2:31:05] Faedrik: You pay $1.5 per sub.
[2:31:07] EmanuShow: My gifted are legit though chet Kapp
[2:31:22] Lionkingler1: lower the 1.50 by your marginal tax rate
[2:31:23] l33to0: So to my question, wouldnt that discourage gifting? or is it the thought of always chasing that top spot? or getting them to ressub?
[2:31:24] mattbarz989: gift subs harvesting
[2:31:26] allOvtheAbove: write me off
[2:31:41] Brenno_Mc: and you'd hope some of those gifted would resubscribe

[2:34:14] Lionkingler1: just padding the count. You just use turkish prime subs. Create accounts manually via vpn
[2:34:15] l33to0: Genuinely concerned, not sure if you responded in general because I had an add (sorry I didn't get a gifted) but to you as a streamer is there a benefit of doing what "said" streamer is doing?

[4:23:40] seymourmoney: It's honestly a great time to be playing wow
[4:23:45] SuchDomi: is it separate servers for ssf or same as normal hc?
[4:24:02] QuestFor420: its not for me
[4:24:03] regalbeast: zoneperson
[4:24:12] hussletrees: Joe Biden struggles with hardcore
[4:24:17] Rahncx: solo self found is DEFF not for everyone
[4:24:19] Jesselulz: @johnnyhopkinwead1 population data is based off logs, most people aren’t 40
[4:24:21] slachi: Can you complete any profession but alchemy in hcsf?
[4:24:25] regalbeast: HC is my fav version of classic wow
[4:24:27] thekillertwinkie: yea hardcore is definitely  not for me!
[4:24:30] osopolar1977: I’ll play with Igoggles soon
[4:24:30] avoidedneXt: non-ssf hardcore is kinda stupid
[4:24:35] thekillertwinkie: I make to many mistakes!
[4:24:40] johnnyhopkinwead1: @Jesselulz because nobody is excited to get to 40 to run gnomer lol
[4:24:44] OldBayKing: Starsurge, starfire, wrathx2, repeat, isnt the meta?
[4:24:46] AxelFromAustralia: i died at 19 warlock on hardcore and never tried again
[4:24:46] JoeBangles_: I beat hardcore, ez game
[4:24:48] huntingusa: Hated the idea of Hardcore, until I tried it out. Ended up loving it
[4:24:54] tw_30: what if they made the mats world drops
[4:24:57] hussletrees: That is so boring
[4:25:02] johnnyhopkinwead1: gnomer is a shit dungeon and a shit raid, too much trash, takes too long for a 3 day lockout
[4:25:14] RelaxExo: how’s the lootsystem work in ssf dungeons?
[4:25:14] sundebtw: @johnnyhopkinwead1 it takes less than an hour lmao
[4:25:18] hussletrees: exactly
[4:25:30] ItsHeroTime: what do you mean you cant lvl them?
[4:25:33] avoidedneXt: @RelaxExo need on everything
[4:25:34] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV do you think SoD is dying and if so why are people already bored?
[4:25:34] osopolar1977: expected more out of the Dungeons
[4:25:55] linkitcraig: what does alchemy need?
[4:25:55] slachi: maybe change the enchanting recipe so, say, copper rod + 2 silver bars gets you to silver rod. You can get bars from chests
[4:25:56] osopolar1977: I mean raids
[4:25:57] johnnyhopkinwead1: @sundebtw can we see your under 1 hour pug? including find ing your group and getting to the raid etc.
[4:26:02] PhokingTV_: so did gnomer reset today:?
[4:26:04] hussletrees: level it, bank it
[4:26:07] PhokingTV_: or is it in 3 days
[4:26:09] Rocksteady22: alchemy does not
[4:26:14] slachi: BS can't make arcanite rod solo
[4:26:31] speedzombie: Where tf yall going?
[4:26:31] tw_30: gnomer resets in like 12 hrs
[4:26:34] eddbighead3: this is some weird pathing
[4:26:35] osopolar1977: how many bosses in Gnomer
[4:26:36] slachi: and alchemy would need to be a miner
[4:26:41] slachi: to get the arcanite
[4:26:49] hussletrees: BASEDRETARD
[4:26:53] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV I also don't like how you are forced to do a profession for a BiS item
[4:26:55] sundebtw: @johnnyhopkinwead1 sure, check my logs, half guild half pug run, 1 shot every boss in 1hr 10mins, good groups will easily do under an hour
[4:27:02] iBanEvader: wish you could take more than 2 profs
[4:27:22] Somra: did you see the family guy stream in the wow section?
[4:27:23] hussletrees: HotPokket You arent hardcore
[4:27:24] therealfwizzle: just stockpile the mats EZ
[4:27:29] sundebtw: @sundebtw sunde - shadowstrike
[4:27:31] PhokingTV_: would be cool af if on hardcore self found you could have all professions
[4:27:35] MechanicalMelee: my guild just full cleared 🥳 <Salt> we had epic gun drop
[4:27:36] PhokingTV_: it would be like runescape
[4:27:38] slachi: nope, bs first
[4:27:39] iBanEvader: @PhokingTV_ truuue
[4:27:46] iBanEvader: @PhokingTV_ and we kinda need it on SoD also
[4:28:01] hussletrees: and then you become god of the server
[4:28:06] PhokingTV_: if u could have all professions for self found would make it so much more fun
[4:28:09] PhokingTV_: and interactive
[4:28:10] voreal22: and thats why SSF is bad
[4:28:13] helloiamlucas: what if they allowed more than 2 primary profs?
[4:28:16] nixter93: all while not dying
[4:28:27] iBanEvader: not only on self found
[4:28:28] Mythos_Chamber: "I found the mats myself"- at the vendor LUL
[4:28:32] iBanEvader: also on SoD
[4:28:42] iBanEvader: like 3-4 profs
[4:28:44] AxelFromAustralia: that would be insane having all the professions zoneman
[4:28:46] Bronloch: my bro does blacksmithing and leatherwork in his shop LUL
[4:28:50] thekillertwinkie: LOL
[4:28:51] Somra: bots would be absurd
[4:29:01] blackbmf: Or You can create and lvlvup few more twinks and lvlvup all those professions you need and get what you need wth those
[4:29:02] iBanEvader: @Somra why would it be absurd?
[4:29:02] PhokingTV_: in self found mode it doesnt really take from the game
[4:29:07] PhokingTV_: it just adds to the challenge
[4:29:15] hussletrees: fun detected HotPokket VoteNay
[4:29:20] johnnyhopkinwead1: @johnnyhopkinwead1 you contribute a considerate amount of your time to do well in this game, most casual pugs do not do this
[4:29:32] avoidedneXt: i hoping all of their work is going into phase 3/4
[4:29:37] iBanEvader: everyone who wants to compete has to take engineering and leatherworking/tailoring
[4:29:44] 5by_five: @blackbmf wont be able to on SSF
[4:29:50] Somra: @Somra because you already get enchanting bots, can you imagine what people would charge if bots could have access to 4 professions at a time
[4:29:50] KingQueenAce: true
[4:29:51] yuckil: its fun playing other classes imo
[4:29:52] sundebtw: @johnnyhopkinwead1 thats not wrong
[4:29:52] iBanEvader: agree so much
[4:29:53] slachi: Just make an offline wow mode
[4:29:54] KingQueenAce: would save so much time
[4:29:59] JoeBangles_: so.... FF14
[4:30:02] iBanEvader: I never liked the prof limit on WoW
[4:30:04] Slyz777: albion online
[4:30:06] latenightsuckmeright: nah roles are so much better
[4:30:12] PhokingTV_: basicly new world
[4:30:12] CygnusC: the way it is is to stimulate player interaction and economy
[4:30:17] karsy239: ff14
[4:30:20] c0gnusTV: on ff14 even though you can be any class you are still stuck to 1 raid lockout
[4:30:36] Somra: FF14 is made with that flexible mindset, they know they can't please everyone when they design the jobs
[4:30:45] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV the initial idea of only 2 professions was to make you dependant on others and increase social interaction
[4:30:47] PhokingTV_: love the new world aspect of crafting
[4:30:47] Sowiloo: the problem is the degenerates in ff
[4:30:48] iBanEvader: those times are long gone
[4:30:49] palanim_: Good Morning mein Freund (6:44 AM in Germany)
[4:30:50] slachi: I noped out from the weird moogles

[4:30:55] PhokingTV_: in new world u can go as DEGEN as u want
[4:30:59] warios1981: Druids can do it all
[4:31:08] eddbighead3: think they kill this boss?
[4:31:08] Somra: @StaysafeTV are you a FF fan at all?
[4:31:09] Camrock__: MR LEBOWSKI
[4:31:13] eddbighead3: 1 shot or? how many?
[4:31:23] JoeBangles_: @PhokingTV_ I loved running around picking hemp in new world lol
[4:31:31] Somra: explains a lot trickyyNodders FF14 won't be your thing
[4:31:32] iBanEvader: I tried ff14 but always get bored
[4:31:39] eddbighead3: lol in runescape i use to make magic longbows and alch them, thought i was the shit

[4:31:58] MawblesPDX: king of the hill is the best anime ever made
[4:32:02] thekillertwinkie: It always had an over the top element to it
[4:32:03] iBanEvader: castlevania is cool
[4:32:04] sainttv92: if we didnt drop the bomb i dont think anime would exist
[4:32:04] Toffekotten: how much spellpower you got bro?

[4:32:05] Somra: boomkin is cringe till they get starfall
[4:32:06] iBanEvader: would you consider that anime?
[4:32:08] slachi: I liked dragon warrior/quest more than ff
[4:32:09] osopolar1977: wut
[4:32:15] PhokingTV_: classmates ruined DBZ for me
[4:32:18] PhokingTV_: KEKW
[4:32:21] osopolar1977: kekw
[4:32:22] PhokingTV_: never tried again after that
[4:32:29] praxeoum: @StaysafeTV do you ever do true warrior adventure rp with your followers?
[4:32:32] avoidedneXt: castlevania is not good
