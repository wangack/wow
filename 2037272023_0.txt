[0:55:18] Clern: it had a similar item id to the item he was trying to get I think
[0:55:18] Diddly_dope: prob meant 1 charge
[0:55:21] Aevalous: I doubt GMs have items. They don't need to kills stuff.
[0:55:23] itsmoxie: It was something to do with item ID

[2:01:13] YermGames: @Xaryu serious question. i quit retail wow at cata, do you think trying the new expansion saga is gonna be worth trying form a classic andy?
[2:01:18] tuna_sandw1ch: whats up you nerds
[2:01:24] GrishnerF: Art imitates Life imitates Art.
[2:01:26] xDeathzDezignx: yep
[2:01:27] thrushmaster69: world of Warcraft is becoming less Warcrafty every expansion
[2:01:28] Thays182: AT LEAST PALWORLD IS FRESH!
[2:01:30] j03seph: it is kinda funny it was also a dragon game tho lol
[2:01:37] morat_g: Remember when all new mmos were called wow clones?
[2:01:43] MartianPK: retails ruined
[2:01:44] yhannto: aye you got the turtle back!
[2:01:53] Fewis_: that flying game is just not it for me
[2:01:55] Towenaar2: Sadge
[2:02:02] miasmile: i rly like them having 2 versions with classic and retail
[2:02:06] Towenaar2: COPIUM
[2:02:11] VitoBambino: idk how people can say that when you can log in to Dragonflight and just immediately jump in to whatever content you want whether it's arena, M+, raid, whatever
[2:02:12] gmar_07: the gear progression in retail is trash
[2:02:15] fishm0nger_: we need warcraft 2 lore but as wow
[2:02:17] Alerothan: They literally gave all you retail haters 3 versions of classic. Stop complaining about RETAIL BADDD!!!
[2:02:19] DAISHI__: would be dumb if after 20 years the game didnt change at all
[2:02:21] aciddkng: world of warcraft is not the same and they know it thats why they make sod
[2:02:21] reallyeric: for anyone to think the game is gonna stay the same for 20 eyars is crazy
[2:02:22] adamanttv101: wow isnt for us anymore is for younger players @Xaryu
[2:02:27] TheKraken2024: I am never playing 'retail' again
[2:02:30] xDeathzDezignx: I have been playing since vanilla
[2:02:30] VitoBambino: if anything it's easier to jump into content in DF than in any other expansion
[2:02:32] dhali1985: vanilla wow foundation + some solid changes.. that's the dream
[2:02:32] xQ_Qx: we ready for death today @xaryu

[2:02:57] bestfacecheck: yes
[2:02:58] Deomas11: Yes I would definitely try it!
[2:03:01] clemensb14: yes
[2:03:03] nooblordxd: wow 2 is such a broad idea that its hard to give an answer, like what would it be and how would it feel diff then wow 1
[2:03:03] BujuArena: warcraft 2 came out in the 90s
[2:03:03] NekoTheSpook010: Sod > wow2
[2:03:04] iamTBird: if i wanted to play classic story before going to wrath servers and playing tbc, wrath, and later classic, purely for story, how do i go about finding some story in classic?
[2:03:04] rejuzi: +
[2:03:04] aciddkng: no wow classic is where it is
[2:03:05] Zer0Dystopia: probably they will make it after the new trilogy
[2:03:05] adamanttv101: only if it was like osrs style
[2:03:05] reallyeric: warcraft 2? thats a lready a game
[2:03:06] zerozuckerl: what does it even mean?
[2:03:07] fishm0nger_: i meant warcraft 2 like the RTS
[2:03:07] sheepown: blizz cant create anything good so they’re packaging what is essentially a different game as wow so ppl are duped and buy it
[2:03:08] zerozuckerl: warcraft 2
[2:03:10] YermGames: serious question. i quit retail wow at cata, do you think trying the new expansion saga is gonna be worth trying form a classic andy? @Xaryu
[2:03:11] kyuul55: classic rs you mean?
[2:03:11] j03seph: they won’t make it right tho but if they did I would lol has to be top down rp design
[2:03:11] reallyeric: you mean world of warcraft 2?
[2:03:13] weedah: heavily depends
[2:03:15] Jmens315: but thats because the new version of runescape is nothing like the old. its TOO different.
[2:03:16] Mavzerick: Classic+ aka SOD is the best version of wow once its fully realized and has permanent servers
[2:03:18] combobreaker11: wow 2 if it kept the classic feel
[2:03:24] andrewjardine18: Xar the hair is getting a little too majestic to handle
[2:03:24] grebby71: I feel like the memory game in Ogrila in TBC was the beginning of a slippery slope for WoW that led to pet battles and dragon racing and all the things that make retail bad
[2:03:26] timmyclemons: I still enjoy retail. my biggest issue is they can NEVER figure out how to balance classes. PvP is just a bunch of rdruids and disc priests. wish every class was viable
[2:03:29] thrushmaster69: Classic wow in the unreal engine
[2:03:31] Paelleon: To be fair, Cataclysm was WoW2
[2:03:32] phunkmastaflex: whats ur favorite xpack arena wise?
[2:03:32] TheKingOfKingz2109: No way to play WoW 2 if I lose my spectral tiger etc
[2:03:38] aciddkng: 50 fishing
[2:03:42] jeneraljelly: need a lure
[2:03:44] weedah: would need a "wow factor" to pull people away
[2:03:45] BlackRe3per: you need bait
[2:03:45] zifirt: oh i thought you were talking about 1998~~ game lol
[2:03:53] BlackRe3per: or fish in a main city
[2:03:56] blazzedzz: Think he ment tides of darkness
[2:04:03] sengip: @Xaryu  do you think Rogue tanks will be more relevant in p2?
[2:04:04] budmodeos: I like wow because it’s kid friendly. black desert is too young adult. wow really has been the best game for us to actually play together long term.
[2:04:07] ninetysix: s1 SL was good
[2:04:10] tmillions936: 2 man deadmines @xaryu
[2:04:10] ndras: OG wotlk for arena for sure not this classic wotlk
[2:04:15] brent2041: I think you're right @Xaryu wow classic "seasons" and HC modes are probably the way to go
[2:04:19] phunkmastaflex: wotlk arena is bis imo
[2:04:21] budmodeos: so despite all the warts I’ll stick with it
[2:04:25] Tropicocity: healing stream totemmmm

[2:04:34] sengip: @Xaryu do you think Rogue tanks will be more relevant in p2??
[2:04:34] PMA_1: healing stream, cleanse
[2:04:35] sadalxx: Healing stream is strong
[2:04:44] NekoTheSpook010: Only healing is useful @ lvl25
[2:04:45] VitoBambino: chat is clinically insane if you think Wrath arena is better than any of the past 5 years
[2:04:50] fewd111: healing stream bounces POM for your priest
[2:04:52] Tropicocity: super important in raids/dungeons even if only to bounce prayer of mending from the priest
[2:05:01] BujuArena: MoP seasons 13, 14, and 15 were by far the best wow arena
[2:05:02] mizukeh: healing stream rocks in dungeon for sustain
[2:05:08] ozzzzziee: MoP was insane
[2:05:12] bburton02: Retail Andy lol
[2:05:15] VitoBambino: like yeah meta is annoying and nostalgia is powerful but the current game is soooo much more polished, smooth, and balanced
[2:05:16] GrishnerF: script-bots
[2:05:22] xiClutchBoyix: @vitobambino  "agree with me or you're insane" okkkk buddy
[2:05:25] snugglefistsgaming: its always solved.
[2:05:26] hooqs: @VitoBambino wotlk arena is def better then sl/df arena

[2:05:29] snugglefistsgaming: Always
[2:05:29] baddecisiondanx: @bburton02 classic lul
[2:05:29] BujuArena: i had 9 characters above 2k in MoP seasons 13, 14, and 15 because i could easily gear alts
[2:05:32] roebinho7: truege
[2:05:33] Fujinator: theirs not a lot of skillcap in wotlk either
[2:05:34] aciddkng: panda pvp
[2:05:35] nooblordxd: wotlk is so bad compared to retail
[2:05:35] Worldpeas: RLS for days
[2:05:39] ninetysix: u hit 20, did mitch start leveling ?
[2:05:43] jacksunson: Do you think youll play anymore WSG on your mage before phase 2?
[2:05:43] sheepown: i dont think thats true, xar.  i think ppl are figuring out new things
[2:05:46] VitoBambino: @xiClutchBoyix just say you're bad at retail kek
[2:05:47] Jackyboy21220: what's the most OP class in SoD in your opinion right now?>
[2:05:55] roebinho7: @sheepown i dont think so dude
[2:05:57] Goated_Goods: PvP is always dynamic though, and wotlk is the best version available for that. Retail is poo poo. Has been forever
[2:06:04] xiClutchBoyix: @vitobambino I'd have to play retail to know I'm bad at retail, no thank you.
[2:06:04] NekoTheSpook010: @xaryu don't forget totem for rune, 3 elements
[2:06:08] YuraruY: xarstomp looking good bro
[2:06:10] sheepown: its just harder bc there’s a larger base of knowledge
[2:06:11] PMA_1: are you gonna get R1 in cata just to say you did it like wotlk? @Xaryu
[2:06:21] berserage95: @goated_goods u think wrath pvp is dynamic lol u dont even play wow LUL
[2:06:22] baddecisiondanx: @goated_goods LOL OKAY
[2:06:32] thrushmaster69: Shamans have become to Tanky
[2:06:34] nooblordxd: if all you care about is arena and nothing else, retail is miles ahead of wotlk
[2:06:36] Deceasedcheeks: Do you have mana shield rune?
[2:06:41] asloff: i didnt really play bfa pvp but corruption in arena's seemed like an absolute clown fiesta
[2:06:43] Ironchin420: why do you have this golden dragon around your icon?
[2:06:50] bullbabear: these aoe pulls are so balsy for hardcore lol
[2:06:55] Worldpeas: what dagger are you using?
[2:06:56] NutterCircus: That shield block sound is music.
[2:07:03] Erockk610: @Xaryu When you get the chance to go two one handers with lava lash do it its a game changer
[2:07:03] mizukeh: I remember like it was yesterday where Xarstomp was squishy and just heading in to RFC but emerging a glorious warror which can take on a fleet of Marines !
[2:07:04] weedah: I just finished my 3rd Mcdonalds cheeseburger, and I am instantly regretting it.  2 was enough...
[2:07:16] Deomas11: 3 diff elements on the SAME enemey
[2:07:17] Zuggith: has to be all on same mobv
[2:07:22] sarrgasso: what is shaman longest range attack?
[2:07:27] Granteater4: Tauren poking people with a dagger is breaking my brain
[2:07:32] Tropicocity: lightning bolt -> flame shock -> finish with frost shock
[2:07:34] JuggaBugga: FROSTSHOC
[2:07:36] Aruwen8: Frost shock, molten, earth shock...all 3
[2:07:38] woodehxx: lightning shield?
[2:07:39] NutterCircus: You lose way of earth
[2:07:50] Deomas11: use lower ranks so you dont kill them in the process
[2:07:52] Chimmm1: Yo, is that Kresh's back?
[2:07:53] fewd111: IIRC it won't count your weapon enchants to the inspiration
[2:07:57] davepyo: 8 inches of snow here in Jersey, so home from work !
[2:08:07] Deceasedcheeks: In my shaman I got it, you do less burst and might be annoying to keep aoe aggro but not being oom between every pull or in the middle of a boss fight is WAY better, you're gonna like it.
[2:08:09] Chimmm1: Chimmm1 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:08:17] NutterCircus: Its Kreshs back. gachiHYPER
[2:08:23] PMA_1: ez click
[2:08:36] sheepown: @roebinho7 take a look at smash melee which has had meta game for characrers change drastically to this day.  with literally no updates to the game.  ppl are doing new and differnt things in wrath. its just that most ppl dont think about how to do things differently
[2:08:41] ninetysix: @Xaryu  do you think if blizzard extend phase 1 for 2 or 3 weeks, will people figure out  new builds i.e. devastate warrior
[2:08:42] Jackyboy21220: Yo @Xaryu what's the most OP class in SoD in your opinion at the moment?

[2:13:03] j_dillinger777: r1 keyboard turn
[2:13:03] prodigymanny: how do you get the water shield rune?
[2:13:06] joonelius3: water shield is good when you have people pulling threat from you.
[2:13:09] llnikon: note that water shield is free too
[2:13:10] zonewwolfen: Water shield double shocks is da wae
[2:13:13] Aevalous: u will naturally spend less mana now that you dont have your aoe :(
[2:13:14] Goated_Goods: Watershield goes best with DW but if you don't have the rune it may not be so strong
[2:13:15] Towenaar2: water shield is free
[2:13:26] toiletfellow: toiletfellow subscribed with Prime.

[2:13:44] Goated_Goods: Still better then lightning shield though, manage the 5 sec rule well since it doesn't incur with WS
[2:13:45] eygton: chat do you know if he got any blues from WC?
[2:13:46] Riddle010: double rockbiter
[2:13:47] PMA_1: i use DW watershield as a resto shaman @Xaryu

[2:14:34] Goated_Goods: Lightning shield's mana per dps is horrible
[2:14:41] Solithic: i dw tank bfd with dw on chest/water shield/way of earth
[2:14:43] NutterCircus: Would be lit if shams get titans grip in p2.
[2:14:59] morat_g: Need a water shield weak aura now
[2:15:08] cargar: do you use a ui add on?
[2:15:18] j_dillinger777: dual wield shaman heal with maelstorm would be POGGERS
[2:15:23] PMA_1: water shield also does not trigger 5 second rule @Xaryu
[2:15:25] Goated_Goods: Great minds think alike! That's why our family business loves you! :)
[2:15:25] zonewwolfen: Lightning shield is good when you need to hit instantly with a little dmg to finishing something.
[2:15:36] Ebsoulo: You kinda look like blastoise with that shield on your back
[2:15:37] SarcasticApe: the moaning of the mobs HUH

[2:40:31] alpacabowldood: and need to be lvl 25
[2:40:33] HiddenChin: that should be an exceptions.
[2:40:36] jsonlee7: you would need engineering and pattern from DM

[2:40:40] NekoTheSpook010: Only if you get the recepie from DM
[2:40:41] Woah_Zerk: shredder turbochargers would require about 30 autoshredder salvage units, which require the plan to drop from Sneed
[2:40:43] IHOP_Dan: without engi it's impossible
[2:40:43] Vertov64: You doing a shaman on SSF? Not a mage or druid?

[2:40:58] xWizard_Dx: dont have to be engi
[2:40:58] FreywulfHC: you need to kill dark iron dwarves - the 30 elites in Wetlands
[2:40:59] Aevalous: pattern can drop but you only get ONE TRY
[2:40:59] Valencia_Pete: not even worth
[2:41:02] NekoTheSpook010: Can drop
[2:41:03] FridayKnightMagic: but you need to the drop from DM yeah it drops if you don’t have it
[2:41:04] bryn_dee: yes it can drop because its a boe pattern
[2:41:05] Holydefeatt: patern drops even if youre not engi
[2:41:05] morat_g: It'd be like 10 hrs of farming
[2:41:14] aujewinashoe: pattern can drop without engi
[2:41:15] niall_9: No chance on SSF
[2:41:17] tuna_sandw1ch: @morat_g an average work day for a farmer
[2:41:17] jsonlee7: not worth imo
[2:41:25] rodavlasilad: Tanking on kelris with a shield on? :-(
[2:41:28] aujewinashoe: not worth at all
[2:41:30] xWizard_Dx: Not worth

[2:41:34] Rancor36: it took me literally all day to get the ordinance/fishoil for it

[3:09:10] Kazunya_Meowryu: Do you think Pikaboo is carried by all the addons he uses for pvp? @Xaryu
[3:09:21] BujuArena: it's a totem though, and there's a specific setting for "totem" instead of "buff"
[3:09:25] gnomefighter666: TMW lets you track searing totem

[3:10:53] gnomefighter666: weak auras suck
[3:10:54] TodBobertson: DONT USE TEMPLATE ROFL JUST MAKE IT DO WHAT YOU WANT
[3:10:54] animalswoww: you might have to track the buff it gives you, not the totem itself
[3:10:56] blazzedzz: What about full glory no WA just all natty skill?
[3:11:08] morat_g: Cd tracking then customize maybe
[3:11:24] Wechanor: if only kai was a little older to help his boomer dad with tech stuff

[3:11:52] PMA_1: https://wago.io/wZSaUvMII
[3:11:55] BujuArena: that's an elite
[3:11:56] espi: yes
[3:12:00] CIamzy: Ah shit
[3:12:01] espi: you'd get a new ID and invalidate
[3:12:02] SovereignAii: No, it would say "get out"
[3:12:03] NutterCircus: You get 10 seconds
[3:12:03] morat_g: Ye
[3:12:06] HEXEDstream: I thought the same thing but I think youre right.
[3:12:07] D_I_X_0_N: yup
[3:12:08] Locdawg: ??
[3:12:10] Seline88: only if you get saved I think?
[3:12:11] ProffBallsac: whos gonna make you delete it
[3:12:12] ddevillax: u get a few sec to get out
[3:12:14] BujuArena: nice one
[3:12:14] SovereignAii: You get some time to go out @Xaryu
[3:12:16] TodBobertson: Just tell you to GTFO is all no invalidate
[3:12:17] D_I_X_0_N: it would create a second instance id
[3:12:17] Jessrabbit1: dumb rule
[3:12:19] shakejunthc: Only one way to confirm
[3:12:22] sunny_lik: DO IT
[3:12:23] HiddenChin: meh
[3:12:29] VirtualMokus: get totemtimers addon @xaryu that shows shields
[3:12:34] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu you say you use WA cause the community makes alot more WAs than tellmewhen but every WA you are given you hate, so id say just use tellmewhen LOL
[3:12:34] typer___iban: its personal challenge chat, running in dungeon to live is lame af wym HUH
[3:12:42] DenLenne: your horde, they know no honor
[3:12:44] Mavzerick: You are TECHNICALLY correct, the best kind of correct!
[3:12:48] BujuArena: @VirtualMokus that is literally the one he just removed
[3:12:49] FreywulfHC: the addon would invalidate your run - not even the honor system
[3:12:53] SovereignAii: You can go in, you just have to go out before the timer that appears ticks down @Xaryu
[3:12:54] TodBobertson: It just tells you to leave because it is a new ID, does NOT fail your run unless you actually run the new ID
[3:12:55] NobudeLand: Id isn't created by entering
[3:13:03] mumbley: a serpentbloom to your right
[3:13:16] BujuArena: tellmewhen is the one with "totem" instead of "buff"
[3:13:20] morat_g: Eagle eyes
[3:13:22] ezentricks: tmw is 100 times more convenient than wa
[3:13:26] D_I_X_0_N: can track the actual buff not the totem itself?
[3:13:33] NutterCircus: WA has a weird dead section on your screen. When you find it, it will drive you nuts.
[3:13:34] Foldim: You heard the man. Mod me
[3:13:37] gnomefighter666: pick absent instead of present
[3:13:46] zerozuckerl: going for tellmewhen after using weakauras once is like going back to softcore after hc
[3:13:52] zerozuckerl: no glory
[3:13:53] ketchgg: @Xaryu i have a pretty good WA for all totem types if you want. covers them all
[3:13:55] Kazunya_Meowryu: EZ
[3:13:56] BujuArena: tellmewhen is so intuitive
[3:13:56] morat_g: Wow
[3:14:05] gnomefighter666: tmw>>>>>>>>>wa
[3:14:05] jeneraljelly: You just need to learn how to make WA lol
[3:14:06] morat_g: Tell me when is actually bis, never used it
[3:14:07] sondena: yeah
[3:14:10] moilert: i agree, i always use TMW
[3:14:10] sondena: best addon
[3:14:11] 4ddic7: Tell me juan
[3:14:12] feistygoat37: Shtup and download it then
[3:14:14] mountainsandmemes: i missed it
[3:14:16] ezentricks: yep WA sucks, unless u actually need it
[3:14:23] robtest: I will never give it up   /tmw ftw !!!
[3:14:24] justpeacealways: If you had elvui, your mind would be blown
[3:14:25] Flaaf: Easier, but less customizable
[3:14:30] playerpersonx: is this another iphone vs android?
[3:14:31] spunkfilleddowny: You seem to crit a lot of 69s
[3:14:32] ASideEffect: just tell me when an dI will do that
[3:14:35] Seline88: @feistygoat37 u good? 😂
[3:14:37] morat_g: Big upgrade
[3:14:41] sondena: wa is only for raid cds and such imo
[3:14:43] alexandrub: @Xaryu  on my shamy i also use a lot of /castsequence macros t
[3:14:44] HiddenChin: uge
[3:14:45] sengip: upgrade for sure
[3:14:45] al_capow: I really really really hope they give us a way to click off shaman weapon ench next phase
[3:14:47] al_capow: its so broken
[3:14:49] HEXEDstream: Casually upgrading.
[3:14:53] BujuArena: tellmewhen author would be so happy to see that clip
[3:14:55] Kuljor: tmw has always been more accesable, and wa more powerful so both are good in their own way
[3:15:01] Nozemdeca1: does anyone know when SSF is releasing?!?
[3:15:01] kaizen421: @al_capow why is that needed?
[3:15:05] BujuArena: somebody clip that maybe?
[3:15:07] playerpersonx: @al_capow getting wild strikes as enhance is a fucking chore holy shit
[3:15:07] NutterCircus: EZ
[3:15:18] morat_g: That one was actually less than 6 seconds to make lol
[3:15:40] jacoboss23: LUL
[3:15:42] BujuArena: "weapon imbue"
[3:15:53] morat_g: Damn they thought it through
[3:15:58] tr0bs: TMW goated
[3:16:02] ezbaris: xD
[3:16:03] al_capow: @playerpersonx literally im eyeballing my buff bar praying I didnt accidentally hit it when wild strikes fell off
[3:16:05] al_capow: its so bad
[3:16:08] ezentricks: its almost like tmw is better for 99% of content
[3:16:09] Indomitablez: @Xaryu I swear there was an addon for auto wand right click and auto shot w/ hunter right click but i cant find it. Do you know of one?
[3:16:11] YuraruY: u didnt put the name of the spell on the rockbitter one
[3:16:16] Am0n3r: @Xaryu I used to have TMW say "Idiot" outloud when I had Arcane Intellect not on
[3:16:19] NutterCircus: PogU
[3:16:23] robtest: they have been updating it for the  rune spells too !!!
[3:16:25] gnomefighter666: make the totem icons shake when they appear in notifications->animation
[3:16:27] mumbley: serpentbloom in front of you
[3:16:32] ezbaris: Allahinizi sikiyim oclar xD
[3:16:33] Am0n3r: yuuup

[3:17:24] BujuArena: you can use the rockbiter icon as a custom icon though
[3:17:42] mrbenzim: Man to man is a wolf
[3:17:55] al_capow: Xaryu there is a fatty WA for automatic rune sets though, like to swap between enh/tank/pvp etc
[3:17:55] NutterCircus: I always skip the serpentbloom quest because its too troll.
[3:17:56] Kydar: What glass water bottle is that? I'm looking for one
[3:17:57] BujuArena: otherwise it will just be a generic weapon icon
[3:18:02] playerpersonx: TMW is great at certain stuff but it has limitations. There's no way I could make a TMW that alerts no water shield stacks but also shows no LS stacks when I dont have water shield rune equipped

[3:18:30] sengip: WA is for nerdsssssssss
[3:18:33] doctor_anoos: it's more robust.
[3:18:33] kyuul55: weak aura is trash, never used it
[3:18:36] joonelius3: I use weakauras if I get a ready import
[3:18:37] Tbiz87: just that brief interaction through you leaning towards tmw
[3:18:39] biglychillin: @Xaryu WA =  ANDROID & TMW = IPHONE. MAKES SENSE.
[3:18:41] Jubilation12: @sengip good players*
[3:18:44] NutterCircus: WA is fine until you find that dead space on your screen.
[3:18:45] Pheiro: WA = Target TMW = Walmart
[3:18:47] Len1366: Does TMW work in SoD? I installed it early on and it was missing all the rune stuff.
[3:18:49] playerpersonx: @biglychillin OMEGALUL
[3:18:51] DrewPBallz18: pikaboo said u wiped in WC?
[3:18:51] dizzyrob91: WA but no clue how to set something up so just copy
[3:18:53] swyftboi: would try tmw after seeing that, but never found a WA I couldn’t make
[3:18:53] kmilmuza: @biglychillin true
[3:18:53] Kazunya_Meowryu: Also nothing is holding you back from having TMW and WA and just use WA if its some raid necessary stuff, my motto is just play the game the way that you like,
[3:18:56] BlackRe3per: you can with WAs too
[3:18:56] baddecisiondanx: WA
[3:18:58] tsetse2fly: How about both?
[3:19:02] al_capow: WA lets you make way more, like an auto rune set, which will be super nice next phase with even more runes to equip
[3:19:05] al_capow: https://wago.io/hJR-gBib_

[3:19:11] morat_g: Both is probably bis for retail
[3:19:34] SeniorUrraca: Weak auras is overkill tbh, sometimes I just want 1% of weakauras power
[3:19:40] montanushd: montanushd subscribed with Prime. 
[3:19:47] DrewPBallz18: comeback and play frost mage on retail
[3:19:50] largist_: how many of chats WA likers actually script it themselves, or just get premade from url
[3:19:50] provender_: @Xaryu is this your first time playing shammy ever?

[3:20:21] dycegamer: What happened to Troll shaman?
[3:20:21] ryan___mcg: i don’t understand how to use TMW , like i literally just want to track my war stomp but position it so it’s closer to my character @xaryu
[3:20:31] Stinkfyst: the 10 sec condition is hidden
[3:20:32] zNeffy: what belt are you planning to make ?
[3:20:36] YuraruY: bc u inverted the visibility

[3:21:40] flankhog: Hey @Xaryu long time, is SSF official or done with addon still?
[3:21:48] PMA_1: lets boring with water shield to be honest, pressing more buttons lol.
[3:21:49] r4men_noodle: I farmed for like 4 hours and got 7 scales
[3:21:49] TestosteroneTea: @largist_ I usually grab a script and change it to my liking
[3:21:50] mrbenzim: 10 minutes inly dealing with UI
[3:21:53] cheezywiz: what happened to Kresh's back?
[3:21:57] StandardOut: @Xaryu How is Kai's first toon coming along? Level 25 Full BiS right?

[3:22:03] jacoboss23: chat be ready for DING!
[3:22:05] NutterCircus: Making a little human is a lot of work.
[3:22:10] morat_g: Ding time
[3:22:11] biglychillin: we need some more perfect deviates, xar. are you even trying?
[3:22:18] Len1366: perfects are rare
[3:22:42] pogxgaming: THOSE ARE HUGEEEEEEEEE
[3:22:51] kaizen421: spirit is kinda meh for sham yeah
[3:22:56] Kazunya_Meowryu: prob pika on an alt
[3:23:08] zeitungsleser30: hey man just wanted to let you know that im here now

[3:23:25] defiantfate: Are you doing DM ?
[3:23:26] typer___iban: :D
[3:23:27] Beggebin: That's how I feel about pally
[3:23:32] TestosteroneTea: FirstTimeChadder
[3:23:33] Xzanelol: yes its brutal
[3:23:34] pmanfit91: Think about Boomy, bro.
[3:23:35] Xzanelol: same with ret pally
[3:23:35] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Shaman one regular vanilla while leveling solo is painful
[3:23:38] Kazunya_Meowryu: same with druid LOL and i think druid is x10 worse
[3:23:39] Nefenn: Yea agree on a lot of classes
[3:23:48] ainion23: hey Xar why has there been no dueling tourneys in SOD?
[3:23:48] NutterCircus: You get used to mage.
[3:23:49] acaciashrub: as a priest..... very same
[3:23:51] prfssrzaddy: That is why I did not level boomie
[3:23:53] kaizen421: as a rogue i could go back but sham? nahhh
[3:23:54] Retricz: @acaciashrub omg there actually is a YouTube video from 10 years ago of him doing it haha wow
[3:23:54] YamajiTV: i feel the same with hunter
[3:23:55] ragnarock676: SOD runes are pretty fun
[3:24:02] Libertas09: I like regular vanilla mage better where non rune abilities actually do real damage
[3:24:03] SarcasticApe: blizz did a great job with the runes
[3:24:10] Kazunya_Meowryu: @ainion23 I think they are waiting for the other phases
[3:24:10] xz00r: @Xaryu on my shaman i feel i don't even need mana sahield i get so much mana anyway??
[3:24:14] playerpersonx: @ainion23 im guessing cause level 25 isnt that interesting with so few abilities
[3:24:18] acaciashrub: @Retricz LOL yeah its a throwback xD
[3:24:21] thendj: i hope hotsstreak comes
[3:24:25] FlowersAnger: I can't wait to see all the different classic iterations they're hopefully going to do. I think it's safe to say that SoD is a pretty successful thing
[3:24:27] StandardOut: I am working right now. Dev stuff, not a master nerd just a dude. Im getting pumped about this DM run
[3:24:38] typer___iban: YEP
[3:24:41] superblur: mages didnt do alot of damage in vanilla without spell power
[3:24:45] chorrol1: thats how I feel about hunter
[3:24:48] FlowersAnger: SHaman feels so so barebones and not really well put together in era
[3:24:57] NutterCircus: My classic sham I tanked upto UBRS.
[3:25:08] adrise__: hard to go back after sod feral
[3:25:11] typer___iban: I am balance druid, with a shadow priest on back burner for p2
[3:25:11] steelhog90: think era is going to slowly die now
[3:25:14] feardotrun: nah warbringer is a major game changer
[3:25:17] zNeffy: @xaryu are planning to make deviate scale belt ? isn’t the pattern a quest reward is that allowed for hc ? I’m just curious cause I don’t know
[3:25:17] adrise__: era feral is garbage sod feral is amazing
[3:25:21] steelhog90: They will make something new when sod ends
[3:25:23] ProffBallsac: perfect scales are SUPER hard to come by
[3:25:35] FlowersAnger: It's podcast time
[3:25:42] JuggaBugga: can these elites drop the armor set?
[3:25:46] ca_Y_z: halp
[3:25:46] Puppette: not level 25 yet cuh?
[3:25:47] PeeDub1969: there are good mobs outside that round cave too
[3:25:48] UnsafeCell: plan to ding 25 with explore exp?
[3:25:49] stormrager117: Lurker LUCK
[3:25:52] Libertas09: My priest in SOD feels like I am better at what I was already able to do. Mage just felt so weird and played different to me. Like AOE pulls are face tanking vs CC play. Preference I guess
[3:25:58] Elwine: at 21 go inside wc
[3:25:59] stormrager117: And that's how we got the Deviant leather belt
[3:26:10] biglychillin: I ended my WC with 8 perfect deviates but I skinned everything. It was a wild ride.

[3:36:04] FlowersAnger: You will probably have to spend more than 10 hours in here to get it. Wouldn't be surprised tbh.
[3:36:12] S_Belwas: I feel like selling items on the AH could be a decent tradeoff
[3:36:22] lumpey: @Xaryu did u know ur my favorite? :)

[3:37:01] SgtPepperTTV: 10-12 hours for sure
[3:37:02] u_nit_y: @morat_g it usually is
[3:37:05] BrianAffair: jo i like to see this extraordinary gameplay after my team (holstein kiel) lost recently
[3:37:07] NotOp: Which means you statistically need like another 450 kills
[3:37:14] espi: hunters farm this in ~4 hours, but they kill much faster
[3:37:19] stormrager117: Chat hype for scales? GoldPLZ GoldPLZ GoldPLZ
[3:37:19] foxxys856: i got 7 from 3 full runs of skinning wc and the group was nice to wait so i have no idea how long this is gonna take u
[3:37:23] Phoenix3215: @Xaryu use Erebril's Water Shield Reminder for weak aura
[3:37:24] Blurri88: @xaryu how far do you think SoD will go till? All of classic? AQ bug farm... again? Lol could be fun tho
[3:37:25] HiddenChin: u will be 25 by then
[3:37:28] HEXEDstream: Sucks. Its so much easier on the mind when you can farm in the instance.
[3:37:29] swyftboi: rip not skinning in WC
[3:37:29] typer___iban: EZ 450
[3:37:33] FlowersAnger: You should go celan out ur bags so u have space for all the grey stuff. You're going to spend so much time here that it's good money in the end.
[3:37:35] HoppsAlot: @christiandedominicis Good luck with your new job, bro! Hope you dig it.

[3:38:03] aadeBirger: Just got here, any good lots yet Xar??
[3:38:04] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu in hindsight you should've leveled up your skinning before the WC run
[3:38:10] BrianAffair: how strong is shaman in sod in your opinion after this sodcore runs?
[3:38:10] manitaru: you full natty bro?
[3:38:11] swyftboi: he doesn’t know about that grind yet
[3:38:18] Foldim: we wont tell, promise
[3:38:19] cookie_jayy: damn even at 25 when there is some pre bis from quest gear?
[3:38:20] RaavGaming: Ever play valheim
[3:38:22] mrbenzim: So why the recipe is allowed?
[3:38:31] FreywulfHC: Zero quest equipment - consumable items are allowed
[3:38:32] stormstruck12: @HoppsAlot Thanks I appreciate that! Lots of learning, first corporate experience so chugging along
[3:38:35] froobister90: @Xaryu so riddle me this.... if no quest loot is allowed then how come yall get to do recipe
[3:38:39] u_nit_y: @mrbenzim excellent question
[3:38:42] Cross86: Valheim is a great game
[3:38:43] aadeBirger: @manitaru no he plays wow 8 hours a day
[3:38:46] foxxys856: its a reward tho
[3:38:50] FalanthosDB: valheim has a hardcore mode
[3:38:54] cookie_jayy: :(
[3:38:56] calebito_: mhm
[3:38:58] HEXEDstream: I think "quest gear" was the original idea.
[3:38:59] shamshield79: What up xar!
[3:39:01] TodBobertson: You mixing the word "loot" and "gear" up. A pattern is 100% loot.
[3:39:04] stache007: its not gear directly ,  so patern is fine imo
[3:39:12] venkatreddy217: @christiandedominicis Are you an engineer?
[3:39:12] Quick_Boy: @foxxys856 yea its a reward, but they didnt say quest rewards, they said quet loot
[3:39:13] BrianAffair: dm hype dm hype dm hype dm hype dm hype dm hype dm hype dm hype dm hype
[3:39:14] THEHONEYBADGUR: consumables are allowed and patterns are kinda consumes
[3:39:17] 808polska: deadminess for the glory!
[3:39:23] nocturnus24: ah makes sense
[3:39:28] HEXEDstream: Itll be easier to farm at 25.
[3:39:28] CIamzy: Does Westfall flag you?
[3:39:29] mrbenzim: @u_nit_y I'm great at asking questions :P
[3:39:29] 808polska: Guzu soloed it :s
[3:39:30] largist_: are you planning to use the quest bag for deviate hides? might be worth picking it before continuing scale hunt
[3:39:41] justpeacealways: theres an addon for that. to tell you whats in your bank without going to it
[3:39:44] Bolt_: What about Lucky Charms? Are those allowed?
[3:39:44] stormstruck12: @venkatreddy217 nah I am a project manager in an IT field (but I am not IT)
[3:39:49] cookie_jayy: @CIamzy no
[3:39:51] Bolt_: RIP
[3:39:53] Vashlolz: Technically a pattern is a consumable..
[3:39:55] morat_g: You should buy 8 slot bags if you haven't yet
[3:39:58] manitaru: I mean at least your getting xp
[3:40:00] venkatreddy217: @christiandedominicis cool. Gratz.
[3:40:02] THEHONEYBADGUR: cant sell lucky charms anyway FeelsBadMan
[3:40:07] icyhawtt: Allowing all that should change guild name to softcore
[3:40:09] Heliconz: did you watch episode 4 already?
[3:40:12] BrianAffair: you didnt equip the bags last time. where ware your boundaries with sodcore?
[3:40:24] Heliconz: daaang
[3:40:27] shamshield79: Any handstand tips?
[3:40:27] Heliconz: cant wait
[3:40:28] stormstruck12: @venkatreddy217 Thank you! Been craving for an opportunity
[3:40:28] foxxys856: @Quick_Boy its from a quest regardless to me anything from a quest should come directly ben none usable but its not my rule so it does kinda seem iffy considering that belt is like prebis too
[3:40:30] typer___iban: peepoHappy
[3:40:32] saoirigi: 2???
[3:40:32] lordhodza: why not clear DM? maybe a decent belt drops. Going for this may be a lil too HARD....core
[3:40:35] manitaru: You double dipped today?
[3:40:39] typer___iban: 2 peepoHappy
[3:40:41] Darkpain876: HUH
[3:40:53] venkatreddy217: @christiandedominicis yea, job market's been rough past year (esp. IT field)

[3:41:16] HiddenChin: Back up to the wall
[3:41:16] cookie_jayy: same thing with everything
[3:41:23] froobister90: @Xaryu started crossfit. and wall walks are insane.. whats your thoughts on them?
[3:41:24] Fnyyf: Balancing through finger pressure is a good tip tho. (ex gymnast)
[3:41:31] starlight_aria: Is it worth starting playing classic era now?
[3:41:31] stormstruck12: @venkatreddy217 what do you do?
[3:41:37] cookie_jayy: ueah tru
[3:41:38] GotLuck: like singing
[3:41:53] u_nit_y: acting
[3:41:55] greedouszek: Xar i got a question.... Why a lot of rogue at retail got at off hand low speed weapon? or there is a deal for better stat? beacuse dagger got a crit mace mastery ^... so for sub looking worth for burst window ^. When i ask some1 at open world they just didnt know.... they follow other ppl ^....
[3:41:59] pimpdaddyping: @Xaryu what was the similar deadlift movement you did on the box like a week ago
[3:42:06] venkatreddy217: @christiandedominicis software engineer at tech company in California usa
[3:42:06] canonic: bench press isn't a skill
[3:42:09] Bolt_: Yeah, like weighing 220lbs at 10% body fat, you may want to avoid that amount of pressure on your wrists
[3:42:19] SgtDirtbag: handstands alot about training the brain
[3:42:19] Dobronx8: @canonic .... Yes it is
[3:42:22] jeneraljelly: @greedouszek lower OH weapons speed procs more poisons
[3:42:22] manitaru: @GotLuck Singing is a great example, there is a level of natural skill that is really hard to overcome.
[3:42:30] FkinKiddingMe: deadmines any minute now?
[3:42:32] stormstruck12: @venkatreddy217 hopefully you are remote, or at least hybrid
[3:42:32] Bolt_: There's absolutely a skill component to lifting
[3:42:34] hobosam87: have you done deadmines yet?
[3:42:36] Libertas09: It's definitely part skill / neuro muscular coordination
[3:42:37] assassinage92: Correct
[3:42:38] Bolt_: Who the fuck said that
[3:42:39] Bolt_: lol
[3:42:40] spekkert: I would disagree @Xaryu , im sure there is a weightless benchpress practice you can do that doesnt push your muscles but does practices the right movement
[3:42:42] Indomitablez: @Xaryu you and Sonii should do a podcast/squad stream one day about fitness
[3:42:43] HEXEDstream: Definitely a wrong way to bench press
[3:42:44] berserage95: tell powerlifting comps bench press takes no skill LUL
[3:42:48] shamshield79: biggest bench skill is not wrecking your shoulders
[3:42:50] venkatreddy217: @christiandedominicis yep :D U2?
[3:42:51] Dobronx8: Idk what @canonic is smoking
[3:42:54] sengip: Opinion on TRT?

[3:43:02] cookie_jayy: can you cartwheel
[3:43:07] RaavGaming: Advice to improve my pelvic thrust capability. 3 kids and i dont feel my max has improved
[3:43:09] HoppsAlot: My fiance gets frustrated when doing strength training because it never "feels right". Any suggestions?
[3:43:09] Bolt_: Literally an olympic sport... Chat: "ThErE iS nO SkIlL"
[3:43:11] greedouszek: @jeneraljelly but for sub?
[3:43:13] canonic: @Dobronx8  it most definitely is not
[3:43:16] stormstruck12: @venkatreddy217 technically hybrid but have a 1.5 hour commute one way so my boss understands whatever I choose
[3:43:18] DenLenne: i used to bench 135kg for 5
[3:43:23] humble26: wait till your 50
[3:43:29] Indomitablez: @Xaryu You sonii and Baj need to do a podcast day/squad stream day about fitness im sure a lot would watch/listen

[3:45:24] adamanttv101: use it
[3:45:25] playerpersonx: I always thought TRT was sort of overhyped and that it wouldn't give you insane results, but then I read a research paper where they gave a person TRT and he never even lifted a single weight and still put on 1.6x more muscle in a month than someone who lifted but didnt participate
[3:45:27] lordhodza: Savix 2 shot his Banana
[3:45:29] Viliusjas: your character doesnt get more powerful = no glory increase @Xaryu
[3:45:34] morat_g: Sell and buy 8 slotters

[3:45:48] u_nit_y: i was not wrong
[3:45:49] biiggy: use it, if u die its still gone lol
[3:45:50] Ifwuzzy: i want a nana
[3:45:56] NutterCircus: I feel like they made LW a chore.
[3:45:57] combopoints: NOOO
[3:45:57] PeeDub1969: sell it at least
[3:46:03] morat_g: Buy 8 slot bags sir
[3:46:08] pimpdaddyping: @playerpersonx what dosage did they give and did the person already have a low t level
[3:46:12] magnaeus: delete all your bags for ultimate glory
[3:46:12] berserage95: @playerpersonx i dont think that was trt, that was supraphysiological dose of test
[3:46:13] manitaru: xarPain xarPain
[3:46:17] JarJar_Brinkz: Do bagless Glory challenge
[3:46:19] HEXEDstream: Common gray Shirt. BIS
[3:46:21] u_nit_y: 4 years later. god damn
[3:46:25] oldpeanutz: Maybe buy some 8-slots at least
[3:46:30] Heliconz: @playerpersonx people really dont realize how insanely effective testosterone is for muscle building
[3:46:37] macjcool: blood and thunder
[3:46:55] snugglefistsgaming: what level can you equip that ring?
[3:47:07] Seoken1: maybe we will get some pants today
[3:47:07] playerpersonx: @pimpdaddyping they gave a fairly moderate dose afaik. Much much lower than competitive body builders

[3:47:41] berserage95: @pimpdaddyping moderate =/= trt tho, zoomers getting their steroid knowledge from influencers
[3:47:46] playerpersonx: @playerpersonx yeah TRT is probably the wrong term. They were injections and greater than normally present in the body
[3:47:51] m00zs: did you know that we should actually lick the banana instead of eating? there is a kind of string inside it that makes chewing difficult
[3:47:53] ikennae: will there ever commong retail pvp again?

[3:49:04] itzSKIIZO: @stormrager117 its in a crate on the ground
[3:49:07] berserage95: @baddecisiondanx have u had bloods to check that works for u?
[3:49:11] playerpersonx: @berserage95 you're right it wasnt TRT but injections, same as competitive bodybuilders. I used the wrong term. Also, I'm older than you
[3:49:16] jstuwie: Is oomed going to do BFD with you too?

[3:50:55] GotLuck: when SSF comes out will you still see other players in the world or will it just be you?
[3:50:56] Seoken1: Xar could technically still walk too close to guards and pvp flag on this server, but that is unlikely
[3:50:56] SgtPepperTTV: just save them and if you have nothing to do you can farm it
[3:50:56] hayvex: What day is the SSF raid?
[3:50:59] espi: its bis but a long farm, keep it until the end?
[3:50:59] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips

[3:52:23] r4men_noodle: The gloves you need prot pot for
[3:52:27] manitaru: Heading to the gym, cardio or weights first?
[3:52:36] 775anthonymike: cant make the gloves it need elixirs
[3:52:36] drewbuckler: drewbuckler subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:52:39] espi: there's 2 shoulder patterns, one is vendor
[3:52:44] ebe____: @manitaru weight
[3:52:49] oldpeanutz: weights first man
[3:52:50] Sulphur_: stretch first
[3:52:57] karhun: really loved that xarbarian challenge are u planning some barbarian content at sod ?
[3:52:57] espi: the vendor one requires elemental earths tho
[3:52:57] combopoints: Maybe light cardio to warm up but nothing crazy before weights
[3:52:58] darkom31: blue gloves require alch first
[3:52:58] Indomitablez: I like to do str first then hit cardio when im exhausted and try to push myself on cardio
[3:52:59] oldpeanutz: Nah stretching does nothing
[3:53:01] raxxom: weight first. fuck cardio
[3:53:04] THEHONEYBADGUR: whats the vendor in terms of stats espi ?
[3:53:05] berserage95: @Sulphur_ LUL
[3:53:10] espi: the traveling merchant between Tarren Mill
[3:53:10] ebe____: @raxxom this man knows the shit
[3:53:15] prfssrzaddy: Short cardio warm up then weights is my usual
[3:53:19] Taikawa_: long time admirer first time follower, your content has been so good lately brother keep it up!
[3:53:24] espi: Earthen Shoulders I think they're called
[3:53:26] Cross86: i do cardio to start out and then weights. i feel doing cardio helps with circulation and warming up your muscles. making it easier to push more
[3:53:27] HoppsAlot: How do you feel about the naked challenge? too much?
[3:53:28] pimpdaddyping: i mean tbh test helps most with recovery does help build muscle especially if you arent on a trt dosage but the recovery is insane
[3:53:34] THEHONEYBADGUR: i only found a stam one on my hunter
[3:53:34] darkowitz1444: Quit vaping this year Xar and I havent felt  this good in years. Been hitting the gym three times a week at least, my motivation to do everything is so much more :)
[3:53:39] ebe____: if u need just cardio do + 10 reps
[3:53:40] tsetse2fly: If you do slow zone 2 cardio it's perfect to do before hitting the weights
[3:53:42] largist_: have you planned some extra challenge for ssf rouge
[3:53:43] Chatmonkey14: Bro I was struggling to feed the fam. I closed 80k worth of deals this month and had your stream in the background whole time. Last month 8k
[3:53:44] Xzanelol: im really surprised you dont wanna go paladin for official HC
[3:53:45] wazza76: Can you remeber the troll warrior who only did unarmed combat, might be worth trying that :)
[3:53:54] hankslapshot: U have to be  leather worker for the void touched stuff??
[3:53:58] mrbenzim: too hard or too dumb.
[3:54:00] espi: That's the vendor shoulder pattern: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7362/pattern-earthen-leather-shoulders

[3:54:22] SarcasticApe: + no dopamin because of drops
[3:54:24] Udenwo: Has to be fun lol
[3:54:25] N4A5T: hard but realistic
[3:54:37] StandardOut: Zone 1-2 warm up for 10 minutes. Generic static stretching starting on ground ending standing. 45 minutes of weight lifting. Having exhausted your musscies, you can now do Zone 2 cardio for 20-30 minutes for a nice warm down or Zone 1 for an hour to cool down.
[3:54:42] u_nit_y: @HoppsAlot :O

[4:57:26] stroobzbeats: imo this is one of the most sketch parts of the dungeon
[4:57:32] Clayray53: what about raiding @xaryu ? isn’t that a bad rune to choose for raiding BFD?
[4:57:37] thrushmaster69: Mage healers and rogue tanks should be removed
[4:57:37] danbalanceltrist: remove petris
[4:57:46] RaavGaming: isnt spamming water shield a + EV ability?
[4:57:48] Frozello: Glory is without petri

[4:58:02] mfnoah: earthbind is huge here they run away everytime
[4:58:03] TheMeescoman: How are you liking shaman Xar?
[4:58:09] cactavius: it’s an item in the game. why not use it if it can save you
[4:58:13] Thorronn: how do you handle threat in group pulls with water shield?
[4:58:16] Duckduckgoose38: What no I love rogue tanking I can't wait for AOE threat
[4:58:18] thrushmaster69: @cretinismozzy Just doesn’t make any sense
[4:58:21] Reaperz_kinetic: @thrushmaster69 nah mage heals is fun af
[4:58:25] sixfeet4inches: alternate water shield and molten in BFD.
[4:58:31] kalismic: what does water shield do on SoD? @Xaryu
[4:58:31] thrushmaster69: from a class perspective
[4:58:32] MrStLouis68: mage dps should be removed. broken ahh
[4:58:33] morat_g: It ruins class fantasy and lore imo, tank shaman makes sense to include
[4:58:37] HarryJPotter94: Rod of the Ancient Sleepwalker just dropped and I lost to a pug Sadge
[4:58:37] JuggerNot_76: makes each class less unique
[4:58:42] lasagnalord13: @thrushmaster69 isnt the whole reason for this season to have things that don't make a lot of sense?
[4:58:47] tigerslap_ow: what do you use for taunting?
[4:58:47] squarepusher_: @thrushmaster69 It's SoD. All bets are off.
[4:58:50] crvyxn: shaman threat so busted it's not too hard to generate threat on multiple mobs without molten blast
[4:58:52] tsetse2fly: @thrushmaster69 Rogue was almost a tank back in vanilla. Swashbuckler lore
[4:58:55] ctrlbeesy: wow classic so beautiful
[4:58:59] Tovone: I just dont like the rogue tanking class, all others are cool
[4:59:02] af10101: What server is this on @Xaryu
[4:59:05] elydas899: rockbiter + fast weapon helps a lot too, main a shaman tank myself
[4:59:10] zeneye711: shammy tank is really fun
[4:59:13] tigerslap_ow: thats a pretty bad ass tank
[4:59:21] The_Crane: Rockbitter also generates threat
[4:59:27] ragnarock676: Just DW with lava lash, you don't need the shield
[4:59:30] SgtDirtbag: the xarluck on loot is insane actually
[4:59:32] Schwierig: o7
[4:59:38] Drakazagra: oh shit
[4:59:38] Reaperz_kinetic: @thrushmaster69 btw some of these classes are somewhat lore accurate and almost happened back in OG classic
[4:59:41] AMSUNDAY: gg ez clap
[4:59:42] zeneye711: the play is duel weild rock bitter with shammnistic rage
[4:59:43] s13mko: o7

[5:00:35] OctorDoctorpus14: @Xaryu have you ever thought of key binding raid icons for close encounters like this?
[5:00:49] iSensimillhai: im confused can you not do five mans?
[5:00:50] grovel232: correct
[5:00:53] TroyStory__: Do you have any profs on this guy?
[5:01:02] shootsssmcgavin: Very high threat with Shocks
[5:01:03] ryan___mcg: @iSensimillhai less men more glory
[5:01:04] OctorDoctorpus14: @iSensimillhai you can as I do
[5:01:05] solidsnake0706: rockbiter generates a ton of threat
[5:01:09] CastielDrk: What's the best way to not get burnt out with SoD?
[5:01:09] drioplays: it's a taunt, but higher ranks probably produce more threat. but all you need is the taunt
[5:01:09] kalismic: Whats water shield do in SoD? same as retail?
[5:01:12] TroyStory__: AND an interrupt
[5:01:12] elydas899: @iSensimillhai i think he can only run the dungeon once, more ppl = more likely to lose loot
[5:01:18] Jkorn415: I feel like the taunt from it is less effective but I can’t confirm
[5:01:19] KlosH4X: RIP Menyon

[6:06:35] TodBobertson: I repeat, going into WC to reset mobs will NOT fail your run. It pops up a warning saying GTFO, but doesn't fail unless you actually go in and kill shit.
