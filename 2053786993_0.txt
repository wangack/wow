[0:24:54] Xammy0: xammy0Pog
[0:25:01] damepitaa: not worth on time
[0:25:19] MrSchneetzel: go do the escort
[0:25:48] Scoffered: RFK escort hard to hand in?
[0:25:53] coffeeJosh: 540-350 is only 190 exps, seems not worth the time
[0:26:21] climbingviking: doesn't he only spawn after the escort?
[0:26:29] windatar: He could kill like 2 mobs to make up for that exp that would take like 15 seconds or travel to that area to hand in that quest for 5 minutes, he might as well not do that and just grind for 5 minutes somewhere and get like 2k experience.
[0:26:36] damepitaa: there is another quest inside the dungeon
[0:26:36] Krabue: probably no
[0:27:10] Xammy0: lmao

[0:27:39] Powahfull: Did you gather all the STV pages I think that's like 5k exp

[0:34:04] windatar: Best case scenario is the box exp change is retroactive for all boxes if it is then hes sitting on a lot of exp if not that hes at least sitting on some exp and a lot of rep.

[0:37:55] windatar: Why not on launch? that experience is the same if you do it right away or not though. If anything getting it out of the way would get that first level done quickly? Specially if you have your viewers go instead of just regular pugs.

[0:40:36] Maniakajoe: aren't those boxes unavailable in phase 2 , because they said there will be new ones?

[0:49:57] nelms42: Do you start SFK?
[0:49:57] straightouttaroute66: I'll just heal dungeons for fun and it will take 3 weeks i bet ^^
[0:50:00] windatar: @eshonxv The nerf will be exp per hour because it will be slower, not that they will be unable too. Now if they put in the SoM changes next phase. Thats different.
[0:50:00] somebdk: they might be doing better because possible better runes or skills
[0:50:01] Joxtirol: you cant farm stockade all way to 40
[0:50:25] wuanluciano4: HOW LONG U THINK ITLL TAKE YOU TO HIT 40

[0:52:25] muteqqt: GM mate, i see you have farmed a lot of supply boxes, do you know how much exp they bring?
[0:52:40] windatar: Grab it and delete it otherwise that chest wont respawn.
[0:53:00] Krabue: @StaysafeTV 1st pig quest garbanzo. 2nd depend 3 slots and gives 1500xp, but 3rd quest free 3050 xp in crossroads

[0:58:57] nelms42: ADdicted to the waylaid
[0:59:08] windatar: Just think if they even just double the exp of the current boxes then you would have basically half a level in just boxes.
[0:59:09] Krabue: insanity
[0:59:11] jonnicle: gs?
[0:59:14] oochie1: @StaysafeTV How come you don't pick some of the cheap box mats to carry with you?
[0:59:16] Mawshaw: Filling those bags is starting to look mighty satisfying FeelsOkayMan

[0:59:58] ilcapitano777: grays was telling his stream it’s almost not worth to do for time and gold cost

[1:01:04] seymourmoney: he got you dude

[1:03:34] AxelFromAustralia: use the gnoll camps in wetlands so it takes you longer so you don’t worry about having no content
[1:04:08] solid_reaperx: @StaysafeTV you can only prebuy the heavy silk and the mageweave book notthe actual "skill up" book to 225
[1:04:09] scottiepalmer: hey man i just want to say i love you but im confused about your logic on the marks situation i have friends that say your an idiot for farming marks and i want to prove them wrong
[1:04:09] speedzombie: box gamer
[1:04:30] letsgetgoingyo: time to delete all your 180 boxes and grind them out. WE LOVE THE BOX GRIND
[1:04:34] Farenheight451: except at 9am on 30 september they are deleting marks and boxes and the boxes give 100k rep
[1:04:35] jmyrd: Think im behind on info, did they release xp per box tier?
[1:04:40] papaterb: papaterb subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:04:57] QuestFor420: Uhh lool
[1:05:10] windatar: There is a window where the marks you farm from pvp will go to your bank, that time is between the update/deletion of marks and when they go live. He will farm in that period.
[1:05:17] batmern_: bro is just trying to farm and people are hating KEKW
[1:05:38] scottiepalmer: well thats fair haha still cant wait till your cinnamon powergum comes out
[1:05:47] BigChoobs: BigChoobs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:05:48] jvanstry: Is this what it means to be a content creator in 2024…. grinding at a time spent rate of 20 now to 1 later?

[1:07:30] Jelerman: morning matt
[1:07:31] Etsku: i would grind this if you didnt have to run back every fucking time
[1:07:53] Frayeen: literally every game is repetitive
[1:08:05] fewd111: he asked a yes or no question and the answer is yes XD
[1:08:13] shaygauge24: which is why everyone only played de_dust2 in cs 1.5
[1:08:37] Revko64: life is repetitiv too
[1:08:46] jvanstry: I love this grind and was just wondering aloud at its hilarious futulity
[1:09:09] QuestFor420: Fuck him he's worthlessness
[1:09:14] Mind_G0bl1n: grinding deez nuts?
[1:09:19] Revko64: social is the only things interesting in gaming
[1:09:19] AxelFromAustralia: this dude probably works a 9-5 for minimum wage
[1:09:28] Ebsoni: Ebsoni subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! do you think they will add revered rewards to the supply box rep or only honored?
[1:09:30] shamrock55: NOPERS
[1:09:53] MrFrazierTTV: wait once the box is full you can have more than one!?
[1:09:55] Revko64: we dont like ai and robots
[1:09:59] ShimmyYah: show spec plz
[1:10:03] MrFrazierTTV: I just started SoD a few days ago lol
[1:10:12] windatar: Heard that they stealth nerfed the crate spawns in chests, since you've been farming for the last few days does it feel like the drop rate of crates from chests lessened over that time?
[1:10:21] jdaber1: that warrior was still there at like 6 est lol
[1:10:22] DeadlyRaiderArmy: So stocking up on waylaids for xp, i hope its going well overall i saw you had a good amount ready.
[1:10:24] shaygauge24: it makes sense to cap it at honored rewards then have rev for 50 and exalted for 60
[1:10:30] speedzombie: Futile means it does nothing is gained but hes gaining stuff
[1:10:48] abruptdecayO_O: why would they stealth nerf it, it takes so long just to farm a single one as is
[1:10:57] windatar: K so just the forums being regular whiners then. Lol.
[1:11:22] DeadlyRaiderArmy: D: complaining for no reason
[1:11:41] QuestFor420: Yeah fr lol
[1:11:43] jvanstry: @speedzombie ur right, my comment was objectively incorrect
[1:12:11] jmyrd: did they releaxe xp per box tier?
[1:12:12] windatar: Not to much different doing boxes and just regular gold farming.
[1:12:22] mattbarz989: just utilizing time left in a phase with nothing left to do
[1:12:24] nattyforyou: how much exp do u get per box
[1:12:25] pizac7: you also wont have to grind them later on for rep either if we get new stuff at revered
[1:12:28] tnak_1: Im not playing SoD, what are the boxes for?
[1:12:30] iknowido: those were way worse
[1:12:31] Sawfthandz: @StaysafeTV wait.. your viewers play WoW? I'm just here for your intelligent mind.
[1:12:45] Nydox: wheres a similar place to farm boxes on alliance side?

[3:35:47] graeme_tbm: Was hoping for shadowfury so destro pvp would be viable
[3:35:57] AxelFromAustralia: why not level 2 locks? 1 affy 1destro?
[3:36:03] NutterCircus: Space for at least 9 more.
[3:36:18] Etsku: holy shit you can !!!?!??!

[3:37:02] NutterCircus: We do need Duel spec.
[3:37:05] andyjamesgames: ya what’s wrong with adding Dual Spec ? making it free? change specs whenever ? what’s wrong with that
[3:37:08] Nathanew321: keeping it low keeps pvp alive
[3:37:08] Metaphix: why should it cost more? like whats the argument
[3:37:10] AxelFromAustralia: 1g is too much I ain’t doing allat
[3:37:11] einself111: dual spec pls
[3:37:14] ticeyx: affliction is never going to work for raiding in classic unless they add mobs with absolutely insane amounts of hp
[3:37:20] Nathanew321: @Metaphix gold sink
[3:37:26] heroesofnewworld: hmm...'kay
[3:37:32] andyjamesgames: @nathanew321 dual spec affects pvp?
[3:37:41] bongwaterfacewash: is this phase 2 waiting room?
[3:37:54] crispytheaussie: flight path, repair bill, AH cuts, respecs

[3:38:24] aerodynam1c: barrens is so sick
[3:38:28] andyjamesgames: @nathanew321 okay so having dual spec more accessible is good for pvp
[3:38:45] peepoAdmin: yea, that's what I do tbh
[3:38:50] Frayeen: I wish we had dual spec
[3:38:51] heroesofnewworld: SeemsGood
[3:38:53] Etsku: i cant afford 10 gold jesus
[3:38:56] Duppylol: price elasticity
[3:39:07] einself111: still way to much if you play a hybrid class that still sucks
[3:39:11] Sourr09: good morning! how goes the box grind
[3:39:14] einself111: we need dual spec
[3:39:34] EffinsTV: keep 50g respec, but add dual spec, ofc
[3:39:43] jimzi707: how do i ban my friends who keep buying gold
[3:39:48] OrganikCum: still hoping for dual spec in p2, doubt it though since it wasnt datamined
[3:39:58] Deamp: chronoboon good goldsink, but they soo cheap on sod
[3:40:02] Sourr09: hell yeah
[3:40:12] Etsku: 2more spot on the bandage spot and healthstone
[3:40:29] psircyen: is there a fresh start server for p2
[3:40:29] andyjamesgames: add the barbershop. really good good sink.
[3:40:31] crispytheaussie: skills, repairs, AH cut, flight paths
[3:40:35] einself111: these "gold sinks" only hurt non gold buyers LUL
[3:40:38] ziizutv: do we know the amount of xp for boxes?
[3:40:38] damptas: auction house cut
[3:40:40] maldemer_: AH tax
[3:40:43] ummish: add vendors for plaguebloom and gromsblood etc for like 3g per piece

[3:40:46] Arawnik: reagents
[3:40:48] aerodynam1c: flight piaths
[3:40:48] AxelFromAustralia: @staysafetv is there any reason why I should put more than own talent point into Improved corruption? 1 global is 1global
[3:41:01] andyjamesgames: barbershop
[3:41:04] CarsInTheSky: profession reagents like vials
[3:41:12] Etsku: i never buy food or water i make mages give me
[3:41:37] Kayneinunit: i would reroll another toon everytime i wanted to respec if it were ever more than 10g
[3:41:44] AxelFromAustralia: didn’t think of that
[3:41:51] AxelFromAustralia: so 1 point or 5 points basically
[3:42:07] BigChoobs: you havent had a pet for a while
[3:42:16] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k

[3:42:36] maldemer_: mutilate phase2 only 40energy?
[3:42:41] thepenitentthief: respec gold is good for immersion... world identity... but if the game is desperate for players to play all aspects of the game then yeah removing it is good
[3:42:43] psircyen: any fresh server for p2?
[3:42:49] Ebsoni: 12pm
[3:42:53] ticeyx: 5pm
[3:43:07] BigChoobs: @StaysafeTV youre playin without a pet

[3:44:07] einself111: me
[3:44:12] einself111: my wl alt
[3:44:14] Kayneinunit: i respec on my warlock so much it's already up to 1g and i hate it
[3:44:21] Humansoup: Me when I play
[3:44:21] stankypanky22: whats the reason for not doing a quick bfd?
[3:44:32] Marksman91: i solo as mage
[3:44:32] Kayneinunit: but yeah definitely sod
[3:44:50] CaerToo: When you have bronze bars and leather in bags and find those crates..
[3:44:50] crispytheaussie: why you not just grab the buffs with the blood shards on way back, just a little bonus
[3:44:58] ticeyx: im considering soloing it, it depends if my 5man gets a healer, my alt lock ill be soloing 100% though
[3:45:08] MrPancakxs: If you have a good bfd group you can clear sub 20-25m easily
[3:45:19] BigChoobs: a good guild group could clear it in like 15-20 min
[3:45:25] Goldbowser: how many boxes are we at ?
[3:45:28] Kayneinunit: i was soloing stockades on my lock earlier today for gold ill probably do that the first day of p2
[3:46:03] originmorii: @Kayneinunit are you doing that just for vendor trash or what?
[3:46:10] MrPancakxs: you prequest first then run bfd
[3:46:15] ziizutv: darna start with port from BFD
[3:46:15] AxelFromAustralia: can you explain the Mana part of Improved drain soul? I don’t understand the wording.
[3:46:20] Alexx__HC: is valentine event supposed to start today? for the chocolate consumables?
[3:46:24] Kayneinunit: vendor trash, greens, blue BoEs and cloth
[3:46:46] ziizutv: just BFD start raidq handin in Darna, port to menethil easy
[3:47:00] SupreemLeeder11: CoolStoryBob and thats assuming all goes well and you dont get a band of retards
[3:47:08] Manxkaffee: Getting to level 26 with a mage before doing bfd, so you finally do some damage
[3:47:08] crispytheaussie: as alliance 100%, because you can proit to darn after for your hand ins
[3:47:20] eqizz: @StaysafeTV some people are saying that since its 'completion' they wer going to preclear it day before and then finish it
[3:47:42] letsgetgoingyo: where do you set your hearth?
[3:47:48] ticeyx: i dont really wanna do BFD honestly, i have a hard time trusting 9 people to do something when time matters, i can already hear people crying for summons and shit
[3:47:58] originmorii: 5Head hmm yes, indubitably
[3:48:16] chrizzo1988: can you show me pls your list at which level which dungeon you will go?
[3:48:35] ticeyx: just a note to all you non warlocks btw, you are all terrible with summons in SoD, this is the worst i have ever seen with crying for summons and not helping summon
[3:48:44] Goldbowser: @ticeyx fully agree.  BIS is going solo. dungeon or open world
[3:49:05] chrizzo1988: thx
[3:49:28] originmorii: so have you decided on whether or not you want improved imp?
[3:49:33] Goldbowser: what xp/hour are you expecting in RFK ?
[3:49:40] amgains: I’ve gotten 105 waylaid supply chests from gnolls in redridge
[3:49:58] crispytheaussie: you would want to do it when your at the highest exp per hour, probably end of library
[3:50:06] tharessz: Do you know staysafe if the 5% dmg buff will work at 40?
[3:50:09] ticeyx: bis might be solo but part of the idea of 5maning is to get tanks and healers max level as fast as possible, my plan is to login and not sleep until clearing gnomer
[3:50:13] Sourr09: probably just feel it out after every first run and pop it from there if you feel it’s needed
[3:50:14] dj_clerik: Maybe the first run of SM? That’ll probably be when you need it most @staysafetv
[3:50:14] einself111: did you already do the escort quest in rfk ?
[3:50:21] eqizz: no one else thinks that its just going to be xp given at the end of BFD instead of pure bosses like they did on retail?
[3:50:42] Etsku: i cant wait to run to SM on alliance
[3:50:51] Kayneinunit: what are all those boxes in your inv
[3:50:53] crispytheaussie: probably the hit rating
[3:51:03] Joxtirol: aren't armory have log out skip?
[3:51:38] reavethederp: do you ever talk to esfand anymore
[3:51:40] BigChoobs: theres lvl 40 mobs in cathedral, if you start at 37. yjru
[3:51:45] Kaizoo: will solo grind rfk as lock be value?
[3:51:45] BigChoobs: they'll be orange

[3:55:09] therealogw: how fast do you think we will see the first 40?
[3:55:28] BigChoobs: might be like 50k
[3:55:33] originmorii: what runes are you going?
[3:55:34] MrPancakxs: @therealogw within 24 hours lol
[3:55:55] Kayneinunit: i saw a spreadsheet that one guy planning to get it done with 8 ish hours
[3:55:58] CookieClickerLegend: youre going for first warlock though lol
[3:56:12] Bobby_NPM: so whats your break point on bfd, if its bugged and giving say 100k will you rush to go?
[3:56:16] DeadlyRaiderArmy: Remember to always drink water and stay awesome :)
[3:56:55] Arawnik: @thepenitentthief your real identity is your class. and if you want to go more specific than that, its up to you. shouldn't be a case of paying to unlock other parts of your skillset LUL
[3:57:03] firnal: Bed is nice
[3:57:10] SupreemLeeder11: YEP world first is your way of saying, "I'm a no-lifer"
[3:57:14] Nille4mat: @StaysafeTV The new waylaid supplies system looks cool, too bad the current supplies will be removed when P2 launches :(
[3:57:39] lethalkingr: guys which 3 dps do you believe will shine in phase 2?
[3:58:00] marsj0: What if you start by login at quest turnin, summoned to bfd, hs to questing grind loc
[3:58:03] Etsku: chat?
[3:58:11] SupreemLeeder11: NODDERS wise, too many retards
[3:58:16] Kayneinunit: warlocks, hunters, and shammies
[3:58:18] Sourr09: what if the meta is like 5-8 manning BFD, km curious if that xp turnout is worth it
[3:58:31] iamlucas__: !whatif
[3:58:31] Nightbot: Pepega WHAT IF...
[3:59:07] lethalkingr: @kayneinunit everyone says warrior rogue hunter :p
[3:59:12] amgains: will the old waylaid supplies be deleted at launch?
[3:59:21] Sourr09: yeah makes sense
[3:59:22] SAOxSIN: @StaysafeTV someone told me a blizz dev said those WSG tokens will be hugely nerfed for exp turn in to the point that it won't be worth it  - did you hear that?
[3:59:31] AxelFromAustralia: Staysafe the king of answering what ifs 😂

[8:07:57] ungodlyxdx: @125christian125 I don't live in a bubble at all, I live on the same planet you do, you just live in a part of the world where the rates I spoke of have not influenced
[8:08:03] TheSanguist: What's strange is that the current societal norms are being driven by people who never had to live without the Internet.  So, there is a missing element of humanity which would have come from actually interacting with life.  Now they view it through filtered algorithms telling them what to do and how to think.

[8:08:44] ungodlyxdx: @StaysafeTV Genetic tech/therapy is drastically dropping on cost and will at some point become standard of care. For example, sequencing the human genome cost 10s of thousands of dollars at teh beginning of the century, now you can do it for hundreds
[8:08:46] 13deadace1: Nah we aren't even close to that bs
[8:08:46] Jalapinot: Countries will be forced to allow genetic modifying fetuses. To ban it is to allow other countries babies to be smarter, stronger, etc
[8:08:52] TheSanguist: Separating people makes them easier to rule.

[8:44:02] Sequisha: you see the threat of taxation for growing your own crops, due to increased carbon footprint?
[8:44:03] zmrd77: land is difficult imo, because banks dont lend money for land purchase, so its cash transaction only, limited group who can afford this. Imo not that great investment, better buy apt to rent out

[8:51:04] DaveTheDoc: @AintFinnaSubscribe Yeah, cant live in fear for sure. I just finished Peter Zeihan's recent book on world powers in a post globalization world and its just kind of wild how gold is basically immune to financial disasters. And how places like Japan, Sweden, France, New Zealand, and the U.S. are probably the best options to live. FeelsOkayMan

[8:52:54] the_noodler__: my friend would walk home with my 2-week paychekc every 3 days working in an executive's club... shit was crazy.
[8:52:56] shoehorn_oh_plenty: pitting the workers against eachother feelsgoodman
[8:53:05] KCYON: the group mentality would be rough there yeah

[8:53:45] dojalol: i really enjoy your streams ty ss !
[8:53:47] Mauraderss: staysafe why is the tipping option more common in almost all retail settings? not just food industry
[8:53:50] ChillyHTX: do waiters in ur state make min wage + tips? cuz here its 2.25/hr and tips
[8:53:53] Winky: i was working 4 days a month making like 2k in highschool haha
[8:54:02] the_noodler__: depends on the state a tip-wage state i wouldnt.. but in places like CA where u are required to pay state minimum wage, i would.

[8:54:51] 13deadace1: Just tip a little
[8:54:54] Wingsofjanitor: YEP I used to be able to get a large order of teriyaki chicken at my local place for like $9 now it's more like $14 but they're still chugging away
[8:54:54] Romanowski: @staysafetv I travel so much internationally that I basically have gotten accustomed to never tipping. Because of that I barely go out to restaurants anymore when I'm in NA. This tipping has gotten way too much out of hand
[8:54:55] dtl78: gotta keep up with the Jones'

[8:57:21] Romanowski: Nowadays they expect a tip for takeaway. What the f***? You're not even serving me. Nope
[8:57:28] LittlefootsTreestar: @StaysafeTV what about tipping if you order food online and pick it up.  then they ask for a tp when you pay/pickup
[8:57:29] AintFinnaSubscribe: jk don't tip we don't do that in sweden
[8:57:40] xlineagefreek: IF your easy to deal with a respectful young kid that doesnt tip its all good, but if your high maintenance and rude and dont tip thats a special place in hell lol

[8:58:37] thaatgoodgood: lol get your own food then
[8:58:38] dreadd39: seeing those vids of them saying something about the tip makes me want to order and not tip
[8:58:39] Mauraderss: you don’t tip delivery, your food likely won’t show up
[8:58:39] helmetnach0s: tipping before you’ve been served is the most retarded US bullshit
[8:58:42] Tslater01: Tslater01 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak!

[8:59:02] dirbagdan: I complain and get free food when that happens
[8:59:04] clamthenerd: and they should want you to tip them in cash instead of on the app, but these low IQ drivers don't know that
[8:59:06] helmetnach0s: only you winky
[8:59:07] fviii: @Winky LOLW
[8:59:07] Denakina: they actually ask for a 2nd tip...
[8:59:07] KShellZx: tipping before my food arrives does not make sense
[8:59:10] KCYON: i ordered oreos once (dont ask) and some dude brought me home made cookies

[8:59:13] dirbagdan: I go full Karen and don’t care lmao

[8:59:31] Romanowski: I once got a speeding ticket and a cop asked for a 15% tip. KappaHD
[8:59:39] Lee859: well doordash pays them next to nothing, it just covers gas. They need to make money so they want to take an order thats worth their time.
[8:59:39] coeursiy: and this is why the agricultural revolution was a mistake
[8:59:40] Mauraderss: you feel obligated to tip so your food doesn’t show up half eaten or full of spit

[8:59:49] Humansoup: I just don't use it anymore I cook at home with Food I grow
[8:59:50] Wrettchh: i managed a jimmy johns it was the opposite. if you tipped beforehand, drivers would deliver it last and try to get to the others quickly for a better tip lol
[8:59:52] helmetnach0s: I only tip the doctor who pulverizes my kidney stones
[8:59:54] Ekkyb: @StaysafeTV you've become my new favorite background audio
[8:59:56] stunn4: i cant understand why tipping is almost mandatory? like in deliver what are u tipping for? that the food arrived on time?
[8:59:59] peepopoope69: no the tip exists so business owners can save money, how else are they supposed to have another summer home? oy vey

[9:00:09] Buttsworth: wasn't tipping caused by slavery
[9:00:09] Lee859: I did doordash a few times when i was hurting for cash... did a 1 hour delivery round trip... made 8 bucks. not worth it.
