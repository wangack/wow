[0:57:22] Sashenka018: Same
[0:57:23] cptnraz: Blizzard is not known for inovating but they are known for making stuff better and more smooth. The thing is every single MMO i try I just wish it was as "smooth" as WoW in movement and spells etc.
[0:57:24] alextheblight: chromie time
[0:57:25] Asmii: you need full addons and stuff for classic but retail has like a hand holder at the start at least
[0:57:25] 21bender21: any xpac u want
[0:57:27] LeeshDK: same
[0:57:29] Trexbo_: Well intro wise Retail does it better
[0:57:29] HelluvaWrecks: too much is thrown at you as a new player in ratial, classic is much slower
[0:57:33] xelm_: seems like an infinite amount of crafting and endless grinds.
[0:57:34] mordiell: you do SL i think
[0:57:35] HumblePhil: 100% even as an experienced player classic is still easier that retail. I have no clue how to do professions
[0:57:36] mordiell: no
[0:57:37] LuminescentLlama: first time experience of wow is bis
[0:57:42] mordiell: as a starter you cant do any expansion
[0:57:43] 21bender21: i got ya. the chromie thing iis a bit confusing
[0:57:44] LuminescentLlama: wish i was learning it again for first time
[0:57:45] Chlamydious: i prefer retail personally but yeah its a bit much
[0:57:50] Horfent: On a brand new account you are forced to go through BFA expansion for lvling if i remember correctly
[0:57:50] Zornator: classic you have 3 button rota, retail 10+
[0:57:50] 21Khal: @mordiell BFA
[0:57:52] kissyougoodnight: retail is for genz and so on not for us
[0:57:52] alextheblight: the real overwhelming shit starts when you hit max

[0:57:55] harpdarp: Lvl 1 retail too hard KEKW
[0:57:57] Gillettefuzionz: @mordiell it definitely isnt shadowlands for a starter
[0:58:00] Lappi_Koski: i never understood why in retail the default dungeon is only BFA dungeons
[0:58:01] Kaizeer: in retail they hold your hand through the quests no worries
[0:58:03] mordiell: chromie time is for players with more experience, new players cannot choose
[0:58:06] mediana91: and you have to pick a timeline and expansion and zone etc etc
[0:58:06] iscarrs: Bernardo Silva left man city and play wow

[0:58:53] zenniik: i mean first time they you make a character they do give you a questline
[0:58:56] banshay3: why is the action bar floating? LUL
[0:58:58] Zielepoot: Dragonflight has no character progression.

[1:06:58] Nada_Smurf: imagine 40man molten core for months...yikes
[1:06:59] Trexbo_: I only started classic because of Hardcore and it was motivating to hit 60
[1:06:59] grvywow: classic endgame isnt about the content, its about the people you do it with.
[1:06:59] BisAndTris: u get to the point of raid logging VERY quickly
[1:07:00] OniiDante: @mothwhowearslippers lucky you, i spent a whole $40 for the expansion and didnt even hit max level because i got bored so fast
[1:07:03] endful__: imagine keys on classic raids and dungeons
[1:07:03] xelm_: true.
[1:07:05] Kaizeer: getting purps is fun tho

[1:07:29] LuminescentLlama: NPCing its about the journey
[1:07:32] xAlastor89: people wanna load in and gear up
[1:07:32] ddevillax: what u should do is get a 40 man raid with zandalari wand so u dont do the blood moon and then during the blood moon try to kill kha'damu
[1:07:33] GamingWithPaulito: !plater

[1:11:33] vaultec_: i was a warrior with half a t0 set, one t1 piece and halberd of smiting from ZG. probably did double digit dps back then. OkayMan
[1:11:34] Temporaldoom: but there are gear catch up mechanics, you don't have to do each phase gear fresh 80
[1:11:36] mordiell: if only there was a title of it in the corner
[1:11:44] Zornator: minmax the fun out of it
[1:11:52] xAlastor89: still didnt fix the dragon animations LUL
[1:12:08] 21bender21: the sweat lvl of min maxing for me was always directly reciprocal to a new person saying . "wait you're not using simcraft/raider.io etc." and learning

[1:12:59] LabyrinthMW: @m1cke90 As in doing them in the order they were released in over the years?
[1:13:04] OniiDante: im just like this i hit max level i start getting bored
[1:13:04] HappyPorcupine: I don't play a lot of endgame either
[1:13:10] xAlastor89: well thats why you rather should play singleplayer rpg instead of mmo gear treadmills
[1:13:16] Rezoix: @LabyrinthMW YEP
[1:13:18] DINGODOGGERDUDE: @bubbleznchaos no

[1:13:59] mordiell: its not really random tbf
[1:14:01] wtfblub: retail story is fucked
[1:14:02] ashtaroxx: plink not very immersive
[1:14:03] sam3255: dont need to do bfa LUL
[1:14:04] Fakeswap: no longer required afaik
[1:14:04] TheLightKnight: he's new. he doesn't know about chromie
[1:14:07] xAlastor89: I thought they made it so you can select to level in any expansion you want
[1:14:09] mordiell: it has more to do with lore atm than classic lore
[1:14:10] sam3255: this dude is just lost asf
[1:14:11] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:14:14] Durenas: if anyone has a solution to this problem that doesn't introduce more problems, i'd love to hear it
[1:14:14] BALtaram: its the expansion that explains the current story the best
[1:14:14] Rezoix: @sam3255 I think the first character is forced to do bfa
[1:14:19] Tibainium: there is a reason retail WoW sells you raid ready boosts
[1:14:23] Foodlebar: new players cant do chromie time
[1:14:25] cendaiii: its more recent storywise, "classic" retail doesnt make sense when you end up fighting the jailer etc
[1:14:25] wtfblub: you cant do chromie as a new player
[1:14:26] MysticRaven_: i think they changing it to dragonflight you have to do when next xpac come sout
[1:14:27] stevey221: ugh the way movement is in retail is the reason i wont play.. humans move like Bananacatrun
[1:14:27] sneezyl: you cannot talk to chromie on your first character i believe
[1:14:28] Lappi_Koski: you can talk to chromie and pick cataclysm to stay in the normal world
[1:14:30] yoloryebread: Yeah I always timewalk on retail
[1:14:31] Foodlebar: they are forced to level through bfa first
[1:14:31] Yaabbuu: wow has lore?
[1:14:35] Yaabbuu: EleGiggle
[1:14:37] maxburty: they're gunna make dragonflight the new player leveling experience once TWW comes out, which makes a bit more sense i think?
[1:14:38] mordiell: @Lappi_Koski not as starter
[1:14:38] Jazminite: he talks about chromie later
[1:14:39] kwalahsmash: retail is so bloated
[1:14:40] DasWombat: you have to do bfa with one char
[1:14:46] Trexbo_: I mean BfA is kinda required for the current game lore, you need the context to keep playing IMO Shruge
[1:14:51] xelm_: retail gold is worth less than the lint in your pocket.

[1:40:20] Voodookitten0313: I’ve always accepted things for what they are. WoW has been around for so long that if you don’t want to do some research into its lore as a new player youre doing your self a disservice and not giving what’s already there a chance. so thats why I feel videos like these are annoying. anyway it’s just an opinion. Every one is allowed to have one.

The one advantage that a Silverback might have is the enormous strength of its muscles. While grizzlies are immensely strong, gorillas, chimps, and monkeys have much greater muscle strength than other animals of a similar size. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
