[1:06:56] SeeStrong: I've enjoyed the time i've put in to BG3 but I stopped as I'm going to create a new character at full release
[1:07:00] Jarlan23: thats cool yeah i like turn based rpgs too
[1:07:03] JoshuaTree6969: its 36 hours of voice acting

[1:11:38] SeeStrong: lol yeah I never used her
[1:11:54] SeeStrong: I never played the OG FF7 but the Remake was amazing
[1:12:06] Jarlan23: its something like ultimate armor you put that on her and then the speed boots and rings
[1:12:17] Jarlan23: she never dies and she already has high magic defense
[1:12:22] Jarlan23: its just her damage that sucks
[1:12:43] Dallas20_: The OG was so good. I loved grinding and maxing out like STR stats on Cloud then one shot everything
[1:14:09] Jarlan23: yeah ff7 and legend of dragoon were my games as a kid

[1:18:11] PensPrez: Monolift Soft is well known for good story, good combat and good music
[1:18:12] mavericks312: i also think turn based jrps are a thing of the past as well
[1:18:21] Jarlan23: i was always surprised no one ever took the quicktime/combo system from  legend of dragoon
[1:18:30] Jarlan23: seemed like a good way to keep turnbased combat interesting
[1:18:50] SeeStrong: That system was fantastic
[1:18:56] SeeStrong: loved the combat system for that game
[1:19:12] Affiiance: Morning hammer squad towHAMUP

[1:19:39] OhNoNotAgain: I liked taking milk and mixing the strawberry shortcake with it.
[1:19:45] Affiiance: So Aug made it through the reset without a nerf?
[1:20:00] Jarlan23: the new dragon quest was good
[1:20:01] mavericks312: casue the new gamers only care about fps games
[1:20:04] Jarlan23: has that old school feel to it
[1:20:40] herzlustafir: i liked it
[1:20:42] mavericks312: younger gamers are all hoped up on adderall can handle slow games
[1:20:46] herzlustafir: 7 was good
[1:20:48] Rottencoarse: https://twitter.com/Naowhxd/status/1686450244408459264 from naowh :)
[1:21:13] Jarlan23: and i know people hated it but ffx-2 had good turnbased but fast paced combat in it
[1:21:24] Jarlan23: but i havent played that again since it released
[1:21:30] zysmos: lmao people are mad
[1:21:33] Affiiance: Aug is so much fun to play too
[1:21:48] Nebulizer87: to be fair he specifically searched for Aug
[1:21:54] zysmos: +15 are so easy tho
[1:21:54] ElmSpace: That 15 invited Naowh as ret
[1:21:56] mavericks312: i will say the change from turnbased combat was needed
[1:21:58] Molvonos: I'm useful
[1:21:59] Molvonos: lol
[1:22:05] Affiiance: They need to turn Mistweaver into support spec
[1:22:14] Baldarsar: @Towelliee yeah it looks fucking amazing FF7 Remake but the new action controlls i dont really like it that much FF needs to be round based :)

[1:22:20] RoboMaximillion: holy
[1:22:26] Syllvn: Aug is the BEST thing to show you just how crazy the Meta info permeates trhough all the layers of the game, even when it's not important.
[1:22:47] chriswrites: i am 435 and i am not accepted into anything beyond a 14
[1:22:52] Jarlan23: yeah i play dps warrior 446 2700 io im getting declined to 17s
[1:22:59] Jarlan23: and it happens constantly
[1:23:02] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I hit 3k as ret this season and 70% of my time pushing has been in LFG simulator :(
[1:23:26] Affiiance: 1Tank, 1 Healer, 2 DPS, 1 Sup in dungeons sounds good to me
[1:23:31] Nebulizer87: i think aug needs to be subpar, so a casual can play it cuz its the simplest class but it shouldn't be taken into high end content
[1:23:39] The_L_e_o_n: Hey @Towelliee !! You are THE BEST ! BILLIONS OF VIEWS !!!
[1:23:42] Molvonos: @Nebulizer87 What is this hottake?

[1:24:37] Yagr6: blizz is failing class balance

[1:25:08] Luddite396: Congrats, man!
[1:25:26] LynkGX: Ozempic? LUL
[1:25:28] Jarlan23: @Affiiance fire mage in my group isnt sold on them yet
[1:25:31] Jarlan23: 10 mins
[1:25:33] Yagr6: the problem is if u aint aug, shadow, or mage u not getting invited
[1:25:39] sickboyz: 10 min
[1:25:40] Ezcotli: LUL
[1:25:41] QuigsTV: @Towelliee 10 min
[1:26:04] tonyr23: Let's see you do the trial of styles üòâ  today
[1:26:08] chriswrites: semiglutide is the medication type, ozempic is the product name :) \
[1:26:10] Affiiance: Guardian Druid is the most busted imo
[1:26:17] chriswrites: think of it like tylenol vs acetaminophem
[1:26:24] Affiiance: Can‚Äôt do certain pills without Guardian
[1:26:25] Yagr6: i would argue blizz is failing class balance atm
[1:26:31] QuigsTV: @Towelliee the tmog toy cd is 10 minsa
[1:26:32] Baldarsar: @QuigsTV yeah but you can use the mount all the time, the only reason for toy is that you can use it in raid and so
[1:26:33] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[1:26:40] Molvonos: @Yagr6 You've already said that.
[1:26:48] MaySaveYou: I get into keys pretty easy on my prot warrior.
[1:26:56] Meliea_EU: they got tradepost currency in shop, neat
[1:27:00] Molvonos: They're not failing class balance, they're trying something new, which is a very distinct difference.
[1:27:15] LeXieSterling: I was wondering on that mount token. Would it drop the rocket? Since it drops in a dungeon.
[1:27:23] Sylphy_TV: there are so many pets
[1:27:24] Yagr6: @Molvonos ban me
[1:27:26] M1ME: When I watch this game I withdrawal, how is the new expansion honestly
[1:27:33] Molvonos: @Yagr6 I mean, I can if you want.
[1:27:34] Affiiance: My only hope is the don‚Äôt nerf Aug into oblivion
[1:27:36] SinicalDev: The game is totally different when you're not pugging tbh, our guild does tons of 20+ keys a week with all comps
[1:27:38] Jarlan23: gotta wait till dragonflying is in every zone
[1:27:42] hisfrankness: Do you keep a favorite pet out?
[1:27:44] QuigsTV: Also you can get 3 of the same pet most of the time
[1:27:49] Meliea_EU: tradepost is overkill this month, got not enough currency
[1:28:11] Jarlan23: i like egbert because he runs around everywhere

Healer instantly went "not to be elitist, but I don't have time for people who don't know the dungeon that has been out since exp cam out" and left. I swear people have ZERO patience anymore

[1:33:27] flookguy: Can you use Wowup and curseforge simultaneously or would I need to reinstall everything from curseforge and lost like my weakauras?
[1:33:28] Meliea_EU: @acebrown24 people got different taste, i like retail and classic
[1:33:33] Cello_73: @Towelliee what monitors do you use for gaming?
[1:33:45] 91Niki: @Bayne77 Yep. I even whispered them after to be like "hey not the coolest take. maybe the tank was a new player" and they were like "i did an act of kindness by letting them know, might have been a rough one, but it was kind" ... Im like WHAT LUL

[1:35:12] 91Niki: The toxic healer in my hc dungeon was from moonguard too. Poor guy was probably being held up in a hc dungeon, when he could be rping .

[1:35:40] kochiee: :) *
[1:35:53] acebrown24: I mean retail is so difficult for new players
[1:35:54] Molvonos: I got my leggo, time to carry
[1:36:00] acebrown24: To understand
[1:36:01] tr4ncetv: @acebrown24 well not you just trolling if you say Cata is your fav
[1:36:08] Thoreya: "a lot of people" aka prob asmon bc everything he says is gospel apparently
[1:36:14] 91Niki: Anyway Towelliee, don't ever invite Keokeo-MoonGuard. That was the healer in my hc dungeon that had zero patience
[1:36:18] acebrown24: No I'm not
[1:36:25] tr4ncetv: "a lot of people" aka reddit (see D4)
[1:36:34] acebrown24: Cata mop legion

[1:53:06] Toojicle: @Rottencoarse Let's not generalize here lol
[1:53:12] darkrowse21: like ESO
[1:53:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: they dont have it in game because it would have to share the profit from it with the console companys
[1:53:19] LeXieSterling: Right... It very simple. If you don't like it stop playing. Leave the rest of us alone who collect and are grown enough to be able to spend our dollars any way we want.
[1:53:31] jbmoongirl: I don‚Äôt understand the anger over the store. It‚Äôs all cosmetic stuff. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it! Simple..end of discussion.
[1:53:51] Noshpan: To be fair, there's a lot of complaints about the items sold on the Mog Station
[1:53:58] Toojicle: @LeXieSterling I still don't know how this isn't the norm. Do people not understand disposable income?
[1:54:06] flookguy: I mean idgaf about mounts or pets but I have an alt gearing addiction and therefore have a wow token addiction haha
[1:54:13] Eliman101: I agree cosmetic stuff is fine it‚Äôs whatever but WoW does have the option to buy gold now which is not great but it is expensive for how much you get so

[1:56:05] Zenzhal: People forget that you couldnt even find the freaking download button to the game without jumping through 15 hoops.. they think they know how to implement a good store? LUL
[1:56:21] Toojicle: They NEED to be angry or what else do they talk about when mounts go in store?

[1:57:12] Firehoshi: the items do look cute though, tenders just extra XD
[1:57:12] Exodeo_: same thing for people telling others to unsub lol
[1:57:21] ashwing_: but you are encouraging bad practices and stuff that ppl tell themselves KEKW

[1:57:40] DunzoCD: everything nickel and dimes you nowadays like it or not
[1:57:53] RagingBeardedScot: They think validation comes with feeling passionately enough to bitch about something.  Which probably at one point was true, but now its just led to people always bitching about everything.
[1:58:01] smashwow: i mean hell DAO had a "store" and that was a single player game
[1:58:02] Eshel: Or as my dad would say - ‚Äúthey‚Äôd bitch if you hung them with a new rope‚Äù
[1:58:14] homegift: how does a 5 dollars cosmetic item affects your enjoyment of a game? people just wanna be mad about something related to WoW ResidentSleeper
[1:58:23] RagingBeardedScot: @Eshel your father was a wise man
[1:58:43] falldrgn: who gives a fuck. get your bag..
[1:58:47] smashwow: @homegift people mad about the tenders being attached to the shop item.

[1:59:10] Toojicle: Do people really think Blizzard could pay any content creator more than what they make through YouTube/Twitch? lol
[1:59:33] SinicalDev: I think theres a bonus for doing trial of style?
[1:59:52] smashwow: asking for a friend here's my credit card info Kappa @Towelliee

[2:00:17] Eshel: Know what would be perfect? Next week they drop the price to $3 - watch the argument change to ‚ÄúI spent $5 - I want my $2 refund !!!!!‚Äù - lol
[2:00:36] MrTheColor9: is now a good time to get backi into wow?
[2:00:50] YungshrimpXD: rough fight like for me when i healed this undergeared Kappa
[2:01:06] Snabido: Cosmetic = power, in some peoples mind CoolCat
[2:01:20] DunzoCD: thatd be like putting tier tokens in the store or something
[2:01:21] robertjordan83: @Towelliee part of the problem is they are triple dipping: box price, sub, and not cosmetics
[2:01:27] homegift: @smashwow i understand but how does a tender affects ilvl, gear, etc as Tow is mentioning. tender is cosmetic :/
[2:01:32] QuigsTV: @Towelliee wow token could be the only thing close to it. But it really isnt
[2:01:37] mavericks312: That an ppl see bellular speak out against it
[2:01:42] Exodeo_: I'm still expecting the world to burn if spectral tiger becomes a drop or store item ;p
[2:01:55] alluza: but having cooler cosmetings increases your dps by 100% so thats alredy thing =P
[2:02:00] tlsmith3638: Lil XT  has a buildt in toy train smasher it was a insta buy in WotLK
[2:02:05] Eshel: ‚ÄúI need to win the fashion show!! It‚Äôs pay to win!!‚Äù I‚Äôm sure is what someone is thinking
[2:02:11] Noshpan: I remember when they first started selling mounts & pets & there was a lot of complaints that the store mounts gave people an unfair advantage LUL
[2:02:19] Sukodin: @Towelliee but I wana be outraged!
[2:02:23] tlsmith3638: it improved my gameplay 1000%

[2:02:49] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I love collecting mounts but at the end of the day its all cosmetic
[2:02:54] Effin_Steffin: it's not like you HAVE to get the trading post mounts and shit either. You don't like it just save your points for next month
[2:03:06] silversoidier: What about adding a reroll tokens in the store. Could be used for any xpac content
[2:03:06] Thoreya: its absolutely wild to me how ppl are still flabbergasted about the shop when they added char services in 2008, its been a while man
[2:03:07] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:03:16] smashwow: @smashwow oh it doesn't. the concern is if they would take X and do Y with it, what does that mean for future things. and yeah it can definitely be a red flag. but it's not currently causing issues.
[2:03:29] HaloS23: It‚Äôs a hell of a game just to be a collector!!!

[2:03:56] Thoreya: lol tryna farm easy likes smh
[2:04:27] Toojicle: I think we need to get to a point where we don't argue with them anymore.
[2:04:27] akia03: didnt he say significant bundles tho
[2:04:34] Eshel: Seen a post earlier someone was saying the word ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù was the problem lmao
[2:04:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Doesn't mean I have to agree with the decision
[2:05:01] Eshel: ‚ÄúThe wrist mog is not substantial‚Äù boo hoo
[2:05:04] PotbellyGoat: how close are we to the Legacy Collection rips?
[2:05:06] ElroenFlyrow: @Towelliee There is a term called "reading comprehension ". Some dont have it or have reallly short memory... I`ll suggest they go read some books :P and cool off
[2:05:39] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee And people wonder why Devs shutdown communicating after they make a commitment to start communicating when stuff like this happens.
[2:05:46] mattack10: It comes down to people just want thinks to cry about, if you don't like it don't play the game.
[2:05:51] Eshel: @flyrowi  If those kids could read they‚Äôd be really upset right now lol
[2:06:00] digitoxity: substantial significant certain certainty

[2:06:27] BarthelemeusNL: did you say account wide rep for wow or a other game?
[2:06:46] Toojicle: Yup. It's really the SMALLEST minority that are so fucking loud man
[2:06:48] Exodeo_: they're already playing WoW lol
[2:07:25] Molvonos: Real LFR Heeerooooosss
[2:07:25] Eshel: They‚Äôre the same people who would remind the teacher about homework and the rest of the class is just ‚Äústfu!!!!‚Äù
[2:07:33] Molvonos: I need to make a video parody of that
[2:07:49] flookguy: I just don‚Äôt understand it. Games massive. You aren‚Äôt going to own everything so why sweat it. Just fucking play the game
[2:08:13] Arocian: lol
[2:08:30] Wcvechten: I'm the kind of person who would buy it just to spite them
[2:08:31] flookguy: There‚Äôs always needs to be a victim or victims
[2:09:07] xziyn: You guys still defending billion dollars companies's greed lol. There's now way y'all don't see why people have a problem with this, even though it was obvious it was gonna happen.

[2:09:19] abracka_: 30 minute video, 28 minutes of them just talking about nonsense
[2:09:21] Toojicle: Which is CRAZY. Why do gamers have an agenda to hate every game, when playing video games is their hobby?
[2:09:26] Eshel: $5 bundle - WoW is dead game
[2:09:54] Necoc: yeah must be nice having no principles LUL

[2:10:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: i told youtube to stop recommending his shit to me years ago
[2:10:29] Toojicle: @xziyn They are a company. Huh?
[2:10:44] 91Niki: Like do you understand how a business work ?? LUL
[2:10:44] Arocian: yep
[2:10:45] tlsmith3638: which is the whole point of a company
[2:10:45] jkitchin75: @xziyn jog on
[2:10:50] Arocian: its a business, confirmed
[2:10:52] chriswrites: people on twitter shitting on blizzad and defending elon musk on the same timelines lmao
[2:11:03] ElroenFlyrow: @Toojicle Because they are shortsighted. And think of their immediate income from viewers and don't think about the dmg they are doing to the games that made them "famous" and give them content to begin with.
[2:11:04] geokouts: and i thought Blizzard is a Charity and not a Company...
[2:11:16] Eshel: Can you believe McDonalds is charging for hamburgers? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to profit from their product!! I say we riot !!! /s
[2:11:16] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:11:25] Kundersmack: But if I don't buy it and my friends do then they will laugh at me
[2:11:27] Toojicle: @Flyrowi What damage? Gamers are still playing the same games?
[2:11:48] 91Niki: "How dare they try to make more money"
[2:11:50] Arocian: and the best part, you don't like it, don't spend your money. No one is being forced to buy the extra's lol
[2:11:58] flookguy: You don‚Äôt have to buy it. I don‚Äôt understand why people get so butt hurt
[2:11:58] ashwing_: Damage KEKW They spitting out content for WoW like a machine this expansion and my guy saying damange
[2:12:04] skewlbeta: Companies exist to make money. If they didn't want to make money, they wouldn't be in business. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be ethical, but putting 200 tendies on the store with some corsages is not the hill to die on
[2:12:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: do you realize it cost money to make my car go vroom vroom, I already paid for the car wtf do i have to keep pumping money into it Kappa
[2:12:14] ElroenFlyrow: @Toojicle Lets say a player wanna try WoW, or come back to it, etc. They check these big youtubers first, and usually let it define their opinion
[2:12:14] xziyn: @91Niki I do, and I'm not surprised at Blizzard's move, nor do I care about it, but I completely get why people get pissed at seeing tenders in the store.
[2:12:31] danoh_64: seems like people would understand this by now. its only been what 15 years?
[2:12:35] Quojin: @Kundersmack thats a chinese//korean attitude
[2:12:37] SamuraiWillZ916: what is your line?
[2:12:40] Eshel: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it ! You‚Äôre out of the tender gang !!!‚Äù
[2:12:40] snerkx: we dont want them "to make more money" we want the "to make more money because they make good shit"
[2:12:47] Thoreya: ppl care more about 200 tendies in the shop than level boosts and $30 for char transfers, wild
[2:12:54] skewlbeta: And it's not like point blank you can buy unlimited tendies on the store. That's a whole different thing
[2:12:57] falldrgn: is it a one time buy? or can you  buy as many as you want?
[2:13:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Public outrage
[2:13:09] Maruika: i cant wait to buy all the tendies
[2:13:12] 91Niki: @xziyn I don't. Nobody is forcing anyone to spend money. Don't blame someone on your own FOMO
[2:13:14] SamuraiWillZ916: Lost ark was my line i
[2:13:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: all this tender talk is making want chicken
[2:13:40] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan LUL
[2:13:49] Eshel: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre yelling !!!‚Äù ‚Ä¶.. ‚Äúloud noises !!!!‚Äù
[2:13:55] Toojicle: @91Niki That's fair, but it shouldn't be a public "outrage." Personal responsibility goes a long way. Why are games an exception when everything else is monetized?
[2:14:00] falldrgn: Its instant gratification.
[2:14:00] Molvonos: @HaxzorJimDuggan Two kinds of tendies.  The chicken kind and teh soft spot on skull kind.
[2:14:09] falldrgn: Same with any gacha game
[2:14:14] Bayne77: forget what? Kappa
[2:14:28] QuigsTV: ded game
[2:14:28] flookguy: Bro BMW charging a monthly sub fee to use heated seats in your car THATS outrage
[2:14:31] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You don't see a problem because you're a whale
[2:14:33] Exodeo_: more like 20000.0  :p
[2:14:35] DunzoCD: dead from making a $5 moonguard mog LUL
[2:14:35] 91Niki: @Toojicle People be acting like Blizzard is holding a gun to their head and making them purchase their store items
[2:14:40] PotbellyGoat: no one will quit over a means of convenience lol
[2:14:44] Sarocus: I thought Blizz died when we got easy epix in AQ40?
[2:14:44] jkitchin75: who cares its not like its pay to win to get a tmog mygod
[2:14:50] tlsmith3638: but but the youtubers i watch told me it bad >.>
[2:14:50] SamuraiWillZ916: i agree with you 100% but what is your line?
[2:14:50] Eshel: Wouldn‚Äôt that be fucking ironic? This is what kills WoW lmfao
[2:14:51] QuigsTV: Blizzard Multi-dollar company LUL

[2:15:00] rymerre: imagine thinking you matter and try to boycott anything
[2:15:08] xziyn: @91Niki When did I say I THNIK that way? I said I understand people having an issue with this and complaining, and y'all are being condescending as fuck telling me to learn how companies work. Yeah multi billions dollars companies want to make more money and will always find ways to increase their profit. Everyone knows it, doesn't mean everyone thinks it's okay. A lot of WoW players are not from the US, don't forget that.
[2:15:14] Affiiance: Ain‚Äôt nobody quitting‚Ä¶ stop it
[2:15:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: meanwhile on aug 24th they come back for HC

[2:15:31] PhantomPrime_: i already quit along time ago cus just not fun to me anymore
[2:15:35] Verdell263: There are so many other things to be mad over with this game/company
[2:15:37] Arbszy: Wait people are still complaining about the store in 2023? LUL
[2:15:41] Thoreya: do ppl cry this much about FFs shop ?
[2:15:46] valianya: Blizzard: makes over a billion this year, "Welp, time to die"
[2:15:47] Zyricks: If the employee walkout didnt end WoW, nothing will
[2:15:59] 91Niki: @xziyn You are taking our messages wayyyyy too personal mate. Take a step back. We are still all referring to the people complaining
[2:16:07] PotbellyGoat: o snap,  do we get DIV patch notes today?
[2:16:10] xziyn: I think the real fear, and the real valid argument is the fear that it's Blizzard testing the waters
[2:16:11] Eshel: @xziyn  That‚Äôs a good point - non US companies aren‚Äôt in it for profit smh
[2:16:18] 91Niki: @Eshel LUL
[2:16:21] Zaitgaizt: Im already looking for the next ting to make me quit LUL
[2:16:21] AnimalCrackers_19: What are we mad about this morning
[2:16:33] jkitchin75: were is all the poe shop hate?
[2:16:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Eshel meanwhile in China
[2:16:54] Eshel: @animalcrackers_19 The color blue is way too fucking blue lol
[2:17:22] firehawk73: why are we complaining about a currency used for tmogs that you arent being forced to buy? i'm confused in my old age...

[2:17:27] Rokaden: Loving my Druid for Season 1, but man I miss my Barbie :(
[2:17:36] flookguy: Gamer Advantage glasses will help you view the transaction store if it‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt deal with.
[2:17:38] xziyn: @Eshel Or you know, those countries are not raised with the idea that socialism is evil, I know it's crazy to consider, and I'm not talking about China or Russia, no.
[2:17:52] Rokaden: WoD was my favorite expansion lol
[2:17:52] Eshel: @firehawk73  Welcome to WoW lol
[2:17:52] Wcvechten: but a  5 dollar bundle will KILL the game!!
[2:18:15] smashwow: during another wod like xpac
[2:18:17] smashwow: wooof
[2:18:21] Nehcrom: @Rokaden I rather liked WoD.
[2:18:23] valianya: Only Blizzard can kill WoW
[2:18:34] PhantomPrime_: the pvp in dragonflight is horrid tho
[2:18:34] 91Niki: @xziyn Lets not take it to politics ty
[2:18:47] Rokaden: WoD and MoP are best expansions for me. SL should be deleted.
[2:18:54] Thoreya: if 9.1/Korthia didnt kill the game, u bet ur ass $5 tendies on the store aint gonna do shit LUL
[2:18:57] flookguy: schawp gifted a Tier 1 sub to Demanisraar! 
[2:18:57] flookguy: schawp is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 6 in the channel! 
[2:19:03] Eshel: @91niki towClap
[2:19:05] DunzoCD: Shadowlands made alot of people lose faith, not the store
[2:19:05] redbulladin: Amen
[2:19:08] ackdogg007: just have the devs from diablo 4 come to wow and it well die pretty quick
[2:19:09] cipusanx: the expansion failed to build hype with the trailer if you ask me. it looked too soft for a wow expansion.
[2:19:14] Ealdfox: Kiss my 200 tendies LUL
[2:19:18] Toojicle: @Eshel My guy it's really pretty simple: you don't want a product? Don't buy it. That isn't just a US thing.
[2:19:19] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:19:21] flookguy: Hopefully that gifted sub goes to a salty sailor so they can buy some stuff off the wow store
[2:19:21] firehawk73: It was the Jailers plan all along...
[2:19:25] MizzKontagious: hi so i just got wow what do you recommend for new players getting into wow?
[2:19:28] xziyn: @91Niki Valid, also not really taking it too personal, just trying to provide a bit of nuance because I do think there are some valid concers over Blizzard's moves and if people should not be surprised at store mounts etc, being surprised at people's negative reaction is at the same level for me lol
[2:19:33] ashwing_: everyone sucking the FF schlong when they release in the store but here the game is dying KEKW
[2:19:38] redbulladin: kiss my tendstickles
[2:19:46] PhantomPrime_: wait people are angry about a 5$ bundle really?
[2:19:48] QuigsTV: @Towelliee just make a YouTube short and say if you dont want it... dont buy it! LUL
[2:19:52] Eshel: @toojicle  That‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm making - we‚Äôre on the same side here :)
[2:19:58] RasmusAdrian22: yea dragonflight is dead
[2:20:03] Toojicle: @91Niki Hmm that's fair. We can all just take a step back
[2:20:04] akia03: but legion was also very bad till last patch
[2:20:05] Rokaden: I dont know why such the hate for Draenor :( Such a great expansion.
[2:20:19] Bayne77: theres stuff to do
[2:20:21] Thoreya: which means a lot of the complaints prob are coming from people that dont play the game
[2:20:23] SeeStrong: I barely play and I've been subbed for 4+ years lol
[2:20:33] Thoreya: or just weirdly complain 24/7 and play
[2:20:40] Arbszy: @MizzKontagious Take it slow, don't rush into things. You will feel overwhelmed. enjoy the ride and once your max level on your first character than begin to slowly get familiar with the systems.
[2:20:56] isBadIRL: i play ff14 that way, im always subbed but only really play during updates.
[2:20:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just dont have the time to commit to WoW and still play all the other new games coming out.
[2:21:26] MizzKontagious: @Arbszy ohhh ok ty <3
[2:21:35] DunzoCD: "whos getting PI" LUL
[2:21:46] Eshel: You know - there‚Äôs a lot of sharp pointy things in WoW - someone could get hurt !! - we should start a ban !! /s lol
[2:21:49] Arocian: wow actually a huge win for a new player. 19 years of content for the price of one game
[2:21:56] Wcvechten: I usually hug the wall here and get through
[2:22:09] Evilbreed83: watching em go from new players sweet and innocent and then BAM raider io
[2:22:32] shortyforthewin: i played the first 10 years when wow started tried out  up too shadow then i stopped
[2:22:40] lordi26: best tank in game? aksept druid
[2:22:50] smashwow: i'll be honest hugging the wall helps
[2:22:55] Eshel: @evilbreed83  Watching their soul slowly die lol
[2:23:02] RasmusAdrian22: xD
[2:23:07] smashwow: you can just hug hug. but the outside gives you some reaction time
[2:23:12] smashwow: can't*
[2:23:12] Evilbreed83: LUL
[2:23:22] Snabido: Rename it to valor- oh
[2:23:26] zysmos: they just need to continue what they're doing now and everything is gonna be fine
[2:23:34] DunzoCD: make a BFA expansion without making people be forced to grind the side content for power
[2:23:40] darkrowse21: i miss old stat reforger
[2:24:09] DarkIntentz: crest feature is a huge plus and the affix changes
[2:24:15] zysmos: just put reforging back into the game make gearing that easier
[2:24:16] Effin_Steffin: Dragonflight 2: Murozond Boogaloo
[2:24:23] Arbszy: They can still improve the crest system more. but past knowledge shows next expansion they will take all the good things of dragonflight and toss it away and gives us bfa again. LUL
[2:24:37] geokouts: make us go to a New planet and do player housing
[2:24:48] Ealdfox: Just put out more 5$ bundles with 200 tendies Kappa
[2:24:52] Jokervenom1978: If they do housing be prepared for a ton of housing decorations on the store lol
[2:24:55] alluza: are they planning on doing housing again? we alredy had that in draenor evry1 was in house arrest
[2:25:18] Evilbreed83: so how awesome is that 15 dollar transmog set huh Kappa
[2:25:42] Exodeo_: what sword? kappa
[2:25:59] Eshel: Know what just dawned on me ? - WoD people were freaking out about ‚Äútime travel‚Äù but those same people aren‚Äôt making a peep about time shenanigans in DF lol
[2:26:10] Arbszy: Experimenting for next expansion usually.
[2:26:17] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Explain how other xpacs did that
[2:26:21] valianya: WoW needs a better new player experience.  They need to create and group old expansion questlines into a main storyline for each so players running old expansions can follow the story clearly through each patch's storyline
[2:26:26] Thoreya: think they confirmed the gear stuff is gonna be the same for 10.2
[2:26:35] Zettabyte: Happy and fun......
[2:26:37] reggiepowa: the faster people are gonna lose interest and quit the game
[2:26:38] indiegarona: Those look like golden Sinestra balls.
[2:26:51] Molvonos: @Indiegarona They're my balls.  I put them inside the group.
[2:27:07] indiegarona: @Molvonos you dirty rebel.
[2:27:08] Exodeo_: @Indiegarona LUL
[2:27:13] Eshel: @molvonos  That‚Äôs hot lol
[2:27:22] ashwing_: someone lliterally does not listen that it has the highest sub retention due to this

[2:28:37] Xedeffen: To be fair, everyone was wanting the game catered to the hardcore players, and we got BFA/SL, they didnt know what they were asking for it seems heh, so glad DF is the direction theyre going now
[2:28:38] 3663Sharad: I guess what he was refering to is to upgrade one pice from lfr to myzthic
[2:28:45] firehawk73: i just want to trade in my 100+ welpling crests to drake crests....

[2:33:32] DrkPhoenix6913: still havent run this place at all yet :P  i cant seem to squeeze together 90 minutes to run it :P
[2:34:01] Affiiance: You think they will convert any current specs to support?
[2:34:18] Affiiance: If so which is the best candidates?
[2:34:29] mrniceguy817: Imo they need a way to target m+ gear I have yet to get a mark of dragul or the vial trink after many runs this season have even seen one of them drop
[2:35:04] tonyr23: Iam a 430 ret and +11s want an aug instead
[2:35:06] Sukodin: they will get it tuned
[2:35:13] Affiiance: I hung up my WW and switched to Aug bc of it
[2:35:43] xziyn: There's no way we don't see more supports with 11.0 or even maybe 10.2
[2:35:44] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:35:51] 3663Sharad: A plain % buff from a Aug is just to valuable, plus all the other stuiff he brings
[2:35:52] abracka_: while they're at it, make survival hunters a tank spec KEKW
[2:35:55] UlthraneDK: It trickles down, because people see that %1 stuff and assume that is the only way to assure they will have a timed key, etc.
[2:35:59] flookguy: Oh 100% they need to do that. Otherwise you‚Äôre taking a spot away in M+ from those that don‚Äôt want to play evoker
[2:36:07] sunbrojavii: Survival hunter as support?
[2:36:09] whiskytrix: its rough when you are in lfg and see allt he meta comps forming for 17 farm groups
[2:36:18] flookguy: Disc priest and enhance shaman are good opportunities and maybe create a third spec for DH?
[2:36:19] AnimalCrackers_19: healers have alawys been support in my book they support healthy team
[2:36:24] Affiiance: Im also doing 20+s and Aug is just easier than WW at those levels
[2:36:29] Rabbi19: The prob they are going to face now is if they make current specs support. Those ppl that main those specs may rage
[2:37:03] Rudric_Ice: it was always there
[2:37:22] flookguy: I think it would be a mistake to add new specs. Already too many. Would make sense to rework current ones even though it‚Äôll piss off some of the user base
[2:37:22] skewlbeta: it's why I remain hypercasual. I just want to play what I think is fun, not the meta.
[2:37:26] PotbellyGoat: spreading like a malignant tunnel
[2:37:30] thomssone: 16 keys want aug and dont invite some specs its ridiculous lol
[2:37:30] Evotype: Typically, how many sub patches are there? Like 10.1.5, 10.2, etc
[2:37:39] whiskytrix: i've 100% rolled alts that are meta so i dont have to wait for hours
[2:37:42] mrniceguy817: I was tanking 17-20‚Äôs last night prot war arms war 2 augs an sham healer absolutely blowing through keys tank 130k+ overall arms 200k+ overall
[2:38:01] Affiiance: All that being said‚Ä¶ the meta specs are fun to play right now
[2:38:05] letrickyxd: it's a bit harder for wow, cause in other games it's just about damage mostly. wow has all these utilities, cc etc. that only exacerbates the situation
[2:38:08] flookguy: @skewlbeta yeah if you are casual don‚Äôt worry about the meta. It doesn‚Äôt honestly make a difference until your 25+.
[2:38:21] ElroenFlyrow: @Evotype We dont have typically sub patches. Its just that blizzard is rocking it amazingly this year and we got 2 sup patches between big patches
[2:38:23] iDeez88: @Affiiance because its busted op
[2:38:24] flookguy: The issue with the meta is clowns out there think they need full meta for a +8
[2:38:31] 3663Sharad: Its either 1/1/1/2 as a new dungeon setup or they add a 6 man for dungeons, which is also weird
[2:39:07] Affiiance: Aug is POG though. I hope they don‚Äôt delete it
[2:39:38] TheItalianStallion321: i just did a 16 as a Dev evoker, they didnt care if i was aug or dev
[2:39:43] TheItalianStallion321: so there are normal people out there
[2:39:47] PotbellyGoat: it's a big mistake for a game to allow meta gaming and not prioritize bring the player
[2:39:50] sipilde: People asking Aug/bear in lvling dungeons
[2:39:59] flookguy: Yeah dude this meta stuff has me spending half my playing time gearing alts ‚Äújust in case meta changes‚Äù it can get tedious or frustrating when you only have a limited time to play

[2:40:25] snerkx: thats fucked
[2:40:26] snerkx: but ye prolly
[2:40:28] Biggins_Prime: personally, leave it as is, and buff Dev so it's a viable alternative
[2:40:29] TheItalianStallion321: i need to farm 400 things for my legendary. anyone want to help? lmao
[2:40:29] Sukodin: I hope they add support specs for other existing classes
[2:40:35] Affiiance: Ugh I hope they don‚Äôt just turn them into another DPS
[2:41:11] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee The new meta is 1 tank 1 fire mage/ shadow priest and 3 Aug.... wait till that JP guy learns about it :D

[2:41:32] robertjordan83: @Towelliee they did it mid xpac in wrath
[2:42:00] Affiiance: Ahhhh 6 man dungeons üßê might not be a bad idea

[2:42:29] justagamingfiend: justagamingfiend subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[2:43:16] Affiiance: It‚Äôs going to take something huge to fix this
[2:43:18] Molvonos: They'd have to utterly gut Aug into the ground to make it a dps spec.
[2:43:23] Molvonos: I doubt they'll get rid of it tho
[2:43:24] whiskytrix: game breaking i think you meant
[2:43:28] Arbszy: It's like Survival, if you change than your admit to giving up and creativity dies.
[2:43:46] 3663Sharad: Holy trinity increased to holy quad-whatever they name might be KEKW

[3:52:41] c0mmander_starscream: @mavericks312 He needed a bump in PR after Arrow he just wanted to get his name out
[3:52:43] Fenixzzz: ppl hating on  marvel -secret invasion
[3:52:50] SeeStrong: He understands but he is completely against Strikes as a way to get what you want
[3:52:54] Wulfgrym: secret invasion was good
[3:52:55] mavericks312: He said the strike was a bad idea an what not
[3:52:57] crems15: Hey Towelie, why do you do it on heroic and mythic?
[3:53:00] 91Niki: Basically said he didn't agree with striking. That striking wasn't the way to go. Easy for him to say when he isn't a writer
[3:53:08] warrenny: @fenixzzz It was good finale was good
[3:53:22] crems15: Ah i see ty
[3:53:25] Masqerader: @91Niki it's not just the writers on strike
[3:53:31] t_train_va: @91Niki It's writers and actors
[3:53:32] 91Niki: Pretty shitty take when you are the one of the people in a movie or tv production that makes the most money
[3:53:39] warrenny: Only ‚Äúissue‚Äù people had was gaea having the same powers as main villain (man)

[3:53:56] 91Niki: Y'all don't get it. Actors are STRIKING to support the writers
[3:53:58] polaropposite76: I liked secret invasion overall, think it needs more than one show to get through tho which seems to be the case
[3:53:59] Wulfgrym: @91Niki they want to replace extras on sets with ai, so that also destroys an entire industry
[3:54:04] herzlustafir: ending was turned up to 11 that was good yes i wish they added one more episode of fighting tho
[3:54:07] Scippa12: Will you be covering patch notes for D4 today? @towelliee
[3:54:20] porkkkkkkkkkk: why not? KEKW
[3:54:23] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym True, but the actors started striking to support the writers
[3:54:28] warrenny: @fenixzzz And i just said the reason why
[3:54:29] Reckless_Maniac: what is this what u'r doing?
[3:54:41] warrenny: It was good
[3:54:48] herzlustafir: little to much he shoots her he shoots him then superskrull.. wanna see more of that superskrull
[3:54:49] Wulfgrym: @91Niki yeah its mainly about the writers but its the whole industry as a whole going down a dangerous route
[3:54:55] herzlustafir: if u catch my drift
[3:54:57] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Oh for sure
[3:55:02] skreng: ive gotten the mount 3 times, no tusks lol wtf
[3:55:03] ShrenTheOrc: paying sag to be a voice actor is bs
[3:55:05] Betrys: @91Niki no they are also striking for themselves.. they did start out striking with the writers
[3:55:10] Fenixzzz: @warrenny yeah i saw that, BUT LOKI season 2  looks gud

[3:56:45] 91Niki: @Aidler Yeah they are gonna have a meeting with the major companies about a deal. We'll see how that goes
[3:56:57] herzlustafir: skrull / kang
[3:57:05] Wheeellz: super skrulls have limits to the way the powers work

[3:57:07] Eshel: Captain Marvel would like a word lol
[3:57:07] ShrenTheOrc: that shit where the super skrull did ebon maws magic arm was bs

[3:57:52] mawrgg: man hope gravik comes back
[3:57:56] Aidler: they will bring something up‚Ä¶. that it was only temporary
[3:57:57] warrenny: @eshel Obe massive similarity
[3:58:00] mawrgg: Super skrulls could be some action
[3:58:05] Wheeellz: super skrulls also arent as durable
[3:58:06] Anneris1: which character are we talking about?
[3:58:07] MinivannGaming: Shes not going to be able to contain the amount of powers she has and ultimately it will destroy her
[3:58:09] Masqerader: she found a home planet for her and the skrulls
[3:58:11] Wheeellz: hence why she dominated gravik
[3:58:17] 91Niki: @Betrys Yes, because it is a union that both houses writers and actors LUL duuuh . That's how it works
[3:58:20] Mallaes: Barbie is a fun dumb movie x3
[3:58:22] herzlustafir: lol

[3:58:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: ken is a scrull

[4:00:56] herzlustafir: the million dollar question is? Tony stark time travels?
[4:01:07] maccaruso: Casually sitting in nuclear radiation for 10 years.....

[4:34:23] flookguy: @animalcrackers_19 that‚Äôs actually not true. However, the way the game has always worked is there‚Äôs been a meta. Meta doesn‚Äôt matter unless you‚Äôre pushing to be a top 1% player. If you wanna be a top 1% player you need to do what they do which is play meta and keep everything geared
[4:34:50] Daarksyde: Towellie always saving people's asses

[4:36:52] Eshel: IKR - full run yesterday and only one piece of loot - wasn‚Äôt even an upgrade sadge
[4:37:26] RoboMaximillion: wth is that mount?
[4:37:37] shaxxtv: it was me
[4:38:01] warrenny: Offensive on keyboard defensive on mouse imo
[4:38:04] restlesstornado_1: what are evil tendies
[4:38:15] arcanitejr: The first time I ever saw you, you were playing arathi basin in Cata running around blowing people up with avengers shield
[4:38:52] draxss: draxss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[4:39:09] pikwi406: I use an orbweaver, make 12 of the keys on it F1-F12 and then bind mouse 1-6
[4:39:24] Molvonos: I don't have any keybinds on my mouse.
[4:39:35] flookguy: I do a lot of shift + a number or Ctrl + a number
[4:39:41] Molvonos: I use 1-5, Alt 1-5, Ctrl 1-5, F1-F4
[4:40:04] MoofasaGaming: I believe SWTOR let you keybinds mouse wheel up or down
[4:40:15] Molvonos: And shift1-5
[4:40:16] xziyn: I find shift modifiers so uncomfortable compared to CTRL and ALT
[4:40:19] Reckless_Maniac: i just use a mouse with 12 buttons on the side
[4:40:53] flookguy: Tell blizz to fix the button bloat for monk haha it‚Äôs nuts

[4:40:54] Molvonos: I feel i'd fatfinger keybinds on a mouse.  It'd be like Elly randomly popping Shroud mid-fight.
[4:41:04] pikwi406: i just feel the 7 8 9 buttons on a mouse are risky to try and hit in the moment with big ass hands

[4:41:43] valianya: I think you can use ICUE with Corsair mouse to keybind mousewheel?  Keybind in WoW to keyboard then ICUE bind keyboard to mousewheel
[4:41:46] AlphasaurusRexx: @MiniGaladriel this fight is boss energy based not health based
[4:41:48] flookguy: Bear is insane and it is not even close
[4:42:12] mavericks312: Ngl rogues could use some buffs
[4:42:26] AlphasaurusRexx: i find it difficult to go from blood dk to prot warrior. i dont feel like i have any control over my health
[4:42:37] mavericks312: Especially assas
[4:42:42] MiniGaladriel: @MiniGaladriel Forgive me, I've stopped actively playing WoW since WotLK.
[4:42:54] StantonSC: bear is only tank i haven't tried, i always heal on droodd
[4:43:17] AlphasaurusRexx: @MiniGaladriel youre good dude. this is the only boss that i know of that is energy based completion
[4:43:45] daniel85mg: the offhealing is insane
[4:43:48] AlphasaurusRexx: dream of cenarius is insane
[4:43:56] AlphasaurusRexx: LoH every 20s

[4:44:53] Masqerader: guardian needs some love after being w/e since legion
[4:45:01] Masqerader: let them have their fun

[4:48:36] Masqerader: but w/e

[4:51:50] ashawn40: Any idea when the D4 patch notes are supposed tp be out?
[4:51:53] Tibayun: I played Baldur's Gate on the cd set
[4:51:54] neverbornlucky: Towelliee I'm 42 I was born
[4:52:05] StantonSC: i was far too high at the time to remember any of it
[4:52:23] 3dRes: How much are you planning to play of BG3?
[4:52:24] Aidler: the 120 gb installation is hard to swallow
[4:52:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: if bear sex did happen it would have happened as soon as a parent walked in the room
[4:52:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: So close!
[4:53:14] Masqerader: need to play lil'jon get low there... to the walls
[4:53:30] Kapatha: 120gig makes sense since game 174 hours of cinematics/ cutscenes
[4:53:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: new jedi game was about 120
[4:54:08] Hebrewish012: ye
[4:54:16] Hebrewish012: narrator lady
[4:54:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: DnD usually has more open-ended stories, you can make choices
[4:54:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: its the same rulebook as dnd 5e
[4:54:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are like thousands of possible paths through the game, depending on what you choose
[4:54:45] Kapatha: and +!20 years after previous BG
[4:54:47] essadis: I recently finished the HBO/Max series Barry.  What a good series.  wonderful creative production.
[4:54:50] Kapatha: *120

[4:54:55] Kapatha: yes
[4:54:56] magenof: Yep lots of decisions
[4:55:00] xHukk: DnD is far more interactive.
[4:55:03] Hebrewish012: you make decisions that affect the game
[4:55:20] neverbornlucky: Towelliee remember run in and loot the chest and stuff in the villages
[4:55:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: think of it like a mass effect style of decision making in dialogue, choices have consequences
[4:55:34] AnimalCrackers_19: The add summons a portal no?
[4:55:41] Aidler: I played DnD 25 years ago. I guess some things changed
[4:55:42] magenof: @HaxzorJimDuggan mass effect barely has decisions lol, dont even compare
[4:55:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: "A lead writer at Larian Studios has let slip that Baldur's Gate 3 has 17,000 possible endings..."
[4:55:55] Kapatha: Larian says there's around 17,000 possible outcomes  (woah)
[4:56:04] reggiepowa: the visuals and combat don't look that great to me
[4:56:16] xHukk: wait, are they launching a DnD video game?
[4:56:21] magenof: The game can be played offline so it will be fine
[4:56:34] essadis: what if we get an old school error like "Please insert CD"
[4:56:46] daywalker1014: @xHukk Baldur's Gate 3
[4:56:46] Desmora: Confidence to tank, but not D&D
[4:56:47] Tooyoo: D&D takes a certain mindset
[4:56:51] Siba234: @xHukk Yes, it's called Balder's Gate 3
[4:56:54] StantonSC: they launching a month early so i think they think it'll be smooth
[4:57:01] Tooyoo: I cant do imagination play in front of other ppl
[4:57:03] Eshel: Would sell my kidney for a Shadowrun MMO
[4:57:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: you could do a coop campaign with lula leading you through it
[4:57:04] xHukk: @daywalker1014 gotcha
[4:57:05] Masqerader: i use to play dnd a lot as a kid, along with mtg
[4:57:10] neverbornlucky: Towelliee you could be a Paladin in D&D
[4:57:29] Tibayun: I am an old D&D geek but DDO is not as fun as I expected. I enjoyed the original Baldur's Gate though.
[4:57:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked how in BG3 you can kick a mob over the edge of a dropoff and they die
[4:57:35] falldrgn: DD is fun.. just need to use your imaginatiuon
[4:57:42] essadis: what i like is that BG3, from what i heard, is that you can just play what you have fun with.  sure there are some min/max but it's like more of an adventure.  I need me some adventure
[4:57:54] Crypticedge: I have heard if you dont have a good DM then its never as good as it can be..
[4:57:57] Aidler: yeah, first DnD and the MtG came along
[4:58:07] StantonSC: Morchie needs bigger hats... >.>
[4:58:23] PotbellyGoat: my 2nd tub of Boomer Blast arrived
[4:58:47] Hebrewish012: I guess Cohh the streamer is voicing one of the characters in BG3 which is kinda cool

[5:00:23] StantonSC: voicing the guy everyone's going to kill off the first chance they get lol
[5:00:28] unlimited_32: Hi
[5:00:32] Hebrewish012: @magenof nah one of the silly side characters I'm sure it's not anything to do with a main char
[5:00:47] unlimited_32: What do you think about using the Allah Al Akbar mindset?
[5:01:05] Eshel: @neverbornlucky  We had a dude like that when I played DC-RPG - until GM melted her with acid by the Joker in the middle of the act lmao
[5:01:08] BarthelemeusNL: y
[5:01:23] essadis: i would say that's accurate
[5:01:47] shortyforthewin: i never liked th turnbased games

[5:02:09] BarthelemeusNL: there is no preload

[5:02:56] neverbornlucky: Towelliee get a gamer bottle to pee in or a hose attached to the bottle so you don't have to get up
[5:02:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: The turn based stuff was alright back in the day, but these days I would rather just have good party AI
[5:03:03] reggiepowa: because it's in early access
[5:03:06] Gungre: They can't preload because it will fuck up early access
[5:03:09] winnieethepuuh: because of steam
[5:03:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: because the early access is still techically available
[5:03:13] Jodicus: Early Access to Full Game issues apparently on Steam
[5:03:15] BarthelemeusNL: both
[5:03:16] Gungre: Co-op
[5:03:18] goobermelon: coop
[5:03:20] essadis: either

[5:03:41] essadis: i think you can vote
[5:03:45] warchildlive: Is prot warrior viable this league?
[5:03:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: whoever started the conversation
[5:03:56] goobermelon: Everyone can vote
[5:04:06] reggiepowa: wasn't swtor based on rolling. person with highest roll won?
[5:04:08] essadis: i'm kind of going in blind.  avoided the game for 3 years
[5:04:10] ididntdoitfr: What game is being talked about?
[5:04:14] goobermelon: But ulitmately the player who began the conversation gets to decide
[5:04:19] BarthelemeusNL: i thought there was even a system that streamers can let there chat vote
[5:04:21] BarthelemeusNL: but not sure
[5:04:24] essadis: i only played the character creation screen so i can look at the skills
[5:04:25] Tibayun: If I read this correctly, only Act 1 is being released tomorrow for early access. Level cap will be 5.
[5:04:33] essadis: @ididntdoitfr BG3
[5:04:35] fizzalf: @ididntdoitfr baulders gate 3
[5:04:35] valianya: Currently the game on Steam is EA version, to avoid removing Early Access from players they cannot swap to full version on Steam to allow early download
[5:04:40] StantonSC: @ididntdoitfr balders gate 3
[5:04:40] Davedaman26: That Bloodhunter set from the trading post looks awesome
[5:04:48] Eshel: RWF - sponsored by AT&T lmao
[5:04:52] ididntdoitfr: ah ty
[5:05:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah the twitch extension will let chat vote on dialogue choices, not sure if it forces the streamer to pick it though
[5:05:46] BarthelemeusNL: if im correct there is even a sustem that you can let your stream chat vote but you in the end decide
[5:06:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Letting chat make choices in a game is going to get crazy, but it sounds fun
[5:06:15] Eshel: Joke about people with fast internet getting first access - not one of my best admittedly
[5:06:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: have to link your steam and twitch on the larion account website
[5:06:52] hugosilva: hugosilva subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 62 months! hello!

[5:08:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: on steam yes
[5:08:50] essadis: i bought it a couple days ago. does that count?

[5:10:26] goobermelon: They confirmed that you can't  have a relationship with another created character
[5:10:26] BarthelemeusNL: there is supposed to be a quest where you can fuck a druid in bear form
[5:10:29] Phoxzy: So if you buy early access you get the digital deluxe content for free?
[5:10:32] valianya: The bear is a druid

[6:23:56] Sadisticmedic: Asmongold will say something
[6:24:02] kingdaddy96: The biggest benefit of mob density is whirlwind and chain damage builds
[6:24:16] Arocian: well, k, but they could have just messed with xp
[6:24:17] neverbornlucky: Towelliee you are my denisty
[6:24:29] TheGiant99: DatModz complains about density all day
[6:25:00] Zucchey: @Zucchey I don't want anything, it was just a response for that dude, bosses will not exist for me either way with bone necro
[6:25:20] Arocian: I don't think it was a density issue, it was a time to level to 100 issue. Adjust xp, xp gain, or xp needed probably would have addressed the issue
[6:25:25] ark_exitWound: you get them today @Towelliee ?? I remember getting lucky and getting them within 2 weeks of spam farming way back when <3
[6:25:47] Arocian: lol
[6:25:49] fizzalf: i am soon done with the season  chapters now
[6:25:53] fizzalf: soon boys
[6:26:01] unowncreature: Boss HP is what happens when people make fun of how easy they are.
[6:26:04] Daarksyde: but they are guaranteed leg drops from bosses and events start at 35... so people getting better gear might make those HP increases doable
[6:26:09] TheGiant99: Watch Asmon videos he does also. There is to much visible negativity
[6:26:48] Gingerprimer: !tusks
[6:26:50] Arocian: yep
[6:27:27] TheGiant99: Stockade will take an hour lol
[6:27:29] ark_exitWound: how many runs of SIEGE of Ogr you end up doing @Towelliee ?????
[6:27:41] unowncreature: As barb probably because I don't think what they are doing for them in the patch is enough.
[6:27:45] cannibaal_: Where is Lore at now?
[6:28:17] Molvonos: How's that Spriest working out for you?

[7:14:31] Beeftin: boss fights in old were 'move out of the giant swirl'
[7:14:33] Murlocz: Just dont have addons Kappa
[7:14:36] Crypticedge: so dramatic....lif you dont like it dont play it, and shut up
[7:14:36] Molvonos: There was no fucking struggle, we were using addons in Vanilla.
[7:14:39] Molvonos: The fuck you say
[7:14:43] abracka_: you can't compare vanilla wow difficulty to current gen difficulty. vanilla difficulty was only because of ignorance of mechanics
[7:14:46] ashwing_: My guy struggled with 2 boss mechanics per raid or the guy spamming arcane explosion only in MC KEKW
[7:14:48] gamerJDM: only struggle was the hardware back then
[7:14:52] Dyriks: ohh the struggle of 12fps
[7:14:53] amazulu_: the struggle of old is running wow on at 800x600 on a pentium 3. the game was easy.
[7:14:59] ytsidilas: the struggle of no information
[7:15:07] Carnasses: The great thing about add-ons, you dont have to use them if you don't want to
[7:15:08] Dyriks: LUL
[7:15:16] loli_alexa: like u die in raid then u walk entire map to getback there
[7:15:16] Delkamus04: old...dodge two mechanics and hope to god your internet stays connected....aol ultimate end game
[7:15:17] loli_alexa: hhhhhh
[7:15:24] Molvonos: Chromaggus was the reason why a bunch of addons got nixed tho
[7:15:27] amazulu_: back in vanilla i had to stare at the wall in vaelstraz's room because i would get single digit frame rates otherwise
[7:15:34] Crypticedge: this guy is just bitching to bitch, hes probably a neck beard that still makes classic montages
[7:15:35] Noshpan: Naw. The struggle was playing WoW with a 56k dial up modem
[7:15:54] jkitchin75: if classic is hard why are raid bosses getting 1 shot
[7:15:56] ashwing_: LUL
