[0:14:32] trippsski: are you done streaming?
[0:14:52] toobaked1987: Towelliee should buying gold on HC Classic be a bannable offense?
[0:15:15] trippsski: oh awesome thats what i thought but i miss read the timer cause you were on earlier today as well right
[0:15:52] LarryDean: LarryDean subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months!

[0:17:47] toobaked1987: Sodapoppin buys gold and gets a slap on the hand. Unbelievable
[0:17:50] BubbaChubbs420: pallys are so good in m+
[0:18:47] grumpzzzz: i saw the star wars pics, thats some nice shit
[0:19:31] toobaked1987: He openly admitted to buying it
[0:19:57] toobaked1987: He bought thousands of gold from a gold seller. Blizzard just took his gold awa
[0:19:57] Veegore: he also openly admits to botting, and botted on stream back in the day, who really cares?
[0:19:57] Harusame12: they just took the gold off him but did not ban him
[0:20:04] FatimusPrime: Yeah those Star Wars rips were awesome
[0:21:07] toobaked1987: I think its totally fucked. I cannot believe how Blizzard gave him a greenlight.
[0:21:12] fatboilevi: does towelliee play SoD? if so what server?
[0:21:28] Veegore: @toobaked1987 that's honestly what they do for a lot of people buying gold, at least first confirmed offenders
[0:21:41] jubee240: @Towelliee  its crazy cause now i see on youtube wow gold ads. i like yo wtf???
[0:23:24] BubbaChubbs420: got bolstered :(
[0:23:33] NobodybetterPat: waddup towel
[0:24:20] reesedubz: xd
[0:27:11] BubbaChubbs420: what is a good punishment then?
[0:27:23] BubbaChubbs420: ban for 7 days?
[0:27:26] BubbaChubbs420: or life
[0:27:59] Molvonos: The same punishment anyone else would recieve for such

[0:28:21] BubbaChubbs420: which is what?
[0:28:27] toobaked1987: Should be a temporary ban minimal. Most get a perm ban
[0:28:34] Veegore: @BubbaChubbs420 It's usually a tiered punishment, they take the gold away for first time offenders and warning, then it's 7 day, 30 day, life.
[0:28:41] BubbaChubbs420: do people lose their accounts?
[0:29:16] Veegore: there might be a 90 day in there before life time
[0:29:42] toobaked1987: Blizzard just doesn't care anymore. SoD economy totally sucks. HC gold sellers are everywhere. Sad
[0:30:18] Molvonos: @toobaked1987 That's a strawman.  They do care, they are banning bots, there's only so much they can do in a short period of time however.
[0:30:44] Molvonos: The bot-runners are already starting to learn by not using chinese in their character/pet names, for example.

[0:31:12] UnearthedSin: I get daily ingame mails telling me that my reports have lead to bot bans, so they are trying.
[0:31:15] toobaked1987: @Molvonos Well, their message was if youre a millionaire streamer you aight. I bet us poor boys without a following would get perma ban no questions asked.
[0:31:24] Molvonos: @toobaked1987 Two entirely different issues.
[0:32:51] toobaked1987: Its obvious. Their raid is about to happen. Its going to have a HUGE viewer count. They dont wanna mess that up by banning Soda.
[0:33:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard definitely bans a lot of accounts for breaking the rules, I appreciate it overall

[2:30:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it seems like which is better depends on the situation and what is needed for the fight
[2:30:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can tell you this, that tier set proc for blood DK fires off a lot, very nice
[2:31:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: I wish my bear had that
[2:33:24] superpudd: @Yurkeezy depends on content, both are solid but prot pally is better in M+ atm. Still waiting to see as BDKs get their leggos
[2:35:16] Yurkeezy: Okay, i was looking to come back to tanking. i played prot pally way back when but swapped to DPS class. so i wad debating on using that EXP pack lvl 70 upgrade to make a tank

[2:35:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure that legendary axe is going to increase blood DK performance, even though they might not need that charge component on it much
[2:35:55] Molvonos: The channel on the axe is really bad for tanks though

[2:36:29] Molvonos: So if you pop it right before you need a defensive, you're gonna be in for a bad time.
[2:36:35] Masqerader: not sure if its been mention, if anyone watched or fan of brooklyn nine, nine Andre Braugher the captain died =(
[2:36:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, generally the channels will bork defense like with parry and dodge
[2:37:29] Masqerader: yes
[2:37:39] Noshpan: Yeah
[2:38:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Shadowlands they had to change the channel on Fleschcraft so it didn't ruin defenses
[2:38:42] Molvonos: BDK's had a channeled ability too that messed with everything and they got rid of it too.
[2:39:15] Eschotaeus: blood drain or something? yea i kinda wish they could make that work
[2:39:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah blood DK has a blood drinker channel, but it specifically doesn't wreck their defense
[2:40:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: A BoE would be nice
