[3:18:47] Thadune: reduced after 5
[3:18:57] nihilistic_bat: Linearly reduced damage from 5 to 12, no change from 12 to 13, uncapped from 13 to 20, soft-capped after 20. says wowhead
[3:20:40] Yaz3k: Havoc DPS getting better?
[3:20:46] TheNoMansLands: it never been bad
[3:20:48] Buckwink: Havoc keeps getting buffs
[3:20:49] Yaz3k: been onf the game for a while
[3:20:57] filos0phia: havoc ST is kinda bad tho
[3:21:16] filos0phia: their 99% parses are still ~2k less than affliction warlocks
[3:21:19] toobaked1987: @Towelliee so youre saying BM hunter has a chance :D

[3:21:48] fluh_: bm deserves an xpac off :)
[3:22:07] BustinGutz: new venthyr warrior here should i be making the unhinge legendary or exploiter for pvp?
[3:22:10] toobaked1987: I know. I will remain this spec until the end of days
[3:22:20] filos0phia: that's true, I can't wait to see the new fights
[3:22:33] toobaked1987: Nothing like 220 ilvl and feeling worthless
[3:22:51] DraculaPKT: what covenant are you?
[3:22:55] TheNoMansLands: i mean parses ... there are other things than parses to judge a dps tbh. Still brings more to a raid than rogue. Amazing aoe. And sweet 5% dmg touch.
[3:23:10] Pups_Gersky: @Towelliee How does Prot Warrior feel?
[3:23:14] itsZiz: When are we guessing patch 9.1 comes out? i need to lvl a new toon
[3:23:32] Jesperoni: june? that's what i've heard @itsZiz
[3:23:39] Plague_GG: Juneish

[3:27:12] Rossii77: challengung shout
[3:27:14] Pups_Gersky: I'm debating remaking my Prot Warrior build I had back in WoD. It slapped pretty good. Even in pvp it was viable, probably not now a days.
[3:27:15] cyllos: what changes are going to make prot warrior really good? the new necrolord ability? the change to reprisal leggo? the 10% aura increase + tclap increase? all of the above?
[3:27:27] Zivs: the combo yeah @cyllos
[3:27:40] Contendedlemon: at level 58

[3:30:52] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[3:30:55] Pups_Gersky: Shadowlands is the result of all that.

[3:31:42] Aedarax: KEKW
[3:31:52] Kromede: i tell what i want, what i really really want Kappa
[3:31:53] Kheonik: I mean if they're confused about all that they're just stupid
[3:31:54] ZeethianDragon: I mean that's blizzards on fault pve is th way it is.
[3:31:54] andrewmb01: who wants the grind?
[3:31:54] Contendedlemon: we want loot we just dont want loot wasting 100 slots in our bags lol
[3:31:56] average_j4y: can't please everyone unfort
[3:31:57] Demanisraar: it's all just wrong LUL
[3:32:04] Holysal: world 1st raiders are happy though
[3:32:14] andrewmb01: someone wants the grind?
[3:32:24] wetttnine: corruption was bad
[3:32:24] ZeethianDragon: w1st raiders are always happy. they are that 0.1%
[3:32:25] Broomba: blizzard should ignore buying stock and advice from Bellular
[3:32:28] Thadune: whoever said conduit energy is a good thing should be written up! I dont want anyone to lose their jobs.
[3:32:36] Plague_GG: Having a grind is part of an mmo
[3:32:37] filos0phia: if they want the grind they should grind anima :P
[3:32:38] Aidler: because they don‘t know who to listen to. they listen too much to streamers etc. and not to the normal casual player
[3:33:00] toobaked1987: @Towelliee has Ion become one of the wrong people? Maybe its time for a new game director

[3:33:10] rocthenite: no clue what i want to do for classic tbc
[3:33:11] filos0phia: @Aidler that's a side effect of everyone else listening to streamers and content creators too
[3:33:25] filos0phia: tons of people hear something from their favourite streamer and decide they feel the same
[3:33:28] deadman385: Eddy_zombie310 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[3:34:06] Plague_GG: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:34:08] Thadune: They listen to the wrong streamers/content creator
[3:34:14] Aidler: @filos0phia probably. but a company like blizz should or could have the ressources and the knowledge to be above that
[3:34:47] rocthenite: like bellalar don't play the game and make videos on wow acting like he knows a ton
[3:35:06] toobaked1987: SL has most streamers NOT streaming SL
[3:35:25] Plague_GG: in classic I keep pressing my movement speed key one thinking I’m on retail and nothing’s there slootPH
[3:35:35] Thadune: Thats what I mean
[3:35:35] Plague_GG: keybind*
[3:35:41] Thadune: They listen to the WRONG ones
[3:36:09] ZakuzaGB: but a streamer/influencer can affex what a large amount of people think about the game
[3:36:11] LRY_pinkiepie: lry_pinkiepie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 94 months! 
[3:36:19] ZakuzaGB: cough bald cough
[3:36:20] Masqerader: need to be more vocal about removing fortified and tyrannical
[3:36:38] Aidler: @zakuzagb that‘s it
[3:36:50] jerexify: Wait, they changed the M+ keystone thing again?
[3:37:07] NILLme: im still surprised that they buffed prot warr's damage but blood dk's are still doing no dmg
[3:37:08] filos0phia: @Towelliee I didn't feel that way when covenants were being discussed. Every streamer (besides maybe you) was so up in arms about the covenants and I couldn't understand the general hate
[3:37:23] CardinalTX: Funny thing is they do the same thing in ESO.......people that actually play the game give feedback and they say............oh thats nice but fuck you were are going to do what we want
[3:37:33] filos0phia: I'd be interested to see how people feel about covenants now
[3:37:41] Kheonik: I feel like they just go too much into one direction instead of trying to find a middle ground that works. Like with loot they removed titanforging variance which a lot of people hated but then they also gutted the amount of loot and the cap of m+ loot ilvl
[3:37:41] ChaosKunai: haste vers
[3:37:47] Boxbound: filos0phia whath appened to covenants?
[3:37:52] extinktion: What addon you use for the xp bar?
[3:37:53] Fl3tchTTV: haste verse crit mast

[3:38:13] JoshStryker: hi
[3:38:21] filos0phia: @Boxbound nothing, but when the xpac was announced people were furious about covenants. Every youtube channel had multiple videos going on about how awful they were
[3:38:27] Fl3tchTTV: they are all really close, but go by HVCM
[3:38:41] ZeethianDragon: it almost feels like they take it too far on purpose
[3:38:45] Aquatic_Sloth: I agree
[3:38:48] filos0phia: in reality, covenants are pretty chill and not some huge gateway to dungeons/raids
[3:38:49] Masqerader: which is funny cause the middle = balance
[3:39:00] JoshStryker: yeah hi
[3:39:08] boeghl33t: !cam
[3:39:09] ZeethianDragon: they take shit too damn far
[3:39:09] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[3:39:12] Cafe0le: NotLikeThis
[3:39:18] armybone1: who want balance anyway Kappa
[3:39:25] ZakuzaGB: we just wanted bfa without TF haha
[3:39:28] Wcvechten: I mean, did anyone mind WF when it was only like 6 ilvls in MOP?
[3:39:35] Kheonik: @Towelliee Yeah like this should've honestly been tested more during beta and listened to feedback about how people feel about the amount of loot etc. They could've fixed this before it ever became a problem on live. Same with the sad amount of anima you used to get from everything.
[3:39:42] KingSlayerYotam: 8.3 with visions was so much fun to gear chars as a casual
[3:39:42] ZeethianDragon: they did worse than BFA
[3:39:43] NILLme: because they are afraid that people will gear up too fast and unsub
[3:39:45] Cafe0le: bet they blame it on the removal of titanfoge and they bring it back
[3:39:59] Contendedlemon: its just the classic blizzard maneuver, break one thing dont listen to player base then fix it another patch later on in the xpa
[3:40:20] ZakuzaGB: they replaced the AP grind with gear grind

[3:40:22] ZeethianDragon: making the game harder and much more grindier is not good, just makes people want to stop playing
[3:40:34] Unlord: why blizzard never listen to their players?? that wierd
[3:40:39] Kromede: 200IQ
[3:40:44] ZakuzaGB: true LUL
[3:40:45] Masqerader: Blizzard logic = If it ain't broke, break it
[3:40:50] raymond3195: this wod All over again and can't see a 9.3
[3:40:54] Kheonik: @Towelliee Yeah exactly it should've been implemented way earlier.
[3:40:57] Xailen: There is far too many random bits of gear to work with the current loot system, it needs basically a simple static loot system. "Need a specific weapon, go run this boss till you get it."
[3:41:00] Lockrocker: i have yet to get anything off a World Boss.. lol
[3:41:01] ZeethianDragon: PvPers have it easy.  PVE is so shit LUL
[3:41:15] NILLme: give back the titanforging and let us also slowly upgrade our gear to the max ilvl...
[3:41:17] Austei: sucks as a causal player for sure
[3:41:34] Thadune: Should we talk about how Torghast was probably the biggest let down? So much promised... nothing delivered so far.
[3:41:36] Unlord: i dont think it make poeple more happier but more frustrated ya
[3:41:38] filos0phia: loot token is a better idea than more raid drops imo
[3:41:39] itsZiz: Casual.. waiting hours for dps M+ and th4en no loot, no thanks
[3:41:42] wisperuna: @Towelliee no loot token man for  normal dorps on m+ it is fine
[3:41:53] UltiCarnagee: So you think Bonus Rolls will return for raids atleast?
[3:42:00] Masqerader: so nice being able to mount doing maw intro quest with the Torghast mount
[3:42:01] ZeethianDragon: @filos0phia let alone not that many people actually have the time to raid as well
[3:42:15] Aidler: + the flight master wistle... that was loved by everyone
[3:42:16] fatalityphase: @Unlord It's not always a matter of listening to the players. You need competent game designers on the team to ultimately know how to make a fun game/expansion.
[3:42:18] Plague_GG: imagine Blizzard admitting they’re wrong slootKEK
[3:42:23] rocthenite: like i like getting rid of tf but why lower loot and no tokens, what is the point outside of the player palytime
[3:42:25] Orthobullet: maybe everything but TF
[3:42:30] Coffins85: Honestly they should just scrap the loot tables all together from the Mythic + Dungeons and use the Valor System to allow you to buy the piece of gear from the Loot tables that you want.
[3:42:35] Thadune: Bonus rolls won't matter when the rolls have the same chance as the loot drops KEKW
[3:42:36] wisperuna: @Towelliee Never liked the whole token shit just a way  to dump gold
[3:42:37] filos0phia: @Aidler they wont bring the flight whistle back when they already announced flying imo
[3:42:38] Coffins85: That makes it equal to the PVP System.
[3:42:42] xideontv: i would only give 1 loot coin, but with 100% loot drop
[3:42:42] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:42:44] Xailen: I have yet to get a drop from world bosses. LUL
[3:42:58] ZeethianDragon: make gearing in PVE just as easy as it is in  PvP
[3:43:04] xideontv: 2k anima for the coin
[3:43:07] KeidooTV: best way to lvl do dungeons
[3:43:20] Jesperoni: warrior tanking just looks so badass
[3:43:25] Unlord: fatality ya but after all these years ! well they cant ever make everyone's happy but maybe more then they are now ? i want to return to wow and all poeple told me it dont ..i mean that not very encouraged to comeback :(
[3:44:18] Jesperoni: the anima gear is actually really good to farm
[3:44:30] Aidler: @filos0phia such a easy and small quality of life item that everybody liked and nobody hated. no idea how they could take that out in the first place
[3:44:54] coffeeatm: 197 yea
[3:44:57] Jesperoni: ye for an alt that's alright
[3:44:59] Zivs: the gear is pretty good for alts i've found atleast
[3:45:02] CardinalTX: Doing harder content should get you gear faster. Let people run heroics for tokens that can lead to upgrades.........Hell make it take 10 times longer to get than harder content
[3:45:04] Mr_Pennywise_: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:45:09] Vivelli: been tempted to lvl my warr to play fury again.
[3:45:19] ZeethianDragon: getting pass 200 sucks
[3:45:23] CritcobainTV: the anima is super cheap though my druid has like 5 pieces maxed out, its pretty quick
[3:45:24] coffeeatm: Yeah but not all like to spend time pvping :D
[3:45:24] stratiss: no 197 honor takes a ton of honor
[3:45:24] RocketMan23: cuz people dont like pvp
[3:45:24] Pups_Gersky: non ranked and anima gear cap out at 197.
[3:45:33] wetttnine: ya i cant get pass 200
[3:45:40] Pups_Gersky: Now you can easily get 200 ilvl gear do that conquest grind.
[3:45:42] Jesperoni: true, but if i'm shit at pvp, it's a good way to start :D
[3:45:51] wetttnine: weapons are unicorns smh
[3:46:00] ZeethianDragon: 5000 valor. 1500 per week cap like 3-4weeks to get 5000 LUL  long grind
[3:46:04] HerbalxDruid: yea farm the honor, thats why pvp and bg's and skirms and areana is filled with afk and braindead morons just tryin to farm honor to do fuck all once they get it
[3:46:07] micha3lsc0tt: do we know if ksm is account wide for valor points?
[3:46:12] rocthenite: @Towelliee what is a good server for classic alliance side
[3:46:32] Aidler: can‘t get the keystone achivements so no loot above 200 for me... no matter how much valor I get
[3:46:34] Vivelli: yeah thats the other part, idk if ill be coming back for 9.0.5 just not much there
[3:46:41] Keyastaron_: isnt LFR in the next raid tier be the MYTHIC ilvl of the previous raid tier
[3:46:53] Aquatic_Sloth: i mean the whole point of the system is alt catch up
[3:47:00] Aquatic_Sloth: so if it wasnt that would be wack
[3:47:04] ZeethianDragon: so many people would quit if that happened LUL
[3:47:04] KingSlayerYotam: i was surprised they are banning guilds in china
[3:47:05] ZakuzaGB: why though
[3:47:10] SheTiltsMe: @Towelliee do you get feet pics sent to you from hunnie fans
[3:47:19] ZakuzaGB: isnt it equiv to getting 1800 and been able to upgrade it?
[3:47:25] ZakuzaGB: but like way easier

[3:50:41] Gankcore: How much valor do each of the pieces cost? Is that confirmed anywhere yet?
[3:50:44] Vivelli: wouldnt be surprised if its gonna take till 9.1 to get all that gear upgraded to 220
[3:50:52] micha3lsc0tt: @Gankcore yea its on wowheaad
[3:51:01] Gankcore: @micha3lsc0tt dope, thanks!
[3:51:06] micha3lsc0tt: weapons are the most to upgrade of course
[3:51:56] Vivelli: NotLikeThis
[3:52:02] CritcobainTV: NotLikeThis
[3:52:08] NILLme: im extremely disappointed that they capped it at 220... most people that farm 15s are already 220+
[3:52:08] ZeethianDragon: we don't talk about the maw here
[3:52:16] ZakuzaGB: im fine with that so much vie not done in the open world like rares etc farming casual shit
[3:52:29] filos0phia: @Towelliee do you think that the gem slots from venari will stay relevant into 9.1?
[3:52:32] Moonori: atleast we get to catch up on classic and prep for tbc
[3:52:36] nclemen24: the valor system isn't meant for the folks that can farm 15s
[3:52:41] Pups_Gersky: I still need to find a group to get that damn spider mount. I'm 1316 atm with 22% towards it but its been loss after loss.
[3:53:33] filos0phia: oh they said that, sadge
[3:53:36] Pups_Gersky: yea they changed ravager as well.
[3:53:55] Ldysansa: Oh wow lol
[3:54:24] rocthenite: for my allaince mage in tbc gnome or human
[3:54:32] filos0phia: just doing my weekly visions I was able to get tons of gems on 8.3 but doing my weekly maw quests I'm not even close to the rep for gems
[3:54:48] filos0phia: hopefully they're a little nicer with gems in 9.1
[3:54:50] coffeeatm: So in 9.05 its gone 4 weeks to upgrade 2 handed weapon from 210 to 220
[3:55:04] Rossii77: what covenant are you going for the prot warrior?
[3:55:07] Aidler: I‘l be at 200 till 9.1 towLul
[3:55:28] shmasherd: 9.05 does shit all for most of us

[3:55:35] ZeethianDragon: takes 4 weeks just to upgrade 10ilvls.
[3:56:03] akia03: good for boosters atleast
[3:56:08] ZeethianDragon: it takes too long
[3:56:10] Aquatic_Sloth: I honestly think the system is dead on arrival lol
[3:56:17] CanadianHellMoose: why would it take 4 weeks ?
[3:56:19] Buckwink: yeah the valor system looks pretty fucking stupid
[3:56:26] filos0phia: yeah this valor stuff has been amazing for boosters lol
[3:56:27] Bruizedfish: thats why im in your tbc classic guild haha
[3:56:30] Alegnowar: idk why they rolled whit this 0.5 patch instead of going for 9.1 directly
[3:56:36] D3m0nHunt3r666: Im just gonna upgrade like 2-3 pieces and im already 220 lol , its just plain dumb
[3:56:39] Vivelli: with how little time they spent on 9.0.5, that 9.1 update better be hot
[3:56:42] ZeethianDragon: @CanadianHellMoose valor cap is 1500 a week but 5000 you would need to upgrade a piece so 4 weeks of gear.
[3:56:49] Buckwink: I think Blizzard is confused and in semi panic mode
[3:56:52] ZeethianDragon: it's really fucking stupid
[3:56:52] Masqerader: Resident Evil 8 in May
[3:56:52] c4mmweir: Oh damn prot warrior!
[3:56:54] CanadianHellMoose: valor cap is 5000
[3:56:55] armybone1: plus ppl can do the Twisting Corridors easy
[3:57:01] CanadianHellMoose: you can only hold 1500 at a time
[3:57:05] ZeethianDragon: yes
[3:57:07] ZeethianDragon: 1500 a week
[3:57:10] CanadianHellMoose: no
[3:57:13] CanadianHellMoose: that is wrong
[3:57:17] rocthenite: @Towelliee is it ok i join your tbc classic guild?
[3:57:19] archninja64: If the gear grind was easier but not stupid easy I would play more alts
[3:57:20] CanadianHellMoose: the initial cap is 5k
[3:57:41] Fl3tchTTV: nah it procs still
[3:57:42] cyllos: it still has a proc
[3:57:44] Aquatic_Sloth: still does proc
[3:57:46] Thadune: both cause no rage cost
[3:57:47] MirroredZephyr: Hard Cap is 1500 to hold, you have to spend if you want the 5k
[3:57:48] szeeman62: @towelliee are you gonna be playing The Show on ps5?
[3:57:49] Aquatic_Sloth: just feels like less
[3:58:00] Demanisraar: No you can collect 5k a week
[3:58:05] Demanisraar: but you can only hold 1500
[3:58:10] c4mmweir: How does it work, how much do you get for completing a dungeon ?
[3:58:10] Aidler: when 9.1 hits I guess I will have 5000 valor and still 200 ilvl gear towLul
[3:58:23] coffeeatm: Lol - 1000 Valor - Two-Handed Weapon per rank :P yeah brother think am gone pass on that :P
[3:58:25] ZeethianDragon: that's just not a good system

[4:10:48] ZeethianDragon: he needs to get over it
[4:10:50] wetttnine: he even said classic was too much as well..
[4:11:07] ZeethianDragon: shit will change, that's just how it is.
[4:11:09] Reklusion: Staysafe should just learn when to shut up already

[4:12:37] ZeethianDragon: hardcore gaming is just not the way it should be anymore

[4:13:50] Hononoe: wow u r already 55 :D
[4:13:52] Vivelli: only thing i remember from TBC is being ganked in hellfire by a mace rogue, and killing magatheredon on my prot pally.
[4:13:56] ZeethianDragon: yo man, heard you were wrong
[4:13:57] Vivelli: good times
[4:13:58] coffeeatm: BWL
[4:14:05] justagamingfiend: chromus
[4:14:10] WarriorMuffins: i would play TBC if there is a 58 boost but no way i am leveling to 60 lol
[4:14:21] cruzeal: thanks
[4:14:25] Fl3tchTTV: Yup Chromaggus
[4:14:28] ZeethianDragon: Draconian deflector?
[4:14:42] Clicklesly: Pre-patch levelling to 60 will probably be nerfed already anyway ^^
[4:14:47] akia03: @WarriorMuffins 1 boost per acount no blood elf or drainei
[4:14:57] Fl3tchTTV: Cant be used on blood elves or draenei, which i think is fair
[4:15:10] WSeveryn: @Towelliee can you boost a BE Paladin?
[4:15:16] cruzeal: no
[4:15:27] Kryssner: why only one per account boost? i hate leveling and i dont have time for it, but i enjoy end game on multiple classses.
[4:15:28] andoba: @towelliee ive never boost a toon before. what do u get with it? does it comes with gear and weapon???
[4:15:34] notdustinx: Can you save the boost to use at launch for blood elf?
[4:15:39] coffeeatm: @Towelliee The Market is gone bee busted if they dont change the snapshot of you classic char, imaging having a rich friend trading you 1 mil gold, shit snapshots you toon, then all you need to do is trade the gold back to you friend
[4:15:39] Stormrazer78: So You Can boost a pala on horde?
[4:15:43] akia03: @Kryssner bots mostly
[4:15:56] Clicklesly: Only belf palas, so no ^^
[4:16:10] Moonori: you got the 30% exp nerf so it won't be as bad
[4:16:10] justagamingfiend: how choppy will that starting zone be. lol
[4:16:16] coffeeatm: From what ive heard it copys you char
[4:16:28] alaskagodx: were spriests good in bc or am i fucked by playing it lol
[4:16:30] Kryssner: @diathi123  i dont care for boots, if i can play the game the way i enjoy it
[4:16:33] Clicklesly: Snapshot happens at the time of prepatch for everyone ^^
[4:16:41] Vivelli: only thing similar/same is the name of the server
[4:16:43] coffeeatm: Yeha
[4:16:52] coffeeatm: So you still have that orginal with the gold
[4:16:52] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[4:17:02] akia03: @Kryssner ya but bot and gold selling companies would just buy tons of boosts and screw markets up
[4:17:04] andoba: @towelliee ive never boost a toon before. what do u get with it? does it comes with gear and weapon???
[4:17:23] Vivelli: you are doing a character copy to a "new" server if you wanna think of it that way
[4:17:35] Clicklesly: It's not a copy unless you pay for it ^^
[4:17:39] Clicklesly: Just a server transfer
[4:17:41] fans30: Do you think it'll be t0?
[4:17:42] Lokajin: ya 60 blue gear probably Dungeon 1 set style gear + 60% mount and a small bit of gold.
[4:17:59] Contendedlemon: do you think gold should transfer to bc? @Towelliee
[4:18:09] Dracolich_71: probably just enough gold to buy all of your talents to 58, then be broke, lol
[4:18:28] Numbnutt: do you need a lvl 60 already to purchase a boost without?

[4:18:32] Lokajin: Exactly
[4:18:43] doogs44: I think they should do some fresh servers as an option for ppl
[4:18:57] luckfore: ofcourse streamers say that :P
[4:19:01] nihilistic_bat: true
[4:19:01] Alegnowar: also btw weren't all those classic andy's "vanilla or die" why they care about tbc anyway? i guess they realized content isn't infinite whit classic LUL
[4:19:08] talmadimtv: not if it  was blood money
[4:19:21] andoba: @lokajin what 60% mount means???
[4:19:26] ZeethianDragon: just because someone has no gold and this person does doesn't mean that both should suffer and have nothing
[4:19:31] Lokajin: 60% movement speed mount @andoba
[4:19:35] Kryssner: Only loosers cry because ppl who played Classic have tons of gold
[4:19:43] GohthePandog: I feel that'd be weird if your character was just magically broke, huh? haha
[4:19:43] nintendyoh: People are so rude about this conversation. It comes down to Blizzard doing what they want and everyone still playing it :/.
[4:19:54] ZeethianDragon: LUL
[4:19:57] Moonori: most of the classic streamers farmed their gold
[4:20:13] bnzszn: Is Prot War gonna be strong in 9.0.5?
[4:20:20] crashoverride_gaming: Lol if they made the gold in classic and the expansion is bc why take away their gold???? It’s like the original project. #no changes
[4:20:23] MigoLyco: Prof buffed?
[4:20:27] Lokajin: Most of them have also made a crap ton of profession alts for tbc
[4:20:33] yoo3clipse: dumb question, what addon do you use for the covenant mission table?
[4:20:34] Nevermolly: those good old ride or die ppl
[4:20:38] manavomit: Ive watched a good handful of classic streamer get handed 1ks of gold every time they stream haha
[4:20:56] rocthenite: i am just leveling a mage and staysafe said mage sucks in tbc and now I am questioning
[4:20:57] akia03: @3clipseTv venture plan is best
[4:21:05] talmadimtv: @Towelliee im waiting for classic wotlk bc i miss blood dps
[4:21:11] Colt_Engineer: yo know bada bing bada boom
[4:21:18] Lokajin: @rocthenite they dont suck your just never gonna be the big dick dps
[4:21:25] yoo3clipse: @diathi123 ty
[4:21:26] Lokajin: youur always playing 2nd or 3rd fiddle to hunter/warlock
[4:21:41] Lokajin: but mage definitely isnt bad they pump
[4:21:45] MemoAcebo: hows prot war feeling, towel
[4:21:47] pk99: Most of them said bc was their real jam anyway
[4:21:51] bnzszn: Is Necro the way to go for Prot ?
[4:21:53] ZeethianDragon: it's just fact that TBC is better than classi
[4:21:54] akia03: @3clipseTv its not on curse tho search google and top one it is
[4:21:57] pk99: before announcement
[4:21:59] ZeethianDragon: arguements would be invalid
[4:22:08] toobaked1987: @Towelliee do you think you will find a good balance streaming TBC and SL??
[4:22:26] GiraffeHydra_: revenge?
[4:22:32] DerektheMetalhead: I know it's most likely been asked 50 times but any word on when we can buy the lvl 58 boost?
[4:22:34] armybone1: sure... you can stack the ignore pains
[4:22:50] blazeofhell: lol, bot druid stuck

[4:23:10] ZeethianDragon: I don't understand revenge on prot warriors. it barely does crap
[4:23:15] akia03: atleast combat condiuts will drop in raid now so less rng with venari
[4:23:16] armybone1: just the shield pain you still get 50% reduce dmg
[4:23:23] Alegnowar: i mean blizz will never overlap content for the 2 so ur good, tbc will come out as the 9.1 drought start
[4:23:29] armybone1: part*
[4:23:32] PhattAJ: Haven't played in a few years, i think i've got one of each class leveled to max. What class should i pick to level!?
[4:23:52] MigoLyco: @zeethiandragon it’s to maintain deep wounds on multiple targets
[4:23:57] nihilistic_bat: What class do you remember enjoying the most? Or one you haven't before
[4:24:00] GiraffeHydra_: @zeethiandragon puts the bleed on them, can proc free casts, plus theres a talent iirc that can make it hit pretty hard when its free
[4:24:07] bnzszn: Is Prot gonna be good in the next patch ?
[4:24:08] HyirGaming: HyirGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 104 months! towHAMUP

[4:24:54] andoba: im a 1st time wow player. decided to start with classic going to tbc. a lv58 boost will be underlevel for TBC right? everything tbc should be 60 correct. all enemies???
[4:24:58] pk99: We're aotc boys

[4:43:33] Zarinna2015: Totally agree
[4:43:34] ahla03: @Towelliee why do you think that? Shadowlands seems pretty succesfull
[4:43:34] ZeethianDragon: i doubt it's because of asmon
[4:43:44] LordOfDread: u think ppl got burned out?
[4:44:04] SteLawBro: People probably bored of watching the maw/same few dungeons/same broken pvp classes.
[4:44:23] luckfore: the content drought this expac will be terrible
[4:44:23] ahla03: Would 9.0.5 bring back the hype?
[4:44:31] Holy_Z: same reason almost half the people that started in SL are gone already
[4:44:39] Holy_Z: its cyclical
[4:44:47] Ambersulfr: 9.1 might
[4:44:50] coffeeatm: @Towelliee West
[4:44:50] Blistz1: Imma be honest, im not gonna resub til patch 9.1
[4:44:54] 0doz: @towelliee do you think that 9.p.
[4:45:05] geokouts: you passed it
[4:45:25] JackedNerd: bg pvp is a bunch of mythic people running around and owning people
[4:45:35] ZeethianDragon: Shadowlands just didn't really get it's point across after 3 months. The feeling of grind is mehh
[4:45:36] ahla03: @Towelliee do you think that tanking is worse this expansion too? Tanking on my protection paladin feels so bad...
[4:45:37] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:
[4:45:39] TheRealAxiom: @Towelliee You don't think spamming Dungeons are faster to level?
[4:45:45] memnon94: pvp is so unbalanced its not even fun
[4:45:45] ZeethianDragon: WoW is old
[4:45:47] 0doz: @towelliee do you think that 9.0.5 prot warrior changes are going to make the comunite perspective?
[4:45:50] Alegnowar: 9.1 is far away, blizz made it easy for ppl to loose interest on wow pretty quickly
[4:45:52] Getitonthelow: honestly thats how i am .. i love your channel but i barely been watching wow
[4:46:02] 0doz: to make a change*
[4:46:02] silentsword127: prot warrior gonna be new meta tank or what?
[4:46:30] Ambersulfr: Most of the streamers I see that still have audiences it’s because they talk to their fans like Towelliee does.
[4:46:36] ZeethianDragon: I think the maw drove peoples interest down pretty quicky with the no mounting up
[4:46:40] SteLawBro: I keep wanting to log in but then i ask myself, what are you going to do? Torghast? Nope. A dungeon you are bored to death of? Nope. PVP? Nope. Then i just dont log in. Been that way for like a month.
[4:46:41] ahla03: yeah but BC beta/news isn't content, we all know what BC will look like
[4:46:47] Holy_Z: it doesnt have required shit for people to do, but the world content that they do now is dogshit so it gets boring if you arent raiding/pvping/m+
[4:47:00] TheRealAxiom: unless your guild sucks and still pushing CE. Thats alot of content lol
[4:47:04] ZeethianDragon: every quest has like 2-4 parts to it.
[4:47:49] Holy_Z: LOL
[4:47:55] ZeethianDragon: THD
[4:47:57] ZeethianDragon: LUL
[4:48:00] CritcobainTV: i just want something to grind D:
[4:48:02] Trekxx: id rather do nothing than grind islands
[4:48:04] Trekxx: fuck that LUL
[4:48:08] Holy_Z: ^
[4:48:16] ahla03: I mean pushing high M+ is content no ?
[4:48:19] Rossii77: Grund stygia?
[4:48:32] Aidler: can you solo islands now?
[4:48:33] Draco_dragon666: i think 9.1
[4:48:40] xkennenx: i never played any expansion before BFA so im really excited to see what TBC is like an experience it
[4:49:07] buhtterstick: like the island of quel danas?
[4:49:07] Aidler: we need to be able to solo islands and all legion raids on all difficulties

[4:53:06] CritcobainTV: It's only this fast if you're a streamer and force people to carry you Kappa
[4:53:09] illistplays: can get 1-60 in 24 hours
[4:53:18] mmrghost7: this valor system is gonna backfire unless they fix it
[4:53:21] illistplays: retail is a meme LUL
[4:53:30] 91Niki: You're a meme
[4:53:31] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: 18 hrs ez
[4:53:33] illistplays: oh i know im just saying
[4:53:35] illistplays: its fast
[4:53:42] illistplays: its like
[4:53:45] pk99: Sometimes playing the patch meme is fun
[4:53:46] illistplays: stupid fast
[4:54:02] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: so mythic gear is barely better than ppl doing 5's ?? hmmm
[4:54:31] LordOfDread: i dont know why u need ksm, i feel like the system should be there to help get the achievement not the other way around
[4:54:49] Aidler: there is no way I‘m doing ksm
[4:55:17] magemaster225: I just wish theyd treat m+ like the third pillar they said and not a foot stump
[4:55:19] Sincline387: 210 to get to KSM
[4:55:20] ZeethianDragon: most of the playerbase doesn't even have KSM
[4:55:24] Lokajin: conq was locked at like 213
[4:55:26] SlayerLightStorm: Shadowlands Diplomat achieved, baby!
[4:55:27] ZeethianDragon: let alone have touched a 15
[4:55:35] Jesperoni: its just an alt gearing mechanic
[4:55:40] Sollice: It's Blizzard ( maybe Activision ) thought to slow drip content to keep players engaged to keep subs. They way they are doing it has completely turned off the player base and its causing MORE people to live
[4:55:42] Sollice: leave*
[4:55:43] buhtterstick: catch up mechanics don't come until next xpac announcement Kappa
[4:55:57] straza10: you people lol
[4:55:58] Alegnowar: they scared of elitist on twitter complaining
[4:56:08] Aidler: gating it for a shrinking player base. very clever... very clever
[4:56:23] Sollice: @Towelliee They are for SURE.

[4:56:25] armybone1: HahaSweat
[4:56:29] ZeethianDragon: makes the game feel worse and worse to play
[4:56:35] Lycam: Gating is a mechanism used when there's a lack of content.
[4:56:36] CanadianHellMoose: you can go up to 213 without ksm
[4:56:42] laughing_octopus: they actually thrown a used condom Sadge
[4:57:04] Lokajin: which 213 should be more then enough to get KSM
[4:57:09] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: The only issue is youll have people with 220 I lvl, and they wont understand any keys over +10, keys are already hard enough bc ppl cant learn
[4:57:13] mmrghost7: @CanadianHellMoose good luck getting ksm with 213 in this commnity Kappa
[4:57:27] Sollice: It's a mistake now to turn people off to the game. If New World is kind of good, lots of people will switch games
[4:57:30] ZeethianDragon: getting 15 on every dungeon would take a long time for the average player
[4:57:46] buhtterstick: I'm still level 53 4Head
[4:57:51] CanadianHellMoose: i'm pretty average =)
[4:57:51] ZeethianDragon: seems like they listen to those few who are pretty much tryharding the game
[4:58:04] Aidler: there must be some very uninspired people in the current Blizz management
[4:58:09] KingSlayerYotam: why there isnt a vendor like pvp have one?
[4:58:21] SlayerLightStorm: DING!
[4:58:25] Sollice: WoW is also just getting old. The keep the graphics updated but we have been playing WoW for 16 years. Thats a LONG TIME for a game. I think people are just getting kind of bored of it
[4:58:27] KingSlayerYotam: so i need to grind another the other side 30 times again for the scale
[4:58:44] wreckshoptv: did you get the quests in oribos for dungeons?
[4:58:52] CanadianHellMoose: i dont like the fact i have to reacquire my gear, but i dont mind the valor system
[4:58:53] Moobot: Calm the spam, @omar2130 (warning)
[4:59:10] Sollice: Blizzard would EASILY be king again if they made something new. Like a Startcraft MMO
[4:59:11] ZeethianDragon: pretty pissed
[4:59:15] schwarzi12: why is my message deleated ?
[4:59:15] MrFuzzynuts420: makes me want to uninstall the game
[4:59:16] filos0phia: do you think that's a bug? @Towelliee
[4:59:23] pk99: Not even doing m+ so i don't feel that pain
[4:59:25] ZeethianDragon: You gotta redo it ALL
[4:59:28] filos0phia: they did the same thing with added corruptions with the corruption vendor
[4:59:31] SlayerLightStorm: About the equivalent of Goku going SSJ4 @Towelliee
[4:59:34] fistofnature: got bis chest and legs in 203 :/
[4:59:36] Balzofsteels: will gear still be 200 then you upgrade ?

[4:59:45] luckfore: havent touched m+ at all this expac i only clear CN every week
[4:59:46] ZeethianDragon: they made it clear it's intentional
[4:59:46] Trekxx: got to keep people playing the game LUL
[4:59:47] Sollice: @omar2130 Moobot didn't like your /
[4:59:48] ZeethianDragon: very clear.
[4:59:51] CanadianHellMoose: tech reasons they said
[4:59:54] filos0phia: weird, I thought it was the same as what happened when they added the corruption vendor and we couldn't corrupt old items
[4:59:55] Ambersulfr: They really should’ve let people upgrade current gear

[5:00:01] 91Niki: @Towelliee Yeah that's what turns me off about that system. I got a bunch of gear that's basically useless. I just can't be bothered to play yet .
[5:00:11] jackthepackyak: we don't have the technology Kappa

[5:00:13] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee It such a scummy Blizzard move too. "we'll give you what you want, but you gotta do it all over again HAHAHA!"....
[5:00:13] cruzeal: "tech reasons"
[5:00:20] Jesperoni: @omar2130 you have to subscribe AND buy the shadowlands expansion

[5:00:21] filos0phia: they'll probably change it then
[5:00:22] Balzofsteels: i grind my shaman to 225 im out of shadowland
[5:00:27] ZeethianDragon: "TECH reasons" so many excuses
[5:00:28] Sollice: Yeah, the reason is they want you to regrind new gear and then grind for valor
[5:00:29] jackthepackyak: tech reasons LUL
[5:00:29] Ablackdruid: kinda different but I feel ya
[5:00:32] filos0phia: give em a few weeks and we can start upgrading old gear
[5:00:37] filos0phia: bet
[5:00:41] Savagehugo1: see the thing is all the top teams would grind leech gear or avoidance. and upgrade it in 9.0.5.
[5:00:43] alicebreh: yup
[5:00:44] Aidler: @towelliee stop doing M+ till 9.0.5. everybody should stop till 9.0.5
[5:00:44] ZeethianDragon: you aren't.
[5:00:56] noosphear: I think its because this was intended for 9.1, but they realized they needed to put it out earlier.
[5:01:02] CanadianHellMoose: i think "tech reasons" cause they didnt have time to do it properly
[5:01:03] ZeethianDragon: You took several months to get this gear?? well fuck you, you gotta get it ALL again.. isn't that fun???????
[5:01:05] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee we call this "Content Longevity". Love, blizz
[5:01:21] luckfore: and by the time you have fully upgraded 9.1 will release with higher rewards
[5:01:25] SlayerLightStorm: This is the EXACT reason I haven't done ANY Mythic+.
[5:01:25] 91Niki: @Towelliee Like trust me, i actually WANT to play. But idk, atm it feels so unrewarding. And i don't wanna have to regrind all my gear just to feel rewarded. If that makes sense
[5:01:34] Clicklesly: It is kinda ironic how this is a great week for pushing and people don't wanna do it ^^
[5:01:45] laaxxxd: is prot warrior gonna be good in 9.0.5 ? :)
[5:01:47] ZeethianDragon: what's the fucking point of even doing the maw since you can't upgrade current gear after this patch..
[5:01:48] 91Niki: Yeah

[5:02:01] 91Niki: Feels like they are just throwing anything against the wall atm to see if it sticks lol
[5:02:08] Fl3tchTTV: @towelliee you should save your renown turn ins for when you need to get to the next covenant quest breakpoint. with the two weeklies and four zone quests you only need 7 renown total to finish covenant campaign
[5:02:10] Jesperoni: LUL
[5:02:10] Vivelli: LULW
[5:02:12] filos0phia: lmao nf thi entire time
[5:02:14] buhtterstick: Sounds like I'm better off leveling my character for tbc

[5:03:07] buhtterstick: TIL H&R block is still around
[5:03:23] Coaltino: Hi tally
[5:03:26] VoidAbyssTV: i got so tired of grinding for gear and getting nothing fo months i just stopped playing.
[5:03:38] lokthara235: after 2 days 23 renown grind isnt bad lol
[5:04:00] 91Niki: @VoidAbyssTV I started playing Diablo 3 cuz i was so bored. Now I got more gear than i know what to do with LUL
[5:04:29] Sollice: Why would they do that. Keep you playing to regrind renown lol
[5:04:45] Sincline387: they'll just add more ways to get it....Take a flight path +1 renown
[5:04:59] lithium364: 9.3 swap covenants regrind 200 renown levels
[5:05:25] BackDoorWillie: hi,  so how is the expansion?
[5:05:27] akia03: just going to suck months stuck at renown 40
[5:05:32] Inflex873: !camera
[5:05:41] mrelgaato: !cam
[5:05:41] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[5:05:49] ZeethianDragon: 80 renown. 40 weeks of grinding LUL  if that happened
[5:05:56] illi333: shadowlands was a flop, no loot, no new abilities. boring af
[5:06:00] Throdio: The only thing I can see them make you do is the quests to progress, but allow you to do them all in a day
[5:06:05] VoidAbyssTV: @91Niki I went to FF14 and having a lot more fun, i still love wow but they need to fix something. if i have been grinding mythic+ and raid for months and the only gear ive seen is from the fault. something is wrong there
[5:06:08] chow_yun_phap: !command
[5:06:11] BackDoorWillie: ty illi💗👍
[5:06:15] akia03: first weeks give 3 renown tho @zeethiandragon
[5:06:22] burnt420: LUL
[5:06:26] VoidAbyssTV: Vault*
[5:06:27] manji123: is prot warrior more fun than pally ?
[5:06:35] Padarius: Hello all
[5:06:39] ZeethianDragon: @diathi123 if it happened while renown was still 2 per week instead of 3 like it was early
[5:06:46] ZeethianDragon: it would not be a great time period
[5:06:55] 91Niki: @VoidAbyssTV Yeah, I am so turned off from the fact that I am rewarded with gear once a week lol. I love wow, but nah. They need to fix something indeed. I've been having fun mindlessly slaying demons in Diablo 3 though LUL
[5:06:59] akia03: @zeethiandragon ya but 9.1 has more campaign quests
[5:07:25] ZeethianDragon: I just wanna afk in the air
[5:07:31] Draco_dragon666: true
[5:07:38] t0pgun_: same
[5:07:41] ZeethianDragon: same
[5:07:46] illi333: no one is going to farm anima, the rewards arent even worth
[5:08:04] akia03: esp revendreth be so much nicer with flying avoid that zone now
[5:08:15] ZeethianDragon: the cosmetics just like like dogshit tbh.
[5:08:19] Ambersulfr: I will go back to farming anima and herbs when I can fly
[5:08:40] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: prot feels awful bc you get rage stared, with 225 i lvl i struggle in 15s tanking, but on my 210 pally i crush 15s lol
[5:08:46] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: starved
[5:08:57] ZakuzaGB: can you imagine farming anima on all your alts tho
[5:08:57] Draco_dragon666: im only after mounts and toys
[5:09:00] ZeethianDragon: btw there is no night fae cosmetic sword
[5:09:01] magemaster225: its about 1.6 million anima to get every xmog/recolors with each armor type and 4 covenants
[5:09:25] ZeethianDragon: @magemaster225 monkaS
[5:09:33] Ambersulfr: I’ll probably do it only for my main in the current covenant it’s in 😂
[5:09:39] Ambersulfr: I don’t have that kind of time.
[5:09:45] zodd_amhai: zodd_amhai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! poop

[5:11:03] ZeethianDragon: sanctum just feels like a more useless garrison
[5:11:05] wetttnine: getting the 1k a week has been tough lately
[5:11:06] ZakuzaGB: they should have incorporated the class halls to the sanctums some how like you have a covenant area in the class order halls from legion
[5:11:11] Ambersulfr: At blizzcon that sounded like what they were saying... they like the current structures and they’re not changing them
[5:11:32] akia03: 9.1 will have maw sanctum outposts

[5:11:55] JoeyBagadonuts: Even if they cut anima costs in half, I still wouldn’t bother
[5:11:57] fluh_: i feel like once you get max renown aint no one doing the weekly anima quest anymore LUL
[5:12:22] akia03: the weeklies give 1500 gold and the other 500 anima not worth it
[5:12:25] Sincline387: there's lots of open areas in the sanctums for stuff to go in, especially maldraxus and kyrian
[5:12:27] Ambersulfr: Tbh I get it just raiding and doing m+
[5:12:31] CitizenStef: I've stopped doing it now LUL

[6:29:56] Exxcar: Idk, if DPS I don't know if Threads would be faster
[6:29:57] Jesperoni: when can you do m0s
[6:30:09] zeviika: ya if you dont get insta ques think campaign is faster than threads
[6:30:23] daveyman12345: play through the pain
[6:30:32] AcidSyndicate: DONG
[6:31:05] bertooso: Going necro?
[6:31:23] Repsifu: Hustle and Flow, my man @Towelliee
[6:31:29] chrslp: Im at 37 and the first half of the level takes an hour and the second half takes 3-4 hours
[6:31:29] Malvurak9109: No idea yet
[6:31:35] chrslp: like wtf
[6:31:43] bertooso: yeah i don't really want to swap but maybe i should Sadge
[6:31:44] zeviika: we might see them in m+ again finally
[6:31:50] Wildside1177: I have a 22 warrior in the barrens. Life gets rough somtimes
[6:31:53] 2prac: i just switched to venthyr as warlock, the spell is the coolest spell in wow atm
[6:32:16] zeviika: bertooso you dont have to. you would still be fine esp at lower content level. unless youre actually pushing high as ya can it probably wont make or break you
[6:32:17] HotHotHeals: less vengence DH's the better
[6:32:23] fistofnature: the banner should be BIGGER
[6:32:27] feherlofia123: reason i asked about gw 2 is ive been playing it for week , had burnout from wow... i find it interesting that a f2p game has "mythic" ... while a sub per month game like ff14 does not
[6:32:30] luckfore: so excited for the new patch! is the raid openeing a couple weeks later?
[6:32:44] feherlofia123: mythoc plus
[6:33:07] Exxcar: @luckfore this is only 9.0.5... 9.1 is still a ways off. So no new raid yet
[6:33:09] daveyman12345: my sister is level 40 and i am level 32 i think she is getting a divorce soon. i hope her son doesnt watch this stream
[6:33:12] RuthlessWelshy: there is no raid in this patch
[6:33:31] zeviika: feherlofia123 thats bc FF14 doesnt go towards that style of play. being the fastest isnt a thing in that game.
[6:33:42] zeviika: feherlofia123 xiv is a bit more casual and different way to play.
[6:33:56] bertooso: true
[6:33:58] wasabi_fabi: @Towelliee is windwalker monk still valid with 9.0.5? notes sound so...negative
[6:34:18] feherlofia123: @kurijomo last i checked reddit , people scream about having hard mode dungeons with affixes all the time
[6:34:19] laeenaravenholdt: laeenaravenholdt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! months Pogchamp
[6:34:35] zeviika: feherlofia123 in 14?
[6:34:40] feherlofia123: @kurijomo ye
[6:35:13] Holysal: WW rip
[6:35:19] RuthlessWelshy: yeah banner should be interesting
[6:35:23] zeviika: ya some would enjoy it. but as i said its a different gamestyle. made by square enix who doesnt really look at it the same way as wow. they only tolerate damage meters as long as you dont harass people about their performance
[6:35:33] zeviika: its just a different type of game and style
[6:35:37] Project_PC: is a new raid coming in 9.0.5?
[6:35:55] RuthlessWelshy: no
[6:35:59] feherlofia123: @kurijomo definitely not worth a monthly sub
[6:36:01] Exxcar: no @Project_PC
[6:36:07] GabCast81: what about the best prot warrior covenant for M+?
[6:36:16] Holysal: valor and class changes
[6:36:28] zeviika: feherlofia123 there is so much more to do than just m+ in a game you know lol. the amount that they put into the game and give way more regularly updated content makes it worth it tbh for me at least
[6:36:29] 3663Sharad: @GabCast81 Prolly kyiran, the phial is too good
[6:36:41] 3663Sharad: it least imo
[6:36:52] feherlofia123: @kurijomo i guess its a matter of taste
[6:36:56] GabCast81: @GabCast81 kk thx
[6:37:07] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee after you hit 60 you gonna do heroic now Kappa
[6:37:15] feherlofia123: the 14 story had me falling asleep from 60 to 80
[6:37:26] CraftyClaw: Arms warrior legendary is getting doubled in damage bonus too
[6:37:29] zeviika: feherlofia123 ya for that game i do savages and ultimates . for wow i do m+. they couldnt really do m+ since a lot of it is scaling and ilevel scaling dungeons which would not be as good.
[6:37:44] zeviika: and the shadowbringers storyline and stormblood was really really good but like you said matter of taste
[6:37:55] zeviika: they are more actual rpg and storytelling because it is, a Final Fantasy game lol
[6:38:08] Repsifu: what do  you think about the Zandalari Trolls being Prot Wars ? mostly because of their Racial
[6:38:14] zeviika: will you play 16 on strim when it is out Towelliee ?
[6:38:23] 3663Sharad: Im not sold to the Reprisal leggy. In theory its strong, but you have to move quite a bit to make use of it after your initial pull
[6:38:33] 2prac: Vulpera
[6:38:42] Frask81: goblin iirc
[6:38:44] Holysal: vulpera prob
[6:38:47] Frask81: for the jump
[6:38:53] fivz__: nah, belf
[6:38:55] zeviika: vulpera master race
[6:39:03] Coffins85: I am pretty sure he ws BELF
[6:39:04] Holysal: first hit dmg reduction
[6:39:52] Keyastaron_: FF 16
[6:40:00] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee
[6:40:02] zeviika: vulpera racial actually is pretty nice for healing over the course of a dungeon. it adds up
[6:40:02] Mitchiegan: de other side
[6:40:24] PotbellyGoat: Round 2 is offical
[6:40:30] zeviika: ya its pretty far away
[6:40:42] Agk90_: prolly 2030

[7:24:09] chickdrummer88: I'm happy I went through this pandemic on an island. We had to be super strict.

[7:24:29] OdysseyOG: im out on that vaccine. was in first pass and waived it
[7:24:38] jarilrpg: meanwhile here in florida, we have theme parks open and no restrictions mandated anywhere
[7:24:39] chrslp: Its crazy how the speed a state opens restrictions is directly correlated to the states majority political party LUL
[7:24:53] chickdrummer88: I'm still waiting for my phase to be able to get the shot since military has it a bit different than civilians

[7:43:32] XarkoLP: i missed the killing Raptors thing the last hours.
[7:43:33] DismalRNG: It just seems that everyone expects the tank to be perfect. Gotta start somewhere
[7:43:34] Fl3tchTTV: @DismalRNG If you are newer to tanking on your class, I recommend leveling a separate character of that spec through tanking random dungeons. Adds the difficulty in very gradually and builds confidence in your keybinds and UI and skills.
[7:43:45] Malnar1123: It's an investment. If your iLvL is accepted into +7's...run 3's and 4's...run easier content to give you more room for error and become more confident...then clwoly step it up
[7:43:51] Fl3tchTTV: then when you feel good, hop back to the main

[7:45:57] CardinalTX: Valheim is definatley a great distraction for awhile
[7:45:59] kranyoldlady: path of diablo for me :D
[7:45:59] jak3sterr: Valheim boring once you beat all the bosses :/
[7:46:01] KingofMeccano: tbh swtor is getting better after the last big patch with loads of fixes:)
[7:46:18] chrslp: Valheim is gonna die on Twitch completely within 2-3 months
[7:46:29] Mr_Pennywise_: a lot of people are also playing loop hero
[7:46:31] CardinalTX: i still hop om swtor from time to time
[7:46:32] Shurn_82: your characters can carry over
[7:46:48] Shurn_82: but it kinda metas
[7:46:50] Shurn_82: true
[7:46:58] snuffles_80: Valheim isnt out of early access yet and already sold 5 million copies
[7:47:14] ZeethianDragon: Valheim still has a lot to do
[7:47:15] Shurn_82: just say what I do "get on my fucking level and then call me' haha
[7:47:16] Osskssa: @chrslp who cares? they dont, over 5million sold
[7:47:21] ZeethianDragon: it's in early access
[7:47:24] blazzedzz: gotta beat it solo man!
[7:47:39] Shurn_82: @chrslp lol not likley
[7:47:50] Shurn_82: likely
[7:47:58] ZeethianDragon: @Osskssa it ssays they hve on multiple websites
[7:48:07] chrslp: People said Fall Guys wouldnt die on Twitch but how many streamers are playing it now LUL
[7:48:07] lolavarice: !TBC
[7:48:07] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[7:48:17] chrslp: Fall Guys sold even more copies than Valheim
[7:48:20] Osskssa: @zeethiandragon ????
[7:48:30] chrslp: Valheim is just flavor of the month
[7:48:33] MrGattz: but also remember just because streamers arint streaming it doesnt mean its dead
[7:48:41] Shurn_82: @chrslp 2 different style of games, hard to compare
[7:48:48] ZeethianDragon: Among Us is always poppin
[7:48:49] MrGattz: it just means its not profitable as much as it was
[7:49:01] crossfire_omg: GTA V RP is very popular
[7:49:02] Shurn_82: 5 million coppies sold is good coin to help dev
[7:49:05] MrGattz: to that specific audience
[7:49:09] Shurn_82: copies
[7:49:30] snuffles_80: well singel player games dont have months of content outside of speedruns after a while
[7:49:32] CardinalTX: I have never played GTA but watching the RP streams is fucking great
[7:49:45] blazzedzz: valheim isent just a streamer flavor game its a super fun solo adventure streamers just allways jump on the new pop in games
[7:49:50] griffdog125: lol i was on 4 hrs ago and you were in the same area
[7:50:06] Shurn_82: @boomeranng125 welcome to classic haha
[7:50:12] chrslp: People always get so defensive of games LUL I said Valheim will die on Twitch in 2 months. Yes people will still be playing it but once the new flavor of the month comes out, you'll barely see it streamed
[7:50:25] snuffles_80: gotta get those extra followers
[7:50:53] jakobsurfs: you see those university blues AF1s?
[7:50:57] Shurn_82: @chrslp people also talk shit about things they have no knowledge about
[7:51:20] snuffles_80: now they are all playing Loop Hero
[7:51:20] chrslp: @Shurn_82 Ok buddy LUL
[7:51:32] Aedarax: i would just take the 5m and dip KEKW
[7:51:33] MrGattz: they sold 5m copies
[7:51:34] GiraffeHydra_: @chrslp who would possibly argue against that? lol its only got so much content
[7:51:34] chrslp: Valheim is literally declining LUL
[7:51:39] Shurn_82: @chrslp you know you don't need to take everythign said personally, its gunna make your life miserable
[7:51:43] MrGattz: they made a SHIT ton of money for 5 people
[7:51:47] metavahn: or just pocket it Kappa
[7:51:56] Shurn_82: i watched cohh play it this morning
[7:52:00] Shurn_82: interesting concept
[7:52:02] Sepron14: Chrslp you cant say a game in Alpha is declining
[7:52:02] chrslp: @Shurn_82 I mean I didnt mention you once but you keep responding. But k
[7:52:04] TweakT: 1 mill each SeemsGood @MrGattz
[7:52:11] TweakT: jk KEKW
[7:52:13] GiraffeHydra_: @MrGattz last I checked, what, 4 mil copies? crazy for that amount of people
[7:52:24] MrGattz: @SensualMurderHornets yeah they said 5m like 4 days ago or something
[7:52:35] MrGattz: but also remember that valheim is ONLY 50% finished
[7:52:47] GiraffeHydra_: @MrGattz insane, but good on them, good devs should be encouraged to keep making shit
[7:52:48] Aedarax: they sold 5mil copies at 20$ each its like 100mil no?
[7:52:49] Shurn_82: @chrslp yea, referencing what you said , with my opinion   it happens in a chat...its gunna be ok 'bud'
[7:52:57] MrGattz: they plan on 9-10 bosses and a zone for each one plus massive updates to everything else.

[7:53:08] chrslp: @Shurn_82 Dude calm down LUL You're the one taking things personally here LUL
[7:53:08] TheZlare: 7 Days to Die is also another one
[7:53:10] xViewersunitedx: day z LUL
[7:53:13] Wulfgrym: h1z1
[7:53:14] snuffles_80: I watch Cohh build some amazing buildings things in vValheim
[7:53:16] Sollice: @Aedarax Steam takes a massive cut of the sales
[7:53:18] Sepron14: Okay in some cases you can then ;)
[7:53:23] MrGattz: yeah 7dtd is getting up there in age for still being in beta
[7:53:32] Shurn_82: @chrslp says the guy telling people talking in a chat to calm down lol
[7:53:32] Aedarax: @Sollice i didnt know that lol the more you know
[7:53:34] TweakT: how massive? @Sollice
[7:53:41] MrGattz: steam takes like 20-30%
[7:53:46] Sollice: Uhh I can look but I think 30%?
[7:53:49] MrGattz: depending on who you are
[7:53:53] chrslp: @Shurn_82 Ok buddy calm down
[7:54:11] TweakT: & then u have to pay taxes too Sadge
[7:54:35] TweakT: in Sweden that's like 40%
[7:54:43] Shurn_82: @chrslp when you express an opinion in a chat, people will discuss it.  people will talk and reply and hav a point of view on it, no need to get all hurt and try to make it about a personal attack, then spam 'calm down' to someone who has been having a normal converstation with you. . . seems you might be the one who needs to calm down
[7:54:51] Sollice: Yeah I never build. Thats why I am not a fan of games like RUst, Ark, Miecraft etc
[7:55:02] chrslp: Imaging telling someone to not take things personally and then type a paragraph
[7:55:03] TheZlare: Me and my friends spent like 2 and a half hours just sailing in the ocean trying to get to our base from the swamp
[7:55:12] TheZlare: On Valheim
[7:55:18] Shurn_82: @chrslp imagine having the logic of a paperclip
[7:55:26] Drogdorf: 2 PogChamp
[7:55:28] TweakT: or 52% because it's a large sum of money
[7:55:33] MrGattz: alright guys relax
[7:55:47] Sollice: Some of these collect items dont make sense. Like how does a raptor sometimes not give you a heart. Dont they all have hearts lol
[7:55:49] Shurn_82: ive been chill the whole time
[7:55:50] TheZlare: It's wild, but it takes forever lol
[7:55:55] Shurn_82: guys just taking shit personal
[7:55:56] GiraffeHydra_: @Sollice I can't do "pretty" shit to save my life, but I love making practical bases, satisfies my inner child "pillow fort" mania lol
[7:56:18] Sollice: Zombies is great to just get in and shoot shit
[7:56:25] TheZlare: ^
[7:56:42] Shurn_82: it was fun watching you play it too @Towelliee
[7:56:49] Sollice: Thats all I want to do. Get in get some stuff done and quit when I want. Thats why I love ARPGs like Diablo
[7:56:59] GiraffeHydra_: So anyways I started blastin
[7:57:01] Colt_Engineer: that's the sound it makes huh?
[7:57:01] Shurn_82: hell yea
[7:57:12] Shurn_82: sometimes you just need to blasty blast some zombies
[7:57:14] TweakT: it has dragones?
[7:57:30] metavahn: never heard of it
[7:57:36] Exxcar: I just want New World to get finished properlly and come out :D
[7:57:38] Exxcar: I can't wait
[7:57:39] Sollice: Its a side scrolling game
[7:57:39] KryingMoon: which game?
[7:57:55] Sollice: @Towelliee I am not watching it
[7:58:01] stallowned: wait, with eddy murphy?

[7:58:07] Phorsacken: @Exxcar Good man, being patient to play another game
[7:58:14] BRUTALIT0PS: If I don't watch it, the sequel never happened!
[7:58:14] kokochris: I loved the first one when I was a kid
[7:58:14] MrGrimms: I watched it yesterday, it wasn't amazing... nostolgic  but meh
[7:58:17] GiraffeHydra_: @Exxcar my feelings exactly, happy they paused it to make the pve better though
[7:58:20] Sollice: Coming to America 2 was a cash grab.

[8:03:59] luck64_: I was 16 when I started playing wow, I'm 33 now, oh god
[8:04:15] Aelissia: They have a lot of ideas, but my main issue with them is the monthly purchases to support the game. I hate it when a game offers things/loot for something that doesn't exist yet.
[8:04:24] snuffles_80: Im almost 41.. I played WoW vanilla Beta..
[8:04:32] luck64_: same lol
[8:05:10] Aelissia: you can buy mounts... but God knows if we'll ever be able to use them. Lol
[8:05:24] luck64_: got into vanilla closed beta with the file planet deal back then
[8:05:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: they've gone full Star Citizen Kappa
[8:05:28] Sollice: I wonder is Asmon has a problem with Ashes store mounts...you know since its a world breaking thing when WoW does it
[8:05:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: never go full Star Citizen
[8:05:37] Exxcar: That sounds like all the stuff you can buy for Star Citizen Kappa
[8:05:42] mythradrill: there are games still in pre alpha after 11 years and 450 million dollars later
[8:05:49] Neowanderer: the tree ent mount ftw
[8:06:11] izabeL: is there even 1 good mmo that cameout in the last 2 years?
[8:06:12] spekktrum19: Yea, it’s in the patch notes
[8:06:30] mythradrill: scum citizen
[8:06:44] Clicklesly: It is a scam ^^
[8:06:46] Sollice: They dont know what it is, thats why it hasnt been released
[8:06:47] kokochris: They dont either danLUL
[8:06:50] luck64_: it is life
[8:06:52] Aelissia: Bless Online had some minimal potential, but they destroyed that game.
[8:06:55] Sollice: it literally wants to be EVERYTHING
[8:06:56] MrGattz: star scam every citizen?
[8:06:57] GiraffeHydra_: in all fairness, they've made a looot of progress, its legit impressive from a technical standpoint
[8:06:59] mythradrill: i dont call a game mmo when u cant have more than 10 players in one place
[8:07:07] Broomba: every game that is a meme like Star Citizen is the Rick Rolled of gaming @towelliee
[8:07:09] Paramourn: It lets you spend money so he can buy his wife more  Manolos LUL
[8:07:24] Velashen: It’s boring that is for sure.
[8:07:26] popzoer: why no vid?
[8:07:27] Sollice: @SensualMurderHornets Yeah...Thats called a tech demo not a game

[8:08:01] GiraffeHydra_: @Sollice Hey, I said technical standpoint impressive, I didn't say shit about the game part :P
[8:08:08] Sollice: lol
[8:08:11] Clicklesly: What game?
[8:08:13] luck64_: hopefully valheim will inspire some fresh blood into some games
[8:08:28] Denohar: Denohar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[8:08:31] Vexxsis: it's all about ff14 endwalker
[8:08:35] Sollice: @ShruikanTV Should it? Whats so unique about Valheim
[8:09:08] MrGattz: @Sollice the funny thing is nothing. its not "unique" it just does a lot of things that other games do really really well
[8:09:12] GiraffeHydra_: @Sollice it proves that indie devs can make a killing if their product is good, if nothing else
[8:09:15] crotastar: I dont know when it will release, but I am hyped for the Star Wars RPG in development.
[8:09:16] FistoTheFistybot: Sollice Its the only game that's called Valheim
[8:09:20] Sollice: lol
[8:09:32] Sandman_88: @Vexxsis actual game that lives up to the hype
[8:09:36] Clicklesly: So basically what WoW did ^^
[8:09:48] Sollice: Yeah but its nothing new really. Does it really inspire anyone to go out and make something completely unique
[8:09:56] Vexxsis: @sandman_88 SeemsGood
[8:10:12] GiraffeHydra_: @Sollice yep, because they see "holy shit it made how much money? lets work our asses off"
