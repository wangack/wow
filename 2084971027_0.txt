[2:17:50] billybaroo1: gauntlet legends has a huge screen compared to ms. pacman
[2:18:41] Mongeeser: When you turn on or off your monitor, the static electricity built up on the screen is discharged, resulting in the popping sound. Another cause of monitor pop is the expansion and contraction of the monitor's components due to temperature changes. When the monitor is turned on, the components heat up and expand.

[2:20:06] Airwaive: Do these big monitors have coil whine
[2:20:07] Stingray427: classic IP
[2:20:19] auberginekartoffel: In electronics, electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a process that occurs when an electrically insulating material (a dielectric), subjected to a high enough voltage, suddenly becomes a conductor and current flows through it. All insulating materials undergo breakdown when the electric field caused by an applied voltage exceeds the material's dielectric strength. The voltage at which a given insulating object becomes conductive.
