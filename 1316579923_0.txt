[1:15:26] Rictamar: @bowsers1 they are railing against the awful monetization, and its not okay that the game does this, simple as that
[1:15:32] bypized: @Towelliee why are people playing pretend that Immortal is the only game that has this kind of monetization?
[1:15:37] n3fwearsatoupee: what should i buy in this game?
[1:15:49] sniperpotion: I got the battle pass and I‚Äôm not gonna get anything else
[1:15:50] MetYoYO25: Sorry if Probably have answered but is the game cross save on pc and phone?
[1:15:54] Rictamar: @bypized people aren't at all, they are pointing out another terribly monetized game
[1:15:55] bypized: @Gylduran Is it in the companies rights to do it?
[1:15:55] tedol: @n3fwearsatoupee  just grind
[1:16:02] bowsers1: @Gylduran lol you did not watch Asmongold stream ? it's like people are discovering mobile game and thinks it's just Blizzard doing that shit
[1:16:03] Whew2you: any room in the guild?
[1:16:05] wolfster72: wolfster72 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:16:07] bindek_: but the monetization is not such a big deal, people who havent even played the game making assumptions
[1:16:08] dj_goasoul: no need 5 star gems for pvp?
[1:16:11] Rictamar: @bypized sure, and they should be crucified for it
[1:16:19] n3fwearsatoupee: battle pass $5 or the other one?

[1:17:22] bowsers1: ''Lost ark is less monetized than Immortal '' comparing pc game to mobile game LUL
[1:17:28] blossomcamm: people just like complaining for sake of complaining this isn't anything new LUL
[1:17:28] Aquadriel: Im lvl 30 havent spent a single dime, the time i am 'required' to spend, i might stop playing. No need to make a twitter thread about it lmao.
[1:17:34] adelius3: I had lots of fun leveling to 30 yesterday. Accept the game for what it is IMO
[1:17:41] adelius3: You can play without paying
[1:17:43] adelius3: thats the whole point
[1:17:55] Rictamar: Asmon's viewers don't represent the gaming community's opinions on monetization, they are just some
[1:17:59] Rictamar: stop being dumb chat
[1:18:00] metavahn231: gaming is dead if this goes to mainstream games, but if it stays on these cheap mobile games dont really care
[1:18:03] bypized: That is the whole point
[1:18:17] Aquadriel: @Towelliee something people dont get about the monetization on this game is... this game has NO ADS unlike 95% of mobile games around.
[1:18:22] BelacKriv: It's also odd people saying that they won't play the game, but the best way to show that the community doesn't like microtransactions is just to play for free.
[1:18:28] bowsers1: Blizzard should have not make Immortal on PC , too much backlash , people compare Immortal monetization , graphics to PC games LUL
[1:18:35] Allteck22: The idea of this style of monetization is the issue. Accepting it as the norm is a part of the problem.
[1:18:36] tedol: @Gylduran  he had 100k viewers yesterday,his opinion will dominated minds for sometimes
[1:18:37] bypized: @Gylduran thank you for being the hero we all needed in this world. Please go to Blizzard HQ and tell them how they should do things for a mobile game
[1:18:41] mavericks312: @elixirfield1 i highly doubt you would see this type of monetization in d4
[1:18:51] timebxz: hey do we have enough shadow sing it's for the clan??
[1:18:58] timebxz: it's in clan details
[1:19:00] Rictamar: Diablo Immortal's monetization is some of the worst in the industry, and its sad its not the only game to do this

[1:31:28] bypized: @Towelliee what happened to chat today? Freaky friday in chat

[1:31:33] Draaieenei: Is there hardcore mode?
[1:31:38] felpudinii: @Aquadriel yeah just use the official pc version from battlenet
[1:31:39] tedol: @blossomcamm  okk
[1:32:14] tedol: !server
[1:32:14] Moobot: @tedol Towelliee is playing on End of Days server for Diablo Immortal || New World Server US EAST - MAMMRAAAMA
[1:32:16] Aquadriel: reggiepowa it is just an improved engine from d3, is not supposed to look like fucking battle field bro.
[1:32:17] kokochris: !server
[1:32:18] Frank4LuLz: i got your bone golem right here
[1:32:36] the_viznar: if I'm just a PC player -- would you say DI is better than D3?
[1:32:49] blossomcamm: @bypized its pretty comical lmao
[1:32:59] bindek_: yep
[1:33:01] tedol: should be
[1:33:05] bindek_: thats what rich does
[1:33:05] Draz3nx: yes viz
[1:33:09] shibbsyyy: yes sir
[1:33:12] Frank4LuLz: sure
[1:33:13] MoonwalkingAngel79: graphics are decent rinds me d3
[1:33:26] Deadcells: Doing another?
[1:33:38] tedol: in d3 for high rifts you getting lik 20 legos, so it's not even that much
[1:33:40] HealPleaseHeal: bottom right?
[1:33:42] Aquadriel: thevizbear it builds from d3, so it has some better things than d3 for sure, plus has better story telling. But the moment you get to the money part it just loses a lot of value, imo.
[1:33:44] TBogGr1ndz: many things seem like copy/paste from D3
[1:33:45] mrpresbaby: bottom right of bag
[1:34:08] mrpresbaby: jeweler to upgrade
[1:34:09] tedol: you an upgrade them
[1:34:10] adelius3: yes you can DE the gems and upgrade others... somewhere
[1:34:14] the_viznar: @Aquadriel thanks for the breakout!
[1:34:19] crismo2: Is ther a way my payed stuff only shows is my problem too.
[1:34:22] Zimmygee: Ya you use the lower rank ones to upgrade your better/chosen ones

[1:34:32] Rictamar: I mean, Toweliee's chat is full of Blizzard shills so any criticism levelled at a Blizzard game and people lose their minds
[1:34:33] Aquadriel: @thevizbear no probs homie
[1:34:45] mrpresbaby: that's why you have all those red dots
[1:34:49] tedol: check it, I don't have much of legendary gems
[1:34:49] mrpresbaby: you need mats to upgrade
[1:34:59] timebxz: yes to upgrade your gems you put a gym into it and for the legendaries no it didn't take too much to get to level two I think the higher the level the more Stone it's only like one or two for two star
[1:34:59] adelius3: you have to tell us we dont have 11 legendary crests :D
[1:35:11] bypized: @Towelliee Is Blizzard considering this a successful launch yet? I imagine so? Would love to see the financial numbers
[1:35:12] mrpresbaby: next to each armer item is a red dot
[1:35:18] Zimmygee: its a little complicated but jeweler will show you. sometimes you need speicific gems to upgrade. then theres also a general "disenchant" dust
[1:35:24] mrpresbaby: it means you can upgrade the item and/or the gem
[1:35:36] adelius3: no server issues, can we get a moment to praise that
[1:35:38] tedol: @bypized  it's not d3 launch, that allready good
[1:35:43] mavericks312: there making million+win lol
[1:35:45] bvbdragon: you get the first thing on the yellow quest before the one you have now, maybe forgot too loot before?
[1:35:47] Moobot: Teinseii, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[1:35:59] Teinsei_: ok thxx
[1:36:02] MoonwalkingAngel79: probably big numbers in asia they love west games alot
[1:36:02] mrpresbaby: that means upgrade @Towelliee
[1:36:10] mrpresbaby: you should probably go to the blacksmith after this
[1:36:34] mavericks312: just wait for the asia release of this ga,e
[1:36:42] Frank4LuLz: GUIDE? were
[1:36:44] mavericks312: game*
[1:36:59] tedol: you can convert them
[1:37:06] Teinsei_: Just saying that this game is really good but really a shame thats its ...
[1:37:27] Foogs44: games are so overcomplicated now
[1:37:27] Zimmygee: right,  so you wanna upgrade your higher stars first
[1:37:27] shibbsyyy: no that stays the same you dont wanna blow through mats
[1:37:37] felpudinii: dont waste it on a 1-star PepeHands
[1:37:38] Frank4LuLz: when this games hits china, be like when John Cena went native....straight crazy
[1:37:53] Zimmygee: probably not.. atleast get a x/5 star
[1:37:56] ziko713: basically wait for 5 stars or waste your stuff
[1:37:57] shibbsyyy: i wouldnt even think you use em on a 2 star
[1:38:04] Zimmygee: 2 star is max for f2p tho
[1:38:18] tedol: @Zimmygee  you can craft them
[1:38:29] Shaele: no you dont
[1:38:34] Shaele: 2 star is the ceiling atm
[1:38:49] stillduckymx: tru
[1:38:57] dj_goasoul: should we buy only "fa"s ?
[1:39:00] Zimmygee: true.. you get 2-3 legendary crests a month as f2p.. so theres a "chance"
[1:39:11] mavericks312: china fin to drop 10 mil on release lol
[1:39:23] ziko713: fa is gonna be the best to rng the 5 stars
[1:39:33] Frank4LuLz: Blizzard be making Trillions on all the whales
[1:39:59] MoonwalkingAngel79: did ya finish story?
[1:40:09] Aidler: I also believe this launch was successful. the echo chambers of agitated anti monetization gamers doesn‚Äôt accurately reflect reality
[1:41:04] VerySneaky84: Imagine thinking anti-monetization is a bad thing
[1:41:13] tedol: @Allteck22  let's wait for d4 and how servers will crash in first  20 sec
[1:41:16] Aidler: I don‚Äôt
[1:41:18] Rictamar: @Aidler the MTX is trash and predatory though, you surely can agree on that right? Its sad they decided to go this way imo and embrace the cancer mobile market
[1:41:25] Aquadriel: for every 10 mofos bitching about mtx, theres a whale who spends money equal to those 10 mofos needs KEKW
[1:41:26] bluetip84: so if the game just a button masher or is it challenging at all?
[1:41:36] Aidler: but I‚Äôm also a realist
[1:41:44] Brodih_: towBook  that no gem guy!
[1:41:45] bindek_: do you think they are gonna optimize this game for pc in the future? like custom res, zoom, UI changes
[1:41:46] felpudinii: i wanna leech like this guy KEKW
[1:41:54] sniperpotion: @bluetip84 it‚Äôs Diablo lol

[1:42:01] BigJustin26: tbh in gacha games, the bulk of the money the company makes isn't from the 1% whales. it's from the 60% of the playership who does like a daily dollar here or there for refreshes or lootboxes
[1:42:04] MoonwalkingAngel79: i kinda feel ripd off as gamer in eu where my country doesnt get to play games with lootboxes i feel like i lost as a gamer cause now i cant play these games

[1:42:41] feherlofia123: dunno what the fuzz is about , game seems fine to me so far
[1:42:42] zystin88: this game is a big W for mobile IMO
[1:42:43] tedol: that Wizard
[1:42:49] MoonwalkingAngel79: i dont have a pc
[1:43:03] TalkSlickN: how much have we spent so far?
[1:43:05] abracka_: there's people selling +15 rifts on my server lmao

[1:44:42] MoonwalkingAngel79: im living by myself dude i cant afford much luxury i have to life with what i got
[1:44:43] 91Niki: @KFix Officially launched on mobile, in beta on pc
[1:44:43] h_u_r_k_: yes
[1:44:43] zechetto: Zod was the highest rune in D2, I believe
[1:44:53] tedol: Nekro will love this one
[1:44:53] KFix: oh
[1:44:55] feherlofia123: @kfix it is, but they made a port of it on battlenet
[1:45:05] KFix: nice
[1:45:08] tedol: lol
[1:45:13] PvtHudson093: Son of Dur-El kneel before Zod, Snoochie Boochies
[1:45:13] 91Niki: @KFix It's shared between mobile and pc though. So progress carries over :D

[1:45:33] KFix: @KFix cool!
[1:45:48] Hypertitan: it's an edgy name I know
[1:45:48] OwnerKing: @MoonwalkingAngel for sure bro, just letting u know u can play most games with a $600 build if u buy used. PCs are also good for learning new things like coding or graphics and such which could lead to more money
[1:46:04] 91Niki: No tits allowed Kappa
[1:46:05] Zimmygee: Too much hype
[1:46:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: HaxzorJimDuggan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[1:46:49] 91Niki: @Hypertitan Gotta rename to HyperFruitbasketan Kappa

[1:48:49] Kinetsu: @Towelliee gear ius RNG
[1:48:51] Kinetsu: *is
[1:49:01] shibbsyyy: gear is just rng always a chance
[1:49:24] rGianii: My game doesn't start anymore Sadge
[1:49:26] SpenceSir: Yes Towelliee! im copying your build, hope you dont mind. You got any cool legos? And you know any BiS gear?
[1:49:42] Hypertitan: k back to lurking while I work...
[1:49:55] Kinetsu: Ive got 4 to drop this morning
[1:50:03] Cataclaw: this looks like a mobile game
[1:50:18] PvtHudson093: Got to get that taste of getting good loot before rng fucks you
[1:50:32] TheAlmightyTuj: Gee i wonder why @cataclaw
[1:50:38] Coughing_Coffin: I know for some of the regular dungeons, the guide book will say something like ‚Äúhas a chance to drop legendary and set gear on Hell 1+ difficulty‚Äù but I don‚Äôt remember setting a difficulty for the game
[1:50:41] Cataclaw: why play a mobile game on PC?
[1:50:48] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce
[1:50:53] felpudinii: @Cataclaw why not ?
[1:51:14] Rudric_Ice: @cataclaw that's how real gamers play
[1:51:20] Pisteroni: I get headaches from playing mobile games too long
[1:51:31] Pisteroni: can play it on the pc though :)
[1:51:37] felpudinii: EZ
[1:51:38] Zimmygee: Pog
[1:51:52] 91Niki: @Pisteroni Probably related to the neck position of looking down. I get that too if looking at my phone for too long
[1:52:16] Trawkey: You got the bis shield
