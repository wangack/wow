[0:38:02] Heavydk: @Maximum Do you think the team coming out of the upper bracket should have some kind of an advantage in the finals (Such as having 8 maps in the pool, allowing the "upper" team to ban 2) Since they have not lost anything while the team coming from lower "finals" already lost 1 series.... feels kind of weird that you can win everything but the finals and still just lose overall, while all other teams could lose 1x game but still have a chance at the #1

[0:58:57] totemicmender4: How the heck do u survive without a healer? What are they doing to not really take that much damage?
[0:59:01] sadalxx: @Phixius No it does not. They are talented, but removing a role from a tournament shows that either they need to do higher keys, or healing needs to be looked at

[1:32:22] Spartany25: dont forgot the choice between st and aoe
[1:32:32] datewitheffi: Saying VE is strong here is because the pack dies in 8 seconds. In high keys its nice but not insane

[1:34:05] gwenmh: warlock is like they put an endgame poe character into wow for no reason
[1:34:06] Basic_3: Warlocks sucked in S2
[1:34:06] AbieCherry: @Maximum vers in S3 because of tier set
[1:34:07] PPowzer74: vers + hp stacking
[1:34:13] hucking: warlock is so unfun this tier
[1:34:14] FireKatLuL: lock needs an immunity tbh

[1:34:40] Axcelll: my outlaw rogue has like 20% reduced dmg taken from vers right now KEKW
[1:34:40] Finnomenon: playing verslock is awful, it feels like shit
[1:34:41] rezalis_: vers stacking is such a boring damage scaling
[1:34:41] se_enginheiro: Destro doesnt stack that much tbf

[1:50:44] Shirey12: 39 with a head like that? JB looks qualified for AARP
[1:50:53] reggiepowa: I dont think thats going to happen, gearing is already pretty op
[1:50:58] Basic_3: Their core philosophy is you can't gear your alts from your main, so IDK about that happening.
[1:51:04] dlllont: DF was a big step forward from SL in alt regard
[1:51:08] greenmachine11235: So many more trash toons doing content they have ZERO ability for
[1:51:12] zenkodac: For sure watching how it affect the race is gona be interresting

[1:51:32] Quiznuhtodd: If they make crests available to all alts then I give DF 8/10
[1:51:38] shinta__: he said the S word Madge
[1:51:44] zenkodac: Rep and achivment
[1:51:45] TheZIXIS: gear, achievments, reps, craft mats
[1:51:48] Basic_3: @SlowboLaggins It's going to be LFR/Normal ilvl gear
[1:51:48] dlllont: first we have warbands. then its a slippery slope to corruptions
[1:51:49] kj01a: Dont need achievemetns. HOW DARE YOU?!
[1:51:50] xqtza: hey young sir
[1:51:52] Synk_live: alts take gear and TIME, which is the more important factor
[1:51:52] gonzi86: gear takes a long time when you only play an hour or two a day
[1:51:54] nevotheless: not all rep on release but dragonflight renown
[1:51:54] lolaustin: Rep being across account is good for people who want multiple crafters
[1:51:59] yonima: loamn?
[1:52:01] B3AR1TAS: rep is big because of profession things that you have to get if you do that part of the game
[1:52:04] flabstv: head enchant rep

[2:10:43] d0mezg4mer: honestly I don't believe it's really "random" I think someone gets banned for gold buying then lies and say they didn't random ban
[2:10:45] Protomateria: GDKP is cringe
[2:10:48] dubiusdingus: I didn't even want to raid in classic cause of it
[2:10:50] mrtiimmy: my guildie got banned for someone paying him back 100mil gold kek
[2:10:51] knuuuunt: gdkp should just be deleted. the "Bad" outweighs the "Good"
[2:10:52] miraagex: true. gold inflated a lot. trinkets go for like 300k gold
[2:10:53] AUTiger0325: @TroyThe2nd It's alright.  I'm old so I have a good job.  Turbo is pretty cheap considering.
[2:10:54] woltk2024: GDKP just make raiding trash
[2:10:55] Nox1o: i prefered gdkps because every other group was filled with people worse than monkeys
[2:10:56] Jumanjiqt: Regular groups do exist but they're filled with some of the worst players in the game
[2:10:56] shadowreath93: glad they removed GDKP SEE YA
[2:10:57] sockenpeter: bla
[2:10:58] greyst: That's just not true at all. There were WAY more regular runs than GDKP's at every point in every version of Classic/SOD

[2:11:12] theDirtyon3: Why the fuck do you need that much gold in classic?
[2:11:12] fleks27: i have traded several hundreds of gold to lend to mates and i didnt get banned, this "they just randomly ban" is the biggest cope
[2:11:15] OldManBel: You leave my alts out of this!
[2:11:17] Zingerac: I'd say about 80% of the people that I knew in classic/SOD bought gold
[2:11:18] brodiebrohan: GDKPs bad but carries on rental good?

[2:12:14] knuuuunt: People saying they didn't buy gold but got banned are just lying about buying gold.
[2:12:17] Zawisza_Czarny: farming gold in classic is waste of time cuz there's to many bots. its better to spend 20 pound for 100g than farm that 100\g for few hours
[2:12:22] theDirtyon3: LOL
[2:12:26] fleks27: people are just entirely unaware to how many people blatantly lie

[2:22:53] Scoops__: but what if it was intentional monkaHmm
[2:23:10] bartholimu: @cptrogers123 HUH
[2:23:12] LuiBMHunter: @alestrom23 we just have more levels than these noobs :)
[2:23:14] scottyjet: what is this dungeon's name?
[2:23:14] snotrich: task failed successfully
[2:23:21] Nox1o: so it was an echo exclusive
[2:23:28] alstadi: there was some strat that involved going out of the dungeon
[2:23:42] guynormally: it worked though, they're at morchie now
[2:23:43] vente97: maybe some time trial tech that's not allowed
[2:23:43] Nox1o: that really sucks for them that they had to use it then
[2:23:48] Finnomenon: KEKW
[2:23:54] Lenzoface: meeres said that figured this tech right b4 the cup I think?
[2:23:56] VIEGAS_PT: ye
[2:23:56] KDaily: this is just like echo doing the Brackenhide last boss strat. seems cheap because they make it look easy but actually so hard to pull off in a live setting
[2:23:56] aERB3: what level keys are they running?
[2:23:57] elpotatto: they could've done some varince of the tech
[2:23:58] Nox1o: different tech for sure
[2:24:11] DylanWRX: echo sandbagged themselves
[2:24:13] VIEGAS_PT: thats crazy
[2:24:15] hxzcc: Susge
[2:24:17] SherlockFPS: How are they teleporting, i just came to stream
[2:24:18] TroyThe2nd: i have actually no fucking idea wtf is going on in this dungeon
[2:24:19] kari0707: @aERB3 23
[2:24:19] bartholimu: @aERB3 bottom left
[2:24:20] lucashowmuchpain: they prob just had another class doing it no?
[2:24:21] VIEGAS_PT: they would flex
[2:24:31] aERB3: oh word, ty
[2:25:04] guynormally: @SherlockFPS riftmages in the sand room that drop those useless portals can be snapped into the boss rooms making the portals actually useful
[2:25:07] Nox1o: imagine having so much tech that you gotta hold back in multiple dungeons because people wouldnt believe you can do it natty
[2:25:30] SherlockFPS: @guynormally holly, how are they managing that
[2:25:36] not_Hivee: You can ONLY do it in a premade
[2:25:43] not_Hivee: No way you do this shit with pugs
[2:25:46] Nox1o: legendary had half the tech though
[2:26:00] gfkoe: dont you have to kill the riftmage to open the portal?

[2:26:02] Nox1o: against a non tech route they were like 2 minutes faster iirc
[2:26:20] Crazia: Legandary are pretty sick as well, the AD was awesome
[2:26:34] guynormally: @SherlockFPS idk exactly, but their comp w/ shadowmeld is what enables it
[2:26:38] yonima: prob will get fixed for globals
[2:26:39] nalegi07: they could fix it after MDI
[2:26:41] nekitamocika: They let Dratnos make video about it on WoW main channel
[2:26:42] Krappyboi: it's literally on the warcraft main channel
[2:26:43] GigaforceTV: Well echo asked about it before doing it
[2:26:44] nalegi07: they wont fix it during
[2:26:45] Nox1o: they were 2 minutes faster than last hope in rise
[2:26:45] spivet: the thing about it is if you can't do this kind of tech, literally waht is the point of the portal mobs
[2:26:47] timbo_slice: "working as designed"
[2:26:52] Kamedosin: the mobs are pointless in the actual room
[2:26:54] Whitewolf1441: you think they did it on purpose?
[2:26:57] karbonMAYne: @Maximum doees Mandatory need percent here?
[2:26:58] CiTRiNiTE: Dratnos's video was from wow officials channel. So I dont think they care
[2:27:06] M4ndak: @Maximum Dratnot did video on WoW official channel about that so they are probly ok with it
[2:27:12] M4ndak: Dratnos*
[2:27:17] PrimeTimeRime: @max “task failed successfully”
[2:27:24] GigaforceTV: Meeres said they asked for permission to do it before doing it, like the brackenhide thing they did (which I forget)
[2:27:27] Zarroe: xdding
[2:27:29] Scoops__: mega bs
[2:27:35] FrilleJr: skill issue
[2:27:37] rezalis_: The first one looks like an ffxiv aoe KEKW
[2:27:44] Luminosity6: happened to me a few times
[2:27:46] Mehdehh: Hopeful said they had both echo's tech but they changed how it worked the day of cup A so couldnt do it anymore, and their back up route they did against echo is only about 15sec slower because echo route is much slower in sand area @maximum
[2:27:48] Themselves: doesn't have to happen consistently to send you to loser's bracket xdd
[2:27:55] Regroot_Gaming: mandatory is way ahead
[2:28:05] xkillergod: just tuned in did mandatory do the echo portal strat
[2:28:07] krova: "imagine how sick the MDI would be if they locked all the players in isolated cells after their cup so they cant steal strats from other teams" -lepan
[2:28:11] ryuje_: @maximum the time trials route in here that we knew of atleast involved rezoning and it might have just been faster then this whole portal strat but then that isnt allowed in a cup
[2:28:15] equinox_flare: @xkillergod YES
[2:28:17] EdBoy_: @Regroot_Gaming nah
[2:28:21] Nox1o: q: is it unfair to other teams that each season has completely new dungeons with lost of new tech that Echo will figure out?
[2:28:21] equinox_flare: oops caps
[2:28:22] Tomq0: its crazy to even do this dungeon in group B without the tech
[2:28:23] not_Hivee: @xkillergod yup
[2:28:27] wraghelm: ok so mandatory is windmill dunking on sloth
[2:28:30] Nox1o: xdd
[2:28:31] gulliblelion: w
[2:28:49] vente97: have we had a dungeon reset this mdi? Like when the wall doesn't come down in fall?

[2:29:10] B3AR1TAS: well... their name is sloth lol
[2:29:16] Itskrugs: not called Sloth for nothing
[2:29:19] carlDH_: I just turn on subway surfers when I run the maze and I blaze that shit
[2:29:20] Drenwow: whats the most cooked pro strat that came out of mdi?
[2:29:26] nerefwow: Pog
[2:29:27] Finnomenon: WideTHD

[2:29:35] duplexity_dave: WideDHT

[2:30:11] Themselves: @LuiBMHunter no never
[2:30:39] Themselves: mods can we have a gamba

[2:31:00] scottyjet: maximumGary
[2:31:14] Sathyron: @LuiBMHunter yes, Perplexed has
[2:31:14] PrimeTimeRime: madge
[2:31:25] Nox1o: @LuiBMHunter not compltely crazy new tech. some come up with great routes and pulls but stuff like Brackenhide totems or riftmage almost always comes from echo
[2:31:27] scottyjet: maximumOhno
[2:31:49] vente97: prob too many player over 30
[2:31:58] rauxeta: real life obligations strike hard boys
[2:31:59] Nox1o: @thegrt13 that was already a known spot, they just made the pull huge iirc
[2:32:03] rauxeta: most of them have now jobs
[2:32:13] rauxeta: and cant play 12-14hrs a day

[2:33:03] Nox1o: @rauxeta doesnt the biggest twitch streamer speak spanish?
[2:33:13] rauxeta: @Nox1o I said spanish WOW community
[2:33:22] rauxeta: wow in spanish community is very very niche
[2:33:26] dankotamemes: Spriest is def easier than it used to be but its not exactly what I'd call an easy spec to pick up IG
[2:33:32] Scriix: destro with sanguien is pewp
[2:33:32] Nox1o: wow is very niche in every community
[2:33:35] Nox1o: its a niche game
[2:33:40] rauxeta: nothing compared to american or european communities
[2:33:40] OldManBel: Depends on the tank. Big pulls big numbers for destro. And no sanguine. We stun shit in sanguine and people get upset...

[2:34:54] rauxeta: @Nox1o not impossible, but less likely
[2:34:56] ruediruempel: dh has to much control
[2:34:58] rauxeta: it is the only way to go
[2:35:01] rauxeta: if they want to do it yes
[2:35:19] Nox1o: KEKW

[2:35:31] willlliam_johansssson: double sigils feels so good tho D:
[2:35:37] cerberar: fire mage with flame patch was also ground based
[2:35:38] iiconiicz: Whats the purpose of mage being 3rd dps? Cant they just use a higher dps class and bring drumbs or int buff to op?
[2:35:55] sooziecuzie: Legion Aff was a blast

[3:05:19] Boreall: Rookuri has huge eyes
[3:05:26] B3AR1TAS: if they dont want it done, it shouldnt be able to do... like WTF
[3:05:27] Fishbulb07: They should actually be removed from the whole tournament for that, maybe even death penalty? something to think about
[3:05:27] hxzcc: admins egoing hard ICANT
[3:05:28] kaverrr: That's like they weren't allowed to pull the mobs through the door in temple
[3:05:32] wraghelm: Lol sloth didn’t even finish the dungeon. they wiped and gave up
[3:05:33] Maitel: @Coriollis Meeres said echo asked for approval for that

[3:05:39] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: i hate tettles..perfect hairline mf 😞
[3:05:46] SirPikajew: Pulling mobs from ahead of the boss? Like.. every team did on third boss of shadowmoon?
[3:05:46] Tripl3dot: Imagine losing to an Admin
[3:05:59] PurpleKami: If it's against the rules it's against the rules, admins aren't going to regulate based on the state of the match
[3:06:02] surpriseparty20: Mand took one for the team

[3:07:02] Derp2112: just tuned in, what happend lol?
[3:07:02] theskot: everyone runs tons of adtal tho
[3:07:03] zenkodac: they cant fix it thats why theres a rule against it
[3:07:05] aithran: still waiting for the clip
[3:07:08] zlncy: propoganda time: it's a strat from blizz to farm more stream time
[3:07:23] B3AR1TAS: lol
[3:07:28] bccarroll5: great more adds
[3:07:29] HaiIForsaken: @not_architac they pulled a trash through fence for first boss supposedly and that’s not approved I don’t hink
[3:07:30] Cower311: @mr_skiddy_pants you’re down bad I’m so sorry
[3:07:32] B3AR1TAS: conspiracy, i like it
[3:07:34] krypsus92: krypsus92 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:07:42] jpdundee: I was afk a minute…what is going on?
[3:07:48] not_Hivee: @HaiIForsaken Hasn't that been done for every DHT so far?
[3:07:55] wraghelm: they were in combat b4
[3:07:57] Bebar_Knight: From French Stream, Even Mandatory don't know what they've done wrong
[3:07:59] kaverrr: I think after Temple they probably made a hard rule that you cannot pull through walls on bosses
[3:08:00] holymommades: so I guess I missed something cool
[3:08:02] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: @cower311 im telling my mum
[3:08:15] Basic_3: It's whatever, as long as they're consistent.
[3:08:19] Coriollis: Blizz farming content LUL
[3:08:20] onewing_dragon: My group B table on the website says mandatory won 2/0!???
[3:08:23] chipsychips: I had Adds, what did they do?
[3:08:24] nanerpus_: what did I miss?
[3:08:24] pnguinwow: wait chat i left what happened
[3:08:26] CLINTdotGG: all these extra rules just make the mdi less fun imo :/
[3:08:29] the_great_simonator: @jpdundee mandatory got their game 2 disqualified cuz they used an ilegal strat
[3:08:30] banditkeiith: gingi saying in main stream chat that theyve had strats disapproved for stuff like that before
[3:08:31] powerradezero: Cli pls
[3:08:32] Exikos: is 1 of the teams cornered? they need to pull some crazy route?
[3:08:33] Nipe____: wonder why pulling totem pack through wall on volkaal is okay then
[3:08:41] TonyCookGaming: @onewing_dragon They were fasted on map 2 but were DQd for pulling through the wall
[3:08:42] Rorsbc: good jb take
[3:08:43] Basic_3: In the past they used to tell you not to do stuff if you asked, but if you did it without asking they'd just shrug.
[3:08:43] onewing_dragon: nvm it updated XD
[3:08:43] thatsmybis: Even in temple of sethrallis people pulled the mob at snake boss
[3:08:44] Boreall: @onewing_dragon Their map 2 was DQ'd
[3:08:47] hxzcc: WideTHD dht
[3:08:50] kaverrr: But if all teams can do it then it shouldn't be a problem
[3:08:51] Firenze32: @Nipe____ because its not beyond progression
[3:08:51] Itskrugs: thats just the boss area though
[3:08:53] powerradezero: Clip please
[3:08:55] stigmatiic: they allowed pulling a boss through a wall in tol dagor tho
[3:08:55] shunsha: it’s a quick fix for blizzard…. put the wall up and keep it up until 1st boss is dead. that’s it.
[3:08:57] zenkodac: jb is 100% right, it would just be a cluster fuck of semantics and competitors would complain non stop
[3:08:59] SeanBad_: i seriously dont get it, doesnt this logic applie to the time mender shit echo did? whats the diff? neither should be banned
[3:09:03] HaiIForsaken: @not_architac they were saying that others pulled the boss after, ngl I don’t understand how the rules are cut off
[3:09:09] Sathyron: @Nipe____ because they engage that pack BEFORE the boss and it just runs in
[3:09:14] AsilemxD: Dorki's trust me bro
[3:09:17] greenmachine11235: They should just keep trash from spawning before you're allowed to pull it. Anything that's targetable should be fair game
[3:09:20] fallb4me: so if u tag before pulling is it fine?
[3:09:21] Derp2112: @SeanBad_ exactly lol
[3:09:24] dabidabidabi: the dracthyr would pull the spinny guys in algethar academy while fighting the tree room
[3:09:24] onewing_dragon: Oh, RIP
[3:09:30] Boreall: If EVERYBODY had to ask permission to do it, Blizzard should have fixed the problem to begin with
[3:09:30] Nipe____: @Sathyron valid point
[3:09:31] kaverrr: Raider io still haven't updated the bracket :P
[3:09:33] VIEGAS_PT: lol

[3:09:43] theDirtyon3: trap card Pog
[3:09:43] Kurtisthelol: @Maximum is it more of a after the wall is up and the mage or lock ported back to the boss area after the fight started
[3:09:44] zorkdaddy: Check the PIN on the broadcast
[3:09:47] zenkodac: thats what every team should do
[3:09:51] Exikos: is 1 of the teams cornered? they need to pull some crazy route?
[3:09:52] fredwar: dorki surv main
[3:09:52] beefy_cheez: 5Head Dorki
[3:09:54] zorlonfc: what happened? :D
[3:09:57] magemaster225: you think naowh asked about the cooked rise strat
[3:10:11] turboo_ollie: had they played any map other than fall, ad, and brh so far?
[3:10:12] Sathyron: @SeanBad_ its because you cant "leave" the bossroom that is locked WHILE playing the boss. thats the rule. And that does not apply to the rise-snap
[3:10:13] needaccounttwitch: blizz just make up rules as they go along
[3:10:13] beefy_cheez: @magemaster225 100%
[3:10:14] Maitel: @magemaster225 yeah
[3:10:18] AsilemxD: Sloth with the come back
[3:10:21] MBG_95: you can see the pack coming at 2minutes into the run if you went back
[3:10:23] mozpaladin: @needaccounttwitch fr
[3:10:24] timbeeRR: @magemaster225 most def
[3:10:25] dubiusdingus: how is this not allowed but the teleports in rise are?
[3:10:25] zlncy: @magemaster225 yo fr, how are portals legal, but something like that on DHT isn't
[3:10:29] Vodkaamix: @magemaster225 100%
[3:10:39] Bulgogiprince: my guess is he is right. They asked and were told no and then Mandatory did it without asking
[3:10:43] ZUNKEN: HUH
[3:10:48] wobble_tv: wait what happened
[3:10:48] silentifys: PepeLaugh
[3:10:49] AliciaXuxuu: yeah fuck anal
[3:10:49] Dazzie20: we pulled through walls in mists in SL
[3:10:49] Muercielago: whut
[3:10:51] Cower311: what’s longer… time  between these games or one last epoch loading screen
[3:10:53] ZUNKEN: HUH be what
[3:10:54] Sathyron: @zlncy the rule is dumb, but: its because you cant "leave" the bossroom that is locked WHILE playing the boss. thats the rule. And that does not apply to the rise-snap
[3:10:55] thatsmybis: Cant pull a mob through a wall but can snap a mob half way across a dungeon monkaHmm

[3:11:06] Boreall: true
[3:11:09] Gobbomb: Portals are legal because the mob that's spawns the portals is pullable pre bosses
[3:11:11] shunsha: how funny and also sad would it be if Sloth afk’d at the start and let mandatory win AD? just a big middle finger to the admins
[3:11:12] VIEGAS_PT: @fredwar Concern
[3:11:28] Tsinis: gotta find the  " cheater shit "
[3:11:29] just_ie: Double priest?!
[3:11:30] Fragplux: I like this is the raw podcast, whereas the casters on Warcraft channel is thinking what is being said in here, but cannot, because they are on main channel
[3:11:34] Gobbomb: This is due to them pulling a pack that what normally not be accessible till after the boss
[3:11:35] sooziecuzie: JB is hundy p right. Cheater shit is absolutely the most interesting part of every tournament.
[3:12:01] hxzcc: wtf is going on

[3:16:56] fallb4me: why is Mandatory running double priest instead of druid
[3:16:59] Clevelandmk: what was the exploit on mandatory on DHT?
[3:17:15] Hoiver_: @fallb4me comfort/2nd pi/2nd md for bursting
[3:17:30] shiratto: what happened lol i thought it was 2-0
[3:17:44] ShikaDub: Sloth has to super pull to catch up
[3:17:45] Hoiver_: @shiratto mandatory got dq'd
[3:17:50] ahux_: @shiratto Mandatory cheated
[3:17:58] nekitamocika: mandatory lost map cause admins have small pp KEKW
[3:17:58] Craftthu: @shiratto Mandatory DQd
[3:18:00] shiratto: what did they do do we know
[3:18:05] ShikaDub: Wait how did they get Dq'd
[3:18:15] ShikaDub: Oh ok
[3:18:19] PromiscuousToilet: the offical wow chat literally deletes/times out everything. Idk why i bother KEKW
[3:18:20] needaccounttwitch: dont they pull stuff through the wall on this boss they on now?
[3:18:28] Zerbzz_: whats a dq
[3:18:29] EppatTV: if it was Echo they wouldn't have them disqualified lol
[3:18:31] DeviantHS: would be unfair, if dorkis team wasnt allowed but they are
[3:18:34] not_Hivee: Admin has a favorite child is why
[3:18:40] nekitamocika: DQ = disqualified
[3:18:44] grozzarr: dairy queen
[3:18:47] TJKlaenn: Chat Classic
[3:18:47] emorej69: @Zerbzz_ dairy queen blizzard
[3:18:51] JeeyoIAm: Moad is by far the best dp
[3:18:53] TSmarine: @EppatTV tru
[3:18:54] VenoFrog: @needaccounttwitch it was due to pulling mobs beyond current progression
[3:19:04] jhopps12: mandatory got dairy queen? Pog
[3:19:07] ShikaDub: I know  it's said alot but as long as Mandatory doesn't wipe it's gg
[3:19:09] wraghelm: sloth threw so hard
[3:19:09] theskot: everyone loves it
[3:19:17] not_Hivee: Even if Mandatory didn't do whatever wrong they did they were still ahead by a solid minute or two
[3:19:24] needaccounttwitch: @VenoFrog ok thx
[3:19:49] TeamLiquid: Interested in purchasing a Mythic Amirdrassil, the Dreams Hope boost with Team Liquid? Head over to go.adv.gg/4XuCPI for pricing and to schedule a run! (Gold Only)
[3:19:58] AliciaXuxuu: maybe they just playing safe?
[3:20:07] Piki9: maybe potential if the initial pull was clean?
[3:20:16] Piki9: even if overcooked a bit
[3:20:17] kerp407: LOL DQ cus through the wall
[3:20:20] xkillergod: @Maximum how is pulling trash to this wall for yazma differnet than what they did in dht ?
[3:20:24] kerp407: inb4 DQ number 2
[3:20:29] FlashSib: pack they skip
[3:20:29] TJKlaenn: Through the wall YEP
[3:20:35] nephuhlim: sloth mage is actually doing z perma
[3:20:39] jpdundee: if you consider the bad snap at the start…mandatorys key can best fast if everything works out
[3:20:40] gonzi86: are they getting dq'd again?!
[3:20:46] kerp407: DQ again!!
[3:20:52] Frekzzable: They basicly had a semi wipe and will do a 10min run right?
[3:20:58] ToxicLG: with 2 deaths and no late snap on rezan the mandatory time is pretty insane
[3:21:03] B3AR1TAS: trash in here can be done in any order, but in DHT they pulled from ahead of boss - that is what im guessing.
[3:21:15] Keecheeh: Why did they get Dq'd ?
[3:21:18] TJKlaenn: Sloth gate KEKW
[3:21:18] Lindorn_: gate KEKW
[3:21:18] pepelepu0505: lol
[3:21:19] Zarroe: wtf is that gate
[3:21:21] ThebluesBilly: still sub 10
[3:21:25] shunsha: sloth’s gate
[3:21:26] ToxicLG: the rare first round 3-0
[3:21:31] Slaytime101: 9:18
[3:21:33] Boreall: Wonder what Mandatory gets DQd for on this map
[3:21:41] maulinx: weird how their snapping solution is exactly as cringe as their private aura solution, stop doing dumb shit blizz
[3:21:41] rymistwitch: Kush venge dh inc
[3:21:46] ShikaDub: Womped
[3:21:48] nekitamocika: Sloth looks really shit
[3:21:49] Naribz: 3-0 kek
[3:21:50] grozzarr: orea blizzard
[3:21:56] syst3mctl: @ToxicLG LUL
[3:21:57] holla____: garf gard frag
[3:22:02] aurross: imagine winning 2 1 after winning 3 maps
[3:22:06] piloupslive: What wil blizzard find to dq mdr this time ?
[3:22:07] mrozonmrozon: kush baldnes incoming gard
[3:22:11] Pillzaren: bla
[3:22:19] zlncy: @Boreall not dying as much
[3:22:20] Dorittolol: remove snapping just make the mobs run through the entire dungeon
[3:22:22] evanjelisdh: 3-0 first day
[3:22:23] evanjelisdh: sadge
[3:22:46] GeniusPanda: rayycDab
[3:22:51] grozzarr: dq blizzard yum
[3:22:58] Lenzoface: WHAT HAPPENED PREV MAP, WAS BRB
[3:22:59] otaser: @xkillergod Not sure what exactly they did in DHT, but the entire difference is that they didnt ask for permission in DHT. Teams ask about literally everything to be safe, and Blizzard already told Last Hope no on a strat that Mandatory then did without asking
[3:23:01] Lenzoface: soz caps
[3:23:11] Thamarian: Just do the 4 pull AD like last weekend
[3:23:18] bjoerntorb: wait did mandatory dq on dht?
[3:23:27] syst3mctl: @Lenzoface mandatory pulled adds through wall on first boss of DHT, didn't pre-approve with blizz, they DQed the match
[3:23:30] gulcracko: ball don’t lie
[3:23:43] bjoerntorb: @syst3mctl rip
[3:23:55] SeargentFish: If they sigil of flame right before the boss arena closes do they get DQed? If they place a hunter explo trap and the dryad pats into it? What is the logic here?
[3:24:05] Coriollis: its not ok to pull through wall but is ok to pull from sides of instance that are not evan on the same map, blizz logic 2024 ok
[3:24:06] 60iqtwitchemployee: that was a clean 3-0
[3:24:20] nephuhlim: sloth mage did tank dam NAUUUUUR
[3:24:39] zlncy: @Coriollis Blizzard: >Gigachad face<
[3:24:41] lucid_wow: moad is a priest/pal main but i cant imagine he wouldnt have rdru practiced going into the tourney
[3:24:59] spiritcheese: NOTED just Pull Adds on boss wich can snap
[3:24:59] MBG_95: Xesevi did 124k dps, overall dps was .1mil more
[3:25:10] OldManBel: Moad probably cracked it over the weird DQ and went fuck it playing priest
[3:25:27] gulliblelion: BALDING BATTALION RISE UP
[3:25:30] Groodf: moad also dead for abit
[3:25:35] hxzcc: LETSGO bald bandits

[3:25:36] Teliximus: 3 more series today? @Maximum
[3:25:43] zlncy: 2 PIs gives more funnel value during burst phases i guess
[3:25:45] dabidabidabi: disc is more fun maybe thats why

[3:26:33] OldManBel: Yeah it is
[3:26:36] O_Henriques: who is mark
[3:26:50] OldManBel: Not just a damage point but a damage taken and healing point
[3:26:53] SeargentFish: Why is pi better when funneling? Its just a % increase like motw
[3:26:57] n3ther32: @frostysjazz 3% more damage and 1.5% less damage taken
[3:26:57] TJKlaenn: I was 2/2 for this so

[3:28:09] B3AR1TAS: @xrea12345 they were DQ'd from DHT because they pulled adds thru wall of 1st boss
[3:28:12] zerossussy: wtf
[3:28:13] TJKlaenn: Damn, rip my streak
[3:28:30] GuapSama: a jackal

[3:28:40] guynormally: there was sanguine on this last week, probably sanguine

[3:28:43] Kamedosin: to throw you guys off for this
[3:28:43] spampurge: this shits so cooked
[3:28:44] xrea12345: How did they pull thru wall @b3ar1tas ? Is there any clip of their move?
[3:28:46] 60iqtwitchemployee: @xrea12345 they won 3-0 :)
[3:28:47] zerossussy: @gulliblelion !
[3:28:47] ThebluesBilly: sanguine kitting?
[3:28:51] sv3nds3n: Probably when it was sanguine
[3:28:52] Swiggsi: sanguine?
[3:28:54] SeargentFish: The first crushing grip happens at 0:28, that movement occurred far too early
[3:28:57] ruediruempel: this is accually a ogood addision between the matches
[3:28:59] dg1183: Sanguine kiting for sure
[3:29:00] otaser: pulling the tree that got pulled into it maybe?
[3:29:02] empasempa: he's picking up adds that spawn
[3:29:04] Fishbulb07: they used my movement logs (i'm not good)
[3:29:04] EZ_Mke: Maybe the mage pulled a pack from that side?
[3:29:17] fragileplasma: it was sanguine, also mobs came in during the pull
[3:29:26] dabrink55: tettles change his hair again?
[3:29:26] nayrcraig: Ok, tettles overcooked the hair on this one
[3:29:28] caveman2x: Tettles hair GIGACHAD
[3:29:29] foxyllama: they need some hair on their chest
[3:29:32] illisteve: glazing holy
[3:29:33] VIEGAS_PT: whats wrong with his hair?
[3:29:37] Archerone: Rook is good
[3:29:44] Clush___: xyro looking THICC
[3:29:46] I_H4WX_I: drat looks so proud of himself 🤣

[3:29:58] zerossussy: they should make a map for us to guess on team got disqualified on a certain boss OMEGALUL
[3:30:00] clickermekk: Dratnos face shows how proud he is he got it right
[3:30:08] Tsinis: did they inform all the competitors that  it was not allowed ?
[3:30:14] sabiklol: ask for forgiveness not for permission
[3:30:31] nayrcraig: So Dorki DQ'd them? Got it
[3:30:33] Basic_3: @sabiklol They got a map loss for this strat :P
[3:30:37] kaverrr: So Dorki is the problem?
[3:30:39] duckdaring: They could fix the issue, but the time spent might mean a half a penny less in the pockets of their 84k stockholders.
[3:30:41] Wobblit: Yeah, i'd expect some official list of disallowed tech
[3:30:42] Rahvin331: Better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission
[3:30:54] PhungusTV: the mandatory stans are surely taking this decision well
[3:30:57] lolwhateverdog: just got here what happened lol
[3:31:10] kaverrr: 1 out of 16 teams is American and they still manage to ruin it for everyone
[3:31:12] 60iqtwitchemployee: @duckdaring Maybe my grandkids will tell me about the Rezan bugfix that it stops resetting FeelsStrongMan

[3:32:36] menzlo: Maiden lmao
[3:32:43] shoota1982: they pulled dryad through wall on first boss
[3:32:51] shoota1982: after pulling the boss tho
[3:32:57] shoota1982: apparently it was a no no
[3:33:02] tylxrwow: mage could certainly do it
[3:33:04] tylxrwow: with alter
[3:33:06] shoota1982: stupid bullshit admin decision
[3:33:08] Atari_Safari: that was it? @shoota1982

[3:33:22] shoota1982: dorki said it earlier
[3:33:27] sooziecuzie: They literally just talked about this
[3:33:28] Atari_Safari: thanks for the info
[3:33:35] not_Hivee: So you're not allowed to pull something after you've pulled a boss?
[3:33:36] shoota1982: np
[3:33:39] jcoates1991: Is sub 9 minute atal doable?
[3:33:44] not_Hivee: Pull something in to boss*
[3:33:47] vvrau222: can anyone explain what happened?
[3:33:47] shoota1982: seems like it
[3:33:53] SeargentFish: They should have the mage alter in the boss room, walk over there, and pull the pack after boss room closes out of spite
[3:34:03] clickermekk: its crazy how the disqualification of Mandatory is the most entertaining thing about today so far
[3:34:04] shoota1982: read above vvrau

[3:35:17] vente97: like their heads in the sun
[3:35:21] Dinokaze: The DQ is for competitive integrity, if Last Hope was against Mandatory later on DHT and Last Hope didn't pull it because they were told no, but Mandatory was allowed to; everyone would be upset lol
[3:35:25] Fishbulb07: careful naowh
[3:35:26] 60iqtwitchemployee: @xrea12345 they lost this map and proceeded to win anyway

[3:39:45] korimiii: so jay reviewed the everbloom and if echo had no sanguin healing and no death they were like 1-2sec slower to them
[3:40:09] Harderx88: is fragroot fragnance or fragi?

[4:32:44] qt_girl_gamer: sodas acceptance speech was great
[4:32:45] DeviantHS: soda is at nearly 9mil followers (rank 14 overall) so many ppl know of him
[4:32:45] hxzcc: didnt asmon win something tho
[4:32:51] Team_Spanky: Please know I am joking about your beard. You look like an actual hocky player with it

[4:33:23] imthabeast: disagree. I think it's fully for the creators.
[4:33:30] AoPsyke: some of the awards aimed at smaller streamers are genuinely nice
[4:33:32] BobDaBilda: Idk, I've never been tempted to watch any award events.
[4:33:35] Dzor12: It's for fans and for streamers to get to see their friends that live far away, especially international streamers
[4:33:37] mycho_: parts of it were pretty scuffed, terrible audio/production
[4:33:37] FawnOfTime: I watched some of it and it was just, yikes
[4:33:42] Rilix: holy macaroni i hit play on last epoch and im actually in
[4:33:43] OG_Kawngi: it gets good viewership
[4:33:46] Boreall: I recognized at most 3 of the winners this year
[4:33:47] fleks27: just a circlejerk of clout lets say it how it is
[4:33:52] fleks27: no need to beat around the bush
[4:33:56] guynormally: ^

[4:34:20] Cel_shady: aren't all award shows a circlejerk of clout though?
[4:34:22] FawnOfTime: also I can't remember who it was but there was an award acceptance speech that was so appallingly egotistical it made me want to vomit
[4:34:24] chimneybob: all awards shows are like that
[4:34:25] imthabeast: now, idk if the creators are into it. I'd agree with you there. but I think it's supposed to be for creators. wethere or not it's suceessful at making it for them is a different question
[4:34:30] Kamehameshaw: SUPER EARTH NEEDS YOU SOLDIER

[4:37:41] Lunamhm: @JansonLives idk but it triggered stream ads >(
[4:37:45] Lorrdzik: what about Elden Ring exp trailer?
[4:37:49] just_ie: What % does he push in p2?
[4:37:52] JohnAllenCasts: what's his early p2 phase %?
[4:38:00] fleks27: 40
[4:38:02] Galarian_Hp: 40%
[4:38:05] Galarian_Hp: ?
[4:38:07] moash_: 40.5%
[4:38:12] zen0vae: just came back to retail from SoD... feels good to be home
[4:38:13] callmegort: nerf doesn't matter to noobs like me stuck on smolderon
[4:38:26] nalegi07: TIndral will be the poster child for a boss designed for RWF that is super hard to work back towards late CE guilds
[4:38:36] Zarroe: @zen0vae welcome back to the real world xdd
[4:38:37] thatboyjem: Had a 13% wipe this week, he dies on reset
[4:38:39] xkillergod: whats % of p1 ending
[4:38:59] JohnAllenCasts: we're progging in p3 14% best pull. early phase would suck for 2 min classes on the sheild. Although this nerf does reduce the sheild as well
[4:39:04] fleks27: i like bosses like tindral but only if they actually adjust them within 2-3 weeks
[4:39:05] alarkin: Which is exactly why they should not design bosses that way, ever
[4:39:07] Galarian_Hp: if his hp gets nerfed, are the shield now lower aswell?

[4:39:24] Darkevietv: My Guild has just gotten To Tindral on Wednesday
[4:39:24] Hugosuave: fyrakk still fucks
[4:39:27] ZACKandATTACK: p1 is really hard since there are 3 mechanics happening at the same time that will wipe you. Plus you have to dodge the 1 shot beams
[4:39:28] ASmart_Alex: It's like anduin right - personal responsibility checks hit civilians different
[4:39:29] zen0vae: mythic isnt for everyone :P
[4:39:33] deathbunnyz_: as someone who hit 300 pulls last night, it's still very hard for later CE guilds @Maximum
[4:40:03] JohnAllenCasts: The nerf hits the sheild as well right? it's a % health sheild
[4:40:18] xkillergod: best example for that is Lei shen ?
[4:40:23] highcard2: i think tindral was the great rwf boss ever to watch, it was extremely difficult but watching it you knew what went wrong on a wipe
[4:40:26] fleks27: the race with a easier tindral/fyrakk would have been very boring (again)
[4:40:26] Psyquest: Blizzard messed up the difficulty. The factual end result are 1: guilds folded and people quit, 2: guilds got out of the Fyrakk jail and quit until next xpac. This is happening on french servers.
[4:40:32] thegrt13: I want more bosses to be numbers bosses instead of mechanical instant wipe difficulty
[4:40:34] procotwitch: make it scale based on the groups average RIO easy
[4:40:35] zen0vae: oh it would be awful if it was easy
[4:40:39] fleks27: tindral/fyrakk big time saved the viewer experience
[4:40:42] Boreall: Does it matter that there are different ways? They always design the race for you and Echo so is it relevant which way they pick to make a boss harder?
[4:40:43] wax357: i agree, there are 4 difficulties, not everybody has to be able to kill mythic bosses
[4:40:45] Goats48: Im sorry but you cant argue that blizzard doesnt tune bosses for RWF
[4:40:47] lastericalive: People would get over it eventually
[4:40:50] Arvakr: the race will be all time high once survival is meta during war within
[4:40:59] alarkin: I think the tryhards would be loud and whiny, and almost all other wow players would be happy

[4:41:01] Dzor12: Listening to this song 1 day early smh @Maximum
[4:41:02] Orenria: Then there is my guild stuck on M larry sadge
[4:41:04] Assmaster2k: HUH
[4:41:05] Hugosuave: its crazy to me that 466 guilds are 9/9 mythic this late into the patch
[4:41:07] thegrt13: nope
[4:41:08] Boreall: You didn't say that
[4:41:09] gandivh: I mean an easy raid is not even fun for the 1200th guilds also? People are raiding mythic for the challenge of it. A nerfed tindral is still a challenge for those guys
[4:41:09] zen0vae: he wasnt listening
[4:41:10] Tex1090: think he's hearing made up sounds
[4:41:10] yonima: chatting
[4:41:12] reymargera: Chatting
[4:41:13] ghost97tt: HUH
[4:41:13] Javiz: what
[4:41:13] JackOfAllApocalypses: nope, that guy said something weird, not you
[4:41:13] moistnip69: LUL
[4:41:15] zen0vae: mans is lost
[4:41:15] Kamehameshaw: That mans comprehension is in the negatives
[4:41:20] gyser13: They need more adjustments faster not 3 months later.
[4:41:22] Vis4vengeance: Literally just said the opposite
[4:41:26] Zaisx: bro is living in his own world
[4:41:27] Psyquest: Of course blizzard tune bosses to have an exciting race
[4:41:29] Holyjudgee: lol
[4:41:29] Kinvaras23: we are 250 pulls into mythic smolderon and I’m worried it’s gonna kill my guild any day now
[4:41:32] JPsyches: I dont understand the argument around mythic balancing.
[4:41:33] Jazzarus_: well, the race would be over in a day if not, dont know how that actually impacts the game tho
[4:41:33] Rikachizzle: that dude didnt pay attention in school and cant form coherent arguements
[4:41:45] lastericalive: they just need to swing the nerf hammer much harder after hall of fame is done
[4:41:49] Team_Spanky: I got problems here. I just face fucked three cheeseburgers and onion rings... I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.
[4:41:50] FawnOfTime: @Goats48 Chatting
[4:41:53] Arvakr: do u agree that council and ignira are awful bosses to recler
[4:41:55] CallMeTOG: Maybe he wad responding to someone else in chat but didn't tag them
[4:41:58] azm07: last 2 bosses prenerf is beyond insanity
[4:42:04] gonzi86: Tuning doesn't matter that much, it is fine, the lockout is the problem
[4:42:09] gyser13: Tindy was not a thank fuck we did it became a thank fuck its over.
[4:42:13] TehWongWay: was smolderon close to sludgefist in tuning for you guys? @Maximum
[4:42:14] Jazzarus_: @Team_Spanky that sounds good, I wish I could have a burger rn
[4:42:15] RenegadeHeals: seems perfectly reasonable to me that the last 3-4 bosses should basically be mythic++ and get nerfed after the race asap
[4:42:15] Zaisx: @Team_Spanky HUH
[4:42:21] konflic12: my guild is hard stuck on smoldy
[4:42:31] Cazacon109: what did they do for halondrus? swear they removed personal responsibility alot there
[4:42:36] Kinvaras23: same Konflic
[4:42:41] fleks27: @TehWongWay hard to compare since prep has evolved since CN tbh
[4:42:45] Galarian_Hp: my issue with high pullcount bosses is the bench, sitting people for weeks
[4:42:48] Kinvaras23: smolderon is ass fucking us 6 hours a week
[4:42:50] NoLimitsNick: That was mythic ToS in Legion.
[4:42:54] nick08_wow: thayts ALL mechanics on tindral LMAO
[4:42:54] zen0vae: remember ghu'un lol
[4:42:57] KillUAssie: JB’s take
[4:43:00] Amithilis: This was a JB cook
[4:43:04] JPsyches: why does it matter if mythic raiding is balanced for the top end
[4:43:10] Darkevietv: Alot of Guilds has Waved the White flag and Disbanded over Tindral
[4:43:12] Goats48: there is a stream delay I see how my msg wasnt received correctly
[4:43:15] Dzor12: When I fly up for flare bombs and a tank misses a Mushroom and wipes us I die inside a little bit @Maximum
[4:43:18] zen0vae: G'huun*
[4:43:31] tanikins: make the punishment -80% damage. I AM DONE HEALING GREEDY IDIOTS
[4:43:47] JakeParkbench: What about some damage downs even for fucking up
[4:43:50] gyser13: Why is it happening 3 months later tho it should have been far sooner
[4:43:52] Jazzarus_: eternal palace has the best scenery out of any raid, fight me
[4:43:57] Arvakr: heaing astral break is enough to wipe me at this point
[4:44:16] gyser13: @Jazzarus_ agreed
[4:44:33] nealeyy87: would it be easier to 5 heal Tindral now?
[4:44:38] lithobraking: @tanikins seconded
[4:44:40] moash_: Nuke the person that messed up so you wont make the dps check
[4:44:44] panta_xdd: Having wipeing mechanics on random people is very bad for lower ce guilds, if  someone in your guild need to see it like 10 times to get it you can easily be taking 200 trys so that everyone sees that single mechanic
[4:44:49] Abestheman: Max, you should narrate some books.
[4:45:04] Kinvaras23: @maximum wanna help my guild kill Smolderon on Tuesday for stream content 🤡
[4:45:05] alarkin: I actually think a raid where the hardest boss is about the Smolderon level would be extremely well received by the vast vast majority of players - but complainers are very loud and annoying. This read has perfectly illuminated that the difficulty curve is just wildly out of sync and something needs to change.
[4:45:09] fdb33: @Dzor12 this is so relatable holy fuck
[4:45:10] nenkaz: Big hugs from Norway Max! 🫶🏻
[4:45:10] auby6: stop making bosses for just 2 guilds only
[4:45:13] Diinklebeeerg: 10 man mythic when?? @Maximum
[4:45:19] CallMeTOG: @jazzarus_ gotta disagree, talking just scenery, nyalotha clears
[4:45:23] Vramii: its extra hard for 2 day guiilds - we are hard stuck on Tindral rigfht now just getting to 3rd platform but like it feels like it will never end
[4:45:27] Uhblivean24: but I mean isn’t skill level what’s being tested in mythic @maximum
[4:45:28] thenateo2: no shot OMEGALUL
[4:45:39] TehWongWay: if the last boss was Tindral, i would be fine with it
[4:45:41] Jazzarus_: @CallMeTOG that is for sure a competitor for the top spot
[4:45:43] fleks27: nuking the entire rwf would def be not liked but some
[4:45:48] DodogZ: Hard disagree
[4:45:49] MeisterChiefX: that was just aberrus
[4:45:55] Faraday5001: smolderon is way too easy of a boss to cap mythic at
[4:46:08] FicWader: @Maximum they could probably stop gear progression on HC level and make mythic only about mounts achievements and maybe mtx
[4:46:11] thegrt13: I think sark was rewarding
[4:46:13] gyser13: I clear mythic once and then unsub since i consider it beating the game
[4:46:15] auby6: race should be about strat and speed, so do global release and stop making bosses for 2 guilds
[4:46:17] thegrt13: and that was harder than smolder
[4:46:20] gyser13: i would have just stopped 3 weeks sooner then
[4:46:21] bjoerntorb: ngl if they made new raids too easy for the race their would be so much backlash
[4:46:23] Ditysalad: nobody wants to have 600+ pulls on a boss
[4:46:24] wax357: same goes for the legendary I think. look back to classic, one, maybe two people out of a guild got thunderfury. somehow these days everybody thinks he has to get the legendary axe, I don't understand why
[4:46:28] nyshindysheen: probs but, smoldy is my fav NGL
[4:46:30] Elioss: That was Emerald Nightmare
[4:46:32] tykus21: wasnt vault pretty good??
[4:46:36] Elioss: People hated it
[4:46:40] fdb33: idk isnt the point of Mythic that not everyone can easily do it, its supposed to be challenging and not necessarily surmountable for everyone
[4:46:47] Mharad: i just think raid have too many bosses
[4:46:48] deathbunnyz_: If CE became only slightly harder than AOTC the reason a lot of people do it would be gone no?
[4:46:54] panta_xdd: I liked Sarkareth difficulty
[4:46:54] Azurtri: I raid to get CE right around the end of the tier. I like hard bosses. I’m actually really enjoying Tindral. If I wanted it to be easy I’d run heroic.
[4:46:56] JohnAllenCasts: My guild is 14% best pull on tindral and everyone seems split as to if we are happy about nerf or not on tindral. We're definitely capable of getting the kill as is, but there's a cerain amount of relief after 400+ pulls and rosters changing every week XD
[4:47:01] fleks27: aberuss was very easy compared to usual tiers i mean thats just how it is
[4:47:06] fdb33: Like classic is there if u wanna raid easier stuff and get bis loot, and I love claaic for that
[4:47:06] zen0vae: xavius was so good maN
[4:47:09] CallMeTOG: @jazzarus_ there's actually some far off platforms in nyalotha you can land on if you use gliding mechanics and the mechagon trinket that gives you a parachute, really neat stuff there's like no invisible wall to stop you from going farther out (that I found)
[4:47:16] Exikos: what is your favorite boss?
[4:47:27] gyser13: We should not have Helya level of hard fights ever again tho
[4:47:33] nyshindysheen: my guild is still stuck on mythic igura... nerf everything
[4:47:34] gyser13: that fight ruined me
[4:47:34] antipheonixna: do u think difficulty in between bosses needs to be smoothed out, feel we are due larger raids so ppl spend more time progressing, seems we are stuck in low mid high tier fights rn
[4:47:54] Lorven_: install grafana real quick
[4:47:54] Arvakr: my guild just killed smolderon and we're happy about the nerfs lol
[4:47:55] barrui: wiped at 0.89% last night. thats the split in our guild. we coulda done prenerf
[4:48:00] imsoosleepy: We got a 2% wipe last night and have a final raid on Sunday before the nerf so I hope we kill before the nerf!!
[4:48:01] crazystevelul: Sussy
[4:48:07] ctg_dreamz: that's us, we literally finished the day at 8% on Tindral today and feel like it will be a cake walk next week
[4:48:11] JohnAllenCasts: that's pretty good tbh
[4:48:13] Arvakr: @imsoosleepy GL!
[4:48:22] deathbunnyz_: 31% best pull last night, my guild was kinda hyped
[4:48:29] DayOldBeef: We were close before the tindral multiple seeds soaking nerf. Still felt great
[4:48:32] imsoosleepy: @Arvakr ty
[4:48:35] Elioss: YOur "guild already killed the boss" is really big for some reason lol
[4:48:42] JohnAllenCasts: you are SMOKING if you think the % of people on reclear is that high @Maximum
[4:48:45] tykus21: Why no "My mom category" , shes really happy because i play less... Dont hate on moms..
[4:48:50] procotwitch: fuckem, get better or get worse KEKW
[4:48:55] alarkin: So I think this middle gets lost in the conversation, because the people with platforms who talk all come from the SAME space of players - but 1000s of guilds raid mythic and don't ever clear, what do we reasonably think they would like? They far outnumber the 700 who will kill Fyrakk. Is it not better that Fyrakk has 3000 kills, more engagement, more activity, from being more reasonable as a capstone difficulty challenge? I think the missing voices of the 5-8/9 guilds needs to be found somehow.
[4:48:56] tastygoudatv: Our guild is 200 pulls in 48% best and I'm pretty meh on it
[4:49:00] znokfps: my guild have best try 8% rn feels sadge
[4:49:01] m0rkyyy: The time they put in still got them to a point where they can kill post nerf
[4:49:16] Soupkitchn: Reclear is the sliver in this circle lol
[4:49:18] JohntheBarbarian: no shot
[4:49:19] nyshindysheen: RECLEAR? my guild takes 3days to kill heroic to this day @Maximum
[4:49:20] moash_: 2 hour reclear incoming ty blizz
[4:49:23] Arvakr: No shot man
[4:49:29] thenateo2: like 1k
[4:49:31] TCancelYO: yeah there is no way
[4:49:31] Spinerek: 56
[4:49:32] Korupcija_: 27
[4:49:34] Soupkitchn: there is signifcantly more guilds currently progging Tindral then that had killed him.
[4:49:36] TehWongWay: idk how many of those ~500 guilds with CE are reclearing atm
[4:49:37] Kurtisthelol: like 1k
[4:49:37] Orenria: My guild has 2 raid teams progging M T swift
[4:49:40] thereal_LG: we killed Sark by this point last tier, we have only got it to 14% pre second nerf
[4:49:43] znokfps: just over 1k
[4:49:45] Jjmn12: what is reclearing, everyone is extended for 2 months FeelsWeirdMan
[4:49:46] minikori: go to wowprogress and scroll down
[4:49:46] gyser13: What is the point of reclears if you do not care about ranking etc and just want to beat the game
[4:49:51] TehWongWay: but everyone around this level still progging are extendo
[4:49:57] nyshindysheen: only 1k???
[4:50:03] Arvakr: well how many have killed smolderon
[4:50:03] thenateo2: no
[4:50:04] Dzor12: Yes
[4:50:05] MoleDude: No shot
[4:50:07] Ikillubad: Also keep in mind if you're not doing mythic at all, then none of this applies
[4:50:07] JohntheBarbarian: easily
[4:50:08] Viisionz74: 100%
[4:50:08] Dzor12: Wait
[4:50:10] Kurtisthelol: no
[4:50:11] BuffPaladins: We are
[4:50:11] Kurtisthelol: shot
[4:50:12] Galarian_Hp: so i like doing p2 and like to prog p3, but wiping in p1 is getting old
[4:50:13] JohnAllenCasts: yes, for sure
[4:50:13] DasAutoChat: probarly the other ones gave up Keepo
[4:50:13] wobble_tv: 100% there is
[4:50:14] ddepan: there is ~1900 smolderon kills so yeah
[4:50:15] ThatOhio: check how many have killed smolderon
[4:50:15] chimeraxst: @Maximum so what about the rest of the raid with no nerfs :I  its always just been Fyrakk and tindrel nerfed. Thats more mind blowing
[4:50:16] nealeyy87: Tindral killed so many guilds
[4:50:16] fdb33: how many Smoldy kills
[4:50:19] malnourish_: i have no idea honestly
[4:50:19] Dzor12: Progging on Tindral, no
[4:50:21] guynormally: xddShrug i don't know anything about these stats
[4:50:24] nasberg: yes, my guild is proging tindral
[4:50:25] Holyjudgee: how many have killed smoldy
[4:50:27] tanikins: Welll How many of those 950 are done and even doing reclears
[4:50:30] JohntheBarbarian: they woudlnt still be paying attention to it if there werent a bunch of people stuck on it @Maximum
[4:50:31] malnourish_: yeah check smolderon
[4:50:32] nealeyy87: so many Tindral guilds are just dead now
[4:50:32] MoleDude: WCL surely has this data, but I don't know how to get it.
[4:50:33] deathbunnyz_: yeah but a lot of guilds are not killing it again, just get CE and log off
[4:50:33] fleks27: only 1920 ish guilds killed smolderon
[4:50:35] dburnnzz: thats not the point, you said reclearing tindral vs killing it now
[4:50:35] Regroot_Gaming: so only 19,000 players killed tindral
[4:50:36] nasberg: INfluenza Eu
[4:50:37] Kurtisthelol: people think 950+ guilds are on tindy right now
[4:50:39] fleks27: so its just a math exercise
[4:50:41] Ronangic: check Tindral kills and minus Fyrakk kills?
[4:50:43] zerossussy: i confirm that a few guilds i know stopped after smolderon
[4:50:43] RenegadeHeals: 1900
[4:50:43] KDaily: look at Smold kills and split the difference
[4:50:43] CallMeTOG: No, not progging. MANY have quit including 2 of my guilds
[4:50:51] ChaosPDubz: @Maximum check wcl
[4:50:52] logain_13: My guild is on Fyrakk Heroic...so there's that
[4:50:57] Zarroe: HAH
[4:50:57] boostedh_: KEKW
[4:50:58] aescend_: my guild is 300+ pulls deep with like 10-15 p2 pulls
[4:50:59] Korupcija_: OMEGALUL
[4:51:00] reymargera: KEKW
[4:51:02] Dzor12: Lul
[4:51:03] natethenoob1234: LUL
[4:51:08] Cuore22: You're not thinking about it right. You don't reclear Tindral until you kill Fyrakk.
[4:51:10] Tripl3dot: xdd
[4:51:11] ThatOhio: ThatOhio subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! If you check the recruitment discord, its a sea of "my guild stopped/fell apart on tindral" (currently progging tindral, and recruiting here and there)
[4:51:14] TehWongWay: maybe like 20% of those guilds are progging tindral
[4:51:15] Regroot_Gaming: Look at the kill date ,
[4:51:17] RenegadeHeals: shoutout Highly Regarded
[4:51:18] Regroot_Gaming: very recent
[4:51:19] JohnAllenCasts: so maybe 200 of those guilds are on tindral prog in the sliver you had
[4:51:21] dburnnzz: thats just kills, not reclear
[4:51:25] tanikins: We're on tindral now, only 150 pulls and seen P2 like... 10 times? SO we're pretty stoked.
[4:51:38] Loovrro: A lot are probably pugs doing it for trinkets
[4:51:47] minikori: use wowprogress it's got counts on home page
[4:51:53] itsgamz: Just don't specify by boss and spam next
[4:52:03] Regroot_Gaming: On? those are the kills
[4:52:07] Cuore22: pretty much yeah
[4:52:10] ThatOhio: ~300 pulls for so far for my guild, we saw a couple sub 20% tindrals last night, so we're hoping for tuesday kill
[4:52:13] TCancelYO: yup
[4:52:13] JohntheBarbarian: exactly
[4:52:17] moash_: So many guilds disbanded after prog
[4:52:20] alarkin: So I think this middle gets lost in the conversation because the people with platforms who talk all come from the SAME space of players - but 1000s of guilds raid mythic and don't ever clear, what do we reasonably think they would like? They far outnumber the 1000 who will kill Fyrakk. Is it not better that Fyrakk has 4000 kills, more engagement, more activity, from being more reasonable as a capstone difficulty challenge? I think the missing voices of the 5-8/9 guilds needs to be found somehow.
[4:52:23] Saece: we are best attemp 11% tindrel and t hat puts us at 1072 world
[4:52:25] Whiskeydemon: 100%, not worth reclearing at all
[4:52:26] Zentrex: Zentrex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:52:28] nalegi07: several of those guilds Deadge too
[4:52:29] Suwah84: that’s a vibe
[4:52:45] JohnAllenCasts: so maybe 200 guilds are deep into tindral prog so sit in your sliver and 500 are on reclear @Maximum
[4:52:51] fixii92: when starts group b ?
[4:52:56] highcard2: the majority of guilds that wont clear have been done raiding for a while tho
[4:52:58] HeffaBear: can i get a referral to the guild that stops after last boss
[4:53:02] xodxx: my guild died on Fyrakk 5 weeks ago, STILL getting recruitment DM's, too busy playin SoD now
[4:53:07] auby6: no one is asking for only heroic
[4:53:11] Trodenskjold: @fixii92 its over for today
[4:53:12] KDaily: so it’s 1000 possibly on Tindy, maybe 20% stopped progging?
[4:53:24] moash_: Thats gw2 issue, no challenging content
[4:53:24] JPsyches: What's the argument, whats the point in nerfing mythic raiding just for the sake of more people to do it. There's already 3 other difficulties
[4:53:28] lastericalive: But there could be more people doing it
[4:53:30] itsgamz: Last boss heroic should be harder imo
[4:53:30] cawnch: a bit harder than heroic =/ mythic smoldy tbf
[4:53:31] valshiya: at least 466 of them right now KEKW
[4:53:38] ZACKandATTACK: I wish heroic had the mythic mechanics, but they were just tuned easier.
[4:53:39] Boreall: 95% of the people who don't do Mythic at all don't care that Mythic exists, they're not mad that other players are better
[4:53:40] Regroot_Gaming: @Maximum  have you seen the legendary drop chance buffs ?
[4:53:41] JinNights: at what point do people just understand they arent good enough to kill the bosses?
[4:53:43] Eleemz: Classic is kinda like that isnt it? (even easier i guess but still)
[4:53:46] fdb33: Im with u Max the point of Mythic is to not be accessible to everyone
[4:53:47] MeisterChiefX: smolderon on mythic isnt even close to a heroic boss
[4:53:53] Saece: *** you can see here how many are doing tindrel
[4:53:54] Orenria: Yeah Smoldy M is 10x hard than H fyrakk
[4:53:55] SolomonRed33: should just make it like Lost Ark where the hardest diffuculty is normalized and everyone can access the same item level gear
[4:53:59] gyser13: Do they not have a team watching these stats? Do they pay attention to it?
[4:54:04] azm07: if tindral was last boss of tier it would be acceptable
[4:54:06] KDaily: Smolderon a banger tho
[4:54:07] SolomonRed33: but it drops no loot, only cosmetics and titles
[4:54:10] Korupcija_: *** classic
[4:54:12] JPsyches: @moash_ idk when the last time you played is but this is pretty false
[4:54:13] FicWader: @Maximum do you think arms will ever move away from Juggernaut? because i feel it made sudden death  proc rate almost nonexistent and puts a lot of warr dps into execute phase
[4:54:16] alarkin: I think WoW's playing population is older, and not about to get better at a 20 year old game. Blizzard needs to reckon with this - you can push the curve of difficulty up all that you want, and all that does is render it less accessible to more of the players - I don't understand how that is good.
[4:54:17] Oracle_WoW: 8/9m guilds maybe just need to adjust their expectations
[4:54:25] Detras22: i think tswift and fyrakk have just exposed alot of guilds healers and tanks, cant hide them as well anymore
[4:54:25] huk42: It's a bit bad that the difficulty comes from getting 20 people to do things correctly rather than figuring out the fight. Smaller raids could help a lot the 500+ rank guilds.
[4:54:27] Cuore22: I would probably not be happy is Smolderon was peak difficulty. I don't know if I would quit the game. But they would have to pump out content much faster.
[4:54:33] wax357: what's the liquid MDI team or the team where some liquid members run?
[4:54:37] SolomonRed33: well remove any of that junk then
[4:54:39] Soupkitchn: @Maximum The ideal difficulty is certainly somewhere between tindrall and Smolderon. I think the biggest issue with Tindral is he just isn't very fun to progress because of the frequent raid whipe 1-shots. Prog graphs looking like a seisomograph aren't super fun. haha
[4:54:43] BratBranko: cards are also normalized in hell mode\
[4:54:46] Whiskeydemon: maybe if they would slow down the upgrade train so that gear acquisition actually acted as a soft nerf like it did in the past? As opposed to them being required to come in and do manual nerfs and they're always seen as coming too late because they are
[4:54:46] MeisterChiefX: lost ark moved away from normalized difficulty lmao
[4:55:04] thereal_LG: It has taken us roughly x3 the amount of time to kill Tindral as it did echo of nelth last tier, that feels bad regardless
[4:55:09] sh4ndooo: 10man raids are BIS
[4:55:12] Gingerprimer: @Maximum how many ppl do you think Blizzard want to be Mythic raiding? For them to still think it is "worth" to put dev time into it?
[4:55:20] Saece: Just over 900 guilds on tindrel at the momement
[4:55:23] kinschen: but isnt that magetower? like gear not matter but a hard fight
[4:55:48] fdb33: @alarkin r people limited to only playing the very highest difficulty of the game? I think ur argument is resolved by the presence of H and Mythic +stuff
[4:55:50] Jazzarus_: retail haters can suck it, it's still the best mmo out there

[4:56:07] Ampped87: I wish lost ark had WoW gearing. That game was so fun
[4:56:12] ArctosPrime: ger mattered for og mage tower
[4:56:14] dika93: @Jazzarus_ retail fell off hard sadly
[4:56:27] RandaIFire: they have gone agains thell mode tho
[4:56:31] Lorven_: are you a masondota2 fan?
[4:56:35] RandaIFire: new hell mode is not normalized
[4:56:37] Korentice: i played like 2 hours of LE and there was no server issues
[4:56:42] mrozonmrozon: how is mythic lockout fun ?
[4:56:46] thenateo2: retail is still biggest version of wow by far
[4:56:47] JPsyches: There's already 3 other difficulties they dont need to nerf mythic just so more people can do it. Not everybody will full clear mythic and thats alright
[4:56:53] valshiya: always
[4:57:02] fleks27: do people still not accept that wow is cycling between retail and classic hype peaks
[4:57:04] Orenria: I still playing wow cuz my guild is still progging mythic
[4:57:06] kinschen: true and real
[4:57:06] gyser13: Retail is fantastic for the first 6 weeks or so is fantastic. But its not good 3 months in
[4:57:07] cyapat1: league of legends is a poison
[4:57:08] specialtydish: I'm too old for other games
[4:57:08] cornygerman: gott do them rekills :(
[4:57:08] Oracle_WoW: i blame liquid. you guys need to make your WA's more intuitive for the guilds that follow
[4:57:10] tumbro: r1 M+ though?
[4:57:13] Hugosuave: u gotta spread democracy
[4:57:13] Ionized4: still grinding to maintain title tho
[4:57:14] highcard2: games are just seasonal nowadays, you can't just play one game all day every day
[4:57:15] iCarDog: meant to be a seasonal game
[4:57:16] elliVVille: great game to be a tourist in
[4:57:17] Spritesgud: we just do m+ alt spams
[4:57:17] ogbuckwheats: I feel personally attacked
[4:57:18] auby6: this all stems from the fact that people are of the opinion the game would do better if mythic raid was more accessible to the majority @Maximum
[4:57:22] BigTrout3: jokes on you, I'm only now starting my wow season Clueless
[4:57:23] SquirtleLvl1: im just a masochist xD
[4:57:23] XadrOwO: Retail is the best WoW has ever been
[4:57:26] Kinvaras23: I’ll always have the crack that is league of legends to fall back on at the end of seasons
[4:57:27] BobDaBilda: I am seeing the World... Of Warcraft.
[4:57:28] adrianwinky: @Maximum I'm kinda new in wow, but i read that 489 gear is from mythic 18 to 22 i believe. So 23 forward is done in order to test your skills or does it still benefit gear ilvl rewards somehow?
[4:57:31] specialtydish: I just do casual achievement catchup during downtime
[4:57:33] sethomatic: rock n stone!
[4:57:33] GENERALFISTA: wow is the best game 5 months into a season, u get to carry wow grandma and wow grandpa in mythic pugs
[4:57:37] NYKO7_: thats the problem with wow player base. There are a lot of people that play only wow
[4:57:37] zerossussy: high M+ is fun once u get into it with decent group/friends
[4:57:39] Mharad: It's terrible : i love playing with my guild but raid are too long and im bored halfway through but i still stick to the end most of the time and its' pain
[4:57:40] lorddustdevil: theres still people pushing for title and stuff
[4:57:41] mrozonmrozon: how is mythic lockout fun ?
[4:57:49] diasmo: visit Super Earth and become a citizen
[4:57:55] JPsyches: Classic is a lot easier
[4:57:56] Gingerprimer: @Maximum NGL only thing stopping me from playing more retail atm is the boredoom of having to farm so many crests
[4:57:57] itsmiraix: I still play wow because I am still addicted..
[4:58:00] ASmart_Alex: don draper meme
[4:58:01] alarkin: @fdb33 See but it isn't though, because RE: gear progression they want to chase the best possibilities - so they follow the carrot on a stick only to run into a brick wall - and it's little wonder they stop playing. If you dedicate 9 hours a week to raid with 19 people, you should be given a reasonable chance to see the capstone content. The time you give matters, or at least it should. Again, the missing 1000s of 4-8/9M guilds is just completely absent in this conversation, and that's bad.
[4:58:05] highcard2: classic betrayed me and i will forever hate it
[4:58:11] Boreall: As a Classic Player, they hate retail out of misinformation and no care to correct that
[4:58:14] auby6: classic has no depth to the specs
[4:58:14] ZizzTV: YUP
[4:58:16] GnarstyTV: "We don't even think about you"
[4:58:16] Viisionz74: I play retail as my main game but i play SoD as my side game because i like the nostalgia with a twist
[4:58:18] buzwiteyer: actually very true for the ppl I’ve spoken to
[4:58:22] BobDaBilda: It's the RuneScape thing. RS vs OSRS
[4:58:22] Dberjerak823: As someone in a classic guild, yes they are all very jaded
[4:58:23] Falzyker: Retail players go into classic go chill, but classic Andies don't go into retail to compete
[4:58:24] MuuRetsu: the only thing that i would change on mythic as a player who gets CE and the end of the season is the Mythic Lockout this shit is a old mechanic that adds nothing
[4:58:25] wax357: to be honest im playing this game for almost 20 years and I have never had more fun this late in an expansion than in Dragonflight
[4:58:29] specialtydish: Classic just has little sibling syndrome.
[4:58:31] Jazzarus_: @Boreall 100% they dont really know how the game plays
[4:58:32] mrozonmrozon: how is mythic lockout fun ?
[4:58:37] Harry_barry_larry: it's the don draper meme - "i don't think of you at all"
[4:58:37] Whiskeydemon: They need to slow down the upgrade train even more so that gear acquisition actually acted as a soft nerf like it did in the past as opposed to them being required to come in and do manual nerfs and they're always seen as coming too late because they are. It's never going to be fun for someone who clears at a slower than HoF level to run into pre-nerf Tindral because they haven't nerfed it fast enough and there's no steady strength gained to counteract it or no raidwide (ICC) nerf mech @Maximum
[4:58:39] fleks27: lots of classic players have a super made up retail in their mind and they hate that version even if its entirely false
[4:58:41] Pannitra: that is so true, Classic players really do feel like that
[4:58:44] fleks27: then they go world pvp for 12hrs
[4:58:52] deathbunnyz_: @Maximum there were more keys run this past week than there were 3 weeks into season 2 though, so people tons of people are still enjoying it
[4:58:52] wobble_tv: classic requires soo much less focus, most of the classic players i know are much older than retail players by a large margin in my experience
[4:58:57] Whiskeydemon: @fleks27 true
[4:59:00] anyxd1: asmongold propoganda
[4:59:00] elliVVille: i wonder how many ppl genuinely actively play both games
[4:59:01] Boreall: Classic Players remember retail as "When they quit playing", so they hate Warlord retail and think it never changed
[4:59:03] weaselss: I've had friends that only played classic come to retail and be surprised. They heard only bad things about m+ and loved it to death LOL
[4:59:05] RandyTheRam1: classic players are just some weird elitists chasing the dragon that was the feeling they had when they first played. spoiler -- aint ever gonna be like that again
[4:59:13] Kinvaras23: classic players have Asmongold syndrome
[4:59:13] JazzyMolly: retail has middle child syndrome IMO
[4:59:16] Dberjerak823: They'll state something as an issue for why they dont play retail and it'll be something that hasn't existed since BFA
[4:59:17] DasAutoChat: they just miss the days when they were younger
[4:59:20] DasAutoChat: LUL
[4:59:30] ThreesFG: Classic is like an older uncle who still owns a beeper
[4:59:31] kyydh: @RandyTheRam1 LUL LUL
[4:59:37] bringback6v6_ow: Do u think the game is good for newer players to get into? what’s your perspective on that
[4:59:43] wax357: i don't think the typical classic Andy has much going on in his life LUL
[4:59:45] Jazzarus_: "retail wow needs a reset"
[4:59:45] specialtydish: Man, I'm a retail guy and I still kind of hate group finder.
[4:59:50] zen0vae: classic players are all grandpas
[4:59:51] reymargera: BBoomer game not what it used to be
[4:59:54] sethron: tons of classic players still think retail is too easy because leveling is easier than classic
[5:00:09] dika93: BBoomer LFR killed wow
[5:00:09] HarmonyFart: @wax357 Classic andys are most toxic beings on twitch
[5:00:10] Itz_Crackerz58: i just feel like im to far behind to play retail. classic inst as overwhelming
[5:00:10] tempehst11: pet battles get too much development
[5:00:10] Questly21: which is fine. You don't need to like the game your whole life
[5:00:18] thegrt13: retail is more about the gameplay and the difficulty and the counterplay. classic is about the community/leveling/the story
[5:00:19] Mezzedii: classic isnt harder its just longer
[5:00:21] Fray24_: I still love thinking about the poll that showed more retail players and classic andy's could not believe it lol
[5:00:24] Niksen_99: Nothing is hard in classic. It just takes time
[5:00:24] notlunais: I quit retail after 15 years last summer. I played the new season of classic (SoD) and what I liked alot about it was the 3 day raid reset. I liked being able to clear the raid then do alts or something else and not feel tied to m+ etc. to stay relevant in end game content.
[5:00:28] fdb33: @alarkin I disagree with the first point, since M+ exists to give u the highest level of gear as well from vaults. And as an individual its always possible to improve in this game and work your way to a higher level guild. But its not like your point is invalid
[5:00:30] Tonitoto233: some ppl dont like the game because of dmg,hp numbers :D
[5:00:30] zen0vae: i love classic but it feels super casual and most of the gameplay is running from A to B
[5:00:37] Zyii_: The leveling in classic these days is just sitting in dungeons getting boosted by flying mages
[5:00:39] Mischievous_TV: Delulu andys
[5:00:40] Harderx88: I don't like the game that much anymore and a big part of that is we don't get blind raiding anymore, everyting is premapped and datamined
[5:00:41] fleks27: people in classic just leveled by spam farming SM mostly
[5:00:44] LoupyEU: how do you keep an entire world first raid team interested and not taking long afk's between raids?  or long afks are acceptable?
[5:00:45] BigTrout3: 1 mob. drink. 1 mob. drink. 2 mobs. panic. live. drink
[5:00:48] auby6: classic is harder leveling for the wrong reasons, who wants to oom
[5:00:48] BobDaBilda: Blackrock monkaS
[5:00:52] nat3s: longer, more dangerous, yet more tedious, loved classic for the nostalgia, but retail is demonstrably better mechanically
[5:00:54] Harderx88: I do however love watching the race to world first #LetsGoLiquid
[5:00:56] lord_windir: Even LFR KEKW
[5:00:57] logain_13: Normal raid in retail is significantly harder than classic
[5:00:58] profplur: after palying SoD, it's easier than normal
[5:00:58] guynormally: classic is easier than Normal raids
[5:00:59] Roccocco: running = endgame in classic
[5:01:01] Boreall: Again, as a classic player, heroic is WAY harder than anything classic has ever offered
[5:01:02] fdb33: The point of Classic is chillin in Disc with the homies
[5:01:04] Kidmidnight757: seems like its just a bit different on which aspect of the game provides more challenge betwen retail and classic, which is ok
[5:01:04] Pannitra: Same for 2 of my friends, they raid with people who have a really hard time clearing icecrown citadel, and when we talk retail they tell me i’d fall asleep on half of the icecrown bosses due to low difficulty
[5:01:04] Jazzarus_: gnarlroot in normal is harder than anything in classic
[5:01:08] JazzyMolly: @BigTrout3 yesss
[5:01:09] Jay_Morgs: bro my guild clears gnomer in like 45 minutes
[5:01:12] fdb33: And its great for that a ton of fun
[5:01:13] logain_13: Not sure about SoD raids, but I doubt they're as hard as normal retail
[5:01:14] wax357: people were hyping up MC and BWL to be the true race only to find out it gets cleared in 30 mins
[5:01:14] Razzlee: I am a retail player that plays classic now in downtime of retail season with SOD
[5:01:15] Benjg7: I pigged 6/6 gnomer the day I hit 40, to say that was as hard as our ce fyrakk is delusional
[5:01:18] Teddsan: cata is more retail level of raiding tho
[5:01:20] elliVVille: fielding a raid team of 40 idiots is the hardest part lol
[5:01:22] freehawk1: Compare BFD classic to BFD retail. Yeah. I think you can tell which game is harder (better).
[5:01:30] panacer: theres some gnomer fights that are like, normal raid difficulty
[5:01:32] zen0vae: classic is too easy, theres no progression outside of leveling
[5:01:37] thenateo2: @logain_13 gnarlroot has more mechanics than all of gnomer
[5:01:51] highcard2: "Ya'll bitches needa stop hating" - Liquid Maximum
[5:01:57] Jumanjiqt: classic players are obsessed with retail and how much they dislike it. it's borderline their whole personality
[5:02:07] weaselss: OH YOU HATE PUBG NOW? FORTNITE IS SHIT MAN WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT
[5:02:08] Mezzedii: theyre just bored in their own life
[5:02:12] Dolphinos7: New maps ruined pubg is the equivalent
[5:02:14] zen0vae: sod raids are like heroic dungeons, minimal effort
[5:02:24] nemziac: its a chat room to hate on wow retail for some reason
[5:02:28] ZizzTV: the true compare in this metapher would be pubg players hatin about fortnite to be honest BuddhaBar
[5:02:31] logain_13: @thenateo2 For sure. They only complicating factor is classic characters have fewer tools...but I'd definitely guess retail is harder at every difficulty level
[5:02:38] Niksen_99: Retail andys care more about retail vs classic than classic andys do
[5:02:39] thesupplier69: there are a lot of classic players who love and respect retail but also enjoy being good at a game and classic is easier
[5:02:42] ohhgreatnoob: living rent free in thei brains is truly wild
[5:02:43] Joneim: Very strange behaviour
[5:02:44] rezalis_: retail lives rent free in every classic andy's brain
[5:02:47] auby6: crazy ex bf/gf vibes
[5:02:48] freehawk1: I think you are just mad that the game you are playing is just not that good. It's okay. You can play a game that is low quality
[5:02:49] alarkin: If you dedicate 9 hours a week to raid with 19 people, you should be given a reasonable chance to see the capstone content. Not a guarantee, but a reasonable chance. The time you give matters, or at least it should. Again, the missing 1000s of 4-8/9M guilds is just completely absent in this conversation, and that's bad. I wish we heard more from them. Imagining raiding a difficulty you could clear 2 years ago or 4 years ago, and the barrier to entry just decided to exclude permanently.
[5:02:50] glitsmonk: its similar to like always trying to keep up with an ex
[5:02:50] Andyto02: not really the same tho pubg dead
[5:03:00] Boreall: That's a lie
[5:03:01] thenateo2: thats not true OMEGALUL
[5:03:01] Joneim: xdd
[5:03:02] fleks27: ok tinfoil hat take but maybe you see it more right now because SoD p2 is insanely empty
[5:03:04] lorddustdevil: easier to call a game bad that admit youre bad
[5:03:04] KillUAssie: it’s next level weird vibes
[5:03:05] guynormally: having nothing going on in your life isn't inherently a bad thing, but choosing to do stupid things with that time is kinda bad
[5:03:06] Joneim: Lets just make shit up
[5:03:06] Jazzarus_: not true
[5:03:07] zen0vae: first Gnomer run was raid finder difficulty
[5:03:08] logain_13: @Niksen_99 No shot
[5:03:09] Boreall: That's straight up a lie
[5:03:11] tykus21: not true in my experience
[5:03:12] iMuru: never
[5:03:13] Velvuri: no its the other way around
[5:03:13] fdb33: @Maximum I will say, I watch a lot of classic streams and never see retail brought up, and in retail streams see retail players bring up classsic people hating retail (which I dont see personally as playing both)
[5:03:13] gwenmh: lol
[5:03:13] Falzyker: Retail people don't give a shit about classic 9/10 times
[5:03:13] Fray24_: nope lol
[5:03:14] Oracle_WoW: thats insanely false.
[5:03:19] HarmonyFart: @Niksen_99 No, hell no, naw.
[5:03:19] taribrah: absolutely not
[5:03:28] wax357: that's like 100% not true lol. Retail players live rent free in Classic Andys heads
[5:03:30] Elnaaa: Some classic players are just lifeless neckbeards it is what it is KEKW
[5:03:30] BobDaBilda: But it's not quite the same, because you're not playing "PUBG Classic", where the main game still exists, and is by name associated with the game you're playing, so it gets a mention a lot, and you have to have conversations about it in your circles.
[5:03:31] mxgxbx: world first icc was harder than fyrakk
[5:03:32] Viisionz74: Viisionz74 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! I like classic wow because its my side game besides like console games i prefer classic's world building while you are leveling but I prefer Retail wows endgame because i like mythic raiding and high keys although leveling in classic wow is that jam
[5:03:36] i_Static: no chance lmao
[5:03:38] kyydh: @Niksen_99 lmao
[5:03:39] SneakyWoodPecker: is everyone forgetting all of the classic people screaming NO CHANGES
[5:03:46] Mezzedii: the thing is classic has been around in some form for 20 years you have to be a special kind of person to enjoy doing the same content for 20 years
[5:03:49] iCarDog: people's need to justify their divorce from the game is so odd
[5:03:53] guynormally: "it's bean real"
[5:03:56] zen0vae: < the guy who plays all versions
[5:03:56] Joneim: The classic new SOD raid wiped for an hour because they didnt kick xdd
[5:03:57] Oracle_WoW: retail is a topic in most classic streams on a daily basis
[5:04:00] reggiepowa: yeah thats how it is with me as well, I have no idea whats going on with classic
[5:04:03] gwenmh: no retail player says that they should stop making classic, you see a ton of the opposite
[5:04:04] thatboyjem: As a retail player playing SoD currently they definitely think about retail way more
[5:04:06] Arvakr: A LOT
[5:04:07] reymargera: Classic wowhead commetns
[5:04:07] mxgxbx: @iCarDog asmongold goes through this with wow twice a night
[5:04:10] gonzi86: I am pretty much mid core, I don't have time to raid but we are doing 25s and on smold and lots of us play both
[5:04:11] auby6: its bc they think classic is the better version of wow, and they hate retail bc it "ruined" wow
[5:04:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: Retail people either double dip retail and classic. OR they simply don't give a shit about classic. It's that simple.
[5:04:20] Nekleb: How can Blizzard make enhancement shaman viable in higher keys?
[5:04:28] 107GOATY: you play classic the way you play an arpg. it's more about the journey to getting BIS than your accomplishments
[5:04:31] Boreall: As a Classic player, it's common to think of "Retail WoW" as whatever expansion they quit WoW in, so they hate WoD, or SL, or BFA etc. We also have a huge "Siphoned playerbase" PTSD because there are 5 versions of the game now
[5:04:35] fleks27: reminds me of people on twitter claiming classic has more active players
[5:04:35] bigpoppa59: im a classic player and im literally 100% certain 9/11 would never have happened if retail didn't come out
[5:04:36] fdb33: I will say, I watch a lot of classic streams and never see retail brought up, and in retail streams see retail players bring up classic people hating retail (which I dont see personally as someone playing both)
[5:04:40] iCarDog: @mxgxbx it's actually insane
[5:04:46] kyydh: @Nekleb LUL
[5:04:48] DanWhyNot: Anyone playing SOD that just got banned ?
[5:04:50] RandyTheRam1: retail players just trying to play retail and not thinking about classic. not sure why classic people are obsessed with retail
[5:04:56] B3AR1TAS: i see people in general chat on Retail talking about how retail sucks and classic is amazing. I don't get it. go play classic if that's your thing, why go out of your way to bring people down?
[5:04:58] BobDaBilda: Only Twitter / Twitch people, who don't exist in real life.
[5:05:01] elricx: classic is boring tbh
[5:05:06] zen0vae: classic is nice and casual, good leveling world experience. Retail has great endgame gear prog and difficulty ramping.
[5:05:10] Suwah84: I think classic takes player population from retail which I don’t agree with but it’s whatever
[5:05:23] logain_13: @fdb33 guzu and xaryu spend literal hours watching critiques of retail. I enjoy them, but it's a pretty common topic with some of the most popular classic streamers
[5:05:25] heat31: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Duncan and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another captain, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I’m a genetic freak and I’m not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Ruby York to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down.
[5:05:30] HarmonyFart: I dont give a shit about classic, I started playing late vanilla and have never thought "Oh wow I wanna do that shit again :)"
[5:05:31] ASmart_Alex: goblin mode
[5:05:33] undertreex: undertreex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[5:05:33] bjoerntorb: there are some weird twitter people that talk 24/7 about retail raids and shit on classic raids
[5:05:37] Arvakr: Alter ego
[5:05:37] Goats48: thats me
[5:05:39] Regroot_Gaming: @Maximum  React to asmongold video over blizzard randomly banning ppl on SOD , fun content to see on you tube with my morning coffee lol .
[5:05:39] alarkin: I had some raiders ragequit my guild when classic launched because they saw other people in the guild playing it lol.
[5:05:40] Pannitra: i won’t touch classic after i learned how easy the hardest content is, but i have friends and guildies from retail that like it, so i don’t see why i should put them down for it
[5:05:41] Y0L01989: I have a feeling that the real question here is what is the point of Mythic raid as a source of engagement after RTWF and Hall of Fame and the fact that the above two dictate the tuning of the raid for all players that don't reach  "the roof of the world".
[5:05:42] i_Static: they’re just dumb online bc of anonymity
[5:05:42] KeyboardDeath: goblin mode
[5:05:43] Siraeyou: Anonymity makes people completely unhinged
[5:05:43] Jazzarus_: it's fun
[5:05:48] BLACKFOOT_TN: The people losing their shit about retail vs classic. Are typically the same goobers losing their shit over dumb shit on X. Normal people just show up to game.
[5:05:50] bjoerntorb: but like most retail players either play both or just dont hate classic
[5:05:50] guynormally: rippin' mad farts on the keys
[5:05:53] HeyImNexxus: thjey play alot of league too im sure
[5:06:05] itsheavydude: because there are no consequences for their actions online
[5:06:07] zen0vae: if only they could merge the best parts of classic and retail. sod aint it
[5:06:07] ThreesFG: Have little agency in life, but I can control this keyboard
[5:06:09] auby6: i wasnt born with hinges kid
[5:06:16] Joneim: "Randomly" xdd
[5:06:17] malnourish_: nope
[5:06:25] Niksen_99: How come retail is so dead on twitch
[5:06:31] Joneim: @Niksen_99 Off season
[5:06:40] BLACKFOOT_TN: Randomly......
[5:06:41] heeriam: I think retail is good and I wouldn't go back to classic even though the memories from vanilla were the best. The problem I have is that retail is so insanely addon-heavy and bloated with visuals. M+ and raids are all about looking at weakauras-tracking, huge nameplates bloated with buffs/debuffs, and trying to see anything with all the flashy spells and area effects everywhere. I need a god damn weakaura cross to see my own char (Yeah I know it's in the center of screen but even so)
[5:06:52] thenateo2: TRUE KEKW
[5:06:52] itsgamz: People who death roll during break in raid etc
[5:06:55] Synk_live: @Niksen_99 all the content is done really, nothing worth watching to many unless its someone they like watching
[5:06:57] reymargera: PepeLaugh
[5:07:00] Prycey: @Niksen_99 Off-season and Twitch doesn't dictate player base
[5:07:02] facetheface: But its on reddit its gotta be true
[5:07:04] Faraday5001: @Niksen_99 it isnt whenever theres new content.... same as classic
[5:07:06] Schanuk: second account andys get banned cause they send gold to their main :D
[5:07:07] zen0vae: most people banned are actually buying gold yeah
[5:07:08] Regroot_Gaming: Watch the video , you'll see lots of screenshots of lots of innocent players actually getting banned for " asking questions over stuff "
[5:07:10] KillUAssie: can we bet beef jerky?
[5:07:14] surpriseparty20: They want to ban GDKP's but they don't have almost any GM's anymore. It's a big problem
[5:07:27] kyydh: @heeriam age check
[5:07:29] rezalis_: CAUGHT Calm down Blizz it was just a deathroll
[5:07:55] Niksen_99: Even when its retail season Classic dominates on twitch @Prycey
[5:07:57] Boreall: Season of Discovery is having a huge amount of false positives
[5:08:01] dburnnzz: huh, they can definitely see who traded them the gold in the first place
[5:08:04] deathbunnyz_: @Y0L01989 because not everything has to be a "be the best of the best" grind? I'm shooting for CE, I don't care that I'm not fighting the hardest boss possible, it's still fun and I'll enjoy my personal achievement when I get there.
[5:08:13] PhoenixAmethyst: I played back in 2004 and i guess i am a retail only player now but i will pop into classic and have fun but then remember how un-time friendly classic is. Also back in the day only like 50 guilds raided if even maybe more during classic and game was way harder than modern day classic
[5:08:21] heeriam: @kyydh You're not wrong
[5:08:23] zenkodac: @regroot_gaming why do i feel thats big bs?
[5:08:35] kyydh: @heeriam just joking xd
[5:08:36] zen0vae: gdkps were harmful to the economy
[5:08:37] Yeolbootz: theres no customer support to reverse the false positives even with proof
[5:08:37] Clush___: @PhoenixAmethyst classic aint nobody reading all that classic
[5:08:38] panacer: Not all of it Max!!!1! only 90%
[5:08:45] Niksen_99: 4Head why not just add wow token perfect solution
[5:08:51] guynormally: @Clush___ i did Nerdge
[5:08:53] Regroot_Gaming: @zenkodac you can see for yourself , either watch the video or start reading news with evidence .
[5:08:53] panacer: some people farmed all that gold in maradon!
[5:08:53] Dzor12: @PhoenixAmethyst firstGarf
[5:08:57] heeriam: @kyydh Still, you're not wrong ^^
[5:08:57] MrAndersen_: " game was way harder than modern day" HUH
[5:09:00] Turtok_Sayf: @Clush___ i did :)
[5:09:05] Prycey: @Niksen_99 But Twitch doesn't dictate player base, so your point is kinda useless LUL
[5:09:08] Elthendine: Elthendine subscribed with Prime. 
[5:09:12] str6lch: @Maximum raidboosting these days is a high percentile RMT, it drops prices and blizzard doesnt do jackshit :) talking about retail btw.
[5:09:13] BonafideQ: @PhoenixAmethyst it wasnt harder back then, we just have way more information/access to information now
[5:09:16] zen0vae: people get banned for a good reason lol
[5:09:19] fleks27: i have lend people several hundreds of gold in sod and no1 got banned
[5:09:21] Niksen_99: Noone even mentioned playerbase KEKW @Prycey
[5:09:32] fleks27: so high doubt on the "mass of innocent people being banned"
[5:09:41] PhoenixAmethyst: tech limited us to what we could do back then
[5:09:42] BLACKFOOT_TN: I mean I used to get banned all the time back in MoP. But then.......I was botting lol.
[5:09:42] zenkodac: "I'm not guilty i swear" is as old as people have existed, no one just believes that
[5:09:45] sethron: did you see the guy that opened the ticket trying to repeal a ban when he wasn't banned and the response basically said he violated TOS
[5:10:01] Jazzarus_: I know people dont like the token, but I like it cause I dont pay for anything with money, I farm BoEs get gold and pay my game time and buy expansions with the tokens I get from that gold.
[5:10:04] AcidFiol: @fleks27 Were they random people, or people you have played with before / on your friendlist
[5:10:06] zenkodac: Is a argument*
[5:10:06] str6lch: @Maximum RMT is handled thru advertisers of boosting communites.
[5:10:08] cptjohnnnn: i jsut got banned lol for 9 days
[5:10:12] Samuraiz: RMT?
[5:10:14] Razzlee: I think what makes it worst is that they fired all CS team so people are getting AI bot responses when trying to appeal @Maximum
[5:10:16] Boreall: 90% of Heroic sales are RMT
[5:10:17] auby6: 10 LoL accounts couldnt be me
[5:10:27] Faraday5001: @Boreall no shot
[5:10:29] dburnnzz: its RMT for the same reason you said, most people are buying their gold for real money
[5:10:30] fleks27: @AcidFiol the claim of some people i heard is they got false banned for trading friends gold, so obv friends
[5:10:32] str6lch: @Boreall what he says ye
[5:10:35] fleks27: im not lending gold to a random
[5:10:38] JustDivis: @samuraiz real money trading
[5:10:38] MoleDude: @Boreall love making shit up
[5:10:44] Darkenet: but you cant know where the gold you get for boosting comes from
[5:10:48] glitsmonk: why doesnt blizz for retail gold buying? you buy multiple gold caps and nothing happens
[5:10:50] RandaIFire: heroic is still run by discords adn the top guys rmt it
[5:10:52] greyst: you can buy a full heroic clear for like $20
[5:10:54] zen0vae: heroic boost ez
[5:10:55] kyydh: @Samuraiz real money trade
[5:10:55] deathbunnyz_: @MoleDude it's actually 110% of sales
[5:10:59] BiblibobEUWest: Did the mdi games end?
[5:11:00] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121355 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_maximum #ad
[5:11:02] moash_: Dude half my guild are rmt heroic booster
[5:11:03] dburnnzz: yeah agree about the guild side
[5:11:03] Laiikhuna: No way it's 90%, I've sold personally sold heroic runs with gold a bunch
[5:11:09] brutalmotionz: download SOD right now and start playing you wont
[5:11:10] str6lch: @RandaIFire exactly.
[5:11:11] bentech112: Done with Helldivers?
[5:11:12] MoleDude: @deathbunnyz_ finally an accurate statement
[5:11:19] MeisterChiefX: a lot of people circumvent the wow token still
[5:11:22] prom3e: what else is there to do late season, finished raiding, and nothing left to do besides key and i want to keep playing but just bored they need a better endgame
[5:11:24] NYKO7_: firstGarf
[5:11:27] Mezzedii: no one farams KEKW
[5:11:38] Boreall: @Laiikhuna Maybe you're the 10%, but the VAST majority of sales are gold sales for guilds to sell the gold
[5:11:41] dburnnzz: yeah agreed, thats not on the guild
[5:11:46] dburnnzz: but theres just as much rmt in retail as classic
[5:11:49] yeesper: @Mezzedii civs do
[5:11:54] Ristvakbaen1911: What's the Fyrakk M mount going for LuL
[5:11:55] Skorgg: is it RMT if I pay gold for and Instant Dollars carry?
[5:11:59] zeniath1: @prom3e farm rio =P
[5:12:05] Regroot_Gaming: Have you seen the automated responds people are getting slammed with when they appeal , and whether they just making a ban appeal ticket with a random question when their accounts are not banned , there are almost no real human works in the customer service , its all just bunch of bots responded with copy pasta automated message , shit is funny
[5:12:07] Laiikhuna: All of the trade spam selling for gold?
[5:12:13] auby6: so if i walked up to you on the street and handed you 1k for a fyrak kill
[5:12:15] fdb33: Guilds should just sell gold then buyers can use that gold to buy M runs oh wait
[5:12:18] Tarthris: aintnoway
[5:12:21] deathbunnyz_: @Skorgg RMT = real money
[5:12:22] procotwitch: Just add it as a wow shop option, follower heroic raid $19.99 KEKW
[5:12:23] fleks27: they made a classic addon to translate gold to real money value
[5:12:24] Mezzedii: if you spend more time farming than just spending $20 you need a better job
[5:12:28] Niksen_99: wow token is also rmt
[5:12:30] zen0vae: retail RMT is through wow tokens more than anything else
[5:12:32] fdb33: Theres def more on classic
[5:12:33] fleks27: do you know how much rmt has to happen for that to exist
[5:12:33] malnourish_: 1000000%
[5:12:34] Tarthris: in retail you just pay blizzard for gold
[5:12:34] prom3e: @zeniath1 im at 3.2k and i just feel bored idk i wanna play more but theres less to do
[5:12:34] Roydaboy2: 10000% more on classic lmao
[5:12:35] thenateo2: unless you consider wow token rmt @Maximum
[5:12:35] MuuRetsu: there is A LOT more gold buying on classic
[5:12:37] BLACKFOOT_TN: Retail just buy a wow token.
[5:12:39] tenassity69: gold is war more valuable on classic. not shit to do with golf on retail
[5:12:42] arakthar: that would be an awesome case study
[5:12:43] Viisionz74: Dont need money on retail to play the game expect like a few k
[5:12:44] massiven548: gold isnt very relevant on retail
[5:12:45] zerossussy: rmt on retail isn't as tragic at all
[5:12:54] freehawk1: because it is
[5:12:55] Mischievous_TV: is rmt a slur
[5:12:57] Prycey: @Ristvakbaen1911 I don't know about every guild but I know echo charges 13.5m for Mythic fyrakk
[5:12:58] zerossussy: yea gold is irrelevant
[5:13:07] starcraft_t_v: is ingame gold not 99% rmt by proxy for boosts?
[5:13:11] guynormally: you're stretching terms if you say wow token is rmt
[5:13:14] zen0vae: way more third party transactions on classic
[5:13:14] Gryffin2009: @Maximum can you tell us about your struggles being the hottest raid leader in WoW?
[5:13:16] gouldinglol: rmt implies tos breaking
[5:13:16] DasAutoChat: well i assume its alot of indirect RMT LUL
[5:13:18] itsheavydude: we call it visiting Korea
[5:13:21] Clush___: @Maximum literally every key pusher i know buys gold through non-wow-tokens lol
[5:13:21] fdb33: thing is retail wow token giuves a significant amount of gold, classic gives shit all gold
[5:13:26] Mezzedii: YEP
[5:13:29] anotherMrGr33N: imo, WoW Token is not RMT because you can't gain real money from it
[5:13:31] Regroot_Gaming: @Gryffin2009 dude chill
[5:13:31] ruuuudyyyy: pokiPOP
[5:13:31] BoonieBones: RMT definitely means giving dollars to not the company who makes the game
[5:13:44] Mezzedii: blizz should just adjust their token to match the RMT community and boom no more shady dealing
[5:13:49] dburnnzz: idk the amount of people in the boosting discord that still exist, would very much surprise me if the majority of that gold is from wow tokens vs actual buying sites/ discords
[5:13:55] BLACKFOOT_TN: My buddy did a mythic carry raid the other day. His share was over 1 mil gold. So its easy to make if your a champion.
[5:13:57] Cntrl11120: RMT is basically you using money to buy a service that wasnt funded by the company (not just blizzard)
[5:13:57] glitsmonk: rmt in retail is kinda like steroids in mlb. just let em do it
[5:14:05] i_Static: is buying gold from not blizzard banable in retail?
[5:14:16] prom3e: any other mmos to play while waiting for s4?
[5:14:29] jesuslouise: Aware
[5:14:30] fleks27: the only thing that competes with classic rmt was challenge mode rmt times
[5:14:31] floodoec: gold farming is pretty decent bc you end up getitng paid with a higher value currency
[5:14:39] Boreall: People seriously don't understand that selling gold is a literal job
[5:14:42] mxgxbx: venezuelans were killing green dragons in runescape to feed their families not even a meme
[5:14:43] BLACKFOOT_TN: So SA guilds are RMT and not NA guilds. Got it.
[5:14:44] Mezzedii: i think they would just move from wow to another games RMTing
[5:14:46] fdb33: WoW needs to just ban all countries below a certain minimum wage ez $
[5:14:49] thendj: not true pvpers came out saying they were making 80K+ a year doing carries
[5:14:51] Jazzarus_: I'm from Venezuela, I have friends that earn a living from skinning mobs, LUL
[5:14:54] Ristvakbaen1911: There's a reason Venezualan's (iirc) do so much OSRS botting and gold selling
[5:14:57] fdb33: Heard it from Max first
[5:14:59] guynormally: @fdb33 xdd
[5:15:00] willpulliam: Yeah i have friends that play online card games for minimum wage but they are in 3rd world countries living comfortable
[5:15:03] edit93: don't forget many of them don't pay taxes at all so its good money
[5:15:11] Harderx88: @Jazzarus_ in game right? Monka
[5:15:13] PhutureX: @Maximum there are easter europeans making more money with RMT than doctors in their country
[5:15:17] Mischievous_TV: I just think about the whole gallywix debacle and remember the owner was from like croatia or something so he walked away with being set for life from rmt
[5:15:21] Jazzarus_: @Harderx88 of course LUL
[5:15:22] schmoogiebear: do you get paid well @Maximum
[5:15:24] wobble_tv: once the cost of business is met anything above that is pure profit so the margins are crazy for sellers
[5:15:25] caputo233: RMT in Asian countries is quite accepted, a lot of big guilds over there are more like employees than players at times
[5:15:31] Arvakr: Max can you post more dog videos on twitter
[5:15:31] nightst314: half of the people farming zaralek caverns on EU are gold farmers from 2nd/3rd world countries
[5:15:32] harris01_: there is no way dude
[5:15:32] dburnnzz: yeah, i dont really think its a problem in retail, but i do think theres a lot more rmt than people realize. maybe because the impact isnt as bad to the majority of people
[5:15:35] Harderx88: @Jazzarus_ hey y ou never know Kappa
[5:15:35] auby6: imagine if they just gave us gold per month of sub instead of tenders
[5:15:41] Alpha_Duck: do you think those people see us herbing and think why is this guy even bothering he cant pay rent from that like me
[5:15:42] fleks27: one gdkp leader posted a picture of their new car and flat in discord
[5:15:45] fleks27: PepeLaugh
[5:15:45] johanoxd: Have u seen the runescape venezuela situation
[5:15:47] sulfitv: 70% of world make 1US$ day
[5:15:47] BLACKFOOT_TN: Yeah but EU people go turbo hard in WoW vs NA people.
[5:15:49] edit93: i know a russian guy he made like 3k euros during classic in maraudon xD
[5:15:50] nima_senpai: im iranian and i know about discord server that sales HC raid and they are doing full rmt and gain more than half full jobs here
[5:15:50] Kimolainen: In Italy doctors generally earn crap around 2k euro a month, in Norway 5 ti 6 k
[5:15:51] ASmart_Alex: insurance companies lol
[5:15:53] Y0L01989: @deathbunnyz_ Keyword - engagement. We have a certain amount of bosses each tier that tend to exist as a breaking point for guilds. The overall frustration with these fights leads to players quitting the game - which is not good in the long term for a variety of reasons.
[5:15:53] guynormally: the health insurance companies
[5:15:54] ofossheim: the insurance companies bro
[5:15:55] itsgamz: know several middle eastern people with 2k heroic kills so far this tier
[5:15:56] surpriseparty20: Doctors for what they offer and how long it takes to become one are very underpaid where I live
[5:16:00] gwenmh: they also dont have to pay 200k+ to get their degree
[5:16:01] HekticFox: insurance & pharma not doctors
[5:16:03] Fizzbot125: Lmao no it all goes to the hospital admin and insurance cos
[5:16:05] Lucybell: in my country cancer treatment free
[5:16:05] zen0vae: they pay a lot of money to malpractice insurance, its not as much as you think
[5:16:06] Dumpy_Gaming: insurance makes a lot
[5:16:06] sethomatic: insurance companies are making the money, not doctors
[5:16:07] willpulliam: @Maximum Did you see the thing where the BUCKYs bathroom managers make more than EU doctors
[5:16:07] cachalott: I'm a doctor in france and it's not that true
[5:16:12] Alikoli: @maximum administration is making way more dollars than doctors
[5:16:12] profplur: the insurance companies and hospitals
[5:16:15] Niksen_99: First week of Classic in 2019 1000 gold was worth 5k usd @Maximum
[5:16:20] Oraghon: also the education to become a doctor puts you in alot of debt in america KEKW
[5:16:20] tempehst11: insurance
[5:16:27] tempehst11: and pharma
[5:16:31] ofossheim: unnecessary middle man
[5:16:35] thenateo2: whats a hospital bill
[5:16:36] burnunit_: brother-in-law is an ER doctor - he makes bank, but he also works 60+ hours a week
[5:16:37] Slapsstick: doctors dont usually make the money straight up unless its their own practice
[5:16:38] MeisterChiefX: they definitely are
[5:16:39] ASmart_Alex: hospital prices are set because insurance pays for it
[5:16:40] lastericalive: insurance companies negotiate those prices
[5:16:42] tyler_erind: Insurance companies don't make money off premiums
[5:16:45] haro5: just american things
[5:16:46] aridty: a doctor in the US only makes big bucks when they are fully trained. So aftrer 5-8 years. before then its like 60k for 60 hours a week
[5:16:46] Mischievous_TV: pay to hold your baby btw
[5:16:48] tallcasper: no, they make money by rejecting claims
[5:16:50] Saece: its only insane because of insurance though
[5:16:51] tyler_erind: Also they have private pricing with each hospital
[5:16:51] profplur: it's bc there's insurance companies
[5:16:51] zen0vae: 35k to stay overnight
[5:16:54] sethomatic: because that has been negotiated with hospital
[5:16:56] wobble_tv: you have the office visit, the dr bill, the physician bill, the walk in bill - the itemization is wild
[5:16:56] BigTrout3: american health care prices aren't real in the slightest.
[5:16:57] Fizzbot125: It costs that much because the hospital is farming the insurance company
[5:16:59] fdb33: Hospitalbills r insanely high because insurance companies negotiate down from there
[5:16:59] mawster: US healthcare is pretty fucked :D we do that way better in europe
[5:17:00] mycho_: YEP
[5:17:01] logain_13: health insurance, pharmaceuticals, doctors, hospitals, everybody gets a cut of the profit (and hate each other by others trying to take their cut)
[5:17:05] BigTrout3: "negotiate" fucking false
[5:17:07] fyrhuvud: us healthcare is beyond fucked
[5:17:07] tempehst11: pharmaceuticals
[5:17:09] Kimolainen: spent 5 days i nthe hospital, insurance covered it but had to show me the bill nontheless. 77500 dollars for 5 days plus surgery for a broken damn foot
[5:17:10] profplur: yup
[5:17:10] anotherMrGr33N: *laughs in sécurité sociale*

[5:18:42] streatmagic_gaming: Max is a man of the people
[5:18:42] TooMuchVodkaa: they have a dark pattern design this year that makes you auto-select to put your tax return into a credit karma bank account that you've never created.

[5:19:15] nightst314: if you farm spores in zaralek caverns all day you can easily make up to 1 token in value per day
[5:19:16] Y0L01989: I'd say it's the other way around. 30% max.

[5:20:11] fdb33: @Maximum "The global median daily income was only $2.95 in 1990. By 2019, that median reached $7.56"
[5:20:14] Brotholomew13: @Maximum Do you think that them saying they'd pull the rip chord made it inevitable?

[5:20:43] auby6: i want them to stop with external buffs and raid buffs, i want my dmg to be my dmg THD is never wrong
[5:20:45] fdb33: @yelp26 so 12.5%, not 70%
[5:20:45] logain_13: balance would be terrible if they do that

[5:21:15] wobble_tv: introducing buffs to classes seems super fun though imo, even if they are overpowered/sluggish
[5:21:16] logain_13: depends on how healing limited the fights are
[5:21:18] LeoricDidNothingWrong: make it leech based
[5:21:19] neblak: xdd
