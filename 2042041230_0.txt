[0:50:20] lil_sammy87: i dont feel like m+ is grinding... each run feels different, depending on the group youre with (and if its the same people but different toons, thats different too)

[0:56:43] itsClubby: tbh fair comment
[0:57:26] Adalinadraenor: idrops

[1:01:05] TotallyNotRaien: not enough yelling in peoples faces for me
[1:02:05] chekky: tbf I dont think the dev  team plays highkeys. Otherwise they whould seen stuff much earlier
[1:02:05] AceReformed: what the hell are you doing here this early HUH good morning caro n chat
[1:02:37] VipMalis: high level key scaling doesn't really matter, you will reach some kind of wall eventually. Your competing against other players on who can reach the highest
[1:02:59] astreinoid: the scaling of dmg of you and scaling of mob hp is so that you can complete higher dungeons the longer the expansion runs... which is a good thing
[1:03:06] TotallyNotRaien: but the wall shouldnt be absolute one shots

[1:03:20] TotallyNotRaien: it should be the timer, since it exists why not use it
[1:03:40] angelxwind12: I'm too new to get an opinion about this
[1:03:49] chekky: I whould liek the concept more if u dont have enough dmg then not survive certains mechanics cause I dont play the right class for it

[1:03:59] kuga_milano: like chekky said, they just copied the diablo rifts. And after the powercreep over the years, its does not work anymore because we as players didnt scale like the m+ keys.

[1:05:31] chekky: or like brh tyrann highkey. If I dont play dh who can leech himself against the swarm and deal dmg u just die in 2 ticks
[1:05:49] envenom7: then they would have to treat every m+ level like a raid boss, at least numbers, not mechanics. meaning not let it scale on itself with some general formula, but for each level
[1:06:08] konkelamo: so basically it should only be a race against the timer?
[1:06:22] Djbunny162: They could also make a cap for damage and health, but start reducing the key timer.

[1:12:41] AceReformed: I am doing great, just had eggs and ham been listening to your rant KEKW
[1:13:00] scream_cha: what's your goal for M+ runs?
[1:13:07] Vtal: Aug is trash
[1:13:14] punkio1993: you gotta love sitting in queue 40-80min for one dungeon/pug raid invite
[1:13:23] y0rge: abt  game with pre mage party is better then pug
[1:13:29] y0rge: any*
[1:13:34] remisangaia: hello thanks for live for drop twich
[1:13:37] AceReformed: No, no they really dont want too
[1:13:39] AceReformed: That's another topic
[1:13:43] angelxwind12: yeap PUGGER here
[1:13:45] lobuzEU: its amazing how my kids react when im watching your stream ;) still talking why mommy is on monitor you have clone in poland because she looks like you :DDD
[1:13:50] AceReformed: Everyone wants to play M+, no one wants to pug M+

[1:14:02] kuga_milano: i loved m+ in legion tbh. now its just meh. dont like it, maybe im just fed up with running the same dungeon over and over again
[1:14:06] smeyve: They should fix Xavuis somehow about the puddles idk, that dude is stand casting too much
[1:14:57] y0rge: i remember in legion when you do 25+ with pugs sometimes they wanted discord now no one even sugest it
[1:15:26] skyw0ww: If you have team playing with aug is fine but if you are pugging aug is totally mistake cus they dont know where to use deffansive and their ebon might uptime like %55-60
[1:15:48] AceReformed: Also to add to your earlier discussion about damage, the only thing that should matter in top-end M+ is personal responabilities (Think kicks, dodging mechanics)and damage output, unavoidables should just be combo'd with other lethal stuff that can be migated by playing properly / positioning properly, this entire oneshot fest on tyrannical 27+ is why i can't be bothered getting more score, sitting in Q for 2h+ waiting for an aug or getting invited at all is stupid af @Naguura
[1:15:53] AceReformed: Also holy wlal of text
[1:16:17] Crisette_: XD

[1:17:04] Crisette_: the amount of weird rng there is   this season takes the fun of it, i get a mechanic, and use defensive, get it again
[1:17:29] AceReformed: For example on archmage in EB, the fire on the ground should do way more damage, and the intitial channel shouldnt do an insane damage like it does now @Naguura
[1:17:29] smeyve: I think you love last BRH boss on tyra P1 random bolt, bear form uptime close to 80%

[2:24:43] Mikey1678: when does the new season begin
[2:24:44] angelxwind12: Yeah everyone has different opinions. All valid

[3:46:18] Deenial: Literally, cos nothing pisses me off more than when I pick up a burger and the bun slides cos the inside is so wet. I already know if I'll like it from the moment I pick it up
[3:46:28] MaseratiPrime: Lime is delicious. Not sure how anyone would ever consider something being full of lime a negative.

[3:48:39] AethriIl: eating burger with fork isn't that bad it tastes different and you feel more of each ingridient
[3:48:43] TotallyNotRaien: would you prefer multiple mini burgers over a giant one?

[4:25:35] tea2468: @TotallyNotRaien naguuraThinking
[4:25:48] iStreamSunday: yeah it has categories for things included in prime but the gui is pretty sloppy and they mix them together a lot

[4:27:13] Hodacia: Prime is pretty cheap compared to others tho
[4:27:16] moolygos: its really scummy to both a subscription and not include certain stuff in subscription(applies to WoW as well)
[4:27:32] Kuroz: buffs are bugging everywhere
[4:27:37] Galackticko: frost dk Oo
[4:27:51] iStreamSunday: even worse they are adding ads to even prime videos soon you have to pay for the “ad-free” tier lol
[4:27:57] MooniexVibes: wel I mean…. wow the only things not included are cosmetics so you don’t have to buy them
[4:28:32] tea2468: we have to buy the game plus pay for the subscription too
[4:28:47] Kuroz: debuffs are module related except you have some old ones you added manually that still work. so it's 2 different issues. whitelist for debuffs and then it scans for random debuffs on target, like timewarp and the scaling one

[4:36:00] MaseratiPrime: Naguura, game journalist.
[4:36:05] Sebleh: the other thing is that being a games caster doesn’t require you to be a super consistent streamer anyway so you could expand on casting without streaming
[4:36:19] Amresh: professional asian pasta reviewer
[4:36:35] zoonammi: e sports caster

[4:39:00] MaseratiPrime: @Kedor2k Someone was *wrong* on the internet.
[4:39:12] Galackticko: Nagura streaming in 70 years old Kappa
[4:39:25] tea2468: you don't want a normal job
[4:39:27] MooniexVibes: you don’t want a normal 9-5

[4:39:43] Sebleh: nothing’s stopping you from having normal hours nagoogoo naguuraSip
[4:40:00] RigelOrionis: I don't want to work at 9 am
[4:40:04] MooniexVibes: I specifically like my corporate job because when I leave nothing matters
[4:40:08] Bytebard_: guys is feral good now  ?
[4:40:10] MaseratiPrime: I don't want to work.
[4:40:12] Deenial: I think it's more as a content creator you don't really get to "turn it off" where as having a 9-5 means there's always an end to your work day
[4:40:13] Deenial: Yeee
[4:40:23] MooniexVibes: any class can be good
[4:40:51] iStreamSunday: yeah total hours worked is something to consider, although even with a “regular” job stress/work can follow you home
[4:40:55] Sebleh: that’s modern tech tho. you think my job doesn’t expect me to be on top of things 24/7 or work after hours?
[4:41:09] CoffeeCoffeeCoffeehouse: sounds pretty stressfull
[4:41:12] Sebleh: I’m expected to answer emails on the weekend sometimes. I don’t, but I’m supposed to.
[4:41:27] CoffeeCoffeeCoffeehouse: a big mental load I imagine
[4:41:40] leavedevil: any job worth the $$$ will have you stress 24/7 basically
[4:41:48] Kedor2k: Not many jobs are like that - at least from my experience
[4:41:50] MooniexVibes: I refuse to be contacted after my working hours, I am paid for 40 hours, so unless they are gonna pay me more for the hours and I mean a good chunk more, they get nothing :)
[4:42:05] BitbinderGaming: I'm so glad my tech job doesn't require on call @sebleh
[4:42:08] Adalinadraenor: what do you work with ?
[4:42:44] leavedevil: biggest problem with regular jobs is that yo'ure
[4:42:49] leavedevil: you're tied with other ppl
[4:43:10] tea2468: I like this song!
[4:43:22] MaseratiPrime: Have you tried being unemployed? That's what I do.

[4:43:27] Galackticko: write who works where chat?:)
[4:43:34] iStreamSunday: regular jobs can be more stressful because you have a lot less control as well

[4:45:24] MaseratiPrime: I avoid all of this by collecting Universal Credit and PIP.
[4:45:30] devilyn_x: and ppl seing that im watching twitch is a great conversation started, me many ppl bc of this :D
[4:45:30] MooniexVibes: my office can see me watching twitch but if they have any complaints then they can try and fire me, but we are so understaffed and I’m good at my job so they wouldn’t dare :)
[4:45:51] Sebleh: seblehDepresso
[4:45:56] SM2IAR: I'm a pensioner, can recommend it... ;)
[4:45:58] Sebleh: nagoogoo y r u the worst? Smadge
[4:45:59] ThisIzD: Monday and Wednesday I work from home so its the only time i can really watch your stream because I am in NA and in the office during your normal stream times.
[4:46:09] Little_Dippin: people watching twitch at work trips me out. My whole career i've never even been allowed my phone in the office
[4:46:16] Sebleh: @mooniexvibes same kinda naguuraSip
[4:46:19] Little_Dippin: Like leave it outside the door not allowed
[4:46:34] Adalinadraenor: What is your job ?
[4:46:37] MooniexVibes: sounds like an archaic wordplay Dippin
[4:46:39] Volatilestyle: pet sitting
[4:46:41] ThisIzD: The perfect job is being rich enough to not have a job.
[4:46:41] MooniexVibes: *workplace
[4:46:44] devilyn_x: @Little_Dippin just work at an evil corporations and they wont care what you do until the job itself is done
[4:46:48] Galackticko: at the end of the dungeon everyone says good job, that means wow is work))
[4:46:49] Hades1228: "If you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life."
[4:46:55] eloburglar: zookeeper. but i find those hard to judge. u obviously love animals, but u keep them in prison
[4:46:59] Little_Dippin: Its just workplace security
[4:47:52] Little_Dippin: I work in Defence force for my country
[4:47:52] liquid_icecold: naa, if you work with what you love, you probably eventually start hating it XD work is work and it sucks
[4:48:10] iStreamSunday: I think other people play into as well, you could love your job but toxic people can ruin it
[4:48:25] devilyn_x: i love my job im just tired of the company, would love to do the same job at a different company :(
[4:48:30] y0rge: or they just need $$
[4:48:30] Sebleh: or maybe they just don’t want to do something else
[4:48:33] MooniexVibes: I used to train horses for a living. I loved horses, I loved competing and everything about it. two years in I absolutely hated it and it ruined riding horses for me
[4:48:39] Mikko_p1: Even when I am 80 years old I am gonna be gaming lol
[4:48:41] Sebleh: routines are comfy. they don’t bring any concerns or issues.
[4:48:42] MissSpank: I initially enjoyed what I do but now it's old.  Get to Good at it then bosses put so much on your plate its beyond stressful

[4:50:28] Sebleh: 11%
[4:50:32] kalamari__: mostly art department I have heard
[4:50:38] Mornex: AI can do the job better
[4:50:39] Sebleh: if you think Bobby Kotick was unique in the industry you are very wrong
[4:50:39] Lennerrt: greedy executives
[4:50:39] tea2468: I think because of AI
[4:50:40] fwankey: shareholders
[4:50:46] Auri_Angel: i know a programmer who also works outside of his working hours because he feels like it
[4:50:47] Se7enthSinn: because you dont need them
[4:50:47] Hades1228: A lot of companies overhired during Covid. Not thinking about what would happen when the pandemic ended.
[4:50:54] skyw0ww: 4min left she still reading chat :D
[4:50:54] MooniexVibes: automation
[4:50:56] Ouroboro48: money laundry is done
[4:50:56] tea2468: AI is doing the work of those roles I think
[4:50:58] Limdaer: Because they hired so many ppl during covid
[4:51:12] Adalinadraenor: A lot of businesses lost money and business during covid - and just before covid they hired massively due to succes
[4:51:22] HearMePuRR: What do you mean?? 10% layoffs are nothing. GLOBALLY... they have like 20 offices
[4:51:25] Se7enthSinn: didnt twitch do the same?
[4:51:30] kalamari__: working from home
[4:51:33] Adalinadraenor: many companies are going bankrupt now
[4:51:33] Limdaer: Its not they dont need them - they also shut down 2 projects..
[4:51:44] Sebleh: the lady that did the owlbear designs for WoW moved to Riot and got caught in the layoffs Smadge
[4:51:46] SpeciousArgument: because demand shifted during lockdown. suddenly everyone needs stuff for working at home
[4:51:50] Mornex: @Naguura AI does the job better and cheaper
[4:51:51] Hades1228: Demand for certain things was higher during covid.
[4:52:00] Bware2: expectations of future demand that didnt really come true
[4:52:01] fwankey: tech companies unironically see other companies laying off and do the same
[4:52:08] Se7enthSinn: at the time you dont know that you dont need them
[4:52:19] y0rge: you cut expenses you cut noneeded work force
[4:52:34] Limdaer: Yeah Riot Forge and almost whole Legends of Runeterra
[4:52:38] y0rge: lol is no more expanding as 10 or 5 years aggo
[4:52:44] fwankey: hasSadge
[4:52:49] Sebleh: every single tech company overestimated how much they were expanding during covid. they saw growth and pushed for “return to office” policies which was literally the opposite of what provided their growth.
[4:52:57] StantonSC: a lot of companies hire expecting to lose people over time but jobs are tough and not enough people moved on to other jobs
[4:53:22] Srosh_: have they shut down the MMO project?
[4:53:27] Sebleh: I’m sad to see Riot Forge go because I was waiting for the League based Metroidvania game Sadge
[4:53:31] Sebleh: no @srosh_
[4:53:41] Deenial: Wasn't there a LoL fighter game too? Was that impacted?
[4:53:43] iStreamSunday: Yep basically when projected resources and actual requirements don’t match so “Johnson” in finance decides to axe a bunch of people, financial projections are typically very hard to
[4:53:57] MooniexVibes: yeah companies pushing for “return to office” are just goobers and behind the times. a lot of companies saw higher productivity with partial or total work from home.

[4:54:25] MooniexVibes: whew
[4:54:34] fwankey: Shruge
[4:54:54] Limdaer: They are working on it a long time now.. I dont think they shut it down.. not without telling us
[4:54:59] Srosh_: Greg isn’t working anymore, that’s for sure
[4:55:07] Srosh_: he started his own or so
[4:55:13] Sebleh: who knows dude. that’s just what they said. in the article where they announced the layoffs they gave status updates on all their games. they included Project L and said “development is going strong”
[4:55:40] Limdaer: @Sebleh project L is their fighting game, not the mmo
[4:55:49] Deenial: LMAO
[4:55:55] tea2468: there's a lot of reputable sources that could give more information about this topic
[4:56:53] Yoshjj: Is there a reliable way to see when you're in contention for the Rio achievement for end of season?
[4:56:57] Limdaer: I think the layoffs are partially so that they can fund the mmo
[4:57:14] cmnights: did they remove rise from dungeon pool yet?
[4:57:21] CoffeeCoffeeCoffeehouse: do you have a formal education for when things go sour? Like Fleischereifachverkäuferin oder something to that regard?

[5:16:39] angelxwind12: Goot the campfire! Woot woot!
[5:16:41] MaseratiPrime: You're an introvert :) Introverts need to recharge their social batteries by chilling on their own for a while.
[5:16:41] jonny_jink: I think its amazing how streamers that chat alot, like yourself and Preach, can do it so well and for so long. It's a real skill!

[5:17:10] gerryblue: I have great respect for ppl who work in hospitals I couldn't do it though
[5:17:22] Sebleh: So if a child acts out the parents just go "you deal with it. You're supposed to be caring for MY child and teaching him better" but bitch please you're the one raising the kid I'm just teaching them.
[5:17:26] Deenial: Teachers are one of those jobs where I imagine you have to be doing it cos you love it, cos the pay is nonexistant and the hours are awful. I'd literally rather fight oncoming traffic
[5:18:04] MaseratiPrime: Teachers have to work really hard outside of school hours.
[5:18:17] Sebleh: If you add up the post-work hours that teachers in the US spend working then they make about as much as a McDonalds cashier.
[5:18:37] Anterione: People nowadays are heavily against discipline, but then you go look into schools and its such chaos, misbehaving children everyone, teachers are bullied, its horrible
[5:18:37] NeoSmoke: There's tons of people that don't even properly greet you when you say hi to them. Some are even disrespectfull and see you as a slave that has to make serve them food. But it's great talking to the good, polite and respectfull customers.
[5:18:56] angelxwind12: Very true. All good points

[5:19:50] MaseratiPrime: American teachers have extra training in weapons expertise and guerilla tactics so they can deal with the active shooters coming to their campus every week.
[5:19:50] scream_cha: teachers in Belarus earn close to nothing and are forced to do so many buereucracy
[5:20:31] angelxwind12: Specially when they do it on purpose
[5:21:05] Rylexteo: Never be rude to the people that are cooking or serving your food.
[5:21:28] Adalinadraenor: You could be a virtual assistent then
[5:21:51] Sebleh: The logic is the server didn't listen to your order so they made you the wrong thing but in restaurants there's usually multiple checks to prevent that.
[5:22:04] Sebleh: but I get it. I do agree it's awful.
[5:22:06] LoLOkanak: welcome to ny :D
[5:22:11] MissSpank: I had a college professor tell me I was a failure for Holding a 105% in his class.  Reason I didn't get my scholarship to a top engineering school.

[5:22:51] Rylexteo: Whoever coined the phrase "The customer is always right." I want to slap with a tuna
[5:23:00] Sebleh: I once got to do a "let me talk to the manager" "BITCH I AM THE MANAGER" PepeLaugh it was great.
[5:23:12] Deenial: lmao the second I hear the line "the customer is always right" whether it comes from the customers or management, my eyes roll to the back of my head
[5:23:23] MaxGrandpre: Good morning yall
[5:23:50] MaseratiPrime: @DeenialVT That line is from a JC Penney advertisement from like 1928 or something.
[5:23:55] Rylexteo: @Sebleh Whats better is the "I want to speak with your manager!" *Walk into the back room, take off jacket covering the manager nametag and walk back out* "What can I do for you?"

[5:24:08] NeoSmoke: oh yeah I get attention seekers every week. And every week they ask me the same questions. So frustrating but after a while you start laughing inside
[5:24:40] MaxGrandpre: Makes me think, our healer got blamed in a Tott last night because the hunter got 1 shot (targetted by 2 abilities) and he didn't use any defensives CDs. My healer friend was feeling really bad, but we reviewed the video together to show him it wasn't his fault
[5:24:47] MaxGrandpre: People are the worst
[5:25:38] gerryblue: some ppl are just mad all the time
[5:25:39] Deenial: LMAOOOO

[5:26:38] angelxwind12: Can't argue with that logic haha
[5:27:03] Sebleh: Excuse you?

[5:35:48] asurrraaa: I do think there’s a difference between what you experience and what other experience cause I will probably get told negative things personally but maybe 20 or 30 people a day but you’re looking at hundreds of people a day so of course, from a contact creators point of view it’s very different from a typical day-to-day person
[5:35:51] Sebleh: No you're right it was 2022 @BizBichou
[5:36:06] Faramonde: Like raiding with Myst?

[5:36:13] BizBichou: @Sebleh i take it back i have perfect concept of time

[5:38:37] Sebleh: Because we have 10 seasonals (including the Legion TW affix) and 10 DF dungeons if you split DOTI in 2.
[5:38:40] AdryenGaming: It would become significantly less interesting with no affixes. But some affixes definitely need a review

[5:39:05] Fi9e: then do affixes for +21-+30 Kappa

[5:39:59] Sebleh: seblehPhone @Kuroz I have a very relevant question
[5:40:21] Iliiliiliill: Thats why I never do my own high key on a wednessday
[5:40:23] asurrraaa: @stracktion I think she meant that in a comedic funny way lol.
[5:40:23] Sebleh: seblehPhone Is it true that most regions of Italy have their own regional style of lasagna?
[5:40:30] Kuroz: seblehHmm
[5:40:41] radiera: yes but the adjustemnt is small
[5:40:43] Piratuga: what about a "build your own key", where you get to choose the affixes in your key before starting from a deck of random options
[5:40:49] radiera: you can adjust to it in 1 day max
[5:40:52] TiPera: affixes are necessary imo but they need to be complete re done. I think if they remove them completely more people would try to push high keys in a early state but after a few weeks they would get bored and less people would be in the m+ scene I feel like
[5:40:54] Sebleh: seblehPhone seblehHmm
[5:41:07] Spartany25: so blizz uses weekly copium to keep us sucked in?
[5:41:24] Kuroz: seblehHmm  false. @Sebleh
[5:41:53] Sebleh: seblehPhone That's unfortunate @Kuroz .
[5:41:58] Xavara_MG: If they took affixes out I think they would make dungeons more difficult when designing them and people would complain about that then

[5:42:11] wuskyfox: how is it different from diablo-like games tho?

[5:42:39] AdryenGaming: QQ, why do you double cast starfall on AoE? I thought itt only refreshes and adds the time when < 5s or so?  Feel like my own balance dps is lower than it should be and the biggest difference is im only refreshing starfall in that range rather than essentially spending my AP on it
[5:42:47] radiera: no no , i agree , we need affixes but... change them more offten , so that point of adaptation is harder toa chive
[5:42:54] crunchy93: tyrannical and fortified suck, i think the dungeons would be fine if they just scaled health/damage without those
[5:42:56] MaseratiPrime: @Naguura what are your ideas for some new or reworked m+ affixes?
[5:43:06] Sebleh: @AdryenGaming They changed so it stacks
[5:43:19] BizBichou: @AdryenGaming starfall stacks, doesn't refresh
[5:43:24] AdryenGaming: Wait hold up, so multiple starfalls stack?
[5:43:25] Sebleh: @AdryenGaming starfall stacks every time you cast it and each cast has it's own timer (doesn't refresh when you add a new one)

[5:46:20] pedraodc: hey @Naguura why u dont use the toxic boots anymore?
[5:46:23] crunchy93: it just feels like they can be so creative with m+ but they are stuck in a design philosophy that is 4 expansions old at this point
[5:46:48] itsClubby: I mean we could argue that farm content is repeatable right?
[5:46:52] MissSpank: I wish m+ was all the new dungeons each week and each season some are added along the current ones from each expansion.
[5:46:56] ShelviJ: fated raid?
[5:46:57] Spartany25: raiding can be repeatable if u care about parsing
[5:47:07] NerdDEX: like running the same Heroic instances for 10 years?
[5:47:14] Andersonmps: Damn. Boomkin makes everything seem like it hurts a lot
[5:47:16] AdryenGaming: technically though _most_ of your keys you will run would be "farm" content. As you're not pushing keys every key
[5:47:18] Lenietwitch: @Spartany25 parsing is not part of the game though
[5:47:33] stracktion: odd how a huge % of players repeatedly clear a raid several times a day for gold then o.O
[5:47:39] Lenietwitch: raid is not repeatble content by the terms of the game, parsing is not a game mechanic, so it doesnt count imo
[5:47:47] BizBichou: @stracktion not mythic though HUH
[5:48:01] itsClubby: anniesSmug we wouldn't do that
[5:48:15] Tenivir: monkaHmm

[5:49:37] itsClubby: Now the real question, is TFT repeatable?>
[5:49:44] yung_lingling: if wow announced it’s no longer making new content after the war soul series, what game would you turn to?
[5:49:46] Sebleh: The way I see it with no affix M+ is like CMs where most people did their CM dungeons and dropped it and only the super sweats kept going for sales or better times etc
[5:49:54] Artresis_: Tft rng is mostly shops/items tho
[5:49:58] Draznath: raids with affix's when YEP
[5:50:09] BizBichou: speaking of TFT i wonder if the new battle pass is out today NOTED
[5:50:11] ShelviJ: real pvp in wow = dps damage meters
[5:50:16] minarazero: do you think they should bring back M+ equipment change from Legion?
[5:50:24] BizBichou: @Draznath you're one expansion late, we had it in SL
[5:50:55] Draznath: yeah i know fated raiding season, but a timed raid with weekly affixes could be fun if it was tuned correctly
[5:50:56] Darn_94: want to get back into retail, havent played since first raid DF. what class would you recommend to pick up as dps?
[5:51:13] stracktion: downside of m+ is the whole competetive side of it though. fine it is repeatable. but we have also created a agressive side to pve due to the timer and making it a competetive setting where you win money irl if you time a high key. all that create is agressive and rush attitude to every other dungeon aswell :/
[5:51:23] TiPera: run while u can monkaS @Darn_94
[5:51:28] stormyweatherr: @stracktion thats the fun part tho
[5:51:39] asurrraaa: Ya think healers have the hardest role in MMO ? I think WoW makes it harder since we also have to dispel adds on affixes but in FFXIV we pretty much heal and damage but WoW takes healing to another level 😂
[5:51:43] MaxGrandpre: @Darn_94 depends on what you like, but BM hunters are really easy to pick up and have a real good dps. Otherwise, I would say to just find something you like
[5:51:47] throwmasterlol: @Darn_94 go moonkin or noob
[5:51:50] Sebleh: @Draznath No. Raiding is already kinda rough with how many other brains you have to deal with. Making it with affixes would be awful. Affixes work because it's in a small group.
[5:51:50] AdryenGaming: I think personally the affixes are too focused on mechanical changes ( if you don't interrupt this you do 50% less healing/damage etc) rather than things that change up the actual dungeon.   I think the affixes like those in BFA like the obelisks and the 4 mobs were FAR more interesting than stuff like incorporeal
[5:51:51] BizBichou: @stracktion competitiveness is the best part of it though

[5:53:02] sim967: @darn_94 both of those are good in dungeons
[5:53:09] asurrraaa: im new to WoW , about 3 weeks. and the most fun I’ve had has been M+. I love the affixes and how it fucks you up 😂
[5:53:13] BizBichou: awakened was the best affix and i miss it every day angy

[5:53:43] asurrraaa: I love Tyrannical.
[5:53:45] Draznath: long boss fights and 1 shot mechanics make tyrannical
[5:53:45] drewj_el: they think its worse cause you can die and run back
[5:53:46] Schlagergott: wich incoporeal wa is this ?
[5:53:50] akkawow666: because boss is longer then raid end boss
[5:53:50] drewj_el: cant*
[5:53:51] asurrraaa: I think people hate it is because of boss mechanics.
[5:54:09] mixj1: boss got so much hp and makes it harder
[5:54:13] XytrezTV: @dalgress nightelf have vanish as racial
[5:54:13] Sebleh: yeah bosses become 7 minute health sponge fights with 3 mechanics so it’s kinda boring because of how long it drags out
[5:54:17] itsClubby: I feel like the general opinion is Tyran should give a boss a new mechanic?
[5:54:23] throwmasterlol: its possible to hate your way through the trash, and the timers are so chill. but the bosses might be a hard wall
[5:54:25] dalgress: cries in troll druid
[5:54:28] akkawow666: they are same but you fight them 8 minutes
[5:54:29] bound006: just think of the worm boss from s1 on tyrannical Bedge
[5:54:29] itsClubby: rather than give it health
[5:54:32] Aldemortt: tyrannical is the most punishing, on fortified pulls dont last 6 minutes, in a long boss fight if u wpe at 6m the punish is inmense
[5:54:37] stracktion: @stormyweatherr we get more and more angry people and thats the downside of the whole m+ system. atleast we get solo stuff next expancion and that might solve stuff. but a heavy ban hammer is also handy to make the game better and accesable for everyone who wants to enjoy the game
[5:54:41] MaseratiPrime: The trash is fun though
[5:54:45] AdryenGaming: M+ talents and playstyle are more suited to group pulls, bosses mostly are not grouped and therefore a lot of builds aren't suited to it. I think tyrannical becomes a problem as it takes the part of the dungeon you don't optimise for and extends it.
[5:54:47] MaseratiPrime: aoe dps = fun
[5:54:49] Schlagergott: !wa

[5:54:52] MaseratiPrime: st dps = lame
[5:54:52] matt_xiv: because boss fights are boring and easy usually
[5:54:56] itsClubby: People also love aoe damage
[5:55:00] Admiller0: its worse for tyran because deaths = wipe where as fortified you can run back thus saving time @Naguura
[5:55:01] AdryenGaming: You can then change it to optimise for the bosses, but then the trash you're slower on.
[5:55:04] sim967: honestly, it’s easier to time on tyran
[5:55:05] zoidflerk: what's the meeting of the day about hmmMeeting
[5:55:06] crunchy93: tyrannical should just make bosses do more damage, fighting a boss for 5 minutes doing the same 2-3 mechanics over and over is mad boring
[5:55:13] Artresis_: Bosses being 5min long instead of 3min feels worse than a pack living 1minute instead of 45s
[5:55:14] AdryenGaming: so you can mix group comp to have 2x aoe dps and 1 ST
[5:55:14] soderCS: the thing i think makes tyrannical bad is because if you fail a boss, key is pretty much a fail
[5:55:18] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:55:21] MissSpank: Also who doesn't like big aoe pulls where the mobs don't die super fast
[5:55:47] crunchy93: this is why i like the mega dungeons because at least the bosses there are more interesting so a longer fight doesnt bother me as much
[5:56:02] BizBichou: @stracktion people are equally angry in pug raids Shruge it's not the downside of m+, it's the downside of playing with randoms in any content
[5:56:09] Aldemortt: what if tyrannical only affects one boss? like one of the bosses in the dungeons is mega evolved?
[5:56:14] kemephis: kemephis subscribed with Prime.

[5:56:38] Deenial: "Has to be not annoying and somewhat interesting" Naguura talking about affixes the way I scroll through Tinder Deadge
[5:56:51] mayonaes: They need affixes that alter boss abilities and enhance them so strategies change.
[5:57:18] bound006: @deenialvt Aware
[5:57:33] Spartany25: none of that bothers me as much as norm damage one shotting a handful of classes
[5:57:50] crunchy93: i think getting rid of seasonal affixes altogether was a mistake too. they should have worked to make them more fun rather than just removing them
[5:58:04] Artresis_: I think people wouldnt mind bosses on tyranical if they were easier. No one hates tyranical because of rezan/first boss BRH . They hate it because of yazma/xavius/rise
[5:58:07] Lenietwitch: also like m+ bosses are suuuuuuper boring in general, 1,2 mechanics for 5 minutes is not engaging at all, i agree 100%
[5:58:14] Morethus: HeyGuys
[5:58:27] matt_xiv: we just dislike boring boss fights
[5:58:46] Lenietwitch: is like on fort is ok, because they last just enough, but on tyranical is like hitting a dummy

[5:59:28] Draznath: i think they could delete both tyrannical and fort, and come up with something new. maybe bring back the seasonal affixes
[6:00:02] AdryenGaming: And then all the spiders stand in the blood pools
[6:00:06] itsClubby: yeah if that was Tyran that'd be great
[6:00:14] Artresis_: If they added thst people would mass quit m+
[6:00:18] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:02:07] Draznath: delete tryannical and fort, bring back seasonal affix in its place as the default affix, then tune the dungeons to take into account no tryn/fort
[6:02:11] AdryenGaming: How long has it been since they changed it to only being able to shoot 2x arcane pulsar from 3? The timing is so weird because im use to 3 and constantly get the "no astral power"
[6:02:13] faulen: I just want affixes that Warriors can help with. I feel usless for the last 2 weeks
[6:02:20] Artheeri: sanguine depths was a vibe with quaking on the last boss
[6:02:40] BizBichou: i have fond memories of getting sucked back to the platform on last boss in de other side and just dying to quaking wildigFeelsStrongMan
[6:02:45] Sooshi876: get rid of incorp and afflicted
[6:02:46] MaseratiPrime: I still think there's some mileage to bringing back seasonal affixes as weekly affixes.
[6:02:50] Sebleh: ah yes bricking a Nokhud on the last boss because quaking went off as the boss force stacked your group was great gameplay
[6:03:29] MissSpank: Also no one wants to go into a dungeon to do progression on a boss in a timed run
[6:03:48] jrs9794: have bosses do more AOE one week and more ST on others
[6:03:56] AdryenGaming: No authenticator Naguura? Tsk tsk
[6:04:13] faulen: Something that Warriors can help with would be nice.

[6:05:42] MaxGrandpre: yea it's instant
[6:05:55] Admiller0: true but afflicted is restricted to less specs vs incorp
[6:06:00] AdryenGaming: one is SO much more punishing though, losing 50% damage and healing is an insane debuff when two spawn at once. In a mediocre group, one goes off too much
[6:06:17] miiloevan: aff can not be done by all players
[6:06:23] NR_Noxx_Rev: This knife in the mouth, I panic
[6:06:35] Gaijinss: Gaijinss subscribed with Prime. 
[6:06:39] asurrraaa: as a holy priest I take care of afflicted sooo easy. it was actually super fun keeping an eye out for them
[6:06:40] BizBichou: hunter trap OP, instant cast and i can cast it when the incorporeal is spawning wildigGasm
[6:06:50] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[6:07:06] Aldemortt: druid is the only class that can  do all affixs?
[6:07:12] faulen: warriors feel usless most weeks
[6:07:13] Sebleh: the problem I have with afflicted is that it’s not hard but sometimes if someone CCs the one you’re casting on then your spell will just not finish casting and people get so thrown off by that. there is no good indication that someone else cancelled your cast
[6:07:23] AdryenGaming: I think you need to have dps be able to handle an affix and then either healer or tank
[6:07:25] Xenomshox: dh and wars w/ their 50% less heal
[6:07:40] MaseratiPrime: @asurrraaa But not everyone can handle that affix. Incorporeal anyone but warrior can do.
[6:07:41] AdryenGaming: Monk?
[6:07:43] mixj1: we can
[6:07:43] throwmasterlol: shadow prolly

[6:10:19] sim967: no idea
[6:10:22] Aveziele: hero classes might give something new to the game tho @Naguura
[6:10:23] Sebleh: I don’t think so
[6:10:28] itsClubby: I mean now they've gone full into it I hope they just keep bringing more
[6:10:29] Lennerrt: wasn't a new class kinda speculated?
[6:10:34] Vile_: hero talents??

[6:10:38] Aldemortt: o u mean overall, i though u was talking about druids
[6:10:44] Hades1228: Third Demon Hunter spec would be nice.
[6:10:46] rawmanc3: aug is not getting invited in most keys with pugs
[6:10:50] rawmanc3: aug is for teams mostly
[6:11:04] MaseratiPrime: I just don't want them to rework any currently existing specs into support classes.
[6:11:07] f_tier: tru
[6:11:08] Aldemortt: the new dwarfs only i believe
[6:11:08] Vile_: we’re not getting a new class or spec, we’re getting hero talents and Blizz is gonna have a terrible time trying to balance them and keep them fun as well.
[6:11:08] AdryenGaming: I mean, it did really didn't it? Nearly all top keys have an aug and they were a must have for raids?
[6:11:15] Bourrel: they didnt for dragonflight
[6:11:34] OldManDave101: but they didnt anounced it for dragonflight ether
[6:11:41] itsClubby: In my head we were worried about adding more specs/class into the game would impact balance, but at this point do you thinlk they're passed the line and they should just add more and more specs/classes now?
[6:11:55] Megadisaster24: They did announce evokers
[6:11:57] OldManDave101: evokers, but not the augmentation
[6:11:58] reggiepowa: they did
[6:11:59] Bourrel: aug evoker
[6:12:02] itsClubby: they didnt announce their new spec but yeah announced the class
[6:12:02] Megadisaster24: but only 2 specs
[6:12:02] Sebleh: no they did we knew evoker a were coming
[6:12:05] Sebleh: they didn’t announce Aug
[6:12:11] Spartany25: think we need less specs instead of more. tuning around 38 specs has got to be a nightmare
[6:12:11] k4noha: This woman with knife Kreygasm
[6:12:22] k_c_wolf: @rawmanc3 your augs aren’t getting invited to pugs? I’ve pugged mine to 2900
[6:12:28] Sebleh: we typically never get new classes two expacs in a row tho
[6:12:35] itsClubby: They say a lot of things
[6:12:38] Draznath: Aug master race EZ Clap
[6:12:46] itsClubby: I'm waiting for Bronze Mage
[6:12:46] f_tier: i hope aug gets reworked into a melee spec or something
[6:12:47] TotallyNotRaien: do they even consider aug a support spec?
[6:12:47] Sebleh: but if they can shadow drop a spec then who’s to say we don’t get 3rd dh spec mid tww
