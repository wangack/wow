[1:15:05] Thdlock: @theitalianstallion321, next week is really bad for tank becuase its necrotic / emissary of the tides so the mobs will run u down if u dont kill em quick
[1:15:56] zaraine1: 70 min depths? yikes

[1:16:21] TheItalianStallion321: @Thdlock congrats on World 1st by the way, good shit
[1:16:40] gorilla_quantistico: @Towelliee if you look at raider io the most used tank in high ranks after dh is bear
[1:16:42] Irrevocable2: how are you doing so much dps? WTH! Are you swapping legendary for M+?
[1:16:47] SmokedHog: I can't do higher than a 7. seems like the jump from 6 to 7 really sucks
[1:16:49] gorilla_quantistico: in keys
[1:17:03] Kleva1: I watched sloot do a 15 on his druid and everyone elses alts. It was rough to watch

[1:18:01] infektyd: his druid was 196 ilevel, he said very undergeared for that level
[1:18:12] SmokedHog: if you did have a kyrian they should have woke up the goliath
[1:18:52] peywon123: transmog ur new 1800 rating mog :D

[1:19:52] Strindgard: Is there still a problem with prot paladins taking alot of damage? (some wierd mitigation)
[1:20:11] CritcobainTV: Prot feels squishy to me in m+
[1:20:24] bosseja: agree
[1:20:27] plumpus81: Why do you say disappointing?
[1:20:30] MuttonChopins: loot is a bit disappointing
[1:20:31] gorilla_quantistico: mixed feelings
[1:20:34] CritcobainTV: But mines venthyr, and ik kyrian is good for prot for mythics
[1:20:36] Masqerader: one day my Kyrian mission tables will be a success
[1:20:36] ThiCCboiyG: great for pvp not really for pve probs
[1:20:38] Aervyper: @Towelliee you think raiding is gonna get nerfed this week?
[1:20:38] Voidheim: I think its a little disappointing to only a small group of overall players.
[1:20:40] Thadune: @Towelliee My biggest disappointing is busting my ass in a M+ just to get 35 anima..
[1:20:42] zaraine1: for some reason i cant get into groups for DoS and Mists
[1:20:45] plumpus81: Agreed
[1:20:50] jeneraljelly: Do you think there should be more loot then?
[1:20:52] CritcobainTV: Wait, did nobody grab the anima orb?
[1:20:57] TweakT: it feels great if you're a casual
[1:20:59] swordwindgaming: m+ for tanking is bonkers, the best strat is to avoid tanking
[1:21:03] Masqerader: @Towelliee and those kyrian mission tables compared to night fae /sigh that too
[1:21:06] SmokedHog: you know it's bad when I've had to run HoA about 50 times on mythic and still haven't gotten the chest piece
[1:21:08] swordwindgaming: it does feel great if you're a casual
[1:21:08] Pahdunkadunk: but thats not the whole expansion
[1:21:14] Cru3: Feels great for me
[1:21:18] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee this xpac is amazing so far
[1:21:19] gorilla_quantistico: necrotc wake has the worst trash in the game

[1:21:22] Cru3: Lovin it
[1:21:28] Akoudadis: @Towelliee for some reason feels like ANTHEM at the moment bro
[1:21:32] wild_corndogs: I personally find it disapointing based on loot, when I seen the hours i put in and the MUCH less my guildmates had and yet they left the week with a higher ilevel... discouraging to see over and over
[1:21:45] Luquatic: loot is fine
[1:21:47] jeneraljelly: It
[1:21:47] Effin_Steffin: Gloria!
[1:21:48] SmokedHog: I've literally been farming HoA non stop and never get the chest piece. it's becoming a mailmuncher meme at this point
[1:21:56] tawney_owl_: @gorilla_quantistico Necrotic wake is genuinley one of my least favorite dungeons of all time
[1:22:01] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:22:04] swordwindgaming: truthfully, I only resubbed this month because I don't want to fall behind on soul ash
[1:22:21] tawney_owl_: the trash is too goddamn stressful
[1:22:34] Brandonhipster: @Thadune yeah was watching a streamer raid and they killed 5 bosses and he got nothing but 35 anima. At least make it more anima
[1:22:37] wild_corndogs: @swordwindgaming I have given up the grind honestly. I am just over it.
[1:23:05] SmokedHog: mythic bosses need to drop 1k anima or soul ash if no gear drops

[1:23:14] sinlesssinner: Legendaries arent a grind, there is one good one u need to have then u chill lol
[1:23:23] gorilla_quantistico: @tawney_owl_ ye when you do at m0 seems the easiest but until you hit kinda decent keys it becomes a nightmare
[1:23:41] sinlesssinner: its not like u need to have 3 legendaries crafted, there is a BiS, you make it and wait for nerfs/buffs
[1:23:43] raldrik: that was a butt clencher
[1:23:43] garmin1987: mage is pumping
[1:23:45] tawney_owl_: @critcobain At least its linear, in necro the trash just feels like rng at a certain point
[1:23:58] Kromede: just blow it
[1:24:09] CritcobainTV: nah, NW isn't even bad, u have so many items to deal with it, u just need people to kick

[1:44:33] TheFabilolz: @kromede horde or alliance ?
[1:44:33] dergNwolf: I don't get why we didn't get a Valor Point vendor back for pve
[1:44:38] Affiiance: I will say Im loving PvPing right now

[1:45:46] Marduk_zth: bubble taunt u won't regret it
[1:45:47] Vowels_tv: mythic is still better
[1:45:50] sharie: screw pvp man
[1:45:55] ExtreemeCheese: How can you call pvp the best way to gear though? You can only buy a few pieces right now
[1:45:57] Affiiance: For the PVE mains thats the case, but I understand the PvP mains who have felt screwed over by gearing for a long time
[1:46:00] TheFabilolz: @kromede i mean im struggling as an outlaw rogue 194 ilvl to do a decent key so...
[1:46:03] peywon123: No
[1:46:05] dergNwolf: I think it's good thing is a pvp vendor. The BAD thing is there is no pve vendor like in BC/WotLK
[1:46:05] peywon123: thats not true
[1:46:06] TyThompson: @Towelliee not true, you need to maintain within 30 rating
[1:46:06] sinlesssinner: u gotta keep that rating
[1:46:07] Aro725: its only for that week
[1:46:11] peywon123: u need to stay above iut
[1:46:13] thebakeriscomingforu: I think pve just needs fixed.
[1:46:14] mabrno: lol are you retarded
[1:46:19] Subparferal: why??? try getting to 2400+ lol
[1:46:21] Wcvechten: ye, you shoud have a reason to stay on your rating
[1:46:25] mmrghost7: mythic is trash compare to pvp
[1:46:25] northcub: I have no need for Verc gear
[1:46:25] sinlesssinner: u get 3 loots from dungs + 3 from raids
[1:46:27] Scoodles91: its 1 piece a week from conquest, tops
[1:46:27] Kromede: TheFabilolz i play only solo sorry FeelsBadMan
[1:46:27] JeemTeam: its broken, bottomline
[1:46:32] peywon123: U need to stay above the rating!!!
[1:46:32] SublimedRocket2: way harder to get 2000+ than to get heroic
[1:46:34] Aro725: if you get 1800 and then drop to 1700 next week youll need to get 1800 back to get 220
[1:46:35] peywon123: read chat
[1:46:36] sinlesssinner: same with VAULT?
[1:46:36] Aegrial: yah nerf pvp gear droprates.
[1:46:36] Vowels_tv: it takes 5 weeks to get all the pvp gear anyway
[1:46:42] Vowels_tv: and thats assuming everything is BIS in pvp
[1:46:43] TheAckk: how many people you think can really get 1800?
[1:46:44] Subparferal: arenas is harder than pve lol
[1:46:47] itouzumaki: Hahaha bro you are just mad you can’t get rated pvp
[1:46:51] KonradGM: try pugging the arenas
[1:46:51] sinlesssinner: dude u telling me u didnt get a piece of loot in ALL RAIDS and dungeons u did?
[1:46:52] gorilla_quantistico: the sole fact you can target the slot is op
[1:46:54] Vowels_tv: and 1800 is hard.....u get carried man
[1:46:58] itouzumaki: The. Do it
[1:47:01] FenrirTheUnbound: you play prot paladin in arenas tho
[1:47:02] sinlesssinner: cmon man, its 2 pieces of loot max from pvp alone
[1:47:03] nephttv_: Arena is not difficult when all you need really is 1800 cr
[1:47:05] swordwindgaming: 1600 rating PogChamp
[1:47:09] sinlesssinner: its not broken
[1:47:11] Voidheim: cries at not being able to break 1200 raiting
[1:47:16] JeemTeam: when i would rather pvp since i can determine when i get my gear, versus pve when i could run shit all week and not get anything relevant

[1:47:21] itouzumaki: Lol if it’s so easy and better you should do it
[1:47:23] Subparferal: if you pvp you wait for 1800 cap for th weapon the fuck
[1:47:27] Aro725: 1800 is def hard when you dont go prot boomkin lmao
[1:47:27] Aegrial: working as intended
[1:47:28] Lazugo: and im a sucker in pvp lol
[1:47:28] feherlofia123: i heard people saying 1500 is equivalent to 2000 rating in bfa
[1:47:33] jerexify: I can absolutely NOT reach 1600... I'm god-awful.
[1:47:35] feherlofia123: u gotts earn it
[1:47:40] sinlesssinner: nothing is going to change about pvp man lol
[1:47:41] MuttonChopins: M+ you dont get much gear in RAids you get very little loot drops @sinlesssinner
[1:47:44] Lazugo: pvp is the better to get gear right now
[1:47:45] Vowels_tv: give it a few more weeks there will bne so much more gear in the world tro be traded around
[1:47:47] Affiiance: I dunno I like the gearing system right now
[1:47:47] FenrirTheUnbound: ONWARDS TO ADVENTUREEE
[1:47:49] Vowels_tv: and this hot topic will fade
[1:47:51] Yagr6: but its all vers gear
[1:47:54] itouzumaki: It’s funny you say it’s easy but yet you are grinding m+
[1:47:54] Yagr6: who wants vers
[1:48:02] thebakeriscomingforu: Blizz needs to bring back some of the tools of raids past to help. Bring back "Badges" and vendors to help out
[1:48:04] nephttv_: @Raijuu88 outlaw
[1:48:05] thebakeriscomingforu: Something
[1:48:05] SublimedRocket2: 1800 is harder than 10/10 heroic
[1:48:05] Affiiance: As a Monk I love Vers lol
[1:48:09] sinlesssinner: @TacoVendor93 i am saying he does all that content, and he is not getting ONE piece of gear :p
[1:48:11] Tensei_c: did reset happen yet in NA?
[1:48:11] byrdeen45: Like doing 10 mythic + and not getting a single drop its sad
[1:48:13] dergNwolf: @pro_ta_to which drops 210 at most at +15 KEKW
[1:48:14] Clicklesly: Isn't it better to lust here anyway rather than last boss?
[1:48:16] Technogre: some people don't like to or can't mythic raid
[1:48:17] feherlofia123: will people stop doing m+ in a few weeks ?
[1:48:18] JeemTeam: ya quite a few classes love vers
[1:48:21] dcorey416: I hate doing mythics and getting anima and no loot
[1:48:23] TyThompson: @Towelliee show us your pvp skilly skills
[1:48:30] Vowels_tv: wanting more gear is not a game flaw...its a designed incentive to play more. you've been unlucky. i got 4 pieces in heroic last week on mage in 1 run and no trades.
[1:48:31] sinlesssinner: @TacoVendor93 tahts heroic castle, mythic castle, and mythic dungs...and VAULT
[1:48:34] Kromede: towelliee can we have this song playing? original wow song, so no dmca https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjZeQaGesVw :)

[1:48:49] itouzumaki: @werenwolf exactly why are you wasting your time when you know pvp is better this guys not making any sense
[1:49:02] Scoodles91: last expansion it was the otherway around
[1:49:03] sinlesssinner: they are adding more options to their vault man lol @Towelliee why is that so bad
[1:49:06] Aro725: thats not a problem, 2100 is hard AF to get
[1:49:07] Affiiance: Why? PvPers had to do PVE content in previous expansions
[1:49:12] Snabido: @pissedmidgt PJSalt
[1:49:15] JeemTeam: because it wont stay like this and he likes pve more than pvp
[1:49:18] Mahal_11532: a 15 is 210, you can already upgrade it past there
[1:49:20] HAMMERRAZOR: hey @towelliee hey chat how are we all?
[1:49:22] cptrogers123: it needs to be nerfed man
[1:49:23] itouzumaki: It’s not a problem lol pvp is end game content
[1:49:25] byrdeen45: 235 is the top gear item isnt it
[1:49:26] sinlesssinner: remember in BFA when ppl have to pve for their gear in order to pvp? and that was ok ?
[1:49:27] Jarless: still not sure why thats an issue?
[1:49:27] Subparferal: I'm not salty @Snabido pvers are heh
[1:49:30] D3m0nHunt3r666: Nice system blizz Kappa
[1:49:30] Aro725: if they change this ill be so mad. finally good pvp gear and people still bitch
[1:49:31] dergNwolf: @pro_ta_to your argumentation doesn't .-.
[1:49:33] Vowels_tv: oph fuckkkk....that will 100% be broken. the honor gear at 200....is OP
[1:49:35] LilChiliMPH: I swear twitch/Coke need to fix the damn Coke energy commercial it's so damn loud!
[1:49:35] wattyyyyyy: Pvpers always have to do pve stop malding boomer
[1:49:36] bookooti: True
[1:49:37] FenrirTheUnbound: I see pve players buying boes and doing dailies not pvp
[1:49:41] dergNwolf: they shouldn't change anything about pvp
[1:49:42] Mahal_11532: Glad only gets you the Myhic Denathrius ilvl weapon
[1:49:46] dergNwolf: they should do something about pve
[1:49:47] peywon123: Listen! Lets say u get 1800 rating in arena - You need to stay above that to keep upgrading ur gear! If u drop below 1800 u can only upgrade to 213 gear
[1:49:52] Dyriks: my monk will love that pvp gear

[1:49:53] Kromede: pvp BabyRage
[1:49:54] itouzumaki: You aren’t even rated tho
[1:49:56] dergNwolf: if pvp is in a good spot, it's in a good spot
[1:49:56] TyThompson: @Towelliee yea we are mad, we have been screwed over several expansions
[1:49:57] itsbananas01: BabyRage
[1:49:58] MrGattz: its so broken
[1:50:01] Jarless: then up the pve gearing
[1:50:01] BurtMacklin410: uh oh that guy called you a "malding boomer"
[1:50:02] dergNwolf: but pve is in a bad spot
[1:50:03] MrGattz: its not even fun its so bad
[1:50:03] SpoonManes: easiest way to get gear score up?
[1:50:07] swordwindgaming: I don't want to arena, I don't want to chase pillar humpers for hours on end. But that seems to be the way to gear right now.
[1:50:08] dergNwolf: please give valor points back pls pls pls
[1:50:10] SSD511_: Only if you need to get 233 wep go glad for me I’m cool with 2100
[1:50:11] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee we agree, but its broken everywhere lol
[1:50:12] PoKaDoT: Best pvp expansion since mop, actually enjoyable for once
[1:50:14] bookooti: but its hard for most people to get 1400 for most people but ya mythic raiding and dungeons need to be balanced for sure.
[1:50:14] Subparferal: it has never been balanced :/
[1:50:18] tinyhooters: MY GARBAGE CAN NEEDS GLAD Kappa
[1:50:19] thebakeriscomingforu: instead of nerfing pvp, i think buff pve.
[1:50:19] Affiiance: It wasnt balanced for PvPers before. PvE players are just dealing with it for the first time
[1:50:19] dozilla: When you say it's not balanced, specifically what do you mena??
[1:50:21] itouzumaki: You say it’s easy but you aren’t even rated
[1:50:24] Fensmarken: @wattyyyyyy and they always cry about/hate it - so why would you not have some insight and realise its bad if its the other way around aswell?
[1:50:24] byrdeen45: Bring back tokens
[1:50:28] Thadune: PVP can go fuck itself. Run 10+ mythics to just get 35 anima each run... Ya thats fucking "balanced"
[1:50:29] peywon123: Listen! Lets say u get 1800 rating in arena - You need to stay above that to keep upgrading ur gear! If u drop below 1800 u can only upgrade to 213 gear
[1:50:31] PoKaDoT: Pvp has always had to do pve to gear which is the same thing in reverse...
[1:50:33] Syllvn: I just thing they need a Titan Risedium style system in PVE
[1:50:42] Vowels_tv: They shouldnt nerf pvp gearing tho
[1:50:42] thebakeriscomingforu: Granted my view generally is to buff things not nerf everything to the ground
[1:50:46] Vowels_tv: they need to buff it all else
[1:50:46] itouzumaki: I’ve only heard you say this no one else actually
[1:50:51] TyThompson: I want to see @Towelliee pvp without getting carried
[1:51:08] Affiiance: Yeah its literally the exact same thing as before only now PvP is better
[1:51:12] GarfielfArbuncle: They can always bring back fucking badges.
[1:51:12] FenrirTheUnbound: @pro_ta_to same lol he just says "everyone high rated agrees" i've never heard this before
[1:51:19] gorilla_quantistico: pvp gearing has no problems imo they just need to buff other sources
[1:51:20] GarfielfArbuncle: You know, a system that worked for a decade./
[1:51:24] swordwindgaming: They will never bring back badges.
[1:51:24] feherlofia123: i heard venruki say the same thing , pvpers got the good end of the stick
[1:51:27] SSD511_: @peywon123 and you need to win one game at the highest rating you have
[1:51:38] GarfielfArbuncle: Gearing's going to be absolutely fucked until badges come back.
[1:51:38] Kalistraza: @Towelliee wtf? what happened to your head?!
[1:51:40] Aro725: thats how mythic plus was always before pvp gear
[1:51:55] Aro725: you could spam m plus to get loot and pvpers never got shit
[1:51:55] dergNwolf: so many mad people in chat KEKW
[1:51:57] PoKaDoT: Ans last few expansions it had been other way around and pvp players had to go do pve each week to get gear when they hate it
[1:51:57] DBMambo: it would take like 2 years to gear if that were the case
[1:51:58] Scoodles91: but then the cap would have been higher, and you would have got more piecec per week
[1:52:01] itouzumaki: I think they did it how they intended to do it lol
[1:52:03] swe_viking2: Y but most broken thing in pvp now is the burst dmg @towelliee
[1:52:08] MuttonChopins: A lot of players were advocating saying that PvP gearing was shit in BFA never heard anyone say PvP gearing inf BFA was great
[1:52:12] BoezIRL: hellooo towHAMUP
[1:52:19] Secondbreakfasttt: LMAO true
[1:52:24] Affiiance: PvE players still in shock from all the loot raining on them in BFA
[1:52:27] Syrion93: So True
[1:52:29] itouzumaki: It’s not tho
[1:52:32] itouzumaki: Haha
[1:52:36] Derran1on: @GarfielfArbuncle Did they implement this retarded random gearing instead of badges in pvp?
[1:52:37] nilachip: mald bois
[1:52:41] Aro725: Nope, PVErs finally mad cause they know how shitty it was for pvp to get loot before lmao
[1:52:48] fatpplareus: why should pvpers have to do pve to get good ilvl gear?
[1:52:49] Vowels_tv: actually fact. where was all the reverse crying when pvp gear was shit.....
[1:52:51] Dyriks: sweet
[1:52:54] northcub: I must be so bad at this game
[1:52:55] Subparferal: first xpac pvp is better than pve to gear and pvers are malding like crazy lol
[1:52:56] DingDongDean: Is it a bad thing the PvP'ers get some love for once though ?
[1:52:57] sinlesssinner: PLZ DO @Towelliee lets see how fast u gear up lol
[1:52:59] itouzumaki: I think you are the only one malding
[1:53:00] elchaposkjelbo: How are VDH atm?
[1:53:01] warrenny: Just increase loot again problem solved
[1:53:07] itouzumaki: Yep malding
[1:53:09] frankeyg: what is the problem with people gearing via pvp? this way anyone can gear up the way they enjoy the most
[1:53:09] TyThompson: @Towelliee good can't wait to see it
[1:53:10] feherlofia123: 1800 this expac equals 2400 in bfa tho
[1:53:15] GarfielfArbuncle: @Derran1on Nah, pvp atm is basically like the old badge system which is nice.
[1:53:17] dozilla: so PVP is being favored this expansion? not a problem in my eyes
[1:53:19] MuttonChopins: I've never heard a PvEr saying that PvP loot was great before, I always hear people agree that PvP loot was shit until now
[1:53:19] Mockle: @Affiiance getting 2 pieces of loot from 12 M+ runs right now is not right either
[1:53:20] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee i wanna see this in the works, you ll get 1 loot a week and 1 from vault lol
[1:53:23] Bammbino: Bammbino subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Keep up all the great work Towelliee!
[1:53:25] mmrghost7: whena pvper opens chest , and get a 233 wep out of it , and sign up to raid having no god damn idea that's when the problem starts

[1:53:28] Thadune: He just asking for balance... he isnt saying NERF PVP... is that so hard to understand?
[1:53:30] Mallaes: Upgrade? :D
[1:53:30] Aro725: no shot you get 1800 on ww without a carry in 3s
[1:53:33] bosseja: i think the will to play was grater on BFA launch
[1:53:35] GarfielfArbuncle: PVP needed help after how bad PVP gearing was in BFA.
[1:53:36] LordKain73: Suck it pvpers, your shits about to get nerfed KEKW
[1:53:36] sinlesssinner: so he just got loot?
[1:53:38] swordwindgaming: @DingDongDean Its an awful thing that one side of the game suffers at the expense of the other because it means the devs still don't know how to make both sides fun after XX years into the game
[1:53:41] garkhyt: stop it @Towelliee PVP'rs will start crying now LoL
[1:53:44] Yagr6: pvp is relevant now at least
[1:53:45] sinlesssinner: and he says no loot?
[1:53:47] Aegrial: nah
[1:53:49] Tensei_c: did reset happen yet in NA?
[1:53:51] kodtheog: Happy vault day !
[1:53:54] Aegrial: nerf pvp
[1:54:00] Affiiance: Yeah thats what PvPers asked for for years and we saw how that went
[1:54:04] Baron_Pandacula: buff pve, not nerf pvp
[1:54:09] swe_viking2: Towelliee most broken thing in pvp is burst dmg.
[1:54:12] Beave_86: pieces world 3rd
[1:54:12] GarfielfArbuncle: Don't nerf pvp, buff pve by bringing back badges.
[1:54:13] chaostheory8907: @sinlesssinner Bro chill, he didn’t literally mean no loot
[1:54:15] Mattsta: are servers going down at all today?
[1:54:24] Secondbreakfasttt: @sinlesssinner lmao you are delusional
[1:54:30] matamune26: m+ should give higher gear
[1:54:33] Scoodles91: you lose if you are low mmr\
[1:54:38] thebakeriscomingforu: If blizz doesn't want to have more loot drop then they need to bring back badges and vendors to help pve
[1:54:40] TweakT: Towleh I missed yo streams
[1:54:41] TyThompson: @Towelliee you do lose rating, you don't know what you're talking about
[1:54:44] sinlesssinner: @chaostheory8907 @qblayy how is that lol he keeps saying u dont gear as fast?
[1:54:44] Bedpan_BoB: so much baby rage
[1:54:55] Syrion93: I honestly think they should have kept the bonus loot tokens in the game. Would make more sense @Towelliee
[1:55:10] fatpplareus: but pvers like to pve tho, tahts the point, do what U LIKE to get good ilvl gear
[1:55:13] Mahal_11532: I have run like 30 keys this week and not gotten a single gear drop, so there is no equivalency
[1:55:14] CursingSatyr: @Towelliee They should bring back valor and PVE upgrade system it would balance things out
[1:55:16] Lazugo: Actually 12 -14 to get 207 ilv gear @Towelliee
[1:55:20] itouzumaki: Good m+ is boring same dungeons over and over again wtf
[1:55:21] Tyduss89: allow the same in pve to upgrade pve gear with a resource
[1:55:22] Attackroot: ya ive used pvp to fill in missing gear on my blood dk
[1:55:22] GarfielfArbuncle: Right in time.
[1:55:23] KonradGM: i would argue the 'easy' part, if you're meta spec then it's easier but you still need to get good partner
[1:55:31] Secondbreakfasttt: i wll say nothing if you could not understand the tpic sofar
[1:55:31] garroshdidnuthinwrong: so what people dont run m+ for years people didn't want to run arena hahaha
[1:55:31] ManoDeDiablo: @towelliee but the pvp gear stats are not that great
[1:55:33] pilhass10: @Towelliee pieces just killed last boss
[1:55:34] marcin008iha: On my hunter that I do M+ i have 205 gear and on my priest where i only pvp with 1800 rating my gear is 191. You serious?
[1:55:34] destroyerofantep: my beard grows like yours
[1:55:36] KonradGM: you start loosing rating for loses before 1400
[1:55:37] fallowing_deer: yes, but those honor upgrades comes in like 7 weeks
[1:55:38] Scoodles91: its mmr based, not rating based
[1:55:39] Affiiance: You lose rating as soon as you hit around 1300
[1:55:39] KonradGM: around 1350
[1:55:46] Affiiance: Yeah 1350 probably
[1:55:46] Gragnar: Gragnar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[1:55:48] PoKaDoT: I lost rating at 1200
[1:55:48] SSD511_: Waiting to unlock my 3 great vault 226 loot wish a wep
[1:55:52] TyThompson: play a game at 1400, lose on purpose... you lose rating
[1:55:52] LUKA_THIM: its so fun to go raid with a 25 man pug then dont get any loot
[1:55:55] Q_TheDreamer: you start losing rating at 1250
[1:55:55] MrGattz: the problem is that pvping shouldnt be the viable option to get gear for high end pveing
[1:56:01] LUKA_THIM: 3 loot and no bonus rolls fuck this
[1:56:03] Mockle: @pro_ta_to that's literally every content in wow
[1:56:06] Lazugo: Pieces world third
[1:56:07] itouzumaki: Haha you really don’t know about pvp sheesh I’m out
[1:56:10] FenrirTheUnbound: how do you not get loot but your ilvl is 206 people hit 2800 with 190 wdym
[1:56:11] GarfielfArbuncle: Remember Legion world pvp druid Kappa
[1:56:13] AureliusXV: why not?
[1:56:17] AlliAwesom3: prot pally is so broken that it's actually hilarious
[1:56:18] chaostheory8907: @pro_ta_to Thank god
[1:56:19] noteworthynerd: @pro_ta_to Mad KEKW
[1:56:23] kodtheog: Yeah they are pretty gross
[1:56:25] sinlesssinner: @qblayy calm down man :p its an ilvl thing i belive, most mythic raiders got used to being already 215+ and its slower now
[1:56:26] maximusjr: Its not hard to get to 2100, anyone can really.
[1:56:29] AureliusXV: high end pve was needed for high end pvp
[1:56:29] Shinji_Ex: new raid new expense they give you the gear free pretty much so you can raid idk
[1:56:34] MuttonChopins: tanks arent made to be in pvp imo
[1:56:45] gimmlay: isnt stats borked on pvp gear for pve
[1:56:47] Baron_Pandacula: 200% nani
[1:56:49] akia03: pieces killed sire?
[1:56:57] Lazugo: @diathi123 yep
[1:57:12] sinlesssinner: @gimmlay no? its vers on all gear, unless ur char wants vers then u dont need pvp gear at all
[1:57:12] kamisengames: kamisengames subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:57:16] Alzar_tv: @gimmlay Depends on your spec. RSham here and PvP gear is nearly BiS for most stuff bcuz Crit/Vers
[1:57:37] Vowels_tv: correction....its viable not OP
[1:57:44] gimmlay: @sinlesssinner that's what I'm saying
[1:57:54] KonradGM: with pvp it depends a lot on comp, when you're in hard meta you can pug your way to 1.8k if you're not, you gonna have miserable time in arenas
[1:58:02] gimmlay: as a BM I dont necessarily care about vers.
[1:58:03] Secondbreakfasttt: @sinlesssinner dude i'm calm. but saying that "he just got loot and saying there is no loot" just trolling. 1 example means nothing. killed 19 boses in raid and got 1 loot. so there is loot! like oke bro LUL
[1:58:05] Tyduss89: would you agree they should allow pve gear to be upgraded somehow lol
[1:58:06] sinlesssinner: @gimmlay well so u want pvp gear to go grey when u zone into a pve isntace? :p
[1:58:06] deschain_19: rounders pog
[1:58:13] GermanBacon: Sire, not generalls
[1:58:19] pilhass10: sire not generals
[1:58:25] mmrghost7: Bdks need more buffs , we are getting ovver aggroed by paladins
[1:58:31] Lazugo: Nono pieces just killed denathrius
[1:58:37] GermanBacon: and Pieces is now 10/10
[1:58:43] FoxyLauxy: FSY owns
[1:58:46] GarfielfArbuncle: @Towelliee They can get sponsored by Fatshark games Kappa
[1:58:48] GermanBacon: Towelliee is towDerp atm
[1:58:54] noteworthynerd: They don't want to do they?
[1:59:01] sinlesssinner: @qblayy i am still saying 1 piece of loot puts ya right next to the pvpers lol i am saying the minimum u could get from all the pve, gets ya one upgrade from drops, and one from vault. which is the max a pvper can get.
[1:59:09] Kromede: GermanBacon now? Kappa
[1:59:11] pereadin: Yeah strat development is where all the work is at
[1:59:16] SmokedHog: they basically state they follow all of limits strats lol
[1:59:19] GermanBacon: @Kromede true
[1:59:22] SmokedHog: they don't really care
[1:59:43] MN_Generic: if they want to I don't think they want to day raid
[1:59:49] sinlesssinner: @qblayy however pvers can keep spamming m+ with friends and keep getting chances at loot; pvp there is a cap on pts 550 a week, for a wpn u need to save up for 2 weeks
[1:59:51] LordKain73: @jayjeee_ so does echo KEKW
[1:59:53] SmokedHog: they need the infrastructure, weakaura guy, etc
[2:00:14] SmokedHog: they also need the gold for the BoEs
[2:00:19] feherlofia123: @sinlesssinner weapon is 4 weeks btw , 2 hander that is
[2:00:29] sinlesssinner: @qblayy i remember pvers saying the same thing about WoD pvp gear if u remember :) thats when blizzard listened and removed the npc
[2:00:35] TheVigiliance: Limit yeeted 3 members
[2:00:37] sinlesssinner: @feherlofia123 yea you are right :)
[2:00:38] Secondbreakfasttt: @sinlesssinner We will see my friend if is it fair or not in upcoming days
[2:00:45] Thoriakk: what do you think of MDT author asking for a sub to use the addon ?
[2:00:49] Masqerader: I think they lost one of their MTS to limit
[2:00:58] sinlesssinner: @qblayy its all good in the end :)
[2:00:59] Alzar_tv: @sinlesssinner And once you have that you can upgrade it beyond anything you get from end-of-runs from M+ by just hitting 1800
[2:01:06] SmokedHog: pieces lost members to echo because they could make money, fatshark lost members to lmit for same reason
[2:01:09] pereadin: Do we think servers will stay down for the full hour again?
[2:01:17] RadShiro: Which bag addon is that? Setting up UI
[2:01:17] Ordicos: world 3rd
[2:01:23] MrGattz: i think it doesnt matter because people have already ripped it and reuploaded it.
[2:01:25] noteworthynerd: Nobody is faulting him for wanting to make money, they're faulting him for how he did it
[2:01:27] MrGattz: so whatever
[2:01:31] Secondbreakfasttt: @sinlesssinner as long long as you are not trolinng is all good <3
[2:01:36] sinlesssinner: @Alzar_tv yea but thats weeks of commitment, for ONE piece of gear :p
[2:01:37] Thoriakk: yeah true
[2:01:38] Masqerader: Manbaby Dungeon Tools
[2:01:44] Drakenking: You can take donations for addons but you can't charge for it
[2:01:45] MuttonChopins: the wording is so 2004
[2:01:46] Strozuxx: !io
[2:01:56] SaltyTunapants: just use manbabytools , the spin off
[2:01:59] sinlesssinner: @qblayy i am def not, i was being honest :p
[2:02:10] Naturalbeef: The Keystone Guru website is way better than that add-on anyway
[2:02:12] TheVigiliance: He just going through some shit, his guildmates got his back
[2:02:16] Shinji_Ex: if was blizz I be lol u can not make munny off an ad-on for are game
[2:02:20] BlewGamingGroup: blizzard will be happy to give him a 2 week vacation to cool off
[2:02:20] Miffrah: @Towelliee are they looking in to class balance when they get back to work?
[2:02:22] feherlofia123: i got no intereesr in raids and m+ gave me a weird feeling this expac , so i turned into a pvper somwhow
[2:02:26] SmokedHog: are you talking about how asmon is raging about paid addons?
[2:02:32] ManneehFresh: People expect hard work for free and complain about people charging. Don’t make sense
[2:02:45] SaltyTunapants: is that how zygors gets around it?
[2:02:47] Kromede: yep thats clearly tos
[2:02:50] SaltyTunapants: since theres a base version
[2:02:52] Drakenking: Correct because it's blizzards IP
[2:02:56] Snabido: @jayjeee_ No, pay attention KEKW
[2:02:56] MrGattz: @SaltyTunapants yeah they have a free trial
[2:03:04] SpoonManes: every1 is just gonna add a half ass editor to their addons
[2:03:09] razjin0327: what time is reset again?
[2:03:12] falldrgn: the MDT guy did not take the last loss well. its just how hes handling it. they need to address it. its brining to much negative attention on to the team
[2:03:12] Endy253: I just never updated my MDT and it works great lol
[2:03:16] chronoit: the MDT guy is just being a baby.
[2:03:18] TheCheeseWheel87: wrong, zygor leveling guides is free but certain features are locked behind a pay wall via monthly sub
[2:03:25] elchaposkjelbo: Beat Method in Classic KEKW Beats Method in Retail KEKW
[2:03:27] pereadin: MDT works but the mob data is pay walled
[2:03:28] GermanBacon: @SaltyTunapants yes. you can make your own path in Zygors, and get their recommended paths when you buy it
[2:03:31] biirrd: Zygor?
[2:03:34] tulwinn: it does work but he has took a feature out and made it a pay optio
[2:03:35] Alienfromger: paywall could be patreon, twitch sub etc?
[2:03:36] Drakenking: Imagine how bad the game would be if you had to pay for Details or DBM
[2:03:37] Luquatic: which adodn?
[2:03:41] SaltyTunapants: or just torrent it lmao, fuck paying for addons
[2:03:42] Syrion93: I love Venthyr, why did I go Kyrian PepeHands
[2:03:48] TheGinjahNinja: anyone got a TLDR for this addon drama?
[2:03:51] SmokedHog: i'll never pay for an addon. just make it fully functional then a patreon if you like the addon. paywalls are terrible for this game
[2:03:54] MrGattz: well the free trial for something like a zygors guide gives you full guides up to level like 30 or whatever. at least as far as i know. so its fully functional, but you get a lot more functions when you pay $10 a month for it
[2:03:54] sinlesssinner: why u dont they make it work on a donations basis? thats a work-around? nah? @Towelliee
[2:03:56] Kromede: Syrion93 NotLikeThis
[2:04:00] chronoit: basically blizzard just needs to slap all the addons down that do any form of payment
[2:04:11] SinicalDev: People shouldnt be making money off their WA's either if the creator can't.
[2:04:13] swordwindgaming: dbm behind paywall would result in so many unsubs or people abandoning pve entirely
[2:04:17] SaltyTunapants: @TheGinjahNinja tank in echo mad he didnt get world first, man baby acting ensued now mdt costs money

[2:04:36] Mastermind1429: why not use the weak aura?
[2:04:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: Don;t forget to pick up "Replenish the Resevior" quest before heading out to the Would Boss. AND...kill the WB BEFORE you go to the GV!!
[2:04:37] Baron_Pandacula: as a kyrian, i agree, fix this shit
[2:04:39] Flux_Capacitor: same
[2:04:42] Alzar_tv: And MDT works without the map data that is pay walled, you just have to put forth the effort to fill it out or learn how Github works and go find the data tha the removed
[2:04:46] SmokedHog: it's dumb AF
[2:04:46] pilhass10: fix what LUL
[2:04:49] Drakenking: @chronoit not necessarily because that could adversely affect addon creators that arent fucking people over, things like DBM and Elvui, etc that take tons of time to develop and those devs often rely on those donations
[2:04:50] thiccsushi: fix legion raid scaling as well
[2:04:51] chaostheory8907: Yep I hate it
[2:04:51] Q_TheDreamer: Fix = Be Ardenweald
[2:04:55] Arocian: hahahahaha
[2:04:56] Yagr6: LUL
[2:05:01] Snabido: What are you, night fae LUL
[2:05:04] pereadin: KEKW
[2:05:05] Kromede: Jebaited
[2:05:07] gimmlay: ardenweald fairies ftw
[2:05:07] Drakenking: Your weakauras are shit at Autochess
[2:05:10] Attackroot: i use venture plan atm seems to work better
[2:05:11] Staksor: use Venture Plan addon? 🤔
[2:05:15] Drakenking: They're silver at best
[2:05:15] TheItalianStallion321: bro, you need +30 to win 5head....just kidding. yeah it sucks
[2:05:18] sussyrev: sucks at it, it doesnt work KEKW
[2:05:21] Masqerader: remember when it was just %
[2:05:24] Fensmarken: @Towelliee as a necrolord I do not feel your pain ;)
[2:05:32] Mostdangspy: plus the Anima rewards is a joke. You get 30 anima but it costs 25
[2:05:32] sevens777s: I was going to make a joke just now probably a bad idea ill come back later WutFace
[2:05:32] Alienfromger: "a chance" :p
[2:05:35] dimofodi: @Towelliee to beat the soul ash level 20 mission all my guys were level 30 as kyrian. The addon still said I would lose but I trashed them. The addons don't take in to account the special abilities.
[2:05:36] chronoit: @Drakenking That's fine. Shouldn't be making money off addons.
[2:05:39] SmokedHog: bad weakauras
[2:05:40] Kromede: rng win
[2:05:41] xavier2119: There is an actual addon for that @Towelliee
[2:05:43] Mockle: min maxing the shit out if it, still lossing
[2:05:45] sinlesssinner: this expac is not so nice to @Towelliee :p
[2:05:56] gimmlay: I have no issues as kyrian
[2:06:10] Thoriakk: What is infuriating me is the "gating shit" of Bolvar quests !!!!!
[2:06:10] PadidinJones: I decided I was not going to unlock the table
[2:06:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: Yeap....Level 28-24 Venthyr Companions losing to Level 20 Rares for Soul Ash..Great system Blizzard!!! 4Head 4Head
[2:06:15] WasabiFH: WasabiFH subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[2:06:18] Bedpan_BoB: I liked BFA and legion mission tables. This Shadowlands shit sucks.
[2:06:19] Kromede: THE BLI$$ARD
[2:06:20] dimofodi: The addons don't account for the special abilities so they aren't fully accurate.
[2:06:21] TheCheeseWheel87: venthyr tables are the hardest tbh
[2:06:21] dkwhitegorilla: Server Shutdown Count down has started
[2:06:23] xavier2119: I cant beat my kyrian missions. I still have the soul ash one, its impossible
[2:06:34] Gaaralock: @Towelliee I failed my first level 60 mission this morning... feelsbadman
[2:06:48] MrGattz: its extremely unclear how stuff is calculated with the missions and the fact that its so rng really sucks
[2:06:50] Drakenking: @chronoit Sorry but you're wrong when it comes to large addons like DBM etc and it takes a full time development job to keep it up to date and working, you're asking for the dev to donate that time entirely for free, they absolutely should be able to make money off of the product if people would like to pay them, because simply put without that quite a few of the addons we have wouldnt exist
[2:07:06] dkwhitegorilla: @towelliee it says about an hr
[2:07:08] chaostheory8907: I can’t even beat half themissions for adventure upgrade tokens, I don’t get it
[2:07:10] chronoit: @Drakenking then we can stop using them until someone takes it up as a passion project.
[2:07:10] SmokedHog: I'm liking the 1 hour resets lately
[2:07:12] MuttonChopins: there is a weakaura that tells you the chances of you winning
[2:07:19] Machvelli: you can just use all ardenweald trappers and cheese every mission because the debuff stacks lol haven’t failed any missions as nightfae
[2:07:25] Ezzenlive: Do we know what weekly quest we will have this week?
[2:07:35] tulwinn: I feel like you should be able to see before you send it, that way is like a puzzle
[2:07:35] Beave_86: Front: Meatball, Ayeleth, Rahel Back: Nadija, Theotar This will work
[2:07:40] NVbrutal: what level does followers need to be to pass venthyr soul ash missions? most of mine are lvl 25 and i still fail them
[2:07:44] gorilla_quantistico: @Ezzenlive tw
[2:07:44] KonradGM: im just making sure for my missions i have more dmg and health than enemy and it's only thing i look at lol
[2:07:45] xavier2119: @chronoit That's just selfish, you do it lol
[2:07:46] Drakenking: @chronoit so we can stop until something completely unrealistic happens, ok
[2:07:47] jeneraljelly: It's just the one follower cheese
[2:08:02] kodtheog: I get the loyal gorger mount today im so hyped @towelliee

[2:23:16] NashMarco: blizzard pls balance table missions game literally unplayable NotLikeThis
[2:23:16] danksportscards: why didn't they add a currency to M+ so we could at least buy gear eventually
[2:23:17] pereadin: Legion dungeons + M+ saved that expansion
[2:23:21] SamDavidsin: @LspN it just went down, wont be up for an hour
[2:23:27] Teknofear64: I agree, the dungeons are good!
[2:23:27] datcreepa: since maybe cata dungeons

[2:23:30] casualboomer: @Towelliee finally getting my prot pally geared a bit. Makes my DH feel like kindergarten for special needs. V DH is so brainless
[2:23:31] akia03: 9.1 will come after we get renown 40
[2:23:33] griffdog125: having pet battles as wkly q is ass

[2:23:36] MuttonChopins: Ghostcrawler MMO waiting room Kappa
[2:23:40] GarfielfArbuncle: Will Frost mage ever get buffed PepeHands
[2:23:44] Tyrrless: What legendary did you pick?
[2:23:48] Bro00: despite my sucking at pvp, I enjoy the pace of pvp this xpac over previous iterations
[2:23:51] billybaroo1: demon hunters are fine Kappa
[2:23:53] xrandomdoodx: why wouldn't they at least buff the underperforming ones to match the top ones then? I mean anything is better than nothing
[2:24:03] Affiiance: How much do you think Prot Pally being not great do you think plays into your feelings?
[2:24:03] Vattss: What are the affixes?
[2:24:03] datcreepa: vdh needed buffs
[2:24:07] NVbrutal: major classes changes wont happen until next raid is about to release
[2:24:14] Darkfall_NL: @Towelliee when do you expect 9.1 at the earliest?
[2:24:17] inj0shwetrust: They could just buff Havoc a bit .... it does seem hella weak
[2:24:22] Bonedit: is this beta? how are u still playing?
[2:24:23] paul9719: hey @towelliee just came back after a break since legion and was wondering which one would you recommand for shadowlands: mage or hunter?
[2:24:25] skysinge: i was doing CN Normal the other day and we had a dps DH that did 300 dps less than the tanks LUL
[2:24:25] SamDavidsin: Towelliee you should invite towel claus over in
[2:24:27] Vattss: Do people know what are the new afixes this week?
[2:24:28] SamDavidsin: July
[2:24:29] Bonedit: thought servers went down
[2:24:30] PaydayPaylor: I miss Titanforging....I'm a casual who relied on my luck to get gear :(
[2:24:32] pereadin: @Bonedit EU account
[2:24:34] TheRavenGrave: So you think that this Xpac seems a little rushed?? More so than any other Xpac????
[2:24:43] Its_Me_MG: its EU @Bonedit
[2:24:44] Bonedit: @pereadin ah thx
[2:24:52] tawney_owl_: @xrandomdoodx alas blizz has a fucked prespective on balancing, instead of powering up weak options, they just make the strong ones shit and it creates a cycle of nerfing
[2:24:58] itsagentscully: inspiring, necrotic, prideful, yrannical @Vattss
[2:24:58] casualboomer: California hippies LUL
[2:25:03] Deggon: @Towelliee now that expac has been out for a bit now, has anything surprised you or disappointed you?
[2:25:17] Amarlian: one thing they did well is release so many systems but make it so you still feel you can play an alt @Towelliee
[2:25:22] Sliccs: It is just a game.
[2:25:26] Frank4LuLz: IRVINR hippies
[2:25:27] Fragnest: They dont deserve vacation i guess
[2:25:32] swordwindgaming: @tawney_owl_ its easier for them to wield the nerfbat than to revamp weak classes and talent trees
[2:25:33] smilylol_: @Towelliee on your shade application, what is the logs that youre referring to?
[2:25:41] Frank4LuLz: Irvine Hippie's.
[2:25:52] pereadin: @diggestbickest your warcraftlogs character link
[2:25:53] Sollice: Truthfully I think loot is EXACTLY where they want it to be...My takeaway from this expansion, and I am ok with it, is they want people to not unsub. They are going to stretch things out to keep you playing the entire expansion
[2:26:01] smilylol_: ty
[2:26:03] Remeork: As someone just returning, I'm so lost as to what to do. And addons have become so over the top from BC/Wrath that as I get nearly done, I find something to be so broken that I have to start over.
[2:26:04] pereadin: @diggestbickest so they can evaluate your performance in a raiding environment
[2:26:09] thiccsushi: @Towelliee Is that toy still in the game with the tier 3 sets that people were melting down about a few months ago in revendreth?
[2:26:09] Naturalbeef: The Calling quest with the bar fill is annoyingly bugged. You get zero credit for dungeon bosses
[2:26:14] tahmkenchonly: @Towelliee if you kill the moths and the reindeers u can gain alot of gold.
[2:26:18] noggywoggy: but that is good, they need a lot of data
[2:26:22] Vattss: @itsagentscully Thank you
[2:26:25] Crazycajun985: Thought that servers were down
[2:26:34] SmokedHog: basically big issues, fix right now
[2:26:38] SmokedHog: then fine tune for 2 years
[2:26:39] MeekPR4L: @Sollice uhm LUL isn't that the whole goal of any MMO/game sub
[2:26:40] aftershockzzzz: @sollice that’s been the game for years now
[2:26:41] jimmwayne: when reset ?
[2:26:43] Creepy_Janitor: I wish Warriors was in a better spot
[2:26:54] Alaquane: reset is right now
[2:26:56] Sollice: The game has never been as time gated as it is now
[2:27:01] DarthLemon: will m+ loot get better?
[2:27:06] noteworthynerd: Gear is the grind now. Before it was AP...
[2:27:08] lithium364: you mena fine tune every 4 month like in bfa :(
[2:27:10] beefnstien: @DarthLemon nah
[2:27:17] Sollice: BfA had the war story but what else was so time gated?
[2:27:19] Average_Stali: @Creepy_Janitor i switched to warrior for my raid, and im hoping that they get some sort of buff soon
[2:27:19] Seerated: Not even an FAQ in there for Havoc atm :O
[2:27:23] SmokedHog: ret pally got a lot of hype in the beginning of the xpac, but it's middle of the pack now unforch
[2:27:24] D3m0nHunt3r666: they have a discord? Kappa
[2:27:29] PvtHudson093: ret is good for a change
[2:27:29] scenario17: scenario17 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:27:33] Vivelli: constant memeing of re-rolling FeelsBadMan
[2:27:34] laeenaravenholdt: But I still enjoy playing my havoc DH. Kinda sad. lol
[2:27:37] datcreepa: it's been hell for melee dps this xp
[2:27:49] Tyrrless: Prot Paladin > Ret Paladin
[2:27:51] noteworthynerd: Tell that to WW and Unholy DK Kappa
[2:27:51] Sollice: @datcreepa I switched off to hunter lol
[2:27:51] miztertea1: Servers started going down
[2:27:51] HAMMERRAZOR: RIP HAVOC FeelsBadMan
[2:27:52] Seerated: Yea, The Fel Hammer is their Discord I think
[2:27:59] MeekPR4L: @Sollice Every xpac has the same complaint,no? Honestly with SL your not forced nearly as much as compared to prev xpacs
[2:28:00] pereadin: @Towelliee do you have PO Box by chance?
[2:28:05] capricore: What I don’t get, is most industries make sure they have coverage for vacations, why does blizzard shut down the entire operation 🤷♂️
[2:28:06] noggywoggy: rogue, ww and dk all do very well though, right_
[2:28:08] Deggon: Thanks for the 2020Shred @scenario17
[2:28:14] MaliciousDH: what baffles me is why bad players continue to pay monthly
[2:28:18] jbeastb: Why Havoc mad? According to warcraftlogs they are dead smack in mid pack... trying playing an enhance shaman... that's where we live
[2:28:23] pereadin: Yeah I'll hit you up in a few days for it
[2:28:25] SmokedHog: they pull the covid card. make it as incovenient as possible
[2:28:25] casualboomer: Mailing dog poop is illegal chat
[2:28:33] Bonedit: how did you move the talking head window? to the left side? when the fairy was talking
[2:28:33] Jkeyboards: fingers crossed for a 220 wep in my vault today
[2:28:34] Sliccs: @towelliee PIECES killed last boss for world 3RD
[2:28:35] Sollice: @MeekPR4L I am not complaining about it all. I rather enjoy the steady pace. But I think this expansion, more than any, they are trying to slow drip everything to us
[2:28:36] scenario17: @Deggon towHAMUP
[2:28:39] duusstin: hahaha
[2:28:45] MeekPR4L: MeekPR4L subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Thanks for the streams, they help so much! <3 Wepa!
[2:28:48] wasty00: havoc isn't the worst if you know how to play
[2:28:57] wackeeeEEE: Is Ony a reference to Onyxia?
[2:28:57] LUKA_THIM: yea havoc is fine
[2:28:58] thiccsushi: They just want to send you some gamer bath water to help you clear castle nathria Kappa
[2:29:04] Vivelli: havocs issue is that vengeance is good
[2:29:06] SmokedHog: i've been in some groups with havoc pumping dps
[2:29:11] PvtHudson093: @wackeeeEEE yes
[2:29:13] pereadin: its only reknown progression for most of the coves
[2:29:17] Average_Stali: new appearances
[2:29:19] hadusii: Tmog?
[2:29:21] mrniceguy817: @wasty00 If you know how to play havoc lol did they get more then 4 buttons or something
[2:29:24] Allvarez: yeah i think havoc is okay in m+
[2:29:25] Ardailec: Ele Shaman get their BiS legendary
[2:29:26] RootOfImagination: 6th tier soul bind
[2:29:26] Alaquane: we get more souls out of the maw this week from being 15 last week
[2:29:28] smilylol_: 18
[2:29:33] Tensei_c: more than 5 souls?
[2:29:33] Fragglevision: ^
[2:29:33] Jkeyboards: and one more cosmetic I think
[2:29:36] feherlofia123: so many V DHs i play with are total noobs , i refuse them
[2:29:37] PidiaP: Ele BiS day towPog
[2:29:40] schizowillie: Gettting carried thru at least one mythic so I can open that vault
[2:29:42] TheItalianStallion321: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny
[2:29:42] wackeeeEEE: that's super cute
[2:29:44] Watts__: When does 3rd Soulbind unlock?
[2:29:53] jbeastb: so what if vengence is good... it's a tank. If it were another dps spec then I'd see your point
[2:29:53] MrJ195: for real?
[2:29:54] razma_: server list already up
[2:29:54] djbutterknife: are servers up or still maintenance?

[2:29:59] Sollice: Third soulbind doesnt open for a while I dont think
[2:30:00] Allvarez: saying x class is a bunch of noobs is ignorant
[2:30:04] EternalGloryx: Is there any sites to help out as a returning player to know what builds are good and elations? Is icy veins still relevant?
[2:30:04] lithium364: 3 min cooldown on jump Kappa
[2:30:07] Average_Stali: US servers are down atm
[2:30:10] Deggon: Ony is already chipped? when did she get the Corona Vaccine
[2:30:12] MeekPR4L: @Sollice at least player power doesn't feel completely gated, i guess depending on spec.
[2:30:12] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: to be fair vengeance was garbage in bfa more or less
[2:30:12] the_chungis: @PidiaP what do you mean Ele BIS what do they get?
[2:30:12] PrxSick: why dont they release the raid at global time instead of tuestday wednesday, the advantage limit has is crazy
[2:30:16] beefnstien: @StorkBoyGaming list is up but servers are down
[2:30:18] NVbrutal: third soulbind doesnt open up till campaign is completely done
[2:30:19] brockc93: I dont think vengance is op
[2:30:20] moeszyslak66: nerf elysian drecree !
[2:30:27] hamwise_: hey dude , thinking about picking up prot warrior. thoughts on them?
[2:30:29] brockc93: everything else needs to get a buff
[2:30:33] Syrion93: Happy Vault Day sir.
[2:30:33] thiccsushi: VDH has been waiting for like 2+ years to be let them have their cake
[2:30:35] mrniceguy817: @prxsick What advantage does limit have?
[2:30:40] Thoriakk: fiery soul
[2:30:40] MuttonChopins: VDH is really fun to play
[2:30:41] stormbear7: @Towelliee whens prot pal turn lol
[2:30:43] Jkeyboards: warrior tank has a hard time holding aggro in m+ last few I ran with I pulled aggro off them alot
[2:30:43] Staksor: @PrxSick because of time zones maybe 🤔
[2:30:44] billybaggens: it reduces cooldown of fiery brand by 2 secs fir every soul cleave
[2:30:49] Thoriakk: IT IS SO OP !
[2:30:50] feherlofia123: i dont get why vengeance is so OP... they seem bad to me, and im a healer
[2:30:52] billybaggens: yes
[2:30:55] Thoriakk: Fiery Soul
[2:30:56] casualboomer: Fiery brand leggo is super strong till you're geared enough to get the Razelekh's rolling
[2:30:56] tysuki666: are top guilds only using dh tank because they need the magic buff and dps dh are literal dogshit so no one wants them
[2:31:04] billybaggens: fiery soul is bis
[2:31:13] PaydayPaylor: @Towelliee I am loving the Guardian Druid Barkskin = Ironfur&Regen 2x. its so strong
[2:31:14] MeekPR4L: @feherlofia123 its strong, and good dps
[2:31:15] maccaruso: Fury warriors can tank dungeons. They should get a buff too, you know, to be faur.
[2:31:15] Thoriakk: it is only for Kyrian
[2:31:24] stopdodgin: havoc in m+ is good, not mythic raiding
[2:31:27] casualboomer: Fiery Soul is a ToP drop
[2:31:30] feherlofia123: @maccaruso squishy u mean
[2:31:32] jokergtv: is this eu?
[2:31:34] casualboomer: or Razelikh's is
[2:31:36] casualboomer: excuse me
[2:31:41] Allvarez: i got my raz leggo yesterday, its insane
[2:31:43] BlewGamingGroup: reduces cooldown on brand
[2:31:46] Allvarez: so much dmg
[2:31:47] 0alpha12358: they worked hunters so stupidly
[2:31:50] Thoriakk: UH DK is amazing iin M+ ;)
[2:31:52] Jahknowme: realm list is up
[2:31:57] casualboomer: Razelikh's is off the big cleave boss in ToP
[2:32:02] SSD511_: List up
[2:32:03] TheUnknowing: ive been using fiery soul or whatever its called, i honestly like it a lot mainly cause i hate spirit bomb lol
[2:32:05] Thoriakk: yes it is
[2:32:06] billybaggens: yeah
[2:32:07] TheUnknowing: yes
[2:32:08] Jkeyboards: love my UH DK
[2:32:09] casualboomer: Firey brand build is SO STRONG in M+ too. Especially M+ week
[2:32:12] billybaggens: and with talents u make is spread
[2:32:12] Average_Stali: yes
[2:32:18] d0c7: relem list is up
[2:32:18] Seerated: Yea, both oddensive and defensive
[2:32:23] Seerated: offensive*
[2:32:24] LUKA_THIM: 1 min
[2:32:24] casualboomer: 1 minute
[2:32:25] jbeastb: @Towelliee ALl this crying about Havoc... Try maining an Enhancement shaman... BUFF THEM!
[2:32:28] casualboomer: less soul cleaves
[2:32:29] trivwik: Happy Loot day!
[2:32:33] billybaggens: plus immolation aura makes it last long with talent
[2:32:33] trivwik: Last loot day of the year
[2:32:35] epiczplz: have yous seen the firey brand m plus build @towelliee
[2:32:40] casualboomer: 1 minute LESS the amount of soul cleaves x 2 seconds
[2:32:43] thiccsushi: 1min before the legendary reduces the cd?
[2:32:45] schizowillie: What is a good legendary for resto druid for 5 mans and maybe normal 10 mans?
[2:32:50] Booogie0: @Towelliee you have a talent that lets you spread the brand to all nearby enemies
[2:32:56] TheUnknowing: and the legendary reduces the cd every soul you consume
[2:32:57] Average_Stali: well, rerolling vengeance, brb
[2:32:57] Allvarez: yes @thiccsushi
[2:33:10] Pgang31: I smell some Veng DH and Resto SHam nerfs coming soon
[2:33:10] sharie: im Happy for the Vengeance DH Mains
[2:33:17] Gingerprimer: @Willeaze the resto guide on woehad has some tips on what leggo to use
[2:33:18] casualboomer: Sigil is only used by highly geared groups. If you're not geared well, fiery brand is amazing
[2:33:24] epiczplz: high keys brand build
[2:33:25] razma_: just buff bearrrr dmg :)
[2:33:27] Booogie0: sigil for dps brand for survival
[2:33:28] datcreepa: depends. on playstyle
[2:33:32] I_DoctorSatan_I: BibleThump Ysera
[2:33:34] griznasty94: @Towelliee how are you playing right now? servers are down?
[2:33:41] I_DoctorSatan_I: that would be a badass mount!!
[2:33:42] ReverendBaka: At highest keys I think everyone uses the Brand one
[2:33:46] casualboomer: You use sigil to do lower keys for multiple chests because the burst damage is so strong.
[2:33:47] inj0shwetrust: He is on EU
[2:33:48] Sollice: He is on EU
[2:33:48] R_zampa: 1 min, the legendary reduces the cd, and u can drop a conduit that lowers the cd even more @Towelliee
[2:33:51] Allvarez: yeah there are 2 builds, brand build and fragment spender built
[2:33:53] SSD511_: Just afk
[2:33:55] BlewGamingGroup: @Towelliee between the lego and the conduits for fiery brand it put the uptime around 60-80% due to talents being able to lengthen the uptime and spread
[2:34:00] casualboomer: Fiery brand does do damage, but it's negligible
[2:34:01] Average_Stali: yes
[2:34:04] slammers199: You have any tips for generating threat for vengeance demon hunters in mythic + dungones? @Towelliee
[2:34:06] thatkittybella: yah ysera is badass
[2:34:06] trivwik: @Willeaze The Memory of the Mother Tree is the best for 10 man and mythics as a blanket lego. Best for m+ is hands down Circle of Life and Death
[2:34:07] Mallaes: The Hero! PogChamp
[2:34:11] Bubbyyz: @Towelliee do u know of any nurfs or buffs today ?
[2:34:11] Mallaes: He ded :(
[2:34:13] rohdey: speaking of mounts, have they said anything about our 'free mount'
[2:34:14] Uutef: elysian decree is way more damage
[2:34:14] datcreepa: and if you spec into spirit bomb
[2:34:14] Jkeyboards: I watched a veng solo a mythic 10 boss granted it was at 30 percent but
[2:34:19] neimac2: the sigil one is prio if your kyrian
[2:34:29] casualboomer: Vengeance is fine where it's at. It's not like they're doing 100k in TD procs constantly
[2:34:34] Alaquane: bring back the bears
[2:34:36] R_zampa: he is goob but not as war on bfa
[2:34:36] BlewGamingGroup: fiery brand for pushing keys , decree for farm
[2:34:37] Repozer: @Towelliee so you are raiding on your monk?
[2:34:40] casualboomer: Honestly, the AoE cap keeps VDH reasonable
[2:34:40] Average_Stali: kinda like warriors for BFA then
[2:34:44] Karbonn: I'm just happy Ysera is back.
[2:34:45] stormbear7: that would be terrible
[2:34:50] atomheart232: just like guardian in legion haha
[2:34:52] razma_: pieces just killed denatrius
[2:34:55] FrozenShades: Brewmaster isnt bad though..
[2:34:58] razma_: world third
[2:35:00] bwade87: what are the best tanks right now?
[2:35:08] billybaggens: me and my other tank were prot palli and have since switched to brew/veng
[2:35:08] Jkeyboards: brew is great
[2:35:13] casualboomer: Prot Pally seems strong in keys. How is it that bad in raid?
[2:35:14] SSD511_: I remember this quest damn it’s like two years or so
[2:35:19] SlayerLightStorm: Rip Ysera
[2:35:21] FrozenShades: @Towelliee Why is Prot paladin bad? Im sorry I dont know
[2:35:21] scottiepalmer: what server is boss man playing on, mione arent up
[2:35:24] D3m0nHunt3r666: aren't paladins doing good in m+?
[2:35:24] MrTomalot: Why is Prot pally bad?
[2:35:25] MetalManGG: but weren't prot pallies great at the start of the xpac?
[2:35:26] lithium364: they made prot pally into an pvp tank lol
[2:35:27] schizowillie: Ty for the help
[2:35:29] stormbear7: right so when do we get fixed lol
[2:35:32] Frank4LuLz: Prot Bad???? what did i miss
[2:35:34] BraerHZ: my guild MT is a prot pally *oof*
[2:35:39] casualboomer: Is it tuning issues for prot pally in raid? Are they just too squishy for big one shots?
[2:35:42] Irrevocable2: prot pally is squish
[2:35:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: however brew was top tier for spiteful
[2:35:43] Bubbyyz: why is prot pally bad ?
[2:35:47] scottiepalmer: I dont think Prot is bad think vengenance is just better
[2:35:49] WoW_StandalonE: ye, its strange, prot pala was destined to be the best tank for progression, but yeah, they r fucked atm
[2:35:49] feherlofia123: prot pala too squishy , whst would help ? more armor ?
[2:35:52] Noobicron: my guild has brew veng
[2:35:57] gorilla_quantistico: maybe with gear
[2:36:02] scottiepalmer: yea yea
[2:36:08] Buckwink: its 2 times better
[2:36:08] thatgart: this eu?
[2:36:09] GarfielfArbuncle: Fix frost mage PepeHands
[2:36:10] casualboomer: Vengeance with Phial of Putrefaction pumps on single target
[2:36:12] Bubbyyz: @Towelliee can u rank tanks please

[4:00:40] duffluv22: You had 2 orbs back there
[4:00:41] Aidler: @towelliee you left a power behind
[4:00:41] Thadune: WW84 was trash in my opnion
[4:00:47] Vigi9413: I heard Soul is a tear jerker
[4:00:57] RaNGo: @Towelliee what layer is that
[4:01:01] pedroj632: ww84 was so dumb
[4:01:09] lithium364: will you do ulduar timewalking?
[4:01:13] xvstormvx: @Towelliee and if you havent watched queens gambit.. watch it.. its awsome mini series
[4:01:19] reliabletree: this layer on floor 5 was not fun on my MM hunter BibleThump
[4:01:27] Colt_Engineer: ww84 was so much better than the first one
[4:01:30] oilerr: is twisting corridors open on NA?
[4:01:37] Thadune: No

[4:02:38] BurtMacklin410: next week for people who are on the last quest...the torghast storyline is gated per week per character. no catch up
[4:02:45] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee they ve been doing this since Legion man, gating of the campaign quests. You dont like how they are doing it now?
[4:02:47] primeforgta: What wings are opeeeen? Please chat Someone must know it
[4:02:51] thatguynamedjans: lol timewalking dungeons are dropping ilvl 36 gear and not counting towards the quest progression @Towelliee

[4:04:03] inj0shwetrust: Probably a good Idea to wait to turn in the quest for timewalking then
[4:04:09] Alaquane: timewalking dungeon went really fast
[4:04:12] Felldoh_: wait, so timewalking is bugged?
[4:04:14] VrtniPatuljak: world of gatecraft
[4:04:14] Artivicii: gated community 4Head
[4:04:16] Thadune: LFR is the biggest gated thing in WOW
[4:04:16] Kromede: even gates are gated NotLikeThis
[4:04:17] casualboomer: LUL
[4:04:22] inj0shwetrust: Wait a day or so see if they adjust it
[4:04:25] Aegrial: BabyRage BabyRage
[4:04:31] zaraine1: im dying LUL
[4:04:31] sinlesssinner: yes @Towelliee finally go ham on blizzard :)
[4:04:37] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee is there a TW quest? for a piece of gear?
[4:04:38] tyrel_jones: LOLOL
[4:04:40] casualboomer: Blizzard is just low key trying to keep the BoE markets inflated so Limit can earn some gold back and not roll RMT like Method did
[4:04:43] Alaquane: someone go test Ulduar for me
[4:04:48] PowaPatrick: How did you know the reason I don't play WoW?????
[4:04:48] lithium364: yeah cant wait to get my last piece from nathria in 4 month when 9.1 are out :D
[4:04:48] Artivicii: true that
[4:04:50] duffluv22: mates and tea!!!
[4:04:50] qashii: nobody knows which torghast wings are open this ID for NA ? :(
[4:04:52] KingSlayerYotam: loot in wow is a comedic tragedy
[4:04:52] VrtniPatuljak: but seriously, gating is a cheap way to extend content. mark of a shit developer
[4:04:57] kodtheog: what is the condensed sytgia in your vault loot
[4:05:01] hisdue: the maw is suppose to suck that's why it has a rep grimd
[4:05:04] SumZeroGG: casuals towCry
[4:05:05] piratechris: Hey now I'm casual and still having fun
[4:05:12] MagiMetal: ^
[4:05:12] Syllvn: @VrtniPatuljak You literally cannot do an mmo without gating xD
[4:05:18] inj0shwetrust: I need to do TW on my PrPaladin it has the most badges and I want the mount from Wrath actually decent looking
[4:05:20] sinlesssinner: @VrtniPatuljak they ve been doing it since legion, nothing to make a fuss about
[4:05:23] HaloS23: Am i the only one that is just having fun?
[4:05:25] defender95: @Towelliee what wings r open for torghast?
[4:05:27] SilkeySmooth: its what you all wanted loot to mean something
[4:05:31] VrtniPatuljak: simplySylvan you absolutely can, vanilla wasnt gated
[4:05:35] Aegrial: nah.. im having fun.. listening to the constant whining is pretty fun too
[4:05:44] verdant85: they're just prepping us for TBC classic
[4:05:44] SoulessWar: SoulessWar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[4:05:45] PorAmor: 2pe13
[4:05:46] Vigi9413: you think they'll let more loot drop? or put bonus rolls back in?
[4:05:55] EvoCyberNation: They can actually lose their long time players as well. They need to find that center zone and to not be excessively giving or taking items.
[4:05:55] tyrel_jones: Listen, theres always gonna be whining with wow, no matter how good it is
[4:05:56] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak you could do KT day 1?
[4:05:59] xvstormvx: @Towelliee watch queens gambit.. such a good show
[4:06:06] casualboomer: Blizzard didn't want degenerate gameplay, so they gated everything. Which means all alts have to be kept up weekly. Which creates degenerate gameplay. Life is a hamster wheel
[4:06:06] Dabogimp: @Towelliee i just came back to wow after like 7 yhears is timewalking not supposed to drop low lvl gear?
[4:06:21] itz_nostra: yep Im fine with loot, vault is still huge upgrade from single chest
[4:06:28] Syllvn: @Dabogimp Should be scaled to be relevant
[4:06:30] lithium364: take it
[4:06:31] Kromede: rip
[4:06:37] chubby_ch4ser: fcked
[4:06:38] Artivicii: KEKW
[4:06:39] Xailen: Timewalking gear is bugged
[4:06:39] MisterElectric: jump jump
[4:06:39] casualboomer: Just made Torghast take three hours LUL
[4:06:40] Cephyon: jump
[4:06:40] EvoCyberNation: You have to keep moving
[4:06:43] Vigi9413: you just made this run so much longer lol
[4:06:44] Toonaww: thats gonna get annoying lol
[4:06:44] sinlesssinner: @EvoCyberNation i doubt ppl will quit, a lot of ppl are loving this expac.
[4:06:45] atomheart232: bruh I hate that talent
[4:06:48] Wcvechten: jumping insta removes it
[4:06:49] Cephyon: jump and you dont get rooted
[4:06:50] VrtniPatuljak: MistaHat KT didnt exist day 1 neither did Molten Core, now they delay stuff on purpose
[4:06:50] SumZeroGG: its the no jumping again
[4:06:54] Xindii: 6 hour floors inc LUL
[4:06:56] kaybrink: Bruh that stop smoking add was messed up @towelliee
[4:07:04] EvoCyberNation: That's why I said "possibly" @sinlesssinner :)
[4:07:06] PK_Scobie: dave chapelle
[4:07:11] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak Mc did...you just had to get attuned for it which was another form of timegasting
[4:07:11] raldrik: tougast X speed
[4:07:12] Teknofear64: ants in the pants
[4:07:16] ctrium: lmaooo
[4:07:17] byrdeen45: once you loot your done hehe
[4:07:18] Sollice: I dont think he controls the add content
[4:07:19] ArcaneMaki: 5 more floors
[4:07:46] qashii: Skoldus Hall wing in Torghast open this ID ? @Towelliee
[4:07:51] matty941413: !ilvl
[4:07:51] VrtniPatuljak: MistaHat you can get attuned in 1 day, work isnt gating. and no mc was added in 1.4
[4:07:56] Kromede: this is good with druids
[4:08:01] CozzyFlannel: the stacking fire damage is so annoying. As a hunter it feels like i just have to fly through the floors befoe i die
[4:08:15] ArcaneMaki: I never got it on my guardian druid.
[4:08:23] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak even better example of timegating then lol
[4:08:39] Cephyon: yes

[4:09:01] Thadune: @Towelliee You need to the one that heals you based on health
[4:09:14] shawty918: what layer are you doing @towelliee ?
[4:09:25] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak i mean, they def didnt just make it available randomly, they had it pre planned and released it at a later time

[4:09:47] VrtniPatuljak: MistaHat intent is the difference. now stuff is held back to extend sub time. before it was released as soon as it was ready
[4:10:04] MagiMetal: that's laughable
[4:10:14] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak ok now youre talking about intent over timegating or not, that's a better argument than "it never existed" lol

[4:11:04] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak also how did you know it was "released when ready" ? you wernt there in the design room or the building lol swtay off mmorpg/r my dude
[4:11:08] cheersfordoobies: i got meat hooked oh no the vault!
[4:11:55] Syllvn: People always overestimate how much content they can pump out, the more they drop the more people expect. There is MORE than enough rn
[4:12:16] VrtniPatuljak: MistaHat I watched alot of old interviews, they were sad they had to launch without a raid but didnt finish on time
[4:12:26] Wcvechten: You need that 65% damage reduction from the anima orb you throw at dudes
[4:13:04] VrtniPatuljak: MistaHat they even released T2 without the cool looks just so it would come out earlier, and change looks later
[4:13:17] MistaHat: @VrtniPatuljak i mean, then they would be more efficient now considering they wait 2 weeks after every major patch to launch a new raid. so..im not seeing your point. seems like their intent is the same except now they are better at it
[4:13:32] MagiMetal: @simplySylvan that's exactly right, and yes there is more than enough right now. Mythic raiders do not depict average players content needs.
[4:13:50] pedroj632: @Towelliee do you think tier sets will ever come back?
[4:13:55] MagiMetal: But listening to them constantly does hurt them.
[4:14:03] Colt_Engineer: hey uh @Towelliee servers are back up

[4:45:35] Deathkanigit101: @Vigi9413 instead of buying the 190 then the 210 then the 225 gear you can just buy the 225 gear and craft the legendary it will just cost the same amount of soul ash as it would be to craft the legendary and the upgrades.

[6:16:31] Raanoren: callings are complete crap.

[6:17:35] MagiMetal: @Ka5h3d I love the maw - it's annoying, but I think it's supposed to be, and that's fun for me. Callings, idk. 2k gold feels better than a piece of gear I don't need like previous xpansions.
[6:17:41] dwolters_the_zombieman: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:18:31] Ka5h3d: @MagiMetal I guess my biggest frustration with the maw is how quickly the bar fills up, if it filled up at half the rate I think it would be better personally. With callings vs envoys I think it's better to know what you'd get before having to do it and pray to RNG you get something good
