[4:37:39] alteration1545: I haven't played the last couple CoDs though
[4:37:51] SylarSavage: PlateUp!, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Skull and Bones, The Thaumaturge. Those are games that are coming out in about a week to 2 weeks.
[4:38:17] alteration1545: I heard the finals is fun
[4:38:43] Darkside1366: the finals is wild  no sbmm so its touhgh
[4:40:19] Darkside1366: welp more Palworld i guess
[4:42:01] SylarSavage: They need to do so much work to update the game. It's so buggy and laggy still despite all the updates already
[4:42:17] SylarSavage: Like I have zero lag in my own server by myself but the second I go to my cousins server of just him and me, it lags
[4:42:31] alteration1545: little burnt on enshrouded already?
[4:42:57] alteration1545: for sure
[4:43:08] alteration1545: finish valheim too?
[4:43:23] SylarSavage: I'm actually glad I didn't buy Enshrouded. Game looked fun, but just not worth paying for.
[4:43:54] mentosz09: luxthoHi
[4:44:28] mentosz09: Doing alright rainy day been tired af all day
[4:44:39] SylarSavage: Yeah but I've payed less for games I've gotten more time out of. Not saying Enshrouded wouldn't be fun or I wouldn't get my moneys worth, it just didn't seem like a game I'd put a lot of time into
[4:45:48] ZavhenGhorr: I have to do a Performance Review for my Manager and i am reading their accomplishments and what they did for the 9 month period and I wanna bang my head against a wall it is so boring to read
