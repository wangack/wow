[0:39:24] Maxxramus: so close
[0:39:43] maru_yumalnoh: I know its a weird request but can you pull your blm gauge a bit to the right? facecam blocking the timer
[0:39:53] fNandow: chat, how much of a difference does the legacy ultimate bis gear make compared to synced-down gear?
[0:40:14] TK_Wrath: I love TOP we took 2 newer ult raiders in and they got so excited 😆
[0:40:21] Pandy_187: @fNandow if you want to get rank 1s you'll need it, if you want to clear it's irrelevant
[0:40:36] sirchubbycheeks1: Like max 5% dps increase
[0:41:15] neKyou: @fNandow synced down gear is bis for legacys
[0:41:19] fNandow: @fNandow i don't aim for rank 1 but i want to have fun parsing. at least purple or orange parse
[0:41:28] dbn117: I want to try TOP soon but the DPS check looks hardcore dont thing I am good enough
[0:41:42] xd_danteus: @dbn117 Just believe in yourself and have confidence. You could do it
[0:41:44] ChoaUtatane: i was so excited for TOP but my first group kept dying to pantokrator for 2 weeks, kinda killed my mood for it xD
[0:42:08] Pandy_187: if you have the shb relic then use it for tea, but i wouldn't worry about dungeon gear for legacy ults
[0:42:11] TK_Wrath: Yoshi can't do ults anyways ;)
[0:42:16] TK_Wrath: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:42:18] ashara_matsui: @ChoaUtatane yeah it's about finding the right group and the right pace
[0:42:27] ashara_matsui: some people need to wipe to a mechanic 5 times to have it click
[0:42:31] ashara_matsui: some people need 100 times
[0:42:34] ashara_matsui: lol
[0:43:05] StreamStickers: Get in on the action by slapping a Stream Sticker! Type !stickers to learn how.
[0:43:52] dbn117: @xd_danteus Thx a lot I will try it ofc but can you tell me how was this DPS not enough they where all alive the hole fight
[0:44:09] ChoaUtatane: yah it is what it is
[0:44:28] Fabiruchix: xddArrive
[0:44:46] ChoaUtatane: @dbn117 top dps check is not that bad, the mechanic execution is more important
[0:44:58] ChoaUtatane: as you get more used to seeing the mechs the dps will follow
[0:45:00] notbaro1: @dbn117 The DPS will come. Just need to get through the mechanic consistently.
[0:45:12] xd_danteus: @dbn117 Hmm just because everyone is alive doesn't mean enrage won't happen. Sometimes people lose uptime, sometimes crit variance is SUPER low, and sometimes some people forget their armor is broken :)
[0:45:26] xd_danteus: Things happen
[0:45:45] ChoaUtatane: yeah but its better to see enrage than to die to mechanics and never see enrage lol
[0:45:46] Fallen_Ra1n: @xd_danteus 8 people having bad crit variance is so incredibly unlikely
[0:45:53] Fallen_Ra1n: in this case is just people not doing enough dmg
[0:45:55] MasameC: xffing
[0:46:01] dbn117: @xd_danteus I see thx a lot ^^
[0:46:18] Fallen_Ra1n: especially with sch*
[0:46:25] ashara_matsui: Momo had a very good twitter post a couple months back with a ton of graphs and data to show that crit variance is not why people enrage
[0:46:28] ashara_matsui: like 99% of the time
[0:46:30] Fabiruchix: fppongSit
[0:46:35] xd_danteus: I don't disagree.
[0:47:13] StreamElements: Check out my wishlist at https://jointhrone.com/arthars REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE GIFTS artharsPrayge
[0:47:24] xd_danteus: Crit variance being the reason is very unlikely absolutely. Never gonna deny that
[0:48:31] ashara_matsui: Mhm it's more like, people messed up 1 or 2 GCDs and think "well its only 2 GCDs" but 1-2 messups from half the people is enough ta do it

[0:49:29] Fallen_Ra1n: top 6.5 enrage check isn't difficult anymore
[0:49:54] ashara_matsui: oh ya, forgot that lol
