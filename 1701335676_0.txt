[1:53:05] Sollice: @osheait Your a littlle late friend
[1:53:06] s7wede: Valor should be capped during RWF to discourage degenerate gameplay but after 3 weeks it should be uncapped for everybody so it doesn't feel horrible to cap it after 4 dungeons knowing the next 4 are a waste apart from the slot in the vault

[2:58:40] DoughBoi_Trev: towNut3 towNut1 towNut2 towNut3 towNut1 towNut2
[2:58:49] Dragunstorm15: dh got nerfed
[2:58:50] LordOfDread: Dks need more power lol
[2:59:27] TacDuc: The MW buffs, atleast from what I've seen doesn't seem too impactful. It helps a bit, but it doesn't even seem to be on par with other top healers (Also R.I.P. Resto Shaman)
[2:59:28] SSD511_: Ret buff ?
[2:59:32] manmower: right now everything is OP
[2:59:45] Masqerader: but they also like oh btw "bird boss"  enjoy!!!
[3:00:01] biggielev: How do you get that dragon?
[3:00:03] im_capy: Blizz doing all these new things like buffing Ret
[3:00:03] cknation23: is there a site to see all changes?
[3:00:09] PidiaP: Devasation buffs towBlack
[3:00:10] Masqerader: Ret went from old school wheelchair to motorized
[3:00:16] pavepawns: rets buffs were like 40% 15% 10% and 15 sec cd off shielf vengenace
[3:00:16] SSD511_: Wow
[3:00:28] Alexm305: true
[3:00:29] Whoracle1337: also WW single target
[3:00:29] PidiaP: Resto is a dead spec
[3:00:31] LeDerpski: Because they dont play the same
[3:00:31] DoughBoi_Trev: @crispymarch ret got the biggest buffs and we are getting rotational rework
[3:00:34] abracka_: resto sham just doesn't exist anymore
[3:00:39] Nebulizer87: That’s is every healer right now
[3:00:41] manmower: now they just need to tune down ret burst and movement
[3:00:42] DoughBoi_Trev: and the largest buff is a 40% damage increase
[3:00:51] Nebulizer87: Either buff all or nerf voker
[3:00:54] PidiaP: Preservation mastery is literally what if resto shaman mastery was actually good
[3:00:54] ShadesOBlue: same
[3:00:54] dalgress: can you get raid gear from vault weekly?
[3:00:59] tenaja22: just switch to Pevoker as a healer, i have no idea what im doing, im just pressing buttons and my hps is amazing.
[3:00:59] gzus81: resto shaman needs an overhaul
[3:01:00] brozzy: wind rush totem is OP Kappa Kappa
[3:01:01] TacDuc: Evoker Mastery is just a better Resto Shaman mastery
[3:01:06] Nebulizer87: Brainless spell does like 90k hps
[3:01:07] peinen: @Towelliee what about how much boomkins whined in the beta about being gimped and yet here we are again, SoD 2.0
[3:01:10] pereadin: giving evokers lust was the death of rsham
[3:01:15] Lilurrn: healing has to be harder than previous expansions though because you can spot out a good and bad healer much quicker now
[3:01:27] SVVGordon: part of that is survivor bias, you're only seeing the die hards and goood shamans remain
[3:01:32] BowSec: My adhd can’t handle everything on your UI lol towBlind
[3:01:55] PidiaP: Resto shaman needs a mastery that isn’t ass
[3:01:56] Masqerader: now if they would just buff drums
[3:01:59] BowSec: There’s more
[3:02:00] abracka_: adderall prescription ran out
[3:02:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are worse UI's out there lol
[3:02:10] Alexm305: idk but I have to say it as a healer I think bfa s1 was harder but I maybe was way worse then
[3:02:21] SpoofAvatar: SpoofAvatar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Congratulations
[3:02:21] tenaja22: Only way to fix Shamans at this point: Give them a elemental infused tank class with Thrall coming back as the herald of all Tanks. Biggest fix.
[3:02:23] SpoofAvatar: Congratulations
[3:02:24] pereadin: @PidiaP could say the same thing about holy paladin
[3:02:30] Raxxiety: @Towelliee does the Tama's WA go away in combat?
[3:02:39] Masqerader: Sco back in the day had the worst, no clue what was happening on his screen LOL
[3:02:45] BowSec: Love you mate. Not a criticism just me me problem

[3:03:23] MrXalon: can a mod lin k me the WA for that profession weeklies???

[3:03:57] Masqerader: the gap this season is the distance between you and the person u need to clear with this season
[3:03:59] PidiaP: @pereadin but like holy paladin mastery does well for their role as melee healers, I get that it sucks in dungeons but all healer masteries do in dungeons. Resto shamans mastery is so bad in raid and preservation is just a better version of their mastery.
[3:04:01] sakura_2020: @mrxalon this one? https://wago.io/9MpDLGWp3
[3:04:02] Nebulizer87: *vokers

[3:04:16] TakeThatBack: I know im bad so i dont do keys ;/
[3:04:26] TakeThatBack: But atleast i like top 200 normal evoker healer Kappa
[3:04:29] Alexm305: same a little for evoker but its mostly on positioning dream breath goes hard
[3:04:30] PidiaP: They removed all the OP resto shaman borrowed power offensive and then didn’t compensate them with healing
[3:04:32] TakeThatBack: im*
[3:04:35] dalgress: can you get raid gear from weekly vaults?
[3:04:39] GreenyFeeny: what class is the best healers currently in DF?
[3:04:39] Nebulizer87: Also once they nerf chill pots RIP melee pally
[3:04:43] WhiteKnight74648: I didn't make the cut Sadge :(
[3:04:51] Masqerader: can paralyze rop it?
[3:04:56] MrXalon: @sakura_2020 no i have that 1..it was under that for professions knolage
[3:04:56] tenaja22: evoker buffs so hawt tho 230% crit, sheesh
[3:05:02] Eazee_: I got tier piece from mythic + in weekly vault
[3:05:07] Aegllor: @sinofasin I've gotten tier gier from m+ slots in the vault
[3:05:10] DinoBornX: @sinofasin do you mean teir gear?
[3:05:17] hawk4gaming: @sinofasin It is possible to get tier gear from just running M+'s
[3:05:17] Masqerader: ah true
[3:05:27] SiriusNick: I just learned about the truthguard trick to find the impostor in court of stars. is it common knowledge?

[3:05:57] gharsely: @Towelliee  can we watch your keyboard in this dungeon?
[3:06:06] Frenaris: last night it activated for me with only 1 clue
[3:06:21] WhiteKnight74648: right
[3:06:24] Masqerader: it did
[3:06:24] Whoracle1337: yes
[3:06:28] WhiteKnight74648: it use to be that way
[3:06:29] DinoBornX: @sinofasin huh? this has been a thing for quiet some time
[3:06:34] TheItalianStallion321: you needed at least 4 clues to use spectral sight i think
[3:06:37] Masqerader: now u need to play blues clues
[3:06:48] dalgress: @DinoBornX i havent played since legion
[3:06:55] im_capy: hand fetish  towLewd

[3:07:05] Cabbageman007: Did you stay at a Disney Themed Hotel?
[3:07:05] s7wede: I like that things do work to make it easy but you still need to to the mechanic. It's QOL instead of a straight out cheese
[3:07:05] KralYoshii: @Towelliee do you have to have truthguard with you?
[3:07:11] verdant85: verdant85 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months!

[3:42:39] kronospally19: @Roenoake I think paladins are comparable to a prot warrior. In most cases, I feel like i do more damage than a prot warrior in keys and have better mitigation on pull. plus have better self heals and stops for mobs. A lot of the top tanks in M+ have been talking that prot warriors aren't as good as everyone is projecting them to be
[3:42:59] ArchMystery: so many class tune ups
[3:45:37] The_Yonaz: @Rudric_Ice Xyronic did a 16 key with a retri, and he did actually quite good. There is hope for a good comeback!

[4:16:58] Masqerader: @spiritXC who told u that "some guy on the internet"
[4:16:59] Sollice: I can tell you exactly why it doesnt resub
[4:17:02] firewalltwitch: for how many people get amazon prime and use twitch they are losing a ton lol
[4:17:21] Sollice: Its because they dont want to deal with people putting in support tickets " My prime autorenewed on someone who I didn't want to ' please fix
[4:17:22] grevant: Not to mention it brings people to Twitch, they get one sub, and if they branch out they spend money or deal with watching ads.
[4:17:25] Sollice: Thats all there is to it
[4:17:28] Hammerify: the average prime sub user probably only uses 60% of the subs when you take into account the fact that they don't auto-renew
[4:17:38] firewalltwitch: they re losing a boat load on subs
[4:17:38] Lulaboo: @nedzalife Alexa is ahuge money maker because Alexa helps collect data on users that they can use for advertisements or just sell to other advertisers
[4:18:03] Molvonos: Some of ya'll aren't thinking about the backend stuff going on, like @Lulaboo just mentioned, for starters.
[4:18:04] Lulaboo: or just sell your preferences to whoever wants it
[4:18:35] Sollice: No No Amazon would never do that! They are not an evil overlord company!
[4:18:42] 1llum1n471: The person saying Amazon is losing money must not know Amazon owns twitch... lol
[4:19:03] Molvonos: @nedzalife link?

[4:19:13] inj0shwetrust: Speaking of primes
[4:19:27] Sollice: @nedzalife devices NEVER make money. Look at any console, or similar device. they sell you the hardware to sell you the software, and put you in the eco system

[4:44:20] Masqerader: for me mission table was except when Blizzard made it part of the story and we had those 12hr to 24hr missions
[4:44:24] nihilistic_bat: 10k gold lmao
[4:44:27] ShadesOBlue: instead of the buggy climbing crap

[4:52:57] mavericks312: if bears fans think fields is the problem there morons
[4:53:07] BobLongMVP: At this point it’s 100% obvious it’s intentional and they just want to see everyone’s reactions
[4:53:08] SaltyTunapants: @Towelliee maybe they are working on tech to look what the person has and determine if they should be allowed to roll on it.
[4:53:08] devoted_bee: Losing the rare fire ring in LFR to a rogue who cant even proc it felt bad
[4:53:28] akia03: got 2 tier tokens from 1 boss
[4:53:31] Purplous: Then they try and sell the other tokens =D

[4:53:48] lovemymage: @devoted_bee rogues can proc it with crafted gear
[4:53:50] akia03: @devoted_bee every class can proc it
[4:53:50] StevoSupremo: I ran both lfr rings and every time I rolled on an item I got the same roll number in both wings. 73 everytime. seemed fishy

[4:54:21] Beans2b: Im sooo unlucky for loot, our heroic pug a DK got 3 pieces of my tier.
[4:54:22] GingerGambit: I’m 12/12 for life on my two characters and haven’t been able to get a drop
[4:54:28] Fedratsailor: as someone who decided to scale back in DF, ill need the F out of LFR since thats all im going to raid for now.
[4:54:31] DinoBornX: @SaltyTunapants luckily its just an alt but my warrior is like 0/14 bosses lol
[4:54:36] theDirtyon3: do you get primal chaos from lfr?
[4:54:42] Hamners: but dont world boss rares drop higher gear than lfr?
[4:54:44] pereadin: doing more keys?
[4:54:45] BobLongMVP: That’s a very logical take towelliee, I’d agree 100%
[4:54:55] Fedratsailor: you do get primal from LFR
[4:54:56] Razznab: i need everything in lfr even if its below me, too many people win with 402 ilvl slotted
[4:55:18] BobLongMVP: @hamners they do, problem is the rares are only up for 30 sec or so and they’re dead

[5:39:29] kogerah_: SL was the last straw for a lot of people
[5:39:33] SleStraA: oooopsa
[5:39:35] KingSlayerYotam: Idk DF feels harder to play tbh, SL was way easier to get into pvp and m+

[5:39:38] ArcaneMaki: The Shadowlands initial Cinematic was a huge BAIT with IceCrown Citadel

[6:48:28] GingerGambit: Hopefully seahawks can pull a rabbit out of their ass with the pick
[6:48:42] Fedratsailor: ^
[6:48:46] nclemen24: @Towelliee Texans Bears Seahawks Cardinals Colts Lions
[6:48:51] Sykum: Bears definitely gonna trade down
[6:49:01] Rakim88: u will
[6:49:09] theDirtyon3: lose their QB and have a chance to draft another franchise QB within a year... Seahawks won that trade HUGE
[6:49:14] Rakim88: 5 or 6 qbs this draft
[6:49:15] bigstick258: youre going to get Levis lmfao
[6:49:16] TheOGDaywalker: Bryce way overrated
[6:49:31] Fedratsailor: seattle is know for trading down picks in the first round, but with the 3rd im not sure they will with that pick.
[6:49:35] NetherRegion: I cant see SEA staying with Geno
[6:49:47] Fedratsailor: ^
[6:49:48] Broomba: texans 24 colts 14
[6:49:49] TheOGDaywalker: people are sleeping on Bijan Robinson
[6:49:55] Daismoon: @Towelliee ...Houston is actually trying to win...The bastards
[6:50:06] TheOGDaywalker: id take Bijan over both those QB's
[6:50:12] Fedratsailor: geno did ok this year but he is not a franchise player
[6:50:23] Rakim88: @TheOGDaywalker i mean he is the #1 RB but still rb in draft that doesnt value rb anymore
[6:50:32] calvine33: As a hawks fan I think it’s more likely we don’t go qb. Geno did well (not great) and I bet Pete wants to focus elsewhere sadly
[6:50:33] johnbacon9: towel what happened to the group
[6:50:35] calvine33: Hope I’m wrong
[6:50:51] Artiiz: is that a weakaura for CallToArms?

[6:51:58] TheOGDaywalker: @Rakim88 true, I guess teams doing the running back committee more. Relying on receivers
[6:52:08] Shugnight: like 26 lol
[6:52:28] theDirtyon3: no shot
[6:52:30] GingerGambit: normal tree is a joke
[6:52:33] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[6:52:36] Rakim88: @TheOGDaywalker pretty much, but bijan might go late ish 1st round experts believe still
[6:52:39] Skylin3r: So what weapon enchant should i spec into
[6:53:26] kranztheman: thats great...lol
[6:53:53] aidonn: and people talk about warrior tank

[11:47:44] temp3st98: a bit off nostalgia sits in everyone of us
[11:47:44] Gingerprimer: The dungeons this expansion is good they are just way harder than the returning ones
[11:47:48] evnaae: CoS is actually fun tho
[11:47:56] radkkos: if only you could build your score around 1 single dungeon
[11:47:57] Kelticlore: Imagine if they added the ICC or the Hour of Twilight dungeon chains to the Keys
[11:47:57] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[11:47:58] Cello_73: @Jarlan23 impossible for sure, that or they quit after one wipe
[11:48:00] radkkos: rofl
[11:48:07] Baron_Pandacula: CoS is to me the least fun dungeon in the rotation i hate it
[11:48:09] thasthebear: If you just want the primal/concentrated primals is there a reason to do anything other than SBG?
[11:48:17] Crowargus: i never do my own keys i just pug keys i want for gear
[11:48:25] Kaype92: Azure Vaults is the worst. You basically have to have at least 1 ranged dps for that stupid last boss
[11:48:28] MightyGIGACHAD: HoV is a super fun dungeon
[11:48:45] Snabido: @Kelticlore Feel like they're too old and clunky, prolly a nightmare to code
[11:48:45] ChalupaBatman25: honestly the only m+ i dread doing is ruby life pools. the rest i don't mind doing tbh
[11:48:58] Jarlan23: i think azure mostly feels fine now except for the last boss
[11:48:58] ohnot___her: im jus shokced CoS is in the rotation w/ how often weve had legion tw
[11:49:11] Shrenko: bosses in pools sucks
[11:49:18] The_Marijuana_NA: azure vault is so shit
[11:49:18] Crowargus: i found cos is my fav i never didnt it in legion on higher keys
[11:49:20] charlie_the_snowman: They should go back to the cata pre-nerf style dungeons  (4.0.6 content)
[11:49:26] Crowargus: did it**
[11:49:46] Gingerprimer: @OHHNOTHER very few pp actually did Legion TW
[11:49:48] Kelticlore: @Snabido maybe but just be funny people getting a key for the first one and each time the key was compeleted there next key was for the next dungeon in the chain
[11:49:52] Jarlan23: nah i have way more trouble with the last boss in ruby. the fire pools dont get controlled or blown off ever
[11:49:53] darkdestroz: @Towelliee Darkmech had a situation that he was in jade temple on m+ and a person left, and it was the 2nd time, in the same fking dungeon XD,
[11:49:56] bvbdragon: cos sucks becaues of the shit b4 last boss
[11:50:09] greentechx: so many of the DF dugeons have like tons of AOE damage for healers
[11:50:52] Kelloggs9: its interesting how theres such a strong consensus that these xpac of dungeons suck
[11:50:58] Gingerprimer: COS is free if you know what to/how to the courtyard
[11:50:59] Blasphehmy: is mage tower time walking up?
[11:51:07] Kelloggs9: dont remember there ever being such a unanimous understanding about new dungeons

[11:51:10] ArcaneMaki: Except 2 dungeons (Halls of Infusion and Neltharus, the new dungeons just re-use the outdoors regions so it's a bit lazy to me. AV and Uldaman are almost re-use from previous dungeons.
[11:51:19] Blasphehmy: oh wait this is WoD timewalking
[11:51:43] Kelticlore: @Blasphehmy yea
[11:52:03] Kelticlore: Towllie which WOD raid would you like to see added to WOD timewalking
[11:52:08] Jarlan23: whats in s2 of df? brackenhide, infusion, neltharians laier whats the last one
[11:52:24] Baron_Pandacula: i think you misread the comment towel

[11:53:04] Baron_Pandacula: what does Av mimic?
[11:53:23] ArcaneMaki: AV is almost the Nexus
[11:53:45] Baron_Pandacula: i think thats a bit of a stretch compared to the other dungeons
[11:53:45] charlie_the_snowman: Any opinion on Packers Lions? @towel
[11:53:54] Snabido: I get the inspired part, but not a copy/paste thing
[11:54:19] dodgerslim: f them birds

[11:55:16] Foxdoabarrelrofl: dont matter niners gonna fuck either of them up
[11:55:19] Foxdoabarrelrofl: hawks or packers
[11:55:20] ArcaneMaki: My point was most exception before, dungeons are brand new interiors, this xpac, Bracken, AA, RLP and Nokgud are just re-using the outside region that already existed. Just not as exciting to me :)
[11:55:20] flyingmachin3: look at lfg
[11:55:37] charlie_the_snowman: @Foxdoabarrelrofl packers
[11:55:40] flyingmachin3: so 7 mins
[11:56:01] bingshillin: guys whats the overall valor cap rn?

[11:56:23] JReal3: refs screwed us lions and the game is just started. now we play spoiler to the packers
[11:56:24] Uglyfoot: with the pug
[11:56:25] STRIK3R155: 3750
[11:56:27] Uglyfoot: pet
[11:56:30] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Charlie_The_Snowman neither team scares me
[11:56:33] Baron_Pandacula: @SollowJP i completely agree with you however
[11:56:37] LspN: @bingshillin 3750
[11:57:21] Sadisticmedic: Eagles per the NBC computer is a 31% chance to get to the Super bowl Chiefs are 41 %
[11:57:23] balerrionhunt: Gratz on the engagement!

[11:59:10] Bedpan_BoB: Chiefs looked good last year too
[11:59:12] ChalupaBatman25: i think the sb is going to be chiefs/bills vs 49ers
[11:59:13] hollywood__cole: The Niners are pretty awesome
[11:59:17] NetherRegion: 9ers and Cincy
[11:59:24] bingshillin: yeah im convinced 49ers are gonna sneak their way through
[11:59:38] charlie_the_snowman: I could see 49ers in finals
[11:59:38] theDirtyon3: lmao
[11:59:52] TarMonA: a shomething
[12:00:05] OldManMaple: yeah Aerie peak has multiple 20+ keys up to join
[12:00:10] ChalupaBatman25: @bingshillin is it really sneaking when outside of the QB position they probably have the best rotation from top to bottom?
[12:00:26] TarMonA: a somthing**
[12:00:48] TarMonA: Azgalor
[12:01:24] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @ChalupaBatman25 purdy has statistically been a top 5 qb fwiw lol

[12:01:35] thasthebear: I started on Azgalor.  New Player Server
[12:02:02] TarMonA: it a "full" server but no one plays on it
[12:02:04] ChalupaBatman25: @Foxdoabarrelrofl well when i meant besides QB position i meant he's just unproven but he's looked really good
[12:02:13] bingshillin: @ChalupaBatman25 what good teams have they played other than dolphins & chiefs?
[12:02:17] TarMonA: it only one person
[12:02:17] Cloudedrogue: Does anyone know if you can change professions and still access the research books from the artisans consortium for the profession learned?

[15:07:37] Fedratsailor: im a seahawks fan, won't lie when they initially traded wilson, most hawks fans were like WTF.  that trade turned out to be one of the best the team could have made.

[15:09:56] Broomba: as usual the gm and owner of texans are literally destroying the franchise if its not dead yet, its on its last legs
[15:10:28] c0mmander_starscream: Yeah, Rodgers just needs to hang it up
[15:10:35] Rakim88: @mavericks312 why not both? still possible to trade down n get an elite pass rusher. 2 in this draft will anderson from bama n jalen carter from georgia
[15:10:44] mavericks312: nah there gonna have to cut ryan and eat his contract

[15:11:43] Uberhub: If Rogers retires, what will the Pack do? 30+ years of having elite QB's. It would be nice to see them tank for 10+ years.
[15:11:46] Rakim88: @Broomba i meant his old team the bears. lovie was their coach before

[15:59:24] Pitho_o: did you guys do fire first here?
[15:59:25] Talason: windgoal not activating
[15:59:32] Pitho_o: red - wind usually trigger the bug
[15:59:33] magemaster225: something about wiping once with the wind you cant do it again
[15:59:42] Surren22: If you wipe by using fire first, you cannot activate wind on the 2nd attempt
[15:59:46] ThorH13: After Fire is engaged the goals towards the Wind is not counting
[16:00:32] Krimsonz23: I wasn’t able to do the wind on the first attempt period. I didn’t wipe and I still wasn’t able to use it
[16:00:47] ThorH13: why is the time for the Tree ?
[16:01:25] Surren22: Going in on the 2nd try and using wind goal first is really fun
[16:01:25] Pitho_o: @Krimsonz23 its like Thor said, if you use fire first, then wind will not count the balls. Doing wind first will let you do both wind and fire
[16:01:37] Surren22: Makes the boss into a literaly hardmode
[16:02:33] mozavich: working as intended
[16:02:45] Krimsonz23: @pitho_o that’s possible didn’t do wind first but I do know doing fire first bugs out the wind even on the first attempt
[16:03:08] bvbdragon: last boss is a joke
