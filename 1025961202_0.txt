[0:56:33] Lulaboo: @MetallicusGaming THANK YOUUUU
[0:56:36] BTiZZY_: wildstar btizzyHype btizzyHype
[0:56:55] Shrenko: @MetallicusGaming doesnt 1-20 stay the same?
[0:56:55] smashwow: wildstar? where? don't mess with my heart like that
[0:57:15] hman1717: i might boost to 58 tommorow and then hit 60 then when im 60 do some gdkp runs to get some starter gear for tbc
[0:57:33] SonofHorus82: no not like that. I meant I thought I saw our raid times were on like thursdays or something. I might just be finally loosing my mind.

[0:57:50] NazmoJenkinz: anyone know if boosts come out tomorrow or TBC release?
[0:57:50] raymond3195: aoe
[0:57:53] a_demeaning_cow: I really would've liked 4 weeks of pre patch personally
[0:58:02] SonofHorus82: That's probably where I got confused.
[0:58:11] NazmoJenkinz: sweet thx @Towelliee
[0:58:11] Alepouditsa: you can't copy to tbc a lvl 40 caracter only 60?
[0:58:23] Nalleys: Oh boy, Classic store mounts  DansGame
[0:58:48] hman1717: what should i boost tommorow?
[0:58:58] nightmayor12: correct you have to be 60 to clone
[0:58:58] Smilesome: warlock or hunter
[0:58:59] Broomba: you can
[0:59:00] MrSnekyDino: You don't copy TO BC. Everything is moved to BC, you can pay to copy to classic or choose to lock a character to classic.
[0:59:01] Padarius: i'm just ready for tokens to be a thing in BC
[0:59:16] Shrenko: this is still confusing people ðŸ˜‚
[0:59:26] Aidler: I hope the retail mount will be available seperately later on
[0:59:34] stackopancakes: @Towelliee what class you playing during prepatch
[0:59:36] Broomba: @Shrenko i know this was announced back in february
[0:59:46] SonofHorus82: for the love of god... You are not copying your character to TBC servers. The existing servers are naturally progressing to TBC, just like every other xpac that has ever been released.
[1:00:00] gidgeet: it's gonna be a shitshow lol
[1:00:01] hman1717: if i go bc can i still do classic raiding till tbc drops?
[1:00:02] Berexios123: $$$ when people mess it up
[1:00:05] Shrenko: @Broomba yep it is abit confusing still
[1:00:07] Alepouditsa: @MrSnekyDino meh that what i mean copy
[1:00:08] Padarius: does the levling become "quicker" for 1-58 starting tomorrow?
[1:00:10] MrSnekyDino: They shouldn't have made it an option at all to stay in classic
[1:00:11] Brodih_: or they will think they can pick Classic and pay after to clone to TBC
[1:00:14] TombStoneMercenary: At this point people are just looking for reasons to complain!
[1:00:35] a_joc: are you cloning any toons? @Towelliee
[1:00:37] MackAttack1421: Is Find Fish in WoW classic or TBC?
[1:00:37] Exusprime: @SonofHorus82 so what you're saying is when i put my TBC CD into the CD rom drive LUL
[1:00:41] dracullus: are you sure? yep ARE YOU SURE??? YEP. REALLY??? YEP ok Classic Era 'fucking Blizzard'
[1:00:43] valth: can't wait tomorrow Valth gets benched and i start leveling the new BE hunter
[1:00:43] Broomba: @Shrenko not really, you chose classic or bc, or copy character to both pay 15
[1:00:44] Collected1: Padarius : yes. Differences start at level 20.
[1:00:48] a_joc: same
[1:00:58] mathiaschance12: lol
[1:01:04] doller05: @Towelliee are we going to be able to use a boost tomorrow
[1:01:10] a_joc: it was good for nostalgia in patch 1/2 thats about it
[1:01:18] hman1717: if i boost tommorw and choose tbc can i still play my toon on prepatch and raid?
[1:01:33] MetallicusGaming: what you gonna do on classic? play cards with the other 3 ppl? Kappa
[1:01:35] SonofHorus82: @Exusprime yes that is 100% what I am saying. LUL
[1:01:39] VladVolynine: @hman1717 you dont "choose" tbc
[1:01:40] youngpandalul: so you not cloning anymore?
[1:01:59] Shrenko: @Broomba yes I know but for people who just are coming back when they knew BC comes out, they wiill be confused on what the copy for 15$ is xD
[1:02:04] Broomba: yes not bc content @hman1717
[1:02:15] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee for me, Orc Shaman or Undead Priest?
[1:02:19] krakken172: Will you have to pay for boost tomorrow?
[1:02:20] Nalleys: LUL
[1:02:22] a_joc: trueee

[1:02:58] MetallicusGaming: "can't go through the dark portal, think it's bugged"

[1:03:43] Vladeimir: customer is always right
[1:03:47] Broomba: inc 10000 open tickets to blizzard -- dark portal broken -- small indie company
[1:04:15] 210Crawler: I highly doubt it

[1:04:45] Shrenko: buy a copy just to see how empty Stormwind is tomorrow @Towelliee
[1:04:49] Bixster: i mean what are players going to do in classic. keep farming naxx for luls?
[1:05:01] Broomba: @SonofHorus82 then make "content videos" afterwards
[1:05:13] BDivinny: I know I'm probably wayyyy late but is this the new steam room? did you post any pictures on socials of it??

[1:07:11] indestructible123: Is the lvl 58 boost is available tomorrow?
[1:07:13] SonofHorus82: also considering making my belf and letting her sit until wednesday when I get back from my vacc and focusing on getting whatever I boost to 60 tomorrow evening.

[1:07:29] k1ngtmac: @indestructible123 yes
[1:07:37] indestructible123: Thanks
[1:08:01] RogueBear: the way it sounded to me is the switch to BC is automatic and to stay in classic you're doing a transfer type thing?
[1:08:10] SonofHorus82: What's project 60?
[1:08:27] HaCKeD_S14: I think the boosting helps also with people quitting due to the massive undertaking of 1-60 that are new to Vanilla
[1:08:27] Broomba: @RogueBear nope -- you choose bc or classic and pay 15 to play both
[1:08:49] Sir_Kalabad: wasnt it ungoro and ws for thorium?

I was wondering if itâ€™s worth starting this late into it. I love the graphics and art style. I want to play TBC too but should I just grind until 58-60 or boost ?
[1:17:14] Nuggsz: just hope I can get to 60 on time
[1:17:20] RayRay_wow: I don't mind Ff14,  it has a good draw in its story but it has it's fair share of faults, that just seem ignored whenever FF14 is brought up elsewhere.
[1:17:35] BTiZZY_: @remyboygaming never a better time to hop in. just boost a char

[1:28:07] cbiskit89: i cannot imagine asmon's community sitting through ff14 cutscenes
[1:28:09] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee Hey there is a great idea for him to do and then people will stop bugging him about it finally lol
[1:28:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: @cbiskit89 wouldn't be much different then it is now

[1:29:22] gidgeet: reddit is a cesspool of hate for most things except the Doge community lol
[1:29:26] Shrenko: New World made some really bad comments on Twitter @Towelliee really puts them in a bad spotlight
[1:29:28] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee unless they post a 3000 word essay about how the game is an AI in disguise to track women's menstrual cycle than it isnt as bad as the anthem sub.
[1:29:44] Z3r0Fear: @Shrenko What comments did they make?
[1:30:11] Slugginattor: is 27-60 possible in pre patch
[1:30:29] MetallicusGaming: Hubs532 yes
[1:30:39] Collected1: Hubs532 : without boosting? put a sleeping bag under your desk.
[1:30:44] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee That guy is a piece of work in my opinion.
[1:30:45] theegoomba: pot callin kettle
[1:30:58] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee 500$ for an alpha they keep delaying.
[1:31:08] Hazno: sooo.. Star Citizen? LUL
[1:31:12] Moronil: I just wish the MMO community can respect each at the end of the day. No need to call each other "weebs" or unnecesary names. It's just games.
[1:31:16] Broomba: bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir bogaSir
[1:31:50] ofnaldreya: Steven has created such an insane narrative around AOTC that people bend over backwards to ignore its grossly suspect monetisation because its seen as the holy grail
[1:32:08] Shrenko: @Z3r0Fear they autoreplied to comments in the tweet where they basically was trying to come up with excuses for the store. they are really out of the loop

[1:32:10] RayRay_wow: its probably all the replies the new world twtiter account did.
[1:32:13] MrGattz: as long as there is no crafting boost, xp boost or otherwise pay to progress items ever.
[1:32:20] Z3r0Fear: @ofnaldreya dont even get me started on that guy he seriously has a massive EGO.
[1:32:38] ijuki: @MrGattz check 3rd paragraph Kappa
[1:32:56] Shrenko: they have some bad replies in that tweet too @Towelliee
[1:33:22] hectabit: lmao
[1:33:25] XshadowturkeyX: new world is adding a boost and telling people that they stand by it and its for peopel that dont have the tiem to lvl but stillwanna play
[1:33:26] MrGattz: so pay to fast travel? what?
[1:33:28] stratiss: People are upset, because they might design the game with annoyances that the store can bypass.
[1:33:28] manmower: there are no monthly sub for this?
[1:33:35] Shrenko: some people come up with good points in those comments
[1:33:42] Collected1: MrGattz : flight paths unlock I guess
[1:33:48] Collected1: similar to the in game wow item but charged
[1:33:58] Draeuzen: No monthly subscription doesn't bode to well for future content. Unfortunate.
[1:34:02] Shrenko: yes but for real money @Collected1 ?!
[1:34:06] manmower: if they dont have a sub, they need to make money for the live service somehow
[1:34:08] Aidler: difference is that there is one mmo currently in production that asmon supports and the other he hates on lately. hmmm naguuraThinking
[1:34:13] Hazno: @MrGattz perhaps consumable items you can purchase in-game and in the store that lets you fast travel?
[1:34:21] Vaedrun: This game will be dead in a year i reckon
[1:34:23] Shrenko: read comments
[1:34:27] GCnT: I think monthly sub would be more welcome than buying XP boosts on the store
[1:34:27] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @robertjordan83 (warning)
[1:34:30] Collected1: Shrenko : yeah I know. but technically you can buy the item in WoW for real money too if you buy gold first.
[1:34:30] Vexxsis: yeah the ordeal with new world atm is like nahh ill pass on that game
[1:34:40] Moronil: @Draeuzen 100%. They should just embrace the sub fee.
[1:34:42] MrGattz: @Hazno i guess. idk. i dont want to come out and complain this early the games not even out yet
[1:34:48] Vexxsis: yeah thats biased af
[1:34:48] MrGattz: ill wait it out and see how it goes
[1:34:51] robertjordan83: @Towelliee i need permission to link the video
[1:34:53] Collected1: i dunno... if folks are cancelling because of the store i'm not sure you were that into the game to begin with. just my 2c worth.
[1:35:00] Draeuzen: @Tuomas_Emissary Yup. This is something I wish Bungie would do with Destiny so we'd get better/more content.
[1:35:03] DallTV_: ashes never come out :P
[1:35:09] Towelliee: !permit robertjordan83
[1:35:09] Moobot: @Towelliee @robertjordan83 will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[1:35:09] Shrenko: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRoYayTU-L4
[1:35:12] Namill: The whole issue is the fact they're invalidating progress with boosts?
[1:35:12] Draeuzen: There's a reason why FFXIV and WoW have a lot of content and that's the subscription fee.
[1:35:13] manmower: should go for a more customer friendly model like Star Citizen
[1:35:13] stratiss: Ashes isn't selling boosts, only cosmetics that's the argument.
[1:35:16] magemaster225: valheim gonna be the real hero when it gets updated
[1:35:18] robertjordan83: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRoYayTU-L4
[1:35:20] Broomba: thats a straight up douche bag hypocrite position
[1:35:23] liberategeorge: the saddest thing is that leveling should be fun in any game
[1:35:26] Hazno: @MrGattz at least that's how it read to me, considering it said it could be purchasable in-game and in the store, but I haven't paid attention to NW or AoC at all, so I have no idea
[1:35:26] duecesx32: @DallDK TRUE
[1:35:27] GCnT: Ashes of StarCitizen!
[1:35:34] Zkx_: What time does pre patch launch tomo
[1:35:36] feherlofia123: its 2021 , not having a store in game would be an anomaly

[1:36:28] EthicalHermit: Ashes can monetize whatever they want. At this point, they won't announce it because they will get flamed to hell.
[1:36:50] MrGattz: then you just end up with whales overtaking everything that have all the time in the world at their disposal
[1:37:09] solstarz: :P
[1:37:12] NinjaGlovz: Clap Clap Clap

[1:37:22] Gingerprimer: As a catchup mechanic it is fine
[1:37:22] Collected1: people need to remember that. n osub.
[1:37:26] SilkeySmooth: all you care bout is you two months on content out of it
[1:37:28] Exusprime: That tweet was from a PR person who was ask to put out a positive statement. The skill is reading between the lines to understand the intentions.
[1:37:36] Shrenko: New World devs are really out of the loop though with all those comments
[1:37:39] alex12645: yeah there no sub to it
[1:37:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: just don't buy from the cash shop easy
[1:37:55] MrGattz: all i hope is that they know what they are doing.
[1:38:17] manmower: they can't rely on only cosmetics on the shop at the start because that requires popularity to maintain sales
[1:38:30] SilkeySmooth: towelliee is ready to pay for that fast travel option..lmao
[1:38:34] myfunkyself: LUL
[1:38:39] stratiss: Here's the problem Towelliee. These developers create problems  in the game to sell solutions in the store.
[1:38:51] SilkeySmooth: it wil lbe in day one
[1:39:00] Shrenko: @MrGattz I recommend watching that whole video, there is more twitter responses LUL
[1:39:16] Gingerprimer: @manmower ppl do not understand how insanely popular a game has to be for it to be supported with only cosmetics
[1:39:17] Hazno: @Towelliee are the fast travel points free/reusable or consumable items, considering you could buy "fast travel" from the store?
[1:39:27] Namill: Why not remove that gatekeeping instead of charging for it? There are ways of montesing your game apart from shitting on progression

[1:39:32] SilkeySmooth: all you care about is is you two months of content
[1:39:36] Moonori: Tow did you play GW2?
[1:39:58] manmower: @gingerprimer agreed, the developers need to have incoming funds to continue to make the game good, if we cut off all of their funds the game will be dead in the water
[1:39:59] Hazno: iT iNvaLiDaTeS mY PrOgReSs LUL
[1:40:01] Masqerader: the fake outrage is real
[1:40:04] Broomba: in the end everyone gets to the same point -- endgame
[1:40:06] Shrenko: people dont really mind exp boosts in ESO because you can obtain them ingame via drops and crafting them and also because of CP lvl's @Towelliee
[1:40:08] Gingerprimer: @Namill not really if your not a super popular game
[1:40:12] Fortune90: Fortune90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! towHorde

[1:40:36] ChiefMango: wait, do you have a new tattoo, or have i just not seen it before?
[1:40:38] manmower: why are sub costs only $15 a month? been paying the same price for decades
[1:41:00] Broomba: towWipe towWipe towWipe towWipe towWipe
[1:41:00] Namill: @Gingerprimer It's literalyl fucking amazon
[1:41:08] Draeuzen: @Masqerader hopefully the new Battlefield is going to be amazing, been wanting a Bad Company 3 sequel.
[1:41:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: just sell a copy to everyone on earth 4Head
[1:41:10] SilkeySmooth: he still doesnt get it new world is floating p2w in alpha.....the game is dead
[1:41:10] froglok_: Most people I've talked to about this are just mad because they "cant afford" to keep up with people who can. And they can't "keep up" normally because they have the dread fullllllllll time jobbbbbbbbbbbb
[1:41:22] bakkich: well , the mtx in itself is not thre problem , right?
[1:41:30] Alitor1987: Itâ€™s free to play? I thought it had a sub fee
[1:41:32] Gingerprimer: @Namill yeah but Amazon does not make by throwing away cash for nothing on their "projects"
[1:41:36] Gingerprimer: money
[1:41:41] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee I don't have a problem with stores but one thing I really dislike is selling inventory space seriously makes me lose interest in a game quickly.
[1:41:42] alex12645: i seen mmos that free to play and have a cash shop and thats normal
[1:41:44] Broomba: million box sales  god would have created it and blessed with the holy water
[1:41:46] Draeuzen: All the initial sales probably pays back investors. Who knows how much they'll have left to put back into the game.
[1:41:48] manmower: yea, why would Amazon want a game that loses money?
[1:41:55] SilkeySmooth: its the fact they are considering it before its even launched.'
[1:41:57] happybooger: im still undecided if i want to play New World at launch or wait a month or two
[1:42:00] stratiss: Valheim is a good game that sold millions without MTX
[1:42:05] Masqerader: @Draeuzen they're not gonna make a new bad company game because how battlefield is now its like bad company in terms of gameplay style
[1:42:21] MrGattz: @Z3r0Fear yeah i hope not. because all those korean mmos have a massive difference in culture. over there, you could be dead ass broke but own a $250k car because material items are far above everything including your own health.
[1:42:22] Hazno: @stratiss Valheim also doesn't need to have any game servers running at all
[1:42:26] manmower: videogames are still an incredibly cheap leisure activity
[1:42:32] Draeuzen: @Masqerader True. Needs more building desruction/destructible environment and it'll be perfect.
[1:42:39] ChiefMango: they just said xp right, not actually level boost
[1:42:47] SilkeySmooth: new world is done already in most games mind
[1:42:48] Gingerprimer: @manmower no they love throwing away cash for fun because they are rich /s
[1:42:52] RogueBear: but businesses making money is evil and stuff BabyRage
[1:43:02] liberategeorge: AngelThump
[1:43:03] Draeuzen: @Masqerader did you get a chance to play BF 2142? Something like that would be cool too.
[1:43:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: fuck you pay me
[1:43:20] Artivicii: towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout
[1:43:21] MrGattz: @HaxzorJimDuggan basically lol
[1:43:21] stratiss: @Hazno That is true, I support a sub price for this reason. My point is that a great game will make money.
[1:43:30] Z3r0Fear: @MrGattz It just seems like it from all the MMORPGs I've played over the years. I just hope they don't make it as bad here as it is over there
[1:43:30] bakkich: cant it be a middleground somewhere?
[1:43:45] SilkeySmooth: ashes of creation has already responded yo new world..lol
[1:43:46] Draeuzen: Star Citizen of MMOs
[1:43:49] Gameriders: wow makes way too much money for survival, but the content is poor
[1:43:49] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee Like ppl do not understand how expensive games  are to make
[1:43:51] manmower: if Amazon was smart, they should start buying the other MMOs out there and canceling them, clear the field
[1:43:54] alex12645: thos server are not easy to run they have repair cost and people watching them
[1:43:58] Aidler: your parents payed for the games you played when you were 10 years old towLul
[1:44:05] bakkich: yeah, i guess. the store in it self is not the problem imo
[1:44:17] Hazno: @stratiss of course, initially it will, but the maintenance cost for New World is FAR greater than the minimal maintenance cost for Valheim, so you can't really compare the two
[1:44:24] Z3r0Fear: @MrGattz I HATE when they sell inventory space in the games honestly I won't play it once I figure it out that happens.
[1:44:29] froglok_: The same people who bitch about companies making money are the same people who bitch about sub costs and boosts and blah blah blah. They are just jaded people who can't accept other people will have more or better things \
[1:44:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: Star Citizen has a $1100 package LUL
[1:44:35] Collected1: Amazon should just say "Ok no store? Sure. $14.99 per month please". Let's see the reaction to that.
[1:44:50] MrGattz: @Z3r0Fear oh yeah. any game that sells bag space for irl money can just go fuck themselves.
[1:44:51] Darkaon: Id rather pay monthly then have a store
[1:44:53] Spawn83s: o man i didnt play this game for a long time....
[1:44:54] AveragePvp: @manmower monopolize the mmo market like they did the real life market hahahahaha
[1:45:01] biirrd: @Towelliee Blizzard has said like some years ago that sub money is a net loss, and the money comes from tokens and store. So even the sub in a game is not make it sustain.
[1:45:17] MrGattz: unless there is a way to get bag space with in game farming or something. as long as it doesnt take 100 hours to unlock 1 slot.
[1:45:19] Darkaon: @biirrd Blizzard is full of fucking shit lol
[1:45:37] Draeuzen: @biirrd you can go lookup Blizzard's financial stuff, that statement is not true at all.
[1:45:38] AveragePvp: @haxzorjimduggan for real?
[1:45:39] manmower: @averagepvp Marvel Avengers did that, they killed the other Marvel game to stop the competition
[1:45:45] bakkich: as long as its not enything that gives someone an edge by buying im indifferent
[1:45:47] Gingerprimer: The only goal of a company is to make money
[1:45:50] SilkeySmooth: it doesnt matter how much you defend new world its already done in most games minds over this
[1:45:56] Z3r0Fear: @MrGattz Yeah reason I still play SWTOR from time to time because I can buy it with ingame credits.
[1:45:59] Taco117: Look at mobile mmos all have a cash shop
[1:46:07] Collected1: SilkeySmooth : they'll all be there day 1
[1:46:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: @AveragePvp yeah

[1:46:49] MrGattz: @biirrd i dont believe that for a second, however, blizzard does have like 500 employees. it might be a net loss in revenue but its an investment in other assets.
[1:47:05] mavericks312: new world will do way better then AoC
[1:47:06] SilkeySmooth: i wont be watching anyone playing new world
[1:47:11] TheGaoSora: Play, more like gonna get hard carried LUL
[1:47:14] porowozek: @HaxzorJimDuggan I thought there were even bigger packages. $1100 feels average for Chris' apetite
[1:47:15] Darkaon: @MrGattz I agree there is no way subsricptions from wow is a net loss lmao
[1:47:19] AveragePvp: @mavericks312 LUL
[1:47:29] manmower: if the pvp is good the game will do well
[1:47:35] Shrenko: Amazon have yet to release a successful game
[1:47:35] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:47:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: @porowozek i seem to remember that as well
[1:47:41] Namill: Straight Diarrhoea flooding from your mouth for the last 30 minutes
[1:47:42] stratiss: Honestly though I think the boost isn't what concerns people the most. It's the door it opens. Developers are incentivized to create gameplay loops that are better with store purchases. For example imagine being able to purchase conduit energy or covenant swaps.
[1:47:42] TheGaoSora: not you, asmon lol
[1:48:00] Masqerader: I am not playing New World, not because I like or dislike the game, just gonna be playing other shit till then, catch up on other games I haven't got to play because of WOW
[1:48:08] Draeuzen: What does everyone think about LOTRO coming to next gen consoles in 2021 FIRST before WoW? I'm kinda mad.
[1:48:12] Snomase: I like how Hardcore real @Towelliee  is lol!
[1:48:16] froglok_: You gotta make money to fund the game. Engineers aren't cheap, at all, and the teams aren't like 3 people building the game.
[1:48:22] AveragePvp: I kinda wanna play new world now because of this rage, I havenâ€™t even seen how it plays though hahahah
[1:48:25] Darkaon: Only thing about exp boosts in the store is now you know they made the grind harder to level. Just so people buy the boost
[1:48:30] MrGattz: amazon lotro was canceled yeah
[1:48:31] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee It is cancelled as far as I know.
[1:48:32] Draeuzen: The Amazon game yes, but the old LOTRO is still around.
[1:48:37] Samaellus: It is
[1:48:56] manmower: gotta make those alimony payments somehow
[1:48:56] Masqerader: Amazon LOTR is dead
[1:48:57] Shrenko: old LOTR Online is good
[1:48:58] Artivicii: towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout towSellout
[1:49:01] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee to me I don't mind game stores. To me as long as it has great content and the reward system doesn't suck then I'll play it. The stores doesn't effect me rather I want to play the game or not

[1:49:12] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee like the goal a company is to make money for their shareholders
[1:49:12] Draeuzen: Old LOTRO is getting better graphics and coming to consoles in 2021. Just sucks WoW isn't on console.
[1:49:25] CushyPop: True, devs do what they are directed to do
[1:49:28] Collected1: stratiss : if the level grind needs a boost then yeah, that kinda sucks. but then i remember i'm not paying a sub and decide to spend that sub money on the boost for that month.
[1:49:29] Draeuzen: Yes.
[1:49:33] Shrenko: yes, new engine upgrade
[1:49:33] Z3r0Fear: WHAT?
[1:49:35] AveragePvp: @silkeysmooth you gonna just keep saying that or explain why lmao
[1:49:39] MrGattz: @Draeuzen i would say wow will get console support at 10.0 launch
[1:49:52] Draeuzen: @MrGattz I hope so. There would be millions of new players.
[1:50:00] Darkaon: so true
[1:50:04] magemaster225: te only LOTR game being made is that Gollum game
[1:50:10] MrGattz: @Draeuzen only because wow actually has full controller support atm, its just hidden in the background for people that need accessibility options
[1:50:15] froglok_: Preach it @Towelliee , preach it! Engineers legit just do what their sprint work requires them to do lol.
[1:50:17] Nuggsz: Then they grow up and realize how stupid they were
[1:50:24] Shrenko: nope, nothing yet. the devs that are driving LOTR online are known to be very slow with updates
[1:50:31] rocthenite: who is this kira guy is why is everyone loving him

[1:50:37] XarkoLP: wait the store was not Ion's idea? monkaS
[1:50:49] ClubsSC: I don't get it why are people so mad about there being a cash shop in game. If the game is good why does it matter if they sell extra shit to make money?
[1:50:51] cbiskit89: imagine thinking the dev's do anything other than run down the product manager's agile roadmap

[1:52:24] micahmckittrick: Do we know if the paid TBC boost will be available tomorrow? Or not till launch
[1:52:24] froglok_: @SilkeySmooth I will. I will also enjoy paying for my TBC boosts and multiboxing my own dungeons
[1:52:26] Z3r0Fear: @MrGattz I feel for you man with moderating the interesting people that show up when these discussions start tp happen LOL
[1:52:27] Hazno: people need to get out of their basement more often
[1:52:27] SpoinkJr: Lawyerr Towelliee has entered the chat
[1:52:27] yshtola1337: I am so hyped about bc classic been practing learning what i need to know on private server
[1:52:28] Wildside1177: So many people hate capitalism suddenly. Making money drives the world.
[1:52:28] PokerFaceMoose: people think there is a fight still to be fought, without realizing that fight was lost years ago
[1:52:28] PhillyDilly18: You could trade out what happens at Blizzard to any major corporation. Leader wants something done, person has to get it done.
[1:52:31] MrGattz: ion is over there in his attic nook sitting in his red leather chair jotting down items and ideas on what to add to WoWs store next IonJam
[1:52:33] theegoomba: maximum profit above all has been become the norm over just getting general profit
[1:52:41] micahmckittrick: sweeeeeeeeet! Thanks!
[1:52:44] Nico_vdM: Hating on the devs of a game is the same as hating painters for the colour they're painting a dude's house
[1:52:47] froglok_: @cbiskit89 Lol scrumppppppy poker and JIRA make me want to kill myself
[1:52:50] TheGaoSora: @MrGattz D:
[1:53:05] yshtola1337: i reallyw ish they'd allow paid boost for blood elf and draenei but maybe later down road
[1:53:05] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee  I know so many people want to complain about the stores. If they don't want to buy stuff that is their choice but my choice to buy mounts or other stuff is my choice
[1:53:15] Gingerprimer: @theegoomba nah it is just that the gaming market is way more competitive
[1:53:19] magemaster225: ions guild downed sire, so mythic sire nerfs inc
[1:53:19] Z3r0Fear: @MrGattz You do a great job on here!
[1:53:23] Hazno: @Jaina1337 same
[1:53:31] Broomba: @Wildside1177 its more like a bunch of young 20 year old trying to recapture and relive their past glory days where everything is pure like towelliee said
[1:53:39] liberategeorge: LUL
[1:53:39] cbiskit89: @sixteen_____ the retrospective can be at your funeral

[1:53:50] MrGattz: @Z3r0Fear well thanks! i havnt done anything yet today but so far everyone has been pretty calm and collected :P
[1:53:56] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee can you call ION and ask him to nerf Council
[1:53:59] liberategeorge: i take it "elitist jerks" is the guild name?
[1:54:07] jimmix12: you stil hva to buy BC ??
[1:54:07] manmower: more than 99%
[1:54:10] MrGattz: @liberategeorge it is yes
[1:54:10] rocthenite: more then asmongold
[1:54:13] theegoomba: @Gingerprimer oh im not saying im against it for every game that is like that there are plenty of games that are just about the art of it for people to enjoy so no point in getting outraged over it
[1:54:14] BubbaChubbs420: carried Kappa
[1:54:16] Gingerprimer: @jimmix12 no
[1:54:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: ion is my scarab lord

[1:54:30] TheGaoSora: is one of the sole devs who still play the game lol
[1:54:30] liberategeorge: @MrGattz good to know. it didn't sound very Towellie-eske otherwise
[1:54:31] PokerFaceMoose: @jimmix12 you do not have to buy BC
[1:54:35] jerexify: @jimmix12 You don't have to, no. Only if you want a boost for $40 or the collector's edition with in-game mounts and stuff for $70.
[1:54:45] theegoomba: @Gingerprimer i just meant in the mmo field
[1:54:52] froglok_: The only thing that needs to change about CN is SLG. The fight is fucking trash tier
[1:55:01] ProjectSevan: @Towelliee How bad of an idea is it to want to be a shockadin for TBC?
[1:55:08] yshtola1337: yes you can
[1:55:10] jimmix12: or okay i see thanks @jerexify and @PokerFaceMoose

[1:55:44] Shrenko: he is @stackopancakes
[1:55:47] Secondbreakfasttt: i love that fight
[1:55:49] happybooger: ill take a Council nerf if they are giving them out

[1:57:02] Gotxiko: oribos goes to shite for sure
[1:57:15] Aidler: @PokerFaceMoose maybe some came over from quin69. that was toxic today....
[1:57:15] UNSUNG_HER0: so you leaving this warrior in classic since they are worthless in TBC?
[1:57:23] yshtola1337: im hoping sylvanas wont be killed

[2:09:29] NovaSun84: Ugh, I would hope with how popular Classic was for WoW... maybe NCsoft could re-evaluate what a "private server" tells you... people want to play this shit(And I assume there are thousands on the private server too)

[2:31:10] fat_european0: That's why I dont get the AoC push back. Launching it when the WF race is going on in wow sounds like a bad plan
[2:31:11] NovaSun84: D:
[2:31:16] stratiss: 9.2 ptr august 31st calling it
[2:31:21] NovaSun84: Our GM is leaving BabyRage

[2:32:11] stratiss: hehe they will find something for New World release

[2:32:17] Mystirose: with the new mask off thing won't Blizz staff return to the office soon?
[2:32:53] Gingerprimer: @fat_european0 maybe if they do 9.1.5 a give us them early
[2:33:12] SonofHorus82: @Mystirose depends on state and local health rules as well.
[2:33:30] Aidler: If Ion is fast in the Sylvanas raid this time... 9.2 might still come out in 2021 towLul
[2:33:41] MrEvilRex: I mean other companies have had dev set backs of their own
[2:33:52] Enraig: PTR in november maybe
[2:34:03] Ethrendil: I was basically forced to buy the vanilla wow CE, the normal edition wasn't in stock @.@

[2:34:24] TheItalianStallion321: Wednesday NY is lifting the vaccinated mask mandate
[2:34:30] fat_european0: @Gingerprimer Idk. It would be weird to add two new m+ dungeons in the middle of the season
[2:34:50] CodeJPG: Most of the game studios are on the September or later for offering coming back into the office
[2:34:56] Gingerprimer: @fat_european0 yeah mostly just hoping

[2:40:58] 91Niki: @Bixster I mean, it really depends what it is ofc. But for the most part, those kind of jobs definitely don't benefit from it, yeah
[2:41:09] Gingerprimer: No reason to not have an audience with how many ppl in the USA have gotten the vaccine
[2:41:11] SonofHorus82: @Bixster fact. I do government work and sometimes need instant responses from supervisors and having to wait for email or microsoft teams is a nightmare.

[2:41:46] dreadvaine: Retail workers went to work daily wearing masks
[2:41:48] cabalish: testing and bringing the game together is way harder if seperatet
[2:41:59] zeiours: 10.0. Ilidian returns
[2:42:01] Z3r0Fear: @MrGattz I can imagine some place there is something written or marked WoW 2? LOL
[2:42:02] Collected1: Gingerprimer : i suspect the issue is time to organise/plan it all. May -> November ain't a lot of time.
[2:42:07] elloonious: I work with 1000 state employees who are 90% working from home. They are horrible at remote working. I think it's the same with about 80% of people
[2:42:23] preheats_lawyer: @Towelliee Honestly the content drought would've been so much more bearable if they hotfixed in soul ash catch up, removed conduit energy and let us swap covenants to play offspecs
[2:42:27] Gingerprimer: @Collected1 yeah prob the only hurdle
[2:42:31] Collected1: i'll hold my hand up. i do a lot less work at home.
[2:42:41] Collected1: my at home productivity sucks
[2:43:00] 91Niki: Yeah not to mention, at home, they might have kids to worry about too, other stuff. Which might distract them more. People don't take that into account
[2:43:32] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee Making a new engine from scrap isn't easy and they probably have been thinking over overhauling the graphics but with all this going on makes that incredibly difficult.
[2:43:35] porowozek: @jooooker too soon, thats 11 or 12. 10.0 is gonna be garrosh or kaelthas returning to azeroth or some shit
[2:43:36] 91Niki: Yep
[2:43:38] fat_european0: Agreed. The penalty just makes it so much less fun. Kinda forced into only playing 1 spec optimally in the raid
[2:43:45] Collected1: the saying i like is working from home = living at work
[2:43:51] NoWaayMan: when you switch covenants do you permanently lose the transmog set?
[2:43:54] KombatWombat07: most of those employees with kids had to do that "school from home shit" to deal with too...
[2:43:55] Malarick: Lord knows that I am no where near as productive at home than in the office.
[2:43:56] gurnt4: sorry honey im moving out covid and all
[2:44:18] Gingerprimer: @NoWaayMan not permently but as long as you are in the new ones yes
[2:44:22] NA_Mus: keep going straight
[2:44:25] kedrius_: have to go to the middle of the map
[2:44:27] SonofHorus82: I think there's a ramp right to your left in there somewhere.
[2:44:28] RogueBear: this really annoying thing that happens when you work from home, is everyone else living there assumes you're available and will bother you with whatever nonsense they have going on
[2:44:32] cyllos: I like working from home, no way I'm going back to the office full time
[2:44:32] MerffTV: find any of the beaches
[2:44:33] Collected1: my biggest issue is working from home allows me to watch twitch all day. i couldn't get away with that in an office.
[2:44:40] MerffTV: they all have paths up
[2:44:45] Streamcrush: water walking :P
[2:44:53] Kindosar: @Collected1 I work from home and have for about 5 years, you really have to be able to separate stuff for it to work well.  People being thrown into it the way it happened isn't easy for people.  But I get what you're saying, it can be an issue if you're not careful.
[2:44:56] MrMorinu: you can be sure devs watch some twitch too :)
[2:44:57] NA_Mus: just reroll shaman 4Head
[2:45:04] NA_Mus: water walking for days
[2:45:08] 91Niki: Then again, the people who "REEEE" about the game and "devs being lazy", are so freaking tunnel visioned about anything going on, you couldn't explain shit on a stick to them.
[2:45:12] Zelium6: clip it
[2:45:12] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee Do you remember when they removed pet feeding on hunters was it Wrath or TBC?
[2:45:15] TheGaoSora: LUL
[2:45:18] TheGaoSora: the timing
[2:45:25] Collected1: Kindosar : oh i hear ya. I worked from home for eight years not so long ago. it needs a LOT of self discipline.
[2:45:26] preheats_lawyer: @Towelliee I worry it wont be enough for this long wait.
[2:45:26] happybooger: yeah, i really enjoy the raid
[2:45:39] Gingerprimer: Like ppl will be happy a new raid/new affix for M+
[2:45:40] Nutsy: Hype PogChamp
[2:45:45] NA_Mus: I have a feeling silv will end up like azhara in some way
[2:45:47] Collected1: Kindosar : my ideal world would be 3 days office, 2 days at home maybe.
[2:45:59] Shrenko: I wish there was no testing for Sylvanas :D
[2:46:04] Skylin3r: this is a map i made back in vanilla
[2:46:14] FresheFefe: tbc let's go (huh)
[2:46:24] 91Niki: Morgan was like pepeMeltdown
[2:46:27] NA_Mus: LUL
[2:46:42] Bixster: i mean she is already a corpse to be fair
[2:46:43] FresheFefe: classic no mo (yah)

[2:47:17] Collected1: Skylin3R : you worked on this?
[2:47:27] rhodeos_: i mean, ofc we would loot her corpse, it wouldnt be PG if we looted her chest
[2:47:42] TheGaoSora: https://clips.twitch.tv/RoundUninterestedPhonePrimeMe-NhVo0eYElV8goxpF
[2:47:43] froglok_: I bet Sylvannas dies but some shit with the spirit realm and what not will keep her soul around as a character for a few expansions lol
[2:47:44] Collected1: this zone would look great with the newer art tools and palettes
[2:48:07] NA_Mus: I mean lore wise the valks (her 9) took her place in the maw. So she might just be sent to the maw since her spirit is still on azeroth and not sent to the maw
[2:48:47] desmo7: Neck level mike tyson
[2:49:01] 91Niki: takes nodes and killing shit
[2:49:02] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee will you ever uppload your old vods I used to watch your legion marathoon
[2:49:04] porowozek: @NA_Mus sylvception pepeMeltdown
[2:49:07] cabalish: this is my property
[2:49:09] fat_european0: I only wish TBC had come out sooner
[2:49:24] fat_european0: the 9.0 content drought and then realistically only getting 1 month of TBC before 9.1? Kinda sucks.
[2:49:31] Artivicii: @fat_european0 yup kinda wish it was out during the lockdown
[2:49:35] Jeddek_: If I dont start playing Classic until Tomorrow (Fully fresh, no lvl 60's already or anything) will I be completely fucked for TBC?
[2:49:41] rhodeos_: man those MoP vods were different times
[2:49:48] Zelium6: what tbc class would be a good fit for me if I play ww monk on retail?
[2:49:50] desmo7: No wayy

[2:49:53] Roughneck124: What if they did make this grind not as bad in 9.0 as previous expansions because of TBC classic was coming out.  So players could play both.

[2:51:59] FresheFefe: mehico
[2:52:42] Exodeo_: Are we expecting broken servers tomorrow as usual? ;p
[2:52:47] Collected1: there is some system where they have to stream x hours to get a certain percentage. i didnt understand it not being a streamer but some people are concerned about that element ofi t.
[2:52:49] Sincline387: could they think it's a lowered cut because it's the same percentage but less money for some subs?
[2:52:51] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee and they did not even tell him about it
[2:52:57] Bulgogiprince: They can see the VPN so can block it
[2:52:59] NA_Mus: so say if I used a vpn thats located in a cheaper country and subbed through it? Would I save money ?
[2:53:02] desmo7: Why is the ah closed
[2:53:03] MrKhanes: The hassle? Im to lazy haha! :D

[2:53:14] RogueBear: changing VPN location doesnt change the currency you're using
[2:53:15] Sincline387: Payment info
[2:53:34] Aidler: @Bulgogiprince believe me... may try that (HBO, Showtime etc.) and nothing really works
[2:53:36] 91Niki: @Towelliee Don't think that works, because you'd need a paypal / credit card that functions for selected country. I tried already to avoid the 25% VAT i get already, for my country
[2:53:40] Collected1: dem gifted mexico subs
[2:53:40] Artivicii: Time to open up a Mexican bank account 4Head viva la mehico
[2:53:40] Bulgogiprince: same as trying to use netflix in another coutry. I can't do that
[2:53:46] Lycis: Twitch will reduce the cuts to other countries so other can sub to lower prices sounds like a scam
[2:53:57] Repsifu: @91Niki 25% ? that's insane
[2:54:05] 91Niki: @Repsifu Yeeep
[2:54:13] DelcoAF: towel what country are most of your viewers from?
[2:54:46] Repsifu: wtf man is the government helping you grow like professionally or what's the "excuse" giving 25% is insane

[2:55:24] MrKhanes: :( hope he will be okey, he seems such a nice dog.
[2:55:26] Gingerprimer: @Repsifu 25% is a common cut in Europe I think I have it here in Sweden
[2:55:27] Artivicii: Weed brownie WutFace
[2:55:28] Kindosar: our 13 yr old has been having seizures, not sure how long she's been having them, rescue
[2:55:30] Lycis: Twitch has to get the lost money somewhere so they just cut the percent
[2:55:30] Alllprimer: my dog use to have lots of seizures ended up brain cancer
[2:55:33] chrslp: My dog gets head tremors and those scared the shit out of me. Cant imagine my dog having a seizure
[2:55:41] Repsifu: yea man but Sweden is nice
[2:55:42] 91Niki: @Repsifu Well VAT is paid off stuff I buy outside of EU. So any purchases above X amount of money, is charged with VAT
[2:55:46] Nuggsz: I had a dog with Epilepsy, its not a nice thing to witness for sure
[2:56:16] Gingerprimer: @91Niki where you from here in sweden the base VAT is 25%
[2:56:17] 91Niki: My first dog Indy got seizures :( It's so scary
[2:56:23] bodli1125: hm still eu paid the most ;D
[2:56:35] 91Niki: @Gingerprimer Denmark, HeyGuys neighbor
[2:56:48] Sincline387: One of my dogs had neurological damage from a reaction to a tick preventative, she had seizures for her whole life, they were not terrible and only happened once a month or so we just took care of her through them and she lived a good life (12 years)
[2:56:48] Gingerprimer: @91Niki HeyGuysHeyGuys
[2:56:50] TheNoobTaurenDruid: vat is 25 in Norway too
[2:57:06] Collected1: time to start doing streams in mexican
[2:57:18] Lycis: yea but if they lower the cut its not helping long term
[2:57:34] Artivicii: It probably helps the streamers in those regions the most
[2:57:37] Gingerprimer: @91Niki  I was in Denmark recently to buy  liquor

[3:09:23] fat_european0: Pirates life for me EZ

[3:11:04] Lesrek: I am really sad that Amazon didn't make the Ryanverse by adding Clark to Jack Ryan.  I want the team together.
[3:11:07] xurelto: @Towelliee is it worth it to boost a char to level 58 in TBC Classic if you're waiting for 9.1?
[3:11:13] SpoonManes: @chrslp who subs to TWELVE services

[3:13:29] fat_european0: longevity
[3:14:14] CrusaderNero: tbh im glad they are keeping legacy classic servers around
[3:14:46] 91Niki: monkaS

[3:16:18] FutileDiploma: @towelliee first wow I played was shadowlands. I am thinking about TBC. Just donâ€™t wanna be that noob leveling in tBc from joining wow so late
[3:16:29] Lesrek: I am so happy we are getting 41 yard nameplates tomorrow

[3:17:23] Userjp: is that the devil's letuce on your vape?
[3:17:27] KillaPr0: one my favorite tom clancy books is Red Storm Rising
[3:17:53] Lesrek: @killapr0 I think it is his best book, which is funny since it isn't in the ryanverse
[3:17:53] Hyelander_: New World has way better gaming mechanics
[3:17:57] preheats_lawyer: I feel like the only reason why there's any hype for Ashes of Creation is because Asmongold watched it on stream
[3:18:35] fat_european0: where can we see the poll?
[3:18:49] Aidler: but of course as asmon put it "the store of AoC and the insane prices are only there to make sure that only true fans sign up"
[3:19:10] fat_european0: cant have your cake and eat it too
[3:19:17] Eviltuna13: ^^
[3:19:20] hnti86: cake is a lie :P \

[3:20:14] Lianor52: what flavor u vape towelliee
[3:20:17] Shrenko: new KiraTV video about AoC released LUL
[3:20:19] Lingermastah15: Somewhere Asmongold is having a meltdown
[3:20:24] CrusaderNero: its the true commodification of gaming
[3:20:38] emjay____: he does shit on that though...
[3:20:42] b0red2de4f: Because one doesn't let you skip all the content
[3:20:43] fat_european0: @Towelliee Oh man that shit just drives me up the wall. Blizz is bad for the TBC 70 dollar deluxe edition, but then they hype up AoC. AoC's cheapest shop item is $75 which only gives you some cosmetic shoulder, game time & in-game currency
[3:20:53] twistedstick1: They have to find ways to make that money and keep investors happy.
[3:20:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:21:16] Lycis: He did a statement on his hypocritical statement bc hes a gamer too
[3:21:18] TazzTheGrimreapper: all this money being spent on AoC, then they goin to drop it and dupe ppl
[3:21:19] SonofHorus82: I wouldnt at all be surprised if there wasnt a payment made to not shit on AoC.
[3:21:20] Jeddek_: People are hypocrites terryb1Smile
[3:21:28] TheGaoSora: LUL
[3:21:30] RayRay_wow: @Jeddek_ indeed
[3:21:32] CrusaderNero: sad thing is, your youtube video about SL needing help is still relevant
[3:21:36] Rosenkranz114: It's good that wow get some competition atleast. Not saying its a wow-killer, but a good competitior
[3:21:45] Aidler: unless... financial investment in AoC Kappa
[3:21:58] nixter93: @Towelliee bro that showcase background looks awesome!!

[3:22:13] Shrenko: I didnt watch it yet but he starts off talking about Steven Sharif
[3:22:17] CrusaderNero: people crave on AoC cause they want something new, something that captures them like wow did.
[3:22:18] TheUnknowing: A store is a store
[3:22:22] callmestray: level boost
[3:22:34] CrusaderNero: when AoC is out, and it flops, people start craving the next one
[3:22:35] twistedstick1: cash shops are not going away. Might as well get use to it.
[3:22:47] preheats_lawyer: I still believe that AoC is just another one of those scam MMOs hyping up the community to grab loads of money
[3:22:52] Eviltuna13: At the end of the day all you need is 2 mounts 1 ground and 1 flying
[3:23:11] KingofMeccano: well the nethergarde keep for eu is definitely feeling busy tonight lol
[3:23:18] jedrad: jedrad_is_rad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[3:23:20] Glenfy: Well, I think is not the same a store with cosmetics, or a store with boosts
[3:23:22] maccaruso: There is a difference.  Pay for cosmetics is way better than pay for power
[3:23:27] Hyelander_: AoC is like the Star Citizen. It has bunch of blind followers that dont like reasoning.
[3:24:00] Lycis: You mean like the Scam role model Scam Citizen, people still defend that nowadays
[3:24:01] ArcaneSyntax: we talking about asmon hyping up a 500$ alpha game?
[3:24:02] Shrenko: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tLOM0inSmA
[3:24:25] fat_european0: @Towelliee I dont care about what's on the shops either tbh. but it's just so odd. you get so much more for the $70 deluxe eiditon in TBC than the $75 MTX in AoC
[3:24:35] Khalostaran: hi
[3:24:36] TheUnknowing: What boggles me is the followers of ashes just going off of word with nothing to show, I think ashes can be good I just don't think all this hype is worth it.
[3:25:03] fat_european0: Idk. It's just the hypocrisy that annoys me a lot
[3:25:07] Hyelander_: Shops are cool unless it goes into pay to win territory, like BDO
[3:25:14] Lycis: He just reacted like all of us would but he forget hes still the CEO of Intrepid
[3:25:16] Supers18: Towelliee would  u buy raid gear from the shop?
[3:25:36] Eviltuna13: I buy the pets and mounts because i like the way they look
[3:26:05] DecayedmiNt: Rift sold raid tier, and it was previous raid gear
[3:26:08] Bayne77: cutting edge LUL
[3:26:09] pizzabull: trueee
[3:26:11] Holysal: archeage
[3:26:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: if you gonna buy raid gear from a shop why even bother playing the game
[3:26:20] fartmancer69: preach it sista
[3:26:21] Hyelander_: Trion kills anything it touches
[3:26:21] sphynx_rayne: rip rift
[3:26:39] pizzabull: what tank u doing for 9.1 champ
[3:26:42] sphynx_rayne: Just bring back Wildstar
[3:26:43] fartmancer69: i had 2 friends that fucking LOVED rift and played the shit out of it and raided but they both quit after that
[3:26:45] nixter93: what are you trying to do right now?
[3:26:54] Lycis: ArcheAge, New World makes now the same mistakes ArcheAge did and the rest will be History
[3:27:09] Eviltuna13: I still haven't gotten Cutting Edge LFR kill crreamShame
[3:27:12] KillchainGames: I dont know what to do with my last day of classic =( cant work on an alt til i get draenei for hunter lol
[3:27:26] NA_Mus: You ever play swg towelie?
[3:27:32] flebbooo: LUL
[3:27:32] Shrenko: @o_illusionz everyone say they missed it but at the end no one played it thats why it died. there was 0 people playing it
[3:27:35] DecayedmiNt: Trion was really greedy
[3:27:42] fat_european0: Same
[3:27:49] DocOtter06: we can't buy the dark portal pass until tomorrow?
[3:27:53] KillchainGames: good point haha i live in australia though....its 5:15am here i just woke up =(
[3:27:54] yankerzzz: what time does it realease im guessing after maitnance?
[3:27:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: i quit swg when they let everyone play as a jedi
[3:28:00] sphynx_rayne: Same wow was my first
[3:28:01] Sacredtenshi: do we for sure get to use our boosts tomorrow on classic
[3:28:06] Noshpan: Only pre-WoW mmo I played was EverQuest & Dark Age of Camelot
[3:28:07] Templexx: played guild wars 1. got 14 day trial for tbc. anndddd now we are here lmao
[3:28:08] mitchcavyy: runescape haha
[3:28:11] Fruity_Pebbles2018: my first mmo was ultima online

[3:28:31] RuFFyLyx: so if I buy dark pass tomorrow I can play my boosted char on prepatch day ?
[3:28:33] Sacredtenshi: fuck idk what server to use my boost on
[3:28:39] Holysal: @RuFFyLyx yes
[3:28:42] TheGaoSora: LUL
[3:28:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: oh you know they are gonna follow asmon all day on their warpstalkers
[3:28:48] Eviltuna13: My first MMO was Everquest pre Kunark and havent looked back. i enjoy all the MMo's i ever played
[3:28:55] Zaanthrax: teh delux does have a boost and 30 days game tiem ?
[3:28:57] TheUnknowing: fund my deluxe and ill stalk staysafe Kappa
[3:28:59] froglok_: Yo I can't wait to have my 4 alts all mounted up following around my main. A warpstalker army!
[3:29:00] maccaruso: Oh we will be.  Warpstalkers everywhere
[3:29:05] DocOtter06: so in theory you can boost a toon and then clone it to the vanilla server?
[3:29:06] flebbooo: the class trainer areas u start at with boosts are gonna be packed LUL
[3:29:09] Supers18: Why r u so against other streamers towelliee
[3:29:16] Vivelli: he be like ya but i refuse to use it outta dignity or somethin
[3:29:17] Lycis: Wildstar tried to copy WoW and made the same mistakes WoW already improved on
[3:29:17] Zaanthrax: seems worth it tbh, for someone whos getting the boost
[3:29:21] belgorm: I logged onto Pagle last night, Org was EMPTY, one little priest appeared after i yelled, all horde left for Mankrik
[3:29:24] yshtola1337: pagle is merging on my server so ill actually get to join your runs if you do open invites
[3:29:24] Eviltuna13: Will the 2 toys be useable in SL?
[3:29:27] TJdps: do the 58 boosts go live tmrw?
[3:29:30] Arocian: towGold
[3:29:38] Zaanthrax: 2 mounts and 2 toys for 15 bucks ? seems good to me
[3:29:48] maccaruso: Only Classic Era Pagle is merging
[3:30:02] DocOtter06: $15 is for the clone
[3:30:05] Lycis: Oh its Money, then its fine of course LUL
[3:30:07] SonofHorus82: I'm just standing in Goldshire handing out Paladin buffs to lowbies.
[3:30:08] Zaanthrax: no cuz im someone whos getting the boost.. thts 40 bucks im getting 15 bucks game time which i will pay anyway
[3:30:14] Zaanthrax: so its 2 mounts 2 toys for 15 bucks

[3:31:29] DecayedmiNt: @Supers18 I wouldn't want raid mog on there, but having comissioned artist stuff up there like some of the mounts, sure.
[3:31:31] ChimmyNeutron: Who cares what other people spend their hard earned money on

[3:33:05] 91Niki: Is the Deluxe edition not up on the store yet ?
[3:33:06] Furydeath9: was wonder why my internet just crapped out they pushed a 1GB patch on beta and PTR
[3:33:11] Shrenko: you have to pay 14.99 a month
[3:33:17] Shrenko: just need a sub
[3:33:25] MrGattz: @Towelliee when is that deluxe edition available to buy?
[3:33:35] TheZlare: @MrGattz Should be tomorrow
[3:33:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: people need to stop getting their news from youtube thumbnails
[3:33:38] DecayedmiNt: Tomorrow
[3:33:42] GussyMarie: im excited for tomorrow!!
[3:33:42] MrGattz: kk ill buy it then
[3:33:49] submotion: @Towelliee what happens if you Ã¹ake a new char? is it a classic char or bc?
[3:33:50] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: but real adventurers get the dark portal pass
[3:33:57] 91Niki: Nah we just looked, can't find it
[3:34:01] MrGattz: nah cant find it
[3:34:05] greentechx: I thought TBC opens June 1st
[3:34:09] maccaruso: Nah you can't buy it until tomorrow
[3:34:13] Artivicii: Momma said TBC is the devil
[3:34:15] fat_european0: they will be different servers, no?
[3:34:20] Domi98_: so is it a diff client or how does it work
[3:34:25] Furydeath9: i think the launcher will have classic and TBC in the drop down
[3:34:26] Domi98_: pretty sure i pre-downloaded the patch
[3:34:27] Sacredtenshi: Can someone tell me if we get to buy the 58 boost tomorrow
[3:34:28] GussyMarie: lolol
[3:34:28] Broomba: should give u a choice
[3:34:31] Broshi89: i figure it will depend on the realm you are on
[3:34:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: current classic client becomes the burning crusade client so new characters will just tbc by default
[3:34:33] flebbooo: @greentechx it does, but the pre patch is tomorrow
[3:34:44] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: moma said tbc knock you out
[3:34:48] callmestray: what professions are you going to be for TBC? mining and something else?
[3:34:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: you would have to select the classic era server to stay there
[3:34:52] guni1980: Why should I main paladin in TBC?
[3:34:52] shmurcules: Chat keeps asking dumb questions .. just wait until tomorrow and see
[3:35:14] froglok_: Because people are fucking crazy these days lol
[3:35:15] Broshi89: since all current classic realms are going to be converted to TBC any character you make on it will probably be a TBCC character
[3:35:20] Furydeath9: it was the $35 clone it just seep over to the delux
[3:35:26] Artivicii: Iâ€™m not because I wanted one LUL
[3:35:27] maccaruso: Bobby Boucher you stay away from that Deluxe Edition.  It's the DEVIL!
[3:35:27] yankerzzz: it says it will be back availble at 3pm PDT? we really think its goin to be down for 8hrs before pre patch?
[3:35:35] Hellizzy: Only thing that surprised me is that they lowered the cost of character clone from 35 to 15
[3:35:51] Nutsy: Is that an addon where he say "rdy to work"?
[3:35:54] letsrock_pt: they will make more money with the these tbc than at the time
[3:35:55] xideontv: imagine scheduling WoW major patchs to the company's earnings release
[3:35:56] MrGattz: guys i heard the server clone is $450 i think its a solid deal imo
[3:36:11] Domini1001: @Towelliee  it is surpirsing becaseu the whole advertising campaign for classic "expirience" was centered about not having stuff from retail and MTX shop was also one of the things
[3:36:15] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: yeah, im guessing afternoon servers up
[3:36:17] Supers18: why did they lower the cost? was it due to the outrage or they were just trying to see what they could get away with?
[3:36:18] GussyMarie: what time does the game go down tomorrow?
[3:36:18] DocOtter06: why are folks so damn against a company making...money? that's what keeps them making content.  am i missing something hear or am i too much of a capitalist?
[3:36:22] 91Niki: @MrGattz Some people just likes to watch the world burn NotLikeThis
[3:36:27] Furydeath9: they have to snap shot MILLIONS of characters
[3:36:35] Sacredtenshi: fuck man, idk if I'm gonna be horde or ally in tbc
[3:36:37] Mythos_Chamber: Yeah, that could be a disaster if it doesn't work right.
[3:36:41] Broomba: @MrGattz heard it was 500 and u get alpha for wraith class and alpha, beta to 10
[3:36:42] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee  I expect they come up early, then get a bunch of hot fixes and resets.
[3:36:44] yankerzzz: cool and im sure within the 2-3hrs of actual release im sure the bundles will become availble on the store i hope.
[3:36:45] byrdeen45: about the time i get home from work
[3:36:52] MrGattz: @Broomba id do it

[3:37:30] Furydeath9: i like how the FAQ is all well if you pick wrong you can always just buy the clone service :)
[3:37:35] flebbooo: i can easily see there being like 5-8 hour waiting to get your boost LUL
[3:37:43] rambo1156: europe have to wait one more day sadge
[3:37:45] Supers18: or maybe its just me since i haven't been around a lot of wow streams lately
