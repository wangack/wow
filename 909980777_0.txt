[1:19:52] Sincline387: I'd rather they do it right then fuck it up even more
[1:20:05] xluckydawgx: But doesnt the valor update need like some serious hotfixxing??? With the complaints im seeing, it would fail miserably at the moment
[1:20:05] Masqerader: Just imagine if they let loot drop like in bfa,
[1:20:26] PadidinJones: lets hope blizz is listening
[1:20:41] GodKingMuninn: @FURL_ Considering base UI is crap and has all your information scattered about and makes you take longer to process whats going on? Yes elvui is a LOT better than default. However theres a lot of options
[1:20:42] bennythejet_ne: Just In time for all of us to have higher than 220 ilvl
[1:21:02] Phae__: I find it odd that they capped KSM level gear at 220, though. If 2400+ PvP is 226, then why can't the highest keys yield the same gear?

[1:21:19] TheOGDaywalker: @Phae__ true
[1:21:22] FURL_: @Towelliee getting all +15s for casuals is quite challenging. its doable but challenging.
[1:21:29] RunningOutOfRAM: Yeha but PVP is the besat gearing LUL
[1:21:47] MrGattz: they only did half of the job with the valor update. and it was the wrong half. loot still needs to drop more and we still need a physical vender to spend points on new gear.
[1:21:49] Masqerader: Just imagine if they didn't fuck with loot to start with
[1:22:01] Morpheusx25: @MrGattz true
[1:22:08] Masqerader: It's always a we told you so moment with Blizzard and they don't listen
[1:22:11] bukka_hot: at start of tier its also way harder

[1:22:29] Kromede: lala land
[1:22:30] TheOGDaywalker: yeah im at 207, I can do about +10 keys
[1:22:31] Mecabeast: im just now sometimes timing 10s
[1:22:38] FURL_: well they can work their way up after they get a few 220 +10 pieces from their vault
[1:22:38] L33TInTheBoat: it me. stuck at 202 because I'm a loser casual

[1:23:21] Malarick: had a healer drop out of a 6 Spires on the last boss because he didnt know what he was doing and no one was toxic beleive it or not

[1:23:27] Wildside1177: I think you are exactly right.
[1:23:31] Broomba: im bobby joe towJoe
[1:23:32] Phae__: It can help a bit, though. My KSM group ranges from 214-219, so there is room for us to get upgrades, but yeah, it's gonna be awesome for alts.
[1:23:35] Warro726: I think Bliz is missing the point of the system. Its not the issue of lack of Ilvl gear but lack of targeted gear. Every slot but my weps are 210+, weps are 197...
[1:23:40] TheOGDaywalker: just get the alts to 60 and wait
[1:23:47] Clay2K_: @Towelliee you're on a dps
[1:24:06] armeleth: alts to 60 and get soul ash I guess
[1:24:09] PadidinJones: its a middle finger to casuals...
[1:24:10] bigrogue_35: totally agree man. 202 ilvl and i cant get into a +8 or +9 to save my life
[1:24:19] bennythejet_ne: got DOS 15 with one second left for my KSM last night--butt clencher
[1:24:24] Sandisy: you'll have to get the base item to upgrade first. 46 m+ in dungeons that drop weapon, not had one since I did +3 week one.
[1:24:31] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee Yeah just get it.
[1:24:43] Masqerader: the addon that taunts and haunts your nightmares
[1:24:46] Broomba: rubbing that salt in the wound
[1:24:48] TheOGDaywalker: so PVP is how you get the highest lvl gear at this point right? or is it raids
[1:24:53] Warro726: @Sandisy same, like I said its not Ilvl issue but targeted loot issue

[1:24:56] MOLAR305: is this an alliance toon?
[1:25:01] Decoyszn: @PadidinJones I mean, but who really cares about casuals?
[1:25:01] brayan1104: !valor
[1:25:01] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[1:25:25] Decoyszn: @Daywalker0922 its both.
[1:25:43] xluckydawgx: That new Conq banner for Warrior tho
[1:25:50] Chris_127: i think a rotating vendor like corruption selling m+ gear would be sick
[1:25:50] Decoyszn: I really don’t think they are worrying about casuals with this patch...
[1:25:59] Morpheusx25: SL goes from best xpac to meh lol
[1:26:05] Warro726: They should just copy the conquest system to valor with upgrading options with valor
[1:26:12] Koravd: So is this xpac really falling off for people?
[1:26:16] Masqerader: @ItsDecoySZN if they like sub retention they will
[1:26:40] Decoyszn: @Masqerader Casuals arent the issue right now. Its the people who run pve content and barely have any good loot
[1:26:57] Masqerader: @ItsDecoySZN who do u think runs that content... LOL
[1:27:04] PadidinJones: @Towelliee they also did not include the fucking flight whistle.
[1:27:06] Decoyszn: @Masqerader People running M+ arent casuals....
[1:27:16] Masqerader: @ItsDecoySZN that is the dumbest thing ever
[1:27:30] WestonTeli: because casuals can't get into them @ItsDecoySZN
[1:27:34] Plague_GG: Maybe 9.1 @padidinjones
[1:27:38] bennythejet_ne: I have run 50 ish 10/15s and I still have a 210 weap from a month ago
[1:27:51] Decoyszn: Then we have different definitions of "casual". My Dad is a casual and is completely happy doing his WQ and Torghast. He's never touched a Mythic and doesnt want to.
[1:28:01] mageador: Are you playing the game in 4K?
[1:28:23] Aktz_: Pog
[1:28:23] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:28:35] branninjackson: HI, long time viewer here. How could you betray the alliance? lol
[1:28:45] DIN0S0URS: I thought torghast was going to be really fun. Can't stand going in there
[1:28:46] PadidinJones: @plague_seraph Really? Still too long though. I feel that if its going to take till 9.1 how long will it take till we get flying?
[1:28:51] Koravd: Damn so if they fixed raid loot youll come back?
[1:28:55] Aktz_: KEKW
[1:28:58] Kromede: "long time"
[1:29:00] thebakeriscomingforu: Some weeks I have time for mythics, some weeks I don't
[1:29:03] mizerboy: Yeah I stopped playing this xpac 5 weeks ago. In my opinion this xpac is for the 1% not for everyone
[1:29:14] mrfaildruid: mrfail1Chewy mrfail1Chewy
[1:29:15] branninjackson: "long time"
[1:29:19] Decoyszn: @mizerboy In what way? Lol
[1:29:26] branninjackson: !follow
[1:29:26] Zettabyte: evening @Towelliee towHi
[1:29:34] Plague_GG: we didn’t get flying in bfa until 9.2 I think. @padidinjones
[1:29:48] Masqerader: @ItsDecoySZN a general casual player in mythic + will run a 2-6? there is a reason they have an upgrade for all +5s no one running 10s to 15 is really gonna care up for the upgrade system except for a few pieces they haven't gotten at this point (trinkets/weapons)
[1:29:54] FURL_: I still have so much to do in game. I feel like this xpack has kept my attention more than BFA. I also don't feel like I have to constantly play to keep up like artifact power/azerite
[1:29:59] Noot: Noot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[1:30:08] Phae__: I actually find SL way more alt friendly than BFA, but mainly because I PvP a lot also, which is ironically the easiest way to gear. BFA, especially in the last two major raids, felt so time-consuming for alts
[1:30:20] Koravd: I see... i've been off the loop lately i thought i was hearing not long ago everybody happy with the xpac now every stream is people unhappy that sucks lol
[1:30:32] Kromede: towUnforch
[1:30:44] Decoyszn: @Masqerader I mean I agree with you, I just don't consider anyone doing a M+ a casual. At that point, you genuinely care about progressing and gearing. In my own opinion - casuals don't care about that
[1:30:51] egraves7: more alt friendly than bfa isn't a super high bar though
[1:30:54] Kromede: pvp FailFish
[1:30:58] paulson14: lol exactly
[1:31:02] thebakeriscomingforu: Its alt friendly until item level 200
[1:31:09] Phae__: @egraves7 You're not wrong
[1:31:21] thebakeriscomingforu: truth
[1:31:30] Masqerader: BFA was alt friendly 2 years in
[1:31:33] Phae__: But ya gotta take what ya can get sometimes LUL
[1:31:46] mrfaildruid: same
[1:31:51] RunningOutOfRAM: D:
[1:31:53] RunningOutOfRAM: Wot
[1:32:02] RunningOutOfRAM: WOoot?
[1:32:09] NickLeonhearth: star wars....uf
[1:32:13] Finarato: I feel burnt out on mythic + after all these expansions
[1:32:16] Phae__: SWTOR, RIP
[1:32:18] Finarato: too much stress
[1:32:19] Koravd: People complaining in XIV too that theres not enough hardcore content
[1:32:27] Masqerader: Or NBA 2k and the coach who pulls u out of the game after ur team is winning and they lose lol
[1:32:36] Phae__: Loved SWTOR for the first couple years.
[1:32:42] GhostFace_23: same for me m+ and open world content is miserable in SL
[1:32:50] mrfaildruid: I think i have a 30 something when i stoped too lol
[1:32:50] jiffynuts: SWTOR has great storylines
[1:33:01] Broomba: whats the cap level for SWTOR?
[1:33:01] ObsidianHealer: SWTOR raiding was good the first like 4ish years after that the end game died for me.
[1:33:11] WestonTeli: wow is the same story every expac now, idk why people expect something different. straight stockholm syndrome lmao
[1:33:27] Decoyszn: Damn, I'm genuinely happy with the game right now. I agree loot needs to be figured out for PVE, but other than that - a lot of the content is fun
[1:33:35] mrfaildruid: lol
[1:33:36] RunningOutOfRAM: SCHAAAAAAAMPION
[1:33:38] PadidinJones: the woooooooooooons
[1:33:48] Templexx: the love hate hahah
[1:33:50] Phae__: Azeroth CRIES OUT
[1:33:56] Masqerader: im just counting down till re8 village
[1:34:02] Masqerader: just under 3 months
[1:34:19] psycho_scythe: Diamond dwarf RIP
[1:34:22] paulson14: 35 anima
[1:34:24] Morpheusx25: legion had something right
[1:34:26] sellemg: what mic youre using?
[1:34:28] RunningOutOfRAM: lul
[1:34:40] Decoyszn: Yah we must be opposite. I like the freedom of playing whatever content or character I want - instead of being forced to constantly grind a SPECIFIC character for extra power
[1:34:43] gregl__: good
[1:34:47] gregl__: less time needed to raid
[1:34:49] Phae__: You don't like farming anima so you can get a portal to Oribos?
[1:34:50] Finarato: just that anima farm
[1:34:54] Thoreya: That’s what people wanted
[1:34:57] Scotty2Time: Your the only one with time to do all that lol
[1:34:58] Thoreya: So that’s what happens
[1:35:01] psycho_scythe: towHesaidit
[1:35:16] mavericks312: i like the feeling of not having to log on everyday with SL
[1:35:19] wreckshoptv: true man
[1:35:27] Masqerader: If I want wings mog I will play diablo 3
[1:35:30] RunningOutOfRAM: LUL
[1:35:31] Phae__: LUL
[1:35:44] Rubbadubdub418: idk man im sure you did island grinds to but that shit burnt me out hard
[1:35:47] Phae__: But the loooore
[1:35:49] Snappole_: and this is why i love playing a mage lol
[1:35:51] paulson14: 20k
[1:35:51] gregl__: you needed to treat wow as a full time job to raid the past 2 xpacs
[1:35:54] gregl__: now you don't
[1:35:57] paulson14: which would take 2 years to farm
[1:35:57] fubardman: literally just found that out today lol. waste of 10k
[1:35:59] gregl__: its better how it is now
[1:36:00] sellemg: @Towelliee what mic are you using?
[1:36:11] Mecabeast: itll be bout tree fiddy
[1:36:22] PadidinJones: Im still waiting for Thrall and Draka to reunite
[1:36:23] TiredCarcass: this is the one
[1:36:26] koraller_bjn: agreed
[1:36:28] Snappole_: Do you have any next raid predictions?
[1:36:30] Phae__: No cap, same here. Lore is one of my favorite parts of wow. Have you read the Chronicles, @Towelliee ?
[1:36:36] Lazugo: https://twitter.com/LimitThdlock/status/1306948989565259776 thd was right all along @Towelliee
[1:36:36] Kromede: devolore will be happy to hear this
[1:36:41] TiredCarcass: rocket coming up
[1:36:50] Griffo525: I'm literally leveling alts, that's it at the moment nothing else keeps me interested
[1:36:56] Koravd: Legion for me was the best expansion of the modern wow era
[1:37:02] Broomba: you can level up your level 50 alts to 60
[1:37:11] GhostFace_23: the way they wasted Azshara and Nzoth last time I have no interest in more sylvanas and anduin this xpac
[1:37:17] PadidinJones: Frost DK huh
[1:37:24] psycho_scythe: Wrath, Legion, BC are my top 3 without a doubt
[1:37:30] Brodih_: cant wait for classic TBC to come back to WoW
[1:37:35] RunningOutOfRAM: @GhostFace_23 they are sting them up for future exps
[1:38:04] GhostFace_23: @runningoutofram, I hope so, both deserve bigger story lines imo
[1:38:05] Shredmuffn: shadowlands is the exact opposite now lol PvP'ers get all the gear and systems for upgrading lol and PvE is left feeling like legion and bfa was for pvp'ers
[1:38:16] wreckshoptv: i think maldraxxus will be next raid whit kel thuzad :P
[1:38:18] shimwood: We still need to find out what's going on with Garrosh FeelsBadMan
[1:38:20] dannyis1337: dannyis1337 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months!

[1:39:29] psycho_scythe: Same, plague. Same.
[1:39:36] Broomba: @towellliee bc classic in 2022?
[1:39:46] Finarato: may 4th 2021 broomba
[1:39:59] BreakingSeth: i hope they dont release tbc classic just to cuck ppl who want it xD
[1:40:03] Broomba: @Finarato thats been confirmed as the release date?
[1:40:08] Finarato: who knows
[1:40:09] Masqerader: get both glaives then quit the game,
[1:40:52] Brodih_: im keeping my dwarf priest, dwarfs #1!

[1:40:57] Noshpan: @Towelliee Didn't you once streamed your guild doing Gruul's Lair waaay back in the day before Justin tv?
[1:41:11] wetttnine: Get a mage friend to boost you to 58 @towelliee
[1:41:47] Kromede: true
[1:42:11] gregl__: no
[1:42:12] Decoyszn: noooo way lol
[1:42:16] gregl__: 233 weapons from 15's is a joke
[1:42:16] Decoyszn: they cant make raids obselete...
[1:42:22] ThisTHC: how? you get 220 out of vault from 10
[1:42:25] gregl__: 15's are a joke compared to mythic last boss of the tier
[1:42:28] Noshpan: I'm thinking of making a Blood Elf Warlock for TBC servers. Back when I first played, my 3rd character was a Blood Elf Paladin. 4th was Blood Elf Hunter.
[1:42:29] gregl__: and 2400 in arena
[1:42:38] Decoyszn: pve raids would literally be obselete, why on earth would they do that
[1:42:56] Hazzarri: 220 for all 10s doesn't make sense imo
[1:42:57] Decoyszn: pvp and M+ isnt supposed to be balanced lol
[1:43:27] gregl__: its way easier for pvpers to get all 15's than it is for pvers to get 2400
[1:43:30] gregl__: its not even close
[1:43:41] Decoyszn: ^^
[1:43:49] Plague_GG: Glad is like 20+
[1:43:51] Clicklesly: I mean, most people already kinda outgear Conqueror, you'll never outgear Gladiator ^^
[1:43:54] Lazugo: so you have to make that pvp and m+ dont mix and vice versa but the solution is pvp stats and people hate that
[1:44:10] wreckshoptv: F
[1:44:10] Phae__: RIP oondosta spawn
[1:44:19] Kromede: towUnforch
[1:44:20] Phae__: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[1:44:21] nocturnal_2195: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[1:44:28] Phae__: Love Rocket redemption drop
[1:44:33] GodKingMuninn: I think anything below 213 ilvl equivalent doesn't matter, thats a cusp point anyways
[1:44:35] Decoyszn: @lazugo or if youre a pver, then do raids... lol
[1:45:04] Phae__: @ItsDecoySZN But not everyone has time for raids. I can do a +15 in 30ish minutes. Can't work on progression in that same timeframe
[1:45:09] Masqerader: but pvp doesn't have tyrannical lol
[1:45:14] ThisTHC: already is KEKW
[1:45:28] GodKingMuninn: Make all forms of content more viable for more people and the longevity of the game will improve

[1:45:41] gregl__: if blizzard buffs raid and dungoens we will all be max ilevel in 2 weeks
[1:45:43] Decoyszn: @Phae__ then honestly you don’t deserve top pve gear imo
[1:45:50] sourfarts: Make battlegrounds have volcanic
[1:45:52] alaskagodx: yep i've killed mythic shriek/hunts 6 times now and still have 2 things i need on them
[1:46:24] Phae__: @ItsDecoySZN Why? Pushing keys is more fun to me, and it's arguably as challenging in the top tier. Why don't I deserve top pve gear if I can push 18s and higher?
[1:46:25] Decoyszn: @Phae__ if you could get top gear from M+ only, why would anyone ever spend time on raids?
[1:46:37] alaskagodx: makes me feel like i shouldn't even be raiding with how it is now
[1:46:38] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[1:46:42] Decoyszn: @Phae__ it makes all their work and time on designing raids obselete
[1:46:43] Phae__: @ItsDecoySZN BiS items? Cause they want to?
[1:46:50] TheOGDaywalker: I kinda like the idea of building (valor) like honor thru mythic dungeons then using that to buy gear
[1:47:00] Baernern: depends on how fast valor is to get
[1:47:17] mizerboy: @ItsDecoySZN - because that person enjoys raiding?
[1:47:19] Phae__: @ItsDecoySZN No, no it doesn't. That's ad absurdum claim.
[1:47:20] Crystalyzee: knowing blizz you will prob only be able to upgrade a piece every week or every other week
[1:47:45] Lazugo: @ItsDecoySZN you delusional bro
[1:47:47] GodKingMuninn: I like being able to get to a heroic ilvl in a week (if I bust my ass) or 2-3 if casual. Then spend rest of the time trying to upgrade to mythic/bis.
[1:47:47] bignuge11: @Towelliee my girlfriend is new to wow and playing healer im going to tank for her and also dps so im not stuck tanking all the time with thtat said what do you think paladin or DH?
[1:47:51] Phae__: Some people want to raid. Some people prefer M+, and some people prefer PvP. M+ is a significant part of the game now, so it should be rewarded as such
[1:47:55] Decoyszn: @lazugo nah yall are lol
[1:48:09] Phae__: If you're in the top percent of the M+ groups, your gear should be comparable. Simple enough
[1:48:22] GodKingMuninn: @blitzxkreig didn't you ask panda this too?
[1:48:47] bignuge11: yeah getting my favorite streamers opinions @Confused_Raven ?
[1:48:55] Crystalyzee: just press w as veng dh
[1:48:57] alaskagodx: gotta debate between like spirit bomb or more tanky options right?
[1:49:06] KingSlayerYotam: ive switched from prot pala to DH and its way more fun
[1:50:04] dracullus: Jesus, I got Rose, mask and pet is same box
[1:50:38] Phae__: Gotta head out for a bit. GL with the mount @Towelliee !
[1:51:26] byrdeen45: damn love rockets a lie

[1:51:46] MOLAR305: i dont use it in Dungeons, only world content
[1:52:16] GodKingMuninn: @blitzxkreig Okay, just trying to make sure i'm not going crazy and having some weird deja vu here xD
[1:52:35] MOLAR305: fiery brand you want to use cleave
[1:52:37] Kromede: i have the fiery brand build, its aswesome
[1:52:56] KingSlayerYotam: you pick Flesh not bomb
[1:52:56] MOLAR305: so you dont spend shards on spirit bomb
[1:53:08] Masqerader: no need for spirit bomb cause u want those soul fragments to reduce the fiery brand cooldown
[1:53:18] MOLAR305: but you can use it in sigils build bc of dmg reduction from spirit

[1:56:17] MOLAR305: max was saying if your entire raid is necro, you could pull a healer
[1:57:12] ObsidianHealer: @MOLAR305 thats kinda crazy to think about
[1:57:27] MOLAR305: you make up the dmg with another dps class

[2:48:04] PleaseeStop: i played tbc when i was 14, then again at 20 on a private server as a druid tank, was the most fun i ever had in wow
[2:48:08] short_bus4: I was always offtank during bc on my pally, everybody still remembered vanilla too well
[2:48:08] dragothicx: definitely true though, TBC is so much Nostalgia goodness
[2:48:22] WilliamMousseau: what server you on
[2:48:26] YardRage: I just leveled an alt in TBC.. it was not as good as I remembered
[2:48:26] WSquiggle12: Have you done and TBC prep or you just gonna wait for the marathon?
[2:48:38] Masqerader: my not so favorite moment of tbc was having an 8 hour flight, and being up for 20 hours and falling asleep at the keyboard and auto running into bear boss in ZA and killing a mount run LOL
[2:48:41] moonlleek: tbc is were i started and it is the one what i ve played on privates for years because its just so good!
[2:48:49] GodKingMuninn: Are you using plater or tidy plates atm?

[2:49:08] short_bus4: whats uncrushable again?
[2:49:14] short_bus4: 102.3% or something?
[2:49:20] Kyrrua: @YardRage well leveling is better in classic. in tbc you are concentrated into the same zones, everyone knows its one of tbc weaknesses

[2:56:50] Vorog1: ZA was awesome
[2:56:52] pavepawns: mount hyjal sucked
[2:56:56] trivwik: I got a sexy 16 mysts waiting for ya
[2:57:11] Phae__: Hyjal is boring af, imo
[2:57:36] Vorog1: I used to watch Arikah ret pally in Sunwell
[2:57:50] Phae__: The lore is awesome, just hated the trash clearing stuff
[2:57:56] pavepawns: if we talk tbc i only liked 2 raids karazahan and BT

[3:00:20] shimwood: I hated Netherstorm
[3:00:26] Fruity_Pebbles2018: @Towelliee what addon is that that tells you what spell to use next?
[3:00:39] Dyriks: I just farmed motes using the engineer vacuum device
[3:00:43] pavepawns: netherstorm was the worst place IMO i liked blades edge and shadowmoon valley the most
[3:00:51] Twigz_KC: oh man, I had a whole mining routine down that I would spend hours on each day

[3:01:04] CodyKane: warlock summons
[3:01:08] XxExiLexX: lock port
[3:01:10] jakobsurfs: wasnt a portal back then
[3:01:21] jxecho9094: Had to fly and summon people up that didnt have it
[3:01:24] Vorog1: I thought there was a port that would take you up
[3:01:27] Moondrius: i thought the entrance was on the ground?
[3:01:29] Vorog1: Maybe not
[3:01:33] dragothicx: you definitely did fly there? lvl 70 flying was on trainers
[3:01:39] jawnbone: @fruity_pebbles2018 I think it’s Hekili
[3:02:15] xvstormvx: @Towelliee ugh the horsemen suck
[3:02:17] Vorog1: Thats right you have to fly to TK I was wrong
[3:02:26] NOHITJEROME: im not a huge attunement fan
[3:02:29] NOHITJEROME: that chart is insane LUL
[3:02:31] pavepawns: TBC The story of attunements
[3:02:32] jakobsurfs: get your MS paint maps ready baby
[3:02:36] Vorog1: Kara attune was long lol
[3:02:44] Twigz_KC: and remember in TBC, you can't do heroic until you grind the rep for the zones' faction
[3:02:44] temp3st98: Mop classic when? LUL
[3:02:51] Alaquane: I swear they removed all the attunements near the end
[3:03:31] Guillin: Isn't Shattered Halls from the Fel Reaver if I remember?

[3:03:53] Phae__: Elemental plateau farming for motes, anyone? good times LUL
[3:04:08] xvstormvx: @Towelliee za, zg attunement gonna be fun

[3:04:25] CrowCommando: Unga Bunga
[3:04:30] Guillin: Can you imagine the Dark Portal on a PvP server xD
[3:04:47] jxecho9094: Flying will help a bit with pvp servers but it will still be bad
[3:04:53] gorilla_quantistico: goin horde or alli for tbc?
[3:05:23] Plague_GG: Dark portal event? towPog
[3:05:26] Thoreya: I still don’t know what class to play for BC. I played arms back then idk if I wanna do that again
[3:05:40] Twigz_KC: I have a 60 resto druid in Classic, but I want to go back to Warlock in TBC
[3:06:09] BigD530: wasnt it during BC that they intro'd Titan's Grip for Fury warriors?
[3:06:21] Thoreya: True. I plan on doing pvp mostly so I’m thinking mage or lock
[3:06:55] jxecho9094: They should honestly just start every new character at level 60, if people wanted to level to 1-60 then thats what classic is for
[3:07:06] Plague_GG: Weren’t locks one of the hardest classes to play back then?
[3:07:13] shimwood: I think I'll go back to Boomkin for TBC, didn't have a lot of fun on my Mage in Classic
[3:08:23] BigD530: @plague_seraph I think so, lots of Affliction specs back then
[3:08:33] josh8555: and made stunlock rogues lol
[3:08:38] josh8555: mace*

[5:27:55] Traxacon: @Towelliee do you think there will be a catchup for the 226 conduits you dont get like would it be smart to get the ones you need and then stop if you get lucky
[5:28:43] thrasnerv: @Towelliee Is feral druid as bad as people say still this expansion? New player here.
[5:28:49] shimwood: It should be a token that we get to choose to apply to a Conduit
