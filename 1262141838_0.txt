[0:40:43] pacificmc1: there's a new 10.0 leak KEKW
[0:40:52] Dreadfrost: a very good morning to you sir @Towelliee
[0:40:58] pacificmc1: noo there's another one
[0:41:07] obbi87: where
[0:41:09] pacificmc1: it seems plausible tbh
[0:41:11] pacificmc1: can i link
[0:41:18] pacificmc1: https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2613054-10-0-Leak
[0:41:18] obbi87: on what site?
[0:41:25] MrGattz: at this point im gonna go write a 10.0 leak. seems like its the hot new craze these days for kids
[0:41:31] pacificmc1: the poster got banned like 10min after the post KEKW
[0:41:36] luckfore: it sounds cool
[0:41:52] Screamnsteam: do it Gattz EZ
[0:41:58] MrGattz: @Screamnsteam i just might
[0:42:43] pacificmc1: KEKW
[0:42:46] obbi87: Dragon Form is mainly used for travel and two racial abilities, story will explain why Black Dragons need to learn how to fight like mortals as one of the classes. <-- this sounds stupid

[0:43:11] pacificmc1: DO IT
[0:43:12] pacificmc1: KEKW
[0:43:13] MrGattz: actually thats a good idea
[0:43:22] MrGattz: but do it under your name and post it to reddit
[0:43:37] obbi87: Why even have a dragon race, if the "dragon form" only works in flight
[0:43:59] MrGattz: might as well, its not like mmoc has anything worth while on it 99% of the time
[0:45:00] obbi87: @Towelliee True, but the leak says, we will still fight in our human form, but Dragon form is only for flight. why create a new race, so we get a flight form :P
[0:46:10] obbi87: This leak sounds so bad.  treasure finding. yeah like we want the crappy treasure  blizzard have made :P
[0:46:36] MrGattz: i really do hope the new class is tinker though for 10.0 from that other leak. also they need to make survival hunters a tank spec. thats all i want lol
[0:46:45] boxxxxxxxxxxx: I'm sure it's still better than the crappy treasure from new world LUL

[0:54:20] falldrgn: Intermittent fasting is good. but at a certain point.. you need the calories..
[0:54:54] Cicvara1: there are variations,  some are 23/1,  others are 4/20 or 8/16.   I've done the 23/1, works really well but is a bit extreme

[1:08:01] theszoti: the "world shaping" sounds similar to the cypher from 9.2

[1:08:56] Sollice: of course its dumb, all of those things are abilities in game already. Let's announce a new expansion with shit everyone already has. This person who created these leaks may be low key 10 IQ
[1:09:06] pavepawns: well just read it. its pretty awful imo atleast storywise
[1:09:09] pacificmc1: KEKW
[1:09:11] pavepawns: the leak that is
[1:09:21] Alegnowar: what leak?
[1:09:32] Sollice: There is no leak

[1:09:41] falldrgn: I feel like its a good idea.. Dude is just causing needless draama

[1:11:05] Ragnarage95: Are the factor meals filling towelliee?
[1:11:09] RealMelorandor: Most leaks are fake up until the weeks/days leading up to the expansion reveal from what I found out.
[1:11:34] pavepawns: well dragon isles and light vs void themed expansions are the most safe choices
[1:11:48] pavepawns: when it comes to making fake leaks

[1:12:45] Galifaxs: I recently watched a video saying there really isn’t a lore reason right now to go to the dragon isles
[1:12:49] pavepawns: you could stay on azeroth. if they did timeskip with alleria and turalyon going all crazed bringing in huge armies of both void and light
[1:12:51] RealMelorandor: We already know that the next expansion is going to be on Azeroth, so yeah its either Dragon Isles or different/revamped Azeroth.
[1:12:55] CaptnPotatoTV: multiverse azeroth

[1:12:56] obbi87: PLZ!!! no new planet, i wanna go back to our world. so tired of the "EXP island"
[1:13:22] raldrik: I hope that shadowlands being a flop means the put more effort into making a huge splash in 10.0 and not just another expansion.
[1:13:39] enviouscat: I just hope we get some connected zones where I dont have to use a flight path to go to another zone or a portal..
[1:13:45] pavepawns: i just rly wanna beat up alleria is what im saying
[1:14:10] xBanosh: !leaks
[1:14:21] RealMelorandor: @raldrik yeah 10.0 is going to have a lot more effort put into it like Legion did.
[1:14:42] enviouscat: @pavepawns why ?
[1:14:45] Alegnowar: honestly tho true or fake that guy put a lot of effort on that post
[1:15:00] Alegnowar: and it sounds pretty damn good
[1:15:13] pavepawns: cause i like it when we beat up ppl related to factions
[1:15:22] Broomba: That guy posting that 10.0 post took 5 min
[1:15:36] CaptainAlkohol: yeah from all the leaks until now this is the top believable one
[1:15:38] Screamnsteam: progress bar is bugged sometimes
[1:16:06] king_julian_96: toweliee what's your reaction to all this peopel gettign pissed off about have to grind rep so they can equip 2 leggos in 9.2
[1:16:30] brokenjester: nah
[1:17:02] RealMelorandor: Since 2007 when I was like 11 years old
[1:17:21] Broomba: Scripe is now pissed off about the rep grind
[1:17:23] CaptainAlkohol: @dosetsu2 its not the mdi and wf people complaining lol. go read the forums
[1:17:23] raldrik: if you want everything handed to you without a grind go play a FPS
[1:17:25] RealMelorandor: kids these days
[1:17:29] Brandiops: how is the rep gained? because like before you used to be able to grind rep other ways ie dungeons or mobs
[1:17:30] obbi87: I dont mind the rep farm, im just tried of the way we have to do it. 3 dailys , its boring. Bring back mob farm. 5rep pr mob, would even do 2Rep pr mob
[1:17:32] pavepawns: wait u were a warthog? i thought u were a tauren

[1:18:33] RealMelorandor: I rather rep grind. I like rep grinding
[1:18:45] RealMelorandor: Put on some jams, grind that rep just like old days
[1:19:03] flebbooo: yep
[1:19:11] Tauren0309: Agree 100%
[1:19:12] Brandiops: Why cant they just add mobs or other ways to farm the rep too then atleast its not just gated
[1:19:14] HahnAndOnly: i just joined  the stream, what is the 10.0 leaks ?
[1:19:27] raldrik: I think the issue with modern rep is that you dont get it from farming mobs. It is time locked behind dailies
[1:19:35] Strouss: same that is a catchy title.
[1:19:36] Hayon5: KEKW
[1:19:39] Sarocus: luxthoLurk Did someone say 10.0 leaks?
[1:19:44] Alepouditsa: yep, yep i don't raid

[1:20:03] pronkk_: https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2613054-10-0-Leak
[1:20:03] RealMelorandor: Lol...Man, I can remember being a youngin during WoTLK putting on some Journey and grinding Oracle rep and Argent Commendations. Was good.
[1:20:05] Alepouditsa: ohh for the legendery? i don't care if i don't have it
[1:20:31] Zippaya: WTS all over the place
[1:20:55] GeorgeNoX: TBH if you cant do a normal raid even then you should probably not even have two leggo's
[1:20:59] Hayon5: normal KEKW
[1:21:31] Y_U_CRYIN: When everyone is special than no one is LIL
[1:21:32] RealMelorandor: Legendaries quit being prestigous when every DH has Warglaives of Azzinoth now LOL
[1:21:42] mmo_kenna_: normal might be easy but for ppl who have like 1hr to play you can't even get a group going
[1:21:42] mavericks312: even if blizz gave us the double leggo for free ppl would have complained
[1:21:46] Brandiops: reputation isnt what it used to be either
[1:21:49] OakenHilt: hmm disappointing take
[1:21:50] pronkk_: @realMelorandor quite literally the only reason is BT timewalking
[1:21:56] flebbooo: if they ever wanna do "real" legendaries again they would have to make it its own new category like artifcats or something
[1:21:57] Screamnsteam: legos are orange instead of purple nothing more KEKW
[1:22:15] RealMelorandor: I mean does no one remember Artifact Weapons from Legion and everyone was an Assbringer
[1:22:31] pronkk_: i prefer legiondaries to slands
[1:22:40] ryanc1124: once you could buy them in the end it was over over
[1:22:44] king_julian_96: i guess most people these day if they see anythign that takes longer then a couple weeks peopel bitch cause they are lazy now days and just expect to be able to get they shit they want pretty much straight away and when they can't  and it takes up to weeks of grinding rep peopel bitch but i don't care i know i am goign to get both my leggos eventually grinding rep so iam not mad but these lazy babies are i don't get it

[1:23:29] ryanc1124: yeah i had every lego on my mistweaver except my BIS up until you could buy them bc it never dropped lol
[1:23:36] bonkyouded: I think they should just make the only way of getting a legendary is via the raiding with a guild. it should be a achivement like killing the last boss
[1:23:57] CaptainAlkohol: @bonkyouded people would flip their shit lol
[1:23:58] ravenwingz0405: I remember in Legion not getting my BiS shadow priest leggo until it was the very last one i could get

[1:30:00] Galadeon: 9.2 on the day Lost Ark comes out.
[1:30:01] Aquadriel: until after*
[1:30:23] Okri24: only US servers right?

[1:32:26] Aquadriel: yeah its like diablo, dont need a tank, just know how and when to activate any defensives you have
[1:32:39] Aquadriel: maybe start korthia
[1:32:40] Galadeon: Lost Ark, no tanking, but there are 2 classes that can heal
[1:32:51] Phaedrin: I think you had to have done the korthia intro

[1:38:35] Narmus_: Jailer dies n world resets
[1:38:38] Tyr3n: maybe in the next xpac they will do a better job with making your spells feel meaningful rather than having bars full of mess that is rarely used
[1:39:27] Bomber_Mayn: avid user of sheesh
[1:39:29] Narmus_: Or wait a min. In the end Jailer DOES win and he rewrites the world :D

[1:40:40] Ragnarage95: What if Azeroth wakes up and send us to a sister planet no one knows about cause we saved her so many times and dosent want to kill us
[1:40:53] Dinkyfrost: it is way too late to rest teh world before next xpac but it could of been a chance
[1:41:17] Aquadriel: i mean we have sylvannas story now, can't get worse than that really KEKW
[1:41:25] PokerFaceMoose: i mean a planet that isnt born yet somehow but still exists? im not sure having a sister planet is any crazier than that
[1:41:39] Valestrus: kill mythic jalier > get jailer's nipple as a mount
[1:42:02] king_julian_96: well whatever 10.0 ends up being after a few cosmic expansions sure 10.0 must be on azeroth

[1:42:23] Narmus_: A transformers MMO when?
[1:42:41] N3llee: so this line gets me:   Wrathion has recruited/kidnapped class trainers from all over Azeroth to train his new flight. The warlock trainer will cause some players to flip out.
[1:42:44] akia03: wouldnt 10.0 be another horde vs alli again
[1:42:46] baron_savage: What was the 10.0 leak?
[1:42:50] Galifaxs: Is it bad I got this mount first try LUL
[1:43:03] balart: just for the hand mount and cosmetic back pieces
[1:43:44] king_julian_96: probably assumign 10.0 takes place on azeroth which i think it will cause i think peopel at the moment are sick of the cosmic shit

[1:44:25] Rippan: Eternals and Captain Marvel is the two movies I don't want to rewatch :/

[2:10:23] Aervyper: Dragon Islands is already better than Shadowlands IMHO

[2:10:41] dinadreth_: This doesn't really seem like a leak but more so what someone wants to happen it feels like
[2:10:43] wetfarts99: towel everyone is playing the new monster hunter MMO

[2:12:14] Naturalbeef: Very creative leak. Nice job coming up with all of that
[2:12:21] Aidler: @towelliee this is probably a probe of Blizz to see how players react to this story
[2:12:33] Alepouditsa: i will be sad if it was truth
[2:12:38] Aervyper: Should Hire him it's better than Shadowlands
[2:12:43] pacificmc1: @Aidler lmao no
[2:12:54] Alegnowar: no he caters for smoe coll stuff, not pandering imo
[2:12:57] lalelusa: when the leaks might be better than the actual game^^
[2:12:58] warrenny: Class trainers arent even relevant anymore
[2:13:10] danimoto10: I want to get all the leaks and see what was real when the new xpac is out
[2:13:14] Aidler: swiftWait
[2:13:31] Sollice: Listen...10.0 needs to be Azeroth waking up and turning in to some planet style transformer like Unircron and then we go on a galactic war fucking up everyone
[2:13:42] Kisswani: Titan Covenants POGGERS
[2:13:47] geokouts: Man...now i have to farm WQ in Legion, Bfa and SL for money

[2:14:25] warrenny: 10.0 is prob done
[2:14:34] Heero_Effect: Could be real could be fake
[2:14:44] stokes_t: 10.0 should just use the dead zones in azeroth... im sick of them adding a whole world just for it to be abandoned next xpac
[2:15:01] WolfMan4500: its like throwing pickles on the wall of your fave fast food burger joint.  throw the pickles on the wall, and see which one stays.

[2:15:18] king_julian_96: i mean i think we can get dragon isles  but that's guys concept is probably wrong if we going to get dragon isles it will be a different story written by blizz

[2:19:01] Broomba: he plays DND - you ought to do a stream with him doing DND
[2:19:08] TheAverageGoob: Yeah I don't think blizz would put this much time into an expac
[2:19:14] Q_TheDreamer: Blizzard would never put this much effort into an xpac
[2:19:20] NonGloriaFero: I hate people who do that
[2:19:30] at1c: @TentaQles they put way more into it
[2:19:35] serbiandruglordx: When are we expecting the 10.0 cinematic?
[2:19:40] azzurrin: it's just a bunch of concept art and theory
[2:19:42] Kisswani: A for effort certainly
[2:19:48] king_julian_96: but he is right ithink we will get dragon isles eveuntally where that si 10.0 or a future expac and if it is 10.0 blizz will do it differently and have a different story

[2:26:40] SirTedric: did you test the 9.2 raid yet ? how you feeling about 9.2 think itll draw people back ? @Towelliee
[2:26:45] Sollice: Just make a multi spec class like Druid, DH, DK etc
[2:26:50] lalelusa: Azeroth "sort of" being a dragon makes sense, as proto-drakes were elementals that the keepers missed to trap in the elemental plane? I guess?
[2:26:59] Hakuho__Sho: is 9.2.5 confirmed?
[2:27:16] pacificmc1: @Arcanineh not confirmed, but Ion hinted heavily at it in an interview as he said there will be an epilogue to 9.2
[2:27:35] Sollice: 9.2.5 will have to be since its pre patch wont it?
[2:27:43] Sollice: err pre expansion patch

[2:28:12] SirTedric: 10.0 has leaks already ? whats being said? srry if youre repeating yourself
[2:28:23] pacificmc1: @Tedric dragon isles basically
[2:28:25] Sollice: @joeg433 Unless they pull that rabbit out of the hat they have said nothing for allied races
[2:28:28] NonGloriaFero: Should we just not get hype for anything until next expansion? I feel like thats the only time they can really wow us
[2:28:34] JamesRyanXF: towelliee is wow fun again? :D
[2:28:39] king_julian_96: 10.0  could be still be  this year if they have a shortened beta and alpha and realese it in december

[2:29:34] TheUnknowing: we havent even hit 2 years of shadowlands yet, i know its felt like forever though. but i wouldnt be too worried about 10.0 even coming out this year, early 2023 would be reasonable

[2:30:21] king_julian_96: reason why i think 10.0 will still be this year is cause blizz never said 2023 they said it would be this year 2202

[2:30:40] Bugszy: back in the day frost was tanking with old dks
[2:30:40] Heero_Effect: I think DK needs work done.
[2:30:45] at1c: With the new 2h mace that consumes souls from 9.2 DK is going to be fun

[2:31:55] warrenny: 3 runes was kinda interesting
[2:32:48] king_julian_96: 10.0 i meant 10.0
[2:32:58] AlphasaurusRexx: just tuned in, what do you hate more and more?
[2:33:11] shale93: I always liked frost but it seems like its the same spec for like past 6 years with no changes

[2:35:36] Genie3251: best part of this dungeon is the seagulls
[2:35:38] RealMelorandor: Blizzard's dirty laundry is out in the open and its magnified by how shit Shadowlands is. I mean, you can say its morally wrong to play LoL or any Bethesda game.
[2:35:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: seagulls stop it now
[2:35:56] Mallaes: 🐦
[2:36:12] Nehcrom: I still remember all the legion dungeons played the heck out of them. Can't say them same for BFA and SL.

[3:08:02] WentzFresh: Garrisons 2.0 incoming.
[3:08:02] Darwoo: hows AoC looking? not been keeping up
[3:08:06] falldrgn: that has some potential.. as long as its per player.. and not per faction
[3:08:38] Kisswani: that would be funny for AoC to advertise itself as the "next gen " MMO only to have WoW steal the idea and do it in 10.0 KEKW
[3:08:53] enviouscat: That sounds like a cool idea
[3:09:05] Tymian: that idea of black dragon playable race is kinda great as you could look like any race + dragonish customization
[3:09:29] Sephirothxz: Gotta say the 10.0 last leak its one of the most well written and actually accurate
[3:09:30] disorder17: I prefer new class than race ;d

[3:21:52] Darwoo: why do they have two of the same company?

[3:53:39] gladdyy: it's in cincy
[3:53:51] darkside72: yep in Cincy
[3:53:53] chessboxin34: cincy is inconsistent, thats not a crazy bet
[3:54:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Bengals haven't won a playoff game since the 90's lol
[3:54:28] darkside72: Not really confident in any teams this year to be honest.
[3:54:33] moneybags133: cincys o line  is bad and thier defense is  avrage at best  if  you can take chase out of the equation you beat them
[3:54:42] ryanc1124: I took Portland over the Nets and Kings over the Cavs the othe rnight for a 1600 cashout, kings lost by 1. lmao
[3:54:45] Defocus: ya but you forget the raider curse they do well the first 3 quarters then blow leads into the 4th

[3:55:32] darkside72: This quest blows
[3:55:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://www.mybookie.ag/sportsbook/nfl/super-bowl/
[3:56:14] Bayne77: and also, cincy destroyed raiders earlier this year.  so theres that
[3:56:15] instant_savage: not a chance
[3:56:19] chessboxin34: if youre betting on underdog to win the sb, the pats are probably your best bet
[3:56:27] Defocus: if raiders win the super bowl they better get jon gruden back while they at it LUL
[3:56:42] JohnStocktonsShorts: @chessboxin34 same with the raiders I think LUL that changes this weekend though, at least for one team
[3:56:58] darkside72: Packers, Chiefs look good. but it's really open this year, not a favorite.
[3:57:11] moneybags133: as long as tampa and  the chiefs are out of the super bowl  ill be happy to watch whoever makes it
[3:57:23] instant_savage: no patriots either
[3:57:27] chessboxin34: @JohnStocktonsShorts not sure which message youre replying to haha. inconsistency? yeah thats true
[3:57:32] moneybags133: @darkside72 i think the titans can beat the chiefs

[3:58:19] cahoots82: 680k... I couldn't keep going with that amount of money sitting in front of me for the taking
[3:58:19] Twigz_KC: Henry will definately be back
[3:58:21] darkside72: @moneybags133 Anyone can beat anyone really this year.
[3:58:28] moneybags133: @Twigz_KC  titans are getting henrey back and julio and a few others the chiefs have been above avrage  this year
[3:59:07] chessboxin34: he runs high too
[3:59:19] Acidwalk: Chubb is a beast
[3:59:34] dewking93: I thought he had a top of foot injury ?
[3:59:43] duffluv22: If Dak can come back...anything can happen. Jacobs was a beast though
[3:59:43] JSizzles36: I feel like as dominant as Henry is the Titans overused him.
[3:59:47] moneybags133: with him in the back field  you have to stack the box to prepare for him that leaves  the wide outs and tight ends in single covrage or  open in some cases
[4:00:05] duffluv22: Hell look at Eddie George
[4:00:20] instant_savage: fire frank riech

[4:00:48] moneybags133: gronk will be a free agent
[4:00:51] Short_Film: Allen Robinson would be nice, Chicago wasted him
[4:00:52] darkside72: Every payoff team had periods this season where they looked great and they also had bad beats from horrible teams, so it's wide open.

[4:01:31] satinxdd: They won’t wanna play with Carson xD

[4:28:08] KaisenSiru: monkaHmm

[4:28:30] MessyZerg: highly suspish
[4:28:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: invite to asmon lair
[4:28:38] Ivoree: some of it is legit
[4:28:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: At least this one says the new class is going to have a tank spec
[4:28:55] CaptainJoeyNY: Wildstar wut

[4:29:53] CaptainJoeyNY: its been like 6 years but yeah
[4:29:57] bypized: Gotcha
[4:30:01] rilsolo: org i think not sure about sw
[4:30:02] ralecgos: they still look old to me
[4:30:06] KaisenSiru: Cata yea
[4:30:32] Mecabeast: a tinker class would be hard to do because engineering is a profession imo

[4:30:32] h00rayforstuff: a lot of this just seems obvious? Like, yeah, shadowlands will become the default leveling experience with the next expac. And we've seen updated building models already.
[4:30:44] ralecgos: the WOONZZZZ
[4:30:45] Kisswani: the woons POGGERS
[4:30:45] WhiteKnight74648: HEAL THE WOUNDS

[4:31:41] Bayne77: anduin always feels defeated and depressed
[4:31:41] Thoreya: Bfa m+ should be up always
[4:31:42] itsapaul: King Turalyon Pog
[4:31:44] Glisur85: So what probably happened is there was a real leak and Blizzard is just putting out all kinds of nonsense so nobody knows what the real one is
[4:31:45] CaptainJoeyNY: This all sounds good as fuck
[4:31:47] reggiepowa: nice fan fic
[4:31:47] Sayryn: No sky whales. Fake news.
[4:31:53] Vch001: Genns gonna choke a bitch
[4:31:54] Kisswani: I like that alliance stuff tbh
[4:31:55] Rudric_Ice: how many leaks are there ?
[4:32:02] CaptainJoeyNY: agreedfd
[4:32:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: It sounds plausible
[4:32:15] ralecgos: it's a pretty good leak depending on how well the story gets told
[4:32:20] m3rk_zion: I could believe this "leak"
[4:32:20] Defocus: i was sold on the tinkerer
[4:32:20] Thoreya: Seems the most reasonably
[4:32:25] h00rayforstuff: so light expac is set up for 11.0
[4:32:26] azzurrin: Doesn't work? PUT IT IN!
[4:32:40] Mecabeast: tinker class is in every leak
[4:32:41] TheAverageGoob: Yeah it seems to the point and condensed like they didn't do research, but someone told them
[4:32:50] brewgamingtv: I want tinkerer really bad, but not as dps/tank. I want tank/healer
[4:33:07] ralecgos: i love how it says "N'zoth did not die" how ambiguous
[4:33:10] CaptainJoeyNY: possible leak
[4:33:10] lalelusa: Announcement in March, then alpha in late summer, betalate fall/early winter und release late in Q1 2023? could be
[4:33:12] Aquadriel: 3/10 for this one, doesnt mention Alexstrasza's tits
[4:33:13] Kisswani: Mechanic Kappa much better
[4:33:25] WhiteKnight74648: Confirmed leak. Azoroth will be a bowl of fruit. Kappa
[4:33:27] cahoots82: C'mon WoW. Gimme dat Wildstar Engineer!
[4:33:33] Mecabeast: I was going off like every expansion people say tinker class coming
[4:33:34] Jarwerewolf: lul
[4:33:36] rilsolo: take it thats a month of lost ark right?
[4:33:44] Defocus: waiting for a microsoft paint photo of the new maps to be leaked Kappa

[4:33:50] Broomba: that look
[4:33:51] Fleshtotem: nvm it died
[4:33:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think ideally a new class would have tank, healer, and dps specs....but we saw with Demon Hunter sometimes they can't do it all
[4:33:54] wildwittra: dungeons and raids mentioned ?
[4:34:05] dracullus: I love when leaks mention things we already knew to sound more credible
[4:34:08] GiiGa07: i doubt someone leaks so much Details in discord
[4:34:10] pacificmc1: KEKW
[4:34:13] Trekxx: can i get a link to that thread? i just got here i want to read it
[4:34:19] pacificmc1: https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2613098-ROTA-10-0-Rise-of-the-Aspects-LEAK
[4:34:23] Lamspread: some of it seems legit?
[4:34:24] Aquadriel: cant reveal expansion until after the major lore plot of SL is done. aka SoFo last fight @Towelliee
[4:34:26] Trekxx: thank you
[4:34:32] Kittastrophe: regardless im into it. let the copium flow
[4:34:35] Defocus: they got nothing to lose
[4:34:36] Daddyknut: johhny cash?
[4:34:37] h00rayforstuff: lol is the leaker Cash?
[4:34:37] Kisswani: Afrasiabi Kappa
[4:34:41] Jarwerewolf: sus
[4:34:42] pacificmc1: @Towelliee I just googled and they do have a senior level designer position recently opened
[4:34:46] ArcaneSyntax: not a single leak this far out has ever been true
[4:34:54] Heero_Effect: I should write a leak for  you to highlight ;)
[4:34:54] ralecgos: @Towelliee What do you think will happen with the level cap in future expansion? This leak is saying it will go to 70... then what? Squish it all again one day?
[4:35:00] Zivs: This guy says they will add a BFA Timewalking raid when they haven't even added one for MoP Timewalking yet 🤔
[4:35:03] SkyIexs: can we have a link to this one?
[4:35:09] ArcaneSyntax: like every actual leak has been from live event staff.
[4:35:17] phantom0803: The fact that the dude just shat there and elaborated with all these very fine points in a discord conversation
[4:35:23] TheAverageGoob: ROTA
[4:35:25] h00rayforstuff: use the forge to reset them
[4:35:26] rilsolo: nzoth gives them the powers back Kappa
[4:35:29] xideontv: just reset the god damn world
[4:35:31] Sarkerius: Worse... If its true. it shouldn't be hard to track this former employee down and nail them with their NDA
[4:35:34] mayonaes: Tinkerer sounds like a shaman with a tank spec...
[4:35:39] Gingerprimer: Annoucment 2 days after week 2 of the raid sound unlikely due to loosing the freed advertsing they get from the WF race
[4:35:50] Defocus: just give me Alexstrasza
[4:35:50] phantom0803: Im legit for that tinker class though
[4:35:58] Mecabeast: wouldn't the forge of origination have the power to give the aspects back their power?
[4:36:03] dracullus: Dragon Isles, Tinker, some new mode, you can't get more generic
[4:36:05] herraticc: What did their eyes do?
[4:36:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah this one seems doable
[4:36:21] iRage1776: ive been telling my friends they need to have an expansion where we help the aspects get their powers back some how, and I'm glad that's a possibility now
[4:36:23] Wranglicon: tinkerer would bring me back
[4:36:26] KingSlayerYotam: sounds too good to be true D:
[4:36:26] phantom0803: yeah Im for this, and make their ranged dps class like hella squish
[4:36:30] SilkeySmooth: imagine wasting a class spot on a tinker..lol
[4:36:32] rilsolo: nah knowing the players luck it will be like gazlowe from hots KEKW
[4:36:35] brewgamingtv: i want trinker as a healer tho lol
[4:36:38] danimoto10: lol
[4:36:41] DrWraithjr: LUL
[4:36:43] dragonkatz: LUL
[4:36:52] pacificmc1: KEKW
[4:36:56] Aidler: always thought they need to do something extraordinary for 10.0… but well…
[4:37:00] MrGattz: id honestly be really disappointed if we didnt see a world changing new planet type of thing for 10.0
[4:37:04] rohdey: its all the coke
[4:37:05] phantom0803: just spewing info to unreliable people lol
[4:37:07] Kisswani: or one chatty dev Kappa
[4:37:11] JuggernautFPS: can u farm these elites on 1 toon for the mount @Towelliee
[4:37:11] darexyy: damn i just tuned in there was another leak?
[4:37:16] dracullus: Ion shitposting on random discords
[4:37:17] lalelusa: Tinkerer, but make it not race-bound but professions-bound. Only Engineers can become a Tinkerer
[4:37:20] belfastcl: the same guy writing all the leaks, so people end up buying into the general theme, not the details
[4:37:32] Aquadriel: JuggernautFPS kill them 1 per char per day
[4:37:33] phantom0803: ON...MY...WAY
[4:37:38] Eviltuna13: Gnome and goblin only class?
[4:37:39] NickLeonhearth: YO, IG OT A LEAK! a previous CEO o the company messaged me in facebook leaking info!
[4:37:45] CaptainJoeyNY: I think  recycling and progressing original azeroth zones for future Xpans is a good idea. With chromie timewalking, they can do whatever they want and use phasing to progress it after your done leveling
[4:37:46] at1c: Your telling me your Disc dont have any Devs?
[4:37:52] pacificmc1: I mean to me it seems realisitic, it seems they are recruiting new senior level designer for WoW too, maybe to replace this guy
[4:37:58] henchan1: link the leak
[4:38:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's too close to change much
[4:38:21] phantom0803: yeah if its to release in the fall like their usual schedule
[4:38:23] lalelusa: Tinker has been discussed since Mechagon in BfA
[4:38:26] phantom0803: they arent dropping whole concept idea
[4:38:38] CaptainJoeyNY: Isnt that what GoT showrunners did?
[4:38:42] deadman385: Your a towel
[4:38:46] Gingerprimer: No wonder game is having problems if devs are only hanging out in discords
[4:38:46] tb3763: Do you really think with everything blizzard has had going on / all the shit they had to pivot to in the last year, that they have actually started the next Xpac??
[4:38:56] Kisswani: if you believe reddit , they can do full CGI cinematis in 2 days in case of emergencies and bad PR Kappa
[4:39:07] Lamspread: @buxton1919 for sure
[4:39:12] darexyy: New class?
[4:39:14] Coldfire989: @captainjoeyny they ran out of source material and showed they are crappy writers themselves
[4:39:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The development cycle starts years and years out
[4:39:26] Aquadriel: buxton1919 they start working on expansions right as one launches bro. they have 2 teams
[4:39:29] h00rayforstuff: void naruu
[4:39:29] Kisswani: Dark Naaru POGGERS
[4:39:30] phantom0803: looks new
[4:39:31] ralecgos: i see that all the time
[4:39:32] chavodk: it is rare
[4:39:33] chavodk: kinda
[4:39:35] phantom0803: never seen that one
[4:39:36] Wcvechten: one of the bosses changes daily
[4:39:40] Mecabeast: one of the possible spawns of 4 available per day
[4:39:40] Aidler: apple would leak 10 different concepts to confuse people…. but they can afford it
[4:39:40] Jabells: @Towelliee what is your opinion on 9.2 tier sets
[4:39:41] Aquadriel: @Towelliee every day a different boss appears on the arena
[4:39:46] lalelusa: part of the event. kill all the bosses and get an achievement
[4:39:55] gold9871: event
[4:39:58] Aquadriel: a naaru, a succubabe, a big dino.
[4:40:01] bumpstock75: necro daily boss
[4:40:03] tb3763: @Towelliee When would you think next Xpac comes out? Mid 2024??
[4:40:10] Defocus: the paladin ones are complete garbage no one cares about light of dawn and judgement
[4:40:10] phantom0803: you dont like the pala one!!!???!!!
[4:40:12] Kisswani: Bunny lock AYAYA Clap
[4:40:12] Gingerprimer: Paladin is cool but only in M+
[4:40:12] Moodiir: not only are they working on 10.0 i can almsot guarantee they started working on 11.0
[4:40:14] azzurrin: The grand wizard LOL
[4:40:20] mayonaes: next xpac will come out this year
[4:40:25] mayonaes: for sure
[4:40:36] Rudric_Ice: Dks gonna be everywhere next patch
[4:40:40] Wcvechten: this one can also drop the dog mount
[4:40:42] jacooners: man do i play huntard or tinkerer
[4:40:54] Pansarpatrik: @towelliee  what do you think will be the tank meta for 9.2?
[4:41:12] Mecabeast: Feb '23 for 10.0
[4:41:12] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[4:41:12] tb3763: @mayonaes theres no shot
[4:41:15] MrGattz: if they make 10.0 a filler then yeah it will be out by nov. if its a full blown mega xpac then maybe late next year mid next year
[4:41:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: alpha would need to start really soon for a 2022 release
[4:41:23] Cochese_: DK's gonna be boosted somehow?
[4:41:31] Aquadriel: with omicron deez nuts, you can expect their work flow get affected again, even a lil bit @Towelliee
[4:41:50] rensdeamo: Yh - they are doing 10.0 atm - Quest team is done with 9.2 - so is Dungeon team. They parallel develop. 10.0 will be Dec - Christmas sale ..
[4:42:00] Trekxx: ^
[4:42:09] azzurrin: 10.0 Q1 of 2023
[4:42:19] ralecgos: do you think wow will ever change their engine or just keep building on it like they have been
[4:42:20] rensdeamo: Nop - Dec 2022
[4:42:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: The end of November would be good, I think
[4:42:23] Aquadriel: like 5 dude, you are good KEKW
[4:42:35] Jarwerewolf: new  class super sus
[4:42:35] Rudric_Ice: 2 years of SL DansGame
[4:42:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: they can't drop the ball with this one though, another shadowlands would be bad overall
[4:42:46] Masterglint: you think we only getting 3 tiers for this expac?
[4:42:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Launching before Christmas is more money hehehehe
[4:43:02] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee what if they have no alpha/beta and then we cant say we gave them feedback to change stuff #bigbrain
[4:43:04] Defocus: i hope to god we are done with borrowed powers etc
[4:43:08] mavericks312: id rather them take there time and make a polished xpac
[4:43:09] phantom0803: thjats confirmed lol
[4:43:11] mayonaes: yeah they said 9.2 is the end
[4:43:24] Masterglint: oh wow
[4:43:34] bionicbeechy: is there a mythic mount in the new raid?
[4:43:35] Aquadriel: you already kill 4 different ones
[4:43:55] Mecabeast: dude on the boar didn't count tho pretty sure
[4:44:09] onybear: I don’t think it is going to be till next year, I don’t think they want a repeat of shadowlands and with covid and everything else
[4:44:23] rensdeamo: 9.1.5 was ready but delayed cause of "great push" - came out right after. And right after 9.2 was annouced - because it was almost ready
[4:44:32] Aquadriel: you killed drake and this twice already.
[4:44:49] meijer32: 10.0 sounds good LUL
[4:45:02] Hayon5: WOLTK will tank 10.0 developpement
[4:45:04] Aquadriel: They spawn in this order: Pit lord > Drake > lava giant > daily special,
[4:45:09] shinas: estimated duration of 9.3? LUL
[4:45:14] xideontv: they'll take their time to test it, have it perfected it and still find a way to fuck up the expansion
[4:45:18] rensdeamo: My bet 9.2 in Feb - 10.0 in Dec - 2022
[4:45:20] Xsilentghost: no way 10.0 is coming out this year. it needs more time
[4:45:30] bypized: @Towelliee is 10.0 going to be their ´´redemption´´ for WoW?
[4:45:37] Mecabeast: there's like 6 total that drop but only 4 of 6 are up a day or something like that
[4:45:39] shinas: 9.2*
[4:45:42] CaptainJoeyNY: 5-7 is that accurate?
[4:45:54] Aquadriel: people thinking classic needs development KEKW
[4:46:05] Kisswani: real cause of retail drought , classic development Kappa
[4:46:07] Thasin22: Cant wait for youtube to show me the 8 billionth video of accolon next xpan leak!! shock face.
[4:46:25] rensdeamo: Mark my words: 9.2 in Feb - 10.0 in Dec - 2022 You heard it here !!
[4:46:40] shinas: no way 10.0 comes out this year
[4:46:41] DeanoTV: they can take their time with 10.0, WOTLK will fill in for drought
[4:47:03] tb3763: Everything you are saying is under normal circumstances, not during a massive Company lawsuit, multiple walk outs / strikes and a Pandemic. I wouldnt be surprised if they dont have an Xpac till 2024
[4:47:08] Jarwerewolf: same here
[4:47:09] CommanderRudolph: Just ask in the one you're already in Kappa
[4:47:22] Rudric_Ice: all leaks on mmo champion ?
[4:47:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath is probably going to be an off-year thing.,...they know there is this cycle of players coming and going for expansions
[4:47:42] Jarwerewolf: @buxton1919  put on it  money
[4:47:44] nightshadewoww: Any link for that mmo champ  post ?
[4:47:45] tb3763: Slightly
[4:47:45] Sylnus: 2024 LUL
[4:47:45] AmericanFat: im starting to like this streamer more and more
[4:47:46] Hayon5: I mean WOLTK Classic will be released so they can take more time to developpe 10.0 ?
[4:47:46] rensdeamo: @shinas What do u bet ?
[4:47:56] tb3763: RIOT isnt in as bad of a spot as Activision.
[4:48:05] queeflabs: define spot
[4:48:06] Mecabeast: and a netflix series
[4:48:07] Jabells: Developers dont do lawsuits..
[4:48:15] PoppaMetal: Devs dont deal with lawsuits
[4:48:17] Rulem: I think it will come out this year; at the very least, it will be on sale.  Acitivision will be looking for a Q3-Q4 boost
[4:48:20] Aquadriel: buxton1919 only because people love hating on ATVI lol
[4:48:22] bypized: Activision is just an older company
[4:48:24] shinas: granted they only "farted" on ppl LUL
[4:48:24] itsapaul: Riot was the exact same stuff, same agencies
[4:48:28] AmericanFat: RIOT is doing insanely good, stocks are going UP high, Arcane season 1 was giving RIOT a biig boost
[4:48:44] warrenny: @shinas Your joking right?

[4:48:45] KingSlayerYotam: dude game dev dont mess with lawsuits, thats legal. Do people have no idea how stuff works?
[4:48:47] rilsolo: not really i think most were shocked but quickly got passed it
[4:48:50] bypized: Where in what world a lawsuit stops an office to stop working, besides major termination or strikes
[4:48:56] itsapaul: Devs dont double as company lawyers LUL
[4:49:00] shinas: @warrenny i wish dude LUL
[4:49:09] CaptainJoeyNY: it does when seinor level designers keep leaving
[4:49:25] 24sevn: what will delay 10.0 is omricon :)
[4:49:31] tb3763: I dont play WoW anymore, just nostalgia at this point. But it just seems like Activison as a whole is in shambles. The COD side is also not doing well, RavenSoft is having issues now as well.
[4:49:32] AmericanFat: lets be real, its just like 5 evil harrsament dudes in blizzard, while blizzard is a company of like 5000 employees... People need to know they are hating the wrong people

[4:56:27] Gingerprimer: My friends in 4th grade sold boosts for RFC leveling
[4:56:27] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: boosts make people not want to actually play, they just want to be carried. so they remain mediocre

[4:56:37] officialviz: Boosting supports raiders and is a waybto save real money, change my mind
[4:56:38] warrenny: @poisonouslotus802 If they pay gold who gives a fucj

[4:57:30] Sneekzx: Who gives a fuck about boosting... the only people who complain about it are the ones who can't afford it. I'd rather make money and spend it to boost than lvl a 4th 60.
[4:57:36] xhale2nhale: idc who boosts or get boosted, don't bother my gameplay
[4:57:42] wrhashwizard: @warrenny oh i know bud, no worries

[4:58:25] ralecgos: boost if you want, i just wish they had their own tab in the group finder tool
[4:58:38] MaliceAlice84: I'm just tired of people always bashing the game. At the end of the day we have all been playing for a long time and I really hope they turn it around. I've loved this game for over 15 years its been a big part of my life.
[4:58:43] beatsbyeliot: Leader of Blizzard playing WoW is good for WoW in general LUL
[4:58:46] officialviz: Ion does raid lead
[4:58:48] xhale2nhale: yea when I saw that post, I had to check it out
[4:58:51] smokingcactus: so my buddy gets banned for helping people get KSM and streaming it but yet boosters can stream boosts and do gold trades and not get shit
[4:58:53] phantom0803: I like the concept of boosting as an income generator but I dislike what it takes away from the game.  It allows the community to fall apart a bit cause you can just pay to win
[4:58:55] School_Toilets: Ion stopped raiding
[4:58:59] literalmountgod: LUL
[4:59:01] pronkk_: emote only whole time
[4:59:02] tapuffnstuff: some people craft some people raid. raiders boost crafters crafters boost raiders its simple economics
[4:59:03] OhNoNotAgain: Emote only chat for Ion
[4:59:04] phantom0803: 'win'
[4:59:04] neo_0098: why do you keep shitting on the casual players? because they re not worth it?
[4:59:05] Mecabeast: ion would have sub more or emote mode on perma
[4:59:05] serbiandruglordx: Ion is a goated dev for sure
[4:59:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah he would have to turn chat off lol
[4:59:11] m3rk_zion: @CrusaderNero I think it's a mixture of no sleep and trying to code for a discord bot LUL
[4:59:13] officialviz: Elitist Jerks got CE ye his guild
[4:59:20] Rulem: the ESO lead streams almost every day
[4:59:29] Jarwerewolf: lol
[4:59:30] xhale2nhale: Ion prob raid at home but keep it away from Twitch
[4:59:33] warrenny: Imagine the toxic shitshow ions chat would be
[4:59:54] xhale2nhale: yea I remember those days, now they got Legacy n still crying
[4:59:58] NeverStopRaging1: dam preach is killing it rn

[5:00:57] Quecklain: [X] doubt
[5:01:01] smokingcactus: LFR is the real Mythic content
[5:01:07] Quecklain: @Pubstar_LTD true Kappa
[5:01:18] jacooners: your respond like that and they will keep doing it
[5:01:18] Mecabeast: wonder if the people in Mike's guild get a discount for their sub
[5:01:21] Suligane: what about a new engine for 10.0? i was looking forward to that
[5:01:31] RageerPLZ: 689 attempts for mythic Sylvanas, finally doing re clears now.
[5:01:33] fletch8: LFR FTW
[5:01:34] vic_ave: Lfr Kel'thuzad is the worse experience known to man
[5:01:40] phantom0803: I think they should take LFR on the last patch of the expansion and boost it to heroic difficulty
[5:01:40] Heero_Effect: Why do people hate LFR? I mean if you are just wanting to see the story it’s chill?
[5:01:51] xideontv: its only the first kill of the day

[5:04:34] Heero_Effect: I think it would help them balance/bug fix raids too less stuff to do
[5:04:46] Rulem: yeah, I agree.  I also would love to see mythic drop to like 12; 1 spot per class
[5:04:57] neo_0098: What is the legion mission addon called?

[6:06:16] Sarkerius: did I miss the draw?
[6:06:17] Sam_Nash: @91niki me too it's like galactus
[6:06:17] Vigi9413: or just make survival hunters a tank
[6:06:23] chrslp: @LawrenceDreamer There is. Just watch Shrek
[6:06:31] Rudric_Ice: they need to add a shaman tank spec like an Earthwarder or something
[6:06:32] Bluelocks: should be a caster, theres enough melee
[6:06:45] LawrenceDreamer: @chrslp true :P
[6:06:46] ZillasaurusOG: mushroom burger and cauliflower grits sounds so pog
[6:06:46] AlphasaurusRexx: @Vigi9413 0 people want that. relax

[6:06:58] ZakuzaGB: you just become that dude your killing now but a tank
[6:07:00] Velladyn: a new class is necessary, at this point there needs to be to hype up anything
[6:07:02] Cole88: they could have a tank spec that tanks with a robot that you create
[6:07:18] SilkeySmooth: i wont play if there is a tinker class
[6:07:18] t_train_va: 49ers are as well, so I'll be there
[6:07:20] phantom0803: i want a full fledge combat mage, like GLASS cannon melee
[6:07:23] Tripzdh: today is nzoth in the amphitheater if you still need it @Towelliee
[6:07:27] jxxpn: Next year XD
[6:07:27] Sielu11628: DH, DK, and Monk all had Melee/Tank options. Next class should be a caster/healer IMO
[6:07:28] yulelogged: @Cole88 I agree man tinkerer would be sick, like the engineer from WildStar with bots and such
[6:07:52] ZakuzaGB: @Velladyn i disagree i think just adding stuff for the current classes like in legion more class fantasy new talents maybe add a new spec or something
[6:07:52] SilkeySmooth: just give hunters turrets there is your tinker class..lol
[6:07:57] Cole88: @yulelogged yeah man. imagine a tank spec for it too like let us create a robot pet type thing that would tank with or for us
[6:07:59] t_train_va: Was it worth it?

[6:08:42] mavericks312: well now that they play in the death star tickets shot super up
[6:08:50] yulelogged: what no it wouldnt be lol, like creating little walking bombs and stuff would be cool and as ahealer creating a healer robot that sprays heals as it runs around and stuff like that would be cool
[6:08:54] Velladyn: @ZakuzaGB there's nothing stopping them from adding that on top of a new class, two teams working on new class design and one working on current class additions
[6:09:00] Sollice: Thats because Mark Davis spends a fortune hiring someone who agree's to cut his stupid haircut
[6:09:02] LawrenceDreamer: @Towelliee did you do any rated pvp this season?
[6:09:03] yulelogged: then you can throw healing grenades and stuff like that

[6:12:32] Sollice: @Doebyy about what
[6:12:32] theDirtyon3: yeah its all just a money grab

[6:53:25] School_Toilets: It is account wide
[6:53:33] School_Toilets: The double leg
[6:53:37] AkuTVgg: Update for Arby’s sandwich:  I had the brisket one. First few bites weren’t that bad but it def built up the level of Spicey. Pretty impressed for a fast food joint actually putting some spice into it.  They do give you a smal vanilla shake with the order to help but I didn’t need it. I have decent spice tolerance but by no means am I a champion at it
[6:53:51] ItsXolten: Good to know
[6:53:54] Phae__: I could see 252 or whatever conduits being account wide, but not max conduits at 270 w/e

[6:54:02] bertooso: Has anyone ever asked why the game can’t be more alt friendly?
[6:54:05] warrenny: On slts
[6:54:21] BoiAtomico: a cool thing they could update is allowing you to have all the professions in 1 char D:

[6:54:40] Galifaxs: I’ve been wanting Indian food a lot recently, dipping the bread in curry is so great
[6:54:42] t_train_va: And they bring it out with hazmat gloves
[6:54:47] warrenny: No way it ever happens @theatomicram
[6:55:09] Autoexeq: OMG ! Three mounts in 14 minutes LUL
[6:55:15] warrenny: Alt friendly vs no content
[6:55:17] AkuTVgg: Yeah for sure.  My comment was it was spicier than your average “hit spice 5 alarm challenge” you see at most big chain places
[6:55:21] RednazCG: Hey hey, it's 108 attempts so far :D
[6:55:34] BoiAtomico: @warrenny It wouldn't. The people who farm already have alts with every profession, the people who don't farm still buy stuff from those peeps on the AH. It would just avoid most people logging in and out
[6:55:42] a23pk: I don't play much anymore, but I love coming here and still experiencing the game through @Towelliee and the community. So, thanks boss.

[6:57:24] warrenny: I stop at naster
[6:57:33] ItsXolten: I'll sell 20 NW all day
[6:57:37] thedr8993: ksm is so free though
[6:57:45] BoiAtomico: try playing solo with no guild for raiding on a new char, can't even get in a +7 due to lack of rating LUL
[6:57:48] warrenny: @chie_gaming Not really try pugging it
[6:57:50] MoistyBlizz: +20 isnt that hard, I rarely play mythic keys and got 2k rated I got 6 =20 timed done so far for the season
[6:57:52] JasonEdge666: @towelliee $120 off what? I don’t see what the code is for
[6:57:59] phantom0803: can you get it the normal way?
[6:58:01] sotsil_: its a decent time investment
[6:58:02] Knocx: Knocx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[6:58:03] phantom0803: like getting 15's
[6:58:07] Thoreya: I think people just want account wide for everything
[6:58:09] Thoreya: Which I get
[6:58:12] masterlee05: @TheAtomicRam that's why i quti wow
[6:58:12] thedr8993: but on the level of elite pvp or cutting edge raid?.
[6:58:15] thedr8993: ?
[6:58:29] Knocx: woot
[6:58:35] Mecabeast: Def not if you kept up with dungeons from the start sure but jumping in mid or late patch you'll sit forever waiting to get into a group
[6:58:47] ItsXolten: I thought ksm was staying at 2k?
[6:58:48] warrenny: Ksm took me like 5 months this patch
[6:58:50] Phae__: KSM is pretty easy if you're decent at the game, but you're overestimating the casual population. Go do a +5 or a +8 when people are pushing +20s and higher, and you'll find that most people struggle to even time low keys
[6:58:52] jentboom: You jsut cant do a 20 dawg its ok man just say it
[6:58:53] gali5656: is there gonna be an alternate way to farm 278 conduits besides the 3 aforementioned ways?
[6:59:01] Layliah79: normally end of xpac we're a bit OP anyways
[6:59:25] phantom0803: I marched through my 15
[6:59:28] phantom0803: 15
[6:59:43] Heero_Effect: Grind it out
[6:59:47] thedr8993: if you tie it to ksm though you may as well change the other achievement to AOTC
[6:59:47] ItsXolten: 20s aren't that hard 5 million would be radicicolous
[6:59:51] phantom0803: 15's in this season so easily it was very very simple with the powers and weeks
[6:59:56] Eraste: pugging m+ oof
[6:59:57] Benjaminoo_: bigger dick
[7:00:01] MoistyBlizz: filthy casuals will bitch about anything though.. so where does it end?
[7:00:04] warrenny: @awesum_rosum Its that low?
[7:00:07] AkuTVgg: Are there not other slower 1 by 1 ways to level them to max?  This just seems like a faster way for those who have the skill
[7:00:08] Aquadriel: but event hen is not like conduits add that much power
[7:00:14] warrenny: @awesum_rosum howd uou check
[7:00:23] bestplayereu99: where is the leak?

[7:00:42] SirVoro: Thats actually way too true holy shit I never thought of it like that LOL
[7:00:54] Narktali: no
[7:00:56] awesum_rosum: Raider io has a S2 M+ cutoff thing
[7:00:58] MoistyBlizz: casual cry babies, want CE and all the max tier gear just for logging in... its insane to cater to the causals
[7:01:01] mrniceguy817: Getting a 20 is prob pretty “ez” with a group but when you only solo pug m+ that’s when it’s annoying
[7:01:17] Feduar: Shadehound dropped today
[7:01:21] jentboom: for title
[7:01:25] Zivs: It's for the title for top 0.1% or w.e
[7:01:27] phantom0803: Thats literally it, casual want the game for themselves, (as a casual) i feel the game should have its challenges and higher end tier shit. if a player cant get KSM or CE then you cant... its not meant for everyone
[7:01:44] denflup: u think the leggo system will carry  into 10.0?
[7:01:56] awesum_rosum: it just has the achievements .1%------->do you have all 5s done
[7:01:58] warrenny: @aruar89 No way

[7:02:17] persianman77: So is the gm gonna be ur cotank
[7:02:18] AmericanFat: im an elitist, fuck all casuals, they can go play super mario if they dont want difficulty LUL
[7:02:21] Eraste: as a casual that quit the game, its frustrating because thats the only content in the game.. if there was decent casual content, a lot of people would care less
[7:02:36] futomara01: all  of  the above
[7:02:37] lithium364: but what about whale players towRee why is noone thinking about whales, i wanna buy conduits in the store towCry
[7:02:41] warrenny: @phantom0803 Exactly im happy working on ksm and curve
[7:02:44] lithium364: Kappa
[7:02:50] MoistyBlizz: @Eraste you can literally do everything as a casual what are you even talking about lol
[7:02:57] AmericanFat: :(
[7:03:03] PvtHudson093: Whats wrong with getting it at AOTC/KSM/whatever the PVP equivilent is
[7:03:05] Red_Queen____: *shakes cane*
[7:03:06] AmericanFat: you look 30
[7:03:06] TheDabbai: imagine they started tying power reward gains to Trial of Style, people be mogging their butts off

[7:03:18] Eraste: @Eraste ya okay one month of stuff per 8 month patch cycle then nothing to keep interested in after...
[7:03:19] Zippaya: yup, kids now days are faaaast
[7:03:20] seyhulud: Hi friends, it may sound strange, but I haven't played wow before and I'm thinking of starting, but the people around me are saying that the game is over, is this true?
[7:03:29] Eraste: @seyhulud stay away
[7:03:38] Ant9912: !follow
[7:03:49] warrenny: Arent most wow players older anyway
[7:03:50] Heero_Effect: @seyhulud it’s not lol
[7:03:52] seyhulud: @Eraste Why :D
[7:03:53] Jarwerewolf: you look like 20
[7:03:55] phantom0803: @warrenny its just so old seeing the game get pandered to everyone (which i get is the smart business decision) but also we as a community promote this elitist shit
[7:03:59] belfastcl: @warrenny ancient
[7:04:02] thedr8993: @seyhulud and is fine, give it a try and see what you like
[7:04:02] MoistyBlizz: wow isnt close to being dead
[7:04:08] thedr8993: game*
[7:04:12] mavericks312: @seyhulud if your a brand new player i would say give it a try
[7:04:13] dyslexican1: To me it seems a little silly to spend the time and effort to set up a system that makes things easier for a small portion of the population that already has the ability or are already willing to put the effort to get the reward anyway. Seems like a lot of effort for less overall reward.

[7:06:31] Ezekyler: you watched the last Lost Ark video @Towelliee?
[7:06:35] PvtHudson093: Casual dosnt mean bad it just means that sometimes people dont have the time to devote to grinding out revered to get double leggos or to raid Mythic or get 20+ keys
[7:06:36] MoistyBlizz: @phantom0803 bruh you sus if you think people will believe that.. NO ONE expects someone to be aotc or CE two weeks into a patch release before getting a raid inv
[7:06:38] phantom0803: @warrenny I agree with ya, its typically some smooth brainers that are just  wrapped in the that "title/rating" lifestyle.
[7:06:41] persianman77: You looking forward to new raid?
[7:06:51] Gigantor4480: I don't think the problem is casual gamers. I think the problem is casual gamers who expect to be rewarded like hardcore gamers...
[7:07:13] hotlocaldadxo: Where did you meet your girlfriend?
[7:07:33] phantom0803: @lordmoisty no one said CE, and yes their were plenty of people declining heroic raids that werent "aotc" weeks 2-3 into the tier
[7:07:53] Zippaya: dont get me wrong, I like it
[7:08:05] MoistyBlizz: @phantom0803 no there wasnt stop lying
[7:08:16] Aquadriel: factor deeznuts GOTTEM
[7:08:55] Aquadriel: ngl i might try it today
[7:09:04] Dyriks: Clap
[7:09:07] phantom0803: @lordmoisty Got nothing to gain from lying, so im going to go a head and repeat that... Yes there were plenty of listings saying "AOTC" only weeks into the content
[7:09:32] MoistyBlizz: @phantom0803 that didnt happen stop lying to strangers online.
[7:09:33] Aquadriel: the uuh smart carb thing foods seem pretty tasty

[7:10:50] cahoots82: Bruh, how can I do my WQ w/out 278 conduits?
[7:10:56] JaseLeland: but any reasonable person understand it shouldn't be like that
[7:10:57] MoistyBlizz: @phantom0803 I was and im CE and AOTC for both tiers in shadowlands.. I know that didn't happen. stop lying lol
[7:10:58] Frostfury: Curve or not invite Kappa simple as that
[7:11:07] BoiAtomico: the problem all started when they started giving out participation medals so everyone felt included

[7:12:31] MoistyBlizz: @phantom0803 it didnt happen lol idc what he says, people were not expecting aotc a couple weeks into this tier.. it didn't happen..
[7:12:38] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @Donzie but thats kinda real life dude
[7:12:56] Nehcrom: lol nice clip about wow is dead on reddit... That being said man the redditors do not like towel really toxic comments.

[7:14:25] theegoomba: what are you talking about they shit talk preach and bell constantly
[7:14:42] PvtHudson093: I hate that there isnt tier set tokens
[7:14:43] Aquadriel: bitches dont know homie towel has his contacts and been doing this shit for years
[7:14:44] Zivs: yeah it was you making fun of people saying wow is dying
[7:14:48] phantom0803: @PvtHudson093 The time gating portion is just because the 1 percent will crackhead no life the game and would just burn up sub times. With how long it took to release content they would lose waaaay too many subs in this expansion
[7:14:51] MoistyBlizz: YEP! literally all those reddit losers suckle on bellulars delusional teets on the DOOM that is apparently coming to wow SOON(tm)

[7:20:44] Aro725: whats the guiness record?
[7:20:52] Vivelli: LUL
[7:21:04] Dyriks: how old is star citizen now?
[7:21:07] Aquadriel: COPIUM CITIZEN
[7:21:08] CaptainJoeyNY: Star citizen isnt a scam. I paid 5 bucks, I have access to everything, and I have like 30 ships in my hanger
[7:21:14] Aro725: thats awesome
[7:21:24] Nokterian: Ah yeah star citizen in development since 2013
[7:21:31] OhNoNotAgain: The real stat that matters is how long has Wildstar been subbed to Towelliee tho.
[7:21:38] Eraste: IDK, maybe ill check out 10.0, but im happy not playing blizzard games now
[7:21:50] Aro725: holy shit
[7:21:53] Nehcrom: Holy fudge, that is awesome.
[7:21:56] at1c: @Towelliee  so I heard you like WoW
[7:22:01] BoiAtomico: between ashes and star, ashes is the one who resembles chronicles of elyria the most. delays, swaps to the engine, crappy alpha and on site in game store LUL
[7:22:05] AinaTan3: "i'll play ashes in 2085" KEKW I died
[7:22:05] Zippaya: if he still trying to go for r14 it may happen tho :D
[7:22:16] belfastcl: payo is gonna break that record, on 2065 or so
[7:22:30] crazy1god: @Nokterian Like 2012 mb
[7:22:32] Shezzmou: boy talk about a guy that had all the negative news not effect his stream at all lol
[7:22:48] marlamin: posted some new maybe interesting animation names on mmoc but definitely scraping the barrel marlam1Kakapo
[7:22:48] Naturalbeef: Swifty will break out the chair to try and catch you
[7:22:52] NickLeonhearth: who is payo?
[7:22:59] BAS_Basvision: are you in the ashes alpha or beta?
[7:23:08] CardinalTX: Swiftly to positive to let the negative seep in
[7:23:13] sifer007: payo BabbayRage
[7:23:20] TheUnknowing: how could he break the record if towelliee is still streaming WoW in 2065 which clearly he will be Kappa
[7:23:20] marlamin: frontpag
[7:23:21] Towelliee: !permit marlamin
[7:23:21] Moobot: @Towelliee @marlamin will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)

[7:24:50] marlamin: i have no idea but it seems like future content
[7:24:52] Alegnowar: becouse azeroth dies
[7:24:52] ShaunsterTheMonster: ?
[7:25:00] belfastcl: it's for the world changes in the 10.0 leak
[7:25:01] Mecabeast: world ambience?
[7:25:02] saltybcn: I feel like Towelliee is the John Dutton of the WOW streaming community.
[7:25:03] ThatsProto: probably as reference to shadowlands equivalent for the force of life
[7:25:07] Knocx: WE GW2 NOW BOIS
[7:25:08] Rudric_Ice: oh shit azeroth gonna come alive
[7:25:18] madmike_99: what 10.0 leaks ?
[7:25:21] marlamin: my super wild speculation is that it  might be related to the torghast rift
[7:25:29] marlamin: but i posted about that in the speculation thread
[7:25:33] michaelmm: Living world is probably an update to Azeroth to bring it up to date.
[7:25:33] Alegnowar: chromie time for old azeroth IonJam
[7:25:36] Layliah79: Azeroth will come alive!
[7:25:41] givmeafrekinname: RIP that person trying to join the party LUL
[7:25:47] H0bbitK1ng: boss mechanics
[7:25:51] Layliah79: Maybe Pre-10.0 event!
[7:25:54] H0bbitK1ng: for last few bosses
[7:25:55] Melria: time changing?
[7:26:12] CardinalTX: Mortal Online 2 on the 25th. Dong slider will kill wow Kappa
[7:26:35] ZiggyWoWttv: Are you on the hype train of Feb 22nd patch and raid first week of march?
[7:26:55] Rowwek: is living world supposed to be world shaping that the leak mentioned?
[7:27:06] JaseLeland: who knows
[7:27:26] Shezzmou: Just now got the 2 leggos testing too
[7:27:35] PvtHudson093: tier set tunning
[7:27:57] commanderfaceless: raid week will fall on mah birthday week. cool. though im not playing wow anymore atm
[7:27:58] Mecabeast: do you think we will see a 100T Limit? or another org?
[7:28:11] mavericks312: i dont think there pressing to rush 9.2
[7:28:23] PvtHudson093: dosnt feel ready to me
[7:28:25] Aspectt10: @Towelliee  So Mid March New Expansion Annoucement?
[7:28:32] JaseLeland: feb is so loaded
[7:28:34] marlamin: art/content wise it seems there but systems, balance and feedback wise there's a lot to go imo
[7:28:41] CardinalTX: Just make it good blizz
[7:28:48] lithium364: i will 100% chose elden ring over wow
[7:28:48] Llamatude: 9.2 2/22/02 all the 2's
[7:28:57] TheUnknowing: elden ring i think is a different crowd but just depends
[7:29:06] mavericks312: lets be honest elden ring has a niche community its not gonna pull every gamer in
[7:29:06] JaseLeland: yeah, I'm beating elden ring before doing anything else around that time
[7:29:08] TheUnknowing: but i agree they should definitely wait til march for 9.2
[7:29:17] Eraste: ff14 6.1 maybe in march?
[7:29:25] CardinalTX: Haven’t even looked at it
[7:29:31] Shezzmou: Played the beta for Lost Ark and watched streams i just don't see how it's fun past a couple weeks
[7:29:56] JaseLeland: @Shezzmou lost ark has a ton of content
[7:30:06] Rudric_Ice: wish blizzard did some drops for WoW
[7:30:11] Shatraugh: Playable Black Dragon race sounds cool LUL
[7:30:19] CardinalTX: I’m not hyped at all for LA.  Just not an isometric fan
[7:30:35] Sypline_: We are going to be spoiled with LA content for the first year
[7:30:42] Dinosew: Ahhh me ears…the woons
[7:30:43] Eraste: gimmie that WASD movement danHyper
[7:31:10] Shezzmou: Not saying it doesn't have a ton of content. Gameplay wise just doesn't feel great. Yeah the movement makes it bad for me.
[7:31:17] ImNotAnNPC: sorry but whats the pink circle for?

[7:31:44] ImNotAnNPC: ah ok thanks
[7:31:46] Rudric_Ice: moba players will love that game
[7:31:46] Leystra: wonder when we will hear more about the league MMO
[7:31:49] Broomba: Lost Ark a grinder -- incoming reeeeeee on twitter
[7:31:49] JaseLeland: the gameplay is great lol
[7:31:59] TheUnknowing: i think lost ark felt amazing gameplay wise
[7:32:02] Vivelli: LA has great gameplay
[7:32:02] JaseLeland: if you don't like it, that's just a preference thing
[7:32:07] TheUnknowing: i really enjoyed lost ark beta
[7:32:09] Broomba: Lost Ark played well
[7:32:17] CardinalTX: I say not hyped buuuuuuut.   FTP so why not test the waters
[7:32:27] irebelzzz: is it hard to come back to the Game rn if ive been gone for a year ?  or is there catch up mechanics in place for it ?
[7:32:32] Namtarts_TV: oh gotta disagree on localiztion lol. but i want it in KR with ENG subtitlte sooo
[7:32:35] MoistyBlizz: wow would be the bet MMO if they added full controller support and added it to consoles... hands down would take the market from any competitor
[7:32:43] crazy1god: Me !
[7:32:46] crazy1god: XD
[7:32:49] MrKray2: i have booked a week off

[7:32:54] MoistyBlizz: I already pre ordered lost ark lol cant wait!
[7:33:03] Sypline_: Plus amazon publishing LA means huge publicity
[7:33:03] emerald27x: What are the 10.0 leaks?
[7:33:07] irebelzzz: is it hard to come back to the Game rn if ive been gone for a year ? or is there catch up mechanics in place for it ? or is lost ark going to be the game ?
[7:33:07] azanarzx: jokes on you i most likely cant afford the game
[7:33:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bezos money lol
[7:33:20] NickLeonhearth: Lost Ark...Horizon...Elden Ring, wonder if I can not work in Feb lol
[7:33:25] Eraste: ya im all in for lost ark looks fun as hell
[7:33:26] Phae__: WoW on console? Not a chance. PvP would be impossible. WoW has way too many skills and macros at high gameplay to be console portable
[7:33:26] JaseLeland: @emerald27x it's on mmo champion
[7:33:28] Red_Queen____: #storyofmylife
[7:33:47] emerald27x: @jaseleland Ty!
[7:33:54] Phae__: @irebelzzz Easiest it's been to catch up all expansion. Unlock korthia, profit
[7:33:59] Broomba: @towelliee -- question -- do you know if your origin pc cpu, gpu, etc would become outdated (if you didnt get one from them as a sponsor) would they upgrade it?
[7:34:00] sushm33: Blizzard needs to be bought by someone who'll clean up their toxic crew, thats the only way I see WoW rise again
[7:34:06] Mecabeast: @phae__ possible but def wouldn't be competitive
[7:34:19] cavers95: !facts
[7:34:29] futomara01: lost  ark is one time purchase right?
[7:34:37] Wavekingg: Wait Lost Ark is free to play? I did not know that
[7:34:43] firekingkyle: This is them looking at which model makes them the most money without making a whole new game.
[7:34:45] Maego1: f2p @futomara01
[7:34:47] JaseLeland: @futomara01 for the early access yes
[7:34:55] Phae__: @Mecabeast Have to disagree. Any classes that require a lot of multi-targeting like rogues would be basically unplayable on a controller.
[7:35:13] Broomba: my new origin pc is being shipped today @towelliee so excited
[7:35:14] its____rooster: but will it go head on into a wall like New World did not releasing content.
[7:35:16] ColdChillXI: f2p plus streamer promo is big
[7:35:18] futomara01: sweet
[7:35:36] Ninjatun4: is lost ark pay to win?

[7:35:52] hiimseejay: cant wait to play it
[7:36:03] crazy1god: All MMO is pay to win ! Get over it guys !
[7:36:04] AmericanFat: @incpermaban no
[7:36:10] Sypline_: Eastern version still isnt very P2W
[7:36:11] its____rooster: 9.2 release in March???
[7:36:14] Dyriks: man my ears are clogged, I heard "wildstar p2w?". LUL LUL
[7:36:29] Nehcrom: Pay to be a bit in front of everyone else that will catch up.
[7:36:37] Malfleur: It's not even that p2w like people think ^^
[7:36:38] azzurrin: I mean PvP is equalized so that's all the matters for P2W
[7:36:41] JaseLeland: he wants that 3090 ti
[7:36:41] Vivelli: oof
[7:36:51] Nokterian: Videocards are not cheap LUL
[7:36:53] CaptainJoeyNY: I need a new gaming laptop, my 2060 gets hot running Halo
[7:36:55] Shezzmou: about time to ban that again eh?
[7:36:56] Alegnowar: lost ark is gonna be a good test to see how popular can a mix of ARPG/MMO could be on thr west, D4 team could take a peek at that
[7:37:04] firekingkyle: Im okay with the Pay-To-Win cause its an MMO, it wont make you good at your toon or end game content. Just takes away the hard work that makes that all feel good.
[7:37:06] Sypline_: At release it was more P2W, but over the last few years they have slowly made P2W less and less beneficial
[7:37:09] Aidler: but to be fair. people in asia like “pay to win”
[7:37:12] Broomba: no every pc i buy or custom built, becomes outdated in 2-3 years
[7:37:16] Heero_Effect: KappaClaus
[7:37:24] BoiAtomico: these MFrs hyped for Feb launchers, while I'm here waiting for the 28th of Jan to get the new Pokemon game and hope it's not a shit show
[7:37:30] a23pk: "Banned" ezzzzzz
[7:37:31] at1c: Köpa för att vinna :D
[7:37:32] Dyriks: dodged a bullet early monkaS
[7:37:34] pacificmc1: P4Y T0 W1N PogChamp
[7:37:36] JaseLeland: the p2w people were so annoying during the beta
[7:37:41] happybooger: ill ask in the 10th language LUL
[7:37:44] Malfleur: I hope so, then I can stay here and watch you non stop. West is just to touchy
[7:37:44] crazy1god: П2В
[7:37:56] Eraste: im hyped for lost ark and not playing elden ring so nothing else to worry about
[7:37:56] pacificmc1: PAY T@ W!N

[7:38:00] Mecabeast: what's been grinding my gears is been trying to get a series x but can't find one without paying for 200-300 extra in stuff I don't want or need
[7:38:08] crazy1god: Elyon ?
[7:38:20] CaptainJoeyNY: Tera was an AWESOME game when it launched
[7:38:22] Aidler: understandable to ban the term p2w
[7:38:22] kompot06: when will your boyfriend stream?
[7:38:24] futomara01: it looks  nothing  like  tera ???
[7:38:25] Syprus1: pei tu ngyen

[7:38:41] Nehcrom: Do the campaign.
[7:38:50] Alegnowar: talk to bolvar and skip
[7:38:50] CrossThread: mussotowelliee
[7:38:53] Shezzmou: Talk to bolvar and skip the intro
[7:38:57] Nehcrom: You will unlock Korthia through the campaign doesnt take long.
[7:39:09] shabobado: Bolvar
[7:39:11] BarleyBearr: I think if you complete that Heart of the Forest quest, you'll get another quest to go back to Bolvar and you can skip then
[7:39:13] Draugrs: Go to Bolvar in Oribos to do unlock skip
[7:39:17] Twobyfours: contingent on payment to win?
[7:39:18] Malfleur: And even this video they don#t actually watch
[7:39:21] Alegnowar: bolvar skip u all
