[1:20:59] 91Niki: I'll say one thing. I don't care how much something in a video game upsets you. DDOSing servers is just straight up stupidity. DDOSing isn't gonna solve anything. Now you're just ruining a fun time for those who is actively playing
[1:21:04] kokochris: I decided to sit this one out myself.
[1:21:04] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[1:21:09] emznev: they doing it because they don't want everyone sitting in dalaran spamming dungeons kekw
[1:21:20] emznev: not
[1:21:23] shadowghostytv: niki thats why they are doing it, to annoy other and laugh about it
[1:21:34] abracka_: as long as they don't wait until p2 or p3 to add it
[1:21:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: but they dont want everyone sitting in dalaran spamming pvp kekw
[1:21:54] 91Niki: @shyshuki People think DDOSing will result in change, or more people asking for change. It won't.
[1:22:13] GamingDad77: If they wanted everyone to travel to dungeons..why did they even put summoning stones be the entrances anyway?
[1:22:18] tigerbaww: stupid question, but what's the plugin that lets you move your hp bar and opponents hp bar to where you have yours?
[1:22:20] Adraythien: they also want the new AH SeriousSloth

[1:22:39] NILLme: trying to reinvent the wheel again
[1:22:48] Tiamarilien: I would be leveling much more in Wrath Classic if you could queue for random dungeons.
[1:22:58] theoriginalzinng: i feel like there is one coming for DF yeah
[1:23:06] VirenTV: I think it's the new talent system, I think it's going to be problematic
[1:23:15] KronasKG: I thinkl Classic was made for private server people and they are cattering to that comunity.... as a retailor if we dont like classic we will play classic
[1:23:22] Lostdogal: I'm rubbish at pvp, can I still get Honor for brutal gear from completely failing at it or should that just be a hard pass?
[1:23:27] Trawkey: They implemented pvp que from anywhere today
[1:23:40] tigerbaww: @tigerbaww thank you
[1:23:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: more talking happens in a pvp match then any dungeon group
[1:23:52] lmtheboogie: blizzard needs to stop thinking about convenience. classic is not about convenience, retail is
[1:23:57] Velashen: Interaction.. aka arguing. That all people do now lol.
[1:24:15] FryeTV: they day after i maxxed my mining giving up time on AV grind they do the que anywhere
[1:24:15] niftyzauper: just tuned in, are we talking about how dumb it is that they put que from anywhere bgs but they won't put the dungeon finder in?
[1:24:18] FryeTV: sadge but also happy for alts
[1:24:18] abe4th: whats the new button to toggle the pvp menu? I thought it used to be H?
[1:24:29] GamingDad77: @niftyzauper yes
[1:24:30] SGT_BAMF: i've leveled all my classic characters to 70 (3 so far) with 0 dungeons done - and thats just to save the headache of not having RDF
[1:24:44] Breakernaut: There's people who still think classic is about being the super old school experience instead of playing old content with semi-modern conviences
[1:24:53] TheUnknowing: yeah it honestly just seems silly to allow pvp to be queues any where but no rdf
[1:25:02] Molvonos: @lmtheboogie lol, it entertains me how some of ya'll either didnt properly play back in vanilla or don't remember why 'convenience' was implemented.   People wanted it because they got tired of wasting time.
[1:25:14] Verrekk: I still say they should have released RDF for vanilla/tbc dungeons
[1:25:20] 91Niki: The Classics team logic with this is like them being anti milk, cuz free the cows reeee, but on the side eating milk chocolate. Make it make sense LUL
[1:25:43] Verrekk: at least until ICC comes out
[1:25:44] alucardais: i kind of liked in cata how you had to discover the entrance before you could Q for each instance
[1:25:56] Mecabeast: sp3aking of pvp how does open world wintergrasp work for voa instances

[1:27:44] generaljosh721: They should just have quests that introduce the raid so people understand the story and see the landscape/entrance before allowing queues for that dungeon/raid

[1:47:26] iiTornTunaii: Scaling your teeth hurts
[1:47:41] martzerarh: @ThatGuyFayde hence the discounted comment.
[1:47:47] itscityboy: WutFace
[1:47:54] Ertra: they'll likely need to numb you up
[1:47:55] fewyn: i went to the dentist for the first time in 20 years earlier this year
[1:47:55] Tamianth: ive been without teeth for over 10 years now, cant afford to buy a set :(
[1:47:58] fewyn: it was terrible
[1:48:01] AllenzoTV: i had one after years, and i was fine, it felt good honestly
[1:48:02] raldrik: just suck on an edible
[1:48:03] cabalish: weed wont help much
[1:48:05] Nazz_1138: @Towelliee just got the freezing bug, was after a stun
[1:48:06] ThatGuyFayde: @martzerarh wrong again you pay full price
[1:48:08] cigarette_butter: just eat an edible you'll be good
[1:48:12] generaljosh721: I would want to be knocked out fuck that
[1:48:22] PigPenLen: No for teeth go get some coke!
[1:48:24] Nazz_1138: yup
[1:48:28] Mecabeast: I felt bad for my previous roommate he had an allergy to novacaine so wasn't the greatest when he needed a root canal
[1:48:30] martzerarh: @ThatGuyFayde righto.
[1:48:35] AllenzoTV: just make sure to piss before u sit down. nothing worse than asking to go pee during dentist
[1:49:03] aloofjely: wrath coming back makes me tempted to play again
[1:49:05] PigPenLen: Coke on the gums and ya feel like Mr Ed!
[1:49:24] LawnSpeaker: Do people not get regular teeth cleaning done in the US?
[1:49:44] Breakernaut: @LawnSpeaker we can't even go to the doctor regularly
[1:49:45] zytaxlol: once a decade? I go once a year lol
[1:49:46] GamingDad77: @LawnSpeaker depends on their insurance...and if they even have it
[1:49:46] jerexify: @LawnSpeaker LOL No. It's expensive.
[1:49:52] 91Niki: @LawnSpeaker They can, but with how much they charge, I don't blame them for skipping LUL
[1:50:00] AllenzoTV: some insurance companies give 1 or 2 free obnes a year
[1:50:02] zytaxlol: So do i
[1:50:04] cigarette_butter: @LawnSpeaker most people dont have dental care at all because even if you have insurance, major procedures are not covered
[1:50:05] LawnSpeaker: Even for a routine checkup and cleaning?
[1:50:07] PastelByeol: Too expensive and most broke ppl insurances dont cover haha
[1:50:24] generaljosh721: "that'll be $4000. We gotta pay for this new machine."
[1:50:25] Mecabeast: @lawnspeaker depends on if people elect for dental coverage at work when I was younger I'd go every 6mos till college
[1:50:28] AllenzoTV: a cleaning is like 200 bucks
[1:50:42] cigarette_butter: @LawnSpeaker a routine cleaning without insurance is $100-$200
[1:51:02] Breakernaut: " i know a guy"
[1:51:04] LawnSpeaker: Huh‚Ä¶ $100-$200 seems worth it to me
[1:51:09] Zolare: theres always a guy! lol
[1:51:09] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[1:51:11] AllenzoTV: yeah it is
[1:51:14] GamingDad77: " Dis guy!"
[1:51:19] cigarette_butter: I mean when you live check to check 200 is not trivial
[1:51:21] generaljosh721: Definitely evading taxes lol
[1:51:23] fewyn: LUL
[1:51:25] stallowned: lol
[1:51:36] Breakernaut: @LawnSpeaker Until you are working minimum wage for 7.25 making 300 a week
[1:51:36] jerexify: @LawnSpeaker When you're already choosing whether to pay a bill or buy food, $100 to $200 is not an easy amount of money to give up.
[1:51:37] PastelByeol: Too expensive for broke ppl lol üòÇ
[1:51:49] zytaxlol: I'm having one removed in 2 weeks, gonna be 3k danish roughly 400$
[1:51:53] Noshpan: I need to have all of my teeth removed, but my insurance refuses to cover the anesthesia. So I have to pray that I don't choke on my teeth when they fall out. No dentist will work on my teeth in the mean time because I'm at too great a risk for sepsis
[1:51:55] bogv: did he had a license ?
[1:51:57] Teknofear64: My Mom used to take us to the Vo. Tech school!
[1:52:02] Zolare: when he removed it did he say Boda Bing Boda Boom! lol
[1:52:02] Broomba: Mafia Dentist!
[1:52:06] milleeagle: You could move to Sweden ;) it would be free there aswell ;)
[1:52:27] 91Niki: Yeah dentist in Denmark also isn't covered by health care. It's so dumb
[1:52:34] generaljosh721: An old dentist or mine fled the country and moved to Canada because the IRS came after him. Super awkward when I showed up and the building was empty
[1:52:36] cigarette_butter: Yeah that's actually a great tip. If you're broke and want a cleaning you can often wait for a community college to have training days or whatever. You often only have to pay for supplies ($10)
[1:52:36] DoughBoi_Trev: CUBA!!!!
[1:52:38] AllenzoTV: i got my cat fixes for free by vet students :D
[1:52:41] jeflag: license to drill
[1:52:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna guess no on that one
[1:52:48] the_bad_goat: nowadays it's, I learned how to do this on tiktok
[1:53:19] Breakernaut: @the_bad_goat Yeah, can charge your phone in the microwave LUL
[1:53:26] Rudric_Ice: Kreygasm
[1:53:48] LawnSpeaker: @jerexify obviously, but I‚Äôm talking about in general
[1:53:55] Deku_Scrub0: never had a cavity in my life. brush my teeth like once a week. i drink as much cola as asmongold
[1:54:06] Feydens: was this in Florida?
[1:54:07] TweektheProphet: that reminds me of going back to school shopping with my folks, you would walk into a convince store then knock on the back door and dude would open the door talk to you for awhile then let you in
[1:54:10] jerexify: @LawnSpeaker That is in general for a vast majority of the US now, unfortunately.
[1:54:11] geokouts: insurance?
[1:54:20] cigarette_butter: @Towelliee you had a barber experience with a dentist

[2:04:57] EKS90_: @Towelliee We‚Äôve decided to remove Skull Banner, the general consensus across sources of feedback has not been particularly positive and we‚Äôve struggled to find the right home for Skull Banner in each of the talent trees. Therefore, we‚Äôve decided to remove it.  This was the reasoning.
[2:05:03] veroggo99: i noticed...all night,horde was not doing to well i was fk!!... XD

[4:26:24] cryft: 50% exp buff is a testament to that LUL
[4:26:28] zorantt: Not so much the leveling experience. It'll be more gearing up your toons
[4:26:36] WallyJustice: Classic was no joke
[4:26:38] pent217: You can have like 3 characters at max in the first 2 days, no WAY I want extra weeks of no content before raids open.
[4:26:54] onybear: I haven‚Äôt requested my time off yet, but my boss is well aware that it is coming‚Ä¶I am just waiting for an announcement
[4:26:57] Warcraft_Whims: If they keep a similar XP in beta when it goes live it'll take about 6-8 hours to go from 60-70

[4:28:22] zorantt: Would that mean that pre patch won't be Oct 25th then? Will it be a week before? (If the release date is moved up)
