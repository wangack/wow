[4:48:29] jussttdee: YEP
[4:48:32] Slajso: I mean...compared to US portions, most seem...small? No?
[4:49:00] Auxidize: do you pay the same amount though as like us portions?
[4:49:01] SVPV: US portions are ridiculous though, its silly to compare
[4:49:06] myst3001: nah a lot of places I went had huge portions
[4:49:15] MZAexcessive: well idk I would just plainly disagree. There's nothing that correlates to extended life. Maybe quality of life...
[4:50:05] kipley: max km is like 35k isnt it LUL
[4:50:12] kipley: then they export the cars/scrap em
[4:50:13] GiantDuckKing: Surprise surprise
[4:50:34] jussttdee: monkaHmm
[4:50:53] kipley: weak drugs? LUL
[4:51:04] kipley: how about no drugs
[4:51:05] GiantDuckKing: Escalators man. USA has some learning to do
[4:51:44] jussttdee: LUL yoinked
[4:51:51] myst3001: thats just cus avg person size is smaller
[4:51:59] Shotzmann: are any of these real reasons not to move to japan..?
[4:52:18] MZAexcessive: it's suspect to think about anything related to one person, when the vast majority remain diverse. Whether poor or rich. Happiness isn't a youtube video LUL
[4:52:20] kipley: ye #9 if you legit take 6 ibuprofen a day LUL
[4:52:24] TrueDrag0n: is that true?
[4:52:55] MZAexcessive: I liked this video LUL
[4:52:57] myst3001: not the Japanese game releases LUL
[4:52:59] Starwinpikachu: it takes forever for shipment to arrive overseas?
[4:53:01] kipley: big ass
[4:53:05] Shotzmann: lol
[4:53:05] GiantDuckKing: I think the biggest issues someone would face are a language barrier, a lot of rules in daily life (trash days), and racism especially in finding homes.
[4:53:12] akaleara: small meals and small clothes? D: count me out!!!
[4:53:20] seba0729: Anyways uhm... I bought a whole bunch of shungite, rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is. No, no Suge Knight, I think hes locked up in prison. Talking shungite. Anyways, its a 2 billion year old like rock, stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. So thats my story. I bought a whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la casa. Little pyramids. Stuff like that.
[4:53:40] gritz_n_pitz: SHUNGITE
[4:53:41] Hoaxidious: Waaah, i havent seen the avengers yet.. Im leaving Japan
[4:53:42] myst3001: can't live in a country that doesn't have the next fast and furious movie on time
[4:53:43] kipley: chris abroad has a video exactly like paolos, they are both shit. idk why they even make those videos. fearmongering, and they never mention pros
[4:53:44] MZAexcessive: it sucked but it was insightful. I've never even thought about mover there LUL
[4:53:45] jussttdee: SHUNGITE
[4:53:47] TrueDrag0n: SHUNGITE
[4:53:51] jussttdee: YEP
[4:53:54] bigoldoinx: @NightWaddie  HahaShrugMiddle
[4:53:55] kipley: yeah
[4:53:58] lovelyzsj: YEP
[4:54:12] kipley: it was better and more realistic but it was still sort of fearmongering
[4:54:28] kipley: xenophobia is a real one for sure
[4:54:32] bigoldoinx: I would only go to japan cause of anime
[4:54:35] kipley: which i think chris mentioned?
[4:54:53] kipley: ye but that's not a reason not to move there imo lol
[4:55:29] myst3001: its a bit more real when trying to climb up the corporate world though
[4:55:30] bigoldoinx: jake and bake lol
[4:55:31] kipley: no bullshit culture
[4:55:41] MZAexcessive: I had a Japanese lab partner in college. One of the few friends I still have.
[4:55:47] GiantDuckKing: To a degree I agree with that Jake, but having Kids in Japan is also really tough if you're foreign. Unless you really know Japanese, you're gonna struggle with your local teachers and parents.
[4:55:52] jussttdee: monkaHmm
[4:55:56] kipley: RUDE?
[4:56:01] kipley: doubled down on his title LUL

[5:00:29] GiantDuckKing: @Leukine They gotta get vaccinations under control, then they'll probably open up under tourism pressure. Right now not even tourism folks want it because it's kinda fucked atm.
[5:00:52] kipley: orc rogue tho is goofy as fuck
