[0:42:41] Collected1: i get behind whoever is getting the kills because i admire the execution more than the guilds themselves. and there was some incredible execution this race.

[0:46:42] Collected1: neither side was
[0:46:50] KragnosWoW: but i did hear they nerfed fury warrior during the race and thats a Sadge they should revert that now

[0:47:11] cinnamints: @shu7upmom Trill also having Arena World Championships was a big, big problem. And then Scott had to fly home a few days ago.
[0:47:18] shu7upmom: Well ECHO is always ready for long runs

[0:49:12] i_cassius: Echo didnt loose players ...but to be fair if your a pro esports team you should be ready for that sort of thing...Especialy as the race has no time frame
[0:49:42] ijuki: Expecation vs reality ... that's all I say
[0:49:43] captiv8: yep, and i feel like people are blaming blizzard
[0:49:47] captiv8: which is stupid
[0:50:02] Dagomarus: the difference in my opinion was progress, both guilds weren't prepared for the length of the raid, but the additional stress of being behind was the game changer imo
[0:50:18] ahies28: Echo just better this teir
[0:50:24] Collected1: I don't think it's stupid at all. they know the guilds hold in person events. a 17 day progression is a big issue for that.
[0:50:44] captiv8: right but blizzard doesn't tell them to do that
[0:50:47] captiv8: not their fault
[0:51:00] ShadoodHD: especially when players have other jobs outside wow
[0:51:09] Gingerprimer: TBF to the guilds almost all raids have been the 1 week+ a few days  extra so it is not werid for them to expect that
[0:51:52] Collected1: captiv8: but they know it happens and benefit from it happening so they should at least acknowledge it wasn't ideal or start to inform guilds ahead of time that the race is going to be longer

[0:52:05] cinnamints: @davey_wavey06 It's a bit of an irresolvable issue b/c there isn't another Trill. It's not as simple as saying "recruit more of those so the guild has backups" b/c there just aren't any equivalent players.
[0:52:18] KragnosWoW: its only game why have to be mad
[0:52:22] captiv8: @davey_wavey06 exactly
[0:53:03] ijuki: @Collected1 Blizzard has 0 obligation to say anything about difficulty nor should they say anything, this race is community based and should stay there too
[0:53:10] Dagomarus: i enjoyed watching multiple bosses being difficult, you dont want a easy raid for RWF, i think the guilds should limit themselves to less hours of raiding and have longer breaks and sleep in more
[0:53:13] Collected1: whatever
[0:53:31] Collected1: i'm done trying to argue the point
[0:53:32] propoopimus: im a super for a large construction company i wish i could spend 16 hours a day playing a game KEKW

[0:56:57] swervity82: was there a secret phase?
[0:56:59] KragnosWoW: is it normal for only 2 people to get the mythic mount?
[0:57:02] Gingerprimer: Yeah this was like the reverse Nyalotha were Method were so far off
[0:57:03] jure__: and loved Gingi joining the commentary, his energy was amazing
[0:57:07] Thoreya: echo was hungry af. they wanted that shit

[0:59:19] Dagomarus: yeah both Liquid and Echo are both great when they are ahead
[0:59:25] jure__: it's the prep man, the progress they probably enjoyed, but the prep just took too much out of them before they even started mythic prog
[0:59:56] Demanisraar: True
[1:00:10] ahies28: yea made is closer to a month of being away
[1:00:17] Dagomarus: 183 splits
[1:00:19] anamroth: yea
[1:00:25] nezz231: echo did 180+
[1:00:25] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[1:00:26] Senthius09: going for heroic week was a good idea if the raid lasted as long as SoD or Nathria
[1:00:29] EppatTV: how do you think they could do less splits?
[1:00:41] Demanisraar: Echo where just in beast mode... insane group of players
[1:01:14] Gingerprimer: Yeah the past races I have been watching every second but this race I was burned out during Anduin
[1:01:16] Dagomarus: they had pretty much all 40 players on their roster ready to jump in at any time
[1:01:26] lithium364: heresy i say
[1:01:30] mar1ey: master loot. solved.
[1:01:33] Kisswani: I felt Echo went to another level after Anduin . was insane to watch
[1:01:36] captiv8: but they don't...
[1:01:38] i_cassius: Echo wanted to have alot of classes available for each comp
[1:01:41] ijuki: @mar1ey Won't help
[1:01:42] Demanisraar: yeah the way to get gear should be revised.. been so for years
[1:01:46] KinggKebab: If it was a proper patch cycle in any other expansion, It would've been fine, cause this raid would've ended at Anduin and the Jailer would've been the .3 raid

[1:02:24] sklingel: I think most of the player base doesnt give a shit about RWF
[1:02:38] EppatTV: Big true!
[1:02:41] Ezekyler: also in this tier was not tested, RWF went blind for last bosses KEKW
[1:02:44] Wrizzik: wow. 7 ads for ad break. D:
[1:02:44] Gotxiko: big nerfs in 1-2 weeks for muthic as usual
[1:02:44] ShadoodHD: @Towelliee did you see the cost of the race for liquid?
[1:02:44] Gingerprimer: Yeah we are totaly not getting tons of nerfs now to the bosses  :)
[1:02:57] Demanisraar: The comments that got me the most where the ones blaming blizzard for Liquid throwing in the towel... I mean what?

[1:03:35] EppatTV: also the three non tested bosses were real good
[1:03:37] realnzall: @Towelliee Hello there
[1:03:41] ijuki: The last bosses was quite good designed, tuning ... I dunno, I haven't done them myself
[1:03:46] OvenMonkeyGaming: shouldnt bugs and whatnot be fixed by devvs before a release
[1:03:49] captiv8: yeah they are basically game testers for blizz and blizz doesn't have to pay them
[1:03:49] Dagomarus: theres 3 levels of mythic raid difficulty, Broken first release, RWF nerfs, post RWF nerfs
[1:03:50] lilwird_o7: Geebus 11 ads :(
[1:03:56] Ezekyler: that Defile that happened and disappeared magically before the kill pull KEKW
[1:03:58] squirellplays: Hopefully liquid bounce back next tier :( the decision to travel before heroic week even started fucked them hard. Echo travelled at the end of heroic week and 50% of guild was raiding from home @towelliee
[1:04:02] d2darkalliance: @towelliee they nerf bosses around the world first race. I wish they leave it insane hard and agree they should do somethings about the shortened time with splits
[1:04:09] Gingerprimer: Scott soloing Anduin in the end was the highlight for me
[1:04:12] ShadoodHD: i would like the devs to do their own testing like ff14 devs do before release
[1:04:24] Dagomarus: rygelon dps check will be gutted too
[1:04:26] dracullatv: Since its last tier and Jailer is dropping almost no loot needed anyway (its last boss of the last tier) I would be happy they will not touch Jailer Mythic at all (nerf others) and see how many guilds will get Cutting Edge this tier KEKW
[1:04:27] Kisswani: @EppatTV yeah it was relatively smooth the whole raid . some comments on twitter calling it " buggy " really made my blood boil
[1:04:28] fistofnature: no nerf only true gamers allowed EZ
[1:04:28] ShadoodHD: and at lease beat it LUL
[1:04:31] liden86: @Ezekyler they de-spawn after 60 seconds, whats your point?
[1:04:33] flebbooo: Halondrus about to get that painsmith treatment KEKW
[1:05:33] Dagomarus: Halondrus added like 4 days just himself

[1:05:40] Gingerprimer: 10 days is the sweet spot for me ngl
[1:05:46] Twyzted_f8: They probably caught that bug that didn’t happen each time where the floor didn’t open back up with phase 4.  Able to go and trace down that random occurrence
[1:05:52] Kisswani: yeah 8-12 days
[1:06:16] captiv8: maybe the RWF guilds should go on strike and see if that fixes something
[1:06:27] ShadoodHD: they need to have their own internal testing if they want to make it better, no outside interference, nothing
[1:06:29] Anexros: 7-10 days is a nice sweet spot imo
[1:07:00] Gingerprimer: Thursayd Friday is my fav
[1:07:02] Dagomarus: you can tell when its overtuned when its literally top two guilds in the world and then a massive gap between them 2 and the 3rd best in terms of progress
[1:07:19] d2darkalliance: They should bring back lockout imo
[1:07:21] Gingerprimer: Yeah and nobody expected the Crab the be 300+ boss
[1:07:35] i_cassius: they expected 14 days coz they wouldnt have killed jailer without double leggo
[1:07:38] Wcvechten: Halondrus really was the big outlier
[1:07:40] pixxelina: Has Ion made a post about Echo yet?
[1:07:42] MarquisLek: hold on to your butts
[1:07:45] Wrizzik: isn't that expected at this point, since it's the last raid of expansion?
[1:07:53] ahies28: a month of focus on wow is priceless for blizzard @towelliee
[1:08:02] Anexros: mentally every top guild must be exhausted, feel for these guys and girls that are doing it 16 hours a day for 18 days straight
[1:08:05] angryhonkinggoose: Haha i would definitely ask for a few million dollars if i knew that they depended on me to fix the raid

[1:08:28] EppatTV: Gambit is cracked, love that key
[1:08:33] t0csik: when you think back 18 days is short .. if we take into consideration that some raids were up for months in the beggining ... now we want evrething to be short
[1:08:37] realnzall: @Towelliee Do you think Sepulcher was a good ending to Shadowlands with regards to raid quality?
[1:09:07] Dagomarus: yeah they did it the right way, giving up day raiding and just doing normal hours

[1:10:52] Wrizzik: @Towelliee isn't last raid of an expac always going to take longer to get through?
[1:10:53] ijuki: If they are going to communicate, they should communicate to ALL guilds... not just the top 5

[1:11:38] cinnamints: If/when the ABK acquisition happens, I believe a few of the current generation of RWF raiders will be hired to work on raid testing & tuning.
[1:11:39] Gingerprimer: Yeah and it is totaly a suprise when after the race all the bosses takes massive nerfs
[1:11:50] t0csik: i dident say they were harder ... but know 50% of the fight is know even before the fight starts
[1:11:58] tydrennistv: I will say, team liquid needs to get the raiders their own chef. Eating Jersey Mike’s an pizza every day. Echo was eating healthy meals everyday you can go that long on just junk food
[1:12:01] ahies28: @towelliee blizzard just got 3 weeks of focus on wow with rwf which is priceless for them

[1:12:15] AureliusXV: but on the real you dont hear nascar and football players bitching and moaning about the sport they love
[1:12:21] signeddudu: Thoughts on your buddy Lore quitting blizz? Do you know his next gig?
[1:12:24] Gingerprimer: Or at least not raiding at this level
[1:12:26] AureliusXV: no do you
[1:12:33] Dagomarus: i think echos rogerbrown will probably become a raid leader / analyst full time after this
[1:12:35] Shatraugh: I feel drained just from watching the race all day every day... can only imagine the stress level of the players LUL
[1:12:44] NoWaayMan: boston has good food
[1:12:55] zerkx1: when you make your living playing a video game professionally you can't just "not play" the game as you're literally quitting your job with 0 fall back one. so often e-sports players end up either going back to college as a fallback. Infact I met a few starcraft pros that went to my college and tell me this straight to my face. that's why I never went into the e-sports thing seriously
[1:13:04] snickletoe: speaking of food, my first Factor meals show up tuesday....
[1:13:13] Senthius09: gingi should be a caster, his hype on the kill was hilarious and awesome
[1:13:15] nezz231: scripe want him to but I think roger wanna play tbh
[1:13:29] ne0rmatrix: good morning!
[1:13:35] zerkx1: also sorry for the paragraph andy moment

[1:14:27] pereadin: :O my sub dropped BabyRage, gotta fix that on the first, forgot to update my card info lol
[1:14:36] Gingerprimer: @zerkx1 yeah unless you are top top tier player in any of LOL leagues esports is a big gamble
[1:14:37] 1s2real: Pala double Leggo with 4 piece is unkillable
[1:14:44] fistofnature: final stand is just too good of a "use incase fuckup"
[1:15:05] KragnosWoW: i should prob do LFR on my main so i can try to get tier
[1:15:10] sLogOG: @zerkx1 the oppurtunities are growing lately, esports players have streaming, casting etc.
[1:15:11] Laluzmia: Laluzmia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:15:13] AureliusXV: changes like what?
[1:15:26] Dagomarus: i doubt we will have a 11 boss raid again
[1:15:28] Docura95: what are the best tanks to get all +15 with pugs?
[1:15:30] KragnosWoW: league players for sure need that
[1:15:33] pereadin: After this race I think they'll make tiers closer to the 10 day standard
[1:15:43] 1s2real: This race was actually crazy .
[1:15:44] pereadin: standard as in what we've been used to the past few tiers
[1:16:03] AureliusXV: so let wow make the raid easier then we get to hear that the raid was to easy. WOWdevs cant win
[1:16:06] Collected1: the Liquid kill where a DK solo'ed the end was an epic moment
[1:16:17] Fireman17: It slowly becomes a job
[1:16:17] captiv8: sounds healthy
[1:16:23] Varchon: so why were there no hunters on the jailer kill?  underperforming?
[1:16:25] AureliusXV: this shit irritates the fuck out of me
[1:16:26] KragnosWoW: the anduin kill was the true world first race
[1:16:31] snickletoe: they just needed some warning so they could at least try to properly prepare
[1:16:32] Dagomarus: i know Gingi and Roger were going around helping talking to their guys between pulls, especially before anduin they were struggling mentally
[1:16:33] cinnamints: Max talked to an esports psychologist a while back on stream. Was very interesting.
[1:16:48] 1s2real: naw but I think you can break up the race in pieces . Maybe not everyday .
[1:16:49] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[1:17:03] o00o0o0oo: "little league teams"
[1:17:10] Laluzmia: Liquid did not look the same team of last year and before I think the race got to some of them what do you think
[1:17:12] Gingerprimer: And also being on camera for 16 hours a day is insane
[1:17:14] Shrenko: monkaS
[1:17:17] Collected1: i have this image of gingi giving out massages... i know... shame. shame.
[1:17:27] AureliusXV: KEKEW
[1:17:27] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[1:17:28] 1s2real: I love how you stay true to wow.  Not just playing the flavor of the month
[1:17:30] AureliusXV: KEKW
[1:17:30] fewyn: the mistake was going to B O S T O N
[1:17:45] captiv8: blizzard could put a time limit each day on how long mythic raiding is open.  That would fix everything since this is all about the 1 percent of WoW players right?
[1:17:47] TirnanCP: Lol. I had no idea they were here. Yeah, probably a mistake.
[1:17:55] FleuryGG: the lighting on the analyst desk was atrocious
[1:18:04] tydrennistv: They should have the twitch stream psychologist do a post raid session with the players.
[1:18:09] AureliusXV: think liquid is regretting picking them up
[1:18:12] AureliusXV: ?
[1:18:13] Collected1: captiv8 : my idea is lock the instance on Tues & Weds to fix the global issue
[1:18:17] fcwar_: Ghetto? Choose your words wisely Towelliee - this the home of the Patriots BabyRage
[1:18:27] Thogeda: ELX effect :D
[1:18:31] captiv8: @Collected1 that sounds good
[1:18:32] rambaldi00: well Echo never hit a hard wall. Liquid did. Anyone would get fried when stuck at a wall
[1:18:35] Shrenko: its the food
[1:18:37] Varchon: Blizzard tried to time limit a boss once, algylon or something like that.  it was 1 hour a week I think
[1:18:39] KragnosWoW: NA in general for esports dont have an amazing track record
[1:18:43] Laluzmia: lol
[1:18:44] zerkx1: Honestly I think Liquid should focus on other games.
[1:18:44] Wcvechten: best part were the morning segments with preheat and lula tho
[1:18:47] Nevindaz: ELX Gingi Juice gachiBASS
[1:18:48] Armdel: Echo probably got a lot of energy at the end there seeing the boss get lower and lower while Liquid were stuck
[1:18:50] Nevindaz: KEKW
[1:18:55] fcwar_: LUL
[1:18:57] 1s2real: Fuck The patriots . A bunch of cheaters
[1:18:58] Friiz_The_Gamer: Colts and Matt Ryan...Eh?
[1:18:58] akia03: one nice thing about this long raid was china got to show what they can do
[1:18:59] fewyn: I hope the patriots suck and don't make a playoff game for twenty years
[1:19:16] TirnanCP: The worst part about Boston sports is Boston sports fans...
[1:19:17] giggz91: its ok to be mad colts never get anywer in the season lol pad in the back @Towelliee
[1:19:23] Bertinelle: my dolphins looking real good for next year
[1:19:32] Xsilentghost: dragon expansion annoument in 23 days pog
[1:19:40] fewyn: phins up @Bertinelle
[1:19:41] Syprus1: poor guys had to go to boston ouch
[1:19:41] AureliusXV: dolphins KEKW
[1:19:45] Djfarmville: 1
[1:19:45] tydrennistv: I think scripe and max both aged 10 years during this race.
[1:19:56] Gingerprimer: The boost Echo got from the Anduin nerfs mid were pretty big ngl
[1:19:59] Senthius09: turns out he was playing with half a leg all game
[1:20:04] mooeees: How does one even get into these kind of guilds
[1:20:06] dSaipher: We call that the Baker Mayfield cop-out lol
[1:20:12] Collected1: scripe had no idea if it was 11am or pm last night
[1:20:14] 1s2real: Dolphins 🐬 baby !!
[1:20:17] Gingerprimer: @Tydrennis yeah max said he always losses a ton of weight during the race
[1:20:18] KragnosWoW: Most UFC fighters are injured on fight day
[1:20:30] zerkx1: well anyone that watched max before the race would kinda know that their heart really isn't in WoW anymore.
[1:20:32] Dagomarus: yeah echo were struggling till anduin, then they had a meeting mid anduin to discuss their mentality, and they changed from catching up mentality to lets blast this
[1:20:32] Senthius09: baker got done dirty by the browns, but the browns is the browns
[1:20:44] sintax_24: To me it looked like Echo was always ready to try a new strat where liquid was way too bull headed and would smash their face against a wall for days
[1:20:44] pereadin: KEKW
[1:20:53] AureliusXV: @KragnosWoW and they suck it up and do their job
[1:20:53] cibsii_: Oh echo won race.. meh
[1:21:03] flebbooo: Poor Wagnawos
[1:21:11] giggz91: @Towelliee what was that max said he wasnt going to be the face anymore before he ended his stream?
[1:21:17] 1s2real: Lmao . There some good players on rag I can’t lie
[1:21:18] reggiepowa: give him a chance ;(
[1:21:19] akia03: any pve survival hunters in chat?
[1:21:41] tydrennistv: I will say this race gave so much hype to wow I loved it 100k+ viewers 24/7 for the last 30 days
[1:21:45] minael1: what do you expect next xpac to be? light vs void?
[1:21:55] AureliusXV: and tell them that you quit
[1:21:55] sintax_24: They need to replace max, I dont think he has it anymore
[1:22:04] tydrennistv: Do you think max steps down and becomes a manager for them
[1:22:06] 1s2real: Max isn’t the problem
[1:22:06] AureliusXV: you failed team liquid
[1:22:16] vyranoth: Hey Towelliee! Thoughts on this tier? I think this tier is amazing, and hope for more tiers like this in terms of lenght and fight designs!
[1:22:37] 1s2real: I agree with that . I spotted in and watch
[1:22:41] Syprus1: SL's has left a bad taste in alot of popls mouths
[1:22:45] zerkx1: more people were watching Asmongold then RWF
[1:22:49] Yayamandua: is it because the race too long?
[1:22:51] rambaldi00: makes sense. WoW is at a population low point
[1:22:56] giggz91: of liquid
[1:23:01] Fireman17: Could handing leadership over maybe?
[1:23:03] Yayamandua: so people lose interest until just before the kill?
[1:23:05] fcwar_: Liquid Org took a chance on this, I honestly don't see it as a success this time around. And yeah I agree, viewers down compared to past
[1:23:06] chubahi: @zerkx1  thats not true tho
[1:23:06] 1s2real: Shadowlands had everything going for it .
[1:23:18] 1s2real: I’m so excited for 10.0 and hopefully the rebirth of wow
[1:23:22] dracullus: rwf popularity is correlated with patch popularity, which is lower than usual
[1:23:25] tydrennistv: I feel like he’s going to be come just the team manager less then the raid leader and shot caller
[1:23:29] Thoreya: hot take: liquid wont win a race in 10.0
[1:23:31] spthugstv: @zerkx1 yestarday alot of ppl watch echo steam
[1:23:32] Syprus1: @rsanc155 me too
[1:23:33] pixxelina: LMAO
[1:23:35] Sicknessqt: ashes KEKW
[1:23:39] TLew02: I was hype for the first week of RWF, then it extended well into week 2… lol
[1:23:41] Collected1: 20-star-citizen lol
[1:23:44] ItsBorland: My grandkids will be able to play ashes if they are lucky
[1:23:46] vyranoth: I really wish FFXIV would step up their raiding things! would love to see an actual RWF
[1:23:47] KragnosWoW: riot mmo COPIUM
[1:23:48] Armdel: maybe he will embrace his role at Liquid more and step down from the wow side of things
[1:23:52] cinnamints: Didn't hear Max saying he wasn't going to be the face going forward. I heard him say it was one of the things he needed a break from after doing it for weeks non-stop.
[1:23:54] Dagomarus: Well max's stream gets more viewers than the liquid channel because hes the face of it
[1:23:55] chubahi: over 130k watched echo sport so alot more ppl watchin it than asmon :D
[1:23:58] Shrenko: PETPET towOny
[1:24:02] sLogOG: @zerkx1 echo hit 140k+ yesterday
[1:24:04] fcwar_: Does Liquid have 2 leaders? Echo can interchange between Scripe or Potter.
[1:24:11] vyranoth: @lallest it even reached 220k at one point
[1:24:15] 1s2real: Max is a pillar of wow .
[1:24:31] mooeees: Tbh raid caller should motivate just as much as shot call or assign that to someone
[1:24:33] chubahi: nice to hear !
[1:24:43] 1s2real: Max probably made more then 100k in just his stream alone
[1:24:49] flebbooo: Overall i love this raid and it has some really cool fights i'm looking forward to on mythic. In terms of WF the obvious issues were length of the race and the ridiculous amounts of splis
[1:24:50] pavepawns: dude some of the top moments of the world first from echos point are hilarious. i dont think ive ever seen naowh be afraid of a boss dmg as he was at rygelon
[1:24:51] mooeees: they were so dejected
[1:24:51] signeddudu: That is true, he always have way more viewers than Liquid channel. It is the other way around for Echo...
[1:24:51] Collected1: nothing beats the max "lets fucking go" moments . i'll miss those.
[1:24:51] Kisswani: @Dagomarus I think it's because of comms
[1:24:53] 1s2real: In the last 30 days
[1:25:05] flebbooo: splits*
[1:25:14] cinnamints: People watch Liquid for comms, though. The main channel will never compete.
[1:25:26] 1s2real: Because feel like max is “There” Streamer
[1:25:28] tydrennistv: Would your rather have max or scripe as your shot caller/raid leader
[1:25:33] Dagomarus: @Kisswani they are muted alot of the time in progression, they still watch him, but the casting on liquids stream isnt as fun as echos

[1:25:35] Gingerprimer: Yeah but none of the big  esports orgs makes any money at all
[1:26:09] mk__9: @Gingerprimer they make money from cloth lines merch streams ..etc
[1:26:13] Yayamandua: @Gingerprimer arent they got moneyt from s[ponsorship?
[1:26:17] Thoreya: I hope players don’t start leaving liquid and joining other guilds
[1:26:17] Senthius09: max said that during the race, the money he gets from subs goes to the raiders, at least most of it
[1:26:27] Gingerprimer: @mk__9 I mean as in making a profit
[1:26:52] zerkx1: Liquid as a Org just needs to replace their talent with young but more dedicated to WoW talent
[1:27:01] Twyzted_f8: Signs go growth
[1:27:12] Twyzted_f8: Of
[1:27:13] Collected1: all they need to do is hook up all the small streams to a central system that plays ads on them all
[1:27:25] nezz231: they need to get better casters then because echos caster is soooo much better imo
[1:27:29] Demanisraar: I was mostly in Maax's channel because the Liquid channel was ass tbh... everytime I tuned in the main channel them casters where talking nonsense
[1:27:30] reggiepowa: echo had the majority of viewership on their main channel
[1:27:36] rambaldi00: Method has done an amazing job rebuilding the roster
[1:27:38] manmower: 10.0 should be coming by end of year if they keep to usual timeline
[1:27:42] fcwar_: Season 4 will be as successful as Season of Mastery
[1:27:42] pereadin: switch meters
[1:27:44] Senthius09: S4 i can see them doing a chill event for fun
[1:27:46] Shrenko: you are showing healing done
[1:27:47] Contendedlemon: theres hould be a season 4 tbh
[1:27:47] dollarnuggs: ur on healing done big dog :P
[1:27:48] sintax_24: Liquid casters were so bad
[1:27:52] Thoreya: Yeah. It doesn’t look good when echo main channel has 100k+ viewers and liquids main channel is max’s lol
[1:27:58] Contendedlemon: shouldnt be a season 4 *
[1:27:58] Nevindaz: 'cuse Preach KEKW
[1:28:04] AureliusXV: @sintax_24 agree
[1:28:05] Collected1: PEACH
[1:28:15] Shrenko: your meters are showing healing done @Towelliee
[1:28:15] Laluzmia: Well you are right Max is going to answer alot of questions
[1:28:16] jerkzttv: !wow10

[1:28:17] Demanisraar: @sintax_24 agree
[1:28:19] pavepawns: does liquid also have a main or not? i only really know of max from limit
[1:28:21] t0csik: when echo killed the jailor there were like 150k vieweres
[1:28:24] pavepawns: no hate legit question
[1:28:28] kraiyx: I don’t know why so people are so hype on max and liquid; they literally only have 2 end raid boss world firsts; they won’t win another world first now that echo is established
[1:28:33] monute316: unless he plans on not streaming
[1:28:34] Gingerprimer: @manmower bro we are getting a season 4 of SL this year so next expansion is not comming untill next year
[1:28:35] ahies28: the casters on echo's stream were way better
[1:28:36] nezz231: preach, dratnos and fatboss alex was so good together it was so much fun watching the echo stream
[1:28:38] Collected1: gravlaxxx : did he go home? i couldn't see him on the kill video
[1:28:46] Sulairn: i rather listen to the player and not the host
[1:29:03] gravlaxxx: @Collected1 was benched. He actually ended up casting the kill with preach and others
[1:29:04] Collected1: Lula kicked ass this tier also
[1:29:11] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:29:11] FleuryGG: Echo's main channel was far more watchable than TL's was, tbh.  The production value and having people like Preach
[1:29:22] Collected1: gravlaxxx : yeah i just couldn't see him in the studio yesterday maybe i missed him

[1:29:35] sLogOG: because of NA vs EU, liquid is NA hope since they won a couple. Adds a lot for the competition. @kraiyx
[1:29:43] gravlaxxx: @Collected1 was def there, sitting on the couch
[1:29:48] rambaldi00: Liquid came in 2nd and yall want to tear them apart and start over...bit extreme eh
[1:29:49] manmower: @gingerprimer maybe we'll find out in April
[1:29:51] Collected1: awesome good to ehar
[1:29:54] Collected1: * hear
[1:30:08] Collected1: Gingi's little "bad acting" outburst was a little unfortunate but he's a fired up guy
[1:30:08] vyranoth: preach?? didnt he quit
[1:30:23] pavepawns: dratnos was great
[1:30:24] kraiyx: @rambaldi00 liquid did not come in second lol; they aren’t done uet
[1:30:26] Gingerprimer: @darkrangersis wow yes casting no
[1:30:28] Demanisraar: The dynamic between casters was amazing at Echo's
[1:30:35] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP
[1:30:41] Gotxiko: preach didnt quit, just stopped covering wow on his channel
[1:30:45] Gotxiko: but he still plays wow
[1:30:51] nezz231: he doesnt play wow but he love the rwf
[1:30:55] Lynasz: i think the liquid casters were also really great tbh. if i look at method channel for instance (without flame) its less enjoyable than liquid and echo channel
[1:30:56] FleuryGG: Lula was the only saving grace for Liquid's stream LUL
[1:31:00] Demanisraar: He still plays wow, just not covering it on his channel anymore
[1:31:01] Nevindaz: KEKW he is in love with ffxiv
[1:31:12] Collected1: he will be back for 10.0 like everyone else
[1:31:23] rohdey: pretty sure Preach says he still plays, just not to the degree he did prior to SL
[1:31:24] Nevindaz: even in hamburg at rwf he played a bit before casts
[1:31:27] GrampyBeav: What’s in 23 days 4 hours 43 minutes @towelliee
[1:31:29] Collected1: just when you think you're out, they pull you back in

[1:32:31] Demanisraar: Skip time Kappa
[1:32:52] monute316: echo just seems so much more put together from top to bottom not sure if it's really a race anymore tbh
[1:33:06] Thoreya: ^ agreed
[1:33:19] CritcobainTV: towHAMUP Morning fellas
[1:33:30] AureliusXV: would be hilarious if meth got second
[1:33:59] Lynasz: method already said they probably need another reset though hehe, would be awesome though ye, agreed
[1:34:05] Bryan2874: was kina rooting for Liquid low key but Echo was just better overall lol
[1:34:10] reggiepowa: method will stop day raiding tomorrow
[1:34:28] sintax_24: to be fair i dont think liquid would even care if they didnt get 2nd. If you arnt first it doesnt matter
[1:34:29] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[1:34:30] manmower: this seemed like a battle of endurance this time
[1:35:29] mrz_as: all things considered this was a great race
[1:35:29] AureliusXV: just like lost ark
[1:35:42] tydrennistv: Do you think will have alliance guilds now with cross faction for the wf
[1:35:42] manmower: 10.0 is gonna be the biggest xpac in wow history
[1:35:44] KragnosWoW: its the same with every sport
[1:35:52] manmower: those file sizes are gonna be huge
[1:35:56] TigasLIVE: @Towelliee What do you think will be the next wow xpac for 18th april?
[1:36:22] monute316: liquid excelled all the way up to the boy king the last 3 bosses is echo took over which is a testament to the behind the scenes members of there team
[1:36:33] Thewunk: Thewunk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[1:36:34] CritcobainTV: Idk if you need more keys but i have a 17 NW @Towelliee
[1:36:36] manmower: Marathon to World First - time for the rename
[1:36:40] dSaipher: did they actually nerf the jailer health mid fight yesterday>?
[1:36:50] AureliusXV: limit let us down
[1:36:58] CritcobainTV: ahh, gotcha
[1:37:13] lolgiff: gambit is way easier
[1:37:19] Demanisraar: Gambit is really doable this week
[1:37:24] Scoodles91: gambit is kinda easy, just the murloc part is anoying
[1:37:41] lolgiff: i got an 18 gambit if you want to do it lol
[1:38:23] Zeke_nl: It was too long, you could tell liquid was down, the morale seemed pretty low. Can’t blame them being away for 18 days grinding 12- hours a day doing the same stuff. Max made the right choice. Bigger things than RWF
[1:38:25] KragnosWoW: why do people say that lol
[1:38:36] CritcobainTV: i just need streets and gambit i think at 15 timed and i can get ksm, might have to time the DoS key that i have at 17 untimed
[1:38:44] Demanisraar: I hope it's good, because I for one are not going to play S4 LUL
[1:38:53] Demanisraar: Time for a break for me then
[1:39:07] KragnosWoW: wasnt 10.0 made by all the staff that got fired or quit
[1:39:23] Collected1: if they open up all classes to all races, i'm back baby
[1:40:56] kraiyx: @zeke_nl morale got low because they got behind in the race and couldn’t catch back up; their jailer prog was pretty bad; they knew they weren’t going to win so called it early
[1:41:28] Demanisraar: @Collected1 yes, gibe me my Kul tiran paladin!
[1:41:58] Dathas487: 100% big ups on the call to make for the players' sake
[1:42:02] Ezekyler: yes, they needed a break no need to keep pushing at that point
[1:42:02] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:42:06] eyemyor: It was a good move.  Echo was clearly better this tier, but Liquid did well, and Max was doing a great job looking out for hius guys.
[1:42:06] tydrennistv: Last time I saw guild feel defeated like this was back in end of wod when mythic ran down midwinter
[1:42:29] KragnosWoW: thd lost ark main now Kappa
[1:42:33] SamAddams: Yeah they knew they weren’t going to win. Just do the 2nd place finish Monday and be in better spirits
[1:42:45] Syprus1: In their minds the race was over as soon as echo won. theres 1 st place then the rest are tired for last
[1:42:47] manmower: you age out at around 30
[1:43:00] tocu: I think the partners and the rest of the org likely backs his choice from a financial place as well as the hype of the race plummets and with it the income
[1:43:24] ColdIceCreamMan: I think, if it was communicated by Blizz, that this tier could take a lot longer it wouldn't have been such a weird ending.
[1:43:31] Bryan2874: 2 weeks straight of just straight up raiding thats insane
[1:44:47] swervity82: their 4 piece

[1:44:48] Highparkk_: totally respect liquid's decision
[1:44:48] Djfarmville: tier pieces for dh is busted
[1:44:50] KragnosWoW: Now we need a race to see who will get the first shadowmourne in classic Kappa
[1:44:54] nclemen24: 26 days in total
[1:44:58] Adraythien: They just press buttons SeriousSloth
[1:45:12] tocu: I think it can be put on 2 thing the hardest boss was in the  middle of the raid followed by 4 more bosses that were either no joke or very much tuned for haivng double lego
[1:45:32] Collected1: to me it felt like two raids in one
[1:45:35] Collected1: the crab was the first end boss

[1:45:42] sinlesssinner: i think Liquid pulls way too much for the amount of progress they do in every pull. Its not a skill thing, but a management thing. Echo takes much longer between pulls, saves em some stamina in the long run @Towelliee
[1:45:52] AndersKool: yeah demon hunter is really easy to play and also really fun and really good dmg haha, only possible downside is surviveability which is mostly relevant in PvP
[1:45:57] KragnosWoW: anduin fight was the most entertaining
[1:46:00] Jomuse92: Halondris alone looked like a final boss
[1:46:09] tocu: it was likely a the bosses designed for the dross raid added to the jailer raid just a reskin on the dross stuff
[1:46:26] Highparkk_: @sinlesssinner i also feel like echo takes more breaks, not 100% sure but that could help with their mental as well
[1:46:30] cinnamints: @Collected1 Agreed, and then each phase of the Jailer was like a separate boss in terms of progression.
[1:46:31] pereadin: yeah was me
[1:46:43] kraiyx: @sinlesssinner agree for sure; liquid sometimes refuses to change up and just beat their head against it because that’s their strat
[1:46:57] Jomuse92: My man made a gamer move and typed it up in chat GIGACHAD
[1:47:09] sinlesssinner: @Highparkk_ yea, its what it feels like for sure
[1:47:18] Twyzted_f8: See if they stack
[1:47:44] tocu: Also im of the mind while Echo won I dont think Liquid lost they still were playing out of their minds and achieved some truly impressive s tuff
[1:47:51] Highparkk_: @sinlesssinner i think as soon as liquid lost scott they should of considered chilling that's a huge loss, but the last 2 days or so their pulls you could see how tired/mentally done they were with the rwf lol
[1:48:05] Highparkk_: @tocu 100% dude, was a great race
[1:48:09] kraiyx: I think some of the big motivation for echo was when max said lords of dread was unkillable so they went to rygelon and then echo came in and killed it the next day
[1:48:30] monute316: echo roster was insane because of splits
[1:48:32] kraiyx: That just pushed echo even harder
[1:48:36] 91Niki: You mean a lot of sweaty nerds in EU Kappa
[1:48:39] pixxelina: pixelins subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:48:47] Highparkk_: echo didn't even seem phased by how long it was taking, that's some crazy dedication
[1:48:52] AndersKool: healther diet, more focus on physical exercise is what made the stamina difference to be totally honest
[1:49:05] Collected1: we go "long" in the EU if you know what i mean
[1:49:13] kraiyx: Echo did do a crazy amount of splits
[1:49:14] fistofnature: sunwell or Tombs ?
[1:49:21] tocu: I think its also echo just has better chemistry so the stamina just doesnt go down as fast
[1:49:23] Highparkk_: sunwell
[1:49:27] KragnosWoW: dont worry, theres a bigger baddie coming and theyll have a chance to kill that next raid
[1:49:28] Exoduc: @AndersKool chugging ELX morning midday and dinner KEKW
[1:49:31] Jarlan23: that sounds fucking awful 1500 attempts jfc
[1:49:38] Jarlan23: i'd quit wow at that point i couldnt do it
[1:49:40] Armdel: livestreaming the rwf didn't really start until late legion early bfa iirc
[1:49:45] AndersKool: what is ELX ? :D
[1:49:46] Highparkk_: @KragnosWoW jailer did what he did to stop someone who was more bad from doing what they wanna do Kappa
[1:50:05] Alexkayzz: Race to week first KEKW
[1:50:11] Collected1: it depends how long each attempt is. the average attempt length changes a lot.
[1:50:12] ijuki: Is it confirmed that the raid is weekly in s4? monkaS
[1:50:13] MarquisLek: season 4 looks like season of mastery but shadowlands
[1:50:16] Wcvechten: Tyrannical Sylvanas let's goi
[1:50:17] Shatraugh: Tyrannical KEKL
[1:50:19] Jomuse92: That would cost too much money xD
[1:50:22] tocu: how many pulls occured on kaelthas before it was figure out he was impossible ?
[1:50:27] BlinkHeals: They arent adding m+ affixes
[1:50:29] Luthaer: it would be a league/season
[1:50:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: !wow10

[1:51:01] Heavymetal87: Tyrannical Myth Sylv? Lawd
[1:51:11] ijuki: @lithium364 monkaS
[1:51:13] Collected1: i think some raiders will still be rocking back and forth in the corner of a room
[1:51:30] Gotxiko: its just gonna be some new abilities to bosses on nm/hc for mythic gear, no crazy stuff, just some fun stuff to do at the end of exp
[1:51:30] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[1:51:56] Tobysina: @Towelliee Have I missed the LoTS playthrough?
[1:52:09] KragnosWoW: I personally want wrath classic instead of season 4
[1:52:12] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[1:52:15] 91Niki: Don't jinx it monkaS
[1:52:39] Gotxiko: season4 is just a testing ground on how players react for a 10.0 "evergreen raids" system
[1:52:43] Gingerprimer: @KragnosWoW tbf that is also comming
[1:53:04] Scoodles91: 2.5
[1:53:05] Aquadriel: 25
[1:53:08] Shrenko: 2500
[1:53:09] pereadin: 2500 ksm 3K ksh
[1:53:10] Demanisraar: 2500
[1:53:15] Heavymetal87: 2500 pretty easy to get
[1:53:19] Shrenko: its easypeasy!
[1:53:22] Heavymetal87: all 15s pretty much
[1:53:24] Jarlan23: 2.5 is just all 15s right?
[1:53:33] Epidoral: I just failed TOP 15 with 45 deaths hehe
[1:53:34] pereadin: pass lead senor
[1:53:40] Demanisraar: I'm already 2200+ and feel like I didn't even do much
[1:53:42] Twyzted_f8: Interrupt time
[1:53:42] lithium364: are you gonna play tiny tinas wonderlands at bruv night?
[1:53:52] Collected1: Towelliee : are you starting an org with Lore?
[1:53:54] Heavymetal87: PF and Gambit would give you a shitload of points
[1:54:00] sinlesssinner: 15s of both tyra and fort. thats 2500 ez
[1:54:12] Collected1: LUL
[1:54:17] emznev: KEKW
[1:54:17] BlinkHeals: Sounds like a yes
[1:54:21] Thunderbrew: @Collected1 Sounds like no
[1:54:29] lolgiff: i got an 18 gambit
[1:54:29] KragnosWoW: Lore, towelliee and chris metzen org POGGERS
[1:54:31] Demanisraar: Gambit is pretty fun this week
[1:54:34] Collected1: he knows
[1:54:35] Contendedlemon: are you starting an orgimmar with lore
[1:54:37] emznev: @Collected1 GIVE ME WHAT EVER YOU ARE SMOKING  ;)
[1:54:38] propoopimus: tyrannical easier this xpac
[1:54:44] Gingerprimer: Gambit is free with the WA for the console
[1:54:54] Heavymetal87: I think you still get a good chunk for time
[1:55:05] pereadin: I have the WA
[1:55:18] propoopimus: ya, just pick up orb tells you were to go
[1:55:26] Gingerprimer: Yeah the pirate trash is nasty tho
[1:55:27] pereadin: Pass lead :)
[1:55:29] Twyzted_f8: What’s it called
[1:55:40] aznamir: you don't have to time any key, just close enough gives you enough score
[1:55:40] Twyzted_f8: The WA that is
[1:55:42] KragnosWoW: Realistically what ilvl should dps be for +15s? i kinda want that KSM re color
[1:55:48] BlinkHeals: On friday liquid was memeing all day
[1:56:04] Thoreya: Liquid won’t win a race in 10.0
[1:56:08] Thoreya: That’s my hot take
[1:56:19] Demanisraar: @KragnosWoW my group is around 262 now and we are timing  15's but that is without pugs and such
[1:56:21] donin: 4 weeks in a hotel is miserable period
[1:56:24] Teebees: un-organized
[1:56:25] pereadin: @KragnosWoW Depends on the individual player.  Good players can get KSM at 250 ilevel easily.  But you'll probably want 260-262
[1:56:25] emznev: ECHO ARE TO GOOD
[1:56:39] Dcarter: if your doing dungeons towelliee im down
[1:56:45] CrimsonNurse: Blizzard fixed the spell timings for LOD after Liquid went to bed that night after Max said it was unkillable.
[1:56:53] cinnamints: IDK if that was motivating b/c the LoD "unkillable" thing was a misunderstanding viewers ran with. Liquid only said they couldn't do it with that comp, so they switched. And they did LoD once they mathed out a good comp.
[1:56:53] 91Niki: @Dcarter sacWAVE
[1:56:54] lolgiff: 15s only need like 9k overall maybe
[1:56:55] tocu: I also was not a fan of Liquid having a crypto sponsor on their jersey
[1:57:16] KragnosWoW: rip im only 251 lol
[1:57:18] VandreadFeld: that .6% tho
[1:57:25] BlinkHeals: @tocu why would that matter
[1:57:33] Dcarter: dcwHi
[1:57:36] 1s2real: Love watching you blast keys
[1:57:39] Nevindaz: Lorgok and Gingi sodaSubs
[1:57:40] Jarlan23: i didnt watch much liquid this race they had the chat in sub mode for most of it
[1:57:41] cazhually: everything after haldondrus just went to poop for liquid
[1:57:44] ndogg76: They played well but had some luck on some pulls
[1:57:45] emznev: Method doing well this time around to
[1:57:50] Twyzted_f8: Zaelia’s insane lifegrips
[1:57:52] Demanisraar: Same, I use coinbase a lot
[1:57:53] cazhually: halndrus was like amazing show of improvement from SOD
[1:58:13] pixxelina: pretty insane one
[1:58:20] Drogdorf: and when the holes didnt open KEKW
[1:58:20] vandervalor: u done with lost ark?
[1:58:25] Demanisraar: yeah that was weird af, the look on their faces was priceless LUL
[1:58:27] Gingerprimer: @Jarlan23 tbh chat pre sub mode was kind of trash
[1:58:28] Exoduc: Listening to comms when that happened Scripe called it and told them not to panic
[1:58:33] theonekink: is there a video of the world 1st raid? @towelliee
[1:58:57] Djfarmville: PepeLaugh
[1:58:57] Shrenko: gambit is kinda monkaS
[1:58:57] pereadin: We got this bro lol
[1:58:59] KragnosWoW: 2 hour key inc KEKW
[1:58:59] Demanisraar: It's fine
[1:59:04] Wcvechten: I had a good laugh when all the  swirlies spawned Defiles the first time it happened
[1:59:05] tocu: @BlinkHeals Its a me thing not a effect of the raid but I am sure im not the only one in that camp still likely minority
[1:59:05] pereadin: Nah you'll be fine
[1:59:05] pavepawns: i mean its not baaad
[1:59:08] Jarlan23: @Gingerprimer yea maybe but without chat i might as well watch a lets play or something its not as fun
[1:59:13] BlinkHeals: @Towelliee I worked and could watch every liquid pull and you could tell on friday they were done they were just memeing and had like 20 pulls dieing in first phase
[1:59:14] pavepawns: 1st part of gambit is annoying
[1:59:15] Djfarmville: Second boss gonna be interesting
[1:59:17] pavepawns: the murlocs D;
[1:59:18] AureliusXV: can we get a prediction on this one
[1:59:31] propoopimus: i think more the last boss will be fun :)
[1:59:31] Twyzted_f8: Once they knew the swirlies dropped all defiles in phase 4 it was over
[1:59:32] 1s2real: you can get a mount at the end of it
[1:59:40] 1s2real: The black recolor
[1:59:45] Demanisraar: if you did HM, this will be easy boss tacs wise
[1:59:47] Fireman17: What you think about the Jailer Mount
[1:59:52] AureliusXV: shits easy i did a 21

[2:00:00] yorish: checked both stream and I think echo won becouse they can joke around and have fun even if it not went well allways
[2:00:04] Jarlan23: theres a cute little dragon mount that wears a hat in ff14
[2:00:28] Exoduc: We never saw Gorak tul after waycrest manor, he said he would be waiting in shadowlands, where is he?
[2:00:49] Collected1: no dog barking is a bad sign
[2:00:57] cazhually: i think they definitely have to repalce some gamers
[2:01:04] Sielu11628: Everyone thinks 10.0 will be dragons, I'm not against Dragons (would laugh if it's something else, though)
[2:01:05] propoopimus: echo just has some of the best players in world
[2:01:09] cazhually: like they have to anticipate this long of a race next time
[2:01:12] nitemare34godd: @Towelliee my dad just told me tom brady got traded to dophins you was right
[2:01:13] tocu: Echo went through the fire of coming from an org that had to get 99% reset and the bond is likely just way tighter
[2:01:13] 1s2real: They go recruit in my opinion . Get some new blood
[2:01:15] donin: when people are falling into holes in p1 hundreds of pulls in, theres really nothing you can say
[2:01:26] 1s2real: Trill left for AWC
[2:01:28] Collected1: the hotel move via a limo wasn't ideal
[2:01:29] kraiyx: At that point on Friday they knew they had lost honestly
[2:01:29] PvtHudson093: I think Blizz needs to take into account the final tuning of those bosses
[2:01:30] Peqdevil: Max said when they changed the raid comp on Jailer they didnt progress for 2 days
[2:01:32] BlinkHeals: I really dont think they planned on this raid going 3 weeks
[2:01:37] Jarlan23: @nitemare34godd ?????

[2:32:32] PadidinJones: @Towelliee is it me or did the jailor go down too fast for Mythic kill?
[2:32:39] Twyzted_f8: Halondrus was just paying us back for all the missed turtles
[2:32:48] Blvdman: too long @PadidinJones lol

[2:33:57] movaria: getting io is so slow this szn
[2:34:00] redraidah: they just got rwf?
[2:34:03] jkitchin75: @PadidinJones it 2 weeks how that fast
[2:34:11] dudeimunknown: Whats ksm?
[2:34:17] Walshey: 1500 pulls in the entire raid that part is insane
[2:34:28] Ezekyler: @dudeimunknown Keystone Master
[2:34:31] PadidinJones: @PadidinJones I mean the Jailor alone. Not the whole raid
[2:34:44] Blvdman: pretty sure my guild would disband if it took 250 attempts for 1 kill just to not get loot lol
[2:34:51] mizerboy: what do you need for ksm?
[2:34:56] miguelapple: 18 days "too short" LuL
[2:35:12] CritcobainTV: RWF should've been longer imo Kappa
[2:35:18] bigjuicystan: these bosses are gonna get hard nerfed in a week or two
[2:35:19] Jarlan23: @Blvdman it took my guild like 300 tries on m sludgefist after the raid we lost about half our members lol
[2:35:27] tocu: @PadidinJones the other thing to think of many of the echo people were near BIS gear thats not a thing that has hapened in any other streamed tier it would have looked harder if they were say halondrus was a normalish boss i think youget at least 2 more days on jailer prereset
[2:35:31] K0rzak0v: @mizerboy 2500 score
[2:35:36] pereadin: LFG looking pretty dry right now

[2:36:58] lumaday: yea
[2:36:59] CritcobainTV: @Jarlan23 by the FP in oribos
[2:37:00] pereadin: Yeah, but hps sims are pretty inaccurate

[2:38:13] snickletoe: have to take care of yourself. too much of a stigma on that shit.
[2:38:29] Blvdman: @Jarlan23 Yea my brain was out at that point, worst part never got loot from it, cleared Mythic, and most loot was from M+ cuz of bad rng

[2:39:40] kraiyx: Echo org stream was so much better than liquids as far as cast crew and production quality
[2:39:40] PvtHudson093: haemorrhoids ?
[2:39:50] Jarlan23: @Blvdman yea it 100% kinda breaks people. i did prog raiding in natheria and after we beat sludgefist i decided it wasnt for me
[2:40:03] c0mmander_starscream: and less "Sweaty"
[2:40:07] thunder993: not sure why don't they do it from home
[2:40:17] cazhually: Personnel wise they’re going to turn over half their roster.
[2:40:32] CptReymious: @Jarlan23 i did the same.
[2:40:40] relios898: Yeah I think with the non-optimal location and length made it hard on Liquid. They will definitely come back much better in 10.0
[2:40:40] 1s2real: It’s called Hemorrhoids
[2:41:26] cazhually: I think that echo will get bought
[2:41:27] jkitchin75: do you get a mount for ksm
[2:41:30] monute316: waiting on that @towelliee liquid content creator announcement
[2:41:50] Aidler: I’m sure Liquid will win the next tier… Max will do anything for it
[2:41:59] Nico_vdM: @jkitchin75 yes red version

[2:42:25] Ezekyler: Hammer Squad aqcuires Echo? Kappa
[2:42:25] jaysteea: do they need to get bought? like they could be their own bosses
[2:42:26] cazhually: Some org will definitely offer the right price now
[2:42:27] relios898: After this performance by Echo only feels like a matter of time until an org picks them up

[2:42:59] Jarlan23: i got my trinket out of DoS after 3 runs super happy about that
[2:43:07] thunder993: @thunderbrew no, completely community driven
[2:43:13] jerseyfive: limit didn't even care anymore they just wanted it to end no matter who wins
[2:43:16] wolfster72: do u think it's because they are basically method 2.0 so people were leary still
[2:43:20] jerseyfive: *liquid
[2:43:26] Thunderbrew: Why isn't Blizzard involved?
[2:43:27] Aidler: are we sure the Echo guys want to be bought?
[2:43:42] relios898: It does feel like Blizz needs to try to address the level of splits that happen, don't know the right solution though
[2:43:44] Jarlan23: why wouldnt they its a ton of money for them
[2:43:45] jaysteea: @Aidler my thoughts exactly
[2:43:50] TimoShan: @jaysteea its about money and organization. IF they are bought it relieves scripe and others of organization duties to focus on raiding/recruiting etc. instead of dealing with sponsers, coordinating casters, getting a venue, dealing with hr etc. They would also get paid.
[2:43:50] CrimsonNurse: I disagree that Echo had better production, the boss health bar, energy bars, enrage timer, battle rez counter, etc was great on the liquid stream. Only thing that Echo had better was Dratnos and Preach.
[2:43:59] ahies28: comfirmed towelliee to buy echo
[2:44:25] snickletoe: blizz benefits, so yes
[2:44:47] BlinkHeals: Look at otk they had to get rid of teams
[2:44:51] Jarlan23: @CrimsonNurse echo had tons of sponsers they had gingi doing a bunch of commercials for stuff
[2:44:55] Snabido: Towelliee contribution would be a mini beer fridge as sponsorship Kappa
[2:45:00] ahies28: lm sure companies have tried to buy echo
[2:45:31] monute316: craft beer sponsorship
[2:45:49] BlinkHeals: @Towelliee look at otk they had to get rid of teams before they even got to compete
[2:46:25] CrimsonNurse: @jarlan23 that’s not good production value thats advertising. As a viewer I would rather not see ads, though I understand they need the sponsors to make money to pay for the event. I thought we were talking about production value.

[2:47:05] Jarlan23: @CrimsonNurse tbh i saw energy bar and thought you were talking about sponsors lol mb
[2:47:20] Sollice: Did anyone play Tina Tina's Wonderland yet? I normally dont play Borderlands game but it looked kidn of cool
[2:47:55] CrimsonNurse: @jarlan23 yeah the boss fight info at the bottom of the Liquid stream was awesome
[2:48:00] 1s2real: The review have been pretty good
[2:48:02] Shrenko: Im waiting for it to come to Steam
[2:48:09] Hybridwarhawk: I'm enjoying Wonderland a bunch
[2:48:24] Aidler: @sollice streamerhouse is playing it right now
[2:50:11] Tausgi: looks good. and they added attributes. But no armor pieces still :/ Need more customization imo

[2:50:36] Nokterian: @Sollice Keep hearing is as good as it was with BL2 dlc and i like BL2 a lot more than BL3.
[2:51:16] Sollice: Yeah maybe we will try it. Good be fun
[2:51:22] 1s2real: BL 2 is better then BL3
[2:51:34] 1s2real: The OG hero’s were pog
[2:52:07] Deadcells: Liquid lost because they weren’t as focused on the jailer as Echo
[2:52:38] Nokterian: Liquid did so many pulls on the jailer compared on what we saw echo doing
[2:52:56] Nokterian: thats why they burned themselfs out
[2:53:15] Nico_vdM: and his name is Bron Cena
[2:53:25] Deadcells: But what they were doing wasn’t working and they didn’t find the right combo
[2:53:27] kraiyx: Liquid made like no prog the last days
[2:53:36] ExTrackGaming: What nameplate addon does he use?
[2:54:08] Senthius09: losing scott for a bit, and then losing trill because of AWC didnt help
[2:54:08] Moskeebee: Echo seems to play more serious overall imo..on every bodd
[2:54:23] Nebulizer87: 3x Warlock pumping / don’t take dmg
[2:54:26] relios898: Echo's level of consistency was ridiculous
[2:54:28] Nokterian: they had amazing synergy like it was a ballet doing it all perfect together
[2:54:38] Kisswani: After Halondrus I was expecting Liquid to take it all . but man did Echo pick it up after Anduin
[2:54:38] Deadcells: They changed their warrior to arms and that was the kicker
[2:54:46] Nebulizer87: Plz god just take warlocks out the game lol
[2:55:16] Nokterian: Demo Lock is POG still amazing to see how long it was in the shadows from affliction and destro
[2:55:24] Twyzted_f8: @nebulizer87 nope we need buffs
[2:55:33] BlinkHeals: First raid in a long time that the end boss didnt mean 5 hunters
[2:55:34] Twyzted_f8: Lol
[2:55:38] Moskeebee: @Nebulizer87 had a warlock soloing quazars on H Ryg last night LUL
[2:55:42] Kisswani: @Twyzted_f8 true
[2:55:54] Nokterian: truth there
[2:55:56] Twyzted_f8: At least aff
[2:56:15] Nebulizer87: Demo lock was 3k above everyone on kill pull balanced
[2:56:15] Quojin: They won because Scribe let someone go for  a pee at a 3% pull
[2:56:16] Saikwondo: How much was your magic rooster @Towelliee ?
[2:56:39] Kisswani: Skollex or whatever didn't need to exist at all , I could do without Lihivum too LUL
[2:56:42] timmypee10: Blizzard actually showed they can create bosses and not put them on the PTR
[2:56:42] Nebulizer87: Race was way too long and no reason to timegate double leggos if you balanced the raid around them
[2:56:51] Twyzted_f8: @nebulizer87 PI
[2:57:02] Nevindaz: I think it's also the mentality.. as Max sayed the way they're playing is more focused on the individual type of gameplay style like everyone is aware and need to know only what they need to know ..
[2:57:16] c0mmander_starscream: @Quojin I thought that breaking raid etiqute for not using a "Bottle"
[2:58:18] Quojin: @c0mmander_starscream must of ran out of bottles lol
[2:59:22] BlinkHeals: @Towelliee Thats the only thing that sucks with Teir and RWF
[2:59:57] gsting: just make all gear untradable
[2:59:58] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[3:00:12] Blvdman: Why are they designing it around those guilds tho?
[3:00:13] CrimsonNurse: Why not make major changes to the gearing system for 10.0
[3:00:23] Folgrum: soon even 1st boss will be designed with 4 tier items and last boss loot :P
[3:00:26] Kisswani: Yeah , I think Blizz reacts to the degeneracy of the players , they dont cause it
[3:00:33] gsting: make bop actually bop not oh my guildy needs this
[3:00:40] Nebulizer87: just give them master loot
[3:00:53] Nokterian: thinks at the start of BFA where you indeed couldn't trade Azerite gear
[3:00:54] 1s2real: Master looter for mythic prog
[3:00:56] BlinkHeals: Make gear untradeable and trade to vendor for valor to upgrade gear
[3:00:58] QQuirashi: the rogue name is 10/10 LOL
[3:01:00] jcbear011: Yeah nah I agree with you my guild will be gear trading like mfsss full gear in a day
[3:01:02] smashwow: i feel like them tuning the bosses for X gear required only feeds that loop of splits and design etc
[3:01:10] jaysteea: yeah and tune bosses harder so one race is like a month or more
[3:01:10] themadbunny275: is it because there are not determinist ways of getting gear?
[3:01:11] kraiyx: Make full guild runs able to use master loot
[3:01:14] Blvdman: @Kisswani the degeneracy only applies mostly to those bleeding edge, average player isn't really trying to do all that shit
[3:01:28] smashwow: those guilds will just do what they have to, to get X gear. it's kind of inherent to the situation

[3:02:05] Kisswani: @Blvdman true , which is why Blizz isn't really focused on it . I think we both agree that we dont want blizz to do something to stop splits that will hurt the rest of the playerbase
[3:02:11] Blvdman: I still want every raid boss to drop either gear or a token for those who dont get gear, so everyone gets loot 100%. Shitty to spend a whole raid night on 1 boss and not get loot once killed.
[3:02:16] Collected1: HE KNOWS
[3:02:21] Senthius09: just give the tier sets out in the campaign and have the creation catalyst just upgrade them using the tier token drop from the boss
[3:02:25] Kisswani: Fully tradeable personal gear . lets go
[3:02:31] Collected1: 188
[3:02:31] Nokterian: A LOT
[3:02:31] theNebuchadnezzar: @Towelliee  what u mean normalized?

[3:02:34] Peqdevil: 3 days worth
[3:02:35] Collected1: according to fragnance
[3:02:43] Nokterian: dear god
[3:02:43] jcbear011: @blvdman bro thank you I’m so sick of fucking running raids and m+ getting fucking nothing
[3:02:55] Saikwondo: How much was your magic rooster @Towelliee
[3:02:59] Shrenko: bless them
[3:03:01] jcbear011: Like I get m+ drops insane gear but why the fick is it not 100% if I spend that long doing it
[3:03:02] Collected1: they're going to be doing carry runs for months to pay back the debt
[3:03:04] s_t_o_r_m__: What's so bad about splits?
[3:03:15] Kisswani: @Senthius09 that's not a bad idea . I think the only thing stopping them from doing that is wanting raids to have something special
[3:03:31] SensationalBanana: SensationalBanana subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 66 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Awesome to be back watching your stream!

[3:03:38] Nokterian: Master Loot made it so much easier
[3:03:49] falldrgn: Imean thats the price of being the best..
[3:03:54] nathrizen: sync ilvl mythic raid, boooom *drops mic*
[3:03:55] Blvdman: I mean TECHNICALLY, splits are only effective if people help the guilds out and join them
[3:03:59] yeti82: I hear Echo borrowed over 900 mill gold ? is that true ?
[3:04:06] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  some1 needs to give a medal to justwait and grim. those two guys did everything related to the splits and weakauras and such
[3:04:18] Aidler: true splits are no crowd pleasers
[3:04:27] SensationalBanana: @yeti82 I would not be surprised if it was true.
[3:04:34] CrimsonNurse: Just take gear away from the raid bosses, make the gear that you need obtainable from another aspect outside of the raid. Remove the RNG and make it guaranteed reward. That way Blizzard knows what you are going to be wearing and can tune boss fights better.
[3:04:35] yeti82: damn
[3:04:37] SensationalBanana: They spend insane amounts of gold for these races.
[3:04:38] joyousboyous: @falldrgn It shouldnt be, thats the problem
[3:04:47] Rottencoarse: also i heard that potter didnt want to do that many splits lol he was begging scripe to stop

[3:33:56] Jarlan23: but i already finished that @OHNOTHER
[3:34:07] ohnot___her: @Jarlan23 How much renown do you have
[3:34:20] possibly_dave: then probably torghast spam?
[3:34:20] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[3:34:25] xplicit39: Necrotic Wake is great this week
[3:34:30] Jarlan23: i want to level venthyr and maldraxxus and they both at 0
[3:34:36] Sielu11628: I don’t think I’ve ever anticipated an expansion reveal as much as this upcoming one for 10.0
[3:34:47] hrdstylem: wish they would give us an 80 renown boa token thing
[3:34:50] Scarhearth: Night fae brewmaster is apparently very good now @Towelliee
[3:34:53] possibly_dave: @Jarlan23 well you can instantly boost them to 40 with that item from the oribos vendor
[3:34:56] xplicit39: 10.0 in VR

[3:35:08] Nico_vdM: I did a mini Sloot and got all 4 covenants to 80 on my main
[3:35:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yay dragons!
[3:35:09] Sollice: WITH MAGIC WATER
[3:35:18] Sollice: Did they fire that guy yet? The magic water guy
[3:35:21] peinen: YES
[3:35:26] Arbszy: What happens if next expansion has nothing to do with dragons and it is the just the red herring.
[3:35:30] bigjuicystan: the next expansion is not gonna happen this year
[3:35:36] Jarlan23: they should get the same guy who did the garrosh cutscene in sanctum to do the new expansion trailer
[3:35:38] RustproofSage: im expecting nothing but im disappointed already
[3:35:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Player housing would be fun, but I'm not expecting that anytime soon
[3:35:54] PvtHudson093: A new class would generate a lot ohype
[3:35:56] Jarlan23: i think if the engine could support player housing they would have done it already
[3:35:57] relios898: I am pretty much hoping for the blizzcon experience which is the cgi, gameplay trailer and then 40 min of expansion explanation. I am full of copium though
[3:36:00] Jarlan23: i dont think theyre able to do it
[3:36:03] Kameellian: I can see them do one christmas season
[3:36:05] theNebuchadnezzar: @Towelliee  i just want it to be good , who cares if we dont have it this year
[3:36:06] Kameellian: Or early next year
[3:36:15] Xannah08: any chance they can bring in Galakrond in some way? Arthas tried to raise him in WotLK, maybe someone else can?
[3:36:18] Aidler: @towelliee when do you expect the beta to start?
[3:36:19] drkillljoy: ragingpaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[3:36:59] rehabz97: my bet is alpha in december beta in march next year and then a may/june release
[3:37:02] PvtHudson093: If August is the start of s4 then New Expac is Feb/March next year
[3:37:12] Leofric84: They will push it out in Nov this year if I had to guess, probably bare bones base of an expac with the major features coming 6 months after
[3:37:19] N3llee: Good Morning Towel.
[3:37:44] CrimsonNurse: I do not understand the player housing want in games I have never enjoyed it in any game that I have played. Is there a game that blew it out of the park that I missed and everyone is yearning for again?
[3:37:47] N3llee: yo that one leak from china looked good
[3:38:16] omaahm96: Hi bro👋 Retail question. I’m writing this comment from PRISON. Does this mean I should be #1 on the leaderboards since I got to THE JAILER first? Thanks for your feedback ❤️
[3:38:33] Sollice: @omaahm96 ....
[3:38:34] Leofric84: I always thought Blizz's attempt on player housing was the Garrison
[3:38:36] 91Niki: whaa
[3:38:44] Jarlan23: @CrimsonNurse some people like it and ant to have it. i dont really care about it personally
[3:38:49] LeideGaming: you're missing arroz with that bistec Kappa
[3:38:50] Jarlan23: though it would be good for crafting professions
[3:38:58] Snabido: F Wildstar PepeHands
[3:38:58] Buckwink: Wildstar PepeHands
[3:39:03] lithium364: peak leakseason will start the week before the 19th, unless of course some incompetent press site leaks everything again just like the blizzconline 9.1 LUL
[3:39:07] PvtHudson093: Id rather have Guild housing
[3:39:07] Zander_TheGamer: SWTOR's player housing is great too
[3:39:09] 91Niki: @omaahm96 Don't you have homework to do or something?
[3:39:16] akia03: ff14 housing is k horizon had awesome housing
[3:39:17] theNebuchadnezzar: Wild star was grat, and hoverboards
[3:39:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: FFXIV has some good player housing with their FC/guild houses, something like that could be cool
[3:39:38] Jarlan23: i honestly believe if WoW could s support player housing that they would have done it a lready
[3:39:50] Jarlan23: its either the servers or the old ass game engine that doesnt allow it
[3:39:52] lithium364: yeah its gotta be an engine issue
[3:39:58] Sollice: @omaahm96 Oh they have all sorts of other things to do in prison...
[3:40:00] comp1: rework fishing to new world fishing
[3:40:05] Lavani: the great thing about player housing is, if you dont like it dont do it, no reason not to have it hough.
[3:40:06] HorseDaddy42069: What is meant by Player Housing?
[3:40:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah or just reuse airships for guild halls lol
[3:40:17] PvtHudson093: Only if we can move the garriosn around to different places
[3:40:30] CrimsonNurse: I played both Wildstar and SWTOR and it was ehh. I feel like housing is antimmo, it not group content its solo alone time.
[3:40:38] 91Niki: @omaahm96 I just assumed it was a kid with that kinda comment. Just cuz it's Sunday doesn't mean there ain't homework to be done.
[3:40:40] LeideGaming: remind me again about Garrisons and player housing difference?
[3:40:42] Scandeless: no one wants player housing lol
[3:40:43] N3llee: did you give your thoughts on the RWF and the ending?
[3:40:49] Syllvn: As long as they don't make player housing tied to gear progression we good. WoW loves to tie in fun side content into the gear grind.
[3:40:50] CloosterFlook: nobody talks about archeage housing enough and i feel like ppl could learn a lot from xl games mistakes
[3:41:18] Lavani: @CrimsonNurse thats perfect, game should have casual solo content. Not everything has to be raid/dungeon group only stuff.
[3:41:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Beezy403 Beezy typically player house is individual instanced houses for players to put decorations in and hang out. Garrisons were a kind of attempt
[3:41:34] Scarhearth: archeage housing was great but p2w and hack to win...
[3:41:46] CloosterFlook: archeage housing was NOT great LUL
[3:42:02] omaahm96: @91niki I have my masters thesis to write actually🤔
[3:42:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: ESO has some cool player housing, you can put crafting stations into them, but it's not something people use a lot
[3:42:08] Tiger2hunt: sometimes you just gotta recycle... for the planet you know kek
[3:42:15] CloosterFlook: different server cluster for housing and in pvp zones fps would drop down to 30 NANI
[3:42:18] Scarhearth: yes it was lol. You could make a fuck ton of money with housing on AA
[3:42:29] 91Niki: @omaahm96 Maybe do that instead mate

[3:43:13] zuru35: No reason why wow shouldnt have player housing for next xpac, all other mmos have them. It’s been a long requested feature for awhile now
[3:43:18] omaahm96: @91niki wanted towel to laugh why so serious ? 🥲
[3:43:33] Zansteh: cant wait for that timer to hit 0
[3:43:37] MrGattz: @omaahm96 shes just a party pooper dont mind her
[3:43:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked the class halls in Legion, if they can do those for guilds it could be cool
[3:44:11] Jindo_ZG: I want guild housing and more guild achievements with guild rewards
[3:44:28] mmo_kenna_: God damn this RWF was amazing, it had it all. And porbs to Blizzard being able to create these bosses that pushed these guilds to their limit
[3:45:05] Etrissa: why have dps when weapons
[3:45:11] CrimsonNurse: I think with faction lines getting blurred I think guilds will be less important soon, maybe I will be wrong
[3:45:28] 91Niki: @omaahm96 It's called having humor Kappa
[3:45:36] CloosterFlook: @Jindo_ZG i just want guild levels and perks like every other mmo has well most of them which makes it fun to be in a guild
[3:45:43] Jarlan23: i thought they were gonna do a full on faction merger in 10.0 or something
[3:45:45] taolos: player housing is a boring feature imo
[3:45:49] Jarlan23: or they were gonna expand on it after 9.5
[3:45:53] Jindo_ZG: They should make guilds cross faction and more important to gameplay
[3:46:05] CritcobainTV: Why use many word when few word do trick?
[3:46:07] mcbone4: You excited to be playing. Pally as a main again?

[3:46:22] akia03: player housing will be huge on rp realms
[3:46:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Crafting furniture in ESO is cool and a player can make a lot of gold doing it
[3:46:41] CrimsonNurse: If they make them cross faction that would be big for guilds again. Currently I feel guilds are less important
[3:46:44] Dogjah: ESO has amazing player housing
[3:46:56] bigjuicystan: wow's engine would have to change becuase i dont htink player housing would work with how wow looks
[3:47:07] mmo_kenna_: +1 for ESO it does player housing right
[3:47:12] Kisswani: good

[3:47:24] Kisswani: test now , have a refined version on expansion launch
[3:47:25] CloosterFlook: havent played WoW since...idk since launch should i get back into it XD
[3:47:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cross-faction stuff is probably the most important, I think
[3:47:49] Keyastaron_: PF 14 ? Kappa
[3:47:50] Jindo_ZG: guild housing would be more server efficient, I think its more likely than individual housing
[3:47:51] CrimsonNurse: Could there be a big engine upgrade for 10.0?
[3:48:01] Sarocus: Seems to me that since Blizz decided to not let the bros call the shots anymore, they are bringing up all the ideas they couldnt before
[3:48:08] cozyzequel: @Towelliee how did you upgrade your 265 to 291?
[3:48:13] thomaspxo: just go to ZM for conduit soulbind .faster than flying
[3:48:16] mmo_kenna_: The fact that every WoW player has a list of 10+ things to change in the game speaks alot
[3:48:21] akia03: @Jindo_ZG wont every one just make a 1 person guild for it?
[3:48:46] ReynaMarxx: ReynaMarxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[3:48:50] Keyastaron_: @CrimsonNurse  THEY ARE getting rid of android system 32 devices and turning to 64 bit devices
[3:49:11] itsjustcjk: ya i dusted all  that shit
[3:49:11] Lavani: oh god, no runes pls.
[3:49:11] pereadin: Do you think 10.0 brings a new hero class, race and talent row or one or the other?
[3:49:22] mmo_kenna_: What about people who didnt do SOD can we jump in?
[3:49:36] Gotxiko: so synced content
[3:49:41] Vahs_Redclaw: @pereadin tbh i think not
[3:49:56] iforceftw: so gear doesnt work in raid? what do u need gears for?
[3:50:04] iforceftw: m+ mini game?
[3:50:07] Lavani: synced? didnt the post say it was going to drop higher ilvl loot?
[3:50:14] akia03: @pereadin are there classes that they could add that wow doesnt already have?
[3:50:34] dracullus: after ~7 months of this tier SoD may be more popular, of course most popular will be Nathria
[3:50:34] Kheonik: @iforceftw for everything else?
[3:50:35] CrimsonNurse: @keyastaron_ I would like to see major changes to the game, really freshen things up with 10.0. Make the game close to brand new. It would be a big risk with a possible be reward.

[3:50:49] iforceftw: whats everything else?
[3:50:52] Gotxiko: my guess is that this will be 10.0 feature, with 10.0 raidhaving this synced mode in 10.0.5, 10.0 and 10.1 both syncd in 10.1.5 and so on

[3:52:06] mmo_kenna_: 9.2 LFR has been nice so far
[3:52:09] dracullus: could be just all 4 difficulties with item level increasing 26 compared to season 3
[3:52:20] pereadin: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! you blasted with your DK the last key we did on him.  So smooth
[3:52:23] pereadin: That was tyran though
[3:52:41] N3llee: BT raiding isnt que-ablle
[3:52:45] magemaster225: not confirmed just how I think it would be queable

[3:53:01] Chronine: timewalking raids arent queable...
[3:53:02] dracullus: what about shards and tier gear though xD
[3:53:15] mmo_kenna_: @Chronine they should be

[3:54:08] miguelapple: individual boss "keys" would be interesting
[3:54:08] Gotxiko: will we need shards gear for sanctum lol
[3:54:12] CritcobainTV: i think all difficulties will have the same affixes, just savling hp and dmg like they do now
[3:54:18] CritcobainTV: is what it sounds like
[3:54:19] Wcvechten: Tyrannical Sludgefist let's go
[3:54:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: They'll need a different key system for raids, I think
[3:54:20] KawaXIV: so they're trying to make like shadowlands raids greatest hits or something? presumably a selection of the best bosses of each put into a separated boss rush raid or something? am I getting the right idea? I don't play WoW, is there historical precedent for that?
[3:54:26] CrimsonNurse: I wish Mythic was doable with 10 players
[3:54:45] Kisswani: If it's a key system , couldn't tht just replace the difficulties we have now ? just have one base raid and then add affixes to them ?
[3:55:07] Zerfell: could be a boss rush
[3:55:18] ItsToxicQT: did you do your DH? @towelliee
[3:55:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess the retooled raids would be normal mode? Without crazy mythic mechanics?
[3:55:35] ItsToxicQT: lol
[3:55:37] CritcobainTV: 198? Perfect

[3:57:14] Scarhearth: blood dk works bettwer with necro
[3:57:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: If the uptime on Death and Decay was 100%, then Death's Due would be good...but it's a pain in the ass
[3:57:57] mmrghost7: necro makes add management way better
[3:58:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: For Blood DK you pretty much anything but Night Fae, imo
[3:59:11] Jelanipatron: perfect time to do an all tank raid with twilight dev huh lol
[3:59:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: They did buff the hell out of Necro's grabby hands for DK
[3:59:29] mmrghost7: Bdk with double leggo and venthyr , plus bonestorm , u can do some hefty burst

[4:09:52] mmrghost7: u summon him and explode him if u need the burst of heal
[4:09:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: The ghoul for Blood DK adds a little damage or you can blow them up for a heal
[4:09:58] Scarhearth: pet is basically an extra dot and heal
[4:10:05] N3llee: macro the pet to a ability
[4:10:15] Zander_TheGamer: There's probably a WeakAura for that :p
[4:10:45] Nokterian: mistakes where made LUL
[4:11:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say that with 4 piece and CRW they do crazy amount of damage with dancing rune weapon, so the ghoul is not important
[4:11:14] remitis: anyone in chat know about how long punika takes?

[4:17:07] Jindo_ZG: @Towelliee what new allied races would you add if you could next expansion

[4:18:04] Laluzmia: Are they going to finsh theraid some time this week?
[4:18:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the thing with Blood DK is that healers can't just watch health, they have to watch runic power too
[4:18:09] brootalbemo: brootalbemo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Over the hill dude!
[4:18:12] Syprus1: is the wow announcement on a fri?

[4:18:41] Mitteennss: its ona tuesday
[4:18:46] Syprus1: thanks
[4:18:50] Shrenko: what is 9 to 5 challenge?
[4:18:56] kingzeussy: whats the 9-5 challenge?
[4:19:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: If a Blood DK drops in health, they are still okay if they have runic power to death strike back
[4:19:11] smashwow: queue the dolly parton music
[4:19:26] Cody_Cayde: @Towelliee you ever give LOTRO a try?
[4:19:30] KawaXIV: one of the things i often hear wow players complain about is like the burden of keeping up vs. falling behind. Does this mean likewise that it'd be a long endeavor to pick up the game at any point other than the start of an expansion cycle and become raid ready? like if someone started today, how soon could they be raiding current content with a clear path to higher difficulties?

[4:20:21] valarat95: @kawaxiv if u know what ur doing can catch up in a week easy
[4:20:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, the amount of time drops a lot of if you have a mentor to walk you through it
[4:20:53] KawaXIV: @valarat95 i know relatively little about the game or it's progression systems
[4:20:56] Frontwon: i skipped last patch and was able to catch up to raid in a week
[4:20:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kawa it could be just a couple of weeks if you have help
[4:21:21] KawaXIV: i have no help, i dont really know any wow players
[4:21:40] ItsToxicQT: that's what guilds are for @kawaxiv
[4:21:44] valarat95: @KawaXIV then its like any other game ud have to learn it all but there is plenty of content to teach u on youtube
[4:21:47] Shrenko: so.... like survival hunter?
[4:21:54] Kheonik: bonedust brew proccing I think
[4:21:58] KawaXIV: im an experienced ffxiv raider regularly clearing savage with decent parses and have a couple ultimates down too, I watched the last two wow races and I think trying out the game for raiding seems like an interesting idea
[4:21:59] Scarhearth: WW single target is just dogwater
[4:22:00] AtomJar: there not talking about actually help. more like somone pointing you to what you should do there are loads of youtube vids on that stuff
[4:22:03] lithium364: probably because if the still existing bugs
[4:22:05] fluh_: as long as the spinning crane talent is in the game that dps will be like that always
[4:22:19] KawaXIV: ok so if i do it, knowledge is power so i can be efficient basically
[4:22:25] Shrenko: Im so happy survival is in a good decent spot now. It is so much fun to play compared to BM and MM

[4:23:43] AtomJar: i would add that if you have never played wow before dont rush to the hard stuff. get use to the game doing normals / HC
[4:24:47] KawaXIV: @AtomJar is hc heroic? yeah following the intended difficulty ladder seems reasonable of course
[4:24:49] Jarlan23: whoa
[4:24:54] K0rzak0v: we wiped 3 times on stitchflesh the first week in season 3 on a +15. was so hard to get him down on tyrannical. should have used all the spears lol
[4:25:03] The_Metal_Man: Sad thing was there was no leavers :( just rushed the pugs and took some azralon folks i shouldnt have

[4:26:00] Shrenko: yep 400 valor is 1 upgrade
[4:26:11] PToastman: does those weird stats like speed and avoidance actually provide any real value? honest question

[4:26:17] pixxelina: LUL
[4:26:21] Syprus1: that chest is for sure goning into the tier creator
[4:26:23] AtomJar: @AtomJar yeah HC is heroic, also give M+ a try and pvp etc. there is alot to do in wow end game if you enjoy it all. most people stick to one type of content and get burnt out on it that way
[4:26:43] The_Metal_Man: @warrenny its partiaally my fault, that was on my dk whose only like 248 or somethin
[4:26:43] pereadin: I got you bro
[4:26:49] pereadin: EZ PZ

[4:26:57] KawaXIV: @AtomJar ngl im not interested in pvp and dubious of M+ lol. how much non-raiding content is involved in getting geared and prepped for raid?
[4:26:59] goviralgavin: most deff
[4:27:01] smashwow: all the damage
[4:27:02] The_Metal_Man: you do nothing outside of incarn tho
[4:27:13] Recruitie: no tier=dead on my screen

[4:28:04] AtomJar: @AtomJar you can just do the new zone's quests and kill the rares there for gear then go into normal raid easily. wouldnt take more then a week to do that.
[4:28:17] warrenny: Funny thing is get past him and its a piss easy dungeon
[4:28:46] pereadin: someone get a 15 wake ready for his druid
[4:28:55] KawaXIV: @AtomJar and are normal rewards on their own a gear path into being heroic ready and then heroic a gear path into being mythic ready and is doing other modes of play just an augment / boost to pace on that?
[4:29:00] pereadin: I'll be lurking till then
[4:29:01] mrniceguy817: Did a 15 with one of liquids bears he pulled 17k overall

[4:29:45] warrenny: @mrniceguy817 So wierd reading liquid when it used to be limit
[4:30:00] warrenny: Tbf not watched gwitch much recently
[4:30:54] AtomJar: @AtomJar yeah basically. tho learning your class and rotation can make up for lack of gear in some areas. most people get very high ilvl but get beat on dps by somone that just knows how to play
[4:31:08] KawaXIV: yeah of course that's a given
[4:31:21] KawaXIV: press your buttons and in the right order 4Head
[4:31:27] AtomJar: it wasnt always :P
[4:31:31] KawaXIV: ok good info thank you AtomJar / others who answered my questions
[4:32:18] KawaXIV: my impression as an outside observer has always been that wow had a lot of side systems and stuff that had to be grinded / kept up with in order to stay on progression but the answers im getting suggest otherwise

[4:34:42] KawaXIV: i mean im not even that far along yet i'm only just considering it
[4:34:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Also like AtomJar was saying, learning the proper rotations is huge
[4:35:19] KawaXIV: i haven't even thought about like what job to play or if i'm really gonna do it, just people say that wow's raids are really good and i'm a fan of raiding in mmos and the world races and stuff are fun to watch so idk, i wanna try
[4:36:41] KawaXIV: its just hard to evaluate if i can be ambitious about progression and climbing difficulty with side-game hours, since I'm not looking for a replacement for my main game
[4:36:54] slavclutch: whats the countdown for?
[4:37:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can jump into WoW and have fun and learn the stuff more slowly, just keep in mind that the min-max stuff gets hardcore in the better endgame content
[4:37:29] warrenny: @slavclutch Expac announce maybe?
[4:37:39] KawaXIV: @weirdo_dude like have to give it my life and soul, every waking moment level of hardcore?

[4:40:39] KawaXIV: the adjustment mechanism of my headphones snags my hair if I let it grow too long. not ear hair, head hair
[4:40:41] nightmayor12: Fungus dandruff all kinds of shit
[4:40:41] Buckwink: I keep snacks for raid in there
[4:40:46] 91Niki: If you think keyboards are gross, you've seen nothing KEKW
[4:40:47] flebbooo: i dare not KEKW
[4:41:07] 1s2real: I have a cosair headset . My ex girlfriend got it for me and I use them almost everyday
[4:41:11] KawaXIV: @Tokies like an in-ear monitor? those don't actually sound great, they just sound clear so you can hear yourself on stage

[4:42:15] lithium364: wait till tuesday when the sylvanas story campaign unlocks MonkaS

[4:44:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: The money always matters, but to a degree
[4:44:58] Relic7: Harder raids surely means it takes longer to down bosses and therefore longer raids?
[4:44:58] Colt_Engineer: the token makes a sht ton of money
[4:45:01] grapyz: I mean if you bought a wow token for any type of gear or boost, I mean.....
[4:45:04] Coriollis: 100k in wowtokens was spent on each side
[4:45:10] 1s2real: Lmaoo !!! Guy there an org . You need money to operate a org
[4:45:16] AureliusXV: ads KEKW
[4:45:29] theDirtyon3: Max splits revenue with the guildies during RWF
[4:45:46] AureliusXV: reality
[4:45:49] WSquiggle12: WSquiggle12 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! towHi
[4:45:49] Tainted_Meats: Cant you pay for a token. Then use gold to buy gear and carry? then pvp with said gear?
[4:45:51] Tokies: so in RMT world first cost $92k
[4:45:52] jimpah: tbf, streams, ads, donations, sponsors. It shouldnt be a problem to get 100k$
[4:45:55] Coriollis: mods deleted
[4:45:57] fluh_: i believe max has said he makes more money from ads nowadays than from subs
[4:45:59] tylive52: @Towelliee if 10.0 flops is wow done?
[4:46:06] thiccsushi: @Towelliee There was a megathread since the start mods probably removed it
[4:46:10] Tuppe: LUL
[4:46:22] Samaellus: Wat that Sloot?
[4:46:23] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @DaltonIRL (warning)
[4:46:26] nielefs: Why people are so toxic
[4:46:30] Coriollis: maybe mods are sour liquid fanboys Kappa
[4:46:31] The_Metal_Man: might have been on r/competitivewow
[4:46:32] Samaellus: *whas
[4:46:40] keyalis: Imagine playing WoW instead of Elden Ring. Smh
[4:46:44] PToastman: I am buying the whole Primus = real mastermind theory, the jailors machine corpse had domination runes on it. didnt put them there himnself
[4:46:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: ouch lol
[4:47:13] KawaXIV: @tylive52 i think market wise it doesn't really make any sense that a wow death would be anything but a sloooow decline. I don't think there will ever be a singular point of failure nor a single blow up moment
[4:47:30] KawaXIV: unless civilization suddenly ends, then wow is dead LUL
[4:47:31] crittinkitten: agree 100%
[4:47:38] Zippaya: yup
[4:47:39] Colt_Engineer: seeing the end in sight is a major morale booster
[4:47:40] Shrenko: they just took a scoop of Gfuel #ad
[4:47:40] Maego1: "Gingi Juice" difference Kappa
[4:47:42] Bwyllin_: back to back 10%s aswell
[4:47:42] DaltonIRL: Scrype said if they were in Liquid's position they also would have called it quits for mental being that far behind
[4:47:44] Buckwink: Echo are all animals
[4:47:48] N3llee: Liquid had players doing the pvp arena and shit
[4:47:53] quadhre: !wow10

[4:47:54] Coriollis: gingi juice finaly kicked in
[4:47:54] TheBenXO: Adrenaline is a hellova drug
[4:47:55] theDirtyon3: Liquid had sooo much going on behind the scenes too dont forget that
[4:48:02] Zippaya: Scype said they would do the same thing if they was behind

[4:48:05] RustproofSage: thats why they called early the night before
[4:48:07] itsyoboywill: Liquid was tired and were dinking around on stream
[4:48:07] cazhually: if the race would've been shorter. would liquid have won?
[4:48:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Definitely a hardcore race
[4:48:31] nightmayor12: EU= Exectuion Unit
[4:48:34] 91Niki: @Towelliee I'm gonna need you to stop playing wow. You're giving Gattz the wow itch Kappa
[4:48:42] Coriollis: Rygelon was very different US from EU thou like , both guilds are the BEST for a reason
[4:48:50] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[4:48:51] theDirtyon3: Yeah but they lost like 3 players for days at a time during the race too
[4:48:53] KawaXIV: huh? echo's facility was pretty nice I thought
[4:48:53] Kisswani: KEKW
[4:49:02] theDirtyon3: Blizz needs to not schedule stuff together
[4:49:15] smashwow: don't knock broncos those cigs got me through college lol
[4:49:25] Levaress: Why do they try so hard to get world first anyways?
[4:49:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the reset thing wasn't a real factor
[4:50:09] brewgamingtv: The amount of splits this race was unhealthy
[4:50:09] griffdog125: @SophiaHearts money and sponsors
[4:50:18] theDirtyon3: yeah the liquid facility is gonna be crazy nice
[4:50:19] KawaXIV: @SophiaHearts for the sake of competition of course! but also now that it's propped up by sponsorships and streaming revenue there's also, yknow, extra incentive to do it, not that I think that's why any player does it primarily
[4:50:19] Aidler: Nobody expected and was prepared for the race to take this long… bottom line
[4:50:20] crittinkitten: @SophiaHearts fun and competition
[4:50:24] tommysavagex: EU is used to startimg from behind
[4:50:25] Coriollis: 186 splits MY LORD
[4:50:25] mizerboy: how many times has NA won RWF?
[4:50:28] cazhually: i think half their roster will be changed with EU players
[4:50:31] theDirtyon3: I heard the liquid food wasnt very good this time
[4:50:32] Sollice: I was so surprised Loiquid went to Patriots studio
[4:50:35] ijuki: 10 mythic POGGERS ?
[4:50:37] Sollice: That came from left field lol
[4:50:40] ijuki: 10 man*
[4:50:46] PToastman: comswaps? danSgame
[4:50:56] MrRoguery: Do you think they might prepare for a longer race next time due ot the adverse effects of this race?
[4:50:57] griffdog125: you can only eat so much jersey mikes that bread put them to sleep
[4:51:02] Kisswani: One thing I learned for sure this tier : Imfiredup is probably the best mage in the world
[4:51:07] ashwing_: Max said it himself. They had 150 jailer pulls where they didnt progress a single bit
[4:51:19] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:51:22] cazhually: wonder why though he would go to that?
[4:51:24] ItsToxicQT: he never did want to be the face he wants his raiders to be
[4:51:28] theDirtyon3: @Kisswani thats been known but yea
[4:51:32] Zippaya: Sloot had a good point, 10hrs of prog as a rule
[4:51:43] koreanmissile: Look at how many people Liquid lost due to the shear length of the race and had to reprog with new players vs echo who lost few ppl
[4:51:53] zackmcquack: liquids casting team was fun to watch.
[4:52:01] Kisswani: @theDirtyon3 I never really saw his PoV before , that movement was ridiculous
[4:52:09] grapyz: wype at 1%, oh its been 10hr boys
[4:52:14] iknowido: 10 hrs and race laste 5 weeks lol
[4:52:20] Thunderbrew: This is why Blizzard should be involved to enforce rules, like MLB or NFL
[4:52:20] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[4:52:22] Kisswani: That would kill love events tho
[4:52:22] Sollice: That would drive everyone nuts
[4:52:22] Coriollis: @comrademcgato echo memes were also top kek
[4:52:25] Mahal_11532: that was the birth of mandatory alts
[4:52:28] GamesPlayedByJay: You think Max and Simone Biles should do a commercial together?
[4:52:30] gali5656: that'd me raiders making 10 alts
[4:52:32] Kisswani: Live *
[4:52:34] dright424: They would have an "alt" raid to attempt the boss and learn it
[4:52:36] The_Metal_Man: only problem is the race goes even longer than, and you just have people testing stuff on alts like lich king
[4:52:37] MrRoguery: That would do it, it be so boring to watch!
[4:52:38] nightmayor12: Blizzard doesnt need to cater this game around 100 players. fuck that
[4:52:38] N3llee: All that did was make people have multiple toons to get more attempts in
[4:52:39] theDirtyon3: @Kisswani you should look up him on the first Xymox boss in Nathria he had a CRAZY three bomb pull that people were going crazy for
[4:52:46] brewgamingtv: I'd like to see blizz go away from personal loot lol
[4:52:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, alts
[4:53:10] Shrenko: but it took months to kill a boss in classic BabyRage
[4:53:26] Kelticlore: when do WOW Players ever get along
[4:53:29] GamesPlayedByJay: Truth - leaders have to make hard choices
[4:53:50] Relic7: That's the whole point of Mythic
[4:53:50] Bennodkk: Gingi was benched for last two bosses
[4:53:53] Bennodkk: that was smth new
[4:53:53] KawaXIV: Echo legit seems like a really healthy team in terms of how the players interact with and treat each other and respect decisions and stuff ngl
[4:53:56] Relic7: And those Mythic bosses get nerfed throughout
[4:53:58] cazhually: imagine if echo rekills jailer before liquid?
[4:53:59] smashwow: should they though?
[4:54:04] Sollice: I love the comments when people say Liquid gave up.....Yes 16 hours a day for 30 days straight with thousands of people watching them with a lot of mental stress
[4:54:04] smashwow: that's the real question
[4:54:12] thunder993: and they nerf it after for everyone else
[4:54:19] Peqdevil: I would assume they got benched for reason like the  correct class, gear, spec not all players have every one
[4:54:23] 91Niki: @Sollice This
[4:54:32] Kisswani: I agree with something Lore said , always better to overtune and then nerf , than have an Emerald Nightmare scenario
[4:54:41] GamesPlayedByJay: @Sollice are you saying Liquid would have left if they were still in the lead?  I think not.  Mental health is an excuse.
[4:54:52] OvenMonkeyGaming: sounds like blizzard just needs to QA there own stuff
[4:54:55] Tylerjorden: !wow10
[4:54:55] Moobot: @Tylerjorden World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion announcement date 4/19 and other exciting dates like WoW Mobile - Check it out! https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1500894944474501120?s=20&t=PgfuLeF2nRsESPGtuvNnbw
[4:54:55] OvenMonkeyGaming: like ffxiv
[4:55:01] theDirtyon3: @GamesPlayedByJay fuck outta here man
[4:55:03] Sollice: @GamesPlayedByJay You clearly have never worked on anything other than a normal 9-5
[4:55:04] mmo_kenna_: This was the best RWF, it really had it all. The difficulty of the bosses was insane
[4:55:20] smashwow: so here's what i mean. should the raid be tuned to prolong the RWF by X days? i think the hotfixing is fine. but i question if making it hard for the sake of WFR is the right play with all the issues.
[4:55:23] thunder993: No dev team has player skill of limit and echo
[4:55:30] dright424: Do you think they should bring back something like the 30% buff ICC for post rwf?
[4:55:47] Zippaya: well, Liquid and Echo definitly put the race on the other level
[4:55:51] Sollice: @GamesPlayedByJay besides..if they were in the lead it would be dead and this wouldn't be an issue.
[4:55:55] Kisswani: Yeah , they dont have to worry about tier / splits / trinkets / talents etc ...
[4:56:00] Coriollis: @thunder993 Halondrus begs to differ, evan Max aknowledged it
[4:56:00] briciod: what's the fastest way to earn renown as a player that hasn't played since 9.1 launch?
[4:56:06] Relic7: No they shouldn't, it
[4:56:09] Relic7: it's an e-sport
[4:56:13] KawaXIV: yeah thing about ffxiv is like, our classes don't have multiple specs, our gear does not have unique effects on it, they're just stat items, and we don't have trinkets or anything. less moving parts and less unpredictable shit players could do. and yeah 4 bosses at a time. It's a lot easier to test internally and have tight tuning.
[4:56:15] thiccsushi: I don't think we will see a race this long again
[4:56:16] GamesPlayedByJay: @Sollice You have more excuses than Max
[4:56:24] theDirtyon3: this guy
[4:56:27] nightmayor12: They tuned it around double leggos and 4pc without a doubt
[4:56:31] JiberishUI: I thought you said you were using Naowh's UI now?!
[4:56:32] KawaXIV: on the other hand, it does seem like blizzard could go even halfway into internal QA and still get better results albeit not perfect
[4:56:36] Sollice: @GamesPlayedByJay Sure i do. Again I maintain if you work at all, it's not more than a 9-5 job so you have no clue lol
[4:56:38] stoke: nopw
[4:56:44] Peqdevil: Guilds should be prepard for anything
[4:56:48] jaalexba: box of chocolate
[4:56:51] Kisswani: @KawaXIV basically yeah , test stuff with pentamelded crafted gear and you're set for the most part
[4:56:54] thunder993: its hard to assume tuning in advance
[4:56:56] smashwow: they also said they wouldn't tune around 2x leggo, but it's clear they did
[4:56:57] zackmcquack: do you think holondrus was overturned or over mechanical and that is the biggest delay of the race?
[4:56:58] ribose1982: Why not have race on same server for NA and EU, all given all gear they need and then its just on player skill and team work?
[4:57:04] theDirtyon3: @GamesPlayedByJay why on people? We just having a conversation about the RWF no one cares about your opinion
[4:57:08] TheRealAxiom: If they did not prepare for possible 4 set and double lego then thats on them...
[4:57:15] Relic7: I loved Halondrus
[4:57:18] tommysavagex: @Towelliee  do you think a tournament realm would help? Would eliminate splits
[4:57:19] Coriollis: idk, world first barrier is already high, almost impossible for average guild, so no I wouldn't be for Blizz to tip em how the raid will be
[4:57:19] KawaXIV: @Kisswani i also forgot to mention the role structure of our parties is really static too where wow can shuffle number of players per role and stuff too
[4:57:28] GamesPlayedByJay: Yea, you would need a union.
[4:57:28] iknowido: think method gets 2nd place?
[4:57:41] 91Niki: @GamesPlayedByJay Not to mention, it's a race, it's a constant hyper focus. Working 16 hours a day. No time off. Constantly on a live stream. No private time besides when sleeping. Saying mental health is an excuse is just plain stupidity
[4:57:46] mmo_kenna_: Best team won all I hear is crying right now
[4:57:59] swervity82: or just tune it how you tune it... then if they reach a point where they can't kill a boss then i might take weeks to get gear to kill a boss.
[4:58:02] cazhually: cant wait for the mdi where echo will win outright and theres no real competition
[4:58:06] Kelticlore: its blizzards game there for its in Blizzards control
[4:58:06] GamesPlayedByJay: They knew what they were signing up for guys
[4:58:08] GamesPlayedByJay: get real.
[4:58:10] Sollice: @mmo_kenna_ ? WHo is crying?
[4:58:15] AureliusXV: thes guys do this on a regualr basis anyways they stream 10-12 hours daily, maybe not to this extreme but they do this shit all day
[4:58:15] GamesPlayedByJay: They lost so they quit.
[4:58:18] dwillyjpox: Not a fan of max throwing in the towel 15 minutes before he would have lost
[4:58:21] neek123: Race to world first live :p
[4:58:23] CrunkyBrewster: Unless Blizzard is paying you for raiding, yeah they should not have control
[4:58:24] Sollice: Some shitty takes out here lol
[4:58:29] tommysavagex: @Towelliee  I mean, liquid and echo will get the gear either way
[4:58:29] stoke: "slowly worked for their gear" Kappa
[4:58:30] Sollice: No one said Echo wasn't better.
[4:58:31] Hybridwarhawk: Nobody is crying, adults are having an actual discussion about it
[4:58:32] Zinx93: this raid tier is extremely fun, i think blizzard should always aim to tune raids like this. then everyone can know what to expect
[4:58:35] stoke: "we buyin t-sets boooiiiis"
[4:58:38] thymos_: @GamesPlayedByJay victory or quit
[4:58:38] VoldoxTV: weird situation, i think its great the race lasted longer, personally think it made for much better viewing. great to see content lasting longer rather than done in 1 reset. but i guess if this was blizzards new staple for the length of raids then "guilds" can prepare for it next time accordingly
[4:58:53] relios898: Also how would you determine who should be invited to the tournament realm and who shouldn't is to me the biggest problem
[4:58:55] Kisswani: The only way I see blizzard controlling play time is if they actually own the venue where the raiders are doing the live events
[4:59:00] cazhually: it wasn't better viewing
[4:59:09] jaalexba: did JPC get his four piece?
[4:59:09] cazhually: yep
[4:59:13] cazhually: super low views
[4:59:16] Darkwield: is it a good time to return to wow ?
[4:59:17] Buckwink: thats the shadowlands effect
[4:59:19] paulson14: should be 2 weeks top
[4:59:21] Sabrevath: !wow10
[4:59:21] thiccsushi: It sucked to view at the start with all the splits
[4:59:21] Moobot: @Sabrevath World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion announcement date 4/19 and other exciting dates like WoW Mobile - Check it out! https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1500894944474501120?s=20&t=PgfuLeF2nRsESPGtuvNnbw
[4:59:21] KawaXIV: i think one of the most important points to consider is that nobody expected it to take that long, and at some point that takes a toll. preparation might have been different if they expected the possibility of 18 days
[4:59:25] ribose1982: I think its because ppl are just not interesed into WRF as much any more
[4:59:25] Shrenko: thats because people are done with Shadowlands I guess
[4:59:28] N3llee: I was curious what the numbers were
[4:59:31] N3llee: so it was lower?
[4:59:32] Coriollis: sup low viewes average, yes cuz it lasted sooo long
[4:59:35] thunder993: 140k on echo kill
[4:59:43] monute316: but thats the game not the race
[4:59:46] OvenMonkeyGaming: people are done with viewing wow in general i think not just shadowlands
[4:59:47] Theduskflyer: RWF had lower viewrship this year, i think becuse of the splits.
[4:59:47] jridablo: because WOW already down in views to begin with
[4:59:47] Buckwink: a lot of people have already moved on to 10.0
[4:59:55] Thdlock: everyone saw us doing splits first 2 days and just waited for the end dont blame em
[4:59:59] Jokervenom1978: Sorry i just got here. Did Liquid win?
[4:59:59] dwillyjpox: Had to cost big $ for helix complex and hotel for a month plus food…
[5:00:00] Zander_TheGamer: Not sure you can say that. So many more of the players are streaming so it is just so spread out @Towelliee
[5:00:01] thunder993: 40k on each stream is not low+individual streams
[5:00:03] VoldoxTV: is that because of the current state of the game though. who knows
[5:00:04] brewgamingtv: yeah 500 splits this race just not healthy at all
[5:00:16] tommysavagex: @Towelliee  is it just because shadowlands is in the slumps?
[5:00:16] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[5:00:42] Theduskflyer: But twitch overall has lower viewer count over the whole site no?
[5:01:04] flebbooo: KEKW
[5:01:08] Zippaya: 20k+ -
[5:01:08] MrRoguery: Is there anyway to make splits less viable?
[5:01:16] slumbilly808: it would make sense to me to just add up all the pulls total to clear the raid and the least pulls is the best
[5:01:22] Moonphire: Moonphire subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 81 months! hammer's up baby
[5:01:31] razma_: lets make a lost ark system ! !! gamba !
[5:01:32] razma_: lets go
[5:01:32] valarat95: masterloot
[5:01:36] neek123: masterlooter might make splits be done quicker, so they dont need to do as many splits?
[5:01:36] Coriollis: max gear /char/week aquisition
[5:01:38] Kelticlore: doesnt anyone really count asmon as a reall streamer
[5:01:39] razma_: KEKW
[5:01:48] cazhually: what do you think are the lessons blizzard would take away from this? like not what we viewers want but blizz in general

[5:01:59] thunder993: this race had more viewers than sanctum for sure
[5:01:59] MrRoguery: Masterloot would just amke splits more efficient no?
[5:02:01] Sylnus: If splits didnt exist wouldnt the race go on even longer unless they made difficulty easier?
[5:02:06] thiccsushi: Doesn't china get currency for killing bosses to buy gear?
[5:02:21] indigooo: Do you know what coul be great, every new patch, for example ZM, the gear you get from quests/dailies, it's not 232/239, it's 252, straight, that will help the player base sooooooooooo much, because right know, if you dont have 265+ 2set pieces, you are already out of any normal raid
[5:02:22] cazhually: what if blizz did smaller raids
[5:02:24] SilkeySmooth: maybe wow should add honing people are ok with it in lost ark
[5:02:34] Coriollis: KJ was bugged for a week ?
[5:02:59] KawaXIV: @SilkeySmooth i basically quit lost ark over honing

[5:03:49] KawaXIV: did it?

[5:04:03] KawaXIV: @ArcaneSyntax can you explain your reasoning?

[5:04:28] indigooo: imagine the level of stress doing 700+ in jailer
[5:04:37] Buckwink: the clown music was perfect lol
[5:05:00] Deekan33: Deekan33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 59 months! 
[5:05:03] KawaXIV: @ArcaneSyntax why is that inherently a problem?
[5:05:11] Kisswani: I saw some people ask for a dev sit down to talk about this tier . I would love to see that
[5:05:24] ArcaneSyntax: @ArcaneSyntax because it's not healthy for people attempting.
[5:06:07] lmtheboogie: why do people want them to develop games for a very small group of people
[5:06:10] 91Niki: It's the constant strain without time to breathe. That's gonna kick you not only physically, but also mentally.
[5:06:14] KawaXIV: @ArcaneSyntax isn't a RWF a construct of the community's making? in a weird sort of way, I wanna say it's not blizzard's responsibility to ensure it's a certain length, it's not like they've gone out and said "okay here's the raid, now you MUST race to be the first to clear it" - isn't it more like "if yall wanna do that be my guest but whatever lol"
[5:06:19] jridablo: the last tier should be harder so i dont see why not
[5:06:24] thunder993: its hard to predict the length in advance by blizzard though, unless its pure dps checks though @towelliee
[5:06:33] TheGiant99: They choose to play that many hours...
[5:06:38] brucezhu: brucezhu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:07:07] lmtheboogie: it's for them but do they really have to cater to a race and how long it will take
[5:07:32] Levaress: PLEASE remove LFR and mythic+'s
[5:07:34] lithium364: or lfr is actually harder, member lfr nzoth i member, people without cloak
[5:07:37] Biotechz: they also weren't allowed to raid test the last 3 which I think attributed to the length of this race.
[5:07:37] ArcaneSyntax: @ArcaneSyntax I mean they absolutely design around it, they should just be aware of the toll it takes on the players.
[5:07:43] Coriollis: issue is lfr would be like LFR N'Zoth people would not want LFR gone idk
[5:07:45] Folgrum: content for 1 % affect other players, many classes are unbalanced cuz of few players in top guilds. its sux
[5:07:52] mmo_kenna_: great get rid of LFR and have nothing for guildless people to run
[5:07:56] RustproofSage: they would never tell
[5:08:00] KawaXIV: i think mmos need aspirational content, even if only a few people will ever touch it. it shouldn't be the entirety of development resources, but without that, it kind of feels like you're going nowhere, even if the alternative is going down a road you may never reach the end of
[5:08:04] dright424: It seemed like it was tuned around double legos
[5:08:06] KawaXIV: it's also a big spectacle and gives the game attention
[5:08:07] neek123: if crab was easier then itmight have been different
[5:08:08] jridablo: blame blizz again that the raid is a lil harder damn lol
[5:08:10] Calphurnious: @mmo_kenna_ Don't need a guild to do a normal
[5:08:17] Shrenko: imagine normal queable monkaS
[5:08:19] akacvrtops: Blizz won’t lol
[5:08:19] smashwow: i like it.
[5:08:21] Demented7: Advocating for a 5 - 8 day race isn't really a good take tho. I get that some bosses can be over tuned but after that race there's no other content for them
[5:08:25] Shrenko: LFR is allready a shitshow
[5:08:27] lithium364: yeah lfr--normal seems so washed nowadays in tuning
[5:08:31] smashwow: 4 levels of difficulty is dumb
[5:08:36] mmo_kenna_: yeah remember Asmon's normal raid?
[5:08:37] smashwow: has been since WoD
[5:08:41] ronpearlman: Managing expectations.
[5:08:50] akacvrtops: Lol asmons normal
[5:08:56] akacvrtops: You need coms now
[5:09:10] TheGiant99: There are Laws to how man hours a day your allowed to be made to work....If they choose to work past those times its on them. The Org should be monitoring that stuff
[5:09:24] smashwow: which forces the splits and everything else. splits are a direct response to the difficulty of a boss
[5:09:26] thunder993: you dont need coms for anything but rygelon normal, and addon solves that
[5:09:29] mmo_kenna_: fuck Comms I just want to login and play
[5:09:33] paulson14: yep, lfr, normal, heroic
[5:09:34] tommysavagex: casual semi-hardcore hardcore
[5:09:39] lithium364: yeah and just tune the raid more difficult by itself depending from first boss to last for heroic
[5:09:39] ArcaneSyntax: I think the average for a RWF should be 10-12 days.
[5:09:45] lmtheboogie: problem is everyone has a different opinion on how blizzard should make their game. whose right?
[5:09:47] thunder993: lords normal I mean
[5:09:48] KawaXIV: @smashwow i dont think 4 levels of difficulty is bad, i think the "ladder" of difficulty that players climb should have multiple steps, i just think a single piece of content having all 4 difficulties is weird. Give the raid two difficulties and use some other content to fill in rungs in the middle so that players who can't make a certain difficulty jump can do some learning in between or something
[5:09:53] MrRoguery: How many Mythic raiders are there?
[5:10:04] jridablo: yeah remove mythic, alot more player play LFR than mythiv kekw
[5:10:11] DaruyDT: thing is short raid usually fucks up EU cuz of not global release
[5:10:19] neek123: @MrRoguery in liquid / echo u mean or?
[5:10:23] KawaXIV: ngl im just advocating how XIV has normal, extreme, savage, and ultimate but no single content is all four of these, different fights fill different slots in this difficulty ladder, but i think it's healthier ngl
[5:10:28] Zawyer: of all the different type of guild/players, how would you split them? Because its for sure not 33/33/33% Normal/HC/Mythic
[5:10:29] grapyz: Just get rid of raids Kappa Cant complain if if its not in the game
[5:10:31] KawaXIV: wow i bookended that with ngl on both sides
[5:10:33] Coriollis: Halondrus disagrees, I bet they have an excellent QA raid team buuut, they don't see all bosses
[5:10:50] Buckwink: we may never get another raid like this because it was two raids smashed into one
[5:10:51] MrRoguery: I mean globally? Guilds that kill say 30-100% of mythic bosses?
[5:10:52] smashwow: @KawaXIV in theory i agree. in practice, it creates fatigue.
[5:10:56] Demented7: @ArcaneSyntax thats what im saying, if it was well done i mean thats apart of the race.. Us plebs can race for severs but outside of that ur asking for little cont and that seems weird
[5:11:01] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 Right. But it's a sport. A sport that is assumed to go X amount of days, as it used to. It's kinda like changing the rules in a soccer game without telling the players, making it last forever if it's a tie, expecting the players to keep going and run themselves into the ground.
[5:11:16] Thdlock: vigilant guardian was so funny that fight got nerfed 5 times or so before it was killed day 1 it was farming guilds
[5:11:25] snipsfan: yeah they did
[5:11:36] thiccsushi: @Thdlock Still a dog shit fight too KEKW
[5:11:38] Samaellus: yep, kudos to them
[5:11:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they did a pretty good job with the last 3 bosses, they were just tuned hard as hell
[5:11:43] mmo_kenna_: Ohh these poor players, get a grip guys they are competing at the highest level and need to go where no other will go to win
[5:11:43] thunder993: its pretty cool that rygelon and lords was killable without double lego
[5:11:51] TheGinjahNinja: TheGinjahNinja subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 76 months, currently on a 76 month streak! What a wild wild race. Grats Echo! Liquid gonna come back strong and get this next one!
[5:11:56] Zawyer: Echo applauded this tier overall. I dont know if they meant the tuning, the boss fights, the astetics or just all of it?
[5:11:58] TheGiant99: How muhc does Blizz actually benefitr from the RWF. If it isnt alot they should just not promote it
[5:12:26] MrRoguery: @TheGiant99 Massive publicity!

[5:12:30] thunder993: it's free marketing yeah
[5:12:34] Demented7: @91Niki I mean u were given time to prep for said event... Theres a huge pay out as they can only do this... ITs not that dramatic tbh
[5:12:41] KawaXIV: i just talked about wanting to try the game as a side game after watching RWFs so i'm an example right here
[5:12:41] lithium364: @Towelliee should they maybe go back to hardmode versions for heroic raiding?
[5:12:41] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[5:12:59] MrRoguery: Not to mention all the sponsors that get involved as well.
[5:13:02] WOOPsWOOP: look at these large organization signing these guilds
[5:13:08] Folgrum: game had peak sub numbers when was easier. all this RWF make game harder for rest 99% players
[5:13:09] neek123: @MrRoguery in SoD, there was 4.2k guilds that have 50%+ of the raid cleared, so thats at minimum 84k players
[5:13:13] giggz91: what are you main tanking this tier?
[5:13:23] 91Niki: @Demented7 They prepped for an event, expecting it to be similar to previous events. Turned out it lasted much much longer. So it's not being dramatic.
[5:13:24] thunder993: I wish blizzard did twitch drops too, helps promote the game
[5:13:35] darkdestroz: but sanctums gear looks better apperance wise ,
[5:13:42] mrelgaato: @thunder993 That!
[5:13:43] Demanisraar: Sactum was allright imo.. dunno
[5:13:46] Zawyer: but I understand they have to be careful not beeing too involved with the RWF community event. From a business perspective, things like the Method disaster occuring during RWF can even hurt Blizzard if it happens during an official event.
[5:13:55] Shrenko: I bet they will for 10.0
[5:14:01] Robodope: painsmith was a great fight
[5:14:04] Zawyer: if Blizzard were to be more involved, they would have to be way more in control of the guilds participating.
[5:14:05] alexxalexx1357: I think the mythic P4 was dumb all it was do more DMG no new mechanic or something cool
[5:14:08] Samaellus: @Shrenko nah
[5:14:10] thunder993: Hearthstone does it though
[5:14:26] Coriollis: HS has different audience thou
[5:14:28] 91Niki: @Demented7 Like I said, it's like prepping for a regular game of soccer, and the rules having changed without the players knowing it
[5:14:42] Thdlock: i give huge props to the guy that made halondrus because he also made painsmith and sludgefist that designer is so good
[5:14:45] Demented7: @91Niki Does that excuse make sens to you for real though ? " We thought it'd be like past years" Thats why we didnt prep as much we didnt think this tier would be harder due to over tuning of weird mechanics" Keep in mind your a professional..
[5:14:48] belfastcl: imagine if they had to sub to get the mount, like the ff14 thing
[5:14:56] PapaNeeks: @towelliee what’s your favorite Mythic only mechanic or phase?

[5:15:15] TheGiant99: Gate the content and trhe amount of time the raids are available a day
[5:15:21] Zawyer: players can still hurt Blizzard reputation/PR, thats why they cannot get too involved.
[5:15:29] Benuker: mortal strike working on jailer heal is insane AF
[5:15:34] KawaXIV: @Demented7 i kinda agree with you 91Niki, but is there ever an explicitly stated promise that it would only last ~a week? I think the difference with your analogy is there isn't actually that original, pre-changed soccer rulebook in this case
[5:15:37] Thdlock: @kisswani ye same desinger for those 3
[5:15:37] Zawyer: wasnt there a datamined mount that is rumoured to watch the arena finals on youtube stream?
[5:15:40] thunder993: KKona

[5:15:42] thunder993: KEKW
[5:15:52] ashwing_: KEKW
[5:15:53] Demented7: @91Niki ITs like prepping for a soccer game as a kid or as a job u do getting hella money with alot of eyes on. for us it makes sense but for them going over 2 - 3 days isnt that bad lol
[5:16:03] 91Niki: @Demented7 I never said they prepared as much as they should. I just said, there is no way of preparing for that kind of strain they went through.
[5:16:05] Cabbageman007: Hows the Healthy living doing? down weight?
[5:16:06] Birder_L: towOny

[5:17:39] 91Niki: @KawaXIV I was trying to compare mental vs physical strain, since people seem to think there is no such thing as mental strain 🤷 I guess it's flying over peoples heads
[5:17:50] CloosterFlook: i need 9-12 meal plan a week for me XD
[5:18:00] KawaXIV: @Kisswani no date yet. on april 1 we get the live letter for 6.1 and at that point im pretty sure we'll know the dates

[5:19:11] dwillyjpox: I eat like 10 a day
[5:19:13] KawaXIV: @91Niki your point is solid, i was just not loving the soccer game analogy because i dont feel that blizzard actually promises the raids would take a certain amount of time - i don't think they did anything wrong in making a raid that took this long. but i hella agree it must have been tough on the players
[5:19:15] 91Niki: @Demented7 Like i said, i was comparing physical vs mental strain. You can't prepare for that mate.

[5:19:51] plout0n: people worry too much about the size of a meal, and not the calorie content.
[5:19:54] 91Niki: @91Niki I think the difference is, Blizzard knows about RWF, so I feel like they have some sort of responsibility in that sense.
[5:19:57] CloosterFlook: "small" shoot you eat 500 calories x3 a day thats 1500 calories which is all you need if you dont work out and such

[5:33:25] shuunno: ooh nice, im stuck at 1361, only reason i got one honing through was due to pity XD @Towelliee
[5:34:05] CloosterFlook: i pity da foo
[5:34:14] Sylphy_TV: PepeHands damn you gravity
[5:34:17] KawaXIV: i hit full pity like twice just trying to get 600 and quit
[5:34:17] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[5:34:23] KawaXIV: i cannot stand that system
[5:35:06] Scoodles91: small rabits
[5:35:08] KawaXIV: i know i was exceedingly unlucky but still, failing honing is like the content i did that rewarded the crystals didn't reward me anything
[5:35:10] pronkk_: little blue chicken and bunnies
[5:35:13] Soulshine81: Small rabits
[5:35:14] GivTater: purple glowing rabbit things
[5:35:15] Stangin2122: they are little rabbits
[5:35:18] KawaXIV: that's how i feel forced to see it and it means i cant stomach doing the content for those rewards
[5:36:33] KawaXIV: yeah lost ark, message was split between a few messages tho so context is gone by now i guess
[5:36:40] CloosterFlook: nah not being a dick your feelings are valid
[5:36:42] KawaXIV: basically honing failed = its like i didnt get rewarded for content
[5:36:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol

[5:38:04] Ghostpuddlez: Im f2p sitting at 1355, about 370 hours in since release
[5:38:10] edfgregre: i mean why ply the game if they end the game with paying to it soo boring
[5:38:29] TheGiant99: If you bought a founders pack your not F2P
[5:38:33] deadalon: Nice to see you back to WOW :)  PPL finding out fast how bad  Lost Ark really is for  long term gaming.
[5:38:34] Biohzrd604: Asmon just dropped 600 of his own money not counting all mats viewers gave him yesterday
[5:38:37] KawaXIV: and even if there was a way to know those viewers were also free to play, it's still not gonna be the normal average player's gains on f2p, its not representative of normal f2p reward structure relative to progression
[5:38:42] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee what did you think of the ending to Jailer fight?
[5:38:42] Ginbarlo: cost ark

[5:40:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: people pay money to go whale watching, its no different with lost ark whales like Rich Kappa
[5:40:50] Tartxo: @weirdo_dude but he literally depletes his server's entire resources and economy begging.... watch yesterdays stream
[5:40:51] nukemall9405: hows the Hammer squad been doing @towelliee  how long this worlds 1st been going on
[5:41:10] plout0n: "already" kek
[5:41:20] TheGiant99: @t0csik did you buy a founders pack with royal crystals and blue crystals
[5:41:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Was it 19 days for the big race?
[5:41:27] Buckwink: Echo are animals, they will be doing MDI now
[5:41:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Tartxo auction house is region based so its the entire US East
[5:41:39] Maego1: wonder how raiding in Season 4 will look like :D
[5:41:40] t0csik: no founder pack i started after lunch
[5:41:42] Kheonik: they can't take a break, they're 500million gold in debt KEKW
[5:41:43] notorietyy: max will be putting some time into lost ark now i bet
[5:41:45] itsjustcjk: longest race since ToS?
[5:41:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: 18 days is one hell of a race
[5:42:02] Buckwink: Echo's ability to wring out more DPS is insane
[5:42:05] Tartxo: @HaxzorJimDuggan oh even better!
[5:42:40] vocalpenguin: i hope liquid can recover from this
[5:42:45] TheGiant99: Plus I dont get the whole bragging about im x item level and I am free to play.....like does it really matter is it some sort of badge of homor
[5:42:46] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:42:51] N3llee: the fact that jailor drops 2 mounts they should sell that back asap
[5:43:03] Buckwink: carry me to world first mythic 😡
[5:43:09] KawaXIV: is that how they get their gold, in exchange for running people through the content later on?
[5:43:12] NewWorldReign: was it a close RTWF?
[5:43:19] vocalpenguin: echo is just too good
[5:43:23] ARedBeard: people forget about the ad revenue from the twitch ads over 19 days
[5:43:26] nukemall9405: ? this worlds 1st is it based on dungeon progression or something
[5:43:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: wonder how much it would cost to be in the world first kill KEKW
[5:43:32] Fugazi811: Chat is so weird
[5:43:33] N3llee: @KawaXIV yes they sell gear, mounts etc
[5:43:37] t0csik: @TheGiant99 no badge of honor .. just that you can play the game without paying
[5:44:06] TheGiant99: @t0csik just means you got lucky with yopur homings over somebody else
[5:44:44] TyndiVelspaz: hot take: Liquid aren't heroes for calling the race early and "saving" their players. if they cared they wouldn't have let them raid for 14+ hours for 3 weeks. They are spinning it for positive PR because they lost.... just my opinion. fling your hate. I can take it
[5:44:51] whymagie: Do you know if these mythic raiders acctualy earna decent amount of money?
[5:44:55] NiteLancer: hopefully the next RWF doesn't cause as much burnout
[5:45:03] Hitokiri83: @Towelliee what about the raid+ stuff coming in season 4?
[5:45:15] dwillyjpox: Liquid calling it on LoD as just beta testing while echo plowed through it was turning point
[5:45:20] N3llee: @TyndiVelspaz just a bad take
[5:45:32] ARedBeard: @towelliee When I said ad rev, i meant the team's twitch stream, that has to pay for a lot of it
[5:45:34] Crypticedge: @towelliee max said they all share there earnings from streams between the guild
[5:45:36] UberManDude: @Towelliee Did liquid quit?
[5:45:44] pronkk_: @dwillyjpox no, the stars on anduin took away the lead Liquid had
[5:45:51] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz idiotic take
[5:45:53] weighties: Yeah thye said it on stream
[5:46:19] akia03: if you press f1 when you click the elemantal for research you can do all 12 from a single mob
[5:46:31] N3llee: the difference with echo and liquid is liquid had the majority of their players at the event on site. Echo only had like 8-10 players
[5:46:43] Lynasz: Echo had players wanting to go home after 7 days cause they were behind (wtb global release). being behind is just mentally draining, specially after such a long and draining event
[5:46:45] TyndiVelspaz: what other sport doesn't have built in off days?.... this RWF is the only one that doesn't have off days in the schedule. how is that idiotic?
[5:46:46] nemof09: @ubermandude they had to leave the facility they were streaming from
[5:46:48] whiskerbiskitt: roger and scripe said in the same situation they might have called it off sooner
[5:46:50] oberetta: lol at the thought that echo plowed through.  folks who haven't done bleeding edge don't appreciate the difference of having to pull first, totally blind
[5:47:00] Aidler: no idea how method and bdgg are able to continue
[5:47:01] Gigafists: @N3llee False
[5:47:04] Shibb11694: I got the impression that during liquid’s pulls there was too much fucking off in chat/coms tbh compared to echo.
[5:47:05] KawaXIV: that take is super dumb, what? "if they cared they wouldn't let them raid for 14+ hours for 3 weeks. " -- then what would even be the purpose of them being a guild at all? are you basically saying if they cared they wouldn't participate in RWF at all? Cause if that's what it takes to have a shot at the race, then that's what everyone involved is there to do
[5:47:05] TyndiVelspaz: the Le Mans 24 hour swaps out drivers!
[5:47:06] Crypticedge: I mean the second liquid started having negative progression you could just tell it was burn out
[5:47:20] N3llee: @Muttgud echo had their full roster on site.. dont even
[5:47:47] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz RWF is not managed by Blizzard, so your take was idiotic
[5:48:02] thiccsushi: They were there since like the 1st that's a long ass time to be grinding that hard everyday
[5:48:03] whiskerbiskitt: @Shibb11694 but if they had won the bad takes would say that echo was too serious and didn't have enough fun lol
[5:48:04] Gigafists: Echo had 15+ players on site.. alot of them were benched but still the same shit
[5:48:05] UberManDude: @nemof09 Oh okay. Thank you.
[5:48:09] TheGiant99: Ther has got to be a way to protect the guilds from themsleves so they dont burn out. The amount of time the you can access the raid during the day could be regulated for the players well being
[5:48:22] N3llee: @deathformula no shit follow the convo or but out

[5:48:31] UberManDude: @TheGiant99 You mean outside factors?
[5:48:33] Gigafists: + the production + analysts and WA people
[5:48:34] weighties: Exactly especially when theyve already lost for all intents and purpose
[5:48:44] CloosterFlook: LUL sheesh
[5:48:47] weighties: Echo literally killed it 50 minutes after they called it

[5:48:57] N3llee: you could see it they were so roasted
[5:48:59] borgraman: @Towelliee i think its the so called " venue " is the main pressure point. If ppl were doing from home they would have had a different mind set and  yes about time for global release. Peer pressure of performing on uncomfortable locations.
[5:49:10] TyndiVelspaz: they should have taken a day off when they started to feel the burn out. limit it instead of trying to push through it.
[5:49:14] Whatupdays: Whatupdays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 56 month streak! Grats to Echo but I was cheering for Liquid
[5:49:26] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz you didn't. My point was that it's not officially managed by blizzard so there's no built in anything. It's all community managed stuff so people go nuts with their hours if they have to.
[5:49:34] Crypticedge: People just wanna hate and create unnecessary drama. If you can’t tell they were burnt you obviously don’t know what you’re talking about
[5:49:49] kw3nk: I wouldnt mind if RWF doesnt exist. Like in the old days, where the last bosses stand for months
[5:49:56] Zeke_nl: They were 100% burnt out they had a terrible raid day yesterday. They made the right choice
[5:50:02] UberManDude: @Crypticedge The people who do not see that obviously do not pay bills Lol
[5:50:07] MissTrixi: and it was a well deserved perfect kill to Echo..
[5:50:09] nemof09: After 19 days anyone would be burnt lol
[5:50:10] WOOPsWOOP: I think it's a mistake to take them all out of there most comfortable environment, if they raided from home they'd not get burnt out
[5:50:19] Crypticedge: @ubermandude true lol
[5:50:19] MenschIstDerUnited: burned out after 10 days kekw
[5:50:25] nemof09: Hell after 2 hours I get burnt out
[5:50:26] jmalmin: One thing is sure. Blizzard put up some great bosses which did push these raiders to the limit.
[5:50:27] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee what did you think of the ending to Jailer fight?
[5:50:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can solo it with my bear, just move out of the webs
[5:50:43] TheGiant99: Blizz should take control of it next race and set times for when the raidsa are uo during the day. Or give each team a set amount of time each day they cant go over
[5:50:48] Gigafists: @MenschIstDerUnited LMAO more like 26 days 16h+/day
[5:50:49] Crypticedge: @menschistderunited 10 days? They been prepping and in Boston since Feb 28th
[5:50:50] highlydegen: the anduin kill was the hypest thing all race
[5:50:51] KawaXIV: am I wrong to think that Blizzard doesn't explicity suggest that anyone *should* chase world first? It's not a concept built into the raid inherently, right? Then they really shouldn't be responsible for preventing the players from playing too much. RWF is not a blizzard sanctioned event, its just people caring about who clears content first, no?
[5:51:01] N3llee: scribe and max said this raid had some of the hardest bosses in the history of wow
[5:51:01] Sicknessqt: @MenschIstDerUnited 19* days and also 16 hours per day. thats alot
[5:51:03] dwillyjpox: It’s fair to say it was burnout but I know for a fact it wasn’t even a 50/50 decision on burnout. Most wanted to keep going
[5:51:07] NewWorldReign: Blizzard recovered a shit ton from this raid since the SL release fuck up.
[5:51:08] TyndiVelspaz: @kheonik but they don't have to. they should have called it after Anduin or hell after Ryghelon and given the team a day or two off to recharge. but instead they got greedy and tried to power through a burnout that caused them to have diminished productivity.
[5:51:16] jkitchin75: @MenschIstDerUnited are you dumb or just trying to troll
[5:51:22] borgraman: i like this untested bosses it was like that in classic / TBC  this is just byproduct of PTR

[5:51:41] salmonman78x: I get it completely, hell day 2 each week my guild by the end of the night we're all grumpy AF.
[5:51:44] weighties: Taking a day is giving up, its not like you can win the race after not playing for a day or two
[5:51:57] TyndiVelspaz: having the psychologists there is a BIG plus that I'm glad they did
[5:52:00] Hybridwarhawk: I like all the arm chair raiders that come out after a RWF ends.
[5:52:05] KawaXIV: @TyndiVelspaz no other team is going to stop and also take a break just because you did, it would pretty much be throwing
[5:52:11] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz you don't understand. When the competition pushes through you don't have a choice whether or not you do the same or not. If you want to win, and both of the teams want to, you have to push.
[5:52:12] weighties: You either give up at that point or hope to push through it
[5:52:14] jkitchin75: towStop towIt
[5:52:25] TheGiant99: I think alot of the issue is that alot of people in the regular woirk force are over wokred and have mental issues but that is never talked about.

[5:52:53] Templexx: yea it was like 2 days of no prog
[5:52:56] TyndiVelspaz: @kheonik so winning is more important than human health. got it
[5:52:57] WOOPsWOOP: simple facts
[5:52:58] uglla3np: why couldn't they reach P4 even though it was shown to them how to do it
[5:52:58] itsjustcjk: the whole guild spoke for an hour and came to a decision to stop together
[5:53:02] nemof09: Mdi is also coming up
[5:53:05] vocalpenguin: ofc. they were regressing 2 days in a row. he said it was the worst day of progression in the guild's history
[5:53:12] Buckwink: Echo wanted it more
[5:53:13] Evcon_: yeah comms were diff the last 3 days for sure
[5:53:14] N3llee: yea they had players that had to go home, trill was in the pvp stuff. Missing keys players is rough for a race that close and that long
[5:53:18] UberManDude: @TheGiant99 True. I work 16 hours a day for four days in a week. I need my rest for real
[5:53:25] holyheals11: hey @Towelliee have played since legion, would it be hard / weird to try to get back into this xpac?
[5:53:27] Exodeo_: I just hate people being so toxic about it, Limit made the right choice for their mental health
[5:53:31] ambiotic: look at the bubble year in the nba, lots and lot of players and teams opted out because they were burnt out and didnt want to be away from their homes that long, but gamers are supposed to be stronger somehow?
[5:53:46] N3llee: you can see it in the pull count
[5:53:57] Zeke_nl: All the normal and heroic Andy’s speaking up
[5:53:57] uglla3np: that's the problem about exaggerated positivity, it can turn into depression more quickly
[5:54:16] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz that is not what I'm saying at all. They want to win and in order to win you just have play basically too much because there is no official management of the race so there are no restrictions to hours spent either.
[5:54:20] dragonkatz: LUL
[5:54:21] TheGiant99: So Imagine if they didnt raid 16 hours a day and they had a set schedule for say 10 hours a day. It would be way better for the players
[5:54:34] dwillyjpox: They should have stayed until echo won. Echo wiped at 1% like 5 times back to back and the victory was insight
[5:54:39] akia03: @greasygringogaming its not bliz event they dont have to do anything
[5:54:44] weighties: Yeah and imagine them loosing by a week cause echo raids 16 hours a day lol
[5:54:55] Aidler: premier league comparisons….lol
[5:54:57] UberManDude: @spellton Lol.
[5:55:25] UberManDude: @Towelliee 23 days until?
[5:55:27] TyndiVelspaz: @kheonik no there isn't any official management however the management of each team is responsible for the members of the team therefore they bear responsibility for their health. which doesn't seem like they prioritized
[5:55:27] Conman1986: Watford and Hull are both bad, either works
[5:55:29] Neldur: how long you think till next expac? Next year?
[5:55:34] TheGiant99: Blizz could inforce it
[5:55:41] TheGiant99: they cointrol the servers
[5:55:43] KawaXIV: @TheGiant99 then some other team comes around and raids 16 hours and takes it for free. how do you get every team to agree to the same limitations? asking blizzard to do it? Blizzard doesn't condone the RWF inherently, RWF is a social construct, a community construct, not a built in part of raiding
[5:55:48] brickimus: @towelliee how much of liquids inability to progress was due to their healing comp? There seemed to always be priest deaths but they didn’t stray from the holy priests.
[5:55:56] dregusx: what about boss pull count?
[5:55:58] TheGiant99: Blizard regyklates the servers its easy
[5:56:00] dregusx: only X in a week
[5:56:01] WOOPsWOOP: Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, if a team can't compete then it's there fault, not the games fault
[5:56:02] Bruzzi: What up T, how you doing
[5:56:04] KawaXIV: world first is a social construct
[5:56:07] WSquiggle12: @TheGiant99 that would require them to give a shit lmao
[5:56:08] UberManDude: @KawaXIV Facts.
[5:56:16] dregusx: Boss pull count
[5:56:18] TheGiant99: Make the content accessable at certain times
[5:56:18] dwillyjpox: Mortal strike ftw
[5:56:22] WhoIsAndrewJ: yeah, why not
[5:56:25] N3llee: YOU DONT WANT BLIZZ MEDLING IN ANY RWF STUFF
[5:56:25] thymos_: thats a good idea POGGERS
[5:56:28] manmower: you only get 10 hours of gametime per day for all players
[5:56:28] WhoIsAndrewJ: make a tournament realm
[5:56:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: this isn't china
[5:56:30] N3llee: o caps sorry mods
[5:56:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol 10 hour debuff would really piss people off
[5:56:32] VipMalis: you die and get sent to barrens
[5:56:38] 91Niki: The only way of doing that is making RWF on servers similar to arenas
[5:56:39] manmower: logs you out after, gotta pay extra if you want more hours
[5:56:40] RustproofSage: it is a good solution tho.. 10 hours time outs in raid zones
[5:56:41] salmonman78x: @Towelliee Like when mom would unplug the Nintendo if you were on it for too long. lol
[5:56:45] Ezekyler: SWAT players Kappa
[5:56:46] UberManDude: @HaxzorJimDuggan LMAO right?
[5:56:55] vocalpenguin: reddit takes
[5:56:56] Llamatude: global release then whos day time do we start at?
[5:56:57] jridablo: you can sign up your team for world first
[5:56:58] 91Niki: You still gotta take time zones into account
[5:56:59] akia03: they would just make more alts to get more 10 hour lock outs
[5:57:02] weighties: They had pull counts in wrath and look how they turned out
[5:57:03] KawaXIV: i mean i think global release is a good idea in isolation, regardless of any other changes OMEGALUL
[5:57:13] thymos_: KEKW
[5:57:17] TheGiant99: It shouldnt be hard to figure out it a video game
[5:57:18] Biohzrd604: Could do that with realm timers or log in timers
[5:57:20] c3llout7: c3llout7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[5:57:25] Ezekyler: more splits Pog
[5:57:32] Soulofdragon01: @akia03 account wide debuff can be done
[5:57:37] Horseweave: Still have  to do the Raid
[5:57:51] akia03: more acounts @Soulofdragon01
[5:57:56] Llamatude: @KawaXIV what would global release fix? then you have people getting up at like 3am to start raiding they are tired not on A game..
[5:57:59] PapeJohn: Do you play classic anymore?
[5:58:00] Soulofdragon01: then blizz can get more money with more accounts :D
[5:58:00] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz they've never had to prioritize it. It's all about winning. This was the longest race since forever. Getting as burnt out as people did hasn't happened before so it most likely wasn't taken into account.
[5:58:00] TheGiant99: you dont need a debuff you onyl give them access during certain times
[5:58:02] Kelticlore: have the buff be affective account wide
[5:58:04] RustproofSage: account timeout like 10 dungeon in a row it'll block you from joining more
[5:58:18] Dragonsland7: Area-52?
[5:58:21] leeviate: top teams compete on private server before launch of raid maybe?
[5:58:26] 91Niki: @Towelliee you could make RWF similar to the arena servers for pvp tournaments or m+. But that would require Blizzard to actually be part of RWF like the other tournaments

[5:58:49] kayron_brennan: 💩 server
[5:58:51] vocalpenguin: the whole point is being world first on live server
[5:58:51] Dragonsland7: Bleeding?
[5:59:01] 91Niki: Yeah indeed.
[5:59:08] leeviate: but what if you did before launch
[5:59:19] D3mitr1: tourney realm race would be messy
[5:59:24] NewWorldReign: Now what for Blizzard, turn Sylvanas into a martyr and give her leadership again? OR make her like second in command to new Undercity?
[5:59:27] 91Niki: !bnet
[5:59:27] Moobot: @91Niki NA Btag | Towelliee#1402
[5:59:34] TyndiVelspaz: @kheonik I'm sorry but that isn't a valid excuse. when you see players saying they are burnout on Twitter. you need to understand that is an issue and act on it. burnout can happen at any time, be it after 5 says or 15
[5:59:37] lmtheboogie: blizzard has to first come out and say they care about the race and then we can move forward from there
[5:59:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: if the retail realm guilds beat the tournament realm guilds it would be embarrassing LUL
[5:59:47] leeviate: oooo fair enough
[5:59:47] D3mitr1: good point
[5:59:47] weighties: The bottom line is Blizzard tunes these raids for for those Guilds. This raid was really hard.  THe guilds didnt expect to be raiding for 3 weeks
[5:59:49] WhoIsAndrewJ: What's wrong with that?
[5:59:53] weighties: because why would they
[5:59:54] Bulldawgx: @towelliee how do you make it so the Rare Skulls always stay up on your map??  I already have Rare Scanner installed
[6:00:03] smashwow: i mean they kinda do that today for MDI
[6:00:05] jmalmin: Actually Sylvanas looks to be taken a break for awhile in the maw. She will be back in a few expansions.
[6:00:18] Llamatude: @lmtheboogie they already did they by moving MDI
[6:00:22] ambiotic: what makes rwf fun is the community aspect of players from all servers helping their region, you do tourney realm that goes away and it feels meh
[6:00:23] TheGiant99: In a couple weeks nobody will care anymore nayway
[6:00:28] Mecabeast: what if the tournament round people got their items sent to live realm but locked them from doing mythic on live if they do it on tournament
[6:00:28] Maego1: and again what difference would tournament realm make instead of global release :D
[6:00:45] 91Niki: They'd have to release the raid on tournament realms only. But i don't even wanna imagine the uproar that would cause on the forums KEKW
[6:00:59] KawaXIV: blizzard should actually go even more hands off on RWF than they currently are, if you ask me. No congratulations tweet, no live hotfixes, balance patching, etc. just work on any necessary fixes in the background and drop them in a bigger patch like a week later, etc, and completely disregard the fact that anyone's racing at all. treat it like any other content release. RWF IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
[6:00:59] Bulldawgx: Okay thanks @Towelliee
[6:01:08] weighties: Tune it different or just let the guilds know what theyre signing up for is what both Echo and Liquid said. You dont need all the measures in place to stop the guilds
[6:01:13] nemof09: I guess have them qualify in previous season then have rwf before the content drops on live servers
[6:01:19] Kelticlore: they could have Mythic on Non-Tournament not become active till the reset after the world first is over
[6:01:21] NewWorldReign: Do you think Tournament Realms can kill a new game?
[6:01:26] Eraste: they lost like a week and a half to degen splits
[6:01:31] smashwow: they do that for the great push and MDI. i don't see the difference for raiding at this point. it's a contest of "who is the best"
[6:01:32] thymos_: @KawaXIV you wrote a whole thread WutFace
[6:01:32] stiefbruderr: no reason for blizz to do much really though. guilds will Deven as much as they can no matter what. even if its acct wide debuff they'll just get alt accounts.

[6:01:54] Kheonik: @TyndiVelspaz it isn't but like again it's all about winning, it isn't officially managed, any orgs behind the teams are there to just support the teams in their efforts and not manage them it seems. Your original take was dumb. That's it.
[6:01:57] Everbliss: I dont understand why raid difficulty = subscripbers. wouldnt super hardcore stuff alienate most players
[6:01:59] nemof09: But then gear comes into question should they get the best of the best?
[6:02:08] leeviate: NOOOO ADD
[6:02:17] KawaXIV: @Thymos_ its because i'm 30 so i'm that MMO boomer who writes essays in twitch chat that get scrolled offscreen in 0.2 seconds like asmon often jokes about
[6:02:23] mmo_kenna_: First world problems the race lasting abit longer
[6:02:25] 91Niki: Don't you just love getting ads as a sub, cuz i fucking do
[6:02:35] leeviate: really wanted to hear that point got hit with ads lol
[6:02:38] TyndiVelspaz: @kheonik you say it's dumb but you keep supporting my original take with your responses. so thank you.
[6:02:45] mclovinzrp: #adblock ftw
[6:02:46] Im_a_sad_man: I think blizzard should focus more on the game rather than the race.
[6:02:55] thymos_: @KawaXIV I'm incapable of reading more than 1 sentence FeelsBadMan
[6:02:55] smashwow: @91Niki it's rare but it happens and it sucks

[6:03:27] KawaXIV: blizzard should totally ignore the existence of the race, no congratulations tweet, no hotfixing, batch patching to like every week or something, RWF is a social construct

[6:03:35] Im_a_sad_man: Yeah that was my logic
[6:03:43] jmalmin: I do not think Blizzard do not focus that much on the race. They just want to build good raids something they have done for years now.
[6:03:50] Velashen: Yeah if anything it shows the raid team is killing it and the other teams need to step up.
[6:04:02] Eraste: i hope this season 4 thing is the beginning of making old content relevant and not planning to make patches to be obsolete in 8 months
[6:04:09] lmtheboogie: @Towelliee I think you're right. Blizzard should at least give these world first guilds a heads up on how long they think it will take to complete the raids on mythic
[6:04:18] Gurtogg: method getting consisten 25-30% pulls now, impressive
[6:04:20] swordart2022: Never happening.
[6:04:27] lithium364: or the other teams wont get any priority to help them out with their content
[6:04:38] Shrenko: Ony bark towOny
[6:04:59] tigress75422: yea they should otherwise one of these world first raiders in the event is gonna keel over at that rate
[6:05:19] MrFariaH: josh allen left blizz ??? Is that true ? :(
[6:05:20] tigress75422: if it keeps going like that with no warning or ballpark if 3+ weeks like that
[6:05:27] mmo_kenna_: Oh no these top players had to sacrifice an extra week to be the best in the world
[6:05:27] stiefbruderr: why get involved, it will only backfire because people can't be happy. can't ballpark time spent when they don't know how degen people are going to be

[6:05:48] swordart2022: @stiefbruderr
[6:05:54] swordart2022: @stiefbruderr true lul
[6:06:04] leeviate: i guess on second though i think i would enjoy it more if they just did nothing lol made bad ass raids and the community competes amongst itself the idea of a random guild getting the achivment before a top guild is awesome
[6:06:20] nemof09: Feign death ftw
[6:06:23] mmo_kenna_: boohoo 3 weeks too long, what about people who have to work away or military etc
[6:06:40] mmo_kenna_: that's a sacrifice they have to take
[6:07:04] swordart2022: so why whine then lol
[6:07:06] ohnot___her: Your tweet yesterday had some WEIRD takes in the replys
[6:07:10] Llamatude: @Towelliee did Lulaboo wanna stay longer or was she ready to come home?
[6:07:15] tigress75422: no shit. but when they have to take a week or more longer than intended when alot of them put their own life on hold for the event
[6:07:32] Specsifier: pattyHowdy Towelliee. All the Post Race bad takes coming out today then?
[6:07:34] ProjectGrace_: @lmtheboogie I hope that never happen! Blizzard needs no stop making the raid scoping suck small percentage of the player base.
[6:07:38] scarface9113: its like you take a job a few hundred miles from your home, it is planned to take X amount of time, if it lasts longer your life gets distrupted
[6:07:49] mmo_kenna_: life on hold? that is their lives Fe it's their job we all have to work
[6:08:08] nemof09: They have lives away from the game lol

[6:08:45] dwillyjpox: Nice hotel room catered meals and a nice gaming venue? Sounds like vacation to me
[6:08:47] KawaXIV: yeah but surely these guys all understand that there's no promises about how long it took, predictions maybe based on the past but that's not a promise. when they go away to raid don't they tell their families there's no knowing how long it will actually take?
[6:08:49] mmo_kenna_: I have a life outside of work but I still gotta do what I gotta do
[6:09:26] Kheonik: People have some nuclear takes KEKW

[6:09:33] dwillyjpox: That race was awesome though
[6:09:34] Eraste: ya im enjoying seeing it all, then can go back to forgetting about wow until 10.0
[6:09:36] 91Niki: Holy shit people are stupid

[6:09:41] Nokterian: towStop towIt
[6:09:57] Specsifier: some actual clown takes in chat today
[6:09:58] Aidler: what people don’t get is that the prep for the RWF started weeks before the official start of the race
[6:10:00] Llamatude: was Lulaboo ready to come home or did she want to extend as well?
[6:10:00] WOOPsWOOP: I mean there playing video games its not evven work Kappa
[6:10:01] weighties: Yeah pull bosses ad nauseum  for 16 hours a day and talk about your vacay after haha
[6:10:02] thymos_: @dwillyjpox actually true KEKW
[6:10:03] theDirtyon3: yeah that announcement cant come soon enough KEKW
[6:10:07] brewsuadeshoes: If we're using the "everyone has to work" comparison, isn't it also up to the business to make sure their people are taken care of? Max & Co. made the right call
[6:10:10] weighties: for 3 weeks straight
[6:10:11] 91Niki: Brain actually hurts
[6:10:16] uglla3np: @Towelliee what do you expect from 10.0 ?
[6:10:19] mmo_kenna_: ohh these poor raiders, if you want to be the best you have to go places no will else will
[6:10:23] jburrns: any tips for a returning player trying to get back into it before th next expansion? i find myself not knowing what to do
[6:10:26] swordart2022: @Aidler you think people care for it ? LUL dont want to play like degen  they dont lol
[6:10:29] Basic_BS: April 19th cant come soon enough, people will finally have something to talk about
[6:10:37] KawaXIV: man i would love to world race (in FFXIV) someday, I'm intending to push for earlier and earlier personal clears each tier and see how far I can get but I'll probably never really reach it.
[6:10:38] stiefbruderr: participation trophy happens when you change things for quitters Kappa
[6:10:39] dwillyjpox: Give me a break if liquid was in first place they wouldn’t of been burnt out
[6:10:40] jmalmin: i really really hope for a down to earth expansion in 10.0. Create villians for us to fight in a few expansions.
[6:10:43] swordart2022: @JBurnsTV read your spellbook and quests.
[6:10:44] theDirtyon3: @mmo_kenna_ shit tier take but alright
[6:10:50] WOOPsWOOP: APRIL 19 POG
[6:10:55] Fugazi811: Chat is so toxic
[6:11:00] liden86: @mmo_kenna_ you're dumb, shush
[6:11:05] thymos_: @Basic_BS we could talk about how pandas are ruining the game
[6:11:05] nemof09: Y’all tripping today
[6:11:05] Colt_Engineer: BC Kalthusas was also extremely buggy
[6:11:07] Kheonik: @mmo_kenna_ holy shit you gotta stop with these takes
[6:11:08] swordart2022: @KawaXIV there is race in ffxiv as far i know
[6:11:09] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee What do you think about St. Peters making it to the Elite 8?
[6:11:16] Im_a_sad_man: Im curios why shadowlands did have 1 patch less than bfa and end up less content in alot of fields compared to battle for azeroth.
[6:11:17] dwillyjpox: So if liquid was in first place they would have said let’s call it for burn out? Get out of here
[6:11:29] KawaXIV: @fairplay2021 yes there is, I know that, I said i'd like to be participating in it some day
[6:11:31] tigress75422: and you know blizz is an epic failure on communicating to anybody at this point
[6:11:31] nemof09: Acting like it’s so easy why not y’all in the race then lol
[6:11:32] swordart2022: @dwillyjpox nope they were behind
[6:11:34] ijuki: Blizzard: "Git gud Kappa "
[6:11:38] michaelmm: I wonder if Blizzard foresaw it would take longer?
[6:11:45] Hybridwarhawk: Some of these takes make think some people bet their rent money on Liquid or something
[6:11:45] weighties: Exactly liquid called it and echo killed it an hour later
[6:11:53] theDirtyon3: @dwillyjpox Scrype literally said they would have done the same thing wahts your point?
[6:11:53] weighties: idk how people can fault them for it honestly
[6:12:10] RustproofSage: this was never the plan, the jailer and probably ryg an dreadlords were to be put in another raid
[6:12:14] weighties: seems like pure ignorance
[6:12:23] Rudric_Ice: I loved how the race actually went long
[6:12:26] ijuki: I can say this or that, but I have to give props to the top guilds, no matter region for amazing display of skills shown SeemsGood
[6:12:29] nemof09: @spellton They think it’s easy to@do@since you’re just sitting there playing a game
[6:12:30] WOOPsWOOP: Its not like they really gave up early they did their best
[6:12:34] mmo_kenna_: Sounds like a bunch of sore losers to me
[6:12:35] Eolus99: This raid is ltierally the hardest bosses from two raid put together
[6:12:39] Texas_Mizfit: liquid in my opinion didnt think the race was going to week 3 so they did nt go get rep for the 291 leggos

[6:14:03] KawaXIV: @Towelliee is half as many bosses per raid but raids releasing twice as frequently a better or worse option to make more people happy and less burnout prone?
[6:14:07] throwawaym3: AWC looking sick
[6:14:11] leeviate: whats the time gap between the top teams that have all this funding and some casual joes guild at home

[6:14:17] Shrenko: they allready went back to normal, no?
[6:14:18] Rotlung: they did give it their all
[6:14:19] Alienfromger: no prizemoney or honor for world second :(
[6:14:22] Randomhero85: Randomhero85 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[6:14:26] nemof09: It’s not like you win anything for rwf they’ve already been paid by their sponsors so why keep stressing out your raiders
[6:14:43] Frizankbeast: Months
[6:14:43] swordart2022: Months :P
[6:14:49] theDirtyon3: Liquid already got the bag no need to stress anymore TBH KEKW
[6:14:52] i_cassius: They claimed to be the number 1 guild and then complained the race was to long even though it had no time frame there was always a possibility it could go on longer than last tier
[6:15:08] weighties: A month and a pile of nerfs probably
[6:15:17] dright424: Doesnt Fat Shark Yes only raid a couple days a week?
[6:15:21] mmo_kenna_: They claimed bosses were unkillable and Echo just went and killed it
[6:15:22] NiteLancer: gotta get that Sandwich Love
[6:15:25] jridablo: you paid to win lol
[6:15:28] vocalpenguin: gonna be lots of turnover i think
[6:15:40] c0mmander_starscream: At least they still have their "Fast food" jobs as a fall back
[6:15:43] stiefbruderr: quitting that late because of "mental health" is stupid. you put your raiders in that mental for no reason if your gonna quit do it early
[6:15:43] KingSlayerYotam: imagine getting a whole raiding team to 275 avg, people forget most people need months to get to that
[6:15:47] weighties: I mean yes lords was killable but only to like 3 guilds
[6:15:53] Kheonik: @dright424 no, they raid 7 days a week for progress, they just don't day raid as in they only raid in the evenings
[6:15:53] KawaXIV: average joe was a weird term to use, how about like top guilds but not sponsored and not travelling to fancy facilities and under a big org - a serious guild but everyone's playing at home and they're not under a brand
[6:16:01] nemof09: Sponsors are paying for them to win?
[6:16:01] Eraste: @stiefbruderr danDerp
[6:16:05] leeviate: i mean if all that funding is the reason those teams are a week ahead then yah all thats on the orgs to either pay them enough to be able to stay but also they gotta trust you to do it
[6:16:09] weighties: and probs to echo for putting that comp together to down lords honestly
[6:16:18] Aidler: when there is money there is pressure
[6:16:19] Specsifier: some real dumbass takes KEKW
[6:16:22] nemof09: But liquid also plays other games don’t they?
[6:16:34] Eraste: ya some of you are genuinely dumb KEKW
[6:16:38] bigbud0000: lol
[6:16:46] tigress75422: god ppl are cancer today
[6:16:47] mmo_kenna_: I'm watching the F1 right now, it's in Saudi it's not fair the racers have to be away from their families
[6:16:49] swordart2022: monkaHmm
[6:16:51] ZonnyArk: liquid :)
[6:16:53] Shalodar: You want to have that sponsor the next time, too. But mad respect for prioritizing their raiders regardless, was a great race to watch! luxthoPog
[6:16:57] thymos_: monkaHmm
[6:16:57] tigress75422: like think before you speak
[6:17:04] Ezcotli: LUL
[6:17:06] i_cassius: I guess echo are “solid” raiders
[6:17:11] Exodeo_: asking twitch chat to think Kappa
[6:17:14] bigbud0000: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[6:17:16] solsaver12: Its all about money now.
[6:17:18] Alienfromger: lets strawpoll LUL
[6:17:19] N3llee: @Towelliee think there will be any fall out with liquid sponsorship
[6:17:21] Eraste: @mmo_kenna_ omg give it up you're killin yourself KEKW
[6:17:31] ijuki: @davey_wavey06 Towel didn't get the joke Kappa
[6:17:33] flebbooo: Accurate KEKW
[6:17:38] Eolus99: Max said one of the biggest makes they made was a comp change, he said it killed their progress
[6:17:40] Shrenko: why are we even arguing about this, its done!!

[6:17:43] Specsifier: that Arms warrior swap was pretty fuckin clever honestly
[6:17:46] pronkk_: ADDERALL HELPS
[6:17:47] leeviate: yah but f1 are professional racers thats the point i think is the wow raid pros still have day jobs
[6:17:50] pronkk_: oops caps
[6:17:56] KawaXIV: everyone whos world racing REALLY wants to be there -- at least to the limit of their expectations of how long it could take. if 18 days is unprecedented fair enough but I think going almost up until the point that your rival wins still shows that despite all the difficulty they wanted to be there still
[6:18:01] Zeke_nl: That jailer kill was insane
[6:18:05] leeviate: so unless the orgs can pay them enought to be away from all that then its not worth it
[6:18:06] ProjectGrace_: I hope they keep making harder. Raiding suppose to be a progression content.  If ppl want to burned out because they choose to do for a community challenge be my guest. I hope blizzard stop listening and rounding things out for a suck small percentage of the player base. I hope they never officially host RWF. If they that would push more the casual players. Which btw ppl who still thinking that casual players are useless should rethink about it.
[6:18:17] Dragunstorm15: it also sucks when you lose trill 2 weekends in a row you lose mavae and you lose scott their MT

[6:18:44] leeviate: but people can world race from  home its the orgs that are choosing to do all that showmanship and extra stuff
[6:18:46] weighties: @ProjectGrace_  YOu realize that only the 5 or 10 guilds see this content
[6:18:50] Zeke_nl: It’s kinda disappointing that limit had that big switch to liquid and then the race ended like that

[6:19:15] Nokterian: towCry no EU
[6:19:16] weighties: Every boss in this raid will be nerfed before even the hall of fame guilds kill it
[6:19:21] ottawolf: Available in Canada? @Towelliee
[6:19:54] Nokterian: Sounds delicious
[6:20:05] ottawolf: damn meals ound great
[6:20:24] Nokterian: towStop towIt
[6:20:24] KawaXIV: coming from ffxiv i kinda hate the idea that these bosses will be nerfed
[6:20:34] KawaXIV: imagine never getting the chance to do something equivalent to what they did, even if you do it later with gear
[6:20:40] KawaXIV: idk
[6:20:41] ProjectGrace_: @
[6:20:47] Daggerstry: But these people want exclusives, so it should be hard
[6:20:50] KawaXIV: part of what makes doing the highest difficulty thing exciting is knowing its the hardest
[6:20:51] jkitchin75: have some folks just giving there brain the day off today or what
[6:20:56] KawaXIV: but when they nerf the boss, the hardest thing ceases to exist
[6:20:58] ProjectGrace_: Progression
[6:20:59] KawaXIV: except for the people who raced it
[6:21:05] throwawaym3: Brain dead people be like Hard = Good
[6:21:05] tigress75422: its not fun...that would just drive ppl away
[6:21:09] KawaXIV: ?
[6:21:10] Rudric_Ice: 2 weeks is FINE
[6:21:15] ProjectGrace_: That calls progression
[6:21:16] nemof09: Lol
[6:21:16] Fugazi811: Idiots galore in chat today
[6:21:17] valianya: Blizzard should give them a temp server for RWF with gear vendors and shut it down at specific times for mandatory breaks.  Or just stop tuning for just RWF guilds.
[6:21:19] lithium364: classic andys
[6:21:24] Eraste: its easy to want something you'll never participate in
[6:21:27] KawaXIV: aspirational content is good for mmos
[6:21:29] Everbliss: But HARDER =  BETTER right ?!!1111
[6:21:30] Specsifier: lemme tell ya, as a normal mode raid player, I REALLY want the raid to be needlessly complex
[6:21:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[6:21:34] ijuki: But imagine the race... 1000 guilds on the same boss POGGERS
[6:21:40] Alienfromger: AOC save us and give us real hard raids Kappa
[6:22:00] weighties: @ProjectGrace_  How long is your guilds progression?
[6:22:16] KawaXIV: i mean clearing a raid you progged for months is an amazing feeling
[6:22:19] tigress75422: harder is not always better. its making  a good encounter tuned right
[6:22:20] throwawaym3: Hard = Good Kappa
[6:22:36] leeviate: they need to just make a difficulty above mythic the LEEROY JENKINS mode for the real hardcore lol
[6:22:41] InfamousMaverick: InfamousMaverick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[6:22:55] Daggerstry: Blizzard should not nerf it until after the Famed kills happen
[6:22:57] mmo_kenna_: They can nerf Mythic after RWF, it needs to be insane for these guilds this race has proved that
[6:22:58] weighties: Because unless youre in the top 0.1% of guilds its going to take you months for CE. Hows that for progression
[6:23:13] Frawlsworld: Frawlsworld subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 98 months, currently on a 98 month streak! 
[6:23:16] Eolus99: This raid is literally all the hard bosses from two separate raids put together @Towelliee
[6:23:19] jridablo: thats why they on top 100s to 1000s they dont have the mentality to be on the top
[6:23:25] tigress75422: why do you think ppl have been leaving in droves and guilds falling apart these days? difficulty is not always an answer
[6:23:32] valianya: 1000 guilds stuck on same boss means its not a test of skill but total RNG, or the winner will be whoever finds a cheese strategy
[6:23:38] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @spellton you mean 0.001
[6:23:38] bonkyouded: naha CN was the banger of the this expansion
[6:23:39] Basic_BS: its agme bro, who the fuck wants to be on top
[6:23:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mr. Crab is a prick lol
[6:23:53] Eraste: @tigress75422 i mean, cause the game is just boring, nothing about difficult raids
[6:23:55] Colt_Engineer: I'm still in love with tomb of soakarrus
[6:24:19] Aidler: yeah, the crab is crap
[6:24:21] weighties: @ZippoIsFreeFromJail  Exactly and these guys think it needs to take what a year to clear the instance lol
[6:24:25] Daggerstry: Why would Blizz nerf it so you can clear it just to leave the game though?
[6:24:41] KawaXIV: maybe if it needs to be nerfed it shouldn't be that hard in the first place even for limit and echo - even if its not as hard as it is now it's not like someone can't do it faster than someone else, there's still a race even if its not overtuned
[6:24:41] SensationalBanana: Shadowlands managed to burn me out, and I'm a 10+ year no-lifer normally...
[6:24:41] Scoodles91: who would want to farm 10h M+ for 1 item drop
[6:24:56] Shrenko: classic Kappa
[6:24:58] Im_a_sad_man: LUL 19 thats some blackrock foundry levels
[6:24:59] ijuki: Well, m+ hasn't changed much (and it is difficult to change it too)
[6:25:01] jkitchin75: @TinyTyzaa towStop towIt
[6:25:02] KawaXIV: i just think a raid coming out and then subsequently getting nerfed makes the prospect of eventually doing it yourself, even if done with more gear, less exciting
[6:25:03] Cyraxe_: The Early Shift got WF Vigilant Guardian and hasn't progressed since, lol.
[6:25:07] Eraste: i came back to 9.2 and played for like 3-4 hours before logging off. they really need to change up SOMETHING
[6:25:09] valianya: They always massively nerfbat after RWF

[6:25:28] Scoodles91: ppl spamed m+ in legion cause it actualy droped loot
[6:25:30] KawaXIV: thats true but it probably shouldn't be that way
[6:25:37] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Is the last raid..so they wanna extend it
[6:25:37] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[6:25:39] kodtheog: whats with these games and burn out lately lost ark is doing the same to me Sadge
[6:25:46] weighties: @KawaXIV  The average guild count kill plain and simple if it wasnt nerfd
[6:25:54] weighties: Couldnt**
[6:26:11] weighties: THey would all burn out and quit
[6:26:13] JimmyBeardSlam: with pocopoc
[6:26:13] cidthesloth420: coreless ayelid beside the pool
[6:26:15] theDirtyon3: Pocopoc
[6:26:16] Molvonos: Gotta use pocapoc
[6:26:16] mmo_kenna_: I think it's amazing they managed to put out bosses that gave them so much challenge. best RWF I've ever watched
[6:26:17] akia03: pocopoc needs to controll the robot
[6:26:17] michaelmm: use pocopoc
[6:26:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: you have to tell poco to jump in the squid
[6:26:22] Biohzrd604: Have to use Pocopoc on the console
[6:26:23] Eraste: @Eraste thats all fine but there's more to WoW than just a month of raiding every 8 months and no interesting content otherwise
[6:26:24] Scoodles91: control the octupus on the shore, and it will take it out
[6:26:27] cidthesloth420: right
[6:26:30] CazualD: Have to use pocopoc somehow
[6:26:31] KawaXIV: @spellton then release it at the difficulty it would end up at post-nerf in the first place
[6:26:34] Cyraxe_: @towelliee You need to do cypher research and then have your pocopoc control the dude on the side of the lake.
[6:26:34] CazualD: i think
[6:26:38] ProjectGrace_: That’s why the game have lfr. Normal. Heroic. Mythic. But yep I agreed that it should be tune and hey I’m one off them waiting for the nerf because is not my first rodeo. But say that blizz should rounding things up for RWF hell no! Frick that  not gonna round a progression mode for some sweating nerds that wants to burn out because they decided to omega speed because of community challenge.
[6:26:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: not the console, there is a squid laying on the edge of the water
[6:26:51] akia03: its beehind you
[6:26:54] valianya: If they want RWF hardmode then Blizzard should give them a temp server for RWF with gear vendors and shut it down at specific times for mandatory breaks
[6:26:54] weighties: @KawaXIV  Cause WF raiders would kill it in 2 days
[6:26:55] cidthesloth420: rightside of the pool  @Towelliee
[6:26:56] Rudric_Ice: Just make. tournament mode u can easily do it
[6:27:00] leeviate: thats what i was saying before if its built for that then go ahead and do a special  difficulty just for the racers shoot make the ending cutscene only unlockable when non racers beat the dungeon to so people dont feel like the ending is spoiled

[6:27:18] mmo_kenna_: Wouldn't be worth watching
[6:27:21] zuzus3petals: If they're creating fights that require massive real world resources to kill, how good is the wf race really? If you could have more people could compete, wouldn't that showcase more skills?
[6:27:27] KawaXIV: that would be better for the game
[6:27:33] KawaXIV: who cares how long the rwf guilds can do it
[6:27:38] KawaXIV: only their sponsors
[6:27:39] KawaXIV: OMEGALUL
[6:27:40] CAPT_Crack: classic cthun was killed in like 3 hours, that doesnt seem all that fun either
[6:27:46] Rotlung: Could do what they did for icc and decres hp by a % weekly or bi weekly
[6:27:52] zgag: WF race has always been more of a beta test for Blizzard
[6:27:57] Morhig: as a game developer you will never make everyone happy you have to find a happy medium
[6:27:59] Daggerstry: The simple solution is to allow no raid testing on PTR and as bugs happen once released, you fix them
[6:28:01] sleepywulfy: Is that what heroic serves?
[6:28:02] Eraste: yea. they cleared the savages in like a day, got their achievement, and went off the play other stuff. whats wrong with that? (dont mean to be a ff14 andie here)
[6:28:13] ijuki: @zuzus3petals The underlaying issue is that how gear is aquired
[6:28:30] cohesity: i dont think i could run split raids and play 16 to 17 hours a day
[6:28:35] Moobot: tigress75422, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!

[6:29:00] Eraste: wow = lost ark Kappa
[6:29:05] tigress75422: been that way for yrs now
[6:29:05] all_beef_franks: RWF is just the sponsor making those gamers act like slaves to be infront of the stream for 15 hours a day

[6:29:30] Eraste: ill definitely enjoy the race more if they can figure out how to greatly mitigate or remove the need for splits altogether
[6:29:34] weighties: @KawaXIV Because the Race is an  event it gets more eyes on the game and brings players back. THe average CE guilds take months to kill it anyway
[6:29:34] GiiGa07: Cap the ilvl, Call it Challenge Mode, and Tune it
[6:29:40] Affiiance: I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of people from Limit quit after this
[6:29:41] weighties: Post nerfs
[6:29:43] nemof09: Uh ok
[6:29:52] Casualcouchgamer: what two leggo's do you run for prot pally?
[6:30:12] zgag: Liquid going to need to change things up to compete with Echo. (For 1st).  Echo has clearly shown they are the better group winning the last 2 races.
[6:30:20] valianya: @towelliee if Blizzard made a temp server for RWF with gear vendors then It'd be accessible to way more guilds because they don't need to pay to gear up beforehand, and better work life balance cuz no need for splits
[6:30:31] KawaXIV: @spellton do you aspire to clear these raids? do you feel like there's a cap on the heights you can reach because the content in its hardest form is never available, even if you may never have a chance to clear it if it was available?
[6:30:59] KawaXIV: @spellton im arguing that even if that road is one most people will never reach the end of, its good for the game to have something that players can dream about and aspire for even if they'll never get there
[6:31:02] billybaggens: Masterloot fix alot of that problem?
[6:31:03] Specsifier: So glad I got all my "tame the rares as hunter pets" done pre-flying. It'd be so much harder to do that now
[6:31:04] caaayne: @zgag well not hard to win if the other team decides to take a break cause it took too long
[6:31:25] nemof09: Which add on do you use for rare tracking?
[6:31:41] Im_a_sad_man: What was the price pool in this season?
[6:31:43] Specsifier: Every time Blizzard gets control of competetive events, they kill them
[6:31:54] Eraste: that ^
[6:31:54] akia03: @nemof09 rare scanner tomcat tours handynotes
[6:31:59] leeviate: thats true what if they made mythic + versions of old raids that were timed then you could do a season of that to decide top guilds
[6:32:23] Yoitsnova: its not just time their players are infinitely better skillwise

[6:32:43] Texas_Mizfit: @Towelliee was the race longer cause the final 3 bosses were not on the ptr for liquid and echo to test
[6:32:56] weighties: @KawaXIV If had my time as a Mythic raider. Im old and a dad now.  Have I ever aspired to be A WFR yes. But I knew it would never happen. I dont expect blizzard to make the game easier so more people can try to reach a pipe dream.
[6:32:58] ProjectGrace_: They should keep what they’re doing and focus more on the community and create more content, collectible items etc etc. keep listening to wf guilds won’t help the game it’s just go sink the game even more. I hope blizz never sponsors/host rwf and stop listening to a such minority of ppl that play this game.
[6:33:01] cohesity: yep i cant go to work and ask for a month of to play wow
[6:33:01] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Echo are way better mechanical then Liquid
[6:33:13] Cyraxe_: Practically no one in this chat right now could play the game 12hrs+ a day for 3 weeks straight on the level needed for top 10 world.
[6:33:30] Eraste: @Texas_Mizfit not really. they lost 3-4 days to crab, and 8+ days to splits cause tier gear. blizz needs to fix loot first before anything else can get better

[6:33:53] N3llee: another bad take from twitch chat
[6:33:58] valianya: I've given up on doing Mythic when its current, just too hard to get into a group without paying
[6:34:00] treenation4: Lost ark actually respects my progression as opposed to resetting it every 6 months. Wow is so discouraging
[6:34:01] KawaXIV: @spellton part of being a fan of "esports" or w/e is having that pipe dream that it's at least possible if one could only get good enough. Not even having access to the same content as what you see on the stream means there's a peak before that which you can never get above, no?
[6:34:13] Eraste: ya, the non raid designers dont exist anymore KEKW
[6:34:14] mmo_kenna_: This RWF has been some of best content I've seen in years
[6:34:18] Everbliss: but overall its still payroll/resources. its not like one team never affects the other
[6:34:19] ProjectGrace_: I disagree
[6:34:21] Melgor101: LUL
[6:34:22] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @cyraxe_ if we are paid,everybody can learn and fo it
[6:34:25] zgag: @Towelliee Do you plan on streaming during the Xpac reveal
[6:34:34] swervity82: correct but all those teams have to work together because if each team did there own thing then the game would not flow from each part
[6:34:44] ProjectGrace_: I think one completely each other
[6:34:56] draxss: draxss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[6:35:06] Llamatude: wow is a raiding game.. end of story.. its always been and always will.
[6:35:06] Everbliss: but you have to think of it like instead of 15/15 it could be someething like 12/18
[6:35:09] InfamousMaverick: RWF is actually great for marketing, which is why Blizz tweets about it. Hell, even I who was on a break for about 6 months came back the last couple weeks because of RWF hype. This is why they tune and care about RWF
[6:35:10] leeviate: shit maybe thats the problem every department is acting on its own
[6:35:13] weighties: @KawaXIV  I have avenues to be a WF raider. I could dedicate more time to the game and climb up the ladder of top  until someone at the top notices me
[6:35:15] Aelissia: Teams are coordinated by leadership, always.
[6:35:16] treenation4: Silo team thinking great idea...
[6:35:27] WhosDisGuyy: Did you like the boss tuning and fights this tier?
[6:35:34] Specsifier: Some 2head thoughts getting put in chat KEKW
[6:35:36] Harskare: @Towelliee would it feel bad for the rest of the player base if they had shorter raids like 4-5 bosses but kept this difficulty?
[6:35:45] valianya: Blizzard needs separate teams just for overworld content
[6:35:52] swervity82: art
[6:35:54] Eraste: and thats why i dont play anymore lol
[6:35:55] akia03: was it just me or did the jailor walk around the room really wierdly like he did these wierd sprints
[6:35:58] spirantsix: Transmog
[6:35:58] mmo_kenna_: I commend blizzard for the bosses they have created to test these level of players. there is other difficulties for others
[6:36:04] ProjectGrace_: @swervity82 ty
[6:36:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Raid or die
[6:36:14] uglla3np: RAID sponsored stream
[6:36:14] Velashen: It goes back to the directors/leaders in that argument. If raiding is top tier and everything else is average something might be up.
[6:36:17] N3llee: did someone say raid?
[6:36:18] Maroleb: RAID
[6:36:19] fistofnature: pvp will be good in 10.0 Copium
[6:36:22] Colt_Engineer: Raid shadowlegends?
[6:36:26] Mr_Bradford_Gaming: But that would mean they would have to pay more people to work in the raid-only department and none of these "for our shareholders" companies are willing to spend that money.
[6:36:27] weighties: @KawaXIV The idea that anyone should be able to join a random guild and have a shot a winning the race is just plane silly. I dont expect Riot change their game to lay out a more straight forward plan for me to become a pro
[6:36:34] Maroleb: KEKW
[6:36:34] Im_a_sad_man: LUL
[6:36:34] zelik87: eyo youz name is Tony eh oh
[6:36:37] nemof09: I still like wows pvp lol
[6:36:39] CAPT_Crack: that's what happens when your pants are made of spikes
[6:36:39] Specsifier: Don't kink shame him @Towelliee
[6:36:41] Llamatude: @Towelliee are you kink shaming the jailer?
[6:36:42] Eraste: ya jailer model was jank AF
[6:36:46] donin: he was missing animations or something
[6:36:47] fistofnature: KEKW
[6:36:50] mmo_kenna_: Jailer animations were shite, the rest was fun to watch tho
[6:36:50] zgag: I personally don't see RWF race as good marketing. 99.99999% of the player base will never come close to that level of play. Good marketing is something more on the casual side
[6:36:52] Xanogames: im fucking choking food towelliee LUL
[6:36:57] KawaXIV: @spellton bruh i didnt say that, these things are inch by inch, day by day, but the point is that knowing that someday you can access the same content matters
[6:36:58] RacerDuke: He just had a cosmic enema?
[6:37:03] Secondbreakfasttt: @donin yeap
[6:37:17] michaelmm: We'd all walk funny if our soul was trying to animate a robot!
[6:37:44] Drew_Diligence: I came back to the game after quitting for 8 months because of the race
[6:37:45] vocalpenguin: it's very entertaining. i love being a neutral
[6:37:48] leeviate: i play cs everyday but dont expect to go pro and still have fun i can play wow and raid and not expect to do the top tier shit
[6:37:52] tebbix: I came back to WoW for example KEKW
[6:37:52] Llamatude: @Towelliee why do you think they called him the jailer.. wait till you see his sex dungeon.
[6:37:52] weighties: @KawaXIV Exactly and every player has that option work your way up the ladder and join a top guild if theyre good enough
[6:38:02] nemof09: Free marketing for blizzard
[6:38:02] dright424: Its great marketing plus its basically free marketing for them
[6:38:13] zgag: It would be better w/o all the splits.  If it was pure race format it would be better.
[6:38:18] sklingel: viewership down only cause over player base is down I think
[6:38:28] akia03: best thing about rwf you find new streamers to watch
[6:38:30] InfamousMaverick: Yup, I'm leveling my mage now because watching firedup was fun. I will never be at that level. But it is 100% great for marketing
[6:38:39] zgag: Split runs made it somewhat dull
[6:38:59] leeviate: whats splits lol?
[6:39:00] Eraste: ya, splits are awful
[6:39:08] KawaXIV: @spellton the top rung of the ladder gets removed when the raid gets patched
[6:39:11] Llamatude: I made 10mil gold off the splits from Liquid! 2 pieces of gear was given to them
[6:39:19] Llamatude: i loved the gear splits
[6:39:25] Corey13: Hey off topic, but you play a lot of games/mmo's how do you deal with trying to keep up with all of them?
[6:39:25] ProjectGrace_: But I respect your way to see. But I disagree. I think raiding and everything else in the game completely each other. Scoping only one thing it’s a bad take. And I hope they should stop listening too much 10% of the player base.
[6:39:35] Rudric_Ice: hows 9.2 ?
[6:39:36] SmuttBudgie: More splits than a vann damne movie
[6:39:39] Rudric_Ice: 3
[6:39:57] Moobot: Djfarmville, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[6:39:59] Apokolipz: WeSmart
[6:40:01] weighties: @KawaXIV No, thats just wrong lol  Its the same guilds in hall of fame every tier
[6:40:10] valianya: 99.9999% of players not only are not at RWF difficulty skill, but none ever even get a chance to try because the raids are massively nerfbat after RWF is over.  So RWF difficulty only exists for the race
[6:40:29] Fugazi811: no towelliee they don't people are dumb
[6:40:40] Zeke_nl: Liquid spent almost 723 million gold this tier….
[6:40:45] Gotxiko: but people told me on the internet that Ion does everything!
[6:40:49] weighties: @KawaXIV  Liquid gets players form the top 10 guilds the top 10 guilds get recruits from the 30 and so on
[6:40:49] plout0n: people can disagree without being dumb lol
[6:41:06] MeisterPetze: stfu bro.. you just need Kungen :D
[6:41:19] Specsifier: If you're in here crying about not being able to get to RWF level of gameplay, you already have given up trying to play at that level
[6:41:25] zelik87: would like to see few new BG's designed around SL
[6:41:26] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: 723 is like almost 3000 tokens
[6:41:38] TateyBread79: Kungen is the 1st boss
[6:41:40] zgag: Kungen already claimed WF 10.0
[6:41:46] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: 3000x$25 looool
[6:41:46] KawaXIV: @spellton you should watch "Analysis: The Need for Community" by Core-A Gaming - particularly the parts about clear paths
[6:41:53] Calphurnious: @zelik8798 Torghast bg?
[6:41:56] uglla3np: @Towelliee  opinions on 10.0 ?
[6:41:58] akia03: is ion still in elitst jerks?
[6:42:03] goblinfly99: what's up
[6:42:06] hunthutchy: kungen feels in his loins the upcoming boss abilities and needs no nameplates or timers
[6:42:10] Apokolipz: kungen is the final boss of wow
[6:42:16] Colt_Engineer: I GAMON WILL SAVE US
[6:42:20] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Joke a side butvwhere is Kungen?
[6:42:39] Apokolipz: i wish they would bring back gamon fights in org
[6:42:39] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[6:42:41] weighties: @KawaXIV Thinking BDDG isnt going to recruit an exceptional player because  their guild got CE post nerfs is just ridiculous
[6:42:49] tebbix: I don't think that WoW can get worse, well i hope 10.0 will be a positive thing
[6:43:03] leeviate: haste or critical strike for a prot pally
[6:43:03] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:43:05] uglla3np: kungen is bipolar
[6:43:07] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Back to Azeroth
[6:43:13] N3llee: and those gamer words got him
[6:43:25] Harskare: echo and liquid doing RWF is what Kungen's chilling looks like
[6:43:32] MeisterPetze: wasting all that good nihilus (or whatever) money :D
[6:43:36] CAPT_Crack: yup
[6:43:44] Im_a_sad_man: LUL

[6:44:14] ActuallyNico: Oh lawd, he knows LUL
[6:44:18] smiteyzzz: Asmongold said 10.0 will suck though
[6:44:24] Ezcotli: LOL
[6:44:25] Lotarion_: Lotarion_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[6:44:25] Specsifier: Towelliee being confident the next bit of content will actually be good is a good thing. Man knows his shit
[6:44:27] miloryeah: !wow10
[6:44:27] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Dont know but frlt Bfa was more fun to play and gaer up then Sl

[6:44:33] Shrenko: @smiteyzzz towStop towIt towStop towIt
[6:44:33] rambaldi00: @smiteyzzz pot stir
[6:44:33] MeisterPetze: World of Warcraft: Revenge of Ragnaros
[6:44:38] SensationalBanana: Asmongold thinks every expansion sucks because he sucks.
[6:44:39] Rudric_Ice: More SYSTEMS and Timegating LETS GOOO
[6:44:42] Zeke_nl: Kungen just appears at the end of every xpac claiming top 15 guild the fails completing +15 then quits before raid
[6:44:42] Gurtogg: KEKW
[6:44:43] blascotwitch: @smiteyzzz yeah wow asmongold haha

[6:44:59] Cjstyling: You also said shadowlands was gonna be good
[6:45:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: No one knows what 10.0 will be like
[6:45:01] Djfarmville: Was is artificer they couldnt kill?
[6:45:03] mattmasters96: thats because he is on alliance and refuses to come to the good side
[6:45:12] Armdel: Asmon became the very thing he swore to destroy, an LFR player
[6:45:15] gali5656: asmongold couldn't beat a wet paper bag raid boss
[6:45:19] Gurtogg: clipped and shipped to asmon
[6:45:20] brandroach2: clip that comment XD
[6:45:22] InfamousMaverick: Please just give me good player housing
[6:45:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even though they are working on 10.0 right now, I think during beta it can change a ton
[6:45:24] tebbix: I just want nice mogs and mounts
[6:45:26] CAPT_Crack: ion probably knows
[6:45:27] Shrenko: devs knows
[6:45:34] Djfarmville: kungen kows
[6:45:34] Zeke_nl: No one associates asmon with wow anymore
[6:45:38] Jewishraver: give me 2 new classes with 10.0 please!
[6:45:38] mmo_kenna_: how many did towelliee manage in his viewer pug on normal?
[6:45:47] Nokterian: currently enjoying lots of healing classes
[6:45:52] Nildaem: Wild take but the people developing 10.0 know what it's going to be
[6:45:52] Merex760: I know :)
[6:45:54] Eraste: i'll know if i even touch 10.0 way before it ever launches. if we get the same nonsense from blizz as before
[6:46:07] ashwing_: Are you ppl dumb if hes that confident he obviously knows LUL
[6:46:12] TheRukis: fuck it time gate the shit outta it that way i can have a job and still not get left behind from ppl who dont have to work, and or get payed to play.
[6:46:24] jridablo: but have you sloloed any boss in LA? he soloed every every boss in guardian raid
[6:46:38] c0mmander_starscream: 10.0 isn't being released until the Microsoft taveover is complete
[6:46:52] Rudric_Ice: the Next patch seems more interesting than this patch can't wait to play alliance back again
[6:46:54] zelik87: I'd also like to see them update graphics around old zones, some of them look very outdated
[6:47:01] ogstatus23: Man, I farmed for that mount for forever and never got it
[6:47:15] ogstatus23: I've quit now lol
[6:47:23] uglla3np: i cant wait for a modern wow classic lorewise
[6:47:30] uglla3np: 10.0 is gonne be humble
[6:47:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol Phil Spencer will save us, but it's going to take awhile
[6:47:32] nightmayor12: we wont see the new exspansion before next april.
[6:47:33] Gurtogg: since warcraft 3
[6:47:34] cschimp: Has the microsoft purchase even been approved? lol
[6:47:35] TateyBread79: Since WC3
[6:47:36] spirantsix: that makes me sad cause the current people in charge of wow are just killing it
[6:47:42] tigress75422: MS influence prob wont be till 11.0 til we really see their influence a bit
[6:47:56] WOOPsWOOP: i so god damn excited for the new expansion HYPEEEE
[6:47:56] Evcon_: i just want us to finally learn why every1 is after azeroth. whats so special about it
[6:47:59] theDirtyon3: i hate reddit chat LUL
[6:48:00] N3llee: it hasnt even gone through govt approval lol
[6:48:01] D3m0nHunt3r666: the real expansion start after that though Kappa
[6:48:01] solsaver12: I think 10.0 gonna take us back in time
[6:48:20] MaMad666: @Towelliee What will be the MS influences in the future?
[6:48:22] Harskare: after wrath classic?
[6:48:24] BlinkHeals: already did that with wod
[6:48:29] smiteyzzz: Your dog knows a dog at Blizzard
[6:48:30] rambaldi00: I would think doing a new raid blind with randoms from twitch is a recipe for disaster
[6:48:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't want to wait until 2023, but yeah with season 4 it's probably going to be then
[6:48:35] uglla3np: Q1 23 would mean beta at Q2 22
[6:48:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Spires of Ascension +15 Mythic Plus Key - Protection Paladin (Shadowlands Season 3) youtu.be/xQL7lmYnZ-Y

[6:48:58] theDirtyon3: we did it first week LUL
[6:49:20] dregusx: in the past asmon did too
[6:49:22] lightable855: @towelliee MS might not even have that big of an impact on 11.0  depending on when blizz starts early development
[6:49:27] Daggerstry: It isn't like Normal is hard. I saw the mechanics on the first wipe and got them down
[6:49:39] theDirtyon3: dont get me excited today
[6:49:40] Maroleb: so beta in september maybe?
[6:49:49] WOOPsWOOP: GONNA BE AWESOME
[6:49:51] InfamousMaverick: @Towelliee I'm cool to wait if the next expac is a banger.
[6:49:57] lithium364: there will also be an d4 update this week
[6:49:58] vocalpenguin: will wotlk classic be this year?
[6:50:09] Shrenko: HE KNOWS
[6:50:16] Jewishraver: i cant wait for wrath classic as long as i can stay frost dk
[6:50:17] brookzey69: I LOVED WRATH
[6:50:20] Jewishraver: and tank with it
[6:50:23] N3llee: I want to see some SoM shit in Wrath classic
[6:50:26] fistofnature: NAX OUT PogChamp
[6:50:27] WOOPsWOOP: lol
[6:50:28] tigress75422: 11.0 i think we will just see a lil bit of MS and 12.0 will be full blown under MS influence
[6:50:36] tebbix: @brooksey69 BatChest
[6:50:42] Apokolipz: to all the wrath classic  players : Suffer Well
[6:50:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they can get out Classic Wrath this year, it will help us get through the wait for 10.0
[6:50:49] Zerfell: They gonna make naxx not a joke in wotlk?
[6:50:55] Gurtogg: will you still know in the future with Lore gone now
[6:50:58] Jewishraver: for me wrath was peak wow
[6:51:18] lithium364: i dont think they can buff naxx enough for DKs not to stomp it
[6:51:25] VirenTV: Can they just do season of mastery from the beginning?
[6:51:42] t0csik: How long are they gone keep going with the Classic ??  We'll we have Classic Shadowlands at some point ??
[6:51:58] WOOPsWOOP: thank goodness!
[6:52:05] WOOPsWOOP: im hyped!
[6:52:05] droodics: can't wait for wrath classic
[6:52:10] bgod2500: they give a date for wrath classic?
[6:52:22] vocalpenguin: niiiiice
[6:52:23] sklingel: shadowmourne
[6:52:25] Armdel: wotlk launch being so pug friendly is what hooked me on raiding
[6:52:27] Eraste: ill probably not since i got no joy from the other two classics. no point giving it a third shot
[6:52:32] Gurtogg: m+ Pog
[6:52:33] VirenTV: Wrath is still really easy compared to modern raids. I really hope they tune them higher
[6:52:34] spekktrum19: Need MOP classic
[6:52:37] CAPT_Crack: DKs are levelboosted Pog
[6:52:37] Reizmaud: i enjoyed it once cant get the same feeling twice
[6:52:38] MeisterPetze: finaly farm invincible again :D
[6:52:45] lithium364: 1vs3 dk Arena BatChest unless the enemy is also an Dk BatChest

[6:52:56] theDirtyon3: bro....im getting a chubby stop please
[6:53:05] spirantsix: I would be excited if microsoft was more in charge of 10.0
[6:53:05] D3m0nHunt3r666: but wrath is wrath,,,
[6:53:05] Morpheusx25: @theDirtyon3 half-mast
[6:53:09] yankerzzz: when is wrath coming out?
[6:53:09] Eraste: @Towelliee you think the season 4 stuff may be the beginning of them adding in old content to max level (or a sync system)?
[6:53:14] tigress75422: not excited for 10.0 in the least msyelf
[6:53:15] Gurtogg: i want mop :(
[6:53:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: casual friendly Kappa
[6:53:16] KawaXIV: post-wrath do you think it's at all possible that blizzard starts taking an old-school runescape route where they develop new content in the design style of the era and send it down a different trajectory than what retail went?
[6:53:29] Frozen_DK: my first expac launch was wrath so i only have fond memories of that <3
[6:53:29] WOOPsWOOP: I had the most alts I've ever had in wrath
[6:53:30] tigress75422: would only come back for wrath classic tbh
[6:53:37] VirenTV: Wrath wasn't more casual lol. Tons of grind isn't difficult or "hardcore"
[6:53:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, in Wrath you could actually craft a whole set of decent armor...I loved that
[6:53:41] Eraste: see THAT has me interested in the game again, if they can get it done
[6:53:43] nitemare34godd: i bet classic wraith will add all forward exp to it as classic that is prob why we wont need no more classic's
[6:54:21] InfamousMaverick: Make it rewarding by giving cosmetics for player housing ;)
[6:54:30] MeisterPetze: remove the fuckin itemlevel grind with 10.0
[6:54:36] lithium364: the DK starting Area is still one of the best questing experiences to date
[6:54:38] Specsifier: very happy with the prot buffs
[6:54:41] Specsifier: its at least something
[6:54:57] fistofnature: The 3 people who still play it KEKW
