[0:08:53] HopeThePriest: So its been 3 weeks I've swapped of healing after like 18 years and mained VDH, BDK and Prot pally. Its the most fun I've ever had, how not stressful is tanking compared to healing. I will say though, there are alot of shitty healers in pugs, like errr mer gerd
[0:09:31] itsblaine: its the sound effects for me
[0:09:33] Mavetism: Just stand inside the melee hitbox and it doesnt do dmg

[0:12:30] nash25pl: well GL i guess i know you will get it killed
[0:12:38] majestictaco0: I feel that, we had a 0.02% wipe last night and a dh gquit after raid. Feeling great about it
[0:13:08] Nico_vdM: perhaps if the dh leeched more it could have been the kill
[0:13:44] nash25pl: our casual group had lots of no shows in past few weeks so main team decided to boost them on HC fryakk for curve felt nice that toxic players missed out on it

[0:17:58] alexxheartless: resto druid looks like fun but catweaving looks intimidating, can you explain why its necessary/when do swap into cat?
[0:19:17] davaIon: davaIon watched 15 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! ItsHappening
[0:23:42] Guffels: @alexxheartless necessary because its almost all your damage. you swap whenever you dont have to be healing. knowing when is the entire skill gap of the class
[0:24:47] Hambull: Yo JB, do you always use this talent setup or is it dung/affix specific?
[0:25:58] flawlesslykun: @Hambull u only go treeform for lvl 28 + keys according to a mate of mine. and not all dungeons
[0:25:59] Guffels: his talents change every key and he doesnt even bring the same set to the same dungeon. best way to see what he is running is checking his raider io
[0:26:07] ren0m: why no release?
[0:26:57] Hambull: Ty y'all

[0:58:13] ViveColasBim: i doubt also
[0:58:42] ViveColasBim: very cosy lives

[0:59:13] dotbotter: wierdge
[0:59:23] ren0m: Galkarond's fall might be my least favourite dungeon
[0:59:37] ren0m: Because of that beyblade boss
[1:00:40] sw0ngs: @ren0m the second one?
[1:00:41] ren0m: It's tough to keep track where people are standing
[1:01:01] ren0m: @sw0ngs yes
[1:01:20] dragona92: I also dislike Iridikron
[1:01:27] lazy_marathoner: so... odd question, how much do you swap out trinkets for different dungeons/key levels?
[1:01:45] ren0m: What's your favourite fountain to run around?
[1:01:46] ren0m: All time
[1:02:18] ren0m: Dalaran fountain looks good, but it's small, so it wasn't that popular I think.
[1:02:41] Bmatt326: hey mr jdot been watching you since I started my journey in legion and now doing my first 25s thanks for the inspiration !

[1:08:06] PrimeaeTV: do you ever struggle to keep your head perfectly centered in the frame or is it second nature to you by now
[1:09:33] PrimeaeTV: my cam is so wide, throughout the key i lean forward more and more
[1:09:37] PrimeaeTV: as i enter shrimp mode
[1:09:55] ren0m: Do you exclusively heal?
[1:10:28] PrimeaeTV: i should do that, forced posture check
[1:12:06] ren0m: Is there such a big difference?
[1:12:09] ren0m: from 27 to 29
[1:12:54] ren0m: But things that would one-shot you in 29 also one-shot you in 27, no?

[1:41:09] ren0m: Just as I asked
[1:41:14] luxumbra69: it's basically a non issue
[1:42:10] xHILDAx: oooof thats not worth it imo
[1:42:41] Webchika: That's how it worked when my TV stopped working
[1:42:44] xHILDAx: what if they do not have it on stock?
[1:42:45] Xastin3: i dont have faith in that
[1:42:52] Webchika: Because I had the Best  Buy protection it was just an exchange
[1:43:18] flawlesslykun: @jdotb u going for 32" ?
[1:43:23] laedine: Did you finish the key?
[1:43:24] flawlesslykun: that's the new sweet spot imo
[1:43:35] flawlesslykun: if u going 4k OLED i mean
[1:44:10] xHILDAx: feels kinda weird being in the EU hearing you talk about all these extra shit.  We have 2 years warranty no questions asked if its indeed broken.  Though generally its the MSI way of doing things and you have to send it to get checked first.
[1:45:39] Broastbeef: You'll be without it. You can exchange it if they have it in stock, otherwise they process the exchange and order it for you. However, if there is a store near you that has it, they can set up the order for you to go there and pick it up that day. -Source: I work there
[1:45:48] flawlesslykun: YEP the 1st one announced was from asus. and i fucking want that so bad if it wasnt so goddam expensive
[1:46:45] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:46:49] flawlesslykun: this is exactly why i'd love to live in the states man.... monitors, GPU's, everything is so absurd in terms of prices here in Portugal where i live
[1:46:49] BradIey: i've heard burned in monitor more times in the last 5 minutes than i have in my entire life
[1:48:09] Webchika: I need to buy new monitors... but I can't decide if I want to stick with curved monitors or go back to regular flat ones
[1:48:37] Broastbeef: Correct. It's to eliminate shrink. Depending on the store some GSM's or GM's will allow you keep yours until the new one arrives and then good faith swap it, but that's rare now. Also, let's say it's 2 years out and that model doesn't exist anymore. The price you paid for the previous one goes towards the new monitor of your choice if your old model is no longer around.
[1:50:07] Webchika: I had 2 curved 24in monitors ... but right now I have 1 flat 1 curved (was supposed to be 2 flat but 1 broke lol)
[1:50:28] Miltrath: Curved monitors exist only to compensate for VA viewing angles
[1:53:20] Broastbeef: It varies per product and price. Anywhere from 2-4 years. There's also another option they have called Best Buy Total, but that's far to difficult to discuss through a small box and better for them to tell you.
[1:53:39] Broastbeef: Yes, we have people do that all the time
[1:53:46] Webchika: Not monitor related... but have to share that Challah Bread, toasted with Cream Cheese is better than bagels (they're almost the same thing lol)
[1:53:54] Broastbeef: As long as you stay within the return policy, there is no fault as long as it's not damaged.
[1:53:54] Webchika: Probably with a restocking fee
[1:54:00] Broastbeef: No restocking fee
[1:54:28] Broastbeef: you're not, most of us managers will recommend that as your solution.
[1:54:41] Broastbeef: It's common practice and it'll never be negative to you.
[1:55:53] markoleptic_: yeah some
[1:55:57] Webchika: I think it depends on the store? I would think so though
[1:56:02] Broastbeef: Depends on the store. If the store is "Hub" store then yes, but if it's not a "Hub" store then it's a 50/50 chance. If you go to the website and search the model you're looking for, it'll say "On Display at X store"

[2:12:25] ren0m: Do they even check them?
[2:12:32] ren0m: Or other substances like it
[2:13:01] ren0m: I guess they don't test you then
[2:13:43] dithrica: idk why they would, seems like a waste of money + it's not really on the level of like, steroids in traditional sports as far as advantage I'd imagine?
[2:14:08] ren0m: It must help
[2:14:18] Webchika: @dithrica Lol I didn't think I could have it because I could sit and read for hours... Diagnoses at 35 or 36 lol and now paying for the joy of meds to balance my brain out
[2:15:17] unicornqqlol: whats up jdot
[2:15:19] dithrica: @webchika literally my therapist asked me if I'd been tested before and I was like no but I don't have trouble focusing, I can read a book for 12 hours straight and she was like yeaaaah...lol. 33, first time anyone has mentioned it to me
[2:15:31] HikikomoriiX: maybe a dumb/rando q but how do you have your twitch chat on your stream? :3 is it a specific overlay or something?
[2:15:50] toastbam: honestly, as a person who has tons of experience with steroids and adderall, those are not comparable. Steroids dont alter your immediate focus. Adderall would really only be beneficial to someone who needs it or someone who has built a tolerance for it and cant function without it.

[2:23:38] Webchika: @dithrica I saw something saying that when looking at scans of ADHD brains, a Boy with ADHD shows an "abnormal brain", a Girl with ADHD's brain looks like a Typical Boy's brain... and since the base line for most scans is the male version /sigh
[2:25:36] Rypick: wonder if this will effect death rolls
[2:25:44] Whitewolf1441: oh this is just classic..............
[2:26:08] dithrica: @webchika doesn't surprise me at all lol.
[2:26:08] Whitewolf1441: theyre intentionally keeping it vague
[2:26:34] frazlord: People are getting tons of gold rolling for things like suncaller in heroic raids right now
[2:26:50] devilhawk83: I got a feeling it will eventually come to retail, just that they are testing it in SoD first
[2:26:56] flawlesslykun: @jdotb it's kinda hilarious that they were supposed to ban ppl offering boosts on trade channel (since there is a channel for that sort of garbage now) and everyday the same mf's are there spamming
[2:27:33] s_dawg1: They need to have it so if you roll on an item its just bound to you if you win
[2:27:42] dithrica: I paid 250k for heroic nymue staff then got iridal's two weeks later 🙂
[2:28:07] Webchika: @dithrica If you're on meds for ADHD one thing to keep an eye on is your meds effectiveness will vary depending on where you are in your cycle. And they're only now starting research the effects of varying estrogen levels on ADHD
[2:28:17] flawlesslykun: it's even more hilarious that the options for reporting a person are literaly - advertizing, spamming, text chat, etc
[2:28:39] flawlesslykun: i hope microsoft fired some of the deadweight GM's ngl KEKW
[2:29:27] dithrica: @webchika just on Wellbutrin, waiting time rn is months 😤 but that's good to know. as if it didn't suck enough lol
[2:29:37] devilhawk83: My worry is that people will find workarounds to circumvent it
[2:30:03] frazlord: @flawlesslykun yay someone lost their livelihood! They suck!

[2:31:28] monntuu: accounts be dishing it out
[2:31:39] devilhawk83: I can see elixirs and other materials being uses as “currency” like how Divine Orbs, Chaos Orbs and other items are part of the currency in Path of Exile
[2:31:41] JmantheThief: this is a good idea to start doing, thanks! /s
[2:31:58] flawlesslykun: @frazlord brother... have u even played wow since legion ended ? because news flash - they do suck. dragonflight is the 1st expac that is decent since then. Don't feel sorry for paying wages of literal deadweight
[2:32:13] grieze: what likely prompted this is a blizz employee losing an item this way
[2:32:27] Webchika: @dithrica I got really lucky was a Cerebral patient for a bit and when they stopped prescribing a lot of meds I'd been paired with a doc who had an existing  practice that he was willing to absorb patients into.  Because by that point I'd been on Wellbutrin and hadn't gotten any results... ended up on Adderall and then with the shortages ended up on Vyvannse which I've liked the best it's just ass expensive even with the new generic
[2:33:16] Webchika: If they pull this over into retail I wonder how this would end up effecting the guilds who sell Heroic Raid Runs / M+ Runs
[2:33:17] devilhawk83: konazbSad That would be painful
[2:33:43] frazlord: @flawlesslykun imagine hoping someone loses their job because of the handcuffs management puts on them. That's like walking into McDonalds and hoping the cashier gets fired for using the cheapest ingredients.   If a GM did something above and beyond, it was likely going against what they were supposed to do in their standard procedures.
[2:33:45] dithrica: @webchika yeah I've heard good things about Vyvanse, that it's "smoother" relative to Adderall. the Wellbutrin helps enough, but also man, the rage issues are no joke
[2:33:52] yarpx: how have you been liking tranq?
[2:34:07] frazlord: @flawlesslykun look beyond someones name in chat and have compassion for people that lost their income
[2:34:14] Webchika: Is that an add on that shows your talents like that when you hover over different builds? Or is that just Elvui?
[2:35:13] Noxiirea: why not take reforestation then?
[2:35:27] Disc0love: dk can control undead no?
[2:35:27] totalecl1pse_: just leave
[2:35:27] Wheysted779: DK can
[2:35:33] kngcoi: dk doesnt have dominate mind or w/e its called?
[2:35:33] frazlord: @flawlesslykun and if you think it's going to be better in the long term, it won't. They are outsourcing all the CS and GM work.
[2:35:37] hipposlam: DK can only if they are frost
[2:35:40] totalecl1pse_: not if hes unholy
[2:35:42] hipposlam: if they are unholy they cant

[2:36:20] Webchika: @dithrica I was having really nasty Med Drop off on Adderall even with the Extended release. And Vyvannse is 12hr extended release by default. And yah the mood swings can 100% suck...I feel bad but I have days where I end up in  my car driving around just so my dogs can't touch me because it's too much

[2:37:45] Webchika: @dithrica If you're noise sensitive I've heard really good things about the Loop Earplugs. They supposedly dampen sound just enough without blocking conversations
[2:38:11] Webchika: Is there a command for a list of your current addons?
[2:38:56] dithrica: @webchika hah I am, I've just been snapping at my coworkers whenever they start talking super loud 😅 I'll check them out lol

[2:39:14] Webchika: @flowerpwrxd Thank you
[2:40:16] Webchika: @jdotb Thank you! I actually caught the name of the one I think I was looking for lol... The Talent Tree Threads... if it is the one I think it was it looks pretty useful and cool
[2:40:55] Webchika: Or I guess it's Talent Tree Tweaks rather than threads lol
[2:44:22] yarpx: that glitch is patched
[2:44:34] yarpx: you use to be able to get gnarlroot out of the arena and he would never get his orbs

[2:44:46] MicHawkh: ye this tech is over (fun detected blizzard)
[2:45:57] MicHawkh: gg
[2:46:06] devilhawk83: chrysLUL
[2:47:56] flawlesslykun: @frazlord i was afk. Dude this might sound a bit arrogant i guess, but why would i show compassion to a game that i pay to play in 2024 ? I do i need to act like it's all sunshine and rainbows, while i pay to stare at group finder and pug with ppl that are just as toxic if not more toxic than me (when i do manage to get an invite), and GM's do nothing to actively punish those ppl ? i genuinely do not understand why ppl keep simping for blizzard at this point
[2:48:24] flawlesslykun: there's a reason why microsoft fired ppl, and we all know that there are a lot of deadweight inside blizzard
[2:49:15] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:49:58] hipposlam: the DKS pet are on passive
[2:50:38] frazlord: @flawlesslykun where did I say show compassion to the company? Blizzard or Microsoft? I said celebrating 1900 people losing their income because the "deadweight GMs", who are just following the procedures they are given, is kind of a dick move. If you don't want to support the company, unsub and move on with your life.
[2:50:57] frazlord: Literally no simping for blizzard or microsoft to be seen.
[2:52:21] frazlord: Also don't blame the company if you can't get invited to keys lol
[2:52:25] stylee__: is it WA that shows the CCs?
[2:52:28] 253templar: pugging a 29 EB is crazy LUL
[2:52:40] flawlesslykun: see but that's the thing, and i literaly just said it earlier @frazlord when u right click a person in game, the options are report for - advertizing, boosting/deranking, spamming, text chat. Why do everyday that i log on to this game, i see ppl doing all of those things, advertizing in trade chat ?
[2:52:55] flawlesslykun: is that not the definition of deadweight ?
[2:53:00] Darkelment: they make new accs LUL
[2:53:12] flawlesslykun: don't those GM's need to start banning these ppl ?
[2:53:25] Darkelment: and they make new accs....
[2:53:27] s_dawg1: DK mind control right?
[2:53:41] Capt_MAD: Am I on a different week? I have  Entangle and Bursting
[2:54:00] flawlesslykun: @Darkelment i know they do mate ! that's exactly why they need to fucking perma ban these ppl. let them spend more money buying new accounts, and get those banned too
[2:54:08] flawlesslykun: it's the only way things will change, and things need to change
[2:54:20] Darkelment: you know they use stolen information and make new accs...
[2:54:40] Shkafche: whats the verdict on tree form vs convoke ? is it by dungeon, or key lvl ?
[2:55:09] frazlord: @flawlesslykun do you think the lowly GM is the one who decides when someone is banned? Once again, it's the company policy that is the problem not necessarily the discretion of a single GM
[2:56:08] JmantheThief: that's broodkeeper

[2:56:27] Calair_: That's just me on every fight
[2:56:27] The_Loony_Bin: council?
[2:56:31] Richadin: FYRAKK
[2:56:51] DrMeat: is it only active raid fights or anything in logs history?
[2:56:53] flawlesslykun: @Darkelment i will say it again, not taking action (by not perma banning those ppl) is essentialy allowing it to happen. idc if they make a new account and spend money on a new account, just start banning, and the spamming on trade chat will stop. ez gg it's literaly that simple
[2:57:13] Darkelment: did you not understand they make new acccs after they get banned

[2:57:42] Calair_: You'd see straight lines for the knocks on zskarn right?
[2:57:54] butter51: the council in 2nd tier? can't remember either name
[2:58:31] flawlesslykun: @frazlord i think they do most of their work based on standarts and saved replies like u were saying, following company policy (the knowledge base how to deal with issues, ik since i worked at phone support for ubereats, and it's probably the exact same). that being said, the amount of ppl spamming that do not get punished, means GM's are doing a very bad job. there is no way a person gets like 100 reports a day and keeps doing the exact same everyday without consequences
[2:58:39] codatv: Could be primal council
[2:59:08] Calair_: Diurna you had the add groups going around the edge, so you'd also see a distinct group for that
[2:59:31] frazlord: @flawlesslykun install Bad Boy, add some keywords to the block list and enjoy sitting in group finder without seeing the spam
[2:59:31] yellzz: idk looks like gnarlroot
[3:00:03] Suggoll: hes right in the middle bro
[3:00:38] flawlesslykun: @Darkelment idc how can u still not understand what i'm saying. the problem is not bots making new accounts, it's blizzard not banning them friend. oh they made a new one ? cool ban that one too. u legit cannot tell me that even twitch has a way to blacklist some words, and blizzard a multi-billion dollar company can't make the exact same thing to deal with this issue
[3:00:58] Calair_: Fyrakk is a reasonable shout. Theres one of those maps that looks like his platform, and the far-out paths would be tornado drops
[3:01:36] Calair_: Like if you look at he replies for Painted Dogs and Reko guilds
[3:01:50] Roadskii: Roadskii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Good day to you, sir.
[3:02:01] Calair_: P3 Tornado
[3:02:04] frazlord: @jdotb dropping tornados
[3:02:26] flawlesslykun: @frazlord that's a whole other conversation, but i'll indulge you. So i'm asked to pay 15 dollars a month to play world of warcraft, and i'm also asked to install addons that allow me to sit in valdraken and not see walls of text of boost sales ? this sounds perfectly acceptable and fine to you ?
[3:02:31] Calair_: I don't know if its north/south oriented to be fair
[3:02:38] DrMeat: cool game though
[3:03:04] bitterolgoat: bitterolgoat subscribed with Prime. 
[3:03:17] frazlord: @flawlesslykun different conversation totally. Leave the services channel. It was literally made for that. Boosting isn't against ToS.
[3:03:44] flawlesslykun: BUT THATS WHAT IM SAYING DUDE. it's not the services channel im bitching about, ITS TRADE CHAT
[3:04:32] frazlord: If I'm going to be honest, you sound like a pretty bitter and miserable person.
[3:05:00] frazlord: Leave Trade chat. How often do you need it? Once every 2 weeks to craft a piece.
[3:05:15] frazlord: So many easy workarounds to not be so worked up like this.
[3:05:16] flawlesslykun: lmfao. ok friend with that answer i can already tell u sell boosts so i'm just gonna stop the conversation here. Happy sales and fuck off with the judgement if u can't have a conversation
[3:05:18] flawlesslykun: cba
[3:05:37] frazlord: not your friend, pal
[3:05:54] flawlesslykun: cool be quiet and enjoy jb then.
[3:06:09] Darkelment: literally everyone that's decent sells boost xd
[3:06:37] frazlord: Why would I not sell boosts. It's easy gold
[3:06:51] frazlord: People out there buy 18s
[3:07:23] flawlesslykun: i love how ppl are literaly deaf to logic when they have interests in a conversation. the irony is just *chef's kiss*
[3:07:48] flawlesslykun: we all get spammed because of your easy gold while paying a sub to play this game. and it's all fine in your head
[3:07:51] flawlesslykun: keep that energy bud
[3:08:11] yellzz: @flawlesslykun i dont get spammed at all, turned off that channel and never felt the need to use it

[3:20:16] lunastar2s: thoughts on Budding Leaves vs Reforestation talent jb?
[3:20:17] DrMeat: i setup smart home motion detection lights all over my place and i forget people still use primitive light switches
[3:20:43] lunastar2s: and why reduced Irobark cd instead of Cultivation?
[3:20:45] Rypick: dont forget to claim yourcrackers pet boys and girls
[3:21:44] lunastar2s: not worth pressing not even for the mastery stack for increased healing?
[3:22:32] DrDucleus: WutFace
[3:22:34] WytherOK: I'm a big fan of the smart plugs I have, being able to turn on/off my lamps near my bad or my daughter's closet is awesome
[3:22:36] Dreadscore: true.
[3:22:40] Gaemer: Smoke detectors at least would save lives, maaaan
[3:22:42] WytherOK: bed*
[3:22:46] Dreadscore: we have nose. we smell smoke
[3:22:46] Webchika: I have Smart Smoke Detectors that tie into my Alarm system so they automatically call the fire department
[3:22:50] Dreadscore: we will live
[3:22:56] lunastar2s: not worth pressing rejuv not even for the mastery stack for increased healing?
[3:23:00] twitchcaneatmycheeks: tell her she can buy them with her money lol
[3:23:14] Raethus_WoW: simple smoke detectors are cheap, advanced ones are rather costly yeah
[3:23:21] DrMeat: lol thats a bit much, all they really would do is show you battery levels and tell ur app if they are going off when ur not home, which at that point wtf u gona do
[3:24:02] Gaemer: @DrMeat They aren't connected to security and fire dept.??? wtf
[3:24:06] WytherOK: for that cost you could setup a camera system in your home with audio
[3:24:18] WytherOK: so then you could check that shit with your cameras
[3:25:12] Webchika: If you have an Alarm System / Monitoring check if that company  offers them for sale... if they do they'll probably tie into your monitoring and be less that $700
[3:25:19] Webchika: well depending on the number you need
[3:25:56] Godsban3: they are officially killing overwatch
[3:26:09] DrMeat: depends on brand, the whole smart home industry have a lot of brands that want you to get locked into THEIR ecosystem so you have to buy there shit. I try to buy things that work with opensource software so if a company goes under my shit can still work
[3:26:16] Webchika: I wish I was less surprised... I think the number I heard was that they  had to lay off like 1900 people company wide
[3:26:31] Gaemer: The ones at our place goes off, the security will call me up and make sure I'm home, if not- connects me to fire dept. And all with insurance and stuff.

[3:28:46] DrMeat: maybe they are culling to start with more of clean slate after the merger?
[3:28:57] Webchika: If WoW Esports are the only ones who survived you have to wonder if they're only going to survive thru the current tournaments
[3:31:22] Webchika: I wonder if Microsoft is going to try to merge everything into existing esports divisions... I'm not familiar enough with esports to know if Halo has an esports division (I would assume?) and try to have the same group handle them all (Halo, Cod, OW, WoW, Etc) as a cost saving measure even though not every esports division is the same
[3:31:27] ren0m: Maybe if they fire the affix guys we won't have any more affixes?
[3:31:54] ren0m: Halo does have HCS (league)
[3:32:04] ren0m: It's not that popular outside of the US though
[3:32:08] ren0m: Like CoD
[3:32:13] DrMeat: i mean shits nuts in VG industry right now, we are up to 60% of total layoffs from 2023 already and its not even feb yet
[3:32:17] Bug_Byte: i bet their Rumble mobile game didnt get any layoffs KEKL
[3:32:52] ren0m: Blizz does make most of its money from Candy Crush
[3:33:03] ren0m: So there's that
[3:34:57] ren0m: OWL was terrible in recent years
[3:34:59] ren0m: VIewers-wise
[3:35:24] ren0m: There were some speculations that Blizz botted viewers for OWL.
[3:35:49] ren0m: OWL disbanded because the teams didn't want to be in.
[3:36:13] ren0m: Also FACEIT is now working with Blizz on Overwatch

[3:36:56] Webchika: I wonder if maybe the remaining members are mix of WoW & CoD esports employees... and they're going to try to have the esports employees join with microsoft esports employees to be "universal" rather than game specific... It's something I could see Upper Management thinking is a good idea
[3:37:02] ren0m: besides the three LAN events

[3:37:33] Orgabism: Question: Why are we here?
[3:37:44] ren0m: We haven't figured that out yet
[3:38:30] ren0m: They should just let third-party organisers host the events
[3:38:31] ren0m: Like CS
[3:39:04] Webchika: Bliz did that with their music department for wow... It made me sad but it hasn't seemed to effect the actual in game music so I guess it worked out
[3:39:28] Webchika: But then I'm a band nerd lol so I always like finding out about in house music creation and such lol
[3:40:04] ren0m: First SC died

[3:40:29] ren0m: Blizz has quite a record in esports
[3:40:48] ren0m: MDI IEM Katowice 2026?
[3:41:13] Webchika: All the layoffs and just the general last couple years make me glad I didn't end up getting the  job with Bliz when I was applying for their Travel Coordinator position lol... Would have loved it but I doubt that position would have survived even the Covid Layoffs
[3:41:45] ren0m: Overwatch will come back, but on FACEIT. Not entirely dead, but the franchise model didn't work out.
[3:42:23] Webchika: I just realized... We keep talking about OWL but doesn't Hearthstone also have an esports league of some sort?
[3:42:59] ren0m: After cat videos
[3:43:02] Webchika: @perkkuheppu Hopefully you don't live in one of the areas that Pornhub & other such sites have now blocked due to state regulations prohibiting access to online porn
[3:44:00] ren0m: It does
