[0:17:03] Drustankavu: @blackmanrung tip: don't play as brewmaster
[0:19:53] Standy94: Why did they include King's Rest for S4? Such a garbage pick
[0:20:21] Guffels: no way thats confirmed right?
[0:21:25] jesustakethewheels: it is confirmed, King Rest is in S4
[0:22:10] Demazia: link?
[0:23:33] waelrick: wow, yoda's group did a 32 waycrest
[0:23:42] Whitewolf1441: @waelrick wow
[0:24:14] jesustakethewheels: @Demazia Season 4 King Rest: http://tinyurl.com/3662wuej
[0:24:31] Standy94: It's pretty easy to do WM now  with the bug on the tree boss
[0:24:58] Demazia: @jesustakethewheels can already tell this aint legit \
[0:25:06] Demazia: LUL
[0:25:07] treavorthenusance: @Standy94 whats the bug?
[0:25:21] Standy94: With Aug you can snap him into the basement and he uses no abilities
[0:25:36] jesustakethewheels: but they didnt run Aug
[0:25:39] jesustakethewheels: so that makes 0 sense
[0:25:49] Standy94: maybe they found a way with another class
[0:25:57] waelrick: @Standy94 theyre the only ones that have done a 32 and they didnt have an aug
[0:25:57] worthtv: They didn't use any bug
[0:25:59] jesustakethewheels: they literally stream it, there was no bug

[0:26:23] jesustakethewheels: legit spreading fake information "they must have used another class to bug WM"
[0:26:30] jesustakethewheels: you can literally watch their stream
[0:26:39] Standy94: They probably just ran the WM in a King's Rest
[0:26:40] spam_4head: I heard they hired Russian hackers to help them beat the WM 32

[3:22:04] Aroty: It should stay dead
[3:24:12] Aroty: @pichuux affixes could be ok, but the current system sucks. There are weeks where they just don't make sense to even push. Increasing the difficulty is good, this system is bad.

[5:02:34] WingedChipmunk: @brotan123 LMFAO modern problems require past problems for solutions

[5:05:14] DieNivea: @jdotb hey hey this might sound stupid ... but do you have any advice for a push group which is getting tilte cause of depleating and after one depleat and cause of being tilt depleating the runs after as well
[5:05:30] brotan123: harsh, you are off the job for half a year and now the CV goes right into the bin Kappa
[5:05:47] caradea_: @DieNivea accept that you will deplete the majority of your runs
[5:05:48] professor_cullman: would you do it again now?
[5:06:26] mendeln333: isn't i sweden now`?
[5:06:30] mendeln333: it

[5:11:33] sw0ngs: non verbal
[5:13:04] itsparvati: its just points its not love
[5:13:14] DadBodGeoff: very very good points. exactly how I felt the other night
[5:13:22] WingedChipmunk: Agreed that IO is not a good base for "Skill" since that score is also dependent on 4 other people playing perfectly
[5:13:25] Fortvila: word
[5:13:48] Fortvila: would love if M+ didnt scale dmg past 20, but instead increase HP and reduce time
[5:14:17] WingedChipmunk: @Fortvila i feel like 20 would be TOOO easy, it would definitely need to be a higher level
[5:14:52] WingedChipmunk: this season you outgear 20's at 460~ where it feels like a normal key
[5:15:11] caradea_: i have picked up other hobbies that i'm not very good at rn
[5:15:15] caradea_: so i kinda got used to it
[5:16:08] itsparvati: too many IO snobs out there
[5:16:29] itsparvati: pushing keys to max is not the only "right" way to play wow
[5:16:31] caradea_: ah dont get me wrong, i'm trying for the title. i just dont get worked up about depletes
[5:16:41] DadBodGeoff: @WingedChipmunk The average player 1000% struggles in a 20 at 460 ilvl..
[5:18:35] itsparvati: its a bit of old wow view, dungeons were for fun, raids were for challenge
[5:19:05] bschs1: @jdotb if you could change how keys work, what would u do??
[5:19:50] dragona92: @itsparvati Parvati from Harry Potter? KEKW
[5:20:28] itsparvati: @itsparvati no from religion
[5:20:56] Graphyti: is there a specific point on m+ rating for where the average player gets hard stuck at? such that I mean in comparison of other games where players might get stuck at a certain rank until they get a team and experience to play the right way
[5:21:32] MicHawkh: So its like raiding got it
[5:22:10] Graphyti: damn, 4 ads after I asked a question
[5:22:12] WingedChipmunk: @DadBodGeoff yes but i dont think lower the skill ceiling would be a good thing. having a bit higher of a skill ceiling allows for multiple skill levels to have their "Challenge" spot
[5:24:01] itsparvati: so much of pushing to high end of key level is friends
[5:25:07] itsparvati: i did one of those, the tank is very special needs
[5:25:19] brotan123: followers? you mean the NPCs blizz added? KEKW
[5:25:42] brotan123: they should add these for up to +20 please mr blizz
[5:26:29] itsparvati: @brotan123 i would do those to just stand back and watch the AI try
[5:26:38] kurtis_f: wonder how high a follower key could be pushed
[5:26:44] Hayotal: Difficulty decreases by a certain ammount by just having voice comms imo
[5:27:05] FuruF: You can just group with hunters, and get the same experience as playing with followers :)
[5:27:18] itsparvati: thats rough
[5:29:11] DadBodGeoff: @WingedChipmunk I dont think the skill level should be changed on keys at all. Thats whats cool by infiite scale content. Some people time 15s, some do 20s others do 30+ theres content for each skill levl. Its not meant for all

[5:31:25] Silentfeety: Why rdruids go for crit now in m+
[5:32:22] FuruF: Damage
[5:32:24] reippailija: more damageeee
[5:32:27] itsparvati: crit works for both dps and healing, mastery does nothing for dps
[5:33:03] reippailija: resto dps benefits most from crit
[5:34:03] kurewax9: Oh nice. Tennessee is a nice place would love to experience it some day

[5:39:09] reippailija: whats going on
[5:39:22] reippailija: maaan
[5:56:09] WingedChipmunk: @DadBodGeoff well it's not that, the current scaling is VERY bad. You can have the damage to time keys with minutes to spare but you just cant survive the the hits in turn. The counter to this that JB pitched was to cap the keys at 25~ and then start reducing the time. This results in a set balancing for damage, creates more viable classes where survivability is not as big an issue and makes balancing these dungeons a bit more balanced and even then some being significantly easier than others.
[5:59:16] kelly_mac06: yea it's not a skill capped issue
[5:59:26] kelly_mac06: it's a "we can't fucking live one hit" issue
[6:01:08] Whitewolf1441: this is not a 29 everbloom
[6:01:10] KembriaTV: They could also just not cap key levels and just cap the damage increases from mobs/bosses at a certain key level and only have the health go up after that point
[6:01:23] KembriaTV: That would still require better tuning
[6:01:26] Whitewolf1441: @KembriaTV oh good idea
[6:01:43] Whitewolf1441: correct me if im wrong but keys dont have a steady increase in % right?

[6:03:30] s_dawg1: Did you guys get score today or was all of those BRH just for funsies
[6:03:44] KembriaTV: @Whitewolf1441 That depends on what you mean. It goes up by about 10% per key level, but the difference is absolutely speaking going to become bigger the higher you go
[6:04:40] Whitewolf1441: @KembriaTV oh so it is 10% each key? ok

[6:05:21] Appl3man: do you only run invigorate for yazma?
[6:05:56] Ark_Temper: @kelly_mac06 Keep in mind that they nerfed this because of the god comp in S2.
[6:06:04] Ark_Temper: Not sure if they reverted that nerf coming into S3.

[6:08:55] kelly_mac06: but ye no idea if it was reverted after s2
[6:08:59] Lara_TV_: 1.25m each??
[6:09:36] maneatingpotato1: @Lara_TV_ Probably.  Probaly cost 5M for the boost
[6:09:36] WingedChipmunk: @Ark_Temper do believe you are correct and that was reverted the start of this season
[6:09:52] Ark_Temper: @Ark_Temper Cross-Realm farming groups.
[6:09:55] MicHawkh: Invigorate in which dungeon?
[6:10:02] Ark_Temper: Ooops didn't mean to reply with that.
[6:10:26] KembriaTV: @Ark_Temper On the contrary. It's actually a steeper scaling than what was just linked. That's old data
[6:10:33] flowerpwrxd: what do u hope to see in the vault tomorrow, big dog?
[6:10:46] kelly_mac06: @KembriaTV do you have updated scaling info
[6:10:58] kelly_mac06: im honestly curious, was talking about it the other day with my key group
[6:11:05] Icecoldeskilzz: u think 3650 will be enough for title this season when cuttoff atm is 3613?
[6:12:00] alur88: after mdi it will be 3,7

[6:12:07] Lara_TV_: I think it also depends whether 10.2.6/7 adds some weird power increase
[6:12:29] Fortvila: iwsh 10.2.6 adds catchp on crests

[6:13:02] KembriaTV: It's based on the lower end of the top 0.1%; so depending on how many people will still jump in, that might not go up by much (because of this)
[6:13:14] KembriaTV: @kelly_mac06 Sent you a DM
[6:13:19] solidsnake740: who paid you to heal that key?
