[1:24:50] Scarhearth: frothing berserker for prot is gonna be nuts
[1:25:02] Tendag: warrior talent tree is looking pretty good
[1:25:07] SpidercowSD: Love that Prot Warriors Get Die by the Sword.... wtf lol
[1:25:14] Kriven: no shit?
[1:25:27] Murlock07: oh shit
[1:25:41] Mecabeast: fury tree needs some tweaks otherwise I'm fine with the warrior trees as is
[1:25:48] Fawcheddar: does the bar snap
[1:25:51] DiiscoViking: add a feedback note to ask for snap
[1:25:56] chillmodez: is it just me , or are prot warriors still weak to magic, doesnt look like any magic mitigation on that tree
[1:26:11] Zeke_nl: war going to be immortal
[1:26:19] papayapayama: @chillmodez bro look closer. they have spell block
[1:26:19] Rexialiton: I love when Towelliee says lol LUL
[1:26:26] Mecabeast: spell reflect is still 10% magic reduction right?
[1:26:30] SpidercowSD: Prot can spec into Spell Block

[1:27:05] Tendag: whats spell block
[1:27:14] kt_mina: yes

[1:29:01] yurenne4: Is there a way to play the game from the begining of its story? I mean I want to learn lore with playing the game not jumping the latest expansion ?
[1:29:31] ZyntosAran: @mugen1989 wow classic
[1:29:32] SeckSymbols: Prot warrior going to be nasty
[1:29:35] Radizan: @mugen1989 go play classic it'll be good
[1:29:35] PvtHudson093: this tree looks miles better than paladin
[1:29:57] Mecabeast: @mugen1989 on a 2nd character you can first toon has to go through exiles reach also most classic quests got replaced on azeroth during cata
[1:30:15] belaham: They should make it do say bleeds so it includes Rend also
[1:31:03] MrSparxx: other tree
[1:31:05] Fawcheddar: rip
[1:31:06] Siven80: you got that in class tree
[1:31:09] literally_human_garbage: class tree
[1:31:10] MrSparxx: warrior tree
[1:31:51] Stariot: hey Towelliee how are you this morning
[1:31:51] Coriollis: wait what if u spec in stance dancing aka all 3 ?
[1:32:39] Imperius_Aeon: rating for warrior out of 10?
[1:32:54] Akuka_: the imp throw and the cleave bleed was mentioned as not working together like they should in the post they made I thought?
[1:33:01] Daarksyde: thats OP!!
[1:33:14] Allsee_: Tooltip is wrong, its 75%
[1:33:34] gregl__: 30% ur takin it
[1:33:46] SLoPPYALieN: until cancelled... or probably brought over the 35% life it goes away
[1:34:01] SpidercowSD: Charge looks like for pvp
[1:34:14] Stariot: hey towelliee any tips for someone coming back to wow right now
[1:34:31] Siven80: shield charge seems dissapointing to me, 45sec cd, not melee range

[1:34:49] RoboMaximillion: yes
[1:34:51] RoboMaximillion: you do
[1:34:52] Akuka_: known issue
[1:34:52] mejiro151: one should replace
[1:34:52] Malarick: Jeebus. which dev respecced to warrior?
[1:34:55] SLoPPYALieN: nice!
[1:34:57] Sollice: Hmm wonder what the maintenance is on Retail
[1:34:58] Coriollis: alpha spaghetti code LUL
[1:34:59] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee did you get upgrade currency from doing heroic and mythic fated raid?
[1:35:00] Hellifyoudont66: That is definitely broken. stripLUL
[1:35:00] Akuka_: Some talent overrides are not working correctly, and you are able to use both spells (E.G. Annihilator doesn‚Äôt replace Raging Blow).
[1:35:09] SLoPPYALieN: That could be rad
[1:35:17] Mecabeast: how bout bersker rage and berserker shout seems they might be seperate
[1:35:31] Sollice: 14 seconds jesus
[1:35:40] mejiro151: its just like the 100% uptime paladin talent
[1:35:52] mejiro151: you block it based on your block rating
[1:35:58] MaleFrom73: they will spellsteal it?
[1:35:59] Coriollis: proly works like spell reflect, like the moment of the cast
[1:36:00] kevdeckie: there's no cheating the system... either one you use puts the other on CD.  They just need to make the improved version replace the old version on your bar
[1:36:06] MrSparxx: I guess it still depends on your block chance
[1:36:17] mejiro151: you dont block ALL spells
[1:36:25] mejiro151: just mitigate some of it
[1:36:25] paragon_3: I think you can get all three of the last talents on the right side
[1:36:40] Tarrasso: For what i understand it is like Holy Shield
[1:36:45] Coriollis: because I don't see Blizz giving u an aoe spell silence area arround u

[1:37:39] cptrogers123: outburst
[1:37:41] SLoPPYALieN: free IP is great alone
[1:37:44] JQ47: try outburst
[1:37:49] SLoPPYALieN: but the extra 200% on other stuff is noice!
[1:37:50] Knocx: awww yea, morning towel
[1:37:52] icerasta: I dont think that is supposed to be a ability though. that would be weird to press
[1:38:04] Stariot: hey towelliee any tips for someone coming back to wow right now
[1:38:12] ArrowsWolf: hello Towelliee ! I have a question, did they already nerf Dracthyr‚Äôs Soar?
[1:38:55] MrSparxx: Shield Charge looks amazing, imho. Great opener.
[1:39:02] captiv8: With the aoe bleed you probably won‚Äôt need ravaged.
[1:39:23] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee did you get upgrade currecny when you did heroic and mythic raid?
[1:39:25] FleuryGG: Echo doing Fated CN heroic, every time a boss dies all their games freeze for like 6 seconds KEKW
[1:40:05] SLoPPYALieN: They also have some issue where people being moved in groups or adding/removing players causing the 6 seconds lag too
[1:40:08] SahdTimes: Prot pvp is going to be fun with this tree
[1:40:10] Mecabeast: I was having some freeze issues last night even on normal when a boss died
[1:40:14] liama_in_a_taco: oh live if u get certain fated items they wont let iu use catalyst atm
[1:40:43] Rob3phones: spellblock?
[1:40:44] Squats3: @Towelliee Having both devastate and devastator (2 rows down, at that) is odd. You will NEVER actually want to get devastate and actually press it.
[1:40:44] Shmikal: devastate right

[1:42:14] PrimalRain: yeah little laggy
[1:42:19] AlphasaurusRexx: your heroic throw did not apply deep wounds
[1:42:22] MrSparxx: TC also refreshes rend
[1:42:24] nimshot: its your auto-attacks that are seemingly applying DW not HT
[1:42:39] SLoPPYALieN: Titanic didnt apply deepwounds
[1:43:01] Siven80: yeah, looked like deep wounds on throw doesnt work with aoe throw
[1:43:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  its not the heroic throw that gives Deep Wounds atm
[1:43:20] Rottencoarse: your auto attacks does give deep wounds
[1:43:25] Siven80: although seemed like it did there
[1:43:41] Fawcheddar: report titanic throw
[1:43:41] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[1:43:49] Imperius_Aeon: thats legion/bfa prot no?
[1:43:55] Imperius_Aeon: blood and thunder or something back then
[1:43:56] Rottencoarse: yeah it seems that heroic throw does not give deep wounds
[1:43:56] Mecabeast: prot looks exciting to play might pick tanking up again in df
[1:44:03] Imperius_Aeon: thunderclap applies rend
[1:44:07] CYNIC308: classic warriors hate him! LUL
[1:44:09] SLoPPYALieN: try heroic throw only
[1:44:11] SLoPPYALieN: just to see
[1:44:20] captiv8: Titanic throw doesn‚Äôt work when you are right next to your target. You have to be 5ish yards away.
[1:44:24] abracka_: how's prot warrior feeling? hard to compare to prot paladin since most of their talents were (or are) bugged to hell
[1:44:27] Fawcheddar: your autos ar
[1:44:28] Fawcheddar: are
[1:44:31] Grankish: your melee is applying deep wounds
[1:44:35] PrimalRain: your auto attack is doing it
[1:44:39] MaddyLif3: that was your auto applying it
[1:44:47] Akuka_: It's listed in the blue post for warrior it doesn't work
[1:44:52] Rottencoarse: yeah it was your auto applying it
[1:44:54] Darzetti_: ya only did to main target
[1:44:59] SahdTimes: Does tc apply a fresh rend when it spreads, or the same duration as what it spread from?
[1:45:01] SLoPPYALieN: yeah actual heroic throw will
[1:45:01] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  check the warrior blue post
[1:45:02] Woundar: devastator does it i think so autos in this case
[1:45:04] Rottencoarse: it's not working
[1:45:13] Imperius_Aeon: no
[1:45:28] Fawcheddar: yeah the 4 others arent I dont think
[1:45:57] donin: is it a separate skill or does it apply to heroic throw
[1:45:58] MrSparxx: it's still good
[1:45:59] Mitune: Madge why no 2h + shield Warrior Kappa
[1:46:04] dimofodi: Could go down Intimidating Shout instead
[1:46:15] Rottencoarse: yeah it's better than stormbolt for the prot @Towelliee
[1:46:28] abracka_: "Some talent dependencies and combinations are not working correctly. (E.G. Combining Titanic Throw and Improved Heroic Throw doesn‚Äôt apply Deep Wounds to all affected targets)"
[1:46:47] Rottencoarse: @abracka_  yup that one
[1:47:26] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  check what abracka wrote
[1:47:34] deathcrier: is there a new dungeon this week?

[1:48:43] lunchbox8669: Beta Inc?
[1:48:47] Polarisss_: hows prot feeling?
[1:48:53] Mitune: maybe not enough time for them to send out if it still has to be manual
[1:49:11] smoothmelodies: Are those all the dungeons in the game?
[1:49:49] Radizan: Prot looks like its got the survivability of WOTLK Paladin
[1:50:28] djdavecee: Started gearing up some alts i just levelled, just done a few hc dungeons, tooptip in guide says 249 gear, but it's dropping 242, anyone know why?
[1:50:58] MrSparxx: You only hit it once though :D
[1:51:16] Squats3: @Towelliee prot looks like its going to by very very tanky.
[1:51:29] Mitune: I think so
[1:51:34] captain69: @Towelliee hello i know many asked but hows prot war look like so far?
[1:51:34] MrSparxx: has to be at one target first
[1:51:40] Tirony: no thats just revenge
[1:51:41] MrSparxx: it spreads it
[1:51:49] Tarrasso: No Ravage is your Aoe applicator
[1:51:51] Mecabeast: @djdavecee probably tooltip error m0 drops 262 so 242 heroic makes sense
[1:51:56] papayapayama: thunderclap is a general talent its not tied to prot?
[1:51:56] SahdTimes: Mmmm those thicc non outburst shield slams
[1:52:02] EKS90_: Looks like it spreads rend, but doesnt show up?
[1:52:08] EKS90_: now it did
[1:52:22] j_bar111: Prot warrior doing more bleed damage then feral druid KEKW
[1:52:26] djdavecee: @Mecabeast ahh, ok, makes sense, cheers for reply
[1:52:34] Mitune: @j_bar111 TRUE
[1:52:37] Cakeabsorber: hmmm
[1:52:49] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-dragonflight-warrior-feedback-bluepost-328140 check this
[1:52:52] captiv8: You should go to the target dummy that hits you and test out the broken damage reduction talent.
[1:52:55] Rottencoarse: i just did
[1:52:56] athrapy_: Isn't deep wounds dependent on crits?
[1:52:59] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-dragonflight-warrior-feedback-bluepost-328140
[1:53:17] barnanimal: prot warrior tree seems great
[1:53:48] literally_human_garbage: maybe that's one of the dependencies/combos that doesn't work
[1:54:14] Otton_03: Below TClap
[1:54:17] Taaliaaaa: its the talent under it I think?
[1:54:32] Rottencoarse: it's the talent under Thunder Clap @Towelliee

[1:54:57] athrapy_: Does T-Clap apply deep wounds if it crits on other targets or is crit not a factor anymore?
[1:55:04] sxarthur: yep looks like it
[1:55:08] MrSparxx: I havent seen a Talent, that spreads Deep Wounds
[1:55:09] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah in the paranthesis it says that it's not working
[1:55:23] Julman33: thunderclaps only spread rend no?
[1:55:26] SeckSymbols: I dont think its supposed to
[1:55:26] Rottencoarse: for the titanic throw
[1:55:28] SeckSymbols: Its onyl rend
[1:55:32] Tirony: can revenge proc deep wounds as it is in live servers?
[1:55:49] nimshot: Can you check the DW passive in your spellbook, maybe it has some info on it there?
[1:55:59] EvoThis: the wounds are deep
[1:56:03] MrSparxx: Isn't deep wounds your mastery or somethn?
[1:56:04] Mitune: Thunderclap used to apply deep wounds with a crit, but that is old so it might be confusing people
[1:56:04] Rottencoarse: yeah it seems to be buggy @Towelliee
[1:56:21] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also deep wounds is the prot warrior mastery
[1:56:21] Tarrasso: Your autos apply deep wound because you have the passive devestate talent
[1:56:33] PadidinJones: Hey @Towelliee hows it going?
[1:56:41] Tirony: ok so as it should be
[1:56:47] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it's the devastate talent
[1:56:50] Rottencoarse: also
[1:57:27] literally_human_garbage: yeah revenge works
[1:57:30] Tirony: seems like lessen range of claeve on Revenge
[1:58:09] Garakk: stormbolt would be really helpful for m+
[1:58:25] dimofodi: You could go Intimidating Shout instead of Stormbolt/Titanic throw to get where you're going currently.
[1:58:37] Grey_masterr: How many stacks do you need to activate Outburst?
[1:58:59] Mecabeast: could you try the dummies at kyrian sanctum I think they have some good clumped ones.

[2:07:56] TweakerTheGreat: @commander_eggi they do look enticing to play, I've never mained a warrior, but their trees look badass. The class fantasy of warrior was always so appealing to me

[2:22:39] CowboyxJack: @towelliee in your opinion, why doesn‚Äôt Blizzard just make cities one layer so that retail feels really active? Loved how good new worlds settlements felt with hundreds and hundreds of players running around.
[2:22:49] MrSparxx: @Eviltuna13 nope
[2:22:59] biirrd: "It is currently unknown if Lithragosa is the only Dragonriding trainer that lets you deal with talents, but it is to be expected you will find other Dragonriding trainers in other Dragon Isles zones."

[2:47:11] Velot_: I'd love to be able to join a guild without spending money
[2:47:27] Kisswani: @Velot_r I would imagine realms is more technical than anything
[2:47:31] hogrekilz: do you know what the addon is called that shows talents trinks and legos you have equip and using

[2:50:45] Holysal: @TheUnknowing ppl just check the spec they play and log off. this is the issue for how they are doing targeted testing.
[2:50:47] Bugszy: i love that flying
[2:50:49] nevrowz: DF looks really good!

[3:00:09] nerdlogik: what kind of addons do you use, towel?
[3:00:16] lucid_wow: @the_pyke it also looks pretty bad how far into the tree skull banner is, i guess its behind stuff u want most of the time anyway but still seems a little weird forcing you into a specific path
[3:00:37] pcwarri0r: I think only lower kara is way out there everything else is fine
[3:00:43] Woodland_Critter: No, ilevels. I saw footage earlier with crazy high ilevel scaling. Everything just instadied with 50k+ DPS.

[3:02:57] Kinghorn: gutted not butted
[3:02:58] Milanesa_De_Pollo: are you queueing for normal or heroic?
[3:03:21] BearOfLight: well is sounds like Tazavesh amd docks are fine and apparently (i havent run it yet but,) Mechagon feels undertuned

[3:49:47] ashnmsr: Hey Towelliee how's warrior tank feeling?
[3:49:55] wertywaz: @Towelliee The current Seismic legendary is Whirlwind only so it might just be broken for Revenge since that's a new addition

[3:51:38] theDirtyon3: HOLY SHIT LUL
[3:51:45] lucid_wow: i think its counting the 2nd hit of revenge from the talent as a revenge cast so its chaining off itself infinitely

[6:40:57] mavericks312: oh thats gonna happen 100%
[6:40:59] blinca: "flip materials" good luck flipping any materials with auction house changes
[6:40:59] scumlucki: Gonna start a union
[6:41:09] Sollice: @Sollice Oh I dont.I actually thought it was quite clever of me to say that
[6:41:10] SLoPPYALieN: that's good... that would suck balls if it was all things
[6:41:17] mavericks312: supply and demand
[6:41:18] gholdan: is 9.2.7 going to be prepatch?
[6:41:26] Parduke: i wonder if there will be profession talent resets and how much they cost
[6:41:28] RoboMaximillion: yeah the gold sink to level up leggo ranks was ass
[6:41:36] Jack_the_Dipper: Anyone on low/medium pops will see prices drop
[6:41:37] 24sevn: Why did blizzard cancel the mobile wow mmo?
[6:41:38] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @gholdan prepatch will be 10.0
[6:41:40] luckfore: 9.2.7 is what 8.3.7 was for BFA, preparations for the next expac
[6:42:04] gholdan: @gholdan oh okay thought 10.0 was dragonflight
[6:42:11] Jack_the_Dipper: @24sevn you mean the AH app?
[6:42:15] mavericks312: @luckfore its like pre-prepatch
[6:42:23] Coriollis: I haven't had a gathering prof on my raid char since wotlk
[6:42:28] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @Towelliee have you been asking Blizzard to make gather professions into secondary profession? What did they say? And what about having more professions slots like in Rift?
[6:42:29] chillmodez: are the profession talent tree things extend to the gathering professions to?
[6:42:31] udrogue: I like FFXIV's profession system, can do anything
[6:42:32] WaTaFelix: They should do the FF14 route and let us have all professions
[6:42:43] CrimsonNurse: I feel like you should be allowed to have as many profession as you want on each character
[6:42:47] Katrikan: giving 3 proffs to characters you know bots will go crazy
[6:42:58] mavericks312: @WaTaFelix that would kill the economy, maybe just give us all the gathering profs
[6:43:03] Snabido: Half measure would be everyone has mining/skin/herb, but as primary prof you gain more
[6:43:24] Jack_the_Dipper: @WaTaFelix Don't think you want that, everything will become very low in value because of the supply

[6:43:29] Milanesa_De_Pollo: That's what was cool about New World tbh, being able to gather what you wanted.
[6:43:30] PrimalRain: they can't stop bots regardless
[6:43:30] Nyte0013: bots already go crazy, it doesn't matter
[6:43:32] KradishUK: Giving all the gathering profs to people wouldn't really do anything to bots - the sheer quantity of bot accounts means it wouldnt make a real difference
[6:43:51] WaTaFelix: @Jack_the_Dipper I don't mind that.
[6:43:58] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee economy got fucked in WoD when every1 had access to ore and herbs from the garrison, i dont think many ppl want a repeat of that
[6:44:00] MrSparxx: Can you respec your crafting specs/talents?
[6:44:00] Coriollis: they could easily implement something like u can't see a node or a flower or skin something if u gathered x ammount of valuable for Y ammount of minitues
[6:44:13] Sollice: Did i actually kill tom
[6:44:17] Sollice: He stopped talking

[6:45:33] Sollice: no. I crash in BF too much and its annoying the shit out of me
[6:45:44] Sollice: I get constant DX issues
[6:45:51] 91Niki: @Sollice it's okay. it was deserved. He came in here claiming we all play alliance. Fucking rude
[6:46:04] KradishUK: Limits like that would have ruined the 10 hours of gold earning I did in SL  :(
[6:46:05] Coriollis: yea like u gathered the x valuable from a mine and now u got a timer or diminishing returns till u can get it again
[6:46:07] Katrikan: implement ''energy'' like those asian mmos and let ppl go insane
[6:46:13] Sollice: Oh...I mean I am playing alliance LOL
[6:46:16] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Do you think if people keep requesting for gather profession to be secondary professions in the Alpha/Beta, Blizzard might do it?

[6:46:31] WaTaFelix: @mavericks312 That would still be better.
[6:46:34] Jack_the_Dipper: So bots and multiboxers have benefits (sadly) they keep the material prices low on a lot of servers but it cause also the problem that the non multi and bot farmers can get value
[6:46:50] Jack_the_Dipper: can't
[6:46:51] BearOfLight: sorry. just got back, what are you wnating changed?
[6:46:56] WARRIORPOWER: Warrior talents are looking solid!
[6:46:57] Bigvont: @Towelliee You can still put a comission on AH even for BoP gear. The buyer will get the item which will be bound to the buyer I think.
[6:46:59] Milanesa_De_Pollo: True LUL
[6:47:01] c3llout7: yeah dude it was so troll like woohoo

[6:47:39] KradishUK: Is the work order system in the alpha yet?
[6:47:42] 91Niki: @Sollice I see those too often in real life. It's more than enough for me
[6:47:56] WaTaFelix: You did procc it.
[6:48:23] Sollice: I dunno Niki. She doesnt even really play and I had to switch my faction :/
[6:48:28] Parduke: missives force secondary stats
[6:48:35] biirrd: @Towelliee Its no longer random 2 stats, you can pick what stats you like to have
[6:49:09] 91Niki: @Sollice Gattz is hacking in BF2042. Killing people without knowing where they are sacSUS
[6:49:21] MrGattz: well dont tell people!
[6:49:42] Sollice: @91Niki Thats called old BF when you could snipe and they wouldnt give away your position on a death camera
[6:49:50] Sollice: When the world of BF was right
[6:50:22] biirrd: @Towelliee on the massives, when you select on the craft
[6:50:47] 91Niki: @91Niki He just flick shot someone who was behind him shooting at him, and just happened to hit him and killed him LUL
[6:50:56] 91Niki: with a sniper
[6:51:13] Sollice: @91Niki @MrGattz I get so triggered when I am playing with the crossbow doing really well. I mean I have lots of fun shotting people through vehicle windows and killing them Then the game crashed and I want to murder my dogs
[6:51:28] Parduke: i thought it was dragon alloy you needed?
[6:51:29] Snabido: XP buff song Keepo

[6:52:28] Rodorann: OH? Pog
[6:52:28] jarvii_: PogChamp
[6:52:37] llNoTToXiCll: stats that matter on crafted gear
[6:52:41] Sollice: I need to get the explosive ammo
[6:52:42] KradishUK: Imagine dying and losing food buff  :'D
[6:52:55] WaTaFelix: Probably from other professions
[6:53:13] CrimsonNurse: Aren't they normally off vendors in a area where you need rep with a faction?
[6:53:30] berserker_strike: i think theyre from inscriptions
[6:53:32] KradishUK: what do the lower ranks of the food buff thing do?
[6:53:36] jarvii_: could be what makes engineering profitable
[6:53:43] atrexy_: you can't
[6:54:50] atrexy_: maybe because if you add a embelishment the difficult increases and then you'll need the infusions ?
[6:54:51] biirrd: you need to add the infuse
[6:55:02] Parduke: what are the pauldrons above those?
[6:55:06] llNoTToXiCll: can you get the stuff you need from vendors?
[6:55:26] Artiiz: are prot not good? Or are they just too buggy

[6:56:10] jtrue10: is this for wotlk?
[6:56:12] Axel_N: Hows everything so far, ive been outta the loop
[6:56:54] KradishUK: Maybe they realised that prot warr needed more damage and this is their fix?  :>
[6:57:01] Dankind64: Seems like it's working to me
[6:57:03] Artiiz: Clearly intended, they saw how terrible prot war were during SL and buffed them
[6:57:08] Cilir: Morn'n towelliee and chat
[6:57:11] Amazanmartyn: Amazanmartyn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[6:57:20] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I really dislike how Blizzard didn't add a new Crafter's mark for crafted gear this season, it makes it hard to have a starter armor for alts/new players
[6:57:34] gritbarontv: but it's killing fast, shouldn't be a problem, lol
[6:57:55] Eejvert: cant u shift click ?

[6:58:28] REDSKULL_tv: lmao
[6:58:29] WaTaFelix: Clearly intended.
[6:58:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: they just have a lot of anger built up over the years so it makes revenge hit harder
[6:58:35] KradishUK: If you leave it too late to report their last minute desperate fix will ruin the spec the entire expac
[6:58:36] Dankind64: if tanks were that strong there would be too few DPS in queue
[6:58:45] Aidler: is there still a chance for prot paladins to not be bad in DF?
[6:58:47] Slitze: Towelliee was the kid in class who reminded the teacher we need to turn in our homework
[6:58:55] TombStoneMercenary: With what you have seen so far are you confident in a 22 launch or do you see them pushing till 23?
[6:59:10] Slitze: LUL
[6:59:12] chill_xf: need alot changes for prot to be relevant
[6:59:18] chill_xf: prot paly
[6:59:24] Rodorann: yall doing homework?
[6:59:26] Sollice: He was the type of kid who looked at the teacher and said if you give me homework I will murder you
[6:59:29] falldrgn: Towliee was the one in the front of the class.. pencils organized by color and length
[6:59:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: i had a teacher that let other kids make the notation that we did our homework, we would just show them a blank page half the time and get credit
[6:59:43] CMack_72: @Aidler There is always a chance.  There is also a chance that I might get bit by a shark at a McDonald's drive-thru too.

[7:01:37] Kratosjr1: This is what they have told there shareholders
[7:01:42] TombStoneMercenary: Prepatch could be considered a soft launch so they could pass it off as dec launch?
[7:01:45] falldrgn: I just hope they say something in the next month or so.
[7:01:48] Teldrin89: no way xd

[7:04:27] llNoTToXiCll: not too much milk just like a Big sip
[7:04:45] CrimsonNurse: Proton pump inhibitors work well

[7:19:47] Hawkzerr: Makes sense.
[7:19:50] tornbraclet: and if you are fury spec RIP
[7:19:55] NightsoleTV: Rip fury titans grip users

[7:20:01] Moobot: Yoitsnova, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[7:20:07] FrankTheTank1988: its limited because this crafting gear can compete with mythic raid gear.
[7:20:11] Gapplebees1: Single Minded Fury incoming
[7:20:11] llNoTToXiCll: Was crafting always limited  in old expansions like wrath
[7:20:14] nolank85: Or two-two handlers and one piece of armor
[7:20:18] FrankTheTank1988: at endgame
[7:20:20] llNoTToXiCll: i simply dont remember honestly
[7:20:23] Utmost777: @FrankTheTank1988 and?
[7:20:32] LightBladeStream: It only harms 1 spec in the entire game, fury
[7:20:44] ashnmsr: Deessss
[7:20:48] themightyc: !alpha
[7:20:48] Moobot: @themightyc ALPHA PHASE 4 - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. Beta in a month?
[7:20:56] itscityboy: @Towelliee when's the next sock on head stream?
[7:21:00] FrankTheTank1988: @UtmostOwnage its to prevent any one person/guild from just going crafting balistic and skip raid gearing all together.
[7:21:10] FrankTheTank1988: blizz dont want you to make all your gear LUL
[7:21:48] itscityboy: This new expansion should be fun.
[7:22:39] Utmost777: @FrankTheTank1988 so balance the matt requirement to compensate. If it is easier to just kill bosses than to farm mats they will kill bosses. there are ways to do it, but not letting people play how they want because some degens will play badly is dumb imo
[7:23:14] Articeptious: seismic in sl is hella fun as prot
[7:23:22] Coriollis: also warrior healing seems through the roof
[7:23:29] chubahi: just tuned in..u got this alot i guess but how did warr feel in this build in alpha :) ?
[7:23:31] Sollice: Do a marathon
[7:23:35] itscityboy: Either way I'll be there to support with gifted subs
[7:23:36] Sollice: Those are easier to manage lol
[7:23:40] PrimalRain: he knows Kappa
[7:23:47] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee what is the suspected release date for DF you think?
[7:23:49] Articeptious: indomitable with the self heal and stoneform cd
[7:23:56] llNoTToXiCll: whats about a marasubathon
[7:24:01] mashiesmashie: I always feel so sorry for you sleeping on the floor lol
[7:24:22] Articeptious: we back in d3 or what
[7:24:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: towelclause has no time for a subathon
[7:24:27] FrankTheTank1988: @UtmostOwnage you do realise that the new crafting system will let you make Raid level gear right? this has never happend before, all crafting gear in past has fallen off from dungeon gear and very few pieces of gear has stuck even during raid gear. (Example some of the blacksmith weapons in TBC specilizations)
[7:24:30] TheCliffyShow: @mashiesmashie I think he has an actual bed for the events now.
[7:24:35] jetributions: but does as interupt
[7:25:04] llNoTToXiCll: @FrankTheTank1988  that is actually really wicked
[7:25:09] mashiesmashie: ohh, hadn't noticed the bed, maybe the stream only showed him asleep when I looked
[7:25:13] MrGattz: @Sollice send it again
[7:25:15] TheCliffyShow: That lady in the pictuare looks pissed.
[7:25:16] Utmost777: @FrankTheTank1988 yes, i do realize this. they are trying to copy New World crafting but they stop short so it is just meh
[7:25:38] FrankTheTank1988: yeah it sucks a bit, but at least they are trying to make it better :D
[7:25:51] llNoTToXiCll: being told what i was just told the crafting system is actually really cool
[7:26:56] Keyastaron_: decrerease
[7:27:19] Utmost777: @FrankTheTank1988 that we can agree on :)
[7:27:21] FrankTheTank1988: as for the 2h weapon counting as two equipped crafted, that has to change or its kinda not fair to the classes who use a two hander. D:  not sure what blizz is thinking on that front.
[7:27:33] Ooshraxa: 2745 47.09

[7:31:26] f1sh1nad1sh: things like armor are multiplication in the sense that if you go from 80% DR to 81% DR, that technically means you're taking 5% less damage
