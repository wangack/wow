[1:32:04] driftwood_tc: I hate playing my feral I love the playstyle but always being the kill target is exhausting.
[1:32:06] nikthevoker: this is kinda like outlaw/dev but more dam
[1:32:28] nikthevoker: this is ferals best comp atm
[1:32:41] nikthevoker: ive been tolld by many ferals asking to play LUL
[1:33:21] shoal3: this feral is used to playing while being focused you can tell
[1:33:48] nikthevoker: ya augs shit now, and dev is tankier
[1:33:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Last season the aug buffed the feral, and the feral bled everything to death
[1:34:00] Reizzy42: i was gonan was the dam from devo is insane
[1:34:05] nikthevoker: so its more dam version
[1:34:12] goatskull123: the purpose of the feral is to draw the fire away from the devoker lol
[1:34:17] nikthevoker: ya
[1:34:22] nikthevoker: hes used 2
[1:34:32] afriKENx: how do they still not track kidney shot
[1:34:38] Reizzy42: do devo evokers just not die anymore?
[1:34:52] nikthevoker: feral is the distraction
[1:34:54] maybethistimepls: dont see cassidy much but when i do its in tourny lvl
[1:34:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah going into bear means the feral is doing next to no damage

[1:37:04] Absagert: feral is the red headed step child in pvp and pve
[1:37:23] the_kchain: Nethy doing work
[1:37:29] Xeliumimar: Thank god they buffed feral regrowth
[1:37:32] nikthevoker: i dont get why nethy isnt playing timestop
[1:37:40] kreyzy8: I try not to complain but man this matchup is boring KEKW
[1:37:42] nikthevoker: or are they not tracking
[1:37:52] nikthevoker: 4th DR he should die
[1:37:54] shoal3: i saw plate users got their armor nerfed, is that why no wars or rets and barely any dks?
[1:37:57] nikthevoker: something should die
[1:38:17] Mortifiedwow: Feral is dog water
[1:38:31] goatskull123: not gona lie, this is pretty boring
[1:39:09] Xeliumimar: if they dont kill before incarn its gg
[1:39:39] nikthevoker: its looking like nethy is just using it it when cassidy is running
[1:39:41] kreyzy8: feral trying to attack an arcane mage, outlaw, or rdruid LUL

[1:42:44] flameohotmann: that was depressing to watch
[1:42:49] mihoXt: exactly
[1:42:52] Reizzy42: if any other melee or caster is with the devo do they just win?
[1:42:59] dankgamer97: idk if going resto is a better target then mage ?
[1:43:06] flameohotmann: i mean for the feral
[1:43:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I can tell Cassidy is one of the best ferals in the game, it's just the spec takes so much damage and bear is not a great answer
[1:43:15] dankgamer97: kinda hard for feral to get to mage
[1:43:31] nikthevoker: whenever he popped DR they were never on any same target with aa cc on healer juust feel bad
[1:43:41] cookietime95: JFF PAYS
[1:43:45] nikthevoker: he was so close
[1:44:04] Reizzy42: i mean cassidy played awesome that game and lived for ever but like is any other melee or caster ?

[1:47:09] diosilvl: no, cassidy still in, rdru out
[1:47:11] Saitistreamy: holy god the ratio is so bad for ultima now
[1:47:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: BM can bring pressure
[1:47:16] nikthevoker: cassidy feral jungle
[1:47:20] nikthevoker: nethy healing
[1:47:39] Saitistreamy: they are nuts
[1:47:40] Saitistreamy: lol
[1:47:44] Saitistreamy: the ratio was insane at the start
[1:47:47] cookietime95: couldnt be me
[1:47:50] Saitistreamy: like it was 333 odds to 1
[1:47:55] Saitistreamy: so they dumped points in not realize
[1:48:27] Reizzy42: bm dev would be spicy
[1:48:40] afriKENx: bm dev does sound lke it would fuck a mage
[1:48:48] afriKENx: and tranq darts
[1:48:54] Cyndren99: bing bong, bingbingbong bing bong
[1:48:55] itstherealloki: all good man :)
[1:49:04] Reizzy42: does details show pet damage yet?
[1:49:12] nikthevoker: is the druid hot WA n waigo anyone know the name
[1:49:33] mihoXt: @Reizzy42 yes but i think its not included in the shown bar
[1:50:00] seraph_wow: stream a lil quiet on ur side mes
[1:50:30] Xeliumimar: I will take these channel points when 'Just for fun' wins
[1:50:37] diosilvl: is bm dps is also bugged on here?
[1:50:39] VenoFrog: i think it's fine
[1:50:41] flameohotmann: broadcast volume a. bit low
[1:50:42] Xeliumimar: no volume is good mes dont turn it up more pls
[1:50:45] Reizzy42: i wondewr how annoying tranq darts plus evoker purge for the R druid is
[1:50:47] seraph_wow: just that the stream a lil quiet compared to voice
[1:51:09] DouzySham: @seraph_wow i vote for this also
[1:51:12] seraph_wow: yah thats poifect thanks :)
[1:51:57] diosilvl: surely that bm dps cant be correct?
[1:52:14] whspe: Rip that person's points
[1:52:14] afriKENx: @diosilvl doesnt show pet dmg
[1:52:24] Xeliumimar: yeaaah gimmie those chanel points BBY
[1:52:28] runnnnnit: who plays feral
[1:52:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Nethy was playing really good on pres evoker, just too hard to keep a cat alive
[1:52:39] afriKENx: +150k points
[1:52:46] runnnnnit: for a 100k
[1:52:50] dankgamer97: a bit lower maybe
[1:52:51] mayfire15: I feel they only win that if they oom rdruid and it wasn’t even close
[1:52:52] Reizzy42: i wanna see devo BM into rmp
[1:53:23] melodyolivair: Maybe they should put a rogue on their team
[1:53:25] nikthevoker: if they charge druid or go rogue just dont try to fight mage in open
[1:53:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Replace the cat with an outlaw rogue and they might have won, true
[1:53:45] kreyzy8: its so hard for cassidy to go for clones, he either gets kicked our kidney'd out of form
[1:53:46] runnnnnit: bear form half the game unfortunatly
[1:53:55] kreyzy8: seems so risky
[1:54:03] kreyzy8: oh yeah I know but its like a lose/lose
[1:54:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the ferals are forced to use clone
[1:54:41] obviouslytai: not to mention the wrath damage is very good in tree
[1:55:10] mihoXt: yeah its bad
[1:55:25] kreyzy8: LUL
[1:55:29] RottenBanana209: @notmes do you think we gonna see bdk in awc?
[1:55:34] mihoXt: make it a procc to get instant cyclone + dmg
[1:56:52] nikthevoker: mes do you know the name of the enemy druid hot on target WA
[1:56:56] michaelss_: instant clone would be obnoxious, you’re talking about a better blind consistently haha
[1:56:57] runnnnnit: not be feral
[1:57:22] dankgamer97: True
[1:57:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ideally they would always be in cat form, yeah
[1:57:31] Reizzy42: that would smooth out alot of feral abilities
[1:57:47] dankgamer97: Bring back insta clone FeelsBadMan
[1:58:03] dankgamer97: trenXD
[1:58:04] applescruffs23: what about making their finisher proc allow clone cast in form, not instant but cast in form?
[1:58:12] runnnnnit: yeah no
[1:58:15] Reizzy42: casting regrowth and clone in feral would smoth out alot of feral i think and make it not so clunky
[1:58:18] obviouslytai: having any damage attached to cc feels so bad tho
[1:59:06] dankgamer97: They should have tryed dev bm
[1:59:14] Reizzy42: or give feral insta clone but put it on a 20 second CD
[1:59:20] kreyzy8: cassidy can't play the game Sadge
[1:59:23] zubuxbl: why dont they hit rogue?
[1:59:38] obviouslytai: is outlaw really tanky?
[1:59:38] Boom0101: how did you guys do in awc
[2:00:10] Boom0101: whoops gl tomorrow
[2:00:12] Boom0101: :)
[2:00:17] kreyzy8: they also get passive +4% verse lol
[2:00:24] kreyzy8: and more melee range
[2:00:32] ConchubarOD: what does the water torrent in this map do?
[2:00:35] runnnnnit: @obviouslytai any high level rogue in this meta is basically unkillable
[2:00:37] kreyzy8: not the verse
[2:00:41] kreyzy8: that's outlaw only now
[2:00:48] afriKENx: @ConchubarOD los
[2:00:53] afriKENx: when its all the way down
[2:01:13] ConchubarOD: it doesn't damage you tho, it just becomes a wall?
[2:01:22] afriKENx: yeah
[2:01:30] ConchubarOD: thanks :)
[2:01:34] ConchubarOD: not a pvper haha

[2:02:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Arcane guy played it well
[2:02:33] eMBeaR64oz: Wonder if they could give feral their regrowths a bit more hp and off gcd or something, and maybe some other tankiness buff
[2:02:47] michaelss_: he doesn’t attack again

[2:06:02] Calmseeker89: I don't think he cares about money either
[2:06:13] afriKENx: lontar might be the most versatile healer
[2:06:19] Boruox: Hey Mes did you noticed Sokweeen's overall healing?
[2:06:29] NightMunchies: everyone does i think
[2:06:41] BCboy_: he was also winning private server tournaments before that as well

[2:08:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm betting on the Furbolgs because why not LUL
[2:08:12] runnnnnit: echo vs liquid would be the best final
[2:08:31] runnnnnit: i dream of it
[2:08:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo dropped a round with Raiku on arcane
[2:08:48] Calmseeker89: maybe DH ele?

[2:09:21] obviouslytai: competing is stressful. even if your just playing a video game. not everyone can play at the highest level so its a lot of continuous grinding
[2:09:46] NightMunchies: yeah ^^
[2:10:15] Reizzy42: is rogue ele good?

[3:05:25] NightMunchies: wish
[3:05:37] McLarge: I don't expect they get Dex like that again
[3:05:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: GO GO GO
[3:05:52] Solushun: not a huge fan of rdruid with double melee :O
[3:06:04] NightMunchies: will see who wins
[3:06:36] McLarge: Karijes damage btw
[3:06:37] mihoXt: warr dps crazy but ppl call for dh bans hahaha
[3:06:40] Saitistreamy: hero cleave is good into casters, and looks like good into melee cleave?
[3:06:45] NightMunchies: sh!
[3:06:49] Saitistreamy: DH meta confirmed lol
[3:07:00] Saitistreamy: rogue and dh
[3:07:09] nikthevoker: tree
[3:07:19] NightMunchies: go after dh
[3:07:19] runnnnnit: @mihoXt shhhhh keep it on the dh's
[3:07:41] Saitistreamy: I agree with BANNING dhs lol
[3:07:45] Solushun: its just gunna fuk over his mana
[3:07:48] NightMunchies: holy
[3:08:03] NightMunchies: coulda been over lol

[3:09:01] Solushun: that was sketch at first
[3:09:04] Solushun: rdruid wins!
[3:09:11] NightMunchies: holy fm! thats tied
[3:09:14] runnnnnit: love to see a warrior win
[3:09:16] McLarge: It's an Arms Warrior just double cleaving the whole game
[3:09:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that was wild, the one DH was down to 1% health
[3:09:35] NightMunchies: war was just going nuts
[3:10:34] michaelss_: can you check if he changed from ebon
[3:10:49] McLarge: DH/Destro/RSham is really strong
[3:10:51] Solushun: i suprised it doesnt just end with rdruid being oom
[3:11:08] mayfire15: did he play it that game?
[3:11:13] NightMunchies: chib i think they mad they lost that 1
[3:11:20] Reizzy42: did kroto run the same build?
[3:11:32] NightMunchies: yeah
[3:11:37] NightMunchies: unholy
[3:11:41] NightMunchies: no frost
[3:11:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Does ebon fever speed up all the superstrain stuff?
[3:11:59] j_bar111: @notmes did he play the same build again?
[3:12:07] runnnnnit: @NightMunchies as a war main, i couldnt imagine trying to round up the cleave on an all pro team
[3:12:13] McLarge: DH/Arcane is a little awkward with an RSham, I think
[3:12:21] Vigi9413: did echo 3-0 i had to leave
[3:12:35] NightMunchies: lol
[3:12:37] waitimdesyncd: mesZerk2
[3:12:39] NightMunchies: yup
[3:12:42] seraph_wow: <3
[3:12:45] Vigi9413: you should do stuff like this more mes
[3:12:48] ArtofAzeroth: Always have to support you bro
[3:12:48] wukii1707: Its nice for us in EU :D <3
[3:12:48] Vigi9413: you have a lot of knowledge
[3:12:51] runnnnnit: @Vigi9413 yes
[3:12:57] waitimdesyncd: we are only here cuz you are :D
[3:12:58] dubbfiend: do we foresee any DH nerfs?
[3:13:02] silones123: hey @notmes
[3:13:06] Reizzy42: honestly i prefer hearing your perspective
[3:13:09] michaelss_: do you think this build is specifically into cleave or would it be good into caster too
[3:13:11] jondoe2239: which talent would you drop to put a point into morbidity, defile?
[3:13:11] NightMunchies: not 1 dk damage
[3:13:26] waitimdesyncd: dhs are fine guys
[3:13:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Death sweep could use a nerf in PvP, I think
[3:13:30] McLarge: DH has some broken stuff for sure
[3:13:33] waitimdesyncd: mes has played too much mesidan
[3:13:34] AdrecoTV: how can they make class changes during the middle of a tourney
[3:13:39] ArtofAzeroth: Plus, I prefer hearing you over eiya who knows nothing about arena when compared to you
[3:13:40] dubbfiend: pvp changes inbetween AWC cups happened before?
[3:13:48] NightMunchies: no defile stick with Deth and decay
[3:13:48] nrdoubleu: I’m usually asleep when the stream is playing I woke up and am watching your stream for the first time. overall thank you for an amazing voice that keeps me asleep
[3:13:50] honsou2: whose build is that?
[3:13:51] McLarge: A Fire Inside + Cleansed by Flame is hella broken into DoT specs for example
[3:13:53] NightMunchies: death
[3:13:55] bibitooo: Hopefully dk gets a 200% boost to festering and AMS shield for melee damage for 5x
[3:14:06] bibitooo: :(
[3:14:12] waitimdesyncd: ebon fever is like a plaguebringer effect anyway, and clawing makes him ranged, seems lowkey smart maybe
[3:14:18] runnnnnit: betting on the war ,#
[3:14:25] NightMunchies: go frost for dk burst is unreal with 13k str
[3:14:30] honsou2: dk wont get buffed but maybe other melees get nerf and we can still play our class
[3:14:34] Vigi9413: well this is something you don't see very often a DK and a warrior in the same arena
[3:14:37] NightMunchies: 68% mastery
[3:14:39] Vigi9413: arms makes me sad
[3:14:49] NightMunchies: arms is beast
[3:15:00] bibitooo: We should get an armor boost tbh
[3:15:12] Reizzy42: do they ever swap shaman?
[3:15:38] NightMunchies: dks using wrong pvp talents
[3:15:40] runnnnnit: i play arms every day and it doesnt suck, but its not good.
[3:16:00] NightMunchies: i play arms its frigging beasty
[3:16:07] McLarge: Is Coffey dual wielding Shadowmournes?
[3:16:15] honsou2: isnt arms the highest rated melee in shuffle?
[3:16:20] honsou2: maybe dh still higher
[3:16:35] runnnnnit: @NightMunchies not when you play 2 mages
[3:16:35] NightMunchies: arms is
[3:17:00] NightMunchies: well if u play 2 mages  arms gets smashed
[3:17:23] NightMunchies: too many spells to keep up
[3:17:49] the_kchain: how close was that
[3:18:04] NightMunchies: omg
[3:18:05] Xcyyted: krotos build is very weird tbh, clawing with ebon fever ? some new strat?:P
[3:18:21] honsou2: Why is he playing DK no other classes to bring?
[3:18:21] NightMunchies: dk loses it
[3:18:29] McLarge: Living to the second Darkness was insane, but unfortunately just not enough
[3:18:31] eMBeaR64oz: he moved out he musta not had the bing bong earthen wall weak aura
[3:18:33] NightMunchies: wrong build i think
[3:18:45] sunileif: points!
[3:19:05] NightMunchies: should be doing more damage than that
[3:19:11] seven_proxies: seven_proxies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[3:19:11] StreamElements: seven_proxies just subscribed for 17 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[3:19:20] honsou2: they should sub in a warlock
[3:19:29] MutationsTv: hes also spamming death strike
[3:19:33] NightMunchies: lock hell yeah
[3:19:37] mayfire15: and he is getting trained
[3:19:38] Wrbursch: wonder if WW would be better
[3:19:51] jondoe2239: why doesnt he just play blood
[3:20:01] NightMunchies: loses runes that way  need to gain runes
[3:20:04] jondoe2239: haha
[3:20:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood pog
[3:20:17] runnnnnit: if you sharpen mortal strike into teir set proc into mortal strikie into teir set proc
[3:20:19] Onca4242: It's nice seeing a different class... don't even know when the last time I"ve seen a warrior is lol
[3:20:24] NightMunchies: blood in AWC that b the first
[3:20:25] seven_proxies: No worries!
[3:20:31] michaelss_: I was watching his globals, he barely ever could fit clawing globals, maybe one ever 10-15 sec, wouldn’t plaguebringer be more value in that situation
[3:20:54] NightMunchies: if AWC took bloods i would do rating that way
[3:21:03] longdongliam_: hola
[3:21:04] NightMunchies: im beast in blood
[3:21:09] healmeshammy: you dont even see dh/war on ladder much
[3:21:15] waitimdesyncd: ebon fever is a plaguebringer effect that he doesnt have to keep up every 10 sec
[3:21:19] NightMunchies: almost 2m hp
[3:21:32] runnnnnit: warrior is taking fatal mark
[3:21:46] honsou2: theres no way they lock in the same comp again
[3:21:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: "A fitting final resting place..."
[3:21:53] NightMunchies: i would arena or solo in blood
[3:21:56] runnnnnit: just like me
[3:22:00] waitimdesyncd: wait a sec, if the uhdk just did bdk type damage, why not play the bdk and be immortal?
[3:22:09] NightMunchies: idc if it gets me a rating so be it
[3:22:10] honsou2: Merce still on the bench NotLikeThis
[3:22:42] runnnnnit: if you play blood dk in ssf your reported
[3:22:46] michaelss_: blood is not doing as much dmg as the unh and then they lose to rdru on mana
[3:22:47] honsou2: @NightMunchies dont play blood dk if u want rating
[3:22:53] im_nandy: big purges gonna be really good here
[3:23:02] NightMunchies: i should start playing blood again 2011-12 i owned in blood after that lost intrest
[3:23:32] NightMunchies: i play frost
[3:23:32] ArtofAzeroth: Tank specs shouldn't be allowed in arena imo
[3:23:34] chachio_dk: i like how his health goes down when he is deathstriking
[3:23:36] runnnnnit: blood dk is for people with tiny pps
[3:23:44] sunileif: only thing is if you solo q as blod people will throw if your on their side
[3:23:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Gnomes are pure evil
[3:24:01] sunileif: hush gno is awesome
[3:24:08] sunileif: gnomist
[3:24:18] ArtofAzeroth: We can hear you
[3:24:19] dblhelix1: u r here
[3:24:20] im_nandy: ya
[3:24:26] sneakynaki: You are indeed here
[3:24:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: HE SAID THE THING
[3:24:56] NightMunchies: if they allow tanks in arena why not
[3:24:58] runnnnnit: goi warrior
[3:25:11] Reizzy42: they are just looing to one shot with evoker purge right?
[3:25:24] NightMunchies: i see a guardian druid in arena
[3:25:24] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:25:48] NightMunchies: seen many druid tanks in AWC
[3:26:36] push_site: is NA next?
[3:26:52] honsou2: They got a warrior/warlock on bench and lose 3 in a row with DK Kappa
[3:26:55] NightMunchies: No tomorrow i think
[3:27:18] waitimdesyncd: feels like a throw not going bdk LUL
[3:27:19] NightMunchies: this is almost over
[3:27:49] NightMunchies: lol dk playing funny thats NOT FUNNY
[3:27:52] cbzx: kroto is a livelord
[3:28:02] dankgamer97: Buff dk armor Sadge
[3:28:02] MutationsTv: i mean every game has been domination why dont they switch comps
[3:28:07] afriKENx: kinda crazy how good at multiclassing fuseton is
[3:28:16] driftwood_tc: is that a fucking ashbringer Kroto has transmorged?
[3:28:19] afriKENx: i didnt even know he healed
[3:28:32] afriKENx: @driftwood_tc yeah TR has all the mogs available
[3:28:47] runnnnnit: kroto kiting like a god
[3:28:55] NightMunchies: warrior survives
[3:29:05] mayfire15: fuseton needed to commun earlier
[3:29:08] babaka137: hi
[3:29:16] NightMunchies: dk cakes it
[3:29:29] NightMunchies: too much for em
[3:29:32] bibitooo: Kroto is not helping for our armor buff, hes lasting too long :9
[3:29:36] swolecolemole: wow these dk armor changes were definitely a good idea!
[3:29:38] NightMunchies: no runes to heal
[3:29:38] jondoe2239: do all the 2h melee dps have access to legendary axe in awc?
[3:29:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: That warrior was going ham
[3:29:45] buttbutterson: his grips seemed really bad
[3:29:45] nemeuxs: na play today?
[3:29:46] honsou2: @bibitooo what?
[3:29:52] runnnnnit: my warrior boy pulled it throught
[3:30:09] NightMunchies: play frost might switch tunes
[3:30:16] runnnnnit: im a new fan
[3:30:22] bibitooo: Hes holding, so instead of a 50% buff, we might get 10%
[3:30:28] chachio_dk: notice how the warrior is healing the same as the dk spamming deathstrike
[3:30:33] NightMunchies: unholy is not good it looks like
[3:30:34] dankgamer97: Blood dk would prob be better KEKW
[3:30:35] waitimdesyncd: i feel like bdk would own against this specific comp
[3:30:43] UnknownUrza: UnknownUrza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[3:30:44] StreamElements: UnknownUrza just subscribed for 26 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[3:30:45] cbzx: i thought the replays were doing slomo LUL
[3:30:50] honsou2: @bibitooo hes not holding anything he just got murked 3 games in a row
[3:30:59] cbzx: ohh haha
[3:31:02] NightMunchies: blood would actuall make the dk survive
[3:31:08] NightMunchies: actually
[3:31:33] NightMunchies: hes not charging his runes always draining em
[3:31:54] honsou2: @NightMunchies charging his runes?
[3:32:03] NightMunchies: need to be 100% at all times  hit spells that dont take runes
[3:32:10] NightMunchies: yeah
[3:32:28] honsou2: what universe are you in atm
[3:32:32] NightMunchies: dks have runes for spells cant deathstrike without em
[3:32:51] j_bar111: Deathstrike takes runic power not runes
[3:32:53] NightMunchies: like healing with No mana
[3:33:06] sunileif: :O
[3:33:10] NightMunchies: rune-runic i call em
[3:33:16] sunileif: denied
[3:33:23] NightMunchies: runics but i short for runes
[3:33:41] honsou2: @NightMunchies NotLikeThis  my brain
[3:33:43] NightMunchies: played dk for 17 years
[3:33:43] j_bar111: Runes and runic power are not the same thing
[3:33:53] ArtofAzeroth: Then you're saying it incorrectly where you're the only one who knows what you mean
[3:35:00] sunileif: !kappagen

[3:39:13] push_site: what time you guys play tomorrow?
[3:39:14] sunileif: i remember it a lil diferent
[3:39:47] honsou2: only thing that feels different since last patch is actually DK being worse LUL none of the other changes rly made anything different
[3:39:52] sunileif: hmmm rouges do need a nerf or 10
[3:40:13] Jonnybads: free mes, buff dks
[3:40:18] hadoukyn: was legion or bfa the last time dks were relevant
[3:40:46] honsou2: @hadoukyn prolly the overall best melee of bfa, which is why it has been nerfed again and again since
[3:41:09] dimitridq: ww supremacy baby lest fucking go
[3:41:16] hadoukyn: yeah I remember at the end even smexxin played it right
[3:41:17] jondoe2239: dk was very strong in s3 SL
[3:41:24] professor02: first season bfa was crazy
[3:41:24] honsou2: yeah but wasnt the rework mid s1? or was it for s2
[3:42:13] mayfire15: you think outlaw dh would be good?
[3:42:14] Ghostfumes111: When you'll see as many DKs in AWS as you see rogues, then you can say that it's good!
[3:42:22] Ghostfumes111: AWC*
[3:42:37] hadoukyn: I dont recall such period lol
[3:42:52] mayfire15: did y’all not like outlaw dk? i seen y’all played it for a few games last night
[3:43:06] mayfire15: seemed like bad ques tho for that comp
[3:43:20] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:43:47] mayfire15: surprised you don’t try any ret stuff
[3:44:07] hadoukyn: ww sub is so scary
[3:44:26] kreyzy8: holy priest is pretty efficient vs ele because of pom right?
[3:44:30] Reizzy42: is there a better healer into this comp?
[3:44:32] push_site: hpal mana is so bad
[3:44:39] kreyzy8: yeah that too
[3:44:52] goatedsp: no? Holy paladin isinsane has way better utility
[3:45:20] mayfire15: wonder who hoolibang lost to
[3:45:45] hadoukyn: lost to rmd
[3:45:45] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:45:55] Reizzy42: that bop wa sinsane
[3:46:30] Reizzy42: do they evcer swap h pal i feel like h pal would flop hard
[3:47:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP ele
[3:47:34] hadoukyn: ww is so miserable to play this expac even with sub rogue on your team
[3:47:52] xkayne: jayti swap
[3:47:57] honsou2: @hadoukyn ??? ww is insane
[3:47:58] push_site: rip my 75k channel pts
[3:48:05] Reizzy42: mage?
[3:48:10] dimitridq: warlock  ele
[3:48:11] mayfire15: dh maybe?
[3:48:12] isseswagger: enhance maybe?
[3:48:13] im_nandy: rld i think
[3:48:28] Ghostfumes111: Lock Rogue I think
[3:48:29] mayfire15: dh lock
[3:48:30] miftzor: rmd? idk
[3:48:39] dimitridq: i mean ele feels super tanky
[3:48:40] goatedsp: Paly isnt as bad as youre making it out to be lmao it has way beter utiliy than priest, double bop lay on hands, daybreak on 45 seconds cd with tier. priest is mediocre
[3:48:43] dimitridq: and u pump
[3:48:51] dimitridq: just need the warlock to finish
[3:48:52] Reizzy42: does MLD or like MLP beat it?
[3:49:00] hadoukyn: @honsou2 have you played it actually? chasing everyone all the time, your cds getting ccd all the time you get to hit someone decently for very short time
[3:49:02] xkayne: watch the swap
[3:49:32] mayfire15: dh might just make the holy priest run out of healing
[3:49:45] honsou2: @hadoukyn yeah thats the playstyle
[3:50:11] Reizzy42: is there a class that counters sub and WW?
[3:50:34] mayfire15: demo actually might be good into this
[3:51:05] Ghostfumes111: Holy fire op xD
[3:51:18] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[3:51:21] maybethistimepls: did i vote
[3:51:31] McLarge: DH is pretty much never the answer to a Rogue. It's a very disruptive melee with CC immunes, but it's not nearly durable enough while stunned to deal with Sub Rogue. You'd be much better off playing an Orc Warrior/Ret Paladin if you want a melee that's good into Sub Rogue
[3:51:31] maybethistimepls: no damnit
[3:51:33] mayfire15: who did they lose to?
[3:51:37] dimitridq: fire mage???
[3:51:39] Reizzy42: so like would double rogue pally help counter then?
[3:52:03] miftzor: lontar can always pull out the ultrabull if needed
[3:52:19] Reizzy42: i think arcane would be better thgen fire here right?
[3:52:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: GO GO GO
[3:52:32] McLarge: Fire does huge burst damage
[3:52:38] mayfire15: fire..
[3:52:41] mayfire15: wtf
[3:52:51] Reizzy42: right
[3:52:52] McLarge: Fire is only considered bad because of how much damage it takes
[3:52:56] Reizzy42: you run arcane if anythign right
[3:53:04] hadoukyn: prob for caut
[3:53:47] Reizzy42: what are the best classes at killing WW monk tight now? i feel like thats your only kill
[3:53:50] mihoXt: saw some ppl playing with glasscannon lately
[3:53:54] mihoXt: *without

[4:04:04] maybethistimepls: ret outlaw hpal is something luminosity would play into this
[4:04:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I have seen some ret hunter going on the ladder action, not sure if this team can field that comp tho
[4:04:47] Reizzy42: is brains team playing this season?

[4:06:39] wukii1707: it's our pleasure <3
[4:06:41] MoneyKrusher1: Swapxy is going to explode the priest... Whats your take on it?
[4:07:19] Ssolemn: Can't finish FeelsBadMan
[4:07:21] Reizzy42: i coudl see sub punishing WW
[4:07:36] hadoukyn: maybe if they played sub fire
[4:07:42] dblhelix1: Love the coverage. Appreciate the insight so keep it coming :)
[4:07:45] kreyzy8: ret would def be very good vs this
[4:07:49] dimitridq: sub to take out th eww
[4:07:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ret makes sense to me, then bring in an rdruid or resto shaman
[4:07:54] kreyzy8: that seems like the clear answer
[4:08:53] silverplay1304: I wanna see whazz lose
[4:10:03] hadoukyn: echo in such a good spot everyone can play their main
[4:10:07] dubbfiend: I remember when Kawhi played outlaw/ret in SL to counter the rogue meta
[4:10:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Send it!
[4:10:12] hadoukyn: I dont wanna face chan on lock more than anything
[4:10:49] NPBeharry: what do you think it would take to beat echo (comp, players, etc)
[4:12:05] NPBeharry: outlaw has shadowy duel?
[4:12:14] NPBeharry: oh he’s suv
[4:12:17] NPBeharry: sub*
[4:12:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: outlaw rogue things, yep
[4:13:04] hadoukyn: oh no
[4:13:24] Xeliumimar: can cdew even q ww/outlaw cause trill plays both specs
[4:13:28] NPBeharry: what’s the cd on serenity
[4:13:31] WagwanBombaClatBomba: its over for wwf

[4:15:01] WagwanBombaClatBomba: but i swear the monk threw with his serenity use
[4:15:12] hadoukyn: wonder why they popped the big goes on brunhitty only
[4:15:29] WagwanBombaClatBomba: brunhity also went night elf
[4:15:30] NPBeharry: thank God this wasn’t a sweep
[4:15:32] WagwanBombaClatBomba: he was orc befor
[4:15:41] hadoukyn: he couldve held the serenity for swapxy and kill him 20s later
[4:15:46] mahz: Love seeing a WW though. Way more interesting than watching rmp, rmd
[4:16:14] sunileif: fuck rmp
[4:16:25] sunileif: vote hooligans!
[4:16:28] Reizzy42: doesnt he always have evasion though?
[4:16:29] mahz: ^

[4:17:27] MedtnerFangirl: wild
[4:17:41] Reizzy42: in your opinion what is the strongest comp right now?
[4:17:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chaos bolt 185K, chaos bolt 195K
[4:18:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pretty awesome, all that damage
[4:19:12] honsou2: warlock will win the tournament
[4:19:15] honsou2: if not swapxy then echo
[4:19:51] Reizzy42: so they have to kill brunhity here now right?
[4:19:52] kreyzy8: the guardian tooltip is bugged
[4:19:55] kreyzy8: it shows 3 mins every time
[4:20:55] Reizzy42: now they shoudl be able to kill the h pal now right?
[4:21:24] hadoukyn: I think he dueled next
[4:21:27] kreyzy8: every CD affected by CDR is wrong LUL
[4:23:26] hadoukyn: bop before duel
[4:23:55] Reizzy42: hoolibang looks really goode
[4:23:57] Reizzy42: right now
[4:24:01] dblhelix1: crazy
[4:24:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Windwalker hero raising hell
[4:24:15] im_nandy: damn, didnt think swapxy team would get recked that hard
[4:24:29] MedtnerFangirl: bruhhh
[4:24:31] Vigi9413: haven't watched AWC do NA and EU ever face each other
[4:24:33] hadoukyn: cant wait to see if chan can make the difference
[4:24:40] honsou2: they shoulda played lock all along was too hard on this map
[4:24:53] Reizzy42: i wonder if sub rogue lock or like sub rogue ret would be good into them and they punish the WW
[4:25:24] kreyzy8: I think he is an outlaw only rogue
[4:25:26] Reizzy42: the lock did look better then the mage though
[4:25:30] overinee: no way this team have a chance against echo
[4:25:47] honsou2: now its UH vs outlaw/arcane RMP LUL ill predict a 0-3 for dk
[4:25:50] DouzySham: any chance there is going to be an official EU vs NA final match this year?
[4:26:58] honsou2: its trimaz outlaw arcane
[4:26:58] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[4:27:15] Vigi9413: they really need to bring pvp back to blizzcon it's too hype not to
[4:27:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: People playing for fun, horrible
[4:27:21] hadoukyn: yeah
[4:27:35] mihoXt: @Vigi9413 there was pvp at blizzcon
[4:27:46] Vigi9413: wait there was?
[4:27:52] hadoukyn: just for run trimaz?
[4:28:01] honsou2: @hadoukyn y
[4:28:33] honsou2: inb4 i called that last blizzcon was the last blizzcon
[4:28:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: The new president of Blizzard was in e-sports
[4:29:02] Vigi9413: i would think the community would keep it going
[4:29:11] Vigi9413: but idk how community driven prize pools would be
[4:29:21] MrSt33z: Mes. we need all the top Arena streamers to fund a new, non-bliz arena game
[4:29:38] Vigi9413: is AWC blizzard backed? or community drive
[4:29:42] bones1088: im hopeing they are just cleaning house so they can build the new team they want .... but im not convinced thats the case \
[4:29:47] honsou2: @wEiRdO_dUdE technically both the NFL league and the OW league suspended on her tenure Kappa
[4:30:06] goatedsp: pvp wont thrive until the base UI looks like what you see on the screen for AWC and all addons are banned
[4:30:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: @honsou2 The NFL suspended what?
[4:30:17] mihoXt: @bones1088 would make sense, like marketing and ads around the tournaments is SO bad
[4:30:32] honsou2: @wEiRdO_dUdE the esports one
[4:30:41] MrSt33z: I don’t know. I’m not so sure. the world outside is literally a collection of menus. the open world aspect of the game is inconsequential
[4:30:49] sentokiisarg87: esports at Blizz are over. good or bad it’s definitely over imo.
[4:30:50] ConchubarOD: Is there ever anything in game about awc or mdi/tgp?
[4:30:53] MrSt33z: to arena specifically
[4:31:05] Syndrose10: DinoDance
[4:31:05] Vigi9413: AWC was a great way to counteract Covid... do you think we can get back to what it was before? or would you even want that
[4:31:13] jondoe2239: think he just means the party/arena frames
[4:31:17] Aroty: force players to actually have to track enemy CD's and not have addons for every single thing
[4:31:26] mihoXt: @ConchubarOD no
[4:31:45] MrSt33z: the simplification of the UI only works if the classes are simplified
[4:31:47] sentokiisarg87: maybe the community steps up like RTWF.
[4:31:51] Vigi9413: i think it's unrealistic to force players to track every cd with all the cd's that there are
[4:31:55] hadoukyn: events like this are reviving the game so esports are not dead imo even tho there are not many ppl watching it
[4:32:07] Aroty: @ConchubarOD They should totally promote these tourney's from in-game with links
[4:32:10] jacob_the_mage: esports isnt going anywhere imo
[4:32:21] MrSt33z: with the current state of class design, and the high number of abilities in the game, I’m afraid you really wouldn’t be able to aware of anything to a significant degree
[4:32:27] Vigi9413: viewership is way better than youtube
[4:32:33] Vigi9413: moving to youtube would've killed it
[4:32:39] Aroty: @Vigi9413 That's the point, it brings back more dynamic games that are less scripted and more fun
[4:32:45] sunileif: cant wait for street fighter to be inthe olympics
[4:32:49] hadoukyn: thank god they moved it back to twitch lol
[4:33:04] ConchubarOD: @Aroty It seems like a free win to me, I was asking cos I felt like it must be there and I just skipped past it etc.
[4:33:36] ConchubarOD: yt is just so much better, chat on that stream is useless on both and rewind for comp stuff is amazing
[4:34:00] hadoukyn: hit them with the frost mld lol
[4:35:13] Jonnybads: av1 would be amazing for twitch
[4:36:11] WagwanBombaClatBomba: lol
[4:36:19] WagwanBombaClatBomba: meta full ccd
[4:36:42] bibitooo: you could get an intel gpu for pennies for av1
[4:37:10] Jonnybads: @bibitooo thats what I use, i got an arc 770
[4:37:19] bibitooo: Yeah, dual gpu, intel to encode, normal gpu to game
[4:37:28] bibitooo: Yeah
[4:39:09] hadoukyn: is limps playing cleanse
[4:40:28] Szain3: DinoDance
[4:40:37] mihoXt: we should all try to form teams and participate in the next cup so management sees engagement
[4:40:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP mage
[4:40:46] hadoukyn: daymmmmn
[4:40:46] the_kchain: that was huuuge
[4:41:26] MrSt33z: @mihoxt good idea

[4:42:57] bibitooo: DH nerf confirmed
[4:43:00] hadoukyn: ofc
[4:43:05] Ghostfumes111: Of course
[4:43:14] sunileif: dk nerfs is the place to start NODDERS
[4:43:17] bibitooo: Rogue getting a 2% evis nerf
[4:43:22] honsou2: ofc now they let Merce play when i predict the dk to lose Kappa
[4:43:24] hadoukyn: make dks support class
[4:43:29] Ghostfumes111: Meanwhile, we see a rogue in every team xD
[4:44:01] bibitooo: I'd say DKs are getting a slight armor or stam buff, like 5%
[4:44:02] mihoXt: it was a blade dance not a death sweep btw
[4:44:34] mihoXt: oh nvm my bad
[4:44:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Infernion was rocking hard in open bracket
[4:44:52] hadoukyn: infernion > merce
[4:45:32] reavethederp: how come we dont see many thug cleaves
[4:45:41] sunileif: chibaku gon win
[4:45:50] sunileif: more votes for chibaku
[4:46:02] hadoukyn: ye
[4:46:06] bibitooo: Infernion got this, I need to win this bet
[4:47:15] goatskull123: so they ditched the DK?
[4:47:16] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[4:47:24] McLarge: Infernion playing Rogue/Lock is interesting considering he was in Ven's chat a couple days ago saying he thinks DH/Destro/RSham is the best comp in the game
[4:47:25] Syphrosz: i fucking hate when outlaw rogue is on meta jeeeeeesus
[4:47:58] kreyzy8: did he DC??
[4:48:01] honsou2: @McLarge the best melee and the best caster = best comp, seems legit
[4:48:04] McLarge: Merce afk?
[4:48:13] kreyzy8: merce hasn't moved
[4:48:15] hadoukyn: good ppl
[4:48:15] Xeliumimar: it's a fake dc
[4:48:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: ooooh DC
[4:48:23] McLarge: @honsou2 Best melee is Outlaw
[4:48:39] bibitooo: Merce got IRL Stunned, thats how op rogues are
[4:48:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say the rules are to keep going even if a DC happens
[4:48:58] hadoukyn: he baack
[4:49:21] nikthevoker: when yu come back in cmbat its so fuced
[4:50:15] hadoukyn: WHAT
[4:50:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: WHOA
[4:50:20] kreyzy8: omg that's so sad
[4:50:23] honsou2: clapped
[4:50:28] mayfire15: two fire portals
[4:50:28] bibitooo: Will do anything for channel points
[4:50:28] hadoukyn: triple rift
[4:50:34] mayfire15: he got lucky with price
[4:50:39] mayfire15: procs
[4:50:47] memil141: no
[4:50:48] sunileif: dark pact
[4:50:54] afriKENx: FLAME RIFT
[4:50:56] kreyzy8: lmao the portals
[4:50:58] honsou2: shouldnt have waited for the DC Kappa
[4:51:00] mihoXt: LUL
[4:51:00] memil141: dang nroo
[4:51:03] memil141: nroo
[4:51:05] memil141: bro
[4:51:07] Drathimos: no idea how those rifts work
[4:51:33] reavethederp: oh
[4:51:33] Drathimos: rip
[4:51:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Infernion pushed his buttons, it looked like
[4:51:49] goatskull123: i try to AMZ them on my DK and still die sometimes
[4:52:17] memil141: insan bro!!!!!
[4:52:42] hadoukyn: there are 10s missing
[4:53:01] honsou2: EU awc so far: Warlocks are gods and then hoolibang
[4:53:33] nikthevoker: so much overkill
[4:54:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah we saw a lot more hits from those rifts
[4:54:31] memil141: ty brooo
[4:54:38] reavethederp: is na today too?
[4:54:40] michaelss_: why is no one running dh/dk into destro
[4:54:40] waitimdesyncd: cheers was fun
[4:54:49] waitimdesyncd: gl tomorrow
[4:54:51] ConchubarOD: was fun, as a non pvper the extra explanations of what happens is nice :)
[4:54:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was great, thanks!
[4:55:06] honsou2: @michaelss_ because warlock is better than dk so they run warlock/dh and you lose
[4:55:09] ArtofAzeroth: Mes, I'd thought you'd be asleep during the day at this time since you're a night streamer
[4:55:16] honsou2: or warlock rogue and you lose too
[4:56:27] hadoukyn: isnt that single bolt rift doing same dmg as a chaos bolt
[4:56:55] sunileif: needs more mm/bdk/rdru
[4:59:33] honsou2: outlaw seems pretty outmatched by dh here imo. But not in all comps just when both have a lock
[5:00:26] spayvee: @hadoukyn regular bolts like 150-200k rift bolts around 60-80k i think
[5:01:20] honsou2: trimaz in torubkle
[5:01:31] honsou2: i knew he was dead as soon as i saw the camera show him across the map
[5:01:32] nikthevoker: did he die with vanish again?
[5:01:49] bibitooo: he was looking for torubkle by being so far away
[5:01:51] nikthevoker: err
[5:01:54] nikthevoker: evasion
[5:01:56] nikthevoker: not vansihs
[5:02:04] honsou2: this is interesting for echo in the finals, chikabu tensei sleeper win by benching DK Kreygasm
[5:02:12] nikthevoker: evasion not vanish
[5:02:14] Reizzy42: would evasion of helped there?
[5:02:15] McLarge: He definitely had Evasion there
[5:02:35] nikthevoker: ok thats what i was wondering
[5:02:39] honsou2: yeah they said on broadcast a few rounds ago evasion icon is bugged
[5:02:42] nikthevoker: you never see it go off
[5:02:46] krome2dadome: yo
[5:03:09] honsou2: i think they just said "outlaw has no cooldown on evasion anyway"
[5:03:40] McLarge: Should just be Versa/Mastery
[5:04:17] nikthevoker: 50k extinction LUL
[5:04:54] americanmoses18: dayum
[5:04:55] krome2dadome: died through healthstone and swiftmend KEKW
[5:05:28] nikthevoker: ifernion got kicked
[5:05:30] reavethederp: supatese has a crazyunderstanding of the game
[5:05:31] McLarge: What's the CD on NS?
[5:05:34] nikthevoker: he didnt have CS
[5:05:45] bwfp: did twice the healing has the same mana left, just druid things
[5:05:47] honsou2: @McLarge 1 min
[5:06:38] honsou2: chibaku tensei wins the tournament by using the ancient technique of playing warlock and DH while theyre both the most OP specs
[5:07:31] Awhopkins: Who plays on Lava Lava?
[5:07:32] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:07:39] honsou2: isnt echo playing the exact same team
