[0:56:37] Wrizzik: people trying to find Goblin rogues and stuff
[0:57:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I read an article once about it, and some people think the guild perks led to a kind of toxic guild leadership fairly often
[0:57:15] MoonwalkingAngel: ppl complaint i think that new guilds didnt get new guildies cause they had no buffs
[0:57:26] Cfoug: mass rez started as a guild perk before it became a spell didnâ€™t it

[0:57:30] metavahn231: oh god is this the start of holy power?
[0:57:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like the people back in the day would spam anyone and everyone to advance their guild perk levels, stuff like that
[0:57:52] Verdell263: There is so much hype in DFW for the Mavs. Luka MVP is a real chance

[1:00:04] Ghoost172: god i loved holy radiance or whatever the new holy ability in cata is called
[1:00:12] rosina_scarlett: below where you are
[1:00:22] mozavich: @Verdell263 as someone who has played a holy paladin in every expansion for the last 20 years, yes. it's the expansion where holy paladins start to go downhill. if you understand the current state of holy paladins in wrath, you'd know what i'm referring to :)

[1:01:16] Verdell263: @mozavich Oh I do, but I have very found memories of Cata as well. Solo healing fights with my guild. I have good memories
[1:01:42] mozavich: in mop, they start adding clunky mechanics to holy paladins. it felt bad. they eventually fixed it with grace of light or whatever but it took awhile.
[1:01:56] Verdell263: But yes. Holy Power is and has been garbage for Holy Paladins
[1:02:10] mozavich: ayy
[1:02:21] Wrizzik: How goes wedding stuffs?

[3:38:03] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  tindral lol XD
[3:38:31] Rottencoarse: it did
[3:38:44] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee yeah some guild was at 6k try or smth
[3:38:46] Rottencoarse: XD
[3:39:19] Rottencoarse: Les is the man!! :)
[3:39:40] soth_klf: That is such a weird comment to make. As if the last raid tiers didn't kill guilds. It is not rwf fault. Lol. Also more and more casuals are trying out mythic. If you are still not killing tindral at 200 pulls. Then you are simply not good enough
[3:40:30] TechMythril: @soth_klf  bad take
[3:41:27] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  probably one of the worst decisions imo
[3:41:41] Plague_GG: tbf if they do nerf it they have the chance that it is the wrong time and one guild or another gets upset
[3:42:02] soth_klf: Also Anduin was the most nerfed Boss of all time
[3:42:21] soth_klf: Post nerf
[3:43:07] Plague_GG: @soth_klf shit I remember doing 500 pulls on H Rag and Leishen back in the day, guess we werent good enough Kappa
[3:43:26] Folgrum: harder game = less subs from casuals, gg blizz
[3:43:59] TechMythril: well competitive overwatch isnt a thing anymore so yeh the need worlds first
[3:44:26] soth_klf: I agree, RWF is a big thing for blizzard.
[3:44:44] soth_klf: So what else are they supposed to do?
[3:45:07] TechMythril: make all raids easy and then have seperate raids for RWF

[3:50:18] soth_klf: Question remains, how many guilds are supposed to kill the raid in what timeframe?
[3:50:59] Thoreya: SoD, Cata, retail, we got all forms of new wow
[3:50:59] TechMythril: imagine how big the player base would be that anyone can log on join a raid and get gear without having to sweat or having to be in a discord.

[3:53:53] saehti: Bring back scrolls of int/stam etc with less effect ofc
[3:54:03] xmedpakx: they legit design weak auras mid raid to compensate for the amount of stuff goin on in each fight, imho that seems a bit too much

[4:00:28] kaeildk: @Towelliee Do you think that Blizz should stop testing the entire raids like they currently do with the final boss?
