[0:57:39] fomaredin: EXP BUFF UP?
[0:57:47] Molvonos: @cazhually Most of the talents are passive.
[0:57:53] Molvonos: There's no bloat to be had.
[0:58:05] Molvonos: Tuning tho, unsure.
[0:58:13] Elijahss: You are gonna miss out on a lot of xp by doing this now, 4k per turn vs 8k
[0:58:37] geokouts: wait after reset to do the quest for more xp
[0:58:52] Elijahss: more then 3% could ever add up too
[0:58:56] Molvonos: Ya'll talking about that extra sweaty shit.

[1:03:00] falldrgn: also a super clever title with Aunduin struggling
[1:03:17] TeejayOCE: I'd say BC LK & Legion were top 3, BFA 4th, maybe DF 5th sure
[1:03:22] TheGamingDead: don’t forget you peacock

[1:06:30] Elijahss: @silentknight190 about 2 hours
[1:06:43] belfastcl: what blizz has over ffxiv is that they've made it so they can make you play some of THEIR other games
[1:07:01] Wulfgrym: horde? aren't there like 3 people playing horde? LUL
[1:07:02] formal_____: out of bfa, shadowlands, dragonflight unpopular opinion but I had the most fun with BFA nothing will ever beat the atmosphere of faction v faction again. Truly one of the best feelings
[1:07:38] syngred1: retail is the sweatiest version ever right now
[1:07:51] syngred1: any type of content u do unless u get 10000 addons 1000 weakauras and dedicate ur whole day its unplayable
[1:07:53] SamuraiWillZ916: the 1% is just louder because streaming and what not
[1:07:59] Elijahss: @syngred1 same with Classic
[1:08:04] ravenwingz0405: Islands were fun
[1:08:09] jerseyfive: probably because the majority of developers working at blizz were 1% at that point
[1:08:11] TigbittiesXXL: L take on BFA KEKW
[1:08:16] Calphurnious: @formal_____ I did have a lot of fun coming up with some fun builds with the azerite powers on launch

[1:29:45] OGaxelaw: i find the guilds im in start losing people cause mythic plus
[1:29:52] tirraldra: Literally just catering to the 1% of players
[1:30:02] honkblarg: my guild just killed tindral on heroic last night
[1:30:14] belfastcl: some people stick around the game mostly because of their guilds, when those dies off they have less reasons to stay
[1:30:18] deanbeo: Makes are killing it right now @donchamp
[1:30:24] deanbeo: Mages*
[1:30:27] jmalmin: Mythic raiding is not for everyone. its for the few actually.
[1:30:30] rymerre: maybe then need to stop caring about the race
[1:30:34] delaine: That they don't even sponsor
[1:30:36] tirraldra: LUL
[1:30:47] tirraldra: Our mythic guild died after painsmith
[1:30:49] tirraldra: big sadge
[1:31:36] im_capy: I think RWF should have a separate tier, its just 2 weeks long, and whoever can clear it clears it, and then it's over. Something like that

[1:31:51] notdustinx: TR for RWF
[1:32:14] restokin: The fix is to make the last few a dps check & have the last gear unobtainable until the 2nd or 3rd week
[1:32:46] heydjsz: maybe give them their own realm like arena tournament
[1:32:54] im_capy: RWF is a good marketing tool as well, so they can't just stop it cold turkey. Something does need to change obviously though
[1:33:05] Sollice: @im_capy How can that happen. Blizzard doesn't host RWF community does
[1:33:32] im_capy: @Sollice Blizz supports it alot on the back end
[1:33:57] Uther_The_Lightbringer: sad and true
[1:34:00] falldrgn: @heydjsz Then you delve into world first retail, and tournament realms.. its adding more to the mix
[1:34:13] Sollice: Ehh. They are tuning the raids. They aren't doing anything else
[1:34:34] im_capy: @Sollice agreed, but its tuning to the .0001%
[1:34:41] mcloveinu716: true true
[1:35:03] mrsuflakis: git gud
[1:35:06] heydjsz: @falldrgn true i suppose
[1:35:08] Molvonos: That's especially true with the last bosses.
[1:35:27] Molvonos: Raza, Sark, Firakk.  We can't/couldn't get those on fucking clear, and our raid team just petered out until the next season

[1:37:05] tirraldra: 232?
[1:37:20] spacemunky114: as a filthy solo casual, I got all the way through heroic on amirdrasil. if a guy like me can get through it? you know something is fucked
[1:37:21] Shaner29: 226/252 i think
[1:37:29] Amarlian: So what do you think. should it be just LFR, Heroic, and Mythic @Towelliee ?
[1:37:34] blackknightwing19: Yea you got more loot and higher ilvl items
[1:37:35] Dudutoolbox: these guys are writing a post about the game longer than a bacherlor thesis LUL

[1:42:17] Wulfgrym: @91Niki towHi
[1:42:33] Dudutoolbox: @im_capy LUL
[1:43:27] TheItalianStallion321: no they are not. considering mine was obsolete in 10.2
[1:43:31] Sollice: Yeah they use to do that and people went bat shit
[1:43:39] TheItalianStallion321: so i had it for about 6 weeks
[1:43:39] kw3nk: I liked the MoP cloaks, legendaries now feel like a money sink
[1:43:41] Sollice: Thunderfury, Sulfuras, Benediction
[1:43:51] filos0phia: heck yes
[1:43:57] filos0phia: I hate that 0.1% drop rate
[1:43:59] Dudutoolbox: isnt that bascially the way classic did it?
[1:44:03] Molvonos: Yea, I loved those qquestlines.
[1:44:04] filos0phia: I had to do it for green fire on warlock way back when
[1:44:05] OGaxelaw: i do think more guild help needs to go into getting the one person a legendary
[1:44:15] barkerdoa: what’s wrong with legendary just being an extremely rare drop where you shit yourself when you see it. not a quest line
[1:44:16] Molvonos: And the fact in WoD you got a statue for your garrison when you completed your ring.
[1:44:18] Molvonos: Was even better.
[1:44:21] AsijhaZwei: GoldPLZ
[1:44:39] OGaxelaw: i mean its in the title "legendary" its not supposed to be easy or everyone eventually
[1:44:43] Twanacus: yea mop lego was sick and had u dip into all aspects of the game
[1:44:45] jmalmin: Got my axe last week. I have been killing Fyrakk every weak on HC since  the axe started to drop. Tok me a long time to get the drop I needed.
[1:45:03] Amarlian: Hot take, I hate that legendaries are tied to professions. The costs just suck!
[1:45:14] barkerdoa: it’s like what they did with epics. nothing special about purple anymore
[1:45:17] tr4ncetv: does a common single diamond el guapo for a legendary Akama (allowing me to make a Mint), seem like a good deal?
[1:45:24] Titannborn: helllll yaaaaa
[1:45:27] Titannborn: we bac
[1:45:28] TheItalianStallion321: i havent played retail in about 2 months. i started playing again this week. i literally see no evokers. what happened?
[1:45:33] Titannborn: what’s up all
[1:45:33] TheItalianStallion321: i dont even see AUG
[1:45:36] OGaxelaw: everyones got the axe  i see them everywhere even hunters rolling around with one
[1:45:41] faisal965: when is the 100% xp for sod ? and is it for all characters less than 40 ?
[1:45:42] Molvonos: Aug is everywhere.
[1:45:45] Titannborn: w#hats up big T
[1:45:48] filos0phia: @Twanacus those legos and mounts are the best and most memorable by far
[1:45:53] Molvonos: They're still considered the third most sought after class for all they bring.
[1:45:57] rymerre: blizz is just messing up all over...the state of pvp is super bad too
[1:45:58] REDSUNDERGROUND: Any news on s4 yet im dying on this road 5 toons at 3k io
[1:46:00] Titannborn: when guild raiding gnome ?
[1:46:01] TheItalianStallion321: i have not seen 1 aug in 2 days of doing content
[1:46:12] jmalmin: Its end of expansion. Mythic guilds do break up at end of expansion most years. New guilds will pop up next expansion.
[1:46:14] brewgamingtv: i've been saying they need to do something about raiding in general
[1:46:25] Molvonos: @TheItalianStallion321 Dunno what to tell you then.  Your sample size is skewed.
[1:46:33] Bowwjack: @Towelliee mythic raiding should 100% be flex like the rest of the difficulties
[1:46:49] filos0phia: I had one guild break on a boss but the GM was a nutjob so I don't count it lol
[1:46:49] brewgamingtv: it's bad when u have a boss that nukes a raiding guild
[1:46:52] im_capy: yup
[1:47:08] im_capy: SL alone was a guild killer LUL
[1:47:21] TheItalianStallion321: @Molvonos its possible.
[1:47:30] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee PSA: OBS scence is still on "reading"
[1:47:35] Dudutoolbox: I Wonder if mythic raiding would even exist if world fist wasnt a thing
[1:47:36] filos0phia: I'd love to see player numbers during and after the Race
[1:47:39] OGaxelaw: they focus on arena and mythic plus
[1:47:49] Molvonos: @Dudutoolbox Mythic raiding would definitely be a thing
[1:47:56] filos0phia: I wonder if they see such a drastic fall off of players that they can't afford to focus on it
[1:48:09] filos0phia: oh interesting, I didn't know all that about Dragonflight
[1:48:14] im_capy: they put effort into skill trees, they put effort into UI, they put effort into dungeons......just nothing for raids
[1:48:18] Scarhearth: The tuning gets frustrating even as a casual aotc guild lead
[1:49:12] 91Niki: @Towelliee overlay
[1:49:14] filos0phia: I haven't played since I killed Sylv so I haven't even seen dragonflight yet
[1:49:43] im_capy: On a more positive note....hows SoD Warrior going LUL
[1:49:58] jmalmin: Dragonflight has been a good expansion, but I am looking forward to war within. :)
[1:50:25] im_capy: LUL understandable

[1:51:08] TheGiant99: Nice seeing you back in wow
[1:51:17] nusher1: I wasnt a big fan of dragonflight. Kept my sub for classic and SOD this past year.
[1:51:37] Molvonos: Its more 'pvp'

[1:51:46] Molvonos: Which is why the pve freeloaders were bitching
[1:51:56] rymerre: it looks good on twich for all of a week
[1:52:13] TheRonWeedsley: its def weird on a pve server
[1:52:19] im_capy: You called it
[1:52:23] kw3nk: My guild just wintrades in STV, we have a spot
[1:52:24] Elijahss: They should give twice the blood for non player kills in STV
[1:52:32] chrisrev: did the 100% xp buff  go through yet
[1:52:34] belfastcl: it was fresh and new, the golden combination
[1:52:39] filos0phia: if WoW removed PvP and stopped trying to balance for then spent all those saved resources on better PvE content, I'd come back to WoW instantly
[1:52:39] Elijahss: Most people didnt make it to 25
[1:52:40] beezelbuub: its just the mage farms that suck and the "spriest boomie only" meta
[1:52:44] AfKarrStormyOne: that's exactly what my husband said about Stranglethorn.  He did Ashenvale a lot, but said "oh this is all PVP...." and noped out
[1:53:17] ReptarRevised: Im excited to see what the 60 raids will be like with all the SoD runes
[1:53:22] TheItalianStallion321: all i did was farm SM to get to 40
[1:53:24] im_capy: Quarter 1 numbers are due soon too
[1:53:26] TheItalianStallion321: i hardly did any qyests
[1:53:28] raldrik: Classic 1-25 leveling progression feels so good. It feels like you get power increases inline with your time investment. It falls off after 25
[1:53:29] 3663Sharad: Fresh SNIFF
[1:53:29] TheItalianStallion321: quests
[1:53:29] Mehike06: too many retail players cant lvl the classic way lol
[1:53:53] Mehike06: three lvl 40s all SM grind lol
[1:53:54] YzieGG: yeah they want to keep the zoomer
[1:53:55] AfKarrStormyOne: a lot of people also have an inate hatred for gnomer from the original wow lol.  I cringed when I found out that was their choice for the raid
[1:53:56] filos0phia: dungeon spam is the best
[1:54:05] dpbdagger: 40-50 will be the same thing, im sittin in dungeons
[1:54:07] Dudutoolbox: too soon
[1:54:09] aimassistallen: questing gives more gold now tho
[1:54:15] elldub: I wanted to quest, but the zones were packed
[1:54:23] jamarky23: just search on mage and stockades on any realm..
[1:54:23] Molvonos: New Gnomer's just fine, since they made it so you cant get lost
[1:54:33] ZealotryTV: SM raid would have been a banger
[1:54:35] im_capy: every druid that farmed that in classic saw it was gnomer.....and died inside
[1:54:36] Molvonos: They'd do the same thing for Sunken Temple
[1:54:41] elldub: It was hard to get a tag
[1:55:05] jamarky23: i mean people min max the fucking fun out of the game and then complain its too easy
[1:55:06] Elijahss: "SOD started off with a bang and 4,535,307 characters were created in the first week! That's 450 new adventurers every min. 460,083 Characters have reached level 25 almost 10% of the population." from dec 25th

[1:55:51] im_capy: LUL
[1:55:51] filos0phia: @jamarky23 that's the best part of the WoW community tho: Theorycrafting
[1:55:53] im__herb: yes
[1:56:11] jamarky23: it is... the pve is a joke
[1:56:18] OttoCrozz: I think the idea was to use dungeons that didn’t get much love before. Turn the least ran dungeons into the raids. BFD, Gnome, and Temple being the least ran comparatively.
[1:56:19] TheRonWeedsley: so Les
[1:56:28] Amarlian: One disappointment for me this phase was how long it was until we got our first new rune
[1:56:30] filos0phia: classic PvE was always a joke tho
[1:56:53] rymerre: it never even felt like that...everyone just looked on wowhead for the runes
[1:56:54] Mehike06: I hated the new pally runes
[1:56:55] filos0phia: when classic relaunched the raids, people were beating them at like level 55
[1:57:01] Mehike06: well getting them
[1:57:18] jamarky23: @filos0phia Yeah but its essentially classic plus... an oppurtunity to not make it a joke. i dont think thats a valid arguement
[1:57:29] VeniVidiVici401TV: Have you done 1K needles yet
[1:58:01] nusher1: The issue about runes in P2, you have to be 40 to get majority of them. So P1 was more fun finding runes because you could get them really any level solo
[1:58:01] Moobot: Opening some Marvel Moonknight! If you want some Hobby boxes you can find them at these online stores https://bit.ly/3NSTERE OR check here for your local Hobby shops https://bit.ly/48mudAp
[1:58:02] Elijahss: See how much xp those turn ins are giving? 12.5% which would be 25% a turn in.
[1:58:12] jamarky23: yep...
[1:58:12] filos0phia: @jamarky23 if they're trying to keep it in line with classic tho just with fun things on top, I don't think they want to raise the diff
[1:58:17] belfastcl: @jamarky23 raids being easy is one of the allures of classic wow, and always was
[1:58:18] dpbdagger: @jamarky23 game dev basically said on twitter theyre not going to make any raids difficult for classic ever
[1:58:20] Molvonos: Yea, prolly
[1:58:21] Mehike06: like 44
[1:58:23] Molvonos: It's what we'll end up doing
[1:58:24] BigBadAzz1: Good morning, @Towelliee
[1:58:28] Mehike06: its hard to do at low 40s
[1:58:31] YzieGG: u can
[1:58:37] Mehike06: like 44-50
[1:58:37] xxlegitghostxx: I think they are making zul a raid
[1:58:44] Mehike06: ya
[1:58:54] filos0phia: @dpbdagger yeah makes sense, I would never expect SoD to be difficult, just interesting and fun
[1:59:03] Elijahss: ST got changed to 10 man in the code
[1:59:03] Molvonos: There's an undisclosed 20man raid for next season
[1:59:03] Calibur84: lvl 50 raid
[1:59:03] Mehike06: I think 60
[1:59:05] chinfu303: you can do cath till 42-43 then go zf
[1:59:12] Scarhearth: Last time i played classic i did mage aoe leveling in zul from 40-54 before exp fell off
[1:59:18] PhillyRhino: MC at 60, just making it 20 man.
[1:59:20] Elijahss: I think there might be 2 50 raids
[1:59:22] BlewGamingGroup: a lot of people want it to be BRD
[1:59:29] TheItalianStallion321: i thought the same thing @Towelliee but yeah there is another 20 man raid unannounced
[1:59:29] im__herb: next phase raid is 20 man as well as molten core will be 20 man
[1:59:32] Calibur84: Ah that makes sense
[1:59:32] BigBadAzz1: Blizzard tends to do that also
[1:59:35] PhillyRhino: it's rumored that Sunken Temple will be the level 50 raid.
[1:59:36] TheItalianStallion321: i think they just meant to say MC is 20 man
[1:59:43] Mehike06: im thinking sunken temple
[2:00:20] jamarky23: @dpbdagger  Well if thats the case then ppl who min max in sod are gonna be forever cringe
[2:00:34] im_capy: dam
[2:00:34] TheItalianStallion321: whoa
[2:00:38] TheItalianStallion321: lol
[2:00:44] filos0phia: is that SoD only?
[2:00:45] 3663Sharad: hooooly
[2:00:51] Elijahss: The 7th was before the phase
[2:00:52] TheItalianStallion321: thats a huge drop in a week
[2:00:58] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @SuperLost89 (warning)
[2:00:58] BlewGamingGroup: if they make sunken temple the raid ... they need to do some streamlining ... that place is a pain in the ass in its old form
[2:00:59] krayways: the 30-40 wall hits hard
[2:01:05] im_capy: I knew it was bad, but havent seen numbers until now...rough
[2:01:08] thmpr324: look at the most recent data? it has an uptick
[2:01:10] Calibur84: Lvling alts at the current xp rate is brutal they needed to do something
[2:01:17] YzieGG: but we have less alts now too
[2:01:20] thmpr324: 2024-02-21
[2:01:22] SuperLost89: can i post a link please? :)
[2:01:29] elredge: Phase 2 lack content, you can pre-bis in no time in the fe dungeons we have, you raid once every 3 days and thats it
[2:01:30] Elijahss: So the drop happened before phase 2, when people started raid logging their alts
[2:01:30] Mehike06: ill take it. love leveling alts lol
[2:01:33] dpbdagger: @Calibur84 100% buff coming literally today
[2:01:33] im_capy: D4 in a bad spot too, Blizz just hurting right now
[2:01:34] chrisrev: its because people are so fucking cringe about the gnomer raid. its so elitist who/what class gets in the raid
[2:01:35] PhillyRhino: watch today it sky rocket back up bc of the boost
[2:01:37] Nerzalus: Doesn't help that some of the new fun runes needed 40 or carries by 40s to get
[2:01:44] Molvonos: @chrisrev You have to.
[2:01:44] straightupphat: yeah we need a xp boost..... the leveling process is terrible and low level zones are pretty dead
[2:01:50] straightupphat: Also get rid of half the layers
[2:01:50] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:01:55] filos0phia: wasn't original classic made by one dude locked ina  storage closet?
[2:01:57] Molvonos: Not having enough ranged, for example, for the last boss, means you're not clearing it
[2:02:02] filos0phia: I hope SoD had more development time than that lol
[2:02:11] Hirukai: I had so much fun on P1, but I got to lvl max really fast, but couldnt get a raid group that was not gdkp, I had all pre bis and stuff, so I droped without even entering a raid.
[2:02:14] PhillyDilly18: PhillyDilly18 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 37 month streak! Thanks for all the great content! Looking forward to the War Within Alpha!
[2:02:17] ReptarRevised: @Towelliee I think for the future phases once you hit max level on 1 toon this buff should activate for all your alts. SoD isnt really classic so let us enjoy all the "new" classes
[2:02:19] Chelidda: SOD S1 made me try WotLK Classic, and I'm still there enjoying it a lot more than SoD S2
[2:02:34] Aquadriel: filos0phia that dude locked was the one who made the game work in current wow infrastructure, not the whole development.
[2:02:43] im_capy: @Molvonos after melee was dominate in P1 basically too
[2:02:50] Mehike06: thats what I did
[2:02:55] Mehike06: leveled 7 toons
[2:02:56] tumb_tack: You didnt stop aand pet the cat?
[2:03:00] elredge: @Towelliee It would be nice to get some sort of mythic + dungeon with badges farming to get some nice items, I mean with a large qty of badges so you realy need to grind the dungeons
[2:03:02] chrisrev: @Molvonos im not against needing certain comp. but the whole "checking Logs" wb, cons is so cringe man.
[2:03:05] Molvonos: @im_capy Melee damage is still dominate, the only thing requiring ranged is mechanics, not damage.
[2:03:06] Elijahss: The population dropped the minute GDKP got banned....
[2:03:12] AfKarrStormyOne: If I remember correctly, 40-50 was considered the Hell levels
[2:03:14] Calibur84: yeah after 40 it's a grind for sure
[2:03:29] chrisrev: TRUE
[2:03:34] theDirtyon3: I got my toon to 40 but my group isnt playing as much so its hard for me to get the motivation to lolg in
[2:03:35] belfastcl: that's not an L take, is straight up insane
[2:03:39] Aquadriel: population dropped becasue BDG disbanded
[2:03:40] TheItalianStallion321: a lot of players were doing GDKP....
[2:03:44] Elijahss: I am just saying there is a correlation
[2:03:47] thmpr324: 300000 people were mostly peoples 5th alt lol
[2:03:48] TheItalianStallion321: he didnt say L take he said hot take
[2:03:48] im__herb: gdkp got banned at the same time as p2 release
[2:03:52] Molvonos: They likely got purged due to inactivity.
[2:03:52] krayways: We lost 3 IRL friends in the SM-WALL. So the 100% exp will help for usre. YES DADGAMERS
[2:03:52] theDirtyon3: @TheItalianStallion321 not that much tho
[2:03:59] filos0phia: gdkp was just the rich get richer anyways, doesn't help casuals
[2:04:01] im_capy: @Molvonos ya, which sucks. You want to bring the better dps(or anyone really) but cant
[2:04:02] geokouts: f

[2:04:12] straightupphat: @Towelliee hey arent they adding a feature where you can get all P1 runes easier?
[2:04:16] Verdell263: @Molvonos No worries, that's what it was
[2:04:17] Molvonos: @Rougtos SoD
[2:04:25] TheItalianStallion321: @theDirtyon3 no, not 250,000 lol but theres people out there thtat probably refuse to farm gear and just want to buy it
[2:04:32] Rougtos: @Molvonos Whats that?
[2:04:36] theDirtyon3: @TheItalianStallion321 good riddance tbh
[2:04:41] im_capy: towByah

[2:05:54] PhillyDilly18: 19th is a Tuesday
[2:05:56] krayways: what drops the 19th kappa
[2:06:04] macgregorxd: Towelliee, I remember raiding with you on Windrunner US a guild named Pandemonium, we were the only two monks back on MoP you maybe raided with the guild a week or two and left… they were garbage
[2:06:07] AstridLory: im ok with the exp boost because is a seasonal server

[2:06:56] theDirtyon3: 10 years later he realizes its not you
[2:06:56] Nerzalus: budget towelliee
[2:06:58] filos0phia: the most interesting person I ever raided with was the guy from the MORE DOTS!! video
[2:06:59] im_capy: @Sollice LUL I saw
[2:07:07] macgregorxd: they were a streamer too, I remember watching them stream hah,
[2:07:11] Padarius: great value
[2:07:14] Libbzy: telling him to enter the bacon giveaway

[2:07:26] im_capy: @Sollice They got a new record for most money on the books for people not playing I think
[2:07:28] theDirtyon3: got WoW Catfished lmfao
[2:07:28] ZealotryTV: thank god. he was an absolute waste of money
[2:07:29] rymerre: gov assistance towelliee
[2:07:36] macgregorxd: maybe it was mal’ganis idk if you were ever there, if not I definitely got the Kirkland towelliee
[2:07:38] Sollice: 85 million in dead money
[2:07:38] SamuraiWillZ916: he got the "we got Towelliee at home"
[2:07:42] AfKarrStormyOne: ew
[2:07:49] elldub: Good, then the Vikes won't draft JJ
[2:07:52] theDirtyon3: Kirkland slaps though
[2:07:59] Verdell263: Priest or R Druid for next toon in SoD? Cannot decide
[2:08:01] PhillyDilly18: They thought they were playing with the south park towelliee actually
[2:08:02] ninedraft317: its looking like their is almost no trade market for justin fields
[2:08:07] stepchild5876: Servers go down already?
[2:08:14] jasperboy: WHAT
[2:08:16] theDirtyon3: Scooped from Echo

[2:08:32] Snabido: Liquid creeping into the EU market Keepo
[2:08:37] theDirtyon3: NA>EU
[2:08:38] SuperLost89: SuperLost89 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! hi
[2:08:39] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[2:08:57] theDirtyon3: @Towelliee SCipes tweet said as much too
[2:09:07] MattyNiceTV: I'm scared to see what my Bears do. If they keep Fields, Caleb Williams will be generational. If they draft Caleb, they might ruin him like they did Fields
[2:09:12] 3663Sharad: I wonder if Liquid bought him out from Echo
[2:09:13] TheItalianStallion321: so you're saying as a 41, almost 42 year old. i dont have a shot into Liquid?
[2:09:16] TheItalianStallion321: lol
[2:09:19] Sollice: Caleb is not generational lol
[2:09:23] theDirtyon3: its a banger
[2:09:37] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:09:52] Calibur84: Not wrong lol
[2:09:57] theDirtyon3: Just need preach outta retirement
[2:09:57] Calibur84: Old AF now
[2:10:14] macgregorxd: 40 is the new 20 bro
[2:10:15] filos0phia: imagine it's 2065 and everyone is 70+ in Race to World First
[2:10:16] ninedraft317: i perfer they trade the pick and get the draft captail
[2:10:18] theDirtyon3: They got noggie back as a analyist too
[2:10:21] TheGiant99: Where you running to
[2:10:33] im_capy: Liquid is a bigger org, so they got the bigger piggy bank
[2:10:45] subarUWUw: xp boost or after reset?
[2:10:51] subarUWUw: on*
[2:10:57] AfKarrStormyOne: started playing at release, am 45 in June ^_^
[2:10:57] Sollice: @ninedraft317 That's what they should do. Fields shouldn't be dropped yet.
[2:10:57] macgregorxd: and as they get older there’s no need for bio breaks between wipes they can just shit in their diapers
[2:10:59] timmauh: I thought to guilds were based off of PVP
[2:11:08] timmauh: top
[2:11:31] theDirtyon3: Liquid as an org gives him more exposure too
[2:11:37] theDirtyon3: Hes get to come to the US twice a year
[2:11:39] im_capy: the USD to EURO exchange rate is looking good right now too

[2:11:45] jasperboy: Isnt Tobo also a MDI player?
[2:11:54] cazhually: im surprised by that signing
[2:11:57] ambiotic: Did you see max's video on BDG, it was interesting
[2:12:00] Sollice: Put him in a Honda commercial!
[2:12:03] TheItalianStallion321: @jasperboy yes
[2:12:06] ninedraft317: @Sollice but its the bears they find ways to mess it up
[2:12:07] TheItalianStallion321: on Legendary i think?
[2:12:13] macgregorxd: don’t they also get paid to do the like wowhead guides and shit
[2:12:34] cazhually: bdg player pickups into liquid are coming
[2:12:45] ambiotic: Just the reasons why teams are dying and why its going to just be 2-3 teams for the foresable future. And why losing funding was such a deathblow with all the eu players they recruited
[2:12:51] theDirtyon3: @cazhually nah they already poached the good players last tier
[2:12:53] TheItalianStallion321: @cazhually oh 100% at least 1 or 2
[2:13:07] MattyNiceTV: @ninedraft317 exactly
[2:13:16] im_capy: He gets to come to Santa Monica, that alone is enough for some people to join LUL
[2:13:21] ambiotic: BDG lost Golden Guardinas
[2:13:24] ambiotic: Guardians
[2:13:37] macgregorxd: BDG died in his opinion was because they changed their hours from late night to prime time with liquids hours, and they jumped ship
[2:13:52] Thoreya: tobo joined liquid and left echo
[2:13:53] Thoreya: crazy
[2:14:00] im_capy: Not at all, it felt more like a "you can market us"
[2:14:02] Thoreya: he def got a bag
[2:14:07] macgregorxd: and some players left to liquid from BDG
[2:14:08] ChrisarN: Is the 100% xp live now? In EU aswell?
[2:14:11] mouhammed_: has the exp buff dropped yet?
[2:14:13] theDirtyon3: Yall act like this is the first player to switch sides between Echo and Liquid KEKW
[2:14:23] theDirtyon3: Naowh did this twice already KEKW
[2:14:28] ambiotic: Well i guess cloud 9 was interested in bdg so it fell thru
[2:14:33] macgregorxd: that’s what maximum said, but I agree with you though
[2:14:40] filos0phia: I thought at one point BDG was one of the most heavily funded guilds? It was a meme in our guild how rich they were
[2:14:58] Kneckt: towOof towOof
[2:15:09] ambiotic: Well his big thing was they were not good enough and eventually all the raiders saw it on the walls, and once they lost money it was clear and most jumped ship
[2:15:09] Moobot: Opening some Marvel Moonknight! If you want some Hobby boxes you can find them at these online stores https://bit.ly/3NSTERE OR check here for your local Hobby shops https://bit.ly/48mudAp
[2:15:09] theDirtyon3: @filos0phia thats was before the RWF started back in Legion
[2:15:13] ambiotic: ie: sloot ect
[2:15:27] macgregorxd: I don’t disagree, but maximum definitely was sugar coating the reason they died
[2:15:27] Sollice: Sloot didn't jump shit he retired
[2:15:29] AzedaNA: Show me the money
[2:15:33] filos0phia: @theDirtyon3 ah makes sense, I've been out of the loop lol
[2:15:35] cazhually: method is doing well enough to compete money wise
[2:15:36] Thoreya: does echo make a lot of money tho?
[2:15:39] macgregorxd: because no one’s gonna compete with liquids income for the US market
[2:15:40] marineboi1288: marineboi1288 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Hell ya 2 years strong loveing the streams good sir
[2:15:44] Nerzalus: towelliee funded guild when?
[2:15:45] Herzenliegen: lol
[2:15:45] theDirtyon3: @Thoreya Yes
[2:15:51] ambiotic: If Sloot thought they had a chance he would prob stuck around, but he saw the writing on the walls
[2:16:10] theDirtyon3: Sloot was just burnt out it had nothing to do with winning or not
[2:16:11] TheItalianStallion321: Sloot had enough thats why he retired
[2:16:15] PawgersHC: How was the Ripz stream this past week
[2:16:16] TheItalianStallion321: that guy worked 20 hrs a day
[2:16:18] Sollice: @ambiotic Ehhhh I dunno. He has become more disillusioned with WoW for a while.
[2:16:19] Thoreya: @theDirtyon3 interesting, company itself is still new. good on them to pay players and also make revenue
[2:16:20] TheItalianStallion321: on wow shit
[2:16:47] macgregorxd: why do you think max would say that then? talking out of his ass or trying not to expose that they bought their players lol
[2:17:08] theDirtyon3: @Thoreya they only have the raid and mdi to worry about and can funnel all the rev into the org again. Alot easier than liquid with all their staffing
[2:17:20] ambiotic: they got paid but nothing like liquid
[2:17:22] AzedaNA: "We will pay you in exposure"
[2:17:43] Sollice: @macgregorxd There is nothing to expose. It's like any other job you get paid more somewhere else you go
[2:17:44] rymerre: thats cuz they are
[2:17:58] macgregorxd: sure, I agree
[2:18:15] theDirtyon3: its no secret that liquid buys/pays their players
[2:18:17] ambiotic: Every tier they lost their top players to liquid and echo so what are you going to do
[2:18:19] JQ47: I think that chat is misunderstanding Max's point
[2:18:21] MysticRaven_: got to think RWF as an esport if you dont have the money you either get bought out or leave
[2:18:22] im_capy: Capitalism, love it or hate it
[2:18:27] AgentM2610: its why professional sports have caps, otherwise the rich owners would win all the time
[2:18:29] Sollice: Why do we keep using the term "buy" players
[2:18:30] theDirtyon3: and the players SHOULD leave a smaller guild to make money
[2:18:56] filos0phia: @Sollice cause eeveryone has a number, right?
[2:19:01] theDirtyon3: @Sollice its just weird I agree, they signed them just like any other sports org
[2:19:14] ambiotic: BDG took most of pieces players when they split up, so when they struggled so much on smolderon it was over
[2:19:23] ambiotic: Max also said Lightee is coming back
[2:19:31] mizthebot: What do you reckon about 40 man raiding in sod?
[2:19:31] Sollice: @theDirtyon3 Right. They are professionals. They go where the money is like 99.9% of all professional people in any profession
[2:19:33] theDirtyon3: Coming to the US twice a year is pretty cool too
[2:19:34] cazhually: liquid should poach more echo players
[2:19:45] Exusprime: The youngest player in wow has joined Liquid, damn
[2:19:48] TheRonWeedsley: further up
[2:19:59] PhillyRhino: Further north up the road
[2:20:00] filos0phia: @theDirtyon3 the difference from sports is 99% of the teams in the league have no funding and two teams are backed by multi million dollar orgs
[2:20:04] TheRonWeedsley: other road
[2:20:37] theDirtyon3: @filos0phia your point? Sports have smaller teams too.. You dont hear the Athletics bitching...well maybe thats a bad analogy buty you know lol
[2:20:38] Kneckt: https://twitter.com/TheWindstalker/status/1765025693866610712 holly replied to taliesin regarding slow 10.2.6 news esentially
[2:20:39] Moobot: The new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[2:20:46] Thoreya: if he heals, idts
[2:20:52] Thoreya: oh, salary wise idk
[2:20:57] theDirtyon3: someone retiring?
[2:20:58] belfastcl: @filos0phia and in most sports leagues, the team that signs a player compensates the other team
[2:21:00] macgregorxd: money talks bullshit walks, I’m sure if there’s more money on the table you can grab almost any echo player
[2:21:00] TheItalianStallion321: "put em in the minors"
[2:21:04] Sollice: @filos0phia I am not sure I follow you. Again in ANY profession companies with more money typically have a higher talent level
[2:21:10] ambiotic: Ben (lightee) is coming in too
[2:21:10] im_capy: Is Trill still doing RWF too?
[2:21:14] JQ47: What's tobos role chat?
[2:21:18] Dragunstorm15: i heard max mention that ben might come back
[2:21:24] Thoreya: @ambiotic no way
[2:21:25] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:21:29] macgregorxd: absolutely
[2:21:34] JQ47: Trill is out for pvp @im_capy
[2:21:34] Thoreya: if ben comes back, thats so huge
[2:21:35] theDirtyon3: If Ben came back that would be HUGE for liquid
[2:21:38] shale93: liquid buying gingi Kappa
[2:21:39] ambiotic: Trill in PVP only now
[2:21:41] theDirtyon3: Trill hasnt played in 2 RWF
[2:21:43] Thoreya: trill is sticking to awc
[2:21:51] elldub: @sollice Yankess vs Royals?
[2:21:52] Kneckt: Holly on the slow 10.2.6 news: "Sorry? We have learned that not having news and deets is frustrating for our creators and players. Stick with us for a minute. Our goal is a bit o' fun. As always we are here to learn and serve. So to speak. 🫣"
[2:21:55] filos0phia: @theDirtyon3 amatuer sports are funded and players are paid. Look at League of Legends. They don't pay their academy players enough and because of that they have 35yo players on some of the LCS teams because they're the best the community has to offer.
[2:21:58] theDirtyon3: Ben is the GOAT
[2:22:11] ambiotic: I guess he wants to do it
[2:22:18] ambiotic: So prob worked out something for farm
[2:22:20] TheItalianStallion321: and would Ben be a tank? or dps?
[2:22:21] Thoreya: maybe he just wants to play
[2:22:32] theDirtyon3: @TheItalianStallion321 anything he wants tbh
[2:22:32] Sollice: @elldub I think Baseball may be the exception to that rule lol. Thats what happens though when you give players literal half a billion dollars
[2:22:41] macgregorxd: you got 10 mins before shutdown
[2:22:46] JQ47: I think Ben would lose money based off streaming. Kinda like dorki didn't go with liquid
[2:22:46] macgregorxd: you better move it 🤣
[2:22:48] Kneckt: same
[2:23:04] filos0phia: @Sollice perhaps we're arguing parallel points. I just see how having only two teams getting funding is bad for the longevity of the sport
[2:23:07] brewgamingtv: Yeah would be nice cuz they said it would be in march and well here we are in march
[2:23:11] warrenny: i love the idea of random patch one day
[2:23:14] drewetling: run go goi
[2:23:20] theDirtyon3: Raz
[2:23:21] Thoreya: nah trill played in first raid
[2:23:23] Thoreya: yeah
[2:23:28] TheItalianStallion321: @theDirtyon3 true
[2:23:32] Thoreya: died a lot as monk
[2:23:35] jarilrpg: he was all star WW in Raz
[2:23:39] ZuraResodium: Is the buff active in US alrdy?
[2:23:53] TheRonWeedsley: @ZuraResodium no
[2:24:02] JQ47: It's because trill had to go pvp after a full raid day the man was exhausted @towelliee
[2:24:09] Sollice: @filos0phia Oh for sure. I think it gets boring seeing the same two guilds every RWF. Not because they don't belong there but more competitors always makes things more spicy.
[2:24:18] TheItalianStallion321: that optional camp shit NEVER worked for me lol
[2:25:00] ncsu_riggs: 100% xp til 40?
[2:25:21] ambiotic: And then whats the point, that was his big takeaway
[2:25:24] TheItalianStallion321: @ncsu_riggs i think 39?
[2:25:37] filos0phia: @Sollice those other guilds also make up what is essentially the Academy or Minor Leagues
[2:25:42] silentknight190: did servers go down and come back up already?
[2:25:42] jarilrpg: @Towelliee the last tiers sloot was there, he even said he turned down pay so others could get some
[2:25:50] Dudutoolbox: as a  yankee fan you know that well LUL
[2:26:13] the_general01: sktelecomt1
[2:26:24] im_capy: TSM and 100 thieves
[2:26:27] CordovaGC: Do you think if the raids were 10 man that would make it better?
[2:26:41] filos0phia: I'd like to see those Minor League guilds get more support, even if it has to come from Liquid or Echo as an investment in their own future in RTWF
[2:27:05] ncsu_riggs: but win for what?
[2:27:06] eyemyor: Lets see a Tesla-sponsored guild.  Musk would be quite the unique team owner.
[2:27:13] macgregorxd: they have enough money to double their current pay and rock liquid and echo lol
[2:27:16] im_capy: they could offer you a new life in another country. Not everyone comes from the best living situation
[2:27:22] tirraldra: T, what did you do before becoming a full-time streamer?
[2:27:33] eyemyor: Musk certainly has fuck you money
[2:27:46] ambiotic: Plus, we already did that and it was this weird spilt in which 10 man guilds were not taken seriously
[2:27:57] Herzenliegen: LUL

[2:29:06] eyemyor: Max says "Liquid what?"
[2:29:19] AfKarrStormyOne: I miss 40mans, and I don’t.  it was hard to find a guild large enough to support full guild runs and often had to run joint, but it also gave some flexibility to utilize non ‘optimal’ builds/classes that helped retain the fun in playing.
[2:29:21] the_general01: yeah but what happpened with TSM in LCS, noone trusts Reggie anymore
[2:29:31] GiveLoveLive: questing after maintenance?
[2:29:38] Dudutoolbox: xp boost on retail or classic only?

[2:30:04] just_kirk_: So excited about the exp buff. Deleted my ally toon and am rolling horde. alliance was such a waste of time on Crusader Strike
[2:30:18] AzedaNA: I mean cutting the raids in half just buffed the loot because that is 20 less people to compete with
[2:30:22] Elijahss: 2 turn ins, I guess you only missed out on 24% of a level.  You did save time in a sense though if you wanted to get into dungeons asap.
[2:30:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: and when you get to naxx 40 you realize who those tag alongs are
[2:30:28] filos0phia: @macgregorxd he's playing a different world of warcraft

[2:42:49] dpbdagger: i was praying for july LUL
[2:42:57] warrenny: wow players are good are whining
[2:43:05] Wildfire_Gaming: drought only happens now when they make gearing too fast
[2:43:06] im_capy: WoW players complaining is the way of the world
[2:43:30] Synonymous: i just want new dungeons, so tired to recycled content
[2:44:14] ogGobblediguk: i hate when its like 7 or 8 quests and then just a weekly, lemme do a fuller questline
[2:44:26] Thoreya: @Synonymous ull get them in the new expac like always
[2:44:43] ogGobblediguk: i need more rep without relying on other players
[2:44:44] Thoreya: aint no way they makin new dungeons for a s4
[2:44:53] Zavier420: @towelliee Morning bro. How ya doing?
[2:44:59] macgregorxd: what was your favorite expansion?
[2:45:01] ambiotic: This raid was just brutal and punishing so it burnt everyone out. I think that has more to do with it than gearing
[2:45:17] Dudutoolbox: doesnt delux edition also give 3 days early access to launch?
[2:45:22] Amarlian: Please don't ruin the story of SoD for me @Towelliee
[2:45:24] macgregorxd: same!!!
[2:45:39] Elijahss: I might dabble in the beta, but not much more than that
[2:45:42] warrenny: @ambiotic dude what? it was the easiest raid in df
[2:45:52] ogGobblediguk: BC wouldve been better with dungeon finder involved
[2:46:03] MattyjTV: @ambiotic ive been raiding like 7 times a week since it came out, so ive been really enjoying it
[2:46:14] Synonymous: like i dont mind like 2 dungeons being recycled per season but not a full lineup. its so lazy
[2:46:16] Aryranth: When the hell is this server gonna be up
[2:46:31] Thoreya: 3 day longer marathon
[2:46:32] Thoreya: pog
[2:46:43] theDirtyon3: Frist three days is ONLY leveling though
[2:46:45] theDirtyon3: First*
[2:46:50] the_general01: @Aryranth my manz....
[2:46:53] Zucchey: i wonder how many people they enticed for that 3 day early start
[2:46:55] ogGobblediguk: i need better dates, fixing to request the whole weekend hahaha
[2:46:55] newkingcody: time to get disappointed by the vault
[2:47:01] Dudutoolbox: so weird that even wow now started dong early access to launch
[2:47:10] Kneckt: i am so ready for another towelliee subathon

[2:48:09] Herzenliegen: With the launch issues they had with DF im good waiting the three days
[2:48:10] Elijahss: Oh, crazy.  Even mining and herbing?
[2:48:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: i always buy the boxed collector edition but i picked up the ultimate already for the beta access
[2:48:17] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  oh no crafting on the early access that's nice tbh
[2:48:22] theDirtyon3: its gonna stagger the impact on servers too
[2:48:32] theDirtyon3: I think this will be a good thing too
[2:48:42] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[2:48:42] Elijahss: Enchanter are OP then
[2:48:51] macgregorxd: that would be a huge economic explosion lol

[2:49:47] ottebrand1989: it's with stupid reset
[2:49:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah we dont have it yet EU reset is tomorrow also
[2:49:55] Elijahss: @theDirtyon3 enchanters can just hold there green and blues, and bank the extra
[2:49:56] ottebrand1989: yes
[2:49:57] ogGobblediguk: easy prof capping to many auction house farmers to be stupid exspensive
[2:49:59] th3janitor: yeah reset torrow
[2:50:13] theDirtyon3: @Elijahss i dont think greens and blues are gonna drop my guy
[2:50:15] ottebrand1989: they should have released it last week when the announced it
[2:50:35] Elijahss: @theDirtyon3 no gear will drop?  that seems wack

[2:52:13] theDirtyon3: slash s
[2:52:16] Dudutoolbox: if they had pulled of an early access 10 years ago  the playerbase would have rioted
[2:52:17] greywind317: sod
[2:52:21] im_capy: SL story line LUL
[2:52:24] Molvonos: I REMEMBER STRUGGLING TO LEVEL AT THE BEGINNING OF DF, SIR.
[2:52:33] stbaran_95: wonder if we can lvl with follower dungeons
[2:52:35] the_general01: as long as the servers are stable you could potentially get all yer tanks done in 3 days
[2:52:39] raldrik: I think the biggest advantage is the economy of getting first crafting mats and recipes more than gear and levels.
[2:52:42] byrdeen45: i have my lego axe ill be good
[2:52:50] Elijahss: Realm list is up(not that it rly matters)
[2:53:01] ZombieBrigade: end of may

[2:53:09] ZombieBrigade: phase 3  is about right
[2:53:17] macgregorxd: whats your opinion on SoD I’m considering playing it since mythic raiding is over for me now
[2:53:32] theDirtyon3: thats all you need to do is make the mats not available and the gear non disenchantable

[2:54:26] greywind317: Sod is fun for what it is tbh. @thedirtyon3
[2:54:36] Elijahss: so you can mine
[2:54:39] Elijahss: let's go
[2:54:40] Gawldy: yeah, can collect it all
[2:54:41] YzieGG: EZ
[2:54:47] theDirtyon3: yeah they wont let that happen
[2:54:54] theDirtyon3: we would riot
[2:54:54] TheGiant99: How do you turn off skinning
[2:55:00] Dudutoolbox: mats are so expensive in the first few days. I made so much bank  at launch with herbralism
[2:55:10] Gawldy: it doest alter much, no different to the folks that work, not playing until weekend, not going to do that
[2:55:22] theDirtyon3: make gear nondisenchantable and boom EZ
[2:55:23] Elijahss: @theDirtyon3 they will bc FOMO makes them money
[2:55:35] NiXProdigy: not sure, ion gave the 'no long term impact' response when asked about stuff like professions
[2:55:35] raldrik: so basically disable the profession trainers until official launch
[2:55:41] Gawldy: economy always bit higher regardless in first week
[2:55:49] Bito01: @Towelliee all they would have to do is disable it to be sold on the AH and then enable it when the offical launch happens but knowing blizz they won't do that
[2:55:55] belfastcl: i'd only worry about it if I was heavily invested in the economy side of the game
[2:56:01] SnackshotGod: prob a good time to start a new toon in sod with the boost eh
[2:56:02] kalithian2: turn it off?  you mean so you can learn another profession?  there should be an unlearn button
[2:56:25] Molvonos: @kalithian2 No?  Turn it off on Blizz's side of things, so you, as a player, can't do shit.
[2:56:30] macgregorxd: what are some of the most OP classes in SoD
[2:56:34] im_capy: tax write off baby

[2:58:51] zhr0: @Molvonos monkaS
[2:58:55] expbottles: twitter is just toxic
[2:58:56] filos0phia: twitter has less monthly users than twitch, reddit, or pretty much any other big social media site, idk why people care what gets said on that platform
[2:59:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: goes away at 40
[2:59:03] MoodyVanessa: up to level 39 the gold

[2:59:36] zhr0: @Molvonos I get it, why they're 25g I have no clue
[2:59:48] macgregorxd: someone give me an idea of an OP class for SoD and I’ll start leveling tonight
[2:59:55] ZombieBrigade: ya they messed it up i think
[3:00:04] Molvonos: @macgregorxd DPS warrior
[3:00:08] MaximumSerg: i think as soon as you turn its the 300 percent. doesnt refelect in the book
[3:00:10] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee i don't think youll see it till you turn it in
[3:00:13] ZombieBrigade: gold aint valued
[3:00:14] zhr0: I wonder if it's applied when the quest is turned in?
[3:00:17] ZombieBrigade: correctly

[6:00:36] im_capy: He has begged for them to reach out and talk to him so he can help in any way possible. He wants Diablo to do good, but just cant see it currently
[6:00:43] macmittens808: doing everything except just adding greater rifts back
[6:00:53] Brodih_: just crafting in LE is kinda more fun that D4 sadly
[6:01:05] Gungre: Blizzard's lucky I can't refund d4, or else I would. Highly disappointed in it
[6:01:06] dupapride88: any got any good tips for gold farming in SoD.
[6:01:41] d2darkalliance: its the problem with seasons as format. you Will always get its the next  thing and hype dies then not as expected

[6:02:41] The_Real_Alki: When they nerfed Necro pets and forced Necro's to be solo ... I quit.   Also, game is too grindy.

[6:03:14] TheGiant99: Some of those guys will never be happy
[6:03:27] filos0phia: the best feedback probably comes from people who both work on the game and go hard playing it in their free time

[6:07:35] hammack52: if you have the seduce on auto cast they will use it when ever they can in combat
[6:08:51] TheGiant99: I enjoyed last epoch alot but got to the point of what am I grinding for.....
[6:09:03] dokor: well how about that, rob is rank 1 on the barb ladder ^^
[6:10:06] edohran: What a Warlock should be in retail...  A literal demon god!
[6:11:08] filos0phia: one thing PoE has over last epoch still is the customizability of the late game difficulty. Running full delerium fragment juiced maps with a good Atlas passive tree is completely different from full Simu or Heist spam and they're all very relevant
[6:11:09] Spinecloud: when they add pinnacle bosses to last epoch, which is the next big goal, huge game changer
[6:11:15] filos0phia: but I think that'll come with time
[6:11:40] im_capy: Gauntlet race and still more people rather watch LE
[6:13:29] TheGiant99: LE viewership has gone down everyday
[6:13:30] eeeeeeeeeeeeerik: D2r
[6:13:33] im_capy: Be interesting to see how Microsoft goes about marketing their games over the next few years
[6:13:39] macmittens808: don't worry they'll fix diablo with a 70 dollar expansion Kappa
[6:14:18] im_capy: D2 gets more viewers a lot of times
[6:14:39] edohran: twitch viewership does not determine the popularity of the game though.. it is not a metric for game development
[6:14:59] AnimalCrackers_19: Who is this Rob guy is he like wudijo? I'm not familiar with Diablo community
[6:15:03] Bixster: to be fair. that also happend to D3, if you ignore kripps progress stream. D3 was super dead super fast.
[6:15:08] eeeeeeeeeeeeerik: The exp for d3 fixed that one.... But for d4... No way
[6:15:30] Dudutoolbox: some games arent just popular for streaming doesnt mean they do bad
[6:15:30] im_capy: yup, public opinion is a real thing
[6:15:43] eeeeeeeeeeeeerik: Would watch cow runs in d2 instead of d4
[6:15:51] edohran: I work in the game dev field, 3d asset design, and we do not worry about "we must make it twich likeable" on our titles
[6:15:52] Spinecloud: there's surely some metric showing twitch popularity to money earned to a company
[6:15:59] Alaquane: I'd rather watch helldivers or palworld over diablo
[6:16:21] netrom_: is there gold boost too??
[6:16:40] Alaquane: @netrom_ yes
[6:16:44] sixRlNGS_: yeah blame the healer

[6:23:12] TheGamingDead: To be honest I would probably not have purchased Last Epoch had I not been watching you stream talk about it.
[6:23:14] pm3488: What is the rotation for warlock tank?
[6:23:59] 91Niki: And if you take into account, games on steam, the more people wishlist a game, the further up it goes on the front page on steam, the more exposure it gets. So lets say, No Rest for the Wicked. If just 500 people in your steam wishlists the game, that is HUGE, that means the game will get exposed to MORE people on steam itself
[6:24:19] 91Niki: your stream *
[6:24:20] Dudutoolbox: isnt last epoch famous because of diablo?
[6:24:26] hamsquatch78: Last Epoch is great. I'm glad both Diablo 4 and it are out at the same time, both have their merits
[6:25:02] im_capy: Just like WoW is famous because of the MMOS that came before it
[6:25:04] 91Niki: That is why "smaller" companies are putting budget into sponsoring twitch streamers when their game is on steam. Because it = wishlists and free exposure on steam that way
[6:25:07] TheGiant99: LE and D4 are for different types of players
[6:25:52] 91Niki: Cohh always says it "If you like a game I play, EVEN if you aren't going to play it, WISHLIST IT! It gives smaller devs exposure on steam"
[6:26:36] Alaquane: sounds like a topical ointment
[6:26:50] Kneckt: oh fuck yeah
[6:27:01] BTiZZY_: how’s the xp boost feeling?
[6:27:08] im_capy: @91Niki Cohh is a wholesome good person
[6:27:09] 91Niki: KEKW

[6:29:35] Nokterian: Just watched Raxxanterax do the Gauntlet in D4 he did one run and he was done went back to LE towKek
[6:29:57] Alaquane: at 30? searing pain to pull, rain of fire to tick the debuff, hellfire
[6:30:48] TheRonWeedsley: lol
[6:31:15] 91Niki: @Nokterian rofl
