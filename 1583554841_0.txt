[7:53:26] Mrthurnis: thinking about switching to sulfuras are there any ally on that server lol?
[7:53:34] koltiska1: @Tepest  starting to think they want people to move servers
[7:53:35] Dabigin: they should come out with a website that allows guilds to volunteer to xfer, along with players that are solo without guilds. That way they could see whos xferring both on alliance and horde side and show what the numbers would be to the server they are allowing xfers to for free. Nobody wants a crazy alliance to horde ratio.
[7:53:53] doubled09: @Mrthurnis I am looking at the websites and it looks like its all horde
[7:54:00] YardRage: Mike Gone
[7:54:02] hellstrooper66: @Mrthurnis no mostly horde

[10:15:52] Dolphibg: knutW
[10:16:00] Goodzerker: Should I use Seal of Righteousness or command? Seal of Command is a great seal, but does damage based off your weapon damage. Additionally, it only can proc 7 times per minute. This means that if you have a faster 2H weapon with a lower damage range, Seal of Command is not worth using. Seal of Righteousness becomes better due to its flat damage added per hit.
[10:16:05] NostalgicDream: are the 2h mace and sword basically the same unless your  a warrior?
[10:16:18] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[10:17:06] Vame320: that DK failed his team
[10:17:08] AirstrikexTV: seal of right best for ret burst in pvp, seal of vengeance / corruption for consistent dmg
