[0:20:03] SirSlyDingo: they will lose hope in crowd sourcing a game for sure
[0:20:14] Vooklife: This guy thinks the Riot MMO is actually gonna happen KEKW
[0:20:23] Hento: is the riot MMO still a thing? I have not heard anything about that in like 10 years lol
[0:20:37] itsbubbzi: Last I heard was 2025
[0:20:57] elizabot_: you're in a NP SOD guild?
[0:21:08] SirSlyDingo: i dont like riots overall toxic community but they do make well produced stuff .. they are very quick on bug fixing
[0:21:18] LetsGoPolice: remember the 6months or so when people said WoW = "Waiting on Warhammer" KEKL
[0:21:23] itsbubbzi: Riot at least has some lore for an mmo to last hopefully

[0:27:10] GreenConure: this is a giga push week
[0:27:41] GreenConure: were going to try to push to 3250 atleast this week
[0:27:49] masterarkaine: arms warrior honestly. You hate hunters and priest is boring
[0:30:08] GreenConure: it's also a 2 button class
[0:30:14] czeksmyx: what server is this, I forget
[0:30:21] Hento: just spit on the ground.... lol
[0:30:34] zara1024: that's why feral is the superior choice NODDERS motw, brez, dispel for afflicted, hibernate for incorp
[0:30:37] masterarkaine: fury is meta though, you want lesser played i thought
[0:30:49] czeksmyx: Enhancement becomes actually super fun when you get Shamanistic Rage  and Maelstrom weapon
[0:30:52] Hento: @zara1024 then never do half of that :)
[0:30:55] GreenConure: they switch between arms and fury depending on key iirc
[0:31:18] elizabot_: im gonna try to make your fyrakk raid this week
[0:31:39] zara1024: @Hento I just wish the class tree was less of a mess so bear, cat, and boomkin could take dispel without needing 3 points
[0:31:51] zara1024: @elizabot_ yea you're welcome to come to our community raid Friday at 7pm EST to get aotc if you want
[0:31:53] Hento: I never ran dispel
[0:31:55] GreenConure: fury is super dependent on it's 1.5 min cds so on some dungeons it's ass
[0:32:11] Hento: the tree was a mess tho yea
[0:32:14] masterarkaine: yeah fury gcd is dogshit
[0:32:26] zara1024: @Hento I run it on bear if there aren't many dispels in the group
[0:32:30] elizabot_: @zara1024 okay ty i should be able to make it!
[0:32:34] zara1024: but you give up so much for it
[0:33:50] gorby14: charlesStare
[0:33:53] LetsGoPolice: so I might have dug myself into another hole. I have 66 primal mastery illusions now that arent selling
[0:33:59] elizabot_: i just got a new puppy 2 weeks ago
[0:34:00] zara1024: jimmy pls KEKW
[0:34:34] elizabot_: he's a mix from a rescue, they said shihtzu/pomeranian mix but idk he's got alot going on
[0:34:43] GreenConure: Rob I saw the ember drop... it's 100% dropping next week don't worry
[0:35:53] elizabot_: i knew this to be true before i got one but puppies are A LOT OF WORK
[0:36:22] gorby14: just get a tamagatchi
[0:36:38] LetsGoPolice: the funny thing was that I thought I was queuing for normal...but realized it was heroic once I saw the beams on the floor
[0:36:47] Shadow_x_Sabors: I mean you already have a cat right
[0:36:50] V170_: Yeah you basically have to watch puppies 24/7
[0:36:57] Princeofiowa: Deadge
[0:37:15] elizabot_: if you go on petfinder people foster dogs and kinda get an idea for their personality so they'll say things like "house trained/chill/good with cats" etc

[0:42:37] czeksmyx: so....maybe?
[0:42:41] RY3GUY: Retail you say...
[0:42:48] zara1024: @RY3GUY I've heard it's super boring, like 1 mechanic per boss
[0:42:48] ohgodspiders: gnomers good

[0:44:12] zara1024: @czeksmyx ladyhopeNotes
[0:45:17] czeksmyx: There's some class sepcs where you won't get an invite if you play them
[0:45:26] czeksmyx: heaven help you if you play a ranged hunter
[0:45:48] czeksmyx: Surv Hunters fuckin DESTROY all other hunter specs
[0:46:41] czeksmyx: one thing I don't like is all melee's end game gear is the exact same shit. 90% leather dual wielding claws
[0:47:07] zara1024: what healers are good in SOD chat?
[0:47:22] czeksmyx: Disc and Hly priest, Resto Shaman
[0:47:35] czeksmyx: Mage are decent healers
[0:47:43] zara1024: are *any* of the druid specs good? ðŸ˜­

[0:49:07] LetsGoPolice: its blue glow though
[0:49:09] LetsGoPolice: meh
[0:49:24] czeksmyx: I REALLY hope they take shaman tank notes for retail, because shaman tanks are bonkers
[0:49:48] czeksmyx: It aint blue glow, it's literal Owlbear horseshit
[0:49:50] LetsGoPolice: yes. protect Kaia nodd
[0:49:52] GreenConure: Banger
[0:50:01] zara1024: ok Draenor Angler is just ass, I've gotten 25 enormous sea scorpions in an hour and I need 100, and I have to do this 7 times with different fish Despairge

[0:51:05] czeksmyx: and it doesn't involve fuckin totems
[0:51:06] masterarkaine: its WoD timewalking this month, cannot escape Draenor lol
[0:51:12] Hento: SOD is just proof of concept at this point
[0:51:25] czeksmyx: I want DH to have a healer spec where they cut themselves to heal people
[0:51:34] masterarkaine: Agreed
[0:51:38] zara1024: more proof that druids are just better, we get 4 specs mbroEZ
[0:51:39] thestarsaredown: @czeksmyx So edgy...which means exactly on brand tbh
[0:51:44] Hento: luke warm, timewalking to level alts was fun as hell
[0:51:47] Hento: I kinda miss it
[0:51:49] GreenConure: Dh ranged spec would be nice
[0:51:57] RY3GUY: Late in the season time walking weekly would be nice for leveling alts
[0:52:02] czeksmyx: just throwin glaives

[1:15:49] Bunnys: you could on kick
[1:15:59] LetsGoPolice: it all changed once the elemental shaman nation attacked
[1:16:15] czeksmyx: although picking up shamanistic rage after you get the earth rune would be the biggest quality of life improvement I can possibly suggest
[1:17:09] czeksmyx: ye, it's a rune
[1:17:10] ohgodspiders: sham rage is a rune
[1:18:44] Bunnys: drainer?
[1:18:57] Huso833: TLOP was a p good album

[1:24:31] Princeofiowa: it's got thick skin, ok?
[1:25:12] zara1024: luckily I had a group of 5 when I first levelled in Vanilla, so we ran a lot of dungeons
[1:25:37] zara1024: so although I levelled as resto druid, it wasn't too too bad as long as we had a group going, but solo questing was miserable lol
[1:26:12] zara1024: ya if you can stay ahead of the quest level curve it's super good
[1:26:17] czeksmyx: That's why I suggested shamanistic rage. 20% DR and mana to full on a minute cooldown is nuts
[1:27:03] Huso833: They also made summoning nice here cuz lock gates can be used by anyone outside of your party too
[1:27:26] zara1024: have they retrofit summoning stones?
[1:27:35] Huso833: not the stones just the warlock portals
[1:27:35] czeksmyx: they don't work at all Sadly
[1:27:44] zara1024: oof
[1:27:55] Huso833: Yea my biggest question in classic is what the hell are the summoning stones for outside of dungeons
[1:28:16] Huso833: Yea just meet up there and it says the level of the dungeon
[1:28:30] czeksmyx: it's just part of the world. Draw a dick on one I guess
[1:28:47] zara1024: do NOT draw a dick on one D:
[1:28:57] czeksmyx: I'M GONNA DRAW 5 DICKS ON ONE NOW

[1:56:30] czeksmyx: that tanking rune I mentioned gives you a spell called "Spirit of the Alpha" Gives 45% additional threat to whoever you cast it on, and if you cast it another player, it gives you 20% attack power

[2:49:35] dankNstein_: but he wouldnt elaborate
[2:50:04] yrp01: I think towilee dropped some hints as well and that man is like super hooked up with blizz
[2:50:19] dankNstein_: towlie said that the fated raids might not be current raids or something
[2:50:22] dankNstein_: cant remember

[2:53:21] czeksmyx: but before that yeah
[2:53:32] yrp01: you going to go get the sleeping bag ?
[2:54:12] czeksmyx: sleeping bag quest chain has food that gives you 20% rest xp on your bar
[2:54:25] czeksmyx: a lot
[2:54:26] yrp01: yeah its giga busted for the consume
[2:54:29] czeksmyx: it's worth doing
[2:54:35] yrp01: it is 100% worth doing
[2:55:03] yrp01: you can do it later tbf
[2:55:20] czeksmyx: it will straight up send you into stupid places though
[2:55:25] yrp01: the 100% xp buff might put you on limited time to get it though because you need to slow play the consumes
[2:55:28] lildeathxd: boon your buff
[2:55:57] lildeathxd: 15s
[2:56:00] czeksmyx: 18 silver

[2:58:32] czeksmyx: late night TB buff takes forever
[2:58:48] Skinnymctoothpick: nepo baby
[2:59:02] czeksmyx: one of those mechanics wipes the raid though
[2:59:05] yrp01: i did it with the pumpers and it was like giga easy
[2:59:14] yrp01: like 1 shot didnt need to think
[2:59:21] czeksmyx: it's fuckin easy if you aren't a moron though
[2:59:25] UltimateTurtle7: this along with many other songs that you regularly listen to have been added to my daily playlists
[2:59:27] Huso833: BFD is crazy easy
[2:59:29] yrp01: yeah 100%
[2:59:32] Huso833: they got Weakauras for shit too
[2:59:40] Huso833: which is just replacing what DBM would do
[3:00:10] AyeAyeRon41: is everyone still dungeon leveling
[3:00:16] czeksmyx: most of the problem is avoidable damage
[3:00:17] yrp01: god i hope they do a fresh server for cata so i can just have a weekend of meme fun
[3:00:26] yrp01: dont super care beyond that though
[3:01:35] lildeathxd: if your gotta sleeping bad
[3:01:56] UltimateTurtle7: lookUp
[3:03:33] LuckyLuchiano: Sussy
[3:03:45] yrp01: I thought this was gachi KEKW
[3:04:18] czeksmyx: I think I've done the Sillithid quests maybe twice since Vanilla came out. Fuck those quests
[3:05:49] czeksmyx: please Mr. streamer, my ass hurts. Please stop making it clap
[3:06:07] czeksmyx: Sadge
[3:06:36] yrp01: thats classic korean tbf
[3:06:38] czeksmyx: Korean food lasts an hour and a half
[3:06:39] powerpoop5000: doyle
[3:06:50] TPLivewire: Holy shit, my brain is fried from trying to figure this shit out
[3:07:25] czeksmyx: someone gotta try the shake shake korean chicken sandwich they just got. I don't have shake shack in my state

[3:09:27] yrp01: 100%
[3:09:33] czeksmyx: ye, unless you wanna get griefed by both sides
[3:09:34] yrp01: doesnt matter cause pvp server though
[3:09:40] Huso833: yeah but people still might kill you
[3:09:48] yrp01: COCKA
[3:09:49] czeksmyx: I mean, Alliance still will
[3:09:57] czeksmyx: but Horde can't
[3:10:00] Huso833: It's a cool event
[3:10:15] yrp01: I hate wpvp in wow so its a Bedge from me
[3:10:37] yrp01: its apparently one of the reasons they are speeding this phase up is cause pve players are like yeah skip and numbers are dropping
[3:10:42] yrp01: reason for the xp buff
[3:11:40] yrp01: they will never make wpvp any good KEKW
[3:12:01] Hento: I liked the ashenvale thing, but it was a ghost town when I played after a few weeks
[3:12:42] Hento: after week 3 of sod its like uh I dont care  about the raid.... welp guess I will wait for patch.... but it took too long
[3:12:59] yrp01: you can never force PVE or PVP players to cross the threshold and have a good time tbf
[3:13:28] yrp01: yeah 100% they are going for that across the board now
[3:13:35] Hento: they want you to play everything lol
[3:13:47] TPLivewire: Yeah, they want you to spread your attention across all the versions
[3:13:48] yrp01: wow is being treated like an estate of games rather than just 1 game spend all your time here
[3:13:54] Hento: but who can be fucked playing classic/hardcore/wraith/retail
[3:14:01] czeksmyx: Ye, You play it for a while. Hit cap. Max out gear and then do other shit until the next 10 levels come out
[3:14:15] yrp01: Even maxxing out gear isnt a big deal

[3:14:21] yrp01: you just get decently geared then skip
[3:14:34] czeksmyx: fatigue death
[3:14:40] czeksmyx: the most precious of murder
[3:14:51] TPLivewire: Yeah from what I understand, very few layoffs occurred on the wow team, it was mostly Overwatch that got laid off. That's just what I've heard, not actual fact
[3:15:54] yrp01: yeah thats pretty much been confirmed in fact some people got relocated into the wow team from other teams
[3:16:04] Hento: valid lay offs overwatch got turned to dogshit
[3:16:25] yrp01: They dropped the ball in OW and Diablo PEPW
[3:17:05] yrp01: yeah i was just thinking that :D

[3:25:52] czeksmyx: Nah, BFD gear still useable at 40
[3:25:58] Hento: jeesus
[3:26:00] yrp01: yeah BFD is easy for gear and good XP as well
[3:26:02] czeksmyx: it's not insane, but it'll carry
[3:26:10] yrp01: the craftable stuff is still very good
[3:26:16] casualcarpet: isnt the point of pvp server to be chaos
[3:26:30] czeksmyx: ye, craftable leather gloves are BIS for dps enhancement shaman
[3:26:39] czeksmyx: from BFD
[3:26:44] casualcarpet: you could of owned him
[3:27:05] Vikinick: do you even have a kick yet?
[3:27:14] MalsNotBad: Owned his own death
[3:27:21] yrp01: Who wants the smoke so close to the nesingwary and rebel camp
[3:27:21] Vikinick: oof

[3:28:00] Skinnymctoothpick: Dance the way I'm are Dance
[3:28:04] yrp01: I would love if SoD extended to TBC as well NGL
[3:29:33] Hento: anything pre cata
[3:29:45] casualcarpet: so im trollin a tad but whats the point of a pvp server if nothing happens high or low
[3:29:45] ThatMarkShow: True
[3:30:12] yrp01: I always hated the classic+ idea
[3:30:13] Hento: @casualcarpet what you mean?
[3:30:19] yrp01: in essence isnt TBC just classic+
[3:30:21] czeksmyx: apparently the SoD Void shit is supposed to be Retail storyline history that you never got to see before with Xal'atath
[3:30:35] casualcarpet: but you can kill lows, highs can kill you
[3:30:43] Hento: which is impressive
[3:30:45] casualcarpet: no one does anything
[3:30:55] yrp01: Thats plot armor
[3:31:05] czeksmyx: @casualcarpet he was very, very, very lucky
[3:31:07] Hento: lol this man has not leveled in a classic pvp setting
[3:31:11] yrp01: He was giga lucky
[3:31:13] czeksmyx: him being alive is very rare
[3:31:30] czeksmyx: I've never done it ever
[3:31:31] casualcarpet: fair
[3:31:50] czeksmyx: pure skill is what I meant
[3:31:50] yrp01: STV like 2 weeks ago was a hellscape
[3:31:52] Hento: my paladin getting to silverfang keep I died like 3 times whne I was playing lol
[3:31:55] Ensifus: Gayge me 2 bud
[3:31:56] Hento: but I had to get my uber quest maul
[3:31:59] MalsNotBad: Strangle thorn killing fields was fun to level through
[3:32:16] yrp01: you get some of them consumes in stonetalon
[3:32:29] czeksmyx: I aint gonna lie, I go outta my way to kill night elves regardless of level
[3:32:31] Hento: I will always miss the killing fields of hillsbrad southshore vs terran mill
[3:32:44] Fenriz153: lonewolf?
[3:32:50] czeksmyx: Crusader Strike
[3:32:55] Fenriz153: oof
[3:33:13] czeksmyx: I weirdly won't attack Dwarven Body type 2's
[3:33:13] Hento: huuuge
[3:33:15] yrp01: its literally the streamer server KEKW
[3:33:25] yrp01: ofc he's gonna be on crusader strike
[3:33:32] Hento: I tried to roll on that server when it launched
[3:33:39] Hento: it was a no go lol
[3:33:41] yrp01: yeah there was no way at the start
[3:33:54] Hento: I forgot where me and my friend  ended up
[3:33:55] SirSlyDingo: im shocked you are still streaming when you werent going to stream tonight
[3:33:58] czeksmyx: danse danse danse
[3:34:02] Ensifus: love a bit of no doubt
[3:34:33] SirSlyDingo: for real?
[3:34:39] Ensifus: BREAKDANCECAT
[3:34:56] Hento: he did in fact say that
[3:35:11] SirSlyDingo: my bad
[3:35:20] casualcarpet: im only typing bc i play living flame and its drastically different than this
[3:35:39] Hento: skirt
[3:35:45] yrp01: LauraPls
[3:35:47] UltimateTurtle7: not very blue collar of you
[3:36:18] Hento: yea
[3:36:34] Hento: and sod players might be a bit more carebear then back in the day
[3:36:44] Hento: oof
[3:36:47] yrp01: its also the streamer realm and an RP real so you get a dilute slightly
[3:36:52] czeksmyx: Madge
[3:36:55] MalsNotBad: :3
[3:36:55] Skinnymctoothpick: OwO
[3:36:59] Hento: that would make me go alliance
[3:37:00] ThatMarkShow: Wtf happening on horde side???
[3:37:04] UltimateTurtle7: OwO

[3:37:50] SirSlyDingo: i just watched asmongolds reaction to "blizzard is worse than you thought" video and it reminded me of all the bullshit we put up with over the years.. so much broken promises
[3:37:55] UltimateTurtle7: KEKW
[3:38:13] SirSlyDingo: interesting song
[3:38:20] Hento: phrasing?
[3:38:28] Vikinick: you're the floorboard?
[3:38:36] Fenriz153: oh, cant even make horde on crusader atm LUL
[3:38:56] czeksmyx: I'd be surprised if that didn't happen. He is a self-admitted waffle stomper and ruiner of floorboards
[3:39:07] Fenriz153: it swaps back and forth for balance, but yea
[3:39:15] Hento: they seem to be really trying to keep the balance
[3:39:17] Fenriz153: the whole reason im horde is because alliance was locked
[3:39:33] czeksmyx: L take. Shamsn are the best
[3:39:45] yrp01: when asmon plays its giga locked otherwise its just horde ganking the alliance rest of the time
[3:39:57] Hento: I rolled Alliance just cause  Iwanted to try pally in SOD....
[3:40:06] SirSlyDingo: i dont think asmon plays classic anymore hes busy grinding the genshin impact style mmos
[3:40:06] Hento: but I am a bloodelf boi at heart
[3:40:16] czeksmyx: I heard some DK rune rumors for Paladins
[3:40:23] Fenriz153: water totem quest can go fuck itself though
[3:40:27] czeksmyx: ^^^
[3:40:33] czeksmyx: Call of Water is literal cancer
[3:40:58] Hento: the quest to get the paladin maul, holy fuck that was a time and a half
[3:41:05] czeksmyx: Call of air cracks me up though. They're all "take this totem outta my fuckin hands"
[3:41:22] czeksmyx: quest over
[3:41:40] Hento: its an actual path tho
[3:41:42] Hento: isnt it?
[3:41:46] czeksmyx: yep
[3:42:05] Hento: there are alot of places to go from sunrock
[3:42:14] czeksmyx: I went in from the other side
[3:42:21] czeksmyx: might not be the best or only way though
[3:43:17] Hento: hard stop lol
[3:43:28] czeksmyx: the quests will give you a bunch of xp thankfully, but not compared to what you'd get just grinding
[3:43:28] Hento: it would have been something to do at lvl cap :)
[3:43:29] yrp01: yeah it seems like a sink but its giga good
[3:43:46] yrp01: Na this isnt worth at level cap
[3:43:50] Hento: cause you couldnt get xp anyway
[3:43:57] yrp01: its not about the bag its about the consumes anyways
[3:44:14] yrp01: and no way those consumers will work next phase
[3:44:15] czeksmyx: ye, pointless at level cap unless you're just waitinf for the cap to hit 50
[3:44:56] yrp01: free big bag
[3:45:04] czeksmyx: ye, 12 slotter
[3:45:10] yrp01: sturdy lunchbox is a 12 slot
[3:45:24] yrp01: you just got it
[3:45:36] yrp01: student fodder NODDERS
[3:46:02] czeksmyx: Yeah, it's easy
[3:46:07] yrp01: consume of the things now @Moosebrother they are 30 min CD
[3:46:26] czeksmyx: just blast him with whatever element he's currently vulnerable to
[3:46:42] yrp01: the 100% xp buff will diminish it abit its probz worth using right now
[3:46:46] czeksmyx: I saved mine until level 39
[3:46:58] yrp01: it depends if your gonna rush or not
[3:47:01] czeksmyx: and filled out the whole bar
[3:47:18] czeksmyx: he'll be a swamp elemental looking guy
[3:47:32] yrp01: if your gonna rush you need to pump the gas abit cause otherwise you will run out of 30 min windows
[3:47:45] yrp01: otherwise its best for later
[3:48:33] Hento: god this crater, I have died so many times here lol
[3:48:45] yrp01: yeah charred vale is a hell scape
[3:48:57] czeksmyx: this is where I'm most fucking aggressive. The graveyards in this zone are shit
[3:49:10] czeksmyx: I aint gonna risk letting someone jump me
[3:49:11] Hento: like a cornered animal lol

[4:05:39] zara1024: people being reasonable, good one mbroClassic
