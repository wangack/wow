[0:22:51] MrGattz: you know it still doesnt fix the problem. more loot isnt dropping. there is no vender. you can just upgrade the loot that you happen to get from a m+ if you are lucky.
[0:23:09] MrGattz: they only fixed half the issue
[0:23:45] i_cassius: good for alts tho
[0:23:59] i_cassius: but yeh ..need drops increased
[0:24:14] MrGattz: how so? its no better for alts than it is for your main. they didnt do anything to help alts lol
[0:24:46] i_cassius: upgrading gear
[0:25:19] swampt1l: Valor POG
[0:26:37] MrGattz: i mean.. sure the achievement is account wide. i hope. but you still need to run a million and a half dungeons to get the loot that is bis in the first place to then upgrade it
[0:27:53] Black_Skittlez: good morning all!
[0:28:14] DynamiteZeddy: It'd be nice if they were also adding a vendor, so those people who have run DoS for a trinket 30 times with no drop can use valor to purchase it directly, then upgrade it with more valor if the want.
[0:28:28] MrGattz: yep.

[0:58:13] Netratrix: the real question is, is it account wide?
[0:58:27] UnholyLP: it should be 226, just like pvp
[0:58:35] Zivs: My friend has a couple pieces below 220
[0:58:38] idenkaz_: accountwide yeah KEKW
[0:58:38] Zivs: at KSM
[0:58:40] Srakir: I do. I'm 213 and have keystone master
[0:58:41] idksupz: It definitely should be higher scaling among the tiers
[0:58:41] UnholyLP: because valor is capped like conquest, so why 220 vs 226
[0:58:42] Hyvest: Yeah, cause I suck at pvp. But only like 3-4 slots
[0:58:44] sarcilav: maybe for some trinkets that are on the realm of 207-210
[0:58:48] kazzthekeeper: maybe for trinkets
[0:58:49] terryble_gaming: yeah im all 213 pretty much
[0:58:49] MrGharr: 226 should be available
[0:58:52] Sincline387: it will encourage people to push for that, where as before people might sit at 10s
[0:58:55] kazzthekeeper: or weapons
[0:58:59] BuddySinister: Sounds like another way to catch up with ilvl
[0:58:59] Alexszander: only good for newly dinged lvl 60s who push 15s
[0:59:11] Xistaben: but does GFUEL support the new Valor System?
[0:59:19] sarcilav: maybe a 233 proc chance on the vault?
[0:59:21] idenkaz_: currency and accountwide dont go along vey well in Blizzards book KEKW

[0:59:39] Hellogoodbryan: this lets you target
[0:59:42] Ordicos: is it account wide or character based for alt gearing?
[0:59:54] MrGharr: 226 for 17 and 233 for 20 maybe?
[0:59:56] Sincline387: did people really think they'd get 226 and 233 for free?

[1:00:29] propoopimus: what about if you farm m+ for an item and never get it, ive been doing 15 pf for weapon and never got one
[1:00:39] idenkaz_: weekly capped?
[1:01:15] br0fest0r: 226 should be fine by 9.0.5
[1:01:17] cabalish: towHAMUP good morning
[1:01:22] akia03: and more mats to grind in the maw
[1:01:47] mobbo: I don’t see a need for M+ to allow 226 or 233... maybe if you do all 20s your vault has a chance at 233 weapons... just one mans opinion
[1:01:55] MrGharr: by the time 9.0.5 rolls, no competitive player will need 220 on their mains.
[1:02:01] at1c: How would a M+ player get 233 gear?
[1:02:13] mo197: don't anger the pvp or raid community is the goal while still satisfying the casuals
[1:02:37] 3v3r35t_: +20s get a weapon
[1:02:42] Kebabra_: @towelliee I think 220 is fine for dungeons, that'll get you in to heroic raids. It feels right that the best gear comes from mythic raiding in terms of pve
[1:02:43] sarcilav: maybe getting 20s will give you some type of currency, that will let you upgrade some slot to 233
[1:02:48] sorli_: ten 20+ keys
[1:02:49] sarcilav: maybe trinkets?
[1:02:51] sorli_: for 233
[1:03:01] Tauree25: @Towelliee or just make it cost ALOT and timegate it after 3-4 weeks
[1:03:09] WHKJNeferPitou: 233 should only be available for the people who finished the content of the tier, and should not be helpful during progression
[1:03:23] KingSlayerYotam: not enough people doing anything above 15 anyway
[1:03:29] eziz86: Any job get buff dps ?

[1:04:12] Hellogoodbryan: 1400
[1:04:17] mo197: on't anger the pvp or raid community is the goal while still satisfying the casuals

[1:04:19] casualboomer: 14-16-18-21
[1:04:28] casualboomer: 220 is 1800
[1:04:31] Dagomarus: My ceiling is 213 and this isnt helping since i dont know anyone who can do 15+
[1:04:33] casualboomer: KSM is WAY harder than 1800 in RBGs
[1:04:36] Tears_0f_sin: 213 is 1600
[1:04:37] KumaEnjoyer: 220ilvl is a joke, +15 is too easy to earn 226ilvl, +21 and higher should give 233 in the vault imo
[1:04:53] miroc228: i think it should be 223

[1:05:06] Crowzcut: no chance
[1:05:06] zaraine1: probably some pieces
[1:05:07] UnholyLP: they should increase the difficulty for +15 in 9.1 so it matches 226 like pvp and doing higher than +15 there should be a chance for 233 from the vault
[1:05:13] Kromede: never
[1:05:17] at1c: Nope
[1:05:21] 1godofwar0: points or badges?

[1:05:33] pavepawns: boosters are rolling in cash
[1:05:45] sarcilav: not a chance, but it will give a progress path, you will aim for the 10s and upgrade to 213 and with 213 they can try to push for the 15s

[1:06:48] Bixster: i think its good. its for m+ players that cant anything above 210 outside of the weekly chest.
[1:06:54] Talason: they should make pvp gear harder to get
[1:06:56] Sincline387: they do with honor
[1:07:00] rilsolo: vallr will be converted to gold like conquest simple
[1:07:01] Crowzcut: yes its ok i feel the casuals still thinking i cant do that
[1:07:09] Tears_0f_sin: i think pvp and m+ should be on the same level of gear which should be above heroic raiding but lower than mythic raiding
[1:07:09] mo197: bad players who get carried are just bad players with gear
[1:07:10] Sincline387: no they will zero the value
[1:07:11] Zivs: I think they will reset it to 0 yeah
[1:07:12] rilsolo: valor*
[1:07:17] MrGharr: but valor has a weekly cap.
[1:07:20] zaraine1: i mean if you are doing 15s you already doing all hc or some mythic raid
[1:07:24] HotHotHeals: Ksm should be higher than 220. Getting 1800 arena rating is miles easier than running 15s

[1:08:00] sorli_: YEP WHY

[1:08:27] Korupcija_: 226 gear from world content Pog
[1:08:29] GazXIII: It's clear this is the first iteration, hopefully the y will improve. I'm, ok with 220 cap, drop rates are more conerning. Can't upgrrade gear that doesnt drop
[1:09:02] alex12645: like there mythic key gears that is better then raid gear
[1:09:14] SirDoder: and get people back in dungeons. there's no point in doing them currently
[1:09:25] GazXIII: Yep. As the expansion goes on, secondary stats will become more valued and 220 pieces will be better than some 226
[1:09:32] Antdavs24: after WF they should have free range to make adjustments
[1:09:49] shadeofdark: That means you can get 213 on all pieces and then, the next step you need to complete KSM. BUT, is it possible for a casual with ~215 ilvl complete KSM ???
[1:10:04] akia03: how would they do m+ gear when they bring tier sets back into raids?
[1:10:09] KingSlayerYotam: @Towelliee the people these changes are for already stopped playing tbh
[1:10:09] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:10:15] WundertueteGER: !
[1:10:19] Athaeln: That would make too much sense so they wont do it
[1:10:20] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[1:10:33] Stolhanske: There is no difference to buff the loot, like they did when they nerfed the time walking raid.
[1:10:34] Clicklesly: Didn't they same they might do covenant transfers if the changes would be really huge?
[1:10:38] MrGharr: @shadeofdark yes, but also count in weekly vault upgrades.
[1:10:51] doomkry: @roscodashx will be good for alts
[1:10:56] Tigerklaue: they will just increase raid loot again
[1:11:05] casualboomer: I guess this beats a sharp stick in the eye
[1:11:11] Tears_0f_sin: am i the only person with KSM at 215 ilvl, i think m+ should give the same as pvp but i'm just glad i can finally upgrade with m+
[1:11:11] GazXIII: It's clear that this is to "test the waters" for next patch. Obviously 220 gear is largely irrelevant at this stage, but its a step in the right direction
[1:11:12] zaraine1: @Towelliee how do you upgrade gear that doesnt drop ? LUL
[1:11:24] Srakir: Will this allow for upgrades on my alts? Or do you need KSM on all characters?
[1:11:39] doomkry: ksm achiev is account wide i think
[1:11:43] shadeofdark: @Helyiolasz I hope. I`m just one of those players, who hope till the end of season 1 to get KSM :D
[1:11:46] mo197: KSM is account wide?

[1:11:51] Korupcija_: is valor going to be capped like conquest for pvp?
[1:11:54] casualboomer: KSM will have to be per character
[1:11:55] GazXIII: I hope KSM is account wide, but I doubt it will be for upgrading
[1:11:59] Kebabra_: You should pick a permanent covenantto do dailes, mission tables etc. then the other 3 covenant abilities should be a level 60 talent you can switch between like a normal talent
[1:12:05] Thdlock: some unknown thing sin the maw
[1:12:06] Zivs: legendary tuning was mentioned
[1:12:16] Thunderbrew: When will the patch be released?
[1:12:17] casualboomer: KSM may be an achievement account wide, but PVP gear is NOT upgradable across toons if you don't have the achievement on the specific toon
[1:12:30] Hellogoodbryan: i don't think it should be account wide.. pvp isn't
[1:12:37] Thunderbrew: What is KSM?
[1:12:43] Hellogoodbryan: that would put it miles above every other gearing option
[1:12:46] byrdeen45: last 3 weeks clearing heroic raids and not one piece of gear
[1:12:47] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: keystonemaster
[1:12:50] casualboomer: PvP players will lose their minds if KSM gearing is account wide. Because gladiator on one toon doesn't let you go straight to 233 weps on another
[1:12:51] sarcilav: uhhh that is huge for alts then
[1:12:52] Tears_0f_sin: keystone master achievement @Thunderbrew
[1:12:57] GazXIII: I don't think it will be. PVP upgrades don't work like that, I don't think they give it account wide
[1:13:02] Korupcija_: but is valor capped?
[1:13:08] GazXIII: Valor is capped, yes
[1:13:12] casualboomer: But there's NO GEAR attached to it being account wide
[1:13:21] casualboomer: as it stands right now
[1:13:21] Dismah: Yo, I haven't played retail WoW since the middle of Legion. Is it worth coming back in now?
[1:13:42] casualboomer: You can take a hpal to glad in 3s, but that doesn't mean you can take your rogue straight to 226 gear without going through the ladder
[1:13:42] Hellogoodbryan: you didn't do the content on that toon.. why should you get the gear?
[1:13:43] redfernn: !valor
[1:13:44] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[1:13:57] swampt1l: Can you test it on PTR?
[1:14:05] GazXIII: PVPers be living like kings this xpac
[1:14:07] casualboomer: LUL I got ten upgrades yesterday for hitting 1800 in RBGs towelliee. I don't care about what they do for M+ LUL
[1:14:14] Tigerklaue: im happy about fhe fleshcraft buff
[1:14:22] Sincline387: if PVP players get random gear off the vendor then sure they can lose their mind
[1:14:34] Crowzcut: pvp players are so toxic sometimes
[1:14:36] MILESkg21: imagine being an RBG farmer LUL
[1:14:36] Thdlock: the best part of valor is mostly just m+ trinekts high ilvl if it stays at 220
[1:14:39] Talason: meaganHmm
[1:14:48] N3_Destro: Warlock nerf makes destro pretty much equal to Affy
[1:14:53] casualboomer: @CrowzCut the ENTIRE community has toxic people BrokeBack don't pretend it's just pvp
[1:14:55] saintsinning: saintsinning subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months!

[1:15:18] Netratrix: huge
[1:15:19] N3_Destro: quantum sucks in raids lol
[1:15:20] sarcilav: I've not seen (in even from heroic) my first Blood-Spattered Scale on any of my tanks
[1:15:23] Aggravius: double
[1:15:27] cowee12356995: fleshcraft is awesome now
[1:15:28] casualboomer: I put 8 weeks into M+ and hit hard walls on gear. I spent 10 days in PvP on two toons, and raised their equipped ilvls by 3-5 in less than two weeks
[1:15:29] UnholyLP: 40% and you dont need mobs anymore
[1:15:37] Thdlock: fleshcraft has a 30% dr 3 sec channel instead of 4 and the hsield is 40% instead of 20% and it has passive cdr when u walk over corpses by 1 sec
[1:15:48] DeanoTV: still doesn't help the 0 loot
[1:16:10] N3_Destro: @Towelliee they need to address locks Shadow embrace and loot in mythic still lol
[1:16:28] Talason: did they buff dh tanks
[1:16:32] swampt1l: Did they touch MM in 9.0.5?
[1:16:46] N3_Destro: @Talason they buffed dh tanks and dps
[1:16:53] N3_Destro: increased dmg on some abilities
[1:16:56] swampt1l: Or just covenant buffs?
[1:17:18] N3_Destro: and took away a miss the ability that takes health if you miss
[1:17:37] DoozerDan: Survival huntards still not touched
[1:17:54] Apokolipz: did someone say glazed donuts?
[1:17:59] sarcilav: not bad
[1:18:15] KingSlayerYotam: nerfing kyrian vdh oof
[1:18:40] Tensei_c: are you aware that this scene is worse than the normal (gameplay) fullscreen scene? so much wasted space
[1:18:50] Tigerklaue: finally some dh nerfs
[1:18:50] MOLAR305: that's a nerf in m+ but a buff I in mythic raiding

[1:25:13] Ribbwich: @Towelliee it was a typo
[1:25:15] Korupcija_: affliction is such a bad spec in current meta
[1:25:16] N3_Destro: they took away affy's burst really
[1:25:24] luckfore: im sad there are no changes to raid gear, why dont they just up it while they work on adding a vendor or something
[1:25:26] Thdlock: nah they didnt take affys brust
[1:25:30] Thdlock: they killed the spec

[1:48:19] casualboomer: Honestly, if they're going to monkey with covenants, they should have one consequence-free swap where you don't have to redo renown
[1:48:38] idksupz: Blizzard really said "mEaNiNgFuL"
[1:48:38] casualboomer: So if you're Renown 30 Kyrian and they nerfed your shit, then you can swap to Necrolord at Renown 30
[1:48:39] idksupz: LMFAO
[1:48:46] Jyckle: past renown 30 just make it instant swap no quests

[2:02:38] Reckless_Monk: man alt gearing will be even more easier
[2:02:46] DehCantao: So blizzard is saying people should get KSM with 213 ish ilvl (plus the 226s from vault)

[2:04:14] falsenx: @cenobytes does it look like it lol
[2:04:18] mulletrocker11358: now.. when u get ksm.. does that let ur alts get the higher loot to upgrde to?
[2:04:18] PzychOSC2: im fine with all +18s for 226
[2:04:19] jedrad: definitely doable
[2:04:22] Todmeister9000: trailer KEKW
[2:04:23] MOLAR305: if Valor is account wide ksm can help alts
[2:04:23] mizuryo: most non mythic pugs have 213ish ilvl and KSM
[2:04:29] x614x_engineer: is KSM all 15s or 10s?

[2:04:44] Darthyrevan: this week is easy
[2:04:50] pemadsen17: will the pugs invite people to a +15 with a 213 ilevel is the question.
[2:04:51] datNovazGG: @x614x_engineer is 15s
[2:04:58] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: cant even do ksm cause ppl wont take me. i tried 2 hours yesterday to get into a 15
[2:05:01] mo197: your alts
[2:05:16] datNovazGG: @pemadsen17 you're talking about PUGs.. that's a different world :D
[2:05:26] Reckless_Monk: KSM w/ pugs is harr
[2:05:26] Hellogoodbryan: there is no way it is account wide
[2:05:26] Affiiance: Oh wait? I can get valor on my alts?
[2:05:50] Reckless_Monk: do m+0 s and upgrade to 220 lol
[2:05:55] Reckless_Monk: ezclap
[2:05:59] jedrad: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect use your own key and boost it up! then you can pick and choose who you want
[2:05:59] pavepawns: if they arent accountwide its gonna be an alt issue too imo
[2:06:02] datNovazGG: Will M0s give valor? :O

[2:06:59] xxKrayzie: if they dont do it account im ddone with wow^^
[2:07:01] datNovazGG: How does PVP rating work? do you need to do that on an alt or can you upgrade to 226 if you only have the needed rating on your main?
[2:07:04] Fensmarken: Surely they will change it so that the character needs to complete KSM just like it needs the rating. Unless thats the reasoning for the 220 cap and in that case - fuck that
[2:07:04] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect not a good tip. i wont play my own..it got depleted way too much by leavers

[2:13:02] k_randals: @towelliee Do you think they will do anything more with the Runecarver? Seems like you go to him for ur main item then forget him.
[2:13:03] byrdeen45: sorry caps
[2:13:04] Beladrix_: They honestly need to bring back badges
[2:13:05] ThisTHC: Could you imagine if shadowlands launched without not loot issues? man this would be a pretty good xpac!
[2:13:06] DeanoTV: all they need to do is make 1 more piece of loot drop in dungeons and raids ez
[2:13:10] ThisTHC: no
[2:13:19] propoopimus: gimme a fkn bonus roll per week with a guaranteed item and im happy
[2:13:24] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[2:13:25] Aro725: bonus rolls coming in hot, get ready to b roll some 35 anima LUL
[2:13:26] craigb_: towPog
[2:13:28] eakiller: give raiders a vendor with sludgefist heads as currency
[2:13:29] Brickneim: my druid wants a 226 bell for convoke
[2:13:29] odysseus1: dansGame
[2:13:37] foobis_25: 226 instrucors divine bell :O
[2:13:47] MrGattz: i dont honestly even know why they removed bonus rolls.
[2:13:49] Zettabyte: @MrGattz, @Towelliee , do we even have an international caps (like CAPS) day? towLul
[2:13:58] Antdavs24: just give me bonus roll so i can get 35 more anima Kappa
[2:14:00] MOLAR305: guarantee it at lower ilvl lol
[2:14:08] MrGattz: @Zettabyte nah we dont but moobot would have a field day with that lol
[2:14:13] Aro725: you druids dont need a 226 bell you just need a necro warrior for 500 mastery LUL
[2:14:15] datNovazGG: Loot should never be guaranteed.. it will be boring.. I'm telling you
[2:14:15] gtmax69: how do you get valor?
[2:14:15] Zettabyte: hahaha xD
[2:14:34] Mecabeast: 226 fonders
[2:14:50] MrGattz: i dont want guaranteed loot. i just want more loot. it doesnt even have to be for my current class or spec. just more loot.
[2:15:10] DeanoTV: all they need to do is make 1 more piece of loot drop in dungeons and raids ez.
[2:15:10] MrWhey2Fast: We should get 1 BONUS ROLL a week and that bonus roll is a 100% guaranteed piece of loot when used.
[2:15:16] MrGattz: maybe sometimes its account bound and you can trade it with your alts
[2:15:22] MrGattz: get your alts geared up
[2:15:24] propoopimus: you were basically guaranteed an item if you cleared a raid each week in past xpacs, you can go an entire month this season and get jack shit
[2:15:29] GazXIII: Im on the fenc with 220 loot. I don't think M+ should reward 226 loot. But I don't see how this change helps if the loot doesn't drop in the first place
[2:15:55] skruffie_: skruffie_ subscribed with Prime. 
[2:16:09] josh8555: well that's cool they are adding valor
[2:16:20] Antdavs24: at least we a bonus roll i can at least try for loot that i need on a specific boss, the raid weekly vault just adds to more RNG
[2:16:32] Mecabeast: what if we saw benthic return?
[2:16:35] foobis_25: the other side of that is pvp you can get 226 from 3 RBGs
[2:16:42] pavepawns: i feel like an 18+ should give u 226 as its what higher players are used since MDI
[2:16:44] DoozerDan: Its fiiiine its gonna take scrubs like mee alon time tp complete 10*15
[2:16:45] Lanthor: There needs to be something above +15s, 233 upgradable for all 20s or something, 226 upgradable from 18s
[2:16:52] Lanthor: 233 weapons I mean
[2:17:02] Solid0Liquid: I wish they would just make it to where your effort/time was rewarded. Feels bad to play all evening and get only anima or shit you don't need
[2:17:08] aizensouzukee: croysmonk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[2:17:12] Spaede: Heck no m+ shouldn’t give mythic raid level gear. Tons of scrubs get KSM, way less people get CE
[2:17:12] Brickneim: maybe just let weapons upgrade to 233 like pvp
[2:17:19] GazXIII: This wouldnt be a problem if pvp gear didn't reward 226 and 233. It's the disparity between PVE and PVP looters that's the problem imo
[2:17:48] pavepawns: 233 would be a +20
[2:17:58] Aro725: shit itd have to be 20 plus at least
[2:18:09] byrdeen45: but if you hate mythic + its going to suck
[2:18:15] Aro725: less tha 1 percent of pvpers are 2400
[2:18:22] Aro725: and how many ppl kill mythic sire?
[2:18:22] GazXIII: Yea 233 should be 20+ at least
[2:18:24] Lanthor: I feel like 233 weapon for all 20s in time is reasonable
[2:18:29] Thunder4o: M+ players shouldnt be able to get 226 or 233,they dont do hard enough content to deserve this,Weekly voult is enough 226 for them
[2:18:32] CrunkyBrewster: Read the Valor update. Yeah um I dont mythic+ so it doesnt mean anything to me
[2:18:42] Solid0Liquid: @GazXIII yeah espescially since when you are forced to do content that you don't want to do it feels less enjoyable while getting the loot
[2:18:42] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[2:18:46] Fensmarken: @Aro725 where do you pull that statistic from?
[2:18:47] DehCantao: @Towelliee you are right, the problem is this is taking into account only m+. But when you stop to think that pvpers and mythic raiders get way more 226 and 233 items than the vault gives you it loses the appeal
[2:18:48] byrdeen45: exchange for items you get
[2:18:50] MrGattz: @byrdeen45 if you hate m+ though then blizzard needs to look at why people hate m+. because no one that enjoys pve content should hate m+
[2:18:54] KingSlayerYotam: make the same system as pvp have
[2:19:03] KingSlayerYotam: base gear with valor upgrade
[2:19:04] PoppaShot: they give ppl better loot then ppl complain its not easy enought KEKW @Towelliee
[2:19:16] cozyzequel: explain the valor, just got home from work
[2:19:26] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I think blizz still forgot the most important thing. The Flight Whistle
[2:19:27] MrGattz: !valor
[2:19:27] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[2:19:40] MrGattz: @PadidinJones truth
[2:20:25] Affiiance: Yeah that sounds good
[2:20:25] dcorey416: if loot actually dropped there would be no vendor
[2:20:43] Affiiance: +20 Timed seems closer to Mythic Raiding
[2:20:43] Lanthor: Absolutely
[2:20:49] GazXIII: I wouldn't mind M+ giving 223 loot, and having a vendor to buy the item. If you buy the item it's expensive and takes a while to get that currency. You can farm the dungeon for the piece + aquire loot in that time
[2:20:52] propoopimus: that is what he means, you are buying it through valor
[2:20:57] jerexify: @Towelliee Yeah, they nerfed that respawn area.
[2:21:00] Thunder4o: 20 were already super easy,they are not high enough for 233,most of the people doesnt have 233 from raids nor PvP,M+ shouldnt ever reward highest ilvl
[2:21:12] foobis_25: Maybe somewhere between 15 and 20, but in 15s someones always getting carried
[2:21:16] luckfore: imagine if they also added vendor where you can buy gear with tokens, that wouldve been sick
[2:21:30] GazXIII: Of course they nerfed the respawn area. Because clicking souls in the maw was such rewarding content, lets make it harder
[2:21:30] propoopimus: 20s are not super easy...
[2:21:40] Buckwink: yeah wtf is up with that
[2:21:41] Thunder4o: they are
[2:21:55] GazXIII: Not to mention have fun on alts trying to catch up on renown with this change...
[2:22:14] MrGattz: i dare you to pug a +20 and call it easy @Thunder4o lol
[2:22:22] Amarlian: I am keeping up purely for flying
[2:22:22] Buckwink: they cast Jared Leto as the joker again FeelsBadMan
[2:22:28] Thunder4o: @MrGattz i did
[2:22:34] GazXIII: If you think 20+ is easy you are either 1) Delusional, 2) Should be playing in MDI
[2:22:35] Fensmarken: @Thunder4o why does it matter where it comes from as long as its the top end of that content? PvP got 233 weapons, so they wouldnt be forced to raid - Why should m+ be different?
[2:22:41] Riggoz1: I'd really like to see how many people in chat actually have a +20 timed LUL
[2:22:44] BladeOne_: isnt there 1 more upgrade to WQ loot ?
[2:22:46] MrGattz: @GazXIII pretty much
[2:22:54] Lordcookkiie: !addons
[2:22:54] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Check !Discord's pinned messages in the #cesspool channel for further installation details. Dont forget to make backups!
[2:22:54] datNovazGG: @MrGattz in all fairness you shouldn't compare a 20+ PUG with a mythic raiding guild.. that's not fair :)
[2:22:55] jerseyfive: give more anima i cant upgrade s#it in my covenant
[2:23:00] Thunder4o: @Fensmarken because M+ is not same skill level as Raids and PvP
[2:23:10] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[2:23:15] Rictamar: I don't even have a 10 timed, true casual :)
[2:23:36] PadidinJones: Raider IO Hosting
[2:23:39] GazXIII: Lets be real here. A 20+ key is more difficult than the first 3-4 bosses of a mythic raid.
[2:23:52] luckfore: he revealed the thing, you can tell us what it is :)
[2:23:55] MrGattz: @datNovazGG no. your 100% correct. but 5% of the entire player base or less is in a mythic raiding guild doing +20s for fun. we arint talking about that % of players in the big picture
[2:24:19] shimwood: There are some up top
[2:24:19] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[2:24:20] Fensmarken: @Thunder4o That's just an opinion - but even if we honor it - why does that fucking matter? You need a 233 weapon to push the highest key possible yea?
[2:24:25] Amarlian: that sucks if they nerfed it, it's not like it's a compelling quest to collect souls @Towelliee . plus next week it's more
[2:24:31] PadidinJones: @Towelliee he said something about Raider IO hosting him for mythics I think
[2:24:37] GermanBacon: pepeMeltdown 2 more
[2:24:42] datNovazGG: @MrGattz That's true.. :)

[2:25:10] 3663Sharad: DONE ... Dead LUL
[2:25:21] WadyCesar: Abduction incoming
[2:25:31] Thunder4o: @Fensmarken none care about keys after 15,not blizzard atleast,only some random third party web site that put some random score next to your char that reset every season
[2:26:02] datNovazGG: Honestly I'm happy for the valor system in 9.0.5.. I still have 197 / 200 pieces because I don't like doing PVP.. To me it's better than the current system.. even if I can only upgrade them to 213 (until I eventually get KSM)
[2:26:31] Buckwink: that happened to Lirik and he had like 100k for weeks
[2:26:33] PadidinJones: Thats really awesome for him @Towelliee Hes getting places yo
[2:26:46] UnholyLP: thunder4o there are official leaderboards for arena, m+ and mythic raiding, what are you talking about
[2:26:52] beatdown91: @Towelliee where can we see your addons?
[2:26:55] CrunkyBrewster: im stuck at 171
[2:26:56] xxKrayzie: if you have no sskill you never reach it!

[2:27:01] datNovazGG: I'm not 200 iLvl.. but I have 200 pieces.. I'm doing 12s+ every week
[2:27:13] jure__: I think +10s is still doable with pugs, higher you will have problems
[2:27:15] Thunderpint: Agreed
[2:27:19] GazXIII: This change is great for more casual players who Heroic raid and do +10-12
[2:27:32] KingSlayerYotam: heroic should always be the spot for casuals, it feels the best in open world
[2:27:37] flyingmachin3: did anyone respond to you account wide ksm question?
[2:27:40] George2001k: 205 ilvl is where you can get stuck if you don’t do heroic raids
[2:27:43] woody879: as a casual 213 was the goal i set at the start
[2:27:45] GermanBacon: 2.5 mil
[2:27:49] xxKrayzie: gatiung itmlvl behind skill is BS
[2:27:54] Ponickz: !valor
[2:27:55] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[2:28:01] Affiiance: Lol
[2:28:04] Buckwink: lfr should give valor too so us better players have a reason to join
[2:28:08] GazXIII: Right now Im 221 because Im using 207 trinkets with 226 in all other spots but cloak because drops
[2:28:13] Rictamar: 212 here, 9/10 H basically farming it, 7% on Sire for my guild
[2:28:15] Fensmarken: @Thunder4o Theres plenty of people who care about it. Plenty of people who enjoy pushing keys as their content.
[2:28:19] Affiiance: Yeah ilvl gated behind skill? What is this madness
[2:28:20] Thunder4o: @UnholyLP there is nothing for M+ ...only ranking system ingame is for PvP and raids
[2:28:23] foxies_havocing: @George2001k I didn't do a single hc boss and I am 218 ilvl
[2:28:36] donpablo_98: i jst hit 205 but i dnt get on as much i jst hop on to rank up my renown and get do a mythic for a chest
[2:28:40] GazXIII: Yep, if the valor costs are stupidly high this is a waste of time
[2:28:42] MOLAR305: 2 weeks for 1 item upgrade lol
[2:28:44] LordJeffers: i assume it'll be like conquest upgrade
[2:28:49] CrunkyBrewster: yeah no thanks lol
[2:28:50] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what ilvl loot have you been getting from your calling sacks? Mine have been 200+ Been really nice
[2:28:51] MisterD1rty: When is valor coming into effect?
[2:29:03] CrunkyBrewster: 9.05
[2:29:08] 3663Sharad: I hope they will implement the MoP Buff: Maxed out Points on your Main, increased gain of VP on all alts
[2:29:13] shimwood: I just hope we can upgrade currently equipped gear as opposed to having to farm gear after the patch.
[2:29:14] Narkissoss: 9.0.5 in March
[2:29:17] datNovazGG: @MisterD1rty when 9.0.5 releases :) probably sometime in March
[2:29:17] Secondbreakfasttt: it could be like corruption token thing forget the name of it
[2:29:48] UnholyLP: where is that raiding ranking system in game? @Thunder4o
[2:29:50] Rictamar: +10 timed in every dungeon is really difficult to pug imo
[2:29:53] Riggoz1: cata valour you could buy the BIS gear right?
[2:29:54] KumaEnjoyer: i still cant get over the fact they are planning on making it 220ilvl, truly a joke
[2:29:56] CrunkyBrewster: the previous Valor was just do the content, get valor, upgrade when you have enough points
[2:30:04] GazXIII: Removing the requirement is fine, just means if you can a 200 piece of loot it costs more valour to upgrade than a 210 to 220
[2:30:10] WhiteKnight74648: They could make it something rediculous like 3 weeks to fully upgrade something and i be happy.
[2:30:12] HellzBellzItzKelz: so it's not a Valor vendor? only upgrades?
[2:30:18] xxKrayzie: ofc and thats gona hapen
[2:30:19] CrunkyBrewster: like Wrath Valor and Justice was simply do Heroics get loot
[2:30:19] Rictamar: might as well just heroic raid, and upgrade your missing slots to 207 and call it a day
[2:30:22] WhiteKnight74648: just take out the requirements
[2:30:35] Antdavs24: i'll stick to raiding
[2:30:43] Sniper_Penguin: DOS is basically impossible with pugs, it’s ridiculous
[2:30:58] GermanBacon: we need them to push the token prices up kinamaHmm
[2:31:01] raldrik: They need to make tanks more powerful and more specs of them viable. It will make it easier to get groups and do keys
[2:31:01] Korupcija_: I don't want them :)
[2:31:01] datNovazGG: If you do 9s you get 216 from weekly.. and you can upgrade the missing pieces to 207.. if you can't get 10s done with that, you're probably not that good :) Even as a casual

[2:32:23] Masqerader: if only they buffed loot to add god forbid +1 piece for timing like previous expansions lol
[2:32:26] mo197: Narcissistic
[2:32:27] CrunkyBrewster: @nicknacking5 same boat my friend
[2:32:31] tulsaboom: Just read whats comming And who targets that, the casuals have left SL already and might not come back
[2:32:32] SlayerLightStorm: Is 190 ilvl good enough to go for Normal raids at this point?
[2:32:48] WastedWookiee: @nicknacking5 Same
[2:32:51] MisterD1rty: Valor system is needed IMO. I clear heroic raid weekly and do 10 plus m+ of 12’s, 13’s, and 14’s. for the past 3 weeks and only get gear from vault
[2:32:59] alextheory_: @SlayerLightStorm we started doing normal with 170 so yes 190 should be enough
[2:33:01] Artivicii: ResidentSleeper rowHAMUP
[2:33:10] flyingmachin3: but its like you said

[2:33:39] flyingmachin3: towUnforch
[2:33:48] Antdavs24: lol kinda fucks the casuals too in a way because if theyre not doing high keys whats the point
[2:33:50] Affiiance: Hell yeah nice
[2:33:51] Masqerader: oh spiteful/storming.. im melee... no +10 /decline
[2:33:55] datNovazGG: Ppl make it sound like casuals just want loot given to them.. if they want everything given to them, they're not good for the game anyway.. :p
[2:33:58] Byytet: Ahh fuck I got a survival hunter, how am I gonna tell him - Towelliee LUL
[2:34:00] redtemplar88: I'm working on 10s now as a casual. I like having to put in real work for my ilvl.
[2:34:07] nicknacking5: yea man im all pvp gear 197 and my leg item
[2:34:10] SlayerLightStorm: @ADMTLgg Cool. Hmu if you need a ranged dps.
[2:34:24] schizowillie: Valhiem is pretty cool just gets boring fast 3 or 4 hours is good on that game
[2:34:26] UnholyLP: LUL nice ingame ranking @Thunder4o
[2:34:27] 3663Sharad: Hey folks: Do you think SD, ToP and PF are doable in 15+ this week? Last three left for KSM, just curious :D
[2:34:27] CrunkyBrewster: i dont think its that they want loot given to them. they just want more ways to obtain loot and not have it feel like they did the content and get nothing from it at all
[2:34:28] Diezel_XL: There is a sizable portion of the player base who hate M+ and raider io
[2:34:28] xxKrayzie: lol
[2:34:36] Mecabeast: there should be seperate achievements from doing a key and timing a key
[2:34:39] hoodlife73: theres only 8 dungos i have to do 10 for acheave wtf
[2:34:41] excessior: casuals can just wait for catchup gear
[2:34:47] mo197: funny how wow is full of haves and have nots
[2:34:59] nicknacking5: no we work and don't have time 4 hour raids
[2:35:10] Amarlian: I thought the issue was running a bunch of mythics only for the hope of gear in a weekly vault is not a great time @Towelliee
[2:35:17] toogoo: @excessior when does catchup gear come out
[2:35:17] Amarlian: does this help that issue
[2:35:22] CrunkyBrewster: no not wrong at all
[2:35:25] craigb_: I don't want loot given to me I don't play endgame content I shouldn't have endgame gear rooSip
[2:35:28] xxKrayzie: special snoflakes! i deresve gear casuals not^^
[2:35:33] Masqerader: @Towelliee It's another we told them so moment.
[2:35:39] azzurrin: Blizzard did this to them self, you can't just change your philsophy you've been using since like Cata
[2:35:40] gangstafred: toweliee gets it
[2:35:41] idenkaz_: my time is limited. i dont have time for that shit KEKW
[2:35:42] CrunkyBrewster: up until now, its been fairly easy for us. All the way back in Wrath til now
[2:35:51] datNovazGG: I still firmly believe that if you play 1-2 nights a week, you can get pretty far in this game iLvl wise.. If that's not casual friendly I dunno what is.. :p
[2:35:52] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[2:35:52] Solid0Liquid: it's not that casual players want gear handed to them, they just have limited time to play and don't feel rewarded for the time they put in.
[2:36:00] azzurrin: It's too late to upend the system
[2:36:01] MOLAR305: i miss visions for quick and easy loot
[2:36:04] Antdavs24: cant blame them given how the past was handled
[2:36:06] Tupaii: Lol that train of thought is fucked up
[2:36:07] mo197: mirrors the real world
[2:36:09] rottisxd: why are you saying its casual issue, alts are there and now the only way to gear them in to spam RBG
[2:36:14] excessior: catchup comes with new season
[2:36:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:36:23] KingSlayerYotam: in bfa we had options like visions for gear for casuals who don't raid and m+
[2:36:24] Geeyouknit2: I’m casual but I like the challenge. I also do feel that pushing keys all week to have to flip a coin blows balls
[2:36:29] Demanisraar: true LUL
[2:36:29] Buckwink: idk if you guys understand how hard casuals have been crying on the forums about loot
[2:36:33] GazXIII: M+ drops more anima now
[2:36:36] Sandisy: they want catchup? increase loot drops from m+. as it is now you can't gear up if nothing drops
[2:36:36] craigb_: loot be loot till it effects $$$ <_<
[2:36:41] RamboSquirrel: The main problem ive seen (as a semi casual) is the whole rating systems coming in. As previously you could do some mythics but now its the whole job experience before you get the job
[2:36:46] CrunkyBrewster: eh its always been a "blame the casuals" argument. I remember people bitching about Valor and Justice back in wrath. TB hated on it so much back then
[2:36:49] Affiiance: I do miss the old World Quest system
[2:36:49] 3663Sharad: Its not only a casual thing imo. Altholics suffer too i think
[2:36:52] idenkaz_: crying, its complaining about a shitty gear system.
[2:36:53] Zarinna2015: @Towelliee I just had a horrible experince in LFR don't go bro
[2:37:05] mizuryo: noway they do that monkaS
[2:37:13] Rictamar: yeh its definitely account wide
[2:37:13] Buckwink: its like they didnt learn from essences and alts
[2:37:14] nicknacking5: so my content is beg a group to take me on a myth plus run with my shitty rating ?
[2:37:18] onionenjoyer_flo: I ain't doing that on all my alts lol
[2:37:24] 3663Sharad: Survival KEK
[2:37:25] Geeyouknit2: Yeah noooowat
[2:37:30] CrunkyBrewster: the best time to do LFR is Tuesday Resets.
[2:37:31] Jixor: you dont have to? the achievement is account wide
[2:37:39] Buckwink: if its accoutn wide it makes alts so much more fun
[2:37:42] GazXIII: I don't even know anymore. Blizzard do Blizzard things
[2:37:46] Aro725: we said that about essances too LUL
[2:37:50] Tessiuz: thats how it is for pvp
[2:37:51] idenkaz_: jup
[2:37:51] rottisxd: pvp rating is the same thing
[2:37:54] xRykku: It was also just annouced. We still have a month before 9.0.5 comes out. It could change with feedback on the ptr. At least they listened and we are getting something rather than continuing with the shit drops we have now..
[2:37:55] Masqerader: @Towelliee It's another we told them so moment and it falls on deaf ears.
[2:37:55] Tessiuz: get it on each char
[2:37:57] Rictamar: doing 10+ timed in every dungeon is a massive ask for most people to be able to get 207 gear
[2:38:03] Solid0Liquid: yeah, none of this affects people who are already geared wether it's from raiding or pvp. They already have the means to upgrade their loot
[2:38:05] flyingmachin3: then pvpers will complain
[2:38:12] idenkaz_: htey tested us with essences they know they could pull this shit off
[2:38:18] bennythejet_ne: Does ksm end in a month too?
[2:38:19] Rictamar: like its not worth it when you can raid...it would take less time
[2:38:19] mansohi: get of your high horse towel
[2:38:28] northcub: if a hunter wants to play melee they should role a warrior
[2:38:39] Tessiuz: why cant we have the same shit?
[2:38:43] Tessiuz: its the same game
[2:38:45] Hellogoodbryan: i just don't get blizzards incentive for account wide
[2:38:45] Masqerader: oh no poor pvpers with their free loot which they can just bis stats lol
[2:38:46] pavepawns: but i dont chill
[2:38:47] pavepawns: i shill
[2:38:50] Korupcija_: eat the PvE-ers 😡
[2:38:52] MuttonChopins: PvPers are complaining with the change?
[2:38:59] Hellogoodbryan: unless its gated by valor being a tough grind
[2:39:03] Fensmarken: @Towelliee I dont agree with that take though. PvP-rating isn't account-wide either. This is not a catch-up system - its a gearing system - Its your progression path for your character... unless it caps at 220 then its catch up to me
[2:39:09] CrunkyBrewster: PVP got a nice system righ tnow as far as I am concerned
[2:39:12] WhiteKnight74648: Someone does care!
[2:39:14] WhiteKnight74648: :-)
[2:39:15] Armdel: lol i literally hit 205 today
[2:39:16] Solid0Liquid: plus if the vault actually gave you upgrades the valor system wouuldn't be needed
[2:39:17] Mecabeast: atleast callings give a decent amt of gold
[2:39:18] ChrisarN: 9.1 with flying @Towelliee ?

[2:39:32] Forestrunner201: 205? I just got over 190... dang 1-2 hours to play a day
[2:39:38] jerexify: @Towelliee I don't even know that I'm considered a casual, since I raid at a Heroic level and am ilvl 213, and I still hated having to PVP for a 200 weapon...
[2:39:39] PadidinJones: @Towelliee Dont take this the wrong way but it sounds like you are more upset of this expac than BFA.
[2:39:41] Korupcija_: just go there and convoke stuff
[2:39:44] That1MiningGuy: the non-pvpers trying to gear in pvp ironically is what has made it easy LUL
[2:39:58] GazXIII: PVP players used to complain about templates and rng gearing. Now PVE players have to deal with that and PVPers complain
[2:40:00] Thunder4o: @That1MiningGuy exactly
[2:40:04] CrunkyBrewster: @That1MiningGuy dont remind me. i tried that route. its painful lol\
[2:40:08] excessior: let pve boosters make their gold again
[2:40:13] BigCarlM: go convoke eachother in pvp
[2:40:17] idenkaz_: i miss 8.3
[2:40:19] idenkaz_: hzate me
[2:40:25] Karbonn: I mean, let's be honest, most people who PVE casually don't PVP and they haven't had to to get higher item level gear before, so why make them now just to get ilvl?
[2:40:25] RamboSquirrel: @That1MiningGuy thats actually what i thought as now they dont have the "Easy wins"
[2:40:26] LordKain73: yea, stfu pvpers! KEKW
[2:40:29] hoodlife73: i miss bfa
[2:40:29] thebakeriscomingforu: azerite was garbage. essences and corruption were fun

[2:40:46] Templexx: hehe been waiting too long for pvp how it is now. i can pvp only now
[2:40:51] mizuryo: i miss twilight devestation FeelsBadMan
[2:40:54] CrunkyBrewster: Yup and the weekly Vault too. they doing fine as far as I look at it lol\
[2:40:56] SlayerLightStorm: PvPers need to stfu before Blizz nerfs them again.
[2:41:11] MisterD1rty: What they need is a tank that wears mail so there can ball all mail groups
[2:41:11] Decoy101: the freckle on the ass of the player base
[2:41:11] DehCantao: People will get jealous no matter what. So blizz has to stop seing each activity separately. It is not about pvp loot is good, m+ loot is bad.
[2:41:13] mansohi: I'm not a pvper, I'm pveer. our not talking for the majority. for love it's best in ew xpacs
[2:41:17] That1MiningGuy: they could always bring back hit capping and watch everyones brains explode
[2:41:20] Thunderpint: @locutusofazeroth bro I sitll have shit to farm from islands, hoping they making them soloable like they said they were gonna
[2:41:20] Shinji_Ex: BFA oof Kappa
[2:41:24] WastedWookiee: I get to play 2-3 hours about every other day. I've decided this isn't the game for me anymore. I played this game for over a decade but not being able to raid and all the IO elitists make it impossible.
[2:41:27] Darthyrevan: Yeah pvp shouldnt be touched now for 3/4 expansions :P
[2:41:42] Korupcija_: I think game would pop off then
[2:41:43] Buckwink: big true
[2:41:50] foobis_25: agreed lol
[2:41:53] schizowillie: I think I barely got to 190 and was already bored
[2:41:59] northcub: seems like only the elitist players are complaining about being gear gated, as a casual i am having a blast this expo
[2:42:02] George2001k: Would a similar gearing system work for raids? Like bosses drop bo Lott just points or currency and then you get to buy what you want? @towelliee
[2:42:06] Karbonn: Loot is a big reason why people even play the game. Not getting loot or having to work WAY too hard for loot makes people quit.
[2:42:07] CrunkyBrewster: amen
[2:42:10] That1MiningGuy: true that
[2:42:13] propoopimus: it's like mythic raiders caring about titanforging cause they are jealous of the one time some lfr warriors gets an item better than you
[2:42:15] Buckwink: current pvp system and pve with valor should never leave again
[2:42:18] Affiiance: Thats a good point
[2:42:28] bennythejet_ne: Does anyone know how long we’ll have to get ksm?
[2:42:28] Darthyrevan: @Towelliee for WoW President!
[2:42:33] Affiiance: So many boosters right now
[2:42:33] Lou_Diamonds: game about loot makes loot hard to get, more at 11
[2:42:37] Shinji_Ex: raiders are the 20% pvp are the 1% LUL
[2:42:43] mo197: have's have-not's
[2:42:44] Sloppy_Nachos: PVPers could care less about gear they just want to PVP but they are forced to gear.
[2:42:48] George2001k: Loot*
[2:42:49] WhiteKnight74648: how much was 1800 to 2100?
[2:43:12] Aro725: big true, 1400 is the new 2100 lol
[2:43:16] GazXIII: Just remove loot completely. PVE templates /s
[2:43:34] v1lly: I heard they would let us disenchant legendaries, was that just a rumour?
[2:43:35] mavericks312: what up towel
[2:43:41] Tinit5190: @Towelliee Is that a weak aura for the chest chance?
[2:43:46] northcub: we used to inspect players achieves to make sure they had not been carried and make fun of them for being bad - now people brag about being carried
[2:44:00] toogoo: i suck at pvp and pve so i just chill at 180 ilvl
[2:44:11] That1MiningGuy: yea i've still not adjusted to the new boost meta northcub LUL

[2:44:25] CrunkyBrewster: yeah 9.0.5
[2:44:27] That1MiningGuy: yea leebo1777!!!
[2:44:27] hoodlife73: what time are the rocket runs ?
[2:44:28] Masqerader: Blizzard could kill the boosting just by reducing rating for anyone who is playing with someone who achieved 1800 and above already, so it becomess so tedious its not worth it
[2:44:33] mavericks312: started mythic nathria last night huntsmen is a bitch
[2:44:34] Masqerader: *becomes
[2:44:38] leebo1777: Wow, nice
[2:44:45] CrunkyBrewster: @leebo1777 basically Valor for Mythic+
[2:44:50] doomester: @Towelliee just bring PVP Power and its done
[2:44:54] Getitonthelow: Valor points seem whack.. the i lvl is low to upgrade ilvl
[2:44:55] That1MiningGuy: secret world sorta has that
[2:45:05] That1MiningGuy: for the 13 ppl that still play it
[2:45:06] xRykku: GW2 is such a sleeper mmo. Its so good for a game thats not really in the spotlight
[2:45:07] schizowillie: Do PvP like Sea of Thieves
[2:45:14] scars_____: now bring back forging and we good
[2:45:18] Masqerader: doesn't work
[2:45:21] GermanBacon: whats the over/under on wipes here? kinamaHmm
[2:45:30] Masqerader: if the queuer leaves it takes the other person too
[2:45:35] excessior: it boots the whole party if you leave doesnt it
[2:45:36] Lou_Diamonds: should be none, lfr denathrius is insanely easy
[2:45:41] That1MiningGuy: yea I expect it to get a tuning pass or two in ptr
[2:45:48] iKONZ: 1=shot inc
[2:45:49] toogoo: @xrykku i went on the other day for the first time in years and saw people on mounts and flying mounts it was crazy
[2:45:55] sussyrev: good
[2:46:09] Thembones75: @Towelliee how do you feel about covenant changes
[2:46:17] GermanBacon: kinamaShucks make LFR hard again
[2:46:30] GazXIII: How they thought the current gearing system is accepatble just shows how out of touch they are though
[2:46:32] Sionz: Ion said that 6 weeks ago
[2:46:35] That1MiningGuy: to be fair, I feel like blizzard is doing balance patches in a better way now, instead of nerfing everyone down they are boosting underperformers, nice to see they figured that out finally
[2:46:36] Lou_Diamonds: idk about making it hard, but the last boss does seem too easy
[2:46:38] Getitonthelow: I've done everything raids and m+ every week and still only have 190 weps..
[2:46:44] excessior: make legacy legion raids easy again
[2:46:46] Masqerader: Spine of Death Wing Hard

[2:47:48] RamboSquirrel: @Towelliee currently a Ret Pala and dipping my toes into Prot. Whats the best advice you would give?

[2:50:33] PadidinJones: DBM tells you when to go through the portal usually
[2:50:34] GenMysters: just read the blue pist. it is a great idea. Completing in time to upgrade an item is fair. I think is you x2 all dungeons at a lvl you should get even more upgrade options as well. maybe even more valor or a bit higher item lvl upgrade.
[2:50:55] hoodlife73: nice @northcub be too

[3:28:38] Wulfgrym: Arthas i don't think would be in the maw, because he was manipulated by the power of the maw (frostmourne)
[3:28:41] Masqerader: Varian got sharded and sold on the AH by Gul'dan, he's probably in someones weapons enchant
[3:28:46] dym_jt: @Towelliee Varian should not be in the shadowlands at all since he was killed by fel, which SHOULD'VE destroyed his soul.

[3:30:28] dym_jt: Ya'll forgetting that Varian was killed by FEL magic, being killed by fel magic = soul destroyed @Towelliee
[3:30:28] Vigi9413: Varian is still scattered across the broken shore
[3:30:33] JansonLives: They didn't say it wasn't Varian so that makes it implied

[3:51:08] jimjambert: What is KSM?
[3:51:08] Shirey36: wrong @MistaHat
[3:51:19] Korupcija_: KSM is currently 2.5M gold
[3:51:21] MistaHat: @Shirey36 ok, i think im right, good talk
[3:51:34] Shirey36: ppl forget bliz doesnt balance around anything after +15s
[3:51:34] Arocian: what's the gold news?
[3:51:45] langiqc: isn't a ksm boost suposed to be hella expansive ?

[3:51:50] Jarlan23: yesterday there was more groups selling m+ then there was legit groups
[3:51:53] Twizted23faith: @jimjambert keystone master
[3:51:57] Jarlan23: 20 groups selling and only 10 legit ones
[3:51:59] Arocian: thanks
[3:52:01] Xilice: then they could bite the bullet and fix it @Shirey36 :P
[3:52:09] Gingerprimer: @Arocian with the new system ppl are going to be wanting to buy KSM so they can uppgrade to 220
[3:52:26] MistaHat: @Jarlan23 theres just more people posting, not necessarily actual runs. Still annoying and a problem though, i agree
[3:52:28] therad1calbrad1cal: i stopped doing torghast bc i got tired of it honestly.
[3:52:47] Xilice: They wrote that it is linked to achivements, but you would think it's for that specific character right?
[3:52:49] hagmania: i stopped my wow subscription LUL
[3:52:54] hoodlife73: choregast
[3:52:57] niebvelungen: @Towelliee no info yet if it is account shared right? So if you have KSM on you have it on every char.
[3:53:11] therad1calbrad1cal: kind of hate how you gotta do a bit of everything to stay geared and cant just do the 1 or 2 things you really like lol

[3:53:57] Xilice: I mean same for pvp right ? :P
[3:54:08] bobbycagg: doesnt work like that for pvp :-(
[3:54:09] Xilice: you have to push your alt to get higher rating gear
[3:54:11] fistofnature: Why not? its the same for pvp
[3:54:14] Skaboy_TV: Makes no sense you say. They're going to do it!!!

[3:54:51] Shirey36: now its time for the real players to shine PVE !
[3:54:52] robertjordan83: @Towelliee what about no pve path to 233 weapons?
[3:54:55] mo197: hahaha but my pvp alts.....waaaaa
[3:54:56] Xilice: well rewards are still better if you are good at pvp xD

[3:54:57] ZakuzaGB: and arguably still better than the new valor idea
[3:55:22] niebvelungen: I have not done 1 arena this Xpac bc i had to do arena in 8.3 for corruption which was not fun imo
[3:55:25] Xilice: you have a pve path to 233 thats mythic denathrius @robertjordan83 but i agree that M+ should also have a path to it
[3:55:27] TheGaoSora: it was always pvp country... =\
[3:55:37] nickolas52: that dot is actually weak
[3:56:18] That1MiningGuy: I feel weird that I love both pvp and pve lol
[3:56:27] That1MiningGuy: seems like ppl are divided
[3:56:47] robertjordan83: @Xilice thats offhand only, no?
[3:56:55] niebvelungen: @That1MiningGuy I hate pvp idk just not my kinda game, but m+ and raiding is the jam
[3:57:08] Xilice: @robertjordan83 the offhand is from stone legion generals - all specs get mainhand weps from denathrius
[3:57:08] biggiemcg33: biggiemcg33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 14 month streak! 
[3:57:12] langiqc: how much money people are willing to pay for a +15 run boost these days ?
[3:57:15] That1MiningGuy: for pvp though we do have 3 ways to get to the goal, and pve will only have M+ so account wide makes sense to me
[3:57:16] Scymplex: why would a pvper want to do M+ or raids when they can easily get the gear they want from pvp? i thought the whole idea of having multiple methods of getting gear to encourage everyone to do all activities in the game. it feels inverse for pvpers atm.
[3:57:47] Korupcija_: because valor and conquest is capped
[3:57:48] blove3103: what ilvl do you recommend starting M+ at?
[3:57:58] Korupcija_: so you can get more gear if you do everything
[3:57:59] Xilice: @Scymplex because it was a HUGE outcry in BFA that all the best pvp trinkets and so on came from raiding or dungeons
[3:58:26] thatsnice17: When you use chorus on a class with a pet, mobs will prioritize the pet instead of you and the heal on phase shift (3) heals your pets too, you can get to where you take 0 damage and can keep your pet alive forever
[3:58:31] pilhass10: pvper's are already full pvp geared LUL
[3:58:32] That1MiningGuy: I want both systems to shine.
[3:58:39] shimwood: If Blizz wanted players to do all content they'd lock gear behind pet battles
[3:58:46] doomester: @Towelliee also Pvpers can benifit from the change in PVE too
[3:58:48] That1MiningGuy: you're fucking evil shimwood
[3:58:51] That1MiningGuy: :D
[3:58:55] Kinghorn: yeah pvpers have been fully geared for weeks
[3:59:01] Kinghorn: why do they care about anything
[3:59:09] Korupcija_: 220 gear for world questers!
[3:59:34] TheGaoSora: @Kinghorn because when it's not about them they REEEE
[3:59:37] MuttonChopins: because they dont wanna see anyone else spoiled tlike they do @Kinghorn
[3:59:40] Xilice: callings can give higher gear than normal raid xD seems weird xD

[4:00:36] TheGaoSora: Kreygasm
[4:00:38] Xilice: as a druid im praying for that divine bell to drop @Towelliee :P
[4:00:59] Korupcija_: I didn't see bell on EU for a month
[4:00:59] piratechris: They will most likely implement something for the casuals who dont raid and do mythics too but that will come later
[4:01:19] Xilice: WQ was up in december last i think @Korupcija_ :P
[4:01:49] Malarick: have a 184 divine bell just waiting on valor....

[4:02:12] NILLme: i dont remember them announcing when they gonna release a patch this early
[4:02:22] Xilice: @Malarick they do write "M+ items" in the post so not sure you can upgrade WQ items
[4:02:30] xluckydawgx: @Towelliee Did you see you can view Great Vault anywhere now?
[4:02:45] xluckydawgx: in PTR
[4:03:00] banishtyrion: LUL

[4:04:27] That1MiningGuy: And if you played MoP it felt like half the damn expansion was delayed! that content draught was *real*
[4:04:42] Xilice: @Malarick "Gear from Mythic Keystone Dungeons is now upgradeable" ye it's sad we can't upgrade our bells :(
[4:04:43] NILLme: this is a systems patch
[4:04:45] piratechris: They are just introducing a well tested sytem and a few tweaks is all. No new content as such
[4:04:46] PvtHudson093: still dosnt fix loot drop rates
[4:04:58] DemonicGrizz: Hey I have kind of a dumb question but can a protection Pally be dps or do they always have tp be a tank?
[4:05:14] PuckyChips: Yeap, they basically turn m+ into bfa islands
[4:05:27] Naturalbeef: YOLO
[4:05:40] NILLme: people that time 15s probably already are geared with 220+ gear. Not sure why thats the cap
[4:05:42] TheGaoSora: it fixes M+ runs for next seasons, you can upgrade what you already worked hard to get
[4:05:44] Roffasauras: @DemonicGrizz only tanks, their dps spec is Ret
[4:05:47] robbiev45: how was raid earlier @Towelliee
[4:05:53] piratechris: Yeah no the stuff now just adresses lack of loot drops. They will still need to have a look at casuals in general later on

[4:08:04] TheUnknowing: I thought that system was just fine @Sollice I think they went too far to the end of the spectrum with gearing as it is, maybe we had too much in bfa but now it feels too little.

[4:09:16] BRUTALIT0PS: The thing I liked about BfA is being a father of 5 under age 9, being able to catch up fairly easy was nice
[4:09:16] luckfore: they can temporarily fix the loot issue by increasing the amount that drops, why dont they do it?

[4:10:20] Sollice: I think I have said this before, but on Sunday we killed Denathrius with 12 people and we literally got 1 loot drop. That does not feel good and there is no excuse for it. Legendaries and conduits if they do should NOT count to the total loot drops
[4:10:32] ChaoticPriest: They are. It'll be coming next week on the PTR and thereafter @Towelliee

[4:12:23] ChaoticPriest: Buffing the ones people aren't using as much. They said they want to stay away from nerfing ones that people invested in @Towelliee
[4:12:29] Masqerader: I would suspect they're gonna increase the ilvls too
[4:12:33] That1MiningGuy: They said they wanted to encourage people to play with all of them so they are going to buff the ones that are underused
[4:12:51] xvstormvx: @Towelliee buffing ones that people arnt using
[4:13:19] nickolas52: but by then everyone will have max lvl leggos so what to do with soul ash

[4:32:20] Vigi9413: these people are way more intelligent than I ever could be
[4:32:22] TheRavenGrave: its stupid that ppl use video cards to farm crypto
[4:32:24] northcub: are we 10 years in the past? there are entire movies made about this mining rigs and how the energy costs exceede the profits and how crypto is not sustainable
[4:32:26] Piztol_Whip: Expect your utility bill to go up mining with that kinda rig
[4:32:31] Troniin: The electric bill for that person has to be insane.
[4:32:32] That1MiningGuy: literally people crypto mining bringing down the entire cities power mining LUL
[4:32:32] Senthius09: the worst part is that not only are they sucking up all the current 3080 stock, they also run them to an inch of their lives and resell them to idiots
[4:32:33] whatitdo1738: one massive power bill lol
[4:32:35] PorAmor: Roughly 50k in cards he is mining with

[4:32:42] L4dy_Renegade: There would be better GPU's by then. LUL
[4:32:45] VGAPortAuthority: you can actually make money from farming. If you hold your currency you might hit the big times in the future. A 3070 and up will yield profit.
[4:32:47] CrimsonNurse: If you build a rig of 6 of them for about 10-11k you can make up your money in about 6 months
[4:32:51] 3663Sharad: But how do you makie money out of it? It sounds like a money machine ... infinite to be accurate

[4:33:15] CrimsonNurse: The real problem Towelliee is your electric bill will be crazy high then you also have to worry about heat
[4:33:22] camarac: @CrimsonNurse assuming crypto doesn
[4:33:23] PvtHudson093: free heating tho
[4:33:24] NILLme: you need good room AC too
[4:33:26] Lemonadrian: Cost of whole rig is estimated at 100k. He can get a return on his investment after 6.7 months if prices stay the same.
[4:33:30] AstridLory: Get solar panels
[4:33:30] Jarlan23: gonna be a big expense if he burns hs house down

[4:34:01] banishtyrion: :D
[4:34:03] PorAmor: @Shirey36 they can compute the algorithims quicker
[4:34:09] That1MiningGuy: Shirey36 basically it's because of the CUDA processing power and how fast it can perform complex calculations, all mining is is essentially solving algorithms
[4:34:30] PorAmor: @That1MiningGuy lol too much tech talk bud, make it short and sweet.
[4:34:36] L4dy_Renegade: Play like Ski Free from windows 3.1

[5:30:55] assman_ny: Ancient druids man
[5:30:56] Broomba: wow you are on the vinidcar
[5:30:57] Gnral: if you have good budget come to monaco '' luxury vegas Kappa
[5:31:01] piratechris: Yeah some pagans will take you and demostrate some nasty druidic ritual LUL
[5:31:07] SilkeySmooth: why would you raid if valor is back?
[5:31:08] raptorstrick: England
[5:31:21] g8unclenate: i did a bus tour in Scotland it was great.
[5:31:27] BCrums: 400 per 1 iLVL?
[5:31:31] thiccsushi: Can we at least buy the base gear with valor?
[5:31:35] justaguy34921: Cov changes are confusing as shit to try to read lol
[5:31:36] piratechris: And they have so much good scotch etc in the UK
[5:31:38] BCrums: so 400 to go from 207 to 208?

[5:31:51] BCrums: Or 400 to go 207 to 213?
[5:31:54] BCrums: Ok makes mores sonese
[5:31:59] Basinod: I got guildies mad at how late valor points are comin while im just happy we got them before 9.2
[5:32:06] klavattv: !VALOR
[5:32:23] raptorstrick: I was stationed in England
[5:32:58] Broomba: @towelliee - what requirements do u think will be to fly in SL pathfrinder.
[5:33:00] Creative_Pigeon: loot is the worst part of this expansion which sucks
[5:33:05] SilkeySmooth: raiding is done why raid when you can get valor
[5:33:11] yngwiemalmst: valor points are just catchup for alts at this point to keep ppl playing
[5:33:23] cevyr1: my guild which had an average of 20-25 players on a night is now lucky to hjave 8 or 9 a night now
[5:33:24] MilesC453: How can you look up sub numbers to see how they are doing
[5:33:26] PvtHudson093: i quit already because of loot drop rates
[5:33:26] gtmax69: that and who wants o do a bunch of shit for absolutely no reward.

[5:34:05] Broomba: she is soooo spoiled
[5:34:21] blade_killa: that's crazy talk!
[5:34:24] toobaked1987: Is that natural light in your office?? What is this madness
[5:34:25] mmrghost7: just bring back TF/WF , all casual players loved when they got mythic loot out of normal raid
[5:34:29] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Novasun00 (warning)
[5:34:29] SilkeySmooth: adding valor made raiding for gear useless
[5:34:49] That1MiningGuy: WutFace
[5:34:50] drewsky_british_kid: I haven’t seen raid yet either
[5:34:51] Broomba: lol
[5:34:51] NovaSun84: oops, next task for me will be to get my raider io greater than 0
[5:34:56] mrniceguy817: Lol your an idiot @silkeysmooth
[5:34:59] deadawake_: I only watch you and pikaboo lol
[5:35:14] Basinod: of course the casual players loved it lol
[5:35:21] Creative_Pigeon: I just want a way to replace gear doing content I like, and do a lot of
[5:35:29] PvtHudson093: I miss BFA
[5:35:34] bosseja: agree
[5:35:54] toobaked1987: Valor isnt going to fix anything for casuals, very, very slowly
[5:35:55] NovaSun84: I'd rather dissapoint 4 people in a group with Mythics than 20 people for existing in a heroic raid :)
[5:35:58] Ghostpuddlez: Just think, we can still be playing BFA
[5:35:58] redtemplar88: I like this change. If someone can't time 10's they shouldn't get the heroic ilvl
[5:36:00] mwchaos: they shouldve made the cap 226
[5:36:05] mwchaos: just like pvp
[5:36:10] Masqerader: I can't wait to get a bunch of valor points so when I get no loot from a mythic + or useless items from my vault I will feel good
[5:36:10] remyfortier: it only lets you upgrade to 220 idk how much easier it could get now
[5:36:16] piratechris: Its panic mode
[5:36:21] piratechris: They hit the big red button
[5:36:22] EthicalHermit: I hope you can buy the base item you want with Valor as well, otherwise you still have to farm the item to upgrade @Towelliee
[5:36:23] thejakewilliams: At this point I'm 215 ilvl and waiting on weekly vault 223s for upgrades. So 213 valor upgrades are barely going to scratch the surface
[5:36:24] nazzari01: nope because with casual you still would have to do all 15s which isn't easy with a casual player
[5:36:31] bc_23_: I’m a casual with I’ll 202 on 2 characters
[5:36:48] bc_23_: Catchup is working fine
[5:36:48] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:36:50] remyfortier: its not gonna do anything for people thaat have done enough 10+'s/pvp to have mostly 220 items
[5:36:58] Hielloz: thyre gonna timegate so hard we gonna forget what game we playing
[5:36:58] Masqerader: If they had left mythic + alone + loot they'd be fine.. they wanted to fuck with it, now they're paying for it.
[5:37:02] piratechris: Honestly I wish they would fix their servers.. I mean 10 sec delay from key push to action actually triggering... it's not good enough
[5:37:05] NastyHarry: NastyHarry subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 111 months, currently on a 111 month streak! Woop! 111!
[5:37:32] remyfortier: i think if they want to make the gearing faster they should make the chest loot from mythics the same as the vault ilvl
[5:37:32] D3m0nHunt3r666: i wonder if it isnt faster to just rollback changes from BFA
[5:37:36] That1MiningGuy: I mean as a business you have to attract both the casual and the hardcore, if people are doing KSM to get there are they really casual? is it just because of the boosint that you think it is?
[5:37:36] SumZeroGG: An effort based gearing system is good, but casuals should have gear based on the effort right?
[5:37:37] piratechris: A month... try two months
[5:37:38] TheDustyMiles: people don't realize not everyone enjoys PVP and this is a good alternative for now for alts
[5:37:39] HotHotHeals: timing 15s takes longer than getting a carry in pvp or raiding
[5:37:52] Antdavs24: that was my thoughts exactly, i bet a bunch of casuals havent even touched a 10 yet lol
[5:37:52] redtemplar88: As a casual I do not expect 220 gear. Let the people that put in the work get the highest ilvl.
[5:37:53] That1MiningGuy: boosint = boosting I totally flubbed that lol
[5:37:54] SaltySnacker13: here comes the mythic+ boosts
[5:37:55] idenkaz_: +15 is no casual content im sorry.
[5:38:10] Kael88: getting KSM is not as hard, you just need to learn the dungeons or pay for a carry
[5:38:12] mrniceguy817: imo doing heroic pug raid with 14 man group last night cause I’m casual and 1 piece of loot per boss is a huge problem
[5:38:17] yngwiemalmst: M+ gold carries go brrr
[5:38:20] Antdavs24: @magemyway facts
[5:38:28] remyfortier: those people know its not casual too they're just trying to flex when they say tht
[5:38:32] nazzari01: you are so right
[5:38:33] filos0phia: really?
[5:38:36] piratechris: How can you honestly mean mythic +15 is casual.. It ain't anywere close to casual
[5:38:40] Balzofsteels: i dont raid and start back in SL and i have KSM pretty easy
[5:38:44] Brewtality55: TROOF
[5:38:48] MourvinMad: yeah im pretty casual still trying to learn how to heal in 10+
[5:38:51] nazzari01: very true, i'm casual and I have mostly 12s and completed all Heroic CN
[5:38:51] filos0phia: I started playing in 8.3 and timed all 20s before the end of the xpac with no guild
[5:38:52] Creative_Pigeon: I'm working right now just to get every 10 timed as an unholy DK
[5:38:54] filos0phia: just pugging
[5:38:55] nazzari01: So you are very right
[5:38:56] remyfortier: whenever people talk about how easy 15's are its like ok but how long did you play to get good enough to do them ?
[5:38:58] remyfortier: lol
[5:38:59] Roffasauras: could be worst, could be 3 pieces of loot per 40 man Kappa
[5:39:09] KingDwreckk: KingDwreckk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! i think if they would have had the system from the get to it would have been better recieved, but now its just silly
[5:39:14] thejakewilliams: Then you've also gotta be a meta class to get invite
[5:39:16] Apokolipz: monkaSoap
[5:39:16] foxies_havocing: i puged all 15s but I am veng tho
[5:39:17] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: agreed
[5:39:21] Masqerader: remember they have a FUCKING lust button
[5:39:21] Bleusempai: bruh, i waited for over 30 minutes for a 10+ yesterday, then the key leader quit after the first wipe
[5:39:22] idenkaz_: one week into the exp and the door for casuals is closed. they wont accept you just to be nice.
[5:39:24] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Epidoral (warning)
[5:39:31] SumZeroGG: Rule 1 of ksm: DONT pug
[5:39:31] filos0phia: in 8.3 I got ksm as a pug and started playing in july :( am i a nerd
[5:39:33] northcub: as a casual I don't even know what KSN satands for
[5:39:34] schizowillie: I have never even done a mythic 0 it's a new system to me haven't played since Cataclysm
[5:39:35] Creative_Pigeon: just time all 15s 4Head
[5:39:42] fewyn: BACON

[5:39:47] lanara233: Yummy :)
[5:39:50] That1MiningGuy: KSM is keystone master
[5:39:54] SilkeySmooth: mythic zero needs a queue system ro bring more people in to m+
[5:39:55] That1MiningGuy: means you've cleared all of the 15s
[5:39:55] TheDustyMiles: I think everyone doesnt realize that yea this tier is close to over BUT THIS will be implemented and be able to be used for next tier as well where once again the ilvl will go up
[5:39:57] Bacon_21: you called? Kappa
[5:39:57] piratechris: Bacon... om'nom'nom *drool*
[5:40:03] Masqerader: She should apply for the next Masterchef when that show comes back
[5:40:11] northcub: ke stone master - ok thank you
[5:40:14] northcub: key
[5:40:23] nazzari01: too far
[5:40:24] L4dy_Renegade: Personally, I feel like Legion was one of the best expansions, aside from the raining legendary weapons, of course.

[5:42:47] yoitsGrowl: I really do like you @Towelliee, and please dont think that I'm just being an ass...but why do you complain about the game so often man?
[5:42:51] Epidoral: Ye but no way it's 97...
[5:43:13] piratechris: They still stand too loose way more subs with the current stuff they have planned yeah
[5:43:15] filos0phia: agreed and that seems fair
[5:43:31] filos0phia: I feel like where they have valor set looks really nice
[5:43:35] onionenjoyer_flo: towUnforch
[5:43:39] Timozuna: im super casual then i figured 200 was alright
[5:43:42] filos0phia: easy to gear alts, easy for casuals to merc general content
[5:44:01] lanara233: @Timozuna I guess I'm also supercausal then (200)
[5:44:05] Epidoral: You didn't open the box
[5:44:06] I_DoctorSatan_I: man, Raiders are S A L T Y about the new Valor point gear system for Mythic+ players on the WoW Forums. Especially how +10/15 Achieves for 213 and 220 is "Account Wide".
[5:44:33] filos0phia: wait
[5:44:34] LAMBOJIMMI99: You did
[5:44:35] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:44:37] filos0phia: it's account wide
[5:44:39] filos0phia: ???
[5:44:48] DrakeDuude: @Towelliee My concern is the "cap" and how limiting it will be
[5:44:53] filos0phia: that'd be broken
[5:44:57] jure__: achievs are accound wide, but you will still have to grind out the valor on each char
[5:44:58] northcub: your entire World of Warcraft experience revolves around your Ilvl
[5:44:59] swordart_19: @i_doctorsatan_i You should not read forums, waste of time and just bunch of crybabies who spend more time then than game.
[5:45:04] I_DoctorSatan_I: yea, both timing +10 and +15's is account wide
[5:45:37] thiccsushi: I thought the item has to drop first in order to upgrade
[5:45:40] Masqerader: But the same problem with valor system remains, if loot don't drop, and vault gives u shit, ur still gonna be waiting lol
[5:45:48] Roffasauras: @I_DoctorSatan_I thank god, I didn't feel like doing that with alts
[5:45:59] PhoenixAuTv: Whens season 1 end for the mythic plus mounts @Towelliee ?
[5:46:16] L4dy_Renegade: This guy is the man wearing his luckky tmog, stylin' and profilin'. He's gonna get that rocket.
[5:46:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Masqerader Not really since M+ is spamable unlike raiding
[5:46:32] HumanityDH: all 17s should be 226 upgrade and all 20s should be 233 weapon
[5:46:34] EndoRushx: you can literally afk in epic bgs and get 197 and a +15 is only 10 ilvls higher???
[5:46:45] Masqerader: @I_DoctorSatan_I spamming matters not if you don't get the right key, or your loot doesn't drop.
[5:46:47] swordart_19: @masqerader there will be like vendor with gear.
[5:46:49] L4dy_Renegade: Haters gonna hate. Kappa
[5:47:09] Jarlan23: probably because 15+ you need to be playing a certain class
[5:47:11] mmrghost7: cuz then casuall will cry , cry hard
[5:47:14] ashwing_: What casual will get to above 15 LUL
[5:47:19] swordart_19: @masqerader you should get info before talking KEKW
[5:47:25] filos0phia: I don't think blizzard wants to balance those things tho
[5:47:29] Jarlan23: level keys at 17+ you wont get invited unless ur a meta class
[5:47:33] Ghostpuddlez: no, keep at 15 please
[5:47:49] Masqerader: @swordart_19 they never said anything about vendors lol
[5:48:06] L4dy_Renegade: I like his wingalings.
[5:48:16] swordart_19: @masqerader go read blue post you clown
[5:48:20] filos0phia: we saw it in the past, the mechanics create immergent one shots as the rank goes up and certain situations arise with no counter play at higher key levels. Blizzard doesn't want to have to balance the game beyond 15s because the scaling makes it near impossible
[5:48:21] Bixster: because +15 is doable with every group class/spec combo. i dont think this can be said for a +20.
[5:48:30] Masqerader: @swordart_19 I have
[5:48:50] filos0phia: and players would be furious if they couldn't get a mount or something because they weren't the right class/comp
[5:49:00] mmrghost7: @Jarlan23 ofc u dont ppl want best for their keys

[5:52:35] mufo85: this is the least I've ever played

[5:53:25] PvtHudson093: If it was for casuals you wouldnt have locks on the ilvl by attaching an achievment to it

[5:53:44] L4dy_Renegade: towUnforch
[5:53:49] Ghostpuddlez: ty @thiccsushi
[5:53:49] ScalarGaming: fair enough
[5:54:14] Fondre01: they are giving you bad luck protection
[5:54:15] Demanisraar: Praying to RNGesus for you @Towelliee hope that it drops for you this year m8
[5:54:17] sdpercussion: it's pretty simple. valor means we don't have to pvp to get geared for high keys. you can grind the content you want to play now
[5:54:28] Fondre01: didnt get that trinket at 210, upgrade it
[5:54:43] byrdeen45: easy to lv but noty alt friendly becouse of loot
[5:54:46] birdstuff_: Why are people crying about this? Not all people have time to play wow all day
[5:54:58] VanillaRiceTx: valor is back? already?
[5:55:01] L4dy_Renegade: It'll drop. I know it will. Maybe on try 100?
[5:55:04] sdpercussion: do 15's, get 210's, then up them to 220 and collect your 226 each week from vault. no more bs
[5:55:04] rootslang: What does valor do
[5:55:08] verrs3d: Will you be able to upgrade current m+ you already have ?
[5:55:13] Fondre01: I think its great, should have scaled master up to 226 like 2100 is
[5:55:21] thiccsushi: The problem is they didnt say if you can buy the base item with valor or you have to pray to get that piece to drop in order to upgrade
[5:55:21] Fondre01: other than that no issues
[5:55:22] deadawake_: you have to unlock an achev? fuckkk
[5:55:27] mrniceguy817: That’s my current problem getting the gear to get into higher keys since I refuse to do pvp
[5:55:38] Bixster: but it gives players a goal to work towards

[5:55:45] EndoRushx: this just in KSM is no longer account wide
[5:55:54] RunningOutOfRAM: D: R word
[5:56:01] piratechris: Most of the subscribing playerbase dont raid and dont do mythic dungeons
[5:56:07] Demanisraar: People are whining, gear is obsolete so fast it doesn't matter

[5:56:23] sdpercussion: you'll need the new season 15's
[5:56:26] VanillaRiceTx: what achievement?
[5:56:30] Ghostpuddlez: what acheive?
[5:56:34] jerexify: I can't get it now... lol Our group isn't able to clear 15s yet.
[5:56:36] yokai_5: !valor
[5:56:39] yngwiemalmst: yeah that seems obvious it is retroactive haha
[5:56:40] mavus: +5s are a stretch for a lot of casuals
[5:56:40] xvstormvx: @Towelliee what is keystone this round
[5:56:42] CanadianHellMoose: of course
[5:56:44] Ithylz: Yes
[5:56:44] Fondre01: 0.5 update wont be a new season
[5:56:47] VanillaRiceTx: oh
[5:56:49] Ithylz: Like PVP season
[5:56:49] Fondre01: has to carry over
[5:56:52] Ithylz: IT's the same
[5:56:55] Dewars: just make it account wide pls
[5:56:58] Ithylz: No of course
[5:57:03] Nehcrom: towUnforch towUnforch
[5:57:05] Ithylz: I meant for 9.1
[5:57:12] Demanisraar: no , the new season will be a month later LUL
[5:57:13] CanadianHellMoose: you will already have the achievement, they arent going to take it away
[5:57:15] idenkaz_: they miss the point by a mile. casuals wont do hight m+ what i consider to start at +10, they want to avoid this content because of so many reasons. it doesnt fix anything and gating behind an arch is bs imo.
[5:57:16] sdpercussion: who cares about 220 gear in March. It's all about being able to gear up in keys in 9.1
[5:57:23] Dewars: ksm every season probably
[5:57:26] sdpercussion: without pvp
[5:57:38] talmadimtv: @Towelliee what is you got the achivement back in legion
[5:57:38] Fondre01: @sdpercussion exactly
[5:57:58] Fondre01: 100% about having a viable alternate path in 9.1
[5:57:59] mwchaos: yes that is 90% of the benefit, for next tier youre right
[5:58:16] Lazugo: the thing thats make me mad is this phrase " While the Vault should represent a major goal and THE SOURCE OF THE BEST REWARDS" ehh i litteraly can pvp al the hell the i want and get my best setup without the vault @Towelliee
[5:58:18] teqnikirl: Wait I’m lost, they brought back Valor ?
[5:58:20] sdpercussion: itll be a nice catchup in march, but what matters is s2 m+ is no longer dead
[5:58:35] mwchaos: yes which feels great @sdpercussion
[5:58:41] sdpercussion: agreed
[5:58:47] Fondre01: @lazugo yes, they should be dropping 2100 gear to 220 to match
[5:58:48] Delacrois: I think in the ptr the achievement is link to the mount makes it seem like it would be account wide and retroactive for people who has ksm now
[5:58:57] L4dy_Renegade: towUnforch
[5:58:58] birdstuff_: Thats not ideal at all, casuals are not gonna get keystone master lol
[5:59:02] JacobBose: I got the rare maldraxus mount yesterdary
[5:59:14] teqnikirl: Somebody fill me in I haven’t logged in since PVP gave the best gear and me raiding for no gear made me hate the game.
[5:59:21] Dewars: they didnt say its a cathup system but a gearing update in general
[5:59:36] yngwiemalmst: i dont think it will be account wide for the same reason pvp ratings arent account wide
[5:59:43] HotHotHeals: omg raider io is going to be everything now lol
[5:59:47] sdpercussion: ya i doubt account wide
[5:59:51] idenkaz_: lmao good luck with that
[5:59:52] Roffasauras: I have 2 15s timed, but I still have Sanguine Depths and Spires under 10 LUL
[5:59:53] sdpercussion: fresh alts buying 220?
[5:59:55] Dewars: when do you think S2 comes out?

[6:00:04] laughing_octopus: u need to get the gear
[6:00:08] Ghostpuddlez: its only +10? thought it was +15's
[6:00:14] EthicalHermit: plus doing the 10's will get you the 220 vault loot til then
[6:00:18] jimmix12: not this week kays this week is a pain in the a..
[6:00:26] yngwiemalmst: oih man 8 ads
[6:00:30] mwchaos: it should be account wide, this is an alt friendly xpac guys
[6:00:31] yngwiemalmst: F
[6:00:37] Venkxx: lets just hope it is atleast accountwide
[6:00:52] PokerFaceMoose: will there be a weekly cap like conquest?
[6:00:58] Robbyodom2: when will they increase the ilvl of heirloom gear?
[6:00:59] mwchaos: yes there will be
[6:01:02] Roffasauras: reading the post, upgrading gear is based on the achievement, so it should be account wide
[6:01:04] JacobBose: Do you have a healer shaman calling towelitte?
[6:01:11] Delacrois: the only real questing I have is will I be able to upgrade the gear I have now or will it have to drop after the patch drops
[6:01:27] TazeMeh: Vault loot sucks. I've gotten the same loot week after week, and have gotten that same loot during the dungeons and raid as well. Maybe I'm just very unlucky, but a few of my buds feel the same way.
[6:01:31] JacobBose: i raided with one last night. Buddy must have used your name
[6:01:44] rillo5: @towelliee weren’t you saying like a day ago how wow never sticks to their plans for expansions anymore. That’s what the valor change is right?

[6:03:53] Xistaben: Isn't GFUEL coming out with new flavors?

[6:05:21] Thoreya: they said sometime in march
[6:05:26] teqnikirl: @hoodzfighter that’s counterintuitive to the games design. Stop with the toxic mentality of superiority complex. You’re not a better player because you do an 18 to somebody who does a 15
[6:05:50] glassbomben: Is big love rocket really 1-100?
[6:05:57] piratechris: March 2022

[6:07:29] Thoreya: yes lol
[6:07:30] EthicalHermit: how many weeks until renown 40?
[6:07:33] teqnikirl: @hoodzfighter that’s not how it works. ItemLevel was never introduced into the game.
[6:07:36] wreckedgum: some people think 2200 is easy to get, its not
[6:07:42] teqnikirl: In its original concept *
[6:07:44] zigzugg: me :)
[6:07:45] HumanityDH: i do but it wasnt easy
[6:07:46] StraightErro: Since you are going in reverse, what if you get it on Towelliee, as the last run of the day?
[6:07:47] aakduce: what level do u have to be to get the mount
[6:07:55] piratechris: Not even if I paid 5 mill gold would I get that
[6:07:58] mmrghost7: i have 0 , working my way
[6:07:59] Masqerader: and miss out on all that rng from mythic +?
[6:08:00] teqnikirl: 2400 is not that hard to obtain, you just RBG.
[6:08:04] hildobagins: i think it is harder now with all the boosting
[6:08:07] yngwiemalmst: imo they just need to make pvp gear terrible in pve haha why is vers so good right now
[6:08:09] Bladeheart_91: 4 more resets till renown 40 @EthicalHermit
[6:08:10] EddieMalfunction: takes days and days of doing nothing but BG's
[6:08:20] EthicalHermit: thats my guess for 9.0.5, when you hit renown 40 @Bladeheart_91
[6:08:22] That1MiningGuy: yea rated bgs is probably the best way to get it, but in arenas, pft... I'd be happy with 1600 right now LUL
[6:08:45] teqnikirl: @towelliee anybody can get 2400 with 50% win rate
[6:08:49] laughing_octopus: ya idd
[6:08:49] ThatW0lF: Bulloni
[6:08:49] CozzyFlannel: RBGs isn't easy but it is MUCH easier than arena
[6:08:54] feherlofia123: its not easy , im 1600
[6:08:58] laughing_octopus: rbgs are hard af
[6:09:07] Garrujak: Everything is "easy" to the wow community, just don't ask them to link armory

[6:11:17] Kromede: hold my beer
[6:11:20] ThrasiusGG: As a new player to WoW I dislike that PVP feels like gated content without an option to solo queue. I don't have friends that play the game and my guild's focus is PVE. I don't want to swap guild because I like the people
[6:11:37] That1MiningGuy: use the group finder
[6:11:43] That1MiningGuy: plenty of ppl do low cr groups
[6:11:44] bennythejet_ne: surprised boosting isn't against TOS

[6:26:40] ShadesOBlue: i mean, until the maw raid drops, i don't care what they add to the maw :/

[6:27:12] Densetsu_: Another forge WutFace
[6:27:17] dozilla: i'm done with Stygia, unless i somehow get a mount which i can't seem to get since my mage is awful in torghast
[6:27:23] luckfore: nice something else i wont have to do :)
[6:27:40] VictorAvalanche: if i spent that time in twisting corridor just for ppl to get a easy mount for the Maw im going to be hot
[6:27:44] byrdeen45: i do the maw once a week then done dont like the place
[6:27:46] Affiiance: We have been down this road before we know
[6:27:47] CozzyFlannel: Doesnt sound mandatory so shouldnt bother most people
[6:27:51] cevyr1: i didn't hear a good reason to go back into the maw
[6:27:58] Densetsu_: So, whos the final boss in the next raid? Sylvanas?
[6:28:17] KumaEnjoyer: kel'thuzad
[6:28:29] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Densetsu_ mmm, dont think so. Probaly a Drust themed Raid
[6:28:40] mvk315: im stuck at 198 would that benefit me?
[6:28:42] StraightErro: Like the Dark iron forge and anvil in BRD?
[6:28:59] CozzyFlannel: Anduin next raid boss pog
[6:29:01] luckfore: 9.1 raid will be naxx 3.0
[6:29:02] Densetsu_: @I_DoctorSatan_I Wasnt the next raid called "the maw raid" in the data mining?
[6:29:02] I_DoctorSatan_I: Redemption for Sylvanas!!! towQueen towQueen

[6:29:36] LolitaAldea: yep
[6:29:37] fewyn: anduin is def going to be a raid boss
[6:29:38] cevyr1: god its true
[6:29:38] AcidAbyss: what if they try to martyr thrall
[6:29:38] rocthenite: can you inmangin the allaince tears
[6:29:41] Trollhat: TYRANDE TOO
[6:29:41] fewyn: we'll have to defeat him to save him
[6:29:45] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: i want to kill anduin as a boss..that would be cool. N one should touch my queen
[6:29:51] Durithane: yeah, and it's BS
[6:29:56] I_DoctorSatan_I: Kinda like Dark Samus. OoOOoo...imagine a "Dark Samus" type of Anduin raid boss....
[6:30:03] mvk315: whhat class is this?
[6:30:04] Densetsu_: I think it will be Sylvanas, we will be helping Anduin. But she will probably not die...
[6:30:08] oRiie: Sylvanas will break down and save him and then die for it; it's her redemption arc 1000% before she dies calling it now
[6:30:13] piratechris: So we kill Anduin and Jaina takes the throne?
[6:30:23] CozzyFlannel: idk how they turn Andruin into a DK and kill thrall in the same xpac
[6:30:28] Tigerklaue: baine should be a raid boss so he has some use
[6:30:30] Ogumel: best chance to kill off anduin, tyrande, and sylvanas.
[6:30:44] Lazugo: https://twitter.com/Fleks27/status/1359241657762394116/photo/1 i love this guys so much
[6:31:33] Wulfgrym: varian won't die......
[6:31:36] ShadesOBlue: greymayne shattered the lantern
[6:31:42] Garrujak: Make her the jailer
[6:31:43] FresheFefe: sylvanos
[6:31:45] Masqerader: We still haven't seen Nathanos yet in SL
[6:31:45] Sillo: Sylvanas gets redeemed and becomes the ruler of pandaria
[6:31:47] oRiie: Banshee queen will die, she'll be redeemed as Windrunner for saving Anduin I'm betting
[6:31:49] Garrujak: this way we never have to see her again
[6:31:49] HaloS23: @Towelliee HA same was said about Varian.....
[6:31:57] louisvuittoon: !valor
[6:31:58] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[6:32:00] I_DoctorSatan_I: @oRiie Right, because she's acting like Arthas right now holding the sword to Anduins chest, ready to turn him. As Anduin stated, Sylvanas never had a choice, it was taken from her. Where now, she has the choice to turn Anduin or to die for her consenqences.
[6:32:03] Kamikaze_MarLon: isnt uther in the same team as sylvanas now?
[6:32:09] Densetsu_: Like Arthas? Or Illidan? Kappa
[6:32:10] othraerir: what? christ
[6:32:20] Lazugo: Imagine fleks on 9.1 going to venari and upgrading the shit ou of conduits LOL

[6:32:35] yokai_5: that is me
[6:32:36] Ogumel: I haven't been to the Maw and Torghast in a month.
[6:32:38] adxx: they gonna kill off anduin like they killed rick in the walking dead
[6:32:41] bennythejet_ne: is it worth socket upgrades or to just upgrade conduits
[6:32:42] cevyr1: The Maw is completely miserible
[6:32:45] Masqerader: I go for the weekly quest , my ash then done
[6:32:46] Venkxx: exalted and I am done, dont care for that shit of an area
[6:32:46] Todmeister9000: The Maw is not that bad, ppl are overreacting
[6:32:47] FresheFefe: not worthy
[6:32:47] yngwiemalmst: im just doing the weeklies, almost exalted haha
[6:32:48] othraerir: once i got exalted i just do the weeklies and dailies sometimes
[6:32:51] Riggoz1: I dont go to the maw.. the sockets I dont care about the huge time it takes
[6:32:53] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: i hate the maw and my main is a fricking druid...
[6:32:56] cevyr1: I stopped going into the maw weeks ago
[6:32:58] luckfore: if youre a casual like most ppl are, the maw is completely ignorable
[6:32:59] Tigerklaue: maw with mount is fine
[6:32:59] CursedVenom: i started the maw once i got the torghast mount
[6:33:03] Crocfacex: i cant be bother with the mmaw they can keep there sockets
[6:33:05] cevyr1: I get my souls and thats it
[6:33:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just go to rescue souls now
[6:33:11] ShadesOBlue: i stopped once i got the rep pattern from ve'nari
[6:33:14] othraerir: there's plenty of those mounts running around
[6:33:20] NexLap: @Towelliee do you feel heroic sire might be one of the harder first raid teir end bosses ?
[6:33:21] Noshpan: The Maw is fucking awful. I'd rather walk around the Black Shroud from FFXIV 1.0
[6:33:23] FruckAwesome: its just annoying
[6:33:28] Densetsu_: 2 chars? WutFace ur craycray
[6:33:29] FruckAwesome: and TC is rough for some
[6:33:31] BrocelotXII: Its still bad content, its just faster
[6:33:31] ixt000: I just do weekly quests in maw and I'm done
[6:33:32] Xistaben: be a druid
[6:33:35] yetibrother: even on hunter/druid the maw is so boring
[6:33:36] byrdeen45: ive tried to get the mount just cant do it
[6:33:37] ixt000: I just dont enjoy it
[6:33:37] CozzyFlannel: The maw isn't bad its just boring. Same rares, same quests.
[6:33:39] cevyr1: Not all of us have the Twisting Corridors Mount
[6:33:39] dozilla: mount would make it much more fun, not in my cards
[6:33:42] phantumtheory: same thank you very much for the souls but fuck that place
[6:33:42] DaxxTMI: you can mount now?
[6:33:43] Wildside1177: I ain't grinding for that mount. I am following the "get soul ash only" method.
[6:33:47] billybaroo1: odds are better in vegas than this love rocket mount lul
[6:34:01] FresheFefe: g'huun
[6:34:04] luckfore: nzoth was harder
[6:34:09] Dewars: harder than KJ?
[6:34:27] cheersfordoobies: maw mount makes the maw and alts a joke i love it
[6:34:30] xvstormvx: @Towelliee did you see max'x undercover heroic raid on youtube??
[6:34:40] Timozuna: arent those riders like everywhere that you can take the mounts from as well
[6:34:54] bennythejet_ne: ksm mount should work in the maw
[6:34:56] Densetsu_: Sire HC was a pain, but pretty fun.
[6:34:59] EddieMalfunction: best video ive seen in a long time
[6:35:06] Crocfacex: are you ever going to play your old ally dark iron pally this expansion ay all?
[6:35:28] NexLap: tanking sire is fun, But there is a ton going on.

[6:35:42] Kromede: 200IQ
[6:35:43] shimwood: Yeah the mount mobs are everywhere, but that'd require crybabies to play the game and kill trash
[6:35:44] yngwiemalmst: as a healer H sire is a really fun fight
