[0:20:48] Killshotz_24: I dont know how MW (Fisting) works not trying to be rude at all
[0:21:19] Synckery: its weird to me how disc has to keep atonement up, yet fist doesnt have to keep anything up to heal partners
[0:21:34] Killshotz_24: But thanks homie I just started playing monk recently so trying to learn from the pro
[0:21:50] dolanknoob: atonement should last much longer for sure
[0:22:01] Synckery: True I guess, I was more thinking of a buff on your team mates vs a self buff
[0:22:04] Synckery: but yeah

[0:32:06] zerx_gg: oh yeah? show your feet rn
[0:32:12] dolanknoob: foot pedals are genius for targeting party members honestly
[0:32:15] cashewdad: Thinking of learning a healer in pvp just to get faster q times in SS. Which healer do you guys think is the most "entry level"?
[0:32:16] dolanknoob: I use mouse buttons.
[0:32:23] slacker0420: is that the home depot song?
[0:32:29] driftwood_tc: @zerx_gg SNIFFA feet cam reveal.
[0:32:32] cashewdad: I have 2300 xp with hpal from back in wotlk and cata but I am sure that doesn't really apply now
[0:32:41] KralHor: joke aside, i use mouse wheel for that
[0:33:09] bobby27444: its his job
[0:33:13] dolanknoob: I have a logi g503. the 2 buttons next to left click target party 1 and 2, then the button next to thumb is target self. works great
[0:33:24] dolanknoob: scroll up is target enemy, scroll down is trink
[0:33:25] unborncorn: @cashewdad holy priest is fairly simple and straightforward
[0:33:40] slacker0420: scroll up is party 1 scroll down is party 2 for me
[0:34:08] bobby27444: are you playing fist
[0:34:08] dolanknoob: yeah awful lobby for ya
[0:34:09] cashewdad: @unborncorn Nice ok - I do have a max level priest and almost 3k io in m+ as disc so that shouldn't take me too long to adapt
[0:34:44] slacker0420: i also use target of target macros that function normally if i hit an enemy
[0:35:26] slacker0420: it FEELS like i have more uptime even its placoebo

[0:37:47] hamsti: i don't actually understand why they gutted melee wings and fistweaver is still like this KEKw
[0:37:56] soothingmistmonk: How dare you kill Pinky the hound!  I'm calling PETA
[0:38:12] zerx_gg: yeah u got pwnd
[0:38:17] zerx_gg: xdd
[0:38:24] slacker0420: fistweaver feels the worst and the best at the sametime
[0:38:44] slacker0420: only melee wings
[0:38:46] dolanknoob: they were melee wings only for a bit
[0:38:47] hamsti: you had to commit to melee wings most of the time. no real hybrid spec
[0:39:00] zachgamegodx: @hamsti ya but it wasnt perma was it?
[0:39:00] ubercody: whats your timezone ven
[0:39:03] zachgamegodx: i actually forget
[0:39:06] titchyyy: titchyyy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months! 
[0:39:07] hamsti: Didn't like that design for hpal i guess
[0:39:07] JustDai_TV: melee wings was still never 100% melee, half the time it was judgment topping people
[0:39:09] hamsti: not sure
[0:39:16] dolanknoob: melee wings was terrible, i refused to play hpal during that period
[0:39:21] dolanknoob: got cc'd all game
[0:39:26] KralHor: absence of capability to produce complex solutions
[0:39:28] soothingmistmonk: Fistweaver just needs to be its own spec of monk.
[0:39:28] slacker0420: melee wings felt pretty bad to play
[0:39:31] zachgamegodx: oh they had aura of reckoning in the first szn
[0:39:36] zachgamegodx: that was pretty big for melee wings
[0:39:44] storm_chaser_ron: i dont remember melee wings doing actual meaningful dam and also didnt have a kick
[0:39:44] zachgamegodx: rubcub was the king of melee wings
[0:39:48] zachgamegodx: in legion
[0:39:53] hamsti: yeah aura of reckoning basically was aoe loh
[0:40:03] hamsti: but why gut melee wings entirely to compensate PrideShrug
[0:40:07] crymorre: rukiBlankie my favorite part of your tier list videos is listening to you debate copium addicts in chat
[0:40:10] fiestashaman: raise the MMR because the MIESTRO said so
[0:40:16] slacker0420: melee wings felt really good im M+
[0:40:18] slacker0420: season 1
[0:40:36] zachgamegodx: remember at blizzcon he nearly beat boetars team with an underdog comp
[0:40:42] wtfidkx: the king of melee wings was DEF DEATHLOBSTA
[0:40:48] soothingmistmonk: I think @venruki and the Miestro can be bestest friends! Kappa
[0:41:13] zachgamegodx: i really hope you watched his react video to ur "pvp needs help" vid
[0:41:19] hamsti: its 60 degrees here today...... freaking false spring
[0:41:37] soothingmistmonk: Ask him to que just one sesh for the content.
[0:41:37] Hobblefoot: What the heck, Mr. Ruki!  I thought we were best friends!
[0:41:50] cyborg1141: No
[0:41:57] slacker0420: i have 2
[0:41:59] SteLawBro: Theres only 1 best
[0:41:59] fiestashaman: big dam react
[0:42:07] cyborg1141: One loves you more
[0:42:13] zachgamegodx: umm he had some interesting counter points to the twitter points comments, but agreed on the premise that pvp is too hard to get into
[0:42:14] chronicfuels: cyborg says no, make ur phone calls
[0:42:16] bobby27444: play preservation
[0:42:26] cyborg1141: BibleThump

[0:42:56] bordan1337: Hey,  I just got to level 70 and I feel a bit overwhelmed with what to start with to get into some solo shuffles
[0:43:15] fiestashaman: I sub for the year if the MIESTRO best pally in the game carries you
[0:43:38] thejmdabbler: u qd as dps
[0:43:49] zachgamegodx: nah think he can be observed from afar, but playing with him is not good
[0:43:54] dolanknoob: He's funny but his spam reporting of people for no reason pisses me off
[0:44:11] disar27: !server
[0:44:12] Nightbot: Venruki plays retail on Tichondrius Horde, Faerlina Horde classic, and Crusader Strike Horde for SoD! POGGERS
[0:44:20] crymorre: @zachgamegodx like a zoo, i'll look at the tigers but i don't want to play in the enclosure
[0:44:21] dolanknoob: blizz report system is dogshit and automated, and GMs never read appeals
[0:44:28] zachgamegodx: he also says hpal is the worst healer of all time
[0:44:37] ezmoney3434: what’s your stats for fisty
[0:44:40] cyborg1141: Chat gpt gives an interesting answer
[0:44:42] gelens1: yooooooooo
[0:44:57] soothingmistmonk: I swear him and Metaphores are from the same gene pool.  Meta was going smooth off on Envyion and some warrior last night.  Like smooth off
[0:44:58] demololtv: i made a premade
[0:44:59] zachgamegodx: it is true that avenging wrath is basically not a cd
[0:45:04] fiestashaman: it is worst blizzard does it to sabotage MIESTRO but never give up
[0:45:08] zachgamegodx: but then he says flash of light heals for notihng
[0:45:08] slacker0420: 4 melee feels really good as punchmonk
[0:45:11] gelens1: im doing good how about yourself bro
[0:45:18] eff_xp: Henlo yall
[0:45:25] Badasti: I find most of the people reporting are just as toxic as the people they are reporting LUL
[0:45:30] wreklol: am i crazy? wasn't metaphors bludru?
[0:45:39] ezmoney3434: no mastery for fisting? I swear I seen some of the top guys with like 30% mastery 30 vers and 30 haste
[0:45:48] Cocoapuffs1: they where tryin to tell him how to play or something along those lines
[0:45:49] crymorre: GreenGary

[0:45:57] blorange36: @venruki how did the rest of the aug games go yesterday?
[0:46:02] soothingmistmonk: Because Envyion made a comment about his healing rotation it wasn't mean or anything.  But it was cause this war was messaging him
[0:46:22] ezmoney3434: okay thanks
[0:46:32] fearsii: morning sexy lizard wizard
[0:46:45] zachgamegodx: metaphors isn't at all like crusader, he doesn't talk any shit when he qs people who he thinks are on equal level, just a bit toxic when he "helps" ppl below him

[0:49:14] phanabananana: Twitch :/
[0:49:16] SlyMooseMan: gotta add the nice tax i guess
[0:49:28] MaximumnNeo: Lot of these companies like netflix and other sub services test price increases in Canada,  Australia etc because we have simila rbuying habits as the US
[0:49:32] demololtv: amons zackrawr channel making twitch broke lmao
[0:49:32] Evoca85: Canada is far from 3rd world. Go to a 3rd world before saying something like that.
[0:49:37] MaximumnNeo: so they are checking to see if the US will stomach a price in crease
[0:49:37] Koraszdormu: What's good, Ven.  How you doing today, brother?

[0:51:04] SteLawBro: My sub was free because i used TWITCH PRIME!! Reminder, if you have twitch prime you get one month sub to any of your favorite streamers for NOTHING!
[0:51:06] crymorre: ya so they are pocketing an extra dollar EZ ez money
[0:51:06] MaximumnNeo: i fully expect this is just a price increase trial that they are doing in Canada to see if people will still buy it. They will do a US one too if it works out. Kind of like how Netflix launched ads in Canada before the US
[0:51:21] Tragictomb: US sub price isn’t 4.99, that’s why it’s changing
[0:51:22] Luigicamp: `^

[0:52:32] crymorre: mobile is always more expensive because apple/google stores take a cut so they increase the price

[1:21:09] FergaVee: those fluff one shots
[1:21:13] Hobblefoot: Last night CDEW made a point I have heard many times before.  Just buff the classes that are obviously lagging behind. Don't nerf stuff, buff the "trash" specs so the META can be tweaked a bit.
[1:21:14] koonakeenay: doing the most damage and being targeted the least is an interesting feeling
[1:21:25] gdodmebxu: @fiestashaman sad and true for illidan BibleThump

[1:23:29] lasergazer3: 3k %
[1:23:35] Hobblefoot: @Badasti It doesn't make sense to say a 'dozen' specs when I am talking about maybe 2 or 3 specs.  And I need to emphasize that in my brain, I want small changes. I think small changes will make a world of difference to a few specs.  If that is wrong, I don't want to be right.
[1:23:42] Badasti: @TheNutcracka doesnt change my point though
[1:23:50] Krayik: Dev likes haste. They run to 20% then mastery right now for the current suggested build.
[1:23:55] Cocoapuffs1: i swear tank dh is op
[1:24:11] Cocoapuffs1: with high dam partner its crazy with how much cc they have
[1:24:18] Spaceberry_McDuck: they have massive issues with inflation in Argentina. They can't pay in pesos anymore because it's so volatile, so they have to pay in USD. So it's gonna be like 1/5 of the monthly income to play WoW for Argentinians
[1:24:21] Badasti: @Hobblefoot there's dozens of specs that cant compete with classes like dh, which ones would you pick to buff then LUL
[1:24:50] TheNutcracka: oh, then i missunderstood nvm
[1:25:00] Krayik: I ran pure haste on dev this season since it lets you play all three specs. Ran to 2100 for enchant with ease. It's less damage in dragonrage but faster dreamwalks and disint ticks.
[1:25:01] lasergazer3: In argentina the sub fee is going from 650 ARS to 12.000 ARS monthly
[1:25:11] ATHLTE: the shadow of the wind..
[1:25:14] driftwood_tc: many eastern EU countries have the same issue, lots of my btag buddies from there has to buy game time with ingame gold, since 12 euro is a lot there.
[1:25:32] ATHLTE: rukiGrin
[1:25:36] Spaceberry_McDuck: Ya, things are fucky down there. I'm gonna end up paying for subs for an Argentinian friend or two. It's peanuts for me to pay it.
[1:25:58] hobk1204: london
[1:25:58] driftwood_tc: Copenhagen?
[1:26:00] zerx_gg: Paris is disgusting
[1:26:04] fleet21_: im in london
[1:26:06] theodeth: Not really
[1:26:13] zerx_gg: yes very much
[1:26:15] Necrolancer47: its expensive ya, my sister is there all the time
[1:26:26] Badasti: Thesia is from Paris I think, seems like such a nice dude
[1:26:28] Koraszdormu: IT'S THE HEAT OF THE MOOOMENT
[1:26:28] Flao_1: moscow :D
[1:26:32] hobk1204: what was the question?
[1:26:43] zerx_gg: spent 3 days in london, -800€ xdd
[1:26:47] fleet21_: london is so expensive
[1:26:51] cadillacseville: asia is such a sleeper band. their first two albums rip.
[1:26:52] hobk1204: Paris is disgusting i agree, lived there for a year
[1:26:55] Hobblefoot: @Badasti Me ... Keep in mind I am pretty uneducated about this sort of thing.  But lets say Survival Hunter.  Maybe at small buff to their defense. Nothing crazy obviously.  Maybe adjustments to Frost DK to changing things up a hair. More consistent damage perhaps.  Ass Rogue (the smallest amount though. Lets not have all rogues be OP) .... But that is off the top of my head based on alts I play.
[1:26:57] Necrolancer47: bro just move to the best state in the world TEXAS get u some land
[1:27:04] driftwood_tc: Denmark... yep seems right LUL
[1:27:05] hobk1204: i can 100% tell you London is more expensive than switzerland
[1:27:11] cashewdad: Switzerland looks in line with Toronto
[1:27:11] hobk1204: as a swiss person in London
[1:27:21] Hobblefoot: @Necrolancer47 Not going to lie. My friends did this and never looked back.
[1:27:27] fleet21_: @hobk1204 UK is more expensive bc wages are lower i guess
[1:27:43] balistikk64: @venruki have you dabbled into other games or only wow?
[1:27:54] driftwood_tc: KKona hell yeah brother
[1:27:58] hobk1204: no no, the cost of a good 2 bed in london is about 3-4k GBP, its like 2k max in switzerland
[1:28:01] Spaceberry_McDuck: Texas, with it's high property taxes to make up for their lack of an income tax.
[1:28:03] MaximumnNeo: honestly i looked at texas real estate yesterday and you can get a 2700sq ft house on 5 acres for 600k lol
[1:28:06] MaximumnNeo: it was in small towns, but still
[1:28:07] cashewdad: NB and NS are the new Ab
[1:28:08] Rafheeki: lol im in B.C its fucked
[1:28:21] Necrolancer47: it depends on the city
[1:28:25] StromicusRex: texas is still relatively cheap compared to a lot of other places
[1:28:29] cashewdad: everyone saying move out east now if you want to get a decent house and low cost of living
[1:28:30] StromicusRex: but yeah, depends on where. texas is big
[1:28:32] Pingabreath: NS has high taxes tho
[1:28:38] Krayik: That's why you live in KS. All 9 people in the state agreed to keep costs of living low
[1:28:44] zerx_gg: texas is for nerds
[1:28:49] fleet21_: @hobk1204 I found eating at restuarants in zurich eye wateringly expensive, guess rent is lower
[1:28:50] StromicusRex: it sure don't feel cheap where i am >:(
[1:29:02] cashewdad: Go to st johns and be 30 minutes fucking ahead of everyone else lmao
[1:29:05] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Prplneon WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:29:06] ATHLTE: i was in whitehorse couple years ago and it was expensive lol
[1:29:12] driftwood_tc: Living it up like Trailer park boys
[1:29:30] fleet21_: life in general is expensive everywhere Pog
[1:29:32] driftwood_tc: lol
[1:29:36] zerx_gg: you friccin MORONHEAD
[1:29:36] Necrolancer47: there are Chinese billionairs buying up Texas land right now. mostly central texas
[1:29:41] Badasti: @Hobblefoot I don't mean to sound all negative but lets say SV Hunters, Frost DK's and Assassination rogues are buffed as you say to compete with DH. What about the other 20+ specs? Do they just get absolutely smashed by those specs?
[1:29:57] cashewdad: I am in Toronto now but I wanna move to like northern butt frick no where BC. Tumblers Ridge BC looks SICK. Can buy a 2 bedroom condo for 50k that wasn't build 100 years ago.
[1:30:06] Koraszdormu: Jellybelly decide what he wants to play?
[1:30:07] drfeltgood: Morning Ven
[1:30:10] Krayik: I'd love to see the difference for dev if they just had 40 yard range.
[1:30:13] Hobblefoot: Yes!
[1:30:19] zerx_gg: glacial needs to hit 500k every single time
[1:30:20] MaximumnNeo: i just want a 40 acre ranch, within an hour drive of the city
[1:30:21] driftwood_tc: lets talk about feral... that shit needs fixing.
[1:30:21] zerx_gg: fr fr
[1:30:23] palawakeup: whats the top comp for ww atm?
[1:30:25] palawakeup: warlock ww?
[1:30:32] cashewdad: I saw a  24 acre plot of land out there on realtor for like 107k? Zero utilities tho.
[1:30:34] fistweaveurnan: How about we dont try to buff 20 other specs and just nerf the 3 outliers lmao
[1:30:45] BanthaBantha: rework aff or riot
[1:31:00] cashewdad: I mean, if something to do means like going out clubbing then ya but its right north on the rockies if you like hikes and whatnot.
[1:31:01] MaximumnNeo: yeah thats always the give up of small town living
[1:31:02] lasergazer3: How's augmentation feeling in arena?
[1:31:10] palawakeup: @fistweaveurnan nah its better to buff things than to nerf
[1:31:18] cashewdad: I bet theres some banger restaurants out there cause the produce is so fresh
[1:31:18] driftwood_tc: D: no DH lobby
[1:31:19] Pingabreath: hey Ven were there changes today?
[1:31:23] MaximumnNeo: small towns have notorious awful food lol
[1:31:26] palawakeup: it sucks having your class nerfed just make all classes good nerfs suck
[1:31:31] ATHLTE: oh wait thats sod
[1:31:41] Pingabreath: great
[1:31:42] jdcraces: #nochanges
[1:31:45] cashewdad: You're right tho I am guessing you're in calgary or edmonton, so many great restaurants
[1:31:45] LK1409: Hi Ven, I reroll spriest from mage, do you know any good spriest that do guides etc for PvP?
[1:31:47] ATHLTE: Kappa Kappa
[1:31:55] ATHLTE: bruh i actually cant believe theres no changes
[1:32:02] LK1409: Hi Ven, how do you reckon they will solve the solo shuffle queues, by makign healers more fun to play?
[1:32:02] Moobot: Latest video "Retail PvP Is Plagued With Problems Right Now… And Players Are Not Happy" view it here: youtu.be/sTd8uoLysI4
[1:32:04] cashewdad: where as in tumblers ridge you gotta drive 15 mins to dawsons creek lmao - I am sure there is a couple of great spots there tho
[1:32:29] StromicusRex: food selection is the only thing Houston has going for it, i'm gonna miss it when i'm finally gone
[1:32:58] cashewdad: I feel like Calgary is such a cool spot. You got the stampede, it's not as far north as Edmonton, not too far from Banff if you wanna get away.
[1:33:14] cashewdad: Toronto is also amazing for food but like, obviously
[1:33:16] Koraszdormu: 1% wall.  You love to see it.
[1:33:18] Hobblefoot: @Badasti See it is tricky right. Because the issue for me is I play way too much.  I have alts on virtually every class and I don't so I don't feel like I see all the smashing from DH. I see them being super challenging to beat, but not unbeatable.  So when I make my personal (again not really an uber expert) assessment, I don't think about leaving the 20 specs behind to get smashed because I feel like I can beat DH on a lot of those with a good partner.  BUT the key here is really simple.
[1:33:34] ukantseeme23: Yoooooooooo whaazz is on and wants to do 3s in NA
[1:33:35] drfeltgood: @LK1409 This guy has pretty  solid guides, they're long but in depth. At least something to get u started. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpIiWB2rd-g
[1:33:40] Badasti: @Hobblefoot I think its easier to just nerf DH's LUL got a shuffle though so have to bow out here
[1:33:53] Hobblefoot: @Badasti I am a casual.  So if all things are considered, my opinion may be wrong when considering all levels of play. I dunno.
[1:34:11] CaranoBlaze: I tried Fistweaving. I hate it though. I hate feeling like a melee dps getting kited while your teammates are dying.
[1:34:13] varok87: LOL my Damage.
[1:34:31] cashewdad: Would you ever consider moving to the US?
[1:34:40] Hobblefoot: @Badasti Yeah but then all the people that love to do mindless damage on their DHs don't get to have fun! And we don't get to tilt them by beating their OP spec. :P
[1:35:18] cashewdad: Anywhere it doesn't snow just sounds great
[1:35:29] Hobblefoot: @Badasti All that said, you are probably right, all things considered. I am weird about nerfing.
[1:35:42] apaine27: You know everyone is complaining about DHs but I see an Arms warrior in every game topping DPS.
[1:35:43] DegStaerian: Bot turned off
[1:35:55] apaine27: and on Drustvar they’re the most played class in SS
[1:35:58] cashewdad: @apaine27 arms just bleeds everything
[1:36:56] Hobblefoot: @apaine27 And I see Ret topping DPS in most of my games.  But even then, you know what I get my ass kicked by in 2s the most.   Balance Druid for some reason. Hahaha.
[1:37:00] fleet21_: new monk jade fire looks sick
[1:37:26] Matzefyr: Didn't  Venruki used to be a mage main? i know you don't get rank 1 by playing weak class, but comeon. what is it with these rank1 players and playing fotm spec every month?
[1:37:28] DoYouWannaHug: Great healing Ven! PogChamp
[1:37:29] pr1me1989: yo ven, whaazz writing to you. he want's to play. he is on NA and needs the gear :D
[1:37:35] Hobblefoot: Oh there is a Caveat.  I HATE  Fistweavers  with a Melee partner.  That is a complete nightmare.
[1:37:37] Cocoapuffs1: lol just stood in 1 spot all game
[1:37:38] DegStaerian: i was just wondering why u would never use FoF rukiEw

[1:38:23] zerx_gg: matzefyr has 3 messages before he gets snipped
[1:38:39] Hobblefoot: Like being terrible at the game I love?  Fair.  :P
[1:39:05] Holtan3111: What situations would you say are challanging as a FistWeaver ?

[1:39:49] StromicusRex: you really do
[1:39:58] pr0x365: Ven with the bangers this morning
[1:40:03] Hobblefoot: @Holtan3111 For me (and I don't want FW gone btw) it is a FW with a Ret Paladin for example or an Arms warrior.  That is super hard.  I mean I love to try beat it but man it is hard.  It is overwhelming.
[1:40:03] StromicusRex: does it count when they're all the same? @zerx_gg
[1:40:10] gator_321: @Holtan3111 teammates not pressing their defensives

[1:49:51] drfeltgood: @moremantella255 I like to go in as battle stance for open burst then swap to D stance
[1:50:06] gdodmebxu: it's good to be swapping based on what's happening
[1:50:14] gdodmebxu: otherwise you do a lot less damage
[1:50:22] moremantella255: @gdodmebxu honestly i feel like id need to be in it most of the game then. i feel squishy as hell even with rally cry and die by sword
[1:50:34] moremantella255: and ignore pain
[1:51:10] gdodmebxu: if you're kill target that's probably fine

[2:51:14] mfushi: the game works but solo shuffle is scuffed
[2:51:17] lasergazer3: Its not a stretch. I have a few Italian friends here in Copenhagen, and they literally do see food and wine as a part of their identity. Therefore saying "need to relax" or "ligten up" is more or less the same as saying stop being you.
[2:51:19] that_man_ski: rukiEw rukiEw
[2:51:21] MaximumnNeo: In my experience the average resteraunt you see in the streets is generally not very good. so id encourage to plan out some meals and do some research
[2:51:24] billscuttlebutt: porchetta
[2:51:29] kusoneko: streamer client also has fast shuffle queues
[2:51:32] Maxdeath1: they needed to kick people off so ven could get his shuffle queues to pop
[2:51:47] NelsonGamingShow: MIESTRO
[2:51:52] zachgamegodx: a lot of hungry ppl here
[2:51:53] ripzaddo: is food is who i am Madge
[2:51:55] fatlittlepaypig: im 300 lbs and i dont even like food that much
[2:51:57] zachgamegodx: we need to be fed
[2:52:01] Chrono_s: LUL
[2:52:03] illEvan11_11: when i went to italy, i had this thing called suppli, its like fried rice balls with a red sauce. They were really good
[2:52:09] zerx_gg: is it important? then why do u call them French Fries
[2:52:11] Smexxin: DansGame
[2:52:15] ATHLTE: anyways
[2:52:16] Blondii3y: Whats the easiest way to gear this late in the season?
[2:52:17] NelsonGamingShow: @ripzaddo sure can i have bite
[2:52:20] kusoneko: getting mad on behalf of OTHER PEOPLES FOOD is where the line should be drawn
[2:52:21] nikthevoker: FREEDOM FRIES
[2:52:22] ATHLTE: Kappa
[2:52:23] MezzioTV: I identify as homemade tomato sauce
[2:52:32] Luigicamp: here is the thing... once a recipe is exported, it will assimilate some of the local flavors. Do you think foreign foods in Italy taste like their country of origins? No!
[2:52:33] Chrono_s: French fries = belgium fries

[2:54:06] MisterThatDude: Fury is fun
[2:54:07] MezzioTV: @fatlittlepaypig because you don't lose your MMR
[2:54:14] chubmax: cuz its smexxin
[2:54:15] fatlittlepaypig: i dont consult with fury warriors
[2:54:17] fatlittlepaypig: theyre all FREAKS
[2:54:17] higanheim: i think he's gonna get clapped with death wish up
[2:54:20] illEvan11_11: they were playing fury/ret/FW monk lol
[2:54:24] zerx_gg: i think smexxin is a god damn liar
[2:54:25] ATHLTE: @notoriousztv watch a guide on ur class and practice ur rotation!!
[2:54:31] hunchurio: cdew beat them every game
[2:54:31] zachgamegodx: why did he swap to arms as the night went on
[2:54:33] leeka: ewww
[2:54:33] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[2:54:36] kusoneko: LITTLE CHEESER
[2:54:37] xvpsp: Venruki what is good with frost mage for 3v3 ?
[2:54:42] What_ln_Tarnation: KEKW
[2:54:50] fatlittlepaypig: arms is the path
[2:54:51] Smexxin: yes
[2:55:01] Chrono_s: sure
[2:55:04] koonakeenay: family meeting immediately
[2:55:07] Smexxin: literally the last game of the night cuz we were 1-6 vs evasion cleave
[2:55:08] No_Claws: Jebaited
[2:55:11] fatlittlepaypig: oh no no no KEKW
[2:55:11] lasergazer3: I'm not getting mad about food at all. I'm just trying to widen the lens a bit. Its just "food for thought" so to speak. If you visit a friend or family member, you wouldn't do anything intentionally hurtful :P
[2:55:12] sharpdressedman15: damn they lost to the top na awc team? noobs
[2:55:31] Smexxin: yessir, dark times
[2:55:31] hunchurio: lol yes
[2:55:37] kusoneko: fix that chest piece, not kawaii at all :3
[2:55:40] What_ln_Tarnation: ngl, happy to see fw/ret/war teams lose
[2:55:42] notoriousztv: they def beat cdew last night
[2:55:45] Adolescents77: smexxin fighting fire with fire
[2:55:45] notoriousztv: once

[2:56:05] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy techxc WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:56:10] zerx_gg: eat truffle mayonaise like a real man
[2:56:11] Rossamenos: if they nerfed DH overall dmg by 50% I'm pretty sure they'd still be good.
[2:56:17] Luigicamp: you do need to go ask for Alfredo sauce though, and video document it, I wanna have a laugh!
[2:56:26] What_ln_Tarnation: DH just need blade dance nerfed
[2:56:31] BossmanRitz: Nothing beats mannacotti
[2:56:31] Luigicamp: that's not the point lol
[2:56:32] cyborg1141: Eat steak with your hands
[2:56:32] No_Claws: D:
[2:56:33] nikthevoker: DH is barely viable
[2:56:33] What_ln_Tarnation: blade dance does too much dam
[2:56:42] ayosteviey: Red sauce gives me heart burn
[2:56:42] sharpdressedman15: i think they need to reduce rsham armor by another 20% this shit is out of control
[2:56:45] cashewdad: do you think warriors would be too OP if sweeping strikes was off the global
[2:56:46] kusoneko: a 10% dps nerf on DH would make it disappear from all games
[2:56:47] zachgamegodx: @rossamenos 50%??!
[2:56:48] fatlittlepaypig: if it aint moo'in i aint chewin brother KKona
[2:56:50] Adolescents77: I hate alfredo sauce too no bueno
[2:56:56] Axtin: sustained
[2:56:57] nicolai0912: Do you think we will be seeing any class changes before the end of the season? or anytime soon?
[2:56:58] No_Claws: Both
[2:57:01] BossmanRitz: Have you ever had manicotti ven?
[2:57:04] domz_i: Yes
[2:57:04] hunchurio: @notoriousztv two games i saw they lost but it was close, also he was playing evoker. definitely was rooting for smex
[2:57:06] Smexxin: sustained for sure
[2:57:07] pr0x365: stats
[2:57:08] asloff: stats
[2:57:12] Lemurion1: i like strenght also for the extra stam
[2:57:20] fatlittlepaypig: sustained is better
[2:57:24] Rossamenos: @zachgamegodx facetiousness
[2:57:43] gritngrind81: cant argue with smex
[2:58:02] Lemurion1: let dh stay as it is Kappa
[2:58:04] FateIRL: theres 0 pvp devs atm the one pvp dev got laid off
[2:58:05] zachgamegodx: @rossamenos it needs some nerfs but mainly to their passive tankiness
[2:58:08] hunchurio: there havent been changes in forever it feels like
[2:58:15] What_ln_Tarnation: all the devs are working on war within atm, so prob no changes
[2:58:23] ItsBees: 10 min :3
[2:58:23] fatlittlepaypig: whenever ppl can log in
[2:58:31] xvpsp: BIG BUFF frost mage could be ic :D
[2:58:33] xvpsp: Nice
[2:58:33] Woodhard: You have a debuff
[2:58:33] jdcraces: war within sod cata
[2:58:35] voiitz: I cant even walk into org in SoD
[2:58:41] cbell86: login seems to be working now
[2:58:48] swollenarmsx: i queued for a 3v3 and only me and 1 from the other team made it in lol
[2:58:54] domz_i: @cbell86 troll
[2:58:54] arcane_p: put power back into ice lance like season 1
[2:58:59] koonakeenay: i think you could buff the spells to do more damage
[2:59:01] hunchurio: damage increase 10% would be nice
[2:59:02] zerx_gg: EU works fine xdd
[2:59:15] klindz: is there something wrong with shuffles right now?
[2:59:15] cbell86: idk I just logged in
[2:59:21] cbell86: wasn't able to for about 45 minutes before
[2:59:22] hunchurio: or 3% like ret got lol
[2:59:22] xvpsp: can you explain what you want for frost mage exactly ?
[2:59:29] arcane_p: Remember in season 1 when it was just drop orb and ice lance spam and it actually moved peoples health
[2:59:30] mnowpsn: 50% Lance dmg
[2:59:40] Smexxin: which spells do you want to do damage
[2:59:53] xvpsp: thanks smexx
[2:59:54] keeirenus: server r taking forever to log in
[2:59:56] Smexxin: what tier is frost getting for next season
[2:59:57] keem33: Whats your favorite thing about dh?
[2:59:57] What_ln_Tarnation: frost mages sub rogues and frost dks are too cancer to also do damage
[3:00:02] arcane_p: a lot plus the hp buffs
[3:00:07] Smexxin: pain
[3:00:08] nicolai0912: Im sure you have answered this already, but why is it harder to climb in 3's with lfg compared to in SL.
[3:00:12] higanheim: ty pve andys
[3:00:16] livelaughlenin: hey
[3:00:32] fatlittlepaypig: i got to character screen!
[3:00:33] kusoneko: let us just chooooose the tier set
[3:00:33] zachgamegodx: as a novice frost mage I feel like I need more dmg on my blizzard and the concentrated coldness talent should increase orb dmg by 70%
[3:00:33] arcane_p: Hp buffs plus the trinket nerfs and the ice lance nerf with no tier set
[3:00:41] What_ln_Tarnation: or ring of frost
[3:00:45] xvpsp: i agree
[3:01:04] kusoneko: dh is fun cuz it always just does damage
[3:01:05] Xeliumimar: I think frost mage should get like a flat 20% haste buff
[3:01:17] arcane_p: I think they should just un nerf ring of fire like it was when they first released it
[3:01:23] Smexxin: dont they already have the highest haste in the game
[3:01:29] fatlittlepaypig: rip now im stuck on load screen
[3:01:34] MezzioTV: nerf glass cannon health % to 0
[3:01:51] xvpsp: weird but i want more value on my blizzard and ice lance
[3:01:55] TrippThree: These damn "Failed Loggin" are annoying!!!
[3:01:57] FateIRL: try to q up your frost mage
[3:02:00] Smexxin: do you enjoy the current blink gameplay of mages? feel like its the one reason i dont wanna try it out
[3:02:00] lasergazer3: So you like Arcane and Fire more than Frost atm?
[3:02:02] What_ln_Tarnation: frost mages have too much anti melee cc, they need to nerf that before buffing their dam
[3:02:07] fatlittlepaypig: im so glad i get to bug test every tuesday for absolutely 0 pay
[3:02:26] Smexxin: just blinks and displacement as being your primary way of avoiding dmg
[3:02:30] What_ln_Tarnation: i look at a frost mage and im perma rooted forever
[3:02:38] zachgamegodx: the only thing that feels powerful on frost is the ray and the frost bomb but if you’re facing an ele shaman and a dh you can’t get shit off
[3:02:38] macdeezyx: this is was happened to my lobby
[3:02:38] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[3:02:40] higanheim: i might be wrong, but i hope they don't buff anything with a cast or channel, just gives more reason to shut down a mage and have to play like a god to get anything off
[3:02:40] zachgamegodx: frustrates. me
[3:02:41] kusoneko: alive game KEKW
[3:02:42] waelrick: LUL
[3:02:44] FateIRL: should stop trying to do shuffle not gonna work
[3:02:46] FateIRL: lol
[3:02:50] zerx_gg: literal solo shuffle xdd
[3:03:03] leeka: alter time, undispellable, lasts 4-5 seconds, fixed
[3:03:05] vishys: happening 2 me too
[3:03:07] Adolescents77: so many people can just dispel it
[3:03:11] Ambersulfr: I don't mind alter until it's on arcane
[3:03:15] fatlittlepaypig: it says world server is down when i try to log in after load screen, so shuffle def isnt working
[3:03:18] illEvan11_11: idt it needs to be nerfed based on it being easily purged
[3:03:18] Snypes_SYCO: @leeka I would take that
[3:03:23] Tony1973: What about ring of fire > Fire only, Ring of Frost > Frost only > and arcane can have either arcane imprison or arane teleport to teleport your target somewhere on the map
[3:03:31] emergencxyz: WTB abillity to log in and farm glad wins
[3:03:39] arcane_p: alter time falls into that statement you made about nerfing things in a vacuum, if you nerf it now mage would absolutly be trash
[3:03:48] cbell86: wtf there's gear with spirit now?
[3:03:48] apaine27: When could you show me your big debuff priority?
[3:04:00] apaine27: Ven*
[3:04:02] nutz_hang_uneven: they should add arcane ring, where after you drop it down it just ends the match
[3:04:03] Badasti: i just want them to lower mobility and let us cast again
[3:04:05] Badasti: i want to casrt
[3:04:05] TrippThree: OMG I just wanna login...lol
[3:04:16] Rossamenos: do you like that yellow set over the pink 1800 set?
[3:04:20] zachgamegodx: arcanosphere is the arcane one
[3:04:37] joyrex_j9: the raidfinder recolor for the monk set is nice
[3:04:40] Pingabreath: is the game fked rn?

[3:05:48] Locturnal_TV: have you seen starship troopers?
[3:05:48] Von_Liechtenstein: Top down game
[3:05:52] heymomimonttv: helldivers 2 is the same thing where you're gonna sit in a log in queue. some streamers have to wait upwards of an hour to log in
[3:06:04] DoYouWannaHug: This game did Starship troopers better than Starship troopers
[3:06:16] Adolescents77: I still have helldivers on my psvita

[3:07:07] primejusticegaming: i havent found any info on it, but its achievement is similar to like glad
[3:07:12] FateIRL: -150?
[3:07:15] Sheepyou: would be fun if someones hacks blizzard and deletes all WoW files LUL
[3:07:17] Badasti: man i was in love with that actress on starship troopers when i was a kid
[3:07:18] StromicusRex: @Rossamenos the one of the floor is a painting his grandma did, above it is a photo he took, the leafy one behind him is a photo reckful took. i'm not 100% sure about the others
[3:07:18] waitimdesyncd: was that -150?

[3:28:37] Mhortai: What are we reacting to that needs so much reaction? lol
[3:28:47] emergencxyz: Ven I found something that beats DH ELE
[3:28:48] NovaSun84: zoom, enhance, zoom, enhance.  zoewreDealWithIt
[3:28:50] Badasti: god Asmongold, i just want to tape his eyebrows down so he stops twitching them

[3:29:39] figurines: im in a 2s match and both the dps didnt load in
[3:29:41] Badasti: that carbot cartoon of Chris Metzen was hilarious

[3:30:23] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: talking about mages in pvp
[3:30:33] twinkieruler95: its asmongold
[3:30:34] FateIRL: because bellular is clickbait
[3:30:36] fatlittlepaypig: because he makes money off of being cynical
[3:30:43] okcoolstory: asmongold is just a classic andy
[3:30:46] KrimzinGames: because asmon is trying to stay relevant
[3:30:48] NelsonGamingShow: baldmongold doesnt play
[3:30:48] fatlittlepaypig: he just plays anime games now hes weird
[3:30:50] Mhortai: I mean, Asmongold's whole thing is shitting on retail WoW now days pretty much lol.
[3:30:51] Kymagez: bad player no addons :)
[3:30:52] Snypes_SYCO: Asmond said it's dead, because no new players will join due to seeing all the good players with all these addons.
[3:30:54] Badasti: I like Supa's piece of art
[3:30:54] andreaued: !talents
[3:30:54] Nightbot: Here is a list of all the different talent builds I use: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[3:31:03] lolmangodx: cuz wow playerbase is old
[3:31:17] subtlety59: i've been hearing wow is dead since vanilla
[3:31:21] moremantella255: chat whos the two bald guys?
[3:31:24] Snypes_SYCO: People watch streamers to get better ideas how to play, but see all this information on the screen, andto learn it as a noob is rough.
[3:31:33] TrippThree: Shadow Pan is from JACK BLACK!!!
[3:31:47] Zlipps: I think blizz just asked ChatGPT to name some new classes
[3:31:54] maenkins: is this a react of a react of a react?
[3:31:57] NovaSun84: oh question:  Where is the Blizzard War Within video?
[3:31:59] Badasti: huh... will we still be able to play vanilla frost or we gotta pick one of these uber specs?
[3:32:09] NovaSun84: Can we get that, or are we too far into the reaction content for OG justinegRofl
[3:32:10] Mhortai: These names can change they already said that. SO GIVE FEEDBACK PEOPLE!
[3:32:15] What_ln_Tarnation: clickbait title
[3:32:17] Smexxin: wait how many reacts are there happening right now
[3:32:17] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Rider of the Apocalypse in may favorite one

[3:33:03] Ignite_CLO: reaction meta in full effect
[3:33:04] Zuterloo: fucking inception
[3:33:05] moremantella255: Listening

[3:33:37] NovaSun84: stewsNotes True Supa
[3:33:40] absterge: holy fuck dude the war within is so dead
[3:33:41] moremantella255: Watching
[3:33:41] Ultramagnus85: new extra talent trees for next xpac, they look just like soul binds
[3:33:41] absterge: seriously?
[3:33:45] obstata: look at the frame he froze asmon on lol
[3:33:55] hunchurio: lol
[3:33:56] NovaSun84: absterge thenat30CharloWow Saving Retail 1 heal at a time.
[3:34:01] Badasti: its like they are having a real convo, Supa stops talking at the perfect times to let Ven get a word in
[3:34:11] NovaSun84: Kreygasm
[3:34:12] ripzaddo: gachiGASM
[3:34:16] NovaSun84: he's doing the emote
[3:34:18] polarityshifter: pingas
[3:34:23] ItsBees: Kreygasm
[3:34:24] tformerz: think they just want it to be good. better start talking pros and cons
[3:34:25] zerx_gg: is this a bait Badasti
[3:34:27] Mhortai: @absterge I mean all of Amsongold's YouTube titles are just like that at this point. Super click baity
[3:34:28] Axtin: the goal is to make the reaction inception deep enough that the whole screen is only webcams
[3:34:28] rohmantv: watching ven react to supatease reacting to asmons reaction to belluars vid, lol
[3:34:32] absterge: wonder why wow is hated by so many even before an expansion comes out (maybe has something to do with content creators making videos saying the game is dead b4 we even have an alpha)
[3:34:34] absterge: LMFAOOOO
[3:34:44] Badasti: @zerx_gg 100% serious ofc LUL
[3:34:52] zerx_gg: xdd
[3:34:56] blorange36: bunch of doomers tbh
[3:34:59] absterge: yeah dude wow
[3:34:59] What_ln_Tarnation: its a 100000000% clickbait title tho
[3:35:01] absterge: lets do this!!!
[3:35:02] kusoneko: :D
[3:35:03] What_ln_Tarnation: they farming views
[3:35:06] Ignite_CLO: this is asmongolds whole personality now
[3:35:11] NovaSun84: OMEGAPOGGERS what a hero
[3:35:14] zerx_gg: are u gonna react to the video absterge
[3:35:19] Pingabreath: whats ur take on addons?
[3:35:19] kusoneko: negative videos always get more views, thats just how it is
[3:35:20] tformerz: ''dead'' clickbait
[3:35:22] absterge: yes @zerx_gg I will react to venrki's video
[3:35:26] zerx_gg: chad
[3:35:26] dailyshuffle: yea they literally farming views
[3:35:28] supatease: im reacting to vens reaction of my reaction to a reaction
[3:35:28] FateIRL: asmongold doesnt play wow
[3:35:28] zerx_gg: venrki
[3:35:30] FateIRL: lol
[3:35:31] joyrex_j9: clip this so supa can react to your reaction please
[3:35:39] Vautry: how many react videos deep are we?
[3:35:42] Zanpander00: its way too dank
[3:35:50] Mhortai: Gone to far is a super good answer.
[3:35:52] Badasti: addons shouldnt give a direct competitive advantage, they should purely be qualtiy of life, like bartender and stuff, rearranging the UI etc
[3:35:54] Pingabreath: I think mop was fine with addons from what I remember
[3:35:56] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: NOT IN PVE ofc
[3:35:58] lumaday: @supatease lol
[3:36:02] tformerz: i hate the addosn
[3:36:02] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: we donjt talk about PVE here
[3:36:11] Hobblefoot: @absterge YES!!! Thank you.  The "Group Think" that influential people like Asmod and Bellular have can really be destructive.
[3:36:14] NightMunchies: pve is for the weak
[3:36:18] lumaday: i like aesthetic improving addons
[3:36:21] yethz: the base experiance is shit
[3:36:21] Ignite_CLO: they dont love them either but if they are available they gotta use them
[3:36:25] NightMunchies: anyone can pve
[3:36:27] Smexxin: if the purpose of these videos is to give feedback, why are people so eager to exaggerate points instead of just staying within fact territory. its so much easier understanding information when you dont have to decipher it
[3:36:28] zerx_gg: FirstTimeChatter
[3:36:31] ChronicSlowplay: 100
[3:36:38] Kymagez: very
[3:36:38] polarityshifter: Its a barrier for new players
[3:36:39] StromicusRex: toxic mod
[3:36:41] blorange36: constant tug and pull between devs and players making addons
[3:36:41] TrippThree: Suppa is reacting to you reacting to him
[3:36:42] Badasti: bro I'd even get rid of quest markets in the minimap and force people to read quests again or tab to wowhead again LUL
[3:36:43] Snypes_SYCO: Pve addons tell you when you move out of the fire.  It's all artificial skill
[3:36:46] ItsBees: Kymmmmm rukiLove
[3:36:46] NightMunchies: not everone is good @ pvp
[3:36:48] Hark0n: when in built details blizzard
[3:36:48] ChronicSlowplay: theyve done a good job at integrating alot, but i 100 percent agree with you
[3:36:50] TrippThree: Suppa is reacting to you... now...lol
[3:36:52] goatskull123: You basically NEEED weak auras to do mythic raiding right now
[3:36:52] zerx_gg: hell yeah brotherman toxic as fuck
[3:36:55] m1keyc: can anyone login?
[3:36:55] amkttv: Addons are like steroids... If you try to compete without them, you're fucked.
[3:36:56] goatskull123: And you need a TON of them
[3:36:57] NovaSun84: plus, it's impossible to watch as a newer viewer.  The UI makes 0 sense.
[3:36:58] heymomimonttv: how do you get the toothpaste back into the tube?
[3:37:03] jamesip87: delete them all off the game and make it clean
[3:37:04] Kymagez: BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS rukiLove
[3:37:04] NightMunchies: i love add ons
[3:37:06] goatskull123: I spent 20 minutes downloadign weak auras last week
[3:37:08] What_ln_Tarnation: moran
[3:37:14] lightsflux: @m1keyc servers are trash right now
[3:37:17] NightMunchies: without em im fked
[3:37:24] lolmangodx: i dont even have omnibar as caster, maybe at top its critical
[3:37:29] Mhortai: @Smexxin They aren't for feedback anymore honestly. It's for views. Period. Even if there may be good feedback in these videos it's overshadowed by the need for views.
[3:37:34] bawscal: clean
[3:37:37] tformerz: miss it
[3:37:38] nutz_hang_uneven: you dont even need to be good at the game anymore all you need is to know how to download add ons
[3:37:42] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121622 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_venruki #ad
[3:37:43] piggiepie: I dont understand why so many people RUSH to content: faster dungeons, faster dragons, faster raids, pvp fast, we forgot to enjoy the game
[3:37:44] notoriousztv: is that reckful on rogue
[3:37:49] Mhortai: @nutz_hang_uneven I mean wrong lol
[3:37:50] Hark0n: NEED DAMAGE METER TBH.
[3:37:53] Smexxin: yeah feels like that now @Mhortai
[3:37:55] What_ln_Tarnation: this is why he lost awc, not enough addon info
[3:37:55] NightMunchies: details
[3:38:07] TrippThree: SUPPA IS REACTING TO YOU NOW!!!!!
[3:38:10] What_ln_Tarnation: this is why chaniboy best lock in game
[3:38:16] Snypes_SYCO: Blizz should ban addons for 1 month.  I'd like to see how people play without them.  The real pro players will still be good.. they are pros for a reason, but the better than avg will drop a bit, and the bad will raise a bit.
[3:38:21] Badasti: that shaman where you cant even see his character LUL
[3:38:22] Hobblefoot: @piggiepie Truth. This is part of why Classic and SoD are fun for  many people (not me ... but many)
[3:38:24] lightsflux: yeah i was about to say thats pretty tame for nowadays
[3:38:26] willie_stroker_99: Check Sdew
[3:38:29] goatskull123: check Tyga's UI
[3:38:30] notoriousztv: cdews is crazy
[3:38:40] Mhortai: @Smexxin Bellular talked about his videos getting less views when he was doing mostly positive feedback at the start of DF, then he started posting click bait title videos again and his views went up.
[3:38:41] DJ_HappyDays: just got here not sure if you showed it but CDEW UI is a lot
[3:38:58] Badasti: "your healer is in cc now beep boop bop bop"
[3:38:59] Kymagez: but im old n def :(
[3:39:02] tformerz: haha true
[3:39:02] maenkins: then there are people who pay for another player's ui/addons
[3:39:06] What_ln_Tarnation: i still use gladiatorlosa Sadge
[3:39:08] KrimzinGames: mes ui is literally cancer
[3:39:14] Zanpander00: adhd simulator
[3:39:16] methudz: My friend always tells me to use it, but I prefer trying to be good at the game lol
[3:39:26] kusoneko: lmaooo the global trackers on the nameplates
[3:39:28] Mhortai: Gladiatorlosa makes makes me not want to watch streamers that use it @venruki
[3:39:32] five_moke: I hate the fact addons are in pvp
[3:39:35] tformerz: this is why i dont que anymore just boring. every game feels the same
[3:39:35] Kymagez: <
[3:39:36] DJ_HappyDays: tea global tracker - its a weak aura
[3:39:37] TheNutcracka: on the left on chanimals nameplates you can see the globals
[3:39:45] fatlittlepaypig: omnicd is enough info imo
[3:39:49] TheNutcracka: the shaman just used ghostwoilf
[3:39:50] NovaSun84: lizzNODDERS
[3:39:51] piggiepie: True
[3:39:55] nutz_hang_uneven: bro these ui's look like barf
[3:39:56] kritikos5: I use 0 addons, not even a dps meter. I'm pretty hardstuck 2.1k.  Anything past that is too sweaty w/o addons
[3:39:56] Hobblefoot: @venruki My question is how the hell players CAN use all that.  If I had all that there is no way I could focus on all of that and what is happening in the actual gameplay.
[3:39:58] blorange36: youre one of the only pvpers i can watch bc your screen isnt chaos
[3:39:59] ieatpieasudie: it's so difficult to tell what's going on
[3:40:01] waelrick: weak auras in retail mythic raiding are wild
[3:40:02] NightMunchies: every game i play is never the same
[3:40:02] amkttv: for sure overdone UIs are cancer
[3:40:07] Kymagez: no addons wa's or macros im struggling to get 1600 :(
[3:40:11] NovaSun84: Can't get League of Legends numbers when everyone has no clue what to pay attention to.
[3:40:19] tformerz: can u turn up supa?
[3:40:20] TrippThree: SUPPA IS REACTING TO YOU REACTING TO HIM!!! LOL
[3:40:27] buzswagyo: why cant i log in
[3:40:30] ImShmoly: just got gladiatorlosa and only enabled some big CDs to be called out cause you have to react so fast as healer
[3:40:33] tformerz: ty
[3:40:42] Hobblefoot: This is a interesting analogy actually coming up
[3:40:44] NovaSun84: kk, 5 pound dumb bells.
[3:40:49] Badasti: when I do shuffle I always have 2 dumbells on my team
[3:41:01] NightMunchies: same
[3:41:06] Smexxin: everyone tryna be jacked and i just wanna lift 5 lb dumbbells BibleThump
[3:41:07] zerx_gg: xdd
[3:41:13] Kymagez: so now i have to work out aswell ...
[3:41:15] Kymagez: jeez
[3:41:19] ItsBees: um they start at 2, gawd supa
[3:41:38] NovaSun84: brb lifting some weights.  Good call
[3:41:38] Badasti: I always have to carry 2 dumbells to victory
[3:41:38] xilyx2: on the tik tok
[3:41:43] NightMunchies: every dumbbell i play with dies 30secs or less
[3:41:43] Badasti: im so confused by this analogy btw
[3:41:44] zerx_gg: on the tik tok is WILD
[3:41:48] Kymagez: i feel attacked
[3:41:51] figurines: I had kick macro'd to bloodthirst that was macro'd with ignore pain. can't imagine being a beginner and doing that today
[3:41:59] TrippThree: SUPPA IS WATCHING YOU REACT TO HIM...LOL
[3:41:59] tformerz: on the tik tok lul
[3:41:59] nikthevoker: just working out like crusader
[3:42:04] piffzorz: @Smexxin shrimp
[3:42:12] BigHawkWoW: Crusader has best form usa
[3:42:17] Badasti: damn supa got crazy eyes
[3:42:19] Badasti: in this pause
[3:42:23] Schwenkyytv: friends are hard to find
[3:42:28] Kymagez: lol the pause
[3:42:34] TheSimulant: friends lol
[3:42:34] goatskull123: It's not the same I think
[3:42:46] NovaSun84: LoL is my measurement.  It's a flat UI, and the skill comes in the gameplay
[3:42:58] goatskull123: new players can't pay attention to that
[3:42:59] Ignite_CLO: smexxin went from giga chad warrior main that dead lifts 800lbs to 5lb dumbbell shadow priest andy FeelsBadMan
[3:43:02] Hobblefoot: You are not at a disadvantage 'overall'  ....  Not at all.  Until higher levels of end game.
[3:43:07] BossmanRitz: The game is too handicapped with add ons. I feel like any addon that makes the game WAY easier like WA should be considered cheating
[3:43:10] superchargedd: lol also has UI mods with overwolf
[3:43:12] NovaSun84: 💯 maphack
[3:43:16] SteLawBro: Its not fun to log into a game for the first time knowing youre going to need a bachelors and 3 years experience before you can even try to compete.
[3:43:17] PagsGT: It's like baseball players that use steroids vs. those that don't
[3:43:17] superchargedd: they track summoners and camp spawn timers
[3:43:19] Ultramagnus85: maybe the equivelant of having a map
[3:43:21] Badasti: the final version of this react to a react to a react going to be the lord of the rings trilogy
[3:43:23] Ultramagnus85: not map hack
[3:43:49] goatskull123: as far as pvp goes, I highly doubt you need any addos before 1800 rating
[3:43:50] BossmanRitz: Some people dont want to use addons. Makes people feel like its a form of cheating/handicapped playstyle
[3:43:58] willie_stroker_99: I've done m+ dungeons with ppl never done pvp and there is a big skill gap for them
[3:44:02] Kleenextv: bigdebuffs
[3:44:05] Badasti: I dont know why they made the edit ui the way they did, all they needed to do was build bartender into the game
[3:44:06] What_ln_Tarnation: bigdebuffs is goat
[3:44:13] PhDickens: the fact that some of the things you're talking about AREN"T included in base UI means a lot of people aren't even aware that it's a game mechanic that exists.
[3:44:24] Kymagez: exactly
[3:44:29] kingmaxipoo: you used to not be able to see CC timers on yourself, you needed lose control :D
[3:44:30] NovaSun84: justinegRofl what is that actually
[3:44:30] Hevoftw: bonus rep buff Pog
[3:44:32] allen_the_average_old_joe: Supa is watching Ven watch supas video reacting to him watching Asmons video reacting to watching...
[3:44:46] Hobblefoot: You can make it from Level 1 to Level 70 ......... AND complete the raids (LFR and Normal), complete the dungeons (Normal, Heroic, M0) and do BGs, Skirms, and World PVP with no addons at all and have fun.  The problem is that all of us are so 'in the system' we don't see that perspective anymore.
[3:44:47] PhDickens: I started playing threes with a friend that hadn't played before, and i was trying to explain pvp DRs and trinket tracking to him and he had no idea it even existed.
[3:44:48] jayhovito: I play with minimal add ons and play at 2k cr in shuffle and I know that if I tracked more things I would be higher cr and thats what feels bad about the game for me
[3:44:54] FateIRL: i think servers are up
[3:44:55] sukoWoW: Jak is doing a no-addon rdruid right now and thats a big problem of his, not being able to track/not-track certain things
[3:45:13] BossmanRitz: The game should be hard though
[3:45:13] aaggros: I have never liked that an addon like gladlosa exists.
[3:45:18] nutz_hang_uneven: this game would benefit from a huge purge again, when they did it in legion everyone hated it but still it made the game more simple
[3:45:20] theodeth: For his analogy, add-ons we are like steroids
[3:45:30] BossmanRitz: Especially to determine who is actualy the best at the game. Higher skilled players
[3:45:30] goatskull123: 100% agree with Supa here
[3:45:31] Badasti: create a separate ladder for people who have addons disabled
[3:45:42] Lordshaftington: bro new players don't even know add-ons exist. They don't even know what they don't know.
[3:45:54] zen_oni_shinobi: i would rebuttle that keystone level 30 isn't keystone level 30 when played with so many wa and addons they'res too much info coming in.
[3:45:56] seaent: can we get working servers too
[3:45:56] mknight1234: is it not crazy to anyone else that gladius/sarena have been used since TBC and is still the only way to see DR trackers and info like that? how is this stuff not baked into the game yet by default
[3:46:00] BossmanRitz: It should be hard to spot a buff/debuff. Part of being aware. having a WA just is weak imo
[3:46:08] kingmaxipoo: pikaboo doesnt play with a lot of addons
[3:46:11] Saitistreamy: Zero to Hero NO ADD ONs lol
[3:46:14] Saitistreamy: lets go
[3:46:18] zen_oni_shinobi: at that point the player has intentionally lowered the difficulty with outside source.
[3:46:27] varok87: Crusader UI LUL
[3:46:28] Badasti: Pikabro is a leg, its insane that he plays that well with his UI
[3:46:33] maenkins: pika the best player then??? monkaEyes
[3:46:42] Hobblefoot: But Asmond is missing perspective.  If I am a new player I am not even aware of all this end game min/maxing.  Think of the game from that perspective.  Then it is just a fun game with a tutorial even.
[3:46:44] Mhortai: @venruki I am of the opinion especially there seems to be an issue from some WOW content creators to over react to everything because it's good for numbers. Hero Talents aren't close to being in the final stage.
[3:46:44] maenkins: KEKW
[3:46:44] ItsBees: Prewatched Pog
[3:46:55] NovaSun84: If people spam Weak Aura packs at me in Classic WoW when they fuck up the core mechanics... We've gone too far, wait that happened in MC
[3:46:57] sukoWoW: pikaboo has also played the game for over a decade
[3:47:03] Blaxter2243: Blaxter2243 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! rukiGrin
[3:47:05] illEvan11_11: pikaboo might be the actual goat of wow
[3:47:11] subtlety59: @venruki You think your rating would drop 300 or lower if you disabled all your addons?
[3:47:12] Badasti: mes designs the starship enterprise for the people
[3:47:13] Alohacuz: addons should be banned in tourneys for the highest competitive settings.
[3:47:15] amkttv: i think with addons being so prevalent, not playing with addons is griefing your friends and yourself, because you could be so much better
[3:47:25] BigHawkWoW: Crusader is probably the most knowledgeable player but he does to many horse tranquilizers
[3:47:45] meglo748: queues are fucked eh?
[3:47:51] aaggros: some things like trinket trancking and dr tracking should certainly be ingame UI
[3:47:52] Ultramagnus85: It shouldnt be that hard to tell when someone uses a cooldown
[3:47:59] Ultramagnus85: everyone should grow wings like paladins
[3:48:02] Badasti: @BigHawkWoW bro if he is that hyper after doing horse tranquilisers id hate to see what he's like after an energy drink
[3:48:06] rohmantv: pikaboos Addon is Absterge
[3:48:17] xilyx2: the complex raiding world of TBC
[3:48:26] ImShmoly: people didnt have any offensive cds
[3:48:28] nikthevoker: mage just novad spam lance LUL
[3:48:28] dropbombsss: gladdy and omnicd is all you needed
[3:48:33] BetterknownasJohn: even up to mop addons weren't really the be all end all
[3:48:35] rohmantv: absterge saying everything is about to happen before it does is pikaboos addon
[3:48:35] jayhovito: id like to see pikaboo and crusader do 2s, the players with the most awareness playing the most toxic bracket
[3:48:38] seaent: built in wow audio cues would be nice. resto shaman's character voice saying "my earthen totem is down, stay close!"
[3:48:48] eainzsp: He's comparing his new player experience to that of a new player now, and it's objectively very different.
[3:48:51] goatskull123: Yeah essence break's effect is goat
[3:48:51] zen_oni_shinobi: tiger palm was fun to watch with no timer addon.
[3:48:59] Badasti: same as shit talents like glass cannon, blizzard builsd the game expecting you to play it, or to download weakauras
[3:49:39] seaent: helldivers 2 now xD
[3:49:51] sukoWoW: based
[3:49:53] NovaSun84: not false.

[3:50:27] buzswagyo: why cant i log in
[3:50:28] Badasti: cough* diablo 4 Cough*
[3:50:31] Kymagez: easier to watch streams also
[3:50:32] BigHawkWoW: Ques are awful though I am paying 2 subs just to not sit 1h ques
[3:50:32] ieatpieasudie: we are boomers now
[3:50:35] NovaSun84: WoW Persists.
[3:50:35] Kymagez: then decide
[3:50:36] Hobblefoot: Cough SoD ... Cough Cough
[3:50:39] buzswagyo: would the game tell me if i need to re up my time
[3:50:51] Zlipps: I went back and started playing Shining Force again on the SEGA and it is just great.
[3:50:58] piggiepie: my steam is full with games I dont even know what are bout lol. I get them on discounts and never play them :(
[3:51:08] Snypes_SYCO: Going against glads in an 1800 mmr doesn't help
[3:51:17] yepbeef: no dr tracker
[3:51:18] Kymagez: same
[3:51:21] kusoneko: new youtube series idea
[3:51:24] Slayer_Eagleone: same
[3:51:29] goatskull123: atleast +18
[3:51:29] Hobblefoot: Nice!  You too @venruki    I think you both should do it.
[3:51:29] aaggros: I know plenty of ppl who only use details in M+
[3:51:32] zerx_gg: no littlewigs? monkaS
[3:51:35] xilyx2: pretty easy to carry in m+
[3:51:41] wackpoetic: impossible for m+, you never get invite
[3:51:46] varok87: You should review Crusader UI.
[3:52:01] Fatho3s: yeah crusader plays with no addons
[3:52:07] waelrick: 18 gives myth track gear in vault
[3:52:15] LUIGY_3: crusader even no raid frames
[3:52:23] WardenDOTA: the mythic mount isnt available its the heroic mount that is, right?
[3:52:24] fatlittlepaypig: asmon hasnt actually played retail in like 6 years hes out of touch
[3:52:28] Hobblefoot: @varok87 We should avoid giving that person any attention. LOL
[3:52:32] WardenDOTA: the owl is still mythic only
[3:52:33] ItsBees: I don't use a lot other than dbm and got keystone hero, not too hard :3
[3:52:39] xilyx2: logic is bad for engagement.

[3:53:33] markeexy: yea its based
[3:53:38] goatskull123: Yeah, I'm completely stopping PvE since I don't have the axe after clearing Fyrakk on all difficulties (except for mythic) every week since the start of the season
[3:53:38] koonakeenay: that is a double edged sword for me. i elect for vens view HOWVER, in times like bfa or others it still was fun SOMETIMES when there was a weapon or trinket you needed and it was from other content for pvp and it was a lot of fun when you got it
[3:53:40] BigHawkWoW: Sockets are annoying tho
[3:53:41] blackvpnv: its fun to be able to test all
[3:53:45] Kymagez: feral lol
[3:53:45] koonakeenay: but not getting it or wanting to get it sucks
[3:53:50] StromicusRex: "feral"
[3:53:50] Mechgyrasaur: no way you never played evoker before dragonflight Kappa
[3:53:54] kusoneko: BIG AGREE
[3:53:56] seaent: its as if they should make a free to play game based on wow arenas system....
[3:53:58] Badasti: thats how i played since Vanilla lol. That's why I didnt play legion, bfa or SL, because alts were almost impossible with all the chores
[3:54:03] What_ln_Tarnation: can prob thank SS for that
[3:54:03] Kymagez: i remember the day of feral
[3:54:21] Prplneon: queues are up!

[3:54:54] lumaday: from Kings Rest
[3:54:54] Ultramagnus85: cut of death
[3:54:54] figurines: PvE players need to be able to do pvp without re-gearing. its hard enough to get them to step into pvp
[3:54:55] Badasti: nah i cant agree with that, i dont want to be at a competitive disadvantage or forced into M+ to queue arena all day every day
[3:54:56] koonakeenay: or there was a resto sham trinket
[3:55:02] piffzorz: so many kings rest runs...
[3:55:08] Ultramagnus85: mechagon laser trinket
[3:55:10] Mikbt: u and how many? because majority of people dont have so much time. So for who they cater? What is the point of playing alters if the majority of the people dont have that time? I feel they are bringing a feature for little to enjoy.
[3:55:21] Mhortai: @venruki so I liked doing the Legendary axe questline etc. I did not like having to do raids on 3 different difficulties every week to get it finally lol. But I also don't enjoy raiding so.
[3:55:21] koonakeenay: yea agreed
[3:55:23] qixoni_: Drest Kreygasm
[3:55:23] blorange36: rogue needed sylv dagger in shadow lands, made me instant quit playing rogue. It was so stupid.
[3:55:26] pridez49: i love not having to pve for pvp shit
[3:55:27] dakotan517: FR
[3:55:30] wackpoetic: Unrelated to UI discussion, but PvP should be PvP Templates and battle pass rewards instead of rating rewards. I'm 100% convinced
[3:55:34] koonakeenay: that does suck thats why i mostly lean on your side. but sometimes its fun but yeah that sucks ass
[3:55:38] aaggros: lol ya
[3:55:44] zachgamegodx: im in a shuffle ven
[3:55:46] willie_stroker_99: Best expansion WoTLK, second best Legion
[3:55:46] notMase: having to do KR 16 for gett'iku was cancerous af i never even got it again in S4
[3:55:52] maenkins: now they're changing the dungeons every patch which makes it a bit more playable
[3:55:55] Badasti: @Mikbt to me its not even about time, i just dont want to be forced to do content i hate in order to do content i like
[3:55:56] aaggros: It is actually nice that there is m+ dungeon rotation now
[3:55:57] zachgamegodx: not cancelled
[3:56:03] amorandra: LOL
[3:56:05] ItsBees: rework boomkin Pog
[3:56:06] Pherix1: Kappa
[3:56:39] rdubm: idk why they dont adjust pvp regardless of the mdi like they can do pvp specific changes
[3:57:08] BigHawkWoW: They do make pvp specific changes they have been really good in df imo
[3:57:16] dakotan517: why would they when these people make them for free
[3:57:19] sukoWoW: it is what it is
[3:57:20] varok87: We will get balance patch at the start of next season in about 6 weeks Kappa
[3:57:20] WardenDOTA: its not gonna be resolved we are gonna have weakauras in real life soon with apple vision
[3:57:33] atticuslol: aww man, was interested to hear what you were saying but got 4 minutes of ads
[3:57:35] waelrick: weak auras in mythic raiding are so far gone
[3:57:36] Badasti: dragonslayers are playing wow with training wheels anyway
[3:57:39] Ignite_CLO: thats just wrong
[3:57:41] XilliumStorm: its getting really bad in raiding
[3:57:44] NovaSun84: ya the culture is extremely gated on that thought process.
[3:57:49] polarityshifter: I think it ties in with button bloat as well
[3:57:52] engzyng: goes to show ... pve ppl like robots :D
[3:57:52] ImShmoly: they create encounters that require these addons nowadays
[3:57:53] NovaSun84: it can't be simpler for more people to play.
[3:58:02] tformerz: Pve omegafkinglul

[3:58:26] FelQueen: I will tell you that the main game-changer to the PvP/M+/raid game was that Blizzard allowed you to zoom out your camera into Universe. We should ban this crazy zooming and allow only default initial view and you will see that addons don't matter PixelBob
[3:58:42] Mikbt: arenas are way too boring, they need to find new ways to pvp, its cool to play some arenas but they get boring AF, would be cool some new modes besides BGs and not competive but with competitive rewards, make it fun to play away from competitive aspect that destroys the experience
[3:58:42] NovaSun84: "hypetrain hopping"  lauren254Tinaa Love that.

[4:19:41] sharpdressedman15: dan john
[4:19:55] danieljjohnsonn: the annoying part for me is when Rogues judge their teammate for dying when they focused on 1 target (usually heal) an go stealth,while you’re being trained by 2 people🤣

[4:20:56] hamsti: kettle bells are supposed to be insanely effective actually.

[4:22:57] Badasti: I'm a big fan of isometric exercises
[4:23:04] shugguls: I do the same exercise but with my cat
[4:23:07] NovaSun84: that's a good starting point for using cowbells
[4:23:07] hamsti: that guy made all those exercises look really easy
[4:23:07] dropbombsss: @soddi if i had to ballpark his it looked like 20kg
[4:23:08] moremantella255: bro just stand up
[4:23:16] CrazyJoeDavola57: i like doing lateral raises with kettlebells
[4:23:25] fatlittlepaypig: that looks like it would blow my shoulder out
[4:23:29] zachgamegodx: that exercise looks limited by the weight size
[4:23:30] PeptoAbysmal: that def takes core strength
[4:23:33] hamsti: i'd be scared of dropping that shit on my head at that weight
[4:23:39] zachgamegodx: once u get to a certain point the ball becomes too big
[4:24:00] fatlittlepaypig: i used to OHP 185-200 and that would kill my shoulers
[4:24:04] fatlittlepaypig: in a bad way
[4:24:09] zerx_gg: extra motivator hamsti xdd
[4:24:15] zini7: pushing enyyhing over your head is hard
[4:24:22] soddi: the most workout that those kettlebells get is the postal guy carrying them to my door
[4:24:22] Kymagez: can he scull a bottle of vodka though?
[4:24:30] zachgamegodx: @soddi ROFL
[4:24:30] wowjumper: I just took the boat from Auberdine to Menehill on SoD, and it sent us all to the GY in Ashenvale

[4:25:03] Badasti: LUL
[4:25:04] hamsti: OMEGALUL
[4:25:06] NovaSun84: As a male gamer, is there a certain kettlebell weight to start with.  Was Supatease right in suggesting 5lb?
[4:25:06] Saitistreamy: There are 35k active players
[4:25:14] Saitistreamy: so 0.10% should be 4 people
[4:25:17] zachgamegodx: ngl im stoked that it's 35k ]
[4:25:17] WardenDOTA: that's 35 rank 1 u moron
[4:25:18] CrazyJoeDavola57: ven do you drink any caffeine?
[4:25:18] WardenDOTA: lol
[4:25:19] Badasti: ofc he does, he got his first r1 right after he earned his purple heart in 'naam
[4:25:41] Saitistreamy: Im def not r1
[4:25:43] jasuvex: too ez for him, just doesnt care enough
[4:25:47] halmz1919: math on that is very bad
[4:25:50] boostgold7: apparently alot of NA players are getting deserter
[4:25:51] Saitistreamy: I'm making a point about charity rewards people complain about
[4:26:01] mvpala_tv: no its 35 people - .001 is .10%
[4:26:01] wowjumper: His math is way off like 35,000 x .1 = ?
[4:26:04] ATHLTE: its def not charity lmao
[4:26:06] ATHLTE: like wha
[4:26:11] WardenDOTA: it's characters not accounts, we already knew that the pvp scene is just a bunch of dudes playing alts
[4:26:18] mfushi: you think servers are going to be fixed soon ?
[4:26:24] likeewlock: its like 120 spots
[4:26:24] fatlittlepaypig: isnt 0.1% 35
[4:26:27] fatlittlepaypig: and not 4
[4:26:28] Badasti: @Saitistreamy what charity bro, people dont want glad mounts to be given for free, nobody said r1 was easy, and its not
[4:26:36] mvpala_tv: @fatlittlepaypig ya
[4:26:38] skarny1: imagine being that bad at math KEKW
[4:26:41] Swishinn: didnt they make r1 account based and not character based now
[4:26:44] mvpala_tv: @likeewlock 35 gang
[4:26:45] bigmancamx: so if less people play it’s harder to get R1 hahaha
[4:27:01] rissel: wow-entertainer?
[4:27:02] Saitistreamy: The number of r1 slots, implies there are about 150k people playing
[4:27:03] gdodmebxu: @bigmancamx not really, it's % based
[4:27:07] Saitistreamy: in reality its way lower
[4:27:08] hamsti: KEKW
[4:27:17] WardenDOTA: why did you link 35k players when the seramate leaderboard goes past 50k?
[4:27:17] fatlittlepaypig: @Saitistreamy 0.1% of 35000 is 35 not 4
[4:27:22] PhDickens: what a unit
[4:27:25] NovaSun84: what the actual
[4:27:25] hamsti: OMEGALUL its so unnecessary i love it
[4:27:36] NovaSun84: justinegRofl
[4:27:39] boostgold7: oof the ankle snap potential
[4:27:40] CrazyJoeDavola57: man so risky though lol
[4:27:49] NovaSun84: i'm panicking and I know he's fine.  danisaurPanic

[4:28:02] hamsti: ITs interesting that theres english graphics on the walls of a russian gym
[4:28:04] fatlittlepaypig: that's just crackhead shit
[4:28:10] Saitistreamy: @fatlittlepaypig r1 is a ratio of 1 r1 slot per 1k players
[4:28:17] sind233: Theres only one God in all of athleticism and his name is kyriakos grizzly @venruki
[4:28:19] e10100111001: that's his job lel
[4:28:21] popzirl: thas dope

[4:28:53] zerx_gg: OK GN FELLAS
[4:28:54] zerx_gg: byeee
[4:28:55] nwafighta: looks like he comes too fast
[4:28:58] bigmancamx: @gdodmebxu right, so if less ppl play the game then there are less R1 spots. it being % based is an argument for it being harder
[4:29:02] Kymagez: bye zerx
[4:29:04] WardenDOTA: you miss typed 35 as 4 LOL
[4:29:08] WardenDOTA: your math was wrong bud

[4:36:21] stfn9301: hitting a big snatch is the best feeling
[4:36:21] fatlittlepaypig: deadlifting like 80% of my max is the sweet spot in terms of feeling for me
[4:36:25] Luigicamp: I liked cross country running when I was young. Endurance over speed was more my thing
[4:36:25] Axtin: i gave up
[4:36:31] Badasti: its a good exercise
[4:36:31] dipicat: if i deadlift i suck at everything else for a week so i dont do it much anymore either
[4:36:36] dipicat: that stimulus to fatigue ratio
[4:36:42] Axtin: ok 1 more try
[4:36:42] Reckwx: deadlifting is bad for you and gives terrible stimulus to fatigue
[4:36:54] fatlittlepaypig: i did PPL 6 days a week when i did it
[4:37:00] Ceerius: World Server is down
[4:37:04] willie_stroker_99: Let's make a poll if Ven is gonna make a game

[4:37:37] Mhortai: I logged into OW cuz I can do anything in WoW atm. I keep disconnecting IF I can even get in atm.

[5:21:06] waterfeesh: I wonder, is the average wait time even relevant to your mmr or does it take all mmrs into account LUL

[5:27:22] Kujo_XX: Because the whole point of the mode is to flesh out the weakest one, especially up to like 1800
[5:27:27] chizzad52: triple grounding sheer and double melee
[5:27:44] Hark0n: bro the more he gets trained the more he gets mentally stronger, its the path of all shadow priests, it cannot be avoided, just like taxes
[5:27:52] Kujo_XX: Sub 1800 is literally just a game of find the potato and peel it

[5:31:17] Schwenkyytv: call them bad for losing to spriest
[5:31:18] Not_J_o_n: I'd love to see the dh on sp and have the tables turned it's pure misery
[5:31:19] Outer_Limitz: You got the SP a win :)
[5:31:24] Cocoapuffs1: sucks you gotta take out the sp though

[5:35:04] sharpdressedman15: skill
[5:35:16] ATHLTE: dhs are literally thanos rn
[5:35:17] FunnyName26: DHs naturally cleave thats why
[5:35:24] Outer_Limitz: Someone on reddit told me its because they are glass cannons :)
[5:35:32] Nateypww: I love venruki
[5:35:33] FemboyQtx: passive cleave is bad for the game
[5:35:36] FunnyName26: Idk why ask Blizz lol
[5:35:39] Not_J_o_n: You think current dh same level as ret s1 atm
[5:35:48] numero5218: why are u insta 2k on everything you play. pretty rude
[5:35:52] Hark0n: imagine if you had to whirwind every 5 secs to cleave anything
[5:36:03] nimbus420i: @Not_J_o_n  nah, DH died, S1 ret was immortal and more peels for team
[5:36:04] akru_zz: bro DH got passive wings on 100% uptime
[5:36:06] nimbus420i: Dies*
[5:36:11] chizzad52: Thats how Dev is
[5:36:15] smoochins: s1 ret was beyond mortal comprehension
[5:36:25] sharpdressedman15: i could say the reason but it's politically incorrect
[5:36:36] FunnyName26: That's how they are. Their single target and aoe rotation are literally the same
[5:37:04] smoochins: yes
[5:37:06] nameyourform: yes
[5:37:07] blorange36: very

[5:37:13] dawnovun: Lol "Just make them aoe a shitload" was what they said when they talked about how to fix them
[5:37:15] Boruox: DH Tank meta
[5:37:16] waelrick: yes, tank and dps are both s tier
[5:37:21] zachgamegodx: dh and outlaw are really good
[5:37:34] zachgamegodx: both capable of 1 mill dps + sustained in certain pack
[5:37:47] gelatokush: sp too
[5:37:47] FunnyName26: Yes, it's poor design but some people like how brainless DH is to play
[5:37:49] gelatokush: mage too
[5:38:00] zachgamegodx: ye but fire crap in pvp
[5:38:18] Slayer_Eagleone: that poor dk is just tickling that mage lol
[5:38:22] Puffeynick: is BM brainlesser than DH?
[5:38:27] gelatokush: in m+ id say dh arent as on top then in pvp
[5:38:35] zachgamegodx: ye not as good for sure
[5:38:41] gelatokush: alot of good dps contenders in m+
[5:38:41] zachgamegodx: fire sp outlaw aare really good
[5:39:55] Slayer_Eagleone: so easy
[5:39:58] FunnyName26: Fistweaving in 2s seems really good
[5:40:50] saclol: No that's really poor design
[5:40:54] nameyourform: DHs just w in with no repercussions
[5:40:54] hoaylander: @FunnyName26 it's broken
[5:41:03] nightmxz: Hell yeah brother, RSK should aoe and fists of fury should 6 sec stun anything it hits and auto  stun trinkets
[5:41:07] Puffeynick: are DHs the most played class worldwide/overall? is it hunters?
[5:41:12] slickdaddyg69: 80 % of venrukis chat are below 1800 cr they all are clueless
[5:41:14] SteLawBro: Id rather be a demonhunter then be waddling around not being able to hit anything. Thats the worst. Give me all the moobility and damage but give people a way to deal with it.
[5:41:16] FunnyName26: Yeah it's poor design, but if people like DH then doubt blizz will change it
[5:41:16] chizzad52: I think fewer buttons is what I would like to see on other toons besides DH
[5:41:18] Spawrro: DH heals more passively than my ret does when trying to cast the instant heal constantly.. big sadge
[5:41:20] Not_J_o_n: Dh casually never the kill target that's what very annoying
[5:41:21] numero5218: yea make it aoe but you should aim it like league of legends ?
[5:41:22] sharpdressedman15: @slickdaddyg69 found the dh
[5:41:23] nameyourform: @slickdaddyg69 including you
[5:41:28] McLarge: I don't think that's what people mean when they say more classes should be like DH. I think they mean more classes should be simpler
[5:41:37] zachgamegodx: this chat is an exception
[5:41:41] zachgamegodx: we are all rank 1
[5:41:58] NightMunchies: im not raid til whoever runs Warcaft no Loot options for Anyone i just did 6 bosses not 1 dran loot drop not even pocket lint
[5:41:59] FunnyName26: @slickdaddyg69 Don't need to be a professional chef to know some food tastes like shit bud
[5:42:00] saclol: lmao
[5:42:03] smoochins: we are gonna get shit on"
[5:42:06] Grimey_George: rank 1 of the 1800s
[5:42:16] sharpdressedman15: if you play dh and are bellow 2600 you will be switching classes after they are nerfed
[5:42:20] hoaylander: i'm good with my classes complexity
[5:42:23] saclol: why make the game more simple? For crying out loud
[5:42:23] hoaylander: i don't want it to be simpler
[5:42:26] dakila24: are servers better yet?
[5:42:30] Kymagez: nah im 1400 but still can make slickdaddys mum wet mummy
[5:42:32] NightMunchies: no
[5:42:37] primejusticegaming: is this stuff finally working?
[5:42:38] FateIRL: servers seem fine as long as you dont move zones
[5:42:44] slickdaddyg69: I was hardstuck 1600 all my life then i switched to dh and been 2400 ever since
[5:42:46] SteLawBro: I'd rather melee be able to hit things and ranged be able to deal with it than not be able to hit things.
[5:42:51] NightMunchies: its not working great still messed up
[5:43:26] Bonegraft: ret
[5:43:27] primejusticegaming: War?
[5:43:27] nameyourform: ele
[5:43:29] FateIRL: rogues, every class should be like rogues
[5:43:29] nightmxz: assa should be the goal

[5:43:31] williwhite94: ret

[5:43:34] ihavesmokedcrack: ret

[5:43:39] zachioo: destro fr
[5:43:39] williwhite94: warlock
[5:43:41] ihavesmokedcrack: ret is a caster
[5:43:43] nightmxz: oh all casters are toxic lmao
[5:43:43] sharpdressedman15: classes should be balanced for difficulty. either that or easier classes should do less damage
[5:43:47] nameyourform: ele for sure
[5:43:49] FateIRL: ele, no casting required
[5:43:52] FateIRL: remove casting
[5:44:01] urack: Evoker devastatikn
[5:44:10] williwhite94: remove push back for casting
[5:44:12] primejusticegaming: Ret needs something else to make it more competitive. but for ladder it seems really good
[5:44:24] NightMunchies: more heals
[5:44:39] hamsti: true ret needs way more healing. auto b ubble too Kappa
[5:44:41] McLarge: I don't like DH's pressure coming from a DoT that can be applied from range. Especially given that it makes you play a talent that gives a Fury cost to Throw Glaive, it just makes the base rotation super clunky compared to what it was in Shadowlands.
[5:44:43] Chrono_s: this song LUL
[5:44:47] Smexxin: hot take but spriest is actually the most fun caster right now for me, and you basically have to cast everything
[5:44:49] brucesp93: are servers back???
[5:44:54] primejusticegaming: Rets healing is weaker than warlocks.
[5:44:56] hamsti: spriest looks super fun
[5:45:06] primejusticegaming: and ret literally has a healing button
[5:45:29] likeewlock: dark pact counts as heal so its dosent count
[5:45:31] hamsti: Its got everything. Spread dot damage, control, and decent burst @Smexxin
[5:45:40] Reiumi_: HUH
[5:45:45] slickdaddyg69: daym venruki has 33 glads must be nice having all the cool illusions + tabards
[5:45:45] williwhite94: i think ret has to much utility and damg cant be both maxxed out
[5:45:45] hoaylander: HUH
[5:45:49] waelrick: HUH
[5:45:57] addyz0r: big cuu...?? HUH
[5:46:05] hamsti: dang that guy explooted at the end
[5:46:09] urack: Evoker devastation. Insane damage, but killable @venruki
[5:46:12] FunnyName26: Dont blackout kick while Rising Sun Kick is off CD. You're wasting a chance to reset Rising sun kick @venruki
[5:46:19] McLarge: Ahh, yes. Frost Mage vs a Warrior, Classic matchup LUL
[5:46:23] primejusticegaming: @williwhite94 ret does less dmg than DH, and DH has a significant amount of utility as well as dmg and a mortal strike
[5:46:43] hoaylander: ah ret, the spec with 0 utility
[5:46:58] primejusticegaming: I didnt say they had 0 utility that wasnt my argument
[5:47:04] meatiusloaficus: how does this class's healing work
[5:47:04] williwhite94: @primejusticegaming DH is a whole another story that class has WAS to much gap closers and damg and self healing
[5:47:09] nimbus420i: yeah no sanc no bop no sac no freedom no off heals. Yep that is ret
[5:47:17] hamsti: how much vers do you have @nightmxz KEKW
[5:47:22] FemboyQtx: bruh
[5:47:25] nightmxz: @hamsti rukiGrin
[5:47:26] WardenDOTA: this guy doesnt kite he fucks
[5:47:28] FunnyName26: Guy must be playing 4D chess
[5:47:31] hamsti: OMEGALUL @nightmxz
[5:47:33] nightmxz: Hitting me is not a wise choice is all I'll say
[5:47:44] Spaceberry_McDuck: @nightmxz i like your logic
[5:47:54] primejusticegaming: All i said is that ret needs a little bit of something else. ANd i think everyone that plays ret can agree that their pvp talents are pretty weak compared to some other classes
[5:47:56] hoaylander: other than sac, bop, freedom, sanctuary, lay, auras and offheals of course
[5:47:56] sharpdressedman15: my shuffle boomy is build like that
[5:47:58] hamsti: lowkey you're still farmin' damage @nightmxz

[5:48:32] nightmxz: Death wish some kids
[5:48:39] Smexxin: what do you think is the most balanced/ethical spec in the game right now @venruki if you had to balance the game around that power
[5:48:41] Smexxin: for healers and dps
[5:48:46] hamsti: okay hear me out... full vers deathwish warrior?
[5:48:48] horiqt: what is that weapon enchant?
[5:48:51] nightmxz: oh yeah you'd evaporate vs this KEKW

[5:48:59] FemboyQtx: doesn't disc blow anus
[5:49:00] FunnyName26: No death wish, that MM might one shot
[5:49:05] nightmxz: @hamsti I can't see 48% vers being particularly bad for anything LMAO

[5:57:55] maybethistimepls: aug is lowk op. highest evoker on EU is aug. dont tell anyone its good though pls
[5:57:58] zachgamegodx: ven they’re not gonna stand still and take your burst, you’re a frost dk with 30 seconds longer on your cds and much less cross cc for your go
[5:58:03] zachgamegodx: as fury
[5:58:14] FunnyName26: What I hate the most is how much range some of these melee dps have. It's a bit too much. It makes sense for an enhance sham or survival, but others are silly
[5:58:32] hoaylander: fury sustained damage is not even in the same ballpark as frost dk
[5:58:41] hoaylander: and frost dk doesn't have mortal strike
[5:58:56] hoombledad: @FunnyName26 almost all ret dmg is range now lol
[5:59:17] FunnyName26: @FunnyName26 Exactly and they hit really hard from range too.
[5:59:23] maybethistimepls: trinket goes on CD after using undead racial? anyone know?

[6:00:30] FateIRL: @maybethistimepls yes they do
[6:00:33] zachgamegodx: outside of cd dmg prolly lower but who cares, it’s still not enough to force cds even in damp
[6:00:35] dolby24j: KEKW
[6:00:36] maybethistimepls: @bawscal i play dwarf. you can stoneform before using trinket and trinket will not go on CD
[6:01:08] Hark0n: no root break?
[6:01:13] lurian___: Feels bad seeing healers going 3-3, all that effort for 0 mmr change

[6:02:03] Izzythediscpriest: @lurian___ you actually lose mmr going 3-3 usually
[6:02:18] Izzythediscpriest: as a healer
[6:02:22] popzirl: whoever was higher mmr will lose
[6:02:26] popzirl: the other might gain
[6:02:29] popzirl: or 0
[6:02:40] Smexxin: its about the journey, not the destination
[6:02:42] lurian___: @Izzythediscpriest Even worse. I remember losing my mind after 16 lobbies in a row 3-3

[6:04:11] StromicusRex: gg i was the warrior
[6:04:16] popzirl: yeah i just went 3-3 because one healer threw i said try save cleanse for my roots as a DH he was just random dispelin
[6:04:30] LordRatigan: I mean thematically it would be accurate
[6:04:48] zachgamegodx: trying to win a shuffle as a fury warrior like trying to a track race with a punch buggy
[6:05:00] nerdyorc_: Deathwish is always the answer
[6:05:02] gracioussatan: venruki SLAMS the opposition
[6:05:05] TheShiftyPowers: i feel the same way. Amen brother amen
[6:05:10] FunnyName26: Are you optimistic for hero talents or just think they're conduits 2.0?
[6:05:14] dialupinternetconnection: Slam for dam
[6:05:15] FateIRL: if they dont notice you're deathwish you pump
[6:05:24] Ultramagnus85: they are soulbinds 2.0
[6:05:45] zachgamegodx: in order to do comparable dmg to dh you need to basically kill yourself
[6:05:50] waterfeesh: 30 min queue, 30 min game, +2 points for winning 4 rounds DansGame
[6:05:57] FunnyName26: True. Being positive is good. It's only a game
[6:06:00] tv_raz: any advice for playing against a hunter as arcane?
[6:06:03] gracioussatan: @FateIRL yeah gotta feel it out in the lobbies. it's usually obvious when someone has clown horns  going off from your deathwish
[6:06:26] waterfeesh: @tv_raz have your healer pillar and play ontop of you, peak out for burst
[6:06:28] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: Justin Trident is your President and u are optimistic. Kappa LUL

[8:01:19] JBugaboo: i dont think you'd necesarilly go 0-6, you'd have to adapt to the harder lobbies then it might sort itself out appropriately
[8:01:35] Brotali1ty: milfhunter lool
[8:01:35] JBugaboo: @JustTaki then you get this
[8:02:04] healhut: @venruki do you think there will be any pvp balance changes before awc?
[8:02:18] JustTaki: @JBugaboo what's wrong with it. You lose playing against people that are a little better than you and still get your CR goals
[8:02:33] nightmxz: but Ven the non-stop montage videos you could make with 0 mmr on every toon
[8:02:36] Hobblefoot: Low MMR has its own set of challenges to be fair. LOL.  No one listens, everyone lines healers or ranges them and DPS are often off on random targets. Half the people don't know what DR is and ... well I mean it is still easier than high rated games but you get my point. It can be .... frustrating. LOL
[8:02:37] JBugaboo: creates an environment where some people have to try harder for say 2.1 then other people at 2400  from last season (its irrelevant) sandbag for the appearance
[8:03:07] JustTaki: @JBugaboo yeah but that means they got 2.6 last season the work goes in at some point
[8:03:10] JBugaboo: @JustTaki thats if you have a pre defined mmr, new people with the 1500 mmr or whatever is default dont get that mmr privilege boost
[8:03:12] JustTaki: nobody gets anywhere for free
[8:03:12] tehcahteh69: insta q always double DH melee lobby
[8:03:25] nightmxz: Sounds good, I got things to do anyway GGs buddy :)
[8:03:35] boomkin_exploit: is that the best windwalker month on earth
[8:03:41] JBugaboo: each season should be a full reset @JustTaki just because its benefited you (and me) doesnt mean its right
[8:03:58] JBugaboo: @JustTaki another reason the pvp community doesnt gro
[8:04:03] VetisBR: that big purple bow covering your tramp stamp
[8:04:11] JustTaki: @JBugaboo I disagree \o/
[8:04:33] Hobblefoot: I am super excited for Solo Rated BGs.  Even if it might be terrifying in practice with queues longer than even SOLO right now.
[8:04:34] Moobot: Latest video "Retail PvP Is Plagued With Problems Right Now… And Players Are Not Happy" view it here: youtu.be/sTd8uoLysI4
[8:04:46] Ultramagnus85: Ven you beat me earlier and I cried about wanting elite but I just got it
[8:04:52] JBugaboo: @JustTaki aight enjoy your free weapon illusion, pvp wont be here in 2 years
[8:05:52] JustTaki: @JBugaboo I disagree about that too. How does it help the community grow for a fresh player to EVER face a glad player when they are placing.
[8:06:11] Vigi9413: the ret might regret taking the que
[8:06:12] JustTaki: full reset just doesn't make sense anymore
[8:06:16] Hobblefoot: @JBugaboo It would be nice to see the Rank 1 players have to crawl past the terrors of 1200 MMR in Solo over and over. :P
[8:06:25] JBugaboo: @Hobblefoot true
[8:06:39] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot they would win every game lol
[8:06:46] JBugaboo: @JustTaki then explain why mthic plus is the most thriving wow gamemode and has a full reset every season?
[8:07:01] JBugaboo: @JustTaki with shitter rewards than pvp
[8:07:10] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu I disagree. I mean they would find a way eventually but they would have their share of misery.

[8:07:16] JustTaki: @JBugaboo because incentives are aligned everybody is on the same boat trying to kill NPCs not pinned against each other
[8:07:18] Vigi9413: so what’s the convo chat? an mmr reset every season?
[8:07:59] JBugaboo: @JustTaki and the cream rises to the crop correct? which become the r1 players, just like that the true glad players wouldnt be at 1500 mmr long
[8:08:12] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot this is just not true. they'd win almost every game. 1200 players make a ton of mistakes that you can instantly win the game off of
[8:08:26] JBugaboo: @JustTaki not carried by last season
[8:08:49] gdodmebxu: if you play well you don't get stuck at low mmr
[8:08:55] JBugaboo: exactly
[8:09:44] gdodmebxu: you get stuck by not acknowledging what you can do better and blaming the game
[8:09:47] wackpoetic: WoW should have PvP templates for gear, and should be completion-based Battle Pass for rewards instead of arbitrary ratings
[8:10:07] Vigi9413: woah bud
[8:11:15] JBugaboo: i think the least they could do is instead 2400 requirement or whatever number it should be % based off spec.
[8:11:39] JBugaboo: Right now as we speak a 2100 solo shuffle outlaw rogue is NA rank 150 and a 2100 havoc demonhunter is NA rank 2500
[8:11:43] Vigi9413: damn close one
[8:11:44] JBugaboo: but they get the same rewards
[8:11:49] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu You said every game. That is what I disagreed with.
[8:12:05] ottisrot: Blizzard should actually make an attempt at pvp before anything else. Im honeslty shocked wow has a pvp base anymore bc its such dogshit
[8:12:20] JBugaboo: ^^
[8:12:48] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot yeah, that's fair. the every is definitely an exaggeration
[8:12:53] Vigi9413: I don’t think it’s dogshit I get a lot of enjoyment from watching and playing pvp
[8:13:09] JustTaki: @ottisrot cmonBruh
[8:13:15] JBugaboo: the systems are just dogshit, i think the gameplay is fine
[8:13:42] boomkin_exploit: that looked just chatting
[8:13:44] Locturnal_TV: show mog pls
[8:13:45] ottisrot: @Vigi9413 you can get all the enjoyment you want, it's dogshit in general. Pvp the system, the "balancing" is dogshit
[8:14:10] JBugaboo: balancing has been bad yeah dhs own this shit
[8:14:14] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu I would say you were right if they were healing exclusively against me though. hahaha I am terrible
[8:14:30] wackpoetic: Honestly balance right now still feels better than most other times in recent history
[8:14:42] yashcx: bro i dunno how u playing frost mage feels so weak rn
[8:14:51] ottisrot: Literally heal in solo shuffle and tell me balancing is in a good spot
[8:14:51] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot everyone has things they can improve
[8:14:58] Ronsimus: @ottisrot u are not wrong, there is a clearcut reason the playerbase is so low
[8:15:26] yashcx: any decent healer will just dispell frost bomb and most classes can avoid ray by melding or feign death ect
[8:15:27] JBugaboo: @ottisrot have you had to heal against double dh
[8:15:31] JBugaboo: that shit wild lmao
[8:15:50] yashcx: leave you with ice lance and frost bolt xD
[8:16:10] ottisrot: @Ronsimus Totally, the pvp playe base is pathetic today. We literally have the most fluent gameplay of any mmo and one of the loudest communities "not the purple haired part" and still blizzard CAN not do this right
[8:16:52] saren8: I was really expecting some PvP tuning and am feeling really let down by the devs
[8:17:02] saren8: The current state of the game is really unenjoyable for most of the playerbase :/
[8:17:03] Hobblefoot: @ottisrot I love this. So true. The game is so good in so many ways. I have tried other PVP in MMOs and this game is truly the best.
[8:17:09] Dakkoro: wow pvp always feels nice but the balance is always out of wack. By "nice" i mean the gameplay is solid vs say SoD
[8:17:12] vanncleff: Show the results table please
[8:17:19] JBugaboo: @ottisrot pve is def there cash cow that they pump into, pvp is like a small passive income that they dont want to kill because its generating SOMEKIND of revenue but not worth juicing to them
[8:17:29] JBugaboo: the last true dev update for pvp was like season 1
[8:17:29] Hobblefoot: YES Ven!  I hate that playstyle too. LOL
[8:17:37] yashcx: frost feels kinda unplayable at high mmr
[8:17:56] Hobblefoot: @yashcx What is this high mmr you speak of. I have never seen this place.
[8:18:15] reaperz14: I think ven is addicted to solo shuffle boys
[8:18:16] yashcx: im 2.4k atm with my frost mage ive dropped down to 2.1 in 2s
[8:18:29] ShayTime: what frost mage comp is good enough to play to glad this season
[8:18:48] Hobblefoot: Okay I am 92 out of 161 games baby and am closer to 1400 than ever before!  Lets go Hobble Shammy!
[8:18:49] Ronsimus: @ottisrot very true, though i feel like them as gamedevelopers should deside how pvp should be and not the community. if they had good developers
[8:18:50] yashcx: probably demo lock is best bet with a frost mage
[8:19:22] yashcx: but then again its no way near arcane/outlaw
[8:20:10] yashcx: maybe im wrong but the way i see it is frost bomb can be dispelled by almost all healers and ray can just be avoided so it feels weak to me
[8:20:16] ottisrot: @Ronsimus Well yeah I agree, they should be monitoring pvp like they do pve. Sadly, this right here is all we have been given in 20 yrs hahaha
[8:20:51] Badabingpow: Elite EZ
[8:21:04] gdodmebxu: @yashcx everyone is night elf
[8:21:08] gdodmebxu: @yashcx and melds it
[8:21:14] Ronsimus: and also the argument about blizzard not investing in because of numbers vs pve. they should be asking themself why the numbers are low, pvp has huge potential
[8:21:17] Blitzylive: ven please no
[8:21:20] Hobblefoot: Yeah you helped me through a long day of work, brother.
[8:21:22] yippey_: ggs ven
[8:21:22] Blitzylive: please stay a long time
[8:21:24] yashcx: exactly but hunters can also feign death it
[8:21:28] borrlock: Ggs
[8:21:29] WardenDOTA: miestro waiting room
[8:21:29] VetisBR: ggs
[8:21:31] WardenDOTA: is over
[8:21:33] nightmxz: HeyGuys have a good evening
[8:21:33] ottisrot: @Ronsimus They dont give a shit anymore
[8:21:37] famous1939: gn ven ggs
[8:21:41] VetisBR: W
[8:21:55] Ronsimus: @ottisrot yeah ita sad
