[2:10:31] Glebk0: do it now
[2:10:38] Releaze: how would you describe "based" if a family member asked what it means
[2:10:48] Sognus: THEYKEEPTICKING
[2:10:50] MidasPL: Draw in paint
[2:10:59] MegastorM36: stacking gives stab for condi to stay rolling uninterrupted
[2:11:01] Sognus: just post the emote
[2:11:02] niko_is_bad: aaaa
[2:11:03] wanderingfermi: its like AHHHHH
[2:11:04] Sognus: as video
[2:11:05] Sognus: OMEGALUL
[2:11:05] silimaur: think you have to describe it using 1 attack doing 100 damage either power or condi
[2:11:05] MissKisyana: condi - damage over time
[2:11:09] Airu91: Say what you think regardless of what others think about it or you
[2:11:13] MegastorM36: quickness and alacrity help with condi speed also when stacked

[2:11:37] Sognus: I can say something like: Solar was best balance dev we ever had
[2:11:43] Tritophs: explain it so that all the condi stacks from 1 skill would be the same as 1 power hit
[2:11:45] MissKisyana: @Sognus unironically
[2:11:46] Selhorys: Based is almost always used ironically
[2:11:58] pickled_choya: cerus cm will save gw2 copium

[2:13:45] MissKisyana: "I will never lose to a tree" -War Thunder player on his first day
[2:13:54] Nike_DnT: trash parse inc
[2:14:14] descin: chat has the team cleared the tier on mythic?
[2:14:19] Sognus: you have irl? Pog

[2:14:27] Nike_DnT: @descin 7/9
[2:14:32] Sognus: MORE TREES WILL GROW xddTree
[2:14:34] Tritophs: @descin they're still on tindral
[2:14:44] Sognus: and you also dont have food
[2:14:47] MissKisyana: Speaking of unpopular opinions: GW2 is kinda losing the artistic/style direction
[2:14:48] Ascleph: The only way to explain it convincingly is to compare numbers and to show that the loss of uptime on a condibuild is as bad as a power one.
[2:14:49] Sognus: oh you have now
[2:14:49] MidasPL: What are parses for tanks based on?
[2:15:15] Sognus: its time for raidcore parse
[2:15:19] Sognus: gw2 parsing
[2:15:28] Dorian_grey2116: BIG NUMBER
[2:15:44] descin: @Nike_DnT thx for the heads up
[2:15:48] MidasPL: We need mechanics parsing on wingman
[2:15:52] wanderingfermi: skipping deimos greens Zased
[2:16:21] MidasPL: Like publicly seen "Player X did green Y times successfuly on Dhuum"
[2:16:27] Sognus: catJAM
[2:17:12] Sognus: @MidasPL raidcore tracks that but it will not be released in this decade xddTree
[2:18:15] Sognus: Sneb caused it
[2:18:18] eaSyRoca: interesting, bc wow AND ff14 build their entire systems to incentivize statics over pugging
[2:18:39] MightyTeaBot: Subscribe to the stream to become an epic gamer! PogChamp bit.ly/tpotSub
[2:18:39] Ascleph: @eaSyRoca they both have an extremely healthy pugging scene though
[2:19:10] eaSyRoca: wow does so in m+, but in mythic it's borderline impossible to pug due to how IDs work
[2:19:24] Sognus: in lostark as well. you cannot progress there unless you join group. Either static or pug. And that applies to secondary systems as well
[2:20:44] eaSyRoca: i mean fair, but then without the ID memes you could also find replacements rather than having to have 20 people loose their weekly ID because one tank leaves early
[2:20:57] Ascleph: even the FFXIV LFG lets you set automatic item level and clear restrictions to joining
[2:21:16] pickled_choya: NA gw2 pugging is psychological torment
[2:21:25] eaSyRoca: if you're ahead of the curve you can, if you're even slightly behind it's so rat
[2:21:48] Sognus: its ez to lfr and normal mode but not heroic and mythic and as for m+ 15+ is impossible to fill with people that are atleast my level (and I am pretty bad)
[2:21:54] eaSyRoca: i'm 3.4k rating and healer, i still take >1h at times to get let into a pug that makes me even a little progress

[2:22:33] Sognus: Gw2 kinda goes with whims of players
[2:22:38] silimaur: its good as long as it doesn't kill it. Like anet did not want easier versions of raid bosses but probably should have re-thought it :P
[2:22:44] emecci: they are
[2:22:55] Nani_GW: they should hire solar Kappa

[2:24:06] Dorian_grey2116: That doesn't make sense
[2:24:19] Vultarios: hello, GW2 question :) does zone questing XP scale with level? or do i need to progress to a zone fit fo rmy level to gain the correct xp

[2:24:43] Vultarios: cheers mate
[2:24:48] descin: @eaSyRoca but pugging is more for heroic and m21 keys I think?
[2:25:06] silimaur: you take the initiative which is rare in any game
[2:25:16] eaSyRoca: @descin i was mostly thinking mythic bc i consider that the relevant raid difficulty tbh
[2:25:31] Sognus: its definitely tank and rating from s2. for me its impossible to pug almost
[2:25:33] jasper1864: are your graphics settings on max?
[2:25:40] eaSyRoca: it's true tht pugging hc raid is very easy once you got your initial clear
[2:26:02] descin: @eaSyRoca sure but for ff14 progging relevant ultimates is also complete pain. Altough the issue in that case is not the system I guess
[2:26:07] eaSyRoca: i'm playing like the most meta healer there is, why am i not getting perma invited Sadge
[2:26:41] eaSyRoca: @descin in ff14 the loot-lockout system still prevents you from pugging mostly early into a tier where ppl care about getting gear
[2:27:09] Dathremar1987: if dividing the community is a bad thing according to arenanet then why the decision to add other game modes to the game like pvp and wvw? Are those modes seen as community division? What about arena in wow?
[2:27:10] Sognus: just sellout
[2:27:10] pickled_choya: only fans enabled
[2:27:19] jasper1864: harder to run this game or gw2 on max?

[2:29:37] Sognus: @MightyTeapot btw what are guild reqs for random heroic runs? xd
[2:29:38] steady_shal: WoW and XIV are probably the most puggable mmorpgs.
[2:29:54] itsky_syrup: my gear is ass
[2:29:58] Dathremar1987: despite the "toxic" reputation wow pugging has it is the most usable pugging system Ive used in any mmo

[2:33:28] silimaur: sneb is always growing a beard, that is his secret
[2:33:33] Angeels: people would change their gear very quick if people had to experience the great filter that is the wow lfg tool
[2:33:40] lordfitna: i havent seen teapot without his beard though
[2:33:56] Nani_GW: a beard is tactical to keep your face warm in Canadian winter , sneb is not optimized smh
[2:34:30] Sognus: wow lfg tool is better than gw2's but still not perfect but one filter addon helped that a lot
[2:34:36] eaSyRoca: i mean if you consider gw2's a kp a sort of scuffed rio, they're halfway there Keepo
[2:34:39] jasper1864: how could they do it to where people who are not experienced would be able to find groups and become experienced?
[2:34:47] descin: @Angeels even if you get booted and there is a little bit of spice, does it really matter? Think most people dont really mind it if they learn something new and get kicked cause its not working at that moment

I am 100% sure arenanet ports something. We kinda know that gw2 has some overlaps with T&L which is UE4 (mainly server tech) and some part of arenanet development pipeline is UE4 and exportage into gw2 engine.

[3:45:01] Edeslash: LFR rageheart is not worthless, I sell it every single week for 250 000 gold
[3:45:04] tomdotdll: so normal drops heroic level
[3:45:13] eyxx: it's like the only survivability trinket worth using on casters
[3:45:25] NotYetRatedd: i literally lose 60% dps from equipping normal rageheart, dont think ill be equipping it from now on

[3:47:31] brushbro: SoD hype?

[3:47:35] kronnnotv: warrior gigachad class
[3:47:47] Edeslash: You only need the DPS maximizing if youve already wiped
[3:48:05] niko_is_bad: but then he griefs his raid no
[3:48:05] ViviLouF: I dont refuse to I'd just need full mythic loot funnel

[4:42:51] maplelost: going from a modern mmo with all the QoL to classic is brutal
[4:43:06] emecci: id give up right here
[4:43:36] Sathenus: @neuronutz hardest part of retail is setting up UI, thankfully there's some good addon packs out there like AtrocityUI etc
[4:44:05] ciraxa: read the wiki

[4:44:34] Nike_DnT: and figure it out along the way
[4:45:03] eyxx: very Zased
[4:45:24] eyxx: i recently played a game called rain world and it really cemented this

[4:47:46] eyxx: it's also just the way modern gamers engage with the medium now

[4:50:14] neuronutz: so if I get the base edition of WoW The War Within and pay a sub fee, I'll have everything I need to start?
[4:50:32] NotYetRatedd: yep TWW + sub is all you need
[4:50:44] TheOrangeThunder: as an american i want nothing more than an authentic full english. suppose i wont get that though until i visit the uk
[4:50:44] neuronutz: perfect!
[4:51:11] ciraxa: yes, the sub allows you to play Classic and Retail, buying War Within gives you access to the next expacs and all previous expacs including Dragonflight
[4:51:25] ciraxa: expac*
[4:51:31] neuronutz: awesome!
[4:51:36] tomdotdll: hahaha, all these problems are self-made anyway. Nobody ever said to each one "this is how you'll spend your days on this game from now on". So, nobody care about how hard it is for WF guilds. We alread have to deal with the consequences. Raids getting harder and harder, requiring tons of auras to even stand a chance, systems designed to screw the top 1%, etc. that end up only screwing the normal players (Legion legendary drop caps, covenant choice, etc. you name it).
[4:51:37] neuronutz: thank you for the help chat!

So, nobody care about how hard it is for WF guilds. We alread have to deal with the consequences. Raids getting harder and harder, requiring tons of auras to even stand a chance, systems designed to screw the top 1%, etc. that end up only screwing the normal players (Legion legendary drop caps, covenant choice, etc. you name it).

[4:53:54] Sathenus: the holy paladins ones look weird af
[4:54:05] hatad: typical gw2 player opinion
[4:54:24] lord_konstantine: I am a Paladin enjoyer and Lightsmith and placing weapons around seems like too much work especially with how much clutter there already is in M+
[4:54:28] Vestina: People just wanted them for the RP like class fantasy but it seems to be leaning the other way

[4:54:51] ciraxa: hero talents seem to focus on shit mechanics of the specs as well, like pushing PI or giving paladin little things that others can pick up
[4:55:15] aFlyingGuru: @MightyTeapot i think the hero talents have the same issue that weapon mastery does in gw2 (if a hero talent tree is really powerful for for example ret paladin and you have to nerf it, you also nerf it for prot and holy even though those specs might not be too strong with it)
[4:55:21] NotYetRatedd: I like it solely for adding RP flavor and changing up the rotation a bit, I'm ngl think it wouldve been extremely boring without Hero Talents next xpac, any gameplay changes is what I always look forward to really
[4:55:24] eyxx: i'm scared that they're gonna make one of the warlock trees be around your primary demon
[4:55:26] eyxx: OMEGALUL

[4:56:29] Glebk0: just click the spells
[4:56:39] Glebk0: true vanilla experience
[4:56:56] lord_konstantine: I just hope Templar is good because I dont wanna play Lightsmith on prot pally just because of how annoying it looks to deal with the weapons. But I guess you can have cast @ player macros and automate it as just an extra CD

[4:58:04] jeik_jkmc: @eyxx i honestly don't know what they are gonna do for warlock
[4:58:10] ciraxa: did they change the Druid tree? it was super weird to put so many points in caster talents as Feral just to get Omen
[4:58:49] Glebk0: you can spend in any tree and get points per level?
[4:59:03] ViviLouF: Vanilla :drahjbude

[5:08:34] Angeels: unless they go crazy
[5:08:43] eyxx: yeah either before or right after
[5:08:59] eyxx: i'd be extremely surprised if they didn't do one before midnight
[5:09:05] slappen_distel: BFD got me 28k XP full clear
[5:09:18] Angeels: shadowlands was like 10k dps xdTree
[5:09:20] NotYetRatedd: the preview showed 580 ilvl or something but obviously not the best indication of it going up in TWW
[5:09:25] JoJoPhantom: I enjoyed doing millions of damage .-.
[5:09:30] eyxx: they should unironically divide all numbers by 100
[5:09:37] tomdotdll: Ye same, I really like the DF numbers
[5:09:45] Angeels: DF numbers are pretty spot on
[5:09:53] NotYetRatedd: Chaos Bolt hit for 3.3m in MoP ZasedInfinite
[5:09:54] lord_konstantine: Warframe damage numbers xddTree
[5:10:06] Da_Funkz: Tauren! :)
[5:10:07] Angeels: bro no
[5:10:12] JoJoPhantom: I understand how doing millions makes it more difficult to gauge what you're ACTUALLY doing,  but you know,  different strokes.
[5:10:19] Da_Funkz: Small numbers are more interesting
[5:10:23] Da_Funkz: Launch gw2 was great
[5:10:28] Da_Funkz: Remove all boons
[5:10:34] ViviLouF: I like 200k being good ST
[5:10:38] Angeels: no small numbers are way less interesting objectively as 5% gains show less and hte like
[5:10:39] ViviLouF: 1Mil aoe feels good
[5:10:40] strapzmvp: its all relative really doesn't bother me
[5:11:08] eyxx: i think both have pros and cons tbf
[5:11:20] lord_konstantine: Numbers? I dont even have a DPS addon. I just want the dungeon completed GIGACHAD
[5:11:31] eyxx: big numbers allow for higher precision but lose part of their meaning/impact at some point
[5:11:43] ThaKrulll: Like in Lost Ark. Millions in DPS
[5:11:45] Da_Funkz: It all goes back to vanilla wow
[5:12:02] NotYetRatedd: how about going the other direction and having level 10 dps be in the decimals and level 70 being 10dps
[5:12:12] JoJoPhantom: @ThaKrulll there are builds that can hit for a bil
[5:12:14] Lodi098: just wait untill the numbers cause an overflow the squish
[5:12:20] tomdotdll: Legion numbers Zased
[5:12:24] eyxx: 1 dps
[5:12:39] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[5:12:43] Hundred123: 0.1 dps
[5:12:59] spruudel: 100 parse should be 1 dps at max
[5:13:12] lord_konstantine: Fit the legion theme either way, everything was hyped up and over the top during Legion
[5:13:13] eyxx: i'm doing a damage per second
[5:13:27] ViviLouF: 5 dps should be good damage
[5:13:33] ViviLouF: 2 dps absolute dogshit
[5:13:37] NotYetRatedd: 0.862 overall damage
[5:13:45] Angeels: Legion also makes sense from a roleplay perspective
[5:13:51] portabledog: yo vivi
[5:13:55] Angeels: as you were juiced up wit literal ancient artifacts
[5:14:06] Angeels: fighting literal gods
[5:14:26] NotYetRatedd: and then you traded it away for the watered down version the next xpac Zased (but not zased)
[5:14:36] eyxx: i hope we start getting more ridiculous bullshit stories with metzen back
[5:14:47] Angeels: bro third part of the world soul saga
[5:14:49] Angeels: where we fight the titans
[5:14:50] Angeels: Zased
[5:14:54] lord_konstantine: Zased
[5:14:57] tomdotdll: Legion was the last good wow expansion
[5:14:59] portabledog: this guy is cracked
[5:15:05] IkkisBlackpyre: people probably did less than 1k dps back in og vanilla
[5:15:11] NotYetRatedd: For too long I was bound by the shackles of the titans. Now my mind is open to infinite possibilities...
[5:15:18] Angeels: shadowlands was a good expansion (sorry im too zased for you all) (thd is my idol)
[5:15:19] eyxx: i hope iridikron swoops in after every raid boss and steals their power before escaping
[5:15:20] ciraxa: I’ll give SoD another chance NAILS
[5:15:38] lord_konstantine: Dragonflight is a Zased expansion
[5:15:39] eyxx: then at the end of the midnight or last titan we fight some giga void iridikron
[5:15:50] aFlyingGuru: @Angeels gameplay looked interesting but the story and lore is the worst theyve ever done by far awk
[5:16:10] Da_Funkz: I did ashenvale on an alt last night and there were no horde, we get easy win as alliance lul
[5:16:15] Angeels: i would have genuinely liked shadowlands
[5:16:18] Angeels: NO
[5:16:44] NotYetRatedd: SL was actually pretty good at launch but I dont think you guys wouldve liked the amount of mandatory memes and gearing being way slower
[5:17:59] ciraxa: next week I’ll get Fyr‘alath Clueless
[5:18:00] comrade_raptor: SL was dog shit with the exception of castle nathria was good
[5:18:00] lord_konstantine: I look at M+ seasons as kind of like PoE seasons - especially now with the dungeon rotation which I think is an awesome idea
[5:18:09] Snizzlenose: people say that Shadowland was a terrible expansion say it because it's trendy to say, it was ok. Castle Nathria was a banger raid
[5:18:10] jeik_jkmc: do you want a summon?
[5:18:19] Sognus: mmos are not about fun for long time. It needs you to lock in to sell you gemstore stuff, to sell you gacha. fomo, happy hormone pumping, etc.

[5:20:05] eyxx: so there will always be some bullshit i'd personally rather not have in those
[5:20:06] tomdotdll: Take the single player games pill
[5:20:09] lord_konstantine: I am more OK with the gear progression now, back when it was titanforged shit. only 1 item with no choice from weekly chest, and in BFA literal talents locked inside gear pieces - starting over each patch was very frustrating
[5:20:12] eyxx: which is fine
[5:20:39] eyxx: plenty of smaller niche games for rehab from any cringe garbage you might encounter in mainstream ones

[6:05:37] eyxx: @eaSyRoca NCSoft earnings in the shitter in general, gw2 holding up somewhat
[6:05:41] ciraxa: NCSoft is fukd
[6:05:54] eaSyRoca: bad?
[6:05:54] eyxx: still kinda scary since the NC was barely breaking profit last year
[6:06:28] eaSyRoca: i mean, obviously since famous streamer MightyTeapot has officially quit gw2, numbers are down
[6:06:32] eaSyRoca: it's to be expected tbh
[6:06:38] MightyTeaBot: doot doot

[6:07:43] eyxx: yeah gw2 has held up way better than most other things but it's still kinda spooky
[6:07:45] dolordolo: unluck
[6:08:11] niko_is_bad: ncsoft profit is all in aion and lineage no
[6:08:18] fullkontakt971: i wanna try a wow (playing guild wars right now) do you recommend me classic and retail? and what the difference between the two

[6:09:02] dolordolo: first glance tells me the biggest financial hits were in Asia and Korea
[6:09:04] ViviLouF: @portabledog frfr
[6:09:07] dolordolo: no sense in cutting down on gw2
[6:09:29] dolordolo: marketing probably takes a lot more for the mobile apps anyways
[6:09:35] dolordolo: and other asian stuff
[6:09:50] eyxx: yeah rationally there's no reason to cut on gw2 but if the company was always smart they wouldn't be in this hole to begin with
[6:10:01] emecci: feetman
[6:10:37] fullkontakt971: ok .... when you say ( similar to guild wars 2 ) i was already sold

[6:17:46] ciraxa: i can try priest sure, I’m abandoning Druid for now
[6:17:46] eaSyRoca: so, stupid question perhaps, but what's kinda the "goal" in sod
[6:17:52] eaSyRoca: (i have no clue about any classic stuff)

[6:25:22] eyxx: big
[6:25:27] eyxx: what class do you play mr pig
[6:25:36] limeoflight: @fatlittlepaypig My grandma can clear 7/10 mythic and she died in 2002
[6:26:02] limeoflight: I cant clear it tho FeelsOkayMan
[6:26:11] fatlittlepaypig: Despairge
[6:26:25] niko_is_bad: 7/10 means that they can't clear a boss that got nerfed to basically a heroic boss
[6:26:28] niko_is_bad: Aware
[6:26:50] aFlyingGuru: 7/10 means they are playing a secret version of the raid with an extra hidden boss after fyrakk
[6:26:51] fatlittlepaypig: err 7/9 not 10, theyre on tindral
[6:26:56] fatlittlepaypig: yea lmfao

[6:27:01] limeoflight: 2024 herpoc tho Aware
[6:27:14] niko_is_bad: 7/9 ye
[6:27:58] limeoflight: the 10'th boss is yourself after you realize you spend half your weeknights in what is essentially zoom meetings only to do it again next tier
[6:28:00] limeoflight: Aware
[6:28:03] ViviLouF: Tindral is about LFR magmorax difficulty
[6:28:07] ViviLouF: maybe slightly easier
[6:28:17] eyxx: oh wait the fyrakk intermission privateaura change actually went through nice
[6:28:18] fatlittlepaypig: 10th boss are the guildies we kicked along the way YEP
[6:28:22] eyxx: less jank
[6:28:25] eyxx: FeelsGoodMan
[6:28:26] aFlyingGuru: the 10th boss is big nose ted
[6:28:50] emecci: the corpses of the healers we replaced all mash together into a meat amalgamation forming the 10th boss
[6:28:56] emecci: Roster CM CM
[6:29:17] emecci: with dranet being the head
[6:29:33] aFlyingGuru: the doctor arenanet hydra NAILS
[6:29:41] niko_is_bad: With dranet being the only competent healer
[6:29:42] niko_is_bad: Gladge
[6:29:48] limeoflight: the healers never last long, they instinctually gravitate back towards catgirl erp in ffxiv
[6:29:48] ViviLouF: Doctor Arenanet, the Eleventh. GodEmperor

[6:33:23] TrayvonKing: KEKW
[6:33:35] aFlyingGuru: level 33 Pig NAILS

[6:36:28] aFlyingGuru: no threat issues

[6:38:33] SeriousJester: the dps have no threat concept
[6:38:43] SeriousJester: I blame Darens
[6:39:09] NotYetRatedd: press Elysian then idk not my fault lol xddShrug
[6:39:16] SeriousJester: we went right first
[6:39:19] SeriousJester: idk if that's correct
[6:39:57] niko_is_bad: I usually just jump behind the tank before he stops cus he has aggro
[6:40:05] aFlyingGuru: the average havoc main doesnt even have friendly party frames enabled Dentge they see enemy, they press "The Hunt" and "Metamorphosis" immediately and at max range
[6:40:18] NotYetRatedd: true and real
[6:40:52] limeoflight: @aFlyingGuru I main havoc on wow and reaper in gw2 and that could not be closer to the truth
[6:40:53] limeoflight: Aware
[6:41:03] SeriousJester: @MightyTeapot think I'll go arms when leveling
[6:41:04] emecci: when u pug as dps u will notice that people with lfg their keys for actual hours

[6:44:01] ciraxa: idk about higher keys but in 20s there’s tanks who can’t hold aggro no matter how long you wait with doing a 1m dps burst
[6:44:07] ViviLouF: HOLY same model as DHT bats
[6:44:14] ViviLouF: asset reuse Zased
[6:44:41] niko_is_bad: Pug tanks in 27s are all legit pussies
[6:45:03] ciraxa: yeah if the tank is dead I’m dead
[6:45:28] niko_is_bad: Double cheat death vdh sounds so counter-intuitive
[6:45:32] ViviLouF: @niko_is_bad keys PauseChamp
[6:46:20] limeoflight: the real loot is the friends we made along the way
[6:46:34] niko_is_bad: sure
[6:47:27] aFlyingGuru: @MightyTeapot it just feels scuffed because yeah, you gain survivability from having another cheat but you lose a lot of survivability as well from not stacking frailty

[7:55:15] gartnerkinderboom: Hey teapot, could you go on reddit and tell the AFK farm complainers that they need to stop begging Anet to fix it, because anet isn't capable of fixing it intelligently, and so the day after the "fix" the farmers will move on to something else, and only legitimate players will be left inconvenienced by whatever implementation anet does :/

[8:22:07] Lanc3qT: This is Blizzard
[8:23:09] Lanc3qT: They have toyed with my feelings enough at least I expect the worst then I can only be surprised.
[8:23:31] Lanc3qT: But I do not think they can see any solution to gold buying beyond the token
[8:23:38] Lanc3qT: Especially since it also makes them money

[8:24:50] Lanc3qT: I am surprised it's profitable to bot in GW2 I checked the gold prices and they are barely competing with the regular gem to gold ratio.
[8:25:13] Howluffu: no corspemaker :(
[8:25:54] Howluffu: the totem <3
[8:26:08] Howluffu: with that cc procc
[8:28:24] limeoflight: osrs/runescape is the most botted game ever and you can buy gold from the devs KEKHeim
[8:28:24] SeriousJester: didnt you buy a wowtoken or 2
[8:28:45] aFlyingGuru: the prices are a lot better which is why people do it
[8:29:16] Lanc3qT: The site I checked on at least they where undercutting gems to gold price by about 10 euro. If you look at wow the undercut way way more
[8:29:31] Lanc3qT: I cba farming in retail
[8:29:36] Lanc3qT: I buy tokens all the time haha

[8:30:49] limeoflight: you should sell mythic fyrakk boosts for gold
[8:30:54] limeoflight: guilds make madddd gold with it
[8:30:55] Lanc3qT: Yeah I mean if the cheapest gold sellers in GW2 undercut the in game one by 10 euro on a 999 gold (which is 4000 gems) I dont understand how it can be profitable how many people are taking the risk to save 10 euro? as I understand it arena net are pretty harsh with gold buying
[8:30:56] StoganNZ: I think the wow token being localised per region will always make it worth it for countries with worse currencies, I think its honestly a real life issue rather than a gaming issue
[8:33:01] Lanc3qT: just be giga blatent sounds like a fun video on like an alt account
[8:33:20] StoganNZ: the runescape venezuela thing was wild if you hadn't heard about that
[8:33:32] Lanc3qT: Is that the same thing as teh wow venezuela thing
[8:33:38] Lanc3qT: where gold was worth more then their currency
[8:34:20] limeoflight: Venezuelan farmers in osrs were making more than doctors in their country and people in game were running around and killing their characters on sight
[8:34:21] limeoflight: OMEGALUL
[8:34:50] Lanc3qT: To be fair I feel bad for them, they live in such a shit show of a country that that is even possible

[8:35:42] Angeels: xdTree
[8:36:00] spruudel: will it be green shroom 1 or 2
