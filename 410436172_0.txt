Lazel puts the game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Fragnance breaks records. Gingi breaks records. Lazel breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic. And his haircut.

[8:43:52] pneumas89: It's not so hard to understand. A lot of class do good AoE damage and ST for push M+, but rogue give also clock, a lot of CC and survi, also they cleave while do ST, War tank have best tank dps and OP AoE, also against melee is Op, druid can do a lot of dps out of healing phase. Monk have strong ST burst and AoE damage, have utility like Ring of peace, dispel who druid don't have and can off heal, also debuff phisical defense of mob (so all the party damage). So why you have to take a DH or war

[10:43:55] woahdudewhat: @Wolfielol I mean, ur looking at the best players in each region for M+, it should not be hard for these groups to learn a different comp to run for M+. Honestly when I mean different comps, I don't mean a full change roster as in a different tank/healer comp each run. It can be a different dps in the group, or limit each person to play the same class X amount of times
