[6:36:56] FERN10919: or you can los cheese it
[6:36:56] VitalityKlitschko: u rotate 3 ppl outside they take debuff then u swap 3 ppl
[6:36:57] Kr0niskTv: cuz of the dmg, otherwise you get 1 shooted
[6:36:59] steezehound: one gets debuff, moves closer than the other group

[6:37:29] Helio_FPS: Y ou don't need to be super far, it only hits 3 people, the 3 furthest away, just have 3 people stand slightly further out, melee at max range and go into boss after the group of 3 gets debuff
[6:37:29] romanisroamin: One group of ranged can do the whole mechanic
[6:37:31] PaEu: ppc in the lair

[7:55:17] joestopfarmingshako: You have to watch threat during the kite with a shaman tank shielded
[7:55:24] Stars69: in front of the room is usually where he's tanked
[7:55:30] Stars69: and ranged just deal w/ the range

[8:08:28] xoxoxoxoxo: peepoOld 10pm is my bedtime
[8:08:29] Dedo_jaha: ppl need to have FAPs in their bags for emergency use, so they don't wipe the raid
[8:08:36] Preemxxx: cheecks clapped
[8:08:38] SanMuki: click=stop bombs spawn
[8:09:16] mlbAct: 1 of 9 ads ????? HOLY FUCKIN SHITTTT
[8:09:19] Swapzz_: more bomb spawns will open up
[8:09:22] Swapzz_: need to close
[8:09:25] felstavd: @Ziqoftw what a PVE andy uare

[8:09:46] mealtiime: @mlbAct ads are the best content
[8:09:51] justOKgaming: you know how to tell where the next bombs will come from? @Ziqoftw
[8:09:52] Swapzz_: boomy should be killing bombs ez
[8:10:00] shloom995: what if there is 2-3?
[8:10:00] Bonzaram: but bombs can spawn on multiple towers if you don't click
[8:10:02] geminuspr: savixFwiends  yep dont click bombs
[8:10:06] lambda__function: test it
[8:10:07] Dedo_jaha: The best 2 PVE streamers are REINVENTING THE WHEEL ATM !
[8:10:13] zak618: ppl will be clicking the other buttons on CD
[8:10:16] nakitaredbeard: @Ziqoftw nature protection potion really helps here, its like up to 2k absorb on lightning dmg from buttons
[8:10:16] frukke23: yes
[8:10:16] justOKgaming: @Ziqoftw look up for next bomb spot
[8:10:25] Trickymaster: not clicking it sounded better
[8:10:31] body_type_two: payoZ
[8:10:31] LanserEU: but if you dont click than later on infinity bombs are coming
[8:10:31] feistygoat37: Every 15 seconds he calls for more bombs and another mouth opens.
[8:10:32] mealtiime: all of the M+ BFA skills are paying their dividends here
[8:10:36] MarkyOchoa: Try the strat
[8:10:42] irlEric: This is what u do: Tank boss at the entrance(far from bombs). The 2 healers sit at the pillars closest to the boss/entrance and click button on CD for mana. Ziqo you do rest of bomb duty> @Ziqoftw
[8:10:47] Stars69: there should only be 1-2 bombs before the pillar gets clicked, and druids can just kill the bomb before it even drops out
[8:10:49] MarkyOchoa: no one's figured out the best way to do it. There might be some hidden tech
[8:10:57] RealDrLing: lebronJAM

[8:41:51] 0N3T0UCH: gun has RANGED attack power tho
[8:41:57] harrisbueller: who got the gun?
[8:42:02] thunderedqt: listen to this goblin
[8:42:02] feistygoat37: They wiped on every boss. some multiple times
[8:42:04] spacecowboyr: the nice part is if you go enough you'll see lots of the epics since its all the boss drops really
