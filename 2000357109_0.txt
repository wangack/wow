[0:05:11] Molvonos: No, I don't believe so.  Though if you're active and play every day, you can take my spot.  I don't play with any regularity due to other games, life, etc.
[0:05:20] Molvonos: And I don't wanna hold the clan back.
[0:07:51] Towelliee: we have 1 spot or 2 if molv said he is not playing

[0:34:51] cyrex172: @Molvonos done gnomes get like so much benefit tho, increased int, escape artist, 15 eng
[0:35:09] cyrex172: hahaa im sorry human mages! it seems i caused offense
[0:35:24] Molvonos: @cyrex172 As a mage, you get blink, so Escape Artist is meh.  In Classic, Spirit's important as well, so it offsets the Int.
[0:35:32] cyrex172: i made a human mage originally, then i read how inferior they were and rerolled
[0:35:34] Molvonos: And if you're not an Engineer, that bonus isn't useful.

[0:36:00] cyrex172: i really dont wanna play gnome if i dont have to...
[0:36:07] Wulfgrym: pve wise i would argue, humans are better than gnomes

[2:04:39] N3llee: and yea I am salty
[2:04:42] Sybexia: Marvin harrison Jr staying at Ohio state
[2:04:43] grimsenvy: paladin is so much fun
[2:04:51] the_bearded_snowman: Think Harrison said he was going to stay at ohio state another year
[2:05:01] SavageCheez: Rumor has it that Harrison has a 20-25M deal to go back to school
[2:05:01] Zuhbuumafu: 30 mill NIL deal offered
[2:05:02] polaropposite76: harrison jr hasn't decided yet... i really can't imagine him staying tho
[2:05:04] Sybexia: 30 million if he stays
[2:05:07] Verdell263: He'll make more NIL his senior year than rookie year
[2:05:11] CodyDaBrodie: them sponsor deals are just as good as nfl money if not better
[2:05:23] Sybexia: NIL
[2:05:25] Donswag3: nah he wont be able to deny the bag he'll get in the NFL
[2:05:27] khaosbeckons: i just want ohtanis contract
[2:05:28] SavageCheez: My guess is the Colts
[2:05:37] Zuhbuumafu: name image likeness
[2:05:41] brutul_: Name image likeness
[2:05:43] Zuhbuumafu: means they get paid to sponsor stuff
[2:05:59] Verdell263: No
[2:06:00] brutul_: There are groups for each team
[2:06:05] grimsenvy: yes
[2:06:05] brutul_: that are set up
[2:06:06] Donswag3: it just refers to player's rights, its governed by the NCAA
[2:06:11] Kratosjr1: money made off the sales from jerseys and team sales
[2:06:12] polaropposite76: top 5 draft pick contract, plus more sponsorships and get your time started so you can get your big payday sooner

[2:06:17] Verdell263: Correct
[2:06:17] Zuhbuumafu: it's a new rule: the players can sell their NIL and sponsor stuff like dealerships and soda brands
[2:06:27] Sybexia: that is the estimate of what he could make if he stays
[2:06:36] Dragunstorm15: No way anybody is making 30 million in college football.  The top person is getting paid 5 million
[2:06:39] brutul_: 4-5 mil
[2:06:40] Hypertitan: there's a rookie cap isn't there??
[2:06:41] Submarine_Mike: yes it was a lawsuit years ago to have to pay college players likeness in games
[2:06:42] Zuhbuumafu: the deal was structured to match his rookie deal
[2:06:42] CodyDaBrodie: Caleb wants part ownership of the team that drafts him as well
[2:06:46] tharieon: I this economy who knows

[2:07:12] TheItalianStallion321: if i was a college athlete getting paid, id stay in college forever
[2:07:13] Sybexia: 700 million to Shohei Ohtani is nuts

[2:07:25] Donswag3: It's a historic deal for a college player reportedly, rivals what a first round pick in the NFL would make
[2:07:26] viciousmeh: I believe USC gave Caleb Williams the highest NIL deal to date... and it was roughly 4 mill for 1 season
[2:07:30] the_bearded_snowman: the dodge dealer in Utah gave every person on the football team a brand new truck this year
[2:07:35] Dragunstorm15: That makes more sense verdell263

[2:08:36] Cidal_: Wear it for the spirit, mana regen
[2:08:41] savvy_gg: NIL has its problem in college sports but what exastorbates  the issue is the transfer portal.
[2:08:53] Zuhbuumafu: bears will trade #1 to pats so htey can get QB, bears take MH Jr.
[2:09:25] DrSoosh: I exastorbated this morning.
[2:09:27] Dragunstorm15: Bears might take a qb lol I don’t know how they feel about fields
[2:09:40] SavageCheez: Pats need a QB as well
[2:09:54] BetsyAndCo: make a bank alt

[2:47:46] Ryuenjin: @LimpyMcGee1 Same. My kitty is sad. I've also done about 40 runs of WC (mostly solo) for the pants. The only time I've seen them drop is when I decided to hop into a group and the guys were carrying a hunter of theirs. He won them at 16 and couldn't even use them.

[2:49:31] Ryuenjin: @grumpy_1969 They have said it will, but they are looking "at options" for what to do with the characters once the season ends. Whether that means we just get dumped to a regular classic server.
[2:49:39] Ryuenjin: Or if we get a new server to keep the runes
[2:49:40] Nerendis: I think SOD is too popular for real

[2:50:47] Ryuenjin: @drewetling Yes, give me alliance shaman. I wish they had done that with SOD. Given us Dwarf shaman and Tauren paladins from the start, would have given more freedrom for runes down the line.
[2:51:28] croooooow: If Ascension WoW wasn't such a...mess I'd have loved to play it longer. So SoD really is helping fill that void it left.
[2:51:52] Ryuenjin: The fact that alliance HAVE to use their druids for windfury while horde doesn't means their kitties get a free rune. Same with alliance getting a free hunter rune since they don't need the kings rune

[3:30:56] LimpyMcGee1: druid rune has no effect if they are under WF totem effect.
[3:30:59] mmrghost7: how do u know they dont stack ?
[3:31:08] Nerendis: Shamans will never use WF totem for real
[3:31:09] shinobro: how is affliction doing rn?? is every 25 lock going META?
[3:31:18] LimpyMcGee1: it says so on teh wild strike rune
[3:31:19] Nerendis: @mmrghost7 Because abilities like that havent stacked for 20 years
[3:31:50] TheItalianStallion321: i hope they make a mage tank rune or something
[3:31:55] shinobro: i thought affliction was doing amazing
[3:32:02] Molvonos: People who've been dickriding for Meta for years are all on SoD and playing it, so there aren't many other warlocks getting invited.
[3:32:07] shinobro: imagine SOUL SWAP rune *kreams*
[3:32:09] trollinmyimp: There's plenty of us. People want us for our summons
[3:32:16] SamuraiWillZ916: when you gonna start bfd?
[3:32:30] Nerendis: "No effect if the part member is already benefitign from Winfury Totem"
[3:33:19] trollinmyimp: Dps suffers form pretty much having to go affliction, which isn't good for mob packs, but destroys bosses.
[3:33:23] Rslsoccer: With bliz adding more tanks options and healer options why not add another class that could summon . ..
[3:33:32] trollinmyimp: it'll be better once we get to levle 40
[3:34:45] DevilSpire: what size is the bfd raid?
[3:34:48] alphabot357: I’ve been so wrapped up in SOD I haven’t done any dungeons this week on retail.

[3:43:58] Nerendis: @Molvonos reeee, i'm more important than anyone else
[3:44:19] The_Yonaz: @Molvonos I'm pretty certain, and positive to the idera, that alot of the tech and ideas from SoD will be in retail in a few expansions
[3:44:25] Nerendis: I love that he starts with "here we go again" like we haven't heard people cry about it for weeks
[3:45:00] gothen123: SOD is retail spells but in classic?
[3:45:04] jason_tacey: @TazIsSum Classic has helped WoW out if anything
[3:45:14] Nerendis: @gothen123 More or less
[3:45:26] shinobro: yeah but we want MOARRRR
[3:45:27] shinobro: lol
[3:45:28] TazIsSum: yall completely took that the wrong way but its ok, keep shitting onme
[3:45:38] Molvonos: @TazIsSum Then explain.

[3:45:52] Nerendis: @TazIsSum You might want to amend your statement then
[3:45:52] mavericks312: Esfand was going off saying they don’t need to add anymore spells to SoD an just add under the hood stuff cause classic players are getting worried
[3:45:54] Tormac1129: ascension way crazier than this
[3:46:01] EpicJune: Ascension went bit more crazy with the runes
[3:46:02] jason_tacey: not shitting bro, relax chill smoke'em if ya got'em
[3:46:18] Se7enthSinn: why not add the retail Quality of Life though?
[3:46:32] jason_tacey: WoW's back baby
[3:46:47] TazIsSum: @Molvonos im talking about how people complaining their new spec cant do what other new specs can do, and just want homogenized classes
[3:46:57] shinobro: just give the META lock immo aura and demonbolt spam aoe, and wer're good right? lol thorgar all over again
[3:47:10] Nowaayjose: @se7enthsinn then play retail?
[3:47:13] gothen123: Will you guys be playing cata?
[3:47:17] SamuraiWillZ916: i love the shit graphics lol
[3:47:23] Molvonos: @TazIsSum Retail's not even that 'homogenized'.  There's clear lines drawn on every tank spec, for example.  Unsure why anyone would make that comparison.
[3:47:28] PixelZen: need to change the nameplate range to 40yds, 20 sucks
[3:47:36] volfan: why not remove raid lockouts all together?
[3:47:41] volfan: or make 24 hours
[3:47:46] gothen123: Unique classes
[3:47:46] Bhoosted: dual spec would be nice
[3:47:51] OviTheGray: add transmog to sod HypeLUL
[3:47:54] futomara01: what we need in classic is groupfinder(not dungeon) new guild/interface ui
[3:47:59] TazIsSum: @Molvonos retail nuance is cosmetic at this point imo, maybe im wrong, but feels like every class as the same buttons with a different name
[3:48:07] Bhoosted: @OviTheGray yesssss
[3:48:07] Se7enthSinn: @Nowaayjose I am playing retail, I watch Tow play this.
[3:48:14] PixelZen: transmog is the only retail feature I really want
[3:48:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Raid lockouts exist to slow players down, that's basically it
[3:48:44] Shammasterj: GUILD BANKS PLSSSSSSS
[3:48:49] Molvonos: @TazIsSum Imma say that's a you thing.  Even in a single class, the specs are wildly different.  Mages/Warlocks, for example.  Frost/Fire/Arcane feel utterly different, same with Demo/Destro/Aff.
[3:48:58] Nowaayjose: @se7enthsinn doesnt play the game yet gives opinion figures out kejw
[3:49:02] Molvonos: Like, I dunno what your headspace is on about in that regard.
[3:49:03] volfan: gotcha, 3 days isnt terrible
[3:49:08] futomara01: group finder chat Works because everyone uses the bulletinboard addon
[3:49:15] Nerendis: @TazIsSum Retail is probably the most diversified it's been in decades
[3:49:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: 3 day lockouts are better than weekly, no doubt
[3:49:33] volfan: if i were bliz, i'd just pay the lfg bulletin board addon creator and make it base
[3:49:34] Nerendis: Judgment
[3:49:39] Maruika: seal and judge lol
[3:49:42] Rslsoccer: auto attacks
[3:49:49] TheItalianStallion321: chat.....hes not lying
[3:49:55] freetherocktv: @Molvonos going to have to disagree here on that. Retail all of the classes have some of the same abilities that other classes have just called something different with a different animation but does the exact same thing.
[3:49:57] TheItalianStallion321: definitely making this more fun. i just got living bomb for mage
[3:50:20] LancerVI: I like the possibility that SoD is linked into the main storyline progression too
[3:50:29] abracka_: @freetherocktv are you high?
[3:50:33] Se7enthSinn: @Nowaayjose I want to play this, but it doesn't fit my lifestyle because everything take too long
[3:50:36] Nerendis: @freetherocktv Just gonna be frank. When is the last time you played multiple retail classes/specs. Because they are so varied at this point you basically have to relearn the class after respeccing
[3:50:38] Molvonos: @freetherocktv I mean, you can disagree.  You're wrong though.  Ultimately, if you really wanna nitpick to hell 'All dps classes do damage, they're all the same'.
[3:51:07] veryhairyheyyall: towLoot
[3:51:11] shinobro: lets be real, we already have alternative timelines so why could this just one of Noz's alt reality's

[3:51:55] Nerendis: There are leaks that Paladins will become Death Knights in SOD
[3:51:59] Nowaayjose: @se7enthsinn bro the max lvl is 25? back too retail you go
[3:52:00] Mecabeast: i think they will give warrior deathgrip
[3:52:05] Nerendis: @Snappole_ It's been out 9 days bro
[3:52:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah someone was saying all retail classes have the same stuff
[3:52:16] abracka_: roar of the wild, pulls all mobs within 15 yards of you to your position
[3:52:21] trollinmyimp: @shinobro I believe that's where they're going with it. We'll get content that explores the "what if's" that could have happened had the retail storyline not happened.

[3:54:27] Molvonos: @freetherocktv And?  The fuck point is that?  My raid doesnt even have shamans, yet we have 3 hunters.  Why should raid composition be locked out behind a class?  You're talking about something completely different than 'all dps feel the same'.

[6:16:44] BigLoe: mage aoe
[6:17:10] Innocentevil: yeah mage should be the aoe healer
[6:17:59] Innocentevil: A trick I did was to use enlightenment which increases your dmg, and when you get low on mana your mana regen
[6:18:08] Innocentevil: and just handle aoe with mass regen
[6:18:24] Rudric_Ice: melee needs to be in max range

[6:35:46] Xara36: I wonder which team will shell out picks for Jake Browning after the year lol
[6:36:47] Tauree25: In last phase if the main tank gets low, he can run a few yards away from the boss so the mind blasts hits another target untill the healers top him off
