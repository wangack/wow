If the foreskin stays in this position, it can cause pain and swelling and can stop blood flow to the penis. This is a serious medical problem and must be treated immediately or there can be long-term damage to the penis, including gangrene.

[4:00:19] bigjerrywilson: Some people have patellar instability, which means that the tendons and ligaments that hold the kneecap in place are already loose and unstable. This might be caused by a previous injury or by another preexisting anatomical condition. An unstable kneecap will dislocate more easily.

[6:11:40] totelol: Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot stretch to allow it to be pulled back past the glans. A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful. Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications. In young boys, it is normal not to be able to pull back the foreskin at all.
