[1:03:47] Purplous: yep!
[1:03:48] gelth: free key
[1:03:55] FuruF: After healing fall, I hate it soo much.
[1:04:00] MasterNewt: :D :D :D
[1:04:02] Sizebot: because you can die 80 times and still time it
[1:04:34] Simkha: Ok but which sand room is more awful, rise or fall?
[1:04:41] KrissyWissy6: the light/dark boss is probably my least favorite boss to heal.
[1:04:42] FuruF: Both
[1:05:36] meezgrind: as someone in a 20 fall right now i hate the dungeon
[1:06:43] REGENAROCKET: Light dark boss is ok, the unfun boss is tyran blob
[1:07:15] KrissyWissy6: someone always fucks up the light/dark boss.
[1:08:01] REGENAROCKET: True
[1:08:17] ren0m: I'm returning to WoW for the first time since early S2. What do I need to do to catch up with gear? Do low lvl M+?
[1:08:55] REGENAROCKET: Superblooms too
[1:09:34] REGENAROCKET: @ren0m
[1:09:38] KrissyWissy6: what talent did you drop? dispell?
[1:09:56] ren0m: That's a new zone?
[1:10:03] KrissyWissy6: ok yeah. dispell
[1:10:06] ren0m: I had iffy gear. Was running 17s-18s
[1:10:11] REGENAROCKET: @ren0m emerald dream yes
[1:10:12] Shrimp37: have you been raiding on druid? I'm played the double life bloom and that's worked well but when I try the germination build I struggle with mana
[1:10:16] BuurmanDeBuurman: all the old hourly world events also drop catch up gear
[1:10:19] ren0m: Ok
[1:10:22] Simkha: There will probably be new catchup gear next patch in a couple of days
[1:10:24] ren0m: And then just craft gear
[1:10:28] ren0m: And straight to M+
[1:10:40] ren0m: I guess I start with 5s or something, to get used to new dungeons.
[1:11:23] ren0m: The biggest pain is setting addons again. It makes me not want to even launch the game :D
[1:13:08] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:13:23] ren0m: And is there iLvL number I should aim for before starting with +10 and above?
[1:15:42] drall743: +9 all the way to +16 is champion gear. the ilvl u need is whatever gets u invites.  gear from +9 goes all the way to 476
[1:16:08] StreamElements: TwitchLit Use your Amazon Prime account for a FREE sub to JB, unlocking  exclusive channel emotes! Terms and info here:  https://twitch.amazon.com/prime TwitchLit
[1:16:36] ren0m: And the crafted gear is what lvl? @moonman743
[1:16:48] ren0m: From the new zone
[1:18:11] SmokeBud24Seven: 486
[1:18:22] ottomr1990: the new crafted gear will be 463 without any crests (which you won't have at start).  if you wait until you have crests to start crafting it'll go up to 486 once you're doing 16s
[1:19:17] ren0m: OK thank you. So I should head over to the new zone, and gear up. Seems easy enough.
[1:19:46] SmokeBud24Seven: SmokeBud24Seven watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[1:20:55] REGENAROCKET: Gearing is easy it just requires playing the game, many different ways
[1:21:32] ren0m: I just didn't know where to start as it felt like I have 6 months of catching up to do.
[1:22:05] REGENAROCKET: Yeah its a lot
[1:22:39] BuurmanDeBuurman: Clueless idk boss seems pretty easy to me
[1:22:52] Simkha: Only 2 mechs, ez fight

[1:25:23] Simkha: Man playing these 2 dungeons as fire is really annoying bucause SKB falls off between every pull for running/rp
[1:26:08] Simkha: Then again Im bad, so
[1:28:35] FuruF: I'm pretty sure whoever designed this dungeon just hates healers
[1:29:45] SmokeBud24Seven: never seen JB get heated :D
[1:31:32] SmokeBud24Seven: he was about to slap someone :D
[1:32:53] SmokeBud24Seven: yahh i hear you lil sneak stuff be pissing me off too lol

[2:55:22] LionWhyte1103: Wait is this BRH? WHy does it look brighter?
[2:56:35] TheSiliconDon: In a healing use case does the person targeted w/ Convoke matter in terms of how much they receive?
[2:56:54] TheSiliconDon: @LionWhyte1103 There's a potion for that
[3:00:01] zzugelder: surprised they let stacks fall
[3:01:14] LionWhyte1103: @TheSiliconDon I forgot there were potions for that

[3:45:18] mrcritex: KEKW
[3:45:23] bonjourdaisy: What's with the fall hate
[3:45:46] jenkinsdonuttv: It really is a weird dungeon boss
[3:45:53] jenkinsdonuttv: Feels almost like a trunkated raid boss
[3:45:59] Nerdhino: yeah but last boss is fun as dps KEKW
[3:46:01] Swizzy06: yea that stuff is ass
[3:46:10] TBouse: the trash is definitely incredibly bad design
[3:46:14] zzugelder: chrono burst is terrible with no room
[3:46:44] Svesno: I do
[3:46:45] jenkinsdonuttv: That flying between platforms is obnoxious as heck
[3:46:45] tweed_13: all the rp shit in dungoen triggers me
[3:46:51] zzugelder: its cool for the first time but not over and over
[3:46:52] mrcritex: KEKW 󠀀
[3:46:54] Nerdhino: also nvm the map being totally useless LuL
[3:46:57] losttobaldness: Dragon Pog

[3:47:32] jenkinsdonuttv: It's dogshit for replayability
[3:47:33] GnarstyTV: jdotBASED
[3:48:00] caradea_: dont need to see the fyrakk intro video any more in my life
[3:48:07] YdenTV: Gives a spires vibe
[3:48:37] jenkinsdonuttv: Even then they made the elevator better than before
[3:48:39] Svesno: Do you think there is a person who watches it every time they do that dungeon?
[3:48:44] jenkinsdonuttv: It's still better than the dragons thing
[3:49:49] MangoMafioso: BRH is the worst
[3:49:52] MangoMafioso: Just staring at a wall
[3:50:38] Blackgoose25: I hate all these dungeon cut scenes and time delays
[3:50:41] kelly_mac06: they did such a great job of getting rid of CERTAIN RP parts but like why did they not get rid of them all
[3:50:44] kelly_mac06: so dumb
[3:51:04] TBouse: but you'd have to heal double dragons immediately after 2nd boss Kappa
[3:51:09] zzugelder: its only popular due to the friendly timer
[3:51:20] zanis_: Can I see your OVerall DPS breakdown ?
[3:52:31] TBouse: if the 1st pull didnt exist he wouldnt like it
[3:52:32] ImJoshingYou: F that DHT is my favorite :)
[3:52:33] redapples28: you also have 2 bosses where you have to clear all trash before they spawn
[3:52:45] Wiigglles: my team mates like fall and i hate it
[3:52:47] BuurmanDeBuurman: max has dumb opinions all the time
[3:52:52] Blackgoose25: the 2nd boss of fall is designed so badly
[3:52:59] Nerdhino: I want more 3 boss dungeons that take 20 minutes instead of these shit 30-40 minute dungeons
[3:53:00] Devingz: having a rogue and a mage has made me force myself to like fall
[3:53:01] Wiigglles: i think fall is definitely a healer hated dungeon
[3:53:03] Blackgoose25: max has the worst takes sometimes
[3:53:27] ImJoshingYou: rise just feels like it takes a eternity to complete
[3:54:29] Zarentina: im an NA brain and can't see the hats on Morchie, its so hard for me lol
[3:54:42] BuurmanDeBuurman: bad news
[3:54:43] BuurmanDeBuurman: they will
[3:54:44] Hoflax24: I'm convinced next season will just be all the dragonflight dungeons again
[3:54:46] TBouse: have you not mentioned the 20 minute last boss yet
[3:54:48] Nerdhino: na you'll get all 8 OG dragonflight dungeons and you'll like it!
[3:54:49] Ciqq: wdym we played de other side for 3 seasons in a row
[3:54:57] zzugelder: probably a non healer take
[3:54:59] JethroTroll: <3 Fall
[3:55:00] zanis_: I mean I really like it on DPS but hate it on Healer
[3:55:05] Svesno: I actually like fall. It is ok. Rise 1st on my hate list
[3:55:05] Rottee: i think rise and fall are both shit
[3:55:31] Vinotteglie: As a tank, I love Fall, its very easy to tank
[3:55:32] Nerdhino: I'm a warlock, so that's not a problem KEKW
[3:55:35] zebajin: i like it coz my BIS weapons drop there =D'
[3:55:40] DaCheF111: there is a mechanic where you have to jump to bug it out lmao
[3:55:43] ImJoshingYou: fall is alright if you can handle the chain pulling
[3:55:44] zanis_: It's a strong mechanic check dungeon - not very forgiving in certain areas.
[3:55:46] fusion2102: i think because the timer is so free you can still time it with like 15 deaths
[3:56:08] StreamElements: TwitchLit Use your Amazon Prime account for a FREE sub to JB, unlocking  exclusive channel emotes! Terms and info here:  https://twitch.amazon.com/prime TwitchLit
[3:56:13] BayanY: In fall you can die 30x and still time it. So people dont remember the deaths
[3:56:23] zanis_: I don't think thats true - at lesat in higher keys on 2nd boss
[3:56:35] lizardo221: I think for most people, they don't experience the dungeon on a high level of difficulty where these problems come into play.
[3:56:44] Hoflax24: There's this really strange sentiment in a lot of games where people think that because a boss is easy, its inherently good
[3:56:47] Hoflax24: I see it all the time in souls games
[3:56:50] zanis_: You need to be in dark to help out your healer at the right time.
[3:56:52] Vinotteglie: as a tank the only thing that could put me into trouble in FALL, is the stacking debuff timeslice on first pack
[3:57:10] nailb0mb: just live ez
[3:57:32] Vinotteglie: and bloom, that hurts
[3:58:20] Blackgoose25: I hate when a party member gets bloom and tainted sands at the same time
[3:58:23] Blackgoose25: if no dispel its death
[3:58:32] TBouse: it's not overturned it's just bad design. the dots are both
[3:58:36] Silentfeety: do we have like a haste cap for raid or just to stack as much as i can?
[3:59:01] clid3422: what dot
[3:59:03] kelly_mac06: we need a lap counter to track all the times JB's little birb has run around that fountain
[3:59:18] Blackgoose25: tainted sand on 2 ppl is so aids
[3:59:46] Nerdhino: we had 23 deaths in a +23 + a 460ilvl player and still +2 that dungeon LuL
[3:59:51] clid3422: improved regrowth spam
[4:00:04] Hoflax24: Easy does not equal good FeelsDankMan
[4:00:37] uhhhhyeayoo: timers haven’t mattered all of dragonflight. kinda weird
[4:00:40] MangoMafioso: It's "tolerable" suffering
[4:00:49] Nerdhino: @uhhhhyeayoo cap
[4:01:00] Vinotteglie: @uhhhhyeayoo ever heard of Azure Vaults?
[4:01:13] trixoncd: what add-on is that for showing who the leader is and what dps is in the key?
[4:01:19] vetyl: Rise and maybe TotT are only dungeons w/ relevant timers imo
[4:01:20] BayanY: Do rise and throne and say timer doesnt matter
[4:01:21] uhhhhyeayoo: after nerfs?

[4:03:35] uhhhhyeayoo: @vetyl your telling me you get to ozumat 0 deaths and your out of time. meanwhile people timing throne 27+ with 20+ deaths sooo…
[4:03:36] DaCheF111: imagine the civilians trying to get into keys
[4:03:41] DaCheF111: we need solo q
[4:04:08] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:04:20] BayanY: Uhh you have to do crazy pulls to get the timer and so deaths are more likely doesnt mean timer is free

[4:05:45] Nerdhino: Toxic D:
[4:06:44] uhhhhyeayoo: @bayany I’m sure having for alive is good for the timer. good logic.
[4:07:02] uhhhhyeayoo: four*
[4:07:11] lizardo221: I wish there was a way to play around dispeling the dot on the slower pizza slice. Give you an alternative strat. I can only think of a lot of teloporting and high movement speed.
[4:07:28] Celissah: Would tainted rageheart and blossom of amirdrassil be a good combo for a starter to heal and then switch  later on from blossom? I got both in HC.
[4:08:36] lizardo221: Maybe you warlock gate a set? And then alternate to personals on a fast set?
[4:09:02] Cuttusk: the wild charge fly to an enemy always hit ground effects for me

[4:09:17] Hoflax24: Its really annoying that the on use trinkets are so good and the passive trinkets are so bad
[4:09:26] DangerSlope: The timer on rise is so tight, do u think there will be another round of nerf?
[4:09:26] Hoflax24: Its just an unfun playstyle, for dps at least
[4:09:36] shulmatt: I've got a 476 blossom and it does 12% of my healing in 20s
[4:10:09] Blackgoose25: I have a 489 blossom it does insane healing but I feel like i already do a lot of healing and dont need it
[4:10:12] zebajin: nothing about M+ trinket farm is easy
[4:10:34] zebajin: i have done prob around 30 BRH never seen the agi/ver trinket drop even

[4:11:37] BayanY: @uhhhhyeayoo if you hace to do insane pulls and play the key perfectly and have the max timed key be 2 lower and the timer still being tight does not make it an easy timer.
[4:11:59] Hoflax24: JB are you ok
[4:12:05] lizardo221: Chad the dk who keeps telling you about his time in the Stormwind Army.
[4:12:11] Nerdhino: and when the tank dies you become Amos Diggory?
[4:15:09] uhhhhyeayoo: @bayany the fact that people are doing title keys in throne with 20+ deaths lead me to believe you have no idea what the fuck your talking about
[4:15:54] Carameldasen: I hope this week i can get that fyrakk trinket. The shield would be so nice on some mechs. i am so use to clicking into bear form for any dmg going out lol

[4:30:13] jenkinsdonuttv: Just came back from a fall (which disbanded after 2 wipes on Iridikron). I concur once again with your statements about this dog dungeon xdd

[4:32:06] flawlesslykun: jb i was replying to some1 yesterday that u should press dispell on bursting but i never see u do it actualy KEKW
[4:32:27] BayanY: Gave up before finishing but was probably a few minutes behind. Im not saying the timer isnt doable. Its just you cant say the timer is non existant in key thats 2 levels lower than other keys and the pulls you are doing are dog shit espcially without a vengeance.
[4:34:30] xjacobtv: That's a ballsy pull lol
[4:35:27] cajovysacok: cant you just line this barage
[4:35:57] uhhhhyeayoo: @bayany idk, until you lose to timer with 0 deaths. hard to say that the issue timer and not the damage of crushing depths or focused tempest or flame shock

[4:36:53] justbeachi: idk how it's somehow harder than rise

[4:37:32] Vinotteglie: ive timed it on 26 and have a 28 tott but would like a 27 first to sharpen my selfconfidence
[4:37:45] nikozree: do u play any resto shaman in high keys?
[4:38:11] MangoMafioso: The cursed dungeon for me this week is Everbloom, it doesn't even feel hard but groups just fall apart

[4:38:28] nikozree: we dont play with fury warriors
[4:38:43] BayanY: @uhhhhyeayoo yea i agree other fucked up shit is going to get you before the timer in most scenarios but the fact that you have to deal with the random deaths i consider part of the timer because we cant change that.
[4:38:54] Vinotteglie: @MangoMafioso ive had so many pugs die on the last boss of EB this week because they do NOT respect the fight. 'it's fort, i didnt think i was gonna die'

[5:58:12] IveRelapsed: they don't play wow often but it does offer a reason to buy the game. it's a massive month-long advertisement that blizzard doesn't have to pay for.
[5:58:18] flawlesslykun: with the shit i see in pugs ? raiding and keys ? no shot. i agree jb
[5:58:26] qinec: i think loads of people who watch the race are just old wow gamers who watch it out of nostalgia

[5:59:15] IveRelapsed: lmfao nah 99% of people watching rwf are doing it because of the eu vs na thing
[5:59:26] weezie_61: I dont understand why people even watch RWF. I mean everyone is just farming deaths for 14 hours a day. it is a joke.
[5:59:29] Hawkins_JJ: rwf always makes me want to re-join after a hiatus. can’t imagine it draws new people in
[6:00:19] IveRelapsed: there isn't any reason because it's free advertisement right now and any interference from them would a.) make it worse and b.) remove the free part of the free advertisement
[6:00:27] WytherOK: the raids just seem so needlessly complicated
[6:00:54] KoRezaN: i myself skipped entirity of 9.1 and 9.2 even though i watched whole races. Being interested in the race doesnt equal wanting to play it at all, im not buying sub til i know the game is in good state and race says nothing about it
[6:01:13] Kemplore: If the RWF mattered to bliz then they would do it 4 times a year to pump their profits
[6:01:40] IveRelapsed: who's to say they don't?
[6:01:49] IveRelapsed: this last race was p good
[6:02:02] lizardo221: I think it does very, very little. A single youtube trailer with an epic battle does magnitudes more for something like marketing.
[6:02:33] IveRelapsed: i'll agree that it's one of those things that's a floating target that changes based on circumstances that are impossible to predict
[6:02:35] FuruF: Honestly, I would imagine it would bring in people, but not for long. Other games have similar events that do draw in more people for short periods. I highly doubt it is millions of players, but a good enough bump.
[6:02:44] Hawkins_JJ: jb do you ever regret your career choice moving away from white collar work?
[6:02:45] IveRelapsed: but that's part of what makes the race fun imo
[6:03:11] tweed_13: @weezie_61 I do. I enjoy the progress raiders do at highest possible level. knowing I will never get there. plus it's a race to a point like a ball game so to say.
[6:03:13] Iamelele: Unless the idea of the raid being hard leads to selling more tokens for boosts, don't see how watching splits for half the time then wipes for the rest is any good advertisement for anyone
[6:03:14] lizardo221: I think events are largely for retaining current users, not drawing new ones.

[7:40:46] Fortearmure: spending hiurs in que rn to get into one 27...
[7:41:36] fundersaam: @Fortearmure same its fucking useless, everyone just wants the supermeta classes when most are just fine.
[7:43:00] aarseths: why would anyone invite non meta classes for a 27
[7:43:27] matchdo: cus it’s not needed
[7:43:41] fundersaam: its 100% not needed and I do plenty of damage as is
[7:43:46] aarseths: yes but its easier, anyone invites meta cause you can choose
[7:43:59] Entelligenz: tbf many things are considered meta rn imo
[7:44:08] aarseths: EVERYONE, nobody does not go for meta so everyone is guilty of what everyone complains about xd

[7:44:09] ostblocklatino23: bro can you say me stats for heal monk in m+?
[7:44:11] cajovysacok: because non meta class players is so good in non meta clas
[7:44:12] bonjourdaisy: isn't this the best ssn for lack of a meta? I swear any class gets invites at 26ish keys
[7:44:16] fundersaam: na, dh+mage+warlock+aug
[7:44:20] fundersaam: thats about it
[7:44:59] lizardo221: I'll say at lower levels, you quickly find aug specifically a risk that you are typically better off inviting something else, but the higher you go, the more you must take it.
[7:45:04] matchdo: ppl aren’t looking beyond the first one of raider io timed keys. more classes are meta than mage Aug and boomy dh
[7:45:38] ihass: I love real explaining 😂
[7:45:48] lizardo221: I'm refering to many aug's being hard to judge if they are good or performing well during the key
[7:46:37] matchdo: three Mets healers. prob 8-9 Mets or slightly sub meta dps.
[7:48:14] Lashga: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys  Guess whos back
