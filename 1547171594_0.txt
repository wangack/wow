[1:17:37] itsrambo: ppl might be able to farm old content faster, good thing they don't allow that
[1:17:39] moa285: Who asked..? It's the same fucking story everytime.
[1:17:39] zgag: It's a 5min cd.  I really didn't see any reason that it needed to be nerfed
[1:17:48] CrniOrao: They're upgrading to 410% from 310%?
[1:17:51] DeanoTV: so stupid
[1:17:57] Skars111: this makes no sense what so ever bad nerf
[1:18:04] Holysal: @manmower no reason to nerf it when it has a cd
[1:18:04] Wolfenhoof: Dragonflying they already fucked up enough considering the feedback. People loved it in the first build, was a sure thing that this is too much fun. To much fun is not good for blizz.
[1:18:09] Eregbueye: advantage in pet battles Pog
[1:18:10] Elendayer: @CrniOrao 310 +100 base
[1:18:17] Shredx: I heard mage talents are disappointing
[1:18:18] reggiepowa: it should be even lower tbh, zandalari have a basic ass glider on a 15 min cd and people are mad that evokers can't go at 900% jesus
[1:18:18] Archrade: This is actually good
[1:18:25] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:18:30] flebbooo: yeah and it was aweeeesome
[1:18:33] cptrogers123: LET US HAVE FUUUUNNN PLS
[1:18:35] Finiin: some people are saying it was a tech issue in the old zones
[1:18:39] itsrambo: give everyone a move speed ability, fun achieved
[1:18:39] Excy: I'm really pissed, I was planning on using the massive soar speed to fly between pet battles for the most efficient exp gain per hour and they've destroyed it
[1:18:39] Holysal: @Eregbueye nah they fly too fast so the pet wouldnt even render LUL
[1:18:40] Warzam: its such a bad nerf, just make the rest fun instead of hamstering
[1:18:42] moa285: So.. what? They should allow all dragonflying. This doesn't make any sense.
[1:18:44] looney199725: why are they talking out there ass if they didnt want op racials why do they have 2 cc in there racial still
[1:18:48] Ezekyler: make flight point to point faster Kappa

[1:18:56] Archrade: This is a good fix
[1:19:01] xendros78: seems like they forgot about druid flight form's advantages
[1:19:03] luckfore: its still fast af
[1:19:04] Skars111: why does it matter though what benefit do they get from doing that? completeing a old irelevant quest or pet battle quicker than you?
[1:19:06] manmower: they should have restricted it to only areas where dragonriding is allowed
[1:19:06] Warzam: who the fuck cares about flying speeds anyway? This is just BLizz being anti-fun
[1:19:14] cabalish: np towLove
[1:19:17] reggiepowa: they need it to nerf it more, still too much
[1:19:17] moa285: Kappa
[1:19:19] Molvonos: @looney199725 Because Racial Skills and Class skills are one in the same for the Evokers.  Completely different.
[1:19:38] looney199725: soar is a racial just like the 2 cc options
[1:19:39] zgag: Hunters had a bug where when using target marking would pull the boss.  It took Blizzard 2-3 months to fix.  A class that can use a cd for extra speed needs a nerf right away
[1:19:48] Devildriver007: only problem I seee is Warmode
[1:19:50] zgag: lol
[1:19:52] Funderik: the change isn't a big deal, to me atleast, it's fun either way.  asmon made a good point, it might be a change cus of their bot flying detection system and x speed.
[1:19:55] cptrogers123: but its fun :(
[1:20:00] FeralLikeMe: it's a change that's not needed at all
[1:20:05] akia03: is soar useable in bgs and such
[1:20:09] itsrambo: objective based WPVP = gg
[1:20:09] looney199725: the 2 cc racials are more broken than being able to soar every 5 mins
[1:20:12] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[1:20:14] liftedinxinfinity: BabyRage more speed
[1:20:25] Archrade: After fix Drachthyr soar is like 1.5x faster than epic flying.
[1:20:31] moa285: another pointless change
[1:20:34] zgag: It's a 5min cd.  Blizzard should focus on stuff that is actually important
[1:20:35] GiraffeHydra_: Gotta go fast
[1:20:45] manmower: they're gonna be nerfing dracthyr for years
[1:20:50] Rudric_Ice: the soar nerf made me realize that they still didn't change and they might fuck it up like torghast in SL alpha
[1:21:00] cptrogers123: no
[1:21:01] Funderik: it will have more changes no doubt, they might half the CD on it .
[1:21:02] KaisenSiru: Long term health of the game
[1:21:21] LearnedSomething: it was 950% fun before
[1:21:24] cptrogers123: We get it, but we dont want it :(
[1:21:25] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:21:26] Molvonos: It's going from Very Fast to just Fast.
[1:21:31] itsrambo: once its OP just go full send
[1:21:31] Molvonos: It's really not that big a deal
[1:21:34] foxxys856: i mean lets be real its not like there a mage who can instant go to any main city with the click of 1 button
[1:21:37] Skars111: how is it overpowered though lol?
[1:21:38] looney199725: for long term health of game change dracthyr racials to remove the 2 cc options

[1:21:42] liftedinxinfinity: people will complain over anything now  a days lmao
[1:21:46] manmower: when they add dragonriding to all zones they can buff it back
[1:21:47] Archrade: Ifthis fix  not declared I bet none would even realize this change
[1:21:48] TheItalianStallion321: LUDICROUS SPEED
[1:21:50] imbatree: there is no reason to nerf "being op in outdoor traveling" like wtf
[1:21:50] Eviltuna13: people would still go aps shit if they nerfed it by 1%
[1:21:51] Ploxboxx: Ifs a pvp advantage...just disable it while in combat?
[1:21:52] moa285: There are a thousand better ways to solve this. ...that is... if it was a real and genuine problem.
[1:21:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: meanwhile dark iron dwarves get to mining drill across the world
[1:21:55] flebbooo: The speed change i don't mind, i just can't behind not being able to do it other non Dragon isle zones
[1:22:04] Funderik: my question is.. if it was 630% at the start of alpha, would those same people be crying they need to buff it to 910%? NOPE
[1:22:13] PvtHudson093: They've gone Plaid
[1:22:15] looney199725: changing soar should be low prio for them rn they need to get the trees in a good spot
[1:22:19] zgag: People are forgetting that it's a 5 min cd.  If it was something like 1-3 min cd i could see the issue
[1:22:24] Wolfenhoof: For Dragonflying they will make it as annoying as possible for release, so you can work half a year on skills that will restore the fun it was in the first alpha build i would guess.
[1:22:39] itsrambo: 30 min CD, 2000% speed

[1:22:40] zgag: It's an overreach of something that's not a huge deal
[1:22:47] Rudric_Ice: so u agree with the change tow ?
[1:22:57] looney199725: no one complained that soar was to fast tho lmao
[1:23:00] moa285: The bluepost literally makes no sense whatsoever.
[1:23:05] looney199725: evoker got buffed pretty much
[1:23:14] looney199725: no they got buffed
[1:23:17] looney199725: evoker dps got buffed
[1:23:18] EclipserEU: thats communication for you
[1:23:19] Skars111: it lame excuse though? who cares if someone gets to a pet battle quicker than you or completes and old world content quest quicker than you
[1:23:24] Tripnbunz: they are doing much better
[1:23:29] iloveyalunn: People will still say Blizz bad
[1:23:33] Mattsta: the post was mostly just smoothing out their tree
[1:23:34] luckfore: read it FeelsGoodMan
[1:23:34] Rudric_Ice: imagine nerfing soar for OLD CONTENT LMAO
[1:23:39] Molvonos: @looney199725 Man, you are unhealthily fixated on those.  There are just as many CCs in other classes (Sheep, Frost Nova, Dragon's Fire, Blastwave, Slow, using your favorite classes own CCs).  They're Class Abilities, homie.
[1:23:49] looney199725: yes
[1:23:52] looney199725: but there not racials
[1:24:02] DeanoTV: @Rudric_Ice trueee
[1:24:08] Rudric_Ice: they should remove mage portals if they think like that
[1:24:16] Molvonos: towTinfoil
[1:24:20] zgag: It was the same thing that happened with the water strider. Where people in Legion complained that those with water strider got to the quest's quicker.  Think thing you know water strider was nerfed
[1:24:31] zgag: Next *
[1:24:50] looney199725: blue build is the best atm
[1:24:54] Wolfenhoof: @looney199725 you get all those on top of the 2 racials, even as someone who doesn't plays arean i can understand the problem there
[1:25:18] Wolfenhoof: i mean i don't give a fuck because i don't play arena, but still^^
[1:25:31] Molvonos: @zgag And yet they gave Inflated Hoofplates to everyone who did got the water strider before the nerf, making it *not a nerf* and more a *use the mount you want instead of being pigeonholed into the waterstrider*
[1:25:39] moa285: racist tree SeemsGood
[1:25:56] looney199725: blizz should be focused on talent trees not messing with soar that has no effect on anything
[1:26:21] Molvonos: Apparently Blizzard can only work on one single thing at any given time.  towSip
[1:26:30] Skars111: Racial perks have literally defined metas. Also, Dracthyr / Evoker is in a unique situation. The spell could easily be a class spell and it would change nothing. It’s a one to one relationship. You can not really compare it to existing races in the game.
[1:26:37] Rudric_Ice: its ok blizzard is listening to feedback guys
[1:27:33] looney199725: the part you dont full empower is blue eternity surge
[1:27:33] Hiyde: Hiyde subscribed with Prime. 
[1:27:36] looney199725: on st u 1 charge
[1:27:38] looney199725: aoe full charge
[1:27:52] Puns_Blazing: If its something like number of targets increase - but yeah thats spell design if they dont want us to always do rank 3 @Towelliee
[1:28:05] looney199725: everyone has already said evoker dps is braindead
[1:28:11] looney199725: the healer spec has the skill cap
[1:28:16] moa285: Soar should have removed CD and made it a full version of dragonflying.  .. It's always like that. There's the potential for something cool in a game, then some dumbass at Blizzard comes along and says... Hmm, what are we gonna fuck up today?
[1:29:33] ttvlevelis: @moa285 i dont agree with this at all with no cd they just own the world pvp witch would be dumb
[1:30:02] looney199725: who cares about wow pvp tho

[1:30:40] looney199725: not world pvp
[1:31:04] moa285: @powerlevs You couldn't have given a stupider answer, sorry. .. I don't know if it can be used in combat, but it shouldn't and no one was even talking about that.
[1:31:34] Wolfenhoof: @moa285 stop trolling or go home, you're drunk
[1:31:48] Sollice: I am doing a dungeon
[1:31:51] Sollice: do i need to stop
[1:31:58] moa285: @Wolfenhoof PogO
[1:32:18] Molvonos: Papa Sol's gonna turn this dungeon around.

[1:32:47] instant_savage: this alpha is way different then shadowlans they didnt listen at all
[1:32:49] KaisenSiru: Pog
[1:32:52] abracka_: bobby the goblin
[1:33:24] llNoTToXiCll: Thats a really good change i really hope WoW can come back stronger one can only hope COPIUM

[1:34:50] abracka_: glance at the shaman trees

[1:35:27] mashiesmashie: dont suppose you saw my Tweet about checking to make sure your roster is compliant?
[1:35:34] itsrambo: the last class tree is coming out 2 weeks after all the others, wonder who is unlucky one
[1:35:42] fistofnature: my only fear is that it will feel like im playing a lesser class/spec because a lot of abilities that are baseline are now a talent that you need to take
[1:35:49] The_Dane_Train: When are they going to make interrupts baseline?
[1:36:00] Wolfenhoof: @itsrambo my bet is DH
[1:36:10] Puns_Blazing: Warr / Monk / Lock i can't wait to see. I hope they are not a big of a disaster as mage trees 🙏
[1:36:42] credit525: elegy

[1:37:22] strike879: it does make sense for questing do you really want to drop totems for each mob
[1:37:27] LordVader83: @looney199725 are you going to know if they took it tho?
[1:37:29] The_Dane_Train: Great now not only can my pug dps not know how to bind their interrupts now they won’t have it at all.

[1:38:03] Puns_Blazing: @looney199725 Well depends, some classes its not worth the investment to get the kick. For example boomies can get a lot more different utility and off-heals if they don't go for skull bash

[1:39:16] dwolters_the_zombieman: is this towelliees addons
[1:39:18] Skars111: is there a way to send feedback to blizz if not being on the alpha also meaning you cant post in the alpha forums    how can you send them feedback?

[1:40:04] llNoTToXiCll: @MuzkaTV  try retail Bug reporter maybe
[1:40:07] mashiesmashie: LOLLLL
[1:40:17] Tyllaniell: what do you think of the dracthyr racial fly speed nurf? should it be blatantly nurfed, or keep it the same and add higher skill cap ceiling to utilize it to the fullest - like the faster you go the controls go tighter, and it gets easier to crash if you mess up? Asking because in comparison to mount fly you can't just set direction on auto and leave it. it requires your attention and manual input to Soar.
[1:40:18] gnarfarm: We are not on the same faction

[2:07:52] manmower: staff meeting notes

[2:07:56] Razmasbear: patch notes are out so you can go and read them

[2:11:11] llNoTToXiCll: not redo it
[2:11:18] soge131: YEP
[2:11:22] slowfetch: the pure pain ones
[2:11:27] Razmasbear: Uldaman is still there, legacy of tyr is separe from it
[2:11:38] aikopooh: time sink dung always there
[2:11:56] soge131: I dont hate 1 40min dungeon in the pool, as long as it's one and not all of them
[2:12:22] Warcraftthor: sucks that we have to go there for it and theres not a "secret" entrance on the Dragon isles
[2:12:22] Tharia: lol
[2:12:24] CommanderKrano: way better that they keep the old dungeon too. its always the worst when they remove old content to recycle it
[2:12:28] itjustfeelsright: they so good though
[2:12:34] itjustfeelsright: the pictures and stuff inside it
[2:12:39] Wolfenhoof: SL never happened.
[2:12:48] manmower: once the time bandits come out they can explain away all the bad canon stuff
[2:12:48] Jokervenom1978: You smell like beef and cheese!
[2:12:50] LeXieSterling: Nothing. It's like GOT the book writer doesn't have much to do with the show.
[2:12:51] Elff11: The shadowlands are actually in the chronicles
[2:13:00] Larc9783: "Canon? No, it's more of a....guideline"
[2:13:03] generaljosh721: They should have just had the portal pop up a menu that lets you pick which one instead of having two dungeons
[2:13:03] akia03: can you make crossfaction guilds on alpha?
[2:13:04] Elff11: Atleast from the map
[2:13:06] Thunderbrew: One of the great things about FF!4, the story is air tight. Don't have to read a novel to get part of the story.
[2:13:12] brian_777777777: they are chilling man
[2:13:15] Shaeli: it was a multi year fever dream......
[2:13:16] Krait06: It was all a Nzoth vision
[2:13:23] Molvonos: Everything post Pandaria was a coke-fueled fever dream
[2:13:23] soge131: We ascended Pelagos into the Pantheon of Death, we've quite literally forged a titan monkaS
[2:13:25] Razmasbear: My headcanon that whole Shadowlands was shenanigans of N'zoth
[2:13:26] Mitune: I really hope they do say that the SL isnt the real death just the thing the first ones made to create anima for power to do something else.
[2:13:30] brian_777777777: it's all a vibe borpaSpin
[2:13:39] slowfetch: have to read several novels in game though
[2:13:54] TheCliffyShow: If WoD didn't happen, then Legion didn't happen.
[2:13:57] slowfetch: i know it was a joke
[2:14:04] zenohold: They are trying to tell you that ff14 is the best, kick em out!
[2:14:12] h116_: ye but what he's saying is that the FF story is all in the game, wow isn't

[2:14:24] backstreetalright: Reading is healthy
[2:14:28] aikopooh: arr was such a slow burner
[2:14:32] RadRage69: idk i had fun in SL , i started playing wow late BFA , for me is my first expansion and i had fun tbf , achieved a cool goal this season got to 3515 RIO as hpriest
[2:14:33] Dankind64: Yeah. The FF story is in the game, as opposed to novels outside the game
[2:14:34] foxies_havocing: @Towelliee what do you think of Dragonflight for now?
[2:14:37] xReadyAimMissx: draenor never happened? *looks at new character they are specifically leveling through the draenor story line* danSpy
[2:14:43] unsolved_return: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on ret this early on so far mate
[2:15:00] dwolters_the_zombieman: from cata to sl none of it happened lol
[2:15:17] Larc9783: Is that a Corgi version of a dragon
[2:15:17] Sollice: Could the Shadowlands literally of happened and it would not affect things in DF?
[2:15:22] Sollice: Story wise
[2:15:24] Sovekz: Can I check the new talent trees somewhere?
[2:15:26] Priatus: just imagine the first DF mission all the characters woke up in their respective cities, stormwind and orgrimmar in a bed with an npc next to them saying they were in a coma for 2 years
[2:15:37] unsolved_return: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on ret this early on so far mate
[2:15:40] dalaraz: @Sovekz wowhead
[2:15:42] Sollice: I am trying to think if there is anything MAJOR coming from SL. Time skip? People have gotten older and married?
[2:15:46] Molvonos: @Sollice I believe so, unless they install NPCs from Shadowlands in zones we dont have access to
[2:16:01] Sovekz: @dalaraz Ty
[2:16:04] unsolved_return: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on ret this early on so far mate?
[2:16:07] Razmasbear: There are two clar references of timeskip
[2:16:22] Molvonos: There are NPCs from Exile's Reach in Dragonflight, which is kinda amazing
[2:17:02] unsolved_return: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on ret this early on so far mate
[2:17:11] ijuki: Wait, what?
[2:17:15] ijuki: Who is married to who?
[2:17:15] TheItalianStallion321: its Steve Irwin lol
[2:17:15] SpeedyBread: sgvigiKEKWS sgvigiKEKWS
[2:17:17] ijuki: monkaS
[2:17:23] Sollice: Thats not a knife
[2:17:23] manmower: nah that's just Art
[2:17:24] brian_777777777: did wrathion really stab nzoth anyway
[2:17:29] TheCliffyShow: @Larc9783 I wish one of those existed. You know what they save about corgi hybrids? They look like corgi's with the other breeds head. Imagine that with a corgi /dragon hybrid
[2:17:31] itjustfeelsright: should have been art vandalay
[2:17:33] Ferothen: the chopper loll
[2:17:37] generaljosh721: Is that a tiger king reference
[2:17:55] Razmasbear: N'Zoth could have messed with us and SL was just his ultimate nightmare
[2:17:59] Wolfenhoof: I wonder if they married Baine and Mayla as well or if they mark Baine as gay finally. We tauren need something done about our leadership. We all know how fast a horde leader can die.
[2:18:08] Armdel: any harrison jones sighting?
[2:18:16] TheCliffyShow: Steve Irwin didn't die. He just went back to his home planet of Azeroth.
[2:18:28] SpeedyBread: Butterfingers
[2:18:36] zgag: Looking at the Alpha forums Blizzard is getting blasted with the resent Dragon Flight changes
[2:18:36] Larc9783: Hemmet is Allain Quartermain now? lul
[2:18:46] TheCliffyShow: Best name for a chef ever.
[2:18:49] unsolved_return: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on ret this early on so far mate
[2:18:50] DeanoTV: and ACCOUNT WIDE Kreygasm
[2:18:57] zgag: From the feedback
[2:19:01] charlie_the_snowman: Show the tabard on you
[2:19:09] BlackCl0ud: this looks so good
[2:19:24] ijuki: @zgag Recent changes? The speed decrease?
[2:19:27] charlie_the_snowman: oh okay
[2:19:29] unsolved_return: thought on ret pala @Towelliee
[2:19:31] kreff_: man the zone looks amazing, i missed the typical wow jungle areas
[2:19:39] Razmasbear: Do you theink we get Threads of Fate or similar system here?
[2:19:40] TheCliffyShow: Account-wide? Meaning within a a week people will have blown through everything, and be like, "there's no content".
[2:19:41] zgag: Dragon Riding *
[2:19:41] Larc9783: @TheCliffyShow That would be pretty funny. That little 4 legged centaur dragon looked like a midget version of the regular ones so I thought it was like a corgi breed
[2:19:53] Wolfenhoof: @zgag they fucked up the controls of the dragons
[2:20:06] unsolved_return: What do you think of ret palas this early on towelliee
[2:20:26] TheCliffyShow: @Larc9783 I think they are just young dragons. But, I like your explanation better.
[2:20:27] Wolfenhoof: everyone was prising the dagon riding, lets change this, people are happy
[2:20:28] Molvonos: @TheCliffyShow Come on now,  You know full well its going to take several months to unlock renown, because they can add stuff incrimentally like they did in SL.
[2:20:30] soge131: That's nice
[2:20:30] Sollice: Can you send soul cinders and soul ash to an alt?
[2:20:38] Molvonos: @Sollice Yes
[2:20:43] Gingerprimer: @Sollice yes
[2:20:49] Sollice: @Sollice Where do I go for that
[2:20:51] Gingerprimer: @Sollice and flux
[2:20:52] Molvonos: Check Korthia, Bonesmith
[2:20:55] manmower: will soulbound crafted items be BoA?
[2:20:58] Gingerprimer: @Sollice korthia
[2:21:04] Sollice: Bonesmith thats it ty
[2:21:08] Razmasbear: Yes you can and there is a pouch in Enlightedned at honored that contais enough ash + cinders to make R7 leggo
[2:21:26] KShellZx: it's Hogger

[2:35:41] gnarfarm: @looney199725 It's great push format
[2:35:49] ashnmsr: Right? but i want to chill and make gold somehow but you can't even with the new professions i suppose
[2:35:50] looney199725: ahhh i see
[2:36:06] cayna: Right now crafting is the highest Ilvl obtainable in the game KEKW
[2:36:11] Holysal: @Thoreya ofc he is. that is just gingi
[2:36:13] cayna: Probs will get fixed but
[2:36:24] MrFuzzynuts420: will the resources and regents drop in M+?
[2:36:25] MaxTheBandit: what DPS are you playing in the PRO-AM
[2:36:32] Nebulizer87: u will make gold but u have to put in some effort
[2:36:54] cayna: Yeah going off raid ilvl, But it will probs get fixed. Regardless jewelcrafting seems busted
[2:37:11] cayna: cause ring /neck Ilvls don't matter as much, But the stats are crazy
[2:37:11] ashnmsr: @Nebulizer87 this is what i like , i would put that effort , but the thing is in the end professionals become useless at least i think so
[2:37:21] cayna: But very excited for professions this expansion
[2:37:37] Razmasbear: Would reforning help with those issues?
[2:37:48] Poraxiss: These Quest protein chips are amazing in the morning, ngl
[2:37:54] Thunderbrew: Are they using the weekly vault for Raid, M+ and BG Gear in Dragonflight?
[2:37:58] Fragglevision: that # is confirmed?
[2:38:13] cayna: Just gotta remember, This type of crafting was there in BFA. and in BFA crafting was like mandatory for high end raiding. Evne if its a bit less Ilvl the stats were insane
[2:38:29] ashnmsr: @Towelliee what about this Make professions items only for 3 slot but they are stronger than any item in game?

[2:40:01] Mitune: tie it to professions and archeology and you have something
[2:40:02] Kisswani: more of this I say , this is probably gonna be a world quest tbh
[2:40:04] abracka_: archaeology would be nice with that rock climbing
[2:40:09] Valvax: let the vulpera die PepoDance

[2:41:38] Kisswani: Artifact ? AP ? POGGERS
[2:41:40] geokouts: we are in DRAGON isles we NEED Archeology
[2:41:44] davycarl136: archaeology had such missed potential. could have actually been a cooler feature than it was
[2:41:44] strike879: one thing that archeo needs is all elementals have a chance to drop fragments and a weekly boss similair to the garrison boss that drops allot
[2:41:52] berserker_strike: @boolmantv Good so far, about to hit the gym
[2:42:12] killercondon: Archeology would be dope in this give me a bone dragon
[2:42:14] MacroWaver: This season of MDI is sponsored by REI

[2:43:01] KydSage: this feels like some god of war LUL
[2:43:18] Wolfenhoof: The grace of a climbing tauren is at least uplifting to look at.
[2:43:23] sneaky_bankai: Why climb if the pickaxe is magical? Hmm
[2:43:24] KydSage: Sadge lost grip ?
[2:43:32] Valvax: thats a new parachute animation !

[2:44:15] TheItalianStallion321: you need to be taller lol
[2:44:26] zenohold: remove the auras
[2:44:30] zenohold: if you can
[2:44:41] rival_xo: whatis this, 20 years old graphics for a 2022 expansion
[2:44:44] rival_xo: blocky af
[2:44:44] manmower: you have to use grip a lot more often as Tauren because of the weight
[2:44:47] Gezber: that looks kinda cool
[2:45:22] Kisswani: KEKW
[2:45:28] rival_xo: should be unreal engine 5 so the game doesn't feel like a 2004 release
[2:45:35] Armdel: nvm that you fell down 3 times
[2:45:35] TheItalianStallion321: WoW's graphics are WoW's graphics. take it or leave it.
[2:45:38] Valvax: gnome being weird as usual
[2:45:45] thirtysilver: @Towelliee This isn't unreal 5 engine? Canceling preorder! Kappa
[2:45:46] itsDets: stop it
[2:45:47] ijuki: @rival_xo towCopium
[2:45:48] CrypticIceCream: @rival_xo good luck rewriting the entire game :D
[2:45:56] stabzmcgeee: if it was unreal engine 5 the game would feel outdated in 12 months
[2:45:59] Kuzzo99: If you think this looks anything like classic wow youre crazy lol
[2:46:00] zenohold: if the game was in unreal engine 5 most of the playerbase wont be able to run it.
[2:46:01] rival_xo: i mean wows graphics used to be its selling point now its just idk
[2:46:03] LUKA_THIM: lmao the people crying about graphics for wow is increasing and its annoying
[2:46:14] Holysal: @rival_xo they have improved the graphics. its not like 2004 LUL
[2:46:15] Molvonos: towNod
[2:46:17] TheItalianStallion321: @rival_xo what? lol no it wasnt
[2:46:19] SaintTheFirst: nope, never
[2:46:22] h_u_r_k_: oh he opened a can on this
[2:46:23] Kisswani: danHuh ?
[2:46:24] SensationalBanana: KEK
[2:46:24] Thunderbrew: It wouldn't be WoW if it had all new graphics
[2:46:25] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: say what!
[2:46:25] Armdel: when? in 2005?
[2:46:26] DarkIntentz: I never ONCE wanted to play wow cuz of the graphics....
[2:46:28] SensationalBanana: Not at all true
[2:46:28] Valvax: back in 2004 yea i guess?
[2:46:29] stabzmcgeee: the trolls are strong this morning
[2:46:29] Wolfenhoof: When was wows grafics its selling point. The game looked like shit compared even to Lotro and Everquest 2.
[2:46:30] dalaraz: i dont want different graphics tbh :p
[2:46:31] TheItalianStallion321: imagine saying i play wow for the graphics KEKW
[2:46:31] MacroWaver: I want photo-realistic tauren already
[2:46:38] thirtysilver: Wow graphics have a nice stylization to them. Love em.
[2:46:40] Dystilled: Man, ive heard some dumb takes. But thats up there
[2:46:46] Molvonos: The Selling Point For WoW's Graphics was always that it could run on LOW END computers.  The fuck?
[2:46:48] solsaver12: true
[2:46:54] ytsidilas: and here I thought wow was always meant to be played on below average rigs
[2:46:59] thirtysilver: @Towelliee Even wildstar???  ;)
[2:47:06] SensationalBanana: WoW ages like fine scotch in its looks, unlike more realistic looking games.
[2:47:07] ashwing_: Wow 2 will SURELY be on Unreal 5 KEKW
[2:47:08] zenohold: You know whats it's insane is that the game gets bigger constantly imagine in 2030 we will have probably over 250GB game haha
[2:47:14] dalaraz: @Tubbylumpkin you dont even need to play for that !
[2:47:18] LUKA_THIM: i can still play wow on my 10 year old computer on 5 settings i think thats a selling point
[2:47:20] Wolfenhoof: wows grafic got better with the years, the other games didn't, but 2004/5 wow looked janky as fuck compared to other mmos.
[2:47:36] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: i will say there are some expansions that look better then current ones seems more refined then when it was current
[2:47:39] dalaraz: wildstar didnt age well generally,not just graphics :p
[2:47:43] Falxftw: hard for wildstar to age when its age stopped going up years ago when it DIED~
[2:47:49] Molvonos: Got some kids in here, def.  I remember the devs talking about that back in the original closed beta -- they wanted to keep the game playable on lower end computers so everyone could enjoy it.
[2:47:52] Razmasbear: Wow has it own distinct style and I think its just good
[2:47:55] Brannax: lmao gw2
[2:47:55] thirtysilver: @ashwing_  No, unity thirty73
[2:48:05] zenohold: In the future 500GB game haha
[2:48:07] h_u_r_k_: now the teams even bigger excited for 10.0
[2:48:09] Manabucho: @ashwing_ dont you mean UNREAL 8? cause that wont happen untill decades have past KEKW
[2:48:13] TheItalianStallion321: i mean the graphics arent bad but people play the game for the story, the PvE/PvP content. its why its been almost 20 years going

[2:49:43] SteLawBro: fk it. Just let everyone do dam
[2:49:44] Molvonos: @velkoff Something in your rig is if you're running into fps issues.
[2:49:59] dalaraz: graphics is the last issue wow has to fix :p
[2:50:00] Cloudslinger: lol
[2:50:03] ijuki: WoW is mostly CPU bound
[2:50:12] ijuki: Slowly going over to GPU
[2:50:13] darkiozzzz: I just saw you fly to this quest but i dont know much about dragon flying but can you just numpad and afk or is it a hands on type of flying?
[2:50:17] berserker_strike: Noone cares about wows graphic
[2:50:18] Thunderbrew: @dalaraz Most accurate comment yet this morning
[2:50:21] velkoff: @Molvonos it rly isnt dude .. are u playing a diff game :D
[2:50:25] Holysal: @velkoff you need cpu for wow not gpu lol
[2:50:27] Razmasbear: 5500 here and i still get the dips
[2:50:30] manmower: did they change the cast bars on the mobs?
[2:50:34] Razmasbear: 5800*
[2:50:37] Molvonos: @velkoff lol, read above to better understand your issue.
[2:50:47] LeXieSterling: WOW takes care of the backend
[2:50:52] metavahn231: gw2 is the only better looking mmo
[2:50:52] velkoff: @Holysal thats why i said they need better multythread utilisation..
[2:50:55] Falxftw: wow uses its art style to overcome high fidelity/realism type graphics.. works good for them
[2:51:01] ijuki: I got a 5900x, 3090 and I get fps drops at world bosses PepeWhy
[2:51:02] meroxzx: wows in game art style reminds me of a like a disney graphics
[2:51:07] manmower: people play new 16bit games
[2:51:11] MacroWaver: People play gw2?
[2:51:15] velkoff: @Molvonos read my comment to understand i mentioned it lol
[2:51:17] backstreetalright: WoW is not only a game is a legacy and that translates into the tec obviously
[2:51:24] Todmeister9000: gw2 is a very good game
[2:51:24] abracka_: honestly looking forward to seeing what the XIV team can do with a graphical update
[2:51:25] Manabucho: i mean making your own game engine is expensive af
[2:51:29] SensationalBanana: WoW always had cartoony art style. Graphics are a different topic. These people.
[2:51:41] h_u_r_k_: @meroxzx disney graphics.. i want what u smoked lol
[2:51:47] kashmara: correct
[2:51:50] Nebulizer87: gw2 can have more than 50 ppl on teh screen and not lag the zone
[2:51:55] Ajxx: @towelliee Have you seen the bio environment for Aoc? Looking extremly good
[2:51:58] berserker_strike: u know how they can afford that? they rob us players
[2:52:00] sirledros: I think some of the world graphics in WoW look amazing but some of the animations and armor look straight out of 2009
[2:52:01] zenohold: If wow was free2play the quality would drastically be reduced 100%
[2:52:01] Nebulizer87: def the most frustrating thing with WoW now
[2:52:04] Mecabeast: wows artstyle is basically future proof
[2:52:25] Kavieonn: What about Star Citizen?
[2:52:32] kashmara: I always found wow's art style cool and pretty in its own way
[2:52:38] MacroWaver: if your game is lagging in a 50 person zone I think thats an issue with your internet
[2:52:52] Razmasbear: Need to go and take care of the horses, take care, all of you
[2:52:57] Kisswani: WoW 2K , now with sweatier models Kappa
[2:52:57] Kuzzo99: Games that go for a realistic look usually end up looking so outdated only a few years after its release.
[2:52:58] meroxzx: @h_u_r_k_ dont smoke but i assume my neighbour smokes some weard shit so its affecting me
[2:53:01] MakaiiART: @Mecabeast you can say this about any heavily stylized game tbh. creating a long running game, but wanting it more realistic, is shooting yourself in the foot
[2:53:05] Broomba: You lag in a zone with 50 people your pc sucks
[2:53:10] abracka_: i'm not entirely too hopeful on AoC running. unreal engine 5 in a MMO setting with current gen systems? scared to see what it does performance wise
[2:53:11] Manabucho: @Towelliee imagine wow gameplay look like the scenematics POGGERS
[2:53:11] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee how are you liking Ret?
[2:53:15] Nebulizer87: @MacroWaver Nazjatar pvp event never playable game issue bud

[2:53:36] sirledros: @abracka_ well it wont come out for 6 more years so not to much to worry about
[2:53:39] abracka_: @xendros78 towHeh towHeh
[2:53:45] TheItalianStallion321: @davycarl136 i agree
[2:53:47] Ohdies: Yeah but ashes isn’t using a proprietary engine. The upkeep of the engine and graphic fidelity is on unreal
[2:53:48] ijuki: I get lag at world bosses, although, I am running everything maxed out and 4k... Guess I get what I deserver then PepeWhy
[2:53:57] Ohdies: Ashes only need to profit share lol
[2:53:59] MacroWaver: I was on both sides of nazjatar raids and I never had trouble
[2:54:04] zenohold: I used to love this game called Serious sam but ever since serious sam 4 they made it so relaistic it put me off instantly.

[9:32:21] chickdrummer88: ^
[9:32:38] TheFox0228: I mean getting tilted over a competition is understandable. Some people are just that competitive that even if it's for a good cause, they still want to dominate the comp.
[9:32:52] chickdrummer88: it's a pro am
[9:33:03] TheFox0228: not saying people should, just saying i understand why someone that competitive might tilt
[9:33:17] joe_theviking: @elitistdk don't talk bad about other streamers in here
