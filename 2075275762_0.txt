[0:58:38] StromicusRex: i've seen people say its actually not too bad, especially if you can watch it without comparing it to the animation
[0:58:49] zerx_gg: even if you compare it, it's not too bad

[0:59:42] VetisBR: W
[0:59:43] Aeldeth: I think any live action adaptation is going to have its issues so a bit unfair to do a direct 1:1 comparison with source

[1:20:43] Matzefyr: I don't recommend swap for any serious pvp player. Not a lot of people realize this, but it doesn't provide any healing. It just swaps the hp around
[1:20:44] Badasti: you can cook it in the oven, but you make it in turkeys Kappa
[1:20:45] wackpoetic: The proper way to prepare turkey bacon is by throwing it the garbajjjj
[1:20:48] zerx_gg: ok afk again see soon
[1:20:49] Jarettol: you can...it just won't crisp up as nicely
[1:20:50] cashewdad: turkey bacon is already basically cooked

[1:21:14] shivwren: Yes, you can do all bacon in the oven
[1:21:14] cashewdad: broil them top oven rack for like 2-3 mins per side
[1:21:24] cashewdad: if you want crispies
[1:21:37] Izzythediscpriest: i forgot about the turkey bacon i had in the oven the one day. lets just say it was super crispy
[1:21:45] Jarettol: oooo...I didn't think about broil...that'd do it
[1:21:47] NightMunchies: if u want bacon eat the god stuff not turkey
[1:22:14] StromicusRex: this guy named himself nightmunchies but is the pickiest eater i've ever seen in my life

[1:36:06] Acurarx: ketchup makes me want to vomit. the smell, sight, I can’t.
[1:36:06] hoombledad: you have to look for "non enriched" grains basically
[1:36:09] NightMunchies: wonder bread is garbage
[1:36:19] Luigicamp: @cashewdad it's 21 weeks, not 2 years.
[1:36:19] numero5218: it’s way harder and less available than foods that are good for you
[1:36:21] wackpoetic: no it's true, if you're a foreigner landing in the USA for the first time you have to eat a Big Mac to get through customs

[1:37:45] Izzythediscpriest: i go to a local bakery all the time. the bread doesnt last long cause there isnt any preservatives and is cheaper then the crap in the grocery store
[1:37:50] Luigicamp: I think the problem is not the food itself, it's the availability. Too much and too many.
[1:37:50] zachgamegodx: as someone who spent alot of my childhood in EU, people have this weird fascination with NA being unhealthy, man i had a fast food spot at every street corner where i grew up.

[2:12:30] ferahgok: Great, another expansion where we spend the entire time waiting for balance tunings....only to have decent balance achieved right in time for the next expansions release.
[2:12:59] Skillcap: damn boi
[2:13:21] galdinator: I love when they just say something has "a chance" of happening instead of giving a % LUL
[2:13:28] SloppyWalrus_: imagine having to balance this across all specs in pve/pvp modes

[2:14:27] ferahgok: That's what you call "job security" release something completely broken so that you can spend the entire expansion balancing
[2:14:32] modsbruto: lost the hope of this game being "fair" at all

[2:18:14] numba9os: i just wanna see ww trees cmon blizz
[2:18:17] galdinator: I feel like the only way they can update the game is by making spells more complicated via modifiers
[2:18:22] galdinator: what else are they supposed to even do LUL
[2:18:24] krisdahaka: war within already bloated
[2:18:27] ungodlyxdx: seems kinda boring tbh
[2:18:28] krisdahaka: LUL
[2:18:30] cypher020: game already complicated
[2:18:32] snakefizz: they are just going to tune around those modifiers anyway

[2:33:39] zerx_gg: can you say the last talent again
[2:33:48] zerx_gg: from rogue
[2:33:53] oz__tv: you all talk about rog but still cant play it properly
[2:33:54] legiontheworgen: @ferahgok 30% with one of the talents in that tree
[2:34:01] tformerz: what is the fastest way to get quenquest?
[2:34:11] FlyingPuncake: KEKW
[2:34:18] satirically1: isnt that just demo tier atm?
[2:34:20] snakefizz: NAMEPLATES
[2:34:22] snakefizz: MORE NAMEPLATES
[2:34:26] iLLwiLL_HS: NPCS
[2:34:39] dr_grx: haha
[2:34:39] DrWarz: @venruki  why is warrior so bad at pvp?
[2:35:06] ajdowers: Have we done hunters yet ?
[2:35:12] zerx_gg: 150% of 0 is still 0
[2:35:29] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[2:35:32] oz__tv: one of the rogue hero talent tree counters some parrys of 2 speccs and everyone is crying lol
[2:35:34] tangell0s: Scalecommander looking neat
[2:35:35] Axtin: you always get it now
[2:35:38] Axtin: without soulburning
[2:35:39] danielrx25: it is
[2:35:49] hamsti: oh nice
[2:35:50] hamsti: lmfao
[2:36:07] doctorduckz: are these patch changes?
[2:36:12] doctorduckz: when is this getting released
[2:36:18] gelatokush: next expact
[2:36:20] DoYouWannaHug: LMAO
[2:36:24] hamsti: next xpac --- its not even in beta yet so probably will change @doctorduckz
[2:36:40] hamsti: relax @modsbruto
[2:36:45] doctorduckz: thanks
[2:37:08] shawdowfax77: @modsbruto probably right
[2:37:12] DoYouWannaHug: prob targets pets
[2:37:20] Incin_gaming: can someone link this plz
[2:37:55] Ribastur0075: templar ok as well
[2:38:01] tangell0s: I'm excited for Scalecommander
[2:38:08] Keylightz: doubt it will work that way in pvp tho for tricks ?

[2:38:20] oz__tv: why does trickster is the best when its countering only 2 specs with warri and monk who else use parry lol
[2:38:32] DegStaerian: FoF
[2:38:38] Hammer90x: sounds like fyralath
[2:38:54] hamsti: KEKW
[2:39:09] oz__tv: but its the main thing
[2:39:17] modsbruto: @Hammer90x with no-charge, right ?
[2:39:35] Schwenkyytv: i would think the gain of combo points is the best part of it
[2:39:37] isseswagger: trickster: "how can we make every ww monk into a rogue"
[2:40:04] gothadult: morning @venruki
[2:40:12] oz__tv: thats what I say 2 combo points with faknt is like nothing
[2:40:19] Keylightz: 1 hour duration of tricks of the trade if works in pvp would be nuts + 15% dmg to your partner perma
[2:40:22] maxdoesmath: can you change hero talents before games just like regular talents?
[2:40:22] oz__tv: faint
[2:40:59] cantfindthebox: asmr Venruki just going over stats of classes
[2:41:03] hamsti: the size part
[2:41:04] DegStaerian: versatility
[2:41:05] hamsti: is kinda cool
[2:41:06] hamsti: KEKW
[2:41:08] snakefizz: LOL
[2:41:13] theodeth: big boi
[2:41:31] ferahgok: @oz__tv It's not the main thing. It has a large built in counter to 2 specs but it goes way beyond that for every other spec - it's about the blades and "fazed" debuff
[2:41:36] DegStaerian: more immunity for arms lol
[2:41:41] theodeth: what does demolish do
[2:41:41] Axtin: just what arms warriors needed
[2:41:50] modsbruto: ty blizz, im calmer now
[2:42:07] egrounds: is it just me, or does it seem like DEVS just throw shit at a wall and see if it sticks. If OP they update later in a patch ... do they PTR test this stuff?
[2:42:15] modsbruto: add Mortal Strike resets cooldown of Charge
[2:42:18] modsbruto: and ill be happy
[2:42:19] nightst314: wehre is my 30% leech passive? I still need a healer
[2:42:25] Hammer90x: did it mention that Demolish is castable while moving?
[2:42:30] eainzsp: 45 second cd right? directly counters sweep?
[2:42:30] galdinator: Ignore pain buffed... Mud is ecstatic..
[2:42:35] Axtin: the shockwave is the most insane honestly
[2:42:40] Axtin: if they dont nerf it in pvp
[2:42:50] dr_grx: rogues will still own
[2:42:52] Hammer90x: @eainzsp sounds like just dont sweep into a channeling warrior?
[2:42:56] theodeth: paladins causing melanoma
[2:43:05] ferahgok: shockwave into fully stacked demolish = gg
[2:43:07] modsbruto: whats the most meh, most op and most xitty in ur opinion...mr.ruki !?
[2:43:12] Magottx: Did you look at the lock one yet
[2:43:14] DoYouWannaHug: Demo seems unkillable
[2:43:17] oz__tv: @ferahgok „debuff“ like this are in the game already for many specs its not op at all. and 2 combo points with faint is also nothing to talk about because with outlaw or sub you dont even need to think about enough combo points
[2:43:20] jporter_: diabolist seems cool
[2:43:21] illEvan11_11: warlock seemed good also
[2:43:23] modsbruto: cool cool
[2:43:25] Sirkahn: Back then they removed shamans aoe stun to 3seconds....
[2:43:28] baxter5569: Scale commander looks fun :) going to be great for pvp and mega bursty for Dev in pvp
[2:43:28] hamsti: idk its kinda fun when the games insanely broken KEKW
[2:43:35] Sirkahn: It used to be 5
[2:43:38] What_ln_Tarnation: i played spellslinger in wildstar
[2:43:45] cantfindthebox: wanna do some 2’s venruki
[2:43:47] ferahgok: a warrior convoke immune to cc lol. nice
[2:43:50] pibbon: pibbon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:43:54] Sirkahn: Now they give a 5sec aoe stun to warriors? 🤔
[2:43:56] ajdowers: Is Hunter ones out yet ?
[2:44:01] Acurarx: shadow priest will be trash and incongruent
[2:44:17] Axtin: its like theyre adding covenants and soulbinds again except theyre talents instead so u can swap whenever, but it wont be balanced
[2:44:23] oz__tv: warrior convole immun to cc and 5 sec aoe stun is waaay more op then fazed debuff from rogue
[2:44:32] oz__tv: you guya really need to chill on rogues
[2:44:49] What_ln_Tarnation: theyre already insane
[2:44:53] Locturnal_TV: theyre finally looking strong. let them have their time in the sun
[2:44:58] SweatyDaniels: hot take: there should be a 3rd DH spec called Chaos and its just a fistweaver that can fly
[2:44:59] cantfindthebox: where did pikaboo hurt you
[2:45:06] eainzsp: blizz posted 23 minutes ago theyre changing war tree to make shockwave more accessible
[2:45:12] zerx_gg: wow ven ur dh looks so cool!!!
[2:45:16] zerx_gg: too bad they're unplayable
[2:45:22] ellisrainy: you guys need to chill on rogue ill have u know im only 1400 after 2000 games rogues are not broken
[2:45:29] Telarius1: he finally has a good mog on dh after 3000 years
[2:45:29] willie_stroker_99: Are they changing the talent tree again, or this is addition to the current?
[2:45:42] oz__tv: only op thing from trickster is the parry part thing for wws and warris
[2:45:44] Thoreya: @willie_stroker_99 in addition.
[2:45:53] blueblrrrd: got any o dem dragonflights for sale?
[2:45:57] oz__tv: what else ? 2 combo points on faint?
[2:46:00] Sirkahn: Show your talents again Ven, plz
[2:46:02] orcrimmar: it seems like that new warrior ability will just be fyr'alath weapon ability which doesn't seem to good since it grounds in you in place
[2:46:03] Xenolai: can someone link me what he was just looking at pleasE?
[2:46:29] khrylx_: as if rogues arent baseline s tier every expansion lol
[2:46:30] fisherman948: damn they just added tabard of frost
[2:46:30] Hammer90x: he's probably trolling
[2:46:32] Xenolai: ty
[2:46:32] blueblrrrd: supa lookin at trickster rogue rn
[2:46:41] Skillcap: they picked the name right tho
[2:46:43] Telarius1: feint legit works against lik 90% of abiltiies in the game cuz everything is aoe now
[2:46:44] Schwenkyytv: its the consistent combo points that they are getting
[2:46:44] oz__tv: tell what then ? compared to a warri convoke and a 5 sec aoe stun
[2:47:09] poolparty98: i love the war within talents, why ppl hating
[2:47:15] emergencxyz: @Telarius1 Q?
[2:47:19] oz__tv: ok as a rog main I can tell you combo points are not a big deal as outlaw pr sub
[2:47:35] Telarius1: lmao @emergencxyz  whats up dude
[2:47:46] kingcamps_alot: You gotta pick a path though right? You dont get all them
[2:47:47] Locturnal_TV: think feint has 2 charges also :)
[2:47:52] Necrolancer47: i cannot heal solo shuffle anymore i have thrown in my towel
[2:47:54] Axtin: a lot of things trigger fazed too
[2:47:59] Magottx: Could you link that plz ven
[2:48:01] specialk627: I don’t think the parry thing changes much - you already can’t parry cheap shot and SS. they’re already cracked against warriors and monks
[2:48:06] Telarius1: Between the eyes is 100% crit chance, when dancing, or vanish for 6 sec after as well.
[2:48:07] emergencxyz: @Telarius1 Terrorize the ladder time double dh?
[2:48:13] khrylx_: but why put all that bs into feint lol
[2:48:17] emergencxyz: glad wins are needed
[2:48:41] ferahgok: it triggers "Fazed"
[2:48:41] sudd7: 25% crit dmg increase on combo point generators
[2:48:50] Hammer90x: dont forget the 10 yards on sap :D
[2:49:00] oz__tv: alrighg now compare it to warri and lock lol
[2:49:26] Telarius1: i predict it now that blizz will do what they did in wod, and nerf-every class, then give u the "Power ups" as u get higher.
[2:49:29] squarepusher_: I'm so fazed rn VapeNation
[2:49:37] zerx_gg: suhh
[2:49:40] Telarius1: I think we're applying all of this to classes now, when they prob gunna pseudo scale everything down b4 u get all this
[2:49:44] Telarius1: @emergencxyz check dms
[2:49:45] kingcamps_alot: Do you get all those talents though?  Or do you have to pick one of 3 paths?
[2:49:54] oz__tv: dont forget faint fazed debuff are 5 sec only
[2:50:05] Keylightz: wow really i thought i had to choose
[2:50:09] Keylightz: omg now i get it
[2:50:15] kingcamps_alot: What ? Thats crazy i though it was pick a path thing
[2:50:15] emergencxyz: @Telarius1 dms where?
[2:50:19] oz__tv: and now compare it to warrior 5 sec aoe stun or lock
[2:50:19] emergencxyz: on bnet?
[2:50:19] ferahgok: Use your Feignt defensive and be rewarded with more damage basically
[2:50:21] Magottx: Ven can you link that hero talent page plz I can’t find it on phone
[2:50:26] khrylx_: @oz__tv it has 15 s cd and 2 charges xd

[2:50:36] eainzsp: disentegrate is going to pump
[2:50:44] illEvan11_11: basically, just press eint on cd
[2:50:47] illEvan11_11: feint
[2:50:51] Hammer90x: lol oz is just trolling
[2:50:51] khrylx_: i mean rogues will be broken no matter what as long as they have spammable stuns every dr
[2:51:04] zerx_gg: these hero talents are cool and all but it doesnt take away that dh is literally unplayable righ tnow
[2:51:12] oz__tv: its like 10% this 5% that
[2:51:15] oz__tv: notjing else
[2:51:23] zerx_gg: 10% is a lot
[2:51:32] ImJordanHi: Maybe it's time we just all play rogues, so that they buff the shit out of other classes for participation

[2:51:52] fungames: Diabolist Warlock is such a sick name :)

[2:51:58] khrylx_: inb4 ww will be like: faeline stomp initial dmg increased by 5%
[2:52:00] Fragssgaming: does this mean rogues might finally be good?
[2:52:02] wyldeshock: top ranked mogs and playlist in this stream
[2:52:12] ImJordanHi: Palumor thinks Sterge is the best healer in WoW
[2:52:15] fungames: I would play that just to be called a diabolist warlock lol
[2:52:28] What_ln_Tarnation: im guessing most of these talents will be revised and changed, expansion not even in alpha yet
[2:52:37] oz__tv: just saying its strong but its not crazy op like you guys think thats it

[2:53:24] eainzsp: its a rogues world, we are just living in it
[2:53:26] illEvan11_11: def seem really op against those classes, ranged classes it seems a little underwhelming. overall rogues will always be good tho
[2:53:35] Skillcap: are the changes after awc just rumors or are confirmed?
[2:53:38] What_ln_Tarnation: look at all these cockroach rogues
[2:54:04] oz__tv: @illevan11_11 true fazed is trash against range dds

[2:59:57] kimchiii1132: what’s your opener for SS’s? any tips for a new DH trying to climb? Any tips for RBG’s or Solos? anything would help!

[3:05:05] drfeltgood: Morning @venruki
[3:05:07] kimchiii1132: what’s better for DH? the immo build or blade dance?
[3:05:14] emergencxyz: @kimchiii1132 Depends on matchup
[3:05:33] Skillcap: stupid question, but that warr root is it a talent or?
[3:05:36] legionestland: gg
[3:05:42] kimchiii1132: it’s a pvp talent for warriors
[3:05:45] menshika: healer lobby eh
[3:06:00] SteLawBro: Like trying to run from a horror villian.
[3:06:09] kimchiii1132: would you say facing a melee comp you’d go immo build for the constant dots?
[3:06:17] Schwenkyytv: poor priest can only walk while everyone is zooming and porting
[3:06:34] kimchiii1132: I believe I saw some DH have 2-3 immo auras  up at once is that really true? they stack?
[3:06:49] emergencxyz: @kimchiii1132 No I would play the eyebeam uptime build
[3:06:53] drfeltgood: @kimchiii1132 yep, I have had 6 up at one time
[3:07:22] emergencxyz: Play double immo aura if you are vs Destro ELE boomy or stuff where you will be rooted all the time
[3:07:57] kimchiii1132: I just started a DH and my buddies told me to stick with the blade dance build. is having the immo build the best for the “freedoms” and “cleanses” the talent gives us?
[3:08:07] driftwood_tc: You're a DH main now Ven, stay in your lane

[5:00:02] Flopsyde: combat is just atrociously bad
[5:00:04] Badasti: ret paladin s1
[5:00:08] NightMunchies: good times back then
[5:00:18] Baconeggcheese: @Sheepyou looks like classic
[5:00:18] NightMunchies: combat rogue
[5:00:19] Salanzo: idk to be fair facing fistweavers with a melee cleave in 3s all day sounds equally unfun :(
[5:00:25] Jarettol: no thanks to that, lol
[5:00:25] NightMunchies: now its outlaw
[5:00:27] dismantlle: for me sod hype died when they took sooo long to release p2
[5:00:30] pharmztko: KEKW
[5:00:39] Badasti: i hate it when people type gd when it was a garbage duel
[5:00:41] Baconeggcheese: This is peak pvp
[5:00:44] zen_oni_shinobi: sod 1v1 looks like cs quick scope speed draw
[5:00:46] NightMunchies: i loved combat rogue
[5:00:56] pharmztko: 1 shot “gd”
[5:01:00] vodkacran: @Badasti gd = garbage duel duh

[5:01:05] Flopsyde: "gd" KEKW
[5:01:06] NovaSun84: ah so Blizz isn't balancing around PvP
[5:01:13] squarepusher_: people are allowed to enjoy sod, but it mainly feels like content farming to me.
[5:01:18] pbj_time: mage is kinda fried
[5:01:21] floor_rooster: funny part is they nerfed hunters in sod for doing to much damage but thats not a problem lmao
[5:01:33] Badasti: you playing double illidan?
[5:01:37] NightMunchies: everyone is struggling to get to Max lv thats all

[5:02:16] floor_rooster: @heymomimonttv no there exposive shot got nerfed and carve got put on gcd
[5:02:24] Baconeggcheese: Bring out the fistruki
[5:02:28] jporter_: the warlock one sounds awesome for demo
[5:02:31] NightMunchies: triple evokers be insane
[5:02:39] zachgamegodx: refute his request
[5:02:41] pbj_time: but then i have so much enjoyable time in SoD, then i load up retail arena rated 3s at 2.2 mmr and play agaisnt demon hunter/x/rdruid comps 90% of games. Somehow it just makes the game completely unenjoyable
[5:02:50] Vigi9413: mm/dh that's interesting
[5:02:56] Badasti: its bursty...
[5:03:07] Captura68: is Dh good ?

[6:08:12] drmongoloid: dragonflight season 3 of dh
[6:08:37] Secretwombatbro: you just spread it when you make contact with people
[6:08:41] Secretwombatbro: its supposed to do that
[6:08:45] Secretwombatbro: its in the text
[6:08:50] Multiplemitch: or hunt through someone
[6:08:54] 1Refi: Surely it's time to touch retail now. I know some people like the trinket and stamina change but this is just a joke at this stage
[6:08:55] ATHLTE: lul dh
[6:08:58] Telarius1: yes, for 0.5 sec after ur hunt, u have an invisible aura that will apply the dot to anyone in ur melee range. it auto applies if theyre grouped.
[6:09:04] Telarius1: But if they're far-away you can rush to them
[6:09:21] nameyourform: read hunt
[6:09:24] Telarius1: Like if ur super quick, and have enough haste
[6:09:32] tomjb91: You dont need to fell rush you can just strafe and it spreads
[6:09:42] Telarius1: Press hunter, veng retreat instnatly, it will have no animation
[6:09:44] Secretwombatbro: right but think about the wow code. its probably an aura on you and that doesnt expire till a server tick
[6:09:45] Telarius1: Hunt*
[6:10:06] gelatokush: pretty situational use it sometimes
[6:10:33] Telarius1: Press Hunt, then Veng retreat, (It will have no animation.) This way, you can apply dot to someone far away, and still apply to the melee near u
[6:11:34] pharmztko: lol
[6:11:54] nameyourform: im pulling for the other teams tbh
[6:11:55] 1Refi: Rofl
[6:12:00] nameyourform: lol
[6:12:06] Telarius1: u have to be quick on it, that was way too slow
[6:12:15] Telarius1: Its hunt, as soon as cast finish, veng.
[6:12:21] Thrells: anyone have tmobile? I see they offer netflix for free
[6:12:36] gelatokush: most time i use hunt to gap close but yea
[6:12:37] Telarius1: be good distance away as well
[6:12:43] SteLawBro: Maybe next patch DH will finally be playable and mages will stop dominating everything.
[6:13:15] Magottx: Why did I just come home to this comp… Ven youre on the tv for my dog and THIS is what you’re corrupting him with!? FeelsBadMan
[6:13:35] Telarius1: too slow again tbh. Should be way faster
[6:13:49] Telarius1: like, ur animation shouldnt go anywhere near.
[6:13:52] jdubz2021: is dh that broken ?
[6:13:57] pharmztko: you can hunt without the travel time
[6:14:01] Telarius1: You Hunt, retreat insta, it will no animation. And u can spread from far
[6:14:03] jdubz2021: every ones on it
[6:14:04] Telarius1: Yes
[6:14:07] gelatokush: yea
[6:14:08] Telarius1: Like INSTA
[6:14:11] Telarius1: No delay, no travel time.
[6:14:14] swishoriginal: just got in chat. Ven what you think about the paladin talents
[6:14:16] Telarius1: No charge
[6:14:40] gelatokush: its possible ever since they cut gcd of vengful retreat t0 .5 sec gcd
[6:14:42] SteLawBro: The spreadings intended. The animation cancelling...Probably not so muuch lol.
[6:14:47] R1_Prototype: fel rush telelports you up to 40 yards away to your target and applies darkness at 60% effectiveness. #buffDH
[6:14:58] Magottx: I genuinely can’t get myself to Que lately knowing this spec is in the game.
[6:15:02] Magottx: Just unfair
[6:16:38] Magottx: Point proven
[6:17:02] repsac1442: new demon hunter talents every time you meta summon three versions of yourself dealing 50% of your damage and copying all spells
[6:17:41] kropieto: Yo Ven, against resto shaman if my duo can't target healing totems should I be killing them as healer?

[6:21:02] zachgamegodx: playing with a pet into dh
[6:21:10] zachgamegodx: they’re gonna kill that thing
[6:21:16] zachgamegodx: and absorb its soul
[6:21:32] Magottx: Nope, not really. Just grinding but i like it

[6:31:07] galdinator: therse like 20 spots for dh and 3 spots for some specs
