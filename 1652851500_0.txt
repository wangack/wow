[1:11:29] kijhbkjgvkjfcv: @g00tchitson Yeah my friend says stocks especially recently aren't the safest. But he puts into a wide pool of dividends and just reinvests. So if 1 crashes, he won't lose much.

[5:04:10] Vinlandkk: mounts and some pets
[5:04:21] unknownbudz: DHs need some kind of nerf
[5:04:52] fitts_sempai: you are using the mic for the headset? :O
[5:04:52] henriksson__: Hey Swift, what do you think on Arms Warrior? is that far behind on pvp compared to Fury?
[5:05:19] fitts_sempai: amazing headset
[5:05:35] MrTumnustv: bring back swifty one shot macro BABBYY
[5:05:38] Packerfan1993: a 50 percent nerf
[5:05:57] Grouwdi: DH doesn't need a single nerf - people forget we all have Legendary items - that's why things are out of control
[5:06:08] unknownbudz: They ar untouched in the patch tmrw but they felt the need to make holy paladins use more mana as well.. when we are already having huge mana issues.. like id ont get what blizz is thinking
[5:06:21] unknownbudz: whats dhs legendary
[5:06:33] unknownbudz: surelyt the legendary alone doesnt make him do that much dmg..
[5:06:33] zomclown: you not playing classic any more?

[5:07:08] unknownbudz: locks get huge nerf tmrw
[5:07:11] unknownbudz: dh dont
[5:07:22] Grouwdi: depends on which Legendary' they have - but that's why they're strong atm - after Dragonflight everyone loses their Lego's
[5:07:29] unknownbudz: nah they get dmg reduced in pvp
[5:07:32] unknownbudz: did u not se that?
[5:07:45] Xaviwan078: but my ret and frost dk can kill dh and wallakk i have good enough gear  but they are op
[5:07:59] Grouwdi: new Talent tree system isn't designed to have Legendary items
[5:08:07] unknownbudz: well AFF locks got a nerf
[5:08:13] unknownbudz: thats it
[5:08:34] Grouwdi: Locks are always too strong, cloth class with near-tanking abilities is insane
[5:08:35] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://go.corsair.com/LP9zBa
[5:09:06] unknownbudz: ya only aff getting alot dmg nerfs
[5:09:28] unknownbudz: Agony no longer deals 15% increased damage in PvP combat. Corruption no longer deals 15% increased damage in PvP combat. Siphon Life no longer deals 15% increased damage in PvP combat. Shadow Bolt no longer deals 10% increased damage in PvP combat.
[5:09:50] unknownbudz: pretty big nerfs for that spec
[5:09:56] Grouwdi: I'm quite scared - these new Talent systems are unfamiliar to today's Blizzard team and they couldn't balance classes when we have the Cata talent system.
[5:10:09] unknownbudz: ya just aff
[5:10:23] unknownbudz: yup agreed
[5:10:28] unknownbudz: thats what im worried about

[6:46:57] FitzFlips: There is only one thing that concerns me. If i try to buy a Eternal equipment chest on an alt that have enough conquest to buy one, but isn´t 1,4k rated, it won´t let me buy one. So, can you even use the chest on a fresh lvl60 Evoker? Or do you need 1,4k rating at least to open the chest?
