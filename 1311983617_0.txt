[1:13:44] ninedraft317: How‚Äôs the 9-5 challenge going I haven‚Äôt been able to watch the last week
[1:13:56] MaleFrom73: If you vendor the grey hat before 9.2.5, will you still get the transmog?
[1:15:25] Kneckt: Aion wings were cool
[1:15:30] Kneckt: was meh game tho
[1:15:34] Ludicruz: @MaleFrom73  always a possibility,  but to be safe.  Keep it in your inventory/bank inventory.
[1:16:06] Alienfromger: omg aion with 5fps pvp
[1:16:07] Knocx: hes playing it now
[1:16:23] MaleFrom73: @Ludicruz I have auto vendor on, so might be something to remember to turn off
[1:16:42] theDirtyon3: yeah its rough sometimes
[1:16:44] Ludicruz: see if there is a whitelist feature within the addon.
[1:16:46] biggie013: Why is it taking so long time?
[1:16:56] Ludicruz: if it is there, make sure to tag the hat there.
[1:17:02] theDirtyon3: its not always like that its just good weeks and bad weeks
[1:17:24] biggie013: I was thiking start playing agin today
[1:17:32] Clicklesly: It's also why the general advice is to push your own keys though ^^
[1:17:39] biggie013: and this the first thing i hear when coming in to your stream
[1:17:45] biggie013: now i dont know i wanna play
[1:18:59] rymerre: thats one of the reasons why i only pvp
[1:19:02] veryhairyheyyall: oof
[1:19:13] papascruge: Not having a group of friends does make it pretty rough
[1:19:25] Kneckt: Love that u can experience that , cus thats legit how it is
[1:19:34] Vahs_Redclaw: i cant play this game for 2 reasons, the first is daily requirement, the second is what u talking about
[1:19:35] rLeo2: I play with the biggest debuff, I play in Ragnaros
[1:19:37] biggie013: Sounds like you woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

[1:20:40] maccaruso: Yup, welcome to WoW
[1:21:15] Arawn67: mythic+ is part of the reason I don't play much. Plus enjoying classes and specs that are not *meta* makes it even harder.

[1:21:18] JaseLeland: that's why I play mostly solo. I can't deal with the frustrations of looking for a group
[1:21:26] rLeo2: Thats the life we all plebs gotta live
[1:21:26] N3_Destro: pugged to 3100 almost not to bad pug till you find people you want to play with then friend and push
[1:21:27] Broseidon7624: i gave up trying to do m+. raider io not enough to get invite, or people rage quit from one wipe
[1:21:29] biggie013: Do tanks need to waut aswekk
[1:21:31] biggie013: wait
[1:21:47] stresstest: end game content for sure isnt solo friendly, if you havnet built a relation around a community by the time you reach high keys or higher raid difficulty, its a struggle
[1:21:51] zinbers: It hard as a new casualer player you struggle to find groups
[1:22:03] Vahs_Redclaw: i think the most demoralizing scenario is being in a community who promises to do that, but it turns into 1 group of "the boys" and everyone else is left to pug for themselves
[1:22:16] N3_Destro: hint find good tanks and add them to friend lists
[1:22:46] Pokasquantas: The swiss knife work with that ?
[1:23:00] Zerafuse: Isn't there a gnomish knife that has all engi things?
[1:23:04] Sheckly84: @VAs1andONLY I hate situations like that, where you have the inner "clique" and then everyone else.
[1:23:05] CYNIC308: 40mins to get a group with top tier dps spec ... and you know what you're doing and you are a good player! its even worse for a mediocre casual player on shitty spec dps LUL
[1:23:07] zinbers: The sad things is healers leave as a pug and I play a tanks
[1:23:12] Taldemarr: The army knives are likely to be cheaper and include every profession tool

[1:23:36] Jarlan23: colbalt ore sells for a lot on my server for some reason
[1:23:48] Jarlan23: and people buy it idk why
[1:23:51] Vahs_Redclaw: @VAs1andONLY yeah, the last time i genuinely enjoyed playing this game, not just trying to play cause i felt i need to, i left my guild because 1 of the "clique" members felt it was his duty to just talk trash to me every chance he got
[1:24:02] Vahs_Redclaw: like i was his target for almost no reason he was just one of those guys
[1:24:10] Vahs_Redclaw: i had been friends with the GM for 4+ years
[1:24:23] Vahs_Redclaw: prior to wow
[1:24:24] zinbers: It hard if your coming back and your mri is super low a lot of the people doing high keys rather then low
[1:24:46] Jarlan23: i always liked the way that grey gear looked because i like simple tmogs
[1:25:05] Jarlan23: like the smooth grey shoulders with no spikes or glowy shit on em

[1:43:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Alcast is a great site, it's very accurate
[1:43:17] theDirtyon3: vet trial KEKW
[1:43:21] Morpheusx25: even the norm version would do form rockgrove
[1:43:21] zinbers: So guess who is the current mmorps this year

[1:44:21] Praetour: Its hard if you haven't been doing hard mechanics for 15 years
[1:44:28] Slitze: veteran trials are pretty challenging. definitely need to be in discord and coordinated
[1:44:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of those veteran trials really are hard to do. There's a learning curve
[1:44:43] kodtheog: i didnt like that they nerfed abyss dungeons as early as as they did
[1:44:58] Slitze: ah cool cool so you have a start
[1:45:00] zinbers: I have the list of the top mmos population if anyone is interested

[1:46:52] Morpheusx25: @Slitze indeed rip
[1:47:08] kodtheog: mmo population is so innaccurate lmfao
[1:47:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: You have to take those population numbers with a grain of salt, but I think generally they are right
[1:47:14] Finiin: FF 14
[1:47:46] rymerre: that site is trash
[1:47:51] kodtheog: exactly its so inaccurate
[1:47:52] zinbers: I tried to find accrued website
[1:48:11] kodtheog: lost ark is not the top mmo right now OMEGALUL aint no way
[1:48:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Only the devs and people with server access know the real numbers
[1:48:25] minael1: i miss GW2 :( but i just can't be bothered to play it
[1:48:25] Vahs_Redclaw: with EoD still as new as it is a believe 1/2 mil
[1:48:54] NickyNiclas: PoE is on console
[1:49:00] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee and star citizen is number 7. yeah them numbers are sus
[1:49:01] Finiin: I feel like FF 14 prob has the most playing
[1:49:01] kodtheog: POE above WOW? OMEGALUL
[1:49:15] zinbers: I looked at this it made no sense I was trying to see the lows mmo

[1:49:40] rymerre: lol no
[1:50:01] zinbers: Sorry for posting the wrong website
[1:50:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: You also have to keep in mind they are trying to estimate all the different people who played in a 24 hour period, not all of those are online at once
[1:50:18] kodtheog: new world has 13k on right now not 130k OMEGALUL
[1:50:56] Thoreya: fake news i say
[1:50:56] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100631756-15027263 towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[1:51:00] Morpheusx25: i dont think 130k have logged into NW today lol
[1:51:01] Crawlern: There is at least 2
[1:51:04] kodtheog: it says they peaked at 21k
[1:51:07] kodtheog: today
[1:51:11] kodtheog: on steam
[1:51:12] RavenARPG: It‚Äôs active player. It‚Äôs not about concurrent players right now. It‚Äôs a big difference
[1:51:15] NotEnoughMana: 130k is just ridiculous
[1:51:17] kodtheog: that site just all bad info
[1:51:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe that Lost Ark and FFXIV and OSRS do have a lot of players....but Lost Ark likely has quite a few bots in those numbers
[1:52:02] stealthx23: i can believe 130k looged into new world today that makes sense....like viwership on twitch have 800 people watching now but 200 people have hit you stream today
[1:52:13] stealthx23: 2000*
[1:52:21] kodtheog: so basically its pointless to make a website for it
[1:52:28] BigBusiness: what you think wow numbers are
[1:52:40] andymonkaS: Have you ever thought about downloading AllTheThings? I'm 82% and it's taking over my life!
[1:52:41] Srgskug: @Towelliee do you have both guldan mounts?
[1:53:14] MrPresidentSean: it can also drop on mythic

[1:53:25] ThorH13: hello
[1:53:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: From my experience in WoW pretty much every day for years, there are still a lot of people playing it, it's not as dead as it was last fall, but not close to Shadowlands launch
[1:53:57] Thoreya: ?
[1:54:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: That 1.13 million number for WoW might be right, including China
[1:54:21] kodtheog: i think wow has still a lot of people playing not as much as before but id say its a lot compared to your average mmos
[1:54:30] ThorH13: What we doing atm?
[1:54:34] Finiin: log into wow on right after reset on tuesday and you'll see tons playing still.  Weather they play that much everyday is a different story
[1:54:45] kodtheog: yeah i think wow has a lot more then people realize
[1:54:46] Thoreya: never gonna believe numbers if it isnt coming from wow itself
[1:54:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they do have a huge population
[1:55:31] Crawlern: I loved the 2hour queue we had for firemaw EU last week
[1:55:42] 210Crawler: China has a more extensive WoW population base over than NA?
[1:55:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Officially we hear about MAU's (Monthly Active Users) but those can be a little different
[1:56:02] NinjaChane: 4 million ish seems about right
[1:56:30] kodtheog: wow is deff near 4 million
[1:56:44] Rhonabu: best boss voice lines in the game right there
[1:57:00] Fenundria: I'll be forever sad that I missed out Legion when it was live

[1:58:41] dogapple77: man legacy content in this game have so much potential, not sure why blizzard dont use them
[1:58:45] Jarlan23: windwalkers did not need that big of a buff lol
[1:58:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: 9.2.5 and cross-faction is going to bring some people back, season 4 is going to bring more back

[2:01:35] Wesley1213: Just looked at the WW changes that is INSANE
[2:01:40] Saylore: and not everyone could solo guldsn mythic because of perma stun, but i beleive they fixed it
[2:01:41] RnkRednamals: damn haven't seen your stream in for ever . it's good to see you again
[2:02:01] NinjaChane: have they talked at all about changing the requirements of upgrading gear to tier gear? I know we can do the season 3 gear,  but you think they will lax later in the patch to anything?
[2:02:14] pheezr_: @mrelgaato 50
[2:02:20] Saylore: i hated this boss in legion
[2:02:25] Saylore: WutFace
[2:03:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah a bunch of those are Zereth Mortis mount/pet crafting mats
[2:03:26] Finiin: ZM  crafting crap is killing my bags
[2:03:36] minael1: if this is an item you look for, the blue dragon quests are quick to do, much easier
[2:03:53] zinbers: That would be cool if they do a weekly old raids from vanallia to wod but they redo the mechanics those old raid to get new gear transmog or mounts

[2:30:52] Suzuyuh: Also, I am doing transmog now, good idea.
[2:31:21] Unframed_: wow f2p would be nice and i bet alot more ppl will play it
[2:32:04] Its_Immanis: wow f2p would be killing the golden goose

[2:32:30] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: How's your Memorial Day weekend going? @Towelliee
[2:32:32] NinjaChane: *Phil Spencer enters the stream*
[2:32:38] zinbers: I know this is a stupid question will you give ashes of creation a try or no
[2:32:43] Choowey: f2p signals that the game is dead
[2:33:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You watched the Obi-Wan episodes?
[2:33:32] datmikez: most servers have already merged together though
[2:33:55] MeisterPetze: serverpools
[2:33:59] 210Crawler: We have shards?
[2:34:17] stogetha: need a single mega server lol
[2:34:18] zinbers: Wows never going to die that problem has been going on since 2010
[2:34:22] Its_Immanis: they've connected them in a way that if they ever jumped back up to wrath numbers they could "disconnect" them to get everyone spread back out
[2:34:53] zinbers: It looks cool
[2:34:53] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!

[2:34:54] stogetha: a few mil pop per region
[2:34:56] vimie: Jebaited gottem
[2:35:04] abruptdecayO_O: ashes will never release
[2:35:05] minael1: that will be a disappointment...AOC. i wish i  won't be, but i got no hopes
[2:35:33] zinbers: That star citizen
[2:35:36] Crowargus: i give it 2 years n 300 days lol
[2:35:41] zinbers: Cough cough
[2:35:45] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  rip asmon's investment for AoC lol
[2:35:46] abruptdecayO_O: nah
[2:35:54] Varixous: if it doesent realease you get your money back
[2:35:56] stogetha: it'll be better than new world since there is mounts lol
[2:36:51] Hymirx: If that one guy wouldn‚Äòt have said that the game will come out bug free and without problems I would have taken it seriously, but now i think it will be the same old story. Play for a bit then leave it be
[2:36:52] Unframed_: thats a red flag for me
[2:37:08] MeisterPetze: it will be outdated with the release
[2:37:13] Thoreya: LUL
[2:37:25] stogetha: you'll have grandchildren on release
[2:37:26] mrrazputin: AoC works in 30fps when you have 1 person on server...
[2:37:28] NinjaChane: I believe you said this in a earlier stream, Riot MMO might best AoC to release
[2:37:33] Varixous: gl on drop
[2:37:49] zinbers: I look at is it another escape of tarkov or days z development time the more they work on this game the better things will be
[2:38:17] stogetha: true, forgot about the riot mmo
[2:38:19] Ckn1ght: Theres no way anyone that works on games said they will release something bug free lol
[2:38:25] zinbers: God I hope that game better be good or they got a lot of piss of nerd‚Äôs
[2:38:27] datmikez: this fight was so good on mythic
[2:39:00] Thoreya: World first Pog
[2:39:51] RoboMaximillion: the adds would stun lock you
[2:40:02] burning2bright: well now i want to farm that mount
[2:40:30] Varixous: dont wanna open a sore spot but did you get nalak?
[2:40:31] wisperuna: Did you not get the infernal when it was the time ?
[2:40:46] Hymirx: Remember fury with draught? Kreygasm
[2:40:49] NinjaChane: Unreal 5 just had its full release this month too.
[2:41:36] Cicvara1: Camelot Unchained lol
[2:42:03] tino_sv: I wish SWTOR would have been a real titan, I thought they did an okay job with that one
[2:42:07] Morpheusx25: For AOC we hope for the best but must be prepared for the worst
[2:42:10] wisperuna: @Towelliee Just a  crazy pattern right ?
[2:42:11] datmikez: wildstar needs to rerelease in unreal 5
[2:42:12] tino_sv: but it needed to go FTP
[2:42:20] Varixous: KEKW
[2:42:45] 24sevn: Ashes of creation needs NFTs

[2:43:20] irishwhiskey__: So WoW tokens are 160k right now. They'll be more expensive when Dragonflight launches, right?
[2:43:29] zinbers: Yeah it a stick thing or a new mmo you either have to be goof with a ton of content to substitute till your next expansion or patch or it another failed mmo
[2:44:03] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[2:44:10] Asmilwelmer: hey chat which game is he talking about?
[2:44:14] Ckn1ght: They do the updates too frequrently for something so far from launch still
[2:44:17] tino_sv: AOC
[2:44:18] NinjaChane: Ashes of Creation
[2:44:19] Elwhappo: ya aoc is smelling like star citizen
[2:44:19] Austei: they taking notes from star citizen lol
[2:44:28] Asmilwelmer: thanks chat
[2:45:01] wisperuna: @Towelliee Then most ppl farm up 90% of the content and  subs go down
[2:45:02] ranch72: I thinks stop lots of kids and teens from buying it
[2:45:02] abruptdecayO_O: there is no way unless they turn the hype way up near release
[2:45:06] NinjaChane: New World was doing crazy shit at launch
[2:45:10] abruptdecayO_O: sub plus hella micro transactions?
[2:45:14] tino_sv: At least for me, it also is just a question of time investment. Like I feel as I mature both as a person and a player, it is hard to want to play another game, especially when it's a monthly paywall
[2:45:15] vimie: a new IP asking for a subscription is a tall ask
[2:45:29] Klauzzer: disgusting
[2:45:43] zinbers: It more can they keep those people on that game for 2 to 3 months
[2:45:54] NinjaChane: Absolutely
[2:45:58] QuigsTV: the nighthold infernal is red for me
[2:46:11] QuigsTV: the green one
[2:46:23] zulway_: unless the game is an absolute banger, i think theyre going to go f2p pretty fast
[2:46:26] NinjaChane: It's a marathon not a sprint.  A perfect line for MMOs
[2:46:26] stalpanna: is rarity account based or char based?
[2:46:42] MeisterPetze: is tehre something like in eso for the 15 bucks?
[2:47:11] zinbers: That a dangerous thing because if they have gear in there store then it doomed
[2:47:15] andymonkaS: What node system? @Towelliee
[2:47:20] zulway_: ye agreed
[2:47:20] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[2:47:22] abruptdecayO_O: whats their node system?
[2:47:22] MeisterPetze: note system?
[2:47:30] Ckn1ght: already in development for 11.0 Kappa
[2:47:36] stogetha: wow does all 3. subs box and micro transactions 4Head
[2:47:54] rymerre: thats why companies shouldnt announce anything until a couple years out
[2:48:04] idabien: what do you think will come out first AOC or Riot's MMO?
[2:48:25] Shames285: i honestly want Riots MMO more
[2:48:29] Hey_Im_Bryan: fill me in cause noit sure but are you just gold farming?
[2:48:39] MeisterPetze: jeez
[2:48:41] idabien: @Hey_Im_Bryan mount farming
[2:48:56] rymerre: my kid will graduate college before riots mmo is released
[2:48:59] MeisterPetze: sounds like a mmo to skip
[2:49:00] stogetha: oh my
[2:49:15] zinbers: That not a good sign
[2:49:34] stalpanna: Is rarity character kills or account kills?
[2:49:35] abruptdecayO_O: league and valorant are just skins
[2:49:39] abruptdecayO_O: stores arent bad at all
[2:49:54] trevomancho: @Towelliee not all they have 2 paid ones
[2:50:05] wisperuna: @Towelliee yeah but they are using up to date models for their games
[2:50:07] stealthx23: riot hit nothing but bangers tho...valorant league
[2:50:30] N3_Destro: forgetting team fight tactics
[2:50:44] zinbers: The other thing is are they going to improve the trinity system or are they going to improve on that system in aoc or riots mmo
[2:50:56] greentechx: @Towelliee Sorry if asked but do you play lost ark anymore and if not what turned you off? it still seems kicking even i you remove 200k of bots.
[2:51:09] N3_Destro: sad part is riot said it will be a few years before release

[2:53:57] Complete_Phased: I hope the riot MMO does make waves but a ton of the MMOs that do get released are constantly struggling the deal with power gamers that community perception kinda gets ruined
[2:54:06] NinjaChane: By the time the Riot MMO comes out, unfortunately people will probably forget all that shit with him.
[2:54:23] Thoreya: LUL
[2:54:32] Ckn1ght: Yeah, their legal team definitely got to him on that one lol
[2:55:01] Rottencoarse: riot was : you done fucked up lol. He deserved that tho
[2:55:08] Crowargus: ive seen a few of his recent tweets he seems to be trying to gauge wat ppl are interested in game wise think he did a poll too
[2:55:51] Complete_Phased: I see so many MMOs that focus so hard on PvP that they are basically dead after a month
[2:55:54] abruptdecayO_O: i honestly kinda hope not
[2:56:05] zinbers: Again riot need to pull out something big of there hat to make that mmo stand out instead of copy paste like every other mmo before them
[2:56:09] abruptdecayO_O: classic tbc has taught me i do not care about super extreme end game
[2:56:12] krumthroatpunch: yeah, I love Lost Ark, but there is too much dailies and feel lost if don't get stuff done. casual would be nice lol
[2:56:15] Crowargus: not too recent awhile back i think
[2:56:16] abruptdecayO_O: just the right amoutn of challenge is fine
[2:56:47] tonyr23: tonyr23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 2 month streak!

[2:58:33] Jarlan23: doesnt sound encouraging thats for sure
[2:58:34] rymerre: exactly
[2:58:42] Jarlan23: sounds like theyve barely started or what they had got scrapped
[2:58:46] rymerre: like i said...my kid will graduate college before its released
[2:59:13] Raugdel: It's a wow killer Kappa
[2:59:16] Unframed_: Completion date? when it's done
[2:59:36] Complete_Phased: Embracer might have them beat by a bit
[2:59:48] NinjaChane: I thought Sony was 1
[3:00:04] Complete_Phased: Embracer owns like half the western game studios
[3:00:06] NinjaChane: I thought it was Sony, Tencent, Epic, then MS
[3:00:17] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  who do you think will buy/merge with EA soon?
[3:00:19] Complete_Phased: Epic is under Tencent
[3:00:43] vadergod1980: Microsoft gaming sucks, Playstation
[3:01:00] Complete_Phased: Embracer Group and Tencent are the 2 big parties

[3:02:36] Rottencoarse: as far as mmos its high isle and DF right? @Towelliee

[3:05:24] JakZones: crimson desert isn't an mmo anymore. They said it would be single player with coop features
[3:05:31] Smashbrother: Monsters and Memories is a random MMO that just popped up on my radar recently. I‚Äôm hopeful for that one. Old school MMO style.
[3:06:04] trevomancho: the eks lineage
[3:06:42] WayneG947: so i have to wait until 2028 until AoC comes out to play a decent mmorpg

[3:07:53] Ckn1ght: I'm gonna be dead before Pantheon ever releases

[3:13:49] minael1: but isn't this legion? why not legacy?
[3:13:52] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  wait they didnt legacy legion raids yet?
[3:14:05] fat_european0: @UberManDude The PvE content was really fun. Was hoping to just play it whenever they dropped new content
[3:14:13] taergehtnodnal: Poooound
[3:15:07] MeisterPetze: can i follow like 20 times a day?
[3:15:09] Rottencoarse: probs lmao
[3:15:14] Complete_Phased: @Towelliee do you think they should make old raids more like solo content like mage tower where its challenging for solo players?
[3:15:30] Klauzzer: thats every mount for me
[3:15:35] KingSlayerYotam: tool me 11 attempts D:
[3:15:39] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  just pray that this mount doesnt becomes sha :D
[3:15:53] zilzihan: Hit 9000 attempts on Nalak this week
[3:15:55] trivotix: Did we get the Oondasta mount?

[3:16:24] UberManDude: @o_illusionz Damn, Sorry to hear that. I'm sure the people who worked on that game have different projects going on, ever follow them and see?
[3:16:32] Rottencoarse: @trivotix  he is just missing nalak from MoP
[3:16:44] HagermanHour: i dont think people would like a "solo" 4hr raid experience (week after week)
[3:17:04] minael1: proud loot-goblins, like our lord and saviour bobby
[3:17:13] jaysteea: isnt that the reason for classic?
[3:17:45] Stolhanske: Almost a mythic + for raids? but more challenge mode over increasing difficulty?
[3:17:45] MedicineMan: What's your rep for the enlightened ?
[3:17:55] preheats_lawyer: Man I feel so out of touch. Idk why people want solo content so much when playing an MMO
[3:18:27] Thoreya: Bc mmo is a world, not everything in a world needs to be done with people
[3:18:30] Complete_Phased: the zone not the raid

[3:19:33] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[3:19:37] preheats_lawyer: @Thoreya but the selling point of MMOs is grp content. I feel like if you want solo content, there's games that offer a way better experience than MMOs ever could
[3:19:50] preheats_lawyer: Hot take, but Mage Tower would've been more fun if it was tuned as 3-5 man content
[3:20:09] MedicineMan: trying to figure out the best way to farm the rep

[6:01:53] MeisterPetze: preorder next week?
[6:02:21] corncob78: yeah. i think it's good they are focusing on class vs trying to make a borrowed power system work
[6:02:33] FlexBumpchest: But Ian said he wanted to carry them over. So they wont be in Dragonflight?
[6:03:02] corncob78: good point
[6:03:15] x_Retrospect_x: yeah maybe make items have cooler effects/set bonuses instead of borrowed power

[6:04:47] wickywow: I've been saying ever since legion, that artifact, azerite and soulbinds, literally was talents in disguises. I'm just glad it finally got put back into our class insteads.

[6:06:10] mrelgaato: Make changes to Prot Warrior)
[6:06:22] Jessethoth: I know it's an unpopular opinion but I'm pretty positive, or at least cautiously optimistic all across the board with most of Blizzard's games @Towelliee
[6:06:30] NotEnoughMana: no new tank spec for shaman? ok
[6:06:39] Clappie89: Good Morning @Towelliee from Pennsylvania
[6:06:48] FlexBumpchest: As a full time fury warrior who should be arms, I would love a prot warrior buff
[6:06:49] Jessethoth: I wish they'd fix a few minor issues with Diablo 2 like the character limit and the join time between games BUT they didn't shut down D2 Legacy either so it's still there.
[6:06:50] nullfront: still holding out hope for both getting eye of tyr and divine toll
[6:07:18] Mistery836: w8 what dungeon is this?
[6:07:31] FlexBumpchest: that would be amazing
[6:07:58] FlexBumpchest: but idk what that would do with balance

[6:09:52] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[6:10:06] Jessethoth: Thought it was funny when Tennessee beat the Steelers, I'm a Tennessee boy originally so.
[6:10:11] Noshpan: Sorry, I gotta root for the Raiders
[6:10:51] ShadoodHD: didnt timthetattman stream from the stadium one time lol
[6:10:52] Jessethoth: I like the Raiders, my dad liked that team a lot, he used to pick them all the time in Blitz
[6:10:54] Radtvlol: 2k lol
[6:11:05] szble: steeler nation
[6:11:13] Jessethoth: I just moved back to PA from Washington state 3 years ago.
[6:11:30] Jessethoth: Haven't been back home to Tennessee in like.....8 years?
[6:11:48] Sionz: Good Morning
[6:11:59] Jessethoth: I love tanking, but I do prefer Threat based tanking to Mitigation based. BUT I'm a prot warrior main.
[6:12:07] Jessethoth: Most people hate how they were thrown out @Towelliee
[6:12:23] PvtHudson093: dom shards and sockets felt the worst
[6:12:34] MeisterPetze: hope there is the signet for warriors
[6:12:34] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Borrowed power to me is a dumb thing to complain about, I just personally hate throwing the shit out. I think it adds more depth to keep it all
[6:12:44] Jessethoth: @Towelliee BUT some people also like a more shallow game.
[6:12:48] corncob78: i think its the bullshit grind and stuff hidden behind timegating
[6:12:48] Hjolt: im in
[6:12:54] Jessethoth: @Towelliee DUDE I'd be so happy if we got corruptions back
[6:13:05] TheCliffyShow: I hope the new talent trees for rogue include flagellation.
[6:13:11] gideonthecrusader: tvilight devistation PTSD kicking in
[6:13:27] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Imagine if you could equip a regular weapon, AND your Artifact, and you had like 5 abilities that power up over time.
[6:13:37] Jessethoth: @Towelliee And like those abilities only work with the Artifact.
[6:13:41] PvtHudson093: TD PTSD in Tol Dagor
[6:13:59] Tokki211: I wish there was way to get gear other than dungeons and raids
[6:14:03] Hjolt: i dont think we need to see a roulette galore of rng in talent trees.
[6:14:12] PvtHudson093: Divine Toll every time
[6:14:23] just_ie: Idk all of shamans covenant abilities isn't really in the shaman fantasy
[6:14:35] TheCliffyShow: For rogues there is only one option...flagellation.
[6:14:43] PvtHudson093: sadworn relics
[6:14:56] MVRD: @Tokki211 zereth mortis and you get gear up to m+12, theres to much LULW
[6:14:57] Jessethoth: @Tokki211 That's been the game for 18 years
[6:15:00] MeisterPetze: grind your honor gear and your are fuckin fine for everything openworld
[6:15:07] klindatu: Do you think the new talent tree system will affect the mage tower difficulty or will they just block half of the trees from working in there?
[6:15:23] OverPoweredGG: Towelliee I think he means top 3 BiS gear only
[6:15:26] Deaglenest: rogue has several viable covenant abilities
[6:15:29] Arms_Warrior: 2 raid difficulties would be best imo
[6:15:31] Deaglenest: xm
[6:15:31] ShadoodHD: methods to get upgrade gear is too dam high cohhOld
[6:15:33] Jessethoth: @Tokki211 MOST people who originally played preferred when Raid gear was the big dick gear.
[6:15:53] Deaglenest: flag, Kyrian ability, sepsis
[6:15:55] Sionz: What about an ingame color scheme for recoloring Transmog?
[6:16:20] Jessethoth: @Tokki211 You have to reward people that are THAT committed otherwise they won't play your game.
[6:16:29] TheCliffyShow: @Deaglenest I hated the kyrian rogue ability when I was leveling through Bastion.
[6:16:34] mrsuflakis: get rid of noobz
[6:16:36] ShadoodHD: what wow also needs is another community puzzle Kappa
[6:16:38] Sionz: yes
[6:16:47] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Did you see the idea I had about Artifacts being equippable WITH regular weapons and having their own ability set that sort of charges up?
[6:16:57] TheCliffyShow: WoW's armor isn't set up for dying.
[6:17:00] Tokki211: I just find that now that most of my friends have stopped playing its so hard to get a decent pickup and get good gear without wasting so much time
[6:17:07] Hjolt: you are bold to assume we have the 5 friends
[6:17:08] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Right? Yet I think it'd be fun AF
[6:17:08] Hjolt: Kappa
[6:17:20] Jessethoth: @Towelliee RIGHT? How are gems not just borrowed power?
[6:17:46] Prideinlife: is having 5 friends borrowed power ü§î
[6:18:15] johnnythunderbunny: imagine having friends
[6:18:20] mrelgaato: lul
[6:18:33] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I dunno, I say, bring all the borrowed power in you want just "flavor" it to the class themes.
[6:18:43] TheCliffyShow: I love puzzle world quests in WoW.
[6:18:57] Arms_Warrior: give them another waist of time to keep em occupied
[6:18:58] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!

[6:20:36] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Legion WQ's were the best
[6:20:46] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: bring back the pvp tower WQs too
[6:20:56] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Isn't it odd? Legion WQ's FELT different to me. I dunno why they were more enjoyable.
[6:21:04] nyliah: if only it was interesting steps
[6:21:06] QuigsTV: @Towelliee same its annoying af
[6:21:10] binkz77: was for shadowlands are cancer
[6:21:11] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee's like, "Just give me my shit!"
[6:21:11] NieIas: i have barely done wq's in shadowlands cba doing 3-4  steps
[6:21:22] binkz77: wqs
[6:21:24] Tr1ckrTreat: @Jessethoth i feel the same
[6:21:40] Metket: @Towelliee also for collecting reasons in the future i mean like all the things ppl, having needed more then 1 ppl to spawn a mob is really bad idea for outworld things
[6:21:50] wickywow: WQ isnt fun to begin with it. Rather give me something like suramaar or Isle of thunder where the story progresses.
[6:21:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: KEKW REAL
[6:21:57] Bugszy: hahahahaha

[6:23:07] Seltherius: i don't understand how people can even grind for rare soulshapes. We won't be able to use them next Xpac anyway. Same with azerite powers i couldn't be arsed doing the rank 4 ones knowing the same thing.
[6:23:16] binkz77: bis trinket for casters

[6:24:04] Farsite: @Towelliee Did you know you can buy full set of gear for Anima in Haven?
[6:24:06] Bugszy: yep
[6:24:07] NotEnoughMana: you can send the gear i think
[6:24:16] klindatu: so we dont get any new sources for genesis motes in 9.2.5? nothing from WQ, chests, daylie quests at all? very sad
[6:24:48] dracullus: you can just buy 1000 anima tokens and send to alt without losing any
[6:25:08] Elrom_77: Hey Towelliee, do you play Destiny 2? Were you playing off stream yesterday?
[6:25:26] Sionz: Do you think there is too much grinding in Zereth Mortis to make all of the mounts?
[6:25:27] Armdel: 3 hours of farming the best spot would give you more than one mount though
[6:25:29] QuigsTV: white shirt will blue sleeves and the sleeves are short like a baseball shirt. I was asking cause it looks like the fender logo
[6:25:34] nullfront: I'm fine with the motes as they are now, if they'd just buff the vespoid lattice drop rate though
[6:25:54] Arms_Warrior: they loved that mount creation so much they had to make it 24 mounts

[6:30:16] propoopimus: i got my augment rune on main and never went back
[6:30:21] nullfront: I wish the dailies in ZM gave rep enlightened is such a slow grind
[6:30:31] PrimalBF: Yeah, Still a good line though
[6:30:35] Metket: oh yeah blizzard is really casual friendy as f, they said we are not gonna add new getting x amount of mount achievements cause only %4 of the ppl who has 400 mounts, while casually adding 500 honor level achievement KEKW
[6:30:55] NVbrutal: i hit revered and never went back lol
[6:31:27] akia03: untill sandworn relics become boa no reason to go back
[6:31:44] Siimba: Is sparty still raiding ?
[6:31:52] Ghamera: is mount farming considered a "non-casual" activity? @Metket
[6:31:57] mrelgaato: @Siimba yep
[6:32:13] NVbrutal: flux needs to be account wide, hopefully they will throw that into the patch notes before tuesday.
[6:32:20] johnnythunderbunny: yeah i have about 500000 of them rotting
[6:32:27] Metket: @Ghamera what does casuals do? mythic jailor?
[6:32:40] qtceef: I just delete the relics
[6:32:42] qtceef: bag space
[6:32:45] myStiC_o: Yeah the SW Relics didnt really hit. It would have been a great system if they were BoA
[6:33:13] nullfront: sand worn is catch up though
[6:33:26] Sionz: Alt's are a huge part of the game
[6:33:32] ThatGuyFayde: the currency should be used for other things if he thinks like that
[6:33:57] propoopimus: it just seems petty, like they want you to grind on another char to extend game time
[6:34:05] ThatGuyFayde: cash it in or rep or something
[6:34:29] binkz77: hopefully Ian is looking for a new job when Microsoft takes over
[6:35:04] PvtHudson093: unbound changling changes its stgats depending on the ffod you eat except Verse
[6:35:40] PvtHudson093: i think haste is default
[6:35:49] corncob78: anything below heroic gear should be account bound?
[6:36:07] TheCliffyShow: I want account-wide bank.
[6:36:08] Sylphy_TV: What Covenant is good for Brewmaster (Very Casual gaming)
[6:36:08] propoopimus: i gotta get me some ffod this morning too
[6:36:10] akia03: he might just step back from public stuff
[6:36:52] Infebdo: by the time I got enough sandworm relics I had better gear
[6:36:58] dneario: do you use an addon manager?
[6:37:04] placuszekdobrenick: New World will be play ? )
[6:37:15] QuigsTV: @Sylphy_TV the best for M+ is kyrian. I believe raid is necro but if youre doing very casual it shouldnt matter too much
[6:37:31] TheCliffyShow: Still hate the name Dragonflight. I would have preferred if they called it simply Dragon Isles.

[6:44:37] TheCliffyShow: Illusions have been shattered.
[6:44:46] TJAB0: Is that why so many fanatics have so much money, they want miracles?
[6:45:00] francescothepainter: Money usually only aids in extending a development cycle

[6:46:42] Jessethoth: I feel like Microsoft is a good thing, they're hands off and the teams will probably be given more reasonable deadlines.
[6:47:05] TJAB0: MS makes many of the tools for devs and game devs
[6:47:39] belfastcl: since microsoft acquisition, ESO has seen visible two changes: a way of getting store items through game play (endeavors) and an upgrade of all PC-NA server hardware

[6:49:29] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I think they understand what a shitstorm software development is, add to that the aspect of it being art as well. Microsoft gets it better than Slacktivision does.

[6:56:35] squishalan: I heard immortal has more endgame than diablo 3 but has a cash shop advantage for those who want to spend.
[6:57:07] Jessethoth: Immortal definitely has more than Diablo 3. It's slightly MMO lite flavored compared to D3 being pure ARPG.

[7:18:30] Robix256: we didn't want to pay for the faction change, I've left him behind when we transfered in S2

[7:22:13] brentosxd: yep if you ask to try out the game again you get like 3 free days
[7:22:25] fistofnature: @Tyrou the only good racial you listed is troll, and thats only for ST raid scenario

[7:32:49] tedol: it's already 14.00....
[7:32:58] DisparagingTurtle: 14 days is a good ballpark number too. Long enough to get some gear with the catchup mechanics, and get a little committed to a toon/the game

[7:36:56] MediumRareOG: The BFA apology tour
[7:37:09] Hononoe: can someone please tell me the name of this mount  ?
[7:37:12] Hononoe: he s mounting
[7:37:14] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Wrath was the beginning of the casualization of the game.
[7:37:18] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Wrath babies became a term for a reason KEKW
[7:37:19] SlideCancelXDD: @Towelliee no a lot of Classic players are excited to raid on multiple toons
[7:37:26] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Splitting raids into easier and harder versions definitely.
[7:37:29] PhoenixAuTv: Kappa
[7:37:32] kimmo_gaming: I mean from 1-80 you can get in like 4 days or so
[7:37:32] Terakz: corruption was fun, too bad they had rotations on the vendor

[7:38:21] abracka_: i'm just looking forward to paladin pvp in wrath
[7:38:33] DisparagingTurtle: Laugh at me all you want, I just want Panda Classic. I loved that expansion
[7:38:34] Unframed_: and bet you they will complain again when its out and they finish it within 3 days
[7:38:38] Unframed_: its on them
[7:38:50] Jessethoth: I say, keep one of every version so everyone can fuck off to whichever they prefer, the sub money still supports Retail.
[7:38:54] Unframed_: who cares if its easy or easier, just enjoy the game
[7:39:02] Cramer: wrath heroics were a joke so is naxx 25
[7:39:03] Jarless: no
[7:39:16] dldrzoidberg: first day i hit 80 i did all 80 hcs with 70 epic gear

[7:40:19] tedol: wasn't Cata to Mop longer?
[7:40:22] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HFC to Legion???
[7:40:23] Cramer: a big chunk of the community just did naxx in classic a year ago, they need to do something to spice it up
[7:40:35] tedol: oh,ok
[7:40:37] Jessethoth: Makes me glad I lost my internet for 3 or 4 months a couple of times then.
[7:40:45] DisparagingTurtle: def HFC
[7:40:46] Arms_Warrior: dragon soul lasted long too
[7:41:06] Jessethoth: Glad I dodged that trash can. 4.3 can ligma.
[7:41:14] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: naxx was only like 4-5 months
[7:41:16] PvtHudson093: dont need to, I remember trying to get Immortal with other people having shitty net connections

[7:45:00] Rudric_Ice: @Zettabyte u think bobby gonna leave ?
[7:45:02] Jessethoth: Of course not
[7:45:13] Jessethoth: But it's a metric for how much leveling there is to do....
[7:45:22] Jessethoth: 5 hours in SL = to 17 hours in BFA
[7:45:35] Jessethoth: Like I got 5 chars to 60 in a few days spamming dungeons.
[7:45:47] N3llee: he wont have a choice.. share holders will vote him out soon

[7:46:49] abracka_: i thought he was in wow as gallywix though
[7:46:58] Terakz: i think one of the major shareholders wanted every other shareholder to vote no for Bobby and the rest of the board
[7:46:59] Zettabyte: "I don't play World of Warcraft. I have a LIFE!" KEKW
