[0:49:03] babusch09: oo Swifty....... think about that. 80 to 90% of the audience at your venue is male, right? So a box machine would be a magnet for all types :;)) .A free idea from me to you
[0:49:10] DaddySinpie: It's an arcade buffet
[0:49:27] Capnrein: idk why people go to the pay by card arcades. costs like $60 for an hour of gametime then you have to buy more
[0:49:35] babusch09: yees
[0:49:41] Blupvis: Sounds very cool!
[0:50:09] Capnrein: each machine ends up costing like $2-3 per play if you think about it

[2:24:32] poggeringthelair: that was tbc @As_l_lay_dying
[2:24:48] bigmegasludge: Does dying at 60 result in losing the character as well?
[2:25:34] bigmegasludge: Tough
[2:26:15] poggeringthelair: kinda sad blizz removed your ingame character in Ashran. im still mad about that
[2:26:58] bondigger: @sumdinsumdin I think you can transfer it to another server
[2:27:45] skwiglz: gened wilder tho =(
[2:27:45] poggeringthelair: he had his own Swifty npc in Ashran
[2:27:52] jenna_ria: arent the trolls blood potions kinda dangerous?
[2:27:53] bigmegasludge: @bondigger Ahh I see, thank you

[2:30:37] BoricuaSJ: When u hooked up you game console there the 1st time
[2:30:53] jenna_ria: the healing you get from the potion while in the radius of a mob adds you to their "combat table" or whatever, meaning you can get aggro
[2:31:12] skillxraw: might be able to in HC :D
[2:31:46] poggeringthelair: Payo is also leveling a gnome warrior too xD

[2:32:52] poggeringthelair: so beware of any horde guards
[2:33:27] Wendigo567: What server do you play on @swifty
[2:33:30] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:33:39] Chappell_gaming: Have you officially got the place now ?
[2:33:56] poggeringthelair: and the neutral bootybay/ratchet/gadgetzan guards also attack you if you are in combat in those zones. ive seen people hs there in combat then the guards killed them
[2:34:24] jenna_ria: be careful with that potion, chances are when someone runs past you with a bunch of mobs, they'll aggro you
[2:34:34] jenna_ria: the amount of times that happened to me lol
[2:34:57] Antero94: @poggeringthelair only if you are pvp flagged

[2:35:59] poggeringthelair: is that a hc thing specifically? never heard of that
[2:36:26] ElcRcp: hmm, so, no one getting into dungeons while leveling since there is a higher change of dying. And also no one goes to raids after 60 since it is certain to die there ResidentSleeper  so what is the point of lvlng 60 here NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:36:29] poggeringthelair: i mean the aggro from the trolls blood potions
[2:36:38] Mathias0910: ***
[2:36:58] Mathias0910: yo swifty!
[2:37:06] Toiarc: What if blizzard dev come up with hardcore just so 2/5 of playerbase would play endlessly?
[2:37:13] jenna_ria: LUL Guess I've been extremely unlucky. Player runs past me with 3 mobs on them, my trolld blood potion procs = heal, added to the combat table = aggro
[2:37:34] salty_1988: the big prob is the dcÂ´s for 3-4 seconds to reloging...i die on 47 and now on 51 because that...and you cant do something
[2:37:38] xmedpakx: hopefully thel ayer changed but i might be on the same one
[2:37:40] poggeringthelair: his npc was in Ashran in wod. as a boss for the alliance.
[2:37:43] jenna_ria: not trolling I promise lmao just traumatized hahaa good thing I was a rogue
[2:37:46] Vadagar1: Once you hit 60 you fall into Blackrock Volcano just like in LOTR and roll the credits.
[2:37:57] Drascho27: @ElcRcp Wrong, people do dungeons and people do raid after 60 in hc. Very common.

[3:25:36] ykwdota: no starfield isnt fun
[3:25:44] ykwdota: just another bland modern gaming title
[3:25:54] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Well, you can build your own ship with s*** parts. I didn't see people build a ton of different ships from Star wars and Star Trek as well as a base building
[3:26:01] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: You can build your own outpost on any planet you choose
[3:26:03] GoreScum: You gonna try the NW expansion October?
[3:26:05] ykwdota: no, its a bad no mans sky
[3:26:10] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: That's mainly how people are getting experience in materials as well as money
[3:26:37] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: With *ship parts
[3:26:56] ykwdota: @poggeringthelair ye, fallout 76
[3:27:14] GoreScum: Pilots license is super damn expensive to even get the license
[3:27:18] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Somebody literally made millennium falcon. There's like three different variants from three different people that built them in starfield
[3:27:35] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: As well as some of the other ships in Star wars like a star destroyer is a couple different variants of those people have built
[3:28:24] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Somebody made a space truck with all that was on. It was storage containers
[3:29:01] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso go.corsair.com/XYOjza

[3:30:21] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Why would they patch it? That's what I'm confused about
[3:30:29] bondigger: lol
[3:30:30] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: It's a single player game so if someone wants to do that and ruin their gameplay go ahead in my opinion
[3:30:40] SCHLEMM: someone needs to make a Halo ship
[3:30:40] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: It's not like a multiplayer game where so my mods in something that changes the game entirely for themselves and makes everybody edit disadvantage
[3:30:42] elsiefleur: thats hilarious
[3:30:46] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: So to be honest my opinion they shouldn't patch it
[3:30:49] xichell: nerds my friend
[3:31:00] myst_wow: it amazes me how players figure some stuff out, like for example the team in wow that found lucid nightmare or other stuff
[3:31:47] HappyTuckerr: @LegendarySamuraiZenKai It literally breaks a chunk of the game they spent so much time working on. 10/10 should be patched
[3:32:01] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:32:03] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: The thing is don't focus on the people patrolling outside the ship still it as soon as you can cuz it can fly off before you get inside it
[3:32:11] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: I saw a guy put up a video of him getting ready to still s*** that he saw that landed
[3:32:14] myst_wow: do you still play chess Swifty?
[3:32:23] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: And he focused on killing the guys around it after like 15 minutes it flew away
