[0:33:49] stevenn23: make it at least 1000 its the wall of founders
[0:33:51] dragonoff18: 500 minimum
[0:34:05] astrberg: Cap the number of life time memberships, maybe to a 100x?
[0:34:06] Ragna677: Could make the lifetime pass look like a legendary item. Gold border, orange text and a achievement box that says something cool
[0:34:09] chewwtv: Like if all your locals came in a spent $100 that would be a bad thing. Kinda like you were saying
[0:34:09] Jakmuiz: $200 max. Get the customers in the door and sell them more tokens and food
[0:34:11] LegendCG1: Lifetime at least 500 I would say. Founder wall 1000

[0:35:36] Galdrena: laynards for family members?
[0:35:46] stevenn23: you said you want to put la 10$ per entrance multiply that with 365 days and you got 3650$ per year
[0:35:49] Jakmuiz: lifetime membership max of $200. Getting people coming back is not a bad thing. Just sell them tokens
[0:35:55] nashonatorrr: sounds like your giving  it away
[0:35:58] stevenn23: i think 500/1000$ its ok for lifetime
[0:36:23] astrberg: Are u gonna serve alcohol?
[0:36:51] dragonoff18: at 250 life time ill move to your local area.
[0:37:10] stevenn23: it is much but its lifetime
[0:37:22] neevir: 100 for lifetime for the first 500 people

[0:37:57] AnniMattR: I think a lifetime pass is not a good business strat. A yearly membership would be worth it, like the parks
[0:37:57] Vladeimir: steebzMinty
[0:38:00] bythelightx: whats the 10 dollars for, is that like a cover fee
[0:38:02] nashonatorrr: if its an NFT you would get a cut when they sell it
[0:38:06] Ragna677: Could make the lifetime pass look like a legendary item. Gold border, orange text and a achievement box that says something cool
[0:38:09] Sdeleon159: swiftySTARE
[0:38:23] snuffles_80: So it will be a entrance fee but the games are free?
[0:38:29] bythelightx: oh okay
[0:38:32] Galdrena: yes @snuffles_80
[0:38:41] bythelightx: i like that idea better tbh

[0:38:57] snuffles_80: That's sounds great
[0:39:02] endtrails: That’s crazy!!! Such a better design then the out dated board walk re charge cards
[0:39:05] Galdrena: @Sdeleon159 galdreHeart
[0:39:24] toxicwaff: Swifty this sounds utopian! Ithink 500 would be fair.
[0:39:32] stevenn23: you can put an extra fee for the pc and VR
[0:39:35] stevenn23: Maintanance
[0:39:36] Eunit: Local, Craft beer...will be very good long term swifty
[0:39:46] snuffles_80: If it's free then 10$ entrance is too little :)
[0:39:47] bythelightx: lifetime membership being 300 is reasonable to me, 500 is a bit much
[0:40:08] AnniMattR: 60 dollar yearly pass
[0:40:13] bythelightx: or do 300 as a year pass/500 as a lifetime pass
[0:40:19] endtrails: Half is great start!
[0:40:23] Jakmuiz: If you are charging $500-$1000  for lifetime, give an ID card with a photo so they can't share it
[0:40:43] LitheHS: A VR station might have a good return. you can get one of them for maybe $700 and charge $15/15 minutes or something
[0:40:54] astrberg: DNA
[0:41:19] AnniMattR: Throwback Jai Alai Heroes would be a local favorite
[0:41:21] bythelightx: i really like the idea of a cover fee and everything is free excluding drinks
[0:41:26] Eunit: you should be asking every time for ID (legally) for Bar concept either way @Swifty
[0:41:30] WOOPsWOOP: cool
[0:42:12] Bhain: What server is @Swifty on?
[0:42:22] Galdrena: !hcserver
[0:42:22] StreamElements: Swifty is on Skullrock server for official hardcore servers
[0:42:24] lordcillas: you server?
[0:42:30] Eunit: so asking for ID for the lifetime could be part of that ID
[0:42:34] chewwtv: Offer incentives. $100 lanyard can get you this inside the arcade & $250 lanyard gets you a bit more. Like a package deal for however long you want the package deal to last.
[0:42:40] lordcillas: SeemsGood
[0:42:59] JattixTV: Whats up John, so I made a rogue. Gonna need an inv to guild lol

[5:22:55] JFury11: I mean in SL peopele were like 3500
[5:23:00] jacob_the_mage: I can focus on m+ until the second half then maybe?
[5:23:38] lorde_purps: Is there a reason you rolled gnome?
[5:23:45] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:23:50] nextlevelgamingpcs: i guess cause pvp is low low population now
[5:23:59] nextlevelgamingpcs: they say pvp is dying
[5:24:01] jacob_the_mage: M+ is based off how you time eys
[5:24:03] jacob_the_mage: keys*
[5:24:09] nextlevelgamingpcs: no
[5:24:12] SeanBon45: no
[5:24:13] nextlevelgamingpcs: locked
[5:24:13] therealbroli: you can get as much rating as possiple, but the ilvl of the gear is limited week 1
[5:24:18] jacob_the_mage: no cuz its based off tyrannical and fortified scores
[5:24:19] brayley16: no
[5:24:22] funkytownman21: nah you can't because there's 2 types of keys, tyrannical and fortified
[5:24:23] NickH2K: 2nd week if youre cracked
[5:24:29] jacob_the_mage: so you need 2 weeks minimum I thought
[5:24:38] nextlevelgamingpcs: you need to do dungeons on fort and tyrannical
[5:24:43] brayley16: totally
[5:24:44] nextlevelgamingpcs: yea depending on the weeks
[5:24:48] brayley16: within the first month
[5:24:55] jacob_the_mage: I got my KSM in 2 weeks S4 shadowlands after getting high scores tyrannical and fortified
[5:24:58] nextlevelgamingpcs: true big true
[5:25:15] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:25:22] brayley16: its really hard to get alot of m+ rating without the gear which is why you cant push higher keys
[5:25:31] brayley16: cause things are just too hard to kill and do to much dmg
[5:25:32] jacob_the_mage: But I heard arena was a big slog fest cuz of what swifty said... rough when all the glads pushing in 1800
[5:25:59] nextlevelgamingpcs: wow pvp is dying pve is alive and strong
[5:26:27] nextlevelgamingpcs: too hard for people i guess lol
[5:26:34] merrytownsman: djoker
[5:26:43] jacob_the_mage: I had to swap from dps to healer in both pve and pvp to get ques
[5:26:53] guiltysinz: I went Rank 1 3 times only in Season 1 2 and 3 of Vanilla (TBC), still got all 3 glad Flying Mounts
[5:27:02] jacob_the_mage: aside from shuffle I dont do that as healer its too hard
[5:27:21] merrytownsman: 1/12 adds
[5:27:45] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso go.corsair.com/XYOjza
[5:27:46] guiltysinz: I think the last mount was the Brutal Drake
[5:27:54] Griff_666: LOL
[5:29:16] jacob_the_mage: Swifty do you plan on doing any M+ in season 3 of DF if shuffle ques are really slow?
[5:29:26] drunkwerewolfdud: Gnome warrior! My man!
[5:30:06] jacob_the_mage: Would love to watch you try and get the KSM mount for M+ but Idk if you like doing it
