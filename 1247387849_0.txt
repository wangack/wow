[3:56:46] bonkyouded: bonkyouded subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:56:48] StreamElements: bonkyouded just subscribed PogChamp
[3:57:04] Lucbass: the irony of som is the only changes are raid difficulties and barely anyone is raiding
[3:57:05] JakeyC: 1 big megaserver PogChamp
[3:57:07] Enmael00: its futile to raid... good luck getting 40 people to do MC and all its attunement that is NOT NERFED btw
[3:57:08] Darkdeaths: i know i have an issue with no balance changes for the WHOLE release of classic. its just one spec most of the time
[3:57:17] xevyn808: is lionheart AU still a thing? lol
[3:57:19] tamilveeran: Blizz should 1. Increase drop rates 2. Give gear easily and 3. Let leveling be faster
[3:57:28] Spart4nm4n: did you ever see this video? i loved this fight scene in far from home. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGHiCE2XlYo

[3:58:02] Bewildfire: I’m currently stuck at 58.
[3:58:02] fartplugger: TRUE
[3:58:13] johngalang6: when does the leveling start to slow down? after lvl 10?
[3:58:15] kryppwax: they should give more xp per mob not only quests
[3:58:23] crakajaxx: I enjoy the leveling the most
[3:58:24] MitchellScot: if your character is going to be deleted after 1 year... just break the game and let the players have fun
[3:58:53] naughtynatexxx: Do u have tbc at all?
[3:59:17] Bewildfire: I lost interest. Maybe I’ll continue
[3:59:19] xevyn808: do you just run AV for honor grinding?
[3:59:25] Darkdeaths: i think wow classic needs to have class balance changes to change up specs and make it more interesting
[3:59:29] Lucbass: 40-50 seemed to take a long time

[4:05:13] Jlo1868: They should do this for retail but without loosing rank even if it takes 1 or 2 monts more with all sets and everything
[4:05:20] shironu: alliance eu got now queues from 40 - 50 mins ...
[4:05:26] xevyn808: how does no decay affect the system long term?
[4:05:30] shironu: so yeah each hour like 4k honor

[6:34:42] rpivs: The leveling grind seems easy compared to R14
[6:34:46] Vexuzzz: they should have doubled the RP gain like they did but not changed the decay so people could be casual/have a job and still enjoy ranking

[6:43:15] TootsieTee: After SOM do the characters just move to normal servers?
[6:43:34] Gizimoo86: SoM has small amount of players when comparing to classic launch
[6:43:39] tamilveeran: I havent seen any Grand Marshals or High Warlords in the game??
[6:43:50] CryonicBlue: They are most likely deleted

[6:46:47] Vexuzzz: you think they give the option to take the toon into tbc ?
[6:47:00] derpybee93: im surprised people want another season of mastery.
[6:47:07] derpybee93: idk how you could do the same grind 4 times
[6:47:18] HolyRagnar: yo Swifty hermano, who made the greatest comeback RDJ or Preachs hair ?
[6:47:41] svepito: The only way they keep TBC alive is if they allow SoM characters to go there
[6:47:43] sonartwitchtv: They should
[6:47:44] tamilveeran: yeah why not to tbc, the classic toon gear will be only good for 60 and then outland any way you have to level
[6:47:44] Bgarrison1: in a year we can transfer this SOM toons to TBC
[6:47:47] xmedpakx: TBC season of mastery
[6:47:52] ryanblue98: im waiting for WOD season of mastery Kappa
[6:47:53] Vexuzzz: you think they give the option to take the toon into tbc ?
[6:48:08] alsorrr: TBC will be over when SoM ends tho

[6:48:32] WeAreALLhuman: danBobble SourPls
[6:48:40] evittagaming: all your honor are belong to us
[6:48:41] dasdoody: Seasonal, means they are doing something different every season. Just like D3. It won't be called SoM next it will be season of "x"
[6:49:10] tamilveeran: you mean Wrath CLassic not tbc classic
[6:49:11] slavo_vlavo: you mean wotlk
[6:49:11] vanillasky7788: season of mash potatoes
[6:49:15] KatusTV: Barman Shanker es el reino con mas horda pero de seguro Jom Gabbar sera el que termine con mas gente

[6:49:22] derpybee93: would you do a second SOM?
[6:49:25] Enmael00: Is someone REALLY crazy enough to do another season 2 of SOM?
[6:49:26] Bgarrison1: SOM Toons will be able to transfer to TBC servers but they are dropping WOTLK end of next year

[6:50:05] Enmael00: ^he didn't stop playing alliance... he took a ...BREAK
[6:50:06] alsorrr: and then we will see Arthas cinematic and get chills Kreygasm
[6:50:14] tamilveeran: if all you streamers have already done this 2wice, there isnt anything new to do here
[6:50:20] typhoxtv: a cool idea for SOM 2 would be tbc talents

[8:57:45] x_VORA_x: is it better to lvl in a low pop server?
[8:57:53] DekRemzD: at the start like 3-4 hours minimum because you had to wait on respawns, especially for named mobs
[8:57:58] Vendetta285: the starting zones are pretty empty now. so it doesnt take that long
[8:58:04] megaxxstreams: If you take more then 2 hours to get to 5 your not leveling right

[9:09:09] f1skegarn: ranked to 14 in classic, sure was a grind. But the most mentally draining was the drama and politics concerning brackets and stuff for me
