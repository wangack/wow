[0:52:39] Cowardpatty: The best thing about the new UI is that if you find yourself on a PC with no addons, you can recreate a lot of addon funtionality.  But I will still choose addons over the default UI.
[0:52:42] unsolved_return: I find it disgusting , I HATE this new UI and everything about it

[3:19:51] MikeSpoonz: @Swifty Okay I found the option for it, for raid style Party frames, go to edit mode click that party box & in the sub menu options, click "Raid style party Frames".  Okay now for numbers back on the health bars, apparently the search doesn't work,    go to "Interface" scroll down to "Status Text". Click that box & select "Numeric Values" That should put the health amounts back on the health bars, energy, mana etc. Hope that helps! It's kind of convoluted, they need to enhance the search a bit

[3:20:24] michaeleu: try /console floatingCombatTextCombatDamage 1

[3:23:36] michaeleu: yes
[3:23:49] michaeleu: yep
[3:23:50] NickDryle: ye
[3:24:45] michaeleu: yeah the damage seems crazy
[3:25:10] Disemble: @Swifty  u know the general population hates when people q up for solo q as tank right? do what u want but people arent happy about it lol
[3:25:51] NickDryle: What's the mount % progress in solo shuffle wins?
[3:26:22] Cowardpatty: If healers can queue, no reason tanks shouldn't be able to.
[3:26:49] Cybernytez: idk hy people hate tanks in solo shuffle makes no sense both sides have a tank
[3:26:49] eclipseottv: cant get mount anymore season is over
[3:27:12] michaeleu: tanks in pvp should be a thing
[3:27:19] michaeleu: do less dmg but take more dmg
[3:27:20] Ralffeh: people dont like playing with or against tanks, I think they're gonna get banned from rated solo shuffle
[3:27:22] Kunxion: can you go healer/dps?
[3:27:23] michaeleu: its fun in pvp to have it
[3:27:29] Kunxion: dps spec thats good at healing ?
[3:27:35] Cowardpatty: I'd rather fight a tank than a healer.  I hate healers.
[3:27:37] GhostVenn: Should I think he was saying
[3:27:40] michaeleu: no man , i said SHOULD

[3:28:27] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:28:36] Ralffeh: the difference in tanks is too big, blood dks and guardian druid offer no utility at all so they're completely useless in shuffle, and prot palas are way too good
[3:28:44] asiostygius9: @swifty are you also smashing buttons harder when some enemy low hp?
[3:28:57] justjoshingyo: are we ever going to have another flyplatebuffs =\
[3:28:57] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:29:01] Cybernytez: yeah the prepatch is definetly not a representation of the reality of dragonflight LUL
[3:29:15] erik_ma: sure - smashing harder = more dmg
[3:29:17] NickDryle: What I meant before is that Rated Solo Arena gives some % progress on Vicious Saddles. Wondering if that's 1.25% like 3v3 arenas.
[3:30:32] michaeleu: ppl seem to get nuked just
[3:30:35] michaeleu: in pvp now
[3:30:49] Shrandamar: Not sure, viscious progress for solo shuffle is bugged atm, at least on EU
[3:30:52] Cybernytez: im a healer and i will not que this until i have real raid frames ^^ i need to see debuffs and other stuff

[5:17:30] Warstotem: solo shuffling is too unpredictable, you have to rely on other players too much
[5:17:32] honorius3: good to see u
[5:17:44] Cybernytez: yeah i dont think the 75 or 90 points lose is intended
[5:17:47] michaeleu: 0bviously u should just lose kind of the same as u can win
[5:17:57] michaeleu: right now u can lose 75 but only win like 30 lol

[5:19:31] Lancin1987: the problem is when people leave right before game ends so they dont lose any rating, screws everyone else
