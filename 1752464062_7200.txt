[2:43:30] abracka_: add a vote abandon
[2:43:38] paulson14: umm no trolls
[2:43:46] JaeDee: thats like ranked in valorant and every other game
[2:43:47] Jarwerewolf: hell no

[2:44:02] Phayntt: thats a dumb boomkin take from him
[2:44:05] tchikaboom: if 4/5 votes to abandon but otherwise we'll have a shit ton of griefers
[2:44:10] GingerGambit: 10x more toxic
[2:44:12] Arocian: ppl would troll the f out of that
[2:44:17] paulson14: just do what OW does

[2:44:26] paulson14: ends the match if someone leaves right away
[2:44:28] Sandisy: no way score can get lowered in m+ que. the toxicity would get out of control real fast

[2:45:34] SnerPnNerF: So you don’t have the flexibility to pick up a brez or lust in this new proposed solo queue?
[2:45:52] miikex2: there is no way a queue system like this would work lol
[2:45:54] Heero_Effect: Would rather make my own group or sign up for groups
[2:46:01] ripperofbong420: i play alot of overwatch in high rank and dont trust blizz group metrics. i get players that are too low of rank all the time in my games
[2:46:40] Heero_Effect: @snerpnnerf lol right? It would need to be smart enough

[2:48:51] Inthezonewow: BDK best DK
[2:49:08] srslywtfdude: commited
[2:49:08] Sarocus: Bro DK
[2:49:11] brazkat: yeah but there would be a leave penalty just like solo shuffle
[2:49:14] gooni_coyg: Sometimes people forgets that you can always do your own key.
[2:49:31] LUKA_THIM: @Heero_Effect i wish i had that much money
[2:49:32] hwired: What if queue times for dps are like 30 mins
[2:49:43] Arocian: that would be fine
[2:49:50] asmodai4823: @hwired so?
[2:49:56] igamingpublic: @Gooners what?
[2:50:09] ripperofbong420: i just hate the idea that meta is necessary for a 20. like its hard but all classes seem viable
[2:50:17] Masqerader: ya i don't wanna solo random queue into a mythic + dungeon that has no lust or bres
[2:50:19] hwired: I don't care, just saying if you "just leave the group" would be stupid for dps
[2:50:44] havoom01: help me stepbrother im stuck
[2:51:04] ripperofbong420: blood dk can cc out the ass
[2:51:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK has kicks

[2:51:38] ripperofbong420: they have so much cc that every mage in pvp constantly is raging about it
[2:51:39] asmodai4823: yea ofc
[2:51:39] SlideCancelXDD: meta isnt necessary for 20s, but the pugging experience has been so bad for a lot of people that our requirements are higher for randoms
[2:51:50] reggiepowa: I think it would be a separate system like with solo shuffle
[2:51:56] miikex2: diff for mid to high keys
[2:52:10] Arocian: I would solo
[2:52:14] sliproach: problems not the game, it's teh player all classes are playable but somee people ssay x or y is bad so it can't eb selected by anyoen bs
[2:52:15] Sandisy: they guy just declined from group 87 in a row would probably que up. they exist
[2:52:18] rbolude: I'd rather q
[2:52:20] raldrik: I would queue. Getting declined for an hour and wasting my night is not fun
[2:52:22] Phayntt: just wait till moonkins arnt good in keys and i bet tettles changes his mind when hes getting spam delcined again xD
[2:52:25] Heero_Effect: Maybe 2-10 mythic plus I’d queue, but 15s I’m making my win group
[2:52:29] ripperofbong420: i play alot of overwatch so wow group is kind of refreshing. at least youre fucking yourself and not some algorithm
[2:52:30] mejiro151: would you have seperate ratings for your DPS spec and Tank/Heal Spec?  If you tank to 2400, doesnt mean you can DPS at 2400 level
[2:52:35] aRustyRanger: That would be really cool because you could build up your key that way and take it into your own group after

[2:52:38] Arocian: cap it yep
[2:52:38] Gelendrill: For low to mid groups, I would queue.  Sometimes I don't have the time to try to assemble a group, or spend an hour trying to apply.
[2:52:48] CardinalTX: why limit it?   if a pug can do it they do it if not they dont
[2:52:48] reggiepowa: I would probably just do premade keys, solo keys would be a bad idea for anything above +10
[2:52:50] abracka_: not a fan of the idea for MMR on it either. someone can just pay for some m+ boosts, have a high mmr with low ilvl. then you would have someone 375 ilvl in a +13-15
[2:53:07] Romnus: I'm pretty casual and would love a queue system. Mainly because I play very solo and don't know play with friends. I've looked for keys for 30 mins+ before
[2:53:11] Kstrad: Would only so solo shuffle only if organized groups didn't exist. because that would then kill pug m+
[2:53:19] raldrik: I think they need to a score system that adjust dungeon difficulty
[2:53:24] AlphasaurusRexx: itd probably be key range on specific key
[2:53:38] SundanceC: I am distracted by how much he messes with his hair
[2:53:42] Heero_Effect: towSip
[2:54:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: queue times ewwwww
[2:54:11] asmodai4823: just push your own key 4Head
[2:54:11] ripperofbong420: im still stuck on dks not having kicks. video lost me. but the rest of what he says is right
[2:54:19] rbolude: nah, it takes forever to get accepted unless you are 400+ ilvl applying for a 7 lol
[2:54:19] paulson14: the 3%
[2:54:20] reggiepowa: as a 2.8k player I can pretty much always get into keys from people who are 2.6k or lower even as a non meta class

[2:54:44] Griffo525: Griffo525 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:54:47] 2naDlisch: But will tanks and healers solo shuffle, or would it be full of dps
[2:54:53] AlphasaurusRexx: nah theres plenty of people queueing for it. Nobody is healing solo shuffle because its 90% toxic healing environment
[2:54:57] Arocian: pvp solo has ilvl cap now
[2:54:59] miikex2: full of dps
[2:55:02] Aquadriel: , so queues would be there
[2:55:03] Thoreya: how will que times be ridiculous
[2:55:04] AlphasaurusRexx: which is why the queues are long
[2:55:07] Gelendrill: If I am applying to groups, I have to run lower keys than I should just to be accepted faster.
[2:55:08] Thoreya: theres literally floods of group in lfg rn
[2:55:09] miikex2: tanks/heals can already get into lfg groups
[2:55:26] Thoreya: pvp is different, healers are not as popular in arena
[2:55:28] Phayntt: brick the key in the first pull. spend another 45 min looking for another
[2:56:10] Thoreya: yes thats the main issue for solo que m+. rating going down as opposed to never going down like rn
[2:56:27] Thoreya: m+ers are gonna rage if someone borked their key and theiir rating goes down
[2:56:46] Phayntt: to be fair if M+ score can go down, people would probably be more inclined to play better/not leave
[2:57:28] Arocian: lfg grps are scuffed also though

[2:58:29] reggiepowa: @AlphasaurusRexx I think they already realized when Blizzard upped max m+ rewards to +20 this expansion, it's no longer do a weekly brainless 15 and you are done
[2:58:40] AlphasaurusRexx: itd be interesting for them to test it out though like they did solo shuffle. if it doeesnt hit, then they can say told you so
[2:58:42] captain_khyzan: M+ is fine and soloq is fine....
[2:58:48] Heero_Effect: What is that coffee table behind him !? towPog
[2:58:50] miikex2: nobody would want to risk not completing a key and having their rating go down compared to lfg
[2:58:54] reggiepowa: yeah agreed
[2:59:06] FutileDiploma: @towelliee damn I’m hooked to Diablo 3 now after seeing you play it
[2:59:11] ripperofbong420: #giveblooddkmorecc
[2:59:13] Alepouditsa: the just need to remove the io
[2:59:16] Phayntt: You'd have to have solo shuffle M+ score seperate from regular iO
[2:59:41] captain_khyzan: some dungeons require certain comp for heals / tank for cleanse and stuff to. just wouldnt work
[2:59:53] AlphasaurusRexx: @AlphasaurusRexx nah, i personally have no interest in doing 20s since the reward cap for io is 2500 whereas you had to do 15s before. When people get hard stuck +10s because their mmr, itll be a kick in the nuts for a lot of people since they arent getting carried anymore
[2:59:55] rbolude: you could make it so solo q doesn't affect score. like the "unranked" version of m+
[3:00:02] belliam99: They need solo shuffle RBG.
[3:00:06] Arocian: why lower pts in one and not the other
[3:00:17] Cheniac: That’s the story with any mmr based ranked game though, you always lose points due to other people.
[3:00:29] haveachub: Hey Towelliee what addon is that. thats showing you the group comp in LFG?
[3:00:42] phattboi_80: PvP solo shuffle MMR on the top end is either equal to or higher than MMR on the actual 3s ladder
[3:01:00] CeruleanStar: the people whining are the ones who don't know how to rise in the current system
[3:01:00] Alepouditsa: maby the need to make the mythics change like you don't lose the key of you fail
[3:01:17] Darkome974: my mate for m+ didnt understand why im in vacation this week XD one off them rerrol and he says he will never complain again XD
[3:01:17] ripperofbong420: yea i mean queue times can be super fucked. specially if you are good and grind rank, youre waiting hours for another 3k andy
[3:01:19] PyromooseTV: can you imaGINE the trolls youd find, 100x more than now 10k healing disc priests all day
[3:01:21] sliproach: @belliam99 too right been unplayable since wod/start of legion
[3:01:33] Arocian: put in action and if it doesn't play out then it doesn't play out
[3:01:35] CeruleanStar: here's a fact: tanking is easy, fun, and get invited well below gear lvls for m+'s lol
[3:01:38] belliam99: If you can’t get into a group. Run your own key…
[3:01:48] reggiepowa: it wasnt more played then season 1 for sure
[3:02:00] Romnus: I will always advocate for vendor systems.
[3:02:08] PyromooseTV: they need to drop more gear based on if you time or not
[3:02:37] mejiro151: not to mention, there is NO plate belt in M+ dungeons at all
[3:02:37] Cheniac: There defs should be some sort of cool xmog or whatever that you could work towards with rating.
[3:02:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: running mythic + all day and not getting what you are farming for is terrible
[3:02:41] AlphasaurusRexx: @CeruleanStar same with healers. someone doing 15k dps lower than the others is very noticable difference in key length though.
[3:02:44] Heero_Effect: There needs a bad luck protection. It’s not fun to grind same dungeon for your BIS gear
[3:02:47] tehrobtar: agreed... only time i've ever gotten a gigaupgrade like that is when it's a newer 70 that i'm still gearing rofl
[3:02:50] abracka_: i've done 6 m+ runs and gotten nothing but primal chaos and the primal focus or w/e
[3:02:51] Draz3nx: the vault is only good loot you can get
[3:03:05] rosina_scarlett: I hate hard carrying groups and not getting stuff on my rogue
[3:03:06] gooni_coyg: tbh we do m+ for the weekly vault. thats it
[3:03:11] Sollice: Thats why BFA titasn dust or whatever it was was amazing
[3:03:20] Alepouditsa: @PyromooseTV if the do that the rejection will be even more, base on that the will be looking for biger ilvl so ansure the will do it
[3:03:23] Sollice: Where you could get targeted gear at specific item levels
[3:03:24] raldrik: yeah it sucks running a dungeon just to qualify for a lootbox roll for the vault because the vault is higher ilvl then the dungeon.
[3:03:28] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWELFEB149 for just $1.49 per meal at https://strms.net/everyplate_towelliee
[3:03:28] tehrobtar: i liked the bonus roll system that pandaria had... you could grind the charms and upgrade them to the elder charms so that you could use them for bonus loot rolls
[3:03:30] RaginCajun05: y not have more pieces drop from end of dungeon
[3:03:33] tehrobtar: i wish we had something like that again
[3:03:36] Zucchey: @Towelliee Vault sucks so bad sometimes, i had 4necks out of 6 slots one time with 418 lariat on me
[3:03:43] toocheap2rhyme: click bait
[3:03:46] captain_khyzan: chest needs to go back to 3 pieces of loot
[3:04:01] Exodeo_: all my gear is from hc raiding and the vault lol
[3:04:07] love_eggplant: trading post weekly outfit is amazing
[3:04:08] LUKA_THIM: tmog set is amazing from post
[3:04:09] love_eggplant: did ya see it?
[3:04:13] love_eggplant: i mean monthly
[3:04:13] LovingR: what does trading post have
[3:04:17] biirrd: open in EU
[3:04:17] Exodeo_: You don't want the trading post to open, it's broken on EU xD
[3:04:19] biirrd: =)
[3:04:20] Heero_Effect: They doing drops again?
[3:04:20] AlphasaurusRexx: type " 19-20" after the  mythic keystone in the search
[3:04:21] gooni_coyg: Trading post not open on NA? woot
[3:04:23] j_bar111: Its also a crap week
[3:04:29] toocheap2rhyme: thats why i hate the whole arguement about run your own key
[3:04:31] K0rzak0v: just give it a go
[3:04:33] asmodai4823: ppl dont join 19s because you could just join a 20 instead
[3:04:35] captain_khyzan: this week is ruff...
[3:04:36] K0rzak0v: help him out :p
[3:04:36] Thadune: @towelliee the best part of vendor is not having to grind the same M+ over and over. I think I'm about to hit 20+ runs on my hunter alt to try and get a weapon upgrade from Jade. Running the same dungeon gets boring and burns you quickly.
[3:04:38] pk99: +19 "bonus valor" Kappa
[3:04:42] Pr0fan1ty: i put up keys solo all the time early on all my buddys play at night
[3:04:44] comp1: that an he 2/8 normal too
[3:04:44] jarilrpg: they need a system similar to pvp gearing, where there are two currencies, one that is capped that lets you buy gear, and a second one that isnt capped that lets you upgrade based on your m+ score
[3:04:51] cmitchell042092: Or they’re in a dead guild and this is their only option
[3:04:58] MixelPlx: glad to see wow getting drops finally
[3:05:50] aRustyRanger: shadowlands pvp had mitch jones
[3:05:52] raldrik: I wonder if they will do a creator boost 2 gifted = pet or tmog for D4 launch

[4:23:27] ewokfuzzybutts: the "grind" in destiny is just leveling guns
[4:23:29] j_bar111: @ewokfuzzybutts maybe it was a ghost monkaS
[4:23:48] Evenuno: BDO is a pretty rough grind

[4:24:00] wulfzor: @phocho i stopped playing when i had to hone my gear for 0.1% chance to upgrade
[4:24:17] AlphasaurusRexx: literally dont need to grind in D2 tocomplete the raids. the actual grind comes from trying to obtain god roles on weapons
[4:24:56] Boggogroggo: yes
[4:24:56] ewokfuzzybutts: god rolls are good rolls
[4:24:57] RockemSockem0821: stupid stats
[4:25:02] Lobby_WoW: d2 has rng on stats for weps but it also has crafting for weps now too
[4:25:05] ewokfuzzybutts: and you can target farm them
[4:25:06] Lobby_WoW: to help get perfect stats
[4:25:11] Exodeo_: so like titanforging?
[4:25:31] Mecabeast: So God rolls means certain perks for a build but you also have weapon ilvl you have to infuse to increase
[4:25:38] JFeezy__: D4 will be the first diablo game i ever played. Hopefully its a good one.
[4:25:42] AlphasaurusRexx: each weapon has a set of perks with only 3 available on any give roll of the gun. the god rolled weapons are the ones with the best perks and stats that you can get per weapon
[4:25:44] Ky5umu: you doing 25 raid bosses for TP?
[4:25:54] ewokfuzzybutts: @AlphasaurusRexx not true, you do need to hit a power cap or you're going to be a detriment to your party
[4:26:02] Evenuno: BDO is definitely meant for masochists
[4:26:20] Boggogroggo: BDO is a lot of fun as long as you stay away from all the crafting and just play the game like an arpg
[4:26:39] AlphasaurusRexx: @AlphasaurusRexx well yeah you cant run in there with blueberry light levels. but you dont need to put your face to the grindstone to hit the soft cap
[4:26:57] Heero_Effect: @jfeezy__ play d2 and d3 rheybcheap now
[4:27:02] Ky5umu: Terrace is a quick 4 bosses and you can que for lfr over and over
[4:27:54] Evenuno: ToS?
[4:28:01] KaptnG: Raid from wrath only bosses
[4:28:06] beerking2323: is that deliivery or Digornio?
[4:28:31] beerking2323: im jk :)
[4:28:36] ewokfuzzybutts: @AlphasaurusRexx nah you don't have to no life it but especially at a new expansion the power cap isn't just done immediately. Thankfully in season 21 or 22 they're getting rid of the need to hit power cap each season
[4:29:04] DeansPlay: Whats bdo
[4:29:04] Thoreya: noawh respoded to ur prot pal tweet
[4:29:30] Evenuno: @deansplay Black Desert Online
[4:29:46] AlphasaurusRexx: @AlphasaurusRexx theres a ton to grind out though between god rolls and season pass and titles if thats what people are interested in. Are they scaling difficulty or something?
[4:29:50] DeansPlay: ah thanks
[4:30:33] ewokfuzzybutts: @AlphasaurusRexx everything is now scaled even vanguard ops, so no more steamrolling
[4:30:40] JFeezy__: Yeah, but Naowh is an elitist min maxxer so he prolly meant more or less learning to be top 1 percent prot player lol
[4:31:00] fluh_: cheese is new formed group with fraggy on it
[4:31:00] LuiBMHunter: fairly good just to get there surely?
[4:31:07] comp1: Monka
[4:31:21] Mecabeast: Heard ret lost blessed hammer with the newest ptr build
[4:31:21] Thoreya: gingi was saying this is prob the best weekend for mdi

[4:34:10] flebbooo: they just built different
[4:34:22] dokor: they were always just better, but this time it really does feel like they're on a completely different lvl than the rest
[4:34:34] rockytcp: Liquid is in MDI?

[4:35:22] fluh_: drenaco
[4:35:33] Heero_Effect: I don’t get how liquid makes money outside of raid tier
[4:36:01] Quikbeard: Do you not understand how sponsors work? Lol
[4:36:07] Evenuno: @heero_effect I mean Liquid is a massive esports team
[4:36:22] podjkins_: They sponsored by Honda ffs

[4:40:11] captain_khyzan: id rather less corporate style teams... more back to the roots of being a gamer then "companies" running the scene where 100k+ is spent
[4:40:56] wulfzor: @captain_khyzan well now those gamers are actually making money while gaming thanks to companies
[4:40:56] biirrd: becouse they have the best talent on the show.
[4:41:11] Evenuno: @captain_khyzan without income a lot of the wow esports guys would struggle unless they are a solid streamer too

[4:44:49] captain_khyzan: nah i get why it works, just makes it less fun to watch when u see stuff like liquid spent over 100k on splits gearing and boe... i dont mind sponsors and what not just the degen side that is possible with that money. makes it less relatable to watch, again just my opinion

[5:58:25] TialePetit: No.. the blue one will split in to mini's
[5:58:54] CeruleanStar: yeah always clear the last floor on a neph rift to check for gobo
[5:59:00] EthicalHermit: There is a "Bandit" Shrine too, spawns goblins. Not sure if it can spawn Rainbow Gob though.
[5:59:35] mozavich: @CeruleanStar pretty sure rifts keep going and going

[6:00:29] tuggyxl: good thing we can craft primals now
[6:00:39] Lloydbanksz: U can make ur own primal by deleting 2
[6:00:47] EthicalHermit: You can craft and wear one this season, have to sac 2 primals to get the materials though.
[6:00:54] mozavich: @CeruleanStar oh i see
[6:00:55] tuggyxl: last recipe in cube
[6:01:02] futomara01: reroll
[6:01:06] Bullypoppin: You need to DE 2 primal and it's limited to 1 equip

[6:13:56] Ginobliii: Guys if I haven't played d3 since a few months after ROS generally, is it worth it to play?  Have no real paragon levels built up like 150 on hardcore
[6:14:12] Day_Walker78: to get a primal is about 1/400 legendarys but some times you can get them way more often then that if you are lucky
[6:14:13] 91Niki: @Ginobliii If you play season you start over
[6:14:49] enfuze_: @Day_Walker78 by that logic sometimes it can take much more than 1/400 then
[6:15:51] 91Niki: Gonna have all the bounties done by the time Towelliee gets back LUL
[6:15:52] Molvonos: Like Niki says, Season starts you fresh every time anyways

[6:19:50] bioreducto: you need staff of herding for alter
[6:19:51] MaximumSerg: cow level no?
[6:20:08] DunzoCD: you get double primal drops once you complete it
[6:20:41] tuggyxl: opens up whimsydale aswell, not that it matters anymore
[6:20:59] Day_Walker78: no still the same drop rate
[6:20:59] srtteddy: no same chance, but when one drops, it now drops 2
[6:21:02] DunzoCD: no its when you get one you get a second
[6:21:02] alantin77: no when a Primal drops 2 drop instead of 1
[6:21:07] dokor: no, when you get a primal, you get a second one
[6:21:16] Day_Walker78: just that it will drope 2 insted of 1
[6:21:24] Nokterian: Staff of Herding is the thoughest one to get for the altar
[6:21:26] Nokterian: yes
[6:21:31] Nokterian: it is for the altar
[6:22:33] Outerlaw: Gg

[6:34:10] Hebrewish012: that's annoying
[6:34:36] DxxCutter: @kostchie Cube exists in both seasonal and non-seasonal
[6:35:17] kostchie: How do you pick up the quest if you are already 70 in non-seasonal content?

[6:35:51] Vipervenom2u: There is no quest just a place to run @kostchie I forget the name though
[6:35:52] DennisTried: good evening, towel and towel enjoyers. how do you do?=
[6:35:53] Maydie6066: expansions/DLC cost money

[6:35:58] zeiours: A console or pc Kappa
[6:36:02] DunzoCD: do you still have to buy old expacs to unlock certain content?

[6:37:18] Maydie6066: so the Latest expac is Lightfall, 2nd to latest is Beyond Light (in WoW terms, you get SL for free atm, since DF is the new Expac)
[6:37:29] Hambubger86: @Towelliee it's "free to play" in the sense that you can play a lot of the game, but if you want all the exotics and such you need to buy expansions
[6:37:55] Nokterian: it was confirmed that goblins will be in D4
[6:37:56] Klant467: bad
[6:38:06] EthicalHermit: It gets salvaged

[6:40:04] WytChapp: I have all of them bc I keep buying them to not play the game

[7:16:33] ActasTV: and convert yellow ones
[7:16:35] ActasTV: at cube
[7:16:35] tuggyxl: i just do rifts of grifts, or upgrade yellow rings
[7:16:39] ActasTV: chance too
[7:17:05] deeyeazy: 50 shards per, and the chances are bad to get one, so many legendary rings in game better to just spam rifts GR 90 gives most loot
[7:17:25] wildheittv: It is a fair chance. I've done 2 this season
[7:17:31] wildheittv: after about 50 upgrades
[7:17:33] alantin77: it can happen but you might also have to Reforge it into Ancient version
[7:17:56] ActasTV: depends  of the luck.  if u have alot mats,  upgrade yellow ones
[7:18:11] deeyeazy: huge waste when you will 100% need them for later things
