[0:46:20] Nulgar: ugh, moved the pagefile off C: onto D: since WoW is even bigger after the patch, and my SSD is too small, but I'm already noticing Windows performing worse, since the pagefile is now on an HDD...
[0:46:35] Rico_Azzarash: Sorry I ruined 69 for now xDDD
[0:46:46] funviking99: KomodoHype
[0:47:06] KatziCael: @Nulgar ohnoooo! SSDs are cheap right now just fyi
[0:47:14] Elrathir: *gasp* a weinus
[0:47:28] Fernite95: We could have used that professor tali emote before when you were telling us about the flying flick trick
[0:47:50] ebrahim_91: Talk to Alexstrassza do this quest then talk to Vyranoth then go to Emerald Dream then do Gilneas is best way to play this imo
[0:47:54] backtrakk2121: a few cinematics, so a single screen for those is nice
[0:48:00] TankenFunk: I prefer dual screen
[0:48:01] GameingAspect: two is good one for cutscene
[0:48:02] Zirconix: pip
[0:48:10] ebrahim_91: oh u mean screen ahaha
[0:48:10] Nulgar: @KatziCael yeah need to get a bigger one, but I'd better pull the PC out from under the desk and decide how to best include a new drive...
[0:48:14] Aimewow: I kind of like split screen
[0:48:15] Ruffsia: Single screen for quest
[0:48:16] boubotte: single screen coz cutscenes tbh
[0:48:23] revan4686: there r two stay and chat up there to @taliesinandevitel
[0:48:24] MrBrightside1: single for cutscenes
[0:48:24] atamala: 2 screens = double the dopamine
[0:48:24] seanstrachan: Probably single for most of the content until gilneas stuff
[0:48:30] Fernite95: Split
[0:48:33] Rico_Azzarash: I am happy with whatever as long as I can see you both :3
[0:48:35] Promilie: Split
[0:48:38] TipsyDragon: Maybe single screen on dialogues/voiceovers
[0:48:43] backtrakk2121: quest split, cinematic single
[0:48:45] backtrakk2121: imo
[0:48:53] KatziCael: @Nulgar SATA SSDs are cheap/easy to add :)
[0:49:01] crazidaizi: going for a pre night shift sleep, have a great stream and day guys!
[0:49:13] KatziCael: Ebyssian's new model is soooo good
[0:49:17] Mewt_75: Immersion addon so great
[0:49:30] Promilie: fantastic Alexstrasza impression
[0:49:50] FelPlague: felplaDancey CINEMATIC TIME LEZHGOOOOOOOOOO felplaDancey
[0:50:01] backtrakk2121: i want those fire horns on my evoker
[0:50:10] backtrakk2121: the lava horns
[0:50:51] seanstrachan: Vyranoth dragon form has always looked a bit low rez tbh :/
[0:50:53] FelPlague: it was really weird she was the one of the incarnates to not get a rather unique model, hers is the same as the other ice dragons with only a slight difference
[0:51:04] Karvenboom: Why don't you get the title 😭
[0:51:06] FelPlague: Was really hoping for her to have a more unique appearence
[0:51:07] backtrakk2121: i looked on my character titles, i didnt see Champion of the Dragonflights, much sad to be had
[0:51:14] GameingAspect: hopefully you got a screen shot of tht
[0:51:15] KatziCael: @Karvenboom Right?! It's sad there is no title
[0:51:16] Rico_Azzarash: No
[0:51:19] Rico_Azzarash: No title for you :3
[0:51:32] Elrathir: Cheer100 Evitel, I must know, which hunter tier mog did you vote for?
[0:51:45] Noznatation: Great - what does it give? Discount at starbucks?
[0:51:51] VimFuego1970: just want to boop Merithra‘s nose
[0:52:01] FelPlague: Yeah, her appearence is only SLIGHTLY different then the other ice dragons, fryaak's being the addition of the flame horns, while razageth and iridikron were VERY different models.
[0:52:16] backtrakk2121: the ice chicken hunter set
[0:52:22] backtrakk2121: season 1
[0:52:50] WTFHali: i love her logic lol
[0:53:11] DiscordianKitty: my theory is that a lot of hunters voted 1 because they didn't have a good option so just chose the first one
[0:53:20] Noznatation: Oh - This is some american voting logic right? This explain so much about their elections :D
[0:53:23] backtrakk2121: season 2 did win for priests
[0:53:40] netonkent: While your in the isles you might as well check out the tree stuff 😝💙
[0:53:41] zeckzeckzeck: The problem is that people think the S3 for a lot of classes is good when it's actuall the class reworks that did it
[0:53:47] zeckzeckzeck: Hunters are one of those, for ex
[0:53:50] backtrakk2121: pally and warrior got season 2 appearance as well
[0:53:59] FelPlague: The vote was a mess, blizz really needs to just cave and add all of them and let us choose, cause some classes got hard screwed
[0:54:04] funviking99: LUL LUL LUL
[0:54:06] DiscordianKitty: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[0:54:08] Elrathir: I voted hunter season 2, I love that chest piece and I would have loved another chance at the elite version. Alas!
[0:54:14] Mazerbeam: Hunters should have voted 2, but we are morons
[0:54:21] backtrakk2121: 2 is multi shot, most hunters use it for an opener
[0:54:24] ebrahim_91: I voted season 1 the same reason you voted season 1 Evitel ! Cause I am missing  alot of pieces
[0:54:33] Orminbelf: Orminbelf subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:54:37] siber_duck: I'm so mad that S2 holy paladin tier set won, S3 is so much better imo rooMadSlam
[0:54:38] Nulgar: people probably also think they won't have to break their S3 bonus - but I believe it's gonna be a technically different, but not stacking bonus, so there's gonna be a perioud when you have 2S3 and 2S4, but won't get both boni.
[0:54:45] netonkent: 3 buttons not in this economy ,haha
[0:54:56] backtrakk2121: @siber_duck i dont need any of the season 2 appearances, so for me its a waste
[0:55:19] harimari: needs to be even slower to match alex´s cadence
[0:55:19] KatziCael: I didn't have Any of these quests when I was on today >.<
[0:55:31] funviking99: KomodoHype
[0:55:32] Gideon2826: The tiny arms

[0:55:58] Nulgar: looks rather concerned... or shy miaowShy
[0:56:39] FelPlague: Me and Hiru are 100% on iridikron best modern wow villian sincel ike lich king
[0:56:45] Gideon2826: Where is site for voting?
[0:56:56] siber_duck: @siber_duck I meant the bonus, but tier set ain't it as well
[0:56:57] backtrakk2121: Irid knows how to make an opening
[0:57:04] backtrakk2121: or an entrance

[0:58:32] Bears_Adventures: Soooo cool!!!!
[0:58:44] FelPlague: Iridikron a man of honour, I love him. Even though she is his enemy, she is still his sister, sparing her unless she gets between him and his goal.
[0:58:47] backtrakk2121: i guess he was sleeping on the mountain when it snowed
[0:58:48] funviking99: that was cool
[0:58:56] Lefleksik: Iri 10/10, Viryn like 7/10

[1:02:54] FelPlague: I think we may see him but only small catches of him, like we may encounter him gathering something he needs, and fight him ony, for him to leave us behind
[1:02:54] Bears_Adventures: bearsa9Love bearsa9Love bearsa9Love
[1:03:00] Lefleksik: maybe .5 patch with him?
[1:03:01] TankenFunk: But the return of Iridikron will be so cool tho
[1:03:01] backtrakk2121: Dagger Wifu is gonna step in for him, i consider it an upgrade

[1:04:14] backtrakk2121: *shadowlands cinematic
[1:04:17] Fernite95: Surely we will be sniffing arpund trying to figure out where he is and what hes up to

[1:07:48] backtrakk2121: if Irid takes the Heart from Mists, maybe Garrosh doesnt go all old gods and gets a redemption arc?  since we all know Garrosh did Nothing Wrong
[1:07:59] rei__03: interesting
[1:08:01] DiscordianKitty: i assumed dark heart referred to the dark heart of azeroth that xalatath is using, and started seriously doubting myself when I saw everyone else saying it's almost certainly the heart of y'shaarj.
[1:08:03] atamala: maybe some lorewalker cho stuff
[1:08:09] seanstrachan: I doubt it tbh
[1:08:14] GameingAspect: i am not convinced
[1:08:33] cardrenn: I think zala will use the artifact on the heart of azeroth
[1:08:54] misterstimpak: Hasn't Tali been calling for the rebirth of Galakrond since the launch of Dragonflight?
[1:09:10] DiscordianKitty: i like the theory that she's collecting old gods and will go for that heart
[1:09:32] backtrakk2121: @DiscordianKitty collecting C'thun is gonna be tricky then
[1:09:41] chico_escuela: SOD

[1:11:45] GameingAspect: oh dammmmmmmm
[1:11:55] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel I do have some worry, the hearthstone aniversary stuff got added this patch, but that wont be till march, which implies 10.2.6 and season 4 wont be till late march atleast
[1:12:09] Fernite95: Do we know what 10.26 is about?
[1:12:15] GameingAspect: azarite > saranite tht theory is very linked
[1:12:24] backtrakk2121: i just hope the head item i kept from BFA becomes useful before this Saga is over
[1:12:30] Thromash: @TaliesinAndEvitel slightly off topic but do you think the void corrupted world soul Sargeras killed went to the Void like Argus went to the Shadowlands? Or still went to the Order afterlife? I can't stop thinking about it.
[1:12:46] Nulgar: @FelPlague could also just mean the stuff is ready to be implemented
[1:12:50] atamala: even if stuff is added in this patch, that doesn't mean it won't be activated until after the next patch
[1:12:52] backtrakk2121: my DH didnt sell out everyone just for a headband with an eyeball on it

[1:16:45] grimblymcgoo: Did all the druids notice the portal in the emerald dreamway? The unmarked one goes to the new city @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:16:58] FelPlague: Was kinda hoping for some cool dracthyr thing this patch, either expansion of mog or expansion of classes they can play but eh, hopefully that comes before war within

[1:25:48] misterstimpak: Congratulations Shandris, you're getting a younger sibling.
[1:25:50] netonkent: I expected the the "we will not abandon our old lands but not the teldresil line" i am so happy
[1:25:50] KaydenGrey: i did appreciate the confirmation that they havent abandoned kalimdor, and that they will return to teldrassil some day
[1:25:51] the_howlermonkey: Player housing in all the rebuilt zones incoming
[1:25:58] backtrakk2121: @FelPlague true enough, but it was annoying...to be fair

[1:26:56] KaydenGrey: no freaking WAY they would put horde player houses in bel'ameth
[1:27:25] KaydenGrey: w
[1:27:28] backtrakk2121: the housing can be in the plains, lots of open land there (close to a city) and either faction can use it
[1:27:31] Dman3171: we burn it again
[1:27:40] backtrakk2121: back in WoD they pitched zone garrisons, why not zone houses?

[1:41:17] seanstrachan: Did Tali just say sunwell NotLikeThis
[1:41:24] backtrakk2121: honestly if they dropped Player Housing right after the World Soul Saga it would be a HUGE way to bring people in for the new storyline
[1:41:25] hyugaftw: LOVING the duel-cams!
[1:42:04] havvorthia: Evi needs to find the bow before y'all go!
[1:42:08] halsey101: tneOhno
[1:42:23] seanstrachan: That's all old Cata stuff anyway Evi
[1:42:28] backtrakk2121: @havvorthia i hope its not still bugged, i went right to it and nothing was lootable
[1:42:29] PinkSharkie: its at the lodge i think
[1:42:59] Hippwn: Yesterday the bow could only be looted by hunters but its at the lodge on the far north of the map
[1:43:15] HSAyril: Good morning!
[1:43:18] havvorthia: Top Left on the map, at the lodge. I looted it a half an hour ago as a priest so I think it's good now :)
[1:43:55] JMan31337: wonder if the dynamic flight is going to become a problem with worlds scale so no one ever just walks anywhere and is always on a mount
[1:44:24] grimblymcgoo: @JMan31337 i think their data probably shows theres not a huge population flying over old stuff
[1:44:36] backtrakk2121: spyglass is a fun one
[1:44:52] Nulgar: @JMan31337 welcome to Cataclysm
[1:45:02] TankenFunk: @TaliesinAndEvitel Looking at the "starter gear" transmog you can find around here, the zone layout and Amirdrassil in general, I'm convince Nelves (and possibly more) will be able to do a lvl 1-10 starting experience here instead of Exile's Reach before venturing into the rest of the Dragon Isles
[1:45:21] TankenFunk: Or maybe it's just wishful thinking tneEvi
[1:45:28] Promilie: Now give dracthyr classic flying! I need it for RP
[1:46:24] MrAndersen_: bit late in the marriage to be asking those kind of questions no
[1:46:34] backtrakk2121: its a lot less crowded then Darnass was, feels more open
[1:46:43] JMan31337: was thinking more along the lines of the world and items in it becoming oddly large to the character size I felt like dragon flight had a lot of empty area kind of like a you move faster things need to be farther apart now
[1:48:16] astralumi: @TankenFunk i was thinking the same! exploring the zone yesterday, it really feels like a starting area! and an amazing one
[1:48:37] funviking99: tneTaliSelch
[1:49:10] boubotte: i like the idea of the world being so much larger than our character and having stuff scattered
[1:49:21] Viuffx: Volduun still needed 10x more negative space imo
[1:49:53] Dinshara: hello guys
[1:50:00] Fernite95: Very crammed in together
[1:50:09] boubotte: it makes the game more breathable, less overwhelming
[1:50:22] HatchlingMiquela: the negative space in shadowlands was the flight between oribos and the zones
[1:50:25] MrBrightside1: Flying around highmountain will be fun
[1:50:50] JMan31337: I miss all the easter eggs and things they used to fill the world with in classic that you had to search out. there used to be a really nice podcast called WoW less traveled that covered a lot of them
[1:50:57] astralumi: i think so
[1:50:58] grimblymcgoo: Yep
[1:51:03] Ob1dragonborn: you can use it everywhere
[1:51:03] befek: I ccouldnt use it antorus zones
[1:51:06] astralumi: they said "everywhere you can fly"
[1:51:11] grimblymcgoo: Dynamic everywhere. You can also mount dragonriding mounts where only ground are available
[1:51:11] dergNwolf: they would feel SO tiny
[1:51:21] MichaelXIII: If it's not bugged
[1:51:34] Sadbe: one day we can fly in ghostlands as well
[1:51:41] Hippwn: Is the stay awhile and listen at Kalecgos new or was that there before
[1:51:57] astralumi: @Sadbe hopefully on Midnight! :D
[1:52:33] Fernite95: Hopefully when we go back to quel thelas they will update those burning crusade zones for flying
[1:52:47] VimFuego1970: you could have used portal in new place
[1:52:47] Gh0stBadger: i did that same thing, went up toplooking
[1:52:47] Hippwn: Genn has a stay awhile and liten too
[1:52:52] Hippwn: right there

[1:54:48] boubotte: omg they're talking bout Anduin??
[1:54:53] funviking99: tes
[1:54:54] Nulgar: should've used the "Cozy Bonfire" toy
[1:54:54] Rico_Azzarash: TALI use Bowl of Glowing Pufferfish!
[1:54:55] funviking99: yea
[1:54:58] holyzeke: back in my day you needed wood and flint for fire
[1:55:11] girlfrmmars: oooh, who's the voiceacter for Genn?
[1:55:17] girlfrmmars: Sounds familiar
[1:55:33] Nulgar: Not sure I've ever heard Genn speaks this softly before.
[1:55:36] astralumi: Turalyon has been such a good boi. i hope he stays that way
[1:55:41] girlfrmmars: Yeah, sounds different
[1:55:44] TankenFunk: Cameron Folmar
[1:55:46] RosieSeren: its supposedly the same voice actor, but a much different tone
[1:55:48] Rico_Azzarash: Tali, try Bowl of Glowing Pufferfish.  If you use fishes from it you will be emitting light!!!
[1:55:54] boubotte: i think the voice actor of genn is doing an awesome job at making him sound more... tired? old?
[1:55:58] funviking99: he was always angry LUL
[1:56:05] girlfrmmars: Cameron Folmar
[1:56:07] Fernite95: And now Genn is getting his kingdom back which is going to change the eastern kingdom politics isnt it?
[1:56:09] girlfrmmars: Never heard of him.
[1:56:09] Ob1dragonborn: it feels so good
[1:56:21] girlfrmmars: But yeah, he's been voicing him since 2010
[1:56:42] siber_duck: 8k? rooD
[1:56:58] Nulgar: Alliance getting more and more Horde mounts, and we're still not getting the Bee...
[1:57:19] Gh0stBadger: dang she has almost 9k tendor lol
[1:57:24] Fernite95: No bee.... feelsbad

[1:57:53] Karvenboom: New allied race xD
[1:58:04] Karvenboom: Or class skins
[1:58:06] astralumi: @Bakjepluh that's only in the next xpac :) only draongs for now

[2:02:46] seanstrachan: I like how she keeps saying "it's just Calia now" then brings up that she's a Menethil at every opportunity 😂
[2:02:47] laineymacc: Love Calia.
[2:02:52] Karvenboom: As a forsaken I was /laughing all the way while doing the quests. Also cannibalizing on cooldown

[2:06:18] BoezIRL: reed the letter
[2:06:43] grimblymcgoo: @emi_nya_hime hopefully youre fine with 1 ok-ish mog
[2:07:10] skewlbeta: not the bestial taint.
[2:07:19] emi_nya_hime: @grimblymcgoo noooo thats exactly what i didnt want! tneOhno
[2:07:19] Nulgar: oh, are the Scarlets trying to "cleanse" fallen Worgen? Yeah, makes sense they're seeing anything not 100% Human as "impure" - but I can already see how this common enemy would bring former enemies together.
[2:07:21] siber_duck: @emi_nya_hime yeah the hat is the only good part
[2:07:22] ebrahim_91: fuck the crusade excuse my language
[2:07:47] emi_nya_hime: @siber_duck man...

[2:09:41] astralumi: is Tess the same VA as Taelia
[2:10:36] siber_duck: @bucephalos combined forces of Forsaken, Worgens and 7-th Legion defeating Scarlets ain't comically bad
[2:10:55] dergNwolf: gilneas was one of the harder ones
[2:11:07] dergNwolf: actually imo the only hard one in EK even
[2:11:19] bibobeam: Is the accent a direct consequence of building a wall?
[2:11:27] dergNwolf: the dragonriding race in twilight highlands in the goblin zeppelin area was SO GOOD though
[2:11:28] grimblymcgoo: @siber_duck Comically bad that they require combined forces that are normally needed for world ending threats
[2:11:35] Drixcie: How do you get your UI to only show friendly players name, not their Health bar?

[2:20:05] astralumi: oh truee! Genn saying that while forsaken are in the room is a huge character development moment for him
[2:20:09] Karvenboom: Wait...  Light= bad?! 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
[2:20:17] RagingPunk: sweet
[2:20:22] Gaming_Mama56: I think Genn finally realized the problem was sylvanas and not the Forsaken.
[2:20:32] JMan31337: swept her under the rug
[2:20:53] kaijoe_: I dig Calia!
[2:20:57] Nulgar: should've let the Scarlets say "Make Gilneas Great Again"

[2:27:01] skewlbeta: I'm very here for the youths running things. Will give them a time to shine with their daddy issue powers combined. It'll be genuinely awesome

[2:27:52] skewlbeta: @TaliesinAndEvitel did you get to see the Shaw/Genn Anduin sighting? The animations with them are amazing.
[2:27:56] funviking99: @gaming_mama56 ppl always hate
[2:27:57] TankenFunk: "This is what wow will look like in 2019" memes come to mind tneEvi

[2:28:00] bettys_dungeon_adventures: people are going to hate but this was a great story arch
[2:28:00] the_kirkypoo: there's  a item near the grave that ports you to gilneas
[2:28:04] boubotte: i'm actually impressed at how well they handled these passings of power, they feel pretty natural and earned to me
[2:28:05] lithium364: i wanted something cool for worgen form as an reward
[2:28:21] the_kirkypoo: well gives you a toy that ports you

[2:29:14] hexbladehomo: These little mini stories wrapping up individual story arcs definitely makes up for the end raid cinematic.
[2:29:17] Nekdoo: @Sorin__ ??? what the logic behind this statement
[2:29:19] Lyrch_WV: I am @the_howlermonkey . Bout an hour west of you on 64.
[2:29:19] bettys_dungeon_adventures: heaven forbid a woman be in charge
[2:29:21] TankenFunk: I also think a lot of people being mad react to it while not playing through it. I've seen some takes that are just wrong to what actually happens in-game
[2:29:37] fathomlordcrunch: malfurion has done nothing in another expansion, calia has been on the secne for 2 minutes and sorted out 2 major citys
[2:29:45] dotonbori: New scarf added to the Drake Racers garb!
[2:29:45] RagingPunk: it was great :)
[2:29:50] bibobeam: I feel like we don't really need Calia at all though, I haven't seen anything where her inclusion added somethign
[2:29:57] funviking99: oh here we go , some people think women shouldn’t be leaders smh
[2:29:57] Rico_Azzarash: On the horde side when we are done Kalia tell us toi step out for a while and Give gilneans enjoy their homecoming, noticing that she hoping that new queen will be more aligned to diplomacy
[2:30:04] Karvenboom: I'm horde player, so I had no Ideas Shandris was the daughter of MnT. Why the different last names tho?..
[2:30:12] the_howlermonkey: @lyrch_wv  so good to see another WVian in the wild!
[2:30:14] GameingAspect: wt is gilneas like? i hvnt explored it much
[2:30:26] DiscordianKitty: i do think Calia is better as an ambassador to the alliance than a leader
[2:30:28] chronos789: Caalia was there to let Horde players in, that's it
[2:30:35] BoezIRL: @Karvenboom she's adopted
[2:30:36] redu__: @Karvenboom They adopted her
[2:30:42] KyleS07: She's effectively a neutral bridge between Horde and Ally.
[2:30:44] bibobeam: Oh no wait! the undercity questline at the end of SL was pretty dope
[2:30:55] Karvenboom: Only bromance you reckon?...
[2:31:07] dieherrlichkeit: dieherrlichkeit subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Greetings from Germany! FOR THE HORRRRRRRDE!!
[2:31:13] Gaming_Mama56: And Tess and Lillian were both The Uncrowned members
[2:31:17] the_kirkypoo: @TaliesinAndEvitel you can pick up some peaceblooms near the grave that tess left for her brother, it gives you a toy that allows you to port to the chapel in gilneas
[2:31:20] Daice_Live: 7 raiders from Daice_Live have joined! 
[2:31:35] Daice_Live: hello
[2:31:36] hexbladehomo: Is Lillian going to be like.. the horde ambassador to alliance? Shes now got a connection to both Worgen and Night Elves in Tess and Shandris.
[2:31:37] bibobeam: @the_kirkypoo This one is worgen only though
[2:31:46] BoezIRL: only for worgen
[2:31:48] skewlbeta: Only if you are worgen
[2:31:51] KyleS07: Onlyu for Worgen
[2:32:01] VimFuego1970: you can fish the canal  for a cool transmog
[2:32:11] keyboardturner: you should fish in the water at aderic's repose :D
[2:32:11] the_kirkypoo: Oh my bad
[2:32:16] bibobeam: Tali immediately went graverobbing LUL
[2:32:18] JMan31337: time for a race change
[2:32:25] the_kirkypoo: Only really played as a worgen
[2:32:33] skewlbeta: That's what the RP realm is for
[2:32:43] Lyrch_WV: Agreed, @the_howlermonkey
[2:32:47] hyugaftw: so, i jsut confirmed, that garb is useable on horde IT'S PEAK GOBLIN THO
[2:32:48] funviking99: I like it
[2:32:50] crystalsing3r: When they changed the way the females looked and the way they moved, I changed my worgen to night elf. I couldn't watch my character run or walk anymore.
[2:32:51] Rico_Azzarash: Why everyone fishing in gilbneas cannals?
[2:32:51] siber_duck: fox mount is alright
[2:32:53] Gaming_Mama56: now there are a ton of npcs so now folks can RP there
[2:32:56] ebrahim_91: when will hair happen :(
[2:33:02] Lyrch_WV: I love it the new garb.
[2:33:05] KaydenGrey: I like it overall - but i do wish the monacle was seperate
[2:33:08] astralumi: i feel like this set is missing 3D assets, specifically for the gloves and boots
[2:33:09] Karvenboom: @keyboardturner it's true for real? xD
[2:33:12] astralumi: feels like something ism issing
[2:33:12] KaydenGrey: oh i need to go fishing then lmao
[2:33:13] Gaming_Mama56: Lord Godfreys spectacles
[2:33:16] Zafarak: did he already react to night elf cinematic?
[2:33:22] skewlbeta: @Gaming_Mama56 Oh people were 100% Rping there since it came out, but now it's a bit more populated and something that you can acknowledge in character.
[2:33:25] JoeTheRedcoat: That's what 10.2.6 is, the hair update
[2:33:26] bibobeam: Darius Crowley is a gigachad
[2:33:39] girlfrmmars: Ahhh, this makes me want to check out WoW again. I don't know if my potato would run it, though it does run BG3...
[2:33:49] Mazerbeam: Empty homes = Player housing confirmed!!!!
[2:33:54] kiewies: EMPTY HOMES??
[2:33:55] rockytcp: those poor fish
[2:33:57] Nulgar: Corgo100 I've said it before and I'll now cheer it again, we need more cosmetic-only slots, e.g. separating "helms" and "masks/glasses" and "scarves/monkballs/amulets"
[2:33:58] tychgen: I rebuilt Gilneas 😂 better than devs did may I send youtube link to you?? it is not for view really , I made that for people who loves Gilneas 😂😂
[2:33:58] rilozeta: I would love to have hair work with hats
[2:33:59] Karvenboom: @girlfrmmars definitely will
[2:34:03] dwolf010: the worgen talking abou tempty homes. the elves talking about what house they want. player housing?
[2:34:04] Xanctius: this looks like BDO fishing spots
[2:34:15] REAPER_Replicator: WHY ARE THEY ALL FISHING
[2:34:20] REAPER_Replicator: sry caps
[2:34:25] ebrahim_91: @Nulgar quivers
[2:34:34] Gaming_Mama56: Worgan must have litters, there are more children in Gilneas than any other city.
[2:34:35] girlfrmmars: @Karvenboom might have to redownload and check it out, haven't played since partway through shadowlands
[2:34:35] tychgen: Sure
[2:34:42] skewlbeta: I am going to die on the hill that the rostrum customizations are going to be how we customize each element of our hose.
[2:34:45] keyboardturner: it's not rare
[2:34:49] dieherrlichkeit: muss nickname is Not a mix english/german hahaha
[2:34:53] chronos789: Crendor would disagree
[2:34:53] Nulgar: @ebrahim_91 yep, separate "Cloaks" and "3D back pieces" as well, quivers would be the latter
[2:34:57] dieherrlichkeit: muss = my
[2:35:01] keyboardturner: ~50-100 maybe at most
[2:35:05] bibobeam: Fishing stream when?
[2:35:16] dieherrlichkeit: die = the
[2:35:24] ebrahim_91: Tali getting it 10th try
[2:35:58] Nulgar: fish while you talk more about the questline and how great my ideas are
[2:35:59] tychgen: I have sent it to your whisper man in twitch! Have fun and enjoy with the rebuilt version of Gilneas. I am wondering your reaction honestly
[2:36:10] funviking99: I loved everything
[2:36:13] Mazerbeam: I hated it, because it ended.
[2:36:15] keyboardturner: I saw people complaining about the scarlets even though they're a very logical enemy to hvae there
[2:36:15] colingoodwin: I'm doing it now haha
[2:36:16] GameingAspect: tess is qeen now its great
[2:36:17] Nekdoo: I just wish it was longer ^^
[2:36:17] Karvenboom: Gameplay wise it was too samey for me
[2:36:20] fathomlordcrunch: i kinda wanted more
[2:36:22] hadamacik: yes it was very forgettable and underwhelming
[2:36:35] REAPER_Replicator: its oke, its not good but oke
[2:36:36] colingoodwin: on my worgen warrior "Roarrior, Ally of Dragons"
[2:36:37] lithium364: i wanted better rewards, where is the gilnean knight armor, or the weapon transmog that lets me use my claws as an worgen.
[2:36:42] Althalan: is something worth in gilneas or other capital cities? or same stormwind/org shenanigans?
[2:36:42] Gaming_Mama56: Loved the mount, but thats transmog.. ewww
[2:36:44] boubotte: apparently there's a stay a while and listen thingy with Wrathion and Sabellian
[2:36:53] Gaming_Mama56: The scenario was fun.
[2:36:53] KaydenGrey: i am irritated the foresaken are involved in the questline, I dont think they should have been and I won't change my mind on that. The questline was underwhelming too, it was like 5 quests and you're done. Left me feeling like....that's it? really?
[2:37:11] Mazerbeam: Is there no flight path after all this?!
[2:37:15] hadamacik: they promised huge event and we got 5 quests done in 15 minutes...reclaiming Gilneas had patch-worthy potential
[2:37:23] keyboardturner: I think people expected some big scenario like in the starting zone
[2:37:31] jersey_steve: Read an interesting theory that this could be part of setting up the Scarlet Crusade for a bigger part in the Worldsoul Saga
[2:37:35] Karvenboom: Gameplay wise it was to samey for me. Just three exact copy quest kill x + do smth. Then kill boss. I excepted more of a stealth through an enemy city (like in suramar)
[2:37:38] KaydenGrey: The cutscenes I will say though, were great - and I have no complaints on those
[2:37:39] VimFuego1970: needs a flight path and a portal to SW
[2:37:40] bibobeam: The reclaiming of Gilneas could've been a dungeon instance
[2:37:54] tychgen: Should I send it to discord DM? I am sorry honestly I may miss when you say DM. Devs only repaired some doors and bricks? I don't think they will rebuild whole Gilneas.
[2:37:56] SphericFormula: Why is everyone fishing?
[2:37:59] funviking99: they could have put a few more quests in there for sure
[2:38:11] Nulgar: omg imagine if this was a timegated campaign with several chapters, people would lose their MINDS, despite this being objectively better
[2:38:16] KaydenGrey: @SphericFormula glasses tmog in the water
[2:38:19] hadamacik: reclaiming gilneas and we used like 10% of the entire zone...gg
[2:38:46] Flanageddon: Time to reclaim Gnomeregan!
[2:38:57] bucephalos: they are building up the scarlets for something just no idear what
[2:38:59] Hippwn: I was hoping for mor of an epic mini-boss fight but I guess they want it to be easy for RPers maybe
[2:39:15] Fibnkak: afternoon guys what are you two fishing?
[2:39:16] VimFuego1970: I like the fact the Forsaken pulled out but SC moved in
[2:39:19] Nulgar: @hadamacik did you want to fight for every acre of meadows?
[2:40:00] Nulgar: @SphericFormula fishing's great
[2:40:01] Rico_Azzarash: I really like how they keep showing that Light is not "good"
[2:40:16] bibobeam: I remember that the Shadowlands characters were shoehorned in there
[2:40:22] bibobeam: Disliked that tons
[2:40:25] Karvenboom: Undercity was much better IMO
[2:40:25] Gh0stBadger: what was the addons for plates/dmg numbers?
[2:40:28] kounsboi20: kind of like the assault on the broken shore. that'd be epic
[2:40:30] hadamacik: would be better :D but they could have made the storyline longer and lore be more impactful
[2:40:34] keyboardturner: RIP, I got them in like 20 tries, but I didn't fish in the canals I was fishing at Aderic's Repose
[2:40:48] theszoti: is the music a bit too loud for anyone else or it's just me?
[2:40:59] bibobeam: Music is a tad loud yea
[2:41:01] WAKE: it should have included a multi-year siege, a winter campaign, war of attrition, light genocide etc etc
[2:41:10] keyboardturner: the geosets on that set aren't correct also
[2:41:14] bibobeam: It should've been an entire expansion
[2:41:16] skewlbeta: I need to see what those shoulders look like on a male worgen.
[2:41:21] tychgen: Tali check whispers man please 🙏🏼,  I am really wondering your reaction 😅, It is fine you watch it off stream but please check that video 😂 I am sure both of you will fall in love with that version of Gilneas
[2:41:29] MrAndersen_: hmm :)
[2:41:48] Nulgar: HypeYummy
[2:41:49] astralumi: it's weird, people complain about simple and shallow stories by blizz, but are the first to assume that stuff like titans and light are either binary good or evil.. it's like nuance doesn't exist
[2:41:51] beaconstar313: no soup for you
[2:41:55] Rico_Azzarash: Oh... Now I also want some soup BibleThump
[2:42:00] tychgen: It is original man)
[2:42:01] Althalan: hey guys... pyro is back on wow.. he's playing on an evoker named dildomancer.. what a twat
[2:42:03] keyboardturner: *** is definitely supposed to look different
[2:42:26] tychgen: Just enjoy)) my friend
[2:42:28] skewlbeta: this looks great!
[2:42:34] funviking99: awesome work
[2:42:44] astralumi: it looks beautiful!
[2:42:49] bibobeam: This is sick
[2:42:50] tychgen: Thanks))
[2:43:04] Elrathir: I just got the spectacles after ten whole casts, what a grind Kappa
[2:43:11] skewlbeta: omg that paddock is such a good touch
[2:43:17] funviking99: will blizz do anything to Gilneas in the future or just leave it like this?
[2:43:29] tychgen: Thank you very much 🙏🏼
[2:43:36] Greevers: amazing!
[2:43:44] bibobeam: I wonder if they'll do a bit more with hub cities though. It felt great to reclaim UC and Gilneas
[2:43:45] tychgen: I did it for players who loves Gilneas
[2:43:51] Nulgar: this is great, but to pre-empt any calls that "Blizzard should just do this" - this is the equivalent of concept art, it's put together without any kind of optimization, concern for players' actual PCs etc.
[2:44:00] tychgen: It is.
[2:44:00] fathomlordcrunch: liek player housing
[2:44:02] keyboardturner: very likely private server
[2:44:05] tychgen: My building yep
[2:44:10] theDirtyon3: yeah the surrounding area is gonna be interesting in the next couple month to see
[2:44:13] Hippwn: Gilneas portal in the mage tower would be nice
[2:44:24] astralumi: omg AMAZING throne room
[2:44:51] tychgen: Ahaha)) I hope you enjoyed have fun!
[2:45:03] Fibnkak: you mean the Thorn room
[2:45:18] tychgen: I gonna gift you character cinematic man, someone can send me discord link?)
[2:45:24] boubotte: apparently there's some interactions with wrathion and sabellian!
[2:45:30] BoezIRL: just got the spectacles, got it in 25 casts
[2:45:31] KyleS07: They did add seats to the chapel in Gilneas
[2:45:32] Starrwolff: Starrwolff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! almost two years now.  woot
[2:45:46] astralumi: @boubotte it's a great interaction as well!
[2:45:52] TankenFunk: Now we just need to retake Suramar city and we're all set for player housing tneEvi
[2:46:03] Nulgar: there's a prequest taking you through Algethar
[2:46:04] Starrwolff: worgen for the win!   also.. when are we getting tails??? lmao
[2:46:22] viirracocha: Wrathion and Sabelion
[2:46:25] RosieSeren: I missed getting the glasses, what's the easiest way back to gilneas?
[2:46:36] KyleS07: Prowler
[2:46:56] astralumi: above Tali
[2:46:58] Fibnkak: the mount being a Carriage will be a traders post item.
[2:46:59] funviking99: up
[2:47:15] tarnishedvalor: that area was super buggy yesterday
[2:47:26] astralumi: now a bit below :D
[2:47:26] Nulgar: maybe you need the breadcrumb from Valdrakken
[2:47:34] KyleS07: They could've done a carriage and made it exclusive to Alliance. Would've made my rogue and warlock happy.
[2:47:37] colingoodwin: Evi the real MVP
[2:47:40] keyboardturner: base of the tower
[2:47:41] fathomlordcrunch: enjoy your soup!
[2:47:46] ivashkov92: Bye Evi!!
[2:47:52] Gh0stBadger: souper hero
[2:47:54] boubotte: enjoy the soup! twas nice to see your reaction aswell evi :D
[2:47:55] Greevers: bye Evi!!
[2:47:55] astralumi: bye Evi! always lovely to see you <3
[2:48:07] Nulgar: Tali, go back to Valdrakken, there's a breadcrumb
[2:48:12] Rico_Azzarash: Waldrakken tavern
[2:48:14] Gh0stBadger: !addons
[2:48:14] boubotte: there's a quest in the valdrakken inn
[2:48:16] Rico_Azzarash: On a column
[2:48:16] Gh0stBadger: oh
[2:48:34] Nulgar: ah ok, then it was just the verticality of that area
[2:48:45] Rico_Azzarash: Cheers EVI!!!!
[2:48:48] ivashkov92: 👋
[2:48:49] Rico_Azzarash: tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes
[2:49:24] ivashkov92: Reclaiming Gilneas seems so short ☹️
[2:49:32] TankenFunk: So in the war within will we get the first on screen bang? after the first on screen hug and kiss? tneEvi
[2:49:54] astralumi: LMAOI
[2:49:57] Nulgar: @TankenFunk *interracial kiss
[2:50:02] ivashkov92: omg
[2:50:12] Gh0stBadger: LUL
[2:50:14] viirracocha: hahahahah  " the bang within"  gold hah
[2:50:17] highvolts58: I Upvote plowing
[2:50:21] Gaming_Mama56: Bye Evi great seeing you
[2:50:33] TankenFunk: I vote for Anduin and Wrathion for the next on screen milestone tneEvi
[2:51:17] skewlbeta: I have a feeling that politically it makes more sense for Anduin and Tess together even though Taelia would be better imo. Man's gonna need to get an heir in order unless they deviate from the wrynn line.
[2:51:29] Gh0stBadger: spectacular expansion
[2:51:34] Nulgar: Well, WoW turns 11, about time we up that rating to PG14
[2:51:47] astralumi: true :D
[2:51:52] colingoodwin: hopefully they wouldnt be a CRYBABY lolol
[2:51:58] colingoodwin: like their father
[2:52:02] colingoodwin: haha
[2:52:06] boubotte: as a french i'm advocating to end all of the monarchies ;)
[2:52:12] skewlbeta: Name the kid Liam. What could go wrong.
[2:52:14] HSAyril: Haha
[2:52:31] HSAyril: The blasphemous to your queen
[2:52:33] hyugaftw: do i need to do secrets of azeroth before i can do the new archives thing?
[2:52:37] Elrathir: I wanna see a cutscene of trolls kissing, I've always wondered how they make that happen with the tusks in the way
[2:52:42] BoezIRL: i love flying as an evoker
[2:52:51] Hippwn: Well and the King is a good guy so doesn't feel as bad
[2:52:55] astralumi: @BoezIRL it's soooo good
[2:53:16] Durwen: Durwen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[2:53:26] fathomlordcrunch: 1 out of 10 aint bad
[2:53:35] penguinplays1235: Im on cast 40 rn
[2:54:01] Durwen: OMFG
[2:54:09] Elrathir: not the penris again, mine eyes
[2:54:29] Sorin__: Is this covered under the artistic nudity rules?
[2:54:33] girlfrmmars: Nice
[2:54:37] beaconstar313: beaconstar313 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:54:48] penguinplays1235: Agreed
[2:54:51] colingoodwin: just watched it!! agree 100%
[2:55:01] ItssJimmyTV: itsisJimmy subscribed with Prime. 
[2:55:08] boubotte: totally agree
[2:55:13] astralumi: it was great!
[2:55:23] FCNone: FCNone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! genn's cutscenes had very strong "dad finally agrees to go to therapy after thirty years" vibes
[2:56:10] astralumi: it's an expansion epilogue, i can't understand people who criticize it for being "too emotional" or "not warcrafty enough"
[2:56:16] penguinplays1235: Yee. Totally hyping myself up too much for teldrassil lol
[2:56:23] hexbladehomo: It felt like a changing of the guard which was nice.
[2:56:46] colingoodwin: 💯
[2:56:47] GameingAspect: what sword?
[2:56:53] KaydenGrey: what sword?
[2:56:55] Rico_Azzarash: what sword?
[2:56:56] VimFuego1970: and Genn saying Tess is better equipped for a changing world
[2:56:59] penguinplays1235: Excited to see what Tess gets up to
[2:57:01] colingoodwin: 🗺️🗡️
[2:57:01] skewlbeta: very into the fact that the younger generation is now taking on the mantel. It very much lines up with the "new chapter" themeing,
[2:57:08] JoeTheRedcoat: As a blood elf player it gives me hope for whatever they do to Silvermoon in Midnight
[2:57:11] JMan31337: the world is the largest character in the story
[2:57:29] Nulgar: Regarding hereditary rulership, to quote a certain webcomic: "A mission carried on by a single family line is a perilous thing, I have often thought." "Indeed. Despite its noble cause, mine is a family like any other, in the end. You raise a child, do your best, and hope they don't start eating children until they can be silently killed and replaced by the next competent family member." "Such is life."
[2:57:30] TankenFunk: Merithra leading the green dragonflight
[2:57:34] GameingAspect: no king rules forever
[2:57:35] SphericFormula: there's a real lack of worgen in the retaking of gilneas!
[2:57:38] TankenFunk: So many daughters taking the reigns
[2:57:53] colingoodwin: as a new girl dad, that scene tugged at my heart strings, can’t lie!
[2:57:57] KyleS07: The game doesn't do a good job of telling players it's been at least 5 years since the end of BFA.
[2:58:12] Althalan: wait, tyrande and malf have never been pregnant in over 10.000 years or more?
[2:58:15] Karvenboom: Who's gonna be the next Blood Elf leader after Midnight then I wonder...
[2:58:33] ninkakittyh: ninkakittyh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Here's to 42 more!
[2:58:35] Greevers: there's been a time jump since SL
[2:58:37] TankenFunk: "Several years have passed"
[2:58:38] Calfast: @Althalan Malf was sleeping for most of that time
[2:58:40] dwolf010: ingame its 7 years ingame
[2:58:45] funviking99: woah
[2:58:47] KyleS07: Besides the 3 years at the beginning of DF. No.
[2:58:52] Gh0stBadger: your player names addon looks awesome, do you use plater for your dmg being displayed under the name plates?
[2:58:58] TankenFunk: "Seven years have passed" Kappa
[2:58:58] Rilix: they need more cinematics like the original one where it explicitly says the time skip in the opening few seconds
[2:59:05] TankenFunk: They just say several,
[2:59:14] colingoodwin: I thought they said 5 years in game
[2:59:15] TankenFunk: the "seven" thing was someone mishearing
[2:59:15] FCNone: i will never forgive blizzard for not letting us attend the wedding of matthais shaw and flynn rider
[2:59:20] colingoodwin: it was in a cinematic
[2:59:22] keyboardturner: in game it says several, never 3 but never 7
[2:59:26] colingoodwin: quest maybe
[2:59:26] KaydenGrey: seven years was the original cinematic
[2:59:36] Gh0stBadger: awesome thanks!
[2:59:37] KaydenGrey: since classic took place 7 years after wc3
[2:59:40] Karvenboom: Are the Azerothian Archivists basically a new Dragonscale Expedition which isn't connected to Dragon Isles, so they could use it in next expansions.
[2:59:42] VimFuego1970: loved how Malf woke up from sleeping for 80% of the time and went “Right, time to retire” tneEvi tneEvi

[3:05:02] Althalan: tali would you ever sit down and make peace with pyromancer? xenoxys vex did it and it felt fake as fuck...

[3:05:06] dymekfoxu: take quest?
[3:05:13] Vaephera: the tents are toys
[3:05:15] ChrisStoll: I think i'll wait on digs until they get some of the bugs fixed
[3:05:17] ivashkov92: How is the Archives event?? Any fun??
[3:05:42] wanik90: it’s like the soup, there are little things to do while you wait for your task
[3:05:50] Sindorein1124: I hope you have interact bound
[3:06:02] Sindorein1124: You will show a cast bar if you are excavating

So happy to finally be back in WoW – Got nerve damage issues (ulnaris neuritis) in my left hand in 2020, unable to play, at least at a level I find fun, since. Hand a bit better now, finally caved and tried Consoleport (controllers work better ergonomically for me, but was afraid I’d be a burden)… But just did a +25 with it, after a lot of practice. I’m so happy to be back <3 Therefore also back here – since watching before just hurt in longing.
[3:18:29] havvorthia: Loved the NPCs here though, especially the Orc woman had some great little text tidbits
[3:19:25] havvorthia: She just wanted you to try them on first
[3:19:33] havvorthia: Not use them.. yet :)
[3:19:48] havvorthia: Quest is to take then off again
[3:20:17] Nulgar: @Ghostsweeper clodagHug

[3:21:16] GameingAspect: no
[3:21:17] Sindorein1124: doesn't she?
[3:21:19] tarnishedvalor: yeah i didn't like that one
[3:21:24] realGameTheory: LuL
[3:21:32] Ghostsweeper: @Nulgar gjakeLove
[3:21:34] tarnishedvalor: i couldn't figure out the next part so i'm ignoring it lol
[3:21:48] crystalsing3r: Oh - and that's the EASY part. I've given up on that for now.
[3:22:07] Singhy: I’m back baby! been loving the podcast!
[3:22:25] GameingAspect: this weird
[3:22:29] Nulgar: the addon ExtraQuestButton would be helpful here
[3:22:33] Vaephera: it sends out a little ball you can follow every so often
[3:22:43] ArkyteCurse: Do you see the light coming out of your feet? Follow it
[3:22:47] realGameTheory: lol
[3:23:02] CeasiusPls: You get your Sub mount yet?
[3:23:11] ArkyteCurse: it pulses
[3:23:14] Nulgar: it happened just now
[3:23:15] viirracocha: he means that digging stuff
[3:23:17] Arlaeya: it took so long before I heard the radar sound and saw the whisp thing and realized... it wasn't a whisp
[3:23:17] ArkyteCurse: just happened
[3:23:22] viirracocha: goggles stuff
[3:23:24] myahkaho: you keep missing it
[3:23:25] GameingAspect: the ping sound
[3:23:29] Sindorein1124: It's like a little light that pings
[3:23:33] Sindorein1124: is your sound on?
[3:23:34] ArkyteCurse: stop looking away. it happens every time you look at chat lol
[3:23:42] grimblymcgoo: Its a worse version of archeology lol
[3:23:43] tarnishedvalor: oh god i would not have figured that out lol
[3:24:01] xd_pad: now you just need to find the testicles, wallet, and watch
[3:24:10] Karvenboom: Where the fuck do you pick up the quests?
[3:24:29] thorhod: thorhod subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[3:26:23] Singhy: Singhy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! moved to the ISA and been without my account for months. how are them mumbles?
[3:26:29] Singhy: USA
[3:26:44] ChristaStarr: doing the same quest now, nice to hear you narrating it lol
[3:26:47] MostGratuitous: Glad you're doing this, Tali. Mac client is still borked and so I can't do these quests until it gets fixed.
[3:28:40] DiscordianKitty: I don't love this
[3:28:59] viirracocha: tbh this seems waaay worst than normal archy..
[3:29:09] Eightbitmailbox: The one near the end of this quest chain was bugged for me
[3:29:12] grimblymcgoo: Old archeology wasn't that bad
[3:29:13] hexbladehomo: This is.. not fun.
[3:29:15] GameingAspect: it is terrable
[3:29:17] MeggoArt: it's a shame because the characters and voice acting in this area are all really great but the mechanics are broken AF
[3:29:17] TheSonicDwarf: you have to go earth and water to keep the gauge center
[3:29:21] Nulgar: @viirracocha tbh Tali seems to be bad at it, or at least distracted
[3:29:25] VimFuego1970: so they’ve took archeology and made it worse?
[3:29:26] mrswellrested: This literally makes no sense to me
[3:29:29] tarnishedvalor: those were really bad design
[3:29:36] tarnishedvalor: i'd rather do archaeology lol
[3:29:48] thordallim: isnt it fun
[3:29:48] GameingAspect: you gotta dig as well
[3:29:49] Singhy: another turtle made it to the water
[3:29:52] DiscordianKitty: eventually you'll be able to click on it and progress
[3:29:52] Oliraptor: wait till you get to the buggy bit  aha
[3:29:53] JoeTheRedcoat: When it's in the brown area right click like a mining node
[3:29:54] TheSonicDwarf: see the meter just above your hotkeys
[3:29:56] HatchlingMiquela: you have to click to excavation thing too when its in the range
[3:29:58] tarnishedvalor: gotta keep clicking on the main dirt thing
[3:30:01] TheSonicDwarf: make sure the line is center
[3:30:03] viirracocha: when the bar is at midle then u digg
[3:30:03] str4ysheep: dig when it's in the middle
[3:30:05] MeggoArt: you have to dig while its in the yellow bar area
[3:30:09] mattzomix: when the marker is in the middle you can rightclick to dig
[3:30:11] Eightbitmailbox: You can only dig when line is in the highlighted area
[3:30:17] MeggoArt: you only can get a few whacks in at a time
[3:30:24] GameingAspect: it gets worse.
[3:30:24] Sharxkin: this shit confused the hell out of me
[3:30:26] kiewies: Tali I can't explain how thankful I am that you live in the UK and thus start streaming at 5:30am my time. I have to work early in the AM and you and Evi's voices carry me thru my first several hours of work in the mornings.
[3:30:29] tarnishedvalor: took me like 2 hours to figure that part out lol
[3:30:35] TheSonicDwarf: it was confusing at first
[3:30:47] TheSonicDwarf: i should have read it better when i did it lol
[3:31:03] tarnishedvalor: agree it gets worse lol
[3:31:14] GameingAspect: ^
[3:31:21] GameingAspect: truue
[3:31:27] mattzomix: use the totem
[3:31:42] thunduz: so thoughts of the patch so far?
[3:31:53] Sharxkin: @tarnishedvalor yup me too it was aweful
[3:31:56] viirracocha: seems so many unessery steps to it now, b4 u just had to dig..
[3:32:46] thordallim: its like with professions, complex for the sake of being complex
[3:32:46] mattzomix: i guess it's influenced by the other players too
[3:32:48] tarnishedvalor: @Sharxkin  totally agee!  i had to do 4 lotout/ins too as it kept bugging lol
[3:33:01] Vaephera: It's not meant to be influenced by other players, but it does seem buggy
[3:33:06] the_howlermonkey: the_howlermonkey subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Where is Steve Danuser Tali!?!

[3:34:02] MeggoArt: yes this was great
[3:34:09] Vaephera: There's also a kalecgos stay awhile at the top of the tower

[3:34:31] Arlaeya: yeah get the kalecgos but if you didnt' speak to Vyra I like what she says
[3:34:33] MeggoArt: make sure you turn up the music !!
[3:34:37] Vaephera: No translation so far
[3:34:49] Vaephera: "untranslated obisidian tome"
[3:34:50] MeggoArt: the music and the voice acting here is great
[3:34:52] TankenFunk: So I'm assuming the Azerothian Archives isn't the big ol' library Tali wanted? tneEvi
[3:34:54] Arlaeya: No you did NOT miss the book, I'm complain about it every time I see it.
[3:34:57] MeggoArt: 10/10 need audio here
[3:35:03] Rico_Azzarash: Tali, what addon you use for bags?
[3:35:27] BoezIRL: did they add the netherwing in the cave this patch or were they already there?
[3:36:11] Vaephera: There's one thing that happens with neltharion at the end of the scaleborn book that seems important and hasn't been in game yet, I've been assuming that untranslated tome will tell us about it
[3:36:24] colingoodwin: which quest line is this?
[3:36:27] Blacksmith3989: Blacksmith3989 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! I think this is the first month I've subbed in ages when you've actually been playing WoW lol such a rare event! Love to you and the fam, chief

[3:39:19] MeggoArt: the worldsoul saga
[3:39:34] LolitaAldea: i feel like alextraza talks more normal in the new cinematics or maybe its just me haha
[3:39:51] thordallim: do you know if the new night elf  town is quest relatezd or can you just go there?
[3:39:52] MeggoArt: sets him up to oppose irdikron directly
[3:40:00] Nulgar: "Explained? Rah, they should show, not tell!" /s
[3:40:03] Blacksmith3989: Where do you start the Archaeolog--...I mean Archives stuff?
[3:40:03] Vaephera: Did you see the kalecgos/khadgar bit?

[3:40:31] witchhobbit: ah the blue dragonflight questline is good

[3:42:12] GameingAspect: wait the dalaran libieises have no info on this artifact wt.
[3:42:22] Saiyori: Is it just me or does Khadgar sound more tired than in the past?
[3:42:25] adamjsmithmusique: might've been asked, but do the new questlines start at the seat of the aspects?
[3:42:26] Singhy: khadgar sounding tired
[3:42:41] GameingAspect: @adamjsmithmusique yer apart from gilneases one
[3:42:45] Gh0stBadger: the npc conversations are so good
[3:42:45] Efendal: how old is khadgar?

[3:43:33] Blacksmith3989: Where's Tony's stay a while? I wanna know if he's still annoyed about being called Stoney Tony
[3:43:34] ArkyteCurse: I like how this feels much more tied to the next expansion. Usually it feels like you're frozen in time after a last patch until the pre-patch
[3:43:47] seanstrachan: They were there
[3:43:57] colingoodwin: nice mount mate!!
[3:44:06] Karvenboom: Check hillsbrad!!!

[3:44:49] ArkyteCurse: Mine didn't appear as a gift but was just in my mount collection
[3:44:52] BoezIRL: not here
[3:44:57] Arlaeya: nope not that one, did the same thing, lol!
[3:44:57] seanstrachan: No that spider cave overlooking bronze area
