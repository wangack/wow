[7:15:37] FreddiFish07: so like 20% of enemy hp
[7:15:39] balugaRWH: it‚Äôs stupid
[7:15:46] rominos88: 162 - 198 standard with 42 yrd range
[7:15:50] lHlUlLlK: hits 500 crits full gear

[7:16:51] Dracksar: dude WG is cast on 5 ppl at once
[7:17:02] WallyJustice: one thing i like about era... theres no druids
[7:17:15] Alfurias: Alfurias subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[7:17:18] KappaLordXD: Druid has cure poision
[7:17:19] marvinmc420: priest
[7:17:20] Dracksar: priest
[7:17:31] fiskensfriend: @PsheroTV u r right, ATM druids can have 26% dmg reduction, starsurge + wild growth they need to change the rune position for druids. They should have to pick between being tanky, a glass cannon or a healer. Not have the best of every druid spec
[7:17:36] Klanransalee: I cant wait for ele shaman  at 40
[7:17:47] 3rdStrikeSSB: yep he can cure poison but have to waste a gcd and mana for it

[7:19:02] cicz: as if rogues need more cc
[7:19:09] balugaRWH: @cicz it‚Äôs so dumb
[7:19:29] Klanransalee: Chain lightning next phase and overload
[7:19:34] FreddiFish07: yeah they need to put slaughter from the shadows on another slot
[7:19:39] On3Unit: You have Range slow?

[7:19:51] fiskensfriend: @PsheroTV imagine u get Dance with 40 energy ambush+BS
[7:19:56] cicz: who thought this was a good idea
[7:20:02] On3Unit: I have problem with rogues killinng me to fats as a Boomkin
[7:20:05] 3rdStrikeSSB: btw, i was toying with your spect but with shadow strike instead of saber slash. feels well too
[7:20:07] inspect4: @cicz 10 yd would be useless
[7:20:17] balugaRWH: yeah let‚Äôs give rogues a insta ranged slow but hunters still can‚Äôt trap in combat
[7:20:37] bowlsack112_: aint possible to kill a lock
[7:20:40] inspect4: @balugaRWH ever heard of feign death? lol
[7:20:42] KappaLordXD: Paladin can kill everything Paladin is roullet. You miss or crit
[7:20:43] cicz: @inspect4 well 20 is obviously too much when a hunter cant even kite
[7:20:46] hitstar98: Goooooo
