[2:01:05] Chewbracca: wait, a 53 just drowned RIP
[2:01:12] Koroberry: my guess is he got aggro first decided to run and then they switched to emi
[2:01:21] Chewbracca: @brynbbo PvP isn't a thing LUL
[2:01:25] raptor0719: No battlegrounds in this. And world pvp you have to flag yourself. I assume most people dont
[2:01:35] raptor0719: You can duel though. And it's to the death I believe?

[2:05:03] Zmalacara: miz is an idiot xD
[2:05:32] uwuphoria: i never hear good things about miz really LUL
[2:05:46] Gameboy736: I mean, goes to show why Miz is in the guild because of his streamer numbers and not his game skills
[2:05:53] Koroberry: the biggest/best advice I can give you is to never be near miz
[2:05:58] Tabun_Time: hope someone gets him that lvl 5 wand =P
[2:06:00] uwuphoria: numbers mean everything
[2:06:03] brynbbo: shots fired. i like it
[2:06:16] uwuphoria: you said it KEKW
[2:06:19] Koroberry: if he tanks anything in MC or some other raid, do not be near that and do not shoot at it :D
[2:06:23] Dogebert: Just a boy
[2:06:25] uwuphoria: what do you mean dont tell you that KEKW
[2:07:04] Gameboy736: I like the idea that people get introduced and taught how to play properly. Just don't like how cocky he is and someone else suffers for it
