[1:57:17] Nokterian: easy and fun
[1:57:19] illusion1990: do you think part of that is due to warrior sucking in SL and people itching to play it this xpac?
[1:57:39] NavalRainDrops: atleast evoker and druid is close but then nothing is even close
[1:57:59] Nehcrom: It's all about class design.

[2:00:49] Kinghorn: their new shiny child
[2:01:05] Kinghorn: nope aimassistallen LUL
[2:01:08] Calphurnious: Warriors have always been really good since always. Are the others just that bad right now for them to be this popular?
[2:01:16] PigPenLen: I don't know, I think they are making the game more for casuals not for the elitists of the game. Survivability might be what they are going for.
[2:01:24] Sweet_Lou__: yea Resto is doing so much great healing and then hitting like a truck too
[2:01:29] FlatulentFish: @aimassistallen 15% of 0% is 0% damage taken Kappa
[2:02:10] Onixqt: don't like resto druid as well, holy priest is with what I'm comfortable with as a tank xd
[2:02:13] FlatulentFish: @aimassistallen But for real, the only time I've used defensive stance is for the tree boss on academy in a +16 key
