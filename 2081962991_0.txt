[0:20:55] SkillFaker1234: is the xp buff live?
[0:21:04] marshedpotato: does the boss actually make the event more fun though? whats the reason not to just take him out and increase global blood
[0:21:44] rosbaek: just remove pussy buff imo
[0:21:45] rosbaek: makes no sense
[0:21:46] rosbaek: yeah

[0:22:15] ronke420: @guggenheim07 its 1-39 actually
[0:22:16] marshedpotato: pussy buff makes no sense on pvp server where half the players can kill you even if pussy buff is enabled, there's so many players in your zone it's not like it actually does anything
[0:22:49] xProloli: the boss causes players to group, and if nothing is doing that lower pop layers will be like 2-3s games
[0:23:02] marshedpotato: but you cant use the zone anyway right? even with pussy buff the entire enemy faction can still kill you and are all stuffed into STV
[0:24:05] dracoyn: Hi
[0:24:22] dracoyn: !faq

[0:32:58] miko3x: twisted faith
[0:33:08] dracoyn: is so low hp
[0:33:16] itsmekaisar: yeah u prob right
[0:33:19] dracoyn: one spell and you die
[0:33:38] Locktapuss: how come 3 in the resist talent? do u find 2 isnt enough for pvp?
[0:33:55] aswaran2132: !wotlk
[0:33:56] Nightbot: yes

[0:40:25] Lectortv: hydra do you still play wrath from time to time? everytime i tune in your stuck in SoD
[0:40:34] marshedpotato: i really hope they make ST the raid in phase 3. because if they don't, farming all the gear "of shadow wrath" from ST bosses is going to be a nightmare. like Drakestone etc
[0:40:59] prestonoob: the adds don’t count towards logs on this boss

[0:49:13] xtinzyx: what server is your EU char on?
[0:49:23] khourdrick: @matgr1993 you could play defensive against boomy, dispeling their 20% nature dmg inc is quite huge, scilence and fear etc

[0:50:12] gloneiric: song name?
[0:50:17] differences86: Hello Hydra <3
[0:50:34] khourdrick: it's the same against mirror s-priest vs s-priest. The shadow priests main dot dmg is the disease ur better of not in showform than in
[0:50:50] nwjames1310: Ziqo even playing? Lol now I see why all his gnomer runs suck
[0:51:25] khourdrick: now you can AFK for tidal charm xD
[0:51:31] pw_scyld: Now you can camp Prince Nazjak without drowning :D
[0:52:41] pw_scyld: on Crusader Strike EU it's generally packed, oftentimes several people at a time
[0:53:07] Mostwanted_x: i once found him while leveling on hardcore
[0:53:10] khourdrick: There's an AFk where u can see al 3 locations
[0:53:10] Mostwanted_x: and it didnt drop Sadge
[0:53:13] pw_scyld: pretty much. Due to layers closing down you can only reliably camp layers 1-3
[0:53:15] khourdrick: AFK spot#
[0:53:16] Locktapuss: oh I kinda wanna go farm that too
[0:54:14] Locktapuss: would be nice with some cheeky mace stuns
[0:54:33] vishu_tw: imagine going back in time to vanilla wow with the knowledge you have nnow

[1:01:03] smaftyz: @vishu_tw I got it at around 28
[1:01:10] Locktapuss: @vishu_tw impossible yeah

[1:31:42] Gac_Ttv: @Hydramist what class is good for fast leveling and farming gold?
[1:31:47] blondmythh: is the 3set gnom dmg good for healing too ?
[1:31:55] HeyImArty: @Gac_Ttv hunter is by far the best goldfarm class atm
[1:32:03] HeyImArty: you just sit in Uldaman doing solos all day long
[1:32:34] solstixeK1: hunt ulda farm is chill
[1:32:54] 23rhz: @HeyImArty well pretty sure a mage makes alot more boosting
[1:33:05] 23rhz: uldaman is totally rng if u get something of worth
[1:33:06] HeyImArty: ok sure but then you have to interact with morons
[1:33:06] mylittlehombre: we’re doing an 8 man shadow priest this reset
[1:33:18] HeyImArty: @23rhz Uldaman is still over 25g an hour before rares
[1:33:22] HeyImArty: in just vendor shit, greens & mageweave
[1:33:27] HeyImArty: so idk how thats "totally rng"
[1:33:28] Marcflynn_: !addon
[1:33:38] 23rhz: well 25 not good at all but well
[1:33:45] Marcflynn_: guys what's the addons is using  to have dot timers ?
[1:33:45] HeyImArty: No, but that's before rares
[1:34:08] mylittlehombre: can you do it solo with shadow priest for the trash ?
[1:34:17] HeyImArty: too much resisting
[1:34:18] bassiemon123: Oooh alt day, what are u planning to lvl?

[1:34:48] HeyImArty: ye, only hunter can consistently do it at a rate thats efficient
[1:35:34] solstixeK1: with rares, de greens and vendor etc, its prob more like 60-80g an hour, more if you get the good boes
[1:35:43] Marcflynn_: name of the addons for dot timers anyone plz ?

[1:36:19] genjimainofc: theres 3 shamans, are they just not running alpha rune?
[1:36:19] HeyImArty: Couple friends doing it atm, without the jackpot payout (pendulum), they are sitting at ~70g/hour
[1:36:23] HeyImArty: over long periods
[1:36:50] HeyImArty: Which is p good
[1:37:19] Denzax: How long do you guys think its going to take to level an alt with the new xp buff?
[1:37:31] HeyImArty: About half the time it takes to level without it
[1:37:57] HeyImArty: not exactly half the time, because thats not how the game works due to having to change zone, outleveling quests etc
[1:38:01] Revansoon: def not sub 100 hp
[1:38:50] Kaacia: Yooo, does alt mean EU or just alt class :D
[1:38:55] Locktapuss: @HeyImArty any cheeky farms a Priest can do?
[1:39:08] Marcflynn_: @Hydramist what is you addons for dot timers plz

[1:39:54] itsmekaisar: is  CAD finally working ?
[1:39:54] Locktapuss: yeah I was thinking flipping tbh - used to do that on PoE
[1:40:22] matgr1993: @Hydramist  Do u take shared pain for 5th boss in order to parse?
[1:40:28] rocky892: how’s it feel after the nerfs?
[1:41:13] Mumples: only swd a while back
[1:41:17] blondmythh: is the 3set from gnome good pvp wise (shadow=)  the token set
[1:41:21] Mumples: rest was buffed lol

[1:41:43] mylittlehombre: I really want to get voidplauge to hit 250
[1:41:51] rocky892: ahh ok I thought swd was getting nerfed again. s priests still in a good spot?
[1:41:53] Locktapuss: Does fishing take ages to level?

[1:43:53] khourdrick: Void Plague does ridiculous damage right now
[1:43:57] matgr1993: Rogues are OP in 1v1.. 40 energy mutilate is ridiculus

[1:47:47] JustOndore: I still don't know what to level with the 100% exp buff
[1:47:51] Locktapuss: is Questing more gold than grinding a good spot?
[1:48:26] mylittlehombre: underwood is 10 stamina it’s crazy
[1:48:54] mylittlehombre: and you can have two of them I think
[1:49:56] mylittlehombre: sanguine only 5 stam
[1:53:27] Mumples: 2 underworld bands will surely increase the stream quality 10x

[1:54:57] misteralarik: Which ALT u gonna lvl?
[1:55:05] rukk1: i found an addon called rogue ui does the classic aura durations, uses a different lib
[1:55:09] misteralarik: Nice :)
[1:55:41] rukk1: yeah was so bloated with other stuff ,just wanted the durations. but after i turned everything else off worked for me anyway
[1:55:53] notgarru: of course you can't get rogue ui to work, you're a priest
[1:56:47] rukk1: still can't see runes and things that are actually important, but can see swipes on normal abilities
[1:57:30] notgarru: LUL
[1:57:46] notgarru: i thought that was a banger dad joke personally
[1:59:39] rukk1: a mate spoke to the rogue ui dev about why his wasn't working, he said "Also other conflicting addons are: LargerSelfAuras, EasyFrames, ClassicAuraDurations, Dispelborder"
[2:00:31] HeyImArty: Do you feel like P2 will get stale between there only really being BGs, Dueling & gnomer to do?
[2:00:48] mylittlehombre: nice
[2:01:11] mylittlehombre: p2 already deadge but leveling alts is gonna hold us over
[2:02:32] rukk1: yeah dunno, but like you i'm losing my mind trying to just get basic information. not being able to see runes is crazy
[2:02:58] solstixeK1: man your player frame and target frame not being symmetrical triggers my ocd
[2:03:13] solstixeK1: its like 2 pixels off kek
[2:03:53] itsmekaisar: is it possible that they turn it off because reducing data why opvp in stv ?
[2:04:09] itsmekaisar: for*
[2:04:28] itsmekaisar: bless you

[2:08:37] HeyImArty: Worth getting AGM for duels?
[2:08:43] HeyImArty: alot of effort but you could easily do it
[2:09:00] prodigy_wow: agm great vs rogue
[2:09:16] HeyImArty: AB trinket is budget AMG, 3min CD aswell

[2:28:57] solstixeK1: SL meta is braindead spec, its mediocre
[2:29:18] Rogglan: not meta

[2:29:22] prodigy_wow: The rank 5 bracers arent that much worse then the WSG bracers

[2:34:04] klaber0k: @Hydramist mate do you drop shoulder?
[2:34:53] khourdrick: there's no other shoulders better than what you have. You can either get pure sp shoulders or pure eagle stat 1's

[2:50:11] Mumples: thanks
[2:50:26] foxwinkle: @Mumples it drains the caster of all mana, how much mana he has the more arcane surge deals damage
[2:50:36] Mumples: right ok
[2:50:51] dexter_delaney: they need to split pve and pvp dmg like in retail, the dmg in sod right now is just stupid
[2:51:18] Mumples: or just give more stam
[2:51:21] Mumples: dnt rly need to go that far
[2:51:47] foxwinkle: @dexter_delaney yeah I think that's why frost mages suck so bad in pve because if they buff it will be too much in pvp
[2:51:49] dexter_delaney: u still die in 1 sec with stam buffs
[2:52:09] dexter_delaney: all dmg needs to be toned down

[2:56:25] solstixeK1: Honestly they should make it global not just for wsg
[2:56:31] solstixeK1: would make it useful

[3:16:49] Thunnderhoof: hey , anyone knows if theres a limit for ranking ? can i jump from rank 0 to rank 5 if i get the honor ?
[3:16:59] Mumples: yes u can
[3:17:08] Evemode: no
[3:17:21] Thunnderhoof: some people saying its 3ranks per reset , idk if thats true
[3:17:24] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:17:37] Mumples: doubt it's true it's just hard to go 1-5
[3:17:46] solstixeK1: you cant rank to 5 in one reset
[3:17:47] Thunnderhoof: i've  got 60k honor atm
[3:17:56] solstixeK1: best is going to r2 then r5 next reset

[3:18:13] vrsswow: i saw yasterday guy with 172k honor this week
[3:18:16] Thunnderhoof: im using STV event coins for honor , thats chonk
[3:18:52] fakemejo: can u hover over buff
[3:18:54] Thunnderhoof: @solstixeK1 are you sure ? :O
[3:18:58] prodigy_wow: chingchang does for 5g
[3:19:07] Mumples: 5g
[3:19:10] Mumples: extortion
[3:19:26] prodigy_wow: phase 3 prices lol
[3:19:28] solstixeK1: @Thunnderhoof ya, getting ranker will show you the best path
[3:19:28] Thunnderhoof: yea , dinged 2 days ago
[3:19:30] Selecktt: Market on my realm is finally starting to stabilize, bringing in about 100g a day now
[3:19:38] Wolfatoms: Rerollin boomie? LUL
[3:19:59] fakemejo: assume this is only on NA
[3:20:04] Mumples: it is
[3:20:19] Thunnderhoof: i mean since they increased honor cap to 500k , u can jump to rank 5 for sure
[3:20:29] Thunnderhoof: couldnt find a blue post that u cant yet ..
[3:20:48] solstixeK1: You can decide to go r4 60% with 33k honor but you still need 45k honor next reset. Instead of doing 4.5k honor r2 then going 45k honor for r5
[3:21:17] solstixeK1: its the same amount of time just more effort going r4 isntead of r2
[3:21:25] Thunnderhoof: got like 65k atm , can get like 80k within next event
[3:21:38] Thunnderhoof: fresh char , want trinket badly
[3:22:19] Thunnderhoof: @solstixeK1 ah so ur saying u can go to r4 , that means theres no rank limits  per week
[3:22:35] Thunnderhoof: ranker is saying 56k honor should get me to rank 5
[3:22:46] solstixeK1: current limit is 4 if you got no rank
[3:22:53] Thunnderhoof: ah
[3:23:04] solstixeK1: so if you got no rank its 2 reset no matter what
[3:23:23] Thunnderhoof: i see , tyvm !
[3:24:05] solstixeK1: thats why the most optimal path is going r2 and then going r5
[3:25:07] Locktapuss: oh neat, rank 3 just from killing ppl while leveling
[3:28:20] citricxy: where’s your Bulgarian mate bro
[3:28:21] fakemejo: u seen the dueling area that they got in era now?

[4:27:06] Kreynz: but it gives a good incentive to quest to level
[4:27:11] Mumples: still is nice
[4:28:10] Kreynz: cause plenty of quests give 0 gold as well u ntil level 40
[4:28:13] Kreynz: so 300% of 0 is still 0
[4:28:50] Kreynz: still be interesting to see how much gold u end up
[4:28:54] Kreynz: minus 14g
[4:29:46] auauflo: bags early make huge diff more space more grey more gold

[4:50:05] Kreynz: riv was just playing some mage/priest with pojke
[4:50:06] aBBsaD: Why do you think you enjoyed TBC more? I felt the same and played all seasons in TBC even

[4:52:53] Kreynz: but ye
[4:53:19] Locktapuss: need to be fair to cheatersno
[4:53:23] Locktapuss: just such doggery
[4:53:26] boogy1001: @Hydramist what u dislike about cata that much and u think ur opinion changed now after 15 years?
[4:53:33] Kreynz: maybe just when they have 2 rends out it will reliably proc on 6 sec
[4:54:03] Siiroos: How big of a gold increase is it from quests with the new buff?
[4:54:09] Kaacia: In wrath it procs from the first rend tick and every 2 more after that which is 6 seconds, don't think it's random I think it literally is every 6 seconds. Not sure about cata
[4:54:40] MeisterZuk: are you on Na?
[4:54:51] Skirent: Why I still dont have xp boost

[5:04:52] gustav178: Why are there even "gaming" chairs KEKW
[5:05:00] asilay1: does the xp boost work on quest turn ins aswell
[5:05:14] Kreynz: it's like 6 years old now and still looks the same as it was new
[5:05:26] g0dzilla: @gustav178 cause "gaming" chair sells better then just chair
[5:05:36] Locktapuss: we phonkin
[5:05:40] Mumples: I just have an office chair it's not like u need a gaming chair
[5:05:41] Dextaasc2: If you could of went pro on any other game what would it be? ( dont say League)
[5:05:58] gustav178: g0dzilla i guess KEKW but i mean it gives no extra stats Kappa
[5:06:47] g0dzilla: @gustav178 its called marketing bro... you dont have to understand it... just accept it :D lol

[5:07:56] Kreynz: theres still nothing like wow arena replicated in any other game it's totally unique
[5:08:12] g0dzilla: @Mumples good ergonomic office chairs are better for ur posture then any gaming chair... so you are doing fine
[5:08:24] Mumples: @g0dzilla ye in no rush to  get one
[5:08:31] Lightshadow86: thats how broodwar died also, they just forced the whole korean scene to go to sc2

[5:08:38] Mumples: i sit in this shit for hours and never gets uncomfortable
[5:08:43] Dextaasc2: I was watching live when you told button bashers for F off
[5:09:01] Kreynz: @g0dzilla yep the chair i have is the steelcase leap which is an office chair i think, seems good
[5:09:23] Mumples: @Kreynz I just got mine from amazon
[5:09:26] g0dzilla: @Mumples i had a dxracer back when they where brand new... now i bought a office chair and its way better... i sit more straight and my back doesnt hurt anymore... big W for me...

[5:10:45] xstopi: where should i level at like lvl 27? i quested a bit in hillsb but it gets hard now
[5:10:48] pathowatch: Bring back Braindeadly and razor dildos.
[5:10:54] g0dzilla: @Kreynz the leap is a verry common one... i wanted to get the same... sadly was a bit to expensive for me... i got one for 350€ but its a german brand good quality one
[5:11:02] Mumples: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07GN4H96T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

[5:17:19] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[5:17:22] g0dzilla: @Mumples yea :) all the years i said i will never touch wow ever... cause of the token (pay 2 win), retail dlcs wich you have to buy for a shit ton of money ect... sod gave me the "try it out its not that expensive and not pay2win" feeling
[5:17:45] Kiwipizza: Yo Hydra, which neck did you choose from the quest on your main priest? :D
[5:18:11] Kreynz: dmg one is better for disc anyway
[5:18:15] Kreynz: it's only like 2 less +healing lol
[5:18:17] Locktapuss: is this a skeler mix?
[5:18:23] Mumples: @g0dzilla sod is some of best content they've done in years so was a good time
[5:18:30] Kiwipizza: Alright thanks, feel like the blue neck is almost as good anyway!

[5:19:53] flucxx: Is the XP buff live in EU or are you playing US?
[5:19:54] grylz89: Thinking about rolling a new s priest. Troll is definitely bis for pve ye?
[5:20:01] ZekoxTv: yes 25
[5:20:05] g0dzilla: @Mumples watched alot of yt content about sod and twitch streams before playing and the respons was verry good. the community was hyped wich made me trying it. and i also think its the best... even for watching on twitch its way better then retail for example...
[5:20:10] g0dzilla: its classic
[5:20:12] g0dzilla: chill
[5:20:16] Kreynz: so i discovered that you can zone into gnomer at level 20, oversight?
[5:20:37] Mumples: @g0dzilla classic is way better than retail atm imo but it can get a bit stale, that's why sod is nice
[5:20:43] g0dzilla: @flucxx hes NA and xp buff not yet live on eu
