[1:02:37] heygadzie: why u would use more mastery? is not mastery helping with groove guardians healing?
[1:02:43] heygadzie: or is vers for surviving one shots
[1:03:46] flawlesslykun: @heygadzie vers is objectively a better stat for m+ as healer
[1:03:58] flawlesslykun: as druid healer i should say (even tho most of them like it)
[1:04:12] flawlesslykun: it does damage, it does healing, and like u said, helps u surviving one shots

[4:42:19] face2face: Have you considered dropping WG conduit instead of mastery stacks
[4:43:11] Lara_TV_: I think 1st season was a big problem with the over time scores out of getting high keys from SMB, but they could implement a rapidly decaying factor after the "base" timer, so you still have to complete keys in a "reasonable" time to get any score
[4:43:37] socrates529: is there something you do to manage healing on 2nd boss fall, i seem to struggle at times on 28/29 tyran

[5:34:51] psych0914: which healer would you refer to a new healer wanting to push keys
[5:34:57] offworld__: It's sorta like Healing Stream Totem. It sits in the background and heals people up.
[5:35:40] Diisplaced: @jdotb how do you overall feel about this season? do you think the dungeons are where they should be, or should there be some nerfs?

[5:37:13] Webchika: Out of Curiosity do you like the Echo'ing Tyrstone? For me it feels like a stronger option for my Shaman with her direct heals to load it vs Druid hots... I'm debating chasing a combo of Pips / Sea Star / Blood (From EB) instead for druid
[5:37:28] zoide123: hi wanna heal rise 28 :D

[7:14:37] flawlesslykun: @Freyeth i don't even know that website, but u don't press rejuv in keys. nor do u take tranquility (unless u trying to get your cd's back faster in really high keys like jb is doing)
[7:15:11] flawlesslykun: u also don't play treeform under 28's, so just go convoke
[7:15:20] Freyeth: @flawlesslykun Ah so I could probably drop Cultivation
[7:15:39] Robert_US: lower again lol
[7:17:09] Freyeth: @flawlesslykun Why no Tree form under 28s?
[7:17:36] flawlesslykun: @Freyeth i'm also kinda new to resto druid so i don't know the talents by name, but i heard jb say several times, the right side of the tree (talents that empower rejuv) get rid of them. play budding leaves, flourish, convoke (for damage and heal)
[7:17:50] Goaliemanftw: i saw u were solely barkskinning the stonecracker barrage, do you live that naturally even without bear in +30's? i typically up for a skin+ reforestation which i see might be an overcommittment in +28s
[7:18:03] Goaliemanftw: opt*
[7:18:24] flawlesslykun: because there's no need for it @Freyeth u only need treeform for long periods of sustained aoe dmg done to your group
[7:21:38] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[7:28:06] Freyeth: @flawlesslykun Ah i mixed sth up, ye running Convoke and Reforestation
[7:30:07] flawlesslykun: @Freyeth i mean u can run treeform if u really used to healing with it, but convoke is higher damage (in theory, i find that in practice during pugs ppl just love to cuck your damage)
[7:35:15] Berriesqt: wait are you spec-ed into tranq?
[7:37:09] flawlesslykun: @Berriesqt it's a way to get your cd's back up faster during really high keys that's why u seeing it
[7:37:54] Im_anDe: gj, jb. you're doing great
[7:37:57] siaulerandom: yeah thats some kind of raid healing
[7:37:59] Robert_US: I hate that boss too
[7:38:00] Berriesqt: thats insane then.
[7:38:42] zamow1994: it is pretty dumb that you can meld/invis the debuff, shitty design
[7:39:20] flawlesslykun: @zamow1994 YEP makes me miss arcane torrent aoe interrupt back in legion days, that's how broken meld has become YEP
[7:39:35] zamow1994: yea this is worse lol
[7:39:41] zamow1994: or maybe the same idk
[7:39:51] Lokkar: Lokkar watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[7:40:07] zamow1994: just make the boss recast it you invis it
[7:40:10] zamow1994: and nerf the damage
[7:40:15] zamow1994: would be a way better boss
[7:40:24] flawlesslykun: nah this is worse. there's mecanics that for instance as a mage, you can't avoid even using invisibility, but you can with shadowmeld
[7:40:38] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[7:40:40] flawlesslykun: shit is just straight up OP for 2 expacs or more now
[7:41:07] zamow1994: i kinda like having decently strong racials
[7:41:16] zamow1994: but not this much better than other stuff
[7:41:23] Goaliemanftw: lol of all the abilities, yeah, sure. lets say shadowmeld is op...
[7:41:39] neetisTV: it'S push week, what u pushing bud :D
[7:41:44] bowlpad: jesus that tick dmg is high
[7:41:51] aarseths: wow should release a new set of dungeons every 4 weeks
[7:42:17] DKSCP_Rogers_x: what ui you using? blizzard or elvui?
[7:42:26] zamow1994: this is elvui
[7:42:27] flawlesslykun: @Goaliemanftw don't get me wrong, i hate racials are a thing. they should be cosmetic only. That being said, shadowmeld is OP. Dwarf racial is OP. when compared to all other racials
[7:43:01] aarseths: @flawlesslykun i thought you said "dont get me wrong, racists are a thing" and was expecting something completely different xd
[7:43:09] flawlesslykun: xdd
[7:44:41] flawlesslykun: i do miss old arcane torrent tho Sadge ofc every1 stacking blood elfs in legion was probably too much hence why they nerfed it, but i actualy enjoyed that gameplay. was much more pug friendly (since ppl still can't press a interrupt in 2024)
[7:45:06] zamow1994: people just all interrupt the same casts for the most part
[7:45:51] neetisTV: on this key lvl its a raid boss kek
[7:46:08] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[7:46:16] zamow1994: yea the shield mechanic doesnt really work with tyran
[7:46:17] shmmeker: @flawlesslykun they are just so unbalanced the racials
[7:46:35] flawlesslykun: NOOOOOOOO DUDE
[7:46:44] flawlesslykun: OK RECOVERABLE
[7:46:53] flawlesslykun: Prayge
[7:47:53] shmmeker: rip :(
[7:48:26] Lara_TV_: sadge
[7:48:28] siaulerandom: sucha long fight kinda bs :D
[7:48:44] vF_owen: care affix
[7:48:47] Toadcop: on 31 it's like 10 mins?
[7:48:49] unxpctd_q: damnnn
[7:48:50] shmmeker: this affix is so annoying
[7:49:05] T0shiba: why dont send BL jB?
[7:49:05] shmmeker: when u have to stand still and spam casts
[7:49:06] vF_owen: unlucko ResidentSleeper
[7:49:11] DKSCP_Rogers_x: you got a profile for this elvui ?
[7:49:11] isi_quinn_isi: that earthsurge phase sucks
[7:49:14] unxpctd_q: i wish i had your mental lmao
[7:49:14] Seakorv: what a shit boss
[7:49:24] Berriesqt: ok like - u managed your mana SO well there. what the hell lol. i find myself ooming after like 3 shields and u were chilling at 60% mana. how? lol
[7:49:26] bowlpad: nice try tho
[7:49:27] justbeachi: you want BL for the last phase
[7:49:35] devilhawk83: yep @seakorv
[7:49:38] TanaseDragos: jb can you pls show talents for this 31 tyra i am curious:d
[7:49:52] Soularnova: that boss at that level prob needs like 10 minutes dang
[7:49:59] Goaliemanftw: @Berriesqt check ur rejuv usage
[7:50:07] unxpctd_q: we go agane
[7:50:16] flawlesslykun: @justbeachi idk about that tbh. I guess things change depending if u have a aug in the group or not in this boss, especialy in tyrannical.
[7:50:23] flawlesslykun: but ye was close jb Clap
[7:50:26] Goaliemanftw: @Berriesqt its incredibly inefficient to cast rejuv and usually causes most mana problems
[7:50:28] DKSCP_Rogers_x: you using mouse over heals ?
[7:50:35] squirebdd: @DKSCP_Rogers_x LUL
[7:50:39] Berriesqt: @Goaliemanftw you think? ok ill be mindful of it
[7:51:12] Goaliemanftw: im not sure without seeing logs but its something that i changed and have been teaching people to start doing in order to avoid mana waste
[7:51:34] Goaliemanftw: if u need the mastery stacks, its ok. but most of the time, it wont heal for any meaningful amount
[7:51:47] shortsniperxbt: arent you US player , you are playing on EU also?
[7:52:15] DKSCP_Rogers_x: big/little wigs or dbm?
[7:54:48] Freyeth: What talents are you dropping to run tranq?
[7:55:36] Thoreya: awc is crazy
[7:58:34] loeamagicy: Hi
[8:01:42] Snaaade: whos the dane ?
[8:02:13] Freyeth: Thank you, I am sorry but I was wondering what hormonius blooming actually does, I dont quet understand that talent
[8:07:07] Jogiboio: thats rough
[8:08:05] MangoMafioso: at what key level does one wipe typically mean it's GG, like 28/29?
[8:08:46] Celissah: Hey man! I'm having troubles healing 2nd boss in EB with my druid. Any tips? Feels like every spell casted is heal on that boss.
[8:10:56] MangoMafioso: A lot of EB boss 2 comes down to interrupts which as a druid is tough
[8:11:04] MangoMafioso: Because you can't help with it a ton
[8:17:17] MangoMafioso: Yea bloom is way over tuned
[8:17:27] MangoMafioso: Makes this segment awful
[8:19:34] Sokchoy: cant believe we are watching the same 8 keys again instead of awc
[8:21:18] pichuux: triple dragon, how to inflict pain on yourself xD
[8:21:37] iJura: hi jb can you share your skin care? im serious

[8:47:24] caradea_: can you leave the group, use drums, and get invited back in
[8:49:40] Abyssal_Sloth: walk out key start drums to debuff your self., your group lust on first pull and your in only missing 5 sec of start
[8:50:07] Abyssal_Sloth: then u would have to make sure to drums your self again before groups lust comes off cd for second boss
[8:50:55] Abyssal_Sloth: just not sure if that 10min debuff will be in the time u want for tripple dragon
