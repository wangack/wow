[0:55:57] tarth_100: lol what
[0:56:00] NozakGaming: I didnt really see aug in the mdi which i thought was crazy. I guess they really do suck. lol
[0:56:10] sadalxx: Do you think that healing may need to be over hauled in WoW? Watched MDI, and DPS classes, and tanks, healing for as much, or more than healers has made it so that bringing a healer is a detriment. Coupled with the fact that healers are expected/required to be more DPS focused (gear, spec etc) it really diminished the average player from healing, or even trying to heal it feels like.
[0:56:20] Kymagez: could be worse could be vencucki
[0:56:24] Kymagez: like my gnome
[0:56:27] ryukotsu7: means love / like
[0:56:45] imitatewater: @venruki echo played a few games with ret instead of a healer

[0:56:47] TreySide702: yea echo running 4 dps

[0:57:00] dubbfiend: still holding out hope for hotfixes cuz I’m delusional
[0:57:02] rocketnz: Anyone got decent toons on Illidan can join us for 2nd boss on Mythic raid?
[0:57:03] NozakGaming: echo wont their last games with a druid healer
[0:57:06] NozakGaming: won*
[0:57:09] sadalxx: MDI should be 30+ keys
[0:57:09] Iridiumspx: that's what TGP is for
[0:57:14] Darkelment: that's called the great push
[0:57:18] Iridiumspx: MDI is all about speed running
[0:57:19] maxdoesmath: more relatable for viewbase

[2:38:01] danieltsmoke: lol your healer doesnt use mana...
[2:39:35] reaperz14: So who thinks we'll wake up to some changes tomorrow?
[2:39:53] reaperz14: lmao
[2:40:10] danieltsmoke: @reaperz14 I got my DH 1800 today in preparation :P
[2:40:28] reaperz14: @danieltsmoke good call man :P
[2:41:12] danieltsmoke: This healer is very fun to watch
[2:41:28] danieltsmoke: lil gnome just zoomin around, throwin out fears and shit
[2:42:40] danieltsmoke: TBH I really hope they buff feral. Its like the worst melee I've seen in solo shuffle
[2:43:39] xBenww: feral is insanely good brother
[2:43:40] Shirey12: Hello @venruki what are the chances you and Pika could convince Xar to get off that damn buy gold to win game and play retail with you two again? I miss the good ole retail vibes.
[2:43:45] danieltsmoke: good timing with the song
[2:43:45] pharmztko: hehe haha
[2:43:55] itsChefOfficial: yeah, goes to the pal every like 30s was def working
[2:44:05] Shirey12: sadge
[2:44:08] chopzpvpz: fury is so fun… ruined spec
[2:44:17] xBenww: i feel that i miss retail xar but still love the man
[2:44:19] FateIRL: i doubt hes gonna play. he said that arena ruins his schedule and doesnt wanna stay up late
[2:44:22] danieltsmoke: @xBenww think so? I feel like there's a reason them and enh are bottom of the solo shuffle representation
[2:44:23] Grimm303: @Shirey12 I dont think its a game vibe thing, theres an immense $ incentive to play classic
[2:44:26] zerotensai: affli is a ruined spec
[2:44:32] casper24411442: wantafist weaver ?
[2:44:39] xthigy: smexxin qing fury rn against the move and its lookin gross
[2:44:40] casper24411442: Lol
[2:44:41] YoMamaSoFine69: do you think you got xaryus retail viewers now since u were the second biggest mage streamer?
[2:44:55] Shirey12: @Grimm303 I get it but the gameplay is not interesting. I played pre patch TBC back in Vanilla and it's not the same
[2:45:01] casper24411442: O wait you have a god healer
[2:45:03] casper24411442: Nvm lol
[2:45:07] FateIRL: all xaryus viewers stayed with xaryu
[2:45:08] chopzpvpz: fury is good for pve
[2:45:15] Grimm303: @Grimm303 is your job interesting
[2:45:42] Shirey12: @Grimm303 Not really the navy got me out here out to sea alot
[2:46:21] danieltsmoke: This healer just literally doesnt use mana, somehow
[2:46:52] itsChefOfficial: getting full uses outta PoM for sure is helping
[2:47:23] itsChefOfficial: jk, disc
[2:47:50] Grimm303: @Shirey12 if you couuld make twice as much, and do something a bit more boring, you probably would too I guess
[2:48:12] danieltsmoke: @Grimm303 I would in a hot second
[2:48:59] Shirey12: @Grimm303 True, but sometimes it's not about money and what you love. If he chooses that I don't hate Xar. I was just seeing if he would still play retail again. Don't have to school me
[2:49:36] Grimm303: end of the day hes still gaming, he might even enjoy it more than retail, I say let the dude pop off
[2:50:03] katfished: no changes tomorrow?
[2:50:22] williwhite94: yeah i had to stop playing my boomkin in SS shits just lame af

[2:54:03] americanmoses18: i played my ret all day today...playing more haste for faster glazes super fun
[2:54:07] millennialmurphy: @williwhite94 at least DH is melee so you can get away from them, arcane mage is super mobile turret mode
[2:54:15] darkness031419: battle trance or bloodrage
[2:54:45] williwhite94: @millennialmurphy u cant get away from a good DH
[2:54:56] williwhite94: they have like 6 gap closers
[2:55:13] williwhite94: but yeah arcane is a tricky one

[3:37:51] scumlucki: Why does nobody like tanks in tier lists every tierlist i see they are at the very bottom
[3:38:48] Cephqt: why does nobody talk about the passive % spell reduction on DH?
[3:38:52] Alnop: rukiBuddy
[3:38:55] Cephqt: Spellwarden was constantly talked about
[3:39:32] mvqq: I'm sure the DH feels the same way about running after you guys KEKW

[3:40:57] mvqq: DH ONLY DID 11M
[3:40:58] mvqq: NERF FROST
[3:41:00] mvqq: HOLY FUCK
[3:41:19] Extramediums: Dh's should just be deleted.
[3:41:25] Extramediums: braindead class
[3:41:27] mvqq: no way Kappa
[3:41:49] Ceerius: we should've left DH's on the ship with illidan, one expac class only
[3:41:51] Extramediums: DH sympathizers as well
[3:41:52] mvqq: im actually curious about your opinion on this: Seems like oneshots and unhealable damage is undesirable, but how is anyone ever gonna die if CC is so bad? I think CC should get buffed, or oneshots should just b added back (aka stam buff reverted)
[3:42:27] FateIRL: things dont die already
[3:42:32] mvqq: No what I mean is, if there's no oneshots and there's no CC, how do people die
[3:43:06] Extramediums: good thing we don't playu that game
[3:43:08] Extramediums: where there's no cc
[3:43:09] mvqq: I play a DH and game does not feel fast monkaLaugh
[3:43:41] Vox42087: did you see who made a reaction video on one of your recent videos…
[3:43:41] enviscerate: I agree, make blind 8 sec again :^)
[3:43:48] Getblown: ^^^^^
[3:43:53] Extramediums: well, you see that's because when you need an apm of 10 to play DH, it must feel slow

[3:49:39] supatease: i wish wow reported player activity sub count
[3:49:46] supatease: i want to see what sod p2 is like numbers wise against p1

[3:50:00] Vox42087: thoughts on hero talent trees they recently showed?

[3:51:37] exz_96: gamers*
[3:51:40] supatease: viewership inclines me to believe its way less
[3:51:45] supatease: but the end game content is much improved
[3:51:45] Getblown: it dropped off so bad and i play p2
[3:51:46] Vox42087: OOOOO ME
[3:51:47] DoYouWannaHug: 2
[3:51:49] Vox42087: NO

[3:51:56] Vox42087: love both
[3:52:01] Extramediums: having more fun in sod than I do in retail for pvp
[3:52:03] mvqq: i mean u can look at viewership, SoD P2 is kinda poop
[3:52:03] jasonkbkt: Almost 40
[3:52:04] dadb00dy: I played p1 but yeah i dont play p2
[3:52:08] Nelsbro: i preferred end game in p1 to p2 lol
[3:52:11] affablebeef: I still play, never mained it though
[3:52:15] Vox42087: but I’m coming from ffxiv sooo
[3:52:16] Joey_Brown: didnt touch p1, only been playing p2
[3:52:16] tonshi1: didn't even go back for phase 2 but would have if friends didn't bail on it - just retail now for me
[3:52:20] illusive9073: the alternative is playing retail so i'll take sod
[3:52:21] Itankarenas: @venruki how do you get cds to anchor on the left of the hp bars?

[3:52:38] supatease: i see so many classic players critical of retail but i bet if you left a classic server up indefinitely it would be barren in a year
[3:52:41] Extramediums: @Itankarenas options menu for omnicd
[3:52:43] Vox42087: I notice less alts hitting 40
[3:52:53] Extramediums: oh yeah, that does it too
[3:52:54] Itankarenas: i have omnicd, but nothing in options shows anchors
[3:53:01] exz_96: i feel like if u main sod, you didnt experience classic fully in 2019-2020
[3:53:07] Nelsbro: @supatease same for a retail that wasn't updated at all for a year though
[3:53:07] illusive9073: classic's longevity doesn't change retail's shortcomings
[3:53:10] Itankarenas: @venruki i meant on arena frames, not unitframes
[3:53:33] mvqq: @supatease tru, retail is played actively with no updates for months KEKW
[3:53:37] supatease: mmorpgs are flawed if you want a consistent or long term growing playerbase
[3:53:47] Getblown: ^
[3:53:49] illusive9073: shadowlands was worse than wod
[3:54:01] Getblown: do we have any idea when war within drops?
[3:54:16] Anthonyjp15: At what level can you play pvp?
[3:54:23] Itankarenas: @Extramediums my omnicd literally has no options tab
[3:54:33] mvqq: tbf retail doesn't qualify as an MMO anymore, there's as much player interaction in wow as there is in League; everything is instanced, sharded, layered and group finding is automated
[3:54:37] zerotensai: @Getblown i would imagine Q3 2024
[3:54:39] Divinedb: @Anthonyjp15 19
[3:54:46] Getblown: dang not far away
[3:54:49] Vox42087: everything is flawed, perfect is a myth, and we all gonna die someday lol
[3:54:55] Getblown: maybe i cop it and get this stuff for freees
[3:54:57] Extramediums: @Itankarenas try the bigdebuffs addon then
[3:54:58] jnugs: @mvqq not if you do pvp
[3:55:08] illusive9073: @mvqq follower dungeons are the nail in the coffin for any social experience in retail lol
[3:55:12] mvqq: @jnugs spam qin arena all day has as much player interaction as league does
[3:55:15] supatease: world pvp in retail is the best i've seen of any expansion
[3:55:19] Itankarenas: @Extramediums it doesn't have one for arena frames. I want it on friendly arena frames
[3:55:22] supatease: i can go out with war mode and always find little battles
[3:55:23] Anthonyjp15: @divinedb oh okay, where do you launch pvp from, I’m new that’s why I’m asking
[3:55:33] Extramediums: I'm not on retail at the moment, so can't check
[3:55:35] illusive9073: lol what? sod wpvp is infinitely better, as was classic stv
[3:55:43] Getblown: @Anthonyjp15 should be press H
[3:55:44] Vox42087: amen
[3:55:45] mvqq: @supatease maybe at wpvp quests KEKW
[3:55:56] mvqq: which doesn't rly qualify as "world pvp" at that point
[3:56:01] Vox42087: lol
[3:56:03] supatease: ya you find the players at areas they are rewarded for going to no different than classic
[3:56:27] supatease: players are just bottlenecked and fed to areas that give xp/gold/gear
[3:56:39] mvqq: nah in classic there's players literally everywhere farming all kinds of things, and u are incentivised to do world pvp bcus u don't share everything in classic
[3:56:41] Anthonyjp15: Oh just press H, gotcha
[3:56:42] mvqq: i.e herbs, mines etc.
[3:56:43] illusive9073: you can't really argue with retail shilling tbh, esp when the claim is that retail wpvp is the best its ever been
[3:56:48] Interzention: isn’t world pvp just non instanced pvp?
[3:57:16] mvqq: there's no organic wpvp in retail because there's no reason to be in the world
[3:57:24] Itankarenas: no
[3:57:41] mvqq: and the shit u do in the world is shared anyway so why fight over it
[3:57:43] Vox42087: right now camping the sleeping bag quest is all the fad
[3:57:45] CabinetMistake: i'm just amazed how many people in low cr ss don't kill any totems ever
[3:58:07] DoYouWannaHug: @CabinetMistake Happens in higher CR as well
[3:58:14] illusive9073: being on a pvp server and still being able to toggle pvp off via war mode. such good wpvp
[3:58:14] CabinetMistake: @DoYouWannaHug now that's depressing lol
[3:58:23] supatease: the reason people go in the world is to farm professions / world quests / pvp quests
[3:58:28] supatease: how is that any less organic than classic
[3:58:33] DoYouWannaHug: You'll have healers killing observer/totems @CabinetMistake
[3:58:35] illusive9073: show me the warmode button
[3:59:04] nameyourform: everytime he gets cced he moves in his chair haha its funny
[3:59:07] nameyourform: i do the same thing
[3:59:12] jasonkbkt: Gold in retail is meaningless, as opposed to classic
[3:59:15] supatease: the end game world pvp experience is bis in dragonflight
[3:59:21] CabinetMistake: @DoYouWannaHug yeah i'm a healer and so far i'm the only one killing tides at my cr lol
[3:59:32] illusive9073: selectively ignoring things i see lol
[3:59:59] DoYouWannaHug: @CabinetMistake At least you are killing them good on you.
[4:00:05] foxyllama: TRUEEEE
[4:00:07] foxyllama: SOD IS THE FUTURE
[4:00:10] CabinetMistake: trying to improve @DoYouWannaHug  o7
[4:00:13] mvqq: Like, everything in retail is shared. Tags, mines, herbs, mobs, literally everything. But in Classi u gotta compete for everything
[4:00:14] jasonkbkt: U need to go out in the world in classic to make gold to make progress for you character. Retail u can sit in main city and q
[4:00:15] Vox42087: more predatory
[4:00:18] Getblown: it is whoever hits first
[4:00:28] illusive9073: if you die, you're probably dying to wpvp lmao
[4:00:28] supatease: go do some world pvp ven
[4:00:31] CabinetMistake: i thought ven was gonna stream like foxy for a second
[4:00:37] supatease: some of my best youtube videos and moments are from world pvp interactions
[4:00:45] foxyllama: stergeSups
[4:00:48] exz_96: retail has wow token which makes the world meaningless id say
[4:00:53] mvqq: ORGANIC world pvp is fun, but organized world pvp sucks (i.e 40 man v 40 man)
[4:00:56] Disparage: anyone seen my lawn mower?
[4:00:58] Gumjob69: wpvp is trash 95% of the time
[4:00:59] exz_96: classic was fun until the wow token in wrath
[4:01:03] mvqq: but randomly meeting some diosgusting gnome taking my mine node i will destroy him
[4:01:07] CabinetMistake: supaShoe
[4:01:13] illusive9073: watch some warcraftmovies and then tell me retail wpvp exists lol
[4:01:27] xGriefxGodx: 1 of 25 big dam
[4:01:48] jasonkbkt: Classic is a hands down a better MMO.
[4:01:57] Joey_Brown: bgs are the future
[4:02:12] illusive9073: time to log into retail and follow a big tree around again
[4:02:12] Itankarenas: it's possible to think both are good btw
[4:02:20] Itankarenas: I like SoD and retail
[4:02:22] supatease: u dont have to do the 40 v 40
[4:02:24] beardsellsyyc: Bigdam is a monster, hes pumps like crazy
[4:02:26] jasonkbkt: I love retail
[4:02:31] supatease: the 40 v 40 people are the sweats who only want the world pvp gear for their rating
[4:02:39] supatease: if you just go solo into the world you get experiences like this
[4:02:43] supatease: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v8YDW5bcDk&t=182s&ab_channel=Supatease
[4:03:15] jasonkbkt: Not really, only thing u see in retail world are legit bots
[4:03:18] Itankarenas: I thought the ashenvale event was cool when the massive groups of players clashed and it became like 80v80
[4:03:23] Getblown: how long does it take to get your pvp gear now in retail
[4:03:32] Itankarenas: the event itself was pretty meh, but the fights were fun
[4:03:36] illusive9073: @supatease the opposite of pvp? you slow falled to safety and then flew off lol
[4:04:00] shibbydibby22: u see a lot more than bots  in retail lol, only in old zones do u see a ton of bots unless ur server is just dead and that’s all u see
[4:04:35] supatease: the mmorpg elements are still in retail players have just trained their brains to only feel dopamine if the content is contributing to their gear/rating going up
[4:04:36] Moobot: Latest video "Retail PvP Is Plagued With Problems Right Now… And Players Are Not Happy" view it here: youtu.be/sTd8uoLysI4
[4:04:53] mattyxoqt: i javent seen too many enhancment shamans
[4:05:05] CabinetMistake: big damn still doing it up don't worry @mattyxoqt
[4:06:20] jasonkbkt: You don't NEED to go into the world in retail for really anything. You NEED to go into the world for classic.
[4:06:31] illusive9073: are profs still clunky as hell?
[4:06:43] CabinetMistake: @Getblown really fast now i came back about 2 and a half weeks ago and already in full conquest
[4:06:47] illusive9073: retail profs are more complicated than the game itself
[4:06:59] mvqq: @supatease Idk about that, in classic your player power required you to interact with MMORPG elements of the game - On retail your player power is gained from instanced content only
[4:07:22] illusive9073: ^
[4:07:24] jasonkbkt: You will run into far more organic pvp interactions.
[4:07:25] illusive9073: sitting in m+ doesn't count

[4:07:39] Lamatastisch: there is no reason to go out in the open world in retail
[4:07:48] Lamatastisch: even if you want to farm gold, its a bad place for that
[4:08:13] xGriefxGodx: Frown town
[4:08:18] supatease: idk you guys dont even try
[4:08:19] markaimfire_: that comp is wild
[4:08:23] nameyourform: BIG DAM
[4:08:26] supatease: i legit went out in solo shuffle q and found really fun world pvp on my warrior
[4:08:40] supatease: even in dragonflight being at the low point of an expansion life cycle
[4:08:51] Itankarenas: I had fun in zaralek getting bloody tokens
[4:08:55] jasonkbkt: It's there but it's meh
[4:09:01] Itankarenas: but now i dont need em so...
[4:09:08] JmanOwnz: I think wpvp is great in dragonflight
[4:09:30] jasonkbkt: Being able to just fly away makes it meh
[4:09:47] mvqq: LMAO
[4:09:49] JmanOwnz: lots of ways to get people off their mount tho now
[4:10:06] Getblown: that is my life
[4:10:08] xGriefxGodx: @jasonkbkt real shame I don't have to suffer through corpse grinding and be camped by a bunch of no life boomers who are individually terrible at the game but gang up in numbers.
[4:10:09] Getblown: don't ahate
[4:10:18] Getblown: im jking
[4:10:21] markaimfire_: I'm one of the psychos who enjoys it 4Head
[4:10:26] Dakkoro: Yeah I like 10m arena matches more :D
[4:10:27] Dakkoro: jk
[4:10:44] exz_96: hey ven ur good at the game maybe u shuld compete
[4:11:00] exz_96: Kappa
[4:11:38] ZeroOmegaLul: @exz_96 What's your armory link? :)
[4:11:56] jasonkbkt: @xgriefxgodx don't get butt hurt
[4:12:10] Intravz: ven is too good. wouldn’t be fair to other competitors
[4:12:14] Smoothez: frost hits like a wet noodle :(
[4:12:15] kkubby: ven literally has a blizzcon trophy he doesnt need to compete
[4:12:18] illusive9073: what are wow sub numbers rn?
[4:12:19] Lamatastisch: Doing the questchain for the paladin mace at lvl 25 in SoD was REALLY fun imo. Was a nice thing to do besides the other stuff and it felt like a little"adventure"
[4:12:31] Itankarenas: where the priest pathing?
[4:12:53] jasonkbkt: Fly absolutely destroyed all organic interactions in wow
[4:12:53] CabinetMistake: @Lamatastisch does every class have a little questline like that in sod? that does sound nice
[4:13:12] zerotensai: nice
[4:13:13] JmanOwnz: clean 💯
[4:13:16] Lamatastisch: Not sure, I only played paladin. But I know there is one for warrior at lvl ~30
[4:13:19] Disparage: What is H
[4:13:19] Dakkoro: Hit that guy with your attacks
[4:13:46] Itankarenas: @CabinetMistake no, it's not every class. those quests are from standard classic
[4:13:59] supatease: i dont think any classic mmorpg element suddenly makes retail have a billion players and grow
[4:14:09] Getblown: welcome to classic
[4:14:14] xGriefxGodx: @jasonkbkt Not butthurt, I play retail
[4:14:14] Itankarenas: double loot drops
[4:14:15] illusive9073: that's fair, way more rng to classic. you have to have fun in the getting there more than the being there
[4:14:16] Itankarenas: easy
[4:14:20] Nelsbro: at least gear doesn't matter as much in classic
[4:14:27] jasonkbkt: Some things you just can't undo
[4:14:34] limit77: HSWP BuddhaBar 💯
[4:14:38] markaimfire_: gear is everything in classic
[4:14:40] mvqq: MQG rly traumatized u huh
[4:14:42] supatease: were in the hype train era of gaming
[4:14:43] jasonkbkt: I play retail also
[4:14:50] kkubby: i feel like its all world buffs
[4:14:53] CabinetMistake: @Itankarenas aha
[4:14:54] supatease: the only way retail gets more players is to release content on a faster cadence
[4:14:54] Dakkoro: in pvp gear doesnt matter too much. At least not in vanilla. Everything dies too fast in pvp for it to matter
[4:14:57] GnarstyTV: outside of mqg/dst thats really not the case
[4:15:04] markaimfire_: If you want a complete build you better be in a solid guild
[4:15:08] Dark_Wave1: Ven what's your top 3 xpacs of all time?
[4:15:08] jasonkbkt: I love retail, just not the same game
[4:15:12] casper24411442: No matter what man gear matters in every xpac
[4:15:33] casper24411442: He'd rather have an advantage
[4:15:36] exz_96: give retail a pvp battlepass and ez GG
[4:15:37] supatease: people who want gear to matter more than skill are unskilled players
[4:15:43] affablebeef: TRUE
[4:15:44] Joey_Brown: I get quinns perspective more than your tbh
[4:15:51] Hydrixi: I don't like the choose your load-out type game
[4:16:01] casper24411442: Quinns is fucked
[4:16:06] Onshuffle: me
[4:16:07] bones422: me
[4:16:07] kubie: ME
[4:16:09] casper24411442: I do god tier Ven
[4:16:09] Suited_Monkey: +1
[4:16:10] nerfurface: me
[4:16:10] nahjwanbebar: me
[4:16:11] xGriefxGodx: me.
[4:16:11] muhfin: love it
[4:16:11] CabinetMistake: 10000000000000% made the game SO fun for me since coming back
[4:16:12] arcane_p: that is the best part of retail
[4:16:12] millennialmurphy: ME
[4:16:12] JmanOwnz: prefer that lol
[4:16:13] Dizzlx: even playing field for sure
[4:16:14] zerotensai: love it
[4:16:14] Dakkoro: I like grinding gear because its more of an RPG type thing
[4:16:16] muhfin: wouldnt play retail if not for that
[4:16:16] jhambone24: sklill based all the way
[4:16:17] oaysis: yea grinding is lame
[4:16:20] rebelking: i lik eit more
[4:16:20] supatease: I think weakauras is omega stupid for an addon but I also think disabling addons does nothing to increase sub count
[4:16:22] eygton: me
[4:16:22] Dizzlx: blizzard plz just let me play the game
[4:16:25] rebelking: less bg afking
[4:16:26] Gumjob69: me i love it
[4:16:29] foxyllama: iperfer the month grind cuz then im always better than slackers
[4:16:33] arcane_p: When retail gatekeepers gear is when im frustrated
[4:16:34] bones422: I don't wanna be punished for wanting to play other classes/specs too
[4:16:36] illusive9073: the problem is all the "me"s that you get lumped with that make the game unenjoyable because they have the ilvl and don't care to win
[4:16:38] Onshuffle: i love being on an even playing field and getting farmed by rank 1 glads at 2.1k
[4:16:44] xGriefxGodx: @foxyllama WHAT THE FUCK IS UP FAXY LLAM HEY BUDDY
[4:16:54] jasonkbkt: I just started playing sod doesn't really seem like that so far
[4:16:55] kubie: pvp should have always been more skill based than gear based
[4:16:57] thrakzr: We got you on the projector in the gym right now, all the boys say whaddup!
[4:17:35] Dakkoro: @kubie honestly no, not in an MMO. We have mobas for that
[4:17:55] mvqq: WOTLK is perfect example of Gear having too much of an influence; Arena in that game is unplayable unless you raid every week
[4:18:07] kubie: @kubie then you have classic
[4:18:29] jasonkbkt: Wrath was terrible
[4:18:55] jasonkbkt: Wrath classic was even worse
[4:19:31] mvqq: Here's what's wild tho, people thing Rewards in Arena is too shit and that's somehow a reason why people aren't playing, but in League you literally get a shitty skin at the end of the season and that's it and people still play the fuck out of it
[4:19:57] itsrikodeine: @mvqq FREE > $15
[4:20:02] xGriefxGodx: @jasonkbkt Wrath was fucking awesome the first time. You're out of your mind.
[4:20:12] mvqq: @itsrikodeine true, make wow free
[4:20:33] millennialmurphy: Wrath (the OG) was one of the best expacs
[4:20:35] KombatWombat07: wrath was the best when it first came out and that was it
[4:20:36] Getblown: im on the fence of playing retail and thats not good
[4:20:41] Getblown: p2 really p**** the bed
[4:20:43] jasonkbkt: It was meh at best
[4:20:51] mvqq: @Getblown ye STV event is so shit
[4:21:02] Getblown: such a gimmick
[4:21:05] mvqq: and all the rune puzzles are so boring
[4:21:12] millennialmurphy: I mean if Wrath was meh, then you must not play WoW, cause all other xpacs (except panda) until now were HORRIBAD
[4:21:15] jasonkbkt: Why is the stv event shit?
[4:21:21] Joey_Brown: Can I just ask, what is the point of gear in pvp then? Ideally it would be more like any instance arena game like league or overwatch, no?
[4:21:26] mvqq: @jasonkbkt lag, u cant get on the same layer as ur group, etc
[4:21:38] Getblown: i should be a DH andy
[4:21:41] jasonkbkt: They fixed the lag
[4:21:59] jasonkbkt: IDK about the layer thing
[4:22:10] foxyllama: crazy how you guys are just flaming the older version of the game just cuz u guys were never good at it, no wonder you guys hate the past
[4:22:24] mvqq: LMAOOOO @foxyllama
[4:22:26] Getblown: LOML
[4:22:27] everlivingquinnviewer: KEKW
[4:22:29] five_moke: the price of rate my xmog is to damn high!
[4:22:30] mvqq: i bet ure not wearing a shirt rn mvqqJames @foxyllama
[4:22:30] Disparage: Still curious who gave the green light on giving rogue divine shield

[4:22:36] Dakkoro: Classic overall is a MUCH better game than retail lmfao.
[4:22:39] Dizzlx: the fact that we've come so far is amazing. All pvpers ever wanted to do was queue up arena and there were just so many barriers
[4:22:56] foxyllama: i make everyone thirsty
[4:22:58] FkPveNerds: @Dakkoro no shot
[4:23:08] Disparage: @foxyllama ur just too handsome
[4:23:46] Joey_Brown: But what I think I'm hearing is there is no reason for gear progression in WoW, just like these other games
[4:24:16] millennialmurphy: the issue with classic was that if you wanted to PvP, you had to play as a job, if you wanted to do raids, you had play as a job, game might be easier now, but at least the whole player base can experience the game now
[4:24:17] foxyllama: i wanna see arcane
[4:24:31] jasonkbkt: I enjoy character progression, retail has 0 character progression
[4:24:36] reaperz14: I wonder if blizzard cares about PVP
[4:24:57] foxyllama: im gonna play my first game on stream this week soo
[4:24:58] foxyllama: lmao
[4:24:59] FkPveNerds: @jasonkbkt delulu
[4:25:02] Intravz: @reaperz14 they dont
[4:25:38] nameyourform: foxy arcane impression incoming. instead of meatball it’s spellsteal
[4:25:43] jasonkbkt: @fkpvenerds English?
[4:26:21] FkPveNerds: @jasonkbkt how old are u to not know delulu lmao
[4:26:31] likeapro1337: Guys any news if season 4 is gonna be here? Hence many people say this is the last raid boss
[4:26:32] Joey_Brown: Would love to hear your thoughts Ven, what do you think about gear progression in WoW pvp, does it have a place or should it go away?
[4:26:47] jasonkbkt: Too old apparently
[4:26:49] Guelag: @FkPveNerds a lot of kids play wow too man its not 2004 anymore
[4:26:59] markaimfire_: Ven, what's your story in music preference? We are around the same age. The music reminds me of my dad
[4:27:18] xvpsp: what is the best comp for mage frost for 3s right now?
[4:27:21] Levon117: just found a group in lfg called scumbag fotm cleave guess what it consists of
[4:27:23] FkPveNerds: @Guelag yes but it was about saying "delulu" lol
[4:27:26] arcane_p: Being able to Quickly gear up and play other classes is also a huge selling point that makes retail awesome
[4:27:29] mvqq: Tokyo drift is my fav movie
[4:27:29] five_moke: the game feels good, but there are still classes that need to buffed and nerfed to bring more variety to the game
[4:28:03] KombatWombat07: tokyo drift is my favorite terrible movie to watch
[4:28:05] Dakkoro: One thing I dont like about retail is the CD based gameplay and the balance is always lame.
[4:28:30] hunchurio: feral is the worst dps spec  @venruki
[4:28:43] Getblown: how are dks nowadays
[4:28:43] Disparage: @hunchurio false
[4:28:55] jasonkbkt: @fkpvenerds good job making up words.
[4:29:13] jasonkbkt: Reminds me of a 5 yr old
[4:29:14] hunchurio: @Disparage it's frost mage? at least they have some utility
[4:29:24] FkPveNerds: @jasonkbkt should've googled it
[4:29:59] FkPveNerds: do you have the google on the internet thing
[4:30:03] jasonkbkt: For what
[4:30:27] FkPveNerds: lmao
[4:30:55] jasonkbkt: Your name is fkpvenerds, that in itself tells me your mom probably pays for your sub
[4:31:11] markaimfire_: lol
[4:31:13] FkPveNerds: yes she does, and?
[4:31:14] Disparage: @hunchurio Think fury warrior is the worst tbh
[4:31:31] Asake2K: @FkPveNerds LETS GOO PVE GANG
[4:31:35] zerotensai: ya why u hating on momma
[4:31:49] drdoomkinx: 2s on frost mage has got to be the worst thing to do LUL
[4:32:05] jasonkbkt: Trust I don't hate his momma
[4:32:20] five_moke: I wish they would get rid of those stupid icicles
[4:32:30] FkPveNerds: @jasonkbkt you couldn't even take 2 seconds and your last braincell to figure out what "delulu" meant
