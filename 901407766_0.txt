[1:03:22] Kinghorn: I can level other adventurers again
[1:03:26] Hoothor: But Titanforging doesn't make loot interesting.
[1:03:37] metavahn231: people are starting to quit not that they all have
[1:04:24] Hoothor: Imo, Titanforging make loot so much more apathetic. Its RNG layered upon RNG such that you have little to no agency over what you get. At least right now you know what you can get and where.
[1:04:44] shimwood: ^
[1:04:58] Hoothor: I agree that It feels bad to do massive amounts of M+ or raiding and get next to nothing, which is why I think they should bring back badges.
[1:05:01] metavahn231: dont know what youre geting vault could give you rubbish
[1:05:20] metavahn231: you just sit there all week hoping vault isnt trash
[1:05:22] Kinghorn: I had 2 shit vault weeks in a row
[1:05:29] metavahn231: boring system
[1:05:42] Anguyen92ab: Like the previous chest system was any better
[1:05:56] Anguyen92ab: One chance and you get nothing, too bad. Wait next week
[1:05:58] Kinghorn: you actually got loot from dungeons and raids back then
[1:06:01] metavahn231: would rather just have tokens then THIS
[1:06:16] Hoothor: Badges were done away with precisely *because* of Titanforging. Because in order to make TF even seemingly balanced they needed to shower you in loot, 99% of which was garbage
[1:06:32] Hoothor: So having a badge vendor was moot
[1:06:42] Coil_Twitch_Bot: cheer100
[1:07:09] Hoothor: Thats not the case now.
