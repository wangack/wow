[0:09:48] Kaekias: good afternoon hydra and chat! hydraLeigh
[0:09:53] PriestHealerx: How should I make gold? im poooooor
[0:10:04] dreeeamyy: kinda wild blizz still cant detect flyhackers yet
[0:10:09] dreeeamyy: @kaekias 👋🏼
[0:10:28] Kaekias: leveling EU? or 2nd NA?
[0:10:30] antelopeTV: you think they nerfing SP next?
[0:10:33] canaryofc: i mean yea, but we gonna get something @nike_rise
[0:10:35] jazni_23: i make savory deviates for gold, seem to sell all the time
[0:10:41] DeathToad007: did shobek get banned for getting boosted by that fly hacker? he hasnt been on in like 3 days
[0:10:42] Creampuff1112: a stack of heavy leather was like 2g 3 days ago,now its 60s
[0:10:50] twitchara7: if sp get nerfed then rogues also need to get enrfed..
[0:10:52] twitchara7: nerfed
[0:10:54] Azizxoxo: are you winning, son?
[0:10:55] nike_rise: @canaryofc nah were fine in pve they arent gonna throw crazy balancing around for pvp
[0:11:09] canaryofc: they did for boomkin? shadow worth death just as bad
[0:11:17] canaryofc: word*
[0:11:33] nike_rise: its not as bad as starsurge
[0:11:37] ungodlyxdx: whats with the ohms for character name
[0:11:37] prodijftw0: Glad npc
[0:11:49] canaryofc: seems like some massive copium
[0:12:06] jazni_23: is imp renew + renew rune worth going for?
[0:12:08] Kaekias: @ungodlyxdx anti getting sniped (streamer) addon
[0:12:15] canaryofc: i like that change
[0:12:17] ephixa_fan: hi
[0:12:39] plsnojebait: ohms on homonculus making me want to vomit
[0:12:40] JavaSkrpt: Fair trade
[0:12:44] canaryofc: yea
[0:12:46] Devii7: but they have to be careful, because right now death is also keeping us up in PVE. Blizzlike would be they overdo it and push us back to the dumpster
[0:12:59] AdamNicholsMusic: i get bursted so hard by spriests on my lock
[0:13:00] canaryofc: power on instant class = retail shit
[0:13:05] canaryofc: instant casts ruin game
[0:13:14] canaryofc: no counters except more stuns
[0:13:20] JavaSkrpt: I think PVE balance for Death and Mind Spike buff would balance well in PVP, in this situation.
[0:13:30] Norcal90: @Hydramist in your opinion what would you say are the worst/ weakest classes in pvp right now which need buffs /help?
[0:13:41] Devii7: yes, if you touch death, you need to touch spike for pve
[0:13:49] twitchara7: rogue realy hard to beat as sp imagen with nerf
[0:13:54] JavaSkrpt: Right, which I think is the fair choice in PVP too
[0:14:11] JavaSkrpt: Free casting MS during BGs should feel better than walking in and out of engagements waiting for Death CD
[0:14:25] Devii7: but I fear blizzard doesnt think about taht
[0:14:42] plsnojebait: they literally nerfed starsurge and replaced it with shadow word death
[0:14:46] JavaSkrpt: I don't see why they wouldn't - they may not implement but that doesn't mean they wouldn't consider the trade
[0:14:56] frozenpizza2209: SP need nerf :D
[0:15:14] twitchara7: rogues are crazy now aswell xD
[0:15:23] KEK_Jinx: the silence is really nasty
[0:15:27] canaryofc: rogues mut needs to be 50 energy
[0:15:31] canaryofc: at a min
[0:15:35] nike_rise: @Hydramist what would you pick out of druid, war, rogue
[0:15:37] frozenpizza2209: can 2h enhance one shot? pls say yes
[0:15:41] frozenpizza2209: or I have to reroll rogue
[0:15:47] mercifultortoise: Rogues whine more cuz they cunts so they prolly get less nerfs
[0:15:50] Gulfen_: burst across the board is pretty crazy, I was barely able to hardcast anything in blood moon
[0:15:51] Norcal90: @Hydramist in your opinion what would you say are the worst/ weakest classes in pvp right now which need buffs /help?
[0:15:58] plsnojebait: frost mage
[0:16:28] DeathToad007: rogues are flying under the radar  priests and melee hunter taking all the shots on reddit
[0:16:30] plsnojebait: any caster that needs to actually cast a spell
[0:16:34] fullphat26: Cant choice between lock and priest omg ><
[0:16:38] fullphat26: choose
[0:16:44] twitchara7: i think r 14 priest gonna beat every class in sod
[0:16:45] Kaekias: flip a coin
[0:16:50] AdamNicholsMusic: wanted to play destro lock but its all cast
[0:17:10] plsnojebait: ya its almost impossible to root or snare now
[0:17:12] canaryofc: 1000%
[0:17:21] frozenpizza2209: when we get to 60, we'll all see that vanilla was bis lol
[0:17:32] AdamNicholsMusic: I really hope it doesnt head towards retail. Mobility runes worry me
[0:17:45] KussTV: cast knockback really needs a cap.  shouldn't be spending 5-6 seconds casting a mind blast
[0:17:48] dripped_dudley: dw theyll complain about rogues when priest and hunters are nerfed
[0:17:49] dreeeamyy: im abit afraid blizz is over-doing it atm in SoD, cant stray too far away from Classic
[0:18:33] sinsin935: @hydramist it can spawn where the staircases are on both sides ☺️
[0:18:42] DeathToad007: its in the rooms with stairs usually
[0:18:44] sinsin935: ok top
[0:18:45] KEK_Jinx: has multiple spawns
[0:18:52] sinsin935: on top ye
[0:18:54] Kaekias: i think it has like 5 spawns or sth
[0:19:46] Kaekias: oh, how was your gnomeregan run yesterday, by the way?
[0:20:09] Kaekias: aww
[0:20:15] Kaekias: hydraF
[0:20:20] prodigy_wow: Unlucky
[0:20:56] nike_rise: so far i got boots and the trinket
[0:21:26] meepocherie: is gnomer belt better or AB belt better? hit seems good
[0:21:29] frozenpizza2209: enhance need 3 extra wf proc
[0:22:21] meepocherie: which one is bis for pvp?
[0:22:31] Gulfen_: that belt dropped in my run. lost it to the mage healer

[0:27:02] hughjasses: ur pumpin
[0:27:09] Inzio: boomkin would be fine if they fixed the pushback with eclipse, you will nost cast a single starfire with a decent melee sitting on you
[0:27:15] Inzio: not*
[0:27:33] Inzio: they wanted to make them casters and didnt even fix the bug that keeps them from doing that
[0:27:45] hughjasses: it's so easy to farm blood in stv with swd, sniping kills left and right

[0:35:18] meepocherie: wow official site says US is up, but retail seems still offline. can you try US again?
[0:35:34] Kaekias: the computing power required to actually calculate gotta be immense
[0:35:45] boogy1001: boogy1001 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[0:35:49] Morlac13579: it would require a great deal of manual input ontop of an algorithm
[0:35:50] Kaekias: hydraSub
[0:36:43] Snewch: It's up
[0:37:11] Mystiggo: I tried to make shadow work from ~33-36 but gave up on it and went back disc
[0:37:21] Mystiggo: it wasn't bad but just didn't feel like I was getting much benefit from my talents
[0:37:42] Mystiggo: shadow focus is nice but that's about it
[0:38:16] KioskHasse: does void plague count as a shadow spell?

[0:39:53] KussTV: I heard you can farm a fire elemental associated with a mage rune.  Rapid respawn, normal loot table, and drops expensive fire item
[0:40:22] prodigy_wow: if you dont make a tier list, they wont make any changes LUL
[0:40:33] AdamNicholsMusic: locks feel really balanced in pvp atm
[0:40:42] Selecktt: Every melee got deep dicked by the 4,500 armor change to bosses
[0:40:44] jerotw: thumbs up for that nerd parody
[0:41:07] Selecktt: Bosses in gnomer have more armor than ragnaros.
[0:41:11] HeyImArty: No, the bosses just have higher armor value than MC bosses
[0:41:34] HeyImArty: guess they wanna keep melee in check
[0:41:39] Selecktt: Fuck every melee class that's why. 45% damage nerf.

[0:45:38] Selecktt: "Search words" is LFM/LFG/whatever. You put the terms in a specific area. I use arenas
[0:45:43] Selecktt: then you tick the arena box in filters
[0:45:59] brightonian: cmon dude don't do us oldies a bad service

[1:40:52] Waterwalk: at zenlyn, do you even sod or stilkl retail holy priest pump?
[1:41:07] Zenlyn: i just like watching hydra play sod
[1:41:17] Sinostra: and they do reset aggro
[1:41:21] Sinostra: after some time
[1:41:23] Revansoon: bank made gg go next
[1:41:35] vrsswow: Farming with full bags :) new meta
[1:41:40] whod1esnext: why have i been watching Zeroji this whole time when I could have learned these farming tricks?!
[1:42:01] gobiaz: i cant play wow since yesterday i keep disconnecting instantly
[1:42:02] Sinostra: why do you have your pvp trinket equiped for that ?
[1:42:05] Zenlyn: y'all wont be trollin when he gets world first pod in this very instance
[1:42:20] whod1esnext: xD   <3
[1:42:32] weraxa: can you use the STV mount in every other zone?
[1:43:32] lucasthebestx: did u try to farm raid trash?
[1:43:41] barracoonx: @weraxa ye
[1:44:29] Toxiferous: Zeroji did some Ulda farming the other day
[1:44:49] Toxiferous: could check his vods
[1:44:50] LHermite: DID hydra get the pendulum?
[1:45:03] Zenlyn: he sold the first one for 6k
[1:45:20] Gnilvert: Any1 knows if its worth doing BFD at 40?
[1:45:21] LHermite: dad is rich
[1:45:22] Waterwalk: lies, i've seen him sold for 9k
[1:45:28] Waterwalk: he kept 3k in teh bushes:P
[1:45:45] LHermite: laughs at all the people farming gold on p1
[1:45:49] Skry667: I think epics liek SoJ and fiery war axe can drop here
[1:46:07] Waterwalk: thing is, once i do all quests on hunters, i'll prolly end up with 7k gold and then i can farm stuff, since i only did 1 from 25>39 so far.P
[1:46:51] lucasthebestx: did u try to fam trash in raid Hydra?
[1:46:55] JavaSkrpt: Pendulum drop let's go
[1:47:14] JavaSkrpt: Must go deeper
[1:47:21] Sinostra: what is the Pendulum ?
[1:47:33] Selecktt: @Hydramist Here's the SW:Death weakaura. It assumes all players have fort and food buff, so you SHOULD never hit yourself with death if you cast it when its up. Might need a bit of tweaking for hp values. https://pastebin.com/UM31Hnsi
[1:47:46] zavoooo: the only 4.0 attackspeed wep in the game
[1:47:50] JavaSkrpt: Pendulum of Doom, 4.0 attack speed
[1:48:00] JavaSkrpt: Wrecks w/ war, could wreck really well w/ enh sham

[1:48:11] 7idus: you have better chance winning national lottery than farming for pendulum
[1:48:11] Selecktt: Nope. only players.
[1:48:18] Sinostra: ok, ty
[1:48:28] Toxiferous: inc WA mailing your 6k gold to the guy in dhat
[1:48:34] JavaSkrpt: It's pretty close, drop rate is redic
[1:48:50] shrroom: imo i think they upped the drop chance
[1:48:59] Selecktt: Huh. It SHOULDNT work for mobs. But, I guess just turn your brain on for mob hp values. It's probably considering them warirors which is why
[1:49:25] Zenlyn: oh yeah most wow npcs are just tagged as classes
[1:49:27] Zenlyn: idk why HAHA
[1:49:38] DoctaShaund: what's going on today? ulda?
[1:49:40] Toxiferous: war mage or pala
[1:50:09] Baxxtah: no, he is swift
[1:50:09] Skry667: "the swift"
[1:50:12] zavoooo: u meant to say swift
[1:50:14] Ballprint: show epic profesh crafted items
[1:50:17] Zenlyn: LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[1:50:20] Kyfoon: looooooooool
[1:50:21] Zenlyn: where'd the other 2 go
[1:50:24] vitaminabcdefgh: they dont call him the swift for nothing
[1:50:24] shrroom: "The swift"
[1:50:26] Revansoon: i wonder why
[1:50:30] Toxiferous: fastest npc I’ve ever seen
[1:50:44] Mafajazz: lool he surely living up to his name, fast boooi
[1:51:06] Skry667: almost ac cool as Alex DeLarge
[1:51:39] Mystiggo: classic Ryan coming to farm gold with bags full of junk KEKW
[1:51:49] Selecktt: Yeah I don't think theres a way to turn it off for NPCs, since NPCs also have a "class", which is what the WA checks for.

[1:55:05] aesash: there was a quest chain that gives a  14 slot bag
[1:55:07] Kaekias: no bag addon is going to help with bag space though. he just needs bigger bags
[1:55:17] Zenlyn: was that a blue ?

[1:56:35] Zenlyn: can someone be a lad and come trade ryan so he can have  clean bags
[1:56:47] DnB_Junkee: i mean chat is right. Hydra uses addons, requests addons and what not, but still likes to look through his bags like looking through a pile of hay to find a needle
[1:56:51] JukeboxHey: Hydra what is the dot tracker? pls share <3

[5:03:16] ndras: Only balance got nerf right?
[5:03:36] smaftyz: I hope they nerf spriest in pvp without nerfing pve
[5:03:52] shrroom: Make death do 100% when enemy is below 20-30% hp. If not, only do like half the dmg or something
[5:03:53] gratzitko: well there pve dmg is insane anyways lol
[5:04:14] smaftyz: @shrroom they die if you do it to targets 20-30% tho so useless
[5:04:15] gratzitko: yea i agree thats a good change

[5:05:31] roorzy: @smaftyz please no
[5:05:41] GankstaboyZ: Looking at a maxed out boomie killing under gears and basing them of that being fine is a little farfetched
[5:05:54] gratzitko: no cost, max range, highest dsmg in game, 6 second cooldown, instant cast, hehe
[5:05:56] GankstaboyZ: @fitzgeraldn You mean that one spell that hits like a wet noodle xD
[5:06:04] smaftyz: @roorzy why? why should a spec become useless in pve because its good in pvp and vice versa
[5:06:09] fitzgeraldn: @GankstaboyZ atleast you have 0 mana issues
