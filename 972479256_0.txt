[0:22:19] pipboy733: can anyone explain to me how asmongold had like 30k + viewers at once yesterday... dude is obnoxious lol. Id heard of him over the years but never watched his stream
[0:22:40] SecurityChiefOdo: personally i like his streams
[0:22:51] Kinghorn: children pipboy733
[0:22:57] SecurityChiefOdo: im 30
[0:23:01] pipboy733: he could at least clean his room... looked like a damn tornado blew thru there
[0:23:06] Kinghorn: I am sorry SecurityChiefOdo
[0:23:08] hmasleepiez: If you havent watched his stream how do you know you dont like him?
[0:23:10] pipboy733: i spent about 3 mins and had to leave lol
[0:23:30] hmasleepiez: Haha yeah hes definitely not for everyone
[0:24:14] pipboy733: it just reminded me of a giant circle jerk every time he would be a dick to someone and everyone would all cheer him on
[0:24:27] pipboy733: i mean to each his own , its clearly working lol
[0:25:11] hmasleepiez: He definitely has a persona on stream that can be annoying. His second channel on youtube is more who he really is
[0:25:18] hmasleepiez: And he seems like decent guy
[0:26:07] MetallicusGaming: He is a decent guy, but with a chat like that you kinda need to be annoying LUL
[0:26:20] SecurityChiefOdo: ever see xqcs chat
[0:26:22] MrGattz: hes actually a really smart dude and a good guy. his twitch persona is trash.
[0:27:04] Brandonhipster: Just watch him Zach streams on his other channel. He chill most of the time there
[0:27:21] hmasleepiez: Asmon also used to allow everything in his chat which made it extremely toxic
[0:27:34] SecurityChiefOdo: if youre not generating hate youre doing it wrong
[0:27:37] MrGattz: and trash tends to attract more trash. and drama attracts more drama. and then you purposefully unmoderated the attracted trash and drama and you get 30-50k viewers screaming their heads off in a chat room.
[0:28:27] Brandonhipster: I mean look at XQC chat. Much worse
[0:28:40] hmasleepiez: Very true
[0:28:47] MrGattz: its the same thing. hes a drama streamer.
