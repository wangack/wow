[4:15:23] EliBourne: In concept, Twisted Metal is a demolition derby that emphasizes the usage of ballistic projectiles, machine guns, mines, and other types of weapons (up to and including satellite-based weapons and nuclear weapons). Players choose a vehicle, and an arena—or a series of arenas in the story mode—to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The last driver alive is the winner.
[4:15:42] Facer339: i blew that thing up

[4:33:05] m1_c_h_a_e_l: @dilconia yes im in mountain got it wrong :p
[4:33:36] actually_pierce: NO WAY
[4:33:37] actually_pierce: is it?
[4:33:39] actually_pierce: SoM?
[4:33:48] actually_pierce: bring back SoM! <3
[4:33:48] Aldever13: or its a bug
[4:33:58] THUNDERTIGERDK: Som
[4:33:58] Ava52: LUL
[4:34:00] actually_pierce: why?
[4:34:02] Ava52: Tell him teagen!
[4:34:05] actually_pierce: what's wrong with SoM?
[4:34:15] nashonatorrr: there still locked
[4:34:28] actually_pierce: honestly, why the hate against SoM?
[4:34:39] Ava52: Teagen gonna be shocked, im playing alliance right now
[4:34:55] Foe009: curious, who is this talking? so angry...
[4:34:57] sparket123: the hc will def be classic
[4:35:21] actually_pierce: they already said HC will not be SoM
[4:35:21] Aldever13: HC retail... thats easy mode
[4:35:30] Teagens: @actually_pierce SoM was a POS waste of time throw together half assed by the Devs in an attempt to hold onto players while they were bleeding out employees who were leaving over the massive lawsuit and fallout due to corrupt Blizzard High Ups abusing their staff
[4:35:47] Teagens: There were no rewards for doing it
[4:35:52] Teagens: There was no prestiege TO doing it
[4:35:59] Teagens: It was literally a complete waste of time
[4:36:06] Teagens: It was a joke
[4:36:15] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[4:36:18] Toiletsmurf: It was fun to do tho...
[4:36:19] Teagens: CLASSIC WoW had value. SoM did not.
[4:36:48] actually_pierce: Wasn't SoM basically Classic but with better raid bosses and no world buffs inside raids?
[4:37:06] Teagens: @actually_pierce And it was still a POS.
[4:37:09] actually_pierce: What was more that made it bad?
[4:37:10] TheEndIsNear777: i got to lvl 47 in classic and 14 in SoM
[4:37:21] TheEndIsNear777: This time im gonna power through the leveling!
[4:37:48] Aldever13: when i log into SoM PTR it brings me to retail PTR
[4:37:59] Teagens: It was literally a waste of time and had NOTHING beneficially coming from it. It was a recast of "classic" branded as something "new" to attract players back but you were given no rewards or prestiege for doing it
[4:38:04] actually_pierce: I just wish they did Classic Fresh :(
[4:38:07] Aldever13: so it must be be a bug
