[0:58:30] wtfakakali: Do you still raid in WoW? I lost that some time when I started working. If you come home at 17 and need to study 10 Bosses for raid at 19 AND care for your food, that was just too hard for me
[0:58:44] Taylor131314: !$timeout diogenem87

[0:59:33] KaisenSiru: I remember the G'huun raid anniesCozy

[0:59:57] Thomusus: yea it was very good, you took me in with no xp I had a good time
[1:00:01] wtfakakali: Also I just lost the good feeling when killing a boss. In my youth it was wonderful, later it was more like FINALLY.
[1:00:02] Alastor7783: GA'HUUUUN
[1:00:02] Geoffku: xddICANT

[1:00:38] Mirkooo: I miss killing early mythic bosses Sadge
[1:00:41] Swiggyswoo_: I wish Lost Ark launched in its current state tho, way easier to get the minimum requirements etc, the raids are literally mindblowingly cool so it's a shame you missed out PepeHands
[1:00:46] Alastor7783: growing peepoGiggle

[1:01:41] SiraUK: The problem with streaming raiding if you're not a RFWF raider, it's frustrating to viewers because you could be doing everything correct, but your team mates let you down
[1:01:44] KaisenSiru: anniesCozy
[1:01:48] NoName6834: gatekeeping keeps me away from lost ark

[1:02:34] loppish91: and even worse cuz they are always drunk here Kappa
[1:02:37] Taylor131313: would muting discord for stream be any good on that regard?
[1:02:50] duor: yeah i feel like back in legionfuchsia days a lot of the regular voices were recognisable so it was less alienating to viewers
[1:02:50] Sharxkin: 100% agree i  always leave raid streams
[1:02:54] th3b1g5h0w: lol
[1:03:00] Collnaris: ye true, you're not good Kappa

[1:04:14] jokarajoka: Hello, I need a little help. I started streaming already 1 month ago. I received the payment on paypal but paypal wants to hold all payments for the next 21 days. There is no obligation for him to accept the sending. has that ever happened to you?
[1:04:25] jokarajoka: This is not my main chanel
[1:04:34] Thomusus: you do it to help new people I suppose or to have a laugh
[1:04:42] Collnaris: wat
[1:04:42] Thomusus: but you have better options as you say
[1:04:43] Swiggyswoo_: btw annie Enshrouded in 2 hours PauseChamp
[1:04:46] Taylor131313: I do agree that voice on stream is a turnoff though, I usually tune out whenever there's voices I don't know on any stream, I only want to hear the streamer
[1:05:11] Alastor7783: bot stream raids 5Head
[1:05:23] Alastor7783: then it's just the people on discord watching anyway YEP
[1:05:41] Collnaris: you got the mount haven't you?
[1:05:41] Taylor131313: gotta join raids a bit more often so we can gear you up though YEP
[1:05:42] Geoffku: I'm looking forward to getting carried for that PepeLaugh
[1:06:11] itsClubby: Its so wild to think I haven't got ahead of the curve since BFA; WoW really is a past thing for me now peepoSad TFT is life

[1:07:23] Morgonbladet: There will probably be a way
[1:07:57] Taylor131313: yes but it's character wide, isn't it
[1:07:58] Morgonbladet: ye
[1:08:02] Lorrdzik: I on purpose waited for AoC to be gone to get carried on Jailer just for a mount in fated season LUL
[1:08:06] Waverley_XI: Hej Annie

[1:09:09] Taylor131313: you want to boost during fated or this season?
[1:09:11] Lorrdzik: I meant the fated mount
[1:09:14] Alastor7783: solo tanking jailer was fun, ngl
[1:09:23] Just_Aizla: Are Fated raids gonna be a thing here in DF? :O
[1:09:28] Alastor7783: and we failed the last group PepeHands
[1:09:29] Collnaris: boomkin was broken af
[1:09:30] Alastor7783: I still feel bad
[1:09:34] Geoffku: I was the first one to get carried for the jailer mount EZ
[1:09:39] Thomusus: soon guilds are cross realm aswell so you could expand your empire muahahhaa xD
[1:09:44] Taylor131313: there's gonna be achievements for fated raids
[1:09:54] Taylor131313: would be cool to do that together
[1:09:56] Mirkooo: I started raiding with you guys during fated season Pog
[1:09:58] Taylor131313: there was in SL at least
[1:10:01] NoName6834: monkaGun SMOrc
[1:10:03] Lorrdzik: I think there were
[1:10:04] Collnaris: they are bringing back fated raids?
[1:10:09] KaisenSiru: There will be, there was an achievement for a Normal, Heroic, and mythic fated raid
[1:10:29] Collnaris: we checked some achi
[1:10:36] Morgonbladet: pretty sure it worked
[1:10:46] Taylor131313: was easy to check for the mount
[1:10:46] Alastor7783: which mount ? the aotc or the one for clearing all 3 fated raids ?
[1:10:52] jacksplatt: hmmmm

[1:12:58] Excal1burUK: so i picked up the game due to a friend, and they gifted me a toon boost, so im 70 already
[1:13:00] SiraUK: I've been playing for years, I just use recount (rotation checking) and DBM
[1:13:03] RalphMullin: I think "Better Fishing" is a must
[1:13:06] JurgenRapp: @Morgonbladet more interactions on parasocial media better place in queue kermitNODDERS I like it, watched the latest youtube +5, liked the latest instagram +2
[1:13:09] HecticSpaniard: auctionator maybe to make some gold
[1:13:09] LatroTLI: depends on what content you do
[1:13:10] Alastor7783: plater Hmmge

[1:13:44] Collnaris: the shit addon ye
[1:13:52] AlfredK: I like "blizzmove" so you can move around all the windows
[1:13:53] Mirkooo: And Pawn shows you item level upgrades with the stats you want, so you dont have to look up yourself what you need
[1:13:56] RalphMullin: If you are lazy like me, GSE is a must for making One-Button Macros that do your entire rotation
[1:13:58] Curatibi: Weak Auras is a must i think
[1:13:59] NotTonje: Oi it's snowing inside!
[1:14:03] justintricate: auctionator if you sell anything :)
[1:14:03] EX0stasis: "Can I Mog it?" for finding out if you have already learned an appearance already. If not, feel free to sell it, vendor it, or disenchant it. I find it helpful for while leveling.
[1:14:03] Game_Rebel: hi annie & chat
[1:14:07] Game_Rebel: peepoHey
[1:14:09] SiraUK: Not sure how much longer DBM will be useful, if blizz are planning to hide boss triggers from addons
[1:14:11] Game_Rebel: hewwo
[1:14:15] Alastor7783: is that the fridge I hear? Hmmge

[1:14:27] Just_Aizla: AllTheThings
[1:14:33] Mirkooo: Weakauras are pretty advanced too, i barely use any anniesHmm
[1:14:42] kraevyn60: Hekili is good if you are new to a class to learn rotation
[1:14:55] BattleHulk87: World Quest Tracker i find useful
[1:15:00] Just_Aizla: Hekili for class rotation
[1:15:00] Game_Rebel: I don't really customize WA, but I'll get premade ones
[1:15:07] Game_Rebel: creating your own is crazy
[1:15:11] Alastor7783: class WA so you can see your abilities & stuff
[1:15:16] Taylor131313: HEKILIKI

[1:15:25] KaisenSiru: Hekili Pog
[1:15:28] Alastor7783: super simple, even a dumbass like me got it
[1:15:30] Taylor131313: I was using it for shadow priest xdd
[1:15:30] Mirkooo: @Alastor7783 Default bars work fine tho imo
[1:15:31] Collnaris: depends what kind of content you're wanting to play in WoW, and use addons for it
[1:15:35] Morgonbladet: based
[1:15:39] justintricate: better to just learn your class than hekili tbh
[1:15:45] giodude9: cooldown timer is built in the game now right?
[1:15:49] Celc1us: I think WA is way to advanced for a new player, let them learn the basics first
[1:15:56] Excal1burUK: currently i think im an arcane mage
[1:16:00] Mirkooo: @Celc1us NODDERS
[1:16:17] EX0stasis: "Sorted." is also a fun new take on a bags addon. It's basically a spreadsheet with sortable columns that show stats at a glance.
[1:16:26] Alastor7783: @Mirkooo not really, seeing whirlwind buffs on fury or trick shots buff on MM doesn't work with default bars

[1:17:02] Taylor131313: you really need to adjust a weakaura to your liking, I feel like blinding picking someone else's weakaura never works, there's often procs and spells you don't care about tracking
[1:17:05] Alastor7783: oh, yeah
[1:17:08] kaluci1: Classicnumbers greatly improved my enjoyment
[1:17:18] Alastor7783: BattlegroundEnemies addon is super useful if you do BGs

[1:17:45] kraevyn60: Rarescanner
[1:17:48] Taylor131313: I remember getting a weakaura for augvoker and there was so much useless shit, I removed 50% of the auras LULE
[1:17:52] ruthlesskendogg: anniesHi gm guys
[1:17:52] Alastor7783: Shadowlands RBGs FeelsStrongMan great times
[1:17:52] SyrenLove441365: i started using AdiBag (when I saw you using it) instead of Bagnon or whatever it was. seemed more organized
[1:18:06] Taylor131313: alt, nothing about shadowlands was "great times"
[1:18:07] kaluci1: It shows dmg as if you play classic
[1:18:07] Alastor7783: me & infy holding farm against like 5 people basedust
[1:18:15] Alastor7783: wtf is basedust
[1:18:17] Alastor7783: Smadge

[1:35:04] FAIL0ZOFF: @ralphmullin i feel the same bro, i play classic but not because i think its the "best wow version ever" its just retail is no longer doing it for me
[1:35:10] Alastor7783: it used to Smadge
[1:35:17] Mirkooo: They changed it a few weeks ago i think, idk why
[1:35:23] archmagus1: honestly best time to play in general is at the end of the current xpac lol

[1:39:29] LifeisPepeHands: The story of DF wasn't that engrossing, got bored and dropped my sub mid S2

[2:53:31] NoName6834: SkillIssue
[2:53:44] snaeks: And the ability is a long super-speed in which turning is very limited
[2:53:45] kozm0httv: activate it only on the long straits of the race
[2:53:57] Jeanie130: only use boost on straightaway
[2:54:07] kozm0httv: theeere we go
[2:54:13] Collnaris: SPEEDERS

[3:59:43] PneumaWHU: servers for old pc games get taken down all the time
[3:59:44] Bitfrost9: number of hours played per game is very skewed too. on my steam account my top game has 1100 hours played. 2nd is 350 hours. and thats not counting the hours i put into WoW.

[4:00:53] Collnaris: i had to do that too LUL
[4:00:59] Wardrick7: i have many games on steam which would not work on my pc without downloading some community fixes
[4:01:02] eternitycrystal: yea nintendo is a really scammer company of the gaming sphere
[4:01:05] snaeks: Nintendo games never drop in price either, no matter how old they get
[4:01:05] Dean_Metal: i remember downloading steam when half-life 2 released and thought wtf is this thing...
[4:01:15] theonerune: and yet still choose the airport map

[4:06:58] bYTEfROG: are they smokers? could be cigarette gunk building up\
[4:07:06] Collnaris: like if it was in a damp dirty closet or something

[4:10:35] pebutnutter: I forget literally 5 minutes later, so I never watch any cinematics
[4:10:36] KaisenSiru: Yes, they were the primal incarnates. And Vyranoth is clutchmates with Alextrasza
[4:10:38] daggerus1: Depends on the game tbh Annie dragonflight storytelling is just bad
[4:10:44] Collnaris: look at ice dragon's baby arms xdd
[4:10:45] Smasher16323: okay but loriented is a great word choice

[4:12:16] Twigbot4k: Also mechanics and rotations and how to play games focus.  in addition to lore and stories.  :)
[4:12:18] Dean_Metal: i lost interest once shadowlands lore arrived. it was dumb
[4:12:30] avispa13: @Dean_Metal same
[4:12:35] KaisenSiru: Can't wait for Chronicles Volume 4 Pog
[4:12:38] snaeks: Yeah, SL kinda killed my lore interest
[4:12:38] Collnaris: do you tho?
[4:12:40] drago101119: @Collnaris yeah sometimes the lore can be a bit weird and non-sequitur
[4:12:53] eternitycrystal: Lore is still good, stop overreacting
[4:12:55] Twigbot4k: WoW lore I have to.. purposely not vet it much or intensely.  Alot is just.. silly.
[4:13:14] Collnaris: that sounds.......
[4:13:14] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite
[4:13:15] Alterex417: @Dean_Metal we dont talk about the lore changes that came from shadowlands =\
[4:13:21] drago101119: I want to buy the chronicles but have too many other bills to pay lol
[4:13:22] Geoffku: you can read? Pag
[4:13:26] RalphMullin: I can tell you the lore of every final fantasy game no matter how complex it is but WoW is a different ballgame. I'm not sure it's possible to fully understand WoW lore.
[4:13:36] icyplums: the way Annie says ‚Äúhave a reading stream‚Äù and we know it‚Äôll never happen anniesM
[4:13:42] Baemor: Summoning the netherdrakes to the dragon isles
[4:13:44] cpmd4: recruiting the netherdrakes to their cause
[4:13:45] capnkernow: it's the netherwring settlement stuff
[4:13:54] Hippwn: One thing I think would help these quests in DF is if they made you do them in order they came out because its pretty confusing if you do them out of order
[4:13:56] Twigbot4k: Chronicles 4 changes lore established by previous chronicles, Annie, so just get and read the latest one.  :)
[4:13:58] Qelvue: it's the netherdrakes beoing invited to settle on the dragon isles
[4:14:01] eternitycrystal: dragons?
[4:14:18] Geoffku: annie after the first page of her reading stream AnnieTakingNotes

[4:14:32] Twigbot4k: Annie, also time rifts weak aura.  So helpful for those!  It seems to be sync'ed to the superbloom event, also.  Approx.
[4:14:32] Alterex417: so this is for the people that didnt get the netherdrakes from the trading post when they were intially released
[4:14:33] capnkernow: just run round with the extra action button
[4:14:34] Collnaris: just run

[4:50:21] Aegis_2566: @AnnieFuchsia author of AdiBags is working on a new bag addon called BetterBags https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/s/HgyyOWH6V7
[4:50:24] nilleman1: nice
[4:50:25] Smartsauce: just got clayscale mount on first big dig, is it rare?
[4:50:28] Collnaris: grats on vault slot
[4:50:41] Smartsauce: oh and that fear broke cause the priest did shadow word death
[4:50:59] Drpzor: ggs were nice games ^^ albeit pretty annoying XD
[4:51:01] BisonD: yes, adi bags backend was getting unmanageable
[4:51:06] Glade_Roger: Adibags code is 15 years old and needed a rewrite. Badly.
[4:51:36] Aegis_2566: Dunno, i use ark inventory
[4:51:50] cabeshpash: what action bar mod are you using @AnnieFuchsia ?
[4:52:02] Collnaris: little nightmares 3 2024 release PauseChamp https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392860/Little_Nightmares_III/
[4:52:41] cabeshpash: I mean the add-on that shows the 6 abilities near the middle of your screen
[4:53:08] drioplays: @cabeshpash that's a weak aura
[4:53:21] cabeshpash: @drioplays thanks you
[4:53:44] LatroTLI: whats this one called?
[4:53:45] Edenstrasza: which addon bag is that?

[4:54:07] Edenstrasza: nice
[4:54:09] ipizza_man: going for mounts?
[4:54:10] Edenstrasza: downloading it now
[4:54:16] notzemy: !betterbags
[4:54:17] Edenstrasza: bagnon has been blowing up on me
[4:54:41] Meltoros: @Edenstrasza caused a number of crashes for me i think
[4:54:52] shellynna: ohh i'll have to try this. I keep getting errors with addibags blocking any action input for some reason
[4:55:12] Edenstrasza: it would prevent me from using key inputs sometimes when I'm in dungeons or raids xD
[4:55:18] Aegis_2566: Yea
[4:55:21] ipizza_man: what's your percentage now achievements?
[4:55:22] shayliss69: wait, it is it BetterBags or Adibags?
[4:55:23] shellynna: yes! so frustrating
[4:55:30] OJ_Hype: annie why do you have 1m more gold everytime I see you playing wow? Do you have a subscription to habibi.gold.play or something? SUSSY
[4:55:30] Darkuwa: @shellynna lots of addons do, it's blizz's fault not the addon
[4:55:33] bYTEfROG: end of an era
[4:55:35] Edenstrasza: @shayliss69 BB
[4:55:36] OJ_Hype: that is not a real link
[4:55:44] shayliss69: kk ty ty
[4:55:48] OJ_Hype: xddICANT
[4:55:56] Collnaris: habibi requires gold xddHaram
[4:56:06] Eloris_: On AdiBags page, you can see a link to a Discrod, it takes you to BetterBags Discord. So, at least, the original author intentionally made that transition.
[4:56:10] bYTEfROG: GoldPLZ ABDULpls

[8:37:53] samoatrakia: having faith is enough, no religion or tradition is needed
[8:37:57] lunatk67: ok stop playing wow and watch the Star Wars series
[8:38:01] ShadRX1: there are 2 kinds of religion - first was evolved into politics at some point long time ago, and the second is when people silently believe in something they want to believe but don't bother others with it

[9:02:52] nightst314: he has critics, calling all that haters is kinda meh
[9:02:56] Morgonbladet: Haters couldn't give a -vote, unlucky
[9:02:57] Taylor131313: every time I read posts about asmon they're full of hatred, guess it's not a good representation in the end LUL

[9:03:12] Ladstarr: Asmon The One True King
[9:03:28] PneumaWHU: if it's the same people up for the award every year, seems a little pointless having it
[9:03:31] Taylor131313: esfand had 18% of wow in 2023, guess he indeed is the odd one out in the end
[9:03:40] Taylor131313: didn't play a lot of MMOs this year
[9:03:48] ManiacalCarl: I voted annie for lots of things. But I knew the "asmon" effect would be strong.
[9:04:06] Aegis_2566: I nominated myself, the fact that I am not in the list is bullshit

[9:11:08] MarkFiveO: I was a bit overwhelmed with DF from the get go, but since coming back it's nice to hear that most oft he stuff isn't really necessary and for people who don't raid (which applies to me)
[9:11:26] xurnuxien: anniesKek @CHAT OFC... this song bugging me whole day... finally found it " Frantique - Strut Your Funky Stuff (12" Version)" SingsNote yeleDance

[9:14:36] Collnaris: KEKW
[9:14:36] Ladstarr: @Julez_i_o That's the reason you need to find guild that raids and doesnt leave the instance after one wipe like pubgs do
[9:14:53] Collnaris: why would you not
[9:14:54] PneumaWHU: no one has a worgen
[9:15:03] samoatrakia: @indithedog there is several unicorn mounts in game, like the the Sundancer, but they haven‚Äôt made a rainbow unicorn yet.
[9:15:05] Elerments: Also a new pair of glasses fishing in the coast now of gilnaeas
[9:15:07] Makkan780: wtf do i need to make a worgen DansGame
[9:15:29] Ladstarr: @Makkan780 no
[9:15:31] Collnaris: you'd have a worgen if you wanted the heritage armor
[9:15:32] Chryterion: My druid is a worgen
[9:15:41] Makkan780: ah fuck that

[9:15:50] Collnaris: i have a worgen druid and hunter
[9:15:59] WispGB: what class makes the most sense lore wise?
[9:16:05] eternitycrystal: it's crazy how much achievements points you have. I myself have around 38k But it only gets harder to get achievements. Could you perhaps give me some tips to push through the rest?
[9:16:07] indithedog: @samoatrakia ty <3
[9:16:07] Taylor131313: you have a level 70 boost too, if you didn't use the new expansion one yet
[9:16:10] Collnaris: druid
[9:16:10] Aegis_2566: I would assume to start the gilneas quests you need to be 70
[9:16:10] Julez_i_o: worgen rogue forsure
[9:16:20] Collnaris: worgen is a druid curse
[9:16:26] waya121: worgen rogue with transmoged claws for weapons!
[9:16:31] MarkFiveO: I loved my Worgen Druid
[9:16:39] rarid_kek: lore wise its druid but rogue also works good
[9:16:44] duor: the worgen you play as are just normal doods who got cursed though, so any human class makes sense
[9:16:52] Julez_i_o: it is a druid curse, that does make sense also
[9:16:59] indithedog: it feels weird dragonriding in northrend looking for time lost proto drake
[9:17:03] GI__Jose: anniesRIOT  Annie like
[9:17:06] samoatrakia: i had a worgen‚Ä¶ until I took skinning as a profession and saw how he did it with his bare claws.. spooky

[9:17:38] bYTEfROG: oh wait, fake news from wowhead: the comments say you get the toy automatically after a relog on other races
[9:17:41] Ladstarr: @indithedog you still hope you gonna get it? :D
[9:17:54] bYTEfROG: but only worgen can use it
[9:17:57] Redo_Died_Again: my worgen needed to be lvl 70 to see gilneas quest
[9:18:51] indithedog: def faster more efficient flying
[9:19:07] bYTEfROG: you may not need it
[9:19:09] Taylor131313: bYTEfROG: oh wait, fake news from wowhead: the comments say you get the toy automatically after a relog on other races <-

[9:19:52] Taylor131313: Annie you might not need a worgen
[9:20:03] Taylor131313: bYTEfROG: oh wait, fake news from wowhead: the comments say you get the toy automatically after a relog on other races
[9:20:22] Julez_i_o: are outland riding courses worth doing?
[9:20:26] bYTEfROG: do the quest, relog, toy should be in your toybox
[9:20:49] Collnaris: i just logged my worgen, what is toy called
[9:20:51] bYTEfROG: "Confirming I was able to earn this toy on an Orc after doing the Horde side questline. Completed Reclamation of Gilneas, relogged, and the toy was there in my toybox"
[9:21:36] bYTEfROG: @Collnaris Tess's Peacebloom
