[2:56:30] TheeCableguy: like if they keep the numbers the same than shadow priest is gonna be insane
[2:56:46] UnearthedSin: Right but if we were not throttled at 25 people would just grind by this and head to the end. Not taking time to enjoy all the changes i guess i meant

[5:50:06] Nokterian: those engineers always know how to make it better from toyota and hyundai
[5:50:12] TheeCableguy: Toyota CEO hates the idea of all EV'S
[5:50:18] WeE_wOo_WhEn: did they finish the sentence under their breath with "at 10mph" :D
[5:50:43] Piebringer619: they can hate EVS but they will take over old cars
[5:50:45] anxietyrising: It is a smaller, more efficient battery. So the car weighs less, and the batteru goes farther. Will probably pretty standard in EVs in the next 5 or so years at this rate
[5:50:46] Piebringer619: for sure
[5:50:56] TheeCableguy: Toyota would rather develop a new technology than see the world go all EV. He had an interview about it. It was actually pretty good.
[5:51:24] Piebringer619: wow that harsh on evs
[5:52:09] TheeCableguy: Yeah and a lot of people are pushing the idea that all cars should be EV's going forward. What does that do for developing countries or even a lot of places in Europe.
[5:52:16] Piebringer619: but imagine chaning oil
[5:53:13] Screamnsteam: @Piebringer619 changing oil takes like 10min lmao
