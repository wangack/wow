[0:16:08] Mystic_Bard: go the v-tuber way and be on your pajamas !!!
[0:16:16] CrowMomocle: maybe pass out in jeans
[0:16:39] CloudyHS: shadowlands is just the worst for collection content, whenever i go back to get some of the stuff i missed, its just waves of bullshit to wade thru
[0:17:04] deathbybubbles49: @CloudyHS yea it sucks
[0:17:36] CloudyHS: a perfect example of shadowlands is the secret for the shadehound mount, if you fail the puzzle youre locked out for 2 hours from trying again, like why is that a thing
[0:17:40] databob1: Besides the plague and the scandal shadowlands just needs a lore face-lift

[0:20:17] databob1: Dead game Rip
[0:20:18] RAF_Sean: "mortgage meeting"
[0:20:41] RAF_Sean: Weird that Preach, Tali and Bell were also at the same Mortgage Meeting
[0:20:45] CrowMomocle: A lot of WoW streamers have been streaming FF
[0:21:07] RAF_Sean: OOoooooo Morgage Meeting = MM. If you flip MM you get WW. War Within!
[0:21:10] RAF_Sean: Busted
[0:21:50] CrowMomocle: Need to buy 2 stair gates to keep little one safe.
[0:22:26] RAF_Sean: We have a real nice retractable gate that we use in the kitchen to keep Shadow out
[0:22:54] MachoCham: It does seem there is the different niche of Variety streamers and playing chase the rainbow
[0:22:58] RAF_Sean: Rebirth
[0:23:25] CrowMomocle: Wowgrandma can always be counted on to stream wow at night
[0:23:50] LuiBMHunter: afternoon all
[0:23:54] MachoCham: I mean that some people do genuinely do variety on what they want to play; other do variety to chase the golden egg
[0:23:54] CrowMomocle: If I streamed I'd only stream WoW
[0:23:55] shaypressplay: Morning or Good Day!
[0:23:56] Forgiven78: *Raises Hand*

[0:24:19] MediumRareOG: I don't understand why chatters get caught up on this. It's fine to chase the meta. It's fine not to. Why does it mater?
[0:24:22] deathbybubbles49: I'm a weekend lover
[0:24:28] SskygamesS: shadowlands WutFace oh god pls no LUL
[0:24:53] Ryuuza930: working and lurking at home with the flu thanks for keeping me going today
[0:25:28] ratgefingah: gday
[0:25:31] shaypressplay: FF28 on PS& on Wed bahahahahaha
[0:25:37] MediumRareOG: The only issue is if a streamer can make something entertaining, whether they're into it or not, whether it's the meta or not
[0:25:39] CrowMomocle: I loved it when SOD came out and there were loads of peeps streaming it
[0:25:40] BBMezzy: Finished your trading post yet?
[0:25:40] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:25:51] CrowMomocle: it was all new and exciting
[0:25:55] RAF_Sean: I am glad those folks find success with those new games but I like the comfort in knowing I can tuen in here (or other WoW only channels) for consistently good content I'm familiar with
[0:25:59] SskygamesS: well that is people takes 20 mins LUL
[0:26:09] Layliah79: mrgmHey Happy Friday!!!
[0:26:13] SskygamesS: dont ask me how xD
[0:26:33] SinicalDev: yo
[0:26:51] Layliah79: did u see the reply to your going live stream? mrgmNotLikeThis
[0:27:04] Layliah79: NO!
[0:27:20] Layliah79: i see those ppl everywhere
[0:27:20] MediumRareOG: twittere is such a shit hole now
[0:27:21] Arlaeya: You're not stupid! You're playing what you like how you like. It's honestly refreshing as hell to see
[0:27:23] RAF_Sean: Do you think people who stream only 1 game tend to get preferential treatment from those studios when they are looking for creators to use in events?
[0:27:27] SskygamesS: huh
[0:27:33] shaypressplay: I like that you don't stream other games, this is where I come for chill, news and the random rage nerd that wants to challenge you.
[0:27:46] CardinalTX: I think that i want to play SoD but im struggling to stay with it.....feels weird man
[0:27:47] SinicalDev: streamer brain is real on new games lmao - most people rush and dont read the tooltips properly then blame the devs. Streaming something you're familiar with gives a better experience overall imo
[0:27:56] Lausten: Sounds like I need to go on Twitter more often Kappa
[0:28:01] MachoCham: I think Preach is a perfect example of a variety streamer. It's 100% genuine
[0:28:37] Layliah79: has anyone tried Self Found mode yet?
[0:28:54] SskygamesS: supermarket simulator or riot Kappa
[0:29:03] Layliah79: same - it quietly came out w/o much hype
[0:29:28] CardinalTX: SSF seems so boring to me......wouldnt watch. its over done at this point
[0:29:28] SskygamesS: asmon for what we know will play self-found for sure Kappa
[0:29:39] MachoCham: I like how Last Epoch does self found mode and it boosts your drop chances but you obviously can never trade it
[0:29:49] Layliah79: oh wow
[0:30:17] SinicalDev: sod is dead to me until the xp boost next week
[0:30:20] SskygamesS: idk LUL
[0:31:12] RAF_Sean: I wanted to engage with the covnenant systems so badly but I just couldn't do it
[0:31:22] MediumRareOG: i haven't levelled to 40 in SoD. I feel good about waiting LULW
[0:31:28] SskygamesS: okay i have to confess torghast was my thing was super funny to do as mage doing millions of damage
[0:31:35] Layliah79: Abom Stitching for Necrolord covenant was prob my fav of the 4.
[0:32:03] Oswaldovzki: Me neither! I'm playing it now
[0:32:09] Layliah79: Ember Court was a lot of fun. I did it and maxed everything on all 4 armor types. Weekly lockout back then was the only downfall.
[0:32:16] MediumRareOG: so path of ascension is made easier by being level 70?
[0:32:35] LuiBMHunter: To the Maw!
[0:32:39] Jeanssi: when you did PoA once, doing it with another armor type was only like 4h. compared to other covenants that took ages
[0:32:41] Layliah79: There were some OP strats for POA back when I did it.
[0:33:01] nightglaivez: whats best way to farm anima?
[0:33:08] Layliah79: now YES lol
[0:33:18] Layliah79: Anima - Z Mortis!!
[0:33:19] MediumRareOG: ZM is the best way to farm anima
[0:33:37] Roflrobbie: Hey all. Today is my pet crab's birthday. Her name is Pinchers! Today, is a great day to SHELL-ebrate! Happy Friday Dan and Fam!

[0:33:46] MediumRareOG: you get 1000 anima for just stepping foot into ZM
[0:33:57] Layliah79: I'm def in a minority but I enjoyed SL for collections & casual content.
[0:34:13] SskygamesS: i wanna see you finishing zereth mortis LUL people says takes a  lot of time to get everthing
[0:34:22] Roflrobbie: mrgmDab mrgmDab mrgmDab

[0:34:40] MediumRareOG: i still need to farm genesis motes /sigh
[0:35:01] SskygamesS: catJAM chat jam with me catJAM

[0:35:43] Roflrobbie: mrgmDance mrgmDance mrgmDance
[0:35:53] Layliah79: would be cool if u go to the Maw now you can randomly find Sylvanas collecting souls.

[0:36:24] Layliah79: DMF buff coming Sunday! don't forget
[0:36:24] NeeK_23: yeah a couple of weeks
[0:36:42] MediumRareOG: there's a weekly to spend 1000 stygia on 1000 venari rep. i did that
[0:36:48] NeeK_23: oh well not to bad, I think just a couple of weeklies
[0:37:03] Lausten: Its 800 not 1k
[0:37:03] Layliah79: Maw was it's worse at the beginning of SL with the EYE lol
[0:37:18] MediumRareOG: maybe it's only 800. it's been awhile. i forget
[0:37:31] MediumRareOG: i did venari paragon chests on 2 toons for the mount. that sucked
[0:37:32] NeeK_23: remember when Worgen was bis because they could mount up?
[0:37:38] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:37:58] ratgefingah: I hated worgen in the early maw time
[0:38:00] Layliah79: Keep an eye out for the Covenant events in the Maw (can't remember their names)
[0:38:05] Layliah79: lots of achievements and all
[0:38:16] ratgefingah: those fuckers ran infront of me just to spite me
[0:38:17] SinicalDev: it shouldve been an FFA PVP zone for pvp realms to add to the horror aspect
[0:38:19] Layliah79: yes!
[0:38:29] Layliah79: some of the achievements take multiple spawns of the event
[0:38:49] Layliah79: they were fun tho.
[0:38:53] NeeK_23: there's one weekly needed for an achievement which didnt come on rotation for several months, it was infuriating
[0:39:07] Layliah79: @NeeK_23 YES! i remember that!
[0:39:17] MachoCham: Diggin holes and collectin souls
[0:39:31] MediumRareOG: i still haven't got the hand mount from the maw. it sucks to get
[0:39:37] NeeK_23: the NF one, i think called Krpleleler' army or something
[0:39:44] Layliah79: secret hand mount? @MediumRareOG
[0:40:06] ratgefingah: I did my first tormenters of thorgast event last id and got the mount from the cacje the first time
[0:40:10] MediumRareOG: @Layliah79 Yeah. I think i have 2 or 3 of the rings
[0:40:11] Layliah79: hand mounts are super cool even now.
[0:40:26] Layliah79: i might have the item to spawn that rare for one of the rings but i'm NA :(
[0:40:27] MachoCham: I need the other one collecting the green orbs or whatever it was, not the ring one got that one
[0:40:37] Jeanssi: hand of nilganihmaht was the ring mount, golden hand
[0:40:40] SskygamesS: i still dont get it why some mounts from old expansions cost 72k gold or 35k+ gold they could make it more cheaper no? like 10k
[0:40:49] MachoCham: Gold sinks
[0:40:57] ratgefingah: remember the bfa frogs
[0:41:05] ratgefingah: 3 for 333.333 k
[0:41:11] NeeK_23: WoD inflation was crazy
[0:41:23] MediumRareOG: BFA has a 500k mount from mechagon, 3 333k mounts from the 3 base zones
[0:41:30] SskygamesS: same for mount on valdrakken 1.2million LUL
[0:41:38] Layliah79: frog mounts! 333k
[0:41:45] Jeanssi: yeah that was 500k too
[0:42:00] MediumRareOG: Yep, i don't have any of those mounts. I spent 2 million gold on the spider
[0:42:08] NeeK_23: I have all those mounts, I must have spent over 15m on mounts minimum
[0:42:18] ellenara35: and the long boi
[0:42:26] MachoCham: Neek needs to teach me his gold making methods
[0:42:37] SinicalDev: look in character stats tab
[0:42:39] NeeK_23: you can check on the achievements tab
[0:42:43] MachoCham: And if you say run world quests on alts I swear to god
[0:42:44] Layliah79: i have 5m now and considering if i should buy the new gold sink items
[0:43:00] Layliah79: 1.3M
[0:43:03] NeeK_23: @MachoCham it just works
[0:43:10] Jeanssi: bfa also had 500k direhorn from the longboi vendor

[0:50:00] SinicalDev: it makes me feel old sometimes how many people are still about, i used to watch sodapoppin on xfire when i was like 12 years old

[0:51:11] Jack_the_Dipper: yarrBongos

[0:59:09] SinicalDev: TGS Podcast was my favourite one back in the day
[0:59:45] SinicalDev: I feel like there isn't many wow podcasts anymore, WoW Insider was great, and All Things Azeroth
[1:00:13] Layliah79: i watched your content for many years before coming to twitch.
[1:00:43] Layliah79: yeah there are lol
[1:01:05] Silverwards: i miss Legendary, that was my go to WoW podcast pre-Warlords
[1:01:32] SinicalDev: most of the ones ive found are quite sporadic in their posting, i listen to countdown to classic sometimes but i want a modern/all wow one
[1:02:04] Oswaldovzki: Obviouslobviously
[1:02:06] Silverwards: yeah their's is weekly i think
[1:02:09] MediumRareOG: The biggest new streamers and podcasters have all come from tiktok
[1:02:16] Layliah79: Titanforge WoW Podcast and The PoddyC are two of my fav wow podcasts.
[1:02:49] Silverwards: ThePoddyC is an awful name, but it suits Max perfectly
[1:02:56] MediumRareOG: Like Kai Cenat came from Tiktok. In like 2 years went from nothing to having Nicki Minaj on stream
[1:03:08] Lausten: Theres a ton, thats where that Kowi Achievment Filter shines
[1:03:20] SskygamesS: go to the kyrian sanctum and check on att there

[1:05:34] nightglaivez: first time you gotta die
[1:05:35] nightglaivez: jump off
[1:06:09] nightglaivez: to make that count you need to kill him on the final stage of the boss
[1:06:12] nightglaivez: it has 4 tiers
[1:06:57] SskygamesS: better to just search it
[1:07:19] dright424: you get crafts and quests that you need to do to unlock things
[1:07:19] thunduz: thunduz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Kyrian should have been made playable
[1:07:23] nightglaivez: you also need to craft some stuff to unlock qeustline for other bosses..
[1:07:28] Layliah79: think u have to go thru them all individually before unlocking 2nd tier on them all
[1:07:45] SskygamesS: type the name of achievement on wowhead
[1:07:46] MuuskeWoW: you can do the higher tiers after upgrading them in the sanctum
[1:07:51] natch_looney: Are you going crazy? Yes, you're playing shadowlands, insanity is a pre-req
[1:08:07] comrade_raptor: man, seeing this shadowlands stuff again makes it feel like im looking at something from a bad dream lmfao
[1:08:10] Layliah79: https://www.wowhead.com/guide/kyrian-covenant-path-of-ascension
[1:08:13] Layliah79: i used that!
[1:08:15] Layliah79: when i did it
[1:08:43] comrade_raptor: shadowlands wouldve been an amazing expansion if they let us be part of all the covenants and i will stand by that
[1:08:51] Layliah79: look in the guide
[1:08:52] Layliah79: tells u
[1:09:05] thunduz: gotta go have breakfast with the fam but wanted to pop in and say howdy

[1:18:21] comrade_raptor: its really good
[1:18:29] CardinalTX: I liked it
[1:18:29] wastedxtime93: The first one was miserably boring imo
[1:18:32] Lausten: I stopped halway through the first Dune.. Sooo boring imo..
[1:18:45] Etaranel: It's on Disney+
[1:18:46] comrade_raptor: whaaat ar you guys for real
[1:19:02] jasonmcnuggies: @wastedxtime93 i knew nothing of Dune going in, and i came out knowing just as little
[1:19:06] CardinalTX: it is......i didnt think it was boring
[1:19:07] exWan: i really liked it.
[1:19:13] wastedxtime93: Literally nothing exciting happened during the almost 3 hours
[1:19:25] comrade_raptor: dune is a sci fi political drama
[1:19:28] CrowMomocle: I enjoyed the Dune film but obviously the book is infinitely superior.
[1:19:31] comrade_raptor: maybe people thought itd be an action movie
[1:19:32] Layliah79: Watched Aquaman 2 last night on Max. I enjoyed it.
[1:19:47] SskygamesS: spoliers LUL
[1:20:01] cyborgbear11: I thought the first one was great, I’d say it’s equivalent to lotr or Star Wars storytelling so maybe not for everyone, a lot of world building
[1:20:12] Big_Rum: Oppenheimer is a bit of a snoozer.. its three hours and heavy dialog..Im not saying its a bad movie just a bit long
[1:20:13] projektremi: when do we think season 4 dragonflight ?

[1:35:07] Lothawia: i feel like they only called it Peafowl as they dont want it as peacock in it they censor alot of stuff now lol
[1:35:10] Dokeefe1986: Hi
[1:35:35] MogSnap: thats the gender neutral term

[1:35:45] MogSnap: peacock, peahen, peafowl
[1:35:45] DevoidX: yes. peacock is a male peafowl
[1:35:46] Harai_Ulfsark: peafowl is a term yes, idk what's the difference for some people using one or the other
[1:35:51] CardinalTX: ha
[1:36:02] stat15t1c: Peahens are the females.
[1:36:08] Lausten: Just like chickens
[1:36:09] Lothawia: i had no idea LUL
[1:36:10] CardinalTX: gender neutral   lolz

[1:36:48] MediumRareOG: also, peacocks... taste like chicken
[1:36:53] stat15t1c: They looks very different, so the females are rarely mentioned.
[1:36:56] Harai_Ulfsark: also only heard peacock my entire life
[1:37:04] MogSnap: i only know this because i live right next to a zoo that has a lot of them
[1:37:05] DevoidX: peahen dont have the brightly coloured feathers that peacocks are famous for
[1:37:12] Harai_Ulfsark: except when i played planet zoo as its called peafowl over there too

[1:54:09] MediumRareOG: based on history, asmon will log in once, try and break it by getting to locked out areas, get kicked out by a gm then never play it again
[1:54:17] NeeK_23: I cant remember if I had alpha or beta for DF, think it was beta most likely
[1:54:21] Thoreya: ive gotten into the past 2 betas, hopefully i get alpha this time :)
[1:54:25] demololtv: sup dan
[1:54:34] Vedney: I'm doing one go at SF

[1:54:58] MediumRareOG: you're not wrong
[1:55:11] Thoreya: i played the shit out of DF beta, SL beta..not so much

[1:56:20] NeeK_23: i'll be happy to wait for prepatch
[1:56:22] Harai_Ulfsark: that's a lesson i learned through your streams so i dont even try to sign for betas anymore, the only beta i enjoyed thoroughly was diablo IV
[1:56:37] Thoreya: them having m+ available for like 4 days a week during DF beta was super fun
[1:57:13] eyesoftheserpent: Tbh the wotlk classic mount he was trying to get the by mistake he gotten wen-lo water tiger mount
[1:57:26] death_cam_: i just think they make raids too hard for non world first race raiders now
[1:57:27] Mystic_Bard: huh ?
[1:57:28] Thoreya: cool take, people dont raid anymore, move on
[1:57:31] Lausten: Hours?
[1:57:38] Lausten: More like 1.5 hour
[1:57:40] Mystic_Bard: so get's carried on +20s ?
[1:57:48] Sinrath: good take, raid is bad make m+ also bad
[1:57:49] death_cam_: like how long was world first heroic raid clears pre mop
[1:57:55] Thoreya: she prob got carried too
[1:57:58] Harai_Ulfsark: that's a take that been surging now, how mythic+ is more rewarding than raiding
[1:58:00] MediumRareOG: I'll take "Things that don't matter for $800", Alex
[1:58:29] Thoreya: if shes pugging 20s and not knowing how to play, something tells me shes not getting much gear
[1:58:33] NeeK_23: you dont just do a 20 without being very very good or carried
[1:58:52] Harai_Ulfsark: i can only pug raids, so unless I overgear the content by a lot im not getting an invite, so there's that
[1:58:56] NeeK_23: you prog over weeks and learn over time
[1:58:56] Thoreya: oh
[1:58:57] Thoreya: well
[1:58:59] Thoreya: there u go
[1:59:19] Harai_Ulfsark: oh shit take then
[1:59:27] eyesoftheserpent: Tbh i dont really do mythic plus tbh i have full conquest gear on my BM hunter
[1:59:33] NeeK_23: Nate carrying then, sure, your gonna be out of your depth, but thats not a system issue
[1:59:35] CardinalTX: its like saying money doesnt matter when you have a lot of it
[1:59:39] Lothawia: id like to see her take on m+ and raids at the start of an xpac/season
[1:59:41] snagprophet: I just pug 15s then quit
[1:59:52] Bware2: but... she should look at how many people actually clear 20s... its surprisingly small amount isnt it?
[2:00:15] FrostBeered: who are you talking about?
[2:00:30] Harai_Ulfsark: @Bware2 the amount of people that even get to 15s is already really small
[2:00:34] exWan: 20's are easy at this time in the expension
[2:00:49] ImperfectDark: I've never done a current raid. I don't have the confidence. I'm the "i'll do it when it's soloable" guy
[2:00:49] Vedney: M+ did definitely kill raid gearing
[2:00:59] Vedney: even in early in the season
[2:01:13] NeeK_23: hours to clear heroic. my guild isnt special but we full clear in 3 hours
[2:01:20] MediumRareOG: they need to get rid of grateful offerings
[2:01:39] dright424: I do think raiding either needs to be easier or needs some kind of special rewards to incentivize it.
[2:01:48] DeadSeriousTV: Feel like it completely ignores the problem of participation dampen the reward and the number of players will aswell which is not what M+ needs
[2:01:58] Bware2: and also - many bis pieces are from the raid not the m+ loot table.. maybe not many but some
[2:02:07] Lothawia: i forgot how bright this zone is
[2:02:07] Harai_Ulfsark: @dright424 it already have, aotc mounts
[2:02:09] eyesoftheserpent: Oh btw thare is an addon remove those errors
[2:02:11] NeeK_23: @ImperfectDark join the Dojo and clear the raid when its current. Its worth experiencing
[2:02:14] dright424: Specifically Heroic raiding feels like it lacks rewards, since you can probably do +20s if you can clear heroic raids
[2:02:32] eyesoftheserpent: Oh ok
[2:02:32] Vedney: There's generally little reason to raid if all you care about is ilvl
[2:02:42] MediumRareOG: Mythic raiding vs M+ gearing is an issue that affects like 2000 people. Nobody should care
[2:02:43] stat15t1c: Does path of ascension scale with gear now?
[2:02:45] Bware2: I dont mind the current system really and I only raid Heroic and clear 4 20s each week for 2 m+ vaults
[2:03:01] Vedney: wait, it scales
[2:03:04] dright424: @Harai_Ulfsark but thats like one or two raids per expansion
[2:03:08] Lausten: @stat15t1c Level even, at 70 its piss easy
[2:03:18] ImperfectDark: one of the path of ascension bosses booped me over the edge. Did not expect that lol
[2:03:36] Big_Rum: I think at least some crafted gear should be bis across all classes. For an example 2 pieces of ret pali bis are crafted but no crafted gear is bis for warrior Prot Tank.

[2:04:03] NeeK_23: does ATT track [To the Moon} achievement its a secret kyrian PoA one
[2:04:22] Jeanssi: it does
[2:04:25] death_cam_: @Big_Rum crafted weapons from BS normally covered that except this tier bc legendary and the proc weaps ofc
[2:04:39] Jeanssi: u need to unlock the 2nd to last encounter first
[2:05:10] Big_Rum: Dan thoughts?
[2:05:14] Vedney: what are your professsions
[2:05:17] MediumRareOG: the wormhole toy made this so much less miserable
[2:05:22] Big_Rum: I think at least some crafted gear should be bis across all classes. For an example 2 pieces of ret pali bis are crafted but no crafted gear is bis for warrior Prot Tank.
[2:05:38] Thoreya: i wish they never did the crafting system
[2:05:40] Thoreya: thats my hot take
[2:05:49] Big_Rum: Proffesions needs to matter
[2:05:52] Vedney: do warriors just not wear embelishments?
[2:06:06] Jeanssi: they do matter a lot rn

[2:06:32] Harai_Ulfsark: i like the crafting system, i have all crafters maxed out, however i havent crafted anything for my own characters Wowee
[2:06:43] Mystic_Bard: true
[2:06:43] MachoCham: Crafting orders shouldn't be server bound either
[2:06:48] death_cam_: make private orders cross realm too
[2:06:55] Lothawia: just give us back gear currency and gear vendors let me buy what i want
[2:07:11] Lothawia: Yeah
[2:07:22] Harai_Ulfsark: idk it gave me a sense of immersion the other day when someone was specifically looking for me on trade chat to craft something
[2:07:42] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:07:44] MediumRareOG: i hate seasonal gear upgrade currencies
[2:08:08] Vedney: I cant wait to get all the covenant mogs once we get warbands.
[2:08:11] Jeanssi: yup
[2:08:33] Vedney: Sabiel
[2:08:41] Jeanssi: think any of these can drop the dog mount
[2:08:45] Vedney: she's not one of them
[2:08:57] v3sur: gotta be necrolord, take a daily, then kill them to spawn her
[2:08:59] NeeK_23: took me over 300 attempts to get that mount
[2:09:07] Lothawia: Im still farming the Necrolord plate set "Unity" i only got 2 parts of it and it sucks to farm it as you can only get it from WQs
[2:09:33] Vedney: necro
[2:09:38] Lausten: @Lothawia Join the Unity Discord
[2:09:56] Vedney: you need a certain abom with you when you do WQs
[2:10:00] Jeanssi: @Vedney you can buy that Sabriel mount for 5k anima, i'd rather do that
[2:10:11] Harai_Ulfsark: i completed the unity plate set back when it was current... now for 3 other armor types :(
[2:10:23] Lothawia: @Lausten Oh?
[2:10:46] Jeanssi: @Jeanssi ok it was 5k anima and 100 offerings, forhot those
[2:11:24] death_cam_: yes
[2:11:26] Layliah79: yes
[2:11:30] Saltycaptcha: nope its a piece of sh
[2:11:32] NeeK_23: offering were a mistake. needless gating for cosmentic
[2:11:32] Jeanssi: upgrade anima conductor and you get a lot
[2:11:36] Layliah79: farm them doing all the daily stuff on all 4 covenants!
[2:11:48] death_cam_: if your maxed out abom factory with necrolord you can convert anima to offerings aswell
[2:12:01] death_cam_: you can check comment on wowhead about it
[2:12:05] Harai_Ulfsark: add grateful offerings on venture missions
[2:12:21] MediumRareOG: someone defend this to asmon once and he instantly replied "why? are people getting cosmetics too fast?"
[2:12:28] Jeanssi: but ofc even then u need to do content
[2:12:37] Jeanssi: just upgrading doesn't do anything
[2:12:44] Ace_Trekkie: @Lothawia there is also an ingame community called "Maldraxian Unity set Announcer" where people let others know which WQ is dropping a piece
[2:12:44] Layliah79: think it's the 4th comment down - https://www.wowhead.com/currency=1885/grateful-offering#comments
[2:12:49] Saltycaptcha: the mechanics of how to collect covenant armors are awful, even if you maxed a covenant and have all currencies you cant learn other armors
[2:12:55] MediumRareOG: @Harai_Ulfsark No, just get rid of grateful offerings
[2:13:19] death_cam_: @Saltycaptcha yes i agree with this ^^
[2:13:32] Lothawia: @Ace_Trekkie Thanks i had no idea this was a thing

[2:13:44] Vedney: That's why I want my warbands
[2:14:11] MediumRareOG: "meaningful choices"
[2:15:35] stat15t1c: And you get to do it three more times if you want the other armor types! Joy
[2:15:43] Lausten: Gather a bunch of souls
[2:16:00] Harai_Ulfsark: that bad boy farmed so much gold for me back in the day
[2:16:10] Vedney: did you finish torghast
[2:16:34] Lausten: Just running the stones and such just outside Vanari is the fastest, but since you still need things in Torghast you may as well do that
[2:16:40] Saltycaptcha: Hey @MrGM an small tip for the community: If you are farming something and feel like hit a wall, the wall seems to be artificial, try again after reset and you will get it in no time. Coming from a 42k achi 95% overall completion person
[2:16:51] str4ysheep: the first three are your soulbinds. after that they are in level order
[2:16:54] MediumRareOG: i need to finish the tower knowledge and do a bunch of annoying achievements
[2:17:22] MachoCham: Reset also applies to your IRL Luck
[2:17:30] Saltycaptcha: Example: if you farm dragonriding scrolls and they stop dropping, try after reset. it works with everything
[2:17:31] xmalthael02: next week
[2:17:32] MediumRareOG: comp stomp is next week
[2:17:52] MediumRareOG: i'm doing the comp stomp weekly on 82 toons
[2:18:07] NeeK_23: i do remember logging in at 4am after a daily reset to farm a mount and it spawned right in from of me. Frightend Kodo in BFA
[2:18:18] Ace_Trekkie: @Lothawia Np , it helps speed things up for sure.
[2:18:18] DeadSeriousTV: The mog for that event look sick
[2:18:21] DeadSeriousTV: cool hat
[2:18:29] death_cam_: would of been really happy if they did a exp buff with the HS event like the diablo 4 event :(
[2:18:52] Saltycaptcha: idk at least thats how I'been able to collect almost everything. and this one is an old account
[2:18:54] DeadSeriousTV: Disc and fiery horse
[2:19:06] NeeK_23: I capped the Archivest Rep this week, but still cant afford all the mogs. CBA doing more digs for the currency
[2:19:07] Lothawia: I remember logging in for the Voidtalon only to see the portal vanish right infront of me as someone just took it
[2:19:21] adampanerabread: I'm so upset at myself. I would've had a 16min monthly trading post completion but i completely forgot that dawn of the infinite didn't give flightstones
[2:19:53] death_cam_: @adampanerabread how lol
[2:20:04] NeeK_23: is speedrunning trading post the new meta? lullokanbier
[2:20:31] adampanerabread: i needed to turn in my last 7 quests or get 30 flightstones. so i took the option of killing the first boss in doti for it
[2:20:36] Bware2: @NeeK_23 yes haha. .. i was slow this month. took me 45 min
[2:20:38] MediumRareOG: @NeeK_23 i don't even think about trading post activities. it'll just happen
[2:20:38] adampanerabread: didnt drop any in heroic, went to mythic. didnt drop any
[2:21:20] heavenfall91: hello !
[2:21:22] adampanerabread: yeah, i completely forgot that they removed the flightstones
[2:21:26] death_cam_: it gave like 50 flightstones every kill in the non season week before s3
[2:21:30] death_cam_: then they nerfed it
[2:21:31] adampanerabread: it was like almost 500 per run
[2:21:42] havoom01: haha
[2:21:46] LuiBMHunter: gasp!

[2:24:44] MachoCham: So you're saying it won't come during it?

[2:28:54] Lausten: They see me rolling
[2:28:57] Lothawia: i feel like the panda thing might be MoP CMs coming back and SoO raid
[2:29:31] MachoCham: I always assumed it would be ToT for Pandaria
[2:29:38] Lothawia: Not TW tho just scaled to 70
[2:30:09] MachoCham: Yes but why would you
[2:31:01] Bware2: doing this during shadowlands as a demo warlock relied so much on getting powers for my felguard
[2:32:05] Vedney: I would try it
[2:32:59] MachoCham: Torghast was fine, it was the mandatory and being linked to player that wasn't
[2:33:13] Vedney: I really like Totem causes Bloodlust
[2:33:18] NeeK_23: evoker one is kinda basic as expected

[2:35:41] NeeK_23: totally should had added a secret feat of strength for killing him
[2:36:12] SskygamesS: oh god you are missing a lot of torghast LUL im only missing phastasma 250k

[2:50:08] ImperfectDark: i think they're always the best hunter spec Kappa
[2:50:18] AdamShwaginz: ah Torghast my favorite place (not ironic)
[2:50:33] NeeK_23: best hunter spec is demonhunter, which is just a stolen warlock spec, therefore warlocks are the best hunters
[2:51:01] AdamShwaginz: I’m still waiting for them to add more rewards to it
[2:51:18] AdamShwaginz: lol true
[2:51:21] RaestOz: any idea on what 10.2.6 is bringing?
[2:51:34] death_cam_: there are so many mog drops from it
[2:51:49] TheDeadAmine: they should make harder
[2:51:53] AdamShwaginz: and I’m so glad about that

[2:53:05] Iwony: got a few of my chars that have the skip but soloing Eonar on my other chars is just meh... really
[2:53:23] AdamShwaginz: that would suck
[2:53:24] death_cam_: wonder if they will just drop the patch without any bluepost the day before etc
[2:53:26] RaestOz: they were pretty tight lipped on SOD Phase 2 as well so maybe taking a page from that playbook

[2:56:28] mikael_jansson90: mine is BfA :) miss that expansion
[2:56:39] exWan: i really liked BFA, it was my first time raiding and im a huge pvp-er

[3:25:21] MachoCham: And it was notoriously a loss
[3:25:21] Sparklefartz: idk how many more actual cons they will have but theres tournaments tied to it so there will be something

It's expected to be held this year from November 1, 2024 – November 2, 2024 and promises to be a very unique experience as Microsoft has now taken over the reigns at Blizzard.
[3:27:46] chelfx: GeForce Now is free with paid subs
[3:27:54] Sparklefartz: do you think WoW will go Free at anypoint? lol
[3:28:14] MachoCham: I really hope it doesn't have you seen the state of PTR chat

[3:28:41] NeeK_23: AI written article
[3:28:41] Elrathir: Is this made up? like Wales?
[3:28:44] ImperfectDark: probably written by bots lol
[3:28:55] Sparklefartz: way too white
[3:29:23] MachoCham: I love the bullet point that says it's not officially announced and then goes on to say all about the event
[3:29:43] dastago: no shot watching this is making me a bit nostalgical for shadowlands
[3:30:01] HuntingElk: It's not going to get better with AI , don't know if it's true or not...
[3:30:08] NeeK_23: im gonna go do a torghast in a min
[3:30:09] Sparklefartz: shadowlands had better game balance but DF is better because you dont need to grind BS just to play the game
[3:30:15] Sparklefartz: DF game balance is laughable
[3:30:17] Elrathir: I have too tendies for the stuff I want from the trading post. Life is pain.

[3:58:30] BBMezzy: The achievements for the hardest difficulty where a ballache back then
[3:58:35] Mystikora: oow yea , hope that goes well!
[3:58:42] MediumRareOG: I did path of ascension once when it was current. it was too annoying/hard and a mini-game so i gave up. i might do it now that level 70 makes it easier
[3:58:47] chelfx: you going to the wonka experience
[3:58:53] Mystikora: its easy now, after they nerfed it a little while ago
[3:59:04] Mystikora: like i said earlier, i did all of it within the hour
[3:59:55] MediumRareOG: souls?
[4:00:03] HuntingElk: @chelfx I think I saw on the news that this was a scam, just didnt see where they were
[4:00:16] MediumRareOG: oh, i'd forgotten about that
[4:00:19] Mystikora: the gather 20 souls etc to upgrade tiers in the covenant @MediumRareOG
[4:00:20] HuntingElk: saw that it was a big scam on news
[4:00:39] HuntingElk: check it out before you go
[4:01:00] MediumRareOG: i did like 600 callings to get the necroray egg mounts so i have basically infinite souls
[4:01:34] MediumRareOG: no but i'd do the maw callings because they doubled/tripled up nicely
[4:01:57] Mystikora: lol it means you HAVE to buy it ;)
[4:02:29] chelfx: Just ask the blizzard president for it
[4:02:35] Lothawia: Twilight pack will be on the trading post anyway it tells you when you go to buy it
[4:02:46] Elrathir: wise move tbh

[4:04:09] MediumRareOG: i like that 800 tender outfit but didn't want to spend on it yet so i saved it
[4:04:31] Lothawia: worgen warrior DansGame
[4:05:11] death_cam_: really want all the nice shoulder / cape / cloak mogs you see for 50 tenders but i worry like 1-2 mounts appear in tp the following month

[4:07:58] death_cam_: 10k for each tendie
[4:08:02] chelfx: They will sell items on TP on the store before tendies imo
[4:08:05] Jeanssi: for that u don't need a mirror iirc
[4:08:11] Lothawia: i feel like they need to remove the 1k cap so we can do the other stuff to earn more each month
[4:08:23] ImperfectDark: the final boss has the dauntless mount once you unlock him
[4:08:56] Mystikora: yep . ooonly you ;)

[4:24:48] Big_Rum: How about the opening of shadowlands whenyou started in the maw and had to do the 45 minute startingarea on all your alts... PAINFULLL
[4:25:09] primejusticegaming: they shoulda just had the maw be like an ever green game play style that you can test new gear, items, specs, etc. and only give cosmetic items or collectable things
[4:25:11] Iwony: I just did my last assault to finish the ring finger mount

[4:39:06] ramzie0: They did a covenant hearthstone. It just doesnt' take you back to  your covenant
[4:39:12] manoomu: they should have at least let the  portal you unlock in your covenant be two-way
[4:39:17] Jeanssi: for this I rotated alts, so hs at sanctum and wormhole back to maw
[4:39:21] MediumRareOG: honestly i'd ditch skinning for engineering. it's too useful and time-saving
