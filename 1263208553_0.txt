[2:56:50] Korupcija_: they didn't show new affix yet :(
[2:57:19] smokingcactus: but the question is do they want the RWF people to have 2 leggos? or are they going to make them wait for like week 2 of mythic to get it?
[2:57:19] Orthobullet: Dont think they will retest tho
[2:57:20] Alrielda: so there is no rush this time?

[2:58:46] ijuki: @Painfree75 Yes... lots of it, 10.5 years of information :P
[2:58:49] twinkieruler95: then they will announce the release date
[2:58:50] Korupcija_: I member when we got a raid every 6 months..
[2:59:05] dracullus: at least this time they have room for delay, usually they rush patch before end of quarter

[3:27:24] idenkaz_: i mean other studios already said that working with UE5 is much faster.

[6:12:25] Breakthecause: @DesorDeloford I don't think you can overtake unless you are ahead multiple years. FFXIV is just a fad right now.

[6:15:08] Breakthecause: @DesorDeloford I mean, I agree that Shadowlands is not that great of an expansion, but I wouldn't in my right mind ever touch a JRPG because I don't like JRPGs. I don't like their stories and I don't like the gameplay. Until I see WoW dead, I won't ever say it's being overtaken by Square "NFT" Enix

[6:15:48] DesorDeloford: @DesorDeloford Ah got it so in denial. Okay. First it's not a JRPG; it's an MMO with an actual story. It still plays like and is treated like an MMO. Can throw in the NFT's; I don't play World of Sexual Harass my employees (see how dumb that is)

[8:55:57] SophisticSteve: SophisticSteve subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[8:56:43] MixelPlx: This raid looks pretty dope
[8:56:56] SophisticSteve: it really does
[8:56:59] Dinkyfrost: a true gate keeper
[8:57:06] TheUnknowing: boss is ball boi
[8:57:12] TiredCarcass: really nice
[8:57:16] SophisticSteve: just another boss in the wall
[8:57:25] xEskii: wow raids are always good, its the rest of the game they need to work on
[8:57:28] Dinkyfrost: a true gate keeper as teh boss is teh gate :P
[8:57:41] layercake2004: Loving this -- has a feel of the Bruce Willis movie Fifth Element.
[8:58:36] layercake2004: shoot first ask later
[8:58:44] dalvynthedrunk: Anyone expecting Sepulcher to not be good is big dum, even the worst WoW raids are better than most other mmo raids lol
[8:59:11] Try_Nothing: Is this a raid where every boss fight everyone runs to the covenant homes to change for the bosses?
[8:59:20] dalvynthedrunk: Yeah because most people just hate Deathwing, rest of DS is fine enough
[8:59:34] dalvynthedrunk: Wildstar! Oh wait.
[8:59:42] MixelPlx: Poor wildstar mixelFEELSBAD
[8:59:48] dalvynthedrunk: RIFT
[9:00:01] viraal2784: hellgate
[9:00:05] M2thew: they should pick-up wildstar again
[9:00:14] dalvynthedrunk: RIFT is behind FFXIV, which was behind Wildstar, which was behind WoW, ez true list objectively my opinion is fact
[9:00:20] Sincline387: when it came out Rift's communal event style made it amazing....it just never improved
[9:00:44] dalvynthedrunk: Gw2 raids were good as well but are neglected in favor of FF style trials now
[9:01:39] ZakuzaGB: can you imagine if wildstar was alive during the Blizz/wow issues you think many would have flocked to that game for a month haha

[9:02:20] MixelPlx: @ZakuzaGB 100%
[9:02:30] layercake2004: At the end of the day wow will be the mmo that just keeps going.. For better or worse its the most established by a mile.
[9:03:07] dalvynthedrunk: Basically the top 4 mmos...WoW, FF, ESO, Gw2. Are all safe for yearss
[9:03:32] ZakuzaGB: FF is more about the bosses themselves
[9:03:34] dalvynthedrunk: Yeah thats true. Even RIFTs last maintenance mode raid was pretty cool afaik
[9:03:49] luckfore: which raid isnt about bosses? lol

[9:03:52] ZakuzaGB: yeah i mean visually FF bosses look epic
[9:03:54] layercake2004: Questions out on New World but hey anything is possible .. Lets just see what they do in the coming months..
[9:04:06] xEskii: i hope the Riot mmo comes out and is a breath of fresh air for years to come, and raises the level of others
[9:04:32] darkh79: I never raided in rift, but from watching streams way back it always seemed like the most "wow-like" raiding aside from wow itself
[9:04:45] dalvynthedrunk: Lost Ark raids seem cool, but isometric view kind of takes away some of the epic scale feel of a raid
[9:05:29] dalvynthedrunk: @darkh79 Wildstar raids were definitely the most WoW like, but RIFT was up there as well
[9:05:45] dalvynthedrunk: Never tried ESO raids, can't imagine they are much to write home about
[9:06:58] dalvynthedrunk: No idea lol
[9:07:09] vignola99: yeah if its aesthetics and the set, rift and wildstar are the only comparable ones really
[9:07:16] layercake2004: First boss seems likes a pain in the ass.. good sign for things to come on difficulty.. But than again you could steamroll the rest thats wow..
[9:07:22] vignola99: FF and Lost ark seem to have 10/10 boss encounters, but not necessarly raids
[9:07:46] Orthobullet: What
[9:07:49] vignola99: raids as in the raid experience
[9:08:40] dalvynthedrunk: Yeah, though Gw2 raids I think were more in between, they were connected like WOW but not quite as epic, with a few exceptions, byt they also kinda ditched them
[9:09:16] vignola99: gw2 bosses are pretty good but they're very undertuned, also something that I thikn makes them less epic is the overall sound design
[9:09:56] celzior: hey chat! thinking about coming back to wow after a long break how is Warlocks atm? or is there any other general recommendations for PVP/PVE wise? i suck at tanking/healing lol
[9:10:23] dalvynthedrunk: Also powercreep has nerfed the raids hard
[9:10:31] vignola99: there's only 2 gear levels, encounters are generally udertuned for any "elite spec" tbh
[9:10:47] vignola99: its a major issue imo they should just tune up most raid bosses and everyone will be happy lol
[9:11:19] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 they also need to add an easier mode though, easy, normal hard, raid participation is too low, why they ditched raids
[9:11:48] pacificmc1: I like the aesthetics of this raid
[9:12:00] pacificmc1: Good break from the dark colors
[9:12:01] dalvynthedrunk: Yeah, if Raids were popular they would make them, but the vas majority of gw2 players are just open world people, so raids are too much of an investment
[9:12:01] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk raid participation is super low in every game, i dont think people justify the level of investment raids take with engagement, they do it because it attracts a whole other audience etc etc but maybe im wrong
[9:12:21] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  Boss ran over them,  haha
[9:12:35] GoobleGamingTV: We cant hear them @Towelliee . On purpose?
[9:12:38] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 yeah in every game its low proportional to population, but I guarantee a much larger percentage of WoWs pop does lfr, and FF with normal
[9:12:52] Ludicruz: @Towelliee looked like when the boss ran over them,  they dropped  dead.  :D I did not notice any attacks going through.,
[9:13:02] vignola99: much larger compared to gw yeah for sure ! but it'll still be marginally low imo
[9:13:14] dalvynthedrunk: Strikes got better participation, which is why they are getting active development and raids are
[9:13:25] Justtise: i got it Towelliee
[9:13:26] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[9:13:50] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 Size doesnt matter though, I am saying if both had 100k players, WoW would have much more of that 100k doing raid content than gw2 would, mostly cuz of lfr
[9:13:54] vignola99: strikes are also mostly recycled bosses from LW so its kinda much easier to make than raids mostly I believe
[9:14:00] vignola99: that's true yeah
[9:14:27] sortehenning: Where is your survival hunter?
[9:14:34] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  I checked out the clip of those two dying,  looks like the boss stomped with it¬¥s feet where they stood at.
[9:14:35] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 yeah, and in End of Dragons the new Strike raids have challenge modes for more hardcore players, prolly the best comrpomise
[9:14:39] Alexkayzz: boss be like: fuck this aggro shit I'm killin the dps
[9:14:56] GoobleGamingTV: On purpose you muted the discord?

[9:15:13] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk we'll see, was never a fan of strikes you just stack spam boons close your eyes and bosses die, maybe cm will do them justice
[9:15:31] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  I think it was a combination of the boss hitting you with a melee and the stomp right after.
[9:15:53] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 Yeah that is why I am excited for CMs, they have said like 5 times now they will be for raiders, so I am confidentr they will be improved, Whisper of Jormag is a good fight tho
[9:16:17] DarqStalker: I saw a guild named The Towellieban on Area 52. Is that guild related to Towelliee in anyway?
[9:16:26] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk whisper and bone are "ok", everything else is ResidentSleeper
[9:17:00] dalvynthedrunk: But im mostly a gw2 open world and pvp player anyway lol, I just want more instanced content because its good for the game, Lost Ark will be my main isntanced game
[9:17:03] nilachip: will 9.2 be the final patch in SL ?
[9:17:40] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk you dont have much to complain about if you like open world its still one of the best, i mostly play mmo's for raids so yeah gw is pretty low in my ranking (i still play it tho for wvw )
[9:18:52] Ludicruz: @Towelliee Is this the first boss test of the evening or ?
[9:18:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube videos at https://www.youtube.com/towelliee
[9:19:00] Ponickz: 2nd
[9:19:08] Ludicruz: k,  thanks @Redux09
[9:20:47] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 Hopefully Strike CMs are great for you also then! Making time to raid is too hard for me these days :(

[9:22:30] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk ty, yep cant wait ! wish they'd give us a date i wanna play LA too
[9:22:52] pacificmc1: man i love how the raid looks aesthetically tho
[9:23:03] pacificmc1: reminds me of that ulduar section with Freya or whatever
[9:23:20] H0bbitK1ng: i mean theyve done pretty well with both end bosses this tier
[9:23:33] reggiepowa: last bosses are always buggy for world first guilds
[9:23:38] Orthobullet: Unfortunatly i dont think they will retest. Will have to wait for the mythic players to go through them when live
[9:23:45] Funderik: people asked for no raid testing, "you think you do but you don't"
[9:23:46] Alexkayzz: At least we got lucky with Shadowlands and it became the best expac ever made tho Kappa
[9:23:53] bukka_hot: they will probably play it safe and make the bosses really hard and slowly nerf them
[9:24:04] pacificmc1: inb4 the jailer is a oneshot KEKW
[9:24:05] vignola99: @H0bbitK1ng you mean SOD ? that wasnt well tuned if you watched the WFR, they had to go some shit lol
[9:24:09] lithium364: i hope jailer mythic will be bugged and rextroy oneshots him before limit
[9:24:10] Orthobullet: I think wf race is gonna be exciting
[9:24:16] vignola99: @H0bbitK1ng go through sorry
[9:24:41] valuecardz: e PogChamp
[9:25:23] MARTZiiE: if 10.0 introduces tinkers who do you think they could tie that into possible dragon themed xpac?
[9:25:49] pacificmc1: King Mekkartorque is clearly secretly a dragon
[9:25:52] vignola99: @chie_gaming us mortals are never worried about tuning tbh it always get fixed, its mostly for the world first racers
[9:25:53] pacificmc1: The gnome form is just his shapeshift orm
[9:26:14] Aidler: @pacificmc1 true
[9:26:22] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 Betting EoD is feb 25th but the CMs for Strikes will be coming a few weeks post launch afaik
[9:26:26] pacificmc1: A disgruntled senior citizen at Blizzard told me this
[9:27:08] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk oh shit thta's elden rings release date lol man february is packed
[9:27:54] pacificmc1: Blizzard polish KEKW
[9:28:10] vignola99: when is 9.2 supposed to be out, by march ?
[9:28:12] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 Yeah I am fucked for time in February lol, Lost Ark early feb, Elden Ring and Gw2 late feb, 9.2 mid march possibly
[9:28:20] pacificmc1: End of Feb/start of March it seems, @vignola99
[9:28:30] vignola99: oof that's a good year to be a gamer
[9:28:30] N_Tys: We don‚Äôt know yet
[9:28:32] vignola99: and prob lose your job
[9:28:38] h1ghl1v3: is it your gear like end game gear?
[9:28:42] dalvynthedrunk: End of feb cuz blizzard wants to cuck the gw2 expansion Madge Madge
[9:28:50] pacificmc1: @N_Tys True, but we can guess that it's March 1st by the latest since MDIs are mid march :D
[9:29:08] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 My job is moving to a 7 days on/7 days off schedule so I get some good game time every other week PogChamp
[9:29:13] N_Tys: Yeah true, a lot of testing to get through so we‚Äôll see
[9:29:19] pacificmc1: yep definitely
[9:29:27] vignola99: @dalvynthedrunk kinda jealous ngl
[9:29:45] dalvynthedrunk: @vignola99 Well 84 hours a week will be rough, but idc gimme that 2 weeks off a month
[9:30:05] vignola99: its enticing, dunno if I can do it but on paper i like it LUL

[9:47:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Murlocs alliance-only?? Ouch!
[9:47:32] Palgor: Yeah, you are true, and I miss those Icecrown Citadel  times :)
[9:48:00] Palgor: That was THE best raid
[9:48:47] Palgor: Ulduar was decent also :)
[9:49:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was thinking the Furbolgs could be like pandas, and both factions could choose them. They could do that with Murlocs, too
[9:49:56] Orthobullet: Barkbury colon
[9:49:58] Palgor: Citadel was more compact so it was lil better for me :)
