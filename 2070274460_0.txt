[3:53:06] fenris_goblin_bath_water: Guzu have you played "WoW"? WoW is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth. Similar to other MMORPGs, the game allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs)
[3:53:07] tempacc47: you could farm that in a couple hours no problem @Guzu
