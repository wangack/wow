[4:22:30] mavericks312: asmon is off any blizz list at this point

[4:22:37] theDirtyon3: ^
[4:22:38] Thoreya: Asmon would be bitching that he sucks at the game and hates how WoW has hard content
[4:22:50] Thunderbrew: @mavericks312 Earning Flying, Teleports instead of Flight Paths, superior story telling for a couple things.

[4:40:04] Faeldric: they could really just add Dark Ranger to hunter as a 4th spec
[4:40:07] Rudric_Ice: yes give more classes
[4:40:08] Frank4LuLz: hybrid classes like they did in Swtolr
[4:40:09] manmower: revamp some old specs instead

[4:41:43] cptrogers123: We already have garrisons? why would we have housing aswell?
[4:41:43] captiv8: I would be more surprised if they don‚Äôt have a new class
[4:41:48] byrom88: yeah would be nice for them to make all the raids relevent for an expansion
[4:41:49] HilariousMax: 65 or 70 for level cap raise? Or prefer none at all?
[4:41:50] Exxcar: Some of the specs whole identity is dots
[4:41:50] Broomba: sad, that too many people have these fantasies about wow 2, unreal engine 5, new classes, etc -- how do they even function on a linear plane?

[4:41:53] Taz_85: A ''Living world'' in WoW like what they do in GW2 would be awesome, instead of a higher level  cap

[4:42:37] Frank4LuLz: We turn into Dragons, like power rangers or Voltron
[4:42:39] manmower: aspects with conduit slots that modify abilities

[4:45:05] PvtHudson093: Will we get a legendary trinket this time? ring/neck/cloak has been done before
[4:45:05] IzacCS: I would like Guild housing more than player housing. Make a cool Tavern for all guildies to hang out in. Portals to all expansions etc
[4:45:09] Exxcar: I would rather have a level than power tied to aspects. I want to choose an aspect purely based on which one I like
[4:45:12] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[4:45:16] DeanoTV: paragon levels would be good

[4:45:38] Rudric_Ice: Just add account wide everything and ill be happy
[4:45:41] stratiss: getting me ready to be disappointed on Tuesday
[4:45:41] Akermay: But if they have a paragon system, sure they'd want to it last through multiple expacs? Not be tied to aspects?

[4:47:39] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: i really want smth Altfriendly. I took them down from 6 to 2 ,just because i hate rep grind on more than one char
[4:47:43] TheCliffyShow: I want player housing...and high elves. I will die on that high elf hill.
[4:47:45] BlackCl0ud: yup just wanna play the game
[4:47:46] tydrennistv: i wants a classic feel wehere people play more then a couple weeks and stop
[4:47:53] Savagedenny: I just want universal gold
[4:47:57] MistaHat: I do wish they had the Job system from FF and smaller raid sizes from FF. Beyond that, WoW would be successful to me then too
[4:47:58] Akermay: I'll grind anything, but I don't want to do it twice. So I never touch alts
[4:48:05] BfAleTitan: as someone with 1 of every class at 60, i agree that fully account wide everything is far better than what we currently have
[4:48:05] BlackCl0ud: we just wanna chill on alts
[4:48:07] Funderik: having alts is a choice not forced so
[4:48:12] bro_tein: its because making people spend that time on alts ups their metrics

[4:48:37] Gurtogg: i hope we get emissaries back instead of callings
[4:48:40] FooFighter1939: account wide story progression
[4:48:42] Exxcar: Their metrics of success needs to change before they are willing to make alts more accessible
[4:48:52] captiv8: I would like to see a legendary system like Legion again. That system made me play every day for that chance on a leggo dropping randomly. Such a cool feeling.
[4:48:55] Affiiance: For the love of God link your rep some how
[4:49:02] Tokies: alts should be in the mission table
[4:49:03] manmower: account-wide aspect progress?

[4:59:03] smashwow: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect that's not really a twist when everyone is seeing it come from 20 miles away
[4:59:09] mavericks312: whoever designed halondrus,painsmith, and sludgefist deserves a raise
[4:59:09] TheCliffyShow: Well, spirits in Ardenweald can eventually go back to their worlds. Just takes a long time. Maybe, she'll be back for 25.0.

[5:02:52] coweelissa: I just wished they did something interesting and novel with the dragons instead of the usual tropes
[5:02:59] mavericks312: imagine on tuesday they actually show xfaction guilds as a new feature
[5:03:00] tomcruise210: FOR THE HORDE
[5:03:15] manmower: if they do something about regrowing Teldrassil I will have to unsub

[5:03:54] papascruge: @Ezekyler most definitely, they have all the mechanical models to work with
[5:03:57] dimofodi: Cross-faction parties were impossible...now look at 9.2.5....it's just how much work will it take to get it done.
[5:04:02] Proxzo: It's probably better to say "Impractical" rather than "Impossible"
[5:04:07] Gurtogg: indie company with spaghetti code

[5:05:02] TheCliffyShow: As someone who prefers Alliance asesthically, I'm happy about it.'
[5:05:25] Synk_live: should just use Warmode as any Horde V Alliance stuff, otherwise everyone can play together and do anything
[5:05:27] KombatWombat07: there's always the possibility of players keeping things horde vs alliance if they want, so the flexibility is good
[5:05:27] BlackCl0ud: asesthically LUL
[5:05:31] tomcruise210: what the last pserver i watched did was the world pvp was still there but you could guild up and do instance shit together

[5:07:51] tomcruise210: you have to make a premade group
[5:08:04] EthicalHermit: If they keep faction specific stuff, its actually better for them, because people have to play both to get them
[5:08:07] MILESkg21: that would be awkward
[5:08:09] ILikeKillTheZombies: and armor set dragon themed
[5:08:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want a 5 headed dragon mount
[5:08:12] mavericks312: think of all the new dragon mounts coming
[5:08:12] reqluim66: Most importantly, The horde won and the alliance lost the warü§´
[5:08:12] UnknownLegendDPS: im hoping its a dragon i want a dragon mount
[5:08:14] manmower: make it an egg "unlocks after 6 months sub time"
[5:08:15] Karn1987: the mount is a laberdodle
[5:08:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 50/50 are the odds
[5:08:25] generaljosh721: the mount is a chicken. The precursor to dragons
[5:08:28] giggachadwar: the new class available with the pre purchase
[5:08:31] Gungingungir: Mount will be a flyin tree - since alexstraza transformed into one to spy
[5:08:33] UnknownLegendDPS: im preordering the most expensive edition EZ Clap
[5:08:35] audderd: I would just think it would be funny if the new expansion had nothing to do with dragons LUL
[5:08:36] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: it either is or isn't
[5:08:44] Skorb: pre order for a game that's 2 years out? Kappa
[5:08:44] Kalitvenec: rubyFork
[5:08:47] Zantex0: are you leveling?
[5:08:53] tomcruise210: premade groups in the group finder can do cross faction but instanced content like dungeon finder and random BGs arent allowed
[5:08:55] MILESkg21: they did with DH
[5:09:10] Velashen: Yeah, they have done it before. Not out of the question.
[5:09:20] captiv8: What if we get a new slot for legendaries?  Like hold a dragon scale or something.
[5:09:21] xEskii: the mount should be a whelpling that has to carry our fat asses around

[5:13:40] Lestatis: TD was glorious
[5:13:41] obbi87: @PhatKiwi 50 people is not alot whne we talk about all the players in the world :P
[5:13:44] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee of course not that why balancing pve its dumb
[5:13:47] OssaLive: i feel like they only complained about not having access to it. Not that corruption wasn't fun
[5:13:47] flebbooo: I haven't done this much m+ in a while, just feels good to play my classes
[5:13:50] cdk058: still think corrupton was a bit too much lol
[5:13:51] N3llee: this where we'll disagree.. borrowed power is such a poor design decision.
[5:13:51] DeanoTV: corruption was NOT hard to get
[5:13:55] DeanoTV: from world quests
[5:13:57] Skorb: They just don't like losing that power after every patch, I think.
[5:14:01] Faeldric: the issue isn't when you are powerful, it's when it drops off and you feel weak
[5:14:06] BlackCl0ud: tier sets need to stay PERIOD
[5:14:08] Racyinnuendos: But they will
[5:14:08] Exxcar: Also put in the forge week one...
[5:14:09] KombatWombat07: true. tier sets made wow, wow
[5:14:12] St0rmyPl4ys: tier set brought me back no lie
[5:14:21] Synk_live: losing power has been the game every patch EVERY expansion
[5:14:23] t0csik: 30 tanks RIADS with coruptions
[5:14:23] zgag: Never to Blizzard means they will get rid of them again. p
[5:14:23] lmtheboogie: @towelliee can I get some advice? Take a chill job doing something I don‚Äôt enjoy for 38$/hr. Take stressful job doing something I don‚Äôt like for 47$/hr?
[5:14:25] mrsuflakis: maybe they bring  back corruption for 1 season
[5:14:37] zgag: Blizzard always goes away from the popular opinion
[5:14:41] BelllGoR: it feels bad playing a class with a bad set though
[5:14:48] BlackCl0ud: actually true
[5:14:49] tydrennistv: people love farming old raids for tier set tmog
[5:14:51] Synk_live: I see the issues with tier sets, just has to be easy to get, being able to make pieces is awesome
[5:14:52] BlackCl0ud: i wanna look like a warlock ffs
[5:14:57] captiv8: Towelliee, what kind of legendary system do you think the next xpac will have?
[5:14:59] Kisswani: but muh warlock bunny this tier is uwu
[5:15:00] mavericks312: most important step is that there back
[5:15:02] ILikeKillTheZombies: i hardly see anyone wearing new sets
[5:15:08] ILikeKillTheZombies: from zm
[5:15:08] obbi87: @Towelliee Many of the server who is "low" pop will be medium, as they are connect with other realms. they share the same statues. So some server will still be low pop, you will only see people from other realms
[5:15:12] Synk_live: I've almost never used a new tier set mog over t6 lol
[5:15:12] BlackCl0ud: warlock bunny wtf
[5:15:13] Khade_Tyrson: Because i don't like the space/robot look....
[5:15:13] manmower: Ion: "hold my beer"

[5:15:16] cahoots82: get the d3 set designers working on wow sets...

[5:15:31] N3llee: thats it

[5:15:41] N3llee: do away with them
[5:15:43] BelllGoR: @N3llee sounds boring
[5:16:00] mythradrill: high server means 5k plus. full is 10k. locked is at 15k the limits are much lower now. its not like before
[5:16:12] N3llee: There is nothing cool about leggos when everyone has 2-3
[5:16:18] zgag: To be fair with Blizzard there were many people who complained about tier.  Ie having item level 278 that can't be used due to have a 265 tier piece.
[5:16:20] N3llee: defeats the purpose
[5:16:21] Exxcar: coduwhats?
[5:16:24] vDrYuukey: i forgot there is an upgrae with mythic jailer to conduits ...

[5:17:04] N3llee: thats all the borrowed power we need
[5:17:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @Towelliee remember Legion started with no tier in EN
[5:17:08] dutchie76: they nerfed survival hunter LUL
[5:17:30] BlackCl0ud: imo they should remake legendaries like they were in the old days
[5:17:31] Nokterian: Legion had one of the coolest tier sets
[5:17:36] manmower: they should just have a big paragon system with slots we fill in with player choice
[5:17:38] BelllGoR: @N3llee the boomer mindest that legos need to be special and only one class an expac
[5:17:46] PvtHudson093: they cant make tier work with double leggos without it conflictiong
[5:17:46] DeanoTV: Quest legendary like MOP would be sick
[5:17:47] Exxcar: I liked the concept of Azerite Armor, hated the accquisition (which is a reoccuring theme lately with this team)
[5:17:48] ILikeKillTheZombies: maybe they were already working on 10.0 with most power
[5:17:51] N3llee: Look at BC. Its numbers are popping off .. ther doesnt need to be any leggos or gimick system. Tier sets is all people need.
[5:17:53] ILikeKillTheZombies: and went with shadowlands just as it is
[5:17:56] arcanite77: remembering how hyped people were for Torghast when they first revealed SL makes me a bit skeptical of this next reveal, lol
[5:18:03] vDrYuukey: tier sets change your rotation every season which is fun mostly
[5:18:04] BelllGoR: @N3llee KEKW
[5:18:23] Xaviwan078: I FEEL THE POOWWA!!!
[5:18:32] mihailo1306: power is cool just dont make it too convoluted
[5:18:33] N3llee: @N3llee the zoomer mindset that they want everything handed to them without any effort or free.
[5:18:33] kharnij83: survival decent finally?
[5:18:38] Funderik: BUT BORROWED POWER WAAAAA
[5:18:39] stratiss: power is good, but infinitely farmable power isn't a great feeling unless it can be account wide
[5:18:40] tragx: I just don't want a boring power grind that detracts from the actual game
[5:18:43] Skyymarshal: A power i dont have to spend 3 hrs per day to maitain
[5:18:48] NateYoungTV: @N3llee okay boomer
[5:18:49] Kisswani: I need soulshapes to stay
[5:18:56] N3llee: Borrowed Power is a terrible design choice for any game
[5:18:59] manmower: toned down versions
[5:19:04] dislocatedb2: essecnce were fun
[5:19:07] Synk_live: Torgast just ended up being too slow / long, needed to be faster and more abilities provided
[5:19:10] Rudric_Ice: im okay with Cloack power in bfa i would happy with that type of power
[5:19:15] captiv8: @n3llee Then why do you play?
[5:19:19] xziyn: Ashen for Holy should probably stay too
[5:19:19] Theliahh: @N3llee game would be mega stale without borrowed power
[5:19:19] BloodxxMerchant: What about like 3 powers per flight (1 tank, 1 DPS, 1 Healer power) all are the same just flavored different
[5:19:25] DeanoTV: If you want nothing new go back to classic and stay there KEKW
[5:19:32] MxViolet: true
[5:19:35] manmower: islands were more fun than torghast because they were open and variety, but torghast design concepts were better
[5:19:40] obbi87: Tower in Lost ark is WAY better then what wow have
[5:19:40] MxViolet: torghast now is what it should have started as
[5:19:41] Rudric_Ice: boss rush ?
[5:19:44] Synk_live: now torgast is pretty good, but starting out it was crap
[5:19:44] Lestatis: the jailer's gauntlet is really fun
[5:19:47] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee Do u think we wilkl actually get housin?
[5:19:47] N3llee: @captiv8 I play TBC. I havent touched retail since 9.1
[5:19:52] LlamaCub: whats changed with Torghast?
[5:19:54] Nokterian: Jailer's Gauntlet is what it should have been
[5:19:57] Kisswani: Even torments , I remember people being against it
[5:20:00] Reesezpiecez: this iteration of torghast is the best cause i haven't had to play it since the patch dropped
[5:20:01] Kisswani: yeah
[5:20:04] Funderik: @N3llee disagree, without it games are boring af and plain
[5:20:19] Korupcija_: they'll remove time from M+ and it will be boring
[5:20:23] TheCliffyShow: Proof that the fans sometimes don't know what the hell they are talking about.
[5:20:24] N3llee: @N3llee thats because you dont know what a good mmo is
[5:20:30] Funderik: borrowed power = you think you DON'T but you DO
[5:20:34] Theliahh: islands were fun
[5:20:50] Falkhord: What you doing towl
[5:20:52] ILikeKillTheZombies: I prefer towers like the one in Lost ark, i don't really like torghast
[5:20:56] DeanoTV: @N3llee let me guess u like pressing 1 button every 20 seconds in BC?
[5:20:56] Snabido: Islands the new Argent Tournament: lots of collectables
[5:20:58] TheRiwen: torghast would been fine if it has been optional
