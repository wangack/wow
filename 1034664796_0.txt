[0:36:04] SonofHorus82: @Lethal_Intent I think 51? I know he hit 50 last night.
[0:36:13] Biorrwolf: So I'm currently lv24, Belf Pally. Only about 2-4 hours to play a day. Think I can hit 60 with those limits?
[0:36:29] Lethal_Intent: nice
[0:36:32] 3dRes: That thoon command desperately needs a towDerp emote
[0:36:40] elitepower97: prob not but goodluck @Biorrwolf
[0:36:45] Lethal_Intent: ive only managed 30 atm
[0:36:51] xImmortalGodx: @Biorrwolf not to sound mean but probably not lol
[0:36:52] CritcobainTV: @Biorrwolf no way lol
[0:37:02] SonofHorus82: @Biorrwolf I dont think so unless you get boosts. Leveling slows down once you get into the 40s.
[0:37:14] CritcobainTV: even with boosts you'll struggle to hit 60
[0:37:17] RageerPLZ: @Biorrwolf no

[0:38:15] Dawneskye: don't worry about the time it takes, just enjoy the ride, you may not have to fight for mobs once you get to outlands
[0:38:19] SonofHorus82: @Biorrwolf what you need to do is give @critcobain a shit ton of gold to boost you.
[0:38:22] Mecabeast: it took me about 8ish weeks to hit 60 on my first toon on classic when it first launched playing about 4/5hrs a day
[0:38:42] othraerir: outlands will be a shitshow early on to tag mobs :(
[0:38:46] CritcobainTV: @SonofHorus82 i haven't done boosts for gold in like 3+ months lol
[0:38:52] NoWaayMan: bought the boost to 58 last night. spent almost 2 hours going back and forth from strat to org trying to figure out what to do lol
[0:38:56] RageerPLZ: @Biorrwolf no, not for tbc I don't think maybe a single month in tbc, 1-60 is rough but 60-70 is maybe a day or two

[2:27:18] aleck1776: 12g prob on the AH
[2:27:19] brothaxeno: each can hold every buff but you go about storing some at a time
[2:27:21] ArcaneSyntax: no elites, was just there
[2:27:24] NovaSun84: So it screenshots your current WB's so once you get to Org, then ZG, then Dire Maul then you screenshot it
[2:27:40] aleck1776: they hold a snapshot of all the buffs you currently have
[2:27:44] NovaSun84: You can add in Sonflower buff for 5 total

[2:28:06] mikejames01: mine been on for a year or more with some reboots
[2:28:13] camslam: damn i shut mine off every night too lol
[2:28:15] CritcobainTV: starting at 2 minutes
[2:28:20] NovaSun84: Yeah same Aro725 I need those pending windows updates to go that night instead of cloggin em all up
[2:28:24] IianaDRK: u should restart every so often to clean out the cache and other things clogging ur computer up
[2:28:44] jerexify: I shut down my PC every night... lol Whoops.
[2:29:04] ScytaleTv: thats what she said
[2:29:08] NovaSun84: Yeah, if you leave it on for over a month, you're just funnelling all the bad into that eventual shut down...
[2:29:09] mikejames01: A year always on never a issue here reboots once a week
[2:29:20] CritcobainTV: So general rule of thumb, if you turn your pc off multiple times a day, its' gonna be bad for it. if you turn it off for like 8 hours a day or more u should be fine, but if you turn it off for 4 hours, then play for 6 and then turn it off again, it can shorten the lifespan a bit

Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || TBC launch is on June 1st
[4:39:34] maklayy: what do u think of human pallys towel?
[4:39:37] salak_daddy: @Towelliee what auction addon do you have?
[4:39:46] siliconwafer: i never played vanilla or classic, but were the quests really that much harder?
[4:39:56] buckshot_feast: the Devilsuars might have if you had your music too loud LUL
[4:40:16] Rentfreespace: is cross realm grouping still a thing? I just saw a asmongold clip on youtube showing that it was a thing
[4:40:22] nonstopdisco: towelliee is this your main for TBC?
[4:40:50] VictorAvalanche: it is
[4:40:52] tadeeche: steggadons still elite
[4:41:27] ClassicMalcontent: @s2CeLeRiTY thanks. I went into System > Advanced Graphics options and explicitly selected my RTX 2080 Super. Hope that does the trick.
[4:41:29] Rentfreespace: @VictorAvalanche are they going to keep it or was it an "experiment"?

[4:42:16] OrkanenTV: @siliconwafer Yeah quests are more difficult.
[4:42:33] maklayy: why did u lvl a warrior then?
[4:42:46] OrkanenTV: @siliconwafer Not necessarily more fun.
[4:43:16] Sarole: 55 to 60 is a real drag
[4:43:37] siliconwafer: So when did they change the difficulty? TBC or some later xpac?
[4:44:02] bgriff87: wait during a sponsored stream? LUL
[4:44:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:44:20] OrkanenTV: TBC is much better in my opinion. But each expansion improves on quests.
[4:45:07] cbiskit89: i think wrath was probably the biggest turning point. it felt like the beginning to the trend of blizzard wanting to focus on the max level grind instead of leveling as the grind too
[4:45:19] Avaricious_83: Righteous Fury
[4:45:47] CritcobainTV: BIS
[4:45:59] shimwood: Wrath Kreygasm
[4:46:05] Wildside1177: It is what you call it.
[4:46:06] SilkeySmooth: why because of lfg added?
[4:46:21] VictorAvalanche: Wrath when deathknights were fun to play
[4:46:22] warrenny: That a bad thing
[4:46:35] Sarole: at least they did it gradually
[4:46:39] CaptainJoeyNY: I dont see the casualization a bad thing, the hardcore is still there
[4:46:43] buckshot_feast: just spam the AOE abilities Pepega
[4:46:50] oldmangamer0: Witch is true
[4:47:00] Wildside1177: 0.03% of people saw the original Naxx when it was out.
[4:47:09] TorupInc: Hey Towelliee
[4:47:13] Lethal_Intent: khazuals baby
[4:47:14] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:47:15] Chiraakitteh: I wish they had instead made a separate version of the raid tho
[4:47:23] DrakhanGaming: I cant even kill KJ on mythic with pugs today
[4:47:24] Keilsyar: Feel like wrath was a good balance... maybe I'm biased.
[4:47:34] oldmangamer0: I love Wrath
[4:47:37] warrenny: Cos muru?
[4:47:37] CardinalTX: Casual boomers rise up!
[4:47:44] AtomicHeartSon: Naxx was a weird position though, BC was announced and was going to be out a few months after Naxx40, most people were just looking forward to TBC
[4:47:45] Znza: @Keilsyar 100% i agree with you
[4:47:46] oldmangamer0: Its my fave Xpac
[4:47:50] henrikjuncker: to me wrath was the best expansion.
[4:47:51] Chiraakitteh: But obviously they didn‚Äôt want to spend time to do that on old content
[4:48:01] RageerPLZ: I miss being in a major city and seeing a single person standing out from the rest, with a legendary it drove me to one day be that person and made me feel good getting quests/attunements done along the path, now everyone is just normal to me and not very exciting, mythic raiding doesn't seperate the gap much.
[4:48:02] mulletrocker11358: everyone should be able to see the contnent.. BUT not everyone should get the same powerful gear
[4:48:13] KormosTV: Wrath was the start of the downfall but overall that expac was fine
[4:48:17] toobaked1987: Blizzard does do a great job at catering to a wide audience
[4:48:22] Noctambulant00: They added heroic raids to still keep that hard aspect in Wrath.
[4:48:24] OrkanenTV: Wrath could honestly have been harder.
[4:48:24] CritcobainTV: BuT toWeLlIeE!!!! ArThAs
[4:48:25] AtomicHeartSon: I love Wrath but TBH some of that is just because it was my first expansion
[4:48:47] KormosTV: TBC is the shit though. The epitome of WoW
[4:48:49] lieutenantdan416: same atomic
[4:48:59] Lemonsqze: What about togc Kappa
[4:49:00] CaptainJoeyNY: wrath was awesome, but ToC and Nax were pretty easy mode
[4:49:00] mulletrocker11358: i may stay in TBC classic if its offered
[4:49:04] neverbornlucky: hardcore players are like toddlers they don't know what they want but wine till they get it then pee their pants when they dont
[4:49:08] lieutenantdan416: i start end bc then raided in wrath so naxx wasnt even stale to me lol
[4:49:13] CardinalTX: Everyone should get the same powerful gear.   IF they do the content that rewards that gear
[4:49:14] Wildside1177: @SixFourBoom I don't know anyone 58 or over who plays this game. I doubt very many boomers play. Lots of GenXers like Towelliee play though :)
[4:49:22] ProjectSevan: Wrath was the first expansion where I was like conscious. I was like 12 in TBC so I was carried through everything by my guild
[4:49:29] Iolgz: @towelliee Ulduar is still, in my opinion, the best raid ever made. it's beautiful and you can tell how much time was sunk into the making of it.
[4:49:53] CardinalTX: @wildside1177   I‚Äôm 57. LUL
[4:49:56] latched_fire: @SixFourBoom My dad was 64 he still played the game :)

[4:50:06] dutchie76: Wrath Classic is next LUL
[4:50:07] Lethal_Intent: @Wildside1177 we have a older gentleman whos over that age and pumps the hunter in retail in our guild hes 9/10m
[4:50:09] dutchie76: 2023
[4:50:13] Wildside1177: @SixFourBoom So not even you are a boomer. You are close though.
[4:50:19] Lemonsqze: LUL
[4:50:28] Wildside1177: @Lethal_Intent Right but there are not many.
[4:50:41] dutchie76: Rob you going to play Wrath Classic?
[4:50:43] Austei: 3 darkes shit shows
[4:50:51] Chiraakitteh: And then you realized that bliss had to make content for casuals also or just stop making the game
[4:50:54] Noctambulant00: I mean lets be real, there were lots of casuals at endgame in TBC too.
[4:50:57] K_A_N_J_I: As someone that started in BC I liked wrath. I did not experience naxx in vanilla so it was a new fun raid to me and Ulduar was great. I also think icc was great too but I did play Warcraft 3 and loved the art has storyline. Grand crusade area wasn‚Äôt great but solid. IMO @towelliee
[4:50:59] CodyKane: @Towelliee Good Morning my dude!
[4:50:59] Chiraakitteh: Blizz*
[4:51:13] Immanis: casuals just dont have time to play wow for 10hrs a day
[4:51:30] neverbornlucky: I stopped tanking in cata said gear not worth this trouble
[4:51:32] CardinalTX: @wildside1177 100% a boomer. Born 1964 last official year for boomers.
[4:51:33] OrkanenTV: Cata was the only expansion I didn't play at all.
[4:51:40] CaptainJoeyNY: All payers matter
[4:51:40] buckshot_feast: 9h? huge casual LUL
[4:51:47] DrakeDuude: early days of WoW were 10X as toxic and elitist. it sucked ass
[4:51:58] dutchie76: anyone have any guesses to when 9.1 will be out?
[4:51:59] SteveSD: lol it turned into blizz going heavy cash shop
[4:52:02] SteveSD: and here we are today
[4:52:11] Chiraakitteh: It‚Äôs like pet battle stuff, I‚Äôm not really interested, but lots of folks find that fun and it allows them lots of tome flexibility, unlike raiding
[4:52:23] blvdxoxo: were all 12-15 years older now in much different lives too, cant play wow all day
[4:52:47] Wildside1177: @SixFourBoom Oh yeah that is right. There are 2 definitions. One ends in 1964 and one ends in 1967.
[4:53:13] neverbornlucky: dungeons were straight forward in TBC and classic. You knew what to do and where to stand. Cata thought ok lets make the CC and spots harder to stand
[4:54:04] CaptainJoeyNY: How do we get our BC collectors edition pet?
[4:54:14] neverbornlucky: hardcore players complained in TBC that blizzard was giving player welfare gear it wasn't worth the challenge
[4:54:15] mrelgaato: Booty bay
[4:54:31] CaptainJoeyNY: I got it on one
[4:54:35] CaptainJoeyNY: I just dont remember where
[4:54:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:54:44] Calithial: Just talk to an innkeeper?
[4:54:45] Tharia: there was something about that on wowhead
[4:54:56] buckshot_feast: @neverbornlucky yes, the amount of crying about the badge gears LUL
[4:54:57] venom366: botty bay or inn kepper :P
[4:55:00] CaptainJoeyNY: thats it
[4:55:04] CaptainJoeyNY: I got it at innkeeper
[4:55:06] CaptainJoeyNY: ty
[4:55:31] dutchie76: hated this escort quest lol
[4:55:34] dutchie76: back in the day
[4:55:51] CodyKane: I'm about to order a new round of gfuel, what are some of you fav flavors?
[4:55:55] dutchie76: yep
[4:55:57] force_FMD: same
[4:56:08] MrGattz: he only fainted twice for me
[4:56:11] MrGattz: wasnt so bad
[4:56:20] dutchie76: i think the other faction can kill him too no?
[4:56:21] MrGattz: didnt even pull any mobs
[4:56:23] neverbornlucky: in cata blizzard thought they would do to the hardcore again. I do not even do cata dungeons on chromie time
[4:56:40] dutchie76: cata sucked
[4:56:53] dutchie76: only dungeon i liked was grim batol
[4:57:32] imhankey: !ui

[4:59:10] thrakan84: there are a few paths up
[4:59:18] thrakan84: mostly on the other side
[4:59:33] bapele45: 4 chests ana dlal garboo
[5:00:07] toobaked1987: @Towelliee are you concerned at all that retail may turn more towards collection-type gameplay and not a grind for power?
[5:00:20] neverbornlucky: MOP was so much better then CATA . Even WOD was better expansion
[5:00:29] browncoats: browncoats subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[5:00:39] toobaked1987: Yes. Do you think it will become to the standard of play?
[5:00:49] AtomicHeartSon: Cata was pretty good
[5:00:51] TheUnknowing: It's been that way but before it was tired to power, anima isn't.
[5:01:14] swordart_19: @toobaked1987 do you know items are cosmetics as well ?
[5:01:17] force_FMD: i didnt mind mop
[5:01:21] Atruis_: Anima is worse than AP
[5:01:26] thrakan84: keep going that way
[5:01:31] Atruis_: I want AP back

[5:01:32] thrakan84: you'll find a path up
[5:01:44] swordart_19: @L_CGamer why anima i Pog
[5:02:00] Ardailec: Can we just...not have some sort of A-power?
[5:02:00] toobaked1987: AP gave me a reason to continue logging into the game. Anima is so I can get a different variation of a bow cosmetic, less appealing. That is what I am referring to
[5:02:00] DrakhanGaming: mc run before launch?
[5:02:24] CaptainJoeyNY: gotta get the one at the top by the elite
[5:02:25] shimwood: No

[5:11:57] warrenny: Worst escort q of all time is all of them
[5:12:03] K_A_N_J_I: Idk the Tanaris chicken quest has you walk the whole zone and the turtle in tanaris too

[5:27:10] DelcoAF: how much damage does assclap do?
[5:27:34] nightwombat: plus no inn
[5:27:48] nightwombat: no hearthing
[5:27:53] delsea: can u avoid un goro?
[5:28:41] HeBeDead: asscalp can do a lot of damage its just really hard to consistently use with rage problems compared to a pally consc
[5:29:09] DrakhanGaming: thunderclap for me is 20 rage and 103 dmg
[5:29:10] Eraste: interesting, cause ungoro is my favorite classic zone
[5:29:28] rhodeos_: towOny towOny towOny

[5:30:36] ARS0N1ST: everyone acts like if you have more than 1 mob it takes korean apm to tank as warriors lol
[5:31:30] Exodeo_: My cat dreams
[5:31:30] itsyoboywill: Hey towel! Considering making a Gunnar purchase, what‚Äôs your take and which one do you recommend?
[5:31:38] Shrenko: my cat dreams all the time
[5:31:39] Exodeo_: I suddenly hear miauws while he's asleep
[5:31:39] theSalute: my cat does
[5:31:52] DrakhanGaming: My 2 pet rabbits dream
[5:31:57] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee shes bitching at that old lady that had the audacity to complain about her poop
[5:32:00] chrslp: My dog is crazy active in his sleep. Always twitching paws, growling, wagging his tail
[5:32:10] CaptainJoeyNY: lightningbolt 360?
[5:32:32] DrakhanGaming: sometimes my rabbit will lay on its side and her hind legs would motion as if she is hopping somewhere in her dream
[5:32:37] CaptainJoeyNY: As a pilot, I have an obligation to wear aviators
[5:32:37] DrakhanGaming: pretty fascinating
[5:32:44] Aravarth: Mavericks? DANGER ZONE-AH
[5:32:52] Aidler: lightningbolts with prescripion glases
[5:32:57] DrakeDuude: does gunner have clip ons for my current glasses?
[5:33:07] FaceMcShooty: my lightning bolt 360s came in the male today. i love them :D
[5:33:12] Aravarth: @Aidler Can you get them with prescription lenses?
[5:33:18] Aravarth: My glasses are due for replacement
[5:33:23] Aidler: yes you can for 300 -400 bucks
[5:33:38] Aidler: and you have to wait a couple of weeks
[5:33:43] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: is this the fabled ungoro crater
[5:33:55] Aravarth: @FaceMcShooty I think you mean "Came in the mail", "came in the male" means something entirely different KappaPride

[5:43:04] Moobot: @mrelgaato we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[5:43:20] force_FMD: how come they are not elite anymore, a qol change?
[5:43:36] CaptainJoeyNY: Im just giving you shit.
[5:43:36] SteveSD: i hate teh AH add on
[5:43:40] mrelgaato: BC prepatch
[5:43:43] Eraste: real talk i wish they just put retail AH in this
[5:43:50] SteveSD: the auction house add on mspams the ah with single stacks horse shit bids / buyouts
[5:43:51] Broomba: what???? people hate someone cause of an addon??????
[5:44:06] HeBeDead: what reason would they not have the new auction house system in TBC classic?
[5:44:11] mrelgaato: group looting is what we really need
[5:44:18] HeBeDead: maybe it would bust the system horribly
[5:44:21] mrelgaato: mass looting
[5:44:46] SonofHorus82: because the No Changes crowd would have lost their fucking minds if even the slightest thing changed for classic.
[5:44:52] HeBeDead: gotta purchase wotlk for mass looting Kappa
[5:44:58] DelcoAF: SHAY MAN!!!!!
[5:45:09] HeBeDead: yeah maybe the software and servers would be fried from an AH overhaul
[5:45:12] NovaSun84: #MyExperience towRee
[5:45:39] CritcobainTV: NO CHANGES towRee
[5:46:03] HeBeDead: yeah maybe its a manpower/expenditure they're not looking at currently, who knows
[5:46:50] SonofHorus82: I feel like having the current auction house in classic would really mess with my experience of going afk in Stormwind while I conscript an army to go farm me mats and gold.
[5:46:58] Shrenko: NotLikeThis
[5:47:01] HeBeDead: uWu
[5:47:02] shimwood: I'm gonna be a monkey! A monkey monkey monkey!
[5:47:03] force_FMD: is it monkey crap?  :D
[5:47:04] CritcobainTV: NotLikeThis
[5:47:05] Eraste: @Towelliee I liked Dan's idea for classic after wrath, yesterday. Said something like, 'alternate timelines, where 'what if this' happened instead of 'that' ' etc
[5:47:07] Wildside1177: Mobs that call for help are just....ugh
[5:47:10] JustAwaay: calm you tits
[5:47:12] 91Niki: Somebody take away Towelliee's gfuel please. he's had enough LUL
[5:47:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: monkey cave should be easy at 54

[5:47:24] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:47:38] HeBeDead: i vote MOP for alternate timeline
[5:47:44] Eraste: if they werent doing a classic +, for example
[5:47:49] Chiphazzord: we would go straight to mists
[5:47:51] delsea: towles u must avoid un goro area man
[5:47:52] jerexify: That's WoW 2.0! World of Warcraft: What Might Have Been...
[5:47:58] Kneckt: such an oppurtunity to do it too
[5:48:04] Aravarth: Hey @Towelliee , what if the Orcs on Draenor didn't drink Mannoroth's Blood? Kappa
[5:48:05] egraves7: what if there didn't always have to be a lich king
[5:48:15] Eraste: I would love to see the old cut content revisited after wrath classic
[5:48:18] CritcobainTV: I think the issue is that we've had 800 fucking timelines to play through. that's literally their fix for everything "it was a different timeline"
[5:48:19] HeBeDead: holy shit 7 years badge Pog
[5:48:31] SonofHorus82: Hot Tub Time Machine.
[5:48:31] Aidler: then you will like the new loki series. lot's of time travel
[5:48:31] Kneckt: ye
[5:48:38] DrakhanGaming: Jumper?
[5:48:39] Celestia6: Yeah the time travel stuff got weird
[5:48:39] nightwombat: 2012 Loki FTW
[5:48:43] Eraste: like if the put the WoD shatt raid in the gameplay style of tbc
[5:48:46] ARS0N1ST: Dr. Who in wow...new TARDIS mount
[5:48:47] BlueBlurPrime: I loved how they debunked timetravel movies
[5:48:57] Juggerchug: what addon do you use for the health bar?
[5:49:04] Sarole: Caverns Of Time was decent content in that regard
[5:49:05] Eraste: elvui
[5:49:08] warrenny: Scarlet crusade 2.0
[5:49:08] 91Niki: I can't wait for Loki
[5:49:09] shimwood: Scarlet Crusade takes over UC
[5:49:10] Miertez: @Eraste yep WOD with the extra raid tier
[5:49:17] VictorAvalanche: who going to pay that light bill
[5:49:21] Cyntech89: #notimetravel
[5:49:22] HeBeDead: scarlet crusdae timeline sounds interesting
[5:49:44] Celestia6: I can see them doing stuff like that again, like time travels different while we are in the shadowlands and we come back to things being weird
[5:49:51] Eraste: @Miertez ya, and would love to see a full emerald dream patch/expansion. More old god stuff (which is probably not done yet, but still) - and dragon isles, but we may also see that in 10.0 also, so who knows
[5:50:07] donol: @Towelliee if your excited for Loki time travel. The Marvel What If Series is going to blow your mind
[5:50:08] AtomicHeartSon: I genuinely think we NEED a big time skip after Shadowlands. Time to let events reset, see some MASSIVE change in the world, and things happening
[5:50:09] ARS0N1ST: also time travel...screw back to the future
[5:50:14] jigzaw2020: blizz needs to get fire Ion dude is garbage
[5:50:15] Garrujak: Well every expansion invalidates the logic of the last one. How are we supposed to fear the void when suddenly death is one of 4 zones, none of which are "rest"? How can we worship the light if even Uther is corrupted by the blue shit of dubious origin?
[5:50:15] nightwombat: 10.0 would be cool if we came back 200 years later to more of a steampunk setting. Maybe like Warhammer or something. More guns..
[5:50:21] ARS0N1ST: where are my hover boards
[5:50:22] dalaraz: we will see it in caverns in 10 years @Towelliee
[5:50:29] kusosando: What I want to see is that all of the borrowed power disappears, it doesn't come back , and we are just adventuring heroes back in Azeroth who've had some wild ride that feels like a distant dream.
[5:50:39] HeBeDead: whats to say blizzard shakes things up and completely fast forwards like a few hundred years
[5:51:03] Atruis_: I think wow needs a hard reboot
[5:51:03] kusosando: haha, I'm just all up in my TBC feels bro
[5:51:05] HeBeDead: like an new, novel timeline
[5:51:28] Kneckt: HOPE they do it

[5:51:30] Eraste: im a fan of history, so id love to see the pre sundering azeroth, rise of the elves, all that stuff
[5:51:34] dalaraz: well there are so many games to explore,wow has moved on from that years now
[5:51:41] FerociouzMonk: TO ICELAND!
[5:51:46] HeBeDead: or yeah even a few hundred years in the past?
[5:51:50] DrakhanGaming: Where did illidan go with sargeras? we should go there
[5:51:53] Keilsyar: I'd be down for WoW2.
[5:51:58] Mallaes: Iceland next expansion! üëÄ
[5:52:04] kusosando: I mean, that's what Cataclysm was and it was bad
[5:52:18] Squ1d_tv: still upset that overwatch turned into a shooter, and I'm a big shooter nerd
[5:52:18] Kahoolo: They could go and develop the areas in azeroth that havent been touched since cata
[5:52:25] delelyn: that would be emeral dream expansion kind of stuff re live all again
[5:52:27] Garrujak: Wow2 would just be a looter shooter with M+, I just want better writing for these xpacs
[5:52:30] dalaraz: cata was fine but 1 time is enough
[5:52:30] gazaway: World of Warcraft: The Wrath of the Pre-Cata Crusade
[5:52:36] Skara_XD: yep towelliee leaked it Iceland next xpac you heard it here first
[5:52:45] Aravarth: Hyjal, Vashjir, Uldum, etc
[5:52:53] Eraste: cata was still cool, flying over the zones and seeing the changes
[5:52:54] Aravarth: Twilight Highlands
[5:53:04] SonofHorus82: Questing in Uldum was the bomb diggity.
[5:53:10] Aravarth: Anal Deepholm
[5:53:12] HeBeDead: i dunno, i think "WoW2" should be  a whole new world with the same infrastructure as wow has, not some shooter
[5:53:19] HeBeDead: the mmo genre is mature, it doesnt need much iteration anymore
[5:53:32] DrakhanGaming: I think we should go to wherever illidan went after legion
[5:53:40] Eraste: WoW 40k Kappa
[5:53:42] daveyman12345: what's in background
[5:54:22] force_FMD: i love lore in wow and would play a single player lore driven game even
[5:54:25] PvtHudson093: you dont have rightous fury up
[5:54:34] SonofHorus82: @Eraste Man I would sacrifice an actual person to the Dark Gods for a 40k mmo.
[5:54:36] Eraste: by destroying sunken temple lul
[5:54:39] gazaway: The fine spectacle behind strimmer is his new Streaming Room setup
[5:54:39] xmedpakx: those zones were to also
[5:54:44] HeBeDead: i think the cata leveling experience was cool, but the endgame content didnt seem so hot
[5:54:52] Paramourn: Prot pally is so fun. I just solo'd RFC
[5:54:54] xmedpakx: i had fun redoing those zones,, they were so different
[5:55:05] kingceejay90: Chat did he post the shoes ??
[5:55:14] kingceejay90: Or did he get them yet
[5:55:27] HeBeDead: i think he just left for them?

Do that with a few different tabs for like an hour and you will know it inside and out.  It's fairly easy once you understand what its doing at a basic level.

[8:18:48] NILLme: really? where did you saw that ? @CaptainKaptn
[8:18:55] Mallaes: :V
[8:18:58] zamboneknee: Yep me
[8:19:02] SkyiTV: Guys if someone were possibly going to play a character from 0 wht would you guys considered to be good char? (on the olden days I was a shaman resto)
[8:19:03] „Éî„É≥„Éâ„É≠„Éº„É´: why would they ban that?
[8:19:15] CaptainKaptn: I nont only saw that, I experienced that myself while leveling inn Arathi
[8:19:16] SamDavidsin: advantage
[8:19:18] CaptainKaptn: 30 minutes ago
[8:19:19] Utmost777: @SkyiTV what do you want to do
[8:19:20] gazaway: They're not gonna bring wow to consoles are they..
[8:19:21] thrakan84: software input
[8:19:21] zamboneknee: So you can play with a controller
[8:19:22] HeBeDead: probably had to use a 3rd party program
[8:19:23] Lesrek: It mimics inputs, probably detected as multibox software
[8:19:29] SamDavidsin: people who use controllers can be way bettter at the game
[8:19:30] IianaDRK: yeh was gonna say ^
[8:19:30] NILLme: why? blizz added controller support so addons like this can work
[8:19:33] thrakan84: what @Lesrek said
[8:19:41] dalaraz: @RiskyBusines_ez kings is generally better yeah
[8:19:52] iyashauu: i used console port and im not banned
[8:19:52] SkyiTV: @SkyiTV I like to heal but I might be inclined to dps
[8:19:56] t_hoe17: !ui
[8:19:56] Moobot: @t_hoe17 TBC UI: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25206-TowellieesTBCClassicElvUICompilation169.html |SL UI: wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[8:19:57] HeBeDead: is he supposed to have ret aura or devo aura?
[8:20:02] Mortis301: I don't believe they'd ban that.
[8:20:13] Siddyy: buy a boost yesterday, get reported for third party software when you only use addons the day after. üò†
[8:20:15] dalaraz: you use spells not attacks @Towelliee
[8:20:16] zamboneknee: Literally writing my ban appeal now
[8:20:16] Alllprimer: need for sure
[8:20:24] Aro725: youre the only one who can wear plate anyways no?
[8:20:29] HeBeDead: walksi uses a controller LULW
[8:20:34] CaptainKaptn: As far as I know, the Console Port dev is looking into that, the Addon is officially backed by Blizzard and praised due to its impact on accessibility
[8:20:35] Siddyy: blizzard literally took my money and told me to go to hell. i'm super pissed lmao
[8:20:37] xkennenx: didnt desmesphito get keystone master using a controller?
[8:20:40] Shrenko: yes @Aro725
[8:20:43] dalaraz: it doesnt work on pala spells sadly,hit
[8:20:51] CaptainKaptn: @xkennenx he did
[8:20:53] Aravarth: Although, it's only pronounced tomato, not tomato
[8:21:00] Lesrek: If people got banned, it was almost certainly an auto ban for mimic inputs, which is against ToS now.  That said, blizz usually rectifies these things
[8:21:14] CaptainKaptn: Console Port discord is going wild ATM
[8:21:15] HeBeDead: im surprised so many people use controllers?
[8:21:47] Siddyy: i just found out console port addon and discord is being removed. so they may actually be the reason. maybe the ToS was recently changed and no warning was given. automatic ban triggered from new software? either way super dumb
[8:21:55] Aidler: if we see a drop in bots and multiboxers they got the right people
[8:22:11] SkyiTV: @SkyiTV @UtmostOwnage I like to heal but I might be inclined to dps
[8:22:14] CaptainKaptn: Playing with controller is actually really fun and relaxing - there is a small drawback even if you adapt perfectly, but it's worth it for the experience alone
[8:22:27] ZagFan590: Would be nice to see controller supported in WoW for accessibility purposes
[8:22:28] HeBeDead: MAYBE blizz is about to annoucne controller support??
[8:22:41] AtomicHeartSon: Seems like the consoleport bans MIGHT be an accident due to the multiboxing input bans, the dev is trying to talk to blizz
[8:22:52] Siddyy: @HeBeDead suspends people for 180 days just to announce their own support for controlers. super scummy LULW
[8:22:59] AtomicHeartSon: Something about Blizz acknowledges and backs the addon

[8:43:09] Paramourn: There weren't dlc etc for older games lol
[8:43:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Eternaalll they didn't continue to work on the game after it was released back then

[8:43:18] Zettabyte: @Towelliee are they storing things? Herp derp Kappa
[8:43:20] TheItalianStallion321: b/c people relate everything to WoW

[8:43:35] TheGaoSora: D:
[8:43:45] Lesrek: People forget that game prices should be about 3x what they are and DLC is basically the only reason inflation hasn't touched the video game market
[8:43:46] EKS90_: if i wanna pay 4 euro for a pack of colors in a store who cares. i rather support the devs with that then.
[8:43:47] Eraste: man no one on the internet understands basic economics they arent even worth giving the acknowledging
[8:43:47] Ninjatun4: lol they dont have to
[8:43:54] drewetling: towelliee puts on shorts we buy nair game gets made we all win
[8:43:56] Paramourn: Where I live, they play ads over the loudspeakers in Walmart & the grocery stores. We don't even get music anymore.
[8:43:59] dalaraz: everu sentence starting with "back in the day" is wrong by default
[8:44:13] HeBeDead: well they're already pricing new games at $70, its catching up
[8:44:21] Dkgungo: they hear asmon rant on how stores are bad
[8:44:33] Dkgungo: so they think stores are bad
[8:44:34] dalaraz: but asmon buys everything the stores have :p
[8:44:37] Aidler: if someone wants games like they were 15 years ago then and only then the box price would be enough
[8:44:44] Kickitnine: the clickbate vids r insane and misleading right now its just all over my youtube feed lol
[8:44:46] faulen: ahaha, no way they wait a year

[8:46:29] FalseBit: I guess nobody here has played a gacha game. Whales spend $5000+ per month on in-game purchases. WoWs microtransactions are nothing in comparison.
[8:46:53] Eternaalll: @FalseBit real whales do 5k per day LUL
[8:47:04] HeBeDead: no one disagrees that pay to win is bad, but this isnt pay to win FalseBit
[8:47:09] XshadowturkeyX: rich camble and genshin impact LUL
[8:47:21] EKS90_: yeah they said that they will do rested XP increases and accumilation of it, and also that some QoL stuff can be in the battlepass aswell, AND earnable ingame, so its just basic non P2W shit @Towelliee
[8:47:25] XshadowturkeyX: yeah rich*
[8:47:31] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee did you see that Asmon tweeted that he didnt understand why everyone was getting upset at him for using the boost and why he was being called toxic about the /spit thing. Later in that tweet chain he said he didnt think he was the target market for WoW anymore.
[8:47:32] Aidler: asmon took some hefty doses of copium to defend his boost towLul
[8:48:04] swordart_19: @SonofHorus82 so toxic streamers and hypocritic whiners who bash game which they barely plaly are not target audience .
[8:48:11] sooziecuzie: His followers are such sheep that it doesn‚Äôt even matter.
[8:48:16] faulen: The way boxed sell games should work... presale/alpha/beta to pay for initial development costs. Post launch sales to pay for dlc development...
[8:48:24] dalaraz: in the end,just dont play the game lol,stop crying for what you dont like,just avoid it ,jesus
[8:48:24] Zettabyte: @Towelliee well, it's really pay to win just buying the game, but you have the option to win or not though towLul
[8:48:27] Spritenger: you might just buy rested xo
[8:48:30] spacemarine55: Archeage had it
[8:48:44] Dkgungo: its basicly like a 100% xp boost

[8:49:02] SonofHorus82: @swordart_19 thankfully no. Maybe he'll take his army of mouthbreathers somewhere else now.
[8:49:02] FalseBit: is this about the New World drama?
[8:49:17] EKS90_: Different in a mmo tho.. if a singleplayer game? yes. not in an mmo LUL
[8:49:19] Ninjatun4: how does it work then?
[8:49:21] swordart_19: there is no drama just laughing
[8:49:22] dalaraz: well rested xp is better than straight boosting,so why are people crying
[8:49:29] Shrenko: @FalseBit they released a new tweet
[8:49:31] Aravarth: So like, in-game stores and cosmetics for purchase are just the new normal, and as long as games aren't pay-to-win, I'm fine with this
[8:49:36] swordart_19: HE KNOWS
[8:49:41] Zettabyte: SWOTOR
[8:49:50] Waspire: doesnt  even pay the electricity
[8:49:52] maccaruso: See: SWTOR
[8:49:58] Paramourn: that wouldnt even cover the servers
[8:50:05] Riear_: Check Overwatch, Pay to play, no mtx
[8:50:08] Riear_: Dead
[8:50:09] Lulaboo: SWTOR does MMO stores right
[8:50:11] Eternaalll: That wouldn't even cover the development costs lmfao
[8:50:13] RocketMan23: not only sustain the game but also to recoup the dev costs
[8:50:15] Its_Immanis: Wait, businesses exist to make money? What kind of capitalist bull is that?
[8:50:18] alkazam_gg: yeah dont forget the majority of the player base wont even buy anything in the store
[8:50:21] ginsley96: Guildwars??
[8:50:23] kingceejay90: What towel is saying is very easy to understand lol
[8:50:23] Aidler: production costs are too high and box prices are too low. too many games are out there to rise inital prices for games
[8:50:26] Zettabyte: @zCassin OW isn't a MMORPG though
[8:50:26] Nerendis: I've been alpha testing Amazon games for 7 years now @Towelliee I'
[8:50:29] Eternaalll: but then again amazon is OLD money rich,they can take a few hits kappa
[8:50:31] GCnT: The development process and costs are crazy!!! You cannot sustain the costs of an ongoing game by box sales! Let aside server, network and maintenance costs!!!
[8:50:33] Ninjatun4: path of exile?
[8:50:33] Nerendis: I'm juist glad they are release a fucking game, fuck the cost
[8:50:39] SavageCheez: even though they're FTP look at PoE
[8:50:39] TheUnknowing: guildwars is dead @ginsley96 no one plays it lol
[8:50:42] Paramourn: plus paying employees, etc
[8:50:44] Dkgungo: swtor store is basically all cosmetic and it keep the game alive
[8:50:46] DigitalChill: cmon lets get out of magic land and get back to fantasy land
[8:50:46] Nerendis: I've seen them drop litearlly 4 fully finished titles, never past Alpha
[8:50:50] swordart_19: @TheUnknowing D:
[8:50:51] spacemarine55: See T people wouldnt overract to ingame stores if the people running the stores didnt over do it EVERY TIME and start with soemthing small then expand so something huge and game breaking
[8:50:59] Zaharial: its because people only want them to break even, they dont realize that every buisness is a greedy piece of shit. which is fine its how buisness works but people dont get that profit= more development even= dead development
[8:50:59] ReinholdtRanger: Catering
[8:51:00] ReinholdtRanger: offices
[8:51:02] IZemekiSI: yeah tyhat box game would have to cost an insane amount of money
[8:51:08] dalaraz: people are so usedto subscription,that they dont understand that new world wont have 1
[8:51:10] swordart_19: INFINITE MONEY POGGERS AMAZON INFINITE MONEY
[8:51:13] Lulaboo: Paying once for a game that is supposed to last YEARS is really unrealistic because of all the maint. costs
[8:51:17] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Budget? PepeHands
[8:51:27] Waspire: yep
[8:51:38] Broomba: Box sales can‚Äôt turn a profit. You need other incentives to lure money and customers, unless you have only that game made with no additional content, expansion or dlc or shop
[8:51:45] ArroArroArro: was that wildstar?
[8:51:51] faulen: Then the store doesn't make enough money so they put more enticing things on the store...Things that actually sell. Like maybe xp bonus.
[8:52:02] kingceejay90: Hi @lulaboo towKawaii
[8:52:10] FURL_: be happy is cosmetic only.
[8:52:11] RocketMan23: and if you dont like it, hope there is a sub option
[8:52:14] dalaraz: @faulen stop asuming things,seriously
[8:52:18] Paramourn: I'm a sucker for cosmetics & player housing stuff. If ESO's stuff wasn't so expensive, I'd play that religiously
[8:52:19] Aidler: in addition. most games nowadays are online games. games 15 years ago were offline and there were 0 server costs.
[8:52:20] spacemarine55: Problem  with the stores is they are held to the share holders and like blizzard does they have to show improvments every gear which pushes the store model harder and harder and focuses on the whales in the end to do so
[8:52:23] Eternaalll: Personally if it's cosmetic mtx,i'm all for it,but not a fan of aggresive monetization.
[8:52:24] Zettabyte: in game store doesn't bother me the slightest, if i want something from it, i'll buy it. if i don't then i don't, #simple
[8:52:36] Broomba: You god father of business 101 bellular should shut his trao
[8:52:39] Broomba: Trap
[8:52:48] Eternaalll: echo chambers :D
[8:52:49] Lesrek: transmog is the real endgame of MMOIs
[8:52:50] nolorand: poe is even more expensive armor sets
[8:52:57] FalseBit: Classic Andys LUL
[8:53:00] Zettabyte: Transmog is the devil @Towelliee Kappa
[8:53:07] Exodeo_: People just need to go back to enjoying the game instead of worrying so much about side stuff
[8:53:08] spacemarine55: problem is the company wants more money then what the cosmetics give and have to push for more
[8:53:10] sharie: Given Amazon Games Track Record so far it wont survive the first Year
[8:53:20] dalaraz: people pay 15$ a month to play wow,and complain about a new game that they wont pay a sub to play,its weird
[8:53:22] DuffinStuff: Tardy to the party, what MMO is being discussed?
[8:53:24] Aravarth: I mean, people whining about cosmetics, fking League of Legends is driven almost exclusively based on cosmetics. I mean sure some people pay some money for RP to unlock champions, but I imagine like 90% of their revenues are from skins

[8:53:48] faulen: So why even make the game Buy to Play?
[8:53:56] kingceejay90: Huge legs
[8:53:59] dalaraz: @faulen you want the game free too ?
[8:54:16] faulen: sure if youre going to have a store. Make it like PoE
[8:54:21] dalaraz: no
[8:54:32] dalaraz: you do w/e you like,and whoever likes it,plays it
[8:54:37] dalaraz: poe store is  disgusting
[8:55:02] faulen: what don't you like about it?
[8:55:21] dalaraz: its not just cosmetics,it offers gaming features you cant get otherwise
[8:55:27] Paramourn: probably
[8:55:36] kingceejay90: Don‚Äôt wanna wear your Stam trinket over the carrot one ?  @towelliee
[8:55:38] casualfury: Its just supply and demand If you stop paying money for it they will stop. If you don't do anything about it they will go further with it some point.

[8:56:07] faulen: like enhanced rested XP bonuses?
[8:56:17] dalaraz: theres no enhanced rested xp in new world
[8:56:24] kingceejay90: Got you bro
[8:56:24] dalaraz: they will be sometime in thefuture
[8:56:25] Broomba: These people complaining about stores, etc in games are the ones who invested lots of $$$& in Pok√©mon cards hoping to get that 1 card or build that set to win.
[8:56:34] stressley89: diablo immortal when new world comes out
[8:56:43] Aidler: @clowncheng don't jinx it...
[8:57:07] dalaraz: and if you are comparing poe developing cost,to new world,you have no idea what you talking about
[8:57:11] Miertez: the lock monkaS
[8:57:12] faulen: those stash tabs did not initially come in the store. it was cosmetics at the start.
[8:57:14] HeBeDead: i wasnt particularly impressed with diablo immortal
[8:57:17] stallowned: need to hit that lever thing
[8:57:24] kingceejay90: Made needed to hit the lever
[8:57:27] kingceejay90: Mage**
[8:57:36] dalaraz: same goes with new world,wont have rest xp,it will come in the future
[8:57:36] kingceejay90: Or whatever he was
[8:57:38] stallowned: in the room u just pasted
[8:57:55] faulen: yeah so make it Free to Play
[8:57:58] CodyKane: you can go through that door
[8:58:08] CodyKane: and then have to double back
[8:58:11] Hibiscus602: poe is a wierd store 90% mtx 10% stash tabs.. but buy all tabs 1 time all characters on acct get em..
[8:58:27] Miertez: isnt the arena lead up to the key or thats the bar?
[8:58:28] SamDavidsin: did you just call that mage honey?
[8:58:42] dalaraz: you are weird faulen,you have  no idea how developing an mmo works vs developing an arpg
[8:58:45] Broomba: @sambodavidson no lula
[8:58:53] HeBeDead: ayyyy jimmy my man ayyyyy
[8:59:16] dalaraz: telling you want new world free to play with no sub is insane

[8:59:44] Broomba: Experts in business 101 and game development in chat today towDerp
[8:59:50] nimeon01: There are no successful MMORPGs that arent subscription based
[8:59:51] Thefingfong: @Towelliee r u planning on trying to get a naxx run in at 60?
[8:59:58] stoutside: wow you level fast
[9:00:00] Hibiscus602: there is honestly 0 to compare an arpg like Poe to any mmo currently
[9:00:06] Lulaboo: Did you guys unlock the lever?
[9:00:12] dalaraz: @clowncheng how come? oyu have any info we dont know ?
[9:00:14] Lulaboo: ahh yesh it is
[9:00:20] FURL_: new world is also backed by a multi-billion dollar company with unlimited growth in amazon.
[9:00:27] ArcaneLight: hahah LUL
[9:00:29] mikejames01: that things sold crazy
[9:00:37] Dkgungo: i bought it so i believe it
[9:00:39] ArcaneLight: its a cool weapon i'll give them that
[9:00:42] SonofHorus82: I mos def bought one of my Sith Marauder.
[9:00:42] Kahoolo: I got one and have used the Kylo hilt ever since.
[9:00:47] Eternaalll: make Audible the official stuff of NW Kappa
[9:00:50] thrakan84: Star Wars lives on its license
[9:01:03] darthbdaman: i spent a lot on loot boxes trying to get that saber
[9:01:04] Synk_live: @FURL_ It might be backed by Amazon, however Amazon has yet to prove themselves in the gaming space (they canceled their last game months after release)
[9:01:10] Kahoolo: I think the Flashpoints are pretty cool.
[9:01:23] SkyiTV: I like ESO's model for example I didn't play enough Starwars to know how it operates
[9:01:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: amazon isn't going to feed profits from their other businesses to fund a game that only makes them money at purchase
[9:01:34] HeBeDead: you can also still sub to SWTOR and get a lot of benefits
[9:01:36] clearcmos: Big 6 month ban wave currently underway on TBC Classic. Many of us just got banned for botting even though we didn't. Some people think it's related to usage of ConsolePort (an addon for using controllers). I did use that in the past for accessibility reasons. It seems to be the common link. Terrible timing with TBC launch.
[9:01:47] HeBeDead: clearcmos, yeah we heard
[9:01:59] clearcmos: @HeBeDead I hope the appeals will go through
[9:02:00] SonofHorus82: @Kahoolo love flashpoints. And Huttball is the best PVP experience of any game I've ever played.
[9:02:19] HeBeDead: clearcmos im sure they'll fix the situation
[9:02:21] Synk_live: Huttball was so damn fun, first few months of SWTOR were great
[9:02:24] dalaraz: @clowncheng why would you compare new world to wow? its not a replacement of wow,its just another game
[9:02:37] Thunderbrew: I've been running Lower Blackrock on my 59 boosted Guardian Druid. I'm having trouble holding aggro. Anyone have any suggestions?
[9:02:45] Eraste: cause people dont know how to have more than 1 game at a time danKEK
[9:03:01] Cirric_: PvE was an afterthought it aint gonna work
[9:03:07] dalaraz: @Woke_Legend :D
[9:03:08] Shrenko: @Thunderbrew start with BRD and get gear. the lvl 58 boosted gear sucks ass and even lvl 35-40 gear is better
[9:03:25] AWreal: use fire resist aura, it helps a lot
[9:03:26] KingofMeccano: its better now with pvp as you can make your own pvp arenas and have friendly games with other players
[9:03:35] swordart_19: THERE WAS CLEANSE ON CLASSIC KEKW
[9:03:36] Thunderbrew: Ok, BRD for gear. Thanks.
[9:03:41] SilkeySmooth: pvp needs to be a side event like in wow and eso
[9:03:45] swordart_19: there you got afkers/cheaters/boxers!
[9:03:50] KingofMeccano: *for swtor

[9:04:00] Shrenko: @Thunderbrew also look for gear on the auction house and there is many quests that give good gear aswell
[9:04:02] tarot_with_tricia: BRD makes me sleepy.
[9:04:40] Thunderbrew: @Shrenko Thanks. If I can't get anything in the next week or so I guess  I'll be questing for gear in TBCC
[9:04:50] dalaraz: you are confusing things i think,but its your opinion @clowncheng
[9:04:55] r_kramerz: is power leveling faster than questing still? Or is questing faster now?
[9:05:11] TheMoodyOtter: If you spin the elementals around they won‚Äôt blast your group
[9:05:30] HeBeDead: clowncheng its all based on content releases, d3 was big when their expansions came out, and poe is the same, but blizz isnt making new content for d3 otherwise they'd be competing for players
[9:05:40] Shrenko: @Thunderbrew yeah you will have a hard time to defeat enemies with boosted gear in outlands. takes like 2min just to kill a mob. but you get gear very quickly from quests in the first zone there. maybe just invite a few and do the quests togheter
[9:06:12] Kinglaughingman: Kinglaughingman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 110 months! towKawaii
[9:06:47] Thunderbrew: @Shrenko I have a group of 4 friends. We plan on questing and dungeoning together. I'm the tank  for the group

[9:08:29] Broomba: @livebountyo1 I bet it‚Äôs spam or phishing
[9:08:30] TheItalianStallion321: i dont know man....with all the keybinds and shit i have how the FUCK do you use a controller to play this game
[9:08:34] AtomicHeartSon: like 2 or 3 expansions
[9:08:34] NILLme: it lets you play with a controller, works pretty good
[9:08:35] clearcmos: it's an addon that was available on Curse and all. Allows you to map controls to a gamepad
[9:08:38] swordart_19: ALL CLASSIC PLAYERS
[9:08:42] swordart_19: then it would explain their moves!
[9:08:45] swordart_19: 5Head
[9:08:50] decib3ll: well mages press only 1 button xD
[9:08:51] clearcmos: It's useful for ppl with chronic pain or other motor issues
[9:08:54] EKS90_: accessability for people with disabilities @Towelliee
[9:09:01] michaelmm: Controllers are easier for people with some disabilities.
[9:09:03] Tighron: why would you trade more buttons for   few buttons?
[9:09:07] tadeeche: what is the jug you are drinking out of? i want one
[9:09:10] NILLme: im 100% sure that this was an unintentional ban, even some of the devs play like this :D
[9:09:14] swordart_19: Controllers is pog
[9:09:14] AtomicHeartSon: @Towelliee for some people it was because they literally couldn't play with keyboard and mouse
[9:09:17] HeBeDead: diabilities aside, how many peopel are using controllers???
[9:09:18] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[9:09:36] dalaraz: i cant believe they are banning people just for using controller,sounds insane
[9:09:39] Waspire: i have one(a controller)  plugged into my  computer for other games.   also because u can set macros  on controllers  for ease of use.
[9:09:40] Necrom93: I have essential tremor, so playing with a controller sounds pretty legit.
[9:09:44] swordart_19: Were using Controllers to multibox i bet LUL
[9:09:47] NILLme: why adding a controller support and then ban people that use it :D
[9:09:49] ARS0N1ST: you will get reported for botting automatically playing a hunter if you dont respond to people
[9:10:04] mikejames01: @ARS0N1ST lol nice
[9:10:04] clearcmos: It's probably some false-positive bullshit in their system flagging it as automation
[9:10:04] HeBeDead: fucking hunters LULW
[9:10:05] swordart_19: @deNiLLx you do not gget banned for usin controller.
[9:10:18] ARS0N1ST: i always say Ni Hao to people that accuse me
[9:10:23] Eternaalll: oh shit pally power ,been a while since i've last seen taht addon LUL
[9:10:23] michaelmm: I suspect their anti cheat software is getting a false positive.
[9:10:24] LiveBountyO1: Yeah every few minutes people are getting banned
[9:10:26] dalaraz: i mean,what is that addon acrually doing
[9:10:26] casualfury: you can use thousands of addons but not a controller LUL
[9:10:29] chummel92: Don‚Äôt ban the real bots but ban someone for using a controller lol
[9:10:33] Brodih_: just got a g600 today, it feels great in my long hands
[9:10:33] Quimby54: @ARS0N1ST you won't get banned though. If you're not botting, it doesn't matter
[9:10:33] Miertez: thats the key
[9:10:39] dalaraz: whats the addon called again?
[9:10:52] AndrewShifuVA: here's 1k gold for mistakenly banning you
[9:10:53] xideontv: is that BRD or lower BWD?
[9:11:00] swordart_19: You do not get banned for using controller
[9:11:10] swordart_19: they were using 3rd party software to control that controller which is not even addon
[9:11:11] Ballavar: NOSOUPFORYEW
[9:11:28] michaelmm: Controller support is built in now - no need for controller addons.
[9:11:29] clearcmos: @swordart_19 but many of us who were just banned in the last hour were using controllers. I can't speak for other people's playstyle, but I sure as hell wasn't botting.
[9:11:35] Aidler: maybe the api that was used was unsave and also used by many bots...

[9:11:54] HeBeDead: blood elf aoe silence LULW its too much they're too op
[9:12:05] dalaraz: seems like that addon exists for 2 years now,feels weird to suddenly banwave for it
[9:12:26] swordart_19: @clearcmos were you runningg 3rd party software controll  port ?
[9:12:32] ARS0N1ST: ironfel is walking down the ramp with the golems
[9:12:38] Lesrek: @dalaraz Likely was being used for bots as well
[9:12:40] swordart_19: @clearcmos on back gground not as addon :P
[9:12:41] nubsauce13: Ironfel is Fineous Darkvire
[9:12:53] michaelmm: Third party software that generates inputs into wow is definately against ToS. And there is built in controller support in WoW now.
[9:12:56] clearcmos: @swordart_19 yeah, WoWMapper, as instructed to run ConsolePort in Classic. So it was obviously because of that unfortunately
[9:12:59] Miertez: i think this leads to the bar
[9:13:03] dalaraz: @Lesrek yeah i guess you can automate t hings based on the usage,but thats unfair cause not everybody did that obviously
[9:13:07] swordart_19: @clearcmos see that is illegal 4Head
[9:13:29] swordart_19: @clearcmos you do not even need it to have controlelr support in game.
[9:13:36] Lesrek: @dalaraz Absolutely. My bet is they banned based on signature since it was a wave and a lot of legit people got taken in with it as well
[9:13:44] kozzdev: console port is so fun
[9:13:45] clearcmos: @swordart_19 that's too bad. I tried without it in Classic and couldn't get my controller to work
[9:14:04] Aedarax: Quick brd run 3 hours later KEKW
[9:14:07] Thunderbrew: Fun is all that matters
[9:14:08] dalaraz: yeah since it affects a lot of people,googld and reddit are on fire with people talking about it,it will get reverted
[9:14:15] Gizimoo86: brd takes long even if know route

[9:14:16] swordart_19: as far i know classic does not supoprt controller natively so there you go ask blizzard for classic native controlelr support .
[9:14:18] dalaraz: hopefuly
[9:14:34] swordart_19: @clearcmos imo you might get unban and forbidden use of that thing aggain .
[9:14:51] RUSTbomb: Anyone know if you can do paid server transfer for TBC classic ?
[9:14:54] clearcmos: @swordart_19 yeah I'll stay away from it for sure lol

[9:15:35] Miertez: this leads to the brewery but can jump down to the fire elemental
[9:15:36] nubsauce13: @Towelliee the other end of the side area where you got the new pants past the anvil where Lord Incendius (the fire elemental boss) is then there is the spiral ramps with Fineous on it
[9:15:45] PatrickTarga: hey towelieee how are ya?
[9:15:53] dalaraz: the consoleport addon creators made a post in their discord.they are apparently backed by blizzard and they are working on a solution
[9:16:05] clearcmos: good stuff
[9:16:08] Lothanis_: Par for the course in BRD haha
[9:16:09] Gizimoo86: this takes to next boss
[9:16:15] NoMoreSadness: no cow paladins in TBC DansGame üöÆ
[9:16:21] swordart_19: @RUSTbomb i believe yes
[9:16:29] dalaraz: its either it flags for the new multibox policy,or some forced latency issue
[9:17:09] Miertez: somewhere around that
[9:17:11] clearcmos: feelsbadman I was going hard at leveling with my paladin, 43 haha
[9:17:17] dalaraz: wow forums are full of people complaining about the bans apparently :p
[9:17:30] swordart_19: @dalaraz fun reading :P

[9:18:05] swordart_19: Kreygasm
[9:19:03] swordart_19: HUUUGGE
[9:19:08] dalaraz: ou can use console port to control one window and your mouse keyboard to control another. so technically it is multiboxing based on the new policy,so that prolly flagged the ban wave
[9:19:11] Artivicii: rip 60 by thursday

[9:25:37] Eraste: i tend to play them pretty deep yea, which is why im watching to see how much is in the game. looks like a lot but not sure. ill wait either way, since theres so much to play right now
[9:25:42] swordart_19: @spacemarine55 if you have longger fun and more things to do that is good
[9:25:51] Utmost777: it baffles me that people complain about the price of a game when the price hasn't changed for video games in 20 years
[9:26:21] azzurrin: SNES was 70-80 US
[9:26:22] Eraste: Don't mistake me for complaining about the price. I have no problem with the cost of games or stores lol. Just: can I get the value out of it?
[9:26:23] spacemarine55: Not not if that longer and more to do is watered down recycled crap look at biomutant that game is shit because it was hyped to hell but its a UBISOFT knockoff
[9:26:25] PimpinMuffins: !macro
[9:26:25] Artivicii: i honestly thought games would be 120+ by now
[9:26:33] azzurrin: Which was like 25+ years ago
[9:26:36] Artivicii: i remember when ps2 games were 20 and ps3 jumped to 60
[9:26:50] Dkgungo: back in the day i rented more games than i actually bought
[9:26:55] Eraste: That's how I apply value to games, nothing wrong with that
[9:26:58] Motivess: There are also 10 times as many people gaming now than back then
[9:26:58] Artivicii: same
[9:27:03] sifer007: he drop a nice shirt
[9:27:15] Artivicii: true, demand probably kept the prices stable
[9:27:20] spacemarine55: Here have a nother turtle to the water quest since you think its so engaging

[9:27:30] casualfury: back in the day I was hunting for food
[9:27:38] Miertez: isnt mc quest is behind the fire guy?
[9:28:07] Rylexthegreat: Imagine not playing the game for yourself, but go around telling people its not worth the price LUL
[9:28:16] casualfury: LUL
[9:28:43] spacemarine55: whos imagining us gamers gotta warn the others imagin being someone whos invested in a game trying to counter others trash talk on their investment

[9:54:20] GrizlyInsertion: @GrizlyInsertion Just trying to see if there are other campaigns on this character I need to do. I know I am going to keep doing dungeons, trying to get into raids and whatnot, just am not sure. I just came back to wow after a few years away.
[9:54:22] Eraste: @imbadkekw funniest? Bastion is pretty funny with how terrible it is
[9:54:38] skymercii: @imbadkekw maldraxxus is best zone
[9:55:13] Eraste: @GrizlyInsertion Ah. I'd say basically hit renown cap - run dungeons or bgs, do daily callings for that. Get a legendary or two if you want. Otherwise, you're done with your cov story until 9.1 - you can check your quest log to see if you're indeed 9/9 on the story
[9:55:19] TheItalianStallion321: he sounds so fuckin excited for raid lol
[9:55:20] D3m0nHunt3r666: skip raid Kappa
[9:55:23] Carl_JM: power nap
[9:55:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: they''ll understand
[9:55:42] Shallo1988: but do you HAVE to raid lol
[9:55:48] Eraste: mald is definitely the best, but whether youre doing threads or campaign you'll need to hit multiple zones anyway
[9:55:54] myRodex: myRodex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[9:55:54] Eraste: id avoid bastion
[9:55:56] kingmo2249: You must raid
[9:56:14] Avaricious_83: Use your trinket
[9:56:23] GrizlyInsertion: @GrizlyInsertion I am indeed finished with that. Got the achievement for it. I guess I will do that. Hit renown cap, work on my alts now as well. lol, thank you very much.
