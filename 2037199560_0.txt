[1:40:43] DumbledorSoD: what runes you using for pvp
[1:40:43] Plushie__Tv: someone in my guild was speaking about that the other day @ratslul apparently it would cause issues with the classic servers or something due to sharing same code and shizz

[1:41:21] marduxd: Whisky Streamer now? Looking for some Whiskey Sponsors?
[1:41:43] ratslul: @Plushie__Tv yea i heard the same thing but cant find the sauce
[1:42:05] Plushie__Tv: yeah i think its all speculation unless something was confirmed by a dev somewhere (reddit/twitter is my best guess)
[1:42:26] ratslul: iirc the source was from the dev but
[1:42:40] Plushie__Tv: sounds good to me, i keep the volume lower though due to ear issues

[1:45:33] Extramediums: @ratslul does it matter?
[1:45:50] ratslul: apparently im scum to some horde players lol
[1:46:48] Extramediums: and the other faction would say the same if it were swapped. Play whatever faction you want, people that get too into the whole 'x faction players are all X" take themselves too seriously

[2:07:36] Kreynz: is this druid just auto attacking and pressing starsurge on cd?

[2:11:15] aljt95: Cringe stream snipe weirdos
[2:11:15] Kreynz: do you spec into martydom? I swear it would help so much into hunters but i've never tried it
[2:11:42] Rugmouse: nobody wants a 1v1 vs a priest
[2:12:02] aljt95: Yeah nobody will 1v1 you they're scared
[2:12:12] Rugmouse: I would be LUL
[2:13:48] Kreynz: i love spamming rank 1 pain in priest vs priest 1v1s and watching them spam dispel it xd
[2:15:00] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz Its nice to cast mind blast with a pet on u
[2:15:09] Istunlocklocalpensioners: is this spec / rune setup pretty much the best for wpvp/
[2:15:11] Istunlocklocalpensioners: at the mo

[2:18:11] svettsune: op
[2:18:14] Kreynz: unless u look at how much dmg it's ticking for
[2:18:16] hypreeeeeeeee: good to see you stream again sir, much appreciated tips. keep up the stuff
[2:18:19] prodigy_wow: mousing over the buffs and debuffs is tedious
[2:19:26] Istunlocklocalpensioners: wanded.
[2:19:31] Istunlocklocalpensioners: lol
[2:19:34] perplexity: so the way to beat a boomie is be able to heal yourself
[2:19:37] perplexity: so rogues need recuperate
[2:19:51] Kreynz: does the shadow dmg wand do less dmg cause people have a lot of shadow resist?
[2:19:54] Kreynz: im using the fire wand with +5 int
[2:20:09] Istunlocklocalpensioners: haha
[2:20:15] perplexity: Suggestions List Being Sent
[2:20:20] bmkJR: phoenix wand is sooo nice to use
[2:20:20] Istunlocklocalpensioners: mutilate envenom with recuperate LUL
[2:20:28] Arjibhaji: Recuperate and leeching poison inc
[2:20:32] Istunlocklocalpensioners: everyone is gonna be fucked
[2:20:36] Istunlocklocalpensioners: rogues will rule
[2:20:38] perplexity: that's actually really cool
[2:20:48] Tryceps: rogues could use a little heal ability, nothing huge, but something
[2:20:49] Kreynz: imagine if they give rogues cloak of shadows!
[2:21:03] wheeezyp: Nah i really think they need more stun abilities personally
[2:21:05] Istunlocklocalpensioners: recuperate is gonna be more imbalanced than cloak lol
[2:21:11] Istunlocklocalpensioners: if it was anything like cata
[2:21:24] perplexity: what about cloak finisher, per combo point you remove 1 harmful magic effect on you and it has 5 min cd
[2:21:32] tyneetym: Can the shadow wand proc black out?
[2:21:35] Istunlocklocalpensioners: crimson vial would be more realistic
[2:21:45] booddhi: h eshould just go sunfire tbh
[2:21:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: just a small heal
[2:21:50] perplexity: @Istunlocklocalpensioners too retail-like imo
[2:21:52] Kreynz: what about a rune that gives you a cloak when you use vanish
[2:21:56] Kaekias: Kaekias subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 11 month streak! hydraGold
[2:22:05] Numantia: @tyneetym its not a shadow spell. Should only be on Spell's.
[2:22:07] Istunlocklocalpensioners: hmm yeah true, we don't wanna turn this into retail ol
[2:22:08] Istunlocklocalpensioners: lol
[2:22:12] perplexity: wait they can do that on retail
[2:22:15] perplexity: what happened to that game bro
[2:22:30] Kaekias: that got nerfed, no?
[2:22:43] Kreynz: that was shadowlands
[2:22:46] Kreynz: doubt it's still in the game
[2:23:21] SohnEinerHupe: i didnt know you can die from feign death.. til i saw that hc clip EleGiggle
[2:23:21] Kaekias: iirc (and don't quote me on this) think it got removed only recently
[2:23:28] Kreynz: would you prefer disperse or sfiend for priest?
[2:23:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: ggs.
[2:23:56] Mystylerocks: cannibalize him
[2:24:04] Arjibhaji: BFD fist weapon
[2:24:11] Istunlocklocalpensioners: nar you need to eat bro
[2:24:13] Istunlocklocalpensioners: heroE

[2:24:31] Istunlocklocalpensioners: nadedW
[2:24:33] Mystylerocks: Kappa
[2:24:44] Numantia: @Kreynz ooft, hard oner, but probably Sfiend, if you can combo that with homeys. shit gonna be bussin.
[2:24:44] SohnEinerHupe: all hail dr perp
[2:24:52] perplexity: hahahaha
[2:25:00] perplexity: it is actually amusing you, the fact that the timer is your oxygen
[2:25:01] Numantia: @Kreynz think the boots + disperse would be too much defensive CD as well.
[2:25:03] perplexity: amusing though*
[2:25:04] squirtlesquirt: have you messed with shadow word death/mb/twisted faith yet it’s so fun
[2:25:07] Kaekias: how does that make sense? xD
[2:25:14] Istunlocklocalpensioners: wand is so important my god
[2:25:32] perplexity: @Kaekias well if you're feigning death, you're holding your breath right (probably, never had to feign death)
[2:25:46] diamathh: If blizzard add disperce its to strong
[2:25:46] PlebTM_: @Kaekias Holding your breath for 6 min usually does that to people.
[2:25:51] perplexity: psychic horror
[2:25:52] squirtlesquirt: dot,mb,mindflay, shield, swd mb or mb swd
[2:25:55] perplexity: well its been fun guys ggs
[2:26:09] shmokes_: what are your macro?
[2:26:12] Kaekias: @Kaekias fair, haven't thought about it that way
[2:26:14] Algfader: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac And Biggie?
[2:26:18] perplexity: spectral guise would be so cool
[2:26:23] perplexity: or chastise
[2:26:41] Arjibhaji: I feel like a rune to augment a rune is unlikely re homies giving mana?
[2:26:44] perplexity: perplexity subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! fucking ads
[2:26:47] PlebTM_: If they actually give roll the bones to rogue I will be pissed. Hey just build up 5 combo points :))))
[2:27:01] Kreynz: i think in general it would make sense to make the new runes utlity instead of just more damage
[2:27:05] Kreynz: cause dmg is already going to be so high
[2:27:14] Kaekias: hydraSub

[2:30:45] Extramediums: what? no, that wasn't my question @Hydramist, "Which addon do you use to display threat on nameplates?"
[2:30:56] Extramediums: nugkey is what you use to display inputs
[2:31:02] Kreynz: if someone has engi they can almost kill them with dynamite

[3:08:57] Kreynz: 90% of premades are just trade chat randos
[3:09:00] xhosas: most pre-mades are like that tho KEKW
[3:09:17] Kreynz: u can beat them with a 5 stack of decent players pretty easily
[3:09:56] LHermite: is onlyfangs still going xd ?
[3:10:31] Kreynz: meld is good for world pvp
[3:11:19] Kreynz: it also forces them to come close for fear too tho

[3:11:55] Kreynz: u can see them from like 20 yards away
[3:12:07] Kreynz: and u still get desperate prayer

[4:06:26] JustOndore: Dude I we were talking about earlier, maybe Destro metalock is gonna be the way to go for phase2 since we get 100% crit on Ruin for the searing pain spam
[4:06:36] stanthony656: bis city
[4:07:09] Zelimeth: searing pain 42 sadge
[4:07:17] Kreynz: it would be nice if they just made gnomer drop spell rank tomes for some level 42 ranks
[4:07:25] Zelimeth: coil at 42 too, thats an oof
[4:07:25] JustOndore: Same as deathcoil. lvl 42 T_T
[4:08:05] bassiemon123: Shaman getting rank 2 chain at 40 is pritty giga
[4:08:19] JustOndore: Yeah phase 2 is gonna suck a little for us LUL
[4:08:37] Kreynz: arcane gets missiles rank at 40 so arcane in pve will be good
[4:08:56] jigsawz_ttv: is the rumor still that professions capped at 200 have you heard that
[4:09:08] Kreynz: should be 225
[4:09:34] dgrwarr: Tank shaman gonna be strong since they don’t need to go deep into enh tree to be a proper tank and will let them load up some decent ele spells
[4:09:49] Kreynz: mage is going to be disgustingly broken in bg's at 40 with fingers of frost + shatter + living bomb
[4:10:09] jigsawz_ttv: yeah it should be 225 according to the trainers ect as you can train up to 300 at 41 but ive heard with then gapping the 50 trying to slow it down
[4:10:09] jxygodx: enhance should be good at 40
[4:10:31] Kreynz: it would suck if it was 200 not 225 cause then no 8% move speed to boots enchant

[4:11:23] bassiemon123: Defilers set got a bit of movement speed wich is nice
[4:11:27] Kreynz: i'd guess 8% move speed enchant wouldn't stack with 20% move speed world buff?
[4:12:10] Kreynz: does anyone know if it stacks with ZG move speed buff? cause it would be the same thing
[4:12:13] dgrwarr: do you think penance will be as strong at 40?
[4:12:26] Caeliahgaming: Mage has been such a disappointment in P1, are they going to be any better or is it a boomkin angle again?
[4:12:48] Kreynz: penance will probably heal the same amount of % health relatively but people will have more burst and dmg in general
[4:12:52] Kreynz: to kill you when penance is oncd
[4:13:04] Kreynz: mage will be very strong at 40 yer
[4:13:06] dgrwarr: do they have enough points for PoM Pyro?

[4:17:29] Karonte88: just tuned in
[4:17:44] bassiemon123: No save it for raids
[4:17:45] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist that is the spec for 1vs1 wpvp, if u need 1% hit u remove 1 point from imp coc/permafrost/shatter
[4:17:52] fiskensfriend: from EP
[4:17:55] Kreynz: correct
[4:17:58] bassiemon123: Ooohg that im not sure of

[4:24:21] mokabear: Are you stacking for p2 on characters?
[4:24:36] jujujay_myalias: 2k exp
[4:25:02] jujujay_myalias: assuming it gives exp after the first time
[4:26:13] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist the big benefit i can think of is to rush lvls to get access to prince first. But perhaps that will be done regardless at 25 before you even start lvling
[4:26:15] Kreynz: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/mage/-055-05003230110051
[4:26:20] Kreynz: thoughts on this for bg's at 40 on mage?
[4:26:24] Kreynz: with fingers of frost + living bomb
[4:26:37] mokabear: How often can you hand that quest in? Once per weekly reset?
[4:26:41] izbull: Dude i cant waid fot Shadow in phase 2
[4:26:48] phailix: @mokabear yeah
[4:26:49] izbull: wait*
[4:27:07] mokabear: @phailix ty
[4:28:01] phailix: I still need that epic staff and I have been doing BFD every single reset since launch, havent seen it once
[4:28:17] Ben_Loz: do u think theyll give us any new rune confirmations before launch
[4:28:45] prodigy_wow: thats what i was thinking
[4:29:02] Kreynz: imagine being a mage here with imp blizzard and shatter fof living bombs!
[4:29:04] Kreynz: will be so sick
[4:29:08] prodigy_wow: i want to see some triple black outs
[4:29:38] Karonte88: but much humonculi
[4:29:44] phailix: 1 mage wiped a full raid cause it was laggy and nobody saw him come in
[4:29:46] phailix: it was funny af
[4:29:55] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist will u rush prince on launch or deal with it later
[4:29:59] Kreynz: i still have my light of elune on mage
[4:30:05] Kreynz: at some point i will use it to kill a full raid xd
[4:30:17] Racazar: what is prince?
[4:30:48] mokabear: @Racazar pvp trinket mob
[4:31:27] phailix: tidal charm, trinket that stuns for 3sec
[4:31:40] phailix: or is it 1sec?
[4:31:41] Karonte88: got alli on living flame?
[4:31:51] cynnx_crypto: when hydracoin?
[4:32:06] Ben_Loz: what are you drinking
[4:32:14] Kreynz: male nelf priest is so sick
[4:32:55] nephcs: run out of beer at 7:30 on a friday, criminal
[4:32:59] phailix: Did I dream it, or did the dev said we would be able to swap our priest racial at some point
[4:33:59] nephcs: you've time for a quick tesco run
[4:34:12] nephcs: if it's a premade > shopping trip for a refill
[4:34:15] Jutastre: watch out for pirus
[4:34:36] heyweguccinow: why is every one doing bgs just for fun or end game/tier currency?
[4:34:49] izbull: For fun
[4:34:54] Karonte88: lets see it
[4:34:57] heyweguccinow: airt
[4:34:59] mokabear: Uber Eats some in, innit
[4:34:59] tobbemrbigbone: hey i know umas boy
[4:35:00] heyweguccinow: ait ty
[4:35:03] Kreynz: it would maybe be okay if u had level 26 rank of swp xd
[4:35:06] Kreynz: oh true
[4:36:10] scroteyx: range on it is kinda bad
[4:36:46] heyweguccinow: ahahah made bg wipe for a proc Kappa
[4:36:51] Kreynz: maybe independent chance on each pain from shared pain?
[4:36:58] phailix: Feels like priest is a strong defensive pick right now, not that crazy for offense just yet. Perhaps when we get PI and shams are popping off
[4:37:23] tobbemrbigbone: inevegivup is my friend i wil fuckin ng put a piasava in your asshole
[4:37:30] ripinpeace10: ripinpeace10 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:38:05] ripinpeace10: @Hydramist are epic boots still worth geting right now on my alt for next phase
[4:39:40] scroteyx: Shared pain says its within 15yd but is that 15yds from the target or a 15yd diameter circle around the target?
[4:39:45] Kreynz: that would make sense given even at 40 the 25 boots would be op just for the on-use
[4:39:50] ripinpeace10: any idea what runes shadow will be getting ?
[4:40:13] phailix: Are resto druids good in wsg rn?
[4:40:51] phailix: so tailoring/engi gonna be BiS for next phase? Probably?
[4:41:51] ripinpeace10: have you tried swd in pvp it hits like a dump truck @Hydramist
[4:42:12] bassiemon123: I really hope they wont give engi some bs like this phase. Its fking gnomer, expecting a lot from it GoldPLZ
[4:42:39] heyweguccinow: inb4 blizz gonna give a class/spec/proff summ like removes all dmg reductions for a x amount of seconds Kappa

[4:42:57] Drunk_Mantis: death feels so good though in those fights where you can't finish their last few %hp
[4:43:19] Kreynz: imagine how hard death is going to hit with sform and all the other talent +shadow modifiers
[4:43:25] phailix: I can feel the penance nerf
[4:43:26] Kreynz: you might 1 shot yourself xd
[4:43:36] phailix: wonder if penance will scale well into lvl 40
[4:43:49] tobbemrbigbone: i like piasava
[4:43:53] scroteyx: well at least you will 1 shot the other person too
[4:44:12] Kreynz: well if u 1 shot them u wont take dmg xd
[4:44:33] phailix: could you death and then boots before you get hit tho?
[4:44:34] ripinpeace10: i hope at the end of SoD they give us wargames or arena with all the runes we will have unlocked by then @Hydramist
[4:45:44] Kreynz: even if they just give arena wargames without any rating or rewards or anything that could be cool
[4:45:50] Kreynz: it would allow the possibility for tournaments
[4:46:56] Racazar: remember 1k was the quest :p
[4:46:57] keweiy: which server
[4:47:03] phailix: you can do 10k a day with a premade

[4:49:35] phailix: Do you use any downranking at all?
[4:49:51] Shepp22: was that a 480 death?
[4:50:09] squirtlesquirt: I’ve hit 506 death twice
[4:50:28] squirtlesquirt: need to buff priests tho we are weak
[4:50:33] Kreynz: ive crit a 1.3k surge on my mage xd

[4:51:38] Kreynz: only 10 extra rep per flag cap
[4:52:03] EruhiniTV: with berserker buff @Hydramist
[4:53:25] phailix: Do you think priests will get a good way to farm gold next phase?
[4:53:44] Kreynz: mass regen has such a nice visual effect
[4:54:09] Kreynz: mage is already the king of aoe healing in pve
[4:54:16] Kreynz: just that theres not really enough dmg that demands it
[4:54:34] piouspectre: u running just a 5 man grp or can another join u

[4:55:28] phailix: you need to turn your character first

[4:56:07] phailix: can you even bind that?
[4:56:26] Drunk_Mantis: i think zeroji has a macro for it
[4:56:28] life_waste: people use 3rd party tools to do it
[4:56:28] Lotheron: mouse macro
[4:56:29] Drunk_Mantis: he uses for logoutskipping
[4:56:56] Kreynz: can't u just press W and spacebar at the same time?
[4:56:58] Kreynz: or is it not that simple
[4:57:21] jazni_23: bind jump to "-" and move forward to "=" and it will work better
[4:57:38] Joeyy_Slice: Auto hotkey
[4:57:47] jupitermama: 2 pants for homies / pom swaps are crucial in wsg
[4:58:29] jazni_23: or any other 2 keys next to eachother if it's more conveineint
[4:58:32] prointv: Hey bro. Is that fivesec rule or something else that tick your mana?
[4:58:59] xhosas: magic resist pot? casters are usless Kappa
[4:59:57] Kaekias: are mounts disabled in WSG?
[5:00:03] phailix: it's to resist pally stun
[5:00:56] jupitermama: preserve your boon at all costs in pugs
[5:01:11] prointv: thanks mate
[5:01:16] Kreynz: it would be cool if the ashenvale mount worked in wsg tbh
[5:01:38] phailix: @prointv what was the answer?
[5:02:15] Kreynz: you dont even have a hunter or a mage :(
[5:02:16] Kreynz: no damage
[5:03:04] Kreynz: not very hard to get it either
[5:03:05] prodigy_wow: and its so easy to get now

[6:00:53] jarlo123: classic was a lot about hard casting
[6:00:58] jarlo123: all these insta spells fuck it
[6:01:05] Kreynz: they could have balanced pom in wsg a bit better by giving pom a cast time
[6:01:30] Kreynz: and making penance a 3 sec channel instead of 2
[6:01:37] Kreynz: wouldn't really impact pve much
[6:01:46] jarlo123: people wanna nerf starsurge when penance is insane

[6:03:17] Kreynz: why is it instant cast in sod

[6:03:56] Aryranth: @Hydramist How the hell does a warlock beat a priest? I cant seem too. It seems unwinnable
[6:04:04] Kreynz: at the very least penance should be a 3 sec channel not 2

[8:02:11] spudink: you know its serious when they have to wear gloves
[8:02:18] Frig0z: this is why we need the retail map Kappa
[8:02:45] wheeezyp: "if you need a heal just come over here"
[8:03:14] aljt95: fc needs to lure them over to you
[8:03:52] aljt95: ez
[8:05:15] Sinostra: it's only 11pm :(
[8:05:27] schandri: wish we had an idea what runes we get in phase 2
[8:05:27] cajli: u think racials will be obtainable on diffrent races for priests next phase?
[8:05:42] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[8:06:08] schandri: i think its difficult to make a tierlist without knowing what runes we get for each class
[8:06:11] vrsswow: Yea but create List and go 1 by 1 class
[8:06:23] Sinostra: and when are we doing this list ?
[8:06:38] Sinostra: nice
[8:07:15] vrsswow: Create tier list and go by each class healers
[8:08:12] schandri: pvp tierlist is gonna be shadowpriest stier with shadowform for sure
[8:08:56] bumaftw: are you going respec to shadow on p2?
[8:10:24] Sinostra: and let's talk about every class' brain while we're at it :P
[8:10:26] schandri: i mean.. what is gonna beat a shadowpriest. like literally nothing in lvl 40
[8:10:31] schandri: warlock have a chance
[8:10:43] Toxiferous: everyone beats shadow priest when they go oom
[8:10:47] Toxiferous: after 3 spells
[8:11:32] schandri: but you ar e dead before they go oom unless you are a warlock
[8:11:45] bumaftw: we can't know shit yet
[8:12:10] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @Toxiferous if they get vampiric touch as next rune, everyone is dead
[8:12:15] Sinostra: that list will have to assume no new rune comes out in p2
[8:12:39] Mystylerocks: tyty ryan
[8:13:39] schandri: belt runes is comming i think.. howling blast and 2 other spells were leaked for paladin. but it could be early development
[8:14:07] schandri: its in the early sod video 1 month before it came out
[8:14:10] schandri: the teaser
[8:14:27] Sinostra: @schandri might've been placeholder
[8:14:35] schandri: augmented judgement, howling blast and something else
[8:15:04] Sinostra: howling blast is a dk spell, makes no sense on a pal
[8:16:01] schandri: might have been placeholder.. but it was there
[8:16:29] Sinostra: yeah, but i wouldn't pay too much attention to that
[8:20:30] SnotBoogey: jammers
[8:22:04] sulltan95: @hydramist how good is the holy shroud helm? i bought it off my friend today
[8:22:26] sulltan95: its for lvl 27
[8:22:39] damare91: what type of PVP is there in SOD ?
[8:22:44] damare91: only Outdoor pvp ?
[8:23:08] sulltan95: i bought it to prepare for next phase
[8:23:12] sulltan95: 25g
[8:24:15] sulltan95: for me it depends which char i am maining for next phase , i have pala / priest
[8:24:20] sulltan95: depends on runes tbh
[8:24:32] sulltan95: hopefully we get leaks soonish
[8:26:43] sulltan95: i wish that too it would make it waaay enjoyable but what if i level my priest to 40 and runes are bad
[8:26:57] sulltan95: and i have to switch pala
[8:27:12] wowiskindabad: warr needs shockwave
[8:27:44] alanzyr: @wowiskindabad no they don't
[8:28:06] vrsswow: Like hunter they get nerfd and nerft and still top dps class
[8:28:07] sulltan95: i think if they add void tendrils to our kit same as pandaria then we are unstoppable
[8:28:15] wowiskindabad: most fun ability ever tho on an arms warr
[8:28:20] sulltan95: i wish we get a stun or a root somehow
[8:28:37] frostone1: i want cos for rogues
[8:28:43] sulltan95: ultimate penance maybe?
[8:28:49] sulltan95: would be nice also
[8:28:53] Sinostra: so what does priest get exactly at 40 ?
[8:29:37] sulltan95: yeah please show us whats ur talents in 40 would look like as shadow and disc
[8:30:01] hedrane04: sform :D
[8:30:07] xhosas: i think warrior lvl 40 is the best
[8:32:52] xhosas: prayer rank 2 tho Kappa

[8:38:36] NormanBates420: @sulltan95 i highly doubt he "forgot" about pi
[8:39:13] sulltan95: i would drop blackout for inner focus tho for more armor against melees
[8:39:52] zandire: blackout is massive
