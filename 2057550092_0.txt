[9:24:21] relmo: this really shows why he gets boosted
[9:24:27] watchmenaethan: maybe if you rp with a deep country accent people would respect you more
[9:24:33] p1nguinbro: @5L4Y3R "now u can focus on wow" "kek I made him angy"... "wait but literally please switch convo"... "its been 10 minutes hes still on gta"... "oh no please dont ban me"
[9:24:44] trepthetrapdad: I bet those gangbangers didn't even give cam shit of that 100k kek
[9:24:45] cclusii: there arent any hype moments
[9:24:50] 5L4Y3R: @5L4Y3R SCHIZO
[9:25:02] jaxtingsyou: I love the Buddha and X banter it’s great
[9:25:33] relmo: maybe if you didn't self insert rp people would respect you more
[9:25:41] 5L4Y3R: ^^
[9:25:47] p1nguinbro: @5L4Y3R Aware now im schizo apparently...

[9:26:13] trepthetrapdad: He got roasted too hard probably went and cried
[9:26:14] fyisic: what message?
[9:26:14] masteroogwayx21: half the server is self-inserts , there few people like Burn who actually RPs
[9:26:17] bamboniiii: he probably said that just so he felt better and left the stream lol he dont wanna know what you're thinking
[9:26:21] 5L4Y3R: yep
[9:26:31] Galoots_: probs
[9:26:41] 5L4Y3R: om

[9:26:53] BerkTheLUL: fuck him LULE
[9:26:55] trepthetrapdad: chat after that was great kek
[9:26:56] M1sterRZ: Genuinely LUL
[9:26:59] bamboniiii: my ex used to say "genuinely" when she was being toxic and petty forreal lol
[9:26:59] 5L4Y3R: @Kerminal it's on sight
[9:27:02] silan: eww
[9:27:03] Kerminal: om
[9:27:05] Kerminal: YALL NUTS
[9:27:09] dduxxx: lmaoooo rolled

[9:27:31] Kerminal: your ooc mad tho?
[9:27:34] djanik31: DRAMA ALERT
[9:27:42] jujuafb: if hes really sorry why would he unfollow OMEGALUL
[9:27:50] Egyptian_Joe: hes a punk
[9:27:50] sabsab4: Exactly, RP is suppsoe to be about how to make it fun for everyone.
[9:27:51] dduxxx: you mad IRL about this?
[9:27:55] relmo: it's wild the guy that got banned for loot box ocean dumping is saying this with a straight face
[9:27:56] Kerminal: OOC on both sides holyyyy
[9:27:59] Kerminal: unfollowed dang
[9:28:01] p1nguinbro: @bamboniiii Now all the toxic boys say "genuinely tweaking" tiktok and xqc falls out of his chait in laughter. Happened like 2 weeks ago do you want me to share the tiktok?
[9:28:01] 5L4Y3R: tastefulness? he ruined the entire content for 3 streamers
[9:28:05] djanik31: bro you gotta ocean dump him dont let him get away with it
[9:28:07] 5L4Y3R: for ever
[9:28:12] 5L4Y3R: killed the squad
[9:28:14] 5L4Y3R: back to wo
[9:28:15] djanik31: he talked to half the city after making up bs
[9:28:16] Thomsan04: @Kerminal the entire situation has been OOC on both sides
[9:28:19] masteroogwayx21: robbing ppl inside a bank should not be thing
[9:28:26] MainlyHigh: I mean I think gta rp is bound to leak to ooc drama
[9:28:28] 5L4Y3R: grayFinger
[9:28:30] silan: he unfollowed? cringe KEKW
[9:28:31] bigsteve1015: bro we were spamming chat saying fuck that guy ocean dump him, Troden was the only one on his side and TRODEN HATES YOU
[9:28:32] 5L4Y3R: fuck him
[9:28:34] usedxsoul: There are 2 things in this world, Garry getting grayscreened, and garry getting finesed for money/gold.
[9:28:37] ItsPhrost: whats fastest way from 20 to 26 rn
[9:28:48] M1sterRZ: So when is the court?
[9:28:50] Kerminal: @Graycen look man as someone whos rp'd for a long time and owns a server. This is a cycle and the goal is to minimize ooc drama imo. I see this more times than you could count. Hope yall make up.
[9:28:52] bigsteve1015: prior to your scam
[9:29:02] Hudman73: stockades
[9:29:02] ItsPhrost: Sadge
[9:29:04] p1nguinbro: sorry I wasnt trying to take the flooe @bamboniiii . Having rude gf sounds abusive. Good luck dude.
[9:29:15] fyisic: best to just avoid him. If you do anything in RP it will be ooc as well
[9:29:16] Tony2362: not only that but it might have saved the group if you would have been able to get a trailer set up before you took your wow break now people probalby just gonna do their own thing
[9:29:27] alisoninaisle10: Sadge graycen drama
[9:29:32] jujuafb: do stocks 24-28 ResidentSleeper
[9:29:36] Cdenzy: wtf is ooc
[9:29:36] alisoninaisle10: you hate to see it SadCat
[9:29:38] Thomsan04: @Graycen we can just RP on a palworld server. team magma vs  team aqua arc
[9:29:48] Kerminal: @Thomsan04 ZANG NOW THATS AN IDEA
[9:29:53] zMalloc: pass
[9:29:55] Tony2362: p
[9:29:55] BerkTheLUL: p
[9:29:56] Thedruidtyler: P
[9:29:58] Kerminal: p
[9:29:59] Kerminal: pushin
[9:30:00] Galoots_: P
[9:30:01] Neonbonkers: p
[9:30:01] Thomsan04: p
[9:30:02] usedxsoul: P
[9:30:03] silan: p
[9:30:04] jujuafb: p
[9:30:08] M1sterRZ: Pushing p
[9:30:10] alisoninaisle10: i heard that mizkif hates graycen as well SAJ
[9:30:17] 5L4Y3R: little child crying about democracy
[9:30:21] 5L4Y3R: cause he got voted against
[9:30:24] sabsab4: People need to remember rp isn't like WOW, it's not something you can win.
[9:30:26] Thedruidtyler: they're saying P for pussy or pass but realistically pussy
[9:30:29] 5L4Y3R: kerm obviously did not watch
[9:30:31] usedxsoul: Its GTA and RP lmao.. do you even know the game you are RPing in???
[9:30:48] bamboniiii: we can all agree that when it happened @Graycen butthole got sweaty
[9:30:56] certtifiedg: bro slowest lvler
[9:31:17] usedxsoul: Who wouldda thought a game that was based around stealing would have a thief Kappa
[9:31:20] Cdenzy: What happened
[9:31:21] Kerminal: I watched some of it (sorry hadd to clip to hear ur question) but I don't really have full context to be honest. The context I have is mostly from your side and bean watching. I agree uh it can def make u feel some type of way. I don't slight u at all for feeling some way.
[9:31:24] relmo: is he trolling us
[9:31:31] Anckael: "Guys this is different because it happened to me"
[9:31:42] relmo: "Guys this is different because it happened to me"
[9:31:45] piro_d: @Graycen what if you did IRL streams and RP'd IRL? NOWAY
[9:31:49] cowill93: no solo
[9:31:52] Thomsan04: this was cam OOC not liking that he got pushed outta the group for multiple arguments with people
[9:31:52] cowill93: trio mage
[9:31:56] xblasphemye: yo loot
[9:32:09] 5L4Y3R: @Thomsan04 yeah he's been selling shit and hiding it since before that too tho
[9:32:12] certtifiedg: nobody cares about joker fk that p boy
[9:32:14] xblasphemye: nah ur good
[9:32:31] 5L4Y3R: he was a horrible rper cause he just wanted to grind and leave with his money so he could start capstone whatever the fuck that is
[9:32:34] Kerminal: I'll be straight up though, be careful with nopixel, they do not favor giving other people flack on streams. They've been known to just yeet/deletus people that they deem firestarters.
[9:32:45] relmo: I mean shit I get pissed off playing normal games. I can understand it being worse in RP
[9:32:49] Kerminal: otherwise fun place :D
[9:32:58] Fakomi: To play devil's advocate, it's not like your money is gone for good. As shit as the rp was there are always ways to fix it with even more rp. Like how The Union got their shit back after the house robbery. I think the only scummy part about it was him doing it knowing you were going to leave the city for a while.
[9:33:03] Kerminal: yep never direct people at him :D
[9:33:07] Kerminal: twitch tos
[9:33:08] Kerminal: of course
[9:33:09] 5L4Y3R: what is reddit gonna do
[9:33:10] xblasphemye: I will say who cares about leveling solo super fast when you can grind with mcconnell and friends.
[9:33:11] 5L4Y3R: not shit
[9:33:14] 5L4Y3R: fuck nopixel
[9:33:19] Kerminal: im just lookin out for you 4Shrug
[9:33:36] usedxsoul: Can you speak your mind on the mitch and mizkif drama
[9:33:38] Kerminal: 140k after a wipe like that is huge, i hope theres some uppers looking into it
[9:33:48] caleb_thewhitehand: the chill and relax scroll
[9:33:54] 5L4Y3R: @Kerminal he's not gonna play rp again lol
[9:33:58] caleb_thewhitehand: that scroll is big for erpers @Graycen
[9:34:00] 5L4Y3R: some new game will come out in 2 weeks
[9:34:01] fatlittlepaypig: a guild already beat gnomer LUL
[9:34:04] BerkTheLUL: yeah man im super chilling
[9:34:04] 5L4Y3R: and that will be the new variety
[9:34:06] 5L4Y3R: after sod
[9:34:06] sabsab4: There us a huge difference between being a criminal and intentionally screwing people over.
[9:34:26] relmo: SM boosting streams for the next 2 months getting his alts up to raid
[9:34:34] Kerminal: @5L4Y3R I'll be completely honest- being a streamer in the RP scene is cut throat. Not in a term of "some people can't make it" but in terms of toxicity and being so roped into something and then having it severed. He may return to it sometime or even elsewhere if he really had fun.
[9:34:41] jujuafb: POGGERS
[9:34:47] Nightbot: Follow my twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/graycen
[9:35:03] Kerminal: RP can be a great thing, but when streams and numbers and big stuff get involved.. it gets super super toxxic.
[9:35:07] Kerminal: imo
[9:35:08] 5L4Y3R: the entire 3 days was so toxic and bad rp
[9:35:14] 5L4Y3R: for everyone in your group
[9:35:16] 5L4Y3R: all caused by cam
[9:35:21] jujuafb: i went from 28-31 no improved fort or shadowfiend ResidentSleeper
[9:35:24] Kerminal: good rp and bad rp are also subjective. Every person, group and server are different.
[9:35:29] dduxxx: how would you handle gettin kicked if you were cam?
[9:35:30] Nightbot: Please check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/GraycenTV

[9:35:36] Kerminal: Every stream perceives a situation differently
[9:35:40] 5L4Y3R: he literally 10x his viewers

[9:36:26] jrat: @jujuafb oda
[9:36:33] alisoninaisle10: more beef Sadge
[9:36:36] cclusii: rp in general is cringe
[9:36:38] 5L4Y3R: i think you guys all deserved it for putting up with cam that long
[9:36:39] alisoninaisle10: brandon 4Love
[9:36:39] sepph_: cuh
[9:36:43] jujuafb: oda
[9:36:46] 5L4Y3R: it was insane how you treated chat during those days
[9:36:46] alisoninaisle10: oda
[9:36:51] piro_d: (door_knock) spongebob: Who’s there? (door_open) (door_close) (krabs) Mister Krabs, what are you doing? (slow_clap) o! o! o! o! o! (slow_clap) o! o! o! o! o! o! o! o! o! o!

[9:37:04] Makki10: 1G g glizzyL
[9:37:07] Fakomi: But like I said the scummiest part imo was  him doing it knowing you were going to leave the city for a while the next day kek
[9:37:09] alisoninaisle10: SAJ
[9:37:10] silan: SAJ
[9:37:13] piro_d: SAJ
[9:37:17] merlygood_: SAJ
[9:37:20] Kerminal: @Graycen I can't promise streamers galore or streamer bennies, but if you ever wanna try it out somewhere offstream or something on a fresh plate let me know my shits been around a long time and we have a queue every day so theres people to interact with. Hopefully you'll give RP another shot regardless of where or when.
[9:37:23] 5L4Y3R: the robbery we all saw coming juggs warned you
[9:37:25] 5L4Y3R: that he would do that
[9:37:26] relmo: cam squad
[9:37:29] 5L4Y3R: you are delusional
[9:37:35] 5L4Y3R: it was bad before that already
[9:37:58] 5L4Y3R: OK
[9:38:03] xblasphemye: I was going to RP until i realized I had to pay like 30 bucks to maybe get in
[9:38:03] Kerminal: WOWISBACKBABY
[9:38:11] Kerminal: @xblasphemye there are other places you can play
[9:38:14] 5L4Y3R: @xblasphemye you will not get in with that tier
[9:38:18] 5L4Y3R: you ahve to pay $500 a month
[9:38:22] Egyptian_Joe: From the first second I saw him on your stream he acted like a douche so 4Shrug
[9:38:22] Kerminal: I do yes
[9:38:22] Fakomi: @xblasphemye 30 bucks to have the snipe queues in the PUBLIC server kek
[9:38:24] 5L4Y3R: yeah you can rp on a good servber
[9:38:27] 5L4Y3R: nopixel is just trash
[9:38:32] chilemangx: kermit: ITS SOD TIME BABY, GUP GUP IS BACK BABY, BABY BACK RIBS BABY, HOT GNOME FIRE MAGE BABY!
[9:38:46] Kerminal: do u want me to plug it graycen or

[9:38:53] 5L4Y3R: SLORPGLORPIN
[9:38:53] M1sterRZ: Adam: The weakest leadership of the history after Neville Chamberlain's prime ministry of the great britain against the nazi germany is considered to be Garry's leadership of cam squad against Camron.
[9:38:54] 5L4Y3R: so sick
[9:38:55] Kerminal: id suggest just looking for custom coded places that are semi big 4Shrug
[9:39:02] GrandmasCloset: i get bad vibes from that server man
[9:39:06] 5L4Y3R: banned lenny and steven but so sick
[9:39:08] 5L4Y3R: W management
[9:39:12] 5L4Y3R: we love nopixel beansChesting
[9:39:21] sighwarlock: oh thank god im still higher level than this guy KEKW

[9:39:30] 5L4Y3R: kerm how much is your monthly payment
[9:39:31] Kerminal: theres 210 with 30 + in queue at 5pm EST and on
[9:39:31] thorzain_22: Where's my points refund wtf l Gary
[9:39:38] ItsBorland: @graycen we thinking fire or frost pump age at 40

[9:39:50] ItsBorland: agreed
[9:39:55] nebby1122233: MCONNEL
[9:40:29] evanskies: to get into nopixel you need to apply when its not popular
[9:40:38] dduxxx: @kerminal v cool congrats on that
[9:40:53] Fakomi: it's 30$ for the shittiest prio in the NP public server. You can't even pay to enter the main server right now kek
[9:41:09] dammitcyrus: Feral = Fast groups for melee cleave
[9:41:12] Kerminal: @Fakomi Or play on another server that has a custom framework and isn't copy pasta/money grab
[9:41:26] gay_fish69: buttsoapsWorking buttsoapsWorking buttsoapsWorking
[9:41:32] bamboniiii: Damn I'm amazed I only got to lvl 29 and I'm giving up
[9:41:40] kodouka: yea i play on no pixel public blue
[9:42:00] thorzain_22: Paying money to play with Gary guppers in GTA RP would warrant a psychiatric evaluation
[9:42:23] xblasphemye: @Fakomi thats wild. I was this close to actaally joining
[9:42:33] Thedruidtyler: old graycen would do a 24h stream to celebrate classic launch
[9:42:34] bamboniiii: ILL KEEP GOING IF YOU DO THE 24 STREAM LIKE A REAL MAN. @graycen
[9:42:51] Kerminal: kermit: If you are looking for a good custom coded from the ground up roleplay server that has it's own unique features, foundation and large community. Join Production RP dot org. Whitelist server only, 210 and a queue after 5 pm est daily.
[9:42:52] dammitcyrus: you dont got streamers on it so thats nice
[9:42:55] Kerminal: shameless plug :)

[9:44:05] cbusbb: SOY MAGE POV OOOO

I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago, and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know -- that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives; and my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
[10:02:15] Galoots_: oda
