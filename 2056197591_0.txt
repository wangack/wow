[0:19:58] Brocksley: that time where he killed it before it even ticked
[0:20:01] shredder1111: spectator UI might just be shit at showing totems, delayed etc
[0:20:14] teeths121: is the brackets up yet?
[0:20:22] Swishinn: ive done that shit to a link before and im hardstuck 2500

[0:21:02] EFFSIN: did u look at the hero talent article ?
[0:21:19] RealApexPredator: I dont think under any circumstance they were cheating but holy fuck the speed of link kills was actually bot worthy
[0:21:22] Malte_L: YO chuck gl for later
[0:21:26] DentalDayum: @tinkertowns maybe they just need some short immunities on them

[0:22:01] RealApexPredator: they made totem killing bots based on wiz and pika
[0:22:21] FullyMetalz: Cdew.... what we saying that Warrior is the next expansion broken class favourite? I reckon it will be. Warrs been kinda sucky for some time now... blizz will be thinking its time to give them their 15 minutes of flavour. Also, next expansion is about War..

[0:23:36] RealXrave: seems like warr/dk mains are all playing dh now
[0:23:54] FullyMetalz: 100% will be @zacaree55 blizz loves their lore class shit... next expansion is literally about war and fighting and destruction... Warriors will be the xpac favourite. Just you wait.
