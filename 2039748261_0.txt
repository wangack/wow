[0:07:13] jacob_the_mage: ven I play BM and I am stuck 1900... I feel like I spread defensives well and land traps... idk what I am doing wrong :(
[0:07:16] ryanblue98: I wonder how high ven could get on a blood dk in Solo shuffle LUL
[0:07:25] Badasti: the only melee it really affects are warriors which already struggle into mages XD
[0:07:31] Eyetol: locks for ssure
[0:07:45] dooshken: idk but I was watching cdew, mes, and trill saying the change was cooked so I figured I'd ask for another opinion haha
[0:07:47] kittarie: hello happy Sunday !
[0:07:51] Dwilk20: I did the armor math on Arms warrior and it was an increase in 10% damage taken from physical I didnt do the Cloth math
[0:07:55] enviscerate: dont warriors lose str too from losing armor
[0:07:57] nikthevoker: LUL my dog was so cold i looked over and she went on my bed under the blankets
[0:08:06] passdafroot: how’s season 4 so far?!
[0:08:15] chrye_xx: I don’t understand 30% to 3#
[0:08:21] chrye_xx: 3%**
[0:08:44] PuffnTuff: PuffnTuff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! <3
[0:08:51] passdafroot: hunters look like they pump so hard rn omfg lol
[0:09:05] Copiumgold: hunters everywhere
[0:09:28] Exitlifez: hunters def arent meta and are like b tier
[0:09:48] Badasti: @Exitlifez idk bm has seemed pretty good to me
[0:09:52] aceofspades_80: more pillar?
[0:09:53] passdafroot: super close on the save there!
[0:09:56] nitepotion: @chrye_xx 30% armor buff, my priest has 11% damage reduc due to armor, 30% of 11% is like 3.5%
[0:10:06] passdafroot: what mmr is this?
[0:10:09] Exitlifez: Bm is only good cuz tranq darts can mess up druid
[0:10:12] kittarie: I’m slowly trying pvp, this morning got /slapped and had strange gestures made at me several times LUL
[0:10:26] kittarie: good times lmao
[0:10:34] chrye_xx: ohhh that makes so much more sense lol thank you @nitepotion
[0:10:36] nikthevoker: that person is prolly chat muted
[0:10:58] Badasti: @kittarie dont worry that pretty much never goes away. Just look on in fascination
[0:11:27] nerdyorc_: hey ven how you doing
[0:12:03] kittarie: @badasti noted !
[0:12:30] nikthevoker: just had a 1900 lobby, hpal walked in and died insta every round, i asked if he had bubble, he walked in nand bubbled then died every round after LUL
[0:12:38] passdafroot: ooooo double lock will be interesting
[0:12:47] chrye_xx: did he have port
[0:12:52] universe352: there is no way to win 2vs3?
[0:13:06] Exitlifez: i swear in shuffle lock ports cd is increased  by 30 seconds LUL
[0:13:08] passdafroot: @universe2788 there totally is
[0:13:45] QuonDot: Good evening ven and company rukiBuddy duckJam
[0:13:51] universe352: @passdafroot why it ends right after one hero dies
[0:14:15] dooshken: I just asked cause trill, mes, and cdew were saying the armor change seems cooked so I figured I'd ask you too @venruki
[0:14:19] Arubicon: nice win Ven
[0:14:24] chrye_xx: there goes another stupid DH
[0:14:31] passdafroot: @universe2788 ahh in this game mode called Solo Shuffle it will automatically end when someone goes down. but in regular 3v3s it goes until the whole team goes down
[0:14:34] chrye_xx: ran over to you for absolutely no reason
[0:14:50] passdafroot: @venruki agreed!
[0:14:55] passdafroot: especially in this meta
[0:15:27] PuffnTuff: i think its going to hurt plate more then it will help cloth, since plate armor numbers are much higher than cloths.
[0:15:43] Badasti: imo armour is one of those outdated concepts like druids being immune to poly
[0:15:46] that_man_ski: that_man_ski subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! My warlock cannot wait til tuesday!
[0:15:48] chrye_xx: yes Dh is being dh
[0:15:59] chrye_xx: they need to nerf Dh to the ground
[0:16:17] dooshken: Yea I guess that seems fair
[0:16:20] Arubicon: dont hate..go play a DH
[0:16:43] chrye_xx: I like classes that make me use my brain
[0:16:54] aarongarey1993: Yooooooo my bruvva
[0:16:57] heavymetal_warrior: Good morning from down under!
[0:17:01] passdafroot: oooo nice win
[0:17:10] Arubicon: not you..chat
[0:17:13] nerdyorc_: I am hating
[0:17:20] jacob_the_mage: DH warlock gonna be the meta on tuesday
[0:17:25] passdafroot: @venruki how you doing today?
[0:17:36] Lemdul81: nah.  no reason for dh to do as much damage as they do with all the rest of their kit
[0:17:47] Lemdul81: either kill the kit or the damage
[0:17:49] Badasti: @Arubicon i actually did roll one, full greens and I feel borderline unkillable and can still top dam with fully geared people XD
[0:18:29] nerdyorc_: the most wild change is the fear change
[0:19:04] zachgamegodx: holy shit that's the face of a gamer
[0:19:32] supatease: Venruki and aegis are related and u cant tell me they arent
[0:19:41] supatease: They are literally twins
[0:19:46] zachgamegodx: what happened
[0:19:47] zachgamegodx: ok nvm
[0:19:48] zachgamegodx: sorry
[0:19:58] andreadisaa: will u play any monk today ?
[0:20:00] kittarie: something you are or ?
[0:20:04] klittconny: Aegis is 15 years younger
[0:20:16] jacob_the_mage: aeghis 30 years younger
[0:20:19] slummin36: ggs man, i was the sv hunt. glad youre enjoying hpal
[0:20:20] dooshken: mid 20s
[0:20:21] jontepman: happy to see you live, I thought you are off Sundays
[0:20:23] chrye_xx: I’ve started to check PvP every Dh in my lobby at 2.1-2.2 mmr.. almost all of them aren’t better than rival on any other class in the game
[0:20:24] kittarie: oh sorry something you are or no ? that made you sick
[0:20:25] klittconny: You are that old!
[0:20:27] supatease: Venruki has anti aging tech
[0:20:33] TrillOGtv: how old is ven ? 38 ?
[0:20:40] jacob_the_mage: ven getting some silver streaks in his hair
[0:20:41] kittarie: ate omg
[0:20:45] R0NGG: wow ven is 40? rukiGrin
[0:20:45] Badasti: what Aeghis he? LUL
[0:20:47] laptopgamerx69: hello venruki big fan here! was just wondering what are your thoughts on ziqo?
[0:20:55] supatease: There was a really bad step throat strain
[0:21:07] Alexxhaal: Monk stream or i will keep watching
[0:21:10] dooshken: scary
[0:21:13] Badasti: damn bro thats intense
[0:21:14] zachgamegodx: what the f
[0:21:16] IamWalnuts: low blood pressure?
[0:21:17] kittarie: oh no.. crap ! and you were just sick
[0:21:18] universe352: do you drink alcool?
[0:21:21] aarongarey1993: Did you see a doctor?
[0:21:24] klittconny: Longhaired stud venruki will always be missed
[0:21:25] zachgamegodx: are u having any rapid weather changes near u?
[0:21:26] chrye_xx: that sounds like you need to go to the doctor brother
[0:21:27] Alexxhaal: damn
[0:21:32] jacob_the_mage: I had covid 3 weeks ago and it made me super dizzy
[0:21:33] supatease: Was it heart related
[0:21:37] Badasti: probably all that stress and concentration from playing demon hunter
[0:21:46] slummin36: ibuprofen and tylenol reduce fevers
[0:21:46] Symo85: @Badasti :D
[0:21:47] supatease: No chest pains
[0:21:48] ryanblue98: sounds like a wicked fart released
[0:21:52] jayyArrington: hmmm whats ya take on WW?
[0:21:57] kittarie: that’s unsettling to faint though
[0:22:01] lunasoul1: covid 100%
[0:22:05] Tiradon34: is there any other 3s comp for boomys then boomy/dh?
[0:22:07] kittarie: glad you are feeling better now
[0:22:21] jacob_the_mage: funnest DPS to play in shuffle atm
[0:22:25] jacob_the_mage: ?
[0:22:26] universe352: damn covid or vacins
[0:22:26] whoowhat: dehydration?
[0:22:29] IamWalnuts: sounds like either dehydration or low blood pressure
[0:22:31] zachgamegodx: you said that u were having issues sleeping while breathing thru your nose, it could be sleep apnea no?
[0:22:36] PuffnTuff: a plate chest has like 1600+ armor, where as cloth chest is like 400. so cloth wont feel much tankier, where as plate will get a huge hit to armor
[0:22:38] zachgamegodx: and it was something related
[0:22:44] aarongarey1993: Move out the way lads. I'm a doctor let me give venruki the kiss of life
[0:22:48] dooshken: good rest at least lol
[0:23:02] zachgamegodx: keep drinking that wata ven
[0:23:06] Duides: excited for plate nerfs?
[0:23:28] volanto: now hpal squish
[0:23:31] Xeruz: high or low bloodsugar can cause dizziness or even feint
[0:23:33] YoMamaSoFine69: why do healer queues take so long atm?
[0:23:33] zachgamegodx: Ven was a big proponent of armor normalization
[0:23:33] kreyzy8: why did rsham armor get nerfed but not ele lol
[0:23:34] chrye_xx: why rsham nerf? that made zero sense
[0:23:52] Duides: Well, I main MM, so those two changes to cloth and plate seem just perfect LUL
[0:23:58] whitra91: finally my monk can melt warriora DAESuppy but the armor nerf is dps nerf for warrior no?
[0:24:06] kuba_2615: best healer for demo Tuesday? :D
[0:24:09] baxter5569: BM hunters are gonna shred ppl XD
[0:24:17] slummin36: excited for the 4% sv buff
[0:24:18] kreyzy8: mes said the plate nerfs are like 7% dam reduction
[0:24:18] Abruty: shouldnt they just removed armor at all for pvp ? Would make balacing a bit easier
[0:24:20] zachgamegodx: that root change tho
[0:24:20] Taevenx: pre-nerf ret
[0:24:21] zachgamegodx: frost mages
[0:24:22] cubsthemonk: what do you think the best healers will be
[0:24:25] agren13: I don't like the fear and root buff tbh. Do warriors still get their fear buff talent in addition to the buff?
[0:24:27] Shakertime: anything that makes warlocks better is a bad change in my book
[0:24:29] Badasti: yeh now the hunters killshot will only overkill me by 30k instead of 45k
[0:24:34] jontepman: I recall you talk a lot about changing armor before this change was announced
[0:24:42] jontepman: as a way to balance
[0:24:49] pvalue01: random rsham armor nerf like wtf lol
[0:24:49] Dwilk20: What Venruki that 300k Sniper shot being reduced by 9000 wont make a difference lol?
[0:25:02] taylorperiod: whats good brotherman
[0:25:50] Duides: Sniper shot? People actually play that?
[0:25:51] whitra91: my only concern is the warrior dmg nerf
[0:26:07] whitra91: @duides on bgs maybe xd
[0:26:19] Duides: Yea, I could see in BGs
[0:26:31] Carmswolo: rsham is already hard to play atm and then they nerfed them
[0:26:33] Carmswolo: dont know why
[0:27:04] Carmswolo: rdruid is overrepresented and they buffed them... like wut?
[0:27:19] pvalue01: because theyre genuinely not good at managing the PvP aspect of the game. im not a doomer by any means, but they just dont care much about pvp
[0:27:22] Duides: They are actually a bit nerfed now Carms
[0:27:49] ZeraSeries: Which healer have you been having the most fun on Mr Ven?
[0:28:18] dawnovun: Good afternoon fellow non deoderant appliers.
[0:28:57] it_weez: Are you running mast or crit? Im trying to learn hpal as well and see a bit of both
[0:29:02] Asharnix: Do you think the armor change will be painful for holy pal?
[0:29:19] memil141: rating on yure palla
[0:30:10] memil141: dang!!
[0:30:12] j_rd95: you can judgment of the pure root beam
[0:30:16] memil141: stil!
[0:30:18] mmiittee: !songname
[0:30:27] kreyzy8: lmao I watched that one
[0:30:29] memil141: hahaha
[0:30:33] healhut: the pika 6-0?
[0:30:34] nerdyorc_: the one that Pika won every round?
[0:30:36] jayyArrington: lol i did too
[0:30:41] Dwilk20: Pika
[0:30:41] jayyArrington: pika lmaoo
[0:30:42] younotmytwin: What a stacked lobby lol
[0:30:43] matt_caste: meep
[0:30:44] Arubicon: cdew
[0:30:45] Shakertime: def pika
[0:30:49] DaveTheBrave1: watched that one from pika pov, insane :D
[0:30:57] lopenwow: pika masterclass
[0:31:14] FlashZappa: it was last night?
[0:31:17] Asharnix: that game was sick, pika wrecked it
[0:31:46] kreyzy8: ret hpal lobby Sadge
[0:31:47] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got MASSIVE 10.2.5 Class Tuning & PvP Changes" view it here: youtu.be/LFKMv81If4A
[0:31:48] og_loudermilk: wasnt awc today?
[0:31:55] whitra91: that amount of cc xd
[0:32:15] whitra91: too much micro cc in this game
[0:32:26] dawnovun: it wasn't pika - and I am not going to say who it was but I was watching a top streamer the other day and they accidentally exposed that they were using AHK. So wild.
[0:32:42] whitra91: ahk?
[0:32:51] dawnovun: Auto Hotkey. It's a scripting tool.
[0:32:57] whitra91: lol
[0:33:34] healhut: if they exposed it then when wouldnt you say who it was?
[0:33:36] jamescs1995: can u freeze trap twice as hunter now?
[0:33:49] taylorperiod: @beep101boop exactly lol
[0:34:04] pvalue01: just occured to me that i dont think ive seen a single feral, surv, fury, fdk this entire season in shuffle lol
[0:34:26] dawnovun: @beep101boop Because no one called them out on it lol and I actually like them. Just dissapointed that even super high end players are doing it Lol
[0:34:45] healhut: seems sus
[0:35:05] taylorperiod: weird that you wouldnt want to expose a cheater though
[0:35:16] slummin36: you can also judge strange
[0:35:21] slummin36: strang*
[0:35:33] healhut: yeah if they showed it on stream then thats on them. no reason to not say who it was
[0:35:37] taylorperiod: @dawnovun won't say even though he says he saw it on steram
[0:35:38] healhut: if it actually happened
[0:35:43] taylorperiod: *stream
[0:35:45] Carmswolo: an autohot key? not sure what that is, but i'd assume it benefits someone that casts dots
[0:35:58] anmusallam: hi venman
[0:36:08] anmusallam: how are you :)
[0:36:41] Xeruz: @Carmswolo u cant miss kicks with ahk
[0:36:56] taylorperiod: @Xeruz yes you can, you can still get faked
[0:37:14] taylorperiod: oh wait are you talking about Xeek?
[0:37:32] Xeruz: @taylorperiod yeah maybe , so many sht these days :D
[0:37:43] taylorperiod: yeah i think thats who
[0:37:50] taylorperiod: and meep is still playing with him
[0:38:27] Carmswolo: i remember back in WoD the moment i got past 2.2k it was almost nothing but boomy and affy lock scripters
[0:38:41] Gahunda: hey Ven, any garbanzo arenas tonight?
[0:38:49] Taevenx: absolute menace to that boomy
[0:38:50] ItsRahain: Who's excited for ALGS?
[0:39:28] bonchwater1: What are the best healers atm?
[0:39:34] taylorperiod: rdru
[0:39:37] taylorperiod: the end
[0:39:52] Romanowski: How has Dragon Legends been? The new expansion is in pre order right?
[0:40:14] Xeruz: @Romanowski yupp new xpac end of summer
[0:40:38] retrospeced: ouch bubble and turtle
[0:40:54] whitra91: @venruki do you think these changes slow the metadown? for example stam buff in pvp
[0:41:08] Gahunda: u got trinket back u fine
[0:41:15] jeviensduBresil: @venruki saw asmon reacting to your video talkin bout complexity to new players. i'm one of them, do you think that i sould be retail or classic
[0:41:19] Asharnix: cutebow will win with the power of friendship
[0:42:03] Gahunda: gg
[0:42:15] ItsRahain: Retail is alive. Classic is dead.
[0:42:16] enviscerate: surprising the ret didnt leave
[0:42:17] retrospeced: the split between expansions has killed the player base
[0:42:18] dipicat: hes not old enough for classic yet
[0:42:28] Gahunda: @itsrahain big lol
[0:42:28] kittarie: @venruki do you think it would be a good idea to have a followers pvp option for people to try pvp ? like the new dungeon option
[0:42:41] ItsRahain: Classic has no longevity. Everyone dips in gets their nostalgia hit and then bounces.
[0:42:42] Deevo_Twitch: classic is boring to me i def prefer retail
[0:42:43] ArmstrongInvictus: I've started playing about a month ago, like retail much more than classic
[0:42:44] pvalue01: i feel like if youre even asking the question retail is the answer. classic is for wow boomers like me who have the nostalgia
[0:42:47] zer0f0x: retail if you're a more competitive gamer imo. more "dedicated" to getting good at one game.
[0:42:53] silveiraaaaaa: never played WoW in my life this game seems hard as f
[0:42:58] kittarie: well for people like me that are bad and learning
[0:43:01] Shakertime: season of dads is pretty fun for a few hours
[0:43:10] ItsBees: Ven rukiLove itsbeeS
[0:43:11] retrospeced: blizzard now want you to constantly jump from one expac to another, its just a money grab now
[0:43:28] Secretwombatbro: the cool thing is theres no rush if youre new
[0:43:29] Deevo_Twitch: @silveiraaaaaa you can get into just study a specific class/race
[0:43:31] Ambersulfr: so close
[0:43:32] Gahunda: @itsrahain says who? u got access to blizzard servers or data? are u the ceo? or u just happen to be a god to know everything?
[0:43:34] zachgamegodx: 22000 WAS UR GOAL
[0:43:39] trentbail23: figuring out all your keybinds is the hardest part
[0:43:41] Romanowski: They need to do complete nuke a d reset to WoW 2. So much bloat
[0:43:55] AlphonzeVII: SoD is the most fun I've had in years of playing WoW. I still really like WoW arenas but if I tried to get back into it now everyone would have double my health
[0:44:02] Deevo_Twitch: @venruki have you ever gotten drunk on stream before/
[0:44:09] happyheals: It looks good, I wanna see how hard Chastises will hit for
[0:44:10] Vulvayer: ye, mby lightweaver will be dope wit hthe buffs to heal aswell
[0:44:22] retrospeced: sod felt good but when you realise its just to baby sit you until next xpac, turns you off
[0:44:34] Snypes_SYCO: @Deevo_Twitch I think only Pika does that.
[0:44:35] Arubicon: what should i do about my frail ego and the toxic players in solo Ven?
[0:44:59] Gahunda: mute chat, arubicon
[0:45:04] trentbail23: i like how they are putting new retail lore into it
[0:45:09] zagabombs: @venruki what is your huge brain top 3 specs on tues besides ret kek
[0:45:11] AlphonzeVII: even if that is their intention they're doing a good job, I dont think I will care for the new expansion more than classic
[0:45:15] Asharnix: Ven can you share the blessing of summer weak aura?
[0:45:22] serratedlove: assa challenge this season?
[0:45:34] venruki: https://wago.io/dvsMe0mGB
[0:45:35] Zorek64: hi
[0:45:41] happyheals: Send every player a friend request at the start of every rmatch
[0:45:46] Asharnix: Thnk you
[0:45:48] Deevo_Twitch: how often do you get stream sniped?
[0:45:53] happyheals: so bad
[0:46:09] Duides: Where is Jungyup now Ven?
[0:46:18] Badasti: das a huge sippy cup
[0:46:43] Deevo_Twitch: @venruki im nervous bro
[0:46:50] Badasti: !sippycup

[0:48:23] zen_oni_shinobi: had a paladin add on for my classic 60 non hc paladin to aid buffing my party.  add on was called blessme, and served as a substitute to pallypower.  pally power didn’t have an option for 5 minute blessings in party.  bought a new laptop and couldn’t find blessme in curse upon reinstalling my games.  -.-.
[0:49:50] Duides: Who's the team to beat in AWC?
[0:50:06] zen_oni_shinobi: sorry for the text wall there friends.

[0:54:59] taylorperiod: no
[0:55:14] nixxor: venruki i think your strongest class is arcane mage
[0:55:43] Itankarenas: jesus, WoG heals for like a dollar. they gutted that shit
[0:56:05] pvalue01: i wish they would've given feral a little more...spec hasnt been good since SL convoke cheese 1shot
[0:56:37] trentbail23: should of given the bottom 3 tanks some love too.
[0:56:37] belvedee: the ss experience xD
[0:56:55] likeewlock: he will be back when is in enemy team
[0:57:09] Reiumi_: PauseChamp
[0:57:36] Mhortai: Mhortai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Big healer games!
[0:57:46] YodaBest01: think you go more pressure without the DK in game
[0:58:21] anmusallam: it has a crazy burst
[0:58:21] Itankarenas: yeah, I focus feral every lobby
[0:58:23] buttercps: feral is good, it's meant to be a dot spec, not a one shot spec
[0:58:36] Metrobloom: @pvalue01 feral was good throughout the whole of SL
[0:58:37] thendj: feral is worst melee by far
[0:58:39] hawgcast: feral was pretty insane for a bit in DF S1
[0:58:40] thendj: just flops
[0:58:41] aaggros: wasnt feral op af season 1 df
[0:58:43] jacob_the_mage: !song
[0:58:43] Nightbot: Enable the AHA Music Identifier to find out the song! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-music-identifie/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en
[0:58:49] uneasy__: feral Aug fw was insane last szn
[0:58:53] chrye_xx: I main feral and hate the design
[0:58:56] chrye_xx: bottlenecked
[0:59:01] Aztecsx: it is such a weird design, spam cyclone for dmg is just questionable design
[0:59:14] jheas1: Ven serious question , once you reach the same CR and MMR how do you climb , can get in 4 games a day go 3-3 on 2 4-2 one and 2-4 on the other so win loss is the same yet -40 rating
[0:59:15] atomic_gossipgirlxo: MMR donation
[0:59:19] Itankarenas: Smoke his ass EZ
[0:59:20] dakotan517: rip his mmr
[0:59:23] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Open up your purse and take as much as you can
[0:59:25] brazkat: just hit 1800 on my paladin today!
[0:59:31] IamWalnuts: good lobby for you atleast
[0:59:31] dakotan517: nah
[0:59:35] Nonversations: Venpookie :D
[0:59:40] dakotan517: youre retribuki
[1:00:15] Itankarenas: that's how mmr/elo work. you end up with a 50% winrate over time
[1:00:35] jheas1: but you can win and lose the same amount of games and end in a negetive out come cause when you lose 1 extra you lose 35 rating but when you win one extra you only get 9
[1:01:27] Magottx: hola how was our hike today?
[1:02:08] xdtai: hey guys, trying to pick up warlock again, is demo still good or is destro king now?
[1:02:09] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:02:26] Kulefisk: Can subrogue use sword/axe in offhand or only double dagger?
[1:02:30] Magottx: @xdtai both but demo will be omega shenron in 3 days
[1:02:51] Taevenx: I would have sanc'd u
[1:02:55] gamerdadhooper: do you have any tips on how to handle sub rogues as a hjealer (specifically hpal)?
[1:02:58] xdtai: @Magottx how come?
[1:03:03] wackpoetic: I'ma be real, I would not have sanced you either
[1:03:07] dvoraklol: !spec
[1:03:10] pvalue01: @Kulefisk ye
[1:03:11] krome2dadome: @Kulefisk i believe only assa needs double dagger
[1:03:16] aaggros: everyone getting their rets ready for tuesday
[1:03:24] aaggros: but they dont know how to play
[1:03:27] Magottx: @xdtai general buffs inc that all benefit demo a lot
[1:03:50] Taevenx: @aaggros it's not too hard to play
[1:03:54] healhut: @aaggros they'll fit right in with the rest of them then lol
[1:05:10] taylorperiod: trick of the trade, such a banger
[1:05:17] taylorperiod: dude wrote this when he was 14
[1:05:18] taylorperiod: crazy
[1:05:56] SsatanSpeedsUp: whats is the stats for Hpala?
[1:06:23] Irascible: he is
[1:06:24] aaggros: he is
[1:06:32] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy imortalpally WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:06:36] happyheals: Glad stance
[1:06:55] Bourbons86: @SsatanSpeedsUp mixture of crit and mastery, which you prefer more of is kind of personal preference
[1:08:12] dakotan517: beautiful rep
[1:08:18] belvedee: nicely done
[1:08:18] Vulvayer: ey ven good rep, oh thanks ven
[1:09:27] dakotan517: oh my
[1:09:31] enviscerate: you would have died if ret buffs were live :^)
[1:09:43] jondoe2239: ret shits on hpal
[1:09:45] PreservingSanity: youre dead on that next wednesday
[1:09:48] Itankarenas: I really dont like how they've changed healing
[1:09:49] Taevenx: typical Ret/DH behavior
[1:09:51] PreservingSanity: or tuesday
[1:10:19] Itankarenas: instead of having spammable heals and stronger heals with short cds, you just have a bunch of little piss heals
[1:10:27] dvoraklol: any chance your could share your spec mate? cheers
[1:10:52] happyheals: healing is more fulfilling with higher actions per minute
[1:10:55] Itankarenas: It's stronger probably. I just don't like it
[1:10:57] meepoenjoyer: yeah healers are legit gods
[1:11:03] jondoe2239: yea no dampening in bgs
[1:11:03] wackpoetic: I just did a BG Blitz and was top damage and healing as Pres
[1:11:04] baxter5569: healing is great, dampening needs changes
[1:11:06] happyheals: Even in some rbgs it is like that
[1:11:07] Itankarenas: I preferred the old style more
[1:11:07] meepoenjoyer: they make bad players unpunishable sometimes
[1:11:15] pugulus_prime: Well in a BG more then one person should be attacking the healers
[1:11:18] Bourbons86: god when no damp at least
[1:11:19] Brotali1ty: yeah cause theres no dampening in bgs
[1:11:37] Dristereau: People don't have brains in random bgs mostly, they attack the closest
[1:11:39] pvalue01: everyone's CDs are just too strong. including healers
[1:11:46] R0NGG: ya and raid healing talents healers have big aoe
[1:11:47] Twotwistid: i like healers position atm, its not a hardcore 1 shot kill finally, dieing in a cheap shot is annoying
[1:11:48] Dristereau: could be a tank and they'd hit that
[1:12:24] happyheals: If healers were piece of cardboard for you to train on, do you think they would queue for the arfena to waste their time?
[1:12:38] happyheals: arena*
[1:12:41] Magottx: @Itankarenas i agree tho. healing wave, casting nourish, holy lights etc actually mattered and felt good for mana efficency etc
[1:12:51] Itankarenas: It's just weird, cuz I mained hpally for like 5 years, and seeing WoG do like 0 healing is so weird to me. It costs 3 holy power and looks completely useless
[1:13:02] Itankarenas: @Magottx yeah, 100%
[1:13:31] pvalue01: @Itankarenas yes, because everyone only does damage or healing via cooldowns. rotational abilities are all piss
[1:13:41] happyheals: that small heal was free though
[1:13:47] dakotan517: OOOOO
[1:13:48] Itankarenas: EZ Clap
[1:13:48] Bourbons86: well played
[1:13:49] greentko: TOLD YOU WE'RE GETTING 4
[1:13:52] Vulvayer: ez WPWP
[1:13:53] Brotali1ty: wow that was insane#
[1:13:54] gamerdadhooper: omg well played bro
[1:13:58] taylorperiod: grats ven
[1:14:07] dvoraklol: does holy get teir set?
[1:14:11] IamWalnuts: the rogue triple dr'ing blind lost them that round if he just waited 10 seconds the game was over
[1:14:19] davegoodwin1982: GGs ven -dh
[1:14:23] gamerdadhooper: hate when i queue vs rogues as healer tho
[1:14:40] Brotali1ty: by far
[1:14:41] hollow1zed: his duel probably bugged his dr tracker
[1:14:41] gamerdadhooper: truee
[1:14:42] Vulvayer: playing against them is just 0 fun
[1:14:43] veni_92: Is frost mage tir set good in pvp?
[1:14:43] Itankarenas: As a destro main, I don't mind sub rogue
[1:14:46] Brotali1ty: even Dh sometimes
[1:14:52] Magottx: faced double sub in my last shuff on afflic lol. 5-1 tho CoolCat
[1:14:57] Devcomz: Assa and Outlaw rogues probably hate fighting sub rogues. Sub Rogues probably hate fighting sub rogues
[1:14:59] pvalue01: 2 immunities. double vanish. duel. bomb. 1 shot potential....broken spec lmfao
[1:15:05] Reiumi_: EZ
[1:15:05] happyheals: Rogue mage was easier to play against in 2s than ww priest
[1:15:17] IamWalnuts: dh time?
[1:15:22] chrye_xx: controlling a whole lobby as a sub rogue is so satisfying
[1:15:31] Bourbons86: my top 4 specs to hate are sub rogue, arcane mage, demo lock, bm hunter (latter ones because of pets on screen)
[1:15:38] happyheals: at around 2.2-2.4k mmr
[1:15:45] Vulvayer: do u find deva fun?
[1:15:47] Magottx: maybe hot take, but dev and demo are my most hated to fight. just so aids
[1:15:50] gamerdadhooper: what is a more fun healer to play, rsham or hpal?
[1:16:10] Irascible: warrior players in shambles trying to hit an arcane mage
[1:16:15] Ambersulfr: dev, sub, and rdruid are the only ones that truly annoy me
[1:16:39] Bourbons86: @gamerdadhooper imo hpal, just because you don't have to worry about people running out of your totems, or people killing your totems
[1:16:41] apaine27: Supa is up there on shaman, priest and druid
[1:16:43] zachgamegodx: supas one of the best shamans ye
[1:16:44] apaine27: last I looked
[1:16:48] apaine27: he’s a gamer
[1:16:52] Itankarenas: I think he was messing with lava surge yesterday
[1:16:59] veni_92: its also gettin buffed next reset right?
[1:17:07] Brotali1ty: ok he's going full agressive build
[1:17:10] Magottx: why everyones alt sham swears its op but shaman mains swear its awful lol
[1:17:13] nikthevoker: LUL my rdruid saving heals for next game
[1:17:18] Brotali1ty: with stormkeeper and surge
[1:17:37] Ambersulfr: because shaman mains miss how good it's been in past seasons
[1:17:41] happyheals: yes I think
[1:17:49] Ambersulfr: it's not bad rn
[1:17:57] Ambersulfr: I like it
[1:17:58] happyheals: it is good
[1:18:01] happyheals: real good
[1:18:12] Ambersulfr: the tide health buff helped a lot
[1:18:24] Brotali1ty: @Magottx I know man I used to think as well and theory yeah you can say that but once you actually hop on to shuffles with rshaman you dont actually have that much time to do as much dmg as you would like too cause then you fall behind or lose
[1:18:28] realdreadx: does that toon really poop procs?
[1:18:33] Iridiumspx: ven pls no
[1:18:43] Iridiumspx: im testing lightweaver build for tuesday lol
[1:18:48] Brotali1ty: @Iridiumspx you got it bro
[1:18:58] nikthevoker: so many healers ive seen get free rating this morning 1800-2k handouts LUL
[1:19:02] five_moke: FINISH HIM!
[1:19:07] Itankarenas: leveling my ret rn EZ
[1:19:09] happyheals: S Tier in All Rated PVP combined on Subcreation.net
[1:19:38] Magottx: @Brotali1ty oh ok. ill take your word, i dont play sham so idk.
[1:19:59] Itankarenas: that boomkin just had like 1hp
[1:20:16] veni_92: first cast
[1:20:36] veni_92: instant heals prty strong ngl
[1:21:19] Axesmittayyy: how are cycling through your group to heal?
[1:21:40] Itankarenas: look at that row of ret cds KEKW
[1:22:00] mysticalmoun: sad to play boomkin these days
[1:22:04] IamWalnuts: ven going to klepto the sam priest twice
[1:22:08] IamWalnuts: same*
[1:22:13] skez_live: @venruki Have you tried the default arena frames lately with Diminish for DR & OmniAuras for buffs and Debuffs they are actually good i swear
[1:22:18] Lazeeqt: boomie OP
[1:22:20] mysticalmoun: boomy is punch bag
[1:22:38] happyheals: someone woke up today and chose confusion
[1:23:10] Brotali1ty: @Magottx there are cases where your teammates know how to play and you just riptide them and they just dont lose any hp so you free to do dmg for short time there but thats a bit rare
[1:23:25] pvalue01: rsham meatballs are gonna be juicy on tuesday
[1:23:34] Brotali1ty: @venruki how much haste are you running??.
[1:23:36] mysticalmoun: i told ya :D
[1:23:41] Ambersulfr: rsham is going to be wrecking people
[1:23:45] Ambersulfr: if they get to free cast
[1:24:18] Ambersulfr: they normally dont in shuffle
[1:24:34] Brotali1ty: with 20% on lava burst and bolt yeah probably, think I'll see every shaman running lava surge and stormkeeper
[1:24:57] pvalue01: battle shaman play style is the most fun
[1:25:04] Ambersulfr: i'm going to try it in 2s first
[1:25:15] Ambersulfr: if it doesnt kill it might be trolling
[1:25:26] Brotali1ty: @Ambersulfr in 2s I will say its easier especially if you're with a friend
[1:25:54] Brotali1ty: @Ambersulfr imagine this currently lava burst hits for 100k already
[1:26:09] Ambersulfr: i know i main it
[1:26:22] pvalue01: its not bad but you have 0 passive damage like disc / rdruid
[1:26:34] Brotali1ty: oh xD well you kinda know what to expect next week
[1:27:52] Ambersulfr: idk what to think about the random armor nerf though
[1:28:18] gamerdadhooper: that static was noice
[1:28:36] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: there is no shaman healing buff
[1:28:39] mysticalmoun: I'm surprised they lowered the druid's armor in moonkin.. it will be only punch bag.. nothin more
[1:28:45] skez_live: Sham utility is so nice
[1:28:59] Ambersulfr: OH, I hadn't calculated it all out. That makes sense
[1:29:07] IamWalnuts: but evoker kept theirs
[1:29:12] happyheals: they want them to use the toolkit they have withj talents that weren't being used enough
[1:29:17] rembrandt89: but warlock armor NotLikeThis
[1:29:22] zachgamegodx: Evoker armor is highest now and aug is now the armor battery
[1:29:44] Ambersulfr: well that's silly, they must've missed that one
[1:29:55] Brotali1ty: @Ambersulfr dont worry everyone's scratching their heads on why they did that, makes absolutely no sense...
[1:30:00] Swingingwilly: so whats point of having plate and mail now why not just all be leather
[1:30:00] happyheals: armor is 17,189 when I shift into bear form
[1:30:28] foxyllama: Procpooper Kreygasm
[1:30:56] Badasti: @happyheals what % dam reduction is that?
[1:30:59] yesterday_potato: so glad playing rsham i suck so bad
[1:31:13] dewwy_o: Do you think there's gonna be a big nerf to rdruids with the changes?
[1:31:23] happyheals: bear form with master shape shifter and you hit iron furand use enmraged regen
[1:31:28] ItsBees: The nerf isn't big enough for rdruid
[1:31:46] Fueldx: BM or Survival ?????
[1:31:47] ItsBees: they need a redesign, not a numbers fix
[1:31:52] foxyllama: Whisper him “boomy gap” he will play better
[1:31:54] Dwilk20: Rdruids and Sub rogues got tiny slap on the wrist
[1:32:07] skez_live: need a 30sec cd on clone
[1:32:10] Dwilk20: They would have to nerf Cheap shot and Treeants
[1:32:11] Moobot: Latest video "PvP Rewards Are Still Too Hard To Get In Dragonflight, Data Shows" view it here: youtu.be/NSw9Imk5bec
[1:32:16] LifeOfDanDotMe: I always hear that rsham is the worst healer (other than holy priest) is this still accurate this patch?

[1:36:41] jacob_the_mage: docs would say "you have covid? cant help ya. Go rest"

[2:01:22] jporter_: theres soooo many devs
[2:01:23] taylorperiod: dev is everyone rn
[2:01:24] Smexxin: dev evoker is really good atm
[2:01:24] dakila24: that's like calling dh an advanced spec lol
[2:01:37] Brotali1ty: I meant augvoker sorry!!
[2:01:49] chicken_yug: just geared up my devo its fun, wouldnt say its very difficult really. one of the easier rpds
[2:01:57] GraveWoW: the thing is every button on dh does damage
[2:01:58] pvalue01: what makes a spec hard is how punishing it is if you fuck up
[2:02:14] Dwilk20: You just described Ret and Warriors
[2:02:14] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:02:17] gelatokush: theres is a difference between a good dmg rotation and bad on dh weather it gets job done its another question
[2:02:21] ZinZou1: Hey, haven't played since shadowlands, do u think if I start, I will get into the game quickly?
[2:02:41] Brotali1ty: yeah wheres augmentation gone to?? lol havent seen anyone in ages
[2:02:42] obstata: played any elemental lately on pp?
[2:02:48] gelatokush: yo in pve the bad dh cant hide they are bottom of meters
[2:02:51] chicken_yug: yeah zin, conquest is uncapped now so you can gear up in like a few days
[2:02:54] rembrandt89: id rather have rets an dh's oneshotting me all day over warlock meta
[2:02:55] LowellTO: i still didnt get my battle mender title, i think its bugged
[2:03:01] ZinZou1: @venruki Hey, haven't played since shadowlands, do u think if I start, I will get into the game quickly?
[2:03:05] danieltsmoke: @venruki Think devokers life will be a bit easier with the stam/armor buffs?
[2:03:11] Dwilk20: its like 50 wins
[2:03:14] Dwilk20: 1800+
[2:03:18] joyrex_j9: it only counts the wins between 1800-1900
[2:03:19] dawsonator171: I can't wait to test the legendary in 2s and 3s. really don't wanna test in shuffle cuz it's a shitshow
[2:03:31] Magottx: @Smexxin bro what about dropping one point in reduced soul rot to put it at 45 with PS. and running haunt?
[2:03:33] Badasti: man, starting a new mage... doing shuffs in green gear as frost is so much better than arcane
[2:03:39] Ambersulfr: yeah I’m wondering how Ven got it because he’s obviously never been stuck 1800-1900 for 50 wins
[2:03:55] Magottx: @Smexxin i feel like the extra point to bring it down is so useless. maybe put it in 5% moree drain soul dam
[2:03:58] zachgamegodx: We're almost in the gold collection process ven
[2:03:59] zachgamegodx: for vaults
[2:04:26] rekt1370: im playing s priest in shuffle its hard out here
[2:04:36] Smexxin: if you can free cast maybe but
[2:04:37] Brotali1ty: ven bit of a random question, do you remember chain harvest on shaman from shadowlands?? dont you think it should've made it to DF?
[2:04:42] dawsonator171: Unforch I got mine on DK
[2:04:49] Smexxin: soul rot is mainly used in my experience for the drains and healing
[2:04:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 2h legendary axe could be 5% more damage for them in PvP
[2:04:55] Smexxin: less about stacking with phantom
[2:04:57] ZinZou1: @venruki Hey, haven't played since shadowlands, do u think if I start, I will get into the game quickly?
[2:05:08] NozakGaming: shifting power feels mandatory for fire mage
[2:05:10] BatteryRM: shifting power was big in pve
[2:05:11] thendj: shifting power is too big in pve to go away
[2:05:14] mrmsix6: faeline stomp too, that ability suuuucks
[2:05:22] rekt1370: if its good in pve it stays
[2:05:29] Irascible: dont forget about your soup
[2:05:30] Zero_fuqz: why surprised about shifting ?
[2:05:31] snakefizz: 0-6 for arcane
[2:05:36] Magottx: @Smexxin oh shit really? ive been practically soley using it as lil burst goes with ps swaps
[2:05:37] gelatokush: sl had a bunch of cool ability like boon from priest chain harvest several others
[2:05:53] Dwilk20: Hardest fights will be against the DK
[2:05:57] tedstaTV: really why
[2:05:58] Dwilk20: but with the DK he should never get touched
[2:06:00] rekt1370: boon for priest was one of the coolest wonder why they got rid of it
[2:06:04] tedstaTV: arent dks good v arcane
[2:06:06] gamerdadhooper: fuck yeah just hit 1800 on hpal solo
[2:06:07] gelatokush: was too cool
[2:06:11] rekt1370: no melee is good vs arcane
[2:06:18] Smexxin: yeah its good if you can free cast for sure, i just think the sequence is so long that trying to always line it up can get interrupted pretty easy @Magottx
[2:06:21] Dwilk20: @rekt1370 Outlaw
[2:06:30] rekt1370: @Dwilk20  nah blink stun
[2:06:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Not sure I like this abomination limb animation better than what it was
[2:06:46] Magottx: @Smexxin ok ok i do agree i get kicked during and it fks it all up often. only at 2.1 so im sure itll get even harder
[2:06:49] rekt1370: arcane mage is broken af and if you cant purge their shit they omega god tier broken
[2:06:54] Magottx: @Smexxin tysm youre helpin me a lot btw <3
[2:06:56] Dwilk20: @rekt1370 OUtlaw has double Step and grapple on top of their personal freedoms they can keep up
[2:07:10] rekt1370: @Dwilk20  half of mages kit beats that lol
[2:07:12] Zero_fuqz: @rekt1370 only twd was farming raiku on arcane and whaazz so idk about that LUL LUL
[2:07:59] Magottx: last question, your opinion on dropping rot and decary for essence drain? @Smexxin
[2:08:43] Smexxin: only if youre 100% dying to that comp, otherwise i dont think its worth it
[2:08:58] Magottx: kk. tysm
[2:09:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mage guy was working it
[2:09:31] jacob_the_mage: is that gladius or sarena

[2:09:57] poserdan: poserdan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! running rsham before the nerf tomorrow huh?
[2:10:09] rekt1370: rsham is good but vs dh dk it struggles
[2:10:21] pvalue01: at high MMR shaman struggles. easily killed and countered
[2:10:24] JustTaki: Imagine you are just a normie 2.1 warrior in a shuffle and Smexin literally whispers you talents ^.^
[2:10:28] prtwentyfour: Cant wait till tuesday where my lock wont get 4 shotted by a melee anymore
[2:10:29] Byte_PvP: shaman feels very good imo, not rdruid levels but def strong
[2:10:30] sourbutts: resto sham armor nerf
[2:10:36] TooOldForThis__: resto sham armor
[2:10:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ele shaman might have the highest armor in PvP, I can see why they nerfed it for resto shaman
[2:10:43] shamanticsx: Shamans struggle into double melee cleaves, that's all the meta is rn
[2:10:44] poserdan: wait I thought today was monday lol TWO DAYS THEN
[2:10:50] addyz0r: cdew said shaman is no2 healer in 3 s. he just doesnt like them
[2:10:52] prtwentyfour: think armor nurf was plate only
[2:10:54] Smexxin: is it good if rsham has more armor than plate or nah
[2:11:10] gelatokush: i have almost 14 000 armor atm on my rsham
[2:11:13] r1zzlaplus: will sub be dead after evis nerf?
[2:11:14] Keveldinho: ele shaman got a little less good after the crit damage decrease at the start of s2
[2:11:34] Lazarinth: god damn, i gave a co worker a ride on thrusday, he coughed the whole time. said he wasnt sick. well now i tested positive for covid
[2:11:39] clappuchino: @r1zzlaplus yea unplayable reroll
[2:11:49] R0NGG: rsham has a ton of armor.. sheild has so much mail has decent amount too
[2:11:54] kitsoupne: evis nerf and hp buff
[2:11:54] rekt1370: @Lazarinth  oof what a scumbag
[2:11:55] Dwilk20: We all only wish Sub was dead
[2:11:55] aaggros: sub will only overkill you by 100k instead of 110k
[2:12:00] poserdan: I feel like rogue will go from god tier to A tier where they really should be.... hoping anyway
[2:12:00] Zero_fuqz: 10% evis nerf = dead PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:12:07] rekt1370: rogue and mage can never be bad LUL
[2:12:13] zimnoe: its not just the evis nef
[2:12:19] zimnoe: its the armor and health buff as well
[2:12:27] rekt1370: even if sub is not as good outlaw will be insane
[2:12:29] zimnoe: sub wont be as threatening
[2:12:41] gelatokush: as threathening to who
[2:13:01] Dwilk20: Boomie/sub still the best comp in the game
[2:13:09] rekt1370: arcane/rogue
[2:13:09] gelatokush: dh, ww druids are gonna died just as much
[2:13:09] Zero_fuqz: the 10% wont be even felt
[2:13:13] Zero_fuqz: relax lol
[2:13:18] jacob_the_mage: ven could you share your gladius profile? :o
[2:13:38] zachgamegodx: nobody has ever done that before ven
[2:13:42] dooshken: I usually just do one stream
[2:13:50] Ambersulfr: the Ven secret tech
[2:13:51] ggwpmanxdlol: lontar does 4 Keepo
[2:14:01] atkos69: is conquest still capped?
[2:14:08] rekt1370: conquest uncapped on reset
[2:14:18] poserdan: Genuinely wonder why blizz hasnt made earthen totem more obvious than what it is right now
[2:14:32] Zero_fuqz: yea, barelly visible
[2:14:46] jacob_the_mage: ven could you share your gladius profile?
[2:14:47] dooshken: every race has their own totem visuals
[2:15:02] chicken_yug: does ven use gladius?
[2:15:07] poserdan: earthen totem is straight up camouflaged haha
[2:15:07] healhut: the visual for earthen doesn't even matter. people insta-run out of barrier all day
[2:15:08] Zero_fuqz: @dooshken hes talkin about the dust on the ground
[2:15:12] gelatokush: yes
[2:15:14] Ambersulfr: yes
[2:15:14] pvalue01: yep
[2:15:16] kitsoupne: @rekt1370 i'll never understand this.. no pure dps class that has 3 dps specs should ever be 'bad'
[2:15:16] Ambersulfr: definitely yes
[2:15:21] zedrin_124: nah. i used to enjoy it as well. used to.
[2:15:23] wreklol: large cope. worst game mode by far
[2:15:26] Dwilk20: Yes seek your nearest Mental health Provider please
[2:15:28] poserdan: Venruki masochist confirmed
[2:15:30] faoolin: not anymore
[2:15:37] dooshken: @wreklol dont play it then
[2:15:45] wreklol: @dooshken i dont
[2:15:57] R0NGG: @HurleyStream pretty sure thats sarena
[2:16:26] CrucifyMTG: but your watching
[2:16:27] jacob_the_mage: how come the hp bars are so fat
[2:16:27] thehulklol: looks like hard matchup 4 the mage :/
[2:16:30] jacob_the_mage: mine are so skinny
[2:16:40] Ambersulfr: jokes aside if you’re not healing all the time maybe it’s more fun
[2:16:48] Ambersulfr: if you only heal its painful
[2:16:51] wreklol: @CrucifyMTG i'm supporting ven, cause he's a good dude. hence why i have the fancy icon next to my name
[2:17:03] faoolin: @Ambersulfr true story
[2:17:11] gelatokush: i have a bunch of conquest tokens think ima gear a assa id like to play outlaw but the learning curve seems like a process
[2:18:15] enviscerate: @gelatokush assa's learning curve is surviving
[2:18:21] krome2dadome: updated tier list NODDERS
[2:18:22] jacob_the_mage: ven can you share your sarena
[2:18:25] taylorperiod: yo youre crushing on the hpal
[2:18:37] gelatokush: i played assa last season i have a base
[2:19:11] prtwentyfour: I sub to two wow players Venrukki and JazGG
[2:20:33] slickdaddyg69: @prtwentyfour if u wanna watch good players play u should sub to whaazz
[2:20:37] nixxor: not lostr
[2:20:40] Ultramagnus85: just waited over 40 minutes for a ss que to pop and ended up lplaying against the same dps as my last que
[2:20:53] Ultramagnus85: why is it 40 minutes if I'm just playing the same people anyway
[2:21:10] healhut: because immersion
[2:21:12] blueboywiz: if you’re going to play resto at least rap while doing it
[2:21:49] jacob_the_mage: ven
[2:21:50] chrye_xx: ams does nothing in damp Jesus
[2:21:55] jacob_the_mage: how did you get your sarena bars to look like that
[2:22:35] faoolin: you have multiples "skins" for your sarena bars in the settings
[2:23:08] jacob_the_mage: @faoolin thank you so much I found it
[2:23:28] Anubatras: @Venruki im pretty scared about the upcoming armor changes in regards to monks and hunters... feels like they nerf dks all around not only that dmg adjustment but now on top of that you eat way more dmg aswell and dont rly have that much deffensive against phys dmg... would love to hear your opinion on that
[2:23:37] healhut: that was a big hit at the end
[2:23:51] pvalue01: dk's are in big trouble
[2:23:54] Roxxybolts: does ven every have a bad hair day? I feel like he rolls out of bed always looking this good meanwhile I am fighting for my life out here daily.
[2:23:55] prtwentyfour: @slickdaddyg69 I love Jazgg hes a lock like me, ven is just fun to watch
[2:23:57] healhut: monks got nerfed pretty hard
[2:24:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: More stamina and bigger anti-magic shield
[2:24:11] Ambersulfr: ven is always flawless
[2:24:16] ImJordanHi: Why are people even so worried about nerfs and buffs...whatever class is hot has an influx in players (meaning its really nto hard to re-roll to FOTM)
[2:24:16] slickdaddyg69: @prtwentyfour jazzgg use clickbot
[2:24:17] Ambersulfr: idk how he does it
[2:24:24] pvalue01: also Prayge that tomorrow we find out they just forgot to PvP tag the ret changes
[2:24:28] Mrshmyt: hunters and ww already violated dk. Its going to be so much worse
[2:24:33] prtwentyfour: Im sick from work have a really nasty cold
[2:24:40] Ambersulfr: kk
[2:25:04] ImJordanHi: @prtwentyfour Prob covid
[2:25:28] Anubatras: @Mrshmyt yeah exactly.... playing against monks is pretty scary allready.... i feel like this could end up feeling like shadowland monk oneshots all over again
[2:26:46] healhut: ww monk burst also got nerfed
[2:26:54] Ambersulfr: I got a cold myself
[2:27:06] prtwentyfour: @ImJordanHi Not sure I hope not cant afford to miss work multi days
[2:27:48] prtwentyfour: My work sucks its PTO time so youre sick its vacation time also being used
[2:28:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bigger death strike heals is probably going to be helpful for DK
[2:28:50] pvalue01: god the shaman specs this xpac have all been so sick
[2:28:56] pvalue01: sets**
[2:29:18] healhut: not a fan of this one

[2:30:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rets got nice damage buffs, I have to think them
[2:30:46] pvalue01: fear change + armor is just so weirdly insane for locks i dont get it lol
[2:30:58] betasoldier: I think DH because they didn't get nerfed.
[2:30:59] prtwentyfour: RET will be unkillable I think
[2:31:00] Dwilk20: Shadowplay is definitely stronger

[2:31:17] blueboywiz: Venruki if you were testing the new bg coming out next expansion you would tell us right

[2:32:31] healhut: and hp buff
[2:32:40] healhut: and all of locks def kit scales with hp
[2:32:42] healhut: sooooooo
[2:32:49] prtwentyfour: well DH and hunters where ripping the class apart fast
[2:32:50] likeewlock: like 4% physical reduction and whole community goes crazy
[2:33:19] prtwentyfour: was nurfed a lot from when we used to be able to cast it
[2:33:21] pvalue01: @venruki what do you think are the best and worst specs in the game purely from a design perspective
[2:33:40] Ambersulfr: if arms drops off the ladder that’s a big dub for locks in general
[2:33:41] ItsBees: boomy
[2:33:44] sourbutts: bm/demo
[2:33:46] dooshken: MM hunter
[2:33:47] prtwentyfour: Affliction is struggling ramp up wise is super slow

[2:33:49] healhut: mm hunter
[2:33:51] SplitViewAskew: feral
[2:33:53] smantana1: augmentation
[2:34:00] dooshken: MM hunter been terrible since the change after Legion
[2:34:00] pragma90: mistweaver
[2:34:02] pvalue01: i was thinking Fdk and maybe feral
[2:34:04] xGriefxGodx: Mistweaver (because it's like the only healer that has to cast)
[2:34:05] healhut: ah damn yeah aug might be it lol
[2:34:07] nerfurface: dev
[2:34:11] BrewCral: MM hunter is horrible
[2:34:12] IamWalnuts: Bring back breath of sindragosa frost
[2:34:15] rogerscruton1: ele since it never casts
[2:34:24] pragma90: mistweaver having the most mobility and needing to stand still to heal doesnt make sense
[2:34:25] dooshken: MM hunter the most boring spec in the game
[2:34:32] prtwentyfour: I love affliction but we are so behind the ball with starting dmg
[2:34:34] Duides: MM is a blast
[2:34:46] Magottx: not the entire spec, but rapture on afflic is such a weird design to me
[2:34:52] TrillOGtv: i just picked back up retail arena not last month and havent seen one augmentaion yet
[2:34:52] prtwentyfour: ramp up times super slow
[2:34:57] Ambersulfr: if they buff aff they need to lower the dispel penalty
[2:35:12] ItsBees: they need to get rid of eclipse
[2:35:12] BrewCral: @TrillOGtv good LUL
[2:35:21] Magottx: give me X% dot dam increase and take away rapture
[2:35:21] jondoe2239: bring back decimating bolt and the legendary

[2:35:43] lokum17: I love how Venruki calls for a armor buff on mages, 2 weeks later blizzard breaks the game and fks us all :(
[2:35:46] dooshken: did he die?
[2:35:47] Nachofez: he stucks 2 forks and then he shits himself
[2:35:47] Badasti: sounds like natural selection to me
[2:35:48] Ambersulfr: not a lot but just to see how it’s doing
[2:35:52] pvalue01: natural selection Pog
[2:35:59] ghostware9000: that toaster guy was one intelligent dude huh
[2:36:02] Magottx: DH main most likely?

[2:36:11] sourbutts: You did ask for the armor buff for mage like 2 weeks before it happened i was here
[2:36:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Venruki broke the game again LUL
[2:36:15] Carcer69: he even followed to type that
[2:36:16] dooshken: followed today lul
[2:36:20] Roxxybolts: Ven I need to show you the power of dh destro my god
[2:36:21] zachgamegodx: vven called for armor normalization
[2:36:25] smantana1: for sure Blizzard does what Venruki wants ..
[2:36:26] zachgamegodx: so its fair
[2:36:44] j_rd95: russian aug on EU is 2.7 in shuffle - i miss this spec being good to pick up and play
[2:36:45] prtwentyfour: People are so over reacting to this armor change. Yet wont admit that you can rip a clothy apart super fast in Season 3
[2:36:49] j_rd95: i was an aug enjoyer
[2:36:52] SteppzUP: Its a good change
[2:36:56] Roxxybolts: it’s so disgusting
[2:37:01] Magottx: isnt it really hard to live tho for the lock?
[2:37:02] sourbutts: ret demo also potential broken?
[2:37:03] lokum17: @zachgamegodx yea its fair a shaman will have 2-3k armor more than a warrior
[2:37:06] zachgamegodx: lonar became #1 pres evoker with infy and john coffey playing that
[2:37:18] zachgamegodx: only w's just chill q sesh
[2:37:19] Magottx: lmao there it is
[2:37:22] Roxxybolts: you get iron bark the dh presses tab chaos nova into coil and sends all the druids back to the lobby
[2:37:24] jondoe2239: theyre getting buffed
[2:37:25] jondoe2239: tuesday
[2:37:25] prtwentyfour: @Magottx Aff lock gets beat on bad
[2:37:32] kitsoupne: no way an assa rogue Wowee
[2:37:33] yesterday_potato: seen a bunch today too
[2:37:33] crazzbez: @prtwentyfour +1 hunters are a little too stupid and its completely undeniable
[2:37:36] IamWalnuts: that healer mmr diff time to klepto some big mmr
[2:37:39] yesterday_potato: at the pleb level
[2:37:43] ruxp1n: holy surprise face
[2:37:45] mipzee: wouldnt they rather wait and play after the buffs ? xD
[2:38:01] Kitpou: @mipzee they wanna get used to it before abusing it again
[2:38:03] jondoe2239: maybe theyre farming conq
[2:38:08] prtwentyfour: @crazzbez Hunters are insane dmg wise
[2:38:26] prtwentyfour: well said Venruki
[2:38:26] ladidaada: Feels so strange that they introduce such significant changes so late in the expansion though
[2:38:34] lokum17: How is it amazing that mail users will have more armor than plate????
[2:38:39] SteppzUP: Same with roots/fear with the amount of closers that classes have now it is a great fix.
[2:38:44] ruxp1n: armor changes feel like they're all being dragged towards mail armor for sure
[2:38:56] dooshken: @ladidaada I'm glad they're putting stuff out when it's ready rather than waiting full expansion
[2:39:00] Duides: like 5 hunts top 100 solo and 3v3 LUL Yet, worried about Hunter
[2:39:01] lokum17: @havenblood they will
[2:39:10] prtwentyfour: @ladidaada I have struggled all season its been a nightmare couldnt wait any longer
[2:39:14] Ronsimus: we will see how it play out, but the fact is that the game is getting more homogenized by these changes
[2:39:15] lokum17: @havenblood ele shamans will be highest armor in the game
[2:39:19] dooshken: The old mindset of them holding out content for months so it can be part of the new expansion is so lame
[2:39:33] crazzbez: he died with trinket
[2:39:40] Reign_TV: something about shaman armor getting nerfed right =[ ?
[2:39:52] prtwentyfour: <3
[2:39:52] volkr16: Hey Ven rnadom quesiton what size is your chair?
[2:39:54] Carcer69: @Reign_TV only resto
[2:40:07] ladidaada: Yeah maybe it will be a good change, but needs tuning all over again
[2:40:17] crazzbez: true on the mm damage
[2:40:18] Duides: Well, destroy s A Ret but dk, war, yea its a pain
[2:40:24] Ambersulfr: I agree that dynamic has been super toxic
[2:40:28] prtwentyfour: I think season 3 tuning broke the game this just levels it out
[2:40:29] justjoshingyo: warriors getting hit hard too. armed to the teeth talent makes them do more dmg for 10% of their armor. so they lose all that extra strength
[2:40:33] blueboywiz: they didn’t buff mm right? RIGHT?
[2:40:40] Ambersulfr: in the earlier versions of the game they addressed it with mobility but now everyone is zipping around all the time
[2:40:56] EinerjarWoW: Dk???
[2:40:59] rogerscruton1: shuffle
[2:41:00] SteppzUP: buff by nerf @blueboywiz but it isnt as big of a deal as people make its a good change to all
[2:41:00] Duides: Blue - it's a passive buff for MM. Will be less opressive into Mages and be able to kill melee now
[2:41:01] faoolin: you see why healing is annoying in shuffle ?
[2:41:02] snakefizz: LOL
[2:41:03] metaphorsx_: dk dies like a roach twice in a row
[2:41:03] EinerjarWoW: Unfortunate...
[2:41:04] ghostware9000: gotta love healing shuffle
[2:41:05] kitsoupne: ibf + trinket in first 15 sec of the game :)
[2:41:07] dooshken: healer diff Kappa
[2:41:07] jondoe2239: TIME FOR A MAJOR ABILITY PRUNING IMO
[2:41:07] faoolin: that's why
[2:41:07] nskurn: "HEAL?!?!"
[2:41:07] Magottx: sometimes theyre so bad you cant even be mad
[2:41:12] Ronsimus: i agree to certain degree, but  it could be changed in different ways. Even things out if kinda lacy design
[2:41:16] crazzbez: how do healers make it to 2.6k jesus
[2:41:17] itsKLAUUS: dk turned brain off and went brrrrr
[2:41:22] faoolin: It's fun, but soooo many people grief you
[2:41:28] Lamatastisch: i kinda hope they look at evoker armor. my pve geared evoker has 13.2k armor rn
[2:41:29] Ambersulfr: @crazzbez they q a lot
[2:41:37] Ambersulfr: or they're AWC contenders who literally play perfect
[2:41:41] ItsBees: @Magottx just played with a MM hunter whose highest damage was chimera shot, and didn't cast aimed shot once
[2:41:45] ZEROkiirby: that's the guy typing out "1 heal???"
[2:41:46] ItsBees: so I feel that
[2:41:50] jondoe2239: EVERYONE GETTING ACCESS TO TALENTS THAT USED TO BE SPEC SPECIFIC = EVERYONE HAS A STOP FOR EVERYTING = VERY NOT FUN
[2:41:51] faoolin: and with the mmr design, you just pay the price twice
[2:41:56] Duides: chimera? What is this, Cata?
[2:42:03] ItsBees: right? I was so confused
[2:42:19] Magottx: @ItsBees i swear i didnt even know that was in the game anymoree lol
[2:42:31] ItsBees: I had to log into my hunter to find where it is LUL
[2:42:32] EinerjarWoW: Bless you
[2:42:41] ItsBees: replaces arcane shot I guess
[2:43:05] dooshken: chimaera shot replaces arcane shot and makes it cleave
[2:43:21] Duides: MM will still be tunelled in to the dirt LUL
[2:43:47] ItsBees: corking the bat Pog
[2:43:53] lokum17: @havenblood That is just not right lol, my warrior has 14k armor in pvp rn my ele has 12,5k -30% on warr (4k ish) will put em 3k under eles lol
[2:44:03] IamWalnuts: if ven can take this round he takes the lobby
[2:44:08] IamWalnuts: 10%
[2:44:10] IamWalnuts: 100%
[2:44:14] alexvnderftw: lock did crazy damage
[2:44:18] Duides: Sosa amd Big Mac was hella entertaining though LUL
[2:45:00] IamWalnuts: LUL
[2:45:00] jondoe2239: @lokum17 thats because of your shield though
[2:45:02] faoolin: fact is, if a dps do a mistake and die, it's happens. But with the mmr design for healers the game will just tell "the other healer is better than you" which is not the case
[2:45:13] IamWalnuts: didnt you round 1
[2:45:13] tablez: rogue is 4-0 gotta shut him down
[2:47:09] Duides: EZ
[2:47:14] slyphex: that was crazy
[2:47:17] maverick350: u jinx it mate lol @tablez
[2:47:25] IamWalnuts: i hate top ports too but his port would be okay if he wasnt also playing right in los of it
[2:47:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: GO SAMMY
[2:48:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sammy was doing alright, ouch
[2:48:26] rogerscruton1: insane how bad u can be as dps and get 2.2
[2:48:30] Carlleque: What went wrong in this last one?
[2:48:33] EinerjarWoW: I missed it, what was dks score
[2:48:41] IamWalnuts: lock walled at 10% :)
[2:49:03] EinerjarWoW: Oh shit rip
[2:49:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: #ShammyLife
[2:49:57] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Polomec5 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:49:57] ladidaada: Trinket?
[2:50:05] wackpoetic: bro... heals???
[2:50:11] rogerscruton1: shammy ? heal ?
[2:50:13] ImJordanHi: Your lymph nodes better?
[2:50:14] slyphex: remember when you could tremor while feared
[2:50:14] AhrimanicRitualist: the fear
[2:50:16] ladidaada: Fear
[2:50:16] magnesiium1: trinket when the rogue still has blind lol
[2:50:21] faoolin: trinket sap then tremor ?
[2:50:21] BrewCral: No shot I could heal that would tilt the FUCK out of me
[2:50:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: People run out of earthen all day long, seems like
[2:50:54] Damitongo: warlock need to port
[2:50:54] Duides: You gonna be casting AWC?
[2:50:55] AhrimanicRitualist: nope, but was better than doing nothing
[2:51:04] Itankarenas: well, it's shuffle, so
[2:51:06] coledplay: just forsaken racial the fear
[2:51:12] magnesiium1: the warlock also has buttons too..
[2:51:13] tablez: I think only thing you couldve trinketed was the fear
[2:51:18] dawsonator171: trinket. lasso priest to get distance. Frost shock to kite. Kappa
[2:51:21] Notreallygood: You can't expect players to not press buttons IMO, I agree with Venrukit.
[2:51:24] AhrimanicRitualist: of course, you didn't play wrong, just saying it was the only thing you coulda done
[2:51:26] Notreallygood: Venruki*
[2:51:27] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Relying on your team to be competent is as good a bet as relying your enemy to be terrible
[2:51:32] Zarkos: i wonder if they gave dps extra rating for standing in earthern if they would do it
[2:51:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah generally if you trinket sap then you get burned in a kidney, right?
[2:51:57] coledplay: yeah but theres not a play there lock has to save himself
[2:52:08] ghostware9000: trinketing a sap that starts a cc chain is 99% of the time bad
[2:52:12] dawsonator171: using my CDs does not increase my dam.
[2:52:14] Notreallygood: If you do that, then you become as crappy as those players as you build bad habits.
[2:52:17] faoolin: yeah of course, dps press first, but has a healer in shuffle you have to press for them
[2:52:39] rogerscruton1: was the lock even in los when he died
[2:52:41] ladidaada: It was dps fault 100% for sure though
[2:52:57] Duides: You going to cast AWC Ven? If you answered already, sorry. Ad :D
[2:53:10] ItsBees: that means yes
[2:53:15] Duides: Noted! Thanks
[2:53:16] Reign_TV: isnt it next weekend lol?
[2:53:21] ItsBees: gonna be sweet Pog
[2:53:22] Notreallygood: these commercials ahhh
[2:53:27] ItsBees: !prime
[2:53:27] Moobot: @ItsBees rukiP Hey do you guys know about Twitch Prime? If you or someone you know has Amazon Prime, you can link it to your twitch account and sub to your favorite streamer (Venruki) for free!!! rukiP More info here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[2:53:30] Blitzylive: means he can't tell us guys but yes
[2:53:44] viewsfromct: Such an odd thing to be told to keep under wraps
[2:53:48] Swingingwilly: i take it your AWC casting aging this season
[2:53:55] Swingingwilly: again
[2:54:01] wackpoetic: It means he's not allowed to say yes, but he's not saying no.
[2:54:02] snakefizz: warrior is throwing
[2:54:05] Duides: Is Talb still around WoW?
[2:54:43] Damitongo: nerf evo again pls
[2:55:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: unfortch
[2:55:35] wackpoetic: Evo should get: a general damage buff, a slight mastery nerf, and a talent that raises the hp% floor for mastery
[2:56:01] snakefizz: warrior was afk for 30 seconds that match
[2:56:23] Duides: drag damage LUL
[2:56:30] AhrimanicRitualist: Would love to try evoker but I just can't bring myself to play as that dragon model, wish they'd add something so you could play in the human form
[2:56:33] Notreallygood: man, you show why healing isn't fun. You can't impact the game. You are the o-line of arena. Lots of responsibilities none of the impact plays.
[2:58:12] theodeth: next week that fear won't break!
[2:58:27] slyphex: @Notreallygood keeping people alive is pretty impactful :P
[2:58:48] ghostware9000: i have been playing too much SOD... what seems to be meta healer right now in retail?
[2:58:51] Magottx: agree. lowkey op op kinda slept on
[2:58:58] joyrex_j9: I had a game earlier as paladin where double dev instagibbed me through devo auro mastery + wall
[2:58:59] yesterday_potato: agree its just so overwhelming
[2:59:03] nikthevoker: LUL 2 45min waits in a row for someone to leave insta
[2:59:05] figurines: @Notreallygood Right. The center is always so underrated. Hardest position in the game
[2:59:05] Paybacks: so weird that their entire dmg profile is disintegrate too
[2:59:06] jimmythegent_tv: @ghostware9000 rdruid
[2:59:07] Adessius: I have a hard time with warriors
[2:59:08] Swingingwilly: i agree burst from nowhere
[2:59:12] Drathimos: pi doing work for that dragon
[2:59:12] maijoz: How long does the season still go for?
[2:59:37] Nemenon: @ghostware9000 rdruid is a few leagues above the rest atm
[2:59:45] ItsBees: @maijoz sometime in the spring
[2:59:45] kitsoupne: @maijoz 2-3 months prob
[2:59:57] nikthevoker: rally fell too
[3:00:05] faoolin: why not put shields before gates opening ?
[3:00:05] magnesiium1: 160k dps dragon
[3:00:07] magnesiium1: not bad
[3:00:08] snakefizz: dragons need buff
[3:00:24] crazzbez: is there going to be a new pvp season or we move on to war within?
[3:00:31] Nemenon: 1 more season
[3:00:49] Nemenon: 4 total
[3:00:55] crazzbez: hopefully there will be more
[3:00:58] zachgamegodx: @snakefizz all the dragon specs pump
[3:01:03] jacob_the_mage: season 4 hits after spring
[3:01:07] ZANEPVP: @venruki  steady procpoopin of CD!!!
[3:01:08] crazzbez: i'm apprehensive what blizz will do for pvp next xpac
[3:01:38] zachgamegodx: even aug does good
[3:02:41] snakefizz: ret has leggo
[3:02:41] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[3:02:52] magnesiium1: he mad LUL
[3:02:56] dawsonator171: that's not the leggo model
[3:03:06] healhut: didnt have enough *Pride* to stick it out i guess Kappa
[3:03:07] dooshken: do you think the rating loss should be higher for leaving?
[3:03:15] warap69: Some frost mage povvv
[3:03:26] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @dooshken I think they need an MMR loss for leaving as well. -150 cr and -150 mmr
[3:03:28] Damitongo: play rogue pls
[3:03:29] Fixit_cat: How's Sengmin doing
[3:03:30] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Just obliterate them
[3:03:32] Itankarenas: why do you have 3 mages btw?
[3:03:35] Smexxin: whats been your favorite stuff to play this season so far
[3:03:45] Zarkos: they should have a gulag for people that leave and they have to fight their way out
[3:03:57] greaser6996: where do those weapons come from on the DH
[3:04:00] zagabombs: what do you think will crank on tues @venruki thx <3
[3:04:01] dawsonator171: Gnomobility is his favorite. Kappa
[3:04:03] crazzbez: you think classes are in a good spot overall?
[3:04:09] dooshken: ww boring?
[3:04:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Holy paladin seemed like a good one
[3:04:13] j_rd95: why dont you like WW?
[3:04:20] chrye_xx: hate ww play style
[3:04:24] magnesiium1: i wish TOD worked
[3:04:37] magnesiium1: lights up 8 years after they hit the hp threshhold
[3:04:38] himpnote: it's not rewarding?
[3:04:50] Itankarenas: love this song
[3:04:51] numero5218: hey ven do you think the armor changes will positively or negatively affect leather classes
[3:05:03] peacant: you dont feel similar on arcane mage?
[3:05:06] sked420: being ccd an entire serenity is heart breaking
[3:05:12] zachgamegodx: no affect
[3:05:23] arcane_p: winswalker monk plays like sub rogue without two dance chargers
[3:05:34] magnesiium1: outlaw stronger into cleaves but weaker into casters
[3:05:42] magnesiium1: after the change imo
[3:05:44] Natan_Ntn: i think Dampen Harm is such a weird defensive cd
[3:05:54] numero5218: seems strange right now
[3:05:57] zachgamegodx: i think it makes them stronger, but stamina changes will lead to slower games
[3:06:00] dooshken: rogues insane against other melee to begin with so ehh
[3:06:00] hydroponics666: @venruki bro, how did they not touch DH. That class is actually cracked
[3:06:09] Fixit_cat: lol
[3:06:11] Natan_Ntn: and when you see a sub rogue playing on ww you just play scared all game
[3:06:17] zachgamegodx: it’s sub lite in terms of stuns
[3:06:30] zachgamegodx: yeah
[3:06:30] Itankarenas: fists of fury go brrrrrr
[3:06:36] crazzbez: yeah fine but basically nobody can play rogue like pikaboo
[3:06:37] arcane_p: I just meant that you kill with the cooldowns and then do nothing
[3:06:39] the_audacity_x: those swords look dope
[3:06:39] nystrall: As sub isn't most the damage from evis?
[3:06:40] diperna99: should you play 1h or 2h frost DK?
[3:06:42] Nachofez: rogues are the worst, playing against them is the worst. I feel like theres no counter play
[3:06:46] prtwentyfour: Stuns have gotten out of control
[3:06:49] zeranni1: ww is just a less tanky, less dmg, less cc version of DH
[3:06:52] zachgamegodx: i mean outlaw is the best rogue spec probably and will be
[3:06:59] Itankarenas: just play destro lock guys. rogues aint shit
[3:06:59] The__Swordmaster: Venruki finally playing DH? a noble SACRIFICE
[3:07:00] snakefizz: PUT A COOLDOWN ON CHEAPSHOT
[3:07:02] numero5218: they aren’t sub light I think it’s actually more reliable and defensive version of sub
[3:07:10] prtwentyfour: A ret can stun lock my Aff lock for 1M dmg
[3:07:19] Nachofez: increase the cooldown on cheap and kidney
[3:07:21] crazzbez: the whole liquid
[3:07:32] Itankarenas: @prtwentyfour that's not what a stun lock is
[3:07:43] chirsen: hey venruki, just got the season mount for wins over 1k. it is the pure grind for a casual player. how can blizzard make it so damn hard...... i mean not hard but it took for ever lol
[3:07:43] nystrall: If evis is all subs damage then there is almost no penalty for spamming cheap
[3:07:43] dooshken: pika is just way better than all of them Kappa
[3:07:55] Smexxin: gigachad
[3:07:58] magnesiium1: hp?
[3:07:58] addyz0r: HAHAH
[3:08:00] Magottx: jsut cause he wantedt eh totems on back lol
[3:08:01] zachgamegodx: high mountain link is crazy value
[3:08:03] Nachofez: gigachad indeed, secret tech
[3:08:07] joyrex_j9: the totems are so sick
[3:08:08] Itankarenas: bull rush
[3:08:08] Nachofez: bull rush

[3:08:17] ur_boy_jd: anyone know?
[3:08:18] Chadww: they catch more fish
[3:08:20] Badasti: its a stun
[3:08:21] Badasti: its good
[3:08:21] happyheals: 1 percent vers
[3:08:22] Nachofez: increased vers
[3:08:23] addyz0r: you should see the clip when he does it and realises it does nothing xD
[3:08:23] Itankarenas: and look like not an orc
[3:08:25] Badasti: extra mobility
[3:08:25] Magottx: he did it simply for the tmog lol
[3:08:26] numero5218: overall will it be a caster meta with the exception of rogue ?
[3:08:27] crazzbez: it's not 1% vers
[3:08:27] magnesiium1: i think its passive gives more hp no?
[3:08:28] ItsBees: also faster mining Pog
[3:08:29] joyrex_j9: it doesn't DR with stun
[3:08:31] JokeHoleToilet: increased vers
[3:08:33] tydrera: why do you have 3 different blur binds?
[3:08:37] whatam1do1ng: guys whats the new meta?
[3:08:37] boocraft1992: any recommendation on how to find a 3rd player for 3s? Me and my friend are old glad players and we're at 2300 almost in 2s with over 60% win rate but we don't know how to find a 3rd for 3s
[3:08:48] Nemenon: what in gods holy name
[3:08:50] kusoneko: what is wow
[3:08:50] Smexxin: some of the solo shuffle ladders are so funny
[3:09:00] zachgamegodx: @whatam1do1ng if I had to guess, fury warriors
[3:09:19] Eckosaurus: Xeek too good
[3:09:27] JustTaki: *facepalm* good thing we nerfing unholy o.O
[3:09:30] healhut: yeah and he has like 19 of them lol
[3:09:35] dooshken: pet kick is 3 of the two 7 dks lol
[3:09:37] zachgamegodx: the highest rated Evoker  in shuffle and 3’s in eu is a aug
[3:09:38] dvoraklol: why is there so many fromcanada?
[3:09:39] AhrimanicRitualist: wonder where that mage is from
[3:09:40] zachgamegodx: different augs
[3:09:41] dooshken: of the top 7*
[3:09:42] Kitpou: @JustTaki bruh look at the rest of the ladder
[3:09:45] lasergazer3: You played demo lock right? Am I missing something or is the 4-piece tier bonus severely underperforming? Throughout an entire shuffle it only did 250k..
[3:09:49] dvoraklol: haha
[3:09:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frost 4 ever
[3:10:00] JustTaki: @Kitpou yeah, where is the DH nerf?
[3:10:02] rogerscruton1: i respect it
[3:10:05] Nemenon: I wish I enjoyed a spec as much as fromcanada and bigdam do
[3:10:09] sbrees: Just like Bigdam
[3:10:18] NomFries: 8 separate accounts
[3:10:19] Kitpou: @JustTaki u're not wrong lol
[3:10:20] magnesiium1: big dam is on the extreme end of that lol
[3:10:20] wackpoetic: consistent with the name except for the one with the thirst tag
[3:10:20] Itankarenas: tbf, frost is fun af
[3:10:21] JmanOwnz: that has got to be something on the dsmIV
[3:10:21] Magottx: i  respect the grind
[3:10:33] ImJordanHi: appears the new meta is jus tmkae 15 of the class you like
[3:10:41] the_audacity_x: are those swords unobtainable now?
[3:10:44] Itankarenas: @JmanOwnz KEKW
[3:10:47] healhut: @JmanOwnz SeemsGood
[3:10:52] dooshken: @JmanOwnz I was just htinking that lol

[3:11:14] ItsBees: rukiS
[3:11:27] JokeHoleToilet: good god
[3:11:30] crazzbez: 500 rated shuffle
[3:11:44] Itankarenas: yeah, they must be rated like 200 mmr
[3:11:50] Itankarenas: they dont even know how to do dmg
[3:11:53] dvoraklol: haha
[3:11:53] Fixit_cat: How long does it take to get to 97%?
[3:12:06] Enme4: LMAO
[3:12:29] ImJordanHi: Isnt that semi similar to saying "as an ele shaman I hate seeing mages spam polly, wish I had that"
[3:12:35] nikthevoker: has to be like 7-8min right?
[3:12:37] Badasti: started playing my rogue in full greens yesterday, low mmr but I literally locked someone out from the opener for 20 seconds XD
[3:12:38] dvoraklol: outlaw looks sick
[3:12:59] Itankarenas: awful commentary, but good clips LUL
[3:13:01] dooshken: it helps that the class is insane
[3:13:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: W
[3:13:08] dvoraklol: pfffff
[3:13:08] waffleberryx: rogues btw
[3:13:11] Hobblefoot: @dvoraklol Outlaw is sick when you master it. It is annoying when you don't have the gist of it.
[3:13:12] Damitongo: LOL
[3:13:21] arcane_p: I hate outlaw it’s such a zoomer spec, you need to be drinking a redbull before you play it
[3:13:23] dvoraklol: fromcanada!
[3:13:30] healhut: speaking of from fromcanda lol
[3:13:36] nikthevoker: almost 1 tapped
[3:13:40] jondoe2239: just procd an ad can you link the video in chat plz @venruki
[3:13:41] arcane_p: you need to press to many buttons on outlaw at all times
[3:13:43] Fixit_cat: samiFinger  Clone City
[3:13:48] nikthevoker: then just 1 taps LUL
[3:13:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is why they are doing an evis nerf
[3:14:38] addyz0r: SKILL xD
[3:14:41] ItsBees: that's literal video evidence on why that class needs to be removed
[3:14:43] boocraft1992: world of roguecraft
[3:14:44] pvalue01: whaaz always complains about rogues in shuffle too lmao
[3:14:51] nikthevoker: @ItsBees ^\
[3:15:25] dvoraklol: hahaha
[3:15:29] dooshken: cool class
[3:15:33] Damitongo: OMEGALOL
[3:15:35] Enme4: LMAO
[3:15:36] pvalue01: i watched that live it was fucking hilarious
[3:15:38] nikthevoker: LMFAO
[3:15:49] nikthevoker: drunk pika toxic
[3:15:53] ImJordanHi: He's just loose off the goose, having a blast
[3:15:56] kyleuselton: i was there for that one lol
[3:15:59] prtwentyfour: I like how he acts like hes so good with a insanly OP class consistanly
[3:16:06] arcane_p: that was a good clip I watched that he 2vs1 like 3 games in a row
[3:16:08] boocraft1992: the best is when pikaboo does the in-game selfie camera toy before killing someone
[3:16:08] Damitongo: buff rogue :)
[3:16:09] ButtaTWD: rogues definitely not bad
[3:16:10] prtwentyfour: sorry but true
[3:16:12] crazzbez: @prtwentyfour COPIUM
[3:16:13] dooshken: @prtwentyfour He is good tho
[3:16:21] Nimrod_cx: where are the Joe clips
[3:16:28] prtwentyfour: stuns are just out of ccontrol though
[3:16:31] kyleuselton: wasnt he highest ranked ele in the world last season
[3:16:35] ImJordanHi: But forreal comparing rogue stuns to WW, isnt that like saying "as an ele its unfair mages get to spam polly when mine is 30 seconds"
[3:16:36] pvalue01: wasnt pika R1 on like 6 specs last season lol
[3:16:38] clicket: He acts good by being extremely good, method actor
[3:16:39] VetisBR: watched pika win like 4 games in a row the other night where his teammate went in and insta died while he just sat in stealth
[3:16:41] the_audacity_x: @prtwentyfour he's good on multiple classes so its pretty valid
[3:16:46] zachgamegodx: joe clips give ven anxiety
[3:16:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't seen Pikaboo do bad on a spec, even though he says he hates tanks he does well with them too
[3:16:56] crazzbez: @ImJordanHi well said
[3:17:07] prtwentyfour: yes but rogues brokken always has been, some skill but not that class
[3:17:10] varok87: I want to make a EU account only to face Joe Fernandes in Solo Shuffle xD
[3:17:17] xkrytekx: Wrong Enhance Shaman does
[3:17:27] Pwnyo808: @prtwentyfour he's literally been the highest rated in SS on multiple classes tho
[3:17:32] healhut: @prtwentyfour I guess we'll all get to watch you show him who the real good player is this awc right? Oh wait Kappa
[3:17:35] dooshken: enhance is mail
[3:17:38] xkrytekx: ya but you dont play cap
[3:17:39] pvalue01: lasso and cap are way worse though lol
[3:17:42] kyleuselton: i think the fact that there is so much a rogue can do to be really good with them and understand your tool kit is amazing
[3:17:43] majstorovicjebac: i mean, monk has other stuff
[3:17:47] taelin619: they dont use cap stun or relly laso
[3:17:54] xGriefxGodx: @xkrytekx wrong bud just take the L
[3:17:55] xkrytekx: I just heard agiailty i'm sorry ven
[3:17:57] xkrytekx: I love you
[3:18:04] xkrytekx: I didnt hear leather
[3:18:20] lordswigglez: i didnt hear it either
[3:18:36] illEvan11_11: he didnt say leather the first time, youre good homie lol
[3:18:43] slyphex: i heard it tho
[3:19:05] chubmax: @venruki is demo the next big thing Tuesday?
[3:19:07] xGriefxGodx: Contextually it was understood he was talking about ww compared to rogue, feral, and dh.
[3:19:32] crazzbez: think you're the only one who understood the context
[3:19:46] majstorovicjebac: imagine giving monk more stuns, bitch plz
[3:19:59] slyphex: remember when FoF procced stuns
[3:20:04] arcane_p: ww burst is insane though probably the highest in the game to be fair venruki even though I agree ww does have the least control of the leather classes
[3:20:07] Pwnyo808: how did DH not get any changes in the last tuning
[3:20:13] ImJordanHi: @majstorovicjebac I think they should have a 30 second stun, 1 min stun is out dated. And it should be longer... Kidney is a 20 sec CD, and 6 seconds long
[3:20:26] What_ln_Tarnation: isnt it getting nerfed tues
[3:20:40] wackpoetic: WW burst takes like 3 globals to set up too
[3:20:45] wackpoetic: 3 - 4
[3:21:05] majstorovicjebac: you are comparing apples with lemons @ImJordanHi
[3:21:21] Endoraesh: this looks like so much fun
[3:21:31] chubmax: @pwnyo808 I’m trying to decide whether to play DH or lock tuesday
[3:21:42] Pwnyo808: @chubmax gotta be lock
[3:21:47] ImJordanHi: @majstorovicjebac Nahhhh, you said they dont need more stuns. I agree, they shouldnt have 3, but their 1 should be good. Their 1 currently is bad.
[3:21:54] Pwnyo808: they might get tuned eventually, but you're going to have so much HP and armor it'll feel incredible
[3:21:57] ultra_content: overtuned lemons
[3:22:10] wackpoetic: Leg Sweep isn't bad
[3:22:15] ImJordanHi: @majstorovicjebac You're just saying "they're good with a 1 minute sweep leave it" which is just not a good way to balance the game. THey can turn their damage down, but having a 3 second 1 minute stun is pretty bad.
[3:22:23] chubmax: yeah. DH is so easy tho I cruised to 2100 @pwnyo808
[3:22:26] ImJordanHi: @majstorovicjebac At least in todays meta, if it were in TBC they'd fit right in
[3:22:56] Duides: You can fear them while they are imprisoned?
[3:23:00] Duides: Nice
[3:23:04] Pwnyo808: @chubmax i mean ya, if you're playing for rating then prob DH, cuz it's easy.  But Lock actually seems fu n
[3:23:20] arcane_p: windwalker just seems like a worse version of demon hunter and I hate that blizzard doesn’t make them different (windwalker that is)
[3:23:49] chubmax: @pwnyo808 I can play demo to 2200ish it’s just so much effort. after this tuning tho it might be fun you’re right.
[3:23:52] aaggros: ww is fun
[3:23:53] dooshken: rogue kit is just better to begin with
[3:24:03] chubmax: @pwnyo808 and demo can deal with rogues
[3:24:11] chubmax: plus the fear changes!!
[3:24:27] fantasiesgx: fear change is so bad
[3:24:47] lasergazer3: You played demo lock right? Am I missing something or is the 4-piece tier bonus severely underperforming? Throughout an entire shuffle it only did 250k.  Any insight?
[3:24:50] fantasiesgx: cant death fears, sac already only breaks fears 30% of the time. Now never
[3:24:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: The fear change could be brutal depending on how much they change it
[3:25:09] chubmax: @lasergazer3 sounds about right. it’s not that great
[3:25:18] chubmax: mine does 300k in longer matches
[3:25:23] fantasiesgx: locks are already so opressive with spam fears only gunna be worse
[3:25:46] NoutDubs: NoutDubs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[3:25:48] chubmax: locks are going to be unkillable specifically demo. and I think demo splay is gonna be jnsane
[3:25:57] lasergazer3: Sad. My mate playing dh instantly gained like 20% damage when he got his tier bonuses.. I gained maybe 2% on my demo...
[3:25:59] arcane_p: how would you like to see windwalker changed venruki maybe we can get the dev’s to fix them next expac as a community ?
[3:26:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember being constantly fear+dotted until death back in the day, not much fun
[3:26:15] Ssolemn: @venruki what do you think is the most fun healer atm?
[3:26:25] The__Swordmaster: I liked Tigerseye Brew
[3:26:37] The__Swordmaster: That’s what I really want back
[3:26:41] fantasiesgx: @chubmax yeah for sure, dreading it as I play hpal
[3:26:51] chubmax: it’s gonna be world of warlockcraft i think
[3:27:11] fantasiesgx: my hpal already dies in a stun to a demon hunter through wall but armour nerf is gunna make it even harder to live

[3:27:22] lasergazer3: could be. I hope they monitor the changes and take action if the fears get out of hand
[3:27:35] sdracogotdrip: isnt it better not have the spell indicator on ground ( i am talking about sigils etc)
[3:27:49] lasergazer3: preference
[3:28:52] lasergazer3: I played both ways, and actually returned to the telegraphed ground targeting. Makes it easier to asses if spells are actually gonna land when playing many different alts
[3:30:07] The__Swordmaster: Down with the Light—may the Fel reign eternally
[3:30:23] sdracogotdrip: i play pve and it feels like a whole gcd
[3:30:33] Badasti: 15 yds i think
[3:30:33] dooshken: like 15 yards or something
[3:30:42] ArmyofOneGuy: what did tiger eye brew do? i cant remember
[3:30:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: The range on the hunt is the one that is freakish
[3:31:35] Noxalis20: @venruki is there anything that brings back eye beam faster, or just need to wait for the timer
[3:31:39] narosho_: Do you think pvp changes coming will push towards casters being stronger in the coming weeks ?
[3:32:06] flames222: i think hunters are lowkey licking their lips even after the changes
[3:32:09] ultra_content: monk arcane
[3:32:15] ultra_content: druid
[3:32:21] ultra_content: or monk arcane disc
[3:32:24] happyheals: boomy dh priest

[3:33:10] lasmanwow: Ok, it's shuffle time. I'm addicted to the gamble
[3:33:15] invincibledalyeth: what armor changes @xkrytekx
[3:33:51] itz_killjoy: plate get like a  6% dmg reduction to phys and cloth get 3%
[3:34:09] itz_killjoy: -6%
[3:34:18] invincibledalyeth: oh boy lol
[3:34:27] chubmax: @fantasiesgx I think demo is gonna be a nightmare now
[3:34:32] chubmax: games will go longer
[3:34:56] Vigi9413: Ready to sit CC for longer on Tuesday Ven?
[3:35:08] dakotan517: that would be SO nice
[3:35:11] chubmax: the changes will def make games longer
[3:35:12] Metaphors: i thought u meant like
[3:35:15] crazzbez: true, they make you sit on your ass like an asshole
[3:35:16] Metaphors: play other classes
[3:35:17] Metaphors: while in q
[3:35:32] Freebolt: ven u excited for mage lock / splay meta?
[3:35:36] kingtoke1991: @chubmax why will demo be a nightmare?
[3:35:41] dakotan517: YUP
[3:35:46] Xclosetnerd: teamviewer imo
[3:35:47] Warzone1359: Lol that always happens to me too
[3:35:52] raithei: ven would it be possible to do quick rundowns of strategy and thought process of target selecting before the match counts down in the shuffle rounds? generally speaking
[3:35:56] Freebolt: oh im so down for that then
[3:36:00] Freebolt: melee caster is the best fun
[3:36:01] Mrshmyt: idk man those fear buffs and spriest buffs and the armor...
[3:36:12] UnevenSolution: @venruki I dont understand rating in this game, would you be able to explain... below 1500, usually winning 4-5 rounds. anything above 1500 always 0-6. On top of that if i win anything under 3 or less rounds i lose about 60-90 rating. I have roughly 150ish rounds played
[3:36:21] Warzone1359: frost mage lock seems they will be really strong
[3:36:25] Bard_Telvanni: Hey ven I just saw your video on pvp rewards, why doesn’t wow have ratinng decay like every game ever instead of mmr inflation?
[3:36:38] Badasti: i feel like every season people clutch their pearls over the 'caster meta' yet often stats show melee with pretty great representation LUL
[3:36:43] chubmax: @kingtoke1991 demo will be tanky af now. MS with pet and great consistent damage. fear change is unreal and demo actually does a lot of physical dmg so the big counter to lock which was arms got gutted
[3:36:54] Warzone1359: Maybe, frost mage, demo lock just seems like a nightmare
[3:37:11] tablez: Im interested to see how hard this hits dks and warriors since they also lose damage from the armor nerf takes those two down
[3:37:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah we could see rogue + shadow priest
[3:37:21] sourbutts: i think overall it will be far more balanced, since melee is so much more represented, but there will be a few outliers as always but healthy overall
[3:37:29] zachgamegodx: ven loves to dress up his dragon

[3:37:59] zachgamegodx: the cdew buikd is so op for dragon
[3:38:12] sourbutts: do top 5000
[3:38:23] The__Swordmaster: Greenlizard 🥹
[3:38:27] zachgamegodx: @jawst3k if it feels awful now, the buffs are too small to change that
[3:38:28] sourbutts: 100% a melee meta
[3:38:34] HSLN: feral need buffs
[3:38:34] silveerwow: 3% fire mage wow... only cuz of survivability
[3:38:37] jawst3k: thats what i figure
[3:38:39] sourbutts: top 5000 is roughly 1800 up i think
[3:38:50] prtwentyfour: Poor affliction locks #10
[3:38:51] TheHernSpecial: its been a melee season...... finally ranged get something
[3:38:54] zachgamegodx: it’s a rogue x and dh dk meta
[3:38:58] sourbutts: check eu too please for us euros
[3:39:05] jawst3k: and ww* and demo*
[3:39:06] atomic_gossipgirlxo: "Don't let the truth ruin a good story". It's a caster meta and the people want to complain they are only getting better!
[3:39:12] Nemiha21: looks pretty balanced. just more melee specs and players overall
[3:39:16] sourbutts: yeah dude its melee cleave heaven over here rn
[3:39:17] Fixit_cat: lol
[3:39:25] highlord1991: dh demo goes brrr
[3:39:30] chubmax: I hope melee gets gutted
[3:39:31] zachgamegodx: look at that ele Sham rep
[3:39:39] chubmax: how did DH escape nerfs haha
[3:39:40] everquest101: only reason iudhk is doing well is because its actualy a caster meta
[3:39:40] yesterday_potato: im kind of over DH tbh
[3:39:41] jawst3k: just ww and dh pls
[3:39:42] hoovesers: ss is more shifted towards melee meta
[3:39:49] SteppzUP: I hope DH its gutted
[3:39:51] prtwentyfour: Yeah and Melee was 100% fine in 4 shotting a cloth wearing class, dont feel any cympothy
[3:39:54] silveerwow: ven how do you think about that 30% armor reduction to plate and 30% armor buff on cloth? etc
[3:40:01] zachgamegodx: i hope the root and fear change is gone otherwise I’ll only play casters
[3:40:05] raithei: Does the buffs to SPs and expected warlock meta allows some sleeper "counterpicks" that have been around before? or theres not any more "favorite matchup" in Dragonflight anymore?
[3:40:12] prtwentyfour: They where not complaining then sry
[3:40:19] Warzone1359: If melee kick was a longer cd and their movement was toned down just a bit, it wouldn't feel nearly as bad
[3:40:19] thisisthotcaller: Hey Ven, sorry for the random question, but im a bit lost on enh sham - any ideas on who i should check out to learn more?
[3:40:26] itsBEASTEN: what pvp talents u using? @venruki
[3:40:29] gdodmebxu: @zachgamegodx warrior benefits more from it than casters KEKW
[3:40:30] zachgamegodx: I’m not spending 50%of the game in roots and fears
[3:40:31] sourbutts: i think after this patch game will be way more balanced

[3:41:51] raithei: well i expect the usual SP rogue comps, even some old lock + whatever was played before, but from past AWC we´ve seen SP rogue comps, i just cant remember against whom they struggled and why was that.
[3:42:00] sourbutts: i played ret rdudu frost mage with irl friends and it actually went really well

[3:43:02] masterkain: I don't get the ret buffs and I discovered recently they are a ranged class now?
[3:43:03] jawst3k: i feel like holy will be just less d tier
[3:43:04] Aazree: im just excited for survival hunter buffs even if small rukiRage
[3:43:05] dooshken: yuck
[3:43:05] Zarkos: im just stoked for AWC
[3:43:06] jawst3k: but if its good its rmp meta
[3:43:19] chubmax: if it’s rmp don’t dh flop to that
[3:43:27] jawst3k: we pray for rmp meta
[3:43:28] everquest101: ret need buffs because they scale  realy bad
[3:43:32] dakotan517: /leave
[3:43:35] dakotan517: :P
[3:43:38] Brotali1ty: wait till you see bicmex with rat and zen dominate xD
[3:43:46] Varchon: they'd have to buff frost for rmp though, no?
[3:43:53] RYKINX5: yeah, leaving really screws the dps
[3:43:57] dakotan517: it is quite annoying
[3:43:58] gdodmebxu: @Varchon arcane is fine
[3:44:09] raithei: does augmentation still boosts a buttload of damage? cause SP + Aug could unleash some damage no? i dont play DF im just cooking in my head xD
[3:44:10] sourbutts: i hope raiku wins on mage
[3:44:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rat is fun to watch
[3:44:13] gdodmebxu: really fine Kappa
[3:44:40] zachgamegodx: hah aha this slughirn guy is a giga weirdo,  he’s like Bruce Rogue  but the warrior version
[3:44:43] Aazree: was hoping for fire mage changes tbh surprised there wasn't any
[3:45:34] everquest101: only class is dead atm is frost dk
[3:45:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fire mage did get more armor and stamina, like other clothies, we'll have to see how that works out

[3:46:30] Yoseirl: Yoseirl subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:46:34] gdodmebxu: @everquest101 do people really think frost dk is bad?
[3:46:42] ellisrainy: hope you feel better soon bro <3
[3:47:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: With being a glass cannon, if having more survivability was all that was missing, fire mage might wreck more people
[3:47:04] Brotali1ty: @gdodmebxu frost just got insane burst and in 2s can be good I think
[3:47:15] gdodmebxu: the highest rated dk in ss is frost
[3:47:40] zachgamegodx: frost is very  lobby dependent unlike unholy
[3:47:45] zachgamegodx: inconsistent
[3:48:13] zachgamegodx: lontarCLAP
[3:48:24] gdodmebxu: most specs are pretty lobby dependent. uhdk is just omega broken KEKW
[3:48:39] tunatyler: how so they update the adaptive swarm animation but not earthern lol
[3:48:45] tunatyler: do*
[3:49:18] painfll: hi
[3:49:22] zachgamegodx: @gdodmebxu not like frost dk tbh
[3:49:25] kettlecatt: you on that Buckleys ride ven?
[3:49:34] hoovesers: you got bad guts or something?
[3:49:35] zachgamegodx: very few are as lobby dependent as that 1

[3:49:59] tidusisthedream: why dont u decurse urself irl

[3:50:04] tidusisthedream: =D
[3:50:36] jawst3k: BUT IT WORKS
[3:50:40] Polyrhythmz: devokers are crazy man
[3:50:41] jawst3k: thats the commercial right
[3:50:45] Vigi9413: when the wife and i bought our house we didn't realize the person left the storm windows open so we've had -17 degree win comin in on us while we slept lol
[3:50:54] zachgamegodx: kick Devoker on spellfrost
[3:50:57] Badasti: i actually like the taste of lemsip
[3:51:04] kettlecatt: at least they're self aware in the hell they impose on taste buds lmao
[3:51:16] kettlecatt: none of this "it tastes like cherry we sware!!" stuff
[3:51:20] zachgamegodx: rotate kicks and it’s pretty difficult to deal with unless he’s cancelling the disints
[3:51:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: We got the dragon that time!
[3:51:42] that_man_ski: bully me?
[3:51:59] that_man_ski: XD
[3:52:32] gdodmebxu: an entire forest Kappa
[3:52:46] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Ven in the vegetable aisle
[3:53:00] Vigi9413: they want spacedragie hard
[3:53:12] Swingingwilly: the play
[3:53:14] Zarkos: ele having a good time in this lobby
[3:53:16] kreyzy8: for some reason I feel like the 5% healing nerf to druid won't affect the treants LUL
[3:53:50] Swingingwilly: 4 banger here we go
[3:55:01] rembrandt89: do you always just stasis first global of the game ?
[3:55:07] Ameratzu: those stuns were fire
[3:55:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wicked deep breath
[3:55:12] mynameistwavis: +6 lol wtf
[3:55:13] JmanOwnz: why is that only +6?
[3:55:14] crazzbez: 6 points for 4 wins is brutal
[3:55:18] blackheart1110: 6 pts yay!
[3:56:12] Vigi9413: Do you enjoy solo shuffle over normal 3's ven?
[3:56:28] hoovesers: what you doing on them purple tubes man?
[3:57:19] chrye_xx: someone go knock him off tube
[4:00:07] diperna99: can you play frost?
[4:00:16] lasergazer3: send it
[4:00:20] Aazree: arcane
[4:00:22] crazzbez: think it's time to make a ret for an alt
[4:00:58] luvix07: How's it going tonight Ven
[4:01:00] yesterday_potato: my issue with this game is that i want to play everything
[4:01:02] disarmoniac: yo ven any thoughts on upcoming tuning?
[4:01:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: "This whole bracket must be purged!"
[4:01:09] prtwentyfour: On the tier list where do holy pallys stand?
[4:01:24] dvoraklol: kfc is the cure
[4:01:24] Vigi9413: are the ret changes applied to pvp on tuesday?
[4:01:40] luvix07: Is it Dark chocolate? :o
[4:02:00] prtwentyfour: @Vigi9413 Yes
[4:02:13] Vigi9413: that's kinda huge then
[4:02:30] lasergazer3: Favorite spec atm?
[4:02:45] Yoseirl: hey ven what arena frames do u use? and do u use WAs? im getting so many lua errors i cant play

[4:03:20] sourbutts: and breaks less
[4:03:24] Getblown: hi
[4:03:29] lasergazer3: Did you try the new prevoker buff? More essence bursts
[4:03:31] Aazree: i wonder why they nerfed shamans armour specifically
[4:03:43] Yoseirl: can someone link that to me? thanks, i usually go with sarena but its bugging
[4:03:43] Brotali1ty: @sourbutts i've been using his sarena and its quite good tbf
[4:03:57] Falcanus: bicmex's gladius is the new gladius
[4:04:01] Falcanus: he keeps it up to date
[4:04:15] ogbuckwheats: HELL YA BROTHER
[4:04:16] lasergazer3: Do you have a link to that prevoker build? :)
[4:04:23] zachgamegodx: dude that cdew build changed my life on dragon
[4:04:30] zachgamegodx: and it can change all of yours
[4:04:35] Aazree: i wanna run survival and resto sham next patch two of most fun specs for me
[4:04:43] zachgamegodx: oh?
[4:04:47] jporter_: i think aff is going to be really good tuesday
[4:04:57] chrisbyrge86: what you think about the cloth armor buff will mages be tankier
[4:04:59] zachgamegodx: who made the build
[4:05:12] zachgamegodx: I’d love to give credit where it’s due
[4:05:45] lasergazer3: the build? :P
[4:05:48] just_gg_s: what u talk about bicmex's gladisu ? o.o
[4:05:52] just_gg_s: whats going on
[4:06:04] lasergazer3: his prevoker build
[4:06:05] venruki: BwbBsJu/D+01p9npZvkV+nWIkDAAAAAIJplSgIJJIJRIRAAQSIJhISSAJAAAgkkIJkkICAA
[4:06:13] just_gg_s: ohh :D my bad
[4:06:16] lasergazer3: Cheers ;)
[4:06:29] just_gg_s: was thinking ther is new addon like gladisu
[4:06:53] Aazree: What you think your main classes will be next patch ven besides mage I guess
[4:07:21] Getblown: n days until ven responds lol
[4:07:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH until it gets nerfed! LUL
[4:07:40] Getblown: good haha how are you doing?
[4:07:57] Getblown: pvp killin
[4:08:04] lasergazer3: Do you have a Spark of Insight tacker or do you just know?
[4:08:23] lasergazer3: prevoker talent
[4:09:00] Aazree: got a feeling ret is gonna be good next patch tbh does vanguard's still play retail ?
[4:09:23] wackpoetic: Pres is going to be so busted once rated BG Blitz comes out
[4:09:26] Getblown: retail seems so intimidating now lol, like a million spells, talents, and procs, and everyone has like  million things in their bags
[4:10:06] Hobblefoot: I swear the moment I saw tier lists saying Dev Evoker was 'easy' for beginners and did insane damage, they are in almost all of my lobbies.
[4:10:37] laha1n: ive started healing because the dps queues are 15+ minutes most of the time. ive decided that the tradeoff between playing arena haphazardly or ever 3 minutes is worth the pain of healing
[4:11:00] lasergazer3: are you gonna try the evoker Forger of Mountains talent when the root buffs hit=
[4:11:00] zachgamegodx: i think bc Cdew was the first one to start using the build at a high rating, I’d like to give him credit for making  build, an example, I could say I’ve got the best arcane mage build ever but if I’m at 2100 on arcane, then someone at 2700 makes it, then dominates with it, who would you say “made” the build
[4:11:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having skill shots is a good thing, I think
[4:11:04] Hobblefoot: Oh there is no doubt about that.
[4:11:08] lilskeets: in 2.2 and 2.3 lobbies I feel like I have a boomy in every game
[4:11:13] Zenlyn: dev evoker feels like semi real class, not too many defensives, not too many offensives. dies quickly but kills u fast too
[4:11:30] Brotali1ty: someone said the same about pres as being easy for beginner healers, dont think pres is that easy for beginners
[4:11:47] zachgamegodx: he’s only 2k on pres
[4:11:52] jawst3k: feels like they never die :(
[4:11:53] johnwelchhh: absterg never gets the credit he deserves
[4:11:56] wackpoetic: I think Dev has highest damage potential of all healers, but right now has to spend all of its time healing
[4:12:00] Zenlyn: i only mean specifically about dev, i think thats how all dps should be designed imo
[4:12:10] johnwelchhh: absterg is glad on pres lmao\
[4:12:11] tarth_100: Ven, you play perpetual paralysis into druids so that your para spreads to treants? lol
[4:12:21] Hobblefoot: What the!
[4:12:37] Caedalade: what did you day about dev? @zenlyn
[4:12:39] lilskeets: Assa can actually die, and does really good dmg I don't hate facing it
[4:12:40] Caedalade: I just joined
[4:12:46] gelatokush: the only fair version of dh is havoc Kappa
[4:13:10] PastaSeat: You guys excited for our Warlock overlords on Tuesday?
[4:13:22] TheRhymer: the purges pres has are nutty
[4:13:42] zachgamegodx: @johnwelchhh says 2145 for me
[4:13:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: @PastaSeat I want to see what Chanimal and Infernion can do with these changes, it could be really nuts
[4:14:15] zachgamegodx: stadmsn is 2800, strongest dragon of them all
[4:14:45] GogumaCat: wp there
[4:14:49] gdodmebxu: absterge is an insane healer on any class
[4:14:49] Aazree: just wish they'd do more world PvP things and give incentive to do so soon queues wouldn't feel as bad with stuff to do in downtime
[4:15:11] Hobblefoot: Not if you love them.
[4:15:11] lasergazer3: the Venruki build? :O
[4:15:23] Axtin: sometimes talent changes happen and its pretty obvious when a talent will be the norm
[4:15:29] jugganautjoe: i think cdew created mountain dew
[4:15:32] Acurarx: like nobody else is playing the available talents
[4:15:57] yctnm: its a talent tree, ownership is exclusively blizzard's yall accepted the terms and conditions Kappa
[4:15:59] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @Axtin No. There can only be 1 innovator and the rest are copycats. No one would ever think of something without discussing it with someone else before hand
[4:16:06] trottiga: Coolest non-troll mogs for WW monk : Dark Iron Dwarf or Kul Tirans?!
[4:16:07] zachgamegodx: the venruki build changed my life
[4:16:12] Caedalade: cdr has always been insane in wow because it’s a trading/cd game
[4:16:14] Axtin: @atomic_gossipgirlxo LUL
[4:16:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's a moo-adin, too! LUL
[4:16:24] nskurn: they gotta fix when cc cancels ur dream breath and stasis spells
[4:16:25] dawsonator171: Listen, Alfred may have created and built all those gadgets, but Batman will always get recognized with the sick utilization of said tools.
[4:16:34] Caedalade: why flowstate is so good, or shifting power, time skip, etc
[4:17:22] Aazree: rukiRage rukiRage
[4:17:48] johnwelchhh: @zachgamegodx his drago is called ggdwagon
[4:17:55] atomic_gossipgirlxo: That was like a comms'd swap
[4:17:57] ferahgok: actually insanely coordinated
[4:18:02] svengihiiri: double bouble
[4:18:03] johnwelchhh: hes  2350 or something in ss
[4:18:08] xSavageALx: will spriest be any better come tuesday?
[4:18:10] wackpoetic: I swear you also need a certain amount of Haste as Evoker for your Empower spells to cast cleanly. Without like 10%+ Haste they bug out with spell queueing
[4:18:13] ferahgok: dragon stun, double bubble hoj hoj
[4:18:23] lasergazer3: what stats are you running on precoker?
[4:18:27] lasergazer3: prevoker *
[4:18:28] trottiga: @xSavageALx Slightly yeah, bit more overall dmg and spread pressure, slightly tankier
[4:18:28] johnwelchhh: its justt his alt and cdews m,ain
[4:18:30] nskurn: doesnt pres play full haste?
[4:18:36] nskurn: with a lil mastery
[4:19:06] zachgamegodx: they play a mix
[4:19:11] zachgamegodx: from what I’ve seen
[4:19:16] lasergazer3: could be. Then my devoker gear wont work i suppose
[4:19:41] nskurn: maybe i need some more mastery... the thruput is large even without it tho
[4:19:50] zachgamegodx: some like more mastery some like more haste, they just recently buffed some talents so new stat combos are bound to come out
[4:20:09] lasergazer3: ah nice. Love some experimentation
[4:20:10] dawsonator171: look at that sp tankiness, and it goes up next week.
[4:20:51] lilskeets: he could use some more armor
[4:20:52] zachgamegodx: he’s got a strong Paladin giving him boos and sacs
[4:21:05] Zarkos: clip it
[4:21:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember when shadow priests were too tough, before
[4:21:19] sourbutts: what are you smoking bud
[4:21:27] Aazree: rukiEw
[4:21:32] zachgamegodx: remember edge of insanity
[4:21:32] healhut: lol
[4:21:37] dawsonator171: God Comp coming back to be literal gods.
[4:21:40] shredder1111: smack a few priests around now while u can
[4:21:44] zachgamegodx: 20% damage reduction when not in void form
[4:21:44] nskurn: i heard evokers play armor > mastery
[4:21:58] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[4:22:02] lasergazer3: So do you have two wow subscriptions?
[4:22:08] Endoraesh: a good sp scares me though
[4:22:40] nskurn: damn ven how u heal without friendly nameplates
[4:22:53] zachgamegodx: @lasergazer3 yeah he moved some toons over to a 2nd acct bc qing 2 characters at the same time helped him kill some downtime on his content
[4:23:15] Aazree: Its always the patch I don't want to play warlock they're strong rukiTrig rukiTrig
[4:23:33] varok87: Rap God.
[4:23:48] clicket: @Aazree you must never want to play warlock because they're always strong
[4:24:28] Swingingwilly: final 1800 solo shuffle on the fury war 1847 oh yeah
[4:24:58] Yoseirl: same same, friendly name plates throw me way off
[4:25:02] lasergazer3: good idea
[4:25:05] Aazree: mostly played affli to be fair they've been kinda ass was just more meaning they always get big buffs when I decide against it haha
[4:25:12] trottiga: Small friendly nameplates is cool
[4:25:37] wackpoetic: I swear if enemy team knows to interrupt your stasis it can ruin the whole round
[4:26:06] sourbutts: @Aazree i just started playing mine and its more fun than i remember, not having to press 6 buttons to dot each person
[4:27:23] blueboywiz: do you think we'll get epic rbgs next expansion
[4:27:25] Aazree: @sourbutts I guess that's true gotta love when you spend 20 seconds putting on dots then hunter trap takes them off rukiEw rukiEw
[4:27:26] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Teea WA
[4:27:39] nskurn: ya i find it best to just unleash the stasis before im off dr's
[4:27:50] wackpoetic: if they interrupt your initial combo, or if they interrupt the re-cast it just does so much
[4:28:06] ryanblue98: that flying stun needs a nerf to range
[4:28:14] atomic_gossipgirlxo: I don't even know how pres works. Stopped playing in S1, missed all of S2, and now they are shit and I've had maybe 2 shuffles with them.
[4:28:17] Aazree: hit a 300k UA dispell yesterday tho that was fun
[4:28:19] frefal13: Also sucks if you get chain cycloned and stasis ex[ires it just gets wasted
[4:30:03] therealactionman: i am not ret pally scum lol
[4:30:32] Ameratzu: i was the sp, fun lobby
[4:30:36] Aazree: Any classes you think need a full rework like they did to ret ven ?
[4:30:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: That moo-adin tho
[4:30:38] SmokiieTV: just hit 1800 in 2s, ww feel amazing
[4:30:45] SmokiieTV: first time
[4:31:05] trottiga: ww feels so smooth
[4:31:08] ghostware9000: can you dragon ride anywhere now?
[4:31:21] Getblown: so does anyone what cool changes they are making "in the war within"
[4:31:25] JmanOwnz: i just wish WW had like one more cc
[4:31:28] Getblown: making for
[4:31:29] JmanOwnz: just feels like a damage bot
[4:31:32] dvoraklol: what about mistweaver?
[4:31:35] SmokiieTV: thank you bro, never really stepped into pvp but decided too this season and hit 1800, no idea how far i will go
[4:31:36] Hobblefoot: Hard for me to play WW so I don't bother
[4:31:37] Badasti: havent even tried ww this patch
[4:31:37] RossiyaRus: im 2800 on classic right now and since there is no ques im trying retail and i cant break 1700 lmao any suggestions?
[4:31:46] Polyrhythmz: I liked the chi torpedo burst shenanigans back in the day
[4:32:27] Badasti: @RossiyaRus more dam, retail has less setup imo
[4:32:30] NovaSun84: find the exact same broken class that's getting you 2800
[4:32:40] Kawjiryu: get good basically
[4:32:53] RossiyaRus: atm trying warrior but feels underwhelming
[4:33:02] Moobot: Latest video "PvP Rewards Are Still Too Hard To Get In Dragonflight, Data Shows" view it here: youtu.be/NSw9Imk5bec
[4:33:11] RossiyaRus: kk ty
[4:33:15] Ameratzu: yeah warriors just bum bum
[4:33:24] varok87: @RossiyaRus Maybe just try DH. LUL
[4:33:26] yesterday_potato: What xpac did you win blizzcon?
[4:33:28] SmokiieTV: hot take, considering I never really stepped into arena I find people gate keep alot, making it quite hard to get a group, solo is a great alt but its 15min+ queue timers
[4:33:29] Kawjiryu: warrior isnt quite as good as it is in season 8 of wrath though lol
[4:33:31] lasergazer3: bajheera
[4:33:38] Kawjiryu: free 2800s in wrath lol
[4:33:40] healhut: magnus streaming right now
[4:33:45] healhut: good war
[4:33:49] Aazree: is fury viable yet always felt that was more fun than arms
[4:33:50] trottiga: @jmorgz1 Yeah its rough, gotta hop on a healer and spam honestly
[4:33:51] yesterday_potato: the golden age
[4:34:03] RossiyaRus: @Kawjiryu 3 time glad on wrath and 4 time in tbc, not only playing warrior but thanks
[4:34:05] SteppzUP: @rossiyarus more then dmg learn to be a disruptor warriors are amazing at that. damage comes ez
[4:34:40] SteppzUP: SeemsGood
[4:35:10] RossiyaRus: @SteppzUP ty ill check some guides and streamers
[4:35:19] SmokiieTV: @trottiga I would but healing feels kinda shit if people don't know when to press deff's I enjoy anena, my biggest prob with it is the gate keeping, people wanting players with 2.4k exp when they personally have 1600 cr rn, I understand they want to climb fast but chill lol
[4:35:37] laha1n: why are people allowed to queue tank in solo shuffle? just played with 2 blood dks
[4:35:52] Aazree: aight lads 2am here have a good one and a good stream ven goodbye
[4:35:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's always a learning curve, modern WoW is faster with a lot more abilities and specs
[4:35:59] laha1n: its definitely possible
[4:36:02] lilskeets: all my homies hate tanks
[4:36:15] Junkhole903: They need to just rework all tanks to be dps in pvp
[4:36:24] ryanblue98: ive done like 1000 rounds on solo up to over 1800 saw tanks maybe once
[4:36:25] lasergazer3: !playlist
[4:36:25] Nightbot: Venruki's Spotify playlists can be found at https://open.spotify.com/user/1282291530 SeemsGood
[4:36:30] Badasti: i had 2 lobbies with guardian druids today... most annoying thing ever
[4:36:34] yesterday_potato: my only problem with tanks is they dont seem to be able to hold aggro
[4:36:38] NovaSun84: you know who tanks love?  themselves, it's brutal out there!
[4:36:50] laha1n: once you get out of the 1500 mmr range you wont get them but they are there
[4:37:00] lilskeets: tanks should just get the prot pally lobbies, be in their own little bracket
[4:37:41] SteppzUP: @lilskeets yeah! a full tank vs tank lobby
[4:37:43] lasergazer3: geniune question, i'm trying to learn warlock. What should he be doing and what should he definitely not be doing?
[4:38:14] Cunningz: !Holzkern
[4:38:14] Nightbot: Need a gift for your loved ones for Valentine's Day? Check out Holzkern and make sure to use my code VENRUKI15 for 15% off! http://www.holzkern.com/venruki
[4:38:36] Badasti: @lasergazer3 you should look on youtube for warlock guides xd
[4:38:40] Valubuck: @venruki what is the warlock doing wrong?
[4:38:42] SteppzUP: @lasergazer3 he is port/lining making ven push in to heal
[4:38:47] skez_live: holy
[4:39:02] mymuhcels: better port positioning
[4:39:06] SmokiieTV: @venruki what do you think they could do to reduce the gate keeping aspect of arena? when I say gate keeping I am talking about people who aren't 2.1-2.4k rating this season not allowing people to join up because they only have 2kexp for example when they have the same cr
[4:39:10] dvoraklol: he is scared
[4:39:11] What_ln_Tarnation: i cant heal ss, it'll get me suspended from the game
[4:39:11] lasergazer3: ah okay
[4:39:16] wackpoetic: DK's = good Pres lobby, Warlocks = bad Pres lobby
[4:39:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the limited range of evoker is definitely different
[4:39:39] skez_live: @jmorgz1 just make your own groups could help
[4:40:27] wackpoetic: It's a combination of port/range and sharing DR on CC where I feel like Lock is just worse than most other specs for Pres
[4:40:50] SmokiieTV: @skez_live true, I am just thinking that the more people playing the better but if people are holding grudges on the fact they were 2.3k in bfa stopping people from being able to play when they personally are sitting at 1600cr
[4:41:05] skez_live: yeah no doubt
[4:41:18] Badasti: @wackpoetic idk they share dr with priests and druids as well...
[4:41:34] skez_live: but thats why solo shuffle is nice, even if you cant get games or dont have the cr yet for higher rated groups in 3s you can always play
[4:42:00] SmokiieTV: i realized  I typed a message for ven but he is busy so he might not see
[4:42:27] SmokiieTV: @skez_live solo is amazing, only problem is the queue times, I played for 2 hours and only got 2 games in
[4:42:50] Badasti: the vast majority of people aren't 2.2k +
[4:43:07] Badasti: but the reason you see so many people in lfg that are high rated is because they spam queue
[4:43:24] Badasti: and because it takes longer to fill groups
[4:45:25] SmokiieTV: I guess u are right
[4:46:00] SmokiieTV: its really hard to find consistent players to queue with
[4:46:55] SmokiieTV: is aug evoker played in arena? sorry if its a stupid question, they are played alot in m+
[4:46:59] Badasti: just gotta keep going and adding people to friends lists that you enjoy playing with. Can also try join pvp guilds etc to make friends
[4:47:09] Badasti: not so much this season, Dev is better afaik
[4:47:56] SmokiieTV: guessing dev is just better because of raw dmg?
[4:48:02] Badasti: yeah
[4:48:20] Badasti: it has the highest burst in the game atm, but its a bit of a 1 trick pony
[4:48:34] Badasti: just cranks hella dam
[4:48:48] yesterday_potato: gratz
[4:48:50] JmanOwnz: the angle you got on that deep breath was sick

[4:50:40] ghostware9000: adult pokemon
[4:50:44] Junkhole903: im playing it rn its pretty fun tbf
[4:50:45] SmokiieTV: its basically a mix of ark and pokemon
[4:50:45] babybirdzhel: playing it now, pokemon meets ark?
[4:50:45] YngvarsHouse: Palworld is Pog
[4:50:46] lasergazer3: it looks stupid xD
[4:50:48] Eutrivx: ark+pokemon
[4:50:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Palworld is "pokemon with guns"
[4:50:52] lasergazer3: its pokemons with guns
[4:50:53] venusprojectz: more like FOTM game but hella fun atm
[4:50:57] nightmxz: Pokemon with guns + it's not actually made by any nintendo people
[4:50:58] lilskeets: its pokemon with guns and internment camps
[4:51:04] nightmxz: I'm not sure on the legality behind it lol
[4:51:05] Badasti: palworld - people in tht game have thicc thighs
[4:51:27] YngvarsHouse: No its not made by AI. Thats COPIUM
[4:51:32] Badasti: did someone call me?
[4:51:37] Stoichulk: Looks stupid
[4:51:43] wmanrespecter: its basically pokemon capitalism
[4:51:44] TheBoysCT: It's like a weird cross between Valheim and Pokemon
[4:51:46] Donorgyll: I'm told you can capture and butcher humans
[4:51:47] SmokiieTV: I was watching sonii play it, not the biggest fan myself
[4:51:48] wmanrespecter: you make them work for you
[4:52:04] W00dyyx: So Palworld for morning coffee tomorrow right?
[4:52:09] Luigicamp: I think it's the same people who made Craftopia
[4:52:16] nightmxz: @Luigicamp Yeah it is
[4:52:28] ghostware9000: i do
[4:52:35] Badasti: nope, the spam in game enraged me too much
[4:52:38] SmokiieTV: played it till paywall too
[4:52:38] ghostware9000: yeah was fun until you had to pay lol
[4:52:41] lasergazer3: Yup. But its a bit meh
[4:52:43] Stoichulk: Its boring after the initial play surge
[4:52:58] lasergazer3: I still play it on a daily basis, but then..
[4:53:07] lasergazer3: I dont know, its just to kill time
[4:53:22] Wootzu: think ret will be s tier next week ven
[4:53:54] Badasti: poor ret palas
[4:53:54] Snohconez: KEKW
[4:53:56] clicket: almost a whole patch, had to fix that
[4:53:56] lilskeets: season 1 flashbacks
[4:53:57] nightmxz: Ret needs a chance to be good, mages have always been good so it's only fair
[4:54:10] dbmx1: Why do you think some classes like Enhance go completely unchanged for long periods?
[4:54:14] yesterday_potato: ret always had so many fans
[4:54:15] pweepysonkun: hansol up there, hype
[4:54:15] Magottx: smex is on another lvl this xpac rn
[4:54:21] lilskeets: mages need podtender and triune ward back

[4:54:41] Magottx: yea fs i just mean rn especially
[4:54:41] Badasti: i saw him playing boomie earlier
[4:54:45] Extramediums: just started getting the vibe of arcane, really enjoying it
[4:55:03] Swertson: I want to see venruki hunter
[4:55:07] Deacon_III: Whats the point of playing multiple of the same class?
[4:55:20] stankbigly: okay Ven- with the Sub Focus very nice
[4:55:23] lasergazer3: What
[4:55:29] kusoneko: whats with that healing details
[4:55:38] SmokiieTV: I love solo shuffle but I feel like the queues are slow because there is no reward for playing pvp, if they added some sick stuff that could be viable in pve people would be all over it
[4:55:39] lasergazer3: What's the most beginner friendly, frost or arcane?
[4:55:49] stankbigly: DnB guy?
[4:56:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP
[4:56:46] lasergazer3: xD

[4:57:53] SmokiieTV: you into series?
[4:57:56] stankbigly: Napoleon sucked
[4:57:57] lasergazer3: fun tip. If you spam the Whirling Surge ability right as you taking off with the new and improved Soar ability, you get 3 vigor for free almost everytime
[4:57:58] Snohconez: ready for dune 2
[4:57:59] inigomonntoya: Oppenheimer in my top3 all time
[4:58:05] venusprojectz: Equalizier 3 LUL

[5:05:31] clicket: that eles reflexes are so insane, much wow
[5:05:45] lilskeets: i had an ele I played against on my hunter the other day that insta grounding every single trap, I did a random trap while I was LOS of their healer to test and insta grounding still
[5:05:50] SmokiieTV: bots play arena?
[5:05:57] kusoneko: KEKW
[5:06:01] Zorek64: wtf
[5:06:08] Zorek64: its even so obvious
[5:06:33] kusoneko: his dps is pretty low, maybe just kickbot?
[5:06:36] Nachofez: is it a bot?
[5:06:43] dvoraklol: im the shaman pls dont report me
[5:06:44] SmokiieTV: i didn't even know anything about people botting in arena didn't think it was possible
[5:06:54] FlyFYI: aint no way fsdfddf is hacking AppaK
[5:07:13] sistahfistah1: fsdfdfd walls at 100% hp when no one attacks him OMEGAPOGGERS
[5:07:39] Badasti: cheaters really are the lowest of lowlifes
[5:07:45] Swertson: anyone else feel like its easier to get wins on ele than hunter?
[5:08:48] SmokiieTV: how does the bot work? does it play the arena for u or just press specific abilities for u when needed?
[5:08:57] yesterday_potato: wow its so obvious
[5:09:13] Badasti: @jmorgz1 kickbot, flameshocks everything and cranks meatballs
[5:10:13] ghostware9000: does reporting them in-game do much of anything? I know in classic Blizz mails me all the time telling me they banned someone i reported
[5:10:29] venusprojectz: so there is no dif between retail and classic/private servers when it comes to scripting these days
[5:10:42] The__Swordmaster: Wow. That Shaman must have Jedi powers.
[5:10:55] Badasti: omg dude he went to like 1%
[5:12:14] ghostware9000: the kickbot line of code is a google search away. not sure how some programmers at Blizz just get it and spend time figuring out a program to counter it
[5:13:13] crazzbez: WTF
[5:13:16] Magottx: that was an aggressive port lol
[5:13:56] nightmxz: Remember when Pokemons win traded against his alt at 8am and was banned 8 times (9 now) but still said he was falsely banned KEKW
[5:14:13] zagabombs: what does the human do if hte bots doing all that
[5:14:41] unZedd: resto druid has always been a tier above the rest of the healers
[5:14:48] unZedd: especially come dampening
[5:14:55] blueboywiz: wtf lol
[5:16:32] Damitongo: Pika says if you want to play 2v2 100 true :) not a lie
[5:17:00] xqzlol1: dw 5% less healing will balance them on tuesday Kappa
[5:17:23] xqzlol1: Rdruids are only 5% above every other healer Kappa
[5:17:34] gentlecatzz: Oh my god what was that burst
[5:17:49] gentlecatzz: Like 75% priest health in like, 10 seconds?
[5:18:09] ryanblue98: bot malfunction  MrDestructoid
[5:18:16] sammybeams: what if they added a 1v1 bracket lol
[5:19:11] Dragoresh: how complicated is arcane mage rotation
[5:19:14] xBenww: 1v1 bracket would be sickkk
[5:19:15] gentlecatzz: Arcane looking real crunchy
[5:19:23] xBenww: would be toxic af tho
[5:19:34] sked420: could you show your dmg breakdown quickly?
[5:19:36] sammybeams: yeah toxic frrr
[5:19:37] rekt1370: 1v1 bracket would be the worst thing of life lol
[5:19:39] yesterday_potato: so obvious a bot
[5:19:39] vodkacran: 1v1 bracket wouldn't be super balanced
[5:19:42] sammybeams: i feel like that would be kinda cool
[5:19:44] rekt1370: would be rogues sitting in stealth
[5:19:52] Dragoresh: i think his damage owuld be higher
[5:19:55] trashukkonen: can you explain acane burst for me i cant seem to find it out by my self
[5:20:00] ozzyxy: any ele that sits in the middle of the map jumping around every global is a bot no questions asked
[5:20:01] tarth_100: Surely, Fsdfdfdf is a legit player, I mean who could blame Fsdfdfdf?
[5:20:03] ZoomRiots: 1v1 would be rogue v rogues every match
[5:20:13] Zoart55: Semi-bot --kick
[5:20:40] rekt1370: thats all ele does tho LUL
[5:20:41] ryanblue98: i got called a kick bot once for training a boomy hard casting clones in my warrior face
[5:20:44] prtwentyfour: Is there a program that people use to see the comps on solos before they join?
[5:20:54] maxdoesmath: Why is the auto hot key thing so friendly to ele? Feel like that spec abuses it
[5:20:55] krome2dadome: @prtwentyfour twitch dot tv
[5:20:59] prtwentyfour: Just odd I always go 5-6 people then a decline
[5:22:08] meepoenjoyer: never even surge frost shocks? weird

[5:57:51] healhut: just queued a random bg and 60% of the players on both teams were rets lol
[5:57:55] Necrolancer47: i never see em
[5:58:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember that first week after the ret rework, it was truly insane
[5:58:30] raven1103: @Magottx Oh thanks <3
[5:59:06] Magottx: np fam
[5:59:14] Felbladez: @wEiRdO_dUdE like a war veteran. with the 1000 miles stare and all?
[6:01:00] raven1103: I'm curious to see how warlock will be after this 30% armor
[6:01:04] raven1103: Alrdy soo tanky :d
[6:01:06] chrye_xx: survival has sneaky dmg
[6:01:10] Bwrecker: No, not even close
[6:01:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: This isn't close to how OP rets were back then
[6:01:18] Muskybiggie: nah it can’t be
[6:01:20] tarasgeist: @BusterNaught thank you
[6:01:23] healhut: god i hope not
[6:01:30] FinkleTheMage: Honestly if MM doesn't two tap my hunter, I'll take the trade to Rets being insane lol
[6:01:45] Felbladez: love survival, its a bully class that hides under the radar
[6:02:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I do think the better rets are going to really rock hard, tho
[6:02:22] FinkleTheMage: They will be a bit more squishy though right due to armor changes?
[6:02:23] Deacon_III: @Felbladez Agree, think a lot of people sleep on surv
[6:02:48] Deacon_III: its getting a 4% damage buff all around
[6:03:53] BusterNaught: i dont think their dmg is the problem
[6:04:18] BusterNaught: sv dies easily
[6:04:26] Felbladez: ironic isnt it
[6:04:31] Xetane: how you doing today? @venruki
[6:04:46] Deacon_III: it does if you stay in melee too much, but you can do almost all your damage from ranged
[6:04:55] foxyllama: how you doing today? @venruki
[6:05:04] Deacon_III: 90
[6:05:14] Felbladez: survival is like a ranged rogue, wins by outplaying and out ccing enemies both for dmg an surviving
[6:05:16] Deacon_III: 90% damage reduction every 30 sec
[6:05:17] Xetane: my only rest day after 10 straight working shift. tired as hell.
[6:05:45] Tridos_: Did you play any DH today?
[6:05:45] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!

[6:13:03] Somanie: at least the lock is realistic about their WoW expectations
[6:13:12] Felbladez: he didnt go 6-0= mad dh
[6:14:09] The__Swordmaster: “Use your anger, Demon Hunter. It makes you stronger. Gives you FOCUS.”
[6:14:11] chrye_xx: Every day in your stream I reminded that I’m not the only one seeing that demon hunter players are all exactly the same
[6:14:13] Felbladez: worst port
[6:14:20] Somanie: ohhhh he was mad because he got 0 wins ok
[6:14:27] Bullmarketlol: Love seeing 0-6 DHs, gas dad

[6:14:56] lokum17: Do u never play high rated anymore?
[6:15:05] Xetane: do i need to create a new character to play SoD??
[6:15:07] QuonDot: "troll lobby" *Proceeds to lose the entire game*
[6:15:17] ryanblue98: thats the best thing to say when you go 0-6 everyone sucks
[6:15:27] Somanie: @Xetane yes, on an SoD realm <3 I think the little tab on the realm list is called "Seasonal" or smth
[6:15:34] Dinguslordx: Crazy thing is that even after going 0-6 they aren't going to realize that they are the problem.
[6:15:40] Bullmarketlol: My body is ready for the strength of arms nerf
[6:15:49] Wootzu: need to see some retribuki action ;)
[6:15:50] The__Swordmaster: Whenever I go 0-6 I just silently cry to myself. no need to spread the rage
[6:15:55] QuonDot: @Dinguslordx but he'll que again and the cycle will continue LUL
[6:16:04] Somanie: a little proc sheetuh POGGERS
[6:16:06] amgine04: ven how are you not gonna turn in that racing cup quest before logging wow
[6:16:18] Dinguslordx: @Dinguslordx ITS THE CIRCLE OF LIFEEEE

[6:16:21] Chipslol: yeah pally please
[6:16:32] Wootzu: naaa ret ofc
[6:17:00] Somanie: @Xetane that's completely fair!! retail WoW can be a liiiittle overwhelming for people coming back after that much of a break
[6:17:11] Somanie: welcome back though bro
[6:17:59] Felbladez: shaman throws buckets of water at ppl. BE healed!
[6:18:04] wackpoetic: Gotta rate transmogs in the DPS queues

[6:19:17] The__Swordmaster: Clean mage mog
[6:19:39] Luigicamp: actually it's from 2022
[6:19:47] Somanie: @Xetane It wouldn't be tedious necessarily because leveling is a lot better now, but a little bit of the crafting and stuff might be confusing without a guide
[6:19:53] amgine04: the killer was enjoyable
[6:20:05] amgine04: very fincher
[6:21:55] Somanie: @Xetane if you try to become a crafter though that shit is tedious
