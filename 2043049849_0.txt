[0:16:15] Jeff_dd: visual appearance
[0:16:37] doomwh1sp3r: Hey Sir! How's it going? Loved the Echo Chamber yesterday
[0:17:22] ZeffLeppard: That makes perfect sense actually, like it looks real good outside of combat
[0:17:27] Jeff_dd: i get that but on the other hannd they teach you that at college/design courses
[0:17:31] mohaso21: more to come in future no worries
[0:17:34] ZeffLeppard: But the blue was just so much easier
[0:17:48] doomwh1sp3r: As a ~WR500-700 raider who tries his best to avoid M+, loved the comparison segment LUL
[0:18:24] Jeff_dd: yeah they are self made
[0:18:32] Jeff_dd: if you have good portfolio
[0:18:34] Jeff_dd: thats ennough
[0:19:35] ZeffLeppard: How is baby scripe doing?
[0:19:37] Hozzar1: pvp probably
[0:19:45] doomwh1sp3r: Yeah, I'd guess PvP
[0:19:56] Jeff_dd: i had to make a rebrand of a visual identity for a nonnprofit that helps ppl with disabilities with dogs
[0:20:01] doomwh1sp3r: but last PvP I did was Rank 2 in vanilla LUL
[0:20:04] Jeff_dd: u see there that it cannt all be just pretty
[0:20:09] Pava_TV: depends how are u build and what you enjoy grinding / playing
[0:20:09] Jeff_dd: have to follow some guidelines aetc
[0:20:10] Hozzar1: pvp just because you're competitng against others
[0:20:11] mohaso21: high end m+ content is harder
[0:20:37] Hozzar1: m+ and raiding purely because you're interacting with npcs
[0:20:43] doomwh1sp3r: PvP is the most reaction-based/unscripted I guess.
[0:20:51] nash25pl: scripe the big brain man is here  Howdy !
[0:21:35] Hozzar1: pvp
[0:21:44] frelyah: if anything relying less on addons just makes pvpers better their awareness is insane
[0:21:45] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[0:21:48] katazh1: @mohaso21  You have alot of rank1 pvp players in the rank1 mythic + pool, not ther other way around. I think pvp is harder at the top.
[0:21:54] mohaso21: probably pvp
[0:22:35] JukeboxHey: PVP
[0:22:47] Dritlukt: not saying its easy, but i think pvp is easier simply because there is less competition
[0:22:48] assrug: world first raiding imo
[0:22:50] doomwh1sp3r: Raiding is really rank dependent. World First you gotta squeeze both skill and sync 20+ people
[0:23:00] JukeboxHey: PVP due to it is so stale, no new players are welcomed
[0:23:12] JukeboxHey: It is players who have played since tbc
[0:23:13] mohaso21: it all depends tho if you have a bad team or roster for raiding then raiding is the hardest to achieve
[0:23:17] qisen1: wdyt about this patch so far
[0:23:23] JukeboxHey: Who win
[0:23:27] bug_legacy: pve requires a lot more work to get be competitive with the Echo's of the world
[0:23:32] assrug: it's probably pvp because people are still stubborn about using addons / not using addons
[0:23:48] assrug: think there is more room for invention in pvp
[0:23:50] Dritlukt: also the barrier for entry isnt as big for pvp
[0:23:51] Dritlukt: imo
[0:24:04] doomwh1sp3r: The lower ranked Raiding difficulty comes from keeping the 10 better people happy, while the others catch up
[0:24:06] katazh1: @Dritlukt  Less competition should make it harder yeah? the less people who queue pvp, the lower the rating gap will be. i might be wrong.
[0:24:07] mohaso21: you got enough changes you dont need more KEKW
[0:24:15] Dritlukt: @katazh1 nah
[0:24:34] assrug: the competetive pvp scene is incredibly small
[0:24:41] Dritlukt: less competition makes it easier as u dont have as many ppl that are pushing eachother to become better
[0:24:54] Lilithay: @sarug agree whaazz,raiku,chan, lontar GG
[0:25:05] katazh1: @Dritlukt  Thats wrong, with a lower rating gap, you will queue in to rank1s at low rating trust.
[0:25:14] Dritlukt: yes u will queue into rank 1 agreed
[0:25:17] Dritlukt: but that is not the point
[0:25:34] Dritlukt: the point is, the more good players u have, the more competition u have, which means the desire to win becomes higher
[0:25:55] Dritlukt: being rank 1 out of 100 ppl is nearly as impressive as being rank 1 out of 10000 ppl
[0:25:57] Dritlukt: sort of thing
[0:26:00] Dritlukt: isnt*
[0:26:09] katazh1: @Dritlukt  in m+ you are not locked to mmr, so i mean rating is a big factor here
[0:26:24] Dritlukt: thought we were talking raiding vs pvp here
[0:26:32] Dritlukt: rating for sure is a big factor
[0:26:44] Dritlukt: but say both start from fresh
[0:26:52] Dritlukt: id say pvp is easier to get rank 1 than raiding
[0:26:56] mohaso21: yeah you do
[0:27:07] Dritlukt: just my opinion ofc
[0:27:09] assrug: whaazz is honestly the craziest player i've ever seen, playing at 300 apm, communicating what is going to happen and what needs to happen every global
[0:27:19] assrug: it's completely crazy to watch imo
[0:27:24] Pava_TV: @Dritlukt yes, becouse you have whole season, but for raiding you have 1 week full of grind
[0:27:33] mohaso21: ret pala got massive buffs
[0:27:44] qisen1: do you think outlaw can be on mdi stage?
[0:27:45] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[0:27:46] katazh1: @Dritlukt  i guess we see it different, im not top player at all. But my glad achivment was alot harder then all pve content i have done personally. But never been close to r1 on either.
[0:29:11] assrug: Dritlukt getting r1 is much much harder than raiding in a 0.1% guild (what r1 means)
[0:30:23] mohaso21: KEKW
[0:30:25] mohaso21: thats why
[0:30:45] doomwh1sp3r: Think Survival is good, cuz their AoE spec doesn't sacrifice much ST and their ST, doesn't sacrifice much survival
[0:30:58] doomwh1sp3r: much AoE*
[0:31:40] doomwh1sp3r: Well you wouldn't play Survival if you have BM in it's current state to begin with
[0:31:49] akotirous: @Scripe try swapping from Damage to 'Damage to bosses'
[0:32:31] assrug: getting r1 is not compareable to winning rwf if anything you need to compare it to winning blizzcon / awc
[0:32:44] doomwh1sp3r: Yeah, syncing 20+ people is a whole other world
[0:33:19] doomwh1sp3r: Think Survival parses are mostly due to casuals sticking to it and Mains playing the more optimal specs
[0:33:31] doomwh1sp3r: BM just chill
[0:33:46] yenny__: ret is disgusting on ST now
[0:33:52] yenny__: they sim like almost 270K pure ST
[0:33:55] yenny__: now
[0:34:03] doomwh1sp3r: Yeah, we demand Ret nerfs
[0:34:04] Spiritakk: also in high end raiding there is so much to it, managing 20+ people, strats, WAs, prep, m+, assignments, huge group effort of a small to mid size company basically for weeks / months.
[0:34:25] assrug: ret might actually be meta specc for m+ now because sac and bop are very useful (kind of the reason why prot pal is competetive)
[0:34:49] doomwh1sp3r: Is this pre-buff or post-buff tho
[0:35:08] frelyah: warrior being ignored as per usual blizzard are unironicly clowns who have no clue what they are doing
[0:35:28] Spiritakk: also the fact that 1 person in mythic raid steps 1yd wrong or does a bad global and u insta wipe, so you need 20 people play perfectly and each and one of them can kill everyone :D
[0:35:53] mohaso21: it is
[0:35:59] yenny__: ret with lego peaks at like 270K ST on a 5 minute sim monkaW
[0:36:09] mohaso21: verdict is ST and divine storm is aoe
[0:36:16] assrug: don't forget that ret is also basically immortal and bop and sac are really good in high m+
[0:36:25] assrug: ret probably a vibe in m+ now
[0:36:33] yenny__: going aoe is like a 20% loss on ST
[0:36:43] yenny__: but aoe is also disgusting if you spec into it
[0:36:49] doomwh1sp3r: That's post-buff Scripe
[0:36:54] mohaso21: Dk lover
[0:36:56] doomwh1sp3r: the log was from today
[0:37:08] doomwh1sp3r: Yeah, they still need nerfs LUL
[0:37:09] Jeff_dd: for mdi?
[0:37:09] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[0:37:13] Popodk: what happnd with noggie? just heard he is joining method?
[0:37:13] doomwh1sp3r: they've had their weekl
[0:37:14] Jeff_dd: survival isnt really ann issue nno?
[0:37:25] assrug: i mean the rogue got a 100% as well
[0:37:30] assrug: and he would still trash him
[0:37:50] Lilithay: @Popodk business :) same lorgok ? :D
[0:38:15] doomwh1sp3r: absolute scrub ret, not even 150m LUL /s
[0:38:42] assrug: oh i thought you were still looking at the other log where the ret would have done 5 mil more
[0:38:52] Popodk: @Lilithay hmmm quess ur right =)
[0:38:56] mohaso21: you will always be a dk lover
[0:39:04] frelyah: @Popodk prob dont like being perma benched
[0:39:18] Eliannoula: no need to speculate :D
[0:39:20] Popodk: @frelyah XD
[0:39:23] Denekyy: are blood dks good in raid ?
[0:39:44] doomwh1sp3r: Blood DKs straight up solo tank stuff like Tindral
[0:39:53] Lilithay: @Eliannoula my point, whatever it is, everyone have their onw plan :) some go, some stay some leaves.. so :)
[0:40:09] mohaso21: seething flame is a passive Scripe
[0:40:15] Lilithay: @doomwh1sp3r had yesterday a 450 blood dk he tanked solo hc :D
[0:40:20] Lilithay: @Lilithay fyrak
[0:40:25] assrug: noggie and lorgok are completely different players
[0:40:35] assrug: in terms of mindset and what they would bring to a team
[0:40:36] karlzen95: Both are talents
[0:40:49] Lilithay: @sarug true, and each of them have their reasons , so all is good :D
[0:41:17] mohaso21: you played blood dk and prot pala
[0:41:19] Lilithay: Meeresteel
[0:41:26] doomwh1sp3r: Our BDK Solo tanks Tindral, offtank just runs to shrooms
[0:41:31] doomwh1sp3r: and throws freedoms LUL
[0:41:46] assrug: dk also pumps no

[0:49:31] JukeboxHey: Haha Surrender was crack cocain
[0:50:06] mohaso21: yeah
[0:50:23] mohaso21: they reduced  how often he charges like that tho
[0:51:04] mohaso21: you can still get it iam pretty sure
[0:51:04] omgimsougly: by the time the cast goes off and he leaps you can cs again
[0:51:08] d4_damager_: youll have time tho because it has to drag
[0:51:21] Jeff_dd: should a melee always kick that? sinnce u have to go innside the sand thinng
[0:51:29] mohaso21: there is the cast timer and all that so you should have time to get them all
[0:52:03] Jeff_dd: ah fair, i just dash as havoc
[0:52:04] mohaso21: i do believe you can always get that as a mage
[0:52:04] Jeff_dd: :D
[0:52:33] blue321: If u kick it as a mage with the talent then mage kick is 20sec, right?
[0:52:41] mohaso21: its not triggered on success
[0:53:11] Jeff_dd: soon at raikus lvl Sure
[0:53:25] mohaso21: no i will always assign you to it KEKW
[0:53:56] Jeff_dd: thats huge

[0:56:50] mohaso21: the tank buster got nerfed like crazy
[0:57:14] mohaso21: this is the 2nd big nerf to the tank buster so fart
[0:58:02] mohaso21: Temporal breath
[0:58:22] mohaso21: wasn't me
[0:58:27] mohaso21: i never flopped to it
[0:59:03] mohaso21: play it so you can rank it too
[0:59:08] itsbrysontv: just hype or will it stay around?
[0:59:20] foggyfr: It's on game pass its alright
[0:59:40] mohaso21: its free on xbox game pass if u have it
[0:59:51] Eliannoula: i did play palworld for 2h and refunded
[0:59:58] Eliannoula: it didn't hook me
[1:00:13] mohaso21: @Eliannoula damn
[1:00:13] beastywf: this game is pretty decent, I've played for like 25 hours overall
[1:00:21] beastywf: if you like valheim - it might be similar
[1:00:28] mohaso21: Enlighten us Elia
[1:00:36] Eliannoula: no it was actually just 'get your base to lvl 7 and confront x guy'
[1:00:42] Eliannoula: so catch pokemon and upgrade base
[1:00:46] beastywf: it is survival game
[1:00:48] beastywf: yes
[1:00:50] Eliannoula: but it was weird imo
[1:00:59] Eliannoula: thats all you do in the beginning
[1:01:14] Eliannoula: and then day/night cycle + running around and getting resources
[1:01:27] Eliannoula: and i played on normal difficulty with no extra stuff
[1:01:30] mohaso21: on stream = content
[1:01:49] beastywf: yeah, AI in this game could've been better
[1:02:11] yenny__: reacting DIESOFCRINGE
[1:02:50] MrXanderOG: put it on 2x
[1:03:09] chadderz7: Bedge
[1:04:24] beastywf: why can't people just play this game instead of arguing endlessly KEKW
[1:05:22] Slayy0404: @beastywf becoz it’s a bad game
[1:05:31] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[1:05:40] d4_damager_: its basically plagiarism, the AI 'stealing' the artists work
[1:05:58] beastywf: @Slayy0404 it's not that deep man
[1:06:01] MrAndersen_: artists are worried that companies will use ai art for everything so they wont have a job
[1:06:16] Slayy0404: @beastywf that’s why I never played KEKW
[1:06:17] lol_iris: The main problem with it afaik is that the models have been trained on copyrighted content and no royalties have been paid
[1:06:19] Eliannoula: nintendo tried suing the devs of temtem, a game that is closer to pokemon than palworld and they lost cause its different enough. nintento doesn't have a leg to stand on imo
[1:06:29] MrAndersen_: instead of learning to use it themselves to make more art themselves
[1:06:30] foggyfr: Improvise, adapt, overcome, gigachad
[1:06:36] lol_iris: And now the AI can just copy the artist style and continue to produce content in that same style without royalties
[1:06:43] lol_iris: That's the main legal problem
[1:06:50] lol_iris: The rest is more philosophical
[1:07:55] Slayy0404: @eliannoula The only reason it’s sued just becoz it’s a same JP company Nintendo wouldn’t do shit if it’s a foreign game
[1:07:57] MrXanderOG: If it would have been too similar nintendo would have filed a lawsuit already. But i think it's hard for them. Maybe they are cooking tho
[1:08:01] Kemskemss: there’s a fine line between being inspired and plagiarism
[1:08:16] lofvet: But if you for example ask the AI to make a painting, looking like it was made by Da Vinci. The product it produce will be based on alot of Da Vinci's work for example
[1:08:20] Micwini: The maker of the statement seems to be an artist themselves, so its very much a biased statement. Be aware
[1:08:24] foggyfr: Yeah wtf ?
[1:08:26] lol_iris: The estimation for copyright law violations by OpenAI was something like a couple of trillion dollars\
[1:08:33] lol_iris: So it's not like a trivial offense
[1:08:56] foggyfr: AI just goes on its own and mass produces all the art pepehands, no one is accountable
[1:08:57] lofvet: A human would be influenced, the AI will acyually use the work
[1:09:07] 4stronauth: bcs people are actually dumb
[1:09:32] Slayy0404: @4stronauth that applies to both sides
[1:09:45] Kemskemss: part of the issue may be that you can sue another author who stole your work or smth. But law status of AI is still not determined. So it’s kinda unpunishable?
[1:09:45] MrAndersen_: yea he is making a descriptive statement and they are interpreting it as a prespription i think
[1:10:06] SaintRas: There's a difference between inspiration and plagiarism
[1:10:26] lol_iris: @Kemskemss this is also a factor, yeah. Legislation around AI produced content is still non-existant
[1:11:17] Micwini: Plagiarism would be copypasting the exact same artwork and posing it as your own work. I don't think that is what this is about?
[1:11:32] Kemskemss: There are lawsuits against OpenAI for example, but u can’t say they’re solved towards the authors without issues. It’s still a shaky ground
[1:11:37] MrAndersen_: I mean he is saying its factual that artists opinions dont matter to companys, not whether they ought to
[1:11:39] SaintRas: Nah parts can be plagiarized
[1:11:45] jumbobananasplit: the biggest problem is our politicians are all boomers who can't even handle their smartphones, let alone navigate a discussion about AI OMEGALUL
[1:12:09] foggyfr: Transformative. Is a word I hear often with things like this XD
[1:12:28] rei__03: it's different, many new ststems
[1:12:35] Slayy0404: HUH
[1:13:04] Micwini: @jumbobananasplit I think this is the biggest problem of our time. This is the first time in history where old people are the ones with the least knowledge. Before widespread internet and computers, old people were always a great source of knowledge. No more is this the case.

[1:13:35] Teraision: i mean pokemon are based on animals, pals are too so of course there are some similarities
[1:13:36] Honvar: I hate  that it looks like Digimon Kappa
[1:13:59] foggyfr: if AI is doing anything it's cause a human has made it do it
[1:14:03] 4stronauth: yeah, IA just do it quickly for you
[1:14:06] limeyo_: does the pal game have good reviews
[1:14:11] jumbobananasplit: nintendo is usually extremely strict when enforcing their copyright, if they haven't sued yet then they are probably distinct enough
[1:14:20] Slayy0404: @teraision bruh what kind of animals look like that irl ICANT
[1:14:34] TomaHawK_The_One: true nitendo dont joke around copyright
[1:14:46] Eliannoula: nintendo tried suing the devs of temtem but they lost
[1:14:55] SaintRas: They might be gahering some facts before they file suit
[1:14:58] SaintRas: gathering
[1:15:09] MrAndersen_: yea will it sure as hell is on the radar now
[1:15:16] Teraision: @Slayy0404 it's based on a deer i guess
[1:15:28] foggyfr: yeah idk why anyone is talking about AI
[1:15:32] rei__03: and just like asmon says, what if they are similar? pal world is straight up is a fun game, and that is the only thing most people care about
[1:16:02] SaintRas: To me, this is plagiarism. I could look at some of the pictures and think the Palworld character is the pokemon it's copying
[1:16:18] TomaHawK_The_One: this Ai question going to have to be addressed one day , at the end of the day its all about money , just pay artist you train your IA on , thats it
[1:16:20] daevyfan: driving to the kitchen and back
[1:16:21] Slayy0404: @rei__03 lol most them buying becoz they just following the trend
[1:16:52] lol_iris: They did
[1:17:06] lol_iris: The game was made to grow as much as possible as fast as possible
[1:17:15] Micwini: I thought this was an official pokemon game LULW
[1:17:16] zoko177: heard something that the devs of Palworld went AFK, is that true ?
[1:17:17] lol_iris: So they probably banked on the idea that they will get away with it
[1:17:18] WegPiraat404: The game probably won't get sued per wikipedia: "The game was revealed on June 5, 2021, detailing key features such as survival, crafting, exploration, exploitation of creatures, and the multiplayer focus."  Nintendo had plenty of time to sue but didn't so why would they do it now?
[1:17:20] lol_iris: Yes
[1:17:24] foggyfr: This game didn't advertise at all either which is kind of interesting. Already looking like a pokemon game felt no need too. Could be suss idk
[1:17:40] rei__03: @Slayy0404 then it's working, very positive reviews so far
[1:17:57] TomaHawK_The_One: they just came out with a roadmap for the game , the game is not going away any time soon
[1:18:00] Teraision: @WegPiraat404 They just announced they will investigate
[1:18:04] Ysida: cant wait when blizzard will be sued for pets battle
[1:18:08] Slayy0404: @rei__03 positive HUH which world dude is living in ICANT
[1:18:19] Eliannoula: but its also regarding the people taking about the AI things, i have not heard any before its success
[1:18:30] Eliannoula: noone complained about AI use before
[1:18:53] SaintRas: They will prrobably have to change the pals that are too similar yeah
[1:18:56] foggyfr: I mean would a massive company go for every single person doing anything with there shit? like if you have insignificant things copying you. Why would you care? Yes its probably all about money, but is that so unreasonable
[1:18:57] rei__03: also keep in mind that there is no fair use policy in japan, and both companies are located there
[1:19:05] rei__03: @Slayy0404 on steam lmao
[1:19:07] Micwini: Maybe the white/blue deer is not the best example, but apart from it being a deer and blue/white I don't see any similarities
[1:19:23] SaintRas: I think you have to enforce your copyright or you lose it?
[1:20:12] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[1:20:34] lol_iris: Where even is the jurisdiction of this case
[1:20:41] lol_iris: Japan or wherever palworld is registered?
[1:20:52] lol_iris: Cuz if it's Japan they are 6ft under already
[1:20:58] Ysida: AI always using existing assets and redfine them with other
[1:21:00] foggyfr: basically same shape as well I mean
[1:21:17] KianWLK: horns too similar
[1:21:17] rei__03: @lol_iris how so?
[1:21:35] foggyfr: true
[1:21:40] lol_iris: Nintendo doesn't fuck around and the Japanese courts side with them
[1:21:46] lol_iris: cuz of nationalism and everything
[1:22:01] MrAndersen_: yea they are both jp
[1:22:01] rei__03: both companies are from japan
[1:22:02] lol_iris: See my prev msg
[1:22:13] 2twofaced: pokemon fanatic crying
[1:22:25] lol_iris: they cooked themselves
[1:22:25] phausen: its similar enough where palworld got free advertising though right?
[1:22:41] Ysida: the drama is free #ads
[1:23:01] Micwini: If the owner of pokemon sees no problem with it, then what is the problem exactly
[1:23:03] rei__03: i still believe if nintendo would have done something they would already done it by now
[1:23:24] 2twofaced: just pokemon fanatic BabyRage
[1:23:36] lol_iris: Yeah, they are using AI as cover for it because it's still grey area and has no solid precedence set in lawsuits
[1:23:39] Mister_Earth: They copied sheep from pokemon I am filled with rage
[1:23:40] foggyfr: Palwords is made by a company called Pocketpair, which is based in Tokyo, japan lmao
[1:23:42] 2twofaced: nintendo should make a community workshop decades ago
[1:23:48] lol_iris: It's more than obv that it's intentionally made to look like pokemon
[1:24:46] SaintRas: Of course Asmon doesn't see an issue, he makes his living as a react streamer
[1:24:59] Ysida: asmongold fcked up, he shouldnt say anything regarding to artist xd
[1:25:25] SaintRas: It's a grey area
[1:25:31] Micwini: People often misinterpret Asmon's statement of facts as his opinions
[1:25:48] SaintRas: Nobody knows how much "reaction" is enough to count as a transformation
[1:26:20] Ysida: artist have the power, just look at one "Austrian Artist"
[1:26:44] Micwini: @Ysida He was actually a failed art student LULW so maybe the opposite is true
[1:26:50] foggyfr: This is dumb "I did a bad thing but its just this thing. who cares"  Not a great argument
[1:27:22] jumbobananasplit: for the consumer the opinion of the creator doesn't matter, just look at funko pops. From an artistic standpoint they are ugly as hell, but they are still a million dollar industry
[1:28:43] Ysida: there is problem because AI don't create from thin air
[1:28:43] lol_iris: There is a difference on what the model of AI has been trained on
[1:28:44] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[1:28:47] foggyfr: Problem for artists, no issue for consumers I think
[1:29:27] lol_iris: But you are discussing AI vs procedural
[1:29:31] lol_iris: Where is the human?
[1:29:36] rei__03: everything is a derivation of something, you can hardly make something 100% original
[1:29:57] Kingcoconutcrab: The training algorithms are created by a human
[1:30:03] Micwini: @Ysida AI indeed doesnt create art from thin air. You are fully correct. But neither do real artists.
[1:30:04] lol_iris: It follows a sort of formula for generating content (this formula is made by a human)
[1:30:04] foggyfr: You could train AI to make original art or? If can make AI copy shit you can make it "copy" your original work
[1:30:05] Outlawking_Gaming: Someone created the AI it didnt create itself
[1:30:17] lol_iris: The AI uses training data to come up with this formula
[1:30:49] Ysida: @Micwini that is not true, if that would be case that would mean there will be 0 uniqueness" across everything
[1:31:02] rei__03: google it my man
[1:31:36] pricebanana: NOTED
[1:31:41] Ysida: the difference is that AI takes inispiration only by human works
[1:31:41] WegPiraat404: about to be canceled like asmon monkaSHAKE
[1:31:51] Micwini: @Ysida Artists make their art based on things they have seen or experience IRL. In that aspect it is no different than AI. Take pokemons themselves: Most of them are based on preexisting animals.
[1:31:52] lol_iris: Yes
[1:31:56] Kingcoconutcrab: yes
[1:32:03] Ysida: @Micwini Yeah, like cthulu for example
[1:32:13] lol_iris: The problem is the accountability for IP violation
[1:32:23] lol_iris: The way to get to the product is not really relevant
[1:32:27] lol_iris: As you said
[1:32:41] Kingcoconutcrab: I missed some of this stream, but I assume this is about Palworld or?
[1:32:50] lol_iris: @Kingcoconutcrab yep
[1:33:00] Ysida: it will be a major difference if the AI would have more input data like human do. not only data from other humans that filled it
[1:33:03] Kingcoconutcrab: Oke, well Takuro Mizobe has a dodgy history yeah, try and look into him
[1:33:09] Micwini: @Ysida There is no art that is fully unique. It always has its inspiration from the real world. AI does the same, ableit in this case with a more limited source to draw inspiration from. But the process is the exact same
[1:33:13] Kingcoconutcrab: (ceo of Palworld)
[1:33:26] WegPiraat404: Bro cancel culture is so dumb lmao
[1:33:36] Kingcoconutcrab: Takuro Mizobe has been apparently been in similar plagiarism cases
[1:33:40] ZeffLeppard: Dont pretend we all copied homework, got good marks and now care about it suddenly XD
[1:33:50] Kingcoconutcrab: so it's not his first rodeo
[1:34:05] injos: I feel the best way to look at AI art is as if it's a evolution of photoshop filters. The tool evolved and can now do more complex tasks, but you still need to tell it what to do.
[1:34:06] rei__03: @Micwini don't google giant squid KEKW
[1:34:09] lol_iris: You can't do that cuz of how IP laws work and protect nieches of the market
[1:34:24] Kingcoconutcrab: Same, literally immediately asked if this was a new pokemon game
[1:34:27] lol_iris: It's like the thing with the recently lifted Micky Mouse
[1:34:39] AfektGGBG: AI is just a tool
[1:34:51] pricebanana: let lawyers to deal with id YEP
[1:34:53] WegPiraat404: they are lmao
[1:35:02] Ysida: @Micwini for example if there would a artist that is raised in wild and only draw by himself around himself it would be unique because he didnt copied other works
[1:35:05] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[1:35:08] foggyfr: Succeeding off that back of another companies influence and development of there art kinda. Money is big issue
[1:35:24] lol_iris: But what do you mean what the discussion is about? It's drama farming. It all comes down to artists, AI companies and lawyers coming up with laws
[1:35:25] Ysida: taking inspiration and copy works is not the same
[1:35:39] Kemskemss: your argument is surprisingly similar to ‘wow players using WA to play for them’ discussion :D
[1:35:54] injos: I think the discussion is about companies are afraid to no longer earn money from copyright material. I mean why pay for old work when new work can be done cheaper.
[1:36:03] Micwini: @Scripe I dont think it is good that you don't know what the actual discussion is about. Just creates frustration. If we're talking about AI in general, yes there should be more/better laws. If we are talking about this case specifically: Yes they look very similar and obviously it took inspiration from pokemon. But if Nintendo has no issue with them being copied, im not sure what the issue is.
[1:36:06] Kingcoconutcrab: we shouldn't just shy away from AI just because the repercussions long-term are unknown or "scary", that's something that keeps back progress and human (modern) evolution
[1:36:18] lol_iris: None of our opinions matter but it's free engagement for content creators, so there is crazy incentive to just yap about it no matter your opinion
[1:36:47] Micwini: @Ysida I mean he copied how the real world looked. So he used existing shapes and forms to make his own art. AI does the same.
[1:37:06] itsbrysontv: do your own research
[1:37:08] mohaso21: KEKW
[1:37:27] foggyfr: Soz I am a scripe drone, I've been copying all your spicy takes
[1:37:34] lol_iris: D: mr strimmer is not always correct
[1:37:40] Eliannoula: the ghuls at it again :D
[1:37:42] lol_iris: not you specifically @Scripe
[1:37:52] lol_iris: just a comment on why there is so much fuss about it
[1:38:08] lol_iris: AI is hot news, Pokemon is huge, Palworld is huge
[1:38:40] AfektGGBG: the laws are old as f by the time they update will be too late Shruge
[1:38:50] Ysida: @Micwini taking inspiration and copy works is not the same taking Inspiration of someone Inspiration is the case.
[1:38:54] Kingcoconutcrab: I love AI :O
[1:39:07] lol_iris: Scripe farming good karma with the AI overlords
[1:39:10] lol_iris: smh
[1:39:16] paosdaloa: Yeah, make ai even greater, i got to get my degree
[1:39:18] Kemskemss: president of what?
[1:39:18] lol_iris: Wants to RL the AI revolution
[1:39:19] injos: Tyrell company inc
[1:39:27] itsbrysontv: AI BABIES 💀
[1:39:47] Micwini: @Ysida If you can try again in proper english, then I'd like to continue the discussion. It looks similar, but it is not a copypaste.
[1:39:54] Honvar: AI raid leading!
[1:41:02] ggorbaz: Just Give the Humans AI when AI It self dont let humans Abuse it
[1:41:32] Kingcoconutcrab: He's kind of escalating his own argument
[1:41:35] 2twofaced: twitter echo chamber
[1:41:49] AfektGGBG: @aloneinmyhead twitch is the same tbh
[1:41:58] foggyfr: tbh posting a youtube vid about how you got cancelled is kinda ironic.
[1:42:05] 2twofaced: @AfektGGBG ofc
[1:42:25] rei__03: that is exactly what happens
[1:43:01] Lzone01: yo scipe . do you have the replay of the last day video with the echo member last day about mdi ?
[1:43:03] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[1:43:06] Kingcoconutcrab: this is a philosophical discussion that's been around for years
[1:43:50] Kemskemss: @Lzone01 there’s a VOD avaliable on Echo channel
[1:44:16] lol_iris: @Scripe how many MDI teams are Echo players gonna run and do you have an official one (first time following M+ events)
[1:44:28] Ysida: @Micwini i am sorry english is not my main lang. I just wanted to say uniqueness exist for the reason.
[1:44:47] rei__03: coltan mines xD
[1:45:00] Kemskemss: @lol_iris Echo runs one. Called, well, Echo =) but a lot of players play in different teams
[1:45:37] lol_iris: does Scripe coach/play in the official one?
[1:45:43] Kingcoconutcrab: same discussion can be had about sugar currently
[1:46:01] Kingcoconutcrab: Hyperprocessed
[1:46:04] Micwini: @Ysida Np, neither is mine. I just didnt understand that sentence. The point Im trying to make is that there is 0 difference in how a human or an AI makes art. They both take inspiration from existing sources. Obviously in this case, the inspiration from the AI is very limited, which is why it looks similar.
[1:46:17] s_t_o_r_m__: sweeteners are worse then sugar lol
[1:46:27] Kingcoconutcrab: funded by sugar companies
[1:46:29] Kingcoconutcrab: :)
[1:46:45] rei__03: yeah companies are lobbying those studies
[1:47:04] Kemskemss: @lol_iris no. It’s Meeres, Gingi, Clickz, Zaelia, Naowh
[1:47:09] Kingcoconutcrab: nope, but the general consumer doesn't do research about the source of the information
[1:47:18] s_t_o_r_m__: depends how much sugar
[1:47:49] Kingcoconutcrab: no, sugar is pretty bad, depends on the form though and what's provided with (fibers)
[1:49:08] AfektGGBG: Sadge reality
[1:49:23] Ysida: @Micwini The difference is the input data. The AI can only take inspiration from the pre existed other sources. Where humans have more information like their life expierience,feelings and the view that somebody couldnt never seen.
[1:49:23] injos: @Kingcoconutcrab No sugar is not bad. Sugar in to big quantity is bad.
[1:49:36] s_t_o_r_m__: air is also bad depending where you live ^^
[1:49:57] Kingcoconutcrab: I mean, I do fault Asmongold for making a lot of assumptions in his arguments and then ending his own argument with "of course", this is not a healthy way of discussing this topic (regardless of the topic),
[1:50:16] foggyfr: what is this preaching haha
[1:50:16] itsbrysontv: KEKW
[1:50:18] AfektGGBG: KEKL
[1:50:25] Ysida: @Ysida if you are doomer and sad and you lose ur family and you have to draw outside world what the picture will look like?
[1:50:30] Kemskemss: @Kingcoconutcrab and ‘you see what I’m saying???’’ xD
[1:50:55] Kingcoconutcrab: @injos I see, well I disagree with you, but you can look up your own information and make up your own mind :P
[1:50:57] speels414: lol
[1:51:04] paosdaloa: he will be president one day
[1:51:10] paosdaloa: knowing americans
[1:51:14] Micwini: @Ysida Life experiences, feelings, emotions are also pre existing other sources of information
[1:51:27] Kemskemss: @paosdaloa can’t be worse than now, right?
[1:51:31] Kingcoconutcrab: @Kemskemss Yeah, I never really like Asmongold I feel like he's a lowkey narcissist
[1:51:31] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[1:51:39] rei__03: @Kingcoconutcrab literally first google search "Glucose is the essential metabolic fuel for the brain"
[1:51:42] Tayyun: world of warcraft gaming room in the oval office LuL
[1:51:42] fetza108: content philosopher in these days. he is gigachad style
[1:51:57] Kingcoconutcrab: @rei__03 as I said, "the form" :p
[1:52:07] Micwini: @Ysida Especially newer AI can already make good art with just some vague words and emotions as its prompts
[1:52:13] mohaso21: OMEGALUL
[1:52:32] foggyfr: what if I don't value holding things in place... Gigachad
[1:52:36] Kemskemss: @Kingcoconutcrab I kinda like him, cause he allows me to be in a circle of news and sometimes he’s very geniune. But he is supposed to be taken with a grain of salt not as a opinion model for sure
[1:52:41] Hozzar1: Getting world first holds no value NOTED
[1:52:44] AfektGGBG: Smadging too late
[1:52:48] injos: @Kingcoconutcrab You can disagree all you want, but it's not my opinion. It's fact. Sugar is not dangerous or hurtful. The dose makes the posion.
[1:52:52] Kingcoconutcrab: @Kemskemss to each their own ;D
[1:52:56] ExtraCode: It has subjective value. It can inspire but not actually do something
[1:53:12] Ysida: @Micwini it isnt about "draw the human with happy face" its about how the emotions are added to the picture.
[1:53:26] Kemskemss: @Kingcoconutcrab of course, as long as people are civil about it =)
[1:53:31] Kingcoconutcrab: @injos Yeah, I'm not going into a chat discussion with someone from chat yeah ^^
[1:53:41] foggyfr: what even is his point, that if something isn't massively valued its worthless ? This isn't true
[1:53:47] paosdaloa: Uhhhh
[1:53:49] AfektGGBG: Aware
[1:53:55] Micwini: @Ysida AI can already do that. I know its scary, but functionally there is no difference in the process in how the art is created
[1:54:10] paosdaloa: I think thats where he went wrong, value isnt something we all agree on
[1:54:17] Micwini: @Ysida Source of information -> produce painting/picture
[1:54:18] tyssr: i forgot what the point is xD
[1:54:19] paosdaloa: Something for me can have waay more value than for you
[1:54:32] itsbrysontv: @tyssr I was just going to say, what are  we talking about here
[1:54:41] Ysida: @Micwini While AI can mimic certain aspects of human creativity and generate impressive outputs, it currently lacks the depth and authenticity that come from the complex interplay of emotions, experiences, and consciousness that define the human creative process.
[1:54:41] benchae: idk either but it makes sense
[1:55:08] Eliannoula: art people xD
[1:55:31] Micwini: @Ysida So you areimplying that you can differentiate AI art from human made art 100% of the time?
[1:55:32] daevyfan: artists
[1:55:59] rei__03: that is a lot of bs KEKW
[1:56:08] mrz_as: AINTNOWAY
[1:56:26] daevyfan: but do consumers care to pay for that of that
[1:56:29] Kingcoconutcrab: @Ysida I googled ur comment, lul
[1:57:14] s_t_o_r_m__: AI more like a puzzler stitching things together that other  people created
[1:57:24] AfektGGBG: AI is just a tool LUL to make a game faster, in the end it will still need “operator”
[1:57:25] foggyfr: This perspective of "value is defined by a consumer" Has truth, but its more of a back and forth. Just because its worth something today, doesn't mean it will tomorrow. Artists and ppl manufacturing shit can wait for an offer they like
[1:57:56] Kingcoconutcrab: AI is just a tool to optimize my Retri paladin rotation
[1:57:56] Kemskemss: emotions matter but they’re not needed everywhere. Tho I’m not sure if it’s still can be called art and not just, I dunno, pictures
[1:58:10] Ysida: @Micwini right now? yes. it will be a different in the future when the AI will behave at the same level as humans.
[1:58:12] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe

[2:00:15] foggyfr: going back and crying evil aint it yeah
[2:01:13] Kingcoconutcrab: then it's up to you to get that on paper as well and be made part of record at work
[2:01:17] Kingcoconutcrab: (in some countries :p )
[2:01:27] Kemskemss: imagine Scripe promising Dota he’s gonna play next tier as a Shadow Sadge
[2:01:37] WegPiraat404: ikr haha
[2:01:48] WegPiraat404: they just dont like what is being said
[2:02:05] Ysida: people don't care about the product where it came from. you can create the best product ever and it came from China for example and people will be afraid of security issues
[2:02:17] Micwini: Artists are artist for a reason. They flock to emotions and interpretation, because they lack the intellect to deal with facts and reality.
[2:02:32] JukeboxHey: @Micwini ?
[2:02:57] Kemskemss: @Micwini take as hot as a volcano O.o

[2:03:46] aavegotchi1221: We need Asmongold to come to Turkiye become new president
[2:03:49] berylia_berret: Thats a bit much KEKL
[2:03:52] s_t_o_r_m__: @Eliannoula LUL
[2:04:00] Ihgfdh: @MoonKyun thats called progress
[2:04:01] berylia_berret: theres a bit of truth in that but at the same time, the world is grey and depressing without "art"
[2:04:04] Ysida: the take "people dont care about process only about end product" is false. even last russia vs ukraine war showcase people wont buy some products even if the product is top notch
[2:04:17] MoonKyun: Yeah but is it wrong for them to feel that way initially ? LOL
[2:04:19] FatherSalvi: companies unethically hire kid sweatshops and do shady stuff to lessen production costs but ppl ignore it bc of how good the product is -- same with art even if it steps on artists. If it's cheaper and fulfills the purpose it always gets bought
[2:04:41] Actuelle_: AI can even copy your own style , its already dedge
[2:04:52] aavegotchi1221: will you replace GINGI by AI?
[2:04:53] MoonKyun: I'm just saying that's what I think their feelings are I am neutral on this convo LOL
[2:04:55] Kingcoconutcrab: Art is a niche, some consumers love it, some don't, to each their own. Some think art has to be done by a person, otherwise it likes a human's touch, others don't care and wouldn't mind having AI.  There is not right or wrong answer here, personally
[2:05:08] Kingcoconutcrab: likes=lacks
[2:05:14] Tayyun: Scripe gets replaced by a AI soon LuL
[2:05:22] paosdaloa: What i dont get is, if artists are artists because they like to create or love to make things, how come its a problem if someone else makes that too even if its AI.
[2:05:27] Hozzar1: so what we've learnt is that getting world first holds no meaning and only has subjective value HmmNotes
[2:05:41] berylia_berret: HmmNotes
[2:05:45] mohaso21: KEKW
[2:05:45] Micwini: ACtually correct

[2:05:47] WegPiraat404: KEKW
[2:05:50] FatherSalvi: KEKW
[2:05:51] korimiii: WF>all
[2:05:53] Eliannoula: let him cook xD
[2:05:54] berylia_berret: stunlocked the streamer KEKL
[2:05:56] Tayyun: KEKW
[2:05:59] Ysida: we need AI world first race
[2:06:06] mohaso21: he is cooking
[2:06:09] Micwini: Yeah but actually winning doesn't
[2:06:11] Kingcoconutcrab: Man, you missed the holistic standpoint: Charity
[2:06:12] aavegotchi1221: PEOPLE CAN WATCH AI TOO?
[2:06:12] Kingcoconutcrab: bruh
[2:06:20] WegPiraat404: Fridge
[2:06:22] aavegotchi1221: AI CAN ORGANISE STUFF???
[2:06:23] paosdaloa: Watch ofc
[2:06:24] aavegotchi1221: HUHHH
[2:06:25] mohaso21: hahahah oh no not that again
[2:06:26] mohaso21: KEKW
[2:06:27] Kingcoconutcrab: "We race to world first for Charity"
[2:06:29] MoonKyun: Yep and that's the same conversation with a piece of art that's being discussed
[2:06:29] AfektGGBG: YEP
[2:06:31] berylia_berret: watch the RWF NODDERS
[2:06:32] paosdaloa: Why would i prolong my death with food
[2:06:35] Tayyun: World first players gets nice elgato stuff :O
[2:06:36] Arthars: watch RWF EZ
[2:06:36] Kemskemss: RWF for sure. who needs food
[2:06:38] paosdaloa: When i can enjoy my remaining time
[2:06:42] Tayyun: so thats true
[2:06:48] mohaso21: i need the food
[2:06:52] korimiii: i would starve to see scripe destroy another headset
[2:07:09] Micwini: @Scripe To whom does it provide value? I'm certain you guys get paid and all, but you don't get all of it. Where does it go? That is the question to ask :)
[2:07:24] FatherSalvi: the opinions that hold weight in this world are opinions expressed through money (or lack thereof)
[2:07:43] MoonKyun: People won't stop using it because it is easy to fool normal consumers and it is easy to generate AI art
[2:07:51] MoonKyun: Money talks
[2:08:06] Micwini: There is a movie about that
[2:08:13] paosdaloa: 55.5% of voters are liers
[2:08:29] MoonKyun: @paosdaloa Or they don't care about a measly 10k (for them) LOL
[2:08:31] rei__03: i mean you risk someone important to you would die
[2:08:37] AfektGGBG: Shruge random ppl dies all the time
[2:08:40] MoonKyun: And what rei said lol
[2:08:49] Tayyun: and the comment under xD
[2:08:49] mohaso21: if i know i will be the cause of someones death then iam not taking it
[2:08:55] WegPiraat404: @rei__03 that chance would be so slim though
[2:08:59] Arthars: but if u dont know someone will die, would u takje it? Despairge
[2:09:01] Kingcoconutcrab: @Scripe  that is very similar to the Trolley problem (philosophical ethics thought experiment)
[2:09:05] AfektGGBG: yeah just a meme
[2:09:06] Ysida: 10k $ is low lets raise it to 100k and then 1kk and u will see how the % will change
[2:09:07] paosdaloa: it says "random" so you dont know him/her/it/they/zer/zor/zir/them
[2:09:18] paosdaloa: sorry if i missed some
[2:09:20] Micwini: @rei__03 This is a really microscopic chance. And I think the most thinking mistake people make here is that they assume a good person would die. You could kill a terrible human being too.
[2:09:22] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[2:09:24] foggyfr: You randomly kill the budda or something
[2:09:30] FatherSalvi: there is no morality in poverty
[2:09:31] WegPiraat404: @paosdaloa you missed helicopter
[2:10:04] rei__03: personally i wouldn't press it, even if the chance that my mom for example would die is silm
[2:10:07] mohaso21: if i know iam the cause of death of someone else iam not taking the money
[2:10:14] Dezpyer: Imagine someone would take that 10 grand and someone of your family dies. Most of the people would get furious
[2:10:23] Kemskemss: it would be curious to know how many yes would change to no, if ppl had to see that person dying
[2:10:52] Hozzar1: i wouldn't care and just take the mone
[2:10:56] Hozzar1: money
[2:10:59] AfektGGBG: YEP ppl dont care
[2:11:12] jpacoelho: this pool from mr beast shows me why democracy sucks
[2:11:17] Blas0n: good morning from cali @Scripe
[2:11:38] Micwini: test
[2:11:43] Blas0n: good man finally killed tindral almost disbanded @Scripe
[2:11:50] Ysida: i would take Yes to kill other people that choose Yes Kappa
[2:11:55] Micwini: You have to factor in that your likelyness of pressing 'no' increases with how much you have. You will see that this % would change with the same people making the choice, if you would move the number of cash higher or lower
[2:12:16] Kemskemss: @Ysida oh no, bloody rabbit hole
[2:12:19] foggyfr: eye for an eye leaves all blind lols
[2:12:37] Zeppe899: Vastly depends on the subjects situation I'd say. A wealthy person will have drastically different takes than someone poor
[2:12:46] Ihgfdh: squid game?
[2:12:46] Coil666: squidgame
[2:12:48] mohaso21: i would take yes to kill demo warlock players Kappa
[2:12:50] rei__03: fun? monkaS
[2:12:58] FatherSalvi: I'd press yes 1000 times :)
[2:13:08] mohaso21: KEKW
[2:13:10] Kingcoconutcrab: then Yes
[2:13:20] Ihgfdh: KEKL
[2:13:20] rei__03: but you deplete the key xD
[2:13:20] FatherSalvi: KEKW
[2:13:22] Kingcoconutcrab: xd
[2:14:52] Kingcoconutcrab: depends on your goal, but this is not a discussion
[2:14:58] rei__03: people don't like asmon because he's a goblin
[2:15:04] Kingcoconutcrab: this is ventilating his own opinion
[2:15:44] Kingcoconutcrab: I think Asmongold might start a religion soon
[2:16:11] Ysida: Blocker is very important in the discussion
[2:16:37] rei__03: dm him Pog
[2:16:52] Kingcoconutcrab: I think it's a very depressing way of living to think like that
[2:17:03] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[2:17:24] Kingcoconutcrab: yeah, but that's people with general lower empathy
[2:17:31] Ysida: i would love to choose % how many Americans thinks that
[2:17:46] SticksonTV: Honestly, how the world looks right now. There cant be many that care about anyone but them selfs
[2:18:01] SticksonTV: depressing af, but kinda rought living nowadays haha
[2:18:14] Kingcoconutcrab: I cba
[2:18:23] rei__03: he's too based
[2:18:24] Ihgfdh: BASED
[2:18:29] MoonKyun: Because they hate him in the first place lol
[2:18:49] MoonKyun: If you hate somebody you will try to not 'go on their side'
[2:18:58] berylia_berret: hes mastered the art of being a centrist. its very difficult to try to "cancel" him
[2:19:12] mohaso21: i wouldn't care
[2:19:30] MoonKyun: Most people hating someone else will want to even disagree with their opinions
[2:19:36] mohaso21: ye thats for sure
[2:19:56] MoonKyun: It's p insane mindset ye lol
[2:20:31] rei__03: kinda what happens LUL
[2:20:32] neqel: They're not even listening to what he's saying. They just find isolated parts that fit something they can get mad about. This is why people get cancelled. It's always jsut a loud minority who doesn't even know what they're arguing against
[2:20:51] Ysida: the truth is Asmongold never cared about "copyrights" if he could he will play "Freddie Mercury" songs in his stream but the law forbidden it
[2:20:55] domax92: I hate asmon for hating wow, most times with very idiotic arguments.
[2:21:23] mohaso21: its like saying i hate Scripe for  inviting DKs to my parties all the time Kappa
[2:22:52] rei__03: game is fun you play it, if it isn't you don't
[2:23:10] sw0ngs: surely they wouldnt make a game and launch it without finding out if they are infringing on existing games etc
[2:23:12] roadroller_dah: you dont need to defend nintendo, if they want to persue legal action they will
[2:23:25] Deonardocilaprio: I believe in free speech. Asmon can say what he wants, like everybody should be allowed to.
[2:23:40] mohaso21: KEKW
[2:23:44] Ysida: i think its silly, i mean how we can even respect the dude who lives from rewatching other people work.
[2:23:45] WegPiraat404: i mean they can just replace models over time
[2:23:54] mohaso21: iam gonna download it today and try it
[2:23:57] roadroller_dah: documentary on mental twitter users
[2:24:05] rei__03: but don't assume that will happen
[2:24:33] AfektGGBG: Susge
[2:24:38] berylia_berret: Susge
[2:24:43] mohaso21: @Ysida why does giving him the respect matter from how he lives his life
[2:25:09] Arthars: youtube videos went from "dont steal my work" into "omg i hope EVERYONE reacts to this!!!"
[2:25:13] Arthars: the meta changed man
[2:25:19] sw0ngs: but at the end of the day, bad publicity is better than no on talking about the game
[2:25:21] domax92: He finds excuses to hate wow cause it's mainatream now
[2:25:21] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[2:25:36] berylia_berret: React meta was definitely not there before Aware
[2:25:38] Hozzar1: YES
[2:25:40] Arthars: ITS ME AND IM STRUGGLING IN MYTHIC FYRAKK MAN
[2:25:41] Hozzar1: yes it is
[2:25:44] Eliannoula: uts real arthas
[2:25:48] Tionner: Yes
[2:25:48] Arthars: HOW THE HELL DO U GUYS KILL IT PRE NERF
[2:25:49] MoonKyun: @domax92 What if he idk hates the game lol
[2:25:49] Eliannoula: aaaand he malding again xD
[2:25:55] AfektGGBG: Shruge looks like an AI bot to me
[2:26:04] Tionner: Fake one Kappa
[2:26:04] Laikadaisical: you can choose to disable the verified icon
[2:26:18] Lorrdzik: @Ysida many people thanks him for reacting to their content if they dont like it and say it to him he doesnt react anymore
[2:27:07] domax92: Like you have to realese and walk back... Lol locks are There for a reason... Or too much trash (almost none in this raid) or the game Is top hard... Lol
[2:27:19] Ysida: @Lorrdzik yeah that is true, sometimes its <-> benefits the creator, but i think yt should have strict options where creator choose if other can react or not.
[2:27:20] AfektGGBG: pokemons fans are just mad nintendo didnt do it before pal world KEKL
[2:27:32] 4stronauth: KEKW
[2:27:44] Honvar: The judge is playing it as well KEKW
[2:27:55] Loonamara: I feel like remixes in music are a lot more controversial than these topics, and those did fine
[2:28:01] aavegotchi1221: What is Rapid Eye Movement that you stated in your description?
[2:28:13] rebeusauvage12: it all depends on the patent that nintendo has, if the patents are explicit enough about the style (and has been accepted that way) then they would lose it in front of a court
[2:28:14] Loonamara: Like remixes don't have to add anything to the track, but they're legally allowed and generally enjoyed by the public
[2:28:41] Clox9: I really need a new mmo
[2:29:06] roadroller_dah: but both of these games are japenese
[2:29:07] fluupie: patents can be challenged also etc afterwards even if granted
[2:29:10] roadroller_dah: not american
[2:29:13] Ysida: @Scripe can you imagine if asmongold will be sued the judges would have to rewatch his 2h long videos
[2:29:31] Eliannoula: nintendo tried suing the devs of temtem but lost so i doubt they'd be able to success here now as well
[2:29:35] rebeusauvage12: @fluupie depends on the country, in some countries you can't challenge patents if they are granted
[2:29:41] roadroller_dah: @Eliannoula did they actually?
[2:29:44] aavegotchi1221: lmao
[2:29:46] Eliannoula: @roadroller_dah yep
[2:29:53] Loonamara: Asmongold can make content out of anything it's kind of admirable tbh LUL
[2:29:59] MoonKyun: Temtem is literally a pokemon clone
[2:30:03] MoonKyun: With multiplayer
[2:30:04] Eliannoula: temtem is more of a pokemon game than palworld
[2:30:32] rebeusauvage12: but to me (as som1 who knows a bit about the world of patents) it seems like nintendo can't sue them based on the patents they have atm, coz they wouldve done it if they knew it was 100% win
[2:30:35] roadroller_dah: @Eliannoula could you pm me a link to an article if you know of one
[2:30:40] Loonamara: Nintendo loves to sue people so i'm kind of glad that it's happening to them
[2:30:50] roadroller_dah: it is
[2:31:00] MoonKyun: I'd definitely sue if I were nintendo already, should patents be infringed
[2:31:10] MoonKyun: Nintendo is almost the Disney of videogames
[2:31:15] Micwini: Sorry, but those 2 are completely different
[2:31:17] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[2:31:33] Clox9: dark and darker now this
[2:31:59] Elfomal: Its nice for those kids today to have the same old drama of 'pokemon plagiarized digimon' that we had on 90s
[2:32:00] MoonKyun: Well dark and darker did yoink assets lol
[2:32:19] WegPiraat404: tem tem gameplay looks the same to pokémon though
[2:32:26] Loonamara: I don't think nintendo should have a monopoly on cute fantasy animals, i feel like they almost do.
[2:32:28] MoonKyun: @WegPiraat404 Because it is a pokemon clone
[2:33:21] mohaso21: do we skip full blast keys tmw? and i go do some alt stuff YEP @Scripe
[2:34:16] rebeusauvage12: actually i think its impossible for nintendo to win this in court (based on the style, in EU) bcz its really hard to be granted patents based on style (think of the nike v bape case)
[2:34:37] Loonamara: Not really, you can care about the art and not the artist, which is actually the best way to view aritsts and content creators imo
[2:34:41] Micwini: Don't artists make art because they enjoy it themselves? If you make art for others to create value.... now that is a capitalistic view
[2:34:43] mohaso21: okay
[2:34:45] berylia_berret: Its more of caring if art should continue to exist or not. People value art more than others
[2:34:48] ver_flashbang: Hi I'm an IT specialist, why do ppl only care about the quality my work and not about me? LuL
[2:34:53] mohaso21: hahahah
[2:34:58] mohaso21: your fav
[2:35:00] itznashman: we expect artists to be a little loopy, if someone in academia goes weird, it seems a bit off
[2:35:03] blue321: Incoporeal
[2:35:03] Loonamara: I watch streamers but i don't care about them, they get ad revenue, i get entertainment, i don't have to bother about their personal lives
[2:35:06] Ysida: @Micwini artist have to feed family aswell xd
[2:35:07] Coil666: incorp
[2:35:14] mohaso21: HGAHAHAHAH
[2:35:20] Tionner: KEKW
[2:35:29] mohaso21: can just chill
[2:35:32] blue321: 2 weeks after this week are free
[2:35:35] Deonardocilaprio: This week is sanguine, I am in pain
[2:35:42] Loonamara: @ver_flashbang Yeah, basically this; I wish people would realize how dumb "care about artists" arguments are in the larger scope of things
[2:35:43] Ysida: @Ysida we can't even imagine how many artist changes to draw porn to pay their bills
[2:35:50] itznashman: its always a nice challenge every week :D
[2:35:51] Micwini: @Ysida If they want to feed their family maybe they should make better art that sells or find work that actually contributes value to society :P
[2:36:01] mohaso21: bursting and entangling
[2:36:03] roadroller_dah: @Eliannoula i cant find any information about nintendo suing tem tem
[2:36:06] roadroller_dah: d4 sucks
[2:36:19] Ysida: @Micwini you can draw something that is 0 valuable to you and valuable to someone else its subjective
[2:36:22] mohaso21: and tyrannical
[2:36:25] Eliannoula: @roadroller_dah me neither in a quick search
[2:36:26] Deonardocilaprio: I think Asmon is usually right yeah
[2:36:38] roadroller_dah: @Eliannoula where did you hear they got sued
[2:36:42] itznashman: hes more careful than right
[2:36:55] bisinis: he isnt as dumb as ppl make him to be imo
[2:36:57] Loonamara: Asmon's right here, but people who agree with him just don't care enough to argue with the twitter mob LUL
[2:36:59] Eliannoula: @roadroller_dah its been years
[2:37:00] Micwini: @Ysida That is true, but that relates in no way to the statement on 'artists have to feed family'.
[2:37:01] mohaso21: @Scripe bursting entangling and Tyrannical is next week
[2:37:02] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[2:37:19] roadroller_dah: @Eliannoula hm k, but i think if they didnt go after tem tem palworld is safe in my opinion
[2:37:31] itznashman: asmons from texas he wants to shoot everything
[2:37:31] Eliannoula: @roadroller_dah same
[2:37:40] Thdlock: its bad
[2:37:41] roadroller_dah: everyone says d4 sucks
[2:37:41] rei__03: d4 bad

[2:37:46] guldoniss: its bad
[2:37:50] Ysida: @Micwini for example you can only draw and you finished the school only knowing this. you might A choose other carrier path or B draw something that people wants
[2:37:52] roadroller_dah: yes
[2:37:53] Tionner: KEKW 󠀀

[2:48:03] Loonamara: Smite 2 Aware
[2:48:05] Hebiiro: but u get infinite gameplay loop
[2:48:12] berylia_berret: You would have to pay a little bit to enjoy the game more such as bank stashes and other inventory related things
[2:48:16] roadroller_dah: dont think so
[2:48:28] Clox9: @theoddvan I tried it for 100 hours f2p isnt bad to get your feet wet
