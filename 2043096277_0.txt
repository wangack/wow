[1:03:17] hadeskrieg: Hardcore or SOD, nothing else
[1:03:30] flowerpew: nobody wants to play era, not even classic andies savixOld
[1:03:35] ceea: i started on retail 6 months ago and now only play sod
[1:03:39] 3Brick_: @Guzu i made my cousin start play SoD and he hated Classic, but he loves it now since he is more casual
[1:03:41] mlady_telegramz97: @phantiism thats why i love playing on private servers ppl are so wholesame guzuL
[1:03:46] Yvernaa: SoD is friendly, new and more casual which is nice
[1:03:49] garagar_wow: Honestly saying economy is such a cop out argument especially as a streamer let alone there is so much gold buying going on. Its been screwed since its started.
[1:03:57] sadon22: if we missed sod phase 1 can we catch up or is too late?
[1:04:04] Yvernaa: @sadon22 Never too late
[1:04:10] mlady_telegramz97: @sadon22 of course not, there always time
[1:04:10] 3Brick_: @sadon22 easy catch up

[1:04:27] shrektard69: era is boring asf
[1:04:28] flowerpew: sadon22 if you play once a day you'll be ahead of guzu in a week
[1:04:28] Ceodewd: sadon22 nah, you will maybe miss out on the BFD raid hype, but you will be ready for the next round of raiding
[1:04:38] thargonian: and it will never move past naxx
[1:04:41] hadeskrieg: progression yes
[1:04:42] GeniTV: progressing is always fun
[1:04:42] ladiciusbtw: more like 3 years
[1:04:45] Niksen_99: People make alot of alts in ERA
[1:04:48] CamGG__: I fell in love with wow thanks to SoD. Did wotlk 1-80 after watching you and savix. now im completely hooked on classic sod.
[1:04:49] garagar_wow: Thats fair but that's not an economy argument that's a fully progressed server
[1:04:55] Misterballe: progression is what makes the game fun imo
[1:04:56] TheGreattDane: Whens BFD reset?
[1:04:59] mlady_telegramz97: @itscamgg pogg
[1:05:02] Coalmanite_: is there any fresh start servers on retail?
[1:05:03] nsoriano13: Catching up on Palworld vods. Can you slow down a bit on the stream @Guzu
[1:05:11] Misterballe: when everybody is at more or less the same stage
[1:05:28] CamGG__: @mlady_telegramz97 savixHug
[1:05:36] ShingaTV: nature of bots you mean
[1:05:43] Dunkdk: I started era some time before SOD, when i reached 60 I couldn't join raids unless I had gold to join GDKP. No normal raid groups. So I stopped
[1:05:48] mlady_telegramz97: @coalmanite_ i would recommend you to either play on roleplaying servers or servers that are tagged with "new players"
[1:05:54] Niksen_99: There is also just 1 layer on Classic ERA.. So botting + 1 layer will make everything expensive
[1:06:01] mlady_telegramz97: @coalmanite_ because ppl are very supportive there
[1:06:04] Trexbo_: YEP
[1:06:09] Karntar: YEP
[1:06:12] Yvernaa: I would honestly enjoy retail if I had a guild or friends, it's boring playing alone guzuStare

[1:08:24] Colddaylight: And then after 3 months they get a new fresh? Keep classic as it is.. the NEW fresh hype is nothing more but a repeat of steps
[1:08:27] inspect4: 25% drop in few weeks is huge
[1:08:31] Lorkahn: peepoWOTLK
[1:08:33] Qwas_Blank: came back to leveling in hc and saw 5 hunters with the same pet name farming bears and spiders around tarren mill for hours without breaks. HC players are really dedicated
