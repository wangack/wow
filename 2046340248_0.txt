[0:11:34] dyllbarx: haha
[0:11:50] wyldeshock: @venruki never played mage but going to gear one. Arcane or Fire?!?!
[0:12:09] middlebeach: You will never believe this but I was able to get an IRL friend who has never played before hooked on wow pvp.
[0:12:14] nikthevoker: how would YOU KNOW dyll!
[0:13:00] wyldeshock: hmm. I like the look of both. May try fire
[0:13:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Left alone, fire mages can blast so hard when they are off in the distance
[0:13:59] Badasti: Yo
[0:14:06] middlebeach: Yes but it makes you a magnet to melee
[0:14:15] Badasti: all good thanks man, how are you today?
[0:14:16] vmills: morning Ven hope your doing well today
[0:14:24] atoker: there are a lot of collectors in the game that are trying to increase their rankings so they ask for stuff to be re-released
[0:14:37] KOSTA_XB: its an old mount its not going to matter after a few days
[0:14:39] gelatokush: learning it is the hard part :D
[0:14:47] wyldeshock: I love spellsteal
[0:14:54] wyldeshock: best button in the game
[0:15:11] ozzyxy: I want a 2004 detroit pistons championship ring
[0:15:15] Badasti: I feel like i have a fundamental differencei n values with people who want participation awards
[0:15:16] KOSTA_XB: lol
[0:15:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: New players collecting all the mounts is wrong, I agree
[0:15:34] Datguyjay: @ozzyxy Chauncey Billups FMVP Trophy next trading post
[0:15:42] ozzyxy: @Datguyjay LMAO
[0:15:46] KOSTA_XB: at the end of the day are you playing a game and having fun
[0:15:49] ozzyxy: I want the ben wallace headband please!!
[0:15:53] MaximumnNeo: humanity in a nutshell
[0:15:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of those are supposed to be special rewards for doing something at a time when it was hard
[0:16:16] Badasti: @KOSTA_XB for some people working hard to accomplish things that not everyone can do is part of the fun. There are literally thousnds of rewards and achievements that are easy to get
[0:16:32] middlebeach: I spend 12 hours a day collecting mounts and can't break 2k in arena. Why shouldn't I deserve the ruthless gladiator mount for 500 tinder right?
[0:16:35] pugulus_prime: I just don't understand why people even care enough to want old things readded. its just pixels to me
[0:17:07] wyldeshock: it drives people to be better and earn it
[0:17:18] CabinetMistake: surely they make enough money and we spend enough time in game to warrant something >new<, as well...
[0:17:19] brokegamer13: yea thats what makes the game Great for OGs ... like i have both ZA Bear Mounts .. would suck to see others have them
[0:17:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: The only time a special mount bothered me was when it gave a speed advantage, that doesn't exist anymore
[0:17:32] vmills: it would be so lame if me at 2k was able to get glad mounts. I would feel like I didn’t earn it and lose that feeling of accomplishment
[0:17:34] What_ln_Tarnation: i also like to live in a world Pog
[0:17:38] zachgamegodx: sunday with nunruki
[0:17:44] vmills: that’s like paying for a carry lol
[0:18:12] Zumaji: it would still be nice if you had to earn  it. Like what if they added recolored elite sets back for you to buy similar to the vicious mounts. But you have to be at least elite and win games in elite to progress a bar to earn a token
[0:18:20] Badasti: @abstracthunts unattainable awards such as the old glad mounts afaik
[0:18:21] KOSTA_XB: i have mounts that i never use so i dont  find it a big deal  but its just me i guess
[0:18:21] Zumaji: something like that would be fine with me
[0:18:54] ozzyxy: this whole argument reminds of a convo w. a religious person
[0:18:58] ozzyxy: check mate at every corner
[0:18:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was way harder to get ahead of the curve before weakauras
[0:19:20] pugulus_prime: I guess I'm lucky I don't really have attachment to cosmetics in this game I just play for fun
[0:19:20] tarth_100: @ozzyxy lmao
[0:19:31] nikthevoker: i want my welfare glad mounts!
[0:19:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: There were some cheese addons at times, but in general it was harder to get the big stuff done fast
[0:19:44] JmanOwnz: i don't have the mount, but i think it sets a bad precedent. But doesn't feel like anything is sacred anymore
[0:19:55] Badasti: @nikthevoker ironically once they get them welfare they will lose all value
[0:20:13] mvpthegoatt: can u do a harder heals like rsham ?
[0:20:14] ozzyxy: @tarth_100 Gods Plan.
[0:20:33] jhambone24: Which mount may be coming back?
[0:20:36] SharmaJenkins: @mvpthegoatt he does play rsham too
[0:20:36] tarth_100: @ozzyxy can't even count the number of times my eyes glaze over when met with those types of religious arguments lol
[0:20:43] atoker: I got the ksm mount in season 3 of SL, but I don't mind if people get it for free
[0:21:07] HawteyTV: ROFL
[0:21:09] What_ln_Tarnation: did he bubble?
[0:21:10] CabinetMistake: gosh darn
[0:21:13] CabinetMistake: did he bubble?
[0:21:18] Badasti: poor dude, thats not a good feeling
[0:21:18] Zumaji: I feel like my thoughts have changed since having a kid, since I don;t have the time to play as much. Like I'm ok with them adding back elite sets from previous seasons to as long as you have to hit elite to earn them like vicious mounts
[0:21:27] gelatokush: is it just me or working hard for achievement/rewards meta died a long time ago, people just want instant gratification now days in game or irl
[0:21:31] Zumaji: would constantly give me something to play for on alts
[0:21:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Siege of Orgrimmar AOTC Mount may be coming to the trading post, that's the issue
[0:21:47] Zumaji: But recolors
[0:21:49] shugguls: tbh i didnt play wod due to having a family so i will be happy to have it
[0:21:53] Zumaji: not the actual sets
[0:21:55] chronicfuels: tired of solo shuffle lobbies coming down to one superior healer. but thats the game i guess
[0:21:59] Zumaji: yeah thats what i mean recolors
[0:22:13] zachgamegodx: ya like the amani war bear and amani battle bear, the original still definitely feels special to have but its essentially the same mount
[0:22:13] atoker: yeeah so there's distinction, I agree
[0:22:17] wyldeshock: I wish they’d bring back the red enchant but it would ruin it…
[0:22:29] CabinetMistake: i'm like rooting for the paladin now lol
[0:22:29] pugulus_prime: The issue is that recoloring it takes more work then just slapping the originals back in
[0:22:36] appleMONST3R: this feels like a starbelly sneeches thing
[0:23:16] MaximumnNeo: i think they could bring stuff back if they made the same requirements. Like if it was Ahead of the curve, you have to have current ahead of the curve to get it. Or for Elite sets you have to get the rating they were originally at
[0:23:20] gelatokush: scorpion mount ithink
[0:23:22] xBenty: Still the man after all this time @venruki
[0:23:23] pugulus_prime: @abstracthunts its the  Kor'Kron War Wolf
[0:23:30] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy xBenty WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:23:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reins of the Kor'kron War Wolf was datamined, it looks pretty cool
[0:23:46] CabinetMistake: they could at least do it with a mount i want, like that glowing moose from aotc in...wod?
[0:23:49] nikthevoker: glad requirements were changed too, so its alot easier now to get
[0:24:06] mathiasp19: what are the glad requirements right now?
[0:24:16] nikthevoker: 50 wins over 2.4
[0:24:21] yesterday_potato: Im trying hard in pvp cause i want the rewards. If i just get those eventually with marks of honor i would find another game as it seems pointless.
[0:24:32] mathiasp19: in 3s or anywhere?
[0:24:35] Farfetchdxx: is 2.4+ still extremely hard to get?
[0:24:48] belvedee: @nikthevoker depends on the szn and when you get it i suppose
[0:24:50] shugguls: @Farfetchdxx ohhhhh yes , less ppl playing as well
[0:24:58] gelatokush: still pretty hard to get glad unless youve been playing for long time and have people to queu with
[0:24:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: The gladiator mounts are freaking awesome, I wouldn't ever want those purchasable with trader's tenders
[0:25:21] ozzyxy: LMAO
[0:25:22] Sosatko: Kekw
[0:25:22] tarth_100: lmao
[0:25:25] pharmztko: true

[0:25:25] shivwren: TRUE

[0:25:28] What_ln_Tarnation: KEKW
[0:25:29] belvedee: most zoomer shit i've heard lol
[0:25:31] arcane_p: lol
[0:25:35] JBugaboo: what if i identify as a person that has the amani war bear
[0:25:35] arcane_p: that's hilarious
[0:25:37] nikthevoker: i lost faith in humanity awhile ago
[0:25:38] JBugaboo: but dont have it
[0:25:42] kornystreamz: i feel him he ain't wrong @venruki
[0:25:45] tarth_100: @Farfetchdxx its currently pretty hard, only 800 people 2400+
[0:25:46] didgeridoo1001: BAHAHA WOW is ageist!
[0:25:52] appleMONST3R: what does it matter if someone else also has the mount or mog that you have? why would you care?
[0:25:52] brokegamer13: there are also rumors that The Longboi will be in the trading post .. for like 20k
[0:25:57] nikthevoker: you have to tell lpeope how to do their jobs LUL
[0:26:00] arcane_p: @JBugaboo yo you have me in tears lmao
[0:26:06] billytwoshoe: yeah my s2 tbc glad drake and naax no deaths achievement title are the only things I look back at something that took work .... it would be really annoying if those came back
[0:26:09] Somanie: I made my own WoW acct in 2015 and lost a lot of mounts I got on my uncles acct (I played on it when he was at work bc my mom couldn't afford a computer). I'm lowkey excited about these re-released mounts 👀
[0:26:18] Zumaji: Like here's my idea, you hit elite, then you fill a bar similar to the vicious mount progress. Once full you get a token and then you can buy a recolor of old elite sets. Thats a cool idea for me. Like im fine not having the actual set from mop on my monk because i wasnt an elite player so i don't deserve it
[0:26:35] middlebeach: We both pay the same monthly rate, why would you deserve any exclusive mount morethan me
[0:26:38] CabinetMistake: COME ON PALADIN
[0:26:40] CabinetMistake: YES
[0:26:42] ozzyxy: ja morants out here gunnin pallies down
[0:26:57] ATHLTE: ^ lmaoooo
[0:26:58] Reuhn: I have 750 mounts and dont care about old exclusive mounts. there are so many of them it's "whatever" at this point
[0:27:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think the Longboi needs to come back, but we could use another AH mount
[0:27:19] gelatokush: we want a AH mount
[0:27:24] JBugaboo: longboi is still available via bmah
[0:27:26] nargonisttv: Ah Venruki-san Roleplaying as a nun.
[0:27:37] JBugaboo: they just need to make a dragonflight ah mount tbh
[0:27:40] DevobotOCE: Venruki my man, what's good? rukiWave
[0:27:43] gelatokush: nah i agree fuck long boi need a new one
[0:27:45] CabinetMistake: @wEiRdO_dUdE yeah that's my thought as well, they make so much money i don't get why they can't just make new stuff lol
[0:27:47] Somanie: I want Grove Defiler to come back Sadge
[0:27:55] shugguls: so many Dh's
[0:28:06] laurksj: i wish i understood how to play this game
[0:28:10] ATHLTE: LOL
[0:28:15] Juarrior: its fun to play healer at shuffle?
[0:28:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember during the Shadowlands one time when the portals were borked and people couldn't get to Org... those Longbois let us do AH stuff in Oribos, that was nice
[0:28:21] tarth_100: The recolor mounts should also have a diferent name
[0:28:34] JBugaboo: replica elite set
[0:28:41] Zumaji: Yeah see i don't agree with that. I wasn't an elite player then so I don't deserve it.
[0:28:46] gelatokush: were u a better player back in 2008 tho MyAvatar
[0:28:58] pugulus_prime: I'd rather they make higher res versions of the older sets not just recolors
[0:29:04] Somanie: For me it really boils down to me wanting Blizzard to stop fucking playing with me and let me transfer my character to my new account so I can get all my mounts back

[0:29:50] ismithin: I would just like an off color of shadowlands glad. Sickiest model i've seen since I started in BFA
[0:29:52] nargonisttv: The giving out old achieve stuff is bogus. People want people to be able to get Challenge mode gear from MOP/WOD and it seems like BS to do so. To take away the effort players put in back in the day.
[0:29:54] ATHLTE: what we need is a new flametalon recolor
[0:30:02] Juarrior: yo ven! its fun to play healer at shuffle?
[0:30:05] MaximumnNeo: eh im of the opinion tbc was easier lol. I got glad with only half my buttons bound in 2s. Its way more sweaty now.
[0:30:09] arcane_p: they should never let you get those time limited glad mounts but they should re color them for newer players
[0:30:13] Somanie: "Can I transfer my character" "yeah" "OK bet, I'll do that" "you can not transfer your character" 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️
[0:30:37] gelatokush: nothing wrong with that
[0:30:38] Chadww: isn't that what the feats of strength are for?
[0:30:48] omnimicro: just make it say replica. still takes away from the old but makes more people happy
[0:30:49] JustTaki: They keep making cool and unique things every day why diminish the meaning of those memories
[0:30:53] Luigicamp: I don't think I've used a ground mount every since flying became available everywhere.
[0:30:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: If I had to guess, it's probably a small percentage of people who bought special mounts and stuff back in the day
[0:30:56] arcane_p: you you should have something that shows you was playing the game at that time that no one has
[0:30:58] absterge: omg pls let me get mop@challenge mode again for shaman, I had friends want to help me but I was too lazy and then I regretted it PLS ITS BEEN 12 YEARS
[0:31:03] aaggros: too many people want things they didnt work for
[0:31:09] Aramith9: I am too old to get r1 now so i should get the title
[0:31:13] Chadww: i'm not saying i want the old stuff back, i'm just saying that is one of the arguments. but who even looks at achievements anyway
[0:31:14] nargonisttv: Swift nether drake goated
[0:31:16] zachgamegodx: its a slippery slope, the achievement hunters may come after your season 1 glad achieve even
[0:31:23] Badasti: those netherdrakes are sweet. always been my favourite glad mount, and im happy with not having one
[0:31:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sterge LUL
[0:31:31] Thedruidtyler: @Aramith9 theres people that are like 40 that get rank 1
[0:31:32] renghost22: if you want mop challenge modes, just wait for MoP classic to come out in like 2 years Kappa
[0:31:35] vmills: not dogging on this conversation at all but is this even an issue has blizzard actually said they were bringing this back or hinted at it?
[0:31:35] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:31:38] gelatokush: so true
[0:31:38] ismithin: They should add effects to old armor/glad mounts if you have the achievment, so then its even color for the people who have it and collectors will have the +1 as well
[0:31:38] absterge: bring back mop challenge mode sets!!!
[0:31:40] JBugaboo: damn bro showing that off? how do you make it through the day with all that weight betwen your legs my guy

[0:32:40] demololtv: nice mount
[0:32:48] demololtv: can't wait to get it from travelers next month!
[0:32:50] Cdenzy: SOO AOTC Mount is going to be a traders post item
[0:32:50] Typhoid: dude based
[0:33:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: For drops, some special mounts  have been used, that did upset who paid a bunch for them
[0:33:09] Typhoid: i wish i could trade my vicious saddles for recoloured glad mounts
[0:33:16] Zumaji: I might be the only one but IDGAF about that mount, I want them to add in old Enchants and new enchants for me to mog lol
[0:33:22] nargonisttv: That's weak. I have that mount.
[0:33:28] Geektaztik: Ven, do you know what the best talents for spriest are right now in solo/3s?  There's a million builds out there floating around, curious of your thoughts
[0:33:36] nikthevoker: oh i got that
[0:33:39] antoxdd: thats the ONLY curve mount i have and they bring it back... out of the 20+ prolly curve mounts existing
[0:33:55] Somanie: They could have picked a boss that wasn't an 11min fight too tho
[0:33:59] dakotan517: but activision just wants $ i bet alot more stuff comes back
[0:34:08] belvedee: They should really stir the pot and add spectral tiger on the trading post
[0:34:19] absterge: yeah I honestly disagree with this. bringing back old mounts for the trading post? for casual content to earn it? they should’ve brought it back in the wow shop with a 6 month sub attached to it, pretty good deal for players!
[0:34:30] nightmxz: Yeah recolours are fine, if they updating the textures would be nice too since some of them have very few pixels
[0:34:31] zachgamegodx: THD is a nice fellow, but his takes are always completely odd
[0:34:37] tarth_100: lol major absterge troll inc
[0:34:38] D_Tram: everybody buiys AOTC any way.. wtf does it matter
[0:34:39] dakotan517: @absterge lol feldrake
[0:34:41] Luigicamp: probably people who haven't been taught the value of earning something.
[0:34:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those 6 month mounts do help to sell subs, I bet
[0:34:51] Badasti: 'dunk on someone' i swear people who have a problem with what you say see the world this way, and thats the real problem
[0:35:01] middlebeach: Who cares if somebody gets a cool mount. The only thing that really matters is if they can win against you in duels
[0:35:02] Badasti: its a cognitive distortion
[0:35:03] thuglovex: wrong is wrong even if everyone is for it and right is right even if everyone is against it. especially in todays backasswards world
[0:35:06] dakotan517: thats a based take
[0:35:07] absterge: imagine how cool this announcement would’ve been if you could buy it for $77.99
[0:35:12] dakotan517: all achieves purchasable
[0:35:15] monkeyjazz: A game I play polled the entire community in game if they should bring back skins that they said would previously be unobtainable after they left, and the majority actually voted to bring them back. But even with that, the devs saw enough feedback against it that they still decided to bring them back as recolours
[0:35:16] dakotan517: with dollars
[0:35:17] zachgamegodx: sounds like he's not earned anything that matters
[0:35:18] Typhoid: there is a large part of the player base that is younger that couldnt have got it either
[0:35:29] arcane_p: that's not fair because you can buy things in almost all online games
[0:35:30] ozzyxy: oops
[0:35:31] Zelowrath: Elliot the best looking wow player (besides me)
[0:35:36] felgazer: I swear wow people fight over the smallest things lol
[0:35:36] dakotan517: no
[0:35:37] omnimicro: i dont respect that spectral tiger cus it was duped so much in mop
[0:35:48] veil_dust: What healers to learn for solo bgs?
[0:35:51] tv_raz: wish i didnt sell my warrior account before achieves came out
[0:35:59] Adessius: maybe they can make a poll for it Kappa
[0:35:59] ATHLTE: @veil_dust MW Dragon
[0:36:05] MaximumnNeo: Im kind of in that boat. Its about the competition and earning the achievment. The reward isnt why people play.
[0:36:05] tastydayz: OUUUUUUUU THAT SMELLL!!!!!!
[0:36:17] tastydayz: THE SMELL THATS SURROUNDS MEE!!!!!
[0:36:22] vmills: recolor seems so obvious lol a slight recolor seem so easy. also agree with a new challenge to obtain
[0:36:43] nargonisttv: I compeltely disagree with that. Sucks that you didn't play
[0:36:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people do care
[0:36:53] Badasti: 100% disagree with that as well. I really dont like that sort of entitlement XD
[0:36:57] yesterday_potato: Man I swear it makes everything meaningless
[0:36:59] swolegreekgod: wolfgang has an awful take. New players shouldn't be handed exclusives that older players grinded for
[0:37:07] Badasti: people pretend like there arent literally thousands of other rewards they can get
[0:37:11] dakotan517: just let the classic accounts link to retail for achieve mounts
[0:37:15] Zumaji: Yeah if they want to truely just bring back old rewards. They at least need to make the people earn it in game with challenging content. So bring back old arena teams where you had play with the same 2 classes and couldn't que with other people. And if you left the team you lost all your raiding
[0:37:19] dakotan517: you did it while it was current round 2
[0:37:20] vmills: low key wouldn’t mind getting a way to obtain the pajamas transmog lolol I would love to work for it not just have it given to me
[0:37:26] Zumaji: so you better get good and make friends to hit elite
[0:37:34] Polyrhythmz: I don't like fomo. I'm cool with timed exclusivity (in that xpac for example). Idm if other people can earn the glad mounts I've earned. I don't think R1 titles should lose exclusivity though
[0:37:51] absterge: venruki’s boomer is showinfoxyllSMALL ￼ foxyllSMALL
[0:37:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[0:38:00] Luigicamp: age discrimination LMAO
[0:38:09] Bourbons86: Life is tough, wear a helmet
[0:38:10] Magottx: Ven gave inot the millenial trolls that night
[0:38:14] Magottx: into*
[0:38:16] W00dyyx: rukiOld
[0:38:18] vmills: boomer lol love it
[0:38:20] Ga11owZ: What is the topic?
[0:38:22] nikthevoker: i love how someone not getting what they want is "gate keeping" now LUL
[0:38:22] ViDDVuun: What about challenge modes back in MoP, I feel they should bring back the rewards because some people didnt play then. We pay for the game, we should get the full product.
[0:38:26] Luigicamp: tell him to unplug and go for a walk outside
[0:38:26] Badasti: honestly I think the world needs boomer mentality to make a comeback.
[0:38:33] Magottx: i am for sure...
[0:38:33] middlebeach: Money talks, bullshit walks.
[0:38:35] tarth_100: They really just need to do mage tower stuff again for recolors, that was very well executed
[0:38:40] tarth_100: They wont tho, cuz its too much effort
[0:38:43] absterge: ur def a boomer
[0:38:44] D_Tram: they should just put the swift spectral tiger in the Trading Post tbh... Asmons take on items that can be purchased with real money have 0 value any way
[0:38:51] Alerothan: Entitled
[0:38:51] MaximumnNeo: I guess for me if you look at real sports, athletes care about the achievement, not the reward.
[0:38:54] Unmercy__: greed
[0:39:01] nargonisttv: I think a lot of us that have been playing since vanilla/TBC have a similar feeling.
[0:39:06] Magottx: in life in general, if  you think you can buy a REWARD. its kids who grew up with participation rewards energy
[0:39:12] vmills: if everyone has everything nothing is worth having
[0:39:15] JustTaki: people are being ridiculous, ain't nobody realisitically want chevy to bring out the 1964 corvette out again so they can buy one and drive it now >.>
[0:39:19] aarongarey1993: I'm all of these
[0:39:28] aarongarey1993: I'm better than everyone
[0:39:36] thuglovex: I loved wow tcg
[0:39:37] that_man_ski: I like to collect old AOTC mounts. Sadly I haven't gotten very far. But now there is hope.
[0:39:39] swolegreekgod: good guy reckful
[0:39:41] AdamHeron12: what a god
[0:39:41] nikthevoker: ven im poor, i didnt earn a house gimme yours LUL
[0:39:44] lexiuss: <3
[0:39:44] thuglovex: I miss going to the store buying tcg packs
[0:39:47] ATHLTE: reckful such a g
[0:39:48] nightmxz: I'm just waiting for the wrath s7 glad mount to come on the trading post, it's my favourite :)
[0:39:55] thuglovex: pulled a magic rooster in a card store and freaked out
[0:39:56] absterge: foxyllSMALL can’t wait to q arena with venruki while only using my sick new wolf mount that was once an AOTC reward
[0:39:56] kralix: thats the best speccy t in the game than
[0:39:57] Typhoid: 11k usd mount
[0:39:58] ECH0F0XTR0T: It's a comparison of whether they keep more old/long time players by making these things exclusive, or appeal to more new players by making as much of the game accessible as possible
[0:39:59] Typhoid: jeeez
[0:40:05] flaccidarrow: @venruki It's kinda like the "giving everyone a gold medal for participating" thing
[0:40:06] ECH0F0XTR0T: Can't win both sides
[0:40:08] vmills: socialist commies lol
[0:40:15] Ga11owZ: I felt that same with the MOP collectors edition mount but thats in the shop now lol
[0:40:15] OGTweeter: Everyone just wants everything given to them now without doing any work.
[0:40:25] Badasti: @ECH0F0XTR0T they can, they just need to stop pandering
[0:40:30] brokegamer13: i think its cause you LIke Hiking
[0:40:31] CabinetMistake: i feel like values is a strong word for it lol it makes it sound like a deeper issue
[0:40:33] cbasszu: i agree with you 100% @venruki
[0:40:33] Badasti: they are ltierally just playing that game
[0:40:35] Badasti: and they shouldnt
[0:40:36] zachgamegodx: @venruki let's move on to oujtlaw rogues
[0:40:40] jayyArrington: they need to up drop rate on certain sht SHEEESH
[0:40:43] pugulus_prime: Lots of people seem to think that since they pay the sub they should get everything
[0:40:45] absterge: I feel like getting a recolor of old elite sets could be a cool reward tbh
[0:40:49] MaximumnNeo: @flaccidarrow not really, the olymics sell replica gold medals at the games as souvenirs, thousands of people buy them. Do you think Olympic champs care that fans have medals that look the same? not at all
[0:40:55] creamycreamie: And what about people who are capable of getting that stuff but they just weren't playing at the time
[0:41:08] seraph_wow: SAME LOL
[0:41:08] Askovan: Skill issue KEKW
[0:41:09] nikthevoker: where does it drop
[0:41:09] ATHLTE: bmah baby
[0:41:11] vmills: @absterge 100% also I got a prime sub for you today
[0:41:12] JustTaki: that's legit BS
[0:41:18] Sosatko: Weapon illusions are so underrated
[0:41:19] Zumaji: I get that enchant 4 times every year but can never get the rag one lol
[0:41:22] absterge: @vmills 👀👀👀
[0:41:23] Sosatko: I love illusions
[0:41:29] Paulypaychecks: putting a ticket in for you now
[0:41:31] nightmxz: Maybe if you were loyal to frost mage you'd have it
[0:41:31] Dirkdigglier: Ive tried the big love rocket for years on multiple chars
[0:41:32] jayyArrington: man shadowlands 1h swords is SO dope but never drops
[0:41:38] gelatokush: When you try your best, but you don't succeed When you get what you want, but not what you need When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
[0:41:41] absterge: we need recolors of old elite sets!!!
[0:41:43] thorin88: Yo
[0:41:45] MoiPapaFeodal: !drops
[0:41:46] Nightbot: VENRUKI has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the rewards! Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[0:41:46] Ga11owZ: You will get it 2 days before servers shut down Kappa
[0:41:51] that_man_ski: Would you trade a glad mount for the winters envoy enchant?
[0:42:08] nightmxz: @absterge you kid but I'd love some green recolours of old sets lol
[0:42:14] Joel_pink: man 2300-2400 mmr is so wild in 2s all R1 players
[0:42:19] twinbladeuk: Ven are you sensitive?
[0:42:21] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy OGTweeter WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:42:24] vmills: that is wild I got it on my first attempt I did not know it was rare. nice now I am the gate keeper none for you Ven :p
[0:42:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: MMO's are always a lot about appearance, not just achievements
[0:42:28] tarth_100: no one cares about some little log entry in your acheivement book. People want the mount or the title or the item whatever it is
[0:42:31] Zumaji: @absterge Sure but bring back old arena teams, where your rating is tied to the team and if you leave or someone else leaves your team is fucked and you have to restart from zero
[0:42:48] swolegreekgod: WoW fundamentally has always been a grinding game just giving old exclusive mounts out now is bullocks
[0:42:55] Badasti: oh for crying out loud
[0:43:00] Bigmoran: FILTHY CASUALS
[0:43:00] Badasti: what a wet nappy
[0:43:08] Typhoid: no one would care about buggati if we all owned them lol its rarity lends to the beauty
[0:43:17] ctrlbeesy: ^
[0:43:25] Magottx: It'd be dope if everyone could buy blizzcon winner titles too
[0:43:30] Ultramagnus85: lol
[0:43:38] atoker: give everyone brutosaurs
[0:43:44] nikthevoker: i think its a generational thing?
[0:43:45] TheKidRobin: yup
[0:43:45] atoker: lol
[0:43:45] Luigicamp: ofc
[0:43:46] Horse3000: 100% agree
[0:43:48] Ultramagnus85: true
[0:43:52] jayyArrington: the drop rates is kinda terrible atleast a little buff not megaor anything
[0:43:53] Badasti: I think the sad part is there are probably more people that actually agree with you, you just got sucked into a bit of an echo chamber of ideas tbh
[0:44:09] nightmxz: That's how I felt about them making glad 2400+ 50 wins, a lot easier to get (most seasons)
[0:44:12] vmills: lol that is exactly what I said above!! could not agree more
[0:44:17] epodlol: squeakers is S tier
[0:44:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[0:44:21] tv_raz: yup
[0:44:26] MrRaisin7: @venruki I wish they would bring back Arena Master
[0:44:26] JustTaki: Different take: Do we really want blizzard spending their limited resources recoloring old stuff or figuring out how to give us old stuff over making new stuff for us?
[0:44:32] gaulois62: nothiung of value
[0:44:33] shivwren: People use them a lot right after purchasing
[0:44:35] Badasti: the fact that we have an in-game store in a game that we pay a monthly sub for really gets my nuts in a twist
[0:44:35] ctrlbeesy: anyone can get it
[0:44:40] Dirkdigglier: As long as I can visually tell the difference between the Achievement version and a bought version I dont mind personally
[0:44:40] flaccidarrow: It's essentially people wanting a gold medal for participating
[0:44:41] ImJordanHi: I feel like its just a fundamental belief, I don't think its that complicated of a concept. People either feel entitled to things they didn't earn, and some people don't.
[0:44:42] EcstasyAeternus: i use sapphire skyblazer all the time tbh haha
[0:44:44] kappaMARS: TOP 5 MOUNTS in your opinion, GO!
[0:44:45] Ga11owZ: I use the imperial quillen every day and i have since i got it with MOP before it was a store mount
[0:44:46] Horse3000: I dont have any of the legion elite sets, tomb sets are the best in the game, I dont think they should ever bring them back
[0:44:53] tastydayz: never seen that sheeeeeeeee
[0:44:55] OGTweeter: OGTweeter subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[0:44:58] D_Tram: no
[0:45:00] nikthevoker: legion
[0:45:01] Nachofez: mythic antorus
[0:45:02] CabinetMistake: mythic antorus i thought
[0:45:06] RichP2Live: drop from argus mythic
[0:45:08] aarongarey1993: Have they announced when the new expansion is coming out? As I don't know if its too late too start playing df
[0:45:15] creamycreamie: They should make it so if you get multiple gladiator mounts in one season you can trade the extras for tokens to get recolors of old gladiator mounts.
[0:45:18] nikthevoker: mythic argus, also got still use it
[0:45:18] absterge: rukiCool chill out kids you didn’t earn this mount back in 2008
[0:45:19] jayyArrington: yeah watching palumor last night his transmog collection OD
[0:45:21] gelatokush: yea its like TCG rooster mount its so bad legit 2 pixel mount but people praise it cuz its rare
[0:45:21] zachgamegodx: ok
[0:45:27] vmills: your spot on across the board today sir
[0:45:30] shivwren: @aarongarey1993 end of the year, you have plenty of time
[0:45:42] jayyArrington: i didnt start playing wow till now so i dont have none xD
[0:45:49] Paulypaychecks: I WANT THAT MOUNT NOW THOUGH!
[0:45:49] nikthevoker: @venruki thats my top 3 fav mounts b/c i earned it top 10 NA raiding
[0:46:00] Typhoid: i wonder what brings new players this late into an mmorpg
[0:46:03] nikthevoker: only b/c i got it before
[0:46:03] twinbladeuk: blizz ware and will play to the casual playerbase
[0:46:04] forshard: some guy posted a manifesto to reddit, really in depth
[0:46:05] aarongarey1993: @shivwren oh good thanks so much matey
[0:46:07] Nachofez: i didnt get the aotc mount back then and i would hate if they make it available for everyone because it takes away the effort of people who got it back then
[0:46:09] jayyArrington: @Typhoid bordeom
[0:46:19] Somanie: I got a lot of mounts playing during the day while my uncle was at work. And again, I'm having a lot of trouble transferring my character, so I really like the re releases haha
[0:46:24] absterge: rukiCool¿¼ me? earned these mounts back in 08’ . rukiEw you? beg for the trading post or the wow shop to add it
[0:46:29] sparqTTV: 100% needs recolor if its on trading post
[0:46:31] afoscastro: as a new player i do look to the "elder" players flexing theyr mogs and mounts with respect, not envy
[0:46:42] Badasti: @absterge not my fault someone was just slacking off in a nutsack while I was out on the grind
[0:46:44] aarongarey1993: Why did he get banned
[0:46:45] zachgamegodx: seems really petty i wouldnt feed into this
[0:46:56] afoscastro: their*
[0:47:00] Drpzor: <3 <3 <3
[0:47:11] aarongarey1993: Oh good he didn't
[0:47:19] middlebeach: We are same rating and I'm in queue. See you on the battlefield
[0:47:29] Drpzor: @aarongarey1993 itS' just a timeout for link xd
[0:47:29] nikthevoker: @aarongarey1993 just auto timeout from linking
[0:47:34] yesterday_potato: while iI think it makes a great discussion, we dont know if this is for sure on trading post right?
[0:47:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: @aarongarey1993 probably just timed out for links
[0:47:37] vmills: can you allow his link, I’d like to check it out as well
[0:47:41] Badasti: i dont even think people are flexing on their mounts etc, I think they are proud of stuff they have accomplished and feel happy for them
[0:47:51] Dirkdigglier: I feel like a healer until i read the chat haha
[0:47:58] gelatokush: i fell like thats s otrue tho new players are the ones tha tcare about old stuff the least :D
[0:47:58] JustTaki: You are a hero. We don't deserve you
[0:47:59] Typhoid: it has a tender cost
[0:47:59] jamesip87: faking love fleetwood Mac
[0:48:01] Typhoid: fact
[0:48:03] Drpzor: @vmills go to reddit /worldofpvp, it's the top post of today
[0:48:08] jayyArrington: went a whole year tryna get shadowlands 1h QQ
[0:48:13] Joel_pink: i think everyone should have those tbh
[0:48:15] vmills: @drpzor thanks bud
[0:48:17] Somanie: To be 100% neutral, they picked the most c tier fucking aotc mount to potentially re release
[0:48:19] Drpzor: nps ^^
[0:48:23] aarongarey1993: What a banger
[0:48:23] Typhoid: unless blizzard trolling by giving it a tender cost lol
[0:48:29] Zumaji: Yeah what if they're bring back mythic SoO scaled up and that mount is now for ahead of the curve again
[0:48:40] whattheh3llbro: hey Ven personally i think blizzard should just come up with new cool mounts and leave old ones alone
[0:48:43] Somanie: Yay another wolf 🫥
[0:49:14] jdcraces: yeah i had that issue
[0:49:25] Cdenzy: what happened to them
[0:49:25] Zarkos: a lot of people had that issue with the MOP enchant
[0:49:32] galdinator: yea nobody held onto that shit
[0:49:38] Cdenzy: did they get vendored
[0:49:41] SharmaJenkins: cant u open a ticket for it?
[0:49:46] sparqTTV: I agree and just do recolors. it devalues the original if they don't @whattheh3llbro
[0:49:57] OGTweeter: sucks I don’t have the stuff I earned pre Cata that I destroyed back them to free up bank space
[0:49:57] Zumaji: Seriously? I had that issue @venruki but I just had to provide them with proof and I got them back. I;m sure you have vods from then you could send in?
[0:50:04] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy two_hat_cat WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:50:08] Badasti: @SharmaJenkins if you could it certainly wouldnt be now... Blizz CS has changed dramatically over the last few years and they've also had a bunch of layoffs recently
[0:50:43] Badasti: @Zumaji pretty sure almost everyone at Blizzard would know Ven earned these back in the day - he won Blizzcon back in the day XD
[0:51:24] middlebeach: Ven you must be a guitar or bass player swear.
[0:51:25] Dirkdigglier: Really impressive Ven can track his team mates with no friendly frames
[0:51:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mr. Kidney
[0:51:26] Zumaji: I know so Im confused he can't get them lol
[0:51:26] shrimpsmacker: swap in a kidney
[0:51:28] D_Tram: @Badasti Blizz didnt have a bunch of layoffs.. Activision Blizzard King had a bunch of layoffs.. not just wow team
[0:51:29] ImJordanHi: Why would they not give them to you...that's actually bizarre. Clearly earned, and the game has evolved which is why you didnt save them...(you didnt think you had to)
[0:51:29] goatjo___: lmaoo that was intentional

[0:52:20] gelatokush: yup back then being sub based game meant they provided you with customer service, people say hey sub is still 15$ never inflated but truth is they just cut back on every service they provided.
[0:52:24] shrimpsmacker: its fine they will put it up on the trading post soon enough

[0:58:36] vmills: idk why I am so bad at outlaw but I feel like it does such little damage and the windows to “burst” are so hard to get off correctly. I am a live lord but my damage is so bad
[0:58:39] shrimpsmacker: lol
[0:58:39] nikthevoker: the lobby dog
[0:58:41] llllliiilllii: ragnaros player ofc
[0:58:50] Badasti: tbf i'd hate to be playing into 2 shamans
[0:58:50] nerdyorc_: who is the weak link
[0:58:51] galdinator: yall both grenades
[0:58:52] Zeniticon: careful if its the shadow he might leave

[1:08:19] felgazer: Garbanzo Grenade LOL
[1:08:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Outlaw guy went 3-3
[1:08:37] JustApples_: play me some LSD and get high :^)
[1:08:38] CabinetMistake: you were gonna read that reddit post then go on your shaman
[1:08:38] middlebeach: Tinder mounts
[1:08:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Procpooper!
[1:08:46] JustApples_: justap24LOL
[1:08:50] Magottx: why does mmr carry over specs man..... just got a 100 rated rrdu at 2100

[1:09:26] stealthwalker99: enhancement sham time?
[1:09:41] tarth_100: There are some good points, not sure I agree with the take on balance.
[1:09:57] middlebeach: Venruki are you a fan of live music?
[1:10:03] Drpzor: yeah that is only justifiable xd the letter is pretty coherent and has continuity, so it'S probably worth reading as a whole without interruption
[1:10:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Enhancement has been doing crazy stuff when their RNG lines up
[1:10:22] JustApples_: what is the reddit post yall talking about?
[1:11:18] tv_raz: FOR SURE
[1:11:18] Ambersulfr: you know what really grinds my gears, when I have to drink my coffee without you.
[1:11:23] billytwoshoe: the ele mage tower unlock matches this season's shaman set perfectly
[1:11:29] CabinetMistake: leonard skeonard
[1:11:34] Ambersulfr: <3
[1:11:34] Drpzor: @JustApples_ it's on r/worldofpvp ^^
[1:11:38] gracioussatan: yessir. I love fleetwood mac

[1:11:40] seraph_wow: that was fleetwood mac not lynrd
[1:11:43] middlebeach: Lodi fuck ya
[1:11:54] trottiga: Started a prevoker 2 days ago, actually understand the love for Greenlizard now!
[1:11:55] Ambersulfr: hope you had a good morning
[1:11:58] Noxalis20: hey, looks like your finally feeling better
[1:12:36] slaughthemage: feeling better from what if i may ask? have u been unwell my friend?
[1:12:49] middlebeach: Any musicians in the chat?
[1:13:00] veil_dust: you've learn to deal with misery by playing healer in solo
[1:13:11] finnybae: YES
[1:13:16] finnybae: wrangle that jabroni
[1:13:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frost DK going ham
[1:13:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: And he's down...
[1:13:53] finnybae: geez lots of dam there
[1:14:10] stoutside: healing is fun
[1:14:22] middlebeach: Don't let that mmr drop to low or I won't be able to get in your lobby
[1:14:24] gracioussatan: I saw them play that song life and they waited for it to rain on us
[1:14:28] gracioussatan: live
[1:14:44] pvalue01: i always change my underwear after fighting a dev evoker
[1:15:43] ItsBees: D:
[1:15:44] CabinetMistake: just hit 70 i assume i should finish the campaign before i start (or can?) gearing up for pvp? peepoSad
[1:15:47] Ambersulfr: ven starting to sound like an rsham main, I love it
[1:15:47] finnybae: WutFace 2 much dam wtf
[1:15:47] CabinetMistake: holy that damage
[1:15:53] troniixlol: thats insane
[1:15:54] Ambersulfr: join us Ven, join the dark side
[1:15:55] pokra: is shaman just garbage?
[1:15:56] Ronn_Deezy: interesting
[1:16:03] chrye_xx: disgusting lol
[1:16:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: We got dragoned!
[1:17:27] kreyzy8: @pokra very lobby dependent in shuffle, and your team can easily grief you
[1:17:45] Thunder4o: Rsham whole skill kit is just way outdated for the current game,there must be rework
[1:18:03] Thunder4o: SLT-worst 3 min def cd in the game
[1:18:17] Ronn_Deezy: big juicy balls
[1:18:19] Ambersulfr: I want everyone to know Ven is playing insane rn
[1:18:23] Badasti: Kreygasm
[1:18:23] Ambersulfr: and if he wasn’t he’d be dead
[1:18:31] Thunder4o: Ascendance-after buff kinda better,but still cd that exposes you hard positioning wise
[1:18:38] Rhensz: big meatballs
[1:18:55] belvedee: Kappa
[1:19:00] Thunder4o: Spiritwalkers aura mastery-countered by a single cc,you lose whole aura mastery value of it
[1:19:01] rwrbrickzy: we needa double earthen action
[1:19:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Burrow was a good addition, imo
[1:19:19] yesterday_potato: rhsam will be in awc
[1:19:21] middlebeach: I play rsham in solo shuffle too. we have a lot of damage and insane passive aoe heals
[1:19:25] nargonisttv: I just started playing a healer for the first time about a week ago, and chose Rshaman, and I am really loving it.
[1:19:27] Sosatko: @Thunder4o lol
[1:19:27] pvalue01: they just need to update earthen animation and maybe tweak some of Rsham's CDs a bit. Rsham has the worst CDs among any healer and this is true in PvE as well
[1:19:30] Thunder4o: NS-the only good cd,added currentsly,but is good only if you use 2-3 gcds before that
[1:19:54] pvalue01: link should have way more HP
[1:20:03] Thunder4o: Healing tide-joke of a cd,killed in 2 hits,you cant get more than 2-3 ticks out of it,most people use it for the additional healing on target buff
[1:20:09] yesterday_potato: Earthen locks your allies in it like static lol would be funny
[1:20:14] Ambersulfr: link should be guaranteed to tick before it dies
[1:20:18] Ambersulfr: idc how they do it
[1:20:27] middlebeach: "If we like it or not"??? Lmfao
[1:20:31] Thunder4o: Earthen-the worst of them all,static totem that makes you stand on a position
[1:20:32] kreyzy8: surely they won't run out of it pepeLaugh
[1:20:41] middlebeach: If we make it
[1:20:43] pvalue01: playing rhsam at moderately high mmr is turbo frustrating. people STILL dont stand in earthen and all your other totems are just 1 shot insta
[1:20:45] Thunder4o: tell me then that Rsham doesnt need hard rework
[1:21:15] worldhealer: it doesn't LUL
[1:21:16] Sosatko: @Thunder4o p obvious a shaman main kekw
[1:21:27] kreyzy8: I think if earthen wasn't visually the most dogshit ability in the game people may actually stand in it
[1:21:31] Thunder4o: Yes and i spit facts
[1:21:37] finnybae: dragon age was a great game
[1:21:38] Luckydutch90: Try playing rsham at 1800 when everyone runs out of earthen INSTANTLY even when you ping it but the dps do focus kick on CD. It’s the absolute worst rating bracket
[1:21:45] skepperr: one shat
[1:21:47] middlebeach: Dh Darkness is, priest bubble thingy, dk amz. Earthen has many brothers and sisters that are meta
[1:21:57] kreyzy8: there is way too much screen clutter in retail for most people to see earthen
[1:22:13] jeevel: true
[1:22:39] Thunder4o: Also i forgot,Shaman cant use wall when stunned,dont have any external either
[1:22:43] Knaitx: they should make earthen totem the size ofa war banner
[1:22:44] Ronn_Deezy: DPS should have to solve a captcha test when the leave earthen Kappa
[1:22:54] Rhensz: @middlebeach only one of those abilities are super hard to see, guess which
[1:23:00] Thunder4o: Grounding totem-easily killed by every caster with off gcd spell and still can kick you on heal
[1:23:24] pvalue01: all they really need to do to Rsham is update teh earthen animation and give totems (especially link) a bit more health. 3min cds shouldnt be 1 shot lol
[1:23:24] Sosatko: @Thunder4o how do the Rsham mains in rank 1 range make it work then crazy if its that unplayable
[1:23:35] Ambersulfr: here it comes
[1:23:40] Ambersulfr: grip right out of the earthen
[1:23:53] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy xzeve WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:24:09] pvalue01: also it's so funny how treants are fundamentally the same ability as healing stream totem but 100x stronger (off gcd, more healing, more hp, lower cd, more charges)
[1:24:14] Ambersulfr: if that dh didn’t have adhd you’d have been dead lmfao
[1:24:15] Thunder4o: @Sosatko Rsham works only in normal 3s bracket with good team on voice and exact comps that support Rsham
[1:24:24] Luckydutch90: Remove living tide and buff healing tide baseline in PvP. Then give rsham a PvP talent that makes earthen attach to a player.
[1:24:29] xzeve: xzeve subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 😀
[1:25:19] Ambersulfr: happens
[1:25:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was close
[1:25:33] chrye_xx: another day another time for me to complain about DHs
[1:25:35] ItsBees: !prime
[1:25:35] Moobot: @ItsBees rukiP Hey do you guys know about Twitch Prime? If you or someone you know has Amazon Prime, you can link it to your twitch account and sub to your favorite streamer (Venruki) for free!!! rukiP More info here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[1:25:50] willivanlit: @Luckydutch90 not a bad take
[1:26:42] vodkacran: @Luckydutch90 they could do something similar to dh's where they have a talent where totems go to players the way dh sigils go to enemys
[1:26:44] Bixster: warrior life

[1:27:27] kreyzy8: oh I thought you meant at the end
[1:27:31] Ambersulfr: you don’t need to save your best defensive for later when the enemy team pops every offensive ability
[1:27:40] korbz_fgc: ven what u use to target ur teammates ?
[1:27:48] Ambersulfr: idk where this dps mentality came from, but it’s terrible
[1:28:17] Spaceberry_McDuck: the dps mentality has gotten worse. i was pumping 130k hps yesterday and was told i wasnt healing enough, lol
[1:28:38] ayalcoh1: ven lets see some outlaw games :X
[1:28:43] nikthevoker: i wonder how Bdk/aug/fister 3s would go LUL
[1:28:56] Ambersulfr: yeah, it’s true
[1:29:06] tv_raz: amount of people who dont trade
[1:29:34] KralHor: isnt f1 etc kinda far for how often u have to switch target?
[1:29:45] tv_raz: they dont space out t hey tunnel
[1:29:49] darklights15: Venruki, we need you to host a retail mak'gora tournament :)
[1:29:54] zachgamegodx: the snow ball effect

[1:30:17] stealthwalker99: That hpal was dead  next sheet go, he tricked/bubbled + darkness first go
[1:30:48] nargonisttv: My least favorite thing about my Rshaman and solo shuffles is everyone runs out of my walls
[1:30:53] nargonisttv: Every single time.
[1:30:58] darklights15: hell ya
[1:31:05] darklights15: would be different

[1:32:53] mikehul: i need 4 set then lol
[1:32:59] nikthevoker: DO IT

[1:34:59] Lleo00: ppl meta gaming the fuck out of sod is what killed it for me
[1:35:03] kkubby: its cause you are smart ven
[1:35:04] Lleo00: acting elitest at lvl 25
[1:35:06] betasoldier: I'm not. All my friends play it, but I'm just not into it. Feel bad about it because they're all into it, but just eh.
[1:35:06] Ambersulfr: it’s just another version of classic
[1:35:07] slaughthemage: ur not alone venruki
[1:35:13] belvedee: its not for me either. i did enjoy watching people do the new raid when it first came out.
[1:35:18] tarth_100: nah, not excited for SoD at all
[1:35:18] Ambersulfr: and people took it way too seriously
[1:35:21] dramajohns: not much content to be honest, that's the negative thing for me.
[1:35:29] zachgamegodx: ever thought u guys might just not be skilled enough for SoD?
[1:35:37] Ambersulfr: what I really miss about the OG game is being able to play without the insane min maxing
[1:35:38] Enterthenoob: wow needs to sort the queues - only game these days I like playing but I spend too much time wasted in queues so probably going to stop playing for a while
[1:35:42] Ambersulfr: we’re never going to get that back
[1:35:48] StromicusRex: i'm glad my guild is super chill in sod. we clear twice a week and our comp didn't even have a priest until last night
[1:35:49] vodkacran: starsurge hitting me for 70% of my health bar is def a skill issue on my end
[1:36:01] danieljjohnsonn: any destro locks here wanna give some advice on how to push past 1700-1800, everytime I get thereI end up just beinf trained tanked back to 1600’s 🙃
[1:36:04] pvalue01: min maxing is a product of the times, not the game
[1:36:05] Juarrior: hows evoker dps? its fun?
[1:36:07] danieljjohnsonn: in solo*
[1:36:28] Sosatko: it presswes 2 buttons

[2:07:45] healhut: big judge for 29k SeemsGood
[2:07:47] jxygodx: lierally the only reason theyre viable rn

[2:23:03] zachgamegodx: heal drinking
[2:23:05] zachgamegodx: opop
[2:23:09] samiyam: yeah it should take you out of stealth
[2:23:10] abhorath: Thoughts on removing dampening and replacing it with a growing damage/healing increase?
[2:23:14] sourbutts: do you think we will see any spriest/frost mage in AWC?
[2:23:15] samiyam: or water should be limited in arena
[2:23:16] swolecolemole: agree 100%
[2:23:17] samiyam: i think that could be cool
[2:23:29] zachgamegodx: 5 bottles
[2:23:30] AlrightokayAO: as a night elf player, stealth drinking is all that we have
[2:23:35] SharmaJenkins: only allow mages drinks Pog
[2:23:38] mccarley253: what yall think the best caster is rn
[2:23:45] Icetomeetyu: I play shadow/arcane ;)
[2:23:50] DoYouWannaHug: Can't meld shadow bolt or any other cc or anything
[2:23:54] Badasti: night elves are not a poor indie race
[2:23:56] carrvve: do you like the dampening system or think they should try something else
[2:24:00] Salanzo: ive lost many games to that racial
[2:24:17] samiyam: how do we fix arcane mages ven
[2:24:26] gelatokush: only 0.00001% of player can effectively dodge cc with meld Kappa
[2:24:27] sourbutts: im hoping for some good balancing changes after AWC
[2:24:36] betasoldier: think we will see devokers in the AWC?
[2:24:49] Disparage: @venruki how would you feel if Alter Time CD was 1 Minute 30 Second CD however it couldn't be dispelled, and being able to Alter Back even while kicked.
[2:24:52] sourbutts: not vs anything that can purge tho
[2:24:56] KuriV1: outlaw has been an immortal god for how many xpacs now 2-3?
[2:25:07] ten_fold: alter time can be purged though
[2:25:07] healhut: how about spellsteal?
[2:25:14] slaughthemage: i just want deep freeze for fire
[2:25:15] absterge: alter time in mop = super cool spell u can use offensively/defensively, alter time now = dampener immortal spell u just press for fun and 95% of classes can't do anything about it
[2:25:20] mccarley253: do you think blizz looks at nerfing more in PVE than PVP?
[2:25:22] taylorperiod: sterge!!
[2:25:25] Icetomeetyu: Just hit 2.1 on my sp wasnt even the dmg buffs it was the armor + health buffs that did the trick
[2:25:26] samiyam: man alter time in mop was so much fun
[2:25:30] samiyam: sadge
[2:25:33] zachgamegodx: spell steal is brogen
[2:25:37] sourbutts: @absterge play blood elf
[2:25:40] Dirkdigglier: What is the problem with spell steal?
[2:25:42] SharmaJenkins: wasnt it even stronger tho
[2:25:43] vmills: wait what does pb do for healers??
[2:25:58] absterge: spellsteal spam with arcane has to be the most broken iteration of purge up there with legion electrocute and BM hunter tranq spam in wod
[2:25:58] gelatokush: u just put cd on it
[2:26:02] trikkSP: doesnt help that spellsteal is literally in the rotation
[2:26:02] obtusedoorknob: u gotta be able to choose between making it a spammable purge or a spellsteal with cd
[2:26:05] Snypes_SYCO: What if they nerfed the duration of alter, but made it on purgeable?
[2:26:05] Dirkdigglier: Could they give it a 15 second cd with like 3 stacks or something?
[2:26:12] Snypes_SYCO: non*
[2:26:15] zachgamegodx: its not more dmg to spell steal right, it's just instead of spamming non empowered missles?
[2:26:18] tommiiguns: Cyclone needs to break on damage
[2:26:22] sourbutts: @absterge what about the previous iteration of spellsteal where it did a 5% heal lol
[2:26:34] trikkSP: put a cd on it
[2:26:52] Sindorii: what i dont remember alter time in mop what did it do?
[2:26:54] sourbutts: how are we not talking about DH still being the most broken and easy to play class in the game
[2:26:58] roughknuckle: CD on cyclone is a terrible idea
[2:27:04] trikkSP: cast time on spellsteal LUL
[2:27:05] roughknuckle: they just need to redo druid trees
[2:27:07] zachgamegodx: typhoon dont break
[2:27:16] VetisBR: https://x.com/lofibanshee/status/1751625887013900706?s=46&t=lNoT4V0nj-B35et_CChp0A
[2:27:17] zachgamegodx: but neither does fear anymore
[2:27:18] zachgamegodx: KEKW
[2:27:20] Dimistarr: dreamwalk has a cd
[2:27:27] rise4q8: they should put cd on sheep
[2:27:29] absterge: think CD is bad gameplay, they would probably have to just buff the mana cost? but instead of 5 purges to oom its like 12? not sure, idk how much arcane regen is that's up to ppl like venruki to decide!!!
[2:27:30] sourbutts: DH doesnt have a natural hard counter and its a real problem, its basically retpocalypse all over again
[2:27:31] absterge: VENRUKIIII
[2:27:36] swolecolemole: oh dang im bout to be in your shuffle /pray
[2:27:37] Axtin: what if they made arcane have only klepto but it was baseline
[2:27:45] mccarley253: 3s cd on sheep maybe
[2:27:48] pragma90: what do you think of removing pvp talents, and adding new talent trees that are pvp specific and pve specific, where if you enter pvp content you swap to pvp tree. that way you dont have to balance between the two
[2:27:50] Dimistarr: a spammable unbreakable cc seems off
[2:28:00] AlrightokayAO: @absterge I'm so glad that Venruki is in charge of balancing
[2:28:04] absterge: yeah I know you'd have to change that somehow with purge
[2:28:05] absterge: it's a lot of mechanics
[2:28:07] malvarcla: Absterge. legendary smoke god.
[2:28:09] absterge: they would just get insta procs
[2:28:24] Disparage: reduce the chance for a clearcast
[2:28:24] sourbutts: 1 spellsteal = 1 clearcasting IM IN
[2:28:41] grifnballs: do solo shuffle arena maps swap each week?
[2:28:43] zachgamegodx: would a 0 mana spell steal for arcane be worse for them to press then
[2:28:50] Dirkdigglier: What about a ramping mana cost? 5 second debuff that doubles the last mana cost?
[2:28:50] Axtin: what if they made spellsteal cost 2% hp per press
[2:28:59] neek320: maybe give spellsteal charges instead?
[2:29:05] absterge: yeah good idea @Axtin every spellsteal costs 15% of ur health
[2:29:06] absterge: this is good
[2:29:17] kasieus: then you just make clearcast proc off damaging spells and slightly buff missles if it needs compensation
[2:29:17] trikkSP: spellsteal doesnt regenerate procs
[2:29:19] sourbutts: just give yourself a decaying 7% dmg buff after spellsteal
[2:29:20] mccarley253: maybe 5 %
[2:29:20] trikkSP: KEKW
[2:29:26] sourbutts: debufff***
[2:29:35] sourbutts: for like 10 seconds
[2:29:39] Disparage: increase the cost of spell steal and no longer allow it grant clear casting
[2:29:41] kreyzy8: what if spellsteal puts a stacking slow debuff on you to counter out all the other movement buffs LUL
[2:29:54] kreyzy8: so if they spam spellsteal they are moving at 30% movement speed
[2:29:55] trikkSP: the target gets a spellsteal debuff? idk
[2:29:55] mccarley253: cant spellsteal same target for said time
[2:29:58] absterge: I think they need to nerf arcane and outlaw and sub and buff SP and assa and marks hunt and resto sham
[2:29:59] sourbutts: its the issue of the arcane mage is building damage, aswell as denying buffs thats the issue with spellsteal
[2:30:08] trikkSP: @absterge unbiased ofc
[2:30:17] healhut: @absterge SeemsGood
[2:30:18] Sindorii: seqKEK @absterge
[2:30:27] vmills: 1st ss in instant 2nd .5 sec cast 3rd 1 sec cast
[2:30:37] ChunliWW: they need to make fear to where its nondispellable
[2:30:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: marksmanship hunter can bring heat, I don't know that it needs buffed
[2:30:42] mccarley253: i miss the old hunter shots
[2:30:42] amdownzintel: I'd like to see what happens if you put all CC on the same DR. CC lasts longer, but then you are immune from all CC for X duration. Should help the "I just want to play" aspect
[2:30:45] ChunliWW: it already doesnt break on dmg
[2:30:46] rwrbrickzy: i just think they should make que times instant
[2:30:47] absterge: yes @ChunliWW
[2:30:48] slaughthemage: want mage to have deep freeze for fire again to see some fire mage spriest gameplay
[2:30:49] absterge: sleep walk too
[2:30:49] kreyzy8: @absterge load up the tweets!
[2:30:57] Roundhere_: screw warlocks
[2:31:01] absterge: why can u dispel a sleep? how can u just wake someone up with a dispel
[2:31:05] Zerker77: swweeet emooooootion
[2:31:05] Fatalimit: buff unstable affliction dispel protection
[2:31:06] wow_revan: @venruki Were you invited to comment on AWC?

[2:32:09] Zerker77: fine give more armor then
[2:32:12] Fatalimit: i don't think they should be able to blink mid poly cast
[2:32:18] AlrightokayAO: honestly just let mages blink any CC
[2:32:23] bransby09: Remove devoker having basically infinite spirit walk
[2:32:24] kreyzy8: KEKW

[2:32:52] carrvve: cringe
[2:32:54] Disparage: @absterge what did old vanish do differently
[2:32:54] absterge: they need to bring back stormlash totem
[2:32:57] trikkSP: i love grip, fun ability
[2:32:58] carrvve: cringe lobby
[2:33:06] Axtin: bring back evanesce Kappa
[2:33:11] trikkSP: bring back sp spectral guise
[2:33:11] Badasti: @beep101boop a blinkophobe if you will
[2:33:18] absterge: they need to bring back OG displacer beast for druid where you just had a vanish/blink
[2:33:23] absterge: u had a literal blink/vanish
[2:33:23] AlrightokayAO: Evanescence is a great band
[2:33:24] Disparage: bring back MOP second wind
[2:33:46] trikkSP: there has been alot of shit through the years LOL
[2:33:49] pragma90: bring back orb botting for mw
[2:34:02] healhut: @Badasti Kappa

[2:34:39] ayesoh195: what was that skill in WoD where priest went invis for a few seconds? bring that back too
[2:34:46] mccarley253: mage movement op
[2:34:48] trikkSP: @ayesoh195 spectral guise
[2:34:50] Dragoresh: funny watching him get yoinked every 5 seconds in each direction
[2:35:17] Zerker77: change hunter matchup I’ll be happy with mage
[2:35:32] nixxor: you are making me play an arcane mage now
[2:35:32] mccarley253: is shimmer still a blink
[2:35:33] AlrightokayAO: @Zerker77 yeah bring back dead zone for hunter
[2:35:34] Axtin: freest ww lobby
[2:37:31] Disparage: think this is a free blood dk lobby
[2:37:45] Zerker77: I can’t wait for traders new item
[2:38:44] llseattlell: venruki did you know windwalker is the real cheat code in pvp
[2:39:27] mayonaes: WW is the cheat code below 1800
[2:39:37] mayonaes: after that you have to actually use brain power
[2:39:52] B0ost3d: Hey chat when does AWC start
[2:39:55] llseattlell: 157k dps openers is insane

[2:43:29] macielmpr: @AlrightokayAO i'm new player bro, sorry for this
[2:43:34] comfyslayer: Them numbahs Tony, i swear, they're off the friggin charts!
[2:43:34] madoxstudios: I love the arcane battery AM's
[2:43:58] mccarley253: melt
[2:44:00] AlrightokayAO: @macielmpr just play what you like and enjoy the game
[2:44:03] mayonaes: ARcane has it easy in arena, either they chase you forever and you do damage or they leave you alone and you do even more damage
[2:44:07] trikkSP: has the pally lost one?
[2:44:07] FlynnFluff: hey ven as a mage what weak auras do you use?
[2:44:07] swolecolemole: dks def needed that nerf
[2:44:08] aarongarey1993: I didn't know dks fell over so easy

[2:44:51] EvanGGxx: Probably that they have the mage so it's gg kek
[2:45:48] duridino: this game looks so different from the one i play
[2:46:18] mccarley253: UI setup @duridino
[2:46:19] nesqalope: Average pve lobby
[2:46:36] thisisthotcaller: rip harokz
[2:46:45] bonaphil: how long do you think the eu section of awc is going this weekend?
[2:46:48] trikkSP: harokz struggeling
[2:46:50] VAINSx: grenade guy
[2:47:03] duridino: they called u nub
[2:47:09] Smoochii: he’s going to die
[2:47:09] healhut: portuguese
[2:47:11] turkeybaster9: "This is an elite mage"
[2:47:16] daculmd: they said "down he goes"
[2:47:21] VAINSx: he says "i want to die"
[2:47:21] Smoochii: you are a great mage
[2:47:23] trikkSP: "down goes"
[2:47:31] VAINSx: hes speaking portuguese
[2:47:33] kreyzy8: KEKW 󠀀
[2:47:35] nesqalope: XD
[2:47:43] atoker: portuguese, the brazilians can't really watch twitch so they aren't enlightened like us
[2:47:46] Roxxybolts: I think he said nerf ret
[2:47:48] itemrestoration_butirl: ima need that code for ur UI ven
[2:47:54] swolecolemole: you guys carried me on the W's ngl
[2:47:54] kreyzy8: the other DK did 11 mil more damage
[2:47:59] healhut: one dk was doing about 25% more dam than the other lol
[2:48:15] swolecolemole: vispioh, i was just playing dot build
[2:48:22] dakila24: a lobby without a resto druid and resto sham feels so nice as mage
[2:49:02] kreyzy8: disgusting
[2:49:03] zachgamegodx: or u just proc literal bloodlust...
[2:49:06] Axtin: what is tempo
[2:49:12] nesqalope: Big up mr venruki i like your content
[2:49:13] zachgamegodx: with take your cut from the outlaw rogue ur robbign the bank with
[2:49:19] kreyzy8: we're approaching BFA S4 haste
[2:49:45] zlovett08: no we're not. i have like 100% base haste in bfa
[2:49:48] drfloppsi: Tempo is German = Haste ^^
[2:50:05] drfloppsi: yes
[2:50:12] madoxstudios: italian
[2:50:13] KeasyKey: keeping time
[2:50:14] madoxstudios: origins
[2:50:27] boomergodxx: tempo means pace generally in english
[2:50:27] mezemos: tempo has some kind of rhythm in the connotation in english ithink
[2:50:28] 3KuLTV: are ferals in a good place rn?
[2:50:29] VAINSx: tempo in portuguese is like time in english
[2:50:42] duridino: tempo is italian means tissue
[2:50:44] magonyth: geschwindigkeit is in german. tempo italian. pleasee  xD
[2:51:11] linkzy_gaming: tempo = timing in music  Tempo= keeping a rythm or pace with speed
[2:51:19] aarongarey1993: Have you played ele if so did you enjoy it?
[2:51:20] drfloppsi: Go grandma

[2:51:39] Drpzor: healer medals too
[2:51:42] Drpzor: LUL
[2:51:43] trikkSP: @venruki Have you tried rbg recently? i tried it first time since mop a few days ago, was pretty fun
[2:51:46] JustTaki: there's the little healer conq items
[2:51:48] betasoldier: i send the healer medals to my alts

[2:52:10] skarny1: just do viewer rbgs its good conquest ez gear
[2:52:21] kreyzy8: haste is kind of an intangible stat
[2:52:23] kreyzy8: yeah exactly
[2:52:25] Drpzor: I'm playing full mastery marksman, I'm enjoying the 3 second sniper shot hardcasts LUL
[2:52:31] yab_xd: gcd reduction
[2:52:39] madoxstudios: less than 40% haste for arcane/frost can really throw off gameplay optimization
[2:52:41] yab_xd: nothing feels as good as it
[2:52:58] reavethederp: 4Head it all makes sense
[2:53:07] magonyth: it make sence
[2:53:30] magonyth: tell us more please
[2:53:32] thisisthotcaller: sounds like when chun was telling people to delete TSV and stop thinking so much, and just put everything into haste vers lol
[2:53:42] duridino: how do you kick casters with lots of haste? do you pre kick?
[2:53:51] mayonaes: EZ luck
[2:53:58] OliveCat50: Hello, I'm new.
[2:54:01] llseattlell: what rating is babooshka
[2:54:05] zachgamegodx: I think u did irrepairable dmg to babooshka
[2:54:13] Axtin: u gotta recraft that fatty mastery ring
[2:54:33] Roxxybolts: babooooshka
[2:54:44] madoxstudios: W/ the armor buff to cloth anything above 40% haste I just add to crit or mastery if my Vers is over 30% unbuffed.
[2:54:47] reavethederp: change loot spec
[2:54:54] GORDACK311: it does that on my shadow priest all crit gear
[2:54:55] mayonaes: scammed
[2:54:55] healhut: thats all i get too is crit gear lol
[2:54:59] Roxxybolts: streamer loot pog
[2:55:00] Tpyoeror: Tpyoeror gifted a Tier 1 sub to OliveCat50! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[2:55:15] betasoldier: could do mastery fire SS's/arenas so to grind the conquest?
[2:55:31] KeasyKey: LOVE the mog!
[2:55:45] galdinator: babooshka has to be the most gangsta wizard
[2:55:51] healhut: @Tpyoeror @OliveCat50 HeyGuys
[2:55:55] OliveCat50: Thank you Tpyoeror
[2:55:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: 5K EZ
[2:56:01] madoxstudios: just hook @venruki up
[2:56:04] atoker: 5 mettle is worth 5k
[2:56:07] madoxstudios: don't be that goblin
[2:56:15] Cdenzy: Same
[2:56:21] OliveCat50: Hi beep101boop
[2:56:23] zachgamegodx: when ppl say "send it" it's amazing instead of that WALL OF TEXT
[2:56:25] magonyth: me too
[2:56:26] zachgamegodx: advertising their shop
[2:56:36] reavethederp: sometimes i dont tip when they say that
[2:56:43] warbux2: Same same
[2:56:45] reavethederp: hehe
[2:56:50] reavethederp: true
[2:56:53] Geowind: did you mail over pvp gear to an alt I thought it was soubound
[2:56:59] hippie_tv: @venruki whats the best way to get bloody tokens ?
[2:57:00] SteLawBro: You should never set tthe price on a service as a consumer.
[2:57:07] Extramediums: my pet peeve is when people say "5k 'tip'" and then that's a fee, not a tip
[2:57:08] SteLawBro: Dealers job
[2:57:21] madoxstudios: tips are earned, not required. If someone said "i'll do it for 1k" i'll give 10k.   If someone says do it for 5k, I shop elsewhere
[2:57:24] zachgamegodx: why is it so much harder to finda recraft for some items than it is to just get a new one crafted
[2:57:26] amdownzintel: I just tipped 1k yesterday. people doing 5k?
[2:57:28] zachgamegodx: if sparks were infinite id never do recrafts
[2:57:54] Spaceberry_McDuck: i think all the people complaining about crafters having fees dont craft
[2:58:07] atoker: recrafts are 5k if they use their mettle
[2:58:15] ar1dqt: I tho7ught haste was soft capped at 40% so once you get your barrage stacks youre good at like 35% @venruki
[2:58:36] ar1dqt: im offended
[2:58:40] atoker: ven is right about soft caps
[2:58:43] mccarley253: a tauren warlock?
[2:58:46] Crucaider: Softcapped in the since that there's going to be DR on the stat, but that's it
[2:58:49] Extramediums: you just get diminishing returns beyond that, so it's always useful.
[2:58:57] zachgamegodx: they dont care about stat dr in pve they only care about the sim
[2:58:58] aframpp: yep
[2:59:00] ar1dqt: ohhhh okay
[2:59:02] taylorperiod: yuh
[2:59:04] comfyslayer: ye
[2:59:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Diminishing returns increase as a stat goes up but it can still be worth to go high with one
[2:59:05] atoker: ven always lands rings so we can trust him
[2:59:11] Lleo00: grimtotem rp
[2:59:12] ar1dqt: can maybe someone explain DR on stats? doesnt click in my brain
[2:59:15] Badasti: not bad, i got blue and green versions of the totomogs
[2:59:24] slaughthemage: that is giga dope that mog
[2:59:29] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy warbux2 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:59:30] NASAdesigner: lol agree! its 10% off anything ABOVE the "cap" so if cap is 30, and you have 40, you really have 39.... worth!
[2:59:40] zachgamegodx: pvpers are more concerned with teh stat caps bc crit is nerfed and vers has intrisnsic value so mastery haste vers often close
[2:59:59] metajutsu: @ar1dqt after reaching a certain value, each additional haste point degrades in how much its worth
[3:00:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: A number of melee peeps are running vers in the high 30's right now
[3:00:28] groundhojday: you can't just say "diminishing returns" in a vaccuum though, it's the context that matters.  yes, you might get 1 additional or 1 less dot tick at a certain haste "breakpoint" but that shit is not as meaningful in pvp as just getting the cast off in general
[3:00:38] Noobsiqt: rofl
[3:00:40] Noobsiqt: TRUE
[3:00:42] aframpp: clip it
[3:00:42] healhut: @ar1dqt most stats like haste have "diminishing returns" above 30%. It takes more haste rating to go from 30% to 31% than from 29% to 30%
[3:00:45] Noobsiqt: BIG TRUE
[3:00:48] mccarley253: lock did 30% the dmg
[3:00:51] mccarley253: 40% maybe
[3:01:11] ar1dqt: yeah crafted
[3:01:21] Roxxybolts: watch your mouth @mccarley253 put some respeck on the beef

[3:06:43] Badasti: people think they have options, so they are always looking for something better, so in reality they have nothing
[3:06:43] niki_lauda312: I got married at 19 and now im 29, just 9 days to our 10th anniversary, trust me its the best decision i ever made in my life

[3:08:25] magonyth: 49 xD
[3:08:27] Extramediums: people can get married when both parties want within reason, others don't. I've been with my partner for 10 years, and we don't plan to get married or have children ever
[3:08:31] plae007: But then again.. Military xD (still going strong goin on 9 years married, 13 years together)

[3:11:40] Extramediums: @Extramediums both my partner and I have health issues that we would never want to pass on to another being, we live in an area that's it's insanely expensive and nonviable for us to afford everything, and neither of us would ever want to bring a being into existence in to the world in its current state :( . So very early on in our relationship we discussed all these things to make sure we're on the same page

[5:08:52] BetterknownasJohn: true i suppose, but those magical triple sweep go's make it all worth it for me
[5:08:59] srslol: playing a monk made it very eye-opening how people know how to control it and made it that much easier to exploit on my main
[5:09:01] NETRAV3R: yea
[5:09:07] whspe: you get the sirens going off on serenity and all eyes are on you haha
[5:09:15] Jengul: All healer should play like Rdruid and not nerf rdruid. Afk healing allowing to play offensive
[5:09:25] BetterknownasJohn: totally
[5:09:25] ChunliWW: ww gotta be the most miserable spec to play in the game rn
[5:09:26] heymomimonttv: triple leg sweep go on ww is just as good as triple shockwave lol
[5:09:29] ChunliWW: doesnt mean its bad
[5:09:43] srslol: the highs for ww definitely don't outweigh the lows lol
[5:09:50] srslol: idk tho it pumps
[5:09:55] Secretwombatbro: only alt ive shelved till its fun to play
[5:10:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I thought affliction was the most miserable spec to play??
[5:10:17] Secretwombatbro: winning is almost as frustrating as losing
[5:10:20] michxxlh: aff is top 2 for sure
[5:10:35] rekt1370: LUL
[5:10:47] LoDrakK: Best pvp wow expansion?
[5:10:59] ChunliWW: yeah just feels like the other team fucked up unless its actually a good matchup
[5:11:04] comfyslayer: yep
[5:11:11] The__Swordmaster: WW is my favorite spec but I understand what you guys mean
[5:11:13] FoxisFitness: multih8LUL multih8LUL multih8LUL multih8LUL multih8LUL  DF hahahahahaa
[5:11:17] shugguls: even when I lose on war I still want to play it

[5:11:24] comfyslayer: people are gonna regret not playing it
[5:11:31] FoxisFitness: Lowest Participation of PvP Ever DF
[5:11:33] rekt1370: other than rogues and ret it would have been good
[5:11:37] ChunliWW: yeah i played war in mop and wod
[5:11:39] Alerothan: Season 1 of dragonflight was better maybe
[5:11:51] BetterknownasJohn: mop warrior Kreygasm
[5:11:57] comfyslayer: all classes are fun rn imho
[5:11:57] Polyrhythmz: wars def fun
[5:12:02] Grimey_George: stergeFried stergeFried
[5:12:03] rekt1370: mop when they had op second wind right
[5:12:15] LoDrakK: Mop pvp was legit
[5:12:16] fantasiesgx: 3s feel so dead. I've spent more time in LFG (as a healer) above 2.1k than I have playing and its not even close.
[5:12:23] The__Swordmaster: My favorite thing about MoP was Tigerseye Brew
[5:12:34] The__Swordmaster: and old SEF
[5:12:34] rekt1370: feel like mop and cata had the best pvp
[5:12:49] AtomJar: @fantasiesgx doesnt mean its not good for pvp, solo shuffle has been big for pvp
[5:13:24] Badasti: I feel like people romanticise mop, and I had a great time in mop. But I also remember peoples feelings towards burst of speed, and homogenisation, and priests having a low cd vanish etc LUL
[5:13:31] fantasiesgx: @AtomJar solo shuffle is dogshit to heal, you cant convince me anyone like healing in 50% damp andd going 3-3 most games
[5:13:32] rekt1370: high mmr
[5:13:51] AtomJar: @fantasiesgx dont need to convince you....
[5:14:22] michxxlh: cata was so bad
[5:14:25] atoker: @fantasiesgx just do 3s ... shuffle is for the riff raff
[5:14:26] LoDrakK: Mop classic pls
[5:14:36] fantasiesgx: @atoker you didnt see my first message
[5:14:47] rekt1370: i go on my sp i deal with 3 kicks 40 stuns 10 micro cc to cast one spell while they press w and hit 2 buttons LUL
[5:15:14] atoker: @fantasiesgx you can't expect the dps that don't get games in to be at your level
[5:15:25] boomkin_exploit: @rekt1370 thats why i asked about ww vs war
[5:16:26] AtomJar: also solo rated BG's look to be fun as well
[5:16:39] The__Swordmaster: People definitely romanticize MoP but it was still great, however people complained about CC and button bloat and it led to the first Great Prune of abilities in WoD
[5:16:42] fantasiesgx: @atoker I feel like I can expect to be able to play the game...
[5:16:42] DveevD: why u gnome?
[5:16:44] Kymagez: want to go there
[5:16:48] BetterknownasJohn: people forget how insane some of the stuff in mop was. still the most fun i've had in pvp
[5:16:51] The__Swordmaster: I hated The Great Prune
[5:16:53] comfyslayer: and cute af!!!
[5:17:01] comfyslayer: snare removal big!
[5:17:04] 777delayed: gnomes are sick as fuck gnomasayin? @venruki

[5:17:10] crawnpocktail: ankle smashers
[5:17:12] atoker: no pruning plz... even shaman doesn't need pruning
[5:17:12] Badasti: @AtomJar I actually dont like the solo rated bg's at all... the mounted speed etc completely ruins it for me
[5:17:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: vulpera enters the chat
[5:17:29] atoker: I still have more binds I can use
[5:17:34] shugguls: get out of roots , best racial especially with the root buffs
[5:17:44] BossmanRitz: its not nice to lie
[5:17:47] LoDrakK: Bring back charge stun
[5:17:54] pragma90: calling rets weasels now.. ven really hates rets
[5:18:01] AtomJar: @Badasti i mean thats fair. i like options. some times i want to arena and others i want to BG. having an easy way to do both has been amazing for me
[5:18:04] crawnpocktail: they need to replace arcane torrent and make belf usable again
[5:18:11] crawnpocktail: or whatever its called
[5:18:12] b1scui1ts: EZ
[5:18:19] boomkin_exploit: i heard a queue pop
[5:18:29] Badasti: @AtomJar yeah I feel you, I'd have loved it if they didnt modify the move speed etc. I just wanted a solo que version of rbg's
[5:18:35] atoker: @KKPkMn I agree and make the blanket silence activate pre cog
[5:19:05] mrxilio: precog was fun addition to the gmae
[5:19:22] sourbutts: @mrxilio it made casters playable yeah
[5:19:26] crawnpocktail: @atoker honestly i think they should just give them shadowmeld too if nelf are gonna keep it
[5:19:31] YesitsSuper: YesitsSuper subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! rukiLove rukiLove rukiLove
[5:19:37] Badasti: man conquest comes in ridiculously slow in shuffles
[5:19:47] AtomJar: @Badasti personally im glad they dropped the amount of players but i would have prefered them to make new custom maps for solo RBG's with smaller group numbers
[5:20:23] Alerothan: @Badasti Just gotta spam games on a healer lmao
[5:20:35] AtomJar: @AtomJar tho maybe after 1000's of BG's im just keen for anything new
[5:20:38] crawnpocktail: @Alerothan good for the game imho!
[5:21:04] Badasti: yeah, new maps would be cool, but I feel like the majority ofthe new maps they have brought in over the last few expansions suck XD
[5:21:14] Badasti: i think they need more dedicated pvp teams to make stuff that feels fun to paly
[5:21:27] MazzMos: which specs are suffering right now?
[5:21:35] Badasti: @Alerothan hey now, I did my time today, there's only so much my poor heart can take
[5:21:51] BetterknownasJohn: ya love to see it
[5:22:01] crawnpocktail: @MazzMos enhance ig
[5:22:10] AtomJar: i really dont like that it feels like instead of having like 5 different capture the flag maps (for variaty) it seems like they want to make a new mode for every new map.
[5:22:13] atoker: how is he so high in greens?
[5:22:24] agren13: I like his attitude
[5:22:29] shugguls: lol
[5:22:30] atoker: oh yeah
[5:22:55] Alerothan: Honor gear needs to be more competitive. How is it fun that youre just going to que and 0-6 almost every game until you get more gear
[5:22:58] americanmoses18: can we agree mmr shud just reset in between ssns so we dont have to 0cr 2300mmr lobbies? lol
[5:23:07] Badasti: @AtomJar thats true
[5:23:42] atoker: @Alerothan you gotta farm boxes on your main, and new players are kinda screwed
[5:24:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Poor guy just starting out as a healer, could  be, yeah

[5:26:29] The__Swordmaster: When you play WW, I start levitating in my chair
[5:26:29] mzaamentor: i rerolled ww from warrior lol
[5:26:38] Enme4: he meant to type MW monk, we wanna see you heal
[5:26:45] davidlols_: for a second I thought this was eye of the storm LUL
[5:26:48] crawnpocktail: @slaughthemage devastation if you like one shotting people
[5:26:54] AdamHeron12: i can never seem to get an average lobby as WW. im either going 0-6 or 6-0
[5:27:12] mzaamentor: i dislike the bleed centric warrior gameplay nowadays
[5:27:24] rodrepe: I've just watched your video. I don't really care about the AOTC mount becuase I won't use anyways. But if Rhok'Delar or Benediction come to trader thing I'd be pissed. I completely kills the value of anything.
[5:27:25] crawnpocktail: i suck so bad at WW, just never clicks for me
[5:27:47] mzaamentor: i’m hardstuck 1900 on my ww currently but still learning

[5:28:11] BetterknownasJohn: is is 2h or duel weild these days?
[5:28:14] Juancki: When did WW stop being one of ur favorite? Or like when do you feel ww started going the wrong way?
[5:28:39] not_jsn: when serenity became a must
[5:28:51] crawnpocktail: yeah serenity is boring
[5:28:53] trentbail23: better then frost dk
[5:29:03] crawnpocktail: i also hate warrior because of the auto bladestorm thing
[5:29:08] BetterknownasJohn: It's destiny
[5:29:25] kjjuu: been waiting 28mins for my que and you get insta feelsbadman
[5:29:26] mzaamentor: ya warrior bladestorm avatar is boring to me
[5:29:27] Mesmerized9879: WW relies only on dps, so if we're not top tier it's hard :/
[5:29:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Garbage mage, pog

[5:31:11] crawnpocktail: i dont understand the reasoning behind not being able to cancel
[5:31:33] DrWarz: monk is ten times better than warrior
[5:31:38] DrWarz: actually does dmg

[5:35:15] vodkacran: @KKPkMn is it? they have a lot of dmg if they can connect but very susceptible to roots/slows
[5:35:36] mzaamentor: Should I stop playing monk and replay my survival/warrior? lmfao
[5:35:50] Reiumi_: monkaW
[5:35:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: whaaaaat
[5:35:57] The__Swordmaster: Oh god NOT LIKE THIS
[5:36:05] The__Swordmaster: ☠️
[5:36:05] crawnpocktail: @vodkacran i think most people would agree that monk is better than warrior but yeah, they both suffer from that
[5:36:28] duridino: !
[5:36:29] symptomV: @KKPkMn  vers mas
[5:36:29] BetterknownasJohn: ww life
[5:36:38] reallydruid: how come your monk isn’t Venruchi
[5:36:47] crawnpocktail: @symptomV thats why i said im having a bad time mate
[5:37:00] crawnpocktail: BibleThump
[5:37:01] Badasti: ok eu is completely dead. I've queued into the same annoying destruction lock 4 shuffles in a row now, this is beyond stupid
[5:37:01] symptomV: sadge
[5:37:04] trentbail23: theres just too many stuns.
[5:37:34] vodkacran: @KKPkMn burst certainly higher on WW but they have 1 stun on a long cd, warrior can at least blade storm roots BUT definitely a hard comparison. just my thoughts
[5:37:57] vodkacran: also intervene etc much more utility
[5:38:29] vodkacran: feels like on ww sometimes i just see my teammate dying and I'm like "welp literally can't help you at all"
[5:38:31] mzaamentor: dude dhs have way too much
[5:38:36] BetterknownasJohn: Shouldn't at all

[5:39:24] mzaamentor: i personally can’t stand dhs and rogues currently
[5:39:39] mzaamentor: rdruid output is ridic too
[5:39:57] crawnpocktail: @vodkacran yeah i get that, they definitely feel stronger in an organised team though
[5:39:57] ryanblue98: seems like not much uptime
[5:40:08] crawnpocktail: so maybe WW in SS isnt the thing
[5:40:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: The piglet polymorph is nice
