[4:04:38] Sollice: The only way you can seem to get 30 series card is if you build an entire PC
[4:04:50] TheFuriyon: took me 1 month to get my 3080
[4:04:55] Treason824: yeah i cant find a ps5 myself

[4:05:05] Zettabyte: towBeer *
[4:05:21] Bulgogiprince: Taiwan Semi can't make enough processors for anything at the moment
[4:05:21] Dewbz: It's overpriced of course.
[4:05:23] azzurrin: I've had a eVGA 3090 FTW3 Ultra for over a month just sitting on my desk, because I can't find ryzen 5000 series CPUs or any pc component LMAO
[4:05:24] Phae__: Yeah, boss mount
[4:05:25] Phae__: lower left
[4:05:39] Phae__: Yes, you have to get the item and do the questline
[4:05:42] Phae__: like blanchy
[4:05:44] Skaboy_TV: You have a chance to get the drop that you have to grow to a mount.
[4:05:51] KingSlayerYotam: you have a chance from the rare to get the item, than do quests for 7 days
[4:06:08] Sollice: Newegg is doing some thing now where you can enter a lottery
[4:06:12] Thadune: hard out here for a pimp
[4:06:14] BuDDeRNuttS: i sold my 2070 super for the same price i pad for my 3080
[4:06:17] Masqerader: at this rate gonna have to buy a prebuilt pc and take the cards from that LOL
[4:06:19] Nemesis_: i got a 5800x on launch day, my 3080 is still on backorder from september KEKWlaugh
[4:06:21] Mecabeast: quest for mount is a rare drop from gorger
[4:06:28] azzurrin: Same as mine. ALso, there are lines every morning for people trying to snag a 3080 and 3090
[4:06:32] SirMattiii: 2070S vs. 3070?
[4:06:33] BrutalBlueberry: Did we already do the anima conductor boss?
[4:06:44] Sollice: Well they were posting twitter posts when they were getting them in stock and bots and scalpers were insta poaching
[4:06:51] TheUnknowing: terrible time to build a pc I guess, speaking of pc's have you guys heard of Origin PC? I heard they have 3000 series cards Kappa
[4:06:53] bezer: newegg is also jacking up the price once you win that lottery also
[4:06:55] Mecabeast: also to get 20 series and up your better buying brebuilts right now just for the card
[4:07:14] Sollice: So now this way they tell you the lot of things they get. You sign up for what you want to buy and hope you get lucky. Doesn't avoid scalpers but I guess it ggives everyone a more fair shot
[4:07:16] ZeethianDragon: It's really sad
[4:07:30] Sollice: uh og
[4:07:36] SirMattiii: 2070 Super vs 3070?

[4:17:07] BrutalBlueberry: Homeland?
[4:17:13] GermanBacon: Designated Survivor is gooood
[4:17:14] Sollice: @Towelliee Did you watch Jack RYan season 2
[4:17:16] Zibbp: Homeland is great
[4:17:19] InFall: You should watch SEAL Team
[4:17:21] Sollice: I didnt think it was that great Season 2
[4:17:21] Frenaris: West Wing is pretty good
[4:17:22] Jarlan23: you ever watch 24 @Towelliee ?
[4:17:25] wilZifer: The first three seasons are really good
[4:17:26] Masqerader: Jack Ryan?
[4:17:31] warrenny: @brutalblueberry That was good
[4:17:33] wilZifer: The whole series is good though Homeland is a go
[4:17:37] CrispyZenn: first 4-5 seasons of homeland are incredible
[4:17:38] SnakeDoc919: The Unit is REALLY good. Lot of seasons there too. Its an older show.
[4:17:38] Jarlan23: fucking loved 24
[4:17:42] manmower: designated survivor wasnt as good
[4:17:42] ExtreemeCheese: holy Jack Bauer
[4:17:45] Todmeister9000: MoP music? you miss MoP @Towelliee ?
[4:17:46] Jarlan23: i even owned the 24 board game.
[4:17:52] XtraPartz: Check out Newsroom
[4:17:54] hildobagins: did you watch the last kingdom?
[4:17:58] GermanBacon: please dont...
[4:18:00] Thadune: @Towelliee Garafolo
[4:18:07] SnakeDoc919: Yea if you liked 24 and Shooter, you'd love The Unit. It's about Delta.
[4:18:11] warrenny: Cant wait for the star disney plus rewatch 24

[4:18:18] dimofodi: Carson is a great QB imo, bad year with bad coaching
[4:18:23] kokochris: @Jarlan23 if someone stops on the wrong spot. do you get to electrify their nads ?
[4:18:31] CrispyZenn: thats bc he cant move?
[4:18:31] Sollice: lol
[4:18:33] Holysal: some of it bc he holds the ball so long
[4:18:33] GermanBacon: AngelThump still hoping for a miracle in Lucks return AngelThump
[4:18:36] feherlofia123: have u seen the movie " phone booth " , same actor as 24
[4:18:37] Sollice: Spent more time on his back than on his feet
[4:18:45] NetherRegion: if you watched him, he made TERRIBLE decisions.
[4:18:49] dimofodi: @Laxsis LOL he can move, his OLINE is TRASH
[4:18:52] kovex: An they just expected him to be able to perfrom. Meanwhile they are just trying to replace him the whole time
[4:18:56] NetherRegion: it wasnt all the oline and coaching
[4:19:02] Jarlan23: @kokochris it was a trivia game basically about 24 show
[4:19:11] Sollice: Having a shitty oline doesnt help, but with 40 sacks man you have to question if he is trying to hold on to the ball too long and force shit
[4:19:13] kokochris: @Jarlan23 ah man, not the same...
[4:19:17] Jarlan23: @kokochris your idea sounds more fun tho
[4:19:18] aironet: Wentz has a big issue with holding the ball too long though. Something he needs to fix.
[4:19:19] Todmeister9000: who's gonna win the super bowl?
[4:19:54] dimofodi: @Sollice oh absolutely, he never threw it away, his receivers never got open, his oline couldnt protect him, AND he made bad decisions to hold the ball instead of throw it away
[4:19:55] Masqerader: i wouldn't trade for that contract
[4:19:57] Masqerader: too much money
[4:20:00] NetherRegion: HAHAH yea right
[4:20:07] lumaday: one first round pick for a starting QB seems like a good deal
[4:20:09] Sollice: He is no way a first round trade
[4:20:30] ne0rmatrix: Just realized i feel very depressed this am :( Happens every winter but i was hoping it would skip this year.

[4:21:40] ne0rmatrix: ty @MekChopperDiaries it is a seasonal thing
[4:21:41] Thadune: 2nd for Hopkins
[4:21:42] Sollice: 1st round picks for 3 years at least and some players
[4:21:44] Jarlan23: trading for watson isnt worth. not only would he take up cap space but he would cripple the development of your team for 4 years

[4:22:18] Masqerader: Given what Lions got for Stafford lol, Deshaun might cost like half ownership in the team
[4:22:18] Sollice: @alcoholicpolarbear lol

[4:24:16] Archiee: He's got us though :) We'll help him fly through that shit
[4:24:20] Todmeister9000: he could buy a boost tho
[4:24:28] 40locos: he can 0-60 boost tho
[4:24:44] Masqerader: But he doesn't have the stress of raid leading which will be a nice break for him
[4:24:46] RedEffinghawk: sloot rerolled on NA?
[4:24:54] Sollice: Normal and Heroic plate feed runs
[4:24:55] MJadeS99: imagine if he couldn't boost to 60

[4:42:10] Mallaes: Ah coxChicken

[4:42:28] TheUnknowing: if they announce an expac today ill probably resub to FF to catch up on stuff, im behind a bit on MSQ but not much
[4:42:39] langiqc: So when are we going to get those covenant allied races boyz ? :)
[4:43:01] Agito_Akihito: i'm probably resubbing to XIV closer to 6.0 release
[4:43:03] Mallaes: ResidentSleeper
[4:43:04] PurplePyrex: i got a Strength leech trinket from one the Burnblister rares at 194
[4:43:05] toobaked1987: @Towelliee do you know anyone that has gotten lucky with Bubbleblood? I am over 50 kills now.

[4:43:57] idenkaz_: shit on islands all you want folks but they had tmogs mounts ect KEW
[4:43:59] Roffasauras: I like FF14, but I can never get to max level because I'm always playing alone
[4:44:00] idenkaz_: KEKW
[4:44:01] Agito_Akihito: FF's story's great the first time around
[4:44:04] Reap14: @feherlofia123 You are welcome to your opinon man.
[4:44:08] GermanBacon: @Towelliee have you seen that the NoPixel(GTA 5 RP) community most likely has a deal with Universal Music for licensing their stuff to stream on twitch?

[4:44:13] h_u_r_k_: LUL
[4:44:15] Vigi9413: I tried getting into FF14, but all i could think about is playing wow
[4:44:19] Lumimyrsky: Yeag Final Fantasy isn't for everyone.
[4:44:20] Agito_Akihito: FF's not alt friendly at all. especially since you just need 1 character really
[4:44:21] hoyhoy007: but the story gets better and better
[4:44:22] Dylan19_93: its always kinda cool though
[4:44:29] Reap14: Its a jrpg. They are focused on story.
[4:44:39] Velashen: Shadowbringers starts a little slow to be fair.
[4:44:45] Reap14: No it doesn't
[4:44:58] Bacon_21: good thing you can pay to skip LUL
[4:45:00] mrniceguy817: My favorite towel clip ever was of his hearthstone during fallen avatar progress
[4:45:01] PretentiousCat: I think if the area you're talking about is the same for me I ended up skipping in that zone
[4:45:06] langiqc: Same, I feel like every other mmorpg I play dosen't feel right... and then I think about WoW
[4:45:07] Throdio: ESO is my secondary mmo
[4:45:07] Koravd: @Reap14 Its not a jrpg its an MMORPG lol
[4:45:08] h_u_r_k_: have you played FF7 remake?
[4:45:10] Reap14: The only way it would be slow is if you didn't have context by skipping previous content.
[4:45:14] feherlofia123: ff14 is a melodramatic story. not my thing . ill watch people stream it
[4:45:25] Reap14: @kevaly Hence why I said it is unique
[4:45:38] Reap14: It doesn't stay within the lines of established mmos
[4:45:42] Pannekaker: WoW just *feels* better than everything else imo
[4:45:52] PretentiousCat: The new 48 man raid is bonkers
[4:46:01] Okeywan: in
[4:46:07] Koravd: @Reap14 Its unique by being story driven but you calling it a genre which is not
[4:46:16] CADZtv: yep
[4:46:19] hoyhoy007: what about the ff14 community compared to wow?
[4:46:26] Rulem: the most fun I ever had raiding was Wildstar first raid; the first boss was even awesome
[4:46:31] Reap14: It has a story better than most jrpgs @kevaly ..you can call it whatever you want
[4:46:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: i do enjoy red mage in ff14 but i skipped the last expansion will probably play through when its on sale and i get a free week from square
[4:46:46] hoyhoy007: very true
[4:46:49] feherlofia123: waiting in anticipation for ashes of creation
[4:46:55] Sollice: @Towelliee Giveaway is over
[4:46:56] Khalio23: The thing that puts me off about ff14 is not the game but the community. They cant take any critism about their game and are almost fanatic about the game
[4:46:59] idenkaz_: ff and wow playersbase are night and day.
[4:47:04] Koravd: @Reap14 There are many games that have better stories than jrpgs.. that doesnt make it a jrpg lol..
[4:47:09] Wildside1177: Oh hiow is the Beer that was aged in the EC 12 casks?
[4:47:09] feherlofia123: @khalio23 yes

[5:01:49] Jarlan23: what about almond milk
[5:01:52] Silence667: yea but you'd need to eat so many you'd be dead before the poison did anything
[5:01:53] Sollice: Cyanide?
[5:01:56] cobrauskis: One can kill you if you choke on it
[5:02:06] Brodih_: @craigb1992 sumG
[5:02:10] toobaked1987: Most almonds produced today are naturally tasty and safe to eat. Back then, though, many were bitter and poisonous. Even today, consuming 50 ‚Äî or fewer ‚Äî wild, bitter almonds could potentially kill an adult, and just a handful contain enough cyanide to be lethal to a child.
[5:02:10] warrenny: @cobrauskis Or allergic
[5:02:14] TheUnknowing: tbh I don't even like almonds so thats fine
[5:02:29] talic420: ya you can eat raw almonds they have to be cooked
