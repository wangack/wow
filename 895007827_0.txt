[3:46:39] cheersfordoobies: tobad i already did the ladder of torghast before it came out lol
[3:46:39] Frustrated_Nerd: I think if you go for the right powers I find Guardian is stronger than Prot pally.
[3:46:48] TheGiant99: Its just a boring chore now
[3:46:58] Mecabeast: dk is get crown + concoction + robes as one combo
[3:46:59] Anguyen92ab: Attempting Layer 8 of Torghast has ruined my enjoyment of it.
[3:47:00] alextheory_: they can make it better for sure thop
[3:47:04] HoffaFiles: work work
[3:47:05] Anguyen92ab: Twisting Corridor
[3:47:06] abbosss: guardian is insane in torghast if you get multiple barkskin duration inc. plus the thorns
[3:47:09] riftplaya4ever: Thank You for all the wow stream brotha keep on going man.

[3:47:57] Cheniac: Choregast is just ass
[3:47:58] Frustrated_Nerd: Thorns + Barkskin + root proc and rootwood, then all the moonfire ones
[3:48:04] Anguyen92ab: The soul ash reward is all right. Twisting Corridors Layer 8. The mount is just not worth the two hour grind.
[3:48:07] TheGiant99: Once you get rank 3 lego there is zero reason to do it
[3:48:12] Jarlan23: it just gets repetitive. you get the same spells every single run and it feels like a chore
[3:48:14] Cheniac: but i am happy they made it better for alts
[3:48:29] abbosss: @Jarlan23 i mean thats literally not true
[3:48:29] Jarlan23: like every run feels the exact same
[3:48:36] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[3:48:40] D3m0nHunt3r666: :D
[3:48:42] abbosss: you can get good anima powers or bad anima powers?
[3:48:45] thelimitlesstv: @Towelliee just got my Peach Ring and Blue Ice Gfuel today, both of them, good shit...
[3:48:46] Cheniac: It is a chore. Blizzard always has atleast one chore each expansion.
[3:48:49] Jarlan23: @abbosss it is though. at least for warriors.
[3:49:03] abbosss: @Jarlan23 fair enough, im presuming form my own class
[3:49:09] abbosss: from*
[3:49:20] abbosss: i dont get why people hate torghast so much
[3:49:24] Masqerader: Masqerader subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[3:49:25] Jarlan23: like for warriors you ge t the throat pipes one and the execute one every run and your fine
[3:49:31] Masqerader: it's also pretty good exp for alts
[3:49:34] Jarlan23: the anima powers arent varied or interestign enough
[3:50:22] abbosss: i like how theres a chance you DONT get your BiS powers
[3:50:26] abbosss: that makes it fun
[3:50:35] AmongsttheMist: let’s trade me for you
[3:50:40] abbosss: imo
[3:51:17] Jarlan23: like they should triple the amount of powers available and give you like 4 choices on orbs when u complete a floor
[3:51:31] Jarlan23: so you could make wild combos. instead its like 100% dmg on one ability
[3:51:57] abbosss: fun detected
[3:52:03] PadidinJones: I HAVE THE POWAAAAA
[3:52:15] denflup: hope they have some plans for torghast for 9.1 dood
[3:52:23] Ishva: i agree with Terry its all about being OP haha
[3:52:26] WingTsunNW: Why not just give the option to learn other class abilities and make your own class
[3:52:29] Jarlan23: like the only bladestorm power you get in torghast incrases the diuration of it
[3:52:36] abbosss: @WingTsunNW 5Head idea
[3:52:54] Jarlan23: instead they coulda make it so when you bladestorm your movement speed goes up by 400% and you shoot fireballs while doing it
[3:53:35] D3m0nHunt3r666: leaderboard kek
[3:53:41] idenkaz_: Torghast is fkn dead.
[3:53:42] ItsToxicQT: @WingTsunNW theirs a private server that does that
[3:53:43] Anguyen92ab: Another good idea. Just needed a good finisher.
[3:53:53] Anguyen92ab: But fell short, typical Blizzard.
[3:54:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: Give some gear drops in that shit and it might come back to life
[3:54:11] Doohzyy: literally havent ran it since i got rank 4 legendary like week 4
[3:54:35] Koraccc: did you use your orb?
[3:54:40] Masqerader: im doing it each week for ash, cause u know rank 4 will become rank 5 eventually
[3:54:41] Frustrated_Nerd: to get out of that slow, just shapshift
