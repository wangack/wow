[5:53:04] khitomer: @sodapoppin  "In World of Warcraft Classic, particularly for a Warrior tank with a Fury/Protection (Fury/Prot) build, the argument for having a slow weapon in the off-hand with a fast main-hand typically revolves around maximizing threat generation and rage efficiency. A slow off-hand weapon tends to generate more Rage per hit due to higher damage output on hits, which is crucial for a tank's ability to use abilities more frequently and maintain aggro."
