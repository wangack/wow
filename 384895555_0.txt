[3:43:45] acaran_: @peradd if they started in damp, healers would have to use more mana to heal so quicker game, they would have to use defensive cooldowns quicker, and the games would be actually fun. What is happening right now is that everyone is trading perfectly for everything so defensive cooldowns nevere run out. If they start in damp defensive cooldowns would run out.

Never mind the fact that people have 200k+ HP and very rarely if ever do some specs, and only some specs do more than 50k of dmg in a single bl–æw, not even a 4th of one's hp. But hey, maybe if we n–µrf m–∞na reg–µn by 100% next patch, that would fix it? 4Head

[6:15:49] DexterStJock: @CelphJA I don't think they've gotten lazy. They did put in a lot of effort into the artwork, quest interaction, world building. They did prune classes too much, I'll give you that. And gear you basically get through the mail, so to speak, don't like that. But I still like WoW, and when the time comes when I don't, I'll just move on. :)

[7:12:56] optimuspottery: yes, next expansion WILL Be worse. i only play because i love the game. but i dont love what it has become.
[7:13:01] h2oD: Let's be honest with ourselves. All of us are mad that WoW is still the only MMORPG out there that we want to play. And we don't want to play it. We want the WoW Killer, and half of us don't want to come to terms with the fact that there will never be a WoW killer, and we'll never get that magical feeling back. It's gone. We lived it. It was unique.
[7:13:03] Gordon__brown: @Fyrex why? in any game thats online you want the world to be filled, servers only existed because cloud computing didnt exist in the same way (i.e. old tech) when wow was released
[7:13:04] Bigdan2140: Man i forgot how Pepega the Warcraft chat can be wow

[7:13:27] gloomPK: @Gordon__brown do I need to repeat myself? the servers WERE filled.
[7:13:28] bariumjones: @alpsiri11 im literally not complaining tho, just saying you're wrong to assume that everyone who thinks bfa is lackluster thought "every expansion was worse than the last one", its simply not true. i thought mop was better than cata, tbc better than vanilla, legion better than wod
