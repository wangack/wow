[2:54:48] ChadOrc: @x_Scy there are not 15 classes in the game
[2:54:50] Grim_F4nd4ng0: Not really possible to do it without duplicating the inputs tho, so whether directly bannable or not, its basicallyt the same difference
[2:55:07] real_dodo_: lemiikeDAWGS lemiikeBEAR lemiikeDAWGS lemiikeBEAR lemiikeDAWGS lemiikeBEAR lemiikeDAWGS
[2:55:13] x_Scy: @ChadOrc there's 37 total specs in the game, which is what you would go for.

[3:04:13] Sebleh: Tettles hair brightens my day. if I have sad day, i just watch Tettles hair. when Tettles has a good day, so do I. I love Tettles hair and I hope it keeps standing so we can all have good day. GIGACAT
[3:04:15] Goliathse: @siborg1 If it was Echo they would had talked to Admin first. Thats the difference. Like last weeks gigabrain.
[3:04:18] Sinaa: Relax, Admins expect 1400 rio strats
[3:04:20] raemkiyoshi: Mandatory didn't pay enough to pass the approval stage.

[3:05:39] moderatygos: i don' tknow what the strat was, but its possible mandatory's strat could have been approved if they had asked in advance, but they didn't, so the rule applied that they forfeit the map
[3:05:44] gilsongb: what happened
[3:05:45] jacksully0401: @Sebleh fair enough

[3:06:20] sacrilege_69: what was illegal? am confused whut happened there?
[3:06:22] jacksully0401: @sweetlina_ it is just a clever use of game mechanics
[3:06:23] vibbe1: go ahead, take a map off echo, i dare you hahahahahah what a joke
[3:06:23] malven33: It's like gingi on his stream after PF boar snapping, I'm not sure if the team asked the administrators, I don't know
[3:06:24] gilsongb: what happened
[3:06:27] StiwiDK: what happened to dht ?
[3:06:30] Eloris_: Wait, I didn't analyse the graph enough. Put it back, please.
[3:06:32] AlpineIron: @Cyberz_ Mandatory stepped on the wrong pixel
[3:06:33] LexiSaberX: I'm sure Ion would of been cool with it Kappa
[3:06:39] yahitsjay: @sacrilege_69 they did something illegal
[3:06:40] TVPadres: they pulled trash through the wall on first boss
[3:06:42] TheGreatChibix: Communication 100 from Blizzard Kappa

[3:06:49] Sinaa: if Sloth wins the series, I'm calling the cops
[3:06:53] sweetlina_: @jacksully0401 @jacksully0401 whatever mandatory did was also clever use of game mechanics
[3:06:53] UsedRuggs: @malven33 didn't Blizz give them the win though, rather than actually holding them accountable?
[3:06:59] spirit098: kekw blizzard wont let u expose their bugs
[3:07:00] bloodthirst_90: how does it work with these gifts for exp points?
[3:07:01] Gaz_Games_: @Vocnys it's not that the strat wasn't approved, Mandatory didn't tell Blizz about it, that was the issue, it may well have been approved if they'd asked
[3:07:04] gaamontwitch: steal is the right word
[3:07:09] caputo233: @GingiTV goat

[3:07:23] kurakeisarij: Damn i like this dungeon, one of the better ones blizz made
[3:07:28] hunterzx: What strat? we understnd that *something* must be preapproved
[3:07:29] Goliathse: @sinaa Can you record that if that happen
[3:07:32] moderatygos: the issue is that strats have to be pre-approved. if they are not, then the rules state they can forfeit the map
[3:07:34] Petrosdk87: why they took the win back? plz answer
[3:07:41] spinecrap: honestly they should've forfeited echo's PF win long time ago
[3:07:41] lordbeedril: @gaz_games_ I think the point is they shouldn’t have had to
[3:07:42] bergsbygd: wait what happend that sloth got the win

[3:08:04] miniRoach: how can you win a dungeon you didn't even finish?
[3:08:06] StiwiDK: what they bugged?
[3:08:17] OrderlyChaos17: f
[3:08:17] falysae: @TFTCurse They usd a strategy that was not pre-approved
[3:08:18] boochacho: is mandatory going to get a time out?
[3:08:20] moderatygos: During that match Mandatory used a strategy that was not pre-approved by Admins ahead of the run and therefore their run was nullified. That awards Sloth the win in Match 2 and therefore we're going to Game 3.
[3:08:23] monkwww: Xddd
[3:08:25] scawdk: @moderatygos This is not answering what part of their run was close enough to break the rules that blizz said "you should've asked"

[3:08:54] MissMountainGoat: what was the strat?
[3:08:55] bullgod_1876: There is a rule, they know its a rule, they broke the rule (probably by accident) enforcement means they forfeit the game - it happens
[3:08:57] Isarees: what strategy did they use?
[3:09:01] moderatygos: i'm just passing along what the admin provided. i do not know what the strat was specifically, sorry

[3:09:22] Moobot: Keep up with highlights during MDI on the Raider.IO coverage page: https://rio.gg/MDIDF3Coverage
[3:09:22] Gaz_Games_: @lordbeedril why? it's Blizz's competition rules that you disclose all of your strats to blizz, if you don't that's against the rules to try to avoid explots/unfair advantages
[3:09:22] spirit098: @ArnesMeyer ??
[3:09:28] syko_totem: Seems like we won't get to know it. At that level they should be aware of the rules
[3:09:31] xxnightxravenxx: Oh snap
[3:09:31] AndyG1128: Ok so Mandatory did something unexpected and didn't clear it with the admins first since it wasn't a "normal strat. It would probably have been approved if they would have gotten approval but because they didn't it's a DQ. THat's what I'm understanding
[3:09:33] PrincessPuffyPants: @pepekekwx Streamed unclothed
[3:09:34] scawdk: @Kirutasu This clarifies nothing lol
[3:09:38] adamantium_bear: Maybe  it was the subjugate demon bit
[3:09:40] Goliathse: They stepped on a critter and got DQd
[3:09:43] moderatygos: @AndyG1128 essentially, yes
[3:09:51] lotttee: Are you planning to expand to pve? :think:
[3:09:56] moderatygos: i can't say for sure if it would have been approved, but the issue is they didn't ask first
[3:10:00] ArnesMeyer: PowerUpL !!! MANDATORY !!! PowerUpR
[3:10:02] draykevel: sloth shame spain
[3:10:03] erikwso321: @AndyG1128 thanks for clearing that up
[3:10:06] lockeedinn: what happened in DHT?
[3:10:07] jacksully0401: I guess if they had the strategy pre-approved woudl not have been a problem
[3:10:08] 60iqtwitchemployee: My tanks always do unexpected things in keys aswell, why are they not getting punished :)
[3:10:08] pepekekwx: what did they do?
[3:10:09] SustagemGame: So far, makes no sense this 3rd round
[3:10:13] Cyphixoxo: Mandatory got got for speeding :(
[3:10:16] boochacho: i thought it was tettle's hair that cause the disqualification

[3:10:38] 701sm: @scawdk it clarifies a lot. maybe not what you wanted/needed, but a lot nonetheless
[3:10:38] Nuclear_Toxinz: I'd rather see a rerun of the dungeon than a forfeit tbh
[3:10:39] RudeDinosaur: what was the strat the DQ them? it wasnt noticed by anyoine else in the match itself
[3:10:39] knowitallpokemonmaster: :O
[3:10:48] HeySpacecamp: @boochacho He got his hair pre-approved
[3:10:51] hunterzx: @malven33 They will submit everything remotely cheesy or techy, through their competitor discords. Everything.
[3:10:59] heyitsferris: During the +23 DHT, Mandatory pulled mobs located in the hallway after the first boss through the wall during the Archdruid Glaidalis encounter using a method that was not approved by administration prior to the start of the match. As a result, they have forfeited the map and Sloth has been awarded the win.
[3:11:00] Luk777ls: @malven33 omg so you are jsut an echo hater
[3:11:01] TwistyBro: Twin pi Pog
[3:11:05] SustagemGame: Being good at the game is bad now folks
[3:11:06] ModeraYsera: Mandatory used a strategy that was not pre-approved by Admins ahead of the run and therefore their run was nullified. That awards Sloth the win in Match 2 and therefore we're going to Game 3.

[3:49:24] Sathyron: BRH is by far the most boring map to watch
[3:49:33] xGriefxGodx: @Sleepypan I've watched many matches and I always see a veng dh, a spriest, a mage, usually a resto druid. Let's not pretend like there's a wide variety of difference in any of these teams. My question is why?
[3:49:33] DCBen: what happended to tettles hair? dawg

[3:51:04] Cacsito: @welsh_newbloodgaming Coz it's a speedrun competition, and you can't speedrun those key levels
[3:51:06] picc0: @welsh_newbloodgaming cause 30's + are for TGP
[3:51:09] Sleepypan: @welsh_newbloodgaming because its a speed race competition... there is a seperate competition for higher keys 󠀀
[3:51:13] brothadawkness: @welsh_newbloodgaming mdi is for speed the great push is difficulty

[3:52:31] bullgod_1876: WW would be used if it were a melee meta - this year its a caster meta
