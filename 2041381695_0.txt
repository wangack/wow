[0:46:51] mironp: Honest question if this was proven why are they not banned?? I'd think Germany will have law about this
[0:46:52] packedx: Oysters taste like shit
[0:47:03] Dirkdutchman: @abugintherug its because of a rise in populism, a large majority is not educated well and easily influenced by a loud populist
[0:47:08] gshep__: Because other parties refuse to address the problems that they address i.e. immigration. Not saying it's right, it's a contributing factor.
[0:47:18] Mogol109: whaat? this isnt hoi4 ???
[0:47:37] PhasedKitten: NA and to think I’m the American in here who supposed to the the armchair politicians
[0:47:38] 5un_and_m00n: @knossius I know ! if you try to ban they switch into WerteUnion. You need to challenge the AfD in political matters. the stupid extremists will always be there
[0:47:40] Thewanderingplayer: @CuPitv Because this is his stream and he is always right :)
[0:47:44] malinous147: dont forget tv
[0:47:48] unicronboi: if you never address the reasons/policies why a party like afd becomes 20+% they will only grow - that's how democracy works. address voter concerns and the party goes
