[5:45:23] ChixoHernandes: Can someone explain what war mode is?
[5:45:43] Kottasha: @chixohrndz it's a mode where pvp is enabled
[5:45:43] TPBaron: enables pvp and gives some extra bonuses for quest rewards etc
[5:45:44] EliteFourJosh: War mode = PVP mode. Having it on means you consent to people on the opposite faction fighting you. @chixohrndz
[5:46:00] JustKigzy: so whats new with WoW? haven't played since Cata
[5:46:01] mattyhe123: wait jakes actually streaming in my timezone lol, why is he up so late
[5:46:09] TPBaron: it also phases you from those who are not in warmode
[5:46:14] Kottasha: @chixohrndz there used to be pvp and pve realms, now every realm has war mode so if you dont wanna pvp you can turn it off, if you want pvp you can enable it and you get some rewards for it
[5:46:15] EliteFourJosh: I have a 22 horde hunter jnbWell
