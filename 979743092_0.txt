[0:19:06] jiffynuts: I don’t remember which class I played the most. Probably sorc and Amazon
[0:19:29] Cyclodia: Frozen orb in 1.01 classic, such uberness
[0:19:30] PrisheBurningBlade: I hope the D2 Remake does a balance pass tho, some great builds need just a lil bit of love, to be competative with the OP stuff

[1:20:48] Darthyrevan: what was the length on the youtube contract?
[1:21:07] Mike__Ro: that August of 2000 my brother came in with 2 copies of Diablo 2 it was one of my happiest days ever. i was 19 years old daym
[1:21:47] Shrandamar: I would love if m+ was about pushing difficulty rather than time.  Getting too old for timers :P
[1:21:55] Noshpan: I ended up buying my ex his copy of Lord of Destruction because he forgot his ID
[1:22:01] 3663Sharad: IIRC, they sad two years
[1:22:02] dante4147: stupid question, did you train?
[1:22:06] Mike__Ro: @big_dummy_thicc indeed!
[1:22:13] mmrghost7: compare the prize pool of m+ to dota champion ship , it's a joke

[1:22:35] itjustfeelsright: here in Ontario were back into stay at home orders :(
[1:22:37] rosina_scarlett: Looking at raider io it's alot of CN/KR teams that are pushing the really high keys
[1:22:52] LehBiscuit: LUL

[1:22:56] MrEvilRex: Hi Towelliee how is it going
[1:22:58] dante4147: :D

[1:23:21] mewkittymon: Under city
[1:23:26] ANONlMAS: gz on 60
[1:23:44] ricoNajt: think they need to ask their leader
[1:23:48] mmrghost7: CUZ prize pool is low
[1:23:58] disctrasaneu: !room
[1:23:58] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:24:02] mmrghost7: when u put 20k no one cares about it
[1:24:05] KingsandClubs: Agree
[1:24:11] mmrghost7: it attract no one
[1:24:15] Triist0ne: bobby has a hard time to let go of the dollars
[1:24:19] Shrandamar: Blizzard got too greedy and took most of the crowdfunding themselves
[1:24:21] Gorestack: no one cares about it anyway lol, its garbage e-sport @mmrghost7
[1:24:28] Malkyr: Dont you think people would call Blizzard shitty for crowdfunding as a huge multimillion dollar company?
[1:24:36] mmrghost7: excatly
[1:24:42] rosina_scarlett: The tournament will be broadcast live on YouTube and Twitch so the great push will be on twitch and there is nothing saying the CN'KR teams can't join
[1:24:46] templarofboingo: Backed prize pools legitimate the business model
[1:24:52] RocketMan23: that doesnt mean the viewers will show up though
[1:24:54] vibesham: Thats how life is in general & publicity
[1:25:00] vibesham: Everyone follows the money
[1:25:13] RocketMan23: if the MDI isnt interesting to watch the prize pool doesnt matter
[1:25:28] Pannekaker: Just having a larger prize pool isn't magically gonna attract a lot of people to watch a WoW esports. COD, DOTA and all of those are much more accessible to all the "normal" people
[1:25:30] luckfore: they dont wanna spend money
[1:25:41] Mortal_Wombat_: why would I care how much some other dude get's paid. i don't get it
[1:25:46] rosina_scarlett: going to be fun to see this great push tourney though
[1:25:48] templarofboingo: No one watched HOTS that had a million dollar prize pool
[1:26:32] ElPolloBatman: blizzard sc2 worked really well with dreamhack, esl and mlg
[1:26:35] fxih2o: !diablo
[1:26:35] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing the Early Access Diablo II Remastered Alpha today towPog
[1:26:50] RocketMan23: ya but sometimes the product isnt interesting to watch, and the MDI is not very interesting to watch
[1:27:00] Malarick: thats true everywhere need to spend it to make it
[1:27:17] Xenrawr: But how else are you gonna afford Bobby's bonus?
[1:27:23] Kinghorn: ^
[1:27:26] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, Which is also why just having a large prize pool won't magically fix the esport
[1:27:41] rosina_scarlett: Bobby kodicks bonus could go towards the prize pools imo
[1:27:43] ricoNajt: they could also get that money back sooooo fast
[1:28:02] Malkyr: The reason I never watch MDI anymore is I dont find wall to wall pulls fun. If they actually had to think up great strats and stuff it might be cool. I havent watched in a while so maybe it is better now
[1:28:07] Narendia: what happends to his room? where is all the light and stuff?
[1:28:20] ricoNajt: if they charged each participating player $3 as a signup fee, they'd get that $100k back without a doubt
[1:28:25] RocketMan23: the MDI is way too long going across too many weekends, after the first week the viewership tanks
[1:28:37] kaeltalas90: !room
[1:28:37] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:28:41] CurlyFriass: watchin massive pulls gets old lol we get it, you can aoe LUL
[1:28:51] Narendia: ah thx
[1:28:51] Shrandamar: I forget the MDI exists because it's on youtube, it's so hard to find livestreams over there
[1:29:11] Arkiel_: KEKW
[1:29:15] Dankatar: !diablo
[1:29:15] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing the Early Access Diablo II Remastered Alpha today towPog
[1:29:21] Arkiel_: nice for cardio
[1:29:24] MoobJuices: fast runs are cool and all but I'd rather see them do big high keys.
[1:29:25] jak_gaming: PVP will never be bigger than PVE in WoW
[1:29:34] RocketMan23: this new Big Push sounds way more interesting then the timed runs for the MDI
[1:29:57] Pannekaker: @Moobjuices, Well do I have good news for you! KappaPride
[1:30:07] Arkiel_: prize pool low and not enough incentive
[1:30:22] mewkittymon: You cold go to East plate as well for hurbs
[1:30:28] luckfore: so why is blizzard not investing in Wow esports?
[1:30:39] Arkiel_: cuz they are blizz

[1:31:25] DrSoosh: wow too imba to go big in esports
[1:31:25] rosina_scarlett: @alchemicgoat Sc2 wasn't
[1:31:27] vforsvendetta: Scaring away some of the best players isn't exactly helping their business. It's insane how little return there is for winning MDI vs the time needed to invest in it to actually win.
[1:31:31] dimofodi: JdotB posted about how they watch a 15 minute screen saying "We'll be back" instead of ads
[1:31:34] mmrghost7: rebull

[1:34:21] Thoreya: arena imo has so much potential for sponsors
[1:34:22] MarquisLek: didn't they already do that
[1:34:27] Gorestack: they've been failing with e-sports for 10 years, dont expect much to change
[1:34:30] Pannekaker: @Malkyr, Oh, that was last summer LOL I was confused when you said a couple years ago
[1:34:30] SonofHorus82: Morning Towel! Morning chat peeps!

[1:54:21] Justarandomman: @WhiteKnight74648 few more good years left in you then lol
[1:54:32] WashedGamerMoment: 170 go arathi
[1:54:35] AWreal: swamp of sorrows is great at 175
[1:54:36] Pannekaker: @Towelliee Yeah, saw a comment on MrGM's video about it and one of the comments was like "So this finally confirms that the boost is coming" seagLUL
[1:54:41] ClassicMalcontent: I don't like the boost. Regardless as they seem to be pushing forward now I am annoyed they will not make the LW Drums act as they were in 2.4.3 with Tinnitus. So now if #Changes then why not change Drums.
[1:54:59] oakley303: im not im just watching streamers play it i play other games
[1:55:05] SamULJackson: i cant stand them complaining about it but still end up sucking the expacs dick once it comes out
[1:55:14] RadRage69: I hate when they bring up player interaction against boosting , because fking sitting at the entrance of a dungeon afk while letting a sweaty mage boost you is a mega player interaction ... like come on...
[1:55:30] SavageELC: Can't boost BE or Drenai, its fine imo
[1:55:46] Tagon35: Are they resetting characters for TBC or will classic chars move over?
[1:55:49] tigzie: is it the pre patch when the mount costs go down for epic riding? @Towelliee
[1:55:54] Justarandomman: My only concern with TBC is some people, well quite a lot going into the expansion with 30k gold + the economy is ruined from the  off
[1:56:20] ClassicMalcontent: My problem with boosting is not players using one. Players do what players do. It's the offering that botters will use to insta-profit-bot. They purchase accounts in regions for ~$4/sub and the boost will cost less there too.
[1:56:37] SonofHorus82: @alchemicgoat cool
[1:57:33] Mortal_Wombat_: botter's dont give a rats ass about the boost. they have dozens of chars ready to go anyways
[1:57:48] WhiteKnight74648: Bet he is happy
[1:57:49] PyramidCode: @Towelliee I think I love you
[1:57:58] beyonder6969: bots DansGame
[1:58:00] ClassicMalcontent: @Mortal_Wombat_ if an bot account gets banned every new account gets straight to L58.
[1:58:00] Pannekaker: They'll just bot up a new character for cheaper than the boost anyway
[1:58:07] jak_gaming: towlleii handing out allowenecs
[1:58:08] Collected1: daym
[1:58:10] Zubberikan: I'm hyped for pre patch so I can play those sweet shamans on alliance
[1:58:11] Arwenack: Red king, eh?
[1:58:17] Lupine_Fury: Did you move off a pvp server, or did they make it like retail where you need to flag?
[1:58:19] ClassicMalcontent: @Pannekaker they would have to level their alts.
[1:58:36] ClassicMalcontent: It won't be $50 or $60 in the regions they purchase from.
[1:58:42] Pannekaker: @ClassicMalcontent, It takes them like a couple days
[1:58:54] Triist0ne: its not
[1:59:11] Arwenack: I hope that guy misspelled "rogue" intentionally
[1:59:18] Armdel: mind aswell just bot the leveling process aswell
[1:59:28] Mortal_Wombat_: @alchemicgoat that's the main problem. and i hate bots as much as the next dude. but the boost won't change anything about it
[1:59:35] Sincline387: my rogue likes rouge
[1:59:45] ClassicMalcontent: Couple of days to risk report/ban before profitable. And it takes time. Instant 58 is instant profit level. If Blizzard actually uses BOOST purchases to hire anti-BOT-GMs and not another yacht for Bobby K I'll be happy.

[2:00:07] Lupine_Fury: well, just remember you were an orc warrior on a pvp right
[2:00:20] Pannekaker: @ClassicMalcontent, It'll be much cheaper to level them
[2:00:26] Mortal_Wombat_: @alchemicgoat why would it make it worse? the chars are leveld and rdy to go before the first one is even banned. its not like they wait for a ban before they start a new one
[2:00:32] SirBearingtonGaming: @Towelliee your camera box for twitch is still up from playing outriders so your chat isn;'
[2:00:43] SirBearingtonGaming: covered
[2:00:47] Orcidbf3: Its a solid plan
[2:01:02] trevter: btw Silvermoon didn't exist in vanilla right?
[2:01:04] Hybridwarhawk: Hybridwarhawk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[2:01:08] ClassicMalcontent: @Pannekaker the regions they buy in? I think it's going to make it worthwhile. Regardless, if Blizzard uses Boost Purchases to hire a couple real anti-BOT-GMs per realm I'm good.
[2:01:10] Zansteh: how much is the epic flying?
[2:01:28] ClassicMalcontent: @Zansteh 5000g I thought?

[2:01:35] Zansteh: oh god

[2:02:29] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:02:30] Collected1: 58 ... 10 bars in?! reeee
[2:02:41] beyonder6969: yo towellie whats your/played in retail if u had to guess ?
[2:02:47] WhiteKnight74648: Let us know if you develop any superpowers with your 2nd shot
[2:02:48] ClassicMalcontent: @oldmanstoned yeah it's 58.75 (75% of the way to 59) with full rested status as you mentioned. So it's really a fast track to L60.
[2:02:56] Collected1: Towelliee : no someone said that's what the boost starts with
[2:03:20] DrDickels: !room
[2:03:20] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:03:22] SonofHorus82: @alchemicgoat dude, you really gotta move on with your life. Let it go Mr Frodo.
[2:03:40] redderrzz: @sonofhorus82 hahahahahahahahahahha
[2:03:42] redderrzz: LUL
[2:03:58] shmurcules: Where the hell do you get 3-4 months until they release tbc .. the game is pretty much ready to go
[2:03:59] ClassicMalcontent: Article on tbc wowhead com noted that it was now L58 and 75% of the way to 59 with fully rested for the boosted character.
[2:04:01] luckfore: cant wait for the boost
[2:04:01] Kenz0v1: !diablo
[2:04:01] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing the Early Access Diablo II Remastered Alpha today towPog
[2:04:15] SonofHorus82: @alchemicgoat whatever you say chief.
[2:04:18] ClassicMalcontent: @shmurcules there are still a lot of bugs.
[2:04:25] ClassicMalcontent: Do we think 5/18 is pre-patch still?
[2:04:35] ClassicMalcontent: Or June pre-patch then August launch?
[2:04:36] LumosAL: The whole bots discussion is a red herring with the boost. The simple fact is people don't like it because they see it as a short cut. That people won't have to do the 'hard' levelling they had to. Again, misrepresenting a lot of time taken for difficulty.
[2:04:37] Zansteh: damn that guy is tilted
[2:04:54] SonofHorus82: damn bro forgot his meds this morning.
[2:05:15] redderrzz: towPog
[2:05:24] redderrzz: towW
[2:05:26] Chiraakitteh: Just as easy to block someone ... better than having them piss you off
[2:05:35] St3v3nat0r: i love TBC lore wise bro and story
[2:05:37] Pannekaker: @LumosAL, They're gatekeeping the game because "I did it so others have to as well"
[2:05:39] St3v3nat0r: its so goood
[2:05:51] Mortal_Wombat_: can't wait for people to fail the fucking core @ vashj again FeelsGoodMan
[2:05:51] redderrzz: I can't wait to boost a character
[2:05:59] redderrzz: fuck levelling LUL
[2:06:00] N3llee: can we drop the debate about boost or no boost? Its coming its here... they created NEW quests just for it. Its Staying
[2:06:10] brain_wash: boo hoo and reeeeeee
[2:06:13] LumosAL: @Pannekaker yep
[2:06:33] JMoney_1331: yah rounders!
[2:06:45] redderrzz: I'm doing 2 boosts
[2:06:45] Mortal_Wombat_: @N3llee wait wut? like a tutorial thing?
[2:06:50] ClassicMalcontent: @N3llee fine. Now can they hire a couple/few dedicated anti-BOT GMs per realm and not another bonus for BK?
[2:06:54] Elmshadow: Leveling isn't hard, it's just dull
[2:06:55] seaperz: they should not have boost on retail either
[2:06:57] TMMOOF: its only 1 58 boost right?
[2:06:58] N3llee: @Mortal_Wombat_ yes
[2:07:01] jeneraljelly: as a classic andy i want my friends to be able to buy the boost so we can play together before they all quit again :)
[2:07:02] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat so what if they don't?
[2:07:04] Frostyfux: ye I think most boosters are gonna quit when they realise TBC is still the same as classic
[2:07:08] Mortal_Wombat_: @N3llee huh. interesting
[2:07:11] seaperz: to many people on 60 not even knowing all their spells
[2:07:12] trevter: you don't even have to play the game if you don't want to LUL
[2:07:27] Chiraakitteh: People kinda have less time to play than they did back in classic and tbc... were all getting old(Er) LUL
[2:07:27] N3llee: @Mortal_Wombat_ cheack wowhead Mr GM did a video
[2:07:37] Sincline387: Asmon should have to actually level rather than have people carry him.....
[2:07:40] Mortal_Wombat_: @N3llee will do. thanks

[2:07:50] St3v3nat0r: bro straight up lol reason why
[2:07:52] Pannekaker: @Mortal_Wombat_, Yeah, it's just a couple quests to introduce you to gear, talents, spells and a delivery quest to familiarize you with the main city
[2:07:56] redderrzz: I ain't got time to level, but love playing the game so boost away
[2:07:56] St3v3nat0r: me and my mates didnt play classic
[2:07:57] ClassicMalcontent: WoW TBC Token and WoW TBC 70 Boost when? Kappa
[2:08:02] St3v3nat0r: we work 10-12 hours day bro its hard to find time ot level

[2:08:08] Ramdorpser: Agreed, I don't see the big deal with this boost thing.
[2:08:14] brain_wash: srsly tho, players Freak out that they have to spend time on the game,  but then log in for 80 hrs a week sitting in Oribos....
[2:08:15] Ramdorpser: It's a 1 time thing, who cares?
[2:08:32] zacharyzorbas: I like the leveling in classic
[2:08:34] Justarandomman: nice word of the day 'antiquated'
[2:08:37] LumosAL: I didn't want to play Classic vanilla - I can't wait for TBC. There is a different market
[2:08:40] N3llee: Sick of the community beating this dead horse.. Its not going away. Blizz made custom new quests just for it.
[2:08:43] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, What're you on about seagLUL
[2:08:48] ClassicMalcontent: @Ramdorpser for real players sure. For bot accounts should they be banned , poof back to L58.
[2:08:49] Volatilestyle: $$
[2:08:59] ClassicMalcontent: @Volatilestyle yes. Yes indeed.
[2:09:03] CasualSCN: At first I was against boosts... But then I realized it's really positive to have them. Dive straight into TBC content and play TBC straight away...
[2:09:15] Dylan19_93: About howmany hours is TBC 60 > 70
[2:09:18] Zubberikan: Idk man people could hit 60 2-3 times since TBC announcement
[2:09:21] ravenoushydra: I respectfully disagree
[2:09:22] Zubberikan: Seems pretty lazy to me
[2:09:22] desmo7: I think the issue is more that the classic andys dont trust blizzard.. the boost is a gateway drug to other changes that are not classic like (lfg etc) towelliee
[2:09:28] ClassicMalcontent: @Zubberikan exactly
[2:09:37] Alepouditsa: yes that y i stop at 40 at vanila when i learn about tbc has beter lvling
[2:09:39] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat you're not robbing people! And it's not pandering - it's providing a service that some people want. Don't like it, don't pay for it.
[2:09:40] Navaeir: also: "Level 58 Boosted Characters now start at level 58 and 75% of the way to 59, with max rested experience"
[2:09:43] GiraffeHydra_: @Zubberikan yeah, but you have to play classic to do that. thats the dealbreaker lol
[2:10:09] SonofHorus82: Madseason and Asmongold have NO leg to stand on when they say that shit. I personally watched Madseason get his ass carried all the way through leveling and then get carried all the way through Rank 14. Fuck off with that horseshit.
[2:10:12] jeneraljelly: just naxx most likely
[2:10:16] srze94: why not just start at 58 without the boost. I doubt people will pay for the boost.
[2:10:17] jeneraljelly: titans helps a lot on tanks
[2:10:22] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat and your problem with that it?
[2:10:27] LumosAL: it's not your money
[2:10:32] Nasilvera: @alchemicgoat can say that about every xpac
[2:10:32] N3llee: It literally adds people into the word
[2:10:35] N3llee: how dumb
[2:10:36] LumosAL: you don't get to choose what other people do with theirs
[2:10:56] GiraffeHydra_: damn blizz taking people out of the world like that
[2:11:03] ClassicMalcontent: @SonofHorus82 okay. In game behavior is fine though, no? Swipe a credit card. I guess you are pro-monetization. That's fine. Disagree is belongs in any classic game. But so be it.
[2:11:13] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat I am defending it because I think it is good for the game
[2:11:14] gabizaoluz: I really don't understand why people are so mad about the boost. Some people don't have the time to lvl from 1
[2:11:14] N3llee: And its only one per account
[2:11:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:11:14] jorgen__d: I am leveling in classic to prepare for bc, but I am leverling completly solo, how much do i bring to the "world"
[2:11:14] Hyvest: Either you'll see me in tbc areas or not at all lol
[2:11:22] JeemTeam: ya who cares, just play the dame game or dont
[2:11:22] Galadeon: What server is Towelliee on?
[2:11:25] FresheFefe: you guys cleared mythic castle?
[2:11:26] Wildside1177: All objections to the 58 boost aare a result of the human fear of change. There are no rational reasons against it.
[2:11:28] RadRage69: whats the best addon for leveling navigation in classic? @Towelliee
[2:11:30] N3llee: its not like you can use the boost unlimitedly... its 1 per account
[2:11:32] lanara233: If people no longer want to play the game, that's fine but Blizzard are killing it prematurely to make a few bucks.
[2:11:36] donoghlen: If you want to play blood elf or Dranei then you have to lvl from lvl 1
[2:11:41] Ramdorpser: @RadRage69 I use guidelime, works great
[2:11:42] Chiraakitteh: Actual question, since it’s been so long and I started WoW at the tail end of TBC, did (or is) Blizzard change the xp progression for classic content when TBC launched?
[2:11:50] FresheFefe: oh nice
[2:11:50] RadRage69: @Ramdorpser cheers
[2:11:54] Collected1: Chiraakitteh : yes from level 20 onwards
[2:11:58] TheItalianStallion321: only thing that sucks is that i wont be able to raid with Hammer Squad, times and days do not match what im available for

[2:12:06] Bisaracade2678: not allowing blood elfs and space goats for boost was a good compromise
[2:12:08] Alastree: Yo Towelliee
[2:12:16] Collected1: Chiraakitteh : less XP per level etc and elites can be solo'ed
[2:12:17] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat again why is that your problem?
[2:12:17] ClassicMalcontent: @N3llee real players yes. Again it's not the players. It's the botters.
[2:12:28] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, How do you know that? You have nothing to base that argument on
[2:12:29] GiraffeHydra_: @boomernights you'll get people in tbc who wouldve otherwise completely skipped classic since they hate leveling. Still empty old world, now less in bc as well
[2:12:37] LumosAL: I don't get how that's bad for the game.
[2:12:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:12:38] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, And even so, why does it matter?
[2:13:04] ravenoushydra: I don't think the boost is that much of a problem but I think people that can't do 1-58 with the xp req nerf will have a hard time with all the tbc grinds
[2:13:04] Nasilvera: This guy is on a one man crusade in this chat
[2:13:08] ClassicMalcontent: @SensualMurderHornets I agree. I just hope the $$ they make from monetizing level boost is spent wisely to combat the side-effects for the botters; not the real players.
[2:13:09] N3llee: @ClassicMalcontent I dont think the botting issue will be as bad in TBC. Boost is $60 not many botters are going to buy that
[2:13:16] SonofHorus82: @ClassicMalcontent I'm all for whatever makes it better and easier for people to get to play the content that they want. People that started in TBC and want to play TBC, but dont want to play classic, should be able to play TBC without needing to go through the grind to get there. I dont understand why you all are so triggered about shit that doesnt affect you in any way.
[2:13:23] lanara233: Good point
[2:13:27] N3llee: We'll aslo have a token soon
[2:13:33] ClassicMalcontent: @N3llee again no botter pays full price. They use regions with discounted subs and services.
[2:13:37] N3llee: so that will disrupt the gold selling market
[2:13:39] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat you're conflating things together. So it's bad for them to make money? Or bad for the game? You keep changing your argument.
[2:13:40] Arakawa__: there will always be people leveling in azeroth
[2:13:40] imchonkypanda: I am a new player only 150ish hours and still feel so lost any tips?
[2:13:43] DrakhanGaming: blizzard doesnt need anymore cash why would the boost be strictly a cash grab?
[2:13:43] JeemTeam: @alchemicgoat what problems will it create that is not already in the game?
[2:13:56] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, It's not so much that they can't, but that they won't because they don't find grinding in the old world fun when all their friends are in Outlands
[2:14:04] oakley303: wow is just a boring game
[2:14:06] N3llee: @ClassicMalcontent follow the news on the changes they made to the region price stuff. A bunch of it went up
[2:14:06] GiraffeHydra_: @ClassicMalcontent amen to that, cybersec in general is just a pain in the ass. Always playing catch-up to people making zero day shit. I imagine most of them spend the days drinking and saying "Wait, they did fucking what now?" lol
[2:14:06] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:14:10] ClassicMalcontent: @DrakhanGaming you saw the bonus the ActiBlizz CEO got no?
[2:14:10] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat I'm not mad. Just trying to understand your PoV ;-)
[2:14:13] Chiraakitteh: @collected1 And all, thanks I was a noob player back then and had no clue, then WotLK came out and mostly I remember swimming up and down coastlines to avoid zombies on my druid haha
[2:14:29] RadRage69: can you transfer a character from pve server to pvp server?
[2:14:34] N3llee: Again not saying there wont be botting.. just dont think it will be as bas classic.
[2:14:35] Collected1: invasion of the blood elves
[2:14:36] Mortal_Wombat_: i will be that one druid in a sea of paladins FeelsGoodMan
[2:14:40] Sarocus: @RadRage69 nope
[2:14:42] JeemTeam: thats not an argment
[2:14:43] Snacktooth: dks
[2:14:49] oakley303: that was back in the days @Towelliee  now wow is 12 years further it wont be the same dude.
[2:14:51] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, Maybe they couldn't back when Classic launched? Maybe they were only really interested in BC?
[2:14:51] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee 5 man DK groups were a treasure lol
[2:14:56] donoghlen: well DKs started at 58
[2:14:57] ClassicMalcontent: @N3llee you can still get an account in Argentina with access to US for ~$4/sub and the boost we'll see. It will still be less than $60 *assuming Blizz prices it that high.
[2:15:02] Sincline387: There was nothing more fun than sitting in hellfire waiting for the fresh DKs......
[2:15:04] TMMOOF: 5 DK Hellfire Ramparts LUL
[2:15:09] Khandak: @ClassicMalcontent and then they make a tournament with a 20k prize pull for 5 teams
[2:15:10] Dylan19_93: omg that DK starter zone was hell even after a few weeks
[2:15:15] Collected1: haha oh god the 5 DK dungeon runs
[2:15:16] raldrik: I wish they would still evolve the main world. Change NPC chatter and some quests to align with the current expansion. Make leveling on the main continents feel more inline with top level content.
[2:15:16] Collected1: i remember that
[2:15:21] aldonty_: @Towelliee woo haven't been here in sometime you moving or just redesigning the room?
[2:15:22] TheNextKing306: take it from the og towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:15:25] TMMOOF: @Collected1  YEE!!!
[2:15:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: there was a druid that tried to gank deathknights in hellfire on my server and about 30 of us kicked his ass so many times, we kept gripping him back down when he tried to fly off
[2:15:39] ClassicMalcontent: @Khandak ha yeah i forgot about that. $20k tourney LUL Bobby K 8 figure bonuses
[2:15:41] donoghlen: mage boosting in TBC takes about 2-3 times as long with the aoe cap
[2:15:42] N3llee: @ClassicMalcontent pretty sure it requires more money now with the 60 day Sub thing and the changes to the plan costs in some (not all regional areas)
[2:15:45] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, That's such a stupid argument seagLUL
[2:15:46] oakley303: that won't be the same anymore that was back in the days when there werent another good games now you have more games it wont be the same anymore
[2:15:49] Wildside1177: That is equity mindset....lol
[2:15:49] Sincline387: I want blizzard to fix dumb players.....oh wait
[2:15:59] Ctrain111: Doesn’t blizzard get aoe capped in TBC?
[2:16:04] Xockel: I dont get why people care about others, care about your own gameplay. Who gives a f***.
[2:16:07] Khandak: @ClassicMalcontent hahah exactly
[2:16:07] N3llee: I mean Mage boost does get fixed to some degree with the Aoe cap
[2:16:18] Dylan19_93: Ì dont mind boosting but i wish it wasnt allowed to spam "WTS boost  msg in a LFG channel
[2:16:30] TheVigiliance: Who hates mage boosting? It litteraly affects no one but the one buying the boost
[2:16:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: people also choose to be towIgnit
[2:16:35] Spudies: Love this lol
[2:16:37] Divinos572: You have to let the free market do what it does lol
[2:16:39] Mortal_Wombat_: @alchemicgoat what do you think where that gold comes from?
[2:16:41] lanara233: People will always have different opinions about boosting.
[2:16:44] N3llee: thank god @Towelliee
[2:16:46] Iver_monk: I'm for reall aa ron
[2:16:50] ClassicMalcontent: Let's be honest if Blizzard was better at banning BOTTERS none of this would even be an issue.
[2:17:08] DrakhanGaming: idgaf about the boost just let me play a blood elf already ffs

[2:17:28] Sarocus: Is there room in the guild? I'm on Faerlina right now, but thinking a pvp server might not be for me
[2:17:29] georgiebulgarianfart_king: FailFish
[2:17:33] ClassicMalcontent: In-game behavior is fine.

[2:18:25] RadRage69: will they add gender change in tbc?
[2:18:29] SonofHorus82: @alchemicgoat I don't think you can come off like that and then include no punctuation in your statement.
[2:18:31] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee u need a zg booster
[2:18:40] ClassicMalcontent: I levelled my Warrior to 60 IRON MAN style. When soloing learned how to pull/kite ONE MOB AT A TIME LUL
[2:18:49] Chiraakitteh: If you hate obvious botters, kite mobs on top of then with a stealth class and vanish. Kappa
[2:18:54] stjon13: I get what you're saying but it's waaay to much of a problem, finding holy trinity dung runs.
[2:19:07] TheAverageGoob: Are you moving? What happened to your room?
[2:19:10] yazzi152: NO MORE OUT RIDERS

[2:19:12] MetallicusGaming: !room
[2:19:12] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:19:17] xAshleyCyanidex: !room
[2:19:19] ClassicMalcontent: @Chiraakitteh if that's all you wanted to do all day. The bot script just sends them back.
[2:19:20] Mortal_Wombat_: just blocking that guy now. can't argue with stupid
[2:19:20] yazzi152: sorry caps
[2:19:27] N3llee: I'm sure we'll get paid services like transfers (less then 90 day cd), Faction Swap, Gender, NAme swap, etc
[2:19:43] Chiraakitteh: @classicmalcontent Gotta have your fun somehow.
[2:19:43] Fourside_yL: big true
[2:19:45] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, Most of the people paying for mage boosts already have max level characters that have bought gold
[2:19:50] oakley303: wont happen programmers are more smart then blizzard developers
[2:19:58] KillaPr0: not going to happen
[2:20:01] jeneraljelly: people should swap their efforts from getting boosts banned to bots lel
[2:20:01] CasualSCN: Hire? LOL they been laying off people they don't hire XD
[2:20:01] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat so you don't like the boost because it's going to steal your business? There we go, we got there in the end.
[2:20:04] cosmothug: @Towelliee your shadowlands vid on youtube was really good. do you feel like shadowlands will get more "world" content or will everything halfway interesting remain in instanced content?
[2:20:19] donoghlen: They need someone to just look a every rogue in BRD that is in no guild solo........
[2:20:19] Dyriks: Dyriks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 86 months! gotta sell them primal mights before they go cheap
[2:20:31] oakley303: its the same with fps games people programming aimbots to be better @Towelliee  :)
[2:20:37] PadidinJones: I am 100% in agreement with you @Towelliee botters really shit the economy and its time Blizzard wreck their asses
[2:20:40] ClassicMalcontent: It's because Blizzard isn't dealing with the botters that makes the boost a problem. The boost itself is fine. I want the Boost Fees to go to hire several real anti-bot-GMs. Give people some jobs! Not another yacht for BK.
[2:20:56] georgiebulgarianfart_king: @Towelliee  shadowlands is dead
[2:20:58] luckfore: i think its smaller than we hope for
[2:20:58] MrGattz: you know how to fix it @Towelliee all you have to do is have a automatic captcha pop up randomly on everyones accounts. tanking in the middle of a dungoen? BAM captcha. last 5% of a mythic raid boss? BAM captcha. will solve the bot issues 100% i promise
[2:21:13] Valdur359: @Towelliee hey dude can you recommend weak aura for vengeance dh
[2:21:22] oakley303: captcha wil be bypassed to @MrGattz  programmers are not idiots
[2:21:25] Ruebikcube: @alchemicgoat why do you assume players are going to pay for boosts then not play the game?
[2:21:27] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, Why do you assume they haven't bought gold? I can guarantee you that most of the people that buy gold is not "new" players
[2:21:32] drRoswell: i bot on 22 classic accounts for almost a year now without issues,its very lucrative and i dont give a f about blizz XD
[2:21:40] Lupine_Fury: level 19+ torghast we havent seen
[2:21:40] Baldarsar: swifty just got 51 years old today, holly shit
[2:21:51] CarrKinn: @Towelliee will you give ashes of creation a try when it is released?
[2:22:08] luckfore: any idea when 9.1 ptr is out?
[2:22:10] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, The people that don't like the game won't play it in the first place nmpWeird
[2:22:16] Dyriks: ingame captcha where I have to figure out if it's a melee weapon or a mount LUL
[2:22:18] LumosAL: @alchemicgoat why would you spend lots of your own real money on a game you don't like? You know your argument is illogical, right?
[2:22:24] georgiebulgarianfart_king: @luckfore  next week
[2:22:27] SonofHorus82: Jesus he's still going on in chat... Where's Gatt with a banhammer when you need him.
[2:22:35] Mortal_Wombat_: didn't they say there will be like 8 dungeons in alpha? or was that a different game
[2:22:35] Nasilvera: @alchemicgoat who cares if they quit why do you

[2:22:59] MrGattz: @alchemicgoat ok enough mate lol boosts are fine. theres nothing wrong with them, weve gone over this already
[2:22:59] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, Because the people that're gonna buy the boost actually want to play the game? Why is this so hard for you to understand
[2:22:59] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:23:19] Pannekaker: @alchemicgoat, Maybe they couldn't play the game when it came out?
[2:23:23] Blackmamba_S: @alchemicgoat lmao 🤣
[2:23:23] SonofHorus82: @MrGattz our savior!
[2:23:25] RadRage69: im hype af for the boost
[2:23:36] MrGattz: yeah he did that not me
[2:23:37] Pannekaker: Well that works lol
[2:23:39] ClassicMalcontent: @shmurcules seems a bit soon. Leaked date of 5/18 was estimated pre-patch. I think June pre-patch August release. At least I hope for a couple months of pre-patch with the XP changes.
[2:23:47] MrGattz: im to nice in my old age

[2:24:34] Dyriks: I'm hitting 32 years next month :(
[2:24:41] donoghlen: Call of duty has more anti cheat software than WoW
[2:24:43] Mortal_Wombat_: you will never win the fight against bots. but it would be nice if they fought a little harder atleast
[2:24:47] oakley303: im 39 i wil be 40 in december
[2:24:48] donoghlen: and they owned by the same company
[2:24:49] Pusicq: Cheats in competetive FPSes is more gamebreaking aswell though @Towelliee
[2:24:57] ZakuzaGB: i keep wanting to log in but i canny do it
[2:24:58] Quakezilla69: If you can buy epic flying from cash shop would you?
[2:25:18] Pannekaker: It makes sense though, cheats in competitive games like COD is way worse than in a game like WoW

[2:25:27] donoghlen: Thats why I think TBC will come out at end of Q2
[2:25:28] Collected1: they can pad their meters by letting me buy the hippo mount
[2:25:29] N3llee: At least susstain them
[2:25:30] DallTV_: I will boost in tjc
[2:25:30] jeneraljelly: not even sure what 9.1 would have to bring to bring my back to retail
[2:25:32] Layercake: Uncle Bobby is getting hungry
[2:25:34] DrakhanGaming: why is 9.1 taking so long anyway? did they start working on it after people cleared nathria?
[2:25:38] SonofHorus82: @Dyriks I hit 39 in January. Every time I see someone say that they're in their early 30's I always feel like Adam Sandler in Billy Madison. Don't leave it for the love of god!
[2:25:41] donoghlen: and 9.1 will come out in early Q3
[2:25:47] oakley303: -_- im getting old)

[2:26:53] CrumbySmash: whats up with toweliee so dark :D
[2:26:55] rbailey_2222: im about to turn 30 in 10 days
[2:26:59] Mortal_Wombat_: @DrakhanGaming pretty sure d2:r is coming this year
[2:27:07] Blackmamba_S: I think at 30 ur not "figuring things out" ur just a mess BibleThump
[2:27:25] oakley303: i dont get it why people are agains cheats cheats make you better at the game :)
[2:27:30] Chiraakitteh: 30 isn’t too bad... 45 on the other hand, you start feeling old LUL
[2:27:32] SonofHorus82: @BlackMamba_S stop the aging! Seriously I remember going to bed at when 29, turning 30 overnight, and waking up to everything hurting.
[2:27:32] Avinar: I turned 30 a few months ago. oddly I instantly started having more body aches some days and foot got swollen one day. hitting 30 is weird
[2:27:43] PokerFaceMoose: @rbailey_2222 the age 30 says, let me introduce you to hemerroids.
[2:27:46] oakley303: like a rotation bot for people with handicap

[2:28:09] N3llee: @Towelliee really think bc will be that legit?
[2:28:16] Wildside1177: Buy a couple of shares. They will automatically send you their quarterly reports.
[2:28:20] luckfore: everything is made already, shadowlands is all new stuff
[2:28:20] Avinar: then omar left PepeHands
[2:28:21] Mortal_Wombat_: people complaining about hittng 30 soon and im sitting here and can't even remember how it felt KEKW
[2:28:45] brain_wash: just embrace it, cant run from time my dudes
[2:28:46] Quakezilla69: considered maining BC over retail. Just to shake it up a bit
[2:28:56] oakley303: don't you get burned out doing this over and over?
[2:28:57] SonofHorus82: @BlackMamba_S I also remember going to the doctor in my mid-30s and being told that my knees are about 20 years older than the rest of me. So you have that to look forward to as well :)
[2:29:17] Sarocus: Geddim!
[2:29:27] AusTennGames: daaaaaaaaaaays
[2:29:53] MalaterisTV: venari rep is now account widew
[2:29:54] etter00: @towelliee I was at the grocery store yesterday and saw a hammer sticker on a car that I swear was your icon. I yelled out "Hammer Squad". The driver looked at me and said "Thor great, right". I was so embarrassed.
[2:30:15] Quakezilla69: I think if they add another, it will really blow back on them. Given the overall fan base opinion at the moment
[2:30:23] zauriel_l: isn't this great tho
[2:30:25] Dyriks: WutFace

[2:31:32] MuttonChopins: since WoD?
[2:31:40] xDreadBeard: Would they not see that the lack of content caused that?
[2:31:45] Quakezilla69: Do you think the gearing process sort of being shitty outside of pvp is one of the giant issues?
[2:31:49] PoppaShot: @Towelliee prob also didnt help that their raid Mythic wise was full of bugs

[2:32:06] oakley303: blizzard through people wouldnt care but now they see the player base and wtf we need to do something:0
[2:32:38] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I feel like we players are experiencing the worst case scenario given the situation with Covid and blizz employees working from home
[2:32:43] PokerFaceMoose: dreamfoil, plaguebloom
[2:32:49] DallTV_: But covid was something to do with it
[2:32:56] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee goldhorns
[2:32:56] Pannekaker: @PadidinJones, Yeah, it's a real shame
[2:33:05] Wildside1177: Dreamfoil and plaguebloom sell.

[2:33:14] BlaqPvP: mageroyal should be up there too
[2:33:18] PadidinJones: @DallDK Basically had everyting to do with it
[2:33:29] Blackmamba_S: @sonofhorus82 damn man. seems like time ages the body,  but for me I still got the brains of a 16 year old lmao. wondering when it will catch up.
[2:34:01] Avinar: @Beyond_The_Invisible can at least get the mog for my DH LUL
[2:34:23] SonofHorus82: @BlackMamba_S oh dont worry I still have the brains and mentality of a teenager. Men will always find things funny, no matter what age they are.
[2:34:37] Alexakosgg: nice physique
[2:34:48] BTiZZY_: no outriders today @towelliee ??
[2:34:56] DallTV_: @padidinjones yeah hard to get back from only thing looking forward
[2:35:07] codedizle: @avinar I went back to ESO for now LUL
[2:35:13] GiraffeHydra_: @BlackMamba_S time ages the body, life ages the mind
[2:35:26] jerexify: @Towelliee That Hunter is asking for the leather. His name is Huntbruises.
[2:35:30] jollejox: anyone knows how much honor gets nerfed in prepatch? 1/2 or more?
[2:35:33] Blvdman: lol

[2:35:43] imallin1234: pfff if there was no covid image

[2:35:53] jerexify: lol He was right beside you... :D
[2:35:54] Fourside_yL: they just let to many people go (or fired them) closing eu HQ..
[2:35:56] CarrKinn: its probably pretty difficult to do that kind of work from home....
[2:36:18] MrGattz: its extremely difficult
[2:36:33] Wildside1177: So much impromptu collaboration happens in an office. All of that is lost working from home.
[2:36:38] CarrKinn: some jobs are easy to do from home, developing a game like this from home, not so much
[2:36:52] Blackmamba_S: @sensualmurderhornets yeah that seems right. wise words.
[2:36:54] Dyriks: I just had to turn on funky town for my sub LUL
[2:36:57] MrGattz: its not an ordinary office job working for game dev. you need to be in communication with your entire team like constantly.
[2:37:05] Bharomir: Hom many time did you take to lvl from lvl 1 to 60 ?
[2:37:10] PadidinJones: As someone that works in tech I can completely relate. Its hard communicating with colleagues to achieve goals. I feel like we have to be herculean all the time
[2:37:10] nheonkitty: Still playing Outrider @towelliee ? My husband is hooked on it after watching your stream.🤨
[2:37:13] MetallicusGaming: fourside_92 you do know that there were zero coders in that HQ? those were all qa department
[2:37:16] GiraffeHydra_: @BlackMamba_S gotta roll 20 on that wis check once in a blue moon lol
[2:37:19] SonofHorus82: @BlackMamba_S yeah it's not all bad.
[2:37:34] codedizle: @avinar I'm just waiting for the prepatch and I'll go back to classic
[2:37:38] Multimon89: Launch date of bc? Do we know yet?

[4:25:26] Crunker01: @Towelliee I think they were trying to be reminiscent of Mal'ganis in Warcraft 3 and how he'd pop up as you progressed through the story
[4:25:27] Kromede: IonJam
[4:25:30] zenFX_: The end of wrath was just the same as the  end of cata, complete dogshit. Wrath was only good up to 3.2

[5:23:25] cinnamints: Just built a PC (no GPU upgrade yet) and many components are higher right now due to processor shortages & demand. So if someone wants a prebuilt, the markup from a really good prebuild company like Origin may not be as much as one thinks with the way everything else is priced at the moment.
[5:23:32] Collected1: i'd call it a promotional event today
[5:23:41] Vanhoek: @neverbornlucky Its understanding whats good between the 7000 companies that build the different parts.

[6:27:03] neon_v4: They wont get punished and get to keep everything
[6:27:40] alex12645: LUL
[6:27:50] Instigaetor653: It was an exploit. These guys are handling it right. The exploit was the devs fault, not the players.
[6:27:55] 3663Sharad: Exploit early, exploit often. its always true D:
[6:28:27] neverbornlucky: thats cause mrgm didnt tell towelliee too
[6:29:15] Skylin3r: noooo not blighted rounds
[6:29:17] Mr_Pennywise_: yep
[6:29:37] hammack52: its a 15% dAMAGE NERF
[6:29:44] Instigaetor653: @Biby07 haha no. The devs put it in the game, accidently or not, and if you take advantage of it then that is on them to fix.
[6:29:47] CDubTheRIPper: noooo pyro nerf
[6:30:02] MrGattz: @instigaetor653 did you just say the exploit is the devs fault? LUL
[6:30:02] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:30:08] Instigaetor653: @Towelliee SO TOTALLY AGREE!!!
[6:30:12] Tsunami_Samurai22: wow that pyro nerf is bs
[6:30:20] MrGattz: if this was wow they would all be banned
[6:30:26] mitchumtx: You gonna stream patch 5.5 FFXIV?
[6:30:27] EthicalHermit: @Towelliee they probably don't have a system to track it
[6:30:30] hammack52: sorry it is about a 30% damage nerf
[6:30:33] Kinghorn: exploit early and often
[6:30:37] CDubTheRIPper: you would think so since its square enix and their policy with FF14
[6:30:38] MrGattz: yeah thats not a good look
[6:30:41] PokerFaceMoose: in the future they will ban you and people will get mad they are not being consistent
[6:30:45] guni1980: So they should ban 70% of the playerbase
[6:31:12] Skylin3r: honestly it's still strong with the gear mods
[6:31:19] MrGattz: yeah. maybe not straight up ban them
[6:31:23] Instigaetor653: @MrGattz yes i said that. they made the mistake of leaving or putting it in the game. if you used it, its their fault. I didnt say that makes you right.
[6:31:25] MrGattz: but like a few weeks or something
[6:31:33] Skylin3r: 30% ammo back on kill makes it endless
[6:31:50] PlaguedV: and then promptly get nerfed again
[6:31:52] PlaguedV: LUL
[6:32:10] nodadl0l: !room
[6:32:10] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[6:32:13] CDubTheRIPper: you and sloot are the shining example of devastators that can do high dmg. people apparently are getting kicked for being dev LUL
[6:32:13] Skylin3r: guess i should push for max gear lvl before the patch and nerf
[6:32:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: Diablo towPog
[6:33:05] SicDogg: is it new cinematics also ??
