[1:51:31] Minxkin8: ye
[1:51:42] GroovyBryan: You think it's worth leveling a fresh toon right now for Wotlk?

[1:57:28] jackpepsimba: stoked for wrath. have any thoughts for wotlk pvp alts?

[1:58:36] Kespec: i first heard about swifty from his tbc videos, he was trying to deal the most single damage. it was amazing, top quality content.
[1:58:46] Ownedbyducky: you have been playing wow for so long now, what keeps you interested after all these years?
[1:58:52] Oorgnid: If they fix the faction balance come WotLK, I'll continue my pally on Bene, if not, I"ll probably just reroll on fresh starts

[1:59:27] brian_777777777: swifty actually really likes frost too i think its actually better than unholy
[1:59:30] Cyrukh: most ppl will play ppal or preg
[1:59:36] brian_777777777: and it will be if they launch wrath in its later state

[2:02:50] Oorgnid: Borean Tundra can get you to like level 72 if you do all the quests
[2:03:37] Oorgnid: Hmm, but is it going to be like they did before, where the exp is reduced?

[2:04:56] Oorgnid: He's going to ready for wrath, WHEN IT'S READY BABY
[2:05:26] alex_kourn: The time we're gonna have to level on fresh realms all the way to level 70 is going to be enough right ? We're also going to have the 50% exp bonus.
[2:05:51] alex_kourn: enough to be ready for release at least

[2:08:23] Oorgnid: I"m guessing September is when WotLK is coming, especially with Dragonflight coming 2022.  They're not going to conflict their own expansion
[2:08:43] JohnyChaka: dragonflight annoucned before 2023 so wrath must be before
[2:08:46] redvirusbg: 5 ? omg
[2:08:50] NinjaChane: I was going to say September or October
[2:08:50] Oorgnid: Honestly feels like more people are hyped for WotLK over Dragon
[2:08:52] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[2:08:54] JohnyChaka: @Oorgnid agreed
[2:09:21] NinjaChane: they are also flying through with the beta too

[2:10:09] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Plasma Connection by Harris Heller -> https://prtzl.io/wyHV5POzKQbXPBUV
[2:10:31] NinjaChane: my guess would be mid August pre patch with a October release
[2:10:52] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:11:20] headgrumble: Will there be character copy for wotlk?
[2:11:24] Oorgnid: I mean, the Beta doesn't really have much to test.  If anything really needs tested, would be their QoL they plan to add or whatever
[2:11:46] gotcha2157: pre patch end of the month release end of august
[2:11:48] NinjaChane: season 4 starts August 2nd for retail
[2:11:53] tutubela: Beta testing for WoTLK ended like 14 years ago didn't it
[2:12:16] JohnyChaka: wrath september lets be optimistic :)
[2:12:22] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[2:12:45] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Onyx by Scandroid -> https://prtzl.io/pLHOVodo3Z4WD3c8
[2:12:47] tangdill: When is woltk release?
[2:12:51] NinjaChane: yeah I still think Dragonflight gets pushed to 2023
[2:13:20] Hammybone: !server
[2:13:22] Oorgnid: WotLK will be released 3-4 months prior than DF, because all the sweaty hardcores will have Nax completed by then to hop over to DF
[2:13:32] tutubela: @NinjaChane It can get pushed to 2024 for all I care, if we get a good expansion with a story that's actually not a bunch of doodoo
[2:14:00] galifax2: my fury warrior is 48 in tbc now, surprised i havent given up yet
[2:14:01] NinjaChane: I agree, I just want them to take their time with it.
[2:14:32] tutubela: Yeah, in the meantime we can do some nostalgia with WoTLK and grind ICC for 12 months
[2:14:35] galifax2: fury has one downside with leveling and that is if you constantly miss/dodge/parry attacks you wont do much
[2:14:46] NinjaChane: I'll be busy with Wrath anywho
[2:15:10] Oorgnid: I wont be doing DF.  WotLK is all I'm coming back for
[2:15:48] galifax2: i will do both honestly

[2:16:24] galifax2: wrath im really waiting on the 50% exp boost to get prepared for, df im worried about them not having testing time

[2:16:54] ehweron: wrath wow token Pog
[2:17:52] greypilgrimz: Swifty I love your stream simply for the fact that u don't use foul language =)
[2:18:05] NinjaChane: I do find it funny that the expansions that really could have used some tweaks Vanilla and TBC were "no changes" and the critically acclaimed expansion Wrath is where they want to introduce "some changes"
[2:18:23] Pepyte: Hello Swifty love your stream <3
[2:18:30] alex_kourn: I think the reason that they are doing this is to get rid of boosting in general because it actually deminishes the whole game imo. As new players cant find any groups to do dungeons with since most of thje people are on their alts getting boosted
[2:19:08] un_original: why is it funny ? no changes proved that changes are necessary because the community is so f*ed
[2:19:23] toxicwatch: toxicwatch subscribed with Prime. 
[2:19:23] StreamElements: toxicwatch just subscribed PogChamp
[2:19:32] redvirusbg: I donnt like boost i want normal groups
[2:19:42] Cowardpatty: It's not what I want, and that's why I'm not playing it.  Goes against the spirit of the game.
[2:19:44] mrzugg: lvl boosting?
[2:19:52] NinjaChane: it's funny because of how Blizzard thinks
[2:20:06] Serpzy: if the vast majority of players are gonna use a LFG addon then whats the point in removing the feature?]
[2:20:06] mrzugg: why dont they just make dungeon exp just terrible?
[2:20:40] creighton_m: Any idea on the XP buff release?
[2:20:45] herjoyfulness: Just add -100% xp if there's a max level character in the party with you, easy

[2:21:24] ehweron: @herjoyfulness 5head
[2:21:41] galifax2: 6-8 weeks, including i believe they said 4 weeks of pre patch
[2:21:48] 1bawssman1: nah, blizz said, at least 2 week no more than 6 weeks
[2:21:53] alex_kourn: The EXP boost is going to be that long not prepatch
[2:22:17] peonchop: Hey Swifty, did you hear about the new Dragonflight feature, where you will be able to build meaningful relationships with dragon companions, including romance?
[2:22:18] creighton_m: Im so excited for the XP boost

[2:22:35] creighton_m: might be easy to find dungeons while lvling with all the people on Alts
[2:22:54] alex_kourn: @creighton_m I hope they release the fresh realms too with the exp boost
[2:23:21] aviduser2: little hilfe ofc
[2:23:38] Oorgnid: They are releasing fresh realms. It's to help combat "faction imbalance" and give people a fresh start

[2:24:19] mario_judah1212: yeah it took me like 3 hours
[2:24:20] biggsmacker: it's not really an xp boost.  you get 10% more xp on things you kill.
[2:24:27] aviduser2: if u made another alt, what class would u pick
[2:24:30] peonchop: Hey Swifty, did you hear about the new Dragonflight feature, where you will be able to build meaningful relationships with dragon companions, including romance?
[2:24:43] Mordrah: There will be another boost
