[4:45:01] Sphinx2k: You can turn off overlay stuff in options
[4:45:07] WOOPsWOOP: I had to do that
[4:45:10] Doog45: yes this is why I went with 10 for my new build
[4:45:19] deathdemonic99: i think you can play overwatch 2 now if you purchase the pack you get beta access
[4:45:20] satvika144: is windows 11 better

[4:45:28] OoPaHc: 100%!!
[4:45:35] Galdrena: :O
[4:45:41] Vidral: That utilization was nuts
[4:45:44] OoPaHc: youre also running wow as well
[4:45:57] Sphinx2k: Running multiple games at once hasn't got anything to do with it... Kappa
[4:46:06] cupraak: downgrade that W11 dude put W10 Pro
[4:46:19] OoPaHc: repair it
[4:46:20] ryanblue98: close wow then try it
[4:46:24] dustysubaru: swiftyPsad swiftyPsad swiftyPsad swiftyPsad
[4:46:28] YUKONAMI: shaders installation on launch
[4:46:31] newkingcody: cpu got REKT
[4:46:43] newkingcody: close wow @Swifty
[4:46:44] Silentstorm13318: Yeah dude, your cpu looks overclocked to me
[4:46:45] Molandzer: What a great game :)
[4:46:47] newkingcody: close wow
[4:46:48] Vidral: Apologies if this was asked. Which CPU did we go with?
[4:46:57] newkingcody: close wow !!!!
[4:46:57] braddogg07: Que sucede?
[4:46:59] Bgarrison1: Launch it without wow playing
[4:46:59] YUKONAMI: looks like your cpu over overclocked
[4:47:02] Doog45: but it is going from 43% to with wow to 100% with cod also
[4:47:03] Silentstorm13318: Some system boards automatically overlock your cpu.
[4:47:10] barclain2021: W11 is def not better. issues with games and software like photoshop and lightroom etc. too new and so on
[4:47:10] newkingcody: close wow
[4:47:13] TheEndIsNear777: His cpu base is 3. something and its 4. something so its overclocked
[4:47:25] Bgarrison1: Close wow and then launch it
[4:47:31] Silentstorm13318: @trent0ne Bro I already said that.  Pay closer attention.  SMH
[4:47:35] newkingcody: thats call of duty + wow running
[4:47:35] barclain2021: my pc is older and nowhere near as good yet I have no issues running Black Ops 4
[4:47:45] Sunglassestony: I can't remember what or if windows 10 had these issues when it first released
[4:47:48] Vidral: I've found a number of games that have issues launching using a 12th gen CPU.
[4:47:52] OoPaHc: It doesnt really matter, his pc is good enough to have both of those games open, there is something else going on.
[4:48:12] Vidral: Architecture on 12th gen is radically different
[4:48:16] Silentstorm13318: John, you could have several processes open and that wouldn't change a thing.  You have a 24 core processor.

[4:48:36] YUKONAMI: @Silentstorm13318 so? I can't say anything then? what a person you are?
[4:48:45] jorgeluvsu: LUL
[4:48:51] Sphinx2k: oh look...
[4:48:57] Doog45: but it didnt crash
[4:48:58] OoPaHc: thats normal
[4:49:00] Cowardpatty: Frankly, I did not think closing WoW would fix it.
[4:49:02] Silentstorm13318: John, update your graphics card or go into bios and make sure it isn't overclocked.
[4:49:20] Sphinx2k: Modern CPUs are designed to run at 100% continually just fine.
[4:49:21] Bgarrison1: Let it load everything then it should chill out
[4:49:26] deathdemonic99: think you can play overwatch 2 now if you purchase the pack you get beta access
[4:49:31] Silentstorm13318: @trent0ne The fact that the same wording was said.  Yeah man.
[4:49:33] AmaritheTV: That is not correct
[4:49:39] AmaritheTV: dont mind the utilization
[4:49:40] newkingcody: CPU GETTING REKT
[4:49:45] Sphinx2k: Graphics is GPU based, not CPU
[4:49:46] Molandzer: You need a beter computer swifty Kappa
[4:49:51] Predraiser: Looks like its compiling shaders.
[4:49:55] OoPaHc: swifty its fine if its at 100
[4:49:56] Predraiser: Let it do that first.
[4:50:00] AmaritheTV: its not properly showing the CPU utliization
[4:50:06] Bgarrison1: Let it load everything then it should chill out a bit
[4:50:30] Sphinx2k: Why lower graphics?
[4:50:50] OoPaHc: you want your render resolution at 100%
[4:50:56] newkingcody: turn on vsync
[4:50:57] Sphinx2k: CPU isn't graphics Swiftybro
[4:50:57] OoPaHc: otherwise it will be blurry
[4:51:21] lilbubblegumski: you need to change the game youre playin on twitch
[4:51:22] deathdemonic99: should play overwatch 2 beta instead XD
[4:51:29] YUKONAMI: @Silentstorm13318 I don't even know that you existing before you @ me. you should lower your ego
[4:51:30] Bgarrison1: It’s dropping now
[4:51:38] Bgarrison1: Definitely bounces around
[4:51:38] chopsaki: it's compiling shaders right now
[4:51:44] newkingcody: turn on vsync
[4:51:45] Sphinx2k: Graphics is powered by your GTX graphics card, not CPU.
[4:51:49] chopsaki: that's not the actual game
[4:51:56] OoPaHc: its always going to be at 100% cpu in this gmae, dont change graphics for that. Your CPU and GPU are different
[4:52:03] Bgarrison1: Oh it’s compiling shaders let that finish and it should drop
[4:52:05] barclain2021: @Swifty DUDE look at TOP of SCREEN...it's installing shaders

[4:52:42] Ascendor81: @Swifty you are still in WoW game catagory..
[4:52:45] Sphinx2k: Graphics is powered by your GTX graphics card, not CPU. Changing graphics won't lower CPU.
[4:52:54] gotcha2157: shaders
[4:52:56] OoPaHc: Swifty you paid a lot to have that pc, stop lowering the graphics lol... you can run it at ultra
[4:52:56] GergeCoelho: MW is badly unoptimized
[4:52:57] barclain2021: 1+1 = 2 installing = more usuage
[4:53:07] Bgarrison1: @ascendor81 doesn’t matter he’s just here for a second
[4:53:11] Safesage: the shaders
[4:53:17] hightio: Patience, young Swifty.  Once the shaders have completed their installation I think you will find your computer station quite.. operational
[4:53:18] Ascendor81: lol 100% CPU usage???
[4:53:24] gotcha2157: it should go down when its done installing the shaders
[4:53:27] newkingcody: graphics is running from your graphics card not cpu
[4:53:27] Cowardpatty: Make sure you don't have Minesweeper running in the background ;-)
[4:53:27] Sphinx2k: You don't need to lower graphics, I would run on max.
