[1:42:59] iNSANEono: Also, you try to be friends with a new group whose idea of top comedy is making fun of peoples pronunciation every time they try to speak. I had to think about what to say before saying it every time, cause if the sentence contained the letter "J", they would not listen and just make fun of you. A lot of other members experienced this too, and they've just stopped talking too, falling into the nobody category.
