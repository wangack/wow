[1:08:21] Begasaur: they chose gold over quests
[1:08:32] riece_: people already have 4-digit gold at level 25 this economy is super weird
[1:09:24] riece_: lvl 25 mages making 100-150g per hour soloing instances was so fried

[3:15:26] 胡賈斯汀: me too
[3:15:33] 胡賈斯汀: I don't think dk will get any buff
[3:15:41] 胡賈斯汀: furthermore
[3:15:57] 胡賈斯汀: DK usually only can play unholy
[3:16:08] 胡賈斯汀: seldom can play frost
[3:17:54] 胡賈斯汀: no idea why they nerf every dk's defense skill
[3:18:01] 胡賈斯汀: start from 9.2
[3:18:15] 胡賈斯汀: the zone
[3:18:31] 胡賈斯汀: more and more
[3:20:00] sunileif: good point nerf rogue cloak of shadows

[3:25:23] Meadamemnon: @notmes of course!
[3:25:35] sunileif: dk needs a pvp talent to resist rogue utilities by 25%
[3:25:56] BruceleeDK: Yeah it's really not likely at all, just a hope lol
[3:26:11] krome2dadome: not even rogues deserve what rogues have
[3:27:13] BruceleeDK: Yeah I enjoyed the glass cannon version too when we could actually do meaningful damage
[3:27:39] BruceleeDK: I actually haven't played the game since the last patch day on the nerfs
[3:27:44] sunileif: like sense undead , give DK sense d bag letting you see stealthies within 20 yeards
[3:28:18] Anhak: thats classic human racial
[3:29:01] sunileif: ya it was a huinter ability too but rogues cried and it got removed'
[3:30:05] Polyrhythmz: idk how a good mage is catchable anymore
[3:30:08] BruceleeDK: What's also crazy is that it was overnight, if we look at past tourney's with rogue nerfs it took months
[3:30:58] sunileif: i still dont buy that one
[3:31:12] sunileif: "oopps we forggot to nerf"
[3:31:16] sunileif: ya right

[3:35:35] sunileif: i mean i have run into the immortal bdk in ashran
[3:35:49] sunileif: <,<
[3:35:51] BruceleeDK: Can't nerf damage and then also add 20+ deathstrikes into your rotation instead of coils while also dying through DS spam
[3:36:07] BruceleeDK: math isn't mathing
[3:36:11] Meadamemnon: yeah same on enh too. when its strong you know its going to be nerfed. The way they balance my favorite classes, Its actually made me think I should just start playing rogue LUL
[3:36:35] biofreaks: ewww SOD

[3:49:50] Anhak: your 50% average in wow pvp
[3:49:53] Anhak: is like 1700

[5:26:13] buffevoker: Is there a way just to see Totem Names but not all pet shit etc in arena
[5:27:38] Vendrek: I might level my lvl 5 rogue...how long the phases in SoD were taking put me off a lot and thought about quiting it
[5:27:52] buffevoker: Like in shuffle its insane if theres dk demo lock and bm hunter LUL
[5:28:17] Vendrek: Thats my point...the phases are too long
[5:28:51] krome2dadome: sod is the definition of casual
[5:29:02] Vendrek: I could level 1-25 in a single day...25-40 is about the same time commitment
[5:31:54] Vendrek: Oh no...someone that knows what they are doing 25-40 is pretty fast
[5:32:20] Vendrek: Above 40 is a much larger time sink
[5:34:05] waitimdesyncd: been like that for years now in EU at least

[5:34:28] nikthevoker: its non stop
[5:34:34] waitimdesyncd: people sell gold in youtube ads too
[5:35:28] waitimdesyncd: well they have done some gigantic back-end work and front end work and done stuff with the client that real companies cant do. So they have a product they want to get out there
[5:35:47] waitimdesyncd: they never nibbed it in the butt so nows its huge and too late
[5:36:08] waitimdesyncd: its more like PoE in WoW
[5:38:16] waitimdesyncd: yeah but if you havent actually played ascension you dont really know what were talking about fully
[5:38:33] waitimdesyncd: it isnt a WoW-private server, they have modified the client so much
[5:38:50] waitimdesyncd: yeah 100%
[5:39:05] waitimdesyncd: Yeah, BUT, the code
[5:39:14] waitimdesyncd: pixels are the same, but the code is so complex
[5:39:32] belvedee: Blizzard could go after them for copyright infringement for individual assets that they stole
[5:39:36] waitimdesyncd: Yeah they have a lot
[5:39:55] waitimdesyncd: Yeah they solved cross faction years before Blizz did
[5:40:10] waitimdesyncd: You say that, but then you see what they have done in it
[5:40:17] waitimdesyncd: They have made the client a sandbox
[5:40:26] waitimdesyncd: its not just asset flipping, or meshes
[5:40:46] waitimdesyncd: They have retail expansion levels of UI
[5:40:56] thepartyzone: when’s next awc match
[5:41:00] waitimdesyncd: there are nobody in the world that does it like ascension, thats what keeps it alive

[5:41:54] stuart805: @notmes yo question with no context.... what should i main for phase 2. mage boomkin or lock?
[5:42:11] waitimdesyncd: I think youd have to see it to believe it
[5:42:13] nikthevoker: viper is insane
[5:42:25] waitimdesyncd: Because its WoW, but its basically another game
[5:42:30] nikthevoker: 10% reduced for 10% mana every3s
[5:42:31] nikthevoker: \
[5:42:58] waitimdesyncd: Both in ui, design, netcode, engine work (making cross faction and phasing work in WoTLK)
[5:43:02] waitimdesyncd: years before classic did
[5:43:18] waitimdesyncd: Idk, Ive always felt like that had some blizzard insider that gave them some tips
[5:43:48] waitimdesyncd: they had* -- I played from the beginning and saw it switch owers twice, and the new owners from 2019 and forward have been going insane
[5:44:50] waitimdesyncd: They casually did things that Ion would go on interviews and say "you know, back then we didnt think of how the modern playerbase would feel, and so we didnt expect to prepare for cross faction", and that just repeated itself over and over
[5:45:19] waitimdesyncd: Yeah and their community manager is super happy and fun, and makes some crazy crazy good videos that lures people in, but its all just business and a company
[5:45:28] Zoortha: !addon
[5:45:54] TheBackstabi: WotLK client modding has been going insane in the last few years
[5:46:04] waitimdesyncd: Blizzard could only dream of having the ascension guys expertise with the WotLK 3.3.5 client
[5:46:16] waitimdesyncd: big true
[5:46:18] TheBackstabi: They've essentially completely cracked it open, it's a pretty simple process to implement any model, even fully custom ones
[5:46:31] waitimdesyncd: cs is modding taken commercial  proven right
[5:46:37] TheBackstabi: Another server using those tools but still in development is Project Epoch
[5:46:56] waitimdesyncd: LUL
[5:47:24] waitimdesyncd: ascension is making probably 100ks each month easily from cryptobros that spend 2000-10k there a month on QoL and status LUL
[5:48:27] waitimdesyncd: hs and battlegrounds keep all my casual friends engaged steadily
[5:49:04] waitimdesyncd: too big for their own good in that way
[5:50:43] waitimdesyncd: yeah overwatch was fun on the free weekends but I never bought it
[5:50:53] Omgdoom: overwatch sold 50 million copies, what
[5:51:20] waitimdesyncd: @Omgdoom whats 50m short term vs 100m long term
[5:51:28] waitimdesyncd: or 1b long term
[5:52:21] LokixSun: when games like candy crush makes more money than elder rings, the state of gaming has changed
[5:55:29] waitimdesyncd: TF2 had the cinematics about the characters that OW borrowed heavily from
[5:55:29] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:56:02] waitimdesyncd: Yeah
[5:56:22] waitimdesyncd: yup
[5:56:45] Omgdoom: this is extreme revionist history tho. overwatch is the tenth best selling game in history. saying yeah but they could have made more money by releasing a game that sold 50 million copies when f2p wasnt the model is kinda nuts
[5:57:07] Omgdoom: blizzard made a massive mistake letting valve steal dota, thats something that was obvious at the time
[5:57:17] waitimdesyncd: yeah its its dead now
[5:58:14] waitimdesyncd: its not revisionist to say that in hindsight OW did nowhere near as good as it could have. yeah it was big at first, but they blundered and lost the lane to val
[5:59:11] waitimdesyncd: OW having a price also spawned clones like Paladins etc etc
[5:59:23] Anhak: they blundered before val they blundered when the community was asking for 1 thing and they kept during balance and design around OWL which was failing hard
[6:00:13] Anhak: OWL was bleeding money
[6:00:19] Anhak: omega hard bleeding money
[6:01:10] waitimdesyncd: they already do it with WoW. WoW follows the CoD model. They cant have multiple games (3) running that model, it would be weak
[6:02:20] waitimdesyncd: people were dying to develop dota with a real company and nobody gave a crap until it was too late
[6:02:46] TheBackstabi: HoN is the main one that comes to mind for further pushing the genre
[6:02:51] TheBackstabi: Early on*
[6:04:10] TheBackstabi: Apparently LoL was just before HoN
[6:04:19] waitimdesyncd: HoTs ended up being my favorite Moba but my friends hated it
[6:05:32] waitimdesyncd: Playing WoW characters were so fun to me
