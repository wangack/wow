[1:42:59] thebigdongerhere: Its true they get used to it
[1:43:00] salibazap: That's because when you need glasses but dont use it, you keep forcing your eyes, like when you want to see far away and you kinda start using it. So your eyes starting to relax
[1:43:06] cryoticred: are you doing premades?
[1:43:09] errbodyeats: glasses make you weak
[1:43:10] romani_aurion: Your eyes need to relax, you‚Äôre straining them without glasses

[2:03:29] insaniacc_: @Savix apparently crowdpummeler on-use effect stays even if you change weapons LULW Sounds like you might have to steal it so you can use it on cd and swap to your normal weapon LULW
[2:03:37] Deadge_Gartic: @Naboo69 i dont think they designed paladin dps originally , feels like more of a support class
[2:03:40] toyfriend: thats what he gets for playing dw shaman

[2:05:17] kcfz: GIGA
[2:05:25] Naboo69: @Deadge_Gartic classic pala is literally just a buff bot, heavily hit by hybrid tax, but if blizz make set bonuses specifcally for ret at max lvl, you could alleviate some of the problem
[2:05:34] Krex0r: WHy it felt bad? :P

[2:06:40] mollymangomoog: give warlocks demonic circle damn it

[2:06:44] Naboo69: @Deadge_Gartic You need a different game than classic for something other than a bandaid fix though
[2:06:44] fillway: what is that fairy goblin thing with the blue turn in
[2:06:50] Qwertz22: @Savix did you see the class changes for next week?

[3:36:58] Steeveee: lost ark had teh MVP

[4:41:37] Hotform: leveling doesnt matter in retail its done in 1 day right now
[4:41:40] Felmeme: people just get boosted in azure span to 70 in 2 hours anyway
[4:41:41] rikoswauvey: Nobody will ever do it, everyone just does the meta of the fastest way to max
[4:41:47] Honorbringer_: The newest expansion should honestly be the first starting zone, because retail is not about leveling anymore
[4:41:48] Hotform: they should make prestige leveling where you can level multiple times
[4:41:48] 6all: @Savix wow 2 with whole new team..WHOLE NEW
[4:41:49] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix tbh most retail players doesnt enjoy leveling in the beginning

[4:42:02] KosunaKoizumi: Retail is dead and unredeemable
[4:42:03] fallendarkone220: the problem is in us "we" as comunity just wanna spam mplus first week kill hc raid and say game is boring and leave it until next patch
[4:42:03] Alter_Nick: @DMGlol he's a grammar nazi. on twitch no less. his opinions are meaningless
[4:42:03] fewme: retail leveling should have a loremaster explaining shit and leading the way for new players so they understand the lore
[4:42:04] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix sir hold that never see anyone part is cuz of sharding
[4:42:05] temp3st98: yeah leveling in an mmo is important otherwise its just gonna get boring fast
[4:42:06] Turbonerd_TV: they should start on wow 2 instead of working on retail. Keep investing in sod and put the other resources into wow 2
[4:42:11] bakingbad: retail is dungeons + raid nothing else
[4:42:12] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix its like layering but a bit more complex

[4:42:55] KosunaKoizumi: @KosunaKoizumi shit eater take
[4:42:57] dabloom: leveling is the best
[4:42:59] Slyz777: I love it, the interactions between players and the w pvp
[4:43:10] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix sir retail has sharding , its a bit more complex then layering. Its more like personal layer ish with extremely limited amount of players
[4:43:11] GrandmasCloset: @KosunaKoizumi one button rotation 38 year old dad take
[4:43:14] jonesyss8: just leveled a horde char for the BFA campaign mount, had a blast

[4:43:20] 7thSaga: i only play 1 character so you may know my feels for leveling LUl
[4:43:24] MakeASplash: leveling in classic just feels right
[4:43:25] Joryckfree: 10% of people maybe level normally in classic others just boost through
[4:43:28] Alis_yazuki: savix ppl are fighting in chat Saddies
[4:43:50] Deadge_Gartic: at this point i'm just boosting a character each xpac LULW
[4:43:51] aoe_enjoyer: ReallyMad
[4:43:56] temp3st98: bro you can get to lvl 70 within 1 day
[4:43:58] veiloflonelystars: classic lvling is the only lvling that matters lets be honest
[4:43:58] ostring: aaaa fight
[4:44:06] aoe_enjoyer: that was fun!
[4:44:06] phallanxtty: @Alis_yazuki LULW
[4:44:11] definitely_not_sure: idk how new players make it to max level, honestly
[4:44:18] Deadge_Gartic: @definitely_not_sure they dont
[4:44:21] salibazap: retail leveling is completely useless, just an annoying experience.
[4:44:26] Deadge_Gartic: @definitely_not_sure i have a irl friend who quit recently
[4:44:31] Deadge_Gartic: without reaching even 50
[4:44:32] veiloflonelystars: retail lvling experience should just be doing some random missions pve, no quests
[4:44:35] CitrusCatChise: Classic leveling is slow and grueling yet rewarding. Retail is fast and linear and a race to max level to farm the same stuff over and over
[4:44:37] KappaLordXD: Clueless he was just shy
[4:44:39] 7thSaga: any boosting in classic?
[4:44:50] RTuix: retail is an instance simulator lol never in the open world just in dungeons raids arena and bgs
[4:44:54] 7thSaga: BFA Jaina :(
[4:44:56] Deadge_Gartic: tbh i hate classic leveling too LULW its not just retail leveling for me
[4:44:58] temp3st98: it's because chromie time makes leveling really empty @Savix
[4:44:59] Deadge_Gartic: i dont like leveling in general
[4:45:05] GrandmasCloset: @RTuix wrong
[4:45:08] beannator: it was warcraft 3 frozen throne
[4:45:08] shinra40: hell most ppl dont if they dont know WC2
[4:45:18] YlaWoW: Yeah the world is honestly really cool
[4:45:20] DekRemzD: Didn't he say he played WC3? It explains how Jaina murdered her own father
[4:45:22] Dacoolface: If you level the meta route, which is Draenor, you see lots of peeps. Not a lot of communication still, though.
[4:45:34] mariefredx: you can get AB rep with coins from bloodmoon :o
[4:45:37] Alis_yazuki: @Deadge_Gartic i liked leveling in mop the 85-90 push was very relaxing i didnt mind doing it on multiple characters maybe because the story was really fun
[4:45:41] lasershark1: om
[4:45:45] Joryckfree: Dont get me wrong I LOVE  LEVELING, and i was playing wow classic very actively and everyone around just boosted through everything and that really made me feel depressed
[4:45:46] salibazap: also retail feels empty because other people and groups only slow you down, you're the chosen one anyway
[4:45:55] RTuix: @RTuix ok
[4:46:06] Deadge_Gartic: @Alis_yazuki i think the xpac release levelings are fine like the 5 to 10 levels exploring new stuff etc
[4:46:12] 7thSaga: :( the memories of savix dc
[4:46:12] Deadge_Gartic: but problem is game is 20 y.o LULW

[4:46:23] GrandmasCloset: @RTuix try rp server or world pvp dragonm isles
[4:46:29] DMGlol: BFA actually does have a good questing experience
[4:46:48] Deadge_Gartic: @DMGlol true tbh and zone stories arent that bad
[4:46:48] the_bronze_yasuo: om
[4:46:50] DMGlol: But the xp scalimg does fuck it
[4:46:54] Mokuof300: don't let this distract you from the fact that savix never watched tokyo drift
[4:46:55] Deadge_Gartic: bfa had endgame problem
[4:46:56] shinra40: its a nice outfit
[4:46:58] Qeevdo: you can mog grays now pogg

[4:47:22] GrandmasCloset: loll
[4:47:28] KosunaKoizumi: I bet Retail enjoyers also love D4
[4:47:29] veiloflonelystars: retail new player experience is trash
[4:47:42] brownfiesta: WoW killes off all the main characters
[4:47:54] tummboi: dragonflight was fun
[4:47:54] Estu90: dragonflight had overwhelmingly old characters tho
[4:47:56] definitely_not_sure: FFXIV also takes the time to introduce a character to the player
[4:48:02] Deadge_Gartic: df questing was meh for me
[4:48:04] GrandmasCloset: imagine being a new player now imagine being a new pvper quing into a 1200 arean against pikaboo
[4:48:05] Deadge_Gartic: lore wasnt interesting
[4:48:06] Diamsofer: nope
[4:48:07] BelvethBahceli: walking simulator
[4:48:08] Deadge_Gartic: he said he didnt
[4:48:08] Tehghost66512: my least favorite part of retail is the extreme level of gatekeeping
[4:48:10] JonasDM_HS: no
[4:48:11] insaniacc_: he didnt
[4:48:13] xarnac: Nah he said he quit at 62
[4:48:14] GrandmasCloset: needing 4 adoons just to stand a chance
[4:48:14] salibazap: he didnt
[4:48:15] insaniacc_: he said it was too boring to play alone
[4:48:17] tylerificus: dragonflight didnt feel like wow to me but it was still fun
[4:48:25] chatisonfire: payoOld
[4:48:29] minimusmax_: DF was good, but it is a very sudden change compared to BFA for sure
[4:48:38] aoe_enjoyer: its been a lot of fun
[4:48:56] temp3st98: Jamgie osrs music
[4:49:00] Hoshma46: I got 12/13 classes to max
[4:49:05] KaizeeRx: COPIUMTRUCK
[4:49:10] Turbonerd_TV: actually it does
[4:49:13] GrandmasCloset: classic will always be second scraps this is the ahr d truth
[4:49:13] the_bronze_yasuo: wrath BASED
[4:49:18] GrandmasCloset: an afterthought
[4:49:24] DekRemzD: I'm enjoying SoD but it shares a lot of the complaints he has with Wrath/Retail. Power creep through runes and BFD gear makes the world feel "too safe"
[4:49:38] Meddlok: I was new and chose SoD. fully addicted.
[4:49:38] Estu90: areas which has never been explored, so he means a new xpac? some things doesnt add up in logic, but i agree SoD is an awesome start for a new player
[4:49:46] Mokuof300: savix was once a pvper
[4:49:46] KaizeeRx: There are alot of people playing retail juh
[4:49:55] Camrock__: yep i tried HC like a year ago and hated it and now i tried again when P2 started and im hooooked
[4:49:56] DMGlol: Yea SoD is solid so far, super casual and fun
