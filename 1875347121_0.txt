[2:34:13] Sqwabbles: yes
[2:34:17] TsoSai: I finally got all my conquest for a full set of PVP conquest gear
[2:34:20] gotcha2157: Wotlk naxx
[2:34:25] ranef3: yes you can get the old tier 3, google a guide for it, its complicated
[2:34:42] Linder8260: @Swifty just get to the black market.
[2:34:43] Wendigo567: @swifty I’m starting a business of my own. I’m going to be making custom hat wear and shirt wear.
[2:34:59] Antero94: I want to get the Dreadnought set on my warrior, but the mats are crazy expensive, like 2.8M gold total
[2:35:22] Linder8260: @Antero94 are there mats now ?
[2:35:25] nolifeAlice: wotlk naxx is so easy, you can beat it in leveling greens LUL
[2:35:42] Linder8260: @Antero94 i have an account where i have around 2.5 mil on and i dont play anymore lUL
[2:35:49] kostchie: Not worth my time. I also do not have the gold to spend on T#
[2:35:53] kostchie: 3
[2:36:24] Spalken: leveling greens might push it, but questing dungeon blues should be enough

[2:37:32] DeadxWoW: boom deleted
[2:37:49] Antero94: @Linder8260 You can unlock old scholomance, and then a portal to wotlk Naxx where there is a vendor that sells items that have a chance to turn into the old T3 gear. However you need to use some crazy expensive mats to purify the pieces u get in order to use them
[2:38:21] TsoSai: can you macro a target at self binding shop as well?
[2:38:34] TsoSai: Binding shot*
[2:38:46] Antero94: It is only for transmog for those who are interested in that
[2:38:57] Linder8260: @Antero94 ohhh ... stupid.. they ruin the game
[2:39:40] Linder8260: so now if you are rich or if you buy tokens you can get the most and the only transmog that makes you visable in the game... to others
[2:39:53] Antero94: @Linder8260 No doubt set up in such a way that encourages people to buy wow tokens to get enough gold
[2:40:00] Linder8260: I kinda smell a P2W HERE?
[2:40:11] Linder8260: @Antero94 Ofc.. its blizzard.
[2:40:20] DeadxWoW: bm has that talent too
[2:40:25] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[2:41:00] kostchie: Ruined the game??? It will take months for people to get the pieces and millions of gold in mats to acquire the complete set. It will be better to farm the BMAH for the sets than farm Naxx for the sets.
[2:41:38] Linder8260: @kostchie THEY RUINED THE GAME...
[2:41:59] Linder8260: the ONLY THING THAT MADE you "unique" was a full set of tier 3 cus it WAS SO HARD TO OBTAIN
[2:42:11] Linder8260: you legit HAD A MAFIA OF PEOPLE SNIPING IT AROUND THE SERVERS
[2:42:21] kostchie: The game was ruined long ago.
[2:42:24] Linder8260: and you have to have 20 diffents chars SPREAD ACROSS TO OBTAIN IT.
[2:42:37] Linder8260: that was dedication

[2:45:04] kostchie: Before this latest patch. The people who wanted T3 spent time farming the BMAH. One will spend probably the same amount of time farming Naxx weekly to acquire the entire set of T3.
