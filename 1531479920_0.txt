[1:14:31] Gingerprimer: But we are not even  in a drought IMO
[1:14:36] warrenny: @allkindapillzzz Dragonflight alpha next expac not beta for classic
[1:14:38] strchsr: @Towelliee How many paladins do you have haha
[1:14:41] Lincoln_WoW: i don't think that's fun lol
[1:14:44] Streamcrush: is twitter down?
[1:14:48] Zivs: @SethLan maybe, but it would be even more weird to let one suffer because the other is doing theirs
[1:14:49] KaptnG: @towelliee do you really think DF will launch this year?
[1:14:52] Odinslayer: yea twitter down
[1:14:55] BlinkHeals: @towelliee i wasnt saying it as a bad thing. just stating what it was. definately better than farming a boss for a heirloom
[1:14:57] HaloS23: test... so odd! dont know why the badges had me at "watching without audio
[1:15:04] Mr_Pennywise_: towOny
[1:15:04] FewdewTwitch: You cant pull every mob into the iron star
[1:15:05] Streamcrush: ok thanks
[1:15:06] Eregbueye: @Towelliee do you do any sport nowadays dude ?
[1:15:09] Odinslayer: no issues towCopium
[1:15:14] ShrenTheOrc: do you think they will do a battle pass soon tm
[1:15:18] mrsuflakis: they shouls also br8ng old systems back like corruption
[1:15:21] AllKindaPillZzz: @warrenny Ohhhh ok. Thank you! so there is no beta for DF?
[1:15:22] SethLan: How come we dont have BOOST XP in TBC yet?
[1:15:30] lucid_wow: i think they would just nerf the iron stars into the ground they wouldnt make it not give % imo
[1:15:32] teatimetox: theres a aoe cap I thought
[1:15:33] mmo_kenna_: hammers up, we finally seeing alpha today?
[1:15:37] Redpandalol: @towelliee guardian is gonna be op for mobility
[1:15:37] itsEllySaurus: @Towelliee u ever play magic the gathering?
[1:15:38] Murphybrown: can't wait to see LFR fated
[1:15:39] raye_gaming22: it shouldahve a cap
[1:15:41] nephttv_: could also target cap the iron star
[1:15:43] FewdewTwitch: The iron star has a cap
[1:15:46] doomester: @Towelliee i hope in Dragonflight they remove Tier sets so we can play our alts without any draw backs
[1:15:49] xantizz1: Alpha today.
[1:15:50] almostdps: iron star is capped
[1:15:50] strchsr: @Towelliee AoE cap for the Iron Star lol
[1:15:52] timbyz: Well they cant do that tho. Because then we've got a problem of dungeons becoming incompletable
[1:15:52] xantizz1: ?
[1:15:57] nephttv_: just make it hard capped at 8 or something
[1:15:57] FewdewTwitch: Not working on mobs not belonging to that area I believe
[1:15:59] lucid_wow: like it would probably be like when they nerfed plagueborers into the ground after echo TGP strat
[1:16:04] timbyz: But aoe cap might be a solution imo
[1:16:04] Boosti661: They probably already thought about when selecting it

[1:16:13] RoboMaximillion: ?
[1:16:13] KeidooTV: hahahaah
[1:16:14] AnotherCheche: @doomester ????????????
[1:16:18] lucid_wow: KEKW
[1:16:21] woknarf: Weird take
[1:16:22] teatimetox: liquid maximum did a key recently and the star affected 5 targets
[1:16:23] RoboMaximillion: one guy
[1:16:25] 4head_4weird: KEKW
[1:16:25] Stonefather: Looking at the concept art for Dragonflight please keep them
[1:16:26] NotEnoughMana: its not that hard to get tier sets right now dude
[1:16:27] AnotherCheche: tiersets i one of the best things for class identity
[1:16:30] Vaedrun: true
[1:16:31] AllKindaPillZzz: @Towelliee Do you think they need more weapons?
[1:16:32] Metket: people are poor KEKW
[1:16:32] jones9: Ban that guy
[1:16:33] Bigdan2140: I agree i hate the fact i have to play the game to get gear :( thats cringe ahhaha
[1:16:33] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Aspect Catalyst in DF for sure LOL
[1:16:36] raye_gaming22: i have 25 charges on my catalyst kekw
[1:16:37] Metket: korthia farmers KEKW
[1:16:37] warrenny: #bad take tier is great
[1:16:37] datcreepa: freezing cold take
[1:16:38] Shatraugh: Theres always that one guy
[1:16:39] Kellorian: I like it a lot
[1:16:40] francescothepainter: kinda sus take ngl
[1:16:41] Lataran: havent played what does this catalyst do?
[1:16:42] Ariea_Whisper: Yup this is def Aphla/beta chat this morning lol
[1:16:42] lucid_wow: hard WeirdChamp take
[1:16:43] szble: people wanted them back and then immediately complained
[1:16:44] AnotherCheche: LOL
[1:16:45] bigoldmeatpie: all of my alts have 4pc and i don't raid or do M+ on them. bro what do you mean
[1:16:46] BelllGoR: they did have some rough sets though
[1:16:47] Velashen: Yeah .. we need more of that. Not less.
[1:16:49] BuzzCutBronson: only issue with catalyst is how late into tier it came out
[1:16:53] GamertagTIKI: only thing is cosmic flux should have been acct wide from the start
[1:16:54] JansonLives: I've got 4 piece on like 5 toons. Most of those I've not even played in more than a month.
[1:16:57] Stonefather: The tier set concept art in Dragonflight is subjectively a win across the board for all classes.
[1:17:01] zeitgeiz: Have had 4-set on like 10 alts for a long time
[1:17:01] doomester: @Towelliee im 11/11 Mythic with 4alts
[1:17:01] amkttv: If tier sets were to go, would we get Azerite armor again or something?
[1:17:03] warrenny: @xxamoi A month?
[1:17:07] almostdps: @Xxamoi if it came out earlier, it completely negates the raid
[1:17:12] doomester: the issue is if you are alt aholic
[1:17:15] AnotherCheche: ive never heard anyone complain about not wanting tiersets before
[1:17:15] Nevindaz: KEKW
[1:17:15] trashedskeletor: LMFAO THD IS SUCH A TROLL
[1:17:16] timbyz: THD wants everyone to be miserable KEKW
[1:17:16] doomester: you cant do it
[1:17:19] Scoodles91: tier set can stay, but they have to make a specific pvp tier sets
[1:17:21] aikopooh: kekw
[1:17:21] BuzzCutBronson: hmm
[1:17:21] Anneris1: but tier sets are borrowed power LUL
[1:17:25] BuzzCutBronson: true fair enough
[1:17:27] Nevindaz: and Titanforging towOof
[1:17:30] Cartharon: private legion AP THD server
[1:17:31] mekatok: xmattx3Kekkw
[1:17:33] nephttv_: Give me legion AP grind back
[1:17:33] lucid_wow: cosmic flux should have been account wide at the beginning and catalyst should have been around earlier
[1:17:35] Stonefather: With seven types of AP to farm POGGERS
[1:17:36] SicariusGTV: tbf, account wide ap would be kinda nice
[1:17:37] NotEnoughMana: with a time limit too
[1:17:38] strchsr: @Towelliee I wouldn't mind more of the tier set/legendary powers being baked into talent trees -- maybe not as strong as the legendary itself but more options for different playstyles
[1:17:38] melchizadek: was there a wotlk news update or leak today yet?
[1:17:38] hikaritd: infinite grind = content. Whats good when you reach weekly cap on reset day and do nothing for 6 days? LUL
[1:17:45] PadidinJones: @Towelliee welcome back you were missed!
[1:17:46] Metket: that lock so pathatic
[1:17:47] Selkie08: He is just doing it because he likes the attention at this point LUL
[1:17:50] warrenny: @thd has a point legion ap was cool
[1:17:58] szble: grinds are find they just have to be more forgiving
[1:17:59] wraaith: thd still does islands for fun now right ?
[1:18:07] coronnieflex: send him back to the infinite maw of souls grind
[1:18:07] hikaritd: then the "average people" stay less strong, EZ
[1:18:07] generaljosh721: Degenerate Island
[1:18:09] ScalarGaming: grind is fine, just make it accountbound
[1:18:16] Miklagart: hello
[1:18:17] cajunw33dh3ad: Tier sets is still technically borrowed power
[1:18:19] BuzzCutBronson: i dont have that time but id still love a grind
[1:18:22] jamtlandswe: what time is the prediction for alpha, before lunch or after?
[1:18:28] AllKindaPillZzz: @Towelliee I think they are doing a great job trying to make the game balanced for all type of players.
[1:18:36] geokouts: Make ZM give 280 gear :P
[1:18:38] hikaritd: 9am pst
[1:18:38] darssia_: annassae subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:18:40] ChrisStoll: Zerith Mortis was great for me coming back to the game. Quick gearing 3 characters and had some fun with mounts / pets
[1:18:42] almostdps: i mean when i didnt raid early 9.2 it gave my main full 252
[1:18:45] Stonefather: Technically true
[1:18:48] Velashen: I don’t have time for grinds.. that said if you made it account bound I’d be fine with it.
[1:18:48] WoWRoach: Zerith Mortis was great for those of us that don't do high level keys or raids.
[1:18:51] Stonefather: But it's the evil we know and love.
[1:18:53] Ceolas: Weird, I thought ZM was great with rewards
[1:18:56] Anneris1: zereth mortis is painful if you are mount collector like me, reputation for paragon chests went too slow
[1:18:59] timbyz: They're borrowed power ''technically'' But they are a staple of the game
[1:18:59] procyon_mfc: TM is helping me gear up my alt after taking a year hiatus
[1:19:04] Gr3atAp3: the thing with tier sets is you dont lose them until you replace them with something better
[1:19:04] Bigdan2140: Tier sets are in a different situation because we get it every tier and its not some giga grind like AP was to get
[1:19:05] Vaedrun: all gear is borrowed power
[1:19:06] vadermug: and the break was the worst feeling system of all
[1:19:13] raye_gaming22: i take ZM over the aids that was the maw week 1-2 in progress were we logged off and on to reset the jailors eye
[1:19:13] Molvonos: Not all borrowed power is bad.
[1:19:28] warrenny: @vadermug True
[1:19:28] AllKindaPillZzz: @Ceolas Me too, was a fun idea and kept players together
[1:19:31] strchsr: @Towelliee I think we didn't have tier sets in BfA because we already had the Heart of Azeroth + Essences + Azerite Gear + Corruptions, etc.
[1:19:31] Aquadriel: the concept of getting a bonus set is just fun
[1:19:32] mario_banshee: Twitter fixed? Is loading again for me.
[1:19:33] raye_gaming22: if isee  shit like that ever again i quit for sure
[1:19:35] Eregbueye: power, that comes from the gear is fine
[1:19:41] warrenny: @vadermug i like bfa but azerite was meh
[1:19:42] lucid_wow: tier sets are technically borrowed power but theyre also borrowed power thats been there since vanilla and some borrowed power can be good as long as it sticks around even in the way tier sets have stuck around
[1:19:44] Layliah79: wish we could keep Soul Shapes
[1:19:55] Athaeln: Well not every grind is rewarding, imo Legions Artifact weapon was way more rewarding than Azerite
[1:19:55] ChrisMFCook: I would t say borrowed power, but a reward for doing the content.
[1:19:56] trashedskeletor: i cant wait to go back to CN
[1:19:57] almostdps: Is healing borrowed power? you wouldnt be alive to dps if the healer didnt heal you right?
[1:20:00] NickyNiclas: Twitter is back :)
[1:20:00] PvtHudson093: still didnt say if legendaries can be upgraded one last time in S4
[1:20:01] KAHVITEK: I hope its loot season all over.
[1:20:15] Layliah79: Legendaries aren't getting upgraded again
[1:20:22] Beave_86: for the fated raids is there only 1 difficulty?
[1:20:29] strchsr: @Layliah79 Better turn them into a toy or continue to be usable in rested areas, I didn't collect 73 of them to not keep my class fantasy aaa
[1:20:33] vadermug: bfa had cool zones but azerite gear was gross
[1:20:36] Tecni: how was your 2 days off?
[1:20:37] BuzzCutBronson: @Beave_86 no all 3
[1:20:44] PvtHudson093: that trinket is dogshit
[1:20:45] Stonefather: It failed miserably 🙂 But I do miss Twilight Devastation danSad
[1:20:47] Anneris1: scars is trash
[1:20:49] lucid_wow: @strchsr imagine needing to farm tier pieces on azerite slots with ur bis azerite traits and then also farm essences and AP and full corruption that sounds awful
[1:21:00] Layliah79: @strchsr It's weird how there were no achievements in SL for collecting them. that should of been our sign :(
[1:21:17] Janigiv: @Towelliee corruption was fun
[1:21:22] Layliah79: Go back to the 1 legendary only!
[1:21:22] Mecabeast: the domination sockets would have been better if you could have gotten them from all content
[1:21:22] strchsr: @strchsr Don't give them ideas to increase played time
[1:21:23] lucid_wow: man maybe a hot take but i think corruption was actually very cool for pve after the vendor came in but i think it should also have never been added to pvp
[1:21:25] Zivs: Legendaries haven't been very legendary except for the Bow and the Argus trinket
[1:21:27] Kisswani: Hey said no " SL or legion style legendaries "
[1:21:31] Reckless_Monk: yea, liked that kinda lego
[1:21:33] Mr_Pennywise_: towCopium
[1:21:35] PvtHudson093: Blizz made Jailer loot so bad tho no one wanted to kill him more than once
[1:21:36] Onisekai: i liked the mop and wod legys
[1:21:40] XarkoLP: just bring back the old legion legendary system. What was fun Kappa
[1:21:40] Layliah79: Yes those legendaries I liked!
[1:21:42] trashedskeletor: i loved mop/wod leggo output a lot
[1:21:46] Janigiv: COPIUM
[1:21:49] R2RHIN0: I enjoyed that. Made me run mythics every week for he upgrade
[1:21:58] Layliah79: Meaningful legendary!
[1:22:02] Smalltalk_SLR: So Towelliee, what expansion in your opinion will DF most likely mimic as far as gameplay goes?
[1:22:06] generaljosh721: My only issue with legendaries is that they didn't feel legendary
[1:22:08] Shinideakon: "all these voids you can fill", thats what she said
[1:22:08] AnotherCheche: challenge mode weapons PLEASE BLIZZARD
[1:22:08] marlamin: give me a dragonflight themed torghast >:(
[1:22:09] strchsr: @Layliah79 It's probably just going to be usable outside of DF areas and maybe in rested areas. There's no real reason to not keep it, just disable it in current dungeons/PvP/raid or something
[1:22:10] stjon13: I'd be fine w/ increasing power inside raids week to week but keep outside world more dangerous
[1:22:11] Metket: void! velen coming KEKW
[1:22:15] Kisswani: towCopium Clap
[1:22:17] Velashen: Yeah. They need to straight up steal the relic weapon idea from FF14. It’s great content.
[1:22:19] raye_gaming22: @PvtHudson093 wrong no good guild ever kileld him untill all had 4 piece
[1:22:21] Nevindaz: I think that some classes will be again too op and some not so good..
[1:22:28] jure__: overdosing... somebody bring out the narcan
[1:22:29] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The New Professions Systems are Game Changing! - New Dragonflight News youtu.be/iCiv-0Pvu20
[1:22:31] belaham: need all the copium
[1:22:38] Wigglynuts1: im scared that they will add some crap like the maw again
[1:22:39] Nevindaz: like the rogues/druids..
[1:22:40] Layliah79: @strchsr that would be nice!!! esp since some drop in timewalking still!
[1:22:42] lucid_wow: i would love to see more legendaries like the old days with stuff like thunderfury atiesh shadowmourne fangs of the father etc, it feels way more meaningful and actually legendary to do something to actually obtain it without it being a staple of the patch (like the cloak in 8.3 or the leggos in SL)
[1:22:46] Stonefather: Inhaling so much COPIUM at this rate we're going to need a new delivery system the aerosol isn't powerful enough
[1:22:50] Sephirothxz: I hope they will not make legendary for everyone again. Just make 1 legendary obtainable trough raid like it was in the past.
[1:22:50] Odinslayer: towCopium towCopium
[1:22:54] Eregbueye: well ZM mount farm is exactly that isnt it
[1:22:59] Joneeeez: I really hope we get some cool mounts in Dragonflight, shaodowlands mounts was okey I guess
[1:23:02] Layliah79: towCopium
[1:23:05] kranztheman: Beyond, normal,heroic, and mythic...how are you doing this raid multiple times?
[1:23:09] geokouts: IF Towelliee dont get an Alpha access we must gather outside Blizz HQ to protest!
[1:23:23] kranztheman: different  character nvm. just saw. XD
[1:23:23] warrenny: @lucid_wow Questline sure 1 person in cuild no
[1:23:23] RPClipsGTA: mount this time
[1:23:26] teatimetox: something that doesnt make me want to pluck my eyes out with a spoon
[1:23:27] RPClipsGTA: THIS IS THE TIME
[1:23:28] cabalish: community focus
[1:23:30] szble: wow thats a first
[1:23:32] Gingerprimer: @kranztheman lfr
[1:23:33] SyWr: thats the theory but do you believe it?
[1:23:34] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: Kapp
[1:23:36] Thoreya: max was saying all the class devs were in his streams when they were discussing talents
[1:23:38] seabass82: yeah...sure
[1:23:40] srs_business: There always going to be tuning issues. I'm more worried about class design
[1:23:41] 4head_4weird: Kappa
[1:23:44] lucid_wow: @kranztheman lfr normal heroic and mythic are all different lockouts and can all drop the mount so u get 4 attempts per character
[1:23:45] maxkule: like a Community Council?
[1:23:47] inzightzz: surely this time they will listen to feedback Kappa
[1:23:49] jmalmin: They are already changing hunter talents without anyone testing them really.
[1:23:51] Aquadriel: copium
[1:23:52] soopaGreg: too much copium ...
[1:23:57] kranztheman: @Gingerprimer thanks :)
[1:24:02] Metket: survival + desto doing x10 damage then anyone nice feedback listening
[1:24:04] Thoreya: max was saying yesterday all the class devs were in his streams when they were discussing talents
[1:24:12] RPClipsGTA: i hope the evoker class is op and broken like the dk's at the beginning of wotlk
[1:24:13] Wigglynuts1: ive been seeing the rogue dev talking every day in the rogue discord
[1:24:17] Heuwzen: I'm so nervous about Warrior Talents
[1:24:20] raye_gaming22: the hunter dude for sure does work
[1:24:25] KaisenSiru: True

[1:24:32] Thoreya: they already announched theyre changing mm and surv stuff
[1:24:34] raye_gaming22: he changed like 5 talents by now
[1:24:37] srs_business: Survival single target build KEKWlaugh
[1:24:42] Nevindaz: yreah KEKW
[1:24:43] Syghtless: they have already made two posts abotu changes to hunter tree @Towelliee
[1:24:43] Akilies12: they already did that with the hunter tree, he said he's moving some abilities in the bottom row to another row
[1:24:44] belaham: towCopium towTinfoil
[1:24:45] DoubleNova: surely Kappa
[1:24:48] Layliah79: no way they will let Bear be OP Dx

[1:25:54] RPClipsGTA: here comes the mount
[1:26:06] Mitune: I swear the hHunter designers are the most active ones LUL
[1:26:26] marlamin: they'll probably hotfix stuff pretty quickly instead of waiting for the weekly build too i expect
[1:26:36] cajunw33dh3ad: Alpha!
[1:26:38] maxkule: @Towelliee How long will the video be that your releasing?
[1:26:40] RPClipsGTA: damn
[1:26:43] lucid_wow: i feel like frost dk has the most ideal tree setup personally, it feels pretty good that u can just go hard left and get everything u want for single target or go hard right and get everything u want for aoe/cleave but idk maybe thats an unpopular opinion lol
[1:26:47] strchsr: @Towelliee Galactic Guardian enjoyer: "Is this the 5 o'clock free crack giveaway?"

[3:34:58] DogShep: Although updated to  10.0.0.44645 this morning.... but still encrypted :(
[3:34:59] Xailen: Datamining owned by Blizz, they say when it can be done.
[3:34:59] Atem___: maybe Blizz's encryption is getting better lol
[3:35:03] Poriand: i hope theres alpha and not just youtube recordings to watch
[3:35:06] geros2013: if its encrypted they say we datamined x encrypted stuff

[3:36:33] marlamin: @marlamin true
[3:36:34] Mitune: I am honestly waiting for Blizz to just make Wowhead an official Blizz own website, but thats my consipracy theory
[3:36:39] generaljosh721: @filos0phia because Blizzard is taking a harder stance on encrypting game files so it's more difficult to data mine. There's also less to datamine because a majority of it is encrypted.
[3:36:40] MacMasterful: but you have fun doing it LUL @Towelliee

[3:46:13] WayneG947: isn't it 5 zones, 4 of which match WotLK size

[5:29:59] LycanKain: I mean, that sounds like any druid spec but boomkin lol
[5:29:59] TialePetit: @Kneckt He's meaning more that dismounting and going back to dragon not automatically.

[5:30:02] CyonDru: thats how druid is
[5:30:05] sshadeh: @DubskillzTv this is more like worgen form, not like druid form
[5:30:10] paravak: I'd prefer worgen if your normal form was human and you entered worgen in combat, instead of human being just a gimmick button for RP

[5:49:48] Gh0stGamingPC: @Towelliee im sorry if it was said already but do we know how regular flying will work in dragonflight whether its achievement bound r just story bound?
[5:49:50] apollobaker: @Towelliee can you make the video fullscreen?

[5:53:17] chubahi: no need for elvui anymore..maybe . but that ui whit some WAs is gona be good i think
[5:53:18] szeeman62: @towelliee is the ui stuff completely free form or are there some presets to use for customization
[5:53:20] captiv8: did he just drink something to transform into dragonform?
[5:53:23] Steelsky_: any clue on when we'll see the rest of talents too?
[5:53:24] generaljosh721: @Towelliee sloot's account is flagged for alpha btw
[5:53:27] swaggzie_: this is terrible xd
[5:53:27] xVraigo: bnet is down
[5:53:28] JiberishUI: I hope they release more wing customizations for the Dracthyr class
[5:53:36] cooldito: mini games?? yessss
[5:53:40] Karnivor___: those are mage abilities
[5:53:44] swaggzie_: WoW is dead with this game :(
[5:53:44] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:53:48] Samerson: yeah cant get into account at all on battle net website
[5:53:50] V0lt4GE1: would pref if they changed the health bar to merge health and name together
[5:53:56] Karnivor___: @swaggzie_ why?
[5:53:59] DramaticTv: plz god take it off teh tiny screen :P
[5:54:10] Ribastur0075: content for non pvp raid mythic guys good
[5:54:11] Darrowl: new lizzard race awesome...
[5:54:11] Bertandbum: @Samerson Just had this issue but it looks like its fixed now?
[5:54:16] metalwarrior1977: Guild Wars copy/paste
[5:54:17] noobkouhai: thats nice
[5:54:31] Karnivor___: wow has always copied other games
[5:54:35] eevilwithasmile: bruh this is straight up copied from gw2, not only flying but also this timer based race
[5:54:40] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Wolrd of Warcraft: Dragon Race League, the new WoW eSport KEKW
[5:54:42] EKS90_: @metalwarrior1977 stop it, every game copies eachother.
[5:54:45] metalwarrior1977: precisily
[5:54:51] Kickack: omg
[5:54:53] infinityarty: this looks so much fun tho
[5:54:53] Xaviwan078: the tree are big its cool
[5:54:56] exilethegamer: I didnt know GW2 had the original timer based races
[5:54:56] Kickack: that's so cool
[5:55:01] vulkankragon: @Ribastur0075 dragon riding
[5:55:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: now this is pod racing
[5:55:04] karnebg: so instead of being an open world game it's just on rails now? great, much better than normal flying
[5:55:04] zenFX_: this reminds me of catching the snitch on the old ps1 harry potter game
[5:55:04] T_a_r_t_a_r_e_a_n: DRL Champion Towelliee
[5:55:06] emznev: @eevilwithasmile ye because games dont take shit from each other all the time get over it my guy
[5:55:09] procyon_mfc: @Towelliee the extra bag is indeed a regeant bag
[5:55:11] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee WoW dragon mario cart, make it happen
[5:55:11] Karnivor___: this race is for 6 year olds lets be honest
[5:55:15] flyingmachin3: Netherwing racing 2.0?
[5:55:18] Zapp_Brannigan86: getting dizzy
[5:55:21] EKS90_: @karnebg that was a race... its not on rails...
[5:55:22] cornichonouille: @karnebg not the case
[5:55:26] SphinxyOCE: love to see it
[5:55:29] vasoka1: press M so we see map
[5:55:31] exilethegamer: GW2 had the first dragon riding in gaming? insanity
[5:55:31] Hephtin: bigger then Barrens finally
[5:55:33] RagingPunk: glad to hear that
[5:55:37] Grady2385: they need to send a big fat check to GW2 lol
[5:55:39] lifetaker2424: when was the last time you played new world? its in a really good place right now
[5:55:43] Epiclurker27893: The race shows somebody plays a lot of DCUO
[5:55:46] toobaked1987: So a large highlight of Dragonflight is flying through some rings like we are playing Superman on the N64??
[5:55:46] Karnivor___: advanced course for 8 year olds
[5:55:49] Ulfinator: hopefully the animation of flying get smoother, never played gw2, but compared to this, it looks kinda weird
[5:55:56] procyon_mfc: they appear to give vigor
[5:55:56] V0lt4GE1: imagine if blizzard made a pvp dragonriding mode
[5:55:57] marshmallow110: is there a picture of the map?
[5:55:58] Xaviwan078: fin ally real big mao with big tree in azeroth
[5:56:03] JasperCalico: @PrimeNr23 you'd prob miss the first ring LUL
[5:56:04] Vanhoek: Wonder how long till they nerf the course because the baddies wont be able to complete it lol
[5:56:10] V0lt4GE1: like century: age of ashes
[5:56:11] RhadigarTV: Can we stop comparing please?
[5:56:12] BattleKnoedel: looks pretty solid for the first build of alpha
[5:56:13] procyon_mfc: u got a vigor bump when you picked up one
[5:56:16] eevilwithasmile: @emznev Ofc you copy systems, design and make them unique in some way,  but i think a direct copy and paste shows that the devs are out of ideas
[5:56:22] Deathlord_Deathvoid: Luxthos just got his download
[5:56:22] swaggzie_: I played WoW since Classic was playable threw every kind of expen'.. But I finished it with Shadowlands..  When I saw this Dragon*it .. It's seems like a big joke. @PrimeNr23   This is not that game what was before..
[5:56:25] procyon_mfc: nvm
[5:56:26] Ch0p_Su3y: Luxthos was just flagged for alpha
[5:56:28] vulkankragon: @exiledcross 1st dragon riding was in wow back in tbc when you rode the netherwing dragon
[5:56:29] procyon_mfc: hard to tell
[5:56:39] Karnivor___: @PrimeNr23 you?
[5:56:41] procyon_mfc: danF
[5:56:41] Chiraakitteh: If they didn’t have time trials, people would be demanding them. I’m sure you don’t have to do it if you don’t want
[5:56:41] emznev: @eevilwithasmile out of ideas thats the most cringe crap i have ever heard F
[5:56:42] toobaked1987: I love WoW but this shit looks targeted towards children????
[5:56:42] kiwiboneq: it gives you these diamonds
[5:56:43] drewetling: f
[5:56:43] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee datamining is happening for class stuff, mage and shaman so far
[5:56:44] manmower: is this driver's ed for dragon riding?
[5:56:48] rbgdev: f
[5:56:49] Zaxxem: lol
[5:56:49] DeanoTV: Chat if you dont like WoW gtfo why u here?
[5:56:53] Texas_Mizfit: evoker has a raid buff
[5:56:57] Zettabyte: LUL
[5:56:59] EKS90_: @eevilwithasmile and most mmos that came after wow did direct copies from wow. every game copies from eachother, and that is not a bad thing.
[5:57:02] exilethegamer: @exiledcross Oh yeah I was being sarcastic with the copy claims when every game copies another game
[5:57:05] sshadeh: you get more familiar with it over time

[5:59:29] zenFX_: @Vanhoek but when the majority of all gimmicks they've added has been good only on paper and executed poorly, it raises big concerns
[5:59:33] Lasidor: Noice, just got back from a Cruise so I am a couple days behind on information lol
[5:59:40] royalprox: so no more bartender4 is needed
[5:59:42] royalprox: ha

[6:00:06] Khaos_production: Khaos_production subscribed with Prime. 
[6:00:10] cooldito: a good step in the right direction tho
[6:00:10] MrGrimms: But @Towelliee Elvui causes FPS issues according to some guilds :D
[6:00:12] Mystikora: its good for the poeple using bartender/dominos
[6:00:12] Rudric_Ice: finally i don't need to use UI addons
[6:00:14] infinityarty: i like how minimalistic it is tho
[6:00:15] toobaked1987: You can like them all you want, thats fine, I love dragons. But the gameplay kind of looks targetted towards a YOUNG audiece. Do you really see yourself having fun riding through rings for 2 years?
[6:00:16] nilachip: same for me, elvui is the king
[6:00:16] Vanhoek: @zenFX_ Oh forsure.
[6:00:19] ShadyWizWolf: @mrpresbaby He is :)

[6:00:30] MariosMansion: Its nice for beginngers to be able to customise right from the start
[6:00:37] Subtlety_FL: This looks geared towards those that did NOT have a ui addon to give them a little more variety
[6:00:40] Dracthyr: AngelThump
[6:00:46] Kaszanic: how many bars can You have?
[6:00:47] warrenny: Im tempted to swap from elv
[6:00:52] jerseyfive: can we hide the bars?
[6:00:53] dimofodi: If I can mimick ElvUI enough, I'm good to do away with it and go more minimalist.
[6:00:55] Lexxania: depends if i can move around party/raid frames if i will switch over from elvui to their ui
[6:00:58] KerplunkGaming: towlie always makes alpha content
[6:00:58] Rexialiton: No one will see it anyway KEKW

[6:06:25] ShadyWizWolf: @DragonRydrz Alphas never have keys.
[6:06:26] BoezIRL: so can you choose to be in visage mode in combat or no?
[6:06:27] EKS90_: @stallowned actuually a really good UI for new players or players that don't like addons, but personally i think I will stick with dominos and SUI

[6:09:50] vasoka1: @Towelliee  what is the difference of dragon form between male / female?
[6:09:52] EKS90_: @RiptoreCA Bellular was saying that there is no borrowed systems or anything, its just the talent system.

[6:14:05] emznev: the zones seem like they have alot in them already @Towelliee
[6:14:07] Triist0ne: @Towelliee max saying tyrhold is the vibe for server
[6:14:08] szble: wonder if that works in bgs
[6:14:10] lel3owski: obtaining dragon riding is one of the first things you do in the expansion?
[6:14:10] precision79: why no fullscreen ?
[6:14:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: sounds like a fuck this shit im out racial
[6:14:13] PvtHudson093: I mean it wasnt hard to figure out by looking at the gifs on your twitter
[6:14:16] lalelusa: the knock backs don't interrupt, do they?
[6:14:17] Naturalbeef: Milton didn't get Alpha

[6:14:29] sapicypapayaa: demon hunter 2.0
[6:14:29] Cojoha: the important question is, does it feel like Warcraft?
[6:14:36] EpicBananners: ui impression?
[6:14:37] Maydie6066: omg towelliee its like your playing right now!!!
[6:14:38] karnebg: new action bars look pretty good
[6:14:39] Ahtilah: You mean, Dragons have mobility?

[6:14:44] Ahtilah: Kappa
[6:14:47] procyon_mfc: What mouse do you use? @towelliee
[6:14:47] saikouusagi: No gold spam bots in the alpha??
[6:14:51] Sadisticmedic: I saw MR GM tweets KEKW
[6:14:52] EKS90_: @sapicypapayaa because it has wings and can glide?
[6:14:55] skajaki: anyone know where the first raid located?
[6:15:01] metavahn231: so its true this will be done in 6 month?
[6:15:04] Janigiv: how long is the alpha @Towelliee ? when does it end?
[6:15:06] Theliahh: are servers up?
[6:15:08] tbmj_blaze: I have alpha access so when a dungeon wave happens I got you when you need people for a group
[6:15:10] king_julian_96: nixxiom
[6:15:15] king_julian_96: did you see him
[6:15:22] rbgdev: i saw him
[6:15:26] strchsr: @Towelliee 6 months is January
[6:15:30] EpicBananners: what are your impressions with the UI and do you think you will use less addons because of it?
[6:15:38] katalena007: Think this will be a fun class to play for newbies?
[6:15:38] raveside11: nice looking zone
[6:15:57] cornichonouille: the ui looks clean
[6:15:59] Amarlian: @Janigiv only blizzard knows that answer
[6:16:03] Kakotan2143: @EpicBananners he already said he likes it but will still use elvui
[6:16:08] EKS90_: @Towelliee I can see it being done in 4-5 since there is no extra minigames like torghast or borrowed powered systems they need to balance. but still a bit on the cautios side.
[6:16:15] realcousineddie: whats the benefit of group loot vs just trading personal loot?
[6:16:15] SpyCrabbo: @katalena007 you literally have to type in "advanced" during character creation to play it
[6:16:19] PvtHudson093: laser matrix
[6:16:21] snse: laser matrix
[6:16:24] Cetraben: you got haste from the azerite trait each week when you killed 3 bosses
[6:16:26] grizzlyhorn: the azerite that scaled with your boss kills laser matrix
[6:16:27] silodin: what was the uldir style?
[6:16:27] AlexikonTV: azerite power
[6:16:28] Neviriah: @katalena007 when you pick the class it says "are you sure you want to play this as it is an advanced class?" so I guess its not the best for newbies
[6:16:31] Skizzeh_: Not trying to be a debbie downer but this whole expansion came out of nowhere and is supposed to be done before the year is over?? Cmon man
[6:16:32] Wcvechten: Yeah, uldir azerite gear had laser matrix, got stronger when you killed bosses
[6:16:36] George2001k: @towelliee will Dragonflying replace our mounts?
[6:16:42] silodin: oooh the azerite thing
[6:16:45] name__error: wasn't that called Re-origination Array
[6:16:48] Theliahh: @Skizzeh_ it was clearly in development for a while
[6:16:57] Kakotan2143: I think they need to bring back keys for raids
[6:17:01] taintalizerx: then don't play @skizzeh_
[6:17:11] rbayduden: Doing the asmon thing i see
[6:17:12] pjahj: Azerite traits that increased every work if you killed 3 bosses every week
[6:17:13] Skizzeh_: Oh wow yall are salty LOL
[6:17:15] EKS90_: @Towelliee I can see it being done in 4-5 since there is no extra minigames like torghast or borrowed powered systems they need to balance. but still a bit on the cautios side. is what I  think.
[6:17:17] sellblade: Both. You had Re-origination Array, which was the Main Stat static buff and Laser Matrix, which was a buff
[6:17:17] skajaki: can u use your dragon mount outside the dragon ilses?
[6:17:20] rbayduden: climbing
[6:17:22] sellblade: They got stronger with boss kills
[6:17:23] king_julian_96: how long do we usually have alpha for before we get beta normally towelliee
[6:17:23] Khandak: Isn't it faster?
[6:17:34] EKS90_: @Skizzeh_ so are you since you are the one coming in and saying a bunch f negative stuff.
[6:17:35] Skizzeh_: I didnt even say anything bad i just said maybe take our time with it? not rush it out like they do every time?
[6:17:38] lunchbox8669: are we getting bigger bags lol?
[6:17:38] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[6:17:39] strchsr: @Towelliee Is it possible to just stay in Dracthyr form without ever swapping back to the human visage form?
[6:17:49] lithium364: damn salamander mounts? pog
[6:17:51] AlexikonTV: @Towelliee laser matrix was an azerite power
[6:17:54] PvtHudson093: Reorigination Array whenever you are within the zone (but not outside). This will grant a bonus amount of your current highest secondary stat (regardless of the item level of the Azerite piece) when within Uldir
[6:17:54] George2001k: @towelliee mythic only/last boss, Dragonflying skin?
[6:17:55] Skizzeh_: LOL i said a bunch of negative stuff? Homie read my messages
[6:18:08] name__error: man we have to ride those ugly dragons, when i have a celestial dragon
[6:18:09] strchsr: @Towelliee That's like if Worgen were forced into human form every time they mounted lol
[6:18:12] CyonDru: yeah its like druid, when in cat form you get form out to nelf again
[6:18:13] fumennen: @Towelliee  can you change the model of the dragon you ride?
[6:18:16] trustthejust1: why would they not make it like worgen
[6:18:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: does entering combat auto swap to dragon form?
[6:18:20] Fluisterwoud: so its like worgens, kinda?
[6:18:26] Zettabyte: 1 mount macro Kappa
[6:18:32] xhale2nhale: tbh if you have no interest in the xpac why come into a WoW stream to be negative n kill others vibe for the xpac?
[6:18:34] Kisswani: Ion did say that a dragon riding a dragon would be weird , but yeah you should auto return to dragon form on dismount
[6:18:36] CoolSax98: that's the way I like it. I had to create a macro to stay out of worgen form
[6:18:37] Hydro1904: Alpha out oh shit
[6:18:45] medanmarko: Do you shift out of worgen form when you mount up? If yes then this is expected from dragon form.
[6:18:46] stryngs_: CAN WE MAKE A PINK DRAGON?
[6:18:49] Nevindaz: Pog
[6:18:52] sellblade: @Towelliee Oh hang on yeah, wasn't the Mainstat thing and Laser procc both Azerite Powers, but if you had one active, you got the actual zone buff you were stacking with boss kills?
[6:18:53] xeeeoN: how big are the zones @Towelliee ?
[6:18:57] itsDets: Pog
[6:19:02] silodin: you cant stick with 1?
[6:19:04] lunchbox8669: can you keep the same one in all zones or do you have to switch in different zones?
[6:19:04] Luxicake: @xhale2nhale people are fkin weird man
[6:19:06] dustyzoose: wouldnt it be wierd for a dragon to ride another dragon though ?!
[6:19:07] sellblade: Aka the secondary stats people are talking about
[6:19:20] BrandonB21: i dont like all the fog @Towelliee
[6:19:20] Lythoraxx: concerning the dragons can use one for all the zones or do u get 4, one for eah zone
[6:19:23] PvtHudson093: right into a cliff
[6:19:23] Luxicake: Weeeeee
[6:19:27] Nokterian: sense of speed gonna be amazing
[6:19:27] skajaki: can u get yellow-> red glow aswell?
[6:19:29] xeeeoN: that looks so cool
[6:19:30] Mickol: Freee fallinn'
[6:19:30] abracka_: the fog that appears from being so high up, muh immersion boner
[6:19:32] hgizaira: the noise is annoying :D
[6:19:32] TombStoneMercenary: Is collision damage while flying?
[6:19:33] manmower: what speed are you going? hard to tell
[6:19:35] cdk058: HYPERS
[6:19:39] CyonDru: how did the flying feel? ppl thinks its gonna be jank compared to GW 2 @Towelliee
[6:19:39] Caedranos: @dustyzoose How do you think dragon whelps are made?
[6:19:40] puddypounce: FeelsGoodMan

[6:19:42] Zettabyte: SAVED
[6:19:51] Drogdorf: HYPERS weeeeee
[6:19:52] HaloS23: @Towelliee is there a way to stay in visage form all the time? like during combat too?
[6:19:54] sl1nky1981: Just wait until you go plaid
[6:19:59] sellblade: Bruh your dragon sounds like a plane engine KEKW
[6:20:02] Layliah79: Love the sound of it
[6:20:02] Q_TheDreamer: The wings don't seem to flap enough
[6:20:09] Rellak: dragon riding is pretty cool
[6:20:10] cheezier_: can you mount onto a flying mount or is it just these new drakes?
[6:20:12] stallowned: can you exit dragon form and reenter it in air or is there a cast time?
[6:20:20] Radiopools: Flying looks soo fast
[6:20:21] shale93: why does it sound like an airplane lol
[6:20:21] zwebbyb: LOL it does kinda sound like a plane going over your house
[6:20:22] Nevindaz: @sellblade F35 KEKW

[6:20:26] thelewdestpotato: @Towelliee speedometer addon probably going to be a thing lol
[6:20:26] EKS90_: @carnage424 you can mount it ,but not fly on it. dragonriding is the new flying for now.
[6:20:29] cornichonouille: @carnage424 you can mount, but cant fly with regular mount
[6:20:31] skajaki: is tier sets in the alpha yet?
[6:20:36] sellblade: @Nevindaz It does, doesn't it? KEKW
[6:20:42] Krelborn: So will there be a point to dragon flying, when/if they add regular flying to the dragon isles?
[6:20:42] Thoreya: the zone looks so good
[6:20:42] Lythoraxx: whats the 3 blue dots ?
[6:20:46] stryngs_: THIS ZONE LOOKS AMAZING
[6:20:53] Nevindaz: do you need to refuel the dragon sometime?
[6:20:53] laarrryy: is this the ingame music>
[6:20:55] FresheFefe: it looks pretty nice so far
[6:20:55] laarrryy: ?
[6:20:56] Rellak: holy crap that zone looks so good. hype off the charts
[6:20:57] Nevindaz: KEKW
[6:20:58] chhaase: are we gonna be flying with dragons as soon as we get to the area or do we have to unlock it as we level
[6:20:59] rblood80: How is the Dragonflight Alpha @towelliee
[6:21:04] captiv8: maybe engineers will be able to attach a rocket booster to their dragons tail?
[6:21:08] JocicHUN: Yes

[6:24:31] JasperLarvitar: first time in wow history zones have been designed with having that kind of mobility at the start.
[6:24:32] name__error: what does dragon riding do? is it just customizing your dragons look?

[6:31:17] manmower: give us Suramar as an M+
[6:31:17] dan_monk: But we have an exciting testing plan ahead with zones coming online, the rest of our dungeons, the rest of our systems, and more than ever before, we’ve baked a ton of time into our testing development plan to just respond to feedback and iterate and refine things like individual talent trees and all the rest to get them to a place where our players expect them to be when we launch the game later this year.
[6:31:17] rbolude: its nice, short, fun
[6:31:18] WhiteU: @Towelliee can the new race fly man?

[7:39:14] Wickerman87: Why cant we have Azure defender body types :(((
[7:39:14] Amarlian: I think focus testing makes a lot of sense for Alpha
[7:39:18] TerrClau: plus 100 more devs inc soon
[7:39:20] johncarsongames: If beta holds back story elements and some raid testing, then they could be ramping up pretty quick
[7:39:23] xhale2nhale: they probably did so much work and no idea if they had a whole new team to come in and help
[7:39:41] Naturecold: Is there a new Reputation Achievement past 100 reps in DF?
[7:39:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || EVERYTHING you NEED to know about the Dragon Riding System! - DRAGONFLIGHT ALPHA EXCLUSIVE youtu.be/TrGIQeHAG8o
[7:39:42] Casual_Oppa: Does the dragon form able to tmog into older outfits or is it just from this xpac?
[7:39:56] opaldiia: so you cant use regular flying mounts at all?
[7:39:58] SpenceSir: is there a way to customise your dragon ?
[7:40:01] Artenuous: seems more like a beta build, but are calling it alpha to make ppl happy lowkey
[7:40:02] ItsGlime: can you collect more than one dragon mount? or just the one you personalize
[7:40:06] itjustfeelsright: so is that the default drake mount or you get to choose?
[7:40:11] Wickerman87: cool!
[7:40:17] AlmightyGarldof: I swear dragonflying sounds like a fighter jet
[7:40:26] akia03: can you see item apearances yet from df?

[7:40:44] brucezhu: kalecgos got a new look
[7:40:48] Rodorann: i want to see it all
[7:40:56] ZyntosAran: not gonna lie. I am positively surprised, that it looks so polished, Dragonriding looks amazing, Evoker looks really fun, cant wait to dive into the talent trees and Profession specs. Only thing a bit disappointing is the missing UI Changes
[7:40:58] druidhex: I want to see healing !
[7:41:06] TimoShan: The dragonriding looks good. I was worried it was going to be very short bursts.
[7:41:09] shuey23: niiiice <3
[7:41:14] Alepouditsa: i am just glad you don't tread the lore so not that many spoilers
[7:41:20] procyon_mfc: sick
[7:41:30] druidhex: Healspec healspec healspec!
[7:41:33] BroffelofTV: map looks like something from mist of pandaria, ?
[7:41:34] manmower: give us mounted combat
[7:41:35] Alepouditsa: read*
[7:41:36] akia03: would it still be fun a week or 2 in or just get anoying just trying to get somewhere
[7:41:39] shuey23: I mean it looks rly dope, but I bet its even cooler when you do it PogChamp
[7:41:51] cosmin284: cool

[7:42:19] tawil_at_umr: are mods for dragons that give stats? (like speed etc) @Towelliee
[7:42:28] mysteriousm4n: not yet
[7:42:31] RiptoreCA: Leveling pace seems quick. Thankfully
[7:42:33] BigJustin26: is that arcing shot a skill shot or does it track the target?
[7:42:37] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  he's on org trying evoker
[7:42:40] tornbraclet: Chromie has to be in this expansion somewhere
[7:42:40] cosmin284: the visuals sure are stuning
[7:42:43] djdavecee: I'm late to the party, any sign of Chadgar yet?
[7:42:47] Gingerprimer: Suprised that MRGM did not get alpha tbh
[7:42:48] procyon_mfc: they start at 65 in Alpha
[7:43:06] BARGAW: do other classes work?
[7:43:07] Psynarius: so their QA has gotten better
[7:43:15] Gingerprimer: @BARGAW yes
[7:43:18] Alepouditsa: @djdavecee we saw him danHype
[7:43:20] ezxema: is this wow ?

[7:43:49] Janigiv: a little bit of azsuna feel too @Towelliee
[7:44:02] elgoblina: can you attack without going into dragon form?
[7:44:04] ZarisHeal: new casting bar looks cool also
[7:44:12] Fnchentai: this knockbacks
[7:44:15] Fnchentai: op asf
[7:44:18] Casual_Oppa: Be interesting to see how evoker will deal with PvP with all the hard casting
[7:44:18] djdavecee: @djdavecee PogChamp
[7:44:22] elgoblina: right on
[7:44:32] lyana54: Sloothyr is his name
[7:44:40] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[7:44:59] akia03: wait so you can just stay in human form to fight?
[7:45:01] SpenceSir: so you can look like a human to see you gear?
[7:45:04] Kon_Soul: So it's not like worgen where you auto-morph when you're in combat?
[7:45:07] SavageCheez: Seeing this for the first time, Is the Dragon Isles off the coast of Norhtrend? Looks like it could be.
[7:45:19] opaldiia: can you fight in human form?
[7:45:29] ZarisHeal: healer spec gameplay is just like a nontarget healer?
[7:45:39] druidhex: Preservation (healer) dracthyr is being played by Hazelnutty rn
[7:45:41] Honvar: Can you do combat in your human form @Towelliee ?
[7:45:45] Casual_Oppa: At least it looks fun & very different from everything else
[7:45:48] Atma23: These giant telegraphs look like wildstar
[7:45:49] jkitchin75: @scumxprophet he just said yes
[7:45:52] ItsGlime: whats the resource system
[7:46:16] nrgman: i hope it not getting annoying but just got here how is the alpha whats different
[7:46:16] lalelusa: I don't like the color wowhead chose for evoker. too close to monk color
[7:46:17] ZarisHeal: @druidhex well gotta check her then thanks. curious about healer one also.
[7:46:20] unresolved_broccoli: Im leveling my Rogue just like i've done every Xpac
[7:46:39] Alaquane: @roguedeeps but will you race change to tauren?
[7:46:46] ZyntosAran: @lalelusa its actually the color wow chose
[7:46:51] akia03: anybody spotted any new spirit beasts in this zone
[7:46:54] ItsGlime: is it like a builder/spender or a passive recovery?
[7:46:58] xFevers: is experience increased?
[7:47:13] unresolved_broccoli: @roguedeeps I've thought about it but im just so used to being a Panda now idk if I can switch
[7:47:13] vamp_0117: @lalelusa wowhead didnt choose that, blizz did
[7:47:13] Jeeve_Stobs: Does essense take up bag space?
[7:47:20] Balkep: was that enemy cast bar an addon?
[7:47:21] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[7:47:24] lalelusa: @lalelusa it is? an unfortunate choice
[7:47:25] ophidian500: lol
[7:47:26] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Landed too hard, RIP
[7:47:27] mysteriousm4n: bagspace KEKW

[7:47:40] Jeeve_Stobs: Not like anima, nice
[7:47:40] BRUTALIT0PS: Well shards USED to take up bag space to be fair LUL
[7:47:41] Atma23: Did they not test this, its literally one of their main new game features...
[7:47:41] Klarynse: he said shart
[7:47:44] Tidesages: @Towelliee may i ask do you like the new user interface ?
[7:47:48] Klarynse: lulul
[7:47:50] vamp_0117: @lalelusa theres not many colors left that wouldnt be similar to another class, if you think about it
[7:48:08] gladdsdaddy: lol
[7:48:09] MonacoStenz: I like the new standard Ui
[7:48:09] wetfinger: is this extra bag space slot???
[7:48:25] nihilistic_bat: but we all use 3rd party too KEKW
[7:48:27] taintalizerx: Ui is a waste of dev time imo. just let the addons do the work
[7:48:28] Azserk: dam i might not need bartender now
[7:48:32] Balkep: oh, this is better already
[7:48:34] Amarlian: I think the UI changes are great for Alpha, Betas and PTRs @Towelliee
[7:48:34] larualis: Imagine not customizing every single element of your screen
[7:48:36] lalelusa: @vamp_0117 well, luckily, there are other options for the color blind, I guess
[7:48:37] SlowpokeIsAGamer: @wetfinger It's only for profession bas
[7:48:42] Zapp_Brannigan86: need to make it like swtor uUI and customization
[7:48:43] Alepouditsa: i love thos pink tree's danWow
[7:48:43] Kneckt: @taintalizerx lol no
[7:48:43] ZyntosAran: @taintalizerx ui is not a waste for new players.
[7:48:48] SNaKEBOI: is there an import / export button fopr the ui?
[7:48:53] Kriven: the less stuff on my screen the betteer
[7:49:00] MrTerkyMan: essentially baked bartender into the game. which is all i've needed. I could never get used to elv/tuk so i'm fairly excited for it
[7:49:01] lalelusa: @vamp_0117 yeah, it's just unfortunate, if you're colorblind
[7:49:03] Aenvys: im not a fan of resource playstyles pimpcessHuhhh
[7:49:07] wetfinger: @SlowpokeIsAGamer thx!
[7:49:07] robotBison: can you change the player frame on the left there? thought I saw a wider hp bar
[7:49:08] robotBison: somewhere
[7:49:17] BigJustin26: did they say, "kil'jaeden must be destroyed...?"
[7:49:20] robotBison: player & target ui
[7:49:25] Kriven: @robotBison its not all done yet
[7:49:30] MonacoStenz: I also got overwatch 2 alpha on day 1. last time I played overwatch was during overwatch 1 alpha
[7:49:37] sshadeh: LUL
[7:49:39] duffluv22: Did he say Kiljaden must be destroyed????
[7:49:45] wakeandbacon95: oh shoot dude kale goc
[7:49:46] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I will say I'm real glad that there's a dedicated profession bag slot though. I was very worried when they previewed professions and herbalism looked like it'd need 30 slots just for Dragonflight herbs.
[7:49:59] jkitchin75: @duffluv22 think so
[7:50:10] BigJustin26: hey look it's the new weird mount thing
[7:50:29] willy_billy_silly: its the new mount
[7:50:29] mysteriousm4n: ^ LUL
[7:50:32] dwhalen2902: Hotbar setup reminds of FF
[7:50:44] Balkep: if they allow to move everything and adjust sizes of various elements, it would be a big deal for many people
[7:50:50] willy_billy_silly: those things you are fighting
[7:50:51] Snabido: @duffluv22 He's been saying that since TBC
[7:51:11] dwhalen2902: @Balkep That's something that should've been in the game already imo, not just as an addon
[7:51:37] nickwill27: can you get your dragon out while falling ?
[7:51:38] duffluv22: @snabido You think it would be updated by now??
[7:51:43] raldrik: I wonder how many M+ wipes that flame pass thing will cause
[7:51:47] Balkep: @dwhalen2902 agreed, the UI overhaul is long overdue
[7:51:53] PTGfry: coldarra
[7:51:58] MrTerkyMan: borean tundra nexus area
[7:52:02] BigJustin26: ya this looks a lot like Coldarra

[7:52:17] Kriven: I like it a lot
[7:52:18] mpmhall: awesome!!
[7:52:22] willy_billy_silly: you think there will be rares to farm in each zone for collectiable stuff
[7:52:24] Snabido: @duffluv22 Maybe it's a version of the NPC that's not been updated question mark question mark
[7:52:56] Janigiv: ranged rogue's @Towelliee KEKW
[7:53:00] dragothicx: 4x Evoker M+ KEKW

[7:53:29] BigJustin26: wee
[7:53:30] Kvoller: Is the itemlevel low in the starting zone?
[7:53:33] shaystafford: Do you need to be in dragon form to attack or can you attack in human form?
[7:53:42] EpicBananners: hi crix how are ya now?
[7:53:54] Balkep: oh no, not the red cross WutFace
[7:53:55] EpicBananners: multi stream kekw, gotta rep both

[7:59:51] Janigiv: so wheres hemet's son @Towelliee ?

[8:00:20] Nicstar1007: Reputation yeah
[8:00:31] Balkep: @Towelliee does it mean you need to regrind dragon flying abilities for each zone?
[8:01:00] Havoc_S1: @towelliee do you how long the 130 dollar pre order of DF will last for.

[8:01:24] w1ldfrog: is the personal resource upgrade?
[8:01:30] AdriiTheGamer: Will we be able to starta drakthyr before expansion release or do we have to level one as it is released?
[8:01:31] Vannkier: @roguedeeps I mean u dont really need to do it, and they said normal flying mounts will be available just not at launch
[8:01:51] unresolved_broccoli: @roguedeeps sweet thats good

[8:03:34] BigJustin26: so badgar
[8:03:48] Balkep: let's kill Khadgar and be friends with the dragon :)
[8:03:48] SNaKEBOI: i mean khadgar is pretty lame, he helps for 5 mins then fks off for 2 expansions at a time
[8:03:52] dysar5150: so he's like most players, he hates khadgar
[8:03:53] Artemisthemp: so he another person Khadgar stole from.
[8:04:02] xhale2nhale: He probably had a avatar questing in Legion n met Khadgar n got tired of him back then
[8:04:08] Vannkier: @roguedeeps They said it will come later and that's fine, even if you dont like dragon riding, this is a trillion times better than walking for half a year
[8:04:14] ZyntosAran: the tower in the cinematic was tyrhold
[8:04:30] Rottencoarse: oh there is a transmog icon on the minimap when ppl use the yak NICE @Towelliee !!
[8:04:36] Kakotan2143: I wonder if there are any OLD gods locked up anywhere there as well @Towelliee
[8:04:45] cosmin284: The visuals are so nice
[8:04:46] HaloS23: ah copy TY
[8:04:47] cosmin284: damnn

[8:04:54] baaronthemonk: @Towelliee There are datamined brewmaster spells on wowhead
[8:04:55] Roccobro: flappy bird style
[8:05:07] Fnchentai: let's hope we see kadgar death at a mob hands just like tirion
[8:05:07] Hellboylool: are paladin talents out?
[8:05:13] Recording_on_the_grass: very festive will be perfect for december
[8:05:21] TheCliffyShow: Holy crap! The Dracthyr customization is nuts.
[8:05:22] Balkep: can't wait to someone to do a comparison of dragon riding and normal flying in terms of speed once both are available
[8:05:29] Brannax: New UI still not complete? Was looking forward to the new health bars tbh..
[8:05:34] nelorixx: @Towelliee How big are the zones Mr Towelliee?
[8:05:45] Chuckforfun: I most say the Skills looks like Wildstar Aiming Stuff.. Like from the Healer or mage
[8:06:04] EKS90_: @Balkep My personal opinion is that I think that dragonriding will be faster if done correctly etc, but normal flying will be more "convinient" if u just wanna afk fly while grabbing a drink
[8:06:05] nelorixx: Thank the lord! HYPERS
[8:06:19] baldestt: How do armor sets work on Dracthyr? Is it only available through character customization or do equipped pieces show up? @towelliee
[8:06:21] BigJustin26: watch the duel!
[8:06:25] taintalizerx: he meant big as in tall mountains and shit lol
[8:06:32] Atma23: Original Azshara was huge
[8:06:38] Balkep: @Commander_Eggi yeah, I imagine it'll be like that in the end
[8:06:39] kiitzoeu: Can you show the Mastery ? :D
[8:06:50] Berexios123: are the mountains taller then highmountain?
[8:06:56] HaloS23: @Towelliee in the zones, do you see NPC dragons flying around like the bird in old world? or is it vacant still?
[8:07:02] kiitzoeu: Dafuq,
[8:07:12] migas03: i want to play the game now, does anyone have a cryogenic freezing machine so i can preserve myself till the release ?
[8:07:20] procyon_mfc: wow
[8:07:22] xsp00n: so stack 20 evokers to learn fights
[8:07:30] TacDuc: OMG, It's Mr. Towel, been a long time since I last saw you stream, as I have been so busy with work
[8:07:34] DPShaw: wat so boss dmg is insane
[8:07:37] BigJustin26: so you taper off as the bosses get low but it should even out
[8:07:47] Gungre: What classes can the dracthyr be?
[8:07:53] unholyez: Anyone else notice on the map that to the left of Ohn'ahran Plains there are some mountains encircling a bay. Almost looks like there was another zone attached to the Dragon Isles that sunk under the waves for some reason
[8:07:54] Janigiv: can u explain how the evoker resource work @Towelliee ?
[8:07:54] Berexios123: based on health % not health number
[8:07:54] thymos_: orcs cant be evokers FeelsBadMan
[8:07:59] valawartv: hi Towelliee, does the map feel large=
[8:08:00] TacDuc: @Gungre Evoker
[8:08:04] baldestt: How do armor sets work on Dracthyr? Is it only available through character customization or do equipped pieces show up?
[8:08:13] cheesebagss: this looks so bad
[8:08:13] Rayao: seems like mastery is not gonna be stacked on evoker :) why take a stat that only helps for part of the fight :)
[8:08:32] Balkep: @Thymos_ I just want an orc warrior healer spec Sadeg
[8:08:34] Molvonos: Dragonfrogs
[8:08:40] thymos_: GIANT FROGS POGGERS
[8:08:41] Thoreya: i feel like they have to make like one melee spec for dracythyr lol
[8:08:43] Thoreya: at some point
[8:08:48] Steadmoh190: how does the new class play?
[8:08:51] Kriven: would those be horny toads?
[8:08:53] Thoreya: or evokers
[8:08:58] migas03: GROMP Pog
[8:08:58] BigJustin26: bug
[8:09:06] トラ내三笑: Frogon
[8:09:13] lalelusa: that has to become a mount!
[8:09:16] Janigiv: can u explain how the evoker resource work @Towelliee ?
[8:09:22] crich85: They definitely missed the ball on not making black dragon tank or melee spec
[8:09:37] BigJustin26: oh i just thought that was just his, "i'm gonna get ya"
[8:09:59] TheCliffyShow: Is dragonflight just going to have a bunch of animals with dragon stuff added? Because I wanna see a dragon cat and dragon squirrel.
[8:10:00] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[8:10:06] pronkk_: @crich85 or they have added only melee spec into the game, and they intentionally didnt add a melee this time
[8:10:17] Steadmoh190: you should be able to unlock flying at max level as the dragon race seeing as you have wings, it can be like a racial
[8:10:21] Kastarian001: So theyre runes @Towelliee ?
[8:10:28] Honvar: Damn, a lot of dragons walking around Kappa
[8:10:41] janeratorr: Is this the zone music or are you listening to some other music?
[8:10:47] TacDuc: Frog and duck mounts, that is all I ask
[8:10:48] Uponn: is this a new Minimap or its an addon?
[8:10:49] 31Fox: Hey @Towelliee  woot love to see you in the early access.   Have you gone over how the basics of skill trees work.  Like when do you get your first points to spend?
[8:10:51] ShinyLox: lol I feel like everyone is going to be doing dragons
[8:10:53] Janigiv: very mage like
[8:10:55] 31Fox: x31foxCoffee
[8:11:12] MeisterPetze: are there transmogsets ingame?
[8:11:31] ZacharielPlays: can you dragon fly with your evoker?
[8:11:34] Steadmoh190: shame you cant fly with your own wings
[8:11:40] Steadmoh190: guess they're just for show
[8:11:46] ZacharielPlays: cuz you can see the wind things
[8:11:47] visaeris412: giving some wildstar vibes with the telegraphs
[8:11:50] ZacharielPlays: around you
[8:11:56] BigJustin26: everyone wants to try the new toy
[8:12:01] lalelusa: the dash mechanics will be interesting in close space dungeons
[8:12:04] Custodiss: so question @Towelliee and chat: does any1 know if you can use Dragonriding as the Drakthyr? like you are the mount?
[8:12:08] spizzoo: spizzoo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[8:12:08] ShadyWizWolf: Is there a stat squish this expac? @Towelliee
[8:12:09] akia03: so is erp going to be the new arena meta?

[8:12:14] The_Natural: @visaeris412 yeah it's awesome, i hope they do more of it in the future. it was great in WS
[8:12:27] Chuckforfun: Must say the Spells looks like Wildstar ;D
[8:12:30] 31Fox: x31foxSalute
[8:12:49] ShadyWizWolf: Kind of don't look like a stat squish lol
[8:12:58] Steadmoh190: so you stay in dragon form during combat? kinda like the worgen?
[8:13:05] PrenuptialPinball: Expansion= endless issue of bag space. lol

[8:13:27] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Gratz
[8:13:28] 31Fox: Wait is there a level or stat squish?   hope not.
[8:13:34] PadidinJones: Ding fries 🍟 are done ✅
[8:13:36] The_Natural: i think comparing the telegraphs to WS is a good thing, it was really well-done in WS and could be awesome in WoW. imagine a mage charging a pyroblast
[8:13:54] tornbraclet: wait towelliee world first lvl 66? lol LUL LUL LUL LUL

[8:15:00] Rottencoarse: or the frost shield
[8:15:03] procyon_mfc: like a shield break
[8:15:05] Molvonos: Depends on how heavy enemy absorb shields become
[8:15:06] Rottencoarse: ice barrier
[8:15:17] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  i hope at the end of the expac we will have all the tlaent nodes maxed out and keep leveling up for a paragon points
[8:15:23] ZacharielPlays: yep
[8:15:25] ZacharielPlays: bubble burst
[8:15:27] ZacharielPlays: baby
[8:15:32] Strifelol: Yes, you are breaking their shield.

[8:30:49] Kneckt: Where do u think this expac will rank in ur expac rankings? Kappa
[8:30:50] ThatW0lF: so a dragon class isnt melee?
[8:30:58] Dkgungo: oh damn nice

[8:32:18] corpowarr: I'm seeing GDKP runs on the horizon
[8:32:20] natevic: they would still need funnels or traders for more of there players to get a chance at loot.
[8:32:22] diivil92: they still will but less overall runs
[8:32:29] lightslegend: okay cool ty
[8:32:29] shmasherd: does evoker have a light healing spell similar to how an ele shaman does?
[8:32:32] Scoodles91: they have enough alts anyway, probebly wont need extra ppl
[8:32:34] b3ez0r: is this the dps class
[8:32:36] crich85: Bring one of each armor class for the funnel
[8:32:38] Mattsta: probably still split runs...just not like all one class, but 5 mains to get loot and the rest there to fill out a run
[8:32:41] Hjolt: its nice to see that those mobs can make a dent in you
[8:32:42] ThatW0lF: whats the name of the two sepcs?
[8:32:45] DJKidoteoriginal: Wait. All this time they had solo loot? So I could do a raid and get my own loot and not have to fight other players for it???? @Towelliee

[8:32:45] natevic: good point scoodles

[8:33:14] ZyntosAran: you have to target yourself for the heal
[8:33:16] ThatW0lF: Okay ty

[8:33:23] Berexios123: damage if you are targeting enemy
[8:33:24] Rayao: cast on enemy = dmg, cast on ally = heal
[8:33:27] guga_official: sooooo sad

[8:33:38] ThatW0lF: Dwragon OwO
[8:33:38] tawney_owl_: its kinda wild because gw2 just came out with a rogue spec thats a heal/damage healer just like evoker in EoD
[8:33:49] DJ_PWNZ: is this the standard new UI?
[8:34:05] RedBullFlyTV: it's the primary single target heal for preservation as well

[8:36:02] ShinyLox: Are you switching mains @Towelliee
[8:36:03] DJKidoteoriginal: Wait. All this time they had solo loot? So I could do a raid and get my own loot and not have to fight other players for it???? @Towelliee

[8:38:04] JasperLarvitar: yeah, life magic.
[8:38:08] the_general01: its like shooting people with an assault cannon in swtor to heal them lol
[8:38:10] Brannax: Yeh it’s kind of how Alezstrasza worked in HOTS
[8:38:14] Redacted_: youre shooting them with pure health potion
[8:38:15] procyon_mfc: Alex - red healing
[8:38:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: well bounty hunters would shoot people to heal them in swtor lol
[8:38:31] jmalmin: You call down the light as a Paladin heal someone. or the sun as a sun walker... so its okey to cast healing flames.
[8:38:32] Tbuck92: damn dragon riding just looks so good

[8:38:37] tawney_owl_: i wanna see how dragonriding compares to skyscale riding in GW2

[10:13:44] Buckwink: so we can trade any loot we get now?
[10:13:45] toobaked1987: Wait..... He didnt say group loot was confirmed right. I thought they were considering it?
[10:14:11] drachenauge: ion is designing wow to a dungeon game its world of warcraft not world of dungeoncraft
[10:14:16] NewWorldReign: Oh god we go through Uldaman again?
[10:14:24] Broomba: 10-4

[10:17:05] Honvar: @Short_Film Wait until Towelliee reacts on that! :)
[10:17:08] NewWorldReign: Wait, doesnt one of the Aspects turn Infinite Dragonflight leader, maybe thats how Galakrond, Deathwing etc get brought back
[10:17:24] Sadisticmedic: The Turtle returned to the water
[10:17:25] IrrelevantFerret: Looks like they don't intend to improve the aiming on those
[10:17:27] drachenauge: i realy hope ion gets fired after Microsoft taken Activision Blizzard
[10:17:35] toobaked1987: Dont watch that shit on his channel. Asmon put the interview out before Towelliee did? What?

[10:20:00] EKS90_: this zone looks amazing compared to anythign in SL, more my aesthetic.
[10:20:01] drunch85: Towelliee is the fated raids mount on the mount list in alpha?   Mr. Jigglesworth Sr.
[10:20:06] sargeantmajorfish: ok but I'm right so laugh if you want, you won't bet me

[10:22:43] MysticRaven_: @NewWorldReign yh
[10:23:26] drachenauge: who wants pvp servers be back too?
[10:23:38] RagingPunk: have they talked about endgame content at all?
[10:23:44] HeatherJC83: @drachenauge no
[10:23:48] EKS90_: @drachenauge naa, warmode is good enough

[10:24:22] RagingPunk: @Zeegh sweet thanks :)
[10:24:28] abracka_: did khadgar say something like, "kil'jaeden must be stopped" when you clicked on him?
[10:25:04] Syllvn: @abracka_ new VO will be much later
[10:25:05] Colt_Engineer: CHAMPION!!!
[10:25:11] HeatherJC83: i think none of us share your opinions @drachenauge
[10:25:14] procyon_mfc: you have the power of all 5 dragonflights is the lore kinda
[10:25:15] Kale_Nd: @abracka_ that was kalec no khadgar

[10:26:21] Icemanbaird: Does no health squish again feel bad?
[10:26:24] sipsac: Hey Towelliee, just joined the stream. How does it work for healing ? is it 2 different specs ?
[10:26:53] LeagueofAdi: show us the fire dash
[10:27:03] net_mi: can you show the talent tree?
[10:27:06] NewWorldReign: what colour drac is tank/dps/healing?
[10:27:06] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[10:27:10] NEMERL: Fire aoe and Frost more single i guess from wowhead @towelliee
[10:27:30] sipsac: Hows the feel of the expansion so far ? loving the vibe ?
[10:27:49] Balkep: @Towelliee are the enemy castbars standard UI?
[10:27:54] Manyzenny: is there any way to get back into wow without doing renown and all the systems? I just want to pvp
[10:27:54] zavonofcats: @Towelliee what's the general rotation like?
[10:27:59] trippppppz: highlight over each talent point for 3 seconds plz
[10:27:59] Exxcar: @NewWorldReign drac is dark green, and they don't have tank
[10:27:59] raye_gaming22: quite solid for the first apha build no crashes and dcs
[10:28:07] HeatherJC83: @net_mi you can see the talent tree on wowhead https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc
[10:28:09] the_general01: @NewWorldReign they dont have a tank
[10:28:10] Miguel85NYC: looks a lot like FF 14
[10:28:22] Kneckt: ??

[10:28:32] Manyzenny: is there any way to get back into wow without doing renown and all the systems? I just want to pvp
[10:28:37] Jiraiya110: does the new UI have dps meter ?
[10:28:43] Aidler: you can find the entire talent tree on wowhead and look at it as long as you like
[10:28:44] abracka_: pepegas are out in force
[10:29:05] EKS90_: @Manyzenny yes, in dragonflight. cause legendaries and all that with renowns covenents and soulbinds are active in pvp
[10:29:11] Short_Film: @towelliee is your interview with Ion on your youtube?
[10:29:11] Varsader: hows the class feel to you? @Towelliee
[10:29:14] rosina_scarlett: so are all of evokers casts instant?
[10:29:18] Heaay: Is this the game music or your own music?
[10:29:22] Bogzeh: is that their only movement skill?
[10:29:30] sipsac: Oh shit, we can fly out of the gate ?
[10:29:30] Broomba: @towelliee -- the alpha version of DF you played on for 2 days -- was it a different DF client or on your bnet?
[10:29:34] ewoksonsteroids: Is the video and audio from stream desync for anyone else?
[10:29:37] Manyzenny: bummer, df can't get here soon enough
[10:29:45] rosina_scarlett: @ewoksonsteroids refresh
[10:29:54] Balkep: @ewoksonsteroids seems fine for me
[10:30:08] Ludicruz: @jiraiya110  Think of it this way,  why should blizzard implemend an ingame DPS meters when there are few ones available for us as addons ?
[10:30:19] Aidler: no desync here
[10:30:23] EKS90_: @Manyzenny yeah you unlolck soulbinds and conduit slots etc with renown and campaign and legendaries are crafting and works in pvp, so if u wanna play wow and not do systems ,just wait, or level i tbc classic and play wotlk when it comes.
[10:30:31] the_general01: @Ludicruz the same reason they implemented ingame bagnon
[10:30:47] Jiraiya110: ok thanks
[10:30:49] NewWorldReign: kill the ookers LUL
[10:30:54] MysticRaven_: love the gnolls new model they've updated the existing ones two so hogger and other gnolls look mean
[10:31:05] mandarinetip: lol
[10:31:12] CrunkyBrewster: thats cool
[10:31:13] CrunkyBrewster: yeah
[10:31:14] reaprwolf: @Ludicruz same reason they implemented other things that were add ons.
[10:31:20] magakigr: nice flying when dead from the start
[10:31:33] rosina_scarlett: @Towelliee how long do you think 60-70 will take?
[10:31:41] Balkep: no dragon riding for when dead? what is this? Kappa
[10:31:48] TheCliffyShow: @MysticRaven_ They definitely needed it.
[10:31:56] Ridiculousness_gaming: @masumi_scarlett 1 day :D
[10:32:02] MrGattz: so... youre account sharing sacHMM
[10:32:04] ajkftw: @towelliee could you show healer spec please?
[10:32:19] Broomba: @ajkftw authorized by blizz
[10:32:25] Exxcar: @ajkftw Its on the Wowhead calculator. He doesn't heal
[10:32:27] NVbrutal: @Towelliee how is this alpha compared to previous xpac alphas as far as bugs/glitches go?
[10:32:33] Ludicruz: @the_general01  @reaprwolf   In all honestly,  I don´t think blizzard cares that much for ingame DPS meters as a part of theyr UI,  they might implemend it at some point,  but they have never done so.
[10:32:48] Broomba: @ajkftw sorry i tagged you in the wrong answer
[10:33:08] Broomba: @MrGattz he was account sharing -- hes a rebel
[10:33:10] the_general01: @Ludicruz maybe youre right, but im giving you the logical reason. there was no reason for the combine bags button but here we are lol
[10:33:27] Ludicruz: ture
[10:33:30] Ludicruz: *true
[10:34:03] EKS90_: and those DCs could be a part of the standard dismount/landing DC bug that has been in the game for years, hope they can fix it sometime
[10:34:05] the_general01: im good with the addons tho. and ive never used bagnon, so ill be interested to see how good it is
[10:34:08] HeatherJC83: @ajkftw https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc look here
[10:34:11] procyon_mfc: did relogging help to save the UI?
[10:34:18] Ludicruz: @the_general01  It´s Adibags for me,  bagnon is ok. I´ve liked adi more
[10:34:38] Broomba: instead of checking out the game play, overall system, etc of a new alpha people are malding over blizz implements new features that are found in addons -- KEKW
[10:34:39] rosina_scarlett: so this it the new UI?
[10:34:40] drachenauge: evoker should get a third spec also dh should get a third spec
[10:34:46] the_general01: im a noob, i just use the regular bags lol
[10:35:04] LadyJasmin: ask sloothyr he might
[10:35:10] Sadisticmedic: @HeatherJC83 TY that is really cool
[10:35:14] HeatherJC83: @the_general01 towD
[10:35:18] EKS90_: @the_general01 Wouldn't call you a noob, there is nothing wrong with those bags cause u can filter them search in them etc anyway, used em for the longest time aswell.
[10:35:21] HeatherJC83: @Sadisticmedic you're welcome
[10:35:26] Dudutoolbox: how freaking fast is that?
[10:35:33] Exxcar: Dragon Riding is already my favorite new feature..
[10:35:40] the_general01: @Dudutoolbox in a word, very
[10:35:44] egraves7: good fuck that looks fun
[10:35:49] tumb_tack: I am sold..
[10:35:55] Rygel_XVII: How does it stack up against griffons in GW2
[10:36:01] Brannax: Animations are pretty nice, kinda wish the landing had a bit more
[10:36:03] Aidler: so they were working on this while they weren’t working on shadowlands. did they give up on shadowlands this early?
[10:36:06] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so you were controlling that ride or is it like a path already set
[10:36:06] EKS90_: but you know, players want the "normal flying" cause this is to "annoying to not afk fly with "
[10:36:17] arieuh: can you change ui???
[10:36:21] HeatherJC83: @FranciscoTheMage you control it
[10:36:24] sipsac: Whats the point of flypoints ? dont u fly faster on your dragon ?
[10:36:25] SpenceSir: Towelliee are there any rewards yet for rep in the alpha?
[10:36:31] PimpinMuffins: @towelliee so is the dragon riding like replacing flight paths?
[10:36:35] jermaine228tv: when does this xpac drop?
[10:36:35] Clodagh_Lunaria: AWWWW
[10:36:39] Clodagh_Lunaria: Look at the baby!!!!!
[10:36:41] Dudutoolbox: hopefully it's not something they forget like scenarios
[10:36:41] RageerPLZ: it's not meant to be used as afk flying, if they want they can still afk farm with regular flying
[10:36:42] solsaver12: ROFL
[10:36:44] EKS90_: @FranciscoTheMage 100% player controlled. look at the gw2 griffin flying videos on youtube, its basically that.
[10:36:45] SirSquaggles: IT'S SO SMOL
[10:36:45] Riuujin_: Do the new "hold to cast" spells also work with macro's?
[10:36:46] Urebaldd: Looks like a tasty meal
[10:36:46] HeatherJC83: @sipsac afk flight liol
[10:36:49] Neziko: It looks like you were throwing up on it
[10:36:50] mcgillacutty916: hows evoker?
[10:36:51] Nehcrom: Looking rather polished for an alpha doesn't seem that unreasonable for a december release.
[10:36:52] Meowzamere: omg
[10:37:02] drachenauge: please tuskar as playbale race for the horde
[10:37:06] LUKA_THIM: people finally got the tuskar expansion they wante
[10:37:11] HeatherJC83: towCry  its too cute towCry towCry
[10:37:17] procyon_mfc: TUSK!
[10:37:19] arieuh: ca  you show me if can cha ge ui????
[10:37:21] cosmin284: Tuskar race pog
[10:37:35] Janigiv: plenty
[10:37:43] FranciscoTheMage: LORD HELP us. more reps to grind
[10:37:47] KingSpud91: Makes sence for it to be in all zones
[10:37:49] FranciscoTheMage: why cant they get away from that
[10:37:50] Neziko: Neziko subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! towHAMUP
[10:37:52] KingSpud91: sense*
[10:37:54] Kneckt: Valdrakkan is the main hub i believe
[10:37:55] Aidler: wrath of the tuskar
[10:37:57] Nehcrom: @Towelliee Since you have played previous alphas how polished does this seem, would a december release be probably from your experience?
[10:37:57] Riuujin_: isnt is just grouped by expansion?
[10:38:08] flazy_2595: Can you only play as evoker?
[10:38:09] tornbraclet: didnt the horde have a tuskar faction in Wotlk
[10:38:27] Broomba: no
[10:38:36] solsaver12: lol
[10:38:40] MistyValkyrie: the main city is Valdrakkan
[10:38:41] Janigiv: @tornbraclet that was taunka the tauren looking dudes
[10:38:43] truvidienn: Do we need to relevel our profressions again?
[10:39:20] Exxcar: @truvidienn Will probably like Legion and later, where you'll have DF specific leveling you'll have to do
[10:39:22] NewWorldReign: So is this area like the endgame area for max level characters? @Towelliee
[10:39:24] BrowneePoints: I think the finnicky levers and buttons for this expac are much easier for the Devs to grok than a ton of deep systems this go around. @Towelliee
[10:39:24] cosmin284: I think will be some new recipes
[10:39:33] Nehcrom: Nice analysis thanks.
[10:39:35] Exxcar: @NewWorldReign Nope, just a leveling zone
[10:39:41] headninja1ncharge: The UI looks bonkers
[10:39:43] Aidler: @truvidienn don’t think the old profession tiers will change
[10:39:46] BrowneePoints: Shores into Plains into Span

[10:39:50] tornbraclet: @Janigiv i thought they had the tuskar town in dragon blight too
[10:39:56] Onearmyof2: Ion said that they want to get a new zone out every week in Mr Gms interview
[10:39:57] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i am surprised you didnt ask Ion where is my alpha invite Kappa
[10:39:59] procyon_mfc: 60 talents per spec, 3 specs, 9 classes?
[10:40:08] magakigr: waking shores should the draktyr starting zone

[10:41:40] Thunderbrew: It looks like Northrend.
[10:41:43] Brannax: Bah, Pandaren are the ACTUAL shufflers
[10:41:45] BigJustin26: every day he's shufflin
[10:41:51] binkz77: what level do envokers start at
[10:41:54] tornbraclet: @Janigiv that's right they did have that one there. i thought the tuskars was a faction back then too
[10:42:01] Brannax: @binkz77 58
[10:42:09] binkz77: ty
[10:42:24] Brannax: I think, 2 levels in their personal starting zone to 60 if I recall
[10:42:31] BrowneePoints: It's not a shuffle, this is a specific dance I can't think of at the moment

[10:44:07] rhsiuol: they need to make them beefier
[10:44:11] Brannax: @Brannax Maybe? That would make sense.
[10:44:13] BrowneePoints: it looks a LOT like the Cutting Shapes dance by Don Diablo
[10:44:33] NewWorldReign: You'd of thought that made the tank drac look beefier.
[10:44:40] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[10:51:51] b_a_y_a: in normal form dance same?
[10:51:56] TheCliffyShow: The dancing was to strong.

[10:54:34] TheCliffyShow: Oh, WoWhead has the Alexstraza elf model. It's really nice. Still wish it was more revealing, though.
[10:54:34] procyon_mfc: can more than 3 currencies be added?
[10:54:46] Bayne77: i would use that bag ui
[10:54:50] CaptainJoeyNY: Honestly, Id rather use the defualt UI and customize it to look like mine, cause all these addons bog down performance
[10:54:51] Zeppyy: That would be me, been using the default ui for years. I'm excited for these changes
[10:54:52] abracka_: @Kneckt mommystraza <3
[10:54:54] Janigiv: model updates for alexstrazsa on wowhead @Towelliee
[10:54:58] Karbonn: I use addons that pretty much make the UI look exactly like this new UI
[10:55:05] Defocus: no paladin talent trees yet?
[10:55:07] FranciscoTheMage: you really shouldn't have to download so many addons to make the UI feasible. im glad they revamp it
[10:55:09] Brannax: Hell yeah. That model is legions better than the HOTS one
[10:55:09] Karbonn: so.. honestly i could see myself just using this new UI
[10:55:20] procyon_mfc: like in default UI you could add your bag to show tokens of different factions under currency tab @Towelliee
[10:55:30] CaptainJoeyNY: I HATE the vanilla character bars, and I LOVE Luna/ SHadowed bars
[10:55:30] procyon_mfc: like Darkmoon faire tokens etc
[10:55:40] cappei: Next class they're adding is Shaman. Hope they don't fuck it up

[11:48:54] Onearmyof2: I feel like it wont be as bad as SL since we dont have to pick a covenant and everything each time
[11:48:54] dukler: @Towelliee
[11:48:56] strike879: that needs to be a mount
[11:49:03] TheOldSchoolRyan: @Towelliee Have you had a chance to look at the new mounts? Some look real nice!
[11:49:06] HeatherJC83: @dukler he knew
[11:49:09] Osculatus: anybody know when the 50% exp buff is coming? :(

[11:49:41] Naturalbeef: I think that was Dorki
[11:49:42] SethLan: he knew
[11:49:51] BadXo: I'm guessing Druid flight form will not have dragon riding attached to it?
[11:49:54] doomester: @Towelliee when do you think Beta will launch?
[11:49:56] grumpnamedjosh: the new placeholder gladiator mount looks good

[11:50:09] Patadot: Do you know if they plan to rework nemaplates as well? as long as the UI rework
[11:50:13] Kneckt: Ion said month and a half

[11:50:46] toobaked1987: Towelliee can you see it being a 2022 release?????

[11:50:48] HeatherJC83: towHype towHype towHype
[11:50:53] z0mbawa: lessgo
[11:50:56] wisplingz: i really wonder the dungeons
[11:51:00] ZarisHeal: I am really curious about dungeons, i want to see the dungeons we ll suffer for next 2 years LUL
[11:51:05] Onearmyof2: @Towelliee Ion said that every week they want to have a new zone up on the alpha(MrGm vidoe)
[11:51:14] Kneckt: "And so we’re going to have a lot of excitement over the next month and a half as we roll out our zones, the rest of the talent trees, dungeons, everything else. And then as soon as it’s all there, we’ll move onto Beta." - Ion Wowhead interview
[11:51:16] infinityarty: its a talent in the shared tree now
[11:51:26] SphinxyOCE: and dead LUL
[11:51:29] TheOldSchoolRyan: Rip
[11:51:31] Vercross92: if they do 3 months for season 4, 3-4 weeks for pre-patch, launch i'd bet could be Nov. 29th
[11:51:32] procyon_mfc: KEKW

[11:51:45] Arbszy: KEKW
[11:51:51] Crowargus: haha
[11:51:51] The_Dane_Train: Im happy with dragonflight so far - but I want more depth in the whole of the game. There is no way to have enough ‘end game’ content to replace an entire world of forgotten content. I there there are a bunch of underrepresented players that want engaging leveling.
[11:51:54] z0mbawa: rest in pieces towelliee
[11:52:00] z0mbawa: LUL
[11:52:03] Velzenx: chat how big are the zone s
[11:52:04] belaham: so you just need everyone to go over there and kill it to see if it drops anything lol
[11:52:20] TheOldSchoolRyan: How slow does your character marker move when moving with map open?
[11:52:37] strike879: flying while dead its already great
[11:52:39] trevt6: these zones look so gigantic
[11:52:45] Patadot: Is a sort of Korthia for 4 zones
[11:52:48] Kneckt: Did you see Ion basically said month and a half until beta? in the wowhead interview
[11:52:53] infinityarty: what are the rewards tho from the renown?
[11:52:58] Meakis: The fact that it's a single island again i think the rep/renown will feel a lot better and connected again. Each time having to FP or teleport to get somewhere it feels disconnected
[11:53:02] Kneckt: Korthia monkaS
[11:53:03] Robodope: okay lol don't say that
[11:53:10] skewlbeta: I thought he said having four Zerith Mortis?"
[11:53:10] Spec69: korthia?? you mean zereth mortis LUL
[11:53:15] Feerumi: I think they said zereth mortis :D
[11:53:20] wisplingz: I think the early time we will see the tier sets and legendaries will be beta right ?
[11:53:21] skewlbeta: Cuz if it's 4 korthia it's DOA lol
[11:53:31] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee are existing races getting more class options in DF?
[11:53:34] Robodope: hey kids I heard you liked korthia
[11:53:44] Meakis: So are there single kill WQ again ?
[11:53:57] Crowargus: i liked korthia at the start didnt like korthia prolonged it was all right
[11:54:07] ZonnyArk: whats a wildstar guardian
[11:54:22] Meakis: Skinny KT rogue would be great
[11:54:25] Aidler: in the mrgm interview ion said that azure span is probably the biggest zone they ever made

[12:22:57] thatoneguynobodylikes352: It's literally just all of northrend stuck together
[12:22:59] SethLan: durotar
[12:23:04] TheOldSchoolRyan: This looks worse than the walk for the vanilla Water Totem quest in the barrens.
[12:23:04] SethLan: barrens
[12:23:06] NinjaChane: which is great those are some of my all time favorite zones
[12:23:07] Xaviwan078: i like the zone in dragonflight its big and the tree are big
[12:23:07] lekkahdh: yeah looks like a big mix of all of northrend :O
[12:23:07] Archrade: I think vash'jir might be bigger

[12:23:36] procyon_mfc: Vash has depth tho
[12:23:45] lekkahdh: @procyon_mfc nice
[12:23:49] Thoreya: there needs to be stuff going on
[12:23:51] Elwhappo: any self respecting druid would be using travel form, just sayin
[12:23:51] Thoreya: in the zones
[12:23:52] CrunkyBrewster: agreed
[12:23:54] Thoreya: exactly
[12:23:56] procyon_mfc: danGachi
[12:23:57] the_general01: @Archrade i think vash'jir might feel bigger because movement is so much slower within it
[12:24:00] god_mus: How you liking it @towelliee ?
[12:24:04] Thoreya: like it would be such a waste of space
[12:24:06] cptrogers123: they NEED to have world content man
[12:24:08] thatoneguynobodylikes352: good mob density
[12:24:20] mavericks312: vash'jir is a trash zone lol

[12:24:29] Rabiahtaro132: I want to engrosed by side content and forget what I was doing in the main story.
[12:24:30] Esclav: Esclav subscribed with Prime. 
[12:24:33] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Following the road you shouldn't run into mobs tho, right?
[12:24:34] Thoreya: they said 4 ZMs but like
[12:24:36] Thoreya: this def aint it
[12:24:40] lekkahdh: fly
[12:24:42] Thoreya: unless it changes when we hit max lvl
[12:24:43] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Like that's exactly the point of roads
[12:24:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Needs moar ducks
[12:24:51] Archrade: @the_general01 Movement with seahorse was %450 so technically mounted speed is fastest in vash'jir
[12:24:52] cptrogers123: isnt that mount really slow on ground?
[12:24:53] HeatherJC83: @Rabiahtaro132 YES
[12:24:55] mrniceguy817: So how’s the dragon flight mechanic can you take off from a stand still or do you have to jump then sore ?
[12:25:03] Xaviwan078: korthia not my best zone in wow
[12:25:08] Aervyper: @Towelliee the dragon running sound effects are 10/10
[12:25:18] TweektheProphet: it seem like they made the space big for dragon flying in mind but didn't think for mounted people
[12:25:21] foofighters182: fly
[12:25:32] reduxo: god no, thats what i hated about shadowlands
[12:25:36] Xaviwan078: its like skyrim in wow lol
[12:25:40] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I thought the dragon isles weren't like, directly hostile. No big bad to stop us
[12:25:40] lekkahdh: roads always have been a sort of safe haven IMO
[12:25:47] kappaday23: LUL
[12:25:49] NinjaChane: Holy shit
[12:25:50] warditty: how is the protagonists
[12:25:52] NinjaChane: lol

[12:26:35] Epiclurker27893: Nagrand had patrols that ganked AFK players on certain roads.
[12:26:36] reduxo: dragonflight unhinged
[12:26:39] cptrogers123: You can make huge zones, but if there is no content involved, then it doesnt really matter how big the zones are @Towelliee
[12:26:40] HeatherJC83: @Aervyper omg stop!! towNot
[12:26:48] Naturalbeef: I flying that dragon even if I am just crossing the road
[12:26:50] grumpnamedjosh: its not a slow mount, it just looks slow compared to the size of the things he is passing
[12:26:52] TheOldSchoolRyan: I hope they add an achievement named Falling With Style
[12:26:57] NinjaChane: with zones this big think there would be huge amounts of world quests in each zone too

[14:17:15] itsindominus38: those talents look really complex
[14:17:16] Archrade: covenant spells might be a shadowlands only in DF?
[14:17:33] The_Dane_Train: Wonder how they are going to work that out for people that level chromie time.
[14:17:35] atrexy_: Ofc it is there you chose nightfea xd maybe they didnt get rid of covenant abb
[14:17:37] Attackroot: go to new zone and see what happens
[14:17:38] avat707: SPEC into incarn

[14:17:45] Croxssis: @Towelliee can you use it outside sl though?
[14:17:50] IceMECH: later in alpha, all features found fun to players will be adjusted to require a meaningful choice via reputation grind.
[14:17:58] NinjaChane: 2 stack Covenant abilites
[14:18:10] j_bar111: doesnt incarn replace berserk?

[14:19:31] Archrade: what about soulshape?
[14:19:37] net_mi: You are right, it doesn't make any sense, they will disable covenant abilities in the future
[14:19:38] reactive_author24: 2 years later* : oh I miss sylvanas
[14:19:41] kokochris: dang no alpha ... yet... :(  it looks nice tho, love the talent tree
[14:19:45] opaldiia: yea does soulshape work?

[14:19:54] gairefear: Convoke OP
[14:19:57] Defenzor: Defenzor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 127 months, currently on a 127 month streak! towHAMUP
[14:20:12] opaldiia: 127 months? holy
[14:20:15] lmtheboogie: Chat what’s your ridiculously early opinion on dragonflight?
[14:20:33] Archrade: Convoke is in talents too. what about soulshape? Can you use it?
[14:20:36] Attackroot: im sure they will do some kinda of fix to make it so covenant stuff dont work in DF.
[14:20:36] bruhSit_farmer: @lmtheboogie that its an expansion
[14:20:37] IceMECH: pve will be awesome, pvp will suck
[14:20:39] Brannax: Actually does anyone know if theres an upgrade for dragon flying to mount it while moving?
[14:20:42] KatieGaming: Makes me not wanna play any more Shadowlands lol
[14:20:42] Nazz_1138: TRY IT
[14:20:45] opaldiia: yeah it does i think
[14:20:45] Attackroot: i think it does
[14:20:49] Ajin_xd: yes
[14:20:52] opaldiia: @KatieGaming same
[14:20:52] atrexy_: Normally it does
[14:20:55] GalvinW: All the new stuff is cool, but it'll be the same ole raiding and m+'ing with your guild. if that's what you like to do
[14:20:58] net_mi: @lmtheboogie shaping to be a great exp
[14:21:03] reactive_author24: I hope continent is bigger than northrend
[14:21:03] gairefear: Dragonflight seems promising if they listen to feedback, less daily grind is good @lmtheboogie
[14:21:36] lmtheboogie: Nice! Good to see some positivity
[14:21:41] beux03: There will be meta builds  i main gaurdian druid and can already tell there will be meta talents
[14:21:46] gairefear: The grinds of BFA and shadowlands just ruined the game for me, legion was enough
[14:21:56] Archrade: Soushape is avaialble?
[14:21:57] j_bar111: could be 61
[14:21:59] SphinxyOCE: could be yeah
[14:22:06] tronbadgames: @Towelliee shadowlands is going into chromie time, right?
[14:22:20] opaldiia: so soulshape works?
[14:22:21] SphinxyOCE: @shutupRoman yep
[14:22:26] GalvinW: I'll play probably for a month, mostly to keep my addon updated. but my eyes on are D4
[14:22:40] opaldiia: did you try getting a covenent with dracthyr/evoker?
[14:22:45] opaldiia: just for funsies
[14:22:46] Attackroot: like in SL the first maw iterance wouldnt let the bfa neck work anymore.
[14:22:55] tronbadgames: they will probably just lock having covenant abilities to SL zones or SL chromie time specifically.
[14:22:55] reactive_author24: Yay
[14:23:15] PoohDump: just now checking out the alpha. have u tri3d the healing out?

[14:24:44] alex12645: LUL
[14:24:45] grumpnamedjosh: to be fair it wasnt just 45 seconds, you also took a few minutes to get the height needed to make that flight.
[14:24:49] Aidler: the DC islands
[14:24:57] ina_lurghu: care to show off soar?
[14:25:02] ina_lurghu: i wanna see it a bit more
[14:25:42] gairefear: How is the new race picking up? I was kinda dissapointed it only had 2 specs, 3 woulda been cool, a melee dragon form, a ranged magic form and a healer
[14:25:50] reactive_author24: I wonder how the raid looks like
[14:25:54] Strik3r019: @ina_lurghu it DCs u
[14:26:04] 7ndy7nderson: cooldown7 subscribed at Tier 1.

[14:26:48] AlphaSimply: suuurely
[14:26:52] novlen: lol of course your game is going to DC in an alpha
[14:26:53] Archrade: yah bugs are expected.
[14:26:59] Bigums: looks like a normal shuffle lol
[14:27:01] Hidden_Hybrid: the point in alpha is to break things so they know what to fix
[14:27:04] CYNIC308: its probably setting off the anti-speed hack detector
[14:27:08] osatox: might just be random or coincidence , but also with the game being built on momentum from live/retail too
[14:27:16] MoJoShMaN: that character model actually looks dope
[14:27:16] GalvinW: What kind of dance is that?
[14:27:21] Roboboooty: dracJAM

[14:39:50] metavahn231: in fact its de-evolving to go back to a better time
[14:39:51] Austei: bar*
[14:39:52] Sharkfeet: It did indeed DreamWebb
[14:40:11] Lostdogal: what's the new philosophy?
[14:40:13] toobaked1987: Is tier not lumped into borrowed power?

[14:40:32] Draco_wolfstein: its going to be its own thing
[14:40:37] Austei: the talents remind me of rift.
[14:40:47] Rabiahtaro132: Its like a combination of the good things of both talent systems.
[14:40:50] toobaked1987: I guess everyone will have their tier in DF, so yea.
[14:40:54] Myndjestyr: it is borrowed power though

[14:41:04] Meakis: IMO if there is a next tier to be replaced with, it isn't borrowed power
[14:41:05] anialigned: how you enjoying the alpha experience overall so far?
[14:41:07] erbthree: i want my artifact back
[14:41:18] tronbadgames: borrowed power was never a problem, it was the systems associated with it, the time gating, non-account wide aspects and of course it only being meaningful for the current expansion
[14:41:23] CaffinatedCoffee: Every patch is borrowed power cause you lose it all the next
[14:41:37] Chizy1991: Chizy1991 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! heyo thanks for the big stream
[14:41:52] Grystor: If tier gives you a unique power/abilities that you lose without it and miss, then it's borrowed power.  But normally it doesn't do that.
[14:41:54] gairefear: Do we have any time frame on the preliminary talent trees for the other classes?
[14:41:55] Sacura_Shadow: oh thats interesting
[14:41:56] Molvonos: SindragOHsa

[14:42:20] Hidden_Hybrid: as long as i dont have to spend hundreds of hours doing crap i dont enjoy to unlock talent points it looks good
[14:42:24] TheCliffyShow: If you're into black elves then Sindragosa is the dragon for you.
[14:42:27] Aidler: with 10.0 i was hoping for much more. what we got is just a hopefully very good but normal expansion
[14:42:55] Myndjestyr: isnt sindragosa dead

[14:45:22] cptrogers123: u can only get to 67 no? @Towelliee

[14:45:30] Usagi_Hami: where is Sindragosa D:
[14:45:33] DreamWebb: i wish there was a wireless G600
[14:45:34] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: love my g502
[14:45:40] Zyricks: Naga for the last 15yrs. Will never change from it
[14:45:43] Hidden_Hybrid: i have been using naga's for so long other mice dont feel good in my hand
[14:45:44] Moskeebee: @GriFFFoN_ZGZ same
[14:45:49] Metalcalfe: The g600 buttons don't wear out in 6 months like the naga
[14:45:55] metavahn231: scimitar for me has been a way more reliable naga but just more expensive
[14:46:02] Kyettcetera: Third button takes some serious getting used to, but it's really helpful, and I love the overall feel of the mouse.
[14:46:16] DreamWebb: i just turn the 3rd button off on the G600
[14:46:18] abracka_: i never liked the feeling of the scimitar. naga or this g600 are perfect though
[14:46:19] DarkVoid507: after my naga poops out ill try the g600 since its cheap but i went through 2 scimitar pros and both broke in less than a year
[14:46:41] Roaringkittylol: Ooh that Razer Naga Pro would be perfect for easy 1-2-3 sheeps 1-2-3 counterspell
[14:46:47] metavahn231: naga's are toys
[14:46:47] lockedspells: Been using the same Naga Epic since Cataclysm, only problem with it is the left click doubles every now and again. But i dont like textured buttons so mines the old flat version.
[14:46:59] DarkVoid507: only good thing about the scimitar is the buttons can slide to fit you but everything else sucks
[14:47:00] Fygmynt: @DarkVoid507 was it the scroll wheel?
[14:47:04] metavahn231: that break in 2 weeks for me lol
[14:47:10] DarkVoid507: @DarkVoid507 left click, both times
[14:47:13] Hidden_Hybrid: naga's usually last me a year or two

[14:48:53] lockedspells: dont get me wrong,i have to clean mine like every 3-6 months, dead skin or just debris in general from cat/otherwise, but if you take it apart and clean it, i've had my naga well into the 8-10 year range
[14:48:56] AlphaSimply: the new one with the replacesable sides broke on me within a month
