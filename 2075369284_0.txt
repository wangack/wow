[0:19:38] whiskeyhide: dorki hows the lambo

[0:19:41] Neruan: tbh doing 9h of ANYTHING will drian you
[0:19:50] Morayeden: defending bad takes is separate from liking the person
[0:19:54] tzahhh: you're very smart
[0:20:02] tykus21: thank you
[0:20:05] Harleybane: it's fine, streamers can have their moment LUL once the world goes to shit they are gonna be clueless and im happy about that
[0:20:07] dknamey: firstGarf
[0:20:08] Muffin_55: to be fair hasan did get clip chimped out of context. he was just talking about social battery. not how hard it actually was

[0:21:44] IAmSolari: To be fair, Asmon comments on a LOT of things he has no knowledge about
[0:21:46] t4pekid: how does it feel to be a 400 view streamer rn?

[0:23:51] relimee0: warlock
[0:23:52] Ajatus: the rogue talent tree is literally asking for another plagueborer strat
[0:23:52] zachl_: @101g find an emuffin like ventor and jr
[0:23:54] ratgefingah: with music?

[0:26:13] Caysadia: seems a little power creepy no
[0:26:19] Denz_9: there are choice nodes
[0:26:27] Ajatus: @Caysadia that is literally the point
[0:26:32] ratgefingah: Adge
[0:26:34] Ajatus: we level up we get more power
[0:26:37] Lacee666: CognitiveOverload
[0:27:04] miyo2322: I hate how great this could be and how right you are that one cookie cutter choice will be decided upon by the community and you will be called a troll if you don't follow it NotLikeThis
[0:27:13] IAmSolari: I hate moonkins
[0:27:21] b34v3rbr0: "lunar calling" seems so degenerate
[0:28:27] MierkaBlue: lunar calling guardian - sounds super strong, boomy - wtf
[0:28:28] Harken121: if its arcane dmg they have a talent that makes it self healing
[0:28:31] ChilledPenguinn: bear has a talent that makes you heal for a % of arcane damage dealt too i think
[0:29:56] MrAndersen_: the other boomkin tree has was it 5% DR from regrowth? and this one is 3% avoidance
[0:29:57] Viisionz74: bear is niche
[0:30:08] frejaclueless: I love convoke but
[0:30:17] frejaclueless: reads like it still wont compete with incarn lol
[0:30:19] Ajatus: the lunar calling boomy is play style altering cause you never go solar eclipse anymore
[0:30:32] whiskeyhide: im glad it doesnt look like you gotta find new keybinds for these
[0:30:36] IAmSolari: I'm dating someone who is 52, I'm 25... Is that weird
[0:30:37] Hyvest: yo
[0:30:48] whiskeyhide: HUH
[0:30:49] BigTrout3: and they're not supposed to majorly change how the spec plays too.
[0:30:53] Nitruos: I SAID THAT
[0:30:56] Nitruos: mr streamer
[0:31:10] PsydfexRein: i miss the live action cat facecam
[0:31:13] frejaclueless: that sounds sick
[0:31:24] Nitruos: another hot for mastery pepega
[0:31:26] Anathenma: Bleed damage? HUHH
[0:31:30] MieLULe: @yumytv Marcelian shitted omega hard on these hero specs because of they just dont fit game lore
[0:31:42] thargonian: shyyPog new talents
[0:31:45] yctnm: many question HMM
[0:31:47] thargonian: Kappa
[0:31:48] wanik90: you get both there’s talents later in that overlap then
[0:32:08] Nitruos: ya node good
[0:32:12] Neruan: switch to cat for better gos 4Head
[0:32:12] taulion199: 4 dps comps rising
[0:32:13] Ajatus: sit cat form after your ramp for 5% healing buff KEKW
[0:32:20] AyeLoud: Hotdamn that's not half bad. Wonder what other healers are gonna get then
[0:32:22] Harleybane: maybe they want to kill catweaving?
[0:32:29] spivet: the choice nodes look different, you get both
[0:32:30] thargonian: Thats a lot of damage KEKW
[0:32:31] ortemismw: you get all the nodes afaik
[0:32:31] Nitruos: u get both, the others have specs listed for ones that are restricted
[0:32:31] Keppie__: Is there a chance you put all of your hots out do big ramp and then go into cat form?
[0:32:35] MierkaBlue: I feel even those 4% nodes can be super-strong 10% feels real big
[0:32:42] Ajatus: @Harleybane this is buffing catweaving
[0:32:44] costcohotdogenjoyer: hello gamers
[0:32:48] Lottinius: thats nuts
[0:32:58] yoimdave: is this system kinda like azerite power?
[0:33:09] Ziupau: more buffs and shit to track monkaS
[0:33:40] yoimdave: i just really hope this shit doesnt change the game too drastically
[0:33:48] Nitruos: this tree seemed really strong
[0:33:53] playyDead: wait bond with nature is good with feral
[0:33:59] thargonian: And it scales with gear right? So its even more crit? @yumytv
[0:34:02] bhomsxo: @yoimdave they are just new talents
[0:34:04] AyeLoud: and dps goes up
[0:34:06] Caysadia: BLOOMER
[0:34:21] playyDead: just makes you so much easier to heal from raid CDs like AG and AMZ
[0:34:23] Ziupau: it kinda feels like resto gets to double dip in this tree
[0:34:27] Nitruos: so good
[0:34:56] Lottinius: guess that settles it that im playing my druid huh
[0:35:22] IAmSolari: is bear tank saved?
[0:36:02] Nitruos: ya they cant make more buttons
[0:36:11] PsydfexRein: fucking more buttons reee
[0:36:16] Ajatus: you just do your normal thing and get extra hot/dot procs for free basically
[0:36:25] PsydfexRein: i dont wanna bind more stuff lol
[0:36:30] Ajatus: @PsydfexRein its literally all passive
[0:36:36] PsydfexRein: im talking about another spec
[0:36:45] Ajatus: thats on you for not playing rdruid then
[0:36:50] PsydfexRein: real
[0:36:54] thargonian: WoW is already complicated enough
[0:37:07] Nitruos: hots good dots good
[0:37:18] zachl_: not to be dobby but its not this
[0:37:19] b34v3rbr0: new wow players in the war within WAYTOODANK
[0:37:23] zachl_: trees are overtuned as it is
[0:37:30] zachl_: the other tree just gonna juice them
[0:37:38] dknamey: druid class discord MONKA
[0:38:05] thargonian: Druid discord shyyDepressed
[0:38:14] Ziupau: tldr is passive hots
[0:38:15] MierkaBlue: ye
[0:38:31] thargonian: Yep I got you perfectly fine
[0:38:33] MierkaBlue: more passive procs and then stuff happens
[0:38:39] Ajatus: this literally doesnt change anything about how you actively play and make decisions its just nice passive juice
[0:38:58] AyeLoud: Well you'll get small things like 1 regrowth every 6 secs but that ain't half bad
[0:38:59] Ziupau: just buff/modifier bloat
[0:39:32] Nitruos: they need 10 bc 10 levels
[0:39:33] Nitruos: :^)
[0:39:34] goesidd: dont make me remember bfa
[0:39:36] goesidd: very rude
[0:39:36] Ajatus: because it has to stretch out the leveling process of 1 node per level from 70 to 80
[0:39:46] Thoreya: they did it to replace talents from 70-80
[0:39:57] Pyrrha_GG: they said you are going to be able to collapse it so that you only see the choice nodes
[0:40:09] evantengu147: herald of the sun lookin uhhh...
[0:40:12] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: the hero talents sound kinda cool but they all seem kinda lame
[0:40:23] b34v3rbr0: herald of the sun is cracked, wth were they smoking
[0:40:23] Izkatu: YEP
[0:40:25] whiskeyhide: YEP
[0:40:26] zachl_: kinda yea
[0:40:27] gfvaris: FUCK EM
[0:40:27] smashi_tv: YEP
[0:40:27] costcohotdogenjoyer: yes
[0:40:27] dknamey: yes me :)
[0:40:29] Thoreya: yes
[0:40:32] TerraTuned: @yumytv i'm willing to pay just so i dont level
[0:40:34] Ziupau: It'd just be better at 1 node every 2 levels at 5 total
[0:40:34] spivet: not twitch chatters but absolutely yes
[0:40:35] Lothland: Leveling serves no purpose anymore
[0:40:37] PsydfexRein: evryone lyin
[0:40:39] TaterTacoTots: leveling is just an obstacle to playing the game @yumytv
[0:40:44] Tarithal: No shot lmao
[0:40:45] MierkaBlue: @TaterTacoTots this
[0:40:48] PsydfexRein: leveled my fomo class in 1 day with TW
[0:40:49] Galois_rg: leveling is the main form of content for most players
[0:40:50] BigTrout3: my first thought was in cataclysm where you got a talent point every other level
[0:40:52] badfo: that's like 75 percent of my friends that play
[0:40:54] costcohotdogenjoyer: YEP im elite :)
[0:40:57] Ajatus: no but im bringing it up as the systemic reason its not 'just 4 nodes' as you were saying it could be
[0:40:57] spivet: A lot of my casual friends who come back for the xpac only level to max and do like 5 dungeons then leave till the next xpac
[0:40:58] thargonian: This is just new nodes for the ske of it. They literly could have just given these as a flat buff to druid and moved on. @yumytv
[0:40:58] Morayeden: correct
[0:40:59] b34v3rbr0: EZ elite players
[0:41:00] baseboned: I like leveling I wish it took longer
[0:41:02] Pyrrha_GG: i think blizz is really connected to people gaining power as you level
[0:41:04] tantbrilla: it takes me 4-6 business weeks to level 1 guy and i have like 25 characters
[0:41:07] Broncosthi: Ly
[0:41:12] Pyrrha_GG: even if leveling isnt really impactful
[0:41:13] goesidd: have u ever gone out into the open zones
[0:41:13] Thoreya: it would feel like shit if u get nothing for 10 lvls
[0:41:15] Thoreya: in a new expac
[0:41:17] amaterasunam: leveling is ass
[0:41:17] Izkatu: For me YEP
[0:41:19] goesidd: some weird people in this game
[0:41:22] BigTrout3: it'll always be weird to me to not experience the full spec at max level
[0:41:25] 1cxlo: If you care about leveling just play classic
[0:41:26] Morayeden: Leveling is an archaic system
[0:41:32] Joetrus: Despairge
[0:41:33] Pyrrha_GG: dead game
[0:41:33] Ziupau: 40h per level Pog
[0:41:34] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: lvling is fun when a new expansion comes out
[0:41:35] costcohotdogenjoyer: they go back to classic length to get to max lvl
[0:41:35] baseboned: YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
[0:41:36] b34v3rbr0: Despairge
[0:41:37] thargonian: Please no
[0:41:42] Broncosthi: Absolutely not
[0:41:42] WildiFan420: leveling is so chill for new players
[0:41:44] 1cxlo: True
[0:41:45] dknamey: baseg classic > retail
[0:41:45] Lacee666: FirstTimeChadder
[0:41:47] baseboned: 1-60 every expansion!
[0:41:52] BigTrout3: FirstTimeChadder
[0:41:53] jujumann35: slower doesn't mean better
[0:41:58] goesidd: i love to go between westfall and duskwood 47 times
[0:41:59] PsydfexRein: scaling zone levels ruins any leveling in retail
[0:42:00] badfo: its the same with regular talents. it could be half the size in most cases, but its designed to give you 1 small thing every level
[0:42:02] ratgefingah: play osrs YEP
[0:42:03] thargonian: Not anymore
[0:42:08] Pyrrha_GG: Classic is for a journey, Retail is for the destination
[0:42:10] b34v3rbr0: the lvling is just a tutorial for the end game in retail
[0:42:11] Lothland: 20 hours on the first char would be fine if it was like 3-5 for every alt :>
[0:42:19] goesidd: or booty bay to shimmering flats 150 times
[0:42:30] amaterasunam: true
[0:42:31] spivet: they wanted to add more talent points without messing up the existing trees, so this is the middle path
[0:42:34] yctnm: Thank you for flying Air Dracthyr. I am your scalecommander today. Buckle in. monkaSTEER
[0:42:35] PsydfexRein: yes paladin
[0:42:35] autumnbugle: that was a fun seeming tree
[0:42:38] PsydfexRein: lets joe
[0:42:39] b34v3rbr0: PepeLaugh
[0:42:40] costcohotdogenjoyer: DAYMAN FIGHTER OF THE NIGHTMAN
[0:42:41] Wiseved: PepeLa
[0:42:42] Upsidedownsmiling: @yumytv your looking cute and not fat today :)
[0:42:47] dergNwolf: the devastation tree actually looks kinda neat I think
[0:42:49] dergNwolf: tippiComfy
[0:42:56] Pyrrha_GG: yeah, placeable buffs
[0:43:04] aiv_: santa claus tree
[0:43:04] BigTrout3: light sword or light shield. very jank
[0:43:10] Wiseved: Hope you like beams PepeLoser
[0:43:11] thargonian: Honestly they should just make a short quest campaign that takes a few hours to complete and if you do it it boosts you to lvl 70. There Done.
[0:43:18] Drohgoh: ETERNAL FLAME IS BACK BABY
[0:43:20] b34v3rbr0: WAYTOODANK
[0:43:20] Drohgoh: HPAL IS SOOOO BACK
[0:43:28] Pyrrha_GG: these ones seem fun from a ret perspective tho if people want to know
[0:43:38] TwicksTV: @Drohgoh u tryna push in s1 war within?
[0:43:50] goesidd: he is now
[0:43:52] MrAndersen_: oh no are these stationary? did they not learn from consecrate
[0:44:07] Nitruos: this sunspot shit is a direct steal from destiny2 btw

[0:44:25] thargonian: Thats HOT KEKW
[0:44:35] Pyrrha_GG: @Nitruos these are debuffs not static fields
[0:44:46] Wiseved: Holy Nova 2.0
[0:44:58] baseboned: becuse ret needed to be burstyer at start of combat?
[0:45:21] Xuraell: Classsic woo
[0:45:22] aiv_: HOT pally xD
[0:45:22] Nitruos: the mane and effect are the fukin same shit
[0:45:23] PsydfexRein: very descriptive
[0:45:26] Nitruos: name*
[0:45:30] TaterTacoTots: Man, they're doing protection dirty giving holy flame to ret/holy when it's always been prot
[0:45:30] Izkatu: hot pally
[0:45:31] Neruan: back to MoP LUL
[0:45:40] drdrozd12: i have been waiting for this day for years
[0:46:00] KDaily: catJam reading music
[0:46:00] Nightbot: catJAM
[0:46:21] njokkio: so this entire tree is hpriest mastery?
[0:46:29] thargonian: @tatertacotots Thats what you get for being prot Kappa
[0:46:58] Ziupau: pvp node
[0:47:26] MrAndersen_: is prism 30s?
[0:47:45] tagzin_: @MrAndersen_ 20s
[0:47:46] Hyvest: prism 20
[0:47:46] thargonian: No KEKW
[0:47:48] Pyrrha_GG: wings does
[0:47:49] Hyvest: wings
[0:47:59] TaterTacoTots: 2 HP spenders after prism @yumytv
[0:48:37] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: geometry gameplay
[0:48:41] baseboned: that sounds dope looking
[0:48:41] thargonian: Thats so inpractical
[0:48:44] evantengu147: I hate this
[0:48:44] mikkelrw: So Sunspots are GIGA glimmer or am i missing something?
[0:48:49] Ziupau: beam gameplay sounds kinda cringe
[0:48:51] evantengu147: sunspots are totems
[0:48:51] fat_european0: this sounds lit
[0:49:11] b34v3rbr0: "guys run around in circles when I pop wings, I gotta parse" Okayge
[0:49:11] costcohotdogenjoyer: sunspots? more like sundumbs! am i right chat?
[0:49:17] Neruan: more power into spenders than glimmer thats the tree in a nutshell
[0:49:19] guzy44: omega damage for holy paladin
[0:49:19] thargonian: People will not run into the spots
[0:49:24] BigTrout3: double down on glimmer and ditch caster pally PauseChamp
[0:49:34] evantengu147: relying on people standing in something is the worst gameplay ever
[0:49:47] tagzin_: it is
[0:49:47] evantengu147: wowhead said it's something on the ground
[0:49:50] MrAndersen_: PepeLa
[0:49:51] criselbart: it is on people
[0:49:51] Alkomz: it's on targets
[0:49:56] goesidd: it says on ur target not under the target
[0:50:21] Ajatus: wowhead is assuming they straight copied D2 i think
[0:50:23] Pyrrha_GG: it says on, but who knows, static spots would be turbo cringe
[0:50:24] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: ok so no one knows exactly
[0:50:27] MrAndersen_: maybe the sunspot moves with the target
[0:50:32] thargonian: Well it Said they have to pass through it so If I missunderstood im sorry.
[0:50:34] Daamian94: anyone knows if we are choosing one branch of those hero trees or we can take all?
[0:50:38] goesidd: maybe it moves with time slowly
[0:50:39] baseboned: all
[0:50:42] blacklight_____: pretty sure it’s like solar beam
[0:50:47] Izkatu: we didnt know yet .  but i think its on target
[0:50:49] Ajatus: @thargonian thats the beam portion only
[0:50:52] sundihyr: sunspot will just be a buff on the targets and that's it, no way it's thing on the ground
[0:51:02] dustin_handsupdb: @Daamian94 you end up being able to take all it seems
[0:51:02] Pyrrha_GG: @Daamian94 you can talk all node, only restrictions are that some are choice nodes
[0:51:03] Ziupau: imagine ur hpala shooting around extra swirlies on the floor holy that sounds aids
[0:51:06] Ajatus: @yumytv read rogue real quick
[0:51:21] yumytv: https://www.wowhead.com/news/8-new-hero-talent-trees-revealed-first-rogue-and-warlock-trees-all-paladin-trees-337854
[0:51:23] costcohotdogenjoyer: more shit on the ground i have to pay attention too holy sleeper
[0:51:49] Lacee666: Bedge ?
[0:51:54] goesidd: mutytv
[0:51:57] wonkus1: lmao
[0:51:58] b34v3rbr0: muted? PepeLa
[0:52:00] raye_gaming22: eternal flame aids is back wow
[0:52:01] MrAndersen_: 1m
[0:52:02] fizzleqt: xddPeat
[0:52:03] BigTrout3: PepeLa
[0:52:27] Kalatastz: people cant be trusted to stay in them
[0:52:48] costcohotdogenjoyer: Where shaman talents :(
[0:52:49] fat_european0: These trees seemed kinda underwhelming
[0:53:00] drdrozd12: the other one was called ''trash''
[0:53:11] Grimshottv: any1 else who gave up on DF?
[0:53:12] nightbreeze93: chat someone fill me in what are we hating Madge
[0:53:13] Wiseved: Its not on the ground, its multiple links from you towards the ppl with the buff and ppl need to stand in those links during ur wings
[0:53:18] MrAndersen_: poroPls
[0:53:24] Izkatu: shaman monks and dh no talents Cryge
[0:53:42] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: it sounds so cringe KEKW
[0:53:44] Nitruos: im already lost
[0:53:47] Nitruos: fk thiis tree
[0:53:51] nightbreeze93: what that sounds pog
[0:53:53] BigTrout3: overcooked
[0:54:00] b34v3rbr0: WHOLETHIMCOOK
[0:54:15] costcohotdogenjoyer: DIESOFCRINGE picking things up
[0:54:19] miyo2322: that shit is a skip
[0:54:27] stagnate92: i think this tree solely depends on armament tuning
[0:54:29] frejaclueless: Trickster sounded pretty boring? Any rogues in chat
[0:54:34] thargonian: WAYTOODANK
[0:54:37] costcohotdogenjoyer: @frejaclueless JPC said it's garbo
[0:54:48] Lacee666: they seem so random just give us a new ability
[0:54:56] Ajatus: @Wiseved but realistically you just have ur sunspots on the party already and they are automatically within the lines since they are the links
[0:55:02] Lothland: just what outlaw needed, another buff to play around <.<
[0:55:09] miyo2322: blizz thinking they're PoE, gotta read a fucking novel to understand each ability when it's really just simple mechanics we've been having for years
[0:55:14] fat_european0: It's kinda hard to create something big when the base talent trees already take up so much "space", for a lack of better words
[0:55:15] BigTrout3: @frejaclueless as a mid rogue, outlaw seems to not benefit because they don't benefit from mastery and they'd waste globals to keep a maintainence buff up
[0:55:15] Grimshottv: i don't want choice nodes gimme 1 build for m+ and raid and im happy
[0:55:15] wonkus1: hero talents seem overcomplicated
[0:55:18] thargonian: So many dead nodes/trees in these.
[0:55:19] PsydfexRein: dont say that lol
[0:55:23] thargonian: Sadge
[0:55:23] stagnate92: If anything, should choose flavor talents from the other specs and make that the hero talent
[0:55:25] waelrick: monk hero talents nerdCheck
[0:55:27] Ultratoasted: It's a subclass type of thing
[0:55:28] fuyrae: So glad they nuked that Priest shit
[0:55:37] KDaily: I still like the light smith tree, could be cool
[0:55:40] PsydfexRein: just make them cosmetic
[0:55:42] zachl_: im a huge non liker of these. gonna create an ever bigger gap between the best and worst healer
[0:55:42] thargonian: YEP
[0:55:46] zachl_: another cog in the wheel to tune
[0:55:49] zachl_: im not a fan
[0:55:57] costcohotdogenjoyer: yeah you're just gonna go to your class discord and pick what the gigabrains decide
[0:56:00] Grimshottv: @zachl_
[0:56:02] Hymmer: catJAM
[0:56:02] Nightbot: catJAM
[0:56:04] fuyrae: Like old talents
[0:56:09] fat_european0: So basically old talent trees within the new system LUL
[0:56:12] Grimshottv: @zachl_ same its shit overall
[0:56:18] kroshgor: rogue tree is horrible
[0:56:19] dustin_handsupdb: The hero talent trees should be 1 starter node, 3 choice nodes, and 1 final node - 5 points over 10 levels
[0:56:19] Lothland: A lot of the "choice" nodes see to have an obvious best
[0:56:20] MrAndersen_: "deep Breath and Breath of Eons an now be steered..." TakingNotes
[0:56:22] Wiseved: @Ajatus for keys it wont matter anyhow since it will prolly do neglible healing ,for raid its gonna be a shitshow doe KEKW
[0:56:22] frejaclueless: @BigTrout3 yeaaa was thinking the same thing, also I haven't played killing spree ever yet so
[0:56:27] scherri5: so bfa talents?
[0:56:27] Lothland: *seem too
[0:56:28] thargonian: Last time we got that was covenants and then people still played the best one
[0:56:39] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: would  be cooler to just give the original trees 5 more points ezy
[0:56:39] Ajatus: @Wiseved nobody gives a fuck about raid though
[0:56:54] miyo2322: I'm just waiting for the shaman hero talents because I already know they'll be the most disappointing ones out of all the healers
[0:57:02] astrinovska: same
[0:57:20] criselbart: all those tiny talents doing a bazillion miniscule healing events kinda suck
[0:57:28] costcohotdogenjoyer: @miyo2322 i guarantee they try to make enhance a pseudo support via hero talents
[0:57:35] thargonian: The game doesn't need more buttons
[0:57:42] Epsicade: yeah, just give me an option for 5%, 7% or 8% more healing
[0:57:46] dustin_handsupdb: no class should get more than 1 new active, some even get 2 passives, then let 3 choice nodes be the things that make the difference
[0:57:51] jeroome___: current trees should be like that. way more nodes specific to abilities with less points
[0:58:01] dimsy__: no poe is different :)
[0:58:27] Kalatastz: in poe ur realistically picking from a handful of big nodes not really looking at the small ones
[0:58:28] BigTrout3: it feels like to me it's either MoP-style talents of just 6 decisions, or PoE trees. anything in-between will always be "this tree is best, copy-paste"
[0:58:30] dimsy__: ye
[0:58:49] Hyvest: Holy Shock has 30 interactions with it so the spell itself does nothing (delete glimmer)
[0:58:53] Lacee666: true
[0:59:13] banditrox12: Waffle cat weekly this week?
[0:59:20] costcohotdogenjoyer: TRUE
[0:59:45] Lothland: MW button bloat go go
[0:59:50] costcohotdogenjoyer: monk is that class
[0:59:55] Harken121: brewmaster the button lord
[0:59:56] frejaclueless: "the Button Lord" ICANT
[0:59:56] fat_european0: It goes against Blizzard's intended goal. They said they don't want any specs to have "piano openers"
[0:59:57] Milano___: Button lord LUL
[0:59:58] Afraithe: Key bloat is horrible, but I like that they are trying to fix it, like some of the set bonuses just removed some buttons by adding the effects
[1:00:01] Italicuss: any arpg
[1:00:02] Emm_Zee: I'm convinced that about 75% of the "all discs suck ass" crowd play in a way where not even zaelia on disc could keep them alive ICANT
[1:00:11] jenkinsdonuttv: I like the maddening complexity of fury warrior
[1:00:13] thargonian: @bigtrout3 Both PoE and MoP trees work like that what are you talking about. People will always optimise.
[1:00:16] crixes89: ive had decent disc priests in the 22 range, resto druids are my least favorite. Too busy trying to do that 100k dps in pugs instead of healing
[1:00:19] BigTrout3: devastation?
[1:00:28] Zilvaan: I just gave up in brew for that exact same reason. Way too much effort for no gain
[1:00:29] fat_european0: @yumytv You didn't play it, but it was the same in Legion. You had very few buttons in your rotation
[1:00:42] costcohotdogenjoyer: and dota has a button master (invoker)
[1:00:55] nightbreeze93: and yet i'm convinced if the hero buttons werent overcooked ppl would call em boring ICANT
[1:00:59] simon11111987: talent trees that are set or nodes with obvious choices might as well just be baked into the base spec
[1:01:02] Lacee666: Keepo
[1:01:14] MrAndersen_: Keepo Clap
[1:01:19] Kalatastz: Keepo
[1:01:20] thargonian: Aphelios Kappa
[1:01:30] BigTrout3: what about the dota hero where you control 16 mini heros?
[1:01:31] crixes89: can we all agree making interrupts and cc's a choice was a terrible idea lol
[1:01:32] costcohotdogenjoyer: me trying to perfectly micro my chen minions breaks my brain
[1:01:41] cixxay: yeah I gotcha, like yuumi
[1:01:47] yctnm: invoker when the order of quas wex exort mattered Aware
[1:01:48] zachl_: you tryna funnel me a rageheart or what
[1:01:51] baseboned: play geo
[1:02:05] baseboned: play hardcore
[1:02:08] dknamey: it still matter
[1:02:14] costcohotdogenjoyer: it for sure matters
[1:02:16] dimsy__: DendiFace
[1:02:28] pandaman7411: what new hero talents came out
[1:02:32] baseboned: play Legend of Zelda Link to the Past randomizer
[1:02:38] thargonian: @crixes89 CC should be baseline and there should be less types of CC in the game imho.
[1:02:38] yctnm: it matters for the amount of them, but the actual order of them don't matter like it use to
[1:02:47] Melancholy_Mode: It has not mattered in forever, it used to be that like QEE was a different spell than EQE

[6:08:12] IAmSolari: @RamblingJosh_ same shit with havoc, it's really good but people are probably bored or it/ there are other alternatives to it after class balance changes
[6:08:40] Ovi_Gr8: is dzy euro

[6:11:11] rokuu91: he has to fix his sleeping pattern first before his vuhdo profile
[6:11:23] othernewname: MONKA
[6:11:25] theskot: that rock had you lol
[6:11:44] MierkaBlue: how arre you alive?
[6:11:46] bojackhorseman2004: No i mean, the "bug" when other people try to downloiad it and the ignore list dosnt carry over.  for debuffs
[6:11:57] xxjameskingxx71: lol
[6:12:01] MierkaBlue: KEKW
[6:12:03] Its_Stuart: OMEGALUL
[6:12:11] nightbreeze93: he got arcane int just as the rock hit him xdd no stun swirly
[6:12:14] jonnbezo: LOL
[6:12:15] bojackhorseman2004: I linked the fix on your discord
[6:12:16] wastedheals: KEKW
[6:12:19] Ajatus: ignore list never carried over
[6:12:32] fizzleqt: veryCat
[6:13:01] Tarithal: catBop figure it out moment
[6:13:05] Hyvest: firedup is hilarious
[6:13:09] RamblingJosh_: Avade wanted a flank attack
[6:13:16] MierkaBlue: GotCaughtTrolling
[6:13:36] itscharlas: I bet releasing is the play. they forgot to pull the mobs at the bottom
[6:14:16] bojackhorseman2004: Yes, but how does a bad/new player know what is important to track and not? if you implement my fix it be easier for everyone using your profile :)
[6:14:22] wastedheals: xddPeat its not safe btw
[6:14:33] Ajatus: @bojackhorseman2004 if ur bad dont use vuhdo
[6:14:38] bojackhorseman2004: :(
[6:14:40] Ajatus: much simpler
[6:14:44] rokuu91: sus
[6:16:02] bojackhorseman2004: There are suprisingly much
[6:16:04] bojackhorseman2004: Like forberence
[6:16:10] bojackhorseman2004: certian abilities being on cd
[6:16:17] bojackhorseman2004: trinkets that acts as debuffs
[6:16:19] Cooldeano: !ui
[6:16:20] Nightbot: Addon list here: https://justpaste.it/5pvuo NEW UI vid: https://youtu.be/_cn344NOZd8 .New Exports here: https://linktr.ee/yumytv
[6:16:32] bojackhorseman2004: if you look at your own ignore list you will find more than a few things
[6:16:40] Ajatus: bro its not that deep
[6:17:02] RamblingJosh_: Your always going to have to make your own modifications, good chance to learn how to use vuhdo lol
[6:17:27] bojackhorseman2004: Thats why people look to streamers and see that their setup fits what they want
[6:17:35] bojackhorseman2004: and want to just copy it
[6:17:35] hunterzx: I don't understand why on elvui so many debuffs don't show by default for me. had to whitelist them 1 by 1
[6:17:43] Ajatus: @bojackhorseman2004 and thats bad
[6:17:44] Ajatus: dont do that
[6:17:50] bojackhorseman2004: and when you can implement a fix why not do it?
[6:18:27] Hyvest: ElvUI hides irrelevant debuffs by default (also hides the sand debuff in fall by default for some reason though), no reason to go VuhDo if you don't know how to use it
[6:18:43] Hyvest: And if you wanna use it, watch Meg's guide on how to do things yourself
[6:18:54] bojackhorseman2004: But thanks for making your profile with what it is and making it free, i just wanted to suggest this one fix which would make it much easier and seamless
[6:18:55] JakobLowrizzle: i miss panda monk
[6:18:56] bojackhorseman2004: hope you consider it :)
[6:19:25] rokuu91: yumytvYEP yumytvYEP yumytvYEP
[6:19:38] hunterzx: @Hyvest some aoe pulsing damage debuffs in raid, at least 1 other bleed in rise as well
[6:19:50] xxjameskingxx71: here comes spiteful
[6:20:14] bojackhorseman2004: I hope i dont come out as ungratefull, many streamers have paid UI downloads
[6:20:35] jandemain: at how many targets should you be spinning?
[6:21:02] itscharlas: how does that shadow bolt volley tech work? Do you taunt mid cast and then meld?
[6:21:09] Ajatus: yes
[6:21:34] Ajatus: it makes him recast and if you make him go to the 3rd cast you get the health buff before it finishes
[6:22:27] MythrikX: @jandemain Meg / Ellesmere say at 5 or more
[6:22:42] HarveyPls: the non tank taunts, the tank melds, then during recast non tank melds
[6:22:57] HarveyPls: non tank taunts during cast*
[6:23:03] microkitty7: You running yu'lons grace?
[6:23:14] jandemain: @MythrikX ok ty
[6:23:38] microkitty7: Gotcha thanks
[6:23:39] bojackhorseman2004: Thats such a cool thing to know
[6:23:42] itscharlas: Yeah, I figured out the point. It was confusing me because usually if you taunt mid cast, the target of the cast doesn't change
[6:23:43] hunterzx: i think its crazier that even with that, classes are so strong defensivesly that they don't die
[6:23:44] theskot: why does YLG get a super buff here
[6:23:47] Aandromega: I downloaded your UI at the start of the patch and modded it, I love my UI now thanks growl :)
[6:23:52] itscharlas: But I guess it's aoe so it just stops anyway
[6:23:56] MierkaBlue: @yumytv I failed my first ever 26 tonight with less than 2 minutes overtime. <3 I have never done this high keys before so thank you for the inspiration! yumytvLove
[6:23:57] spacecow5: How did you do that fight before that trick was found?
[6:24:11] Hyvest: xdd
[6:24:17] Ajatus: @itscharlas the tank melds the first cast so you dont want the target to update yet
[6:24:54] IAttackYou: @MierkaBlue Growl doesn't even respond to my message any more cus half of them are troll baits
[6:24:56] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[6:25:00] itscharlas: where are greater shadow protection potions when you need them in retail
[6:25:12] nightbreeze93: half Susge
[6:25:19] Razdruid: lmao
[6:25:19] IAttackYou: yeh
[6:25:19] wastedheals: xdd
[6:25:21] discomancer1: some day we'll have a season that doesn't require night elf or dwarf CopiumTime
[6:25:24] Gambit2012: well are you gonna?
[6:25:27] Aandromega: How is your transmog actually good wth
[6:25:29] epilepticunicorn_: growl doesnt respond to me either when i tell him to play sod
[6:25:30] Hyvest: the other half were "where is hiii "
[6:25:33] Vyndrodis: Attack truly losing it ever since we lost hiii
[6:25:40] Razdruid: yeah he reads all my trolling and just ignores me 95% of the time :) you get used to it haha
[6:25:44] t4pekid: OHIO
[6:25:45] IAttackYou: yeah, my mind is shot
[6:25:49] Mjawwww: you killed the panda? D:
[6:25:54] yaellian: Well everything looks good on a female night elf, so that helps LUL
[6:25:59] dango0n: yo growl, balatro when?
[6:26:11] IAttackYou: Cryge . o O ( wildigBench )
[6:26:14] Ajatus: wait growl actually used xmog?
[6:26:14] bojackhorseman2004: I think trolling in chat is fun, but sometimes i wonder if it dosnt always come across the way meant and it can be negative to the streamer
[6:26:15] Valanya11: balatro PauseChamp
[6:26:19] Lenzoface: imfiredup key comeback? Pog
[6:26:19] t4pekid: ok on a serious not tho unban hiii
[6:26:22] bojackhorseman2004: There are allot of streamers who struggle with mental health
[6:26:22] Valanya11: we're balatro mains now
[6:26:23] MierkaBlue: no no, I have gotten to timing 24's and 25's now and that was my first ever 26 (unsurprisingly not in time), so hey - I'm actually pushing this season first time ever! I'll never be like top keys or mdi but it is great fun.
[6:26:32] dorki: I think trolling in chat is fun, but sometimes i wonder if it dosnt always come across the way meant and it can be negative to the streamer
[6:26:38] IAttackYou: @t4pekid Zach already offered to add it back for me and I declined ayayaxdd
[6:26:39] wastedheals: BedgeCat RaidProc
[6:26:54] dorki: streaming drains your mental health
[6:26:56] unbelieversc2: mugged by twitch chat /s
[6:26:56] Emm_Zee: Stand outside first boss room on "accident" and send a quick balatro run while your group does the boss EZ
[6:26:58] vondahanner: Dorki trolling
[6:26:59] Shaundhi: Shaundhi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[6:27:04] t4pekid: @IAttackYou are you NUTS
[6:27:06] nightbreeze93: dorki couldn't function without trolling though Susge
[6:27:10] itscharlas: I timed my first 29 last season, then missed title cutoff by less than 1 keys worth of points because I absolutely hate VP and never did it above a 26
[6:27:10] wraghelm: Do you think that Nelf will be great next season or its just this season
[6:27:11] Tortellini13: chatting drains my social battery
[6:27:15] IAttackYou: I wanna see the world burn
[6:27:31] RamblingJosh_: depends a bit what kind of chat you cultivate, I imagine
[6:27:50] IAttackYou: I feel like you are talking about soup dorki
[6:27:52] selerf: if uldaman exists we'll ne dwarf for snake boss
[6:27:55] IAttackYou: didnt u perma soup
[6:28:00] nightbreeze93: yeah i think sometimes trolling does affect the streamer, but dont think in this one
[6:28:01] Valanya11: the amounts of trolls / mean people in this stream is incredibly low
[6:28:17] nightbreeze93: soup has been back for a while
[6:28:19] Vods: Yeah this is a very tame chat
[6:28:23] hunterzx: wow players have to endure lfg + pug life. our mental cannot be defeated by mere chatters
[6:28:30] itscharlas: What dungeons do you wanna see? I hope AV is back at least
[6:28:34] yaellian: Man I need S4 to come out. Nothing to do in WoW right now. I need that grind back
[6:28:42] itscharlas: uh oh
[6:28:44] IAttackYou: @hunterzx its the straw that broke the camel's back
[6:28:46] hunterzx: that would be like the world's greatest adventurer being slain by a stingray
[6:28:47] IAttackYou: it all adds up
[6:28:53] itscharlas: what did they do to AV? They spent months making it good
[6:28:53] IAttackYou: AV is garbage now
[6:28:56] IAttackYou: cus its straight linear
[6:28:57] bojackhorseman2004: The most toxic chat is in pvp streamers, from my personal experience. The back seating is insane
[6:29:01] IAttackYou: you cant jump anymore
[6:29:15] Aandromega: Would've been cool to vote on some dungeons like SL season 4
[6:29:54] itscharlas: Why would they remove AV jumps. RIP
[6:29:56] Tiggaar: Do you think it's a holy pally comeback next season
[6:30:16] IAttackYou: @itscharlas you have to do the dungeon way devs wanted it to be xddPeat
[6:30:19] bojackhorseman2004: Problem with voting is, its not sustainable. We all vote for the favorite dungeons then 3-4 seasons in we only got the shit dungeons left.
[6:30:23] bojackhorseman2004: they need to spread the shit and good
[6:30:30] itscharlas: Did some blizz employee queue into a random heroic AV and get flamed for not knowing the jump and said "never again"
[6:30:31] Aandromega: Halls of Infusion despairage
[6:30:47] IAttackYou: probably
[6:30:59] nightbreeze93: what would avade do OMEGALUL
[6:30:59] t4pekid: so when are you and dorki hitting ironforge gym?
[6:31:08] xxjameskingxx71: they just need to buff holy power spenders bc they are ass without dawn passive
[6:31:24] bojackhorseman2004: When i heal my next key i will apply that "what would Growl do"
[6:31:29] Aandromega: Uldaman feels like watching the entire lotr trilogy
[6:31:35] hunterzx: If they were to bring back tol dagor... do you think it would be worse than the average linear dungeon we have to deal with now?
[6:31:46] Emm_Zee: @bojackhorseman2004 o7
[6:31:55] t4pekid: yea ironforge looks so good, like scuffed as hell but still the idea is so good
[6:32:06] t4pekid: i hope they have longterm success with it
[6:32:13] IAttackYou: tol dagor had fun ass bosses
[6:32:22] Emm_Zee: Tol dagor is a good dungeon compared to some of the abominations we have now
[6:32:25] hunterzx: i loved the outside area at the beginning, the barres boss, and routes with obelisk was fun
[6:32:41] hunterzx: barrels* boss
[6:32:43] particles2: lets go bring back kr
[6:32:45] Hyvest: Sanguine and not being able to see shit because of tight corridors were my main issues with TD
[6:32:53] bojackhorseman2004: When people complain about dungeons, its hard to know if they are talking balance or actual dungeon.
[6:33:16] Emm_Zee: @hyvest when you pushed second boss too fast and he ran through sanguine xdd
[6:33:17] bojackhorseman2004: KR could come out super easy and it prob be a fun dungeon
[6:33:28] raye_gaming22: TD with the shitter beguiling mobs that you could kick back  pulled like 3 floors for no reason
[6:33:28] bojackhorseman2004: for most people
[6:33:36] Emm_Zee: I mean
[6:33:48] Emm_Zee: Sbg was just ass
[6:33:52] Valanya11: YEP buff warrior
[6:33:54] Ajatus: YEP buff rogue
[6:34:00] nightbreeze93: sbg was heaven for the weekly keyers tho
[6:34:20] naem_: SBG was the most boring shit ever
[6:34:43] dantucker: lmfao
[6:34:44] bojackhorseman2004: Why do people want defensives removed?
[6:34:45] Valanya11: KEKW
[6:34:46] Emm_Zee: In weeklys even in sbg a demon player could fuck up the run
[6:34:46] Tortellini13: he spittin
[6:34:48] Aandromega: Have you healed this boss on a 30 as MW yet?
[6:34:53] wraghelm: "Im worried I will not be fuckin broken anymore"
[6:34:54] shunsha: I only liked SBG because when I forgot about alt keys the entire week, I’d just jump in there
[6:35:00] Ajatus: HOLY gamer
[6:35:03] selerf: Bitch, you'll get compensated with a better game
[6:35:05] IAttackYou: thats some good garf
[6:35:08] hunterzx: it means balance is good, as long as my main class is still the best by a mile KEKG
[6:35:11] bojackhorseman2004: Isnt plenty of defensives and plenty of stuff you need to use defensive for more intresting gameplay? and it pushes the surviability more onto dps?
[6:35:12] particles2: dont listen to mages, they just trying to be the main character always
[6:35:14] nightbreeze93: i mean i also didn't like sbg but it was not all that hard and at the very least short
[6:35:14] spacecow5: I want my class to be the only one with defensives
[6:35:38] Hyvest: @bojackhorseman2004 in turn means healers have no agency and are literally cosmetic
[6:35:42] discomancer1: @spacecow5 also I'm the only one who can play my class
[6:35:45] hunterzx: @bojackhorseman2004 Consequence of that is with good play, people are so unkillable that the only way for them to die is get oneshot. Which makes healing + balance overall cancer
[6:36:31] Emm_Zee: It also sucks ass when you tune shit around 5 defensives, then a turbo banger spec like enhancer is shit just because it has one
[6:36:44] bojackhorseman2004: But most classes hasent gotten any more defensives since season 1? and season 1 was the  "healing season" healers where sweating and you knew if you had a good or bad one
[6:36:57] bojackhorseman2004: I think the current healing/lack off meta is just becuse of the dungeons we are playing
[6:36:59] Ajatus: @Emm_Zee acktually ur just supposed to sit dog form perma
[6:37:22] xxjameskingxx71: what if they just removed all self-healing abilitys and passives from no-healers?
[6:37:33] Ajatus: @bojackhorseman2004 every single class that got reworked got tankier
[6:38:02] nightbreeze93: enhance Sadge
[6:38:17] bojackhorseman2004: Tankier and active defense abilities are two different things.
[6:39:05] nightbreeze93: not really in practice tho
[6:39:32] nightbreeze93: i guess pala wears plate YEP
[6:39:40] Ajatus: ok but a lot of them got there through new active defensive buttons, like DH actually being able to take netherwalk
[6:39:58] Ajatus: mages new block
[6:39:59] bojackhorseman2004: They had netherwalk before current talent system
[6:40:07] bojackhorseman2004: they havent really gotten any new buttons?
[6:40:09] zachl_: but you could never use it
[6:40:14] zachl_: so nether is a new button
[6:40:19] zachl_: Shruge
[6:40:20] TripleXTN: gj growl
[6:40:25] zachl_: mage got mass barrier and ice cold
[6:40:31] hunterzx: MW as an example got like 5% more stamina, 40% passive DR, and like a active 15% hp shield. and 5 man shield on chiji
[6:40:33] Hyvest: What exacerbates the defensive issue is that healing is too strong. When you can top the group so quick the need to do super spiky damage profiles to threaten you
[6:40:40] Aandromega: It's a good boss imo
[6:40:54] nightbreeze93: haha rogue laughs in 15s cd feint hahha
[6:41:00] Hyvest: Instead of choosing who to heal you just keep everyone 100% all the time
[6:41:07] Ajatus: @nightbreeze93 2x charges with elusiveness
[6:41:17] nightbreeze93: even more laughs xdd
[6:41:19] bojackhorseman2004: I agree with that healing is to "spiky" i think your hp bars should move up and down slower.
[6:41:36] zachl_: and how are they gonna do that bojack
[6:41:55] Vods: heavy dots that you cant cleans xdd
[6:42:00] bojackhorseman2004: Well, they tried to the beginning of this expansion. in beta they buffed everyones stamina
[6:42:10] zachl_: was that really the answer
[6:42:12] Hyvest: they did the same in season 2
[6:42:13] bojackhorseman2004: and increased almost flat raid and dungeon dmg done
[6:42:13] zachl_: no
[6:42:16] zachl_: so whats the solution
[6:42:30] Ajatus: that slowed healing but it didnt slow damage intake
[6:42:31] nightbreeze93: that took a lot out of prodigy
[6:42:41] bojackhorseman2004: Well, its not a "this is the solution done deal" answer. Its a matter of balance
[6:42:46] Ajatus: you have to prune defensive profiles and reduce incoming damage
[6:42:52] Ajatus: only way
[6:42:54] bojackhorseman2004: and really hard balance as its not just class design, but encounter design to
[6:42:54] zachl_: @Ajatus bingoooooo
[6:43:02] zachl_: smart chatter ajatus
[6:43:11] Ajatus: Gladge
[6:43:14] RamblingJosh_: tbh they should just give everyone 100% leech baseline, because sometimes you aren't in range of a healer
[6:43:15] nightbreeze93: D:
[6:43:21] zachl_: if theyre gonna keep making us tankier- this trend of healing is all that can be done to challenge healers
[6:43:25] gronglebunch: @RamblingJosh_ BASEG
[6:43:28] zachl_: and there is no balance
[6:43:50] bojackhorseman2004: I dont get the "hp bars are to spiky" to "they should remove defensives" where is the line connecting those?
[6:44:07] Aandromega: Reminder this boss is literally a blob
[6:44:07] discomancer1: but if you prune defensives, what's going to go on your talent trees? The casuals will throw a shit-storm if they're talent nodes don't feel impactful enough
[6:44:07] Nightbot: 🔔 Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yumytv and follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/yumytv 🐦
[6:44:08] nightbreeze93: the reason defensives are so strong is because you don'[t want to get oneshot
[6:44:21] Ajatus: the spiky damage is a reaction to force players to press defensives. if you reduce the defensives you can smooth out the spikes
[6:44:23] nightbreeze93: you need tanky classes to live so if you remove those abilities you can tune down the damage
[6:44:46] zachl_: @bojackhorseman2004 if you remove the amount of defensives we have and dont make everything one shot, ur healer can go back to a non fiendish playstyle
[6:44:59] Emm_Zee: Deadge
[6:45:07] MierkaBlue: I really disliked healing in S2, somewhat in S1 start but now S3 it is still very spiky and stressful and bosses scale out of control real easy - but at least I have been having fun this season despite of it all
[6:45:07] zachl_: however its getting to a point where defensives AND healing or needed
[6:45:18] zachl_: are*
[6:45:20] Axmaster55: Deadge
[6:45:25] adrise__: o7
[6:45:25] nightbreeze93: look at all that agreement Gladge
[6:45:35] albojah: Any1 cleared M Tindral yet with the nerfs?
[6:45:39] nightbreeze93: it's a https://clips.twitch.tv/InterestingSlipperyEggplantDatSheffy-vudt59U5bpxpMjwg moment
[6:45:41] Florathenoob: youre doing great man
[6:45:50] Emm_Zee: It's also such a goddamn pain to assign defensives for every boss mechanic
[6:45:56] zachl_: ^
[6:46:01] RamblingJosh_: the thing I don't like is that, defensives just become a solution to a puzzle, rather than something you use because you need it. But maybe this is just my old man brain
[6:46:37] zachl_: @RamblingJosh_ its both, most mechanics u wont live with just ur dr u need healing
[6:47:09] zachl_: thats the main issue, need to double down on defensives being enough, or defensives being more scarce so that you can tune damage properly for healers
[6:47:28] bojackhorseman2004: I think its really boring design to just have baseline tanky classes and everyone just dpses and waits for healer to heal them. survivability is a shared resposnsibility.  Imo its an ecounter design issue mostly and class design issue secondly. Using defensive for big personal hits and relying on healer for mass aoe or trickle dmg. Or dmg ticks that happen to frequent for defensive CD. Its what they are trying to do just not very well this season.
[6:47:34] xzamolodx: defensives are supposed to make the healers job easier, not essential to living an ability
[6:47:34] bojackhorseman2004: and its mostly becuse of the encounters imo
[6:47:59] nightbreeze93: but it's fine to have some active defensives, it's just that it got a bit out of hand
[6:48:00] bojackhorseman2004: Ruby is a great example of shared responsibility. Plenty of examples where you have to use personal and plenty where you just need a pumper healer.
[6:48:12] Ajatus: defensives should only exist to allow hero plays like 'oh my tank went down let me press blur and hold it together long enough to get a rez and recover' shit that makes you feel good. it should be required to press a button every 20s or else whoops you just got 1 shot bozo
[6:48:23] Ajatus: shouldnt*
[6:48:28] xzamolodx: agree
[6:48:37] hunterzx: @bojackhorseman2004 when its hard to heal, mitigating a ability that does 50% of your hp by 40% can be meaningful. This was the case with sludgefist. Todays balance: it can do 99% of your hp and healers top you in 2s. So you don't need defensive unless its 100%
[6:48:50] zachl_: ur healer should be able to heal every mech if playing properly without dr
[6:48:53] discomancer1: @bojackhorseman2004 well how do they make encounters hard if there's no spiky damage? With our current kits, everyone could infinite live every encounter from BFA, the only challenge would be doing enough damage to beat the timer
[6:48:55] zachl_: the issue is now u need dr and healing
[6:49:38] spacecow5: KEKW
[6:49:39] zachl_: @discomancer1 by removing our defensives and tuning down damage scaling
[6:49:45] zachl_: thats the only answer Shruge
[6:49:57] discomancer1: yea I agree, but I was addressing bojack's sentiment
[6:50:07] RamblingJosh_: yee. How do you ever die if you have 3 DRs and a cheat
[6:50:20] zachl_: or what do u do when u have 3 drs a cheat and still die
[6:50:26] nightbreeze93: i dont think all defensives have to go or be unimportant, it can be a play to recognize that a boss mechanic targets you specifically
[6:50:42] xzamolodx: ^
[6:50:43] nightbreeze93: something that might happen every other minute or so
[6:50:59] nightbreeze93: not machine gun archers in theater of pain
[6:51:08] Tocketimer: HOLY
[6:51:20] albojah: when is raid? wanna see tindy with nerfs
[6:51:53] chixx: Why is he not using rising sun kick on cd
[6:52:10] nightbreeze93: they don't call it spin to win for nothing
[6:52:10] chixx: in Boss fight
[6:52:11] dorki: boss ai should be smarter
[6:52:16] dorki: make it only target players with defensives
[6:52:25] dorki: thatd be sick
[6:52:29] discomancer1: that would be sick
[6:52:37] nightbreeze93: or at least no repeats?
[6:52:40] Emm_Zee: Mages would complain about getting all the mechanics xdd
[6:52:42] roguerhino: that would be super easy to program too
[6:52:42] Ajatus: quick everyone burn your defensives to brick the boss AI
[6:52:59] roguerhino: until its not easy that is haha
[6:53:17] Ajatus: xddPeat
[6:53:23] t4pekid: Joever
[6:53:23] nightbreeze93: it could be smth like no player targeted twice in a row or twice out of three
[6:53:43] RamblingJosh_: that would be so lame, if there's a 100% chance a mechanic can be personalled then there's no reason to manage your personals
[6:53:55] discomancer1: good
[6:53:55] Emm_Zee: I mean it would not matter if you got targeted ten times if you didn't need a dr for every cast
[6:53:55] roguerhino: well that would also make it so hunters have to turtle and stuff too. that would be nice to see
[6:53:55] zachl_: ive said it before but s3/s4 healer/holy tuning was amazing, you werent getting one shot, one global was topping 1 person, and as long as u played correctly no one died
[6:54:02] nightbreeze93: well the player still has to react to the mechanic?
[6:54:23] bojackhorseman2004: @dorki Thats a cook, but the more i think about the more i am like "hmm could work"
[6:54:25] Ajatus: and make it a private aura too
[6:55:10] bojackhorseman2004: Imagine you had a boss who target players with defensives, but you had a mage who "bait" every ability and rotate defensives and externals from heal
[6:55:34] Ajatus: @bojackhorseman2004 no u just burn all ur defensives precombat and brick the ai
[6:55:39] Emm_Zee: Sounds ass for pugging
[6:55:44] steki47: hello guys! anyone know if i can setup vuhdo for mouseover?
[6:55:52] Cardenarcc: Hello Mr Growl
[6:55:59] Ajatus: vuhdo has mouseover by default
[6:56:12] Ajatus: anything you bind through vuhdo will be mouseover
[6:56:40] bojackhorseman2004: should i reroll nightelf healer?
[6:56:42] bojackhorseman2004: xD
[6:56:46] nightbreeze93: yes meld is OP
[6:56:47] bojackhorseman2004: I love these growl tricks
[6:56:49] Emm_Zee: The mindgame of "ok I got one cast of a mechanic where I got no dr, wonder which one my mage is gonna mass barrier" is also shitty
[6:57:01] steki47: @Ajatus yeah but i mean if i dont bind, but has blizzard mouseover cast enabled
[6:57:12] IAttackYou: dang this is over time eh
[6:57:20] Ajatus: should still work
[6:57:37] Ajatus: as long as you dont have it rebound through vuhdo
[6:57:46] Axmaster55: MONKA
[6:57:50] nightbreeze93: it's probably just fundamentally a problem that bad RNG can make some things almost impossible to live
[6:58:04] nightbreeze93: if you want to change it you are gonna end up with a strange cook
[6:58:26] Emm_Zee: You make it so that you don't need a DR for the mechanics
[6:58:47] Emm_Zee: Each cast can be healed by the healer
[6:58:55] nightbreeze93: yeah ok, i prefer to have at least some
[6:59:09] nightbreeze93: it's more interactive
[6:59:16] Emm_Zee: And you can send a defensive if something goes wrong
[6:59:53] Ajatus: yeah but theyre for emergencies defensives shouldnt be required every time something happens just to not be 1 shot
[6:59:55] ryan4: is that ellesmere's shadowmeld WA he's using?
[7:00:00] nightbreeze93: well i agree that a 1 shot without dr is bad
[7:00:16] nightbreeze93: but it might be a difficult-to-heal if yoiu dont press something
[7:00:22] wastedheals: dice roll xdd
[7:01:29] Axmaster55: LMAO
[7:01:40] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd

[9:02:09] xoCakepop: kaipo always the problem tbh
[9:02:21] Aldewin25: @RamblingJosh_ its all good trash on boss
[9:02:25] jonpelf: CatJam
[9:02:25] Nightbot: catJAM
[9:02:30] jonpelf: catJAM
[9:02:31] RamblingJosh_: trueee
[9:02:46] zachl_: dratnos shouldnt fix the tooth
[9:02:51] zachl_: it adds to the lore
[9:03:20] yctnm: max's magnificent mind Gladge
[9:05:00] zachl_: but thats the thing u can literally throw anything on
[9:05:03] zachl_: be nonverbal
[9:05:10] zachl_: non partnered account
[9:06:04] RamblingJosh_: Sounds like a different problem honestly. It's not really energy, it's motivation. I think they are different thinks, depending on the person
[9:06:11] zachl_: but if its a 2nd account who cares
[9:06:19] zachl_: not ur main brand uk
[9:07:28] costcohotdogenjoyer: hello gamers
[9:08:19] baseboned: I'm already gone
[9:08:26] baseboned: I haven't watched growl in years
[9:08:57] scraps_ifound: I miss stellarous
[9:09:06] commandpostkyle: DuckerZ
[9:09:29] RamblingJosh_: I think its more true on other platforms where you're more at mercy of the algorithm, and less choosing people from an explicit following list
[9:09:50] swimmydude: I think part of the issue is when people have options of what streamer they want to watch, they'll watch one that's more recent in their mind or whatever. I defiently do that. I'll go to one that's been on more recently if I have to choose if like my main streamer or two aren't on
[9:09:51] Whitewolf1441: his beard is incredible
[9:10:00] baseboned: Dratnos is secretly super mean
[9:10:01] berchberkins: social battery KEKW
[9:10:04] raxyraxy: wdym character TrollAware
[9:10:59] Linith_Heart: how do i play good
[9:10:59] Whitewolf1441: quality of the question xD
[9:11:32] Aldewin25: do we ever ask good questions tho
[9:11:34] costcohotdogenjoyer: when is season 4 Kappa
[9:11:51] dsiftmagus: after hp nerf for tindral what u think guys lust p2 or p3?
[9:11:51] baseboned: show talents
[9:11:56] raxyraxy: OMEGALUL
[9:11:57] dsiftmagus: does it still phase at same percentage?
[9:12:32] NahrSnow: i'm only here for that damn waffle cat
[9:12:34] backwardhatkid: i feel wow is a great streamer game. focus on raid or dungeon and then the in between is talking to chat. you get both
[9:12:37] relicz: i think its just twitch basically if youre good at a game
[9:12:46] Aldewin25: @NahrSnow facts
[9:12:58] zachl_: the amount of oMe's farmed in pokes chat is insane
[9:13:01] Linith_Heart: if your being asked the same question every day that means you get new viewers every day so its good right?
[9:13:22] RamblingJosh_: weird topic to open on, but it's interesting
[9:13:35] Aldewin25: @Linith_Heart or just one guy with a really bad memory
[9:13:43] Jrooxd: They should talk about the fncs
[9:13:59] Outsane: Do you play the sick uppies build for this fight?
[9:14:07] Linith_Heart: ah yes the alzheimer viewers
[9:14:48] Outsane: it's satisfying to send out 10 atones at once :D
[9:15:35] costcohotdogenjoyer: read a book OMEGALUL
[9:15:39] RamblingJosh_: i think conventional wisdom is that, consistency is way more important than # of hours, but the brain is weird
[9:15:45] Aldewin25: whats a book
[9:17:08] theskot: so that was a lie
[9:17:45] moinsen_040: wideNessie
[9:19:58] relicz: iirc they talk about that
[9:20:12] Morayeden: LETHIMCOOK
[9:20:32] theskot: its min maxing your success odds in the overall tourney
[9:23:15] Morayeden: The implication is Last Hope is just lazy and not trying to win which is def not the case.
[9:27:49] peatear19: @yumytv what do u think about them dropping mdi all together and have tgp every season instead?
[9:27:57] baseboned: i think head to head ios a bad format for wow pve
[9:28:00] hunterzx: If they have head to head, imo it should have a map Pick, not just ban. So one team can put pressure on a better team even if there are maps with dogshit affixes
[9:28:07] talkley: TGP style to final 3 than they do MDI all together BO7 than top 2 do it again
[9:28:21] asd123qwerty1: growl i fucking love u man
[9:28:24] asd123qwerty1: im just here giggling
[9:28:33] costcohotdogenjoyer: they talk about bans in a bit
[9:29:01] talkley: quit banning maps
[9:29:06] shred403: Yo I watched that high card deck run. What a wild deck
[9:29:09] talkley: tell teams to stop being lil losers
[9:29:20] RamblingJosh_: loser picks map, winner picks affixes lol
[9:29:28] talkley: 'oh i dont wanna play atal BabyRage '
[9:29:49] asd123qwerty1: balatro after raid big vibes only?
[9:31:37] salsa_ty: growl do u think female dwarves can find love
[9:32:32] kaipolive: *stands right in the frontal*   "WHAT THE"
[9:33:34] Juicewolff: love this double content
[9:34:30] baseboned: did max just reverse his earlier position??
[9:34:33] Drohgoh: why is there not a yapping emote
[9:34:37] Drohgoh: oh there is
[9:34:52] Tortellini13: YAPPP
[9:35:08] peatear19: maxproc
[9:36:17] Morayeden: SNIFFA Give loot
[9:37:27] Scaparino: i like atal FeelsGoodMan
[9:37:55] Scaparino: i gotta say, snapping made mdi much more enjoyable to watch
[9:38:04] hunterzx: bla yapping
[9:38:08] relicz: i would love to what a tournament where everything is allowed would look like
[9:40:14] Scaparino: right boss in atal dazar dorkiHw
[9:40:21] YuzukiKaze: plink
[9:41:24] Scaparino: everything, that is forbidden, should be on a list accessible to every team and be updated constantly
[9:41:55] Scaparino: and it has been done in every mdi prior
[9:41:59] minglium: why does boss need to shut a door anyway?
[9:42:07] Scaparino: pulling through a wall has been done very often
[9:42:08] KingOfOreo: I don't know if this is better but I wonder if Blizz should announce when they decline something
[9:42:19] bazzu12: roight roight indubitably
[9:42:29] Morayeden: NA spys Madge
[9:42:36] Scaparino: @minglium its mostly to not do stuff with boss mechanics by pulling the boss out of the intended area i think
[9:43:06] shred403: If the admins say no on a situation should they not tell all the other teams ?
[9:43:36] lord_rimheart: that also involved an exploit YEP
[9:43:59] Scaparino: @shred403 yeah exactly, if something is forbidden it should be knowledge to every team
[9:44:03] Nightbot: 🔔 Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yumytv and follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/yumytv 🐦
[9:44:08] Scaparino: *known
[9:44:35] lord_rimheart: exploit early, exploit often YEPPERS
[9:45:38] Scaparino: if blizzard wants to do it right they need to have systems or ppl in place to monitor the teams practice, but that ofc would cost a lot of ressources
[9:45:38] Tortellini13: the only casual people who care are prob mad their fav team didn't do the strat
[9:46:00] relicz: people love watching speedruns with glitches and shit so it might be the same here
[9:46:20] lord_rimheart: if you found that plagueborer stuff, would you even ask an admin about it or would you just ignore it because you assume it's not allowed?
[9:46:28] YuzukiKaze: bla rar
[9:46:33] Morayeden: maxProc
[9:47:19] Scaparino: dratnos knows every boss yumytvPog
[9:47:29] ortemismw: 31 raiders from ortemismw have joined! 
[9:47:41] pl0de: maxProc yapping
[9:48:02] ortemismw: im jelly
[9:48:04] ortemismw: never hit 1100
[9:48:07] ortemismw: we got like 1070 i think
[9:49:00] lord_rimheart: yeah, that stuff is on blizzard
[9:49:05] hunterzx: either way the opportunity is so op.. you just do it. worst case you lose/forfeit a map
[9:49:10] ortemismw: that sounds super fun
[9:49:22] ortemismw: yeah i'm not great at car metas and stuff
[9:49:31] ortemismw: i also just don't play that much usualyl just when i'm over at my parents
[9:49:40] Scaparino: wasnt there a strat where they mind controled the plagueborer and let it explode with druid tornado thingy? they fixed that immediatly
[9:49:49] ortemismw: no move is super fun
[9:51:40] Scaparino: spiteful affix activated
[9:51:57] hunterzx: skill issue. If liquid were good enough, they could kill the boss before blizzard hotfixed it too KEKVibe
[9:52:23] Mjawwww: abuse early and often
[9:52:32] Jrooxd: someone just vantusd
[9:53:25] Kakodulos: how can u make a pull through a wall and not ask about it though?
[9:53:47] Rinnag: @hunterzx its not even about skill, it's about echo raiding when the devs are sleeping, which means they have a lot more time to abuse a bug that is going to get fixed
[9:54:47] RamblingJosh_: everyone thinks it's obvious what an exploit is, and yet their list is a little different from every other list
[9:55:40] Kakodulos: thats weird, wasnt it allowed to pull mobs in the night fae dungeon? the 1 with the maze
[10:00:51] swftrrr: how goes the smolderon re prog Kapp
