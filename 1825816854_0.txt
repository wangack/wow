[0:21:09] Norbuc: What addont it`s that combo point ?
[0:21:12] Sipher_VM: With Entangling roots kiting, and the reduced chance roots breaks from damage +healing makes it very hard to kill

[0:23:35] Cowardpatty: Nothing
[0:23:40] Cowardpatty: Overwhelming?
[0:23:44] stokes_t: theres too much going on in retail for me
[0:23:47] stokes_t: they need to start fresh
[0:23:49] KaotiK_X: Maybe the 4 hours of wiping
[0:23:52] coolcoolcool777dood: there's no progression to it, no reward feelings... its just a bland grind
[0:24:02] restrodruid121: Swift how much should one spend on a computer to be able to play classic or wrath?
[0:24:03] agent_joel009: Tauren got the best starting zone üòÅ
[0:24:10] whorgasms: you have any max levels in classic?
[0:25:14] Sipher_VM: I quit retail about 2-3 months in the dragonflight. The thing is the game never really changes, it's becoming redundant.
[0:25:24] okEllen: Thats so sad...
[0:25:37] mammutwatch: A Manabar - but no use for it . 100 levelzones - but only highend content . " Fear of missing out " - removed items . Not many class differences. gear doesnt feel rewarding ^^
[0:25:53] Capull0Spawn: you talking about RBG Boosting? Its stupid on EU Server. Played always High RBG... two Wins.. and you gonna face a Booster Team
[0:26:10] TheKevinLanders: @Swifty why people in rbgs so toxic?
[0:26:25] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:26:40] Capull0Spawn: i love RBG yeah
[0:27:00] Capull0Spawn: yeah me too
[0:27:09] WarheadSmash: I actually played in one RBG with you.....I had a great time
[0:27:11] Markfooz: its not just rbg toxic all wow pvp is toxic, highly competitive = toxic
[0:27:18] Markfooz: at high level
[0:27:33] thelegendfam: as a returning player i dont like the whole craft order system
[0:27:39] Sipher_VM: I miss old RBG's
[0:27:40] Capull0Spawn: RBG is mire Tactic - Soloque trying to Oneshot - Arena CDs Trading. i Love the tactic aspekt behind rbg
[0:28:00] RobTheWayfarer: Swifty, PVP or PVE?
[0:28:10] bird_face: Hey Swifty, what monitor are you using? Looks massive
[0:28:14] honey_bunnzz: lol
[0:28:22] JattixTV: Thats why I cannot bring myself to try rbgs anymore. I don't mind losing but to lose to teams that a re doding each other and queuing only into others sucks and makes the game feel very non natural to me
[0:28:25] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:28:30] Galdrena: !monitor
[0:28:30] StreamElements: Swifty's new monitor is a LG ULtraGear OLED WQHD (3440 x 1440) 21:9 curved gaming monitor. 240Hz Refresh Rate. 0.03ms Response Time.

[0:28:49] cones001: swifty do you have a macro for the 2  cds?
[0:28:53] niburu__: You should download questie
[0:29:11] Galdrena: he has questie
[0:29:13] Cowardpatty: Just died to a rare gnoll in Mulgore.   So much for that lol
[0:29:14] Toqinzz: do you have an alt shaman on stormrage? a shaman called something shamanswifty or something?
[0:29:24] AddemaN: DING
[0:29:37] zeeenos: wheres the minimap
[0:29:41] WarheadSmash: I think it's a bigger problem than just high-rated RBGs. Granted, you have those whose entire egos center around being successful in PvP, but that's another story.
[0:29:42] niburu__: then it should show where all the quest items are on the map
[0:29:45] Toqinzz: thought so
[0:29:54] Martylang: yeaa druid lets goooo
[0:30:22] mvphunter: Swifty is that your only HC char ?

[3:00:55] xanchoviox: It just sounds cowardly
[3:00:58] morilyn: have they decided there gonna make a hardcore server ??
[3:00:59] wowpally2136: ik
[3:01:06] Markfooz: its funny that u thinkj u can just sit in stealth as a druid and no one will every pull u out and /afk will save u
[3:01:15] jxakari: can you even do bgs in HC? i thought it was a rule that you can not participate except only in world pvp

[3:02:51] Cowardpatty: It's improbable to the point of being impossible
[3:02:53] Cnith: won't you constantly run out of opponents
[3:03:00] Xaviwan078: classic hardcore pvp is only for real wooorriiooorr to the death for glory
[3:03:07] NBK_Sethus: wait... is this a new char?
[3:03:08] xichell: swifty dont worry about getting to 60 now when servers come out just buy the lvl 60 HC token
[3:03:18] Xaviwan078: victory or death
[3:03:22] Antimache: @Swifty Make a rogue and it would be very possible to tank
[3:03:24] Antimache: rank*
[3:03:39] SpamLive: no bg allowed in hc tho =/
[3:03:42] Cowardpatty: But, it will be great content!  :D
[3:03:50] tesirindie: I think release next month
[3:03:57] WOOPsWOOP: think how hard it is to level and then mulptiply that by many many times, there are very very skilled players in classic who have played constantly since it came out
[3:03:58] GRVPHX: thats a good idea
[3:04:07] Antimache: No way as a streamer @Swifty you would be sniped within 3minutes.

[3:07:12] grimfan22: how can you die 1-60 ?
[3:07:21] grimfan22: even if the mobs are not tuned for hc
[3:07:55] tesirindie: I think, Hardcore isn‚Äôt really a Hardcore. Because if you die you die, game over. But in normal mode, if you die, you release and you continue to survive and play and this is more hard I think because in Hardcore you skip hard quests etc and if you die you die like I said, game over. Hard mode is over, and I think I am right.
[3:08:02] ask_peter: @Swifty it was just two times the word "lesser"

[5:22:55] baylo: swifty how does it feel to be the lebron james of world of warcraft, #goat
[5:23:20] driski: we are not prepared..
[5:23:29] Cilagon33: You need to know the people you do the dungeon with know how to play ^^
[5:23:50] funnyc4t: Whats the point of the rule only allowed to do dungeons once? That seems a little meh :D
[5:23:52] KodiakJedi: @gotcha2157 Take a deep breath...like breath in one deep breath until you can't breath in any more...then try and breathe one more tiny bit in and hold it for as long as you can
[5:23:55] War_Mode_RedLeader: did they kill multi-boxing?
[5:24:02] ThickFit: I like mage, I hate having to drink every pull.
[5:24:03] Harnell: yo swofty
[5:24:07] Cilagon33: Play hunter, it‚Äôs like you get a second life with feign death
[5:24:11] KodiakJedi: @gotcha2157 it stretches the muscle out that spasms and causes hiccups
[5:24:15] dreadprince: @swifty ask mitch
[5:24:17] Xaviwan078: i want a voice for quest in retail to

[5:24:41] Harnell: what r u eating swofty?
[5:24:47] QBdoobeDo: Tauren Warlock
[5:24:49] obsidial418: aoe is hard with overpopulated server
[5:24:52] tron3kk: pally is biz Kreygasm
[5:24:52] gotcha2157: yeah i tried the holding breath thing...these are stubborn @KodiakJedi  FeelsBadMan
[5:24:54] paperdogs: 1st place is mage, 2nd hunter
[5:24:54] Glyrion: last time i saw swifty he was in the closet...he got an upgrade :D
[5:24:59] Cilagon33: Mage is the fastest, but it‚Äôs super risky. I‚Äôd say warlock or hunter
[5:25:00] xiig0atediix: Why no warrior?
[5:25:09] loudpack199: if u wanna die
[5:25:10] nashonatorrr: i wouldn't aoe, but frost is really safe
[5:25:24] Bobbywalt: certain dungeons yes, but not fully
[5:25:29] Harnell: you can solo some
[5:25:34] Harnell: like ZF grinding
[5:25:34] ALjalladTv: u solo stratholme and die like mitch did :)
[5:25:34] dustycrusty97: zf GY

[5:25:37] sv1nas: Maurdon You can
[5:25:41] Harnell: but you wouldbt be able to finish the whole thing
[5:25:50] funnyc4t: You can still only do the dungeon one time right?
[5:25:54] Hot_Sauce_Ross: There would be a video of it by now if someone did it
[5:26:09] obsidial418: depends I think
[5:26:13] Harnell: 5 days possibly
[5:26:15] Harnell: or less
[5:26:19] Cilagon33: You can utilize the step pathing in SM cath
[5:26:20] Harnell: if ur tryhard pro
[5:26:22] Hot_Sauce_Ross: correct @funnyc4t
[5:26:24] Djinx_o: AoE farming is high risk high reward

[5:26:58] nashonatorrr: 10
[5:27:02] Hot_Sauce_Ross: Frost nova at lvl 8
[5:27:04] Deathleta: Mages have ports and you can make your own water etc. Which is why I am going to play one in HC, I played one in classic and loved it. but they are glass cannons just fyi LUL
[5:27:20] Cosmic_KO: 20
[5:27:21] Djinx_o: blizzard is 22 i think
[5:27:27] Cosmic_KO: for blizzard
[5:27:28] Hot_Sauce_Ross: blizzard at 20
[5:27:29] Djinx_o: and where aoe farming begins
[5:27:37] Healraizzor: Nova with 10
[5:27:46] nashonatorrr: you need engineering to
[5:27:48] Bobbywalt: max
[5:27:51] Lzhealz: what is the average death on hardcore classic ?
[5:28:04] Fugazi811: need handful of frost talents to aoe farm
[5:28:04] Djinx_o: level 14 ish
[5:28:13] Cilagon33: No but you can‚Äôt really do it well before 22 because you need improved blizzard 2/3

[5:29:26] funnyc4t: They nerfed so mage's can't boost anymore right? I just dont remember how.
[5:29:29] blastnovaarea52: And you can teleport and stuff
[5:29:34] Cilagon33: There are no restriction in dungeons. Mage is really strong
[5:29:47] Bobbywalt: mages are the developer favs
[5:29:54] Cosmic_KO: Mage has a lot of good abilities but also one of the lowest health pools of any class so it gets melted quick.
[5:30:02] Cilagon33: But difficult to master, can get punished hard
[5:30:12] ALjalladTv: they made mobs not slowable after like 15sec @funnyc4t

[5:43:55] loudpack199: u can shot wand at any lvl and buy one from vender at 15
[5:43:56] ThickFit: Just hard to get one soon
[5:44:03] Krelivane_: Did the druid die?
[5:44:05] Chrimz_: yeah its the same
[5:44:07] Kinjospyke: either obtained or made from enchanting, bus yes mage gets to use a wand
[5:44:11] loudpack199: u will proably get a wand before 15
[5:44:51] ZugZugArt: you can learn Tailoring/Enchanting, get 80 line cloth, craft green - dis it and craft want, delete enchanting and take skinning :)
[5:45:09] Pr1m0x21: tailoring
[5:45:09] Kileer94: tailo
[5:45:12] Kinjospyke: enchanting tailoring is good
[5:45:15] loudpack199: tailoring is good
[5:45:16] dazbonesdaz: That's a good idea @zugzugart
[5:45:18] Kinjospyke: or go skinning tailoring first
[5:45:20] Arenyxx: i did tailor and ench for wand first
[5:45:25] Kinjospyke: then drop skinning for enchanting
[5:45:29] Sinjin77: Hardcore mode for Swifty would be leveling a character without using macros!!
[5:45:30] Cilagon33: Engineering if you‚Äôre going pvp
[5:45:42] Plandemics: this ui feels like og 2004
[5:45:44] loudpack199: u can buy vender wand at lvl 15
[5:45:46] SeanChristohper: ??
[5:45:51] faramir4: thats the play
[5:46:03] Kinjospyke: Youll want skins from skinning for tailoring patterns, otherwise you can grab skins from fishing
[5:46:10] AllenzoTV: yeah
[5:46:11] loudpack199: YES
[5:46:18] tron3kk: smart guy SeemsGood

[5:47:34] driski: you wont get to 60 tho LUL
[5:47:44] bistraya_seledka: If you want skinning for money, then tailoring + enchanting is better for low levels, because of vendoring Minor Mana Oil (5s) and Lesser Magic Wand (5s).
[5:47:45] driski: Too risky
[5:47:57] Chrimz_: lol
[5:48:03] andreas4511: High risk but high reward

[5:49:58] Tjewie: is it just me or is the capture of the gameplay weird?
[5:50:07] dazbonesdaz: That voice acting add-on is cool
[5:50:21] Frank4LuLz: si
[5:50:35] Pallyofhell: pretty sure it was
[5:50:50] ZugZugArt: Easy AOE farm in the open world for sure, many streamers do that in HC
[5:50:57] Cilagon33: Alliance for sure
[5:51:03] Frank4LuLz: ally
[5:51:08] dazbonesdaz: Probably alliance but I'm not sure
[5:51:14] mirkocrates: Ally
[5:51:15] TrioDeFo: Alliance 100%
[5:51:17] WowGrl: The cactus apple stuff gives you a  15 min buff
[5:51:18] Cilagon33: In AV alliance has a huge advantage because of the bridge
[5:51:23] therapy4pain: AV=Ally
[5:51:31] Frank4LuLz: we zerg
[5:51:47] NuclearFrisson: AV stands for alliance victory
[5:52:02] Cilagon33: Any other bg = horde
[5:52:11] driski: LUL
[5:52:11] Cilagon33: AV = alliance
[5:52:14] Frank4LuLz: yup, two towers and zerge
[5:52:28] Chrimz_: During Drek or Kek stuff in classic I got so many alliance wins lol
[5:52:29] driski: yea av favors alliance
[5:52:31] dazbonesdaz: That I would probably agree with
[5:52:35] Frank4LuLz: no back capping
[5:52:39] Bowline21: your druid die again?
[5:52:39] TrioDeFo: I always thought Alliance had to big advantage for their setup and having the bridge
[5:52:41] dazbonesdaz: But I'm no expert
[5:52:45] NuclearFrisson: I don't remember ever winning in vanilla, AV just went on for hours and you tapped out when you'd had enough
[5:52:49] Drascho27: yeah all alliance had to do is jump over the gates of the horde base and rush the boss
[5:52:52] Chrimz_: av favors ally
[5:52:55] mirkocrates: Horde Win alot of wsg but it's more balanced
[5:52:55] therapy4pain: Big bg = Alli   Small bg=Horde is what I experience
[5:53:06] JattixTV: JattixTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Swifty you can it, get to 60 HC! Love ya bro!

[5:53:57] Kileer94: what is people stop res
[5:54:01] Kileer94: if
[5:54:01] tron3kk: yup horde SMOrc
[5:54:03] dazbonesdaz: Don't blame em
[5:54:06] TrioDeFo: I remember AV battles going for hours and hours in vanilla
[5:54:17] dazbonesdaz: For the horde!
[5:54:27] Chrimz_: I honestly do think AV has far more ally wins than Horde once they add the clock. During classic Horde just put ally into turtles a lot
[5:54:37] agent_joel009: it is what it is
[5:54:45] Deatth1: @Swifty You ever play Runescape?
[5:55:07] Kileer94: but isint faster to farm solo rank 14
[5:55:24] KokaKhorla: anyone got a clip of his druid death

[5:55:53] michfufufu: When AV launched I was horde on Kelthuzad.  AV games would last for like 36 hours.  Login the next day, same game going.
[5:55:59] BloodDrunk87: Horde
[5:56:05] Bowline21: you played shaman in classic i think

[6:22:19] AC1DNUK3: SwiftyShaman?
[6:22:45] MyOpiate: 60 this time?
[6:22:52] Drascho27: mage is only the fastest level if you're doing aoe leveling
[6:22:54] blastnovaarea52: You can Iceblock in PvP and then AFK if you need also so can farm honor
[6:22:59] Cilagon33: Mage only level up the fastest if you can master aoe pulls

[6:25:38] PeelsNFeels: Sadly, buying water as a mage is a must later in the game.. just too little mana given from the conjured.
[6:25:48] blastnovaarea52: Frostbolt is better
[6:25:51] back2r00ts: yes more safe

[8:20:49] ragnar2088: I just saw a warrior with highwarlord and thunderfury...he has 469 days played...JEEZ
[8:21:12] ragnar2088: not you a random
[8:21:28] AussieDave1980: 6@Swifty would that not be considered an exploit and against TOS in the sense of a completely political correct TOS
[8:21:37] ragnar2088: that amount of days played is just insane
[8:22:51] eldavide1234: maybe it was inflatable :D ?
[8:23:10] DeadBananaTV: Just found [Diamond Hammer] in HC! Wohoo
[8:23:15] DeadBananaTV: On a warrior also
[8:23:16] severe3x: lol wut
[8:23:16] AussieDave1980: the ice block and the /afk
[8:23:23] DeadBananaTV: Very cool
[8:23:23] Rodolfosvr: What map do you recommend for ***lo warrior lvl up 35-40
[8:23:25] account4turbonoadz: i think they mean bubble hearth and stuff like that is against hardcore tos
[8:23:27] account4turbonoadz: idk though
[8:23:28] severe3x: ice block afk is not against tos lol
[8:23:30] quenzar: I don‚Äôt care if Wether‚Äôs Originals are the official candy of old people, they‚Äôre delicious
[8:23:34] AussieDave1980: yes
[8:23:39] amazonianshroomsniffer: Swifty how I‚Äôll you get honor If BG‚Äôs don‚Äôt work? World pvpvpvp?
[8:23:39] account4turbonoadz: i know you arent allowed to bubble hearth
[8:23:40] Cylexan: 4 raiders from Cylexan have joined! 
[8:23:40] AussieDave1980: exactly what you said
[8:23:46] Markfooz: absolutely it would be
[8:23:51] Markfooz: its a very lame move tbh
[8:23:58] quenzar: Technically no
[8:23:59] severe3x: afking on purpose without leaving a bg is against competitive spirit
[8:24:12] Markfooz: but then dont play bgs....
[8:24:13] AussieDave1980: its a gray area, lol
[8:24:18] account4turbonoadz: they have a whole different ruleset for hardcore, theres specific stuff that is an instant disqualify
[8:24:39] UrsineTV: can druids fly in their travvel form in the dragon isleS?
[8:24:40] quenzar: But that might not apply on official sevrrs
[8:24:43] quenzar: Srvers
[8:24:46] quenzar: Servers
[8:25:05] account4turbonoadz: the official severs will be awesome to avoid all this type of confusion lol
[8:25:13] Aristant: hey
[8:25:19] quenzar: ^
[8:25:35] account4turbonoadz: PogChamp
[8:25:35] xttjordan: when will they be released
[8:25:42] AussieDave1980: it's like what happened in the RTW. The Shaman resurrection when the Priest Angel was still alive and they got the last 1% of the boss, legal exploit
[8:25:42] smashinu187: AH and grouping right?
[8:25:43] Zeontec: @Swifty  Slight change of subject, but what did you think of Picard season 3? FeelsOkayMan
[8:25:43] komunalec: @Swifty as a hardcore failsave, what do you thing about, when you crate a HC character you have some debuf saying that you play HC and if you die you lose the debuf so you can still continue to play the character but you wont he HC anymore
[8:25:45] Drascho27: @account4turbonoadz Just go read the rules on the website. Not that confusing.
[8:25:55] xttjordan: when will HC server be released
[8:25:56] quenzar: I think the official servers will be just 1 life is the only rule tbh
[8:26:01] agent_joel009: seeing swifty play a mage is very interesting
[8:26:13] account4turbonoadz: @Drascho27 i wasnt asking questions
[8:26:15] Drascho27: lol asking for help is against the rules
[8:26:17] JuggaBugga: so not rlly hardcore at that point lol
[8:26:21] amazonianshroomsniffer: Boosting, auction house, mailbox will not be available. Sorry to burst bubble
[8:26:21] quenzar: They said they want it to be as social as possible
[8:26:26] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:26:28] Rodolfosvr: Hey @swifty any recommendations for a solo warrior (horde) to level up 35-40?
[8:26:35] quenzar: Current HC rules encourage more solo olay
[8:26:38] quenzar: Play
[8:26:48] Drascho27: yeah asking for help is against hc
[8:26:56] Zeontec: @Swifty  Did you watch of Picard season 3? FeelsOkayMan
[8:27:00] quenzar: So they will probably just make it so it‚Äôs regular classic, just death = delete
[8:27:17] Zeontec: SeemsGood
[8:27:22] dvmn__: are u gonna be frost mage or fire?
[8:27:38] quenzar: Yea, they will make it more social
[8:27:38] Ascendor81: you have to play frost for HC
[8:27:41] thesleeped: play your freakin roooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogue
[8:27:42] Ascendor81: surviability
[8:28:04] Drascho27: yeah the addon will probably still be more popular imo
[8:28:08] quenzar: Lol
[8:28:10] ThickFit: I'd buy it lmao
[8:28:10] Zeontec: yyjSmile yyjYikes yyjCreep yyjWeird
[8:28:20] quenzar: Boasphemy
[8:28:24] komunalec: imagine the twig on the HC pvp servers
[8:28:26] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:28:27] ThickFit: @Drascho27 It won't
[8:28:32] quenzar: No
[8:28:42] vetsttv: YEP HAHAHA I WOULD FOR SURE
[8:28:51] Ascendor81: you lose it if you die
[8:28:52] sixotwoqt: Hardcore addon will die.  Its barely hanging on by a thread as it is
[8:28:54] Markfooz: honestly tho i think i9f theres a market for it i dont mind
[8:28:57] quenzar: To do that people would have to level to 60 tho
[8:28:57] account4turbonoadz: according to the rules no trading is allowed so if its anything like osrs they will complete disable the ability to trade
[8:28:58] severe3x: a "starter kit"
[8:29:00] Markfooz: whether i would or not
[8:29:07] vetsttv: still only 19,.99
[8:29:08] xiig0atediix: I'd buy a damn corn dog with crusader on it
[8:29:17] vetsttv: sent the gold to an alt lol
[8:29:20] quenzar: Good sellers won‚Äôt put in the effort to level to 60 to be able to offer all those goods
[8:29:21] komunalec: @vetsttv you like to live in world full of caos i see XD
[8:29:26] severe3x: no one would ever carry gold on them
[8:29:27] shanus53: if you dont want to play HC rules why not just go play on a normal server
[8:29:36] Markfooz: rogue with double skinning knife with fiery weapon
[8:29:37] ThickFit: Level 1 with enchanted dagger and Ony buff.
[8:29:39] Zeontec: Did you turn off the emojis that bounce up and down on screen? yyjSadge
[8:29:39] account4turbonoadz: lol
[8:30:01] Markfooz: because they want the challenge and prestige of being 60 on hc server
[8:30:05] xiig0atediix: HC is a cool theory
[8:30:07] Markfooz: peopl will pay for that
[8:30:07] xiig0atediix: But
[8:30:09] ThickFit: @shanus53 Once the server comes out, Blizzard will be the one's who get to define what HC rules are.
[8:30:14] xiig0atediix: Why not just make the game harder in general

[8:30:26] quenzar: But isn‚Äôt the challenge greatly diminished by having access to all that stuff?
[8:30:37] vanillasky7788: What challange u havent passed 30 dude
[8:30:45] shanus53: its to easy to get twicked and levelled
[8:30:48] sixotwoqt: Its too hard for someone just having fun.  it requires sweaty patient approach
[8:30:52] account4turbonoadz: hc classic with trading and auction house would be a classic reset server where dying is harshly punished
[8:30:57] account4turbonoadz: could be fun
[8:30:57] Sinjin77: Swifty wants the Softcore Challenge
[8:31:01] quenzar: True
[8:31:04] sammiiesosa: swiftyUp swiftyUp swiftyUp swiftyUp
[8:31:09] Stickybladez: I killed Swifty once in 2v2 arena and wear that as my proudest WOW moment
[8:31:26] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[8:31:34] vanillasky7788: Yea swifty wants Softcore challenge
[8:31:39] sanctus83: But youre going to be able to do all elite quests, grind dungeons with a group. The leveliing will be quicker
[8:31:41] quenzar: !points
[8:31:41] StreamElements: @quenzar, quenzar has 82 points and is rank 184905/245473 on the leaderboard.
[8:31:52] komunalec: i would preferer true HC: No mailbox  No group invite  No Trade  No Auction  If you die you are not allowed to paly the same class for some perdiod of time
[8:31:54] shanus53: they will never go to the Barrens just dungeon spam
[8:32:11] sixotwoqt: Its true that if you can trade/group  it will be easy hardcore as you can pay for escorts etc.  OP items and consumables
[8:32:12] sanctus83: he wants softcore with 1 life
[8:32:13] Hot_Sauce_Ross: So get your achievement now while it still means something
[8:32:23] noxxysucks: Let's say you make it to 60, how long would that take in hardcore, a month ? @Swifty
[8:32:32] quenzar: I would prefer the current HC rule set, but I also understand they want to make it more social, which current HC does not facilitate
[8:32:44] quenzar: So there will be some give and take I think
[8:32:47] Hot_Sauce_Ross: exactly @sanctus83
[8:32:57] mysticnikkay: what if the rules are the same ?
[8:33:01] sixotwoqt: Yeah. current HC is way to boring
[8:33:04] pokerchoo: they can just make the addon work for the new servers, what's the difference
[8:34:11] sanctus83: I hope the devs realise this and lock dungeons after 1 run.
[8:34:40] sanctus83: @pokerchoo thats very true also.
[8:34:49] quenzar: Maybe it would be better to make those types of baked quest mobs free for all so there‚Äôs no competing for tags
[8:34:54] komunalec: but they is only for low lvl, it wont happened on the high lvl
[8:34:56] severe3x: AOE farm baby
[8:34:58] quenzar: Just damage it and you get credit or can loot the item
[8:35:12] severe3x: AOE grind as a mage
[8:35:15] sixotwoqt: if you hit 60 in HC can you die after that?
[8:35:18] Hot_Sauce_Ross: having to wait is part of what makes it HARDCORE
[8:35:27] quenzar: Im saying they should make it that way
[8:35:31] gorillapanic23: people could troll partys also
[8:35:35] komunalec: @sixotwoqt if you die = delete
[8:35:39] ThickFit: Ew, no it's not.
[8:35:51] caffeinerushhh: nah servers are packed now and waiting is horrible for quest monsters
[8:35:52] XepppX: no that's time waste for no reason idd
[8:36:06] quenzar: I disagree, The challenge should come from your skill in surviving, not your patience in hanging around for a half hour while trolls steal your tag
[8:36:11] Markfooz: the second people get 60 mages there gonna do stockade boosts, maradon boosts and then ZG boosts for gold get u from 10-60 a good booster wont die at all
[8:36:20] sixotwoqt: People can still grief groups?
[8:36:21] Goonzz999: bag
[8:36:25] Mecabeast: i think retails tagging system would be a good change
[8:36:26] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:36:42] pokerchoo: they could make it similar to retail where everyone who touches it gets credit, that'd be great - named or "special" mobs only
[8:36:47] komunalec: I think it should be somewhere in the middle
[8:37:28] Cookd_: people that want that playstyle will just keep using the addon and playing with eachother
[8:37:38] komunalec: in the middle of current HC rulles and stay in group and do quests together
[8:37:49] Hot_Sauce_Ross: they can allow groups if  you're automatically flagged for PvP while grouped
[8:38:10] Hot_Sauce_Ross: yup
[8:38:17] Hot_Sauce_Ross: tradeoffs
[8:38:26] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:38:33] Hot_Sauce_Ross: that would limit the time people want to spend in groups
[8:38:45] HuntingOblivion: What if they increased the number of tags available so people wouldnt have to group but multiple people could get credit?
[8:38:50] komunalec: how about if you tag it you still get the loot but you dont get the xp XD?
[8:38:55] Drascho27: Love the stream Swifty.
[8:39:20] Lybrid: What's up swifty, haven't watched you in years bro.
[8:39:33] quenzar: They need to just make quest mobs free for all
[8:39:33] komunalec: it would prevent the trolling also will still be HC element on it
[8:39:36] quenzar: Problem socled
[8:39:39] quenzar: Solved
[8:39:44] sammiiesosa: swifty is like the michael jordan of wow
[8:39:53] olshmerky: noice
[8:40:10] Juicewisdom: axeumGasm
[8:40:31] Aldever13: yes we both lived
[8:40:33] avenomxx: did the druid die?
[8:41:06] TwistinFool: when are you aoe farming
[8:41:11] komunalec: or if you group up the mobs will became harder to kill like more HP or more dmg
[8:41:23] severe3x: makes quests way too easy if you can just group up whenever though.
[8:41:24] tcasex: how does world pvp work and pvp in regards to HC?
[8:41:28] sanctus83: What do you think about locking a dungeon after 1 run?
[8:41:31] lenestusss: Mage looks fun and easy @swifty
[8:41:36] Pr1m0x21: u can start at 21 if u have balls
[8:41:49] Drascho27: lol
[8:41:55] driski: esfandLUL
[8:41:57] Hot_Sauce_Ross: stop with the hardcore!
[8:42:01] komunalec: that wont be fun XD hahaha
[8:42:04] quenzar: I agree with one dungeon run per instance
[8:42:05] ThickFit: Yeah, I'd rather be able to keep doing the dungeons, but maybe less EXP after the first time.
[8:42:08] Hot_Sauce_Ross: softcore with one life!
[8:42:09] Drascho27: ^
[8:42:15] avenomxx: this is a republican stream, no restrictions, just kidding
[8:42:30] PD_Smitty: but swifty, youre then just asking for classic wow..
[8:42:37] Aylean: How many HC have you lost now Swifty?
[8:42:39] Sinjin77: No restrictions = not hardcore
[8:42:59] Deathmann76: I agree if people want to party then they can if they don't want to party turn off accepting grups
[8:43:05] quenzar: HC servers will probably have their own death toasts
[8:43:09] Hot_Sauce_Ross: if you want no restrictions but one life you don't need a hardcore server, just play classic and if you die, delete your character.
[8:43:11] ThickFit: Hardcore has almost just mostly meant, one life. Why people have understand this I have no idea lol
[8:43:15] quenzar: So you won‚Äôt need add on to see when someone dies
[8:43:19] avenomxx: you people have to realize, that the average pleb will still die with auction house
[8:43:19] sanctus83: You playing a warrior for full release?
[8:43:35] komunalec: its the same as having some achievement for reaching 60 with out dying if there is no restrictions
[8:43:37] tcasex: traditionally hardcore is just the death aspect. Look at diablo, etc. I agree with Swifty
[8:43:37] Xaviwan078: rank 14 in hadcore classic pvp??
[8:43:50] Deathmann76: I sent there a box in setting to switch to egnor party invites
[8:43:52] quenzar: I mean HC servers will likely have their own death notifications
[8:44:00] quenzar: So add on wouldn‚Äôt be nevessary
[8:44:11] PapasusTTV: nah
[8:44:13] komunalec: but with on restrictions is not that hard XD
[8:44:16] PapasusTTV: no boosting
[8:44:19] Mecabeast: i think warriors get an additional achievement with the hardcore addon
[8:44:25] Sinjin77: It's like saying I want to run an Ironman Triathlon but I want to wear flippers for the swim, an electric bike for the bike section and rollerskates for the marathon
[8:44:29] Hot_Sauce_Ross: the whole entire point is the difficulty
[8:44:31] driski: swifty is corrupted
[8:44:35] Aylean: How many HC characters have you lost so far Swifty?
[8:44:44] ThickFit: No, I want it to be fun. The restriction do not add to the pucker factor.
[8:44:46] PD_Smitty: thats the point of the challenge
[8:44:46] komunalec: just get some 60 to run you thru dungeons
[8:44:50] PD_Smitty: if not then its just classic
[8:44:54] quenzar: Lol Sinjin
[8:44:57] OssewTV: nah i wanna play wow like an mmo
[8:45:03] Deathmann76: I think there should be choice hard core or one life
[8:45:08] sxlyons: People are going to use hardcore as an opportunity to charge for Carries
[8:45:27] Hot_Sauce_Ross: some people just want the diploma but don't want to go to class and do the work and take the exams, some people just want a hardcore achievement but don't want to earn it
[8:45:28] quenzar: There probably won‚Äôt be enough players at 60 to get rank 14
[8:45:28] shanus53: like running a marathon but using a motorbike
[8:45:32] sanctus83: WHat happens if you die at 60?
[8:45:39] quenzar: Would take years
[8:45:42] Deathmann76: Hard core everything solo. One life everything is usable
[8:45:43] thesleeped: !addons
[8:45:43] StreamElements: Swifty uses the following addons on Dragonflight: Coming Soon!  For hardcore addons type !hardcore

[8:46:58] agent_joel009: yo
[8:46:58] Mecabeast: its the quests for harpy area i believe
[8:47:04] Sinjin77: Swifty I'm all for you being able to play how you want to play to get to the end goal you want, i just think you're taking the hardcore out of the hardcore challenge
[8:47:17] Aldever13: @Swifty, did you delete your level 30 warrior?
[8:47:34] komunalec: you should check assention wow ironam + nightmere chanlange
[8:47:35] maffer777: Did you cap rated honor for the week?
[8:47:58] Hot_Sauce_Ross: what doesn't make sense to you
[8:48:01] ThickFit: Their perspective is that standing around waiting on mobs is "harder". When it's not. It's just a waste of time.
[8:48:07] Hot_Sauce_Ross: all the rules are there for a reason
[8:48:13] Iggzey: Who makes the rules for hardcore
[8:48:16] Mecabeast: grouping and trading/ah i think is to eliminate bot activity
[8:48:17] quenzar: What rule doesn‚Äôt make sense?
[8:48:25] Goonzz999: left
[8:48:26] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:48:43] Goonzz999: him
[8:48:52] komunalec: maybe you wont need to use the addon at all but just implement the restriction in the game
[8:48:54] vanillasky7788: HARDCORE CHALLENGE DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE at alll
[8:48:56] Sinjin77: Yah the rules suck and it makes it unbearable but so is running a marathon
[8:49:20] quenzar: That would happen HC or not though
[8:49:26] Aldever13: the grouping up rule should be you can't group up with players 5 levels over you or something. that would make sense
[8:49:30] quenzar: That‚Äôs nothing to do with HC
[8:49:31] shanus53: They can just allow multitag on those quests
[8:49:49] quenzar: ^
[8:49:51] Deathmann76: I think the words hard core means to mutch to different people hard core is supost to be hard hence name I think what people mainly want is one life to do what ever but everyone has there own thoughts about both titles
[8:49:54] Hot_Sauce_Ross: Is Den Mother necessary to complete the game?
[8:50:00] Goonzz999: comon
[8:50:01] shanus53: Allow multitag on that quest
[8:50:34] sxlyons: Swifty the respawn timer on den mother is like 5 mins or less.
[8:50:34] quenzar: I vote for multitag over grouping personally
[8:50:35] ThickFit: Hardcore, vs Hardcore Ironman. If you don't want trading/grouping, just have it as an option.
[8:50:46] avenomxx: you cant make such restrictions on official hardcore, the server won't disqualify you, everyone is HC
[8:50:49] AllenzoTV: all u gotta do is make a macro with an instant ability
[8:50:58] that408guy: flame trap all day
[8:51:10] quenzar: That still takes forever tho
[8:51:20] quenzar: Mages and Druids always get the tags first

[8:52:19] komunalec: that will seed up the quest but wont prevent trolls
[8:52:25] guss2084: thats why it hardcore and not easy mode
[8:52:28] quenzar: Ppl steal tags all the time in groups, HC or not
[8:52:48] quenzar: Would be better just to make those mobs free for all
[8:52:53] darkblad3s: !death

[8:52:59] Vahri: Nah, stand in line vahriXD
[8:53:52] quenzar: They should make the quest mobs free for fall
[8:53:55] quenzar: That would solve it
[8:53:56] AllenzoTV: I got the tag 2nd try as warrior

[8:55:29] XepppX: more difficult for you what hard core is
[8:55:33] Vahri: people who skip the lines suck,Just respect the line and everyone gets it. Some people are just rude
[8:55:57] Vahri: Its gonna happen cause people are rude
[8:55:59] topalphadog1: nobody gonna wait in line on official launch
[8:56:05] AllenzoTV: If u count 5+ people in the line, that's 25 minutes of doing nothing LUL lines are dumb

[8:57:41] DwarvenStream: one time another pulled mobs on me, and I just said "help" then he told me he will report me to hc discord and now I am invalid and must delete my character, some are taking this hc way too seriously and if that rule is true then it is very ridiculous!
[8:58:24] SekzeyPotatoe: Less rules the better
[8:58:26] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:58:28] AllenzoTV: Ur not suppose to ask for help or buffs Darven

[8:58:28] komunalec: mixed between current HC and no rules
[8:58:30] quenzar: I say same rules as now but quest mobs free for all, listo
[8:58:35] Goonzz999: bag ahead
[8:58:39] sxlyons: I think group finder should be allowed in classic/hardcore

[8:59:12] Hot_Sauce_Ross: if you're allowed to group when there isnt'a  line then it ceases to be hardcore
[8:59:15] Goonzz999: lol no you passed
[8:59:23] sanctus83: Maybe 2 types of creation options. Hardcore and Ironman
[8:59:38] C0DEXv2: or they can make it so you cant group but you can tag the mob and still get credit for it like on retail
[8:59:38] sanctus83: Ironman is all alone, hardcore is 1 life for anything
[9:00:02] AussieDave1980: The issue I am seeing is the definition of Hardcore and what it means to different people.
[9:00:15] Coast2Post: Blizz just needs to go the OSRS way and make different tiers of challenge. Hardcore Ironman and then maybe like an extreme iron with no bank lol

[9:00:53] Goonzz999: no lol right at start
[9:00:58] tundarian: How about non classic?
[9:01:17] sxlyons: I chose holy because I can‚Äôt stay alive. Otherwise I‚Äôd probably go paladin
