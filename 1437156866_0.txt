[0:58:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it seems that you dont have the tower yet
[0:58:50] lithium364: Ion says No :)

[1:20:55] HulkHogunn: seems like they really simplified the combat, it's just trying to get back on the right questline
[1:21:07] Xsilentghost: maybe 10.0 will change that
[1:21:13] Kakotan2143: WoW is the easiest to get back into
[1:21:40] Shrenko: I feel like GW2 is easier to get back into, because of how gear works
[1:22:26] Kakotan2143: SO @Towelliee So I think the name of the next Expack will be The Bonds of Fate, or those words will have something to do with it, at leastt. Those are the words of warning maybe prophcy that Miev shared with Khadgar
[1:22:36] Calphurnious: As long as I took care of my inventory in gw2 it's fine
[1:23:04] darkdestroz: @Towelliee have you tried out the "new" swtor yet?
[1:23:51] KragnosWoW: secret phase on jailer, this gonna take another week KEKW
[1:23:54] Kakotan2143: @nightblade19 as far as i know he didnt cause there wasnt much to the story
[1:23:56] lithium364: i thought it was malfurion making sure noone steals his wife in the shadowlands
[1:24:10] Kakotan2143: @KragnosWoW DID they find one?
[1:24:21] rohdey: WHAT IF; Khadgar is actually dead and thats his spirit in Oribos, or or or Dreadlord again
[1:24:25] Kinghorn: khadgar did you see they turned pelagos into a dildo?
[1:24:43] Calphurnious: @rohdey He did sound kinda sus
[1:24:44] Todmeister9000: the party in karazhan just finished
[1:25:02] Kakotan2143: Who was pelagos before he became pelagos?

[1:25:57] Shalamyne: @Towelliee The raven being Khadgar makes no sense tho, during the Jaina interaction he said he just arrived in Shadowlands, that raven has been there for awhile. It could be Medivh
[1:26:05] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee He was hybernating, and waiting for a right moment Kappa
[1:26:28] Kakotan2143: @Shalamyne YES
[1:26:35] Kakotan2143: I think you are right

[1:26:49] lilwird_o7: Just quit EVE online that game is so toxic.. WoW I friendly af compared to it
[1:26:54] Kakotan2143: it could have been Medivh
[1:27:19] Shrenko: new best attempt for Echo
[1:27:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo had the Jailer down to 11%, it looked like
[1:27:45] Shrenko: yeah, 18.6% in p4

[1:28:03] Keyastaron_: soon tm
[1:28:06] Eithos87: oh yea...it could be medivh

[1:32:01] pavepawns: remember. khadgar is here to pick up chicks
[1:32:09] LordOfDread: Someone say dreadlord?
[1:32:11] KragnosWoW: A wizard is never late, Master Baggins, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.
[1:32:26] KragnosWoW: thats what khadgar is gonna say to us
[1:32:27] Shalamyne: or it could be one of Odyn's ravens
[1:32:30] Thunderbrew: @KragnosWoW True Facts
[1:32:37] ShadoodHD: he must be sick and tired of us calling him shit wizard FeelsBadMan
[1:32:37] Kakotan2143: lol Khadgar wants a angel girl to fly him home tonight ;p

[1:47:04] KonaWolfeee: why would a subscription based game go on gamepass? is that a thing?
[1:47:29] KragnosWoW: it will never go on gamepass, thats gonna lose the company way too much money
[1:47:45] Nokterian: i remember when DK released during Wotlk and they where OP as can be with the old talent tree, i went with blood becoming unstoppable to be killed even elite mobs LUL
[1:47:45] Shalamyne: @KragnosWoW That is a lie
[1:47:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they put those systems designers to work on quality of life, 10.0 could be great for the WoWheads

[1:48:58] Nokterian: Aye
[1:49:05] Nokterian: i love timewalking
[1:49:05] Shalamyne: @KragnosWoW Because you are putting a 15$ sub fee on the game pass with hundreds of other games. Tell me how that loses money
[1:49:10] KragnosWoW: @dracullus its not doomsaying at all, its just hard to be positive thats all
[1:49:19] Thunderbrew: I agree, Timewalking every week.
[1:49:30] miztertea1: I agree.  There’s soooo much content that’s just left behind in WoW
[1:49:39] grapyz: Cant wait for the patch where old raids are still relevant, Thats gonna be huge IMO
[1:49:41] solegs100: for all those that are subbed on WoW that suddenly moves to Gamepass
[1:49:47] KragnosWoW: @Shalamyne why merge two 15 dollar subs?
[1:49:57] Calphurnious: @Shalamyne You do the math on this?
[1:49:59] Nokterian: GW2 has amazing dynamic events across each map
[1:50:11] RubbleyJ: i agree gw2 is fun to level, i still have end of dragons yet to play
[1:50:19] solegs100: it makes game pass more valuable and more of a success
[1:50:35] KragnosWoW: @Shalamyne 15+15 = 30. but 30-15=15
[1:50:38] Mr_O: so much content being skipped over too
[1:50:42] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I wish they think about more things like Mage tower for the next expansion, something challenging for ppl to have fun with
[1:50:52] Eithos87: I hate lvling and want it done asap
[1:51:09] Hypertitan: am I the only one that hates grimrail??  I never liked this dungeon
[1:51:12] bogeskov: Leveling raid?
[1:51:20] Selindrah: Man blizzard is like, we need more DEFILE, lol that phase 4 defile was insane haha
[1:51:23] RubbleyJ: leveling is just annoying when all the fun stuff is when you reach max
[1:51:31] Shalamyne: @KragnosWoW You won't, its technically gonna be a "free" sub thats added on the game pass for 15$, you arent paying 15 twice. Sorry should have worded that better
[1:51:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Quite a few people still buy those boosts because leveling is annoying, yeah
[1:51:36] Selindrah: for the jailer
[1:51:44] zerkx1: @Hypertitan that's because this was never suppose to be a dungeon
[1:51:47] Mr_O: There is a big difference in leveling an alt and leveling for the first time thou
[1:51:53] Herzenliegen: I loved the moving train concept as a dungeon.
[1:52:00] Nokterian: they need to stop throwing player power out of the window at the end of each expansion remember from legiion to bfa and classes became almost nothing?
[1:52:07] Calphurnious: The only way merging WoW onto the game pass makes them more money is indirectly from microtransactions from playing other games (if they do)
[1:52:08] Opsar: This on CM was so fun
[1:52:15] KragnosWoW: @Shalamyne that loses the company money dude KEKW
[1:52:17] yaellian: man watching you tank this place reminds me how much I hated that dungeon
[1:52:17] Thunderbrew: Timewalking can be done M+?
[1:52:23] PvtHudson093: i dont this one in M+
[1:52:42] lithium364: i voted for grimrail because its fun on low keys, i dont do high keys and do care if it sucks on 15+
[1:52:50] KragnosWoW: M+ isnt fun at all imo
[1:52:52] lithium364: *not
[1:53:06] Tokies: wod timewalking is so fast it's crispy
[1:53:06] Nokterian: slappy hands!
[1:53:10] Nokterian: LUL
[1:53:25] miztertea1: Just drop an ashen hollow and stand in everything and kill the boss
[1:53:29] Herzenliegen: Both times I did it the DPS just burned down the cannon.
[1:53:34] Shalamyne: @KragnosWoW Do you realize that people are getting hundreds of games with it also, that would make them more money. because more people will end up buying it. You also got people who just play on Xbox, who will want to try WoW...
[1:53:44] Nokterian: Wod timewalking is good did all 5 dungeons got a nice 252 trinket from the quest.
[1:53:47] KragnosWoW: the process of trying to find or join an m+ group is just not a fun experience, but the actual dungeon isnt bad
[1:54:05] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee todays "casual" guardian is where your class shines. Stagger tf out of everything for insane buffs. killed mine in 5 minutes lol
[1:54:12] zerkx1: @Nokterian blizzard does temp power gains because they're afraid of changing things up too much since after Cata and Mop it was clear to the team that players don't like change
[1:54:16] KragnosWoW: @Shalamyne that still loses the company money dude
[1:54:20] Kinghorn: ok 100% agree with that KragnosWoW but you just need to find some friends, which I also have trouble with
[1:54:46] Calphurnious: @Shalamyne Yeah, now that I think about it they'll probably make more money. Cause most people I know that play wow don't have an xbox game pass so they really wouldn't miss out on that much double dipping on subs
[1:54:47] KonaWolfeee: is this dude still on about gamepass? Blizzard would be dumb as fuck to do that lol
[1:55:10] KonaWolfeee: theyre not going to. its literal business 101. its dumb as shit to do so
[1:55:11] yaellian: Well they didn't move ESO to game pass so I agree with you @Towelliee
[1:55:19] Tzarvahl: You'll be able to download WoW from gamepass, but the sub isnt moving
[1:55:23] Thunderbrew: Why mess with a game that makes Money?
[1:55:27] crittinkitten: I bet they add gamepass to the WOW sub
[1:55:29] Shalamyne: @KragnosWoW Do you not see long term??
[1:55:43] Nokterian: Master Chief in WoW? Who knows.
[1:55:46] KonaWolfeee: @Shalamyne do you know anything about business? you seem to lack critical info lol.
[1:55:49] Shalamyne: @Calphurnious can't tell if this is sarcasm or?
[1:55:51] Thunderbrew: The Activision sale might not even happen
[1:55:51] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Lost Ark - Gunlancer Build Guide - Chad Tank Blue Boi youtu.be/wfakiiwn1F4
[1:56:01] yaellian: 20 USD for WoW and gamepass. That would be a steal
[1:56:10] ShadoodHD: grimrail depot, good times
[1:56:36] KragnosWoW: @Shalamyne bruh, gamepass wont double the amount of wow subs so long term it still doesnt make the company money
[1:56:55] Oraljelly: Grimrail was such a good dungeon
[1:56:59] yaellian: CHINA NUMBA 1
[1:57:07] zerkx1: Chat.. you do know that phil spencer actively plays Warcraft, right? they've been playing it since the tbc days
[1:57:49] yaellian: Its shocking how long this game has been out for.
[1:57:54] Tokies: they could sell wow like coming back home
[1:58:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: The amount that WoW makes per player is crazy, yeah
[1:58:44] ShadoodHD: i cant imagine wow being in game pass, especially when game pass is for both pc and console
[1:58:51] captiv8: captiv8 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[1:58:55] Nokterian: A young dude at my work is 18 years old..thats how long i have been playing this game LUL
[1:58:57] DaddyWarbuck: @Towelliee overall thoughts on Shadowlands?
[1:59:06] yaellian: I just want wow to be fun again. Sadge
[1:59:06] Kinghorn: they cater to china so hard they open up their classic raids on thursdays for their reset
[1:59:23] Calphurnious: @yaellian VoteYea
[1:59:36] KonaWolfeee: im 27. i think i started WoW the year it came out. i was a literal child and my mom paid for my sub LMAO
[1:59:48] Spaede: Spaede subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[1:59:52] ArcaneSyntax: wow's pretty fun right now.
[1:59:53] akacvrtops: @Towelliee  what you think of 9.2 so far?
[1:59:58] bigblue02005: i havent played wow since panda
[2:00:07] Tokies: I think selling it to the returners and "bring friends" might be the sale strat for wow.
[2:00:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's possible, not easy, but it can happen that WoW is fun again and rewarding and people want to play  10 hours a day again
[2:00:14] Nokterian: 9.2 is great
[2:00:18] ShadoodHD: that's why im on tbc classic, cause i had the best time of my life at that time :)
[2:00:24] KonaWolfeee: yeah i havent touched WoW since Post Legion. Expacs havent been as fun to ME. Legion was lit tho
[2:00:29] hagmania: it's fun enough to get me to play 2-3 months every expansion
[2:00:33] yaellian: I always come back when a new xpac come out lol. I just want MoP 2.0
[2:00:35] KonaWolfeee: imt come back for next expac
[2:00:46] Tokies: agreed plus the mog looks like the class more
[2:00:48] ItsBorland: Give me end of Legion as an entire expac
[2:00:52] ItsBorland: Fuck it was so fun
[2:00:58] Nokterian: Zereth Mortis is nice
[2:01:00] Zitchdogg: boring af
[2:01:01] Kinghorn: still better than jorthia
[2:01:02] Nokterian: it isn't the maw!
[2:01:03] KonaWolfeee: thats my pattern too. come back to new expac. notice it sucks. come back in 2 years lol. hopefully this next one isnt as bad as SL and BFA
[2:01:06] Kinghorn: korthia*

[2:01:46] yaellian: trhey dont know lol
[2:02:00] zerkx1: @KonaWolfee the next expansion is going to be dealing with timey whimey stuff and things will be retconned even more from what I've heard
[2:02:03] KonaWolfeee: ur beautiful
[2:02:04] ArcaneSyntax: did they buff timewalking? I trucked 5 timewalking dungeons this time around.
[2:02:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like the new zone too, but yeah it's weak on content
[2:02:24] flebbooo: I do atleast think just like with Nazjatar, Zereth mortis feels a lot better with flying
[2:02:29] Kinghorn: you can farm bees for hours like me trying to get A STUPID VESPOID LATTICE
[2:02:29] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[2:02:31] KonaWolfeee: @KonaWolfee they can retcon all the want. i just dont want moronic systems like weve had the past two expacs
[2:02:35] PvtHudson093: The creation matrix should already be out by now
[2:02:50] yaellian: The new zone reminds me of that island we had in MoP but a bit tone down. Cant recall the name of it.
[2:02:53] KragnosWoW: I killed argos phase 2 yesterday
[2:02:54] LordOfDread: People complained about power being tie to zone progression
[2:02:56] Nokterian: i just unlocked the mount from bastion getting all those shards
[2:03:00] jmalmin: No power too it. Well that is us the players fault complaining to much.
[2:03:15] Kinghorn: everyone has 4 set, give the casuals their tier
[2:03:22] Clicklesly: Yeah, we only get to use it on 1 piece first week i think?
[2:03:25] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW pathetically easy eh? Sadge. i heard p3 is even EASIER lol
[2:03:26] Oraljelly: @yaellian wasn’t it thousand islands?
[2:03:38] KragnosWoW: it took my group 88 minutes to kill argos, party 2 kept dying since they had no support or gunlance
[2:03:46] KonaWolfeee: yikes... lol
[2:03:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Timeless Isle has been a kind of paradigm for endgame zones
[2:03:56] jmalmin: A week CD
[2:04:02] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW push as much as you can without going broke for next week
[2:04:05] Oraljelly: @weirdo_dude that’s the name!
[2:04:10] yaellian: Dude season 4 sounds sick!
[2:04:48] caulpnrydc: the cross faction stuff is in 9.2.5 right?
[2:04:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I really liked Tanaan Jungle, I don't know why they went away from that
[2:04:57] yaellian: But its a good way to test out a new system into each season.
[2:04:59] Hypertitan: BRD!
[2:05:05] LordOfDread: Just the new expansion announcement an then we wait
[2:05:06] AureliusXV: season does not sound sick
[2:05:10] KragnosWoW: @KonaWolfee Im 1387, i wont be 1400 by next week for p3
[2:05:19] lithium364: atleast triumfirate isnt in it LUL
[2:05:20] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee we finally got our second support for next week <3 kragnos recently beat it!
[2:05:25] Synonymous: eh... recycled and tweaked old content? why is that fun? sounds like automatic take a break from wow
[2:05:26] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW trust me. i doubt we do p3 lol
[2:05:31] dracullus: I hope every season of M+ in the future will have base setup from current expac + few greatest hits from modern expacs (including WoD/MoP)
[2:05:36] PvtHudson093: thank god Shrine of the storm wasnt picked
[2:05:36] jmalmin: We are staying in this patch for at least a year. A expansion always comes about a year after it has been announced.
[2:05:38] Gurtogg: I wish they added waycrest manor again
[2:05:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Tanaan they had those pop-up events and everyone had time to get there for them, it was great
[2:05:44] yaellian: Hopefully they can add old school raids in future seasons.
[2:05:45] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW unless towliee has dumb luck i spent 150 bucks from 1390 to 1400 LOL
[2:06:02] miztertea1: What about this thing where we are going to vote for old dungeons to be added to m+ rotation?
[2:06:09] KragnosWoW: I feel like im the only person that loved emerald nightmare raid in legion
[2:06:16] Nevindaz: return to karazhan <3
[2:06:18] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW i loved it too
[2:06:18] Hypertitan: I wanna see BRD honestly....but I LOVED that dungeon before they split it up
[2:06:20] Kinghorn: as long as it is not cathedral and whatever the last legion dungeon was
[2:06:32] KonaWolfeee: Legion was my favorite expansion from the past like 6 years
[2:06:41] Synonymous: kara again?! no shot... NotLikeThis
[2:06:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: These days in Zereth, you see a blurb of text and you have to haul ass to get there and you often miss it....it's a pain
[2:06:52] lithium364: right now nothing
[2:06:53] yaellian: nothing? LUL
[2:06:54] Kinghorn: farming mount mats forever in ZM
[2:06:56] KragnosWoW: @KonaWolfee he may dip into his steam wallet, we'll see haha
[2:06:56] AureliusXV: all it said was  a new degree of difficulty
[2:07:01] jmalmin: Nothing has been announced for solo players yet.
[2:07:02] Sarocus: We dont care about the seasons
[2:07:08] AureliusXV: could be easier or harder
[2:07:12] NegativeNezzy: I read it as Heroic with affixes
[2:07:32] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW maybe maybe. i love being in group 2. group 1 seems annoying with the chameleon. group two is just stagger stagger stagger and 4 circles lol
[2:07:45] KragnosWoW: My birthday is on a lost ark reset next month so i hope valtan doesnt come out that day @KonaWolfee
[2:07:52] yaellian: I thought it would be heroic with an affixs
[2:08:00] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW i dont expect valtan until MY birthday in may lol
[2:08:15] NegativeNezzy: I skipped SoD so if it's mythic I just get benched for SOD weeks because there's 0 way I'm putting myself through Korthia
[2:08:37] KragnosWoW: @KonaWolfee may would be nice but idk what they would do for april to keep the higher up players active
[2:08:43] generalmarcus35: @towelliee do you think we get a Jailer WF kill today??
[2:08:56] DigiSeven: DigiSeven subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 77 months! 
[2:09:08] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW probably nothing. the events end in april. maybe a new event and thats it.
[2:09:12] KragnosWoW: didnt naow say there was a secret phase?
[2:09:14] mmrghost7: which dps specs play venth in m+ ? beside rogues
[2:09:33] KragnosWoW: season 4 in 6+ months
[2:09:54] Nokterian: 6+- months
[2:09:56] dracullus: Legion was 5.5 month
[2:10:00] CritcobainTV: HeyGuys
[2:10:04] KonaWolfeee: @KragnosWoW only reason i know for a fact they wont do valtan in april is because they made a mistake with argos. argos has been out for what? less than a month? a month? if they said thats too fast. they will wait at least 2 for valtan. which is may
[2:10:10] PvtHudson093: I reckon August
[2:10:11] yaellian: Oh I hope so!
[2:10:24] dracullatv: time to farm some domination gear KEKW for S4
[2:10:28] Nokterian: true
[2:10:35] KonaWolfeee: good because alliance dead af lol
[2:10:35] Kinghorn: finally get to play with you again andyYay
[2:10:43] KragnosWoW: @KonaWolfee ya good point, and p3 has probably been killed by less than 1% on NA
[2:10:49] flebbooo: A test and tease
[2:10:49] Thunderbrew: I think the Factions being able to play with each other is long overdue
[2:10:49] CritcobainTV: Liquid dropping the ball FeelsBadMan
[2:10:50] rohdey: Research and Development

[2:10:54] miztertea1: I’ll never play with alliance trash!
[2:11:05] yaellian: I am so going back to alliance once cross faction raiding becomes a thing
[2:11:08] dracullus: 9.2.5 must be way sooner than s4 since PTR started already
[2:11:15] AureliusXV: know thyre not im almost 3k io with pugging mostly
[2:11:18] Rudric_Ice: Echo will win this WFR
[2:11:26] AureliusXV: no*
[2:11:29] lithium364: i hope we get Forsaken Heritage Armor
[2:11:50] KragnosWoW: does echo win every race? when was the last time NA won a race? im not trolling btw i dont follow rwf
[2:12:05] Kinghorn: yeah this talk about dark iron getting some heritage weapons when basic races still dont have it
[2:12:15] CritcobainTV: @KragnosWoW 2 tiers ago? lol
[2:12:22] Luthaer: I wonder how the pushback from Blizzard employees on work conditions is impacting delivery of their product
[2:12:23] NegativeNezzy: @KragnosWoW Limit won the last few before Echo won last one
[2:12:23] nezz231: @KragnosWoW  they won in castle
[2:12:29] mmrghost7: dh orcs
[2:13:02] banescross12: @kragnoswow you can class they still beat like 7 out of 11 bosses first this season too
[2:13:13] Rudric_Ice: what's that timer for ?
[2:13:19] AureliusXV: i mean gear after the last seaon doesnt really matter
[2:13:23] CritcobainTV: @banescross12 16 hour headstart BabyRage
[2:13:32] AureliusXV: it wilkl get replace next expansion

[2:35:45] PvtHudson093: open some treasure boxes
[2:35:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I think running Torghast for flux might be fastest
[2:35:56] Kindosar: theres likely an easy 200 from one that unlocked to poeple after flying you haven't done
[2:36:00] sipilde: Some treasure give 200 each
[2:36:03] jmalmin: No wait you can buy cosmic flux but cinders and Ash for a legendary.

[2:37:41] caulpnrydc: makes the key
[2:37:41] Herzenliegen: It's not worth it
[2:37:50] CritcobainTV: Doing it before flying is nothing, cause nobody else had flying either KEKW
[2:37:52] PvtHudson093: you get that key from combining ephemeral strands together
[2:37:54] Westcoast17x: we getting wow 2 yet? lol

[2:39:09] CptTeempo: oh danP

[2:45:24] yunitoYuniro: They should be
[2:45:26] LordOfDread: Torghast grind Kappa
[2:45:33] KragnosWoW: If they add a grind it should be optional for player power and not be forced on casual players
[2:45:53] Screamnsteam: @Carahail oof lmao, so he had to do all that on multiple toons
[2:45:58] yunitoYuniro: They should add a mini toc type of raid later this summer just for some content
[2:46:09] Carahail: @Screamnsteam yep
[2:46:23] FranciscoTheMage: what was better @Towelliee Nathria or Sanctum? obviously sepulcher is the best

[2:46:35] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:46:47] KineasRM: IMHO, ppl need to realize what its really necessary for them to complete the type of content they want to do, i never had to grind, since BFA cause i know i only raid HC and do M+, so i honestly dont understand some of the ppls complaint
[2:46:53] Zitchdogg: What about m+players, will they get tier also?
[2:47:04] Broomba: AP grind was perfect for casual players I loved it
[2:47:07] Kinghorn: anyone can make it Zitchdogg

[2:47:40] Nokterian: aye
[2:47:44] Itzmorgan22: how do you upgrade legendary ilvl?
[2:47:46] KragnosWoW: @Broomba AP grind made it so u felt bad if u werent playing the game
[2:47:49] Kinghorn: it costs flux yeah
[2:47:52] captivate7: save any gear you get
[2:48:06] KragnosWoW: @Broomba u couldnt just take a break and log off, it made u feel like u had to put in 14 hours a day
[2:48:23] Broomba: AP was perfect and the catch up was spot on for alts
[2:48:28] CritcobainTV: i did lfr normal and heroic tier, apart from Lords of dread since i'm pugging, no luck yet
[2:48:34] KineasRM: wiat
[2:48:38] KineasRM: what is the catalyst?
[2:48:41] KineasRM: i'm lost
[2:48:55] Sarocus: Those of us that didnt grind AP were 2 levels behind those that did. Forced grind, my butt
[2:49:06] KragnosWoW: and then pugs became elitist requiring a certain AP level for heroic KEKW
[2:49:20] Kinghorn: same as everyone
[2:49:22] Kinghorn: LUL

[2:50:09] MrSapient: The boss of Amazon Game Studios has stepped down, the company has confirmed.
[2:50:11] KineasRM: what is that catalyst thing u guys were talking about and when it comes out?
[2:50:22] CptTeempo: KEKW
[2:50:25] Brodih_: its a Borderlands game in a D&D setting

[2:50:38] c0mmander_starscream: lol

[2:51:16] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee people on the internet are stupid enough to believe that a corporate head of a gaming studio has anything to do with the issues at hand lol.
[2:51:18] c0mmander_starscream: Jeff's not CEO anymore
[2:51:20] Nokterian: clearly a jeff bezos clone Kappa
[2:51:26] FranciscoTheMage: but maybe that means new world is gonna be closed
[2:51:27] c0mmander_starscream: The board is in charge now
[2:51:41] c0mmander_starscream: RIP Old WOrld
[2:52:08] KineasRM: most of behind the scenes changes doenst affect on going strategies on games, just the long term
[2:52:15] juga27: do you think world first jailer will happen before reset?
[2:52:49] FranciscoTheMage: what was better nathria or sanctum
[2:53:04] KragnosWoW: secret phase at 0%
[2:53:14] Kinghorn: nathria minus stone generals
[2:53:24] jure__: they are blasting on jailer, very impressive
[2:53:24] Armdel: don't they still have like zero experience of P4
[2:53:24] mavericks312: its echos kill to lose at this point

[2:54:33] KragnosWoW: its funny seein the RWF raiders tweet about wanting to go home to their families lmao
[2:54:41] FutileDiploma: @towelliee does the higher mythic level key give me higher loot? Sorry noob question
[2:54:43] N3llee: i saw some clip fo them at 10%?
[2:55:21] gary9496: 10 percent then p4 goes back up to 24 or something @n3llee
[2:55:29] FranciscoTheMage: and there won't be another raid tier for quite a while @Towelliee still no real leaks for big expac anncment?

[3:03:58] Folgrum: i think we will have more azeroth titan expack
[3:04:32] KragnosWoW: they should make past expansions relevant again and not by adding them to M+
[3:04:49] FranciscoTheMage: how would that work @KragnosWoW
[3:04:50] Folgrum: but anything withour arthas sylvanas will be good for me :)

[3:06:21] pereadin: You shoulda hollered for me in chat @towelliee coulda done this on a 15 for your KSM!
[3:06:45] Folgrum: then everyone can queue for more that 5 dungeos, it wont solve anything. bring flex 3-5 dps into party, solved
[3:07:21] Folgrum: also party with 4-5 dps will solve alot of meta slaves

[3:20:54] CritcobainTV: Arena pvp can be fun, but it just requires a LOT of practice. I've played for a long time and i've only ever been to like 2300 in arenas
[3:21:24] CritcobainTV: requires quite a bit of game knowledge, knowing what other classes do is really important

[3:27:38] CritcobainTV: go left here
[3:27:49] pereadin: The idea is to kill golem at the entrance or one of the corners so the orbs bounce back in one direction. One player can soak a max of 20 orbs which is what’s dispersed by the boss when it’s cast.

[6:13:17] Melonbrew: I don't raid, do get tier via M+ and the vault would be welcomed
[6:13:30] Exxcar: @Melonbrew you already do
[6:13:40] flebbooo: YEP
[6:13:45] Exxcar: Got lets on my warrior from his M+ options this week
[6:13:51] Exxcar: lets = legs*
[6:13:53] Melonbrew: @exxcar I know. I am meaning going forward after 9.2
[6:13:54] lithium364: then why not class power?
[6:14:12] 91Niki: We have had borrowed power since forever. Whether it's legendaries or artifacts
[6:14:15] 91Niki: Tier too yeah
[6:14:48] Exxcar: @Towelliee I just wish that the catalyst wasn't taking so long to come out
[6:15:04] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee it wasn't this way in vanilla.. how did it become like this. i still dont have my full giantstalker set
[6:15:14] akia03: and some grind to keep you busy like azerite power
[6:15:21] D3m0nHunt3r666: Domination sockets tastelessClown
[6:15:22] FranciscoTheMage: why everyone entitled to everything
[6:15:36] lithium364: soulbinds are so meaningless , i havent switched anything on them since 9.1
[6:15:42] NocturnalDragon: how are you doing today? i hope all is well! @Towelliee
[6:16:21] Molvonos: @lithium364 They're actually not.
[6:16:36] D3m0nHunt3r666: Do you have to do the campaign on an alt to get 2nd leggo?
[6:16:43] Kinghorn: prot warrior looking chonky
[6:16:45] akia03: prot war pvp is crazy atm
[6:16:54] Exxcar: @lithium364 They aren't meaningless, but from a player choice perspective, they are dull
[6:18:06] akia03: ya they 1 shoot you with shield slam and 4 piece

[6:18:34] Exxcar: @D3m0nHunt3r666 I don't think so. Once one toon hits revered and buys the runecarver memory, you should be able to craft it on any toon on your account
[6:18:48] Kinghorn: dragon covenants, you pick a dragonflight to champion for
[6:18:57] Kinghorn: andySmug
[6:19:00] PvtHudson093: it needs to be a telent for ret too
[6:19:10] akia03: for the free belt you have to do the campaign on all
[6:19:18] Exxcar: @Towelliee I'm just worried about what happens if we get another Legion to BFA where a lot of classes felt gutted after losing artifact abilities
[6:19:18] jerseyfive: hope so cant play prot paly anymore without it
[6:19:18] flebbooo: A lvl 70 talent row next xpac POGGERS
[6:19:26] lithium364: not a fan of that some abilties would probably  be a must have on some talent rows, like grappy hands for dks
[6:19:33] slumbilly808: grabby hands
[6:19:36] Agk90_: condemn is amzing
[6:19:38] Kinghorn: add convoke to the green dragonflight covenant
[6:19:39] theDirtyon3: we would need a new talent row
[6:20:09] Armsprotigy: Armsprotigy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[6:20:15] flebbooo: When was last we actually got a new talent row? wasn't it like wod
[6:20:19] Nurax88: soulbinds adds to much extra tuning for them to do and its just seems like a waste of time to what they could do
[6:20:37] akia03: the world boss island has allot of chest most of the time
[6:21:46] akia03: they would get bored
[6:22:15] lithium364: they need that extra balance time for tinker Kappa
[6:22:22] toobaked1987: Towelliee you are going to have a lot of fun collecting at the end of this excpansion
[6:23:09] NocturnalDragon: i felt like they shouldve added more with the covenants story wise kinda seemed lacking
[6:23:19] Sammael_Darksbane: I feel like, before they do that, they should stop getting sued for sexual harassment over and over.
[6:23:43] plout0n: because it's important.
[6:24:06] akia03: if you have 7 of those spatial openers you can get into the secret treasure room with 7 treasures
[6:24:19] NocturnalDragon: yeah that would've been amazing
[6:24:25] jkitchin75: @plout0n how is it to you just playing a game?
[6:24:52] plout0n: who makes the game?
[6:24:55] flebbooo: The worst part is knowing all these lore characters we met in SL will never make it beyond this xpac LUL
[6:25:21] Molvonos: You dont *need* 7
[6:25:31] Molvonos: You want them though since they do open the sandpits/chests.

[6:29:47] Exxcar: Microsoft will also probably not push them as hard and let them take a bit more time if they need it
[6:29:50] jkitchin75: well it cant be as bad as the last 2
[6:29:51] Gayjesus_420: no one plays retail anymore huh

[6:30:35] Storvn: @Exxcar Back when  I was into it pretty hard Necro  bloods were rare. I think most were Kyrian. I havent played since  early SoD tho
[6:30:40] jkitchin75: so he got the mount from tw?
[6:31:05] urashh12: that was a clean ui suite. miss it. everything is elvui now

[6:32:28] kokochris: they need wrath out, the next expansion is far away
[6:32:50] jkitchin75: everything in zm wants to kill you
[6:33:06] Cabbageman007: Turn addon off..the reg World Map will show Skull and Bones
[6:33:14] Exxcar: @kokochris They probably won't do Wrath till TBC content cycle is done
[6:33:15] Cabbageman007: when a rare is up
[6:33:32] NocturnalDragon: id definitely might play wraith since i started playing around that time

[6:34:34] kokochris: I've been horde since cata.
[6:34:38] ContraRob: I just mean based on the Classic to BC cycle, which was in between WoW Expacs
[6:34:41] Exxcar: @ContraRob I think the Classic release are more about finishing the content of the previous one
[6:34:47] Rhydoe: rhydoe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! towHAMUP
[6:34:49] Hitokiri83: @Towelliee did u see the new Dark Iron Xmog from a few days ago

[6:40:25] TacDuc: Eyyy, you said my name correctly this time :D
[6:40:29] Exxcar: @GcoBASED I'm back in, just trying to work up the drive to find a new raiding guild XD

[6:50:47] PvtHudson093: I really dont like that you cant explore those islands on the map

[6:55:13] jingshin: Blizz doesnt make the game very fun to replay and for some people thats neither a problem or a solution to what their goals are with the game.. like having a geared alt for raiding
[6:55:54] Fusionxw: Any games that gets involved with Esport (especially an MMO game) will die. its like extracting all the juice from it only to become dust.
