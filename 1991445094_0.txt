[2:59:17] AceOfHalo2: @MACH1_G I use a 32inch TV to play xbox, anything bigger and you need to turn your head to see the whole screen. Then sit in an office chair infront of it. Best set-up ever.
[2:59:24] HonorGuard99: @xGTExDopey he is optimizing it for faster reloads as a headsup by looks
[2:59:38] MACH1_G: @AceOfHalo2 LUL mach1gClap mach1gClap mach1gClap

[3:00:20] HonorGuard99: @nicodemus699 for the game or?
[3:00:20] sn1zzled: You're to good in this game
[3:00:23] xeraxic: @MACH1_G so do those things not cost money? believe it or not they do, its part of the setup to play it so why not calculate it too? its only fair, and you're not accounting for people possibly having a desk in their house, a random chair etc.
[3:00:24] TheLuxael: @nicodemus699 yeah tab

[3:00:54] xeraxic: you can just not want a pc but this isnt a stable hill to stand on
[3:00:59] xGTExDopey: @HonorGuard99 the supp pack toon camo gives you +10 reload so maybe basic mags?
[3:01:06] nicodemus699: @TheLuxael i mean their game, watching twitch

[8:33:51] mk6adam: retail = current/mkdern iteration (faster leveling, more focus on end game rewards like mounts and transmog) and classic is on wotlk right now and its slower leveling process more of a time suck haha

[9:33:47] sussstin: @ezosrs prob no better time to try it out than now
[9:33:47] PheonixAngel99: @pingleawk so you thinking not worth if a new player bc it doesnt really update also does this mean this new season is only for classic and didnt effect retail?

[9:34:20] Remember: @shroud i miss the old mike and lan events
[9:34:20] ABventures: @PheonixAngel99 if your completely new to wow you would probably get more overall content in retail, both take time to learn
[9:34:21] r3ckoningv: Are you going to play En-Shrouded?

[9:34:44] MikeLitoris06: @shroud is there a way to join the guild ?
[9:34:49] PheonixAngel99: @ABventures MSKES SENSE
[9:34:50] CombatActionDad: So this is Retail, what do people call the other one?
[9:34:52] bloomin_onion: retail takes a lot longer to learn than classic
[9:35:05] RockTh3Casbah: 1k needles
[9:35:06] diirtyd_21: will you try the day before if it really comes out?
[9:35:06] sussstin: @ABventures but SoD would also be a good soft intro as theres not too much to learn
[9:35:09] RockTh3Casbah: dunno
[9:35:10] garthorama11: @CombatActionDad this is classic, not retail
[9:35:11] Efite: 137
[9:35:11] SpitDart: @CombatActionDad this isn't retail
[9:35:14] Hartneydown: Anyone know where to get Sunfrire for Night Elfs

[9:35:43] DreadfuryDK: Watching out of interest, but this Season of Discovery thing REALLY isn't for me.
[9:35:57] mandurilxl: still looks meh @francophone123

[9:36:26] loli_alexa: Healbolt
[9:36:28] madabber_: cant even make judgements yet on sod
[9:36:35] FSfalcon: why flametoung wep?
[9:36:59] garthorama11: @CombatActionDad Classic is the original content with a few tweeks, and + is a step further and retail is 20 years of content progression and yes people still play retail
[9:37:09] ABventures: @sussstin yes and no, they have different systems overall but both are gonna require learning the classes and abilities and general but i think retail would probably hold your hand a little more
