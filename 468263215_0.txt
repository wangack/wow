[0:06:08] Xyronic: also the way the current meta is, the top 3 teams in the west can just play rogues as a comfort comp and make the other teams try to innovate
[0:06:13] assrug: bonez91789 it's asia cup so because of timezones

[6:08:19] DimAle: classic wont die guys its not a 2 months game. retail is.

[6:08:43] Flashgasm: cause the way they got their deaths is just hilarious some pugs run smoother
[6:08:45] Rym_: Classic was NEVER meant to survive over BFA, classic was meant to keep wow going until 9.0 comes
[6:08:46] LezardFleck: @pancholism thats pretty common, its the issue with trying to keep growth with any games while they try to reduce churn from players leaving... it happens with most popular games
[6:08:55] Nano_SM: Everyone who actually played Classic back in the days was in there Teens, now they are grown up and have absolutly no time for Classic anymore.

[6:10:55] boykamode: @Flashgasm you would never make it to MDI <3
[6:10:55] MrDraQ: People look at Classic sentimentally. It was the first such game with huge success. They think it will be played the same way as it was 15 years ago, but it will not

[6:11:38] HeAtStRoKeDeAd: wow retail got lame when they took the uniqueness away from each class.. druids not even having MOTW any more is a shame!
[6:11:39] DimAle: @b14cks0ul no i havent but i also dont believe in mythic plus and harder and harder difficulty as "new" content as this is cheap . I m more of a pvp guy and i ll play classic for that reason
[6:11:49] LezardFleck: @Flukeyy its not only class design, class desing is the symphom not the disease, unless blizzard changes teh ENTIRE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY next xpac will be just as bad as bfa
