[3:56:52] jack_magnum99: Doing anything Online in Costa Rica is very smooth and easy. I looked into it. They aren't strict and encourage people to do business there. And since Costa Rica is NOT a part of the U.S., It's up to you to declare whatever you win to your prospective governments,wherever you live.
[3:57:03] SuperdaveUp: @Towelliee  back in the day ACR Bought the site and members list to switch to Americascardroom from Doyles room may 2011 ive been here ever since!

[3:57:51] TrillionaireTMB: nah he just gets TT every hand
[3:57:58] kokochris: @Broomba nah, it wasn't slow (provided you were in NA, hitting NA servers for instance). I went from 14.4, 28.8, 56k to cable modems throughout the 90s.  when 2000 hit, most sites were still designed for the dialup era.
[3:58:02] SuperdaveUp: how goes @banejahpoker glgl
[3:58:25] Big_Wanshan: people dont just raise because they have a good hand unless they dont know poker

[5:04:26] thegemini27: they show aref running in when play starting
[5:04:28] Turguson: That was on the refs, they called the play dead late after the snap.

[6:13:14] BeaverButtGoo: @Towelliee its tear drops, if you play it.. lol..
[6:13:15] EdgyKoala: i dont know the drama .. i like Harry Potter and dont need to know it .. i think her team is helping with the new game and she isnt involved
[6:13:33] UruPokerFace: AA vs KK le tira la k a mi rival... que merde
[6:13:40] EdgyKoala: i love the stories .. i am not into the politics
[6:13:41] luckfore: its the cancer culture
[6:13:43] luckfore: cancel*
[6:14:23] firelane: they didn't cover you
[6:14:34] JFeezy__: the graphics look pretty sick
[6:14:37] LX2_EXE: wow
[6:14:39] Heero_Effect: Imma play it. Because I like Harry Potter
[6:14:44] LX2_EXE: shit is getting deep
[6:14:52] EdgyKoala: What .. how is playing Harry Potter being transphobic
[6:15:05] luckfore: if you wanna play it, play it. dont let others tell you what you can and cant do
[6:15:06] Runezin: i watched the 11 min gameplay video, im super excited to play iy
[6:15:17] raldrik: That is why the counter cancel culture gets so load and gains momentum. Only the sith deal in absolutes
[6:15:17] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:15:21] Molehj: @EdgyKoala The author has shared those views
[6:15:34] snake_like: if you drink nestle bottled water then you're a rainforest destroying, human rights violator, right? NODDERS
[6:15:46] trivotix: That is like saying if you play Blizz games you agree with sexual assualt.
[6:15:47] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[6:15:48] LX2_EXE: Pretty ridiculous
[6:15:49] themaxpower1: the people that made the game have no association to her either....they are just working on a licensed IP that she created 20 years ago
[6:16:00] sgreth: Welcome to cancel culture. It's so sad....
[6:16:01] Gremaldy: lol, so riduculous
[6:16:05] Turguson: Regardless if you agree with JK or not, props to her for speaking her mind, even knowing the backlash she would receive.
[6:16:08] xenophicz77: That is caqncel culture at its finest bro
[6:16:14] LX2_EXE: The problem is being scared to stream though honestly
[6:16:19] krazykat1183: As a member of the LGBT community, her opinion doesn't matter to me... if you want to play a game...play it!
[6:16:24] Molehj: Like towel said, they equate playing the game with agreeing with JK Rowling, which is ridiculous
[6:16:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: For smaller streamers it can be real pressure, they don't have a comfortable following
[6:16:32] kimmo_gaming: what do you mean there is only 2 genders in Harry Potter LOL
[6:16:32] firelane: they still dont' cover you
[6:16:33] Dalrend7640: I just play the game to play the game, its supposed to be fun, not political
[6:16:55] luckfore: just stream it and ban them
[6:16:58] luckfore: f em
[6:17:13] Ryvden: lol i might actually get streamers if i play it lol
[6:17:17] dano9: Do you play any more New World?
[6:17:18] trivotix: Worse case scenario, the smaller streamers get more viewers even if they are hate viewers
[6:17:35] Runezin: put chat in mod only mode and have your mods battle it out LUL
[6:17:45] geokouts: 1 main 2 side

[6:18:46] Runezin: @Runezin good call LUL
[6:18:54] Molehj: there are going to be people joining streams just to spread hate about it
[6:18:57] Molvonos: If people want to bring in the stupid, they'll be swiftly removed.

[6:19:37] Molvonos: You know why I deleted your message.
[6:19:42] aFatManOnaCouch: double rebuy
[6:19:51] LX2_EXE: @luckfore Well that's the problem. Sometimes the smallest voice is the loudest in the age of Social Media. Those who don't care don't say anything.
