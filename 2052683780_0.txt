[0:22:01] bgibson3393: You still prequesting mendo?
[0:22:37] bgibson3393: glad i used questing to lvl
[0:22:45] bgibson3393: i got so many of the quest done already
[0:23:31] bgibson3393: nice
[0:23:33] lerler: You doing RFK till 30?
[0:23:56] lerler: ah true
[0:23:58] bgibson3393: do we know if they added more runes for phase 2
[0:23:58] lerler: ure
[0:24:00] lerler: ally
[0:24:20] lerler: we are doing BFD -> Quest Stack -> RFK -> SM
[0:24:45] lerler: we are going for top 10 Gnomer
[0:25:38] lerler: i just like the prep it has been so fun
[0:25:44] lerler: and also running its going to be fun
[0:26:14] bgibson3393: new pvp should be amazing
[0:27:03] lerler: We have 4 locks
[0:27:11] lerler: including island (for warriors) summon
[0:27:34] lerler: we have 2 groups speedrunning
[0:27:39] lerler: cuz the goal is getting into gnomer
[0:28:04] lerler: We have warriors, feral, a rogue, shaman and 2 priest
[0:28:27] lerler: Yeyey hoping we dont need it in gnomer, if we do then we have to find a mage in the end
[0:28:36] lerler: but honestly i dont think we will need it
[0:28:59] lerler: what i need to do yet is calculate what dungeon to do and what part
[0:29:30] lerler: from 25-40
[0:29:35] lerler: Like what range is the limit
[0:30:03] lerler: so BFD + quest stack, if the leaks are correct, BFD will almost give u a whole level
[0:30:12] lerler: which kinda threw me off
[0:30:51] lerler: yeah and theres like 100 mobs inside the instance
[0:31:03] lerler: i think so too, i think we finish fast
[0:31:07] lerler: and get out
[0:31:42] Fossabot: How do you earn points on Liquid+? Check here >> https://tl.gg/points
[0:31:51] Venomous: yo if i just walk out the dungeon and walk back in will this guy respawn
[0:31:54] Honeypaw: I have 6 rn how much xp you think they gonna give
[0:31:54] Venomous: or what i gotta do for him to come back
[0:32:06] lerler: we did not, im not sure how much thats going to be ghonestly, but i feel like its better to spend the gold in high consumes

[0:33:17] lerler: well what they said is past level 25 they will buff xp, not sure if that means NEW ones will give more xp or the current ones will
[0:33:25] lerler: it wasnt clear
[0:34:36] lerler: i have inside information not confirm but i have a good leak
[0:34:41] lerler: that WSG isnt going to give any xp
[0:35:02] lerler: so im jsut going to do the 18 wsg marks
[0:35:28] Honeypaw: I would not be suprised if that is the case at all
[0:35:52] lerler: idk i have a leak from a dev saying 'i wouldnt bet on wsg giving xp'
[0:36:10] lerler: but you know its blizzard, maybe they just say fuck it do it

[0:38:12] lerler: i think if youre prepared, top 100 is easy
[0:38:26] lerler: i tyhink u without having another team can get into gnomer easy
[0:39:08] lerler: i see
[0:39:20] lerler: im going warrior first, then im levelling maybe another warrior or shaman
[0:39:28] lerler: me too :/
[0:39:50] lerler: im doing the race cuz its what i like doing, i races in frontier too in hardcore, its just fun
[0:40:39] lerler: i do think gnomer is going to be more interesting of a speedrun than bfd tho
[0:40:43] lerler: just on the layout
[0:40:55] Honeypaw: are you gonna respec shadow completely at 40
[0:41:15] lerler: YESSS DUDE
[0:41:20] lerler: gnomer hardmode is needed
[0:41:33] ozsiewqi: i like ez pve just run thru it and do pvp
[0:41:33] lerler: Okay mendo tell me if im wrong in this
[0:41:41] ozsiewqi: only do pve for the roleplay LUL
[0:41:47] lerler: Catering to casuals damages games
[0:41:52] lerler: am i wrong
[0:42:08] ozsiewqi: equalizes gear between casuals and better plays in pvp though
[0:42:14] ozsiewqi: players
[0:42:23] lerler: Casuals have nothing to look up to, everyone has the same gear, same level, no inspiration
[0:44:17] lerler: but yeah the boxes thing i dont think ill do, i would have to get both teams to do it and i dont think they will
[0:44:35] lerler: exactly
[0:45:00] lerler: also, idk if you have noticed, we are going to have an insane amounts of spells if they keep adding spells to runes LOL
[0:45:11] lerler: unless runes become like QoL shit
[0:45:39] RangeRns: i have a feeling lucas will always be preoccupied with rust
[0:45:51] lerler: yeah but it makes some classes insane to play, liek for example, imagine pvp shaman
[0:46:01] lerler: 4 totems + 3 shocks
[0:46:05] RangeRns: uh
[0:46:06] lerler: + rotation abilities
[0:46:09] RangeRns: lemme open
[0:46:28] lerler: what server is this
[0:46:29] RangeRns: do i need a summon to south shore ?
[0:46:47] lerler: wtf is this summon hgoly fuck hahaha

[0:58:00] JDXL: u not looting the fish oil?
[0:58:03] JDXL: thats gold
[0:58:07] lerler: truee
[0:58:11] CorrivoQC: i have 2k h watching rust never played
[0:58:51] lerler: Will warrior be best class at 40
[0:58:51] CreatisBot: @lerler Very doubtful
[0:58:58] lerler: holy shit
[0:59:05] lerler: not according to the 8 ball
[0:59:06] JDXL: for pve?
[0:59:07] lerler: im rerolling
[1:00:00] lerler: yeah most likely, i wouldnt go into RFK with pugs
[1:00:04] lerler: its going to take years to get out
[1:00:05] JDXL: is phase 3 lvl 50 cap
[1:00:08] JDXL: or what
[1:00:11] lerler: yeah 50
[1:00:15] JDXL: i see
[1:00:19] CorrivoQC: scarlet is so fun
[1:00:23] lerler: phase 3 seems kinda bleh
[1:00:32] JDXL: i wanna do the real raids
[1:00:38] lerler: like what class becomes better at 50, maybe feral
[1:00:42] JDXL: the molten core and bwl
[1:01:43] JDXL: mhm
[1:01:57] Deathnote_Light: nax out?
[1:01:57] lerler: naxx is fun, but not in WOTLK
[1:02:22] Fossabot: How do you earn points on Liquid+? Check here >> https://tl.gg/points
[1:02:25] lerler: WOTLK naxx was a joke, which made it so boring
[1:02:36] lerler: also paladins with ultra giga aoe was like bleh

[1:03:10] lerler: bro i think they gonna make level 40 longer than 2 months
[1:03:17] lerler: watch it be 3-4 months
[1:03:22] CorrivoQC: yes
[1:03:25] lerler: just because dads havent raided yet
[1:03:35] emking_: theres a road map of when the phases will come out
[1:03:44] lerler: bro if u take 2 months to raid, that player is not raiding again bro, why cater to those people
[1:03:46] emking_: not exact dates but like estimates
[1:04:16] emking_: yeah so far stuff for next phase is looking nice
[1:04:17] lerler: catering to casuals who play the game 1 hour a day, shouldnt be the focus, your actual player base is sweaty, and having no sweat to have kills the game
[1:04:25] lerler: casual people need sweaties
[1:04:36] JDXL: oh also i woke up to a massive nuclear drama
[1:04:40] JDXL: ome5
[1:05:11] CorrivoQC: i was happy to see you on rust
