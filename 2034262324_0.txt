[0:04:57] FuruF: hasHi
[0:07:32] FuruF: Just blame the DPS for pulling extra mobs
[0:07:44] Brotrain: Brotrain subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! PartyPls
[0:08:22] Guffels: THAST MY KIND OF ROUNDING
[0:08:27] Guffels: caps wtf
[0:08:41] SevzyYEP: Mans excited about rounding
[0:09:49] s_dawg1: Good Morning JB
[0:16:54] yctnm: Sadge
[0:17:42] zashar_: Same thing happened to Ellesmere a couple of days agor
[0:17:46] zashar_: is a bug
[0:17:47] FuruF: I've seen this bug happen a few times now
[0:18:07] LegendofEnigma: I had a bug on the council boss in EB that green swirlies were not showing up
[0:18:23] FuruF: Blizzard wants EB to just be harder.
[0:19:06] WingedChipmunk: wtf did i just tune into? how did you catch hands with nothing happening?
[0:19:24] LegendofEnigma: that tornado infront of you was carrying debris from the nearby town and smacked you in the head. Only possible solution
[0:20:39] treavorthenusance: banging 30's like a true swinger
[0:21:34] Nico_vdM: DiCaprio would say that 25+ is too high
[0:22:08] Arkrisen: What up @jdotb! Good morning!
[0:22:11] Korupcija_: Sadge
[0:22:49] caradea_: sup all
[0:25:07] treavorthenusance: i feel like under 25 throne is easier on tyran weirdly enough
[0:27:12] Nico_vdM: or if the totem doesnt kill your tank
[0:29:20] zhanatos: Jdotb play Classic SOD the real wow experience duuuude!!!!
[0:29:41] yctnm: communicate Sadge
[0:31:10] SevzyYEP: Sucks but it's better than grabbing a random and having a shit time
[0:31:41] SevzyYEP: Hill Factory Sadge
[0:32:27] SevzyYEP: Just force Ben to come back and play on EU 4Head
[0:33:05] WytherOK: WytherOK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[0:33:40] SevzyYEP: smelling MW MDI meta
[0:34:43] SevzyYEP: unholy DK inc I swear
[0:34:56] s_dawg1: Theres no way aug is meta in MDI
[0:35:06] Guffels: isnt mdi the best place for Aug since its all about doing 1 pull every 2 minutes?
[0:35:13] WytherOK: daily aug was a mistake comment
[0:37:01] s_dawg1: Is MDI still only allowed 1 of each class?
[0:37:33] s_dawg1: So0 maybe havoc and veng
[0:37:48] SevzyYEP: Hunter POGGIES
[0:38:20] SevzyYEP: I heard some shit about double rogue, that a meme?
[0:38:50] s_dawg1: Theres going to be a wild comp that brings a frost and fire mage
[0:39:10] Siraeyou: What do you think DPS DK would potentially need to be more viable at high level keys?
[0:41:37] s_dawg1: The whole first platform of Rise
[0:42:06] s_dawg1: Though thats probably just how well you can use the mother
[0:43:31] Aggroboy: theres AMZ and grip i guess....
[0:43:53] Siraeyou: AMZ, grip and Brez but that doesn't feel even close to enough
[0:45:09] Insertname4321: I feel like plate dmg dealers are in shambles rn LUL
[0:45:23] Insertname4321: they thought the lego was gonna be way better than it actually is mayhaps
[0:45:33] Oranssi_: Meeres goes hard right know as Unholy
[0:46:22] Aggroboy: Meeres goes hard on any spec
[0:46:26] Insertname4321: ^
[0:46:49] Siraeyou: havoc, monk, rogue basically
[0:47:11] Aflictionn: as a new player, whats harder balance druid or shadow priest?
[0:47:17] Aflictionn: also which is less apm as i have bad hands lol
[0:47:36] Wiseved: wassup jb
[0:47:37] murkhouse: They should give DK a leech group buff
[0:47:49] Insertname4321: that wouldn't make them meta though
[0:47:57] Insertname4321: leech is only so good like leech in this season would be doggo
[0:48:42] Insertname4321: I think DK just needs a rework they are the same class they were in 2016
[0:48:50] ren0m: What's the situation with meta in DF - is everything playable at a decently high level, or are there 5-6 specs that are must-have?
[0:48:55] ren0m: Outside of top 0.1%
[0:49:05] Guffels: !wa
[0:49:43] Siraeyou: This is probably the most flexible the tank/heal spots have been in awhile
[0:50:06] ren0m: It makes me wonder if it's worth mining one class or if I will struggle to get groups when meta shifts.
[0:50:09] Insertname4321: do you think 30+ blood dk is still super viable?
[0:50:24] LegendofEnigma: I played swapped to frost mage this week just to change things up a bit and noticed taking longer to get into groups compared to fire lol
[0:50:33] Insertname4321: In 30+ it just seems like they would get melted before they can set up
[0:50:37] Aggroboy: @Siraeyou not sure about tanks
[0:50:56] ren0m: The longevity of any given spec is what I'm worried about.
[0:51:09] ren0m: Fire mage is in meta now, but what will happen in 3 months?
[0:51:24] Aggroboy: 3 months? isn't that season 4?
[0:51:36] ayydooo: would you say 20s this season are more similar to 16s last season
[0:51:49] kuntoilija: im jb, and i turned off mentions at me from my own discord server
[0:51:51] Insertname4321: season 4 they get back the season 2 set which will be buffed
[0:52:03] LegendofEnigma: Fire mage damage profile is mostly what is still carrying it right? With being an absolute tank
[0:52:04] Insertname4321: so I think they will be even better than they are now LUL
[0:52:05] ren0m: Just an example. I guess it's best to "main" 2-3 classes rather than focus on one due to meta shifts.
[0:52:13] drdrozd12: that happened to hpal
[0:52:29] misterworldhide: just main a class with utility and survivability and not a hunter
[0:52:31] drdrozd12: last season
[0:52:38] Insertname4321: Just main a class you enjoy
[0:52:47] kuntoilija: im jb, and i turned off mentions at me from my own discord server.
[0:52:53] Insertname4321: Who cares about pushing to the maximum if you are not having fun playing the game
[0:52:56] drdrozd12: and shadow
[0:53:09] Guffels: @jdotb can you grab the custom code line for the jedi sound effect from the mb timer weakaura? I lost mine
[0:53:15] ren0m: @Insertname4321 that's the plan, but I'm wondering how flexible the meta is.
[0:53:25] ren0m: I won't enjoy a class if it isn't getting invited anywhere
[0:53:39] Insertname4321: Yo udon't have to worry about not getting invited until really high keys tbh
[0:53:57] Insertname4321: I am playing Frost dk a lot and getting invited pretty regularly to 22-25s
[0:54:07] ren0m: That's what I was asking. So anything is solid at a relatively high lvl.
[0:54:08] REGENAROCKET: @Insertname4321 kinda, but honestly even 15's people are so picky
[0:54:15] LegendofEnigma: Am I crazy to prefer overgrowth over Flourish
[0:54:21] ren0m: And I for sure won't become one of the top 1%
[0:54:29] Aggroboy: feels like VDH is quite ahead of other tanks
[0:54:41] Insertname4321: Yeah anything sub 20 is gonna be a pain but 20+ most players are better at the game
[0:55:08] RemwayTV: I still think theres a skill and attitude gap between 20 and then 25+
[0:55:13] Insertname4321: and understand comfy > meta but thats my experience it differs between players tbh
[0:55:21] RemwayTV: like clearly a skill but attitude for sure
[0:55:32] ren0m: That's good. I prefer druid anyway.
[0:55:35] drdrozd12: mage lul
[0:55:46] ren0m: Guardian seemed fun in S1
[0:55:47] drdrozd12: rarely not meta
[0:55:50] Aggroboy: druid is pretty safe if you can play both balance and resto
[0:55:51] ren0m: I assume it's a solid pick still
[0:56:13] drdrozd12: warlock for raiding i guess, rarely shit
[0:56:50] Bakhadi: only thing druids can really complain about is that feral is rarely meta. except for feral youâ€˜ll always be good tho
[0:57:05] Aggroboy: Bear is also very seldom meta
[0:57:18] Aggroboy: nvm meta, how about viable
[0:57:24] drdrozd12: pally is also normally meta (prot/holy)
[0:57:38] Insertname4321: I think its kinda rough for guardian its the "beginner" tank so if they buff it, tanks will just be straight up boring
[0:57:39] RemwayTV: @jdotb do you basically stay in bear form p1 of BRH last boss on like 28+ fort/27+ tyran?
[0:57:40] ren0m: So, from what I gathered, meta is more defined by picky people than how useful the classes/specs really are.
[0:57:47] kelly_mac06: yea pally is strong at least on one spec it seems
[0:57:56] kelly_mac06: also. Morning JB
[0:58:07] Bakhadi: i think bear is good right now. maybe not 29 key level good but good
[0:58:07] Kinzarro: pala has a lot of utility, so almost always worth bringing
[0:58:27] drdrozd12: u should join the tank key as bear
[0:58:48] drdrozd12: just press thrash, cant be that hard
[0:58:51] kelly_mac06: @Kinzarro absolutely!
[0:59:11] RemwayTV: do you have to perma ramp or do u just heal everyone during beam/blade?
[0:59:23] RemwayTV: cause thats nutty - did my first 28 tonight and felt chaos
[0:59:46] Aggroboy: lots of one-shots this season
[0:59:48] LegendofEnigma: Time to swap to bear and and go join that AD
[1:00:33] drdrozd12: but ye, druid and pally usually have at least one meta spec. both have insane utility that makes them good even if their dps/hps is mid
[1:01:23] SevzyYEP: Jdotbear go
[1:01:36] ren0m: Is there any YT content creator that does guides for all dungeons?
[1:02:02] SevzyYEP: sp/boomie kicks monkaW
[1:02:15] drdrozd12: shaman for the kicks
[1:02:16] LegendofEnigma: shaman time to shine
[1:02:31] cbaprod: Sup JB
[1:02:42] kuntoilija: @drdrozd12 druid? insane utility?
[1:02:45] kuntoilija: hmm
[1:02:57] LegendofEnigma: what dps spec would you like to play?
[1:03:00] xcvxcvxcvxcvxcvxcv: Jdot, opinion for bm Hunter in this period of the game ? about m+ ?
[1:03:04] SevzyYEP: You had the itch with aug, something needs scratching, bring back your rogue POGGIES
[1:03:13] Shkafche: what did i hear? jdotzug time ?
[1:03:18] Dinokaze: @ren0m Tactyks makes guide s for all dungeons for low level range, 20s, and 1%s versions
[1:03:23] SevzyYEP: I wonder how many people know that you played rogue in MDI once
[1:03:29] doobii_: haven't seen you DPS since lower kara
[1:03:41] ren0m: @Dinokaze thank you
[1:03:48] kuntoilija: Kapp
[1:03:58] Childz: what dps would you pick if you decided to do that?
[1:04:16] SevzyYEP: Gotta be boomie or aug
[1:04:29] Buffiin: its weird to me that disc is higher than druid but i feel like i heal better with druid. maybe play style.
[1:04:37] kuntoilija: #bringbackHillfactory
[1:04:54] xcvxcvxcvxcvxcvxcv: @jdotb  Jdot, opinion for bm Hunter in this period of the game ? about m+ ?
[1:05:21] ShwoogityWoogity: work on your accent
[1:05:26] ren0m: Is there a big difference?
[1:05:29] SevzyYEP: Go back to NA and start a team with jpc GIGATON
[1:05:32] 1_7_4: Come to oce xd
[1:06:10] SevzyYEP: IRL conflicts Sadge
[1:06:15] WytherOK: you could stream demon hours, midnight to 8 am
[1:06:17] WytherOK: then sleep all day
[1:06:24] WytherOK: and hang with family after they get out
[1:06:40] kuntoilija: dude you play all day anyway
[1:06:44] kuntoilija: 8 hour streams
[1:06:45] kuntoilija: daily
[1:06:52] drdrozd12: 14 hours a day just doesnt sound very healthy
[1:07:05] SevzyYEP: Surely there's a team willing to do average hours on most weeks but then put push week aside for degen week, no?
[1:07:10] kuntoilija: thats like 4 times more than i want to play daily
[1:07:39] s_dawg1: Those hours really make the .1% title sounds exhausting
[1:07:44] misterworldhide: most days its hard to get someone to even say hi in wow
[1:09:16] s_dawg1: The cutoff is around 3500
[1:09:28] SevzyYEP: gogo zero to hero every healer, from 0 IO to .1% in 2 weeks
[1:09:34] drdrozd12: thats not too bad, thats doable with a full time job. if u good at the game
[1:10:43] Guffels: @micro1877 nah it would just be 4 meta specs and 1 off spec in every key
[1:10:48] SevzyYEP: @micro1877 boosting community would go bat shit crazy for that KEKW
[1:10:53] Guffels: people would cheese the shit out of it
[1:11:25] ShwoogityWoogity: not spec specific because being a 3k dev evoker is nothing to brag about
[1:12:20] ajax_shank: 6 raiders from ajax_shank have joined! 
[1:13:02] kuntoilija: but you can be a elite druid
[1:13:04] kuntoilija: :)
[1:13:09] SevzyYEP: Solo shuffle is spec specific but that's a meme mode
[1:13:22] Guffels: also less cheese-able
[1:13:24] kuntoilija: we need solo shuffle for m+
[1:13:24] ShwoogityWoogity: unless you're a mage
[1:13:44] matteo_dy: !commands
[1:13:46] Guffels: we could do spec specific if there was a queue for m+ which im actually down for just on the first thought
[1:14:59] Rypick: Well now that you have some down time can you explain your dps on when your using kitty and when your using starfire I see you use both
[1:15:06] SevzyYEP: You seemed pretty miserable last raid, massive time waste raid
[1:15:27] simplepathjg: thats just tindral
[1:16:01] GlaivedHam: how are people playing with the servers down?
[1:16:07] Waradin24: jb you got any tips for healing the 2nd/3rd boss in EB? I'm sort of struggling around the 24-25 level if people aren't standing in my efflo lol
[1:16:16] simplepathjg: KEKW
[1:16:19] matteo_dy: !threatplates
[1:16:21] GlaivedHam: LOL fair
[1:16:21] Cshtv: no america is the world
[1:16:23] Siraeyou: lies
[1:16:32] Cshtv: what the fuck is a kilometer
[1:16:33] LegendofEnigma: yeaa Canada!
[1:16:50] drdrozd12: according to every alien invasion move, there is only murica
[1:16:57] Guffels: feel bad for oce just trying to enjoy their life and servers are never up lol
[1:17:38] Kemplore: Will we ever see Jdottank for fun?
[1:17:52] SevzyYEP: @Kemplore Have you seen this guy questing as bear?
[1:17:57] caradea_: @Cshtv The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit mâ‹…sâˆ’1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency Î”Î½Cs.
[1:18:01] caradea_: got you covered
[1:18:16] caradea_: x100 this and you got a kilometer
[1:18:20] caradea_: *x1000
[1:18:49] ShwoogityWoogity: the fun wasn't for you
[1:18:51] Guffels: next season when bear gets their busted tier set back
[1:19:05] Cynastora1868: Join the darkside and play Aug
[1:19:20] SevzyYEP: JB playing aug and shot calling Kreygasm
[1:19:24] Hiea: you get annoyed at the tank/dps not doing their job
[1:19:49] Guffels: yeah my characters are all one spec per patch for that same reason
[1:20:58] LegendofEnigma: having to work on Weakauras just to change spec is the worst
[1:21:19] rooneycs: i would rather play angry birds 24/7 than playing an aug
[1:21:20] maneatingpotato1: maneatingpotato1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Started as a resto and now Im a boomkin.  Villain arc.
[1:21:28] maenkins: i've heard so many people would rather quit the game than play aug
[1:21:36] SevzyYEP: @jdotb get aug ready for next season when druid spot is taken by bear again pepeLaugh
[1:21:52] maneatingpotato1: Yes!!
[1:22:05] Hiea: you can deplete his key
[1:22:25] maenkins: EZ reroll it into a throne

[1:25:22] SevzyYEP: You should become a world of tanks main, I've become addicted to that shit
[1:26:14] xcvxcvxcvxcvxcvxcv: @sevzyyep im a veteran of WoT  are you send me a challenge?

[1:31:32] dragona92: It's elvui frames and he did it there
[1:32:45] Carmhealz: ow
[1:33:28] Tamis2Hamis: blasted
[1:37:39] simplepathjg: death zone
[1:40:09] plebss: u're gonna double drake without bl ?
[1:41:41] godenstag: this dg for healers is so stupid.. when i'm tanking it's so smooth haha
[1:41:57] Tamis2Hamis: uh oh
[1:42:41] Tamis2Hamis: good recovery
[1:43:42] phataus22: @plebss double drake w/o bl is def doable as rdruid. i do it all the time...but then again ive only timed a 28 lol. 29s/30s prob a diff story tbh
[1:43:49] kwazzeettv: did you vote for your tier? if so, which one?
[1:46:24] Oranssi_: @kwazzeettv look maximum video about it, Jb is in it for all healers
[1:46:53] plebss: did it in 28 as disco also
[1:46:57] plebss: dunno about 29 like usay
[1:46:59] zuerco: !wa
[1:47:03] plebss: scaling can be huge
[1:49:40] Tamis2Hamis: running and gunning
[1:51:04] Guffels: just gotta heal chromie now. 3 melds has a really good chance of not even dealing with the eruption
[1:55:11] Tamis2Hamis: what mod or weakaura shows iridikron's final timer or tindral's supernova?
[1:55:15] Raszbalol: 29 is a bit scary but 30 is insane
[1:55:19] Raszbalol: chronoburst u need big defensive
[1:55:25] Raszbalol: on 2nd boss area

[2:11:36] s_dawg1: Whats the last boss tech?
[2:11:54] theBroHam: some nonsense with taunting and melding the volley
[2:11:58] Svesno: rdruid difficult to learn comapred to other healers?
[2:12:31] theBroHam: kitty weaving is hard for me to pick up
[2:12:53] wadexxxwilson: I always say it's not hard to learn but it's a bit difficult to master...if that makes sense
[2:13:05] misterworldhide: the resto druids in lfg manage to get into low twenties spamming regrowth, so id say its pretty simple to learn
[2:13:19] Guffels: I always stay away from druid because I cant stand playing the class half way and it feels that cat weave is so much of the class mastery
[2:15:17] xxjameskingxx71: if you want early onset carpal tunnel resto druid is fun
[2:15:52] buttsauced: The problem with resto druid in low 20s isn't spamming regrowth, it's that pug dps don't know how to use defensives or cc/int properly and you can't save everyone with the way the HoTs work when its consistent unexpected damage.
[2:16:28] Simkha: Does it cause the boss to restart the cast?
[2:16:33] treavorthenusance: @xxjameskingxx71 just gotta use lower weight keys. that cured my wrist issues that i had like 5 years ago playing mage

[2:50:15] jdotb: !wt
[2:50:15] StreamElements: if you use ElvUI use this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/elvui-windtools | if no ElvUI use this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wind-dungeon-helper
[2:51:23] spoon_rl: Thoughts on the sand gauntlet after double dragon in the key?
[2:53:49] simplepathjg: i like the shield from miniboss for maiden
[2:54:47] spoon_rl: Yea that chronoburst slaps so hard
[2:54:51] hipposlam: theres so many casts tho. pally tank would help a lot of the interupts
[2:55:50] spoon_rl: When i play prot warrior dealing with the bleeds and magic damage is difficult
[2:56:32] asphyxiiaTV: as a new WoW in general player, as in 3 months type of new, would you recommend SoD? or should i stick with retail?
[2:57:02] nemzky: @asphyxiiaTV you can play both
[2:57:34] ren0m: SoD is more casual friendly imo and there's much less to do. It's for people who play 1h/day and won't fall behind.

[2:57:39] ottomr1990: retail is very end-game focused. classic is much more about playing through the journey and character development and whatnot
[2:58:11] asphyxiiaTV: i see, thanks guys!! big fan btw jdot! love ya brotha!
[2:58:15] ren0m: Retail is competitive, Classic is RP-like; probably the simplest way to explain it
[2:58:18] nemzky: @ottomr1990 not really as true with SoD, since "endgame" is only level 25 currently
[2:58:36] asphyxiiaTV: @nemzky does cap go up on the 8th of feb?
[2:58:47] ren0m: Yes, to 40
[2:58:48] nemzky: @nemzky yes cap goes up to 40
[2:59:02] asphyxiiaTV: big jump, sounds like fun!
[2:59:58] nemzky: SoD is definitely the easiest version of wow to play casually. Since even if you only play an hour a day you can easily get max level and be competitive at "end game" but thats mainly because there isnt a lot to do
[2:59:59] Guffels: SOD is 20-30 hours of leveling then 30 minutes of raid logging every 3 days]
[3:00:17] dilweed88: @Guffels yeah I came back to retail for that very reason
[3:00:27] dilweed88: @Guffels didn't want to endlessly grind WSG or farm gold for next phase
[3:00:35] asphyxiiaTV: @nemzky i mean apart from DG runs, whats there for endgame on SoD as of the moment? sorry i really get caught up in work LOL
[3:00:39] dilweed88: @Guffels was fun the first few weeks, but...
[3:00:48] dilweed88: @asphyxiiaTV BFD, that's it
[3:00:56] dilweed88: @asphyxiiaTV 3 day lockout
[3:01:05] ren0m: PvP but it's plagued with premades, so it's not an option
[3:01:20] nemzky: @nemzky they add a new raid at every "max level" with new loot, new pvp areas and new crated items, and of course the runes
[3:01:34] nemzky: crafted*
[3:01:36] asphyxiiaTV: @ren0m not really a pvp player too sooo
[3:01:57] ren0m: @asphyxiiaTV So you have BFD every three days and farming gold :P
[3:01:58] asphyxiiaTV: @dilweed88 literally just deeps??
[3:02:02] dilweed88: yep
[3:02:08] ren0m: It's extremely casual friendly
[3:02:09] nemzky: its completely different from the dungeon
[3:02:15] dilweed88: that's the only end game. either BFD or spam WSG
[3:02:16] ren0m: I'm moving back to retail because of it
[3:02:20] nemzky: new bosses, mechanics the only thing the same is the layout
[3:02:22] dilweed88: sure, it'd a 7 (8?) boss raid
[3:02:24] asphyxiiaTV: feb 8 better come quick man, only BFD is NOT it LOL
[3:02:25] dilweed88: but it takes 30 mins
[3:02:40] ren0m: After Feb 8 it'll be gnomer every three days
[3:02:43] dilweed88: and that's literally all you can do unless you're nostalgically addicted
[3:03:05] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[3:03:06] ren0m: They need to find a way to add +M-like system to Classic
[3:03:12] asphyxiiaTV: what a cliffhanger huh, so i guess only option is if u wanna play classic is HC
[3:03:13] dilweed88: or want to farm WSG endlessly
[3:03:14] nemzky: exactly, which is why its a perfect micro version of wow to play along side retail
[3:03:16] dilweed88: @ren0m that'd be interesting
[3:03:17] Guffels: and some gear from bfd is probably still gunna be bis next tier too. sod cant be the only game you play but its great for people who wanna fill a few hours
[3:03:22] asphyxiiaTV: @ren0m 100% agree
[3:03:38] ren0m: That would make the game 10x more enjoyable
[3:03:57] nemzky: they did that in wrath, they added beta/alpha/gamma dungeons that had affixes and better loot
[3:04:02] ren0m: Granted there aren't many mechanics to do in Classic dungeons. So you take 5 mages and you're set :P
[3:04:04] dilweed88: !armory
[3:04:04] StreamElements: Located under the stream
[3:04:07] asphyxiiaTV: oh chat, when does TWW release?
[3:04:15] Guffels: probably something they would look at for level 60
[3:04:16] ren0m: Summer I think
[3:04:23] ren0m: 2024 Summer
[3:04:25] dilweed88: @StreamElements is it though...
[3:04:28] asphyxiiaTV: like april? july?
[3:04:35] ren0m: No idea
[3:04:42] ren0m: If I had to guess
[3:04:44] ren0m: Early September
[3:04:44] Guffels: blizzard said fall at blizzcon the summer in the road map so??
[3:05:01] asphyxiiaTV: but we know blizz tho
[3:05:02] caradea_: september seems likely yes
[3:05:09] Guffels: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24046540/world-of-warcraft-in-2024-the-road-ahead
[3:05:20] asphyxiiaTV: september sounds great LOL my birth month
[3:05:40] ren0m: First we need to see what the skeleton on 10.2.6 means
[3:05:43] Guffels: im guesing mid august. they wanna get back to the legion release timeline
[3:06:11] kelly_mac06: @ren0m we all fucking die and go back to the shadowlands, then quit playing until 11.0
[3:06:24] ren0m: Whole wow turns to HC? Maybe?
[3:06:33] caradea_: aug is removed from the game
[3:06:38] P0llux_TV: isnt WoW down right now?
[3:06:43] Guffels: !eu
[3:06:43] StreamElements: JB re-rolled on EU servers Nov 2020 so he can be a daytime streamer and spend more time with the kids and !bb. Server: Tarren Mill-Horde. Guild: <Infinite> Ping: ~115ms. jdotbComfy

[3:06:57] P0llux_TV: rip
[3:07:06] asphyxiiaTV: seeing as TWW is near autumn, prolly sept is the right guess
[3:07:24] ren0m: And beta in April?
[3:07:32] ren0m: Streaming beta is not allowed right?
[3:07:39] ren0m: Or is it
[3:07:40] kelly_mac06: lol ofc it it
[3:07:45] kelly_mac06: *is
[3:07:48] ren0m: Ah nice

[3:08:21] ren0m: Fair enough
[3:08:23] Guffels: or alteast guarantees ity
[3:08:50] asphyxiiaTV: is wotlk classic even relevant as of now? thoughts?
[3:09:05] ren0m: I don't think so
[3:09:46] ren0m: I guess there's not much to do there either
[3:09:47] misterworldhide: same throne from 2 hours ago when you said that xD
[3:10:03] Guffels: all versions of wow are relevant till the next update for one of the other versions. wotlk is relevant for about 6 more hours lol

[3:25:47] Aroty: PVP has solo queue now at least
[3:26:00] Guffels: having a kid and playing wow has been a wild experience. i get about 1 character 4 raid hours and 8 keys per week
[3:26:12] WardWoW: NA misses u jeb
[3:26:15] aemithil: @jdotb yea i see what you mean cause i miss playing with my guild honestly but due to my job i found 2 years ago and having 2 kids in the last 3 years i dont have the time to raid and do m+ anymore with said guildies so guess the situation is simmiliar
[3:26:30] kevinsk8er: its weird that they merge oce with na? isnt that way more ping than eu?
[3:26:45] dilweed88: @Guffels I hear ya man. I have 2 kids under 2 and work ft and it's insane
[3:26:47] Guffels: i dont even care about the character, I wish you didnt have to pay the price and sub for both
[3:26:50] ottomr1990: i'd like to see the reason behind not having merged regions.  we already have like oceanic playing on NA with ping.  and tournament realms already being that way yeah
[3:27:05] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:27:18] inspirox: language barriers would be interesting, na already has the br crew doin their thing
[3:27:22] Shkafche: So theres no option to have 2 accounts eu/na ?
[3:27:39] aemithil: i would love to play with na ppl to do as a european they jsut seem so much chiller inside keys
[3:27:54] Guffels: dont forget worse lol. we have ragnaros
[3:28:22] Shkafche: Yeah more like that , not feasible to keep 2 of the same ?
[3:28:26] aemithil: @jodtb GL AND WATCH THE BAIT ON 1st boss
[3:28:39] ottomr1990: @inspirox yeah i think you'd have like a natural separation of regions still for play time reasons or language reasons. but it shouldn't have to be forced separation
[3:29:35] inspirox: are na people more chill in keys? anyone play both? i'm na and we do have some toxic keys

[3:31:24] nixar1: @frogishly cringe
[3:31:31] frogishly: cry
[3:31:56] inspirox: being from na i'd rather play eu, yall seem to have pugs in the 28-29 region most the day and way more players. na the only time there's 28/29 pugs is peak evening and its 1-2 keys at most
[3:32:21] aemithil: i think the european players jsut tilt quicker @frogishly
[3:32:28] aemithil: just
[3:32:34] frogishly: much quicker, yeah
[3:32:47] frogishly: @inspirox region doesn't matter
[3:32:48] eyeoin: @inspirox It is peak evening right now in EU, this is why
[3:33:06] kuntoilija: tell them only that m+ is dead after dragonflight season 1, and that world of warcraft, died with it.
[3:33:17] inspirox: i understand that but regardless top 100 na keys are still maybe 800-1k world, so much more volume

[3:37:12] ah_ah_aaaaah: Which M+ boss is the hardest to heal?

[3:40:14] inspirox: i wonder why they dont do the legion xavius strat of max ranging every mechanic
[3:41:54] inspirox: guess so, classes were a lot more tanky with prydaz and shit
[3:41:54] ah_ah_aaaaah: @inspirox for some reason timeways seems to be the only boss this patch that most pugs just don't know how to do

[3:54:14] TBouse: what would you have done if s3 rdruid didnt win
[3:54:14] reaperplaysx: ^
[3:54:30] flutey_: it was also melee meta
[3:54:50] inspirox: yeah i mean they just did damage so much easier than other healers and never oom'd
[3:54:56] reaperplaysx: when is season 4 coming?
[3:55:07] reaperplaysx: ah i see
[3:55:09] ottomr1990: no date yet other than "spring"
[3:55:14] inspirox: i really liked season 1 rdru, your hots actually did something
[3:55:16] plbbunny: are we halfway through the season yet?
[3:55:24] kelly_mac06: sometime between march and june!
[3:55:27] inspirox: wild growth felt fast as hell and flourish was godly
[3:55:30] kelly_mac06: hopefully later
[3:55:41] kelly_mac06: like June so we get a very short fated bullshit season
[3:55:43] kelly_mac06: that's my hope
[3:56:12] TBouse: doesnt it still own but we now have stuff that owns more
[3:56:14] INKkni: I'm getting into 20+ with PUG groups. Any tips or thoughts on what is hardest about pug Mythic +? Resto Druid
[3:56:34] iudico13: What is the small red part of your castbar? I have seen it on a lot of people but never understood it
[3:56:51] sevenhour: what do you think will be meta for mdi ??
[3:57:08] luxumbra69: @iudico13 SQW indicator
[3:57:09] plbbunny: probably MW dam/shields

[3:58:05] luxumbra69: you can essentially queue up your next spell when the bar hits the red and it won't cancel your current spell.
[3:58:12] TBouse: the elusive 28 throne
[3:58:42] TheSiliconDon: Is the owlweaving due to storming?
[3:58:53] iudico13: iudico13 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:59:07] luxumbra69: your entire group is capped at 8 targets lol
[3:59:09] TBouse: all aoe capped KEKL
[3:59:17] inspirox: enhance outlaw yall are hard target capped
[4:00:18] sheckles: why are you only tracking 1 monk defensive jb?
[4:00:25] RemwayTV: ravagers give me an aneurism when the dps stack up
[4:01:05] sheckles: oh ok
[4:01:10] sheckles: kinda makes sense
[4:01:18] luxumbra69: i thought karma could prevent debuff application?
[4:01:33] RemwayTV: @luxumbra69 prevent or remove
[4:02:00] ottomr1990: karma does neither
[4:02:07] ottomr1990: diffuse will remove one. sometimes
[4:02:16] luxumbra69: ah, ty.
[4:02:20] ICantPauseItMom: all karma does is give you an absorb for 50% of ur health and reflect the damage you take back to the target
[4:02:38] Guffels: this tier could have been so much more chill if they hadnt crushed sporecloak
[4:02:45] RemwayTV: hold up why does that take me like 100 regrowths and I just saw 2 and done >.>
[4:02:51] ottomr1990: also if they actually tuned anything after week 2

[4:04:05] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[4:04:23] luxumbra69: you entire group just whiffed kicks before you died lmao
[4:04:26] luxumbra69: yikes.
[4:04:27] Ronaldlovecraft: No clue how you can give up kick. I feel like my keys would be so much harder if i didnt have it
[4:05:05] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:05:15] luxumbra69: @Ronaldlovecraft they have infinite stops in this group
[4:05:43] Ronaldlovecraft: things still getting off, thats what killed him
[4:05:44] Guffels: @Ronaldlovecraft at the level he plays, his kick is never priority. being the 5th kick almost never matters when people know what the first 4 kicks have to be every pull
[4:05:46] LuffyOnePieceStrawhat: LuffyOnePieceStrawhat subscribed with Prime. 
[4:06:07] luxumbra69: @Ronaldlovecraft yeah, well, at this level your build is determined by comp. can't help it when DPS whiff their kicks.
[4:06:16] luxumbra69: yes you can
[4:06:34] luxumbra69: if ur group fights in doorway, the dps can line every single one.
[4:06:35] ottomr1990: yeah i always tank that thing on the corner or the doorway. it's so chill
[4:07:06] Svesno: I think blizz has removed Coagulated Genesaur Blood trink from EB loot table
[4:07:46] kuntoilija: i think so too
[4:07:46] Guffels: i kept forgetting to swap loot spec and got 3 leafs before a warlock traded me blood
[4:07:57] kuntoilija: yikes

[4:08:32] inspirox: tanks getting one shot a lot today
[4:08:43] TBouse: thoughts on these talents for throne/crushing depths: https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/restoration/DAQQVERRQYIiBQUFxBBBEOVURVFQFRhVUFQUDVEE
[4:08:45] nixar1: @Svesno you just have to commit, sell your soul. I got voodoo totem after 40atal runs
[4:08:46] inspirox: i guess that was 2 shot
[4:08:59] luxumbra69: @nixar1 people intentionally loot that trinket? lmao
[4:09:03] Fortearmure: hey jb
[4:09:20] nixar1: @luxumbra69 good for priests
[4:09:30] nixar1: in some cases
[4:09:37] Guffels: so nice of blizzard to let you do side content like running dungeons between the real game, searcing for key groups
[4:09:40] kuntoilija: i wanna play hpal, is it any good in keys?
[4:09:47] Svesno: @luxumbra69 Decent trink fro THrone runs
[4:09:56] nixar1: @Svesno yep
[4:09:59] theburgerking8: I really like totem in Waycrest, just plop it on etch or soulthorn target and forget them
[4:10:01] Guffels: @kuntoilija everything can do 27s if you are good
[4:10:07] TerdCSGO: jb i saw you at blizzcon but was scared to talk to you, too good looking
[4:10:16] TerdCSGO: you were radiant
[4:10:29] kuntoilija: ellesmere doesnt think so though
[4:10:31] INKkni: Have you tried Tree over Convoke for those big heals?
[4:11:44] inspirox: we run 29s with hpala, its a safe brez to have with dh tank and honestly the dmg is good
[4:11:53] TBouse: thoughts on these talents for throne/crushing depths: https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/restoration/DAQQVERRQYIiBQUFxBBBEOVURVFQFRhVUFQUDVEE
[4:12:13] justbeachi: how does a disc priest deal with crushing depths? seems like short answer is, they don't lol
[4:12:18] zashar_: Mana issues and lack of throughput makes a little harder to push on a paladin, but you can do most keys
[4:12:19] ICantPauseItMom: Any spec can do the vast majority of key levels
[4:12:47] Svesno: @justbeachi trinkets, pain sup, flash heal
[4:13:09] TBouse: seems like one of very few situations where improved regrowth is good
[4:13:16] zashar_: The mana is what infuriates me the most, how come some classes dont even think about mana, while paladin feels like an  alcoholic
[4:13:18] Mattyuh: im like 3340 io on hpal and its not as easy as my other healers
[4:13:30] Guffels: pres evoker is currently the least accomplished healer as they dont have any 30s
[4:14:07] TBouse: oh you run 1 harmonious nvm
[4:14:22] inspirox: is throne maybe an incarn key?
[4:14:38] Guffels: doubt you have jb but did you see tettles vid on a bunch of TW players getting banned?
[4:14:50] Guffels: rumor is RMT mythic raid and pilots
[4:14:59] TBouse: incarn feels so bad in throne except for the last hallway, but might be the play
[4:15:05] dikgesneden: yolo
[4:15:44] Guffels: so many of the top TW players havent done any keys in the last 5 days
[4:16:32] Guffels: yeah like logging 9 mythic clears in the same day with 1 person different in each raid

[4:18:25] luxumbra69: @Guffels dayum. wonder what kinda income they can get out of that because that is wild.
[4:18:51] luxumbra69: 9 mythic clears in a day is NUTS.
[4:19:10] misterworldhide: i think CE boost is like $2600 :|
[4:21:19] kuntoilija: yeah wanna start doing ce boosts?
[4:21:22] kuntoilija: screw streaming
[4:21:28] caradea_: and you only need a couple hundred people per region willing to buy that
[4:21:36] caradea_: and those guys exist
[4:21:39] maenkins: @misterworldhide thats roughly $56k a year HUH
[4:22:11] ren0m: Do MDI pros get paid all year round?
[4:22:13] ren0m: From the orgs
[4:23:05] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[4:23:12] treavorthenusance: 2600 bucks for a boost. good lord thats alot of money for a feat of strength
[4:23:12] ren0m: So there is no way to go full time pro in WoW, without streaming, unless you win big events once they happen?
[4:23:51] fusion2102: nnoggie said when he left echo there raid roster gets a fixed 500 EUR / month ....
[4:24:00] luxumbra69: @ren0m look at all the big winners-- they all stream.
[4:24:01] Britstream: how you gonna make 30-50k per person a year BegWan
[4:24:05] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:24:48] MightyGIGACHAD: @jdotb what's your setup for healing through a sentinel debuff absorb?
[4:24:58] ren0m: So you basically have to win everything
[4:25:00] Britstream: work in a shop and guarantee better than esport money
[4:25:04] ren0m: @luxumbra69 that's my point
[4:25:53] ICantPauseItMom: @jdotb Do you think it would be omega troll to run nourish in M+ instead of trees? from a pure HPS pov
[4:26:14] DoctorZeze: orgs are moving out but game is improving r..r..right?
[4:26:57] MightyGIGACHAD: All you can do is just spam regrowth as far as casting throughput yea?
[4:27:05] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:27:07] caradea_: it needs to be a good experience as a viewer
[4:27:07] ren0m: It's tough to have WoW esports running all year. I don't think it's possible to set up seasons around +Ms
[4:27:09] caradea_: not player
[4:27:40] ren0m: And that, it's tough to follow for people who don't play WoW, unlike LoL, CS..
[4:27:48] treavorthenusance: @StreamElements spam regrowth yea but rip a wild growth after throwing hots and then flourish
[4:27:54] Naowh: 1712 raiders from Naowh have joined! 
[4:27:58] s_dawg1: Some people just hate anyone that pushes above 3000 IO too. And they are dumb
[4:27:59] caradea_: @ren0m yeah you understand CS after watching for 10 minutes
[4:28:10] tom2012euloljkeu: Pog
[4:28:11] luxumbra69: @jdotb what do you think should be done with seasonal affixes moving forward? should they replace all other affixes?
[4:28:32] ren0m: Watching AWC as a non-WoW player is difficult. Everything is flashing and you have no idea what's going on.
[4:28:33] ICantPauseItMom: Do you think it would be omega troll to run nourish in M+ instead of trees? from a pure HPS pov
[4:28:38] bluriegg: BASED
[4:28:46] yctnm: BASED
[4:28:53] treavorthenusance: M+ = RAWTHROUGHPUT SEASON
[4:28:54] ottomr1990: @ren0m hell even watching it as a wow player that doesn't pvp is impossible to follow lol
[4:28:57] Aroty: Man, the affixes always feel bad for a healer too
[4:29:02] dikgesneden: we get different dungeons each season anyway
[4:29:02] Tippolski: keep preaching no affix JB
[4:29:05] Tippolski: we need this
[4:29:11] Starcillo: ppl are gonna do 40s and we all will die
[4:29:16] kuntoilija: @ICantPauseItMom look at your 2pc bonus
[4:29:18] fusion2102: YES NO affix pls
[4:29:19] ren0m: @ottomr1990 True that
[4:29:22] Skyfall715: not even fort/tyran?
[4:29:24] wolfshime: Agreed - if theyre rotating dungeons every season then affixes arent necessary
[4:29:27] inspirox: its kind of annoying when there's 2 push weeks where i'd have to take work off for a massively easier title grind
[4:29:28] Chaseton: Afflicted and Incorp made me take a break. At this point I want Explosive back
[4:29:28] misterworldhide: just turn m+ into something more akin to TGP and then it naturally esportifies the game and gives a better viewer experience with everyone always pushing harder
[4:29:32] rodeojones31: only seasonals
[4:29:35] Tippolski: no affix = big cranker pulls and higher keys in infinite scaling content. Let's just witness it
[4:29:37] rodeojones31: no other affixes
[4:29:42] luxumbra69: IMO- they wanna keep it fresh, give us a single well recieved past seasonal.
[4:29:44] Aroty: Fort Tyrant only would be cool actually
[4:29:46] nixar1: what would you consider as a success?
[4:29:51] LifeofSlayer77: u mean no fort nd tyran too or?
[4:30:00] Mattyuh: id rather just play a harder mythic without shit like afflicted, spites
[4:30:02] kevinhag: fort/tyran + seasonal affix
[4:30:02] ItsYent: people dont usually deplete due to affixes its just the scaling so idk why they wouldnt try no affix
[4:30:04] ren0m: @misterworldhide It's still not as enjoyable to watch as other big esports titles. Probably because it's tougher to understand what's going on.
[4:30:06] bscheur: everybody's favorite weeks are the weeks when affixes matter the least
[4:30:12] treavorthenusance: or make fort only affect certian packs each week and make em beefy
[4:30:14] dikgesneden: random affixes on key start
[4:30:17] ren0m: The "oh fuck" moments aren't that noticeable in WoW
[4:30:24] Brisklet: I'd like to see no affix and ladders/io score to be based on the speed of a +20. +20 would be the highest possible key
[4:30:34] Oracle_WoW: would be boring without fort and tyran
[4:30:40] Naowh: they should make an ew affix
[4:30:42] Nydiot: why not make both sweaty at the same time and no affixes
[4:30:46] luxumbra69: What if fort/tyr only affected HP, not damage? Make it so we fight timer not 1 shots.
[4:30:46] Naowh: if u miss your kick u get -20 score
[4:30:58] Tippolski: @Naowh this +100
[4:31:05] treavorthenusance: @Naowh all dps below 24 have lost 1000 io in one week
[4:31:06] RoninChau: They should do like challenge mode and modifiying the % of dmg like now depending on level \o/
[4:31:09] Naowh: if u die with personal up u get -30 score
[4:31:11] justbeachi: what do you think of next weeks affixes? afflicted bolstering tyran
[4:31:32] battleskaar: @luxumbra69 this would be so boring for a healer theyd have no benefit to group other than who can do most dmg
[4:31:35] inspirox: LOL
[4:31:41] Piaggio: scores of players going below 0 io
[4:31:42] theBroHam: allowing score to go down would be interesting. Wonder what it would do for group accountability, toxicity etc.
[4:31:43] luxumbra69: @Naowh if i die with personal, the healer gets -30 score
[4:32:00] ottomr1990: @luxumbra69 or similarly just make it so damage scales different from health, or like stops scaling at +20 (but health keeps going up)
[4:32:15] Britstream: BegWan
[4:32:19] inspirox: robin got the aug treatment where augs miss kicks because even at 3600 they're really about 3k
[4:32:22] ItsYent: basically getting the sloppy seconds
[4:32:41] LifeofSlayer77: KEKW
[4:32:42] Razzeu: EZ
[4:32:51] treavorthenusance: jb giving those 3am U UP wow txt
[4:32:55] monochromator: Mythic+ flirting Pog
[4:33:01] zebbzo91: they should ad a + score seasson on how mutch u helped the m+ team. lets say. a +20 u get 10 points. for every taunt. interrupt. bop. spellwarden etc. u get +1 point for eatch help to the grp. that would benefit more to ppl actually doing their class if they think about raiting..
[4:33:04] adamantium_bear: do you pug keys?
[4:33:05] zashar_: I heard Nerf is looking for a new healer XD
[4:33:38] TBouse: lol jb you deserve a group but that's a bit of COPIUM LOL
[4:33:54] luxumbra69: I'd like to see an in-game YELP system. would remove toxicity i think.
[4:34:00] adamantium_bear: wowwee you got this high puggin?
[4:34:01] gnarrizard: pug 4 lyfe

[4:34:06] Piaggio: jb the one night stand healer
[4:34:07] s_dawg1: You know the saying JB, "Happy healer happy life"
[4:34:07] gwildorr_: is it worth finding those people who are just almost at your level.. and working with them to raise them into the new diamond in the rough -- or worth only to play with S tier gamers?
[4:34:19] inspirox: the one night stand healer that's fuckin gold
[4:34:58] treavorthenusance: @gwildorr_ depends how hot their moms are
[4:35:12] Tabsalot: LUL
[4:35:18] spiffysauce1: i really need to start adding deep breath pulls into my routes
[4:35:21] qyxiz: TYR SKIP ROUTE Pog
[4:35:24] Piaggio: the note actually refers to the ranged players in the group
[4:35:37] inspirox: depends on the io bracket, @gwildorr_ it also depends what their goals are
[4:35:47] Diabetelicious: Do the groups at least give you a warm courtesy towel after dropping you for their regular healer?
[4:36:04] luxumbra69: the first trash mob at the battlefield arena is secretly the hardest trash in this whole dungeon.
[4:36:13] adamantium_bear: ^
[4:36:13] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: whats that shit telling you to add and keep

[4:39:02] adamantium_bear: no one interrupted the add
[4:39:04] Piaggio: how do you die as mage
[4:39:17] ottomr1990: i forget can the orb hurt the mini bosses or just the little dudes?
[4:39:32] luxumbra69: @ottomr1990 just little ones.
[4:39:58] gwildorr_: mage AFK?
[4:40:04] gwildorr_: oh he was waiting lol
[4:40:10] luxumbra69: mage playing AUG spec today
[4:40:25] inspirox: thats a top 4 mage world...
[4:40:29] inspirox: sorry 40

[4:41:57] Entelligenz: i just played bad, no excuses haha
[4:42:04] justbeachi: are you surprised there hasn't been dungeon tuning? last tuning was in november... i think s1 and s2 had more frequent balancing
[4:42:05] inspirox: what do you think about keys dropping at deplete? like maybe the key stays 28 rise unless u complete on deplete
[4:42:18] Entelligenz: but i played keys for 10h all week i just really need to stop KEKW
[4:42:30] yctnm: two pairs Prayge
[4:42:33] luxumbra69: 28 rise with  2 24 sec kicks and a 1min kick? no way they're timing that lmaoooo

[4:44:00] VoxVornVoltair: Yo JB, whatever happened to Shakib? I used to watch your groups back in BfA
[4:44:29] gwildorr_: funny how EU you actually see keys that are 27+... on NA you dont see hardly any keys posted that high regularly
[4:44:53] inspirox: idk there's tons of 27s on na problem is no 29s :(
[4:45:10] ren0m: EU > NA confirmed?
[4:45:10] ItsYent: do you know the WA/Addon that tells u whos key it is when u zone into a key?
[4:45:25] inspirox: look how many they have jesus
[4:45:27] gwildorr_: i think 26/27 is like the pug limit.. way more fails when people aren't in coordinated groups/ discord etc for 28/29s+
[4:45:37] inspirox: hows eu ping jb? i kinda want to  make an eu toon
[4:45:40] Diabetelicious: I like dorki's m+ package because it gives me a cool meow right before I get absolutely piss missiled by a tankbuster

[4:46:22] adamantium_bear: @Diabetelicious I'm using that term from now on "piss missiled" glorious tbh
[4:46:44] ItsYent: it will say the key and level at the top of the screen i've seen it on other streamers stuff never thought to ask tho lol
[4:47:06] Diabetelicious: @adamantium_bear There's no other way to describe tott double fort shellbreaker when you're dry in defense tbh
[4:47:07] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: is a 26vs29 that big a difference?
[4:47:22] inspirox: massiiiive
[4:47:22] gwildorr_: @adamantium_bear i love getting piss missiled - its the new phrase for tanks
[4:47:36] caradea_: @gwildorr_ yeah... need 27s now and invites are much slower
[4:47:36] ottomr1990: @ItsYent dorki's WA site has it if you ever look there. it's called like "whos key is it" or something
[4:47:45] sheckles: i thought it was 10-12%
[4:47:49] ItsYent: @ottomr1990 i just saw it over there lol ty
[4:47:54] sheckles: like it scales harder after 20's doesnt it?
[4:48:12] VoxVornVoltair: oh is scaling not exponential? I thought it was a huge increase per key level
[4:48:29] hunterzx: and if you die, you dont' do next kick and someone else dies too
[4:48:33] MBG_95: the difference between 26-29 is the same difference between 20-26
[4:48:35] Diabetelicious: @ottomr1990 hearing the meow-equivalent of the THX intro from movies is honestly horrifying
[4:48:36] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: Yeah that is a pretty big dsifference now that you explain it
[4:49:06] theBroHam: @ottomr1990 my husband has that package and I thought our cats were dying
[4:49:13] inspirox: you need more dmg and you need to basically play perfect in upper 20s because missed kicks and such are just death
[4:49:22] gwildorr_: i just love pugs because everyone sends their interrupts on the 1st mob and people start getting one shot on other mobs.. glorious alt piss missiling deaths
[4:49:38] adamantium_bear: bro thatn phrase is so funnyyy
[4:50:11] RemwayTV: me and brh last boss earlier today prime example :O
[4:50:18] hunterzx: like archers in BRH
[4:50:20] xjacobtv: ETCH!
[4:50:21] inspirox: oakhearts a good example, every 30 seconds u need a 30% ish DR or its 1 shot
[4:50:26] hunterzx: suddenly their shoot oneshots
[4:50:48] inspirox: @hunterzx archers dont 1 shit in brh, even on 32 they do 800k
[4:50:59] ren0m: !talents
[4:51:52] Aroty: And ppl immediately blame the healer when they don't understand what personals are
[4:53:12] RemwayTV: theres a WA that does that but everyone in grp must have it - like it does an aoe stop list. i dont use it because I pug but im pretty sure it exists
[4:53:19] inspirox: so many ppl just watch high keys and think its just the same thing as 25-26 just more damage lol
[4:54:02] lucasag098: !
[4:54:19] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: I wish so much I had an interupt on my Druid like I did on my Shaman
[4:54:46] Lottinius: healer becomes cosmetic at high keys NOTED
[4:54:52] xjacobtv: @GirthControlPill You do have one if you want to take it :)
[4:55:01] Diabetelicious: Healers fake role in high keys confirmed?
[4:55:17] inspirox: so jb did u make a whole new acc for eu or did you somehow xfer yours to eu
[4:55:33] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: @xjacobtv they made it pretty bullshit to spec into though which sucks
[4:55:33] Karemabdual: witches WCM, is brutal 28+ with no help
[4:55:38] kelly_mac06: @inspirox you can't xfer to EU
[4:55:44] inspirox: gotcha
[4:55:56] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: I wish they would make a branch to skull bash from thick hide
[4:55:58] xjacobtv: @GirthControlPill I 100% agree, they should make the beam an option on the right side.
[4:56:05] yctnm: Do you prefer that to be the point of failure
[4:56:07] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: or beam yeah
[4:56:51] inspirox: the problem is its either a game of 1 shots that ppl hate then they make a bunch of rot damage you get season 1 meta of double or triple offhealers
[4:57:10] weezie_61: I heard you might be doin MDI with JPC? Any truth to that?
[4:57:17] ren0m: Is there an addon that allows you to have more macros?
[4:57:19] eph_eph: the main issue for me in high keys whether im tank heals or dps is that the dps dont CC/interrupt or use defensives and they are easy to blames healers or tank for pulls
[4:57:28] TBouse: prime key hours yet to come
[4:57:31] CrerisRs: @inspirox that is inevitable with infinite scaling, you will sooner or later just hit a limit of some sorts

[4:57:37] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: @ren0m macro toolkit does
[4:57:49] gwildorr_: @eph_eph 100%
[4:58:06] ren0m: @GirthControlPill Thank you
[4:58:59] zebbzo91: @eph_eph i try brh and first pull ppl only have done 1 interrupt frist pull and thats insane.
[4:59:03] inspirox: yeah like i've heard the only key that currently is a damage check is throne and i think that's pretty accurate
[4:59:19] xjacobtv: @inspirox Throne is an everything check fuck that place
[4:59:19] zebbzo91: @eph_eph and iim tank so yeah i know the problem.
[4:59:20] eph_eph: @zebbzo91 mhm thats how it goes
[4:59:29] Celissah: Would love if they changed m+ to be more fun every week and not just every 3rd because of easy affixes.
[4:59:32] TBouse: i think healers can stand out more in this type of season where you actually struggle to survive with regular pulls
[4:59:41] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: @ren0m note though that no mod allows more char specific, but the toolkit will give you a big window to put everything
[4:59:41] 9vice: 10.2.5 live yet?
[4:59:59] luxumbra69: @TBouse it isn't the healer making or breaking it though. It's defensive usage.
[5:00:08] luxumbra69: @9vice 5hr
[5:00:19] zebbzo91: i mean every big pull dpser should know how to use their cds.
[5:00:23] TBouse: healers absolutely can be the difference and can mitigate poor defensive usage to ap oint
[5:00:28] VoxVornVoltair: What kind of limitations do you think are more enjoyable for M+ then? Feels like this season has a ton of cast stop requirement as the big limit
[5:00:49] noewon: YEP healers just need to heal more.
[5:01:07] Lottinius: based
[5:01:10] oakeri: its a ret pally
[5:01:20] oakeri: he may have issues.
[5:01:23] LifeofSlayer77: KEKW
[5:01:25] oakeri: OMEGALUL
[5:01:27] gnarrizard: they dont miss kicks at least
[5:01:29] Celissah: "That's a easy in-time" -jdotb meanwhile last day dont you ever say that's a easy in-time (fall) D:
[5:01:29] shdowcraft: @eph_eph i mean at the end of the day, its just a communication issue. if its keys without voice obv its never gonna be perfect cc wise or defensive wise
[5:01:32] Starcillo: he thinks pvp is real
[5:01:35] shdowcraft: cause people will just overuse stuff etc
[5:01:40] nick08_wow: do you feel like if prot pally with all their interrupts and VDH with all their control lots of these keys would not be do able the way they are played (esspecially with no comms)? The trash is insane lately >27s
[5:01:44] ah_ah_aaaaah: I usually ask for proof of a 180kg deadlift befire I invite.

[5:07:45] inspirox: im about to convert to eu that's redic
[5:07:54] VoxVornVoltair: @nick08_wow VDH and Prot have it substantially easier because of the amount of trash control they have for sure. Other tanks cant keep stuff locked down for as long so they have to rely on their DPS more to kick/help
[5:08:12] Piaggio: Jebaited
[5:08:18] sly20193: @inspirox thats what i was thinking about doing too
[5:08:22] VoxVornVoltair: But the r1 of every tank is still doing 28s or higher
[5:08:36] inspirox: LOL
[5:08:52] sly20193: na you dont see 28s or 29s
[5:09:10] hairybacon2: i feel like EU is the place to be if you want to run keys and work from home lol

[5:11:08] VoxVornVoltair: JB what is your favorite non-meta tank to run with for keys this season?
[5:11:14] inspirox: what's worse for ppl who have played both servers? the BR on na or the RU on eu?
[5:11:48] hairybacon2: group finder flags addon, it helps you not play with those people
[5:11:49] kuntoilija: whats the meta tank

[5:12:13] shmmeker: KEKW

[5:35:15] luxumbra69: @inspirox if you stinger on a fort bursting, someone is dying. the dungeon has easier count elsewhere. there's no reason to do it.
[5:35:59] TBouse: no dragon deaths allowed
[5:36:03] cheataki: unless stinger dies 1rst
[5:36:15] jfonz199: @jdotb you ever coming back to NA?

[5:36:58] ottomr1990: then it's NA time
[5:36:59] inspirox: @luxumbra69 check the 30s they run stingers, they even pull stingers from sky down by first boss....
[5:37:07] TemptedRaven: Afternoon keys on NA are terrible
[5:37:13] TemptedRaven: mornings not so bad though
[5:37:21] luxumbra69: @inspirox right, but you dont have stings going out during unavoidable aoe damage.

[5:57:23] honorablecumulon: jb  how do tanks survive the bloom + frontal
[5:57:24] TBouse: it's another good ToL key
[5:57:54] luxumbra69: @honorablecumulon you prevent the bloom application, but ensuring you are full and have at least a small absorb before the cast goes off
[5:58:42] Galois_rg: you can also taunt meld the bloom as a nelf healer with a taunt
[5:58:44] JackBurton176: how do you force bloom on tank
[5:58:47] Braiboed: really?
[5:58:53] ottomr1990: wtf i didn't know that
[5:58:53] Rillyla: i dont think thats always true i play bdk and ive never avoided it with blood shield
[5:58:56] s_dawg1: Like the spiders in BRH?
[5:58:58] gunethersnuf: the anomaly will only cast untwist if the tank keeps running away too
[5:59:02] burne114: you can also taunt meld it but it's pretty degen
[5:59:03] TBouse: ive seen bloom hit for like 3m on application too, idk if that's a bug
[5:59:05] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:59:11] luxumbra69: @JackBurton176 have threat lol. it is highest threat targetted
[5:59:11] dithrica: wait as a lock can I pre-dark pact that then?
[5:59:24] GarlicSizzle: @Rillyla Bloodshield is for melee hits not dots
[5:59:25] RoodToob: @Rillyla blood shield is a phys only shield, bloom is magic
[5:59:25] CallMeTOG: @rillyla blood shield absorbs physical damage, bloom is magic
[5:59:25] s_dawg1: @gunethersnuf Nah untwist is just on a timeer
[5:59:29] luxumbra69: @AnySteph12 as a warlock you should be imp dispelling
[5:59:31] DixxyDix: hi what absorb should i use against bloom then as prot plat ?
[5:59:46] gunethersnuf: @s_dawg1 ya but it doesnt cast bloom is what im saying
[5:59:47] inspirox: everyone yoloing their keys before reset
[5:59:47] luxumbra69: @DixxyDix tyr enforcer can be timed
[5:59:54] shadowfold3: people queuing their keys cause it's reset tomorrow :P

[6:00:05] Galois_rg: just have any nelf with a taunt taunt meld the bloom, problem solved
[6:00:11] SparrowONE: Dinner time is over in EU now, so now we bring out the keys :D
[6:00:12] luxumbra69: @AnySteph12 RIP xD
[6:00:27] cKute: is this ptr?
[6:00:29] theBroHam: @baguvixop the only place I've seen it used is for the adds on Morchie
[6:00:46] luxumbra69: idk if pre DP prevents it on DPS, i just know tanks can prevent it from going on anyone.
[6:00:59] luxumbra69: @cKute live, EU server

[6:05:12] Spitako: part of the 10% GIGATON
[6:05:17] hucking: i've had many women tell me there is no such thing as too much chest hair and after they saw mine they agreed it was too much LUL
[6:05:18] guynormally: you are the 2% GIGATON
[6:05:23] Darkelment: do you run poison dispel for throne or yolo
[6:05:23] JackBurton176: I remember you complaining about aug messing up the dps tracker
[6:06:19] honnir: who needs aug ? GIGATON

[6:08:04] shmmeker: what happened to rise 28
[6:08:21] inspirox: that'
[6:08:32] burne114: @shmmeker timed it so fast we didnt even see the end
[6:08:35] sheckles: Clueless
[6:08:38] inspirox: that's a big time loss @luxumbra69 since you have to run back and do the droplets again
[6:08:43] shmmeker: ye just like i thought
[6:08:52] kuntoilija: timed so fast, morchie even dropped their manties
[6:08:58] shmmeker: timed before reach the last boss
[6:09:03] shmmeker: LUL
[6:09:37] inspirox: well your damage is a LOT higher in this 28 only 1 persons target capped
[6:09:57] luxumbra69: @inspirox droplets are less than 30 seconds. idk. and using lust on a boss that has totems is huge value always to prevent additional time loss.
[6:10:24] inspirox: @luxumbra69 you ignore them on fort...
[6:10:37] inspirox: least above 26
[6:11:06] inspirox: esp with dh tank
[6:12:07] clonemonk: No Aug evoker always confuses my brain when I see meters.

[7:20:49] Aimboater: you can for sure
[7:21:01] Aimboater: I feel like I barely have to heal vdh like bdk
[7:21:01] Whitewolf1441: sorry for noob question but is it normal to disband after one wipe?
[7:21:14] TBouse: ToL might be the play since there was just throughput issues
[7:21:15] tweed_13: @jsimx brings value.
[7:22:28] Amandalorian: @Whitewolf1441 depends on key i guess
[7:22:40] ottomr1990: @Whitewolf1441 depends on the key level and what you wiped on.  like if you wipe on a boss that you lusted some dungeons it's just GG go next because you're not making up those lost 3-4 minutes
[7:23:25] touchpanel12: incarn a must in this dungeon?
[7:23:27] TBouse: it's very good combined with verdant heart
[7:29:48] silverbulletzz: zero aug rdruid keys alrighty

[7:36:16] kngcoi: Do you just rhow down Hear of the Wild on CD?
[7:36:36] smurfidra: why are druids not using reju on m+?
[7:36:46] TBouse: jb i think you're onto something with frenzied regen in this key
[7:37:50] gogoshax: zero didn't and crew didn't make it
[7:45:28] Kaykonio: lmao
[7:45:59] ShulkN: Flip the role and watch him get banned instead of laughed at
[7:47:43] Whitewolf1441: close
[7:47:55] Whitewolf1441: im so invested now
[7:48:24] fabricio_cs2: fabricio_cs2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey JB
[7:48:27] Infectika: Hey guys been afk for like 14 mins, how many keys we gone thru since then
[7:48:56] visolaa: Man, I have a hard time keeping up time on catform when playing +20. Are there any advice on how to approach it?
[7:50:22] Dotctori: Cause that wasn't overall healing, for whatever reason even tho you selected it
[7:50:56] hellshifterd: Is rdruid leech or avoidance better for M+?
[7:51:06] smoothlol: so JB needs a THOT and Rise +28 correct?

[8:04:08] SmokeBud24Seven: So my vault is trash then Sadge
[8:05:05] SmokeBud24Seven: why the hell do they put somthing with +5% holy damage on a weapon that dont work in the invirement we play in
[8:05:08] SmokeBud24Seven: The infinite hand

[8:20:51] KaLYes: I think 28/29 is the cap of pug for most keys. AD you might be able to do at 30 but that is it
[8:21:18] KaLYes: I friend timed some 30s last season but he was in a grp with 2/3 prems
[8:21:22] KaLYes: GN
