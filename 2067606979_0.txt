[2:19:08] bluemagic212121: yeah thats why even with the tech, it didnt feel that faster
[2:19:15] Saqulatv: Why dont you just check the overall at the end of the dungeon?? :D
[2:19:57] GalacticosBIH: 33
[2:20:08] bingo_roswell: How did you guys lose to a 3 DPS team in Fall?

[2:22:02] Tysken81: they have the 5 sek penalty
[2:22:03] krona: why did gingi play night elf in every dungeon?
[2:22:07] Kraidyy: i think it comes down as soon as the last add is killed
[2:22:07] yujik46: its timer based for 1st adds but killing the 2 adds phases boss to 2nd no?
[2:22:34] quixef: no its not timer based, if you kill adds fast enough it does not even go up
[2:22:44] Elpapitank: LOWER BREQAKER SHAMELESS
[2:22:46] quixef: happend in a 20
[2:23:54] ahmmagad: you have more interupts, doesnt that tell us that your mobs are dying slower?

[2:25:19] Starrks: tobo is doing alot more interrupts for sure, maybe taking away from your dps becuase the dps has to do more
[2:25:59] rpgonlyforme: My guess on going right is that you don't lose time on lust with the transfers of the iris

[2:53:03] riotscream: the everbloom loss was sanguino healing
[2:53:04] rpgonlyforme: I really doubt it, until MDI is over or for season 4 ptr once 10.2.6 drops
[2:53:06] Croneux: I think he explained it twice. Sounded legit.
[2:53:13] Zaccin: Hey if he didn't get it all right that's cool
[2:53:20] mmshampanski: Sanguino?
[2:53:51] Zaccin: but meh, I'm sure the other teams will figure it out by... well the other group will have it by next weekend tbh
[2:54:02] StreamElements: Follow my Social Medias! Instagram.com/naowh | Twitter.com/naowhxd | Youtube.com/naowhgaming
[2:54:23] Zaccin: y'all will just have to figure out some new tech somewhere for globals, I have faith in the echo strat machine
[2:54:36] wakeandbacon95: KEKG
[2:55:36] Croneux: 1. 3 dps meld to drop aggro, go to battlefield to summon. 2. healer meld to drop aggro, go to morchie but let dots persist on riftmage. 3. tank has aggro from 2nd riftmage, melds to accept summon and go to battlefield. This brings riftmage to battlefield. 4. since healer dot was up on one riftmage, there is one on morchie side. healer kills it. 5. 2nd rift mage is killed in battlefield. 6. tank pops sigil on 3 mobs on battlefield, and takes portal to morchie before it does damage.
[2:55:42] Croneux: Am I... roughly right?
[2:55:50] Croneux: Jesus, there was likely something wrong there xD
[2:56:05] wakeandbacon95: damn
[2:56:08] zelcione: you think a 4th dps as ret is better than aug ?
[2:56:47] LeMike: lemiikeDAWGS
[2:57:18] rpgonlyforme: They beat the second add and you didn't.  So either sanguine or their comp is better dps
[2:57:29] hellopatrik: @LeMike naowhCreep
[2:57:49] LeMike: suup
[2:57:50] LeMike: GG WP
[2:58:07] gelens1: luckily

[2:58:12] AlsoZen: Please say it isn't so. Don't wanna hear Aug diff
[2:58:13] Croneux: Gotta say the RISE strat was the best piece of gaming content I've seen in a long time. Whole family was sitting with dropped jaws in living room and celebrating. Thank you for being fkin awesome <3
[2:58:31] bencur88: hello
[2:58:41] Zaccin: @Croneux Your whole family watches MDI? That's cool!
[2:59:27] Croneux: Yeah daughter is tanking her second season M+ now, wife and son are also getting more into it.
[2:59:28] AlsoZen: It was amazing, Robin. Grats again
[2:59:34] LGhost: didnt legendary use the portal too but not as efficiently?
[2:59:44] Croneux: Daughter learned how to play DH properly from @Naowh 's guide.
[3:00:22] Zaccin: @Croneux It's a good guide, my partner has been maining VDH since 8.2 and she learned a lot from it
[3:00:28] cleytonpa1: @Naowh , it was the sanguine that ended up healing the boss in eb?
[3:00:54] Croneux: She loved it last season as well, but something about the sigils just resonates with her. At 11 years old she's making dad proud tho
[3:00:58] mmshampanski: How do u think ur portal strat must be nerfed or its like clever use
[3:01:01] cleytonpa1: god that was so unlucky

[3:02:40] Croneux: One moment of greatness: BRH Smashspite. Dominator about to die on boss and drop sanguine. Zaelia goes Bear, taunts dominator to move it from boss and then it dies in a better spot. Quick microdecision that shows how insanely good this team is.
