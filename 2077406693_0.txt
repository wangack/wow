[1:22:38] dufflelul: isnt wrath dead
[1:22:57] moby_slick: RP Soniimedical in japanese, ez
[1:22:59] Monsowhs: I usually tell my students 15-30 minutes a day will take you a lot further than doing small bursts of studying intense
[1:23:08] pilgrim_1234: @azzy_dog omg multi lingual guys, right?
[1:24:09] macjcool: kanji is cursive?
[1:24:44] konexd: the romanization one
[1:24:49] Monsowhs: Shouldn't say this as a teacher but I think kanji is the least important part of the language these days
[1:25:50] Monsowhs: It burns many many hours so in a case where you can't spend hours every day studying it is tough
[1:25:53] pilgrim_1234: it's beautiful, though
[1:26:25] macjcool: more about willpower

[1:27:17] OlleverTV: Have you seen the xp buffs coming to SoD?

[1:29:51] TobyNova: i hit 36 few weeks ago and was like "shit i'm kinda old now" (my Dad died at 68 do going off that i'm half way through my life
[1:29:59] Nickxter: ngl, when I get to 40s or so probably will start with TRT, not only to keep me in shape but also for the health benefits
[1:30:00] zollicious14: i saw that video. they were hyping it up like 104 year old dude racing. then all the other seniors just DUSTED him

[1:30:47] azzy_dog: longevity is key
[1:30:54] nowheretoday: How long you wanna live?
[1:31:11] azzy_dog: moral of the story STRETCH
[1:31:11] kboyyyyy: yeah that would be fire
[1:31:14] darvent: TRT is treating a symptom not a condition (typically)
[1:31:22] azzy_dog: God damn I heard it all the time growing up but fr, just do it
[1:31:22] kboyyyyy: when did u start taking your health super super seriosuly?
[1:31:43] zollicious14: if you're under 40 and on trt, you likely didnt need it. rare cases sure
[1:31:53] TobyNova: Who knows though what the future holds, people are already looking for ways to reverse aging
[1:31:59] TobyNova: That will be wild
[1:32:16] miloxz: i think im gonna take my health very seriously when I start working again and I'll have the money to

[1:33:14] nowheretoday: How did you get metal poisoning tho
[1:33:18] zollicious14: i didnt believe in heavy metal detox. wife convinced me ot just try it. WORKS
[1:33:20] miloxz: you should consider writing about everything you do health wise, I'm sure it'd be a killer
[1:33:25] azzy_dog: stretch, go for runs, get some sun, you'll be fine
[1:33:29] marvinmc420: Why would you need money to take care of your health lol
[1:33:33] Nickxter: not speaking about lowering mercury levels, but placebo overall is one hell of a drug
[1:33:37] Aurra_90: you ever done a couple days fast to detox?
[1:33:44] 2drunk4this: wait your hair
[1:34:04] miloxz: I do all the exercise, I just want to improve the quality of food I buy along with taking essential supplements I find
[1:34:08] gwk_exclusive: @marvinmc420 eating all natural foods are typically higher priced. i think thats what he means
[1:34:22] nowheretoday: Wow
[1:34:25] marvinmc420: @gwk_exclusive so is going to the hospital for diabetes, etc LUL
[1:34:29] nowheretoday: That's a lot
[1:34:30] TobyNova: Yeh tbh the more i think about it, we could contemplate so much for years and it's probably just a waste of our most precious resource, which is time
[1:34:31] moby_slick: tuna is bis
[1:34:33] nakir21: white albacore is a good option
[1:34:35] Aurra_90: do you feel good after doing 24 hours? been curious about it
[1:34:35] miloxz: @gwk_exclusive yes, thats what I meant
[1:34:41] BroodingDoob: @miloxz don't really need supplements, food is key
[1:34:44] moby_slick: @nakir21 yup, albacore
[1:34:51] zollicious14: how long does your typical fast last?
[1:34:51] haileyxzx: i tried eating tuna but i just throw up the moment i smell it lol
[1:34:56] marvinmc420: You can find natural foods for low price in bulks , just gotta do some research
[1:34:57] zollicious14: i do a 30 hour fast once a week
[1:34:59] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: blue steel naow!
[1:34:59] Thugjoose: i have a rule for tuna, 1 day on 2 days off
[1:35:08] agibbs339: I love tuna
[1:35:12] pilgrim_1234: do you put fruit or cucumbers in water when you fast?
[1:35:15] luke_chalaire: you should do a LIT Halloween stream this year and hype up the cosplay you do. sounds small but could be fun yk
[1:35:20] Skrimij_: everyday of high school I ate tuna sandwiches and top ramen for lunch.. surprised I’m not dead
[1:35:23] ZhenMike: what triggered taking the blood test?

[1:35:56] nakir21: do you get your levels checked regularly?
[1:35:58] john57galt: Just can't trust where the fish is sourced. Red meat is the way.

[1:36:37] TobyNova: Talking about good health, gonna get some sleep, thanks for streaming earlier, was good to hang for a bit, catch you soon. Peas

[2:29:36] MrLockeyDD: Unless they put in titans fury it's a RIp for warriors
[2:29:39] Winttyrr: the most annoying this is every class has runes that give new abilities, and those rune abilities scale so hard.
[2:29:45] norxnz: LOL
[2:29:45] nowheretoday: They're gonna drop bladestrom
[2:29:48] miloxz: this mix goes hard, link?

[2:30:14] A5H0J: Not this sus stuff again NotLikeThis
[2:30:15] caudie1: lol rear glutes
[2:30:18] PeasantNoMore: I dont think warrs will get anything, the blizz is looking at them as OP in classic at 60 and they probably want all classes on par with eachother
[2:30:18] kyvcs: why are we in ulda
[2:30:19] MrLockeyDD: titans grip*

[2:34:56] Kusig: Shield Slam
[2:34:56] Littlol: no there is plenty of stuff in the game they coul have added. Like SB, CS, Heroic leap, spell reflect
[2:34:57] Brokentrojanx: ??
[2:34:58] Ddocz: earthshaker: aoe mini stun/dmg/root Leap with grab: grab an enemy player and leap w him to a destination Glad stance... shockwave Stormbolt
[2:34:59] ballsofruenkiller: knockdown?!

[2:34:59] DrDannee: shouts could be cooler
[2:35:00] Ddocz: the list goes on and on
[2:35:01] Puco9: but is there an easy fix for warr pvp? the casters are too bursty for warriors to go deep rn
[2:35:02] OlleverTV: bladestorm
[2:35:06] Winttyrr: @SONII hey that's an idea. a rune that changes the ability based on the weapon you have equipped
[2:35:06] hamburglarhunter: Do like a commander thing for buffing people based off shouts
[2:35:07] darktoasty: warrior needs a grapple/grab
[2:35:07] Larrysix: Battle shout deals 1000% dmg and makes you twice the size for its duration
[2:35:10] sudd7: bladestorm 100% or shockwave
[2:35:10] EasyPeasley: quit yappin and get back to pressing slam mr. streamer
[2:35:15] theonlypadrejoe: they did a nice job wiht warrior tank, then made them suck

[2:35:15] dpbdagger: fk it give me leap back
[2:35:16] Eggzactly54: bandaid spec warrior but its a healing spec
[2:35:21] coldyair: Black Desert warrior is pretty cool compared to most games
[2:35:22] A5H0J: The warrior would carry 2 blunderbuses
[2:35:26] deathdemonic99: immune to death for 6 seconds
[2:35:29] NirvanaFlamez: Bladestorm at 60 ?
[2:35:37] ballsofruenkiller: they need to take blizzard away from mages and straight just give it to warriors... no resource cost.
[2:35:45] austin_545: They did nothing to prot warrior
[2:35:48] BlazyFM: it was always fun

[2:36:31] Skrimij_: attach chains to your weapons and swing them around like Kratos Fury Spec @sonii
[2:36:35] Puco9: the casters are too strong and bursty for warrior to just come close
[2:36:42] Larrysix: haha but many warrior players do
[2:36:44] DrDannee: brother does love to yap KEKW
[2:36:44] Tandersonp99: me either so sick of hearing that shit
[2:36:47] NirvanaFlamez: They should do a rune so that thunderclap applies rend to all targets and increase the target cap to 8+

[2:37:09] Kusig: Yes, because literally everyone in SoD is like MeTeRz
[2:37:10] miloxz: unless ur a warrior tank, yes
[2:37:13] WhySoSerious04: I’m from Jamaica Maaaaan

[2:37:45] RascarKapac_: Meters is what Sarthe use for bashing warrior while in pvp there is nothing to do with the 95% dps
[2:37:47] austin_545: well... most warriors that i know,  if they are topping meters its "fun" and if they arent its "not fun". @SONII
[2:37:54] PeasantNoMore: hes about to ask you for the shampoo name

[2:38:29] Puco9: tbh considering how much warr sucks in lvling, pvp, BGs and being the last choice for all these should be super dominant in pve to compensate
[2:38:29] elepa1337: They should make Axe thrower warrior man, a ranger warrior. Something new and fun @SONII
[2:38:36] rivetssore: Shoulda gave you the Windfury instead of druids
[2:38:41] darktoasty: he is just going super saiyan

[2:39:30] popitforchrist: what raid if that?
[2:39:41] ZhenMike: it could be cool to give warriors some range skills, like a reverse hunter
[2:39:56] sugawolf92: yo something is different here but I cant seem to put my finger on it. hmmm
[2:39:56] Nightbot: yo

[2:40:46] kragar_: ez
[2:40:49] A5H0J: I'm imagining warrior having Shockwave like Tauren chieftain in wc3
[2:40:54] Kusig: Give warriors an ability that breaks Pally Shield. call it Shield Breaker bypasses armor but takes 1.5 seconds to cast
[2:40:57] nwdelz: banners is an obv easy include that i think makes war fun
[2:40:59] Rogtar_: @ddocz no way in sod?!
[2:41:00] ballsofruenkiller: *marauder* warrior rune gives ability scream.. cost 10 rage increases weapon damage by X to surronding allies.
[2:41:14] holme08: Heroic leap, thoughts mate? :)
[2:41:19] Skrimij_: dude what if they gave warrior a rune that was like DK Runecarving but instead it augments the weapon for bleed/ stun chance/ explosive damage
[2:41:19] slapshotsd: @nwdelz i'd love a cata-era banner of recklessness
[2:41:19] Larrysix: they should give warrior an ability that dazes them but gives them an insane amount of dmg, like a drunken rage
[2:41:22] NericoTV: yea
[2:41:23] Kusig: Techbot
[2:41:31] girlz__: u can 2man
[2:41:32] Nekkco: yea just a quick 2 hour quest

[2:41:46] Rogtar_: @holme08 dope af
[2:41:49] NericoTV: bring the mats
[2:41:54] DrLegend305: what's that quest for?
[2:41:54] ballsofruenkiller: I just refuse to believe its hard to come up with new ideas.. u can read community feedback and they can give u 100 diff ideas.. they just didnt want to
[2:42:01] Nightbot: Want to Subscribe for FREE?! Connect your twitch to your (or parent's) amazon prime account  soniiLewd https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[2:42:04] NericoTV: bring the enchant mats and bars
[2:42:04] Kusig: DO IT
[2:42:04] ashhka02: no def do it
[2:42:05] girlz__: the long part is the shadowy figure cause u nneed to kill a lot of mobs for it to spawn
[2:42:05] holme08: Heroic leap, thoughts mate? :D
[2:42:06] kigami_uro: no you should
[2:42:07] ashhka02: -Ashand
[2:42:09] Kusig: like Shia Lebeauf
[2:42:12] LordRamAssington: you have to do it if you want crafting epics i think
[2:42:15] sudd7: tbf rogues were more than fine in classic and they're getting some good shit.
[2:42:17] Larrysix: why dont they just give warriors frost nova and blink
[2:42:18] Sonsuexd: to get the processor you have to go to 4 spots takes like an hr
[2:42:20] austin_545: stormbolt, warbanner, bladestorm, avatar, warbreaker, shattering throw, die by the sword are all good ideas for runes.
[2:42:21] miloxz: @girlz__ got it all done within 3 kills haha
[2:42:24] Sonsuexd: yes
[2:42:25] norxnz: yes
[2:42:28] LordRamAssington: yes
[2:42:28] girlz__: yeah it unlocks all
[2:42:30] NericoTV: if youre saved for gnomer alrdy bring the enchant mats and bars
[2:42:30] solembum86: the way you said it was like "oh lemme just go grab the pristine g7 core".... yes you should do it but thats why we are saying its a long chain
[2:42:33] slapshotsd: @holme08 he's already talked about it - it's cool cause it's more mobility but more mobility isn't the single thing holding warriors back rn
[2:42:40] DasBlueOne: DasBlueOne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Lil Hair change eh? Look at you cutie.
[2:42:43] OlleverTV: Ravager would be cool on warrior too
[2:42:56] NericoTV: turned in inside gnomer
[2:43:01] ashhka02: @sonii imagine if they gave us an ability as a warrior to concuss somoene causing their next global to be a random ability (not a cooldown)
[2:43:05] Sonsuexd: no he needs the processor anyways might as well do that first he can get the mats when hes ready to turn in
[2:43:08] prointv: Oh yow :D rip  hairs :D
[2:43:12] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: wsg weekend again..they really want ppl to grind rep
[2:43:17] Larrysix: @SONII i know the solution, give warriors nova and blink and make ragebar Blue.
[2:43:22] sudd7: exactly
[2:43:29] handy_grenade: we dont use shadow strike no mo
[2:43:31] Ddocz: and shadowstep ends up being a charge lol
[2:43:39] booddhi: my cat was trippin by that sound u just made
[2:43:39] slapshotsd: giving rogues shadowstrike has really turned me off from that class, and it's what i played in classic
[2:43:41] girlz__: yeah its either ab or wsg lol
[2:43:42] sudd7: 20 yard leap that does good aoe dam
[2:43:48] handy_grenade: mut baby
[2:43:51] Blide: Warbringer should be a book for sure. I really hope they do trinket slot runes as a wildcard, where any run can be placed on them
[2:43:52] miloxz: thank the lord for bg weekend
[2:43:55] girlz__: mutilate
[2:43:55] handy_grenade: mutilate
[2:44:02] sugawolf92: would Heroic Leap so bad for warriors? I get absolutely destroyed by warriors in pvp.
[2:44:08] TakeMeToValhalla: hey bro! ordered my new pc build, doing my first big boy build
[2:44:16] Wilcox57: even with epic helm, Axe, +3 wep skill epic belt my warrior feels like im playing a lv 35!
[2:44:19] SnewpDawg: If you got to design and implement a rune what would you add?
[2:44:19] Kusig: cross class runes in trinket slot GG
[2:44:22] Slaughter13x: I love WoW & I love PC & I love Anime
[2:44:26] handy_grenade: melee got fucked p2 pve
[2:44:27] zdogbroski: Just wait til 60 kek
[2:44:27] ballsofruenkiller: *blackened heart* warrior gives into the dark side. Increases warrior damage and mitigation by X. take 20 percent more damage.
[2:44:28] Papamyster: totally random idea ... what about giving Warriors a Knockdown and then a Damage ability that can only be used on a Knocked Down Target .
[2:44:30] handy_grenade: except hunters
[2:44:33] nowheretoday: Enough of warriors back to the hair
[2:44:33] slapshotsd: warbringer def should've been a book i agree with that
[2:44:54] booddhi: lol
[2:44:55] kigami_uro: give warriors a 5 yard range for melee lol
[2:44:55] ashhka02: lmao
[2:44:56] bawlsucka: doomfist
[2:44:59] ashhka02: im done
[2:44:59] handy_grenade: so pantheon ult
[2:45:03] NirvanaFlamez: 500 yard heroic leap
[2:45:06] popitforchrist: lol 15
[2:45:06] Rogtar_: Tripping
[2:45:08] ashhka02: thats it your done
[2:45:09] Naddah: like a ff dragoon
[2:45:17] Rogtar_: Dragon ball
[2:45:23] SavageSeb_: 15 Min Cooldown
[2:45:24] Sonsuexd: okay actuallllly tho.... that would be ideal
[2:45:25] Winttyrr: @SONII you know how hunter mele rune made raptor strike hit with both weapons? why couldnt warrior get SMF to let our abilities hit with both weapons?
[2:45:25] sugawolf92: you can have that but on a 2h cooldown
[2:45:26] Wilcox57: even with epic helm, Axe, +3 wep skill epic belt my warrior feels like im playing a lv 35!
[2:45:27] miloxz: oh no, you shouldnt have harthed
[2:45:28] handy_grenade: wat?!
[2:45:29] BrotherDanTV: What about a charge that you control/steer and knocks people up
[2:45:30] LordRamAssington: as a warrior main i approve of this message
[2:45:32] miloxz: you need it for the quest chain
[2:45:36] A5H0J: Forgot a helicopter with guns
[2:45:39] ballsofruenkiller: busted
[2:45:41] austin_545: yeah that sounds pretty good.
[2:45:43] handy_grenade: can you imagine that in the stv event
[2:45:44] popitforchrist: a jump slam would be dope
[2:45:45] sudd7: so, heroic leap, infernal, grippy hands bladestorm.
[2:45:49] handy_grenade: warrior flying everywhere
[2:45:49] Rogtar_: Whats that axe?
[2:46:02] kigami_uro: @SONII what about dragon charge, movement speed increase and you knock up everyone in your path for like 3s?
[2:46:06] AsteroidsBlue: and tac nuke at 25 kills or smht, right?
[2:46:09] dersonstige: TOO OP! should be just slowing 98%
[2:46:13] stoks002: 7 kills warriors get a helicopter
[2:46:14] ballsofruenkiller: i just get the ability to turn into a spriest .. thats the new warrior rune
[2:46:15] Wilcox57: summon a blad eagle to fly down and attack your target doing BIG DAM
[2:46:30] slapshotsd: "pumping iron" - channel for 2 seconds (your character sits down and does concentration curls, you're immune for the duration), then you flex on the enemy with your mighty pump doing 2x wep dmg ignoring armor and hitting all surrounding enemies with demoralizing shout bc of their tiny muscles
[2:46:31] zdogbroski: Shockwave seems necessary for PvP
[2:46:33] ballsofruenkiller: SANTA IS REAL
[2:46:42] A5H0J: WAIT WHAAT?
[2:46:44] Skrimij_: rage of the ancestors, spawn 2 clones of yourself that assault the target @sonii
[2:46:46] Kusig: what if god was one of us
[2:46:46] ashhka02: I  mean this convo is a helluva lot better than people awkwardly mentioning your hair
[2:46:46] sudd7: once you get to 25kbs a nuke comes down and kills everyone and your team wins the bg
[2:46:54] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: we have 2 b-1 lancer bomber at work here in sweden. cool looking aircraft
[2:46:54] iamkayto: Osu sonii san ! ~ good to see you bro
[2:46:56] EasyPeasley: Dude I checked my crypto for like the first time in 2 years and im up like $200 lol, was kinda funny
[2:47:08] Tranman72: If your aunt had balls she'd be your uncle as my Gpa used to say. Doesn't hold true in 2024
[2:47:12] SnewpDawg: Would be cool to see an unarmed build for warrior.
[2:47:37] solembum86: they should make a rune that makes it when you play warrior you have to admit to your dad that you are gay
[2:47:44] azzy_dog: can't get disarmed if you aren't armed! >:D
[2:47:47] OloCdn: the warrior Berseker stance quest guy ...just a brawler warrior class
[2:47:48] whil3z: they hate cus they anus @sonii
[2:47:49] sudd7: a stone cold stunner would be sick.

[2:50:40] Derezzed01: do you hang with shobek any
[2:50:43] Zankey: Ignore it. Check it again in 10 years. You'll have made money.   Usually with long term investments just forget about them even during hype. Unless you need the money, then ofc cash out.

[6:44:07] eXWeiner: do you take the plate set from raid for pvp and take the L on parses or just rock the leather set in pvp?
[6:44:10] FIREMAGZZ: you dont really care about it, but its useful for identifying natural blonds or girls who are lying. why she lying you know? comes in handy on tinder dates
[6:44:21] CAD604: think he always does lol
[6:44:25] sydance123: What server this chat?
[6:44:31] jackcousteau: @Sonii You can tone your hair but there will be a lot of upkeep. You would probably want to tone like every 2-3 weeks, but it's super doable. Since you bleached your hair will naturally be fragile so also keep that in mind. DONT rebleach your hair yourself lol have professionals do that. Bleach is hard on the hair. It will be hard to get it completely white, so if you really want that you may need to visit the stylist a couple of times
[6:44:35] borgeezie: crusader strike
[6:45:11] borgeezie: am I trippin tho? can someone explain the sword lmao
[6:45:25] stevis87: looks great imo
[6:45:31] borgeezie: yea but the lvl req
[6:45:33] borgeezie: 125
[6:45:41] borgeezie: so how ?

[6:48:47] stevis87: there are mods that can change the pc side of things but not server, i did that to get the black qiraji mount back when horde stole it fromy ally on illidan back in like 07 ish lol
