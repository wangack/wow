[0:20:26] Plokoon100: Mara is HUGE
[0:20:28] AmarokUnchained: my favorite dungeon
[0:20:29] asleepnotwoke: ST
[0:20:29] lizcat_: yeah they ruined questing in STV leave mara alone
[0:20:31] 13deadace1: ST is a raid already
[0:20:31] RanciusAdventures: cut the intro? we 20 minutes in already 🤣
[0:20:32] thatquidproquo: They should do ST
[0:20:34] Frostlicious: Sunken temple makes way more sense
[0:20:40] twisted_127: you spent along time in there
[0:20:45] EmpathyLiveChat: To be fair, that's true, I don't mind if they mess up ST
[0:20:48] Plokoon100: I saw epic items leaked for STV
[0:20:55] Plokoon100: ST

[0:21:08] AdoTaco: Sup
[0:21:08] ReconMazihoFanda: CONFIRMED!
[0:21:10] windatar: The idea is that Mara is already large enough for 20 size. But ST is complex enough for a 20 man. Also Dragons.
[0:21:23] dontbecold: pepoG
[0:21:40] Mawshaw: They literally said take datamining with a grain of salt and people IMMEDIATELY go back to acting like datamining is facts KEKL

[0:23:02] gigablue69: giga tits even
[0:23:07] Pudgypantss: 20 man 3 day lockout YIKES

[0:23:42] marckotobeloo: why not a raid in caverns of time?
[0:23:43] WhineGodTV: I WOULD LIVE IN SM FOREVER GIVEN THE OPTION
[0:23:44] windatar: Give me a Scarlet raid at 60 and put it in that Elite Scarlet zone in plague lands.
[0:23:44] Plokoon100: I bety you Hearthglenn is the new SM raid area
[0:23:47] Plokoon100: Ill bet money on it
[0:23:49] andyjamesgames: ST Prayge
[0:23:53] nochillcollin: ST is way better than mara too
[0:23:54] T_Bag93x: yeah and not that many people run it as a normal dung
[0:23:57] Afterh8: @WhineGodTV lol
[0:23:58] linkitcraig: i always thought ST had potential but was a shitty dungeon to run
[0:23:58] asleepnotwoke: how would you put mechanics for any SM dungeon with 20 ppl?
[0:24:01] grylz89: ST = buffing diamond flask?? Hype

[0:25:58] WhySoSerious04: He would rip them apart
[0:25:58] madness657: compton pitbulls xD
[0:25:58] twisted_127: “gang banger pitbulls “
[0:25:59] flochxx: gorill might kill like 3 or 4
[0:25:59] Bronloch: 10 pitbulls they would nip him to death by a thousand cuts
[0:26:00] grylz89: Gorilla would snap dogs spine with one smash
[0:26:03] fghtingspirit_2022: Dogs can take on wolves, so yeah
[0:26:03] Murgold: Gorilla and its not even close
[0:26:04] OggeNEFF: Gorilla will flex 'em off
[0:26:04] AmarokUnchained: the dogs are trained to hunt down gorillas
[0:26:05] svendvang: pitbulls, the gorilla wont have the stamina
[0:26:09] lizcat_: pit gets the gorilla on the neck it’s so over
[0:26:11] Mauraderss: gorilla would kill each dog with 1 punch
[0:26:11] Vecth: Heard Compton is all gertrified now so maybe the Ape
[0:26:13] dammitcyrus: gorillas have insance strength
[0:26:13] tdog_tim: I could see the gorilla freaking out, but that only helping it win
[0:26:19] EmpathyLiveChat: Do pitbulls hunt in packs?
[0:26:19] madness657: IF ITS IN UK THEN GORILLA CUZ PITBULLS ARE BANNED XD
[0:26:26] windatar: 10 pitbuls they lock jaws and the gorilla would bleed to death after killing most of the pitbuls but not all of them.
[0:26:27] thatquidproquo: Make Sunken Temple great again
[0:26:29] andyjamesgames: wait the pittys are from Compton ..? that changes things…
[0:26:35] ReconMazihoFanda: pitbulls if well fed on infants
[0:26:38] Bronloch: Gorilla only knows hammer fist no jab no bjj
[0:26:42] grylz89: What made u think of that lol
[0:26:49] Kenny_Marsh: @madness657 and gorillas are not banned? Keepo
[0:26:49] ibustquick37: Did you see the Mario movie? DK OP
[0:26:59] OneTouchBust: oops teehee
[0:27:08] karyouendan: LUL ore
[0:27:08] JohnTannen: oopsies

[0:27:16] Helios0ne: We talkin Michael Vick raised pitbulls?
[0:27:17] Bronloch: YEA DOG
[0:27:25] m3g4moose: It was intentional Clueless
[0:27:47] twisted_127: or 2 raids
[0:27:53] twisted_127: a 10 man and a 20 man
[0:27:59] haodab: can we get some oingo boingo soon?
[0:28:03] twisted_127: 2 diff places
[0:28:21] GoodlifeHS: No way
[0:28:22] asleepnotwoke: Mind blown
[0:28:28] thatquidproquo: Hmm maybe
[0:28:37] helmetnach0s: 2 10 man raids go at the same time, then meet up at the end for 20 man content
[0:28:38] madness657: they dont have the brain capacity for this smart idea
[0:28:39] Bronloch: OWL2019200iq
[0:28:43] ReconMazihoFanda: crazy
[0:28:43] MurlisWoW: GM STAYSAFE Salute
[0:29:04] twisted_127: always thought ST should be 2 like black rock spire
[0:29:15] Kenny_Marsh: 10 man with 3 day reset, 20 man with 7 day reset would be nice
[0:29:16] chargebotsolo: did solheim get swole? swolheim
[0:29:17] thatquidproquo: @murliswow GM !! BASEDCIGAR
[0:29:22] Bronloch: LEFT HAND SALUTE LUL
[0:29:22] Lava_in_a_Lamp: I think it's funny private servers can make really good brand new dungeons in Classic but the actual devs decide not to do this and simply reskin existing dungeons
[0:29:27] karyouendan: alliance such EZ mode
[0:29:27] windatar: Dragon raid bosses are back on the menu boys.
[0:29:28] Plokoon100: gettin into ST will be hell lol
[0:29:50] w1zzlet: @StaysafeTV hey how are you man hope you and the family are good :D
[0:30:02] Arathionn: Hello Mr Safe
[0:30:06] EmpathyLiveChat: GPT-4 is telling me that the gorilla would easily win. Its hide is too thick for pitbull bites to take it down
[0:30:11] grylz89: The ledge boss are very small platforms for 20 man mechanics
[0:30:18] handpickedbytim: Sadge i wanted a maura raid
[0:30:26] Pinguin012: klick in right order
[0:30:29] Plokoon100: i hate that idea .. ppl will always fuck up
[0:30:37] Mauraderss: missed opportunity not making mara a raid
[0:30:58] AmarokUnchained: mindcontroll
[0:30:58] JohnTannen: hehe
[0:31:10] Joewrx: fall through the stairs too
[0:31:38] ReconMazihoFanda: dragon's call gonna be amazing
[0:31:42] grylz89: U playing ssf or just gonna dabble
[0:31:51] Frostlicious: Dragon's call becomes a legendary?
[0:31:52] Cmacc45: Or do an eranikus +6
[0:32:00] AmarokUnchained: YEP
[0:32:16] mattbarz989: What leaked I'm here late
[0:32:18] Mauraderss: @staysafetv if you could choose the phase 3 raid. what would it be?
[0:32:19] ayeryry: dragons call! omg I jizzed when it dropped
[0:32:20] haodab: gnomer was boring hope this one is more like bfd
[0:32:24] helmetnach0s: eranikus 3D
[0:32:31] Arathionn: I was hoping for this so badly. I think i mentioned it like a month ago that ST should be the next raid
[0:32:34] OneTouchBust: spawns a world dragon
[0:32:43] ReconMazihoFanda: dragon's call become a legendary and summons 10 dragons on hit
[0:32:47] shaggy462: i 100% knew ST would be the raid
[0:32:54] AmarokUnchained: could spawn alextrasza :D
[0:32:59] Joewrx: big long giant WHAT
[0:33:01] dirk_Sora: NODDERS 6 hours minimum
[0:33:09] dirk_Sora: Kapp
[0:33:10] twisted_127: yeah get the boys together for more than 30 min
[0:33:13] pastterino: same, we need a long 7 day lockout raid
[0:33:14] OneTouchBust: LUL
[0:33:24] ayeryry: bigger is always better
[0:33:28] twisted_127: people log in do raid log out wtf
[0:33:30] Plokoon100: i wnt 8 hour raid
[0:33:32] shaggy462: thats my problem so far, the raids dont feel endgame
[0:33:33] AmarokUnchained: 24hour raid
[0:33:37] dontbecold: More than 7 bosses Pog
[0:33:52] Pudgypantss: 15 boss raid PogU
[0:33:55] NutterCircus: ST is the buggiest dungeon. Its going to be stupid.
[0:33:58] haodab: honestly the shorter raoids make them more accesible in a way, longer raids will make sod worse
[0:33:58] m3g4moose: A raid so long it doesn't have a reset until the phase ends
[0:34:00] Frostlicious: All day raid Naxx level
[0:34:01] AmarokUnchained: my first MC attempt was about 8 hours LUL
[0:34:07] Vecth: With it being a 3 day lockout still would rathre see it in the 1-2 hour range tops
[0:34:11] Vigo__M: This guy needs to decongest his nose
[0:34:16] mattbarz989: You joining the loa boss attempt with xar?
[0:34:22] windatar: @StaysafeTV ST 20 man raid also means that this raid will be current content even at 60. This stuff will be way better then Diremaul/Strath/Scholo unless those 5 mans get MASSIVE upgrades.
[0:34:58] AmarokUnchained: ends in winterspring
[0:34:58] shaggy462: yeah the green dragonflight q chain, was cool
[0:35:03] ReconMazihoFanda: the most epic quest chain that never was
[0:35:04] pastterino: it was the start of the emerald dream questline Sadge
[0:35:14] JohnTannen: ooo
[0:35:16] NutterCircus: Abandoned quest line Susge
[0:35:39] NotTheWheel: Oh goodie yer on early

[0:35:58] Kebabra_: Kebabra_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 30 month subaversary Pogchamp. New camera new room new house. We are so fucking bad
[0:36:00] cloudstrife543: TIME TO FINISHED THE QUEST LINE
[0:36:04] AmarokUnchained: strong caster trinket for defending BS in AB (scales with SP=
[0:36:10] NotTheWheel: o7
[0:36:15] ReconMazihoFanda: sod is the time to purify the ashbringer
[0:36:26] shaggy462: ST also had class quests, i hope they do something with that
[0:36:31] NotTheWheel: D:
[0:36:33] dirk_Sora: D:

[0:36:56] pastterino: the Scythe from that warlock quest is prob one of the coolest lookin weapon, I hope they do something similar
[0:36:59] NutterCircus: One time I spent 5 hours in ST. Its ridiculous.
[0:37:05] lizcat_: @pastterino yes!
[0:37:11] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Damn your cam looks nice today
[0:37:13] shaggy462: i really like ST
[0:37:24] Pudgypantss: Alliance having to run 500 miles to get to the raid KEKL
[0:37:31] reefo: eranikus is gonna shit on everyone
[0:37:44] cthulhufthagn19: Did they already try killing blood boss?
[0:37:46] shaggy462: they wont touch mara, its too popular, ST is the forgotton one out of them dungeom imo
[0:37:47] wavecadet: yo yo
[0:37:58] AmarokUnchained: yes
[0:38:03] Nooticer: they pick all the dungeons no one really does much to turn into raids
[0:38:09] dogtooth481: 3d
[0:38:11] pastterino: @shaggy462 same with BRD imo, they're prob just gonna adjust some stat values
[0:38:19] Plokoon100: One has an ability that grabs a raid memeber and puts em in the hole
[0:38:20] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Ironfoe from BRD Kreygasm
[0:38:31] Peoplewhinetoomuch: sstvWAT
[0:38:38] shaggy462: @pastterino yeah and gnomer is largely untouched for horde, theres a pattern!
[0:38:49] thecollector313: like kalagos in tbc?

[0:38:55] Cereal_Killa: u have to wake up anaya
[0:39:08] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Phase 3 is SM raid though?
[0:39:09] Thegreatmoomsie: Congrats on the new house!
[0:39:11] shaggy462: @alphan8or i think they'll save that for 60
[0:39:20] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYYhi4raPNg
[0:39:22] ATcaribou: sup @StaysafeTV house lookin good?
[0:39:23] ReconMazihoFanda: the stars are aligning
[0:39:44] shaggy462: ST at 50 and SM raid sometime at 60
[0:39:52] Cereal_Killa: i would say 99% is going to be ST. but ppl thought that even before the leak
[0:40:30] johnnyhopkinwead1: your blizzard is blinking
[0:40:34] johnnyhopkinwead1: wow i mean
[0:40:35] handpickedbytim: monkaHmm

[1:55:40] johnsmith_cb: STREAMSNIPELUL they dont have 1000 ppl
[1:55:47] robthehammer760: ya except people are spam dying without bloods apperantly so  lol
[1:55:53] dirbagdan: he takes damage from blood if you have it so more stacks would cause higher dmg. maybe the point is to pvp and hold stacks like crazy and then you must sacrifice earning th coins at the alter and instead die to the boss and lose them
[1:55:58] DINGODOGGERDUDE: @Synmachus yeah they're reconnected isn't it great to see
[1:55:58] Atomized: have they tried nobody dying at all yet

[1:57:15] Eran_: look lets try to achieve less ppl to just get it out of the way, but I dont think it would help either
[1:57:23] kota_d: im on a different server and i dcd like 20 times during the event
[1:57:25] thatquidproquo: yeah layer 6 crashed when boss was at 10%
[1:57:29] DINGODOGGERDUDE: @kingkimjim he's arena brain
[1:57:31] cthulhufthagn19: Maybe the strat is to try late at night when server is quiet
[1:57:31] Cereal_Killa: the whole server is lagging tho because that one layer is putting a strain on the rest of the server
[1:57:33] AxelFromAustralia: blizzard is making it difficult so people keep playing phase 2
[1:57:39] ikkiweber: it does lag less cuz its less people computing other ppls actions at their layer

[2:06:01] VenomVeinZ: ppc still cant find the boss KEKW
[2:06:09] IAmLubes: possibly super dumb idea. the cave in the mountains, that the bengal tiger was supposedly located, when the boss hits 20% someone should be there

[2:06:40] ShooterMcGavin827: @StaysafeTV i think a logical argument is blizzard doesnt intend for only massive groups doing this event with hundreds of people... what about the small servers
[2:06:46] ShooterMcGavin827: is there chance you still missing mechanic
[2:06:55] ReconMazihoFanda: payo's fault
[2:06:59] Cereal_Killa: he was prob the only one with 100 bloods
[2:07:08] 3verythingatonce: he like grew in size the whole fight too he was small in the beginning
[2:07:23] Moo360: diabetus
[2:07:23] sudd7: thats what i was thinking. the more bloods you have, obviously the more bloods he takes. and the more blood he takes, the more dmg he takes?
[2:07:28] LARGE_CAPS: ldk let’s just find the cure for cancer instead
[2:08:21] steevwtf: imagine making a huge pvp event with a giant raid boss that no1 will kill because the servers cant handle it LUL LUL

[2:11:41] crouder: being a melee in phase 2 really sad
[2:11:50] pizac7: do pets cause healing because they dont have blood stacks?

[2:12:55] go00se: poopy
[2:12:56] Ropy123: @Plokoon100 true, they should remove melee from game, only range Kappa
[2:13:03] hawksareflyin: everyone should make sure to chomp power gum for max dps
[2:13:05] sudd7: prayer of mending is bis. instead of getting one shot, you get healed.
[2:13:06] Frostlicious: You carried the tanking moving the boss
[2:13:11] aalaavaa: Hehe Kekw Poggers. FR FR No Cap. Just like supporting my local WcDonalds resturaunt. WcDonalds has the greatest wries and wrandwhiches. A quick and easy meal for an affordable price. I love WcDonalds!

[2:14:33] ShingaTV: did someone looked into logs?
[2:14:51] Owendgg: @StaysafeTV Wouldn't constanly kitting the boss a thing? As the boss keeps leaching health from ''nearby enemies''

[2:20:42] Frostlicious: If the boss > then players stacks there is a mechanic?
[2:20:45] FrostyMethod94: why would they create an event that would require a whole event just to do a pve event 3hrs later

[4:48:25] Cereal_Killa: if the mage would stop casting on u and started casting on the boss u might be ok

[4:50:19] saund: not the arena
[4:50:19] Aacro: altars
[4:50:23] dodgydad33: it looks like its got 806 Trillion health left
[4:50:26] tommysalamiwow: It's the bruised debuff more than likely, what else can it be for
[4:50:34] M000gul: dying with a lot of blood
[4:50:37] Ruinx81: If he didn’t heal ever he’d be dead gotta get that sorted
[4:50:38] M000gul: to the boss
[4:50:39] Plokoon100: soooo why can we get him that low. then hit a wall
[4:50:40] Neraxor_: maybe dying to the boss with a lot of stacks?
[4:50:41] Ropy123: @pisketti people actualy believe this what Blizzard planed, but the truth is, even Blizzard has no idea what they are doing
[4:50:42] QuestFor420: KEKW
[4:50:45] johnnyhopkinwead1: tommysalami Pog
[4:50:45] Cereal_Killa: they wouldnt make it the arena because he doesnt always spawn at the arena
[4:50:46] akiimbo_sliice: so epic
[4:50:48] niigghtmare34: so much cope
[4:50:50] asleepnotwoke: @StaysafeTV everyone needs to stack 250 bloods for the next event.
[4:50:54] asleepnotwoke: Ttell that to them
[4:51:02] helmetnach0s: get that PR
[4:51:03] obajawanke: I don't think it's possible
[4:51:06] dontbecold: Progging STV Pog
[4:51:06] helmetnach0s: Epic PR
[4:51:08] pisketti: @Ropy123 yep, they just throw shit into the game and cross their fingers
[4:51:13] mattygisme: 255 x 40 is over 10k
[4:51:16] linkitcraig: u need to farm 255 on a non-boss kill attempt and then use that the next event
[4:51:17] ATcaribou: can you hold stacks between events?
[4:51:18] Mauraderss: try again tomorrow
[4:51:19] Counter_99: feels like race to worlds first

[4:51:34] DuoX: i don't think there is supposed to be a meta lol
[4:51:35] N_Tys: I feel this will be a once off
[4:51:47] Ropy123: @pisketti  haha yea, even their ideas are RNG
[4:51:48] HEIZALL: this boss spawn 1 time of the week ?
[4:51:49] Swaggerhound0: staysafe use your brain for a moment. the boss has 3.1 million hp. there are 500 people there. this would mean you guys only did 5 dps over the course of 30 min average
[4:51:51] linkitcraig: @STREAMSNIPELUL Nerdge
[4:52:01] Ropy123: just the tip?

[4:52:21] melvindorkus: linkitcraig use your brain for a moment. the boss has 3.1 million hp. there are 500 people there. this would mean you guys only did 5 dps over the course of 30 min average
[4:52:22] leonflux_: that other layer didn't have polar griefing xD
[4:52:25] helmetnach0s: So why are the other layers so much better?
[4:52:27] englishurza: 13% no blood turn in we just fought em
[4:52:27] Raivan994: I got him to 3 , trust
[4:52:29] OGWello: its prob just broken, yeah?
[4:52:32] obajawanke: @swaggerhound0  you can't account for his healing oer second when people have 0 bloods
[4:52:35] NiMBY90: I wonder if theres a max limit on bloods that gives you a certain buff (winkwink) that gives everyone more damage to close the 5-6mil. :)
[4:52:36] VenomVeinZ: SSF TIME
[4:52:43] HeIlraiser_: imagine saying GM  please sor can I have some more lol
[4:52:44] linkitcraig: @melvindorkus lmao
[4:52:49] asleepnotwoke: More blood is better
[4:52:51] mike_the_plumber: did he have a blood fury debuf or something
[4:52:51] snake_like: lmao hitting x10 damage mutilates is "uptime". cmon man
[4:52:55] asleepnotwoke: will need to stack bloods
[4:52:57] leonflux_: the bonus damage seemed to cap out eventually.
[4:53:00] darthterac: linkitcraig moon2B
[4:53:00] helmetnach0s: it’s the arena 100%
[4:53:02] jodihighrolly: for sure I’ve never hit a 2k chimera shot before that
[4:53:02] akiimbo_sliice: ASMON IS ONLINE. HE WILL FIGURE THIS OUT.
[4:53:02] Swaggerhound0: obajawanke use your brain for a moment. the boss has 3.1 million hp. there are 500 people there. this would mean you guys only did 5 dps over the course of 30 min average
[4:53:03] johnnyhopkinwead1: @snake_like KEKW
[4:53:04] KKonaStevieG: Prayge he drops vendorstrike
[4:53:05] nutwerthmaximus: you guys need 500 streamers all with 2k viewers so the servers dont crash
[4:53:13] nearoz123: just get the people that were there onto the same layer and its done
[4:53:19] wookieenthal: nt though
[4:53:20] PawgersHC: what made him get bigger
[4:53:21] stokes_t: he also has the ear trophies
[4:53:26] darthterac: Pease STOP this absolute bs. You guys are ruining the game for EVERYONE else on the server. Lag is UNPLAYABLE, keep getting DCed - can't play the damn game we paid for. You can't even down the thing so stop trying, you're being such idiotic self important a-holes. GTFO seriously man. You pretend to care about other players but clearly dont
[4:53:26] obajawanke: @swaggerhound0 at 20% he has 16 million
[4:53:27] Arcsilin: all the blood rushed to him and he became erect
[4:53:35] Ropy123: @Arcsilin LUL
[4:53:35] artilectXLII: what if blood turn-in makes him bigger?
[4:53:36] Raivan994: the loa is big and it keeps getting bigger
[4:53:37] NippleResident: @akiimbo_sliice mason gold?
[4:53:38] PawgersHC: he was fully erect
[4:53:39] sudd7: it would help if every single mage wasnt casting arcane explosion farming coins.
[4:53:41] SwepsGaming: get more gear kekw =D
[4:53:44] Grishyy: did the boss died?
[4:53:45] mattygisme: What if enough is turned in before he is at 20 precent to satiate him?>
[4:53:48] Aacro: @Arcsilin gachiHYPER

[4:53:57] Lyrian117: Turning in blood prob makes him bigger
[4:53:58] wookieenthal: in 3 hours
[4:53:58] genjimainofc: MORE LAGG NEEDED NODDERS
[4:53:58] HeIlraiser_: more blizzard ass kissers needed YEP
[4:54:00] Valencia_Pete: get full blood then kill boss, there has to be a reason for the blood cap right?
[4:54:01] Deforzius: do something
[4:54:02] einself111: call asmon EZ
[4:54:03] Plokoon100: why don’t you kite him to booty bay and let the goblins kill him

[4:54:27] wookieenthal: zonemannnnn
[4:54:30] tommysalamiwow: bet my left nut that gives the damage
[4:54:37] PreferablyBaked: asmongold pls save us
[4:54:38] ohioliving: PogChamp
[4:54:39] Boosticuff: Tommy might be onto something 5Head
[4:54:40] Plokoon100: ooo maybe
[4:54:40] snake_like: maybe he gets bloodsick and takes more damage. so you sacrifice a 255 blood boy whenever the damage amp goes away
[4:54:41] onewish_wow: 20k, 2,5k 0,8k 2k 2,3k, 3,2k soooo many ppl watching Blood moon event
[4:54:44] leonflux_: @Swaggerhound0 Turns out an entire guild intentionally healing the boss for the entirety of phase 1 negates 95% of dps.
[4:54:45] lord_windir: 5Head
[4:54:55] halfwayz6531: bruised make you lose blood faster
[4:54:56] Totalko: I thought it launched half an hour ago.
[4:54:56] lukersz: @Valencia_Pete yeah 255 is highest 8bit number
[4:55:00] saund: dying to a boss makes you do more damage? seems weird
[4:55:02] Eran_: but u guys alway had the bruised debuff at all attempts
[4:55:04] weahhc: blood moon event its sod ph2 content
[4:55:31] KKonaStevieG: asmon said he's getting on after he cleans his room Kappa
[4:55:33] ccnn24: bruised obv increases damage in an attempt to normalize or equalize the pvp
[4:55:40] Sowiloo: bruise deez
[4:55:40] FrostyMethod94: that means a normal raid would gain more stacks of bruised and deal more damage
[4:55:41] stokes_t: i think less people would help with more bruised stacks
[4:55:44] waxtap: its not happening
[4:55:44] sudd7: i was at 10 stacks of bruised and my shadow word pain was doing the same dmg. but idk
[4:55:45] Valencia_Pete: @lukersz eli5?
[4:55:46] linkitcraig: SCHIZO
[4:55:47] PawgersHC: but the more you die your gear breaks and you don’t do damage

[4:56:03] SwepsGaming: he surely drop Ashbringer!
[4:56:03] HeIlraiser_: dual ass kiss award lol
[4:56:13] ccnn24: so you have to start naked, die 30 times, then kill
[4:56:14] criblica: Drag him to booty bay and let the guards kill him
[4:56:14] waxtap: raid logging for a world boss that doesnt drop anything
[4:56:23] Despiche: S-Mart Kappa
[4:56:27] criblica: and having that many will never be intended, so thats a red flag
[4:56:30] poggersshaman: it doesnt
[4:56:37] snook_og: doesnt fall off offline
[4:56:39] obstata: raid logging bruised debuff
[4:56:40] HeIlraiser_: from private to retail KEKW the story
[4:56:42] BadGerbilLion: sarthe trolling
[4:56:44] beanman_gaming: the devs overcooked on this one
[4:56:58] TheKraken2024: Are we doing horde for HC SF?
[4:57:04] Faedrik: @beanman_gaming They're missing something, obviously.
[4:57:14] wookinit: i dont thin anyones cooking'
[4:57:23] melvindorkus: i doubt its the arena because he spawns at any of the altars
[4:57:26] lukersz: @Valencia_Pete its computer code stuff
[4:57:31] Cluzza: i wanna see it die, but i dont think blizzard wants that
[4:57:33] snake_like: nah, it's not the arena with his rng spawn
[4:57:37] Raivan994: blizzard doesnt expect this at all lmao
[4:57:38] helmetnach0s: use your brain people
[4:57:40] niigghtmare34: hes not killable
[4:57:41] Grishyy: honestly... I think its not meant to be killable until p3
[4:57:48] lukersz: @lukersz look up 8 bit 255
[4:57:56] snake_like: "use the gnomeregan shades"
[4:58:03] beanman_gaming: there’s a wbuff associated with killing  him, it should be doable
[4:58:06] wookieenthal: hobgoblins! noodle knockas!
[4:58:23] dirbagdan: i think the number of stacks isnt the key i think its just that people need to wait to turn in after 20% to get that dmg ticking down
[4:58:27] wookinit: imagine thinking the devs put something that takes this much bs
[4:58:28] Geriden01: Let's think what made him take more damage after 20%
[4:58:34] Gealls: Everyone should use full irradiated set to give boss radiation sickness
[4:58:43] mamdoh123: SCHIZO 󠀀
[4:58:44] soyx: when is SSF out?

[4:59:19] melvindorkus: the smoke alarm is going off
[4:59:19] snake_like: no the meta was blizzard expecting people able to pump out more than 10 dps over 30 minutes in a lag-free serve
[4:59:19] niigghtmare34: he didnt die because hunters got nerfed
[4:59:27] Valencia_Pete: @lukersz i did, i still don't understand why that would make it a cap in wow tho.. there are values way higher than 255 all over the game.. im a farmer though and know nothing about programing so probs im just out of my element
[4:59:28] Pinguin012: i have heard that if you sit naked in front of the pc you do at least 3-5 times the damage

[4:59:57] mike_the_plumber: and turn in to give him stacks
[5:00:00] ReconMazihoFanda: the tactic for this boss is just dps him down and try not to die so he dont heals
[5:00:11] niigghtmare34: blizzard isnt going to say shit lol. They are probably making fun of you

[6:05:58] Elder_hyrule: they crave social interaction
[6:06:00] SaxNViolins: If you play SF, you're likely to be gimped a bit. For new players of classic, it could be rough as your options are limited. Gain a prof that helps your class gear up  or something like that.
[6:06:00] SpaceGhost8: we don't know what you like in a game

[6:06:32] hannsoloxp: only reason i watch twitch is to see someones opinion on new content
[6:06:36] aoe_enjoyer: What if they want feedback from a community that makes them feel cozy, this is a cozy place
[6:06:48] xTrueEast: people need recomendation on everything thats why marketing is always booming

[7:26:01] Cenarios13: @Fredmonroe11 tried with 0 and 15 stacks and the damage was identical when the boss was at 100%

[7:59:35] hathor488: I can't tell if the streamers are trolling, the buff on the boss makes him take more damage. It was datamined.
