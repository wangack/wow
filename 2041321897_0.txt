[0:09:38] zerozuckerl: did you guys really enjoy the uberdanger one? it was mostly cursing dying and inting his pugs lol
[0:09:53] zerozuckerl: only really good part was the deathroll stuff
[0:09:57] Xeronismm: @zerozuckerl i thought it was good
[0:10:01] Movu: Raid hyyyyyype!!
[0:10:02] brie_feusang: It was funny in a 'hes so bad' kind of way
[0:10:13] Seoken1: moooo
[0:10:17] bakedthief333: Yeah its nice seeing someone with the first try perspective and the death roll episode 👌
[0:10:23] brie_feusang: Like when he couldnt hold aggro in the first episode as Warrior
[0:10:30] neonloon: Yeah it was funny but he did shit that would make me /ignore lmao
[0:10:46] zerozuckerl: pretty deranged comment kek
[0:10:53] Maiqthehighking: what tf?
[0:10:58] Poisonj3lly: Huh
[0:11:12] bakedthief333: Yeah just ignore people like this lol
[0:11:20] brie_feusang: You can keep saying he's a pedo with no evidence or argument, it will only win over similarly baby brained individuals
[0:11:25] neonloon: He had some allegations like 3 or 4 years ago idk I don't remember
[0:11:44] NicoriousBIG: !sodcore
[0:11:44] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[0:12:26] brie_feusang: I mean this with kindness, why play on an RP server and not RP?  There are plenty of normal worlds to pick
[0:12:48] shloom995: @MitchJones yoo
[0:12:56] BootsTheAlpaca: @brie_feusang RP realms havee no automatic PVP flagging, so it's perfect for hardcore
[0:13:06] brie_feusang: Oh really I did not know that, interesting
[0:13:08] BootsTheAlpaca: I believe that would be the reason
[0:13:21] zerozuckerl: @brie_feusang lava lash was really scarcelly populated afair and they kinda knew sodcore would pop off, and it had to not be pvp
[0:13:27] Movu: Also, they do RP at least a little bit! lol
[0:13:45] zerozuckerl: the amount rav is RP walking is prolly enough Rp for the whole guild
[0:13:54] bakedthief333: And it's more entertaining for him and viewers to see RP along the journey
[0:13:56] BootsTheAlpaca: LOL true
[0:14:06] bakedthief333: Haha
[0:14:21] neonloon: Unless the spirit healer is in your lore, then I think HC is the most RP
[0:14:25] brie_feusang: RP servers do have a certain charm to them you don't get on normal servers this is true
[0:14:32] zerozuckerl: any golden Kappa enjoyers today?

[0:58:51] Xzanelol: the quest that has you running for 1hr
[0:59:03] vehops: @Xaryu yo do you think a totem harness rune would be cool for shammys in SOD, So that the totems buffs stays with the shammy so you dont run away from them ?
[0:59:07] galazkaryan: @huckleson pshhh
[0:59:08] adam_brisbane: it says 60 peacebloom and silverleaf
[0:59:10] LyteKrame: How did the rest of SFK go? I had to jump off

[0:59:57] Jayceza: what did arugal drop?
[0:59:57] blazzedzz: Water totem quest is just running back and forth Barrens and silverpine could herb at the same time
[1:00:03] NeverKrowsBest: gl farming herbs
[1:00:17] Reaperz_kinetic: HST isn’t needed. it barely makes a difference

[1:01:06] LyteKrame: So did you get all your LW gear then i suppose?
[1:01:14] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[1:01:15] Videx240: @ykasonni87 queso
[1:01:16] espi: Wild Growth prioritizes by distance, so pets in ranged groups usually dont get healed
[1:01:27] vehops: @Reaperz_kinetic oh okey. sick thanks

[1:04:00] Codratz: taunt asap after explosion on ghamoora, it's a threat reset
[1:04:03] espi: Gamoora stacks sunders, get a pet to tank for a bit
[1:04:04] Videx240: PayPal to the moon
[1:04:05] kirk_hunts: Other people can kill you on ghamoora if they hit orbs they can launch you into orbs

[1:04:07] galazkaryan: show skill ups xaryu
[1:04:16] Zonex2004: Avoiding orbs from tank melee a bit suss
[1:04:24] DislexicDude1: Barrybee VoD from today?
[1:04:25] lukemeleney: it's a balance though right? One of the challenges for SSF is that DPS is low so any higher dps on the boss fights might help more than 40 extra hp
[1:04:35] oldironforgy: Hi Xaryu, shampoo everyday or every other day for optimal hairmaxxing?
[1:04:46] galazkaryan: on your chat tab
[1:05:09] cereal_675: what gets most people killed on Ghamoo-ra is getting bounced into bubbles, afaik
[1:05:16] yohadue: the level isn't that big of a deal bc you need more herbs than 1-150 for alch
[1:05:17] m4w_13: started at 15 as tauren :)

[1:05:32] Kickaris: im oily af
[1:05:34] nich0w_: all depends on how oily it is yeah
[1:05:39] bryn_dee: The more you shampoo the oilier your scalp gets
[1:05:39] ebe____: im bald should i use shampoo
[1:05:40] Truthseeker96: i never shower
[1:05:40] zantu619: u are correct
[1:05:41] Reaperz_kinetic: @killamiketherealkillamike not in a while like over a year
[1:05:43] inspect4: yeh for dry scalp shampooin every day is rly bad
[1:05:44] mandude42069: i shampoo when it feels oily
[1:05:49] nich0w_: my hair is dry af and I can't shampoo every time or it's a nightmare
[1:05:50] Zonex2004: Long hair is a lot more hassle than it looks
[1:05:55] yohadue: according to wow-profs you need 65 peacebloom, 65 silverleaf, 100 briarthorn, 35 bruiseweed, 10 mageroyal, 10 stranglekelp to hit 150
[1:06:01] bryn_dee: constantly washing away the oils makes it so your scalp gets oiler faster
[1:06:08] graziNNN: so ez with ghost wolf
[1:06:11] iamabirdttv: ghost wolf and cheetah are fire
[1:06:13] graziNNN: and you can pick in form

[1:06:21] fetza108: @Xaryu  you will be ready to raid?
[1:06:25] MiseSC2: ya, fun fact, stop using shampoo for a few weeks and you;ll never need it again, it makes things worse lol
[1:06:35] grizzlyhead: Is this the herb stream everyone has been waiting for? :)
[1:06:37] Reaperz_kinetic: @ebe____ naaaah nah don’t get chat started again
[1:06:38] manuelespanolo: did he react to barny yet?
[1:06:42] Kilraith: Did you already get the fap recipe
[1:06:48] inspect4: @MiseSC2 nah depends on ur hair type and skin type thats bs
[1:07:00] MiseSC2: haha word
[1:07:01] PuffnTuff: i hardly ever use it
[1:07:03] zerozuckerl: @MiseSC2 ye I agree I dont use it anymore any its great, but for longer hair its different

[1:07:11] MiseSC2: probably not for longer hair ya
[1:07:18] StandardOut: Daddy @Xaryu, I thought this was gonna be a different type of herb stream
[1:07:21] northern__soul: I hardly use shampoo just conditioner once a week
[1:07:22] running_backing: is there a really mild shampoo or something to switch to?
[1:07:25] Zecxx: @Sunderwire_ going bald is a way to never use shampoo
[1:07:28] LuxzGaming: No way
[1:07:31] noxthentus: No, no you cant
[1:07:31] jumbawumba: fun fact: dont wipe for 2-3 weeks and you wont need it ever again :)

[1:08:04] drjabbar: I smell every day I don’t shower, but maybe that’s because I shower every day
[1:08:05] noxthentus: Take it from someone who went down with stress and didnt do shit for weeks.  No you cant
[1:08:05] Zonex2004: Do you sweat a lot doing competive?

[1:15:01] dungeonkeysyt: legend @duetoxplode_tv

[3:23:45] crvyxn: lets you swap to fishing uniforms, enhanced audio (i dont like this feature) and catch tracking
[3:23:49] bigsugg11: hows baby Xar doing
[3:23:49] sum1thatplaysgames: it is...its so much slower than just doing it yourself.
[3:23:51] israldir: try it
[3:23:51] GoldenFool69: It also logs what you get out of the pool which is nice.

[3:24:07] fetza108: xarEZ
[3:24:07] Totesmag0tes: he's good
[3:24:09] FZanix: It uses accessibility feature to use a keybind to fish and reel in, but if you cast too far out it doesn't work so I uninstalled.
[3:24:10] ddqoriginal: back in my day we had to do it ....
[3:24:13] newby_lt: Just had the Starsight Tunic Drop

[3:24:23] greatestever893: 50 is good
[3:24:24] PuffinGreen: you make an interact hotkey on mouse, and listen for splash you don't even have to look at screen its pretty nice
[3:24:27] Totesmag0tes: what bind is that on?
[3:24:31] crvyxn: i using fishing biddy for the double right click to cast and catch tracking (data rules) Nerdge

[6:13:27] FlowersAnger: At some point the more stam you get the more utility it becomes to give it to people with less stam even though you're the main tank. Maybe not yet but just beefing up the main tank 100% and not considering anyone else is probably not the best utility, but it has to be judged in the individual situation depending on how big of an upgrade it is.

[7:07:43] Shake4L: It wasn't rng lmfao.. the players didn't see the portal and they missed 3 shadow chains
[7:07:45] Leshi101: @Teem0time the tank stays in the boss to tank the mindblast with shadow resi pot, if u want u can swap to meele tanking it then
[7:07:50] kaizen421: Xarstomp will live forever in our hearts

[7:08:32] RonSwanson1616: its easy to miss in the moment, and they deff had low settings or something on
[7:08:32] kenxxys: 1 person misses and the other follows
[7:08:32] 4wardsjack: monka

[7:09:09] fergbongo: its not bugged
[7:09:09] sajuto_: i mean that's doubtful lol
[7:09:10] shakejunthc: Portals can spawn in portals.
[7:09:11] Kanooog: That's going to bring NIghtmares
[7:09:13] freelunch_: no way 12
[7:09:14] shakejunthc: *In pillars
[7:09:16] MattOriginal: no shot
[7:09:18] freelunch_: they missed it for sure
[7:09:19] Croden: it can happen
[7:09:19] gdkpgold: itsok just appel the bug

[7:09:22] Duhski: it does bug, it's happened to me twice, I have it recorded (not uploaded). 1st time 15, 2nd time 13
[7:09:22] brakealot: I've never had 12 but atleast 9 before

[7:09:27] pretty_cool_guy: i've seen it at 10
[7:09:28] fanniclap: I don't doubt ppl unless I have proof. saves you from lookin like an ass lol
[7:09:28] xWizard_Dx: I've been down for a while before with no portal. It's rng
[7:09:28] RonSwanson1616: the defense of I killed so many doesnt hold up. you can still miss seeing the portal,
[7:09:28] sabastro007: gotta kill priests and the tentacles that spawn after
[7:09:28] BarryMC333: all I’m saying is, I’ve killed 7 and wondered what was going on then back tracked and saw I missed portal
[7:09:29] ttvtracerg: sabotage?
[7:09:29] TransMutedMaya: no bug, no mistake, just RNG. Rare events happen
[7:09:30] That_pillar: the portal was hidden inside that pillar
[7:09:30] notslumps: THEY WERE IN ON IT BRO THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE
[7:09:31] officialcrispee: That can happen literally has happened to me
[7:09:32] CousinAvi86: 12 without a portal is more likely than a bug, its most likely they missed it
[7:09:32] sengip: @Xaryu  that's the beauty of hardcore low key. That feeling when you died vs a normal wipe can't be replicated. Harcore will ways be the best type of gameplay. @Xaryu
[7:09:33] rosbaek: link to clip ?

[7:09:38] Choopaloop: upload it then
[7:09:38] elontuskhc: Not a bug
[7:09:39] zNeffy: I killed 15 with no portal
[7:09:40] Spankyisback: I had that 2 times already - so it´s real rng
[7:09:41] mcdewbie_: I've had to kill 15 for a portal once
[7:09:41] Badbotqt: one kill doesnt make the next one more likely to spawn a portal, statistics 101
[7:09:41] stroobzbeats: LETS SEE IT
[7:09:42] sengip: @Xaryu  that's the beauty of hardcore low key. That feeling when you died vs a normal wipe can't be replicated. Harcore will ways be the best type of gameplay. @Xaryu !
[7:09:42] TEEEEmac: no shot they killed 12 in that time. They had terrible DPS
[7:09:46] Djetouuu: they missed it for sure
[7:09:46] Strife_Bruhh: BULLLLSHIIIIIT
[7:09:48] Tropicocity: It definitely does not spawn sometimes
[7:09:48] Pixiepantss: its bad rng
[7:09:48] TransMutedMaya: no bug, no mistake, just RNG. Rare events happen!
[7:09:50] Snakix: since you died, Barny before sleep or no ? ^^
[7:09:50] ImBlaney: Xar i checked the log
[7:09:51] Choopaloop: pics or it didnt happen
[7:09:51] theguunch: bad odds both of them missed it
[7:09:52] running_backing: pretty sure if you hit the voidwalkers instead of the priestesses the portals dont spawn
[7:09:54] ImBlaney: they killed 8
[7:09:54] officialcrispee: Dude ive had to kill over 12 for a portal it happenes
[7:09:55] simlyng: @Xaryu I've killed 10 until it spawned, but never more I think. Sometimes 3, sometimes 6..
[7:09:56] stroobzbeats: pics or fake news
[7:09:56] itsbrysontv: FOTTAGE?  GIGACHAD
[7:09:57] brakealot: I killed Hogger 19 times still no portal @Xaryu
[7:09:57] jayfrytv: 12 hard to believe, but I’ve had the same shit happen to me before , no recording unfortunately
[7:09:57] WhySoSandy: the COPIUM
[7:09:58] bendox888: i did it 3 times tonight and we had to kill 6+ add each time and sometimes it didnt opened @Xaryu
[7:10:00] Gherito: Today we went 8 without portal. But a few guys told me in the guild they had that bug.
[7:10:01] mlbAct: @xaryu he already said he wasn’t
[7:10:02] Shake4L: They killed 8 hahahahahahahaha
[7:10:02] ImBlaney: replay
[7:10:06] freelunch_: RNG portal not guaranteed

[7:10:14] freelunch_: 8 is just bad luck
[7:10:16] despitefultv: 8 is 2 groups
[7:10:16] Strife_Bruhh: 8 and they were down for that long
[7:10:16] pretty_cool_guy: damn o7
[7:10:17] olibabbino: even 8 is high
[7:10:19] Thriser: let's be real, if 1 of them missed it, you think they're gonna show you a vod of them failing
[7:10:19] Strife_Bruhh: they fucked up
[7:10:19] freelunch_: 12 it wouldve popped
[7:10:21] esTeban30: check damage done to or even replay the fith
[7:10:23] martelko: I mean the portal is pretty visible, how can anybody miss it? also u die after 30 seconds if cannot find the portal
[7:10:23] scivationx: Still doesn't seem right I thought it was supposed to be 5 max?
[7:10:25] ImBlaney: go to the fight
[7:10:25] PuffinGreen: 8 is bad luck, 12 is unhead of
[7:10:25] Duhski: 8 is high, usually its like 2-5
[7:10:28] nerdymaestro: 8 is still a lot
[7:10:28] DonkleTV: you dont have to completely kill them either tho, if its a tentacle you move on usually no?
[7:10:31] Krewser19: can someone drop the death clip pls
[7:10:32] espi: 8 is bad luck, 9 is worst case, 10 is a bug or missed it
[7:10:32] Victen2706: Where are you running?
[7:10:34] shakejunthc: Go to lord kelris > Damage done > Enemy
[7:10:34] sgohst: go to the kelris fight
[7:10:38] kswissbaby: some mightve been a tentacle
[7:10:39] gregfork: Xaryu trying to read warcraft logs is ridiculous
[7:10:42] Klopernikus: u never read logs?
[7:10:43] fellifell: Ive had 8 twice in a row on my pally
[7:10:44] jayfrytv: they may have been including tentacles
[7:10:45] kswissbaby: that didnt die so it wasnt registered
[7:10:46] TEEEEmac: admission
[7:10:47] esTeban30: @Xaryu replay the battle animation from the logs
[7:10:48] brie_feusang: sus
[7:10:51] sengip: @Xaryu  that's the beauty of hardcore low key. That feeling when you died vs a normal wipe can't be replicated. Harcore will ways be the best type of gameplay. @Xaryu
[7:10:55] handstand_man: "killed alone" ? they weren't assisting each other ?

[7:10:59] nuerock80: shit happens
[7:10:59] Badbotqt: BOTH would have missed it? come on
[7:11:00] TakiitoPotato: they are in groups of 3 and 4, not hard to kill 8. they just over looked he portal
[7:11:00] brakealot: @DonkleTV think they can still drop portal so kill
[7:11:01] jirkasaurus: didnt he do damage before he went down
[7:11:02] Maddengod1287: they missed it lol
[7:11:03] stroobzbeats: facts
[7:11:04] Locofanta: watch the video of sleep phase they didnt click the portal  on purpose!
[7:11:06] fergbongo: what kind of damage was the warrior doing?
[7:11:07] Djetouuu: chcech wclog replay

[7:12:33] fergbongo: was the warrior doing damage?
[7:12:35] Teem0time: LUL LONG WAY
[7:12:39] gregfork: ran all the way across the room instead of killing the closer priests
[7:12:39] Lohai: they are taking forever
[7:12:40] mlbAct: i never knew you could do this! so cool!!
[7:12:43] pretty_cool_guy: damn

[7:12:51] pretty_cool_guy: guys they're in hardcore prebis gear
[7:12:54] Shake4L: Yah they suck
[7:12:55] Lohai: they got pretty unlucky
[7:12:55] pkprell: @Xaryu The Warrior should've just aoe shouted and done Retaliation while having 9 mobs on him, they would've died in 4 seconds 󠀀
[7:12:56] GULLASCHBARON: MORE
[7:12:59] Pixiepantss: one more time

[7:13:12] jacksunson: People in my guild said you need to kill the ones at the statues, not the pillars
[7:13:13] sengip: 9 is a shit ton, I go down every fight and kill like 3-4
[7:13:13] Reaperz_kinetic: wow you guys got incredibly bad RNG
[7:13:13] Pixiepantss: fuck man
[7:13:13] paranoia_gamer: that replay feature is OP
[7:13:17] rudisaurus: @shadowstar2080 i guess bcuz hes stream was suppose to last longer.
[7:13:17] stormrager117: No portal!?
[7:13:18] pretty_cool_guy: damn...
[7:13:18] Lohai: wait did they get a portal
[7:13:21] Syzlak3: so you cant see if portal was there
[7:13:22] cobraCordite: It's incredibly unlucky
[7:13:23] Locofanta: see if portals pop!
[7:13:23] t0kendubs: Play ur rotation down there and see if it shows a portal
[7:13:23] The_RightTwix: You have to get portal before 30 seconds
[7:13:24] pkprell: @Xaryu The Warrior should've just aoe shouted and done Retaliation while having 9 mobs on him, they would've died in 4 seconds.
[7:13:24] fanniclap: @Lohai nah
[7:13:25] datboiigandhi: Yo xar do a prediction on a 1-2 roll. Let us gamble @Xaryu
[7:13:25] gregfork: Bad RNG but also they across the room instead of going to the close prietesses
[7:13:26] H_9_K: NOO YOU DIED
[7:13:27] loppeo: rng
[7:13:27] xulfer14: Go watch when you got in this phase!! Maybe we can see the portal open
[7:13:28] Zonex2004: The split dps
[7:13:28] chorrol1: CHECK IF YOUR PORTAL SHOWED
[7:13:29] stormrager117: Dam dam dam

[7:13:36] Nerio27: no
[7:13:37] frunkness: THE TENTACLE THAT SPAWN POINT TO MOBS THAT CONTAIN PORTAL
[7:13:41] zuphry: @pkprell warriors dont have aoe taunt rn lol
[7:13:41] Shake4L: They ran across map to kill for no reason
[7:13:42] shedzo: !drops
[7:13:42] StreamElements: Xaryu has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the reward. Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[7:13:44] Strife_Bruhh: bro the warrior was doing nooooo damage
[7:13:48] stayinallive: you hate to see it
[7:13:49] esTeban30: not a mob / player
[7:13:53] MitchellScot: yo its possible to not get a portal yall lol
[7:13:57] Gherito: yee thats insane bad luck tho
[7:13:59] Reaperz_kinetic: @jinjzo they were doing that dude

[7:14:05] Pixiepantss: yeah its awful rng
[7:14:05] realandtruephobe: bad rng :(
[7:14:06] Locofanta: watch the video of sleep phase they didnt click the portal  on purpose!
[7:14:09] pkprell: @zuphry Not aoe taunt, you just demo shout all the mobs since they are neutarl > you tag them. Just cleave 1 camp > demo shout > retal
[7:14:09] Pixiepantss: its legit terrible rng
[7:14:09] TokyoLink: Seems like they both died about it being over 10. The type of behaviour you'd expect from people who missed the portal.
[7:14:09] hartman_: it's happened to me
[7:14:10] disturbed1994_: they went to slow
[7:14:10] Adem9x: RNG broski
[7:14:11] socom1211: thats happened to me before
[7:14:12] Fourleaf_TV: I have had it happen at least 2 times
[7:14:13] larnsmarf: GET THE DEVS
[7:14:13] fanniclap: nah i believe them
[7:14:14] Steters: just bad RNG, not a bug
[7:14:14] Riv_VK: no thats 100% a thing
[7:14:15] Malfunked38: BLIZ wants you to go AGANE
[7:14:15] disturbed1994_: it’s on them
[7:14:15] Croden: Yeah it's just rng
[7:14:15] beastleberry: My static group has not had a portal spawn before.
[7:14:15] stormrager117: o7
[7:14:16] fernandorbretas: OOMED STILL GOING STRONG THO
[7:14:16] Minikoal: rng for sure
[7:14:16] boofnut253: Its happened to me
[7:14:17] freelunch_: RNG happens
[7:14:17] sengip: Nah, after watching that I think it was just bad luck lol
[7:14:17] floddd: THAT HAPPEND TO ME "TIMES
[7:14:17] stepdaddy24: it happens
[7:14:17] clickityclacker: @Xaryu I've had that happen killed 9 no portal
[7:14:19] Syzlak3: what does it change you are daed anyway
[7:14:20] Djetouuu: never seen that
[7:14:21] loppeo: happened to me before
[7:14:21] clee0724: Thats just bad RNG for sure bro
[7:14:21] frunkness: TENTACLE MOBS POINT TO PORTAL MOBS THAT CONTAIN PORTAL
[7:14:22] NutterCircus: You can see them looking for a portal
[7:14:22] finde3315: its possible. gotta watch tentacles?
[7:14:22] shakejunthc: If you cannot see it, that means it spawned in a portal.
[7:14:22] bendox888: ye i had we had to kill 6+ each time we did the raid 3 times tonight
[7:14:22] johnnyzampano: rav paid them not to come up
[7:14:23] elydas899: 8 is more realistic and has prob happened to me
[7:14:23] SurrealAndre: happened to me before
[7:14:23] Bloodmage45: it happen to me
[7:14:23] cheen9: Ive had 7 a couple times
[7:14:23] paranoia_gamer: if a portal has a 50% chance, theres a world that no portal portals.
[7:14:24] GULLASCHBARON: you have to belive it/them : )
[7:14:24] sengip: Nah, after watching that I think it was just bad luck lol....
[7:14:24] tigerslap_ow: they obviously aren't incompetent players. I believe them
[7:14:25] Tatarek: It 100% happens
[7:14:25] KussTV: I've heard of the portal not spawning problem before
[7:14:25] pretty_cool_guy: 100% they just didn't get it at 8. they couldn't kill fast enough because they were in bad gear from hardcore. unfortunate
[7:14:26] DrDannee: BLIZZ FUCKED YOU
[7:14:26] sajuto_: do you auto die if youre down there long enough? ive never been down there that long.
[7:14:26] breezegodd: ive done softcore NO PORTAL its rare but happens
[7:14:27] jbdropbodies: It spawns after 6 no matter what
[7:14:27] The_RightTwix: They had to get it before 30 seconds, otherwise all the adds spawn. So the portal probably spawned under all the adds
[7:14:28] stroobzbeats: anyone who thinks they threw on purpose is clowning
[7:14:28] eygton: nah I bet they didn’t see it
[7:14:28] Combatsqrl: why wouldnt you believe them?
[7:14:29] Neko4all: sounds like bad RNG
[7:14:29] cyborgbear11: its happened to me
[7:14:30] zuphry: @pkprell yeah but then he auto dies cus theres no healer inside the portal
[7:14:30] Tras_1337: it can happen
[7:14:30] obstata: world first
[7:14:31] shedzo: shedzo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[7:14:31] IntrepidH: i thought 6 was the maximum beforee it spawns
[7:14:31] TEEEEmac: gullable is not in the disctionary
[7:14:31] numbyooo: I think 9 is max
[7:14:32] freesler: Ive killed 8 and not gotten portal many times
[7:14:35] fanniclap: @Xaryu I genuinely don't think they're lying
[7:14:36] Nickzorz91: Its just bad RNG.. ive had it spawn after 10+ before
[7:14:36] adumb25: didn't you guys have to kill a lot when you went down?
[7:14:36] Locofanta: how do u know they didnt get one portal?
[7:14:38] t0kendubs: RIP
[7:14:38] StunningPaul: OOMED pog. he knew.
[7:14:39] sgohst: i dont think so, i've killed around that many as well and never saw a portal but maybe i just missed it as well :( just one of those things
[7:14:39] epikvi7ion: yep we’ve killed 9 and it not spawn
[7:14:40] gregfork: They ran to the wrong priestesses, wasted time running across the room instead of going to nearby packs
[7:14:42] xWizard_Dx: So unfortunate, was fun to watch either way
[7:14:44] clee0724: ive had bad RNG with that too
[7:14:45] heylowdub: it should be a set number. Your life being in the hands of rng is bad game design
[7:14:45] drvichyssoise: !death
[7:14:45] StreamElements: Xarmon dead -> https://youtu.be/Jx_-RiVnCWA
[7:14:45] powerlinepreston: delete char?
[7:14:46] Darthvendor: @jbdropbodies hence why some are calling it a "bug" or an error if you will
[7:14:46] Pixiepantss: catJAM
[7:14:46] brakealot: I've killed 9 no portal
[7:14:48] Pixiepantss: pepeJAM
[7:14:48] FuffaIo: they chose a weird pathing kinda but just unlucky
[7:14:49] Sicmaggot420: You would have have the dps if they got loot
[7:14:51] Jumpshott_: why is he still playing
[7:14:52] Pixiepantss: DinoDance
[7:14:53] bendox888: where are u going ? @Xaryu
[7:14:53] jamiesgotagunn: dual wielding would have won
[7:14:54] JackBurtonBT: JackBurtonBT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! good run! was fun to watch
[7:14:54] drvichyssoise: can anyone link clip?!
[7:14:55] Reaperz_kinetic: @strife_bruhh warriors are gear dependent they only brought him cause of buff
[7:14:57] Pixiepantss: VIBE
[7:14:57] mackwon: where is he running to
[7:14:59] stepdaddy24: im not sure if it has anything to do with being slow does it?
[7:14:59] Gherito: we killed 8 today and didnt get portal. It is what it is. sucks tho.
[7:15:00] breezegodd: @Xaryu will deedge and party clkear?
[7:15:02] PuffinGreen: ya pathing was a bit off and terrible rng
[7:15:02] detourz28: I've had the bad RNG on portals too. That's kelris baby
[7:15:02] frunkness: @Xaryu THE TENTACLE MOBS THAT SPAWN WILL POINT TO THE MOBS THAT CONTAIN THE PORTALS
[7:15:02] s0rrybr0ther: If u kick and dispell you dont even need to heal
[7:15:04] valjuice1: we deleting the xarstomp or what?
[7:15:04] Okiswan: sod wasn’t “made” to be hardcore. I think Kelris was made to wipe groups sometimes
[7:15:05] TreeTopAnonymous: Hey Xar, was wondering if I could post a gofundme we put together for a wow guild member of ours. He just graduated for international business, got cancer, and due to be a father in 4 months. I am matching everything donated and more until the goal is reach. Not sure of the ToS for things like this but just trying to do something good for a good person.
[7:15:09] LaneWillingham: Could check damage dealt to the mob type that spawns the portals. That would tell you how many sent down
[7:15:09] ipntheshower: He is going back to his homeland to rest forever
[7:15:13] donnynorthcutt1: what’s next Xar
[7:15:15] chrislu18: taking tomorrow off?
