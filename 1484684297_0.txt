[1:40:54] gamernick410: You don’t know that lol you are making assumptions @nathanonfire
[1:40:59] t3nacityy: if they do anything tuning or nerfing in classic it's no longer classic

I'm wondering if you'd ever play it? I feel you'd bring life into the game again. It's surviving but, nothing compared to our WoW. Many blessings from NZ, been watching you since WCM days brother. Your videos helped me go from 330lb to 160. I'll forever be grateful for your role model.
