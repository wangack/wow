[1:20:42] Armdel: Personally im not too worried about this stuff, if people are unhappy after launch blizzard has time to make big adjustments
[1:21:18] medanmarko: I've plated PoE since 2013 and I feel its fantastic to have different ARPGS. D4 does not have to be PoE and PoE does not have to be D4. They fulfil their roles and niches perfectly and thats fine.
[1:21:23] Wulfgrym: People need to realize this is the launch and D4 has more content at launch than d3 has after 11 years. The game will be massive but it will take time
[1:22:17] Wulfgrym: Diablo 4 is the best thing to happen to the ARPG genre and the more good games the better for the whole space

[1:25:29] GamingDad77: @Wulfgrym I agree
[1:25:30] Havoc_S1: ^
[1:25:45] KeidooTV: snow flakes
[1:25:52] datkidkombo: I think Dragonflight hit a really good balance in this regard. I havnt played a wow expansion this long for a very long time and I'm still enjoying it very much, mainly because of not feeling compelled to do daily quests everyday.
[1:25:59] Armdel: the casual playerbase may drop off after 2 months though, then they gotta rely on the more "hardcore" players

[1:27:37] Armdel: PoE players don't even like PoE and just want a new ARPG
[1:27:40] Wulfgrym: I got called a corporate shill for buying the big diablo 4 package. been playing diablo since 1996. for nearly 30 years of entertainment. paying 120CAD for me is just supporting the franchise i have enjoyed for nearly 3 decades
[1:28:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: its nothing we havent seen or heard about yet
[1:28:17] Zigra1: as someone with 4 k hours in poe. . Simple is nice
[1:28:25] Armdel: people who have played endgame beta said this video was pretty terrible at showcasing the systems
[1:28:41] Anachron10: D4 skill tree is seriously lacking, I mean, very lacking. And I was hoping the paragon system would save it. 5+str+5Will+5int+5dext...nope
[1:28:41] GamingDad77: @Wulfgrym and I think that makes a big difference. How much you enjoy the game. I 100% agree with you

[1:29:34] Nehcrom: This is going to be lit.
[1:29:36] Wulfgrym: @GamingDad77 yeah i played diablo pretty much my whole adult life, 120 canadian for me is a drop in the bucket for something ill play for years forward

[2:57:38] Big_Wanshan: wORLD OF mOUNTS
[2:57:50] GrandGuy95: yah but to buy a card and spend real money then its a drop lol
[2:57:53] Dalsonson: Isnt the Swift Spectral Tiger confirmed to be a drop?
[2:57:55] Mazikeen69666: i quit wow during shadowlands, is dragonflight worth coming back for ?
[2:57:55] llNoTToXiCll: At the end of the daay its blizzard choice to do w/e the hell they want to with their mounts

[2:58:29] Teriyakibro: KEKW
[2:58:34] snake_like: even more of a reason to let it be a drop. I have a learned one and one in my inventory and I DONT CARE
[2:58:38] QueenAwakened: 6k for a mount lol
[2:58:46] ursinealli: "selling" someone has to actually buy it
[2:58:47] Aidler: I hope blizz doesn’t care about how much those mounts are “worth” out there
[2:58:48] royhandlesit: Or they want the card.
[2:58:49] Big_Wanshan: LOL
[2:58:53] Teriyakibro: nah thats cray
[2:59:10] Athinna: But as a business, from blizzards perspective, it doesnt matter because blizzard didnt sell that mount. Ppl did.
[2:59:24] Teriyakibro: rip
[2:59:30] Masqerader: I feel like blazing hippogryph would be the most likely mount next

[3:01:09] llNoTToXiCll: Maybe Blizzard is trying to counter these sellers
[3:01:13] Wcvechten: I can't wait for them to  make that a drop
[3:01:16] Ithylz: Isn’t it just a mindset thing? People who would complain don’t even have the tiger I’d bet
[3:01:21] llNoTToXiCll: by doing tcg mounts on twitch

[3:50:41] zodd_amhai: @theDirtyon3 u need that sweet 2500 thunder mog
[3:50:46] Tooyoo: pugging M+ is horrible this season compared to before. My hypothesis is that it is b/c M+ is more difficult, and everyone needs to do +20s for vault, not +15s
[3:50:55] theDirtyon3: I know i should at least get that real quick
[3:51:01] Rudric_Ice: You're a streamer so u don't count :)
[3:51:04] 91Niki: Honestly, I think that's due to the rating system. It's prone to make people 100x as picky
[3:51:06] Mecabeast: There's also the wave of the drama on the 4 dps timed key for this week
[3:51:48] SpoofAvatar: Meta or FO

[3:51:49] ArcaneSyntax: Bear druid in one of my keys this week with 15% ironfur up time, all he did was spam moonfire and taunt.
[3:51:57] OhNoNotAgain: @91Niki yes and no, there are people who also have weird logic in their picking and will overlook something because its x class and not meta

[3:53:16] 91Niki: Which isn't always the case
[3:53:55] ArcaneSyntax: When I tank keys it just kinda feels like I have to play every role, I gotta heal, sac interrupt keep myself alive and do lots of damage.

[3:54:22] Tooyoo: the other crazy toxic thing I've seen is it is so much more common to quit +20's if you dont make time. It's almost impossible to get +20 done for weekly vault pugging now.
[3:55:04] strchsr: @Towelliee Domino effect lol
[3:55:04] OhNoNotAgain: well doesnt help if you dont time anything above 20 it only gives you the IO of a 20 regardless if its a +24 that was just short of timing
[3:55:26] Scippa12: Is it true there is going to be a D4 crossover event in WoW?
[3:55:39] 91Niki: That's because +20s is full of people who think their peepee is larger than it is
[3:55:43] Tooyoo: @OhNoNotAgain yeah I understand the idea behind it. It just makes it so hard to get weekly vault done D:
[3:56:49] strchsr: @Towelliee Imagine if they removed the option to leave a party once a key was started unless you voted to abandon it like you vote to kick people in LFR
[3:57:22] zeiours: @towelliee Looking fresh
[3:57:30] ArcaneSyntax: Not sure I'd like a vote to leave option
[3:57:37] OhNoNotAgain: @strchsr could cause some people to be toxic and hostage, wouldnt be ideal
[3:57:58] 91Niki: Not to mention the people who think +20s is supposed to be MDI level of skill. So one wipe can make someone rage / rage quit
[3:58:22] ArcaneSyntax: Yeah hostage stuff happens in league and shit, would probably make it worse

[3:58:56] Tooyoo: @ArcaneSyntax They are changing that recently right? i read something about how forfeit only will require 3/5 now?
[3:58:57] strchsr: Tanks shouldn't get thundering imo

[4:00:28] 91Niki: I get overlaps can be awful. But in general, it's SUCH an easy mechanics to get rid of. People just prioritize dps over mechanics. The whole "eh, someone will move and get rid of it" logic
[4:00:38] Tooyoo: Ah true. I havent played LoL in a decade. But whoever comes up with a solution of randomly putting together ppl on the internet without toxicity deserves to be a billionaire
[4:02:12] ArcaneSyntax: The problem with thundering is that you want to maximize uptime and if mechanics get in the way it fucks the group
[4:02:16] strchsr: @Towelliee Who's ready for brackenhide on fortified/bolstering lmao
[4:02:19] Tooyoo: Maybe they should have made Tank "wildcard" and let tank clear on ANYone?
[4:02:28] 91Niki: I personally think the only reason why it feels bad, is because people are dumb and not doing mechanics ijpSHRUG
[4:03:12] ArcaneSyntax: It's not the worst thing in the world, but it's significantly worse than the last two season affixes have been
[4:03:26] K3NPO_: Rampers gonna Ramp
[4:03:49] 91Niki: It's one of those personal responsibility mechanics, which by far is what wipes dungeons / raids the most, cuz people tunnel vision

[5:30:41] Aidler: is this just a emotional personal standpoint of blizz or is there some logic and reason behind ret never being best?
