[7:50:04] iamonemanonamission: badges of justice?
[7:50:07] sunileif: titan juice?
[7:50:09] shugguls: just allow the currency in season 3 for example to upgrade season 2 and 1
[7:51:03] Thoreya: lol
[7:51:07] Thoreya: dude is living in a dream
[7:51:11] Thoreya: im sry
[7:51:18] sunileif: bring back halondrus
[7:51:24] Darko_sKiLLz: lol
[7:51:25] Thoreya: perfect balancing will never ever happen
[7:51:32] avenueone: thats why wrath classic was so hype s1
[7:51:39] avenueone: it wasnt a challenging raid at all
[7:51:44] sunileif: crab boss was fair and balanced
[7:52:17] sunileif: this reminds me that anduin recievedroughly 1.4 times the nerfs/tuning the rest of the raid got
[7:52:42] Thoreya: he mentioned the hardest raid in years
[7:53:32] sunileif: ruined! -throws chiar-
[7:54:16] addyz0r: yeah mes! stop trying to win awc
[7:54:18] crazzbez: is this guy shitting me or what
[7:54:19] rjstorbaek: ?
[7:54:19] addyz0r: :f
[7:54:22] Thoreya: is chess not competitive...
[7:54:23] Thoreya: lol
[7:54:24] Suited_Monkey: asmon is so cooked on endgame raiding
[7:54:28] Thoreya: stupid argument
[7:54:37] indithedog: any game with player vs player will have competitive crowd
[7:54:37] Darko_sKiLLz: -_-
[7:54:48] Thoreya: i know people love asmon and will agree with him on everything, but i completely disagree with his wow takes
[7:54:49] sunileif: random bgs are worthless
[7:54:52] peacant: world pvp isnt dead
[7:55:06] crazzbez: it was a mystery to me why asmongold received any viewers 5 years ago, it's a mystery to me to this day
[7:55:11] Thoreya: dude hasnt logged into the game in years, and repeats the same stuff he did 2 years ago
[7:55:16] crazzbez: sorry I'm out
[7:55:22] rjstorbaek: nobody wants to fail a key, sure. But anyone who pushes keys knows you will fail keys, it's part of the game
[7:55:29] Ronsimus: i dont love asmond, but i 100% agree with him
[7:55:41] Thoreya: why
[7:56:06] indithedog: He just plays mmos casually and doesnt understand a competitive POV
[7:56:07] Thoreya: its not the way, hes just wrong
[7:56:08] Thoreya: lol
[7:56:11] Thoreya: at least imo
[7:56:15] indithedog: theres appeal to both
[7:56:26] crazzbez: well there is no chance you agree with him that wow is not a competitive game
[7:56:53] sunileif: all these ummm talking points he has here will be fixed after worgens get tails
[7:56:58] rjstorbaek: All his points about m+ are wrong imo. M+ in its current state is the only reason I play retail. Dragonflight has been the best expansion since mists
[7:57:05] birrdknight: not gonna lie but I’ve only played once years ago and am thinking about trying again which is why I’m here but if I thought it was confusing then 😬 like how hard is it now
[7:57:07] TheEyeVII: "wow community council" oh boy..
[7:57:07] Thoreya: ^^^^^
[7:57:14] Thoreya: he has a hate boner for m+
[7:57:21] Landrysdad: I still play, but I agree with this take. The competitiveness in the game creates segregation
[7:57:34] Thoreya: as if its not by far the most played end game pillar in retail rn
[7:57:40] indithedog: @birrdknight very steep learning curve and lots of game knowledge to learn
[7:58:06] Thoreya: @birrdknight if you actually want to learn how to play, youll learn
[7:58:27] Thoreya: just may need to apply urself a little
[7:58:33] Steely97x: cos his bad at it
[7:58:36] rjstorbaek: Adge
[7:58:49] crazzbez: he's 1000% coping
[7:58:51] magusfree: what a moronic point
[7:58:54] crazzbez: so hard
[7:58:54] sunileif: i do miss when av was good
[7:58:57] Thoreya: u really agree with him here maes
[7:58:58] sunileif: and 6 hours long
[7:59:00] Thoreya: mes
[7:59:01] Thoreya: lol
[7:59:03] avenueone: @sunileif i still am good
[7:59:12] Thoreya: i mean come on
[7:59:24] sunileif: @avenueone are you tho?
[7:59:24] birrdknight: @indithedog I kinda thought it would take me a few weeks to learn this game if I watched a lot of other people. Ty
[7:59:34] dimitridq: the game would be a lot more fun if they put just a little more love into bgs
[7:59:37] sunileif: @sunileif youre no longer 6 hours long
[7:59:47] birrdknight: @thoreya very true
[7:59:47] shugguls: bring on solo rbgs
[7:59:53] avenueone: ya i feel great and have gone for more than 6 hours on multiple occasions
[7:59:54] sunileif: @sunileif youre like a 5 min rush to the end long
[7:59:59] Landrysdad: mythic + ruined the game
[8:00:06] magusfree: thats true but saying bgs were how the game was meant to be played is just his opinion. thousands of players who preferred arena for pvp would disagree
[8:00:15] Thoreya: @Landrysdad game would be absolutely dead if m+ wasnt a thing
[8:00:25] crazzbez: @magusfree +1
[8:00:38] sunileif: idk theres like 9 unfinished BGs that will never see the ight of day
[8:00:45] Thoreya: sorry people like 5 player content more than raid LUL
[8:00:51] sunileif: sounds like BGs were important at one point
[8:01:01] Landrysdad: @thoreya that’s doesn’t mean it’s good. mythic plus is absolute dog shit
[8:01:03] avenueone: pvp was meant to be enjoyed by a rogue ganking u thats 10 levels higher than u while u were levelling questing IMO
[8:01:16] Thoreya: @Landrysdad LUL LUL
[8:01:25] sunileif: @avenueone i did this in vanilla <,<
[8:01:35] TheEyeVII: the core of his arguement is he's a narcissist self-centered around his own selfish pov (he doesnt play the game anymore) so he's a doom&gloom hate watching for wow, disgusting imo
[8:02:37] Ronsimus: @theeyevii what a stupid thing to say

[8:02:45] Thoreya: im out though, everyone loves him and i get it, but i think a lot of his points are coming from an old man yells at cloud perspective. he wants things to go back to how they were 20 years ago and it will never happen. he just continues to cry and will never understand things need to change
[8:02:47] avenueone: if u kept the 1st part of that out woulda been fine
[8:03:01] crazzbez: you need to ask yourself, and be extremely honest with yourself, if arena wasn't prioritized over BGs, would wow have even survived for this long in the first place
[8:03:26] peacant: he is saying things as matter of fact
[8:03:47] shugguls: its like when and how he says "true" it stated as a fact
[8:03:54] sunileif: @crazzbez ye speople love that tribes 64 v 64 style of play
[8:04:06] Landrysdad: Arena is 90% of what I do in wow, but I think it’s inevitably bad for the game
[8:04:31] magusfree: think this guy has overplayed the wow is shit argument. cheap jabs to get clicks at this point
[8:04:35] HolyPalaTV: yes
[8:04:35] shugguls: do it
[8:04:35] addyz0r: no

[8:04:51] avenueone: u should alrdy be gone
[8:05:03] crazzbez: @Landrysdad by that do you mean if arena was removed tomorrow you'd still play
[8:05:26] avenueone: suni is the reason ur sick
[8:05:35] Landrysdad: @crazzbez I would play SoD

[8:06:39] pottoman: jesus
[8:06:41] avenueone: suni made mes do a mile high shoey on the plane while bricked up
[8:06:55] TheEyeVII: he never had any issues getting carried through any & all content, including arenas/m+/raids & never had these takes while streamin' retail mostly, obviously all of it is subjective but his way of communicating is obnoxious & he resonates in absolutes, not a fan
[8:07:13] sunileif: @avenueone correction the mile high shoey made him bricked up
[8:10:38] 34chev: are you using the 4 set on ret ?
