[3:15:22] Gorestack: no fresh servers is so stupid ffs
[3:15:28] dozilla: Flyers clarifications too
[3:15:29] Tigerklaue: everyone would play on the fresh server and they would crash
[3:15:47] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I think Blizz is anticipating a drop-off like in Vanilla so they don't want to have too many servers for the lulls.
[3:15:47] Dinosew: Is Sam Didier still at Blizzard
[3:15:53] Alvari: blizzconline was pretty meh

[3:16:35] Gorestack: D2 hellll yeah, that looks like a proper remaster
[3:16:38] atherieel: @towelliee I doubt those questions were screened since DisDik got to ask 1 haha
[3:16:40] Apokolipz: i wanna play d4 rogue
[3:16:50] Ulandaz: the content for 9.1 looks good for what we can see of it, just not enough
[3:16:54] Meliea_EU: never take any oil based pharmacy, there is always better options like rose hip powder for the skin
[3:16:55] sinlesssinner: 40$ tho for D2..
[3:16:56] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Honestly I kinda wish they announced mergers for some servers on the BC end.
[3:16:58] MOLAR305: didn't sound convincing that may June is timeline for 9.1
[3:17:01] Tigerklaue: hint would spoiler the sylvanas fight
[3:17:11] kodtheog: yeah we didnt even get a timeline of 9.1 at all makes me feel like its not even close
[3:17:12] ShieldslamTV: @sinlesssinner Worth it
[3:17:13] dutchie76: 9.1 in July imo
[3:17:14] GorSTL: D2 was way better than i thought it was going to be
[3:17:16] SilkeySmooth: expect a long content drout like wod longe..lol
[3:17:22] Eikus11: the price tag for D2 is a bit crazy
[3:17:24] Infinitepeeep: streamer luck
[3:17:29] dutchie76: 9.1 is more far off than people think
[3:17:30] primalistion: true, its annoying but cant blaim them uncurtain times
[3:17:35] HaloS23: @Towelliee so you figure they will have a "normal" virtual one in Nov?

[3:19:37] monute316: to baby shark music
[3:19:46] reinhardtdog: They kind of reminded me of the classic talent builds of wow
[3:19:51] rocthenite: it that good ol tigle doing his magic
[3:19:56] SlowpokeIsAGamer: It's insane, and also just another sad indictment of the WoW team.
[3:20:02] Rudric_Ice: BTW did alex afirasabi leaave blizzard ? he basically handed the lore stuff
[3:20:12] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Yeah, the PVE stuff is gonna be great. It's gonna be like Destiny 2 meets Diablo 3
[3:20:17] Maex: @Towelliee but its it really better then the other trinkets ?
[3:20:23] Bacanu34: 4k anima NotLikeThis me with 200 anima BibleThump
[3:20:36] Maex: @Towelliee cuz i got it 2o3
[3:20:36] raufftb: Why are your rio so low?
[3:20:39] silverknight16: The blizz braindrain is real.
[3:20:56] BlueBeast33: Btw, the question about fresh servers was only about Classic, not TBC. I just looked at it again.
[3:21:12] Mr_Pennywise_: :P
[3:21:14] Mr_Pennywise_: :p
[3:21:31] Mecabeast: i want to join the pirate dragon covenant, where do i apply
[3:21:38] dutchie76: nope
[3:21:47] desmo7: @BlueBeast33 nah was TBC, she said for TBC launch there will be no fresh servers
[3:21:55] yerdlethespaceturtle: when does season 2 start?
[3:21:59] Demanisraar: Late June
[3:22:01] SlowpokeIsAGamer: 9.1 is a lot like Shadowlands in general so far. It has stuff that seems like it could be cool but it just doesn't come together well.
[3:22:06] board4life65: end of june
[3:22:09] akia03: didnt they say really soon after 9.0.5
[3:22:13] CaseysOn: They said Spring, June 20 is the end of spring.
[3:22:16] dutchie76: after July 4th
[3:22:18] HoppsiDejsi: He said Next month
[3:22:18] CaseysOn: July is Summer
[3:22:25] dutchie76: LUL
[3:22:29] jasperboy: @Towelliee https://i.redd.it/f4l1ward7ni61.jpg
[3:22:29] Kyrrua: they should have delayed blizzcon maybe LUL
[3:22:31] Demanisraar: @Pralice13 9.0.5 not 9.1
[3:22:41] HoppsiDejsi: YEaa thats what i ment
[3:22:43] Seerated: Seerated subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 85 months, currently on a 85 month streak! Gl with Love Rocket this year, got mine finally last. + BC-hyype !!!
[3:22:44] SlowpokeIsAGamer: 9.0.5 they apparently confirmed for "March." So that'll tell us a lot about 9.1 right there, and surprisingly it won't be around 4/13.
[3:22:48] dutchie76: march 15th will probably be 9.0.5
[3:23:07] Crowzcut: mm its ok
[3:23:11] KingSlayerYotam: soda stopped watching mid qna
[3:23:12] Tayve_: it's legit the old school wow talents
[3:23:19] dutchie76: yea
[3:23:26] firebombdk: it star war
[3:23:29] Keyastaron_: MNARCH 16th
[3:23:30] xideontv: well, OW director is old school WoW designer
[3:23:31] dutchie76: errr 16th sorry lol
[3:23:35] dutchie76: my b
[3:23:35] dergNwolf: this WoW interview was the most frustrating shit ever
[3:23:52] dergNwolf: or not interview but Q&A
[3:23:59] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Except these talents do more than just "1-5% crit" They do stuff like Junkrat can dual wield grenade launchers. Reinhardts firestrike now freezes enemies.
[3:24:10] MrGattz: i wouldnt say it was frustrating, just disappointing
[3:24:11] Plague_GG: that weapon enchant slootGasm
[3:24:12] SlowpokeIsAGamer: The WoW Q&As are always frustrating because they're so clearly curated.
[3:24:28] dutchie76: lol
[3:24:32] BlueBeast33: @desmo7 I'll have to hear her answer again, but the question itself was about Classic.

[3:24:41] x_Davincii: yay! i got gifted while i was afk, thank you! @Sarcastard
[3:24:46] Kyrrua: I saw the infamous "waste of time" customization question HAHA LUL
[3:24:56] N3llee: this entire blizzcon was disappointing.. it was like a patch reveal stream
[3:24:58] dutchie76: 16th
[3:24:59] N3llee: not a blizzcon
[3:25:01] dutchie76: i meant
[3:25:10] dutchie76: well see
[3:25:11] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I'd say 9th yeah.
[3:25:17] KingSlayerYotam: "is this an out of season april fools joke"
[3:25:17] PokerFaceMoose: beware the ides of march
[3:25:19] Tayve_: new patch is tuning and valor right?
[3:25:19] allisonkielle: He Knows
[3:25:22] Kyrrua: they always pick the "will there be more customization question every year
[3:25:28] akia03: blizcon might aswel just been a wowhead post with the stuff we heard
[3:25:44] N3llee: yep
[3:25:49] Merzerker: are there any good educated guesses online for when TBC releases?
[3:25:52] pomopave: what class should i try out in classic tbc? :P
[3:25:55] woodchuck91: new stuff Kappa
[3:26:02] allisonkielle: straight up tilted that tier wont come back till 9.2
[3:26:05] fans30: And we wonder why wow is going downhill
[3:26:06] MrGattz: oh cool
[3:26:07] allisonkielle: I want it now =(
[3:26:12] BigBOBO: they just said 9.0.5 is next month so we gotta wait 2+ months for 9.1
[3:26:15] SlonkiJippi: why does it say classic prep leveling when you're on retail
[3:26:16] Tayve_: it would have been good to get a flythrough of the new zone or mega-dungeon
[3:26:17] Kinghorn: lindsey sterling is great
[3:26:21] BigBOBO: they have no clue what they're doing yet :D
[3:26:22] SlowpokeIsAGamer: 9.0.5 being in March is the bigger timeline breaker for 9.1. That means the PTR won't be up until probably mid-late March, and then a full testing cycle after that. May at the earliest now for 9.1.
[3:26:28] lithium364: at which time will they decide for an 2021 blizzcon end of this year?
[3:26:31] A_New_Challenger: whoa - gotta check out lindsey sterling...I am pretty sure you know who she is

[3:26:35] griffdog125: lindsey sterling is an awsome violin player/edc dancer
[3:26:40] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I just want them to still have attunements in BC Classic. At least until the final phase.
[3:26:43] TheCliffyShow: Lindsey Sterling is a bomb ass violin player that played Blizzcon a few years ago. Great performance that was. Not sure who the dude is
[3:26:51] MrGattz: lindsey stirling is an absolute beast
[3:26:53] Tidus99: come on towelliee you half to no who Lindesey sterling is if u heard her songs you would reconize her
[3:26:59] A_New_Challenger: Like you have heard her music, but don't remember or didn't know
[3:27:16] TheCliffyShow: I kinda wanna watch the Lindsey performance from a few years ago.
[3:27:17] Tidus99: she dancing violin girl
[3:27:17] MrGattz: he knows who she is for sure
[3:27:30] Kromede: PepeWhy towUnforch
[3:27:40] Uutef: end tomorrow
[3:27:43] pokerigo: Goddamn lol
[3:27:45] MrGattz: maybe tomorrow
[3:27:47] A_New_Challenger: Yea - just wait for the show
[3:27:48] YardRage: Metallica LUL
[3:27:52] Redn3ckHippie: towUnforch
[3:27:59] blucifer1320: In 2.4.3 they didn’t have attune, they were still there but none were needed if I remember @towelliee
[3:27:59] Nalleys: LUL
[3:28:00] YardRage: Lars had it coming
[3:28:03] iiWolfyyy: lmfao
[3:28:07] lithium364: people got banned LUL
[3:28:09] Kriven: @YardRage not true
[3:28:09] A_New_Challenger: I bet it will be a good show
[3:28:12] Innkkeeper: wow
[3:28:16] stallowned: KEKW
[3:28:58] Kinghorn: if they dump attunements they might as well not release it
[3:29:02] BlueBeast33: Makes no sense to launch with pre-nerf bosses but not attunements
[3:29:05] SlowpokeIsAGamer: They definitely stripped out the Kara attune IIRC. At some point I know they killed Hand of A'dal. And SWP didn't even have a traditional attunement it just had gating.
[3:29:12] chrslp: Am I the only one that enjoyed Isle dailies and am looking forward to the return of it? LUL
[3:29:22] Shakalu1990: @Towelliee I'm sending you all my luck for today, go get that mount :) I'm sure it will drop in the next 3 runs.
[3:29:37] MrGattz: ah yes, the good ol rep gate
[3:29:44] blucifer1320: Don’t forget the tainted core macro LUL
[3:30:04] chrslp: I liked the attunement aspect
[3:30:16] Supers18: Kinda weird how they dumped all attunements in wrath
[3:30:17] blucifer1320: Remember you need 300fishing to fish up lurker
[3:30:26] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Those attunement and rep gates kept me going in BC. I wasn't even a raider.
[3:30:40] chrslp: They removed them when more and more people started complaining iTs tOO hArD
[3:30:40] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[3:30:40] MrKhanes: cant say i agree with that, I like how the phases are now for tbc
[3:30:44] Redn3ckHippie: towUnforch
[3:30:47] Queenleaf: good evning
[3:30:54] silverknight16: If I recall, Kael wasn't killed before being nerfed.
[3:30:59] Meshindale: @Towelliee thanks goodnesssss there's no world buffs in bc
[3:31:18] NickLeonhearth: agreeing with staysafe on anything....uf
[3:31:19] MrKhanes: same here @towelliee I dont agree either with Staysafe
[3:31:21] chrslp: I really hope they keep that because thats what TBC was. That was the experience
[3:31:25] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Cut-throat players might chew up Phase 1 fairly quickly, but with how many players I've seen single out Kara as the big reason they wanted BC back, I think people will be satisfied running Kara for 2-3 months.
[3:31:35] stallowned: i think kara,mag gruul is enough at launch, theres a bunch of rep grinds to do also
[3:31:40] Puikka: @towelliee what are your thoughts about 9.1 shadowlands update?
[3:31:45] iiWolfyyy: TRUE
[3:31:48] N3llee: i think it just depends on the tuning of classes, bosses, etc how hard things will be cleared
[3:31:51] UdontGetToQuit: exaclty Thank you towelliee
[3:31:55] lithium364: when was kazzak up as a worldboss in bc?
[3:32:07] iiWolfyyy: content does come knocking, gotta make that shit.
[3:32:09] blucifer1320: Lol
[3:32:13] iiWolfyyy: doesnt *
[3:32:17] StraightErro: I got into a raiding guild cuz I went through the effort to get attuned to Serpentshrine Cavern, and they were looking for people, been with them ever since

[3:33:31] wetttnine: Mining / Herb
[3:33:33] silverknight16: Druids are great famers.
[3:33:34] shadowmoonsmile: herb yes skining no
[3:33:36] silverknight16: farmers*
[3:33:39] Kinghorn: they didnt mention world bosses
[3:33:40] TheBeastofCaerBannog: so if you have a classic character you get a free 58 BC if you want it?
[3:33:41] SlowpokeIsAGamer: No just mentioned raiding.
[3:33:43] spekktrum19: @towelliee wasn’t he in hellfire peninsula in the northern part where you ported to from isle for sun well?
[3:33:44] Kinghorn: onyxia isnt a world boss
[3:33:48] autotune_wow: you can pick up profs in Bloodhoof
[3:33:53] icemanj99: oh man, old school swift flight form quest Kreygasm
[3:34:05] Kinghorn: swift flight form quests wasnt in at launch
[3:34:06] Kman3107: Mining is better than skinning for druids
[3:34:06] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Yeah if you want authentic Fel Reaver you'll have to hit the Classic button.
[3:34:09] Demanisraar: 640x480 LUL
[3:34:26] blucifer1320: Gathering professions on mains are for shitters in BC, remember you get bonuses for the other profs
[3:34:29] RobNXS: Just bring back my key ring so I can see all my attunements lol
[3:34:29] sprert: Also the shaking ground is a really strong indicator that you are about to get fel reavered
[3:34:29] TheGaoSora: But skinning is faster
[3:34:34] Reydien: "Doom Sign!"
[3:34:45] YardRage: towUnforch
[3:34:46] silverknight16: The Fel reaver sound effect scares the shit out of me to this day.
[3:34:50] MOLAR305: that +herbalism racial for tauren
[3:34:51] Armdel: and then you got surround sound heatsets so you know exactly what direction he is coming from
[3:34:58] chrslp: Void reaver was terrifying LUL
[3:35:10] Warwick317: I bet on feralina server theres going to be a war in Hell fire
[3:35:10] DecayedmiNt: Wonder if people will complain that there's multiple Fel Reavers in HF
[3:35:17] Warwick317: during launch
[3:35:21] Homestartv: His damage done was nerfed
[3:35:24] Demanisraar: He got me once... played on a shitty laptop back then with a 14'' scren
[3:35:27] sprert: and don'T forget: the fel reaver is part of an attunement
[3:35:32] Meshindale: @Towelliee they should adapt to the modern resolution and make him..like appear out of nowhere to give that same sense of scare and shock
[3:35:34] Dundin92: His threat radius was nerfed.
[3:35:37] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee they need to reduce his body pull Kappa
[3:35:38] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Probably was nerfed as part ofthe attunement prune.
[3:35:39] sprert: you need him for the shattered halls key

[3:36:50] leftyfriz: @Towelliee Hello

[3:36:50] Meshindale: @Towelliee they should adapt to the modern resolution and make him..like appear out of nowhere to give that same sense of scare and shock
[3:36:54] Ziyololx: someone else can open it
[3:36:55] Wildside1177: Yiu did. You got a mold from a blacksmith outside the Black Temple
[3:36:55] Kman3107: I think you needed it's corpse. Didn't have to actually kill it.
[3:36:57] Kinghorn: yeah its just to open the gate
[3:37:00] Kinghorn: like the scholo key
[3:37:05] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee you have to destroy a fel reaver

[3:38:38] c4mmweir: Can anyone join the classic guild?
[3:38:40] Anguyen92ab: There's a 58 boost?
[3:38:42] akia03: shame i cant transfer my still 60 vanilla char to classic
[3:38:59] Anguyen92ab: If so, sold. I like BC zones and the leveling.
[3:39:19] ArcaneMaki: Yeah. Mind your own business and let other play how they want to play
[3:39:25] desmo7: or copy
[3:39:32] MOLAR305: no he means retail 60
[3:39:33] 1nc1nerated: The problem is that several servers need to be merged. Stalagg is dead as fuck already and 90% of the players are transferring come TBC
[3:39:33] TheNautican: nah he means from actual vanilla, not on the classic servers probably
[3:39:37] Kyrrua: it was a given the lvl 58 boost would happen, blizzard would never let such easy money slip
[3:39:51] c4mmweir: What realm are you on in classic
[3:39:52] roeddogg: when is the next round of guild invites going out?
[3:39:58] Kyrrua: even if we do a 1million signing against it will remain
[3:40:08] gravess_66: I wish they made the boost available now
[3:40:15] pokerigo: Mhmmm spaghetti
[3:40:19] dirtydavexoxo: Everyone just buy mage boosting anyway
[3:40:24] SlowpokeIsAGamer: BC has 5 billion times more retention power than Vanilla. Or honestly even Shadowlands.
[3:40:41] sprert: they could even link the boost to a 6 oder 12 onth subscription like with diablo 3
[3:40:44] TheNautican: can't wait to rogue evasion tank once again
[3:40:54] Kyrrua: no world buff meta
[3:40:57] Anguyen92ab: I want to go back to Kara
[3:41:05] stallowned: more alt friendly also
[3:41:10] zal_63: yup
[3:41:11] Zavier420: Just think of all the BC attunements...

[3:41:54] Choderz: Choderz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 45 month streak! god we are a bunch of sexy mofos
[3:42:03] Naganick: @Towelliee the 1 time boost is free
[3:42:03] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I might honestly start grinding a Horde character just to garner some gear for my BElf.
[3:42:06] TheItalianStallion321: @Towelliee do you think they will give us like a month to level up our Blood elves?
[3:42:07] Kinghorn: towMath
[3:42:13] BandoTN: wait so its just gonna be 6o to 70 not start from scratch??
[3:42:19] akia03: @Naganick no cost money
[3:42:22] MrGattz: no way
[3:42:27] MrGattz: it would never be free
[3:42:28] Anguyen92ab: No way that's free.
[3:42:28] blucifer1320: ATVI $101USD/share today, wait until tomorrow and see if that moves at all now that all the announcements are out.
[3:42:30] iiWolfyyy: no its not free
[3:42:34] gidgeet: but I want a Blood Elf Hunter ;)
[3:42:34] Naganick: @Towelliee the red head saidf it in the thingy yesterday
[3:42:36] Choderz: 100% cost money and you only get one per account
[3:42:39] BandoTN: oh thank the fucking lord
[3:42:40] Nalleys: Didnt they literally say it was gonna cost a fee
[3:42:49] Naganick: @Towelliee for the dual copy
[3:42:56] ZonnyArk: no fresh servers DansGame
[3:43:03] Clicklesly: Fee/free, basically the same thing Kappa
[3:43:05] Xannah08: the economy is going to suck
[3:43:12] MrGattz: no
[3:43:13] chrslp: The official TBC announcement says it will be paid for
[3:43:14] Naganick: @Towelliee well i am an idoit then
[3:43:16] gravess_66: yes
[3:43:16] Kinghorn: chat
[3:43:17] KylerNA: No no if you copy your character
[3:43:21] KylerNA: to send one to BC and one to classic
[3:43:23] Ziyololx: no if you clone your character
[3:43:24] 1nc1nerated: if you want to do both classic and tbc you have to pay
[3:43:26] Choderz: If you want to play the same character on both servers you have to pay
[3:43:26] MrGattz: if you want your character to exist on BOTH classic and tbc you have to pay
[3:43:28] desmo7: if you want to keep your char on both you pay
[3:43:30] gravess_66: copy your toon cost money
[3:43:32] stallowned: the copy to stay on both costs i think
[3:43:35] SlowpokeIsAGamer: If you want a character in BOTH versions at once it has a fee. If you want to just stay Classic or just go BC it's free.
[3:43:35] MrGattz: if you want to just move on to tbc its free
[3:43:37] akia03: if you want both classic and tbc on same char is going to cost a fee
[3:43:37] Clicklesly: There is a fee to copy, but you can transfer for free
[3:43:38] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I wasn't sure if the fee was to keep both characters on vanilla and TBC or if there's a fee even if you just play on TBC only
[3:43:39] Stangin2122: The fee is only if you want to play both TBC and Vanilla
[3:43:41] Warwick317: u pay if your clone i think boost is free for those with out a 60
[3:43:42] silverknight16: Sounds like you choose which character goes where,a nd if you want to move it to the other option (BC > Classic or Classic > BC) you have to pay to clone it.
[3:43:45] Durithane: no only if you co to BC and keep the same toon on clasasic
[3:43:50] iiWolfyyy: pay a fee to use a clone of your main in classic
[3:43:55] ScytaleTv: if you want same toon for tbc and classic there is a fee
[3:43:59] iiWolfyyy: if it moves to bc
[3:44:05] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee do you have to sell the mats to vendors or AH them
[3:44:21] SlowpokeIsAGamer: God flying only at 70. Some people who have only played post-BC are gonna be shocked by that.
[3:44:24] Anguyen92ab: So, basically what Blizzard will do is keep Vanilla content as it is, and BC at the same time?
[3:44:37] iioanin: pandaria music always hits home :)
[3:44:44] wetttnine: if theyre keeping classic servers what content will they have? @Towelliee
[3:44:47] Kinghorn: it is free
[3:44:48] SlowpokeIsAGamer: You don't have to pay if you want to stay in Classic.
[3:44:49] MrGharr: only pay if you want both
[3:44:49] KylerNA: NOOOOO. YOu only pay if you want to do BC and Classic era.
[3:44:50] desmo7: no.. it is free
[3:44:51] gravess_66: you have to pay if you want both
[3:44:56] Kinghorn: if you want your character on BOTH
[3:44:58] Kinghorn: you pay
[3:45:00] SlowpokeIsAGamer: It's only paid if you want to clone your character to be in Both BC and Classic.
[3:45:02] Ziyololx: its only if you want to clone the character and have it on both
[3:45:13] blucifer1320: Epic flying was 1200
[3:45:22] Mystirose: you pay for clone. so you can have your toon on classic and BC
[3:45:22] blucifer1320: The mounts were expensive
[3:45:22] RicardoFilipe92: So, i dont have a char in classic, do i have to pay to get a 58?
[3:45:23] shadowmoonsmile: i agree 100 %
[3:45:23] Kinghorn: epic was 5k my dude
[3:45:24] MrGattz: staying in classic is free. moving on to tbc is free. staying in BOTH classic and tbc you have to pay
[3:45:36] iioanin: @wetttnine In theory there is no new content apart from the yearly events like christmas etc
[3:45:37] Kinghorn: normal flying was 1k
[3:45:40] happybooger: he did about the lip smacking
[3:45:42] sprert: normal flying is 800g and epic flying is an additional 5000g
[3:45:43] Vanhoek: Have you decided what server is going to be your home for TBC?
[3:45:44] Kyrrua: still should be free tho
[3:45:46] Colt_Engineer: lol
[3:45:52] br0fest0r: That lip smack though
[3:46:01] happybooger: new colors was about the reskin for the pvp mounts

[3:46:50] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Blizz just posted the press kit a day early.
[3:46:57] Revelations45: 12 hours
[3:47:03] Keyastaron_: jesus christ
[3:47:04] DallTV_: @Revelations45 is alive now =D nice =D
[3:47:11] burty_burt69: Blizzcon was BAD
[3:47:15] Keyastaron_: hello @Revelations45
[3:47:18] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Gotta love how Metallica got trending because of everyone playing dumb music over their concert.
[3:47:22] olihob: thats deadly
[3:47:33] Revelations45: Blizzbar was not bad at all unlike Blizzcon
[3:47:36] Broomba: @towelliee what server is your guild on classic on for BC?
[3:47:39] burty_burt69: i think after Classic WOTLK my wow days are gonna be over :(
[3:47:48] RecklessMoviez: @Towelliee when can we start to level a Bloodelf? do we got a date for that
[3:48:05] baaronthemonk: Wandavision is way better than I thought it would be
[3:48:20] TheCliffyShow: Damn, Ulduar was such a great raid.
[3:48:23] Thoreya: im gonna play the shit out of wrath
[3:48:49] Kyrrua: Shadowmourne EZ
[3:48:58] crashoverride_gaming: I can do bs but I don’t know if I can do wrath all over again....
[3:48:58] MrGattz: yeah whenever prepatch is
[3:48:59] olihob: was prot as disliked in arena back then as it is today?
[3:49:02] aduuuxd: will they make wrath tho
[3:49:05] crashoverride_gaming: Bc*
[3:49:13] Kyrrua: can't wait for ret paladin et DK to destroy every other classes ...
[3:49:14] StraightErro: @Towelliee You'll play till you get Herald of the Titans again and call it a day?
[3:49:14] gravess_66: and seal of blood to help population
[3:49:16] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I do love them allowing us to do that early. Means we might actually get groups on them.
[3:49:25] Supers18: @ibangedaqt_ It will fall over they r removing the pushback mechanic as said at blizzcon
[3:49:32] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee you think they will also come out with WOTLK , CATA servers?
[3:49:41] undisputedmoe: !cam
[3:49:42] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[3:49:46] GenMysters: @Towelliee What attempt is this one LOL
[3:50:05] blucifer1320: Wrath was when they changed ret/prot to melee stats and it spell power right?
[3:50:07] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I'm legit curious how Seal of Blood will change the faction balance. I honestly think Alliance might stay dominant because people won't want to re-roll now.
[3:50:19] Ishva: yeah i think it was a 3 second interrupt
[3:50:25] blucifer1320: Instead of spell power*

[3:51:05] Rensiur: I loved my moonkin in late TBC and Wrath - teh Lazer Owl and Treehealer was just so nice to paly
[3:51:13] Keyastaron_: AGI DansGame
[3:51:15] Clicklesly: But Prot mostly wanted SoV anyway iirc at least in Wrath iirc and Ret was in a really poor spot still even with SoB
[3:51:32] Zyvuun: Oh man, you'll have to calculate Uncryshable again
[3:51:36] Keyastaron_: Meta sickets etc
[3:51:39] Zyvuun: er Uncrushable
[3:51:43] Kyrrua: everyone will want to level blood elf or boost lvl 58, even in the past without boost blood elf became most played. Don't underestimate people's passion for cuteness skins or having racial advantage
[3:51:54] Dkgungo: back when jc actually made you gold
[3:51:56] aftoooo: meta gems
[3:51:56] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Back when gem color meant something.
[3:51:57] stallowned: stam stacking POGGERS
[3:52:07] TheCliffyShow: That was also when you had to match socket and gem colors.
[3:52:13] blucifer1320: Gotta get 400 def
[3:52:14] LSBreed: epic gems from bosses
[3:52:15] Ziyololx: Mp5 PogChamp
[3:52:29] Kyrrua: back when the game was an rpg
[3:52:33] akia03: bc had the meta head gems right
[3:52:43] blucifer1320: It’s 400 defense rating
[3:52:45] TheCliffyShow: I made quite a bit from tips for cutting gems in BC
[3:52:48] Clicklesly: Doesn't the macro for Uncrushable work too?
[3:52:49] Zavier420: @Towelliee Isn't that the old site where you and Lore went back and forth?

[3:54:27] Evi_lynn: ohhhh the grind for the netherwing drake mounts. Thing took ages it seemed to get rep for.
[3:54:29] LSBreed: info!

[3:57:07] Traxacon: WHAT HAPPENED TO TBC PREP?
[3:57:07] AgentWhiskeyy: You going to play burning crusade classic?
[3:57:13] SlowpokeIsAGamer: The game itself will be free Asap.
[3:57:16] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Wel lfree with the sub.
[3:57:21] vurax1: @AsapHarlem u dont buy it u can play if u got a sub.
[3:57:24] zGrimm_: @AsapHarlem It should be free along with a regular wow sub
[3:57:31] AsapHarlem: oh thought blizz was going to try milk us as per
[3:57:36] Evi_lynn: well back then no one had cool flying mounts because we spent all our cash on the generic epic flyer. I remember engineers had cool boot modifications I think also. @Kyrrua
[3:57:50] Traxacon: Is spell batching currently in classic I know it was taken out on the ptr but is that build pushed yet?
[3:57:58] BWILDPOKER: will everyone grt to keep there gold from classoc
[3:58:19] SlowpokeIsAGamer: BC engineers had the best mounts because it was the dang helicopter. If you had the epic heli you were the coolest guy in Shattrath.
[3:58:24] AirmVn: there's a difference between 5k and 50k
[3:58:27] Kinghorn: yeah epic flying was rare
[3:58:31] Kinghorn: normal flying was needed
[3:58:36] sprert: normal flying is really easy to get
[3:58:42] MOLAR305: the hardest part was buying the actual full speed mount lol
[3:58:49] Evi_lynn: I'm pretty sure we got flying at 68
[3:58:53] sprert: quests give more gold at max level
[3:59:00] BWILDPOKER: did they give an estimated release date for tbc
[3:59:04] Kinghorn: druid get flight form at 68 @Evi_lynn
[3:59:08] Kinghorn: everyone else is 70
[3:59:16] SlowpokeIsAGamer: 2021. At this point it sounds like sometime in the summer for launch.
[3:59:17] Meshindale: @Towelliee is there a gold cap that can be brought over? sorry if this has already been asked
[3:59:42] BWILDPOKER: is 9.0.5 a new raid?
[3:59:54] Evi_lynn: @Kinghorn I think you are right.
[3:59:59] daearthchild: Nope 9.1 has the raid
[4:00:29] blucifer1320: They might be hedging quarters also because of the Covid crap. So each quarter would be carried by a release of something.
[4:00:34] Reydien: if Season 1 is 24 weeks, that would put the end at like may 18th
[4:00:38] Aidler: they said ptr for 9.1 starts right when 9.0.5 is out
[4:00:41] blucifer1320: Putting 9.1 at sept
[4:00:50] SilkeySmooth: yea end of june start of july
[4:00:51] BWILDPOKER: I wish we started fresh on tbc with no gold
[4:01:00] alirezavtp: yo dude i just wanted to start playing shadowlands after a long time should i start with tbc since i just played tbc a couple years ago
[4:01:20] SlowpokeIsAGamer: May 18th sounds about right for 9.1 at this point. BCC probably in July/August at this point, though they might do pre-patch early just to get BElves/Draenei leveling.
[4:01:30] blucifer1320: Then BC would be august/sept
[4:01:33] burty_burt69: ewww i hate shadowlands :(
[4:01:52] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee it does
[4:01:59] BWILDPOKER: yeah I'm bored with sl
[4:02:02] alirezavtp: @burty_burt69 why is that
[4:02:06] blucifer1320: What does your guild ideally need @towelliee

[4:02:12] Wedgeh: Steam already has PS5 pad settings
[4:02:14] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i think you just plug it in with steam running and it should do its thing
[4:02:27] blucifer1320: I raided with riggins through BC
[4:02:32] Zansteh: mage?
[4:02:35] blucifer1320: I was a shadow/holy
[4:02:54] blucifer1320: No go Druid for sure
[4:03:04] Dewydrip: is resto druid good in tbc
[4:03:04] CrunkyBrewster: paladin got better around last patch i would say
[4:03:06] EllisTheMenace1: was rogue good in tbc?
[4:03:23] blucifer1320: Druid tanks op in BC
[4:03:27] crashoverride_gaming: Definitely going feral in bc
[4:03:45] gutovisky_: best class in classic ?
[4:03:56] BWILDPOKER: I hope they don't keep the unbalanced tuning
[4:04:04] blucifer1320: All of them?
[4:04:17] shimwood: I might go back to Boomy, it seems to be the only class I enjoy playing
[4:04:20] dreamwalker213: @gutolal best in classic is warrior but not BC
[4:04:25] alirezavtp: is shadoelands hard to play for begineers
[4:04:25] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I'm being a boring goober and going BM Hunter. Because I want to level a hunter before they changed pets.
[4:04:25] Broomba: who do we pst for a guild invite on classic TBC server @towelliee
[4:04:35] Rensiur: I remember being totally naive, wanting to play a Retri pala (started playing end of TBC) - untill I switched
[4:04:41] gravess_66: the switching on magtheridons lair
