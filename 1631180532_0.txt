[4:53:59] Moobot: @Aestheticc4 towNut3 Dragonflight Drops launch Nov 15th! Could it be Game Time? Mogs? Mounts? WE GUN FIND OUT towNut3
[4:54:08] Dagomarus: Even its just evokers and gearing them if you actually want to use them
[4:54:12] EKS90_: FF14 works very well on console and with controller support, because of no addons, if wow had less addons, it would be more of a no brain idea.
[4:54:18] untankful: using steamdeck for farming mats or professions on train would be awesome if you could do that with controller support
[4:54:23] MightyBone_Yumuros: will there be a blizzcon this year / next year btw ?
[4:54:27] MightyBone_Yumuros: or is it dead ?
[4:55:02] Decree22: I think blizzcon was canceled this year? or maybe im thinking of last years
[4:55:16] Aidler: @mightybone1 I think next year. mike (blizz ceo) wants to do new blizzcons in the future
[4:55:19] ClockworkZen: they already announced they were too busy for it this year, but I expect it will come back next year. especially iif the microsoft buy goes through
[4:55:44] looney199725: man if they buff bears dps it will rly throw what ppl think meta is on its head
[4:55:48] abracka_: bill gates cardboard cutouts everywhere
[4:55:51] duffluv22: IF it happens
[4:55:57] mavericks312: MS would shit themselves if the deal were to fall thru
[4:56:11] Uglyfoot: Bear is so boring... does it get any better in DF?
[4:56:30] Nokterian: no that will be Phil Spencer Cardboards on Blizzcon
[4:56:30] looney199725: bear has been same for paat 7 years
[4:56:36] EKS90_: @MightyBone1 I have played with people using controller in other mmos, it works fine most of the  time, its just with how reliant wow is on addons not having them on console would be a barrier  of entry, on PC its still fine.
[4:56:44] abracka_: then phil spencer closes the show by singing believe by cher

[4:57:38] KyleEverett: Fury of Nature wasn't doing ANYTHING so they just fixed the bug and nerfed Elune's

[4:59:17] pereadin: i'm sure its intended since rank 3 shouldn't be available till 10.1.5 i think
[4:59:27] pereadin: its only top damage for healers though for the most part
