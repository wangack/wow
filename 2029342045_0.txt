[1:40:57] R_GraM_: yeah NJ and OR
[1:41:04] AlbySmithers: RI too
[1:41:13] Azathoth__: NJ actually has some of the cheapest gas in the mid-atlantic, because they have low gas taxes
[1:41:35] Drpopcorn: so micro distilleries here are getting popular but the ABC laws are really dumb around them.  they can only sell 1.5 ounces to you in a day for consumption on site
[1:41:39] R_GraM_: we do have cheaper gas. big refinery here

[1:57:40] Kewzu: Well, i think it would be the same during non covid. i'm not very sociable outside of work other than gym. So i kinda need the "forced" social aspect of work, and the 20 minutes of walking home after work sort of created a more offical end to the work day

[4:44:45] R_GraM_: paper set
[4:45:01] Kewzu: fair enough, dmgwise on boss seems fair. it's on trash that you fall behind. someof them are easy to spot why, you play a bit more "loyal" in terms of target over choosing to cleave for dps on "wrong" targets or how to say it

[4:55:02] Kewzu: Do you still have the ingame combat log on your char?
[4:58:06] Kewzu: You missed two hc on anub, you did 2x cleave when adds where down. didnt watch feerlina as close
[4:58:24] Kewzu: ofc, just being picky :)
[4:59:00] mudo81: when did you do this run?
[4:59:09] Kewzu: one thing so far, you could perhaps if you trust the tank is that queing your hc/cleave before running iin. a few times nothing qued for first mob
[4:59:53] Kewzu: depends on how scary the trash is, you do wear a bit of leather
[5:00:15] Omnigum: Yea thats gonna put it up a bit, im pretty sure most of ur tanks taunt on fist global with trash mobs (atleast znips tends to do this in gdkps as far as ive noticed).
[5:00:19] Kewzu: but ghouls,acolyte etc dont hit for shit
[5:00:44] Kewzu: not on pull, just en enraged and they should gbe stunned on allies by palas anyhow
[5:01:11] belemrys: yeah as a tank they do
[5:01:46] belemrys: I like taunt on nameplates to see that
[5:02:03] Kewzu: The abba cthat comes next here is a clear example tho, where you play good boy
[5:02:08] Kewzu: and the rest goes to claeve for max dmg

[5:03:22] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[5:04:34] Kewzu: it seems that end of trash you do not swap always over to hc from cleave for last target. very small but yea
[5:05:26] HeliosCirce: what even is the delta between heroic and cleave at 60
[5:05:40] HeliosCirce: like the bonus damage
[5:05:42] Kewzu: na, mostly looking at amount of hc atm. if you say activity is a bit different for you. that perhaps is not what needs to be fixed then. there are always outlayers
[5:05:58] ffz_ttv: A lot of the top heroic strike warriors in the raid are using daggers or 1.5/1.6 weapons on bosses
[5:06:05] Kewzu: This does not count on logs afaik?
[5:06:37] HeliosCirce: still counts for the speed
[5:07:13] Kewzu: one thing i will never really agree with that you do is the overpower useage. but thats a personal preference

[5:08:59] Balruk_: The Iblis dream
[5:09:21] 3j55: compare miss %
[5:09:25] Zerpyy: If they swap weapons around after the pull it wont show in the summary, but if you look at Thaddius Jochem had ~30 more HS than you
[5:10:02] Kewzu: your raw melee dmg is not that hugely different on trash or general.
[5:10:44] 3j55: yea, also slower mh makes life a lot easier with cleave/heroic
[5:11:06] Kewzu: yea amount of casts of melee is strickier to look at
[5:12:32] Kewzu: better gear will give you some Heroics extra ofc. but its a very big %
[5:13:44] Kewzu: your activity is 55% on trash
[5:13:47] Kewzu: which is by far lowest
[5:13:51] Kewzu: of warriors i belive
[5:14:36] Kewzu: i'm not sure how the acivity timer is working 100%, could be that it counts from first cast or amount of cast right away
[5:14:38] parsefsp: parse here ppc, i play thc iblis on loatheb+sapphiron
[5:14:40] Kewzu: so if you open with sunder+melee its less
[5:14:46] 3j55: open with heroic/cleave is important a your oh is always striking at the same time
[5:14:48] ferore_lks: maybe its ping
[5:14:49] Kewzu: instead of hc+sunder
[5:14:59] ferore_lks: just move to Danmark

[5:20:14] Kewzu: i prefered always having more rage to start each pack

[5:25:28] roguebbr: Gday streamer
[5:25:32] HeliosCirce: I def think there are trash where execute is good. I think on the small stuff like the spiders or those mad scientist packs it wouldnt be worth
[5:25:36] Kewzu: But one thingt hat you may not take into account is, on the packs you swap new trinkets in for. you may start that pack with less rage
[5:25:38] Kewzu: to use the trinket on "Pull"
[5:25:45] vooml: Because when you WF proc the exec or the melee, then you get that rage for the next pack
[5:25:54] vooml: Which wasn't the case before, and not the case on alliance
[5:26:06] vooml: Yep
[5:26:15] Kewzu: That has nothing to do with batching tho
[5:26:19] Kewzu: and also it relys on rng
[5:26:38] ArtyomTrityak: So if you have >2k AP with WBs, is BT better than execute right? So you can BT and then go to next pack/mob
[5:27:05] Kewzu: @ArtyomTrityak per rage yes, but it depends on cd on bt but its not that clear
[5:27:05] HeliosCirce: @ArtyomTrityak its better per rage spent, but execute can be more damage per cast
[5:27:08] vooml: Well with the 400ms batching, a WF proc meant 0 rage whereas now you just end up at 50 rage
[5:27:19] Kewzu: if you spend 30 rage for a bt on 100 rage, you may waste rage

[5:29:28] Kewzu: i know you said you didnt wanna use the WA for showing range or not, i liked  using it to really get it in my face if i was failing
[5:30:01] Kewzu: it tells you range / facing so either way you get some indication but that was just something that helped me
[5:30:46] Kewzu: You open here 2-3 times with cleave on singletarget
[5:30:57] HumungaaDungaa: does this guild do split runs to gear up faster?
[5:30:57] Kewzu: but yet again it's nitpicking
[5:31:18] 3j55: only 8 rage difference, if a chance it works is fine
[5:31:29] Kewzu: yea as i said, its nitpicking
[5:32:20] Kewzu: Hows the groups setup btw, do you allow warriors to go imp intercept or imp cleave over imp bs determained on your group?
[5:32:33] 3j55: also you play cleaner, finishing up mobs etc. others always going for cleaves
[5:32:41] 3j55: which if everyone does that is not ideal
[5:33:04] HumungaaDungaa: nice guys finish last

[5:33:29] 3j55: sunder on the 4 pack is most important as well
[5:33:56] Kewzu: It's not always wrong that you are lower on dps, but its still good to know why you are.
[5:34:23] naughtynatexxx: what were ur parses?
[5:34:40] AmiiGDKP: You still need gear bro
[5:34:43] brooch_fan: if it's a badge pull I straight up sunder once tops
[5:34:46] 3j55: 1cpm with chain pulls feels insane low
[5:34:50] Kewzu: i was always top sundererer and i can easily admit that i did some sunders on wrong places that i should not have
[5:34:57] elcapo63: ur the sunder bot, every guild needs one Kappa
[5:35:21] AmiiGDKP: I saw but yeah executing and not having cleave queued running inm
[5:35:25] AmiiGDKP: is the reason
[5:35:36] Kewzu: it's prob one of the bigger reasons yes
[5:35:42] Kewzu: as ami summed it up and i said before
[5:35:59] rah_sheed: but it happens evrey single pull
[5:36:08] rah_sheed: and that is gonna add up
[5:36:48] AmiiGDKP: The rest is lower activity
[5:36:48] ferore_lks: getting HS/Cleave feature on the first OH swing that instalands probably helps with rage etc
[5:36:59] AmiiGDKP: look at your activity
[5:37:02] ferore_lks: what is diff in white miss on trash
[5:37:11] zypzype: dont use drash hes casting demo
[5:38:06] Kewzu: @ferore_lks that would only make a differencein rage, which sure gives a bit more casts but melees are not counted into casts

[5:38:34] Kewzu: This pulled got scuffed, was it the bs cast?
[5:38:44] Kewzu: who does it target
[5:38:46] Kewzu: when it runs in
[5:38:53] Kewzu: yea the paladin in ur group gets aggro
[5:38:59] Kewzu: not the pulling paadin
[5:39:06] Kewzu: thats ur paladin, not the pulling paladin
[5:39:12] Kewzu: wasnt it truelight pulling
[5:39:37] toiletsmuggler: i just blame laty
[5:39:41] HeliosCirce: that was some interesting timing
[5:39:43] Kewzu: it could be battleshout into him buffing or something. but it's prob the bs
[5:39:47] Jugswon1: see the rage go down krille did a shout
[5:39:49] Kewzu: and then he just do something
[5:40:20] Jugswon1: watch the rage on frames
[5:41:10] belemrys: grob throws down slimes
[5:41:18] ferore_lks: your white hit miss % on trash seems to be highest in raid (I sampled 10 warriors), which is probably due to no qued HS/Cleave on opener
[5:41:20] belemrys: so log thinks it is grob
[5:41:22] 3j55: Gromsblood 15g on Alliance firemaw atm if you have any
[5:42:12] Kewzu: if you play that pull more aggrresive you die with that late lip
[5:42:32] parsefsp: a small percentage of it could be valentine 2% hit food aswell
[5:42:46] Kewzu: yea but you do no qued cleave and u could have ww:d pretty much insta :)
[5:43:04] glaciationz: why dont horde q hs cleave on opener but ally do
[5:43:13] Kewzu: you missunderstould what i meant, if mean if you play more aggresive the late lip kills you :)

[5:43:55] Kewzu: i qued on pull as horde as well, i only really speedran as horde. sure i did gdkp and had a well geared allie warrior also but still que on pull on trash that was not 1shot trash
[5:44:02] dubsey1: whos playing sadys? he's kinda farming overall
[5:44:07] 3j55: are you that worried about threat tho, they can taunt and you have full stam buffs/plate
[5:44:10] 3j55: you aren't gonna die
[5:44:34] 3j55: haha
[5:44:42] HeliosCirce: oh boy enforcement
[5:45:05] Kewzu: Why is why queing on pull works as horde also
[5:45:10] HumungaaDungaa: why are they opening with taunt? that doesnt do shit
[5:45:25] Kewzu: @HumungaaDungaa it buys you time to build threat and the mob normally dies withint 1 taunt
[5:45:26] Jugswon1: i see a few warriors use apocalypse legs over carnage (they have both), whats the idea behind that
[5:46:20] ferore_lks: @Jugswon1 pretty sure it sims higher
[5:46:42] Toxiferous: crit is overrated
[5:46:47] Kewzu: Our tanks started with it on horde, they should. The trash dies so fast most times so starting with taunt is fine on horde also on trash.
[5:47:00] dd_lee: So Tetsu is right? plate = DPS hmmMeeting
[5:47:23] HumungaaDungaa: stam is the best stat

[5:48:53] NostalgicDream: itemrack is just so great
[5:49:04] 3j55: how does autoqueue work?
[5:49:12] Kewzu: i know quiet a few very good warriors msotly ran passive trinkets entire nax jsut to focus on playing
[5:49:25] Kewzu: im not hugely inlove with pure relaying on itemque in naxx due to undead/demon
[5:49:29] Kewzu: and timing can be scuffed at times
[5:49:56] brooch_fan: Kissahomie
[5:50:15] ltsrrpp: nah if you have kiss or slayers you gotta use that lmao, so much damage
[5:50:24] brooch_fan: I think it's more nuanced than auto queue since you may need to get kiss on pre-emptively for a boss fight
[5:50:25] ltsrrpp: esp when stacking death wish on trash
[5:50:40] hwl_mansa: can't you run 2x undead trinket
[5:50:43] hwl_mansa: or is dft better
[5:50:44] Wastegates: just get slayers
[5:50:58] Kewzu: trinket is rarely the issue, just saying there was quiet a few top players who mostly relayed dft+naxx trinket. i swapped but only manual since there was a efw times itemracked fucked up
[5:51:38] 3j55: kiss+slayers are the biggest dps increase you can get
[5:52:03] 3j55: can't be using passive trinkets only
[5:52:32] ltsrrpp: what do you guys reck
[5:52:56] ltsrrpp: doing the thaddius buff for saph?
[5:53:20] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[5:53:38] Kewzu: yea ofc you have to have DFT for it, else its shit
[5:53:45] ltsrrpp: and the passives on slayers or kiss is still really good
[5:54:16] Kewzu: its absolute dmg to be gained, i liked doing it. but i knowi did less in our best run due to all other shit to keep track of
[5:55:39] Kewzu: we had targets for each group for speeedruns assgined both for targets and sunders

[5:57:34] 3j55: they enrage under 50% and can slap
[5:57:40] 3j55: so normally pala stun at 50%
[5:57:41] Kewzu: You stun way more on allies due to free paladin stun

[6:07:05] Kewzu: in sometimes it can be good for the raid to prio ww over a sunder on some packs. but yea my main issue when i was raiding was using a bit to much sunders in some places where it was not necessarly correct
[6:07:08] Kewzu: even if they wher effective

[6:07:24] lebishhh: you can tell you are a horde player though mate seems little conservative just send it brother

[6:11:03] Kewzu: sunder is not all either, its about on how early you move away to next group for cleaving and so forth
