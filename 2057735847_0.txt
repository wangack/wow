[7:04:00] lewype: bfd full clear was almost a whole level
[7:04:10] kajjan112: 27k :o
[7:04:20] Vissie13: The BFD boss exp works with rested exp
[7:04:33] Reachhx: does it still give the same exp on higher lvls is the question
[7:05:18] Vissie13: We had a lvl 30 in our raid and he was getting the same experience as our lvl 25s that didn't have rested exp

[7:29:32] bezerka1: can keep sharing after uve got the rune
[7:29:47] bezerka1: nah, the quest remains complete in your quest log
[7:31:28] GooseB27: Why the homies names so weird?
[7:31:29] Delusionxy: have dispersion?
[7:32:38] bezerka1: I would probably suggest running straight ahead into the pool infront of you and going towards the fountain that way
[7:32:58] bezerka1: that way your a closer distance to the mobs and can use the item and loot the object quicker
[7:33:08] bezerka1: its like a 4-5 sec cast time to pickup the iteem you need
[7:33:21] bezerka1: just need to make sure your homies and shadowfiend stay alive long enough to loot
[7:33:21] Devii7: you can just share the q without having the q item?
[7:33:26] Dreameaterz: si
[7:34:03] Dreameaterz: i had a lvl 40 mage try kill me before.. he got dc'd in the wall when i magicly hit fear

[7:36:59] kajjan112: removed stam rightr?
[7:37:10] ama__deus: Yeah
[7:37:17] ama__deus: 20 stam, 12 SP

[7:39:44] Dreameaterz: but gz mate
[7:39:57] classicdeth: niiiice gratz
[7:40:45] cole19: !talent
[7:40:47] the_moist_factory: dispersion so crazy
[7:40:54] rengardlol: is dispersion for healers aswell?
[7:40:58] the_moist_factory: can you use it while stunned?
[7:41:24] ripinpeace10: dispersion with no shadow form is weird
[7:41:35] cadaee: !talents
[7:41:35] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[7:41:47] Zenlyn: if its the same as retail, spirit of the redeemer is a full aggro drop like feign death too
[7:41:56] ama__deus: someone said it got changed to no longer work when stunned. Curious if that was bs or not
[7:41:59] jeffrey_preston_bezos: @Hydramist Do you think they introduce arena in SoD? Would you look forward to that?
[7:41:59] kajjan112: Shadow will be fun
[7:42:14] Zenlyn: hahaha
[7:42:15] cadaee: is the youtube short with the spec in the right one?
[7:42:18] Amexx1: yooo, did you send a 24h?
[7:42:30] Toxiferous: they will never do arena in SoD @jeffrey_preston_bezos
[7:42:30] cadaee: <3
[7:42:45] kajjan112: I'm so confused to how they kept with that rune
[7:42:58] kajjan112: yeah but stll
[7:43:00] kajjan112: so annoying
[7:43:20] ripinpeace10: what would a dungeon healing spec look like
[7:43:23] kajjan112: what slot is spirit?
[7:43:23] cadaee: FK ME SO FAST GAHAHAHA
[7:43:27] cadaee: okay ill spec now :P
[7:43:28] jeffrey_preston_bezos: @Toxiferous how are you so sure about that?
[7:43:43] Toxiferous: they’ve said no arena or rbgs
[7:43:45] Zenlyn: classic vanilla class design and arena do NOT mix
[7:43:59] MVPeteTV: ve+dots is really nice for bouncing pom
[7:44:03] optik_rec0rds: and yet we got shadowstep
[7:44:06] ama__deus: @Zenlyn 1on1 arena would work eShrug
[7:44:18] kajjan112: There should only be rbgs for solo queues
[7:44:40] Stingobee: How do you have enemy health text showing?
[7:44:53] optik_rec0rds: modern targetframe
[7:44:57] Kaekias: whoever said it earlier, you are right. disperse without shadow form doesn't feel right
[7:45:10] ripinpeace10: i never got sear cuz i didnt turn in shipments :(
[7:45:14] cadaee: open your talents on the disc side so I can prt screen :P hahaa
[7:45:17] Toxiferous: 1v1 arena in all wows or just SoD @hydramist
[7:45:18] aeroshail: Ah cmon Hydra Play dragonflight bro. Youtube are better than hiding behind lvl 20 Charakters...
[7:45:29] ama__deus: ngl, sear kinda the worst kind of AOE spell LUL
[7:45:36] optik_rec0rds: dragonflight LUL
[7:45:41] Kaekias: dragonflight is a fucking clusterfuck
[7:45:49] Zenlyn: next time u'll see hydra on retail is MAYBE on next expac release for the hype train
[7:45:49] Shinraxd: was so funny
[7:45:52] cadaee: lemme see disc tree again :O
[7:46:05] Zenlyn: only cos thats when cata comes out LUL
[7:46:17] ripinpeace10: disc in Df is actually lowkey fun ngl @Hydramist
[7:46:33] aeroshail: Everyone checks Hydra everyday to weit Wien he comes back
[7:46:36] Kaekias: i have some fond memories of cata, but apparently pvp was crap (according to hydra) :(
[7:46:44] iqtwohundred: song name?
[7:46:52] Toxiferous: what is up with the names above the homies
[7:47:01] Kaekias: didn't enjoy disc in DF one bit
[7:47:07] Zenlyn: i've had convos with ziqo about hydra's thoughts on cata but they have very differing stories
[7:47:11] Kaekias: stupid dealing dmg to heal is just mental to me
[7:47:16] optik_rec0rds: attunement Pog
[7:47:34] rengardlol: cata hype train
[7:47:35] Dreameaterz: ey man

[7:47:42] ripinpeace10: prime hydra disc vs zen holy who wins

[8:37:44] mfjooones: Druid or warrior? Sånt deck what to level first
[8:37:45] Ak3rf3ldt: Swd is a proper execute
[8:37:49] Saadonis: how did u get dispersion??
[8:37:53] scroteyx: swd is insane but it has double the cd and has a downside
[8:37:55] Toxiferous: guess the gear is cheap but the mounts are the big ticket items
[8:38:04] HunterEZ: Yo ryan whats the spec to go
[8:38:08] HunterEZ: in phase 2

[8:44:13] kajjan112: @Toxiferous if joke, yes. If serious, ofc not
[8:44:14] Kyfoon: you will never catch up
[8:44:38] Toxiferous: Sadge
[8:44:39] ReykooTv: 1-25 gets a 50% xp buff
[8:44:41] kajjan112: p3 around the corner, too late mate
[8:44:58] Kaekias: just skip anything blizz related tbh
[8:45:58] bezerka1: how does cozy sleeping bag work, and is it actually worth getting?
[8:46:20] kajjan112: @bezerka1 I saw a guy in it, but he had 1 stack and it gave 1%xp
[8:46:22] Hanleyy: u can use other ppeoples sleeping bag for buff
[8:46:36] mxborst: you get alot of rested doing the quest line
[8:46:46] kajjan112: I mean, if you afk alot sure
[8:46:48] Brushhopper: it can give up to a 3% exp buff, and doing the quest gives a bunch of items that you can use to gain rested
[8:46:51] Toxiferous: it’ll be worth for P3/4. depends if you’re in a rush
[8:46:51] mopchild: 12 bars of rested
[8:47:10] mxborst: single time use 12 bars
[8:47:14] mopchild: 12 bars
[8:47:17] mopchild: better to keep it for 60

[9:00:25] btrflylol: the bag space is cancer for those quests
[9:00:25] svettsune: oh ye xD
[9:02:29] Creoxx: cucked by pets lul
[9:04:52] nithru: D:
[9:04:56] jeffrey_preston_bezos: Is your rested XP set to hardcore maybe? as it being so aggresive
[9:05:11] Extramediums: they do, same with herbing/mining
[9:05:36] prosa92: Someone hit 40 yet?

[9:05:55] momhips: Just tuned in, have you gotten mind spike yet?
[9:06:11] prodigy_wow: Mind Spike looks super cool
[9:06:18] prodigy_wow: I dont have it
[9:06:20] momhips: I am omw there now, disperse makes me feel like a god
[9:06:32] prodigy_wow: 200 dmg at 40?
[9:06:37] rengardlol: does it remove dorts?
[9:06:48] Dreameaterz: 200 dmg is nothing
[9:06:58] prodigy_wow: I got auto attacked from a warrior for 450
[9:07:00] shrroom: Did you have dispersion on eu?
[9:07:02] shrroom: the quest
[9:07:03] prodigy_wow: he wasnt even 40
[9:07:16] Remaum23: staff dropped in bfd today after like 20 runs
[9:07:16] sulltan95: where did u get disperse from?
[9:07:49] Dreameaterz: i wonder if the quest can be shared to a low lvl?
[9:07:52] Saadonis: which quest for rune?
[9:08:02] icy__xd: What talents are you running for leveling?
[9:08:16] shrroom: That would be great
[9:08:21] shrroom: so much hassle to get that rune
[9:08:41] Dreameaterz: can we test that ryan? not now, sometime?
[9:08:48] holymio: what race for alliance priest? focus pvp, is fearward better than shadow meld overall or would you prefer having it for open world pvp?
[9:09:19] monsterhime: just did disp without quest
[9:09:52] sulltan95: wait what, shadowfiend is not a rune?
[9:10:15] letsgetgoingyo: i feel like starsurge is even crazier this phase
[9:10:43] letsgetgoingyo: im geting two-shot by 800 starsurge crits
[9:11:03] shrroom: Got it <3
[9:11:16] prfdrlol: Deciphered Troll Scroll gives you a Quest that you can share?
[9:11:20] sulltan95: is shadowfiend perma item in ur bags or is it a consumable?
[9:11:25] paxxia: Huh? There is a working addon that shows enemy buffs? What is it called?
[9:11:27] ugyesgyerek: dude, a lvl 40 shadow priest just hit me for 900 death, is that normal?
[9:11:44] the_moist_factory: yes
[9:11:50] Clinch921: you had it on crusader strike eu right?
[9:12:02] philtron69: can someone share the quest for ally on living flame?
[9:12:30] Dreameaterz: i can @philtron69  just drop me a dm, i can do it when im back in SW?
[9:12:33] letsgetgoingyo: you can get 12 slot mageweave bags for 1.8g on AH to help with space
[9:12:53] Zelimeth: the wpvp event is so meh
[9:12:55] Dreameaterz: @philtron69  same name without the z
[9:12:55] onechippy: anyone got it on lone wolf horde eu ?
[9:12:57] Zelimeth: stv event
[9:13:23] Zelimeth: everyone is farming the GY
[9:14:01] bob_the_blob12: still no all universal priest racials?
[9:14:11] ChapoFacade: what server are you on
[9:15:31] letsgetgoingyo: hes lower level so its fair for him to get that cheeky opener
[9:16:19] prodigypt: how man, my surges hit for 300 at lvl 30 bruh
[9:17:19] letsgetgoingyo: @prodigypt 5/5 vengeance gives 100% crit damage bonus. Its so fried
[9:17:20] kajjan112: So i just did stv event.  It's the dumbest shitshow so far. How Blizz manages to make even worse pvp events is beyond me. Somehow they always do.
[9:17:28] conbarz: how does priest feel?
[9:17:38] sulltan95: @hydramist can u explain shadowfiend i saw u used it twice but i dont see u equiping the rune
[9:17:39] kajjan112: Grouping is fked
[9:17:44] kajjan112: turning in spots, is fucked
[9:18:10] kajjan112: Anyone could've seen the GY issue a mile away. They somehow manage not to^^
[9:18:15] Zelimeth: I thought they discouraged grouping too
[9:18:19] Turaxyy: Is there a single pvp event that worked in the history of wow @Hydramist ?
[9:18:25] Turaxyy: I genuily asked myself today
[9:18:28] Turaxyy: I don't recall any
[9:18:38] kajjan112: I just turns into a thing that no one wants to do beyond getting the items.
[9:18:43] holymio: fearward or shadowmeld for pvp (bgs, bit open world)?
[9:19:39] Zelimeth: a BR every 3 hour and u got 3 attempts or smth - make ppl play it srsly
[9:19:44] kajjan112: I thought that was what it was, thats what they told us. But then they do this
[9:20:16] kajjan112: I feel like any Classic fan that knows STV could've done it better
[9:20:39] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[9:21:09] Zelimeth: it's a bit lame. shouldnt be able to grp at least
[9:21:19] teglosu: @turaxyy tol barad wasn’t actually horrible
[9:21:29] sulltan95: shadowfeind seems a bit weaker version than normal no?
[9:21:30] teglosu: but may be recalling it wrong
[9:21:37] Zelimeth: might become normal once ppl got their items
[9:22:51] mopchild: managed to fix the stream sniping stuff then!
[9:22:53] mopchild: nice
[9:23:42] teglosu: actually tol barads event may have been bad but it was a zone that made wpvp more “natural” out of the event
[9:24:03] gamerwatcher77: Did you get mind spike
[9:24:43] letsgetgoingyo: youre too nice. Gnomes deserve to get rekt
[9:25:06] JustOndore: Who you calling dirtbag
[9:25:11] letsgetgoingyo: paladins I agree, they must eat dirt
[9:25:18] NeVolent: untill u fight a good mutilate rogue :p
[9:25:40] kajjan112: How you respect rogues is beyond me
[9:25:51] kajjan112: ezpz class #1
[9:26:13] drishx: What is this hate towards paladins rukiMad
[9:26:18] esponstef: Omw for the disper quest ! 😂
[9:26:35] NeVolent: muti rogue is kinda disgustin atm
[9:26:44] kajjan112: Yeah but they're op as heck in vanilla. Different in SOD ofc
[9:27:23] DrunkComposer: @Hydramist I think ferals will 1 shot in the opener once they get tigers fury rune, what do you think?
[9:27:37] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[9:27:49] gamerwatcher77: did you get mind spike
[9:28:08] perseay797: @DrunkComposer What what? Rake?
[9:28:51] perseay797: With* what
[9:29:22] DrunkComposer: shred
[9:29:39] Dakkroth: noway they dont hotfix this blood moon stuff btw
[9:29:42] Dakkroth: abuse as long as u can
[9:30:30] kajjan112: Idk whether to laugh or cry over blood moon
[9:30:30] Dakkroth: mount if u want it
[9:30:36] perseay797: I thought you can only choose one to equip? @Hydramist
[9:30:39] kajjan112: would be nice if it was something you wanted to do after the farm
[9:30:46] Dakkroth: i thought blood moon was fun tho, b4 the GY stuff
[9:30:55] Dakkroth: but u gotta abuse the GY farm, its 20x more efficient
[9:31:39] bodkinz_: You think mobs should despawn/neutral for opt-ed in players during the event?
[9:32:07] kajjan112: Sorry just annoyed over it.  But how did the make it like this and not realize it was going to happen.
[9:32:08] Zelimeth: random gy spot is a good idea, premades could get split up too
[9:32:16] grenis_: should probably have a spawn protection, like no reward from killing at GY
[9:32:28] Dakkroth: random spawn locations + ress timer
[9:32:33] kajjan112: Feel like anyone could see this coming
[9:32:34] Dakkroth: now its same spot perma insta ress - repeat
[9:32:59] classicdeth: agreed
[9:33:02] sudd7: a 30 sec buff debuff when you rez, making you immune, and not able to attack players
[9:33:09] svettsune: agree
[9:33:11] kajjan112: More BR like would be great. But as we saw in Ashenvale event, there's just too many ppl in one layer
[9:33:53] classicdeth: where do we get the gnomer buff from as horde?
[9:33:56] Dakkroth: but even with this perma GY spam its still 10x better than ashenvale
[9:33:58] Dakkroth: lul
[9:34:16] kajjan112: idk man^^
[9:34:43] kajjan112: atleast its not rubberbanding
[9:34:56] zyl88: how do you think its better? i did the event once, got 13 coins and im done buying items
[9:35:04] MVPeteTV: i thought it was pretty fun
[9:35:27] Fabertastisch: can you show spec?
[9:35:39] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[9:35:50] mopchild: the main issue is
[9:35:57] mopchild: if its that easy to farm all the gear people will stop going
[9:35:59] zyl88: true, i cheesed it. but tbh... im done witht the event
[9:36:03] mokabear: Ryan's a savage...
[9:36:04] kajjan112: managed to get 108 copper coins, thats it. Which is alot if epics are 6s
[9:36:08] mopchild: or do you get AB rep somehow from the event?
[9:36:19] zeyshock: !guide
[9:36:19] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[9:36:23] mokabear: "you should lose all your coins". NOT EVEN HAF. Man wants it ALL
[9:36:30] outofmanax: You should lose your coins on death
[9:36:33] drishx: What can you buy from the event?
[9:36:41] kajjan112: @mopchild You can trade coins for stuff for ab rep yep
[9:36:42] gorglinz: whats broken?
[9:36:52] bodkinz_: exploit early, exploit often
[9:36:58] Fabertastisch: can you show spec?
[9:37:03] ronniejonesx: is it too easy to get rewards or whats going on?
[9:37:14] KN0HP: 100p right
[9:37:16] mopchild: suppose atleast being able to get ab rep from it, it gives you a reason to come back
[9:37:17] mokabear: Yep, it's happened often.
[9:37:31] mokabear: They don't text anything, so they have no clue how it's actually going to be on live.
[9:37:38] mokabear: *test
[9:37:42] Zelimeth: worse or better than ashenvale rn?
[9:37:47] kajjan112: but it also leaves people who didnt manage to do it on time frustrated.
[9:38:09] Dreameaterz: ppl get epic weps for free is a huge deal
[9:38:33] Lothwor: Also not fair loot, physical get epic weps and casters get rings
[9:38:36] mylittlehombre: do ppl already have their epics ?
[9:38:49] Snewch: Yeah bunch of people got their epics
[9:38:53] outofmanax: You should drop all coins on death, should prob be more layers in STV during the event so its not constant kill kill kill kill
[9:38:53] mokabear: Doing good, but missing my homie on Lone Wolf EU...
[9:38:55] bodkinz_: Hydra x Aggrend interview/podcast when?
[9:39:00] Zelimeth: @mylittlehombre ye
[9:39:01] mokabear: KILL HIM YOU COWARD
[9:39:14] kajjan112: @Lothwor thats true
[9:39:28] Zelimeth: no more bryan rampages?
[9:39:47] ronniejonesx: is there a weekly quest for the stv pvp event too where you can get Arathi rep?
[9:40:10] KN0HP: constructive
[9:40:12] Zelimeth: constructive
[9:40:16] kajjan112: overall with phase 2 yes. pvp event sceptical
[9:40:20] baylo: hi
[9:40:21] kaanlu: its a progressive mindset, and every field need those
[9:40:39] kajjan112: I wanna be constructive too but i feel like they miss the mark by soo much
[9:40:54] Kyfoon: i afk'd dead in blood moon event and now cant res
[9:40:57] Kyfoon: very Pog
[9:41:23] kaanlu: what are your thoughts on the blood moon event?
[9:41:25] kajjan112: Well i do remember arena stuff from way back, kept mmr through seasons and stuff^^
[9:41:40] Snewch: Looking at your damage, SWD must do an insane amount in shadowform :O
[9:42:09] Snewch: Time to put the enhance on the bench and level shadow LUL
[9:42:23] vrsswow: So for the first time we gona have Hydra playing shadow :)
[9:42:35] svettsune: just got my dispers :D done with boots
[9:42:39] kajjan112: After all they do release it without betas and stuff so... yea. Overall im having fun
[9:42:46] jinx3r: anyone else see the priest dps in gnomer? early on but kinda pumped
[9:42:55] Geelols: bro i saw a 40spriest death hitting 1200 crits and the animation on mind spike is so dope
[9:43:13] bodkinz_: ttk looks extremely low at 40, no matter gear.
[9:43:50] gegonn1991: @Geelols Hehe nice
[9:44:02] gegonn1991: Good that I have a Balance Druid and a Shadow Priest :D
[9:44:10] akvesic: You got shadowfiend in sm library first boss if you havent already
[9:45:15] vrsswow: hihi i just delited rogue with 2xstarusge crits 700+
[9:45:54] prodigypt: song?
[9:48:06] Kyfoon: poor benseven
[9:48:50] the_moist_factory: what makes you hate lifebloom so much
[9:48:58] kajjan112: Don't forget the dear BM hunts

[9:49:10] bananaeh: did you forget warlocks ryan? :D
[9:49:13] hiraethonhs: u sure? think rogue is broken rn

[9:50:43] Kyfoon: lifebloom was grim in tbc
[9:50:46] openheimmerr: or are you mainly talking about tbc
[9:50:49] Dreameaterz: just wait untill cloak gets in next phase :')
[9:50:53] hiraethonhs: hunter got nothing from runes pretty much
[9:51:06] kajjan112: uninterruptable, undispellable
[9:51:21] SireTV: what addon shows your mana cost per ability
[9:51:27] the_moist_factory: yeah i feel you
[9:51:48] the_moist_factory: no consequences to casting lifebloom
[9:52:42] the_moist_factory: LOL
[9:52:57] drishx: Gayge I like this
[9:53:01] kajjan112: Spell steal is the one counter i guess :D
[9:53:07] jarpzy: what do you think the best 5 man gank setup would be?
[9:53:19] kajjan112: but the gcd is 0.5 on lifebloom no?
[9:53:36] mopchild: 5 man ganks would be 5x boomkin surely
[9:53:45] mopchild: stealth and then just all starsurge
[9:54:07] drishx: is Shadowfiend good or nah
[9:54:25] kajjan112: its not a rune apparently, so very good
[9:54:31] underfearx: best counter play to lifebloom would be to keep switching targets so they go oom. but that’s in an ideal world cause good luck catching up to a Druid
[9:54:38] drishx: wait it's not a rune
[9:54:39] drishx: lmao
[9:54:41] SireTV: what addon shows your mana cost per ability
[9:55:01] drishx: where do you learn it
[9:55:27] piouspectre: Oh and what's the cd of fiend?. I've been afk
[9:55:30] mopchild: its like putting bop on someone
[9:55:31] mopchild: with heals
[9:55:36] mopchild: no counterplay
[9:56:06] drishx: questing looks awful lol
[9:56:14] mopchild: how comes you decided to level on US first?
[9:56:48] mopchild: fair fair
[9:57:08] Dreameaterz: time to get snutz back
[9:57:16] Dreameaterz: when SP is the stronger one ;)

[9:58:11] googlewooglex: I believe lifebloom is pretty expensive in sod with current mana pools? At least something
[9:58:13] perseay797: Leveling is for GIGACHAD s
[9:58:14] mopchild: how many coins you got so far?
[9:58:26] perseay797: Questing i mean

[9:59:14] djbawz_: 1.5k gold coins?
[9:59:15] Kyfoon: i dont think
[9:59:17] Frig0z: Either way it looked really fun, much better than giant raids AOEing each other
[9:59:31] Kyfoon: melee only have weapons i think
[9:59:33] Kyfoon: and hunter
[9:59:38] zyl88: there is nothing for caster, only rings while warr and ret get big weapons :D
