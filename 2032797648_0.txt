[3:51:45] Venomous: 7 days
[3:51:49] WidgyAinz: The best option for that game is just sharing people your mod folder and telling them how to place it and they don't know ahead of time what to expect
[3:52:01] WidgyAinz: There's one that LETS YOU LOCK DOORS WITH THE KEYS
[3:52:02] WidgyAinz: KEKW

[3:55:19] WidgyAinz: Yeah true
[3:55:22] Terrozer: ooo but imo i think you should use dual weild spec and water sheild to tank in raids if wanna threat
[3:55:32] WidgyAinz: Depends on your needs
[3:55:37] Terrozer: and just not swap for trash cus its so easy
