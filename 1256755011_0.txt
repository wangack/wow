[1:05:24] Stormhell1: pretty long agony
[1:05:31] Macosqt: @reaperspurpose wow been dying since wotlk ended

[1:06:05] Dab00tz: its not like you intend to pay with the full population everytime you play
[1:06:11] Macosqt: @reaperspurpose if your ocmparing the 2 i would pick vanilla

[1:06:18] FlreFrostY: That is 100% i heard that since WoTLK
[1:06:31] Cosmic_KO: Only game that might contend with it now is Ashes of Creation if it actually delivers what it promises. Which I'm still skeptical.
[1:06:31] Blacknyelloww: it will never die, COPIUM
[1:06:38] Grple_: what is it tell us
[1:06:39] Janno_: it might look more death now because the whole player base is splitted between so many versions of the game. But it does not really matter as long as your server has enough population
[1:06:48] doubled09: @c4rdstand feels like never lmao
[1:06:49] Knups: it would be cool if the next xpac was like.....good

[4:31:43] BigDroobEnergy: Yeah you can get it to 78 and then do your dailies
[4:31:47] infortheshow: Sounds like "content" without them having to add an actual additional content lol
[4:31:56] Jay_Vee_NL: it was only fun for the 2 weeks into shadowlands tbh after that ResidentSleeper
[4:32:00] deferes: I m levelling a blood dk know ,ı wanna know how can ı get 80 when ı came 50-60? @jldawg6
[4:32:05] BigDroobEnergy: Yeah only did torghast for one toon its boring all my others have 190
[4:32:08] BakaBiz: That’s the problem with retail. It’s a bunch of messed up systems that make you endlessly grind and grind and grind and most of it is just RNG hoping you get what you want
[4:32:16] Gaagaj: the conduit farm isn't so bad, but the arenas dmg are sick
[4:32:22] iamkjeld: What is it Blizzard don't like about having a weekly schedule you can finish for a character? Kinda like u had to do in Wrath. God that was so good
[4:32:27] Lyriskt: Why shaman and not warrior as usual?
[4:32:29] hardincomer: Do a choregast subathon @Swifty
[4:32:36] BigQonU: plus you actually enjoy pvp

[4:35:29] iamkjeld: @Deffar Exactly. Had they kept it like Mage Tower and made the rewards cosmetic or even high end gear, that'd have been great. In my opinion at least
[4:35:29] koyoshii: PepePls
[4:35:42] Showerfarte: talking about torghast is putting me to sleep
[4:35:56] iamkjeld: @Deffar or green fire quest for warlock. That was HARD lol
