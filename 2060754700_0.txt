[0:58:46] Feroxita1337: i think in the last years you guys had the luxury of being able to rely your mains... maybe its time to practice alts more again
[0:58:52] atomic_gossipgirlxo: I used to vape before bed. Stopped because I noticed I kept waking up in the morning feeling phlegmy. Actually helped.
[0:58:54] EmpStyle: I've had covid 3 times, never lost sense of smell or taste
[0:59:02] Neji513: is maro and looney permanently banned?
[0:59:22] Alegral: so now you blame raiku Kappa
[0:59:28] zaigodmodex: Dh is just stupid tbh

[1:00:08] Mxlasthope: !00ney got banned?
[1:00:08] Alegral: give raiku ret and you play dh no ? Kappa
[1:00:12] berbatovvv: the new caster said your teams were basically mirrors because dh is the same as outlaw. thoughts on that?
[1:00:33] M1ndOwner: but lontar told raiku that he shouldn't play reverse
[1:00:38] manyforless: why he didnt know tech

[1:19:50] 00ZZEE: its a good strategy to use things people havent practiced against tho, that happens in games like league as well
[1:20:09] SuperSunBros64: how do you think Liquid stacks up against the top EU teams???

[1:29:55] tic1993: hey whaazz did that guy ever donate u that 400 euro for making a shadowpriest ?

[1:30:03] torkija: you took the 1k$ challenge?
[1:30:09] ayosteviey: @xlnt1337 Yeah it was all effects of aug release
[1:30:12] corntham: going into mid season clash, are you confident of taking it down?

[1:34:57] Deathmarkedx: because lontar is the new guy on the team so they just made him a scapegoat
[1:35:10] deucaly: toxic ad in shffle
[1:35:20] FoxiekittenWoW: i think alot of people think he is kinda toxic on his stream
[1:35:28] bobthegoblin_: SP players are happy about using 6 globals to set up a 200k dmg cast when every other class does it with an instant
[1:35:40] Deathmarkedx: bro lontar is an insanely fun streamer idk how people think hes toxic
[1:35:51] Deathmarkedx: we all say some shit when u play competitive games
[1:35:57] Deathmarkedx: we*
[1:36:00] knoffx: @bobthegoblin_ well if you get all the stars aligned you can do 600k in one global
[1:36:01] jawst3k: yea
[1:36:05] LilDeanix: Void Torrent gives you 3 stacks if full channel
[1:36:05] fatulina: mindspike mindflay and voidtorrent

[1:36:25] healhut: thats why people cast it first global of match usualy
[1:36:28] DipdabTwitch: Thats why Wizk said you void torrent first gloval for stacks
[1:36:31] ngage44: full channel void torrent grants 3 stacks
[1:36:33] phantomhunterxz: ppl was hating on Lontar cuz comentators said that Fuseton's shaman was superior
[1:36:33] knoffx: @bobthegoblin_ carthasis + 4piece + mindspike crit
[1:36:47] bobthegoblin_: @knoffx oh I thought u meant a mindspike for 600k

[1:37:44] obviouslytai: disagree. a lot of good shadow priest logs have a ton of healing
[1:37:45] emmywiink: a flash heal also gives you 10% damage reduction for 10 sec
[1:38:01] obviouslytai: ^
[1:38:15] aoespawn: I hate Polly clears my dots hunters do that shit tooo
[1:38:22] bobthegoblin_: @obviouslytai u still ideally do dmg instead of healing but u heal when ur out of good globals

[2:45:18] wardelswijk: what makes u think fuseton would be better at shaman then lontar
[2:45:26] goldenpharmy: lontar on of the best
[2:45:28] slickdaddyg69: Lontar is the best he just plays too much solo shuffle
[2:45:38] assrug: but you lose first time with lontar = lontar fault
[2:45:39] livetleves: is lontar better than cdew atm?
[2:45:41] pazta9: lontar is by far the best sham has been for literally so many years
[2:45:45] goldenpharmy: maybe the best
[2:45:46] nood4e: yeah but that was because of immortal lock and DH tripling dmg
[2:45:47] sponkss: Tbh it's impressive that Fuseton got this good on healers in such short time
[2:45:48] Esotraz: @livetleves yes
[2:45:49] pazta9: not sure why people suddenly think otherwise
[2:45:55] Aimed57: poor lontar getting hate from people that have no clue what they're even talking about. People just read "lontar sucks" in awc chat and get stuck on repeat.

[2:48:18] josi888: I must say man, I realy enjoyed your Rogue play on tournament. dont be sad, your team do very good work, and series was insane
[2:48:20] knoffx: ven had the best take for it under lontars tweet.. imagine you are top 0.01 in this game and every single person that flames you is a 100% a worse player than u just dont let that shit get to u
[2:48:20] mayzimtv: its been the same forever and its not just wow its every gaming community
[2:48:24] Pradence: To be fair... I kinda think its good that more teams actually can compete against you :P Makes it more fun
[2:48:25] veekslol: twitch cahts on any competative stream is just aids anyway not even worth watching
[2:48:31] nood4e: all of the awc chat wanted you guys to lose just because they are shit and want the Titan Echo to fall, that's pretty much it. I had to switch the chat cause else i was getting banned for sure
[2:48:32] unluckythen: lontar is toxic out of shuffle too
[2:48:32] aframpp: but lontar never makes it personal its just a game
[2:48:33] Sokkee: its Shuffle thats made too be toxic

[2:49:15] knoffx: the cc changes reduced the importance of skill in games by a huge amount
[2:49:26] einfachsobruda: Ye we need Cata !!!
[2:49:35] einfachsobruda: Or MOP
[2:49:40] kilralium: he is good but ur the shotcaller
[2:49:44] knoffx: 100%
[2:49:45] nood4e: @Whaazz Did you explain why you went back RMD after winning with RLD?
[2:49:47] goldenpharmy: easy to pick victims after a lose @Whaazz
[2:49:47] knoffx: ppl would be completely lost
[2:49:49] knoffx: ye
[2:49:51] eacherro: feels so hard to punish bad play
[2:49:56] einfachsobruda: I think the best way to fix wow is to restart the game

[2:51:14] nood4e: its a clown m+ fiesta in arenas right now, sadly

[2:51:39] wave0007: @slickdaddyg69 not a flex bro
[2:51:39] knoffx: @Frkntv kinda yeah but its always been the same ppl i guess playing a good RM makes you the best comp in game with recent metas but being avg on it doesnt give you anything
[2:51:53] hamerstream88: @slickdaddyg69 thats the reason they need to nerf dh
[2:51:56] knoffx: i guess ppl hate to ehar it but i just think rm is the most skill dependant comp and that makes it nice to watch and nice to play
[2:52:08] slickdaddyg69: @hamerstream88 dont nerf pls i wanna stay 2400 :(

[2:52:32] Frkntv: @knoffx spam ccing the whole team is not really skilled either lol
[2:52:32] and1spirit: lontar is a chill and innocent human being ofc but he has a big ego and is very cocky on stream, which is why he gets more hate than a guy like chan
[2:52:35] eacherro: @knoffx Well if so many 1500 hit 2,4 with DH, sure they dont like to hear, that state of game is in favour of nobrainism
[2:52:42] aframpp: can i make a macro so i cast a spell and jump at the same time

[4:23:40] xDaruis: I've haven't followed the awc scene in a while, how come you don't play with mehhx anymore?
[4:23:45] ngage44: increase CC duration reduce dmg so ppl actually dont press burst on first global
[4:24:04] pedrayy: its kinda hard to make arena fast paced and skilled at the same time, its either damp af or low skill cleave meta
[4:24:06] bestchaakbestjjang: does anyone know if it is us east server for cross region tourney? or us west
[4:24:14] blinkers89: i mean like if i get a 8-10 sec poly, or however long it was, on the healer isnt it a pretty much guaranteed kill atm
