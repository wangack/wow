[1:33:01] TheBritishBastard: @TheBritishBastard I started in WoD, so all's I've ever really known is borrowed power, and that taught me to only play Wow in the last content patch of an expansion. With all this and no borrowed power I'll be able to consistently play and not feel my time investment was wasted. I'm also sick of being a main character, so, I hope I can not be that this expansion.
[1:33:04] HebbyB: no idea lol

[1:34:14] HebbyB: yeah I wonder if they need to tune some of these quests for high pop areas, or will it just instantly be done by the time you fly there
[1:34:26] Armdel: half the talens give you back abilites you already have

[1:56:23] GamingDad77: sexy map addon...lol
[1:56:34] Layliah79: maybe in future patches they will add more UI. this is the starter IMO

[2:00:14] Layliah79: they should icons on the map where  each rep hub is
[2:00:43] elizondria: it might be renown unlocks the ability to start it or get better rewards?

[2:12:30] Robodope: nah i think its intentional
[2:12:51] RocketMan23: 6 or 8 seems much more reasonable
[2:12:51] Robodope: 4% leech for the entire raid within 40yd would be massive

[3:21:26] Neziko: lacOld After 80 years
[3:21:28] dewking93: what comes first aoc or elder scrolls 6 or gta 6
[3:21:32] Mecabeast: can't wait to hear more about the riot mmo they've been pretty hush hush on it
[3:21:36] Sathfire: i didnt get alpha yet, i thought i was special
[3:21:41] Molvonos: Everquest was almost entirely open world.  Dungeons and Raids included.  It was also more 'hardcore', where you could lose your gear if you died in a bad place and you always lost XP when you died unless you were resurrected.
[3:21:43] RobNXS: Yeah, I just remember seeing the everquest box whenever I would go to Fry's electronics. Always wanted to play it but our family computer was a literal potato lol
[3:21:45] GamingDad77: my alzhiemers and dementia prolly wonlt allow me to play AoC
[3:21:48] AvrithSATX: I'
[3:21:49] Sathfire: haha <3
[3:21:54] Sollice: @dewking93 This isnt even close. ES6 and GTA6 will be out next year othe year after
[3:21:55] xReadyAimMissx: D:
[3:21:59] 91Niki: @91Niki Yeah the annoying part of Battlefield is that it takes them 1-2 years to make the game good and fixed a lot of issues. That's another thing about EA and other big companies like that. They don't give a shit, cuz they made their money off people. It comes down to the deadlines devs are given. Lack of flexability and freedom to polish a game before releasing it
[3:22:01] AvrithSATX: I'm curious about the new unannounced MMO that Zenimax is working on.
[3:22:01] Mitune: Not even in hers Sadge
[3:22:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: peepoSad
[3:22:04] Molvonos: Almost everything in EQ was group content - soloing, unless you were a bard, was impossible.
[3:22:05] Broomba: @towellie -- its like the 6th sense -- you are dying on your bed and you say I see AOC a dead game
[3:22:18] Shattermare: Is the Dragonflight story/questing good so far?
[3:22:28] Sollice: Rubicite Armor gang!.....Does anyone know what that is
[3:22:29] BigHeroSixy: @Molvonos Necro, mage, enchanter, bstlord. They could all solo pretty well
[3:22:31] FuriousPorpoise: I am at the point that I think the longer a game is in development, the further it is from release
[3:22:33] Aidler: you are all special…. Blizz just doesn’t know it
[3:22:34] nrgman: what game we talking about
[3:22:34] maccaruso: AOC Launch: Cue Illidan - "It's been 10,000 years"
[3:22:41] PrimalRain: Same here. Did a ton of UO before wow though

[3:23:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: a $500 alpha LUL
[3:23:16] Shattermare: Lol true
[3:23:28] Sollice: Break in to houses with flour bags hooray
[3:23:47] Mitune: Super apprehensive about Ashes. I feel its too ambitious and too focused on old school mmo ways
[3:24:03] Aidler: I always get the feeling that Asmon is somehow invested in AOC
[3:24:20] Jarlan23: i hope its good but i have a feeling it wont be
[3:24:24] Sollice: @Aidler I doubt it, he is making his own MMO that will be a competitor
[3:24:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah but that $400 for you is a lifetime sub, that $500 alpha didnt include that LUL

[5:23:20] HeatherJC83: @Towelliee done these talent trees so much, he'd be able to do them with his eyes closed. lol
[5:23:23] Rudric_Ice: 20 lvls doesn't even open up 10% of the game the free trial is dogshit
[5:23:43] reaprwolf: Shadowlands base edition free until the 5th

[5:24:03] HeatherJC83: @Rudric_Ice yea and you hit 20 so fast. I have so many lvl 20 characters lol
[5:24:22] Funderik: @Rudric_Ice 20 levels to a new player is a few hours, most people will know after a few hours of something if they will enjoy it.
[5:24:32] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice That was my thinking
[5:24:50] Sollice: You typically know pretty quick if you jive with a game and may play it more

[5:27:13] Funderik: @dreamwalker213 but that doesn't matter to a new player, they are new and unaware of the endgame.
[5:27:20] Sollice: @duman_2020 When it comes out
[5:27:24] anduinwindrunner: is this a thing in retail?
[5:27:27] Zigg3man: say w00t?! to many epic and you get slowed and silence.. hope not for final release
[5:27:30] Unrealsiege: but why?
[5:27:44] HeatherJC83: @Zigg3man just crafted gear lol

[5:30:16] Sollice: @anduinwindrunner Sure
[5:30:32] Shrenko: @anduinwindrunner it speaks for itself though, only Blizzard knows when beta releases its up to them
[5:30:38] Skales1: @abracka_ pretty close
[5:30:40] caspre01: dont prot have the talent to spread Rend with Thunder Clap?
[5:30:43] dreamwalker213: @funderik that’s my point, what if a new player hates the leveling but would’ve enjoyed m+/raid/etc. They’ll never get to find out if they enjoy the main content of the game with a trial
[5:31:01] LiveFromStua: damn. I think I might have to buy this expack. The talent tree's look good
[5:31:14] mrsuflakis: Didn't Blizzard say they wont put  in the class tree?
[5:31:42] Zigg3man: talent trees looks alright, back to old days, but maybe you can't create them cookiecutter builds no more
[5:31:53] Chaostheory16: does the talent tree have a search bar?
[5:31:56] paragon_3: it seems dumb that you can get all 3 bottom abilities on the right side
[5:32:07] anduinwindrunner: @Chaostheory16 no

[5:49:27] Namtarts_TV: renown is a literal superior rep system imo
[5:49:28] DeanoTV: people will never be happy and complain about anything LUL
[5:49:30] Sollice: EVERYTHING SUCKS....Whats one thing we could do to make it better. I DONT KNOW I AM NOT A DEV
[5:49:40] Zigg3man: sorry sir, don't have US account nor alpha, tho would be cool if I did towSip
[5:50:13] smashwow: i think it's just too close to SL mechanics and people just want to be done with SL

[5:50:34] GiveLoveLive: Yeah makes rep feel better
[5:50:39] xmedpakx: i think it looks fun
[5:50:40] paragon_3: They just replaced with with more mobs that need individual rep which is annoying
[5:50:41] reinhardtdog: And the AH down again lol
[5:50:41] DeanoTV: @smashwow its literally replacing reps
[5:50:43] KyleEverett: Free Shadowlands, that's more evidence since they normally roll that in to base game close to launch. :D
[5:50:47] vic_ave: How dare they!
[5:50:49] Funderik: @Mecabeast no one predicted this and we're still in august. it's a none issue.
[5:51:00] notdustinx: We like that shit hell yeah

[5:51:23] Layliah79: it's all optional to those that don't care about that stuff.
[5:51:29] smashwow: @DeanoTV i'm aware. doesn't change the fact people will draw similarities between this new system and SL renown
[5:51:33] Funderik: people always expect more/something different, but never know what is actually is they are expecting.
[5:51:37] thagalvir: do you think they will roll out 1 or 2 new renowns on the 10.1 or 10.2 when they drop a new zone like nazjatar?
[5:51:37] Layliah79: I can't wait for it! so much more rewarding and meaningful rep

[5:51:51] DeanoTV: its SO much better than rep
[5:51:56] smashwow: renown is attached to covenants and that triggers the ptsd
[5:52:08] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:52:09] Coffenatic: Agree, people just be flaming change
[5:52:11] DeanoTV: theres no covenants tho
[5:52:33] instant_savage: yeah but in guildwars everything is acciunt wide, gold rep everything account wide
[5:52:35] xmedpakx: I hope the overall community can eventually sit back and just love what they bring us , kinda doubt they will but here's to hoping!
[5:52:44] Funderik: covenants were not even bad, not being able to swap freely was bad.
[5:52:47] Jacuzo: is dragonriding account wide too?
[5:52:53] wowking35: yes
[5:52:55] GiveLoveLive: Yeah account wide currency would be sick too

[5:53:06] brian_777777777: guild wars sounds like a pseudo rpg action adventure
[5:53:16] smashwow: oh they'll probably let that happen because somehow they'll attach power to it @Towelliee
[5:53:18] caffeas988: i believe reps wont be accaunt wide since thats outdoor content
[5:53:27] Sevrynx: do you think they would ever do the ff approach and let characters chain classes. to avoid doing account wide faction stuff?
[5:53:34] MercurialPTDR: and what is wrong with that?
[5:53:35] Sevrynx: change

[5:56:56] KyleEverett: @Sevrynx I like being able to play a variety of races and looks so I'd rather WoW just go the route of everything account wide
