[0:09:16] wackpoetic: except paypal i think
[0:09:23] AngryMatt: Yea I'm so tired of the mentality that anyone that disagrees with you is somehow less intelligent. Two smart people are able to disagree.
[0:09:53] Jubite: yo re: your tier list, what do you think made UDK drop from S at the start of patch to B
[0:09:55] b1vcksheep: I believe there is M+
[0:09:55] heymomimonttv: @wackpoetic he bought his way into paypal too i believe

[0:10:46] Bigmoran: Bigmoran subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Riptide is a broken ability press 1 if you agree
[0:10:52] heymomimonttv: DK is still good, just nowhere near as good as it was at the start of the season
[0:11:11] e10100111001: I'll queue after some balances. Other games until then
[0:11:14] storm_chaser_ron: https://x.com/stergey/status/1758266183101407711?s=20
[0:11:18] gdodmebxu: i think a lot of that has to do with the meta but yeah i agree
[0:11:40] xhinoc: man frost DK here ü§öüèºand I stopped playing since September 2023
[0:11:46] hamsti: :)
[0:12:02] marvin1995xo: a dh

[0:12:27] Bigmoran: Those shuffles are the worst
[0:12:28] fistweaveurnan: Yep trinket stam buff needs to be reverted immediately
[0:12:40] hyggemeisterTay: Belated comment; Elon is a sperg but a world class visual systems thinker; you can tell he sees what he speaks of especially when discussing engineering topics, so he is sometimes ridiculous but def not stupid!
[0:12:49] Falkhord: bro is this my playlist from 2010?
[0:12:53] Xeliumimar: Please nerf stam i beg lol
[0:12:54] heymomimonttv: H DAT
[0:13:00] hyggemeisterTay: Btw at lower ranks, anyone have thoughts of what DPS classes are less likely to be kill targets in solo shuffle?
[0:13:04] stuffiexo: my ss rounds last 7 minutes
[0:13:09] gdodmebxu: @hyggemeisterTay feral druid Kappa
[0:13:09] marvin1995xo: no the stamina is good just some classes are too tanky
[0:13:14] DjemDruid: venruki thoughts on just removing all MS effects from the game and increasing dampening? i feel like they gave it to so many classes it's pointless to have now
[0:13:18] heymomimonttv: @hyggemeisterTay DH, and only DH
[0:13:24] xhinoc: the solution for PvP is copy paste MoP PvP
[0:13:29] fistweaveurnan: @marvin1995xo 3s matches go for 8-10 minutes regardless of comps. Its not good sorry
[0:13:33] dailyshuffle: i had yesterday two times 3 demon hunters in my lobby, really fun lobbies Kappa , they went always for the healer...so boring
[0:13:46] DjemDruid: feels like it makes some comps unviable having it in the game
[0:14:03] heymomimonttv: ^
[0:14:19] cyborg1141: Ele demo locks feelsgood
[0:14:26] wackpoetic: just played against double dh on ruins of lordaeron... every match was just train the healer
[0:14:28] heymomimonttv: no casters having MS means any caster comp is forced to play into damp
[0:14:40] gritngrind81: its like that every meta
[0:15:15] DjemDruid: @heymomimonttv ret and enha are the only melees without it i think, arbitrarily locks them out of some comps
[0:15:27] DjemDruid: they should make MS a warrior only thing again
[0:15:45] stuffiexo: that monk is about to have a bad time lol
[0:16:25] storm_chaser_ron: easy game

[0:20:05] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: good balance between damage and healing
[0:20:12] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: it‚Äôs way more fun
[0:20:47] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: you would def like it once you got used to it. one of the best overall made healers in the game in my opinion even if it isn‚Äôt OP

[0:26:35] Killshotz_24: WW carry?
[0:26:43] fenris_06: average healer experience in ss
[0:26:47] heymomimonttv: damn rdruid got a sus name

[0:31:41] Dues: Your gears breaking
[0:32:13] baxter5569: i feel like if they just halfed the rating loss you get as a healer it would incentivize more healers. so many 3-3 lobbies and one bad lobby and u lose 72 points. 2-4 is a 20-30pt loss

[0:33:31] emergencxyz: better player
[0:33:37] fenris_06: Should be ok...
[0:33:39] elkimjongun: a crusader reference?
[0:33:50] fenris_06: Spamming some good ol fash heals...
[0:35:08] Nerfmetodeath: put ur wep enchant on
[0:35:52] Pur9lehat: try undercurrent with primal tidal core, earthliving big succ
[0:37:59] CabinetMistake: NotLikeThis
[0:38:02] emergencxyz: Dh is just the best player in the lobby
[0:38:03] bubblebuddyx_: I think u are losing a lot of hps holding onto healing stream totem for 15+ seconds
[0:40:04] Nerfmetodeath: ik earthliving is only a few percent, but it's 0% if you dont put it on
[0:40:40] zachgamegodx: nice purge protection against a hunter and a dh !
[0:41:48] zachgamegodx: u can beat xtreme orc tbf
[0:42:00] Endoraesh: i really hate when that happens
[0:42:01] cruelhabbitts: love going up against rank 1 alts
[0:42:04] famous1939: i believe in the pooper of procs
[0:42:17] hogx: all mmr seems super delated....3s and shuffle
[0:42:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: born2shuffle
[0:42:22] crawnpocktail: just poop out some procs ezclap
[0:42:38] Roxxybolts: breakfast with the poop
[0:42:53] hogx: i'm grinding gear on my 5th hunter around 1900...lots of glad mounts around
[0:43:12] sourbutts: hey champ how you doin
[0:43:20] heymomimonttv: @hogx yea, my friends i do 3s with are usually 2k+ but currently we're around 1650-1700 and have to play out of our minds
[0:43:54] Saitistreamy: @heymomimonttv the only inflation we have seen is R1 players are in glad range, and Mglad players are between 2.1 and 2.4 right now
[0:44:46] Sosatko: Just been doin SOD and quein at night
[0:44:55] absterge: hate to be the bearer of bad news but you don‚Äôt have earthliving on
[0:44:58] Dues: I get glad most seasons I try. Stuck around 2200-2300 this season
[0:45:12] saviortheret: can you say that again i only heard a part of it but it sounds like youre confirming something i was thinking
[0:45:17] Saitistreamy: @Dues brother out in the wild
[0:45:27] absterge: 3-5% and purge protection ydgaf dude
[0:45:43] bollskis: he doesnt give an f about nothin
[0:45:43] hays4dayz: unleash life though interacts with earth living I think
[0:45:45] saviortheret: i feel like ive been seening nothing but R1s and Mglads in 2100-2400 range over and over in SS and 3s. its making getting glad impossible
[0:45:51] Zenfuzz: the glads doing 2s carries are tearing up the 1700-2000 brackets
[0:45:59] bjjamm: wait is that the reason why I'm struggling so hard to get above 1600 rating? or am I just bad
[0:46:00] hamsti: earth living is a crutch
[0:46:07] JustTaki: rukiBuddy  how are you doing today?
[0:46:27] gdodmebxu: having a glad mount doesn't mean you're glad xp on the alt you're playing
[0:46:35] gdodmebxu: they're acc wide now
[0:46:46] absterge: @saviortheret well‚Ä¶ for shuffle 2400-2500 is pushing top of the ladder for most healers. it‚Äôs lame :(
[0:46:50] absterge: in shuffle
[0:47:03] Saitistreamy: @gdodmebxu yeah but wow isnt a twitch game as much as knowledge. After a certain point alts are default going to be way higher even when new to it
[0:47:11] saviortheret: @gdodmebxu no youre right. but if they are on an alt that is the same class whats your opinion then?
[0:47:25] gdodmebxu: @saviortheret yeah that's smurfing
[0:47:40] gdodmebxu: which is lame but they normally climb fast
[0:47:44] gdodmebxu: this season just super deflated
[0:47:51] absterge: HAHAHAP
[0:48:00] JustTaki: right on :)
[0:48:09] Dues: We are still missing like 300-400 points of inflation
[0:48:15] gdodmebxu: what a name
[0:48:18] deepTTV: jesus sterge. subbed for 8 years
[0:48:32] abelito900: Won't you cast now?
[0:48:32] Sosatko: I think its just less and less ppl playing tbh
[0:48:39] Saitistreamy: @Dues link vers?
[0:48:42] gdodmebxu: the worst part is they deflated it and kept mmr from before so you had to wait super long even at season start Kappa
[0:48:42] Roxxybolts: I tell you what you can't do queue
[0:49:11] Saitistreamy: PVP players are basically required to make 4 alts to inject a player base into the system to produce inflation
[0:49:16] saviortheret: @absterge the other day i was able to 6-0 dannycarry but he was on monk. and it was in that range too like 2300-2400. man those are some hard games. im not a tourney player or R1 i just want competitive games but not sooo sweaty. like a single mistake in SS i get whisp so much for "throwing" and threats with report
[0:49:19] baxter5569: im not even playing anything but a healer right now. i want fast queues and playing for 4-5 hours with 30-40min queues on dps to gain no rating at 2100 when im playing R1 players is rough.
[0:49:19] heymomimonttv: @Zenfuzz yea ran into pikaboo the other night. granted he stays in that bracket cuz of the comps he plays but still
[0:49:48] gdodmebxu: @saviortheret have to ignore those people
[0:49:48] bollskis: pika gate kept my 1800 for days on end
[0:49:52] gdodmebxu: they're usually the problem too KEKW
[0:49:53] bollskis: literally had to dodge him
[0:50:28] gdodmebxu: the toxic players are almost always the most clueless
[0:51:01] gdodmebxu: avg healer experience
[0:51:05] gdodmebxu: FeelsBadMan
[0:51:06] heymomimonttv: it's also crazy that looking at drustvar if you're 1800 on dps, you're better than 80% of players currently
[0:51:08] saviortheret: @gdodmebxu what really upset me is when people are mad about not getting BoP. not understanding they already recieved a BoP and are on forb
[0:51:15] Saitistreamy: its insane also no changes for MMR or Balance
[0:51:20] gdodmebxu: @saviortheret yeah literally just have to ignore it
[0:51:22] Saitistreamy: not a word lol
[0:51:37] Zeniticon: i got gatekeept by swapxy on EU
[0:51:43] reavethederp: @gdodmebxu ^
[0:51:49] baxter5569: @heymomimonttv 2100 is top 5% of shuffle dps
[0:51:54] Saitistreamy: can someone spoof that its ending the season in 2 weeks so people can start playing?
[0:51:56] hogx: i think they fired so many people at Blizzard, we're lucky the servers are even running
[0:52:05] heymomimonttv: @baxter5569 and that's also nuts to think about
[0:52:14] Sundagar: 20-30min queues as dps in 1,600 rating range in SS then getting flamed once you actually are in a game is kinda demoralizing. had a healer tell me im the reason SS sucks last night lol
[0:52:23] bollskis: i had to turn off the wowhead discord bot b/c its just all sod updates BibleThump
[0:52:26] absterge: yeah let me do it rn
[0:52:33] legiontheworgen: @absterge bless u
[0:52:33] drdoomkinx: inflation isnt going to bring more people back into pvp at this point
[0:52:34] gdodmebxu: we need a sterge tweet more than ev
[0:52:38] heymomimonttv: @Sundagar thats crazy cuz the healer is also 1600 so not any better or worse than you lol
[0:52:39] enviscerate: tweet about dh too
[0:52:41] gdodmebxu: @drdoomkinx yes it would
[0:52:44] Saitistreamy: steamers have a HUGE incentive to encourage inflation
[0:52:49] Saitistreamy: its crazy they dont all agree on it lol
[0:52:54] soddi: a season 2 2700cr 3s glad heal opponent crushed my morale yesterday as well :<
[0:52:55] b_lappy: we need new pvp devs, only thing that will fix things imho
[0:53:03] Sundagar: @heymomimonttv yeah go figure
[0:53:06] hogx: we need inflation and more rewards to encourage pve players to pvp
[0:53:07] saviortheret: DH and outlaw feel a little too strong
[0:53:20] ralotheret: bring back the Ret Meta
[0:53:20] Saitistreamy: lots of inflation, means 0 to hero, random carries to goals, more people playing
[0:53:22] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[0:53:24] gdodmebxu: outlaw dh
[0:53:25] gdodmebxu: SMOrc
[0:53:26] nameyourform: must have saw cdews stream lol
[0:53:28] Saitistreamy: players = viewers
[0:53:28] Sosatko: the epitome of
[0:53:30] Sosatko: do damage dont die
[0:53:46] sourbutts: ahh yes the unkiteable combo
[0:54:02] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[0:54:04] wicked_wizurd: sounds like a very engaging and fun comp!
[0:54:18] Saitistreamy: its time to just roll DH in mass
[0:54:20] reavethederp: i thinkk they testing tho
[0:54:21] zachgamegodx: i told u this would become the best comp
[0:54:23] tolginyoo: outlaw+DH just show how mind blowingly imbalanced the pvp is
[0:54:23] n0bodygood: IS THAT MESIDAN?!?
[0:54:24] Reuhn: I feel like playing shaman because of this mog
[0:54:31] hogx: lets just play triple blood sk vs tripple blood dk
[0:54:35] CabinetMistake: should we come up with a name for the comp
[0:54:36] Tragictomb: yeah I mean I‚Äôm around 2k mmr on MW just from last season‚Äôs rating‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt want to queue into Procpooper much less that shaman lol
[0:54:40] heymomimonttv: i was play retwar last night and we queued into double dh and i dont think we've ever lost a round quicker than that
[0:54:59] reavethederp: demon thug 4Head
[0:55:01] Saitistreamy: does double DH just kill healers?
[0:55:04] zachgamegodx: @heymomimonttv should not lose to that bro
[0:55:14] heymomimonttv: @zachgamegodx how
[0:55:14] zachgamegodx: just kill their healer
[0:55:19] Dues: Double DH kills everything
[0:55:28] heymomimonttv: we went their healer and they were able to kill our healer faster @zachgamegodx
[0:55:37] zachgamegodx: did u vene the healer
[0:55:38] zachgamegodx: sanc or bop
[0:55:52] davErosEe: don‚Äôt really see a reason to play double dh over other cleaves
[0:55:53] heymomimonttv: of course we did
[0:56:06] nameyourform: did u see palumor video on that rogue macro lol
[0:56:15] Saitistreamy: DF is the Xpac of melee being broken AF , S1 Ret S3 DH
[0:56:24] beeftip: 1500 on my war, just want the 1800 set.  Get to 1590, then go 0-6 like it's my job, today has been 15min queues for 3x 3-3 games back to back. It's frustrating for us bads
[0:56:33] absterge: they aren‚Äôt gonna help with mmr because realistically the system is gonna have to be changed completely. everyone just waits til last 2-4 weeks to push rating. currently 1300 toons at or above 2400 in 3s.
[0:57:08] Saitistreamy: there is zero reason if you are not close to glad to play after 1800
[0:57:10] Saitistreamy: the enchant is ass
[0:57:16] absterge: yeah I mean I‚Äôm like rank 4 on my shaman, I‚Äôve actually gone UP a few ranks in the last 3 weeks üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[0:57:21] migliqt: make a smurf q like in league
[0:57:22] gdodmebxu: i don't think the enchant is that bad
[0:57:34] Saitistreamy: its just outdated is the issue with enchants
[0:57:37] Saitistreamy: its a bad reward
[0:57:47] migliqt: you are like ip tagged so when you make a fresh account you dont get the same q's
[0:57:52] sourbutts: they just check for smurfs
[0:57:55] tolginyoo: @beeftip this happened to me with 2100 on my WW, i was 2095 then back to 1900, bounce between. just need to keep queuing, eventually happens
[0:57:55] Saitistreamy: sure
[0:57:57] Saitistreamy: its a good enchant
[0:58:03] Saitistreamy: that you'll never bother to look at again lol
[0:58:06] TheKidRobin: mog is 10/10
[0:58:09] Saitistreamy: mog is 10/10
[0:58:14] absterge: they need to put in .01% effort to put a fucking pet for getting 2k rating LMAO no troll
[0:58:15] TheKidRobin: lol
[0:58:17] Gajing: god I love babooshka in that mog
[0:58:22] Saitistreamy: Something that is better then the mog
[0:58:26] seyvyur: that's last seasons enchant
[0:58:29] cruelhabbitts: enchant is dope
[0:58:33] serratedlove: anyone else think it's weird people can get r1 shuffle without getting legend?
[0:58:47] Saitistreamy: I think a mount that is a non armour of the glad mount
[0:58:50] Saitistreamy: could work
[0:58:55] Reuhn: we are all mad coz we dont have the red pvp enchant, dont mind us
[0:59:02] zartorak: where u get that transmog?
[0:59:11] Bonegraft: how about 2 mounts or two enchants?
[0:59:15] Bonegraft: or maybe 3?
[0:59:16] Saitistreamy: People 100% hop on old glad moutns though yea?
[0:59:18] Bonegraft: get crazy
[0:59:18] hogx: i don't think it's weird to get r1 without getting legend....i've been top 10 on prot pally every season without getting legend
[0:59:23] cruelhabbitts: can I see the tmog
[0:59:28] 3mirrors: 30 days of free game time :)
[0:59:32] jonathan_mop: A $5 Subway card.
[0:59:42] absterge: @hogx you better stay on BM hunter man don‚Äôt go prot
[0:59:43] serratedlove: legend req for r1 makes people have to queue on alts though
[0:59:45] drfeltgood: morning @venruki
[1:00:02] hogx: nope.....missed it but like 3 spots....only top 4 got it
[1:00:03] Juliio29: people just want to be rewarded for being casual and get the same shit people have grinded to get better for like glad mounts enchants etc
[1:00:06] absterge: I feel like even adding a pet to 2k rating would be better than we have now
[1:00:10] Saitistreamy: When looking at someone else character, how often can you identify the enchant, or season, if ever
[1:00:39] absterge: the truth of the matter is they could show up to work and add random shit to rewards in a heartbeat‚Ä¶ they just don‚Äôt want to LOL
[1:00:40] ATHLTE: enchants are sick af
[1:00:43] arzak: 2400 enchant?
[1:00:44] Saitistreamy: I think 1800 should be enchant, and 2.1 should be mog
[1:00:47] drfeltgood: Best enchant in a while
[1:00:49] cruelhabbitts: really is
[1:00:49] fenris_06: @Saitistreamy pretty often actually
[1:00:53] fistweaveurnan: 100% just jealous people who couldnt get it lmao
[1:00:57] absterge: I think the enchants have been rly cool
[1:00:57] symptomV: bloody danceing steel best one for sure
[1:01:01] absterge: personally
[1:01:21] enviscerate: @symptomV i still have old weps with blood dancing steel enchant on them in my bank
[1:01:21] Saitistreamy: @fenris_06 I might be wrong here, but I play SP so the enchant is overcovered by shadowform typically
[1:01:35] fenris_06: @Saitistreamy fair enough
[1:01:44] Gajing: they could add a lot more stuff to the honor reward system too, it‚Äôs really under utilized and incentivizes pvp queuing in all brackets
[1:01:44] tolginyoo: @Juliio29 yeah, and they don't see anything wrong with this. LUL
[1:01:45] sourbutts: @Saitistreamy theres a glyph to make you not shadowy if you want
[1:02:04] Bonegraft: we should change the entire reward system because that guy plays shadow priest
[1:02:23] tolginyoo: @Saitistreamy enchant is more noticable imo, therefore i disagree
[1:02:23] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:02:30] Zeniticon: just use the toy  Heartsbane Grimoire , works in arena
[1:02:45] Zeniticon: then you're the shadowpriest
[1:02:52] Saitistreamy: @tolginyoo I think by and large there is a huge post 1800 drop off, and the enchant is desirable for some but not nearly as big of a thing
[1:02:59] symptomV: @enviscerate wild
[1:03:23] gdodmebxu: Pog
[1:03:25] Glazucho: This enchant is insane and u can't get anymore FeelsStrongMan
[1:03:26] soddi: fresh out of the SOD factory
[1:03:29] Xeliumimar: The Cheeser Xeek
[1:03:34] seyvyur: the problem for real priests is that benediction/anathema can't get enchants transmoged
[1:03:35] tolginyoo: babooshka is so hot, i can't even
[1:03:41] serratedlove: why cant hunters apply wep illusions to bows / guns? in mop you could put the disarm wep enchant and it made your bow/gun glow red like GT
[1:04:08] CabinetMistake: the suptaease crossover we needed but don't deserve
[1:04:20] heymomimonttv: babooshka brought the taco meat out to play
[1:04:28] heymomimonttv: he's ready to give sweaty hairy hugs
[1:04:39] sixthycent: tun dh and outlaw, and fix healer mmr thatbwould be a great end of season patch notes
[1:04:52] emergencxyz: @sixthycent I agree dh needs buffs
[1:04:58] tolginyoo: @Glazucho legit only subbed to get it back in s2, i had no interest to play back then :D
[1:05:13] Dues: Buff DH and destro
[1:05:15] primejusticegaming: yo what up ven
[1:05:50] storm_chaser_ron: double DK fw
[1:05:53] storm_chaser_ron: should be fun
[1:06:02] reavethederp: SMOrc
[1:06:04] heymomimonttv: wow friday MDI has way more viewers than friday AWC
[1:06:07] heymomimonttv: thats sad
[1:06:14] heymomimonttv: mythics boring af to watch
[1:06:15] ralotheret: don‚Äôt die ez
[1:06:17] tolginyoo: just wait until the DKs go OOM
[1:06:33] enviscerate: @heymomimonttv 90% of wow players are pve'ers tbf
[1:06:34] jawsh_man: Is disc supposed to feel weak asf in solo q or is my wotlk mind bad for retail? don‚Äôt answer the 2nd part
[1:06:35] reavethederp: dam
[1:06:44] heymomimonttv: @enviscerate yea im fully aware just boring lol
[1:07:14] Nevillus: play fire arcane is zzz
[1:07:23] Saitistreamy: @enviscerate thats largely because they have let arena become super undesirable
[1:07:23] tolginyoo: PvE ResidentSleeper
[1:07:23] joyrex_j9: imagine if one of them played dark sim and stole sheep
[1:07:37] seyvyur: they should make the enchants grindable for lower ratings.  something like 100 wins above 2100, 500 wins above 1800, or 1000 wins above 1600.  So it's doable for everyone, but its more of a grind at lower ratings
[1:07:41] Saitistreamy: @enviscerate not many people want to play the same game since TBC
[1:08:01] Sosatko: @seyvyur Lol so is there just supposed to be 0 achievement for higher rated p eople?
[1:08:11] Saitistreamy: @Sosatko its called R1
[1:08:13] reavethederp: niiice
[1:08:19] rainmakerwow: !talents
[1:08:19] heymomimonttv: @Sosatko you get glad/r1 lol
[1:08:19] Nightbot: Here is a list of all the different talent builds I use: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[1:08:19] Spaceberry_McDuck: sheff gonna have a bad time
[1:08:22] seyvyur: no, theres still titles and glad mounts
[1:08:31] seyvyur: just give something that low ratings can grind
[1:08:40] tolginyoo: i disagree with everything being  a grind, some shit should be skill based :)
[1:08:41] Sosatko: Get better grind rating
[1:08:43] Sosatko: and youll get it tho
[1:08:54] Saitistreamy: I get it every season
[1:08:55] crawnpocktail: i mean, just keeping distance is ccing a punchmonk right?
[1:08:57] Saitistreamy: its still stupid
[1:09:01] rainmakerwow: @venruki no arcane mage talents under the command :(
[1:09:04] Nevillus: hard to do that when glads are fighting you on alts at 1800
[1:09:07] Saitistreamy: more players = better for everyone
[1:09:39] seyvyur: bad players need an incentive to keep playing, so having something grindable at lower ratings helps that
[1:09:44] Dues: Pvp needs more incentives between 1800 and 2400
[1:09:53] bollskis: they need them for this round obv
[1:09:56] rainmakerwow: GIVE ME ARCANE MAGE TALENTS OR I RIOT
[1:10:07] Nevillus: YT!
[1:10:09] Saitistreamy: the systems surrounding arena need a rework
[1:10:13] Saitistreamy: like M+ was
[1:10:27] Nevillus: there's one way to fix arena
[1:10:31] Nevillus: and thats nerf demon hunters
[1:10:33] jawsh_man: you guys should become game developers
[1:10:39] Saitistreamy: pays too little
[1:10:47] serratedlove: they should make duelist 2 at 2250
[1:10:53] Roxxybolts: I swear they need to reamp the pvp system and make it a tier like you talked about and make whatever tier you ended at give a tmog or title/ something that is noticeable..
[1:11:07] Nevillus: so LOL rules?
[1:11:16] jawsh_man: $80k isn‚Äôt exactly little
[1:11:23] tolginyoo: @serratedlove duelist 2 at 2200, duelist 2,5 at 2250, duelist 3 at 2300
[1:11:23] Saitistreamy: Yeah it is
[1:11:24] jawsh_man: I make 85 and do well for myself
[1:11:25] southparkbbb: sheffcurry is a menace

[1:12:12] Zeniticon: xeek 6-0 ?
[1:12:20] Saitistreamy: Retweet roxxybolts
[1:12:30] reaperz14: What would babooshka do
[1:12:31] Nevillus: @Roxxybolts That's what the do in league of legends
[1:12:39] tolginyoo: why don't they make a different color of glad mount for solo shuffle
[1:12:42] Roxxybolts: yeah they have a good system
[1:12:55] Saitistreamy: Most games use the league system now
[1:12:59] Saitistreamy: hell even overwatch does
[1:13:02] Nevillus: have you tried getting outta silver in LOL to find dudes in gold are worse :L
[1:13:32] gr_faux: started gearing my arcane mage last night had some really clean games!
[1:13:33] CabinetMistake: might be cringe but i wouldn't mind a like FREE battlepass where you just earn rewards through conq or honor gained in rated pvp
[1:13:41] reavethederp: oh shit
[1:13:43] CabinetMistake: every season?
[1:13:51] heymomimonttv: @CabinetMistake isnt that the trading post?
[1:14:01] Saitistreamy: the trading post is a HUGE success
[1:14:09] Saitistreamy: expanding it isnt a bad idea at all
[1:14:10] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy broadcloak_ WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:14:14] crawnpocktail: @CabinetMistake like the vicious mount but with more rewards?
[1:14:27] CabinetMistake: ye just like more cosmetics/mounts/titles etc
[1:14:33] rainmakerwow: @venruki can i get arcane mage talents after this SS?
[1:14:48] crawnpocktail: @rainmakerwow if its free and doesnt mention battlepass then yeah sure
[1:15:05] rainmakerwow: @crawnpocktail are we getting a pass in wow xD?
[1:15:07] Nevillus: why dont they go mage at higher ratings :L at 2k its just slap the mage
[1:15:15] serratedlove: surely wow wont have a battle pass since it's already sub based
[1:15:27] serratedlove: COPIUM
[1:15:34] heymomimonttv: @Nevillus most higher rated mages will be able to kite
[1:15:35] Saitistreamy: @serratedlove wow is about to be on game pass lol
[1:15:36] crawnpocktail: @serratedlove trading post is already basically that
[1:15:38] zerx_gg: yoooooooooooooo
[1:15:48] Zeniticon: you can feel the mage gameplay from the comments
[1:15:50] Nevillus: @heymomimonttv nah dont believe that for a second :L
[1:15:53] CabinetMistake: @serratedlove ffxiv does a free one and the pvp is cringe but the battlepass is fun to work through every season
[1:15:55] Saitistreamy: MSFT basically bought blizzard to expand game pass
[1:16:00] Saitistreamy: they are setting up to be the ntflx of gaming
[1:16:19] maxdoesmath: he stole coccoon lol
[1:16:24] rainmakerwow: @Saitistreamy if they add wow subb to xbox game pass that is amzing
[1:16:38] rainmakerwow: id rather pay just xbox game pass than sub + xbox
[1:16:48] crawnpocktail: @rainmakerwow yeah until they monetize wow beyond all recognition
[1:16:51] Saitistreamy: its only a matter of time for that
[1:16:51] pr0x365: Good morning Ven!

[1:17:46] crawnpocktail: we used to pay 10 a month for the best customer service in gaming, now its literally just to be able to spend more money. LUL
[1:18:02] prably: tunnel visioned
[1:18:03] tritonxlol: he needed to just port away or stay in zone
[1:18:08] tritonxlol: until fdk burst over

[1:18:19] Killshotz_24: Just gotta go zug zug bro
[1:18:30] Nevillus: then they shout at you for nto using poly :L
[1:18:32] obviouslytai: i mean a lot of aoe talents shouldnt be taken for most classes
[1:18:33] stealthwalker99: que arcane on venruki instead

[1:19:16] carrvve: yes
[1:19:16] rainmakerwow: @venruki ur chat is very mad for blizz getting owned by microsoft.. i say it's better just to pay for game pass xbox + every 2 years an xpac than all these different subs... xbox game pass has valorant, lol. dota... pretty much amazon prime of gaming
[1:19:18] lordelenath: you have to play a skill class like ret in solo shuffle to have fun.
[1:19:18] Ifwuzzy: play with jelly

[1:20:10] rainmakerwow: @Saitistreamy crawn is :P

[1:20:24] Sosatko: kekw
[1:20:31] obviouslytai: lol thats the vibes i get everytime i get on. Whens the next dh
[1:20:38] Saitistreamy: @crawnpocktail they need it for subs, rather then just cash cowing it
[1:20:54] Nevillus: why are all fire mages rocking haste spec? I swapped and droped from 2300 to 1800 went back mastery spec back up to 2.2k again :L
[1:20:59] Zeniticon: 2x kul tiran ?

[1:21:18] crawnpocktail: @rainmakerwow i just have the vision my guy
[1:21:24] davErosEe: ele mage sounds decent, you can kite a dh to a point with roots and static field
[1:21:29] zerx_gg: assterge lol
[1:21:30] gdodmebxu: assterge monkaTOS
[1:21:32] Badasti: i think you should do it, or play thunder with the Jelly
[1:21:33] heymomimonttv: assterge is his ele version of babooshka hahaha
[1:21:38] Sosatko: @davErosEe No MS
[1:21:42] obviouslytai: kite a dh LOL
[1:21:45] fiestashaman: I used to be a 1600 arena player - but now I‚Äôm a 2400xp demon hunter thank you for the recommendation
[1:21:47] Sosatko: damage is to easily healed without a ms imo
[1:21:50] Roxxybolts: can confirm you can kite a DH
[1:21:52] Zeniticon: shaman healers are hard tho
[1:21:55] Roxxybolts: that ele made me wanna break something
[1:21:57] gdodmebxu: @fiestashaman KEKW
[1:21:59] rainmakerwow: 9/10 top arcane mages in the world are EU in SS lmao
[1:22:02] crawnpocktail: @Saitistreamy i have my doubts, just look at the influx of shop additions and how bad blizzard has been recently (diablo horse for example)
[1:22:02] Bluguieghe: i feel like melee gapclose too easy :P
[1:22:05] reavethederp: eyyy
[1:22:23] heymomimonttv: i think fire pumps pretty damn hard with ele ngl
[1:22:24] zerx_gg: there's literally 3 mages in EU
[1:22:35] Saitistreamy: @crawnpocktail they are turning ship right now, Hence the cleaning house
[1:22:43] fiestashaman: @gdodmebxu I have mastered the arena
[1:22:45] hogx: looking for a healer to snipe some random mage / sham 2s team, i have 5 bm hunters, pst
[1:22:50] Saitistreamy: @crawnpocktail we dont know what this all means yet, it'll be a year down the line.
[1:22:50] crawnpocktail: @Saitistreamy wishful thinking ^^
[1:22:54] gdodmebxu: @fiestashaman dh is FINALLY viable
[1:22:58] QwQGolden: as an eu person with 0 bias, its easily kubzy's mage as #1 this season lets not cap
[1:22:58] rainmakerwow: i was looking for talents.. on murlok website... and checked "top solo shuffle arcane mages" top 9 are EU, 10th is NA... just made me lol a little bit
[1:23:02] Saitistreamy: @crawnpocktail No...I'm just a stock market guy lol
[1:23:05] rainmakerwow: *not implying eu>na*
[1:23:08] fiestashaman: it can still die in stun tho so not meta @gdodmebxu
[1:23:15] gdodmebxu: @fiestashaman true!!!!!
[1:23:18] crawnpocktail: @Saitistreamy that means less than my qualifications and i'll leave it at that
[1:23:26] zerx_gg: those 9 mages are all Thesia/Maro/Raiku
[1:23:27] zerx_gg: anyway
[1:23:41] obviouslytai: diff amount of people = different rating inflation
[1:23:42] rainmakerwow: yea the ratings... i don't say EU > NA... not that type of thing... just wondering who no high rated arcana mages in NA
[1:24:30] Saitistreamy: @crawnpocktail I mean unless your in tech as part of operations or strategy , I dont agree lol
[1:24:46] crawnpocktail: @Saitistreamy rukiGrin
[1:25:18] zerx_gg: pognova
[1:25:54] heymomimonttv: wow rogue takes a full ray and comes out of cloak max hp
[1:26:07] bjjamm: !talents
[1:26:07] Nightbot: Here is a list of all the different talent builds I use: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[1:26:27] lowluds: HeyGuys
[1:26:52] stealthwalker99: They need to reduce the health back down and increase damage. sophic/trinket proc is where the random burst dam came from nerf that instead
[1:27:04] Spaceberry_McDuck: this is why i hate twos, lol
[1:27:13] Nadasky: Unkillable targets is like the #1 game-killer for me. Most unfun thing ever
[1:27:20] Nadasky: Sadge
[1:27:25] reavethederp: SAdge
[1:27:27] addyz0r: 25%mana till they take dam

[1:35:14] SwiisH_Tv: It is a damp fest now, but werent people not long ago not happy about how high damage was?
[1:35:15] addyz0r: i really dont like to watch when the game starts after 10mins bluebar

[1:35:43] raspador: HELL NO
[1:35:44] lucaskerkoff: Dropped off from WOW a long long time ago... But it has been nice watching you play retail tbh... I like the arena vibes and plays you have bro.  Have a wonderful day as well !! Greetings from Brazil
[1:35:46] addyz0r: one is so much better
[1:35:53] SwiisH_Tv: i agree, im just stating no one in this game is ever happy it seems
[1:36:00] shrimpsmacker: i like longer games tbh
[1:36:01] gr_faux: arcane mm 2s games ends fast hahaha
[1:36:05] crawnpocktail: just make sure you dont auto lose to 1800 rmp and youre fine (in  anon-damp meta)
[1:36:07] addyz0r: at least one game is over and you can send again
[1:36:13] addyz0r: if you wanna play m+ go pve
[1:36:59] SwiisH_Tv: Again im only stating a couple months ago the forums were filled with nerf damage this and that. They did now everyone is complaining its damp. When are we happy? lol
[1:37:15] shrimpsmacker: never ^
[1:37:25] SwiisH_Tv: @shrimpsmacker this is the correct answer lol
[1:37:44] addyz0r: well tuning damage and health to make people immortal wasnt what people said
[1:37:44] astrry: I love variety, I think it's cool when you queue one evening and meet many different comps and setups, dampen meta makes it so every team is druid + 2 m+ dps guys
[1:37:53] addyz0r: they said nerf a few high burst classes
[1:38:13] pattarx: game is very damp but comps like ele dh can still kill 60-0 in 0.5
[1:38:36] stealthwalker99: For me (Soph 2 weapons+Trinket Proc)*1.12 = 4400 primary stat. This is where the random 1 shot damage was coming from they just needed to lower this
[1:38:42] shrimpsmacker: this is really just a high mmr problem though in low mmr people die fast
[1:38:48] davErosEe: if people get one shot without popping defensives, that‚Äôs fine
[1:39:03] SwiisH_Tv: @shrimpsmacker this is also correct under 1800 people still flop
[1:39:05] keenomglol: Jellybeans is such a sweetie üåπ
[1:40:13] shrimpsmacker: Jelly is awesome :)
[1:40:14] nameyourform: 2s is like watching grass grow
[1:40:40] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: Hot Take Incoming- I feel like they only increased stamina the last time to nerf sub rogue instead of actually nerfing sub rogue not going to lie. I think they need to revert the last stamina change. Keep the armor change, and nerf sub rogue directly to compensate (Along with some other balancing) just my two cents! the meta is actually really good right now though. Lots of really fun classes!
[1:40:43] addyz0r: 5m isnt the worst
[1:41:06] nikjames101: Hey ven you don't have mana showing on your party frames
[1:41:18] jxke_xo: no rewards for 2s :(
[1:42:13] NerdEngineering: what is this craziness...? Jelly healing and a non-Orc WW
[1:42:17] What_ln_Tarnation: your monk is looking cute today
[1:42:25] Zeniticon: i tried 50% mastery on frost mage, it pumps but you cant really cast anything

[1:42:26] famous1939: now idk how to talk without it LUL
[1:42:30] shrimpsmacker: sounding like Roxxy
[1:43:29] tarth_100: they just need to give up and give mages a stun already
[1:44:18] beedl0: @tarth_100 please don't. just make fire dam good again (MFGA)
[1:45:18] addyz0r: texan mes xD
[1:45:58] animeintrovibes: means youre a weeb
[1:46:03] tarth_100: kage of the wind

[1:46:11] foxyllama: god imagine how soft and warm jellyussy  is
[1:46:18] tarth_100: isnt that just a naruto thing
[1:46:51] butanesoup69: @foxyllama way ahead of u
[1:47:15] What_ln_Tarnation: kaze means wind, its why kamikaze means divine wind

[1:50:37] Skompa: Hey Venruki, I have always played classic and hav never really gave retail a try. I love PvP and the competitiveness, am I wrong or might retail be better in that aspect with arena and everything? Should I give it a try? :)
[1:51:01] Cocoapuffs1: thats cool they changed the boat in sw to a love boat
[1:51:03] gr_faux: retail pog
[1:51:04] Cocoapuffs1: never noticed
[1:51:06] Zeniticon: its called DH
[1:51:07] dipicat: is jelly talking about rogues or is jelly talking about rogues
[1:51:26] rockxtv: then we have slands RMP mirrors
[1:51:36] Aramith9: bm or war

[1:52:53] gr_faux: I have no interest in playing the game it was 15 years ago
[1:53:09] obviouslytai: needs end game time sinks
[1:53:14] obviouslytai: or rating
[1:53:22] storm_chaser_ron: @Cocoapuffs1 what is wrong with you
[1:53:25] lowpoint0: whats the best way to get gear once youve gotten full honor gear?
[1:53:38] Locturnal_TV: more dumb atm
[1:53:43] Cocoapuffs1: @Cocoapuffs1 EleGiggle
[1:53:46] ATHLTE: fw is bonkers too
[1:53:50] gr_faux: 0 respect for anyone who plays dh
[1:53:55] What_ln_Tarnation: DH presses deathsweep, you lose half your hp
[1:54:00] davErosEe: I find my rogue and dh require similar effort
[1:54:14] lordelenath: but DH is great for ppl like me who can't reach 2k on any other class. there has to be smth for us, right?
[1:54:16] Cocoapuffs1: @storm_chaser_ron tell me every1 wouldnt despise that comp tho
[1:54:28] gr_faux: bologna, dh is for smooth brain Andy‚Äôs
[1:55:20] NerdEngineering: I was so excited for the new trees in DF, but its created this meta where classes like rogue and DH have 30 impactful abilities. Micro CCs, Defensives, movement, its endless. I still enjoy retail, but certain classes def one the spec lottery.
[1:55:42] What_ln_Tarnation: EZ
[1:55:43] wowsuomi: Don't hear this very often

[1:56:32] Dwilk20: @NerdEngineering Funny you didnt mention Ret/warrior considering they both sat at the top of solo for 7months
[1:56:35] lucaskerkoff: you do pump dude, makes me want to go back to play wow and revive my WW from 5 years ago
[1:56:47] NerdEngineering: @Dwilk20 They were def insane for a bit

[2:00:04] beedl0: Venruki, btw. I'm playing mage with a lock and the most success we had was actually destro + full mastery fire, but around 2k we start seeing dh that know where there buttons are and it goes to shit. Should we play other specs? Should I play arcane?
[2:02:25] ooPickleRicKoo: hello people. I hope everyone is having a good day
[2:02:31] obviouslytai: insane peels from the ruki

[2:04:13] beedl0: Frost seems cooked :(
[2:04:27] flarpa88: is there a dr for the verse stat? or should i keep stacking vers? like a soft cap?
[2:04:35] Roxxybolts: we need the jellussy to heal us
[2:04:36] Pradathelord: mastery fire is pretty good into a lot of stuff
[2:04:43] gdodmebxu: @flarpa88 softcap is 30% and depends on your class
[2:04:46] Pradathelord: some caster stuff
[2:05:02] gr_faux: as arcane what should my double dps 2s partner be without rogue? too many terrible rogues
[2:05:09] Aklipto: do you when my and the go to the at all for the arena?
[2:05:17] flarpa88: for priest should i stop at 30%v then?
[2:05:26] animeintrovibes: probably just have to spin the cord around and have it lay in 1 position where it never moves
[2:06:21] shanerrrs: @Aklipto man you're all over the place whats your question
[2:06:24] Pradathelord: we do need that petition
[2:06:34] gr_faux: as arcane what should my double dps 2s partner be without rogue? too many terrible rogues
[2:06:42] deepTTV: but if we do that. sub rogues will come back and this will buff DH even more @venruki
[2:07:05] lasergazer3: How one side breaks? There's a "master" side, that has a cable that leads to the other side. If the cable fails in anyway, the one side works and the other doesnt
[2:07:07] obviouslytai: yea but isnt time to kill already slow anyways
[2:07:34] obviouslytai: and dh damage kekw
[2:07:34] storm_chaser_ron: consistent damage out of procs should be good
[2:07:36] Pradathelord: nerf stamina and they could some buff stuff that's not bad
[2:07:48] ooPickleRicKoo: man I am trying to learn rdruid. it feels difficult.. need to set up a ton of macros and shit
[2:07:49] gritngrind81: 783 for 15 mms
[2:07:50] stealthwalker99: 1900*1.12 = 2128 primary stat shouldn't be a thing
[2:07:59] storm_chaser_ron: you guys are gonna get papa ven's life lessons about stacking modifiers
[2:08:02] gritngrind81: sec*
[2:08:14] storm_chaser_ron: gather round children
[2:08:14] Pradathelord: do you remember in mop when they made pve trinkets longer duration but weaker from the standpoint of burst?
[2:08:39] obviouslytai: i think time to kill isnt that bad tbh. i think healers r just very strong
[2:08:54] gdodmebxu: that honor talent shouldn't exist
[2:10:19] NerdEngineering: rogues with their infinite defensive CDs...
[2:10:52] Nateypww: I love venruki
[2:11:41] Cocoapuffs1: when was it they gave the cloak pvp talent to rogue?
[2:12:26] BMaStream: lol

[2:15:24] itz_killjoy: there is no way faeline stomp covered the floor like that before

[2:27:13] gr_faux: cut the steam change in half we would be in a decent spot imo
[2:27:14] baxter5569: stam change d back would mess up shuffle though :( in regular 3s i could say its different
[2:27:20] Zeniticon: before the patch i could 90-0 ppl in shuffle in 1.9 sec  RIP
[2:27:21] baxter5569: u need the buffer in shuffe
[2:27:23] gr_faux: stam change*
[2:27:34] clemestos: What's that addon where it shows the enemy cd being uses next to the right of there hp bar?
[2:27:40] baxter5569: most rounds end in 1-2 minutes
[2:27:49] Ultramagnus85: whichever is more popular
[2:27:51] emergencxyz: Just make dampening in 3s start a bit sooner
[2:27:52] Judgejobrown: "earthernlol" KEKW
[2:27:59] Jamzy: thats because damp is quicker in shuff
[2:28:00] Pradathelord: shuffle damp
[2:28:04] Pradathelord: not wrong
[2:28:05] CabinetMistake: let's do it
[2:28:06] xfeedgodx: i agree
[2:28:09] emergencxyz: I think it could start at 10%
[2:28:09] Pradathelord: with this level of stam and nobody likes damp
[2:28:11] ooPickleRicKoo: exactly
[2:28:12] tomzartheravenlord: Can people get to Rival in SS?
[2:28:14] Pradathelord: they should just do that, lets get it
[2:28:19] baxter5569: @emergencxyz it does just ramps up slower
[2:28:22] bollskis: do u think we'll get tweaks before eu vs na
[2:28:29] CabinetMistake: @tomzartheravenlord rival is 1800 ye?
[2:28:52] knadam13: as a healer no thanks. shuffle damp is awful
[2:29:10] biofreaks: Damp shouldnt even be a thing. There should be some burst, but mostly constant steady pressure?
[2:29:25] Cocoapuffs1: some healers just straight up do nothing at certains points of damp quicker than others is the problem
[2:29:27] Ultramagnus85: guess he was trying to prevent bop from getting stolen
[2:30:36] wicked_wizurd: i think dps are to tanky tbh nothing dies without cross cc and huge burst before dampening
[2:31:09] Zeniticon: he's saying everyone is bad
[2:31:29] heymomimonttv: playing damp/oom means that it gives people more room for error because the game won't end until then
[2:31:32] tomzartheravenlord: @CabinetMistake Yes

[3:26:34] Alyxsandr: dont eat the kids!
[3:26:50] Hobblefoot: Hellloooooooooo Everyone!
[3:27:21] Pradathelord: yeah
[3:27:35] Hobblefoot: Yeah. They are the most fun spec in the game to boot!
[3:27:41] Tippolippo: hmmm should I boost a destro and ditch my mage
[3:27:46] Tippolippo: sounds like it
[3:27:56] heymomimonttv: @Tippolippo judging by awc, yes
[3:28:08] FateIRL: dh is the god class rn
[3:28:36] R1_Prototype: @camrencyber  my favorite part is how we care enough about health to air fry the nuggets, instead of oil fry. but not enough to not eat Dino Nuggets. True and Real.
[3:28:37] davErosEe: dh is probably #3
[3:29:07] zachgamegodx: @daverosee what‚Äôs #1
[3:29:12] Salanzo: idk man i dont really cast
[3:29:13] five_moke: vengeance DH is the best mage spec
[3:29:16] FateIRL: outlaw rogue
[3:29:21] Hobblefoot: When I play my mage alt I feel like I cannot hurt Lock at all.
[3:29:25] davErosEe: rogue, then Destro then dh
[3:29:29] R1_Prototype: I think vengeful retreat should have a longer cooldown. that ability is broken.
[3:29:47] baxter5569: rating gate keepers :(
[3:29:47] zachgamegodx: no outlaws not better than DH sorry
[3:30:06] five_moke: 100%
[3:30:07] FateIRL: yes
[3:30:07] Hobblefoot: No
[3:30:09] Bonegraft: NO
[3:30:11] FateIRL: nothing is unique anymore
[3:30:12] theodeth: not really
[3:30:17] BMaStream: Yes, healers shouldn't all have access to kicks
[3:30:24] Bruchteil: kind of yes
[3:30:34] five_moke: ever class has the same abilities with different names.
[3:30:39] leeka: the general class tree shares too much, like shadowdance with all specs
[3:30:51] Zeniticon: remove infinite mobillity on melees
[3:30:58] freelofear: if u take away my kick as hpally, I will scream
[3:31:06] leeka: @Zeniticon itll never happen, pve change.
[3:31:09] Peachxp_: like demo lock getting 25% MS, why?
[3:31:11] five_moke: !song
[3:31:12] Nightbot: Enable the AHA Music Identifier to find out the song! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-music-identifie/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en
[3:31:12] heymomimonttv: yea like arms has 50% sweeping uptime, 70% dmg. DH has 100% 100%
[3:31:19] zachgamegodx: you can kite a ww
[3:31:35] khrylx_: casters complaining about ww is the most hilarious thing
[3:31:36] lordwizardmonk: who complains about kiting a ww lmao, they are so easy to absolutely shut down,. must be a bad player
[3:31:59] Hobblefoot: Okay so I get the point in some ways.  Like every class has Mortal Strike minus a few outliers. I feel like it did not used to be that way.
[3:32:04] pragma90: mhortai summed it up perfectly
[3:32:11] pragma90: @Hobblefoot hi
[3:32:14] Salanzo: buff destro
[3:32:40] zachgamegodx: @lordwizardmonk that‚Äôs not true either, you can kite them but they‚Äôll eventually connect dmg
[3:32:48] troliveca: nerf ele shaman and DH for 20% and pop is gonna be great!
[3:32:50] affablebeef: why arent random bgs a standard stat curve? i feel like casual bgs should be just that casual and no need for any sort of gearing or very minimal upscale with gear
[3:32:52] Hobblefoot: @pragma90 Hello!
[3:32:57] nameyourform: we have been saying this stuff all exp. nothing has changed. nor will it
[3:33:08] style5z: casual bgS SHOULD be balanced on ilvl and nothing else
[3:33:10] khrylx_: @zachgamegodx after sitting micro cc for 10 years
[3:33:14] brezkovtv: tbc was the best
[3:33:17] bitcoinonlyfans: buff Fistweaver?
[3:33:19] style5z: having ppl in full pvp gear joining BGs just to pump naked ppl who are farming is alme as shit
[3:33:22] lordwizardmonk: @zachgamegodx maybe at an mmr of like 2100ish but eve on my lock I haev no problem kiting a ww, then again though I am playing with players who also know how to shut them down
[3:33:22] ALLtheEXP: nelfussy
[3:33:22] troliveca: nerf ele shaman and DH for 20% and pvp is gonna be great!
[3:33:24] Ignite_CLO: unrated bgs are either getting stomped because your team has no gear, or you destroy the other team because they dont have ggear
[3:33:26] What_ln_Tarnation: NELFUSSY Pog
[3:33:27] CHMage: Ive always been poor in gold because I only do pvp
[3:33:29] Peachxp_: foxy take best take
[3:33:38] EliteDamit: foxy huh WutFace
[3:33:38] Moobot: Latest video "UPDATED 10.2.5 PvP Tier List! EVERY SPEC RANKED!" view it here: youtu.be/E2wCZf3wKiM
[3:33:39] heymomimonttv: foxy only knows how to say out of pocket shit lmao
[3:33:46] StromicusRex: LOL
[3:33:47] LordRatigan: I think they mean Dynamic que
[3:33:56] troliveca: nerf ele shaman and DH for 20% and pvp is gonna be great!
[3:34:07] Ignite_CLO: this scripe guy must be new at wow
[3:34:19] heymomimonttv: ele sham doesnt even feel broken anymore
[3:34:27] nameyourform: can u show the video
[3:34:29] nameyourform: @venruki
[3:34:38] ArdellanDH: I thought that was for sub
[3:34:52] CHMage: the need of addons is something that should not exist. Blizzard should gatter what is most used and implement in the UI in a customizable way without the need of addons @venruki
[3:35:00] famous1939: it's a step focus kick with a mouseover cursor back to the locatoin
[3:35:03] Hobblefoot: You mean grappling hook I believe
[3:35:04] ALLtheEXP: This will never ever change but, I think the inclusion/necessity of Macros and Addons is another unfun part of pvp. Talk about a barrier to entry
[3:35:04] famous1939: pretty neat
[3:35:11] sourbutts: thats a game ruiner for sure
[3:35:27] What_ln_Tarnation: because rogues are a hero class
[3:35:28] ATHLTE: cuz rogues are 2 expansions ahead xD
[3:35:28] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Degothi WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[3:35:28] xoHOLLOW: death grip global
[3:35:29] nameyourform: show the clip
[3:35:32] Saitistreamy: Macro support is actually weird, and makes wow skill partly based around doing homework
[3:35:38] ArdellanDH: It's the same for DH
[3:35:47] FateIRL: rogues need to be oppressive Kappa
[3:35:50] What_ln_Tarnation: @ArdellanDH dh mobility def on global
[3:35:55] gotham_kr: that macro has risks though. if the focus target melds or vanishes, the step kick wouldnt work and grapple would just be wasted
[3:35:58] ArdellanDH: Yupp
[3:36:00] Yaycarrots: nerf ret
[3:36:03] nameyourform: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AX9_nbP3DE
[3:36:17] ATHLTE: buff casted mw
[3:36:22] Pradathelord: macro is pretty niche but interesting
[3:36:23] ATHLTE: remove fw
[3:36:28] What_ln_Tarnation: D:
[3:36:32] Locturnal_TV: that rogue is a bot, he was botting on ele last season
[3:36:57] davErosEe: rogue is def a bottable class
[3:36:59] FateIRL: hes harpooning before the kick goes off
[3:37:03] FateIRL: love to see it
[3:37:09] R1_Prototype: delete MW healers. redesign. do it again.
[3:37:17] Salanzo: need the macro for science and research purposes
[3:37:18] What_ln_Tarnation: @El_Capitan_Live D: Û†ÄÄ
[3:37:21] elmeror: what macro is that ven? Kappa
[3:37:31] What_ln_Tarnation: rogue
[3:37:32] FateIRL: rdruid
[3:37:33] nikthevoker: DH

[3:37:36] ATHLTE: dh
[3:37:36] imanorclock: DH
[3:37:36] heymomimonttv: rogue or DH
[3:37:38] LordRatigan: Not outlaw or DH

[3:38:04] What_ln_Tarnation: D:
[3:38:14] xoHOLLOW: D:
[3:38:15] nameyourform: yeah if u go to LFG to find 3s or 2s everyones bio says "LF DH"
[3:38:16] davErosEe: low rating dh, high rating rogue
[3:38:23] ArdellanDH: Ugh fistweavers are hard to play with
[3:38:24] What_ln_Tarnation: they dont want me D:
[3:38:29] five_moke: dh is skil class stop with the copium üß¢
[3:38:29] khrylx_: so why did no one say ww if its so broken? i wonder why
[3:38:42] Gizzlefsb: why has it taken blizzard so long to nerf dh?
[3:39:09] chubmax: its so true.   on a sub-based game the devs are absolutely pathetic
[3:39:16] leeka: we've had 1 round of changes since xmas right?
[3:39:17] What_ln_Tarnation: i feel like as of late, all devs full steam on nex xpac
[3:39:24] MaybeRespect: This guy still saying melee is BIS lol?
[3:39:25] gibboking: they should make healers in solo not get 0 rating for 3 wins......1 bad dps who gets 0 wins just cucks both healers
[3:39:27] Gizzlefsb: DH/Rdruid/Rsham need nerf, buff hpally
[3:39:30] R1_Prototype: to make healers balanced. they would have to make priest scream be targetable. priests are so telegraphed because of screams range.
[3:39:33] FateIRL: nothing dies
[3:39:40] Saitistreamy: they could do half the stamina change they did
[3:39:42] Zeniticon: just up damage instead
[3:39:42] sourbutts: only benefits Hold W classes/comps
[3:39:49] khrylx_: well it really plays into locks opness
[3:39:50] ArdellanDH: It's like call of duty, just run in and do damage
[3:39:50] Bruchteil: then u play an too high rating Kappa
[3:40:07] What_ln_Tarnation: 1800 mog is free atm
[3:40:10] TrippThree: Cant please everyone... Someone will always cry.
[3:40:27] Zeniticon: boosters gatekeepign 1800s
[3:40:33] five_moke: blizzard proved early on that they have the capacity to make changes mid season/xpac‚Ä¶ then they just stopped making tuning changes and just let things be unbalanced
[3:40:41] R3t4ard: Does anyone know how to toggle the icons on MES WA, i only get the sound
[3:40:47] chubmax: what are these comments all in response ot?
[3:40:50] R1_Prototype: @trippthree I agree, but that‚Äôs literally their job. pleasing their customers.
[3:40:57] kreyzy8: blizz decided people shouldn't be able to gain rating outside of the last 2 weeks of the season this xpac for some reason
[3:41:13] Peachxp_: why isnt shuffle just a total lobby mmr
[3:41:31] bigpancakeflapjacks: Every class has everything
[3:41:32] hooqs: healing tide is insta dead man
[3:41:32] nameyourform: i think Micro cc in wow is the worst thing ever, i dont mind sitting a 6 sec fear, but then after that, 3 sec coil, 3 axe toss, Dr axe toss, so on and on
[3:41:53] tomzartheravenlord: I noticed when you have shaman or BM hunters in shuffles or so - too many targets to hit, you don't know who to hit
[3:41:56] Pradathelord: i think so much healing being in totems is bad too tho
[3:42:01] Bruchteil: i found it completely unreal, how fast spirit links died in awc arenas
[3:42:02] clicket: LUL
[3:42:03] Blitzylive: dont do it
[3:42:05] nfrois: I actually had a ton of fun healing in s2 but when s3 came out i couldn't be bothered to start crafting and gearing all my  healers again. Even if its easy i can't deal with gearing anymore, i just want to log in and play like i do in every single pvp game.
[3:42:10] shogun2022: the problem is not cc, I actually miss the pre cc nerf gameplay
[3:42:13] khrylx_: the caster micro cc and spam cc is what makes ww so absolutely depressing to play actually
[3:42:16] affablebeef: just gotta big brain and use healing tide as a peel for teammates. people just 'w' key to it nowadays
[3:42:20] five_moke: more like demon hunter‚Ä¶ amirite
[3:42:32] tomzartheravenlord: DH

[3:43:58] sourbutts: all tank specs are toxic
[3:43:59] EjaVuDay: there will always be specs no matter they balance that people will view as OP
[3:44:01] Peachxp_: if a enh plays well they are annoying to fight and can help teamamtess and win if they dont use tools they do nothing and die KEKW
[3:44:04] shogun2022: DKs so weak to melee rn tho
[3:44:10] Cephqt: abom grips you once
[3:44:11] pr0x365: RDruids
[3:44:14] Cephqt: and it does no damage now
[3:44:21] DrunkJoe14: can I say that I find it obnoxious that us in the pvp q always just complain about meta and nerfing classes instead of buffing up the weak ones except punch monk f that spec
[3:44:38] Salanzo: are u not in Q on ur mage
[3:44:47] Atlas62: We had some good games playing FMP
[3:44:52] tomzartheravenlord: I wish I could enjoy my main spec, demo lock, but I know for a fact it is really unforgiving and requires a ramp up to get it going
[3:44:59] Zeniticon: sitting cc for 30 sec
[3:45:07] shogun2022: I think ramping is a part of the meta
[3:45:09] twinbladeuk: Main problem is as dps player in LFG Healer leaves after a loss

[3:45:49] notoriousztv: yeah this community has 1800 rated players that talk like theyre 10x r1 tho
[3:45:51] gritngrind81: its social issue

[3:45:55] khrylx_: @ATHLTE no it comes from being an idiot
[3:45:56] casper24411442: Nobody likes losing
[3:45:57] EjaVuDay: Halo 2 was super fun at high levels
[3:45:59] indrah___: go and play league that game is toxic af and i love it
[3:46:01] nameyourform: nikvoker
[3:46:04] pragma90: @notoriousztv this
[3:46:05] jontepman: Think a lot of people just grew out of Wow and hate it for some reason but they cant make themselves stop playing
[3:46:05] Bruchteil: thats right
[3:46:06] baxter5569: unless you have everyone on the exact same character. there is always unbalance and people will flock to the strongest
[3:46:13] shogun2022: there are so many variables and paths to victory having everyone on the same page is key
[3:46:18] uaflol: a lot of the arena maps are horrible
[3:46:27] Damiusx: addons / ui - improve the ui for pvp, and lock it. No addons, but base pvp ui improved to be usefull.
[3:46:33] bigpancakeflapjacks: @pradathelord sit in that 30 min solo that's fried
[3:46:36] R1_Prototype: so your saying competitive, sometimes-toxic people, online, are toxic. Yep. in every game.
[3:46:36] prowessj: crazy difficulty cap between classes
[3:46:50] pragma90: bring back unrated solo shuffle to practice with
[3:46:51] Hobblefoot: I am such a fucking outlier....  I never have issues finding partners, I love the complexity of the game and the different modes of play.  I goof around on what ... 10 toon and have fun on all of them.  I think the problem isn't the game as much as it is all of you guys, with all due respect.  I hope you all find a game you love and enjoy.
[3:46:53] checkemcharles: too many buttons
[3:46:59] PastaSeat: They need an ACTUAL ranking system where you progress through tiers
[3:47:13] sourbutts: why not the next hotfix, why do we have to wait until next expacx
[3:47:15] shogun2022: lol such a wow comment
[3:47:18] oOThugnastyOo: I feel like its ok to tell someone they are doing something bad. The problem is the crybabies that can't be criticized and say toxic.
[3:47:22] Atlas62: They just need to lessen the amount of micro CC in the game
[3:47:24] checkemcharles: what a boot licker
[3:47:29] indrah___: yes toxic time
[3:47:31] Blitzylive: its interesting people want Blizzard to address this but pvp has never been a big part of the wow population. Blizzard won't invest where there is no $$$
[3:47:37] Pradathelord: @bigpancakeflapjacks yea thats true but they need to iterate on shit, i think this expansion has been mostly good
[3:47:39] Atlas62: a demon
[3:47:47] Hobblefoot: @shogun2022 LOL I suppose that is true. Hahaha.  Can't argue that.
[3:47:57] elmeror: can i see your talents please ven
[3:47:58] vanlonja: At this point I am just surprised that people think that Blizz might make PvP fun, balanced and accessible. It's been 20 years of this crap, get a clue LUL
[3:48:00] tomzartheravenlord: @venruki When trying to gain ranking in SS, how many matches does it take to actually get to where you wish to be? Is it just dependant on the mindset, on skillset?
[3:48:04] Saitistreamy: @Blitzylive the issue isnt population its rate of return
[3:48:05] gr_faux: when ven plays some gw2 world v world with me I‚Äôll be ready to move on from this life
[3:48:12] Saitistreamy: if 10k people pay subs for pvp
[3:48:14] Saitistreamy: its worth dealing with
[3:48:19] fistweaveurnan: Dragonflight season 1 was insane participation in rss
[3:48:24] smitesucks: the only thing they talk about on sod forums is pvp
[3:48:28] clicket: Didn't holinka debunk that talking point at one point?
[3:48:29] zemm8582: didn't blizzard do a vote for most popular game modes and pvp was second after mythic +?
[3:48:32] clicket: It was a pretty huge percentage
[3:48:40] Spawrro: that isnt true at all, Its probably on equal terms of participations as raiding is
[3:48:44] Saitistreamy: Arena is the fringe thing
[3:48:47] Saitistreamy: pvp is big
[3:48:47] R1_Prototype: I get what he means tho. a LOT of the community looks at everything through their own lenses of truth. people in other games would kill for updates and  patches and competitive PvP. but we just complain about what‚Äôs broken. BUT something IS ALWAYS BROKEN. lol.
[3:48:50] jontepman: Pvp is a huge part of Wow, theres a reason they still host Awc, Sod has a lot of pvp content
[3:49:00] Pradathelord: i like the anology of wow pvp vs  m+...imagine if you couldn't push keys due to the system itself...I bet changes would be made stat
[3:49:00] R3t4ard: Hey @venruki, do you know how to toggle the Icons in  a weakauro? i just downloaded MES WA and i dont seem to get the icons for it only the sound..
[3:49:03] Saitistreamy: we are a small subset of the overall pvp player base
[3:49:08] Saitistreamy: like Mytrhic raid to lfr
[3:49:08] zerx_gg: smells like copium in here
[3:49:11] davErosEe: shuffle expanded pvp player base, rated blitz will even more. don‚Äôt think its fringe anymore
[3:49:16] shogun2022: classic, SOD and hardcore are watering down the player base too kinda I just worry about death by attrition with all the players bleeding out to the other modes
[3:49:23] Hobblefoot: I would say I would love a new Epic BG and Reg BG.  That would be neat.   I also wish people were nicer to each other. There are some mean folk out there!
[3:49:38] bigpancakeflapjacks: @pradathelord if they fixed the que it would be good, unacceptable and unless your a stream there is zero gain to sit in a que that long on a daily basis
[3:49:45] lordwizardmonk: the kind of people playing hardcore arentthe kind of people that will play pvp tbh
[3:49:45] Critmaker1000: am in LFG for more than 3 hours and all requester less then me by 400 rating atlest
[3:49:46] dotadotadotadotaa: everybody in lfg is multiglad or 3k xD
[3:49:49] Symo85: make an EU account
[3:49:54] Blitzylive: Majority of player base has always been PVE. Blizzard isn't going to invest much in PVP
[3:49:57] dotadotadotadotaa: kinda scary for new player
[3:50:03] Pradathelord: @bigpancakeflapjacks the end of both seasons it was fun to q but not until then, big agree
[3:50:03] FateIRL: why dont you play destro?
[3:50:04] ellisrainy: as much as I hate to admit it - I think arena being more "niche" is statistically true. I was blown away to learn how many actual casual casual players there are (only mount farm etc)
[3:50:10] Blitzylive: Sadge but reality
[3:50:20] shogun2022: tbh tho pvp feels like they do put work into it but some of their choices just suck
[3:50:21] casper24411442: Like my zero cr
[3:50:25] ellisrainy: still tho in saying that I still think arena/pvp should have dedicated changes, can't just ignore a % of the playerbase
[3:50:32] Pradathelord: @bigpancakeflapjacks i also hate how we've changed shit like the stam change and stat nerf mid season too, i find it to be really annoying
[3:50:53] Saitistreamy: there is currently no time or reason to que a battleground as an arena player
[3:50:53] Hobblefoot: I love the idea of a PVP Proving Ground that my pal @pragma90 mentioned.  You could make it really fun, moderately challenging and have some small rewards.  I good place to learn.
[3:50:58] Pekaus92: Yooo, you got a link for your bangin playlist?
[3:50:59] R1_Prototype: bg ques are 8 mins rn. so pvp is doing fine?
[3:51:07] Finark_: I'll always love Aff
[3:51:17] shogun2022: I feel like affliction has to play with spriest
[3:51:19] shogun2022: rn
[3:51:22] FinkleTheMage: @Blitzylive Do you think if they actually invested into it more, PvP might actually stand a chance at growing though?
[3:51:23] casper24411442: healer dps 2s is so boring
[3:51:23] heymomimonttv: i wanna see venruki destro gameplay tbh
[3:51:41] sourbutts: affli assass rogue is actually kinda fun
[3:51:50] bigpumperrz: best lobby ever xD
[3:51:55] light_of_heart: D tier
[3:52:03] Tippolippo: Just boosted a destro lock :)
[3:52:03] R1_Prototype: I think healer dps two is fun AF. it puts more on you, the healer, to get involved.
[3:52:15] heymomimonttv: fury is a 2s spec for sure
[3:52:19] Symo85: the map won't help
[3:52:21] Pradathelord: the warrior is like finally, no DH!
[3:52:42] tomzartheravenlord: a question to people - how relevant are tier sets in pvp?
[3:52:48] R1_Prototype: first global disarm.
[3:52:54] bigpancakeflapjacks: @pradathelord don't know why the game still every class has everything some classes have 100% uptime
[3:52:56] heymomimonttv: @tomzartheravenlord extremely
[3:52:57] Onshuffle: @tomzartheravenlord depends on the class
[3:53:20] Spawrro: almost every single spec runs 4pc of tier
[3:53:27] Pradathelord: @bigpancakeflapjacks not EVERYTHING. DH can still get a disarm tbh kappa
[3:53:29] Blitzylive: @FinkleTheMage They may get more to try out PvP but that's the nature of what this game has been for over 10 years. Blizzard isn't going to invest where there isn't much interest.
[3:53:44] sourbutts: @bigpancakeflapjacks DH having 100% uptime is a really big problem for me atm
[3:54:04] heymomimonttv: @sourbutts agreed
[3:54:08] FinkleTheMage: @Blitzylive All I'm saying is, everyone thinks "PvE has always been more popular" and I feel like that's due to Bliz never truly investing into it like they have PvE.
[3:54:17] bigpancakeflapjacks: The biggest problem with this game is now it's exactly like his UI it's all numbers people are just reading data not even playing the game
[3:54:22] shogun2022: a lot of melee get nearly 100% uptime its rough
[3:54:27] shogun2022: dh ret war
[3:54:35] bigpancakeflapjacks: 50 different add-ons the game scripted everybody has the moves
[3:54:56] bigpancakeflapjacks: We got sounds when shit's going on
[3:55:12] davErosEe: dh don‚Äôt play double immo aura anymore so roots prevent their 100% uptime.  snares don‚Äôt do anything
[3:55:49] Pradathelord: @davErosEe they do if they are going to get kited
[3:56:07] Pradathelord: if you can get value from cleansing flames you just play it
[3:56:19] Cocoapuffs1: @bigpancakeflapjacks one of the eu dhs was playing double immo aura most games in awc
[3:56:21] Pingabreath: zzz
[3:56:22] davErosEe: the damage is almost never worth giving up.  they just play cleanse with  1 immo aura usually
[3:56:27] What_ln_Tarnation: remember when somebody rated fury D tier :)
[3:56:35] tomzartheravenlord: I know the feeling there
[3:56:36] bigpancakeflapjacks: I see some streamers they have so many add-ons they can't even see what's any of the characters
[3:56:42] Pradathelord: fury sucks for sure
[3:56:53] Pradathelord: @Cocoapuffs1 this
[3:56:55] heymomimonttv: fury is only good in 2s, against a facetank clothie lol
[3:56:58] Symo85: if you had pillars no way he wins
[3:56:58] zemm8582: can't judge a spec based on 2s anyways
[3:57:08] numero5218: I get lumped up by fury in non 3s
[3:57:18] casper24411442: And it was a warm up game
[3:57:20] Pingabreath: problem is you cant nut run these addons cuz everyone else is running them..
[3:57:22] numero5218: I‚Äôm also shadow and suck
[3:57:56] Tkaaplan: whats ur /played?
[3:58:06] bigpancakeflapjacks: Yeah I really think they should be an add-ons 90% of them
[3:58:14] Pradathelord: soul rip
[3:58:16] Symo85: master summoner
[3:58:16] JNE14: why does Blizzard kinda forget about balance changes every time a new expansion is near?
[3:58:17] What_ln_Tarnation: !followage
[3:58:17] gr_faux: shadow rift
[3:58:17] Moobot: @What_ln_Tarnation What_ln_Tarnation has been following Venruki for 6y 5mo
[3:58:24] Pradathelord: master summoner too yea
[3:58:30] Cephqt: why not master summoner?
[3:58:38] numero5218: burning rush
[3:58:48] leeka: unplayable without master summoner
[4:01:46] tomzartheravenlord: This is painful to watch
[4:02:24] style5z: KI-KI-KI-KI-KI-KI-KILL
[4:02:53] Hamrock77: Is this a random?
[4:03:29] shogun2022: yes
[4:03:29] leeka: its hard yeah
[4:03:30] ripzaddo: YEP
[4:03:34] heymomimonttv: destro would win
[4:03:38] smitesucks: war counters everything demo does
[4:03:39] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:03:40] heymomimonttv: i think demo is kinda poopy rn
[4:03:48] FateIRL: you didnt use your felguard grimoire
[4:03:51] FateIRL: that game
[4:04:00] Blitzylive: ez dh
[4:04:12] sourbutts: destro definitely better
[4:04:19] style5z: demo'
[4:04:22] style5z: is good dude
[4:04:25] kaanilami: little dark age fan :O
[4:04:27] style5z: RUL GUD
[4:04:31] davErosEe: this is easier than war/sham
[4:04:41] heymomimonttv: i think demo is the weakest of the 3 lock specs
[4:04:45] JNE14: @venruki what caster classes gave you enjoyes the most in s3 ?
[4:05:02] Kolowavex: wanna q some retribuki with paradiseone and I?
[4:05:10] Hamrock77: HAHAHAHAHA
[4:05:15] sotirios2000: lol
[4:05:25] shogun2022: LOL
[4:05:30] gr_faux: smooth brain dh
[4:05:39] davErosEe: yeah could‚Äôve prevented that
[4:05:47] heymomimonttv: dh is drooling on himself rn
[4:05:53] donnule: welcome to the life of the warlocks
[4:06:06] khrylx_: @donnule poor s tier class
[4:06:18] flyingorangee: waiting for dh nerf COPIUM
[4:06:42] gr_faux: if you can‚Äôt beat em fuck em
[4:06:57] shogun2022: are there new patch notes coming out tonight?
[4:07:05] srslysnek: meanwhile your healer is like YEAH THIS IS GREAT
[4:07:07] shogun2022: err hotfix
[4:07:16] Yanari_x: fun Pepega
[4:07:39] heymomimonttv: this song is a vibe
[4:08:05] srslysnek: a DH won.. my god, who could have seem this coming
[4:08:07] Hobblefoot: Oh Bumble, you silly little priest.
[4:08:09] Blitzylive: do you not have gear? how is DH double your dmg?
[4:08:11] yesterday_potato: Where them mmr injections. If they dont come soon ima have to switch to trt injections
[4:08:15] kaanilami: is this unbalance or just outskilled?
[4:08:20] TrippThree: Time for 3's!!!
[4:08:21] kaanilami: because it looked unfair
[4:08:22] Kolowavex: msgd u in game buddy
[4:08:23] Yaycarrots: PrideFloat no
[4:08:27] heymomimonttv: ah priest is from azralon, explains a lil more
[4:08:31] Hobblefoot: That might have been a skill issue that game.
[4:08:39] numero5218: dh is cleaving
[4:08:40] leeka: @kaanilami dh and war are tough for demo in 2s
[4:08:42] JNE14: again my same question why hasn't there been some balance fixes
[4:08:42] Kolowavex: whats wrong?
[4:08:48] shogun2022: certain classes just counter other classes and its more noticeable in 2s imo
[4:08:52] Kolowavex: :(
[4:08:54] chubmax: you guys expect balance changes?  LOL
[4:08:57] Kolowavex: ret hunters kinda pog
[4:08:58] chubmax: blizzard is beyond pathetic
[4:09:18] Fragssgaming: too slow?? all my games at 2.2mmr are over within like 2 or 3 minutes cus of how crazy everyones damage is and how much cc every class has
[4:09:19] jontepman: @chubmax get out
[4:09:21] shogun2022: the dampening meta is shit for sure its not like old dampening where we would wither away its like you get to damp and get randomly 1 shot
[4:09:28] srslysnek: 2 outlaw next?
[4:09:43] xhinoc: the moment who dude look at MoP PvP and remember how cool PvP is
[4:09:50] heymomimonttv: you're at the part of the bracket where it's gonna be mainly dh and warr you're up against
[4:09:55] Hobblefoot: Okay Bumble, talk you your Lock. If they can free cast, they can fear, so make sure they peel for you buddy.  :P
[4:10:03] shogun2022: the neanderthal bracket
[4:10:17] Hobblefoot: Hahaha you caught that.  I was just messing with you @venruki
[4:10:19] kyaii: oh wow look another dh healer
[4:10:36] shogun2022: its almost like theres a dh in every lobby
[4:10:43] chubmax: dh is fun and OP
[4:10:44] srslysnek: sometimes i trinket before cc on my DH, just to psych em out
[4:10:49] sotirios2000: you can't win with your demons, he is a demon hunter Kappa
[4:10:49] sourbutts: strange comp, you ever played vs this one before?
[4:10:52] chubmax: playing a caster is punishemtn
[4:12:17] Hobblefoot: I have to say there is never going to be a time (the season) where a Lock/Destro will be a favorite to beat DH/Priest if all things are even.  You will need a pretty fair skill edge or hope they make a mistake.  OR ... Take it to deep 2s dampening and they they are done.
[4:12:27] evanluan: LUL
[4:12:28] srslysnek: wow, buff DH
[4:12:33] chubmax: DH needs buffs
[4:12:33] TheNutcracka: i love the demon voice
[4:12:38] wesleypipes21: now their saying how demo is broken
[4:12:58] wesleypipes21: lol
[4:13:04] srslysnek: demo beat DH? believe it or not, JAIL
[4:13:12] SwiisH_Tv: pause
[4:13:23] gr_faux: clip it
[4:13:25] gr_faux: lol
[4:13:32] shogun2022: you thteal eh thweater
[4:13:34] numero5218: tongue action going crazy
[4:13:40] TheNutcracka: @srslysnek  LUL
[4:13:40] Badasti: pep talk from mr bolts
[4:13:41] Pradathelord: @Roxxybolts insane comm there
[4:13:45] Hobblefoot: Demo is broken if you consider the visual over-stimulation of all the pets on the screen a factor.  That is always stressful for my brain.  Haha
[4:13:45] psychic241: sounds like a wow loading screen; the best way to win is by not losing
[4:13:50] empewress: lol
[4:13:55] dismantlle: do you play destro?
[4:14:02] panasiuk97: I've played over 200 hours of warlock and feel like you play it better than me
[4:14:26] panasiuk97: pvp 5head
[4:14:36] gr_faux: only 200 kek
[4:14:50] Roxxybolts: yeah those are rookie numbers @panasiuk97
[4:14:56] twinbladeuk: i got 3 years played time on my ret PepeLaugh
[4:15:07] Roxxybolts: I played 2000 hrs and I think he's better than me NotLikeThis
[4:15:10] smoochins: @twinbladeuk that means you're really good right
[4:15:28] twinbladeuk: @smoochins im the best in my house EZ
[4:15:31] TheNutcracka: i play since release and he is better than me
[4:15:35] david_v_goldberg: @twinbladeuk still learning ?
[4:15:42] srslysnek: @twinbladeuk thank you for making me feel good about my play time GlitchCat
[4:16:00] Pradathelord: is he dodging it with that one talent
[4:16:07] Pradathelord: must be
[4:16:20] nikthevoker: they all do
[4:16:22] Zeniticon: maybe the ward from holy priest
[4:16:24] LordRatigan: Thats actually next level
[4:16:27] Myth_The_Wolf: Can your stun be parried?
[4:16:29] gr_faux: I had 5 years played on my shaman back in mop kek never checked it again
[4:16:32] Pradathelord: randomly dodging is *cool*
[4:16:33] skwiglz: i was wondering about that dodge talent
[4:16:35] Hobblefoot: I have played 9853 Arena matches on my Outlaw and I bet Ven could beat my best rating in less than 2 weeks.
[4:16:38] nameyourform: big brain
[4:16:45] Zeniticon: holy priest has a ward which immunes cc
[4:16:59] nikthevoker: @venruki they all do that for hunters too
[4:17:03] Fragssgaming: how come you just said 3s is so slow atm? lol
[4:17:06] davErosEe: ww zug
[4:17:10] Myth_The_Wolf: You can dodge the axe but not parry it?
[4:17:27] Fragssgaming: why are my games over within 2 / 3 games cus every game is zugzug... 2.3 mmr
[4:17:41] R1_Prototype: no weapon. no parry.
[4:17:52] ButtaTWD: ven is speaking facts
[4:18:01] TumbleShaman: Yeah, watching awc games last 13 mins was not fun
[4:18:01] LordRatigan: Yes
[4:18:02] Cvarks: 3s are so ass
[4:18:11] leeka: fel synergy sucks
[4:18:12] Pradathelord: did your pet die or something
[4:18:31] hooqs: LMAO
[4:18:32] shogun2022: 3s is pretty annoying atm, feels like you get cheesed more often than getting outskilled
[4:18:34] Pradathelord: ratio'd
[4:18:34] leeka: its good for pet healing vs dot classes. but does almost nothing for the warlock
[4:18:42] style5z: we no play no more/
[4:18:59] Hobblefoot: Do all of you think your feelings on 3s is skewed?  Maybe it has always been this way but now that you have Solo, your brains register 3s as more boring?
[4:19:00] david_v_goldberg: he find dh
[4:19:08] Yanari_x: mean healer Sadge
[4:19:11] jontepman: love it when you play demo
[4:19:15] style5z: as a healer 3s is fun after being in shuffle ass
[4:19:16] xhinoc: bcs this I prefer shuffle
[4:19:30] Hobblefoot: @venruki Sometimes you just throw shit out there to see if it sticks. Haha.
[4:19:31] greatshampoo: telling you how to play when he doesn‚Äôt use a pain suppression during dh big boorst, love to see it
[4:20:25] FelQueen: priest just needs a little more skill
[4:20:26] style5z: people don't always play profane
[4:20:26] leeka: soul conduit
[4:21:14] leeka: he doesnt have fast pet summon
[4:21:31] leeka: very rare people kill felguard
[4:22:02] ripzaddo: kill his pet NOTED
[4:22:03] sourbutts: whats worse the retpocolypse or the current invasion of the Burning Legion Bounty Hunters
[4:22:18] style5z: the retpocalypse was way worse man

[4:48:34] gdodmebxu: @jxygodx sub gets nerfed because you can't fotm reroll it Kappa
[4:48:58] strafekey: I wouldn‚Äôt even call it a Major Weakness. they are pretty insane right now
[4:49:01] gdodmebxu: dh is completely broken. saying they die to rogues is hilarious
[4:49:01] kusoneko: absolute pump

[4:49:09] KralHor: Every lobby in 2v2 above 1900 MMR has DH

[4:51:51] strafekey: there is always something that is broken but blizz just lets it ride way too long
[4:51:52] jxygodx: can't even play 3s atm its just lock/x

[5:23:33] grimmjowhd: im new to pvp and thats one of the only weakauras im using lol
[5:23:40] zachgamegodx: I see it  on my raid frames
[5:23:45] twinbladeuk: what a chilled banger
[5:23:48] Puffeynick: do Weak Auras need to be re downloaded when there is an update? or does it auto import it?
[5:23:50] mfushi: what aura ?
[5:24:06] TheBiggestManOnCampus: is this a random youtube playlist?
[5:24:07] Cerion17: that is so lame
[5:24:09] nz_jade: who is right, NA with Rogue or EU with DH
[5:24:17] Badasti: its so stupid, i kinda hate that they posted it but i get it... im still trying to play without it
[5:24:19] affablebeef: If they remove weakaura im fine  with it, but i would like more UI customizations. i like some that have a better visual for a proc then just a buff
[5:24:25] orcrimmar: Don't need that weakaura if i'm always the healer haha
[5:24:31] thasthebear: except the people on my team when im healing ss... they def dont use
[5:24:35] R1_Prototype: I really only use weak aura to give myself indicators for my own mechanics on procs. that the game doesn‚Äôt already.
[5:24:36] Myth_The_Wolf: Holy shit
[5:24:38] Kymagez: no addons macros wa's im struggling to hit 1600
[5:24:41] Badasti: would be so much easier for an icon to beam itself into my eyeballs rather than watch the game and check arena frames
[5:24:52] zachgamegodx: if the games so automated why the hell do healers not dispel roots on my burst
[5:24:58] Myth_The_Wolf: @Kymagez What class do you play?
[5:25:07] Kymagez: dont ask lol
[5:25:12] Myth_The_Wolf: SMH my head
[5:25:34] Kymagez: easiest class to play with nothing
[5:25:37] Myth_The_Wolf: DH?
[5:25:37] Kymagez: :)
[5:25:40] Kymagez: yup
[5:25:56] Myth_The_Wolf: Then it might be awareness/positioning/CC chains
[5:26:01] Myth_The_Wolf: Though it's hard to do it shuffle tbf
[5:26:30] Kymagez: awareness def, used to mes honking at me to tell me whats going on
[5:27:02] Myth_The_Wolf: Do you always put the enemy healer in your focus?
[5:27:03] Badasti: honestly I think all addons except for quality of life stuff like Bartender, combat text, details and damage meters etc should be removed. No addon should give you a direct advantage over not using an addon
[5:27:12] LordRatigan: Kapp
[5:27:15] Kymagez: me? yup
[5:27:18] Myth_The_Wolf: Ok good
[5:27:20] Cephqt: learned to press 1-2-1-2-3 instead of 1-2-1-2??
[5:27:38] Myth_The_Wolf: Without seeing your matches I'd have to guess what you're doing
[5:27:44] CrazyJoeDavola57: happy Friday ven
[5:27:46] light_of_heart: your transmog game is also quite strong
[5:28:04] Myth_The_Wolf: But one thing that I love about my 2v2 friend is that he's often very aware of when the enemy healer has me CCed or is CCed and he tries to line up his burst with that sort of stuff
[5:28:07] Badasti: this character creeps me out more than booshka's candle on the head mog
[5:28:10] Myth_The_Wolf: Well, burst and defensives
[5:28:14] CrazyJoeDavola57: hope you been having a great day , got off work early today , super nice out
[5:28:27] Kymagez: just trying to get better at noticing whats going rather than having a WA honking/flashing
[5:28:35] Myth_The_Wolf: Yeah, that takes a while
[5:28:46] Dudewuut: venruki can you show the inital tweet you are discussing
[5:28:48] Myth_The_Wolf: OH, big advice is DON'T LISTEN TO MUSIC while playing if you're not using addons
[5:28:53] TheBiggestManOnCampus: whats the difference between szchewan and chinese food
[5:29:03] Myth_The_Wolf: There's a lot of audio cues going on that may let you notice something like a vendetta going off
[5:29:21] Kymagez: good tip ty
[5:29:26] CrazyJoeDavola57: what kind of restaurant ?
[5:29:33] Badasti: UFC fighters using addons too?
[5:29:45] jason7314: almost every 3s match I did yesterday was vs a dh
[5:29:46] Badasti: ah
[5:29:49] Myth_The_Wolf: Listening to the spell effects can help a lot in the game, but it's also one of those things that takes a while to learn
[5:29:52] CrazyJoeDavola57: well I‚Äôm celiac so I can only go to Singapore sams haha
[5:29:54] Kymagez: true
[5:29:58] Badasti: back when everything still thought Kung Fu and Karate was good
[5:30:12] CrazyJoeDavola57: it‚Äôs ok
[5:30:15] Kymagez: then kimbo slice
[5:30:17] Hamrock77: I feel like Football and Boxing being at the unbelievable level it is, is very enjoyable to watch. Especially when you understand the defensive elements that go around it
[5:30:22] Cephqt: its like the NBA... now you have centers that are 3 point snipers
[5:30:32] fatlittlepaypig: i struggle so hard to hold 2.2k on hpal and then get 2100 on disc priest in full greens i dont get it man
[5:30:34] CrazyJoeDavola57: I bet you can get better food since you‚Äôre not celiac
[5:30:47] moremantella255: nah
[5:30:48] Myth_The_Wolf: Hell yeah
[5:30:53] Cephqt: fuck, I love rice
[5:30:54] moremantella255: wheres the dino chicken nuggies
[5:30:55] wabaflaba: id eat it
[5:30:57] BeakrTTV: looks pgood
[5:30:58] Badasti: @Kymagez i used to watch his street fights on youtube before he joined the UFC LUL
[5:31:02] CrazyJoeDavola57: ya it‚Äôs was pretty good@
[5:31:07] sneakynaki: Looks like actual pictures instead of stuff from google image, gotta respect that
[5:31:10] Kymagez: @Badasti dude same!
[5:31:27] Badasti: bro was a tank
[5:31:34] Kymagez: absolute beast
[5:31:52] sotirios2000: addosn should be banned in UFC
[5:32:12] Kymagez: and WA's
[5:32:56] Badasti: see UFC fighters getting in the ring with apple VR headsets. Icon's lighting up like Christmas tree's telling them when to dodge, where to swing etc
[5:33:21] Pherix1: when i play my rogue it doesnt look like that
[5:33:21] cruelhabbitts: that was so silly lol
[5:33:24] Spaceberry_McDuck: i miss the days of glass cannons
[5:33:24] Pherix1: i should take some notes
[5:33:31] gdodmebxu: yeah the cdr mechs shouldn't apply to defensives
[5:33:38] davErosEe: the real king class
[5:33:47] Zrinn13: pherixr does 25k dps
[5:33:53] Diriculous: i think that's a good example of why outllaw/rdruid is the strongest 2s comp
[5:33:55] Pherix1: :(
[5:34:06] Zrinn13: he also does 25k dps in mythic plus
[5:34:07] killepi: I‚Äôve been saying it this whole xpac rogues literally have everything
[5:34:07] Moobot: Latest video "UPDATED 10.2.5 PvP Tier List! EVERY SPEC RANKED!" view it here: youtu.be/E2wCZf3wKiM
[5:34:10] Pherix1: i dont understand how outlaw works i think you have to have a certain mindset for it
[5:34:28] Kymagez: same as with dh
[5:34:30] davErosEe: rogue teams gatekeep dh teams in 2s
[5:34:34] Kymagez: big brain stuffs
[5:34:35] WardenDOTA: wonked out on adderall and under 18 years old mindset
[5:35:37] Badasti: cute, they are prolonging the inevitable
[5:35:49] Badasti: i like it when they struggle
[5:36:16] Kymagez: monkaS
[5:36:48] CrazyJoeDavola57: you ever been to the globefish in Kensington ?
[5:36:49] Badasti: that warrior did some good dam
[5:36:54] Badasti: was a close game
[5:36:55] Pradathelord: the button itself is crazy
[5:37:00] affablebeef: i have a fix for it, more stam
[5:37:05] Pradathelord: @affablebeef TRUE
[5:37:15] Zeniticon: with blade dance ?
[5:37:21] Yanari_x: there's so many fistweavers
[5:37:38] TheNutcracka: what is blade fury?
[5:37:38] Kymagez: @Zeniticon it buffs blade dance
[5:37:55] CrazyJoeDavola57: it was really good a lot better thank globefish at chinook
[5:38:04] CrazyJoeDavola57: than *
[5:38:08] davErosEe: 80% more death sweep damage or something,  if they nerfed essence break dh would be fine imo
[5:38:27] CrazyJoeDavola57: wohoo
[5:39:06] CrazyJoeDavola57: oh really
[5:39:09] Kymagez: that looks nice
[5:39:10] CrazyJoeDavola57: I‚Äôll tell my wife
[5:39:19] Pradathelord: do it
[5:39:29] numero5218: hon Jin is a Kai ya
[5:39:39] ramenxo: ya essence break nerf is all dh needs to be balanced 100% great take
[5:40:06] davErosEe: it actually is if you understood the game
[5:40:15] ramenxo: ur alone in that camp brother
[5:40:17] Pradathelord: @ramenxo yeah, do not tell them about how much dmg soulscar does with no button press
[5:40:23] davErosEe: LOL sure
[5:40:36] ramenxo: literally scalding take
[5:40:43] davErosEe: we need rating badges damn
[5:41:01] davErosEe: I need to know what I‚Äôm taking to
[5:41:04] numero5218: we need a new pvp game
[5:41:12] bsg_wiz: Whats ur take on this common idea going around the DH need a damage nerf do u feel their lack of other things make it fair?
[5:41:13] Cerion17: AlienDance
[5:41:24] ramenxo: no we need some common sense in the chat room, saying dh needs only an essence break nerf to be balanced is actually the most wild thing ive heard in awhile
[5:41:24] Pradathelord: who even cares let it do dmg
[5:41:27] bsg_wiz: @numero5218 I disagree, people play chess all their lives. same idea
[5:41:33] BobbyJ135: 1 min wall, 5 sec aoe stun
[5:41:35] BobbyJ135: lack of what
[5:41:36] BobbyJ135: lol
[5:41:39] davErosEe: @ramenxo what rating are you
[5:41:39] Pradathelord: these ego'd out dh dudes are getting offended
[5:41:41] davErosEe: LOL
[5:41:43] numero5218: but chess is balanced dummy
[5:41:47] Pradathelord: do NOT talk about dh balance
[5:41:59] Smexxin: what would you say dh lacks in other areas? @bsg_wiz
[5:42:00] bsg_wiz: @ramenxo I'm asking honestly for Ven's take to clarify im not saying they r balanced or need only a light nerf
[5:42:10] Kymagez: @Smexxin i die in stuns
[5:42:12] bsg_wiz: @Smexxin I dont play them but i feel their cc isnt that great no?
[5:42:24] bsg_wiz: Im honestly asking
[5:42:27] bsg_wiz: im not telling.
[5:42:28] gdodmebxu: they have tons of instant cc
[5:42:47] numero5218: cc is god mode on all levels except dying in stuns
[5:42:48] bsg_wiz: do they? i feel like maybe i just dont see good DHs against me
[5:42:49] Pradathelord: while mans has blue bar
[5:42:51] Pradathelord: no it doesnt matter
[5:42:59] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[5:43:00] Pradathelord: aha got em
[5:43:04] Pradathelord: the low para
[5:43:05] Yaycarrots: monkaLaugh
[5:43:05] Smexxin: interesting, i feel like theyre on the stronger side for effective cc's @bsg_wiz
[5:43:08] bsg_wiz: is DH just like a better fury?
[5:43:09] kyaii: ruki1D
[5:43:13] Pradathelord: @Smexxin agree
[5:43:19] bsg_wiz: @Smexxin I could just be wrong, tbh i dont know and thats why i ask
[5:43:21] Badasti: @bsg_wiz dh is like a better everything
[5:43:26] bsg_wiz: interesting
[5:43:27] CrazyJoeDavola57: have a good stream ven , gotta head out , hopefully you can get some sunlight before you‚Äôre done it‚Äôs super nice out !
[5:43:27] numero5218: guys trolling
[5:43:29] gdodmebxu: isn't chaos nova on isolated target the longest stun in the game
[5:43:39] Waptap: Waptap subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! I agree DHs are the new Rets. Hunters should be next
[5:43:40] Cerion17: dh is just S tier fury warrior KEKW
[5:43:58] bsg_wiz: DH how bad do they need a nerf
[5:43:59] bsg_wiz: and why
[5:44:04] honsou2: @bsg_wiz "I dont play them" things that no one believe LUL
[5:44:07] bsg_wiz: basically is it fair bc they lack in other areas besides dam
[5:44:10] bsg_wiz: or is it really unfair
[5:44:11] Waptap: got u always bby
[5:44:19] ramenxo: the proposed solution to the dh problem is a slight nerf to essence break by our resident ape
[5:44:19] bsg_wiz: I see, hardest dam spec?
[5:44:29] numero5218: they are op. there‚Äôs ur answer
[5:44:35] Waptap: DHs have as much CC as rogues lol
[5:44:37] Pradathelord: they claim they die and they claim that they dont have CC
[5:44:39] bsg_wiz: I'm asking like, light nerf or hard hard nerf?
[5:44:41] Pradathelord: but they have every DR
[5:44:42] Cocoapuffs1: dh only has 3 separate drs
[5:44:43] bsg_wiz: Ok i see
[5:44:45] Kymagez: insane self healing is eh
[5:44:47] honsou2: and they can even dps through their fear now LUL
[5:44:58] Waptap: DHs need to die easier, everything else is fine
[5:44:59] ramenxo: whats a class that doesnt die in stun? like lock maybe
[5:45:01] Tacticq: @Cocoapuffs1 LUL
[5:45:03] Badasti: their cc is also unstoppable, just instant
[5:45:06] Pradathelord: @ramenxo prolly
[5:45:11] Pradathelord: they can die in a stun if they try hard enough
[5:45:11] e10100111001: i just think they need to do less damage, but blizzard will prob gut
[5:45:17] numero5218: delete class imo
[5:45:20] Innerverse: dh go burrrr BIG DAM
[5:45:20] honsou2: @joey10100111001 blizzard will just leave them alone
[5:45:24] wompstoleyourlotus: it trips me out how sometimes the "OP classes" aren't played much in AWC
[5:45:25] bsg_wiz: I agree that there is too easy a way to deal damage on DH if that makes sense too much free dam
[5:45:25] gdodmebxu: they should rework frost tier Pog
[5:45:27] ramenxo: blur 2 minute cd and bug fixed to be able to be hit from behind, tier nerfed, and honestly maybe a hot take... remove ms from dh
[5:45:28] Cocoapuffs1: @tacticq <3
[5:45:38] Secretwombatbro: tier turns VT into damnation for sp
[5:45:40] Pradathelord: and thjose buttosn put up a bleed
[5:45:43] Pradathelord: seems fine
[5:45:47] bsg_wiz: not literally free
[5:45:50] bsg_wiz: but basically free dam
[5:45:54] ramenxo: make death sweep not do 405 things in 1 button somehow lol
[5:46:01] bsg_wiz: LOL
[5:46:04] SlyMooseMan: Is that the tier that's winning in the poll for next season?
[5:46:09] Pradathelord: @ramenxo i think that ship has sailed or this expansion
[5:46:18] bsg_wiz: dang
[5:46:20] bsg_wiz: ooooooof
[5:46:24] bsg_wiz: thats pve dam
[5:46:25] xclammation: nice! A retail andy like me!
[5:46:25] Phycerog: yeah but thats not in pvp, thats pve
[5:46:29] bsg_wiz: jeezus
[5:46:37] bsg_wiz: pve gear right?
[5:46:39] ramenxo: death sweep is literally aoe, single target, a dot, ms, procs tier for 2 seperate debuffs, a slow and bleed.
[5:46:39] Pradathelord: if it were pvp dmg the number would go up
[5:46:40] gdodmebxu: @Phycerog you never cleave in pvp?
[5:46:43] ramenxo: what other button does that much shit
[5:46:45] Smexxin: easy to pull off/effective dmg, instant cc, strong passive survivability is just too strong of a combo. somethings gotta give
[5:46:46] kusoneko: if you pressed eye beam that'd be the full rotation Kappa
[5:46:49] Innerverse: tru thats without pvp ilvl scaled up
[5:46:54] Phycerog: @gdodmebxu the training dummy is a pve dummy
[5:46:55] bsg_wiz: thats disgusting LOL
[5:47:06] bsg_wiz: so it jsut keeps going up....?
[5:47:08] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu yeah that makes his point even clearer though
[5:47:12] Mydragon: and this is without activating the pvp stats
[5:47:15] Secretwombatbro: are your pvp stats even active
[5:47:22] Badasti: nope
[5:47:24] FreddoB: i dont get why we have tier in pvp‚Ä¶
[5:47:25] ramenxo: they arent, he has 629k hp
[5:47:31] bsg_wiz: damn
[5:47:40] bsg_wiz: this is nutty and im learnin a lot
[5:47:44] Pradathelord: it's weird for sure
[5:48:01] bsg_wiz: i just beat a few DH in 2s but it was very low CR like i had tanked to farm conquest ad was just getting back to challenger 2-3 ish
[5:48:04] Pradathelord: im just gonna log on mine and blast on it and not wonder why it is the way it is
[5:48:06] zachgamegodx: ok ven
[5:48:10] Pradathelord: s1 ret paladin effect
[5:48:11] Yimbus737: !addons

[5:48:26] plutasium: as a DH i approve :)
[5:48:27] Roxxybolts: stream not to mention his god healer he's playing with
[5:48:30] Roxxybolts: Kappa
[5:48:33] Mydragon: they are the highest skill buttons though
[5:48:40] bsg_wiz: btw in ad but not a complaint just fyi
[5:48:41] Pradathelord: hes not even accounting for this insane healer's monk debuff
[5:48:45] Koraszdormu: Eh, healer is a little hit or miss...  Kappa
[5:48:45] Pradathelord: crazy
[5:48:46] bsg_wiz: damn
[5:48:48] vmills: the zug is strong in this one
[5:48:50] Badasti: @Roxxybolts is that mr bolts healing?
[5:48:55] zachgamegodx: its funny that u didnt even the most op part about dh
[5:48:59] bsg_wiz: MW so good dude i love to play with a MW pvp
[5:49:05] SlyMooseMan: When did you start listening to tame impala?
[5:49:07] fatlittlepaypig: you cant fade dispel UA anymore right?
[5:49:12] Pradathelord: correct
[5:49:12] gdodmebxu: @fatlittlepaypig no
[5:49:12] bsg_wiz: @zachgamegodx he even said, he pressed like 3 buttons including auto lol
[5:49:13] Roxxybolts: yeah yeah @Badasti
[5:49:14] zachgamegodx: demonic apetite makes it so every chaos strike has a 20% chance to spawn a thing that heals them for 20% of their hp
[5:49:17] fatlittlepaypig: @fatlittlepaypig ty
[5:49:19] zachgamegodx: its a baseline passive
[5:49:20] Mydragon: aoe dmg, aoe cc, micro cc, mobility, it feels too much to me tbh
[5:49:30] n3v3rlukky: blizzard have to realize pvp and pve are two separate things and balance them accordingly
[5:49:37] fatlittlepaypig: the girls gone wild commercials on mtv as a kid ü§§
[5:49:43] ryanblue98: RIP mtv music videos
[5:49:43] Badasti: @Roxxybolts i thought that healer must be some kind of legend
[5:49:49] logikol: !armory

[5:49:59] SlyMooseMan: great group to see live
[5:50:15] Badasti: send his ass down to frown town
[5:50:30] bsg_wiz: World of Warcraft is a zombie, everyone calls it dead but it keeps on truckin
[5:50:55] ihavesmokedcrack: Only classic andys and sod players say games dead! because its boring asf
[5:51:00] Pradathelord: this is a banger
[5:51:08] honsou2: @bsg_wiz when they say game is dead they dont mean its literally closed, they just mean almost no one plays it anymore
[5:51:08] bsg_wiz: @ihavesmokedcrack on the real...
[5:51:24] bsg_wiz: @honsou2 lol but everyone does
[5:51:25] FreddoB: i wish i could read cyrillic, so much cyrillic servers on out battlegroup or whatever
[5:51:27] gdodmebxu: @bsg_wiz not even true

[5:52:44] ardreyn: i miss seeing hunters in rated pvp
[5:52:50] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[5:52:52] Shakertime: that fear change kinda came out of left field
[5:52:53] bsg_wiz: I see hunters lower MMR
[5:52:55] Pradathelord: totally did dam to these guys and they died
[5:52:57] n3v3rlukky: fear is a stun now
[5:52:57] Pradathelord: eheheheheheh
[5:53:00] honsou2: its cool theyre doing SOD class tuning but not retail. Im sure retail is very popular LUL
[5:53:02] ramenxo: youll see me and mike if u q up 2s around 2300 mmr the only thug players left on NA im p sure

[5:53:43] Shakertime: @honsou2 expend your energy on something positive man
[5:53:43] Koraszdormu: I hate the fear change.
[5:53:49] dakila24: the fear change is so cooked lol, it's another stun for wars right now, they do like 40% to me before it breaks
[5:53:51] zachgamegodx: fear spam from demo and destro is stupid with the new threshold
[5:53:54] zachgamegodx: ill never accept it
[5:53:57] Badasti: Roxxy running an IRL mog?
[5:54:06] ryanblue98: arrest those orcs
[5:54:13] TimmyShoes: just watched your 1v1 with pika. people are beefing in the comments about rogue design, lol
[5:54:26] bsg_wiz: @zachgamegodx it was MUCH worse in actual vanilla. classic is a fixed version of that. fear had NO diminishing returns.
[5:54:29] thaizee: gotta get the robe from the trading post
[5:54:30] honsou2: @Shakertime its positive to understand reality lil buddy
[5:54:34] thaizee: for complete mog
[5:54:46] ramenxo: i wont say rogue does too much healing but i want whatever is in crimson vial irl i need that in my life
[5:54:49] ihavesmokedcrack: 8.6 mil subs and on average 2.13 mil daily log in! Dead game
[5:54:50] TimmyShoes: rogue healing and the fact that they can continually reset and just hide in stealth for dampening.
[5:54:51] zachgamegodx: @bsg_wiz well there was no demonic circle in classic haha, locks actually died
[5:55:06] bsg_wiz: @zachgamegodx I didnt tbh.
[5:55:10] bsg_wiz: soul link, etc
[5:55:11] honsou2: @ihavesmokedcrack yeah classic is very popular
[5:55:11] zachgamegodx: i mean i dont think locks are more op than dh, but the fear thing was a complete jackass change
[5:55:15] TimmyShoes: i think being able to constantly reset and just sit in stealth for dampening is a way bigger concern/flaw than the self-healing
[5:55:28] bsg_wiz: @zachgamegodx I mean not never, but it was not balanced. at all
[5:55:35] TimmyShoes: don't blame any rogue for playing that way BUT it isn't exactly conducive to fun gameplay
[5:55:40] Shakertime: @honsou2 and here you are watching retail ;)
[5:55:51] Axtin: i mean do u think pika should lose to an rsham in a 1v1
[5:55:53] zachgamegodx: fear and root change just makes people MORE frustrated and MORE reliant on someone playing healer well (aka dispelling entanglingroots/fears) using dispels on the right person
[5:56:24] honsou2: @Shakertime And you can go watch the stream numbers for classic vs retail ;)
[5:56:24] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: is there a macro to place sigil at focus? like for the fear sigil?
[5:56:26] gdodmebxu: @zachgamegodx sounds like a melee problem :)
[5:56:32] Secretwombatbro: this song always makes me think of the lizalfos from ocarina of time
[5:56:40] TimmyShoes: @Axtin not necessarily. not even the argument people are making.
[5:56:49] zachgamegodx: @gdodmebxu its a healer problem
[5:56:51] zachgamegodx: they need to dispel
[5:57:13] Shakertime: @honsou2 and yet here you are :)
[5:57:15] thaizee: @zachgamegodx have fun dispelling vs affli lock or sps
[5:57:17] bsg_wiz: @honsou2 today, 1.5M people logged into retail, roughly.
[5:57:33] Shakertime: and its the down season for retail
[5:57:36] thaizee: @bsg_wiz source?
[5:57:37] TimmyShoes: it's just not fun running around a pillar spamming stealth so you can run away and wait 5 minutes for dampening, and it's not fun trying to chase down a rogue to prevent that. it's not fun gameplay on either side of things imo
[5:57:39] honsou2: @bsg_wiz whats your source
[5:57:42] zachgamegodx: @thaizee aff fears break
[5:57:47] bsg_wiz: mmo-population
[5:57:47] zachgamegodx: sps/demos/destros dont
[5:58:12] zachgamegodx: sp backlash should never be a concern, you're lettign your teams damage sink to avoid a 2 second horrify?
[5:58:23] bsg_wiz: all the sites say roughly 1.4-1.5M just today
[5:58:32] Axtin: @TimmyShoes it is dumb but i think the biggest enabler of that gameplay is the eye being way too outdated, needs to be up more frequently and last longer or something
[5:58:33] TrippThree: SPamming on an OP class......... wow.....
[5:58:52] Koraszdormu: He t-posed on you, and asserted his DH dominance.
[5:58:58] amgine04: but at the same time everyone loves seeing a fw die :)
[5:59:13] TimmyShoes: @Axtin that's an idea. i think dampeing should also increase the length of time you're in combat
[5:59:27] humansoup7777: bro got tposed on idk what to say hard to come back from that
[5:59:39] meiscorn: why is mw the best healer for dh
[5:59:41] jfachal: do you not think DH needs nerfs ?
[5:59:47] FreddoB: fistmemer
[5:59:58] zachgamegodx: why would they need nerfs at all?????
[6:00:01] zachgamegodx: they're just average
[6:00:02] Axtin: @TimmyShoes i feel like that would just feel like clunky game design, you dont want combat mechanics to be inconsistent imo
[6:00:03] Captura68: why are u an gay elf?
[6:00:07] ryanblue98: how about we buff the DH 20% dam
[6:00:21] e10100111001: yo @bsg_wiz your data's souce comes from: We measure two primary metrics: Reddit Subscribers and Reddit Active Users.
[6:00:22] ihavesmokedcrack: Femboy venruki
[6:00:23] Captura68: in what world?
[6:00:25] Innerverse: hella swagger
[6:00:36] Secretwombatbro: cause fish sticks
[6:00:43] StromicusRex: have something against gay elves?
[6:00:44] honsou2: @bsg_wiz this is a fake website
[6:00:52] ihavesmokedcrack: Venruki character likes fish sticks
[6:00:58] thaizee: @joey10100111001 it specifically says on the website that their WoW Data is wildly inaccurate
[6:01:03] redskinlgnd: As a retiree man it is good to see the game and community never changes
[6:01:03] TimmyShoes: @Axtin maybe, but the game design is already super clunky. maybe it could kick in only after a certain point of dampening.
[6:01:05] FreddoB: jthe shoulder drapes would look good with that
[6:01:32] TimmyShoes: like at 50% dampening, the time you're in combat starts to slowly increase
[6:01:33] ihavesmokedcrack: honsou go do gnomer 100x times
[6:01:36] TrippThree: Lol no delts in RL...
[6:01:50] FateIRL: lol
[6:01:54] TimmyShoes: that would prevent people from drinking as much as well. though of course it just makes night elves that much more busted with shadowmeld, lol
[6:01:55] fatlittlepaypig: LUL that response
[6:02:03] Kymagez: lol
[6:02:08] Koraszdormu: Roxy getting greedy.
[6:02:18] honsou2: @bsg_wiz yes its based on reddit stats? nobody knows how many daily logins there is in wow
[6:02:23] honsou2: except activision-microsoft
[6:02:31] ramenxo: i donate 8 subs to get u a new mouse roxy and this is what u do
[6:02:56] ihavesmokedcrack: yeah microsoft would buy a dead game for 70 billion dollar! hansou? is SM boring or what! why are you trolling
[6:03:08] redskinlgnd: only a rogue can out op a dh Kappa
[6:03:09] TimmyShoes: i remember when mmo population said a game called crowfall had 100k active population. the game had a community of like 80 players lol.
[6:03:19] honsou2: @ihavesmokedcrack they didnt buy it for wow, you can read that in the public documents
[6:03:35] ramenxo: if cheap shot didnt go thru blur rogues wouldnt be as insane into dh
[6:03:36] TimmyShoes: WoW's population, daily active user, etc
[6:03:41] xGriefxGodx: putrid
[6:03:54] bsg_wiz: so, every single site says its 1.5 M
[6:03:57] Roxxybolts: I am leaving in just a second to go get that mouse btw @ramenxo
[6:04:04] Shakertime: its just so weird to sit in a retail chat and troll about how the game is dead, like what is your goal
[6:04:08] Rabin7: yo is it worth coming back to for pvp xD i played end of 2023 but left after it got dry
[6:04:08] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[6:04:08] Roxxybolts: then I will have more binds than ever on my FW
[6:04:09] redskinlgnd: I too believe the internet Kappa
[6:04:12] bsg_wiz: im not gonna argue if u look up the number its there....
[6:04:12] honsou2: @bsg_wiz and every single site has no information about it
[6:04:12] o_Gecco_o: Servus
[6:04:19] ramenxo: @Roxxybolts what brand
[6:04:28] Roxxybolts: corsair scimitar
[6:04:30] zachgamegodx: wat?
[6:04:30] Innerverse: big things HYPE ?!
[6:04:37] bsg_wiz: @honsou2 honestly, do u play? regions r super populated.
[6:04:43] ramenxo: acceptable
[6:04:48] zolow_dolo: I like big things...
[6:04:56] bsg_wiz: my arenas just now took 2 sec to queue
[6:05:02] bsg_wiz: just for reference.
[6:05:03] honsou2: @Shakertime living in reality is not trolling
[6:05:09] ramenxo: my wife bought the new steelseries aerox 9 or w/e it is the worst thingever id rather use a 1990 mac trackpad
[6:05:15] redskinlgnd: I haven't played in most of dragonflight now I am just here to troll the trolls still like seeing ven play after 14 years
[6:05:16] Shakertime: @honsou2 nobody cares man get lost
[6:05:33] honsou2: @Shakertime mind your business weirdo
[6:07:21] Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑Ìè¨Ìä∏: I know how many daily logins wow has as I am an active investor in Microsoft and my Dad is the former CEO
[6:07:48] e10100111001: nice
[6:08:07] redskinlgnd: oh yeah I rode on bobby's yaht and drank his piss
[6:08:15] Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑Ìè¨Ìä∏: While this information is secret I can tell you that the number of daily logins is still significant enough to generate hundreds of millions of dollars
[6:09:18] Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑Ìè¨Ìä∏: evasion and cloak built in 1
[6:09:38] gracioussatan: still one of the most bonkers decision I've seen blizz make for rogue
[6:10:07] honsou2: PC games make up about 27% of activision-blizzards earnings in the last 4 quarterly reports, wow is not a breadwinner
[6:10:20] Badasti: cya Ven
[6:10:21] Myth_The_Wolf: Goodbye forever
[6:10:22] zachgamegodx: see you tonight
[6:10:29] krome2dadome: pce
