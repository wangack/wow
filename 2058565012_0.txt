[4:53:53] BerkTheLUL: @BerkTheLUL yeah
[4:53:55] Shungite420: @TX_Mandalorian i was referring to the lock life tapping outta combat at the same time tho its petty to not heal a warlock
[4:53:57] cillixing: juggs YEET
[4:53:58] BassNappr: @Aarget it is, im currently stuck GC2 rn
[4:54:07] Meltim: @BerkTheLUL damn it, I'll install :D

[4:54:24] itz_prismo: byeee graycen going to jerk it then sleep

[4:54:45] TX_Mandalorian: @TX_Mandalorian take another bong hit
[4:54:53] BaddestCloud: @tx_mandalorian yeah bro warlocks life tap normally, it’s your job to heal them because they need to life tap more for mana. it’s their rotation, it seems like you’re getting mad at your own ability to heal a warlock and not the warlock itself
[4:55:03] Meltim: Is rocket league played with a gamepad or mk?
[4:55:12] vindelsito: MC is on?
[4:55:13] Shungite420: @TX_Mandalorian damn you pressed bro
[4:55:17] BassNappr: @Meltim can be played both
[4:55:18] TX_Mandalorian: @BaddestCloud its your job to fuck off, learn to sit and drink like the rest of the group
[4:55:21] cillixing: Smoking weed = Regening mana
[4:55:26] Meltim: But one would be better or no?
[4:55:29] cillixing: let that sink in CiGrip
[4:55:30] Aarget: Controller only
[4:55:37] BassNappr: @Meltim controller is dominant in the scene
[4:55:38] Aarget: Mouse and keyboard is some dumb shit lol
[4:55:43] christiangodwarrior97: @BaddestCloud its when they life tap to full mana before a boss thats annoying
[4:55:50] darafps: darafps subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:55:51] vindelsito: TSM works in sod?
[4:55:54] Meltim: Thanks chat. Gonna try rocket league with controller :D
[4:55:57] Aarget: There's like one pro that uses mouse and key
[4:56:00] Meltim: And Graycen

[4:57:14] cillixing: @vindelsito MODSLTG
[4:57:14] BaddestCloud: @tx_mandalorian and you have the option to play holy paladin properly and not cry, if it’s an issue ask them not to life tap in certain situations instead of complaining to a stream chat. it’s annoying to see you bitch and fight others about an issue you’re wrong about.
[4:57:26] BassNappr: @brjnoqo3kd true, my fav game tho
