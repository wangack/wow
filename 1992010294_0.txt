[4:05:57] OhChano: oh nvm
[4:05:59] valianya: Tagging on Warlock is hard.  Haunt is instant cast but has travel time.  Curses are instant cast too but don't seem to tag because no damage or delayed damage.  Auto attack melee is fastest Warlock tag.
[4:06:04] danoh_64: is it set for aggressive?

[4:06:43] Schloshed: gotta macro /petattack into your spells or wand
[4:06:44] Tyrou: you need to have him on agressive
[4:06:45] piggey__: macro wand attack with pet attackk?

[4:06:57] FatTown: It's on defensive
[4:07:01] Ezekyler: he's on assist

[4:07:06] wikes60: Isn't it set to defensiive
[4:07:07] Foldim: Macro pet attack and wand together
[4:07:10] viciousmeh: the mob has to attack you in defensive

[4:07:52] bluetip84: not until you are hit since he is defensive
[4:07:53] Pharaoh_326: defense means he only atacks when you get hit
[4:07:54] FatTown: Nope, assidt wasn't added till like cata

[4:08:49] Dinomight3: @Poponopolis there is no assist in classic
[4:08:49] Laelas_sm: gotta macro pet attack into most spells
[4:08:51] trollinmyimp: it's classic, you have to make a macro
[4:08:51] MpTido: you broken bro you should reload
[4:08:55] SammyK_G: @Towelliee , just macro a petattack into the spell
[4:08:55] salak_daddy: you HAVE to macro /petattack
[4:08:56] Tyrou: yeah you need to set it on agressive (which will make it attack any enemies nearby)

[4:10:01] pruteee: I think in classic you need to ctrl+1 to make the pet attavk first
[4:10:04] Melanthe: honestly i send mine in first before attacking most of the time, otherwise they lose aggro when the mob is half dead
[4:10:06] trollinmyimp: change the cast to whatever spell you want
[4:10:12] closetn00b: did you remember to drain soul hogger for the rune?
