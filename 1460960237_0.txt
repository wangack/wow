[3:19:39] EvoCyberNation: They took away Warlock's OP health and chaos bolt, but gave it back to them.
[3:19:52] EvoCyberNation: You would think blizz would have learnt the first time? Nope
[3:20:16] Lidolis: yeah how ara monks stronger with their fists?

[3:59:05] BoricuaSJ: they will explain
[3:59:20] BoricuaSJ: LISTEN to them. lol it wont be long
[3:59:45] carbonylchlorid: the new class can hold down some skills to get extra effect or damage
[3:59:50] Kyrones: The longer you hold the button, the more damage it will do. Therefore you will not receive 40k out of nowhere without having a chance to react. It'll basically be a cast bar.
[4:00:06] kirbz09: im cautiously hyped for dragonflight lol
[4:00:12] 인터넷포트: press ur button down long for a harder hit is all the mechanic is
[4:00:17] Kyrones: A cast bar you can release when you wish.
[4:00:29] 인터넷포트: yup
[4:00:37] Creedmoir: keep watching
[4:00:40] FinalBossNZ: not hyped. failed on every expa
[4:00:40] 인터넷포트: so it makes u feel more connected cause u hold it down to hit harder
[4:00:44] luchion09: its a charge move like warr move in lost ark
[4:00:52] Kyrones: I'm assuming they will implement that to other classes.
[4:01:00] Easypapi: Yo Swiftyyyy thoughts rn?
[4:01:06] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[4:01:06] BoricuaSJ: what if they make it uninteruptable..
[4:01:14] BoricuaSJ: its not a cast
[4:01:15] kirbz09: this feels like an actual hero class
[4:01:22] 인터넷포트: I personally dont think the dragon class will be good in pvp
[4:01:22] Gizimoo86: just roll it probably op LuL
[4:01:29] Avdolz: oh yeah pala will still do giga damage
[4:01:30] Creedmoir: Only evokers can be dragons right?
[4:01:35] 인터넷포트: its guna be a pve clas
[4:01:45] Avdolz: @Creedmoir yes
[4:01:55] 인터넷포트: the thiing that flies in the air and does damage below like i cant see that being good for pvp
[4:02:00] 인터넷포트: but in pve the aoe will be good
[4:02:03] 97lina: @Creedmoir yes, dragons can only be evokers and evokers can only be dragons
[4:02:04] Creedmoir: What makes you say it will only be a pve class?
[4:02:11] BoricuaSJ: I bet it's wont show as a cast, it will be an "instant" when you release the button.  so as an oponent you wont see a cast bar"
[4:02:21] Creedmoir: WHAT EVOKER LOOKS OP AS HECK FOR PVP
[4:02:23] Avdolz: @인터넷포트 could be used like a re position + damage?
[4:02:35] 인터넷포트: @Creedmoir the 2 spells they showed totally looked like a pve class
[4:02:38] Creedmoir: @Shwayaz  THATS what im saying
[4:02:57] Creedmoir: Again, why couldnt that be utilized as a damage blink in pvp?

[4:15:30] richardabeast: @Creedmoir '23 most likely Q4
[4:15:31] Creedmoir: @Galdrena how the heck retail gonna go on for another year without that lol
[4:15:39] Kyrones: @Creedmoir 2023 100% because if they are going to use Wrath releasing in 2022 as a marketing strat they 100% would have done the same thing from Dragonflight. 2023 Q1 is my guess.
[4:16:06] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[4:16:15] Galdrena: @Creedmoir we're getting a 9.2.5 at some point lol
[4:16:17] Creedmoir: @Kyrones  thats a good prediction
[4:16:35] Galdrena: what months are Q1?
[4:16:53] Creedmoir: new patch? Havent played since MOP myself. Thought graphics sucked and hated the talent tree and most systems
[4:16:56] richardabeast: @Galdrena I thought i heard them say that as well in the revealing of the xpac

[4:17:18] richardabeast: First four months are Q1
[4:17:18] Creedmoir: 4 quarters in a year. 12/4 = 3

[5:38:54] TWINTVT: you're a legend bro!
[5:39:10] HowieLove: Hey Swifty been along time since I watched how are you?
[5:39:23] Hyoox: new wow expansion is like march - may 2023
[5:39:29] KingWrightDev: yeah I'm PSYCHED for wotlk. That's where I started. Did you see Towliee say that he has info he has been sitting on about wotlk+?
[5:40:36] CannabiTy: I bet they'll release Dragonflight during the downtime in Wrath before the Ulduar patch
[5:40:50] Hyoox: wtlk hype will end fast cuz theres not enough boosters to give smourne to x person etc

[5:41:45] Xaviwan078: ops caps
[5:42:09] KingWrightDev: yeah a mixture of all dragonflights? I love the idea about the prismatic spells. It's a mixture of colors as the spell comes out and then it turns into  the dragonflight color
[5:42:09] Xaviwan078: im very happy and hype
[5:42:12] HowieLove: You are Horde now?
[5:42:17] cosmin284: saw they made personal arena rating instead of  are team in Wotk
[5:42:20] JamoJokester: There’s genuine reasons to be optimistic about Dragonflight than most previous, could make WoW more casual player friendly which was like 70% of wow vanilla fanbase
[5:42:22] clickvoodoo: The cinematic made me tear up hahah
[5:42:43] TWINTVT: swifty do u think the new expansion will result in expansion of a new wow player base?
[5:42:52] KingWrightDev: @hardstyleflavour same xD the cinematics are always top tier
[5:43:04] KingWrightDev: hoping they reveal player housing at some point, but that's copium

[5:43:48] KingWrightDev: ooh and no dungeon finder in wotlk. So psyched about that
[5:44:01] cosmin284: What do you think guys of the dungeon finder removal in Wotk ?
[5:44:13] Hyoox: good
[5:44:14] KingWrightDev: I hope dragonflight is difficult. maybe slightly less difficult than cata was at release.
[5:44:16] clickvoodoo: apparently rabked solo shuffle will be a thing thats interesting
[5:44:21] clickvoodoo: ranked*
[5:44:22] Hyoox: all the bad started in wtlk
[5:44:24] KingWrightDev: I love the dungeon finder removal
[5:44:24] Uafreak: I think it was when Ian said this expasnion will make it so players can play WoW how they want to play. They may have eluded to more casual possibly?
[5:44:27] Djinx_o: yay more spam in LFG chat xD
