[0:12:13] Razdruid: ngl that was the best MDI in awhile
[0:12:16] greatangelsanguinius: I think for echo to lose a finals they need a dawgs to get them twice. 2 teams rolling the dice aggressively
[0:12:23] doncheecha: yo thats a bit toxic ngl @t4pekid
[0:12:26] hammanu33: @dorki congrats man! global finals incoming
[0:12:49] LifeofSlayer77: hi
[0:12:51] eversmile413: championship aspirations for final cup?
[0:12:51] mjaber20: to beat echo you have to figure out an 8 minute atal lol
[0:12:54] aimbim: echo rise tech was crazy
[0:13:01] yiannisjk: I was happy when echo beat liquid in RWF but at this point it looks like they're on the verge of dominating the game for the next couple years and it may get a bit boring
[0:13:14] bigboyy79: why is echo winning all the time, do they just practice harder
[0:13:17] Robohobbo: you know what would get your mind off work? playing a spec you've never played before (arcane mage)
[0:13:18] Jakeysnakes13: @doncheecha got sand in your vag?
[0:13:28] AndyLaarkin: @bigboyy79 They're good
[0:13:36] kenearosmd: I think they have some up their sleeves for the globals... 8 min atal incoming 100%

[0:13:41] timmayb166: you think blizz is gonna fix the rise tech?
[0:13:46] iznai: tank diff xdd
[0:13:47] greatangelsanguinius: one thing I like about mdi is players gotta play more 1 class so the best players win not the best god comps like live keys
[0:13:49] healful1: I’m genuinely curious but what does mdi pay out compared to say a apex tournament I see apex legends has tournaments for 1mil
[0:14:09] Gromasaurus: Well done today dorki
[0:14:14] t4pekid: Echo is like Bill Russel with 11 rings and no one even comes close
[0:14:14] nightbreeze93: congratssss can't believe you went live ICANT
[0:14:16] ninja_coder: ninja_coder subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Congratz on the finals. You will need to channel your inner Incarnation SD voodoo to beat Echo in the finals :P
[0:14:23] yoimdave: the pool of people they have to ppick from that play at a world class level probably helps
[0:14:25] DogShitPaladin: They also get a lot of tech sent to them
[0:14:34] DogShitPaladin: They mentioned it for brackenhide totem tech last tgp
[0:14:40] binryong: are you going to do M+ or something else?
[0:14:42] bigboyy79: they are humans for sure, u can beat them
[0:14:45] Myusen: yo why james and max call you guys pussies thats not right RAGEY
[0:14:46] Hausinator81: Choo Chooo RPGGhosto
[0:14:52] Harleybane: biggest question tho, did u have fun
[0:14:54] mjaber20: dorki just come up with tech to do a 9 minute everbloom 24 fort, you win.
[0:14:56] AndyLaarkin: @healful1 30k for each group stage 200k for finals
[0:15:05] zarvul: noone else is gonna pull of the rise tech
[0:15:19] bebincalicious: So, Hopeful did help with the Lepan DDoS CaughtIn4K
[0:15:24] Athrophite: do you think the rise ports should be considered an exploit
[0:15:27] LuciFeariUm: there were two ways to snap for portals and they fixed one of the two
[0:15:28] atticusfinch99: They shouldn't, it doesn't feel like cheese just really clever
[0:15:35] yoimdave: yoimdave subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:15:37] yctnm: the rift mage portals make sense and they're so cool to see used that way
[0:15:47] Cmde: grats on 2nd place dude very nice weekend
[0:15:58] Razdruid: I mean its the plague borers all over again

[0:15:59] ratExterminatorDevie: the full rise tech hasn't even been shown yet
[0:16:02] Athrophite: well Grats on second I was rooting for you
[0:16:03] Razdruid: they will prob fix it after the mdi
[0:16:15] DorkiBurnerAccount: echo’s a bunch of cheaters I got u
[0:16:24] Morayeden: When are we getting UH DK rank 1 key streams
[0:16:27] thargonian: Im just waiting to see it in pugs shyyWhat
[0:16:32] ayyylmar: @DorkiBurnerAccount at least you have the balls to say it
[0:16:37] atticusfinch99: They put these mobs with portals and gave no interesting way to use them, until now

[2:03:17] kj01a: the rp in fall is longer than 9:45 Jebaited
[2:03:24] Docaan: @Naowh nothing against Echo, i mean u guys are the kings without a shred of doubt but it's really entertaining when the unexpected happen compared to the usual of Echo winning
[2:03:27] Banoffeh: Drogoh losing to a pot Sadge
[2:03:30] nezo_pont: I do 9.45 when I take a smoke break xdd

[2:04:58] fleks27: kushs team will just snort redbull and do some crazy shit for sure
[2:04:58] Vods: @Noxara_ BM hunter is pretty wrist friendly too .. high lvl its lots of button pressing, but you can easy perform good on like 5-6
[2:05:03] ravss76: but in globals, you gotta do crazy

[2:06:57] Hopefulx: 11:16 i think
[2:07:13] Arisolo: @dorki your DHT looked very slow compared to legendary
[2:07:24] Hopefulx: we were playing protect the president with lepan
[2:07:25] Hopefulx: it was lit
[2:07:29] IAttackYou: tuh is wrong one too
[2:07:35] sprechwe1se: i know its a bit far away but u planning on playing for tgp
[2:07:36] ravss76: i think dht for everyone looked very unoptimised
[2:07:41] 54714: you guys are invited to the global finals right?
[2:07:48] ravss76: def the weakest dungeon of the cup
[2:07:50] d4_damager_: what would mdi be like if teams had X amount of time to post times for each dungeon, but they couldnt restart the dungeons until they finished the previous to avoid continuous resetting
[2:07:55] ravss76: for everyone
[2:08:10] xxChef: you didn’t die enough so I couldn’t type tank? in the chat
[2:08:26] Razzeu: dinkDonk DE time @dorki
[2:08:43] Arisolo: to win though you’re gonna have to cook a ton more. echo sort of styled on everyone while still hiding tech
[2:09:24] ravss76: it depends on the tech. the rise tech was good, if its more like that then yeah
[2:09:33] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[2:09:35] Hopefulx: rise tech was overcooked
[2:09:40] Arisolo: if the pool contains rise and AD and you’re posting a 10:30 compared to a 9:20…
[2:09:42] mjaber20: is it exhausting playing vengeance at that high of a level, and not being able to play another tabk
[2:09:45] mjaber20: tank
[2:09:47] ravss76: that makes sense too
[2:09:50] smuts99: Dorkii mate can u make a guide for morchie as a Vdh
[2:09:59] Docaan: Rise Tech made people Pog out of their minds in chat LUL
[2:10:04] Docaan: it was awesome highlight
[2:10:05] oneygaming: i usually love mad strats, but the rise tech made viewing less interesting
[2:10:09] schizniget: Dorki farm the two events before the superbloom for your rares
[2:10:19] schizniget: you can get 3 - 5 rares per event
[2:10:23] Ruinx81: Yo bro MDI was sick great job
[2:10:24] 16attempts: whats your favorite tank?
[2:10:31] Docaan: So far MDI is 10/10

[2:10:41] Hopefulx: dude it is so lit as a dps tank just stops everything
[2:10:41] ravss76: its alot of personal respons. for sure
[2:10:46] TheGame402: after you play vengance every other thank except paladin feels like you got 0 control over interrupts and CC
[2:11:01] Hopefulx: i do like one db at the end of packs and thats it
[2:11:06] manlyhandles: PAYPHONE
[2:11:16] ravss76: warrior kinda has cc but its budget pally which is budget dh
[2:11:16] aarodis: pally have moore tools of demonhunter

[2:11:49] manlyhandles: 5 dps
[2:11:51] manlyhandles: just blast
[2:11:59] Archmage_Michael: they should raise the key levels by 2 in the finals

[2:12:16] DutchGameLab: fat chicken
[2:12:18] ravss76: im kinda sad we havent seen much uhdk in mdi, was honestly expecting more of them
[2:12:19] kj01a: what goes into pulling together giant pulls like in the mdi anyway?
[2:12:27] danaxvx: one 28 or something
[2:12:29] nezo_pont: Furry at heart
[2:12:31] lexxii44: fat chicken man

[2:13:04] 54714: @dorki disenchant!!!
[2:13:08] GrimFandango: its target capped being a deal breaker right?

[2:13:54] Aandromega: It is weird
[2:14:08] t4pekid: feels like were free again
[2:14:10] Aandromega: Seems like it would be op
[2:14:16] Archmage_Michael: They nerfed Havoc and Aug too much imo. I was really hoping to see havoc
[2:14:17] kj01a: I agree, they should buff aug!
[2:14:22] Athrophite: FIRE COCK
[2:14:23] aarodis: andy do 31 with pally easy
[2:14:30] manlyhandles: yea
[2:14:35] Jumanjiqt: I just really wish UH DK was meta. Favourite class by far but it can be a struggle to get into pug keys
[2:14:54] ravss76: lock just enables so many skips in these old dungeons, if destro didnt make the cut one of the specs would have
[2:14:58] N1xern: havoc is still giga fine though
[2:14:58] Ruinx81: Did you watch the match live where Dawgs beat Echo?
[2:15:22] manlyhandles: smacked was blastin on spriest
[2:15:25] zymmac: imagine if you could’ve been doing all those big pulls with prenerf fel barrage on havoc smoge
[2:15:44] goop: smacked gapping every priest in this tourney
[2:15:44] step014: Did you guys know about portal tech in Rise?
[2:15:46] ravss76: it was an awesome set by dawgs but i think it was more echo playing unpracticed strats as to not reveal things
[2:15:48] goop: makes up for me being the worst lock
[2:15:49] Ruinx81: BDK secret weapon in finals?
[2:15:50] aarodis: echo complete team and good team
[2:15:51] abeldank: crypticz kinda gapped other locks and smacked gapped every spriest
[2:16:09] Arisolo: were you hurt by drogoh having to learn rdruid so last minute
[2:16:09] schizniget: Farm the 2 events you can get 3 - 5
[2:16:11] MightyGIGACHAD: @abeldank sjele hard happed everyone
[2:16:12] aenoswe: Yeah 50 but you get like 8-12 on a frenzy
[2:16:13] schizniget: rares per
[2:16:13] Aandromega: Spriest must be such a vibe
[2:16:13] lobster_heal: Built diff?
[2:16:14] flinked: remember to use your 5min item on the other quest
[2:16:14] aarodis: method na last team to beat echo in mdi
[2:16:24] goop: @abeldank Hmm
[2:16:24] Pallyex53: the last mob during a superbloom counts as a rare too
[2:16:30] Archmage_Michael: will you use the portal tech ?
[2:16:40] Lowon: Echo 4 dps team seemed to be doing a kinda low dps sometimes. I don't really know why.
[2:16:55] fleks27: to figure out if you actually gaped someone you would need to check logs for a decent amount
[2:17:06] Ill00: @Lowon cause they also have to survive shit which cost alot of dps?
[2:17:07] abeldank: gaping someone gachiBASS

[2:17:48] abeldank: @goop TrollAware
[2:18:04] Toadcop: what do you think is wrong with wow competitive what the same players are like 5+ years on the top. it's unreal in any healthy e-sport
[2:18:26] Lowon: Well, Lepans memes all the time, right?
[2:18:30] d1_____________: gz with top 2 @dorki
[2:18:32] Hopefulx: he started lagging as soon as dht started and stopped when brh ended
[2:18:35] Hopefulx: probably just unlucky
[2:18:35] Toadcop: yes makes sense
[2:18:38] Voidtzu: you are still the best Dorki

[2:19:43] Milano___: Sounds like you'd enjoy classic
[2:19:44] Brxdix: wow ist just not a good e sport title. I like watching you in MDI, but its an mmo and not an e sport balanced game
[2:19:46] Ill00: if blizz do like 1m per tournament maybe some good player would invest more in wow....but...

[2:20:36] aarodis: war mod is a shit is kills the pvp
[2:20:42] Hopefulx: yeah
[2:20:43] nico_natsu: chess pvp is easier than pve too

[2:28:36] d4_damager_: tanks too hard to balance compared to dps or healers
[2:28:53] Toadcop: no they are not
[2:28:58] Zir_aus: @dorki if the key levels were higher would prot war reflect even matter in WM ?
[2:29:27] Toadcop: no

[3:04:39] chromagx: applebees coupon for world i think
[3:04:43] jess0x9: capcom cup is next week with 2 million prize pool with first place getting 1 million dollars, how is MDI prize pool so bad
[3:04:43] n0s0upbr0: WHERES THE COMPUTER MAX ?
[3:04:45] t4pekid: will you go on vacation if you win
[3:04:46] picncbasket: theyll actually practice atal for 80k
[3:05:12] Razdruid: https://liquipedia.net/worldofwarcraft/MDI/2024/A
[3:05:13] wolfeidau: what oled monitor do you use?

[3:05:34] Docaan: Blizzard losing money with no sponsors as well, so having the rewards is cool even if it's not that much
[3:05:38] chromagx: for a multi billion $ company they could increase the payout
[3:05:41] Whitewolf1441: @criselbart cant eat clout
[3:05:46] n0s0upbr0: how much is it @chromagx
[3:05:46] Razdruid: 1st in the final gives each of you 16k
[3:05:56] n0s0upbr0: 16k for each player ?
[3:06:09] Razdruid: second in finals gives each of you 8k per player
[3:06:13] Bareno: @Whitewolf1441 but you can turn clout into higher stream viewer count which might mean more subs :)
[3:06:14] Razdruid: and yeah 16k per player for first
[3:06:23] n0s0upbr0: I guess that’s not that bad
[3:06:24] Fi9e: HC Makgora had 100k prize pool and it was a random streamer event. Blizz should increase the money for mdi and co
[3:06:33] t4pekid: 16k in this economy?!
[3:06:39] n0s0upbr0: but nothing life changing
[3:06:49] n0s0upbr0: 16k will get you a shitty used car with 150k miles on it
[3:06:50] Docaan: True
[3:06:52] CrerisRs: @Fi9e the finals have higher prize pool than that so
[3:06:57] craigward: we know you
[3:06:57] n0s0upbr0: meanwhile limit max is robbing fundraiser money
[3:06:58] jess0x9: all they got to do is put a mount or pet in the blizz store where even 50% goes to MDI and you instantly gonna get a multi-million dollar prize pool
[3:06:58] MightyGIGACHAD: I know method NA JB god
[3:06:58] n0s0upbr0: yikes

[3:12:19] surselith: Have to kill the mobs in the area to spawn in the rare. Only pops one for the quest, but if you keep killing, they keep spawning
[3:12:20] n0s0upbr0: once I heard it the person told me to spread the news to everyone
[3:12:28] n0s0upbr0: so I answered the call
[3:12:28] rottisxd: or you would assert dominance by streaming

[3:12:39] Zir_aus: @n0s0upbr0 i dunno ur just a chatter chatting atm , without receipts that is.

[3:17:41] Milano___: twitch.tv/dorkiz?
[3:17:49] jess0x9: if u were a real streamer u would re-enact getting it and popping off for content
[3:18:14] bingo_roswell: what are you farming rates for?
[3:18:25] sorliee: For fun, dorki is a casual gamer
[3:18:32] kj01a: more of a damn finally moment LUL
[3:18:55] sorliee: Ngl getting leggo was fun but the questline ruined it for me
[3:19:02] wynter1: having to get out of combat for the rares is most annoying part i had
[3:19:18] bingo_roswell: legendary quest line looks painful
[3:19:29] juniper_xd: isn't there a potion or something that can get you out of combat?
[3:19:29] Halt57: meta for farming leggo shit to just change to night elf?
[3:19:32] chukudu: just race change to NE
