[0:19:04] ratgefingah: hullo
[0:19:11] Ch4rm0s14n: afternoon dude
[0:19:12] FelPlague: It def feels like there is not ENOUGH different, 1 raid and the runes and a pvp event is... great but was kinda hoping for more.
[0:19:14] NeeK_23: mrgmHelloThere
[0:19:14] Demeternoth: hai
[0:19:15] ratgefingah: arthur LUL
[0:19:20] Jelky55: everyone is here
[0:19:28] Raidr211: yo
[0:19:42] Jelky55: also Dan 2 more months and im subbed for a year, do i get something?
[0:19:43] Lausten: HeyGuys
[0:19:59] Jelky55: ok i ll take it
[0:20:25] nash25pl: right ok i have to apologise to @MrGM i miss understood how the Naxx works :)  I though i can only get tokens on 10man instance
[0:20:30] twin_cloud: That was my dinner last night lol
[0:20:36] ratgefingah: big vibes ay
[0:20:38] Kimdah_: Tomato soup and a toastie just hit that sweet spot
[0:20:50] Raidr211: put a slice of ham in that grilled cheese then its perfect
[0:21:09] nash25pl: Naxx raid has 2 mods 25 and 10 man and everywhere said run it on 10man so i though it only way to get all the tokens
[0:21:10] Kimdah_: That's pretty much a dissassembled pizza tbh
[0:21:11] yamiwolf96: hey mrgm so what you got left on bfa
[0:21:47] Kimdah_: @Raidr211 Agree, ham and cheese toasties are bis
[0:21:55] NeeK_23: oh thats a daily rotation achievement
[0:22:24] Kimdah_: So weird, dynamic flyin above Boralus
[0:23:01] Kimdah_: It makes it feel so different ngl
[0:23:16] Kimdah_: Lemme use my Cloud Serpents damn it
[0:23:45] BBMezzy: Using the same dragonriding mounts has become quite monotonous
[0:23:55] Kimdah_: Cloud Serpents are technically dragons too
[0:24:14] Jelky55: if we get dinamic flying for horse mounts would that be......... *inhales*... horse riding? XD
[0:24:15] NeeK_23: I wanna see non winged mounts animations, like Mimi;s head or one of the rockets
[0:25:12] ratgefingah: we need jetpack dynamic flight for rockets and stuff have different dynamic flight systems LUL
[0:25:38] funviking99: I wanna know more about that mount in war within they showed at blizzcon
[0:25:40] Kimdah_: Have you seen how our character sits on the Cata epic upgrade mount?
[0:25:47] Kimdah_: That just looks.. Weird
[0:25:54] funviking99: that looked cool
[0:26:02] ratgefingah: @funviking99 the delves thing ?
[0:26:20] Kimdah_: Your character doesnt sit still
[0:26:52] NeeK_23: Gnomes on the mechawheel is my favourite model as they cant reach and have to stand up
[0:26:58] Kimdah_: Runebound Firelord is the name of the mount on Retail
[0:27:11] ratgefingah: as someone whos most played genre is roguelikes, I wanna know more about delves
[0:27:40] Kimdah_: Odd, look at the one on classic
[0:27:54] Kimdah_: Classic name: avatar of flame
[0:28:01] ratgefingah: oh I thought it was a bit thorgast inspired
[0:28:17] Kimdah_: WoWhead Wotlk should have it
[0:28:19] ratgefingah: mb then , gotta read up on what we know already again LUL
[0:28:52] Jelky55: feed me your hate
[0:28:53] Jelky55: do it
[0:28:59] physalis4: Were you caught in the fire from the Azmon drama?
[0:29:12] Jelky55: make a guide on m+ pls LUL
[0:29:12] NeeK_23: im expecting Delves to be like non timed solo dungeons with a follower and some puzzles like the niffen digs
[0:29:45] Layliah79: it's been almost 5 months since Blizzcon. i had forgotten some of the stuff. you're video was great!
[0:29:50] melph: People are idiots ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[0:29:58] Layliah79: ^^
[0:29:58] shaypressplay: What is wrong with people? I like the video myself
[0:30:01] ratgefingah: but honestly, wow players are super fukin whiny, they r up there with league players
[0:30:09] funviking99: the drought is real, no content , no ptr stuff ..
[0:30:59] NeeK_23: this isnt a drought.....damn some patches went 6months without anything
[0:31:03] shaypressplay: they are bored
[0:31:24] physalis4: bored...no distractions
[0:31:30] NeeK_23: nah, some people are just assholes
[0:31:30] Thoreya: 4 weeks without a patch and ppl start losing it
[0:31:32] Thoreya: lol
[0:31:52] tildo03: I am really inspired

[0:33:10] Larkaro: Why is community so self destructive
[0:33:11] tildo03: It's a coward behind a keyboard
[0:33:28] NeeK_23: I posted a video and my only comment I got was telling me my UI was shit

[0:33:45] ratgefingah: @NeeK_23 damn

[0:35:09] NeeK_23: a little quiet
[0:35:13] ratgefingah: nah it was foine
[0:35:33] Demeternoth: I am old innit... i need to turn everything up XD
[0:35:34] Kimdah_: I tweeted you a video of the animation of the Avatar of flame @MrGM
[0:35:43] stephanie23: Morning Everyone! Have a good Thursday. =)
[0:35:57] Kimdah_: Twitter screwed w my quality
[0:36:32] tildo03: where is the avatar of flame from
[0:36:42] Jelky55: i think i might know why all the hate, you get to have interviews with all wow devs and everyone, and is famous yet you dont do high endgame content like mythic raid or +30 keys but being a good content creator goes beyond timing high keys imo
[0:36:47] Jelky55: big text sorry xD
[0:36:49] Kimdah_: Epic Cata classic
[0:36:58] tildo03: oh.  I have it then]
[0:37:23] Jelky55: u dont think its the jealousy?
[0:37:41] Jelky55: /shrug
[0:37:46] tildo03: your beard?
[0:37:55] tildo03: jealous of your beard?
[0:38:08] SlithTheSivak: its obviously his over bearing britishness
[0:38:29] Larkaro: jealous of the Alexstraza statue
[0:38:39] ratgefingah: most of the ppl who hate u propably comment seriously and unironically on wowhead articles and wow forums
[0:38:48] nether12234: It might just be that people see the video and think there is new breaking info which they'll hype themselves up for and then realise that it's a "What we know so far" like you've said and then they're just mad at themselves for hyping themselves up for no reason
[0:39:29] SlithTheSivak: like looking at a pretty picture, then realizing its AI art, people get REALLY mad for some reason
[0:39:56] ratgefingah: I like ur vids man FeelsOkayMan
[0:40:31] ratgefingah: oh yeah that one
[0:40:48] ratgefingah: nah I just saw it
[0:41:09] ratgefingah: ah ok didnt saw that one
[0:41:37] Lausten: Guess its your good stalker/death threat friend O_o
[0:41:51] Larkaro: hate engagement makes me ill
[0:41:53] mikeygames: oi oi Dannyboy!
[0:42:04] mikeygames: thoughts on what could be on the reverred faction?
[0:42:52] mikeygames: dragon riding LUL
[0:44:51] Queerfocused: no
[0:44:59] ratgefingah: wait is erosium the wow economy guy?
[0:45:17] Queerfocused: he was running wod dungeons for warforged gear
[0:45:19] TulanOnTwitch: Essaying
[0:45:45] mikeygames: why would that result in a ban?
[0:45:52] Queerfocused: he spent like 60 plus hours running the dugeons for the gear and got banned
[0:45:58] mikeygames: I reckon he was just a naughty boy
[0:46:09] TulanOnTwitch: Susge
[0:46:33] BBMezzy: Did you see the reddit thread about the guy testing CS by creating a ticket about appealing a ban while not actually being banned?
[0:46:53] Queerfocused: Archvaldor created a video about it too
[0:47:03] TulanOnTwitch: I believe it
[0:47:05] Queerfocused: about his ban
[0:47:11] Queerfocused: yea
[0:47:17] Queerfocused: twinking
[0:47:21] BBMezzy: I'll send you a link. The state of CS is sad
[0:47:24] mikeygames: I'm scared of getting banned on SoD from opening 30 solid chests within an hour ha, reverred now though so don't need the supplies anymore
[0:47:26] Queerfocused: Archvaldor created a video about his ban
[0:47:38] Lausten: @Queerfocused With that logic I should be banned from ICC by now Kappa
[0:48:06] gi_wesp: @mikeygames where do you find 30 chests in 1h? :O
[0:48:18] Larkaro: IMO i think its absolutely fine that we are in a content/new void at the moment because I think from April to Launch we are going to be flooded with information
[0:48:39] mikeygames: @gi_wesp there's more than that, prob like 30-40 or so
[0:48:59] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:49:12] funviking99: no content, no news
[0:49:14] funviking99: sad times
[0:49:30] nash25pl: people like to be salty for no reason
[0:49:35] mikeygames: no issues with them, just another button to press
[0:49:58] Lausten: Its just button bloat
[0:49:58] NeeK_23: some think is covenants where you  might want to be a Dark Ranger for aesthetics, but the meta pick might be the other one
[0:49:59] SlithTheSivak: that also change the way u play ur spec, its like artifact weapons from legion
[0:50:05] Thoreya: i like how the video changed its title, was very dumb
[0:50:22] mikeygames: too early to tell isn't it I imagine, for myself Dark Ranger, I'd like the aesthetics and yeah maybe a 'skin' or something
[0:50:30] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:50:39] ratgefingah: im curious what the progression on delves will be like, like if all of them open up at once and its a gear issue where the delves in zone 4 r harder than the ones in zone 1 or if they open up weekly or smt
[0:51:03] mikeygames: @gi_wesp What realm are you on?
[0:51:18] ratgefingah: or mby all delves have different wings like thorgast hm
[0:51:19] Thoreya: they said the highest difficulty of delves will be equiv to like a +15
[0:51:25] mikeygames: I'm nervous about Delves being time gated because they're on the reward track thing aren't they.
[0:51:28] NeeK_23: if they made it only cosmetics, half the players would be mad there's no power. If it was power the other half would be mad its not class skins
[0:51:41] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[0:51:44] ratgefingah: as long as delves arent required for bis gear like thorgast all is fine i think
[0:51:50] Larkaro: Are we going to get a ripcord 2.0
[0:52:03] Thoreya: i think its fine, theyre adding another row for the vault for delves lol
[0:52:05] NeeK_23: end of the day, noone knows yet since its just a handful of screenshots so far
[0:52:06] SlithTheSivak: they havnt release my spec yet so i dont know whether to be upset or not
[0:52:08] Thoreya: for casuals
[0:52:11] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[0:52:49] mrsrockguru: It's jsut to give peeps who dont do dungeons or raids, end spec gear equivalent to raids or mythic +
[0:53:06] Thoreya: yep
[0:53:15] mrsrockguru: yeah I'm looking forward to that
[0:53:17] mikeygames: they're on the reward track though aren't they of the vault? so you'd be limited ot how many you can do a week no?
[0:53:32] dright424: in my opinion they are adding delves to get casual players going to the vault weekly
[0:53:34] Thoreya: they said u can do unlimited
[0:53:34] ratgefingah: m+ isnt limited ye
[0:53:39] Thoreya: but itll prob just stop at 10 for vault
[0:53:59] ratgefingah: lots of ppl have m+ anxiety so thats awesome for them
[0:54:01] mikeygames: 100% hope they are procedurally generated
[0:54:20] Layliah79: i thought they were
[0:54:27] NeeK_23: I think they said Vault would cap at gear level equal to a +15 key which is currently heroic gear
[0:54:34] Layliah79: KEKW
[0:54:45] ratgefingah: the vault is capped to 9 but delves will prop be unlimited
[0:54:49] ratgefingah: at least i hope so
[0:54:59] Layliah79: this is why we follow you! <3
[0:55:23] Layliah79: idk why i thought TW dungeons counted as M0s for vault lol
[0:55:27] mikeygames: oof! someone on SoD got banned for accepting 40g to heal a raid, now they've been banned
[0:55:59] NeeK_23: we close to KSM?
[0:56:08] NeeK_23: ah nice
[0:56:14] nash25pl: 3k IO when ?
[0:56:22] Layliah79: just pay in materials! they can sell them for the gold then
[0:56:22] yuldovah42: go do KSH
[0:56:28] Lausten: 2500 at least
[0:56:34] ratgefingah: if delves are good im gonna try to make delve speedrunning a thing
[0:56:52] NeeK_23: your diving into the end, youre not gonna enjoy.
[0:56:53] nash25pl: world to first delve
[0:57:14] Layliah79: MDI 2.0 - Mythic Delve Invitational - coming soon
[0:57:25] NeeK_23: at least you can flex on Cham for a few weeks
[0:57:50] Layliah79: i miss tables
[0:58:29] nash25pl: can we queue to warfronts HC solo pls
[0:58:30] Layliah79: so much free gold each expansion
[0:58:31] fetza108: i liked bfa man
[0:58:41] ratgefingah: I just heard that mission table made a lot of passive gold if you played it correctly
[0:58:45] NeeK_23: I didnt mind it. I dont miss it though
[0:58:52] physalis4: I think I'm done with this Azerothian Archive event...rep is pointless, and the cost of the rewards is insane
[0:58:55] MichaelRamm: Good morning/afternoon, everyone! One day left in the work week!!
[0:59:27] physalis4: 30k currency just for a hat and a backpack xmog
[0:59:28] mikeygames: last epoch if the servers aren't on fire
[0:59:30] ratgefingah: @physalis4 Im almost at 4/5 rep , and i barely did them I think doing one weekly is the strat
[0:59:37] nash25pl: god damn dentist trip for me tomz not a good weekend
[0:59:47] MichaelRamm: Wrath...Wrath...Wrath grinding to 80 on my prot pally
[1:00:11] mikeygames: 10 minutes?
[1:00:17] mikeygames: bet it cost a fortune
[1:00:17] NeeK_23: Weekend of Hell Divers for me
[1:00:22] NeeK_23: if servers are up
[1:00:39] Grissu_: @physalis4 it's insane how much you need to grind to buy everything. 11 months of doing only weekly quest LUL
[1:00:46] mikeygames: a more refined Diablo
[1:00:46] NeeK_23: its Starship troopers basically
[1:00:47] Layliah79: similar to D4
[1:00:50] ratgefingah: its an old arpg that had a remake
[1:00:55] mikeygames: check the technical trailer on youtube
[1:00:55] NeeK_23: Last Epoch is Diablo basically
[1:00:57] physalis4: D4 knockoff
[1:00:57] ratgefingah: just came out
[1:01:06] MichaelRamm: Last Epoch is a new ARPG that released yesterday...it is easier than PoE and better than D4
[1:01:07] Lausten: I just do the weekly quest for AA dig, theres a chance to get any of the rewards right? Didnt you get the mount from killing the dragon or something @MrGM ?
[1:01:13] Grissu_: it's more like poe + lost ark
[1:01:18] MichaelRamm: @physalis4 no where near accurate
[1:01:36] ratgefingah: @Lausten I got the hat and the pants from the event itself and the hornstrider mount
[1:01:54] MichaelRamm: @kingbrthur wrong...it has been in early access for about 5 years and finally released 1.0
[1:02:03] Lausten: @kingbrthur Is taht the mount the one that cost 20k from the vendor?
[1:02:08] physalis4: @MichaelRamm I watched a few hrs...it looks exactly like D4. Even the inventory screen looks like Diablo. I'm sure details are different.
[1:02:11] ratgefingah: theres also the azeroth archive wq u can do thats 1.5k every 3 days
[1:02:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:02:37] NeeK_23: I'll have raided 4 times this week by Sunday plus M+ and after loverocket runs. A nice weekend off wow is needed
[1:02:37] ratgefingah: @Lausten nah hornstrider is the drop and the other ones smt else scalehide or smt
[1:02:53] MichaelRamm: @physalis4 that is called being an ARPG...so of course there are similarities....it is far from a 'knockoff'
[1:02:57] ratgefingah: @MichaelRamm aight, a friend tried to explain it to me I propably got it wrong
[1:03:08] BBMezzy: Last rank is 9500 rep
[1:03:11] Lausten: @kingbrthur Oh shit, this event will be the bane of me..
[1:03:25] NeeK_23: then next week its DDI practice
[1:03:30] BBMezzy: It's 10.5k, 10.5k, 11.5k, 9.5k. Why? Fuck knows
[1:03:37] Lausten: But to be honest, until they fix the fucking phasing bug in outdoor Dragonflight im not doing any DF content..
[1:03:58] MichaelRamm: never seen that either
[1:04:12] ratgefingah: you sometimes randomly get phased to another shard when you just engaged a rare
[1:04:26] Lausten: permission to post a link?
[1:04:37] NeeK_23: you mean Breezebiter? thats because of the dig

[1:12:54] Lausten: @demololtv Yeah thats true
[1:12:57] NeeK_23: his chat isnt full of 14 year olds and its well modded
[1:13:25] Layliah79: Towelliee's too
[1:13:33] demololtv: hes also been around forever like you and i'd say most of his viewers are OG and they wouldn't be toxic towards someone they've watched for 10+ years
[1:13:53] Lausten: Boomer streamers, thats why :D
[1:14:08] demololtv: haha true tho @Lausten
[1:14:57] Etaranel: I'm 67 so I only watch you and Preach. Can't be bothered with crass behaviour any more.

[1:20:45] nash25pl: like 10 sausuge roll during a day lot
[1:20:54] physalis4: I'd say it's only a problem if you're using it as a crutch or an escape
[1:21:08] physalis4: as someone who's been on that side of it
[1:21:28] Lausten: Havent been drunk since 2020
[1:21:40] nash25pl: hangover mcdonald is bliss
[1:22:00] physalis4: getting Covid helped me quit. Went cold turkey for like 2 weeks.
[1:22:06] SlithTheSivak: ur body needs electrolytes to replenish what u lost, bacon is literally medicine
[1:22:22] physalis4: maybe not quit, but cut back a ton
[1:22:44] ratgefingah: anyone know why centaurs trophy necjlaces go for so much rn?
[1:22:50] SlithTheSivak: i thought a full english was the hangover cure of choice for brits
[1:22:55] ratgefingah: kust sold 3 for 35k
[1:23:03] SinicalDev: I never really drink at home, I'll drink on a night out but being home and drinking feels a bit pointless. Neither of the GFs I've lived with drink much either though
[1:23:24] Lausten: @kingbrthur They are only available from Hunts so they are a scarce resource
[1:23:24] ratgefingah: also shadowflame essence, if you have any laying around nows the time to flip them
[1:23:35] ratgefingah: @Lausten oh nice
[1:23:39] NeeK_23: @kingbrthur you need them to craft bis crafted gear for some classes
[1:23:46] nash25pl: why freehold ?

[1:35:27] SinicalDev: I was explaining how classic is different to retail to my GF and showed her the trip to go get my berserker stance from Southshore, and she was like this is just a massive waste of time and I kinda agree lol
[1:35:54] SinicalDev: from southshore to ratchet yeah
[1:35:55] Grissu_: for me personally playing sod is very fun, but watching it is not unless it's pvp. I prefer watching hardcore than sod for pve
[1:35:56] LuiBMHunter: AaaaaChoooo! oops sneezed all over chat
[1:35:57] SinicalDev: fucking mission

[1:40:56] SinicalDev: Water man*
[1:41:14] Lausten: Its not designed for rank 1 pets
[1:41:14] NeeK_23: you need specific abilities
[1:41:38] Larkaro: it wont
[1:41:58] FlutterBaby: is that how we sound? hahaha
[1:42:00] NeeK_23: you go to xufus to download your collection then upload the comp

[1:43:39] Lausten: Biggest issue is not having rank 3 abilities unlocked, most pets have their main ability be a 1 attack ability where as the number 2 and 3 abilities usually do more powerful stuff
[1:43:56] Lakatarmen: either that or pets with stampede

[1:46:11] NeeK_23: filters isnt how you use rematch. but if you arent into it then no point learning
[1:46:23] LuiBMHunter: coo 96% done ish
[1:47:13] LuiBMHunter: best thing about rematch is letting you save combos of pets for particular targets
[1:47:39] NeeK_23: thats what it does
[1:47:41] MachoCham: That's literally what it does but you have to download the teams
[1:47:41] Lausten: Thats what Xufu is for
[1:47:52] NeeK_23: nope
[1:48:01] Lausten: You of course need the pets andthe levels for it
[1:48:05] MachoCham: Download the team, download the script. Press one button. Win.
[1:48:20] BBMezzy: It's a little bit of effort, very much worth it when you've built up your pet collection
[1:48:59] mikeygames: As a noob to pets, pet battle scripts and rematch = win win
[1:49:03] nash25pl: if you have charms just buy pet levels with charms
[1:49:04] MachoCham: Yeah, that is a bit of an issue for some things you want to do
[1:49:14] BBMezzy: That's easily solved with using mission tables to collect pet tokens
[1:49:23] Lausten: Yeah it takes collecting pets in starting zones, then leveling them and then expanding that way
[1:49:24] AndAsh05: ARE YOU NOT A FAN OF PET BATTLES?

[1:51:01] Silverwards: business expense it
[1:51:17] LuiBMHunter: priorities right?
[1:51:26] mikeygames: DDKP Run ? to get gold (Dans Dragon Kill Points)
[1:51:27] nash25pl: ah i have perks of being single male i dont have to reason with anyone else KEKW
[1:51:28] Lausten: @Silverwards Thats not how it works
[1:51:31] Larkaro: think of the resell value of the pets
[1:51:34] AndAsh05: now only if you could use the gyphon IRL

[1:52:14] MachoCham: Up north around our way you'd be looking at 210-250 I'd say for your house
[1:52:19] SinicalDev: We're buying a house atm and it's so stressful lol
[1:52:22] nash25pl: about 5% atm in UK
[1:52:33] SkelebobTV: @demololtv 5% ish in the uk
[1:52:42] demololtv: best u can really get right now here in the US is around 8%
[1:53:06] nash25pl: UK going into recession will mean interest rate should drop
[1:53:06] SinicalDev: Yeah we're buying an Edwardian and there's so much random shit like covenants etc.
[1:53:20] mikeygames: does your ui layout have an import string Dan? even though it's just the standard DF ui?
[1:53:26] SinicalDev: @demololtv Our rates aren't set for the life of the mortgage, usually they're set for 2 or 5 years at a time
[1:53:41] MachoCham: My Parents 3 bed terrace is now up for sale at 215
[1:53:48] MachoCham: Welcome to north
[1:53:54] nash25pl: @MrGM just put it on discord
[1:54:19] nash25pl: @MrGM i bought 3 bed new build in manchester 2 years ago for 200k not its estaimted at close to 250k-300k <3
[1:54:24] LuiBMHunter: my mums house is a 3 bed terrace - would imagine it's around ¬£120K ...
[1:54:49] SinicalDev: We're paying ¬£320k for a 4 bed Edwardian mid terrace with a cellar in Northampton - we both work remote so moving up a bit closer to her family
[1:54:58] LuiBMHunter: Great Yarmouth ...
[1:55:12] MachoCham: Yorkshire innit
[1:56:14] nash25pl: depends where in manchester i chose to live on the very edge of manchester just cause its more quiet
[1:56:27] LuiBMHunter: only really need two rooms - one for streaming and one for living ...
[1:56:30] tildo03: what are you farming for
[1:57:11] LuiBMHunter: you making this look easy compared to the supposed stas in MDI :)
[1:57:52] LuiBMHunter: stars
[1:58:06] alicemch: LULW
[1:58:06] demololtv: i cant wait until items u recieve are account wide and don't matter what it is to be added into ur wardrobe
[1:58:13] SkelebobTV: Some agents don't let you arrange a viewing without your house on the market if you're not a first time buyer
[1:58:22] alicemch: @demololtv yesss!
[1:58:37] JakeSezz: What is the median house cost in your area? Just curious what it is there compared to here in the states
[1:58:54] demololtv: i didnt have to put a down payment thank god on mine
[1:58:55] SinicalDev: We should have US style open viewing days
[1:59:13] demololtv: it was diplos house
[1:59:26] LuiBMHunter: so you spend all your time looking at tech instead of the house :)
[1:59:45] AndAsh05: I always found viewing someones house awkward.
[1:59:56] LuiBMHunter: suuuure
[1:59:57] SinicalDev: The house we thought was the nicest by the advert was actually the worst IRL, it was owned by an architect with a porsche but the finish was really poor and had damp
[2:00:48] LuiBMHunter: you could take videos and let chat vote on which one you get :)
[2:00:59] SkelebobTV: I don't envy you having to sell your house to be honest, selling my last house was a pain in the ass.... 2 buyers pulled out on us

[2:19:19] Bears_Adventures: Your pets arent all level 25.
[2:19:20] Iwony: yxou have small pets not all abilities
[2:19:22] MachoCham: It might be because your level is too low
[2:19:26] Lausten: Yeah his issue is that hes not got full level 1 team
[2:19:26] Bears_Adventures: They all need to be level 1 or all level 25
[2:19:27] BBMezzy: Your team doesn't match what you imported
[2:19:29] Layliah79: oh yeah!
[2:19:33] The9thChevron: pets are in the wrong order
[2:19:40] Lausten: @Bears_Adventures This
[2:19:45] NeeK_23: you have level 1 and level 25 in one team
[2:19:46] SlithTheSivak: if u load all level 1 pets, ur opponant will also only have level 1 pets
[2:19:47] Layliah79: KEKW
[2:19:58] Bears_Adventures: They all need to be level 1 or all level 25
[2:20:10] MachoCham: Because your bird is 25 the pets you fight are 25. So your level 1 doesn't stand a chance
[2:20:16] SlithTheSivak: u only need level 1 pets!
[2:20:18] Layliah79: it's because your Ikky is 25 not 1
[2:20:21] LuiBMHunter: do all level 1s
[2:20:31] NeeK_23: put in level1 ikky
[2:20:32] SlithTheSivak: take out the level 25 and only use level 1s
[2:20:36] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:20:37] Lausten: Buy a level 1 ikky

[2:21:41] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[2:21:42] LuiBMHunter: either all level 1's OR all level 25's
[2:21:49] SlithTheSivak: pet level is really more important than specific pets
[2:21:57] NeeK_23: pet leveling stream friday?
[2:21:58] LuiBMHunter: just stick a level 1 as 3rd pet you might be fine
[2:22:09] Layliah79: i have 2000 pets Dx
[2:22:26] Lausten: Got any ways to level more pets? Polished Pet Charms?
[2:23:01] NeeK_23: script wont work as different team
[2:23:05] MachoCham: Script wont work as your pets are different
[2:23:13] SlithTheSivak: press 1, u just skipped ur turn
[2:23:57] Layliah79: once you do all the achievements for collecting pets might be easier.
[2:24:03] Lausten: Yeah its like doing dungeons, if you dont have the gear you're not doing miffys
[2:24:22] SlithTheSivak: wat
[2:24:37] Lausten: Never seen that before lol
[2:24:44] NeeK_23: on cooldown
[2:25:04] Lausten: Thats odd
[2:25:22] MachoCham: Can't wait for the video saying pet battles are dead

[2:26:09] zantos2020: I do pet battles every day
[2:26:12] SlithTheSivak: i got into pet battles during WoD, there are a lot of awesome toys related to it that are completely unique
[2:26:15] BBMezzy: Source of achievement points and some world quests gave rep so it helped speed up getting reputation with new factions
[2:26:17] Layliah79: i do them for the achievements mostly
[2:26:19] NeeK_23: the pet might be strong but that ability might not be
[2:26:25] zantos2020: There are some addons that make it super easy
[2:26:54] NeeK_23: doing my one Osidian Warders pet battle for exalted rep
[2:26:56] MachoCham: Autobattle uses the script
[2:27:01] LuiBMHunter: addicted now aren't you :)
[2:27:06] MachoCham: Which won't work if you don't have the same pets
[2:27:24] mikeygames: can you use level 1 pets for bfa world quests?!
[2:27:28] Iwony: It takes a long time to do all those achievments but if you keep going ... :) it needs motivation though....
[2:27:29] mikeygames: I've been buying level 25s
[2:27:50] SlithTheSivak: magic pet mirrors work in battlegrounds, i like to fight players as a broom
[2:27:53] Lausten: @mikeygames Yeah, but they level from batles so its not viable very long
[2:28:38] NeeK_23: thats why we talk about Super Squirt Day. you can level 1-25 in two battles for one day every few months. good for leveling to battle or sell on AH
[2:28:42] mikeygames: I normally level pets via super squirt day and the auto battler, while watching netflix
[2:29:08] SlithTheSivak: using all level 1s is FAR easier to build teams for, and the games take less time overall
[2:29:33] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak But they wont be level 1 for very long though
[2:29:44] zantos2020: Most of the Legion trainers are good for leveling pets
[2:29:44] thunduz: hello there.

[2:32:54] Iwony: pet battle dungeon ports are darn nice and the title is my favourite"Minion of Mayham" <3
[2:33:49] LuiBMHunter: is 23 level 70's a lot? or am I slacking?
[2:34:10] MachoCham: Compared to what?
[2:34:25] LuiBMHunter: the average? *shrug*
[2:34:26] Redivna: it is a lot
[2:35:16] Redivna: I would say anything more than 1 level 70 per class would be a  lot, but also having all classes at level 70 is a lot also

[2:37:20] Iwony: @LuiBMHunter I think I have around the same... but I have more 60s to level ^^
[2:37:27] Phenroi: 23 seems fine, I have 27 70s, so it's reasonible
[2:37:27] MediumRareOG: mechagon 100% would take months

[2:42:01] jdodge1305: it's hard to solo, but you can. have to outrange the flying robot during phase 2
[2:42:13] MediumRareOG: mechagon hard mode is 100% solvable. I did it
[2:42:21] NeeK_23: the tower always kills me on hardmode
[2:42:41] UnhaltedGB: Yes Sadge
[2:43:05] Niixten: there is a bug/exploit on last boss
[2:43:13] NeeK_23: how does he do the tower??
[2:43:51] MediumRareOG: this method is correct. it‚Äôs what I did
[2:44:42] NeeK_23: I just farm this boss for the mount each week. one day it'll drop
[2:44:49] MediumRareOG: @neek_23 you run out of range and it bugs out
[2:45:32] NeeK_23: @MediumRareOG out of range of this tower?
[2:45:46] prynnibr: Hard mode happens when you defeat the other 3 in hard mode
[2:45:51] BBMezzy: hard mode does not affect the mount drop chance on the 4th boss
[2:45:51] MachoCham: 1/500 is better than 1/3000
[2:46:05] Sleepyjoegaming: sleepy75Hi
[2:46:33] MediumRareOG: @neek_23 yes. there are videos on it
[2:46:37] Sleepyjoegaming: my man!
[2:46:39] NeeK_23: you can still tame a unique mecha pet where, a yellow or black mechadog
[2:46:42] Layliah79: i got super lucky. the first time killing that boss in BFA i got that mount. I almost fainted cause things like that never happen to me.
[2:46:45] Sleepyjoegaming: oh really oh god haha
[2:46:49] Sleepyjoegaming: yea sure shoot
[2:47:10] NeeK_23: Kujo the boss is black, the ones before Kujo are yellow

[2:50:03] thunduz: YoshiP is coming for MRGM
[2:50:03] MachoCham: But I don't stream the full screen, it's cropped for viewers at standard size
[2:50:14] MachoCham: I just get the extra bits on the side
[2:50:34] NeeK_23: FF14 had drama where people got banned for using an addon that mimiced ultrawide settings to see the whole boss arena, even though its the same as ultrawide players
[2:51:04] thunduz: he‚Äôs going to force you to play FF14 and laugh at all the laughable bits and cry hysterically at the heart wrenching ones
[2:51:14] NeeK_23: pay to win,just need ultrawide screen

[2:56:16] MachoCham: I see all those chairs and expect Mox to do a suplex on them back to back. Wrestling has broken me
[2:56:18] Phats66: stiff upper lip
[2:56:24] Lausten: You're just British Kappa
[2:56:31] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:56:34] funviking99: Kappa
[2:56:40] SlithTheSivak: Metzen is legit one of my heroes
[2:56:42] NeeK_23: screaming and crying? no. But I had a moment watching the cinematic,  but im a lore person
[2:57:08] mikeygames: Too much 'bloat' in WoW I honestly don't know the story anymore
[2:57:09] MachoCham: Deme did at the Blue dragon thing with Sindragosa
[2:57:12] thunduz: @machocham yeah Tali would enrage some because he wasn‚Äôt crying or raging at characters lol
[2:57:13] Sleepyjoegaming: dno when king wryen went offt i nearly shed a tear
[2:57:25] SlithTheSivak: there arent a ton of tear jerker moments in wow but they havnt played up that aspect, i think there will be TEARS in war withing, i already have bets going on who is dying
[2:57:33] funviking99: Except the war within cinematic, that hit me right in the feels
[2:57:33] SlithTheSivak: Ysera dying I cried
[2:57:49] Harai_Ulfsark: i cried on the ysera dying cinematic back in legion, and again in the finale for the blue dragon questline
[2:57:52] NeeK_23: wow lore is alot of text dumps in quests that people click away and ignore. Then they say things dont make sense watching out of context cutscenes
[2:57:52] thunduz: Maraad dying had me say nooooooooo but I didn‚Äôt cry lol
[2:57:55] physalis4: Only time was when Ysera died
[2:58:06] Arlaeya: I'm a lore nerd. I cry. I was Very Upset for Anduin sitting in that arena
[2:58:07] BisonD: do you cry with anything your child does?
[2:58:13] MachoCham: I cried when I had to go back to the Maw in 9.2
[2:58:19] SlithTheSivak: Ur alliance so u wont care a ton, but I think Thrall will die in War Within
[2:58:32] thunduz: I don‚Äôt cry at games. they just don‚Äôt hit me in that way
[2:58:43] funviking99: crying is ok guys
[2:58:54] SlithTheSivak: Thrall dying will have players in mourning
[2:58:59] BisonD: Only game i've cried at was TLOU
[2:59:00] thunduz: no one is saying crying is wrong
[2:59:03] Sleepyjoegaming: @thunduz dom santiago in gears of war 3  had me blubbering
[2:59:19] funviking99: I hope they don‚Äôt kill Thrall
[2:59:28] MachoCham: I think some people get so hyped and worked up that the nervous energy can come out in extreme emotions
[2:59:28] NeeK_23: the beauty of wow is that you can get invested and love the lore, pet battles, raiding, m+ or pick and choose what you engage with. every player can play it their way and get something out of it. Except PVP, those people are souless
[2:59:40] thunduz: @sleepyjoegaming ok, that almost got me! good call
[2:59:41] MachoCham: If Thrall dies, I'll get the bunting out from Thatchers funeral
[2:59:52] BunnyEnergy: Im just a emotional person so I cry at sad moments. Like Ysera dying. The war within cinematic. But that's just me.
[3:00:09] NeeK_23: @MachoCham Metzen is back, Thrall has the thickest plot armour
[3:00:12] Harai_Ulfsark: some of the musics they use in cinematics are just powerful, like that music from zin azshari in nazjatar or the one from ysera back in legion
[3:00:16] SlithTheSivak: Anduin is tormented and we know why
[3:00:35] Oswaldovzki: The moment Anduin pointed the sword to thrall and thrall touch it and hold it still
[3:00:36] BunnyEnergy: ^
[3:00:38] Harai_Ulfsark: he got flagged for pvp probably
[3:00:41] NeeK_23: Anduin has years of emotional PTSD and having Thrall reach out to him was moving
[3:00:42] dright424: Anduin had very obvious trauma signals, it was incredibly well made
[3:00:43] Arlaeya: Anduin was traumatized. Like.. he's the little kid who welcomed us to stormwind.
[3:00:45] funviking99: shadowlands left a mark on us too
[3:00:48] SlithTheSivak: its called Empathy MrGM!
[3:01:33] DevoidX: i dunno, i'm guessing that people who get emotional about WoW stuff don't ever watch the news
[3:01:39] SlithTheSivak: some people have been "growing" w anduin since he and they were kids....its a bit jarringg to see him older, more world weary, its relatable
[3:01:45] Oswaldovzki: I didn't cry much when I was younger (20s). Some bad shit happened to me since and I got 'soft', i guess
[3:01:46] funviking99: we grew up with him in a. way
[3:01:46] NeeK_23: That cinematic had dozens of call backs and small moments, people not interested will have missed, whilst those who are did pickup on it
[3:01:55] mikeygames: they need to make some more of those shorts they had, they were brilliant
[3:02:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:02:21] MachoCham: There are shorts coming but paid right?
[3:02:23] Oswaldovzki: Runas! I cried a lot with runas :(
[3:02:38] NeeK_23: if only Emerald Dream was as good as Mechagon
[3:02:43] Oswaldovzki: @MachoCham what
[3:02:46] Harai_Ulfsark: there's a short stories book coming out
[3:02:51] NeeK_23: @MachoCham short stories, not cinematics
[3:02:53] Arlaeya: My job is literally tracking legislation at work and have to keep my emotions switched off. Let me cry in my games as catharsis.

[3:06:03] bojackhorseman2004: are you gonna do an epic reading on stream?
[3:06:07] MachoCham: Interesting it being November
[3:06:08] Nhea_GoW: Yep seems kinda late TBH
[3:06:13] MachoCham: Will be live by then
[3:06:15] chelfx: they look placeholdy
[3:06:27] dright424: yes

[3:06:50] CrowMomocle: loads of public domain books you can read
[3:07:06] Nhea_GoW: Can you mimic Gazlowe :P
[3:07:11] bojackhorseman2004: "Yes if you are publicly performing a copyrighted book and not just reading short passages as examples while doing a review or critiquing the work"
[3:07:14] bojackhorseman2004: is what google told me
[3:07:17] Etaranel: You could read it quietly and we could just watch you.
[3:07:40] dright424: Audio books exist you are acting as a replacement for that product
[3:07:51] MachoCham: Every now and then if you're reading Harry Potter say "Trans lives matter" That's a good critique of the series
[3:07:57] Arlaeya: I know nobbel read The Vow Eternal short story but that's free online. I don't know if the ones in the upcoming book will fall under the same permissions
[3:08:05] bojackhorseman2004: you could just ask blizz for permission
[3:08:08] SlithTheSivak: fair use is less than a chapter
[3:08:18] bojackhorseman2004: or whoever owns the right
[3:08:25] chelfx: so chapter a day
[3:08:28] bojackhorseman2004: "hey do you want free advertisment?"
[3:08:43] Oswaldovzki: You could read and them explain what you red, right?
[3:09:13] MachoCham: I wonder how the Machinima versions of the novels work
[3:09:17] bojackhorseman2004: I am either watching you or nobbel telling me what it contains
[3:10:16] Oswaldovzki: Mechagon is a GRIND

[3:13:44] bojackhorseman2004: I heard EL Cunt man
[3:14:05] CrowMomocle: moving right along ...
[3:14:26] MachoCham: I mean cunt is a staple of the vocabulary

[3:14:37] thunduz: oooooo mrgmHehe
[3:14:38] NeeK_23: its a verb in Oz
[3:14:39] wastedxtime93: Nah, the ladies love to be called it over here lmao
[3:14:46] CrowMomocle: took me some years being in UK to get used to it
[3:15:35] MachoCham: No nameplates is triggering me
[3:16:07] NeeK_23: alt V?
[3:16:19] wastedxtime93: You hyped for the Pokemon Presents on the 27th? Looks like we're possibly getting Gold and Silver on the Switch! <3
[3:16:50] wastedxtime93: Yeah, the listed game or something.
[3:17:28] wastedxtime93: As the kids say,
[3:17:35] wastedxtime93: "Let him cook!"
[3:17:39] NeeK_23: dont need to, we have wow pet battles instead LuL
[3:18:13] bojackhorseman2004: Pokemon people are really carefull about their IP, and it works. There is a reason pokemon has dominated for what? 20-30 years?
[3:18:44] NeeK_23: do kids play them still or is it all 30 year olds?
[3:18:50] MachoCham: Yes
[3:18:52] Oswaldovzki: Sure
[3:18:55] bojackhorseman2004: Hmm
[3:18:56] MachoCham: Just don't tell the classicbros
[3:19:00] bojackhorseman2004: 12 mill subs vs around 2 mill subs
[3:19:10] SlithTheSivak: tokens...
[3:19:26] dright424: the most recent transmog set probably sold more than anything they have ever sold
[3:19:49] NeeK_23: it was just after my time, I was a cool edgy teen when pokemon and harrypotter came out so I kinda have no affection or interest in those IPs
[3:19:50] MachoCham: Didn't they even come out and say at one point recently that Retail keeps the game afloat
[3:19:51] SlithTheSivak: i remember when tokens were unveiled during wod when they were still publishing sub numbers...they stopped publishing them because the metric was no longer their highest value add, tokens more than made up for the drop in subs
[3:19:59] bojackhorseman2004: i wonder how much they make from microtransaction shop and token
[3:20:10] bojackhorseman2004: cuz they prob have 10m less subs than peak
[3:20:40] SlithTheSivak: so at my peak during WoD I was selling 4 tokens a week, that continued well into Legion...and that means people were buying those
[3:20:46] wastedxtime93: I still never unlocked Kul Tirans to this day lmao. Only one left.
[3:21:04] dright424: I don't think token adds that much tbh, its only an extra 5 dollars per token
[3:21:19] MachoCham: People will buy tokens ont op of subs
[3:21:30] bojackhorseman2004: if they make that much, why cant we have more expansions like Legion? where we actually got an appropiate amount of content and dungeons and raids
[3:21:41] SlithTheSivak: 1 token is worth more than a persons sub, whales in wow are the token buyers
[3:22:22] wastedxtime93: I'm on a year sub, but have just been buying tokens so I don't have to pay the $200ish upfront again to get the mounts lol
[3:22:34] Harai_Ulfsark: monkaHmm
[3:22:38] bojackhorseman2004: becuse legion just had flat out more content in it
[3:22:42] bojackhorseman2004: 14 dungeons
[3:22:47] NeeK_23: yeah mean legion where they gave up on WoD to take time to make with a huge content draught between the end of wod and legion?
[3:22:54] bojackhorseman2004: we are getting 8
[3:22:59] bojackhorseman2004: and some remastered
[3:23:00] Harai_Ulfsark: are you even playing dragonflight?
[3:23:14] BTakTTV: question, cuz I'm a noob, can you sell WoW tokens outside of the AH? or is that like frowned upon/illegal?
[3:23:18] MachoCham: But remember that DF uses older dungeons in the M+ pool
[3:23:19] Harai_Ulfsark: people just underestimate world content
[3:23:29] wastedxtime93: Dungeons have been my least played content tbh.
[3:23:31] NeeK_23: DF is 18months long, Legion was over 2 years
[3:23:33] Harai_Ulfsark: @BTakTTV its soulbound
[3:23:49] BTakTTV: @Harai_Ulfsark gotcha
[3:23:54] bojackhorseman2004: legion had more imo, legion added the M+ system, artifact wepons, legion halls, more raids and dungeons
[3:24:18] fooxytv: we have a legion fan :)
[3:24:18] MachoCham: But you also list listed borrowed power systems that everyone shit blood about
[3:24:18] bojackhorseman2004: DF has more "quest style" content
[3:24:19] BTakTTV: I've only ever used one, forgot how I got it, but I'm set to get one soon from the friend recruitment thing, but I'm on yearly sub so not sure what to do with it
[3:24:28] fooxytv: I also liked legion, was a good expansion
[3:24:35] bojackhorseman2004: I am an unashamed legion fan
[3:24:38] MachoCham: Wish the community would make their mind up sometimes
[3:24:38] bojackhorseman2004: Loved that xpac
[3:24:53] sapphire_rosa_: hallo
[3:24:55] NeeK_23: rose tinted legion goggles need to be added in game LuL
[3:25:01] bojackhorseman2004: Agree with the problems, but the good parts made up for it by far
[3:25:02] Oswaldovzki: Dragonflight is, as of now, my favourite expansion. Legion comes in second
[3:25:06] MachoCham: AP grind was terrible
[3:25:19] Lausten: It had design flaws, but I'd say Legion had a ton of content cause of the class halls quest lines
[3:25:33] bojackhorseman2004: AP grinding is terrible if you kill ur fun by grinding hard and compare urself to every other no lifer on the internet
[3:25:44] dright424: I think Legion is highly over rated due to the end patch fixing everything
[3:25:46] Harai_Ulfsark: ok but just from top of my head in DF we have grand hunts, dragonbane siege, obsidian citadel events, dreamsurge, time rifts, big digs, snail race, primalist tomorrow, zskera vaults, dragon customization, profession revamp, talent tree revamp, soup event, fyrakk assaults, super bloom & seeds, blue dragonflight quest
[3:25:52] bojackhorseman2004: ofc u hate ur life if you do 100 maw of souls in a row
[3:26:30] MachoCham: Races
[3:26:31] bojackhorseman2004: Anyone can just list up "features"
[3:26:36] BTakTTV: @Oswaldovzki DF and SL are all I know, since I only started playing back in 2019, and I absolutely adore DF
[3:26:37] BBMezzy: I'm not sure on where I'd place DF.. some patch content was good but there was also things that felt like quantity over quality
[3:26:49] bojackhorseman2004: Mist of pandaria had 100 different identical but indevidual dailies
[3:26:51] BTakTTV: I just wish the world events like the storms, and dream surge stayed more relevant over time
[3:26:52] bojackhorseman2004: didnt make them fun
[3:26:57] Harai_Ulfsark: you cannot say DF is lacking in content while trying an honest argument
[3:26:58] funviking99: @mrgm  wasn‚Äôt there like an event thing where we were seeing past events like when Arthas lost invincible and other things? am I making this up?
[3:27:05] kaijoe_: Even with the Twitter patch?
[3:27:10] NeeK_23: there might be 8 DF dungeons, but we got 3 season of various older  dungeons so it felt like we got much more
[3:27:29] BisonD: i thought 10.2.6 isnt out yet?
[3:27:34] BBMezzy: Sure but I'm not just referring to 10.2.5
[3:27:37] Harai_Ulfsark: @funviking99 yeah those are the chromie dailies added with the time rifts
[3:27:38] Layliah79: neither does Blizzard KEKW
[3:27:50] michelsen909: this man is living in the future :o
[3:27:53] bypized: Well this is not Last Epoch
[3:27:54] Iwony: also it has no real value to get it up to highes rep too
[3:28:11] funviking99: dailies? never seen those wtf
[3:28:12] bojackhorseman2004: Mid patch in legion we got mage towers and, withered training. I take that over seed of this and that
[3:28:22] Lausten: Flaver of the month
[3:28:33] fooxytv: would you try another MMO?
[3:28:33] MachoCham: Mage Tower is still here
[3:28:44] bypized: Its 90 company team that made a game better successor of D2 than Blizzard
[3:28:44] Harai_Ulfsark: @funviking99 its inside the everywhen inn in the bronze dragon area in thaldraszus
[3:28:44] fooxytv: or WoW for life?
[3:28:51] NeeK_23: feels like its being over hyped in order to make peple feel justified in hating D4
[3:29:15] MachoCham: From what I've heard Last Epoch is a mid point between D4 and Path of Exile
[3:29:21] fooxytv: I feel the combat in WoW is amazing
[3:29:21] Lausten: No offence, but you would lose me as a viewer if you didnt play wow..
[3:29:26] bojackhorseman2004: @MachoCham yes but not as new content, i cant do my first time in the mage tower again. Becuse DF didnt add a new mage tower. Legion added it.
[3:29:29] Oswaldovzki: Exactly! I've played a lot of MMOsover the year, but WoW is still top 1
[3:29:38] bypized: @NeeK_23 The game has been on Early Access since 2018...
[3:29:57] bypized: @Lausten How about On Fence?
[3:30:11] NeeK_23: @bypized and?
[3:30:13] fooxytv: you wouldn't lose me.. play whatever you like
[3:30:15] TheCaselock: Kind of a weird take tbh...I watch streamers cause I like the streamer. Not just the game they play
[3:30:28] bypized: @NeeK_23 There is no overy hype LUL
[3:30:35] Harper_n7: sunk cost phalacy?
[3:30:35] Harai_Ulfsark: sunk cost?
[3:30:38] bojackhorseman2004: I think the nr1 best thing about recent wow is the mindset of "ever green" dragon flying, renown, new talent system etc all we are keeping
[3:30:42] bojackhorseman2004: and all works well
[3:30:44] Lausten: But its because I never invested any time in any other MMO than wow, I just dont care about MMOs, I care about WoW..
[3:30:47] BBMezzy: Zaralek Cavern, Challenge Races, 10.1.7 Dreamsurges and The Dripfed Tyr questline are some of the things I'd consider quantity over quality
[3:30:51] Harper_n7: sunk-cost fallacy
[3:30:56] Harper_n7: yeah I spelled it close enough lol

[3:41:55] thunduz: @MachoCham mrgmHehe

[3:42:16] Harper_n7: Speaking of jelly and jam, in Tali's stream yesterday he was talking about Jellied Eels
[3:42:19] thunduz: I think you need the heart
[3:42:40] SlithTheSivak: britains national dish
[3:42:40] Harper_n7: that was my response

[3:42:48] Phats66: its a london thing no?

[3:43:07] LuiBMHunter: eels n mash - yum!

[3:43:19] Harper_n7: he said black pudding and then said jellied eels
[3:43:27] BTakTTV: even as a japanese guy I wouldnt eat jellied eel lol
[3:43:28] LuiBMHunter: spotted dick for pud wiv custard ;)
[3:43:38] BTakTTV: black pudding is amazing

[3:43:43] CrowMomocle: you can get them in any big supermarket ~ jellied eels
[3:43:49] CrowMomocle: in a small jar
[3:43:58] SlithTheSivak: the OG place is called Manze's in London

[3:52:56] Jack_the_Dipper: Got my Lego yesterday (finally)
[3:53:04] Jack_the_Dipper: you doing BFA?
[3:53:24] ratgefingah: the drop rate been leaked
[3:53:29] ratgefingah: datamined
[3:53:31] Jack_the_Dipper: Yes
[3:53:37] MachoCham: I saw a disgusting fact from @NeeK_23 and it made me sad
[3:53:56] LuiBMHunter: 0%
[3:53:59] magemaster225: 15 heroic kills to guarentee, 7 mythic
[3:54:02] NeeK_23: the 15th kill one?
[3:54:14] MachoCham: Dropped it in DM
[3:54:16] magemaster225: thats post boost
[3:54:18] ratgefingah: ye thats the new one
[3:54:19] NeeK_23: thats the boosted
[3:54:24] Jack_the_Dipper: 15 hc Fyrakk kills?
[3:55:20] chelfx: its alot
[3:55:21] Lausten: I saw a funny screenshot of someone not getting it in the group and 15 people getting it LUL
[3:55:25] Jack_the_Dipper: 2%?
[3:55:26] Layliah79: i got mine 3 weeks ago. for my ret is was +16k ST
[3:55:26] NeeK_23: enough to want it
[3:55:37] Grissu_: on m+ is huge, on raid is decent
[3:55:49] chelfx: Even without the effect its a great stat stick due to the ilvl
[3:55:57] ratgefingah: on heroic 12 is 27%, 13 is 30%, 14 is 100%
[3:56:04] databob1: getting what?
[3:56:09] NeeK_23: Im raiding tonight, 17 people, 10 are pala/dk/warrior
[3:56:13] Layliah79: what's mad is before i got mine on my main, i'd seen ppl get them on multiple alts Dx
[3:56:32] MachoCham: Confirmed in chat Cham is allowed to raid
[3:56:33] Lausten: Half of reddit wow is just screenshots with orange text
[3:56:46] ratgefingah: so in 2 weeks everyone who killed hc fyrak every week and hasnt gotten it yet should get it
[3:57:37] Layliah79: I liked the way Wrath did theirs with Battered Hilt. I'd be down to just non-stop farm trash in a dungeon for it. At least we know it will eventually drop.
[3:57:45] NeeK_23: @MachoCham allowed to raid, never confirmed you'd make it to Fyrakk KEKW
[3:57:54] Elrathir: here comes the mount
[3:57:56] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 Sadge
[3:58:10] ZellieMoogle: Am about to go make dinner, but here to SEE THE MOUNT DROP, I BELIIIEEEEVE
[3:58:13] Grissu_: Quel"delar
[3:58:15] chelfx: Very cool sword
[3:58:30] nyrhalahotep: I want to believe
[3:58:47] Oswaldovzki: weird
[3:58:47] Elrathir: I lied
[3:58:49] Elrathir: my bad
[3:58:50] chelfx: Must be broken
[3:58:53] MachoCham: Didn't thoughts and prayers hard enough
[3:58:54] Oswaldovzki: must be a bug
[3:58:54] emmby_: Submit a ticket
[3:59:13] Layliah79: i wonder if the drop rate just "seems lower" because more of the population play 2h melee, then that did Evoker last tier.
[3:59:16] NeeK_23: its im Uldir
[3:59:34] chelfx: oh deer
[4:00:03] NeeK_23: you can do all the first bosses on mythic easy
[4:00:03] Phenroi: It's not the same room
[4:00:06] Layliah79: yes
[4:00:08] physalis4: yes
[4:00:12] dandiddydan: ghuun and mythrax are a pain on mythic
[4:00:13] Lausten: All but last boss
[4:00:31] ramzie0: Is ghuun even soloable on mythic?
[4:00:40] NIICKLAS_TV: mrgmHelloThere
[4:00:57] RazzeronTV: RazzeronTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Heyo!
[4:01:31] NIICKLAS_TV: yes, if adam got his passport sorted i was really considering it
[4:01:42] RazzeronTV: Yeah its a bit on and off, IRL and work is hectic atm
[4:01:45] NeeK_23: @ramzie0 there was one video of an giga arcane mage, but for most people no
[4:01:58] RazzeronTV: Hows the 100% completion going?
[4:02:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:02:18] bojackhorseman2004: 100% completion is gonna change so much with warbands
[4:02:29] bojackhorseman2004: is that comming in prepatch?
[4:02:33] bojackhorseman2004: harder?
[4:02:51] bojackhorseman2004: I wanna watch it :)
[4:03:03] losttobaldness: Any predictions on when the next expansion will release? I felt like it would be sooner, but since there is not even alpha info.. it might be november/december :(
[4:03:14] Oswaldovzki: Warbands is going to be amazing! I'm going to play some old toons that got exiled in other server
[4:03:17] chelfx: Sept
[4:03:20] Lausten: One thing I would love for them to sort out with Warbands would be professions, like be able to unlearn professions and swap professions and not lose recipes, maybe even make them account wide, so all your blacksmiths share recipes instead of being character specific..
[4:03:20] bojackhorseman2004: Cannoncly same room? or reused assets?
[4:03:22] ZellieMoogle: I need to sort some dinner..... or do I be cheeky and get a takeaway üëÄ
[4:03:29] Oswaldovzki: Pre patch on July?
[4:03:38] NIICKLAS_TV: we need that alpha soon
[4:03:40] Layliah79: they will make sure RWF won't happen during holidays again
[4:03:44] NIICKLAS_TV: need some new content
[4:04:24] Layliah79: @Lausten that's so good
[4:04:25] Oswaldovzki: Too good to be implemented XD
[4:04:33] ZellieMoogle: I love that little "you got a new transmog" jingle, collecting-related endorphins ftw LUL
[4:04:56] bojackhorseman2004: blizz are masters of "its different this time"
[4:04:58] RazzeronTV: Would have signed up for LFG London but I'm in America when its happening, Hope you all have a great time
[4:05:12] Layliah79: there's so much old content in this game they really need to make EVERYTHING account wide.
[4:05:14] ZellieMoogle: @RazzeronTV oo enjoy!
[4:05:19] bojackhorseman2004: if you watch interviews for pre shadowlands Ian is like "we learned, we didnt live up to the community blablabla"
[4:05:45] Lausten: I know Ion even said that he himself wont unlearn his professions cause hes got old removed recipes, so even he is aware of that "issue"
[4:05:58] RazzeronTV: Orlando, Meeting up with some friends I've met on twitch :)
[4:06:24] Jack_the_Dipper: Finally getting a accountwide bank
[4:06:28] Lausten: @Elkhuntsman With guilds being region wide and both factions it would be silly if they werent
[4:06:31] RazzeronTV: Heading to Miami too for a few days, Never flown before so theres that to look forward too LUL
[4:06:32] Layliah79: it's so satisfying solo'ing older raids.
[4:06:37] Jack_the_Dipper: yes
[4:06:39] ZellieMoogle: @Jack_the_Dipper yessss!
[4:06:50] NIICKLAS_TV: KEKW
[4:06:51] RazzeronTV: Yeah its gonna be intense

[4:07:14] Layliah79: @RazzeronTV love flying. taking off/landing is my fav parts!
[4:07:26] bojackhorseman2004: self imposed jetlag by gaming to hard is a thing
[4:07:28] RazzeronTV: The flight back is gonna be interesting
[4:07:41] RazzeronTV: 8pm flight back
[4:07:42] chelfx: my first flight was Vancouver to London UK
[4:07:47] RazzeronTV: arrive back 10am here
[4:07:56] MachoCham: Yeah perfect flight back
[4:08:00] ramzie0: I had terrible jetlag coming back to the US from Italy. I'd go to bed at like 8 and wake up at like 2am or 3am
[4:08:04] Layliah79: i'm to old to be degenerate anymore. i look forward to sleep now KEKW
[4:08:19] RazzeronTV: Yeah im pretty much living on the EST timezone as it is LUL

[4:08:56] MachoCham: @Demeternoth <3
[4:09:01] Layliah79: treated myself and bought a tempur-pedic bed that will go in zero gravity. so my bed is soo comfy
[4:09:10] Demeternoth: @MachoCham Hey knobhead :D
[4:09:16] RazzeronTV: Got myself a nice window seat, so theres that atleast
[4:09:47] Layliah79: always pick windows! best
[4:09:48] Demeternoth: He saved up Christmas money and then it dropped in price so his birthday money will go on something else
[4:09:53] Jack_the_Dipper: Finally, I had my Kick account deleted. that's not a simple thing
[4:09:54] RazzeronTV: Rather that then the back of a bald mans head LUL
[4:10:01] ramzie0: Flying from SF to Italy was awesome, we had a 5pm flight. Landed at 2pm in Frankfurt and Italy at 6. Stayed up till like 12am and was golden the rest of the trip
[4:10:14] sapphire_rosa_: HAI DEME!
[4:10:24] Demeternoth: oh hello lovely! @sapphire_rosa_ :D
[4:10:27] Demeternoth: lol
[4:10:30] MachoCham: Right Deme you're in charge, catch you later. Wallpapering to do before raid
[4:10:31] ramzie0: Oh, I slept the whole night portion of the flight
[4:10:33] NIICKLAS_TV: weirdChamp
[4:10:36] ramzie0: XD
[4:10:48] Demeternoth: @MachoCham noice
[4:11:00] Oswaldovzki: I'm flying to Europe this year, for holidays. First time flying to another country, across the ocean <3
[4:11:01] Demeternoth: OK guys, you heard it, I'm in charge. RIOT!!
[4:11:03] Layliah79: LOL!!

[4:12:12] Jack_the_Dipper: I like those new flights they
[4:12:33] Oswaldovzki: Totally! Another planet more likely! haha
[4:12:34] RazzeronTV: Just had a fun 24 hours, the sockets in my house had tripped yesterday but it wasnt a appliance it was the wiring. electrician couldnt arrive till this afternoon, went to log into wow yesterday then it happened, had to run to work to charge my phone last night KEKW
[4:12:36] Jack_the_Dipper: You know the flights with open doors
[4:12:44] Layliah79: don't die!
[4:12:51] bojackhorseman2004: I think it might be that stacking blood debuff
[4:13:08] henders21: Exhilirations back
[4:13:08] Layliah79: HEAL is up
[4:13:12] henders21: ah gg
[4:13:16] Layliah79: use a pet
[4:14:03] bojackhorseman2004: With the new delves and that you have a delve ally and scaling instanced, I wonder if they ever make old instances like this scalable and you can have AI allies like tanks and healers
[4:15:07] Lausten: I think there went a bit more into the AI for the dungeons than we expected
[4:15:15] Layliah79: think he might be similar to the ones we use in follower dungeons?
[4:15:17] onikid89: kinda hard calling bran smart ....
[4:15:55] bojackhorseman2004: Well, i think making old instances scale and give you an AI healer and tank is relatibly low cost high return investment
[4:16:42] bojackhorseman2004: relativly
[4:16:51] sapphire_rosa_: only if it‚Äôs an option/choice
[4:17:08] sapphire_rosa_: sometimes you just wanna bop through old content to do mount runs lol
[4:17:31] bojackhorseman2004: Yes, but I would love to solo Tom of sargares with an AI healer and Tank where it scales to an appropiate difficulty
[4:17:36] Phenroi: I actually love the raid finder Uldir set (without the helm of course)
[4:17:41] Lausten: I dont think the AI knows the dungeons, I think they need to be put on a path behind the scene, I tihnk it takes way more coding to make AI able to do dungeons than we expect
[4:18:04] sapphire_rosa_: agreed
[4:18:07] Layliah79: all expansion i could never get the manuscript to drop from Ruby Life Pools. I do one follower dungeon in there and BAM it dropped KEKW
[4:18:19] NeeK_23: not wanting to be an "uh Acktually" guy but its not AI, its scripted
[4:18:23] bojackhorseman2004: cant they just follow me and heal and take aggro?
[4:18:41] sapphire_rosa_: thank you @neek_23 I hate calling it AI
[4:19:08] Lausten: "Just slapping the AI on and then you can do AI dungeons" is NOT how it works
[4:19:20] bojackhorseman2004: I think them just acting sorta like pets would be fine just a bit smarter. So take aggro of things i attack or pull
[4:19:29] bojackhorseman2004: Dps pulling stuff for tank is pretty standard now in low keys anyway :)
[4:19:36] maplelost: do u think wow will come to consoles and xbox soon?
[4:19:54] NIICKLAS_TV: @maplelost probably not
[4:20:05] onikid89: like ff 14 .. on steam
[4:20:15] Lausten: Thats why I dont see them investing dev time into making old content Follower Dungeon compatible
[4:20:43] maplelost: isnt f2p limited to 20 to prevent bot abuse
[4:20:45] NeeK_23: trial to 60 is 100% the way to go
[4:20:48] Oswaldovzki: And the free to play experience of wow is incredible now, with chromie time. You can actually play all expansions on lvls 20
[4:20:57] NIICKLAS_TV: that would be huge
[4:21:54] Oswaldovzki: I would save some money for sure haha
[4:22:55] NIICKLAS_TV: id like to see classic go ftp too
[4:22:55] bojackhorseman2004: Most of those players are playing private servers
[4:23:00] bojackhorseman2004: I used to be a private server andy
[4:23:06] maplelost: roleplayers: "what expac"
[4:23:14] RazzeronTV: Alot of people just play PTR also and dont sub
[4:23:24] NIICKLAS_TV: true true
[4:23:43] NIICKLAS_TV: pepeLaugh
[4:23:53] Oswaldovzki: hahaha
[4:24:02] bojackhorseman2004: I played SL i been to hell :)
[4:24:06] Oswaldovzki: Come on, PTR is for testing, what do they expect?
[4:24:25] RazzeronTV: Remember that time you was speaking to someone who does and you asked him what he does when it happens he just said "I go again"
[4:24:46] bojackhorseman2004: omg! its like seasons in D4!
[4:24:52] bojackhorseman2004: and every new ptr you get somthing new
[4:24:58] bojackhorseman2004: 200IQ

[4:27:30] plopptart: I really thought we'd see a steady release of hero talent trees so feedback could be given before alpha
