[0:16:58] Rahuran: You‚Äôre a towel
[0:19:53] valianya: So, how about that D4 patch of doom?  Apparently the absurdly OP top builds by top players are still absurdly OP despite nerfs while the rest got flattened by the nerfs.
[0:20:20] Rahuran: Yeah they fixed the bug where some people still enjoyed D4
[0:20:33] Thoreya: doesnt sound like a good patch lol
[0:21:14] Rahuran: Doubly painful when you were looking forward to it

[0:31:30] herzlustafir: holy shit
[0:32:23] valianya: I watched YouTube vids of post nerf 100 uber lilith kills.  Bone spear necro nerfed about 50%, only difference was it took an extra minute or few to kill.  Tornado claw druid still doing nearly 60 million a hit.  Poison Rogue still ramping to kill on first platform.  Blizzard Sorc still hardly needing to move during fight, even if it took way longer than other classes.  And I cannot find a video of a Barb kill post nerfs.
[0:34:40] valianya: But a lot more people dying to random things in helltides because of the defensives nerfs, I guess

[0:41:57] valianya: Also, whoever is designing the new hearts and Aspects for Sorc seems to either be trying to get players to switch to other classes, or are on a different planet from the rest of the class designers, because the traits are just so bad in comparison to all other class specific new S1 things.

[0:46:22] valianya: The problem is its all nerfing the metas, and the baseline, but no buffs to lesser used abilities people actually wanted to be better to use other builds. The stuff that was buffed but nobody wanted is stuff you cannot really create a build around

[0:53:53] flookguy: Rogue one shotting shit in pvp
[0:54:02] Armdel: sorc were already weak and now everything got nerfed
[0:54:09] polaropposite76: my werenado druid so far feels almost the same.
[0:54:12] Sadisticmedic: Asmongold wasn't happy but he was going to play necromancer
[0:54:26] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 Literally have a guy on my bnet friendslist who I also follow on twitter. He's replied MULTIPLE times to Adam complaining about D4 and saying he quit, meanwhile he is online in game playing D4 for the next hours KEKW
[0:54:32] Latrudos: Druid is still pretty good just from that fact that they didn't get nerfed much.
[0:54:48] CanadianCataclysm: Blizzard released update on sorc in a video early this morning.. want to watch it?
[0:55:01] valianya: They wanted to force a slowdown in character progression and stop the boosting.  They also wanted to force the absurdly OP meta builds to fall back in line.  Except the nerfs hurt less used builds worse than the metas and didn't actually nerf the meta builds enough to get the top percentage of players to switch builds to diversify the statistics
[0:55:05] MellowMaximus: Take an L with POE 2 around the corner and potentially lose your player base to that franchise and then not return lol
[0:55:07] 91Niki: The nerf to druid was just to avoid the 1 trillion damage. People have been saying it doesn't effect anyone but the 1%
[0:55:32] TheGiant99: @towelliee I played my 87 barb last night and was able to still do the same content with zero issues

[0:56:58] ackdogg007: Ok I just finished my tree of whisper and it was 648k at 70
[0:57:08] Latrudos: The best thing they could probably do for build diversity is buff Overpower.
[0:57:11] akia03: Didnt hota get more nerfs thhat made it even worse
[0:57:28] dokor: @Towelliee it's a fucking ARPG, making crazy OP build that destroy everything in sight is pretty much why we play them

[0:57:37] headshot_hunter6: nothing else lol
[0:57:46] SpoofAvatar: the XP nerf and now having to be 70 to enter T4 is bad for the 50 to 70 grind
[0:57:48] TheGiant99: People just don't like nerfs.....and love over reacting to patches
[0:57:48] KuruxGaming: not very good tbh
[0:57:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: The tree is badass
[0:57:52] corjon1121: Hey haven‚Äôt played since season 1 wow df what is the gs cap at now for season 2
[0:58:09] Syllvn: Honeslty knowing my super casual folk I know who play WoW. Many people won't even read the notes and won't notice the difference.
[0:58:14] Kneckt: What's spicey about today? RareParrot
[0:58:20] Latrudos: Nightmare Dungeons are still pretty good for leveling.
[0:58:32] 91Niki: I think the issue with going into t4 earlier, is the people who get boosted and has zero business being in there, just dying over and over in group events
[0:58:38] Armdel: yeah i went through the capstone dungeon without dying at lvl 62
[0:58:49] 91Niki: I think that's who those restrictions are for
[0:59:03] Molvonos: Its gonna make the HC experience a solo affair.
[0:59:04] mavericks312: i dont get there hate for power leveling
[0:59:05] Shearkahn: I think they got pissy with how many people were getting boosted in HC for the trophies
[0:59:09] CatDumpZ: boosting in d3 was so OP
[0:59:09] 91Niki: I think it's due to a ladder coming for next seasons. That's what they don't want boosting for
[0:59:22] 91Niki: Which is fair
[0:59:23] Molvonos: Like Lore mentioned on Twitter last night, he's gonna leave Sloot behind if he dies to poison again
[0:59:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: For me it's only a problem when it comes to AFK boosting
[0:59:37] TheGiant99: @91niki you are 100% correct
[0:59:50] corjon1121: What‚Äôs the gs cap in wow season 2 now anyone know
[1:00:10] Armdel: gearscore?
[1:00:10] valianya: @towelliee I saw YouTube vids of bone spear necro, shrednado druid, Poison Rogue, and blizzard Sorc vs uber lilith post nerf.  They're still massively OP in the hands of top players, and hearts will make them stronger.  Couldn't find a post nerf Barb kill video
[1:00:14] NobodybetterPat: Gear score
[1:00:15] corjon1121: Gear score
[1:00:17] 91Niki: I personally don't think so. What is the point of HC if you can just boost your friends back to that level in a matter of hours when they die?
[1:00:22] corjon1121: Item level
[1:00:28] SonofHorus82: Gearscore?? This Wrath Classic?
[1:00:30] ackdogg007: I dont think boosting of friends was the issue I think it was the fact that you had people charging 200k plus gold or possibly real money to do it
[1:00:52] ackdogg007: sorry not 200k ment 200 mil
[1:00:58] TheGiant99: Yea people are still destroying Uber Lilith even after the patch
[1:01:00] corjon1121: No for dragon flight
[1:01:03] 91Niki: If I were playing HC and I died, KNOWING my friends could just easily boost me back to that level in a matter of hours and get me geared again. Dying wouldn't feel super punishing ijpSHRUG
[1:01:24] Affiiance: Morning hammer squad towHAMUP
[1:02:08] akia03: bliz wants to sell boost tokens in shop
[1:02:23] 91Niki: Oh I don't have problems with it either. People do them. But I understand it from the devs perspective and leaderboards

[1:03:04] rhodistar: Ima be the first to buy that token
[1:03:15] flookguy: I appreciate the wow boosting. For me it‚Äôs a math equation. 140k to go from 60-70 is like $10 of a wow token. But would take multi hours to do. It‚Äôs more value for my time to pay the $10 in gold on alts to do what I want to do
[1:03:49] Armdel: they'll follow wows example and make it $40

[1:14:33] Phoxzy: @Towelliee  Was looking to get the Darkstar mouse, can you give me an idea how easily the buttons on the side are to reach with your thumb?  It seems the front buttons would be require having to move your grip on the mouse
[1:15:13] Reubensandvich: Hey @Towelliee, I haven't played WoW beyond a week since 2009, until 3 weeks ago I've re-fallen in love with the game, though I've been avoiding dungeons and raids since I'm worried I'll get flamed. Any tips on how to not suck? :)
[1:15:18] wizkillifah: I'd love a hammer magnet for the fridge üòè
[1:15:28] 91Niki: Well @Towelliee do you have a palm or claw grip?
[1:16:10] 91Niki: So palm grip
[1:16:19] Deadelus0: How else would you hold a mouse?
[1:16:21] wizkillifah: Palm means you put your palm on the mouse
[1:16:22] flookguy: Love the quality of my scimitar but I‚Äôll be damned the thing disconnects mid dungeon at least once a day
[1:16:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: If your palm is on the mouse, it's a palm grip
[1:16:35] ArcaneMaki: claw grip is just the finger tips
[1:16:41] wizkillifah: Claw would be only fingers and sides of palm on the mouse
[1:16:45] abracka_: i know that FH +17 last night prob had you like that KEKW
[1:17:00] 91Niki: Yeah that can be mixed grip
[1:17:11] Strouss: i like the Glaive Pro. i dont use MMO mouse lol dumb old guy :P i just use shift and control modifers for keys binds.
[1:17:16] Eshel: ‚ÄúThe fingers you have used are too fat - please mash the keypad with your palm ‚Ä¶ now‚Äù
[1:17:29] 91Niki: But grip is also a huge factor to whether a mouse fits in your hands or not + the size of your hands and size of the mouse
[1:17:52] wizkillifah: What timezone does Towelie stream out of?

[2:13:41] warrenny: I think
[2:13:52] Zettabyte: @ZeTTaWaTTs KEKW
[2:14:04] pereadin: Why not a 20 T?
[2:14:20] cripplious: @91Niki I saw an article from amongold about how diablo 4 has problems and people claiming rage quit because Blizzard is ruining it
[2:14:34] Troggie: havent tried what? I played the patch today, its terrible so ill not wait until its good to try... maybe season 2 will be better
[2:14:37] Affiiance: Just spam 16/17s is the play
[2:14:49] peinen: @Towelliee do you think in season 3 it'll be the same, do 16s to get the max level vault rewards?
[2:14:49] 91Niki: @cripplious So you just blindly believe anyone on the internet instead of trying it for yourself? SeemsGood GG
[2:14:50] Zettabyte: Workin' on clearing all the fog of war areas in D4 RN
[2:14:54] George2001k: @towelliee any idea if the Crests for the upgrades will at some point be able to be sent to our alts?
[2:15:03] pereadin: Gotcha. I figured 20s were still necessary for vault üòÇ
[2:15:24] Theduskflyer: 20s are for portals and pushing. That‚Äôs it. 16s is where it‚Äôs at
[2:15:57] deaddwarfwalking: @Theduskflyer Agree
[2:16:03] cripplious: @91Niki Im on disability and only get $200 a month to pay rent and food. Video games are out unless they free
[2:16:16] Affiiance: I can actually play my alts this season
[2:16:36] zysmos: 20s were frustrating too hard for the average player and people leaving even when you stated it's a weekly
[2:16:39] 91Niki: @cripplious Okay? So why are you even looking at it to begin with if you only play free games ijpSHRUG
[2:17:00] pereadin: So what‚Äôs the new 447 system then if 20s are essentially obsolete?
[2:17:22] micherxd: !drops

[2:17:25] cripplious: @91Niki so i cant ask questions when people post stuff? Glad to meet the gatekeeper
[2:17:42] deaddwarfwalking: you can do a 16 to get a 441 and with 2 aspects crests you can upgrade to 447
[2:18:15] 91Niki: @cripplious I didn't say that LUL You are just arguing that a game is bad based off some random content creator off the internet, while saying you still don't play any games beyond free ones. Then it just becomes complaining just to complain
[2:18:24] Troggie: yes @cripplious  you sure can but you will get feedback like the mod provided you at times, should be able to handle it too
[2:18:35] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Heero_Effect (warning)
[2:18:39] Davedaman26: I wouldn't go by other peoples opinions about games if you haven't tried it. Like for me if the trailer is good I'm interested
[2:18:40] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:18:49] warrenny: @deaddwarfwalking Aspects 16+?
[2:19:00] cripplious: @91Niki I just asked if it was
[2:19:12] deaddwarfwalking: yeah you get 12 for time and 5 for untimed
[2:19:48] 91Niki: @Davedaman26 This is the way :D Other people's opinions can never be applied to your own. Watch a trailer and some gameplay and decide for yourself
[2:20:08] PotbellyGoat: we didn't 3 chest the legion event because we didn't kill mobs fast enough to spawn the 3rd boss lol
[2:20:20] Darwoo: whats everyone playing for new d4 season?
[2:20:30] Troggie: I went with my game play over last 12 hours, d4 is going in wrong direction hugely =/
[2:20:32] PastelDeNata69: Imagine consuming asmongold content... KEKW
[2:20:34] SonofHorus82: @cripplious you in the US? If you are then you are mos def receiving more than $200/mo disability (Disability Benefits is my job, so I know the minimums) If you're receiving Social Security. If you're not receiving SSDI and receiving Short-Term disability from your employer, then your employer is fucking you over.
[2:21:15] Davedaman26: @91Niki yep I've been doing that for years and it works for me if the trailer is good then I invest more into on reading up and finding more videos on gameplay like you mentioned.
[2:21:23] FutileDiploma: @towelliee man look at all those buffs rolling in top of screeb
[2:21:25] 91Niki: @Darwoo I might go Druid. I got my rogue to 100 from the launch. Think I might pick a new character every season to get everything to 100
[2:21:26] Rictamar: also $200 a month for rent AND food, yeh no that isn't getting you shit anywhere, this guy is capping
[2:21:27] FutileDiploma: Screen
[2:21:46] 91Niki: KEKW
[2:22:06] 91Niki: @Davedaman26 Basically. I always take peoples reviews and opinions with a grain of salt
[2:22:09] Arocian: Downed a world boss, several 3 chest legion events, only 1 mystery chest in helltide due to cinder increase (250), dungeons ran same / actually a little better on two builds that I have
[2:22:11] Troggie: 200 food a month, thats like a week for me =X
[2:22:18] rxdderz_: @Darwoo I;m the exact same LUL 100 rogue but cant decide if i should roll druid or not first!
[2:22:21] Maydie6066: @91Niki you would go back to druid lol, any game with a druid calls to you
[2:23:10] instant_savage: say waht now?
[2:23:16] instant_savage: weekly quest for what
[2:23:22] Cabbageman007: They changed it
[2:23:33] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 Actually no. I personally steered away from Druid in Diablo due to D2 druid. I hated it. Too many spells, not enough button room. Not the biggest fan of the D4 take on druid aka werewolf. But after watching some clan members play tornado druid, I got interested :p I like the speed of the build
[2:23:35] Rictamar: the time rift weekly
[2:23:39] Sereannon: They made the tokens boa. The quest is per account. Working as intended/s
[2:23:42] Rictamar: can only be done on one character
[2:23:49] Cabbageman007: The 1000 is now account wide mail option
[2:23:54] instant_savage: can u explain how to get the quest again
[2:24:07] Cabbageman007: So you can send too alt

[2:24:17] smokeydabandit509: @Towelliee did you see the new changes they featured on the Dev Hour podcast?
[2:24:17] Rictamar: the quest being per account is stupid, at least sending flakes between chars is there
[2:24:28] cripplious: @SonofHorus82 I recieve benefiits from my dad since I was disabled as a minor and SSA says I was over paid.
[2:24:29] 91Niki: @RxdderzTV If you like the gameplay speed of rogue, druid is a good option!
[2:24:32] boostedeg93: I tried it on my alt and the quest wasn't there on 2 that were lvl 61 and 65
[2:24:42] Davedaman26: @91Niki Oh yeah I'm the same way and for me I'm really picky on what games I like to play. Syfy, action, FPS, to name a few.
[2:24:50] 91Niki: @ti92ma He's going either barb or druid

[2:25:58] cripplious: @Rictamar I live in a group home. Its cheap but a roof and 3 hots
[2:26:10] Davedaman26: @91Niki LUL
[2:26:21] 91Niki: If anyone wanna try out rogue for s1, check out the shadow twisting blade build on wowhead. It's SUPER fun!! Unless you got wrist issues, then don't play it with mouse+keyboard LUL
[2:26:25] cyrex172: mornin everybody
[2:26:30] Maydie6066: @91Niki i couldnt get into that build, but it could have been because i was playing it on the PS5 and the controller was a new concept. i 100% got spoiled by the rogues fast attacks my necro feels like it takes years to use basic abilities lol
[2:27:33] Sereannon: I had to go controller after launch week. I still need CT surgery on my other hand.

[2:28:52] Trekytv: The shirts look hella good and nice quality
[2:28:56] Davedaman26: @Towelliee got any more idea for new shirts in the future?
[2:29:57] warrenny: Some kinda thon
[2:30:04] mavericks312: so disney is about to be for sale
[2:30:24] smashwow: what?
[2:30:24] Finansdepartementet: The MoP shirts were dopest ones for sure
[2:30:27] Davedaman26: Ah ok since I'm collecting those limited edition them shirts I have one from DF and D4
[2:30:32] Jarlan23: ?? disney
[2:30:38] 91Niki: @mavericks312 wut?
[2:30:42] Jarlan23: who would disney even sell to
[2:31:07] smashwow: @Jarlan23 elon Kappa
[2:31:17] cripplious: @Jarlan23 I heard Apple
[2:31:30] mavericks312: @91Niki bob iger hinted at it yesterday with the streaming service losing like close to 800 mil
[2:31:42] cripplious: @smashwow Elon has his hands full already with trying to recoup his twitter invest
[2:31:45] mavericks312: @91Niki apple is the company as of now rumored to buy it
[2:31:55] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Well, DisneyPlus doesn't have enough content to sustain subs. It just doesn't
[2:32:09] cripplious: @mavericks312 that was in India because they lost he Cricket rights
[2:32:16] Maydie6066: it also doesnt have the best of stuff coming out either
[2:32:27] mavericks312: @91Niki streaming services as a whole have been losing money
[2:32:33] Maydie6066: Marvel is flopping its stuff
[2:32:39] cyrex172: it feels like I took a beating from yesterdays nerfs but im still super hyped for season 20
[2:32:41] cyrex172: 1
[2:32:44] cyrex172: season 1
[2:32:46] cyrex172: i need coffee
[2:32:55] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Oh I believe it. Nobody wants to sub to 10 different streaming services to watch everything. So they unsub and pirate instead.
[2:32:59] mavericks312: @Maydie6066 i mean the starwars stuff is trash as well
[2:33:05] Jarlan23: except when u get that charge one
[2:33:07] Jarlan23: what a pain
[2:33:07] dalgress: damn
[2:33:11] warrenny: Thats new
[2:33:52] mavericks312: @91Niki but there are 2 reports one says seling the company the other says just the streaming side of things
[2:34:13] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Like just imagine if all the companies would agree, throw up one giant streaming service site, put all and everything on and split the money earned. They would make BIG BUCKS.
[2:34:18] Flippyyz: ez key. hpal nerf is 8% nerf to overhealing lmao
[2:34:25] Maydie6066: @mavericks312 it is, I loved season 1 of Mando, but 2/3 fell short, didnt even care for the Book of Boba, and Obi Wan was nice but it felt very hesitant to change shit. Star Wars needs to stop trying to cram shit in between episode of 4/5 and branch out into new areas of the galaxy
[2:34:43] Flippyyz: honestly
[2:34:50] Flippyyz: i think its the kit they have since the rework
[2:34:56] Rocman: you shut you mouth Tman
[2:35:01] Flippyyz: a lot more aoe healing outside of AC
[2:35:09] Maydie6066: @91Niki MAX is getting close to that, it carries a lot of stuff from different properties (Fox, Disney, marvel, HBO, Universal, etc)
[2:35:11] cyrex172: @Maydie6066 yeah season 1 of mando was amazing, everything disney made after that was kinda meh for me
[2:35:12] Rocman: Holy is perfect
[2:35:26] mavericks312: but if apple were to try and buy disney im sure the FTC would love to show how dumb they are again
[2:35:42] zysmos: I have the buff never expiring so i get a reward every single run right now lol

[2:35:58] Darwoo: memes on d4 are so funny man
[2:36:07] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 The issue is, it is also region based. Like there ain't the same stuff on it in Denmark as there is in the US. That is also a huge part of the problem
[2:36:07] cyrex172: @mavericks312 ive accepted that star wars is dead to me and moved on
[2:36:12] Flippyyz: like rdruid in bfa, just the best 5 man healer

[2:39:18] 91Niki: I used to be subbed to Netflix non stop. But with the password sharing bullshit fucking over people like me who spend 6 months of the year at my boyfriends place in the US. Now they can F off
[2:39:20] cyrex172: --i cut cable awhile ago

[2:39:57] ashwing_: HotS revival by MS Prayge
[2:40:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: there are ... places you can watch all the streaming services content for free not that i know anything about that...

[2:40:25] herzlustafir: HoS for consols.. yes pls
[2:40:33] herzlustafir: nintendo that sjit
[2:40:34] Shrenko: HotS is a really fun game too bad it didnt catch enough moba players
[2:40:37] cyrex172: i would be so hype for hots revival
[2:40:53] Sereannon: Starcraft team quit to start their own company, didn't they?
[2:41:04] Shrenko: they did allready kinda do a HotS revival but it failed too
[2:41:04] PastelDeNata69: HoTS is much more fun and "better" than LoL. Change my mind.
[2:41:11] ashwing_: They released it too late in the MOBA genre
[2:41:21] Havoc_S1: That would be a cool mobile console port
[2:41:29] NickLeonhearth: dota is just better :D more complex, more possibilities
[2:41:43] mavericks312: HoTs isnt competing with league
[2:41:57] Molvonos: They fucked themselves over when they didn't snatch up DOTA, and HoTS kinda sucks compared to it
[2:42:02] Snabido: @NickLeonhearth Complexity=better CoolCat
[2:42:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: the toxicness of LoL turned me against all MOBA
[2:42:08] Molvonos: They could have made bank with DOTA.
[2:42:13] FlyingSquash: What channel in disc has the giveaway?
[2:42:16] NickLeonhearth: @Snabido
[2:42:20] warrenny: Looks like a moba plays like a moba is a moba
[2:42:27] NickLeonhearth: @Snabido more possibilities for build = better
[2:42:28] Nerendis: @Molvonos HoTS was fun, but it was always just a step behind DOTA or League

[2:42:56] Shrenko: HotS is a moba for casuals
[2:42:58] Shrenko: and I loved it
[2:43:05] Jarlan23: they really told people to play a different game
[2:43:07] Jarlan23: ?
[2:43:10] 91Niki: I only played HotS for the wow mount KEKW
[2:43:22] herzlustafir: it has stod still for a while now? when did they release the last character? must have been years by now
[2:43:37] NickLeonhearth: @91Niki I regret not getting that mount :(
[2:43:40] cyrex172: i hate having to play league for my moba fix....

[2:44:47] herzlustafir: not like them to let it crash like that they usualy want to get out on top on there stuff
[2:44:50] Molvonos: More like every year too late.  I still cant fathom their hubris for not taking Icefrog up on DOTA
[2:45:10] Kinghorn: blizzard hubris
[2:45:12] CoolioDoom: yeeted out of the portal again... fml.

[2:46:47] warrenny: Gryphon for both factions?
[2:46:59] Raidr211: havent been able to catch any of the rifts yet....
[2:46:59] FutileDiploma: Any other class similar to prot pally as tank it is so fun but with casual expansion the gear grind being pretty easy Loking for similar class to level
[2:47:15] Jarlan23: blizzard is laying off more esports staff now too
[2:47:24] Jarlan23: looks like overwatch league is gonna be done with soon
[2:47:38] 91Niki: So are time rifts a limited time thing or no ?
[2:47:41] Nerendis: @Jarlan23 That was announced last year
[2:47:52] warrenny: @jarlan23 Despicable
[2:47:56] Jarlan23: theres more today
[2:47:59] Shrenko: @91Niki no, its new content in 10.0.5
[2:48:06] Nerendis: Yikes

[2:48:19] 91Niki: @Shrenko Yeah I know that much, but wasn't sure if it was something that would go away
[2:48:41] SlumTog: Should i play wow again?
[2:48:53] pereadin: sure
[2:48:56] AzoreanLegend: @SlumTog Nop
[2:49:08] Nerendis: @Shrenko Usually major patch points like this don't go away
[2:49:26] 91Niki: @Nerendis Yeah true. I am just not up to date with wow, so wasn't sure :p
[2:49:30] Jarlan23: yeah but theyre doing a vote on  a new operating agreement now too. teams can vote to continue but if they dont theres a 6 mill cancel fee
[2:49:38] Jarlan23: so it sounds like its done
[2:49:58] Nerendis: @91Niki Fair fair. Be aware that as time goes on, less people will be doing it. Theoretically making it harder to grind your mounts/tmog etc.
[2:49:58] PigPenLen: formula works
[2:50:11] mavericks312: careful now the try hards will tell you DF is a dead xpac and is killing wow
[2:50:13] 91Niki: @Nerendis Yeah
[2:50:21] Nerendis: 6m cancel fee is fucking nothing. They are all gonna leave.
[2:50:34] Jarlan23: theyre doing a vote on whether they wanna continue or not and yeah

[2:52:09] Jarlan23: yeah
[2:52:10] herzlustafir: just make it for all consoles and keep adding characters.. 100 characters.. ppl gonna play that shit all the free game on PS or nintendo.. or just keep it on PC.. i mean laptop players could still like some updates on HoS.
[2:52:18] NickLeonhearth: I feel physically sick, that bingo was all that's wrong in the world in 1 place @Towelliee
[2:52:21] cyrex172: lol
[2:52:29] Kinghorn: 0% shot
[2:52:31] Nerendis: He's saying their buyout clause is going to be 6m. Which is dirt cheap.
[2:52:32] mavericks312: OW league is dead lol
[2:52:57] zeiours: Do people still play overwatch
[2:53:00] Calphurnious: krippRIP

[2:53:22] Jarlan23: it could be long though
[2:53:31] shortyforthewin: anyone know if the gold in diablo4 will go over too season play
[2:53:37] Nerendis: Typically the franchisee will have to pay the league
[2:53:48] Calphurnious: @shortyforthewin LUL
[2:53:48] Incredible_Sausage: @shortyforthewin lol no
[2:53:52] Heero_Effect: VoHiYo
[2:53:53] Nerendis: You sell your spot back to the league
[2:53:57] Rictamar: wait, the OW teams signed a contract to enter the league that if they want to leave they have to pay? WTF
[2:53:58] Jarlan23: "the teams will vote on an updated operating agreement. If the teams do not vote to continue under an updated operating agreement, a termination fee of $6 million will be payable to each participating team entity"
[2:54:03] Jarlan23: is exactly what it says
[2:54:03] Rictamar: just let the league die naturally KEKW
[2:54:04] Nerendis: Most leagues own the slots, and sell them to organizations.

[2:55:33] Rictamar: esports is dying across the board, its time they cut their losses and get out

[2:55:55] PastelDeNata69: Imagine being one, if not THE, company that nearly everybody grew up with and now they shit the bed 24/7
[2:55:57] Nerendis: Blizzard is exceptionally bad at esports. StarCraft Broodwar is doing better than almost every other game.
[2:55:58] Heero_Effect: Broodwar
[2:56:04] Kinghorn: early hearthstone was decent
[2:56:11] xziyn: They actually went back to SC: Brood War in Korea instead of playing SC2 lol @Towelliee
[2:56:19] cipusanx: maybe their pvp is not that good
[2:56:41] Nerendis: As someone that has worked in blizzard games esports for years. Blizzard is super heavy handed, wants all their guys in, and refuses to work with tier 2 and tier 3 seeding tournaments.
[2:56:51] Kinghorn: wow pvp KEKW
[2:56:51] Incredible_Sausage: StarCraft 3 coming out soon then LUL
[2:56:56] Thoreya: im happy to watch the great push this weekend :)
[2:57:05] zysmos: franchises are stupid for esport imo it's way too small
[2:57:46] Nerendis: Esports is a money losing marketing tool. Blizzard seems to think it makes money.
[2:58:00] Darwoo: see that video of soemone killing uber lilith after bone spear nerf? lol
[2:58:02] Rictamar: ^^^ this
[2:58:04] mavericks312: blizz owned esports shit dies so fast
[2:58:24] herzlustafir: HoS is already there its. like dust it off and put a cord in that bitch
[2:58:27] Nerendis: Wanna make money from esports? Don't. Make money from skin sales that your esports promotes.
[2:58:28] Thoreya: bc esports aint profitable unless ur league or csgo
[2:58:45] Rictamar: take it from Max, who is part owner of Liquid, eSports is in a hard decline, the capital and investment isn't there anymore
[2:58:48] Incredible_Sausage: @notle Clap
[2:58:54] Nerendis: @Thoreya Neither league or csgo are that profitable tbh

[2:59:15] Thoreya: @Nerendis thats when u know LUL
[2:59:41] Notle81: i'm here

[3:17:40] abracka_: callback, "pull the ripcord!"
[3:17:41] D3mitr1: Are the changes that bad?
[3:17:42] tonyr23: The xp nerf is what is getting to me the most

[3:18:47] Eshel: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll take what we give you cause we about to get that Microsoft money !!!‚Äù Lmao
[3:18:48] Red_Dead_Redeem: well the casuals aren't going to like the xp nerf and not being able to be carried into level 50 etc, plus they can't buy uber boss run

[3:19:10] FullmetalD: they could squish but find a middle ground not squish into the ground
[3:19:37] Diesel1975: Casuals don't care about getting carried to level 50. They just want to explore and experience the quests/story.
[3:19:37] Arocian: casual aren't using grp xp boosting, carries for boosting
[3:19:41] Thoreya: blizz devs =/= blizz consumers
[3:19:47] Thoreya: never on the same foot lol
[3:19:56] azurrei: I'm going in with an open mind , if it is not fun I'll wait for S2 - definitely not using my battlepass unlock will hold it
[3:20:04] Shadowmakii: NAH!! the game is dead there is no motivation to play for 4 items
[3:20:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: I solo HC to level 100 on sorc, so I am good...I consider myself a massive casual, but I do enjoy grinding and playing games of that sort. Hence I play POE, Wow, Diablo4 now LUL
[3:20:28] DoryuKa: Yeah I think it's funny them squishing, what's the point if you just keep squishing? I remember them squishing because people had like 1 million life and we're basically back to that again.
[3:20:40] Arocian: we have but I see lots of casuals who haven't unlocked the map or all liliths yet, after 7 weeks
[3:20:52] cyrex172: thats not realistic anymore i think
[3:20:52] cornsbakedgoods: a week of 200 hrs played KEKW
[3:21:02] zeiours: Activ/blizzard deal delayed to October
[3:21:06] feagans: yeah, just let me level and play.. to get to end game and then it can be a grind
[3:21:10] Red_Dead_Redeem: what's twitter?
[3:21:16] CptReymious: @Arocian thats why they r casuals
[3:21:19] tonyr23: Itll take casuals a month mayb to hit 80....
[3:21:19] c0mmander_starscream: I never see those people are the bars
[3:21:23] Mecabeast: I stopped at lvl62 personally
[3:21:40] CptReymious: @Mecabeast same
[3:21:51] Exxcar: yo yo
[3:22:02] Red_Dead_Redeem: idk man I went to the bar and some guy was crying into his whiskey about no sorc love in the new patch notes Kappa
[3:22:21] cyrex172: i think people are acting too dramatically as its only a month into the games release
[3:22:37] cyrex172: im going to play the shit out of season 1
[3:23:02] geokouts: they saw the gazzilion dmg that was done and thought to do something
[3:23:03] Molvonos: I tried to get in, but it was like 'nope
[3:23:14] PigPenLen: thats the metrics I am interested in, hopefully they share that
[3:23:43] Red_Dead_Redeem: they want people to stay on the game playing, hence making them money.....but it's going to be a grind. I would love to finish the content and get to level 100 in two weeks max, but doubt it'll happen for some reason
[3:24:06] FullmetalD: imo make an ideal lvling experience the first time around and for alt boost the xp so its not so grindy
[3:24:29] Arocian: the numbers that will really matter are $'s on battle pass and tmogs, if they lose the ppl that are dropping bills then they will adjust

[3:25:21] PigPenLen: no i don't mean literally, Blizz doesn't want the store to be in the conversation
[3:25:33] Red_Dead_Redeem: I did like the hell mount armor thing in the shop, it looked sick
[3:25:37] Haegemon: I'm happy D4 shop isn't super dense with stuff. Means the in-game drops can still look cool and not just "pay to look cool or else", and if I'm gonna toss them 10-20 bucks every few months, would rather that be for a battlepass.

[3:26:14] dracullus: for me battlepass is fair, shop is too greedy if there is no way to get this in game
[3:26:24] Doqx42: D4 shop slow release keeps more people paying I'm sure by never feeling like you can't keep up
[3:26:35] Syllvn: As long as there is a good mix it's fine. PoE is a perfect example where literally nothing is good inside the game xD
[3:26:56] FullmetalD: clown transmog cuz some of the people on the d4 are for sure clowns
[3:26:56] cazhually: Bdg probably done in rwf
[3:26:58] Thoreya: @Red_Dead_Redeem tbf u get access to 3 games with that sub
[3:27:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: @Thoreya yeah for sure, it's worth it to me, but some feel different
[3:27:55] TheGiant99: Even with the changes D4 is still a real fun game to play. Can't wait for tomorrow to start a season toon and start to FUN journey

[3:28:42] Nerendis: Yeah but your healers can't break 50k HPS
[3:29:45] Red_Dead_Redeem: damn why does IRL shit have to interfere with my gaming? LUL
[3:29:57] 1llum1n471: If they're done, then Liquid is about to go recruiting. Lol

[3:32:32] Nerendis: So for farming purposes. If a raid boss drops a mount on all difficulties. Can you run it 3 times a week for a mount chance? I'm not a master farmer like you.
[3:32:36] Jarlan23: muscle memory is a bitch
[3:33:08] Darwoo: hows it cost so much? salary?
[3:33:08] Nerendis: So Golden Guardians had their funding MASSIVELY cut because of Covid. They can barely afford their League of Legends franchise spot RN.
[3:33:54] PigPenLen: its all a house of cards
[3:34:14] FullmetalD: @Nerendis apparently alot of league teams are having issues with funding its pretty costly
[3:34:18] Nerendis: Yeah, especially since GSW are actually pretty into it. But they can't help like they want. Golden Guardians has a budget team and is actually 2nd place in the regular season.
[3:34:40] mrniceguy817: Idk have you seen the Team Liquid CSGO team lul jk but really
[3:34:43] Darwoo: there isn't prize money for winning race to world first is tthere?
[3:34:45] Nerendis: @Nerendis Oh, not apparently. This is the truth. It's very costly and returns have been dropping year over year.
[3:35:24] cornsbakedgoods: prize money is the subs and views they get for it
[3:35:26] FullmetalD: @Nerendis I only found out very recently it's wild
[3:35:56] Nerendis: Chinese esports is WILD bro. You have no idea how much money they have.
[3:36:02] cornsbakedgoods: didnt peices just last the one race they lost?
[3:36:26] Heero_Effect: towHesaidit
[3:36:49] c0mmander_starscream: they get that back in tax write offs
[3:37:26] xziyn: Or by rich kids
[3:37:36] Knocx: i mean south korea teams have samsung as a backer
[3:37:49] Nerendis: I've seen Chinese League individual player contracts at nearly 10mil a year. That's like the operating cost of Liquid Guild - for one player rofl.
[3:38:06] PigPenLen: @c0mmander_starscream that is not how that works bud
[3:38:22] xziyn: @Knocx They don't anymore, and even when they did, it was a TINY fraction of Samsung's budget
[3:38:42] Nerendis: Typical esports contracts are 1-3 years. A big team like this would be more like 2-3. Steve (owner of Liquid) seems fairly into WoW, he diversifies a LOT.

[3:39:26] Nerendis: If you don't know Liquid Steve memes, it's basically just throw money at every problem.
[3:39:30] Rictamar: yeh like losing 3 in a row for sure had an affect
[3:39:35] nocturnal_2195: Max is a Co owner of Liquid as well though so that could affect them in a good way
[3:39:44] Rictamar: if it turned out to be 4, oh boy they probs would've been seriously looked at
[3:39:46] Nerendis: The current League roster is just money balling World Champions and hoping it works

[3:40:26] Molvonos: Hammer Squad Geriatric Gamer House when
[3:40:58] Nerendis: He is not a co-owner of all of Liquid. It's probably in his contract, and can be sold off/bought out easily. Not that I'm rooting for Liquid to drop the guild.

[3:41:33] nocturnal_2195: @insanity2195 idk i just looked up ownership of liquid esports and it shows a list of names and Max was one
[3:41:45] Nerendis: Steve and Nazgul are the Co-Owners of Liquid. The organization.
[3:41:48] omnomcake: Max is a co owner of the org
[3:41:52] Nerendis: They also have a board
[3:41:53] Thoreya: max can be a co owner and also own just like 1% of liquid lol
[3:41:53] Heero_Effect: Getting anime adds lol
[3:42:24] Nerendis: You can own stocks and call yourself a co-owner.
[3:42:26] zeiours: It's 1-1 to liquid and echo this xpac right?
[3:42:26] PigPenLen: his role is GM primarily
[3:43:01] Heero_Effect: Meh I‚Äôll buy liquid so they can carry me in WoW
[3:43:09] Nerendis: Right, it's the board -> Steve + Nazgul -> general managers.
[3:43:16] Exxcar: Don't think we will get a 10.3?
[3:43:32] FullmetalD: mega raid 20 bosses no nerfs
[3:43:45] Thoreya: i dont want DF to end :(
[3:43:48] SlideCancelXDD: So is season patch 1 THAT bad for D4 or are people just being dramatic as per usual?

[3:44:08] Exxcar: You think we are getting xpac announcement at Blizzcon?
[3:44:12] Exxcar: I'm expecting it
[3:44:23] ashwing_: going by world tree 10.2 then there is potential for 10.3
[3:44:23] Nerendis: @Exxcar 100%
[3:44:25] SlideCancelXDD: I feel like Dragonflight JUST came out haha
[3:44:37] FullmetalD: nah 20 boss raid so the race goes on for more than like 2-3 weeks
[3:44:38] Molvonos: I really wish they'd have reused the Dinar system.
[3:44:47] Exxcar: @SlicexDH Time flies when you're having fun haha. I feel the same
[3:44:53] PigPenLen: I have heard a .5 patch referred to, anyone know what that is?
[3:45:01] Heero_Effect: towHesaidit
[3:45:46] Exxcar: @PigPenLen We  are on 10.1.5 currently maybe?
[3:46:02] SlideCancelXDD: are we thinking there is potentially no 10.3?
[3:46:30] Jarlan23: anyone got a picture of that roadmap they showed
[3:47:07] Nerendis: That's after blizzcon homie. You started on Nov 14.
[3:47:12] SlideCancelXDD: mid jan 10.2.5
[3:47:16] Exxcar: Blizzcon is first weekend of November right?

[3:48:55] SlideCancelXDD: What if testing starts June

[3:49:18] AlphasaurusRexx: this is if they dont do the s4 SL treatment
[3:49:21] PigPenLen: yeah it does
[3:49:23] SlideCancelXDD: that would be the shortest no?
[3:49:26] Exxcar: Honestly they need to keep the momentum of DF going
[3:49:37] Exxcar: I'm expecting a fast next expansion
[3:49:43] JPBMDC: we are going underwater for 11.0
[3:49:43] Moobot: New D4 Twitch Prime Loot- Brackish Fetch Mount Armor Bundle https://shorturl.at/agACX
[3:49:45] Thoreya: think itll be another nov release
[3:50:03] xziyn: No chance of 10.2 in October you reckon?
[3:50:05] SlideCancelXDD: Wow okay so DF will be the shortest expansion of WoW's history - kinda bittersweet tbh
[3:50:34] Exxcar: I mean 10.1.7 doesn't have much conent to be honest
[3:51:01] Yagr6: when is next raid ?
[3:51:03] Nerendis: Too long
[3:51:12] xziyn: 10.1.7 first week of september and 0.2 3rd week of october, still like a solid 6 weeks
[3:51:16] reggiepowa: there was a new zone in 10.0.7 to be fair
[3:51:18] brewgamingtv: 10.2 comes out before october
[3:51:36] mavericks312: he said before october
[3:51:40] brewgamingtv: well they reworked brewfest
[3:51:49] Exxcar: 10.0.7 was March 21, 2023
[3:51:53] reggiepowa: if 10.1.7 comes out next month 10.2 could come out late september early october
[3:51:53] SlideCancelXDD: I hope they change up the next raid visually a lot
[3:51:55] mavericks312: the only way 10.2 is before october is if 10.1.7 is in august
[3:51:58] hammack52: i think the big thing people are missing is that most likely there will be a 10.3 but it might not have a new raid, just story and filler content
[3:51:59] EarlofCockwood: whats the differnce to shadowlands?
[3:52:13] Heero_Effect: Assmongold

[3:53:43] Nerendis: I was betting Oct 24 tbh
[3:53:49] Exxcar: I think you had november up when you said that which is what confused us haha
[3:54:07] happyspot: yeah bc 10.1.7 has to come out before brewfest at least
[3:54:20] TweektheProphet: it makes sense because i feel bliz would want the RWF folks to have a chance to be at blizcon
[3:54:21] Nerendis: It'll be another 8-9 day race I think
[3:54:35] Exxcar: While expensive, I'm looking forward to an in person Blizzcon again

[3:55:23] Moobot: Happy to announce we are now sponsored towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee | Currently using the K100 RGB Optical Keybord/Scimitar RGB Elite MMO Mouse/HS80 RBG Wireless Headset/MM700 3XL RGB MAT!
[3:55:24] Nerendis: They don't even want fans there rofl.
[3:55:34] Snabido: What, all of it?
[3:55:36] Heero_Effect: Hot take Shadowlands was underrated
[3:55:38] Shadowmakii: BIG BAND?
[3:55:41] Exxcar: Blizzcon is also a different format entirely, Only one stage it seems (in the Arena)
[3:55:42] Nerendis: Oh yeah. I've been pirating blizzcon for 20 years and bam, free?
[3:55:48] Eshel: Wouldn‚Äôt it be neat to have a RWF invitational in person at Blizzcon ?
[3:55:49] TheR3dBull: All Microsoft events are free to watch ;)
[3:56:20] Nerendis: @Eshel They've done this before. Race to complete and already finished tier.
[3:56:28] Exxcar: They also wouldn't release a raid Blizzcon week. NEVER
[3:56:40] Eshel: Just pipe dreaming scenario lol
[3:56:42] Exxcar: They want their staff to enjoy the week/work the week as well
[3:56:42] Heero_Effect: Lol what?
[3:56:48] Affiiance: They only have one stage for panels this year
[3:57:03] Nerendis: I distinctly remember SK Gaming vs. Nihilum racing Sunwell Plateu a few months before wotlk release.

[3:57:04] TweektheProphet: do you think they will have a twitch drop for blizcon
[3:57:21] Eshel: They‚Äôre really just shooting themselves in the foot with the timing - especially with the prices this year
[3:58:17] Exxcar: @Eshel slootWut Blizzcon has always been first week of November
[3:58:17] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:58:36] Thoreya: its the prices more than anything
[3:58:41] Eshel: As long as Blizzcon doesn‚Äôt become as cheesy as the DCEU con thing they do smfh
[3:58:45] hammack52: the more i hear of this the more it feals like this is one of blizzes thing that they want something to fail so they can justify not having to do something like hold a live blizz con anymore
[3:59:16] Thoreya: hotel/flight/tickets its a lot
[3:59:30] Eshel: @exxcar I mean with the patch releases - they knew when the con would be and could‚Äôve timed better
[3:59:37] Jewishraver: You going to twitchcon @towelliee ?
[3:59:37] hammack52: i said a LIVE blizz con
[3:59:43] SirMaldo: but they about to get that microsoft money lol
[3:59:44] Phil87z: I feel like the vibe is going to be so different at this blizzcon. So many people are gone from the community
[3:59:55] Arocian: it'd be interesting to see how many tickets they sell overall
[3:59:56] Nerendis: @hammack52  towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil
[3:59:57] Syllvn: It's like PAX and the rest, the first after such a big break is more reserved.
[3:59:58] PigPenLen: no this is a PR move most likely to steer away from a party house type of appearance
[4:00:03] Exxcar: ??? We don't have official patch days yet, an to be honest, they don't plan one based on the other
[4:00:36] Eshel: The virtual Blizzcon felt - forced (for lack of a better word)
[4:00:43] Exxcar: Blizzcon has always and will probably always be first week of Nov (due to contracts like Toweliee said) but they aren't going to modify patch releases for Blizzcon
[4:00:46] Arocian: pretty cool that they're letting it be streamed for free, good promotional
[4:01:16] Exxcar: If anything, we could get an "extra" patch because of things they announce at the con
[4:01:21] byrdeen45: next microsoft con
[4:01:36] Arocian: no doubt, if they put some kind of sub drops out, watch drops, content creators will get to eat
[4:01:37] Heero_Effect: But all they make is WoW towHesaidit
[4:01:45] Exxcar: @Towelliee For me its another excuse to meet up with my friend who lives in the area :D
[4:01:57] SlideCancelXDD: for them its go and spend lots of money or stay home and make lots of money
[4:02:01] SlideCancelXDD: easy equation imo
[4:02:02] Haegemon: Blizzard also wouldn't put a patch out right at Blizzcon because of how many of their QA staff they leverage as event-staff for Blizzcon itself. they wouldn't drop something when there won't be enough staff around to fix the problems right then/there.
[4:02:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: didnt have a car payment last time i went to blizzcon, not a chance of that right now
[4:02:39] Arocian: Blizzcon for me has always been a good excuse to meet up with folks, catch some blizzcon, hit disney, etc.. make a vacay out of the trip
[4:02:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: didnt they have an expansion launch like a week after blizzcon
[4:03:25] Shadowmakii: this year will be the survival game announcement
[4:03:26] Exxcar: Blizzcon is also a year round planning thing
[4:03:36] Heero_Effect: @arocian you can do it anyway without WoW Getcamped
[4:03:43] Exxcar: Like Blizzcon 2023 will end, and they immedeatly will start planning for Blizzcon 2024
[4:04:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: Roscos chicken and waffles was the best thing about going to blizzcon
[4:04:09] Eshel: I‚Äôm saying patches could be timed better around Blizzcon though - for all their games - not smart way to maximize profits by tempting a whole base to just stay home
[4:04:43] AlphasaurusRexx: @Towelliee they could do a S4 SLands treatment for DF and not have to worry about patch and blizzcon patch overlap
[4:04:54] Thoreya: yeah
[4:04:58] Thoreya: very true
[4:04:58] Eshel: It‚Äôll be fine and maybe this will turn out a way to ramp up from virtual back to live
[4:05:02] Thoreya: free advertisement
[4:05:06] Eshel: Fair enough
[4:05:09] SlideCancelXDD: True
[4:05:30] DoughBoi_Trev: 500 to 800k EZ
[4:05:56] SlideCancelXDD: Man, im not gonna lie, outside of your stream, I feel like WoW's section has been mainly Classic WoW for well over 2 years now
[4:05:59] instant_savage: Like if they gice aways the blizzcon polar bear feom way back...views would be insane
[4:06:01] Eshel: My greedy ass thinks that with ticket prices (especially this years cost) I‚Äôd want people standing on the roof if I had to lol
[4:06:15] aztech88: Not my proudest tug
[4:06:36] SlideCancelXDD: Well conventions in general are dying it in gaming
[4:06:45] Arocian: lol

[4:07:15] Heero_Effect: I mean E3 didn‚Äôt happen come on y‚Äôall it‚Äôs changing times.
[4:07:32] Eshel: This trash - two words - ‚Äúfuck timerips‚Äù
[4:07:55] Haegemon: E3 had been dying well before covid
[4:07:59] pirlivewire: when that mob truns gold it put a debuff on you that take 100% armor off you for 3 sec
[4:08:02] Eshel: @heero_effect  Good point - look at SDCC this year - it‚Äôs going to be empty af
[4:08:06] instant_savage: but the number of tickets of limited and blizzard knows it will sell out. But all the streaming stuff would be uncapped potential
[4:08:07] Redbearded16: !drops

[4:08:19] mavericks312: Packed*

[4:08:56] 91Niki: @Eshel Well that also has a lot to do with the strike atm. Actors under the union aren't allowed to attend conventions
[4:09:18] ac1dburn395: whens the new raid
[4:09:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: @XLcoj happened once we with wow classic
[4:09:37] Eshel: @91niki Aye but they were announcing cancellations and no shows weeks before the strikes

[4:11:04] Nerendis: Oh shit, I forgot about the survival game.
[4:11:08] XLcoj: Diablo 4 xpac sorry
[4:11:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: i did the benefit dinner which was nice because it was much easier to talk to devs, the actual convention gets old pretty quick
[4:11:23] Snabido: KEKW
[4:11:28] Nerendis: @XLcoj Warcraft 4 and Starcraft 3 will never happen
[4:11:28] Arocian: yeah, would be cool if they could drop demo's on the battle.net
[4:11:40] Eshel: They still have that mobile game queued up to drop on us lol
[4:12:19] mavericks312: The sloot mode effect you could say
[4:12:26] 3663Sharad: Some news for Starcraft would be dope
[4:12:59] DewyAdventures: Im the DH! :D @Towelliee

[4:14:15] pirlivewire: i think this blizzcon might be a MS + blizz final buyout
[4:14:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @Towelliee does the Blue Yeti mic have a good sound pickup when sitting on top of the desk with default mount, or should I get a mic arm/boom to bring it closer to my face?
[4:14:26] pirlivewire: annoucment
[4:15:12] Eshel: Biggest tip I found for this boss - his hit box is larger than you think - plenty of room to stand back and find the gaps in swirly balls
[4:15:12] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:15:28] dracullus: I wonder about Starcraft, RTS is niche genre, on the other hand it's really strong IP not used for 10 years
[4:15:35] akacvrtops: this boss looks fun
[4:16:03] smashwow: @AlphasaurusRexx it'll work but it's going to pick up keyboard clicks and desk thumps so be aware of that. an absorb mount is nice to minimize that
[4:16:11] Wcvechten: I managed to get Gorehowl last week, neat new transmog
[4:16:22] Reckless_Monk: LOOOL
[4:16:49] instant_savage: The dh can
[4:16:57] instant_savage: If he switches to veng
[4:16:59] 3663Sharad: Maybe a bit of an edge here, but would BlizzCon be a good place to announce a series (like Starcraft, Warcraft etc)?
[4:17:07] Nerendis: @dracullus If you like RTS, check out Stormgate
[4:17:13] instant_savage: I ment loot spec
[4:17:17] instant_savage: My bad

[4:17:24] hammack52: yes
[4:17:24] Mallaes: Yeah
[4:17:25] Wcvechten: Yep

[4:19:26] Jarlan23: both the trinkets in here are good for my dps warrior and hes 445
[4:19:37] Jarlan23: the trinkets in this dungeon are insane
[4:19:38] PvtHudson093: I got a haste trinket from here because I still dont have Anvil on my ret
[4:19:40] mavericks312: You run this as a high end player for the trinkets
[4:19:46] Vesidian: hey everyone   HeyGuys HeyGuys
[4:19:54] Eshel: I got lucky - I was 435 - got in a group that only wiped twice on Morchie and twice on Deios
[4:20:09] Reckless_Monk: I want the mirror trinket even though i have mythic trinkets from Aberrus
[4:20:10] SlideCancelXDD: thats insane
[4:20:14] ElmSpace: that cheat death trinket will be in M+ though as well most likely
[4:20:34] Nerendis: I want the Tyr healing trinket. Holy shit it's broken.
[4:20:39] mavericks312: @reckless_monk yea the mirror trink sims better then the vessel off the 2nd boss of abberus for mages
[4:20:50] Reckless_Monk: @mavericks312 Yes Sir! I want it
[4:21:15] mavericks312: @reckless_monk if it wasn‚Äôt for that I‚Äôd be a 1 and done with this place

[4:33:27] PvtHudson093: ive got it but will replace it with Anvil if i get it
[4:33:31] akia03: it sims lower than hc raid trinkets for me
[4:33:48] Friend_within: @wizkillifah pretty much any end game activity, you just need to get lucky with RNG
[4:34:25] wizkillifah: I assume there are websites to tell me drop chance % of certain gear?
[4:34:51] Corevin1: wowhead @wizkillifah
[4:35:36] wizkillifah: @corevin1 has D4 info as well?
[4:35:42] Nerendis: I've never seen that either
[4:35:44] AlphasaurusRexx: amount below the leader
[4:36:07] Corevin1: yep. there is a D4 wowhead
[4:36:21] Vesidian: isn't the patch already out?
[4:36:34] Friend_within: @wizkillifah You can find drop %, but like I said you need to get lucky with the RNG to get the gear with the rolled stats that you need
[4:36:44] Etzli_GG: I like that attitude. It may not have looked great but lets see how it plays out w the new mechanics first.
[4:36:45] dracullus: have some fun in 2k23? insane

[5:28:26] Wulfgrym: @91Niki oh and they mega nerfed the life leech so being in melee is rough, my werewolf druid is 100 and just having a rough time in dungeons
[5:28:38] SaltyMystic: I too am old and simple. I like loot and a balanced skill tree. Balanced in that I don't have to run a certain build to do anything.

[5:29:30] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym yeah it's either a second rogue or druid for me i think
[5:29:31] Wulfgrym: I don't blame any player looking for a good solid build guide, that is the best option, im just pushing 700 hours on druid so im getting better at builds my self
[5:29:35] Heero_Effect: Lol it reallly crashes every time

[5:31:01] Wulfgrym: @91Niki speaking of rogue
[5:31:12] SaltyMystic: I'd like to see magic systems that aren't Ice/Fire/Lightning a little more often.
[5:31:30] Arocian: true statement though, some say they don't like MMO's but those same people like everything that's in an MMO
[5:31:35] Exodeo_: 2 years, more like 5 lol
[5:31:37] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Yeah I'm gonna see how the build I played for launch is gonna do, seeing it uses puncture
[5:31:37] Finni2011: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:32:07] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee 100% those guys need those builds
[5:32:15] dracullus: well they should aim at no expansion year for wow to release any new game
[5:32:40] SaltyMystic: NGL, I'm in it for cosmetics.
[5:32:49] Wulfgrym: no expansion? you want the playesr to burn down the servers or something LUL

[5:33:36] 91Niki: Red flag imo
[5:33:41] Heero_Effect: That‚Äôs odd
[5:33:53] dracullus: @91Niki I was talking about ashes that they should avoid late 2024/early 2025 release
[5:34:15] Wulfgrym: @warrenny whatever works but not announcing an expansion coming would be crazy IMO.
[5:34:47] Finansdepartementet: already? feels like DF just came out
[5:34:59] Incredible_Sausage: LUL another 27 month raid window from draenor
[5:35:06] warrenny: Reckon theyll fix the skip dc bug?
[5:35:07] dracullus: imo 10.2 will be final raid anyway and S4 will be full length fated raids
[5:35:14] Nerendis: Yeah but I enjoy DF lol
[5:35:19] warrenny: Dfs like 8 months
[5:35:22] Finansdepartementet: must be it
[5:35:32] mavericks312: You say DF feels like it just came out is could it was so good
[5:35:39] Nerendis: SL might actually be the worst expac I've ever played
[5:35:42] warrenny: @nerendis I enjoyed both
[5:35:44] mavericks312: Cause*
[5:35:54] Eraste: SL got me into ff14 and i found a lot of joy there, so it worked out. DF has been fun too i just wish i still had friends to play with, pugging is basically impossible for me
[5:35:54] SoulSlayer088: 8 months ago
[5:35:55] reggiepowa: 3 raids is not good content cadence imo but we will see
[5:35:55] Snabido: december?
[5:35:56] Nerendis: Nov 28, 2022
[5:36:00] dracullus: tbh WoD lasted like 8 months after that all we talked about was Legion xD
[5:36:02] warrenny: November 2-something
[5:36:06] Finni2011: november 2022
[5:36:09] Shrenko: @Nerendis how come?
[5:36:29] Rturnerz: I‚Äôve played since vanilla and SL was the only expansion I quit before even getting max level
[5:36:31] warrenny: @dracullus Wasnt it mop then legion whats wod? Kappa
[5:36:41] Wulfgrym: yeah stick with the formula lol

[5:36:54] Heero_Effect: @eraste random guild man
[5:36:57] dracullus: @warrenny fever dream
[5:37:14] reggiepowa: like I dont care how many .5 patches they release but I want 4 raids per expansions
[5:37:24] mavericks312: Give us that void vs light
[5:37:30] Eraste: @Heero_Effect idk, i tried but its just too much anxiety. i dont want to jump from guild to guild finding people that can play somewhat decently
[5:37:30] kalamari__: I wasnt here when you discussed the release cadence, but is there a possibility there wil be a 10.4?
[5:37:41] mentulgg: hand raised
[5:37:43] Finansdepartementet: there's always that one good restaurant that changes the owner and the recipes get shit
[5:37:48] Etzli_GG: DF was a massive W for Blizzard. It brought me back
[5:37:51] Wulfgrym: LUL
[5:37:57] Eshel: Lol my joke got auto deleted
[5:38:00] HasjSNAke: LULW

[5:38:05] falldrgn: Boomer bullies Warchief..
[5:38:07] Nerendis: This is the same conversation we had like 2.5 hours ago lol
[5:38:10] mavericks312: Want 4 raids go play classic lol
[5:38:16] zeiours: I want 10 raids Kappa
[5:38:16] reggiepowa: Shruge
[5:38:17] mentulgg: think he means the owner not ian lol

[5:38:33] Eshel: inb4 everyone starts begging for beta keys
[5:38:45] Nerendis: August would be good. But ICC is soon
[5:38:46] Shrenko: I HATE YOU
[5:38:54] Snabido: Mount collectors in shambles
[5:38:56] Tompsn_: bruh
[5:38:57] Hebrewish012: throwing scorpion in trash lol
[5:38:58] warrenny: Dude üò≠
[5:39:09] avarose8910: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:39:09] Eraste: BG3 soon, no time in august KEKW
[5:39:18] warrenny: Farming done like 8 attempts since patch so far

[5:39:28] Snabido: True, tusks is the real rarity in SoO
[5:39:33] SaltyMystic: Mmm BG3.
[5:39:34] dracullus: oof I'm glad I grabbed shoulders from BMAH when Blizz was 'celebrating' Garrosh geting out of hell xD
[5:39:49] Wcvechten: at this point you should do SoO danceparties like the ICC ones
[5:39:53] Shrenko: thaank god they added a skip for SoO atleast
[5:39:56] ZooNamiii: does siege of org ...have a skip ?
[5:40:03] dracullus: yep on all on same time
[5:40:15] dracullus: when 9.1 raid launched
[5:40:23] pirlivewire: that mount never drop for me it i believe the mount not on my toon loot table lmao
[5:40:30] lahuskie: yea thank god for that skip even tho it dc's me everytime lol
[5:40:34] reggiepowa: tusks plus new gorehowl perfect combo
[5:40:43] papawar70: Hey.
[5:40:44] ZooNamiii: yes
[5:40:47] valianya: DF is a much better template pattern to base future expansions on than the way they tried and repeatedly failed to recapture Legion (but without the class specific focus that made it so good)
[5:41:03] ShrenTheOrc: i got it yesterday
[5:41:10] dracullus: and my Mag'har with tusks transmog looted Big Love Rocket when it was still 0.03% xD
[5:41:16] Calibearr: the ability to farm tusks is more interesting to me than anything else
[5:41:17] Nerendis: Legion Classic when?
[5:41:31] reggiepowa: isnt it every 6 months
[5:41:32] pirlivewire: the next expac may be DF part 2 the timelords
[5:41:34] Finansdepartementet: i saw mrgms ptr video and he got the midnight mount to drop on the new mega dungeon
[5:41:36] Eraste: no way
[5:41:51] PastelDeNata69: But if they keep releasing <expansion> Classic it becomes another Retail WoW?
[5:42:01] Nerendis: Cata classic would be such a meme. But I feel like they really want MoP classic
[5:42:07] Yagr6: so let me get this straight we getting a new raid b4 blizzcon
[5:42:13] AnimalCrackers_19: Can wait for Classic Dragonflight...
[5:42:29] dracullus: @SpoiledWisdom Wrath is already like retail WoW

[5:43:03] PastelDeNata69: @dracullus I don't understand the desire for <expansion> Classic then... It will become Retail LUL
[5:43:04] SaltyMystic: @AnimalCrackers_19 Classic Classic is going to be sweet.
[5:43:21] Nokterian: DF is amazing

[5:43:44] Eraste: damn trading post man KEKW well played
[5:43:44] Exodeo_: And yet people still say DF is dying Kappa
[5:43:47] SoulSlayer088: i just re-subbed after a few years
[5:44:02] veryhairyheyyall: DF is great
[5:44:05] abracka_: cata classic would be dead lol
[5:44:06] valianya: I still think more Classic expansions is going to be wierd because the content is present in retail, and the gameplay style is so similar to retail
[5:44:09] Wcvechten: just the xmog farming now with old scholo and the Naxx thing itself will keep  me busy for ages
[5:44:14] Nerendis: I could see that. And like I said, everybody seems to want MOP - myself included.
[5:44:16] dracullus: and if you think about unsubing Blizz is like "check this new trader post stuff" xD
[5:44:25] Eraste: id go back for a classic + probably. otherwise meh
[5:44:26] abracka_: out of all the private server populations, cata has by far the lowest amount of players
[5:44:35] TweektheProphet: if they did cata classic i feel they would need to keep the wrath servers up as well
[5:44:39] abracka_: they should realistically stop at wotlk, and start classic+
[5:44:54] PastelDeNata69: @valianya But that was true since the beginning... What was the point of Classic? To one-shot everything and be "World First" on stuff that has been done 20 years go? KEKW
[5:45:13] zemm8582: There's a soo skip now?!
[5:45:13] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[5:45:46] Nerendis: Just skip cata and do mop
[5:45:47] warrenny: @zemm8582 Yup
[5:45:48] Eshel: Classic is more than nostalgia too - it‚Äôs a way to reintroduce the story to a new generation
[5:45:53] abracka_: big gamble honestly. wotlk is almost retail, but cata is full retail
[5:46:01] Morpheusx25: WoD classic when
[5:46:12] abracka_: LOL that old school UI. that was a sick ass UI honestly
[5:46:20] tom_taunts: Huge in Japan Towelliee coming back
[5:46:24] NickLeonhearth: ooooh shit tusks inc
[5:46:29] DrkPhoenix6913: I got my SoO mount today after what, a decade of doing this place :)
[5:46:36] dracullus: if they merge achievements I'll play MoP classic just to unlock that damn Ordos on my account
[5:46:42] NickLeonhearth: close
[5:47:03] PastelDeNata69: @dracullus They won't. Imagine the uproar of Retail players...
[5:47:24] Nerendis: Bro cata questing is the way to level a toon RN. It's lightning fast.
[5:47:26] PastelDeNata69: Stuff that was obtainable in the past should stay in the past. If you wanted it, though deal.
[5:47:31] alex12645: cata had lfr and skill points dont cost anything
[5:47:43] zysmos: i don't think they'll do cata classic
[5:48:00] SaltyMystic: I miss "X is the new WoW killer."  I haven't heard that phrase in forever.
[5:48:05] Nerendis: @SpoiledWisdom What about players that didn't play. Do you think Towelliee shouldn't be allowed to farm Tusks rn?
[5:48:27] reggiepowa: I think they will re release every expansion, can't wait for Legion
[5:48:28] warrenny: Lfr but no lfg in cata classic? Itll be both or neither
[5:48:34] 1llum1n471: Damn! I forgot about resolve... lol
[5:48:35] valianya: Nobody in Classic is one shotting everything.  Its a very different style of mmo gameplay, different from the theme park style of Retail and most current mmos.  The system and world is fundamentally different from Retail and the content is different from retail because Cata overhauled the vanilla world.
[5:48:53] PastelDeNata69: @SpoiledWisdom We are talking about achievements, not Tusks specifically. Stop steering the conversation to your liking :)
[5:48:54] PigPenLen: false flag man!!! this is the internet
[5:49:12] Wcvechten: prenerf Stonecore is what I live for
[5:49:15] Nerendis: @valianya huh? every boss I've done in classic is 1 shot - even on fresh servers like SOM
[5:49:23] Snabido: Hyjal all the way
[5:49:26] botscast: fuck water
[5:49:26] abracka_: team classic+ no cata KEKW
[5:49:27] Thoreya: saw a video couple weeks ago about cata classic. they reached out to the pcata realm devs. apparently theyre gonna add m+, challenge modes, etc
[5:49:29] Thoreya: buncha changes
[5:49:30] Eraste: half of both
[5:49:32] reggiepowa: vashjir for me, loved that zone
[5:49:33] XshadowturkeyX: team vash'jir
[5:49:34] pavepawns: did u see that siege of boralus might be in s3 of m+?
[5:49:35] warrenny: Vashjir
[5:49:38] Wcvechten: I did Vashj'ir first time around, might aswell suffer again
[5:49:40] Finansdepartementet: water zone looks neat, plays like shit
[5:49:41] Snabido: Vashj'ir for the noobs, veterans go hyjal CoolCat
[5:49:43] Exodeo_: i'm erasing that water from my memory
[5:49:44] dracullus: @SpoiledWisdom if they want they'll return what they want, so you would have to deal with that too
[5:49:46] Nerendis: @SpoiledWisdom You said stuff. How could I possible know what you meant specifically.
[5:49:47] SaltyMystic: I honestly liked the water zone. It was different.
[5:49:49] mavericks312: Vash was top tier trash
[5:49:53] avarose8910: i like the music in hyjal lol
[5:50:04] reggiepowa: hopefully not, there are way better bfa dungeons
[5:50:04] NobodybetterPat: break yourselves upon my body.. i can hear it now
[5:50:08] 1llum1n471: Vashjir!!!
[5:50:11] PastelDeNata69: @SpoiledWisdom Just watch the quote I replied to :)
[5:50:16] estrellaqueen88: me too
[5:50:17] LivelyBanter: !drops
[5:50:17] Moobot: @LivelyBanter towBleedpurple TY FOR COMING TO ANOTHER DROPATHON MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW AS YOUR #1 SOURCE FOR WOW DROPS! towBleedpurple
[5:50:18] Wcvechten: Visually it's great though, but 3d as melee is pain
[5:50:26] Eraste: lol i loved that zone i dont understand the hate
[5:50:32] Durithane: You should do it once to share our pain ...LOL
[5:50:32] Snabido: When you reach that achievement hunting part of your wow career, you will do vashjir, mr T
[5:50:40] XshadowturkeyX: good less people going to vashjir means i can quest in peace
[5:50:51] estrellaqueen88: hate comes from envy
[5:51:07] pirlivewire: vashjir was so easy to play just think of it as a space ship games
[5:51:13] XshadowturkeyX: LOL
[5:51:18] Thoreya: cata made me quit the game till legion, but if the changes they make are true, ill def give it another shot
[5:51:18] NobodybetterPat: only people in vash are the ones still trying to sell that seahorse
[5:51:24] SaltyMystic: Now is a good time to build up our strongholds.
[5:51:36] rxdderz_: whats the go to content this patch? a  bit out of the WoW loop! :D
[5:51:43] pavepawns: i liked vashjr as a 1 time only thing. but not as a thing id ever wanna do again
[5:51:54] Wulfgrym: no one is there = all the hardcore players calculating going there
[5:51:58] Thoreya: gimme MOP classic over cata
[5:52:04] valianya: You say one shot and I think killing in one hit, not one pull.  And its still a fundamentally different style of mmo from retail.  Its ok if you don't want to play, I don't play Classic either.  But you can acknowledge its a different way to play an mmo.
[5:52:06] abracka_: STOP IT LOL
[5:52:12] Eshel: People‚Äôs heads would explode lol
[5:52:15] Wcvechten: WOD classic but they release it without cutting content
[5:52:20] rivera9: I'll play WoD classic to make gold and pay fory game time
[5:52:28] beefyalien97: @Towelliee have you seen OW2 is on steam now?
[5:52:32] dracullus: WoD classic is perfect for classic and I'm dead serious, great raids and almost 0 farming
[5:52:41] rivera9: I'll make 20 garrisons
[5:52:48] abracka_: moving your garrison to wherever you want
[5:52:55] pavepawns: ogre kingdom too
[5:52:56] SaltyMystic: Ooh Director's Cut WoW.
[5:52:59] Wcvechten: the entire train railway throughout Gorgrond and more
[5:53:02] reggiepowa: Every expansion would be good with some changes. Shadowlands with everything from 9.1.5 on launch would be great plus faster patch releases
[5:53:03] hollowedlyfe: towStop towIt NotLikeThis
[5:53:09] Tompsn_: cant wait to play my 2 button arms warrior in Wod

[5:55:12] madbombz_fth: august 10
[5:55:26] dracullus: omg blue post from Bobby himself
[5:55:32] valianya: I'd like to see the cut content added as Classic + and maybe eventually Retail.  They've cut content even as far back as Wrath, they planned an underdark Nerubian empirestuff, from Cata they cut an underwater raid for rescuing Neptulon.
[5:55:38] Eraste: a second platform to ignore OW2 on KEKW
[5:55:39] Wulfgrym: steam, microsoft invading already LUL
[5:55:42] abracka_: let's get wow on valve too so i can lay in bed with my steam deck playing KEKW
[5:55:52] Heero_Effect: WoW on steam coming soon
[5:56:01] toobaked1987: toobaked1987 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! Where does the time go?
[5:56:02] abracka_: wow on steam** not valve. brain is dead today apparently
[5:56:21] dracullus: I hope it isn't OV2 on steam launching battle net app

[5:57:48] abracka_: world is ending
[5:57:54] Heero_Effect: Eh‚Ä¶I could see Diablo on. Steam
[5:57:57] Incredible_Sausage: D4 will be on gamepass soon enough too
[5:57:59] warrenny: Who owns valve?
[5:58:00] dracullus: @SpoiledWisdom of course it requires account to track all your cosmetics/progress etc., but if it launch second launcher like let's say GTA.. oof xD
[5:58:07] Sollice: Valve owns Vale
[5:58:10] Eraste: i wouldnt call it a hack. im pretty stupid and i got d4 and d2 on steam deck easy

[5:58:17] madbombz_fth: overlord GABE

[5:58:43] Gitmm: GabeN
[5:58:44] o_xerxes: I'd assume like most other platforms, buying it on Steam would also mean they'd have to download the B.net app, so it benefits them too
[5:58:56] Eraste: @Mynian runs great. you have to do a couple of things but its far from hacking
[5:58:59] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @RxdderzTV (warning)

[5:59:37] Finansdepartementet: But, what one person are we to blame everything for now?
[5:59:47] Mynian: You don't have to hack it, you just install the bnet launcher in desktop mode and add it to your library. It runs just fine
[5:59:53] Wulfgrym: if microsoft is a big investor all games iwll be on there eventually
[5:59:56] ijuki: "toomanycents" as well

[6:16:04] Mr_Pennywise_: @ruededay60 he is not tho
[6:16:04] Incredible_Sausage: yalls discord and twitch names should match to avoid fuckery

[6:29:06] dracullus: even D2 sounds like a stretch
[6:29:17] Padraigah: @Lulaboo  When should I expect a mod to contact me and will it be via Twitch or Discord?  I just had to enable whispers so may not have gotten it if it was already sent on Twitch.
[6:29:17] valianya: D2, D1, maybe D3, SC 1, HoTS, WC1, 2, 3reforged, HS
[6:29:30] Honvar: Thanks @Armdel  and @mikejensenn24 !
[6:29:36] SoulSlayer088: I bet it is so that it can be used on the Steam Deck
[6:30:00] Lulaboo: @padraigah probably discord, none of the other mods are around right now and I‚Äôm not at my computer
[6:30:02] 1llum1n471: Warcraft 3 Reforgw
[6:30:04] dracullus: even calling it 2.0 would be better
[6:30:06] FullmetalD: overwatch on steam GREAT more asshole to babysit
[6:30:12] Armdel: they are deleting battle net TheIlluminati
[6:30:14] Lulaboo: I‚Äôll let them know to do discord @padraigah
[6:30:17] 1llum1n471: Warcraft 3 Reforged Kappa
[6:30:17] Eraste: if i wanted to get verbally abused regularly id play OW2
[6:30:19] N3llee: if they hadnt baited players on everything they promised for ow2 people might want to play it
[6:30:28] UlsterFarl: I was hyped for Overwatch PVE when they decided to scrap it, I lost all interest in it.
[6:30:31] Padraigah: @Lulaboo Okay great, thanks!  Discord will be better for me anyway.  Thanks so much!
[6:30:36] valianya: Might intend Arclight and Survival games on Steam and Gamepass
[6:30:47] Shrenko: haha yeah, insane to say but its true
[6:31:05] N3llee: 6v6 was such more enjoyable
[6:31:06] Baldarsar: change it back to lootboxes and bring out the single player story
[6:31:07] dracullus: and they were improved over time, I think there were no repetitions later on
[6:31:15] N3llee: the changes they made just are just bad
[6:31:16] SoulSlayer088: playing overwatch on a steam deck would be better than the switch for handheld gaming
[6:31:17] FullmetalD: junkrat ftw just saying
[6:31:26] TweektheProphet: i liked loot boxes however it is seen as gambling which did not allow for the game in some regions @Towelliee
[6:31:29] ashwing_: They really shot themselves in the foot with scrapping the PvE
[6:31:40] Eraste: whatever happened to that mobiel game? it looks fun i want to play it
[6:32:06] vic_ave: if they don't go pc they will lose alot of Rev

[6:33:10] ursinealli: ah
[6:33:32] Eraste: do we know when it might come out? i definitely want to play it
[6:33:41] valianya: The thing is, Steam will catch more casual players and new players that don't already play WoW games
[6:33:45] FullmetalD: i swear aside from farming tusks you love watching thrall get his ass kicked
[6:33:53] FearTheFarmers00: ive been excited about arclight, but dang hurry up

[6:40:07] dracullus: @SpoiledWisdom I think this 50% is already gone no matter what, it's just like tourists in wow expacs, they come play a month and leave until next one
[6:40:20] PigPenLen: i read these things all the time and I am telling you that this is a bad one for wow
[6:40:38] 1llum1n471: MW did that even through the assassination attempt after the Nick incident

[6:42:45] zomboo420: huh

[6:42:50] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[6:42:52] N3llee: may not be the best selling
[6:43:29] Nokterian: it only became better when 9.1.5 came out
[6:43:30] mistifiar: where can i find the patch note from today
[6:43:31] N3llee: 100% agree retention is more valuable from a wall street perspective
[6:43:34] zomboo420: Legion was way better than mop
[6:43:35] Nokterian: removing restrictions
[6:43:40] Thoreya: its legion df and BC for me
[6:43:41] zysmos: it's very good
[6:43:59] Nokterian: KEKW
[6:44:01] Arocian: lol they already got yo money
[6:44:04] dracullus: why should we even care about sales, there is even too much people in time rifts xD
[6:44:06] Gingerprimer: Also a lot of ppl soured on wow  with how bad SL was
[6:44:11] Mortiie_: "Maybe the comments will be nice" - lol
[6:44:18] Thoreya: wowhead people are a different breed
[6:44:20] valianya: Retention usually drops a lot after launch, but its dropped less than typical meaning its engaging and well liked
[6:44:28] zomcneese: Another thing that can keep wow subs up though is classic
[6:44:34] Arocian: lol
[6:44:42] Tyr7: am a casual player and just aim for aotc. Dragonflight has really been great. Then again I have never stopped playing wow since BC :P
[6:44:49] Heero_Effect: I had more fun in SL‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm not trolling just better guild, more friends.

[6:45:20] unowncreature: They won't get more people until the next expansion is a hitter too.
[6:45:21] dracullus: on the other hand wowhead put article "blizzard let me spend my money in your shop", so there is lack of sanity on both sides there xD
[6:45:41] mc85000: Anyone currently in Diablo 4 I need help
[6:45:46] Nokterian: Thanks to the return of talent tree's
[6:45:54] valianya: The Blizzard management doesn't want to admit they screwed up past expansions
[6:45:55] temp3st98: and still people are still mad LUL
[6:45:59] SlurpeeCapital: A bunch of my old guildies who left for FF came back and are having fun in wow now
[6:46:23] Gingerprimer: I think only way to advertise to ppl is putting out more banger expansions
[6:46:23] PigPenLen: its hard to bring back folks that left due to toxicity of the more competitive parts of the game.. its why I don't mythic raid
[6:46:29] Runatta: bro valve didnt send any info on my steam deck shipping i didnt know it was suppose to show up today but it did
