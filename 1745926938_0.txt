[0:56:29] BullzaiFTW: "It can be said straight away that there is no such thing as a Battlebit Original (and at the same time there is). There was no other game before Battlebit that could be called an original. So why does Battlebit have Remaster in its name? It is related to the long production cycle."

[2:13:58] iSyNN99: Crack

[2:14:55] mink_music: @truebrock with this many players if time to kill is too low, like insta head shots, it would be pure suffering
