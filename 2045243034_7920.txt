[2:53:06] Edeslash: @eyxx yeah according to the council of warlock mains, nobody else should be running aoe talents except for warlocks (but that's also how every top 100 guild did it, warlock practically soloing roots)

[3:01:14] Edeslash: the beam visual is misleading and the beam is actually larger than what it looks like

[3:15:57] blakethecake789: So whats the reason they are wiping? Are people on their team unfamiliar with mechanics and they are failing them or is it small mistakes like positioning and someone gets hit with a big attack
[3:15:59] Edeslash: @xazaars you need a more mobile spec (a more Zased one)
[3:16:37] 7969moobs: can u cast europe mat please @MightyTeapot
[3:16:45] Edeslash: @blakethecake789 this fight requires extreme precision and coordination and you have to be able to play your spec on a high level while also doing all the dodging, positioning, dispelling, buffing allies, mounting up and flying, using defensives, self heals, everything
[3:16:52] cronic: IM GONNA MAAAAAAAAT BatChesting
[3:17:09] kosalol1: Cronic behave this chat is serious
[3:17:16] cronic: ok sorry
[3:17:22] Edeslash: @blakethecake789 so yeah small mistakes lead to wipes here and they are unfamiliar and once you kill this boss you basically know almost the entire fight from memory
[3:17:39] Byrchi: this fight requires extreme precision and 500iq coordination and you have to be able to play your spec on nasa level while also doing all the dodging, positioning, dispelling, buffing allies, mounting up and flying to the moon, using defensives, self heals, everything

[3:19:26] Edeslash: this boss is very chill (after the absolutely gigantic nerfs it received before 10.2.5)

[3:22:43] limeoflight: @ashla11 w-why would your class affect your fps? HUH
[3:23:01] ashla11: because I was casting implosion with like 20 + imps
[3:23:16] limeoflight: ah demo, makes sense
[3:23:19] Edeslash: tindral used to be harder before MAT
[3:23:27] ashla11: just the amount of damage packets being generated was what I assumed was the cause

[3:26:41] xazaars: the thing i dislike this tier is that quite a few bosses have sigh high spell effects clutter that it really gets into way of playing the fight
[3:27:20] limeoflight: @xazaars come to gw2 we cant even see the bosses cause of combo fields KEKHeim
[3:27:28] Edeslash: @ciraxa yeah that nerf already happened as soon as 200 guild had killed this
[3:27:33] Edeslash: but yeah fyrakk gets the same treatment for sure
[3:28:10] emecci: a key for a tree
[3:28:19] ciraxa: @ciraxa sure it got nerfed pretty hard, but they¬¥ll nuke it for cross realm pugging
[3:28:44] Edeslash: 2nd to last bosses have generally not been cross realm pugged
[3:28:47] Edeslash: that would be very exceptional
[3:29:26] Edeslash: like last tier cross realm pugs were usually either 3/9 or 5/9 bosses and a lot of groups weren't able to kill 5 even if they tried to
