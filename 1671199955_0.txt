[3:53:05] highlife42091: you don't need to upgrade pvp gear aswell it only benefits the pve side of ilvl it doesn't actually level your pvp ill it stays at 411 unless you get the sets which is 424 I think
[3:53:38] BoricuaSJ: and the one we already got it goes up to 411, so it's best to upgrade to epic. so I am not going to buy any yet.
