[0:15:34] dooshken: Actually 300 ping
[0:15:37] Agrero7: so sad
[0:15:52] prikaze: did u see the move drama today?
[0:15:57] acidtrip1312: it makes sense blizzard can't afford a LAN, they're only worth 74 billion dollars
[0:16:01] code_rage: Don't feel bad, if they feel that way that's a looser mindset and therefore they don't deserve victory. You always play to win no matter what, no matter the odds, live advise
[0:16:07] jamesxqp: imagine willingly signing up for a tourney and then complaining about the same tourney
[0:16:07] romserrrr: whaaz needs trill coaching this is not normally
[0:16:09] SaltyBites: I mean that Hoolibang would 3-0 them on lan
[0:16:17] DCBen: are they the only one from eastcoast?
[0:16:23] Atte0825: have you watched other games between your matches?
[0:16:47] romserrrr: maybe innervate keeps your 5buff all game
[0:16:49] romserrrr: liquid tech
[0:16:53] skystepx: @Whaazz oggi have u seen my message before? the Echo Tshirt one? xD
[0:16:54] n0tDef1ned: also you played killing spree
[0:16:56] sind233: Cdew telling Raiku that he has 3 kids and they dont cry as much as him was pretty funny though LUL
[0:16:57] n0tDef1ned: how come
[0:16:58] prikaze: did u notice move drama today
[0:17:09] stepkoudny: what is twitter drama?
[0:17:29] n0tDef1ned: linksss
[0:17:33] n0tDef1ned: pls
[0:17:35] loveshock7: poor jb :(
[0:17:36] Shaltytoxic: where can i find the drama?
[0:17:37] acidtrip1312: liquid are playing very well, but so far thye're the only relevant NA team
[0:17:38] Dispenze: sad situation :(
[0:17:38] Noli_HS: what happened at the move?
[0:17:41] bottger93: What is the drama about chat?
[0:17:47] acidtrip1312: @Shaltytoxic jellybeans was live like 30min explaining all
[0:17:48] dooshken: dont talk about that please
[0:17:49] loveshock7: jb not in the move anymore
[0:17:54] jamesxqp: they arent winning cuz of the ping if you knew ping was an issue dont sign up for a cross region tourney its simple.
[0:17:56] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz
[0:18:01] prikaze: They went behind his back and told him They dont want to play with him in toruney so They kicked him i watched jelly stream
[0:18:08] oakleafresin: WHAAZ DOES TODAY PLAYING THE MOVE ?
[0:18:09] Dispenze: yeah if you guys want to know what happened check jellys vod
[0:18:15] dooshken: jelly is the only one who talked about it, every already has taken his side
[0:18:15] spoikkii: I mean raiku could complain little less too about the ping, but great games today keep it up!
[0:18:19] dooshken: not appropriate
[0:18:24] cubiis: "don't sign up" LUL
[0:18:31] voygard: that's a very lets say dentge take
[0:18:32] Atte0825: first match against the move was spicey
[0:18:32] br187x: thats true fr
[0:18:40] br187x: all pro teams should have the lowest possible ping
[0:18:41] cubiis: this is money income
[0:18:44] br187x: lan servers
[0:18:46] jamesxqp: then whats your genius solution fly out all EU players to NA??
[0:18:47] Gimchy: dont make shit tourneys, its all Blizz fault lol, fucking kids saying dont sign up
[0:19:01] voygard: yea bro just dont play as a pro competitive player KEKW
[0:19:02] arigoldfish: Jelly got removed from the team. He got RL struggles/bad attitude so they "ditched" him from how i understood it rather than being his friend
[0:19:02] dooshken: fair
[0:19:03] Slaktarnlol: thay kicked JB out becouse the rest in the move tohught jb was bitching to much. There is a vod about it on jellys stream
[0:19:06] sarent02: 2k each kappa
[0:19:08] threesixnineee: they should just move on when it stands 2:2 and let the team win who wins 2 in a row after 2:2
[0:19:13] acidtrip1312: apparently jellybeans tried to improve some of their games like saying what could have been done better but absterge went on a powertrip and told him that he doesnt make mistakes that he's plain perfect and shut him up few times, it escalated and they sided with absterge so they kicked jelly
[0:19:18] dooshken: I like that idea
[0:19:30] dooshken: the ping difference on major games is so lame tbh
[0:19:30] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[0:19:49] linuswarlock: trill makes outlaw look so fucking insane
[0:19:56] skystepx: @Whaazz just wow
[0:20:06] voygard: @CheseX yea he pumps hella hard
[0:20:08] acidtrip1312: liquid are definitely playing very very well, but unfortunately they're the only relevant NA team
[0:20:18] tuttifruttipop: yo, great job & ggs to Echo !
[0:20:22] voygard: previous game was doing 110k+ dps
[0:20:22] Moobot: https://www.instagram.com/oscar_wulff/
[0:20:25] voygard: crazy dmg
[0:20:27] xcires: @Whaazz how was it for you today playing on NA servers with the ping? how high was your ping?
[0:20:28] Steely97x: sams boomie is pog
[0:20:32] OGBeads: coffee is the most kitable DH, he refuses to play immo aura dispel
[0:20:46] pettunix: trill has playing rogue outlaw as much you play sub
[0:21:12] jamesxqp: did you see them play dh rogue?
[0:21:18] br187x: coffey is like off the game
[0:21:22] br187x: the cc from sam is crazy
[0:21:27] br187x: i really wanna see crowd control done
[0:21:33] dooshken: Coffey is so insane for this ping

[0:36:49] kelqoo: @Minimove jelly talked about it earlier, shit going on in his life so he was grumpy for a while and instead of talkign to him about it they let it build up too long
[0:36:56] lmaoerss: gratz on win today, i saw you were too scared to pull out the rogue vs pika eh? 4Head @Whaazz
[0:36:58] Brunhity: ofc NA is unplayable idk why ppl are trying to defend it

[1:32:57] DCBen: Summary: Jelly is going through ”heavy IRL shit”. He says that made him grumpy during practice. So the others decided they dont want to play the tourney with him and the bad vibes, but would still split the money. Wiz said Jelly needs helps, which he reacted poorly to and called Wiz ”dumbfuck”. Jelly regrets that badly. Now he feels super betrayed, and wishes they had checked in with how he was feeling

[2:26:25] OGBeads: @fredslfm no they kicked him before that, that's when they cut him off prize money
[2:26:30] Ephixza: they just left him hanging, his expected  loyalty and friendship, turned out they are only after interest period

[2:32:51] ownagekitty: removing him from the roster is too far though
[2:32:52] mvpala_tv: thats why you swept their dumbass lmaoooo
[2:32:52] aframpp: i hope the move come out honestly and dont say anything
[2:32:54] Noli_HS: also noone knows the whole picutre of this story. this is their shit and they should handle it.
[2:32:54] OGBeads: regardless of how precise this is, kicking him out right before and cutting him off the prize money is a massive dick move
[2:32:54] lacknothing: Isnt he going to ruin his further coms with them by airing it all on twitch
[2:32:55] Releaserage: jelly joins another team, and beat the move in finals 2025 EZ Clap
[2:32:56] jorg82: I can respect teams, but teams consist of ppl. Those ppl does not deserve any respect after that
[2:33:06] ownagekitty: the move took it too far
[2:33:06] moltencrucible: @OGBeads agree.
[2:33:07] echterdolens: did u ever trashtalked raiku
[2:33:16] thumper2424: @OGBeads agreed
[2:33:16] 00ZZEE: If he got kicked AND they dont wanna share the prize money after they have played together until now, then thats kinda fucked up no matter the other side
[2:33:17] gaussace: the sad thing is they kicked him without talking to him first. At least what i got from the vid.

[2:33:44] awumbahway: Mental health in men is important if jelly is struggling friends should be there to lean on
[2:33:46] Audinion98: Jelly has always been a straightforward dude it feels like, so I believe him more because of that
[2:33:47] lacknothing: Its empathy
[2:33:48] ginsters1: the things hes saying probably seems harsher than normal because hes so close to them, always easier to insult your friends etc in an aggressive way because youve done it 100x in a jokey way before
[2:33:50] Dyazah: @ownagekitty cheated?

[2:36:27] davErosEe: it’s fine to cut someone but the way it was handled was childish and unprofessional.
[2:36:32] locombg: Be honest he's crying lol like he's a grown man not his friends job to know when he's emotional like just tell your boys you want to talk he pointing fingers
[2:36:33] Xawo87: i still dont understand what happend?
[2:36:36] blocker94: @bobthegoblin_ are they friends? even ahrded then to seperate buisness and friends
[2:36:36] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:36:39] aframpp: There has to be things he isn't saying surely
[2:36:41] scardef: maybe they did, and he didn't pick up on it.. like you said, there are many sides to each story
[2:36:43] 00ZZEE: chan is gonna clip that "i realized chan is right"
[2:36:46] chrisiirc: yeah this all should have been spoken and resolved in private. but if he cant get through to them i understand him venting on stream
[2:36:47] Venenu: yeah but they dont talk to him. from his side they just just talk in his back
[2:36:50] Abruaz: 3 sides to every story 1 side the other side and the truth @Whaazz
[2:36:51] qkmood: chan learned from uncle snutz
[2:36:51] lilplatotv: link the vod
[2:36:56] ownagekitty: taking his prize money that's too far
[2:36:56] bobthegoblin_: @blocker94 ofc theyre friends, why the fk would they have him on the team when his class is bad
[2:36:56] iiiidan1994: u have no pressure u did not even play a rog
[2:36:57] Steely97x: Chan seems like he would just say stfu move on xd
[2:36:58] storm_chaser_ron: everyone is reacting prematurely andy today
[2:36:59] Noli_HS: they seem to be past that. and jelly is rly emotional ofc
[2:36:59] Xawo87: which vod is it?
[2:37:06] Ceribi: this is like liquid breaking up tbh
[2:37:14] Thoreya: @Xawo87 today
[2:37:16] ownagekitty: fine they ain't friends ok, but have honor
[2:37:20] OGBeads: @locombg his boys decided to kick him out instead of even wondering or reaching out, so yeah @his boys@
[2:37:23] Ceribi: ya jelly too emotional
[2:37:25] ownagekitty: give him his cut
[2:37:37] Jkrx: Chan even bullied pojke on wrath classic Gigachad
[2:37:43] sid3n: can some1 give me the rundown on the chan thing he's talking about?
[2:37:44] bobthegoblin_: fake friends, unlucky
[2:37:45] Lontartv: meanwhile @Whaazz kicks the ULTRABULL when is on his lowest
[2:37:47] prikaze: jelly is like top hunter hes up there with kasu and bicmex for sure hes good on hunter
[2:37:48] Lontartv: Sadge
[2:37:48] Sikaan: just dont be that guy
[2:37:48] chrisiirc: yeah its very sad

[2:37:57] hongerlapp: only a fan of bald whaazz
[2:37:57] fredslfm: LOL Lontar
[2:37:58] alllucknoskill: This aint the move though
[2:37:58] keeeptryin: @Ceribi they are friends of many years
[2:38:01] Lontartv: sorry
[2:38:02] Lontartv: hahah
[2:38:05] infernion: You literally kick Ultrabull after he hasn't bubbled 8 games in a row and you say this?
[2:38:06] DCBen: @Lontartv true Sadge
[2:38:06] chrisiirc: jelly is hurting bad rn :(
[2:38:06] Lontartv: had to bring the bull
[2:38:08] alllucknoskill: kinda goes against their whole process
[2:38:11] aladys22: Oh boi sterge goin live
[2:38:12] prikaze: yo lontar god healer
[2:38:12] ginsters1: absterge just went live so perhaps get other side to the story soon
[2:38:12] zyberfaze: i mean, the move DOES have a pretty immature vibe. But i must say that there will be JBs story and The moves story and there will be the truth inbetween.
[2:38:14] bakingsodayo: action reaction ->drama
[2:38:17] CardiacKcc: You guys in chat act like none of you have ever had a bad day
[2:38:19] blinkers89: @Lontartv just order a quadruple cheeseblaster with xxl fries
[2:38:20] Silveryzx__: ultrabull got ultra bullied @Lontartv
[2:38:23] Lontartv: @prikaze <3 ty for the support today i saw u bro

[2:38:38] Lontartv: yday u was so grumpy WAS INSANE
[2:38:41] Thoreya: lolol
[2:38:46] boveylol: this is whaazz in an alternate universe
[2:38:47] locombg: No wtf stop being a dipshit wtf blaming them for him being negative that's his fault like bring it up to them not their job he crying
[2:38:58] Jmdubs: absterge live now
[2:38:59] Thoreya: 5pm wtf

[2:39:02] salk76: KEKL
[2:39:03] Thoreya: day is over
[2:39:05] Berrebii: but they cant kick you because you dont play hunter 😇
[2:39:11] booba1421: @zyberfaze I ageree with that. Their vibe is a bit childish tbh
[2:39:21] locombg: Boohoo
[2:39:21] YUNG_AYAZ: bro has  a worse sleep schedule then me lol
[2:39:24] salk76: gamer moves
[2:39:28] tmAwkward: what are we watching?
[2:39:28] Obryss: u breathe your own farts?
[2:39:41] lazyturtle0824: I think it’s fair to hear other side too before judging. Jelly is going through something and the most important thing is that’s he’s ok
[2:39:42] Knozyr: @Whaazz
[2:39:44] crylztv: agree
[2:39:45] Knozyr: I have a question
[2:39:54] DCBen: 1000% agree
[2:39:58] MikeScharl: True
[2:40:00] DCBen: 10000% agree
[2:40:01] voygard: he aint wrong on that
[2:40:02] Knozyr: can you give me a TLDR @Whaazz what happened
[2:40:02] dubbfiend: kekw
[2:40:04] YUNG_AYAZ: facts
[2:40:05] OGBeads: @locombg you sound extremely unsocialbe, no idea how to process either personal or professional relationships
[2:40:17] rocky760g: yep
[2:40:26] salk76: Method Black goonerGoggles
[2:40:26] qkmood: will u adopt chas
[2:40:27] IXSharks: @Whaazz how old is this was this like yesterday or today ?
[2:40:29] tichoka: He felt really off when he ended the stream, hopefully someone checks up on him
[2:40:29] blocker94: its not about tourney money its about loosing sponsors or coms
[2:40:30] veekslol: you can tell you and him are like a married couple haha
[2:40:31] bobthegoblin_: yeah same for Jelly, so imagine if Raiku kicked u cause u were grumpy for a few days
[2:40:35] dela___: Gayge
[2:40:37] MikeScharl: the pricepool is a joke anyway
[2:40:38] Necrolancer47: Who won it all chat? I’m in my phone and can’t hear
[2:40:39] Steff_988: i think there was a bit of over-reaction from all sides, and i think they all need some time to figure things out. i hope they realize that and get back together.
[2:40:39] sylvanas97: he calls you oscar while u call him raiku.. why is that
[2:40:39] crylztv: men love men Kappa
[2:40:40] prikaze: dude lontar want the money for burgers lol
[2:40:40] MikeScharl: for that afford

[2:40:45] kevvandh: what happend??
[2:40:49] IXSharks: @Whaazz how old is this was this like yesterday or today ? 󠀀
[2:40:50] aframpp: True
[2:40:55] dokezpvp: Who was the guy again that said prize money from wow was shit live on blizzard stream think it was in wod
[2:40:56] shizzon: do you think his team will appreaciate this video?
[2:40:57] wardelswijk: you can trust him with anything except iceblock :D
[2:40:59] balofowow: cs had better prizes for tournaments in 2007 or some shit kekw
[2:41:02] bobthegoblin_: I feel like they wanted a reason to remove him cause his class is bad ngl
[2:41:06] Raikubest: I was lucky i wasnt there when chan was raging at you in the wargames LOL on the opposite side we were super pumped LOL
[2:41:08] vaniteaDH: who is this guy?
[2:41:09] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz
[2:41:11] Ahbe: can somoene give me a recap
[2:41:14] M4dmanGG: Can someone in the chat tell me wtf happend?
[2:41:14] booba1421: I the whole time was for echo with whaaaz man 😁
[2:41:15] Knozyr: Carl is out of control man
[2:41:17] Knozyr: I love Jason
[2:41:26] Lontartv: never saw chan raging more at some1
[2:41:27] Lontartv: KEKW
[2:41:30] OGBeads: if it's a frienly relationship they should care about their friend, if it's a professional one you give him the prize money since he was part of the team til then, then kick
[2:41:32] Knozyr: @Raikubest you gotta sort your haircut out blud
[2:41:33] Lontartv: i wanted to rage but i let chan do it
[2:41:34] Lontartv: KEKW
[2:41:41] Steely97x: sterge starting his stream
[2:41:42] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:41:46] bobthegoblin_: the one thing I love the most about Chan is that he will always speak if he has an issue
[2:41:47] Akrololz: channXD channXD channXD channXD channXD
[2:41:50] frege2k: @M4dmanGG jelly got kicked for being negative in practice and he's upset that his teammates didn't handle it better
[2:41:51] prikaze: u can rage on Spanish lol
[2:41:53] dokezpvp: Who was the guy again that said prize money from wow was shit live on blizzard stream think it was in wod
[2:41:56] MikeScharl: Hahaha
[2:41:58] aframpp: xD
[2:41:58] ALjalladTv: LUL
[2:42:00] mranabol29: I hope once the situation has calmed down that they can talk normally about the topic and get closer to each other again. They've been friends for ages and there's nothing that can't be sorted out. There are always arguments, that's human.
[2:42:01] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC
[2:42:01] DCBen: you have a VoD? OMEGALUL
[2:42:04] fredslfm: Whaazz needed a siesta
[2:42:06] nokster: just play with jamie, he would never give precog
[2:42:11] M4dmanGG: @frege2k thanks! Thats sad :(
[2:42:23] Lathrien: Jelly is not just grumpy. He is actually borderline and starts shit out of the blue for no reason. Not talking shit, I feel bad for him.
[2:42:33] frege2k: @M4dmanGG very short explanation, but thats the situation in a nutshell
[2:42:41] rudeqt: jelly left the move
[2:42:45] rudeqt: ?
[2:42:55] blocker94: @Lathrien true or u thinking it is he rly ill?
[2:43:00] dorgardra: im coming into this late, is the short story, they kicked him from "The move" because he was being toxic in their eyes?
[2:43:01] lacknothing: Lathrien did you just try and offend jb by saying he hws a mental disorder?
[2:43:01] veekslol: got removed from roster
[2:43:02] St0nedCan00k: monkaS
[2:43:03] aframpp: Sterge just went live
[2:43:04] bobthegoblin_: @Lathrien ur mentally ill, u have no idea what the situation was over
[2:43:05] lacknothing: Thats our of order bro
[2:43:06] mranabol29: mranabol29 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:43:20] lacknothing: Out*
[2:43:21] Akrololz: time for a host
[2:43:23] Akrololz: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:43:27] Betaxrofl: hahah
[2:43:28] locombg: He just crying to be honest grow up
[2:43:30] rocky760g: all of em act like manchildren idk
[2:43:40] sylvanas97: ye hosting sterge is the move
[2:43:41] sarent02: @Akrololz lmap
[2:43:41] MikeScharl: Its sad man
[2:43:44] Lathrien: @blocker94 Re-read my message and try again
[2:43:46] spacemans11: What's going on?
[2:43:47] frege2k: i feel like everyone who's handling these irl situations on stream is childish
[2:43:49] Altan97: i haven't seen a single person that talks "good vibes" that wasn't super toxic "off-camera"
[2:43:57] prikaze: raiku DH vs the move  3-0 LOL
[2:43:59] Evolutionslayerz: What happened ?
[2:44:01] dskamin29: can u now watch absterge and react to absterge plz
[2:44:04] deltahamster77: isn’t that pika’s brother?
[2:44:18] bobthegoblin_: @frege2k thats a dumb way to think considering they have built a brand based on their friendship
[2:44:19] MikeScharl: i feel him
[2:44:19] Joke_Fistweaver: look at his body language
[2:44:21] aframpp: WILD
[2:44:27] threesixnineee: @deltahamster77 thats what i thought too
[2:44:28] TheNutcracka: damn man thats so sad :(
[2:44:32] Betaxrofl: lol he went rom 20 veiwers to700 in like 10 secs :D
[2:44:36] IronlakPat: poor dude
[2:44:37] crylztv: they should stop this shit and shake hands <3
[2:44:50] frege2k: @bobthegoblin_ idk, theres literally nothing to gain by handling it this way
[2:44:58] Knozyr: Carl won't talk it out, guys ego got out of control
[2:44:59] Explicitiz: that they do that mid tourney too is not human, whatever they go through as a team they still can do this after the cup
[2:45:00] imyoungdraco: when he refers to "what they did" does he mean just removing him
[2:45:04] Steely97x: no
[2:45:04] waitimdesyncd: absterge isnt fully online yet
[2:45:05] ayjayzz: what happen
[2:45:06] bobthegoblin_: @frege2k he doesnt need to gain anything by explaining to his community why hes removed
[2:45:06] Steely97x: not yet
[2:45:06] Senzn_: TL:DR for this? i just tuned in
[2:45:07] mysthess: what happpened
[2:45:08] shizzon: making this video isnt the move if hes trying to reconcile, imo
[2:45:08] frege2k: talk off stream and sort it out
[2:45:09] AsdOfc: @frege2k i wouldnt be quick to judge. Theyre all streamers and very public with team related stuff, jellys name missing on stream in the roster etc. Nothing said here is even that wild
[2:45:11] abezy_burner: wait waht happened?
[2:45:13] 00ZZEE: Thats true tbh, the actions they took were overkill no matter how jelly acted
[2:45:14] dskamin29: i was kidding soorry
[2:45:14] Blaze150000: DRama baby drama
[2:45:16] Knozyr: @Explicitiz buff sub rogue?
[2:45:16] lacknothing: The community shouldnt slate any of them, only try get them to talk because of how loved they are as a team
[2:45:16] amtrash112: damn tensei lost first round
[2:45:18] OGBeads: @crylztv imagine the move wins, and jelly is therefore screwed out of 10k. shake hands my ass
[2:45:19] waitimdesyncd: jelly got kicked from the move
[2:45:19] fatulina: it not live but he is watching ur stream, so he knows we talking about
[2:45:22] MikeScharl: but its more about being friends thats why he is so upset
[2:45:23] bobthegoblin_: @frege2k mate theres nothing to talk about if he doesnt want to be friends with them anymore
[2:45:24] YUNG_AYAZ: bro is on starting soon screen and has 800 viewers wtf
[2:45:25] prikaze: lontar farmed absterge lol
[2:45:26] aframpp: That druid switch today was so good
[2:45:28] Vossie1990: Can you really talk out the fact that you got kicked from a professional team tho? Thats like your friend getting you fired from your job
[2:45:30] Alexiusblack: imagine to take first place whit shadow
[2:45:33] emergence_fi: yea thats wild
[2:45:35] St0nedCan00k: yeah
[2:45:35] MikeScharl: YEAH 100% thats the point
[2:45:38] fredslfm: Bruh why you all want Whaazz to react? Go watch it yourself if you're that interested
[2:45:40] Slapshot888: Bridge is Burned
[2:45:41] frege2k: @bobthegoblin_ then why bring it up on stream
[2:45:42] M4dmanGG: They must have had several episodes?
[2:45:44] emergence_fi: but ofc we might not know all details
[2:45:44] infernion: That has happened many times on EU tho?? Certain people kicking other players from qualified teams without a talk?
[2:45:46] OGBeads: complete immaturity is how
[2:45:49] ayjayzz: yeah they clearly had a unanimous vote
[2:45:51] Ceribi: well he said it was 2 days before the tourney
[2:45:51] bobthegoblin_: @frege2k to explain what happened to his viewers, wdym why
[2:45:53] zyberfaze: the real sadness is they might be happily living unknowning lives, because thats the immature way of a lot of boymen.   NOW IM NOT saying that there isnt more to this story , im just saying that i agree this has been handled very immaturely by the move and it adds up with the vibe i have about them as a team from streams.  But yeh the real truth is inbetween both versions
[2:45:54] cubz10: point of no coming back
[2:45:55] cubz10: tf
[2:45:56] 00ZZEE: strege is not gonna say anything, he is too troll to talk about serious stuff
[2:45:57] YUNG_AYAZ: they need to chill for like 2 days think about shit and then talk it out
[2:45:59] Knozyr: @infernion dude they've been a team for years, you should know it
[2:46:00] dskamin29: true after 5 years of being on a team to not have a sitdown ...
[2:46:01] bobthegoblin_: he said theyre too scared to speak up
[2:46:02] llDakaill: thats why Esports Org havfe psicologhist
[2:46:03] lokum17: @infernion scum move
[2:46:03] Betaxrofl: hes now on 1k veiwers haha
[2:46:03] sarent02: @infernion yeah but they played for years
[2:46:06] MikeScharl: AND THATS Why he is so upset
[2:46:07] maybethistimepls: you're just right in the head, others are not
[2:46:08] chrisiirc: there is more to this story 100%
[2:46:09] MikeScharl: i feel him
[2:46:11] imyoungdraco: NA teams have had similar problems before liquid removed trill for like a week or something once right
[2:46:18] Blaze150000: 10000% we dont know everything
[2:46:20] MikeScharl: yes
[2:46:23] bobthegoblin_: @tichoka bro ur a fkin weirdo
[2:46:24] Ceribi: @infernion they are the longest standing roster tho
[2:46:24] hongerlapp: isnt it crazy u can remove someone from a qualified team?
[2:46:28] b1det: theres more to this story 100%
[2:46:31] Betaxrofl: asmon gonna react to this :X
[2:46:33] aframpp: Has to be other reasons there's no way the whole story is 'I was grumpy so they kicked me'
[2:46:33] heisnberg94: Thats why EU is better then NA, eu cares more about your comrades
[2:46:34] graphicashen: wait what happened?
[2:46:35] keeeptryin: @tichoka weird ass comment
[2:46:35] blinkers89: thats adults that never had to be adults in their life i guess?
[2:46:38] frege2k: @bobthegoblin_ explaining is one thing but completely venting and handling it like this on stream is childish
[2:46:40] Knozyr: @tichoka wtf is wrong with you
[2:46:41] gypsywarrior: Dont they play under contracts? @Whaazz
[2:46:45] Venenu: i would just be like  NO YOU
[2:46:45] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:46:58] bobthegoblin_: @frege2k its definitely not childish, he didnt talk shit about them
[2:46:58] Blaze150000: you and raiku married ?
[2:47:03] MikeScharl: Yes
[2:47:03] painz1337: HUH
[2:47:04] locombg: Seems dramatic
[2:47:04] prikaze: ultrabull
[2:47:05] EaziG: maybe they couldnt do it when they were linked to GG
[2:47:07] cubiis: KEKW
[2:47:08] blocker94: @Lontartv y u suck on pally
[2:47:08] raylo_eu: talking shit about the BULL? monkaS
[2:47:08] ayjayzz: one door closes another door opens he clearly feeling some type of way towards them personally. maybe it’s for all their best
[2:47:09] Releaserage: D: @Lontartv
[2:47:10] frege2k: not gonna fix anything and it doesnt prove anything either, he could be lying
[2:47:13] pankdlive: @Lontartv unacceptable
[2:47:16] Fixit_cat: ULTRABULLLL
[2:47:17] Venenu: lontar is shit on pala confirmed
[2:47:17] chrisiirc: pika, carl and wiz are super reasonable so there is more to this story i think
[2:47:19] mikesteadman: ultrabull sadge
[2:47:19] Releaserage: not the bull D:
[2:47:20] fredslfm: Why is Lontar always in the example?

[2:47:21] Alexiusblack: lontar how u felling in this moment?
[2:47:22] frege2k: @bobthegoblin_ how do you know he's telling the truth?
[2:47:23] Betaxrofl: you always bash raiku XD
[2:47:26] bobthegoblin_: @frege2k mate hes explaining to his own viewers not making a PSA
[2:47:26] Eridaisback: yo @Lontartv you stink on your paladin, said by Whazz WutFace
[2:47:27] sinseh7: whazz taking any chance to roast the ultrabull
[2:47:29] lokum17: THE BEST
[2:47:31] waitimdesyncd: @Lontartv  you gotta call him whazzabi after that
