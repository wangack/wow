[3:15:22] TarMonA: mybe +5 be 2nd one beside single 35.. but i have no need for anima atm
[3:15:36] PoppaShot: dont worry @Towelliee i did a 15 SD and got 35 anima it felt amazing LUL

[3:16:40] Gitzu123: M+ has been gutted completely, worse item lvl loot and no drops, no point to run for loot, just if you enjoy running dungeons
[3:16:41] hunterxp: yep
[3:16:42] TheUnknowing: Yeah well IO and a challenge isnt very fun @Affiiance least not for me, i rather raid to get a challenge
[3:16:43] grizzlyhorn: it doesnt feel good to get less loot that is worse than heroic/normal loot
[3:16:58] ZetherTV: agree with u

[3:17:06] hunterxp: KEKW
[3:17:15] ClutchKladdkaka: truth
[3:17:20] ryte1676: no loot this whole expac :(
[3:17:27] TheUnknowing: or just up the loot in m+ a bit
[3:17:28] gutzkun: ive done necrotic like 10 times for the bow and nothing feels bad
[3:17:30] PAX1US: I fucking hate it, i've done more than 10 m+ this week and zero loot
[3:17:31] MrAJLaycock: @Towelliee I think my longest streak was 4 Mythics, then I got a ring I already had.
[3:17:36] Affiiance: Im not doing it just for the loot though, its not the main focus of the dungeon
[3:17:37] hunterxp: LUL
[3:17:37] Necrottics: Yeh I had that a few weeks ago on my rogue. Went 10 Ms without a piece of loot. It was soo fucking demoralising.
[3:17:38] Auru: no reason for drops to be so low when the ilvl was nerfed
[3:17:52] Shrenko: I have allways like grinding
[3:17:53] akia03: is bliz just scared people will be bis to fast and stop playing till 9.1 with this lootsystem?
[3:17:54] Bugszy: lol
[3:17:54] PvtHudson093: I havent bothered doing M+ at all this season
[3:17:56] djblountz: Hey @towelliee you got a nice hair cut their! I was hoping you could talk about the viewer heroic CN raid in your title? Was hoping to have a chance to join you, wasn’t sure how u r deciding who goes. Love the stream and hope I could possibly get the chance to join this community in the raid!
[3:17:57] TheItalianStallion321: totally agree, completely dissatisfying to run keys all day
[3:18:06] TarMonA: lol i got +6 key i need to do
[3:18:10] TheCliffyShow: I love when Towelliee does that voice.
[3:18:10] SuperHaxx: you yourself said sanguine but went halls :P
[3:18:10] im_charisma_: @Towelliee how do you get that mouse tracker?
[3:18:15] hunterxp: Like you said, it's just for the vault loot.
[3:18:31] TarMonA: 205 rip me
[3:18:38] MrAJLaycock: -Cries in 195-
[3:18:42] ryanagg: i'm 198 :/
[3:18:50] TarMonA: i am at 182 FeelsBadMan
[3:18:53] MuttonChopins: thats why I usually just do my 10 dungeons each week and be done with it, I feel like you get your BiS more in vault than doing M+ all day
[3:18:53] Gitzu123: i just run a couple dungeons for fun every day and if i get loot thats cool, but going to m+ looking for loot is just a recipe for disapointment
[3:19:19] djblountz: Hahaha that’s what I like to hear my wife and I tuned in for ur release stream a lot and you got the cutest dog
[3:19:22] mrelgaato: @im_charisma_ https://wago.io/Hklr0dCdf
[3:19:24] YeeniePunk: My friend is still using a 150 weapon has yet to get an upgrade to drop :<
[3:19:28] MuttonChopins: I think its Ultimate Mouse Cursor @im_charisma_
[3:19:30] MrAJLaycock: @Towelliee I feel you. Each time I have pugged NORMAL... we failed at Lady.
[3:19:30] Clicklesly: Shriekwing is basically the same on HC though?
[3:19:31] viciosomoe: @Towelliee sup bro how your prot paladin
[3:19:33] Fuzzymatty: Keying should reward towards a token you can redeem for a piece of gear so you don’t have 10 m+ a week with absolutely nothing but 350 anima
[3:19:34] 0doz: @towelliee is weird they have MDI but feels M+ doesnt matter right now...just for weekly vault
[3:20:11] im_charisma_: @mrelgaato thank you
[3:20:16] MrAJLaycock: @CostelloTV Agreed.
[3:20:20] mrelgaato: @MrAJLaycock np m8
[3:20:24] MrAJLaycock: @Towelliee Rare drop.
[3:20:29] Shrenko: yep pugging right now is a nightmare
[3:21:07] MuttonChopins: yeah just do your 10 M+ dungeons and be done with it really, not worth doing them all day imo
[3:21:58] qtceef: shriek is exactly the same
[3:22:08] AnbraxasGames: Yout totally off cigs and just vape now?
[3:22:10] MrAJLaycock: I got a Heroic CN item from my "Do one Mythic +2
[3:22:17] MrAJLaycock: One mythic+
[3:22:26] MrAJLaycock: Loot is so weird right now.
[3:22:29] FoggyBere: shriekwing is cool as hell, classic raid boss concept, Huntsman has just enough for people to go "I do what when?"
[3:23:11] MuttonChopins: Denathirus is a really fun boss imo
[3:23:31] MrAJLaycock: I really think WoW needs to take a step back from just throwing mechanic after mechanic. Put less mechanics in but make them far more deadly and important.
[3:25:24] FoggyBere: does ring of peace break prideful?
[3:25:32] Lunarsear: hey towelliee how you doing today man

[3:57:14] Aquadriel: think even emissary chests give renown

[4:03:11] JeemTeam: if they do soemthing for one addon they will have to do it across the board

[4:03:18] pavepawns: it still seems like a kid throwing a fit the situation

[4:08:55] idenkaz_: people are frustrated because Blizard makes rules and at the same time seem to not care about it at all. Its clearly stated that its not allowed yet everyone gets a free pass on addons behind a paywall. Thats why people shout not because he is a dick.

[4:10:08] MrGattz: zygors is still $10/mo
[4:10:15] MuttonChopins: I thought Zygors
[4:10:26] MrGattz: even multiboxing software was $15/mo
[4:10:27] MuttonChopins: I thought Zygors guide was a scam back in the day LUL
[4:10:52] Camo_J: Camo_J subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 3 years hammers up

[4:12:18] MuttonChopins: aap sucks and its broken for Classic WoW
[4:12:51] MuttonChopins: aap is great for retail though
[4:13:09] MrGattz: @Aquadriel what? zygor has 6700 guides built in for every achievement, every mount, every pet and every quest in the game. aap is great for just questing but its not a guide by any means
[4:13:14] SaDos: @Towelliee that puzzle is very simple.. less than 10 seconds
[4:13:24] Thoreya: i havent heard the letters BFA in a long time loll

[4:13:42] Aquadriel: MrGattz oh lol didnt know they had so much shit, iwas mostly thinking about lvling (is the only thing i torrented zygor for back in the day)
[4:13:51] Fiirkan: @TheSaintStreams There's an addon for auto turn in, I believe it's called auto turn in.
[4:14:02] StayingOccupied: i used it and worked great to not skip quests before you hit an area
[4:14:02] MrGattz: @Aquadriel ahh gotcha, yeah its changed quite a bit :P
[4:14:06] byrdeen45: if they charge for addons im going add on free cant offord to get them
[4:14:14] DBMambo: Do I brew on pull or get some stacks first?
[4:14:15] Aquadriel: thats pretty nice gatzz

[4:14:19] Aquadriel: gattz*
[4:14:21] StayingOccupied: yeah had to toggle
[4:14:24] TarMonA: it help out if you not a tank person.. i can get from 10-50 in about 13 hour
[4:14:49] MrGattz: @Aquadriel its really nice but its still not worth $10/mo. i dont use the features that often unless im bored at the end of an xpac
[4:14:54] HighlordTrazim: @Towelliee I see you feel the same as I do about torghast
[4:15:31] Fiirkan: I enjoy Torghast, but I fee it should offer some sort of reward other then soul ash.

[4:17:46] pavepawns: the reward from the anduin quest is twisting corridors
[4:17:50] Toalandry: two weeks?

[6:30:59] yeaahyeah: start of the xpack pugs will always be worse because its still the tourists and hype beast playing

[6:31:22] lithium364: we see in 9.1 if the next raid is gonna be even harder on normal and heroic
[6:31:28] BearOfLight: I've had 1 good pug. 1 shot every boss up to counsel, then both tanks needed to go and things got sad.
[6:31:40] Buckwink: I'd be okay with that tbh
[6:31:58] Kinghorn: week 1 our guild ran out of time to kill sire on normal so I pugged it and we 3 or 4 shot it
[6:32:01] Aidler: sad. I can only do pugs
