[1:06:36] Okri24: Unless they make it that you have to connect a M/K to the Xbox to play
[1:06:41] gosu836: Unless they squish powers to fit a controller but other games like FF14 are capable to be played on console
[1:06:47] Yagr6: in before m+ groups ask if you using controller or not
[1:06:49] Screamnsteam: controller works but its not optimal it all

[1:07:15] loragheta: even .1% is too generous @MilesKG21
[1:07:22] Tabarat_TV: but you cant tell me wow with ff14 controller settings
[1:07:26] Deggon: can i get a permit to link the blizzard person who says he has inside info on the console release
[1:07:26] dalvynthedrunk: Maybe Microsoft wants a big console game they own since Sony basically has ff14, I mean they have ESO but WoW is obviouslt way bigger
[1:07:29] Tabarat_TV: wouldnt  be nice
[1:07:30] gosu836: but you can plug mouse and keyboard on an xbox

[1:08:56] Thyfatman89: i wish they had a wow server that wouldn't allow addons, that'd be fun
[1:09:00] moa285: LULW
[1:09:09] Odinslayer: maybe they'll do a whole ui revamp to suit it just like 14 does
[1:09:10] RealMelorandor: I want WoW to come to Linux natively before consoles
[1:09:11] bumpstock75: tom tom is MUST in this game
[1:09:17] Deggon: can a mod give me permission to post the link for wow console person who has inside info
[1:09:17] t_train_va: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRyM8Qzxqn0
[1:09:18] not_pr0: they could probably allow addons
[1:09:25] t_train_va: Guy did M+20 using controller
[1:09:27] MILESkg21: the RP'ers Kappa
[1:09:29] swordart_19: I don't use any addons for any qol and if you need addons for quests you are lost case LUL.
[1:09:30] Qwik: Interesting takes on the possibility.
[1:09:30] not_pr0: most are just cosmetic lua
[1:09:30] onskapow: and if you don't have a pc guess what microsoft double dips
[1:09:31] t_train_va: Wasn't perfection, but still did it
[1:09:39] Deggon: ff14/eso
[1:09:39] dalvynthedrunk: There arent many console mmos in general
[1:09:40] lalelusa: "gamers were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should"
[1:09:43] Sielu11628: Do you like the new affix for 9.2?
[1:09:45] mikejames01: eso no add on on xbox
[1:09:45] akia03: without adons the raids would be nerfed hard
[1:09:50] Screamnsteam: Runescape with runelite EZ
[1:09:54] TheUnknowing: they'd have to integrate them some how within the game itself
[1:09:55] Okri24: People will say that Fallout has addons now, but again not an MMORPG
[1:09:56] The_Farting_Spaniard: Doesnt FF not even allow addons? Any addons you do are against TOS?
[1:09:59] TheGaoSora: I mean there's plenty of people with motoric problems who feel more comfortable using a controller, it will make the game much more accessible for them
[1:10:06] Layercake: Xbox has full support for mouse and keyboard  HahaThink
[1:10:06] gvandaly: i dont know if it will be a good game on console but i will defenetly whant to test that since most of classes have 3-4 button rotations
[1:10:09] Lanthor: The problem would be addon distribution on console, who is paying for that because sony are tight as hell with normal updates without including 3rd party addons
[1:10:11] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee im not even sure wow can even be played. the apm is way higher in wow than FFXIV for example.
[1:10:15] TheUnknowing: its a lot of work for little gain
[1:10:24] Odinslayer: ff14 doesn't need addons though the ui has everything needed
[1:10:29] ekkiz: but you can make them pay for it EZ
[1:10:59] Deggon: @Towelliee excatly, i was that way for ff14 and eso both, started out on console and then moved to pc cause it was just more comfortable to me
[1:11:08] Screamnsteam: @Odinslayer Kappa
[1:11:13] MILESkg21: ekkiz dont give em ideas Kappa
[1:11:16] not_pr0: new xboxs are pretty much just pcs tbh see no reason thry cant build around having near native support for them
[1:11:26] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:11:26] RealMelorandor: Cheer200 I want WoW to get Linux native client first before they ever get console support
[1:11:29] Skylin3r: sup
[1:11:34] Samurai3434: I can already picture the fat finger controller Lusts
[1:11:36] MILESkg21: SKY towHAMUP

[1:12:51] gvandaly: what u farm this for?
[1:12:53] Colt_Engineer: @Skylin3r huh, never new
[1:13:10] Armdel: they have probably been in meetings most of the last 2 days about this stuff
[1:13:10] iammrknowitall: For instance Sony has marketing rights for CoD which means it literally can't come to Game Pass for X amount of time after release
[1:13:13] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee you realize mike ybera just subscirbed to you
[1:13:19] flebbooo: WC3 Reforged on XBOX KEKW

[1:13:54] porowozek: Arcanum!
[1:14:04] dracullus: Pharaoh will get remake around this year
[1:14:05] dyslexican1: Im an IT guy and sure Linux has its uses but aint no one ever guna make games for Linux. I know dude who use it that have been calling for games on Linux for years. And there is just no reason why anyone would bother to do it. I don;t get it.

[1:18:09] BaldBroGaming: Fable isn't a failure, Microsofts handling of the IP is a failure
[1:18:13] cahoots82: Kingdoms of Amalur was meant to be an MMO as well, before they turned into a single player game

[1:24:54] dyslexican1: I don;t think its good for the wow channel to stream all the time. Another game I lay does that, and they eat up all the viewers from other streamers, and it is unhealthy for those streaming channels.
[1:25:00] geokouts: they started beta Google games on Win 11 in HK, Taiwan and South Korea
[1:25:05] luckfore: hope they return to Twitch soon
[1:25:08] Specsifier: if the fact you all are aware it'd be bad to have devs stream, maybe we as a community should work to fix that

[2:24:32] shuey23: it's very goood it will make these 2 year dungeons fresh again. i asume all routes will change
[2:24:33] raldrik: wonder if that will open up some new comps in MDI
[2:24:41] xXSiebzehnXx: They actually thought about the placement slootGasm
[2:25:03] Korupcija_: dude this will be Pog
[2:25:06] mrrazputin: depending on where they will be position it might give realy stupid routs to get the buff when you want it... like pride...
[2:25:08] KaisenSiru: Pog
[2:25:10] h00rayforstuff: @xMortal_Wombatx Tazavesh split in to two dungeons for M+
[2:25:16] Thoreya: shits gonna be crazy lol
[2:25:30] ItsXolten: with lust too gonna be nuts
[2:25:30] xXSiebzehnXx: Sometimes you can see they’re trying to push you to use different pathing, doesn’t seem like that’s what they did. I like
[2:25:31] KragnosWoW: is it worth gearing a new alt right now or will next patch make it so much easier
[2:25:32] xMortal_Wombatx: @xMortal_Wombatx But no completely new dungeon?
[2:25:38] Yagr6: and lust LUL
[2:25:43] h00rayforstuff: probably not
[2:25:50] ItsXolten: probably not
[2:25:54] h00rayforstuff: tormentors aren't
[2:25:57] ItsXolten: They aren't in 9.1
[2:26:00] xMortal_Wombatx: Oof...
[2:26:00] Korupcija_: just key level
[2:26:01] CaptainAlkohol: seasonals almost never are affected by any affixes towel
[2:26:04] Mecabeast: they're probably immune to aoe like explosive
[2:26:08] xXSiebzehnXx: The first one will be used on a massive initial group and list for boss
[2:26:11] h00rayforstuff: that's Dratnos
[2:26:15] xXSiebzehnXx: Because chances are they don’t stack
[2:26:16] Fugazi811: No Dratnos tanks
[2:26:34] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  dratnos is the dh tank jack is healing xyro is the mage
[2:26:34] xXSiebzehnXx: Unless they purposefully made them to stack with lust for tyrannical

[2:28:03] h00rayforstuff: almost certainly going to do the haste one unless you need the skip
[2:28:08] CaptainAlkohol: 10 seconds of CDR is just way too bad
[2:28:13] Mecabeast: it'd probably good for dhs and unholy dks
[2:28:16] Yagr6: mayb others are too weak
[2:28:17] onous_: Going to be great for pallies.
[2:28:19] xXSiebzehnXx: Either replace it or buff the others
[2:28:23] Korupcija_: BFA music DansGame
[2:28:39] Wcvechten: Microsoft Dungeon Tools Kappa
[2:28:51] h00rayforstuff: The CD reduction is worse than the priest fae guardians lol
[2:28:55] xXSiebzehnXx: I think CDR at 50 percent would make it more feasible
[2:28:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it's called mythic dungeon tools now
[2:29:08] SonofHorus82: @towelliee the MS buy has me reconsidering getting back into WoW. Hammer Squad still going strong in TBC?
[2:29:16] magemaster225: seems like a less terrible version of last seasons affix
[2:29:30] xXSiebzehnXx: Because then the CDR would effect something like using meta next pack and boss
[2:29:31] onous_: Vent pallie 100% next patch right?
[2:29:33] DaLawII: good morning Towelliee and folks!
[2:30:13] jarilrpg: i could see in pugs just always killing Wo first

[5:02:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: difference is eso is a free game with a sub option WoW may see a different approach because the sub is required
[5:02:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: but who knows
[5:03:06] bioreducto: spartan is going to be the next class for wow lol
[5:03:14] firekingkyle: ESO hasnt even had enough time since the buyout(merge) to change. We will see next chapter if there are any telling signs of change.
[5:03:58] MFKnightS: theres no reason to change it it works
[5:03:59] dalaraz: wow is the 1 staying out
[5:04:02] Slots1Up: microsoft gonna let wow die
[5:04:09] grandmatb: @Slots1Up LOL
[5:04:11] Poriand: overwatch 2 will 100% be on game pass
[5:04:14] bioreducto: they can a least add the expansion to game pass
[5:04:21] Templexx: technically ea is involved in xbox game pass stuff too.
[5:04:22] MILESkg21: Slots1Up LMAO WHAT EleGiggle
[5:04:23] Havoc_S1: There’s a big update on eso on the 27th
[5:04:27] Sollice: PC Game Pass +- PC Game pass plus Wo W sub $20
[5:04:30] GlobalWarming: if wow gets added to game pass that just means more mounts and transmogs in the in game shop :(
[5:04:33] Heero_Effect: @slots1up  isn’t WoW already dead? KappaClaus

[5:05:00] bioreducto: without having to pay for it rhough
[5:05:02] Templexx: yea reinvent the wheel with purchasing id say. esp cuz its been around forever
[5:05:02] Naturalbeef: Adding Wow to the Game Pass and expanding the Store might be more profitable
[5:05:06] ElPolloBatman: redridge mountains will be renamed to redmond mountains
[5:05:10] Templexx: dont*
[5:05:15] ZakuzaGB: im assuming by now you have, did you see that bobby wanted to buy pc gamer to stop them talkin shizz haha
[5:05:20] Kelsillium: There won't be any changes to the subscription model, but there might be changes to how the game plays, just like every expansion brings changes, although if microsoft decides on any changes it won't be until mid way through next expansion or the one after
[5:05:21] bioreducto: though*
[5:05:32] Mecabeast: if anything you'd see like halo added to the bnet launcher
[5:05:35] firekingkyle: Don't think people understand that we wont see the Microsoft effect till at least 2024
[5:05:42] dalaraz: they dont have to change the bnet app,just make the games accessible on game pass too
[5:05:48] Kavieonn: Add Wow to the Xbox, like Final Fantasy is on the playstation
[5:05:51] Kavieonn: xD
[5:05:53] MILESkg21: thats delusional
[5:06:02] Collected1: i'm more concerned about where this engine change is coming from etc. we need upgrades.
[5:06:04] enigma_3031: looking to get back into WoW after 2 and half years. in your opinion would you pick up where you left off or start fresh on a new server.

[5:06:12] Evilbreed83: i just want a flying windows logo mount
[5:06:14] Dookeyy: maybe new engine? lol
[5:06:15] piratechris: It would be easier for Microsoft to make their own MMO than make WoW into Wowsoft LUL
[5:06:15] MFKnightS: there will still be a wow team an they will make the content.....
[5:06:16] vadder_fister: ybarra
[5:06:16] xideontv: not 10.0 but maybe 11.0 /wow 2

[5:06:21] Shrenko: just look at ESO... Microsoft havent changed anything with it
[5:06:21] thiccsushi: Microsoft isn't going to do anything other than collect cheques and ask whats going on once in awhile
[5:06:22] Slots1Up: you really think Microsoft Cares about wow @Towelliee
[5:06:25] Eraste: at this rate, they probably know better than the actual devs KEKW
[5:06:26] vandervalor: ya but people at wow dont even care
[5:06:28] magemaster225: does it count if its ybarra making the changes?

[5:06:44] tebbix: That's gotta be a troll
[5:06:50] dalaraz: not even activision could affect wow gameplay,why would microsoft do it lol
[5:06:52] tehrobtar: watching this chat is like watching some belular bullshit xDD
[5:06:55] MangoSoldier: a banshee as amount

[5:07:02] ZakuzaGB: the most effect they will ahve is on staffing/time frames etc?
[5:07:03] firekingkyle: Microsoft bought Blizzard because of the dram/allegations making the price lower. They know they can make money and fix the culture, in turn helping the content.

[5:07:23] tehrobtar: i'm wheezing
[5:07:23] Kavieonn: Archeage killing wow next patch
[5:07:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: only thing activision influences over blizzard is deadlines
[5:07:26] Scoodles91: the "magical"kind :D
[5:07:27] piratechris: No Activision made demands of WoW making money not content.. jeez
[5:07:28] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @Towelliee the only changes i see is maybe wow gets boxes like elder scrolls  has and more stream drops
[5:07:30] ElPolloBatman: i assume microsoft will let developers be, but overall want to clean up the sexual misconduct and harrassment issues. might as well raise wages to industry standard or give some other bonuses, like planning ahead and cutting crunch as much as possible. a bonus would be if some companies could take on franchies of others to squeeze in smaller games that might as well be game pass exclusive
[5:07:31] cabalish: !mod
[5:07:40] ZakuzaGB: i think people are trying to talk about time gating and stuff being all activisions influence
[5:07:42] Autoexeq: People thinking this transaction is like Disney acquiring Marvel LUL LUL
[5:07:42] MILESkg21: behind you monkaS
[5:07:43] ninedraft317: It’s a full moon
[5:07:50] LunarbladeDK: i haven't see microsoft going ham and changing anything in the games - they have been adding to the development of the games - mentioning minecraft - they have made massive changes in the tempo of the updates and the quality, but they haven't changed the game at all
[5:07:52] PvtHudson093: its not like any normal water
[5:07:54] DarkenedHour97: Activision and TenCent 100% advocate for more paid trasactions
[5:07:56] Wildside1177: Should MS ever want to influence how wow plays, they will assign people with the experience they prefer to WoW. They would be insane to interject directly.
[5:07:57] axellent_x: free wow xpac with next purchase of windows 11
[5:07:59] maddi_: @Towelliee here is my take on that. if the current higher ups in the company is obsessed with daily logins because some data says that's good, but if microsoft doesn't think that is so vital to revenue, it can influence things like obscene korthia grinds and things that make people not want to play wow
[5:07:59] OhNoNotAgain: delusium
[5:08:00] Kavieonn: What happened to archage? i remember thinking that game was gonna be the shizz
[5:08:02] PokerFaceMoose: theyd do it indirectly. it would be affected by who they hire, due dates, and the work environment
[5:08:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: dumbassery
[5:08:03] Naturalbeef: School out today?
[5:08:05] lalelusa: nopium
[5:08:06] Kisswani: I inhale Idiom Kappa
[5:08:10] ventu105: @Towelliee is BM a good choice for range dps?
[5:08:12] Squirrel_nutty: its an illusion, what are you hiding
[5:08:12] Kelsillium: Influencing gameplay =/= direct involvement in development
[5:08:13] Shoebacca28: @Piratechris you cannot know that. We have no idea what Activision have influenced and what they ahve not
[5:08:14] MILESkg21: school must be out early
[5:08:17] Tzarrus: I'm not going to say things will change, but I hope (hopium) that things will change for the better and make the game more enjoyable again you know
[5:08:32] ElPolloBatman: call from phil spencer: ion, buff ferals, or else...
[5:08:35] Kavieonn: Microsoft didn't do much to minecraft?
[5:08:43] Ezcotli: chat prophets
[5:08:46] JarJar_Brinkz: WoW is #3 and has potential to be 1.. They arent gonna let it slip
[5:08:47] Slots1Up: @Towelliee while i dont know future, but u realize microsoft have to clean house in blizz right
[5:08:48] israuribe96tw: call of duty candry crush wow

[5:09:18] JackedDown: KEKW
[5:09:18] piratechris: @Shoebacca28 Well put it this way. It is way more, like 10x more likely that Activision made demands of return on investment rather than specific content, lore etc

[5:10:17] TheStarhammer: @Towelliee Most of what we saw the past six months was about how WoW was doomed for all the obvious reasons. We get this great news that MICROSOFT is buying AActivision/Blizzard, getting rid of Bobby Kotick and ALL the naysayers still want to whine. THIS is the best news for Blizzard in a LONG time. Thanks for staying postitive, Towelliee.

[5:11:18] Naturalbeef: The token will be even better. Exchange gold for the MS Game Pass
[5:11:18] Vivelli: what is even happening with chat and these takes today
[5:11:18] Heero_Effect: What’s wrong with the WoW token? If I need some gold and don’t have time to farm shit easy $20 200k gold move on
[5:11:22] Kavieonn: Imagine they dont get rid of upper management and get rid of all the other workers
[5:11:23] superdoekiller: so as someone that is thinking about starting WOW... any advice @Towelliee

You can frame it however you like but I still think Activisions influence has created some shitty systems which essentially just make it so that you have to play the game longer. Thats a shitty way to be designing systems and mechanics

[5:15:57] GlobalWarming: after 9.1.5 a lot of the tbc streamers came back to retail
[5:15:58] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[5:16:04] RalgorStreams: Actuallly I think all the raids have been pretty good
[5:16:07] thiccsushi: Nathria was a good raid besides SLG cause fuck that boss on mythic it just lasted too long
[5:16:12] Kavieonn: Warlords of Dreanor was the best wow expansion, don't care what nobody says
[5:16:17] Fredster134: i really didn't like Castle
[5:16:17] ZakuzaGB: the first few month of 9.0 as someone that likes m+ was good then from then till now its been trash
[5:16:22] Dcarter: the raids i have been meh

[5:16:36] dewking93: Will covenant lvl go above 80 in 9.2?
[5:16:48] Ertra: @dewking93 nope renown stops at 80
[5:16:53] Dcarter: both fights are like that
[5:16:56] Wcvechten: Sylvanas was such a shit fight lmao
[5:16:56] Heero_Effect: I mean it’s a video game. Play until you aren’t having fun lol
[5:17:04] snackbacon: the downstairs phase on Sire was intense
[5:17:14] Dcarter: everypart until the last part
[5:17:16] its_andyd: i think once i go down on u its an amazing encounter
[5:17:26] thiccsushi: The last part of Denathrius was the most fun for me in mythic
[5:17:28] Eraste: i preferred p1 over p2
[5:17:30] Dcarter: so you go thru like 10m of the fight only to get to the good part
[5:17:32] ZakuzaGB: either that or just make the phase good and internesting haha
[5:17:33] Dcarter: drives me nuts
[5:17:37] grapyz: p2 could be scrapped imo p1 and p3 are fineà
[5:17:38] pronkk_: how are we oging to solo mythic sylanus in 11.0 @Towelliee ?
[5:17:51] H0bbitK1ng: p1 and p3 sylv were good, just the gauntlet was too long
[5:17:59] Slots1Up: @Towelliee  whit wow also - the thing is now the comunuty micro analysingz EVERYTHNG whit a negative tone. vs the older days

[5:18:21] pacificmc1: Blizz devs = a lot of words, little action
[5:18:37] dwyanewade23: end of expansion boss should be 15min
[5:18:37] Eraste: i felt that when i came back to WoW during antorus. Fights felt so long and boring (on heroic)
[5:18:37] pacificmc1: actually nvm, little words, little action
[5:18:41] Templexx: maybe tuning?
[5:18:42] viraal2784: same with me thinking "tomorrow i will clean my house"
[5:18:45] H0bbitK1ng: they said back then that end bosses were different
[5:18:48] GlobalWarming: their biggest issue is they think they have to reinvent themselves everytime
[5:19:01] Collected1: LUL
[5:19:01] Bayne77: imagine how long these fights would be if they werent trying to pare them down to 10 minutes
[5:19:03] Collected1: its like a loop
[5:19:05] MILESkg21: and yet every expansion is ALT FRIENDLY EleGiggle
[5:19:14] Collected1: make mistake, fix the mistake, make the same mistake again, fix the same mistake again
[5:19:14] cbiskit89: darts on a board
[5:19:16] Templexx: dart board
[5:19:19] Collected1: it's just a ploy to sell expansions
[5:19:20] Screamnsteam: Ion is bobby koticks lawyer EZ
[5:19:21] FresheFefe: cut a chickens head
[5:19:27] JarJar_Brinkz: @GlobalWarming thats due to the fact that no one in this community knows how to give real feedback LUL
[5:19:28] Eraste: yup, staying unsubbed until they can release an expansion in a quality state
[5:19:46] Xanigh: or mby they panic cauäse they can't come up with that one thing that's good
[5:19:54] rensdeamo: Yh - also they've said many times that 2 yrs between expansions is too long - what happens
[5:20:02] rensdeamo: MS will change thatr
[5:20:16] Slots1Up: @Towelliee i see a future whree ino gone soon . under his watch everthing wack
[5:20:22] thiccsushi: Ghostcrawler was awesome with his dev cooler posts
[5:20:28] tebbix: @dosetsu2 True
[5:20:29] firekingkyle: The word of "Its a bad expc" spreads faster then if "Its a good expc". So why not fix it....
[5:20:33] dorfcock: 2 years 100%
[5:20:37] cbiskit89: 2 years is fine as long as they put out patches regularly in between

[5:20:47] Justyy52: with the good expansion indeed
[5:21:01] PokerFaceMoose: 1 year expacs just means you get 10, 10.1, then you are on to 11
[5:21:02] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL LUL LUL
[5:21:03] thiccsushi: I wouldn't mind a 3 year expac if they just make it good
[5:21:04] rensdeamo: Its a matter of double develloping - 1 team doing progress
[5:21:06] SinicalDev: Blizz just need to iterate on features not just kill them if they dont work out. Garrisons/Player housing would be amazing with 8 years of iteration
[5:21:08] cahoots82: What is this "common sense" you speak of?
[5:21:13] Ldysansa: NO one wants to put out a bad product
[5:21:14] DarkenedHour97: There is two wow teams, one makes good expacs and one doesnt KEKW
[5:21:17] dalaraz: people wont return for fixed things,they just move on,its not 2010 @Towelliee
[5:21:17] dorfcock: dont they make more money from subs then they do from people buying xpack?
[5:21:18] Blackcovfefee: WoW devs just don’t know what to do. So they create systems to artificially inflate play time
[5:21:25] Mecabeast: perso ally I think you need a major patch every 3-4mos to keep things I teresting
[5:21:25] Collected1: i don't think it's intentional in that respect but i think they need a list of changes to justify people buying so they promise the world and under deliver

[6:56:21] Nokterian: twitch is doing weird not showing my hammer
[6:56:23] QMGSaint: Do you think because of the bump in viewership ffxiv has gotten recently has influenced how much content creators like it?
[6:56:30] cowee12356995: PUL
[6:56:33] cowee12356995: LUL *
[6:56:34] JarJar_Brinkz: Its also a bonus that they got the most views ever playing ffxiv for the first time LUL That definitely helps their positivity
[6:56:42] Thoreya: the viewership for FF dipped hard after like the 2nd day of the expansion
[6:56:48] Sacura_Shadow: lol story of the collector life
[6:56:48] balancedlight: their passion bubbles have been too close to the surface for too long. They both needed the vacation.
[6:56:52] Thoreya: so now its just like story reacts and thats pretty much it
[6:56:57] balanira: asmongold plays wow everyday theese days

[7:56:25] LordOverflow: How long did it take for Asmon to get that mailmuncher?
[7:56:25] AlphasaurusRexx: you have same chance of getting it every run. rarity just keeps adding that chance after every run
[7:56:26] Okri24: Not legion mounts no
[7:56:26] swordart_19: @neodorian_ rarity
[7:56:28] queeflabs: i dont think thats how the % works dude..
[7:56:37] Herzenliegen: @ghostpants5415 geeze, I got mind the minute it was available but that would suck for new players.

[7:56:41] viraal2784: for me first
[7:56:46] Nokterian: mailmuncher was very easy
[7:56:51] OmA72: wrong percentage ..... every try you start with the same percentage ... the app added the trys
[7:56:55] Ronangic: 1 in 100 chance does not mean you will get it after 100 tries... you have a 1 in 100 chance every single time you loot it
[7:56:55] Armdel: i also got the mailmuncher in less than 30

[7:57:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's like gambler's fallacy.....every attempt has the same odds
[7:57:16] PokerFaceMoose: does it mean 97% of people got it by now? lol
[7:57:20] Nokterian: Ashes of A'lar took me 10 years to get it, no joke.
[7:57:28] TheUnknowing: i got the charhound on my groups first kill lol
[7:57:33] ZakuzaGB: what you mean he drove the vindicar
[7:57:33] jaybdzn: PR OMEGALUL PHET VELEN
[7:57:40] mhelliker: rarity % is the percent of people that have killed it that many times should have it
[7:57:42] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I got the antoran charhound week 1 on my first kill. I was almost kicked from the guild.
[7:57:42] queeflabs: its saying based on the drop rate you would have a % to get it if thats the maz number of tries that guarantees a drop, but thats not how RNG works.. you have a 1 in 100 chance every kill
[7:57:43] golgothanr: YES
[7:57:44] LordOverflow: Real percentage is 50/60. 50 to get it, 50 to not get it and 10 for extra annoyance

[7:58:36] theDirtyon3: 3k gone
[7:59:06] golgothanr: the percent that is there is saying that on average about 97.55 percent of people have gotten it by this point.  That does guarantee you will get it the next time.
[7:59:10] theDirtyon3: Mythic is dumb
[7:59:17] Snabido: Add like a 'legacy debuff' by decreasing set amount of hp
[7:59:22] Herzenliegen: @nokterian I got invincible so easy but not ashes
[7:59:29] RAYvenMP: because mythix is not scale
[7:59:37] swordart_19: People do groups for it.
[7:59:51] death_cam_: its because mythic is scaled for 20 ppl and not 10
[7:59:52] swordart_19: Why make it so it does not support groups:P
[7:59:55] queeflabs: yeah basically towelliee youre one of the 2.45% who havent got it after 370 tries. sucks to be you

[8:00:56] Shuttlelol: @SpilledMelk more like they need more devs working on QA feedback
[8:01:00] mysticdarkeve: Wow is a good game but the fear of it becoming trash is real like cod
[8:01:08] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[8:01:14] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: I'd like to see them add a scale mode for old raids. Where you're scaled to the level when it was released @Towelliee
[8:01:32] School_Toilets: Personal loot
[8:01:36] luckfore: you get it automatically without looting boss
[8:01:37] swordart_19: @darkevegaming You not liking it doesn't mean it is bad for millions it is great for me as well
[8:01:39] Snabido: Add that trinket to your no drop collection
[8:01:40] chrslp: I wonder if the WoW part of blizzard is having the same issues the Overwatch part is having. Lots of Overwatch devs say OW2 delay is because execs keep having them switch to other projects that then get cancelled after months

[8:04:45] swordart_19: @queeflabs think what you want matters not to me.i will play it

[8:05:30] Rudric_Ice: @herzenliegen  prolly got paid by riot or something
[8:06:02] queeflabs: nobody said anything about not wanting to play it, but concise roadmaps and development schedules exist for a reason, and when theyre thrown out the window for what turns out to be nothing, its a shitshow. it doesnt even have a firm release date ffs
[8:06:05] swordart_19: @darkevegaming live and enjoy now , worrying about IFS is nonsense.
[8:06:17] youzeon: I’m still enjoying wow and still love it

[8:07:02] queeflabs: it isnt about it being public you goon, theres literally devs saying it TODAY
[8:07:11] cahoots82: You know what's easier? Just ignoring him and moving on from this stupid argument.
[8:07:25] swordart_19: @queeflabs dude I just agreed and said they helped with other games LUL
[8:07:34] queeflabs: literal devs saying schedujles and dev time is thrown out the window for projects not coming to fruition losing dev time on ow2.. how is that part of a roadmap ?
[8:07:37] bobbyg24k: TableHere FlipThis FlipThis
[8:07:47] swordart_19: I don't argue anything when game is done it will release have fun bye.
[8:08:08] queeflabs: so whats your argument then? if theyre being placed onm other projects.. that by their own words are then cancelled, how does that not fuck up the schedule for ow2?
[8:08:38] mysticdarkeve: I just is really dumb play on Microsoft That’s all there to big of a company as it is take Rogers communication in Canada they own a bank all of the Communication networks now because they bought shaw ripped shaws billing process apart and are trying to suing everyone ever that owned them money so i don’t see this going so well but who knows right

[8:18:32] ZakuzaGB: the real question is would you have enjoyed the mountfarming more than shadowlands :')
[8:18:33] chrslp: @crackfox48 Super unfortunate but he wasn't the main character so they'll probably continue and write him out
[8:18:50] Snomase: Did he talk about the Hpally nerfs?
[8:18:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lots of new stuff soon!
[8:18:53] Mazeltough: @chrslp oh i misread the article then i thought it was the main guy

[8:26:00] TheUnknowing: its a bit rough on mythic, i was farming the mythic set for awhile, took me like a month to complete it
[8:26:01] smashwow: corruption is dead now
[8:26:02] bobschnutts: !YT
[8:26:03] Phae__: I just now got to be able to solo this. At the beginning of 9.0, you couldn't even solo this with the harder bosses.

[8:26:48] death_cam_: if you look at it in prepatch of people doing 2-4k dps at lvl 50 since corruptions got disabled then shows how much power gain corruption gave players
[8:27:02] panzmat: you absolutely can solo KJ..
[8:27:04] Phae__: Yeah, it's brutal
[8:27:05] cahoots82: its solable now, at least on my havoc dh
