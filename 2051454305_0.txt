[0:40:34] Heisenberg: anyone got the link to the dungeon XP sheet?
[0:40:35] lizcat_: I bet kara crypts will be bigger
[0:40:37] Juubbz: 25 is the sweet spot IMO
[0:40:43] unscconnor2: jesus the dps in this group is insane
[0:40:52] only499atkfc: I like 10 mans because there’s less competition for loot
[0:40:54] DankWizard420: have you done a priestless run? pepeLaugh
[0:41:03] lizcat_: they’ll do the bigger test with the 60 content
[0:41:03] zetoaraujo: still playing this game
[0:41:07] only499atkfc: 25 would be nice if they added an extra drop from every boss
[0:41:07] Tamrock: I think 40 is too much
[0:41:18] Tamrock: 10 and 20 for SOD would be the best imo
[0:41:27] DankWizard420: 80man PauseChamp

[0:42:04] TurboBased: Peggers this 40 think you
[0:42:07] only499atkfc: 40 man end game raids will be sick, Classic must have 40 man or it’s not Classic.
[0:42:09] hebronjebron: bearbot hitting us with the deep questions
[0:42:10] Piorum_: You can probably 2-3 man this easily at 40
[0:42:12] illegalstuff: BRD lvl 50 raid, split into two sections 40man ea = 80man raid 4Head
[0:42:14] Mtruck27: Still feel like they could just make the 40 man raids 25 and not nerf/buff the bosses.  We will be so buffed it'd probably just be okay?
[0:42:47] jonv0: was BFD ever nerfed at all or is everyone just geared now?
[0:42:49] gressil1234: 40 man raids are gonna suck as warlock, you are gonna be the curse cuck unless there are 4 warlocks
[0:42:51] bald_n_gorgeous: I hope they spice it up for the 60 raids, make them harder.
[0:42:53] PhillyRhino: @StaysafeTV what are you looking forward to the most in P2?

[0:43:04] Piorum_: The need to make the 60 raids 80 player
[0:43:11] ragnof_: how do you subsitute drain life build

[0:43:58] aBradAbroad: do you have the 'whats training addon' its great for this type of stuff
[0:44:12] jonv0: 26, 30, 34/36, 40?
[0:44:56] nashonatorrr: What's Training? Add-on can help with spells
[0:44:59] Mawshaw: I think meta form is too high res for classic, should have been more like a satyr form or something
[0:45:13] sufix__: there’s a super basic addon called “what’s training?” on curse that sits as a tab in your spell book to show what’s upcoming
[0:45:17] Brenno_Mc: Just typing the same thing @nashonatorrr !
[0:45:20] Spanos_: @abradabroad what’s training is so good
[0:45:23] a_demeaning_cow: a_demeaning_cow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:45:59] TheSanguist: Depends on the length of the fight.  I do think dots critting though is going to be insane inPVP
[0:46:06] bots_bots: you could check details
[0:46:42] oof1405: is succubus best pet for warlock pve?
[0:46:44] hebronjebron: the ability doesnt refresh if pet crits before end of duration
[0:47:23] madgarlicjr: jumping increases crit chance, a lot of people don't know that
[0:47:29] Angeroth: only thing is imp trinket

[1:17:37] smoro: why health funnel?
[1:17:39] bots_bots: @Kewl__ the sheet he is looking at is using SoD mob stats and even with 1 person its faster. I have not solo'd however so i don't know whats better for that

[3:22:39] trebolz: You think humans shouldn't eat bread?
[3:22:53] thebedshow: As someone who has dieted a long time you also need to weigh every day so you can see that your weight fluctuates a lot day to day. If you only weigh once a week you may be on a high point and it is very demoralizing

[3:23:56] Mind_G0bl1n: u gotta dehydrate after you poo before weighting in
[3:23:56] GastankTV: 4k calories 300g of protein 200g of carbs a day keeps the low t andies away

[4:55:17] StaysafeTV: 72810
[4:55:19] KingDaDa1011: at a certain rep level you stop getting xp
[4:55:23] SuperLost89: i wonder if they boost the exp of these boxes in p2. maybe thats why they havent mentioned it yet. to avoid people feeling to need to farm a ton
[4:55:36] SuperLost89: the need to*
[4:56:05] Mattysaiyan: Don't you think that only the 26-40 boxes will give decent xp/rep? I really don't think these boxes are gonna do anything
[4:56:39] Iratic: can you stack wsg marks 24 hours before release
[4:56:43] Iratic: in mailbox
[4:56:46] bigsugg: you can get 15 quest mitems and jsut keep them in the bag without accepting the quests
[4:56:48] bots_bots: did u add whatever marks u will have in mail yet?
[4:56:48] spike82q: 3 marks are still 1200 xp ?  are those facored in yet
[4:56:58] Dawgnito: I thought they said you cant?
[4:56:59] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV are you adding in the exp you get from BFD?
[4:57:09] Lionkingler1: surely gonna wins lots of games during that timeframe vs those guys KEKW
[4:57:18] LuceidLevels: they wipe all marks in the mailbox at p2 launch
[4:57:24] Drivebypwned: are they taking all marks out on the 6th? even ones in bag
[4:57:29] bots_bots: seems unlikely unless u are just BOMBING wins
[4:57:30] Blohs: @StaysafeTV  They said they are deleting marks in your mailbox
[4:57:34] englishurza: they could legit purge mailboxes before launch
[4:57:38] Mattysaiyan: Marks get cleared 24h before but you can sweaty farm them from that point on based on what they have said chat
[4:57:40] KingDaDa1011: @LuceidLevels is that confirmed?
[4:57:47] FreakOutGamingChannel: 14hrs on launch?
[4:57:55] sstriife: you get 3 marks per win right ?
[4:57:56] LuceidLevels: it was blueposted somewhere
[4:57:58] spookyfrogy: that’s going to be a long night
[4:57:59] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV are you adding in the exp you get from BFD? 󠀀
[4:58:03] Lionkingler1: so you gonna stay up like 50 hours? mark grind into actual launch grind
[4:58:03] spike82q: on reset (tuesday)
[4:58:05] Iratic: only the ones you delete and try to restore
[4:58:09] sstriife: so 2 wins per hour
[4:58:09] dustydollars2121: get in a sweaty premade and you should be able to hit that
[4:58:16] sstriife: might be able to do it with a good premade
[4:58:17] KingDaDa1011: @LuceidLevels thats not what they said
[4:58:31] Mahca_: bluepost said theyre removing marks in mail on tuesday reset
[4:58:40] Snaketrap: NA the 8th?
[4:58:50] wagyu_88: I dont think the Crates give XP past revered
[4:58:50] azazu: that almost requires a !marks command :)
[4:58:51] bigsugg: i heard this story 5 tmes ;]
[4:59:18] synix55: what marks r u talking about?
[4:59:25] Mattysaiyan: The marks is for sure a solid tryhard farm
[4:59:26] xrazzaks: duddde the rod just dropped for my lock!
[4:59:27] fox0_0wolf: What are your thoughts on GDKP removal? I can't believe they're finally trying something out.
[4:59:31] KingDaDa1011: @synix55 wsg
[4:59:31] Honeypaw: lmao
[4:59:34] Mattysaiyan: They could change their mind but it is what it is
[4:59:37] englishurza: servers for p2 live at 1pm CT? or?
[4:59:41] synix55: it sounds good.. i'd like to know

[4:59:47] thaplayboy69: very good
[4:59:49] thaplayboy69: fuck gdkps
[4:59:51] dj_clerik: @StaysafeTV did they data mine what the lvl 25+ boxes are going to be? You're probably going to get a ton of them while dungeon leveling
[4:59:55] thaplayboy69: ahmpy in literal shambles rn
[5:00:02] spike82q: add in daily quests  for gold if need be
[5:00:03] fox0_0wolf: I havn't done a single GDKP. Alot of streamers gonna get butthurt.
[5:00:04] FreakOutGamingChannel: only reason im playing p2 is that change
[5:00:12] Mattysaiyan: BASED Devs for a change
[5:00:27] dj_clerik: If we knew you could try to prefarm the lvl 25+ bot mats to have those ready to turn in
[5:00:29] SuperLost89: do you think its better to run BFD at 25 in P2, or would it be better to get a few levels and then run it?
[5:00:36] KingDaDa1011: GG
[5:00:51] spike82q: bfd huge exp they said right
[5:01:01] wagyu_88: It will be worth
[5:01:03] vecowski: they said it would be worth running until 35
[5:01:12] Mahca_: planning to do 40 in 1 sitting?
[5:01:20] Utmost777: you will have 3 days ish to decide anyway
[5:01:22] TesservcT: joardee said its supposed to be close to 1 level
[5:01:22] BadGerbilLion: Could take a while to form up a 10man instead of having the 10man ready when xp opens up
[5:01:24] Honeypaw: they said it will give "significant" xp until mid 30s
[5:01:28] TesservcT: so a quick 25-26?
[5:01:38] Mattysaiyan: @TesservcT based on absolutely nothing no doubt
[5:01:50] SuperLost89: there are a couple wowhead links regarding the BFD XP Grant. it seems like each boss gives 3k, and the last boss will give 5k exp
[5:01:57] SuperLost89: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=440077/bfd-xp-grant-dnt
[5:02:00] vecowski: they explicitly said in the interview it would be worth significant xp until 35
[5:02:03] SuperLost89: if you cared to look
[5:02:07] Farenheight451: the vibe in classic is so nice
[5:02:22] SuperLost89: check the value
[5:02:25] Lionkingler1: 3001 multi?
[5:02:36] Mahca_: one says 3001 value other is 5001
[5:02:36] spike82q: at least the whole " level up raids " they reffered to the raids earlier  as is now not just talk
[5:02:36] SuperLost89: this one shows 5000 for the value https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=438382/bfd-xp-grant-dnt
[5:02:37] saronitebomb: which single rune are you least excited for?
[5:02:47] Lionkingler1: current exp times 3001

[5:03:12] SuperLost89: most likely, but that can change ofcourse
[5:03:12] rbo2992: 23000
[5:03:18] MIDASWODOTATELKI: kelris 5k too
[5:03:27] Lionkingler1: what about the trash?
[5:03:35] ticklemextreme: plus mob xp
[5:03:36] desweck: so like almost 2 levels from one run? lol
[5:03:44] NutterCircus: Not worth
[5:03:50] thaplayboy69: @NutterCircus ??
[5:03:51] bots_bots: the fuck u mean
[5:03:53] pizac7: they should just remove the raid lockout from it and make it a 10 man dungeon like UBRS
[5:03:53] thaplayboy69: a run is less than 30m
[5:03:54] Locky987: @desweck that's not even 1 level
[5:03:55] thaplayboy69: its very worth
[5:03:57] bots_bots: its 25k in 30 min
[5:03:58] NutterCircus: 1 raid every 3 days...
[5:04:01] Dawgnito: 25k exp in sub 30 min that sounds worth
[5:04:02] mattbarz989: 25k in 30 mins is good
[5:04:03] Lionkingler1: so way over 50k per hour exp
[5:04:04] dj_clerik: raid group so mob xp reduced
[5:04:09] kaiju_kin: very worth to run first night
[5:04:13] shiizampov: NEEDS A NEW PISTON
[5:04:14] seymourmoney: you're too fat
[5:04:20] Sohsuh: stop stinking
[5:04:20] SuperLost89: LOL
[5:04:21] bots_bots: @NutterCircus its 1 time 25k right on release how is that not worth
[5:04:22] mattbarz989: and if people do quest stack first going in at 26 itll take sub 20 mins
[5:04:23] Xephyr282: peepoGiggles what is it sinking about
[5:04:23] weebpulper: Peggers
[5:04:25] wookieenthal: LOL
[5:04:32] spike82q: upon completion  meaning if people 5/7 they still dont get exp?, but im just going off that leaked audio from tge video
[5:04:33] tylerificus: Clueless
[5:04:33] desweck: 25k xp + mob xp you're talking prob 35ish, that's def a level and a half
[5:04:38] Mmrgh: sstvHa
[5:04:48] bots_bots: dont count trash
[5:04:55] bots_bots: raids reduce mob xp by 95%
[5:04:57] rbo2992: about 75 trash mobs
[5:04:59] NutterCircus: compaired to 30k an hour
[5:05:00] mattbarz989: NEW CHAIR ALERT
[5:05:09] dj_clerik: @StaysafeTV trash probably won't give much since it's nerfed in raid groups
[5:05:15] tylerificus: I think its worth if you get in a pumper group
[5:05:20] kaiju_kin: new chair before p2, lock it in
[5:05:31] WHOisROXIS: 5man bfd easy
[5:05:38] mattbarz989: new chair might be bis for p2
[5:06:02] NutterCircus: You hve to consider variables like PVP, waiting for players etc.
[5:06:04] kaiju_kin: it should scale then huh
[5:06:05] bots_bots: static
[5:06:09] sargent_baddy: last boss killed = big chunk of exp
[5:06:13] bone555: So true king
[5:06:15] Mahca_: they said its good until mid 30s so not sure
[5:06:16] SuperLost89: true! its gonna scale for sure. unless they give a separate bonus exp after clearing
[5:06:17] mattbarz989: itll be so fast at 25 though
[5:06:27] mattbarz989: 35&*
[5:06:28] bone555: Nice ass
[5:06:34] shiizampov: @StaysafeTV The piston in your chair is dead AF, you need a new comp chair
[5:06:34] darkness4ghost: don't forget they also announced that you'll still get xp regardless of being "saved" which seems like they are going to add some kind of "reset" function?
[5:06:40] Mattysaiyan: Their wording makes it seem like there is more of a "completion" bonus rather than just boss xp
[5:06:55] rbo2992: gathermate
[5:07:01] handovdoom666: i'm sure the addon doesn't have that data
[5:07:03] rbo2992: check if all the chest types are on
[5:07:03] Mahca_: @Mattysaiyan thats what i thought too
[5:07:05] malefic159: import treasure on gathermate
[5:07:13] Zaziben: didnt they remove high elvel chests formt he world?
[5:07:28] mykologist: imagine winning ashenvale reset raid lockout
[5:07:37] malefic159: even if they removed them gathermate will have the locations of chests from eta
[5:07:39] malefic159: era
[5:07:39] esduewow: could be conflicting addons
[5:07:49] spike82q: and the completion bonus could scale off personal level
[5:07:57] dj_clerik: could also grab desolace while you're out there
[5:08:02] bots_bots: i tihnk its better at higher level anyway
[5:08:02] Lionkingler1: do it after turning in the quests
[5:08:05] bots_bots: u have a day or so
[5:08:11] bots_bots: to clear before that lockout goes
[5:08:14] Mahca_: any idea on what time xp will go live?
[5:08:20] imJose: i believe if you click on “gathermate” it has menus of showing if you have the profession only etc, might be wrong
[5:08:26] wagyu_88: Dont think the crates give xp past revered in P2
[5:08:44] NutterCircus: The time Variables considered with BFD you are looking at a potential 2 hour window.
[5:08:46] Mahca_: think of the run time and forming group
[5:08:46] bots_bots: cuz finding a group is kinda annoying, so really if u can slide into as the tenth guy and clear rq thats ideal
[5:08:54] kaiju_kin: your strat u probs dont do it
[5:08:59] Lionkingler1: 30 mins max with a proper guild
[5:09:00] esduewow: 45-1hr
[5:09:00] darkness4ghost: you can stack crates up to 12 in p2
[5:09:02] diarrerik: !video
[5:09:02] Nightbot: GIANT SOD PHASE 2 NEWS / DISCUSSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[5:09:05] bots_bots: IDEALLY 30 min WITH group finding
[5:09:10] bots_bots: ppl should be ready to go
[5:09:10] Frayeen: 30-40min
[5:09:13] letsgetgoingyo: 50 mins to get there and clear
[5:09:13] morgall1: 30 mins there and cleared
[5:09:18] Frayeen: 50max
[5:09:20] spike82q: get dmf if its up, ashenvale,  boon, consumes,  ....
[5:09:22] Lionkingler1: get summoned to bfd and then guild summon to the dungeon?
[5:09:31] Frayeen: even 1hr with randoms
[5:09:31] bots_bots: still worth
[5:09:39] joeythedisco: Are WC gold runs bannable at the moment or when phase 2 hits?
[5:09:44] bots_bots: unless it takes 50+ minutes its worth it
[5:09:48] Frayeen: if u do it with chat its 5hr+ LUL
[5:09:53] darkness4ghost: 50 min for bfd?
[5:10:03] darkness4ghost: are you guys insane? even in a pug it takes max 40min
[5:10:05] dj_clerik: @StaysafeTV first few runs of SM when it'll be hardest imo
[5:10:17] ThatGuyKB: it says bidding
[5:10:20] letsgetgoingyo: Big brain play is wait until others have done it, see how much XP they get, then decide 5Head
[5:10:20] Lionkingler1: boosting is legal?
[5:10:21] Mahca_: @darkness4ghost thats factoring in running there and running back to grinding spot
[5:10:22] thebedshow: btw either Feralas has no chest spawns or wowhead doesn't even have the objects for them. @StaysafeTV
[5:10:27] sargent_baddy: exp runs should be fine
[5:10:29] bots_bots: @darkness4ghost from the time u stop questing to the time u finsih could easily be 50 minutes tho
[5:10:35] chasegapo: what rule is it breaking
[5:10:39] garbobean: no more blackstone ring sales? :(
[5:10:42] Lionkingler1: its about auctioning off items for gold
[5:10:44] bots_bots: err not questing grinding but u know whhat i mean
[5:10:51] YazzLivee: yeh was checking myself also, could not find any chests/loot for feralas.
[5:10:51] sanspeur: damn no HoJ selling
[5:10:52] Ryafl1: i cant remember seeing any chests spawn there
[5:10:56] xecksi: selling items is against the rules but charging for boosts and not loot is fine right?
[5:11:00] TesservcT: they they despawned all the high level chests cause bots were looting them in EPL
[5:11:00] darkness4ghost: They already stated they are doing "Something" with the raid, which means there is information we dont have currently, possibly extra xp?
[5:11:01] seymourmoney: I don't think buying items off someone who won the roll will be bannable
[5:11:08] spike82q: its prob locked  due to bots  fly hacking
[5:11:10] mimmzzyyy: they took them out
[5:11:13] Ryafl1: wait i think they spawn near the entrance of DM
[5:11:15] Ryafl1: with all the ogres
[5:11:16] ThatGuyKB: It says bidding on item drops vs others i dont think inviting someone for loot drop with no bid vs other players
[5:11:22] wagyu_88: How do u know the crates will give 200 xp? didnt they get buff in P2? @StaysafeTV
[5:11:29] bots_bots: XD
[5:11:34] YazzLivee: KEKW
[5:11:34] batmern_: KEKW
[5:11:34] Mattysaiyan: NO WAY
[5:11:34] kaiju_kin: hahahah
[5:11:35] bots_bots: POOGERS
[5:11:36] SuperLost89: @darkness4ghost your about 4 days late
[5:11:43] OptimusBanana420: Peggers
[5:11:44] NutterCircus: Palworld here we come!
[5:11:45] TesservcT: can you even slowbro
[5:11:46] letsgetgoingyo: Wait until others do BFD, see how much XP they get
[5:11:46] indolent_sloth: actually my fav pokemon
[5:11:50] darkness4ghost: but you guys are stating "run time to the raid "
[5:11:50] Frayeen: PRChase
[5:12:01] Mattysaiyan: Is that a new Pal?
[5:12:07] darkness4ghost: You are theory crafting XP boosting without having full information
[5:12:11] 11111andrew11111: my guild always raids on Friday anyways so easy
[5:12:12] tylerificus: guess we will have to DISCOVER it on launch
[5:12:14] synix55: not sure why you wouldn't do bfd.. probably good xp?
[5:12:15] darkness4ghost: What's the point?
[5:12:30] Mahca_: looking at a chest location guide theres actually none in feralas? never knew that
[5:12:31] mattbarz989: druid raid tonight?
[5:12:43] bots_bots: @darkness4ghost We are already like 99% certain it gives XP, the thing we arent certain about is the exact amount
[5:12:45] SuperLost89: @darkness4ghost there is no point to any of this, just sit back and enjoy the stream
[5:12:56] Leffeegw: Lunar festival now

[5:15:24] NooleanB: Do quests reward extra gold if you're capped on XP?

[5:16:14] spri1nter: what do u need the boxes for?
[5:16:18] Mattysaiyan: Respectfully you are Horde scum now
[5:16:20] bots_bots: swiftthistle
[5:16:35] thebedshow: yeah I think 20x swiftthistle is the worst
[5:16:39] thebedshow: for cost wise
[5:16:43] Ryafl1: elixir of firepower is pretty bad too
[5:16:46] wagyu_88: I really think they are worth nothing past revered until P2 boxes
[5:16:49] coolcrazyguy72: do you hate me?
[5:17:05] numblezzz: @coolcrazyguy72 Madge
[5:17:05] pretty_cool_guy: Susge
[5:17:05] thebedshow: They didn't even logically make the amounts. Some person who knows nothing about classic jsut randomly decided amounts
[5:17:06] TesservcT: @leffeegw you sure it started
[5:17:08] TesservcT: ?
[5:17:17] NooleanB: @numblezzz thanks, that's neat
[5:17:17] bots_bots: shakenbaken only man staysafe hate

[5:17:40] Titus7: @StaysafeTV how much gold is your quest log worth?
[5:17:41] mike5140: you think these boxes will give rep towards revered?
[5:17:53] DankWizard420: griefing chests DansGame
[5:17:56] deathnntaxes: so NO boomkin BFD tonight? i was saving my lockout to run with you if you were
[5:18:15] spike82q: kind of want to go melee hunter, since  I was lucky enough to get  Hydra,
[5:18:23] Slizzzard: 20 maybe
[5:18:24] thebedshow: lol how did you save leaders of the fang until now? thats wild
[5:18:28] Titus7: I was just wondering how much gold you're giving up to level quickly
[5:18:44] wagyu_88: No. Past revered is P2 boxes
[5:18:49] Greedygoose: @Titus7 maybe 30
[5:18:51] coolcrazyguy72: the Karazan crypt raid should be cool
[5:18:57] numblezzz: gold gain will highly accelerate at 40 also theres not too much to buy
[5:19:44] thebedshow: I think they are gonna not give rep past honored like how the level 1-10 boxes only go to friendly but that is pure guessing
[5:20:18] Mattysaiyan: Better to have prepped and it be for nothing than be behind
[5:20:23] TesservcT: Speculators speculating on speculations
[5:20:24] dodgydad33: DICKS
[5:20:28] bald_n_gorgeous: back after 4 hours - is chat still being retarded?
[5:20:29] BadGerbilLion: Do you still do Ashenvale event for rep or is that not needed?
[5:20:31] thebedshow: im hoping the STV event is big xp too so it's worth doing all the time while leveling
[5:21:11] seymourmoney: what's your played time on this character
[5:21:35] spike82q: 11 here

In Season of Discovery, these items have been prevented from being restorable.     During maintenance on February 6, we will purge any that are already in players’ mailboxes.  We suggest that any players who have any Marks in your mailbox, retrieve them and use them before the end of Phase 1, or they will be lost. aaaa ur right on the 6th
