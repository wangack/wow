[1:39:35] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee Isn't the Spore shield as good or better than the skull flame ?
[1:39:59] Daledo907: @Kize15 Better imo cause it is a guarntee application upon block.
[1:40:01] The_Boctor: the drain life and the flame proc both scale with spell power
[1:40:18] CritcobainTV: Sporeggar shield is better for damage, but i think since skull flame heal scales with SP, its better for survivability

[2:38:56] Razzcobar: ye the 68-70 ones are the only ones that give rep past honored i think
[2:38:59] CritcobainTV: i was just watching a video that said how many dungeno runs it takes to get to revered, not honored, but he may have just been wrong
[2:39:07] CritcobainTV: Dungeon*
[2:39:37] Daledo907: Gotta grind to honored then go back and do quests. Fastest rep grind.
[2:39:43] Kingslik: what server you on?
[2:39:45] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Mojomash is a prot warrior in the guild right now, i think he plans to tank
[2:39:50] Quakezilla69: prot and bear
[2:39:53] Quakezilla69: all you need
[2:40:06] neverbornlucky: me
[2:40:24] ZaberAstaris: double prot
[2:40:31] Folkja: quakezilla69 are you sure about that? Kael'thas looks like a warrior main tank fight for me
[2:40:36] neverbornlucky: bear, warrior, and paladin tbc tanks
[2:40:39] BlueBeast33: warrior is still bis early game for bosses
[2:40:42] mceslex: warriors are easily the best tanks still

[2:41:06] cruzeal: for now
[2:41:07] jrpeh: early game
[2:41:09] CritcobainTV: Warriors are probably the best tank early on because they do better without gear
[2:41:11] alex12645: tbc had good shaman healers
[2:41:18] ZaberAstaris: could do double prot pally, or do prot war an prot pally
[2:41:30] Lemonsqze: LUL
[2:41:33] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:
[2:41:37] CritcobainTV: mages just think they're hot shit, like the warriors LUL
[2:41:38] Slajah: wars are best for the sustain, pallies for aoe aggro in TBC as far as I remember
[2:41:46] Kize_Gaming: Mage should give you int...
[2:41:49] neverbornlucky: painfully leveling a warrior
[2:41:51] ZaberAstaris: ^
[2:41:53] CritcobainTV: Warriors are the worst
[2:41:54] alex12645: tbc mages are just as bad
[2:42:08] CritcobainTV: warrior, mage hunter and rogue lol
[2:42:23] CritcobainTV: there is LUL
[2:42:23] D3m0nHunt3r666: Hunters are fine :p
[2:42:36] ZaberAstaris: you need the bear alive for quest
[2:42:39] CritcobainTV: Focus the guy because the bear is for the quest
[2:42:41] CritcobainTV: u cant kill him
[2:42:44] Snowfrogg: tbc bm hunters and locks is all you need as dps leave the rest:)
[2:42:53] CritcobainTV: not if you focus him first i think
[2:43:06] dutchie76: hey rob whats good
[2:43:10] alex12645: tbc bm hunter were op
[2:43:10] nihilistic_bat: you kill the bear second

[2:43:16] mceslex: aoe them both and let them decide LUL
[2:43:18] deebeeb: Guy first
[2:43:20] Daledo907: Prot pally, Feral druid who can do good dps and tank where needed. You can do alot of the content without a dedicated warrior tank. Fury warrior with tactical mastery and full defense gear can handle most ot duties and give good dps on fights where not needed.
[2:43:21] ZaberAstaris: after the lord dies the bear won't attack you anymore, and you can get your quest done
[2:43:21] deebeeb: He does more dmg
[2:43:23] CritcobainTV: oh my god hes getting melted lol
[2:43:34] dutchie76: lol
[2:43:41] neverbornlucky: my warrior is also blacksmith in tbc

[2:44:05] nihilistic_bat: we always just did that second, i dont think it mattered lol
[2:44:07] dutchie76: yea he does
[2:44:16] deebeeb: Saber wrong . Bear stops at 20%. Even when the guy is already dead
[2:44:16] CritcobainTV: LUL
[2:44:17] alex12645: thats normale
[2:44:27] dutchie76: triple !

[2:56:58] mceslex: @geobear79 if you're a tank your always in short supply, hunters on the other hand LUL
[2:57:03] Tyrolore: @Towelliee I felt pretty good when I managed to open the locked gate outside Shadow Labs (dungeon to the south in Auchindoun circle) with Eagle Eye talent. By using that you are able to see the switch on the other side.
[2:57:06] Daledo907: You will be fine just dance between seal of wisdom and light
[2:57:06] AlfredGG: MoP was good, but I heard the raiding wasn't that great
[2:57:06] LSBreed: don't they heal?

[3:00:02] mohmdoa: You attract them with th aggrro
[3:00:35] LorienV: Prot pallys are going to run spell power right?
[3:01:21] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Well you know how classic works. If it's not 100%, it's about 25%.
[3:01:26] Daledo907: Yes. Your threat generation is all based on holy damage
[3:02:07] mceslex: at what expansion is classic going to stop?
[3:02:16] scherri5: there l ike 50 people on the servers

[3:06:14] LSBreed: naxx was kinda ass. lk was okay, ToGC was a joke.
[3:06:18] Lemonsqze: Agreed

[3:07:01] Saephon: considering it was the first raid, part of the main expansion that they'd worked on prior to launch..... extra insulting
[3:07:07] LSBreed: ulduar was peak raiding..
[3:07:35] Slajah: wasnt it the people who were begging for Naxx again back then ?
[3:07:37] DeleldurTV: @Towelliee  if you take the difficulty aside what are your feelings towards ICC from a lore perspective?

[3:12:17] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Eh. Ulduar's model was neat but the potential for trolling, intentional or not, was too high. But yeah WoW needs a raid difficulty prune.
[3:12:43] Heekss: wod
[3:12:44] RogueBear: SoO
[3:12:58] LSBreed: those things aren't mutually exclusive. they could still do it across all levels. the hardest part would be balancing out the gear.

[3:23:57] Angel_Tea27: I like that you can choose to stay in classic or move on to Tbc
[3:23:59] Daledo907: Quit using seal of righteousness and use wisdom then after you judge it use light and tab to a new target and judge again. The start rotation over. You should be able to do 4 at a time that way and use consecrate the whole time
[3:24:00] Wavekingg: @Towelliee For me Shadowlands doesnt feel rewarding enough for the time I spend playing it...
[3:24:07] Heekss: i just think blizz has moved too far away from OG wow, which is why ppl dont like SL
[3:24:08] ShadoodHD: how goes the madness? lol
[3:24:17] SimonCB777: think 9.1 is may
[3:24:26] mceslex: Shadowlands downtime was planned a year ago to hype up tbc

[3:25:17] RarePoPo: LUL
[3:25:19] scenario17: blasphemy
[3:25:21] wickywow: Just tell him PTR usually takes 2.5 months, so "earliest" is june
[3:25:23] wickywow: LOL
[3:25:23] bromanda_theblur: Yo @towelliee did you ever play any fable?
[3:25:24] SimonCB777: saw a guy on youtube say may :P
[3:25:27] Lemonsqze: LUL
[3:25:29] Phoxzy: Honestly Covid had much more effect on development time than Blizzard even wants to admit, and just like every other part of industry in general it has an a lasting negative effect.
[3:25:54] TheEnstraynomic: if 9.1 comes out in may 2022, towelliee would have paid off the new mustang mach-e already LUL
[3:26:02] XshadowturkeyX: i mean bfa launched in early aug then 8.1 was early dec
[3:26:09] XshadowturkeyX: raid in jan
[3:26:12] plumpus81: Fuck COVID in all
[3:26:23] wickywow: Its just so sad, when legion patch cycle was lined up so perfectly

[3:28:16] alex12645: i think it going to be a long time tell we get the patch
[3:28:34] hoosgames: so SL isn't worth coming back for? seems like the hype dried up super quick with streamers
[3:29:27] Quakezilla69: how much friendly do you think M+ was in legion compared to now?
[3:30:03] TheEnstraynomic: 15k for AWC is a joke when a recent AOE2 tournament had 65k viewers at one point NotLikeThis
[3:30:14] Everbliss: @hoosgames I think it worth it to level a character to max level once and see some of the covenant stuff. it's worth about 30-days of game time imo

[3:30:36] Athaeln: After all the buildup from BFA if Shadowlands ends in 9.2 it would be a major dissapointment
[3:30:41] Mr_fantastic123: i dont mind them strecthing shadowlands out as long as they bring out good content
[3:30:48] Angel_Tea27: we had the digital one to make up for last years. We might still have one later as usual?

[3:32:52] XshadowturkeyX: shadiwkands had potential to be really good

[3:42:15] Seresin: I wonder if the anima for cosmetics was supposed to fill that role of "after progression" daily play, but the cost of all the items and grind of the currency is too huge.

[5:03:39] Rudric_Ice: avengers shield should cost that much of mana in retail too
[5:04:02] Sh4nti: You got it
[5:04:32] xViewersunitedx: in prepatch druid threat gets nerfed and without 70 gear we.wont have enough stats to make up with attack power markiE
[5:04:43] Sh4nti: Doubt that would work on heroic but would be interesting to see LUL
[5:04:46] FrostWolfOSRS: i wish i was on beta right now
[5:05:00] Daledo907: Once you get the SP you can downrank Consecrate and still hold threat just fine. Also once you have Seal of vengance  and tab stacks up on all the mobs nobody is pullin off of you.

[5:06:40] FrostWolfOSRS: cant warlock do fire shield aswell?
[5:06:44] Sh4nti: I think their HoTs don't work with your mana talent though
[5:06:50] alex12645: druid and a good shaman that know what there doing
[5:06:52] elvia_: can we order gfuel in europe?
[5:06:56] Wardog442: Plus, you are able to Rez, what the druid lacks.
[5:07:01] Daledo907: The stronger the healer the more mana back from spiritual attunement and the larger you can pull
[5:07:03] FrostWolfOSRS: and then have a resto shaman for mana spring/mana tide
[5:07:07] gold9871: there imp can
[5:07:11] Shrenko: @elvia_ yes

[5:08:40] KiLLaVuLKeN: do hunters not have misdirection?
[5:08:42] RekzCrew: they dont get misdirect until 68 right?
[5:09:04] FrostWolfOSRS: i reckon a resto shaman and prot paladin would go well together
[5:09:17] zonfry: I remember my bear tank just doing a 3 hit frontal swipe, but that did the job, i also remember the odd death from hitting the cat form button when raid tanking, wondering weather to go pally tank in bc for the big aoe, or else going bear for the 1 spec to kitty, tank and heal

[5:54:08] BlueBeast33: Yeah I do think pre-patch and actual release will do a lot better
[5:54:11] Merlin840: we had a rogue tanking Karazhan towards the end of the xpac for shits and giggles
[5:54:14] MrGattz: FailFish he just wanted the jebait the viewers for an entire week while knowing it wasnt actually coming out, then it comes out so the pre hype is gone and he doesnt care. its not that hard to figure him out.
[5:54:15] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[5:54:48] PsychoWarren: the only thing that changed was that the elite quest are not elite quest anymore in tbc lol
[5:54:53] GOD_NAT: I think WotLK has a bigger pull than TBC
[5:55:03] bimyouX: man dungeons without damage meter is so boring
[5:55:04] shadowmoonsmile: yeah its very noticable the hype isnt like classic

[5:56:51] protyn: 9.1 and wrath classic come out at once? :D
[5:56:51] TheMcNutt: Are you casting two ranks of consecrate?
[5:56:52] CasualSCN: towLul
[5:56:57] danimoto10: I am asking myself what will they do  after WOTLK
[5:57:00] Kaihrn: you would have to jump Cata classic for that to happen haha
[5:57:01] katzachiel: loved the spelle designs more too
[5:57:06] Carmisin: I still got Frostmourne on my wall.
[5:57:12] Mortal_Wombat_: think wotlk will be a thing and thats it then
[5:57:13] alex12645: some warlocks hated mop
[5:57:36] Gizimoo86: yeah subs record at BC release probably
[5:57:42] Breakers__: @Mortal_Wombat_ That would be the perfect ending point
[5:57:43] feherlofia123: if TBC was released after Wrath , numbers would probably be the same. personnally i didnt like wrath
[5:57:52] mythradrill: bring back AP was the OG stat to have
[5:57:58] MrGattz: well because of covid its not gonna be 10.0 unfortunately
[5:58:10] mythradrill: poor plates in wrath
[5:58:10] XarkoLP: i m waiting for Warlords classic. Chilling all day in the garrision was the best time Kappa
[5:58:14] twistedstick1: No changes
[5:58:20] mcdoublemcgee: He knowssssa
[5:58:30] MrGattz: im honestly not even sure they are gonna do what they wanted to do for 10.0
[5:58:32] PsychoWarren: lmfao @XarkoLP
[5:58:46] Poriand: I imagine we see player housing next expansion
[5:59:14] MrGattz: we wont.
[5:59:17] Gizimoo86: no way
[5:59:23] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: would be cool tho
[5:59:23] normysan: I don't think we will ever get that
[5:59:26] Screamxan: too much work
[5:59:30] geokouts: We had Garrisons :P
[5:59:32] abxos: next expansion. minecraft IN wow
[5:59:32] Kromede: i need 4 mississipis to get aggro
[5:59:39] lovecult85: housing is for ESO only ;D
[5:59:41] Merlin840: you don't think they'll start throwing stuff into WoW at the end of its life cycle for their next MMO to test?
[5:59:42] mythradrill: they cant code a si,ple wq and u want them to give u housing?
[5:59:42] protyn: imagine VR WoW
[5:59:43] Drogdorf: Garrisons PogChamp
[5:59:49] MrGattz: there are ways to make it work well in wow, similar to ffxiv. but it wont happen.
[5:59:55] FolkWardz: Already have player housing, its called the character screen
[5:59:58] katzachiel: kinda weird pala tank with mana
[6:00:02] toffelito: lvl 65 monkaS
[6:00:03] TheUnknowing: WoW isn't built for player housing and tbh its too much work that blizz would rather put else where
[6:00:20] mythradrill: its not about to much work. they cant do it
[6:00:28] twistedstick1: We had player housing. It was called garrisons and they where great but need an update now. HahaBall
[6:00:32] toffelito: Pog
[6:00:39] TheUnknowing: I just don't see WoW being that kind of MMO tbh
[6:00:43] Archjin: Cheer100 @Towelliee I hope WoW 2 would be the Retail Azeroth but made into a large leveling/questing/exploring world like wow was back in Vanilla with all the new races and updated graphics, keep the grind of vanilla and all the atunements but add arena and bgs, and make 30man normal raids and hardcore mythic raids, in my opinion that would be really good, what you think?
[6:00:46] alex12645: i know tbc had the most  fix and broken stuff in it
[6:00:48] hokagie: do you think that gbid and gdkp raids will be a thing early on tbc?
[6:00:52] TheMcNutt: Are you casting two ranks of concentrate?
[6:00:52] PvtHudson093: ret weapon
[6:00:57] Wedgeh: My warrior just got moist looking at that
[6:00:58] MrGattz: there is no wow 2
[6:01:00] FolkWardz: That a dope wep
[6:01:03] MrGattz: dont get your hopes up
[6:01:19] geokouts: It is on beta so dont expect it so soon when it is out :P
[6:01:21] MrGattz: your asking for classic ++
[6:01:25] Kromede: MrGattz idk, 50-50 MiniK
[6:01:27] Archjin: @MrGattz
[6:01:34] Merlin840: and... on your phone.
[6:01:44] Archjin: @MrGattz yup i am, but with modern grpahics and with Mythic raids thats it
[6:01:49] DoubleNova: Classic 3 when Kappa
[6:02:02] Kaihrn: Vanilla Heroic would be coolio
[6:02:03] vakaarian: Wildstar is what he just described and look how that turned out
[6:02:04] hokagie: do you think that gbid and gdkp raids will be a thing early on tbc?
[6:02:04] MrGattz: @Archjin yeah. im not saying its a bad idea, i would love it. it just wont ever happen.
[6:02:25] protyn: Here is the right.defense macro if u want it: #showtooltip Righteous Defense /cast [help] Righteous Defense; [target=targettarget] Righteous Defense
[6:02:25] Archjin: @MrGattz unfortunetly i agree completely
[6:02:27] twistedstick1: They need to make our MOP farms usable for current content.
[6:02:34] Rayman_1990: heroic brd 30 hours run
[6:02:55] Screamxan: there is no perfect mmo, if there was then the community would trash it.

[6:06:52] twistedstick1: DrinkPurple
[6:06:53] Gurtington_: with Amazon prime, do I get a free sub every month? or did I just use up my free sub?

[6:07:42] theFysh: why does consecrate sometimes look like it's cast twice in a row?
[6:07:56] kyouch91: oh but not for the same streamer i think
[6:07:59] vyjinx: no it ran out
[6:08:22] TheUnknowing: Ashes is listening to the vocal minority just like wildstar did

[6:08:41] Osskssa: you lol
[6:08:45] vonblue: wildstar is an example of a developer not keeping up with the times
[6:08:48] kronnnotv: 2 weeks should be enough to hit max lvl
[6:08:51] Overbuilt_Gaming: idk what game you're talking about but I already quit it!

[6:08:52] ham__george: Visually AoC is very boring

[6:09:38] Steinbus: @theFysh highest rank concecration for initial damage, lower rank for follow up
[6:09:43] Layercake: They need to make huge concessions ...if they only appeal to '' old school mmo hardcore nerds'' i smell a Wildstar
[6:09:48] kilaran: I would say max 20 days is something that people would be able do but 45 is insane

[6:09:52] Gizimoo86: whats the rush if going to play mmorpg years?
[6:09:54] Mortal_Wombat_: imagine getting to max level and then they nerf your class and you have to reroll monkaS
[6:09:59] MrGattz: anymore more than 7 days of ingame play time is to much for hitting a max level
[6:09:59] dym_jt: Just do 16 hour days/sessions and do it in 22-23 days :P
[6:10:06] Gurtington_: ONLY WAY I'd do that 8 hours a day for 45 days is if the combat was AMAZING, the story telling was fantastic, the zones are BEAUTIFUL and the community is helpful and fun
[6:10:08] TheUnknowing: Kreygasm

[6:10:58] MrGattz: pantheon is looking damn good
[6:11:02] Screamxan: the only mmo im even slightly hopeful for is the riot one that probably wont be out within 5 years :(
[6:11:05] Avinar: when I see ashes, I get a feel it tries to be too broad with not enough depth but also maybe focuses RPers over PVE people. pantheon looks fun
[6:11:17] MrGattz: @Collected1 wait have you see the recent live streams though?
[6:11:26] Enigmio: i dont know, but one part of me wants a new MMO from blizzard
[6:11:35] Avinar: the art and outfits i'm mixed on with ashes
[6:11:43] Collected1: MrGattz : i've seen the play demo they showed which was for investment... looked great. But content to keep people subbed? That's where they'll fall over.
[6:11:43] Gurtington_: would kill for a new mmo that I could spend as many hours as I do in wow
[6:11:46] szble: that's what i've been thinking they've been pumping art out and the combat was trash

[6:12:12] theFysh: reminds me of archeage. you had a big advantage in building with real money invested
[6:12:21] Avinar: I hope the combat feels good by next year but even at the start the combat looked jank
[6:12:51] szble: archeage alpha was so good
[6:12:52] Collected1: to launch a successful sub based MMO in 2021 you need content, content, content. And Pantheon doesn't stand a chance of that for me. They don't have the resources to go and create thousands of mobs, quests and a huge world.
[6:13:02] Eikus11: Im glad they are toneing down that ability annimations in AOC they are over the top atm
[6:13:08] Mortal_Wombat_: i want my tab target. im to old for this action combat shit
[6:13:10] Breakers__: I heard someone say "The 'cartoonish' graphics WoW is based on is why it's still relevant 14 years later." I have not stopped thinking about that comment...
[6:13:37] PvtHudson093: yeet
[6:13:50] Avinar: idk I thought the animations in AOC looked mediocre. like they snap back quickly after finishing their animations. looked like a mediocre ESO version
[6:14:02] Kromede: beautiful sockets BibleThump
[6:14:05] Kaihrn: 2 bars to go
[6:14:13] MrGattz: @Collected1 Cohh did a live stream with the devs not that long ago and it for sure depends on what you consider content but its basically and old style rpg with mmo elements. like lore everywhere and everything is clickable with descriptions and shit. the combat looked smooth and well thought out. its definitely not your average themepark mmo and it will turn a lot of people away for it but what its doing atm is really cool.
[6:14:18] Avinar: I love action combat and I really want a good action combat game. I was really loving new world but it was really rough
[6:14:18] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:14:24] szble: action combat is meh especially when it comes to raiding
[6:14:25] idenkaz_: thex should go the NMS route and go dark for a couple of months and work on the game instead of showing us all the store shit everyday.
[6:14:31] alex12645: spell power
[6:14:39] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: You could gem for defense stats and stick with the INT piece.
[6:14:44] Ponickz: Redux09 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! good morning
[6:14:52] EmDuBB13: im surprised it coming!! so excited :)
[6:14:53] DenTza: AngelThump the son
[6:15:28] Avinar: healing is the biggest mixed bag for me with action combat though then also you don't really get a MMO feel sometimes since you can't have too many people fighting one boss unless they are just massive, it starts getting jank with tons on a medium size boss
[6:15:28] PvtHudson093: i hated this boss back in the day
[6:15:40] Layercake: Every time i listen to that AOC Steven dude talk, he just sound like a used card salesmen , telling what you want to ear. He very well knows they will never pull what they are promising
[6:15:42] Avinar: body blocking and such

[6:16:08] MrGattz: if it resets LUL
[6:16:09] Layercake: *car
[6:16:15] silodin: Long live the king!
[6:16:27] Collected1: MrGattz : Oh for sure, what Cohh showed looked very promising. No doubt about that. Like I said above I just fear they won't have the resources to create a world big enough to keep people subbed past Month 1 or 2.
[6:16:32] Osskssa: tbc dungeons tough?
[6:16:37] Kromede: 3 sockets POGGERS
[6:16:38] Avinar: idk I want ashes to be good though because I really want a good PVE focused MMO , don't need any more PVE MMO's failing lol
[6:16:56] theFysh: @Kromede and 4 agil color bonus Pog
[6:17:31] Brobertos: suss
[6:17:48] szble: at least they've been listening to feedback i guess. like with the fireball animation they changed
[6:17:50] BlueBeast33: The thing though is that if they can't deliver on a lot of what they're promising then the game probably won't do well.
[6:18:02] idenkaz_: i mean he fully funded it from the start, 30M i think.
[6:18:11] Kromede: did u see mmobyte's video on kickstarter? they tried to pay him for a good review
[6:18:26] Gizimoo86: competition is crazy just like twitch streaming now
[6:18:29] DoubleNova: mmos are one hell of a development process
[6:18:30] Baldee: no mans sky all over again
[6:18:34] DoubleNova: almost not worth it
[6:18:37] MrGattz: @Collected1 i mean i know for a fact that they have a couple of 7 figure investors. if they can put the money to deving more dungeons and maybe raids and just more stuff. we'll see eventually.
[6:18:39] Avinar: star citizen the MMO
[6:18:53] Exodeo_: Did you ever try Eso?
[6:18:56] Kaihrn: oh yeh where they at with star citizen lol
[6:18:59] MrGattz: dont even mention star scam every citizen
[6:19:05] szble: too many mmos try to reinvent the wheel when they dont need to
[6:19:06] silodin: cancelot underdevelopped KEKW
[6:19:08] Mortal_Wombat_: cu not before 2022
[6:19:08] Gizimoo86: you need crazy good game to sell it or keep it alive
[6:19:08] idenkaz_: i still have faith in SC. its just a massive project that will pay off.
[6:19:15] MrGattz: its not going to happen and all yall got scammed big time
[6:19:17] Shrenko: how was the apple Gfuel @Towelliee ?!
[6:19:26] EmDuBB13: lol idk
[6:19:36] DoubleNova: no 2 who are you?
[6:19:38] danimoto10: lol
[6:19:39] Lockdown_247: Camelot hot garbage
[6:19:40] Kromede: money back lol
[6:19:42] Avinar: I just mean AOC's situation reminds me of star citizen lol
[6:19:42] Lupine_Fury: ah, the snipers
[6:19:43] stratiss: its in beta right now
[6:19:45] EmDuBB13: naw man im sure they "working on it"
[6:19:45] Osskssa: no lol
[6:19:49] EmDuBB13: dont sweat it
[6:20:04] zikez: oh 62!  sporogar shield inc? xD
[6:20:08] Breakers__: Speaking of cancelled games...is Dead Island 2 ever going to come out?!
[6:20:16] silodin: star citizen when? KEKW
[6:20:32] Kaihrn: Star Citizen biggest pyramid sceme of all time lol
[6:20:35] DoubleNova: Can there be a class action lawsuit?
[6:20:45] Lockdown_247: Comelot having a event this weekend for kick starters
[6:20:52] szble: that node system is so complex
[6:20:54] Gizimoo86: star citizen ok but holy shit going to take forerver to complete it
[6:20:55] Avinar: and that's only if they want to do features, not even including a polished combat
[6:21:09] MrGattz: @Kaihrn im not sure if it falls under the definition of pyramid sceme.. but it is a scam
[6:21:10] Collected1: @Collected1 Yeah we'll see. I hope I'm wrong and they make a success of it.
[6:21:11] Osskssa: no its gobe
[6:21:28] Ysida: i would rather play ff14
[6:21:36] MrGattz: @Collected1 me to! it would be nice to have some fresh blood in the mmo area :P
[6:21:36] VonGrimz: yeah pretty sure kickstarter money is spent, hope you would getit back thoufgh
[6:21:54] Avinar: next up, pantheon owned by Nexon LUL
[6:22:02] Coox69: @Towelliee don't forget to give him the staff :D
[6:22:16] Kaihrn: lmao
[6:22:17] szble: lol
[6:22:19] silodin: older ash shit*
[6:22:27] Kromede: u think u do, but actually not KEKW
[6:22:32] Avinar: GrandpaTowel streams PogChamp
[6:22:41] szble: the player corruption system is cool too
[6:22:44] Lockdown_247: So if a mmo is finally good enough to kill wow, you moving over or staying with wow
[6:22:46] alex12645: LUL
[6:22:49] Kromede: haha
[6:22:54] MrGattz: cohhOld
[6:23:03] Eikus11: cant wait for Chronicles of Elyria...cant be too much longer I swear
[6:23:04] Archjin: @Towelliee were you always horde? and if racials were not a factor which faction would you pick?
[6:23:06] Kromede: slootBoomer
[6:23:13] nhn66: can we see ur gear if possible? Big fan!!!
[6:23:13] Avinar: that's gonna be a lot of senior naps
[6:24:10] Avinar: europeans should be getting on
[6:24:14] katkis88: @Towelliee remember, the shield costs 15 glowcaps too :)
[6:24:27] PvtHudson093: love the cenerion hippogriff from rep hand ins
[6:24:53] Kaihrn: be interesting to see the difference between the two shields
[6:24:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:25:13] protyn: You can loot glowcaps from glowing mushrooms on the ground, similar to herbalism
[6:25:20] katkis88: 10 or 15, but yeah, doesnt cost money, glowcaps instead
[6:25:34] alex12645: LUL
[6:25:54] Avinar: "The game isn't about the end game but the journey and friends we made along the way" LUL

[6:26:01] moxing_hei: wildstar all overr again
[6:26:11] Soproatlol: did it tho?
[6:26:11] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[6:26:12] Varchord: shame tho, cause dungs and combat in wildstar was nice
[6:26:12] MrGattz: the majority of players are casual. if you dont appeal to the casuals, you will not have a successful game
[6:26:18] MrGattz: end of story
[6:26:19] LAXNESS: nobody wants to level for 45days, casuals will probably take 3 times as long seqKEK
[6:26:23] Ramzilla92: i miss Wildstar..
[6:26:23] EmDuBB13: yeah play some poe and tell me that enough days Kapp
[6:26:26] Kromede: oh i had 2 level 50 in wildstar, got them for free KEKW
[6:26:28] EmDuBB13: any game needs more
[6:26:43] Avinar: dungeons were too hard for 80% of the people. I couldn't get a party to clear , too many bad players lol
[6:26:50] Quimby54: @MrGattz SL is a good example. The exodus of the casuals
[6:26:52] Karmegeddon: nobody wants long grindy levelling experiances. They want decent storylines to play through
[6:26:56] PapaBjorn89: but the opposite is also bad like look a new runescape
[6:27:01] Manabucho: they need to reinvent it
[6:27:03] PapaBjorn89: shit is terrible
[6:27:22] chrslp: Anyone remember the Age of Conan flop? LUL
[6:27:24] Avinar: the other main issue is people think all the content and stuff to do is at the end of the game. if you give people stuff to do as they level, it could be ok in ways
[6:27:30] MrGattz: @Quimby54 well.. yes but also everyone else that isnt a mythic raider that isnt finished the raid. sl has several other issues that are more than just not being casual friendly
[6:27:35] vonblue: ppl need to learn the lessons of wildstar
[6:27:42] MagicHoof: all these new mmos are so boring, uninspired cheap knockoffs
[6:27:57] Broviathan_of_the_Brocean: *Just* exalted, lol
[6:28:24] Kaihrn: test both out
[6:28:26] BlueBeast33: You should try the Auchindoun dungeons
[6:28:29] Avinar: too many games make leveling a chore to only expose us to the world rather than making it have a meaning with what you are doing and having longevity
[6:29:20] BlueBeast33: I meant next stream
[6:29:26] Mortianto: Mortianto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 86 months!

[6:34:15] silodin: there is this thing called innerta
[6:34:19] silodin: innertia*
[6:34:21] danimoto10: crazy af
[6:34:22] cabalish: i think they have to get rid of some containers to move it
[6:34:23] Kaihrn: yeh i think so then try n tug it a bit
[6:34:24] chrslp: Just build a canal around it. Duh Kappa
[6:34:31] arlog111: why they even make just 1 path for ships to pass. why not make multiple to avoid this?
[6:34:34] Brobertos: They tried to entice it witch a really sexy female ship
[6:34:36] Varinius: Suez-Suez Canal PogChamp
[6:34:43] LoseAlotLuke: just make a new canal next to it 4Head
[6:34:50] Kromede: vingardium leviosa it Kappa

[6:35:36] Kromede: the captain drew a penis on the sea KEKWlaugh
[6:35:37] MrGattz: heres what you do. you attach a jet engine to the side of the ship and launch it back into sea. problem solved
[6:35:39] Kaihrn: just goes to show if some crazy group manged to destroy a part of that canal voila big mess
[6:35:45] theooogamer: Its a bit discuting watching u play tbc beta when u left wow classic at phase 1 no?
[6:35:45] Tamex26: was it human error or just a crappy scenario?
[6:35:52] Varinius: both I think

[6:36:04] Varinius: there was crazy winds but they also said human error
[6:36:06] chrslp: Crashing a boat is a death sentence for a captains career. Even if not entirely your fault
[6:36:06] LoseAlotLuke: it was mainly horrible winds from the storm
[6:36:15] MrGattz: rockets solve all problems
[6:36:22] Jokervenom1978: It got messed up in a sandstorm.
[6:36:22] beckett3a: how buggy are most quests Towelliee? i've been hearing the beta's buggy as hell

[6:38:32] cabalish: supergirl maybe
[6:38:32] qtla: @Towelliee There are boats that carry oil platforms
[6:38:33] silodin: There was a rumor that the ship is lodged in on purpose as to sky-rocket the price of oil after the recent dips.
[6:38:35] Aedarax: Area 52 gonna bring there space ships KEKW

[6:39:04] SavageCheez: Call Nick Fury. have him bring in the Hellicarrier. He can move it.
[6:39:04] Kaihrn: bet the Chinese will turn up and say hold my beer
[6:39:06] MrGattz: tug boats dont have the strength to move those ships
[6:39:08] deniz_alliance: Mostly just between asia and europe

[6:39:35] Madfrak: 1 cable and those 300 boats waiting there all need to help pull Kappa
[6:39:36] Kromede: captain was like upsi

[6:39:47] MrGattz: it would be quicker to build a new canal than try to unstuck the ship LUL

[6:39:53] Shrenko: its weird the canal isn't wider
[6:39:54] chrslp: I saw someone that invested heavily in Bunny rabbit futures in Europe. Turns out theres a ship behind the blockage that is FULL of the entire supply of multiple countries bunny rabbits
[6:40:04] azabanned: Hey chat is tbc pressing 1 button/ auto attacks and waiting for mana? Can it be more interesting and enjoyable than retial?
[6:40:04] chrslp: I know it sounds stupid but LUL
[6:40:04] silodin: not all ships can go around the cape of good hope. the sea down there is way too turbulent for panamax ships build specifically for the suez and panama canal.

[6:41:23] chrslp: Something similar happened before and all the shipping companies started dumping their cargo in Africa for dirt cheap and it made their economy soar temporarily
[6:41:39] LoseAlotLuke: step bro

[6:42:06] Wcvechten: @Shrenko I have unironically seen a drawing of this already
[6:42:07] GoKu1g: Imagine if those cargo ships are filled with Covid vaccines for the US FeelsBadMan
[6:42:08] Kromede: u can't make a U-turn in the canal, captain: hold my beer
[6:42:25] BulldozerBear: They got hit by high winds when  entering the canal
[6:42:29] chrslp: They aint shipping covid vaccines on boats LUL
[6:42:32] BulldozerBear: and a sand storm
[6:42:35] silodin: eurobeat still on full blast
[6:42:38] LoseAlotLuke: somali pirares sailing north right now ready for action
[6:42:49] frejdal: Better rename that boat to stepsis after this
[6:42:57] Shongoshi: is that the boat I heard about 3days ago ? or another one

[6:43:37] Avinar: he'd already be in italy before news caught wind of it
[6:43:37] Shrenko: its weird the canal isnt wider

[6:44:04] blazenalot: it's 4 football fields
[6:44:05] MrGattz: @grognardgames i would think even pirates have some brains lol
[6:44:06] imagwa: 224,000 tonnes 400 meters long, just nudge it round
[6:44:12] Kaihrn: ironic name though calling a boat that size  Evergreen  smh
[6:44:19] desmo7: it would be fixed instantly but i dont think anyone wants to spend the money to do it.. then who compensates them?
[6:44:19] Jame20009: Just throw off the side
[6:44:22] silodin: It's bad enough as it is but the us navy has offered to help so it is about to get a whole lot worse.
[6:44:24] tribellion: Is this OG soundtrack??
[6:44:26] MrGattz: it would cost more in fuel for the helicopter than to just leave the ship there
[6:44:28] HotFlakesTom: They probably could but the cost would be insane
[6:44:29] eakiller: than the ship will capsize
[6:44:35] tiry77: tiry77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[6:45:04] bruhSit_farmer: ship happens !!!
[6:45:18] Kaihrn: the Chinese will turn up with a crazy crane boat
[6:45:19] MetaChar: danger is the ship turning sideways, because the front of it is out of the water with a lot of sand inside the channel
[6:45:24] szble: they're saying today that the port authority chief said it wasnt strong winds
[6:45:41] deniz_alliance: Apperntly they don't have helicopters that can lift loaded containers as they to heavy
