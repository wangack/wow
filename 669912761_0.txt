[1:56:26] Kahlandra: its hard to do NA and EU when they are playing on live servers, plus since it is all remote, the lag between the two would be a lot, make it more difficult to play
[1:56:27] Vellkun: or is this a live server?
[1:56:29] OopsAllJerries: storml4Hi

[5:29:41] volpi_i: Valcore hiding on roof and they missed it. If he can lock him to Monkeynews close in on him this can be huge for them. 1 min later arcane explosion all over the roof. :) completely game sense ofc :)
[5:29:44] jakob_tv: Noggenfogger Face! <3
