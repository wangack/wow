[1:04:29] TheUnone: @ackisen due to NA less frequently proc'ing queues, NA rating limit is less so 2600 NA = 2750 EU, so if you're judgeing rating-wise, it's the opposite. Skill-wise, top NA players are super worth at world level, though EU has a lot of them and some of them have a very high level even amongst.
