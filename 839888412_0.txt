[0:04:15] Zettabyte: towHi
[0:04:26] MrGattz: iv come to the conclusion that layer 8 is NOT worth doing for the extra 40 soul ash.
[0:04:54] MrGattz: took us 90 mins to finish and it was the most stressed out iv been in a long time lol
[0:06:06] SlayerLightStorm: Oh shit, this starting soon screen looks SICK! towPog
[0:06:23] Sadisticmedic: @MrGattz Did you see Slasher's Tweet on the new TOS
[0:06:24] NetherRegion: towHAMUP
[0:06:43] MrGattz: @Sadisticmedic uhhh i dont think so? for what? twitch or blizzard?
[0:06:58] Kinghorn: what up
[0:07:29] Sadisticmedic: @MrGattz Twitch you can use SM*P, Inc*l or Virg*n in chat
[0:07:29] SlayerLightStorm: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:07:42] Sadisticmedic: Cannot use Sorry @MrGattz
[0:07:58] MrGattz: is this about the stuff they went over in the twitch town hall stuff? cause i watched all of that.
[0:08:29] MrGattz: it basically says you cant say shit that is *unwanted* by the streamer in a chat
[0:08:42] Sadisticmedic: @MrGattz Yeah This just came out about 30 mins ago it was added to the TOS.
[0:09:06] MrGattz: can you throw me a link
[0:09:25] Sadisticmedic: @MrGattz Yeap as always especially anything that reflex people's sexuality
[0:10:18] MrGattz: because the way i interpreted it was that its fine as long as the streamer doesnt care
[0:10:24] jkitchin75: begone kid
[0:10:28] LadyJasmin: hey! don't be rude. it's their first time
[0:10:31] SlayerLightStorm: towRekt towByah
[0:11:35] MrGattz: because like its fine if call that dude i timed out a virgin. its not breaking tos to do so
[0:11:51] Sadisticmedic: @MrGattz I sent you the Tweet from Slasher
[0:11:54] Apokolipz: monkaSoap
[0:12:00] MrGattz: yeah i got it ill read it
[0:12:28] Sadisticmedic: @MrGattz Call someone a Virgin is now against TOS
[0:12:32] MrGattz: hypothetically speaking
[0:12:34] jkitchin75: so whos in the lead for world first
[0:12:51] Sadisticmedic: @jkitchin75 Limit
[0:12:52] SlayerLightStorm: It ain't Echo.

[0:15:37] somedudehenry: how are holy pallys ?
[0:15:44] Its22Forever: still 3
[0:15:48] MrGattz: ah ok. i see. so. simp, incel or virgin *specifically* when used to negatively refer to another persons *"sexual practices"* is bannable when used *repeatedly* to harass. there are key words there.
[0:16:04] Its22Forever: about to be 4
[0:16:21] jkitchin75: well you only said it once so your good
[0:16:39] MrGattz: i can call @AaronxxGames a simp because hes a sub to towelliee. thats not breaking tos.

[0:18:06] simpdaddy23: A simp is my child
[0:18:21] MrGattz: @jkitchin75 a simp is basically someone that throws money and favors at someone all day long in hopes to get something in return for it. at least as far as my knowledge goes on that.
[0:18:37] Baladore: Apparently twitch TOS has now banned the use of Simp
[0:18:44] Kinghorn: sounds like you missed the twitch town hall towelliee
[0:18:54] MrGattz: its fine, nothing will change at least in this channel

[1:08:27] guapo_uktabi: One changes all 4 rune colors one does 3 one does 2 and one does 1, once you figure those out you just change the runes to unlock from 4 to 1

[2:20:06] enfant666terrible: unfair world
[2:20:12] Artivicii: @enfant666terrible lmao, if you found out what happened behind the scenes you would call everyone cheating
[2:20:14] Dkgungo: instead of spamming in trade for a boe farm they are doing it on a stream
[2:20:25] josh8555: ahhh
[2:20:45] enfant666terrible: i know... they say every guild does it... but i think it is a - c h e a t
[2:20:47] Artivicii: @enfant666terrible world first guilds have coders for mods, coaches, lots of $$$ put into it

[2:20:59] banned_play3r: you ally?
[2:21:16] JinzDan: I don't mind guilds buying boe's, but I was a bit disappointed that limit killed Council off stream

[2:21:26] KatiDragoness: I can't clear Upper Layer 8 and I crushed it every week, tried like 6 times today :( (Priest)

[2:23:41] nihilistic_bat: Blizzard watches all these mythic guilds if they exploited on purpose they would be banned instantly
[2:23:48] PoopdeckClaxton: @Towelliee, Max explained it: it was their last hour of streaming, and they expected it to be harder than it was. Streaming it would have definitely benefitted Echo.

[4:08:47] Thirtys3v3n: Lawyers, Realtors
[4:08:51] byrdeen45: it pays for your taxes and insurence in a account
[4:08:53] Khyber_GT: escrow is a reserve that pays your taxes and insurance
[4:08:55] Brathus11: @Towelliee escrow - Your money goes to an account that nobody can take it out of until the contract is fulfilled
[4:09:18] Brathus11: a middle party essentially holds it so nobody backs out
[4:09:30] Othala254: Yes, just don't buy a car or get a loan
[4:09:40] Othala254: Basically don't affect your credit until it's done
[4:09:50] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Or 3 iphones

[4:09:58] forthereals: don't buy a boat stuff like that
[4:10:00] Czyszn: which sneakers you into
[4:10:04] Thirtys3v3n: just make sure you have at least 20% the purchase value in your account.

[4:10:11] Dkgungo: buying a house and car damn that twitch deal must of been sweet
[4:10:28] Unvein: You could always look into getting a Line of Credit using the equity from the home, then youd have a direct line to use as you wish.
[4:10:40] Khyber_GT: lenders will pull credit before you close and if they see you bought a car. you don goofed
[4:10:47] Sadisticmedic: Escrow is for to play for Property taxes and Home Owners insurance
[4:11:12] Thirtys3v3n: @Unvein You have no equity in a home you just took out a mortgage on.
[4:11:28] ObliqueTV: ^
[4:11:38] Khyber_GT: you can. depends on how much you put down...
[4:11:40] MagiMetal: ^ Depends on the down payment
[4:11:49] Unvein: depends on how much he puts n.
[4:11:53] ObliqueTV: robbing sam to pay mike 4Head
[4:12:02] Artivicii: Or just buy it out and claim equity immediately 4Head
[4:12:31] Unvein: it all boils down to dti, debt to income. If its well over 50% you may not qualify for a LoC
[4:12:44] MagiMetal: with how prices in CA, not many would purchase outright

[4:14:59] Aidler: this raid looks like a lot of fun
[4:14:59] Bl4ckSauce: Yeap you need to have patience
[4:15:00] DemPorkChops: The escrow is just an account an attorney utilzes to hold money for a transaction so if the deal falls through a party can't walk off with the money, it stays its held in escrow until the deal is finalized. You dont want to make a big purchase on credit because the mortgage company / bank can decided up until closing to decline the mortgage, big purchase on credit would throw off your income to debt ratio.
[4:15:03] MrGattz: yeah you nailed it actually

[4:18:18] Thirtys3v3n: @Towelliee In Canada it goes in escrow, because once the offer is made it's binding. So a third party holds all the finds in trust until are terms of the sale are met. There are penalties to pulling out of an offer.
[4:18:31] Herzenliegen: That happen with our package but it was through Fed ex

[4:19:51] meady: jesus how fast have echo caught up
[4:20:00] Brathus11: @Towelliee it's like if you made a bet with someone, a third party holds the money so nobody changes their mind
[4:20:02] Jinjo219: escrow is for insurance and property taxes
[4:20:04] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee The Escrow is the Funds held by your Mortage Company to pay Home Owners Insurance and Property Taxes
[4:20:15] devolore: yeah they still send you the bill which is horrifying until you get the call from the escrow company that's like "oh btw we took care of that"
[4:20:25] maccaruso: Depends on the state but seems nice to have it rolled into one.
[4:20:29] duhworks: the escrow is just an account an attorney utilzes to hold money for a transaction so if the deal falls through a party can't walk off with the money, it stays its held in escrow until the deal is finalized. You dont want to make a big purchase on credit because the mortgage company / bank can decided up until closing to decline the mortgage, big purchase on credit would throw off your income to debt ratio. copy form dempork
[4:20:36] Jinjo219: I have escrow and love it, my property taxes are paid by my bank when its due
[4:20:40] MagiMetal: Escrow basically ensures the sellers time and good will on the purchase. From a loan perspective, things could fall through up until the last day, it gives them some security.
[4:20:41] mo197: it makes it easier and makes sure the man gets their cut
[4:20:43] Othala254: I would recommend you get HomeShield also. Covers the stuff your insurance won't. Dishwasher, fridge, AC unit etc.
[4:20:56] CDubTheRIPper: wtf, goblin gliders work in toghast?? LUL rip
[4:21:26] MagiMetal: The other escrow people are talking about is prepaying taxes/insurance every year and it getting spread across your yearly mortgage payments.

[7:03:40] lmaokyler: Rip up carpet and pad probably won’t cost much but flooring installation for hardwood is going to cost you around 3-7$a square foot depending on where you live. That’s just labor, cost of glue and flooring is another factor. I’ve been installing floors for 10 years, don’t go cheap
