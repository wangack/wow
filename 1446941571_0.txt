[0:25:58] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || They Just leaked the new expansion... youtu.be/rnGAz-sC0qg
[0:26:06] KragnosWoW: I hear ff can burn you out quick with the main story questline @CoffeeTwitcher
[0:26:34] CoffeeTwitcher: It has a higher slope for work vs reward
[0:26:48] CoffeeTwitcher: think a low slope gives instant gratification
[0:26:57] CoffeeTwitcher: you'll get a larger player base that way
[0:27:04] zulfikar0001: towOny
[0:27:37] CoffeeTwitcher: When you reach the top in FF you are revered wheter hated or admired you're still revered when you have put so much work into it and people see
[0:27:54] CoffeeTwitcher: because of the arduous challenge lol
[0:28:12] CoffeeTwitcher: not to say spamming raids over and over isnt challenging
[0:28:19] CoffeeTwitcher: I respect some of the grind here
[0:29:10] CoffeeTwitcher: we used to stay up days to get a death timer for 7 day window spawn Notorious Monsters and take shifts with groups to claim it and contact our friends to get on and help us take it down
[0:29:23] Thoreya: 2 weeks till Dragonflight announcement pog
[0:29:52] CoffeeTwitcher: and have a 5% drop rate on a ring or something gamebreaking from the monster lol
[0:30:05] KragnosWoW: @Thoreya the closer we get the more i hope we actually get a dragon themed class
[0:30:13] KragnosWoW: like dragon knight
[0:30:42] SSD511_: @thoreya hope it will be blast I’m waiting the good expansion to pull me back to wow

[0:30:52] Thoreya: same. the dragonflight leak said were gonna get like 4 new specs as clases, but i doubt that leak is legit
[0:31:37] darkeagle7561: 4 new specs? That would be awesome, but sounds like a lot
[0:31:56] Thoreya: ya like instead of 1 class with 3 specs, just 4 new classes with 1 spec each
[0:31:56] darkeagle7561: I would love an engineer type class/ spec
[0:32:08] CoffeeTwitcher: don't discount April Fools, Blizzard likes to be a Loki sometimes
[0:32:16] KragnosWoW: @CoffeeTwitcher Im just not a fan of the aesthetic overall of FF but glad u like it and prefer it.

[0:32:47] CoffeeTwitcher: I enjoyed WoW during 50 cap
[0:33:08] CoffeeTwitcher: got a paladin with fiery skull shield account out there in the abyss
[0:33:47] CoffeeTwitcher: hope the update is more than your wildest dreams :D !
[0:33:48] KragnosWoW: Legion was my favorite expansion but MoP is a hard second since that was the expansion I started my wow journey on. Wish i got to raid more in TBC classic but it is what it is, still had fun on it.
[0:34:32] Thoreya: if i dont get any tier set on my main today im gonna be very angry
[0:34:37] Thoreya: still have none on my mage
[0:36:22] pakamov: one of the biggest features of Legion that a lot of people overlook is the total overhawl of all specs and classes. This made it feel 10 times fresher than anything else. Hope we get something similar for 10.0
[0:36:57] KragnosWoW: I played demon hunter on release, was so fun

[1:59:01] dudeimunknown: 7500 anima to get full gear
[1:59:35] highlydegen: how do you think they will handle tier sets with season 4?
[2:00:07] 91Niki: We're going on an adventure HYPERS

[2:03:13] feherlofia123: the leak could be april fools
[2:03:29] pavepawns: its not
[2:03:55] Dagomarus: Do you think they will increase the Ilvl of the legos again in season 4?
[2:04:14] MrFuzzynuts420: @feherlofia123 it could be, but it's highly unlikely. Blizz is well known for "accidentally leaking" stuff just before expansion annoucement
[2:04:18] TheMysticBean: anyone know when we're getting the tier crafting system?
[2:04:34] TurtleThePunnyRabbit: Tell that to Diablo Immortal
[2:04:38] 91Niki: Anything outside April 1st is just straight up lying towRee
[2:04:39] Odinslayer: @Dagomarus its a  new season not a new tier

[2:05:00] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Something Ion would totally do
[2:05:01] Aidler: I still think it’s the title for the mobile WoW
[2:05:03] DeanoTV: noooooo
[2:05:10] highlydegen: it should've been called Dragon Age Kappa
[2:05:14] 91Niki: @Aidler sacHMM
[2:05:15] Dagomarus: @odinslayer true but theres no point in a new season without better gear surely?
[2:05:16] Melgor101: Reeeee
[2:05:23] TheCliffyShow: They are rebranding the game as Shadowlands Online.
[2:05:27] swordart2022: Warcraft mobile is may
[2:05:33] MrFuzzynuts420: honestly it would just piss players off even more. people are done with Blizz mind-games. they should be self aware enough to know that
[2:05:35] mytherel: @91Niki its still lying on 4/1 but for some reason it is acceptable
[2:05:43] WhiteKnight74648: World of Warcraft new expansion "Healing the woonz."

[2:06:05] Odinslayer: @Dagomarus they didn't say there will be an ilvl increase, just a new seaosn and ranks will reset with new mounts etc thats all
[2:06:16] 91Niki: @Gurtogg Get out
[2:06:25] WhiteKnight74648: @Gurtogg with the follow up WoW - Slyvannas's revenge

[2:06:34] mytherel: @91Niki sounds like a tuesday
[2:06:37] DarkVoice_: na reset in 2 hours?
[2:06:38] highlydegen: blink if you already know what the expansion is
[2:06:39] JediNeo99999: @Odinslayer It'd be pretty pointless to run anything if loot is the same though
[2:06:44] pavepawns: the reason its also just in general not an april fools is that they would never do a title that could be possible. it would be something dumb like World of Warcraft Azshara's Aquarium
[2:06:46] 91Niki: @mytherel True LUL
[2:07:07] Dagomarus: @odinslayer So we just grind raider io with no rewards part from a mount and title?

[2:37:57] Tokies: group has good heals and good dps. those jumps away were crispy from you
[2:38:02] Dagomarus: You were a true gamer to take on that dragon and win
[2:38:03] Lexi__Marie: watch them make you need a certain % before taking the portal Kappa
[2:38:30] CritcobainTV: Gushers are delicious
[2:38:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, good heals mean more breathing room and good dps means less time screwing around....pretty sweet
[2:39:06] Rudric_Ice: when you playing Fortnite Towelliee ?
[2:39:33] Luxembourger: you think that 10.0 will be released in Nov 2022? or 2023 only?
[2:40:13] jkitchin75: @Luxembourger defo not this year
[2:40:18] Lexi__Marie: ;iterally zero chance 10.0 is this year @Luxembourger
[2:40:20] SiXKiNG_: 2023 for sure
[2:40:25] Mallaes: The technique one
[2:40:25] Luxembourger: :(
[2:40:29] DarkVoice_: secret technique is pretty good
[2:40:29] CritcobainTV: the codex u wanted on your monk, and
[2:40:41] DarkVoice_: but on a dh you want codex
[2:40:46] Armdel: isn't Season 4 expected to start in like July/August
[2:40:52] highlydegen: Dn
[2:41:01] king_julian_96: i think 2023 to be honest only because we are having a season 4 for shadowlands later in the year if we did'nt have that then i would say 10.0 would come out this year
[2:41:01] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:41:28] highlydegen: how do you think they will handle tier sets for s4? how would you want them to handle it after this last tier
[2:41:29] swordart2022: 9.2.5 Jun July or it will not be with season.
[2:41:43] mavericks312: july would make sense thats 5 months in 9.2
[2:41:56] MrFuzzynuts420: Blizz did say that season 3 would just be a normal season length like they used to be so 3 months?
[2:42:08] swordart2022: @wooly858 You get them from what is now simple as that.
[2:42:22] swordart2022: @mrfuzzynuts420 Nope
[2:42:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: If we still have a year before 10.0, the seasons can be plenty long
[2:42:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || They Just leaked the new expansion... youtu.be/rnGAz-sC0qg
[2:43:07] highlydegen: its only month 4 of the year, still got a long way to 10.0
[2:43:15] bypized: @Towelliee so are we going to have an expac that has FLIGHT in the name, but we still will have to farm some sort of number to be able to fly?
[2:43:23] highlydegen: 10.0 late 2022 is my bet
[2:43:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 10.0 is not this year, it will be Jan/Feb 2023
[2:43:54] pr0ipseity: no shot it is this year
[2:43:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: especially since they announced a season 4
[2:44:22] mavericks312: i may need to make a blood elf pally for that 9.2.5 t mog set
[2:44:28] smashwow: that's assuming it's a 5 month season. and thus far we haven't gotten a 5 month season XD
[2:44:32] dankmeliodas: Probably August for season 4
[2:44:33] swordart2022: KEKW
[2:44:33] highlydegen: Dec 31 Release Kappa
[2:44:38] king_julian_96: how did you die
[2:44:40] king_julian_96: toweliee
[2:44:44] smashwow: they've got t retool a few dungeons and all the raids
[2:44:45] callum199724: has wow improved latey haven't played for about 7 months
[2:44:58] bypized: Spring 2023
[2:45:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: @mavericks312 That Blood Elf heritage set is probably going to be really good
[2:45:05] highlydegen: Blink once towellie if you already know the next expac name
[2:45:23] king_julian_96: or the 6.1 selfie patch
[2:45:24] c0mmander_starscream: @callum199724 no
[2:45:30] king_julian_96: i will never forget that
[2:45:31] Luxembourger: @wooly858 we all know the name already?
[2:45:37] PvtHudson093: If s4 comes out in August and roughly 6+ months of it. That means that 10.0 dosnt come out till March next year
[2:45:38] smashwow: that damn 6.1 patch
[2:45:38] The_Metal_Man: they did tho - we missed an entire patch. Anduin was supposed to be an end boss and jailer another end boss
[2:45:39] c0mmander_starscream: @callum199724 Ion is still on his coke binges
[2:45:42] highlydegen: the true name
[2:45:45] swordart2022: @callum199724 make own opinion LOL
[2:45:57] Luxembourger: @wooly858 Dragonflight
[2:46:02] bypized: @Towelliee so are we going to have an expac that has FLIGHT in the name, but we still will have to farm some sort of number to be able to fly?
[2:46:02] Noshpan: I think 6.1 was when I first let my WoW sub expire LUL
[2:46:10] Lexi__Marie: i understand that we have a while... but how about them genesis motes drop rates getting just a little bumperino
[2:46:12] c0mmander_starscream: StarCraft 3 will be out before 9.2
[2:46:31] Vendralos: Season 4 better be pretty damn good if we have to wait that long.
[2:46:31] mavericks312: i hit max level in WoD then quit the following week lol
[2:46:35] mrpresbaby: @c0mmander_starscream uh what? do you mean 9.2.5?
[2:46:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Leveling a Blood Elf just to cap is not a whole lot of time, it's probably worth it if you like transmogs
[2:46:39] king_julian_96: honestly i don't care if i have to wait till next year for 10.0 aslong as it is good
[2:46:49] rendmoore: yo, chat, coming back after a long break. What classes are a safe choice for DPS, meaning what classes doesnt get super op then nerfed then super op again. looking for something stable.
[2:47:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think I still need some levels on my Dark Iron dwarf
[2:47:13] mavericks312: @weirdo_dude do Dh's count lol
[2:47:16] smashwow: i still don't see how we're in season 4 until sept based on prior development timelines. adding affixes to ALL raids then re-tooling WoD dungeons for M+ while pushing out the .5 patch. seems like it'll take a bit. WoD had a compelete different tool kit. and those dungeons we picked (GrimRail) just is going to be awful period.
[2:47:21] swordart2022: @rendmoore check logs, raider io if you care for numbers
[2:47:24] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @SaraivaBrr (warning)
[2:47:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would assume that a DH would count if they are a Blood Elf, that would speed it up
[2:47:57] Vendralos: Old timelines are kinda out the window now
[2:48:08] Alegnowar: is it longer now?
[2:48:12] pavepawns: what is a timeline anyways
[2:48:18] pavepawns: we dont do that anymore
[2:48:20] smashwow: agreed. SL threw it out the window.
[2:48:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: When I did the other races for heritage sets, I used DK's and they had a higher starting level
[2:48:32] bypized: Cyberpunk timeline
[2:48:33] faulen: is that cause of Covid or Microsoft
[2:48:38] rendmoore: @fairplay2021 im worried about numbers but not looking for whats top tier right now. I'm looking for which classes have been middle to upper tier for multiple expansions if that's a thing
[2:48:39] smashwow: but based on that. SL dev cycles are longer now. that's my point
[2:48:41] OceanManCarter: If that is true that would be amazing
[2:48:45] highlydegen: what if we get 10.0 one year from now monkaW
[2:48:46] Thoreya: i was gonna say if its bc of covid damn that shits been 3 years now lol
[2:48:54] vintersorgSA: I can't trust them to put out anything good. They have a huge mountain of trust to climb.
[2:48:59] Vendralos: @SaraivaBrr Yeah, we on that Cyberpunk timeline OMEGALUL
[2:48:59] Templexx: Templexx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 4 month streak! yeezzzziirrrrr
[2:49:00] MrFuzzynuts420: true, Shadowlands really set the bar low for WoW expectations
[2:49:02] mavericks312: there not on a kotick timeframe now
[2:49:06] Noshpan: Kotick's got his golden parachute, so he don't care anymore.
[2:49:08] OceanManCarter: give us back blizzard of old "it's ready when it's ready"
[2:49:14] Zettabyte: Phil Spencer should get a character in game, @Towelliee Kappa
[2:49:16] ventu105: @towelliee you gonna stream the wow announcement the 19 of April?
[2:49:23] ItsUxorious: I just resub'ed to WoW. Got a lvl 60 havent played since last year. Anything cool to focus on? I heard mage towers were back?
[2:49:24] Thoreya: im still locking in my 10.0 prediction for jan/feb next year
[2:49:26] swordart2022: Weirdos in chat you play or not really that simple KEKW
[2:49:29] c0mmander_starscream: The's Devs timelines now depends on how much stuff they have to binge on Netflix in between their internal deadlines
[2:49:31] Arms_Warrior: hope we get a new mount achievement soon, highest has been 400 since antorus or something
[2:49:43] EmperorFredd: @Towelliee I think it fits if the new exp drops in q1 2023
[2:49:43] Thoreya: @ItsUxorious ya mage tower is up perm now
[2:49:49] mavericks312: @Thoreya im betting late january
[2:49:54] swordart2022: @itsuxorious do whatever catches your eye
[2:49:57] FrankTizzle: Casters are going to hate this week
[2:49:59] dankmeliodas: Earliest Feb but I’m calling March or April of next year
[2:49:59] FrankTizzle: :(
[2:50:08] MrFuzzynuts420: bolstering ain't bad anymore so i'm ready to tank this week
[2:50:13] c0mmander_starscream: Calling June Next year
[2:50:16] DarkVoice_: it might not be bolstering
[2:50:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Adding more achievements is an easy win for Blizzard, I would guess 9.2.5 will add a lot for people to do
[2:50:18] ItsUxorious: @Thoreya Cool. Is that something soloable? Never tried it
[2:50:21] jasperboy: what was the upcoming affixes u say?
[2:50:29] ventu105: @emperorfredd I think is the 1st quarter of 2023 dude
[2:50:31] billzulgurub: no biggie pulls on fortified ez 8x15s raidlog time
[2:50:34] DarkVoice_: we had it the first week

[2:51:30] ventu105: are servers down is he on EU server?
[2:51:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they can add 50 more achievements, like increasing the one for mounts, it gives people more things to do until 10.0

[2:58:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot warrior is a different style, with the shielding
[2:58:45] The_Metal_Man: I don't understand why they made warriors tankier instead of buffing dam
[2:58:46] Quakezilla69: I main warrior and I love tanking on him, but its so much easyer on my prot paladin
[2:58:57] Kleva1: get 226 conduits from zm too
[2:58:58] Scarhearth: Prot warrior is depressing this expac
[2:59:03] superdoekiller: @Towelliee does the game go down for reset?
[2:59:07] pereadin: So if we had 0 deaths we would have made the timer by only 33 seconds LOL

[3:03:00] CritcobainTV: USUALLY getting carried Kappa
[3:03:33] drazlok95: is pereadin a streamer or is he one of Towelliee's friends?
[3:03:35] jasperboy: I was usually getting carried, then i specced survival
[3:03:44] pereadin: @drazlok95 both
[3:03:47] Epixil: hey how many active subs you think wow got now?
[3:03:59] swordart2022: @jasperboy Year of the Spear Pog

[3:04:03] jasperboy: @Epixil 200 million
[3:04:13] tabd69: when does the vault open 15min or in 1h?
[3:04:14] Templexx: hell yea
[3:04:15] Scarhearth: I shouldve rerolled to hunter instead of enhancement shaman this tier LUL
[3:04:16] Sollice: more than 1 less than 1 billion
[3:04:22] Thoreya: @Epixil more than u think
[3:04:24] sakura_2020: about tree fiddy

[3:04:44] laaxxxd: what you think about ench shaman :)
[3:04:54] truetxn1987: so is Lost Ark dead officially?
[3:04:56] Thoreya: ever since 9.2 game seems to be much more alive
[3:04:57] 91Niki: Saying Towelliee always gets carried, is saying he never pulls his weight. So you're saying Shade carries him in Mythic prog, OK LUL
[3:05:01] Thoreya: at least anecdotally
[3:05:02] Sollice: @truetxn1987 What?
[3:05:03] pavepawns: brew is gonna get tier set
[3:05:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: From my experience, WoW is doing alright. On my server there are still plenty playing
[3:05:04] swordart2022: @truetxn1987 no
[3:05:10] jasperboy: My guess is, with how awesome 9.2 and the raid is, about 4-6mill maybe (?)
[3:05:13] tabd69: @Towelliee when does vault open?
[3:05:24] swordart2022: LUL
[3:05:24] pereadin: I'm going VDH -> UHDK -> Preist -> Shaman -> Paladin
[3:05:27] Templexx: oh shit. gratz to them
[3:05:28] falldrgn: This whole race was scuffed.. with the length
[3:05:33] king_julian_96: shutdown in 15
[3:05:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Last year at times my server was a ghost town, but these days it's fairly active
[3:05:42] pavepawns: i can confirm ur Brewmaster is geting tier set
[3:05:44] sifer007: KEKW
[3:05:45] jasperboy: I had BDGG as 5th on my Echo pickems. fucking hell
[3:05:58] pereadin: Halondy was such a great fight though
[3:06:10] pereadin: One of the best fights of all time
[3:06:13] Lulaboo: Holondrus was just fucking a brick wall
[3:06:13] jmalmin: If they did not nerf the crab... I do wonder how long the race would have been.
[3:06:14] Clicklesly: As a viewer i much prefer this to 8 days RWF though ^^
[3:06:15] Thoreya: sloot was up late talkin to the guildies
[3:06:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: send a crab dinner to his house during bruv night LUL
[3:06:26] jasperboy: I had Echo, Liquid, Method, Skyline, BDGG. Or BDGG > Skyline, cant remember. my pickems went to shit
[3:07:17] Scarhearth: any hunter experts here? Should i just stay night fae for survival or swap kyrian
[3:07:22] Clicklesly: I really wonder if anyone accurately predicted this order Kappa
[3:07:32] pavepawns: @Scarhearth m+ or raid?
[3:07:35] pavepawns: raid u want fae
[3:07:37] akia03: @Scarhearth for m+
[3:07:38] J_Rich94: This boss reminds me of the Vex Minds from Destiny
[3:07:41] swordart2022: @scarhearth costs you nothing to change play for yourself and see
[3:07:41] Scarhearth: M+ mainly
[3:07:42] king_julian_96: well it will be interestign to see how hard the first raid of 10.0 is assuming it's dargonflight
[3:07:43] Nolmac: Nolmac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 72 months, currently on a 72 month streak! 72 years!
[3:07:48] akia03: kyrian
[3:07:50] king_julian_96: dragonflight
[3:07:52] swordart2022: China going strong
[3:07:54] faulen: I dont think people know 5 Chinese guilds.
[3:07:57] SiXKiNG_: I stay fae just for ease but kyrian is better technically for m+
[3:07:58] dimofodi: Also didn't expect to see Liquid fall to 5 and only get that by purposely exploiting the bug.
[3:08:12] swordart2022: @scarhearth I play kyrian on surv feels nice
[3:08:17] pavepawns: @Scarhearth for m+ id honestly go fae for tyrannical weeks and kyrian for fortified just cause thats where ur dmg differs abit more
[3:08:18] Quakezilla69: china #1 first tier of next xpac
[3:08:31] Scarhearth: @dimofodi that was primarily burn out i think then the bug
[3:08:31] jasperboy: Dude, CN guilds just pull untill the boss dies, those dudes are fucking nuts
[3:08:39] akia03: and so much gold
[3:08:47] mavericks312: lets be honest china created gold lol
[3:08:47] The_Metal_Man: do they account share?
[3:08:55] king_julian_96: and wow tokens
[3:08:59] Kameellian: oh shit im in your party
[3:09:02] Kameellian: what an honor
[3:09:03] sifer007: china nr one
[3:09:06] king_julian_96: no wonder they  get so much gold
[3:09:08] truetxn1987: is there a healthy way to take gold out of the picture for the rwf?
[3:09:23] mavericks312: net isnt as stricted as blizz im guessing
[3:09:26] Sollice: @truetxn1987 Start with no BoEs
[3:09:31] Clicklesly: Tournament Realm, but that's never happening
[3:09:33] hawee11: Why wowprogress only show 5 guilds killed jailer
[3:09:38] swordart2022: @truetxn1987 why lol
[3:09:41] SiXKiNG_: @truetxn1987 no way, you would have to disable BoEs, loot trading, and everything else lol
[3:09:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: no boe's no tradeable loot, bring back master loot
[3:09:47] Clicklesly: Because it would also mean guild start the race fully geared
[3:09:50] Epixil: hey guys when can i kill jailer in raid finder?
[3:09:50] dimofodi: Tournament realm would remove gold entirely.
[3:09:52] Phantomstrk: don't forget that bron addon to turn off the music
[3:09:58] The_Metal_Man: My buddy from uni was from China and told me for every exam you pretty much have to cheat cause everyone does or else you're just behind
[3:10:05] pereadin: Time to go park the toons at the vault
[3:10:06] king_julian_96: well get rid of the wow token problem solved
[3:10:19] mavericks312: tournament realm would kill the race
[3:10:21] lumaday: master loot would be a healthier solution?
[3:10:23] dimofodi: Oh it isn't realistic but it owuld remove the gold is all.
[3:10:30] Azukh: towBolvar
[3:10:53] Sollice: So if I have done nothing in ZM, do I have to wait weeks to grind flying or can i get it right away
[3:10:54] Epixil: when can i fly in zereth mortis?
[3:10:59] Clicklesly: Unless there's a TR for raid without vendors, just with copied chars
[3:10:59] faulen: tournment realm but with only normal gear.
[3:11:00] dimofodi: Then they get to go to a LIVE server and do it all over again! :D
[3:11:03] truetxn1987: or just make boe's a mid tier release for a catchup mech to casuals

[3:11:19] 91Niki: @Sollice You can do that right away. It's a set of achivs
[3:11:23] DeanoTV: nah u need to find alot of chests and kill alot of rares for flying too
[3:11:24] Sollice: ty
[3:11:27] DeanoTV: i gave up with it
[3:11:29] megazeusthor: just get a buddy to fly you around and get hcests
[3:11:32] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee  The new Playstation Plus games Sony added to my library are meh, Its old shit I've already played to death and beaten
[3:11:33] king_julian_96: how long are the servers goign to be down for
[3:11:33] dimofodi: Nope just finish the campaign and do the minimal stuff required and you fly.
[3:11:38] king_julian_96: after shutdown
[3:11:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Zereth Mortis quest autopops when you're going through campaign quests, I think
[3:11:47] 91Niki: @Sollice https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-flying-riding-pathfinder that has ZM too
[3:11:52] swordart2022: @deanotv How you managed to pog in if you can't even so quests KEKW
[3:11:59] swordart2022: *log in
[3:12:01] mavericks312: there werent any boe's this tier was there?
[3:12:04] DeanoTV: @dimofodi i done mosts the quests i still dont have flying
[3:12:05] dimofodi: BOE was negligible. It was buying tier stacks and tier pieces etc.
[3:12:09] Sollice: Thank you @91Niki
[3:12:10] Epixil: what do the top raiders spend so much gold on? is it mainly BoEs?
[3:12:10] CritcobainTV: did u see the nerfs to streets?
[3:12:12] chrisrgn: most boes are basically transmog
[3:12:16] akia03: pvp boosts cost allot for them
[3:12:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: The only tricky part in flying there is finding all the little scrolls, but there are guides to help with those
[3:12:35] CritcobainTV: @akia03 ? most RWF guilds have rank 1pvpers that carry them
[3:12:39] CritcobainTV: like Trill
[3:12:40] itztbg: Do you have any guides on how to tank mythic+ dungeons?
[3:12:48] faulen: tournament realm but with only normal gear. pauseChamp

[3:12:58] akia03: thats what was listed on there expense post
[3:13:05] Epixil: Trill is basically the god of WoW

[3:18:01] CritcobainTV: LFR anduin KEKW
[3:18:08] Phantomstrk: i got anduin helm from my vault last week for my LFR run lol
[3:18:09] CritcobainTV: @mmrghost7 not even close to true
[3:18:10] akia03: the new shaman shapes sell well
[3:18:10] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[3:18:12] Arms_Warrior: does tier look the same in all difficulties?
[3:18:15] theDirtyon3: yes it is
[3:18:16] Thoreya: gonna be doing lfr on 6 chars for tier today
[3:18:20] dimofodi: 4 piece is 100% worth LFR
[3:18:20] Fugazi811: it is
[3:18:21] bigb0omer: it is def worth it
[3:18:21] theDirtyon3: that guy is not thinking
[3:18:22] Creative_Pigeon: unless you need tier gloves for 4 piece.
[3:18:23] Merkuriuz: it rly is worth it
[3:18:25] Thoreya: cant wait to be disappointed
[3:18:27] swordart2022: People so Pepega in chat
[3:18:29] mmrghost7: if u are a tank no
[3:18:31] tommysavagex: depends on the class probably
[3:18:33] sweexie: It is
[3:18:34] Vendralos: It's VERY worth hit
[3:18:34] mavericks312: lords and ryg, i think are 246
[3:18:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: With the 4 piece sets being so strong, it's probably worth it. I agree
[3:18:39] bigb0omer: who said that!? a person that doesn't have tier im assuming
[3:18:41] swordart2022: See item lvl any thing they can read KEKW
[3:18:41] dranet11: Clueless
[3:18:42] jaffybara: Depends on the 2 set, 4 set 100% worth it
[3:18:42] vyjinx: how am i going to complete a full set when stuck at 1 set item HUH ?
[3:18:43] Sttarrkz: not for dh dps xD
[3:18:47] mavericks312: set bonus > ilvl
[3:19:03] vyjinx: def not gonna replace stuff with lfr shit just to get set
[3:19:08] pereadin: completing 4 set > EVERYTHING
[3:19:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you're a blood DK or a guardian druid, totally worth it....their 4 piece bonuses are huge
[3:19:10] ArcaneSyntax: the DPS loss from 265 to 239 is like 40, the 2pc/4pc is like 30%
[3:19:24] swordart2022: Reading too hard for some Pepega
[3:19:37] smashwow: we'd be wearing shard gear if they didn't deactivate them from SoD
[3:19:41] Vendralos: So what? LOL
[3:19:44] TheCliffyShow: I have 246 tier shoulders that I plan on using when I get a piece to go with it for 4-set. They will be replacing 252 shoulders.
[3:19:45] Vendralos: I think that's cool
[3:19:48] The_Metal_Man: nothin wrong with that
[3:19:50] king_julian_96: well technially there is'nt toweliee cause we not getting a new raid in season 4 it's just the current 3 shadowlands raids with higher ilvl
[3:20:01] Vendralos: It makes older raids actually matter moving forward
[3:20:03] TheCliffyShow: I think the tier bonuses make things more interesting.
[3:20:04] Gurtogg: just disable old tier bonuses in the new raid
[3:20:08] dimofodi: @Towelliee with them talking about all 3 raids being in season 4, how do you think they'll handle tier sets and domination socket gear etc?
[3:20:11] The_Metal_Man: better cause it at least gives semi-permanence to the gear you grind for
[3:20:13] xTuHypeD: i like combined old and new tier just annoying to get if ur new
[3:20:21] mavericks312: M+ nathria is gonna be amazing
[3:20:24] 91Niki: @king_julian_96 He just said there isn't. He was making an example lol
[3:20:36] vanillahobbit: i hope no domination shards s4
[3:20:38] bagrain: lol got a 2 key in with 15secs to spare
[3:20:51] swordart2022: @dimofodi what? there is gear if you want go get it, domination gear doesn't work already
[3:20:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are some buffs and nerfs today, yeah
[3:20:59] akia03: tier pieces with dom sockets oh great
[3:21:03] lmtheboogie: just got "strange goop" to drop after about 1500 casts. got it right before the shutdown!
[3:21:11] theDirtyon3: lmao those names
[3:21:25] mavericks312: sire supplier best name of the xpac lol
[3:21:25] Thoreya: dom sockets 2.0 = irrelevant
[3:21:28] swordart2022: Sounds boring
[3:21:31] Thoreya: bring on the s4 m+!
[3:21:32] king_julian_96: probably be higher then 278
[3:21:42] theDirtyon3: Demo lock nerf Sadge
[3:21:42] Vendralos: Imagine having vendors for M+ and Raid gear.
[3:21:51] mavericks312: look at that frost mage
[3:21:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Demonology is freak mode, yeah lol
[3:21:55] king_julian_96: if they increase the ilvl of all gear liek they have done every season
[3:21:56] mmrghost7: surprisingly frost dk is winning
[3:21:57] solsaver12: oO frost dk looking good
[3:22:00] szble: frost dks gotta be happy
[3:22:05] dimofodi: @fairplay2021 My point is in season 4 they're making all 3 raids viable again increasing gear ilvl etc. How is that going to work with dom socket gear. Would it just not be useful and only tier items are? Etc
[3:22:06] elirank9: demo is pi target so its infalted
[3:22:09] Thoreya: firee mage got that juicy buff coming in today
[3:22:09] solsaver12: yup I'm happy

[3:22:47] RealInsanoid: below feral druids must be sad
[3:22:48] ArcaneSyntax: survival hunter and enhancement in the top5 this patch is wild.
[3:22:49] racketpunch: Damn they did my Outlaw rogue dirty
[3:23:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even with a 35% nerf, bears are still going to be running hard, yes
[3:23:24] Thoreya: bears still gonna crank ok ok
[3:23:27] Thoreya: thats cool
[3:23:32] smashwow: the ST nerf they did to bear without buffing their ST abilities is dirty though. the MT nerf completely warranted
[3:23:34] Thoreya: at least they didnt get gutted
[3:23:40] FrankTizzle: WHY FIRE MAGES?!
[3:23:43] FrankTizzle: WHY NOT ARCANE?!
[3:23:46] FrankTizzle: BibleThump
[3:23:55] Thoreya: yesss fire mage buffs

[3:25:04] GTmask: wait Ret buff? not April fools' ?
[3:25:08] snake_like: rogue changes are always so small. bliz 100% hates rogues rofl
[3:25:20] nofunksgiven1: @Towelliee Demo's parses are skewed due to the top 95-99% parses getting multiple power infusions, if you look at Parses without Pi they are on par with other classes
[3:25:31] Thoreya: pirate dragon too tough
[3:25:35] trickyshot_: Streets got giga nerfed
[3:25:42] alex12645: rets did look like they need a buff

[3:27:03] Thoreya: you get nerf, you get a nerf
[3:27:12] The_Metal_Man: those nerfs to the packs before the market are huge
[3:27:23] Kinghorn: sounds like both
[3:27:29] Valaurus: and composition,. that sounds like numbers to me too
[3:27:32] Kinghorn: lgwShrug
[3:27:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Good stuff
[3:27:41] king_julian_96: no i think trash wil just be easier to kill
[3:28:01] Drumac_: That would be cool if it was a randomizer so every time you enter a dungeon or raid it's different.
[3:28:03] The_Metal_Man: I would bet that pat before the market when you go north probably doesnt pat as far or as wuick anymore
[3:28:05] akia03: @Towelliee  have you seen the chinese strat for the pirate dragon?
[3:28:13] Thoreya: premade m+ boutta be flooded with Streets keys today
[3:28:17] Eregbueye: @classicfluffy idk man, im no keyer, but +17 was a joke to heal this week

[3:29:35] dranet11: legion bear was so nice
[3:29:37] Armdel: he died alot so therefore they are bad
[3:29:38] pavepawns: guardians are op as fuck
[3:29:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Demon Hunter has been #1 most of the expansion, but yeah guardian was never bad
[3:29:43] Kinghorn: 100%
[3:29:45] swordart2022: True KEKW
[3:29:45] NippponSteel: Bear has been amazing almost the entire expansion of SL LUL

[3:29:54] onous_: He has no idea how to tank is what I heard.
[3:29:56] mavericks312: delusional player spoted lol
[3:30:00] Gingerprimer: Dude swaps to a meta class each patch and get mad when nerfed
[3:30:03] TheCliffyShow: That's why you don't follow the flavor of the month.
[3:30:27] iamWaritself: So'Leah is super easy
[3:30:28] aminus: no soleah is last gambit boss
[3:30:30] Triist0ne: at higher keys i would say so
[3:30:31] Vinoyuhuu: soleah is ez
[3:30:31] pavepawns: our guilds main tank can legit do 250k before nerf so a 50% wouldnt even hurt him
[3:30:34] abracka_: matching shapes is hard
[3:30:34] swordart2022: Hooktaio does barely anything
[3:30:35] The_Metal_Man: collapsing star boss
[3:30:37] Gingerprimer: Nah last gambit boss
[3:30:42] Eregbueye: @classicfluffy you know better then, great job ! the rp in this dungeon is annoying af tho thats for sure
[3:30:57] warrenny: Hooktsil is worse when tanks stupid
[3:31:15] Draz3nx: MW top healing in echo world 1st
[3:31:16] classicfluffy: @Eregbueye yup, big agree :D
[3:31:18] Thoreya: blood dk is doing dam too
[3:31:22] Fugazi811: he is right about the PI
[3:31:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear tank is still going to blast, yeah
[3:31:24] Hood______: Fundamentally, you shouldn't balance class specs around some other class' spell tho
[3:31:33] swordart2022: Just Baddies whining
[3:31:37] NippponSteel: this isn't the last season tho....
[3:31:39] N3llee: @Towelliee see the Lost Ark Road Map?
[3:31:43] felinesanonymous: Wait so whats going on with the new WoW expansion

[3:31:51] Eregbueye: lol
[3:31:56] Scoodles91: tank druids think they have to beat the dps in overall dmg....
[3:31:57] cdk058: same
[3:32:02] NippponSteel: we should just off her as a character
[3:32:05] alex12645: thats why you put the druids in the ignore corner
[3:32:10] senioryoshii: pi is the problem look at demo without pi
[3:32:11] TheCliffyShow: I will never get tired of Sylvanas.
[3:32:16] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee did you see how mad the EX limit raider has been on twitter?
[3:32:16] classicfluffy: @Scoodles91 and meanwhile dk tanks rising :D
[3:32:19] 91Niki: It's like the whole oscar drama, NOBODY CARES ANYMORE ResidentSleeper
[3:32:23] Vendralos: @Scoodles91 To be fair, most tanks feel like they should do as much damage as DPS players xD
[3:32:32] ro9ue: Lol they still didn’t explain
[3:32:35] Gurtogg: mommy sylvanas FeelsGoodMan

[3:34:23] GamerGoat56: HotPokket
[3:34:25] bigb0omer: its worse in game
[3:34:27] stallowned: looks sooo much better
[3:34:28] MILESkg21: DAFUQ OMEGALUL
[3:34:32] dimofodi: It looks amazing but it's also one thing to do a 2D picture and 3D model.
[3:34:35] Vendralos: Druid looks sick
[3:34:35] NippponSteel: Good artists dont get jobs where they can design like that
[3:34:42] 91Niki: @Towelliee the printer ran out of ink
[3:34:50] NippponSteel: they will make a design like that then it will go through reviews and end up a hobo cloth
[3:34:58] PotatoWin: I dont like either
[3:35:01] thasch: insane how blizzard employs dope ass artists yet freelances outhere designing better armor than blizz..
[3:35:03] Gingerprimer: TBF the artist even said they can be more creative since they are not bound by engine limitations
[3:35:05] Kushemz: Whats this he's looking at?
[3:35:08] Tokies: It also feels more like the class.
[3:35:32] ro9ue: Could’ve at least made that the mythic version
[3:35:33] ZabberzTV: like the warrior seething with rage looks amazing
[3:35:40] 91Niki: That art right there isn't limited by engine
[3:35:41] faulen: reflective lights
[3:35:44] lumaday: @ZabberzTV agreeee
[3:35:45] ArcaneSyntax: reminder that art is one thing, implementing is another.
[3:35:53] Novirtue_: now imagine the lag with 100 of these running around in oribos
[3:35:58] j_bar111: it looks to generic
[3:35:59] Vendralos: 100%
[3:36:02] shiny_flaaffy: to be fair that art is the normal mode art too
[3:36:06] Tokies: they went with the patch and not the rpg class. Agreed
[3:36:09] theSalute: omg yeah
[3:36:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there is already gear with glowing stuff and colored hazes coming off the gear
[3:36:16] theSalute: uldir was so ugly hahaha :(
[3:36:20] 91Niki: It isn't even reflective light that will make a difference, it's just more details
[3:36:20] NippponSteel: As an artist, my original vision vs what i actually get green lit to produce is vastly different
[3:36:25] 91Niki: and colors
[3:36:26] DehCantao: TBH, I cant recognize some of the classes on the blizzard version
[3:36:34] inj0shwetrust: all the armor this xpac looks like they forged it from old pennies
[3:36:37] stjon13: kinda looks like Protos armor
[3:36:38] Fugazi811: mage and warlock way better
[3:36:38] its____rooster: demon hunter could have been better

[3:38:19] Wcvechten: it'll port you into a mythic halondrus fight
[3:38:27] The_Metal_Man: isn't reclaimed a similar name to an 8.X affix?
[3:38:27] Eregbueye: you need to carry a star through the whole key

[3:39:52] mavericks312: id say 9.2.5 will drop about july and get them back on the 5 month rotation
[3:40:04] alex12645: so many guilds are quiting mythic raiding because there adding mythic+ to raids
[3:40:15] MrFuzzynuts420: it's 8.3 all over again with 8 months of season 4
[3:40:20] felinesanonymous: ascension wow already has that tho
[3:40:21] Vendralos: Good.. I need to play with my Horde bros
[3:40:27] mavericks312: just with the cross faction
[3:40:27] pavepawns: dont trust gnomes though
[3:40:33] Phantomstrk: if 9.2.5 is the "last patch" of this expansion, then it'll have to carry us to next april, provided that's when 10.0 comes out, so i think 9.2.5 won't be out until later this year, probably september
[3:40:33] skeletorsyourdad: there really is no horde and alliance anymore
[3:40:35] Templexx: yea things are gonna get weird
[3:40:35] The_Metal_Man: imma die hard horde guy but fuck me they've needed xfaction since WoD
[3:40:41] felinesanonymous: so why after so many expacs did they do it
[3:40:45] Eregbueye: vulperas
[3:40:46] Phantomstrk: question is, does 9.2.5 also mean season 4 ?
[3:40:46] Templexx: also gonna be a lot of funny shit talking
[3:40:47] Vendralos: Hey man, Nelfs are cool
[3:40:48] faulen: and GIGACHAD Dwarfs

[3:40:50] Wcvechten: Goblin, Gnome and Vulpera only groups please
[3:40:51] lithium364: female draenei only
[3:40:52] AltDaniBB: Im down for it, I think alliance races are much cooler
[3:40:56] Neckro89: Alliance might actually be able to clear a raid now KEKW
[3:40:57] MrFuzzynuts420: ew i have to play with vulpera? WutFace
[3:41:00] jmalmin: A tauren and a Mecha Gnome tanking raids :)
[3:41:00] trickyshot_: I just can't wait to see " +15 no alliance "
[3:41:02] Gingerprimer: @Phantomstrk ppl think so but nothing confirmed

[3:41:17] daddyslugnasty: what will happen to pvp?
[3:41:29] Cloheart: Hey friends, would now be a good time to come back for Mage Tower, or should I wait?
[3:41:30] Effin_Steffin: How woulda 9.2.5 work with mailing to cross faction alts?
[3:41:31] xXSiebzehnXx: One of the only games that has been out so long that the warring factions worked it out LUL
[3:41:33] Cloheart: been gone for a few years
[3:41:44] faulen: the economy is to bad on alliance
[3:41:49] alexssd: When is this cross faction thing happening?
[3:41:49] Wcvechten: for some races maybe that are big on racials
[3:41:50] felinesanonymous: @Towelliee Ascension WoW already has that shit - so why after so many expacs did Blizz do it.
[3:41:50] Gurtogg: did you see the new dark iron dwarf wepons for 9.2.5
[3:41:50] AltDaniBB: DPS need orc and troll racial so prob not
[3:41:50] The_Metal_Man: they'll have characters that swap for better racials
[3:41:50] mavericks312: i dont think so
[3:41:53] neverbeenhip: whatwhat would the real benefits be?
[3:41:54] pavepawns: i like my orcs too much
[3:41:55] Gingerprimer: @Cloheart if you want to do the MT do it
[3:41:55] reggiepowa: if guilds become cross faction a lot of people will
[3:41:58] Decoy101: Max said quite a few of his guild would prefer to be alliance so we may seem some people on Liquid swap
[3:41:59] stallowned: horde has better pve racials dont they?
[3:41:59] swordart2022: @faulen stop lying
[3:41:59] endobleedz: think max said no
[3:42:01] wrhashwizard: my guild switched factions
[3:42:02] infinityarty: if they can cross faction mythic raid, some classes might benifit more from alliance racials
[3:42:04] CritcobainTV: Why would they though. If they wanted to be alliance they'd just do it now
[3:42:05] pronkk_: its a sound way to pretty much guarantee Hall of Fame @Towelliee
[3:42:08] TY_Dunston: i see more PVP's going alliance than raiders
[3:42:11] mavericks312: yea the convos were good
[3:42:12] Sluggs_: they rely alot on the horde community to gear up they cant swap with way gearing works
[3:42:17] The_Metal_Man: @stallowned someimtes the dwarf racial is giganice for the bleed clear
[3:42:19] TY_Dunston: PVPers
[3:42:20] pereadin: I hear of guilds considering opening a community to have both ally and horde guild members but have at least 14 raiders for mythic as one faction to get hall of fame and achievements
[3:42:22] Scarhearth: when I used to tank for my guild i was a vulpera and my offtank was a tauren :P
[3:42:26] Armdel: Think some people might switch simply for nelf for high m+
[3:42:31] faulen: @fairplay2021 i mean for boasts and stuff that is all required for the Race.
[3:42:33] DehCantao: isnt that conversation an april fools joke?

[3:45:21] CritcobainTV: @vadder_fister what is a "shid"
[3:45:44] MrFuzzynuts420: Yeah it’s so dumb they’re doing the catalyst a month after season release
[3:45:48] CritcobainTV: I just googled Shid, apparently you just took a piece of firewood that is about 4 feet long
[3:45:49] Jewishraver: is it TW week?
[3:45:57] vadder_fister: @Critcobain kaka
[3:46:05] DeanoTV: should of just waited a month to resub after patch with all the timegating LULL
[3:46:14] Zendero89: TW is next week. its WQ week now
[3:46:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: And then with the creation catalyst, there is an energy system...so you're only making one tier set piece per week....so pick the right one! lol
[3:46:42] Merkuriuz: eventually you will be able to make 1 part every 2 days :D
[3:47:02] MrFuzzynuts420: Blizz loves their timegating. They clearly learned nothing from the whole conduit energy thing
[3:47:02] Vendralos: @weirdo_dude Jesus, that sounds like Blizzard
[3:47:53] its____rooster: legion m+ this week new dungs?
[3:48:02] KragnosWoW: 1 week per tier piece until you collect all pieces of exodia and then u get your tier bonus Kappa

[5:39:51] sinlesssinner: you think Liquid is going to name change again lol
[5:39:55] mavericks312: interesting
[5:39:57] Rakim88: liquid still got massive viewership
[5:40:03] Reckless_Monk: He already spoke about it
[5:40:10] Nimz83: I thought Max was one of the main people
[5:40:21] sinlesssinner: @Rakim88 they gotta keep being good tho, if they drop to 3rd its over
[5:40:24] Reckless_Monk: If Liquid said "Why 5th? keep going" Max said they would all drop Liquid as an org
[5:40:27] Aidler: scripe also hinted he won’t do another RWF without global release
[5:40:27] Rakim88: sponsor do pay for viewership. liquid got that.
[5:40:32] sinlesssinner: method and pieces are right behind
[5:40:34] raldrik: sponsors pay for eyeballs. It doesnt matter how they finish if they have the eyes on the stream

[5:41:28] Alegnowar: imagine if it worked that way LUL those org would not be where they are now
[5:41:29] mavericks312: I would think with 10.0 if liquid places outta the top 3 liquid could make some changes
[5:41:39] extrnl2: i would think having viewers matters to an advertiser/sponsor, but viewers wont last if you aren't any good
[5:41:43] phigment: @Towelliee why arent you a World first raider?
[5:41:45] jerseyfive: method would bank so much now if the thing did not happen PepeClap

[5:43:23] turfjitsu: cause we love ya
[5:43:29] Sollice: I remember the hyper x days lol
[5:43:37] extrnl2: makes sense - need more than 0 viewers, but having the most vs 10th most may not matter
[5:43:42] faulen: micro communities with influence are worth much more than giga communities
[5:44:01] CritcobainTV: wonder if they fixed LFR yet LUL

[5:44:34] Djfarmville: susceptibility mroe important yeah
[5:44:39] ohnot___her: What does winning a WF race have to do w/ sponsorship tho? If
[5:44:41] Aidler: towelliee has the viewers with the deep pockets let the other streamers have the kids…. lol
[5:44:42] Thoreya: yup
[5:44:48] chrslp: Wasnt Asmon not even officially included in the New World launch event
[5:45:08] Alegnowar: big streamers just take the sponsor money doing the bare minimum to promote them
[5:45:08] Djfarmville: adin ross LULW
[5:45:09] Gingerprimer: It also depends of what demographic your viewership consists of. Like if your viewers are older they have more spending money to spend on sponsors products
[5:45:12] CritcobainTV: @chrslp i think that was lost ark, pretty sure he did NEW stuff didn't he?
[5:45:13] extrnl2: yeah like theres a bunch of people with 1-3k steady community, and 30k viewer hype streamers that dont actually havem uch engagement from a sponsor perspective
[5:45:16] CritcobainTV: NW*
[5:45:22] chrslp: @Critcobain Yea LA sorry
[5:45:22] mavericks312: @chrslp nope

[5:45:53] Henke1983: i hear you talking about asmons viewers :D

[5:47:10] chrslp: If you see OTK squad, price goes up LUL
[5:47:20] im_mezzro: Towellie dont you have an issue with promotion of games like new world that were actually awful but streamers talked about how good it was. I don't blame streamers for taking money but yea
[5:47:38] Aidler: I also think Towelliee has a more mature viewership (economically more valuable viewers) then other streamers
[5:47:52] CritcobainTV: New World was a good game until all the bugs showed up. The game had a lot of issues but it was still a fun game
[5:47:53] Gingerprimer: @Aidler yeah big factor
[5:48:03] Thoreya: i told everyone NW was just a fad for streamers to get paid with drops
[5:48:08] Thoreya: which was pretty much the case
[5:48:12] Alllprimer: Alllprimer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[5:48:22] chrslp: Im pretty sure the BIG streamers have mostly kids as their viewers so they cant even buy from sponsored links and stuff
[5:48:26] Chuckforfun: I will level up new in new world because my server is dead and i transfer already ;D
[5:48:27] CYNIC308: yea minus the gold dupes and the boring end end game loop New World is a pretty great game
[5:48:39] darkdestroz: @Towelliee just did +2  7 deaths and my BDK was getting spanked, shows how crapp geard  it is xD
[5:48:53] Reckless_Monk: And then theres Raid: Shadow Legends :x
[5:48:55] jerseyfive: i would promote tampons if the money is right...

[5:50:48] Rakim88: one day Sadge
[5:50:49] phigment: What about a WoW sponsored stream but you have to play Shadow Priest?

[5:59:55] boopbopbamski: ya i dont think blizz is going to mvoe away from it we will have something just like covenants in the next xpack
[5:59:58] Kisswani: I mean , it'll be fine if it was like 9.1.5 covenants
[5:59:59] bumpstock75: PLEASE NO

[6:00:20] boopbopbamski: i think it was a good idea they just time gated it and made it soo u pretty much cant change

[6:01:20] Eviltuna13: In my opinion the best thing to be rolled over from expansion to expansion is WQ dailies
[6:01:34] Velashen: There needs to be more than just transmogs and mounts that carry over. Maybe housing would help.

[6:02:23] JayGodd: Sorry if this is a dumb question, is there a way to get the name plate frames but also keep the original wow skillbar?
[6:02:25] at1c: Just copy paste Wildstart housing
[6:02:25] pronkk_: wha would you call garrison though?
[6:02:27] MILESkg21: close as we'll ever get
