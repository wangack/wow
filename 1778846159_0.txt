[1:46:01] Sykum: punishes priests and warlocks
[1:46:05] dimofodi: you need someone in your group and then /range 10 and put them on the edge of the range circle
[1:46:31] max3107: 50% slow though
[1:46:37] Snabido: Oh it has a stun too?
[1:46:52] Strxin: dks are going to have a bad time with it because they terrible mobility. üòÇ
[1:47:00] Sykum: a slow and a stun on breaking?
[1:47:04] Sch1ey: I think this affix is going to be a lot easier then people think. A lot to deal with it
[1:47:09] maustercheese: the stun is only if one fails to get out of range in time

[1:53:43] ShadoodHD: would diminishing return apply to this mob?
[1:53:51] Marts1: Really really want shorter Interupt cooldown as Hunter in PVE.... sometimes its so frustrating
[1:54:16] CGd0c: banish/cyclone
[1:54:22] Sch1ey: no failure damage
[1:54:36] ElmSpace: could miss damage or healing checks because of it
[1:54:39] ArcaneSyntax: Honestly these seem less punishing.
[1:54:41] KisShadi: how long does the debuff stay tho
[1:54:41] Sch1ey: incorp 100%
[1:54:47] Ertra: volcanic was so ez
[1:54:49] dreamwalker213: Volcanic was free af
[1:54:50] kimmo_gaming: we cant say that now :D

[1:55:10] ArcaneSyntax: Ii want sanguine gone üòì
[1:55:20] Zeke_nl: neither of the new affixes are free like volcanic
[1:55:21] Marts1: it could fuck u but then you just  were stupid

[1:57:23] ArcaneSyntax: Quaking is way more annoying.
[1:57:29] Marts1: The 50% slow should not be there
[1:57:35] Sykum: if it  constatnly targets ranged
[1:57:38] Bama05: You keep asking about what‚Äôs worse; what about what‚Äôs fun? When the healer doesn‚Äôt heal it to full and the dps lose 100% haste he‚Äôs gunna get roasted by the group
[1:57:42] Marts1: 20% maybe
[1:57:51] max3107: the slow will be really annoying
[1:57:55] LuiBMHunter: fine for a hunter :)
[1:58:08] Sykum: healers will eat it

[1:58:34] Bama05: It pushes people away from playing when it‚Äôs not fun, and comparing these to pally tanks is a joke, paladin is a utility tank‚Ä¶ warrior and dk and bear won‚Äôt be able to do so
[1:58:44] Naturalbeef: I wonder if Fel Rush untangles you
[1:58:54] Thoreya: @Bama05 u can leap the entangle prob..

[2:00:08] Chiraakitteh: Bears can powershift back into bear, pretty low danger unless they‚Äôre lagging
[2:00:25] Bama05: Snares are mostly gunna be wrong time wrong place I think
[2:00:31] skulldrag03: Inspired
[2:00:36] Marts1: Something I think about is what combos we can get ? Cause I feel many thinks we will see all 3 active at the same time
[2:00:37] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee incorporeal should work like the cc adds on Raz
[2:00:40] wraaith: @Chiraakitteh power shift is dead as its on GCD
[2:00:42] Chiraakitteh: Wow, forcing dps to use cc... unheard of!

[2:01:41] Zeke_nl: the comments are hilarious

[2:01:42] cretorstv: Because that's what people want..
[2:01:48] Inthezonewow: Because Bellular said they should have kiss/curse, so it's just parroting what they've heard

[2:02:11] cretorstv: The only affixes people really enjoy are the ones that are really easy or the seasonals - Should look into what people liked previously
[2:02:11] Snabido: Aint the chest at the end enough kiss? üòè
[2:02:17] Bama05: Because of how they said it, no seasonal and looking at lvl 7‚Ä¶ implied there would be more kiss curse

[2:02:34] acedaevil: ok
[2:02:46] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  entangling should not be partnered with sanguine or spiteful
[2:02:51] max3107: agree
[2:02:54] PrimalRain: I'd be ok with that too. Just make the dungeon very hard.
[2:03:27] Marts1: I think they should remove tyra fort and make each week about affixes, not if you like bosses or trash
[2:03:29] Mecabeast: I think they did ok with the heroic + affixs on wrath classic
[2:03:29] Daarksyde: would it be nuts for one week if Tyranical and Fort was same week... now all the nerds would complain but it would be fun!
[2:03:56] Bashiel: nah, but some of them having positive effects would be cool
[2:04:00] Aidler: In the end what everyone really wants is a 3 chest easy run
[2:04:06] aizensouzukee: the only thing that affixes should not do is mess with mobs that cant be moved, besides that its all ok
[2:04:20] smol_gunner: the only problem with affixes, they dont add value to the gameplay
[2:04:29] Bayne77: obviously
[2:05:06] Sandisy: affixes make every season feel same as the last with a change of scenery. make each individual dungeon interesting instead, imo

[2:06:54] Kimdah_: Little effort, big reward
[2:07:02] GodKingMuninn: I don't like when affixes are more focused on a specific role's job. More affixes need to be team effort focused where you can handle them in multiple ways
[2:07:09] Marts1: I think my biggest problem there are weeks that you really dont wanna play, or tyra is too hard for some ( or the lenght of boss fights are insane long )
[2:07:44] phattboi_80: as if healers don't have enough bullshit to deal with in dungeons already KEKW

[2:21:28] Bayne77: i wonder if blizz could make that a selection for players to make.  like when you go into the dungeon and plug the key in, you either choose to play with the affixes or a scaled up tyrannical/fort
[2:21:54] George2001k: Is it a weak aura or an addon that shows what classes are in a mythic plus group in lfg;
[2:22:08] abracka_: the path of least resistance would always be chosen
[2:22:40] Bayne77: and that might be the play.   to have the better rewards in with the affixes @Towelliee
[2:22:47] Chiraakitteh: They DO give more rewards for dealing with their affixes
[2:22:59] FerociouzMonk: nerf addons.
[2:23:01] 2naDlisch: Maybe unlock another piece of gear at the end of the dungeon for dealing with the affixes
[2:23:04] Exodeo_: sounds like pet battles
[2:23:40] motorboatingpro: i like the idea where its only tyr/fort, that rewards you basic loot as is -- then you opt into the week's affixes for more loot and/or consumables on key timing
[2:24:03] motorboatingpro: i forget who came up with thaty
[2:24:28] abracka_: ohhh shit, they're adding a quiver and ammo pouch. hunters rejoice

[3:00:58] Molvonos: You just have to prevent 2 casts.  Each Incorporeal's cast time is 8 seconds. Mob only lasts 20 seconds..

[3:01:05] abracka_: revert explosive changes, make it targetable via macro again
[3:01:14] GingerGambit: Afflicted bursting can be bad for healers more things to worry about
[3:01:14] d0nkles: @mavericks312 or they could make non-shit affixes
[3:01:27] mavericks312: did they make explosives cleavable yet?
[3:01:27] Moobot: Tune in Jun 2nd for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[3:01:47] mavericks312: @d0nkles these affixes really arent that bad
[3:01:53] dimofodi: Here's a question we need to answer, will Sanguine heal/damage/do nothing on the Afflicted?
[3:01:58] abracka_: @mavericks312 they changed it so less spawn, but they have more HP
[3:02:24] mavericks312: @abracka_ as a frost mage id love for them to be cleaveable with ice lance
[3:02:27] REDSUNDERGROUND: entangling is going to be  toxic as hell in under rot and freehold
[3:02:27] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:02:31] Molvonos: I dunno if it goes away, but it if the cast on that ability is 8 seconds long, and it lasts only 20 seconds before despawning.  So you could stun it, then interrupt and leave it alone
[3:02:36] dimofodi: They would be "friendly" so would Sanguine hurt them, making them harder to heal, or will it do nothing?
[3:02:42] shrek_is_life1: is there a link to what hes reading?
[3:03:01] abracka_: @mavericks312 it would be nice. i'd even be happy if they just allowed us to make macros to auto target/attack them with spells like ice lance
[3:03:04] Heero_Effect: I‚Äôm excited for new affix‚Äôs in general.
[3:03:08] Wcvechten: what if entangling is like the roots from Cenarius?
[3:03:16] Wugrok: i was hoping they would get rid of explosive
[3:03:17] raldrik: what is entagling mixed with sanguine going to be like
[3:03:20] Valzark: its a slow
[3:03:23] REDSUNDERGROUND: it woould be ok if the radius wasnt 10 yds
[3:03:27] Armdel: atleast with entangling you can stand on top of eachothers
[3:03:54] Harrymason18: @abracka_ I just put a spell like that on mouseover for explosive week
[3:04:08] Molvonos: Entangling is like every world quest we've ever done that's had a tether.  You can blink, leap, hover, etc and break it.
[3:04:13] ark_exitWound: Dk gets hit by entangled, they might move quicker Kappa
[3:04:22] Marts1: Why shouldnt tanks be affected ?
[3:04:27] Valzark: entangle, spiteful monkaS
[3:04:38] Densetsu_: Entangling during the waterwhirls in Halls, sounds fun WutFace
[3:04:46] GingerGambit: Pact
[3:05:01] Marts1: Yeah true, how would you think if spitefull was for tanks?
[3:05:03] dimofodi: Burning Rush....my guild calls it The Doxx...since Doxx would always turn it on and forget to turn it off, taking damage the whole fight. :D :D

[3:05:57] Mecabeast: Isn't ret also getting that freedom talent?
[3:06:07] d0nkles: I wonder if every player will get entagled at the same time
[3:06:18] Maydie6066: so then Druids shapeshift and shamans Spirit Walk should also break it, got some META's forming Kappa
[3:06:26] GingerGambit: Elle said holy doesn‚Äôt get that talent
[3:06:36] neveranyluck: Do shamans still have tremor totems?
[3:06:40] CazualD: Dps should be behind tank where everything is already cleared. So no reason the y should be running into other mobs right ü§∑ Or am I not understanding the entangling?
[3:06:42] Sykum: hunters are fucked
[3:06:55] pigzip: Run Prot Holy Ret all get freedom no worries

[3:07:15] armandostormrage: 20
[3:07:17] Samiccus: Pull raid boss early and disengage isnt that what all hunters do
[3:07:21] Mecabeast: Hunters any sign of danger disengage then feign death
[3:07:23] Wugrok: @neveranyluck yeah but nobody takes it
[3:07:25] Heero_Effect: towOof
[3:07:26] GodKingMuninn: Hunters are fucking your group. Can't wait to see them disengage into a  back.

[3:15:45] Mozzeyy_: i think people just dont like negative affixes, they should be kiss/curse type of deal
[3:16:03] Exilox: yeah it s very simple for those ppl who dont to play this affix just dont do m+
[3:16:07] Arocian: Just put the loot in my bag, don't actually want to play

[3:16:25] gladdyy: everyone is so fixated on kiss curse it's crazy
[3:16:26] Molvonos: The only affixes that were ever kiss/curse were the seasonal ones.
[3:16:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: wait until people see affixes in d4 nightmare dungeons
[3:16:35] dimofodi: The only one that I think should be kiss/curse would have been the seasonal which they did away with. Affixes were always meant to make the dungeon more difficult etc.

[3:17:56] d0nkles: The dungeon mechanics are more fun than the affixes
[3:18:02] Davedaman26: why not have an affixes like having the tarragrue chasing you like in torghast
[3:18:10] Wulfgrym: i think it will end up going to the Magic Johnson group, unless there is a reason the owners dislike the owner there
[3:18:13] dimofodi: If they made it just tyran/fort would it just be tyran and fort at the same time increasing the whole dungeon difficulty or would it be rotating weeks still?
[3:18:14] drewetling: hi panda

[3:30:26] Razekichoo: as a tank main, i learned to enjoy sanguine
[3:30:27] smashwow: anything that makes you go. i really don't want to be here is probably not great design
[3:30:46] PyroShockHD: Entangled and Spiteful are going to be a brutal affix combo on high keys
[3:31:22] smashwow: @PyroShockHD then imagine being in the frog room on those weeks in Halls
[3:31:33] Razekichoo: i rather sanguine than grievious anyday

[3:38:32] smashwow: they'll drop a key once in awhile
[3:38:44] zeiours: Next season hammer squad mdi team let's go @towelliee
[3:38:59] smashwow: hell they might even drop into the lowers
[3:39:07] smashwow: but they'll come back and just 2-0 everything
[3:39:20] smashwow: a warmed up echo is a dangerous echo
[3:39:46] Hizuru1: @smashwow MDI is distaster already because everyone plays these dungeons and knows affixes for 5000Th time to try.
[3:39:55] Hizuru1: @smashwow should be random.
[3:39:58] ClassicMalcontent: You're a
[3:40:05] ClassicMalcontent: 'good egg' @Towelliee
[3:40:08] Baaltaza: The WoW development team for dungeons, bosses and affixes should participate in the MDI. Would be fun. KEKW
[3:40:18] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 do u want the MDI to be 12 hours aday?
[3:40:25] Naturalbeef: Such a mistake for Limit to not compete in MDI
[3:40:27] ark_exitWound: Shak & fired up. Funny aZz duo
[3:40:34] ClassicMalcontent: The old good guy saying heh.
[3:41:01] Hizuru1: @Thoreya what making it unknown,not practice make it 12 hours?
[3:41:09] zeiours: What is the date for the charity event?
[3:41:18] Contendedlemon: this dungeon is gonna be aids lol
[3:41:24] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 yes, no practice would be a non stop wiping fiesta imo
[3:41:44] Hizuru1: @Thoreya past mdi was more fun than just this joke as it is now
[3:41:45] lordmyer: You are good
[3:41:47] smashwow: @Hizuru1 i won't argue the format needs some work to spice it up but putting untested affixes into the mix isn't it. they do some different affix combos once in awhile compared to live (or have in the past).

[3:43:22] Thoreya: ^ lol
[3:43:44] thunderstranger: Song BibleThump
[3:43:49] Norbi33: they cant do it anyway we had so many problems.. and changes over the years..
[3:44:33] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @HolyGuyo (warning)
[3:44:48] smashwow: @Naturalbeef eh. the time investment is just way too much if you're not winning the tourny. probably just made more sense financially to not compete.  think of it like this: you're probably putting in 8 to 12 hr days of practicing to win 5k for 1st place on the non globals. then for globals i think it's 30k for 1st place. sounds like a lot of money until you split that between 5 or 6 people plus the org being out their money.
[3:45:32] falldrgn: @HolyGuyo Check wowhead for it. he does not main a hunter
[3:45:35] tonyr23: Will a heroic raz bow drop from the time walking quest
[3:45:48] falldrgn: it can
[3:46:09] blue_hazee: If I may as what is the most relaxed ranged DPS to play other than hunter
[3:46:12] Hizuru1: @smashwow see if they dont let them practice more will just show up weekend plays not so scripted boring either eveyone wins EZ
[3:46:17] MajurDJ: that, plus i think MDI interferes with raid testing prep, or it has in previous seasons anyways
[3:46:26] HolyGuyo: @falldrgn thanks, do you have any suggestion? Player I mean
[3:46:51] smashwow: @Hizuru1 that's what the Big Push is format wise. MDI is about racing.

[3:47:32] Thoreya: think we'll see a lot more teams do the great push in season 2. more ppl like that format
[3:47:41] Thoreya: max was sayin his players would do the great push
[3:47:47] Samiccus: My asshole still hurts from SOFO
[3:47:47] MajurDJ: for sure, no matter how insane you are at the game, if echo is your competition you need all the prep you can get
[3:47:50] LovingR: do you think winning mdi or rwf will be more achievable as a player ?
[3:48:17] smashwow: they have limited the practice times, last i checked for MDI. i think they only have like 3-ish days of testing + game day testing depending on the bracket breaks.
[3:48:23] Hizuru1: @smashwow Big Push waiting room
[3:48:24] BaronJace: Max said on stream if they had 5 people from the liquid guild he most likely would‚Äôve had a ‚Äúliquid‚Äù team but apparently the members participating in the mdi wanted to bring in people from outside liquid and Max said no.
[3:48:30] evilsoul887: Did you ever report that Druid that grief glitched you?
[3:48:57] Inthezonewow: Pet taunts should automatically not be used when in instanced stuff
[3:48:59] copterskates: both are impossible to achieve at this point
[3:49:13] thunderstranger: @Inthezonewow That's already a thing. Growl is auto-disabled in instance
[3:49:28] smashwow: @Hizuru1 a lot of people like that format better. so they went to a rotating tourny format. now one season is MDI, one season is TGP.

[4:12:29] Molvonos: @pereadin They all only appear during combat.  Entangling, you just move 10 yards.  DPS CC the incorporeal, and the Afflicted gets healed/dispelled.  I don't see how it'll slow down anything

[4:15:55] Molvonos: @Molvonos That would require the Afflicted to stay motionless.  If the mob moves at all, it cant be coded as a totem.  Speculation is that it acts like a spiteful atm

[4:17:30] Molvonos: @pereadin You're an outlier from all the healers I've chatted with, lol.  Grievious was regarded as  the worst affix by far.
[4:17:49] 91Niki: Not if you bring druids only :p
[4:17:50] darkkilla1: bursting afflicted in brackenhide
[4:18:02] smashwow: grievious on most healer specs can suck a fat one
[4:18:04] Molvonos: @darkkilla1 That's a push key.
[4:18:16] 91Niki: Druids laugh at entangled ijpLAUGH
[4:18:20] SpyCrabbo: i feel like the only casters that will have issues with entangle are priests and locks, and even they have stuff to get out
[4:18:26] pereadin: @Molvonos I'm just waiting for all the demon dabbers pulling stuff retreating their entagle into other adds
[4:18:35] pereadin: Entangle just allows more accidental pulls to happen
[4:18:42] Molvonos: @pereadin They do that anyways, not like they need the affix for that excuse, lol
[4:18:44] reggiepowa: free affix for warriors as well, just leap and charge back in
[4:18:46] Nokterian: grievous for mistweaver is no fun either the uptime compared to Resto Druid make mistweaver even harder to play.
[4:18:46] pereadin: It's not the brightest idea of an affix
[4:19:16] Copsonson: SIr doyou have a ui for Wotlk?
[4:19:41] pereadin: I don't trust the pugs I play in with their situational awareness. the keys i did yesterday show that KEKW
[4:19:42] looniebinn: situational awareness is a lot to ask for some Wow players though speedyLaugh
[4:19:47] c0mmander_starscream: "Cheech, Get the yeyo"

[4:20:05] smashwow: i think all of the feedback is based on PUGs. in push groups it's way less of an issue. but the majority of players don't play the game in push groups. they play in PUGs or as PUGs
[4:20:07] pereadin: blizzard puts too much trust in the individual. just make M+ like legion again, its not that hard.  that was the prime of M+
[4:20:17] 91Niki: @pereadin Wait pugs have situational awareness? ijpHMM
[4:20:53] reggiepowa: @pereadin back then m+ loot was worse and you couldnt get tier from it. considering the current rewards m+ should be harder
[4:20:57] Molvonos: Legion M+ was too easy imo
[4:21:06] mmrghost7: new frost dk tier set is sooooo good
[4:21:17] pereadin: instead of developing 3 new affixes they should have just used those resources in developing an actually good seasonal affix
[4:21:48] indiana__cones: 8.3 mythic + will forever be GOATED
[4:21:54] pereadin: Yeah, try pushing top 10 world in Legion and you'd definitely say otherwisee @Molvonos
[4:22:06] Molvonos: Seat was shit without affixes, it's an exception because of bad dungeon

[4:22:37] smashwow: legion the xpac of one shots.
[4:22:54] zinbers: I still think they could add mythic plus on old raid content and dungeon to keep thing up to date
[4:22:58] choco_wow: ya they are just gonna rip aggro and die
[4:22:59] Shrapnel_Sponge: wait for that to asspull in m+ all the time
[4:22:59] tunin02: SeemsGood

[4:23:35] indiana__cones: Ret pally set bonus is good and all, but its just a flat dps increase, nothing fun or different
[4:23:44] GodKingMuninn: arms warrior gonna have to cast slam  now -_-
[4:23:51] zackyton: for any dps players in the party are hunters doing okay now?
[4:23:52] smashwow: idk enhance would disagree
[4:24:14] smashwow: enhance 4p we sunder X targets and negate our 4p
[4:24:19] smashwow: XD
[4:24:22] looniebinn: I don't think blizzard knows what they're doing with it either though

[4:34:43] pereadin: Entangling = movement speed, Incorporeal = haste buff, Dispell one = healing/damage buff
[4:35:15] Jango_: bonus valor for affixes
[4:35:25] NickLeonhearth: All this bitching and whining about kisses, seems to me ppl cant time a +10
[4:35:28] Kyle2k06: sometimes people just like to chill, i think the option for affix would be cool
[4:35:34] pereadin: the kiss would just be the opposite of what the new affixes punish
[4:35:38] abracka_: we don't have valor anymore though in 10.1
[4:36:08] Tamz_tv: i'm challenged =)
[4:36:09] Faregon: yee they havent touched the affix system in years it seems like  and now is a whole shitshow that looks to be too complex to solve.
[4:36:13] decardgame: they are so ez other than time

[4:36:44] LuiBMHunter: if you had a benefit from running with affixes - then everyone would run with affixes anyway - no change ...
[4:36:54] AgentWhiskeyy: just higher dungeons?
[4:37:11] abracka_: enchanters about to be making bank on those crests
[4:37:16] LuiBMHunter: run dungeon to get loot run dungeon to get upgrade thingies
[4:37:48] GamingDad77: except engineering......

[4:39:20] abracka_: SURELY nothing can go wrong with only limited weekend testing

[4:40:37] Sinamun1: is it possible to catch up fast if i buy dragonblight now ?

[4:42:45] GamingDad77: @Sinamun1 you can fairly quickly, but it will be a grind with your first toon.
[4:43:01] HaCKeD_S14: Timegatng feedback opportunities ha
[4:43:15] largefromage: nothing is more cringe than grievous

[4:43:20] smashwow: quaking yes. grievous eh
[4:43:23] Sinamun1: @GamingDad77 thanks
[4:43:24] mon3yb: i take quacking over a root and stun every time

[4:44:11] michaelmm: Isn't the reason we want easier because the harder affixes aren't engaging enough to give a satisfying payoff for the extra difficulty?
[4:44:15] Mister_Ript: That's literally all Volcanic is  lol
[4:44:15] Volkien: Chisel a rock and dodge the rolling

[4:44:32] Scoodles91: or they drop a circle and you get dmg increase if you stay in it
[4:44:35] largefromage: random mobs drop 50k gold you have to pick it up in 5 sec or stun
[4:44:36] reggiepowa: @michaelmm never better loot is satisfying payoff for extra difficulty
[4:44:53] Yurian33: no ... mobs in dungeon give you time warp for 10 seconds ... they continue to cast this on you every 15 seconds
[4:45:06] raldrik: I think the community would rather a diablo approach where the mobs just get stronger on a scale without any affix.
[4:45:12] 91Niki: LUL
[4:45:16] mon3yb: how about giving out something positive when you do the affix? like entangling snares you but if you remove it, you deal some aoe damage
[4:45:29] smesh88: elite packs do yes
[4:45:31] Sayryn: Yes
[4:45:34] Molvonos: On the mobs
[4:45:35] Faregon: they will ye
[4:45:36] GamingDad77: the  bosses do
[4:45:39] Prunusek: Dodge the circle on the ground and you'll get 10% more dps for 10 seconds.
[4:45:54] Molvonos: WoW players couldn't handle the mobs having different affixes.
[4:45:57] smashwow: oh that's actually a decent idea. affix the packs
[4:46:02] Mister_Ript: Thundering gives a buff and people still clear it immediately and want it removed from the game.  Its not about giving a buff for correct play lol...
[4:46:03] Molvonos: They'd whine and bitch like Hello Kitty Island players or some shit
[4:46:06] 91Niki: Rare and elites will have a bigger chance of higher affixes on higher levels, in D4
[4:46:12] Dred_Scythe: Immortal = base difficulty, D3, scaling HP/DMG, D4 = NM Dungeons have Affixes plus scaling HP/DMG
[4:46:18] paulson14: we just wanna pump
[4:46:23] Ocenus: or not even dodge it but everyone soak a circle too

[4:46:26] mon3yb: and the new dispell add, what if you heal it instead of dispelling it burst into aoe heal?
[4:46:35] Orczeus: i like eating but i dont wana chew @Towelliee  lol
[4:46:45] Faregon: @Molvonos wow players can barely handle what we have right now imagien each mob with its own mechanics wow ppl will just implode LUL
[4:46:51] mon3yb: yea but you couldpair the affixes with positive effects
[4:46:56] darkkilla1: pally just gonna LoH it
[4:47:05] Molvonos: They will never have purely positive affixes.
[4:47:16] Atem___: weakauras will see us through lol
[4:47:26] Mister_Ript: Bottom Line -- People are complaining that content, designed to get harder and harder, is hard and want it made easier.  Which is such a backward mentality.
[4:47:29] RageerPLZ: I think infinite scaling, with only kiss affixes would be fun for the general public, eventually they will hit a harder wall but still be happy with all the bigger numbers they get from kiss affixes, even if the affixes have no curse affect they still make you do something to get the benefit you just don't get the benefit if you fail to do it.

[4:48:32] Atem___: I just noticed the new animation on the mammoth mount yesterday its looks interesting lol
[4:48:40] Kyle2k06: i never want to step foot in torghast again
[4:48:58] 91Niki: KEKW
[4:49:02] Jango_: they kind of did torghast/m+ in one of the shadowlands seasons
[4:49:11] Tamz_tv: keep my wifes name out yo mouth
[4:49:11] Molvonos: Worst part is that they removed an affix that didn't have any counterplay aside from 'better gear'.  There was legitimately nothing you could do about it.  These new affixes are all about counterplay and using your skills/knowledge to deal with it.
[4:49:13] LuiBMHunter: I liked Torghast :(
[4:49:18] Molvonos: And people're bitching.
[4:49:19] Mecabeast: Torghast but ab8lities that are mega strong and mob packs that are way denser and aggro to you when you enter the floor
[4:49:44] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee remember Ted running Thorghast on 5 character at the same time...poor guy
[4:49:51] 91Niki: OMEGALUL
[4:49:53] MajurDJ: torghast in m+.... so season 1 shadowlands?
[4:50:00] FunkyRG: Chat, im in EU and i have EU1 and EU2 to chose from the launcher. What is the difference ?
[4:50:04] PrimalRain: Next post, I don't feel the ned to even slash wave. It's a bit much imo
[4:50:07] Effin_Steffin: now thats a banger of an affix right there! sold!
[4:50:07] vic_ave: No because they would have to / wave and thats alot of work
[4:50:12] smesh88: lets not forget a free 3 chest at the end and everyone gets bis gear
[4:50:12] Faregon: @Towelliee why walk all the way to the end just let them enter and leave so they cna get participation trohpies :D
[4:50:14] RoboMaximillion: just send me the loot in the mail every week. just skip the dungeons
[4:50:18] pereadin: I know so many people that would return to the game if they made M+ like Legion again js js
[4:50:22] Molvonos: 'We're returning grievious.  It's on you at the start of dungeon and you cant get rid of it.  Because fuck you.'
[4:50:22] Prunusek: When I've read about Entangling affix from Wowhead's first post I've instantly thought about Brambles mechanic from Cenarius  in the Emerald Nightmare raid.
[4:50:25] theSalute: snoreghast :(

[4:54:50] indiana__cones: VP will be a freebie
[4:54:53] Atem___: boss changes I would assume right?
[4:55:32] Mister_Ript: Not excited to see Vortex Pinnacle.  Very little route customization and those light-prism mobs on the upper side are going to be a pain.

[5:02:01] Kelticlore: It be interesting if stonecore was added to rotation
[5:02:12] pseudo_maso: I can imagine that entangling just works like those roots at Cenarius on Emerald Nightmare - dodgeable vines that fast pace through the floor entangling any players hit but so far I've got no idea lul
[5:02:15] pereadin: It's the passive affixes we love

[5:04:49] Tamz_tv: people will just lie anyway
[5:04:53] pereadin: last boss is the easiest imo
[5:04:59] pereadin: just stand under :)
[5:05:06] Atem___: you think the bosses stay same?  Or get the 1st boss in Jade Serpent treatment?
[5:05:09] falldrgn: can yo jump? and move into a square
[5:05:19] pseudo_maso: For the most part I'd rather had affixes be sufficiently more punishing when not played correctly but have some positive effects when executed well. Having affixes that alter the dungeons dynamic slightly maybe but then again this could come at the cost of repetition and accessibility if you know what I mean
[5:05:25] ArcaneSyntax: I just had a +10 CoS where people still didn't know the snare on the first boss, so it's gonna be fucked
[5:05:33] Snabido: You can negate the root with jumping ye
[5:05:36] KinamKrindar: if the DPS is good enough, like the last time I went in ... never have to deal with the whole "get in the triangle"
[5:05:53] Kelticlore: Id join just to get the laughs on who doesnt do mechanic on last boss
[5:06:02] pereadin: right has a coloration issue
[5:06:08] Hidd3nKnight: it looks like it's bent, yea
[5:06:09] Tamz_tv: yup
[5:06:10] Joeemercy: Hi
[5:06:11] HaCKeD_S14: For sure
[5:06:11] 91Niki: Yeah it does
[5:06:13] pseudo_maso: and cut off affixes like raging & stuff, these don't do nothing but amplify perception of how hard trash hits for 5 secounds and do nothing with an adequate composition
[5:06:18] pereadin: the edge of it
[5:06:19] largefromage: looks like it has been folded in half
[5:06:19] pereadin: its white
[5:06:20] riffraff005: it looks bent from here
[5:06:31] Outerlaw: No it looks bent
[5:06:34] Akermay: looks narrower inh the middle too
[5:06:36] Snabido: Sides look inward
[5:06:46] KinamKrindar: looks bent, you can see mid right looks bent at middle along that same line
[5:06:52] Hidd3nKnight: looking at the top and bottom of the card, it kind of looks like it's raised a little off the table or where ever the picture was taken

[5:43:16] pereadin: + having to dodge mechanics
[5:43:19] Red_Dead_Redeem: 50% movement debuff as well while trying to move 10yards away
[5:43:24] Inthezonewow: I don't wanna play mythic, but can you give me the loot for free? Pepega
[5:43:29] LuiBMHunter: we wouldn't be sitting in front of a pc if we wanted to move far!
[5:43:35] pereadin: imagine entangle with the aoe overlap in Halls of Infusion
[5:43:36] mon3yb: especially as a priest. I mean you got fade with any snares
[5:43:41] Molvonos: Blink.  Hover.  Charge.  Skull Bash. BoF. Rescue. Shadow Step.  Grapple. Heroic Leap. Fel Rush.
[5:43:43] pereadin: recipe for a wipefest
[5:43:45] mon3yb: but depending on how fast it spawns...
[5:43:48] KinamKrindar: "you mean I have to let go of my number keys to stop DPS and use WASD and MOVE ? ... what is this madness? My DPS will suffer!!!!"
[5:43:54] SpyCrabbo: anyone who ever played holy paladin knows how little 10 yards is
[5:43:54] Molvonos: Braincells are not part of the equasion.
[5:43:55] PidiaP: Can‚Äôt you wait till you get Entangled during Harleen‚Äôs bombardment on Tyrannical and you just die :)
[5:44:29] ZeusDNA: @Molvonos Sir, you need to stop making too much sense KEKW
[5:44:30] pereadin: entangle is going to overlap poorly with too many mechanics.  that's the downfall of the affix
[5:44:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: I can imagine that in a high key bracken hallow key being a bit of a problem, but is what it is

[5:44:38] falldrgn: are you going to play thje new season of New world?
[5:45:19] pereadin: Overlap with 3 bosses in Halls of Infusion = wipefest, 1st and last boss in Neltharus, Naraxxus in Neltharions lair, theres too many mechanics where entangle will destroy keys
[5:45:30] kokochris: April 7th for POE I believe ?
[5:45:36] Molvonos: @ZeusDNA It's 10 yards.  Every single class has some way to move and other classes can help other people move.  Even with the 50% snare.  I had someone bitch about DKs getting snared.  Death.  Knights.
[5:45:54] SpyCrabbo: @pereadin barely any class will have to actually walk those 10 yards however
[5:46:15] ZeusDNA: @Molvonos lmao yeah idk, I don't mind it at all. But I'm an Evoker main and mage alt sooo this affix don't bother me
[5:46:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: Incorporeal will be....interesting LUL

[5:46:36] pereadin: @SpyCrabbo you're still putting too much trust on the individual pllayer to move in the proper direction I took that into account when mentioning those bosses
[5:46:42] pereadin: It is I believe T
[5:46:55] Molvonos: Yea, different affixes are gonna be shit for certain classes.  It happened regardless.  Play a caster, had quaking.  Watch your DPS absolutely tank.
[5:47:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: well as a pally if I can freedom the vine then it's fine
[5:47:40] Molvonos: Play a class where you're AoEint a specific place?  Sanguine says hello and screw you.
[5:47:55] Molvonos: I don't see why people're doomsaying so venomously.
[5:47:59] Slitze: what up dudes

[5:48:37] Molvonos: Doubt it'll be dispellable.  BoF will remove snare, but you'll likely still have to break tether.
[5:48:41] ytsidilas: flay procs the st one . sear procx the aoe one

[5:49:04] gold9871: pretty OP aye
[5:49:58] SpyCrabbo: yeah, sadly it's only the single target tentacle that's broken
[5:50:03] Red_Dead_Redeem: having fun playing a game DansGame that's not allowed
[5:50:56] Ziddrax: affix: players get 50% more dmg LUL
[5:50:58] ursinealli: awakened was a good affix
[5:50:59] DudeJoeyAwesome: same. if it ain't hard, people won't complain
[5:51:06] Red_Dead_Redeem: just a different thing we have to deal with, just find a way and do what you gotta do
[5:51:14] pereadin: They should have went forward with removing quaking, and used that development time to create an actually good seasonal affix instead of giving up on the concept
[5:51:50] NickLeonhearth: I would put a random boss from the dungeon spawning as a trash mob with all of his mechanics Kappa
[5:51:51] ZeusDNA: I'm just happy they're willing to change things up and try new things. I like change and new stuff
[5:51:51] falldrgn: full BIS. after one boss.. but you are a feral druid
[5:52:16] ZeusDNA: Sometime they will hit. Sometimes they will miss
[5:52:35] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah overall I'm happy with the direction they are taking
[5:53:18] Atem___: I'm over thundering
[5:53:23] Atem___: people still cant do it

[5:55:01] Red_Dead_Redeem: nice hoodie @Towelliee

[5:57:31] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah I would not know tbh
[5:57:31] abracka_: necrotic luxthoKEKSh luxthoKEKSh
[5:57:34] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee summon a random boss from the dungeon as a trash mob with all his abilities
[5:57:36] Ziddrax: jumping spawns a mob LUL
[5:57:37] ZeusDNA: I would say, I don't know.
[5:57:37] SpyCrabbo: get teleported to a different random dungeon at the start
[5:57:40] tuner86: I started playing this at wotlk, now last friday I finally took the time and watch some healing vids on yt to see how to priest and I did a +5 mythic last night even, proud of myself :)
[5:57:42] Gengisman: pile of puppies
[5:57:45] kellevaran: dont press jump while doing dps or you will fall over
[5:57:46] mon3yb: why does it need do be punishing?
[5:57:52] MrGrimms: Morning Towelliee, ready for more rain for us today and this week >_<
[5:57:57] PotbellyGoat: lol
[5:57:57] Moobot: Tune in Jun 2nd for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[5:57:58] ursinealli: Why does it have to be a curse? What is the point of affixes in general? Is it just to slow down how fast you can do a dungeon? Or is it to slightly change how you do the dungeon?
[5:58:01] ryp0: got a crieftorch from timewalking chest finaly
[5:58:06] PotbellyGoat: How are we still explaining this
[5:58:12] ursinealli: Slowing you down doesn't really change how you do a dungeon.
[5:58:19] Alienfromger: het rid of it and make duingeons harder?
[5:58:20] Atem___: hey they could brought back teeming lol be thankful
[5:58:21] Contendedlemon: but encrpyted wasnt punishing Sadge only if your dps bursted Wo lol

[5:58:30] Molvonos: I feel the people asking why affixes have to be bad don't understand what the purpose of M+ is.
[5:58:32] Snabido: Thats not how wow players work nowadays Keepo
[5:58:34] ZeusDNA: Feels like the people who ask this weren't playing before M+ was a thing
[5:58:35] abracka_: thinking? no sir
[5:58:35] vic_ave: My mom said NO
[5:58:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: having to press more then 3 buttons WutFace
[5:58:53] neveranyluck: Take 1% hp in dmg per second. 5% in main stat and 2nd highest. Only way to dispel is to give to someone else. And it can stack
[5:58:57] zhc_: yeah bring back teeming and make spiteful teeming proc more spitefuls
[5:59:09] Molvonos: Dudes up in here wanting a gentle pat on the back and being told they're a good boy/girl as an affix.
[5:59:13] Molvonos: Jesus.
[5:59:13] Garagance: @Towelliee affix that gives u buff if u press always diff spell and if u repeat same reset of buff for dmg that previous roation gave u
[5:59:17] BlueBlurPrime: lol
[5:59:19] xFastidiousx: Why do that to yourself
[5:59:23] CazualD: Id like to see something like, if you miss an interrupt on AOE cast spell does additional 20% damage
[5:59:23] Contendedlemon: sign him up for blizzard
[5:59:26] botscast: found the blizz employee
[5:59:30] thedamndudedevin: Blind for 3 seconds - screen black. If you don't find a kill the spawned rogue quick enough lolol

[5:59:42] falldrgn: Ion in the chat
[5:59:42] dermatoid: even blizzard will ask what's wrong with him
[5:59:44] eldritchcoffee: ok: a mini hulk hogan appears and you must kill him in 30 seconds or else he wrestles your whole party to death. But, if you kill him in that 30 seconds he gives you a huge aoe buff where your character gets a new button that lets them say "brother" and when you use it, it insta kills mobs then the button expires.
[5:59:45] Ordicos: the seasonal with the portals in BfA :P
[5:59:46] Atem___: dungeon hot potato
[5:59:52] George2001k: @towelliee a permanent decrease in stats when you personally die for the rest of the run.

[6:00:01] x614x_engineer: LOL
[6:00:01] Molvonos: HMMSH

[6:00:07] Baaltaza: 4 Buttons, huh? *nervous.Brewmaster.noises*
[6:00:08] Snabido: That implies interrupt are being cast Kappa
[6:00:13] RaginCajun05: i think the problem with a negative giving a positive is people always fidn a way to exploit the positive
[6:00:18] reggiepowa: pala is op for kicks though
[6:00:18] Xerevil: man really likes pain
[6:00:21] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: What if a mechanic requires you to stack, and you get vines and have to move? Is that fun gameplay? @Towelliee
[6:00:22] Dratomae: Something like bursting but only slowing you for 10% per stack
[6:00:22] MrGrimms: I want the affix that spawns the little g'huunies from dead mobs again :D
[6:00:27] ZeusDNA: towNut1
[6:00:29] kokochris: KEKW
[6:00:29] Red_Dead_Redeem: oh lawd
[6:00:30] Contendedlemon: with a gas mask attached to your own butt
[6:00:33] kata_gamez: would a pally avengers shield be a missed interupt?
[6:00:35] Vercross92: bring teeming back, but redesigned so the teeming mobs in the dungeon apply necrotic as well
[6:00:38] Firedexx: no kink shaming
[6:00:39] DudeJoeyAwesome: is big mommy Bobby Kotick?
[6:00:39] NickLeonhearth: how big's the mommy?
[6:00:48] Molvonos: Here's my idea.
[6:00:51] Dratomae: Exactly
[6:00:55] FyreK1ll3r: Murlocs randomly sapping you throughout the dungeon
[6:00:55] zhc_: my poor dk
[6:00:57] zodd_amhai: NO wtf
[6:01:00] Pallyofhell: that sounds awful LUL
[6:01:01] Atombomb1987: How bout your character cant move forward only backwards. A curse will be applied that spreads based on prox and stacks for the life of the dungeon @Towelliee
[6:01:05] Dratomae: Removable with magic dispels and slow removals
[6:01:06] Broomba: everyone is an expert at tuning games at home, but are not professional game developers KEKW
[6:01:15] phocho: lmao
[6:01:21] dermatoid: what about a buff/damage combo that stacks
[6:01:25] Molvonos: Volcanic, except instead of something that knocks you up, it's a lava puddle that has a magnetic effect that pulls the players into it.   Like the Djaradin mobs do.

[6:01:28] CazualD: I haven‚Äôt complained about any. I think they‚Äôre good to teach people shit. And interrupts are something people need to learn
[6:01:28] Molvonos: There you go.
[6:01:33] Cereaz: in combat everytime you move in combat you take 1% dmg
[6:01:40] sharpeforever: wont matter death blast doesnt need 20% buff
[6:01:40] ZeusDNA: Wasn't someone complaining about affixes slowing the dungeon down and then someone suggests an affix that literally slows you down KEKW
[6:01:45] Molvonos: Go ahead, read mine @Towelliee
[6:01:46] SpyCrabbo: how about certain bosses can turn into a certain random different boss at the start of combat
[6:01:47] Folgrum: good pala affixes next season, just cleanse gg
[6:01:51] zodd_amhai: chat is the real WoW killer KEKW
[6:01:52] MrGrimms: @Molvonos You stop it right now!!! lol no
[6:01:53] Atem___: if you kill more than x amount of mobs in a pull you summon an empowered mob
[6:01:54] ytsidilas: @Towelliee every x secconds mobs gain x% dmg reduction from a cardinal direction
[6:01:54] falldrgn: spells have a chance to missfire and deal partial damage to you
[6:01:55] mon3yb: but why can't it have both? Entangling - Snares you and you can choose to ignore it (well you are snared..) but if you do break it you get some kind of bonus. Lets say a mob sprouts the entaglement. Now it takes damage for every vine broken
[6:02:00] Xorag_: Miss an interrupt then you poop your pants irl
[6:02:12] vic_ave: lmao
[6:02:15] MeisterPetze: SHARKNADO
[6:02:15] Snabido: That shit is more obnoxious
[6:02:16] thedamndudedevin: This sounds like M++
[6:02:18] Squid1030: sinkhole -  your character insta dies
[6:02:21] KingSlayerYotam: After 5 enemies killed get 5% random stat
[6:02:21] Contendedlemon: spawn tornados whenever a mob dies
[6:02:23] free2act: every 5 successfull interupts, group gets buffed -  30% increased dmg
[6:02:33] Broomba: @towelliee -- blizzard is going to lol KEKW and tweet out these suggestions
[6:02:36] abracka_: mom can you pick me up, chat is suggesting horrific affixes for S2
[6:02:37] jamesc398: one person occasionally becomes hostile and has temporary pvp moment
[6:02:49] phocho: if you drop below 10% health you automatically get disconnected from the game
[6:02:54] mon3yb: well ranges have to interrupt their spells, melees have to move out
[6:02:56] thedamndudedevin: LUL a good job pat for doing your job lol
[6:02:57] Molvonos: Ya'll wanted easy, fuck that, i'm gonna make it harder.  New Affix: Walling - You want narrow corridors with your narrow corridors?  They have the tech for it, Frost Mages in PvP can create walls.  Now the mobs can too.
[6:02:58] Senthius09: an add spawns that if not killed summons bobby kotick to your house to kick you in the nuts
[6:02:58] zodd_amhai: @abracka_ same pick me up too KEKW
[6:03:04] George2001k: @towelliee no affixes at all, just a flat big increase in all damage and HP of all trash and bosses.
[6:03:12] Eizenhart: Something something makes you look bad on the damage meter :)
[6:03:13] gindarie: gindarie subscribed with Prime. 
[6:03:17] StarPriestessShika: whenever you kill a mob you are silenced and disarmed for 2 seconds
[6:03:20] Fibus: affixes get affixes!
[6:03:21] ijuki: Bolstering add = You become a boldozer Kappa
[6:03:21] Exodeo_: I'm retiring from m+ if any of these make it to Wow xD
[6:03:22] MeisterPetze: -1 raider io score for every min of a dungeon
[6:03:22] Atem___: April fools day Blizzard post is going to be spicy for Blizzard this year thanks to this community
[6:03:25] sharpeforever: how about if you interrupt nothing, you get silenced for 2 secs. This will create a fear of interrupts
[6:03:27] ursinealli: That would be fine if there was only one affix
[6:03:31] Red_Dead_Redeem: HELP I'm scared, chat is suggesting afixes WutFace
[6:03:40] Red_Dead_Redeem: *affixes
[6:03:43] 2naDlisch: Kiss could be as simple is leech for grievious, avoidance for bursting, etc
[6:03:47] mon3yb: explosives, they go off = boom, they don't go off every 33% life it ticks an aoe fire nova
[6:03:47] DanielMorenoMiniatures: no we want no affixes and make dungeons more challenging
[6:03:47] Molvonos: A Random Mind Control affix would be wonderful.  And it can hit Tanks/Healers too.
[6:03:50] Alaquane: I don't see the problem
[6:03:59] Contendedlemon: every 20 seconds youre mind controlled you can damage your teammates but you have dps increase
[6:04:06] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @free2act (warning)
[6:04:09] KingSlayerYotam: why is that bad, lets try the diablo 3 shit in m+
[6:04:10] jerseyfive: i want legendary for logging in HYPERS
[6:04:10] Alienfromger: what about randomly rotating affixes after a while in a dungeon

[6:04:27] MrGrimms: @Molvonos That could actually work pretty good
[6:04:31] Vercross92: Tendrils from below - void tendrils will shoot up after 2 sec from a purple swirl on the ground, then explode in a 10yd radius
[6:04:31] Atem___: then everyone will blow their interrupt on the first cast lol, see it now
[6:04:32] thedamndudedevin: Rogue add spawns that if you don't kill your screen goes black for 2 seconds due to smoke cloud lol

[6:04:33] fewixtwo2: a random mob is shielded, if u cannot break the shield and interrupt, your party is feared for 10 sec
[6:04:34] kata_gamez: why punish interrupting when people already don't interrupt?
[6:04:36] Cereaz: every 10 secs in combat, you poop your pants and create a toxic pool on the floor that dmgs you.
[6:04:42] abracka_: i hope they throw in "adding a tank spec to evokers" for you on april 1st
[6:04:42] Dratomae: Each enemy revives after a second with how much health it had 5 seconds before it's death
[6:04:50] SpyCrabbo: some mobs can turn into random mobs from different dungeons @Towelliee
[6:04:51] mon3yb: bursting and bolstering are fine as they are. You have to play around but it does not punish you directly
[6:04:57] SpyCrabbo: i just like randomness tbh
[6:05:04] thedamndudedevin: @Cereaz "Mom! Bathroom!"
[6:05:10] mon3yb: it changes your playstile but does not impact your rotation or movement
[6:05:13] Baaltaza: KEKW
[6:05:13] firehawk73: Kids.... cmonBruh
[6:05:19] jamesc398: one person occasionally becomes hostile and you have a small pvp moment with the others
[6:05:19] Alienfromger: yeah make it more random
[6:05:21] Baaltaza: Oh god
[6:05:24] FerociouzMonk: every mob is now deathwing. wipe and all you get is a shiny rock as reward at end of dungeon.
[6:05:31] Sacurra: Randomly swap location of two people in the dungeon.
[6:05:32] Teriyakibro: KEKW the healer
[6:05:34] Atem___: Patchwerk randomly spawns lol
[6:05:36] vic_ave: affix that turns one party member into a treasure goblin and if you kill them before they go thru the portal you get a group 5% haste buff
[6:05:36] daGawdT: or the dark void mob lol
[6:05:40] sharpeforever: what if they PI the boss while MCed
[6:05:44] mon3yb: you leave trails of lava behind you
[6:05:45] jerseyfive: random dps heal the mob
[6:05:53] ytsidilas: mobs get dmg reduction from a cardinal direction
[6:05:53] Valerric: After an interrupt is missed, Spawn a mob that has to be healed to full before a skill cast is completed. If not healed in time everyone gets silenced for 10 seconds.

[6:22:13] ShadowDMG6969: YO WHOLE DUNGEON PULLS
[6:22:14] Mister_Ript: How the hell are you supposed to "plan routes more carefully" if you're teleported to random locations  lmao
[6:22:16] ZeusDNA: "Adapt quickly" Followed by "plan routes carefully"
[6:22:16] JoeFoo: LUL
[6:22:16] Buckwink: thats the mechanic
[6:22:21] GamingDad77: no...re read it
[6:22:22] dermatoid: what if when you were teleported wherver the last pack lost aggro
[6:22:23] 2naDlisch: No, the mobs are teleported too
[6:22:26] medanmarko: No, because it says players AND enemies get teleported.
[6:22:27] kowaikokoro: GIGACHAD speedrunning you said?
[6:22:27] Daarksyde: it says you and the enemies
[6:22:32] NetherRegion: towNotwo towOof
[6:22:34] Xerevil: That person is not sane LUL
[6:22:34] drunkpool2: Succeeding - You have a 1% chance on any mythic plus dungeon to have your char copied on Moonguard and spawned in Goldshire

[6:23:27] Densetsu_: Then u kill em all!
[6:23:27] thedamndudedevin: Itsa kiss
[6:23:28] Roaringkittylol: Riftweaver's Challenge: This affix would add powerful magical rifts to each dungeon that players must navigate through. Each rift would have its own set of challenges and enemies, and players must use their wits and skills to overcome them.
[6:23:33] Zansteh: KEKW
[6:23:35] NetherRegion: I like the random mirror images
[6:23:35] Alaquane: that's just a pure buff

[6:24:19] SK1NFATHER: These sound cool tho
[6:24:33] zhc_: good one too
[6:24:38] sharpeforever: what... thats easier for healing
[6:24:38] Zansteh: 20% of a bear tank is all my mage health
[6:24:43] Samiccus: OMG as a blood DK I will kill the whole party because ill just take massive dam and heal lol

[6:25:39] GamingDad77: @L1as AI generated
[6:25:53] Alaquane: don't stack on the tank
[6:26:00] Baaltaza: HOly shit
[6:26:02] drunkpool2: What about all dungeons have a random chance to spawn Raz the Crazed from Blackrock Caverns that beats the dungeon for you
[6:26:09] Onearmyof2: just back to kiting every pull lol
[6:26:12] fewyn: that's kind of like reverse bolstering?

[6:26:37] Onearmyof2: the new affixes are really not that bad
[6:26:42] GamingDad77: @Baaltaza yes
[6:26:51] Reckless_Monk: thats what i said.. anything they create and impliment.. the community will hate it
[6:27:10] leon1071: not that bad until stacked with 5 other dungeon mechanics
[6:27:13] x614x_engineer: that was funny
[6:27:13] Reckless_Monk: unless they add a beneficial buff to the affix
[6:27:41] Onearmyof2: Imagine an infinite dragon seasonal affix, feel like blizz is missing out on that
[6:27:50] drunkpool2: TBH the only dungeon I hate is spiteful and thats because it does it on every mob and solos the healer
[6:28:01] ktthemage: The best thing they could do would be space the dungeons in such a way, that if you're doing so well in a key, it can scale in real time. And you're given an option to scale it or not as you move through.
[6:28:46] xmedpakx: hehe entanglement with spiteful will be fun
[6:28:51] Onearmyof2: almost every class has a way of getting out of entangling almost instantly
[6:28:58] leon1071: it sucks how they got rid of easy affixes like volcanic

[6:29:37] Alaquane: Mr T nightelf mohawk affix. He shows up and hits a player with a grenade. They become a Mohawk, all player abilities are replaced with Mohawk abilities.

[6:33:59] nothrad: now I asked ChatGPT to please create 4 creative and new affixes, all with a kiss/curse-component, for handling it well or bad, respectively. they are all pretty nice.
[6:34:28] Buckwink: I liked reaping
[6:34:28] BlueBlurPrime: how about a mutation affix? one mob has the mutation buff, if he gets his mutate cast off the adds get 10% damage and health but if interrupted it stuns all the mobs for 2s in an aoe?

[6:35:29] SpyCrabbo: playing an outlaw during reaping was something else
[6:35:33] Mister_Ript: Affix:  "A powerful add spawns that regenerates 5% of its max health every second and fixates on the tank.  While alive, it gives the group X% damage/healing bonus, but if it reaches the tank... the tank dies instantly.  The add can be CC'd and damage does not break CC, but all CC suffers from 30% DR at all times."

[6:36:05] Sykum: what that tank doing?
[6:36:22] JansonLives: Yeah I just got to heal a tank doing this w/o putting him through the fire until he just stood him in the fire. It was...a thing
[6:36:44] Sykum: how hard is it to put him in the fire?
[6:36:55] zhc_: i think they can remove affixes if they add all those random affixes and shit as a mechanic in the dungeon itself just keep tyran/fort as 1 affix
[6:38:44] dermatoid: base tyranical but you can mod a key for extra % drop chances?

[6:40:14] zhc_: yeah cause theres always a ceiling the one key u cant get past cause its just one shots
[6:40:19] Caloz7: or just seasonal
[6:40:30] Mister_Ript: Affixes are honestly the entire point of M+.  Increased difficulty.  If people don't like affixes, don't do M+
[6:40:41] GodKingMuninn: 2 seasonal affixes.

[6:41:03] Pallyofhell: how they did M+ in legion was just fine
[6:41:08] Theliahh: Affixes that increase difficulty are fine, but some affixes are frustrating/annoying to play and genuinely make the game worse
[6:41:19] Buckwink: explosive is antifun
[6:41:22] haugexxx: how's dragonflight currently?
[6:41:31] Valerric: except in the current gear progression, you pretty much have to do m+ to get the gear to do heroic raid
[6:41:32] JansonLives: I'll take sanguine over spiteful any day of the week.
[6:41:38] daxirr1: Explosive makes me not want to do m+ during that week
[6:41:49] ArcaneSyntax: sanguine suuuuucccckkkkssss
[6:41:49] Theliahh: @daxirr1 100%
[6:41:58] Theliahh: explosive in its current state is least fun affix
[6:42:12] GodKingMuninn: Not all affixes are equal burden on everyone. As a DPS I give no shits about grievous, sanguine, explosives, skittish. As a melee Idgaf about quaking as much as I do as a melee.
[6:42:26] abracka_: entanglement on the last boss in vortex pinnacle
[6:42:28] JansonLives: as dps explosive is almost a non-affix to me LUL
[6:42:35] Rudric_Ice: U need to make m+ fun not just HARD
[6:42:37] zhc_: like why was necrotic on BRH with all those bats a thing

[6:44:37] The_Dane_Train: I don‚Äôt want a loot pi√±ata.
[6:44:42] mon3yb: to be fair, if the affix is not difficult to play around because of overlaps or UI issues (explosives) i guess they are fine
[6:44:43] thedamndudedevin: I wouldnt lol
[6:44:47] AKBigscarybear: ya but they always seem to be the ones that get listened to

[6:45:54] Tac2cul: ya id rather keep explosive the way it is if they are4 keeping it
[6:46:04] LUKA_THIM: explosives never bothered me as dh player and now im playing evoker still not bothering
[6:46:21] ArcaneSyntax: Growl had a reasonable take on this i felt

[6:51:17] BootySavesLives: ehhhh I have pugged to 2400 thundering I think is engaging and fun
[6:51:22] defunked: I wish with explosive when I bladestorm it would kill the explosive if I target it but it doesn't
[6:51:31] zeiours: Why didn't they fix it with the feedback?
[6:51:35] mavericks312: Imagine FF14 has content lmao
[6:51:40] Reckless_Monk: WF raiders wanted Master Loot.. / Group Loot.. they got it.. now they cry

[6:51:53] Kelticlore: Maybe not all but for Certain people ff14 is for
[6:52:05] mon3yb: like who is "viable" in m+ is pretty much dictated by the MDI
[6:52:22] Mecabeast: I hope we get an elevator boss this expansion
[6:52:28] abracka_: it took them a hot minute to finish that
[6:52:30] Theliahh: they didn't
[6:52:34] Reckless_Monk: nope
[6:52:34] Gungre: Because TOP is the most difficult ultimate that's been put into FF so far

[6:53:09] ItsXolten: Maybe a hot take Looking at most of the new affixes and the new info that came out, their all free imo. Afflicted just needs to be healed weather or not its by healer or off heals. Entangling literally move 2 ft or use a movement ability and Incorporeal just interrupt LUL
[6:53:26] mon3yb: 800-1000 pulls is average

[6:54:03] mavericks312: That pull count would be lowered if they could use addons
[6:54:11] breadwilton: I just hope they dont start tuning the first few weeks around Race to World First
[6:54:24] breadwilton: Because they cant afford to keep so many ppl at a venue
[6:54:25] Kelticlore: Wasnt SOO close to 19
[6:55:03] mavericks312: The new affixes are easy and simple ppl are bitching just to bitch
[6:55:04] DudeTheory: Has Blizzard experimented with any procedural generated content in WoW as of yet?
[6:55:04] Pallyofhell: hell rets can deal with the healing add with 1 WoG
[6:55:18] ItsXolten: DK can probably just pre death advanced would be my guess
[6:55:52] mavericks312: When does s1 end I still need 190 pts for ksm
[6:55:56] Inthezonewow: Yea Torg
[6:56:05] Mister_Ript: The new Vaults are procedurally generated, I believe.

[6:57:38] GodKingMuninn: As soon as they made torghast non mandatory I began to play it a lot
[6:57:38] Mister_Ript: Mr. Towel -- thoughts on this affix idea?  A powerful add spawns that regenerates 5% of its max health every second and fixates on the tank.  While alive, it gives the group X% damage/healing bonus, but if it reaches the tank... the tank dies instantly.  The add can be CC'd and damage does not break CC, but all CC suffers from 30% DR at all times.
[6:57:42] GodKingMuninn: doesn't scale
[6:57:44] DudeJoeyAwesome: bust that shit open
