[1:59:59] 107GOATY: do you ever worry about vaping near the computer?
[2:00:08] Broomba: its ok if you are and we cant see it.
[2:00:10] Sollice: The wires and shit professional streamers with all those room lights have to deal with is disgusting
[2:00:25] Vivelli: what classes does towel have lvld/is lvling for classic? warr/druid/ and pally when bc hits?
[2:00:26] dreioo: @Broomba ah it's nice we can all coexist :)
[2:00:44] Sollice: @Vivelli Yep I believe thats the three he will have ready
[2:00:50] KinggKebab: Where's the leak?
[2:00:57] Vivelli: word
[2:00:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: someone call tipsout Kappa
[2:00:58] Eastwicksavag3: lmao
[2:01:01] Broomba: its just tiring for people to come in and second guess towelliees decision on his new room on what he should have done and didnt do
[2:01:04] dreioo: o  f  f  i  c  i  a  l
[2:01:19] mrmanno14: You think it’s really June 1st tho?
[2:01:20] dacooldewd: @Towelliee hey mate, what is Rested Experience?
[2:01:29] Eastwicksavag3: leal rerecomfirmed
[2:01:39] 3krowns: wouldnt that be a bit rushed for tbc to be released?

[2:02:09] DudeInARobe: If TBC is June 1st, and retail is nowhere near being done/tested on. I could see retail come out a month later at July 1st

[2:02:16] dacooldewd: @Towelliee thank you for the info
[2:02:39] WowItsFrostyLOL: How would you feel about it coming out June 1st? Asmongold had some pretty good points about it being way too soon. What are your thoughts?
[2:03:01] dreioo: @Broomba oh I see I guess my joke was a bit insensitive. Imagine being told how your living box should be, by strangers no less.
[2:03:05] Motivess: 200% xp from killing mobs only
[2:03:24] 3krowns: its been quite silent from their side  for a while now :p
[2:03:25] Broomba: not you, but others who constantly complained and criticized him for weeks
[2:03:41] DelcoAF: Nothing like wfh and doing trainings aka watching towel on twitch
[2:03:43] dreioo: @Broomba lmao sheesh
[2:04:16] briefbreadfruit: I was hoping for prepatch on the 12th, since I have some vacation time during that week. Guess that's off the table
[2:04:27] Artivicii: gruul
[2:04:27] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:04:29] PokerFaceMoose: gruul
[2:04:44] dreioo: motherfuckin Gruul...
[2:04:48] WowItsFrostyLOL: I don’t remember all of their points but I think part of it was giving people time to level the op classes for world firsts and shit. I THINK.
[2:04:55] Heos90: have they tested prepatch?
[2:05:07] MrRibzz: Hey, @Towelliee are you excited for the Mythic+ Charity Pro-Am next weekend?
[2:05:10] Broomba: if blizz opened up everything on day 1 then people will burn through that and then complain that there is no content
[2:05:33] Kinghorn: I am ready for TBC today
[2:05:36] Kinghorn: lets goooo
[2:05:46] da_moosse: @Towelliee the room is looking good
[2:05:46] FatalFlener: Is 2h fury good/fun for leveling?
[2:05:47] dreioo: did they actually force june 1st because of Ashes of Creation?
[2:06:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: well i get a bonus day off because Monday is Memorial Day
[2:06:04] briefbreadfruit: I just want to get the fuck away from vanilla and never return, I'm fine with june 1st
[2:06:06] dreioo: or is that just silly conspiracy?
[2:06:09] AirmVn: june first what ? prepatch or TBC release ?
[2:06:20] FunkNjunk: What is happening June 1
[2:06:26] 3krowns: who knows, they might release prepatch next week to make it more suitable for a June 1st release
[2:06:32] DudeInARobe: @airmanltk TBC prepatch
[2:06:32] dreioo: @FunkNjunk a possible release day for BC
[2:06:41] FunkNjunk: ahh
[2:06:42] Heos90: its a book in town
[2:06:43] WowItsFrostyLOL: Oh ok I think I misunderstood why people thought it was bad. I thought they thought it would be bad.
[2:06:45] Heos90: in the inn
[2:06:48] dreioo: @FunkNjunk release for prepatch sorry
[2:06:51] PokerFaceMoose: dont have to kill him
[2:06:52] DudeInARobe: Release would be June First, pre-patch 2 weeks before
[2:06:52] Heos90: i just did that quest last night
[2:06:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a loot a book quest
[2:06:54] PokerFaceMoose: sneak by him
[2:06:57] Wildside1177: You do not have to kill him
[2:06:58] dayzzeven: It's a loot book quest
[2:06:59] TMMOOF: I bet June 1 is pre patch, maybe?
[2:07:08] mackieeswe: mackieeswe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 95 months, currently on a 88 month streak! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:07:10] AirmVn: @DudeInARobe so how long is prepatch going to be then ?
[2:07:10] egraves7: very carefully
[2:07:12] PokerFaceMoose: i did it on a 1900lb tauren so you def can
[2:07:12] dreioo: @FunkNjunk it's all in the air for now lol
[2:07:16] sandduz1: its still shit wuest
[2:07:21] simonbgg: So, how sure are we they will give us any info today? :) @Towelliee
[2:07:25] azurrei: I happen to be off the week after June 1st,a time I choose 6 months ago lol - would be extreme luck but I'd be happy with just playing prepatch while im off
[2:07:25] FunkNjunk: more interested in 9.1
[2:07:40] DudeInARobe: @airmanltk May 18th would be pre-patch. June 1st release for TBC. So 2 weeks of pre-patch
[2:07:52] dreioo: @azurrei I'm rooting for ya
[2:08:10] mavericks312: unless they release 9.1 without the raid and add the raid a week or 2 later
[2:08:19] AirmVn: ffs I really hope they don't overlap tbc launch with 9.1l like they did naxx with shadowlands
[2:08:41] heatheraustin: I have been out of the loop, what is Happening June 1st?
[2:08:43] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee sounds like your;re really unhappy with the state of WOW. i always log on and you complain about it
[2:08:43] Moobot: Be on Discord. I will announce the giveaways as I play some Classic. Be active and be IN Twitch chat at time of winning.
[2:08:48] shimwood: That's a lot
[2:08:50] geezohmy: Mom
[2:08:51] WowItsFrostyLOL: This isn’t me talking shit about blizzard, I’m just genuinely curious what internal problems they’re having getting it out in a reasonable time.
[2:08:56] paintman550: just tuned in, info on 9.1 or on tbc?
[2:09:04] DudeInARobe: 9.1 is so far behind. They have SOOOOO much balancing to do... the list is very large when it comes to player power stuff
[2:09:34] mavericks312: @dudeinarobe when has wow been balanced
[2:09:39] DudeInARobe: @heatheraustin Speculated TBC release
[2:09:45] FranciscoTheMage: i get it. im exhausted too.
[2:09:48] dreioo: does the prepatch include the 2 new races? I'd love to start my Draenei Priest (male btw so cool off your pants)
[2:10:01] TheNextKing306: even as a casual player I'm struggling to find things to do
[2:10:04] DudeInARobe: @mavericks312 I agree with ya there. For sure. It’s just a mess right now
[2:10:10] simonbgg: @dreioo Yes it does =)
[2:10:12] shimwood: Like Petty said, the waiting is teh hardest part
[2:10:20] NeihanaNZ: any other time I'd be bitching as well but we still on mythic daddy D :( fbm
[2:10:24] dreioo: @Simonbhehe YES it's gonna be a good time! Thanks!
[2:10:32] simonbgg: Idd man!
[2:10:37] DudeInARobe: Leveling alts in SL is also so fuckin painful.
[2:10:38] luckfore: shadowlands will go down as a wod 2.0 sadly
[2:10:38] drmabusee: theres still a pandemic going on dont forget that
[2:10:39] hookkz: i think SL was very fun at the start but the content draught again... not good
[2:10:42] zuvic: Blizz got me with their 6 month sub mount bonus. It's a trap every time
[2:10:46] FranciscoTheMage: i still cant believe they didnt plan at least a mini raid or something
[2:10:46] DudeInARobe: Only thing to do right now too, leveling alts
[2:10:54] zuvic: Every time they offer 6 month sub mount it means content draught trap
[2:10:56] TheNextKing306: on the plus side I'm getting pretty good at prideful
[2:11:03] Artivicii: where did u get that polearm
[2:11:06] dreioo: the first month of SL was great, I find
[2:11:25] Vivelli: idk maybe im a bit different, i just go play something else. its not like someone is forcing you to play the game. unless your livelyhood depends on it or something
[2:11:25] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:11:27] ahla03: why ZG boost today ?
[2:11:57] dracullus: @Towelliee Uldir had 8, SoD 9, mini raid 2, now we have 10/10, number of bosses is same
[2:12:03] Aravarth: @Towelliee Bruh, that shelving behind you looks dope AF.
[2:12:11] WowItsFrostyLOL: I wonder if it would be better for them to have smaller content updates for a faster patch cycle, and then major patches are just a little smaller.
[2:12:11] simonbgg: I wonder what change they have to make to not keep falling behind once again. Happen alot of times now it feels like. And we had more raids & content at release before in like MoP etc @Towelliee
[2:12:28] ohnot___her: What server is the hammer squad on
[2:12:28] firefly_on: the thing is tier sets for 1 patch or for the next expac aswell
[2:12:35] dreioo: ION thorHammer
[2:12:39] HyoonKang: didnt he said there will be something mindblowing about 9.2?
[2:12:41] DudeInARobe: I’m not excited for tier sets if they have the terrible loot drop raids right now mtpCRY
[2:12:45] Heos90: so the books whose pages fade from black to white is the right one
[2:12:46] mrmanno14: 9.2: More Visions of N’Zoth
[2:13:02] briefbreadfruit: a small amount yes
[2:13:03] moshcraft: yes
[2:13:07] jeneraljelly: very small amount
[2:13:12] derElten: yes but very very little
[2:13:19] dreioo: nice
[2:13:23] derElten: tight

[2:13:36] rsimpson105: Yoooooo we’re back in the room hell yeah
[2:13:37] sinlesssinner: i am just disappointed they told us years ago that they start working on an expac 3 years prior, ie while the current one is underway. With how BFA and SL has been, i dont think they really do that :) @Towelliee
[2:13:38] briefbreadfruit: 10 hp per hit per rank I believe

[2:13:39] Twentiee: 9.2 in 2023 kek
[2:13:48] bob_the_demon: right now realistically 9.2 would come out March/April of next year. Going at their current pace
[2:13:59] PadidinJones: Ion was making promises for huge stuff for 9.2

[2:14:02] LawnRaptor: good morning hammer squad!
[2:14:05] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee in that preach interview it seemed the ion was saying 9.3 is well progressed
[2:14:08] SirNoelOfAzeroth: 9.2 Release date on current trend Dec 2022
[2:14:17] Aravarth: "Cut it short", you mean like how they cut the number of raid tiers in WoD?
[2:14:21] FranciscoTheMage: 9.2 i mean
[2:14:31] Shrandamar: the .5 patches will be sacrificed I bet
[2:14:32] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:14:35] luckfore: 3 year a bad expac
[2:14:36] AirmVn: they can do 3 year expansion because of tbc\
[2:14:38] SonofHorus82: could 9.2 end up being a combo of what was supposed to be 9.2 & 9.3?

[2:14:51] rohdey: sylvanas did say she wanted to BREAK THE CYCLE
[2:15:04] othraerir: brains!!!
[2:15:05] moshcraft: oh classic
[2:15:13] jeneraljelly: they debuff you and then smack oyu up
[2:15:20] simonbgg: Does anyone really care about the .5 patches anyway? Feels like something to fill the time with & just give us quailty of life stuff that dosnt really help the game with day to day content
[2:15:28] WowItsFrostyLOL: I don’t think sacrificing expansion content again is a good idea at all. Expansion cycle isn’t as important as making sure the expansion is worth playing.
[2:15:31] rohdey: what if; we go from a 2 year xpac cycle to a 3 year, w/ 4-5 patches/tiers? think it would be better?
[2:15:32] heatheraustin: @dudeinarobe Thanks!
[2:15:35] ricoNajt: if your ass hurts like that when it gets eaten out, you should really visit a doctor
[2:15:40] geokouts: Eat, you are thin
[2:16:02] moshcraft: the main problem with the wow dev cycle is that they've put themselves on a path where all content has to be created by blizz
[2:16:12] moshcraft: wow needs more emergent / player-generated content to be sustainable
[2:16:17] drmabusee: theres a pandemic raging for over a year. calm down.. this is so first world problems
[2:16:41] mrmanno14: Maybe they should end it at 9.2
[2:16:44] Aravarth: I mean, November / December 2022 is still two years from the release of Shadowlands, which was delayed to November 2020
[2:16:44] Artivicii: clam down
[2:16:45] Orthobullet: Maybe no 9.3
[2:16:46] Collected1: we'll all be playing new world by then
[2:16:50] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Don't forget that Mr. Krabs sold Spongebob's soul for 52 cents

[2:17:20] Camddogg: I agree with how long it’s taking them to put out content and patches it’s been too long. I just wonder how much was slowed and affected by the pandemic.
[2:17:25] geokouts: Eastern European and Balkan things :P
[2:17:26] pizzapatol: pizzapatol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:17:35] HaloS23: @Towelliee Just logged on..... HORY SHIT!!!! LOOK AT THAT ROOM!!!!!
[2:17:37] sinlesssinner: i am scared for 10.0 . Blizzard has been behind schedule it seems for the past 4 years, doubt they ll get back on track
[2:17:47] Camddogg: For me if it doesn’t go back to normal after Covid then there is something wrong
[2:17:48] Collected1: i always feel sorry for the larger kids who have larger parents. they just get bigger portions because that's what their parents eat.
[2:18:03] SonofHorus82: yeah he's at Light's Hope
[2:18:17] drmabusee: @lilrogueTV there are still restrictions in place. so maybe, just maybe this effects the slow rollout of patches..
[2:18:27] Wildside1177: Being Polish they escaped communism so they know what it is like to be hungry. Then they get here and everything is plentiful.
[2:18:46] moshcraft: @Towelliee do you think there's room in wow for more player-generated content / emergent gameplay
[2:18:58] simonbgg: They just legit create to little content compared to before.
[2:19:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HFC to Legion :)
[2:19:21] Odd3ty: When will 9.1 go live??
[2:19:24] sMoKe2501: i just tuned in, whats delayed?
[2:19:27] mavericks312: ppl act like everything has been normal the last year
[2:19:28] ArcaneSyntax: i dont understand the people who think this delay isnt because of covid.
[2:19:30] raymond3195: what about wod
[2:19:37] dalaraz: wasnt there a delay in shadowlands release?
[2:19:40] MrGattz: its not that wow doesnt have enough content.
[2:19:41] throwawaym3: too many content creaters that bitch about WoW poisoning the minds of everyone lol
[2:19:41] dreioo: three years of SL 2020Pajamas 2020Party
[2:19:49] Prideth: wasnt cata and legion delayed?
[2:19:49] chopsaki: chores or content??
[2:20:02] Arkadius92: @Towelliee Do you have any merch that are mens tank tops? if not do you recommend a brand to buy?
[2:20:10] ArcaneSyntax: 9.0 has a lot of shit to do, its just going on 7-8 months of that so it gets old.
[2:20:17] estradathenub: yeah it actually felt l ike an mmo
[2:20:36] manmower: you can do your maw, torghast, daily quests, and follower quests, that should keep you busy
[2:20:37] Ssikwow: People's drive to complete content is just too high, there's only so much Blizzard can provide.
[2:20:41] sMoKe2501: whats delayed?!?! i missed the conversation
[2:20:48] TuhrbanNovice: minus friend part bruh common
[2:20:52] h311yeadav: yup its up too you
[2:20:54] NeihanaNZ: like I get it, but if you're done with the game for now play something else right? Don't often get that op ;)
[2:20:55] Templexx: come to 2021 my friends
[2:21:00] FresheFefe: ahahaha so true
[2:21:04] Thunder4o: Garrosh said it
[2:21:05] othraerir: bobby has lots of change
[2:21:07] dreioo: @Ssikwow it's important to consider that people play the game very differently
[2:21:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: calm down Rocky
[2:21:09] crazzycards_tcg: wow is still very fun IMO
[2:21:12] TheBeastofCaerBannog: be thankful it changed, could be like Warhammer Online and die in 3 years
[2:21:12] mavericks312: and if the game didn't change ppl would complain how it hasn't changed lol
[2:21:12] darshanmx11: Towelliee how much did you change?
[2:21:13] MrGattz: we all change for ice change! POGGERS
[2:21:17] crazzycards_tcg: also sup guy
[2:21:19] Wildside1177: The old game is availble. Play it. I am playing it right now.
[2:21:20] PidiaP: Wow @towelliee isn’t homeless any more Kappa
[2:21:25] sMoKe2501: you're breaking the ribs rock
[2:21:29] WowItsFrostyLOL: Yeah idk what people are talking about “chores”. It’s an mmo there’s only a handful of things to do anyways. You got dungeons, raids, quests, and pvp. That’s how it’s always been.
[2:21:29] Alepouditsa: yes the made me deprest when the keep talking shit about it
[2:21:30] TheUnknowing: I made friends just fine, its called joining a guild! lol
[2:21:30] SpoonManes: stahp it
[2:21:31] darshanmx11: Towelliee classic coming soon?
[2:21:32] flyingfrog102: Lol the Ad i got when i came in the channel was how bad Vapping is for your body, and the first thing I see is Towel Vapping, Twitch needs to fix there adds lol
[2:21:38] FranciscoTheMage: OMG i just noticed the stream room is back
[2:21:39] dreioo: @Wildside1177 UNDEAD ROGUE?
[2:21:41] simonbgg: I understand what you're saying. But feels that the game have become such a systemdriven game, much more than it have to be. Feels so overcomplicated, like they focus on the systems & not the fun. Feels so bland!
[2:21:46] estradathenub: That wasnt what I stated. It just felt more of an MMO due to how interactive it was. Who cares about friends
[2:21:47] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee Can we get a close up tour?
[2:21:49] Artivicii: boosting KEKW
[2:21:53] Collected1: it's like the song. you can't always get what you want
[2:21:58] RhaedorRhae: There’s a crap ton of content, just kind of boring rn imo. Rather just watch someone play atm
[2:22:00] Terdnugget: @Towelliee it's been 17 years towelliee, life has changed
[2:22:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: people suck welcome to the internet
[2:22:01] dracullus: what a shocker
[2:22:02] dreioo: boosting...
[2:22:08] Skylin3r: it's the lack of single players Kappa
[2:22:11] sMoKe2501: (currently getting boosted while watching this stream and working) LUL
[2:22:11] Motivess: I for one am grateful the old game is available, can't stand retail
[2:22:13] LawnRaptor: shit I can't afford to play can't justify  the money vs time played
[2:22:14] mavericks312: just wait till classic wrath hits lol
[2:22:23] Wildside1177: @dreioo My original character was. yes.
[2:22:23] h311yeadav: wow its what you make off it !!
[2:22:24] AirmVn: you're a tank :)
[2:22:28] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee Hey I was just wondering will you be updating your classic UI for TBC
[2:22:31] Alepouditsa: if i had the heart i will be boosting for raid LUL
[2:22:40] Alepouditsa: my i love my gold
[2:22:40] dreioo: @Wildside1177 man, I'm good B)
[2:22:41] HCoffeePat: I enjoy watching streamers play WoW, I dislike to play WoW personally
[2:22:56] BeauregardRippy: raidboosting for gold is just a nice way to gear alts
[2:23:01] Alepouditsa: but*
[2:23:10] Cloudemon: dang dude the shelf looks great
[2:23:18] Wildside1177: @dreioo Although I am on my 60 mage atm.
[2:23:23] Motivess: I love logging into to do a few things, then log off and play other things
[2:23:28] dracullus: whaaat? it won't SAVE WOW?
[2:23:28] belfastcl: raid logging in tbc kicks in fairly quickly
[2:23:33] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee i remember there was so little to do in WoD i farmed that stupid apexis crystal mount without even trying.
[2:23:37] h311yeadav: love the shevles
[2:23:50] mavericks312: it feels nice to be able to take days off wow to play other games though
[2:24:02] SammyK_G: @Towelliee , don't forget isle dailies :)
[2:24:02] MiddlePhaze: SHOW US THE ROOM
[2:24:06] simonbgg: I think a thing that makes it feeling like there is less content & stuff to do is the fact that each patch make every other patch invisiable. There is no reason, there is no progression anymore in that sense. It ruins it abit for me atleast! @Towelliee
[2:24:14] darshanmx11: you do you girl
[2:24:23] Motivess: content that is endless becomes so dull and grinds your enthusiasm to dust
[2:24:35] Spoopyfoop: I played shadowlands and loved it! however, after awhile i got tired of doing the same shit over and over again and i want to get back into it but i just cant bring myself to doing so
[2:24:35] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:24:40] MiddlePhaze: HAS HE SHOWN THE ROOM
[2:24:42] FranciscoTheMage: what happened to DJ? did it dissolve? @Towelliee
[2:25:11] BeauregardRippy: this epic music feels so out of place here
[2:25:16] Caibo1: I hope they never bring AP farming though. I would rather raid log than have that come back
[2:25:16] Skylin3r: pet battles
[2:25:17] moshcraft: @Towelliee what about speed runs?
[2:25:18] Sneekzx: @Towelliee That's all that matters at the end of the day, great loot with great people. I think people over-look that important aspect of an MMO like WoW which what is built around.
[2:25:19] DeanoTV: @redut true getting sick of the community
[2:25:23] FranciscoTheMage: i love pet battles
[2:25:28] FranciscoTheMage: i do them
[2:25:28] Kinghorn: pet battles or bust
[2:25:39] othraerir: hahaha nice one
[2:25:48] moshcraft: in classic that's what the top end community focuses on since the content is easy but speedrunning is hard
[2:25:57] AkVansky: @towelliee good to see you have a good day
[2:26:00] FranciscoTheMage: believe it or not. people do pet battles
[2:26:00] Aravarth: omg true, I can't speedrun anything as a 40-year-old man lol
[2:26:01] popfizz26: Oh back in the new room... looks really good and good light color
[2:26:10] beanski10: there is not much like WoW arena out there 2v or 3v wish they could balance it better
[2:26:10] crazzycards_tcg: i think youre right @Towelliee like people watch these interviews and concern themselves with issues that dont affect their own play experience
[2:26:17] AkVansky: I'm trying to get back intonspeed running on mk64
[2:26:23] Privjet90: damn, you dont look 40
[2:26:34] ricoNajt: But dude, are you a bro? :D
[2:26:35] Motivess: I prefer the simpler design of wrath and BC for gearing too, nowadays there are so different things you need to do to get gear

[3:57:08] Phalamore: HE KNOWS
[3:57:25] Wholemane: Did they debunk the June 1st release?
[3:57:25] solsaver12: I hope prepatch gonna be at least a month
[3:57:33] generalmarcus35: is there for sure gonna be an announcement?
[3:57:37] steliyan31: Ahahahahahaha I really, really, really hope prepatch is out soon....  Retail is boring af, want to get to level my blood elf asap
[3:57:41] Sielu11628: @rayenlunzen they will announce Christmas
[3:57:43] lukaskar: Damn EU token price is still at 224k
[3:57:49] Felrane: Didn't they say they were going to let pally/shamans level before launch?
[3:57:50] solsaver12: lol
[3:58:01] temp3st98: LULW people crying about tbc coming out early LULW
[3:58:03] Kale_Nd: @Felrane yeah, level but not to 60
[3:58:07] Wholemane: They better effin release June 1st. Thats when Ill get 5 weeks off work!!!
[3:58:08] steliyan31: F the boost
[3:58:11] A_Klimas: they will probably sell boosties during pre-patch
[3:58:13] SilkeySmooth: @towelliee does gnome sequencer count as a red flag in the multiboxing ban?
[3:58:15] Heos90: the problem is that they not giving anyone much of a heads up
[3:58:16] Knocx: it fucking better
[3:58:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: i wanted the pvp set for paly but 2 weeks isnt enough time to level and do enough pvp for that
[3:59:04] CritcobainTV: you have 3 days to level to 60 Kappa
[3:59:05] steliyan31: I hope only people who know the game somewhat get that boost, otherwise it will be full of boosted noobs
[3:59:10] laughing_octopus: two weeks pre patch is bad in any way
[3:59:11] Wildside1177: If they draw that semantic difference they are garbage.
[3:59:20] Felrane: pretty sure they said they want you to level so you can go throught he dark portal with your friends
[3:59:22] Dooni: are you going to play paladin in tbc?
[3:59:28] mintallive: is he playing classic
[3:59:38] BearOfLight: I mean, they did imply that the goal was to let people be ready for outlands, but how much time they consider enough is the question
[3:59:42] dalaraz: why would the rest that are not interested in playing be or drainei have to wait 5 weeks for the rest to level :p 2-3 should be just fine
[3:59:46] steliyan31: I'm 1000% sure blizzard will never limit anything that may give them money xD
[3:59:47] A_Klimas: lol got bad news for ya, it 100% gonna be full of boosted newbies
[3:59:48] HolyDaizy: @steliyan31 ye because getting boosted by a mage to 60 is somehow different
[3:59:52] Brodih_: a lot of people say the want the full pvp set, but most wont make it through the BG grind for tokens
[3:59:56] KingTunaSalad: When Patch?
[4:00:00] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[4:00:04] Felrane: WoW doesn't really get new players
[4:00:04] Kinghorn: imagine thinking classic/tbc is so complicated that they wont know how to play the game
[4:00:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: that deluxe edition most likely includes a boost anyway
[4:00:13] Funderik: just over react andys
[4:00:18] techdough: boosting a warrior, so that if I want to play one, I don't have to effin leveling one...
[4:00:23] sabrinde: Thank you for saying that
[4:00:24] steliyan31: @steliyan31 That should be bannable imo xD
[4:00:25] Masqerader: most of the people who complain about that shit are noobs anyway
[4:00:27] TheUnknowing: I mean I'm 100% going to boost, just dont know what
[4:00:28] ArcaneSyntax: this shit aint hard to play either
[4:00:32] Heos90: only thing you really need a guide for is bis gear
[4:00:33] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee yeah a lot of warriors reolling to hunter or warlock
[4:00:36] pacokoi: There will be way more WoW players with boosted characters than actual noobs. Blizz knows this
[4:00:41] Wholemane: Why the fuck will there be boosts? Are they for 58 or 60?
[4:00:47] A_Klimas: 58
[4:00:48] VladVolynine: 58
[4:00:48] Wholemane: Nothing classic about that shit
[4:00:50] SilkeySmooth: imagine thinking new people are playing wow🤣🤣🤣
[4:00:50] Funderik: og wow has 300 buttons but you only press 3 lmao
[4:00:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: CT Raid
[4:00:52] zarisss: 68 kekw
[4:01:01] steliyan31: @steliyan31 Still.. Noobs rarely know about mage boosting tbh :D
[4:01:05] Wildside1177: @Wholemane Because people want to play BC not classic. This lets them do that.
[4:01:09] twangygnome: maexxna web wraps are a good timer
[4:01:26] VoriMori: I just started playing and it’s awesome watching someone experienced play, is it worth buying tokens? PokMachamp
[4:01:33] Heos90: lol
[4:01:37] hgizaira: you don't learn anything while leveling anyway
[4:01:40] taidg_: LULW Clap
[4:01:40] KingTunaSalad: CHEATERS
[4:01:41] throwawaym3: But towelliee old games = hard!!!
[4:01:43] Phalamore: a release date annoucement would be nice for those of us who want to take time off :D
[4:01:44] Funderik: the class discords are the best places to go for pre-bis and bis IMO
[4:01:47] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Fuck Tom Wilson
[4:01:48] TSquadSully: KEKW

[4:39:59] Blistz1: Holy shit, did this stream become unscuffed
[4:40:04] Broomba: in your first streaming house where you stream literally in living room and close to kitchen - was the floor carpet or wood? @towelliee

[4:40:51] DocsMistake: man there are already streamers playing the new Resident Evil game
[4:41:06] TheGaoSora: smol BibleThump
[4:41:09] Blistz1: awee
[4:41:38] Masqerader: kinda sucks when they don't have preload for others at least
[4:41:38] ScriptzSB: A game like that is a sit down game and dont get up LUL
[4:41:38] Broomba: towelliee does and plays games on his own time
[4:41:42] Masqerader: like the fuck capcom
[4:41:42] Blistz1: 10 am annoucement?
[4:41:42] wetfarts99: is resident evil goodz?
[4:41:44] BearOfLight: Wish I could join you for it, but I'm at work until 11
[4:41:52] Blistz1: what's the 10:00 am annoucment
[4:41:52] Xsilentghost: did you go over the bosses yet
[4:41:54] MrEvilRex: 8,9 ,10 what time is the announcement the time keeps going up
[4:41:55] DocsMistake: that is fair, the first person RE games are too stressful for me, I could barely play RE7
[4:41:55] BearOfLight: Which is like 2am for you
[4:42:08] Armdel: PC doesn't get preload...
[4:42:12] Masqerader: pc don't get it
[4:42:23] Armdel: but i don't think the game is more than like 40gb anyway
[4:42:34] MistaHat: @DocsMistake im not the biggest fan of the direction but apparently it is more intense throughout the game but not as scary
[4:42:37] Elwhappo: i have a pit lab mix and he's around 100lbs and a big baby also @Towelliee
[4:42:46] Skylin3r: at least PC getting it at the same time
[4:42:47] Masqerader: so its like an 8m download lol, nm
[4:43:00] theDirtyon3: you can delete the
[4:43:03] Collected1: wtf
[4:43:03] theDirtyon3: them*
[4:43:14] BearOfLight: Same, you have to jump through hoops to get just the ps5 version
[4:43:30] Skylin3r: honestly not a fan of the ps5 ui
[4:43:31] DocsMistake: the point is that you shouldnt need to delete it since it shouldnt download it in the first place
[4:43:33] subversv: the tech just isnt there yet
[4:43:39] Collected1: i hear the next version of the PS5 may already be on the way with slightly different internal parts to get around the shortages
[4:43:41] Broomba: is that in the settings to dl only ps5 version?
[4:43:41] abbotatoes: It'll get worked out as games start to be made with PS5 in mind rather than PS4
[4:43:52] Polysac: if you are taking bout games on the ps5 it will always download the ps5 version if there is a ps5 version
[4:43:52] Canden: whats giving you xp?
[4:43:59] Zetze3: what level can you start taking boost into ZG?
[4:43:59] izabeL: izabeL subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:44:08] evad1971: @Canden hes got a friend in there killing stuff
[4:44:11] MrEvilRex: I assume Sony did it that way because PS5 is not in stock and most of the players would be ps4? just a guess though
[4:44:30] ScriptzSB: certain combos of coins
[4:44:39] DocsMistake: I need to get an external HDD for my PS5 so i can have more storage, the bijous turn in one at a time
[4:44:51] DocsMistake: and just the first bijou gives xp
[4:44:58] BearOfLight: @MrEvilRex Except if you weren't on a PS5 you couldn't download the PS5 version
[4:45:08] Skylin3r: @MrEvilRex but why would they make ps5's download ps4 versions
[4:45:08] shogon: thought only first turn in gave xp
[4:45:09] Polysac: docsmistake buy a ssd ?
[4:45:32] Polysac: that is correct
[4:45:45] Broomba: how long is ony vets visist usually?
[4:45:52] BearOfLight: You could do it alreay but only ps4 games could go on them. The update lets you store PS5 games on external drives
[4:46:12] SpoofAvatar: like 600 turns or so can level you from 58 to 60
[4:46:15] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)

[4:47:02] DocsMistake: you will play it some time before part 2 comes out lol
[4:47:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah might as well wait for the ps5 upgrade at this point
[4:47:08] OC_Yeti: Wow lost me last month to final fantasy online

[4:47:31] dawnte96: Hey @towelliee, we’re you a big tbc guy?
[4:47:38] MrEvilRex: @MrEvilRex Sony may not have built in  hardware detection into PS4/5 so they cannot do it or they just have not gotten around to it... I do not know I'm just speaking as a coder, it is not always "Why don't they just do x"
[4:47:40] chapperz18: how is towellie levelling?
[4:47:51] BearOfLight: yeah
[4:47:56] S1appadabass: ya you get a free upgrade

[4:48:11] Xsilentghost: Karl'thas boss room seems small for how the fight is described in dungeon journal.
[4:48:16] CritcobainTV: @Gingerprimer I'm not a guy >:(
[4:48:21] Collected1: two weeks pre-patch is going to kill BC for me
[4:48:27] jakehembree: nice
[4:48:29] CritcobainTV: i mean, im a guy but im more than just a guy
[4:48:34] dalaraz: @Collected1 why though
[4:48:34] shogon: farm gear and mats to feed pally...ya
[4:48:42] Collected1: dalaraz : no time to level up

[4:49:30] Blistz1: wait what wow news
[4:49:31] woody879: whats the wow news just got here
[4:49:35] Jittx: get them in ah
[4:49:38] Jittx: super cheap
[4:49:41] dalaraz: @Collected1 yeah thats not the best outcome but,it aint that serious i think,make you not play the game at all
[4:49:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:49:41] zMalloc: I'm re rolling to shaman (alliance) I need at least a little bit of time to lvl to 60.
[4:49:41] Collected1: every classic streamer i watch says the same thing, 4-6 weeks
[4:49:46] shogon: i could see prepatch being extended for 9.1 out for a month then tbc in july @Towelliee
[4:49:54] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:49:56] Cidarr: Q2 ends June 30 so Activision needs to release something before then for their bottom line
[4:50:01] Jittx: oof.
[4:50:03] DocsMistake: man so many people are super salty about the potential of 2 week pre-patch, it will be funny when people realize that you dont need like 6 paladins in each raid group, and i guess the rest are dirty alliance players
[4:50:09] Iflon: Whats your thought of smaller changes to tbc then? you cool with that or within certain limits?
[4:50:16] SilkeySmooth: how would you makeoney on your warrior mining?
[4:50:19] Collected1: dalaraz : the way i see it if i'm not at the gates @ level 60 the moment BC goes live it's not worth doing at all.
[4:50:28] Waspire: i can buy  them and transfer a toon
[4:50:34] Holysal: you need like 368 of each for 58-60
[4:50:39] MrEvilRex: what about Q4?
[4:50:40] Masqerader: diablo 2 might dominate q3
[4:50:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: diablo 2 resurrected will dominate q4
[4:50:49] dalaraz: @Collected1 we are in different sides on that but i get your feeling
[4:51:16] inc3nd: what was the big announcement? or nothing yet?
[4:51:19] Collected1: dalaraz : i suspect this may just be the excuse i needed anyway. I never hit 60 in classic.
[4:51:21] Colt_Engineer: Diablo Immortal...do ya'll not have phones?
[4:51:24] Jittx: jittx subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:51:33] Holysal: they said on the calls D2R is first to release
[4:51:36] Jittx: this man doesnt get enough subs.
[4:51:42] dalaraz: @Collected1 thats another story :D
[4:51:43] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[4:51:43] lovecult85: like shadowlands an naxx? :D
[4:51:45] Blistz1: patch 9.2 is Q4
[4:51:51] Jittx: give this man some twitch primes

[4:52:25] Collected1: diablo immortal rising from the ashes

[4:52:42] ch1rpz: Shill
[4:52:44] Jitox: Im really excited to have a REAL game on my phone finally
[4:52:49] Hirukai: Do you play on Whitemane?
[4:52:49] dalaraz: tbh none would have any issue with a 25duration prepatch
[4:52:55] ArcaneSyntax: anyone else getting ULTRA high ping lately on Illidan?
[4:52:55] WowItsFrostyLOL: Yeah but dude don’t you know? mObIlE gAmEs BaD!!
[4:52:57] LeonardLongNips: I barely got time to play PC games let alone mobile games
[4:53:04] Holysal: @Hirukai Azuresong
[4:53:05] ThaOriginalGamester: i was saying that after all the memes... it's gonna be the killer app and y'all gonna run out and get S20 Notes to play
[4:53:06] Collected1: i would laugh so hard if immortal became one of their biggest recent hits
[4:53:09] DocsMistake: !TBC
[4:53:09] Moobot: @DocsMistake TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[4:53:22] Kalidin79: I'm sure immortal will be fine as a mobile game. The whole point was no one asked for it.
[4:53:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: im bored AF at work most of the time diablo immortal will see some use there
[4:53:32] Heos90: interstellar is so good
[4:53:38] Medobolt: innerstellar Kreygasm
[4:53:39] DrakhanGaming: havent seen it yet
[4:53:40] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: BibleThump
[4:53:45] snuffles_80: I can watch interstellar over and over again
[4:53:46] DocsMistake: I watched Without Remorse the other day, I am not sure how I feel about it lol
[4:53:46] cineris_3: love interstellar
[4:53:48] Holy_Z: watched that a month or two ago again so good
[4:53:49] Heos90: me and my bud when we saw it in theatre were like wait its over its been 3hours

[4:53:59] Timeler: Tennet?
[4:53:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: come on TARS
[4:54:07] gwar234: god that was a good movie but dam was it sad
[4:54:10] WowItsFrostyLOL: Memes aside the thing about diablo immortal is just that people thought they would announce Diablo 4 instead. I for one am pumped for immortal.
[4:54:13] Phalamore: You want to watch a shitty space movie?....watch "stowaway" on netflix
[4:54:14] DrakhanGaming: Shutter Island was a really good mind fuck
[4:54:14] RocketMan23: inception was a bigger mind fuck
[4:54:17] IronMajdnem: this xp bar addon is awesome
[4:54:18] ScratchSpy: Tenet is even harder for me
[4:54:19] LeonardLongNips: Tennet wasnt as good as people said it was imo
[4:54:20] Holy_Z: I couldnt make it through the first hour of Tenet, seems shit
[4:54:29] DrakhanGaming: Tenet was straight up booty
[4:54:32] xXSiebzehnXx: Shutter island and inception were both great
[4:54:37] cineris_3: Tenet was ok
[4:54:39] Jitox: a good thing about the cinema is that you cant check how much time is left
[4:54:50] Jitox: i mean, you can check online yeah
[4:54:55] ch1rpz: Damn I’m bummed to hear Tenet was not great
[4:55:07] LeonardLongNips: Tennet was a big ol EH

[4:55:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: no one talks during the movie when I watch at my house, I hope at home releases continues
[4:55:34] ThaOriginalGamester: After playing Genshin Impact, it changed my mind on mobile gaming. The way it's cloud-save/cross-platform is revolutionary
[4:55:39] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 2001 is crazy too
[4:55:45] Broomba: interseller from 2014?
[4:55:45] ArcaneSyntax: Towelliee bout to hit 60 without going to silithus

[4:56:19] MIKEBRASKA: I followed Inception pretty well, I know people that got headaches from it lol, but never really struck me as being really that crazy. Shutter Island got me WAAAAAaY more
[4:56:21] Solbar60: Spoiler Alert!!!
[4:56:24] jakehembree: ever watch the martian matt damon
[4:56:25] Dreepi: supp yall
[4:56:45] robertjordan83: @Towelliee interstellar is only a mindfuck is you dont understand that time is really just a construct of how we preceive reality and not something actually tangiable... which most people dont
[4:57:02] ThaOriginalGamester: @Jitox it is the future of gaming, tbh
[4:57:04] ch1rpz: Damn someone is trying to sound smart
[4:57:18] WowItsFrostyLOL: @robertjordan83 depends on who you ask. Time is a real force not just a perception.
[4:57:27] minael1: @Towelliee is it considered throwing if i use the legendary that makes avenger shield reset more often?

[4:58:46] snuffles_80: its a good thing
[4:58:50] robertjordan83: we can only perceive reality in 3 dimensions, which is why we have constructs like time. time exists but how we perceive time is not really how its exists. its just how it looks to us in 3 dimensions

[5:52:35] Bacon_21: I'll just be playing poe in my wow downtime LUL
[5:52:36] Nimz83: The toys are not for retail
[5:52:36] DocsMistake: I wonder if the deluxe edition mount scales with your riding speed or if you have to have epic riding to use it
[5:52:40] woodchuck91: lol WoW is looking more and more like PoE in terms of cosmetic microstransactions
[5:52:40] Nimz83: It says it in the description

[5:52:44] kurlook: They're taking after skyrim rereleases lol
[5:52:46] AtomicHeartSon: If the digital deluxe is more than $50 USD that's insane
[5:52:58] solsaver12: How said to have to pay for tbc again
[5:52:58] CrunkyBrewster: yeha im lost here too. do we have to pay for tbc classic?
[5:53:02] Tigerklaue: 60 for a mount and toys?
[5:53:03] Asyia3: @Zerofkgiven No. Just the lvl boost
[5:53:03] solsaver12: sad*
[5:53:07] TheGaoSora: @Nimz83 well they better change it since it's more usable in retail KEKW
[5:53:11] NOHITJEROME: im panicking LUL
[5:53:13] NOHITJEROME: im not ready
[5:53:14] submotion: is the mount gonna be account wide or on one char? @Towelliee
[5:53:14] Rottencoarse: @Doki_Crunku  nope you shouldnt you just pay for the boost
[5:53:15] Sollice: You do not have to pay for TBC classic its in your regular WoW sub
[5:53:15] crawcook: No, you pay for the goodies.
[5:53:23] Sollice: These are all add on features, cosmetics or boosts
[5:53:25] NOHITJEROME: LUL
[5:53:25] Waspire: Why not find a horde server thats populated with boosters and trasnfer over to azuresong after u hit 60
[5:53:25] theaccountant219: @solsaver12 you don't have to pay again???
[5:53:26] Lifestream7: Dude I am not even going to try to lvl right away in Hellfire its going to be a nightmare. i thought Classic starting areas were bad at release now everyone is going to be stuffed into one area
[5:53:28] Biorrwolf: @nohitjerome "YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!"

[5:54:01] shimwood: I'm not ready, probably just going to boost my Druid so I can focus on retail LuL
[5:54:04] Collected1: yup
[5:54:05] Collected1: not wrong
[5:54:10] Collected1: 2 week is screwed up

[5:54:35] WeedIsMySin__: People when classic released :
[5:54:41] A_Klimas: 2 weeks leveling a belf when those starting zones are gonna be hell hahah
[5:54:42] Sollice: 7/13 maybe?
[5:54:47] superphunphap: everyone  works to boost up all toons then they just allow you to pay now lol
[5:54:48] Rudric_Ice: asmonUH asmonUH sodaSUFFER sodaSUFFER
[5:54:48] Waspire: level 58  then  spend 700g to get  to 60
[5:54:49] TheGaoSora: yeah but the toy has more meaning
[5:54:51] WeedIsMySin__: Blizzard would never offer boosts in classic KEKW
[5:54:52] AjjtheDK: I now hate comments sections on WoW stuff anymore. always toxic asf
[5:54:53] ekijnn: what about 9.1 ? :(
[5:54:53] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @hailstormz (warning)
[5:54:53] Bacon_21: PepegaCredit
[5:54:57] CrunkyBrewster: the thing is, thats a guaranteed mount

[5:55:15] darshanmx11: asmonE2 asmonE2
[5:55:16] Kuzzin: @Towelliee think they will bring back sharding for pre patch lvling?
[5:55:17] Biorrwolf: Just going to keep working on my hunter until the Belf zones aren't overly congested
[5:55:20] DocsMistake: @Waspire unless prices go up severely it wont cost 700g to go 58-60
[5:55:20] CrunkyBrewster: so you buy it, and the only thing you need to pay gold for is the flying
[5:55:21] NovaSun84: people bitch and still do the actions anyways KEKW
[5:55:24] WeedIsMySin__: E TU KEKW
[5:55:24] cordawg: Is it one for BC and one for Retail.
[5:55:33] Asyia3: there's another post on wowhead talking about the steps on choosing the expansion
[5:55:35] A_Klimas: but what speed is it? is it an epic mount?
[5:55:39] ProllyDrinkin: Cant wait for my BOOST!   1-58 is the worst exp ever!
[5:55:42] CrunkyBrewster: oh wait its not flying nevermind
[5:55:48] cordawg: Whats the buring feet thing?
[5:55:52] xEskii: and the riders are wearing diff gear for the game its for
[5:55:52] hailstormz: ones mad ugly lol
[5:55:56] Orcan3: So only the mount is available for Retail?
[5:56:01] Zapotek_S: I will wait for sales 50 % wont buy it now
[5:56:01] stallowned: it better be 280% speed if u have to pay for it
[5:56:01] NOHITJEROME: LUL true
[5:56:04] Chiraakitteh: Let’s see, classic included in retail sub, people complaining that new content (for classic) is free, but company is selling cosmetics
[5:56:06] jorrih: it's about having time during prepatch
[5:56:09] Chiraakitteh: LuvOops
[5:56:09] jorrih: not before
[5:56:10] ProllyDrinkin: it sucks
[5:56:11] SpacedOut: no time to level blood elves/dranei
[5:56:11] Jakosin: More time during prepatch
[5:56:14] Cloudemon: not to level their blood elves though
[5:56:18] biggieheals: not for BE/ draenai
[5:56:20] therealdemps: can u boost a character in prepatch?
[5:56:22] zodd_amhai: yeah what about people who want to level bloodelf
[5:56:23] Stupifly: can u level BE on pre patch?
[5:56:24] crawcook: No time for belf or dranei though

[5:56:36] Sollice: Yes you can level BE and Dranei in pre patch
[5:56:37] Lumaro: its 2 weeks more than we had on actual tbc launch
[5:56:37] Tigerklaue: i think alot horde player wanna play belf
[5:56:37] Kuzzin: @Towelliee you think they will bring back sharding for lvling in pre patch?
[5:56:39] Zerofkgiven: imagine having to level your paladin / shaman in 2 weeks KEKW
[5:56:40] death_fisted: they said prepatch would be a very long time
[5:56:41] KythosMeltdown: they want people to feel rushed so they buy the boost instead pepeG
[5:56:45] CrunkyBrewster: hell yeah 2 Wrath!!
[5:56:49] crawcook: What is the point of such pre patch though?
[5:56:51] sh1asurprise: They probably purposefully gave too short time to stagger population at launch
[5:56:51] Biorrwolf: Hopefully the faster leveling speeds actually make a difference
[5:56:57] iblink22: @Towelliee think someone will break the 4 day record for 1-70 on a BE/draenei when TBC launched?
[5:56:58] Sollice: You can not boost BE and Draeni

[5:57:03] DocsMistake: people are so fucking entitled now, they didnt have to give us a chance to level blood elfs or dranei, so 2 weeks is better than nothing
[5:57:06] arrk___: THIS FEELS RUSHED AS FUCK NOO BLIZZARD
[5:57:07] iceproxx: 9.1 in 3 months atleast LUL
[5:57:11] twanlol: they do it to sell boosts... imagine if that was true LUL
[5:57:11] cineris_3: at least P1 is light on raiding content, mostly attunements and leveling
[5:57:11] mavericks312: I'd bet 9.1 is June 29th
[5:57:13] jerexify: @Towelliee I need a good DPS class to use the boost on. Any suggestions? I was pretty young for BC, so don't remember too well.
[5:57:16] jorrih: 2 week pre patch literally makes it null and void. no time for anything during such a unique time
[5:57:18] Sollice: So there is no rush to boost those. You have known for months that TBC was coming so you could have been working on other classes/races
[5:57:22] Brodih_: All the mats in the AH with skyrocket starting today
[5:57:22] ZagFan590: Early July for 9.1 seems like a safe bet.
[5:57:23] Jakosin: You get another chance at your name when transfering to BC server too
[5:57:23] PG_diesel: I know people who were waiting for xp nerf to level
[5:57:24] Biorrwolf: @lumaro That's a good point 👉👈👇🤔👌👍
[5:57:25] Phantomstrk: Have they confirmed the servers list yet as there was talk of adding new servers for tbc launch
[5:57:25] purpgarma: True
[5:57:30] Eastchickenz: 2 weeks prepatch is a joke
[5:57:30] Burntlettuce: naw this is exactly because 9.1 is in August. increase their subs for quarter 1 still
[5:57:33] Zerofkgiven: why cant people play the game normally when its released? Why do you have to have prepatch leveling?
[5:57:40] Bulgogiprince: Think about it. Business wise the end of the Quarter is the end of June. Shareholders need to see that money.
[5:57:49] xecksi: ugh not gonna have enough time to gear
[5:57:49] Biorrwolf: @jerexify Hunters and Warlocks are devastating in TBC apparently
[5:57:51] Tarfu: you think 2 weeks is enough or no?
[5:57:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: we need some clarifaction on what time we start though Monday June 1st doesn't exist and May 31st is a holiday so it might actually be Tuesday June 1st that NA starts
[5:57:56] Eastchickenz: All about the money for the quarer
[5:57:56] danny_way: pretty sad I'm prob gonna have to leave the Belf Hpali behind
[5:57:58] Eastchickenz: quarter
[5:58:01] rocthenite: asmongold have his take
[5:58:07] CrunkyBrewster: ooof fancy
[5:58:08] Holysal: @Eastchickenz yep
[5:58:10] CrunkyBrewster: ooh*
[5:58:14] coldhandsbeatz: I know it wasnt an option back in the day. But now that they are doing it, whats the point of not giving at least1month to level instead of 2 weeks
[5:58:15] Zkx_: eh im in no hurry to get my belf to 60, ill miss the chaos at the begininng on the expansion which is good lol
[5:58:15] kurlook: Can you boost and then use the clone service? lol
[5:59:08] Rudric_Ice: asmonUH
[5:59:11] NOHITJEROME: interesting
[5:59:19] CrunkyBrewster: oooh so they are separating the games
[5:59:21] hailstormz: addon clusterfuck inc
[5:59:24] WeedIsMySin__: This might be a 3Head question but i started playing WoW 1 year ago so i dont understand this yet: Someone told me that you can NOT take your classic character into TBC. So how are you supposed to level your TBC character in the pre-patch when you cant take said character into TBC?
[5:59:35] Rudric_Ice: WOAH POGGERS
[5:59:36] jerexify: @Towelliee I need a good DPS class to use the boost on. Any suggestions? I was pretty young for BC, so don't remember too well.
[5:59:38] death_fisted: Bobby needs more money

[6:00:21] NovaSun84: Naw, Blizzard is restoring a new character with cloning.  They have been charging us this for years.
[6:00:22] DHspeedy: obviously a fee has to be there or people woulld constantly use the service. A paywall stops a bit of the traffic.
[6:00:24] NOHITJEROME: that makes sense
[6:00:30] hailstormz: Meta dps for TBC are BM hunts and locks for those looking to boost

[6:05:24] danny_way: 9.1?
[6:05:28] ArcaneSyntax: only 2 weeks to grind my rank 14 pvp gear
[6:05:34] CrunkyBrewster: oh dear.. they think 9.1 is close?
[6:05:34] DHspeedy: This is only a problem for rerolling, I have no need for a long pre-patch :P
[6:05:35] magecrimes: the 9.1 rumor date was June 29th right?
[6:05:40] Ant9912: They might have done that to try and split some ppl so its not a HUGE zergfest (even though it still will be)
[6:05:44] danny_way: we wanted a longer PP
[6:05:45] Tigerklaue: why not release pre patch now?
[6:05:45] Burntlettuce: I'm surprised prepatch isn't next week tbh

[6:06:37] Exxcar: it will mess with addons

[6:06:56] stallowned: hope its a ez copy paste of addon folders
[6:07:03] CaptainGrodan: Its the same for everyone. Nothing unfair here.
[6:07:03] Amygdalya: So what date can we start leveling the new races
[6:07:05] CrunkyBrewster: it just means whatever app you're using for wow addons, will have to be updated to use the different games. no different than how we have it now with retail and classic
[6:07:24] blvdxoxo: @Amygdalya 18th
[6:07:49] t_800_i: noice
[6:07:52] VladVolynine: monkaS c.. clones?
[6:07:59] superphunphap: money money money! mooooney!

[6:08:20] WeedIsMySin__: ugh, why does it have to be so fucking confusing..
[6:08:27] ThisIsAsabel: "Thanks for purchasing our optional character clone service for 35dollars US" Kappa
[6:08:30] Tomaterrs: towelception
[6:08:38] NovaSun84: Nope
[6:08:39] flebbooo: yeah pretty much
[6:08:42] CrunkyBrewster: i imagine
[6:08:42] coldhandsbeatz: its just called the same haha
[6:08:44] NovaSun84: 2 seperate servers, they just share the name
[6:08:44] crazzycards_tcg: phasing?
[6:08:48] Mystirose: so you can't create a new character in the normal warcraft server?
[6:08:49] gonziav: two different games
[6:08:52] khronicz: khronicz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 80 months! 
[6:08:52] itsblando: 2 servers, same character
[6:08:53] CrunkyBrewster: because they're two different games essentially
[6:08:57] Exxcar: They are different servers with the same name
[6:08:58] NovaSun84: 2 different games, 2 different servers
[6:08:58] Heos90: it just copies the character to a classic server
[6:08:59] Bruhnders: Question: Can i level on a PVE server and then after a while transfer to PVP?
[6:09:00] Sollice: It's a copy of the server but its a seperate server
[6:09:04] robertjordan83: @Towelliee didnt they say classic and tbc classic are different clients?
[6:09:05] Dirtnose: @Mystirose You can
[6:09:06] Alienfromger: no you need 2nd client right?
[6:09:10] Exxcar: You won't see TBC characters on the Classic era servers
[6:09:12] cmssd: @Sollice so a clone
[6:09:12] LeonardLongNips: 2 games
[6:09:16] kazobtw: what do you think the price of clone will be ?
[6:09:17] CrunkyBrewster: i'm not surprised they went this route honestly
[6:09:20] Sollice: Yes
[6:09:21] coldhandsbeatz: they should merge classic servers into a few to keep them well populated
[6:09:22] NinjaGlovz: Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap
[6:09:23] NovaSun84: Classic removes the prepatch right?
[6:09:30] Holysal: @kazobtw my guess $19.99
[6:09:30] Dirtnose: Yes
[6:09:30] superphunphap: classic era gonna die hard
[6:09:30] movit1: NO
[6:09:30] Sollice: Probably
[6:09:31] Jermo11: yup
[6:09:32] zestyzebra1: YEP
[6:09:32] Phalamore: DED
[6:09:33] LeonardLongNips: yes
[6:09:34] NovaSun84: Nope
[6:09:34] Shugaze: its gonna be trash
[6:09:34] Weeaboo__Chad: Maybe if they keep jsut one lmao
[6:09:34] flebbooo: oh yeah 100% KEKW
[6:09:35] Burntlettuce: 100%
[6:09:36] Exxcar: Totally
[6:09:38] movit1: Merge ofcourse
[6:09:38] Dirtnose: they should just do like 2-3 phase 6 classics.
[6:09:39] Motivess: @bruhnders if you look at the transfer rules it specifically states no
[6:09:40] purpgarma: Fresh servers or they die yeah
[6:09:40] Brodih_: they are going to merge for sure
[6:09:40] Holysal: yep
[6:09:41] DocsMistake: hell yes, classic era servers will be so vacant
[6:09:44] Phalamore: If you noticed, they have already set it up for merges
[6:09:45] Sollice: You think you want to keep Classic, but you don't
[6:09:46] wheeze_dk: merge servers, ye... but i think its super nice they keep classic servers.
[6:09:46] NovaSun84: I'm ensuring all my lvl 60s are on Classic server
[6:09:47] podden: 40-50$ for dark portal pass ?79.99 for deluxe ?
[6:09:51] edsyw: Nah, bigger ones will survive
[6:09:51] ArcaneSyntax: deader than they were 6 months into classic.
[6:09:55] Grizly922: 1june poh
[6:09:56] Bruhnders: @Motivess Thanks, couldnt find them
[6:09:57] Grizly922: pog
[6:09:58] flebbooo: they will most diffiently do cross servers like in retail eventually
[6:09:59] magecrimes: Classic Era needs to do seasons or something where it starts up over again while everyone else moves onto the expansion
[6:10:00] Rudric_Ice: classic will be dead PepeHands
[6:10:02] korn66: we need fresh classic
[6:10:03] reyfa123: classics vanilla dies
[6:10:04] chadleyhank: Pog pog pog
[6:10:05] A_Klimas: then you get to pay $25 for a server transfer later on Kappa
[6:10:11] averis12: Sharding?
[6:10:11] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:10:11] Holysal: @podden prob $60 for the pass
[6:10:11] wheeze_dk: It doesnt matter, its still cool to get to play classic whenever u want.
[6:10:15] BRUTALIT0PS: I will have a character on the classic servers for sure since I never actually experienced Vanilla endgame
[6:10:16] Thoreya: do i boost a mage/hunter or mage/spriest hmmmmm
[6:10:17] Mystirose: seems dumb because any new chars you create still have to go through classic before reaching BC
[6:10:18] Dirtnose: They need to do like 1-2 vanilla era servers that way all the playerbase can be together. I think one of each will just end up with like 95% of them being dead af
[6:10:22] cmssd: whats the point on wanting to stay on classic
[6:10:25] TMMOOF: they will phase classic most likely
[6:10:27] NovaSun84: Classic era will continue just fine.  It will require server merges though for sure
[6:10:29] NinjaGlovz: towHAMUP WeSmart towHAMUP WeSmart towHAMUP WeSmart
[6:10:40] Burntlettuce: then you will have 3 instances of your character when Wrath comes out
[6:10:41] CrunkyBrewster: to be real though, how they're doing this is going to have problems on prepatch. watch
[6:10:42] NovaSun84: I went to TBC already, fuck doing it again to "join the crowd"
[6:10:43] Tarfu: I want my Tarfu name on my Shaman but they don't offer name changes
[6:10:45] averis12: Time capsule your character I guess is also a thing
[6:10:47] blvdxoxo: then blizz come out 'you think you do, but you dont'
[6:10:47] Rudric_Ice: sodaSUFFER sodaSUFFER sodaSUFFER sodaSUFFER sodaSUFFER
[6:10:49] flebbooo: yuup KEKW
[6:10:50] Heos90: or show me the money
[6:10:56] coldhandsbeatz: Merging classic servers seems like a way better idea than phasing there
[6:10:59] edsyw: There has been consistent amount of ppl playing vanilla for +10 years, there will always be vanilla community
[6:11:12] xEskii: these classic games suck, wish theyd just work on making the actual game better

[6:11:37] Dirtnose: @ekkex They move from fresh to fresh though as private servers close at a quick rate usually. Not sure how many wanna stay on a dead end phase 6 realm forever. We'll see though
[6:11:37] Mrone_: did we get any date for the prepatch?
[6:11:38] flebbooo: rdy for that EZ warrior boost
[6:11:42] GoKu1g: It's all a big money making scheme, but it will payoff tho thats the thing
[6:11:47] Holysal: @ekkex yep bc of fresh starts. everything is done. so i doubt it. unless on ps
[6:11:48] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™

[6:11:50] ColdIceCreamMan: i honestly dont know why people are so salty... there is nothing wrong with anything they do
[6:11:54] Rudric_Ice: do you get the TCG heathstone on retail or just TBC ?
[6:12:01] stallowned: theres probably a cap?
[6:12:06] Somakutala: It happens at the same time, so it can't be cloned
[6:12:06] subversv: @Biorrwolf wow music
[6:12:08] Exxcar: @Towelliee how is the game room treating you? towHAMUP
[6:12:08] snuffles_80: isnt there a cap?

[6:12:23] WowItsFrostyLOL: @towelliee well how big were vanilla servers back in the day? Weren’t they quite small?
[6:12:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: once the gold goes to classic you can't bring it back to TBC
[6:12:24] flebbooo: wait, what if people start trading the snapshoted gold over to tbc with other players? KEKW
[6:12:28] blvdxoxo: @meijtricks  1
[6:12:30] GoKu1g: NAmes taken? who gives a fk, WHO ARE THEY lol! Unknowns...
[6:12:32] korn66: only 2 weeks to level belf?
[6:12:42] EpicJune: taking bets on how much this is gonna go tits up somehow
[6:12:46] Dirtnose: @meijtricks There's no fresh TBC realms. The current vanilla realms will move to TBC at launch. If you make a new character you start at level 1 like normal

[6:13:49] DocsMistake: now to figure out how much time I can afford to miss from work
[6:13:50] Heos90: its only good if someone is staying and they have a lot of gold and they let u pay to clone so u can take their gold and yours to tbc and you give them theirs back in vanilla
[6:13:50] Lumpy_Shawnicus: Imagine playing in Classic still when TBC exists.

[6:29:16] jxxpn: Why do you need a Cloning Service?
[6:29:17] Wildside1177: The 1/account will be gone very soon.
[6:29:17] GarSeason: With just 2 weeks to lvl ur shaman or paly, people will look to boost instead of just playing the game with that limited time frame.

[6:29:33] Nico_vdM: FYI Cloning is where you can play same character on both Classic and TBC Classic at same time
[6:29:34] Collected1: it should be free surely
[6:29:37] K_A_N_J_I: Bc is free if you have a wow sub this is just extra stuff you can get
[6:29:40] foxies_havocing: Classis has always been a mistake.
[6:29:43] Sincline387: 35 per=blizzard can shut down servers sooner.

[6:29:46] The_Boctor: leave no survival hunters
[6:29:47] EthicalHermit: @alexfdez17 thank you
[6:29:47] Bazsidiver: just launch fresh vanilla servers
[6:29:48] rhodeos_: not gonna lie, I'm happy for the boost being 40, but 35 dollars is greedy
[6:29:49] Biorrwolf: @foxies_havocing Unless Shadowlands keeps being what it is, leaving Classic as a more substantial item
[6:29:50] N3_Destro: @Towelliee its the same price as realm transfer in retail right?
[6:29:51] theNxe: do you think thats why they dont give much time between pre patch and luanch , so more people pay for character copy
[6:29:52] BRUTALIT0PS: Well boost is only 40 at least
[6:29:54] Krizmo3: It's like buying a lottery ticket. Spend $35 on a character you won't play any more
[6:29:58] GarSeason: @Sincline387 There it is dude.
[6:29:58] mavau: @foxies_havocing Amen brother
[6:29:59] garkhyt: It's definitely to cover the cost of running those servers
[6:30:03] we_are_whomp: i think theyre going to lower it later down the road but put it in now just so people play bc first
[6:30:04] AngelDivRS: AngelDivRS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[6:30:07] SicDogg: lol i thought tbc would b free

[6:30:11] Kinghorn: maybe 5
[6:30:27] N3_Destro: oh no @Towelliee its the same price as realm / faction transfers.
[6:30:30] LucidAntics: @SicDogg its free with your subscription, what are you talking about.

[6:30:43] foxies_havocing: You can never relive an amazing experience you lived 15 years ago and should never try and replicate it. By doing so you belittle it.

[6:31:31] Krizmo3: Killing boars really gets it going for some
[6:31:33] Yagr6: how much is it to boost a new character on TBC server?
[6:31:37] Biorrwolf: Fresh Hottub Streams you say?
[6:31:44] SlowpokeIsAGamer: We partying like it's 2008 tonight.
[6:31:45] Bulgogiprince: Original guild back when I started wow was called Splash Fight
[6:31:47] jeziorek: how much euro for the boost?
[6:31:51] iblink22: @Towelliee we need a longer pre-patch than 2 weeks
[6:32:01] LucidAntics: So if im playing draenei shaman im pretty fucked :)
[6:32:01] Exodeo_: lvl 38 myself ..lets go
[6:32:07] fistofnature: when 9.1? :)
[6:32:10] Collected1: so 1-60 in 2 weeks, how many hours per day is that
[6:32:12] mmrghost7: but if u want alliaince shaman it's not enough time
[6:32:13] Reznr: Isnt there XP requirement changes in the prepatch tho
[6:32:17] techdough: 44 drood !!! goooooo
[6:32:17] Xilyane: can ya level a druin in 40 levels in 3 weeks? haha
[6:32:18] Biorrwolf: Lv20 Hunter as of today
[6:32:18] OdyBro: well i wanna play shaman but also raid 3x a week on retail so this 2 weeks kinds sucks
[6:32:24] VictorAvalanche: does pre patch lower the amount of exp to get to 60 or does it make it faster?
[6:32:32] t_800_i: im excited
[6:32:38] korn66: i cant play 12 hours a day
[6:32:38] Biorrwolf: It's too last minute to change. They'd have to do it this Tuesday
[6:32:43] LucidAntics: @Reznr doesnt matter, only having essentially one reset on raids isnt enough to get geared enough for the start of outlands.
[6:32:44] Sollice: ass lizards
[6:32:47] mrcellal: @VictorAvalanche  I believe so
[6:32:48] Exxcar: @VictorAvalanche it should if its 2.4.3
[6:32:48] Squirrel_nutty: i get my jab on the 12th ill be over the side affects by the 18th so its win win
[6:33:03] mavericks312: i think if they push tbc back it will be after 9.1 release whihc might be august
[6:33:08] janschuim: @Towelliee can I continue with my classic character and then clone to TBC when i get to 60?
[6:33:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: TRUE KEKW
[6:33:14] CrunkyBrewster: they got a point
[6:33:20] JerBoody: Blizzard needs to give me more time to play current content....where the fuck is the new content already? It’s like the queen azshara fight
[6:33:31] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Copy is way more expensive than I'd wanted. But at least it's a system where you can choose to clone anytime, not "you have to decide NOW"
[6:33:34] Biorrwolf: @janschuim why not move it to TBC right away for the faster leveling?
[6:33:36] Rudric_Ice: should be FREE
[6:33:40] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: It should just be your entire account
[6:33:41] blascotwitch: @Towelliee are you doing raid tests today?
[6:33:49] mmrghost7: yeah dude classic is done af
[6:33:54] CrunkyBrewster: this is to pay back Bobby
[6:33:55] VBTIGER89: Covid fees lol
[6:33:56] MrBlkfx1: Should be free for one character and 10-15 bucks for all others.
[6:33:58] KinggKebab: We can complain all we want, let’s be real, people are still gonna pay it
[6:34:00] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: $70 is a lot of money
[6:34:03] coldhandsbeatz: they defenitely want to stretch classic population to people that dont even want to play TBC classic
[6:34:07] seaperz: are we sure "per character" isn´t a reference for people with more accounts then 1?
[6:34:11] Wildside1177: Way too expensive.
[6:34:11] foxies_havocing: When is Dreamhaven revealing some games? :D
[6:34:20] joeyfontana: Wasn’t classic free?
[6:34:23] Miguel85NYC: should've been 50
[6:34:23] Jindo_ZG: @towelliee I'm straight up sending my main to Vanilla and boosting a new paladin for BC to avoid the price
[6:34:27] magakigr: it would worth it if only the pets and stuff transferred to retail.
[6:34:33] Eraste: yes chat but classic didnt come with extra stuff
[6:34:34] Sollice: TBC is also free
[6:34:34] Hitokiri83: if it was physical then sure it hink 60
[6:34:34] westgamez: 70$ is what i am happy to pay for TBC classic itself
[6:34:37] wreckshoptv: so we get a mount for retail and TBC?
[6:34:37] LucidAntics: chat this is for the 1 time boost and extra bells and whistles, BC is also free.
[6:34:38] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I'd pay $70 for a boost and a month of game time is fine by me. The toys are just extra.
[6:34:39] KriissGo: it's not fine dude wtf, games cost that much not items in game
[6:34:41] warrenny: Deluxe edition release with prepatch?
[6:34:43] janschuim: @Biorrwolf i don;t have one at 60 in classic but would like to have one and then also continue in TBC
[6:34:43] Waspire: if it was 35  per aCCOUNT.. not char  then i cwouldnt have a problem with it
[6:34:44] Exxcar: @joeyfontana base TBC is also free. Its only for a deluxe edition of TBC
[6:34:45] danny_way: agreed
[6:34:46] Sollice: You dont have to pay for TBC other than your WoW sub.
[6:34:46] Biorrwolf: "OmFg CoRpOrAtE gReEd!!!" *pays anyways*
[6:34:48] Eraste: believe it or not you DONT have to spend any money if youre already subbed
[6:34:53] t_800_i: yeah
[6:34:59] korn66: so you cant play tbc just for sub fee?

[6:35:02] Xerevil: i think people are mad about the fact that it's a re-release of a game...the price is too high tbh for something that's already been released
[6:35:04] TMMOOF: I do wish they remastered the graphics that would be sweet. I REALLY hope they do that for Wrath Classic
[6:35:06] illuminationpaladincurse: Yeah but i bought TBC box back in 2007
[6:35:10] alohaimadam: I dont get how people are mad at the price? Dont buy it?
[6:35:14] Sollice: Calm down
[6:35:28] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Was there one?
[6:35:28] wednesjae: wait there was a classic collectors edition?
[6:35:29] Eraste: danThis
[6:35:29] b0bcaygeon: when have you ever known blizzard to not overprice their sh*t
[6:35:29] Gingerprimer: You do not even have to buy the game
[6:35:30] Traxacon: the price isnt even that bad
[6:35:30] EthicalHermit: @Towelliee I usually get the bundles for the mounts/game time. The other stuff is just extra
[6:35:30] iblink22: was there a classic deluxe?
[6:35:33] Collected1: we need to mobilise and protest
[6:35:37] Collected1: its the only way they'll lsiten
[6:35:37] NovaSynth: I knew it was going to cost at least $70 for the Deluxe. You do get a lot of shit for that price.
[6:35:39] techdough: classic collectors?!
[6:35:46] LucidAntics: the only good comment in that entire thread :)
[6:35:47] Desanduin: Wasn't the physical classic CE $200?
[6:35:50] ThisIsAsabel: thing is people already have paid for the ORIGINAL deluxe edition back in the day, and it wasnt digital :D
[6:35:50] S1appadabass: Time is money
[6:35:52] JerBoody: @christofano You don’t have to pay anything extra for rereleased content it’s only if you want the stuffs
[6:35:52] fennecx25: why would any1 want to stay in classic? confused
[6:35:55] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Heck the mounts and toys are basically free.
[6:35:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they didnt have a classic collectors edition i thought
[6:35:58] fennecx25: what will you do there
[6:35:59] ColdIceCreamMan: prices are out
[6:36:00] iblink22: was there a classic collectors?
[6:36:00] uberhart: but how classic era servers will work, like will start everythink from phase 1?
[6:36:04] PlaguedV: so are there other editions or is it just the deluxe ?
[6:36:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: it was the 15 year anniversary box
[6:36:10] ChiefMango: oh yeah, does it say if all characters get this or only one?
[6:36:11] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: was $100
[6:36:11] Sincline387: that was 15th anniversery wasn't it
[6:36:15] iblink22: oh it was an anniversary edition
[6:36:17] Desanduin: @Towelliee Nope you were right, 99
[6:36:18] SlowpokeIsAGamer: No restart. Classic will stay in its current state forever (or until it gets so dead Blizz has to reset it)
[6:36:21] mavericks312: @mooncatthefox the original didnt come with 2 mounts
[6:36:26] Wildside1177: Pet - zero value, mount - zero value, expansion - was developed 13 years ago  - almost no cost today. But I expected Blizzard to charge a lot. Who didn't?
[6:36:43] blvdxoxo: value is subjective
[6:36:44] Biorrwolf: What? No Kil'Jaeden coming out of the Sunwell statue?
[6:36:57] SSJJoel: towBolvar
[6:37:02] mavericks312: @Wildside1177 2 mounts equals out to 50$
[6:37:02] Collected1: how does that compare to the deluxe retail

[6:37:08] Biorrwolf: @wildside1177 It's still not that much of a bonus incentive
[6:37:13] magakigr: make the extras share with retail and 70 is a good price
[6:37:16] b0bcaygeon: blizzard services are always overpriced

[6:37:27] shimwood: But if I don't get teh mount no one will think I'm cool and they won't want to raid with me
[6:37:29] K_A_N_J_I: @wildside1177 that statement is false it has no value to you but I know mount collectors in retail that would pay 70$ just for the mount. Value is different per person
[6:37:31] ThisIsAsabel: @mavericks312 so 70box for 2 store mounts that should be lootable in the game instead
[6:37:31] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I'll probably boost my druid I was using to farm ore for my JC.
[6:37:35] Holysal: thats what im doing. im not spending any money other than the sub
[6:37:40] illuminationpaladincurse: they should change the name of blizzard to money pigs or greed
[6:37:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: the deluxe edition could be $30 and people would still complain
[6:37:51] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: the 15 year wow anniversary collectors edition was $100 and had the ragnaros statue @Towelliee
[6:37:56] Sollice: @mooncatthefox Continue to die on that sword....It's going to change eventually!?!?!?!?!
[6:37:59] Phob0slol: I mean,if you are a retail player and u make some gold of boosting m+ or raids u just buy a char boost with 3 wow tokens @Towelliee
[6:38:02] WowItsFrostyLOL: Damn I should have been watching Asmongold so I could watch him blow a fuse with this information xD
[6:38:02] mavericks312: @mooncatthefox a month of game time and a character boost those 2 alone would be 55$
[6:38:04] cineris_3: I was thinking it would be 100+ dollars
[6:38:06] vseodishpogashti: best name for hunter is - Activison and naming ur pet Blizzard
[6:38:08] elbortu: Will there be new server or "old  server Tbc version" ? couse my server is completly dead
[6:38:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: mouse mat
[6:38:18] Sincline387: 25 dollar store mount, 40 dollar character boost, 15 dollar game times.  that's 80 right there.
[6:38:19] Yagr6: if i have a sub do i have to pay to own tbc? how does that work
[6:38:26] Wildside1177: @K_A_N_J_I Fair enough. I agree. Value is personal. For me, 0.
[6:38:27] Theduskflyer: TBC gold token when????
[6:38:28] blvdxoxo: @Raijuu88  no
[6:38:28] Desanduin: I'm using that mouse pad right now
[6:38:31] Biorrwolf: So if you buy the DE, do you get a mount per character since there's no Mount Collection tab? Or does it only go to that boosted character?
[6:38:33] SlowpokeIsAGamer: I laugh every time people think Character Services is "greed" when Gacha mechanics exist that are actually illegal in some countries.
[6:38:36] Mecabeast: so asmon basically just said release date likely decided to boost sub numbers for quarterly report
[6:38:37] Kinghorn: LETS GO
[6:38:38] coldhandsbeatz: they should give a free server tramsfer for people who play in dead servers
[6:38:43] Squirrel_nutty: Raijuu88  no its part of your sub
[6:38:45] Sincline387: @Raijuu88 TBC is free, the deluxe is just extra stuff
[6:38:51] Sollice: @K_A_N_J_I It's a video game NONE of it holds value lol
[6:39:08] Just_Jaybles: so  when is pre pacth?
[6:39:12] dsoteryy: not true
[6:39:12] dreamjag: char boost 40 is not bad
[6:39:15] Holysal: 18th
[6:39:17] Cranghoul: 18th
[6:39:19] dsoteryy: you can sell gold for real money
[6:39:19] ThisIsAsabel: @mavericks312 yes, charater boost are insanely high priced -besides being stupid for the game- , and you already pay the sub for classic or retail anyway, there is virtually no reason to pay one again
[6:39:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 5Head ceos
[6:39:21] dreamjag: i was expecting 60
[6:39:25] Biorrwolf: @sollice the value of holds depends on how much of your life you're willing to invest. So any value is subjective
[6:39:38] Sollice: June TBC, July 9.1, August DI,
[6:39:40] Burntlettuce: Yup and tjen d2 in October or November and they got releases in all quarters
[6:39:44] MrKray2: 9.1 confirmed?
[6:39:46] Sollice: then what, maybe 9.2 end of year?
[6:39:55] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Whats the big Q4 payday then
[6:39:58] othraerir: oh o
[6:40:04] Exxcar: I doubt 9.2 would be this year
[6:40:05] Rudric_Ice: asmon couldn't take it anymore so now hes online LUL
[6:40:07] Sollice: D2 Remastered is Holiday 2021 for sure
[6:40:07] Holysal: @Sollice thats 2022
[6:40:09] Mecabeast: kinda scummy but business is business
[6:40:10] mavericks312: @Sollice either december or january

[6:41:32] TheDarkerClouds: @Towelliee What are your thoughts on the population on the current Classic servers once TBC launches?
[6:41:34] mavericks312: @Raijuu88 no you can get the boost itself for 40$
[6:41:40] mmrghost7: i am just worried i wont be able to level up my ally shaman intime
[6:41:41] ToadyMcToadFace: Towel how are you not driving yourself crazy sitting at level 59, get to blasting my man
[6:41:49] blvdxoxo: @Raijuu88 no you can buy the boost separately
[6:41:50] rocthenite: asmon said the game is not ready from what he played on the beta
[6:41:52] Biorrwolf: @sollice Ngl, some meatloaf would SLAP right now
[6:41:57] Sollice: lol
[6:42:05] Collected1: fuck that guy
[6:42:09] nightmayor12: Meatloaf crunch
[6:42:12] dinomiyte: why do people bitch about shit like that. if you dont wanna play/buy stfu and dont play/buy. let the people who wants to play, play
[6:42:20] CyonDru: I just think its dumb to have a release date for the expac, but no release date for pre patch
[6:42:29] shimwood: @Sollice I would do anything for Blizz, but I won't do that
[6:42:35] JerBoody: Haha people that complain about prices that then pay them anyways is like throwing food at raccoons in your trash bin to try and chase them away
[6:42:43] nightmayor12: @Jaybruvx there literally is a date lmao
[6:42:46] Sollice: @Sollice I get the reference lol

[6:48:54] FlyLikeAnAngel: I wish
[6:48:56] WowItsFrostyLOL: @towelliee genuine question is it a loud minority of people that hate wow, or do you think wow really is losing favor with its player base?
[6:48:56] jontrann: #DROPPREPATCHNOW
[6:48:59] Cartharon: i am gonna lvl a space goat, don't know if i can hit 60 till launch, but i am still hyped as fuck
[6:49:00] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Heck it servers down in 3 hours for prepatch
[6:49:00] maddogbg27: FUCK ME
[6:49:01] Exxcar: @Towelliee will it be faster to level once pre-patch is out?
[6:49:03] Funderik: they still snap shotting most likely.
[6:49:03] MiddlePhaze: who wants to play with those weird talents stuck at 60
[6:49:07] Just_Jaybles: WTF

[6:49:14] Rudric_Ice: SHOuld be fucking free
[6:49:16] coldhandsbeatz: Im sure they have the ability to enable prepatch tomorrow. I hope they see the outcry and do it
[6:49:18] Yagr6: alt friendly LUL
[6:49:19] Phalamore: There will be no point to clone though because those servers will be so dead
[6:49:24] Rudric_Ice: or $10
[6:49:25] raymond3195: I see prepatch on 11
[6:49:26] BlueBeast33: Just saw the news, what is this stupid bullshit, 2 weeks?
[6:49:37] cineris_3: that price is almost meant to be a deterrent
[6:49:37] Eraste: i sure as heck wasnt ever planning on it
[6:49:38] toxicmammoth: @towelliee I'm not super informed in the wow game cycle, but why is 14 days of prepatch too short?
[6:49:39] Templexx: i dont know any1 cloning tbh
[6:49:41] buddybeerbruh: nah its just Blizzard milking as usual @Towelliee
[6:49:50] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Yeah I think Blizz's poll results probably said most players will go either ONLY Vanilla or ONLY BC.
[6:49:54] Bruhnders: no fresh start servers...
[6:49:57] faulen: At this point, I don't know what a clone does and I'm too afraid to ask.  :7
[6:49:57] khronick1904: wait only 14 days of pre patch?
[6:49:58] maddogbg27: @Towelliee Yea that is insane for 35 per char, i am still on fence if i will play TBC, it was my  favorite expansion so i am really temped but i doubt i will have time for live and BC
