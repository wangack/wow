[1:19:54] Kyusinx: Also I want to say I enjoy this much more than the ol' classic Batleground grind
[1:20:20] jammathehammer: Hi swifty do you think feral is good for classic hc?
[1:20:21] otownraiders: I feel the HC challenged has humbled a lot of people. Mostly being the ones  who have called the game boring for years but never really played the game in it’s original form, or have had to grind for stuff
[1:20:26] ataturk1907: whats the elite profile frame addon?

[1:21:30] essadis: even a DPS can cause a wipe. everyone just got to accept it can happen
[1:21:37] ComradeWarners: It’s so interesting since the game isn’t designed for this, so it really is a challenge

[1:24:03] cunningstunt61: no way
[1:24:03] avenomxx: they wouldnt
[1:24:05] Gorgok_tv: no shot
[1:24:05] zfrzz: how to u have the elite frame?
[1:24:05] HealsAndThrills: well if it's official, Im sure they can get banned for griefing maybe?
[1:24:06] RaptorAurion: no way blizzard can check that many cases i think
[1:24:07] knivencs: doubt it
[1:24:11] xmedpakx: no chance for appeals on live servbers
[1:24:14] saevenar: Griefing is bannable.
[1:24:14] kaaruumii: no way
[1:24:18] ComradeWarners: I think they would probably make it so that pvp wasn’t even possible
[1:24:19] Miikle: Nah they will not
[1:24:20] Martylang: no appeals but I think they will minimize trolling like  short leashes on most mobs
[1:24:20] 7thSaga: as Ivan Drago said ''if he dies he dies'' no appeals for hardcore servers O_o
[1:24:24] Simple_Chops: as long as they don't allow transfers, let it be the wild west
[1:24:25] imraduin: on a HC realm even the greifers would be HC, so they take a risk as well at least
[1:24:26] butcherxh: pay to rez
[1:24:27] ughsmash: well everyone on the server will be hardcore atleast
[1:24:27] jimbob93: they dont even reply to tickets now
[1:24:28] Javansi: they should hire like the whole hc discord team to just continue paid
[1:24:29] fabiandoom: W Current support hell no
[1:24:30] Carptwitch: Nope
[1:24:32] Ranexi: Yes, they will. For a "Scroll of Redemption", only 50% including 900% discount @Swifty
[1:24:37] Kyusinx: They're not going to pay someone 80k/yr to revive people. Maybe 2010 Blizz would have :(
[1:24:38] Pups_Gersky: If they did, then it would only be for streamers.
[1:24:38] fabiandoom: with the current customer support? hell no lol
[1:24:39] wizardspam: What if everyone on the server is hardcore
[1:24:39] knivencs: @Comrade_Warners not only way of griefing
[1:24:40] Ranexi: 50$ *
[1:24:41] Plioscu: can you show your weapon
[1:24:42] hapstream: TOS needs to be amended and griefing defined.
[1:24:42] buffmonkey123: @7thSaga yep..........
[1:24:50] loken88: FYI the elite lost the mark, just saw him on stream :)
[1:24:57] zimtheglobal: blizzard gonna charge us 30$ fors a rez
[1:24:58] back2r00ts: D:
[1:25:04] BravoSector: 30$ ress
[1:25:05] knoxipoo: thats part of the fun
[1:25:09] Javansi: they could hire like the whole hc discord team to just continue their work
[1:25:14] 7thSaga: LUL that would be hilarious
[1:25:16] avenomxx: or hire a bodyguard
[1:25:24] farrendad: npc voiceover addon?

[1:25:27] kaaruumii: its blizzard soooo
[1:25:27] Frankthetank819: Yes worth it
[1:25:28] buffmonkey123: there's no way they're going to do that. There's just no way. No way. No way.
[1:25:29] surian456: buy you char back to life for only 69 dollar
[1:25:29] Javansi: no shot
[1:25:31] Kyusinx: They would not
[1:25:31] BravoSector: is activision we talking about
[1:25:31] zfrzz: of course
[1:25:32] knivencs: aint no chance they do that
[1:25:34] Kyusinx: maybe Nexon or something
[1:25:35] Frankthetank819: LUL
[1:25:37] otownraiders: No Blizzard won’t, it will be tough to do, but then there are people who file fake claims so tough to figure out
[1:25:39] LillaJeon: Don't give them ideas
[1:25:41] ignotious: They don’t do that for D3
[1:25:41] kimjongcouille: I feel like official hardcore server will take so long to be up that the hype will have died down
[1:25:51] killsigil: @7thSaga great game, 7thsaga
[1:26:09] BravoSector: no
[1:26:12] Martylang: no your ded
[1:26:13] ignotious: Nah
[1:26:15] jammathehammer: hi guys im new is feral druid good for classic HC?
[1:26:20] Frankthetank819: Ofc not
[1:26:21] surian456: No, there are no appeals in diablo
[1:26:21] ignotious: That’s the risk
[1:26:21] PopeJonas: no
[1:26:26] Kyusinx: People can hate on Blizz but they remain the least P2W/Fomo online game company
[1:26:26] hapstream: No, it’s too much. The load would be too heavy.
[1:26:38] raldrik: Blizz can fix it by just making deaths to guards not count
[1:26:39] Hebertongolongo: Acording to the HC rules, can you trade with your partner if you are in a duo?
[1:26:39] essadis: they just need to do what Diablo does and put a straight up disclosure.  "Abandon all hope all ye who enter"
[1:26:50] mickecharm: i want to play wotlk, how many play wotlk compared to retail?
[1:26:53] Koukebg: yea
[1:26:58] RollerRat: Level 60 character boost $59.95
[1:26:58] BravoSector: I think theyre gonna do season of mastery 2.0 with hardcore. everything normal but you cant die
[1:26:59] Koukebg: those crypst have hyper spawn
[1:27:02] essadis: @Hebertongolongo yes
[1:27:02] otownraiders: @jammathehammer all depends, it’s what you want to play
[1:27:21] Hebertongolongo: @essadis ty
[1:27:26] hapstream: Imagine hiring griefers to take out other guilds for world bosses.
[1:27:28] Koukebg: @mickecharm Im playing it rn just hitting level 40, leveling is a blast, theres tons of ppl on the populated servers if thats your thing
[1:27:34] essadis: trolls will die too tho. adn they will start to understand lol
[1:27:47] Gorgok_tv: yeah and as a lvl 60 you can easily grief lvl 30-20 w/o anyrisk of dying.
[1:27:51] ComradeWarners: I could see them disable a lot of the things that cause griefing, like for example in original vanilla they made Lord Kazzak not able to be kited, and I feel like they could just disable pvp outright
[1:28:10] 7thSaga: what if this version of Hardcore now is just a test the real hardcore players will be on the blizzard one Keepo
[1:28:18] Dimichsky: they could aslo do that when there is a mob tagged by someone else it does no damage to you with aoes
[1:28:20] Martylang: or pally bubble  or feign death hunter
[1:28:26] mackrey_: you dont need pvp to grief

[1:29:07] mixtik123: It's real simple. Blizz will suspend grifers accounts for a few days

[1:29:14] Inluk: so glad to see you back and enjoying the game
[1:29:15] Hebertongolongo: If blizzard disables all the mechanics that causes griefting, HC streams and video compilations will be less entertaining.

[4:45:38] orgnalf: you can go skinning and LW for druid and just make your own gear
[4:45:40] butcherxh: next time you make a tauren name it RopaVieja
[4:45:41] alantin77: miner can smelt
[4:45:41] ezscaping: if ur gonna vendor isnt lskinning and leatherworking better?
[4:45:41] zawos_zawer: need money for knife
[4:45:41] GGNightShadeGG: Alch is nice for pots too.
[4:45:42] FilthyCasualNA: ore you can get gems too cant you?
[4:45:47] SlyceAsNyce: ores i'd say
[4:45:49] Dissuxx: Ores probably better but herbs is 1 cast and done
[4:46:06] ezscaping: gathering is better if u have AH but u dont
[4:46:18] turox90: Skinner - LW , swap LW to enchanter to DE the items you made as enchanter , and enchant youself xD

[4:46:39] killvaine05: @Roscoe426 no it does not
[4:46:54] raver31: i would do anything for a wand on my priest
[4:46:55] alantin77: don't enchant until lvl 60 if you want to do that
[4:46:57] ezscaping: youd have to re level the profs screw that
[4:46:57] AussieDave1980: @FilthyCasualNA classic gems yes, not jewels because that was LK
[4:47:03] alantin77: since trading at lvl 60
[4:47:18] desiggns: @Swifty  Doesnt metter u could to not think about it - but We Lost a moment.
[4:47:29] yandiz: herb + alchemy for surv or mining+eng for target dummy
[4:47:30] Dissuxx: I'd say just skinning/LW and craft yourself gear.. or do tailoring to make bags etc
[4:47:37] zanden1: do you have any lvl 60??
[4:47:47] CriticalDroog: this area is one of the best in the game

[4:48:00] orgnalf: my shaman went down like cdew. i had my professions in a good spot i had my first aid in a good spot and i died in the barens at 13 to centars respawning
[4:48:05] Klameros: Leatherworking does not make bags?
[4:48:06] AussieDave1980: skinning or tailoring, they have natural progression to vendoring
[4:48:12] northern_druid: druid is one of the best leverlers, big toolbox and little gear dependent
[4:48:12] Cowardpatty: John, watch this off stream to get some tips on druid - https://youtu.be/UNHSOBkCYBk?t=459
[4:48:13] turox90: skinner + tailoring mby? since you pick up so much cloth along the way to make your bags
[4:48:16] turox90: you also need leather so
[4:48:18] Sacredspir1t: tauren are my fav race and mulgore best starting zone
[4:48:21] turox90: its an ok combo for that
[4:48:27] Notropolis: Nooooo you died?
[4:48:44] k24fur: @Swifty  can you rub your head and tap your tummy at the same time?
[4:48:47] saddlebagsTwitch: yeah thats the goal till you get to 60 and change your mind.
[4:48:49] Jeilyn7: with lvl 30 yes
[4:48:55] northern_druid: its the nerfed wf remember, not the good old OP one
[4:49:00] orgnalf: shamans are also pretty tanky and can heal themself
