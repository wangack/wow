[0:34:21] FrankTheTank1988: i think its gonna be fun imo
[0:34:21] Daemoos6: Wait for it to be free on Epic Kappa
[0:34:27] Ertra: lol what....   this is a pokemon ripoff
[0:34:43] ermymunster: Craftopia and the other two are just like a card battler and a party game
[0:34:44] Khadgarlic: Ive heard SoD phase 2 is coming soon Kappa
[0:34:45] MadEquinox: Any thought's on Enshrouded, due to come out end of January.

[0:35:53] Daemoos6: Maybe they published without being the dev
[0:36:03] FrankTheTank1988: the palworld community manager(s) got swamped in early acess key requests for creators and the emargo released today. So imo i think its gonna be fairly popular.
[0:36:05] SaintTheFirst: oh nie
[0:36:10] Ertra: wow it looks really nice too
[0:36:14] Topele91: oooohhh prince of persia PARKOUR!
[0:36:20] FrankTheTank1988: provided multiplayer runs smoothly luxthoKEK otherwise ppl gonna be mad.
[0:37:03] ermymunster: So it's Valheim on crack kinda?
[0:37:06] Sarocus: Early access
[0:37:11] Ertra: thats next tuesday isn't it?
[0:37:12] xluckydawgx: no its early acces
[0:37:20] xluckydawgx: Wed @Ertra
[0:37:38] Ertra: @xluckydawgx lol i was close
[0:37:43] FrankTheTank1988: most games nowadays release into EA first, as there is so many things a dev can take advantage off in there imo. D:
[0:38:01] xluckydawgx: @xluckydawgx Only reason I know is because I have my surgery on the 23rd and thats a tuesday KEKW
[0:38:16] Sarocus: Same
[0:38:24] FrankTheTank1988: if Enshrouded devs add a option for RNG generated Map its gonna be a big win. :D
[0:38:28] ermymunster: @FrankTheTank1988 I don't mind the idea of early access, I'm just nervous about those games that NEVER come out of EA and just keep taking people's money (cough cough Star Citizen cough cough)
[0:38:40] Angryfist40: i was going to play the demo but they took it away :p
[0:38:46] FrankTheTank1988: @ermymunster yeah some stay in EA forever D:

[0:39:23] ermymunster: @FrankTheTank1988 Of all the EA games I've purchased, only ONE was abandoned before full release, and that was cause their publisher backed out last minute

[1:26:15] Nebulizer87: i still think they need to put more time/investment into crafting
[1:26:20] biirrd: but you auto as hunter is crap
[1:26:26] Nebulizer87: all gatherings should be minigames etc
[1:26:37] theToxi_: I honestly wish the crafting orders were more social.. meaning you actually have to meet another player in the world and do a "crafting trade" or so
[1:27:12] theToxi_: I also loved how Lineage II had people open their shops
[1:27:42] Ckraigfriend: have a brh for the vers mastery neck
[1:28:25] theToxi_: Right now it's just a secondary AH
[1:28:30] ahux_: @theToxi_ that sounds awful
[1:28:32] theToxi_: People are already constantly in menus
[1:28:36] captainboosted: i dont understand why they cant be made and out on ah
[1:28:47] Mibb: aint nobody got time for that
[1:29:18] mentosz09: I would like a free handy with my purchase!
[1:29:18] theToxi_: Yeah but imagine a gigachad crafter having good reputation being constantly surrounded by people in Valdrakken
[1:29:23] neverbornlucky: hi lux heard you wanted to meet me
[1:29:54] Tinit5190: That would make sense Lux... they don't do that
[1:29:58] Mallaes: Not going to happen
[1:30:03] biirrd: yes.. and same when you upgrade
[1:30:06] mentosz09: Just the tip? But if we meet up it might be more than just the tip

[1:31:15] captainboosted: are you raiding again are just doing mythic pluses?
[1:31:17] Tinit5190: I made all my alts able to use a LW to craft, so I just made my own LW and can make stuff for my own characters.
[1:31:28] ladywulfen: Steve in Narnia LUL
[1:31:30] Tinit5190: And have 1 enchanter for the crafting mats
[1:31:31] Julia: the Ravendawn game director uses your WAs danJulia your work has no limits
[1:31:45] Tinit5190: All my alts are either Leather or Mail wearers only lol
[1:31:45] Julia: yea xD
[1:31:54] theToxi_: In Lineage 2 crafters were a separate class you had to level, and a lot of items were craft-only, so people would set up shops in the big cities and after quite some time you even knew the spots that the good crafters were sitting in.. Was cool af :P Ofc not as convenient as just an insta-buy AH menu
[1:32:30] ermymunster: What'd you call it? Lion-Age 2?
[1:32:35] FrankTheTank1988: @Luxthos  what i had for dinner, altho with a diffrent sauce. luxthoNom  https://sailingselkie.no/fried-norwegian-cod-roe-creamy-mustard-sauce-pickled-carrots.html

[1:34:32] mentosz09: I just want actual visuals for my crafting not just clicking a button kinda like in FF
[1:34:36] Julia: unless delves change the balance of everything, and they realize they can make other stuff too
[1:34:37] Aggy: I just want to interract with my pocket friends, not some fucking randos
[1:34:41] ahux_: before there was no comparison so it worked for WoW

[1:35:29] Effin_Steffin: i kinda.. miss the old crafting/prof leveling
[1:35:31] theToxi_: I'm having high hopes for the Riot MMO, but all it's focus is definitely gonna be on MTX & Battlepass stuff 1005
[1:35:34] theToxi_: 100% *
[1:35:51] Julia: dont hold your breath for it danJulia

[1:42:45] KingNothing11: I wonder if there is an addon that creates a list of mobs you are in aggro with, and then aligns them so you can easily target when camera angle is an issue.
[1:43:28] KingNothing11: (a list that you can select to target)
[1:43:33] Ertra: wait you can cast through turtle now?
[1:44:04] Sam_M_K: I prefer Survival because you actually fight WITH your pet as opposed to not having a pet or using pets to fight.
[1:44:11] SaintTheFirst: FFXIV aggro list, tottally needs to be an addon. lol

[7:29:03] Stitorex: I dont like DnD for frost. It doesnt fit thematically and feels bad rotationally
[7:29:27] Topele91: @notpadfoot pala, monk
[7:29:29] notpadfoot: Same as rain of fire and earthquake omg lol
[7:29:39] Stitorex: @Topele91 Monk? lol
[7:29:40] notpadfoot: @Topele91 monk is modern?!
[7:29:48] Stitorex: are you still playing mists?
[7:30:05] AxeOlotolz: i prefer playing breath over oblit
[7:30:11] Stitorex: Up to date would be pally/rogue imo
[7:30:32] notpadfoot: I agree! I like what they did with the rework
[7:30:36] Darkside1366: i cant figure out my ret ST dps i do wayy way more aoe st feels bad
[7:30:39] Topele91: @notpadfoot as main one i dont think it have less for something, good defensives, nices interrupts, tank gameplay is rough, but u can handle it
[7:31:04] notpadfoot: @Topele91 I main a mw too! It has good things, but idk if I can call it modern.
[7:31:33] AxeOlotolz: i want SL demo back
[7:31:39] AxeOlotolz: make tyrant actually mean something
[7:31:45] AxeOlotolz: and be a 1 minute cd
[7:31:55] brisko_gaming: I’m looking for an alt to mess around with when I’m done with my vault on my ret pally, nothing seems to be filling it
[7:32:15] beldemort25: I would love to see you play a Havoc DH
[7:32:51] Megacheetah: I dislike dancing to do my damage on Havoc
[7:32:57] Topele91: @notpadfoot id like the gameplay, maybe thats why i called modern hehe
[7:33:04] Stitorex: DK is in need of a rework soon
[7:33:38] beldemort25: Fair enought champ!
[7:33:55] Stitorex: I hope warr/dk get revamps next.
[7:33:56] StreamElements:  Enjoying the stream? Considering subscribing to support: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/luxthos
[7:34:29] AxeOlotolz: lock capstones feel bad
[7:34:34] beldemort25: But my first ever main was a Frost DK. And i really hope they do something with it soon
[7:34:51] AxeOlotolz: naked tyrant feels weird
[7:34:51] Stitorex: Blood is the only fun DK spec at the moment
[7:35:04] Megacheetah: I think I realize what happened with DK
[7:35:13] Megacheetah: Cause they had something good going for them in Legion
[7:35:25] Stitorex: Unholy was tuned around PI and frost hasnt been good since bfa with insane stats
[7:36:03] AxeOlotolz: S4 breath build in SL cranked
[7:36:08] Stitorex: Fuck breath
[7:36:15] Stitorex: Thats the least fun gameplay the game has to offer

[7:36:27] Stitorex: Pop all CDs, Oh hey have a mechanic and be useless for 2 minutes.
[7:36:29] AxeOlotolz: all the damage for demo comes from tier
[7:36:39] brisko_gaming: think I may try out feral soon
[7:36:41] AxeOlotolz: once we lose that its a massive rip
[7:36:58] Stitorex: I mean, thats the point of borrowed power.
[7:37:19] Stitorex: I think its because of how boring S1 tier was
[7:37:27] side_eff3cts: whats the DH tier bonus?
[7:38:09] Stitorex: 3-5 target consistent cleave with frost is a blast.
[7:38:30] PaganReaper93: !gamble all
