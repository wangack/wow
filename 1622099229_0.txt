[0:10:06] Moobot: @warrenny it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 10:11 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon™
[0:12:28] Aervyper: so everyone got hope for dragonflight?
[0:13:07] warrenny: @aervyper The beta seems great not much to fuck up imo
[0:13:41] warrenny: Can we still do m+ im beta or is that iver?
[0:13:49] Aervyper: i remember being so hyped for torghast... Literally one week in i wanted to burn the game
[0:14:36] warrenny: Wow players are so dramatic
[0:15:44] Nehcrom: I had fun in the beginning of shadowlands but then it turned stale. Always look forward to a new expansions, been playing wow for so long I know what I get :)
[0:16:31] Nehcrom: Hopefully they are taking more chances and not playing it so safe this time around. Sure some will be great some will be meh and some will be ok.
[0:16:55] warrenny: @nehcrom I had fun throughout tbh 9.1 was kinda meh but still my second fav expac
[0:17:04] Aervyper: i gave up tbh. Just found wow isn't for me. Thought that lost ark and New world was the new awesome and yea.... done with MMO's. I might try LOL MMO but i might be 70 when that comes out
[0:17:18] Thoreya: blizz bring back beta reee, i dont wanna log into retail
[0:17:53] Nehcrom: Legion is still hands down my favorite expansion of the later years. Had most fun in BFA though since I raided again hadn't done that since BC.
[0:18:17] warrenny: @nehcrom Agreed
[0:18:40] warrenny: Legion then sl then bfa maybe wrath mop cata wod imo
[0:19:21] Nehcrom: I have a hard time ranking the earlier wow expansions since it is mostly nostalgia. Now with classic I have had the chance to play it again.. Not so much fun anymore :P
[0:20:23] Nehcrom: I am looking forward to DF being more alt friendly. Alts is what is keeping me playing through out the expansions :)
[0:21:19] punkius: reluctant to play after the farce that sl was...
[0:21:42] Nehcrom: Let your wallet do the talking then!
[0:22:10] Nehcrom: I have been doing 6 months subs since years back because I know I will always play wow until it dies (or I die :P).
[0:22:10] punkius: haha
[0:23:52] warrenny: # @nehcrom the new renown system is mostly acco7nt wide right as is dragon riding?
[0:24:07] Nehcrom: As I understand it yes.

[1:24:01] BirdieXL: dire beast is a haste increase
[1:24:01] Connectus: Temp summon

[1:25:25] CatfishTrout: That Arcane Surge change is basically a 2% nerf to the ability
[1:25:27] jo3mazing: So stick with fire?
[1:26:14] mavericks312: @jo3mazing fire or frost really
[1:26:17] AintEvenFlexin: sad that they hit arcane. in raidtesting fire was still destroying arcane and now spec is just doomed
[1:26:32] jo3mazing: @mavericks312 ty
[1:26:47] jo3mazing: @AintEvenFlexin ty
[1:26:50] mavericks312: fire and frost are still the best specs
[1:27:08] mavericks312: @jo3mazing ppl dont like frost this xpac cause its more ice lance spamming
[1:27:40] AintEvenFlexin: @mavericks312 people loved frost in legion doe and legion was also ice lance spam
[1:27:57] captiv8: Yeah but isn’t most of that the enchants and potions?
[1:27:57] Cosmolus: rip divin3 storm
[1:27:58] abracka_: shockadin back on the menu
[1:28:08] mayonaes: I am still torn between Monk and DH
[1:28:15] CatfishTrout: I heard Preheat say that Arcane was actually doing a lot more than frost & fire, so I'm not sure that we know how it will shake out yet
[1:28:28] Sanctana827: They did more nerfs to paladins thats not on that list
[1:28:34] AintEvenFlexin: in dungeons doe not raid
[1:28:41] Sanctana827: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dragonflight-pre-expansion-ptr-development-notes/1330092/7
[1:28:51] jo3mazing: I am just getting back into WoW just wondering what dps spec to go with.
[1:29:22] UnsweetTeaGang: That is a big deal haha. Gonna affect the mythic groups for sure
[1:29:23] AintEvenFlexin: @jo3mazing dont pick yet wait for all the bugs 2 be fixed and maybe even wait for prepatch and try some  stuff
[1:29:26] CatfishTrout: @jo3mazing Just play what's fun - they're going to be tuning all xpac, and you'll have to switch over & over if you try to follow whatever is best.
[1:29:42] Yagr6: Enhance getting so much more love than ele its insane
[1:29:46] jo3mazing: Good advice thanks guys
[1:30:26] 91Niki: I wasn't trying to be funny when I tell people "A 100 class changes can happen between now and release", when y'all ask "what's the best tank/dps/healer to play for df" LUL
[1:30:35] CatfishTrout: They Goldilocks'd it
[1:30:40] Einherjarthule: enh love they fix bugs wtf
[1:30:47] KingSpud91: so prot warrior getting buffs ... LUL

[1:32:32] SherriJade: BM is wild in beta.

[1:33:09] mayonaes: lol
[1:33:50] SherriJade: LOL they already do like.. over 100k dps aoe..
[1:33:50] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[1:34:06] thebakeriscomingforu: The tuning makes sense but the bear tanks have so little going on in their talent tree.
[1:34:23] SherriJade: that's insane xD I promised I'd switch to devastation for my raid team cause we didn't have anyone maining it.. I want my bm hunter back xD lol
[1:34:28] mayonaes: @SherriJade Sorry, they got buffed in pvp
[1:34:38] SherriJade: ok lol
[1:35:06] Strouss: damm taht means i have to rethink divcine toll for prot.
[1:35:06] Xerbear: Bear doesn't have anything atm. And the talent node that is shared with Ursoc's is also bad
[1:35:07] mayonaes: I am guessing BM still has not gotten their PVE tuning pass yet
[1:35:20] flebbooo: NotLikeThis

[1:37:40] Remmah_D: does BoS count as a negative periodic effect?
[1:38:01] 91Niki: Hey it could be worse. You could be a feral druid and only be good at the end of an expansion KEKW
[1:38:25] Cosmolus: we got nerfed more than +70% across the board. the tier piece gives us back 20% of what was there. So we got nerfed 50% minimum
[1:38:33] valkari317: Hey @Towelliee How the f are you doing my friend?
[1:38:39] valkari317: Havent seen you in a long time
[1:38:45] Einherjarthule: if you played ret on beta  you know this nerf are justified
[1:39:03] Cosmolus: Bullshit
[1:39:06] ArcaneSyntax: I mean ret was doing giga dam in the beta, so nerfs warranted.
[1:39:10] Cosmolus: We didn't need a nerf Kappa
[1:39:27] Einherjarthule: sure dreamer
[1:40:26] 91Niki: Mid testing KEKW WOW
[1:40:37] Cosmolus: God forbid that wheelchairs can have a bit of fun
[1:40:48] looney199725: ret deserved the nerfs otherwise it would be s3 sl all over again your tier set was like 60% of your dmg
[1:40:49] ArcaneSyntax: ret had to be nerf to properly test raids

[3:36:15] conv3rge_: With best buy discounts, I couldn't resist and snatched up a 4090 this morning
[3:36:21] CanadianCataclysm: My motherboard crapped out the other day. So i just built a new computer and got a new mobo where i gave that other comp to the wife.. and it has a 1060 gpu 6 gig as well.
[3:36:23] bigcountry555: my hamster is still alive and running on my video cards wheel just fine

[3:37:58] GamingDad77: @MilesKG21 ot just bolt it to the side of your current case with a riser cable..lol
[3:38:02] AllenzoTV: facts
[3:38:06] TheBroCrow: My 1660ti still bangs, only lack of raytracing is an issue

[3:39:18] Pufendorf99: @AllenzoTV same here, most stuff works just fine

[4:13:14] Glynn11: @Malkomod that's true. I still feel like a jalepeno or something from the farmers market will peel my face off while I can put down any ghost pepper hot sauce, etc
[4:13:15] Shrenko: what did they change with warmode ?

[4:18:04] Mecabeast: I got camped for 3hrs in Barrens while leveling a new toon on retail night elf mage that would go invis after killing then one shot you when you spawned back in
[4:18:24] gritbarontv: ay form of harassment, will get you ban
[4:18:28] Namtarts_TV: you just turn off pvp mode
[4:18:29] mozavich: it's not against the rules to camp people

[4:20:38] Jango_: i personally do not grief, but if I were being griefed on a PVP server I would be man enough to admit its my own fault for playing on a PVP server.

[4:21:11] im_n0t_jezus: good they have to cut out the toxic asshats
[4:21:33] 91Niki: @mmmone I feel like it depends on context. If you're being toxic towards someone, it's something else. General cussing is whatever
[4:21:49] the_bad_goat: Kids that report the words fuck or bitch are the ones that need trigger warnings before they step foot outside of their homes everyday

[4:23:59] TacoTime_Gaming: terrible cash shop

[4:25:45] c0mmander_starscream: I didnt card swipe Lost Ark
[4:25:55] Malkomod: Can you have a good experience in lost ark WITHOUT spending any money or its preferable spending a certain amount?
[4:26:02] SpoonManes: if it is it totally is stealing your personal data
[4:26:04] Lupine_Fury: gotta kill the guys around him

[4:27:25] Namtarts_TV: its not just shoulder shrugs
[4:27:30] abracka_: "muh personal data" it's already all out there, just be safe with putting CC/debit card information into sus sites, lean on paypal and have good system security/common sense security
[4:27:38] TompsonX: Lost Ark is probably my favourite game in quite a while, while you can certainly play it without spending you'll be no lifing it to keep up, if you treat it like a WoW membership pricing you'll be much better off
[4:27:52] 91Niki: yeah you can't play OW2 with pre paid cards

[4:49:23] TompsonX: So what you're saying is us casual need to focus on crafting
[4:49:39] TombStoneMercenary: Sour Cream and Onion Pringles are God Tier!!!
[4:49:39] SilkeySmooth: buy that wow token to tip that crafter
[4:49:40] Yagr6: 10 mil per item
[4:49:42] Coffenatic: Yo! What's up Towelliee and chat
[4:50:01] BlewGamingGroup: show me the $$$$

[4:50:23] nesman27: gold cap for a chest piece Kappa
[4:50:43] Coffenatic: @nesman27 or 3D mount
[4:50:46] Mecabeast: money little man put that shit in my hand if you don't you owe me owe me owe
[4:50:52] SilkeySmooth: buy the wow token with real money and buy raid gear
[4:50:54] Shurn_82: 55/hr done
[4:51:13] pk99: That RMT tho?
[4:51:20] TompsonX: That's RMT yeah
[4:51:21] Shurn_82: oh not Electrical foreman rate ... shit
[4:51:22] Sayryn: In gold
[4:51:35] KyleEverett: Well the raiders have to get the primal chaos on their own
[4:51:40] Murderingz: PEACE
[4:51:46] LearnedSomething: nope
[4:51:52] LearnedSomething: the escort is hanging upside down
[4:51:55] LearnedSomething: left side of cave
[4:51:55] Shurn_82: other one

[4:52:08] Shurn_82: right hand cage
[4:52:20] Featherbow: only one person can do the escort at a time
[4:52:33] gritbarontv: he got mobbed
[4:52:35] gritbarontv: lol
[4:52:41] Shurn_82: that cage, you out ranged him i think
[4:52:42] Redbearded16: @towelliee I was pretty casual during Sofo and I basically just became my guilds slut who would try to grab some sloppy seconds after farming for them. Voluntarily too, less energy to do that route when life gets in the way
[4:52:45] Shurn_82: oh
[4:52:50] KyleEverett: It will be interesting to see how hard it is to get enough mats to get stuff crafted. A +10 gives 4 primals on beta
[4:53:20] Yagr6: @Towelliee ive been playing chivalry 2 during this end of expansion downtime , its a mindless blast
[4:53:34] gritbarontv: follow
[4:53:41] Shurn_82: @Yagr6 its a great game, was on it last night!
[4:54:09] byrdeen45: undecember isnt a good game
[4:54:33] KyleEverett: no, normal ilvl crafted gear is just skill and specializations
[4:54:34] rbgdev: How is that not RMT if they paid them?
[4:54:36] gritbarontv: is because you can pay money?
[4:54:37] KyleEverett: Heroic and mythic take drops
[4:54:43] TompsonX: Surprised Pikachu Face
[4:54:54] byrdeen45: yes
[4:54:55] LearnedSomething: yeah
[4:55:03] LearnedSomething: it's really bad
[4:55:05] Rudric_Ice: people will raid more this expansion
[4:55:24] SembianTV: @Towelliee doesnt wow dooo.... exactly that with boosting and wow tokens?

[4:55:26] Tanaros: During MoP and WoD I was burned out on raiding so just did mat farming for the guild. They were supposed to carry me in exchange but never did
[4:55:33] KyleEverett: Watch the raid be super easy to be cleared within a reset
[4:55:40] Shurn_82: BEST steam review so far  "hyped -> installed -> looked @ shop -> used calc -> laughed -> uninstalled -> surprised the uninstall was free "
[4:55:46] mrz_as: OMEGALUL
[4:55:49] Folgrum: ppl who dont like raiding will just not buy expansion
[4:55:50] LearnedSomething: SembianTV wow bans boosters who sell for money
[4:55:50] xxsargexx: its confirmed oct 25th? i cant find any blizz post about it
[4:55:53] uhhhhyeayoo: Mythic 20 is easier than mid tier mythic bosses

[4:58:05] Zoludar: are evokers coming out in prepatch?
[4:58:06] Rodorann: max said it must be ture
[4:58:07] 91Niki: "I don't care about Christmas there for nobody else does" mentality right there lol
[4:58:15] Hyelander_: Gotta get them Christmas executive bonuses
[4:58:19] KyleEverett: Blizzard will ensure raids are on mythic raz asap so they can bug fix it. :D
[4:58:30] rbgdev: @91niki no that’s literally not what I meant
[4:58:38] rbgdev: I’m referring to the race to world first
[4:58:46] rbgdev: And what max talked about
[4:58:47] 91Niki: @Ajaexx "Nobody cares about Christmas" is what you said mate ;)
[4:58:52] rbgdev: I very much celebrate christmas
[4:58:57] gritbarontv: invoked a response, lol
[4:58:59] Rudric_Ice: then WF raiders will complain this raid tier was so easy like wtf
[4:58:59] rbgdev: I know exactly what I said
[4:59:17] Malkomod: @roadrrunnerr1 68 roadrunner was a nice model
[4:59:26] Rodorann: do you mean the raiders dont care about playing through christmas?
[4:59:33] rbgdev: Yea
[4:59:39] rbgdev: The world first raiders

[5:00:08] Yagr6: yea echo got weird on anduin
[5:00:36] Rudric_Ice: WoW drama Pog
[5:00:51] Rodorann: DRAMA? POGGERS
[5:00:52] TompsonX: Kinda ruins the race for me tbh
[5:00:56] TompsonX: It would be so much more fun on an even playing field
[5:00:58] Sonatta: delicious drama 😋
[5:01:06] Aidler: Scripe was very vocal…. for a global release. he even said at one point he wouldn’t continue raiding without a global release
[5:01:08] Yagr6: i get it though they put all they got into it
[5:01:18] NickyNiclas: D:
[5:01:24] LearnedSomething: I don't see the problem with NA starting ahead
[5:01:37] KyleEverett: Blizzard isn't gonna screw up their reset schedule just for 100 or so raiders

[5:02:00] Rodorann: if someone starts early cant you just copy what they do?
[5:02:05] NickyNiclas: If anything it'll make the race more interesting
[5:02:05] 91Niki: Nobody complains while they are ahead or winning. It isn't until they are losing that its unfair LUL
[5:02:15] Sonatta: gold debt LUL
[5:02:17] denflup: we need a 3 player tho, at some point it will become boring only watching liquit/echo
[5:02:24] denflup: liquid*
[5:02:42] LearnedSomething: it makes more sense to have a staggered release
[5:02:44] Zoludar: what problem would that cause for everyone to have a same reset?
[5:02:51] TSquadSully: TSquadSully subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[5:03:01] LearnedSomething: and to have your early release in your own timezone so you can respond in a timely manner to immediate issues
[5:03:12] KyleEverett: @Aruar89 Max already explained that as long as Echo and Liquid use the second best in their region as a recruiting base constantly will make it hard for a third place guild to really compete
[5:03:18] 91Niki: I mean, if it really was THAT big of an issue, EU players would just move to NA servers, fly their players out and call it a day.
[5:03:20] TheEnstraynomic: would chinese or korean guilds have a chance at world first, if they were as dedicated and organized as liquid and echo?
[5:03:34] TompsonX: Sounds about right
[5:03:35] irasin: @Towelliee how come you don't path of frost and then mount?

[5:06:18] Henke1983: some of them went to Method
[5:06:23] Molvonos: @mozavich Lets you mount up on your flying mount; cant mount up on flying mount in water.
[5:06:25] irasin: without having to go to land or an iceberg
[5:06:41] ManBehindTheBeard: @Towelliee is that a weak aura for experience bar?
[5:06:44] Yagr6: method is trying hard though

[5:07:47] Vann11: Vann11 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[5:22:22] pereadin: I NEED beta M+
[5:22:23] gritbarontv: sorry, it was me, crossed the skill streams
[5:22:24] Dudutoolbox: does pre patch mean shadowlands becomes free?
[5:22:24] Jamesthespud: Jamesthespud subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[5:23:28] 1llum1n471: So, I pre-purchased DF CE online like 2 months ago without letting my fiance know. Now I'm starting to suspect that she has also pre-purchased me a physical one based on her random ads that pop up.
[5:23:43] mikejames01: lolol
[5:23:50] mavericks312: my man said free
[5:23:54] mikejames01: at some point it will be in the sub
[5:23:58] 1llum1n471: Like, she does absolutely 0 gaming, and WoW keeps popping up in her ads...
[5:23:58] SpeciousArgument: last 3 prepatch the current expansion became baseline, yes
[5:23:58] Milkpocalypse: free real estate
[5:23:59] Shurn_82: not likely till DF is released

[5:24:06] Shaele: You are FREE to pay for it KEKW
[5:24:11] pereadin: I don't think they'll make keys as hard as we're expecting them to.  I think it would distress the player base too much

[5:24:27] c0mmander_starscream: You are FREE to pre-order

[5:25:57] Mitune: I mean if the base difficulty is lower then the scaling may result in the same experience. So 1-9 may be over all easier but 10+ will feel as they do now maybe Copium
