[5:45:59] Hekawolf: if those in the back have no target close, they will attack the whole raid iirc
[5:45:59] P4u7son91: it doenst matter how many are in the back bro.. only 2 are enough! just change position to swap stacks!
[5:45:59] BebopHero: lucky tanks GachiPls

[5:46:50] TruePkera: Soda just texted me
[5:46:53] oldmandinkleberg: just for backup
[5:46:57] d4rkirby: looks like Naxx
[5:46:58] Fro_ftw85: 1 tank and 1 healer at each of the bosses in the back. 1 tank holds both bosses at the front.

[5:47:05] Alexx_tv__: where is vei?
[5:47:07] P4u7son91: clueless people sent tank to the back! healer and ranged dps is the way to go.. ranged dps can still help dps the cleave in front
[5:47:08] johnrobertz: He shouldnt be back ther
[5:47:15] akrionft: @sodapoppin you get stacks in a 45 yard radius. So you have 1 tank and 1 healer for each boss back there who swap at 4 stacks. While ya‚Äôll kill the two in front. Easy enough

The range of the Alabama beach mouse historically included much of the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the Alabama Gulf coast and extends from Ono Island to Fort Morgan. Coastal residential and commercial development and roadway construction have fragmented and destroyed habitat used by this species.
