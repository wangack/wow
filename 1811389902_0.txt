[3:18:27] Capull0Spawn: lay of hand in Arena is the biggest joke
[3:18:34] BANISHERwow: retripaladin has now fun design which is good. If they make every spec that funny as ret is now the game would be awesome. I actually love rets now how they work

[3:19:55] Kriptz01: There's a solution and it's called -15% DPS overall.
[3:20:01] Kriptz01: That's it.
[3:20:14] Phurbos: that makes it not fun for healing.
[3:20:23] Phurbos: it's like saying we should take away damage from DPS
[3:20:56] crazypillz_pk: I haven’t played since mist and looking to get back in. Is dragon flight all new toons?

[3:21:30] axellent_x: if you 1v1 a healer as a dps, do you think you should be able to kill the healer while they have mana
[3:21:31] SirSirenS: swifty is right imo
[3:21:31] Galaxar40: sry caps
[3:21:36] kshr_taco: Hey Swifty. I remember watching your videos with you and Atheeen
[3:21:39] Cultrian: now every player has 25% increased hp and all npcs/bosses does 25% more dmg, plus there were buffs for selfhealing abilities
[3:21:41] Cowardpatty: Sorry, you used all your DPS for this boss fight.  No victory tea for you.
[3:21:41] BANISHERwow: this way we are punishing healers too much. who would like to play them
[3:21:55] martes1987: The game was more interesting when healing was less and bandages was important.
[3:22:15] Capull0Spawn: as a Hunter sometimes i miss the antimanashot. dont know the name in english :(
[3:22:18] Phurbos: dampening already punishes healers for playing a healer.
[3:22:28] Phurbos: It's not fun to run out of mana and just be like, sorry bro.
[3:22:34] tooca_: fortnite
[3:22:42] dreadprince: J
[3:22:44] BareGrizzly0: eq2 died because SOE sold the game and killed the market. they also wanted people to make bank toons
[3:22:48] axellent_x: @Swifty if you 1v1 a healer as a dps, do you think you should be able to kill the healer while they have mana

[5:07:41] IrisNX: SKYNET
[5:07:55] sewer_creature: It would be interesting to save those results and do exactly same searches few years later to see how it has improved
[5:07:57] Maclonie: How much does that cost?
[5:08:14] coconust1: What is available in the public domain in terms of AI is not even really 5% of what it is capable of right now. Now that's scary xD
[5:08:16] s4boi: gimme that website lol
[5:08:19] dawnstrike: Midjourney
[5:08:24] Deathis_Twitch: Midjourney no doubt
[5:08:25] GamingWithWood: AI is not the issue...robotics are not the issue, it's when they combine them and it becomes self-aware
[5:08:27] igotadealforyou: What is it called?
[5:08:34] GamingWithWood: Then we are in trouble
[5:08:39] Grael1256: Midjourney
[5:08:46] btideroll: my man SWIFTY! Good lord man we've been at this since 2004. You are legit the ultimate, the legend, the original, and have carried the torch. As a fellow boomer I cannot thank you enough for doing this journey with me. I am serious.
[5:08:49] JoshSpace13: @sewer_creature there was a recent post on reddit of someone using the same promts a couple of years later. It's day and night difference
[5:08:54] zorkxzx: @swifty they say that in a decade there will be ai androids who will do stuff for humans
[5:09:29] leroyjenkins97: Yes, because they already have their models trained with millions of images and styles. Training the models actually takes a lot of time. But when you type on that website you are testing (not training) which takes a lot faster since the AI model just uses the training to respond to your query (the text you type).
[5:09:55] JonnyScotland: @zorkxzx they where saying that 60 years ago, Also people claiming we would have flying cars by now, didn't happen
[5:09:56] savagestrix: the boston dynamic robots are next level
[5:10:06] JoshSpace13: AI has a hard time generating hands, eyes and lips properly atm, unless it's told to focus on those @Swifty
[5:10:07] 300Stone: you know soulja boy is playing wow right now
[5:10:25] eoi_attritshun: @JoshSpace13 Not anymore, they already made advancements there

[5:11:01] JoshSpace13: it still has a hard time on those @eoi_attritshun , unless it;s told to focus on it
[5:11:04] druidosaurus: Let's not forget we're all training the AI by completing captcha where we identify objects. Google sells that data to other companies Kreygasm
[5:11:07] leroyjenkins97: Holyyyy
[5:11:16] Viggoviking: Hey Swifty, is this your only toon atm or are you also play ally?
