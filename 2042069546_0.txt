[0:51:04] waldfennek: and did you try holy this week so far?
[0:51:05] wellfedisaaq: @yumytv how do you play with dorki when he at times can be so toxic and "do what i say" attitude?
[0:51:29] ShaggySummers: @wellfedisaaq honesty and directness are very helpful
[0:51:46] wellfedisaaq: @ShaggySummers toxicity is never helpfull
[0:51:54] wellfedisaaq: Allot of times it just comes from ego
[0:51:59] ShaggySummers: here's nothing toxic about knowing what to do
[0:52:23] wellfedisaaq: Yeah, but i seen dorki just leave to go to bed and "order" hes team to do "homework" keys so he can do the high ones when he logs on??
[0:52:26] wellfedisaaq: thats like giga toxic
[0:52:40] wellfedisaaq: bro
[0:52:51] wellfedisaaq: ur enabling him by calling him a "top tank" and being fine with that behaviour
[0:52:54] waldfennek: in S1 i reached R1 title as healer. But this season it feels to hard to be chill in keys. So many moments when everything is on fire and you got no answer to it. Any advices? (currently on 27+ Keys)
[0:52:59] Avelstoon: but does he go non verbal? =P
[0:53:06] wellfedisaaq: Even christiano ronaldo has to come to practise or he gets benched
[0:53:18] fabsnipo: alone catPOV in AD
[0:53:31] Lobsterclaw: It really isn't that big a deal. If people were bothered they could just not play with him. Relax @wellfedisaaq
[0:53:49] simon11111987: @wellfedisaaq I don’t think you get it, they don’t have to pay with him, if they want to get the top keys done they have to do that stuff, you don’t have to.
[0:53:55] ipastrychef_gr: Hey, just watched your guide for resto druid on yt. Do you recommend the same talents for raiding or theres a different build?
[0:54:04] wellfedisaaq: idk, it just dosnt sit right with me people walking over others and those people enabling it and being okey with it...
[0:54:12] wellfedisaaq: its a lack of respect
[0:54:25] Nvkla: so double ret new meta ?
[0:54:43] Lobsterclaw: Let people live their own lives. You don't have to play respect cop for others x)
[0:54:54] Svesno: How bad is your sleep schedule on scale 1-10? 10 being worst

[1:00:17] Varsader: anyone know if the healer streams? LUL
[1:00:24] simon11111987: @wellfedisaaq Btw, I think it’s toxic coming into someone else’s stream badmouthing one of the streamers friends and trying to turn them against each other. In your head growl goes “yeah you’re right, I’ll never play with dorkI again” breaking up the greatest tank healer combo to ever exist, ruining peoples stream experience, toxic af
[1:01:17] Hekistylz: Chatting
[1:01:59] ShaggySummers: I recently joined this team as the 6th man. My main task is finding out why deaths were not actually Growls fault
[1:03:02] ShaggySummers: also we're still trying to optimize the hammer count on screen
[1:03:34] Varsader: Well, judging by the meter Growl isn't the healer so it can't be his fault. Obviously it's the paladins.

[1:46:52] Lobsterclaw: The reset on Apotheosis I guess is too long of a cd to work
[1:46:55] Fresh_Pr1nce: Why do so many holy not talent the aoe heals? Are they that bad?
[1:47:05] Fresh_Pr1nce: Prayer/circle.
[1:47:07] Narien: rageyheart
[1:47:07] Lilibet69: what’s the changes on the priest? not been able to play atm
[1:47:14] lolkittinz: is this week worse than last week?
[1:47:35] frejaclueless: Circle of healing feels really good to press, so I run it even if its bad lul
[1:47:58] Lobsterclaw: If only Healing Rain wasn't so awful for healing
[1:47:59] Fresh_Pr1nce: @frejaclueless I like it but prayer feels so awful to press.
[1:48:00] Hyvest: Nah, not crazy
[1:48:10] Fresh_Pr1nce: It does feel really fast now
[1:48:11] Hyvest: damage profiles suck
[1:48:20] Fresh_Pr1nce: I figured I was just slow mentally
[1:48:21] frejaclueless: @Fresh_Pr1nce Oh I don't even have prayer on my bars in my m+ build never pressing it xdd
[1:48:34] 1111111111112233: id say s1 had way worse aoe dmg fights than this season
[1:48:50] Hyvest: Theun has a video on it, also talking about talent trees a bit
[1:48:54] Lilibet69: oh nice. might go check my main. been missing playing her but it felt so ‘invisible’
[1:48:58] frejaclueless: Tettles made a video with Theun about this, they looked at overhealing in raid etc
[1:49:32] Lobsterclaw: Do you like Sanctuary over Divine Aegis that much? I've been quite split on those 2 for a while.
[1:49:43] Pallavos: Thats so true
[1:49:47] Lacee666: big true
[1:49:59] Whitritt: Tanks should be the only ones with more than 1 defensive imo
[1:50:10] frejaclueless: NODDERS
[1:50:15] Hyvest: delete healing cds and make us struggle on rot fights again
[1:50:15] frejaclueless: PREACH
[1:50:18] TheUncleJohn: only healers/tanks should have defensives, make them external for healers and i would actualy love to heal that way and dont rely on a monkey dps to press button
[1:51:11] Jemba: just heal it bro 4Head
[1:51:49] Fresh_Pr1nce: If you take away dps defensives and improve cc maybe they will click the button. Different damage stop.
[1:51:56] Lacee666: and for me too BBoomer
[1:52:06] frejaclueless: Didn't Evokers have more defensives in their hero talents?
[1:52:10] Lilibet69: sweet jeebus. you’ve just made me realise I know NOTHING about my priest 😳
[1:52:10] Vods: Wouldnt a frost dk without its beefyness .. just be a warrior Aware
[1:52:24] ReSeT_VT: remove all defensives from dps, leave all to be healer externals
[1:52:28] ReSeT_VT: BASEG
[1:52:31] maxthrustt: two globals really
[1:52:35] Eloris_: Two globals, right? SInce you need another global to go back to moonkin form.
[1:52:51] Ralynx: druids should have some invoke the other forms button so you benefit from that type
[1:52:58] frejaclueless: Double ice cold no? cause cold snap
[1:53:02] Lacee666: CognitiveOverload
[1:53:10] ReSeT_VT: also cheat death
[1:53:21] frejaclueless: Ahh I didn't know it was only for frost
[1:53:22] lolkittinz: oh yeah forgot about cheat lol
[1:53:35] Fresh_Pr1nce: I felt like the self sustainability has snowballed so hard for tanks/dps at low/mid keys that idk why they even need me. I feel like I'm just healing myself most of the time.
[1:53:55] Fresh_Pr1nce: I love getting clapped by leech on some pulls.
[1:53:56] ReSeT_VT: yea mage/monk feels bad
[1:54:02] ReSeT_VT: because of the extra 200 buttons
[1:54:45] flickflackoverduck69: yo what time is it for you ive never seen you stream this time
[1:55:02] frejaclueless: Yea very fun, love the changes
[1:55:07] Drvvn: I started playing disc 2 weeks ago, and its the most fun I've had in a while
[1:55:13] imjebb: bout how GIGA them buttons feel together
[1:55:18] jaqueeg: AJ said it was boring af
[1:55:18] ShaggySummers: Disc is simple? I always thought it's complex as hell...
[1:55:18] Drvvn: The tier set is so good too
[1:55:41] ShaggySummers: yay ads
[1:55:43] Fresh_Pr1nce: @ShaggySummers Easy since it got sorta reworked.
[1:55:50] ReSeT_VT: you just describing monk dps xdd
[1:55:54] keenxp: while focusing on equilibrium xdd
[1:56:13] Hyvest: feel like equilibrium feels great
[1:56:26] Lilibet69: making me feel really bad for dumping my priest for my hunter 😔
[1:56:26] Hyvest: that's a weird sentence
[1:56:30] keenxp: now it does, before it was a little feelsdank
[1:56:34] SCMSV: Some fun comes from complexity but too much can be bad for sure
[1:56:42] reppap: Part of the problem is the active nodes in the trees are always more powerful so you have to take them, which leads to this bloat
[1:56:43] ShaggySummers: Druids are known to not like trees
[1:56:58] Jemba: Streaming bear with me
[1:58:02] ReSeT_VT: I haven't played other healers but mw, how do you compare it to the other healers?
[1:58:13] ReSeT_VT: I am always looking for  a fun class
[1:58:23] Deemonlord: wow man, you take this game seriosly!
[1:58:28] Fresh_Pr1nce: Exponential mana scaling rejuv arcane mage style
[1:58:28] 1111111111112233: yeah but it looks cooler if there are more hots on the frames
[1:58:52] mk__9: button bloat Sadge
[1:58:55] Ralynx: cen ward is a pre-hot? and way more intense than rejuv right
[1:58:57] ReSeT_VT: hot healer is based on hots PepeLaugh
[1:59:03] Lilibet69: wow man, you take this game seriosly!  made me realise I’m playing like a toddler!
[1:59:14] Grouuchy: is pressing rejuv 4 times on someone adding more to the druid gameplay?
[1:59:19] Ralynx: it USED to have much more use bc tank damage/swiftmend extend
[1:59:37] zamow1994: verdancy is cool
[1:59:45] zamow1994: raid healing is ass tho
[1:59:52] Ralynx: and tbh didnt it get dropped in pve/picked in pvp? cen ward used to be the sole healing of rdru pvp
[2:00:15] keenxp: caffeine for two lifeblooms ICANT
[2:00:20] alezedar: Pressing Lifebloom 3 times in pvp already felt awful, i think if we want hots to stack it feels better if the cast time heals stack them up.
[2:00:23] ReSeT_VT: i have really enjoyed mistweaver, do you think that is fine from a rotation perspective ?
[2:00:30] Lacee666: and i dont think hero talents will help this..
[2:00:31] simon11111987: I quite like it, you have to have variance otherwise the game becomes boring
[2:00:40] Hyvest: Renewing Mist feels dumb to press without tier
[2:00:46] yourfavoritegorf: yooo grom time WideBoris
[2:00:50] Drvvn: I feel like fire mage is a really good example of few button (at least in the core rotation) and good complexity
[2:01:12] Fresh_Pr1nce: Sheilun's is such a fun button to press
[2:01:28] lemonbounded: Just joined but whats your view on current Hpal
[2:01:34] ReSeT_VT: having 5x mists out and spamming fistweaving feels great, even though it's not a CD
[2:02:01] Ralynx: i love being able to provide more use than my healing when im a healer
[2:02:03] smuggamer1337: NOTED
[2:02:10] nvpal: chi burst needs to go
[2:02:11] Ralynx: catweaving was the most fun ive had healing
[2:02:14] ReSeT_VT: should i... click chi burst? MONKA
[2:02:16] zolal3: ICANT chi burst
[2:02:17] TrolltwopointO: I wonder how are they gonna balance next expansion where we loose the OP Mistweaver set
[2:02:21] Hyvest: Healers shouldn't be able to top people in 1-2 globals so oneshots can die
[2:02:24] Meteox: Removing defensives? HUHH
[2:02:44] Domeu: button bloat on most healers is all too real
[2:02:48] ReSeT_VT: sheilun is cool because it also gives a buff
[2:02:50] nvpal: If the party is spread and there is aoe dmg incoming you are fucked
[2:02:51] Fresh_Pr1nce: That requires making cast mw actually decent
[2:03:14] Ralynx: @ReSeT_VT isnt that talented? high keyers dont play the buff iirc
[2:03:18] 1111111111112233: palworld LOGIN
[2:03:19] Vods: @Meteox the cat wants to remove the defenses from my frost dk Sadge
[2:03:43] Meteox: @Vods Suske This cat is acting really off today.
[2:03:54] Vods: Not a morning cat Susge
[2:04:01] Meteox: Suske .....
[2:04:01] ReSeT_VT: @Ralynx idk, i'm new to the class so I took the wowhead build, but removed some things that I felt were too much like zen pulse
[2:04:04] Fresh_Pr1nce: @Ralynx They take the faster CD over the buff typically.
[2:04:33] Zootiie: Zen pulse cranks damage so I love it lol
[2:04:38] Vods: gettingjiggywithit chipi chipi
[2:04:41] Ralynx: yeah the buff is rng too so some of them dont have much use
[2:05:00] ReSeT_VT: but I really like the buff from sheilun, I think if they worked on the rng nature of it it would be great
[2:05:02] Ralynx: @Zootiie the talent for double zen pulse is so janky though imo
[2:05:06] frejaclueless: Chat what is TODD?
[2:05:09] frejaclueless: or what did he say
[2:05:16] Ralynx: @frejaclueless touch of death
[2:05:21] frejaclueless: OHHH
[2:05:21] Aggroboy: Prodigy Pog
[2:05:22] frejaclueless: yeah awful
[2:05:23] Shaundhi: @yumytv how you feeling about resto shaman. They seem to be pretty sleeper
[2:06:05] suinetel: RDruid feels so awful in Raids. Like rejuvanation build at least.
[2:06:08] Zootiie: @ralynx it’s not too bad, lines up pretty well with insta cast from chi-Ji
[2:06:09] Shaundhi: Shaundhi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! o7
[2:06:11] zolal3: revert CB nerfs pls Prayge
[2:06:16] Fresh_Pr1nce: Will we get another "Viewer tries to heal high key" video this expac? Love those.
[2:06:32] Aandromega: Aandromega subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! o7
[2:06:36] lemonbounded: @yumytv view on hpal?
[2:06:51] Fresh_Pr1nce: Totally get it, just wondering if we'll see more of those ever.
[2:07:17] Meteox: Paladins were a mistake RAGEY
[2:07:21] Fresh_Pr1nce: hpal mains collectively boycotting until it becomes overtuned again
[2:07:40] Zootiie: Hpal just does no damage and the throughput I feel is too low hps wise
[2:07:49] Zootiie: Their externals go brr tho
[2:07:50] Meteox: Watch my WoW stream: dorki dorkiUSA
[2:07:53] Ralynx: im not a high key player, but when i stumble upon a good hpala i feel so safe all dungeon
[2:07:56] Vods: BinoculousTogether
[2:08:15] Hyvest: the r2 pally is 3.7k and a pug enjoyer
[2:08:34] Ralynx: what comps though
[2:08:35] Aggroboy: Paladins are kings of gaslighting, they were even complaining in Season 2
[2:08:38] ReSeT_VT: hpal might be good but now if ret joins the meta comp that definitely pushes hpal a bit down
[2:09:15] ReSeT_VT: can't wait to rekk some keys on my ret, if only I had leggo dorkiSad

[2:09:50] Aggroboy: paladins can be top of meta and still be gaslighting, like reddit hpals are saying they have less utility than monks
[2:09:51] Ralynx: Imo Hpala mains are some of the best players, they just dont play when their spec is dog
[2:10:24] Syzzy_28: xdd

[2:10:59] Fresh_Pr1nce: Wasn't there the acc sharing issue
[2:10:59] tasty_panda1: The CN server closed down
[2:11:02] Fresh_Pr1nce: Yeah ^^
[2:11:06] tasty_panda1: So they are all playing in TW
[2:11:10] dorki: I mean it's not all the same but

[2:11:18] Wolfywing: Blood DK is king
[2:11:30] Syzzy_28: bear route xdd
[2:11:34] Jemba: xddDespair
[2:11:37] IAttackYou: thats so beans
[2:11:41] IAttackYou: to have that many casters
[2:11:41] ReSeT_VT: how are other tanks ever going to be in meta with vengeance having 10000 stops?
[2:11:45] Vods: Frost DK aoe confuse xdd
[2:11:45] IAttackYou: this season's dungeon sucks
[2:11:53] simon11111987: I planned to play pres evoker and Resto shaman this tier, didn’t go well
[2:11:54] Aggroboy: I watched brew keys, they were getting rekt
[2:12:15] Hyvest: Rsham mains don't quit if they're not r1
[2:12:31] Ralynx: @Hyvest true they are so diehard :D
[2:12:45] verilonn: Isnt hpal gameplay also omega ass right now?
[2:12:59] Aggroboy: resto druid raid gameplay is even more omega ass
[2:13:05] Syzzy_28: prevoker xdd
[2:13:08] ReSeT_VT: what is that weird monk color xdd
[2:13:10] dorki: no1 plays evoker that's y
[2:13:11] Ralynx: Why play pres when aug exists? xd
[2:13:12] Fresh_Pr1nce: I forget prevoker is a thing at least twice a day
[2:13:18] Aandromega: Believe in the weave brothers
[2:13:28] simon11111987: pres really struggles in pugs, it can be awful
[2:13:33] Hyvest: some rshams were cooking stacking trees on fyrakk and slt + spam surge on self to somehow make it work on that boss
[2:13:37] Aggroboy: prevoker is kinda annoying this season, so many area of denial
[2:13:48] Hyvest: healer comps in raid are fucked
[2:14:01] imjebb: i havent even played with a prez this season
[2:14:08] imjebb: pres*
[2:14:10] Ralynx: bc rogue/mage somehow always have a use
[2:14:12] ReSeT_VT: based opinion alert: nobody wanna play evoker because it's a dogshit class (low range, low mobility, etc.) and the second they won't have a numerically dominant spec, literally nobody will play evoker
[2:14:18] Chat_beaute: Y as a tank I feel that switching from one another pretty easy
[2:14:25] Warslug: I only play mage because it will always be meta
[2:14:28] 1111111111112233: i met 1 prevoker in all the keys i pugged and he told me to stand infront of him never want to see it again
[2:14:38] Jemba: augs RageyBoom
[2:14:41] Meteox: Ele modCheck
[2:14:42] Dermortis1990: Please Buff Rogue. As always bottom of everything Pepega
[2:14:44] Rehax: evoker just makes keys comfy. lack of damage is fine until the very very top of keys
[2:14:45] Ralynx: Mage went from not picked to meta in 1 set of buffs
[2:14:47] Aggroboy: did Mage need those buffs?
[2:14:50] bardabrax: i actually really enjoy playing pres idk
[2:15:09] blackguy61: KEKW
[2:15:11] dknamey: yo lava burst spam is actually fun
[2:15:21] SaosinTV: hows frost dk in title range
[2:15:22] qsdc: mage was beans in raid without buffs
[2:15:26] kaysiix: did u move to EU @yumytv  ? or do u have insomnia
[2:15:39] ren0m: They forgot to add feral
[2:15:39] Aggroboy: i played preservation this season, it's awful due to a lot of area denial in the encounters
[2:15:40] 1111111111112233: warrior is kinda shocking
[2:15:40] verilonn: WW cranks
[2:15:47] Syzzy_28: xddDespair

[2:15:55] Meteox: @kaysiix Cat stuff, ya know BedgeCat
[2:15:59] yourfavoritegorf: What class plays afflicted
[2:16:00] yourfavoritegorf: HMM
[2:16:08] Ralynx: even BM is garbage now
[2:16:10] Dermortis1990: On the left side there is BM/MM yet MM isnt included in Title range? KEKW
[2:16:15] Ralynx: Try pugging past 25 as a nobody
[2:16:16] IAttackYou: thats also way better
[2:16:20] Rehax: if you one-trick a spec of a class that has multiple dps specs youre an idiot xdd
[2:16:41] wildwittra: do they have popular comps for 0.1% ?
[2:16:43] kaysiix: woaw tank balance is SO GOOD
[2:16:56] kaysiix: 2 specs account for more than 90% of tank
[2:17:00] simon11111987: tough expansion for shaman and warrior
[2:17:08] kaysiix: @Meteox ha ok x)
[2:17:09] Ralynx: @wildwittra 100%
[2:17:13] Fresh_Pr1nce: There's like, at least 10 holy in title range lol.
[2:17:22] daniel1505: I'm unhappy cos i play hpal

[2:17:40] Meteox: Watch my WoW stream: dorki dorkiUSA
[2:17:42] Aggroboy: HPals were the only choice last season
[2:17:45] Dz3ro: Madge
[2:17:47] Shaundhi: I'm a rsham main and I am completely happy with how balancing is
[2:17:51] IAttackYou: xddPeat
[2:17:54] Hyvest: kinda surprised by 15 holy priests above 3540
[2:17:56] Shaundhi: Honestly didn't need the 5%
[2:17:58] Aandromega: I'm not sure im a fan of the new rdruid playstyle
[2:18:03] dorki: I did dk raid no axe gg
[2:18:05] Ralynx: Does it make sense to you that BM hunter with low util, also got major damage nerfs?
[2:18:08] IAttackYou: gg
[2:18:09] FFlasHeRs: I’m a veng dh and want two brez in key and my healer a shaman what could be a great comp for me I keep picking the worst comps with no brez classes lol
[2:18:19] kaysiix: @dorki bro , just loot it ?? do some effort dude
[2:18:21] dorki: bm hunter nerfed cause it's op in raid
[2:18:23] Aggroboy: nerf Vengeance too
[2:18:33] yourfavoritegorf: be the tank u want to see in the world
[2:18:39] kondelol: change scene RAGEY
[2:18:44] Ralynx: @dorki smh, balancing all forms of content at the same time just feels backwards
[2:18:52] Syzzy_28: i wanna click on you irl Plotge
[2:18:55] Meteox: But I liked that scene FeelsBadMan
[2:18:56] Shaundhi: @FFlasHeRs boom fits nice, take advantage of you party buff
[2:18:56] dorki: they will never balance just for m+
[2:19:00] Ralynx: @dorki fire mage comes to mind...buffing ST is buffing aoe??
[2:19:07] Jemba: two ppl named shock HMM
[2:19:09] reppap: rdruid keys Gladge
[2:19:33] Rehax: @dorki they will never balance m+
[2:19:42] Rehax: we gotta live with being the secondary gamemode Sadge
[2:19:56] Rehax: no way we get prio balancing xdd
[2:20:06] Aggroboy: isn't Dorki having trouble with MDI signups
[2:20:07] IAttackYou: gear up growlpala
[2:20:09] Meteox: Sadge Dorki leaving us. How could you Dorki...
[2:20:09] Shaundhi: @FFlasHeRs ret too
[2:20:14] Fresh_Pr1nce: Variety healer content is class
[2:20:26] Ralynx: Even the rise nerfs at week 11 of the season confuses me
[2:20:29] IAttackYou: on prot
[2:20:35] Hyvest: peat  pug adventures
[2:20:35] IAttackYou: fuck donki , tank instead
[2:20:40] Meteox: BedgeCat 💤
[2:20:50] RyanC: gotta re mount. happens to me too
[2:20:55] vartence2: the dragon riding interface is really buggy lol
[2:20:56] IAttackYou: bring back donki fan
[2:21:00] Meteox: wideNessie
[2:21:08] FFlasHeRs: gotcha Ty for all the feedback
[2:21:52] Zootiie: Which healer do you think suits the dungeons best this season?
[2:21:55] Fresh_Pr1nce: Is now a bad time to switch from my spriest to holy priest gearing
[2:21:58] Aggroboy: disc for sure
[2:22:38] Fresh_Pr1nce: I always try dps thinking I want to pump then realize I just like healing 99% of the time.
[2:22:55] Ralynx: @Fresh_Pr1nce disc is a nice balance for that imo
[2:23:00] Viking2512: does atonement still have range or is the buff enough?
[2:23:23] kaysiix: did that DH proc cheat death ?
[2:23:23] suinetel: Is the Fyrakk tank trinket the meta in absolute highest tyrannical keys for all classes for which it is available?
[2:23:34] zolozw: @Viking2512 one hundred yard
[2:23:39] Fresh_Pr1nce: @Ralynx I do like disc, penance is a fun button.
[2:23:44] FFlasHeRs: god that dh cheated death right away he had feel dev and meta weird
[2:23:55] Hyvest: radiance has 30yd range iirc
[2:24:07] Jemba: healing meters RAGEY
[2:24:07] reppap: @FFlasHeRs gotta use your abilities on cooldown
[2:24:09] Viking2512: @zolozw thanks! I last played disc in cata and was mad when dps wasn't standing next to the mobs
[2:24:09] Zootiie: What’s strengths do you think fistweaver has vs disc/rdruid
[2:24:11] trin_jp: typhoon and hibernate...?
[2:24:11] zolozw: @Hyvest 40 yard range 30 yard bounce
[2:24:16] Ralynx: @Fresh_Pr1nce yeah penance is so satisfying. i used to find that with soothing mist but MW isnt really a caster healer anymore
[2:24:34] trin_jp: can run out after boss, have 30s :)
[2:24:36] zounikin: you have 2 dmg metter!!!
[2:24:47] Fresh_Pr1nce: @Ralynx I would play a bunch more mw if caster was a legit option.
[2:24:56] FrostmagicED: truuuuuuu
[2:25:03] FrostmagicED: sometimes the first pull at the top of the stairs
[2:25:20] reppap: spires was kind of the same Aware
[2:25:25] Fresh_Pr1nce: The jadefire visual rework is nice to stare at though
[2:25:29] Ralynx: @Fresh_Pr1nce tbh i pref holy priest also bc guardian is a really nice button too. id love if holy had some aoe DR button though
[2:25:30] Jemba: xdd
[2:25:34] dr_shoe: Sp and ele actually pumping
[2:25:37] Zootiie: @fresh_pr1nce but fw is so much fun
[2:25:43] nicoboot: what drios are active?
[2:25:44] trin_jp: did you teleport to dungeon? if not you could probably portal out, change talent and run back in during the 30s waiting for the door to open after 1st boss
[2:25:45] 1111111111112233: xddDespair
[2:25:45] nicoboot: drops*
[2:26:08] Fresh_Pr1nce: @Ralynx Guardian, apoth, serenity and sanctify are all fun buttons imo.
[2:26:08] Imagine1456: Ive been playing resto shaman, watching this makes me feel like ive just picked the wrong sppec.
[2:26:25] Aandromega: Dreamwalk, respec, dreamwalk will take u to the entrance?
[2:26:25] nicoboot: Ye normally it does, can't find it this time
[2:26:26] deepcalm: it's a "grim campfire" toy
[2:26:33] deepcalm: its a spooky looking campfire
[2:26:48] VicinityGamer: have you ever considered going eu?
[2:26:49] Fresh_Pr1nce: @Zootiie It is fun but I am simple minded healer who can't see my screen good enough to play in melee. I'm a cuck who likes to watch 20 yrds away.
[2:26:49] nicoboot: WICKED
[2:27:09] trin_jp: for kitty convoke does it matter how many combo points you have?
[2:27:09] Zootiie: @fresh_pr1nce lol fair
[2:27:11] nicoboot: Your DK was on EU right?
[2:27:19] kaysiix: U are already on EU time tho LUL
[2:27:21] trin_jp: like does it prio bites more than shred if you already have full combo points?
[2:27:30] Jemba: come to EU AlienDance
[2:27:50] Ralynx: @trin_jp if anything it builds your points iirc
[2:28:08] Zootiie: Is rdruid the second highest dps healer?
[2:28:09] Aggroboy: doesn't peat have hibernate
[2:28:15] trin_jp: yeah it builds points, but thought maybe there was a rule that it wouldn't try to build if you have full cp already
[2:29:03] FrostmagicED: @trin_jp the ONLY thing you need to know is that you want to moonfire and rake before b/c it'll apply a 2nd stack of the dot esp if ur bees are on it
[2:29:05] Ralynx: @trin_jp there is some prio for the special abilties. but it wont avoid something if full cp
[2:29:26] Ralynx: @trin_jp example is like, im sure it does double moonfire if the target has normal moonfire and convoke moonfire
[2:30:00] Zootiie: Been getting like 80+k dps in 20+’s on my fistweaver, feels nice. But rdruid looks gross damage
[2:30:45] kaysiix: Those spiders dont put poison on u if u are full hp and use fyrrak trinket ? like the dragon in fall ?
[2:31:26] Syzzy_28: druid discord PepeLaugh
[2:31:32] Ralynx: i think in SL it was that you want to do it in melee for thrashs as opposes to more moonfires or something
[2:31:50] trin_jp: bloom in dawn
[2:32:23] kaysiix: wish some mobs attack were easier to understand
[2:32:33] kaysiix: and not needing to watch a cat with waffle to know
[2:33:04] hal98: why is the lady saying dutch
[2:33:28] RastaDino: catbleed in DHT is brutal too
[2:33:30] trin_jp: what's the wa for spell cd as bars? i only know the nameplate one
[2:33:32] Shaundhi: Dodge
[2:33:35] kamby69: xdd

[2:35:59] Zootiie: @the_pyke I feel like healing the lost boss when the adds pops is more rough imo
[2:36:20] Ralynx: @yumytv any thoughts on adding a pause button for pugs in keys? could actually give you time to explain the upcoming thing
[2:36:32] minaki: hi, can you help me with vault please? got 2 things and cant decide which to take
[2:37:10] Fresh_Pr1nce: @Ralynx Can't wait for a key to wipe and have troll pausers

[2:40:14] Aandromega: Ooooooooo
[2:40:22] Fresh_Pr1nce: Fall would be so fun if manifested timeways didn't exist.
[2:40:23] trin_jp: @Russclarto if chromie is dying from full, it means the tank isn't soaking the little circle in front
[2:40:42] SaosinTV: little circle just does a nasty bleed

[2:42:02] zolal3: and people dont listen to your dispell order
[2:42:04] deepcalm: i think some tanks don't reposition themselves in the soak after it nudges them back
[2:42:05] Zootiie: Boss*
[2:42:18] ConchubarOD: it sucks in pugs, but the keys I do we can easily time it if a dps screws it up and dies.

[2:43:02] Aandromega: Overwatch are stream watchers
[2:43:08] Zootiie: Seeing dps move the wrong wall in fall and smacking 3 orbs in a row
[2:43:18] Zootiie: Just move right
[2:43:19] Ralynx: Did anyone know you can now buy 441 ilvl gear for alts in the portal room for flightstones?

[3:20:04] AdryenGaming: I loved battle as a raid, it was great fun.  That .5 instance after Battle was the worst, so many guilds just didn't even try it on mythic as it was tuned for top 50 guilds and the benefit to clearing it just didn't exist

[3:21:18] Aggroboy: Best healer this season
[3:22:06] oevrit: penance proc feels good
[3:22:07] notpadfoot: I think Tjuan is playing with holy priest
[3:22:09] the_pyke: disc is just so bäh ... is there some1 rly enjoys disc?
[3:22:42] robeyres: the thing I’m struggling with learning disc is when the ape damage comes in panic mode starts I’m so used to being a reactive healer rather than being ready for the damage I need to work on that
[3:22:59] robeyres: aoe not ape
[3:23:33] Aggroboy: Disc is so good this season M+
[3:23:43] pepirossler: I hate pugging as disc cause dpls always does some stupid stuff and disc spot healing is kinda weak
[3:24:08] MaidrosTwin: xdd

[3:27:34] Aggroboy: Druid wishes it could heal while DPS like fistweaver or disc
[3:27:35] kondelol: I RAGEY when my dps take and I cant be in cat form
[3:27:45] simon11111987: Do think there is a personal trait that all healers have in common? Like why else would we suffer through all the pain and suffering for no appreciation?
[3:27:52] Lagbugddosdc: secret mistweaver proc that makes your tank go non verbal
[3:28:02] simon11111987: *personality
[3:28:25] BipolarPongal: How do you go about ST healing
[3:28:25] Aggroboy: I feel healer is easier than DPS
[3:28:30] AdryenGaming: @kondelol This is common when learning in lower keys. DPS constantly taking avoidable damage so you can't weave and then getting to dps on bosses
[3:28:39] Senril: so halo = bad
[3:28:43] pepirossler: how do you heal the big bleed in wm on 1st boss?
[3:28:48] TwicksTV: Bro its 7am

[3:31:19] Zootiie: Do you prefer to play a healer like disc/fw where you heal through damage or more like r Druid / h priest where you kinda have to choose
[3:31:25] TwicksTV: I'm staying up all night on war within release

[3:33:27] kesh405: it is fun to press button and see health go up

[3:53:27] GilesVGC: uh, they like competitive shit, but they get in their own heads pretty easily and shut down, and I don't know how to not have that happen
[3:53:38] AdryenGaming: I think if anything this month we have learnt you don't need friends, just like minded individuals that can tolerate one another up until the point you must mute midway through a WM
[3:53:53] dethbybunnies: weekly m5 bois
[3:53:54] cokezer0o: alot of people suck in wow thats the main reason LOL
[3:54:03] GilesVGC: they say they want to
[3:55:21] cokezer0o: unless you have my friends who are stuck at 22 some how
[3:55:38] infektyd: @GilesVGC youll just have to game and carry them till they are comfy and have the confidence, about it.
[3:55:49] Jayaresmith: yeah the community expects you to be a gigachad or ur dog dity
[3:56:01] Jayaresmith: dgo dirt *
[3:56:04] AdryenGaming: WoW is primarily built for the casual Andy, with some sections to cater for those that wish to do more competitive stuff
[3:56:18] Blackiichan_: Despairge too real
[3:56:20] cokezer0o: i feel like wow takes alot of skill in hard content that alot of people cant do
[3:56:24] mistr__p: that only happens if you play competitive
[3:56:25] velience: that's just pug dhs LUL
[3:56:30] ShaggySummers: terrorist-shaming! D:
[3:56:38] AdryenGaming: nothing wrong with being a casual andy. Also there will be folks that used to want to compete and now can't due to work or life obligations and then have to come to terms with being more casual
[3:56:45] Vods: @mistr__p you have never played casual OW KEKW
[3:56:46] kondelol: xdd 󠀀
[3:56:50] ewbrad: i agree with that

[3:57:02] mistr__p: and wow
[3:57:04] midsandhighs: Quick Play OW is some of the sweatiest shit I've ever seen
[3:57:15] panacer: overwatch quickplay is way sweatier and far more toxic than comp lol
[3:57:42] kondelol: xdd
[3:57:48] AdryenGaming: I don't find that in 1v1 stuff though - SC2 ladder for example isn't that toxic
[3:58:03] mistr__p: probably couse it's 1v1
[3:58:09] AdryenGaming: because there's nowhere to hide, you can blame race OP but if you mess up and lose its on you
[3:58:10] oevrit: when is the 0-hero vid coming out
[3:58:13] AdryenGaming: 100%
