[1:19:44] lano_da_goat: for pve
[1:19:44] back2r00ts: swiftyALLIANCE  :)
[1:19:45] Divinedreaming: people went for the easy mode paladins for pve, no world buffs, makes horde speed clearing slower
[1:19:49] mgkillaz: its pretty balanced on EU pvp servers at least on my realm
[1:19:49] Litlerhc: Alliance has salv so better faction for PvE
[1:19:51] brother_jays: everyone who mained horde in classic just wanted a change
[1:19:51] jeff6262: Alliance are sexier
[1:19:53] Murder_Inc: alot of peeople that mained horde last classic are trying something different
[1:19:55] lano_da_goat: they rerolled ally for pve, raids are tougher
[1:20:07] Litlerhc: Alliance has salv so better faction for PvE!
[1:20:21] Loctite: It is odd. I played Horde for years. But now I am Alliance.
[1:20:43] lano_da_goat: nope
[1:20:43] dantezalive: Most of the alliance arejust doing HC and not pvp
[1:20:46] Skycoh: the barrens is actually one of the fastest zones to level in. everything is so close. minimal travel.
[1:21:00] WayTooFeared: is this retail or classic?
[1:21:04] lano_da_goat: horde only turtled in og classic cuz they had long ques, now they will let ally rush drek since its faster honor/hr
[1:21:06] Litlerhc: Alliance has salv so better faction for PvE
[1:21:28] naviewer: From what I hear at 60 in my guild alliance can’t with AV
[1:21:29] Romanowski: R14 gear is better than MC. Why rush to 60?
[1:21:31] mflipsidetv: ive noticed 10x more good players on SoM alliance then I did when I was playing normal classic
[1:21:31] Galdrena: Season of Mastery @WayTooFeared
[1:21:40] Divinedreaming: it was the world buff change that made guilds want to go allie this time around
