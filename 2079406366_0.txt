[0:03:12] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Hey Max, I love monks. Do you think that we're likely to actually see a rework of the class pre-war within, or should we expect to keep the same talent trees going into war within and just have thing piled on top of them with the hero specs?
[0:04:02] stando96_: does liquid start one day ahead  here too? else they won't be able to win :) :) echo fanboy jk love liquid

[0:16:55] johanoxd: I think whaazz said they're playing on 180 ping or something
[0:16:57] Viisionz74: Imagine the RWF on EU ping first 3 days and last 3 days US ping
[0:16:57] zerossussy: and most rogues are outlaw
[0:16:59] Viisionz74: so much drama
[0:17:01] dknamey: play on oce

[0:18:21] luixun: blizzard small indie corp not possible for them to set up a pvp server where all have the same "good/shit" ping at the same time

[0:22:58] Zacaree55: Supposedly Jelly was having some issues IRL, and he got upset with his team and they werent too happy with him and didnt want to be the outlet of his personal issues. So I think they separated from him and he took it badly. But this is all from Jelly's PoV/Stream @Maximum

[0:23:55] BigBadAzz1: No way?
[0:24:20] QuishCZ: Why no liquid MDI team?
[0:24:24] mybootyisasnack: if you watch his most recent at around the 4min mark he calls them beta males and starts talking shit
[0:24:32] Zacaree55: I just hope for the best and maybe some reconciling can happen down the line. But currently he's off the team and they are running a 3 man roster.
[0:24:32] kursewalker: Have you ever had to like boot someone out of the guild?
[0:24:45] zerossussy: AINTNOWAY
[0:24:46] shinta__: that's why we barely get to see Mes?
[0:24:54] majestictaco0: as soon as you call someone a beta you're def wrong lmao
[0:24:59] athcoids: one hundo p
[0:25:00] thiccsushi: AINTNOWAY
[0:25:14] Zacaree55: @shinta__ Mes just doesnt play because he understands that sometimes riding the pine is better for winning.
[0:25:17] brokik1: im shocked because high level wow pvp usually attracts really stable and chill people
[0:25:21] Zacaree55: But if DK was good. Mes would be in.
[0:25:26] jimtheplumber207: s
[0:25:27] PyroRage: @Maximum they have been playing together as 4 since like 2018. so prob just a temporary disagreement
[0:25:35] shinta__: @Zacaree55 true
[0:25:44] JackOfAllApocalypses: yeah it's definitely a "how to say you're in the wrong w/out saying your in the wrong"...I mean, people go through shit and it can be hard, but that doesn't justify that kind of shit
[0:26:05] Viisionz74: No
[0:26:09] Viisionz74: Its not per round for ping
[0:26:14] Viisionz74: its per match
[0:26:36] shinta__: I play 80 all the time
[0:26:43] Flipeled: no shot it's per match
[0:26:44] gorgorz0rt: gorgorz0rt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 123
[0:26:48] malakin_cr: not true, they switch per round
[0:26:51] Flipeled: one team would be perma fucked
[0:26:53] TheAngryChicken16: its loser ping
[0:26:53] Dberjerak823: Ot
[0:26:58] shinta__: they can't do per mathc, that is awful
[0:27:02] Tfeazy: I thought I read it was per round
[0:27:02] MrDread: im about to just start making shit up
[0:27:03] Rain0x1: When is season 4 coming out Max, Wow is so deed rn
[0:27:05] malakin_cr: they said it on stream
[0:27:05] Dberjerak823: It's definitely per round they said it at the top of the day
[0:27:06] malakin_cr: the caster
[0:27:08] Viisionz74: idk man
[0:27:13] Tfeazy: err match
[0:27:16] Tfeazy: I'm dumb
[0:27:17] Viisionz74: i swore i heard pika say it was per match
[0:27:23] kursewalker: it's per round
[0:27:35] MrDread: it is per match if you win every game GIGACHAD
[0:27:39] jimtheplumber207: flexin
[0:27:39] wowtrucker: Nah loser gets to pick Arena and the next match is on their server. The loser gets the better ping in the next match
[0:27:45] AingealanLann: Losers get map pick, counter comp, and ping. Every map.
[0:27:45] RaccoonJS: Im a genius, i can tell you they are just playing right now :)
[0:27:46] dknamey: Its per gard
[0:28:00] JonBarackSnow: it switches every two minutes
[0:28:02] Havocados: per you
[0:28:12] Flipeled: Raiku GIGACHAD
[0:28:18] Esotraz: this is the matchup echo was hoping for
[0:28:19] Esotraz: in game 1
[0:28:22] guynormally: most have been slow
[0:28:25] shinta__: Liquid matches were hype af
[0:28:28] dknamey: What happened
[0:28:32] hauswas: whazz has entered the chat
[0:28:33] Zacaree55: Ye games are pretty fast. Then you have Trill, Dew, Sam prolonging games KEKW
[0:28:34] Blurstinger: this ping thing is awful, how is this called "competitive" lol
[0:28:37] JackOfAllApocalypses: demon hunters apparently just destroy in pvp
[0:28:44] MrDread: They roll a die every 30 seconds. If it lands on odd it is EU, if it lands on even it is US
[0:28:49] zerossussy: thats true
[0:28:50] Zolshy89: not true
[0:28:51] Esotraz: depends on clalss
[0:28:55] shinta__: wow handles latency impressively well
[0:29:05] zerossussy: i play 100 ms and im sure it isn't affecting me
[0:29:19] Blurstinger: totally unfair...
[0:29:25] bByxinnOceNzz: i play 160 and i can feel it but it's not that big
[0:29:36] malakin_cr: Argentina plays with like perma 240 LUL
[0:29:36] Zacaree55: @Maximum When i was playing Oceanic from my days as a night owl. Playing on Oceanic servers vs playing on CST servers was a massive difference KEKW
[0:29:45] Iridiumspx: it makes no sense that the NA tournament servers are west coast instead of east coast
[0:29:56] johanoxd: I thought it was west coast servers
[0:30:00] Kyocere: back in my day we all played shooters with 300 ping and no one complained
[0:30:02] luixun: when the eu server is frankfurt germany i would have a 1ms ping against ppl with 200-240
[0:30:11] rixbur: The default game input latency is 200ms. Which is why you can que spells.  I usually set that to 100ms for responsive input.
[0:30:35] BehanceTV: better internet ug
[0:30:37] Qoning: that doesnt make sense, ping is there and back
[0:30:42] hauswas: still cool you can press this many buttons at a high level across water
[0:30:59] Tooyoo: @Qoning it's b/c they dont take the same route
[0:31:02] Tooyoo: it makes perfect sense
[0:31:08] guynormally: @rixbur default is 400, i believe
[0:31:21] Qoning: well yeah but then that's up to which provider you choose
[0:31:22] jaco163: chat has no idea what routing is
[0:31:28] danimal513: their latency is calculated in Celsius
[0:31:38] cyapat1: Default is 400
[0:31:41] cyapat1: YEP
[0:31:45] Flipeled: 400 is the max, 200 is default I think
[0:31:50] Thdlock: and 400 is very bad with high haste
[0:31:53] recognizex: what option?
[0:31:55] shinta__: is tath real? wtf
[0:31:58] Thdlock: drop that shit to like 200 max xdd
[0:31:59] gonzobone: gonzobone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! ah that's why i'm a shitter all the input lag definitely
[0:32:01] ShaggySummers: @jaco163 intercontinental connections barely are up to your carrier, unless they use a distinct pearing server
[0:32:34] BugattiNugatti: Vi kan kjøpe hele sverige
[0:32:34] rixbur: @Thdlock Yeah you can't cancel spell which is already in que :D
[0:32:43] wikiwa1: the viking diff?
[0:32:51] zerossussy: spell queue is 100% default at 400
[0:32:52] recognizex: @Maximum What ms should I set it to?
[0:32:54] Fredo90i: which script
[0:32:54] LucasSterling_: think scandinavia has among best internet in world
[0:32:58] TheoDeri: u mean centimeters?
[0:33:00] bByxinnOceNzz: yea its default 400 for sure
[0:33:00] 1cashews1: do you have the skript ?
[0:33:32] guynormally: that's a match
[0:33:36] Pygsystim: no
[0:33:39] Centriuzz: Nono
[0:33:41] Flipeled: that's a match
[0:33:42] richyvee: @recognizex gotta figure it out for yourself, start with 200
[0:33:45] Iridiumspx: well those 2 teams are both EU
[0:33:47] richyvee: and go lower maybe
[0:33:48] guynormally: there are 3-5 rounds per match
[0:33:50] Iridiumspx: so it doesnt matter in this match
[0:33:52] dknamey: Idk
[0:33:57] Blurstinger: 200ms is the average human reaction speed, why would you play a "competitive" game with 200+ ping on top of your reaction speed xD it makes no sense, this is why I love Riot, they always care about ping...
[0:33:58] zerossussy: heres the command to set ur spell queue: /console SpellQueueWindow 200 (default is 400)
[0:34:11] zerossussy: to check ur spell queue type this /dump GetCVar("SpellQueueWindow")
[0:34:25] Dberjerak823: I got lost in the round/match terminology tbh, ty for saying map lol
[0:34:38] Teeemosh: 400 enjoyers BasedGod
[0:34:45] Qoning: there are classes where more can be better
[0:34:46] ajzamo: ElvUI or some other addon must change it during install because I've never set that in my life and mine is 50
[0:34:56] Zacaree55: @Maximum When Liquid plays Lava Lava. Because Liq is #1 seed. They get home field advantage. But if EU team loses. its EU ping for map 2. then vice versa. the higher seed team always gets 3 maps of home ping in a 5 game series.
[0:34:58] ajzamo: I know ElvUI changes some CVars during install
[0:35:00] vente97: reddit says ping+100 for melee
[0:35:00] Anarchypov: I also set it to my ping give or take like 10~
[0:35:13] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:35:21] papach0ng: Advancedinterfaceoptions add on is goated
[0:35:34] Esotraz: no
[0:35:35] Ancine: isnt this a dh thing?
[0:35:36] contraxis: @zerossussy what should it be set at mine has forever been 400 i believe lol
[0:35:37] slammedbk1: we want dh to get nerfed :)
[0:35:39] zerossussy: @vente97 for outlaw its abit sketchy to have it below 100
[0:35:41] slammedbk1: thats what we want :)
[0:35:42] Esotraz: i dont want melee cleaves
[0:35:42] Flipeled: fast no damp
[0:35:43] guynormally: the age old question :)
[0:35:45] Esotraz: fuck melee cleaves
[0:35:47] scuffes: burst no1 likes damp
[0:35:50] shinta__: fast
[0:35:50] Centriuzz: Somewhere in the middle probably
[0:35:53] Dnioyo: surely all pvpers agree :)
[0:35:56] SlowboLaggins: somewhere in between personally
[0:35:57] zerossussy: @contraxis put it to 200 and never think about it again
[0:36:00] Benji195: they complain about both lol
[0:36:00] Hammeredpine27: people like pvp?
[0:36:00] vente97: pvpers hate dh
[0:36:01] BipolarPongal: It's such a dogshit system either way. Why play competitive on bad ping

[0:36:13] GuapSama: negative healing atpRtsd
[0:36:16] contraxis: @zerossussy gotcha
[0:36:25] Flipeled: DH damage is insane
[0:36:27] guynormally: demon hunters xdding
[0:36:32] Zacaree55: We want DH's to get nerfed because they are oppressively strong right now. and the weaker classes/healers to be buffed to the classes that are the strongest currently. @Maximum
[0:36:33] shinta__: DH are hitting hard
[0:36:36] Blurstinger: Dampening demonstrates how bad is pvp design nowadays. just an awful mechanic
[0:36:39] AngelMtz_2904: Hi
[0:36:44] Flipeled: no, it was both DHs at the top
[0:36:54] Zacaree55: Except Fistweavers. Me and my homies hate Fistweavers.
[0:37:07] Zacaree55: Yea pretty much KEKW
[0:37:16] asd123qwerty1: @Maximum have u checked the trading post this month
[0:37:20] qt_girl_gamer: dhs arent op lol thats what low rating people say, they are mid to low tier at best
[0:37:21] hashtagyolo11: DH in pvp is not okay
[0:37:24] luixun: not gonna happen that all are balanced
[0:37:31] Docaan: i see ziqo mostly play classic, I am impressed by his retail knowledge
[0:37:33] Thdlock: check out my latest based take im ready to start wildfire
[0:37:35] Thdlock: baseg
[0:37:39] itsthelichqueen: hello, hello! :)
[0:37:43] Esotraz: healers should not be at the same power level when they all have something different
[0:37:54] zerossussy: thats true
[0:37:55] zerossussy: ya
[0:38:11] johanoxd: Voidgg played double dh earlier today
[0:38:17] Flipeled: @Thdlock that was definetely one of the takes of all time
[0:38:21] taanzfour: shadow was also strong enough before it got buffed, im not sure why theyd buff it
[0:38:33] scuffes: @taanzfour cause pve
[0:38:34] luixun: and second you cant balance each class to be good the same way thats not possible with the different classes
[0:38:41] BipolarPongal: @Thdlock based tweets as always. PVErs in shambles WideTHD
[0:38:45] wikiwa1: also small buffs dont work because of the time investment to swap, from what I understand
[0:38:50] fronkacean: ABOBA
[0:38:50] taanzfour: @scuffes im talking about pve specifically
[0:38:51] psokys: cant wait for mdi finals, we gonna see some crazy shit from teams
[0:38:59] Esotraz: CHANIMAL POGGERS
[0:39:06] shinta__: @Thdlock amazing take as always WideTHD
[0:39:53] Flipeled: it's the same situation as raid global release, just gotta accept it and play the game
[0:40:26] relentzxd: @Flipeled it's not the same
[0:40:31] Flipeled: losers don't pick ping
[0:40:35] Esotraz: this matchup is more enjoyable to watch imo less zugzug
[0:40:37] Flipeled: it's just swaps every round
[0:40:43] Dberjerak823: To be fair if they did it the other way almost every series would probably be 3-0
[0:40:49] Cap1che: aw man so if you get shit on multiple times then you REALLY got shit on
[0:40:49] polygoncoke: A washable hoodie thing?
[0:41:02] Flipeled: yes
[0:41:03] pettunix: yep
[0:41:06] Esotraz: map 1 3 5 same ping
[0:41:21] GameChampTCG: echo vs tensei is really the finals anyway, they are the 2 best teams imo
[0:41:23] Blurstinger: that sounds horrible XD
[0:41:47] Viisionz74: 5 GAMES
[0:41:55] shinta__: so lower seed gets fucked lol
[0:42:03] thiccsushi: Chatting chatters lied again
[0:42:05] longdongsilva35: first map higher seed
[0:42:07] Dnioyo: isnt wow so accessible :)
[0:42:11] longdongsilva35: then the looser gets better
[0:42:15] Pygsystim: like 90% sure it's supposed to swap per map
[0:42:16] zerossussy: Chatting twitch chat info
[0:42:29] Blurstinger: with that amount of money, Blizzard, a triple A company can't host a proper competitive game? what a joke
[0:42:38] Wopacha: if you lose a game , you get ping advantage
[0:42:50] Esotraz: LETSGO CHANIMALS
[0:42:51] Flipeled: @Wopacha it's not tied to lsing
[0:43:04] Flipeled: it swaps no matter who wins
[0:43:27] pettunix: you need to understand if this games were in the eu pvp servers chibaku beat and eliminate echo this year in cups
[0:43:38] Zacaree55: @Maximum Sent you something in discord from their livestream from earlier KEKW
[0:43:41] Zacaree55: To stop all the confusion
[0:44:26] Zacaree55: If we have a LAN
[0:44:27] Esotraz: dont think thats comfirmed yet
[0:44:27] Zacaree55: But yea
[0:44:34] popo_wow: theres not gonna be season 4 in DF
[0:44:43] TheAngryChicken16: @popo_wow ?
[0:44:44] popo_wow: AWC i mean
[0:44:44] Roine: Leaked PauseChamp
[0:44:49] Zacaree55: Global finals may still be online NA vs NA finals and EU vs EU finals.
[0:44:55] ArcaneSyntax: I'm only gonna root for teams that use a ret paladin.
[0:44:55] BipolarPongal: Merce o7
[0:44:58] hughbearr: Does Chanimal still play from Australia?
[0:45:06] Roine: @hughbearr he lives in france
[0:45:08] Esotraz: @hughbearr france
[0:45:11] slammedbk1: wow its double lock double dh :) surely itll get nerfed next week :)
[0:45:22] Esotraz: and double shaman :)
[0:45:26] divine_killjaeden: 331k death sweep
[0:45:35] divine_killjaeden: no nerft needed
[0:45:51] Zacaree55: @slammedbk1 Thats because this is EU meta.
[0:45:56] fillefaren: Any plans on playing last epoch? @Maximum
[0:46:00] Zacaree55: Lock/DH is the current EU meta.
[0:46:00] ciecie29: hello friends how goes it
[0:46:04] slammedbk1: 🤡
[0:46:10] realsolah: channMalding
[0:46:18] Zacaree55: I love how hyped Ven and Ziqo get while casting @Maximum
[0:46:22] jimtheplumber207: lol
[0:46:24] Esotraz: channMalding
[0:46:27] Flipeled: Liquid vs Echo inc?
[0:46:30] progonitelj: xD
[0:46:36] Vramii: I mean liquid echo finals has to happen
[0:46:42] Seventhedeadly: TL vs Echo yet again...
[0:46:46] johanoxd: Its west coast na i think
[0:46:59] LucasSterling_: they need to be canada

[0:48:44] HavingFunWrong: you guys have a team competing in this ?? @Maximum
[0:48:47] Esotraz: clipped
[0:48:49] Esotraz: out of context thank u
[0:48:58] eneyeseakaywhy20: wait you like the move?
[0:49:00] eneyeseakaywhy20: W
[0:49:02] Zacaree55: @Maximum Its actually essential that Liquid keeps winning out. I think they will have the highest seed advantage unless Chibaku pulls an upset in the lower fanbase.
[0:49:06] starcraft_t_v: what fan stuff?
[0:49:08] vente97: dawg?
[0:49:09] cheese_beaver: HUH wdym

[0:49:20] Esotraz: @BipolarPongal literally the same in all esports
[0:49:21] fronkacean: streamer made in a lab that guy
[0:49:22] Zacaree55: lower fanbasew
[0:49:25] Zacaree55: I meant lower bracket.
[0:49:26] Vramii: I mean - the new healer is not as good as the old one and people are calling it out - but I don’t think it’s been anything weird.
[0:49:26] Zacaree55: God
[0:49:31] eneyeseakaywhy20: I went to college with pika
[0:49:36] Sheepywow: the BEENZ
[0:49:36] Ignite_CLO: pika is also an ex team mate of steph curry
[0:49:37] lathander557: wait who's dealing with fan stuff again? echo?
[0:49:44] longdongsilva35: look cdew and raiku drama on twitter haha
[0:49:46] jimtheplumber207: pika gang
[0:49:48] Ditysalad: Pika is one of the most entertaining streamers out there
[0:49:50] longdongsilva35: raiku such a cry baby
[0:49:53] divine_killjaeden: until the drama makes it weird.
[0:49:59] longdongsilva35: lontar
[0:50:04] regular_rusty: its just people hating on lontar
[0:50:04] Esotraz: people were giving the new healer (lontar) alot of shit
[0:50:12] longdongsilva35: bc mehh was the better healer
[0:50:18] BipolarPongal: @Esotraz I tried RBG for a few months, had the worst experience. I'd take PvE any day. Maybe it's just me
[0:50:36] SL_Nerf_Herder: people hating on the top is always gunna happen
[0:50:37] regular_rusty: their old healer isnt allowed to play i thought?
[0:50:37] Cap1che: max we meet very briefly at blizzcon in the sheraton on the last day. I shouted your name as you walked in and you looked very surprised but still came to say hi. I might have been a little intoxicated but thanks for coming over!
[0:50:38] blacklotusc: why did he quit
[0:50:39] lathander557: well that's cringe
[0:50:44] Esotraz: @BipolarPongal rbg is a whole other level of weird but its legit the same in all comp chats
[0:50:53] LIZARD_Monukuma: i mean if one quit and they dont like the new one, the alternative would be no healer? xd
[0:50:59] Vramii: how is it weird for fans to say new healer isn’t playing as well? their old healer way playing better. this guy struggled a bit but seems to be getting his footing now.

[0:54:54] lathander557: They went through a rough PR patch
[0:54:57] vente97: is he not cancelled anymore=
[0:55:14] alexchopstix: yeah he auctioned off some companies prototype water cooler for GPU
[0:55:20] jaco163: your face is cancelled
[0:55:22] lathander557: They basically moved on like it never happened and feels like they're just rugsweeping
[0:55:26] Ignite_CLO: @Vramii 1) most "fans" dont know jack shit about arena trying to tell a multi rank1 healer he is bad 2) there is levels to critisism and perma harrassing someone simply for not bein mehh is indeed very weired. hope this helps
[0:55:30] jimtheplumber207: a bullet?

[1:00:29] Karaelolz: good dam and massive healing
[1:00:30] fdb33: ya more dmg but squishier
[1:00:32] Vramii: yes big offensive healer

[1:00:43] Lothland: Their firebreath will remove all the druids hots
[1:00:44] JackOfAllApocalypses: yeah, and breath dispel is brutal vs druids
[1:00:46] Zacaree55: like 100k Disinegrates @Maximum with good healing. But they can die in a stun super hard.
[1:00:47] SlowboLaggins: its good into rdruid to dispell hots
[1:00:47] Esotraz: fire breath purges , offensive healer
[1:00:49] Windnecro: pres is the risk reward big offense option usually

[1:01:39] zenruso_: supatease is going hard on the cast
[1:01:40] Seventhedeadly: Trill is just insane
[1:01:45] Zacaree55: @Maximum If Evoker doesnt have trink they still have a save during stun with communion
[1:01:46] shoneshaman: cdew has EC
[1:01:53] thatoneguynobodylikes352: All of their damage comes from a single combo, which lets them dump on people with damage while spending GCDs for healing. And a lot of their healing is without cast time, so they can use their insane mobility to kite while throwing snap healing.
[1:01:55] divine_killjaeden: he has the pve rotation on
[1:01:58] hotdogmartyr: no hes fine
[1:02:01] DanCr0w: emerald communion hes fine

[1:03:04] pettunix: rogue and healer are dependble of
[1:03:06] pettunix: ping
[1:03:07] nexten_: Dh is ping dependent
[1:03:11] Rhop: DH with high ping is rough
[1:03:12] Stahn1993: chat or max, are the arena liquid guys also on the raid roster?
[1:03:13] Ignite_CLO: usually ranged dps deal better with high ping. melees especially rogue sucks
[1:03:20] Esotraz: dh ping is mostly rough defensivly
[1:03:33] Zacaree55: @Maximum Good thing about Dew. He's probably the best preservation in the world as much as the best shaman. So when he's down and out of defensives on pres. He'll still be able to get out of danger. Ideally.
[1:03:36] madtrade2600: trill is really the best wow player
[1:03:38] regular_rusty: trill benched
[1:03:45] Paandamonk1: why doesnt trill play anymore?
[1:03:48] JackOfAllApocalypses: turns out trill's pretty good at damage

[1:04:00] waldoishere: If trill wanted to come back would you let him @maximum

[1:04:02] Karaelolz: I fucking love it when the dew busts out the pres
[1:04:05] shoneshaman: the best part about trill is the fact that he is also into wow lore as well
[1:04:06] Esotraz: rdruid nto exactly known for damage in arenas LUL

[1:04:28] larkhill: i dont think theyve ever mentioned it
[1:04:30] Seventhedeadly: I love they were able to play lan together.. I think that's making a huge differnce..
[1:04:31] SILMAMIES: they pretend it doesnt matter
[1:04:31] jaco163: ye he does sound like tettles
[1:04:33] GoldenA_: ven talked about it earlier
[1:04:33] duckdaring: They talked about it earlier
[1:04:35] Rhop: Trill just stopped raiding because he couldn't commit to both AWC & RWF right?
[1:04:35] pettunix: they never mention the ping advantage
[1:04:37] ciecie29: id din't even know ping was an issue im new to this
[1:04:38] redstick1: they're probably not allowed to because it impacts competitive integrity
[1:04:41] Karaelolz: loser always has the ping advantage right?
[1:04:42] jixxuh: P sure losing team gets ping advantage
[1:04:42] Vramii: I mean it rotates
[1:04:47] Vramii: liquid has advantage first
[1:04:48] Dberjerak823: They have earlier in the day but I guess they dont have the technology to change their UI for this tourney
[1:04:51] Vramii: ow lava lava
[1:04:53] Vramii: then liquid
[1:04:54] Vramii: etc
[1:04:54] pettunix: because blizzard dont want to know
[1:04:56] divine_killjaeden: pvpers ignore the ping
[1:05:00] SlowboLaggins: i noticed a mod saying it in chat earlier but thats about it
[1:05:06] OlsargeTV: not built into their template?
[1:05:17] Esotraz: there he mentioned EU @Maximum
[1:05:20] vente97: template made for lan
[1:05:23] lathander557: chat

[1:05:55] Marsbar006: Do you think pick and ban style could be cool for PvP?

[1:06:09] regular_rusty: ele slams damage
[1:06:18] Zacaree55: Guzz knows how to blast as ele. Probably arguably the best ele in the world
[1:06:21] turd_master_69: max u should climb to elite in shuffle on ur DH :D
[1:06:22] jaco163: just like on live kek
[1:06:23] Dnioyo: eles are super unpopular on NA for some inexplicable reason
[1:06:27] divine_killjaeden: dh ele should win. The dh will pump.
[1:06:28] pettunix: guzz is a rly good shaman  and ele slams so much dmg atm if you dont know how to counter it
[1:06:40] Cruzerio: @Zacaree55 Probably arguably xdd
[1:06:42] spenseb: is this bo5?
[1:06:49] Zacaree55: @Cruzerio Smexxin Ele EZ Clap
[1:06:51] lathander557: Liquid getting game 1 is yuge
[1:06:53] Karaelolz: pres usually only does bad against rogues, I believe
[1:06:55] ZombFeed: @Marsbar006 severely disadvantages most teams, makes practice and prep annoying
[1:07:12] Esotraz: ye but its also blindpick
[1:07:20] DanFromBackHome: Adge
[1:07:24] Esotraz: but if u lose with ping adv ur kinda in a rough spot
[1:07:38] Ataktoss: DH ele will have so much dps monkaS
[1:07:45] ddlrr: are the boys at Liquid Home base?
[1:07:48] divine_killjaeden: if Na wins eu is gonna cry ping advantage.
[1:08:08] khaste_G: is ping advantage really a big difference? monkaHmm
[1:08:15] Marsbar006: @ZombFeed Would just require teams to have a much deeper bag
[1:08:24] leeVade: lets go
[1:08:28] Karaelolz: ye he thinks the same now
[1:08:36] Pellevi: echo's previous healer (meh) loved evoker too
[1:08:39] ufwcode: max remember your mythic rasz in 2024 video im in a group with laylay the tank doing mythic gnarl LOL
[1:08:41] Lothland: It's because there isn't any ele players
[1:08:45] ZombFeed: @Marsbar006 sure, teams need a bigger bag already. but its just another unecessary layer
[1:08:48] Scaleta: ttOURS
[1:08:50] Karaelolz: your cam blocks Dew's health bar
[1:08:53] ciecie29: east coast best coast
[1:08:57] jixxuh: cant see cdews health
[1:08:57] Esotraz: EU have like 4-5 main ele's dont think na has any ''main eles'' that i can think of
[1:09:02] Afrothunder31: @Maximum Have you seen Dune yet?
[1:09:03] jixxuh: <3
[1:09:03] GameChampTCG: tr is east coast
[1:09:15] goesidd: east coast has better to ping to eu and na ping
[1:09:36] Esotraz: its also nice to play on same ping
[1:09:40] GameChampTCG: east coast is better for TR from what i have read
[1:09:42] goesidd: tr is not east coast
[1:09:47] Anarchypov: its not east coast
[1:09:56] goesidd: @GameChampTCG then u gotta reread
[1:10:03] Zacaree55: Nope
[1:10:04] GameChampTCG: i meant to say TR is better to play on East coast
[1:10:05] Zacaree55: Its JOEVER
[1:10:10] GameChampTCG: for this event

[1:10:24] ruediruempel: does this even make a difference? for me i cant tell if i have 20 or 40 ms maybe its for pro a difference
[1:10:33] tinyjr: ping diff
[1:10:36] Ataktoss: They got dark and borrow from 1 go might be game
[1:10:38] goesidd: @GameChampTCG thats not what u said
[1:10:40] Stahn1993: my brain really isnt big enough to really grasp pvp
[1:10:41] Zacaree55: Lava Lava committed alot in that exchange @Maximum
[1:10:55] duckdaring: lol world first kick on samiyam by coffey
[1:10:58] Zacaree55: But they have alot rolling back up.
[1:11:11] Karaelolz: this Dr stun from coffey was bad
[1:11:26] Malicone: wow close
[1:11:30] DanCr0w: look at mana tho its almost even
[1:11:33] Zacaree55: They are denying the DH so much. and he's still topping dam KEKW
[1:11:35] inordinator: well since it seems like its going to end in liquid vs eu, east coast was prolly the right call
[1:11:46] Ataktoss: Trill is so annoying on outlaw holy
[1:11:49] Zacaree55: Hes runnign Incarn

[1:16:27] Dberjerak823: That was nutty
[1:16:28] regular_rusty: eu ping
[1:16:34] Sheepywow: those drinks were the difference
[1:16:34] DanCr0w: good ass game tho
[1:16:35] b1det: crazy match
[1:16:38] Cafe0le: @fronkacean KEKW
[1:16:40] Thasin22: This game makes no sense
[1:16:43] sednajoan: Wow...
[1:16:49] Zacaree55: If they would have stopped the drinks. it was Joever.
[1:16:52] WingsOfDoug: i have no idea how pvp works, i realize this more and more as I watch this
[1:16:56] ciecie29: i like that it's more close now tho
[1:17:03] TeamLiquid: Interested in purchasing a Mythic Amirdrassil, the Dreams Hope boost with Team Liquid? Head over to go.adv.gg/4XuCPI for pricing and to schedule a run! (Gold Only)
[1:17:08] nyshindysheen: lmao
[1:17:13] goesidd: bo5
[1:17:14] shameshady: look at that ele dmg
[1:17:19] turd_master_69: @WingsOfDoug kill enemy win
[1:17:20] Geddaa1: Did trill swap to pvp over pve or did he get the boot xD ?
[1:17:22] a_cuddly_cow: @Maximum have you followed the GW2 RWF happening right now? It's insanely hype
[1:17:23] nairb1: are we gonna see some chair punching
[1:17:31] Malicone: would be nice if you cant drink in arena. It is fair!
[1:17:41] Cafe0le: meld starsurges, nelf masterace
[1:17:44] mstr_shake: cdew healing is insane
[1:17:47] Zacaree55: @Maximum Gotta stop them drinks and its joever. They'll adapt for the next games.
[1:17:58] lacusdark: heartbreaking for liquid
[1:18:01] subbby: @Geddaa1 Trill that good he does both
[1:18:21] ciecie29: LOL
[1:18:32] lacusdark: max will trill be on the roster for next rwf ?
[1:18:33] based_takes: gw2 EleGiggle
[1:18:52] turd_master_69: the quality of players in gw2 would equal an LFR in wow
[1:19:06] JonatanXaD: @Maximum we're watching wow 3v3 pvps, there's no way we understand anything that's on the screen, this singular fight had 4 mminutes where both healers were oom and no one died lol
[1:19:13] a_cuddly_cow: That specific wipe is more about how to make it less likely that someone wasn't moving to the right place. It is more analogous to tswift seeds
[1:19:16] xxMaverick: no even if you don't understand you just throw some insane chats out there and roll with it
[1:19:16] shameshady: Trill used to do MDI, AWC and RWF, but had to prioritize AWC and RWF, now he is only doing AWC
[1:19:38] mstr_shake: @JonatanXaD they weren't actually oom tho, just low mana until the very end for cdew
[1:20:02] thatoneguynobodylikes352: The big thing is when you don't understand things you choose to be wrong loudly.
[1:20:02] Esotraz: Biggest Map
[1:20:23] Esotraz: And liquid has a harder time stopping drinks
[1:20:27] goesidd: @JonatanXaD the druid shadowmeld drank and the evoker regens mana from disintegrate and communion
[1:20:37] Esotraz: They mentioned EU ping for game 2
[1:20:42] Zacaree55: Stop the drinks and its joever.
[1:20:51] Zacaree55: Adapt. Survive. Overcome.
[1:20:52] thunder993: Not sure how much ping difference it is?
[1:20:56] BigTrout3: NA Cheergi
[1:20:56] JonatanXaD: dex was oom way before cdew and the fight continued for 4m
[1:21:03] JonatanXaD: @goesidd oh that makes sense

[1:22:30] ciecie29: mortal morning drinkim
[1:22:38] auby6: @Maximum do you think ele is so bad in pve bc blizzard balances them as pvp only spec?
[1:23:01] Vigilnace: could complexity force you to make a mdi team?
[1:23:10] Esotraz: Yes crazy
[1:23:13] Zacaree55: Guz can die here
[1:23:13] ciecie29: good try max
[1:23:16] Zacaree55: Nvm
[1:23:16] JonatanXaD: @Maximum What does firedup does on his freetime?
[1:23:18] taanzfour: could you be further off
[1:23:21] SpeedyMcD: @auby6 it’s definitely q factor. ele is really really good in pvp but average and mediocre in pve
[1:23:25] Zacaree55: Dex dead.

[1:46:13] forshard: bro you ever heard of a pve only modifier? or tier sets that are between 15-50% as effective in pve?
[1:46:15] 101Leet: Pvp is frustrating because I have to constantly turn down the dozens of fine women reaching out on DMS
[1:46:17] PeezyOG: PVP players are going WILD over SoD getting tuning

[1:47:03] auby6: @101Leet think of all the headaches u wont have tho
[1:47:18] based_takes: there was a time where the lead pvp designer (holinka) quit and they never revealed publicy who the new one was becuase they were scared he'd be flamed for the state of the game
[1:47:20] forshard: @goesidd and then quit PepeHands
[1:47:22] vente97: had to unsub from the pvp reddit cause there was nonstop malding about dh cluttering my feed

[1:47:45] teeths121: what’s the ping in Team liquid land space against the EU teams?
[1:47:45] Milanesa_De_Pollo: That's what happens when you relase a solo queue mode almost 20 years after game release KEKW
[1:47:46] LocoBandito96: i wish they would reward m+ more
[1:47:50] Vramii: it was honestly a little better when there was some pve benefit to doing pvp
[1:47:52] caveman2x: the problem is the casual pvp space is non existance either sweat or suffer
[1:48:00] Cafe0le: arena is addicting in a mashochist way

[1:50:37] jimtheplumber207: trill is slappin people and takin their lunches for sure
[1:50:38] Windnecro: @based_takes ok so this is a take, stat templates is definitely less fun because you cant decide if you wanna stack w/e stat. but you also have to remember pvp talents required you to grind honor level, then if you wanted the cosmetic rewards you had to prestige and lose access to all those pvp talents, so you could either have the talents and do pvp or work towards the reward track they added for casual pvp
[1:50:38] atomicwaffleks: trill stole my bike
[1:50:39] McGovy: probably carrying a hammer at all times

[2:21:15] lessahj: 100%.
[2:21:15] BigBiffyB: Meanwhile Ion's entire career is from saying a boss was mathematically impossible :thinker:
[2:21:16] Serzus: is this aliexpress wow?
[2:21:17] Icydeadppl23: only time things were unkillable is when the mechanics were bugged lol
[2:21:36] nickelvc: birthday problem: how many people do you need to get into a room to have a 50/50 that two of them with the same birthday? used to illustrate that people don’t have a good intuition for probability (the answer is like 30)
[2:21:43] mangotangodown66: you should gear up and show him its possible xd
[2:21:50] BigTrout3: @nickelvc 23
[2:22:03] Drax_1224: did u guess it wouldvebeen a 1500 pull boss
[2:22:08] nickelvc: @bigtrout3 thank you
[2:22:19] BigTrout3: o7
[2:22:23] Docaan: @nickelvc PTSD
[2:22:24] Drax_1224: i think u said something like that around the race didnt u?
[2:22:28] Zixx: @Maximum have you watched some of the Cerus CM pulls?
[2:22:32] Boreall: I just hopped into Stream, how are we enjoying the Guild Wars 2 stream?
[2:22:37] BigLarryWithThaGarry: Johnny blizzard and the share holders clear every mythic boss before release. so It's been killed.
[2:22:42] Drax_1224: low end monkaW
[2:22:47] Aqinog: PTSD²
[2:23:03] sheckles: Clueless
[2:23:11] Theblueninjashen: @Maximum SC guild put that boss around 7% multiple times and they also use a different strategy.
[2:23:12] sheckles: he thinks we arent still getting 30 second wipes on tindral prog
[2:23:14] AesirQc: 30 sec wipe we just killed it with my guild and took us about 150 to learn p1-p2
[2:23:22] Boreall: Would 1500 pulls on it take like a month?
[2:23:25] ToxicLG: Skyline 3000 pulls monkaW
[2:23:25] Eskimo0_lol: Skyline pullcounter prenerf monkaW
[2:23:45] zenkodac: For sure those forst 50 to 100 pulls on tindral go fast af cus you just wipe in p1 so fast 1 min in
[2:23:53] zenkodac: First*
[2:24:00] forshard: max casually just missed the move
[2:24:07] nickelvc: the rock lee of guilds
[2:24:11] goesidd: skyline had reset on thursday tho so they did 2 more days on tindral with old gear, they didnt have that many pulls after reset
[2:24:12] BigFatAnimal: is he doing more pulls tonight or are they done
[2:24:23] inordinator: ive always wonder do wow devs design mechanics to be solved a specific way
[2:24:25] Drax_1224: well i think the nature of Tindral inflates pull counts because you get a lot of random p1/p2 wipes after youve already progged those phases right?
[2:24:25] Zlynnt: KEKW TRUE
[2:25:00] alexbtwbtwbtw: @Maximum the biggest problem with gw2 is there's just not enough content for people to get really good at the game / not get bored.
[2:25:04] 0rektquiem: @BigFatAnimal theyre done i think, theyve been at it for 11 hours lol
[2:25:05] Jumanjiqt: Your tindral start was rough though right since the whole game froze
[2:25:17] Theblueninjashen: the team that lead is going blind
[2:25:18] Jumanjiqt: the whole server was bricked during it
[2:25:27] isFeyz: this is the case for everything, everyone is confidently incorrect all the time.
[2:25:28] Ditysalad: tournament realm race now
[2:25:33] Arisolo: you pulled an unkillable boss for a while
[2:25:40] Angeels: it also reallyd epends how you pull the boss if you chain pull, reset on death in p1, etc. its such an irrelevant stat
[2:25:42] elsnickito: isnt that a problem fixed by having both teams in same timezone?
[2:25:48] Arisolo: the only fair statement is echo outplayed p3 on fyrakk
[2:25:48] itsgamz: @Arisolo no boss is unkillable amen
[2:25:49] dango0n: balatro
[2:25:49] WingedChipmunk: @Maximum not to mention i feel that Liquid excels at trial and error pulls while method takes time to discuss their plans in between pulls
[2:25:55] isFeyz: Helldivers with the boys? PauseChamp
[2:25:56] Jumanjiqt: I really like your teams commitment to pulling though and sticking it out
[2:25:57] AesirQc: Helldiver 2 ?
[2:25:57] yama_class: just go for it, have fun
[2:25:59] Shirey12: Last Epoch?
[2:26:00] moash_: @Angeels How close to Fyrakk are you guys now?
[2:26:01] Jumanjiqt: It's really respectable
[2:26:03] Clush___: @Maximum did u ever read/react to that one reddit post bitching about mythic raid
[2:26:04] Icydeadppl23: hockey stream when?
[2:26:13] Cower311: @Shirey12 dead game
[2:26:16] Docaan: would u recommend FF7 for non-FF fan?
[2:26:21] Ditysalad: any idea on the copies sold for FF7 Rebirth?
[2:26:24] brosciencegym: @Maximum  so grom did one bosss nerfed hard and we saw some entertainment
[2:26:44] xxMaverick: the most insane race i've ever seen no contest
[2:26:46] Angeels: @moash_ 55%
[2:27:00] GameChampTCG: the big thing was the colossus right? they had a diff strat
[2:27:02] Boreall: Do invidiual players ever put too much punishment on themselves for individual mistakes, or does everybody typically have that "Shit happens we get better we move on and kill it" attitude
[2:27:54] GameChampTCG: was the best final boss rwf imo
[2:27:55] Arisolo: @Maximum if you could clone firedup 19 times, how much faster would you clear the rai d
[2:27:57] GameChampTCG: so crazy
[2:28:22] menzlo: look at tettles' hair rn
[2:28:46] Ditysalad: no PC release is the only criticism
[2:28:59] mab_music_ttrpg: ff7 has a harder mode but you need to finish the game before you can do it
[2:29:07] Arisolo: @GameChampTCG my favourite RWF moment was on n'zoth when they reached the secret mythic phase. also when they realized they could heal through the ramping damage and blizz had to despawn n'zoth
[2:29:12] erdls: i only like turn-based FF games
[2:29:32] psychopomp555: good luck in your games later
[2:29:41] Lara_TV_: Definitely
[2:29:49] spivet: I feel like that can work with a game thats like RE2, where you can beat it pretty quick and replay, but on a long RPG thats nuts
[2:29:54] mab_music_ttrpg: agreed, that would be nice to go hard mode for the get go
[2:29:57] Mystachi_: i have heard rebirth have dynamic difficulty toggle tho
[2:29:59] Boreall: Did you ever end up playing Bg3?
[2:30:07] AesirQc: yeah im the same i dont like NG+
[2:30:23] Altairian8: all dynamic difficulty does is scale enemies up to your level so you can't out-level the content
[2:30:25] darkness79317: I honestly did not care about ff16's lack of difficulty it was still one of if not the best game I had ever played
[2:30:28] Rhop: Gotta have that forced replayability
[2:30:34] Mystachi_: ah i see, might just be easy early maybe ye
[2:30:38] tigerslap_ow: ghost of tsushima
[2:30:54] isFeyz: Witcher 3 only game I NG+'d
[2:30:59] GameChampTCG: when liquid/limit got world first nzoth i know echo/method was in full shambles

[2:34:03] isFeyz: AAA games always overpromise and underdeliver. They do so much marketing that  expectations are always too high, so they always fail. Indie/small studio stuff is the opposite.
