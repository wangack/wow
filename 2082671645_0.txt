[1:59:29] senpai_trapp: get Graycen to give you a massage, surely
[1:59:29] provenance12: @Bean you're supposed to feel pressure on your muscles during exercise (sit ups pressure on your stomach). How building muscle works is you strain muscle, causing micro tears and then your body heals and your muscles grow back bigger. If you're not feeling something you're not working your muscles.
