[5:17:49] ownpay: @Nize2 because the pets got rebuffed and they'd be dq'd if they joined anyway
[5:17:51] tokyosneed: they didnt want to rematch over a pet buff they cannot remove, so they forfeited the rematch
[5:17:55] simzcsgo: 1271 - 1 because of a 30 stam buff.

[5:20:52] xswamps: @mavking239 I'm sure you can watch a vod or replay later if you missed it
[5:20:54] tigrero_o: ty skeram designed their whole strategy around a rule technicality... no sympothy for them being asked to rematch for breaking a different rule technicality... and they chose not to rematch

[5:22:03] Thurrak: yes there is a large delay
[5:22:03] SadBrian: @notbartuc they didnt join the rematch, they werent DQed, they forfieted
[5:22:04] dakyle420420: not everyone has 3 brokentooths

[5:47:07] cutemeatball_: Blame blizzard
[5:47:10] HungarianScubaDad: VC a bunch of crybabies and cheaters anyway
[5:47:11] tigrero_o: they added time limits to prevent hour long turtles, but it backfired and created a turtle meta. obviously they didn't intend that and once they change the rules to fix it, skeram are done
[5:47:13] loktarwarrior: blame the rules of the tournament, not ty skeram

[6:12:09] ZukoWC3: another exciting turt...? ResidentSleeper
[6:12:12] corki21: @Blameshiftxy every team has capped atleast 1 flag in this tourny other than ty skeram and omnivore
[6:12:20] emobrute: didntr think there was something more boring to watch then MLD... turns out i was wrong
[6:12:21] joegutterball: vc did play ty skeram
[6:12:28] Mojo5808: why are they turtling
[6:12:31] thigh_hive: maybe they shouldve brought an unbuffed pet :)
[6:12:33] seeturtz: VC BabyRage
[6:12:36] Honeycrispie: @Jemsic it's almost like VC cried for an hour to make it that way
[6:12:37] Blameshiftxy: @Viigal No one capped vs ty skeram ofc
[6:12:38] primusbutface: you can't actually win wsg in classic by 10 man turtling. the tourny needs rules against it next time. playing for the timer is not classic wsg
[6:12:39] loktarwarrior: ty skeram is the best NA team
[6:12:44] toxokin: 26 minutes or so, so far
[6:12:45] tokyosneed: i can send you the scoreboard if you like lol
[6:12:48] Deepweb: Skeram got DQ'd
[6:12:54] SpiritMedia: people are reporting VC for cheating
[6:13:00] Raizdoe2: has any game in the tournament been anything than 0-0 ? it seems impossible to recover a flag :x
[6:13:02] Michaell111: why are all of you crying for skeram? they played so boring
[6:13:05] High_Soylord_Soy: justice for ty skeram
[6:13:05] gucci_clone: ty skeram forgot it was capture the flag LUL
[6:13:07] Metarra: IF TY SKERAM BEAT VC, WHY DOES BRACKET SHOW VC WIN? I FEEL DECEIVED!
[6:13:15] corkster95: riveting

[6:13:26] irregulargm: Classic ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[6:13:27] fiskenlearning: @primusbutface ya no flag drop for 10 min, should mean middle fight to 1 man standing
[6:13:27] Honeycrispie: the pet has 30 stam buff BabyRage we couldn't possibly win BabyRage
[6:13:30] seeturtz: ty skeram was boring, but they still won lol

[6:13:52] CucumberSoup: what is this **** game
[6:13:52] fiskenlearning: @gucci_clone DQ'd`?
[6:13:59] Metarra: They should have been DQ'd the first time they tried the strat. NOT when they succeed against VC.
[6:14:02] High_Soylord_Soy: how is this anymore exciting than 9 brainlets ramming themselves into a wall
[6:14:08] fiskenlearning: @Viigal because it's weird losing on 300 hp on a pet ?
[6:14:09] IHSV420: o boy another 0-0
[6:14:11] yolo_brah: @seeturtz what did they win ? you have to cap 3 flag to win a bg
[6:14:19] High_Soylord_Soy: theres no pvp going on theyre just running away
[6:14:23] corkster95: classic pvp is so lit
[6:14:24] zzzDai: They didnt get DQ for turtle, they got DQ for world buff on pet then refusing the admin rematch
[6:14:27] FreezeMage_: noggenfogger should have been banned

[6:14:38] corki21: @fiskenlearning they didnt lose man, its been repeated, they forfeited

[6:14:58] iy0w: dq for a 300 hp pet buff that you cant even remove
[6:14:58] Cynergi_: snoozefestttttt
[6:14:58] Metarra: the rules say otherwise.. TY Skeram won every match ACCORDING TO THE RULES. Their strategy was ALLOWED to win against eveyone except VC.
[6:14:58] thigh_hive: noggenfogger makes the match awesome wym

[6:15:19] Zeracho: How do they protect against stream sniping?
[6:15:21] quickyxo: now whats more entertaining this sleeper fest or watching slipry run into a brick wall for 35 mins
[6:15:22] fiskenlearning: @Viigal they had won, so needing to rematch over a 300 hp on a pet, surely would feel like a lose and bias admins. i understand why they did not take a rematch on that
[6:15:22] yolo_brah: @seeturtz so your saying in a warsong gultch tournament you can win the tournament by not playing warsong gultch ?
[6:15:25] Honeycrispie: vc roofed LUL
[6:15:26] ediktgaming: some people are sore losers

[6:16:41] ellye24: I believe there was already a rematch because of world buff...so they didnt have
[6:16:43] EGGFROMNOST: just go to extra times instead of by damage
[6:16:44] corki21: vc also the only team to dispute the issue, thats on them to choose to do that.

[6:17:22] Valcorexd: @fiskenlearning never
[6:17:27] sinful474: LUL
[6:17:28] FreezeMage_: the rules gives no benefit of attacking the enemy FC because then you risk giving away killing blows. no wonder you have these slow def games
[6:17:31] Fizzrocket: @doctor4ir abusing bugs and clips arent really high skilled.
[6:17:36] yolo_brah: imagine if both team just afk in their base to not give hks ...

[6:19:22] Metarra: so VC is ok with disputing a small issue to win? If rules are rules why does VC have an illegal participant?

[6:19:45] corki21: thats something u ask an adminstrator of the tournamnet not twitch chat
[6:19:47] FreezeMage_: yes yogi
[6:19:48] Zhava: @meatpop_13 There's no statement on it because none of the other teams cared about a tiny buff on a pet that's unavoidable when buying consumes from the AH. There were buffs on enemy pets I was fighting on previous games. Our team never cared.
[6:19:51] fiskenlearning: @YogiCeCoki ya sadly
[6:19:55] joegutterball: why does anyone even care who won they're playing for seeding
[6:19:56] flenbober: send tournament website link?

[6:21:24] DonTheSavior: for the people saying vc is cheating, the team they were playing against (ty skeram) had illegal buffs on pets from the world that were banned for the tourny
[6:21:30] thigh_hive: prize pool not adjusted for inflation
[6:21:30] doctor4ir: @Hypelive yeah but this match we are watching now is for cash
[6:21:34] Fizzrocket: @doctor4ir people abused these clips 15 years ago, it's not rocket science. It's the stupidest thing, allowing molasses gameplay and rewarding it. No point attacking, since you risk giving away killing blows. Like are you high or just in denial?
[6:21:35] fraknie: I don't understand why they wouldn't just only do Arathi.
[6:21:37] Sanityquestioned: These games are never goig to end

[6:21:55] doctor4ir: @Hypelive so everyone played for 1st and 2nd place not just seeding
[6:21:58] fiskenlearning: @HideInYellow fear ward, vs 25% stun resistance / wotf / more dispell (shaman) ?
[6:21:58] meatpop_13: @dogwater69 multiple teams had a tiny unavoidable buff on their pet that cant be removed and pursists through death. VC lost to ty skeram and complained about the pet buff and got them dq'd

[6:28:08] meatpop_13: @Dyadx because they won. Sure it may not be my favourite style of game that blizz decided to run the tournament with, but they won it. DQ'ing them because of the colour of their shirt, because they have red hair, or some other insignificant reason is rediculous
[6:28:08] cutelilthot: classicmiLezx: wait wait wait... so the cheesey strat team got DQ'd becuase of a cheesey rule? XDXDXZD
[6:28:09] kgriefing: yesmaster is hands down best fc

[6:33:53] meatpop_13: the "rules violation" was a pet buff that cant be removed. Offering them a rematch that they would get DQ'd from if they join is just a DQ with extra steps

[6:38:17] nuckAU: a rematch was offered and they couldn't take it. not much more can be done.
[6:38:17] Yikes7050: this tourney is big meme. why would pet stam affect the outcome. they didnt have the advantage like that anyway.
[6:38:22] Lucky___Star: @meatpop_13 oh ok, thx
[6:38:23] itsdaymoney: you are responsible for pet buffs its in the ruleset

[6:39:25] quickyxo: pet buff caused VC to owN by skeram LUL
[6:39:27] itsdaymoney: it was the warlock pet so he couldve used another pet

[6:39:31] Yikes7050: and the pet stam was definitely something that wasn't used maliciously. This wasn't what made them win. Just grimey snakes backstabbing Ty Skeram.
