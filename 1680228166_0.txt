[0:17:56] Kneckt: @Cris_985 a lot of his UI is optional
[0:18:14] TheLowkeyPro: Talent system is new. Lvling system is tons easier

[5:53:11] Lintgamer: Is there a max ilvl cap that you get from rare drops?
[5:53:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is also usually a little rep item in a dirt mound/pack
[5:54:09] spookaninja_21: Okay thank you
[5:55:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The dirt and packs are unlimited, but the profession items in them get throttled after you get a few
[5:55:20] Qelvue: @Towelliee if it's clipped into terrain you can use interact button to still get it. I think they might reset bi-weekly, sometimes I suddenly have them all over the place, while prolonged grinding of em I find less over time.

[5:55:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think also the frequency that they show up on your map gets throttled after you find a bunch
[5:55:55] Qelvue: @Towelliee they were unlimited because of bug.

[5:58:30] slaughteredpig: towCopium
[5:58:57] Reckless_Monk: Metzen is Warcraft though
[5:58:57] EASanDiego: @Reckless_Monk we can only dream
[5:59:25] Reckless_Monk: literally built the world on a freaking chalk board
[5:59:28] MMokuin: People forgot that Metzne knew about everything that happened in the blizzard...
[5:59:32] Molvonos: We got an expansion involving the elements, of course Metzen's gonna be voice acting a bitchy Thrall whining about shit while his woman stands there with a blank look on her face.
[5:59:35] Owc2ar: !drops
[5:59:51] Reckless_Monk: Its like saying Brad McQuad wasnt EverQuest
[6:00:31] Jodicus: Who knows if they dont keep the new people from being creative with the franchise now.
[6:00:33] Molvonos: Brands and games evolve past their creators.  Metzen might have been Warcraft, but he isn't the only reason behind it.
[6:00:36] Iabooseyou: @Towelliee what was the addon that shows all quests on the map
[6:00:45] ty_ston96: this expansion is honestly the most fun ive had with the game in awhile
[6:00:57] rosina_scarlett: what do you think of the SST recolor mounts and the warden transmog?
[6:01:16] zodd_amhai: im having the same hype i had when legion launched but more fun cuz of dragonriding and crafting
[6:01:18] naznarens: reality is we dont actually care one bit for the employees and their plight, we just care for the games to come out good, we are not required to emotionally connect with them and that is reality
[6:01:27] EASanDiego: maybe metzen can explain whats going on with the sword in silithus
[6:01:37] Molvonos: What sword
[6:01:51] Reckless_Monk: @jeangulfran pretty much how i think... but twitter is so toxic
[6:02:10] EASanDiego: LUL
[6:02:12] mistr_pockets: LOL
[6:02:32] EASanDiego: they took his doomhammer away and now they give him the sword
[6:02:32] Qelvue: @Towelliee what of the allthethings collectors? Every recipe and craft from the new professions xD
[6:02:50] mistr_pockets: ‚ÄúHey bro, so we left this sword as kind of a loose end‚Ä¶.Can you take care of this?‚Äù
[6:03:25] Reckless_Monk: Steve will probably out by next expansion. with Metzen around
