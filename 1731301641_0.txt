[4:36:39] Capull0Spawn: how much mastery you got? 16% mastery you got 5 meter range.
[4:37:09] justmikety: MM use kill command?
[4:37:32] Capull0Spawn: no marksman doesnt use kill command
[4:37:36] Capull0Spawn: thats bs xD
[4:38:18] Capull0Spawn: you can go for Lone Wolf in low elo, and to the top you have to use a pet, but kill command is a no go
[4:38:32] Capull0Spawn: go for steel trap
[4:39:20] Cowardpatty: You will never use it
[4:39:22] Capull0Spawn: steel trap
[4:39:24] Capull0Spawn: for peel

[4:40:28] Cowardpatty: Personally, I don't go down the serpent sting branch
[4:40:30] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:40:31] Capull0Spawn: better
[4:41:00] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:41:52] Cowardpatty: No, you Aimed Shot first becuase Rapid Fire builds focus
[4:42:15] Capull0Spawn: multishot is wasted
[4:42:27] Capull0Spawn: you skill to surging shot
[4:42:54] Cowardpatty: I wouldn't take the Serpent Sting branch.  You get free sting on Aimed Shot if you talent it
[4:43:08] Kafflol: You're a legend brother, your perseverance is admirable. You're the person who opened the door for everyone streaming WoW and I reckon the game wouldn't be where it is today without your influence. I don't really twitch, just came on and saw you streaming so wanted to say God Bless my bro Swifty.
[4:43:15] Capull0Spawn: explosiv shot is not that strong. you give up peel for explosiv. serpent sting is useless
[4:43:38] Cowardpatty: Your Aimed Shot will apply Serpent Sting if you take that talent
[4:43:46] jamboss95: u have a talent on mm right side
[4:43:47] Capull0Spawn: your main dmg is aimshot rapid fire and arcane shot
[4:43:54] jamboss95: where aimed shot automatically appliues seprent sting
[4:44:05] Capull0Spawn: no
[4:44:06] jamboss95: so no point in taking serpent sting talent
[4:44:08] Capull0Spawn: keep chakram
[4:44:11] jamboss95: only if u want to play latent poison
[4:44:15] Capull0Spawn: take one of the eye
[4:44:17] Cowardpatty: Take Chakram over Explosive
[4:44:26] jamboss95: right side
[4:44:30] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:44:40] jamboss95: if u play explosive dont pick steel trap
[4:44:43] jamboss95: u may breake it
[4:44:44] Capull0Spawn: take one of from master marksman
[4:44:46] jamboss95: with explosive
[4:44:55] Capull0Spawn: than you can take explosiv
[4:45:00] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:45:19] jamboss95: take deadeye
[4:45:26] Capull0Spawn: take one point of master marksman and put that into explosiv shot
[4:45:28] jamboss95: and the talent under deadeye applies serpent sting
[4:45:30] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:45:30] jamboss95: on aimed shot
[4:45:57] Cowardpatty: I'd take Volley and Deathblow for sure, but that's just me
[4:46:12] Humicrobe: get rid of movement speed and add the 10% less dmg talent
[4:46:18] Humicrobe: then take explosive
[4:46:39] jamboss95: deathnblow
[4:46:42] jamboss95: for sure
[4:46:53] jamboss95: volley and also razor fragments
[4:47:16] Humicrobe: is this pvp MM or pve?
[4:47:19] Cowardpatty: You don't channel it either. It's fire and forget
[4:47:40] kallekapisten: where can i find what entchants i need on my gear for pvp hunter ?
[4:47:58] jamboss95: not really
[4:48:01] jamboss95: u use volley
[4:48:02] Capull0Spawn: take one point of master marksman and put that into explosiv
[4:48:03] Cowardpatty: Not sure you will want all the AoE talents for PvP.
[4:48:05] jamboss95: and get explosive from volley
[4:48:17] jamboss95: get salvo
[4:48:19] jamboss95: dont get multishot
[4:48:34] Humicrobe: you can also get rid of 6% movement speed and get CC dmg reduct + explosive
[4:48:37] Capull0Spawn: take one point of master marksman and put that into explosiv thats better
[4:48:41] jamboss95: yes

[4:49:34] Capull0Spawn: take one point of master marksman and put that into explosiv
[4:49:43] jamboss95: or if u want multishot is good for pve
[4:49:45] Capull0Spawn: you need too
[4:49:45] Clutchin420: u  dont need multi shot
[4:49:48] Humicrobe: multi is useless in pvp mm
[4:49:48] rokath1803: yes get trushot
[4:49:59] Cowardpatty: Honestly I'd keep L&L because it's fun
[4:50:00] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
