[0:11:24] devilhawk83: The Lions-49ers game was nuts as that game could of went either way
[0:12:42] letts07: 4 druids wildigS
[0:12:44] bloomiqt: Can't even tell what convo is about. I live under a rock when it comes to sports ☠️
[0:12:48] Guffels: watching the lions defense throw that game was sad
[0:13:38] devilhawk83: I am only happy the 49ers won as it is going to be a good game to see the 49ers-Chiefs Super Bowl game konazbHype
[0:14:19] devilhawk83: Best hire Chiefs did was getting Andy Reid

[0:15:52] Ok_Kingston: they left 6 points on the field with their stupid 4th downs

[0:18:11] WytherOK: the pregrame for the chiefs game was hilarious given the outcome, it was basically "The ravens have the best of *every position" and then you had the chiefs "We're all surprised they're here"
[0:18:20] Thrall966: yo JB why u playing europe ? is the game playable at 105 ping
[0:18:28] dragona92: !eu
[0:18:28] StreamElements: JB re-rolled on EU servers Nov 2020 so he can be a daytime streamer and spend more time with the kids and !bb. Server: Tarren Mill-Horde. Guild: <Infinite> Ping: ~115ms. jdotbComfy
[0:18:59] devilhawk83: yep. Dan Campbell wanted to win the game and I can’t blame him for being aggressive on 4th down especially during the season, they were 20-25 so if you got the confidence in thinking that you can get the conversion then go for it
[0:19:50] dragona92: RIP monk buff
[0:19:53] s_dawg1: You swapping to mistweaver?
[0:20:02] Guffels: losing MW on fyrakk especially

[0:30:31] Waradin24: i have a 483 belor relos and i cleared heroic yesterday, one with leech dropped and i was able to need it
[0:30:36] Guffels: @StreamElements or tier tokens shouldn't randomly spawn terts

[0:31:19] Nico_vdM: Hi @jdotb
[0:33:05] gamor12: @jdotb  Just like the soak from vault, you should also be able to buy leech or whatever you want to put on your gear
[0:33:44] itsmagyks: link the monitors
[0:33:47] devilhawk83: I know LG is using W-OLED
[0:33:59] zebracak35: the main differnce betwen qd oled an woled is text on qdoled is fucking GARBAGE
[0:34:00] AllButGood: This generation of OLED was catastrophic, the temporal dithering was insane and they looked like garbage any time you viewed something dark:ish. I really hope the CES stuff is better
[0:34:07] xjudawg: What headphones are you using? Im looking for new in-ears.
[0:34:17] ren0m: Would you give me a crash course on how to heal with H Pala? I have an alt and haven't touched it since S1.
[0:34:18] WytherOK: i would definitely go with the cutie oled
[0:34:25] jdotb: !earbuds
[0:34:28] zebracak35: i promise you it wil bug you at the start
[0:34:34] xjudawg: And can you recommend them?
[0:34:35] devilhawk83: supposedly W-OLED got less burn-in
[0:34:42] Guffels: @ren0m reroll to MW
[0:34:47] Guffels: KEKW
[0:34:51] xjudawg: @Guffels lol
[0:35:07] WytherOK: I wonder if they will drop spenders for h pal next xpac
[0:36:08] ren0m: The 12 stacks?
[0:36:08] kondelol: uuh
[0:36:40] ren0m: So it's basically holy shocking

[0:36:48] camshreds: what's good
[0:37:05] zebracak35: I bought the PG27AQDM and i love it, oled is real nice
[0:37:23] devilhawk83: Yep
[0:37:38] devilhawk83: Their spenders needs a rework
[0:38:32] Pinslate: im not really sure how higher rating hpals are making it
[0:38:53] Pinslate: healing on hpal vs rdruid is way harder for me to keep people up
[0:38:57] ren0m: So shock and flash of light are the main spells. Spenders are just there to use up holy power?
[0:39:03] WytherOK: just get rid of infusion and treat h power as a flash/holy light buff
[0:39:26] ren0m: Doesn't sound too fun. Maybe I should play another healer as an alt
[0:39:26] devilhawk83: I am hoping Blizzard gives Prot Paladins a talent that allows our Consecration to move with us in War Wihin like we had in WoD
[0:39:54] WytherOK: devilhawk83 what you don't like being glued to a spot for some amount of seconds? :)
[0:39:56] Guffels: who doesnt lowe proc roulette ya know
[0:40:03] Guffels: love*
[0:40:12] Espincry: PartyHat

[0:41:51] ren0m: Ah
[0:42:04] devilhawk83: @wytherok it when you got to move out of consecration that you loses the Damage Reduction you gets from staying in your Consecration as Prot Paladins can be very squishy when they are not staying in their Consecration
[0:42:19] ren0m: I'll test it out today and see how it goes
[0:42:30] ren0m: It's a completely different style than healing with rDruid
[0:42:37] ren0m: Granted all healers are different
[0:42:46] gulcracko: is that raid only? or m+ too
[0:44:03] ren0m: Or we can just go back to WotLK days when you spam flash of light :D
[0:44:27] RemwayTV: send the fun
[0:44:40] s_dawg1: Have you done your alt keys yet?
[0:44:58] ren0m: They pay that much for 27?
[0:45:18] devilhawk83: chrysLUL Sounds like back in BC when you runs as much Crit as you can so that when you Crit with FoL or HL, you gets 100% of the mana back @ren0m
[0:45:20] FauniB: man I boosted 28 DHT for 300k as well, how is the pay the same BibleThump
[0:45:20] bloomiqt: ye its 300k per booster
[0:45:25] DustsoulTV: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[0:45:33] bloomiqt: u still get paid even deplete if it's just boostee issue

[0:49:10] Tamis2Hamis: PartyHat
[0:49:35] xDeceit: honestly having no instance map would be better than what you get in rise
[0:50:14] xDeceit: if you cant see your teammates a map is so much less helpful when youre trying to figure out where to go
[0:50:32] Solarion_: the platform you are looking for is actually does not exist
[0:50:33] xDeceit: thats the sand room
[0:50:36] Solarion_: LUL
[0:50:38] xSlimBeatzZ: No, its where 2. Boss is.
[0:50:39] xDeceit: with the chronicar in it
[0:50:42] s_dawg1: Its 2nd boss of fall room
[0:50:51] xDeceit: thats why the map is bad because it overlaps lmao
[0:50:56] xSlimBeatzZ: Yea this room
[0:51:41] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[0:52:08] Sizebot: DOTI in general might be the biggest black mark on Dragonflight. Even more so than the 10.1.5 balance disaster
[0:52:19] Camelbak21: Sometimes you can't even see people on the map if you're on a different "layer" there
[0:53:10] Hellgrinnnn: form vs function, good old debate
[0:53:11] happierfeet_: so pwetty who cares about informative, maps shouldnt be informative
[0:53:22] Tharayel: PartyHat All the best!
[0:53:29] xSlimBeatzZ: Fall, timeable without even playing right, Rise... one death, close to untimable
[0:53:39] iActium: Still salty we went from Tazavesh to Dawn
[0:54:02] s_dawg1: I liked the BFA mega dungeon
[0:54:03] xSlimBeatzZ: Tazavesh was nice, loved streets <3
[0:54:09] Tamis2Hamis: taza was so buggy when it launched
[0:54:10] shinichit: I liked half of mechagon. The inside one
[0:54:18] Hellgrinnnn: mechagon !
[0:54:21] Camelbak21: Bro the mega dungeons fucking suck. Make 2 different unique dungeons instead if you have to
[0:54:38] Camelbak21: this obsession with a mega dungeon cause BRD existed 20 years ago is just stupid
[0:54:40] xSlimBeatzZ: Bot where trash -.-
[0:54:56] xSlimBeatzZ: That dungeon was so useless for m+
[0:55:01] shinichit: Yeah agreed, the junkyard was horrible
[0:55:08] devilhawk83: Workshop in Mechagon was pretty fun. Junkyard last boss was really good but the rest was just meh
[0:55:36] xDeceit: although i dont miss the kyrian weapons, i really miss necrotic wake
[0:55:50] JustTipu: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!

[0:56:42] gripps22: it's so clear that the mega dungeons are built with the intent of Mythic 0 and keystone scaling is a complete afterthought
[0:56:44] drumminbacon: the megadungeons are so much fun. i have loved all of them.
[0:56:56] devilhawk83: konazbRes
[0:57:06] dannyridsdale01: the idea of making a patch a 2-part dungeon then making another patch content just splitting it is so ruthlessly corner-cutting lmao
[0:57:10] happierfeet_: @drumminbacon fleikeS
[0:57:17] devilhawk83: Megadungeons are not that fun
[0:57:26] treavorthenusance: fall is okay because it has so little trash. nix the rp and its a great key
[0:57:40] Piaggio: saw jb thinking about a non offensive way to reply to that KEKW
[0:57:56] gripps22: intern dungeon fr lmao
[0:58:44] WytherOK: I've hated the throwback dungeon M+ experience
[0:58:47] Sizebot: Or just invest that time into making the existing dungeon pool not dogshit for once
[0:58:50] dannyridsdale01: galakrond looked like one person made it as an application to blizz to me lol
[0:58:56] happierfeet_: like 2-3 new dungeons or 7-8 reused dungeons yeah probably
[0:58:59] WytherOK: fucking uldaman, fuck sbg, fuck throne
[0:59:01] xSlimBeatzZ: Just take the fucking ring they made an island for, to make it useless after 1 or 2 Month WTF???????????
[0:59:08] devilhawk83: I’m had a feeling DotI was planned to be a raid but because of time restraints, had to convert it to a megadungeon
[1:00:05] Wiseved: Sup jb
[1:00:36] itsmagyks: If you had a gun to your head and were forced to swap to another healer for the rest of the season, what would you pick?

[1:01:13] gripps22: because it's lame? mounts having unique methods of acquisition is cool, even if AOTC is easy
[1:01:15] devilhawk83: The AotC SoO mount?
[1:01:39] treavorthenusance: mount farmers malding
[1:01:44] Camelbak21: I mean it kinda is a slippery slope, no? What more will they add to the tendie shop that once was a neat thing to get
[1:01:47] pumpkinbeats: Kappa
[1:01:48] gripps22: For me, it's not a pride thing. If they put the bronze drake on the trading post I'd also have beef. Just let these mounts stay what they are
[1:01:52] pumpkinbeats: Jebaited
[1:01:59] sw0ngs: it was back in MOP, like 10 years ago lol
[1:02:00] devilhawk83: yep @gripps22
[1:02:03] kelly_mac06: kelly_mac06 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months, currently on a 67 month streak! 
[1:02:10] zebajin: who cares about a 10 year old mount that came from curve
[1:02:22] Camelbak21: I mean make something new?
[1:02:58] sw0ngs: just link ppl your actually achievement lol, no need to whip your mount out haha
[1:03:32] Camelbak21: People play rpgs for many different reasons, that might be one reason for some. I mean shit, I don't care too much, but I also don't get this "blizz" can do no wrong cause it's just a game thing
[1:03:36] kelly_mac06: man idc at all about the mounts,  i dont really even use them
[1:03:45] gripps22: @perkkuheppu would be lame af. It's cool to see natty black AQ mounts.
[1:04:04] sw0ngs: I'm happy that they are giving out old mounts that I missed out on
[1:04:30] gripps22: As someone that didn't play during legion, I hope they don't bring back the OG mage tower stuff
[1:05:40] prugar: I just find the conversation about exclusivity for an AotC which have turned into Friendship mount fo the end of expansion because people will spam carries is just dumb
[1:06:02] Plackoz: we might soon get gladiator mount too :)
[1:06:16] Nico_vdM: My opinion on it is this:  If you haven't used the mount once since you got it - does it really matter that people can buy it now?
[1:06:29] Nico_vdM: If it was really important one would use it

[1:06:42] WytherOK: I played a game years ago called Dead by Daylight, it had a rare skin community that would spend hundreds on skins. then the company decided to give everyone all skins
[1:06:44] WytherOK: it was hilarious
[1:06:53] fakegucci_hmu: if you dont find accomplishment, whats the purpose of achieving anything?
[1:07:06] pumpkinbeats: because it does matter
[1:07:07] ScapeeJ: Gromnak is important to me in life
[1:07:18] zebracak35: @fakegucci_hmu what? You still have the accoplishment
[1:07:39] bundt_hole: right you still have the achievement if its that important to you
[1:07:57] treavorthenusance: the sanctification of beating a challenge is the reward
[1:08:02] bloomiqt: Why the fuck would I care if someone else gets same mount as I did 4 years ago? I still have the achievement while the other person only has the mount.
[1:08:02] PixelPerphect: they could just appease those people by simply adding a (Legacy) tag to the achievement or mount
[1:08:12] pumpkinbeats: dont you wanna flex
[1:08:15] Kaitaa86: what mount are we talking about? just popped in.
[1:08:17] gripps22: unique methods of acquisition are cool and tell you something about that player. "Oh cool that guy did AOTC/CE/Glad or whatever in BFA." Adding stuff to TP makes mounts less cool
[1:08:34] gripps22: even if it is easy sauce aotc or whatever
[1:08:42] sandman1244: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[1:09:01] gripps22: Ok you know what? based take. move AOTC/CE/glad stuff to titles. I like that
[1:09:08] Camelbak21: And?
[1:09:13] PixelPerphect: they did that with every mount when they made dragonriding LOL
[1:09:15] smokeweedz: yo JB how is it going
[1:09:20] smokeweedz: SourPls
[1:09:28] the_pyke: but can you declare that you are the greatest ever without that medals: :D :D
[1:09:35] pumpkinbeats: why does it?
[1:10:07] Nico_vdM: People seem to forget that AOTC can be bought too
[1:10:11] bundt_hole: plus more people are gonna be happy to finally get to use the mount than there are people upset at it
[1:11:02] leubinator: damn asmon having a bad take never heard of that before
[1:11:13] gripps22: lmfao
[1:11:19] gripps22: you spent it on WHAT
[1:12:02] pumpkinbeats: some wild takes going on here
[1:12:11] MicHawkh: PartyHat Grattis på partnerårsdagen!
[1:12:42] leubinator: i love the wowtoken i buy one every couple months so i don't have to waste my lifetime farming gold
[1:12:44] pumpkinbeats: nah theyre like damn thats a nice car
[1:12:54] Myyws: that's just jealousy
[1:13:10] MicHawkh: No thats wrong imo. people are mostly jelaous and hating on people that have somthing that they dont have themselves
[1:14:24] pumpkinbeats: is it just a video game or a life
[1:14:34] Piaggio: its true, my self worth is tied to the details meter :)
[1:14:58] pumpkinbeats: for some including yourself its a job?
[1:15:06] dannyridsdale01: I throw around the word untalented in my head a lot when I think of them but its not about that its their choice to be wow elite
[1:16:27] pumpkinbeats: ppl that value the rewards shouldnt have to sacrifice that because blizzard needs to allocate funds elsewhere
[1:16:34] treavorthenusance: ive done alot of stuff in wow and it's gotten me laid 0 times. so giving some dude a getting a mount bothers me 0
[1:16:39] pumpkinbeats: they should spend more !

[1:16:52] Guffels: i still dont think that IO is good motivation but Im also not a parse lord so idk. number go up isnt enough for me to care but mounts and titles are
[1:17:52] pumpkinbeats: because its still rare
[1:17:57] pumpkinbeats: and difficult to obtain
[1:18:10] demeco31: people were pissed when t3 came to the BMAH and that was dumb too
[1:18:12] pumpkinbeats: no to get the mounts
[1:18:18] pumpkinbeats: takes many tries
[1:18:22] gripps22: I have a hard time doing SoO and not falling asleep
[1:18:27] Myyws: efforts doesnt mean difficulty
[1:18:40] treavorthenusance: but your 1 shotting bosses and just spending time to get mounts. its not really an achivement
[1:19:05] Guffels: im complaning I cant go one shot shadowlands bosses already
[1:19:19] the_pyke: gear is like a tshirt and a mount like a car
[1:19:20] treavorthenusance: like getting invincible is cool but not a notable achivement at this point in time
[1:19:33] host_255: hard agree
[1:19:41] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:19:42] leubinator: transmog farming is the pinnacle content for ppl that are mad at the mount going to the trading post
[1:20:20] pumpkinbeats: i like mount farming, i also dont mind if it appears in trading post later
[1:20:30] Myyws: why would ppl still even care about others getting X or Y mount/mog
[1:21:12] pumpkinbeats: whats that tiger that ppl will pay 4000 dollars for
[1:21:20] pumpkinbeats: should that appear in the post XD
[1:21:23] host_255: the reason why the community are upset. is that they want to feel exclusive within the MMO community and a “haha I have this and you can’t get it”. issues, this was inherently how an mmo was in regards to exclusivity.
[1:21:36] leubinator: zul gurub tiger? @pumpkinbeats

[1:21:56] pumpkinbeats: celestial ? i think
[1:22:00] pumpkinbeats: i have to look
[1:22:10] Piaggio: wait till they reopen the mage tower mogs then it'll be funny
[1:22:20] Kaitaa86: So then can we get the druid mage tower forms? the glowy cats. Because I want that.
[1:22:27] smokeweedz: SourPls
[1:22:45] host_255: example, as we all know. as soon as swift tiger is available. every single owner of it already will be upset. because they had it, and enjoy ‘knowing’ nobody else can get it. the moment ppl can. owners are upset.
[1:22:50] host_255: it’s a mindset and arrogance thing
[1:23:06] walkinginyourshoes: i have the mage tower forms and still think they should return that
[1:23:08] devilhawk83: same here chrysLUL
[1:23:13] zangari_: wow sucks
[1:23:17] ren0m: It's bad business to have things locked because new players missed it imo.
[1:23:35] devilhawk83: chrysLUL
[1:23:43] smokeweedz: @soul2250 thats not true, the value of a certain mounts/tmog is increased by its rarity. If everyone suddenly has it, it stops being good
[1:23:54] ren0m: Didn't mage tower return a few months back?
[1:24:08] ren0m: Or is it gone now
[1:24:13] walkinginyourshoes: @ren0m we're talking legion stuff
[1:24:33] ren0m: I got the green bear form
[1:24:36] ren0m: I though it's the same thing
[1:24:50] devilhawk83: It returned but it is a bit more difficult compared to when it first released @ren0m
[1:24:50] ren0m: Ah
[1:24:58] kelly_mac06: yea the other stuff from MT now is just mog
[1:25:01] kelly_mac06: and a mount
[1:25:02] NivSv: que is dead
[1:25:08] kelly_mac06: back then it was weapon appearances
[1:25:13] Kaitaa86: there were cat forms that we can't get now
[1:25:14] ren0m: @devilhawk83 Ye I spent 3h doing the thing.
[1:25:39] kelly_mac06: yea but felbear is new
[1:25:40] host_255: I’d love the mage MoP challenge mode
[1:25:41] drumminbacon: i love my book mount. wish there was more than a feat of strength for all specs or i might go for it. mage tower is fun
[1:25:41] WingedChipmunk: yes wearbear was a mage tower appearance
[1:25:57] ren0m: Do you have the legion appearance?

[1:32:34] SCMSV: Texas has like four seasons per week all in the same city though LUL
[1:33:13] SCMSV: I'm used to it but the summers don't feel that bad
[1:33:15] WytherOK: come on down to texas, we had more than 100 days last year that were over 100 degrees
[1:33:16] demeco31: move to phoenix lol
[1:33:43] SCMSV: It's very humid near the Gulf

[1:34:26] treavorthenusance: the pug threshold

[3:05:26] SparrowONE: Think you can do "death" too
[3:05:41] ottomr1990: @Lara_TV_ a good amount of it is holystrike too so holy + phys.  but still i don't think you'd bring monk for mystic touch if the ret is the only thing getting some value from it
[3:05:59] JackBurton176: i thought target was an option but confused if @mouseover counts too. !
[3:06:12] dragona92: Ret's kinda like enh shammy - most of it's dam is magical bar melee
[3:06:18] Nico_vdM: Its target, timer, combat and modifiers
[3:06:24] Lara_TV_: @ottomr1990 The question then is can holystrike dmg double dip from both chaos brand and mystic touch?

[6:58:27] Guffels: closest 4 plus target with a preference for anyone in range who doesnt have attonement already
[7:03:14] CarbonWard1: if it makes you feel better, people will continue to die to frontals in P1 even after 400 pulls
[7:04:05] Guffels: just looking at this boss, my first question would be if there is enough dps to 5 heal
[7:04:10] flawlesslykun: @CarbonWard1 dude i was watching jmy re-clear with method just now, and last phase wipes... ye that's the real tilter
[7:04:29] flawlesslykun: u can literaly bring the boss to 1%, boom seed person dies, it's a wipe

[7:12:17] CarbonWard1: they gain extra 10% leech when below 50% health
[7:13:43] CarbonWard1: That R starting Aug is def not using any defensives lol
[7:14:35] CarbonWard1: he got cleaved for 80% of his HP, meaning he didn't scale, and he wasn't regening any health during rend, meaning he didn't use renewing blaze
