[2:05:26] AgentIce99: 210 silver coins to get to exalted so not that bad
[2:05:45] Golumzz: Can i ask. Me and a friend of mine are haveing a disagreement over loot in classic wow now SoD. He belives gear type goes over stats I.E priest, mage, lock and got dibbs on cloth gear Like shaman ele/resto cant need it and druid resto etc. I disagree if you are a healer or caster because of how stats are allocated in classic. Am i in the wrong for meaning and thinking that?
[2:05:57] flugrman: that’s like 45ish events
[2:06:01] flugrman: to get exalted
[2:06:08] flugrman: if you get Atleast 500 copper
[2:06:30] AgentIce99: got 22s and 18s my last two events as war so it goes faster than that
[2:06:38] Golumzz: Thx for clarifying :)
[2:06:56] Kiewicz92: shaved pshero :)
[2:06:57] beyondwarr: are you making profit from dynamites?
[2:06:58] R1ch3n: it's just 2.2 stv gold for exalted with ab from 0
[2:07:02] oilyblackmouth: in 2004 people believed in armor type prio, but that was 20 years ago

[2:09:23] weahhc: You sing very well
[2:09:23] Golumzz: @ty_ston96 Because he played a druid in classic wow and i played a warrior. I needed on leather ( was really good for warr he lost) Now in sod he plays Clothy and i play ele shaman who got some good cloth pieces (sod) He thinks im egotistical for meaning that i as an ele shaman can need on cloth becasue the leather/mail stats are somewhat bad early before raid
[2:09:25] LavaVaYn3: Thats a Tank Warlock item now. And is actually relevant KEKW
[2:09:45] Xadriell: I dunno, what do you have in mind
[2:10:03] Goulakis: so isn’t a good idea to replace the backstab and sinister strike talents with something else from assassination probably?

[2:11:48] Golumzz: It is kind of an open ended question. Because the situation has not occured yet, All i have said is that caster/healer have just as much prio on good cloth gear as the mage, lock and priest which i disagree with
[2:11:49] bassiemon123: Next phase kara crypts, 100% would bet my left nut for it

[6:35:57] copper_cloud: @LavaVaYn3 still waiting for the article
[6:36:01] bartoktv: the only reason why alcohool is legal its cuz you can actually die if you stop drinkin , if you are an alcoholic ofc
