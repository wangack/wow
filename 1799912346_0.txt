[1:21:13] McpoT: BS has sharpening stones right? those are pretty decent
[1:21:20] lazer_1794: dont you get a heal with herbalism?
[1:21:21] Plaveris: gerb/alch or engi, engi is very good for utility
[1:21:27] Plaveris: herb*
[1:21:49] akkatest: crafting better gear for urself while lvling is a myth
[1:22:01] aguntus: Mining/Engin
[1:22:08] CptSpock: cant see the talent tree
[1:22:12] killvaine05: engineering is the best to go
[1:22:35] VanishmentThisWorld: you can make some nice armor and weapons for you
[1:22:53] killvaine05: all the gear from BS is really bad by the time you can get all the mats to make something
[1:23:22] CptSpock: true
[1:23:25] Seehk: !warrior
[1:23:25] StreamElements: Swifty's human warrior is still alive. He's just leveling a Rogue to level 10 to see if there is HC PvP.
[1:23:27] sereneswag: true bs is bad in vanilla
[1:23:41] TheEndIsNear777: they need to rework professions in vanilla pl0x!

[1:23:55] Plaveris: thats why i think engineering would be better
[1:24:01] Cowardpatty: Honestly, I thought doing Herb/Alch on your last warrior for potions (heals/buffs) was the way to go for hardcore
[1:24:22] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:24:31] CptSpock: if you dont want to die then yes prot
[1:24:38] Locrinus: On a hardcore yes, no good. BUT, on a regular server, I use my bs to make a whole arsenal of weaponry for my alts. It’s so nice to have weapon left and upgrades waiting for me.
[1:24:45] dcfreek5252: What server are people playing on for HC
[1:25:06] killvaine05: @Cowardpatty yeah herb/alch is the way to go but its such a pain to get herbs with how over populated the first 2 leveling zones are
[1:25:08] Plaveris: @dcfreek5252 blopdsail bucaneers
[1:25:16] Plaveris: bloodsail*

[5:01:57] frosty78: I havent really read the rules very much but at 60 are you scott free or rules still in effect, and as well, since you cant group a run more than once, are you allowed to solo them?
[5:01:57] Cyenna: Do aoe dmg
[5:02:26] taminooooooooooo: is priest a good class for HC?
[5:02:30] Metalkat: feels weird resubbing after so many years because of this lol
[5:02:36] Metalkat: I blame you
[5:02:38] Chosey: @frosty78 you can choose to keep playing by the rules or just play normally at 60
[5:02:47] hollywood__cole: Yeah priest is really good for HC; but it is slow

[5:25:25] kaiff_: Thanks for the info man  !
[5:25:32] frosty78: WoW doesnt want things like DBM, bc it makes the game too easy, but they cant stop addons without removing the combat log. Imagine trying to do a raid boss fight without being told where to go and when by DBM. lol
[5:26:01] zugzuggies: its a simon says for raiding
[5:26:03] Airwaive: bro dont get ganked by benny blanco
[5:26:13] coconust1: Everyone will wipe even in classic without DBM
[5:26:15] UncleAboosh: What is that add-on called?
[5:26:19] Unosojudio: go raid mythic or do a key w/o DBM
[5:26:21] Grael1256: its completly playable without DBM.... o . O
[5:26:21] Unosojudio: have fun
[5:26:22] Locrinus: It’s a standard because they are there. No addons, and ppl just get skarter
[5:26:24] edlectric: where did you find the elite dragon thing on leatrix plus
[5:26:26] Voodoodippin: WeakAuras ruined the game change my mind
[5:26:35] Locrinus: Smarter*
[5:26:35] zugzuggies: imagine if DBM wasnt allowed.
[5:26:36] BoricuaSJ: Space News: Volume up! https://www.facebook.com/reel/275836568105011
[5:26:36] Unosojudio: they changed that rule years ago @Swifty
[5:26:45] froth3n: addons and wow logs ruined the game
[5:26:47] One_or_2: blizz hates DBM and that
[5:26:53] sneakykill420: thats pvp tho for pve world first stuff thats done from home with addons
[5:26:54] jennindf: yeah they can use them now i think
[5:27:06] zugzuggies: Things that make the game easier make it less fun
[5:27:10] icefloe_: NN EU
[5:27:15] Zalazane: addons make you brain dead and not think for yourself about the game
[5:27:16] BloodSick_PT: the addons only read features that are already there. they only make it easier to read
[5:27:20] Locrinus: The game didn’t start casual friendly. Along time ago you use to actually lose xp for dying
[5:27:45] zugzuggies: exactly my point. you shouldnt have them
[5:27:53] BoricuaSJ: try this one https://www.facebook.com/reel/275836568105011/?s=fb_shorts_tab&stack_idx=0
[5:28:05] Blaster: i freakin love bori and his links and his whole existence
[5:28:14] frosty78: That is why gnome sequencer isnt banned yet. Bc it doesnt simmulate perfect rotation, you can literally do the same thing with plain macros that are part of the game
[5:28:17] BoricuaSJ: :)
[5:28:21] Voodoodippin: RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL
[5:28:22] Kingdom1623: i still use the default interface and i love it.

[5:29:16] zjuqtv: @Foortsatak already made a toon :)
[5:29:18] zugzuggies: Thats a sad situation and im not saying they shouldnt be able to play the game. i just think addons that make the game too easy for the rest of us dumb it down and make it boring.

[5:30:53] Voodoodippin: sepulcher of the first ones was created around defeating WeakAuras
[5:31:15] P3ntaskill: Tbh raiding with out dbm is very doable with a raid leader that studied a fight and you go in with a game plan and good comms
[5:31:40] zugzuggies: Healers must die is another addon thats cheating
[5:32:28] neverbornlucky: my stupid cheap wireless mouse I bought from amazon scrolling wheel broek

[5:33:21] Voodoodippin: Preach has a great video on what addons are allowed to use and what they cant use.
[5:33:32] tofuwizard: You could just rock the stream like this
[5:33:39] frosty78: Final Fantasy doesnt allow addons for this reason here. The game is meant to be the designed way.
