[2:18:12] Claylol: Yeah but it's mostly APES who got beta invite because they were the AB/WSG tournament winners
[2:18:25] Rudric_Ice: Streamers and youtubers u mean LUL
[2:18:38] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee 638k out of 1 mil for the second pet
[2:18:39] Claylol: 90% of apes didn't get invited, just the guys who competed and won in the tournanents
[2:19:00] bodli1125: the thing is us is like a test for blizz lower overall playercount and eu will get it later maybe
[2:19:00] nilachip: yeah no EU invitations
[2:19:05] Heekss: well obvs you want to give beta to the ppl that actually put in the efford to test
[2:19:14] Heekss: effort*
[2:19:17] Nilpointnil: they can probably learn more bugs just watching someone like that stream than the total reports LUL
[2:19:35] Claylol: I mean i agreed on the first wave of invites, no point in having a mass beta invite only to have it be griefed in the world and no testing done

[2:55:03] magemaster225: It was the dev silence that made the WoD drought unbearable, Shadowlands is just WoD with better PR

[3:07:42] Copsonson: Is it ElvUi that works?
[3:08:18] PageFault74: poor retail folks, apparently it's gonna take a while for your patch :(
[3:08:22] 00Nikh: winterspring is really good
[3:08:49] Zomgboy: :O
[3:08:54] magemaster225: september omegalul
[3:08:54] Akira_K_R: Winterspring has a a mount for the alliance i think, and ungoro crater a mount for the horde
[3:09:07] PageFault74: yup everyone is working from home, so...
[3:09:14] Zomgboy: i already barely play retail at this point.... some of my friends quit so
[3:09:21] Supers18: sept is suicide dude wtf
[3:09:32] Manticom: that will by to long not good
[3:09:37] Amalgamut: I think they're count on people falling in love with TBC over again
[3:09:56] magemaster225: gotta be may/june
[3:10:10] PageFault74: no idea, i just chill...sick back and chill
[3:10:10] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee but how many ppl that left retail are gonna go back and play BC?
[3:10:21] JonnasINF: Blizz management must be so happy they decided to do classic/tbc now
[3:10:23] Yagr6: who cares at this point.. i moved on to other games
[3:10:24] Pallananana: I mean... the one time boost service in tbc is basically blizz putting 1 foot in the door, so could be possible
[3:10:27] Coolkillah: i know i am
[3:10:34] Zomgboy: the lvl 58 boost really helps out
[3:10:42] BiggGooney: i quit retail about 3 months into shadowlands ill be back into BC
[3:10:43] Gorbungus: May 6th for next earnings.
[3:10:44] Amalgamut: Classic was carrying retail for the last bit before Shadowlands
[3:10:46] cashaga: im so bored now i have shadowlands sub and i refuse to play it
[3:10:46] polakias21: all tbc is the best expansion
[3:10:50] MetallicusGaming: I left retail and restarting classic just so I can play BC
[3:10:52] PageFault74: True that, BC was an amazing realease
[3:10:55] JonnasINF: I'm going to try tbc but I wasn't too fussed for classic
[3:11:03] JerBoody: I really hope they don’t release 9.1 and tbc close together
[3:11:03] Kyrrua: well vanilla is more hardcore while bc is more closer to retail
[3:11:06] Effin_Steffin: also vanilla was ass an BC was the best expansion ever
[3:11:11] PageFault74: Am I going back?  Nah, I like recent games Kappa
[3:11:19] Kyrrua: people just don't want the leveling and rpg aspect I guess
[3:11:29] Zomgboy: any news on phases in tbc yet or did i forget?
[3:11:39] snaksy: Zangarmash Kreygasm
[3:11:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: I always prefer BC leveling
[3:11:44] Kromede: and back, had a black out FeelsBadMan
[3:11:46] Manticom: nah happen Don't believe
[3:11:56] Layercake: Their plan was always to use BC to keep the subs going during 9.05 to 9.1 wait.
[3:12:10] WomboCombo94: stats on gear
[3:12:18] Zomgboy: loved zangarmarsh so much <3
[3:12:20] Pallananana: Outland... outland never changes FeelsBadMan
[3:12:24] demonbursts: from now quiting retail
[3:12:24] Harch: nesingwary quests require fewers mobs killed in retail
[3:12:26] Supers18: i mean what else will they be doing
[3:12:27] Harch: vs tbc classic
[3:12:31] Supers18: lol
[3:12:31] MetallicusGaming: yh the quests all stayed the same through all these years

[3:12:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: let's make tbc great again towPog towW
[3:13:00] Kyrrua: that's why dual spec will probably be there, it would simply make far more money for blizzard to keep retail players longer
[3:13:08] Manticom: that will be bad to slow not good
[3:13:30] Solid0Liquid: I think if blizz puts in cash grabs it's gonna turn off a lot of people, espescially after the big wig got a 200 mil bonus
[3:13:45] Zomgboy: going outside a bit brb
[3:14:13] Arakawa__: slippery slope
[3:14:16] Korupcija_: I got my hunter macro ready EZ
[3:14:17] PageFault74: people don't care, as long as they're getting their content
[3:14:21] Kyrrua: if bobby wants cash graps on tbc, he will. its useless wasting time arguing against
[3:14:27] Kyrrua: grabs*
[3:14:32] ImJstaMrTaco: who cares about the mount and boost tbh
[3:14:33] MetallicusGaming: I'd only care if I'd get a piece of that money LUL
[3:14:40] cashaga: @Towelliee QUIT? LUL  And play what?
[3:14:42] ImJstaMrTaco: boost might make my retail friends play tbc
[3:14:48] ImJstaMrTaco: mount looks cool
[3:14:49] Tegin7: blizz ceo got a 200mil bonus?!
[3:14:52] VIRUSplw: what cash grabs? lvl58 boost or theres more?

[3:15:33] PageFault74: yeah people freak out, no idea why
[3:15:39] Donwillis: facts
[3:15:40] Rujean: I am sure no one will use or is using windows OS because some CEO gets more money.
[3:15:41] Layercake: LUL People really think uncle Bobby knows wtf is BC
[3:15:57] Cliffhoof: LUL
[3:16:01] Akira_K_R: i dont understand how its a cash grab, the game is free with the WoW sub, its  not like they are making a Cash Store like Aion
[3:16:03] minho49: LUL
[3:16:05] Amalgamut: Fucky McWow Dude is what I'm sure Bobby Kotick refers to him as
[3:16:05] Grawh1: people are so stupid
[3:16:10] cashaga: no one can quit, there isnt even game 50 close to being as epic as wow problems and all, companies dont fully develop content anymore they sell it in DLC
[3:16:11] PageFault74: at least call of duty doesn't ask for monthly payments :)
[3:16:12] Layercake: Just give BC the COD special LUL

[3:16:36] LeagueQui: That is though when blizzard activision has a board of directors
[3:16:50] Mcfailadin: cant wait for tbc wow token
[3:16:51] Paleomino: store is one way to meet those targets
[3:16:53] Akira_K_R: When Wrath servers come out, that is making me curious how many players come back that have left, as Wrath was WoWs highest point i think
[3:16:53] JonnasINF: Everyone is an armchair dev these days
[3:16:55] Harch: race change without a name change would be alright
[3:16:55] Mcfailadin: EZ flying
[3:16:58] cashaga: You got a better chance of changing government policy than changing wow
[3:16:59] VIRUSplw: i just dont care it wont change anything for me @Towelliee
[3:17:09] legobind: oh if i can take my lvl 60 horde and make then alli i am all in like balls deep in
[3:17:10] FolkWardz: My man here is either streaming constant, or I'm just lucky with timing. Veri nice anyway Towee
[3:17:44] Manticom: wow is the best mmo that never change is the best mmo
[3:17:49] cashaga: 25% for your tier set
[3:17:54] cashaga: 25$
[3:17:58] Pallananana: A shop with gear not available in game, that's better than raid gear KEKW
[3:18:09] Tegin7: retail will eventually go that way, no?
[3:18:15] Mcfailadin: the vendor in thrallmar?
[3:18:37] TheUnknowing: I mean yeah, stuff like faction changes and name changes don't really impact the game at all. So I don't understand when people say  'well its a slippery slope.' well its 2021, not 2007. relax lol

[3:18:54] LeagueQui: its a symptom of why people quit
[3:18:54] legobind: ppl only hate the shop due to pets and mounts no one said shit when they had the helms in the shop back in wrath
[3:19:01] PageFault74: I quit Warcraft because I play to relax, not to challenge myself
[3:19:05] Mcfailadin: VULPERA KEKW
[3:19:06] Tegin7: I think most people quite because their friends quit...atleast thats my case
[3:19:07] PsychoWarren: lmfao
[3:19:11] VIRUSplw: why i would care because someone else is ridding some shop mount or other stuff
[3:19:18] Harch: i would quit if people changed to gome
[3:19:19] Harch: gnome
[3:19:22] MetallicusGaming: I Quit SL 4 weeks in coz I just didn't feel it
[3:19:25] Pallananana: I quit because... the magic just wasn't there anymore for me FeelsBadMan
[3:19:25] Cliffhoof: I quit because there is no Vulpera in Classic LUL
[3:19:47] Akira_K_R: the only thing that makes me take breaks from WoW is the overkill of questing, its brain numbing, but i dont quit fully

[3:20:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[3:20:34] slizard93: cardio
[3:20:40] Cliffhoof: @Tegin7 True brother
[3:21:54] JerBoody: It’s funny how many of the same people bitch about a possible tbc token and name changes are also in favor of alliance paladin getting seal of blood which is an actual functional change from the original
[3:21:57] zechetto: lol
[3:22:04] Playwisme: hammersquad should allow boosted only
[3:22:11] legobind: @Towelliee do you know if when in bc it lets you move to a pvp server from a pve server
[3:22:14] Playwisme: well, & belfs
[3:22:34] Cliffhoof: How will guilds be able to tell if you pay boost or not at level 70 LUL
[3:22:36] orthezuma: been away from the game for a while, is everyone getting a free boost with tbc?
[3:23:04] Talason: towelliee after dark
[3:23:26] Tegin7: so is BC a fresh start or do you continue your classic 60?
[3:23:34] PvtHudson093: LUL
[3:23:39] slizard93: !tbc
[3:23:39] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.

[3:23:41] PageFault74: Kappa
[3:23:42] Playwisme: @Towelliee I hope there are still spots open come pre patch, I only plan to play a pally so I cant join yet
[3:24:15] Playwisme: oh cool
[3:24:49] PJaai: u need neutral to turn in that quest

[3:26:09] VIRUSplw: damn paying for it KEKW
[3:26:10] PJaai: but u just need to pay if you want both. if you just want to stay on classic u dont need to pay
[3:26:28] Jay_rb: AngelThump
[3:26:32] Kyrrua: u still pay tho
[3:26:43] Playwisme: @CASHAGA when pre-patch launches, each character you log into will be given the option of xferring to classic forever or staying put for TBC. either one if free, but charge for both
[3:26:43] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[3:26:55] FolkWardz: Is the XP gained increased in TBC or WOtlk? (Quest, killing, all..) :D
[3:27:08] Tegin7: stay*

[3:27:34] Kyrrua: @Tegin7 some people say they have anxiety losing their progression
[3:27:37] sultan_of_sauce91: they could do ladders like diablo for classic servers
[3:27:46] VIRUSplw: to farm naxx for next years
[3:27:47] Felrane: alot of players not even in naxx in phase 6 still
[3:27:51] VIRUSplw: LUL
[3:28:11] Playwisme: I hope theres TBC forever servers in a few years, I dont really want to move on to wotlk
[3:28:19] Kyrrua: still need to farm tons of gold for naxx tho
[3:28:50] VIRUSplw: @Kyrrua losing what? u keep everything u work for so...
[3:28:52] Felrane: cost to raid naxx is just dumb
[3:28:52] coffeeatm: @Towelliee imagin The Hammer Squad meets up in Nagrands green plains lining up like a lotr film outside alliance camp and The Hammer Squad guild master shouts this is TBC Charge!
[3:29:00] Jay_rb: Unfriendly
[3:29:10] zechetto: THATS BAD
[3:29:12] legobind: bad
[3:29:12] Kyrrua: @VIRUSplw it loses value
[3:29:15] zechetto: you lose rep

[3:32:13] zechetto: You gotta understand casual to you is hardcore to us normies
[3:32:15] zechetto: lol
[3:32:24] Maego1: I loved wotlk pvp tho :D
[3:32:50] Tyrammus84: cata toughness at the start is what drove away alot of wrath players
[3:32:51] Jay_rb: They didn't know the game when it was more "difficult" KEKW
[3:32:54] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[3:32:59] Tornadogenesis: I personally preferred TBC, but Wrath was great.
[3:33:01] Kyrrua: #somechanges needs to get rid of casualization in wrath
[3:33:05] Merzerker: i thought firelands was way easier than any raid in wotlk
[3:33:10] CDubTheRIPper: viewer ulduar raids danP
[3:33:15] Maego1: Tribute to Immortality monkaS
[3:33:19] PageFault74: Yeah it is curious, how everything was difficult, then easy, then difficutl again
[3:33:26] realdevv: @Merzerker Someone didnt do pre-nerf Ragnaros Heroic
[3:33:44] Felrane: ya but your a druid so you can just hearth
[3:33:46] SpiketheDragonWolf: Yes north is moonglade
[3:33:48] Felrane: so head to winter
[3:34:04] Tornadogenesis: Maybe the difficult to non was more of them designing based off player engagement and subscription numbers and at the time.
[3:34:06] DocsMistake: @Towelliee you are a druid, you dont need a FP to get to moonglade
[3:34:12] magemaster225: you couldnt even get into ulduar fore half the tier, it was instance bugged
[3:34:14] realdevv: Mimiron Hardmode pre-nerf was really hard i did it
[3:34:15] chadleyhank: I love this server man have made lots of great friends so far have had nothing but good experience with hammer squad
[3:34:21] Maego1: Firefighter PepeLaugh
[3:34:26] zechetto: Ulduar was not "easy" for me back then...  Today it might, since I leanerd to look for strategies online...  LOL
[3:34:35] Felrane: I really loved 10 man raids
[3:34:40] DocsMistake: you have teleport: moonglade though
[3:34:41] Tyrammus84: do you think for wrath classic they will remove the limited attempts
[3:34:42] DocsMistake: lol
[3:34:43] Felrane: Ulduar 10 man some really good memories
[3:35:15] TheUnknowing: Honestly now a days everything will be easy, even TBC will be easy cause we have all the knowledge on it or the knowledge is easily accessible

[3:35:31] veryhairyheyyall: Loving the music insomniacClapped insomniacClapped
[3:35:44] CADZtv: i mean LK took a whole month and then 2 months for second
[3:35:50] realdevv: Nowadays people would just have 5 chars each and do many more practice attempts before the main raid.
[3:35:50] Tegin7: warrior tanking in tbc i remember being a nightmare
[3:36:11] zechetto: CONTENT!  LK had a shit ton of content
[3:36:16] sultan_of_sauce91: no other mmo has i think right?
[3:36:16] 2FiveOh: Wrath was definitely the glory days of WoW for me, just a young buck SeemsGood

[3:36:27] TheUnknowing: Wrath had the most subs and I think it did well because it was more casual. The lich king lore helped it obviously
[3:36:34] b_l_i_z_z_y: at least TBC raids are pre nerf..theylll still get dropped but for casual fun i think theyll be fun to do and more challenging than classic post nerf ones.
[3:36:50] DocsMistake: content pacing after Ulduar finally released was decent, and only really annoying raid after that was how bad Ruby Sanctum was lol

[3:37:29] JerBoody: Wrath was a pretty bad expansion when directly compared to most others...the timing and the community at that particular point in time is why it was great
[3:37:33] alex12645: i rember seeing a lot of warrior tanks with shield and sword in tbc
[3:37:39] coffeeatm: Tbc will run on the lastest Patch that hit tbc so most of the fights will bee nerfed not un nerfed
[3:37:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:38:02] DocsMistake: also the fact that they added multiple new dungeons/heroics over the course of the expac was pretty sweet imo, even if the ICC 5 mans were kind of busted
[3:38:19] JerBoody: Imagine if Blizzard recycled a raid for the first tier of a new expansion nowadays
[3:38:22] b_l_i_z_z_y: No they said theyre gonna have the un nerfed raids.
[3:38:27] coffeeatm: No
[3:38:29] b_l_i_z_z_y: unless they already changed their stance
[3:38:41] coffeeatm: They said game balance will have the leastest patch hit tbc

[4:54:01] maddogbg27: @Towelliee Main problem is that people do not have the time to spend that much time in MMO people that made WOW what WOW is were in their early 20s when wow was in its prime like BC and WOLK those people are in their mid 30s now and have jobs and other things to do
[4:54:03] obbi87: @Towelliee no blizzard just focus on the wrong things. Less loot is not = more RPG. What we miss is, RPG elements like attuments (Never going to happen agaion) Or  How you learn Dark iron Bar, you where not guided to it, you found it, LIKE and RPG!
[4:54:06] astraone: @Reap14 Have you never played any game more than once?
[4:54:20] wvivar: Anyone played Knights Online?
[4:54:22] Heekss: The idea of Wildstar was so promising
[4:54:40] Scubaskot: @Towelliee the problem is that once you gave something out, u cannot take it back. and thats what blizz did
[4:54:43] Reap14: I have played games more than once but not any mmo content.
[4:55:24] Reap14: I mean shit Blizzard can do this forever. Are people really satisfied with doing the same content over and over?
[4:55:36] Fragglevision: yep
[4:55:38] Fragglevision: years later
[4:55:40] Reap14: Thats sad

[4:55:58] astraone: What's sad about doing something you enjoy?
[4:56:06] Reap14: You sure about that?
[4:56:11] Fragglevision: yep

[4:56:25] Cryttan: It will die Kappa
[4:56:28] Fragglevision: probably not
[4:56:33] obbi87: @Reap14 how is that sad? you go to the same job every day, 70% of your day is the same thing. Is life then sad? no ofc not
[4:56:37] karaxis: i guess wrath will be the last classic expansion
[4:56:44] evangarstorm: he knows
[4:57:01] sultan_of_sauce91: they shoulf ladderit like diablo
[4:57:01] Reap14: No it will never die. There are people that are willing to play it no matter what.
[4:57:11] Noshpan: Death is more likely to die first
[4:57:22] Pallananana: Just go classic+ alrdy and put the sword of a thousand truths in game KEKW
[4:57:48] Fragglevision: is it sad to do something you enjoy?
[4:58:16] Cryttan: @Towelliee As long as it's still the #1 mmo it ptobably won't die but do you think they would put it in "sleeper mode" or whatever they call heroes of the storm if any of the new mmo's surpass it?
[4:58:28] Reap14: I gotta admit part of me wants to go though TBC again because it was one of the best mmo experiences I have had
[4:58:38] karaxis: @Pallananana you can't put that in. it's too strong
[4:58:48] Fragglevision: dont go back on what you said now, Reap14
[4:58:53] Fragglevision: xD
[4:58:55] Reap14: I am not going back on it man
[4:58:56] MrEvilRex: if Wow dies it will be because of the business model/decision not because they would've run out of story. Their current model is making business direction is generating more money from less players. Without player growth this approach will end up reducing the player base...
[4:59:20] astraone: @Reap14 I played TBC back in the day but only really raided Kara, so there's so much I just didn't see first time around, i'm excited for that.
[4:59:32] Reap14: Like I said people will play WoW no matter what state it is in..so yea it will never die
[4:59:46] DoubleNova: how many people probably have subs that they don't even know they are still subbed
[4:59:50] Fragglevision: there will be people who will play that hadn't started playing yet
[4:59:52] Reap14: Kara was amazing back in the day
[5:00:30] Reap14: I had a great guild back then though too so that made the experience that much better
[5:00:30] obbi87: if we count activision as a hole. then Candy crush, earn more then wow :P
[5:00:45] maddogbg27: @Towelliee Honestly i was talking to my friend i BET that 60% of wow money gain is from tokens alone

[5:03:54] Fragglevision: we can only hope
[5:03:54] Reap14: FFXIV is better for me at this point.
[5:04:04] Bieflapjes: other mmo's dont have the staying power as wow
[5:04:05] Sufugo: archeage was great
[5:04:06] laughing_octopus: wildstar dude
[5:04:11] Endless_Rats: Also, I used to play lots of MMO's but when I went back to retail.. it was so brutal and lonely for basically a new player
[5:04:23] Dylan19_93: i wish the raids (and ofc some more stuff) from swtor was better, that game was awesome
[5:04:26] Sufugo: Aion and archeage
[5:04:38] Reap14: XIV has been around 10 years. It isn't going anywhere.
[5:04:38] Endless_Rats: All new mmos have just been kinda boring, really
[5:04:42] Miasmus: GW2, ESO, BDO, FFO also strong but not as WoW
[5:04:56] Endless_Rats: All those games are just so boring to me :c
[5:05:00] mmrghost7: right now the best thing u can tho in wow retail and classic , is the classic leveling , relaxing af
[5:05:03] Bieflapjes: thing is also most players compare new mmo's with WoW
[5:05:15] Endless_Rats: Either no content or nothing to do or just like ESO, its a singleplayer game but always online
[5:05:16] Miasmus: New World will have decent playerbase imo
[5:05:31] browncoats: browncoats subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[5:05:31] Reap14: New World combat really brings the game down imo
[5:05:35] Heekss: Essentiel is the lore behind Warcraft, why i Think so many still a drawn this Day
[5:05:39] Endless_Rats: Ashes and New world look like they might be actually good
[5:05:52] KiLLaVuLKeN: lool
[5:05:53] Reap14: The world design in New World is so good so its a shame
[5:05:56] Kromede: towRekt
[5:06:02] astraone: Still waiting on a Warhammer 40K MMO, RIP Dark Millenium Online
[5:06:03] chubby_ch4ser: Whoops
[5:06:11] Miasmus: Ashes of Creation looks also good but mandatory sub model could be problem for it
[5:06:25] Reap14: I am not getting on the ashes hype train till I play it
[5:06:29] Endless_Rats: I honestly dont mind their sub model, I mean people pay for wow too
[5:06:49] danimoto10: how so?
[5:06:52] zechetto: why?
[5:07:10] mmrghost7: aaahhahaha yeah that will fail real quick
[5:07:11] zechetto: I never understood why wow charges for expansions
[5:07:15] Endless_Rats: I mean Ashes is like 2-3 years from release so I dont want to analyze it too much
[5:07:21] DoubleNova: huge risk
[5:07:28] ChristopherProvine: gonna be a mafia sysem in that game
[5:07:29] backalleycreep: ewwwww
[5:07:37] MrGattz: they already have a store???

[5:07:43] littlesuzu: @zechetto Why wouldn't they? :P Still sells and companies are made for making money.
[5:07:43] zechetto: well, besides "because they can"
[5:07:52] danimoto10: its gona be a store same as ff?
[5:07:56] Miasmus: The only big MMO in near future is New World
[5:08:01] Miasmus: and maybe Crimson Desert
[5:08:03] Akira_K_R: i think pantheon is gonna do better then ashes, if ashes even comes out
[5:08:09] Kulture1: ashes will fail so hard
[5:08:09] Endless_Rats: Isnt the Ashes store just basically pre-order stuff? Like cool stuff for release if you want to support the devs
[5:08:12] DoubleNova: What will come out first D4 or Ashes?
[5:08:13] MrGattz: thats like pulling an Ark. making an expansion pack before the game is even launched
[5:08:42] Reap14: I can't get into new world combat. I tried for hours.
[5:08:45] Endless_Rats: Ashes latest dev update said there should be raids or raid-tier things to do
[5:08:46] danimoto10: !uptime
[5:08:46] Moobot: Towelliee has been live for 5h 8m
[5:08:56] Kromede: star citizen will be great MiniK
[5:09:01] zechetto: littlesuzu Sure, but its a bit of double dipping, no?  I have no idea why mmo players dont care paying for the game and the service, but this would never work with other games
[5:09:10] Endless_Rats: Mostly I'm excited for Ashes having actual player interaction, I want my mmo to be a second life I live online
[5:09:17] Endless_Rats: Most mmo's dont offer that
[5:09:29] danimoto10: but isnt that just copying wow?
[5:09:40] backalleycreep: BC all day all other MMOs are beta
[5:10:01] Akira_K_R: i didnt like the combat looks of new world, to classic like its from 2005
[5:10:10] Jay_rb: Nah it was the courier pvp Quests
[5:10:14] Jay_rb: they were giving too much XP
[5:10:27] kodtheog: is it true they pushed 9.1 back again?
[5:10:29] Miasmus: They say soul-like combat for New World
[5:11:26] Kulture1: ashes will suffer that the actual gameplay loop won't be fun
[5:11:37] mayhuana: is he still playing on his paladin in sl?
[5:11:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:11:45] Cryttan: I tried final fantasy leveling was horrid
[5:11:48] kretok: Long Time lvling +open pvp jeah thats fun for working people :/
[5:11:48] Gurtington_: I never made it past lol 34? on wildstar. shit took waayyyy to long. it was a shame the combat was fun in pvp
[5:11:57] Gurtington_: level*
[5:12:05] Jay_rb: You think you do but you don't
[5:12:11] Reap14: Their end game focus may not be raiding. The game could be more about the journey.
[5:12:31] ChristopherProvine: Ashes of Mafia
[5:12:35] Miasmus: Valheim grindy made it good :)
[5:13:05] Jay_rb: kill 6,425,000 boars
[5:13:10] maddogbg27: @Towelliee 45 days of about 6 hours per day of  gameplay or maybe it was 8 hours per day
[5:13:50] Sheckly84: A new mmo has to look at shadowlands 10-50 leveling and go "we gotta beat that somehow"

[5:13:52] Kulture1: classic leveling was fun because the gameplay loop was fun, you got to use your abilities and have a fun experience - grinding is not fun. Having fun is fun
[5:13:53] MrGattz: well non subs you can link it but the bot will hit you. but at least we will still have the link :P

[5:14:11] kaelanDori: holy fuck
[5:14:14] MrGattz: thanks @CadzFPS
[5:14:16] Cypfer: WTF
[5:14:21] CADZtv: gotchu
[5:14:22] EggwithEdges: yeah, that's a nope for me
[5:14:22] sh1karov: That game is dead from release then
[5:14:22] zechetto: that cant be right
[5:14:28] Reap14: The question is what is the leveling experience like?
[5:14:29] Valoryan: indalamar's fortress
[5:14:33] astraone: So what, don't be stuck in the mentality of racing to max level
[5:14:37] bhxkazzam1: thats like wow classic
[5:14:41] miikori: Why is eveone so fixed on the endgame in every goddamn game.
[5:14:51] miikori: Or getting to the endgame in new games
[5:15:00] Reap14: Yea people are fixated on end game
[5:15:00] mythradrill: i wouldnt mind if explvling was epic
[5:15:02] CADZtv: its all tiem listed on thew bar towelliee
[5:15:06] Reap14: Its kinda sad
[5:15:09] zechetto: thats like, easily double wow classic
[5:15:11] bruhSit_farmer: yea why focus strictly on end-game and not the journey like vanilla did ??
[5:15:24] maddogbg27: @Towelliee No you are correct, their point was that because it is multi classes they want you to experience playing your character, i do agree that 45 days is a bit much

[5:15:25] Reap14: That is why people rush though XIV story and wonder why they don't understand it
[5:15:29] Kulture1: Vanilla also focused on endgame
[5:15:32] zechetto: LOL
[5:15:34] astraone: So if you're having a great time levelling, you're done because you aren't getting to max quick enough? :D
[5:15:35] Regrito: lol
[5:15:38] Gurtington_: because people say that's where they'll spend most of their time. Is at end game
[5:15:40] Flarkzz: holy fk xD
[5:15:40] Sheckly84: LOL
[5:15:40] Kromede: 45 KEKWlaugh
[5:15:42] zechetto: thats still stupid
[5:15:43] DoubleNova: Is that satire?
[5:15:47] Jay_rb: so a solid 3 weeks for no lifers KEKW
[5:15:56] TrippinballsGamming: add in 200ping
[5:15:58] Flarkzz: so ill get there in 6 month or so
[5:15:59] Cypfer: so If i play 12h a day it'll take one day
[5:15:59] maddogbg27: @Towelliee so 225 hours to hit max based on 5 hours per day
[5:16:00] Kromede: already dead
[5:16:01] Playwisme: 180-270 hours?
[5:16:08] miikori: Sure you can focus on the endgame, but its a new game.
[5:16:13] Dylan19_93: 180 to 270 hours LUL
[5:16:14] ShadoodHD: 4-6 hours... for an AVERAGE player???
[5:16:15] Miasmus: is it 45 or 4 to 5 ?
[5:16:16] Syllvn: Because you can't put in most systems until the end game when everyone is on the same level. That's just how MMOs work. So levelling will always be secondary to max level

[5:16:28] slowboi69: true but when do developers ever get that estimate right tho LUL
[5:16:31] Kulture1: 12 hours a day lmao
[5:16:31] maddogbg27: @Miasmus 45 days
[5:16:32] ShadoodHD: jesus christ do they want to end up like wildstar... miss that game btw
[5:16:36] Gurtington_: my girlfriend doesn't want me playing more than 2 hours a day. I ain't playing that game ever lmao
[5:16:37] Reap14: People think because WoW end game is raid focused all mmos have to be..and it simply isn't true
[5:16:42] mmrghost7: ppl will bounce out in a snap of a finger
[5:16:43] CADZtv: yh i see alot of people quitting cause of that
[5:16:49] Ivixia: Idk, I'm not even hyped for Ashes
[5:16:53] porowozek: 4-6 hours a day? KEKW I have maybe 2-3 hours minus weekends
[5:17:09] CADZtv: i dont let mmo's get me excited anymore after blade and soul
[5:17:20] Gurtington_: blade n soul was gross lol
[5:17:23] maddogbg27: @porowozek i guess you will take 90 days kekw
[5:17:26] Gurtington_: I was so hyped for it too
[5:17:38] Pannekaker: I still think Ashes is gonna flop, way too overhyped for an MMO
[5:17:42] CeeeKhay: Is that 4-6 per day for single or can a group of 2-3 speed up the leveling experience?
[5:17:43] ShadoodHD: time's changed SMOrc
[5:17:44] zechetto: Just imagine "Hey bro, I'm gonna start playing that game you play all the time"  "Nice dude, I'll see you in 4 months!"
[5:17:46] Reap14: Blade and soul had solid gameplay..the company that ran it was absolutely predatory thoguh
[5:18:07] CADZtv: if blade and soul had a betetr company ti wouldve done well
[5:18:13] MrGattz: man i had a lot of fun of blade and soul. even though i hate pvp focused games.
[5:18:19] Cypfer: LUL
[5:18:30] Jay_rb: I mean people buy ships in Star citizen and that game isn't out KEKW
[5:18:30] kretok: Star Citizen style with the ships
[5:18:35] andreastb: i think asmon is still hyped for ashes no?
[5:18:45] Pannekaker: Atleast you can play Star Citizen now though
[5:18:50] MrGattz: well look at star scam every citizen. people are buying thousand dollar ships and the game wont even ever be launched.
[5:18:52] CeeeKhay: Star citizen road map.
[5:19:03] Flarkzz: how does it compare to New world ?
[5:19:24] CADZtv: i do also hate how asian companies make you wait a huge length of time for a western release bns took 5 years for na/eu release
[5:19:29] bhxkazzam1: i dont really like the ui for ashes
[5:19:41] danimoto10: so waiy a minute, ashes going to need a sub to play?
[5:19:49] Dylan19_93: that hunter dmg though xD

[5:20:35] Kulture1: ashes is like if a 13 year old came up with a game idea
[5:20:37] Pannekaker: Honestly not too jazzed about the art style of Ashes either
[5:20:37] Big_Joyce: Pyramid scheme lol :D
[5:20:41] Gurtington_: fuck bdo,  fuck blade n soul
[5:20:42] WayneG947: Morning folks

[5:20:52] MrGattz: .. didnt we all as a world agree pyramid schemes are bad?
[5:21:03] MrGattz: why are they still a thing
[5:21:06] Gurtington_: I thought so
[5:21:12] Jay_rb: @MrGattz Not bad if you're at the top KEKW
[5:21:13] CADZtv: yh it looks horrid
[5:21:15] CeeeKhay: So they’re building in a product shill/salesman into the marketing?
[5:21:21] Cypfer: All these MMOs look like they were made 10 years ago
[5:21:27] Gurtington_: cause people are dumb and don't realize they're in a pyramid scheme
[5:21:28] maddogbg27: @CadzFPS lol dont blame you, i have a fiend who plays is for pvp mainly but he still spends a lot of time gringing
[5:21:31] cavers95: Ashes?
[5:21:33] CADZtv: wow retail looks better then ashes imo
[5:21:41] danimoto10: lol
[5:21:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[5:22:14] roh_gamu: @drmabusee they got the money for it, $500 is nothing
[5:22:14] Pannekaker: This sort of "realistic" art style just doesn't work for an MMO, it will look old and dated immediately
[5:22:47] plumpus81: i can't even play shadowlands 4-6 minutes a day

[5:24:24] CeeeKhay: @towelliee At this stage of the game, do you consider yourself as a player of wow or a curator of the game?
[5:24:39] carlos9949: just put your brutosaur and sell stuff
[5:24:46] Wulfgrym: i tried outriders the other day, i preordered, i was going to play the tank but the trickster class looks super awesome
[5:24:48] roh_gamu: @sultan_of_sauce91 it's nothing like destiny, its more like Remnant and Gears
[5:25:05] Cypfer: Outriders is Anthem without the mech suits?
[5:25:18] roh_gamu: @Cypfer more Remnant than Anthem
[5:25:27] sultan_of_sauce91: thats kinda cool ima look into it

[5:26:02] Wulfgrym: I get the, I like the game play feel
[5:26:05] Gurtington_: anthems combat was actually nice
[5:26:07] CeeeKhay: @towelliee You’re much more than a player. You care about the health and welfare of the game. Including the ecosystem and the longevity of the franchise.
[5:26:09] danimoto10: guys what happend to tow light?
[5:26:32] Wulfgrym: @danimoto10 his light for stream i think is off for his skin
[5:26:39] danimoto10: ohhhh
[5:26:44] Big_Joyce: @Towelliee What do you think of Amazons new MMO?
[5:26:54] Cypfer: That will only happen when Blizzard shuts down WoW servers
[5:26:55] Wulfgrym: @danimoto10 its temp
[5:27:24] drmabusee: wow is hell of a drug
[5:27:42] Gurtington_: swtor was my fucking jam. just like Wow. but star wars
[5:27:46] Flarkzz: @Towelliee why is New world not upthere with wow ? i havn't been keeping up on it.
[5:27:50] mayhuana: yeah its acutally impossible these days to create a mmo that beats wow idk too much history with wow
[5:27:55] zechetto: But that was SW
[5:27:56] TheCliffyShow: Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Just try to tweak it.
[5:28:00] Playwisme: ahh swtor, wow with lightsabres
[5:28:04] Kromede: 0.1 FPS on illum
[5:28:08] judgejbrown: Swtor was so bad becuase of the engine
[5:28:09] magemaster225: blizzard should have hit on a starcraft mmo, or even a starcraft looter shooter at this point
[5:28:22] Cypfer: LoL MMO soon (tm)
[5:28:30] XshadowturkeyX: crucible was fun just needed more time to be worked on
[5:28:39] Ivixia: New World is not even out yet
[5:28:42] drmabusee: what is saw from new world it was not an mmo
[5:28:44] drRoswell: never wasted my time with anything other then wow its pointless
[5:28:45] CeeeKhay: @towelliee You have a decade plus playing WoW. I think that’s the player base they’re looking for someone who’ll be in the game for the same exact things you’re passionate about WoW.
[5:28:48] zechetto: LoL MMO would be weird as fuck
[5:28:52] TheCliffyShow: @magemaster225 I was conceived Titan was a Starcraft MMO until I found out Overwatch was created from it.
[5:28:53] Gurtington_: do you still take less fall damage in cat form in classic?
[5:29:09] Cypfer: @zechetto they are still making it though LUL
[5:29:26] zechetto: @Pocketmitti Yes, but you need to buy a passive for that, level 35+ or some shit like that
[5:29:36] Akira_K_R: for me, mmos are pretty much over, i put over 10yrs in WoW, and loved every bit of it, but all in all, mmos just have changed for the worse imo
[5:29:49] XshadowturkeyX: omg a starcraft mmo would be amazing
[5:29:58] Cypfer: After so many years of WoW I can't play MMOs anymore i'm gased
[5:30:06] CeeeKhay: @towelliee if the in game eco system is what they said it will be then the leveling and the grind won’t really matter.
[5:30:25] Gurtington_: so I got a new  p.c. coming in a week or two. if I'm subbed to retail wow will I also be able to try out classic  with the same account?
[5:30:30] Akira_K_R: one thing tho i would like to see WoW do is somthing with their mounts, other then looks, theres 100s if not 1,000s of mounts in the game, make something specail about wach one
[5:30:37] Gurtington_: haven't played since early bfa
[5:30:39] MrGattz: @Pocketmitti yes
[5:30:46] Kulture1: new riot mmo?
[5:30:48] Cryttan: @Towelliee  Is outriders looking good?
[5:30:53] grim777777: they need a mm0 you can crank 90s in @Towelliee
[5:30:57] EggwithEdges: Wildstar could been something, I enjoyed it
[5:30:59] Lantern214: MMo's take a full year to fully mature @Towelliee
[5:31:02] Gurtington_: @mrgattz OK dope, appreciate it
[5:31:06] drmabusee: the two week hype happens with every game right now
[5:31:07] MrGattz: np
[5:31:20] CADZtv: a new mmo should release it like apex did

[5:33:51] mayhuana: the biggest problem i have with aother mmos is the fighting system idk wow classes are so clean and the animations are good
[5:33:53] kodtheog: is that the only expectations we have left now for this year :(
[5:34:03] MrGattz: it wasnt a bad game either. to bad they shut down
[5:34:04] CeeeKhay: @towelliee It looks as Ashes is trying to meld game play with tribalism and RP which if they can pull it off should have a sustainable macro, micro and ecosystem.
[5:34:32] CeeeKhay: It’s ambitious and i hope they can make it enjoyable.
[5:34:35] xippehh: Anyone know the name of his XP bar add on?

[5:37:10] Mheerkat: People have so much sunk cost in WoW (time or moneywise), they always somehow find excuses to come back to it, not to throw it all away. NEW MMOs can't flourish in that because people aren't yet invested in them and a simple fault is enough to let it die without a second chance. As long as the "safe haven" of  returning to WoW exists, new MMOs will not have a steady even if slow population growth. (MY honest opinion, may be false)
[5:37:11] TacticalWee: @trogath it's luxthos xp bar weakaura updated for classic
[5:37:21] kodtheog: riot is our only hope

[5:38:04] disrespectful_chatter: yes
[5:38:05] Dylan19_93: yeah, no lvl requirement
[5:38:10] kukli0: riot is gonna do an mmo like gw2
[5:38:11] CADZtv: riot doesnt have an ego they arent scared to copy another mmo just like fortnite ent scared to copy things from other BR's

[5:39:02] KiLLaVuLKeN: ghost
[5:39:03] drRoswell: riot coppied everything from w3
[5:39:04] Supers18: Greg cradled Ion back in early wow days
[5:39:06] kodtheog: it should have sleepless nights with how bad shadowlands is OMEGALUL
[5:39:10] Mheerkat: if WoW doesn't die, a new MMO flourish is unlikely in the likes of the past
[5:39:12] Supers18: ion quaking in his boots
[5:39:14] Mheerkat: unfortunately
[5:39:30] BadXo: Really, REALLY want a competative MMO to WoW right now

[5:39:43] kodtheog: shadowlands = TBC waiting room
[5:39:59] Ayoojimmy: Whats the easiest way to find people for dungeons in classic?
[5:40:01] Supers18: Im so bored of SL im playin FF14 YIKES

[5:40:13] kodtheog: @Supers18 felt
[5:40:15] CADZtv: bte isnt the new mmo based around league? cause what ghost said in his tweet
[5:40:21] CADZtv: btw
[5:40:26] Galadeon: Realistically the Riot MMO is still like 4 years away
[5:40:40] CADZtv: oh yh mmo require time
[5:40:45] KiLLaVuLKeN: ye he left and look what happened KEKW

[5:41:09] Contendedlemon: damn son, this server quiet af
[5:41:21] KiLLaVuLKeN: @drRoswell no he was lead systems designer overall
[5:41:28] MrGattz: yeah this server is pretty small on purpose

[5:42:10] bhxkazzam1: all i remember from ghost, is that he was super active in forums which was nice
[5:42:18] idenkaz_: who own half the world
[5:42:25] beckett3a: tencent the kajilionaire company
[5:42:36] magemaster225: 10 cent needs to upgrade there name to 20 cent by now
[5:42:52] Lantern214: Micro transactions are fine if the game is ftp
[5:42:54] MrGattz: well if its anything like LoL then all the micros are gonna be about 100 skins for each class
[5:43:02] zechetto: more, even
[5:43:04] sultan_of_sauce91: and hes making an mmo?
[5:43:09] Mheerkat: with this much sunk cost combined from people in WoW, a little mistake along the way, people will return to WoW in a heartbeat
[5:43:12] CADZtv: tencent 69 billion lol
[5:43:28] Galadeon: Lots of armor transmogs will be for sale like Blade n Soul
[5:43:29] TheCliffyShow: Wil the Riot MMO be League of Legends based on something new?
[5:43:41] deerp_tv: Think it will be better than wow? with micro transactions?
[5:43:42] KiLLaVuLKeN: more like he will design a good MMO and tencent will destroy it with their greed
[5:43:43] Kulture1: @TheCliffyShow probably league
[5:43:52] MrGattz: idk. do we know what universe the riot mmo is in?
[5:43:52] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:43:52] kukli0: i wonder what budget will be allocated to the mmo, bc i feel like mmos are a dying genre and they still have their cashcows to milk aka league
[5:44:00] drRoswell: i'm excited to see him getting sacked once again XD
[5:44:00] DoubleNova: Is there a prediction on D4 release?
[5:44:06] drmabusee: they already created a league universe
[5:44:08] romoleus: The game may be good but isn't the genre on a downturn in the type of game people play?
[5:44:08] Supers18: Towelliee SWTOR was good competition for wow in the beginning
[5:44:20] MrGattz: @DoubleNova nope. probly holiday this year or mid next year
[5:44:22] Ponickz: best blue post ever
[5:44:30] Galadeon: FF is good comp right now
[5:44:45] PvtHudson093: the epic mount for pally needs one
[5:44:51] Merlin840: the closest competition WoW had was Rift
[5:44:54] Ponickz: he would make trolls look like complete asses
[5:45:32] Galadeon: And Greg loved to buff paladins. 😉
[5:45:37] MrGattz: oh ok cool
[5:45:42] Lantern214: @Towelliee He had a spine unlike todays wow devs
[5:45:42] zechetto: For sure
[5:45:56] TheCliffyShow: If the Riot MMO is based on League, I would definitely play it. The game has some interesting looking characters. I just don't care about MOBAs.
[5:46:06] magemaster225: all those old blizzard devs were trolls, kaplan, afrasiabi etc
[5:46:30] drRoswell: @Galadeon you being sarcastic? you know he nearly destroyed paladins
[5:46:33] deekayed: same universe
[5:46:37] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @kaeod (warning)
[5:46:40] zechetto: yep, runeterra
[5:46:44] magemaster225: it was part of there 7 League IP announcement a few years back
[5:46:59] kodtheog: its on the website you can see it there
[5:47:19] TheCliffyShow: It would get them more players if it was based on League. That's name recognition for the casuals.
[5:47:31] Supers18: Towelliee where is Tom Chilton dude, he was director for ages
[5:47:34] drmabusee: i mean wow came after wc3 and it was all like, yeah i'll play that. league is making the same approach.
[5:47:47] Kromede: 3.50 Kappa
[5:47:49] KiLLaVuLKeN: i mean tanks in pvp, specifically arena .. just awful
[5:47:53] sultan_of_sauce91: they have a lot of capitol to start with for sure
[5:47:53] CADZtv: i think basing it league is a much safer idea and better honestly
[5:47:57] Jay_rb: I mean Riot has great writers, Their lore will be great
[5:47:59] CADZtv: on
[5:48:02] DoubleNova: they have so many avenues of revenue too
[5:48:02] MrGattz: its not hard.. they just have to have rewarding content
[5:48:31] Cyberangel89: @Towelliee RIFT WAS THE BEST MMO
[5:48:32] drRoswell: yeah riot has no chance against acti/blizz
[5:48:38] Cyberangel89: only one better than WOW
[5:48:41] kodtheog: i think this was always their plan  they built a huge universe with tons of backstories that will translate really well into the mmo
[5:48:43] Jay_rb: Loot better drop when you do content
[5:48:53] CADZtv: riot has a good chancve against bliizard acti honestly
[5:49:20] TheCliffyShow: League of Legends is an IP that could challenge WoW.
[5:49:44] Ayoojimmy: Whats the easiest way to find people for dungeons in classic
[5:49:48] BadXo: Has Bonfire Studios ever announced anything? Want to know what Rob Pardo and his team are building
[5:49:52] CADZtv: yh riot has a good story with league like wow does
[5:50:03] CADZtv: background
[5:50:21] Kulture1: does league actually have a good story, i don't think that is true
[5:50:23] theszoti: maybe riot's mmo will be in league's universe
[5:50:23] idenkaz_: @BadXo webite forum. dev post. your welcome.
[5:50:28] kodtheog: @Kulture1 yes
[5:50:30] Reap14: No other mmo will compete with XIV story. They should stick to raiding.
[5:50:45] kodtheog: league has great lore
[5:50:58] CADZtv: im gnna be real i find final story boriing
[5:51:01] desmo7: leagues lore looks random af

[6:24:20] MrGattz: also people might just be waiting to make tanks and healers for when belfs drop
[6:24:26] ArcaneSyntax: dont worry theres gonna be like 9000 paladins day 1 of prepatch
[6:24:27] TacticalWee: i'm leveling a  shaman healer
[6:24:36] Hmm1524: Tanks went extinct long ago
[6:24:52] cleanstrikes: 15-18
[6:24:58] cleanstrikes: Oh for naxx?
[6:25:17] TheUnknowing: You'll have me as a tank in tbc atleast @towelliee im 41 in classic at the moment
[6:25:31] cleanstrikes: 5 or 6 healers and 3 tanks per raid
[6:25:35] falldrgn: 230/375 not bad
[6:25:45] vuurmannetje: Tanks were never in big supply
[6:25:46] cleanstrikes: That would be nice
[6:25:58] TheUnknowing: I imagine the boost will work like it does in retail
[6:25:59] Abbat16: are u for or against lvl boost in classic
[6:26:05] Lazugo: you know what, i have the same feeling
[6:26:19] Valzark: they cant do that or what would make it not new? what play it for 5 mins
[6:26:33] Nilpointnil: just boost a bunch of tanks & heals
[6:26:54] Shrenko: @Nilpointnil you only have 1 boost
[6:26:55] vuurmannetje: Problem is you kinda gotta like tanking/healing
[6:27:08] vuurmannetje: just having the class/spec doesnt make you want to do it :P
[6:27:50] Shrenko: catJAM
[6:28:53] dmhd2: That frame that shows time to level and other info, is it an addon?

[6:28:57] MrGattz: hey @Towelliee so here's a funny story. that app actually doesnt have a raiding position on it.. which was probly an oversight. maybe we should redo it.
[6:29:08] Ohdies: I loved bc resto druid. #treeform
[6:29:20] vuurmannetje: And you will always be whispered for heroic groups
[6:29:38] PvtHudson093: I loved being a Holy pala from vanilla to wrath but after cata i just didnt like healing anymore
[6:29:49] Quakezilla69: i think prot pally and bear best combo
[6:30:04] TheUnknowing: Thats what I was thinking @MrGattz i was like 'im pretty sure when i filled that out it didnt have a position spot'
[6:30:35] Shrenko: boofs
[6:30:43] vuurmannetje: With our guild well run Prot War 1 - Prot Pala 2 and Feral as dedicated OT/kitty. Then possibly swap the war for a druid in sunwell
[6:31:10] MrGattz: @TheUnknowing well at first the app was just meant to be like "heyy who wants to actually participate in tbc raiding?" because we didnt think it would be THIS many people. 315 applications later and 500+ people already in the guild..
[6:31:19] Boomie82: i saved all my dkp back in tbc for ashes of alar as a bear tank because of no competition. was fun :P
[6:31:24] TheUnknowing: @MrGattz Yeah I know xD
[6:31:50] Noshpan: That was cold spicy
[6:31:50] Nilpointnil: usually guilds have dpk decay
[6:32:11] MrGattz: knowing what i know now i think its a good idea to redo it. have it more structured. remove the applications that are just people that want to join the guild and have it more focused on who actually wants to raid
[6:32:30] TheUnknowing: I'm not sure we will be using dkp, its kind of a dated system and was kind of shit back then but who knows, i dont think towel has figured out what loot system we will use yet
[6:32:53] mewkittymon: No
[6:32:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:33:15] Shrenko: LootCouncil?
[6:33:18] TheUnknowing: I think loot council is probably the best way to go personally
[6:33:34] onyx_pupper: roll and pray
[6:33:34] alex12645: could just make them roll on the item
[6:33:38] PvtHudson093: old school dkp
[6:33:39] TheUnknowing: I mean, could always go old fashion /roll lol
[6:33:41] AureliusXV: its classic lol
[6:33:58] Lokajin: just do like 2 soft res and leave it there
[6:33:59] MrGattz: @Towelliee we have https://softres.it/
[6:33:59] Lokajin: ez to manage
[6:34:09] MrGattz: which is what we have been using
[6:34:25] Lokajin: ya softres is ezlife
[6:34:26] mewkittymon: Use the roll mane before off etc
[6:34:28] MrGattz: it works.
[6:34:28] byrdeen45: remeber all gear is hunter gear
[6:34:42] TheOfficialGimp: My guild always just does MS>OS /roll, makes life easy and no one can complain
[6:34:43] dmhd2: Hey towelliee, the time to level frame is it an addon?
[6:34:51] Shrenko: AngelThump
[6:34:57] albertocofi: But the best option for sure is, without a shadow of a doubt, personal loot
[6:35:09] albertocofi: Kappa
[6:35:26] alex12645: do that in bc you make people mad so fast saying all gear hunter gear

[6:37:15] Cracktagg: No Glaives for the rogues , DIRGE is for the rogues LUL
[6:37:24] vuurmannetje: 2nd glaive is gonna be mine if I play war
[6:37:35] Overbuilt_Gaming: and give the sunwell bow to the rouge KEKW
[6:37:36] IVIDH: rogues should just be happy to get a slot in raid group in TBC Kappa
[6:38:01] Squidnapped: lookin good towelliee my man hope all is well
[6:38:09] Bigmann109: did people know the glaves were coming in BC? or are we going to see a baby boom of rogues now
[6:38:18] vuurmannetje: one thing people forget when they see some classes top is that they also get the fulltime BL rotation
[6:38:29] FrostWolfOSRS: @Bigmann109 probably not
[6:38:51] alex12645: lol
[6:38:56] TheUnknowing: No they cant sadly
[6:38:56] Lokajin: only rogue warrior
[6:39:14] Nilpointnil: you need to loot it just in case to make sure

[6:44:32] Lokajin: @Exodeo_ were in the same boat 5/10 progging inerva pull 37 best attempt was 8%, sunking was our hardest boss so far 108ish pulls.
[6:44:49] Lazugo: you just need to watch blizzcon panel and you see that they dont have shit ready for 9.1
[6:44:49] idenkaz_: 6-8 weeks?
[6:44:51] mmrghost7: 2 months max
[6:44:52] magemaster225: 2.5 months ez

[6:45:50] Lokajin: @Exodeo_ ya we went the reverse route did sunking first, xymox and now working on inerva honestly inerva was the easiest so far we probably would of killed her if i wasnt absent the night we got her to 8% im the top boomkin on the team xD.

[6:46:15] Llamatude: 9.1 will wait for FFXIV xpac to drop
[6:46:22] mewkittymon: BC first
[6:46:22] zeiours: @towelliee Which would you want first?
[6:46:24] Exodeo_: @Lokajin Aha, we're working on Xymoz ourselves, recruitment is a big struggle though as we're on a low pop server
[6:46:25] bollemons0: How long does beta usually last?
[6:46:27] Chrisfo79: If BC comes first I will 100% play it until 9.1
[6:46:34] idenkaz_: so much to retail will always be prio for blizzard, my ass
[6:46:35] Lazugo: @Llamatude New world actually
[6:46:52] Llamatude: @Lazugo if that comes out lol
[6:46:55] Boomie82: bc in june and 9.1 in august sounds alright
[6:47:15] Gizimoo86: i hope they dont rush BC to get it out before retail patches
[6:47:21] Lokajin: @Exodeo_ ya were struggling to keep a consistent roster for every raid night people getting burnt out and shit and constantly subbing in people to fill for absences.  Its definitely draining. We havent had our full starting roster for a single night of raiding in like a month lol
[6:47:45] mewkittymon: I was thinking late July that about 13 weeks
[6:47:50] bollemons0: Do you think BC can take more than 4 months to come out?
[6:48:00] AureliusXV: i hope they do
[6:48:08] Exodeo_: @Lokajin We've been fortunate that a bunch of socials stepped up at the right time, and the n1 guild on the server sent some excess raiders our way to help too
[6:48:11] Llamatude: can this game withstand that long of a content drought?
[6:48:16] Madnezz123: @Towelliee  what would you play if they would come out together?
[6:48:32] Traveler_103: like naxx and nathria :D but much worse
[6:48:35] Jermo11: they already said TBC pre-patch will be longer
[6:48:45] R2RHIN0: Hey @Towelliee  I'm going to Vegas tomorrow! Any Restaurants you recommend?
[6:48:51] vuurmannetje: if prepatch 18 may still on schedule its pretty much confirmed
[6:48:51] belfastcl: not a bad time to try out other games
[6:48:53] LSBreed: @llamatude it survived WOD
[6:49:05] AureliusXV: vegas is dirty
[6:49:06] twistedstick1: Show me the money.
[6:49:10] ShadoodHD: as long as tbc is good and ready in beta im gucchi
[6:49:10] Cartharon: june TBC aug 9.1 would be ok i think
[6:49:13] vakaarian: what was the longest time between a .0 to .1 before?
[6:49:18] Squidnapped: So true... Blizzcon didnt show us ANYTHING for ANYTHING. all fluff.
[6:49:18] bollemons0: Honestly players are also in this weird spot, we dont got TBC or 9.1, we got nothing to do but waiting
[6:49:23] Llamatude: @LSBreed barely... it lost a lot of people.
[6:49:28] LSBreed: time to catch up on all those other games you ever thought of playing
[6:49:59] desmo7: diablo immortal
[6:50:05] Upski: other games?
[6:50:14] Chrisfo79: @LSBreed I finally got started with  The Outer Worlds :D
[6:50:20] LSBreed: @llamatude Wow is like field of dreams. "build it and they will come."
[6:50:23] Lazugo: outriders baby
[6:50:28] deathrift991: getting fucked by covid again? Whats new.
[6:50:41] Squidnapped: Outriders comes out tomorrow, yeah?
[6:50:56] Squidnapped: console? D: booo! lol
[6:51:00] bollemons0: Towelliee are you going resto druid or balance in TBC?
[6:51:09] Mortal_Wombat_: outriders was in game pass right?
[6:51:14] LSBreed: fucking lul
[6:51:16] Squidnapped: for console gamepass only
[6:51:17] Llamatude: @LSBreed with WOD there was no competition.. if they wait till aug you have FFXIV new xpac, you have new world, mortal II
[6:51:17] Moobot: Calm the spam, @gryn (warning)
[6:51:21] Lazugo: @SquiddsyTV https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/581424849445060617/824730052875780126/Outriders_Broadcast_Schedulev11.jpg?width=910&height=910 hers dude

[6:53:27] Mike__Ro: GG'S
[6:53:29] LSBreed: @llamatude that's true, but with more people competing in rwf than ever, and with all their sponsors,  I think that will always drive a big return to the game.
