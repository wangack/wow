[1:03:01] dudatron: you get a question if you'd like to use the ankh
[1:03:02] Scharkov: just bm and win vs frostshock

[1:07:41] NOHITJEROME: everyone smart seems to be ranking LUL
[1:07:56] Gizimoo86: yep
[1:08:01] Astrosparkle: People are going Alliance for PvE since the raids are harder.
[1:08:03] Capnrein: horde quests are more running back and forth long distances is why alli levels faster
[1:08:54] Astrosparkle: The PvE'ers are alliance for Paladins to make the harder raids easier and the PvPers want to play with their friends and other good players.
[1:08:56] Capnrein: you leveling to 40 today or just BG's?
[1:09:01] sheerheartattackyk: easier is boting tbh, harder is way better for a challenge
[1:09:05] sheerheartattackyk: boring*
[1:09:21] DrizzTV: 
[1:09:26] ChetSteele: What’s the highest rank you can get at 39? 6?
[1:09:26] Zelrise: thats because alliance are smart and wait until 49 and dont waste time quing below that lvl
[1:09:31] hades_tm: again full of premates in bg´s?
[1:09:41] DrizzTV: swiftyPblush

[1:10:48] ChetSteele: You can get 14 at 59

[1:16:23] diabl712: @dudatron meta is different than 60
[1:16:54] neevir: you need weak aura for sting
[1:16:55] elthegart: i have a healeer
[1:17:13] AStrawHat: People enjoy less abilities, having better gear than their opposition, and winning based on that.

[1:18:20] dudatron: @diabl712 got it, thanks man :D
[1:18:28] MonkikoBytes: @dudatron yeah it's basically a challenge or a change of pace
[1:18:40] WalkOff: and it completely killed twinking lol
[1:19:05] Qman157: it killed the twinking.
[1:19:08] dudatron: @MonkikoBytes I got it now, I always got confused of the point of it, but now I might try it out :D
[1:19:09] Forbes02: so is twinking still a big thing on live wow
[1:19:34] AStrawHat: Twinking needs to be separated from non-twinks imo. Nothing kills a BG bracket faster than twinks stomping people because of their gear.
[1:19:43] dudatron: They should probably add the NPC for shutting xp in SoM

[3:58:34] D1rtyBurger: toxiccc
[3:58:38] indivisible37: I work with litium ion batteries regularly, THE APPLE issue was, when batteries get older there becomes an internal resisteance, over time, reducing voltage/amperage from the battery, and APPLE was saying it was their way of preventing that, which makes zero sense.
[3:58:42] thamysticog: poor wars
[3:59:04] delicioustoast4: @FreddieTheFifth anything cool you can do with that?
[3:59:34] MearXee: Why arent you using davinci resolve

[6:32:10] Zerratule: New World is a Beta game released before it was finished - full of game breaking bugs and serious design flaws.  If you're hard core PvP and that's all you care about - you might enjoy it enough to overlook the huge mess of a game it currently is.  It's NOT an MMO by any serious definition of the term.

[11:40:10] Worthrain: 60 is most fun but you need gear
[11:40:14] Rafthehalf: i think focus on getting 51 then grind out av for levels and honor at same time and av rep BIS for the items
[11:40:15] BiggcombsTV: My guild told me to skip 49 and pvp some between 51 and 60 in av
[11:40:19] onyxthefortuitous420: yeah get 60 so you can do AV
[11:40:20] noxlr: hi swifty! quick question. Why are you in south shore, when you do the quests? and not in Origmar?

[11:52:56] sonartwitchtv: Cathedral
[11:52:56] Divinelust: Ungoro at higher lvl around 54-55, tanaris is better to lvl if u wanna quest
[11:52:57] Hyelander_: Cath is highest
[11:52:57] TheHastycakes: Cathedral
[11:52:58] 123zoki123: uldaman is from 41
[11:52:59] drenakan: Get the Ulda quests and do that at 41

[11:53:20] Sunyankzi: Uldaman.
[11:53:21] Gizimoo86: Yeah uldmaman if need
[11:53:21] Chosey: uldaman
[11:53:23] 123zoki123: uLDAMAN
[11:53:23] l3nshizzle: dont do uld
[11:53:24] Divinelust: Uldaman sucks dont go there haha
[11:53:25] Hyelander_: Uldaman
[11:53:29] HeIlraiser_: WOW
[11:53:34] TheHastycakes: Yea, dungeon in Badlands
[11:53:35] rookie286: ulda is fun and ez
[11:53:39] drenakan: He has a group
[11:53:41] unsqueezable: badlands dungeon
[11:53:41] roobellium: Good Morning!! You still awake?! I've been asleep and got back! XD
[11:53:42] drenakan: ez quests
[11:53:42] Aruze2014: uldaman 45
[11:53:46] 123zoki123: uldaman but its boring dungeon
[11:53:48] drenakan: tons of help so he can run anything
[11:53:51] Bigmace: how can you not know, you've played this game for over a decade LUL
[11:53:52] deeeepx: where u get impendium doom
[11:53:53] unsqueezable: gives a massive quest at the end where you click some discs
[11:53:54] deeeepx: offhand
[11:53:59] rookie286: tons of ulda quests do it for that
[11:54:00] Hyelander_: Dont listen to them Uldaman is great. it has 2 entrances for lower and higher level
[11:54:01] TheHastycakes: It has a decent number of quests. It's not bad, but I usually run it only once.
[11:54:04] unsqueezable: think you get like 10k xp from just the turnin of that
[11:54:15] Divinelust: You can do STV quests to 44 or go to tanaris until 44/45, those quests are pretty easy, then ZF into BRD is the play 100%
[11:54:18] zwapy: uldaman was hard when it launched, but people know what to do know
[11:54:20] drenakan: Focus on all the Dung quests
[11:54:21] deeeepx: get skull of impendium doom ?
[11:54:25] drenakan: then grind in ZF
[11:54:29] unsqueezable: and thats without mastery so you'd get way more
[11:54:38] rfui: you're the man
[11:54:41] Gizimoo86: press I it shows what instance range your character is
[11:54:46] lvl2roguestuckinthetavern: I'm pretty sure that disc quest is at the end of the dungeon

[11:55:45] Rastafaris: hey swifty
[11:56:15] Outspec: which rank u already ?
[11:56:17] dudatron: NICE!
[11:56:17] Divinelust: 49 bracket has been dead, 19 29 39 are always popping but nothing past that seems to get attention sadly
[11:56:18] drenakan: Get to 51+ so we can sit in av homie. We'll have tons of groups going
[11:56:19] Gizimoo86: Well for me there is no BG matches 40-49 it seems people dont play it
[11:56:36] francoisdevine: You ever tried shadowlands lvl 20  f2p twinking?
[11:56:41] drenakan: Ive got so many games tonight at 49
[11:56:48] dudatron: HELL YEAH! R14 Shaman!
[11:56:58] drenakan: Not true I got 9 wins in a row tonight lvl 49
[11:57:17] Gizimoo86: I think you can get to 51 before next weekend for sure
[11:57:36] Moosfortune: Whats the bracket addon called?
[11:57:48] Scelero1: theres a lvl cap for ranks. you might not be high enough for r6
[11:57:53] smiltstomb: You can get from 40 to 60 in a week for sure
[11:57:57] Imba2424: Done already? It's not even 6Am lol
[11:58:25] Divinelust: You can realistically 1-60 in 3 days if you push it, there will be more people playing at that lvl so dungeon grind will be much easier
[11:58:28] Ajarezz: Swifty if you got Joannas quest guide youd fly through quests and level faster
[11:58:39] Divinelust: Find 2-3 warriors and melee cleave everything down
[11:59:01] roobellium: @Imba2424 He has been streaming for 12 hours XD
