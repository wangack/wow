[0:24:04] Ludviksx: Hydra is actually waiting for cata
[0:24:27] ama__deus: @Hydramist YO, did you know that the new shadowform also reduced your mana burn cost by half? I am fucking burning 500 mana for 92 KEKW It seems mad busted

[0:26:51] guidelock: thats why ur leveling NA POGGERS just clocked this
[0:27:01] ashidoxr: think we are ever getting rated pvp in sod?

[0:27:35] Sinostra: are you gonna be motivated enough to start all over gain on eu ?
[0:27:36] ama__deus: Mana burn for half mana in shadow form. Thoughts? POGGIES @Hydramist seems busted af
[0:27:39] mrbirman: no the cookies are
[0:27:44] mrbirman: ridicolous
[0:27:54] Larrytwins: hello Hydra, i just watch ur guid about ur addon but i have problem, how can i take out the timer on the dots
[0:27:58] guidelock: il figure out a SM boost KEKW

[0:29:21] ama__deus: Do you know if mind sear triggers multiple vampiric embraces in a pack of mobs hit by it? monkaHmm
[0:29:36] Larrytwins: or if anyone know the prob... i mean on my target i see the timing of my dot and i dont want it, just the empty icon is fine
[0:30:14] ephixa_fan: catJAM I cum in Ford catJAM
[0:30:22] ama__deus: Can test that. It def doesn't proc blackout on anything, but your main target
[0:30:41] ama__deus: @ephixa_fan HUH
[0:31:01] Larrytwins: i mean when u put ur dot, they dont show ur timing of ur dot
[0:31:23] Larrytwins: for me they put inside  8, then 7, 6 5 blabla ^^
[0:31:26] Landon_MDL: at what level did you respec?
[0:31:35] Larrytwins: pretty boring when u play affliction
[0:31:38] Larrytwins: i dont wanna see
[0:31:56] Larrytwins: hum i will see that thank u for the answer
[0:31:57] ama__deus: if martyrdom worked with runes, we could just run around and apply vampiric embrace for a bit (with the 10s cd), then mind sear and we'd farm like regen mages KEKW
[0:32:04] demongodxtv: still not 40 ryan what have you b een doin @Hydramist
[0:32:10] cryton1000: how much does death scale with spell power? surely not 1:1 right?

[0:33:03] Larrytwins: thank u all
[0:33:25] cryton1000: checking now
[0:33:36] HeyImArty: Hello Ryan hydraLove
[0:33:42] ama__deus: Stat weights says 0.643 coef
[0:33:50] dreeeamyy: Yoo
[0:33:51] HeyImArty: just waiting between pvp events & farming pre bis gear
[0:33:54] dreeeamyy: early stream pog
[0:33:54] HeyImArty: hydraKit
[0:34:01] Seilou: Seilou watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Dispersion already
[0:34:03] Seilou: sick
[0:34:12] murxyxd: Is Troll good for spriest?
[0:34:23] leo__ch: what's the priest build for lvling up?
[0:34:30] Schimy: Would you go 31 points in shadow for shadowform for World pvp/ stv?
[0:34:31] ama__deus: if we ever get that Sadge
[0:34:40] Toxiferous: and then at 40 you’ll have shadow talent modifiers
[0:34:44] ama__deus: I miss shadow guard hard
[0:34:51] murxyxd: Is that for aesthetic?
[0:34:56] murxyxd: or because its better?
[0:35:18] ama__deus: but yeah, my favourite thing so far in SOD is mana burn at half mana cost in shadow form EZ
[0:35:44] leo__ch: !guide
[0:35:44] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[0:36:04] elninololo69: Hi, serveur Crusader ?
[0:36:06] HeyImArty: STV pvp nerf was not well thought out
[0:36:17] ama__deus: 92 mana to burn 444 off of them? Siiiign me up EZ
[0:36:28] HeyImArty: when you respawn you get a 1min buff that u cant remove that makes u worthless coin wise
[0:36:52] HeyImArty: so the gameplay is the same, 5man grps camping ppl
[0:36:54] HeyImArty: but u get less coins per event
[0:37:42] HeyImArty: now people still get clusterfucked at the GY but arent worth coins
[0:37:44] HeyImArty: xd
[0:37:49] luzid7: you can run to other ghost they are everywhere
[0:37:59] ama__deus: I mean, you don't HAVE to get clusterfucked. Just run to your corpse, right?
[0:38:17] HeyImArty: @ama__deus 2min respawn time in a even with a 30min timer
[0:38:30] ama__deus: @HeyImArty solid argument. Yeah
[0:38:51] Freebolt: is shadow sick at 40?
[0:38:54] leo__ch: are you guys goign shadow for lvling up or disc?
[0:39:08] derrickx3: hey mate! how do you like p2 so far?
[0:39:29] HeyImArty: how do they score so many W's with SoD but anything pvp related is a L
[0:39:34] Freebolt: what runes did priest get?
[0:39:34] HeyImArty: its impressive
[0:39:42] Freebolt: have only been playing retail
[0:40:04] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:40:25] Exxii11: ngl the pvp looks garbage regardless of the event. dmg seems way too high
[0:40:36] HeyImArty: pvp event went from "clusterfuck at GY 1 event, get an item" to "clusterfuck at a GY 5-6 events, get an item"
[0:41:44] HeyImArty: they changed BGs from 25% DR to higher max HP right?
[0:42:48] murxyxd: I currently have a 25 ud and 25 troll priest, which one should I level in your opinion?
[0:43:32] HeyImArty: best part of P2 so far tho is moonkin form
[0:43:39] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[0:43:39] HeyImArty: classic moonkin form is so dumb looking its funny
[0:43:45] ama__deus: Getting the coins solo vs groups is kind of fun at least in STV
[0:44:10] l3oxi: havent gotten to play way too much myself yet,  but have you gotten one of the new runes yet?
[0:44:15] PeadertheGreat: more fun too
[0:45:16] toto_joy: hi. can you tell, what addons use you?
[0:45:26] ama__deus: Also depends how into PVE you are. Troll is BIS for parsing etc.
[0:45:41] toto_joy: thanks!
[0:46:13] linkens_here: smite spec viable at 40?
[0:46:24] demongodxtv: im from the uk ryan and ive never even heard of a rushford haha @Hydramist
[0:46:25] HeyImArty: mate dont bully my owl
[0:46:28] HeyImArty: i look glorious
[0:46:51] jordimestree: Wich talents are u lvling up ?¿
[0:47:07] ama__deus: I still hate mind spike. The only good thing is the 42y range and that you can still cast it when you're locked out of shadow
[0:48:02] Lingohh: you got world first diablo 3 60 right?
[0:48:28] skaare1: just got mind spike, it literally does more dmg than mind blast but cost a third of mana
[0:48:40] kevinrmp: mind flay ticks dont apply shadow vulnu :( only the activation of the cast
[0:48:44] Lingohh: it was three weeks!? damn
[0:48:51] ImOdyssey: holy I haven’t heard braindeadly’s name in years
[0:48:55] ama__deus: Absolutely doesn't do more damage than mind blast KEKW
[0:49:25] Lingohh: sounds like a blast
[0:49:53] Zelimeth: i saw the clip, you are not recognizable lol
[0:49:53] Lingohh: hahaha too old... but not really
[0:50:28] ama__deus: I can't rate how good the MF slow is in PVP otherwise I wouldn't even have MF on my bar at this point
[0:50:45] ama__deus: having a slow at all is probably still value
[0:51:05] Zelimeth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1TrblyFltI&t=18s&ab_channel=AtheneWins
[0:51:06] Lingohh: who other people from the wow arena community have you met irl ?

[0:59:54] momhips: SWP + mind spike x2 or x3 + mind blast + SWD =1800 damage in 6 seconds. this damage is insane and I am only level 35. Twisted faith and mind spike together are crazy

[11:02:06] Mystiggo: try one more time while mounted
[11:02:09] cryton1000: I would eliminate one at a time starting from the bottom until you get what works, or what combo works
[11:02:24] cryton1000: oh
[11:02:28] cryton1000: so only on mount
[11:02:44] Zelimeth: cancelaura mount before the disperse line
[11:02:49] Mafajazz: ^
[11:02:50] Mystiggo: but I swear you dismounted and it worked just now
