[1:42:53] Lifesvirtue: I wish titanforging stayed but awarded up to normal ilvl current content. Making old raids and world content replayable as a catch up mechanic. If they can keep daggers from sylv as strong as they did, then this should be fine

[2:00:52] gritbarontv: they don't want you to skip a raid tier, :)
[2:00:56] Ponickz: PoNickZ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:01:06] Mecabeast: coulda been only one ofthe 4 choices
[2:01:08] Strik3r019: how is that even a good thing?
[2:01:13] Galadeon: I still like how they did the hard modes in Ulduar.
[2:01:16] zenkodac: you'll just fil that space with ulduar legendary farm for the healing mace
[2:01:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Race and faction change can get nuts if they are not careful, the PvP people might overload the Benediction server
[2:01:24] Shaeli: the rage over this..... wild
[2:01:27] Milanesa_De_Pollo: rip casuals
[2:01:36] bobbyg24k: They will add it

[2:01:50] AudioJaq: They wont- no reason to
[2:01:52] FerociouzMonk: fuck your dungeon finder KEKW
[2:01:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: they aint running up that hill, they tumbling down it Kappa
[2:01:53] Heebojurbles: Dungeon finder but keep it to each server for sense of community still?
[2:01:56] flebbooo: yeaah... we'll see within a month or 2 into wotlk KEKW
[2:02:04] Timmychanga12: Timmychanga12 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[2:02:04] Timmychanga12: Timmychanga12 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Typh166! 
[2:02:08] ArcaneSyntax: they're gonna die on this hill and they're gonna take wrath classic with it.
[2:02:13] lucid_wow: they'll prob add it when the population dip
[2:02:15] Shaeli: i'm amazed they dont just give all classic players a poll or survey asking if we do or do not want RDF..
[2:02:23] lucid_wow: when the population dip hits i mean
[2:02:27] captain_khyzan: IF they want to decrease the boosting and rmt... LFD would help tremendously
[2:02:28] Lostdogal: probably isn't real in the retail team either, yet to see what it launches like
[2:02:28] zenkodac: at least this way you wont have any morons complaing how lfd ruined wotlk, instead they will be begging for it
[2:02:34] TheItalianStallion321: @Shaeli because they it would be like 90% in favor of it lol
[2:02:34] gritbarontv: why are they going hard on carebear mode
[2:02:37] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee Team 2 sent all the no feeback ppl to classic
[2:02:37] TheItalianStallion321: they know*
[2:02:45] Strik3r019: so a low pop server is gonna suffer again to not finding groups?
[2:02:48] desmo7: there should be dungeon finder without teleport = problem solved
[2:02:51] AudioJaq: @TheItalianStallion321 doubtful
[2:02:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: put a poll on the character screen that every account has to answer about dungeon finder
[2:02:52] ZetYokai: fuck off
[2:02:55] mrsuflakis: its 2005 again
[2:02:56] flebbooo: jesus fucking christ blizz KEKW its 2022
[2:02:58] vic_ave: Lets form a friendship circle
[2:02:58] temp3st98: bro we live in 2022 we dont need friends in wow anymore LUL
[2:03:01] draftbrew: friends forever <3
[2:03:08] TheItalianStallion321: @AudioJaq wrong
[2:03:12] vic_ave: wtb bff
[2:03:13] lucid_wow: if they surveyed the playerbase they would probably get like at least 80% of the population saying either yes add it or dont care, max 20% would be vehemently against it
[2:03:16] reggiepowa: there is no running away from that, lfd or not
[2:03:21] WeldinJoker: TOWELLIEE!
[2:03:21] ArcaneSyntax: there isn't enough people playing classic for leveling dungeons to not be dead in 2 months.
[2:03:23] gritbarontv: nostalgia copium
[2:03:23] zenkodac: thats because there wasn't lfd there, but i 100% agree with you
[2:03:27] Draethar: MONEY
[2:03:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: this isn't everquest
[2:03:32] SSD511_: Yup
[2:03:33] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:03:44] MoonwalkingAngel79: i want df tbh
[2:03:50] AudioJaq: @TheItalianStallion321 Its the right call leaving it out
[2:03:52] FerociouzMonk: having LFR doesnt make the game unsocial
[2:03:57] Orion_Cosplay: I disagree. The removal of dungeon finder is the part I'm most excited for
[2:04:01] lucid_wow: or ppl not playing df or wrath
[2:04:12] Megadisaster24: wasn't it a main complaint from the community that RDF was ruining the game?
[2:04:15] marZau: Low IQ decisions constantly from this company
[2:04:16] rensdeamo: They wanna keep calssic as close to the original game as possible
[2:04:19] UltraKSlaya: I'll wait until lfd
[2:04:20] AudioJaq: @Orion_Cosplay agreed
[2:04:25] reggiepowa: retail basically doesnt have lfd, you dont do anything with lfd
[2:04:28] Jarlan23: wasnt the whole point of people wanting classic was because it was more social and didnt have dungeon fidner
[2:04:32] mikkidev: they couldnt just re-release it...
[2:04:32] Gingerprimer: So fun having the forming of a group take longer than the actual dungeon
[2:04:39] lucid_wow: theres def ppl i know who wont play wrath bc of no LFD, removal of LFD is a pretty big hit to casual players who can only play an hour or 2 a night tops and dont wanna sit in LFG and would rather just queue it up
[2:04:43] SSD511_: I have enough wotlk for me I can’t play it again
[2:04:44] sliproach: Every classic for me been there done that i'll just play live
[2:04:46] mikkidev: body type 1 and 2
[2:04:46] r0b928: Micro transaction for lfd
[2:04:49] AveragePvp: @towelliee who’s ego is at on the wrath team that’s at stake? They need to address it now
[2:04:50] Eggz1004: Eggz1004 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Good morning @Towelliee !
[2:04:50] gritbarontv: let's hold hands and sing, lol
[2:04:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: i would feel more social running a raid 4 times rather then 2 times a week Kappa
[2:04:52] belfastcl: add rfd in the content phase where it was added in the original version, odne
[2:04:57] flebbooo: 100%
[2:04:58] lucid_wow: also removing LFD takes away from the classic experience too, LFD was added in wrath so should be in wrath classic
[2:05:01] captain_khyzan: @rensdeamo how... they just changed raid progression big time in wrath classic... a bigger change then LFD imho
[2:05:06] Orion_Cosplay: @AudioJaq One of the pillars of MMO design is player interaction. Loads of convenience features they've added have made it more and more single player mobile game
[2:05:09] Strik3r019: it sucks because u have to sit in town or a certain zone to find people and if ur in a low pop server u waste hours doing so
[2:05:11] PhantomX_Destiny: Might as well play Retail if they put LFD
[2:05:27] Molvonos: towRage towRage towRage towRage towRage towRage towRage
[2:05:29] Draethar: @towelliee But Towelliee I feel like they have sciences the F out of players for each game to make the maximum amount of money. They want people to play WotLK then move on to Dragonflight.
[2:05:49] reggiepowa: wrath is all about raiding, dungeons are pretty much irrelevant, and you cant queue for raids so with a good premade grouping tool players will be happy
[2:05:50] AudioJaq: @Orion_Cosplay Its crazy how many people miss that- and dont think about what an auto que does to the game EVEN WITH the evidence being there already
[2:05:56] Deadelus0: i don't mind this change at all
[2:05:59] Gingerprimer: I think they should force ppl to use TS or skype for raids since that is the true social interactions
[2:05:59] FerociouzMonk: Spam trade chat that's already being spammed for tanks/dps/healer while try to read the LFG spam to find people..
[2:06:00] TLshoddy: @Towelliee was because bombs still carry ST
[2:06:02] Megadisaster24: They were pretty monster before, this is a buff is anything
[2:06:03] schmooplesthesecond: no surv is dogass in single target
[2:06:11] Gingerprimer: ban discord for wrath raiding aswell /s
[2:06:11] Saylore: i am so tired of blizzard balancing.. Last week bliz devs seversl times said, that dh is great and working as intended, and... you can check ststistic on wowlogs to prove they are wrong
[2:06:12] ArcaneSyntax: they were only good st because of the bombs
[2:06:12] Armdel: isnt it just to make them less dominant in keys?
[2:06:13] zenkodac: i dont think blizz cares enough about classic to go that far, i think they have a vague idea of what classic crybabies are like and did this to avoid something they didnt need to avoid
[2:06:15] Orion_Cosplay: @AudioJaq I remember in actual wrath, queueing for a dungeon, but having no clue where the dungeon was actually located....
[2:06:19] KylerNA: So our hunter basically said they just shifted the damage from one thing to another
[2:06:22] AveragePvp: @schmooplesthesecond if you’re bad
[2:06:22] fluh_: gingi said 4% aoe nerf 2% st buff
[2:06:23] PToastman: Laughs in affliction
[2:06:24] Warblade23: survival nerf is so minor. they will still be top
[2:06:39] schmooplesthesecond: @AveragePvp look at jailer log you stupid
[2:06:40] Molvonos: Now they want destro locks to excel at spreadsheets.
[2:06:41] Febreze1212: yup demo is the play now
[2:06:41] xhaven: shouldnt Destro EXCELL in multi target thpough??
[2:06:44] vic_ave: they still going to be number 1, destro locks
[2:06:56] flebbooo: normal run?
[2:06:57] leaprah: finally the real lock spec can be played
[2:06:58] Xsilentghost: what's the new build today
[2:07:00] TheItalianStallion321: yeah i am confused myself on this 4 hour maintenance today. it is what it is
[2:07:01] reggiepowa: implementing sod I guess
[2:07:05] zenkodac: they are still pumping insane so everyone gona keep playing cus its already their most geared toons
[2:07:08] lucid_wow: destro isnt even gonna be the best warlock spec let alone the best spec after that nerf
[2:07:15] Strik3r019: 190?! u can tank that on a 190?
[2:07:20] jetributions: mythic dungeon week also
[2:07:30] lucid_wow: geared warlock players are just gonna swap demo for the most part
[2:07:32] zenkodac: yea
[2:07:33] Otton_03: SOFOM isn't ?
[2:07:37] Respls: i liked SOD  just didnt like the run back lol
[2:07:44] zenkodac: couple fun bosses in there but overall it was the worst
[2:07:44] borisdic: fun raid shards were crap
[2:07:45] PToastman: One of them needs to be last
[2:07:45] Rexy95: for me it was sepulcher :(
[2:07:56] bigdaddystunna: sanguine is gonna be fucked right up
[2:07:58] TheItalianStallion321: sanguine in Grimrail Depot KEKW cant wa
[2:07:59] TheItalianStallion321: wait
[2:08:03] lucid_wow: @Otton_03 a lot of ppl liked SOFO after it got nerfed a bit, SOD was pretty universally disliked
[2:08:14] magemaster225: healer vacation
[2:08:15] Sollice: !alpha
[2:08:15] Moobot: @Sollice ALPHA PHASE 5 8/9/22 and we are getting the Ohn'ahran Plains and lets start a rumor - Holy Paladin and 100% Monk talents ?!?!?
[2:08:16] wolvepg: all dungeons are better on fortified
