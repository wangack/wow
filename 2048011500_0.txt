[3:05:05] skibbatv: GDKP is a huge incentive for people to return after missing out and giga geared players to keep logging on. It's good for everyone but bad for the game
[3:05:06] Taylor131313: what did you try morgon
[3:05:20] sombr999ero: what is GDKP?
[3:05:28] Taylor131313: @skibbatv why is it good for returning players? if I'm returning player I will have 0 gold most lilkely

[3:06:42] Basilwheat: count to 9 in spanish now? PauseChamp
[3:06:45] Ropy123: @skibbatv it bad for people and game, you forgot how classic era was?
[3:06:51] skibbatv: @skibbatv Yeah, it's good for the boosters and gold buyers but bad for the game. Like I said
[3:07:10] triggerddsf2: are you still playing palworld ?
[3:07:25] Elijahss: The p2w part does not matter, the game can still be pay to win, but the AH prices should be way better without GDKP

[3:42:38] Zuleyus: I would be careful with calling on your viewers and tweeting Blizzard about it, though. it could be seen as brigading, which isn't exactly a well liked behavior either @AnnieFuchsia
[3:42:48] huffy_bird: I am
[3:42:53] raindelay__: are you gonna collect all appearances when you will be able to unlock appearances regardless of armor type?

[3:44:05] Zuleyus: I get why you do it. I'm just advising caution against openly utilizing your followers to act against others in masses, be it justified or not
[3:44:14] bYTEfROG: I love how he advertises the service too "gamel changes when drops end"
[3:45:39] JacoFTW123: which character is your main

[3:49:58] Collnaris: riot let go like 1k people didn't they?
[3:50:10] Bloodmatch: Maybe ghostcrawlers looking for community people for his project anniesHmm
[3:50:19] spiritcaller: Heartbreaking that the Fallout76 CM, Lady Devann, was laid off. She was fantastic. :(
[3:50:22] Taylor131313: do they not realise games without community are nothing?
[3:50:27] JimmyJelqer: lol got her ass
[3:50:36] Collnaris: HUH
[3:50:38] Vossie1990: and iceland! Im sure iceland has big streamers too
[3:50:47] Taylor131313: eeeh
[3:50:57] Aegis_2566: They prioritise money over customers. Sadly it always works out, no matter how much a company scams their customers. Apple is a great example
[3:51:06] Wardrick7: i dont get why community managers get axed so often
[3:51:07] OJ_Hype: i mean the community manager is not the one that makes the community though, its the game itself being good
[3:51:09] Collnaris: intersting new accounts today
[3:51:42] Wardrick7: and then companies are surprised when people are unhappy with the community support they provide
[3:51:56] Aegis_2566: They are not surprised
[3:52:03] Aegis_2566: They just don't give a shit
[3:52:26] Collnaris: civcivv from stream?
[3:52:28] OJ_Hype: but do those things affect the average player?
[3:52:57] A_B_P: cumulative effect
[3:53:17] Collnaris: awc still gets like no advertising
[3:54:06] demonzhunter: gz

[3:54:22] Wardrick7: not enough prize money is a big problem in many esports. its even worse in team esports
[3:54:24] Toiarc: Poggers, mount :O PogChamp
[3:54:46] gnubbii: Well do you remember when they tried that buy selling ingame toys and in the end they thought the price was too big so they took most of the earnings from the toys
[3:54:47] Collnaris: you have to actually know about it and seek awc to catch the streams
[3:54:55] Taylor131313: the toy thing was ridiculous
[3:54:59] Wardrick7: that was really stupid
[3:55:00] Taylor131313: I can't believe they got away with it
[3:55:03] Collnaris: ye that was scuffed af
[3:55:04] demonzhunter: really?
[3:55:07] demonzhunter: that is so bad
[3:55:10] Aegis_2566: The prize money is low compared to other esport games. Sim racing has an absurd amount of money during esport events. F1 2021 had $750k that people competed for @anniefuchsia
[3:55:15] demonzhunter: brilliant business idea
[3:55:33] Basigouloum: even in league prize money are not that high when you consider 5 man team + coach
[3:55:44] firbiirn: Thank u for the Mount Drop <3 <3 <3
[3:55:47] Collnaris: logging diamond?
[3:55:49] Bennyyo: karokta up
[3:55:58] OJ_Hype: @Aegis_2566 probably related to playerbase, wow pvp is extremely new player unfriendly
[3:56:01] tzhhe: peepoHey
[3:56:12] Taylor131313: biggest gaslighting in history
[3:56:14] Taylor131313: peepoGaslight
[3:56:18] Aegis_2566: Wow pvp is generally player unfriendly
[3:56:30] Bennyyo: im horde did custom called karokta
[3:56:57] Taylor131313: MDI prizemoney is even worse
[3:57:04] eielwind: you cant be cross faction
[3:57:17] Taylor131313: basically making just above minimum wage if you win, taking into account all the time invested into it
[3:57:26] Wardrick7: last char for me Prayge
[3:57:29] Bennyyo: MC now
[3:57:39] Taylor131313: I think Naowh estimated it once
[3:57:39] smilingpixels: what are you drinking?
[3:57:41] Aegis_2566: Wow esport prize money is an absolute joke
[3:57:56] Wardrick7: it is bad but also is the viewership so there is no incentive to increase it
[3:57:59] Bennyyo: ppl have started
[3:58:22] Aegis_2566: Company value / prize money ratio has to be the lowest ever for wow esport
[3:58:59] Dragencraft: @Aegis_2566 butt they are very poor company Kappa
[3:59:06] Aegis_2566: True
[3:59:25] Annies_Bot: Stay updated and notified by following Annie on Twitter twitter.com/anniefuchsia anniesHype

[3:59:55] Makkan780: i logged in 2 alts and was next to karokta EZ
[4:00:07] Aegis_2566: In 2017, the prize pool in AWC was $260k. Back then Sim racing wasn't popular and rFactor had a prize pool of $1m
[4:00:31] Collnaris: that was legit scam
[4:00:41] demonzhunter: yeah pr disaster
[4:00:45] Annies_Bot: Get the ultimate Phantom Liberty experience with GeForce - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/cyberpunk-2077/
[4:00:47] OJ_Hype: never even heard about that
[4:00:50] bYTEfROG: it got overshadowed by other... problems they had
[4:00:54] demonzhunter: someone should have known better
[4:00:55] Aegis_2566: Nah they have to fire more people when they want to increase prize money. How else are they gonna financially recover otherwise?
[4:00:59] Bloodmatch: Asmon most likely mentioned it
[4:01:00] gnubbii: Well wasn't giving Fel Drake away for free also a scam towards the people who bought it?
[4:01:09] bYTEfROG: nothing beats the breast-milk thief
[4:01:14] Taylor131313: absolutely not
[4:01:21] Toiarc: Its completelty understandable to collect money for Bobby Kotics new yacht
[4:01:28] Collnaris: i'm pretty sure he did talk about it
[4:01:41] OJ_Hype: xddICANT
[4:01:41] Aegis_2566: The fel drake is not a scam
[4:01:47] Taylor131313: if you want to drop some thousand dollars on pixels ingame it's a you problem xdd
[4:01:54] Aegis_2566: ^
[4:02:15] loppish91: buying something thats years old and then becomes free is not a scam LUL
[4:02:22] heavyharmonies: Fel drake may be a bad deal, but it's not a scam. Scam means not getting what you paid for.
[4:02:23] AlfredK: yea
[4:02:25] Collnaris: ye
[4:02:41] Collnaris: my mount is crabby
[4:02:41] rarid_kek: it would be pretty funny if steam did the same thing with super expensive knifes for csgo KEK
[4:02:52] Aegis_2566: Guys, do I buy myself a new car or a glowing cat in wow?
[4:03:04] heavyharmonies: @Aegis_2566 Glowing cat for sure.
[4:03:09] Wardrick7: works
[4:03:11] Collnaris: it does

[4:07:03] lamerterry: TY ill be back
[4:07:16] rarid_kek: for me it looked stuck but then I already got it in the game, so im guessing its visual bugs sometimes?

[4:09:15] eldurian: you need to invest more points into luck
[4:09:15] Taylor131313: think you need to be at least 160cm to get the mount to drop
[4:09:17] Nrage_24: What shoes?
[4:09:21] Nurutooo: issue is that annie is too short that's why it doesn't drop for annie KEKW

[4:26:15] basedust: i love elden ring and those npcs are actually technically homeless according to the lore i believe. They are basically lost undead lords and servants of the old kingdom.
[4:26:20] kizora94: just wait until theyre fully dead to kill them, ez
[4:26:30] bYTEfROG: better to link to for a command

[4:28:55] Toiarc: I feel that there really isnt many streamers that engage to be active with the viewers ingame and chat...

[4:29:33] firbiirn: Would be so nice if they make smthng that in ice crown u dont need to clear every single boss to get to End Boss..
[4:29:34] Twiztid_C: I'd help but I'm NA and unsubscribed from WoW back in Cata

[4:35:50] Nrage_24: Is that X45 Hart breaker
[4:35:55] Abixa: did they increase the % ?
[4:36:14] Abixa: wow, thats great
[4:36:21] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: mikaa might not be able to play she got ddosed again and struggling to maintain a stable connection
[4:36:31] Nrage_24: We’ve heard your feedback on the frustrations with X-45 Heartbreaker’s low drop rate and feeling the pressure of having to farm the mount by cycling through as many alts as possible every day. From now on, the first Heart-Shaped Box you receive each day across your Battle.net account will have a greatly increased chance to contain the X-45 Heartbreaker mount.
[4:36:41] celeran1: shes gonna brb
[4:36:42] Collnaris: I’m on my phone. my internet just randomly died
[4:36:42] Taylor131313: ddos again? wtf

[4:40:02] Annies_Bot: Mods anniesDinkDonk next ad in 3mins, you can snooze 3 times!
[4:40:04] kizora94: maybe just the fact that he has succes and the DDos-guy is jealous
[4:40:10] hivenzino: a pvp player has a ddos problem because he refused to give gold to a guy who wanted to buy a transmog set
[4:40:15] Collnaris: okay i'm back

[5:38:26] rarid_kek: imagine its in one of your characters mail boxes KEK
[5:38:34] Wardrick7: @Mirkooo you have to enable it yourself in chat channels. should make it that its on by default
[5:38:43] Mirkooo: @Wardrick7 true
[5:38:54] Wardrick7: sanctum is the worst raid in SL
[5:38:55] Miliexy: nathria is the best for me
[5:39:00] Sne4ky79: @drzaius31 i liked the batman games except the last one and marvel on gamecube was good
[5:39:03] duor: only one raid has Barghast, come!
[5:39:07] jimzyz98ttv: i like it cause i got the mount from the nine boss first try :D
[5:39:09] Olive_West: Sanctum is literally the worst one lol
[5:39:10] Aegis_2566: Sanctum was a good raid, but the gems made it really wonky
[5:39:13] BE3njo: @jimzyzbruhtv hell nah, nathria is waaaay abovce both sanctum and sepulcher
[5:39:17] BE3njo: its not even close
[5:39:19] Wardrick7: nathria was the best, then sanctum and then really far behind in sanctum
[5:39:23] Mirkooo: CN was amazing
[5:39:27] Wardrick7: sepuclher*
[5:39:27] Makkan780: sanctum was garbage

[5:40:11] GibsonSWE: CN was my first tier anniesHype
[5:40:18] Wardrick7: i did play actively in sanctum and then my guild quit raiding during it xdd
[5:40:19] Aegis_2566: I got CE Sylvanas and I liked the Bosses, the only thing that made it weird were the gems, besides that the Raid was great
[5:40:24] Taylor131313: sod is the worst of the last 4  expansions
[5:40:25] Basigouloum: how many people played SL xdd
[5:40:32] loppish91: i bet annie loved the among us boss the most
[5:40:38] Mirkooo: I quit in season 3 and came in season 4 for Fated
[5:40:42] PneumaWHU: our sanctum progress was during fated, we didn't during original raid
[5:40:42] jimzyz98ttv: but you can't lie sanctum have some nice transmog Annie
[5:40:44] Wardrick7: though i should be thankful for sanctum, it got me to play sepulcher with this community LUL
[5:40:55] rarid_kek: I only played this one on lfr I think
[5:41:01] Mirkooo: Sanctum Warrior set is bis GIGACHAD
[5:41:02] kizora94: I burnt myself out on FFXIV
[5:41:25] Sne4ky79: you guys did classic raids after ff14 right?
[5:41:26] Aegis_2566: Sanctum Plate is dedicated to Dks
[5:41:30] sunny_lik: is this GDKP ?
[5:41:31] Aegis_2566: It looks nothing like warrior
[5:41:32] DracNaSBLood: left just before shadowlands launched.
[5:41:33] AlfredK: That patch is probably the worst state WoW has ever been in
[5:41:34] drzaius31: Same thats why i haven't done the patch YEP
[5:41:40] Mirkooo: @Aegis_2566 NOIDONTTHINKSO
[5:41:47] kizora94: yeah, used to grind it during the shadowbringers expansion, raided a lot and attempted Ultimate fight
[5:41:49] Mellbaa: sry i just saw, can ijoin the run?
[5:41:57] duor: such a charming community LuL
[5:42:03] politimi_72: @AnnieFuchsia ff14 supposed to be heaven, who send you hate?
[5:42:19] Mellbaa: sanctum mythic?
[5:42:25] radiorahem: you got hate for streaming wow as a wow player ? 😂😭
[5:42:31] Basigouloum: people are passive agressive in ff14
[5:42:37] loppish91: omg why didnt you cry your eyes out Smadge
[5:42:46] kizora94: yeah, if you like all the things they are happy, if not, get the hate
[5:42:48] esqiv88: you should not care about others say Anniefuchsia, haters will be all the time, just enjoy classic/retail, anything. twitch is for entertainment :D
[5:42:54] drzaius31: ff14 also has a lot of ex wow refugees that hate wow passionately which intensifies it
[5:42:55] Shinkiro94: every game has those cringe people though
[5:42:55] GibsonSWE: Cry better! Madge
[5:43:08] BE3njo: weebs are crazy ngl xD
[5:43:08] ViktorNorr: hey

[5:43:29] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: are u full
[5:43:35] Volinra: ty for runs invite :d
[5:43:40] Basigouloum: it's just a minority of wow haters that jumped in all wow streamer that tried ff14 and were very toxic
[5:43:44] duor: their pet baby game was blowing up and they got uber protective
[5:43:46] drzaius31: @politimi_72 not those ones LUL
[5:43:48] duor: very strange LuL
[5:44:14] kizora94: well the entire ffxiv community feared that the known WoW toxicity would come over to FF as well
[5:44:22] duor: suffering from success fr Sassy
[5:44:23] Wardrick7: @drzaius31 true, i think this is a big reason for it
[5:44:28] drzaius31: @kizora94 this was also a thing
[5:44:33] Basigouloum: @kizora94 so they became toxic too, makes sense LULE
[5:44:36] shaneheavymetal95: That kind of fanbase is one of my biggest turnoffs for me trying FF14
[5:44:52] politimi_72: @kizora94 they have the same shit over there, like the addons fiasko like 2 years back, like serious things going on
[5:44:52] Wardrick7: YEP
[5:44:53] kalachaa: @Annies_Bot i havent had any ads at all in the hours ive been here
[5:45:10] duor: @shaneheavymetal95 yeah i enjoy ff14 but sometimes the cringe makes my spine hurt
[5:45:11] Wardrick7: what
[5:45:13] politimi_72: LULE
[5:45:14] MrKanng: OMEGALUL
[5:45:16] GibsonSWE: they call them "wow refugees"
[5:45:16] Basigouloum: wat
[5:45:24] raquelmarcelottv: Wow is grind to win
[5:45:26] Khryschynn: Squid4 <3
[5:45:26] drzaius31: but the retainer system is the same thing KEKW
[5:45:28] Wardrick7: did anyone actually buy that? dont you have phones? xdd
[5:45:28] politimi_72: 3Head
[5:45:29] Cassman_: :HUH:
[5:45:33] Sne4ky79: retainers are weird though
[5:45:42] StatStick: i got my core hound pet from the key fob :)
[5:45:43] Aegis_2566: Annie dont forget your monthly 20 Bucks for more bank space
[5:45:44] jimzyz98ttv: i did not feel at home then i tried final fantasy so i went back to wow :D
[5:45:53] FinkLive: dont people call wow p2w because of existance of wow token?
[5:46:09] Taylor131313: also for a whole 4 slots NOWAYING P2W
[5:46:15] drzaius31: its actually $2 i have it cause im lazy YEP
[5:46:22] politimi_72: imagine be angry at a video game LUL while you can just not play it
[5:46:29] AlfredK: I know people who absolutely "HATE" WoW but they haven't even played it lol
[5:46:34] Makkan780: the most fun was people gettign mad at you when you said the AH UI was shit in FF LULW
[5:46:39] Makkan780: so angry
[5:46:40] Twiztid_C: I still have my physical authenticator from WoW but just use the SMS now
[5:46:42] Basigouloum: @Taylor131313 I really needed that extra 4 slots, 200+ was not enough Kapp
[5:46:45] mathik98: did the drop expire?
[5:46:53] politimi_72: @Makkan780 well it IS shit
[5:46:53] duor: Makkan780 you don't get it, it's a DESIGN CHOICE BabyRage
[5:46:57] Twigbot4k: Annie, more amusing, legit authenticator works maybe 10% of the time on the blizz website, or 0%.,
[5:47:04] Makkan780: yep
[5:47:09] Sne4ky79: @mathik98 yes ended 7 mins ago
[5:47:16] Cassman_: you dont get advantage by paying actual money, therefore it's really not P2W
[5:47:22] mathik98: @Sne4ky79 damn. needed 35 minutes more....
[5:47:22] Wardrick7: compared to modern WoW AH UI FF ui is shit. but its fine if you compare to old wow ui
[5:47:31] Toiarc: They need to make Tuskar race for both factions....
[5:47:32] adparticular1: 😡 I am SO angry
[5:47:35] drzaius31: yep tribalism is fun pepeW
[5:47:38] politimi_72: @AnnieFuchsia Btw my physical authenticator STILL works, and i got when they were first releaed.
[5:47:59] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: can i join for this one annie
[5:48:04] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: or are you full mate
[5:48:06] duor: drzaius31 yeah but ff14 is tribalism + mmo theatre kids, the ultimate combo LuL
[5:48:29] DracNaSBLood: wow tokens are awesome if you choose to use said item.... i intend to use item when i return for lvln proffs.
[5:48:32] drzaius31: @duor Theatre kids KEKW
[5:48:39] Captain_N_The_GameMaster: steebzHi anniesHYPERS steebzCheer Be great today like Zlatan! steebzDance anniesDinkDonk
[5:48:40] Lakatarmen: if they would fix the bot issue farming reagents, it would also solve the need of buying tokens
[5:48:42] kalachaa: @politimi_72 mine ran out of battery xD
[5:48:58] Sne4ky79: anniesHEY @Captain_N_The_GameMaster
[5:49:00] politimi_72: @duor Mad max, Furrys gangs
[5:49:01] Wardrick7: you can put more if you buy more retainers xdd
[5:49:13] drzaius31: @AnnieFuchsia Yeah it could only be increased by the retainer system
[5:49:16] Annies_Bot: Start learning a new language in 3 weeks with Babbel! Use my link https://bit.ly/3SyihGm to get up to 60% OFF a lifetime subscription! anniesHype
[5:49:16] Wardrick7: now you could argue that is p2w LUL
[5:49:24] kizora94: FFXIV UI never bothered me, not perfect but I never thought anything is missing
[5:49:30] AlfredK: I do not understand why FF fans are so defensive. The game has a lot of problems too. At least WoW players say that the game is bad if it is bad.
[5:49:33] Twigbot4k: my phsical auth technically comes on, but never auths with the blizz site today.  It's a relic.
[5:49:47] rarid_kek: I remember in shadowlands there was druid bots everywhere in bastion on the launch day, actually insane
[5:49:51] duor: brb gonna start a reddit hate thread about how annie hates the p2w retainer system notee
[5:50:12] duor: oh god yeah the max speed bike LuL
[5:50:26] kizora94: the whale?
[5:50:31] drzaius31: whale YEP
[5:50:32] Wardrick7: true but that speed increase does not really matter as raids are released a bit later
[5:50:46] kizora94: I think around 30
[5:50:51] kizora94: not sure tbh
[5:51:01] politimi_72: If wow had 8 seater mount it would benefit multiboxers and people would hate more
[5:51:02] drzaius31: yeah its the most pointless speed boost ever LUL
[5:51:16] MrCakemix: i just feel ffxiv is not as competitive as wow in regards to loot and all, making these pay to win features not win much for the player against others
[5:51:16] biglokoo: hi
[5:51:17] Kaiwr: @AlfredK FF fans criticize FF too, like some Wow fans defend wow
[5:51:27] Alastor7783: multiboxers play druids & flightform follow each other
[5:51:29] stefo_is_here: Mounta count as p2w?

[5:51:47] FinkLive: how many passengers does The Hivemind mount cap at? As long as you do the chain with everyone, it doesnt have a cap, right?
[5:52:04] Arthannis: how many kill so far annie did? is it the worse mount unlucky you got?
[5:52:06] rarid_kek: yeah 5 I think
[5:52:09] tankish_wow: !drops
[5:52:10] Nightbot: Get your latest WoW drop in this stream! Read more here: https://shorturl.at/bFOR5
[5:52:13] drzaius31: yeah if people think ff isn't criticised they are unaware that ff has whole subreddits of people complaining LUL
[5:52:25] kalachaa: it was 5, and only with the 4 other ppl who you got it with
[5:53:02] duor: fuckin' bob, man...
[5:53:06] StatStick: YEP couldnt agrree more wow is not pay to win
[5:53:10] Kaiwr: @drzaius31 As a FF "fan", i can say that FF have a lot of pb
[5:53:15] stefo_is_here: FFXIV is great and all but the community can be very cult like.
[5:53:16] Wardrick7: @drzaius31 people were delusional because of the hype and being overshadowed by wow hate, now then you look at it, a lot of criticism is stupid on reddit LUL
[5:53:20] NoName6834: also the bigger ffxiv streamers always complain LUL
[5:53:27] krutogaming: yes wod
[5:53:29] Twigbot4k: hmm, 40 dollar whale mount vs eso notable homes I oft buy for 100 dollars or more.
[5:53:31] Morgonbladet: ConcernFroge
[5:53:42] Taylor131313: OJ? Kapp
[5:53:48] Yers1: I have a friend that did that
[5:53:56] rarid_kek: but like whats the point?
[5:53:58] StatStick: I just dont think even with 200k gold increase you can buy the gear for mythic keys
[5:54:01] Major_Pud: based on how many ads i see for it, it cant be that uncommon
[5:54:04] drzaius31: @Wardrick7 Bingo the whole thing was emotions YEP
[5:54:23] politimi_72: Which game was that you get to buy plots for houses in early access for like 100 euros?
[5:54:27] Sne4ky79: eso shop is ouch at times @Twigbot4k
[5:54:27] ratze78: !drops

[5:54:39] rarid_kek: its at 340k gold atm I think
[5:54:44] drzaius31: @NoName6834 Literally all Xeno does LUL
[5:55:09] krutogaming: :O
[5:55:21] Makkan780: cant have wow players complain about thier game LUL
[5:55:26] duor: literal gaming racism
[5:55:30] drzaius31: it was cause of the hype plus your wow label YEP
[5:55:35] firbiirn: LEL
[5:55:39] Sne4ky79: you should see the eso shop so much for eso ingame coins @AnnieFuchsia
[5:55:45] Twigbot4k: WoW teaches us what makes up a bad game, so yes, we can ID good games from that.  :)
[5:55:47] StatStick: 100 percent some misogyny as well
[5:55:49] Taylor131313: FF defenders were the worst
[5:55:51] Twiztid_C: I kind of don't want to play Lost Ark because I'm a cheapskate when it comes to games
[5:55:58] Twigbot4k: NOT saying WoW is bad.  I enjoy it.
[5:55:58] Unwo_: !drops
[5:55:58] Nightbot: Get your latest WoW drop in this stream! Read more here: https://shorturl.at/bFOR5
[5:56:00] stefo_is_here: Hype died
[5:56:13] Twigbot4k: But I could see people saying that.
[5:56:13] Taylor131313: I'm still mad at the people who essentially made you quit the game, you were loving it so much and I loved to watch you stream it Sadge
[5:56:15] NoName6834: @Sne4ky79 eso monetization is bad
[5:56:22] Sne4ky79: ^
[5:56:23] kizora94: yeah lots of FF players just dont even like it when you only mention WoW or even saw it as an act of treason from me to even give WoW a try again
[5:56:23] rarid_kek: are you close to having all transmogs in the game?
[5:56:24] RavenNerd: and if you tell FF players you aren’t interested in the story they get so mad
[5:56:25] Wardrick7: meanwhile if you streamed wow you could not say it was good or you got harassed LUL
[5:56:28] BoomieWoomie: I just missed the drop by 23 minutes :c
[5:56:33] rarid_kek: !mounts
[5:56:33] Nightbot: Annie's mount collection: https://simplearmory.com/#/eu/ravencrest/anniefuchsia/collectable/mounts
[5:56:49] itsparvati: in the end, gaming is about fun. if you got the money to blow and it makes your gaming more fun, go for it
[5:56:49] Taylor131313: understandable Sadge
[5:56:51] Lakatarmen: its so funny how games that just rides on hype, think they are a good MMO, for 5 mins and then they fall back to wow
[5:57:13] duor: @RavenNerd ff andies when you suggest that perhaps the side quest storyline from a jrpg mmo isn't as compelling as the lord of the rings majj
[5:57:13] drzaius31: you have 5.4 and 5.5 on the vods but not 5.3
[5:57:15] Taylor131313: I remember when you said some days you almost had to force yourself to stream, it was actually super sad to hear
[5:57:16] stefo_is_here: But did you finish EW?
[5:57:31] rarid_kek: did you still not get mimirons jumpjets?
[5:57:49] Wardrick7: a lot of shadowbringers vods are missing Sadge
[5:57:51] ChrisWWood: There is a new prime battle bet to claim for a month starting today. I already have it when it was in the shop
[5:57:54] RavenNerd: @duor true LUL
[5:57:57] drzaius31: @AnnieFuchsia we all know the real reason is caused you murdered vex in that dungeon KEKW
[5:58:01] Taylor131313: probably the time before new expansions is the best time to finish FF
[5:58:08] AlfredK: Those people are just mentally ill
[5:58:09] duor: actually so true OMEGALUL
[5:58:12] Taylor131313: Crungo
[5:58:14] prosto_vlaad_1: Hi You are incredibly beautiful)) I’ve decided to plunge into the Warcraft universe, can you tell me which server to choose? So that it’s not far from you...
[5:58:28] drzaius31: set expectations YEP
[5:58:29] AlfredK: HUH
[5:58:42] Makkan780: that was so stupid
[5:58:44] Taylor131313: if you decide to go back to FF you should set some hard rules and have mods enforce them tbh
[5:58:53] DracNaSBLood: beinng self
[5:58:54] MrCakemix: @Taylor131313 this
[5:58:57] kizora94: Im sorry that your experience got put down so much..
[5:59:15] Baemor: Kinda weird to have expectations on how people react to stuff
[5:59:23] heavyharmonies: Don't fool yourself. Chat is ALWAYS a problem. Kappa
[5:59:25] Taylor131313: trauma xddDespair
[5:59:25] ChumbaWumba6943: I've played some good games but I genuinely have never been moved that far emotionally to cry, some games have some moving moments for sure, I think some people just react differently
[5:59:27] MrCakemix: ptsd LUL
[5:59:31] BoomieWoomie: will this drop ever come back, or have i lost it forever?
[5:59:38] drzaius31: the 5.4 and 5.5 stuff went well YEP
[5:59:40] Wardrick7: its hard for viewers to contain their hype. they always spam something when it is close to big moment
[5:59:44] Shakutar: Is it even possible to enjoy a game if you're not crying? I always bawl my eyes out playing solitaire
[5:59:51] Sne4ky79: The react andies was quite bad @Baemor
[5:59:53] ChrisWWood: I only played FF on the first version on the original Nintendo
[6:00:02] drzaius31: @ChrisWWood Holy Oldge
[6:00:04] duor: i think the closest i ever got to crying in ff14 was when it says "several cutscenes will now play in order" and you have to sit there for 2 hours
[6:00:05] PneumaWHU: 5.3 video is made/edited, even with has timestamps, but was never released publicly
[6:00:13] Taylor131313: duor ICANT true
[6:00:15] furiousgaze: @ChumbaWumba6943 That was true untill i played the first metalgear solid LUL
[6:00:16] hivenzino: I just started the legendary axe and I already hate it, these quests are just horribly boring
[6:00:19] ChumbaWumba6943: @BoomieWoomie the swift windsteed has been a twitch drop/twitch prime reward twice now so i don't see why not
[6:00:22] tayno239: Hi all!
[6:00:23] BoomieWoomie: alrighty. I just missed it by 23 min sadly @AnnieFuchsia
[6:00:24] Wardrick7: YEP the you gonna cry is annoying
[6:00:24] Toiarc: They are adding my only curve mount into trading post :(
[6:00:25] Makkan780: @duor LULW
[6:00:27] pinkpaws_: will you go again? can one join?
[6:00:34] Wardrick7: i loved the story but never cried
[6:00:39] PneumaWHU: we need diamond for save
[6:00:40] drzaius31: your going to emotional respond in this way or else gunn
[6:00:44] ChumbaWumba6943: @ChumbaWumba6943 for me the closest i got was playing original ff7 years ago lol
[6:00:46] GibsonSWE: To have a genuine emotional reaction there has to be an element of surprise
[6:00:54] Taylor131313: I teared up a little in some parts, but crying for a game just isn't in me
[6:00:58] Makkan780: like in BG3
[6:01:03] ChrisWWood: @drzaius31 I am not that old, I turn 47 in March LOL
[6:01:03] BoomieWoomie: @ChumbaWumba6943 ohhh thats good to know! I hope this toy returns then. Thanks
[6:01:10] A_B_P: has to be natural right plexNodders
[6:01:13] Taylor131313: and cyberpunk
[6:01:21] Baemor: I can't believed Annie didn't cry at the end of Dragonflight smh smh
[6:01:23] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: avatar made you ugly cry
[6:01:24] Sne4ky79: bg3 got me emotional not so much ff
[6:01:26] bYTEfROG: avatar got 2 cries, beginning and end
[6:01:26] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: poor lady
[6:01:27] PneumaWHU: we need diamond for save
[6:01:32] DracNaSBLood: brb
[6:01:36] ehrw: coming back in trying to figure out what's going on. It doesn't work when you're expected LUL
[6:01:37] duor: BG3 didn't get me when i played it but watching on stream i shed a single manly tear
[6:01:40] Wardrick7: spoilers D:
[6:01:44] drzaius31: @Sne4ky79 man bg3 really didn't impact me at all
[6:01:55] MrKanng: See you in the major leagues PepeHands
[6:01:58] drzaius31: just not for me i guess
[6:01:59] NoName6834: also off meds now
[6:02:00] wesjer250: its very diff for everyone, bg3 for example had me 0% emotionally hit but other games do
[6:02:04] DracNaSBLood: o/
[6:02:11] DrazRUp: Heyo
[6:02:19] MrCakemix: @drzaius31 loved bg3, but didnt really get emotional about any of it either
[6:02:24] MrCakemix: Story was great though
[6:02:35] celeran1: sorry i may have done that
[6:02:42] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: Annie i apologize lol i meant hi its theo not yo its theo lol
[6:02:45] duor: i think there were a lot of streamers who really played up their reactions to ff14 at the time too which built up the hype train
[6:02:54] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: never ever said yo before lol
[6:03:36] Baemor: Heads up Annie, you're gonna cry in a moment when you don't get the mount
[6:03:40] drzaius31: @MrCakemix Tbf i really didn't really enjoy it at all but i was also really sick at the time so my emotional state wasn't exactly happy LUL
[6:03:50] weisxd: need help with the raid @AnnieFuchsia ?
[6:03:51] radiorahem: idk why but the gaming community wants everyone to have the same reaction to things
[6:03:52] NoName6834: rich react Pepepains
[6:03:53] duor: @Baemor RUINED
[6:04:03] Sne4ky79: yo spoilers D: @Baemor

[6:06:52] Thall136: what is Annie working on?
[6:06:54] weisxd: inv Wacoo please
[6:06:55] Wardrick7: i would get it if he meant you quitting league after playing for years xdd
[6:06:57] duor: say what you want but pinball for windows xp really saved my life
[6:06:58] SkryDOOM: I've never understood how the heck can people argue about a game, and like gatekeeping it sor hard.
[6:06:58] bYTEfROG: admit it Annie, without ff14 you would still be stuck farming mounts in wow
[6:07:00] Blackmambo116: Annie, do you have a full time job?
[6:07:03] Baemor: WoW didn't ruin my life. WoW IS my life
[6:07:09] Sne4ky79: what ever happened to the wow lore guy after ff hype? @AnnieFuchsia
[6:07:14] drzaius31: @AnnieFuchsia As someone who was never really into ff14 to about 2 years ago but was a huge ff fan that shit was the weirdest fucking thing LUL
[6:07:15] GibsonSWE: KEKW
[6:07:15] zurkom: WoW pulled me out of a blazing building it saved my life
[6:07:19] ChrisWWood: Games are just games, it is funny when people get so into a game they think it is real life
[6:07:20] radiorahem: I never get to finish FFxiv but I ended up missing wow while playing it
[6:07:21] zurkom: like spider-man
[6:07:23] furiousgaze: People need to start to touch grass more instead of investing their lives into games
[6:07:24] skibbatv: @Blackmambo116 12 hour streams a day isnt enough. She also needs a full time job
[6:07:26] Wardrick7: pyro?

[6:08:39] BE3njo: Pyromancer is just a angry child inside of a man lmao
[6:08:41] NoName6834: just like zepla KEK
[6:08:49] duor: i remember preach having a really sane take just saying he personally didn't fancy engaging with blizzard at the time and somehow even he got shit for that??
[6:08:55] skibbatv: think you have to be chasing some kind of positive feedback loop
[6:08:59] drzaius31: he started shit talking other streamers like zepla and xeno

[6:09:44] Wavorn: It's the artstyle that doesn't make me stick with FF14. You look at WoW and you have all these interesting races (for the most part) while on FF14 it's just: Human, taller human, big and broad human, human with cat ears, human with bunny ears, semi anthro cat man and potato.
[6:09:45] furiousgaze: @duor the only funny thing about preach is when he kinda was upset not getting invited to alpha testing
