[1:25:30] Malnar1123: Hi is this the maw mounter stream?
[1:25:53] Sneekzx: @lumimyrsky outlaw is supposedly good
[1:25:54] Maximus_Decius: Rare footage of Towelie PvPing SeemsGood
[1:26:23] yunggluten: @Lumimyrsky youre not gonna get blown up in one stun any more but they do good damage and Mage/Rogue comps are still really good at controlling the entirety of a match
[1:26:32] Gnral: legion s1 or shadowlands s1 which one
[1:27:05] swordart_19: shadowlans s1 cause gear works 4Head
[1:27:21] Lumimyrsky: @yunggluten Ah right, cause I remember rogues being literally impossible to beat because of their openers when SL launched LUL
[1:27:58] Maximus_Decius: LUL rogues man , i hate em

[1:29:10] yunggluten: I think sub's a good high mid range spec, but there are way better melee's currently
[1:29:28] A_New_Challenger: I dunno - I kinda think rogues are under powered and could use a buff...do I main a rogue? maybe :)
[1:29:45] Lumimyrsky: 2 shamans in unfair because of all the totems anyways LUL
[1:29:48] yunggluten: I think their cc makes them really good in certain comps
[1:30:06] Maximus_Decius: damn shamans with them totems everywhere LUL
[1:30:17] Gnral: towl do you have personal problem with shamans Kappa
[1:30:22] Lumimyrsky: I literally just rerolled shaman a few days ago haha
[1:30:28] A_New_Challenger: Pally / Druid comps ruin me...like my expectations go down as soon as I see that is what I am queued against :)
[1:30:31] Buttscratchrr: pvp so much more harder then pve.... you can't prepare for what the other player is gonna to do.
[1:30:34] TheCliffyShow: @A_New_Challenger I agree with your statement. I can not confirm or deny I play a rogue.
[1:30:42] MurderofPhoenixes: Towelliee, do you chill your whiskey glasses along with the stones? I recommend it
[1:30:52] yunggluten: outside of that they need another class to set up their kills. Arms, Ret, Enhance, and WW are all stronger than rogues in my opinion
[1:31:04] swordwindgaming: pvp is harder because its rocks papers scissors where the rocks are everywhere
[1:31:15] Lumimyrsky: yeah kind of funny how WW went from bottom tier to #1
[1:31:23] swordwindgaming: I'm basically stuck at 50% win ratio pugging
[1:32:00] yunggluten: i'm leveling a WW just because it's the flavor of the month. that and it looks fun
[1:32:13] Lumimyrsky: Last time I even tried Arena was in Wrath lmfao. I lost so fast and it completely discouraged me
[1:32:31] Grady2385: are you going to start tanking with the pally again @Towelliee
[1:32:48] Maximus_Decius: @yunggluten very fun class to play in any aspect of the game , kinda regret i leveled a warrior
[1:32:50] swordwindgaming: I didn't want to arena at all in SL, but m+ situation is too lousy.
[1:33:10] Lumimyrsky: I like m+ in this expansion tbh
[1:33:30] yunggluten: @Maximus_Decius yeah I'm at like level 40 and really liking it so far
[1:33:43] swordwindgaming: m+ is good if you have raid guildies and friends to run with
[1:34:05] Lumimyrsky: Yeah I don't pug m+ at all. Maybe a dps but never the tank. I need that to be a guildie
[1:34:14] yunggluten: @Lumimyrsky arena is super fast and bursty right now and probably wont change anytime soon. Just know it's really fun but you will be punished hard for mistakes
[1:34:54] Lumimyrsky: @yunggluten Yeah I honestly prefer bg's more than arena. Don't think that's ever gonna change sadly.
