[0:48:34] BilieOSRS: Agree
[0:48:39] Prematurid: Concidering it is still in development alpha, it rather good!
[0:48:49] hollywood__cole: People are saying this looks bad, but it looks pretty damn nice to me
[0:48:50] BilieOSRS: It is promising, hope they keep delivering
[0:49:00] VevoxGaming: Im done with preorder and game hypes ): but i hope it will become a fnished game and be atleast decent
[0:49:01] Florganic: looks nice thats for sure, combat seems lacking for now
[0:49:01] ColdChillXI: Pretty great for an alpha
[0:49:14] ukkihc: how is the game so far?
[0:49:20] dualz6045: It's insane to think the world looks this good and we're still 2-3 years out from finish product
[0:49:27] ThaOriginalGamester: they say the map is 5 times bigger than what's available right now
[0:49:30] ColdChillXI: excited to see the systems work
[0:49:41] byrom88: steven said yesterday to asmond all you can currently see is 20% of the actual world
[0:50:10] coldhandsbeatz: How is it feeling so far?
[0:50:20] Architank: Based on watching people gather, I'm hoping they make base materials like wood and stone more plentiful.
[0:50:26] Broomba: Black widow movie @towelliee good?
[0:50:26] Florganic: those fire/magma effects look nice. Combat spell effects need to get toned down tho
[0:50:41] Prematurid: What people think when they hear "alpha" is localization alpha, which is where they take a fully fleshed eastern game and localize it to the west. This is not that, and i think it took balls to allow people to stream this alpha
[0:50:41] noway137: @Towelliee how you finding the game so far?
[0:50:50] byrom88: yeah i agree with the gathering, all trees should be farmable
[0:51:06] scrrumpet: ask asmon hes got like 9m
[0:51:33] skullhead51x: 20% land or sea included? Because they could just slap an empty ocean in the middle like archeage so players have to protect tradeships and fishing boats
[0:51:34] MargaretKrohn: Awwwwwww you are back @Towelliee ! VirtualHug
[0:51:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[0:52:01] coldhandsbeatz: How does the Node system feel so far? They have always put a lot of emphasys on how important it is
[0:52:04] Florganic: how many 'wow killers' have come and gone
[0:52:09] MargaretKrohn: Puurfect, that is all we are asking for @Towelliee - VirtualHug
[0:52:09] Howl1: yo
[0:52:09] ThaOriginalGamester: mix WoW, ESO, & Archage... too lit
[0:52:10] SexWhen: yo broooooooooooo
[0:52:12] SexWhen: SHES LETS GOOOOOOO
[0:52:20] CorrectedInsomniaGaming: i thought the game would look better tbh, even though its an alpha LUL
[0:52:20] Blah206: The towel has been burned too many times.
[0:52:39] Blah206: Ya a mix of Archage and Lineage
[0:52:41] juannffo: I have no hype, but I wish this game evolves to what the developers want, they are aiming to game history changing stuff
[0:52:56] yildizYUSUF: node system will most likely change in the future because it feels too easy to level up atm.
[0:53:08] MargaretKrohn: Have you spent much time in a node @Towelliee ? Like become a mayor and help build up the buildlings, get a house etc?
[0:53:14] ukkihc: I loved rift
[0:53:15] Architank: @byrom88 All trees and stones stones being farmable would be nice. higher tier trees and mining materials could be more rare or guarded by dangerous mobs
[0:53:36] noway137: @Towelliee Just got my rustfeather mount today :)
[0:53:46] ThaOriginalGamester: gotta wait 5 min on that bread
[0:53:50] Razzin_: Steven was orbiting around Asmon all day, clever free marketing
[0:53:55] SexWhen: how is the combat feels ? mix action and tab targetting they say
[0:53:58] Blah206: Damn I came alone, no bread for me
[0:53:58] Eikus11: I was hyped when I backed this game in 2017 on KS haha
[0:53:59] derudin: is the alpha as good as olive garden bread tho?
[0:54:03] ThaOriginalGamester: Keepo
[0:54:05] Broomba: You are sampling bread butter before the first course meal
[0:54:10] Blessed2541: @derudin LUL
[0:54:11] Florganic: last MMO i got hyped for was GW2, which was pretty good, just not quite there.
[0:54:12] noway137: was not expecting it lol, only 47 kills
[0:54:15] Soulsoap: We're waiting on them to bring out the saltine crackers at this point LUL
[0:54:22] KragnosWoW: no one wants a 223 hunter for normal sylvanas FeelsBadMan
[0:54:25] MargaretKrohn: Have you spent much time in a node @Towelliee ? Like become a mayor and help build up the buildlings, get a house etc?
[0:54:27] ukkihc: Works for meif this is anything like rift but plz no pay to win
[0:54:40] yildizYUSUF: oh dude I love prison Mike
[0:54:41] YardRage: gonna eat some GRUEL
[0:54:46] carneasuh: is the game out now?
[0:54:47] Blah206: @KragnosWoW even after buffs?
[0:54:51] MargaretKrohn: That might make you feel more a part of a node.
[0:54:55] cabalish: how was that scarlet widow ?
[0:54:56] Mr_Hasselhoff: go harry go
[0:55:08] Soulsoap: What was the food like, Prison Mike? Kappa
[0:55:09] Pallananana: fuck yeah, avada kadavra his ass
[0:55:12] scrrumpet: kinda like using wand on classic i guess
[0:55:14] MikeGus: Movemt do...wth...looks so scuffed
[0:55:23] NoWaayMan: actually using your wand?! what is this blasphemy
[0:55:25] KragnosWoW: @Blah206 when do the buffs go into effect

[1:02:23] IPatrickl: Ive watched a couple streams of gathering, and what I saw was gatherable tree's were pretty rare, but the game outside of the starting area is beautiful
[1:02:24] The_AshenOne__: this game has been in development for 5 years alpha 0 was in 2017, hmmm i hope that it's more than this

[1:03:53] DABZ16: yo margret is in the chat!
[1:04:00] Stefan_x64: I hope they stylize the UI like they tried with the quest log. Not digging this clean look on the action bar and health/mana

[1:07:52] JoshStryker: $450???
[1:08:01] WolfieMcgee: im a Braver also

[1:08:01] ThaOriginalGamester: $upporting an idea
[1:08:04] ic3k0ld: except for those that paid $500 to get in the Alpha
[1:08:06] Drostep: Ok it’s kickstarters I got it
[1:08:08] ColdChillXI: playing an alpha is to help testing, not for early access
[1:08:09] Azathul: i paid $250 awhile back, but it gives Alpha 2 access
[1:08:17] MargaretKrohn: Keep the grand one
[1:08:18] Zeucean: hard to beat WoW
[1:08:19] MargaretKrohn: OH NOOOO
[1:08:34] cudlsac: not trying to beat wow
[1:08:37] ZoS0: What do you use the Grand ones on?
[1:08:37] MargaretKrohn: The big essences that does not sell for money - thos can be used for caravans at a node @Towelliee
[1:08:41] ic3k0ld: kind of depends on what the person gave the money for
[1:08:42] Chaotic_Mind: others payed 250 when it was a kickstarter and have also alpha acces
[1:08:44] cudlsac: trying to be its own game
[1:08:48] LegacyofTork: I like how the spell graphics use black/darkness, they remind me of DAoC
[1:08:51] ZoS0: ohh Caravans
[1:09:02] Architank: The wisdom of sage Krohn seems to be falling on deaf ears.
[1:09:11] IPatrickl: I would love to see caravans in this game
[1:09:25] Zeucean: @cuddlsac they should
[1:09:33] Getitonthelow: so this game good?
[1:09:36] Contractual_: I think it's great that there's a dev here in the chat to silence all of the doubters!
[1:09:40] mdwyatt: mdwyatt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[1:09:48] bergbergen: Supporting caravans are gonna be big in AoC as well
[1:09:51] ThaOriginalGamester: Archage was dope at launch... they fucked it up with the P2W + Bots
[1:09:51] ic3k0ld: @Chaotic_Mind they have alpha 2 access, not alpha one "also"
[1:09:52] bergbergen: but player driven
[1:09:59] grumpnamedjosh: if youve played wow since the beginning easily have spent over 2 grand on sub and xpac, so 450 for a lifetime sub is saving a whole lot of money
[1:09:59] Davidjac: the graphics are amazing
[1:10:07] cudlsac: @Zeucean why should they try to beat wow FF14 isnt trying to and theyre doing just fine.
[1:10:23] Eviltuna13: The launch killed AA no land plots and ass holes putting there houses to block area
[1:10:27] Drostep: Yeah I don’t even want to think how much I spent on Wow NotLikeThis LUL
[1:10:44] Habamo: @Eviltuna13 And when people started quitting, teleporting bots claimed all the land
[1:10:53] ic3k0ld: an mmo doesn't need to try to kill wow, wow can do that on it's own
[1:10:54] aWild4: @MargaretKrohn there is no buyback ? is it planned ?
[1:10:57] Sollice: Dev is not here to silence chat lol. That's my job :) I would imagine @MargaretKrohn is here to answer your game questions though
[1:11:00] Norbi33: what you think about the world? it feels empty to me @Towelliee
[1:11:03] WolfieMcgee: game play has been Smooth loving it
[1:11:07] ThaOriginalGamester: lets raid Stormwind Keepo
[1:11:12] strike879: if you didnt spend that money on wow it prob would be taken by taxes
[1:11:14] Eviltuna13: @Siinrod yup
[1:11:19] mett7: yeah boring experience for sure Kappa
[1:11:26] GrindyMcGrindy: @strike879 thats not how taxes work
[1:11:31] xlSardonicuslx: gotta say this looks and mesh their lighting affects way better than Crowfall ...
[1:11:42] ic3k0ld: @strike879 I don't think you understand taxes
[1:11:42] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:11:46] ColdChillXI: LUL
[1:11:47] wreckfest72: Can you check out the Desert node north of you?
[1:11:49] Drostep: LUL LUL LUL
[1:11:49] strike879: ive got to pay savings taxes so for me it does
[1:11:51] Renritar: Hi Margaret 😊
[1:11:54] ColdChillXI: here for loot bruh
[1:11:59] Soulsoap: I hope the glowing effect on Sprint ends up having a toggle button :O
[1:12:04] Habamo: @Eviltuna13 I tried Archeage Unchained, but gold buyers/sellers ruined it, also the promise of no p2w was broken quite fast : p
[1:12:06] Drostep: I remember those Moonguard streams of yesteryear LUL
[1:12:07] Returningg: is alpha one just for this weekend?
[1:12:11] Lansty: they will add s bunch more later on, this is just a testing alpha to see how backend stuffs works basically @norbi33
[1:12:14] aWild4: the unzooming camera effect when sprinting feels annoying
[1:12:15] The_AshenOne__: Pog oh
[1:12:17] mett7: man that auto attack is machine gun
[1:12:29] Drostep: Mages seem op asf
[1:12:36] Returningg: the auto attack reminds me of harry potter lol
[1:12:37] DABZ16: @Norbi33 yeah the content in the alpha was meant to be light theyre testing mechanics
[1:12:41] xlSardonicuslx: mobile casting is really nice
[1:12:42] Davidjac: that teleport ios hawt. looks like nightcrawler in x-men
[1:12:45] Charmanzcer: Compared to WoW, how fluid does the animations and movement feel?
[1:12:47] IRLifeOnEarth: amiloHey
[1:12:49] EllisTheMenace1: lol crowfall poor game haha i launched last week
[1:12:53] cudlsac: that teleport is on point
[1:12:57] Renritar: @returningg no this weekend is just the preview. The alpha 1 is a full month starting July 14th
[1:13:00] belfastcl: balance is gonna be great
[1:13:01] WolfieMcgee: all the classes seem op but its alpha
[1:13:05] ic3k0ld: @Returningg it's not auto, you have to hold the button down or click it each time
[1:13:07] ordeph: theres a date for this game to launch?
[1:13:08] TheItalianStallion321: 64.....wut lol
[1:13:11] northern__soul: 64?
[1:13:17] flebbooo: that sounds like a balancing nightmare LUL
[1:13:17] Drostep: Whoa 64
[1:13:18] Dyslexicshark: the meta will bring that down to like 6 tops jst like archeage
[1:13:18] pauljacquesklein: 64 i heard it right?
[1:13:18] mett7: 64 combinations, its really gonna be like 8 archetypes
[1:13:24] jerseyfive: good luck balancing that
[1:13:25] IPatrickl: im pretty sure its 64 sub classes
[1:13:26] northern__soul: ah
[1:13:30] Soulsoap: I'm very interested in the Soulbow class
[1:13:33] ColdChillXI: dayum
[1:13:35] dergNwolf: are tulnar still missing entirely PrideLaugh
[1:13:42] Toradin: soft lock yes
[1:13:48] Renritar: @ordeph nope. It still has a lot of major features to add. Community estimates are 2 years
[1:13:50] Chaotic_Mind: i only hopes this game will have regional pricing especially for the sub bc like in my country you pay 65% extra taxes over stuff you buy
[1:14:07] ordeph: @Renritar omg 2yrs thats a lot

[1:14:19] sLogOG: patched in 2 minutes KEKW
[1:14:22] EzmoNub: @Towelliee its not really 64 classes to play, its 8 classes you can play
[1:14:23] DABZ16: out of range maybe?
[1:14:31] liviu_81: any xp debt yet on death? Kappa
[1:14:33] Renritar: @chaotic_mind they have stated there will be regional pricing for some countries
[1:14:37] GrindyMcGrindy: @Towelliee you were just aimed the other way and was hitting the one you were tabbed at
[1:14:38] WolfieMcgee: nope
[1:14:40] Dyslexicshark: that sounds like a you problem Kappa
[1:14:41] Architank: 8 classes but 64 possible combinations thanks to the main class/sub class combos
[1:14:41] Poiuykk66: This game looks so promising
[1:14:42] sLogOG: oh yeah I tried to reach them about regional pricing but never got an answer KEKW
[1:14:46] WolfieMcgee: no xp debt
[1:14:47] ic3k0ld: its 5+ years before this release, my guess anyway
[1:14:49] Nutsy: @Chaotic_Mind What country is that?
[1:14:52] xlSardonicuslx: die Towlie lets see that
[1:14:57] IPatrickl: if the number is with parenthesis it means overheal
[1:15:14] DoliTheFabulous: @ic3k0ld i think they said next year they will have a beta
[1:15:18] Renritar: Go to the AoC wiki and just type price harmonization
[1:15:23] xlSardonicuslx: kk
[1:15:31] Drostep: Magic missile asmonGASM
[1:15:38] WolfieMcgee: you still lose some loot
[1:15:45] killswiitch: it looks like a mobile game
[1:15:51] ic3k0ld: @PolayasDoli they have said a lot, but most has been later. Even this alpha was
[1:16:01] Chaotic_Mind: @Dyslexicshark not really bc most of south america has that problem. thats why for example wow , steam and now even twitch has regional pricing , even ubisoft has it
[1:16:19] Renritar: @ic3k0ld idk why you say 5+ years. Are you on the dev team? Most of the community estimates 2-3 years. Their dev team is growing very quickly this year. Their development has been slowed a lot from covid but is speeding up now as they get into their new stuidl
[1:16:20] DoliTheFabulous: @ic3k0ld the only thing that was late i guees is this aplha because they had tyo redo their back end and covid?
[1:16:22] Sousa_71: Is the movement controls like wow
[1:16:31] belfastcl: @Chaotic_Mind they said there will be regional prices, but can only play in regional servers
[1:16:32] WolfieMcgee: i ran into lvl 13+ sunstriders yesterday i was just roaming map
[1:16:34] WizWizard: Jacob gonna slay dem goats, and feed the kids
[1:16:34] killswiitch: Yeah dude.. Not worth it
[1:16:42] Kedemel: I spent a long time in UO and SWG. I’d love a new sandbox MMO.
[1:16:47] ic3k0ld: @PolayasDoli they also never said they would release a BR with the money, but they did
[1:16:51] feherlofia123: @killswiitch whut ???? whst are u smoking
[1:17:01] Dark_Kornax: Do you have a referal code?
[1:17:02] Renritar: @polayasdoli they have not said anything about that. They haven’t made promises about when anything after alpha 1 will come out
[1:17:02] feherlofia123: this is the most solid alpha ive seen
[1:17:03] Returningg: is pvp activated for this alpha? i dont think i have seen any pvp
[1:17:07] ic3k0ld: @Renritar because I'm realistic

[1:17:20] feherlofia123: @returningg sieges
[1:17:22] akaFarva: nothing lives up to the hype period
[1:17:25] apollobaker: does towe like the alpha so far?
[1:17:26] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee Do you have a referral code for Ashes?
[1:17:26] WolfieMcgee: they disabled pvp for now
[1:17:27] IPatrickl: @ic3k0ld the br was to test pvp mechanics for free, because br's are easy to make
[1:17:27] xlSardonicuslx: UO was magic times
[1:17:29] akia03: @Towelliee is this on max graphics?
[1:17:30] Kisswani: @Towelliee what time are you joining Mr. Happy today ?
[1:17:32] Azathul: i never play my intended main class in the alpha/betas
[1:17:41] Soulsoap: !ashes @Dark_Kornax
[1:17:48] ic3k0ld: @PolayasDoli if you help fund it yes, it's like a board in a way

[1:18:21] WolfieMcgee: nope
[1:18:40] exod44: @Towelliee With your experience. when do you think they'll finish it? 3 years?
[1:18:45] xlSardonicuslx: dmn mage is wrecking mobs!
[1:18:47] Naxrrhid: @Towelliee are you able to change keybinds in this build?
[1:18:48] Renritar: No that’s not allowed. Don’t even say you have that video because that wasn’t allowed either @towelliee
[1:18:51] buutfuuk: i really want to see the rogue primary mage secondary class
[1:18:52] sLogOG: The monsters around the world and their animations are really good as far as I noticed
[1:18:58] Norbi33: But this much wait for a game thet looks like a mobile version?
[1:18:58] WolfieMcgee: you can wath ashes old vids for that
[1:19:00] akia03: @Towelliee is this on max graphics?
[1:19:03] WolfieMcgee: watch
[1:19:22] xlSardonicuslx: mana consumption is good too
[1:19:29] KragnosWoW: mmos hate warriors when it comes to leveling
[1:19:29] ordeph: LUL
[1:19:34] xlSardonicuslx: not drinking after every mob
[1:19:37] sLogOG: mage is op, who would of thought huh? Kappa
[1:19:47] feherlofia123: so theres no auto attack in this game ?
[1:20:03] Kisswani: @Towelliee what time are you joining Mr. Happy today ?
[1:20:04] akia03: can you show the lowest setting for us potato users?
[1:20:05] sLogOG: There is, his Q on the bar is auto attack feherlofia123
[1:20:05] cudlsac: herbs
[1:20:07] WolfieMcgee: correct no auto

[1:20:09] rreaks: for a TECH alpha, this game is looking very promising. little shit can be fixed. as long as there is a core, there's an actual game there behind the bugs, then were in business. which there definitely is.
[1:20:13] KingBakeneko: @towelliee what main classes are available in the alpha
[1:20:23] kayly_1340: how much do you think this game will b when it releases
[1:20:31] Chaotic_Mind: @belfastcl well that would already be a big plus for me and many others
[1:20:35] Naxrrhid: @Towelliee can you remap the auto attack from Q to another key?
[1:20:39] Renritar: You weren’t allowed to record anything before the NDA dropped yesterday so don’t advertise that @towelliee
[1:20:43] feherlofia123: @kayly_1340 theres no box fee

[1:20:55] PrimalRain: yeah 3-4 years I'd say still
[1:20:56] Renritar: @kayly_1340 $15/month no box cost. They have stated this
[1:20:58] WolfieMcgee: game will be sub only prob $15 monthly
[1:20:58] KingBakeneko: @kayly_1340 it's only monthly pay no base price
[1:20:59] ic3k0ld: I'll give money to something like this, but I want a return on my investment in money
[1:21:04] sifer007: LUL
[1:21:05] xlSardonicuslx: no running back to town for training, Nice!
[1:21:06] rreaks: oh yeah it wont at all, this is early early. people see this and think beta. companies literally do not EVER let players see the game this early. im so pumped
[1:21:14] seo1978: siphon mana instead of life
[1:21:18] grumpnamedjosh: is there still a skill point issue where you can remove the lower tier skills and it still lets you use the upper tier skills?
[1:21:19] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee Drain Mana spell for the warlocks :)
[1:21:35] rreaks: they spent so long developing their backend systems
[1:21:47] northern__soul: Next year release?
[1:21:47] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:21:48] rreaks: it will pay off in the end
[1:21:49] magorbob666: Sick
[1:21:53] xlSardonicuslx: kool
[1:21:53] Renritar: @kingbakeneko mage, cleric and tank are currently available out of the 8 classes
[1:22:04] akia03: aoe farming like a true mage
[1:22:08] rreaks: @sarah_1111 absolutely not, you're looking at 2-3 years
[1:22:08] Renritar: @sarah_1111 very very unlikely. Next year Alpha 2 is probable
[1:22:09] blobdylan_: did people really have to pay $500 to play this alpha?
[1:22:21] Architank: now you've unlocked are grinding
[1:22:23] northern__soul: ok tks for info guys
[1:22:23] KingBakeneko: @renritar ok ty
[1:22:26] Eviltuna13: i guessubf the blue numbers over your hear is mana gains
[1:22:28] Architank: aoe*
[1:22:29] Renritar: @kylorrr_ yes. But over 15,000 people were willing to
[1:22:48] ic3k0ld: @kylorrr_ yes, but they will tell you how they are backing the game and getting this as a bonus and such
[1:22:53] flebbooo: Just hire 4Head
[1:22:59] realyankee: !origin
[1:23:08] skullhead51x: @kylorrr_ they paid $500 to crowdfund the game before it even existed so they get to play the alpha
[1:23:08] rreaks: LULW tyrue
[1:23:11] rreaks: true*
[1:23:13] Renritar: They just moved into a new studio that can fit 300 people. They’re currently around 100
[1:23:16] DoliTheFabulous: they hav 100 people on staff and plan to have 160 when they fully move into their offices
[1:23:18] xlSardonicuslx: at least its not vapor ware, like most games this past few years
[1:23:26] AlcheLUL: its unreal engine tho, many devs should be used to it
[1:23:32] ThaOriginalGamester: they forget, people have to be trained
[1:23:35] RerouteToHell: Legion was when the work that those new hires done was seen
[1:23:39] noway137: great raids tho
[1:23:47] northern__soul: well the game is looking good so far
[1:23:47] ThaOriginalGamester: every project is different
[1:24:01] Chaotic_Mind: it also depends how much money they have and can keep investing , if money runs out to fast they could decide to release it to early what would be a shame
[1:24:12] realyankee: !store
[1:24:12] Moobot: @realyankee towRF TBC CLASSIC Limited Edition TOWELLIEE shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towRF
[1:24:19] grumpnamedjosh: they are currently hiring over 20 different positions on their website
[1:24:23] TheKlein: I like how the game looks
[1:24:25] blobdylan_: atleast theyre getting the funding to hopefully supply a good game in the end, you wont catch me spending $500 right now but definitely launch price
[1:24:37] rreaks: no they aren't
[1:24:42] rreaks: steven is billionaire rich
[1:24:50] noway137: it's his own money right?
[1:24:50] Renritar: @chaotic_mind I don’t think they’re going to have a money problem. Thousands and thousands of people have been buying the packs and cosmetics
[1:24:52] RerouteToHell: Like Star Citizen Kappa ?
[1:24:54] RerouteToHell: KEKW
[1:24:57] ThaOriginalGamester: this ain't your grandparent's WoW Keepo
[1:25:08] xlSardonicuslx: its like night and day this compared to Crowfall blowing my mind!
[1:25:10] ic3k0ld: @Chaotic_Mind the money should not run out because Steve said he could have backed it by himself, just doing this to see interest. His words
[1:25:14] Funktast1c: Hey there chat, how has Towliee been liking this game?
[1:25:14] Tausgi: LUL
[1:25:23] sLogOG: The owner of the game literally says that he doesen't need us to spend any money for the game
[1:25:23] Kedemel: The problem will be scope creep. That’s what I would be worried about.
[1:25:37] PrimalRain: that usually comes later in the process
[1:25:50] Renritar: Yeah they have said that’s their last focus since they just want the game to be stable first
[1:25:51] WolfieMcgee: i love this quest further in
[1:25:57] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @ashesofcreationism
[1:25:57] Gnudel: looks suprisingly good for an alpha
[1:25:59] Kedemel: I hope the project is being managed with a defined “end” for launch.
[1:26:10] rreaks: people really skipped over the title of Tech Alpha and what that means LULW
[1:26:10] exod44: I think the story is a major thing everyone talks about a 'wow killer' underestimates massively. WoW has an amazing legacy lore-wise
[1:26:12] Kisswani: full fledged CGI or gtfo Kappa
[1:26:17] SchnitzL4u: like like like like
[1:26:18] Renritar: I’m hoping theirs a cinematic for node leveling
[1:26:19] Contractual_: hey @Towelliee can u please jump i want to see the animation
[1:26:20] noway137: WHAT 64
[1:26:22] IPatrickl: I think its 8 classes, with 8 sub classes
[1:26:25] hazygreys: 64!!?!
[1:26:27] realyankee: @Towelliee how can i play AOC?
[1:26:30] Xilandir: are animations that a further away framerate capped? It kinda looks like that
[1:26:34] ThaOriginalGamester: 64 specs
[1:26:40] Razzin_: @noway137 8 types which combine into 64 classes
[1:26:43] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: $500 = 11 months of subscription fees ($165), $150 in Embers(in-game currency) and about $100 in cosmetics. That's $415. You're spending about $85 for the actual alpha access.
[1:26:43] ic3k0ld: @exod444 wow is the only wow killer
[1:26:43] Chaotic_Mind: @ic3k0ld yeah also he is not spending it like crazy like SC is/was doing
[1:26:46] rreaks: @realyankee go to intrepids website and buy a package for $500.
[1:26:53] Azathul: 64 combinations
[1:26:54] Renritar: Their are 8 primary archetypes and then once you hit lvl 25 you can pick a secondary archetype of the 8 primary ones
[1:27:13] noway137: i havent watched asmon's perspective, did he enjoy it?
[1:27:17] Elder_Direwolf: That's what she said
[1:27:21] DoliTheFabulous: @noway137 yup
[1:27:25] MaccPlayss: @realyankee do you get all lifetime dlc for free or something for that price?
[1:27:25] Kisswani: I dont think Dan returned to streaming after his mother's funeral i think
[1:27:26] Azathul: but we all know there will be handful of OP combinations that everyone will use
[1:27:30] rreaks: @realyankee its not worth it though, they said it's not worth it, they keep saying it. its really early on, and that is only meant for people who want to support the game. its not meant for casual players to spend $400 on
[1:27:30] TheKlein: Balancing 64 classes monkaS
[1:27:30] Renritar: @warcrimesvonbuttstuff dont forget about the other keys you get too
[1:27:36] Returningg: asmon had a 50+ raid kill a dragon
[1:27:37] mrniceguy817: @towelliee Have you checked dans Twitter this week?
[1:27:37] Mulzaro: Can you change between subclasses?
[1:27:44] AlcheLUL: I think the biggest red flag is that the Bard guy left the dev team, everything else looks good tbh
[1:27:45] realyankee: @MaccPlayss no
[1:27:52] Razzin_: Steven was orbiting around Asmon all day, clever free marketing
[1:27:56] MaccPlayss: @realyankee thats crazy
[1:28:00] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @Slaanesh74 there are no factions that arent player made
[1:28:07] LegacyofTork: I think the players can make their own versions of good and evil
[1:28:08] ColdChillXI: asmon is streaming it on days off nuff said LUL
[1:28:19] Stefan_x64: @Renritar so is there a difference between picking mage first and warrior second? If not, there's only 28 permutations LUL
[1:28:20] WolfieMcgee: i was checking all the web wrapped bodies at first
[1:28:22] Renritar: @razzin_ makes sense though. If anything goes wrong Steven and a couple devs are there to address the issue
[1:28:24] realyankee: @MaccPlayss 500$ is vaery too much wtf that price
[1:28:28] ic3k0ld: yeah, Asmon seemed to enjoy it was doing all kinds of things and the main dev was following him around and helping with things
[1:28:34] noway137: what about sargeant LAUNDRY lol
[1:28:51] Renritar: @stefan_x64 very much so. The primary is much more important. The secondary only augments your abolities
[1:28:52] realyankee: why 500$!!!!?
[1:28:53] DABZ16: bit off more than you could chew there lol
[1:29:04] DoliTheFabulous: @Renritar there is the first class is you main and thew second augments the first
[1:29:05] xhaven: @CrakkaJac they can keep 'saying' what they want actions speak louder than words if they really wanted to the cash shop would be closed and the 500 buy in can be stopped as well
[1:29:06] northern__soul: asmon did a raid so funny
[1:29:21] ic3k0ld: yeah, someone gave him a shit ton of money too, in game
[1:29:24] Renritar: @realyankee it isn’t a game, it is a testing phase. The $500 is to support the development and not play a game
[1:29:25] sirledros: Caves in this game remind me of Ark
[1:29:34] Kedemel: Because you’re not paying $500 to play the alpha.
[1:29:46] ColdChillXI: @realyankee 500 to support not to simply play, alpha means systems
[1:29:48] DABZ16: bet margaret would love to help you
[1:29:50] northern__soul: $500 is to support the game
[1:29:59] realyankee: @Renritar oh!
[1:30:01] realyankee: tnx
[1:30:02] Rudric_Ice: @ic3k0ld ye Steven gave him that gold
[1:30:03] nwtruckin: I heard the leveling in this game is going to be wild
[1:30:04] Belirs: what graphics setting is this on ? :)
[1:30:08] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: $500 = 11 months of subscription fees ($165), $150 in Embers(in-game currency) and about $100 in cosmetics. That's $415. You're spending about $85 for the actual alpha and beta access.
[1:30:16] grumpnamedjosh: yeah but mages can easily kill a lvl 13 for 800XP
[1:30:24] Bgreazyg: is it going to have a monthly sub?
[1:30:29] ic3k0ld: again the 500$ that people give are for what they give it for, if they give it for the Alpha then they paid for the Alpha
[1:30:32] xhaven: @Renritar no Ashes has already been fully funded a long while ago. The money is just what typical companies want more money for them.
[1:30:41] realyankee: game when release?
[1:30:41] LegacyofTork: old school EQ made leveling feel meaningful - I hated that leveling grind but I felt so good to finally ding 50
[1:30:47] hestar: Hey Towellie, it's still Alpha, but how do you see this game's future? Does it have potential?
[1:30:51] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @Bgreazyg yes,. $15 per month
[1:30:58] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: no box cost
[1:31:02] Gutterm0uth: What's max level?
[1:31:08] aWild4: yeah they need to divide the time by 2
[1:31:12] kumah_1: that might be a bit too hardcore for the average person if they want money
[1:31:14] ColdChillXI: mmo genre getting some nice additions
[1:31:15] akia03: so either lots of bots boosters or acount sellers
[1:31:20] LegacyofTork: oh yeah, I agree with you
[1:31:22] nwtruckin: true
[1:31:24] truffsekka: As long as it's fun.
[1:31:30] Kensen2105: trying to remember what it was for vanilla wow
[1:31:31] aWild4: 20ish days to max level is fine
[1:31:38] Hexionas: makes rerolling a char so tedious
[1:31:38] kumah_1: wildstar
[1:31:38] Eviltuna13: LFM Throne room rooHi
[1:31:38] Jollywhompus: if people wanted 250 hours of leveling, classic wouldnt have died as fast as it did last year
[1:31:55] IPatrickl: @kumah_1 I dont think they are looking for the average person to join the alpha test, there are already so many people with a 500$ package
[1:31:55] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:31:56] eaglerydr: Leveling should be meaningful not painful
[1:31:57] SamDavidsin: you under estimate no lifers
[1:31:59] LandSharkX: even if they spread content like mid level raids?
[1:32:05] xaeblue: Yeah man you need strong incentive to do anything "extra"
[1:32:06] Gizimoo86: crowfall leveling really fast like 4-5 hours
[1:32:13] LegacyofTork: Wildstar made that mistake as well - it was a wonderful hardcore game. And that hardcore aspect killed it
[1:32:13] Moobot: 9.1 WoW official Patch Notes | https://www.wowhead.com/news/official-patch-9-1-chains-of-domination-patch-notes-323035
[1:32:15] ColdChillXI: If you like lvling that much just make multiple toons LUL
[1:32:19] luckfore: 3000 no lifers LUL
[1:32:20] ic3k0ld: you can't cater to everyone really, there will always be things lacking
[1:32:21] Renritar: @xhaven yes, but they can’t let everyone into the alpha. Having a million testers won’t help intrepid. All their time would go into the wrong places and they’d have way too much data to go through and game development would take longer…
[1:32:23] kumah_1: @IPATRICKl yeah I mean if they keep it for live
[1:32:25] TeaRexTV: I think 200-300 hours is good
[1:32:27] mohbrkat: will there be more stuff added in the official Alpha test later ?
[1:32:32] xaeblue: I'm a no lifer as well, but that doesn't mean you'll want to do extra shit unless it's valuable in one way or another
[1:32:36] truffsekka: Bugs killed wildstar.
[1:32:40] DABZ16: @Gutter max lvl for alpha is 15 the full game will be 50
[1:32:49] IPatrickl: @kumah_1 ?? the 500$ package includes 11months of subscription
[1:32:56] Mulzaro: Trying to please everyone can also be a huge pitfall. It can lead to a game that does nothing well
[1:33:05] IPatrickl: @kumah_1 so we know its a subscribe game like wow
[1:33:07] amasis: i want to play ashens, but i just dont have the patience for a 2 to 4 month grind to get to max lvl when i can just play WOW and FF14
[1:33:08] oskcheese: Thats why wow went casual
[1:33:10] grumpnamedjosh: the longer it takes to get to max level the more people will be turned off by the feeling of falling behind
[1:33:11] Pigdogx36: The mmo leveling experience has been done for 20’years now. I think people want to level fast, slow leveling doesn’t add anything IMO
[1:33:13] ic3k0ld: that's why I'm enjoying FF14 now, it respects your time
[1:33:16] Aervyper: @Towelliee the biggest problem with MMO's is that in todays world there is a massive disparity between hard cores and casuals.
[1:33:19] Gizimoo86: people want fast easy shit or p2w
[1:33:21] Architank: As long as leveling provides meaningful rewards it will be fine. nowadays leveling in most games is just a grind to get to all the rewards
[1:33:21] Renritar: @gutterm0uth in this test 15, in final game 50
[1:33:22] xlSardonicuslx: I disagree games cater to everyone usually ends up watered down trash, Wildstar was Trash ...
[1:33:24] kumah_1: @IPATRICKl if they keep the hours for the actual release, not alpha
[1:33:32] LegacyofTork: the voice acting in Wildstar was crazy good though haha
[1:33:42] DoliTheFabulous: @kumah_1 they do
[1:33:50] eaglerydr: IMO The no lifers are not the monetary foundation of a mmo the casual players are
[1:34:01] Renritar: @amasis the point of ashes isn’t to get to max level. Their is great content all along the way.
[1:34:01] xhaven: @Renritar hey its your money spend how you want but dont be fooled by a company's pr. There are more than a dozen ways to have a select smaller community be invited to alha test its been done many times before.
[1:34:11] IPatrickl: @kumah_1 the game doesnt require subscription right now, it requires a key, it would make no sense for it to work now lol
[1:34:18] reap_sasin: !ashes
[1:34:28] mmrghost7: is this game gonna be sub based ?
[1:34:33] Stoffy1: I wanted wildstar to last so bad. The world was cool
[1:34:35] Freddy_Krueger: I do miss Rift a bit
[1:34:44] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @xhaven I guess youre just not listening cuz youre missing the major points but that's okay. youve just got it wrong
[1:35:00] xaeblue: If they make an incentive and continue to provide good rewards for these "extra activities" people would love to keep doing it
[1:35:16] Recknry: @minaeki it will fizzle out, that is the viewpoint you’re getting because of this alpha testing
[1:35:18] Folkja: Is this 2005 with updated graphics? Movement looks a bit like that.
[1:35:23] xhaven: @WarcrimesVonButtStuff what? You havent said anything to me?
[1:35:28] AlcheLUL: its not a streamer game at all imo bc people can pvp toggle and grief in enddgame
[1:35:45] Forteskir: This game is nice
[1:35:47] Allvarez: im getting gw2 vibes
[1:35:47] Artenuous: streamers have way more influence than people realize lul
[1:35:57] Jollywhompus: When is WoW going to launch out of beta?
[1:35:57] ic3k0ld: @xhaven some just can't see past what they are told by who they want to listen to
[1:36:14] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: no but others have and ive seen your viewpoint repeated ad nauseum the past 24 hours. im over it
[1:36:18] kumah_1: @IPATRICKl think we're on different topics lol
[1:36:21] Renritar: @xhaven but if you can get 15,000 people to pay for it, why give it away for free? You’re being unrealistic. No one in the world would give something away for free that people are willing to buy at that scale unless it’s charity. And it isn’t $500 just for the alpha. As others have said, you get a lot more. It also helps recruit better talent to say we have this many people that will be playing our game
[1:36:23] xaeblue: That blink is kinda ridiculous lol
[1:36:24] xlSardonicuslx: gotta say so far this game gives feeling of openess and big exploration I like it
[1:36:32] Architank: it's beginning to feel like this discussion about the alpha "price" is nothing more than concern trolling
[1:36:34] luckfore: the movement animation seems a bit weird no?
[1:36:41] tenkeboksen2k: most of asmon viewers are far from wow player
[1:36:45] oreo_mintx: Its so crazy to see asmongold pop off like that last week
[1:36:51] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @Vanguard771 not just that, you get a lot for that $500
[1:36:55] belfastcl: looks like power guilds and zergs will influence the game (maybe streamer guilds too) @Artenuous
[1:36:57] GT_JamesATL: I like to watch but don't play WOW
[1:37:00] xaeblue: @luckfore They haven't fully implemented movement mechanics and collision, etc
[1:37:02] Asthea: just to clarify, people that bought the 500$ or higher pack during kickstarter got a lifetime subscription and many other kickstarter exclusives
[1:37:06] rreaks: like 5% of asmon's viewers currently play WoW according to chat Poll's, possibly even less then that overall.
[1:37:08] xlSardonicuslx: Asmond gold is his persona
[1:37:08] UltimaGG: Watching everyone play makes me wanna spend $500 to try it myself. Its great marketing.
[1:37:14] sLogOG: You can make a "support a creator" thing like epic store, the players put your nickname when they buy the game or what ever so they can get the stats

[1:37:21] BostonEOD: I watch you play WOW and don’t play and I watch LUPO play TARKOV and don’t play
[1:37:29] Renritar: @xhaven I gotta go though. I didn’t buy into the A1 because I don’t see the need. I am excited about the game in later phases of testing once corruption nodes and sieges are implanted fully
[1:37:30] luckfore: @sadler140 ah ok
[1:37:34] Architank: I quit wow near the beginning of this year.
[1:37:36] Spanksalot_4DWIN: i watch quin, cause he's quin, hate half the games he plays
[1:37:38] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @UltimaGG $500 = 11 months of subscription fees ($165), $150 in Embers(in-game currency) and about $100 in cosmetics. That's $415. You're spending about $85 for the actual alpha access.
[1:37:42] Hexionas: the sideways walk looks so weird
[1:37:51] xaeblue: FOMO is a bitch lol
[1:37:58] xlSardonicuslx: quin is a shit show but its fun to watch
[1:38:02] ic3k0ld: yeah, this doesn't seem casual or solo-friendly and I don't think they are going for that

[1:38:04] Charmanzcer: no game is worth $500
[1:38:06] exod44: It's a ridiculous price for any game period
[1:38:10] Charmanzcer: especially in alpha
[1:38:18] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: can you guys read?
[1:38:19] benzona4: a nice 500$ tax write off
[1:38:22] xaeblue: ^
[1:38:25] Artenuous: @Towelliee I meant the word of mouth that streamers help on the free marketing side of things. person x watches streamer y, recommends game to person z bc a personality likes it, etc.
[1:38:27] strike879: be a streamer then you can write it of as a business expence
[1:38:36] TheKeninblack: @WarcrimesVonButtStuff you're spending about $500 for access, don't try to downplay it
[1:38:40] magorbob666: Im selling my WoW acc so I can buy AOE
[1:38:43] IReso: I'm worried that 64 classes is gonna be too much to balance
[1:38:45] Renritar: It’s because they don’t want more testers lol
[1:38:48] ThaOriginalGamester: I want a refund BabyRage
[1:38:52] rreaks: they dont want people to buy it either lmao they keep telling everyone it isnt worth it, dont buy it
[1:38:59] Aervyper: @exod444 it's only ridiculous if you can't afford it
[1:38:59] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @TheKeninblack nice failure of reading comprehension
[1:39:08] Renritar: They had enough A1 testers from the KS lol
[1:39:09] ColdChillXI: its so they only get serious people
[1:39:09] Dewulfi: people who have invested lots of money to play the game will most likely give most the feedback too
[1:39:13] Asthea: @thisisreso it's 8 x 8 classes, they augment each other
[1:39:13] ic3k0ld: If you paid $500 to be in the Alpha you paid for the Alpha
[1:39:16] TheKeninblack: Thanks buddy, nice shilling.
[1:39:20] ElPolloBatman: they'll also limit the amount of people who are aiming at easy entertainment and that "wow killer" factor, because they're probably trying to avoid that. as for testing, hire more people for your qa team?
[1:39:26] Hagazissa: With how steven explained it, there will only be 8 classes, with more like specs to each class, where the bases are similar
[1:39:27] exod44: @Aervyper It's ridiculous if the majority can't afford it
[1:39:29] Gizimoo86: also high price keeps most of the players out of the game so they dont burn out before actual release
[1:39:38] mett7: i bet its 500$ to lower ammount of people that will to test game, they dont need huge amount of people on this stage
[1:39:40] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @TheKeninblack not shilling shit, concern troll, i havent spent a penny on this
[1:39:43] Artenuous: @belfastcl yea i can see that being an issue on some servers. just like any game, there's always other stuff going on in other areas of the game
[1:39:43] DABZ16: if you want to help make the game better with your insight then you buy the alpha dont buy it to play the game
[1:39:52] Tausgi: dont buy this Kappa
[1:39:52] MrGattz: @mett7 bingo.
[1:39:53] Simlish: im still pretty hype i cant wait to see what happens in 1+ years
[1:39:56] Scarhearth: Alot of people that paid for the 500$ alpha are bitching about the littlest of things when its a ALPHA not a full product
[1:39:58] MargaretKrohn: Yeah, please do NOT buy into the Alpha if you do not want to. It's more for folks who want to support he development and join the journey.
[1:39:59] Aervyper: @exod444 they don't want the majority they want people that will pay and help in alpha
[1:40:02] ColdChillXI: They dont need peopl that cant afford it for alpha that time will be closer for beta
[1:40:04] exod44: Go buy a PS5 for your $500
[1:40:11] nightxcl0ud: i tried ff14 but i didnt enjoy the mechanics as much this game looks like the mechanics are good
[1:40:14] GoblinZed: I think your underestimating how many no lifers their actually are, when you cater to the casuals the game dies. I think escape from tarkov is a good example of a game that doesn’t cater to casuals vs a game like fortnite that literally ruined their game for casuals
[1:40:16] Renritar: @margaretkrohn *wave*
[1:40:22] mrblond5: what is kickstarter
[1:40:22] exod44: @Aervyper Yea, I agree with how they are doing things
[1:40:23] MaccPlayss: "only"
[1:40:25] MargaretKrohn: @Renritar magHi
[1:40:27] DoliTheFabulous: nagh
[1:40:27] Mr_Hasselhoff: I hope so
[1:40:27] Holysal: not anymore
[1:40:28] Simlish: no only 3 months
[1:40:29] IReso: 11 months
[1:40:30] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @Towelliee $500 = 11 months of subscription fees ($165), $150 in Embers(in-game currency) and about $100 in cosmetics. That's $415. You're spending about $85 for the actual alpha access.
[1:40:30] TheRedBuccaneer: Only 11 months
[1:40:31] rreaks: yeah, you shouldn't. they're telling people, ONLY but it if you want to support the game and the progression. it is not worth it to pay that just to play the game.
[1:40:31] Gizimoo86: 1 year sub?
[1:40:31] Syllable_: no
[1:40:32] Mick_: no
[1:40:32] KulTheSavage: no 12onths
[1:40:32] UltimaGG: You got lifetime sub?
[1:40:32] MrGattz: the entire point of the 500 is to weed out the average moron that doesnt understand what an alpha is.
[1:40:36] rreaks: 1 yea
[1:40:37] brandon_tapartos: 11
[1:40:37] Azathul: i think that was only during the kickstarter
[1:40:37] Sinamun1: they dont have monthly sub?
[1:40:38] TheKeninblack: @WarcrimesVonButtStuff yet here you are trying to justify a $500 alpha access lol. It's $500 for the access, you just get stuff included with it.
[1:40:40] strike879: any news what the sub would be to start with
[1:40:41] Asthea: lifetime sub was only for kickstarter packs @Towelliee
[1:40:43] Renritar: @towelliee no that was KS excludive
[1:40:45] ic3k0ld: there are people that paid 500$ to just follow Asmon around yesterday, that even crazier
[1:40:49] Holysal: tha was only for ks

[1:40:53] Holysal: that
[1:40:54] Zenfar_: just 12 months with the 500 one
[1:40:57] Ir1shguy: life time sub wa only with kickstarter
[1:40:58] MargaretKrohn: @Towelliee lifetime sub was an exclusive for Kickstarter.
[1:41:00] Mayern: you get 11 months now, but before it was lifetime @Towelliee
[1:41:01] Holysal: @Gizimoo86 yes
[1:41:10] mrblond5: that is a good deal if u are streamer
[1:41:20] Azathul: @Minaeki do you not understand what an alpha build is......
[1:41:23] CrowGuy: I thought ashes was B2P?
[1:41:26] exod44: @ic3k0ld People pay tens of dollars just to have him read a sentence. Compared to that, trolling him on cam for $500 is a low price
[1:41:27] Scarhearth: @MrGattz doesnt work the discord is full of idiots that dont understand what an alpha is for so its basically a fool and their money being easily parted
[1:41:32] SadDingus: this looks like GW2, that came out how many years ago?
[1:41:34] Freddy_Krueger: @Minaeki it won't be :) but do as you feel
[1:41:38] Asthea: @Minaeki it's an alpha, the graphics will change a lot by the time it gets released
[1:41:41] DABZ16: you should group with margaret and let her help you lvl
[1:41:41] nightxcl0ud: look at how responsive it is
[1:41:42] Hagazissa: Ashes will be pay to play, monthly fee
[1:41:43] Ir1shguy: too many failures I didnt take a chance with AoC but now regret it lol
[1:41:44] nightxcl0ud: lookgs greate
[1:41:46] UltimaGG: How fluid does the combat feel @Towelliee? Hard to tell from watching
[1:41:50] DoliTheFabulous: @MargaretKrohn How the testing been? You guys happy with it?
[1:41:58] mett7: man i invest in Camelot Unchaind and where is my game now?? Pepehand
[1:41:58] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:41:59] ic3k0ld: I paid 200$ for a lifetime sub of Lord of the Rings online years ago, got my money out of it too plus some
[1:41:59] sLogOG: any progress on Sylvanas?
[1:42:03] Davidjac: Heroic?
[1:42:05] MrGattz: @Scarhearth yeah but is the discord completely open or can you only get on the discord if you spend the 500?
[1:42:28] Dewulfi: @mett7 just wait, the beta will come in 2046
[1:42:30] Azathul: in actual game development (not steam early access money grabs), alpha builds are designed to test the core structures of the game, not the final graphical pass
[1:42:33] Stefan_x64: Sadge
[1:42:33] Mayern: open gattz
[1:42:37] ic3k0ld: @exod444 yeah, still fucking crazy
[1:42:39] Freddy_Krueger: @Minaeki yep, wont change much at all.
[1:42:42] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: @MargaretKrohn <3 <3
[1:42:43] Zzorski: is your guilds plan to go straight into mythic on release of mythics?
[1:42:45] tenkeboksen2k: @Towelliee You gonna play New world?
[1:42:48] MrGattz: well thats why the discord is full of idiots. its open to the public.
[1:42:53] mett7: @Dewulfi if there will be ever a beta LUL
[1:42:57] sLogOG: engine will be the same, but how the engine will work in time changes a lot Minaeki
[1:43:04] Glisur85: 7/20
[1:43:04] KulTheSavage: this month
[1:43:05] tenkeboksen2k: @Towelliee 20th
[1:43:05] rreaks: tomorrow? 2 days?
[1:43:05] raven_tm: jul 20, 10 days
[1:43:07] AbsoluteAL: 20th
[1:43:07] mrblond5: LUL
[1:43:10] xlSardonicuslx: Dmn it that girl gave me a cols sore last night!
[1:43:11] MrGattz: if it were only open to the people that spend 500 it would be fine
[1:43:11] rreaks: oh 10 days>
[1:43:12] MargaretKrohn: @WarcrimesVonButtStuff <3
[1:43:17] peatleg_pug: forgot flower back there
[1:43:21] nightxcl0ud: wooow this looks so good
[1:43:23] Scarhearth: @MrGattz its the 500$ part of it... so its the alpha testers part of the discord that has the morons
[1:43:26] MateusTD: cant you aoe that stuck guy?
[1:43:29] nightxcl0ud: those mechanics lol so responsive and looks so nice
[1:43:33] rreaks: @MargaretKrohn sodaWave
[1:43:33] suvysuv1: hi towel i remember back in the day i did a run with you on eu who needs cc omg so funny
[1:43:35] WarcrimesVonButtStuff: those spiders are extra creepy
[1:43:37] Dewulfi: @mett7 I bought 60$ pack for it on kickstarter and I count it as lost money at this point :D
[1:43:39] flickerzz94: !ashes
[1:43:40] ColdChillXI: 20th
[1:43:46] mrblond5: Toweliee how u like the combat ?
[1:43:48] flickerzz94: !ashes of creation
[1:43:48] ordeph: how much $ for beta?
[1:43:54] tenkeboksen2k: Im pretty hyped for new world. Looks amazing. Gonna take it nice and easy!
[1:43:54] Finansdepartementet: What's the tattoo u got on ur left arm?
[1:43:56] Skeletth: dead
[1:43:57] grumpnamedjosh: im just worried that if the game releases after 4 years that the game will run out of content before they take another couple years and another 3 alphas testing another expansion before its released. im just worried this is how their development will always be .
[1:44:00] Wayward_Son_: single gameplay looks cool but how is it looks like while in a party/raid
[1:44:02] Jollywhompus: Will beta progress carry over to launch?
[1:44:09] KulTheSavage: no
[1:44:17] mett7: @MargaretKrohn can i Roleplay as female dwarf with beard in this game?
[1:44:19] Hagazissa: Pretty sure they said on the kickstarter that it will take a long while before you get to see the alpha/beta builds, yet alone the full game
[1:44:21] ic3k0ld: the thing about new world i don't have faith in is Amazon
[1:44:21] ThaOriginalGamester: ???
[1:44:21] xhaven: New World is B2P
[1:44:22] JustinNotFoundx: LOL this game
[1:44:23] ThaOriginalGamester: LUL
[1:44:25] sLogOG: what is that spawn point? hahahaahahahah
[1:44:30] 9to5Andy: I haven't been following New World at all is the game promising?
[1:44:31] DABZ16: do you lose your herbs when you die?
[1:44:32] Kisswani: is there a sort of " road map " for the development process ?
[1:44:32] Angry_Sensei: New world beta is just pre order game
[1:44:43] Technogre: last time for new world all you had to do was buy the game and you got beta pretty sure
[1:44:44] DaBotta: Yeah new world beta you just need to pre purchase or sign up and hope to get lucky
[1:44:46] Waiden01: From all the upcoming MMORPGs I am looking forward to the Lost Ark the most. Will you play it at all?
[1:44:46] sLogOG: the game sent you back to the launcher to recreat your character
[1:45:02] Syllable_: gw2
[1:45:21] Scarhearth: @MrGattz the first alpha test when it was NDA you had morons bitching that its a waste of 500$ if theres no options window in an alpha test that not being able to mute the game sound was a game breaker and the devs should learn how to make a game if they cant even put a options menu
[1:45:25] tenkeboksen2k: @DaBotta Na, you get 100% beta on 20th if you preorder. you can test the game 1 month and cancel order if you dont like it
[1:45:33] SadDingus: making any new MMO from the ground up is a huge undertaking
[1:45:33] Recknry: There’s a huge difference between building an entire game and server infrastructure, and adding to that once it’s already established.
[1:45:39] coldhandsbeatz: I always want to get into SWTOR but never end up doing it. I saw they announced a new expansion
[1:45:51] ic3k0ld: Amazon's history with making games has been less than trash so far
[1:46:03] rreaks: lmao I feel like I can put 300 hours into an MMO im really into in a month
[1:46:15] ColdChillXI: swtor was the last mmo where I started at launch
[1:46:17] mett7: this game will be more focused on player driven content so lack of content should not be that big of a problem
[1:46:19] SaulMDGaming: I have gone back to OSRS to enjoy a nice grindy MMO
[1:46:19] weavling: Like how they are artificially gating SSC and TK in tbcc?
[1:46:20] xlSardonicuslx: played UO 6 yrs we made our own content with GvG, Rp, etc ...
[1:46:22] Funderik: time gating gives you things to look forward to the following weeks, story, rewards, new unlocks
[1:46:23] aWild4: @towelliee that's wrong the real way to timegate is to make games alt-friendly
[1:46:34] magorbob666: You can ERP in goldshire for couple years
[1:46:37] Azathul: Vanguard SOH was SOOO good.... until you got to end game and the Devs didnt have shit ready...... so people bailed on the game
[1:46:37] grumpnamedjosh: just depends if they gate it because its best for the players or if they gate it to pad recurring subs
[1:46:43] xlSardonicuslx: timegating doesnt affect pvp based mmos
[1:46:45] Aervyper: @Towelliee how long did it take for people to finish BC last month?
[1:46:49] sLogOG: Yeah but at what year? xlSardonicuslx
[1:46:52] lanara233: Would we class attunements as timegating?
[1:46:57] MogStreet: GW
[1:46:58] Pierx89: time gating is ok at the start of exp, on wow retail after 9 months I cant still farm fast soul ashes to craft new legendarie... it sucks. Just timegate me to rank em 5-6. not to make a new one
[1:46:58] xlSardonicuslx: thats the brilliance of pvp based game
[1:47:03] raven_tm: AoC will not be alt friendly lol
[1:47:18] Longlastnamae: tbc ded till next patch

[1:47:33] tenkeboksen2k: Can confirm, classic servers seems like its alot of raid login
[1:47:37] IPatrickl: are there currently any archetypes to classes?
[1:47:50] Flagman21: i hope new world is good on launch
[1:47:54] AlcheLUL: hopefully new world is fun for some months
[1:47:55] truffsekka: Maybe for people that got super lucky with drops.
[1:47:58] DeanoTV: Will aoc have addons?
[1:48:01] DeityoftheDeep: tbc aint dead
[1:48:02] Architank: I really like how FF14 does its class system
[1:48:03] mohbrkat: hope new world will be good
[1:48:04] DeityoftheDeep: tbc growing
[1:48:06] DeityoftheDeep: still
[1:48:06] Hagazissa: I think with the whole siege thinga in aoc they hope that the content droughts wont be that bad
[1:48:07] Putrescent1982: @Towelliee did you watch asmons stream when he killed that huge dragon?
[1:48:08] Truu_tv: IS new world still launching with the ingame boosting services ? kekw
[1:48:12] Bubba_T_Baggin: Is there a setting to turn off the Go Fast stripes when sprinting?
[1:48:13] tenkeboksen2k: Tbc is not growing lol
[1:48:14] DoliTheFabulous: @DeanoTV nope
[1:48:14] Recknry: @ipatrickl there are, but not in this alpha
[1:48:16] Ryukotsu: Its the wailing caverns PogChamp
[1:48:16] Nebulizer87: It’s B2P that launch month will be fun
[1:48:17] truffsekka: I made every reset and still don't have my phase 1 BiS items.
[1:48:20] The_Choob: I got 1000 hours in new world alpha, got my money worth already
[1:48:22] IReso: I think crafting will be really good in new world, not too sure about combat yet, but thats what im gonna play lost ark for
[1:48:22] Flagman21: wait new world isn't going to have a subscription fee?
[1:48:22] ordeph: i guess u blink jump into it
[1:48:26] IPatrickl: new world was pretty fun, it was just a shame how OP the hatchet was
[1:48:27] DeityoftheDeep: ur high
[1:48:32] Asthea: you can just jump up there
[1:48:49] mrblond5: i got 9 k hours into ESO and i still have lots of things to do
[1:48:50] lanara233: Thorium! :)
[1:48:58] Asthea: yes just jump
[1:49:17] vancoz: New world was okay. The combat system was terrible though
[1:49:18] Pallananana: have you tried jumping 4Head
[1:49:19] Asthea: not gonna backseat game LUL
[1:49:22] buttchild69: es OMEGALUL
[1:49:22] Angry_Sensei: There’s definitely a lot to cover in new world that will take some serious time to %100
[1:49:22] Longlastnamae: what is this? A library made for ants?
[1:49:22] grumpnamedjosh: "it just works"
[1:49:24] xaeblue: I'm enthusiastic about New World, I'm just worried how their support system will be. They already have shitty customer support as it is
[1:49:28] DeanoTV: can u even customise the UI in this? hate nameplates at the top
[1:49:35] SmokinR: Is there no loot
[1:49:42] PexaU: Pretty minor but I dont like the damage font LUL
[1:49:46] 9to5Andy: all cast is
[1:49:48] Bazsidiver: Alcast streams
[1:49:51] Azathul: 9K hours, hasnt left the starter city
[1:49:54] buttchild69: eso is a game completely designed to advertise their cash shop. its so brutally in your face
[1:50:00] coldhandsbeatz: Damage/heal numbers look terrible tbh
[1:50:00] belfastcl: alcast and jdub stream the trial hardmodes
[1:50:06] PrimalRain: 9k seems like a ton of afking then
[1:50:07] jasonbriggs: could this game be the wow killer
[1:50:11] DoliTheFabulous: @DeanoTV mate this is an technical alpha UI is the last thing the make a pass on before release
[1:50:11] DABZ16: i think the basic attack cooldown is a little too fast
[1:50:15] Wolfegang16: turn around and go up the ledge for the flower
[1:50:22] RPGtheodor: How does the game feel so far?
[1:50:33] Brandonhipster: @jasonbriggs Blizzard is the WoW killer
[1:50:39] WastedWookiee: ^^]
[1:50:43] mellowthorn1: @buttchild69 ok
[1:50:45] Asthea: @Wolfegang16 yupp, just jump up LUL
[1:50:47] PexaU: Also, is that sprint screen glow really necessary lol
[1:50:49] evaldas92: Are you going to make a video with impressions? Otherwise, how does the combat feel? :)
[1:50:54] xlSardonicuslx: Activision is Wow killer
[1:50:54] Mahdimtl: Is this Ashes of Creation?
[1:51:08] Nebulizer87: ESO is a great casual mmo imo
[1:51:12] suvysuv1: you need to resurect who needs cc .they were so funny watching the healers struggle
[1:51:12] Wolfegang16: @Asthea you just have no idea
[1:51:12] jasonbriggs: @Brandonhipster your not wrong there
[1:51:20] coldhandsbeatz: Yes @mahdimtl . The technical alpha
[1:51:21] DeanoTV: @PolayasDoli im just wondering if it will be a thing, just checked customization is planned
[1:51:29] mrblond5: The dodge works like in dark souls or is just there to gain distance ?
[1:51:33] Asthea: @Wolfegang16 I do, I've done it multiple times, that's why I'm agreeing with you
[1:51:35] buttchild69: predatory mmo
[1:51:38] WastedWookiee: When 9.1 drops and Towel and Asmon are playing everything else. LUL
[1:51:40] The_Choob: lol
[1:51:42] Toradin: story heavy yes
[1:51:43] thejellybeanking1: is looks really fun to play
[1:51:44] Bazsidiver: questing is best in eso
[1:51:48] Toradin: and its cool
[1:51:49] DoliTheFabulous: @DeanoTV dont know if its planned but usually its one of the last things done
[1:51:49] 9to5Andy: same
[1:51:51] Mahdimtl: @alexfdez17 Thank you
[1:51:57] jigzaw2020: ESO is fun
[1:51:58] Chriell: yes and story
[1:51:58] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:51:59] IReso: imperial city pvp dlc in ESO when it first came out was some of the most fun ive ever had in an mmo
[1:51:59] buttchild69: guys before you log out, make sure to TRIPLE check the crown store! you might miss this sale!!!
[1:52:03] ThaOriginalGamester: i played ESO for the lore... never grouped
[1:52:05] INLViper: Will ashes of creation be free to play ?
[1:52:08] 9to5Andy: skyshards too :)
[1:52:09] SadDingus: exploring is fun
[1:52:09] coldhandsbeatz: I always here something similar with SWTOR. You would play for the story mainly
[1:52:19] love_eggplant: hey towel
[1:52:22] dannexx: is this mage?
[1:52:22] mellowthorn1: @buttchild69 cringe
[1:52:23] love_eggplant: is there a level cap in the alpha?
[1:52:30] DABZ16: fall damage isnt causing you to lose health
[1:52:46] buttchild69: @mrham2398 simp
[1:52:46] AlcheLUL: talent trees are kind lackluster
[1:52:51] suddenqt: whats up with the glasses?
[1:52:52] mrblond5: i did every single quests in ESO
[1:52:53] mrrazputin: So this is the game thats sopose to be up on the market in about 1 year ?
[1:52:58] mellowthorn1: @buttchild69 irrelevant
[1:52:58] xaeblue: 20% increased crit? Makes it sound like numbers stay low lol
[1:53:01] Azathul: im not a fan of the zerg on zerg PVP, i prefer small 5-10 man skirmishes out in the open PvP area.
[1:53:03] ic3k0ld: if you're not playing the story or enjoying it where is the RPG in the game?!
[1:53:18] IPatrickl: @mrrazputin no lol, where do people get all this wrong info LULW
[1:53:28] Obsolithion: @mrrazputin 2-3 years at this point.
[1:53:31] thejellybeanking1: @towelliee how is it going do you like it
[1:53:31] grumpnamedjosh: that drain life skill isnt very good
[1:53:36] buttchild69: @mrham2398 hope you loaded up on mount speed boosters
[1:53:41] DeanoTV: ye this wont be out for a few years atleast
[1:53:50] ShadyWizWolf: @mrham2398 @buttchild69 Take the hate to whispers please. :)
[1:54:01] Tazer_Dan: who are we talking about?
[1:54:04] Nebulizer87: Ruin is fucking huge
[1:54:12] Raugdel: Ruin gaming
[1:54:13] ShadyWizWolf: Gooooood Morning Squad and HHIC @Towelliee :)
[1:54:15] ZoS0: Runi from GW2?
[1:54:15] Moobot: towRF TBC CLASSIC Limited Edition TOWELLIEE shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towRF
[1:54:17] Tazer_Dan: ahh
[1:54:20] ZoS0: Ruin*
[1:54:20] Nebulizer87: Been around since my early days always zerging
[1:54:23] Chriell: in second setlement you can buy mount
[1:54:32] DABZ16: but i think the size of the world makes it where zerg guilds can be ignored
[1:54:35] Flagman21: wildstar POGGERS
[1:54:37] mellowthorn1: @buttchild69 I never bought the game
[1:54:41] Kisswani: I only found out about them during the battle of Nazjatar
[1:54:49] ShadyWizWolf: Same @Kisswani
[1:54:56] darwin5g: i love Towelliee's tactical assault rifle safety goggle whkle
[1:55:03] darwin5g: while gaming
[1:55:06] nixter93: @Towelliee how is the ability response time in comparison to WoW? does it feel fluid?
[1:55:07] ZoS0: Had a blast with them on GW2 realm vs Realm
[1:55:28] darwin5g: allen its fluid
[1:55:31] Azathul: i never play my intended main in alpha/betas
[1:55:32] jweazy9: bro the alpha key is $500 is that right?
[1:55:36] Waspire: they also use a addon in wow called greenwall. it can cross server communicate,
[1:55:39] Dridikos: @Towelliee thoughts on Ashes?
[1:55:43] Chriell: @Jw0p ye
[1:55:54] ShadyWizWolf: I think they are a MMO guild lol
[1:55:56] Sarocus: I was in Ruin in Warhammer. We where the biggest on Chaos side
[1:55:59] Tazer_Dan: warhammer mmo was cool at 1st
[1:56:02] belfastcl: warhammer was fun to play
[1:56:05] Sarocus: Sorry, destro side
[1:56:06] MoneyGrubs: Did you play Lineage 2?
[1:56:08] ShadyWizWolf: New MMO? BAM. Ruin's there. lol
[1:56:09] apopthis: I miss warhammer :(
[1:56:11] TigasLIVE: @Towelliee Are you enjoying Ashes of creation?
[1:56:12] Neizrc: are you going to try sword of legends @Towelliee ?
[1:56:12] aye_kram: loved warhammer
[1:56:14] nixter93: @darwin5g if that is true, thats huge. everything else can be ironed out. but a good engine is big for me. When you press a button the ability should go off without delay
[1:56:15] IPatrickl: @Jw0p the alpha key is apart of the 500$ package, if your buying only for alpha, your paying way too much
[1:56:15] ic3k0ld: the way some of this games setup sounds, it won't be fun for solo'ish players or casuals
[1:56:20] darwin5g: you went to work, that was your mistake
[1:56:23] mellowthorn1: Warhammer had an mmo?
[1:56:28] MoneyGrubs: @Towelliee Did you Play Lineage 2?
[1:56:31] belfastcl: the warhammer private server has been online for longer than the retail version lol
[1:56:51] SchnitzL4u: 1
[1:56:55] Broseidon07: ResidentSleeper
[1:56:56] darwin5g: allen : agree, lag is a sign of poor software engineering
[1:56:56] jasonbriggs: @Towelliee did you ever play rift?
[1:56:59] Folkja: I liked that part of warhammer
[1:56:59] ZoS0: I was a Bright Mage I think they called it
[1:57:08] thecynicalshuffler: yeah public event.. pretty cool idea for the time
[1:57:11] Chriell: asssert dominance
[1:57:17] xaeblue: Would be cool if they added dmg on blink arrive
[1:57:21] SchnitzL4u: 2
[1:57:23] ic3k0ld: you can blink into them as well
[1:57:24] SchnitzL4u: 3
[1:57:29] SchnitzL4u: 4
[1:57:37] SchnitzL4u: 5
[1:57:38] mett7: combo tank + mage = blink tank :O
[1:57:41] Chriell: wel ye its armord
[1:57:47] comertogluegemen: isint there a loot in this game
[1:57:54] TigasLIVE: @Towelliee Are you enjoying Ashes of creation?
[1:58:10] anamroth: colision dmg with blink
[1:58:15] Catspaw66: cleric pretty strong. seem capable of one shotting while getting health and mana back .
[1:58:17] ShadyWizWolf: If a game has a tank class, you know @Towelliee is gonna try it KEKW
[1:58:28] Longlastnamae: Armor should protect you from fire balls. What would be cool is if your armor got hotter while you took hits and cause dot dmg
[1:58:32] SmokinR: So NPC have no loot
[1:58:37] FutileDiploma: How you feeling overall with their progress from closed beta
[1:58:46] FutileDiploma: Closes alpha sorry
[1:58:48] xaeblue: Maybe closed beta or something
[1:58:57] Kulture1: tbh this game feels so bland in every aspect
[1:58:59] MateusTD: I'm hyped for this game for like 5 months now
[1:59:03] darwin5g: towelliee' glasses makes him ready for 1. ashes of creation, 2. flashbangs going off in his basement
[1:59:14] love_eggplant: wow alphas arent real alphas
[1:59:30] love_eggplant: their engine is already set in stone
[1:59:30] Virus2508: god i hate the running shit on the screen
[1:59:47] IPatrickl: @darwin5g yeah those things look bulletproof
[1:59:50] Nardap: if you play the game now up until release you might be bored of the most content by the time it is released
[1:59:53] sLogOG: yeah wow alpha is just content test
[1:59:55] Kulture1: alpha usually means 'feature complete' so all features are somehow in the game @love_eggplant
