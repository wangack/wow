[0:32:30] Roflrobbie: hey fam. happy patch day
[0:32:51] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:33:04] fetza108: Pog  󠀀

[0:33:39] Roflrobbie: <3 <3 <3
[0:33:45] Haestoh: 3 Way
[0:33:47] lyreilla: That was my thought too, I don't recall seeing smooching before.
[0:33:48] AdamShwaginz: true lol
[0:33:49] bigbadbeardo: <3!!!!
[0:33:50] fetza108: nice moments
[0:33:51] RoronoaZoro20: while Illidan is fighting Sargeras. How is that faire ?
[0:34:19] bigbadbeardo: the golden rule
[0:34:36] grump42: grump42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:35:12] Rokir_: Malfurion and Tyrande adopted Shandris because they cannot have children
[0:35:31] bigbadbeardo: LOL
[0:36:11] fetza108: KEKW
[0:37:05] Rokir_: The Teldrassil line is a pretty big promise that I really hope they know what they're doing lol
[0:37:15] DevoidX: it does say 'one day' they'll go back to Teldrassil
[0:37:46] Pathstrider: i found that 1
[0:39:07] invictus_DK: where is that mount from?
[0:40:15] BBMezzy: I wish Champion of the DFs had been a title reward. Would've been a nice callback to Champion of the Frozen Wastes
[0:41:21] Rokir_: There are 3 Mounts with absolutely broken tectures
[0:41:24] Haestoh: Champion of Dragons would be a cool title the "Dragonflight" bit doesnt make sense. It's like being called "Champion of the Wrath of the Lich King"
[0:41:25] RAF_Sean: Good morning sir
[0:41:38] Rokir_: Cindermane Charger
[0:41:50] Rokir_: RAF
[0:42:53] RAF_Sean: That mount goes hard
[0:42:54] buMf00d: LUL
[0:43:10] BBMezzy: @imjoeski Not really, "the Dragonflights" refers to the 5 flights. Not quite the same
[0:43:43] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:43:51] fetza108: this is the mount
[0:43:59] fetza108: looking great
[0:44:00] Shrenko: hi Dan happy patch launch day
[0:44:08] Haestoh: @bbmezzy Champion of the Flights I think sound’s better if that’s the case. “The Dragonflights” just sounds a bit wordy
[0:44:17] Rokir_: Raven Lords Beak was untextured, and the red Infernal Mount had lines all over
[0:45:20] mohaso21: there is like 2 quests on top of seat of aspects aswell
[0:45:37] mohaso21: one with alextraza
[0:45:40] mohaso21: and one with vyranoth
[0:45:41] mohaso21: ye

[1:14:54] JakeSezz: Oh did you see my tweet with some of my XP findings from Follower Dungeons? I was curious how much the XP changed between PTR & Live
[1:15:21] BBMezzy: The low rep and currency gains worry me, but maybe it'll be better when they make the event work properly
[1:15:28] Orzorg: When do you think they will change starting zone for night elves?

[1:16:43] Uchiha_Cloaky: Lowet seome graphics maybe?
[1:16:44] JakeSezz: Yeah I wasn’t tracking the gold so much as wanted to see the XP portion, since that seemed to be a sticking point. Since it’s Normal difficulty, I wasn’t expecting a lot in the way of drops any way
[1:16:45] BBMezzy: Have they responded to you?

[1:27:43] laurab28291: wish there was more collection ones though
[1:28:17] BBMezzy: By having all your chars automatically in it. Don't see the community when on alts
[1:29:21] BBMezzy: What is a battlenet community? Because MrGM friends isn't I don't think?
[1:29:27] laurab28291: that really threw me xD
[1:29:39] laurab28291: went to naz, wanted to fly and hit a ceiling hahah

[1:32:38] str4ysheep: there are to many people bugging this quest. tried it in warmode and there it worked because there were no people around
[1:33:10] kustardk: Can you do a guide on this am so lost XD
[1:33:14] BBMezzy: World quests that weren't testable on PTR are also bugged
[1:33:19] laurab28291: and this is why im not rushing to do it xD
[1:33:47] flavio_ago: "problems since launch"  might refer to that
[1:34:15] BBMezzy: I'd rather they do less encrypting and just test things on PTR than launch patches like this
[1:34:16] ChickSwag: i got to do it with abandon the quest a couple of times and then it ended up working.
[1:34:54] ChickSwag: the problem is that the dirt isn't spawning, and it spawns on new when u start the quest again
[1:35:58] str4ysheep: i think it is not meant to be influenced by others but it is somehow
[1:36:19] xwowkillax: KEKW

[2:12:42] fanimir: There's a lot of "Gilnean Workers" doing what I'm assuming is rebuilding, so that could make sense yeah
[2:13:12] S3N71: My worgen would set their HS there :)
[2:13:22] MediumRareOG: People get mad at the idea of adding druid to more races and you don't think they'll get mad when you blow up Stormwind? That's... optimistic :)

[2:49:22] Iwony: It is so funny but as an Altoholic with 40+ chars the most hyped feature for War within is really the war band :D

[3:32:37] MachoCham: At that point if we're close to them then it becomes that Pseudo "Uncle/Auntie" thing
[3:32:43] MediumRareOG: "once removed" means 1 generation away from whatever cousin. So 3rd cousin, twice removed is through your great grandfather (3rd cousin), grandchild of that (twice removed)

[3:41:01] michaelmm: If you were rich you could employ someone to make you look good in that outfit!
[3:41:13] MachoCham: Is this a follower dungeon?
[3:41:19] MachoCham: Or did you just abandon them
[3:41:23] RAF_Sean: Just a regular girl and her regular family taking super regular Christmas photos

[3:42:13] knight4rk: rich people dont cook
[3:42:15] Annathebanana1986: they dont cook :P
[3:42:16] xwowkillax: because its too much clutter you dont have to be rich to know that LUL
[3:42:17] Harai_Ulfsark: they have someone always cleaning and storing stuff i guess
[3:42:19] GFairyGaming: The secret is that rich people have 2 kitchens, one for cooking and one for show
[3:42:23] knight4rk: they go nout to eat and get takeaways
[3:42:25] s_0lst1ce: it's prbably only put away for the pictures and then gets taken back out for day to day stuff
[3:42:29] RAF_Sean: Thise are questions for the live in cook and cleaners
[3:42:35] s_0lst1ce: or they have a butlers pantry where it is all put away
[3:42:39] JakeSezz: I wouldn’t consider myself rich, but yeah, I keep em in cabinets and keep my air fryer in the pantry. But my kettle stays out on the counter
[3:42:39] NIICKLAS_TV: yoo
[3:42:46] xwowkillax: my wife has way too much shit on the kitchen counter its so annoying
[3:42:46] Harai_Ulfsark: ask her to make a video about it

[3:44:38] MachoCham: Yeah the 10.1 mega dungeon the name escapes me
[3:44:42] chefdejour82: I was doing follower Azure Vault and the npc kept bugging out so I had to lead

[3:45:49] Harai_Ulfsark: @MachoCham yeah but not easy to get a group running on a hunter
[3:45:57] Larkaro: Convinced these Gilneas glasses don't exsist
[3:46:05] knight4rk: do they interrupt and stuff?
[3:46:05] xwowkillax: its not as easy but yes you can do it solo
[3:46:39] Yin_AKA_Ethan: @MrGM How do you activate the followers? you just go in the dung solo?
[3:46:49] JakeSezz: Yep! They interrupt like crazy and even drink when they’re OOM
[3:46:59] Yin_AKA_Ethan: Ahhh, TY
[3:47:18] chefdejour82: the mage makes a table also lol
[3:47:26] Harai_Ulfsark: the druid doesnt use soothe tho :(

[3:47:30] RAF_Sean: Does the mage drop a table?

[3:54:57] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to gorkamorka41782! 
[3:55:09] Harai_Ulfsark: i mean chrome also did something similar before
[3:55:19] Harai_Ulfsark: and it used the whole screen
[3:55:44] chefdejour82: did you do the epilogue yet
[3:55:44] Cabbageman007: Do the boats at the new docks in the emerald green work or go anywhere?
[3:55:52] thunduz: are they vanilla for the classic people
[3:56:29] Harai_Ulfsark: first kiss really surprised me

[3:56:46] MachoCham: Corgi goggles time!
[3:56:59] RosieSeren: talk to alex and then she sends you
[3:56:59] LuiBMHunter: two in seat of the aspects
[3:57:10] Harai_Ulfsark: also im so glad they added most if not all of the weekly quests to the adventure guide
[3:57:13] LuiBMHunter: one from alex and one from frost girl
[3:57:54] thunduz: to piss you off
[3:57:56] skewlbeta: they have scent glands in their claws. Marking territory.
[3:57:57] databob1: shes marking
[3:58:02] LuiBMHunter: hinting you need to vacuum
[3:58:02] Promilie: Cats have scent glands in their paws. She's marking territory
[3:58:02] Iwony: the have scent glands on their feet I believe
[3:58:05] Harai_Ulfsark: they like the texture of untouched carpet
[3:58:06] michaelmm: In the wild they scratch to wear their claws down and stop them overgrowing.
[3:58:08] Furamire: sent glans in hands i believe
[3:58:11] snuskedven: territorial i think
[3:58:15] Mystic_Bard: @thunduz but mainly this ^^
[3:58:16] Larkaro: need to get her a stratching post in your office
[3:58:22] thunduz: mrgmHehe
[3:58:25] Annathebanana1986: i literally have 10 scratch posts around the house to avoid mine doing that
[3:58:29] LuiBMHunter: put ickle gloves on her paws :)
[3:58:30] funviking99: mrgmG
[3:58:33] skewlbeta: she's DIYing.
[3:58:47] chefdejour82: cats hate closed doors
[3:58:48] RosieSeren: my cat once trapped in a room by scratching up the carpet so the door couldn't open xD
[3:58:59] databob1: and it feels good on her claws helps keeps them sharp...
[3:59:16] Harai_Ulfsark: i have 2 scratching boards to my cat, one is a carpet like thing glued to a big wooden board, and another is made of cardboard
[3:59:44] trollbrand: she is trying to find Iridakron
[3:59:49] thunduz: shes just sitting there thinking youre trying to replace her and thats why you went to the cat cafe. shes acting out
[4:00:28] skewlbeta: is she posessive of the baby?
[4:00:34] databob1: cats can be really social creatures so if she's trying to get in the bathroom with you she ether misses you or is looking for water
[4:01:03] xwowkillax: CoolCat BabyRage
[4:01:05] MachoCham: I can bring mine down then KEKW
[4:01:13] thunduz: grab onto the tail and pull

[4:01:55] Mystic_Bard: that's so cute :D
[4:02:03] mattzomix: it's a good beta test ;)
[4:02:13] Larkaro: Edward Mining Hands
[4:02:59] keyboardturner: i think the more people the less tasks you'll get because of server queuing but that means more time to dig artifacts while waiting. I think you get the top bar filled faster with higher population but the tradeoff is less tasks
[4:03:31] snagprophet: good afternoon
[4:03:40] Iwony: you can dig the atrifacts without a taask
[4:04:01] snagprophet: alright, i just did some flat cleaning, I am annoyed my mum got snow and we didn't
[4:05:06] MachoCham: In my heart
[4:05:27] michaelmm: -14 is far above what we see in some parts of Scotland in winter.
[4:05:36] michaelmm: Some of the glens get -25.
[4:05:50] michaelmm: We even hit -20 in Edinburgh in 2010.
[4:06:08] Ironhide_Gaming: its been negative temps where i live for over a week
[4:06:23] michaelmm: I think some newspapers are on something good if they think it's breaking records up here this winter it's only -5.

[4:06:37] Phenroi: 20k for mount
[4:06:38] Orzorg: 20000 i think
[4:06:44] Ironhide_Gaming: Did they add different currencies in this patch? just what we need.
[4:07:12] adampanerabread: they had to have nerfed this. on my first dig, i got the mount and 2 tmogs. ever since then i've gotten nothing
[4:07:16] thunduz: The NA beta test yesterday failed you
[4:07:25] Ironhide_Gaming: The issue i have is the clutter of all the items in my bags.
[4:07:39] lyreilla: We're slowly coming out of our deep freeze. It's been so cold, all the non highway roads are snow packed and ice still, so driving in town can be rough. Can't wait for it to warm up and they can get cleaned up.
[4:07:42] Iwony: well... I will not do this in a raid anymore this is stupid, could not even tag the boss before it died.
[4:07:45] mattzomix: i wonder why the boss is attacking with shadowflame
[4:07:48] Iwony: urgh patch day
[4:07:55] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:08:22] Mystic_Bard: Nice !!

[4:08:28] Iwony: Quest
[4:08:46] databob1: @MrGM I used your video and got all the elf transmogs thank you
[4:08:48] Iwony: so do not do the traitors rest in a raid group
[4:08:53] Bware2: we lost a currency also :) shiny pet something... getting alot of the polished ones in the mail
[4:09:05] laurab28291: new update for ATT :D
[4:09:25] BBMezzy: pet charms also stack to 5k now instead of 1k
[4:09:43] JamesWaudby: yeah they're account bound
[4:09:53] Iwony: we have account bound currencies now
[4:09:56] Iwony: no?
[4:09:57] UlthraneDK: When I was in the Military (Canada) I was stationed close up north in the Artic, a place called Alert, cold doesn't bother me anymore mrgmKEKW
[4:10:14] kaeleirra: Traders tender is acct bound
[4:10:23] michaelmm: Account currencies work through the Bnet shop and are prone to being very buggy.
[4:10:36] Vaephera: Hopefully warband stuff improves it
[4:10:47] Bware2: @BBMezzy thanks... freed up some bankspace
[4:10:47] michaelmm: Hopefully somehting they will be working on for Warbands.
[4:11:05] laurab28291: iv had another one sent to me :)
[4:11:16] keyboardturner: after living in alaska for years, i will always forever prefer it being cold and requiring extra blankets as opposed to it being too hot and not having AC
[4:11:25] Mystic_Bard: I live quite south, that only summer bothers me, since it is not really winter here anymore
[4:11:37] straws_man: like the darkmoon faire tickets
[4:11:40] adampanerabread: wait did blizzard mess up again...
[4:11:52] adampanerabread: i picked up the azerothian archives quest on my alt and it also gives 5k fragments
[4:11:58] JamesWaudby: But UK winter is longer than UK summer so colder for longer!

[4:14:11] adampanerabread: yeah i will
[4:14:48] Bware2: sounds like a pug not follower dungeon ;)
[4:14:55] xwowkillax: MrDestructoid we were changing our loot
[4:15:05] Harai_Ulfsark: i wish i could use the follower dungeons to farm the toxic LW recipes, but those dont drop in normal i guess
[4:15:17] Mystic_Bard: is it 10 per acc or 10 per char ?
[4:15:34] xwowkillax: they rezzed Pog
[4:15:35] adampanerabread: I logged out and back in and the fragments are gone. i wonder if it would've actually given me fragments if i didnt log out
[4:15:54] xwowkillax: MrDestructoid cant kill us
[4:15:59] Bware2: what ilvl is dropping in normal?
[4:16:04] mattzomix: do you know if they fixed soloing bfa content?
[4:16:10] timex1: any idea if they doing this for all dungeons or just dragonflight forward now
[4:16:17] Bware2: hmm cool
[4:16:26] Nulgar: @adampanerabread I assume it was an accidental weekly reset, and they ran a script to remove double gains
[4:17:13] adampanerabread: okay my dh has fragments for the quest. i won't log out this time LUL
[4:17:17] siggyfisk: Hewwo TwitchConHYPE

[4:19:43] siggyfisk: Because the famous people are depressed in the winter and need a pick me up
[4:19:57] auberji: better call saul got robbed
[4:20:12] Harai_Ulfsark: i think so they can award the productions from the previous year once its entirely over?
[4:20:33] Raghoulash_: because of the writers and actors guild went on strike
[4:20:38] chefdejour82: the slap
[4:20:47] fanimir: @auberji yep
[4:21:07] fanimir: how many times did they get nominated again?
[4:21:07] michaelmm: Maybe more filming takes place in summer so easier to get attendees in winter?

[4:50:09] michaelmm: Marquis Brownlee (really big consumer teach youtuber) has a vision pro and really likes it but has been finding it to be too heavy with long term use.
[4:51:05] Akela3: yeah strapping a chunk of aluminum and glass to your face is probably not going to be super comfortable for long periods no matter what they do

[4:53:41] MachoCham: Oh VR. It's not that you can't talk about it, it's just that it's all you talk about and it becomes a bit oppressive to the stream.
[4:53:46] Pathstrider: you auto learn that toy as a non worgen by relogging

[5:03:28] Iwony: hope they fix it in ne next days
[5:03:30] beezelebaub: using the interact key makes it a lot easier to target them
[5:03:30] shaypressplay: clicke the progress bar
[5:03:43] Thoreya: LUL
[5:04:07] Clodagh_Lunaria: Would suck ass
[5:04:11] Lausten: 50% of their playerbase would stop instantly

[5:04:14] chefdejour82: lol
[5:04:24] thunduz: why would I want WoW reset and lose everything?
[5:04:33] khalcrux_gaming: New world but everything ported over
[5:04:37] nyrhalahotep: from a Dev standpoint, that would be a nightmare
[5:04:59] Harai_Ulfsark: that's how you kill a game
[5:05:19] Lausten: @thunduz Asmongold comes to mind, and to me it seems he only wants it cause hes realised with DFA that hes actually not number 1 and never was.. LUL
[5:05:35] bell1972: Hard Core Retail incoming Folks !!!!   LUL
[5:05:36] Bnichoo: WOW 2 is just a MOBA and we lose everything

[5:06:07] Nostoroth: next slide
[5:06:12] Cooperharley0204: performance is through the roof
[5:06:12] nyrhalahotep: imagine everything you have invested into your characters over the years, from that developer standpoint, multiply that by 1000, a reset simply isn't feasible
[5:06:39] TruVillainManny: Hey Dan and chat. Hope you're doing well.
[5:07:00] Larkaro: Is it the Clayscale Hornstrider mount?
[5:07:17] Cooperharley0204: I meant the wow server not your PC :)
[5:07:29] TruVillainManny: So many people... how is that possible in this "dead game"
[5:07:29] Cooperharley0204: oh gotcha
[5:07:35] Larkaro: Well if you makes you feels any better, I just got it
[5:07:36] Bnichoo: forcing my followers to do M+ pulls in a normal dungeon
[5:07:38] MachoCham: @TruVillainManny Follower world events
[5:07:45] adampanerabread: my rep is going up extremely slowly with the azerothian archives. how much do we need again? LUL
[5:07:48] MediumRareOG: A reset would give me a good excuse to quit, like Iron Man dying and Marven
[5:07:54] Cooperharley0204: let me do a +20 follower dungeon
[5:08:03] MediumRareOG: Marvel I mean
[5:08:07] Tegger37: interestingly, you can quit a follower instance without deserter debuff.
[5:08:28] adampanerabread: and it's every hour
[5:08:28] MachoCham: Maybe it's based on performance Kappa
[5:08:38] Bnichoo: he said the funny number Kappa
[5:08:45] colingoodwin: 420 😏
[5:08:48] colingoodwin: 😎
[5:08:58] Pathstrider: day 1 then

[5:09:22] Xesol: time to reroll human
[5:09:28] Bnichoo: better start lining up that coke then
[5:09:59] Bnichoo: no contracts either i think?
[5:11:03] beezelebaub: and you need 238k fragments for all the rewards D:
[5:11:17] LuiBMHunter: 8 x 3 = 24?
[5:12:00] Lausten: Sounds similar to Time Rifts, that was 1k weekly from the quest
[5:12:03] beezelebaub: that's what ATT says D:
[5:12:11] MediumRareOG: It sounds like a chore you'll be doing forever, like Rajani or Uldum Accord

[5:13:11] Vaephera: There's world quests as well which are pretty quick, I got 1k from the three that were up today, and I'm pretty sure there's more to unlock as you rank up
[5:13:13] BBMezzy: It seems like they designed it like the time rifts but without the chance to get the loot from the event itself because the event loot and the currency loot are different sets
[5:13:26] Bnichoo: realistically it shouldn't be that long with the amount of drops you'd get
[5:13:33] Iwony: but the stuff also drops from the bags
[5:13:43] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[5:13:49] nyrhalahotep: and you know the developers did that exact same calculation in their offices
[5:13:56] Larkaro: no one will be doing this in War Within
[5:14:01] Akela3: not even a year? casual grind.
[5:14:03] Pathstrider: can u do that hourly event without doing the archive intro quests?
[5:14:11] Bnichoo: closest thing we get to a R14 grind in current wow LUL
[5:14:43] Tegger37: the boss dropped Excavator's Pack of FIndings which isn't sold by the Az Archives vendor. didn't know other things dropped.
[5:15:10] thereal_stmarie: @Pathstrider  yes

[5:16:55] Lausten: hampapLoot
[5:16:59] Ironhide_Gaming: Im getting my legendary axe this week. i feel it
[5:17:06] WoWRoach: I have the same luck with follower dungeons, I've done 4 this morning and no loot
[5:17:09] Iwony: did they not say there were more events out in the world?
[5:17:14] Iwony: smaller ones?
[5:17:16] Ironhide_Gaming: except i only run LFR. probably doesnt drop there
[5:17:50] Bnichoo: are follower dungeons random or do you get to pick which one?
[5:18:09] Tegger37: if you do it as a follower instance, you can head to the boss you need.  I'm trying to get the ring from 2nd boss for mount.
[5:18:13] Phenroi: Small chance, but yes, Leggo can drop in LFR
[5:18:13] Ironhide_Gaming: I get the boost on LFR so i would assume it does
[5:18:22] Tegger37: then leave if it doesn't drop

[5:20:56] Getcha_Pulll: by ave how many lvls can those 10 runs get?
[5:21:01] funviking99: the digging quests are bugged or something? they are awful
[5:21:23] Pathstrider: LFR can drop the axe
[5:21:28] Pathstrider: just very low chance

[5:21:55] Ironhide_Gaming: @Pathstrider I am seeing this now as well.

[5:23:42] Phenroi: Shouldn't need quest, I got them to drop without the quest
[5:23:42] Onisekai: doenst it drop only in hc and myth?
