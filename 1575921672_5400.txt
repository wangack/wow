[1:32:23] Frank4LuLz: asmon server = shit show
[1:32:31] Mecabeast: can't wait to hear th3 complains streamers are playing on the fresh servers
[1:32:33] jhopps12: @Rottencoarse it got removed, false ban
[1:32:46] Thoreya: ^
[1:32:50] Frank4LuLz: gold cap
[1:33:01] im_capy: he might do it to meme or for "content" for about a day and then be done
[1:33:05] iisobase: Asmon would never re level on a fresh server lol
[1:33:16] PvtHudson093: DBW will got for goldcap

[1:35:27] HaloS23: @Towelliee Hey, I have been thinking of moving my main to Illidan from Earthen Ring. Guild and server seem to be dead. good idea or stay where i am?

[1:37:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: name and race change are coming soon

[1:42:08] PigPenLen: Towelliee or chat - new to the game, what is the best rule of thumb in determining distance (yards) on screen. 20 yrds, 40 yrds, etc/
[1:42:29] atrexy_: you don't have alot of dps fr a 15 tho
[1:42:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just get 'er done! LUL
[1:43:25] nintendyoh: 4.5k DH
[1:43:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Determining distance on screen is kind of tough, there might be addons for that, I would say just practice gets you a feel for range
[1:43:40] Daarksyde: towLets towGo towLets towGo
[1:43:43] Scoodles91: you are hard carrying that DH
[1:43:53] cappei: @th3phantomlord You could download an addon/WeakAura that shows distance to current target
[1:43:54] draftbrew: hellllll yeah
[1:43:54] Mecabeast: I got 4 15s done this week debating whether to do 4 more tonight

[1:44:48] mayonaes: DH's are bottom feeders right now
[1:44:58] mayonaes: DPS wise
[1:45:02] mayonaes: no not 6k
[1:45:04] Krue_Sr: DH Tank ain't bad
[1:45:10] PigPenLen: @wEiRdO_dUdE yeah I am finding that difficult to determine when needing to keep people within 40
[1:45:22] mayonaes: if we was geared he should be around 10k-12k
[1:45:25] nintendyoh: oh they timed it
[1:45:29] MerffTV: its super unfun DH and the meta sucks
[1:45:37] PigPenLen: @rawcult cool - I will look for this one
[1:45:40] Xynth25: @towelliee DH's problem is that they have to play ST even in aoe for Sinful Brand play
[1:45:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would say 40 yards is easier to deal with, if your abilities go that far
[1:45:45] MerffTV: Echo
[1:45:46] dimofodi: Echo
[1:45:47] Banjo586: guess who
[1:45:48] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  echo did
[1:45:48] Banjo586: KEKW
[1:45:48] mattisthegreat: Echo
[1:45:50] Exray2: echo won by tiebreaker
[1:45:51] MerffTV: tiebreaker
[1:45:52] atrexy_: echo
[1:45:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo won it, but it was a real race
[1:45:56] skymercii: @Towelliee did you still need my 15 gambit?
[1:45:56] dimofodi: Echo, tied score won by total time
[1:45:56] falldrgn: Echo
[1:46:03] Mecabeast: echo just edged it out
[1:46:10] PigPenLen: @wEiRdO_dUdE yes def easier than 20!
[1:46:14] MerffTV: tghey missed a 33 Work by like ten seconds
[1:46:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Monka was in 1st for awhile
[1:46:19] dankmeliodas: DH is alright single target but they have no aoe outside of meta sinful brand spread with the current build
[1:46:46] HaloS23: @Towelliee Would moving my main to Illidan be a good idea? current realm seems dead
[1:46:49] BoezIRL: @Towelliee will you go horde or ally in wrath?
[1:46:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: All those EU teams were pretty damned good
[1:47:01] Mecabeast: I saw some drama that it wasn't fair the keys on tourney realm were capped at 35
[1:47:09] Rottencoarse: i dont think jb's team was in it @Towelliee
[1:47:18] Ocenus: yeah
[1:47:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah
[1:47:22] Scoodles91: yes
[1:47:25] Autoexeq: Jdotb wasn't in TGP at all actually
[1:47:28] SLoPPYALieN: a simple version of barber shop
[1:47:28] ArcaneSyntax: it has the current retail barber
[1:47:39] SLoPPYALieN: oh snap... that's cool
[1:47:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I thought EU was just talking shit about how good their region is, but if you look at those 30+ keys that were run, they were the highest average
[1:47:57] Unkn0wn_csgo: Golly that gear lookin fresh
[1:48:12] amonthedead: and what i know barber shoppen  in lich king classic could i understand a we get the same thing from retail barber with the change from male to fenmale
[1:48:13] dewking93: is there barber shop in vanilla or bc?
[1:48:23] Febreze1212: i have a 18 junkyard

[1:48:55] ArcaneSyntax: yes you can change your characters gender in the barber shopin wrath classic.
[1:48:56] MerffTV: TGP is way more engaging than MDI too

[1:49:28] biirrd: This was EU
[1:49:33] Ocenus: @dewking93 no it was introduced in wotlk
[1:49:36] Unkn0wn_csgo: oh no clue mdi and the great push were different events damn.
[1:49:37] Banjo586: tgp has like 3 times the viewership of mdi if you combine twitch and YT
[1:49:46] SauceFu: TGP is much better from a spectator point of view. From a competitor, the MDI would be better since it involves less dungeons
[1:49:46] MrGharr: initial key levels were too low for these teams
[1:49:49] Mecabeast: tgp is also more relatable to live then the mdi
[1:49:52] Overhaul_1229: wanna do a 19 streets?
[1:49:56] Bernardo994: the great ppop
[1:49:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: There was plenty of cheese, with shadowmeld junk and using squirrels, but there was also so much talent shown in The Great Push
[1:50:01] Bernardo994: poop*
[1:50:11] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also jb's team is NA not EU fyi :D
[1:50:24] Ocenus: i thought this tgp was just the EU teams not NA yet
[1:50:31] jhopps12: WoW is hard to watch if you don't know what's going on
[1:50:34] JLmorten: Maby they say somthing about TGP VS MDI when thay have that Esport announce  this week
[1:50:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Poor AWC Pepehands
[1:50:39] Siddydiddydo: wow esports is super hard to follow for an average person, and super uninteresting unless you know how hard it is
[1:50:41] Rottencoarse: @Ocenus  NA was last week
[1:50:44] surpriseparty20: Every thing should come to Twitch and co streams should be allowed
[1:50:51] Mecabeast: it was like 20k or so twitch and youtube next week I think is eu vs na
[1:50:52] SauceFu: @Ocenus this was week 2. Next week I think is the finals with NA, EU and CN
[1:50:55] dimofodi: i forget what TGP had on YouTube but it was a fraction of what it had on Twitch since they can multi-stream TGP
[1:50:57] Sollice: Ok so Advanced GG Strawberry shortcake. I am not sure if I am going to like it regardless, but water or milk
[1:51:01] Ocenus: @Rottencoarse i was watching and thought isn't jpc missing here lol
[1:51:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: They said there is some big Esports announcement for WoW coming this week
[1:51:05] Bulgogiprince: watched the AWC finals. It's not fun watching a match that is just waiting for dampening as a win condition.

[1:51:11] Steelsky_: I preffer regular MDI than the TGP
[1:51:12] Autoexeq: I don't know. I gotta say I love both formats equally. You do have an element of MDI in TGP since you still need a fast time to have a tie-breaker so I understand what you're saying. It is exciting though to see a team be able to make it when it matters and not just re-try till you get it.
[1:51:23] GamingDad77: @Sollice Milkj 100%
[1:51:26] dimofodi: Your healer is ranged? :D
[1:51:29] Sollice: ok
[1:51:48] Sollice: Rent is too god damn high
[1:51:50] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[1:52:00] Banjo586: in my experience every hunter below +20 keys is bm and does tank damage
[1:52:20] MrGharr: they could combine TGP and MDI to a new format, where you push up key to the highest and then match 2 teams on those dungeons for time.
[1:52:29] Unkn0wn_csgo: @Zettabyte morin, damn 79 months OKAY!
[1:52:31] Autoexeq: @biirrd Oh, I didn't remember seeing him. I missed saturday. What team was he in?
[1:52:38] Neziko: Question regarding the Advanced . gg energy drink. Does it have a lot of the same things in it as Monster or Rock Star? Was curious about buying one, but monster/rock star kind of mess with my heart a little bit.
[1:52:49] Sollice: @Neziko no it doesnt
[1:52:49] MerffTV: i think the race format of MDI is borning
[1:52:52] MerffTV: boring
[1:53:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is a real reason why some specs are meta, they are able to outperform others, but the difference shouldn't be that big if they are all played well
[1:53:00] Sollice: If you go to their producr pages it will tell you exactly whats in it
[1:53:19] Neziko: @Sollice Okay sweet, thank you!
[1:53:26] MrMuffinPuffs: !server
[1:53:32] Sollice: @Neziko https://advanced.gg/pages/mtashed-mango-splash-ingredients
[1:53:45] Sollice: Thats for one of the best flavors MTashed Mango
[1:53:55] Naturalbeef: I really want to play some different specs and classes but can't justify spending the gold for legendaries
[1:53:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: And it is a little misleading if you count blood DK as "tank damage", it's broken
[1:54:07] Banjo586: and they were eliminated
[1:54:11] Banjo586: KEKW
[1:55:11] Mecabeast: a way they could adjust it is but a reservation/ban system in place on certain specs/classes to spice things up
[1:55:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: We did see one prot warrior in the Great Push, and one frost DK, and one resto druid, but the rest were meta specs
[1:55:50] Autoexeq: I don't understand. Don't all games have like a min-maxing thing? I don't get why people get upset when the Meta is centred around a couple of specs.
[1:56:09] SauceFu: We won't see the Wrath prepatch until tomorrow eh? Assuming it will replace BC and not be added to the list
[1:56:11] nintendyoh: Any news on dungeon finder being changed?
[1:56:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's both the uptime of dancing rune weapon, and their 4 set giving them 2 weapons that is crazy
[1:56:27] gunnar50o1: as a blood DK main i hate the DRW play it's so boring not deathstriking and doing huge hps
[1:56:35] Unkn0wn_csgo: yo if a rogue joined yall's group and they were sub- do yall kick or just run the key?
[1:56:45] Thoreya: sub isnt bad
[1:56:46] Thoreya: so no
[1:56:49] Siddydiddydo: meta forever it feels like
[1:56:59] Elric1976: @Towelliee what mod are you using for the float dmg numbers?
[1:56:59] schetefan91: meta or not if you can play your class / Specc right you will outshine for sure and that is just a minimal playerbase that can do it thats all
[1:56:59] llNoTToXiCll: @SauceFu  fresh servers means it would have a wrath thing wouldnt it tho
[1:57:00] snoopy123lol: or just make them more tanky lol
[1:57:01] llNoTToXiCll: ?
[1:57:03] AlphasaurusRexx: @Autoexeq we arent upset at it. it's just boring to watch the same specs doing everything. same thing why league is boring to watch, its always the same champs
[1:57:34] Unkn0wn_csgo: @Thoreya I like that, appreciate it
[1:58:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, true....this broken tier set has been holding them up...and there needs to be some adjustment if it's gone
[1:58:21] Banjo586: @AlphasaurusRexx ehm isn't league the most popular esport though? like obviously a lot of people enjoy it
[1:58:25] llNoTToXiCll: @AlphasaurusRexx  one can say that about Path of Exile also
[1:58:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot pallies are going to be hurting, yeah
[1:58:59] AlphasaurusRexx: @Banjo586 not as popular as it used to be. used to rake in 200k viewers on twitch and i barely see 100k lately
[1:59:10] Unkn0wn_csgo: @NoTToXiCLuL and now people are straight up quitting the league this update :/
[1:59:22] AlphasaurusRexx: @NoTToXiCLuL ive never played it so i couldnt weigh in on that
[1:59:24] Autoexeq: @AlphasaurusRexx Ok, so it happens in LoL also? Thanks for the answer :) Well I'm not. Sure I'd love to see a Warrior or a Shaman but that's what happens when you have the MDI or TGP to overcome. You have to play what is best in every situation. It's a big difference to do a +30 and a +22. It's taken to the extreme, that's all.
[1:59:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reducing that holy power means less heals that they were doing
[1:59:43] Siddydiddydo: pally paths in DF still feel a little wonky to me, there are so many points that feel mandatory

[1:59:51] NewWorldReign: have you been watching the mythic run races, who you vouching for?
[1:59:59] UltraKSlaya: Raioktv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 81 months! towHAMUP
[2:00:25] Autoexeq: @AlphasaurusRexx I would say AWC is much worse. It's SO discouraging seeing Rogue, Mage with whatever healer and the other comps hjave no shot at all.
[2:00:28] Siddydiddydo: seraphim always takes too many HP in first tier
[2:00:35] beestcik: !woltk
[2:00:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot paladin does needa  lot of haste for their typical holy power generation, yes
[2:00:45] Mecabeast: seraphim will be good late df when you have base 25-30% haste
[2:00:47] akia03: isnt that with all classes pick these or you suck
[2:00:54] AlphasaurusRexx: 160k overalll viewers is not what im talking about. im talking about lcs viewers.
[2:01:11] Redpandalol: @towelliee you think gear can fill in the slowing down of holy power generation?
[2:01:11] Unkn0wn_csgo: I was kinda in shock to see legion artifact skills on the trees
[2:01:22] AlphasaurusRexx: @Autoexeq nobody watches that anywyas xD\
[2:01:26] Wcvechten: yeah, changed it from haste to vers iirc
[2:01:28] Shatraugh: I wonder if Annihilator and Sidearm get any buffs for fury in DF
[2:01:41] Banjo586: @Autoexeq rogue and mage have been broken since the dawn of time in most of content, WoW CC and utility needs a complete redesign imo
[2:01:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember back in the start of Shadowlands, some people still picked blood DK as an S-tier spec because of its "agency", but it was such a pain in the ass and they were getting globalled often

[2:02:47] Autoexeq: @Towelliee The new talents looked good at the start of alpha but it's starting to get streamlined so hard that it's basically what we have now just you don't need to change Covenants. They had the biggest chance ever to get it right and I think they already sold themselves short. It's not enough.

[2:03:53] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: Morning Towel and Chat how goes it
[2:03:57] Autoexeq: @Banjo586 RMP have actually won Blizzcon only ONCE ever in all the years. So in the upper tier of esports it hasn't been that OP. But I hear what you're saying. RMP is what it is. It's just so bad when a comp like that does the most damage on top of already having the best CC
[2:03:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they should make shield of the righteous overlap, but that needs plenty of holy power
[2:04:04] Mecabeast: I could see prot pally tier having something like procd  avenger shield has a high chance of generating a holy power
[2:05:19] NewWorldReign: wow dumbed down a few things during DF Beta?
[2:05:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Block chance is alright, I think it makes sense to give it buffs, yeah
[2:05:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blocking spells can be badass
[2:05:54] Siddydiddydo: I almost feel like it's worth it to spec down the of dusk and dawn tree instead of the mad paragon tree, it'll give more mitigation
[2:05:56] Autoexeq: And also the talent trees. Why even have the first tier? Almost all classes pick everything in their spec tree on the first tier. Arms warrior not picking Mortal Strike? Really?
[2:06:27] Autoexeq: Just make it baseline and have some interesting choices instead

[2:07:37] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee You think Cross Faction dungeons could of been done earlier?
[2:07:50] Redpandalol: @towelliee do you know if there is any truth to the hunter dev working on Druid class/tree?
[2:07:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: It seems like a waste of points to me, to have people buy back baseline things, true
[2:08:00] MILESkg21: there must always be a meta KappaCool
[2:08:16] Rocman: the top of the tree is all about leveling up
[2:08:18] WarriorMuffins: wouldnt they have to give less points then?
[2:08:21] Mecabeast: I think its like that for now but 10yrs down thr line we may have more abilities added to the tree
[2:08:23] smashwow: pally seems to have a lot of that
[2:08:24] Rocman: not max level players
[2:08:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having brewmaster buying back stagger is just wasting a point
[2:08:25] Shatraugh: I fucking love fury warrior talents
[2:08:31] schetefan91: @Rocman * Lich King LUL
[2:08:42] ArcaneSyntax: I think we need to keep in mind that this is for new players too.
[2:08:43] Technogre: ahh the illusion of choice
[2:08:46] Autoexeq: Yeah, it's like "you have 30 talents", but the first 10 is just filler to get whatever. it's tier 2 and 3 which is interesting. And they have such potential to make it good even on the first tier.
[2:08:50] Thoreya: mage tree is better now
[2:08:53] SpoofAvatar: my feedback - heartstrike should 1 shot all raid bosses

[2:11:03] Wcvechten: yeah, now it's vers
[2:11:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't like stacking things for death and decay because its uptime is janky, but they do need to make sure the spec has enough haste
[2:11:55] NecromedesDK: Unholy for life
[2:11:57] NecromedesDK: <3
[2:12:07] fewyn: i have no idea what i want to play in DF

[2:12:28] Xynth25: Unholy's opener is 27 globals long and you don't start dumping RP for Gargoyle amp until more than 20s in
[2:12:30] fewyn: i've played DK and Warrior the last few years i feel like it's time for a change
[2:12:34] MILESkg21: it will be interesting to see DW frost tanks again LuL
[2:12:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Getting a second charge of death and decay is great, but Death's Echo is way the hell down the tree (too far down imo)
[2:12:42] Autoexeq: It's gonna be the same as all expansions. DK's will be starved of haste and not enough self-healing to sustain. Warrior, DH and Pala will be great first patch. Monk is gonne be meh till 10.1 then they will soar, along with Pala. DK is going to start become viable in 10.1.5 and then god-tier in 10.2 onwards
[2:13:16] saltyohm: chances are on downfall lol
[2:13:21] Xynth25: @autoexeq Prot War actually looks cracked this xpac. They're getting *a lot*

[2:13:47] Autoexeq: @schetefan91 Did I...or did Blizzard KEKW

[2:14:18] MILESkg21: Priests are the new FERAL KEKW
[2:14:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Poor ferals Pepehands

[2:19:48] Steelsky_: I think the statue should've been some sort of utility, not raw damage
[2:19:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rising sun kick is a good addition

[2:21:15] skymercii: @wEiRdO_dUdE thats how they do the fistweaving thing is with the rising sunkick
[2:21:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: The offense for mistweaver has not been as good as its looking for DF
[2:21:17] Steelsky_: the druid class tree needs a rework for sure, compared to others is so limited

[2:31:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Unlike with Classic Wrath, there isn't really a number for the amount of gold you need in Dragonflight, but if you can save up say 100K it will make things smoother

[2:42:33] Mecabeast: just wait till twitch starts doing like 5min ads per hour on non-affilates and twitch takes all the money
[2:42:34] Rabbi19: That’s why I went to turbo. Tired of the ads.
[2:42:37] LosDuervo: that's pretty decent
[2:42:37] Llamatude: and affiliate gets shit for them and forced to run them..
[2:42:40] Brodih_: i hate it, but i use that time to take a shit or do a quick shore
[2:42:40] Reckless_Monk: cant be mad at a streamer for getting his money

[2:42:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: One of the other popular streamers I watch said his ad revenue is #2 right after gifted subs, yeah it's big
[2:42:56] Jango_: @paragon_3 thats what turbo is for
[2:42:59] Rabbi19: Sadly also means I canceled subs to afford turbo.
[2:43:23] Llamatude: same i watch SOOO many streamers that i had to go turbo the ads got crazy
[2:43:48] paragon_3: @Jango_ yeah but I don't care about what all the other crap prime offers so the extra cost isn't worth it to me
[2:43:52] Demvacco: turbo is the best decision I ever made
[2:43:56] kay0234: I don't think affiliates get that much either

[2:44:32] xluckydawgx: bout ad revenue
[2:44:32] Jango_: I used to be able to run 2 adblocks, and then they broke that, forcing me into turbo
[2:44:34] Tamz_tv: twitch turbo is bis
[2:44:45] Mecabeast: also heard more ad rev if your avg watch age is older
[2:44:49] r0b928: What’s twitch turbo?
[2:44:56] Alienfromger: ppl bying turbo instead of subs means twitch gets more money and streamer less

[3:14:37] KyleEverett: Based on conversations Veng people have had with Realz I wouldn't be shocked to see Fiery Soul and Raz legendaries as talents and they work off souls consumed rather than just Soul Cleave casts.

[3:19:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't seen the vengeance numbers lately, I don't know
[3:19:29] KyleEverett: @ventu105 supposedly you only need a 55 on the Fresh realms to make a dk, old realms they don't care.

[3:25:13] SpyCrabbo: adventure modes is basically doing world quests
[3:25:15] koko316: Rifts are the way to go
[3:25:17] Vyntage1: !WOTLK

[3:25:50] JackedDown: KEKW the slowest way possible
[3:25:58] LearnedSomething: or just join a group with someone who's ahead and get max level and few paragons in minutes
[3:26:04] thatguynamedbrandon: do the seasonal challenge. dont open until you have the cube. make a level 1. open the container from challenge rifts. THen use those materials to roll a wep or piece of gear for the cube that makes leveling broken
[3:26:06] GamingDad77: casual D3 player....lol
[3:26:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: i almost bought d3 again but just gonna wait until 4

[3:26:38] Crimzoned: whats your thoughts on df in general?
[3:26:40] LearnedSomething: it's fine to run it to leoric for the xp helm
[3:26:52] cynical_effect12: Crusader leveling is so damn slow
[3:26:57] gritbarontv: did you completed the campaign at least one otherwise adventure mode is locked, last a remember.
[3:27:04] MrKray2: you talking D3?
[3:27:16] Malarick: Necro becomes unkillable once you have corpse explosion
[3:27:19] MrKray2: sorry i am late, was moving house
[3:27:20] ContraRob: @gritbarontv They actually just changed that to unlock adventure mode for everyone
[3:27:21] AmZambie: Maxroll and Icyveins have some good leveling builds and endgame builds
[3:27:36] BoezIRL: @MrKray2 yes

[3:35:14] Galadeon: Yes
[3:35:15] procyon_mfc: It's about forging of the 9 rings
[3:35:15] Masqerader: Its around the Isuldir time
[3:35:18] im_n0t_jezus: i think they just get to tell the stories they talk about in LOTR but not the actual silmarilion
[3:35:19] Broomba: The Simarillion is the backstory and history of the Middle Earth before hobbit and LOTR
[3:35:23] grufmuf: its the Silmarillion @Towelliee
[3:35:35] DrWraithjr: LUL people just like to be angry about stuff
[3:35:41] Texas_Mizfit: are you watching house of the dragon

[3:36:56] Galadeon: Middle Earth is flat at the start of the show.  It will be round by the end.  You will learn how all that happens and how the rings are made.
[3:37:14] BionicMagician: have you watched the sandman series @Towelliee?
[3:37:30] Broomba: like 14 or 15 books in the series @towelliee

[3:37:36] CritcobainTV: Sandman is fuckin great
[3:37:38] dewking93: If I have never seen lord of the rings will I be able to watch this new show ?

[3:44:04] Broomba: Any mod in channel can check to see if my entry was accepted on discorded for the giveaway please?
[3:44:04] 91Niki: @wEiRdO_dUdE They are usually pretty good on discord, because people are too lazy to enter

[3:47:23] PatchesMcPatch: @Alepouditsa You need to have a level 60 on your account to be able to make a DK i believe, so yes?  Or is that server based. correct me if im wrong anyone
[3:47:52] inpaynettv: !fresh
[3:48:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: With Classic Wrath it's a little different this time, I think anyone can make a DK on a regular realm
[3:49:09] Pesky_Ninja: Yeah if im not wrong you can just make a DK with no requirements
[3:49:13] lucid_wow: @wEiRdO_dUdE i think what they said is for first DK anyone can make it but only 1 per server and to make one on another server the lvl restriction is still in
[3:49:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The fresh servers will be limited to only people who get to 55 or whatever first, and you can only do that "free" DK once
[3:49:20] Biorrwolf: Everyone on current realms can make one DK per realm with no requirements
[3:49:38] Biorrwolf: Fresh realms. however, will require a Lv55 character
[3:49:41] Attackroot: Anyone on reg server can make it, but have to do the lvl process on fresh server to get a dk on fresh
[3:49:43] Alepouditsa: @patchesmcpatch i have a lvl 70 hunter, but i am not sure if i can make a DK on the new server without making a lvl 60
[3:49:44] wetfinger: is this giveaway EU too? i just tuned in

[3:50:22] Biorrwolf: Addendum: First DK on current servers is free. All others will require a 55

[5:20:33] ItsDerpDiggler: I'd be PvP'ing all day again lol
[5:20:35] charlie_the_snowman: Nah
[5:20:42] bagrain: I would totally play it
[5:20:42] Nokterian: ncsoft indeed killed it
[5:20:43] 91Niki: If Wildstar got toned down in hardcoreness, YES I would absolutely fucking play
[5:20:50] ItsDerpDiggler: I played until the day it shut down
[5:20:51] spookychefkarolina: YES. Yes I would play it. Jeez.
[5:20:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe it, the game looks alright

[5:20:53] bagrain: I miss my tank warrior
[5:20:56] Jarlan23: it would be more sucessful than a lot of other mmos out today
[5:20:56] charlie_the_snowman: I have found my game now. It played it 20 hours every day when it came out though
[5:20:57] Murlock07: Too Hardcore

[5:21:05] mmrghost7: what time does fresh server open for prepatch ?
[5:21:06] sv_adhara: yes, and at some point, the game was too hard for the commun player
[5:21:10] CorwenTTV: they pushed it out too early and then killed it with F2P
[5:21:14] txrb: would be a good re-release
[5:21:14] GingerPurple: I would play it and i never played it back in the day. first time seeing gameplay is this video and i'm intrested

[5:21:28] ZeroCold55: tried it 2 times - couldnt get into it.
[5:21:29] Hyelander_: The only game thats connected to NC Soft and still exists is Guild Wars 2. NC Soft is a garbage publisher that kills anything it touches
[5:21:36] Jeanssi: Datascape was such a good raid, I still remember when we killed System Daemons for the 1st time
[5:21:37] LyteKrame: what game is this. this looks cool
[5:21:39] xluckydawgx: Yeah thats the issue
[5:21:40] spinningballearth: Outer space is fake, you can’t have gas pressure without a container. If the sky was a vacuum the gas we breathe would fill the vacuum
[5:21:52] kalamari__: @LyteKrame this was wildstar.
[5:21:53] Electafuzz: yeah, the nexus forever guys are keeping expectations real low for the private server

[5:26:01] falldrgn: Aion?
[5:26:03] Nokterian: they still dont give love to GW2
[5:26:03] ShadowDMG6969: It's because their Eastern ones make more money all the way thru
[5:26:05] ItsDerpDiggler: I'm putting a lot of faith in AoC cuz.... I'm tired of not having an MMORPG that I can get into like I used to... I can't do FFXIV... I don't like all the MASSIVE dialogue before every quest lol

[5:26:32] Hyelander_: @Nokterian GW2 is alive because of ArenaNet
[5:26:37] BullTerrorist: How big was the Star Wars mmo?
[5:26:38] Mecabeast: imagine wod killing a game now that we know what it was like
[5:26:40] charlie_the_snowman: Wasn’t AION the pioneer or paying for loot boxes ? 📦
[5:26:44] ItsDerpDiggler: I'm really contemplating coming back to WoW for Dragonflight though
[5:26:45] charlie_the_snowman: For*
[5:26:50] skaaldi: it's fine it was just WoD
[5:26:54] GingerPurple: Arenanet is only reason GW2 is still kicking and a good game right now
[5:26:57] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[5:26:57] Mattsta: there was someone in my guild that was in the friends and family alpha onward for wildstar...from the way he talked about it, sounded like wildstar was a trainwreck from the get go
[5:26:59] jipsplade: What i would want back is Warhammer online SMOrc
[5:27:07] UltraKSlaya: WoD was rushed to compete with Wildstar
[5:27:11] marcelthagoat: the leveling was bad
[5:27:13] Nokterian: yes it is alive and well but ncsoft still not doing big on advertisement for GW2
[5:27:17] Frolul: !FRESH
[5:27:19] Bernardo994: yea i didnt see much advertising when it dropped
[5:27:21] dschmidt: @jipsplade 100%
[5:27:23] ItsDerpDiggler: @jipsplade The Warhammer Online private server is VERY active
[5:27:23] Attackroot: I competed 2 of the 3 raids the Legion launched and I went back to wow
[5:27:27] MindhackerTV: wow never needed to compete with wildstar...
[5:27:29] nesman27: i remember doing all the attunement quests on wildstar then never running the raid lol
[5:27:31] Cower311: advertising was a real problem i feel like. if they put wildstar on every platform like steam and shit it prolly wouldve got more players
[5:27:35] 91Niki: Yikes
[5:27:35] raldrik: I still miss Ascherons call. MMO with monthly update that advanced the storyline. That was the best
[5:27:39] smol_gunner: speaking of WoD, since you played the aplha, how does it compare to DF alpha (dragonriding excluded)?
[5:27:39] Tecni: advertising was so bad... had no idea that the game had changed
[5:27:43] Bernardo994: floppers
[5:27:58] Bernardo994: it was right i its time

[5:28:14] jipsplade: @jipsplade i tried it a couple of times but it felt empty i dont know
[5:28:17] delaine: but their kids are gonna love it
[5:28:21] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Rift was ahead of its time too, both with positives and negatives
[5:28:21] MindhackerTV: and the thelegraphs killed it xD
[5:28:22] xluckydawgx: Age of Conan wow, forgot about that one
[5:28:26] UltraKSlaya: of all the games to take over from WoW, Wildstar should have been it
[5:28:27] Frolul: !Fresh
[5:28:28] Attackroot: It was. Going for gold dungeons was fun as hell with difficulty I liked
[5:28:34] spookychefkarolina: Hell no. I remember the WOW Ozzy Osborne commercials. It’s when I started playing.
[5:28:40] ShadowDMG6969: Western Gamer Demigraphics aren't as willing to spend huge amounts per Population for basic things and doing Loot Boxes. If we had more people like you & some of the other WoW streamers things might be different
[5:28:47] ItsDerpDiggler: @jipsplade You have to get to the higher levels because everyone is out of the lower level areas lol It does feel like that in the starter areas for sure
[5:28:48] Frolul: !WOTLK
[5:28:48] Moobot: @Frolul I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[5:28:48] BigBusiness: I quit when the raid attunements were so hard. The hardmode dungeons were tough for pugs
[5:28:53] Attackroot: Legion was after free to play
[5:28:55] marcelthagoat: it took them too long to fix things too, the endgame also had too many barriers to entry that prevented most ppl from even getting there
[5:28:59] Attackroot: But close
[5:29:15] Skkold: if they re-released WildStar last year during Shadowlands people would get back very quickly
[5:29:16] charlie_the_snowman: Y
[5:29:17] MindhackerTV: wildstar thelegraph sucked.. and raids were wierd....
[5:29:19] spookychefkarolina: Word of mouth towCopium
[5:29:23] UltraKSlaya: launch on steam too
[5:29:30] jipsplade: @jipsplade maybe i have to give it another shot :D
[5:29:31] Hyelander_: If Wildstar came out today, it would get all the Final Fantasy people switch
[5:29:32] Skkold: part of the issue I think is that they had too few dungeons, hardcore raids, slow leveling, all problems that wow had moved away from, they chose to stick to the "classic" feeling
[5:29:40] Murlock07: @BigBusiness I gave up on the attunements God it was a mess for me at least
[5:29:46] Mattsta: I'd agree...wildstar came out on like the tail end of the mmo bubble...would totally succeed in this like mmo draught we are in now
[5:29:58] SpookyJamez: (hardcore)
[5:29:58] XshadowturkeyX: back then i ddint really have the money to pay for subs like wow or ff14 or wildstar now i do and can support , thats the diffrence i think more people can support now than back then
[5:30:09] Leeroypaxton: wildstar was fun, but the dungeons and raid were stupid overtuned and hard, at least at launch they were
[5:30:10] charlie_the_snowman: Nah, the ff14 has some pretty dedicated pply
[5:30:25] charlie_the_snowman: They put too much time into their characters already
[5:30:42] kalamari__: AoE has no box price though, no?
[5:30:54] kalamari__: *AoC
[5:30:55] oneifbyland: lmao wat
[5:31:09] Hippwn: I have a feeling ashes is going to flop
[5:31:12] Rowini30: oh god
[5:31:15] Alaquane: pkmnEyes
[5:31:27] Tecni: were Wildstar the first with paying for game time with in game currency?
[5:31:29] charlie_the_snowman: @ryutta me too, but I don’t wanna say it
[5:31:34] Revoca: it sounds like a pyramid scheme
[5:31:35] Attackroot: Any cult following streamer lol
[5:31:38] abracka_: they're gonna have to stop that real quick
[5:31:40] Paddleson: asmon doesnt really shill referral codes lol

[5:33:45] possibly_dave: @rohim depends on the content you enjoy, but it seems as though they are making it more casual friendly and not having the competitive endgame to be the only thing to do
[5:33:49] Frolul: Excited for fresh tomorrow ? @towelliee
[5:33:55] Shaele: there ARE private servers already tho
[5:34:05] bwoods79: I've been playing palia alpha, can't wait to see the final product of it
[5:34:13] 91Niki: People underestimate the complexity of putting a game onto public servers. It isn't just a copy paste scenario
[5:34:14] actionbill: skipped TBC classic entirely, told myself I wouldn't play WotLK either. now we're 1 day from fresh and I'm pre-addicted NotLikeThis
[5:34:20] Breakadinn: Fresh servers still only PvP?
[5:34:20] Mecabeast: I hope there's something like visions so solo players can get to mythic raid equivalent ilvl
[5:34:23] Tecni: @Shaele yeha but you can't do much on them

[5:35:01] Shaele: @Tecni What are you on about? It worked fine for me...
[5:35:14] charlie_the_snowman: Fo sheezy mah neezy
[5:35:20] Tecni: @Shaele Are you talking about Wildstar or something else?
[5:35:26] Skkold: some people are complaining about DF world content end game, it's too similar to Legion/BFA/Shadowlands (world quests). Not sure what people expects though.
[5:35:33] Angsterz: did they do anything new for feral?
[5:35:36] Jeanssi: it's supposed to have on use, but nothing atm
[5:35:49] Shaele: Wildstar. After LP's video about it, I checked it as well and was playing it all day today without any problems
[5:35:52] TriumphantToad: Ohhhh gotcha
[5:35:52] 91Niki: @Attackroot Yeah, people don't understand when people put new stuff on the alpha and go "wHy aRe tHeY reLeAsInG bRoKeN cOnteNt? BabyRage ". People don't understand the progress of moving stuff from internal to public LUL
[5:36:33] Breakadinn: Breakadinn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Hey Towellie, dang almost 2 years subbed. Are fresh servers still PVP only?
[5:37:02] actionbill: @breakadinn nah there's a PVE one too

[5:37:22] ThQbi: Bless you
[5:37:30] Tecni: @Shaele Yeah but you can't do much in it. You can't lvl to max, dungeons, raids, pvp and more. That was the point right?
[5:37:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fresh servers will have one PvP and one PvE server at the start, in both NA and EU
[5:37:36] Molvonos: Prolly hi-res/low-res versions like the warpstalker
[5:37:38] Breakadinn: @actionbill they announce that recently? was gone all weekend
[5:37:44] Masqerader: both?

[5:39:21] xanarel22: devs: "Wait, it launches WHEN?"
[5:39:24] xhaven: I feel like alot of the devs are on DF and wrath took a backseat
[5:39:26] Aspectt10: @Towelliee  Bobby needs his fourth yacht
[5:39:41] draxss: yeah bc dev team told us everything months b4 bc came out
[5:40:04] Tecni: @Shaele yeah that was the thing he meant it will take a few years for them to bring the servers up with the content the game had befroe it shut down
[5:40:14] infinityarty: i feel like this is gonna happen alot, i made it i made it i made it.. nope i did not
[5:40:32] Revoca: They should have the flight paths do some crazy unrealistic dragon flying instead of normal flying

[7:08:13] Epiclurker27893: If they didn't save the Longbottoms then they don't get to rez Dumbledoore
[7:08:14] Armdel: this isnt some time gated crap
[7:08:15] WalrusPug: well, basically you "open a new game"
[7:08:15] mackieeswe: you can farm 24/7
[7:08:18] WalrusPug: yes, intentional

[7:08:25] Malarick: sucks when you are o
[7:08:25] Masqerader: always been like that
[7:08:26] cahoots82: That's the game. Bounties have some key items for builds and let you farm mats.
[7:08:27] Dakhran: no cap, just infinite grind
[7:08:29] rymerre: you need a shit load of the mats
[7:08:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's a feature, not a bug LUL
[7:08:34] LunaKura: Intentional. It's reset because you're making a new "instance"
[7:08:35] Broomba: @towelliee that mango adv gg flavor is soooo freaking done, not too strong or weak just right

[7:08:45] Armdel: this game lets you grind until your eyes fall out if you want to
[7:08:49] cahoots82: D3 is grind to grind so you can grand more.
[7:08:57] Howyoubinh: wait first time playing D3? no way
[7:08:59] rymerre: if it was diablo immortal it would be 1 per day or pay 25 to reset
[7:09:00] kiljoy102: fuck man the fact that is shocking says a ton about modern games
[7:09:03] Baldarsar: @Towelliee  go on map and press right klick mouse you see 5 acts with each 5 bountys , so thats 25 if you do all
[7:09:37] jpwastaken_: Are you gonna check out maxroll for the build ur going at 70?

[7:12:22] rymerre: this season has special powers
[7:12:26] Nightshadre: augmentation of items
[7:12:37] cahoots82: borrowed power
[7:12:42] Varkarus: I was heavily considering coming back to D3 after about a year break. Almost forget everything honestly. Anyone in chat say it's worth it? I'm looking for a power fantasy game that isn't as complex (or time commitment) as POE
[7:12:43] jpwastaken_: You have these things called ANGELIC CRUCIBLES, so you can reroll items to have SPECIAL bonuses it's like a wow legendary. you can wear 1 at a time and they have special augments (and the items have perfect stat roll like primal legendaries)
[7:12:50] Ordicos: get an item that turns weapons in powerful items like having angels follow you
[7:12:52] cahoots82: Like uh, corruptions in 8.3
[7:13:07] cahoots82: but class specific
[7:13:40] BTiZZY_: !fresh
[7:13:42] Epiclurker27893: angelic crucible giving you a torghast style power
[7:13:54] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Do you think they should of waited on releasing wrath till maybe next year after DF hype mellows?
[7:13:57] LunaKura: @Towelliee It looks like you could sacrifice some Toughness for damage. You're taking no damage, but your damage is low.
[7:14:14] BTiZZY_: @TombStoneMercenary theres no way people would have nothing to do on classic for forever
[7:14:22] rymerre: dont feel you need to pay attention to your damage numbers...they are arbitrary
[7:14:24] Masqerader: yup
[7:14:25] abracka_: is hand of rag in d3 now?
[7:14:49] abracka_: that's hilarious and awesome

[7:18:45] rymerre: while leveling nothing matters

[7:22:04] Getroneus: Give it time LuL
[7:22:12] GamingDad77: need to upgrade the difficulty then
[7:22:13] sainstrife: Doing Bounties sub lvl 70 is kinda pointless
[7:22:36] cahoots82: turn that difficulty up

[7:22:44] Getroneus: Balancing difficulty with clear speed is the name of the name pre-70. Well, post 70 too actually
