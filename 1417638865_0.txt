[0:54:52] sydneystraya: it all depends. you can get cheap land in the country like 6 hours away from the city or major areas. but in the suburbs like 1 hour from the city, house prices range from 800k - 1.2 million. that's for a 400sqm 3 bedroom home

[3:27:08] Rexialiton: just checked
[3:27:20] jonathan012f: what do you think about the stage of WoW then?
[3:27:51] jonathan012f: my bad
[3:27:55] Rexialiton: The Frezzing Trap: "[Freezing Trap] - A trap that freezes the first enemy that approaches, preventing all action for a 1 Minute (8 seconds in PvP). Any damage caused will break the ice."
[3:28:05] saltyapple: It will be RIDICOLOUS with double leg and tier :D
[3:28:21] swoozyliveshere: what kind of rogue? all rogues?
[3:28:26] 수줍은: Imagine rogue with 2 legendary items LUL
[3:28:30] 7thSaga: hunters can do crazy dmg
[3:28:34] ratchet_ho_: warriors are super op rn
[3:28:39] Geartrix: the trinkets are op now until people get more hp since they are fully upgraded already
[3:28:59] saltyapple: My main has both crap covenant legendary and tier set. so sad :D
[3:29:19] DesiHeat: hi swifty fuegoH
[3:29:36] ratchet_ho_: hunter, warrior and mages are good rn
[3:29:50] 수줍은: @Swifty why did quit playing warrior in retail ?
[3:30:03] ratchet_ho_: and feral
[3:30:07] 7thSaga: Blizzard the nerfer

[3:30:43] swoozyliveshere: :P
[3:30:48] membaberry_: honor gear is last season duelist gear. its the time to get back on track
[3:30:51] saltyapple: @ratchet_ho_ Feral is great now until everyone gets double leggy and tier.. ferals (necro) cov leggy and tier set is trash compared to others

[3:31:29] fadum22: saludame*
[3:31:31] 7thSaga: ironmouseWiggly
[3:31:40] Darlix_garduni: thats actually why most people who quit early on never came back for the patch i feel like, at least that surely a big reason why

[3:32:42] Treesy__: If you were less geared he would of killed you
[3:33:02] fadum22: grande asuhka!
[3:33:09] membaberry_: solo shuffle, 1k honor per game. and its item level balanced. so you only vs people within your item level
[3:33:10] Geartrix: you start at 226 in bgs with anima gear
[3:33:17] zCranberryx: hi swifty you're very handsome today love u from Ukraine
[3:33:22] Geartrix: and im done on warrior already so idk under a week
[3:33:29] saltyapple: I just go into a masochistic mindset when I gear up a new character. I put on a great show on netflix and then i just push autorun in bgs basically ;D
[3:33:32] Fullthrotle: i mean that will happen every expansion, are you saying you wont play the warrior or another class until the next expansion where everyone starts from scratch?
[3:34:25] Rexialiton: @zCranberryx God bless Ukraine <3
[3:34:31] saltyapple: IF the nerf to defstance proves too much they will probably revert it or compensate. they are very responsive this season it seems
[3:34:46] tankatrono_o: yeah i agree the burst windows are too big at the moment, There should be heavy hitting abilities you can time well, but with the advanced macros, legendaries, trinkets and all can be used within a second its too much, fun but not fair,
[3:35:06] fadum22: asuhka manco
[3:35:10] fadum22: grande
[3:35:13] Ruinkey: burst has to do dmg first though

[3:37:23] AbrigoDeAnimais: following u since 2009, a hug from brazil <3
[3:37:27] Cynergi_: so a bunch of questing?
[3:38:06] Oneofakind2525: Swift do you still hit the gym?
[3:38:09] panzerzz: you are playing sv hunter as a straight forward warrior playstyle. This is not the most effective as sv. The sv playstyle is pretty much a "fake melee", you need to use abilities like chakram, flanking strike, ventyr lego etc
[3:38:11] 수줍은: Even on my resto shaman when i use all my defesive cd that give me 90k hp its soo hard too survive burst and with double legendary its gonna be a nightmare for healer xqcHands
[3:38:23] Rexialiton: you trapped for 8 sec

[3:39:06] Rexialiton: he used trinket at 7 sec
[3:39:11] Geartrix: my first swifty vid was a prot warrior arathi basin in Wotlk
[3:39:11] EliBourne: 9.2 is actually pretty good all around
[3:39:21] Cynergi_: I havent played since s1 also, playing lost ark but bored of grinding and feel like i should just grind wow as i enjoyed that more. But id wanna come back and start fresh on my DH as they seem pretty nuts right now. But i didnt get any season 1 gear on him at all for pvp
[3:39:22] ripcryus: are you blind? whats with the big buttons? lolol

[3:41:57] Cynergi_: is there a lot of people in LFG for lower arenas to gear up a new toon with still??
[3:42:32] RegalColaShakenNotStirred: start of the season CR isn't that high right now
[3:43:29] Cynergi_: in LFG looking for teams is there say 40+ still people looking? was around that when I quit , seems like less people are on now. Still a lot of people in lfg  making groups is my question really
[3:43:41] Cynergi_: atleas t for horde
[3:44:14] Cynergi_: Ya sorry sorta a confusing question lol
[3:44:25] Geartrix: if you dont have a covenant quest line done thats the worst part
[3:44:27] Geartrix: takes hours
[3:45:01] magicmanxo: Shuffle is insta for healers
[3:45:02] Cynergi_: i just remember looking forever for someone to play with s1 in lfg... dont wanna come bak and be waiting for hours to find someone to queue with
[3:45:14] Treesy__: Towards the end of an expansion player numbers awlays drop
[3:45:30] Cynergi_: I even rerolled most of my classes to heal because of that
[3:45:32] RegalColaShakenNotStirred: no reason to do "soloqueue" its just skirmish with shiny rims, no ranked, no rewards just skirms with a new name
[3:45:39] Boltxb: Hyped for weekly vault on reset? :D
[3:46:02] myStylez: well it's flawed right because no MMR so good players don't wanna have to play with potatos
[3:46:12] Grullander: @Swifty what you think of the viability of BM hunter in 2's now?

[3:46:52] udokoch: nice flair at end
[3:46:53] RegalColaShakenNotStirred: @ItsShomy what title?
[3:47:10] magicmanxo: @Grullander BM is very strong
[3:47:11] Grullander: oh? there is a spec with a bunch of pets...lol
[3:47:16] Cynergi_: Loved legion SV hunter
[3:47:27] Grullander: I'm going to have to go back to learning.
[3:47:36] RegalColaShakenNotStirred: oh yeah doesn't really mean anything to me literally anyone can get 150 wins pretty meaningless title
[3:47:46] Grullander: @magicmanxo how so I'm fining I'm pretty weak...
[3:47:50] WickdGamr: I really hope there is a new class next expansion. if there isn't I think I'll probably step away from wow.
[3:47:58] Grullander: finding*
[3:48:01] Configer: ive gotta be up for work in 6 hours to do a full stock count , and you're keeping me up watching this !

[3:48:55] Cynergi_: this DH just uses his cc for no reason , srtilll blows you up tho haha
[3:49:28] panzerzz: if they put some more interesting rewards on solo shuffle, ppl will enjoy more.
[3:49:43] seanrp91: I always go heals against DH comps much easier as Surv to root him bacj
[3:49:52] panzerzz: this actual rewards are just trash

[7:53:04] Decaou: honestly man, fury warriors aren't as good as arms in 2s because things are dying so quickly in 2s that you can't even play; like for real because the dmg is untankable
[7:53:19] gooselebowski: @CodesMahoney once you hit 50 and complete Ealyn's Gift you get it
[7:53:24] tuhtonka: next xpac could be a while. id play the new patch!
[7:53:24] gooselebowski: @CodesMahoney Just double checked for us
[7:54:04] spartaprimez: Thanks for the advice yall. I miss the way Ret played between cata and wow.  Ret feels powerful but super slow lately
[7:54:18] gooselebowski: @JuiceBoxDrizzle I was curious about that class I'm playing paladin atm
[7:54:23] Decaou: D stance is uselss now
[7:54:48] gt_dynamarik: stat priority for arms warrior?
[7:55:00] Decaou: it would have been useless anyway because the removal of the 40% versa is making things die so quickly now
[7:55:11] Decaou: im not even sure why im gemming for versa anymore
[7:55:19] Decaou: because primary stat is strength

[11:42:39] JeffersonSovereign: good im not single Venthyr warrior in planet
[11:43:00] Googamus: But the PvP weps for 2 handers are soooo expensive
[11:43:10] JeffersonSovereign: i like it vs hunters
[11:43:11] Talason: swifty what happened to your prot paladin?
[11:43:14] JeffersonSovereign: never run away
[11:43:15] Crumpdiddy: This reminded me of the 2h vs dw frost dk debate
