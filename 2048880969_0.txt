[0:24:43] xzayvionx: GDKP is BIS for making gold for tokens in classic lol
[0:24:49] kenzjzo: where i,m gonna bury my gold if theres no GDKP
[0:25:08] kontcuk: yo whatsup
[0:25:22] kontcuk: good riddance
[0:25:44] xzayvionx: You don't have to compete with the gold buyers if you're just there to make gold. Just have to drive up the prices and let the idiot gold buyers spend way to much.
[0:26:02] kontcuk: the harder they make spending gold, the harder they increase the entry barrier to those runs, it's better for the health
[0:26:04] ophyce: Any serious gdkp player i raided with got at least 6 char per week they all sell gold like 2K euro + a month
[0:26:09] kontcuk: i don't want consumables to be 5g each
[0:26:11] assrug: if you run them enough you become just as wealthy as the gold buyers (since you soak their gold)
[0:26:31] Secrifal: gdkp is my side-side hustle :(
[0:27:48] assrug: inside trading
[0:28:03] assrug: nah
[0:28:31] ophyce: You look at TOC and ICC now both raid are cleared under 2h by "regular player" , it's not very time consuming to get 6 char + to run each week gdkp
[0:28:43] kontcuk: https://i.redd.it/looks-like-peacbloom-dkp-is-back-on-the-menu-v0-i54hxbltkjfc1.png?s=3322d1ff9aebb7ba073addcc940cdadf1be7f1a0
[0:28:46] assrug: inside trading would be like if you bought echo stocks because you know that you have crazy tech for next tier
[0:28:46] kontcuk: did you see this
[0:29:41] xzayvionx: lol todays headlines "Blizz kills SoD by banning GDKP".
[0:29:52] xzayvionx: jk
[0:29:59] ophyce: On my french realm , we had a group of 4-5 officer disbanding a guild just to build a gdkp one and sell gold a week later LUL
[0:30:50] kontcuk: also tbh as someone who routinely uses lfg for raids, gdkps fuck the shit out of the chat
[0:30:58] kontcuk: literally gdkp spam 24/7
[0:31:36] assrug: i call bs you would need an insane amount of characters to make enough gold from 1 reset
[0:31:39] xzayvionx: I mean if you're trying to discourage botting then banning GDKP is a decent step
[0:31:55] assrug: gdkp is kind of rmt
[0:32:00] assrug: in alot of cases
[0:32:19] xzayvionx: GDKP just promotes buying gold.
[0:32:22] xzayvionx: Oh yea for sure
[0:32:30] kenzjzo: theres always to way, no problems
[0:32:52] TheMysticBean: Dont see how they could ever enforce this, wouldnt it just be done on discord now?
[0:32:59] assrug: yeah but with gdkp they don't even need to be creative since it's completely up to the discretion of the gold buyer / seller if it's direct rmt there needs to be alot more communication with regards to the terms
[0:33:04] kontcuk: also man if raid isn't paying you big bucks, go fight them
[0:33:22] kontcuk: i swear to god i'm spiraling downwards
[0:33:31] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[0:33:45] kontcuk: i spent like 7k last week and only got 1 legendary
[0:33:50] kontcuk: these rates are horrible lmao
[0:34:18] self_lesss: gdkp is shortcut of what? Im new to wow..
[0:34:26] kenzjzo: @kontcuk euros?
[0:34:27] xzayvionx: Instead of doing GDKP we're just going to do group donation runs. Who ever in the group donates the most gets the item and then we share the donation :P lol
[0:34:37] kontcuk: raid shadow legends
[0:35:11] Kimolainen: maaan UI saw you dpsing yesterday, Scripe be pumping top mage haha <3 loved it
[0:35:12] kontcuk: yeah tl, not that insane yet lol
[0:35:14] assrug: self_lesss gold dragon kill points, it means that you buy items for gold, the gold goes into a pot and is divided among the raiders at the end of the raid (organizer usually takes a big cut)
[0:35:15] Kithe__: no refunds 4Head
[0:35:45] kontcuk: its like 250€ or something i think
[0:35:48] xzayvionx: Man screw those kind of games. There shouldn't be games like that and diablo immortal that you can sink 10s of thousands of dollars into.
[0:35:54] kontcuk: but 250€for one legendary is still a robbery
[0:35:56] kontcuk: for a mobile game
[0:36:23] Kimolainen: I mean im fine with it I buy a token a month in wow too lazy to do dailies or profs
[0:36:44] kontcuk: god bless making money out of games, i survived college selling wow boosts
[0:36:46] el___ninja: what are your thoughts on Nnogie going back to Method?
[0:36:49] kenzjzo: man ive spent thousands euros oer years into candy crush
[0:37:24] xzayvionx: I just feel like games like that prey on people with addictive personalities. They end up spending thousands of dollars due to FoMo
[0:37:38] Kimolainen: And as logn as wow has tokens I will never stop buying once a month its my raid repairs and flasks :p
[0:37:53] Eliannoula: thats a whole ass pc what you spend there
[0:38:29] savke3: jop
[0:38:34] assrug: ofc you'll never be able to completely disable rmt but gdkp allows great flexibility and opacity since alot of the players involved will not be part of the rmt and there is no need for inter-player communication with regards to rmt
[0:38:43] xzayvionx: I've legit played with people that have spent their rent money and shit like that.
[0:38:47] kontcuk: they dialed back power creep hard on sod btw, new epic staff is only a sidegrade for healer mages
[0:39:24] kontcuk: level 25 staff from bfd has almost the same stats as level 40 staff from gnomeregan
[0:40:22] TheMysticBean: It's the same with Diablo, id rather buy the mats for bosses instead of wasting time farming them
[0:40:33] xzayvionx: Scripe. Pay to win confirmed. :P
[0:41:13] kontcuk: not buying a skin is indeed crazy
[0:41:29] kontcuk: a few years ago due to turkish currency conversion they were dirt cheap
[0:41:31] kenzjzo: skin is extra attack power man
[0:41:47] assrug: if i need to grind for a day for something that i could buy with money i earn in an hour thats fine if it's more than that it gets unejoyable for me
[0:42:28] kontcuk: godbless

[1:28:50] b0vril: @Eliannoula I'm thinking that TGP and the first tier will overlap enough that several of the FFXIV raid team will be unavailable.
[1:29:10] MuffinCompiler: ^ also my guess, but who knows
[1:29:26] MuffinCompiler: Deadge key

[3:27:37] Hurbob14: weird take
[3:27:49] spaeltchenbtw: DansGame cold coffee
[3:30:06] iMuru: ok, hypothetically, how cursed is it to heat up coffee in the microwave
[3:30:26] tvilk: very
[3:32:02] Maitel: better to drink ot cold
[3:32:14] spaeltchenbtw: @iMuru Naah thats ok i do that too
[3:32:22] tvilk: something something bacteria
[3:32:40] iMuru: @tvilk Feelycrafting biology or
[3:32:52] verpixelt__: That's the same ppl who call instant coffee coffee ... mircowave ... tzzz^^
[3:33:07] tvilk: its something like you dont wanna reheat food or drinks in the microwave if it's been out for a while
[3:33:14] tvilk: and a cold coffee usually means its been out for a while
[3:34:40] iMuru: well its cold after 30 minutes sometimes
[3:34:42] tvilk: its a 6 min boss fight
[3:34:43] iMuru: that not that long
[3:34:43] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[3:35:00] tvilk: @iMuru if its been out for more than 10 min dont put it in the microwave
[3:35:07] iMuru: HUHH
[3:35:08] spaeltchenbtw: What
[3:35:12] iMuru: bro
[3:35:38] tvilk: im just telling you what ive heard
[3:35:42] Maitel: I just think it would taste weird microwaved
[3:35:50] Maitel: I would rather drink it cold or make a new one
[3:35:50] iMuru: no shot right?
[3:36:06] iMuru: @tvilk yea fair. i think id be dead tho if thats a "dangerous" amount of time
[3:36:08] spaeltchenbtw: @Maitel it tastes just as if it was fresh coffee really
[3:36:20] MuffinCompiler: just use the coffee in your PCs liquid cooling cycle, always stays warm :)
[3:36:23] tvilk: its different if you heat it over the stove or something, its the microwave specifically the way it heats up the water thats not good
[3:36:32] tvilk: something with bacteria
[3:36:34] spaeltchenbtw: whaaat
[3:36:46] tvilk: but if you cook it on the stove again or whatever you use to boil water its fine
[3:37:05] spaeltchenbtw: It's literally just small waves that make the molecules move fast so it gets hot
[3:37:06] Maitel: dont put your coffee back in the coffee maker of kettle
[3:37:25] tvilk: @spaeltchenbtw yeah thats the issue, you need to boil the water to kill the germs
[3:37:26] iMuru: ohh its specifically coffee that you shouldnt reheat. i see
[3:37:56] iMuru: thought for a second that it also applies to normal food
[3:38:02] MuffinCompiler: When you microwave coffee, the heating process happens extremely quickly. This can cause additional chemical reactions, leading to a bitter aftertaste. If you do choose to reheat coffee in the microwave, make sure to heat it in 20 to 30-second intervals to avoid overheating it.
[3:38:11] Maitel: definitely do not microwave tea
[3:38:12] iMuru: NOTED
[3:38:16] tvilk: NOTED
[3:38:26] tvilk: i guess im wrong then
[3:38:37] iMuru: ja well at that point just make a new coffee yea
[3:38:44] iMuru: fucking 20 minutes KEKW
[3:38:45] MuffinCompiler: just what google said KEKW
[3:38:58] tvilk: i just heard that heating the water from the microwave does something to the germs, but if you heat it to boiling temperatures it kills the germs
[3:39:25] iMuru: fuck it. im just gonna get one of those heating pads for a cup or something
[3:39:39] narwien1: fucking hell, that fight is cancer
[3:39:43] Maitel: I knew it would taste weird
[3:39:56] injos: Easier with 2 ranged + 1 melee.
[3:40:49] spaeltchenbtw: The problem with bacteria only occurs if you have milk in your coffe etc i think
[3:40:58] tvilk: omg
[3:41:00] tvilk: ICANT
