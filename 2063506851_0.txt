[2:54:50] xbento: Apes together smart
[2:54:50] Nightbot: Wep skill above 305 is good, the theory that you get little benefit beyond 305 was created by the guild APES, under aliases, before classic was released in a warrior discord known as Fight Club. APES chose pvp races that don't get the extra weapon skill bonus but wanted to keep the competition within reach. They have succeeded, until now. One man was brave enough to buy edgemaster on his orc warrior and test out the damage on lvl 63 or “boss” mobs, and the data is astonishing.
[2:56:29] Schrecknet: Have you had any otch to play a mage again? As a change of pace? I miss the fatty ignites lol
