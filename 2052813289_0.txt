[6:00:55] nosebleedlol: The key ingredient here is lactic acid: in an unstressed animal, after death, muscle glycogen is converted into lactic acid, which helps keep meat tender, pink, and flavorful. Adrenaline released by stress before slaughter uses up glycogen, which means there's not enough lactic acid produced postmortem.

[7:27:24] skorpio19: because you can't regenerate gas
[7:27:42] Kettsey: Alternator
[7:27:45] khoseah: cuz it saves on materials
[7:28:09] MsLunaMGS: I think hybrids are the way to go imo, use the gas as a suplement while the car constantly charges itself

[7:29:04] tacodoc: Getting cheaper though
[7:29:11] jazni_23: i remember my 97 civic got 45mpg easy
[7:29:13] caredawg: I have that exact car, a hybrid that's not plug in.. It uses about 0,5 l per 10km. It's like meh.. I don't know. I thought about it after buying it
[7:29:51] jazni_23: civic was a stick and you just learn to drive correctly if you're worried about mpg
