[1:49:50] 0xm0_hk: the truth in his mind SCHIZO
[1:49:52] kulakless: BatChest assmon based take
[1:49:53] slug_22: offcourse he is, he doesnt play it
[1:49:53] Nyanalol: he is talking about GDKP in original Wotlk, he doesnt know how it works now and what it means
[1:49:56] flawless_jv: Asmon plays for a day and thinks he knows the game fully

[1:50:56] dunark_: Phahman you dont think rmt is bad?
[1:50:58] kulakless: he would put your usercard on screen and ban you afterwards
[1:51:01] brawnyprawn: true
[1:51:02] wolf79x: I mean isnt false
[1:51:03] vision42g: 4Head
[1:51:03] Gurrehh: just ban them 4Head
[1:51:04] tw1ZTER: just ban the bots 4Head
[1:51:08] fwankey: 4Head
[1:51:09] Runekdabest: He doesnt even play
[1:51:12] Mybhomie: 4Head
[1:51:16] pengwin06: gdkp meta even from early classic to late classic were a major different
[1:51:23] brawnyprawn: they lose more money trying to ban them than not
[1:51:23] sewais: bots are lirly flyhacking. very hard to ban KEKL
[1:51:30] noticip: they could just hire me for 15 eu / hour and i ban everyone
[1:51:33] aty_13: It's the police's fault that there is crime because they don't catch all the criminals ReallyMad
[1:51:35] irrelephant5: this shows that they care honestly
[1:51:37] uber_ific: bots are money in blizzards pocket
[1:51:42] 0xm0_hk: SCHIZO take
[1:51:48] Phahman: @dunark_ i think its impossible to prevent it, and its just how the game is, cant change it
[1:51:51] Habblanen: What will happen haha
[1:51:51] Zyrax11: watch the world burn xddBased
[1:51:56] uber_ific: bot accounts*
[1:51:56] ambatukek: @sewais I heard fly hackers get ported somewhere and can't move anymore KEKInsane but not sure if true
[1:52:00] Habblanen: Gold buyers stop playing?
[1:52:02] vision42g: peepoRiot we ll show whats gonna happen
[1:52:02] therealEsquire: Gold buying will obviously go down. Blizz will call it a win and ship the GDKP ban to WotLK
[1:52:05] Mybhomie: So gdps will be banned for sod?

[1:52:24] Mico027: cant wait to see the redit post about people whining about being banned
[1:52:28] wladqz: @JokerdTV yo do you have source to what you said about hour ago that blizzard might be open to do SoD TBC?
[1:52:29] Rusteyz: so strange banning gdkp on sod, but not on any other version
[1:52:33] lyrie77: If they can track gdkp transactions as they, surely they can track every instance of gold buying in general and do 6month bans, right? Why not ban gold buying entirely instead of banning gdkp? @JokerdTV
[1:52:54] Zyrax11: but gdkp is the only reason why there are gold buyers, atleast thats what everyone says Clueless
[1:52:54] Phahman: @dunark_ thats the thing, its not a bad take, its just an out of touch unrealistic take
[1:53:05] peel2g: gdkps will just trade in commodities instead of gold ... flasks for example
[1:53:10] rullehjem: Baseg
[1:53:11] Fetta_Bishottata: i bet the goldbuyers gonna get ban easly bc moving gold by mail from different account will count as goldbuying and ppl will risk a ban
[1:53:18] ambatukek: SoD is WoW 2.0 KEKInsane
[1:53:20] SgtRuin: @Rusteyz they will propably push it to other versions if the community reacts positively to it
[1:53:22] 0xm0_hk: how rot is ur brain if u are wondering if this move i good or not KEKInsane
[1:53:24] Stevenseagullol: think its nice they do it, and the thing with sod is, if it turns out to be bad, they can just lift the ban for p3
[1:53:42] Mybhomie: @lyrie77 It's very difficult to differentiate between gold buying and friend sending gold or fan etc
[1:53:43] rullehjem: GDKP's banned, WoW is healing Pog
[1:53:45] chr47: SoD for sure is the best place to do it
[1:53:46] Rusteyz: i did my first gdkp on sod last night. whopping 8g cut
[1:53:53] Emyn___: ban it in cata too Baseg
[1:53:54] roxigar12: they try on sod cause there is no wow token
[1:53:55] noticip: they should have tried out it on the lesser played versions tho
[1:53:57] brawnyprawn: WoW2 baby!
[1:54:05] SirStefoto: no spoilers please KEKW
[1:54:08] rizcitron: yea sod is the labotary of wow

[1:54:27] 0xm0_hk: no wow token yet YEP
[1:54:44] xMASI_: Yeah I need a gathering alt now haha. New life
[1:54:49] lyrie77: @Mybhomie If they can track gdkp transactions as they, surely they can track every instance of gold buying in general and do 6month bans, right? Why not ban gold buying entirely instead of banning gdkp? @JokerdTV  󠀀

[1:55:53] 0xm0_hk: CAUGHT
[1:55:54] overkillz666: but from where will they get gold if they cant gtkp?
[1:55:56] sadbadmad1: so easy to buy gold
[1:55:56] aty_13: Do GDKPs in wrath and trade gold 5Head
[1:55:58] Stevenseagullol: @lyrie77 think it takes an incredible amount of resources with all the transactions going on, so yeah they probably could do it, but it would take a lot of man power / money
[1:55:58] twistedopossum: KEKL
[1:55:59] wolf79x: I mean people that like to raid but dont want to farm gold of course gonna buy gold or lower amount of toons played
[1:55:59] krakosek: no cons meta
[1:55:59] xMASI_: Probably yeah
[1:56:00] buck_nazty: don't be afraid bro
[1:56:00] sewais: are they gonna quit.
[1:56:01] Habblanen: consume prices goes up thanks to gold farmers/gdkps
[1:56:03] brawnyprawn: Are they gonna get banned for buying gold? Probly not :p 3
[1:56:04] Hooooly_Moly: Do you think they will let us aoe farm ZF next phase? :D
[1:56:04] j1gge: i have 9 characters. 9 25's and have done 0 gdkps. never been short of any consumes.
[1:56:05] tiveron123: i bought 3k gold yesterday, im good on my 10 characters now
[1:56:06] Zyrax11: now they buy the entire AH xdx
[1:56:09] Spoxah: @Mico027 I know multiple people who buy gold and don't ever go to gdkps

[1:56:41] gdkpgold: ban gdkp? no problem, just dont raid with consums ReallyNice
[1:56:50] SgtRuin: didn't they have to buy gold just to participate in GDKPS? @JokerdTV
[1:56:53] Spoxah: @Niksen_99 for sure it should be
[1:56:53] Ak3rf3ldt: Fast forward to 60 the player base will be trimmed too
[1:57:00] pengwin06: everything that happens now will go into sod classic 15 years from now, we either have nostalgia for gdkp or guild raiding
[1:57:02] lyrie77: @lyrie77 So they essentially just forbid gdkp advertising in the ingame chat? if they can't track it as they claim. GDKPs are not going anywhere then
[1:57:02] mumble1705: Me :)
[1:57:03] mazian4: Farming gold in classic is the most enjoyable out of any version
[1:57:06] bimyouX: How long will it take to dungeon level to lvl 40, taking into consideration that we are really overpowered because of runes&also gear
[1:57:07] tiveron123: i have 12 characters and i still work 7 hours day
[1:57:08] overkillz666: @JokerdTV  do you think sod p2  should have strated sooner
[1:57:13] Sled284: where did the wealth come from the gdkp players?
[1:57:19] xMASI_: The raid only takes 20 minutes as well
[1:57:21] twistedopossum: having 4/5 char is ez af
[1:57:26] Moronoa: really happy that goldbuying retail andys get sort out with this change

[1:57:30] Jar3ed: @bimyouX blizz have stated they are making mobs in the world and dungeons stronger to account for the power creep
[1:57:41] Hooooly_Moly: Do you think they will let us aoe farm ZF next phase? :D
[1:57:44] SgtRuin: @Sled284 RMT?

[6:29:43] Zodalite: The amount of "gold" doesnt really matter tho? It's the price of an item in dollars.

[6:30:06] Zolacee: idm oiler buying my item for astronomical price and i just get it next week for fraction and make money in process
[6:30:09] itsugba: @JokerdTV lets put it this way too: i enjoy farming and making gold from selling stuff. the more bots there are, because gdkp andys need gold, the less i enjoy farming because you usually cant outfarm 20 bots that farm the same stuff that you do.
[6:30:15] SluggEU: @Zodalite price in dollars would not matter for inflation
[6:30:17] based_takes: with that logic any trading promotes gold buying metal
[6:30:17] lKazeh: gdkp = 75 % of gbuying
[6:30:17] Fenclaej: notice they didn't ban anywhere where there is a WOW token
[6:30:22] xtrathicccc: bots will be bots. if gold buying didn’t exist, you would still have indo 5 year old farmers hard camping every single black lotus spawn points with multiple accounts. there’s just no way around bots. it’s natural in todays gaming

[6:45:22] Demobalderes: Imagine quitting an MMO because you got 4 set
[6:45:25] Demobalderes: Gotta be a complete moron
[6:45:28] Ambroscious: the only people defending gdkp are just lazy gold buyers, RMT is bad for a game. It encourages the worst types of players and turns competition into a festering p2w environment. N o GDKP doesn't mean you're not going to get loot, you just need to work for it and win the rolls. It's actually a mind blowing concept.

[6:54:48] FazonTV: Hello Joker! Will you aoe grind your mage to 40?
[6:54:54] CatrielHH: your problems with the inflation are the bots, not the normal sellers
[6:55:02] Ambroscious: but wow tokens actually stimulate the economy
[6:55:07] Ambroscious: bots hurt the economy
[6:55:19] aquilon___: by buying gold from sellers you also support botting - by buying from blizz you arguably don't
[6:55:20] arcturion_kthx: crazy thought, what if the game's API just didn't let you script it so damn much
[6:55:31] arcturion_kthx: so you couldn't program a bot so easily
[6:55:33] gdkpgold: rather support venezuela bot miner than bobby cokdik

[7:03:33] Chnip_: boost

[7:04:33] yung_gab_: trash raid
[7:04:43] MonzonWasTaken: yea pvp is a huge gold sink
[7:04:45] swingler93: player greed - make elixer using 10s worth of materials and 1h of farming profs, selling for 1g on AH, everyone else follows, self inflated prices - so people buy gold to recoup on consums
[7:04:54] Drelnar: I love how SOD p2 starts right when I leave for a 4 weeks trip to New Zealand XD
