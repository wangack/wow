[2:38:17] iNSANEono: get farmed nerds 4Head
[2:38:25] KingMavros: @Oopogo1 tbh the 3 day lockout is more of a problem than the phase timer. A lot of guilds getting burned already doing bfd on 3 chars+ every 3 days

[2:41:06] exec92: insane330XD
[2:41:22] exec92: 5 day lockout and people would cry about that instead
[2:41:37] Oopogo1: if next phase doesn't have more content than this it'll be dead in half the time because ppl know their scheme to milk it now
[2:41:39] iNSANEono: Clap sod is literally nost if u only play 15min per week
[2:42:45] feey14: it's around 30 euros in EU...

[4:59:01] NINCOMPOOP__DUDE: I just did a psychoanalysis on your current warlock "Blackedmagic", you did not use that as a name because it is clever, because its not very clever. It just accentuates your deep desire of getting cucked by a strong black man. that gets you going doesn't it? And you enjoy peacocking to other people this desire, and have the plausible deniability to wave it off as a "joke" (which it is not.)
