[1:58:41] Ronangic: i think if it ever comes back it'll be for lots of gold again
[1:58:52] misomander: i mean it is back technically
[1:58:53] misomander: on bmah
[1:58:55] DwarfWarrior25: only way to get a long boi now is through the Black auction house and it always goes for gold cap
[1:59:07] beerandwaffles: I would be pissed. I grided so hard for it
[1:59:16] TokenZarathez: i think it should come back but maybe without the auction house feature? So you get the cool mount but people still feel like they got something for their gold
[1:59:46] Biggins_Prime: it was just a gold sink.  so many people mad bank via WoD mission table this gave them a way to try to take some of that gold out of thee conomy
[1:59:57] Masqerader: @TokenZarathez no one would want it then

[3:21:46] RalgorStreams: I think I’m lvl 12 or something
[3:21:58] Daemoos6: wth, Steam shows you have more time played in ESO than FF14 and Lost Ark
[3:22:22] LesNevralgiques: Doing better than yesterday, for some reason my USB ports were all shutting down randomly last night, I found the issue this morning after like 3 hours of fucking around
[3:22:30] Daemoos6: same thing for Marbles on Stream LUL
[3:22:36] LesNevralgiques: What about you man?
[3:22:51] LesNevralgiques: Not even my board is new
[3:22:51] Daemoos6: Almost 144h for BG3
[3:23:14] casualdadnz: morning all luxthoHi
[3:23:21] LesNevralgiques: I used a longer type-C cable for my camera, and that was the issue, I switched back to the origin cable which is shorter, and it stopped
[3:23:30] LesNevralgiques: So a 20 feet type-c cable was causing all this shit
[3:23:51] LesNevralgiques: Yep exactly
[3:24:10] mentosz09: !lurk
[3:24:11] StreamElements: mentosz09 is now lurking! luxthoLurk
[3:24:16] LesNevralgiques: maybe it's not the distance, maybe it's just the quality of the cable I dunno, I went back to the OG one and it stopped entirely
[3:24:32] NoodlezNoggin: USB standard says you can't use more than like 5 meters passively.  You need a special active USB cable to go longer.
[3:24:37] MaxGrandpre: ^^
[3:24:39] LesNevralgiques: ^
[3:24:41] MaxGrandpre: because resistance
[3:24:45] Arore_1599: its does.. the longer the cable the more power you need
[3:24:48] LesNevralgiques: Yeah that's what the IT at my workplace told me
[3:24:50] ShadowdamTNM: Sony state of play is in 2 hrs idk if you have any interest in that.. it's usually just a 30min stream of upcoming titles /trailer etc.
[3:25:05] Mhakxym: @MaxGrandpre bon matin !

[3:34:33] LesNevralgiques: Suicide Squad dude LOL
[3:34:41] LesNevralgiques: it's not even a good game tho
[3:34:45] Voidthos: @LesNevralgiques The island was a lot of fun.  I'm level 60 on chapter 13 and story content is like 40ish
[3:34:51] DwarfWarrior25: !gamble all

[3:43:05] LesNevralgiques: @ermymunster there is no winning, only work.
[3:43:13] exaltyred: do you plan on checking out Granblue Fantasy Relink?
[3:43:13] Daemoos6: Stroke over?
[3:43:23] ermymunster: @LesNevralgiques That doesn't sound like a very fun game
[3:43:30] GrimGoreRMW: https://clips.twitch.tv/OptimisticTemperedJaguarWoofer-MCDm9ZCN8arNOCfJ
[3:43:44] LesNevralgiques: @ermymunster that's the catch, IT'S NOT A GAME lesnevCry
[3:43:48] Poxumo: I won the work game.
[3:43:48] LesNevralgiques: hahaha
[3:44:00] LesNevralgiques: I just can't wait for the day to be over and go back to Yakuza.
[3:44:24] LesNevralgiques: But aside from working, I'm watching this streamer on twitch with a rat tail hidden in his capuchon caliss
[3:44:27] Poxumo: get paid retirement and disability for life and only worked 20 years
[3:44:30] LesNevralgiques: just your average wednesday
[3:44:32] ermymunster: @LesNevralgiques I'm trying to finish up all my class work for the week so I can just veg out and play. luxthoDead I'm on the previous Yakuza game still
[3:44:51] ermymunster: @Poxumo Army? KEKW
[3:45:07] Poxumo: @ermymunster Navy
[3:45:16] LesNevralgiques: @ermymunster you're doing 7? the first one with Ichiban? Lot of people in our chat started it because of my hype for Infinite Wealth
[3:45:23] ermymunster: @Poxumo Nice, thank you for your service! My husband is former army/nat guard
[3:45:44] ermymunster: @LesNevralgiques Yes, I started it when it came out and got distracted by something else KEKW so now I'm finishing it so I can play IW
[3:45:45] Poxumo: @ermymunster Awesome! and you are welcome!
[3:45:57] Finiin: !gamble 1%

[3:46:30] LesNevralgiques: @ermymunster I kinda did the same thing back then too, started it, dropped after a couple of chapters, and played it again at the beginning of last year, it's so good legit
[3:47:24] jarilrpg: @Luxthos hey lux, are you going to watch the state of play later?
[3:47:57] ermymunster: 5pm yes
[3:48:08] Daemoos6: Why? Your PS5 is a dust collector LUL
[3:48:31] ermymunster: @Daemoos6 I NEED TO SEE MORE WEEB GAMES
[3:49:02] Finiin: I was just going to say some of the games could come out on PC also
[3:49:13] ermymunster: ~40-45 minutes they said
[3:49:17] Finiin: they said this one is over 40mins
[3:49:30] LesNevralgiques: Rise of Ronin is gonna be shown a bit more, I'm excited for that, but it comes out the same exact FUCKING day as Dragon's Dogma 2
[3:49:54] ermymunster: "Tune in on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok this Wednesday at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for 40 minutes covering 15+ games, including extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Ronin, plus more from talented game developers from around the world."
[3:50:22] ermymunster: They're probably gonna show the last big trailer for FF7
[3:50:54] faheeee: Hey Lux long time no see I am back to pester you now I have a  question how do you make it on your wa were when a charge of Prescience comes off cooldown there is a sound that it made so I use it
[3:50:54] Finiin: anyone in chat ever install mods from Nexus Mods? how hard is it to install mods if I've never done it before?
[3:51:06] ermymunster: @Finiin Not hard at all if you use their installer
[3:51:42] Finiin: @ermymunster ok i'll use that then
[3:51:52] ermymunster: @Finiin If you use their installer, you just pick whatever mod you want on their website, it'll auto open the installer, and it gets you all set
[3:52:16] Lemon_King: Lay on Ham?
[3:52:16] jjwoodard10: you still had forbenance
[3:52:53] Roughneck0: are you tanking ?
[3:54:08] jarilrpg: it was the appropriate sound effect for Lay on Ham
[3:54:44] Finiin: @ermymunster Thanks so much, I was looking at the site and was like I have no clue how to do this lol
[3:55:12] Aggy: I love that I got no answer for the emote but it's already uploaded LUL
[3:55:13] Aggy: luxthoAngry
[3:56:03] ermymunster: @Finiin No problem! It used to be a pain in the ass cause every game had a different method but thankfully Nexus made their own installer to make it easier KEKW
[3:56:32] faheeee: can you show me how to do it
[3:56:58] faheeee: Prescience
[3:57:26] faheeee: I am stupid when it comes to wa
[3:58:02] GrimGoreRMW: Leeroy Jenkinsthos
[3:58:16] ChromaticTank: KEKW
[3:58:39] LesNevralgiques: Don't install mods on Capcom games, that's my only advice
[3:58:47] morp1onz: Speaking of AlterEgo, I saw it when I started watching you but had no osund, what is the difference between that and SavedInstances ?
[3:59:03] faheeee: Since Presience has two charges when you use both charges I just need it to make a sound when 1 of the charges comes off cooldown
[3:59:33] LesNevralgiques: Some dude installed a naked Chun-Li mod during a tournament and now capcom is adding a bunch of protection to counter mods in all of their games. I'm sure that if someone does it again they'll just fucking delete games entirely, they're so intense man.
[3:59:39] Finiin: I'm just doing skyrim and such. nothing mutliplayer
[3:59:58] morp1onz: Can it tracks the currencies ?
[4:00:39] LesNevralgiques: Are you hyped about Dragon's Dogma 2 dude? I hope so, that game is gonna be special
[4:00:40] Lemon_King: @LesNevralgiques The DRM doesn't block modding. MaxDood already covered this.
[4:01:39] RalgorStreams: "Presh- ence"  :)
[4:02:01] RalgorStreams: i had to look it up recently for pronunciation lol
[4:02:12] LesNevralgiques: @Lemon_King nah but the protection they added is doing a bunch of bullshit like preventing Monster Hunter from being played on Steam Deck and all. It doesn't BLOCK modding but it created a whole lot of issues on games that were perfectly fine before, because of that one dude.
[4:02:58] Lemon_King: @LesNevralgiques Thats an issue with the DRM, disallowing VM and WINE/Whiskey play.
[4:04:03] GrimGoreRMW: BAM
[4:04:11] GrimGoreRMW: luxthoBonk
[4:04:19] DarkBlueTree: @Finiin On nexusmods, for each game, someone will usually create a mod "installer"/organizer.   You can use this to process all your mods or just do it manually.   You would just need to understand the directories involved for your game to do it manually.   Usually need to know those dirs even for the "installer"
[4:04:33] Daemoos6: While you checking WAs, pinged you in a ticket
[4:04:40] sl1nky1981: I need to make some custom sound WA's
[4:04:54] sl1nky1981: I can see that being useful for Immo Aura resets on DH
[4:05:33] Finiin: @DarkBlueTree I just ended up getting the Nexus mod manager, hopefully that works for the one's i want
[4:06:53] faheeee: ok thanks
