[1:08:23] itouchbuttons: @huckleson right the whole point of SoD was to just fill something new while Classic era and Retail update

[1:08:49] HeisyTV: NOP
[1:08:51] Ravenward: yepBanana discover deez nuts on ur chin
[1:08:52] ClinxyWow: no duel spec
[1:08:53] Knaxxis: @huckleson  was that ur strategy for attention from xaryu?
[1:08:55] huckleson: @Knaxxis Xaryu literally dueled shit rogues when he was bis geared ahead of the curve and now. Rogue beats mage with cds ALL DAY
[1:08:55] EnigmaticHD: This is seriously not new information at all. Click bait
[1:08:57] mimic124: wow players don't complain about the game challenge (impossible)
[1:09:02] CamGG__: Need dual spec asap
[1:09:03] arlend_3: yess, dual spec :D
[1:09:03] justaround31: I like this guys content, but he has too many facial expressions
[1:09:10] ClinxyWow: they reduced respec price
[1:09:13] ClinxyWow: boom fixed
[1:09:16] HeisyTV: YEP
[1:09:18] arlend_3: not good enough
[1:09:26] huckleson: @Knaxxis xaryu dueled a few times a month ago and decided he had all the info he needed kekw
[1:09:28] MadCaptainDuck: respec cost is still stupid
[1:09:31] Knaxxis: @huckleson  im aware of how pvp works i have like pure 99's and im full bis and world pvp pretty much all day and ive never lost to a mage
[1:09:31] Zahnstocherzimtstern: doualspecc is big +
[1:09:32] ClinxyWow: yeah, this dudes take was dumb
[1:09:35] F1reline: I'd like dual spec just for pvp & pve specs
[1:09:37] Nyt_Ram: im craving dual spec
[1:09:38] stuffe92: runes is more op then talents KEKW
[1:09:40] wrec7: I agree
[1:09:43] Tropicocity: Have they? Idk, it was 10s start, I've only respecced like twice but won't it go up to 1G+ eventually?
[1:09:44] Beriech: I need dual spec so bad
[1:09:45] Colddaylight: This entire take about SoD is dumb
[1:09:46] Aviin: would be nice for hybrid classes
[1:09:46] kisamabuti: the resilience they added to armor kills open world pvp because if you don’t pvp regularly and have that gear you aren’t going to pvp with someone that does have it.
[1:09:46] huckleson: @Knaxxis you a rogue too???
[1:09:51] MickizTV: dual spec would be huge imo
[1:09:53] arlend_3: whys that orc with an alliance tabard?
[1:09:54] Knaxxis: @huckleson  one of the best
[1:09:56] CamGG__: I think it will be need more at 40-50-60 caps
[1:09:57] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:09:58] twitchforgotmyaccount: Yeah, but at level 25 the talents don't matter all that much. It's way bigger at 40+
[1:09:59] Malornhan: as a druid i want it for sure
[1:10:00] safari3: dual spec is lame
[1:10:08] huckleson: @Knaxxis same bruv, all 99s as well. Thats what im saying ive never lost to a mage
[1:10:11] shumba_don: hi guzu and chat. what is the best rouge pvp build for warong gulch ?
[1:10:12] huckleson: @Knaxxis xar was on copium

[1:10:43] F1reline: Wrath price KEKW
[1:10:45] Tropicocity: it would be nice to be able to switch between dps/heal or dps/tank on the fly depending on the encounter
[1:10:47] itouchbuttons: Dual spec change in Inn's only
[1:10:50] ImPanzar: As a holy paladin i like this, then I can farm as retri and raid/dungeon as holy
[1:10:56] holme08: Imagine if they added a new BG at level 60. Thoughts Guzu? :P
[1:11:05] Tropicocity: Mounts are already half price YEP
[1:11:09] MickizTV: Just swipe the card YEP
[1:11:13] Curtsy: with all the gold in the game already dual spec should be 3k tbh
[1:11:13] kheetor: when will p2 come?
[1:11:14] Guzumerchmanager: gold is already super inflated LUL why even make it less
[1:11:21] Tropicocity: @kheetor feb 8th
[1:11:23] TrueNosus: id rather respects just be next then free
[1:11:24] mcboonee: ooooo
[1:11:27] ClinxyWow: the dota bg?!
[1:11:29] victorinox1609: riding will cost 50 bucks
[1:11:31] huckleson: @Knaxxis even in savix's tier list, he said rogues beat mages with all cd's. Xar just out of touch on that one. Lil bro dont even pvp anymore lmao
[1:11:32] itouchbuttons: I'd like battle for Gilneas lol

[1:11:42] holme08: Would be really cool <3
[1:11:43] kheetor: @Tropicocity oo, nice PopCorn ty
[1:11:51] TrueNosus: the problem with duel spec is anytime a player has to return to the capitol city, it creates opportunity for social experience, or seeing a giga chad geared player to aspire to ect @Guzu
[1:11:57] StreamElements: Cool IRL Posts and Pictures HERE! https://www.instagram.com/guzuTV

[1:12:34] kleardeath: I want a dual spec. I play resto shaman and when I am not raiding I would like to be able to dps.
[1:12:37] ClinxyWow: dual spec is dumb
[1:12:42] prodigy_wow: We really need gold dumps not that it actually prevents inflation much
[1:12:44] Knaxxis: how is dual spec dumb?
[1:12:45] ashtaroxx: plunk it's just qol, i dont mind it nor do i care

[1:13:13] mcboonee: payoOld
[1:13:13] KaZyk: please don't fucking delay it, I took time off work just to get a couple days to myself without my kids n shit to no-life the game for 2-3 days
[1:13:18] F1reline: I probably won't even get to 40 by delayed time either KEKW
[1:13:19] arlend_3: enjoy the grind
[1:13:23] Blufootgaming: not delaying it affects no one, delaying it affects anyone who wants to minmax. its such a bs thing to do
[1:13:30] mcboonee: payoY
[1:13:32] adparticular1: damn boy he thicc
[1:13:33] yur0o0o: KKona
[1:13:33] ashtaroxx: plunk the only people that care about the raid getting delayed are the forum andies or the top 5% players
[1:13:46] wisenot: but why block the super tryhards? let they do their thing :/
[1:13:47] Jalapinot: NODDERS Delay
[1:13:49] Neffehh: some people like nolifing launch, why gatekeep
[1:13:49] Colddaylight: Who cares
[1:13:50] ghost____23: dont delay it ffs they delayed the phase enough already
[1:13:51] Knaxxis: i mean they cater they game now to casual bad players - cause thats like 80% of the playerbase. bad casuals
[1:13:54] Guzumerchmanager: @Blufootgaming YEP the casuals will stil have another 3 months to do gnomeregn doesnt matter
[1:13:59] Knaxxis: so a delay makes sense
[1:14:01] Jalapinot: NODDERS Delay is good
[1:14:04] adparticular1: I HATE CASUALS ReallyMad
[1:14:07] Trexbo_: Shruge It wasnt that bad of a picture
[1:14:07] bletso: NOWAY
[1:14:08] Curtsy: @ghost____23 They haven't delayed it a single time
[1:14:10] SirHicarus: Shocking
[1:14:11] Colddaylight: This is no longer about SOD.. this is about the WoW he wants.. not the game you're gonna get
[1:14:12] Guzumerchmanager: casuals are just overall shit @adparticular1 Clap
[1:14:12] mimic124: world first death to the elevator boss
[1:14:13] Guzumerchmanager: fricc casuals
[1:14:14] Addrid: fuck 10man raids, i want 10-25 scaling raids RAGEY

[1:14:19] chickodie: boomkin tanks
[1:14:22] adparticular1: I WANNA SWEATLORD A 20 YEAR OLD GAME ReallyMad
[1:14:25] Boneyards_666: consume THESE
[1:14:28] CamGG__: Delay makes total sense, instant access puts pressure on every player to race to 40.
[1:14:28] Zecxx: I kinda like the delays but I also think the sweats are just gonna grief questing areas without their raids to run
[1:14:29] F1reline: @Method_Quando And the one's knocking it out asap will complain that the next phase takes too long. The whole reason is not to rush things in SoD
[1:14:29] Blufootgaming: @Blufootgaming might be 4 months with how sleepy they are
[1:14:38] Ebsoni: i dont care if they delay or not. but delay has more positive sides than negatives
[1:14:41] Somra: retail player in chat
[1:14:42] yur0o0o: they ask and then do oposite thing as always dont forget is blizzard
[1:14:42] Knaxxis: nah i get it it jsut sucks for hyper gamers
[1:14:42] flowerpew: fricc casuals fricc sweatlords fricc don't release it at all
[1:14:44] prodigy_wow: You need to cater to the sheep, we need them to populate the server
[1:14:45] Curtsy: Bro has no life and wants the game to be built around him KEKW
[1:14:45] megaxbrain: ReallyMad let me be good
[1:14:48] hagspretten: Like they did with overwatch? u see how that game ended up :p
[1:14:51] Tropicocity: sweatlords have retail to attempt mythic raids and +30 dungeons tbh
[1:14:54] chickenwienersoup: why even go fast, they'll be maxed and raiding in a week, then back to complaining nothing to do
[1:14:54] ashtaroxx: plunk more like there are infinite games nowdays that people can play and not just WoW
[1:14:58] SirHicarus: fricc everyone
[1:14:58] adparticular1: WANT LOSED? LET ME BE BEST ReallyMad
[1:14:59] Guzumerchmanager: @F1reline they will just do it on another 5 chars, i just dont understand why everyone would delay it if it takes the fun out for the people that wanna rush
[1:15:00] Colddaylight: Sweatlords are not the core player base
[1:15:03] megaxbrain: @flowerpew agrreed
[1:15:06] Trexbo_: om
[1:15:07] mcboonee: just play palworld. new meta
[1:15:08] Chlamydious: WOWISDEADBABY
[1:15:12] CamGG__: good solution om
[1:15:13] Fallender: Isnt that the complain most have that mythic content in retail is just for a few % players and they should add content for the main group not the few percent
[1:15:14] Boneyards_666: fricc woW
[1:15:19] t4pekid: DELETE WOW RAGEY
[1:15:20] Neffehh: if its delayed im gonna rush anyway and grief levelers KEKW
[1:15:22] Colddaylight: They like to think so.. but they are the minority everybody ignores
[1:15:23] HeisyTV: Behind ICANT
[1:15:24] Leon81094: but it would be more fun going in the raid wihtout everyone having full prebis and best runes
[1:15:25] Trexbo_: YEP fricc WoW WFire
[1:15:25] mcboonee: pokemon with a gun would 1 shot garrosh
[1:15:26] safari3: There was no poll.. he is just assuming
[1:15:27] Curtsy: @ashtaroxx we just had the best gaming year in ages and people say there's no games KEKW people just addicted to wow
[1:15:30] Guzumerchmanager: it doesnt do anything towards the casuals @F1reline if random XxxXx69lord have the new best weapon from the instances 1 week before Dadgamer420 can get it, who cares
[1:15:30] CamGG__: exactly
[1:15:33] Blufootgaming: if theyre casual why do they care about being behind
[1:15:34] mimic124: I love FOMO YEP
[1:15:35] TRCloud: did you kill akumai yesterday :) ?
[1:15:38] safari3: I doubt he counted all comments
[1:15:44] ashtaroxx: @Curtsy Aware my WoW fix
[1:15:46] Syloa: YEP
[1:15:46] Blufootgaming: this is such a bs mentality
[1:15:50] CamGG__: YEP
[1:15:51] Trexbo_: Fealing of FOMO om FOFOMO
[1:15:52] Land5lide: instead you make 4 alts and raidlog still, wtf is that comment lmao
[1:15:52] ruiyya: yeah the worst
[1:15:54] Somra: @Guzu retail PTSD
[1:15:55] bletso: guzuBeliever
[1:15:58] wisenot: meh being behind sounds like a "you problem" get over it
[1:15:59] Neffehh: why do casuals care if people rush
[1:16:01] Somra: pepeW
[1:16:01] adparticular1: You cant feel fomo... if you cant feel anything BigBrother
[1:16:02] zantu619: No delay, just let people do it ASAP if they want. Doesnt affect anyone else
[1:16:02] Boneyards_666: thats what happens if you dont play the game for a couple of months
[1:16:03] Kedor2k: Thats why they added the 3 days early access for the new retail expansion
[1:16:03] Jalapinot: The phases are time limited, makes sense there is some fomo
[1:16:04] mcboonee: im still thinking about starting tbc. a bit late
[1:16:05] Zahnstocherzimtstern: week 2 no logs? you can basicly delete the char
[1:16:06] ghost____23: thats a part of human emotion we are not npc’s this is not bas
[1:16:08] ghost____23: bad
[1:16:08] poopooindiaper: I think that it's good that they made the 1st phase this long
[1:16:09] wisdom_of_wombats: @Blufootgaming i dont know if youve ever tried getting into a pug week 2+ without any logs
[1:16:10] ritter184: How would you feel about SoD progressing to TBC?
[1:16:14] piperboi: Can i start Retail now?
[1:16:16] p5ycc: maybe u want to start third day so you have time to do questing in peace instead on camping spawn points
[1:16:19] HeisyTV: Unless you are named Payo
[1:16:21] Ebsoni: ive been solo farming and just gaming whatever. its all about having fun (im 30)
[1:16:21] kheetor: raidlogging is only coming from boredom, ie. not having anything else to do
[1:16:24] itskigz: i never raidlog i have 50 25s
[1:16:26] didgeridoo1001: It's hard to get into these kidns of things for the regualr joe.
[1:16:34] wrec7: KEKL

[1:17:06] Guzumerchmanager: this fking streamer
[1:17:09] Addrid: CHILLS
[1:17:11] ashtaroxx: plink lmao
[1:17:11] Guzumerchmanager: can we report the guy in the video ?
[1:17:19] melvinguyy: I GET THESE GOOSEBUMPS EVERYTIME
[1:17:21] The_palumbo: This guy looks like he wants to be a 90s rapper so bad
[1:17:21] Petrichorx_x: Chills BatChest
[1:17:31] megaxbrain: i am literally crying with chills right now
[1:17:32] Guzumerchmanager: "oh ye let me take my time doing the same quest in STV ive done 100 times"
[1:17:36] Syloa: his beard is still not center guzuY
[1:17:37] Arcinatos: Rizz Potter
[1:17:38] p5ycc: thank LORD
[1:17:49] Ebsoni: this guy is a literal zoomer zooming KEKW
[1:17:49] Somra: hyper? monkaW
[1:17:50] chickenwienersoup: I'm so focused on his mustache
[1:17:53] Knaxxis: @megaxbrain  r u okay?
[1:17:56] wrec7: BFD was awesome
[1:17:56] Tropicocity: Dont forget 25-40 will take longer on average than 1-25, the extra week to get to 40 and farm pre-bis will be super useful
[1:18:01] wrec7: especially at the start
[1:18:07] hsayus123: 1st week dust to dust was hilarious
[1:18:07] Arcinatos: its classic, they wont be LuL
[1:18:15] Guzumerchmanager: and that is why rushing towards gnomeregn fast is fun @Guzu cause u get in there with shit green gear and have a blast. instead of another week and everyone will have Pre-bis lvl 40 items when they go in
[1:18:16] TomWhy412: ppl still wipe on akumai @Guzu  ...its fine for casual players
[1:18:17] Modebc: true
[1:18:17] Somra: SMOrc HYPERCLAP DUST TO DUST SMOrc HYPERCLAP DUST TO DUST SMOrc HYPERCLAP DUST TO DUST SMOrc HYPERCLAP DUST TO DUST
[1:18:18] wrec7: YEP
[1:18:22] mcboonee: pfff not even 3 man
[1:18:24] CamGG__: BFD good, clapped once everyone got geared with the hyper loot
[1:18:27] megaxbrain: @Knaxxis no
[1:18:27] flowerpew: if they make a classic raid require more than two braincells wow players will self-combust
[1:18:27] Zahnstocherzimtstern: after your wrath Pug fiasko, you should pray for EZ raids KEKW
[1:18:31] mimic124: I want mythic level raid content at lvl 60 ReallyMad
[1:18:32] HeisyTV: gO tO ReTAiL
[1:18:32] Trexbo_: Bosses were new, we didnt have all the consums and gear YEP
[1:18:33] Syloa: for many people the fun bit about raiding is min maxing and improving. so parses
[1:18:33] Knaxxis: yall; in chat laugh but the first few weeks 90% of yall were 5/7 lol
[1:18:35] ashtaroxx: plunk yep
[1:18:38] hsayus123: YEP
[1:18:39] zartuus: 4 man only 80% you mean
[1:18:41] ralphh1541: nobody wants hard content in classic
[1:18:43] huckleson: yea i started playing retail because of sod lmfaoo
[1:18:46] Tropicocity: @ItsCamGG clapped once FAP and SPP were found to be faceroll items lol
[1:18:51] Somra: retail is just putting your dick in a pencil sharpener pepeW
[1:18:51] p5ycc: I cant w8 to see what they gonna do on the last boss. It seems promising
[1:18:52] huckleson: im so tired of braindead easy content personally
[1:18:55] Blufootgaming: TRUE
[1:18:55] Addrid: @Guzu would you prefer 10-25 scaling raids instead of just 10man raids aswell? or are you okay with 10man raids only
[1:18:55] CamGG__: @Tropicocity true true
[1:18:58] huckleson: tired of playing with 5apm boomers
[1:19:08] Mynester: Hi Guzu peepoEhm
[1:19:09] Mynester: Daily peepoEhm
[1:19:12] CamGG__: yeah I deff wont be in the first few lockouts
[1:19:13] Knaxxis: @Somra  what was the last expansion u played brother
[1:19:14] hsayus123: true
[1:19:14] ClownhairTV: Especially in STV on big servers
[1:19:18] thegreyghost32: Im gonna park my ass in SM lol
[1:19:20] chickenwienersoup: I bet you can run dungeons all the way to 40
[1:19:27] Mynester: Make drums boonable MadgeRightNow
[1:19:27] StreamElements: Go check out my Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/guzutv
[1:19:28] 3Brick_: I like 10 man it is easier to find enough people without it being a hassel
[1:19:28] flowerpew: too many slackers in 25 smh
[1:19:29] CamGG__: really enjoy 10
[1:19:29] Boneyards_666: ICC is still one of my fav raids
[1:19:31] Somra: @Knaxxis mythic jailer. so no thanks
[1:19:33] Foodlebar: 10 man makes sense for small guilds and encourage pugging
[1:19:39] ClownhairTV: The leveling in Arathi and STV is gonna be a living hell KEKW
[1:19:40] HeisyTV: 80 MAN RAIDS
[1:19:41] Knaxxis: @Somra  name on logs?
[1:19:42] mimic124: glad they didn't stilck with 40 man raids
[1:19:44] ashtaroxx: plunk so long they arent 40man raids man
[1:19:49] Somra: @Knaxxis name on who asked
[1:19:54] Knaxxis: thats what i tohught
[1:20:01] megaxbrain: @Knaxxis are you ok?
[1:20:02] zeefen: @Guzu going to be such a good time when 40 is out
[1:20:05] 3Brick_: 40 man raids only seem like a possibility by streamers since they can find people easier
[1:20:06] mcboonee: i dont trust his moustache
[1:20:06] Knaxxis: @megaxbrain  no
[1:20:11] Somra: @Knaxxis retail andy defend your shit harder KEKW
[1:20:14] megaxbrain: @Knaxxis ok just checking
[1:20:14] ashtaroxx: 40man is way too many people because the bosses will either have 1 or 2 mechanics or be too hard plunk
[1:20:24] adparticular1: BigBrother hes a brother
[1:20:24] CamGG__: @Knaxxis ReallyMad No Delay ! Send me your logs ! om you cant be serious Knaxxis
[1:20:38] Ebsoni: these level caps are just to get them more time to get the lvl60 content ready. I think people take these lowlevel things too seriously
[1:20:38] Foodlebar: iAsk do you think people will still farm bfd for the buff when we're all at 40, or will gnomer buff not stack with it hmjj
[1:20:46] Somra: asking for logs when the game is just shit OMEGALULiguess
[1:20:46] Knaxxis: @ItsCamGG  its kanxxis crusader strike
[1:20:47] 3Brick_: 40 man raids only seem like a possibility by streamers since they can find people easier 󠀀
[1:20:51] megaxbrain: @ItsCamGG unfortunately they are serious lol
[1:20:52] Knaxxis: Knaxxis*
[1:20:55] CamGG__: @Knaxxis im not asking.
[1:20:56] Arlique246: with 10 man everyone can form a raid and clear it within an hour. 20 man will take alot longer. i love being able to clear bfd 3 times in 1 evening :P
[1:20:57] flowerpew: there's no race in classic. every classic raid is defated in 10 minutes from release. you can still do race to 40
[1:20:58] Blufootgaming: who cares about the wf race
[1:21:00] hsayus123: world first gnomergan BatChest
[1:21:01] Syloa: most people do not play non stop to clear gnomer. there isnt much of a race. just afew guilds
[1:21:04] Guzumerchmanager: its fun for people doing it, not for the people watching :)
[1:21:13] iRayG2: bro ain’t nobody tryna watch a race to gnomer
[1:21:17] Guzumerchmanager: like the TBC release was fun for us doing the race, would have been a snoozefest for people watching
[1:21:18] Beriech: literally who cares about a race if the only key is grouping and grinding a dungeon until you're 40 without sleeping
[1:21:19] CamGG__: 30 buff time EZ
[1:21:22] fryingsponge: get rid of BFD buff
[1:21:23] zeefen: There gonna cap it that would just be stupid to have both
[1:21:25] TrueNosus: no one cares except giga sweats
[1:21:25] SirHeiska: They need to keep all up to 60
[1:21:27] Arcinatos: gnomer buff better have movespeed ReallyMad
[1:21:27] ashtaroxx: i dont wanna do bfd runs after phase 1 man plunk
[1:21:28] Blufootgaming: just dont delay let people have the fun the way they want, dont let one part of the playerbase ruin the fun of the other
[1:21:30] Mynester: Make drums buff boonable boolie
[1:21:31] Locoleet: make bfd 5man dungeon
[1:21:31] Knaxxis: scrap the bfd buff ands give us a new buff
[1:21:34] ritter184: Just make gnomer the same buff
[1:21:39] ralphh1541: 100%
[1:21:39] Syloa: or cap at 30
[1:21:40] Blufootgaming: YEP no buff after 25
[1:21:41] Beriech: Just make the trinket turn in stop dropping a buff
[1:21:41] hsayus123: YEP lvl 25 cap
[1:21:41] Guzumerchmanager: ye agree with the buff else we end up having to get 10 buffs at lvl 60 LUL
[1:21:43] sorrowquin: cap it at 39, with 40 you can get a mount
[1:21:43] wrec7: @Mynester YES PLS
[1:21:45] Stoxios: @Guzu make the buff work Outside Gnome`??
[1:21:46] Foodlebar: 5Head
[1:21:48] Jazminite: @Guzu - they said they are capping the BFD buff by level
[1:21:49] Knaxxis: new buff ina  new city
[1:21:49] BoonesHQ: The Race through Karazahn Crypts woulld be fun to watch I believe
[1:21:51] Petrichorx_x: well bfd is still gonna be relevent next phase apparently
[1:22:03] SirHeiska: We need 10 wbuffs at 60!
[1:22:05] Knaxxis: thunder bluff is kinda Monka if ur a rogue
[1:22:05] zeefen: scrap the buff would suck for people leveling @ 25+
[1:22:06] Syloa: source?
[1:22:18] ritter184: Lvl 39 would be nice
[1:22:19] Addrid: thats really nice yea

[1:22:37] Tropicocity: @Guzu one of my fav parts of SoD is how random mobs in random places are part of rune questlines
[1:22:43] Tropicocity: it really gives meaning to old shit
[1:22:46] Boneyards_666: plink
[1:22:49] Guzumerchmanager: but ? how does having the instance open right away do anything
[1:22:51] Guzumerchmanager: to how he plays the game
[1:22:53] iRayG2: we need a LFG option built in
[1:22:54] Blufootgaming: Misery
[1:22:56] Syloa: yea not even close om

[1:22:59] Guzumerchmanager: it legit doesnt do anything for him that XX guy can rush into it right away
[1:23:04] HappyPorcupine: I don't care about the delay either way, it has no influence on me
[1:23:06] alexgoat94: @iRayG2 why?
[1:23:06] Metraphim: I love Aggrend being an absolute chad all the way through SoD
[1:23:06] positive_ions: You can still race after a week delay
[1:23:06] chickenwienersoup: just raid at level 39
[1:23:09] flowerpew: poll chat ? PauseChamp
[1:23:10] p5ycc: make one as well Guzu to see what ppl think here
[1:23:11] SirHeiska: I want delay just to see crying
[1:23:16] Syloa: poll it now
[1:23:16] Fallender: Sorry but the real problem are bots and as long as 50% players are bots i dont play wow
[1:23:16] iPlayCuzFun: he even spelled it wrong
[1:23:18] ashtaroxx: plink i personally dont care if it gets delayed or not, i just wanna play phase 2 man
[1:23:19] huckleson: @Metraphim if only his take on premades wasnt totally backwards
[1:23:26] Knaxxis: idk i dont really wanna grab ony,boon,dmf,dmt,songflower,zg,rend and the gnomer buff at 60
[1:23:26] wisenot: open on day 1 go fast if u want to
[1:23:29] Knaxxis: kinda monka
[1:23:32] Trexbo_: fricc your opinion, toilet paper cruncher
[1:23:32] hsayus123: make a poll
[1:23:32] Guzumerchmanager: this is just a casual andy trying to force others how to play the game
[1:23:34] Tropicocity: @Method_Quando My guess is, it puts pressure on people to rush through to 40, and therefore makes PUG groups need 'pre-bis and exp' that much sooner
[1:23:37] Metraphim: Yeh but they doing something about it
[1:23:43] Arcinatos: 50/50 :tf:
[1:23:47] theslothyone: where is my "Don't care" option :(
[1:23:47] rawaneoo: u shold have i do not care option too:p
[1:23:47] zeefen: HUH
[1:23:52] kurtkewlkw: Lol @ 50
[1:23:54] chickenwienersoup: open on day 1 is a great idea, dangling the apple in front of everyone
[1:23:55] boomervictim: is this a react only Stream today?
[1:23:55] Syloa: one solution that could also work: make the first lockout be 7 days instead of 3. most people wont miss it then
[1:23:57] Jazminite: @Guzu - Joardee's suggestion is a good compromise - https://twitter.com/joardee/status/1747734595959951839?s=20
[1:23:59] mimic124: @theslothyone noone cares you don't  care
[1:24:02] Guzumerchmanager: @Tropicocity but they will do that regardless right ? even now in BFD you need shadow protetion pot, free action pot, other stuff to even raid even tho everyone has cleared it many times
[1:24:02] Knaxxis: by 60 we might have like 30 world buffs lol
[1:24:05] SirHeiska: @knaxxis but imagine the damage!
[1:24:06] ritter184: If they are making new content then forcing a delay let's people explore the new content
[1:24:09] Zopum: Can't vote :p bc i dont care wich they do xD
[1:24:10] theslothyone: @theslothyone you cared enough to comment on it
[1:24:12] napo1152: The only thing that bothers me about delaying is the fact that we majority will hit level cap sooner phase 2 compared to phase 1
[1:24:12] ashtaroxx: plunk ooooh shiiiiiet, that's a fattie weapon
[1:24:13] megaxbrain: it looks like he is wearing lip gloss
[1:24:15] Chlamydious: Woyer
[1:24:21] CurleeQ: I think i may be a silent a minority who doesn't care either way
[1:24:22] mimic124: FirstTimeChatter
[1:24:24] TrueNosus: im happy they are delaying cause i dont like id rather take the time to level and enjoy 40 a bit before jumping
[1:24:24] flowerpew: staff of jordan BenniesAndy
[1:24:24] Knaxxis: literally pr-bis till 60
[1:24:28] aronfolmer: aronfolmer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months, currently on a 50 month streak! 
[1:24:28] StreamElements: aronfolmer just subscribed for 50 months in a row PogChamp
[1:24:29] Tbiz87: why delay? if people can lvl and get a group together let the go
[1:24:33] positive_ions: Staff of Jordan more melee dmg
[1:24:35] VampLUL: SoJ is a melee wpn!
[1:24:37] HappyPorcupine: I just hope that they make Gnomer a bit harder.
[1:24:38] 3Brick_: I HATE THAT STAFF Smadge
[1:24:39] Trexbo_: Staff of Jordan is now warrior weapon pogg
[1:24:41] xSmidsy: Hello all
[1:24:42] Guzumerchmanager: i just dont understand the "oh us little guys cant enjoy our 1 lvl a day when the tryhards can blast to lvl 40 in 20 hours and do the raid that we are looking forward to" so thefore we force everoyne to wait 1 week
[1:24:47] Schlecktorr: jordan is bis for warr
[1:24:49] ashtaroxx: it's massive
[1:24:51] Knaxxis: hit?
[1:24:51] NeverKrowsBest: war gear is broken
[1:24:51] xSmidsy: $cookie
[1:24:51] Supibot: xsmidsy, Your daily cookie: Everything will now come your way.
[1:24:53] 3Brick_: I HATE THAT STAFF Smadge 󠀀
[1:24:56] ashtaroxx: plunk delete anything on sight
[1:24:56] Guzumerchmanager: oh well wcyd
[1:24:57] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:25:09] Arcinatos: cant wait for warriors to do naxx 25 man dps FeelsStrongMan
[1:25:14] Blufootgaming: Chat L'
[1:25:17] HappyPorcupine: Druid staff is insane aswell
[1:25:23] Sunderwire_: i wanna see the sweat NO DELAY
[1:25:23] Locoleet: artemis cowl got crazy stats
[1:25:30] ofragdhat: it doesnt hurt anyone if i try hard and they dont
[1:25:30] bigsugg: how are people will call gnomer in LFG?  lfg GG?
[1:25:32] Tropicocity: @Method_Quando Right that's true, but considering 25-40 will definitely take longer than 1-25, the extra week delay means those who dont have 5-10 hours a day to play get extra time to get there, so by the time the sweatlords get to raid there will be more people available to pug, people will have had mroe time to farm recipes and mats and etc
[1:25:37] Jazminite: @Guzu - Joardee's suggestion is a good compromise - https://twitter.com/joardee/status/1747734595959951839?s=20
[1:25:41] ramjack13: yeah like the gnomer gear is mostliky almost like normal classic lvl 60 gear
[1:25:44] Somra: they think level 40 won't take one minute SURE
[1:25:52] Ebsoni: @guzu staysafes chat was 90% delay
[1:25:57] Trexbo_: HUH
[1:25:59] Guzumerchmanager: @Tropicocity i wont even be able to paly myself in feb due to job, but it just tilt me that people control how others want to play the game
[1:26:05] ritter184: It's not even going to be 20 hours, people are going to intsa level with turn ins
[1:26:05] Trexbo_: That makes no sense om
[1:26:06] ashtaroxx: plink that's too much effort, nah
[1:26:09] Trexbo_: To me at least
[1:26:10] Blufootgaming: i think that joardee is a good compromis
[1:26:11] p5ycc: that could work
[1:26:11] flowerpew: what's the benefit ?
[1:26:12] t4pekid: whats the difference between being the first raid kill on th first day or the first day after one week
[1:26:14] boomervictim: 5 Hours of react today SADGE
[1:26:14] napo1152: I like that better
[1:26:14] Jazminite: Aggrend liked his comment
[1:26:15] Blufootgaming: but id rather #nochanges
[1:26:15] Knaxxis: staysafe is a casual gamer @Ebsoni  so ofc his chat would vote for delay
[1:26:16] EnyoHC: calling me a fomo angy
[1:26:17] Tbiz87: if anything a delay would hurt the casuals right? no one having the new gear making the raid that much harder
[1:26:17] Beriech: That's too much. Delay or don't delay
[1:26:20] aparkedcar87: Joardee just wants to raid asap
[1:26:21] HappyPorcupine: Worst of both worlds imo
[1:26:22] sorrowquin: ppl literally wining about one lockout
[1:26:23] flowerpew: just killing it faster and then waiting longer? what's the point HUH
[1:26:24] CamGG__: or just delay and the sweats can settle down for 7 whole days oh no
[1:26:25] Syloa: i like that a lot
[1:26:29] Foodlebar: meandyouhorny EnyoHC
[1:26:34] Leon81094: but casuals will miss 1 lockout how will they recover
[1:26:38] EnyoHC: @Foodlebar meandyouhorny
[1:26:38] skull_kid_aok: why delay the raid cause of slackers. why does their problem need to become my problem
[1:26:41] HappyPorcupine: ah yeah that is better
[1:26:41] Dacookiemonstah: @Guzu if you are casual, why does it matter if some1 is speedrunning the leveling and raid ? if u are casual, why would that matter to them ?, i dont get it
[1:26:43] yekeyu7: that is actually a great idea
[1:26:46] Syloa: people can still have their little race, but no one will miss the first lockout
[1:26:47] F1reline: Either do or don't, this is a weird compromise
[1:26:48] Neffehh: good solution
[1:26:52] Guzumerchmanager: Yeah that would be a good solution
[1:26:54] zartuus: in the end only those that get lvl 40 in 2 days will have to wait. Every casual will not be lvl 40 in one week anyway i think
[1:26:54] HappyPorcupine: Yup that is a good idea
[1:26:58] Knaxxis: its not fair to the ppl that wanna go hard
[1:27:01] ghost____23: this is a good take
[1:27:02] Arcinatos: fomo just has a chokehold on people
[1:27:05] gazargh: blizz doing the sweats a favour, its healthier for them if they delay the game :D
[1:27:07] xx42oxx: how is this such a big thing, i dont understand..
[1:27:11] Ebsoni: @knaxxis yeah very true
[1:27:15] Tropicocity: i LOOOVEEE the 3 day lockout tbh, so freaking nice
[1:27:16] CamGG__: Because every lockout you miss lets the gatekeepers move the goalposts to what is required to pug
[1:27:16] Curtsy: It doesn't matter but they think it matters and perception matters in a lot in retention numbers
[1:27:18] danthechieftan: "not fair" lmao
[1:27:19] HeisyTV: It's not fair BabyRage
[1:27:19] Trexbo_: YEP It's an attempt at a comprimise, but the problem with comprimise is that you have to try and please both opposites, which will always benefit someone a little more than the other
[1:27:20] skull_kid_aok: It makes zero sense to delay the raid. There has gotta be a difference somewhere
[1:27:20] xx42oxx: just gfo hard one week later
[1:27:24] chickenwienersoup: like they won't level alt waiting
[1:27:27] Knaxxis: like im ina  sweaty guild and we all wanna rush to gnomer as fast as possible
[1:27:27] peltsiii95: but why do you have to go hard
[1:27:27] Tropicocity: GIGACHAD WHIRLWIND AXE.
[1:27:29] lanlock1: Tssk life isnt fair
[1:27:35] SkuggeMatsi: I mean, wasn't SOD made for casuals?
[1:27:38] kurtkewlkw: The purpose of SOD is to have to wait to get new things
[1:27:41] Knaxxis: @peltsiii95  go ahrd or go home u know
[1:27:41] Infrantic: What if the runes are gatekept enough to have you hunting those the first week or two until the raid anyway?
[1:27:42] jimbonni: its not fair for the peaple whit no jobs living on govermend ssupport LOL
[1:27:45] Guzumerchmanager: @gazargh but not really right. cause they will just do alt leveling ? its not like the account get locked after they reach lvl 40 LUL and first can log in wow 1 week after

[1:27:58] Doansy: shamans will get mail thats like only upgrade gear
[1:27:59] Trexbo_: Depends if 2 hand shaman* Shruge
[1:28:00] aseoun: ha jokes on him. those epics almost never drop.   never seen the staff even drop
[1:28:01] twitchforgotmyaccount: @Trexbo_ Well, the other option is to exclusively benefit the other side.
[1:28:02] Knaxxis: @jimbonni  oh ppl who have been successful in life and have extra time ??
[1:28:03] mertnl12: Maby they give mail earlyer to hunter so they can get other gear ?
[1:28:03] gazargh: @Method_Quando humour not your strong point
[1:28:05] p5ycc: How's was Palworld Guzu i missed the stream after the your "4" man raid
[1:28:06] mikenet57: Which sucks, because my luck has sucked and I havent won any tier gear
[1:28:07] adparticular1: put bfd gear on bank -> get happy with quest gear GIGACHAD
[1:28:09] IsItDonQuixote: SM gear will replace some things
[1:28:12] crag_h: Bonebiter is defo better than Hydra
[1:28:15] Heazzly: i think 1 week delay.. so we all can discover the raid together..
[1:28:15] skull_kid_aok: delay obtainable gear in SM gear till 4 weeks cause of slackers. #logics

[1:28:28] Guzumerchmanager: @gazargh humour ? :) damn you surely have a good one
[1:28:30] Foodlebar: if people want to speedrun. take a week off then power level the day raid comes out Shruge makes no difference to anyone else
[1:28:35] Tropicocity: HAHA EQUALS D =D
[1:28:36] napo1152: were going to delay the raid when so many people will be ready to raid at 40 with current gear....
[1:28:38] Knaxxis: gnomer is gonna be a Crankfest
[1:28:38] SirHicarus: @Knaxxis Are you feeling targeted
[1:28:42] Ebsoni: @guzu heard a suggestion that they will nerf the 25lvl gear when phase2 hits. what do you think?
[1:28:44] HappyPorcupine: Nah bro who cares
[1:28:48] jimbonni: don't tink some one whit an animai profiel is successful in live LOL
[1:28:51] skull_kid_aok: delay every single thing in the game so slackers can catch up lmao
[1:28:51] F1reline: There'll be more competition to beat others at going through the whole raid. So if you're a real sweatlord, the challenge still remains
[1:28:52] NeverKrowsBest: GIVE US NEW SM GEAR
[1:28:55] pproffit: no power creep
[1:28:55] Sunderwire_: its only 15 levels it’ll be quick lol

[1:28:56] ashtaroxx: plunk we'll have retail level
[1:28:57] Syloa: remove all bfd gear weve gotten YEP
[1:29:02] HappyPorcupine: You are at 40 in no time
[1:29:03] sexylegs9: Not everyone is raiding BFD on lockout.
[1:29:10] ashtaroxx: plink nah man
[1:29:10] ritter184: Naxx DPS in ZF lets gooooo
[1:29:12] twitchforgotmyaccount: It's not power creep if it's still worse or on par with Gnomer gear.
[1:29:13] HappyPorcupine: dear god no
[1:29:13] doordawg: make the BFD gear that we earned still mean something
[1:29:15] boomervictim: 5 Hours of react today SADGE  󠀀
[1:29:26] imvecks: Why would he even suggest that? Opposite of based
[1:29:30] HeisyTV: Just let people blast with their aquired gear. It's not a problem.

[1:29:31] 3Brick_: True LULW
[1:29:32] Kissifrotz: Just delete all characters and everyone starts new
[1:29:33] aseoun: people will be 4-5 manning bfd still for the epics in p2
[1:29:34] Beriech: They fix this by removing BFD lockout once p2 launches...grind it, get xp, get pre-bis. GG all happy
[1:29:36] sinzuul_: im still only level 20...
[1:29:36] Fudge_Nuggets: I havent done any BFD. Have 4 25's
[1:29:39] Sunderwire_: power creep is real
[1:29:41] Tropicocity: @sexylegs9 And here I am doing it 5x per lockout with my level 23 warlock being the only one keeping me from 8/8 om
[1:29:42] DucktorLarsen: depends on if you have played several a characters, but only raided on a few of them.
[1:29:46] twitchforgotmyaccount: Like, currently there are like four relevant pieces of dungeon gear before BFD
[1:29:46] Foodlebar: BLABBERING
[1:29:46] defensivepsycho8831: you & 1 other are the only reasons i still have hope for WOW. every time i see your vids pop-up, i watch it asap
[1:29:47] Houtss: i have 0 BFD gear cause ive only ran it once
[1:29:48] hekalaios: i have none
[1:29:48] snoopy239: People always replace loot going from MC to BWL, how is BFD to Gnomer any different? @Guzu
[1:29:50] p5ycc: well at till we go to MC the gear should be changed to higher quality really its impossible to get upgrades if u keep it the same
[1:29:51] kheetor: BFD loot is so absurd that rest of the SoD gear progression is screwed, or they will need to buff everything at 40 and probably again at 60
[1:29:51] mrbluesky1337: shoutout to my grandma
[1:29:52] crabattack12: I never done BFD w
[1:29:53] Foodlebar: how many times can he ask for ideas

[1:30:51] Codratz: 3 hunters / server?
[1:30:56] NeverKrowsBest: At lower rep levels not so bad but they def should implement somthing like that for higher level grinds
[1:30:57] Iol69: we should turn hunters into fairys who gather mushrooms
[1:30:57] BoonesHQ: 3 per server lol
[1:30:59] bluntsamurai98: for a second i thought i watching yt but guzu just pauses a lot lmao
[1:31:00] crabattack12: If you fill the box, they are not unique and you can carry another
[1:31:02] p5ycc: cant w8 to see the new RUNES OH MY GOD
[1:31:08] EnyoHC: Rune of the Gaze Gayge
[1:31:09] kheetor: 3 hunter cap per faction per realm
[1:31:09] Djinx_o: and if you dont go back immediately, 3 more will drop with in the next 5 min
[1:31:10] twitchforgotmyaccount: @savagesap Yea but at that point you can just return it. 95% of the time you have to fill it via the AH anyway

[1:31:23] HeisyTV: Kapp ?
[1:31:25] flowerpew: BY THE LOA
[1:31:26] bigbcoppa: yeah it is annoying. take it one by one
[1:31:37] xodo1313: people dont like "upgrading" thier raid gear with quest items and dungeons on a new expansion anyway.  It's sort of the same thing.  Just level and get to the "endgame"
[1:31:39] hushbang: Thats a Jnr lvl tache ... mymnas got there
[1:31:44] huckleson: easily the most braindead stupid thing they have done
[1:31:50] twitchforgotmyaccount: Problem is that people just don't run back to the city, and then they feel shafted when inevitably more boxes drop immediately.
[1:31:50] HappyPorcupine: Yeah it is so anoying
[1:31:52] ghost____23: delay gnomer till 2027
[1:31:53] huckleson: why do they think carrying crates 1 at a time is good game design?
[1:31:54] adparticular1: for the love of elune BatChest

[1:32:22] Iol69: the rep and gold grinds were kind of shoddy
[1:32:26] Cjpriest: they should just increase the rep gain from the boxes because that shit is stupid

[1:33:07] hushbang: @Wreckdem52 where are his family and friends ? maybe he doesnt have a mirror?
[1:33:07] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: but they have so high drop rate so it would be so fast getting the rep up
[1:33:11] Iol69: the other one literally being a gold grind is very bland as well
[1:33:15] hisokayohh: For the developers: nerf hunters
[1:33:15] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: prob why they are unique
[1:33:18] kheetor: I feel like if it was (3), people would argue for (10) LUL
[1:33:26] CamGG__: no legendary pls
[1:33:29] chickenwienersoup: yeah! legendary for classic retail
[1:33:31] twitchforgotmyaccount: 100% chance that the void-touched questline continues in later phases.
[1:33:31] Mezegis: why not just do rep quests like in later xpacs, have us go attack supply lines or loots items from something
[1:33:32] Foodlebar: legendary in a seasonal server AINTNOWAY

[1:34:05] Supertoast64: I think they're suggesting it's a progressive quest chain ending at 60
[1:34:05] HappyPorcupine: He is saying 60
[1:34:05] gorfang: Everyone will have it...
[1:34:06] DashKT: He isnt saying for 40
[1:34:07] bluntsamurai98: they were saying 60
[1:34:07] p5ycc: Ashbringer should be in Classic wow imo but for 60lvl yeah
[1:34:08] elendo: well, we got epics at 25, so now we need legendary at 40
[1:34:08] sighdonia: Why does the number matter? 40 or 60? It's all "end game"
[1:34:09] Farmers1: i dont want everyuone to have legendaries
[1:34:09] ritter184: An epic item at low levels is a legendary

[1:37:44] bletso: guzuBeliever lvl weapon skill
[1:37:44] aseoun: warriors need to learn how many APM they need on devestate to parse
[1:37:47] LuminescentLlama: hard like thiss ?
[1:37:47] HappyPorcupine: Not every class has an easy rotation
[1:37:49] Bishox: At 40-50 -60 it could be a harder rotation
[1:37:50] mrbluesky1337: TARGET DUMMYS SUCK I DISAGREE MR POKEMON TRAINIER
[1:37:52] mrbluesky1337: caps
[1:37:56] Knaxxis: @thegreyghost32  not the same at all
[1:37:57] Syloa: most advanced warrior rotation in all of classics history om
[1:38:02] hypnoidal: Class war has begone
[1:38:05] HappyPorcupine: Hybrid tax is dumb
[1:38:06] Cjpriest: TRUE
[1:38:08] Foodlebar: BLABBERING
[1:38:09] EasyZeee: truuuuuuuuuu
[1:38:11] gazargh: @mrbluesky1337 LUL
[1:38:11] sweatygewch: in this theory hunter should be #1 overall
[1:38:11] imvecks: Cringe
[1:38:12] thegreyghost32: Agreed
[1:38:15] Petrichorx_x: BLABBERING
[1:38:17] Tropicocity: but shaman dps sucks and druid tanking sucks!??
[1:38:18] Iol69: hold up. like hunters being the only dps only class
[1:38:20] bletso: hmmMeeting
[1:38:21] xcharles_: HUHA
[1:38:24] shmokindoink: nah thats a shit take
[1:38:25] SirHicarus: Dumb
[1:38:25] Trexbo_: Tf? Priest can dps too??? Smadge
[1:38:27] crvyxn: that's the point of the talent tree
[1:38:28] Jalapinot: Except mages can damage, shield, root, slow, etc etc etc
[1:38:29] thegreyghost32: Fucking druids & shamans 😋
[1:38:31] Cjpriest: hybrid classes should NEVER be as good as a pure spec class
[1:38:31] HeisyTV: Warrior PepeLa
[1:38:31] Petrichorx_x: priest is a dps class also tho iAsk
[1:38:31] ObsidianHealer: yep
[1:38:32] hylzan: He’s wrong here
[1:38:32] fwankey: NOIDONTTHINKSO
[1:38:34] chickenwienersoup: coughs in sp
[1:38:35] DashKT: Bad take
[1:38:35] HeyRaynor: DODGE AGAIN
[1:38:38] ttv_yoohooclips: DRUIDS
[1:38:39] brownfiesta: Bruh, there are specs for a reason.
[1:38:40] mikenet57: Yah exactly
[1:38:40] Rahmulous: Warrior… you literally sword and boarded the 4 man BFD and topped dps though.
[1:38:46] shmokindoink: shit comment
[1:38:49] LuminescentLlama: spec into THIS
[1:38:49] HeisyTV: OMEGALUL
[1:38:50] ashtaroxx: plunk you spec into a tank and dps at the same time as warrior
[1:38:51] Iol69: hunter being the only dps ONLY class in wow specing into BEAST MASTERY
[1:38:51] flowerpew: Skateparkge class that can heal shouldn't be allowed to be viable
[1:38:52] ObsidianHealer: om
[1:38:53] hugogaraujo: ppl want to play retail with  classic skin
[1:38:54] Syloa: a spriest doing half the dmg of a hunter is insane
[1:38:56] HappyPorcupine: At the end of the day warrior and rogues will always be top dps anyway
[1:39:00] rel_hunyad: i mean take druids , jack of all trades master of nothing , isnt that good ? @Guzu
[1:39:05] imvecks: Healing can be the equivlient of CC, so Yes a shaman can do good damage AND heal, but a rogue can do good damage AND CC, I think this is a silly point
[1:39:08] imvecks: it's not everquest
[1:39:09] Trexbo_: It'd be one thing if Enhancement shaman could spend Malestorm on off healing or I guess what Fury of Stormrage does in SoD om
[1:39:11] Foodlebar: so are they saying a druid should be bad at everything
[1:39:13] mrbluesky1337: is he even 20 years old? LUL
[1:39:14] Knaxxis: should warrior be the top again after 0 years of being the best?
[1:39:18] Knaxxis: 20
[1:39:19] flowerpew: ABOZO : shaman can heal so they aren't dps
[1:39:23] hushbang: thats the points of Talents - a hybrid class CANNOT be HIGH DPS and BEST tank
[1:39:26] twitchforgotmyaccount: Hybrid tax OMEGALUL
[1:39:26] backstreetalright: 20 years is too much
[1:39:28] HeisyTV: NERF HUNTER Madge
[1:39:29] Jalapinot: Rets dont heal in raids. I hate this argument
[1:39:31] Jahesch: really bad take from him
[1:39:31] Bishox: LUL
[1:39:33] twitchuser2016: well thats how classic was tho?
[1:39:34] Jazminite: @mrbluesky1337 I was thinking the same thing LuL
[1:39:34] Syloa: exactly, bad take
[1:39:34] ashtaroxx: that was paladin in classic except for healing
[1:39:36] Petrichorx_x: jack of all trades and a master of none YEP
[1:39:40] Tropicocity: wild growth is amazing though
[1:39:42] foxxbraid: That's why druids get thrown out of raids at 60
[1:39:43] imvecks: make everything OP it its own unique way like MOP, legit
[1:39:43] Guzumerchmanager: yebut should a druid dps be better than a rogue ? @Guzu since the rogue can only provide dmg
[1:39:44] mrbluesky1337: @Jazminite TwitchConHYPE
[1:39:50] chickenwienersoup: maybe paladins can dps
[1:39:51] Beriech: That's what talents are for...if I spend all my talents on feral dps I will suck at healing or even tanking tbh
[1:39:53] Knaxxis: play anything but warrior at lvl 60 and try to get into naxxramas
[1:39:55] sxtwn: shadow priest ruin this in p2
[1:39:55] Iol69: omg but everyone very quick to demand nerf on the only dps only class
[1:39:56] SkuggeMatsi: I'd say buff whatever they are talented into, but if they use spells for another spec it costs more and works worse?
[1:39:56] MadCaptainDuck: Hunter the only pure dps now so they should be only viable dps
[1:39:56] HappyPorcupine: I'd rather not be shit at everything
[1:39:57] Numline123: bad words D:
[1:39:57] itsdynabro: are warriors not classed as hybrid then? the best dps and tanks :S
[1:39:57] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:40:01] Hylaren: YEP 💩
[1:40:01] Iol69: omg but everyone very quick to demand nerf on the only dps only class.
[1:40:01] didgeridoo1001: Warlock,Mage,Rogue,Hunter only
[1:40:03] Nunadaaa: so hiii chat how are you
[1:40:04] regularpers: true, make feral dps top dps
[1:40:05] HappyPorcupine: That is how it was in classic
[1:40:05] Mahca_: that comment treats it as if the druid can just freely swap between tank, dps and heal on the fly
[1:40:05] Supertoast64: I think he's saying make it viable but not OP/on top
[1:40:07] hypnoidal: He is a hybrid. Half moron half idiot.
[1:40:09] Foodlebar: meandyouhorny Nunadaaa
[1:40:09] Jalapinot: Feral druids don't pop out of form to heal. This argument is so silly
[1:40:09] Cavrz: why bring a non hybrid then
[1:40:10] clootz: why even play the classes then lmao
[1:40:16] flowerpew: rogue should be bottom DPS cause they provide CC ABOZO same logic
[1:40:16] Aishea26: with this logic, every class is able to do atleast 2 roles now in SoD (dps tank or heal) but not the hunters
[1:40:18] Syloa: here come the people saying: just play whats fun, it doesnt matter how much dmg you do Nerdge
[1:40:21] HappyPorcupine: In classic druid healer was the only viable spec
[1:40:22] LuminescentLlama: parr thiss
[1:40:23] Iol69: omg but everyone very quick to demand nerf on the only dps only class?
[1:40:23] Curtsy: Yeah people drop the hybrid tax thing very quickly when you bring warriors into the conversation
[1:40:24] Drazimo: Most classes with Runes are now Hybrids.
[1:40:26] nonchfriend: maqluba , biryani , baba ganoush
[1:40:28] elthegart: balance druid pvp is op
[1:40:28] SkuggeMatsi: Buffs Kappa
[1:40:34] foolsendit: @Aishea26 hunters pets raid tank lmao
[1:40:34] Syloa: to not waste loot for example
[1:40:35] p5ycc: Feral druid at lvl 40 is the important thing to bring into raids Guzu. Innervate, Combat ress, power shift tank, windfury
[1:40:35] Trexbo_: Just bring all warriors Shruge
[1:40:35] hushbang: good talent tree will make this argument redundant
[1:40:37] twitchforgotmyaccount: The fear was that people would only play the hybrid classes, but when they got rid of the tax, nothing changed.
[1:40:37] Curtsy: warriors are hybrids and nobody whines about them really
[1:40:38] jazzifist: so many hybrid haters in wow
[1:40:38] Cjpriest: thats his point is they SHOULDNT be on par or better than PURE dps classes ya know? not making them awful but they shouldnt out perform pure classes
[1:40:39] Knaxxis: @Guzu  at 60 ull see the 24 warrior stack meta
[1:40:39] Denat0: @SkuggeMatsi said it best...BUFFS
[1:40:40] idilly20: warlocks tank dps and heal themselves in sod lol
[1:40:43] hsayus123: they should give rogues some kind of raid buff ability with runes
[1:40:44] Nunadaaa: WHAT
[1:40:44] Nunadaaa: NO
[1:40:47] Nunadaaa: THEY SHOUOLD BE TOPPING
[1:40:49] Infrantic: Guess what class is NOT a hybrid in SOD?
[1:40:50] ritter184: If they are on par, they don't get invited @guzu we saw this in TBC and WotLK as rogues >.>
[1:40:51] mrbluesky1337: dont forget to hybrid lmao
[1:40:52] Mezegis: yep, 10 man shaman groups are definitely not a thing
[1:40:55] Trexbo_: fricc this take Smadge
[1:40:56] Nunadaaa: shut up person, enhancement superiority
[1:40:56] Syzlak3: feral is just dmg not like u gona heal in raid they are basicly pure dmg
[1:40:57] Nunadaaa: shut up person, enhancement superiority 󠀀
[1:40:57] Mahca_: the only pure dps class now is hunter too
[1:40:58] Bishox: @cjpriest why would you ever bring hybrids then ?
[1:40:59] Iol69: hunter the only class left that is pure dps and everyone mad at them for being #3 in dps
[1:40:59] Nunadaaa: fricc
[1:40:59] flowerpew: why not
[1:41:00] bletso: POGGERS utility
[1:41:00] ashtaroxx: nerf hunters
[1:41:01] napo1152: dude casually ignores warriors at the top
[1:41:05] Knaxxis: 20-25 warrior stack meta is all ur gonna see at 60
[1:41:06] Syloa: hes stating it like its a fact. ffs
[1:41:07] brownfiesta: That was a stupid comment. L take
[1:41:08] shogun2255: paladins will top meters when they get Wings
[1:41:08] aullywow: L take AINTNOWAY
[1:41:12] HappyPorcupine: @p5ycc lol I am going to innervate myself every time LUL
[1:41:13] clootz: I'm saying people who want hybrid tax are just not right
[1:41:15] HeisyTV: ESFAND ENJOYERS ICANT
[1:41:18] Jalapinot: Hunters bring utility too. Ugh this is stupid
[1:41:18] Krookedz: @hsayus123 ye i think rogues might get honor among thieves
[1:41:19] thegreyghost32: As an old school Spriest main I totally feel the "utility" class
[1:41:20] SirKalikan: lmao, wut? This dude doesn't remember the hybrid tax era.
[1:41:20] ashtaroxx: plunk ret pally has 20 buffs man
[1:41:22] Curtsy: @Cjpriest Okay then we better nerf warrior dps by 65% then, they are a hybrid class
[1:41:24] shmokindoink: i dont think this guy is great for the wow community. Chat what do u think?
[1:41:26] Trexbo_: YEAH BUT ITS PASSIVE
[1:41:26] nonchfriend: is paladin weak in classic wow?

[1:41:41] ohioliving: what the hell is that on his lip pepePoint
[1:41:42] twitchforgotmyaccount: huh
[1:41:45] Trexbo_: THEY SHOULD DEAL LESS DAMAGE
[1:41:45] Petrichorx_x: NOPERS no one cares about yout utility in raids
[1:41:47] Curtsy: @fatassdoinkz I think you're thinking too much about this and need to lighten up
[1:41:48] imvecks: Feels like a retail Andy playing SOD ngl
[1:41:49] Knaxxis: how do u avoid the 20 warrior stack meta
[1:41:50] Foodlebar: bad take
[1:41:50] Mahca_: hybrid tax is acting like the hybrids can tank, heal dps at the same time np
[1:41:51] huckleson: It doesfeel like this guy doesnt play wow lmfao
[1:41:53] echoloch: the meta tho is to pump so hard that none of the utility is needed
[1:41:53] wisenot: the best utility is dpsing mechanics away from a boss LUL
[1:41:56] clootz: ya utility totally need all that for the 40 second fights
[1:41:56] TrebekTv: community manager lance
[1:41:56] Trexbo_: AND SUNDER ARMOR
[1:41:57] Jalapinot: There should not be a hybrid tax, its stupid. DPS roles don't heal in raids
[1:41:58] Trexbo_: ICANT
[1:41:58] gorfang: Ele shaman will top the meters next phase mark my words
[1:42:01] Cjpriest: @Bishox to bring the utility they offer. buffs, totems, healing stuff like that. Im not saying i agree or disagree im highlighting his point...
[1:42:03] bletso: VeryPog
[1:42:03] Guzumerchmanager: @imvecks yep but that is prob alot of the overall Sod Playerbase
[1:42:04] hiusmuotoilu1: warriors are hybrids also so how are they allowed to be top dps and tank :)
[1:42:04] hushbang: HOLYI priets should lead dmg nd heals every raid
[1:42:05] ashtaroxx: it is what it is
[1:42:06] huckleson: @gorfang no they wont lol
[1:42:08] ashtaroxx: plunk oooh yeah
[1:42:08] shmokindoink: @Curtsy no valuable input LMAO thanks bro
[1:42:09] HappyPorcupine: You need 1 feral with every warrior group
[1:42:09] ghost____23: nerf deepwounds
[1:42:09] Yeddamand: Always found these arguments to be really stupid. Most people choose the class they enjoy the class fantasy of the most, they should be able to perform well in the niche that you spec them
[1:42:10] mcboonee: nerf warrior
[1:42:11] Syloa: just nerf hunters, fixes all problems
[1:42:11] danielfoolo: thats the dumbest thing i ever heard in wow
[1:42:12] huckleson: @gorfang boomkin might
[1:42:12] Knaxxis: then its the same as era lol
[1:42:13] Dracconfoo: smoRC AS THEY SHULD
[1:42:13] Addrid: COPIUM
[1:42:14] YermGames: no they will nerf them to the ground
[1:42:15] Supertoast64: not on horde bc they can't be seen ina  group together
[1:42:15] Addrid: NERF WARRIORS
[1:42:15] Curtsy: warriors are hybrids and not a single person wants to hybrid tax them in this conversation KEKW @Guzu
[1:42:17] honeybun400: W warrior
[1:42:18] Muffufu: Nerf Hunters!
[1:42:18] ritter184: When they buffed ferals in WotLK, all the rogues got cut except for 1 combat....
[1:42:19] Iol69: hunter is only pure dps class and people still want nerf when they are third in pve
[1:42:20] Foodlebar: @huckleson feels like he picks popular comments and agrees with them regardless of what it says
[1:42:20] ashtaroxx: warrior best tank best dps best healer best class best fantasy ggs
[1:42:21] zak618: warrior got zero nerfs while also being top dps lol
[1:42:21] Jahesch: Utility has never and will never make a class feel great to play. The utility just feels good for the other classes profiting. Like no shaman enjoyed being nothing but a wf bitch for warriors as enhance
[1:42:21] chickenwienersoup: they gonna be zipping around with 2 1h
[1:42:23] Trexbo_: Holy that take was such a surface level take om
[1:42:24] Guzumerchmanager: @mcboonee weird way to type hunter 4Head
[1:42:25] Curtsy: @fatassdoinkz Okay you're clearly a child KEKW
[1:42:26] Dracconfoo: GIGACHAD

[1:42:32] HappyPorcupine: Most classes just don't scale
[1:42:34] Geartrix: rage and energy are infinitely better than mana melee
[1:42:36] NotDeFow: if warriors are the best dps they really need to nerf hunters Kappa
[1:42:37] SkuggeMatsi: Never nerf Warriors, they deserve to be good PVE when they can so easily be kited PVP
[1:42:41] Curtsy: Better hybrid tax warriors then :)
[1:42:45] ashtaroxx: you get more dopamine plink
[1:42:46] Vanathor: scaling is easy to nerf and expected at this point
[1:42:47] Cjpriest: @Bishox im not saying make hybrid classes shit im saying they shouldnt be higher than a pure dps class. i play hybrid classes almost exclusively and im not mad about it
[1:42:50] rel_hunyad: i mean thats the whole warrior thing , bad gear = bad dmg , good gear =good dmg
[1:42:51] SlapdickWoWplayer: I'm jsut waiting for a caster warrior
[1:42:51] Nunadaaa: no
[1:42:58] Colddaylight: No.. it was not
[1:42:58] evildufus: Let's take a look at the mak gora tourney, who was at the end? Lock and spriest

[1:47:51] LuminescentLlama: scam* lol
[1:47:53] Mahca_: @Cjpriest thats true but if were talking about role then shaman and druid healers are only expected to heal, so are they pure healer then?
[1:47:55] mordiell: no one wanted to do it so i made bank

[1:48:22] Arthident: "farmed"
[1:48:22] Cjpriest: @Mahca_ if their role is healing only then sure but they do dps in their off time but its not required
[1:48:24] Rahmulous: OM
[1:48:24] twitchforgotmyaccount: @Cjpriest Yeah but you're not most people lmao. "Hybrid tax" as a term was a point of contention for its entire period of relevance. Also see this conversation. Most people just don't like being "taxed" for just playing their fav class.

[2:05:13] BoonesHQ: @CentaurFire right
[2:05:14] Morningscraps: You gotta network Guzu!
[2:05:18] Xeronismm: @Guzu how will gnomes farm essence of undeath for the deathray?

[2:06:13] lolitsjoseph: worth playing wow at this moment?
[2:06:14] bluntsamurai98: I played valheim for a bit it was fun
[2:06:14] Rahmulous: @drishx Liquid is a group of friends who love playing together. Echo is the best EU gamers slammed together into a room with little knowledge of each other. there is zero chemistry because they’re basically strangers
[2:06:17] TheGreattDane: Valheim server??

[3:01:27] wreckstormx: @grumpy_dane then there wouldnt be any point ever to farm gear

[3:10:11] Rahmulous: Already well over halfway through the stream and hasn’t touched palworld
[3:10:19] Knaxxis: chat has to udnerstand that this is just a filler game till phase 2 its not a new main game
[3:10:22] Curtsy: its a survival base building game, of course its more like ark
[3:10:23] smorgo32: Ark is terrible
[3:10:28] grimmdoom: I miss pixel looking monsters Sadge
[3:10:28] Ceodewd: Ark is very enjoyable, especially with friends and guilds
[3:10:30] Porkypine666: its fortnite pokemon

[3:10:33] CamGG__: @smorgo32 ARk is amazing
[3:10:35] Trexbo_: You haven't even gotten to the gun part

[3:10:42] LuminescentLlama: more like spears and bows + pokemon
[3:10:42] pointlesszerg: When will we see your OSRS main account Guzu?
[3:10:45] flowerpew: @Knaxxis it's a new main game just like valheim COPIUMSHIPMENT
[3:10:46] TheEndIsNear777: GUGU
[3:10:46] Modebc: HeadBanger
[3:10:46] Steamro11r: Ark has same surv elements and u tame dinos and ride them and can put guns and stuff on them
[3:10:51] LuminescentLlama: guguJAM
[3:10:54] Texie2k: chat did he raid today?
[3:10:55] Fujinator: @Guzu have you seen Enshrouded? it gets released tomorrow and looks more like an improved version of valheim
[3:11:00] NeverKrowsBest: apperently guns don't become available till level 20
[3:11:02] DamDamPew: You really got the most dead layer lol
[3:11:05] p5ycc: i guess ppl using winning layer get rep fast and then jump into another for more rep?
[3:11:06] Rahmulous: Alarm only one hour left to stream, palworld or no? Alarm
[3:11:06] Trexbo_: I feel like the gun part is maybe a bit unfitting but maybe it makes sense when you get there Shruge

[3:11:21] Modebc: song guz?
[3:11:21] draqcula: nope the alliances one for ranged sucks
[3:11:25] Iol69: people are obsessed with comparing the game to other things but they wont admit its popular with 1.7m concurrent players
[3:11:26] Curtsy: it doesnt
[3:11:29] NeverKrowsBest: why are the ally ones easier?
[3:11:33] Texie2k: You cant layer jump
[3:11:35] Curtsy: the game isnt made to make ense its made to make money
[3:11:39] Knaxxis: cant do that anymore was a thing u could week 1 or 2 lol
[3:11:40] LuminescentLlama: \..|/   (  O _  O   )   \|../
[3:11:41] Ceodewd: Tbh, what saved Ark was the insane good mod community
[3:11:44] geennaamnl1: Yep I did it yesterday , I didnt mean to but once I left group I entered another layer and did it agane
[3:11:50] firepoooop: @Modebc i think this is skillet
[3:11:50] CamGG__: @Iol69 its good because its like other good games tho. its not pure innovation.
[3:11:52] Knaxxis: i mean sod has like millions of players as well
[3:11:53] Steamro11r: people love pokemon and shooters
[3:11:58] Knaxxis: believe it or not the numbers r there
[3:12:02] Curtsy: People love survival games, they always become popular for a time
[3:12:04] 21bender21: The devs say they put in guns cuz they know Americans like shooting things
[3:12:05] SirHeiska: Devs said they added guns because americans like shooting.
[3:12:18] geennaamnl1: Watch guzu become a party animal main
[3:12:18] flowerpew: popular = good OkayChamping
[3:12:21] Knaxxis: as soon as phase 2 launches the millions will be back
[3:12:25] Iol69: @ItsCamGG its not new, its not unique, its not groundbreaking. but its fun af for what it is and a great time passer
[3:12:27] Steamro11r: 5 mill copies sold in 3 days
[3:12:27] Trexbo_: Yeah chat look at SoDs million players in Guzu's raid right now om

[3:12:46] TheEndIsNear777: @Trexbo_ omg there's so many MILLIONS :p
[3:12:49] Knaxxis: il say it again when tthe gasming drought is this bad ANYTHING decent is gonna do very well
[3:12:52] Knaxxis: its not rocket science
[3:13:05] Fink108: nintendo gonna sue tf out of the p eople making those actual pokemon mods KEKW
[3:13:06] Rahmulous: The gun part is potentially something Nintendo can sue over. Because of the closeness in art, they have an argument that the guns will confuse people into believing Pokémon condones guns and hurt their image. It’s an interesting legal issue
[3:13:08] NeverKrowsBest: run to BF
[3:13:11] raiwist: dont like a game that i dont like or im going straight to reddit
[3:13:12] LuminescentLlama: jube the falsehellscream
[3:13:13] Ceodewd: SkuggeMatsi sadly that is what 98% of people think

[3:13:23] anosstwitch: comparing this to your horse character in ashenvale… that whirlwind is stupid as hell
[3:13:24] Knaxxis: literally darka nd darker had the same blow up
[3:13:26] NeverKrowsBest: NAW YOU'LL MAKE IT
[3:13:27] CamGG__: @Iol69 oh absolutely ive played like 30hrs now, but imo its so fun because it takes what other survival games did well. and the QoL features are great. Crafting from containers, pals doing item management, incredible.
[3:13:27] firepoooop: bro is this Dead by April ???
[3:13:29] Knaxxis: its just a gaming drought
[3:13:32] NeverKrowsBest: Go get the tag
[3:13:38] flowerpew: Guzu you're playing an unpopular game right now, look at your layer dawg ICANT
[3:13:39] RushedFuq: I'ma say for early acces i think palworld looks VERY promising! the key point is how developement is going forward after those huge sales ususally thats the point where devs stop caring bc they already sold..really hope this is not the case
[3:13:41] stuffe92: just mount up TwitchConHYPE
[3:13:46] NeverKrowsBest: You'll be fine
[3:13:48] Texie2k: beg for a summon
[3:13:48] melvinguyy: dead by april damn thats some nostalgia
[3:13:51] Foodlebar: ppRun
[3:13:54] firepoooop: holy moly i havent listened too them in forever. i love it
[3:13:56] Woah_Zerk: Best place to visit in Denmark?
[3:14:03] twitchforgotmyaccount: @Rahmulous That makes zero sense. Making a game less like established IP shouldn't possibly make it easier to argue the case.
