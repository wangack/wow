[5:02:24] Metaphix: i have a palmetto state they are cheaper but great
[5:02:28] Atb50: They’re probably on par with a cult, the best they are on the market as a Daniel defense
[5:02:28] ccnn24: @Zarlus nah that shit is crazy, no one envisioned nukes when 2nd amend was drafted
[5:02:29] r0ger_this: sig is solid
[5:02:33] kizhuk: sigaur?
[5:02:34] ASoullessZebra: Palmetto state armory is the best cheap option out there
[5:02:35] EarSlug: sigs are nice
[5:02:38] TurboBased: that sig is nice
[5:02:40] mc2albert: Decent affordable.  I have one. Works fine.  Good 1st AR imo
[5:02:41] Arcsilin: sig is one of the best world wide
[5:02:42] Metaphix: you ever tried a sig p226 pistol?
[5:02:50] Engage_Weakness: yeah
[5:02:55] QuestFor420: yep
[5:02:57] Udenwo: screamer dropped it for me
[5:02:58] r0ger_this: get a FN Scar if youre gonna be carrying it alot theyre super light
[5:02:58] terminx: yeah its can takes ages
[5:02:59] Metaphix: its so ergonomic it's amazing
[5:03:01] Mawshaw: It's low drop chance
[5:03:01] Gabe4D: u wanna kill the casters
[5:03:02] dabby2121: yes, its any of the casters her
[5:03:06] windatar: They drop off those guys and there is another spot at the cave but those ones are higher level.
[5:03:07] Zarlus: @ccnn24 Doesnt matter the forefathers already wrote it in... NO LAW CAN BE MADE REPUGNANT TO THE CONSTITUION FOR ANY REASON
[5:03:10] PatchesMcPatch: no, you have to kill the Screamers. the caster
[5:03:13] windatar: The drop chance is super low.
[5:03:27] summerteeth: EZ true
[5:03:31] NutterCircus: You can always buy the cheapest AR and upgrade parts as you go. Its all good.
[5:03:33] Mtruck27: Mtruck27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[5:03:51] andypandynz: is AR for hunter or home defence?
[5:03:54] Metaphix: it's easy af
[5:03:55] KingQueenAce: you need to know how to
[5:03:56] HeIlraiser_: whats the point of a automatic weapon when nobody does full auto, rifle is better
[5:03:58] KingQueenAce: for cleaning and what not
[5:04:00] CookieClickerLegend: give em a solid cleanin
[5:04:00] r0ger_this: you should do that if only to grease and clean them
[5:04:01] summerteeth: it's like legos
[5:04:01] Arcsilin: @andypandynz could be both
[5:04:04] avoidedneXt: you could do a youtube tutorial on it bro

[5:04:08] CT_Wolfe: what are you trying to get?
[5:04:14] downriverdirt: do u have any handguns
[5:04:15] windatar: I killed 50 before I found mine, then I needed to kill another 30 before the shadow spawned for it.
[5:04:15] papaw4w4: it’s one pin
[5:04:26] KCYON: any risks to not disassembling ever?
[5:04:28] ccnn24: @Zarlus ya but you cant interpret that text literally, its just absurd to think a US billionaire could buy and own a 1gigaton nuke
[5:04:33] NutterCircus: YT will demonitize for assembly
[5:04:34] tepsx: where do you buy your guns from? @StaysafeTV
[5:04:37] Metaphix: @KCYON yes, you cant clean it properly

[5:05:00] DuoX: a good gun will fire after 20 years in your dresser
[5:05:00] Doribob1: i need to clean mine, thank you
[5:05:03] Arcsilin: question for chat who actually know what the AR actually stands for? lets see who knows in chat
[5:05:05] andypandynz: people calling AR's a good first one or entry level and talking about upgrading parts on it for  home defense is wild
[5:05:09] Voidbonx: and shoot with it from time to time
[5:05:10] SneakyChalupa: gachiBASS
[5:05:11] kizhuk: resale value
[5:05:21] Doribob1: @MadJacker15 yes
[5:05:23] KCYON: makes sense that seems important, i dont imagine it can injure you but better safe than sorry
[5:05:24] Metaphix: @MadJacker15 depends on what that means

[5:06:23] rothchilds: @StaysafeTV I am 100% in on BTC no joke. Get you 1 whole coin... it will change your life
[5:06:25] running_backing: BlackRock is a major BTC holder. they are going to dump it when it hits ATH
[5:06:34] papaw4w4: most people haven’t done the research to learn what BTC really is.
[5:06:41] rothchilds: 66k
[5:06:46] r0ger_this: 80 % own real estate / buy stocks & bonds, 20 % crypto
[5:06:50] CatformTV: Buy at 30k
[5:06:50] Kiangani: so it's some kind of coin?

[5:07:05] Earthspasm: just get ready for it to be flat or down after you buy, for a while
[5:07:05] liceol: I have 140 coins in a lost wallet ;)
