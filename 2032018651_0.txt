[2:28:18] mrmangasm: its COPIUM , but these players want an OSRS style for classic down the line

[2:28:23] SlapaH03: turbotard KEKL
[2:28:24] kaladhras: actually TURTLE WOW is the TRUE classic+
[2:28:25] ScarfaceCEO: My prose is the epitome of eloquence and erudition, a sublime synthesis of syntactic sophistication and semantic subtlety, a paragon of perspicacity and precision that transcends the trite and trivial tropes of the literary landscape.
[2:28:30] iBanEvader: it's big money
[2:28:32] photek_tn: 89 responses, 48 of which are mountainboi

[2:28:45] DaGreenGiant: I just enjoy watching WoW content, does it matter where it comes from?
[2:28:51] KCYON: if its not a beta test, its a test for the real thing, in a live server
[2:28:53] mrmangasm: @kaladhras yeah turtle wow has made great changes
[2:28:55] Slizzzard: SoM was a beta test for fresh servers CHANGE MY MIND
[2:28:58] gachi93: this is the second season of we've had, and they're been testing changes. what else are they doing?
[2:28:58] DaGreenGiant: Most games have "seasons"
[2:29:03] Roo1993: season of dn

[2:32:57] mrmangasm: the dev team is missing the entire point of the class design, they are making small % adjustments and doing nothing to make the specs fun or enjoyable to play
[2:33:04] iBanEvader: Blizzard is really scared to make changes to the base game
[2:33:10] dirbagdan: Good morning/evening!
[2:33:14] iBanEvader: because of community outrage

[2:34:27] nearoz123: why nerf hunters if your bringing everyone else up to their tier
[2:34:29] Leytrrr: they look pretty good compared to ERA

[2:35:14] Thxkira56k: caster loot too hard to get
[2:35:20] Fachura: You can do as much dps as u want with warrios rogues and hunters, but no one has a chance vs aff warlock in pvp
[2:35:26] TheEndIsNear777: the 2 classes with "infinite resources"
[2:35:27] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV you are right, Blizzard is too scared to make bigger changes because of community outrage
[2:35:30] cinx787: Feral is the only difference from original classic lol
[2:35:37] Roo1993: @Fachura cope harder
[2:35:42] mattykek: That's kinda how it goes tho. They scale with gear. They need more caster gear to even it out
[2:35:45] Bloodraven2488: @StaysafeTV  hunmter nerfs are for pvp is why
[2:35:46] mrmangasm: @Thxkira56k yes the loot tables in BFD are terrible and have too many gag items
[2:35:49] TPBaron: pull up classic logs
[2:35:51] IR_ish: also depends on what you're fighting
[2:35:52] Bloodraven2488: hunter*
[2:35:59] harvenius: SNIFFA
[2:36:01] IR_ish: fire mage against a fire elemtal isn't going to work
[2:36:01] Fachura: @Roo1993 wym bro? its sad truth, warlocks too op
[2:36:04] steevwtf: anyone have really shit loot this reset? fucking trash on 8 diff raids
[2:36:05] ignitar: Nerf hunters again BASED
[2:36:10] AceOfFlame: I dont get why they dont just allow INT to have  SP
[2:36:11] EnvironNA: They cant,spriest and boomy are already op in PVP so they cant buff damage
[2:36:14] snake_like: COPIUM at level 40 it'll balance out
[2:36:16] voreal22: yet they nerf hunters again lol
[2:36:18] mrmangasm: dps mage is not even viable imho

[2:36:26] mattykek: BUFF MAGE
[2:36:30] harvenius: Season of imbalance discovery
[2:36:33] whitenoise407: if Phase 2 holds true with mechanical mobs being immune to bleeds, both of those top classes will struggle
[2:36:34] mrmangasm: disagree
[2:36:36] iBanEvader: I think they don't wanna rip off the band-aid but slowly change the system over time
[2:36:37] chunky1983: resto druid is also doing 3x the dmg of the rest
[2:36:40] DaGreenGiant: If everyone could be around the Feral Druid range itd be fair.
[2:36:45] serbia_cs2: its still level 25
[2:36:49] linkitcraig: i dont spriest can ever be viable at 25
[2:36:52] jimbonni: tbh mage pomp allot of dps for a healer
[2:36:54] Tinman_VF: healer mages also do 100x more damage than other healers
[2:37:02] mrmangasm: Priest and Druids are the only classes that have viable healing runes
[2:37:03] 1304R: nerf warrior damage and there is no reason to bring them
[2:37:05] cinnamonamon: but is it the fact that melee have all their support already? As opposed to missing Wrath of Air / Spell crit buffs?
[2:37:11] TogaTig: ;)
[2:37:18] louetv: lvl 26 frostbolt rank :(
[2:37:18] JimBobJr: theyre trying to balance for pvp too, thats the source of the problem imo
[2:37:21] mrmangasm: in the dumpster
[2:37:21] Mccdowwell: DPS probably balances out more in the 40 bracket
[2:37:22] mattykek: idk about that. mages can't heal for shit
[2:37:22] DaGreenGiant: 8 boomkin. 2 priest for WSG. = win
[2:37:24] iBanEvader: it's because of wild strikes
[2:37:25] Utmost777: shaman
[2:37:25] jimbonni: LOL
[2:37:26] cinx787: Have the actually buffed the bottom 5 speccs though? I think nerfs for other OP classes are great but does it matter if underperforming classes do not receive a buff?
[2:37:26] mrmangasm: KEKW
[2:37:28] iBanEvader: that's why melee is so broken
[2:37:28] IR_ish: are we doing a youtube video ? hah
[2:37:30] sweatlordkush: IT SUCKS MAN
[2:37:32] Thxkira56k: Caster loot hard too get
[2:37:37] iscamog: healer mage is amazing though cause of its dps output
[2:37:43] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV wild strikes makes melee super strong
[2:37:45] ignitar: Good. Mage mains are cringe
[2:37:46] jimbonni: true but they bring int buff
[2:37:48] mrmangasm: Fire mage is not even viable due to major mana issues
[2:37:48] jimbonni: :D

[2:37:57] devvastate: Pog 50 gifted
[2:37:58] Ebeeyo: Mage healer is actually giga strong since you are basically a dps while healing
[2:37:59] liljbott: no shatter yet sadge
[2:38:02] IR_ish: and really the enemies you're fighting
[2:38:05] harvenius: @Mipolarization damn d00d, big dick subs
[2:38:05] Varels1: not true. their healing is damage so double value
[2:38:06] blakeshow: gifting out of his mind
[2:38:08] Zetherior: Looks like the dredded POWER BUDGET is making its way into SoD.. Sadge @StaysafeTV
[2:38:10] TPBaron: it's lvl 25
[2:38:11] mrmangasm: yes
[2:38:12] thecollector313: no.
[2:38:13] mattykek: I abandoned my mage. They are ass
[2:38:13] Mccdowwell: see again at 40
[2:38:16] Thxkira56k: no
[2:38:16] TPBaron: see what happens with more full kits
[2:38:18] whitenoise407: WAIT UNTIL P2
[2:38:19] cinnamonamon: Lets care about 40, not 25
[2:38:19] user08cc21c8: its bad because it is 25
[2:38:20] AceOfFlame: we need more gear and info with extra abilitys before an actual conclusion
[2:38:22] iBanEvader: not really a problem atm because it's only lvl 25
[2:38:23] whitenoise407: DONT CARE ABOUT IT
[2:38:26] Harles_: warriors only get stronger in vanilla they will be insane late game
[2:38:26] orcenheimer: I dont give a shit about PvE performance in the least
[2:38:27] mrmangasm: next phase will be great however
[2:38:27] Mipolarization: @harvenius <3
[2:38:28] redRAID3R: rogue should be #1
[2:38:29] TPBaron: I think lvl 40 it will matter more
[2:38:31] Joewrx: warrior is favorite child
[2:38:32] user08cc21c8: if its like this at 25 then it will be the same going forward
[2:38:36] stressedattorney: as a warrior main, they need to keep the current balance. its good. KEKW
[2:38:44] souljazz: the content is tiered so class balance should matter
[2:38:45] moonpalz: fire mages destroying all the speed run trash, carrying the rest on AoE
[2:38:48] sekuron: no, but you cant focus on only one aspect of the game (raiding)
[2:38:53] foogyjenkins: if you think it’s gonna be balanced at lvl 60 i have a bridge I’d like to sell you
[2:38:53] mrmangasm: @stressedattorney Warriors scaling KEKW
[2:38:55] Arcsilin: @user08cc21c8 they are adding more runes so probably not
[2:38:57] iBanEvader: @user08cc21c8 not necessarily
[2:38:57] whitenoise407: if Phase 2 holds true with mechanical mobs being immune to bleeds, both of those top classes will struggle
[2:38:57] sand_pump: mages are one of the most OP class tho outside of raids @StaysafeTV
[2:38:58] NicoNicoPlz: shaman dude.... both dps specs are ass
[2:38:59] linkitcraig: dps priest sucks at 25
[2:38:59] AceOfFlame: @user08cc21c8 uh no thats not true
[2:39:03] harvenius: balancing classes based on a single raid, is that a good basis?
[2:39:04] linkitcraig: the talents are good until 40
[2:39:04] sand_pump: why is raid parse the benchmark for a class being good? @StaysafeTV
[2:39:05] TPBaron: would make pvp aids probs
[2:39:06] iscamog: was random as fuck
[2:39:06] Guineasaur: They added caster crafted gear thats pre bis
[2:39:07] linkitcraig: arent* 3
[2:39:09] IR_ish: if they did start changing the dials it may as well be offset at level 60 again
[2:39:10] dirbagdan: @stressedattorney as a warrior main I agree
[2:39:11] Mccdowwell: lots of abilities and skill levels locked behind levels
[2:39:14] Mccdowwell: and talents
[2:39:14] kaladhras: As an ele main, you have literally none of the really valuable talents right now, I don't think you could buff them now without severely overtuning them later
[2:39:17] tinyangrygnome: is boomkin any good?
[2:39:18] Mungtime: priest dps isnt real until 40 with shadow form
[2:39:20] tex_oce: because higher ranking spells along with 40 talents they are confident they will be ok
[2:39:25] sweatlordkush: MAGE GOES OOM SO QUICKLY
[2:39:25] Tinman_VF: If you class has other options no need to balance now and break it later
[2:39:26] NotDessx: Bro we can't even fucking play death in raid.
[2:39:27] mattykek: Mages can AoE and are mid to ass at everything else.
[2:39:30] mrmangasm: They are really struggling to balance classes for future phases and also in pvp
[2:39:31] TheEndIsNear777: nerf all warrior ability damage by 10%
[2:39:32] TPBaron: that's more work though
[2:39:34] cinx787: Have the even buffed the bottom five speccs? Whats one random buff when an entire spec sucks lol...
[2:39:36] TheEndIsNear777: see how that works
[2:39:36] Trainingtobeperson: are you suggesting a hunter nerf?
[2:39:38] Zetherior: Warriors and Rogues cant heal and provide little to no raid buffs, everything else has a power thats relevant outside dps parsing, thats all rogue and war has @StaysafeTV

[2:39:53] mattykek: Ele sham feels bad
[2:39:54] TheEndIsNear777: Instead of heroic strike adding +50 dmg, nerf it to +30
[2:39:57] Thxkira56k: you can 99 parse as shadow priest
[2:40:01] Zaziben: Warriors still the worst class alone
[2:40:03] AceOfFlame: they really gotta buff the dmg on enhance
[2:40:06] dreamgoat: my shadowpriest alt gets a spot in alt raid
[2:40:08] tomble_: i mean mages can heal and dps why would they make them the best. the trade off is that they can do both @StaysafeTV
[2:40:12] xrazzaks: have you looked at tanks yet?
[2:40:12] tehworks: your hindinering
[2:40:13] orcenheimer: Ill invite anyone whos decently geared to this EZPZ raid. PvE is a joke
[2:40:14] TPBaron: LOL
[2:40:15] QuestFor420: warrior prio EZ
[2:40:15] mrmangasm: the goal should be buffing runes in ways that benefit the classes in pve and wont open up big scaling issues down the line
[2:40:16] Sleeping______: you can literally do it in 30mins with 6-7 people, as long as you have 1-2 warriors/rogues
[2:40:17] TPBaron: is this guy brainless
[2:40:18] Leytrrr: no shit lol

[2:40:23] Mungtime: KEKW
[2:40:26] iBanEvader: elitism and efficiency kills the fun again, it's only lvl 25 content and BFD is super easy @StaysafeTV
[2:40:27] TPBaron: only the good players are warriors duh
[2:40:28] user08cc21c8: OMEGALUL DUMB ASS CHATTER
[2:40:32] sweatlordkush: KEKW 99 parse with 20 dps
[2:40:35] szble: parse andy
[2:40:36] tex_oce: its easier to parse as a 99 on shadow priest ebcause no one is playing it
[2:40:39] IR_ish: they will prioritize a paladin over the frostmage (you)
[2:40:40] Sleeping______: Anyone caring about parsing in 25 BFD is mentally damaged
[2:40:42] mattykek: Parse is not dps

[2:40:53] SlapaH03: parsing KEKL
[2:41:03] TheTraderKing: 10 man gnomer KEKW
[2:41:04] mattykek: 10 man is ass
[2:41:05] Leytrrr: 20 Prayge
[2:41:06] stressedattorney: well the answer as to why its easier to parse as frost mage is bcause a lot less people play not because of damage
[2:41:10] QuestFor420: 20mans are alot better than 10
[2:41:11] fakenewsnoshoes: make gnomer 20
[2:41:11] mrmangasm: 20 or 25 would be ideal
[2:41:11] mattykek: 25 is where its at
[2:41:13] kaladhras: Prayge back to 40
[2:41:13] Denz0TV: 20 or 25 man would be pog
[2:41:13] Harles_: 15 would be nice 10 dps,3 heals 2 tanks
[2:41:15] Mungtime: 20 max for all raids Prayge
[2:41:16] HoneyNutScooter: nope stick to 10
[2:41:16] Lionkingler1: Yea
[2:41:17] pretty_cool_guy: 10 man is so fucking baddddddddddddddddd
[2:41:20] Mccdowwell: 40 man
[2:41:22] pretty_cool_guy: Madge
[2:41:25] wookieenthal: bigger raids = bigger aids
[2:41:26] thecollector313: flex raids would be dope
[2:41:29] Varels1: larger raids are more in the spirit of classic
[2:41:31] FieryEgon: 40 man pls
[2:41:34] Mccdowwell: you can bring a bunch of shitters with 40
[2:41:39] mattykek: Make Raids Great Again
[2:41:44] tomble_: mages can heal and dps why would they make them the best. the trade off is that they can do both. thoughts ?@StaysafeTV
[2:41:47] harvenius: what the fuck is a 99 parse
[2:41:52] Tinman_VF: 1 feral
[2:41:54] Dawgnito: Think GDKPs are bad now? Wait till 20mans come to play
[2:41:56] TheTraderKing: 2 hunter, 1 rogue, 1 warrior, 1 druid 1 caster YEP
[2:41:56] AceOfFlame: 20 max...40 mans are dogshit
[2:41:56] mrmangasm: and the other classes bring more benefit when they can buff a raid of 20 people aswell
[2:41:57] Varels1: we dont want 10man classic retail
[2:41:59] EnvironNA: 5, 10 , 20 no more
[2:42:01] jimbonni: @Mipolarization Bedankt voor het Cadeau-abonnement!
[2:42:02] fakenewsnoshoes: WE NEED MORE DIVERSITY
[2:42:02] TPBaron: more accommodating for more brown boys
[2:42:05] Zetherior: "Damage" is the sole purpose of War and Rog, every other class has a significant raid buff or shared power niche that isnt represented on this graph @StaysafeTV

[2:43:15] SabakuBlood: who caresssss
[2:43:15] xangfang: 25 way to early to tell
[2:43:17] coiozzz: warriors are dogshit solo compared to warlocks
[2:43:21] EnvironNA: they cant, it makes them too OP in PVP
[2:43:24] Sleeping______: you're talking about 1 phase... 4 weeks of lvl 25
[2:43:24] GoldenFool69: The agenda was posted and a meme, and parsing is for dorks outside of a tool for self improvement.
[2:43:25] ignitar: Boomkin Pog
[2:43:30] serbia_cs2: enhancer will be furious with WF
[2:43:31] sweatlordkush: they will be broken in phase 2 if they buff now
[2:43:32] dumpsack8: can you check 50 percentile
[2:43:32] jimbonni: Seen allot locks pump out some dps
[2:43:38] TheTraderKing: making everyone OP Kappa

[2:43:58] uhNick: BFD is easy af anyways
[2:43:58] sand_pump: i dont get it tbh
[2:43:59] Zaziben: we need a windfury equivalent for casters @StaysafeTV
[2:44:04] TPBaron: 40
[2:44:04] sleeplesswolf94: @viktor_test u clearly didnt play vanilla.  frost was the pve spec
[2:44:08] blazzedzz: It was funny listening to everyone bitch about star surge after the buff
[2:44:09] cinnamonamon: i think different classes and specs should be better at different things. Frost mage is still king of aoeing farming and solo content. Why does it need to be good in raids?
[2:44:09] desst1: we care @60
[2:44:09] 5by_five: how many mobs in BFD are immune to frost? @StaysafeTV
[2:44:11] jimbonni: tbh i do care for 40
[2:44:12] EnvironNA: You cant buff classes like spriest/boomy they are too OP in pvp.
[2:44:14] rammd4wg: I carrot
[2:44:15] snake_like: locks need a 1 minute fight to perform. you and the imp run out of mana.
[2:44:20] harvenius: i dont care :)
[2:44:21] sand_pump: warriors are also the WORST in the open world
[2:44:23] viktor_test: @sleeplesswolf94 it's not a Vanila
[2:44:27] iscamog: @sleeplesswolf94 only in raids with FIRE IMMUNITY
[2:44:31] sweatlordkush: mages will always be the best dps spec in phase 3
[2:44:32] coiozzz: IDGAF about parses
[2:44:38] wsnow_x: i think we care at 40/50 because of the talents and abilities we get later on.
[2:44:39] fitrick: warriors mains are DICKS
[2:44:41] SlapaH03: only 6 weeks
[2:44:42] sweatlordkush: mage is braindead and will be top dps in phase 3
[2:44:42] 5by_five: how many mobs are immune to shdaow damage
[2:44:45] stressedattorney: i think its probably harder to keep tweaking it because if u make things too powerful now we dk how theyll scale ... so maybe they r waiting until later phases to start making big waves
[2:44:50] user08cc21c8: there were alot of stealth nerfs
[2:44:52] kaladhras: I think 40 is the turning point because the full base tree of main spec talents are available, it'll be big good for casters
[2:44:53] Trainingtobeperson: 6 weeks 3 attempts 7 hunter nerfs
[2:44:57] Zaziben: @sand_pump wet noodle damage in wsg
[2:44:57] ignitar: Nerf hunters again BASED
[2:45:05] thetosis: the only thing that I don’t like is that getting groups as the “bad dps” is really hard.
[2:45:10] sweatlordkush: SPAM FROSTBOLT

[2:45:22] Zaziben: windfury equivolent for casters!
[2:45:24] chunky1983: all these nerfs are from a pvp standpoint where buffs seem to be pve
[2:45:24] GoldenFool69: idk, I feel like a more fair comparison would be top spec of each class. Especially since respecs are so cheap now.
[2:45:29] Gloriamas: comment / like
[2:45:33] thecollector313: yeah and they institute flex raids!

[2:45:46] harvenius: +5 damage to frostbolt, *dusts hands* it's not much but it's honest work
[2:45:47] GoldenFool69: shaman DPS specs aren't even online yet.
[2:45:50] therealfwizzle: the closer you get to 60 the closer to balanced the classes should be because they have more resources to make them balanced. 25 is kinda w/e at this point since 40 is around the corner but if it doesnt change then theres an issue

[3:28:46] TPBaron: @ToniFettuccine it's possible? I dunno what hunter and rogue bis is. The stats are what matters. Usually the higher item lvl, the better the stats. But sometimes the best itemized piece of gear is not the highest item lvl just based on stat allocation

[3:30:24] TPBaron: @ToniFettuccine easy example is a 2hand weapon for a warrior. Generally, you want a slower weapon because of high end weapon dmg based attacks like mortal strike and overpower. So a higher ilvl 2hand weap that is fast will be worse than a lower ilvl 2hand weapon that is slow (and thus has higher top end dmg per swing)
