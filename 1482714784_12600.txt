[4:09:34] itzskyeh: is mm hunter also good for raids and mythic or is surv the only top one
[4:09:42] Clicklesly: If you mouse over the spec icon it shows their ilevel ^^
[4:10:35] SherriJade: I am geared for and can play all 3 specs of hunter.
[4:10:42] itzskyeh: i just started playing again after like 8 years, got no clue how to get going.. almost finished lvling 1st char
[4:11:12] 91Niki: @itzskyeh Oh man, I can only imagine how overwhelming the game is after an 8 year break
[4:11:21] itzskyeh: its insane
[4:11:32] 91Niki: I felt overwhelmed just taking a break since start of shadowlands LUL
[4:11:36] itzskyeh: got no clue, and no 'decent' class guides

[4:11:48] 91Niki: @itzskyeh Wowhead.com <<< for class guides
[4:11:49] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh You missed the addition of Mythic dungeons in Warlords of Draenor and Mythic+ in Legion which is the most toxic shitfest so far in the game.
[4:12:10] itzskyeh: how is it toxic? :D
[4:12:14] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Kinda cool though, the concept of speedrunning and bossrushing which gets more and more challenging. I like/hate it.
[4:12:20] 91Niki: @itzskyeh https://www.wowhead.com/classes here you go mate
[4:12:27] shortyforthewin: i am spending my gold now in classic for boosting in sm haha
[4:12:27] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh There's a lot of drama about IO rating.
[4:12:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Karn1987 got that first kill on my deathknight when wotlk originally came out
[4:12:40] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Were you around for WoW-Heroes and Gearscore addons back in Wrath/Cata?
[4:12:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: Kappa
[4:12:48] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Yeah that shit came back.
[4:12:50] itzskyeh: @91Niki those guides are decent?
[4:12:56] itzskyeh: yeah i was kinda big boy in wotlk
[4:13:04] itzskyeh: all what mattered was gs xD
[4:13:12] pronkk_: 2k io
[4:13:19] pronkk_: lets you upgrade to 262
[4:13:31] 91Niki: @itzskyeh Yep, usually done by the best people. I can't promise they are all updated to the VERY recent Shadowlands patch, but mostly cuz the recent patch didn't really do much for changes in terms of play
[4:13:32] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Remember people not inviting you if you were just a few points under or didn't already have the achievement for a raid or even VoA lol that
[4:14:07] itzskyeh: ah bro, so i will kinda never be invited to anything :(
[4:14:23] Jessethoth: It's definitely got it's high points @itzskyeh I just wish they'd add a reason to do the slower style more like BC heroics alongside it.
[4:14:37] dyslexican1: m not guna lie, the requierment for IO to upgrade itesm is super annoying.
[4:14:38] itzskyeh: i remember pugs asking 6k gs for icc normal xD
[4:14:43] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh And people who bail on keys get no punishment, I wouldn't mind that, but you can't replace them.
[4:14:49] 91Niki: @itzskyeh But yeah, wowhead.com and then to the left side under "classes" the drop down menu shows all the classes and specs. and that has guides on talents, gear, covenants, you name it
[4:15:08] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Still a great game
[4:15:20] itzskyeh: @91Niki i will look up, thanks!
[4:15:36] itzskyeh: yeah i must say it looks cool, just so much stuff that i don't know what to do as soon as i hit 60
[4:15:42] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh You'll find people in dungeons aren't as talkative as when you last played though, it's not uncommon to do a run and not say a single word. People are a bit like bots now.
[4:15:42] itzskyeh: i just wanna discover the mythics and raids
[4:15:45] itzskyeh: but yeah..
[4:16:09] shortyforthewin: logged in eso but forgott how much whas the upgrade too get the necro
[4:16:14] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Mythic Raid is a thing too, a step above Heroic, feels more like Wrath/Cata era Heroic raids.
[4:16:45] itzskyeh: @Jessethoth that is actually awesome, i loved the challenge back in the day
[4:16:49] Jessethoth: Man I haven't been on ESO since like early 2019
[4:16:54] basedshrek: Guys what level is he? and what is max level in ESO?
[4:17:01] itzskyeh: moment we killed lk 25 on hc, was the best day in my gaming exp :D
[4:17:10] 91Niki: @itzskyeh https://www.raidbots.com/simbot for when you wanna compare gear for the best gear. Requires SimulationCraft addon. Super easily to use tho. Just type /simc in chat, copy the text, paste on the website, run the sim and it spits out information :D
[4:17:11] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh There's a lot more different levels of difficulty now.
[4:17:19] Jessethoth: @itzskyeh Something for everyone
[4:17:25] Theliahh: Current mythic is wayyyy harder than Wrath/Cata era heroic tho
[4:17:35] 91Niki: @itzskyeh That's for when you get to max level ofc
[4:17:43] Night_Ace: you got this, just kill it
[4:17:44] Slitze: / z
[4:17:45] belfastcl: zone I think
[4:18:01] itzskyeh: and any advice how to get started as soon as i hit 60?
[4:18:18] crizby_89: @basedshrek hes veteran level 7, it goes to 50 then after are your vet levels that go very high
[4:18:36] Jessethoth: @Theliahh Ehh, that's because raids as a whole have gotten harder
[4:18:45] Inswayne: Inswayne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[4:19:02] Relyonnn: Do u have continuous attack passive for 30% mount speed boost all time u look so slow
[4:19:04] Theliahh: champion levels @rlmascot veteran hasnt been a thing for a while :P
[4:19:07] Jessethoth: @Theliahh If they had never added Mythic I think Heroic would just be that hard now.
[4:19:25] crizby_89: @Theliahh Really? since when. Looks like the symbol nbext to his level
[4:19:28] captain_jee: What game ıs thıs:
[4:19:39] crizby_89: @captain_jee Elder scrolls online
[4:19:46] captain_jee: Thanks
[4:19:49] Odinslayer: why he sounds russian
[4:19:51] DrRyloth: russian tiger
[4:20:00] crizby_89: @Theliahh It has been a while since ive played though so i could be wrong llol
[4:20:01] TheGaoSora: Predator Mesa... why don't you sit over there?...
[4:20:18] Theliahh: @rlmascot Something like 5 years ago. That's just his level, once you hit 50 you do "Champion levels" and there's like 2000 of those
[4:20:30] 91Niki: @itzskyeh Can I whisper you on twitch, that is easier than typing out a novel in chat LUL
[4:20:37] crizby_89: @Theliahh thats what i meant . champion levels*
[4:20:41] crizby_89: @Theliahh thanks lmao
[4:20:45] duffluv22: Are delves. dungeons?
[4:20:46] itzskyeh: @91Niki yeah sure
[4:21:04] Seerated: My damn Twitch Prime is yolo...it's just gone. BUT, finally we got Amazon to . SE a few months back, I guess I should shut up
[4:21:11] bro_tein: you should practice weaving attacks between ur spells
[4:21:19] Slitze: that's a good spammable
[4:21:24] belfastcl: could get blastbones next
[4:21:26] captain_jee: What class is this?
[4:21:27] bro_tein: you end up slapping that way
[4:21:34] Theliahh: ESO leveling is weird tho you are scaled up to level 50 CP 160 until you actually hit that level, each time you "level" your scaling goes down and your gear gets better
[4:21:41] uzury: @captain_jee nECRO

[4:22:47] Theliahh: a good habit to get into is to left click (light attack) before using a skill like the scythe - the skill cancels the hit animation but the attack still goes off
[4:23:35] ahrs1988: this EOS looks pretty good
[4:23:45] Theliahh: ESO combat is surprisingly deep, and the class customization is awesome
[4:24:16] Slitze: skill ablilities have a global cooldown so usually you do a light attack in between each cast
[4:24:33] Slitze: it's called weaving
[4:24:47] stallowned: has anyone played ESO on xbox? im wondering how this plays on console
[4:25:01] SavageC33: Hows the game?
[4:25:09] belfastcl: also known as clown form
[4:25:12] ahrs1988: @Theliahh feel eos is underrated a bit?
[4:25:19] kokochris: @stallowned I have not. but I have used the controller on PC.  And the controller input is amazing
[4:25:22] crizby_89: @stallowned I actually started on xbox with this game and it ran fine for me
[4:25:33] bro_tein: @stallowned it plays fine but no addons is a bummer
[4:25:34] crizby_89: @stallowned Been a while though
[4:25:44] crizby_89: Good point^
[4:26:12] Theliahh: @ahrs1988 it has some of the best open world pve content, good quests/stories, tons of collectibles - which WoW is sorely lacking. The end game is a bit of a mess though
[4:26:29] stallowned: damn theres no addons for console. oh well ill still give it a try
[4:27:00] damokles062: i feel like eso is an underrated game - i love it so much!
[4:27:01] crizby_89: @stallowned i would. You'll still enjoy the game
[4:27:22] TheGaoSora: MY ULTIMATE IS CHARGING
[4:27:30] ahrs1988: @Theliahh how is the pvp? I played eos when it came out but stopped after lvl 40 or something
[4:27:35] mustiparta: might be waiting for a respawn
[4:27:39] Slitze: delves are pulbic so someone recently killed him.. he'll spawn
[4:27:46] Leggo_Saiyan: ESO got so much shit for no reason. The game is not as bad as people make it out to be.
[4:27:55] crizby_89: @ahrs1988 I personally lovved the pvp. The area is so big though to get around
[4:28:04] Slitze: i find more shit to do in this game than any other
[4:28:06] Theliahh: @ahrs1988 lots of fun but typical mmo pvp balance issues
[4:28:40] damokles062: the pvp is really similar to guild wars 2 - i like how large scale it is
[4:29:08] TheGaoSora: not herpies D:
[4:29:17] volkreig: What zone is towellie levelling in?
[4:29:45] mustiparta: @Leggo_Saiyan the reputation from when it first launched has just stuck, but they've made it so so much better. i think more people would enjoy it if they played to endgame
[4:30:01] TheGaoSora: the breton one isn't good?
[4:30:01] Slitze: light attacks
[4:30:02] Leggo_Saiyan: Agreed @mustiparta
[4:30:13] mustiparta: i really enjoyed the latest chapter tbh, i think blackwood is a ton of fun
[4:30:17] EKS90_: @pepeuzite I agree, last time i played it was basically only bow+ sword for all the buffs and debufffs
[4:30:17] danoh_64: just keep killing
[4:30:27] mustiparta: you can always port to a wayshrine
[4:30:36] WoW_StandalonE: is there a tru holy trinity?
[4:30:44] Slitze: yeah light attacks help generate your ultimate
[4:31:03] mustiparta: @WoW_StandalonE there sure is
[4:31:31] EKS90_: @pepeuzite same thing GW2 has IMO
[4:31:32] bro_tein: weave ur light attacks between spells to gen ulti
[4:31:40] ronireformed: ability + light attack for animation cancelling + ability pretty much eso combat
[4:32:50] TheGaoSora: the stitches wayshrine, do you go there if you're a snitch?
[4:32:55] EKS90_: @pepeuzite I enjoy the whole " get new gear and gearup and shit"  so for me GW2 becomes very stagnant. that is just personal prefeerence tho
[4:32:58] mustiparta: meta doesn't really matter until vet tbh
[4:35:49] DoubleNova: can every class do every role?
[4:35:52] mustiparta: most of its pretty easy yeah about on par with rares in zerith mortis in wow
[4:36:00] Slitze: @DoubleNova yes
[4:39:02] mustiparta: but some world bosses/zone events can certainly still do some damage. try soloing one of the dragons in elsweyr or a harrowstorm in the reach/western skyrim

[4:51:06] thespiderqueen: does he endorse propane and propane accesories?
[4:51:09] bypized: Yeah, its pretty wild
[4:51:22] bypized: Blizzard does not make money enough to voice act wow

[4:56:34] ExpectDragons: 3 years ago I bought ESO but in the middle of installing changed my mind and picked up WoW instead, good or bad choice?
[4:56:57] falldrgn: depends.. are you happy?
[4:57:02] Kakotan2143: @ExpectDragons i jump back and forth to both
[4:57:09] MayroVision: WoW > ESO
[4:57:09] xXSiebzehnXx: I like a good Apple Crisp
[4:57:11] mustiparta: @ExpectDragons idk man i play both :)
[4:57:19] bypized: @ExpectDragons Different games
[4:57:35] belfastcl: at level 10, you get the introduction quest to cyrodiil. After you do that you can access a passive that grants you +30% mount speed
[4:57:38] Gnarzee: 60/60/60 max mount stats
[4:57:43] Slitze: just focus on speed and visit a mount trainer everyday. not sure how many u can buy
[4:57:50] bypized: @Towelliee How long until they shutdown SWTOR?
[4:57:50] MayroVision: WoW > Fable on original Xbox > ESO
[4:58:02] robertJT_: start pvp quest line when you can you get a permanent speed buff from a passive
[4:58:07] ExpectDragons: I love elder scrolls games, if I can solo the game for the quests and get gear I'd try it
[4:58:20] AlphasaurusRexx: @MayroVision bro what crack you smokin. Fable is BiS
[4:58:39] xXSiebzehnXx: Levels and talents? Sold LUL
[4:58:47] mustiparta: you can max it with crowns if you want or get one a day from the stable masters, one of my few gripes with the game
[4:59:49] mustiparta: @ExpectDragons you can solo the vast majority of the game, vet/dlc dungeons and trials not so much
[5:00:28] xXSiebzehnXx: So the name of the calzone from Papa Johns is the “Papadias” , I long conned my coworker into telling me the name like I didn’t know so I could hit him with the “Papadias nuts in ya mouth” He was mad LUL
[5:00:31] Nokterian: @Towelliee got my 4 piece set yesterday on my Prot pally its damn fun for sure with bulwark leggo and unity!
[5:01:24] gormvonburic: buy one a day from stable
[5:01:25] saranmir: nop u can lvl other ways
[5:01:28] shrioxie: not with crowns
[5:01:28] danoh_64: buy the speed
[5:01:29] BitterNeff: you can go to a stable and level one up per day instead of crowns
[5:01:31] mustiparta: just go for speed if you want to use crowns
[5:01:33] Slitze: focus on speed.. you get 1% each day
[5:01:36] Slitze: visiting a stable
[5:01:39] sealink1100: you can pay gold from a stablemaster
[5:01:43] saranmir: yep 1 per day
[5:01:45] danoh_64: or stablemaster 1 a day
[5:01:53] xPraz: so 180 days to max out your mount
[5:01:54] sealink1100: yes 1 a day

[5:16:44] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ
[5:17:49] brewmen: Levelling up your horse and becoming a master crafter (9 traits) takes a long time so it's good to start it early.
[5:17:51] Kakotan2143: @callmestray Trials and PVP pretty much, new players it is nice, people playing for 10 years not so much cause they ran everything, but there is hard core stuff, to unlock great rewards, Speed run no die finish quest Vet Dungeons , thats for the min/max crowd
[5:18:06] mustiparta: @callmestray the endgame is fantastic imo, nothing is ever obsolete as far as item level goes so all trials can be relevant
[5:18:50] Kakotan2143: but what ever you do, DO NOT Try to run Vet Dungeons before 160 CP
[5:18:55] mustiparta: yup they refill
[5:19:23] Kakotan2143: Crates are random @Towelliee you could come through again and find stuff in things that say empty the first time
[5:20:05] Kakotan2143: Any way, my Vet Dungeon warning, most people in LFR will leave or kick you if you join a Vet before 160 CP

[6:52:54] hey_im_robby: Nice
[6:52:59] Slitze: they did have a statue of him a month ago
[6:53:04] hey_im_robby: I'm too poor for all that atm haha
[6:53:17] mustiparta: the high isles statue looks awesome
[6:53:19] Bo_Jangles_247: And yes @Arcon2825 you do get ap for the tutorial. It isn't enough to get rapids which is what I thought you were talking about.
[6:53:20] hey_im_robby: Wait, they did?
[6:53:22] Arcon_LP: In the beginning 30% mount speed bonus is essential.
[6:53:23] Slitze: in-game sorry
[6:53:48] Chuckforfun: Can someone help me last addon i bought was summerset was addon i also need to buy to have it all? ;D can someone help me
[6:53:53] Arcon_LP: @Bo_Jangles_247 I was talking about mount speed passive.
[6:54:13] mustiparta: love that john cleese still does voice acting in eso
[6:54:16] Bo_Jangles_247: Yep... caught that. was forgetting it.

[6:56:07] mustiparta: just cadwell stuff
[6:58:01] Arcon_LP: Man, makes me wanna login into ESO again. The game has its flaws, but in the end it is good.

[6:58:36] Gnarzee: thats a player house
[6:58:37] mustiparta: yeah that's a good way to describe it
[6:58:38] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The World Of Warcraft GEOGUESSR is INSANELY difficult! youtu.be/6kfMRPoOcOA
[6:58:43] Slitze: a house u can buy on the crown store
[6:59:14] belfastcl: housing housing
[6:59:18] danoh_64: think thats a quest line house
[6:59:24] mustiparta: like you can be super sweaty and hit max level in a day or take your time, whatever floats the boat
[6:59:25] shrioxie: its a house to buy
[6:59:44] Hitokiri83: a big tree? did it burn down?
[6:59:58] Arcon_LP: But New World is not even the size of one alliance zone from what I've seen so far? The different zones alone are 500hrs+ to quest in ESO.
[7:00:01] mustiparta: same house
[7:00:02] Slitze: it's all apart of the house
[7:00:04] shrioxie: preview
[7:00:08] mustiparta: its empty but you can preview furnished
[7:01:01] Slitze: max your speed
[7:01:09] Slitze: then carry capacity
[7:01:17] Slitze: naw it's daily
[7:01:17] shrioxie: i per day
[7:01:33] brewmen: lol, once every 20hrs I believe
[7:01:37] Slitze: 1 staple counts for them all
[7:01:42] brewmen: just once
[7:01:44] mustiparta: 20 hours per character, one of my few gripes with the game
[7:02:05] brewmen: The top one is speed, the bottom is storage
[7:02:11] Slitze: do 2 battlegrounds and you get 30%
[7:02:14] mustiparta: yeah can max it that way

[7:02:19] Arcon_LP: basically they want you to level your mount half a year... or spend money...
[7:02:19] shrioxie: not worth to buy with crowns
[7:02:28] brotherkyodai: cchelsHI
[7:04:43] mustiparta: yeah so its not really a loss you can always get what you want eventually with gems
[7:05:06] Arcon_LP: With the crown gems you can even buy the Radiant Apex Mounts now, which are the jackpot mounts of those gambling boxes
[7:05:09] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[7:05:37] mustiparta: poisons are 1 per strike, but stack like 1k and you just equip em in your inventory, it's mainly just for minmaxing later
[7:06:09] 91Niki: 🐔
[7:06:27] 91Niki: Omg that wolf pet next to him is super cute!!!!
[7:06:37] belfastcl: the skin and the mount are both from the 400 gem range, not bad
[7:06:51] robert_332: house item
[7:07:09] mustiparta: you and break most of those items down for gems when you're done
[7:07:36] mustiparta: so you can buy specific stuff you may want from crates instead of rng
[7:07:44] belfastcl: yep
[7:07:45] mustiparta: exactly
[7:07:47] robert_332: yes
[7:07:53] ThatGuyFayde: UNO MASS, uno mass
[7:08:22] mustiparta: imo i'd just break those down into gems, you can get poisons later for pretty cheap
[7:08:33] Slitze: there's champion points that help with speed also
[7:08:35] Gnarzee: 60 max per stat
[7:08:51] belfastcl: open the crown crate interface
[7:08:51] mustiparta: that 2nd circle top left
[7:08:52] Bo_Jangles_247: Not to forget what you get for daily login rewards.
[7:08:52] shrioxie: no you can't more with CP after lv 5+
[7:08:56] brewmen: you can get speed from champion points also, around 35% or so
[7:09:01] shrioxie: 50*
[7:09:02] Arcon_LP: Can get a 30% mount speed passive doing Cyrodiil tutorial. And there is a CP bonus.
[7:09:16] brewmen: the PVP gives you the best increase in the passive
[7:09:40] Slitze: yeah
[7:09:49] Slitze: it's a skill
[7:09:50] blokbeton024: yhea do 2 battlegrounds and u unlock a skill line
[7:09:58] blokbeton024: first passive it is
[7:09:58] Slitze: you open the skill line once u go there
[7:09:59] mustiparta: that second circle top left when you're in your inventory will take you to your crates menu and you can hit F to break items from your crates down into gems
[7:10:01] shrioxie: when you're lv50 a new game begins
[7:10:07] Arcon_LP: Don't skip the tutorial. That's essential to get enough AP.
[7:10:10] brewmen: you have to hit rank 3 I think to get the first increase then 7 for the final passive
[7:10:41] brewmen: while you level vigor it also levels your pvp rank

[7:10:45] mustiparta: go to cyrodil and just do the intro quest
[7:10:47] blokbeton024: no just que for battlegrounds
[7:10:55] belfastcl: 2 battlegrounds or the tutorial quest in cyro, whatever works
[7:10:56] mustiparta: tutorial will get you to level 3
[7:10:59] brewmen: I would get vigor so you can level up
[7:11:46] Slitze: L
[7:12:15] robert_332: blow lvl 50 if not lvl 50
[7:12:18] brewmen: anyone will work

[7:18:13] jessielight: player housing is so good too
[7:18:18] mustiparta: if you die you drop it and someone else can pick it up
[7:18:37] correctamundo1: volundrang can kill a lot =)

[7:20:24] brewmen: you can break down keep walls, kill people etc.  it drops at random locations in cyrodiil
[7:21:04] brewmen: you should have a new skill line now
[7:21:10] brewmen: your now in PVP area
[7:21:24] belfastcl: it hasn't been laggy since they upgraded the servers, believe it or not...
[7:21:35] brewmen: the gates are closed still so you should still be fine
[7:21:45] mustiparta: its 24/7
[7:22:11] mustiparta: cyrodil never stops esp in max level campaigns
[7:22:21] belfastcl: not yet, after you finish the chain you are doing now
[7:22:39] brewmen: I don't think you talked to the guy at the desk
[7:22:46] brewmen: now you have it
[7:22:54] Arcon_LP: you need to learn how to use catapults and all that shit to get enough AP for mount passive
[7:22:57] CrunkyBrewster: OH you're doing the PVP quest for the Mount Speed Boost
[7:23:15] brewmen: yeah, he wan't the mount speed
[7:23:19] CrunkyBrewster: sometimes this one tends to bug out and you dont get credit for the dummy
[7:23:39] GamerKillance: Wait towelliee playing eso? Did something launch?
[7:23:47] mustiparta: it gave him credit i think it wants him to do other siege machines
[7:23:48] GamerKillance: scottfShrug
[7:23:48] CrunkyBrewster: this is like a MUst do for every new character in my opinion
[7:24:18] CrunkyBrewster: well i mean from my experience i have had it bug out from time to time where it wouldnt give me credit for some odd reason
[7:24:25] CrunkyBrewster: yeah each other
[7:24:29] brewmen: yeah, it hekps your leveling and you get early access to vigor a good heal
[7:24:54] CrunkyBrewster: which is real good to have if he tanks
[7:25:37] mustiparta: so you have to equip it like your potions
[7:25:40] robert_332: it is under the quick bar stuff
[7:25:41] welborn19: you have to add it to quickslot
[7:25:41] CrunkyBrewster: you have to just target it and put the repair kit on your quickbar
[7:25:45] CrunkyBrewster: quickbar

[7:26:02] stillkold: the music is always epic on elder

[7:27:23] CrunkyBrewster: yeah there kind of is, but like i said I haven't been able to get it work since the last update. It's called Grid Inventory View I believe
[7:27:54] CrunkyBrewster: pretty much LUL
[7:28:57] robert_332: look at the first passive
[7:29:01] CrunkyBrewster: Yeah Vigor

[7:29:28] Korix88: Still*
[7:29:36] mustiparta: probably scythe
[7:29:41] ranin: is gameplay still restricted to 5 skills?
[7:29:51] belfastcl: you'll get the passive by the time you turn in the final quest of the chain
[7:29:52] Valaurus: maybe ricochet skull if you feel like you use scythe more, but I think skull is more damage
[7:29:54] CrunkyBrewster: see this is where im not good because im not that great at tanking lol
[7:30:13] legendesi: @ranin 5x2
[7:30:21] CrunkyBrewster: oh lord no probably not
[7:30:23] Arcon_LP: When you finish the tutorial at the temple you have enough AP for the passive
[7:30:24] mustiparta: 5 front bar and 5 backpar
[7:30:28] lookItsJB: @Korix88 It's not bad, honestly. More than enough to do all levels of group content continuously with minimal wait-time
[7:30:30] CrunkyBrewster: it's basically ten slots if you thinka bout it yeah
[7:30:40] bladdes_00: u have 2 bars on ESO...

[7:33:55] bypized: Flying Mounts when
[7:34:22] brewmen: now as you level vigor your level to get the next passive to get the 2nd part of that passive for speed
[7:34:33] CrunkyBrewster: Guilds are pretty easy to find. you can join a max of 5 of them which are all account bound
[7:34:36] mustiparta: the raiding can get really intense
[7:34:43] mustiparta: and you can be in 5 guilds at the same time
[7:35:22] Valaurus: blastbones is huge
