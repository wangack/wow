[3:49:45] StreamElements: @JabbaTheChinchilla It is not recommended to use dental floss for treating phimosis Consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate remedies and guidance They may recommend gentle stretching exercises or in severe cases a minor surgical procedure called a circumcision
[3:49:45] ahribeen: nymnREE
[3:50:05] copper_cloud: !phimosis
[3:50:06] StreamElements: @copper_cloud Phimosis refers to the tightness of the foreskin that hinders its retraction Adult circumcision can be a solution for severe cases where the foreskin cannot be stretched or retracted comfortably #PhimosisFriday
[3:50:07] retau_: bean can i duel u to rage up tmrw?
[3:50:10] JabbaTheChinchilla: !ask what kind of gentle stretching exercises can I do to help my phimosis?
[3:50:11] StreamElements: @JabbaTheChinchilla It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on addressing phimosis They can recommend specific stretching exercises or other treatments tailored to your situation

[3:50:29] StreamElements: @naughtiemares I'm not a doctor but attempting to fix phimosis with needle-nose pliers and rubbing alcohol is not recommended It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper advice and treatment options
[3:50:33] Shablagoosh: Kermit: sea doo made an arcane mage, and without knowing anything about how the spec works he just spammed spellsteal 130 times per game and got 2200 in shuffle in one night this week

[3:50:45] papaseat: !ask will Bean ever get circumcised?
[3:50:46] StreamElements: @papaseat That's not a question I can answer as I am an AI chatbot and do not have information on personal matters like that
[3:50:54] JabbaTheChinchilla: !ask what does phimosis smell like during a flare up?
[3:50:56] StreamElements: @JabbaTheChinchilla Phimosis itself doesn't have a distinct smell However if there's an infection or poor hygiene it can cause an unpleasant odor If you're experiencing any symptoms it's best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and guidance
[3:51:07] copper_cloud: cdew op?
[3:51:34] fuzzysucculent: arcane mage looks like its coming from another game, got way too much mobility/utility
[3:51:58] kenxxys: is bean learning
[3:52:35] dongersquadtv: !ask can phimosis cause an infection in your asshole?
[3:52:37] StreamElements: @dongersquadtv Phimosis specifically refers to tightness of the foreskin around the penis not the anus Infections in the anus are typically unrelated to phimosis However if you have concerns or symptoms it's important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate advice
