[0:27:50] Molvonos: There's several gaming news sites that are showing that info, so I just snagged the first one.
[0:27:59] DunzoCD: @BigBoxx91 at least you arent a bears fan :( we got it bad

[0:28:43] toobaked1987: EQ 3??? Just give up already. The name isn't even that recognizable anymore.
[0:28:44] mavericks312: basically that shit aint no where close
[0:28:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: the development on Everquest Next was eventually stopped in March 2016, as the developers claimed they could not make it fun. LUL
[0:29:04] jerkchickenpapi: Phins up baby!
[0:29:05] Molvonos: @toobaked1987 Everquest is still a thing, and still developing expansions for their original game.
[0:29:12] DunzoCD: another h1z1?
[0:29:32] Nerendis: They are remaking H1Z1?

[0:30:33] Scarhearth: @patti221 correct 24 years old.
[0:30:58] Molvonos: Everquest, I believe, is the first MMO of it's style (Ultima Online's built different), which most other MMOs used as a base.
[0:31:03] patti221: sounds like it came out when diablo 2 did.
[0:31:13] Nerendis: @BigBoxx91 Actually exact same, I got so lucky I didn't play them this week. Also Justin Herbet rofl
[0:31:18] Molvonos: Yea, Ultima Online's a third person ISO.
[0:32:01] Scarhearth: I still play EQ to this day lol

[0:47:53] mavericks312: brandon staley handed the vikings a win and they still fucked it up
[0:47:59] dimofodi: "Trust in the stache bro" He almost cost the Eagles their 1st round bye last season.

[0:48:41] kingdaddy96: @spookaninja_21 wrong. The only reason the pack won was cuz carr got hurt. The saints had to punt 6 straight times in the second half. The defense got worn out and that allowed the Packers to barely pull it off at the end. Has nothing to do with love being a saving grace

[0:54:26] mavericks312: @kingdaddy96 thats fair, its not my cup of tea but atleast its someone thats a good role model i guess
[0:54:33] dimofodi: @captivate7 before or after the superbowl? I honestly don't know where they met, figured she went to SB because of Eagles and ended up meeting.
[0:54:40] KontrolStyle: dolphins were insane, but the commanders played worst than denver lol
[0:54:58] flyingmachin3: pike is agi

[0:57:27] Bernardo994: probably my old games
[0:57:48] Nerendis: What about the owner's?
[0:57:52] polaropposite76: yeah the whole organization needs to be fired really
[0:57:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  maybe the ownership?
[0:57:59] mavericks312: why are you trying to make arguably the most athletic qb into a pocket passer
[0:58:07] Bawpears: The attitude of the team is a direct reflection of upper management
[0:58:11] spookaninja_21: im a 28 yo packer fan. this is the worst bears defence ive seen in my life
[0:58:12] jizmoh: yea the bar lmao
[0:58:22] gooseboy429: look at the jjets drafting qbs
[0:58:26] mavericks312: if you put fields on the falcons man he would be lighting it up
[0:58:49] polaropposite76: @mavericks312 the most baffling thing about that is how well he ran the 2nd half of the season last year and then it's like they completely forgot what worked
[0:58:59] kryptoimperium: kryptoimperium subscribed with Prime.
