[0:02:51] conksalot: Love the new intro!
[0:02:53] Ujai321: and that, chat, is what you can accomplish with a good night's sleep and a rising sun alarm clock
[0:03:07] wolfcloudchaser80: And the sound seems balanced better, too
[0:03:18] jakefx1: cant wait to see if theres a special action 0:00!!

[0:06:27] IAmScarlett__: i meant skeleton
[0:06:28] cashthb: could have done it in an evergreen area, like tol barad
[0:07:03] bellabeeboop: Hazel I hope your well, invincible finally dropped for me I squeeled and my 3 year old came in asked if I was okay >< the farm is finally over 🙌
[0:07:15] IAmScarlett__: despite everything happening at blizzard, i am indeed still hopeful for the future of wow
[0:07:18] anker_jym: Hardcore intro screen: Gnome walking around Thunder Bluff.
[0:07:47] Ujai321: i dont think you are pedantic
[0:08:11] Octopixy1971: Hello Hazel and Miss Kira hazelWave hazelShiny
[0:08:11] IAmScarlett__: that sword indeed does look ugly
[0:08:13] IAmScarlett__: but its okay!!
[0:08:52] cashthb: PogChamp 70
[0:08:56] IAmScarlett__: i have a question
[0:09:16] IAmScarlett__: is the champion of the dragonflights title account bound or is it only for the character thats done the epilogue
[0:09:26] Kurama__95: @IAmScarlett__ Not acc wide
[0:10:17] onegunpete: hey everyone!
[0:10:24] sence_00: Good morning Hazel! I want to thank you SO MUCH for showing us your Solo Shuffle grind because for the first time ever I've made progress toward a vicious mount! (just 96% to go lol)
[0:10:27] Ujai321: have you played more Palworld?
[0:10:41] anker_jym: It was indeed the smoochy scene
[0:10:56] adachi_akaso: omgg that purple looks great on you!
[0:10:57] IAmScarlett__: i hate when blizzard does those titles that arent account bound
[0:11:33] wolfcloudchaser80: The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
[0:11:44] cashthb: make it bigger
[0:12:38] cupcakechaos013: hey Hazel! happy Friday hazelLove
[0:13:08] cupcakechaos013: oo sub goal bar how exciting!
[0:13:28] KharmaDei: i find it interesting that the proven titles from wod are account wide, even on classes that can't do the role, i can use proven healer on my hunter and lock
[0:13:35] cashthb: I just got it by logging in without watching anything
[0:13:47] pet_pepi_rus: hi Hazel! although the news at blizzard was really sad, I wanted to say kudos to the one employee who before he got fired, used as many 1 year subscription codes that he had from working there, and now has an active wow subscription until late 2033!
[0:13:50] Airt1: @HazelNuttyGames do you remember how long you had to wait for it to rain on Jaguero Isle? I'm trying to get this baby ape pet and it's been ages
[0:13:58] anker_jym: I'm still waiting for them to make "Slayer of Stupid, Incompetent, and Disappointing Minions a permanent title lol
[0:14:56] sence_00: @Airt1 there is a pet collecting discord that will post groups if someone has rain on their shard, thats how i got it
[0:15:37] erinnightz: good after noon hazel and chat happy friday hope you are doing well. and hello miss Kira hazelWave
[0:15:42] GrumpyTV: Yo Hazel, if World of Starcraft came out and you tried it, which race would you try first? Terran, Protoss, or Zerg?
[0:15:48] Stealy: Morning Hazel!
[0:15:57] cashthb: I remember getting it.... it took a while... a long-long while
[0:16:00] komolana: i always find it so exciting when i see we're both in the same zone before i remember not only are we just on different realms, but different entire server regions lol hazelCry
[0:16:15] GrumpyTV: Yeah the super high APM stuff online was rough
[0:16:23] Ujai321: It was the thing to do at the time
[0:16:32] Ujai321: Especially when you liked Korea
[0:17:09] Stealy: What ya after this morning?
[0:17:35] anker_jym: Did that Korea phase include K-Pop?
[0:17:49] IAmScarlett__: i am working on a certain achievement
[0:18:20] GrumpyTV: The Light came to you in a dream
[0:18:39] cashthb: maybe it's a sign that you should play gothic
[0:19:18] little_c2222: Can you sing in korean?
[0:19:19] IAmScarlett__: i would like to be a mentor
[0:19:22] IAmScarlett__: so i need 2k quests
[0:19:25] komolana: i swear like everyone was into kpop in 2016 (or am i just projecting? lol)
[0:19:28] HazelNuttyGames: !drop
[0:19:38] cashthb: yeah, it's pretty much the og western rpg
[0:19:52] IAmScarlett__: u typed the command wrong
[0:19:53] Vesamora: I'd never heard a note of anything kpop until I heard a BTS song in February 2020
[0:20:09] HazelNuttyGames: !drops
[0:20:09] Streamlabs: Earn the Grim Campfire toy drop here! Details and FAQ https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24054789/dragonflight-twitch-drop-get-the-grim-campfire-toy-now-live
[0:20:32] IAmScarlett__: typing is so 2023
[0:20:38] IAmScarlett__: yes
[0:20:46] IAmScarlett__: ive only done 230 lmao
[0:20:52] tempestmellinger1901: hi guys
[0:21:38] Zuldak: the kyrian followers for the missions are terrible. Necrolords are the way
[0:21:43] Kurama__95: The Kyrian table was the weakest ones iirc
[0:22:27] Kurama__95: All my mission table farmers were Night Fae, their troops are OP
[0:22:33] dergNwolf: man... opened a ticket last night because the gametime code I wanted to use didn't work on EU and accidentally did work for US. Wrote a ticket. It's resolved but... I'm sad now. Fuck Microsoft
[0:22:36] dergNwolf: werenwCry
[0:22:36] pet_pepi_rus: night fae table for the win!
[0:23:11] KharmaDei: i still haven't done all of the quests i need for mentor on my main i've used since 9.0
[0:23:19] MiguelGamma: afternoon hazel
[0:23:39] Leozueiro: That's such a cool mount.
[0:23:39] bellabeeboop: Hazel could I ask how you the tab up for all your hearthstone to choose please 🙏
[0:23:52] Ujai321: The EGGstra chance, some might say
[0:24:00] Vesamora: I keep forgetting about old world dragonriding. I remembered and made it from south Westfall to Stormwind mage tower in like 30 seconds.
[0:24:24] bellabeeboop: Thank you 😊
[0:24:54] KharmaDei: dragon riding from shattrath to the eye was so nice
[0:25:10] KharmaDei: don't have to manually fly for so long anymore
[0:25:18] Arabany: Is it now possible to do every covenant campaign on one character?
[0:25:40] Kurama__95: I'm bitter that I bought the Manuscript then I had to buy the toy too without the refund for the Manuscript savixD
[0:25:57] Vesamora: I bought the item before they made it into a toy and it was never converted. Maybe I have to log into that character again, but I just don't have it
[0:26:19] fallingupwards: The completionist in me wants gold in each race
[0:26:27] Vesamora: @Kurama__95 welp
[0:26:31] Kurama__95: Outlands Cup was a lot easier compared to the other ones imo
[0:26:48] fallingupwards: Theres a title for gold in everything ha
[0:27:03] sence_00: Dig time, if youre interested
[0:27:34] Ujai321: Do you know the movie The Santa Clause, with Tim Allen?
[0:28:12] komolana: which is your favourite mage spec?
[0:28:20] heldtheline: A tip with monks is doing the daily enlightenment quest just to stack up rested xp.
[0:28:31] wolfcloudchaser80: A tip for the Outland Races: The thorny briar stuff that looks like a net can be flown through even if the big pieces will stop you
[0:28:37] anker_jym: You mean you no longer did the Digs D:
[0:29:07] anker_jym: Dig the dogs, dang autocorrect
[0:29:11] little_c2222: Why play a mage then?
[0:29:12] Ujai321: It took me until late last year that it's a Clause why you become Santa. It's not that Santa Claus is spelled with an E at the end now. Blew my mind
[0:29:14] komolana: mm that's super fair, i only play mage when playing with my partner because she likes playing rdruid so its a nice combo
[0:29:16] anker_jym: DIG THE DIGS, MY LORD
[0:29:23] norsewinde: I'm the same way. I really enjoy my frost mage but always fall out of love when I can't heal myself ever. :(
[0:29:45] fallingupwards: Magefooood
[0:29:49] MackPlays: Ice block heals you
[0:30:17] anker_jym: Mage portals are also nice
[0:30:40] mayer2911: Thanks for the drops Hazel!!@
[0:30:57] Ujai321: Tim Allen murders Santa and becomes Santa. You know. Classic Christmas stuff.
[0:31:13] Alireia: May I ask, is the wig synthetic or real hair? It looks REALLY good omg
[0:31:18] heldtheline: It was so nice when evocation healed as well.
[0:31:23] cashthb: you can heal yourself, just drink a potion
[0:31:25] anker_jym: If you become a Dark Iron Dwarf Mage with Engineering, you can go pretty much anywhere
[0:32:04] AztraTheSupermage: mages can self heal wirth ice block
[0:32:15] aceorcent: lmao literally who i am
[0:32:19] Zuldak: nightborn or void elf Kappa
[0:32:19] cashthb: or you can just try to learn to kite
[0:32:20] KharmaDei: a nice 3 minute 20% heal is kinda nice if i just got absolutely slapped in a key
[0:32:23] dergNwolf: gayLurk worgen
[0:32:25] aceorcent: draini mage to save my own skin
[0:32:31] aceorcent: too lazy to spell
[0:32:38] komolana: nighborne mage is such a good aesthetic
[0:32:50] bellabeeboop: I have a nightelf frost mage called Demiguise and I keep wanting to level her but then leaving it ><
[0:32:52] fallingupwards: I want to like my mage but they never hold my interest
[0:32:59] sence_00: I miss early SL Fire Mage...sun kings blessing makes me so sad
[0:33:03] wolfcloudchaser80: Red eredar draenei!
[0:33:04] Ujai321: I found frost mage surprisingly durable in solo play
[0:33:23] KharmaDei: rip sali, i'll never forget her
[0:33:24] Zuldak: i remember when void elf came out and you were like 'yes new main race!'
[0:33:24] Kurama__95: Any heritage armor you're missing? Could be an excuse to get it LUL
[0:33:48] Ujai321: Between shields, block, and not getting hit while bursting mobs
[0:33:48] Marmoh: I want to make a priest but only if I can make her look like that troll boss in atal dazzar
[0:33:53] wolfcloudchaser80: Think of how interesting and different the transmog matching options would be with the eredar skin.
[0:34:07] Nickystr1x: the hopping is actually essential, you can also strafe if you rather
[0:34:33] Alireia: I pretty much don't play alts at this point but I would swap mains in a second if they ever do bard with a healer spec lmao
[0:35:07] Ujai321: I was busy pressing buttons for the rotation to also press buttons to jump. I'm too old for that
[0:35:11] RigzDigz: I generally strafe to cancel, takes less time
[0:35:15] Ujai321: *too busy
[0:35:16] cashthb: yes
[0:35:18] Nickystr1x: well, proper play is to always queue up your next spell before the global is up. and if you're waiting on a pyro to hit then you dont have the heating up proc yet
[0:35:23] dergNwolf: but the goofy male worgen animations
[0:35:26] dergNwolf: werenwAwoo
[0:35:28] mynameisfd: hi
[0:35:32] heldtheline: You could always use another druid...
[0:35:36] KharmaDei: my main's an eredar shadow priest
[0:35:44] Elrathir: nobody misses the worgen heritage armor
[0:35:48] cashthb: or maybe no, do the lady worgens still do that weird-ass stomp while casting?
[0:35:55] dergNwolf: no mages is based
[0:36:00] Nickystr1x: i have a guildie who has a monk of every race
[0:36:01] mynameisfd: how many mounts u have?
[0:36:05] anker_jym: Man, if I could be an Ethereal Shadow Priest...
[0:36:09] GreenArrowed: that is definitely my approach to warlocks and paladins. never enough.
[0:36:18] emmsnake: i main worgen rogue
[0:36:19] conksalot: Worgen Hunter is pretty good to be honest.
[0:36:20] KharmaDei: the worgen casting animations are so dramatic
[0:36:20] emmsnake: it's amazing
[0:36:21] Ujai321: Malee worgen
[0:36:26] Sugar_Mana: I like the worgens but Tauren's for me are the goofiest looking
[0:36:34] conksalot: They look much less silly firing a gun.
[0:36:40] anker_jym: I have a Worgen Rogue, it's fun
[0:36:45] Kurama__95: Maybe a Worgen Druid, so you never actually see your player model savixKEKW
[0:36:55] wolfcloudchaser80: Worgen casters use the secret technique of Scooping Magic
[0:37:10] Ujai321: Ok, but the real question Hazel
[0:37:10] cashthb: their overhead swings were also weird, idk if they changed that in legion, so they're pretty much locked to the dual wielding specs for me
[0:37:13] Zuldak: Male taurens have the weird back hump. A lot of male races have awful posture and it bothers me
[0:37:23] Elrathir: I like my male worgen outlaw rogue. Can also fire a gun!
[0:37:29] Sugar_Mana: female tauren's look so dopey to me xD like theyre about to fall asleep
[0:37:32] Ujai321: Would you dress your furry worgen in the wooly wendigos
[0:37:34] Zuldak: I am so happy zandalari were added because i love the trolls but hated having an S curved spine
[0:37:40] Kurama__95: @Zuldak But that makes them relatable tho Kappa
[0:37:42] azrazil720: I have a male Tauren DK named Diabullo, the only reason I ever made a male Tauren 😂
[0:37:53] little_c2222: Better
[0:37:55] anker_jym: You could use the epic gear from the weekly and make Enchanting mats
[0:38:04] Ujai321: I mean it's probably horrible for thermal management
[0:38:07] Zuldak: Yeah Tauren Warlock = Grimtotem
[0:38:15] Elrathir: taurlock
[0:38:32] KharmaDei: yeah everyone got warlocks in one go
[0:38:34] Zuldak: yep recently added. They start at your favorite place: Darkmoon Fair!
[0:38:42] Elrathir: sorry I had to get that pun out of my system
[0:38:49] aceorcent: What's a good healer? pairing wise? I main a frost mage, but have a party we need a healer for so I need to make a new toon
[0:38:54] emmsnake: I think I knew you didn't care for Worgen, but it still hurts to hear you say :(
[0:38:57] Ujai321: You have a bunch of dead locks in hardcore
[0:38:58] Zuldak: yes no joke the new lock races start at the fair
[0:39:06] anker_jym: As a Warlock main, the amount of Warlock love we've gotten this Xpac has been quite nice.
[0:39:37] averageteacup: Boy is a legend
[0:40:07] Zuldak: Lock is just kinda easy to play. Like my 440 ilvl lock can slap 80k dps which aint bad for that ilvl
[0:40:11] mcxoney: and if u want to dps play discpline :D
[0:40:14] bellabeeboop: Off topic but my 7 month old has not long woke up and keeps smiling and cooing at you <3
[0:40:28] Kurama__95: If you click the "Restore Character" button you'll see a lot of dead warlocks Kappa
[0:40:39] Redpandalol: @hazelnuttygames what was your most painful tattoo. I’m floating an idea for a tattoo on the front side of my ribs
[0:40:51] cashthb: I would remove them, there should only orcs and human, maybe dwarfs too but they shouldn't be playable
[0:40:53] Zuldak: i run keys with a MW monk and they always yell something about being out of tea. idk, i just continue pulling
[0:40:58] Ujai321: Listen, I remembered that it was only one dead lock. *I* have a bunch of dead locks in hardcore
[0:41:28] Zuldak: getting towards lymph nodes
[0:41:42] GreenArrowed: top side of thigh can be hurty if you're tattooing over the big nerves there. learned that the unfortunate way.
[0:41:45] Vesamora: I have a bit tattoo on the outside of my ribs on my left side. It hurts like a normal tattoo but the vibrations are pretty intense because it wraps around your body and hits your spine
[0:42:12] Zuldak: ive never had a tattoo >.>
[0:42:13] anker_jym: Hazel, are any of your tattoos WoW themed?
[0:42:26] fallingupwards: My sleeve hurt most on the elbow and near the armpit
[0:42:31] Zuldak: im a werido in portland for not having tattoos
[0:43:10] ArshadYousef: ArshadYousef subscribed with Prime. 
[0:43:11] Streamlabs: arshadyousef just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:43:13] germando1979: arms and legs are easy, my neck hurt the most
[0:43:31] Kurama__95: And if you pick a Disney or Nintendo tattoo you might get sued in the future Kappa
[0:43:34] Zuldak: Kinda like naming your child daenerys from GOT when you're only in season 5
[0:43:34] Sugar_Mana: OctoSiren subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:43:35] Streamlabs: octosiren just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:43:37] cashthb: whacha mean, you won't talk me out of tha bud light tattoo
[0:43:39] Stealy: No fun being a billboard!
[0:43:52] conksalot: OMG. Portlander with a tattoo. I have a lazy brown bear sitting in a grove.
[0:44:01] heldtheline: Would you get a Moose &/or Kira tattoo?
[0:44:03] conksalot: Nature tattoos forever.
[0:44:04] sence_00: I always heard feet would be the worst but didnt think it was bad at all. The worst is any big colour coverage imo
[0:44:04] Zuldak: a real Poison Ivy vibe with all the foliage
[0:44:11] cashthb: how about a Treebeard tattoo?
[0:44:19] Kydar: please pet kitty for us <3
[0:44:22] jgbrit: Howdy ✌️
[0:44:53] Sugar_Mana: <3 <3
[0:45:05] melbrekke: melbrekke subscribed with Prime. 
[0:45:05] Streamlabs: melbrekke just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:45:07] Kydar: Heck yes kitty love. Thank you
[0:45:08] jgbrit: I am, today and tomorrow 😃
[0:45:12] emmsnake: so if you would not want an IP on your body, does that mean you would not want to be a character in an IP since your opinion of them could change?
[0:45:14] Alireia: I've never been interested in tattoos for myself but I love admiring them on other people
[0:45:20] sence_00: aww she gave you kisses
[0:45:24] Klorin: Last time I saw her no hair, and now this..?
[0:45:31] jgbrit: !wig
[0:45:32] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:45:36] bellabeeboop: I have my horses name tattooed on me with a small horse shoe honestly one of my favourites as she Brough me so much joy had her since I was 9 and she passed when I was 26
[0:45:48] Ujai321: Command is still hilarious
[0:46:01] jgbrit: It's very to the point 😂
[0:46:29] Alireia: I love people thinking someone can go from a buzz cut to 20+ inch hair in a matter of days lmao
[0:46:52] wolfcloudchaser80: I intend to get a tattoo pawprint to keep my special pup close to me now that he's moved on.
[0:47:05] Kydar: @wolfcloudchaser80 <3
[0:47:06] jgbrit: @alireia have you met my beard 😂
[0:47:15] bellabeeboop: I feel like the it's a wig needs to be a spoken command like it's a trap from star wars ><
[0:48:01] Alireia: @jgbrit Well facial hair is supposed to grow very fast isn't it? I'd say that's different tbh
[0:48:12] anker_jym: I'm so close to finishing my ultimate Druid mog: Green Leather seeds mog, Forest Lord's Antlers, of the Emerald Dream title. I'll never need another mog again lol
[0:48:48] aceorcent: ur inventory is so clean and empty FallCry howwww
[0:49:02] Kurama__95: @saviorofazeroth That's what I use on my druid, but with "the Dreamer" title and the Night Fae moth backpack
[0:49:27] Lee57King: but I never know if I am holding something important I need to something
[0:49:44] cashthb: but what if I need that 8000 noggerfogger
[0:49:48] Alireia: I want Broken Isles races, I feel like Stormheim and Highmountain are perfect for it
[0:49:55] Piktorr: I just transferred my character to moon guard, feels lonely without all my other alts in the log screen lol
[0:50:15] anker_jym: @kurama__95 That's a good idea as well!
[0:50:27] Lee57King: it's all soulbound though
[0:50:29] aceorcent: but what if i need those 100 pandaria motes when i havent been on the continent in 2 years??
[0:50:32] royos__: Morning hope you are having a great stream -- just a reminder your add-on spreadsheet is + 6 months
[0:50:36] sence_00: SL Dragonraces will be great in Revendreth too
[0:50:39] BoogiePonderosa: i recently got the Toymaster achievement and i'm disappointed it's not also a title
[0:51:19] sithlordasura: why the mobs are not attacking when you passing through?
[0:51:19] anker_jym: The day they made the Transmog tab was the best day for bag space
[0:51:39] jgbrit: I'm glad the Outland Cup Tmog costs less than the Kalimdor Cup. 10 tokens per piece cheaper
[0:51:46] BoogiePonderosa: they know not to mess with Hazel! hazelFlex
[0:51:51] Ozilcraft: oh I didn;t kniow that
[0:51:51] sithlordasura: oh it's a normal dungon
[0:52:22] wolfcloudchaser80: My bag cleaning annoyance now is that I need to visit the catalyst thing to make sure I have all the transmog possibilities before deleting
[0:52:28] BoogiePonderosa: 150 toys
[0:52:32] sence_00: you probably have Toymaster
[0:52:38] Minobard: just joined - did you get the parrot?

[0:52:53] Minobard: woops - guess not
[0:53:09] averageteacup: There is toy knife for your crab pet
[0:53:29] azrazil720: what pet is that blue snail??

[0:54:56] fallingupwards: I've wanted to play my priest but getting harassed for pi is annoying lol
[0:55:06] komolana: that head mog kinda makes it look like you're playing a frog race and now i want a little playable frog race omg
[0:55:06] sence_00: feelin good about this attempt
[0:55:07] brooklynitetv: Didn't realize we could solo sharkbait now! :o
[0:55:12] drakkhis: GL Hazel

[0:55:24] sence_00: :(
[0:57:38] Pakulia: Wait how did you do that?
[0:57:40] wolfcloudchaser80: @komolana Everquest has such a race, the Frogloks!
[0:57:42] McShamwhich: i'm sorry. what addon was that and what toy was that?
[0:57:47] cashthb: use the pink one!
[0:57:48] arcanumtechnica: Wait... wait.... when was that added? The teleport via critter sacrifice?
[0:57:58] pet_pepi_rus: all the critters in Hazel’s pet collection just had their lives flash before their eyes
[0:58:01] cashthb: nvm there is actually a pink
[0:58:09] arcanumtechnica: O_O
[0:58:11] arcanumtechnica: Need
[0:58:27] McShamwhich: OMG.. i never knew I had that toy
[0:58:42] Kurama__95: I used it once a week to farm the Warglaives LUL
[0:58:43] Pakulia: Oh just the Black Temple? Nvm then. I have a ring for it :D
[0:58:53] McShamwhich: And the portals work for dungeon ports too ? (the addon)?
[0:58:59] anker_jym: It comes in handy if you're doing Black Temple mog runs! Or for Warlocks who want to switch their fire color
[0:59:08] Pakulia: But would love it if the game made a UI for all the teleportation stuff we have
[0:59:38] Vesamora: Today I learned that if you max speed dragon ride into the green Dark Portal you just smash into the mountain behind it
[0:59:40] McShamwhich: Thank you for that
[0:59:53] Stealy: what was that about a random hearthstone addon? Which?
[1:00:27] Pakulia: cloaks and rings and stuff?
[1:01:01] murloc_kingkiller: I love that wow took a page out of GW2 mounts with DF it kinda saved the game
[1:01:12] BoogiePonderosa: that's cool
[1:01:15] Pakulia: Ohh
[1:01:23] little_c2222: Wow
[1:01:30] Pakulia: That would save me so much bar space lol
[1:01:41] Stealy: wow been looking for something like that - gotta look that up....trying to work while I listen
[1:01:45] Minobard: the tokens for racing in outlands are bind on account?  still new to dragonriding

[1:03:09] McShamwhich: You started a quagmire.. everyone was impressed by the addon. Ty for being so helpful.
[1:03:15] victoryvix: sorry - for asking you to repeat - but what was the toy?

[1:03:22] sithlordasura: thanks :)
[1:03:47] Stealy: Learn something new everyday for you Hazel!
[1:04:05] novie95: as someone with a dirt pc, i wish blizz would create some kind of teleport menu so you dont have to go thorugh 1-4 loading screens to get to the destation.

[1:04:57] Atomicpanda: these races were kinda brutal
[1:05:01] IAmScarlett__: how dare u ride sarkareth and no frank
[1:05:03] IAmScarlett__: jk
[1:05:27] Matooba: When the races first came out I was really good at them. now for some reason, I really stink at them LOL
[1:05:37] Zuldak: you knwo the biggest thing i regret in DF? Killing raszageth. She was cool and she was one and done in a single patch
[1:05:40] IAmScarlett__: the frank one is a homie
[1:05:58] Atomicpanda: i had to turn down the effects
[1:06:37] Kurama__95: @Zuldak Also feels bad how Vyranoth picked her title in honor of her deceased sister that WE MURDERED
[1:06:40] anker_jym: Good thing I never play beta then lol
[1:06:52] Tandy000: I'm sad we never saw a visage form for Razzy.
[1:06:53] pet_pepi_rus: we were robbed of seeing razageth visage form
[1:07:00] exalted1715: biggest regret i had in Dragonflight was making the evoker lego, because its not bis for the whole expac
[1:07:04] Zuldak: @Kurama__95 it was super awkward for her to be honoring her dead sister in front of the murder hobos who did the murdering...
[1:07:15] shaychthree: on my old pc, i had to turn down my graphics settles to almost nothing to dragonride because it triggered my vertigo so badly. on the new pc, i have no trouble at all.
[1:07:16] McScooterson: same thing happens to me. every time I think I've got all the settings matched to live, the ptr dragon riding still feels off and I get woozy
[1:07:17] secretmilkshake: I can still her yelling “Marked by lightning!”
[1:07:22] murloc_kingkiller: Hellfire Hustle is def my fav
[1:07:23] IAmScarlett__: i bet hazels regret was not getting the evoker leggo
[1:07:27] Kurama__95: @exalted1715 You'll probably be able to upgrade to max ilvl in S4 with dinars like the hunter bow tbh
[1:07:38] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, this one was the most annoying for me.
[1:07:40] Triskelian: Whoever thought to put race courses through trees, etc, is a freaking SADIST -_-
[1:07:49] exalted1715: thts nice, but 2 seasons not bis doesnt make it worth it
[1:08:18] murloc_kingkiller: why is it called a leggo? haha
[1:08:20] wolfcloudchaser80: And Netherstorm ones had some challenging blind turns
[1:08:27] pet_pepi_rus: did Hazel just say lizards aren’t cute!?
[1:08:52] Runzi333: I love yours though! hahaha
[1:09:28] conksalot: I was glad you went back to Priest. The xmog game is so bad on Evoker. I'm swapping to something else next season, too.
[1:09:33] Zuldak: you like the more humanoid races
[1:09:48] Wooden_01: Is the Evoker era over?
[1:09:49] Runzi333: Have you watch the color of magic???
[1:09:52] Runzi333: :D
[1:10:00] Tandy000: Appreciated the dracthyr form once you "scaled" back some features....
[1:10:13] Zuldak: so confirmed Hazel is not a furry
[1:10:19] McScooterson: Color of Magic is fun times, but nothing tops Hogfather for tv specials
[1:10:25] MaddiDJ4: my dad made me listen to discworld on a 10hr road trip last month. we started with pyramids, then monstrous regiment, then settled on and finished wee free men. overall? I need to read the rest
[1:10:32] Runzi333: Most people don't know that theres a diskworld movie!
[1:10:38] Kurama__95: @Zuldak She does like druids a lot tho Kappa
[1:10:51] sithlordasura: evoker race would be human or animal lol bcz evoker can fly by themselves :X
[1:10:52] Elrathir: I suspect that once Dracthyr mages become playable, Hazel won't be playing one
[1:11:00] Runzi333: Yeah it was a 3 hour movie but it's on amazon prime in three parts which is better
[1:11:18] Husskarl: The Guards books are amazing. I like Vimes
[1:11:21] Runzi333: Love the diskworld stuff
[1:11:24] McScooterson: Going Postal also excellent tv times
[1:11:39] Triskelian: @Husskarl Vimes is the BEST
[1:11:46] witchhobbit: i missed it, what book are you reading right now?
[1:11:52] Runzi333: Ann McCaffery has a lot of books about one world but different people and times on the world
[1:11:57] McScooterson: earlyish aughts? I think
[1:12:05] shaychthree: there was a tv series based on the watch, too
[1:12:14] Runzi333: She's what they actually rip off when they make dragonrider stuff tbh
[1:12:17] Creaturebrush: Is the toy for classic or retail? :)
[1:12:23] McScooterson: @shaychthree did it end up being good? Don't think I had cable when it came out
[1:12:29] Husskarl: Going Postal, Making Money, Raising Steam are my favourites
[1:12:47] Creaturebrush: Naice :D
[1:12:48] HazelNuttyGames: !drops

[1:13:05] heldtheline: One of my favourite books had a movie adaptation where they made the love interest the villain. I have feelings about adaptations now.
[1:13:06] Zuldak: it still feels odd they are doing cata classic
[1:13:29] Creaturebrush: Dont worry, drunk flying is absolutely allowed in Azeroth
[1:13:37] McScooterson: @Zuldak whatever gets me to panda classic
[1:13:45] Shrezsan: my late husband loooooved Discworld and Terry Pratchett.  we got to meet him at a book signing once and he was a very cool guy.
[1:13:50] witchhobbit: sourdough is the bessst
[1:13:55] denk21345: ATT > Promotion > DF Seasonal Promotions
[1:14:13] Zuldak: there was a lock in vanilla classic who rolled need and won the corrupted ashbringer so that when pandaria comes around, their felguard can mog it
[1:14:18] sithlordasura: i got motionsicked by just watching this race lol
[1:14:25] Triskelian: @Shrezsan So jealous!
[1:14:29] Runzi333: I might play mists classic tbh hahaha
[1:14:46] Jaxameire: Speaking of breads - have you made many focaccias?
[1:14:49] anker_jym: Who here is excited for Shadowlands Classic??
[1:15:00] Kurama__95: I would play MoP and WoD Classic just to do the questlines they, for some ungodly reason, removed from the game
[1:15:00] Runzi333: lol
[1:15:14] MaddiDJ4: haha I’m out here waiting for legion classic. first time I actually played outside of leveling in vanilla zones thinking armor was all I needed as a hunter
[1:15:15] Jaxameire: Do you have any tips on making them - I have an urge to make one?
[1:15:31] mcxoney: im looking forward to getting tarecgosa's rest on cata classic ^^
[1:16:24] Jaxameire: Ah good point! thanks hazelShiny
[1:16:30] Piktorr: I loved panda expansion but not many did
[1:16:48] sithlordasura: I loved MOP too
[1:16:55] emmsnake: pseudo sour dough?  Pseud-or dough? :P
[1:17:01] Dreyfusxano: Mists definitely was cool
[1:17:08] SylsGames: Just bought wheat flour to get my starter going again.
[1:17:24] Zuldak: irish soda bread is quick and good
[1:17:31] murloc_kingkiller: doing this cup made me realize the outland is pretty huge for a early expansion map-wise lol
[1:17:41] Piktorr: love the music here during riding
[1:17:44] SylsGames: Rye would probably work better but couldn't find any at store
[1:18:00] MaddiDJ4: to loosely quote my nana, “in 3 days do you want to be 3 days older or be 3 days older and have a ciabatta”
[1:18:09] dvkJoe: Hey
[1:18:17] Piktorr: @hazelnuttygames how’s the doggy doing
[1:18:47] Dreyfusxano: These cups just award tokens for transmog?
[1:18:51] sithlordasura: have you tried follower dungon?
[1:19:50] sithlordasura: @Dreyfusxano yeeap
[1:20:06] Dreyfusxano: Okay
[1:20:30] McScooterson: Oh I totally missed they turned it into a toy
[1:20:42] Dreyfusxano: Nokud Offensive was hard as a healer
[1:20:47] MaddiDJ4: that’s what happened to my papa, but he was probably in his 40’s. he wanted to go to vet school, so the original nana quote was “do you want to be 8 years older or 8 years older and a vet.” he went on to become a vet, animal chiropractor to be specific, and he loved it
[1:20:55] HeyKairhys: My old pharmacist got her doctorate at 50 after being a maths professor for years, kids were out of the house, so she went back to school
[1:21:02] Shroomgirl81: Are the dragon riding tokens in bag or currency I had some and can’t find them
[1:21:02] Stealy: ack you have too much good info ...whats the toy called?
[1:21:12] Husskarl: The NPCs are bit janky in Nokhud Offensive
[1:21:40] Shroomgirl81: It’s called endless possibility
[1:22:08] Zuldak: I bought the script before and its in my toy chest now. Im sad its a 1 hour CD and 1 hour buff now.
[1:22:22] Shroomgirl81: Ty ty hazel
[1:22:38] Dreyfusxano: Does anyone know the highest inspiration you can get on a tailor? I was able to max my crafting speed to a cap of 75% but I don't know about the other stats.
[1:22:40] Triskelian: Oh, this race is "fun". You have to go through the circles on the domes in a couple places
[1:22:48] Zuldak: pugs leaving keys mid dungeon, the true M+ experience
[1:22:56] wolfcloudchaser80: I was impressed the NPCs actually used the ballista to interrupt that one boss.
[1:23:07] Zuldak: before the scroll was a permanent buff you turned on or off
[1:23:55] witchhobbit: i still have the buff on my main
[1:24:01] McScooterson: now see, there I would have started over entirely
[1:24:05] adachi_akaso: how did you pick up the quest for the outland cup
[1:24:20] Zuldak: this one is super long
[1:24:30] VoxDawnbringer: this is really cool
[1:24:45] MaddiDJ4: @adachi_akaso I also grabbed it from the adventure journal
[1:25:18] Dreyfusxano: Nice swelling music during the race.
[1:25:18] Moriku: Oh no! You have to go back for it? >.<
[1:25:27] RigzDigz: Have they confirmed the dragon appearance glyph thing is account wide?
[1:26:02] Dreyfusxano: Ah cool.
[1:26:12] Triskelian: @RigzDigz I believe it is now
[1:26:25] Moriku: I love your hair today~ <3
[1:26:47] Kurama__95: I was pumping alchemy everyday, now the market plummeted and I'm stuck with 160k Hochenblooms LUL
[1:26:56] mazvegaswow: hazelLove
[1:27:03] Dreyfusxano: Even with a 75% crafting speed, unraveling tattered wildercloth takes a few hours.
[1:27:26] Moriku: This is such a great way to revisit old content
[1:27:42] wiigs3166: so doing the cup and just finishing is giving you those badges for the mogs and the toys?
[1:27:52] wiigs3166: or do you need gold?
[1:28:26] VoxDawnbringer: I'm thinking of playing WoW again. I haven't played Dragonflight yet. I heard at max level you can get pretty good gear even playing solo?
[1:28:30] Moriku: Thats a lot o_o
[1:28:48] wiigs3166: so alt army helps a ton?
[1:29:02] Dreyfusxano: @VoxDawnbringer That is fairly common for any WoW expansion.
[1:29:28] Moriku: Ohh what does it do?
[1:29:30] toothpick45: VoHiYo
[1:29:31] Kurama__95: I'm surprised how I've become a racing enthusiast, I'm maxed out gold on every race except ED
[1:29:54] Dreyfusxano: The toy randomizes your dragons customiztions
[1:30:25] Moriku: Wait - did it instantly summon your mount?
[1:30:37] Moriku: ooo LUL
[1:31:52] Dreyfusxano: I use all five colors, so I can imagine my team are power rangers. :D
[1:31:57] fknwaterpig: hazelTea
[1:32:24] HeylenR: does it use locked appearences or it doesnt use them?
[1:32:45] curative_wig: enjoying the stream wile raiding xD
[1:33:01] Kurama__95: I've gotten 3 Quantum Coursers so far, idk if I'm super lucky or if it's not that rare
[1:34:01] Kurama__95: I haven't farmed Rise specifically, got it while pushing score. Got 2 on my main and 1 on my alt (even on my 1st I already had every mount, so I gave those to someone in the group LUL )
[1:34:07] sence_00: It seems like a great way to get mounts, except I do not enjoy DOTI lol
[1:34:10] Moriku: Its so weird just walking through there XD
[1:34:21] Moriku: That bride of DOOM
[1:34:25] Moriku: *bridge
[1:34:54] monkeyslayer444: ew what boomkin race is that
[1:35:25] anker_jym: Are you still missing any of the Legion Raid mounts?
[1:35:34] Triskelian: @monkeyslayer444 I think it was one of the new boomie appearances you can get from the Emerald Dream
[1:36:03] witchhobbit: the new boomkins r great :(
[1:36:05] Moriku: XD That is a cute Boomy
[1:36:21] pet_pepi_rus: let it be known! it will drop today
[1:36:33] neimoose2: good afternoon everyone!! hazelWave
[1:36:45] witchhobbit: i really wanna see gnome boomie

[1:37:27] HeylenR: @haleych they'll look like carebears
[1:37:51] Berrymaqs: BFA def has some of my favorite music!
[1:37:52] Jaxameire: Tome of Teleportation
[1:38:11] victoryvix: fractured necrolyte skull
[1:38:36] Dreyfusxano: Is there going to be a flight path heirloom book for Dragonflight?
[1:38:40] ViresinDeum: hazelWave
[1:38:53] Stealy: ok im back kinda..Endless Possibilty toy..let me look that up...on a break
[1:39:11] sence_00: @Dreyfusxano probably not since they said flight paths would be accnt wide in war within
[1:39:53] McScooterson: *twiddles thumbs*
[1:40:01] Dreyfusxano: Ah, gotcha
[1:40:15] Stealy: Ohhh... Vial of Endless Draconic Scales!!
[1:40:18] Qiaolian: *thumbs Twiddling*
[1:40:23] victoryvix: it was listed under misc and not toys on wowhead - grrrr - thanks again sis
[1:40:31] aliceimpala: Hello hazel im back lurking
[1:41:03] Dreyfusxano: I am so looking forward to the warband feature because I am a big altaholic.
[1:41:06] Robbill_: Hey Hazel, not had a chance to watch for a long time, your hair is amazing! Love the colour! Have you grown it back out or have I missed something? ahah
[1:41:10] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[1:41:10] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:41:17] AratreyaDoesThings: YOU GOT THIS HAZEL!!!
[1:41:21] anker_jym: Forgot to say, I like the shirt, Hazel. The color reminds me of a US Army t-shirt!
[1:41:23] Stealy: I still have get any of the skins
[1:41:28] Dreyfusxano: Its a nice wig
[1:41:38] Zuldak: maybe the real sharkbait are the friends we made along the way
[1:41:45] AratreyaDoesThings: I thought Sharkbait dropped off of first boss?
[1:41:48] Robbill_: Ahhhh, it is a very nice wig indeed!
[1:42:01] Zuldak: no its off last boss
[1:42:08] AratreyaDoesThings: that's probably it  :P
[1:42:21] Stealy: Also I hope to do my first dragon cup racing this weekend - missed the last couple.
[1:42:21] McScooterson: last boss, incentive not to leave dungeon
[1:42:23] Moriku: Man - that is a dream come true not to have to worry about hair. Its brilliant!
[1:42:49] victoryvix: I got ashes from the timewalking reward - was awesome
[1:42:58] AztraTheSupermage: I must have been really lucky to get Al'ar on my second try :-P
[1:43:02] Stealy: what is the maintanence specifically?
[1:43:06] Dreyfusxano: Good thinking
[1:43:17] victoryvix: felt like a cheat gift - but I had ran that to get it at least 1000 times
[1:43:32] victoryvix: at least it felt like 1000
[1:43:40] ACE_Vz: Any chance we can see you without it?
[1:43:45] Stealy: so are they sythetic hair/
[1:43:56] dicemeister23: hi hazel and chat! Hope everyone had a nice week
[1:44:24] Triskelian: I've heard you shouldn't use shampoo on synthetic wigs, you should use a solution of water and fabric softener
[1:44:26] Dreyfusxano: Have you attempted any BFA raids since 10.2.5? I heard they were supposed to get a tuning pass.
[1:44:29] FrootyPebble329: Ive been considering doing a wig
[1:44:31] Moriku: You look beautiful both ways plated1Heart
[1:44:36] AratreyaDoesThings: 2 harlans loaded dice. man i remember every hunter needing that trink.
[1:44:44] FrootyPebble329: ^^^^^^^^^
[1:44:48] pet_pepi_rus: the real sharkbait are the dice we gained along the way
[1:44:55] Stealy: It's a bit late for you at this point but can't you bank your own hair and have them made? or is that super pricey?
[1:45:05] McScooterson: Do you think you'll get into learning fancy pincurl sets for the short wigs?
[1:45:23] dakoto70: no you can't bank your own hair and have a wig made
[1:45:52] FrootyPebble329: Do you ever braid it?
[1:45:54] Zuldak: you could save Moose's hair and make that into a wig
[1:46:00] goplacidly56: Your natural curls were so pretty though also
[1:46:02] Zuldak: or wear his moose bunnies
[1:46:05] Stealy: Yes you are super curly! your natural is very lovely - but my sister has the same curl as you and it's been a battle for her all her life
[1:46:23] ActuallyArcane: My step sister is having a wig made with her own hair. She had to grow it out 3 times to get enough
[1:46:30] goplacidly56: You rocked the buzz also
[1:46:37] victoryvix: Dear - you are super cute either way - rock what you love
[1:46:59] murloc_kingkiller: Is there a way to catalyze the Aberrus tier set?
[1:47:11] FrootyPebble329: it looks lovely on you! Im curious about the color
[1:47:23] Zuldak: so curious inside baseball question: have you noticed a difference in view count with vs without the wigs?
[1:47:25] anker_jym: Would you ever get a bunny or a bird for a pet?
[1:47:33] cashthb: nice curly hair is way more atractive than traight tho, it looks more lush I guess
[1:47:34] McScooterson: I thiiiink you can get lfr or normal aberrus with the catalyst
[1:47:36] FrootyPebble329: yes the color of that one
[1:47:42] realtruer: forbidden reach items give nm gear, then u upgrade with blue item to heroic gear
[1:47:44] phritss: I love that wig on you.
[1:47:45] Kurama__95: @murloc_kingkiller Dreamsurge and Time Rift give Aberrus tier, Forbidden Reach tokens give Vault tier
[1:47:52] Stealy: Yeah you inspire me to try wigs - my older locks are very thin now so I can see in the future where wigs maybe an option..
[1:48:04] FrootyPebble329: I like the purple, but is there silver in there?
[1:48:15] tehl00py: sub goal: chat gets to pick your next wig? also do you feel like a pretty pretty princess?
[1:48:20] murloc_kingkiller: @Kurama__95 ah that makese sense, does it give lfr or norm?
[1:48:26] DoctorOgenki: inc parrot!
[1:48:26] Zuldak: yeah sub goals to buy more wigs :P
[1:48:28] FrootyPebble329: thank you!
[1:48:33] wolfcloudchaser80: The problem with view count now is that there is a drop active. That, and some WoW streamers have moved on to other new games, so if you want WoW, there's fewer options.
[1:48:34] BoogiePonderosa: "Dusty Lavender?"
[1:48:34] DoctorOgenki: 🐦
[1:48:42] AratreyaDoesThings: Loot that sharkbait!
[1:48:49] Ujai321: All hail princess Hazel
[1:48:57] Moriku: You should say YES because you are!
[1:48:58] McScooterson: *bets on it being blue*
[1:48:59] AratreyaDoesThings: D:
[1:49:03] DJYumene: Got a question: Do you plan to do fraykk guide? I run a casual team and we're going to start heroric prog soon. You're guides have always been the go-to because their clear and also the captions are great as well (our team is Deaf/HoH) - but there's no guide for the last boss, so I was just wondering.
[1:49:06] FrootyPebble329: here here!
[1:49:08] pet_pepi_rus: it’s a dreadlock wig
[1:49:09] Kurama__95: @murloc_kingkiller I'm not sure after S3, since they increased the ilvl from Time Rift and Dreamsurge pieces, but I would guess normal tint
[1:49:18] victoryvix: just be you sis
[1:49:19] Ujai321: You do have British ancestors, after all
[1:49:23] AratreyaDoesThings: I actually like the lighter tones on your hair, it matches your skin so well
[1:49:24] Zuldak: Well, if only more people could subscribe free with their amazon prime
[1:49:30] Ujai321: Like Anne Hathaway?
[1:49:36] McScooterson: If only
[1:49:57] Ujai321: Sub goals are not meant to be reached immediately, usually
[1:50:06] Moriku: Yetti outfit??? Where? How? That is adorable!
[1:50:18] phritss: Wait, which mount drops off him.
[1:50:22] Moriku: oooh! XDD
[1:50:22] FrootyPebble329: do you have an option for a year long sub?
[1:50:24] azrazil720: I'm sad I can't help the sun goal because I'm already subbed 😅
[1:50:24] asurrraaa: Have you tried Palworld ? my wife and I are trying it tonight. the hype drove me to buy it lmao
[1:50:25] Ujai321: I was gonna say 19 as well
[1:50:26] RigzDigz: I'm surprised the name Kid wasn't taken!
[1:50:31] phritss: Awh
[1:50:35] BoogiePonderosa: Nightflame!
[1:50:39] FrootyPebble329: yes on twitch

[1:50:48] tehl00py: @djyumene she’s… working on it!
[1:50:59] AratreyaDoesThings: omg, all my friends are playing palworld right now
[1:51:04] FrootyPebble329: I dont think I would sub to anyone else lol you're the only one <3
[1:51:04] Ujai321: There is 6 months in advance, but also, it auto renews if you don't use prime
[1:51:07] Zuldak: I remember when blizz was saying they didnt want armor to cross armor types because they didnt want people confused by how a warrior might look like a mage.... and then they gave us the woolies and that went out the window
[1:51:09] AratreyaDoesThings: I look at my discord and it all says "Playing Palworld"
[1:51:13] asurrraaa: Niceeeeee !!! I’m excited. we will probably go from 6pm to 4 am !!! hahaha
[1:51:13] DJYumene: @tehl00py Thank you! I'm hard of hearing as well so I didn't hear on stream.
[1:51:24] eielwind: i think palworld might die out quite a bit soon but it has such big potential for updates
[1:51:38] asurrraaa: when we first tried Pokémon Unite (Pokémon MOBA) She was hooked !!! we played for like 8 hours lmao.
[1:51:54] Zuldak: the blood troll outfit is my go to
[1:51:59] Zuldak: but the jester is popular with rogues
[1:52:03] tehl00py: i hope the new wig is an undead style mohawk 🤘🏼
[1:52:03] Ujai321: It is the second most successful steam game ever, so, you know. Pretty good for a small studio
[1:52:10] Zuldak: yoiu are dps spec
[1:52:14] Dreyfusxano: I just want to have a "Casual warrior" outfit with my warrior going into a dungeon wearing a red shirt, jeans and shoes.
[1:52:29] DJYumene: djyumeILY
[1:52:30] AratreyaDoesThings: is this the only BFA mount drop you need? do u have Atal Dazar and Underrots?
[1:52:31] FrootyPebble329: you dont use your own voice pack on DBM!!!??? this is blasphemy!
[1:52:31] DJYumene: Thank you
[1:52:37] Fairshihtzu: What's that pop up with attempts after the boss? WA or addon?
[1:52:52] sence_00: I only remember which DH spec is which because the tank acronym is VDH and no one ever sayd HDH
[1:52:56] eielwind: @Fairshihtzu Rarity
[1:52:56] Ujai321: Addon called rarity
[1:52:58] Dreyfusxano: Closest I have gotten is the red linen shirt, tux shoes, and tux pants.
[1:52:58] FrootyPebble329: bahahahhaha
[1:53:01] Fairshihtzu: ty <3
[1:53:03] asurrraaa: I wonder what’s the purpose behind the 20 second logout lol. I can’t stand ig
[1:53:19] Triskelian: @Dreyfusxano I have one of those! It's the top from the Valdrakken citizen transmog and the tuxedo pants. I can't remember what feet I have though
[1:54:04] Dreyfusxano: Checking my mog, all of my pants are legit plate pants and maybe one pair of actual pants.
[1:54:04] Hellm0uth: I have been trying for the mount in Stratholme with 180 attempts unfortunetly
[1:54:06] Moriku: That is an amazing way to keep track of everything!
[1:54:09] masej23: It could be that they want to make sure that you want to log out somewhere where you won't get rested xp
[1:54:20] Ujai321: Any updates on your alarm clock? Was that what gave you the energy for your new intro?
[1:54:28] phritss: I thought it went 2 4 6 8 who do we appreciate?
[1:54:29] Moriku: They brought the Strathholm mount back? I thought they took it away? o_o
[1:54:30] Dreyfusxano: Ill have to check those out.
[1:54:45] Triskelian: @Moriku The addon Hazel used? It's called Saved Instances
[1:55:02] phritss: Poor rabbit must be choking on all that red smoke.
[1:55:17] pet_pepi_rus: what new intro?
[1:55:19] Moriku: Trisk - tyvm!!
[1:55:25] Dreyfusxano: I want to create some machinima content that are WoW guides and I want it to be somewhat casual.
[1:55:51] Derickituuu: !drop
[1:55:56] Ujai321: Ok, but what about the alarm clock, tho. Also, hope you feel better now

[1:56:47] FrootyPebble329: question about that add-on that logs your dungeons for you, what is it? did I miss that being answered already?
[1:56:48] LKatey75: I have a floofy new alarm clock, I need to learn how to set it later than 5am though. Kitten life
[1:56:58] baerful1: !drop
[1:57:02] Triskelian: @FrootyPebble329 Saved Instances
[1:57:07] Moriku: That is smart... nee dto do that too - doom scroll way too much lately
[1:57:08] cashthb: the neighbour has a cock that always starts to crow at midnight... not a huge a fan
[1:57:10] Terra___l: still no news about the ptr...
[1:57:29] FrootyPebble329: so just look up "Savedinstances" in curseforge?
[1:57:35] FrootyPebble329: thank you so much for taking the time <3
[1:57:37] Ujai321: The chastity box!
[1:57:41] tehl00py: tehl00py subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! i need that alarm clock with wheels that makes you get up to shut it off. so good for chronic snoozers.
[1:57:41] Streamlabs: tehl00py just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:58:19] Dreyfusxano: Putting an alarm away from your bed is great to force you out of bed. I've done that a few times.
[1:58:21] maros_petrus: you should logout out of instance
[1:58:25] Moriku: lol!
[1:58:26] Ujai321: If you kick it out of your room, make sure it has a good bumper on it
[1:58:31] chupathingi: why not just pay a man to slap you
[1:58:33] sence_00: I used to have mine in the hallway so I had to really get out of bed
[1:58:35] Moriku: ooooh! Gladiator belf! :O
[1:58:41] Runzi333: love that mog hahaha nice
[1:58:44] tehl00py: cuckoo clock alarm sounds awesome
[1:58:46] Moriku: Omg that outfit *_*
[1:58:47] Hellm0uth: Is the rivendare's deathcharger not in Stratholme anymore or a super low drop rate?
[1:58:52] nyrhalahotep: they make an alarm clock with wheels that jumps off your nightstand and runs away from you when you try to shut it off
[1:58:52] Vesamora: why would you say a thing like that
[1:58:52] azrazil720: I once knew a guy that rigged his alarm to drop a wet sponge on his head
[1:58:54] McScooterson: this mog is a mood and a half
[1:58:55] FrootyPebble329: we need a Gromit alarm clock from Wallace and Gromit
[1:59:04] Ujai321: Can you try something very stupid for me on the character screen?
[1:59:09] Dreyfusxano: Cheeeeeese
[1:59:10] LKatey75: Kitten jumping on your chest and yelling at the top of his lungs, new alarm clock, needs snooze button
[1:59:13] wolfcloudchaser80: There's an alarm that flings a light object out into your room and won't shut off until you find and replace that object.
[1:59:19] Gurottesquex: @FrootyPebble329 That sounds amazing omg.
[1:59:32] FrootyPebble329: RIGHT?!
[1:59:43] chupathingi: do you have the rustfeather mount?
[1:59:45] FrootyPebble329: I would definitely buy that.....
[1:59:54] chupathingi: awwww
[2:00:00] anker_jym: I believe I use to have an alarm clock that got louder the longer you let it go
[2:00:03] cashthb: an alarm clock app that matches you with randos on your choice of dating up if you don't wake up in time would be such a win
[2:00:19] Ujai321: If you rotate your paladin a little to the right, I wonder if you can make it look like... You know, he has the worst UTI ever
[2:00:22] FrootyPebble329: MY husband had an alarm clock that sounded like a rocket taking off
[2:00:22] pet_pepi_rus: there’s one alarm that just launches you out of bed like a catapult
[2:00:24] Hellm0uth: Okay ty. I'm at 180 attempts for it lol
[2:00:34] FrootyPebble329: he was a heavy sleeper
[2:00:36] Ujai321: I said it was stupid!
[2:00:50] little_hamlet: hazelLurk hazelLurk
[2:01:02] Zuldak: im surprised moose isnt an alarm in the morning
[2:01:04] Moriku: Oh yes - o_o That would upset hubby
[2:01:19] FrootyPebble329: sleep kitty!
[2:01:22] janahita: I also am the struggle lmao
[2:01:23] McScooterson: moose is growing boy and needs much sleep
[2:01:30] Runzi333: my partner got up for work at like 6 so up and moving to get ready at 5 am and we just do that now rip lol
[2:01:37] MaddiDJ4: I’m only functional because I calculate my sleep cycles. really eliminates grogginess you’d be surprised
[2:01:39] eielwind: moose is me
[2:01:43] Moriku: Does this dungeon have to be set for mythic for the toy?
[2:01:52] phritss: I thought moose was a person at first.
[2:01:54] Gurottesquex: Moose is so valid for that
[2:02:01] Triskelian: You're getting transmog at least :D
[2:02:15] chupathingi: there mother love them
[2:02:17] Ujai321: He is almost as tall and heavy as a person

[2:03:19] padakins: i had my cat for 14 years..... it passed away. sucks
[2:03:20] NotLebronJamess: decided to quit playing meta M+ classes and just commit to my OG warrior to farm stuff
[2:03:21] anker_jym: Time to level another Druid ;)
[2:03:22] Gurottesquex: I once had a friend who had a blind cat that would like going to busy places with his harness b/c he'd lay in the middle of groups and just get all the pets lol
[2:03:49] ArroArroArro: Damn, not been here in a while. Love the hair. Looking good.  Hows everyone
[2:03:55] Ujai321: Are you past the "wait an hour" mission table part in the campaign?

[2:06:04] kynlaeh: my partner also fixes the toys after they’ve been destroyed and he tells our puppy that they’re in surgery and she will sit there patiently will they get stitched
[2:06:06] soupxhot: bumper car

[2:07:31] sence_00: oh man I had a mage griefing our team this morning in SS - I think everyone reported them tho
[2:07:32] murloc_kingkiller: does the tier set not apply in pvp?
[2:07:36] Runzi333: it's a little like bendy plastic thing that goes in front of them so that bumps into things instead of their faces
[2:08:23] eielwind: i wonder why your gladius isnt working, i use it as well and it seems to be ok
[2:08:38] Marmoh: Do you have a favorite pvp game?
[2:09:13] Gurottesquex: The little Treants looked like they were just vibin in the middle of the fight lol

[2:17:21] McScooterson: @dicemeister23 caverns only has 2 or 3 mounts so not terrible?

[2:19:33] McScooterson: but yeah, there's rep vendor, few drops, the treasure
[2:19:37] anker_jym: Hazel, do you prefer dungeon healing or raid healing? I think I'd be more comfortable in a raid since I'm not the only healer
[2:19:48] dicemeister23: is loam niffen rep relatively easy?
[2:20:01] 7thSaga: BAM
[2:20:19] Astareal86: !lurk
[2:20:33] dicemeister23: @saviorofazeroth I know you are asking Hazel but from personal experience I prefer dungeon healing because nobody is comparing you to anyone else, if you are keeping everyone alive then you're good lol

[2:21:37] anker_jym: @dicemeister23 I guess that's a fair point. I know I'm guilty of comparing myself on the damage meters, for example. I guess the only competition you would have in dungeons is a Blood DK tank lol

[2:22:23] Hobbz_CBG: Love your content, keep it coming :)
[2:22:25] Gilfynavota72527: for some reason yesterday I tried equipping 421 wand on my warlock and it lowered my level instead of increasing it?
[2:23:11] Moriku: Liive lock! Liiiive!
[2:23:37] anker_jym: @gilfynavota72527 Were you equipping a two hander previously? The way the averages work, to match a two hander's ilvl, you would need a wand and an offhand
[2:24:26] Gurottesquex: I didnt realize destro lock was good in pvp, youve been running into a lot of them :O
[2:24:45] Moriku: GG!!!!
[2:24:47] furiforever: In another episode of Hazel teaches me druid PVP, TIL that travel form stops repentance....

[2:25:49] furiforever: still not great at it
[2:26:26] y2krissy: I just wanted to say thank you so much for your raid guides. They helped me so much!
[2:26:43] AratreyaDoesThings: wait... so Hazel is actually your birth name?!?
[2:26:44] Gilfynavota72527: @saviorofazeroth yeah how does work because I’m kinda new and never equipped a offhand only my left Main hand is equipped?
[2:26:52] Zuldak: When TWW comes out you should release the Fyrrak guide out of spite
[2:27:33] ItsArrathan: Hi Hazel! I have a question! I just dismissed my Voidwalker and he just had a new bit of a dialogue that I'd never heard before. Do we know of new demon dialogue?

[2:28:07] McScooterson: bless you for running a slutmog on the plate wearer
[2:28:11] stanbjork1: is wow worth getting back to rn?
[2:28:15] ItsArrathan: It got me very intrigued seeing as void is going to play a big part soon
[2:28:24] pet_pepi_rus: I remember when right click dismissing my imp, he would do this funny Karen complain
[2:28:34] Illium1989: Waht is that Addon?
[2:28:38] Illium1989: what*
[2:29:17] Dreyfusxano: Its definitely helpful when I have to juggle quest chains 2-3 times to find the one chain I need to be on.
[2:30:05] Dreyfusxano: @stanbjork1 I would say yes, but that answer depends on what you like doing.
[2:30:13] Illium1989: Ah nice! Looked like an addon for the dungeon journal
[2:30:29] anker_jym: @gilfynavota72527 Bear in mind I could be talking out of my butt, but as far as I know, they lump two One-Handed weapons, or one Main Hand Weapon and an Offhand, into one item in terms of stats and ilvl average. I'm not totally sure how the coding works, but it prevents people who use One-Handers from being too OP
[2:31:01] Hellm0uth: I have had to use that addon while doing quests in Daza'alor, mind you had to look through a ton of quest lines
[2:31:31] Zuldak: there is a weird mog from M+ darkheart thicket for palies
[2:31:41] Veranteja: evening hazel and chat

[2:34:23] sence_00: I want Nazjatar puzzles
[2:34:28] Kaltaer: Withered Training was a lot of fun too
[2:34:40] Zuldak: I liked the old bejeweled puzzles
[2:34:53] Waggzy: Waggzy subscribed with Prime. 
[2:34:53] Streamlabs: waggzy just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:34:59] Dreyfusxano: I never got that fox mount from that training
[2:35:03] Zuldak: I do not miss the turtle tower defense
[2:35:05] pet_pepi_rus: what’s the point of a follower in a delve if he won’t say “Awww…. I don’t smell anything!” in a southern accent?
[2:35:12] ArthuzadTV: Hi Hazel how are you today ? Good evening from France ❤️
[2:35:17] Waggzy: Your raid guides helped me get a main spot in a Mythic guild. Thank you!
[2:35:24] Thyrox4ever: A turtle made it to the water !
[2:35:29] Zuldak: no its was the one on the shore and you had to shoot the birds and crabs
[2:36:37] Zuldak: I remember they got Ion to comment on the mass enviromental destruction we were causing by saving ALL the turtles and the millions of crabs and seagulls we culled
[2:36:43] Zuldak: not ion ghostcrawler
[2:36:51] ArthuzadTV: What are you farming today ?
[2:36:53] Thyrox4ever: uuh there is a gacha one I play called arknights
[2:36:55] Dreyfusxano: Ever play Orcs Must Die?
[2:37:02] pet_pepi_rus: scrollsage Nola thankfully doesn’t need our help protecting the turtles anymore, thanks to the gnomes, new technology helps protect them, the Glock!
[2:37:02] sence_00: thats me with the DOTI no-death achieve. Can run that on an +18 until you tell me I cant die on a 0 and I just walk in to fire
[2:37:03] UltraDankNooner: i still play Bloons TD from time to time
[2:37:14] Getcha_Pulll: I hated those bowling rocks in in this dungeon in m+
[2:37:36] Zuldak: DOTI isnt bad honestly. I did a deathless run
[2:37:39] Waggzy: I just did that quest line.  I am now a Highlord 🤣
[2:37:40] zigwood: This makes me want to finish my pally quest chain as well
[2:37:48] y2krissy: Are there any achieves you are wanting to get done before DF ends?
[2:38:02] Zuldak: the thing is that it's buggy. You have to carry these time things and they can disappear
[2:38:03] tiberiusmason: tiberiusmason subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[2:38:03] Streamlabs: tiberiusmason just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:38:19] Dreyfusxano: Was there any word on profession points catch up?
[2:38:27] Zuldak: The group i did the deathless run with was disgustingly over geared. I am 484 ilvl and was the least geared
[2:38:56] anker_jym: Instead of a jelly cat, what if the fated mount is a jelly dragon??
[2:38:57] Zuldak: Was a 488 warrior who was trucking
[2:39:16] Zuldak: Im on the duck boat
[2:39:18] UltraDankNooner: jelly duck?
[2:39:20] TheRealBoghy: Why not a penguin
[2:39:23] anker_jym: Jelly duck
[2:39:40] Zuldak: You have to do the hard mode
[2:39:52] Zuldak: its not just deathless, its deathless hard mode
[2:40:02] mithrill007: oh wow, your hair looks amazing
[2:40:10] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[2:40:10] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:40:18] Qiaolian: Peanut Butter Porcupine
[2:40:37] Matooba: Hooray! got my drop. Thanks Hazel. I still watch your streams even with no drops.
[2:40:52] sence_00: it gives you all the infinite mog
[2:40:54] wren1103: no mount, transmog set
[2:41:31] Zuldak: its the infinite dragonflight version of the season 2 set
[2:41:41] Gurottesquex: Do you get all of the sets when you do it or just the set for the class you do it on?
[2:42:01] Zuldak: you get it for all
[2:42:04] sence_00: you get all armour types ya
[2:42:21] Gurottesquex: Oh fr? Thats good to know ty
[2:42:30] Getcha_Pulll: do they ever change KSM mount from season to season other than recolor?
[2:43:31] dicemeister23: I loved the restoration keystone mount from shadowlands, can't go wrong with pruple and gold lol
[2:43:50] wren1103: inferno by far
[2:43:53] Illium1989: Season 2 for sure
[2:43:54] OGSceneBoy: Yo is destro any good in this patch?
[2:43:55] realtruer: 2nd season
[2:44:01] sence_00: Fire for sure
[2:44:06] Kaltaer: The Inferno one looks super good
[2:44:06] buusalmighty82: The inferno is awesome
[2:44:11] Dreyfusxano: I got sick when Dragonflight launched and that semi ruined my momentum getitng started.
[2:44:11] Illium1989: I wasn't playing season 1 unfortunately
[2:44:19] Illium1989: Would have fit my pally mog perfectly
[2:44:26] Gurottesquex: The icy one would have been so cool with icy antlers or something
[2:44:30] ellasky: I'd rather not share my feelings toward this mount lol
[2:44:32] Kaltaer: I wish the Hailstorm Armoredon had similar effects to the fire one
[2:44:37] Qiaolian: WPould be cool if it left fire foot prints.
[2:44:44] dicemeister23: I missed season 2 and did not get season 3 yet, had a  baby and now I am back lol. She is finally sleeping through the night so I can start dungeoning again
[2:45:01] witchhobbit: i think that is shadowlands in a nutshell. covid was the biggest issue for me
[2:45:09] witchhobbit: but i do like shadowlands
[2:45:12] Gurottesquex: Oh wait yeah the footprints would have been cool. Maybe the green one could have left those druid flowers or something
[2:45:22] sence_00: the running animation is not great
[2:45:39] cashthb: their old walking was soo much better, I don't get why they have to ruin every animation, rip old ammoths
[2:45:55] dicemeister23: I always pick the flower train in superblooms I agree they should add this to a mount lol
[2:45:56] MaddiDJ4: I feel an opportunity was missed not making a storm one. maybe next season
[2:46:02] Gurottesquex: It was nice that the Shadowlands ones flew
[2:46:03] murloc_kingkiller: I dont like how wow is all about grinding currencies but then i played GW2s... where the currencies are locked behind content you cant even access lol
[2:46:07] sence_00: the SL ones are what finally got me to run M+ I adore them
[2:46:44] dicemeister23: I missed the red shadwlands mount so that sucks but I'll get over it someday lol
[2:46:48] chupathingi: they have toned it down and its nicer now
[2:47:06] anker_jym: As long as they don't take up bag space lol
[2:47:09] witchhobbit: same, i don't mind lol
[2:47:26] MaddiDJ4: without currency we’re left with… random drops CaitlynS
[2:47:30] Dreyfusxano: I agree.
[2:47:39] cashthb: wait, yet again... we don't have valor, BRING BACK VALOR
[2:47:41] Kaltaer: Mechagon was the worst for bag space lol
[2:47:48] BoogiePonderosa: yeah SL currency numbed my brain
[2:47:49] aceorcent: Still hate the primal stones & untapped forbidden knowledge... they upgrade the same thing and ONLY that thing and one is bag but one is currency???
[2:47:54] aceorcent: like explain that
[2:47:57] wolfcloudchaser80: WoW seems to flip back and forth between wrecking your bags with junk, then "fixing" the problem via currency tab, then going back to ultra-clutter.
[2:48:05] anker_jym: @kaltaer I dunno, Zskera Vaults was pretty bad
[2:48:11] zigwood: I dont mind currencies but there's too many. I'm always forgetting to spend them
[2:48:39] HalcyonBeing: why does they keep removing Valor anyways? They keep reincarnating it from older expansions and then removing it. What do they consider wrong with their systems for it?
[2:48:47] Kaltaer: @saviorofazeroth true, I didnt really do a lot of it, but I heard stories lol
[2:48:56] HalcyonBeing: i only know it from mop a bit, tbh
[2:49:03] BoogiePonderosa: my drop is done! now i just need to figure out what a Grim Campfire is..
[2:49:09] shootidruidy: there are two different sections of table quests doing those class halls. hated it
[2:49:21] HalcyonBeing: right, but the whole "if it aint broke..." so what's wrong with it?
[2:49:24] realtruer: flightstones are so unecessary imo
[2:49:32] Qiaolian: Yeah, got my Grim Campfire Toy
[2:49:33] Dreyfusxano: Does Craftsim only scan Dragonflight recipes?
[2:49:33] HalcyonBeing: flightstones feel so much worse
[2:49:55] JustBlazeX: only problem with flightstones is the 2k cap
[2:50:10] MaddiDJ4: I like that I can upgrade my pve gear. cap does suck though
[2:50:23] Dreyfusxano: I am glad there is a way to spend them once DF becomes Legacy content.
[2:50:24] Gurottesquex: The cap feels awful if you do any form of end game content
[2:50:29] HalcyonBeing: my problem with flightstones is the unnecessary complication of crests. it feels awful bringing friends into retail and explaining an unnecessarily complicated system. it doesn't swell well
[2:50:36] slimshadyafk: @Hazel, I need a new chair. Mine is killing my back.  What’s yours? and do you recommend? Ty.
[2:50:37] HalcyonBeing: sell*
[2:50:40] wowfreshman: samant68PupHi  Hello Hazel and all.  Hazel I like your new look.
[2:50:49] Senorplez: hazelCry
[2:50:57] aceorcent: the cap is painful :(( ive spent 4000 or so on reputation now just to use them
[2:51:05] Dreyfusxano: You can spend them on rep tokens that can be sent to alts.
[2:51:17] Gurottesquex: Same with my warlock and priest and it feels so weird that we CANT send them to alts at this point in the xpac ;_;
[2:51:25] FifiBelle_: Is that the chair that they hand make to order?
[2:51:28] murloc_kingkiller: i think you should be able to choose a reward at the end of every 3rd m+ dungeon. I've gotten a cloak on AD 3x in a row >:(
[2:51:29] MaddiDJ4: @aceorcent where’s the rep vendor if I may ask?
[2:51:53] goplacidly56: Son has one and loves it
[2:51:53] slimshadyafk: I’m willing to pay honestly. My old back is hating mine.
[2:51:53] HalcyonBeing: i couldn't decide between embody and aeron
[2:51:59] HalcyonBeing: picked aeron
[2:52:23] pyrexmeasurincup: yeah those things are priced at both kidneys and one arm :D
[2:52:41] aceorcent: @MaddiDJ4 I go to the forbidden reach and spend them there, since the 4 main ones are there
[2:52:56] MaddiDJ4: ahh thank you!
[2:53:12] slimshadyafk: @halcyonbeing you liking it I assume?
[2:53:14] greshnik__666: i like the mog :)
[2:53:22] Elrathir: Immobilized? shoulda thought of that before my freedom went on cooldown
[2:53:28] kalinaah: does dispelling them or bop work?
[2:53:47] syriusdots: if you have alts you can spend flight stones on 441 account bound item.
[2:53:55] HalcyonBeing: @slimshadyafk it's good, if you run hot, but i do question if i should have gotten the embody. the plastic on the edge can be a bit hard in comparison to the rest of the chair
[2:54:00] murloc_kingkiller: I also wish gem + armor enchants did more than just (give x value) and rather create unique/fun effects in combat
[2:54:25] kalinaah: Cleanse toxins i think :o
[2:54:44] syriusdots: yeah it’s 1000 rating not too bad.
[2:54:44] slimshadyafk: @halcyonbeing kk good to know ty!
[2:54:52] anker_jym: I started a huge leveling challenge last week. I made a Draenei Shaman and will be level locking them so that I can level in every zone, in every xpac, in chronological order. I'm expecting this to take a long time, possibly into the War Within. But it should be fun, gonna be doing campaigns and quests I haven't done in years.
[2:54:52] HalcyonBeing: @slimshadyafk they're good chairs. but which good chair is better is hard to know.
[2:54:53] marbared: wait; you have a pally?!?
[2:55:34] JunkeeTheFunkee: @HazelNuttyGames have a guild question for you, how do you go about finding members to replace people who drop out through the life of the expansion?
[2:55:43] conksalot: @saviorofazeroth OMG. I started doing this exact thing with a Human Paladin.
[2:55:50] anker_jym: Yeah, Mail is my least collected armor type, so there's that Transmog collection bonus as well
[2:56:09] anker_jym: @conksalot Best of luck, fellow loremaster lol!
[2:56:18] murloc_kingkiller: @saviorofazeroth how do you level lock?
[2:56:36] JunkeeTheFunkee: thank you! love the content!
[2:56:37] slimshadyafk: @halcyonbeing yea I think I’ll go for broke and get embody then
[2:57:11] HalcyonBeing: know people with it who love it, and i know people with aeron who love them to. go with your gut, i'd say. my wife and i both have aerons
[2:57:12] furiforever: Probably where u freed the glowing dude
[2:57:24] anker_jym: @murloc_kingkiller There's an NPC in Stormwind or Orgrimmar that you can talk to that turns off your XP. I can't remember there names of the top of my head. I think the Stormwind one is in the castle
[2:57:36] slimshadyafk: oh sweet thanks!
[2:57:44] HalcyonBeing: @slimshadyafk yeah try them out for sure. i liked all the features the aeron came with. a lot of customization. like lean forward, lumbar, arms, etc
[2:58:23] HalcyonBeing: if you're going to spend a bunch of money on a chair, you might as well add the bells and whistles, and know you'll like it
[2:58:32] Tac2cul: @JunkeeTheFunkee what we tend to do is post twice in chat, and use *** recruitment, that usually nets us a few people for trials
[2:58:45] Dreyfusxano: I never understood why relics couldn't be vendored, like Shadowlands conduits that I get two of at a time.
[2:58:55] HalcyonBeing: @JunkeeTheFunkee i hear there are recruitment discords for servers
[2:59:05] Zuldak: one day Anthus is gonna summon Blanchy and get eatten
[3:00:26] HalcyonBeing: maraad would have been here peepoSad
[3:00:40] cashthb: you needed to buy a lot of the order hall set if I recall correctly
[3:01:03] HalcyonBeing: didn't they give you them all by the end?
[3:02:06] Dreyfusxano: It was like the first night elf paladin apparently?
[3:02:11] murloc_kingkiller: I still havent unlocked flying in Zereth Mortis and idk if i want to lol
[3:02:32] anker_jym: @halcyonbeing No, some were rep locked, at least one was locked by completing all the Legion dungeons, and I think there was an Artifact Weapon grind too
[3:03:34] dicemeister23: I just got tattered dreamleaf quest. Can you please explain like I'm 5? Should I abandon? I tried to do quick check on wowhead
[3:03:44] HalcyonBeing: huh. i recall the lockouts. just though they threw it at you at the end.
[3:04:16] dicemeister23: It looks like it's part of legendary axe chain
[3:04:33] zigwood: thank you!
[3:04:35] goplacidly56: bye
[3:04:39] HalcyonBeing: bye!
[3:04:41] anker_jym: Bye!
[3:04:46] aceorcent: ty for the stream!
[3:04:47] dicemeister23: bye hazel!
[3:04:49] witchhobbit: bye!!! love the new ending screen hehe
[3:04:51] Matooba: bye thanks for the stream
[3:05:17] Stealy: bye every one!
