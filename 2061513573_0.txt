[4:50:21] yoso22bc: Just bring boss at the entrance there is a botten that tanks can secure and the other botten on the other piler can healer secure. Dps should be in the middle then you have enough time to click or kill the bomb till bombs reach tanks or boss
[4:50:24] Ceodewd: Bromorin go back to na
[4:50:31] wwombology: You should have ur sham tank go dps. Use maelstrom to offheal

[4:55:36] edi_the_don: @Guzu your damage is very low. I dont understand are you a tank or a DPS?

[4:56:24] ryude: We found that meta locks are really good at dealing with bombs and button since they can move while spamming searing pain. So meta and a mage on main button duty with other healers/ranged filling in if needed due to debuff made it super manageable

[6:24:06] Supibot: boneyards_666, 😦 Outlook not so good.
[6:24:09] artilectXLII: feels like fighting by the altar & continuously delivering the blood might be the move as you cannot lost any on death as you have nothing to lose as it was delivered seconds ago
[6:24:11] jbarish: feels like everyone is in nax gear already lol
[6:24:12] ashtaroxx: plunk suuuure

[6:24:38] Curtsy: Guzu has my dad locked up in a shed, he's been feeding him nothing but salty licorice for fifteen years PepeHands
[6:24:48] Rixxey: its also very dead compared to launch so the lag is gone
[6:24:48] saitama1312: WHAT ABOUT GET LAYERED
[6:24:52] Ewriick: @Curtsy lucky man
[6:24:53] Evoulz: @Guzu So opting out is just garbage.. really.... Why am I still in the middle of a blood moon parties which can still kill me??? Why not have an own layer for opted out players, so stv becomes like old school stv? just horde vs horde, nothing else.
[6:24:54] pcg151: ele Kreygasm

[6:25:17] viciouswx: You remember? Pepperidge Farm remembers: https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousGoodBearSSSsss-E5ipADbUdwHkzuFS
[6:25:22] thefoxborough69: Guzu keeps the mods family locked up in his sheed, and he only feeds them licorice peepoWhy
[6:25:31] Rahmulous: I would prefer if they got rid of groups. Every healer has a viable dps spec now so fuck healing. FFA is FFA.
[6:25:32] Mr_Moffert: you cant get killed by your factio either
[6:25:33] lewizroy: Do you get HKs/Honor towards ranking for the event?
[6:25:34] Curtsy: Opting out is for PvE servers pretty much I guess
[6:25:37] claudioproys: @Guzu you could have figure that out 123 deaths ago xD
[6:25:37] smallchaange: chat, stop posting juvinale shit
[6:25:38] Vertigo_GB: PVE server is fine
[6:25:38] insaniacc_: your own faction cant attack you
[6:25:39] Rixxey: your own faction cant kill you at least
[6:25:47] Ewriick: @Evoulz I honestly think its either devs thinking is "its still a pvp server, get fked" or "pvp zones are so deeply nested in the code, cant be bothered"
[6:25:48] Ceodewd: @thefoxborough69 Mod me NAOW!
[6:25:51] Vertigo_GB: Its like normal STV

[6:26:21] Curtsy: (he doesn't feel bad at all)
[6:26:24] Evoulz: @guzu That's just the thing, they don't get anything for killing me when im opted out. so hordes get nothing at all. neither honor OR bloods. so why kill opted out players? you don't get anything.
[6:26:25] mjs010: Sounds like bannable kill trading to me ;)
[6:26:25] EnyoHC: dont be sorry, its just quota members. they deserve it
[6:26:30] Rahmulous: The bigger issue with the STV event for people wanting to opt out is that they eliminated hyperspawns so it takes days to do a single kill quest in STV
[6:26:30] ahwee: rise up against guzu Quota peepoRiot
[6:26:32] H00kemH0rns: ScamZu at it again

[6:31:56] Curtsy: They should disable grouping during blood moon and see how much fun people have then :)
[6:32:02] stoneage450: gnomer time
[6:32:05] Ceodewd: The Gole?
[6:32:07] mostlikelyyadad: @guzu devs said when you group there’s consequences whats the difference being alone I didn’t see anything crazy different
[6:32:07] mackattack4208: Guzu this is the weapon: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=216495/sanguine-crusher
[6:32:16] smorgo32: nah its good

[6:32:28] artilectXLII: ...they could scatter gurubashi-chests all over STV while the event is going on 🧐🤔
[6:32:28] Arthident: they should do groups on different layer as solo players
[6:32:28] Rixxey: @mostlikelyyadad they're talking about large groups
[6:32:30] Kurama__95: No grouping means healers need to respec to do the event
[6:32:31] Curtsy: Them naming it FFA and allowing grouping is kind of weird
[6:32:34] LemenTozen: and get like 1/8th of the blood as solo
[6:32:37] dani_dorko: better with the changes, but not being able to mount as a warlock or paladin is bs
[6:32:40] booddhi: Are anyone above seargent rank?
[6:32:44] Blufootgaming: guzu what can i complain about now in wow
[6:32:48] Boneyards_666: deleted

[6:32:48] Rixxey: @Curtsy if ur not in a group its FFA

[6:32:53] viciouswx: RiP
[6:32:58] Ceodewd: Ooooof that corpse run
[6:33:00] LemenTozen: they should buff the blood you get as solo and scale with party size
[6:33:00] roberttlight: did you guys down the last boss?
[6:33:01] GallowayOW: what do you think the next event will look like? we got boss rush, we got ffa now what
[6:33:07] Curtsy: @Rixxey Yes, but traditionally in games FFA means you cannot group
[6:33:08] mackattack4208: Peggers
[6:33:11] Boneyards_666: LUL
[6:33:16] JohnJustGaming: @Guzu Yesterday I got the crit cape on my hunter and had to clear the vendor out with a frost trap/explosive trap w/ trap launcher lol
[6:33:17] roberttlight: chads <3
[6:33:26] booddhi: Are anyone above seargent?
[6:33:28] thisautumn: paidchatter
[6:33:29] Rixxey: @Curtsy true, the term isn't completely accurate
[6:33:30] crag_h: what is the hardest part of gnomer?
[6:33:31] JohnJustGaming: It was hilarious it was like the catalyst that set the ally to attack
[6:33:32] cooclo: what was your strat on last boss
[6:33:39] mostlikelyyadad: did any epics drop
[6:33:45] ScovieJ: when did the lvl 40 increase happen? I've been out of the game for a while
[6:33:47] nax1: whats hard about him?
[6:33:48] hushbang: Any loots?
[6:33:49] EpicShot: interupting on classic oh no
[6:33:53] nax1: isnt it a joke compared to wotlk
[6:33:55] Ceodewd: mostlikelyyadad The questitem for Epic neck dropped
[6:33:58] GallowayOW: think of the casual dads
[6:33:59] Rixxey: did they add a cast bar at least
[6:34:00] Trexbo_: iAsk Guzu what are your thoughts on limiting the groups to 3 man? Sort of like arena or typical battle royale?
[6:34:03] Willestroker: its more of a range fight for last boss
[6:34:11] roberttlight: I had two warriors in my group and it felt rough. What is up with the armor with the last boss?
[6:34:12] Curtsy: One thing I will say, Gnomer makes a much better raid than BFD did, the size of Gnomer already feels like a raid
[6:34:13] CamGG__: which is what the devs want, they want people to clear it
[6:34:18] cooclo: we felt like our tanks were taking soo much damage
[6:34:20] caffeinerushhh: yea its a tank/range fight. Melee just go ham
[6:34:23] Chlamydious: he said phase 3 POGGIES
[6:34:27] caffeinerushhh: and healer fight ofc
[6:34:28] Frollomir: Fury or Arms specc for warrior?
[6:34:32] Pegazuss5: was a pleasure to kill and be killed by you guzu <3
[6:34:32] GallowayOW: would be 3 shadow priests
[6:34:33] LemenTozen: just make the amount of blood you get scale with party size

[6:39:24] m1cke90: Rogues would stealth around stealing kills
[6:39:25] Curtsy: It's actually not, I 100% think you could group invite macro abuse to exploit that
[6:39:27] AdamAnt7: they would be solo but in a grp EZ
[6:39:28] caffeinerushhh: win trading would be way easier with solo double coins
[6:39:28] Blufootgaming: so rogues get 2x coins and healers suffer
[6:39:29] TakisC00: @SirHeiska Teach me to read have a conversation :)
[6:39:30] Blufootgaming: gg

[6:39:50] TakisC00: I think its alright to have some content you need to group for
[6:39:52] Eleith: ppl would find a way to macro /invite and leave group to every ability, getting more coins lmao
[6:39:54] cabo_chris: it’s an mmo, go out there and find a group, meet friends
[6:39:55] Huertix: also rogues are the solo class so sounds fine
[6:40:03] Yvernaa: quantHmm
[6:40:03] Infractus1: the lag tho :<
[6:40:03] Lohai: can we do old AV for next phase
[6:40:04] draqcula: Actually Guzu the trick is to hug the raid boss in STV and get the buff so you get alot more coins per kill
[6:40:06] TakisC00: People dont really complain about needing to group for dungeons
[6:40:06] AdamAnt7: always cry babies no matter what
[6:40:17] TakisC00: Warlocks can mount though, they just gotta buy one

[6:41:58] Salazar_Storm: @guzu the way they fixed it was the Best fix for the the last ampunt of dev houers. The other "fixes" will take to much time. And probably won't be prioritized
