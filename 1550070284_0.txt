[1:42:42] luckfore: thats cool
[1:43:05] amysz: holy fuk that's cool
[1:43:15] NickyNiclas: It's so fast lol
[1:43:18] Sollice: Is that at 900%
[1:43:29] Sollice: If so that is way too fast and which is why its good they are slowing it
[1:43:33] Tripl3dot: thats sick
[1:43:35] JediNeo99999: I don't think the race courses were updated for the turning changes to dragonriding
[1:43:43] heavymetal92: its lap based

[1:44:40] NickyNiclas: Yeah he can't keep track of every little ting
[1:44:51] heavymetal92: what zones opens today?
[1:44:52] NBK_Sethus: now just let us race for gold
[1:44:59] Sollice: @Towelliee He is a lawyer...Lies are more natural than truths
[1:45:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you can dismount other racers, that's badass
[1:45:16] alucard3zz: are the live serves down? @Towelliee

[1:48:41] mayonaes: When does your starter kit go on sale?
[1:48:42] Sollice: Moobot thinks its a website
[1:48:54] Sollice: I think I can fix that
[1:49:01] Ekazz: @Sollice ikr. Just typed it like I was saying it haha. Thanks tho.
[1:49:09] tawney_owl_: Sounds like dan ackyroid
[1:49:10] kharditv: advance is good better than g fuel
[1:49:19] Finiin: I never tried any of these drink mixes before, what flavor do you recommend?
[1:49:20] HaloS23: what is the company again?
[1:49:20] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |

[1:49:28] Tjenne92: do they ship internationally ?
[1:49:30] Jey1h: @Stopnsmellmynutz the new crafting didnt really "steal" from ff14 much

[1:49:58] Ekazz: So like I said (before I got timeout lol); I tried both for a couple years, and for any of you who don't know advanced gg; it's so much better then Gfuel TBH.
[1:50:11] JediNeo99999: @Stopnsmellmynutz also pretty much created a genre with diablo so....
[1:50:13] Jynt334: Jynt334 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months! Can't wait for the Expansion!
[1:50:18] zenkodac: "steal" as if most of those games didnt already imitate other games themselves
[1:50:19] DaveGrecoArt: as an omni crafter in ffxiv.. all you do in ffxiv is spam 1 macro to max.. not quite the same lol
[1:50:24] zorantt: @Towelliee Do you know estimate shipping costs to Canada?

[1:50:32] scenario17: can we xfaction race?
[1:50:36] dewking93: all those poweder supplements are the same
[1:50:46] Jey1h: @Stopnsmellmynutz the only thing is differnt qualities of ores etc. Alot of mmo crafting systems have that, so not from ff14 per say.   Im saying this as someone who has all the crafts maxed out in ff14
[1:50:55] Ekazz: @zorantt It's not that much, you better buy 2 buckets tho
[1:50:59] bobbyg24k: Fast & Furious Dragon Flight

[1:52:31] slimoby: too bad
[1:52:31] Jey1h: @DaveGrecoArt Yeah you kind of bypass the whole crafting system with just doing macro's. Made the crafting just as boring as wow crafting, just each craft takes alot longer xD
[1:52:34] Mattysaiyan: Frankly it's a skill issue
[1:52:36] BoezIRL: then you loose
[1:52:37] Crushn_u: git gud then

[1:52:51] TacDuc: Hah, boomer blast, sounds amazing
[1:52:57] Ekazz: 15mg of CBD per serving (scoop)
[1:52:58] zorantt: @stallowned They do but damn. Those shipping costs. $19 to Richmond, BC
[1:53:17] Ekazz: I'll get timeout lol
[1:53:18] theSalute: is their shipping less expensive to canada than gfuel? gfuel the shipping is almost as much as the product
[1:53:19] BearOfLight: do you have to be a boomer to drink it? or does it turn you into a boomer?
[1:53:21] DaveGrecoArt: @Jey1h totally. its literally just spamming macros based on cp and repeat

[1:57:29] Kisswani: wait , PvP race ? POGGERS
[1:57:41] dyslexican1: My biggest issue with G-fuel is it makes me feel dehydrated. or more so then some others.
[1:57:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: The bubbles slow you down!!

[2:03:31] its_Xek: does chill have any caffeine
[2:03:35] Sollice: @DiiscoViking You have laws and regulations you have to follow for opening a business. And your selling a controlled product like alcohol and cigs. It's not going to be easy

[2:10:59] biirrd: Arcane by a long shot
[2:10:59] danathar_: frost aoe is incorrect

[2:12:28] Adventw0lf: @Towelliee bro they need to give Arcane that Torghast power that turns people into chairs
[2:12:30] wastedxtime93: I want to like fire mage, but the rotation is the most boring imo for a caster.
[2:12:30] TheZofren: Do you ever worry that playing so much alpha will take away from your launch experience?
[2:12:31] dyslexican1: look he has 5 abilities on his bars. must be done setting up his arcane mage. :)

[2:16:12] ayrisen: "Speeds up the harvest and teleports me off this rock"
[2:16:14] EKS90_: @chulklol might be different in DF, we don't know yet.

[2:16:34] awesomeness_inc: @Towelliee u use it before u take dmg, then use it again to reverse the dmg
[2:16:38] cookie_jayy: Yes
[2:16:39] ghost186_: yep
[2:16:41] TacDuc: And you regain health
[2:16:43] Kasvot_Vaxt: yes you can still die with it though
[2:16:49] raye_gaming22: its a cd you use on heavy dmg
[2:16:53] PunkFunction: whatever your health was snapshotted at
[2:16:55] Neztrous: @Towelliee  you wanna use it before you think you are abotu to receive big damage, it "saves" your health and location and brings you right back to it, you can press again or you can wait til it runs out and does it on its own
[2:16:56] raye_gaming22: to reset hp
[2:16:56] awesomeness_inc: @Towelliee exactly
[2:16:57] KoBurK: Get some procs and then use it to have those procs back again
[2:16:58] dalaraz: its a snapshot more or less @Towelliee
[2:17:01] PunkFunction: you can also unheal yourself i believe
[2:17:11] raye_gaming22: yes
[2:17:12] br3z: its personal
[2:17:13] cookie_jayy: No that would be BADASS
[2:17:13] raye_gaming22: you can
[2:17:15] ghost186_: Its only for you
[2:17:16] mavericks312: yes
[2:17:17] Kasvot_Vaxt: personal
[2:17:23] SlippieSlik: Only counts for you
[2:17:26] spiked16: yes
[2:17:26] Neztrous: yes
[2:17:31] cookie_jayy: oh only for oyu whole raid would be cool tho
[2:17:43] Karnivor___: mage have combo points?
[2:17:45] dalaraz: it snapshots you when you press it then returns you to the snapshot @Towelliee
[2:17:45] mavericks312: its mostly used with icy veins so you can technically get 2 charges of icy veins
[2:17:52] Neztrous: yup
[2:17:52] ghost186_: once it expiers you go back
[2:17:55] Ali_J1: you can cancel it
[2:17:57] Sluggs_: after 10 seconds it will auto activate
[2:18:02] Machine42593: you can right click it off?
[2:18:03] Machine42593: maybe
[2:18:05] MBG_95: you can cancel aura it
[2:18:06] bangorangg: @mavericks312 it doesnt tie to buffs my g
[2:18:07] temp3st98: @PrimeNr23 only arcane
[2:18:19] BigJustin26: ya alter time isn't as cool as you'd like it to be, i wish it returned used mana as well
[2:18:22] raye_gaming22: and oyu egt on the position you sued on youcan doge mechanics in raid with this too like the painsmith spikes
[2:18:27] Kasvot_Vaxt: you need arcane echo i think
[2:18:33] thegrt13: 5th row on the left
[2:19:21] Neruan: rule of threes DansGame
[2:19:31] ghost186_: Touch of magi is super amazing in DF
[2:19:33] BigJustin26: ya arcane spends a loooot of anima, it's usually per every 5 mana used
[2:19:35] the_pyke: NO
[2:19:36] shanknbank: nah, use more mana
[2:19:36] Shaalil: u spend alot of mana when u get stacks
[2:19:39] br3z: the more mana you spend gives you more chance for clear casting
[2:19:42] the_pyke: not higher
[2:19:44] PunkFunction: no you use 345 mana A LOT
[2:19:57] BigJustin26: ya Shadowlands has ruined me me @Towelliee xD
[2:20:27] Respls: wow
[2:20:36] chulklol: this hit hard
[2:20:38] BigJustin26: ya that's new

[2:20:43] Neztrous: bug taker
[2:20:45] chulklol: waaaaay up :D
[2:20:46] Neztrous: big
[2:20:46] Kasvot_Vaxt: yeah
[2:20:47] thegrt13: it's the new arcane power
[2:20:50] maskedboy999: take It now Kreygasm
[2:20:51] Respls: yeah take that
[2:20:52] ghost186_: Its amazeing
[2:20:52] raye_gaming22: its you cd
[2:20:57] xReadyAimMissx: side hammer maybe? LUL
[2:21:06] maskedboy999: Unlimited power
[2:21:15] CozzyFlannel: im-puh-tes
[2:21:18] Crushn_u: explosion is great for dungeons
[2:21:22] awkswow: penis on the brain
[2:21:23] Neztrous: explosion and impetus
[2:21:25] Neztrous: for sure
[2:21:29] Corruptwarrior: @CozzyFlannel thank you
[2:21:40] br3z: play orbs and harmony
[2:21:42] ghost186_: Impetus and missle
[2:21:51] Kasvot_Vaxt: familiar trash
[2:21:53] BigJustin26: good, extra charges to get all your charges to get max damage from arcane blast quicker
[2:21:57] chulklol: u need the bottem right and mid path at the end
[2:22:12] ghost186_: yes
[2:22:47] ghost186_: so they dont have to think about talents
[2:22:47] Kasvot_Vaxt: you use barrage to get mana back in conserve phase
[2:23:03] flebbooo: they basically took most of the rank ups u get during lvling and through them in the tree instead
[2:23:11] TacDuc: Especially for DK, it feels so painful
[2:23:18] Shalestorm: 4 talents, which in nature also forces tree pathing
[2:23:22] temp3st98: yeah it's so stupid
[2:23:22] bloowaterr: Yeah but lives talent system is the cause of that
[2:23:24] BigJustin26: ya arcane blast does a lot of damage and blows through mana really quick at max arcane charges but clearcasting arcane missile procs are where your biggest single target damage comes from. lots of procs is big big deeps
[2:23:26] Mordredlol: yep and now they wont have time to fix it cuz of a december release date lol
[2:23:28] Shalestorm: to maintain what you already have
[2:23:30] br3z: or 2% crit
[2:23:34] temp3st98: so wasted talent spots :/
[2:23:34] ghost186_: They took all the conduts and skills and made them talents
[2:23:35] Teknofear64: too many buttons is terrible!
[2:23:37] Demanisraar: sounds lame
[2:23:38] br3z: real gud design
[2:23:41] Kisswani: I think we're thinking about trees solely from endgame player perspective . if you are leveling , reaching this talent while leveling up would feel cool @Towelliee
[2:23:45] OGXanos: I'd rather have less talents than have current abilities split up
[2:23:49] PunkFunction: the upside is that it makes learning what your skills do while leveling easier
[2:23:49] educatedbird13: seems like they are just trying to artificially pad the # of talents they created
[2:23:56] bloowaterr: Yeah but thats exactly the trade off lol
[2:24:15] Neruan: they dont splitt the buttons tho they just take the ranked spells aways from the baseline version jsut like it is now on liv
[2:24:26] thegrt13: yea. icy veins is a big offender for that
[2:24:29] awesomeness_inc: @Towelliee yes but the idea is, that u can have what you have now, or u can do something else, u won't actually gain more
[2:24:33] soysos91: this is why the talent "squish" happened in the first place I believe, we're "taking" talents that's pretty much a class staple
[2:24:39] Robodope: they should get rid of all these filler nodes and just give us choice nodes. maybe 3 choices per node.
[2:24:40] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100631756-15027263 towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[2:24:40] bloowaterr: every 15 leveles get a single talent that does everything but evretyone plays the exact same thing . Or make atalent system like this where very player is close in playstyle but unique
[2:24:46] BigJustin26: ok so when you use an arcane barrage and use up your arcane charges you gain bonus haste. that's great
[2:25:14] Ensanee: !alpha
[2:25:14] Moobot: @Ensanee ALPHA PHASE 4 - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. Beta in a month?
[2:26:10] awesomeness_inc: @Towelliee u prolly don't need the arcane barrage cleave unless u do mythic+
[2:26:10] neo_0098: no New Alpha build today?
[2:26:41] Kasvot_Vaxt: evocation while moving? nice
[2:26:43] Shalestorm: Yoooo
[2:26:47] mashiesmashie: Is there defo an Alpha build cos you said you didn't get an email this week?
[2:26:47] Shalestorm: nice
[2:26:49] BigJustin26: evocation to be cast while moving is great
[2:26:54] ghost186_: UGE
[2:26:56] chulklol: ya
[2:26:57] Kisswani: wait that's great
[2:26:59] Meakis: MAGE CONTENT
[2:27:00] Meakis: WOOOOO
[2:27:02] BigJustin26: and ya touch of the magi is arcane living bomb
[2:27:09] chulklol: its op
[2:27:12] Meakis: Touch of the Magi is part of the burst
[2:27:16] Kasvot_Vaxt: ya thats new
[2:27:18] Neruan: without toch you are usless
[2:27:21] dyslexican1: I kinda wish they had done most of the tallents in the form of the way they are now, mixed in with ones that include them, and later in the tree, we got talents that are more balanced forms of old azurite powers, and teir set bonuses and stuff to let us pick and buff our selves in different ways. Not split up current talents into 3-4 parts.
[2:27:24] JBotTheBot: why does this look like they took some of your level up spells and just stuck them in the tree
[2:27:27] Meakis: Clearcasting is great
[2:27:30] chulklol: improved barrage ?
[2:27:32] maskedboy999: amplification for sure
[2:27:34] tuckz: !alpha
[2:27:34] Moobot: @tuckz ALPHA PHASE 4 - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. Beta in a month?
[2:27:35] pompey72: towLewd
[2:27:44] maskedboy999: amplification
[2:27:45] BigJustin26: for pure single target, clearcasting procs for arcane missiles is your biggest damage dealer imo
[2:27:56] joey9212: @Towelliee  hey man, great content!
[2:28:11] Taaliaaaa: its an aoe spell
[2:28:13] Crushn_u: why not start at bottom and decide which way you wanna go first
[2:28:16] Neruan: its a dot
[2:28:28] Taaliaaaa: aoe dot
[2:28:28] ghost186_: Living bomb
[2:28:35] noobtesting: noobtesting subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[2:28:48] Neruan: supernova still suless FeelsBadMan
[2:28:54] Meakis: Supernova is usefull while leveling and in AOE situation but single target far less
[2:29:02] holtrop: I hope they fix some of the mage talents today
[2:29:26] BigJustin26: oh ya
[2:29:46] Meakis: Arcane surge is THE BURST
[2:30:03] jimmwayne: when server up ?
[2:30:04] BigJustin26: grab all the arcane missiles / clearcasting stuff
[2:30:10] Teknofear64: Use supernova on a tank
[2:30:19] Teknofear64: after they group up many enemies

[2:30:22] Meakis: Clearcasting can proc of any mana use
[2:30:25] BigJustin26: you spent mana and got lucky lol
[2:30:27] Zorthul_: TA
[2:30:28] megalomanisk2: Your Time Anomaly talent
[2:30:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: are servers up yet?
[2:30:32] Kasvot_Vaxt: any mana use
[2:30:36] Brumbs: When the heck is warlock talents coming out yo?
[2:30:38] BigJustin26: ohhh
[2:30:40] Kasvot_Vaxt: ooo
[2:30:45] Meakis: Ah time anomaly yeh
[2:30:55] h116_: you get the dmg buff
[2:30:57] roodenburgertje: @Brumbs probably as last
[2:31:02] thegrt13: I think it's just the damage buff yea
[2:31:02] chulklol: ya
[2:31:12] Neruan: wait the manaregen procc is insane wtf
[2:31:14] Brumbs: @roodenburgertje feels bad
[2:31:15] Meakis: Clearcasting procs quite a few
[2:31:18] Meakis: YES
[2:31:19] BigJustin26: maybe this afternoon when the alpha goes down for the new build @Brumbs fingers crossed
[2:31:21] Meakis: MANA GEM YEEEES
[2:31:27] chulklol: nope
[2:31:27] maskedboy999: na
[2:31:29] xReadyAimMissx: @droopydorf honestly wow can play on so many machines, it's pretty easy having a pc that can run it. you pretty much would just want to make sure the laptop has it's own dedicated graphics card from amd or nvidia. don't need a high end machine for this game.
[2:31:29] ghost186_: Mana gem is shit
[2:31:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: mana gem is more of a raid thing
[2:31:40] Neruan: you never press mangem
[2:31:40] roodenburgertje: @Brumbs yeah :-(
[2:31:41] Kriven: mana gem is garbo
[2:31:50] Daarksyde: mana gem is 3sec cast tho...
[2:32:04] drbigbanger: Evocation is so much better then mana gem. It doesnt make sense why mana gem is even there
[2:32:06] Meakis: @Daark11 It creates a mana gem to use it ?
[2:32:06] bashinhead: go for harmony last right tree and take harmony but dont go beyond that and get arcane orb
[2:32:13] Meakis: Later on
[2:32:15] bashinhead: some stuff are more aoe than single target
[2:32:18] Moudi: wonder if mana gem spelldmg is counted as a potion tho, it shouldnt
[2:32:19] jimmwayne: you read fragnace tweet
[2:32:21] dranet11: OMEGALUL
[2:32:22] Meakis: wtf evo is there ?
[2:32:22] flebbooo: noope KEKW
[2:32:23] xReadyAimMissx: @droopydorf oh and make sure it uses a ssd and not hdd. so everything loads faster.
[2:32:25] luckfore: KEKW
[2:32:27] Neruan: dont realy need it anyway
[2:32:31] saevenar: you don't need it though
[2:32:33] luckfore: youre a shit wizard towel
[2:32:33] nilachip: so what's the most fun to play mage spec in alpha ?
[2:32:35] TheeLazyDuck: anyone know what affixes we get on S4?
[2:32:37] Kriven: yup welcome to the shit arcane tree
[2:32:38] Teknofear64: backtrack time
[2:32:39] Brumbs: Mana gem…. Makes my peepee cry
[2:32:39] zmashie: hello! is dragonflight on PTR or is still with invite?
[2:32:41] Velot_: No Evo as Arcane?
[2:32:44] Dinermoe: hes not qutting wow
[2:33:03] MARTZiiE: hes movin so hes not raidin with Echo for S4
[2:33:07] Thoreya: he gone for s4
[2:33:10] MARTZiiE: new team for DF sounds like
[2:33:26] Sollice: Enjoyed his DH streams
[2:33:31] blooodraine: Rofl a OG thats need to retrial... dah fuck
[2:33:32] BoezIRL: @zmashie still alpha
[2:33:46] ZetYokai: he picked a bad time to move to the UK
[2:33:48] Thoreya: crazy theyre making him retrial again lol
[2:33:48] pavepawns: @Towelliee you want an arcane build? that well versed in aoe and single target?
[2:33:53] itsDets: true
[2:33:54] DeanoTV: yep ez
[2:33:55] Gennzo: easy
[2:33:55] Nokram: for sure
[2:33:56] zmashie: @zmashie ah so sad :( thanks for the info!
[2:33:56] Demanisraar: yup
[2:33:58] arcaniia007: agree
[2:34:00] Thoreya: definitely
[2:34:01] flebbooo: 100%, dude is a big pumper
[2:34:02] Dinermoe: one of the best multiclass players we'll ever see
[2:34:02] mashiesmashie: Also, since we left the EU, getting into the UK is a nightmare
[2:34:03] brewgamingtv: yes
[2:34:03] MARTZiiE: facts
[2:34:04] Taaliaaaa: yeah hes pretty up there
[2:34:07] flebbooo: yh him and Trill
[2:34:08] biirrd: Easy top 1
[2:34:13] Kedor2k: He has pumped since cata
[2:34:14] Thoreya: frag is best multiclasser in the world
[2:34:14] DecayedmiNt: Yup, one of the best multiclassers
[2:34:16] Tarnaz_: meeres and frag are both god gamers
[2:34:16] MARTZiiE: frag trill are swiss army knives
[2:34:17] SLoPPYALieN: easily
[2:34:20] Daarksyde: Frag always lazer focused in raid
[2:34:27] jones9: Frag, Trill, Atrocity all insane players but Jimmy just hit different
[2:34:32] blooodraine: Frag is awesome nice and always trys to answer everything... Dont understand that a OG needs to retrial.... Dah fck
[2:34:34] Thoreya: they must think hes replaceable
[2:34:37] tdizziie: imagine asking a player that good to retrial lol
[2:34:46] jones9: That retrial is BS and a slap in the face
[2:34:52] dranet11: it's more about the effort he put in rather than how he plays
[2:34:52] nilachip: agree, bad Echo decision
[2:35:01] Saekenz: why would he need to retrial if he player with these guys for so many years lol
[2:35:01] Vilkanog: You talk about fragnance or fraggo? They’re 2 different person
[2:35:03] itsDets: KEKW
[2:35:03] Thoreya: they said last tier he had bad effort
[2:35:04] Luxicake: maybe its just a "equal opportunity" type of thing.. nobody gets special treatment type thing?
[2:35:05] brewgamingtv: yeah that's crazy to ask him to retrial lol
[2:35:05] facerolljack: probably the best multiclasser that exists out there being asked to retrial for meme season KEKW
[2:35:11] raye_gaming22: i hope jimmy joins method and slaps echo
[2:35:15] Thoreya: his problem was effort
[2:35:16] CasuallyEfficient: Usual WoW shit 😂
[2:35:18] magemaster225: you dont think the bucs scouted tom brady
[2:35:21] flebbooo: yh when i heard that i was confused KEKW
[2:35:23] Dankind64: Yeah super bad move. Like making Tom Brady tryout
[2:35:27] bloowaterr: I think that was him being humble
[2:35:29] blooodraine: @Towelliee Frag is awesome nice and always trys to answer everything... Dont understand that a OG needs to retrial.... Dah fck....
[2:35:30] vonbechtle: someone elses gain in the end
[2:35:30] CGd0c: roger and scripe are just cringe characters
[2:35:30] bloowaterr: they didnt ask him
[2:35:31] Sluggs_: gotta ask lebron to try out for the next team he goes to
[2:35:33] zenniik: Echo is clearly mad about him not being able to raid
[2:35:35] evillocks: its probably a org guideline,  so top players cant just take off when they want
[2:35:59] luckfore: id join method if i were him LUL
[2:35:59] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[2:36:00] BigJustin26: i'm surprised Evocate is that far down the arcane tree... it's like a required ability to even use this spec
[2:36:05] Xynth25: He was a retrial for Sepulcher and failed.
[2:36:06] Luxicake: KEKW
[2:36:08] itsDets: LUL
[2:36:11] stallowned: LUL
[2:36:16] Tripl3dot: LUL
[2:36:16] chulklol: lol
[2:36:17] mavericks312: liquid would never ask trill to retrial lol
[2:36:18] ZetYokai: he should play for liquid lmao
[2:36:26] Thoreya: method got 6 pieces raiders
[2:36:27] Thoreya: they goiong hard
[2:36:28] zenniik: @Towelliee Echo is clearly mad about him not being able to raid
[2:36:29] Zippaya: true
[2:36:31] BigJustin26: i'm surprised Evocate is that far down the arcane tree... it's like a required ability to even use this spec...
[2:36:32] Dinermoe: i mean if Avade isnt playing for Liquid they gonna need a DH player
[2:36:38] RowanWeir: @BigJustin26 not so much anymore, the big cd gives mana regen anyway, and theres the arcane barrage restore for general conserve phase
[2:36:52] MARTZiiE: frag to method >
[2:36:58] xReadyAimMissx: It's super weird when these gaming teams basically punish people for needing to put their personal lives first for a short time. I'd love to see a professional sports team do that to the best player in the league. LUL
[2:37:01] raye_gaming22: @Dinermoe hewill play again if  the Dh trees are good
[2:37:05] MARTZiiE: method came all the way back
[2:37:05] DecayedmiNt: It was pieces quitting for me and Method
[2:37:17] luckfore: method will get world 1st with the power of blockchain next tier
[2:37:20] garmin1987: kyrian
[2:37:21] MARTZiiE: alot of people though they were finished after all the drama in BFA
[2:37:22] BigJustin26: kyrian ability
[2:37:24] h116_: ye kyrian
[2:37:25] flebbooo: Kyrian
[2:37:25] Neruan: kyrian
[2:37:26] Byytet: kyrian yes
[2:37:27] Dinermoe: @Dinermoe i know. but chances are they gonna suck major balls
[2:37:30] NickyNiclas: I don't think anyone should have special privileges. Anyone can become washed up due to circumstances, the show must go on.
[2:37:37] arcaniia007: but he also says : , I´ll still be streaming and I´ll be back to chasing RWF in DF - Hope see yall then , so that means he will come back for Dragonflight to Echo
[2:37:38] Thoreya: @xReadyAimMissx he was demoted after the tier becuase of his effort
[2:38:00] jimmwayne: when server s up?
[2:38:02] Daarksyde: take 2 points out of the arcane explosion right below the clearclasting node
[2:38:04] Wolfenhoof: @NiclaZ If some people wouldn't have special privileges, fucking Scripe would still be banned for RMT^^
[2:38:06] Dinermoe: @arcaniia007 doenst mean he will play for Echo
[2:38:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Orb stuff is good
[2:38:35] Dinermoe: @NiclaZ dude all of the RWF guilds would be banned. what is your argument
[2:38:54] LeDerpski: Harmony/Kyrian is current build on live
[2:38:57] NickyNiclas: Yeah Limit did a lot of RMT too back then
[2:39:13] Dinermoe: pretty sure all of the big names were involved in RMT
[2:39:21] Crushn_u: you are gonna want evoc
[2:39:24] gregoryvamosi: arcane familiar is pretty nice too at the top left
[2:39:26] zuna1904: and they got banned :D
[2:39:38] Demanisraar: Best music rn
[2:39:43] mmrghost7: i wanna see DH talent tree today HOPIUM
[2:39:51] Diviond: were more class trees released today?
[2:39:52] Xynth25: He wasn't retrialing Season 4, he failed a retrial in Sepulcher.
[2:39:55] Literae: the problem I feel with everyone's response to the talents is that people are spending too many points trying to mimic "current" spec and not being able to get the new things. build the spec how you want and you can, stop trying to be Shadowlands + "cool things". one rogue build can have 3 cov abilities, but won't play like retail Kappa it's how you build it
[2:40:03] MARTZiiE: is this the zone music ????
[2:40:08] Thoreya: ya he got demoted in sepulcher
[2:40:16] MysticRaven_: @Martziie nah
[2:40:19] Demanisraar: @Martziie it's grizzly hills music
[2:40:22] Dinermoe: @Martziie no music in Alpha AFAIK
[2:40:30] beezly33: beezly33 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:40:30] beezly33: beezly33 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:40:33] looney199725: i mean gingi said if people are underpreforming sometims they get demoted
[2:40:47] LeDerpski: Spark - Magi - CDs

[2:59:13] Sollice: Couple of hours when NA servers come up
[2:59:14] Wolfenhoof: @Cliffhoof Last thing people will hear is a silent mooo out of the dark before the sap of a hoof will burst their head. May the earthmother guide us in the shadows.
[2:59:16] maalow: We knew that Deepshades didn't play SL except for WF, times change
[2:59:17] unc0de: @mashiesmashie I was gonna say, eventually wow becomes less of a priority, even when you can play it at a higher level.
[2:59:19] BrandonB21: once they hit 27 there past there prime
[2:59:23] Respls: yeah totally ageism
[2:59:28] Kisswani: who knows , this could be the catalyst for new orgs to try for RWF ?
[2:59:31] KingKelTV: Prime days are over, time to start WoW retirement

[3:00:11] Kisswani: @Xetter well , there's a good reason for that
[3:00:14] TophurPlays: If there are no delays which is *highly* unlikely the servers will be up in 2 hours for NA
[3:00:20] apb89: just realized its a tauren mage
[3:00:22] Dystilled: @Xetter funny that
[3:00:23] JediNeo99999: @StreamCrush highest ever

[3:00:39] Fr4nkyb0y: is this a new build ?
[3:00:41] GriffGoodman: cow > highmountain cow?
[3:00:43] Wolfenhoof: i think there is a spanish one "Clan de los Tauren", or something like that
[3:00:43] Sollice: no
[3:00:53] arashanti: did you take arcane orb?
[3:00:56] moa285: Is there already a new alpha build or are we still waiting?

[3:01:07] looney199725: will be interestiing to see if anyone else goes before 10.0
[3:01:16] Xellana287: @Towelliee If Blizz isn't tuning for World First anymore, I expect the Race to be over within 24h in DF. Think so too?
[3:01:19] OwenHalliday: Are those the new actionbars? They're pretty nice!
[3:01:39] fokeriser: who cares about rwf andies anyways just make a good game and the rest can go to shit EZ

[3:02:41] elyviontv: @Towelliee when does the new season come out?
[3:02:43] fokeriser: arcane not having any mana issue feels super weird

[3:02:48] maskedboy999: @thagoris refill with water
[3:02:51] amojabi: Juan soto and Josh Bell to the Padres

[3:03:49] Kasvot_Vaxt: no only AB
[3:03:54] fokeriser: missles shouldn't

[3:03:59] Neruan: missile damge always same
[3:04:00] Kasvot_Vaxt: blast
[3:04:12] BigJustin26: no, arcane missile damage isn't dependent on your charges
[3:04:14] whyabadi: Ele blast will probably reach 100k too
[3:04:19] lucid_wow: @OwenHalliday yeah its the new cooldown it spends all your mana to do insane damage then increases your mana regen by a bunch for a bit
[3:04:22] business_man_alex: why do the bosses look a bit boring so far?
[3:04:28] Thoreya: juan soto to the padres @Towelliee
[3:04:32] fokeriser: dumb op evoker gachiGASM gonna get nerfed before i get into beta FeelsBadMan
[3:04:36] ambiotic: Wow is always the best when arcane is the top mage spec
[3:04:47] OwenHalliday: @OwenHalliday Ahh, that's a pretty unique spell, and kinda fits the arcane vibe glad to see they're keeping the RPG aspect
[3:04:57] Neruan: its such a shame that supernova is still only a aoe stop the damae is puitifull
[3:04:59] Thoreya: yup
[3:05:00] BrandonB21: @ambiotic frost :P
[3:05:02] Merzerker: yupp
[3:05:07] Holysal: yep
[3:05:07] pavepawns: @fokeriser i mean it would be better u get the nerfed and not the op version so u end up hating the dmg loss
[3:05:10] Kisswani: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1554494250280263682
[3:05:12] lucid_wow: yeah i think that spell is really interesting especially with the touch of the magi window, could be an incredibly fun gameplay loop
[3:05:16] Fruity_Pebbles2018: good dodgers dint get him
[3:05:21] Dram4Llama: Juan Soto AND Josh Bell
[3:05:21] Malarick: yup just saw that

[3:06:03] BigJustin26: wow a pull from 1999
[3:06:04] Dram4Llama: 1998 was the padres got swept
[3:06:09] Malarick: or was that '98?
[3:06:15] Malarick: the Padres
[3:06:15] Kneo: Mariners fan here!
[3:06:17] Holysal: they got josh bell too LUL
[3:06:26] Thagoris: Best thing Pirate's fans have going for them, is by August they can swap to watching Steelers Football
[3:06:34] Vonsterr: youre playing MAGEEE?
[3:06:35] happyheals: Go Rays!
[3:06:37] Vonsterr: i thought id never see this
[3:06:40] BigJustin26: there's people in the chat who weren't even alive in 98 i'm sure lol
[3:06:41] dormeau_1992: As an person from the eu. I just dont get the whole hype about baseball and football
[3:06:48] xReadyAimMissx: @Thagoris oof LUL
[3:06:50] arashanti: Pirates are an MLB farm team
[3:06:55] llNoTToXiCll: feelsbadman sports is whack
[3:07:05] lucid_wow: @BigJustin26 whole 6 years after for me LUL
[3:07:11] Sollice: @dormeau_1992 Because your main sport is soccer. A lot of people in the US would probably say they dont get the hype with soccer
[3:07:13] common_taco: pirates fan, they are great for background noise
[3:07:13] llNoTToXiCll: Arcane explosion needs some buff
[3:07:16] pigzip: 99 was Yankees Atlanta
[3:07:16] Elseworldz: @dormeau_1992 I'm FROM the U.S. and I don't get it either. I don't understand the hype around sports.
[3:07:19] looney199725: s4 got delayed till 11 am
[3:07:19] jaalexba: Why is it tauren only?
[3:07:28] QuesoFM: talent i think
[3:07:29] h116_: visual bug
[3:07:32] dormeau_1992: @Sollice thats true :)
[3:07:40] dormeau_1992: @Elseworldz haha :P
[3:07:47] Malarick: Padres was 98
[3:07:55] Malarick: Braves 96 and 99
[3:08:00] lucid_wow: yeah i saw a similar bug for combo points
[3:08:05] Malarick: Mets 2000
[3:08:05] SauceFu: Trade isn't official yet. Hossmer has to approve the trade since he is involved. WSH was on his no trade list. They believe he will but hasn't yet
[3:08:14] Elseworldz: I watch sports and it's like ResidentSleeper for me.
[3:08:22] Sleyenda_UK: can you still move while clealcasting?
[3:08:33] TacDuc: As a person from EU, I don't give a fuck about how others are doing at sports
[3:08:34] Sleyenda_UK: clearcasting*
[3:08:36] Molvonos: Oof
[3:08:38] flebbooo: EZ
[3:08:44] kenagon55: LUL
[3:08:59] Demanisraar: That Evoker thing, is it any fun to play? I don't mean damage wise because they will be op as heck, but just rotation/abilities?
[3:09:15] ChillinMoose: Soto and Bell to Padres ?
[3:09:46] BigJustin26: "mage what are you doing? the death beam is coming right at you!?" mage be like lol blink
[3:09:56] lucid_wow: this boss looks pretty cool
[3:10:06] rfmoore1965: I just arrived.  Is that a Tauren mage?

[3:10:42] Kasvot_Vaxt: ive always found frost to be kind of boring
[3:10:49] UltraKSlaya: that's why I like fire and arcane a bit more than frost
[3:10:50] happyspot: not a fun 2 years a nats and cubs fan lol
[3:10:58] Meakis: thta has been my main complaint most. Frost always feels like a wet noodle ( not damage wise, but feeling ) and fire and arcane always felt more force
[3:11:14] Elseworldz: I tried playing fire, but I just don't GET it anymore. I miss when it was simpler.
[3:11:20] PunkFunction: i miss my fire balls
[3:11:35] lucid_wow: i feel like fire is one of the most fun specs in the game for like 15 seconds or whatever every 2 mins and then one of the more boring for the rest of the time, imo anyway
[3:11:46] amojabi: legion fire mage and spriest were top tier fun specs

[3:12:04] Bubisaur: how long until servers are up?
[3:12:04] Toon_irl: probably worth getting it graded tbh
[3:12:17] looney199725: i wanna see raid testing cmon blizzzzz

[3:13:22] Thagoris: Which M+ dungeon are you looking forward to the most?
[3:13:40] llNoTToXiCll: Arcane explosion seems so weak

[3:14:21] Mossburg: holy shit what?! daaaaaamn lol

[3:14:30] Mossburg: seen you took Reds too thats my team
[3:14:32] lucid_wow: is there an mlb reggie jackson too? i dont follow baseball so i was confused hearing a familiar name there lol
[3:14:34] ghost186_: What Royals baseballs?
[3:14:44] Respls: Royal are my home town team
[3:14:50] visaeris412: losing their 2023 first rounder, stephen ross suspended for a few months

[3:16:12] aztech88: Balls.
[3:16:15] derekm5218: @Towelliee do you have high hopes for our colts this year?
[3:16:28] Tac2cul2: did they mention what Faded raid will be today?or is that not known yet
[3:16:32] ghost186_: How much did all that cost?
[3:16:40] fokeriser: CN
[3:16:48] ThaYetii: @Tac2cul2 Castle Nath
[3:16:55] Tac2cul2: thnx @ chat
[3:17:11] ghost186_: Damn thats not as much I was assumeing for three singed balls and shit
[3:17:18] lucid_wow: looks like a lot of smaller trash pulls this dungeon tho obviously depends on tuning but maybe outlaw target cap wont really matter at least in this one Pog
[3:17:48] rbgdev: I can’t wait to get the fated mount s4

[3:18:53] Syrc0: Qucik question about S4. Does anyone know if All Bosses in each raid are fated and active or just a few of the bosses?
[3:18:53] rbgdev: This guys trash talking me I don’t even fucking know him
[3:18:56] Dystilled: So much salt on the forums about that

[3:19:08] TAYLOR_HAM: Normal supposed to be like LFR so getting it should not be that bad
[3:19:25] rbgdev: Ty
[3:19:27] DiiscoViking: logs??
[3:19:27] visaeris412: if they get soto the padres will have 6 players making at least $15M next year, better win something
[3:19:31] Meakis: TBH
[3:19:34] rbgdev: I’m just trying to be excited about a mount
[3:19:36] Milanesa_De_Pollo: joining and making groups is way harder than the raid itself
[3:19:38] temp3st98: lazy mofos KEKW
[3:19:38] Shaaz09: @Syrc0 one one raid per week will be fated. This week is Nathria
[3:19:39] wyrokk: true
[3:19:44] Dystilled: The trash talking in LFR is bad enough, people don't want to put themselves through a "proper" pug
[3:19:50] skewlbeta: when your queue pops it takes 5 pulls on each boss because people don't know what they are doing lol
[3:19:52] Kale_Nd: The issue is that people ask for achiev even for normal
[3:19:55] Meakis: Dungeon finder i'm fine with, it's just the teleport to dungeon i'm not

[3:20:49] LeDerpski: I think people have just put more time into evoker than any other spec since its new
[3:20:52] lucid_wow: @DiiscoViking oh yeah no flame i just want to see spriest be really good lol

[3:21:32] DiiscoViking: @lucid_wow I think its better than it used to be, but still needs improvment
[3:21:38] Shaaz09: @Syrc0 All of the bosses in the raid will have one extra thing to deal with.
[3:21:42] itsrambo: S4 in 1 hour 45 mins

[3:22:01] Axestazy: will this expansion be legion level?
[3:22:16] lucid_wow: @DiiscoViking thats good to hear atleast, im not in alpha nor am i a spriest main so im not 100% in the loop but id love to play it as an alt going into DF bc its very fun
[3:22:20] the_general01: @fokeriser there havent been any delays yet. we're still on time
[3:22:22] Molvonos: Lots of stuff got nerfed heroic
[3:22:25] Rinarii_x: @axestazy I’m hoping for wrath level tbh

[3:22:52] dantezalive: is the saber mount goinng to be removed after SL or is it like a glory achieve
[3:22:53] Axestazy: @rinarii_x im not that optimistic
[3:22:53] gelimarr: what is season 4 actually? just restarting the raids again? I'm so lost
[3:23:00] DiiscoViking: @lucid_wow I am normally a disc main so spriest is a bit different. survivabilty is much better, and offheals
[3:23:03] Molvonos: LFR Heros REEEE.  towSip
[3:23:05] Nillraac: That sounds reasonable to me
[3:23:07] amojabi: Towelliee what is the min il youre wanting for the viewer raid?

[3:24:55] dimofodi: Every expansion should end with a season where they nerf all the raids and give you silly stupid Torghast powers and let you go smash it all around for a month or two.

[3:27:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: And slime cat!
[3:27:13] kokochris: I thinking of just spending the time doing alts to 60 for fun
[3:27:30] KoreKode: @Towelliee Im having a huge issue deciding if I want to main Warrior or paladin. I really like both. Any suggestions if I only have time to focus on 1 of them at the moment.
[3:27:36] Dankind64: it's like a fun victory lap
[3:27:40] BlueBeast33: Hopefully they extend the exp buff
[3:27:53] Adventw0lf: @Towelliee Lemme smash. I'm a get that bitch a stick. Bitches love sticks.
[3:27:57] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Are servers up yet?
[3:28:03] Tharia: yes!
[3:28:03] Akuka_: Yu[
[3:28:09] Intikamcy: yessssssss
[3:28:10] KingKelTV: Hard agree
[3:28:10] taintalizerx: yep
[3:28:11] nihilistic_bat: oh yes
[3:28:11] kokochris: true true
[3:28:12] 311623channel: yeah.
[3:28:12] Tharia: agreed
[3:28:13] tastytictacs: even as someone who raids, i really want that exp buff till DF
[3:28:14] Kakotan2143: YES!! I agree @Towelliee
[3:28:16] Kelwinnz: Agree
[3:28:16] nihilistic_bat: that makes no sense
[3:28:18] seedwolfmgo: faacts
[3:28:23] Its_an_implication: Yup. Everyone wants a bunch of characters at 60.
[3:28:24] XshadowturkeyX: i mean how long dose it take to lvl?
[3:28:26] Dystilled: The XP buff was WAY too short. I was going to level toons but I had uni assessments so missed it entirely
[3:28:26] kokochris: they always could if they get the feedback
[3:28:29] Terminator_Puppy: didn't they have a similar buff end of season 1?
[3:28:29] nihilistic_bat: why would they even take it away, leave it at 50%
[3:28:31] dantezalive: they want ppl to buy the heroic bundle for the 60 boost
[3:28:34] LordScrooblord: yeah I don't get why when the same outcry happened at the end of BfA when they took winds of wisdom away
[3:28:34] tonyr23: I had fun Leveling 3 toons within two weeks
[3:28:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[3:28:35] taintalizerx: leveled 2 characters. now back to runescape. nothing to do
[3:28:46] Akoudadis: yeah xp buff is great!
[3:28:47] kokochris: lol
[3:28:55] death_cam_: should also buff rep like they did at end of bfa
[3:28:56] Tharia: I saw so many people the last few days it was unreal lol
[3:28:57] raye_gaming22: who at this point has not lvld yet ? i mean SL is 2 years old
[3:28:58] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee are all WOW Servers still down ?
[3:29:00] Emmanuelxt12: lol
[3:29:02] Kelwinnz: RuneScape or new world for me xD
[3:29:04] reggiepowa: they should permanently increase xp by 100%, lvling is time wasting content anyway
[3:29:05] rfmoore1965: when does the xp buff end?
[3:29:07] XshadowturkeyX: i heard some epople took liek 14hours or less to go from 10-60
[3:29:07] itswilly_g: old school runescape is better than wow rn lol
[3:29:10] TheBroCrow: Tell people XP buff is going away to maximize engagement, keep XP buff to earn good will with players
[3:29:11] xReadyAimMissx: yeah, I just got back after several years of not touching the game. That exp buff was great. danSad
[3:29:13] common_taco: I feel attacked. that's what I'm playing right now lol
[3:29:16] datmikez: hit 70 on my last class back to maplestory
[3:29:18] c0mmander_starscream: I'm back to Wildstar
[3:29:21] orionnhawk: maybe we will all be surprised when servers come up and the buff is still on :)
[3:29:23] destiny25: Just tuned in. How's the day going Hammer Squad?  What the heck up with the music?
[3:29:25] MysticRaven_: i've been enjoying the buff on classic just the server faction balance still sucks im on Gehennas EU ally 0.2% pop
[3:29:27] Funderik: runescape for me too, i'm not ashamed.
[3:29:31] Bereghost: Yeah I wished they kept the 50% increase longer as well, we're close to the expansion anyways.
[3:29:34] taintalizerx: @frowilson yeah im hyped for raids 3
[3:29:40] DevilSpire: i play d2/d3 during downtime
[3:29:50] looney199725: the xp buff gonna be back up for pre patch prob
[3:29:53] Velot_: Have the new talent trees added new spells to the classes, or is it just the current stuff in a new order? @Towelliee
[3:29:58] Dankind64: +50% ends today because +100% STARTS today. EZ
[3:29:59] Fillos08: raiding is fun, but the time commitment  is very high. cut back on the trash and "prep time" and it would be much more appealing. gamer dads like me are more or less stuck with m+, due to it being more flexible time wise
[3:29:59] Darthyrevan: Warrior today?!
[3:30:02] Psyquest: need alpha access so that I can stop with retail season 4
[3:30:08] aumixp: I would actually enjoy s4 more with the exp buff even at 50%.. @towelliee

[3:30:45] codyxmillz: plan on trying the dps specs for warrior at all?
[3:30:52] SauceFu: Loving it. Hosmer still hasn't approved his side of the Soto trade so it can't be made official.
[3:31:11] watpuppy: @Terranuker why didn't you use the xp buff over the past couple weeks?
[3:31:22] darkeagle7561: SMOrc waror
[3:31:22] nephttv_: I'll be arms pre much all week
[3:31:24] plkatv: Warrior content :O plkatvWar
[3:31:26] Molvonos: Baj's going hard in fury warrior for S4

[3:32:17] watpuppy: that's what they claim but i have a feeling they will bring it back since everyone loved it
[3:32:19] Dystilled: It was like 10 days or something dumb
[3:32:20] Bereghost: Yeah same, My wife and I returned to wow with just a few days left of the 50% xp buff so we didn't get to utilize it much.
[3:32:22] SLoPPYALieN: said something about until Season 4 start
[3:32:30] Crypticshock: 3 weeks
[3:32:30] thebakeriscomingforu: XP bonus should be all the way up to xpac
[3:32:31] lloydimus: Aug 16th
[3:32:33] destiny25: They should just let it go through to the Prepatch of DF *The buff*
[3:32:38] temp3st98: next week Kappa
[3:32:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: my guess is 2 weeks
[3:32:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Aug 16th sounds right for Wrath prepatch
[3:32:52] zed_1992: lol

[4:15:41] dimofodi: leveling is fast period, i have 12 chars at 60 and 5 i leveled from 1 to 50 so far
[4:15:45] Diamondead1: buff gives me the incentive
[4:16:00] its____rooster: those that want the buff want blizzard to hold their hand while leveling

[4:16:04] LearnedSomething: I got a couple of heritage sets thanks to the buff
[4:16:06] Glialka: It is fast, but with all the other system that you need to grind it feels long before you can play end-game

[4:43:01] zgag: I think I now have a theory for the soar nerf.  Blizzard was looking at Maxium's stream and saw the fun he was having with soar in the open world outside of Dragon Flight location
[4:43:06] carey1973: They claim the reason they went down on the dragon flying is because it is not fair to older players. I feel if they are like the new hero class they need to feel like a hero class and that means the flying ability.

[4:43:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a weeping willow from harry potter
[4:43:37] strike879: its a tree made of tree
[4:43:49] TophurPlays: I wonder if they plan to tighten up the polygons on the tree so you don't run into them so easily, especially when you're running into the invisible part of the model

[4:44:13] TophurPlays: They're just gonna put boosts on sale next week probably
[4:44:14] krakenfaces: xp buffs towards end of an expansions always happens though right?
[4:44:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: they should have said to go level in classic instead LUL
[4:44:17] TophurPlays: they always do at the end of xpacs
[4:44:17] ArcaneLight: KEKWlaugh what if dragon riding is the way to get your legos? you're fucked
[4:44:22] nesman27: "xp buff? you want an xp buff just give us $60" Kappa
[4:44:26] Akermay: The fact Blizz say it was for S4, is so weird. Surely a fresh 60 can't run these fated raids?
[4:44:27] xReadyAimMissx: you can do it, I believe. danCopium
[4:44:37] PatchesMcPatch: This saying applies to almost every player - give a hand and theyll take the whole arm

[4:45:31] Sleyenda_UK: went the wrong circle first
[4:45:32] duhworks: you went to the wrong ring first
[4:45:32] tornbraclet: i can understand the boosts for classic but for live since the leveling is so fast it makes no sense
[4:45:32] Kisswani: deviated from path
[4:45:33] WarriorMuffins: wrong portal first
[4:45:34] Kale_Nd: follow the Order

[4:45:36] maventar: u missed the ring
[4:45:37] NickLeonhearth: wrong order
[4:45:39] MrJack2013: hit the rings in the wrong order
[4:45:49] CYNIC308: i hope Blizz applies these new flying mechanics to all flying mounts ... not still flying the old static way! i just hope we dont have to wait for the next xpac to get this flying on non dragon mounts!
[4:45:52] DreamSweet: You went to the wrong one
[4:45:59] loutre_malgache: You skipped a ring. Went to a green to theb go back the yellow you were supposed to go.
[4:46:02] DreamSweet: Dang
[4:46:04] smashwow: yeah that "weighty" addition they made to the dragon flight really fucked it up for some people

[4:59:46] loutre_malgache: But legit though, isn't it by default harder for Taurens then ? if you gotta through tiny spaces ? Maybe those races "should" be replaced by "You control a Dracthyr" just for the race

[5:23:07] Neruan: happens in anything not a gaming thing every sport every activity realy
[5:23:08] c0mmander_starscream: NW still has flaws lol
[5:23:22] spookychefkarolina: @neruan exactly
[5:23:57] xhaven: so far this is just attacking the mmo players and putting streamers as the good guys just doing thier best
[5:24:14] Kisswani: KEKW
[5:24:17] CasuallyEfficient: ^
[5:24:20] CrunkyBrewster: shocking
[5:24:21] flebbooo: oh no KEKW
[5:24:22] aikopooh: lol
[5:24:27] Avinar: but it was often lol all the trashing everyone did as content creators really helped push it into the grave imo lol sometimes I feel a lot of content creators overvalue their critical feedback sometimes and not always fair.
[5:24:28] Zynarch: monkaS
[5:24:31] Balkep: typical FF14 andies LUL
[5:24:38] Shrenko: oh no not mmobytes LUL

[5:24:46] Diamondead1: Aware
[5:24:57] Praetour: Where's Pyromancer?
[5:25:19] Templexx: pyro is still raving about wow probably

[5:25:42] Kisswani: LMAO
[5:25:42] zgag: I don't agree with all that. Just because you disagree with a streamer doesn't mean you hate the streamer personally
[5:25:48] CrunkyBrewster: RIP Ff14 Fans
[5:25:49] flebbooo: KEKW
[5:25:53] Cafe0le: KEKW
[5:25:59] mutant21: did asmongold leave twitch?
[5:26:02] Praetour: @zgag you must be new here KEKW
[5:26:02] JeemTeam: oh theey are dead on for FF14
[5:26:08] CrunkyBrewster: I would agree
[5:26:11] Daarksyde: all perspective
[5:26:15] aPandaAppears: @mutant21 no
[5:26:24] sliproach: Blizzard stop trolling me every tuesday i get a email from you never alpha invite always about hearthstone
[5:26:26] Avinar: some of the content creators literally just sit there for a month shitting on the games then act like they are moderate lol. that said it's funny when they are critical on a game and say it's fair but then if someone's critical of them they often get super defensive
[5:26:39] SilkeySmooth: eso's latest update has killed their game..lol
[5:26:40] Balkep: yeah, nerdslayer is a pvp sandbox andy
[5:26:48] BlueBeast33: Nerdslayer's FF14 video wasn't exactly that great to be fair...
[5:26:49] Zynarch: I do play all kinds of games including ff14 and some people are just crazy
[5:27:05] Neruan: its like people suddenly figured out what a fandom is have they never encounterd anyone passionate about a certian sport or even worse team
[5:27:16] Finiin: I logged in to FF 14 for the first time in about a year yesterday.  They were having a very sexual conversion in the sprout lol
[5:27:38] Finiin: channel
[5:28:06] Divinos572: what video is this?
[5:28:12] Avinar: sounds like politics Kappa
[5:28:14] Praetour: @Finiin ffxiv is a very horny game in some spots
[5:28:19] CrunkyBrewster: I think its a mix
[5:28:19] Shrenko: both
[5:28:21] xReadyAimMissx: she's a streamer
[5:28:21] Fugazi811: rage is a streamer
[5:28:27] FeralLikeMe: I've been watching twitch for years now and I don't know who the fuck she is lol
[5:28:28] belfastcl: the teapot
[5:28:30] CrunkyBrewster: i watched some of this when he aired it live
[5:28:31] Skylin3r: why is the gameplay ESO?
[5:28:34] zgag: Of course this is going to happen. More so if you have a big viewing audience
[5:28:34] sshadeh: teapot Pog
[5:28:35] michaelmm: Rage is an Aussie Wow streamer.
[5:28:42] belfastcl: @Skylin3r josh likes eso
[5:28:43] Zivs: this is the guy that talked to Max right
[5:28:46] Shrenko: Teapot <3
[5:28:54] Avinar: teapot is the only info I get on gw2
[5:28:56] xdarkwombatx: @Towelliee Hosmer traded to Red Sox LOL
[5:28:58] TheZofren: hate that aspect of the wow community, impossible to convince my friends to play bc all they know about wow is reddit whining
[5:29:05] Praetour: @Skylin3r because ESO is the perfect game with no toxicity Kappa
[5:29:11] Skylin3r: lol
[5:29:28] xdarkwombatx: Hosmer blocks deal then egts traded lol
[5:29:34] sshadeh: @Zivs ye
[5:29:37] zgag: I would say the wow community or any community in general is bad.  It's more so specific individuals
[5:29:38] spookychefkarolina: I feel childish for saying this but at a certain point I really do wonder why people can’t just let others enjoy what they enjoy. (Within reason ofc)
[5:29:43] zgag: wouldn't *
[5:29:58] sshadeh: and yes, teapot is always high energy like that
[5:30:03] Benend: is fated nathria not out yet?
[5:30:15] CrunkyBrewster: Agreed
[5:30:23] Finiin: @Benend once the severs come up
[5:30:24] dantezalive: @Benend servers arent even live
[5:30:30] CrunkyBrewster: thats what i realized about my own self.
[5:30:34] Benend: ah ok ty
[5:30:36] Avinar: just how many people are involved in this? holy hell
[5:30:44] CrunkyBrewster: im not part of the tribe. im just a passerby
[5:30:51] Dankind64: Zeplaaaa
[5:31:00] Sharkfeet: @spookychefkarolina It has to do  withsomeone trying to justify their choices by putting other choices down to make thiers feel like the best one
[5:31:07] roopi: great sound
[5:31:11] h116_: o don't want to be part of no tribe
[5:31:19] the_bad_goat: What are they even talking about? I missed the first part of him watching this video
[5:31:37] aPandaAppears: @roopi she is trying to find a new home after fleeing from Ukraine so her audio isn't set up
[5:31:44] berserker_strike: Guys how many hours till the next alpha patch ?
[5:32:23] spookychefkarolina: @sharkfeet ah, I hadn’t considered that …. That’s even more upsetting! I wish people wouldn’t influence others like that. Everyone should get to choose what they enjoy.
[5:32:27] Benend: any idea when the servers will be back up for NA?
[5:32:27] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[5:32:35] Praetour: Plus other streamers will go into topics like politics and current events deeper than you do Towel
[5:32:37] ChillinMoose: Its a one way conversation
[5:32:37] mashiesmashie: From having done YT myself, i completely agree
[5:32:42] Avinar: it can also be purely one sided one way or another.
[5:32:44] aPandaAppears: @Benend noon
[5:32:55] Ekazz: It is sooooooooooooo true.
[5:32:56] mashiesmashie: video was either shit or good, no in between convo
[5:33:15] belfastcl: and the tone is usually lost in written text, and tone helps settling discussions out
[5:33:29] FrozenShades: Riot's MMO is gonna be the next one, watch.
[5:33:36] Avinar: like they may not be able to get to actual criticism from some without sorting through a ton of YouTube comments and mostly just seeing a wave of ones that mention the same point
[5:34:01] Praetour: @FrozenShades the league community in an MMO will be literal toxic pools showing up in the world
[5:34:08] Shrenko: @FrozenShades towCopium
[5:34:19] pupu007: who is speaking? sounds like a professional voice actor
[5:34:23] zgag: I don't see much of an issue with communities that are more behaved ( The smaller ones) The larger ones that just have constant spam can be an issue.   (Imo, there is a risk for going after all that $$$$$ to increase the viewer count)
[5:34:29] FrozenShades: @Praetour Thats the MOBA community in general, go to DOTA, its worse.
[5:34:33] CrunkyBrewster: Sadge
[5:34:40] flebbooo: Wildstar FeelsBadMan
[5:34:55] Avinar: idk how many LoL players that would play an MMO though. so not sure if we can assume LoL MMO will be as toxic as the LoL
[5:35:02] CrunkyBrewster: yes I agree there
[5:35:03] dwolters_the_zombieman: i watch lazy peon's videos  lazy peon is cool
[5:35:03] smol_gunner: thats what hes saying tho
[5:35:06] ArcaneLight: i agree
[5:35:25] Skylin3r: towKawaii
[5:35:28] d1ylor1: Fact I play All MMOs , when ever I feel it
[5:35:30] CrunkyBrewster: I mean I watch Esfand when he plays Madden. And I don't evne play Madden LUL
[5:35:34] cookie_jayy: true
[5:35:36] spookychefkarolina: @flebbomate :(
[5:35:48] Gnerdyy: its the genre for me.
[5:35:53] Neruan: i woul sill watch @Towelliee jsut to hear that awesome voice POGGERS
[5:36:18] pupu007: follow a streamer? lol not me, I could care less, I picked you at random and probably won't ever watch you again. Only reason I am watching is because of maintenance
[5:36:21] Praetour: @AllThingsMMORPG couldn't tell LUL
[5:36:21] Avinar: lots of variables to that in general
[5:36:31] MokeXD: I am only watching wow 😀
[5:36:35] CrunkyBrewster: yup
[5:36:35] UltraKSlaya: As long as you are able to adapt, you are fine
[5:36:37] Ordicos: think it do with hype and bang of new games while MMO`s take time and long hours to fully open it up
[5:36:47] Beggebin: Definitely depends on the game/streamer for me. Some games I'll watch anyone play. Some streamers I'll watch play any game. I can't speak to how people feel about this in general though.
[5:36:57] zgag: Good point
[5:37:08] Avinar: sometimes I won't watch a game until it's a certain streamer. I want to watch gw2 content but Idc for any of them but teapot
[5:37:09] CrunkyBrewster: lik that one guy Krip. He still plays Hearthstone. He's not homeless
[5:37:15] dwolters_the_zombieman: i don't mind what the streamer streams
[5:37:42] FrozenShades: Are they ever gonna fix New World?
[5:37:42] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[5:37:45] michaelmm: The views they got for New world at the start weren't sustainable that's all!
[5:37:45] CrunkyBrewster: LUL
[5:37:51] itsDets: LUL
[5:38:06] Avinar: blame him and his 500k views on videos getting it killed!
[5:38:41] Praetour: Lockdowns ending being responsible for loss of views too, 2020 - 2021 were weird years for streaming
[5:39:17] pupu007: is this warframe? looks pretty good
[5:39:24] jkitchin75: can you swim in new world yet
[5:39:24] Gnerdyy: true and real.
[5:39:27] magicclicker: True
[5:39:30] xReadyAimMissx: @pupu007 yeah
[5:39:33] flebbooo: yeeep, still going
[5:39:36] AxelyuS7: true
[5:39:56] nightwolf_87: wow is the bitcoin of crypto
[5:40:01] Avinar: xiv is a very seasonal game so has long droughts and WoW often has something to do imo the rest don't touch
[5:40:10] aPandaAppears: no1BASED
[5:40:15] h116_: I used to watch wow streams on Justin and I didn't even play it at the time
[5:40:26] pupu007: I completely agree, wow very consistent
[5:40:42] Avinar: ESO and gw2 seem hard for that
[5:40:43] Sharkfeet: WoW is consistent the problem is breaking into the viewership
[5:40:58] Sharkfeet: People watch the huge streamers very few people watch smaller WoW streamers
[5:41:08] luckfore: ff14 has 6k viewers, wow 10x more now
[5:41:09] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Man, fuck Azmon
[5:41:13] EzPickenz1: Servers Down?
[5:41:21] pupu007: lost ark any good?
[5:41:33] CCG_337: 4k is bad for asmongold, because his numbers
[5:41:34] FrozenShades: @EzPickenz1 Still, yeah.
[5:41:36] xReadyAimMissx: yeah but if he went down to 4k viewers, imagine how many all the other streamers dropped.
[5:41:36] Praetour: @Sharkfeet because why scroll down to see what the fuss is if you can just assume the highest views will be the most entertaining, same with any category on twitch
[5:41:37] scumlucki: @Sharkfeet cause most of wow streams is die hard pvp people prolly just wanna chill
[5:41:39] tornbraclet: i would rather watch a smaller streamer than a larger streamer
[5:41:45] goofywizard: sounded like towelliee went to heaven
[5:41:45] Avinar: if you like what lost ark is and brings I think lost ark is amazing.
[5:41:47] Holysal: @pupu007 its a good game but not for everyone
[5:41:48] Balkep: @pupu007 if you want a full time job instead of a game LUL
[5:42:10] pupu007: oh wait a second, I tried lost ark... not my style
[5:42:21] scumlucki: @Balkep id say wow is more of a job than lost ark
[5:42:34] kha1leesi: extended till 1
[5:42:36] CCG_337: fiixiv is only one game, the umbrella that covers wow include classic and retail, it is like 2 games under th same game
[5:42:43] kha1leesi: BibleThump
[5:42:48] Beggebin: Love that feeling
[5:42:51] Mallaes: BibleThump

[5:43:06] Subjektive: b.net app says 1pm
[5:43:14] PacManFever_: Says 1 now
[5:43:17] Sharkfeet: @Praetour You  are spot on, its the same with all of twitch. But him saying its consistant is still a misnomer
[5:43:20] Divinos572: its 1pm now
[5:43:26] Madve: true
[5:43:29] flebbooo: real and true
[5:43:30] itsrambo: ppl already on the M+ leaderboards for S4 lol

[5:44:02] DreamSweet: Yep it says 1 now lol damn
[5:44:13] Badziee: 100% true
[5:44:16] Avinar: it was on an upward trend already , asmongold rode the wave, but he made a badlands chugs splash in it
[5:44:17] CrunkyBrewster: he brought it to a lot of eyes
[5:44:18] scumlucki: tanking in ff14 is so fun
[5:44:20] QuesoFM: true
[5:44:23] Shrenko: like Zepla
[5:44:36] temp3st98: He made so wow isnt the only mmo out there
[5:44:47] luckfore: and now everyone returned to wow
[5:44:48] belfastcl: before asmongold in ff14, the ff14 category was almost on pair with the eso one
[5:44:50] Funderik: they talk about viewers going down, but not the climbing during a patch, they just judge it by it's peak and think that's the norm.
[5:44:59] Ekazz: Current maintenance has been extended until 1:00pm (PDT). We apologize for any disruption and hope to restore service quickly. @Towelliee
[5:45:00] Naywils: It was already growing before he played though, so not all him
[5:45:06] Sharkfeet: But most people dont watch MSQ...
[5:45:15] Functionalidiot: gahhh, 4pm now :(
[5:45:18] Balkep: lots of people started playing FF14 way before that though

[5:45:35] LearnedSomething: that seems a bit far fetched dude
[5:45:45] Jack_the_Dipper: @Towelliee Asmon was playing Raft last month and I bought the game and playing it atm :D
[5:45:50] luckfore: it has 6k now lol
[5:45:55] ContraRob: the FFXIV directory is dead again
[5:45:56] Noshpan: FFXIV is also an anomoly in that it's the only MMO that failed at first & then succeeded
[5:46:05] flebbooo: yeeep
[5:46:08] Texas_Mizfit: 1pm pst now
[5:46:14] Sharkfeet: Ya he did help but FF has been a huge game even on twitch logn before  Asmon
[5:46:19] scumlucki: @Noshpan That the Yoshi P magic
[5:46:20] Holysal: @Noshpan lost ark as well
[5:46:24] LearnedSomething: and he's carrying it into dragonflight
[5:46:25] GroovyBryan: ff14 is still not pulling as many views as wow.
[5:46:28] LearnedSomething: I don't see the problem :)
[5:46:31] Joneeeez: I really hope ashes of creations will be fun to play
[5:46:36] xhale2nhale: I mean it's still kinda dead even now
[5:46:36] pupu007: I remember logging into FF14 when it first got released... remembered thinking... what the heck is this and immediately uninstalled

[5:47:41] Texas_Mizfit: grim rail depot was bugged during timewalking might be trying to fix it
[5:47:44] Sollice: @Towelliee They have NEVER learned the rule of downtime. You ALWAYS over quote how long it will take and when you go under the time you look amazing. If you bring it back up the time you said your not a liar
[5:47:44] Avinar: xiv 1.0 cutscene was a comic book for me

[5:52:40] xhale2nhale: sadge RDO community, beautiful game thougj

[5:53:01] smol_gunner: Slootbag*
[5:53:19] Avinar: channel in shambles
[5:53:30] N3llee: you have prob as much as all them combined
[5:53:35] Featherbow: they're just becoming repetative. They've already said all this
[5:53:43] thejangoshow: @Towelliee  Ya you keep the sklll you've learned!
[5:53:46] Neruan: isnt streaming in the simplest for kinda a "cult of personality" if that stays it shoudl be fine
[5:53:50] stallowned: true
[5:53:51] thejangoshow: no matter what happens
[5:53:51] Avinar: towelliee suddenly plays LoL loses 90% of viewers Kappa
[5:53:54] Holysal: @smoltankz he doesnt lose 90% though
[5:53:55] xhale2nhale: @dracullus it's every game he touch, watch DF, you'll see a "why I returned to WoW" n then a "why I quit wow" vid after
[5:54:05] lithium364: build relentless Kappa
[5:54:08] Avinar: mud can't be molded
[5:54:15] UltraKSlaya: confidence is key
[5:54:16] dracullus: @featherbow it feels like this video has no substance at all
[5:54:29] Featherbow: @dracullus yup. not a bit
[5:54:46] spiked16: they usually lose viewers after changing their usual Genre or game
[5:54:49] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: sounds about right lol
[5:54:54] Praetour: Probably because they ride the trains of hating/loving the game and then when they dont have something to comment on those two types of feedback/gameplay their views go
[5:54:58] Avinar: exactly that's why it's confusing to understand where this comes from
[5:54:58] Keyastaron_: ooooof warframe
[5:55:03] Zynarch: LUL
[5:55:04] smol_gunner: @smoltankz i've seen him talk about about this on stream a year ago, he cant do variety
[5:55:09] Shrenko: MMOBYTE sucks
[5:55:09] itsDets: LUL
[5:55:17] Avinar: maybe it's because mmobyte only plays weeb mmos
[5:55:17] smashwow: so a net 30% loss Kappa
[5:55:19] Featherbow: they're just talking in circles. it's so annoying
[5:55:21] Neruan: its like they asume they will fail to break into a new markt lol
[5:55:28] Henke1983: Henke1983 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[5:55:30] Templexx: yea bad take by him
[5:55:31] Grimrg: words
[5:55:35] ButSureLook: You might not think you are, but viewers do
[5:55:38] N3llee: Max is someone I consider an authority
[5:55:38] Balkep: "respect mah authoritah"
[5:55:39] Kisswani: you can taser players Kappa
[5:55:40] Praetour: You have control over our gameplay of course towelliee
[5:55:41] kokochris: yup thats a bad way to describe it
[5:55:44] Avinar: I read blue text
[5:55:44] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:55:44] mavericks312: authority is a bad term
[5:55:44] Bloodhaven08: Yo are you a wow cop?
[5:55:47] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Bruh, this dude is really trying to make himself a bigdick larry.
[5:55:53] Funderik: it's another way to describe their ego. they know all.
[5:55:54] Evokados: When does s4 start?
[5:55:54] Skylin3r: it's someone you need to rebel against Kappa
[5:55:55] PrimalRain: They trust the persons opinion. Max would be one for WoW I guess
[5:55:56] smashwow: idk i've seen people move from GW2 to WoW and go from 1k to 100 views avg @Towelliee
[5:55:56] SlithTheSivak: not ever mmo has a wowhead equivalent so they need content creators
[5:55:59] ArcaneLight: more like a beacon
[5:55:59] Fr4nkyb0y: extended for another hour :D
[5:56:02] N3llee: authority is just a term for like subject matter expert.
[5:56:05] xhale2nhale: mmobyte is a YT, his video are mostly MMO news or fail week mmos
[5:56:06] dracullus: I bet Preach thinks he's authority
[5:56:07] Templexx: *views as authority* *calls streamer dad* lmao
[5:56:12] jkitchin75: @thatoneguynobodylikes352 who
[5:56:17] duhworks: no
[5:56:19] N3llee: @dracullus cause he is
[5:56:22] Avinar: @towelliee they want to claim a better name for themselves over "influencer"
[5:56:23] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @jkitchin75 the dude in the vid
[5:56:26] Balkep: it's over, Towellie, you're not an authority anymore Kappa time to give up
[5:56:28] Kuzzo99: towelliee is just built different
[5:56:29] Adventw0lf: Respect my AUTHORITEH
[5:56:30] Kinghorn: someone call the authorities
[5:56:31] truf4x: yes
[5:56:34] mistr_pockets: You're an authority on hammers
[5:56:36] flebbooo: Thats like the people saying Preach can't have his opinion on wow anymore, its cringe af
[5:56:36] duhworks: yes you are
[5:56:37] ice_cream_dog: fk no lmao
[5:56:37] DrakeDuude: u didn't, but preach seems to of lost some with the community
[5:56:39] mistr_pockets: Game-agnostic
[5:56:39] kokochris: You are a professional, thats more accurate
[5:56:40] cinnamints: You're right, he's describing an extremely weird way to view entertainment media made about other entertainment media.
[5:56:40] Kakotan2143: yes you are @Towelliee
[5:56:41] PvtHudson093: extended again by an hour :(
[5:56:41] Templexx: authoritehhhh
[5:56:41] SerMonstein: Towelliee is a authority on fun tanking
[5:56:45] mavericks312: authority is a terrible term
[5:56:46] TheGiant99: having drops helps numbers
[5:56:48] Praetour: Towelthority
[5:56:49] Xilyane: erspective
[5:56:50] belfastcl: it means you are an expert in a certain field
[5:56:51] Subjektive: i feel like you are an ambassador more than authority
[5:56:52] dwolters_the_zombieman: this video is so negative
[5:56:55] SquatchDa: some people just can't think for themselves I guess
[5:56:56] Templexx: its just a bad word to use
[5:56:56] Avinar: I'm an authority of lore Kappa
[5:57:01] BoringBrit: is it because these guys do mostly youtube
[5:57:02] LearnedSomething: you're an authority on the subject of authorities, evidently
[5:57:06] N3llee: putting to much emphasis on authority. Its more about being subject matter expert.
[5:57:07] c0mmander_starscream: I am the authority of NY Pizza
[5:57:08] smashwow: i think the context he's going for is you're a pillar of the community etc etc etc @Towelliee
[5:57:16] Avinar: he mostly plays niche games
[5:57:19] QuesoFM: think they mean someone who knows a vast amount about a game so you can come to them for advice
[5:57:19] nesman27: its prolly more through a youtube lens than it is a twitch lens
[5:57:21] duhworks: that guy is somewhat right tho
[5:57:21] thegreat0phi: i would say a good term Streamers are called is a information advocate
[5:57:21] Holysal: mmobytes plays amine mmos
[5:57:23] ButSureLook: If I had to choose between watching an informative video between you or a new WoW youtuber. I'd choose you. Thats what authority means, not that you are in charge or anything
[5:57:36] Orthobullet: Extended agane
[5:57:38] pigzip: @towelliee Don’t question your Authoritii
[5:57:45] N3llee: very true
[5:57:46] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I think the thing this video is really missing is the concept that someone can be an "authority" on being a gamer. People enjoy watching you play games, they follow you to other games.
[5:57:47] sliproach: @c0mmander_starscream ok gunna need some recomendations
[5:57:54] Avinar: too much time investment for a lot
[5:57:57] bowsers1: 1 MMO is enough
[5:58:04] Skylin3r: never
[5:58:08] ArcaneLight: i tried most mmos, very few that i liked
[5:58:09] Mattsta: very true...when ffxiv blew up it amazed me how many streamers were first time players of it
[5:58:19] bowsers1: i want to push hard 1 MMO
[5:58:20] Neruan: there is so much downtime in all mmos to paly multiple
[5:58:24] lithium364: where is the cuban confidence in these youngsters
[5:58:28] Balkep: LUL
[5:58:36] Djfarmville: authority squadHYPERW
[5:58:37] itsDets: KEKW
[5:58:38] Skylin3r: it depends on what you want to get out of said mmo
[5:58:40] Avinar: "influencer"
[5:58:48] dwolters_the_zombieman: we got Towelliee who is never negative
[5:58:49] Mojohusk: Respect mah authoriteh!
[5:58:50] Templexx: we need south park authoritehh emote
[5:58:53] temp3st98: It's the youtuber talk LUL @Towelliee
[5:58:55] BearOfLight: just take authority as interchangeable with the word trust in this context
[5:58:57] Dradugun: He is not inaccurate, due to survivorship bias. You won't see the people that fail literally because they don't get the views anymore
[5:58:57] strike879: they really dont know what it means
[5:58:58] Kakotan2143: I am a MMO player, I am not an authority on any of them as I am a casual player
[5:58:59] Featherbow: THEY'RE TALKING IN CIRCLES. ugh. they're ALL saying the SAME. THING. over and over and over again
[5:59:00] smol_gunner: @Avinar exactly its the influencer mentality
[5:59:00] captiv8: the hell is that chick wearing?
[5:59:02] zgag: Shadowlands Season 4 Maintenance Extended to 1:00pm PDT
[5:59:04] Funderik: bullshit take
[5:59:04] xhale2nhale: I'm good with WoW as my main MMO n maybe a alt mmo but WoW takes all my time
[5:59:06] labrhat: Was the word part of the question or themed topic for this interview? It seems to be plastered throughout
[5:59:10] Balkep: Towelliee, you're not satisfying me as a viewer Kappa
[5:59:15] stallowned: authority KEKW
[5:59:18] dracullus: she says that to guy who does exactly that
[5:59:25] Kinghorn: what are we watching who are these people
[5:59:29] MWilco77: what is she even saying
[5:59:29] Molvonos: RESPECT MUH AUTHORITAH
[5:59:30] Kwurky: They're using "authority" in a really classist way.
[5:59:31] jhajden: who are these people anyway?
[5:59:34] Praetour: All of these were handpicked and recorded to fit the theme of the vid I wouldn't put too much thought into it
[5:59:42] pupu007: I can't play multiple mmo's
[5:59:43] xhale2nhale: I guess they never been on Twitch much
[5:59:45] BigHeroSixy: I as a viewer demand satisfaction Kappa
[5:59:45] luckfore: towelliee isnt an authoirity, hes the GOAT
[5:59:49] Neruan: there are planty of people how sink hours uppon hours into smt and are still not knowledable or good or waht ever what matric is this LUL
[5:59:57] pupu007: if I do then neither of the mmos I am playing is capturing my interest
[6:00:05] DrBrumm: they speak as the where scientists... so shallow
[6:00:09] cicatog_13: youtubers saying about stream :(
[6:00:13] smashwow: towel having an aneurysm. i get it though. this is a little triggering
[6:00:14] Gregadeaux: Blizzard sent out an email saying CN is Now Live...
[6:00:15] Quojin: NO We're looking for entertainment
[6:00:19] sliproach: towelliee isn't an authority hes' the resistance
[6:00:23] Kisswani: huh ?

[6:00:28] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Wait...they're just countering each other's points. One is saying that the people need to have super in depth knowledge to talk to harder core players, but then the 2nd indicated that most players aren't looking for harder core gameplay videos and guidence.
[6:00:34] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I'm so confused.
[6:00:36] JakZones: I think the people on this podcast or whatever are trying to get all players of a game to watch their videos. What you have done, and many others have done is curate a community
[6:00:42] DrBrumm: big words nothing behind, nothing more nothing less
[6:00:44] Balkep: time to start a drinking game
[6:00:47] BearOfLight: theyre using authority in the same way its used with scientists in a specific field, its not that they control things its that they are trusted to know what they are doing and talking about. That is the context of the term in this use case
[6:00:47] strike879: i think they were meant to use notoriety but failed english class
[6:01:06] sliproach: @Balkep i'm on
[6:01:09] sliproach: *in
[6:01:10] Ariea_Whisper: >
[6:01:12] Avinar: I sort've agree since I haven't cared about the people who play an MMO for a week and their opinion since they don't know the depth. like gw2 was getting mega hyped but teapot went into the mundane and details saying why it's not being looked at and the flaws and balance issues etc
[6:01:12] BigHeroSixy: 14 algo is wild
[6:01:18] Zenzhal: this is why i dislike some content creators.. they do believe they are so far above other players its a little sickening as someone who've watched all these channels LUL
[6:01:26] Balkep: @sliproach LUL

[6:01:50] zenkodac: BearOfLight appealing to authority is still a fallacy when it comes to discussing topics
[6:02:01] slowfar: what is he watching?
[6:02:01] Kinghorn: zepla kelpYay
[6:02:04] Templexx: lol b/c they are entertaining. making something out of nothing

[6:02:13] Darzetti_: why do i get adds as a sub?
[6:02:14] Featherbow: time to mute the stream until this video is over. x.x
[6:02:15] Kakotan2143: Zepla is ALL ABOUT FF14 and has a crazy story about escaping UKraine @Towelliee
[6:02:32] Noshpan: I cycle through 3-4 MMOs on the regular to keep from burning out.
[6:02:39] flebbooo: KEKW
[6:02:45] Avinar: dang now to wait for all the ads
[6:02:49] BearOfLight: @zenkodac thats true, im just clearing up the use of the term, because it is being used properly in the context, just not woth the most common definition that people are used to
[6:02:51] IggiePuff: IggiePuff subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 65 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[6:02:58] dwolters_the_zombieman: this is a definition of a shit show video they cry over something instead of realizing what they have in front of them some people don't get to do what they do
[6:03:01] temp3st98: Typical zepla right there LUL
[6:03:12] GiveLoveLive: ffff 1pm now
[6:03:13] strike879: that coffee is long cold
[6:03:13] Templexx: be entertaining. case and point.
[6:03:19] smashwow: that was a haymaker not a pot shot LUL
[6:03:34] zenkodac: BearOfLight yea i get it, it is indeed a term that can creat confusion
[6:03:34] c0mmander_starscream: EVE Online is not on that list

[6:03:49] Eggz1004: did you see they extended maint @Towelliee
[6:03:50] Xilyane: he is doing variety stuff
[6:03:51] xhaven: lol
[6:04:08] bowsers1: '' i quit covering world of warcraft ''
[6:04:13] c0mmander_starscream: AoC coming soon to a winter near you in the year 20StarCitizen
[6:04:13] Praetour: He meant if they don't have at least 1 player after 6 months
[6:04:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: cant quit if ashes never releases
[6:04:31] sshadeh: well, ashes wont come till 2037 so he still has plenty time to be mmo content creator Kappa
[6:04:31] captain_khyzan: sorry I agree with @Towelliee ! All i hear is Cartman from south park screaming "RESPECT MY AUTHORITY" not the right word for the topic... i dont consider anyone as a streamer a authority, take multiple people to write articles on wow or create guides, no 1 single authority
[6:04:36] pupu007: what's going on with ashes? I paid them over 1 year ago
[6:04:46] Avinar: "enhance"
[6:04:48] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I love NCIS

[6:06:42] bowsers1: What about wow ?
[6:06:49] Templexx: lmao

[6:08:32] dracullus: I saw his clip that he don't want to support Blizzard because their unethical practices while playing SWOTOR by Bioware/EA xD
[6:08:46] Mallaes: @Towelliee On How long to beat, it says that WoW takes around 2364 hours 🤷
[6:08:54] Corruptwarrior: the dude is comparing reviewing a non mmo to an mmo
[6:09:01] Adventw0lf: @Towelliee ya I can't read. It's 2364. https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=11286
[6:09:04] kokochris: Thats not a proper comparison
[6:09:05] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @dracullus or Square and their predatory business practices and work/life interactions
[6:09:48] dyslexican1: Some of these takes are mindblowingly clueless. Those are not even the same ganra of games... they are not comparable.
[6:09:49] captiv8: i don't like the way he is holding his coffee cup, its kind of....tilting....me
[6:09:58] dwolters_the_zombieman: this guy is so obnoxious

[6:10:46] Extreme_EG: lol you can make 10 videos per 100s of mmo
[6:10:50] thatoneguynobodylikes352: You could make 100 videos into your MMO in 100 hours.
[6:10:51] Dradugun: ??? you'd need to stream for 14.5 hours a day, without editing time, to hit 100hrs in a week
[6:10:51] Extreme_EG: 100hrs
[6:10:57] Skylin3r: he's saying you need to put in 100 hours for it to be a "valid" review
[6:11:08] mhmmtasty: yall sound salty that JSH pooped on your fav game lol
[6:11:14] dracullus: @lithium364 MEAT IS BACK ON MENU BOY.. oh right I don't have Alpha

[6:11:52] captain_khyzan: never been a fan of josh strife, he only scratches the surface of games and gives reviews that for some reason alot of people take as written scripture atleast thats my opinion, kinda a shallow jack of all trades but master of none...
[6:11:54] mhmmtasty: call it bait, but its what youre doing lol
[6:11:55] bowsers1: thats our boi

[6:14:33] whteraven_: what's your favorite expansion of al time?
[6:14:34] r0b928: If you play 100 of an MMO you can make several videos of your experience, not just a review video. That guy was not doing a good comparison
[6:14:35] OSHA_Violations: someone clip that
[6:14:56] wrightcody2323: I have a couple hundred hours of running circles in oribos I need to make an authority vid of how fun that shit actually is

[6:15:37] Azazel_3x6: neckbeards
[6:15:40] zenkodac: if you need to "reach" anything for a game to be fun the game is missing the mark
[6:15:46] Avinar: why they are in patches? can rate patches too
[6:15:47] Captainkappa123: Do we know when phase 4 will start?

[6:16:38] MangoSZNRyn: KAPOW KAPOW
[6:16:43] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Look, I've played wow from day 1. I played GW2 for a week. I can tell you I don't like the game. The systems are toxic and dense, the game doesn't share information well, and the combat is very swingy. I'm an "expert" on MMOs, because I have the 10000 hours needed to be one. So I can safely say it's not a game for me. Look, I made a review, pay me IGN.
[6:16:46] captain_khyzan: this is why you need content creators who do enjoy and master 1 game... contrary to what they were saying earlier... people will seek out the top main streamers of a particular game for a more honest and in depth gameplay review.
[6:16:53] dwolters_the_zombieman: hey i put so much hours since the original TBC does that make me an authority lol
[6:16:57] Fierced: @Kinghorn he said just boost, as in on retail getting a max level char by buying it from the blizz store...
[6:16:58] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Oh wait I forgot "A little something for everyone, 7.2/10"
[6:17:01] Tozazu: @towelliee Content creators should be cautious with reviews moving into 2023. The laws for defamation vs. opinion becomes even more muddy. So examples like this could be seen as slander without definitive evidence. duckLook duckHuh lirikTEN
[6:17:14] StewFry: i disagree.
[6:17:14] Kinghorn: I know Fierced LUL
[6:17:21] looney199725: like theres people who have played since classic and dont understand 60% of the game
[6:17:22] looney199725: lmao
[6:17:30] mhmmtasty: yeah you dont need to spend x amount of time playing a game to know you will not enjoy it or will, hell i didnt even have to do anything but watch ff14 to know it just isnt for me
[6:17:35] kokochris: 1) here is what ive done 2) here how i feel about what I have done 3) these are the things you can do next  pretty simple..

[6:23:28] Menion01: Who the fuck waits for a "content creator" to play an MMO for 100 hours to validate their opinion on the game?
[6:23:34] mashiesmashie: your New World content was awesome
[6:23:37] N3llee: yea they fixated on that 100hrs mark
[6:23:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: hit 100 hour in the middle of a dungeon and just leave right then because you experienced enough
[6:23:38] dimofodi: I've been on a work call so muted and unmuted randomly and every time I do they sound pretty non-intelligent...which is why they might feel things struggle if they don't do these specific things.....lol
[6:23:39] magemaster225: tbf your marathons are about 100 hours

[6:24:01] PickASh0e: Reviews Gatekeeper
[6:24:02] Phaedrin: I think they're basing it on FFXIV's ARR story hours because people always say you can't judge until later expansions
[6:24:02] SerMonstein: It is strange to see come up a lot in Joshs videos comments and live chat.
[6:24:04] nesman27: the GCD
[6:24:06] Neruan: hell i dont like ff14 cuz of the gcd that didnt take long to notice
[6:24:06] dyslexican1: Tey have to have pulled this 100 hour nonsense from some toxic andy that has said it at some point. Those nuts are the minority of players
[6:24:11] Praetour: 100 hours = level 7 in Classic WoW makes you an expert
[6:24:17] aladinsane444: Unless content creator spends 129 hours 36 minutes and 23 sec their opinion is invalid
[6:24:19] Kinghorn: that was me
[6:24:20] ArcaneMaki: 100 hours < No Authority 100 hours > Full Authority @Towelliee
[6:24:21] TheItalianStallion321: need to watch stream for 100 hours until i can review
[6:24:22] Kinghorn: :D
[6:24:27] SilverFox_Gaming: I think the question he asked them was what time do you think would be good so you have a good grasp on the game to review it
[6:24:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: i saw no appeal in new world from the beginning
[6:24:38] looney199725: there speaking out there ass honestly

[6:25:06] BunnyMountain: 100 hours in biomutant ? how lol
[6:25:07] Balkep: 20 hour in Biomutant, that's some endurance
[6:25:09] BearOfLight: also, hours played does not equal competancy or skill. I cant even tell you how much time ive spent playing wow. definitely in the thousands, maybe tens of - im fairly knowledgeable, but im no expert, im no pro.

[6:25:11] TheItalianStallion321: @Towelliee Yankees traded Joey Gallo
[6:25:12] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Can't be an authority on KOTOR because it's only a 20 hour game. Need to play it 5 times to be an authority.
[6:25:15] BigJustin26: great storyline
[6:25:21] Effin_Steffin: 99 Hours 20 Mins. GTFO
[6:25:23] Avinar: 8 care about a good leveling experience but for an MMO.  I want to know details on if I'm wasting my time and if it's good at first but boring later. difference in what I want vs a normal RPG game
[6:25:25] BigJustin26: oh no the sniper, it's the operative
[6:25:28] spookychefkarolina: @bearoflight same!
[6:25:29] Sleyenda_UK: finishing a game in 7 hours ect doesn't make you an expert

[6:26:41] Kuzzo99: skip is illegal
[6:26:48] spookychefkarolina: Idk how they don’t find that 100hr metric offensive, as to become an “expert” in many other things/careers you need far more than 100hrs to even become “intermediate”.
[6:26:50] Avinar: straight to jail
[6:26:56] Sielu11628: This video is odd AF

[6:27:13] looney199725: lmao these people are dumb honestly
[6:27:15] Brannax: throwback to when I made an alt and got through to the end of base 2.0 in one 17 hour session. Man that was stressful
[6:27:16] Balkep: some of these creators are delusional LUL
[6:27:17] lekkahdh: towDance towDance towDance
[6:27:20] Kakotan2143: I DO NOT Agree with Zepla on that
[6:27:21] ArcaneMaki: "If you could change ya fate, wouldg'ya?"
[6:27:22] looney199725: you can review a game whenever you want
[6:27:26] zysmos: the story obviously makes it a great game KEKW
[6:27:29] thiccsushi: evergreem
[6:27:29] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I have a review on FF14 without any playtime. It takes 1500 hours to get to the content I want to play, it's a bad game and shouldn't be played.
[6:27:32] lel3owski: evergreen
[6:27:32] K_A_N_J_I: Wait, so anyone that has played 100 hours and make 1 YouTube video is considered an authority? We broke the code. We can all be authorities
[6:27:33] dublive: @Praetour I have a max level toon I get it lol
[6:27:33] thiccsushi: green*
[6:27:35] teeq_010: josh talks to much

[6:27:42] jetributions: towWipe towWipe towWipe towWipe
[6:27:46] Featherbow: actually, people are "allowed" to review whenever they want, considering reviews are just opinions. this is very weirdly gatekeepy
[6:27:55] looney199725: the fact zepla even made that comment is funny
[6:27:56] smashwow: ever green
[6:28:04] Balkep: 100 hours every patch, let's go LUL
[6:28:05] ArcaneMaki: I was not expecting Comedy Central quality of content from this vid
[6:28:06] dwolters_the_zombieman: what the hell are these people smoking
[6:28:07] aPandaAppears: these clowns spent 100 hours talking about how they don't ahve 100 hours to play an MMO
[6:28:11] mhmmtasty: ff players really think that story is gods gift
[6:28:22] bowsers1: twitch > youtube
[6:28:27] smashwow: ever green = things that will live on xpac to xpac, patch to patch @Towelliee
[6:28:28] xhale2nhale: ext 4 pm est now
[6:28:40] stallowned: youtube is worse man
[6:28:43] Zenzhal: it seems that these people or creators dont have any passion for what they are doing, and they are just chasing the money. And therefor they get lost in the statistics of how to make a efficient Video rather then a topic your already passionate about.. and the thing is, if you got passion for a game you have already at least put in 100+ hours LUL
[6:28:52] gelimarr: As someome who works 12h a day, sometimes its nice to watch a yt vid of the highlights
[6:28:57] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @mhmmtasty FF players think FF is god's gift. Such a tribal fanbase
[6:28:57] Washymyballzz: wow so insightful
[6:28:58] spookychefkarolina: At what point does that mentality become gratuitous
[6:29:02] Skorb: @teeq_010 Its what he does and I think the you tube algorithm rewards him for it.
[6:29:03] looney199725: zepla legit sounds up her own ass with that comment
[6:29:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: got to fight that youtube algorithm
[6:29:08] Gnerdyy: it sure fucking is a race though.
[6:29:09] zysmos: you have to min max on youtube that's crazy
[6:29:11] Kakotan2143: MY biggest grief with FF14 is that the game FORCES you to do dungeons and trials when i am playing my game and doing the story. +
[6:29:12] Tozazu: @towelliee I do find some content creators believe they are valuable, but they aren't. Very fee are trusted and most is just filler, incorrect or ignorant of the real communities.
[6:29:15] zenkodac: Zenzhal ikr just a bit of honesty in the goals would go a long way
[6:29:18] Praetour: "I played 8 minutes of Dragonflight and heres what I thought"
[6:29:19] Avinar: "WHO CAN TOUR NEW MAIN CITY FIRST?!"
[6:29:20] stallowned: yup
[6:29:24] Balkep: with the mandatory soy face and an arrow

[6:30:00] stallowned: that and the worst clickbait titles/thumbnails lol
[6:30:04] Antdavs24: Who can put out content first always, doesn’t matter if it ts insightful
[6:30:05] PvtHudson093: KEKW
[6:30:06] looney199725: i sometimes think content creators forget there just people there not special
[6:30:07] Syrc0: If I want to see your reaction to something I will watch your Twitch VOD. cohh1Guy
[6:30:22] aladinsane444: If you are mmo youtuber just make a fan service video where you repeat current talking points and dont forget to mention asmongold so he reacting to it

[6:31:00] Manse06: Non wow players reacting to WOW cinematics does well
[6:31:03] mhmmtasty: such back and forth wishy washy opinions
[6:31:13] Menion01: Whoa is ME. My job is hard. Therefore go to minimal effort content.
[6:31:13] bawheid: its far easier and quicker to make a reaction vid than it is to create original content
[6:31:14] bowsers1: '' WOW is dead ''
[6:31:17] looney199725: zepla isnt even done all the game cuz she said she hasnt done the hardest mode of FF so she has no right to make reviews by that logic

[7:28:33] Diamondead1: alliance cant see Custom
[7:28:39] scrubishtone: i cant see the post for some reason, 271 holy priest Scurbishtone Area 52
[7:28:43] jkitchin75: @rleo2 no
[7:28:44] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  dont forget the quest for boss kills
[7:28:47] Samiccus: @Towelliee im not sure if custom can be cross faction listed
[7:28:52] JustTrim: @SollowJP if you have anima, you can buy 226 gear in zerith mortis for 500 anima per item, after that its real easy to do stuff

[7:29:00] Effin_Steffin: @sollowjp I quit playing for 6 months, came back and all my toons are 260+ with no effort. It’s very easy
[7:29:00] Diamondead1: @Towelliee you are under Custom not Raid so alliance cant see the group
[7:29:12] JustTrim: @Towelliee someone said the quest is inside the raid
[7:29:15] matthewkshearer: Should pop up when you enter the raid I think

[7:29:55] Truthseeker96: FOR THE HORDE
[7:30:16] ArcaneMaki: Damn totally forgot that Cross Faction grouping is now a thing
[7:30:17] Lothawia: its because you have done a custom group so alliance players wont see it
[7:30:23] Knocx: zero mages lol
[7:30:27] temp3st98: It's because you queued under premade group instead of raids
[7:30:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cross faction is awesome.....just a little while ago we wouldn't have thought it was possible
[7:30:38] Eraste: my entire guild (not that many people, but still) got mecha keys... ffs blizz

[7:55:09] LeDerpski: there ya go
[7:55:13] impa1nful: is this retail or classic
[7:55:19] Keyastaron_: is that right @Towelliee  252 for noraml from vault
[7:55:24] NOHITJEROME: the fated mechanics seem very interesting, similar to the mythic+ affixes
[7:55:29] the_general01: @impa1nful does this look like classic lol
[7:55:29] UltraKSlaya: retail
[7:55:33] Dagomarus: This is clasic shadowlands Kappa
[7:55:39] Scoodles91: are there bottles at normal ? :D
[7:55:53] jkitchin75: so what lvl does lfr drop

[7:56:26] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:56:27] NOHITJEROME: Is this the first time that WoW is revisiting previous raids mid-expansion?
[7:56:27] impa1nful: @the_general01 dont gottas be a dick about it
[7:56:41] NOHITJEROME: The fated idea seems really smart to rejuvenate old content
[7:56:54] Rottencoarse: @NOHITJEROME yep
[7:57:00] Rottencoarse: @NOHITJEROME also yes
[7:57:12] NOHITJEROME: One of the most exciting possibilities is a cata+ with some dragonflight tie ins, maybe a new zone, some balancing tweaks @Pr1m0x21
[7:57:17] NOHITJEROME: might be a good bridge between classic and retail
[7:57:18] wraaith: @Towelliee zorbrix tweet
[7:57:18] the_general01: @impa1nful if i was being a dick, i would have called you an idiot or something. i didnt. its all good chief

[7:59:33] Shredmuffn: @Rottencoarse oh thanks for some reason my game did update automatically had to do manual
[7:59:36] jkitchin75: @NOHITJEROME no way thats going to happen
[7:59:42] Pr1m0x21: @nohitjerome interesting
[7:59:55] NOHITJEROME: Do you think they'll do a normal cata launch after WOTLK? I don't know how well it would do @jkitchin75
[8:00:35] Dagomarus: If i was them id make wrath the last classic, i dont think theres alot of demand for cata classic

[8:06:44] ptgTruk: @Towelliee What UI addons are you using? For Nameplates, Raid Frames etc?
[8:06:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Need moar Grimrail Depot
[8:06:54] Kneckt: Value: 15 Avenger's Shield Hurls your shield at an enemy target, dealing (52.416% of Attack power) Holy damage, interrupting and silencing the non-Player target for 3 sec, and then jumping to 2 additional nearby enemies.
[8:07:02] Kneckt: shield is fixed lol
[8:07:08] NOHITJEROME: I'm excited for the interface changes, I like what blizzard is doing
[8:07:10] abracka_: looks like stance dance is coming back, "Stances are currently a work in progress and undergoing internal iteration. A large part of their goal is to guide the fantasy of each spec but mechanically, the goal for these is not to encourage frantic stance shifting. But rather switching at certain major points in an encounter, such as For DPS Warriors during a painful AOE damage phase, or for Protection Warrior that are off tanking they may temporarily switch to deal more damage."
[8:07:17] NOHITJEROME: slowly implementing addons directly into the game
[8:07:50] sliproach: mage nerf Rank 1: Reduces magic damage taken by 3000%3%. Rank 2: Reduces magic damage taken by 6000%6%. :O
[8:07:51] NOHITJEROME: That logic makes sense, constant stance swaps are annoying
[8:07:54] ptgTruk: @Towelliee What UI addons are you using? For Nameplates, Raid Frames etc?
[8:07:57] Dagomarus: Some people killed xymox last week and back seeing him this week, the cycle of xymox continues
[8:08:03] abracka_: yeah it looks like they want to avoid stance dancing returning
[8:08:44] PTGfry: @Towelliee What UI addons are you using? For Nameplates, Raid Frames etc?

[8:09:21] PTGfry: thanks
[8:09:26] KaceonTV: When does the invite wave usually happen? The build just got pushed to alpha servers.

[8:09:42] NOHITJEROME: this is harder than mythic for sure @zouran2021
[8:09:53] druidhex: Oh so the old 278 ilvl from  S3 is good enough to run normal?
[8:10:06] zgag: What will be the meta class/sped for CN
[8:10:34] Dagomarus: @druidhex if anything being 278 already is overkill for normal
[8:10:43] Zouran2021: @NOHITJEROME TY. so norm>heroic>mythic>fated? new order of progression?
[8:10:48] NOHITJEROME: xymox lore is cool, I like that he's only here to benefit himself and isn't loyal to anyone LUL
[8:11:05] NOHITJEROME: tbh it doesn't seem much harder but maybe they are just really good @zouran2021
[8:11:12] elchaposkjelbo: u need 3

[8:15:13] JustTrim: @leelo4673 yes
[8:15:21] Dagomarus: Yeah i always used to tank this solo, as a dk, deaths advanced saved me from having to do tactics in this fight
[8:15:30] JustTrim: you wanna be *that guy* who just quit wow to never return? dont be that guy @leelo4673
[8:15:52] llNoTToXiCll: @leelo4673  are you a die hard fan yes if not you dont really need to come back if you don't want too
[8:16:03] KaceonTV: When does the invite wave usually happen? The build just got pushed to alpha servers.
[8:16:05] Dagomarus: And still no loot Kappa
[8:16:22] Leelo4673: @justtrim is it worth coming back though? Didn’t like SL that much. Played since BC
[8:16:45] JustTrim: @leelo4673 probably not right now its end of expansion, dragonflight for sure though
[8:16:49] nibenwen: holy talents by any chance?

[8:18:24] Leelo4673: from what you have seen
[8:18:26] Dagomarus: Having those final talent points will be nice on all specs too, to test true endgame
[8:18:31] Zilberg: Unless it’s still by the vault but at the entrance like last season… idk if they moved him @eraste
[8:18:36] NOHITJEROME: they brought kaelthas back? LUL

[8:21:59] NOHITJEROME: good use of colors and everything
[8:22:15] NOHITJEROME: well it's a fantasy game maybe the skull can fight too @Mint_Fanatic

[9:10:37] Rexialiton: @zeuussss_ Thank you mate
[9:10:48] Ishva: nice
[9:10:49] chillmodez: is this heroic?
[9:10:55] Mr_Pennywise_: towDynt towDynt towDynt
[9:10:59] kokochris: yA
[9:11:00] Kneckt: 291
[9:11:01] Armdel: probably cant trade it?
[9:11:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: 285 weapon sounds good
[9:11:06] Dagomarus: 285 weapon Pog
[9:11:16] Funderik: 300
[9:11:18] Funderik: on hc
[9:11:29] Funderik: it's +15 right?
[9:11:39] watpuppy: lol you definitely don't want to burn hard and fast in this boss
[9:11:43] watpuppy: in phase 1
[9:11:50] Tigerklaue: best boss in the expansion
[9:11:59] Praetour: +12 per difficulty
[9:12:09] Dagomarus: For his cleave
[9:12:14] watpuppy: @Towelliee If you burn too hard and fast, you won't be able to drop enogh stacks of the debuff and you will all die
[9:12:20] Dagomarus: He cleaves to lose stacks
[9:12:46] Dagomarus: You will want to get your group cleave, kill adds
[9:12:49] watpuppy: @Towelliee He will put several stacks of debuff on all players that you need to drop
[9:13:25] watpuppy: This boss definitely requires coordination in phase 1.  the rest of the phases you can probably just burn hard
[9:13:52] Cassini_: What is the relevance of the pink circle?
[9:14:08] woltk2024: how easy is normal fated ?
[9:14:17] Tigerklaue: ww heaven
[9:14:28] Featherbow: you have to have it pointed at you, one group at a time
[9:14:34] watpuppy: i think you need to drop like 3 each?
[9:14:36] drunch85: 3?
[9:14:51] Dagomarus: Less than 3 id say
[9:14:56] watpuppy: been a while since i did this
[9:14:58] geros2013: 2you are completely safe. 3 you need roar probably
[9:15:05] drunch85: 2 with stampeding roar if iirc
[9:15:09] lrddoom: 70%
[9:15:11] geros2013: 70%
[9:15:20] Dagomarus: 3 is dicey af
[9:15:28] watpuppy: yes but roar requires you to time it right.  you can't roar once he does his hase pushback
[9:15:31] watpuppy: phase*
[9:15:49] watpuppy: RUN
[9:15:50] geros2013: you are at 1
[9:15:59] geros2013: you have removed 5

[9:16:04] watpuppy: LOL
[9:16:06] watpuppy: like 15
[9:16:08] Gunfluster: you are supposed to drop the stacks
[9:16:09] drunch85: 11 :P
[9:16:31] Strifelol: Each cleave reduces the amount of stacks you have.
[9:16:32] Tigerklaue: 0-1 > no movementspeed cd 2-3 you need a movementspeed cd
[9:16:35] watpuppy: @Towelliee No you can have zero if you want but it's not necessary to get that low
[9:16:36] drunch85: 3 stacks makes you too slow
[9:16:50] geros2013: 0 is ok but you cant take another frontal
[9:16:55] watpuppy: you start with higher stacks and you need to lower your stacks
[9:16:57] Dagomarus: 2 is fine, 3 dicey, 4+ is rip
[9:17:02] Mattsta: having 0 is fine at transition...you don't want to get hit by the cleave with no stacks
[9:17:17] Tigerklaue: or play dk and ignore it
[9:17:26] Cassini_: Can someone please tell me what the pink circle is? What is it doing?
[9:17:28] Strifelol: Stampeding roar when he grips you and that will help
[9:17:35] Dagomarus: @tigerklaue deaths advance dont work on this
[9:17:37] watpuppy: no, the soak was not done correctly.  everyone who died needs to soak more
[9:18:14] watpuppy: no, you do it in groups so you get fewer adds at a time
[9:18:18] Armdel: isnt it to not spawn too many adds or something like that
[9:18:22] Heathen_6six: @Cassini_ its his mouse.. its a weak aura so he can see it
[9:18:28] Dagomarus: You dont want to get everyone at once because of the adds damage
[9:18:46] Cassini_: @Cassini_ Thank you!
[9:19:02] hammack52: and this is the reason this mechanic will never be used again
[9:19:09] UltraKSlaya: it is normal Towelliee
[9:19:13] UltraKSlaya: we just all stacked
[9:19:15] watpuppy: @hammack52 this mechanic is awesome
[9:19:55] hammack52: not really, its easy but it makes it to where you cant but smash his face in
[9:20:07] hammack52: have to time it
[9:20:14] geros2013: pally can freedom themselves too
[9:20:19] watpuppy: @Towelliee Priests can pull slow players into the middle when it happens as well
[9:20:36] geros2013: Freedom
[9:20:43] cdoht: yo
[9:21:09] Dagomarus: Your silenced so he shouldn’t be able to bubble
[9:21:22] watpuppy: No they die
[9:21:27] watpuppy: adds die there
[9:21:41] Vile_: Dead hunter KEKW
[9:22:01] Dagomarus: Tank where adds are
[9:22:14] watpuppy: yes
[9:22:29] watpuppy: doesn't really matter technically
[9:22:32] Vile_: Tanking Remornia always ate my ass :(
[9:23:01] drunch85: do the cones towards the adds, theyll get a debuff
[9:23:05] Strifelol: I have PTSD from this fucking boss LMAO
[9:23:06] scumlucki: warrior talents look fun
[9:23:14] Dagomarus: Coolest looking ability imo that remornia slice
[9:23:20] Strifelol: P1 lag was unbearable
[9:23:40] Armdel: i like this boss personally
[9:23:49] watpuppy: @Armdel This might be the best boss fight Blizz has ever done.  It's so thematic
[9:24:04] Dagomarus: Yeah you go through  mirror then back through when ability is over
[9:24:27] Dagomarus: Then pull it out and rotate to the east and west adds
[9:25:45] Mattsta: on normal, the circles are just get them out of raid...on hero and mythic the spawn orbs you need to soak
[9:25:46] Tigerklaue: doesnt he drop the bis caster trinket?
[9:25:48] Dagomarus: Nothing on normal, on heroic its a a soak
[9:26:16] watpuppy: yeah this fight is no joke on heroic

[9:39:16] SensationalBanana: They really gotta make the landing a bit more fluid and visual... XD
[9:39:24] llNoTToXiCll: honestly i think they should take out flying in all the zones and have Dragon riding as its new flying feature  instead of just being able to fly

[9:51:51] theoldgodmd: then its a perfect time. tons of content to explore and do @mugen1989
[9:51:57] Chiraakitteh: @mugen1989 In that case any time is a good time
[9:52:12] llNoTToXiCll: @i__tv  what expansion was it good in again its been awhile since that talent had been out
[9:52:13] Shrenko: thunder clap a talent now
[9:52:15] Shrenko: wow
[9:52:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having to spend a point on thunderclap doesn't feel good
[9:52:24] Artful_Dodger: @mugen1989 For sure. Take time in each zone and read quests for the lore, ignore what other players are doing.
[9:52:33] scumlucki: still no alpha invite sadge
[9:52:36] llNoTToXiCll: @i__tv  thats exactly right yup
[9:52:36] yurenne4: @theoldgodmd @Chiraakitteh Thank you very much guys. I am grateful for your comments @Artful_Dodger
[9:52:42] Chiraakitteh: @mugen1989 Plenty of time to try out a few classes and find one you love
[9:53:23] Dagomarus: Low level tanking gonna be rough with these trees, leveling through dungeons will be interesting
[9:53:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spreading rend would be a damage increase
[9:53:49] Snabido: Rend, clap ass, rend everywhere
[9:53:49] theoldgodmd: @mugen1989 also dont be tricked into buying the complete edition, you dont need it. all you need is a sub for now to play both normal WoW and "classic". - if you then decide you want to continue playing past level 50 then get the expansion
[9:53:54] hammertime023: Rend one, then clap to spread
[9:54:01] Dagomarus: Rend is a choice node on the mid left
[9:54:04] scumlucki: couldnt you also whirlwind and red?
[9:54:13] Shrenko: good for kiting
[9:54:16] llNoTToXiCll: i kinda like that you can talent into warrior  and its class but i still wish it could be mixed into the other classes for cookie cutter builds But i do see how they set it up tho
[9:54:38] da_zwagli: die by the sword for port
[9:54:44] da_zwagli: pog
[9:54:45] llNoTToXiCll: Specs not classes sorry
[9:54:49] Snabido: Yo, thats hot for prot
[9:54:49] Dagomarus: 30 more rage is is decent tbh
[9:54:57] rymerre: yep just like arms/fury can take shockwave now
[9:55:18] yurenne4: @theoldgodmd I see. Do u think one month sub is enough to understand for game is fine for me ? I am asking for sub. Because in my country payment 6 month sub has some good discount.
[9:55:19] Wheatmist: Wheatmist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[9:55:19] kyshen3: i really like the trees like a lot..
[9:55:35] UltraKSlaya: pvp talent
[9:55:39] jmalmin: You can get 15% leech. That is allot of leech.
[9:55:40] scumlucki: we gotta spec into titans grip as fury scumUHHH
[9:55:46] Dagomarus: Thats a soul bind thing isnt it
[9:56:12] da_zwagli: only single nodes are good
[9:56:23] rymerre: too bad armor doesnt do shit anymore
