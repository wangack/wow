[1:38:17] FaroZod: its fast and cheap
[1:38:33] kafteinn: Just bought 400 g on sod, time is money unfortunatley
[1:39:16] nordman8: BOP
[1:39:26] exec92: 400g for wat
[1:40:12] kafteinn: Quality of life. pots, mount later and what not.
[1:40:40] nordman8: youre way behind exec
[1:41:04] exec92: waiting for you pokiFlirt
[1:41:15] nordman8: loggin loggin
[1:42:37] kafteinn: When you find yourself an old pos with a wife and a child and no time, you just go buy gold, no time for farm
[1:42:56] NeverSeenSun: what serv u play SOD?
[1:44:01] swanovan: I love being broke :)
[1:44:03] kafteinn: Work 1 hour or farm for who knows how long... Also the server shall remain a secret. And My char name is not the same as this twitch name
[1:45:58] GejleOpa: kinda bozo admitting you buy gold and not thinking that every1 in here thinks ur a scum hm
[1:46:30] exec92: buy gold buy consumes buy gear get bis log off didnt even play the game EZ
[1:48:39] GejleOpa: you can easily play the game with 30gin your pocket
[1:48:53] frostowowo: ice cube on reck jaja
[1:50:37] speedzombie: @exec92 EZ
[1:50:55] Berg1642: why did they only bad GDKP in SoD :(
[1:51:17] GejleOpa: cuz its fking money laundrying
[1:51:28] Berg1642: it forces a degenerate playstyle, its not fun
[1:51:31] GejleOpa: ye i figuered
[1:51:34] frostowowo: hatewatchers pepeLaugh
[1:51:38] nordman8: im very glad its banned now
[1:51:47] nordman8: not one more maitozSLAM
[1:52:12] Berg1642: its not about buying gold u moron, its about every group that is formed is GDKP
[1:52:12] GODDAN_gdn: to go and spend that gold farmed by bots on the AH
[1:52:24] Berg1642: regular pugs are suffering
[1:52:39] GODDAN_gdn: spend it on items farmed by bots*
[1:53:03] petstorehero: and you think those people are gonna go to regular pug runs where you never win anything? all the runns gonna be HARD RES
[1:53:23] GODDAN_gdn: wym pugs are sugffering, there are close to 0 gdkps on living flame compared to sr or ms>os
[1:53:44] FaroZod: imagine beeing part of a real guild with real human and weeky raids. commitment and progression - and wipeing on lk hc 5 months in
[1:53:59] FaroZod: gdkp is the way
[1:55:41] petstorehero: guilds always screw you, they make last minute changes to the loot rules all the time for someones favor
[1:56:12] petstorehero: never had that in a gdkp, you either get loot or you get gold, its never a waste of time
[1:56:27] GODDAN_gdn: i prefer playing with a guild, but have a hard time comitting to the set times
[1:56:54] frostowowo: its cuz reg pugs suck dick vs gdkp
[1:56:59] Meachop: what a shit take about gold buying honestly. I personally dont care cuz i dont play this dogshit anymore. GDKP and gold buying alienates lots of players and discourages new players. Very simply, you're surrounded by the people who have stuck around regardless. Echochamber
[1:57:16] nordman8: RAGEY
[1:58:02] nordman8: !roll
[1:58:02] GODDAN_gdn: if ur good u prefer gdkp or LC if u play bad u prefer ms>os or sr
[1:58:03] Nightbot: nordman8 rolls a 57.
[1:58:04] petstorehero: yes exactly, regular pugs suffer because its a waste of time, its such a low chance of ever getting anything
[1:58:12] HOMWHEL: that doesnt apply to the casual daddy that isnt a regular, hes not getting invited unless hes a big bayer
[1:58:17] CruchTV: join a guild then
[1:58:49] exec92: i want guaranteed rewards for raiding BabyRage
[1:58:50] CruchTV: i see
[1:58:54] exec92: tokens gold BabyRage
[1:59:06] kylar_tv: GDKP get recked!
[1:59:10] nostri1: thats only cus you have so much gold from playing so much tho
[1:59:17] nordman8: exibit A
[1:59:30] exec92: !roll
[1:59:31] Nightbot: exec92 rolls a 44.
[1:59:32] petstorehero: most people saying all this about gdkps never did one, avg payout in bfd was like 15g, all those "big buyers" lol. its 95% regular people
[1:59:34] nordman8: :)
[1:59:40] tromic: Thankfully we have warcraft logs to filter out the shit players
[1:59:47] nostri1: if gdkp is the most popular form of pugss it basically forces you to buy gold cus you need to show a budget no?
[1:59:50] CruchTV: can u get into a gdkp without having a giant stack of gold
[1:59:58] GODDAN_gdn: @petstorehero i did a gdkp the other day and got 3g payout kekL
[2:00:07] GODDAN_gdn: items are free atm
[2:01:14] nostri1: im super happy they're banning gdkp in sod
[2:01:16] GrovesyM: GDKPs are great fun. The problem is botting as always has been
[2:01:24] GODDAN_gdn: @nostri1 why?
[2:02:10] tromic: The next thing the gdkp whiners will be crying about is being gatekept by logs
[2:02:15] tromic: It will be glorious
[2:02:16] CruchTV: i think the gdkp system is fundamentally good. but it does take the soul out of the game and everythings just transactional
[2:02:23] kylar_tv: cause GDKP = swipe card for gold = more bots = bad for the game. Now they get fucked
[2:02:31] GODDAN_gdn: @tromic 100%
[2:02:53] tromic: GDKP was the literal only way a dog shit player could play with good players
[2:03:02] tromic: And now they have 0 chance
[2:03:16] frostowowo: @kylar_tv clueless, the fact that there were almost no gdkps on sod launch but there were still hundreds and hundreds of hunter bots in the outside world
[2:03:34] GODDAN_gdn: @kylar_tv you can farm 50-100g in a day questing that will get u into a gdkp, so the problems are bots not gdkp, ppl will still buy bot farmed items on the AH
[2:03:39] frostowowo: the gdkp mass didnt start happening till way later
[2:03:56] Meachop: So because bots exist - real money raids are fine?
[2:04:01] dejlicious: thats true, sod gdkps were way less frequent at the start, now there's a lot of them
[2:04:26] petstorehero: Wait do you really think this will make gold buying go down at all? The auction house didnt get banned lmao
[2:04:57] MacEleven: @petstorehero it 100% will be reduced but its a cop out
[2:05:17] frostowowo: i honestly think this gdkp ban will change nothing
[2:05:54] petstorehero: gold buying will absolutely not go down at all, gdkp run loot was cheaper than boes on the ah. People who buy gold do it because they dont like to farm, they will not start farming for consumables now
[2:06:39] nordman8: !som
[2:06:42] nordman8: Sadge
[2:07:10] PhokingTV_: gdkp ban increased the price of consumables
[2:07:12] GODDAN_gdn: legit 90% of my classic guild bought gold in p1-p2 since flasksa was like 300g ea
[2:07:14] PhokingTV_: and arcane crystals
[2:07:23] PhokingTV_: imagine 6 alts needing flask every week
[2:07:30] PhokingTV_: competiting against bots
[2:07:39] PhokingTV_: without gold intake from gdkp
[2:07:50] petstorehero: guilds selling runs wasnt banned, boosting wasnt banned. Gold is always king. gdkp was just a loot system, its ALL dirty gold out there
[2:07:55] boogey_trihard: over all the game is shit we all saw it on wintergrasp then on pvp bots then this SoD bullshit when u try to kill lk hc without a buff b4 u had all the dogbugs in ulduar this company clearly doesnt care and his addicted community either just quit
[2:08:09] q5classic: maany ghost mushrooms
[2:08:21] kylar_tv: yea better quit bro
[2:08:22] swanovan: Think that's me camping Uldaman next phase, hoping for a pendulum KEKW
[2:08:28] MacEleven: GKP is a legit way to make gold and get the gear you want with minimum effort in managing loot. removing GDKP is a cop out basically admitting you cannot stop the gold buying
[2:08:48] Meachop: They cant - you're their customers
[2:08:56] Meachop: Blizzard and the sellers
[2:09:08] Meachop: wow players have done it to themselves
[2:09:50] Meachop: Everyone else has moved on
[2:10:04] frostowowo: @Meachop cope, im sure all you people will realize soon enough that this will change nothing to the ammount of bots and gold buying
[2:10:13] MacEleven: People automatically think "oh that guy has 100k to spend on a piece of gear! hes buying gold!" when the reality is hes attended 15 GKPs without seeing the item and it allowed him to save the gold up.
[2:10:18] Meachop: idgaf about the bots
[2:10:26] MacEleven: thats the missing perspective non GKPers
[2:10:34] CruchTV: @Meachop copium
[2:10:42] Meachop: I play OSRS - not copium
[2:10:45] Meachop: bots everywhere
[2:10:46] frostowowo: @Meachop then whats your problem lul
[2:11:26] MacEleven: Bots are good, also. they keep material prices down
[2:11:28] frostowowo: @Meachop difference is i like bots in osrs for cheap consumes :) bots in wow make shit unbuyable for a normal human
[2:11:30] Meachop: You alienate new, returning, and less invested players by allowing GDKP. It's entirely reducing real player numbers. The people who stick around are the ones coping
[2:11:59] Meachop: @frostowowo clearly u dont know the bots are clearing endgame content in that game
[2:12:00] frostowowo: @Meachop how do you alienate them ?
[2:12:13] GODDAN_gdn: @Meachop not like GS and logs do that anyway
[2:12:25] Meachop: great - so as i said - your shit community is the problem
[2:12:34] frostowowo: @Meachop yeah thats why shadow, the most common megarare in the game is still worth 1.4b while even bots are clearing 500s :)
[2:12:40] nordman8: woah
[2:12:42] Meachop: And you cope by saying we cant fix bots and my friends like buying gold
[2:12:42] dejlicious: you alienate them by not allowing them to participate unless they're willing to spend a lot of gold, thats how KEKW
[2:12:52] nordman8: botters are people too
[2:13:09] exec92: logging on to report some gdkps peepoSalute
[2:13:10] GODDAN_gdn: @dejlicious that way u ateals get gold to carry a noob kekw
[2:13:31] frostowowo: its funny because im an osrs player and was new to wow with sod and i didnt feel alienated at all and even particiipated in gdkps once i learned how they worked
[2:13:57] nordman8: where is Bus when you need him
[2:13:57] Nightbot: mn route: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_SRVgvE7oI outdated, but 5% off with code "MN" https://www.restedxp.com/ref/mnrested/
[2:16:07] MacEleven: Get rid of gold buying = GDKP still exists  Get rid of GDKP = gold buying still exists
[2:16:15] MacEleven: what the fuck
[2:17:03] CruchTV: @MacEleven "dont fight cancer its really hard to get rid of it so just let it happen"
[2:17:06] Meachop: The issue being they "cant" remove gold buying but they can remove GDKP raids
[2:17:13] exec92: one less thing to buy gold for OkCat
[2:17:20] nordman8: DISCO
[2:17:22] exec92: should remove consumeables too
[2:17:24] gavin_gavin_gavin: fuck it just bid with real money on discord
[2:17:31] nordman8: remove wow = peepoComfy
[2:17:39] Meachop: remove soulbinds
[2:17:42] Meachop: let em all trade the gear
[2:17:42] GODDAN_gdn: LFM PAYPALDKP
[2:17:52] kabobhead: remove wow = shorts
[2:18:03] kabobhead: yoshiJAM
[2:18:18] nordman8: corntastic
[2:18:30] nordman8: Clap
[2:18:45] exec92: @kabobhead a better world
[2:18:53] nordman8: GetOutOfMyHead i cant listen to these bids
[2:19:00] CruchTV: for sure
[2:19:11] petstorehero: so anyway, back to that monkeynews cam stream
[2:19:28] frostowowo: @Meachop they can also remove the AH then NO MORE BOTS YAY !
[2:19:39] Meachop: again idgaf about the bots
[2:19:53] GODDAN_gdn: removing all trading and ah would actually remoce the problem
[2:20:05] GODDAN_gdn: if you consider it a problem
[2:20:07] frostowowo: again ur taking a shit stance that cant be attacked, and ur being petty about it
[2:20:10] MacEleven: That would cause so many other problems
[2:20:14] MacEleven: use ur brain
[2:20:27] Meachop: Stop adding bots into my problem with player behaviors
[2:20:32] Meachop: it's toxicv
[2:20:51] GODDAN_gdn: good luck fighting toxicity
[2:21:01] frostowowo: believe it or not i think its the games job to protect the players from themselves against gold buying :)
[2:21:14] Meachop: they just banned GDKP to do thjat
[2:21:15] nordman8: gl with that then
[2:21:31] GODDAN_gdn: surely there was no toxicity before gdkp???
[2:21:34] exec92: Leddit
[2:21:35] frostowowo: mate get it through your head, gdkps are not the reason for gold buying
[2:21:38] Eversincex: Leddit
[2:21:59] Meachop: GDKP just exacerbates the issue
[2:22:02] Meachop: correct
[2:22:06] Meachop: There will always be cheaters
[2:22:07] RBLfraekkesen93: what is this song

[2:24:46] kingslipry: cope
[2:24:50] RBLfraekkesen93: prefox is so fucking cringe with that .1 increase
[2:25:40] RBLfraekkesen93: Fucking get involved Prefox. Aim for their dicks
[2:25:51] GODDAN_gdn: i mean doing that on every item over an expansion should add up to a bit, 900g saved per item
[2:26:03] GODDAN_gdn: hes 5head
[2:26:45] daggerslife: is paying to a mage for boost in sod also now forbidden ?
[2:27:06] GODDAN_gdn: @daggerslife could be,, but its not made clear
[2:27:16] RBLfraekkesen93: Not as of right now I believe. But could be soon tho
[2:27:35] kingslipry: wym Reddit gamer dads love gdkps lol
[2:27:35] GODDAN_gdn: we'll see what the system detects as "gdkp"
[2:27:42] frostowowo: redditors want retail
[2:27:52] daggerslife: pfffttt... i planed to level just 1 character and wanted to buy boost for the rest of my alts..hope they dont  jeezus idiotism at its finest
[2:27:54] GODDAN_gdn: @kingslipry no they dont, they hate it
[2:28:00] kingslipry: no they just cry about bots
[2:28:01] frostowowo: yeah they hate them
[2:28:21] kingslipry: bro 90% of the game is gdkps
[2:28:24] GODDAN_gdn: they love to quit the game and camplain about it
[2:28:26] kabobhead: reddit opinion BatChest
[2:29:31] daggerslife: so now i have to get back doing rolls just so when i finally once in my life outroll someone get ninjaed..fkn bs
[2:29:48] kingslipry: join a guild loser

[2:29:56] daggerslife: not everyone can commit mr LOL
[2:29:56] GODDAN_gdn: they hate gdkp, minmax, ranking everuthing that takes more than 30min gameplay a day
[2:29:59] FaroZod: 4 upgrades here better buy em all
[2:30:05] kingslipry: ok make your own group
[2:30:15] CruchTV: @daggerslife u cant arrange 3 hours out of a day in the week?
[2:31:01] daggerslife: yes ofc i can church , guilds want commitment for the same days each week and i got 7 months old and shift jopb i cant say i can come same days , my off days are totally different each week bro
[2:31:17] Meachop: If you can't commit to a guild you dont deserve their roster spot. If you can spare 50 you can go whenever u want and it'll be smoother than your nan
[2:31:22] daggerslife: wtf is this thinking "u cant have 3 hrs "yes i can ... i cant commit to strict schedules is what i said
[2:31:33] nordman8: iveseenit

[2:35:35] 1_Squeezy: one advantage is that it s not corrupted
[2:35:37] FaroZod: horse is 3k woah
[2:35:43] q5classic: u can afk on trash in SR runs and still roll :)
[2:35:44] kingslipry: sr is fine if the roster doesn't change
[2:35:44] 1_Squeezy: peoople doont have to buy gold to buy their items
[2:36:00] Nightbot: https://discord.gg/82HNwP5 Important updates & announcements are posted in my Discord. Post music (similar to my genres of music) that you think I'd like in the #music channel catJAM
[2:36:19] luwiko: SR is corrupted because shitters have same chance of gear as the good players, no benefit to actually being good
[2:36:26] kingslipry: gdkp advances the death of the economy
[2:36:27] Frothybrew: the vibes are fuming today lmfao
[2:36:36] RBLfraekkesen93: SR within the guild
[2:36:38] RBLfraekkesen93: What on earth
[2:36:39] Meachop: The econ died in vanilla
[2:36:42] Meachop: tf?
[2:37:10] FaroZod: stopbeingMean
[2:37:13] kingslipry: good players? i go to a gdkp and the worst players have full 277 every slot
[2:37:20] kingslipry: it's irrelevant
[2:37:21] 1_Squeezy: you lose fairt and suare tho
[2:37:22] nordman8: xn lost every single gressil Madge
[2:37:27] MacEleven: our guild does open roll for mains but alts have to pass to mains
[2:37:42] 1_Squeezy: yoou lose too rng
[2:37:43] MacEleven: we mostly all pass loot to eachother if its bis for someone
[2:37:44] GejleOpa: just becasue you can justify gdkp with "if i farm my gold why not" while playing most of your time wow - doesnt mean its the right way to do it. it promotes gold buying, botting and so forth, bannable offenses. whats the discussion about. if you care so much about loot thats what guilds are for imho
[2:37:53] 1_Squeezy: not to who has the most money in real life
[2:37:59] 1_Squeezy: MMOO shouldnt be related to IRL
[2:38:04] 1_Squeezy: it should be disconected from it
[2:38:08] MacEleven: then you save gold for next run
[2:38:09] dejlicious: real and true
[2:38:09] kingslipry: rolling for loot is bad buying loot with your trustfund is worse
[2:38:15] kingslipry: all there is to say about it
[2:38:24] GODDAN_gdn: @GejleOpa the AH promotes botting aswell
[2:38:31] daggerslife: +
[2:38:33] 1_Squeezy: there shoould be NO LINK whatsoever between who you are IRL and who you are IG
[2:38:37] GODDAN_gdn: all comsumes promotes botting
[2:38:45] petstorehero: you lose a roll have nothing, you lose to gold now you have gold
[2:38:45] GejleOpa: @GODDAN_gdn it does and its a shame  ye
[2:39:05] kingslipry: swedoids dropping their whole welfare on gdkp xdd
[2:39:09] kingslipry: epic
[2:39:12] RBLfraekkesen93: Would you rather instead of hair on your head, have one big nail or be sweating mustard
[2:39:24] 1_Squeezy: so whats the difference between SR and Lootcouncil ?
[2:39:51] luwiko: A big one is also that you must stay till the end in gdkp for payout, in SR runs you just SR early bosses and leave when you wipe once later
[2:40:01] 1_Squeezy: yeah but you know that it s always transform into CLC
[2:40:15] kingslipry: why we talking about pugging tho
[2:40:24] 1_Squeezy: because of human nature
[2:40:28] kingslipry: gdkps killed the guild scene
[2:40:32] kingslipry: atleast on na
[2:40:45] MacEleven: The solution to people buying gold isnt ban GKPs. Straight up cope answer to botting
[2:40:45] daggerslife: players did, players choice what they want bro dont u get it
[2:40:49] 1_Squeezy: you CANNOT be impartial with friends
[2:40:51] daggerslife: if u have 90 % gdkp thats what ppl want ?
[2:41:05] kingslipry: yea it is what ppl want cuz it's ez
[2:41:07] Meachop: You have 90% GDKP cuz players quit
[2:41:12] FaroZod: @MacEleven blizz cant ban bots. its 75% of all subs
[2:41:13] Meachop: Thats why blizz is banning it
[2:41:13] 1_Squeezy: he can
[2:41:14] ren0: preach
[2:41:17] Meachop: it's effecting their bottom line
[2:41:21] daggerslife: ez or not .. it does not change the fact it is what ppl want
[2:41:22] 1_Squeezy: if he farmed legitimatly his gold
[2:41:26] kingslipry: and being a gm turns into unpaid job to paid job with gdkps
[2:41:26] 1_Squeezy: YES
[2:41:27] GejleOpa: he canbuy the loot, but most prolly he buys the gold for it
[2:41:30] 1_Squeezy: if he buys his gold
[2:41:33] nordman8: he makes the pugs suffer
[2:41:33] 1_Squeezy: HE IMPACT EVEERYBODY
[2:41:49] 1_Squeezy: by buying he creates a demand right
[2:41:54] kingslipry: everyone wins with gdkps except the ppl who don't do them
[2:41:55] 1_Squeezy: the demand creates a market
[2:42:00] kingslipry: and those ppl suffer
[2:42:00] 1_Squeezy: the market fucks up the game
[2:42:06] senjuros: problem is you only get a slap on the wrist for buying gold, problem isn't gdkps
[2:42:14] guts_cg: i love gdkp community
[2:42:18] 1_Squeezy: i already told you
[2:42:21] sugaa666: im ok with gdks, gold buying and botting is what affects me
[2:42:27] GejleOpa: you get week long bans for buying gold
[2:42:28] MacEleven: the people who spend thousands on gold for GKPS are maybe like 1-2% of GKPers
[2:42:28] 1_Squeezy: IF GDKP exist with only the gold you farm
[2:42:30] 1_Squeezy: its fine
[2:42:42] 1_Squeezy: the problem with gdkp is it creates a black marrket of gold buyerrs
[2:42:44] GejleOpa: weeks long*
[2:42:48] 1_Squeezy: it CREATES INFLATION
[2:42:52] Meachop: very simply there's LESS WOW PLAYERS cuz of GDKP and BLIZZARD is banning them because THE GAME IS DYING
[2:42:52] 1_Squeezy: market makes inflation
[2:42:58] MacEleven: Faps are cheaper because of bots, removing that will make them more expensive
[2:43:02] kingslipry: someone i know said a blizz employee in their guild said that gdkps make banning gold buyers way harder
[2:43:04] guts_cg: @1_Squeezy u shold try a gdkp come to the dark side oooo
[2:43:04] MacEleven: so the market argument makes no sense
[2:43:04] 1_Squeezy: so the guy that farms his 100g fair and square
[2:43:11] nordman8: less wow players sounds like a good thing
[2:43:12] 1_Squeezy: gets fucked by the guy that just buys it in 1 asecond
[2:43:20] MacEleven: @1_Squeezy how does it affect you
[2:43:23] kingslipry: i mean bro what was ur peak gp/h in sod
[2:43:24] MacEleven: it doesnt
[2:43:26] MacEleven: case closed
[2:43:27] kingslipry: playing legit
[2:43:28] 1_Squeezy: it affects you if you dont buy golds
[2:43:29] ren0: inflation is the biggest lie
[2:43:33] ren0: look at wrath
[2:43:36] ren0: everyhthing is cheap as fuck
[2:43:40] GODDAN_gdn: idk i i belive the argument, ther bot create a huge supply of consumes driving the prices down
[2:43:41] kingslipry: not really
[2:43:45] ren0: you can do 1 quest and have a weeks worth of consumes
[2:43:45] 1_Squeezy: if you just farm your gold yuou will never be able to BUY an item
[2:43:52] 1_Squeezy: so you need to buiy gold too if you want an item
[2:43:57] MacEleven: not true lol
[2:44:00] 1_Squeezy: so it comes back downn to whoever has the most nmoney IRL
[2:44:01] MacEleven: get better at making gold
[2:44:05] kingslipry: haste pots are 5x price since ulduar wtf r u saying
[2:44:12] nordman8: very passionate Chatting today
[2:44:20] 1_Squeezy: @MacEleven lol ?
[2:44:36] 1_Squeezy: so  you go farrm 10hours for goolds and ui get the same in 1 second
[2:44:36] MacEleven: You can still play the game without buying gold
[2:45:00] 1_Squeezy: yes you can play the game but not really cause yuou cant get your items
[2:45:09] petstorehero: thats just not true at all, most items in BFD even like the good leather agi set pieces sell for like 15-20g commonly
[2:45:11] MacEleven: Yes you can? no one is stopping you
[2:45:18] GODDAN_gdn: i mean u play the game in a guild atm without buying gold?
[2:45:25] MacEleven: Are people on SOD not able to buy anything from the AH?
[2:45:28] xxmagicdoogiexx42069: the chat is on fire today
[2:45:33] petstorehero: Its extremely easy to attend raids get paid and then afford items
[2:45:56] MacEleven: Literally you can make gold sitting in a safe zone right now
[2:45:56] Meachop: GDKP removal =/= stopping botting GDKP removal = More players If they didn't have the numbers to prove it they wouldnt even try. There are people who's only job at blizzard is to maximize profits. They are getting less money because less people want to play. You guys who have stuck through it this far don't realize because the people who didn't are gone
[2:46:07] frostowowo: if the problem is gold buying and gdkp doesnt change it then gdkp isnt a proble
[2:46:16] GODDAN_gdn: idk about other servers but on living flame ms>os or sr is still ALOT more popular than gdkp
[2:46:22] kingslipry: average price of.. comets 150k, dv 250-300k, dbw 500k +
[2:46:28] kingslipry: ye inflation isn't real
[2:46:45] Frothybrew: this is funny
[2:47:10] GODDAN_gdn: i mean wotlk doesnt have any gold sinks, ofc there wil be huge inflation
[2:47:19] ren0: you talking about gdkp items
[2:47:21] ren0: im talking about consumes
[2:47:28] ren0: to play the game costs nothing
[2:47:38] 1_Squeezy: you talking about BIG BELFORT
[2:47:44] ren0: the biggest
[2:47:53] kingslipry: look up price of wild magic on bene
[2:48:02] kingslipry: it's actually 5x still cheap but yea
[2:48:09] ren0: still cheap
[2:48:10] ren0: thanks for confirming
[2:48:16] kingslipry: bots keep it low
