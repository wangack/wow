[2:24:13] 91Niki: @Commander_Eggi Oh nice! Is movement and combat more smooth compared to the first game? I remember it felt a tad clunky in the first game
[2:24:30] mavericks312: The Jedi game just picked a bad time to come out
[2:25:01] freetherocktv: L take
[2:25:09] 91Niki: It came out at a perfect time
[2:25:10] mavericks312: I think there’s more hype for Zelda then the Jedi game
[2:25:14] 91Niki: Right in between major releases
[2:25:15] freetherocktv: nothing
[2:25:19] Mallaes: Dungeon time :P
[2:25:22] EKS90_: @91Niki I really really loved fallen order, so to me it was never "bad" but It feels very similar some combos are still a bit slow, and the dual stuff is a biit wonky in animations. haha.

[2:26:11] 91Niki: @Commander_Eggi Yeah I had nothing bad to say about fallen order, only that movement and combat sometimes felt clunky / laggy. Might have just been the ps4 (playing on ps5) version that I played ijpSHRUG

[2:27:12] EKS90_: @91Niki oh yeah ofc, I play on PC with mouse and keyboard, even tho i play souls and sekiro on controller, just kinda felt ok with MnK ^^, But so far its just fallen order ramped up with tons of more costumization and cool shit

[2:29:26] 91Niki: @mikejensenn24 Gotcha! Yeah a good way to avoid paying full price for a broken AAA game. Which seems to be common these days :p
[2:30:14] 91Niki: Maaan, one game I was excited about was The Last Case of Benedict Fox. Looks like the devs fucked up on that release. Releasing it with weird button mapping AND NO way to remap keys LUL OOF
[2:30:22] abracka_: @mikejensenn24 one of the driving reasons behind me wanting a PS5. every AAA coming out on PC nowadays have so many bugs and game breaking shit
[2:30:42] EKS90_: ALSO, Iam on 1080P, so I imagine people over that will have a worse time LUL
[2:30:42] Vadagar1: So you done with Hardcore for now?
[2:31:01] jarilrpg: @91Niki sloot was playing that last night, looks good other than the button mapping, hopefully they fix that with a patch
[2:31:07] 91Niki: @abracka_ Yep, at least on PS5 you don't have to worry about buggy drivers and such. Plus atm, my ps5 is better than my PC LUL Spec wise
[2:31:28] EKS90_: @91Niki haven' gotten far at all cause im to busy running around but the story seems solid very good intro imo and stuff, :D

[3:29:52] marineboi1288: so in HC you can only do 1 dungeon and then you cant do that dungeon ever again or just for the day?
[3:30:00] 91Niki: @6all One person reporting griefing isn't always gonna do the trick. Blizzard can't just ban everyone who gets 1-2 report for griefing, that's how innocent people get banned. Because some salty people will report others for griefing for just "stealing" one mobs they wanted to attack. It's a slippery slope to get done right
[3:30:04] freetherocktv: @6all take in the satisfaction that the greifers lives are such shit they have "the time" and energy to shit on people all day. Its not a fun life to live at all
[3:30:36] Nerendis: @marineboi1288 1 run total. But you can do every wing if SM

[3:33:58] 91Niki: @Red_Dead_Redeem Yep. I usually just ignore them. Or if they really like to chat me up, I'll just ask them if they're okay, and need somebody to talk to. They don't know how to respond to that LUL
