[1:36:43] rosbaek: @Sinostra better than losing bcells playing meta imo
[1:36:58] rj1izzle5: is demon mode warlock really the best warlock PvP spec?

[2:14:52] Selecktt: Saw your clip dueling the enhance. Not sure why more shamans dont just drop disease cleansing totem. void is like 1k damage that can be negated with 1 gcd
[2:15:12] kult1010: you can do it bryan SeemsGood
[2:15:17] AdamNicholsMusic: as alliance how tf do i track wotf, i cant see when the effect wheres off
[2:15:30] Hydramist: Save on selected AMD Ryzen™ processors only for a limited time! Buy now → https://upu.gg/c/deals/24981496
[2:15:32] DnB_Junkee: runeabilities and their buffs are for some reason temporary buffs. Temporary buffs are things like windfury etc, which cannot be cancelled
[2:15:50] Selecktt: @AdamNicholsMusic You can probably make a weakaura for it pretty easily, even if you cant track the buff itself.
[2:16:17] AdamNicholsMusic: @Selecktt never made a WA before. Ill try.
[2:17:18] tpvmp: How muuch do you think underworld band is worth, they like 500g on my server
[2:17:28] DnB_Junkee: since runeabilities are also not active once the gear turns red, it makes kinda sense to consider them as temp buffs
[2:18:10] DnB_Junkee: castsequence macros with runeabilities are also bugged
[2:18:56] DnB_Junkee: it's just scuffed, because runeabilities are not traditional spells... but who knows what happens under the hood...
[2:19:15] DnB_Junkee: just wild speculation on my side
[2:20:35] polkapolka69: So dramatic
[2:20:40] bodkinz_: amen
[2:21:34] MarmeN28: /removebuff

[2:22:02] Petrkin: @hydramist so fcking true, I started playing war instead and its way more fun even when you lose
[2:22:19] DnB_Junkee: @MarmeN28 that's not a viable command

[2:24:16] DnB_Junkee: so what I have found out with castsequence and runabilities: Once I change my rune, the macro breaks... a /reload fixes it.
[2:24:20] Petrkin: playing priest is so boring at sod
[2:24:20] Selecktt: @AdamNicholsMusic Here. Give this a go. Haven't tested it. but it should work. https://wago.io/6PYab9onQ
[2:24:28] DnB_Junkee: maybe that works for cancelaura as well?
[2:24:37] MarmeN28: /run CancelUnitBuff("player", GetSpellInfo("spellID")) and put spellid from the spell ? no clue if it works tho since i dont play  SOD
[2:24:45] vlogiwow: Fear the hommies
[2:25:14] pw_scyld: Homies are considered undead and thus can't be feared @vlogiwow
[2:25:25] vlogiwow: meh
[2:25:25] pw_scyld: you could shackle one, but that's about it :D
[2:25:32] Skry667: I was goign to suggest Fee Rune Ability
[2:25:36] Selecktt: Group with a shaman and have them stoneclaw totem the homies soniiLUL
[2:25:54] pw_scyld: yes, they are undead
[2:26:05] DnB_Junkee: that macro Marmen wont work... restricted and wont work in combat
[2:26:06] pw_scyld: had a mob in RFK shackle one of mine, that's how I found out
[2:26:32] vlogiwow: So humans have undead hommies?
[2:26:34] DnB_Junkee: wont work, restricted in combat
[2:26:43] MarmeN28: yes it
[2:26:44] MarmeN28: worked

[2:28:23] MarmeN28: you where in combat tho
[2:28:27] MarmeN28: look at the food
[2:28:33] Sinostra: as if priest needed more help
[2:29:07] MarmeN28: maybe this one /run CancelUnitBuff("player", GetSpellInfo("spellID")) the one i linked made your old macro work somehow rofl
[2:29:07] Kameril: !playlist
