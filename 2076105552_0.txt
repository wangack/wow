[1:00:50] Sest49: yes umluft
[1:00:57] Sebleh: yeah umluft sounds right

[1:02:06] Sebleh: isn’t that the same vinegar you use for cleaning?
[1:02:07] Burnprof: them racists
[1:02:08] ursinealli: no
[1:02:09] combobulous: its the basic one...
[1:02:11] ThaSouthstar: no
[1:02:11] skossul: no
[1:02:13] Sebleh: no
[1:02:15] Kahlandra: no not white wine

[1:02:40] krisael: alcohol vinegar?
[1:02:43] skossul: its there
[1:02:46] tnaro: Du kannst Essigessenz mit Wasser mischen, das ist quasi neutraler Essig
[1:02:46] ThaSouthstar: vinaigre blanc
[1:02:51] y0rge: standrat cheapest vinegar
[1:02:51] michaelmm: Basic vinegar is a by product from brewing beer.
[1:03:03] wish2oo0: What's the label say in the vid
[1:03:04] michaelmm: The brown version has added color - it's naturally clear.
[1:03:12] dranthemann: also known as spirit vinegar
[1:03:33] combobulous: distilled "white" vinegar
[1:03:34] Raggu2: ingredients : Vinegar
[1:03:56] Nerraw3: Pure alcohol or spirit vinegar is distilled white vinegar
[1:03:58] Kahlandra: it'll give different flavors
[1:03:59] skossul: it does matter lol
[1:04:06] Raggu2: well, I would assume youd want white (clear) to not taint the color of the fry
[1:04:14] Kahlandra: may react differently in cooking
[1:04:28] skossul: it needs to be white
[1:04:29] Sebleh: I love that because of this mic we can hear her yelling from the kitchen lmao
[1:04:32] michaelmm: Vinegar is basically made from grapes (wine vinegar) or hops and barley (Distilled vinegar).
[1:04:42] skossul: Whine, apple, and other flavors will give it different flavors not needed
[1:04:46] michaelmm: While vinegar is distilled vinegar with no added coloring.
[1:04:46] abusted: You won't taste the Apple in the apple vinegar just use that!
[1:04:49] combobulous: white vinegar is just white wine vinegar
[1:04:52] Sebleh: just different properties when cooking probably Shruge
[1:04:53] combobulous: dont let them fool you
[1:05:01] y0rge: just type einz  vinegar and you will find what you need
[1:05:13] tnaro: you mainly only need the acidity
[1:05:21] NebuFW: classic white vinegar is known and loved by everyone. Made from sun-ripened grain and crystalline water
[1:05:23] skossul: NO, Distilled vinegar is different from White Wine Vinegar
[1:05:24] tnaro: they wont absorb that much taste if you mix it with water
[1:05:49] tetchimon: I watched this video and tried it with apple cider vinegar and it turned out ok. I mean kinda, I burnt it but that was my bad
[1:05:52] Ragnaarockts: google essig and go to wiki
[1:06:00] Ragnaarockts: please
[1:06:12] krisael: I think it can be any white vinegar? We just want the acidity

[1:06:20] RickeG: how important even is this step :O
[1:06:44] Ragnaarockts: Als Lebensmittel wird Essig traditionell durch Fermentation alkoholhaltiger Flüssigkeiten mit Essigsäurebakterien (Essigmutter) hergestellt. Bei diesem Gärungsprozess oxidieren die Bakterien unter Einwirkung von Sauerstoff aus der Luft den Alkohol zu Essig. Die Essigaufbereitung zählt zu den ältesten Lebensmittelherstellungsverfahren der Menschheit.
[1:06:47] ursinealli: Distilled vinegar is going to be more like the vinegar you might clean with
[1:06:49] michaelmm: All vinegar is fundmentally the same thing (Ethanoic acid). The only real difference is how it's made (eg from Wine, Cider or beer).
[1:06:49] NebuFW: you need weed vinager from grane
[1:06:50] tnaro: you can ask chatgpt what would be the equivalent
[1:07:00] Sebleh: “interesting” seblehCope
[1:07:21] saloman8: distilled
[1:07:24] MOGRESS_TV: aceto bianco
[1:07:26] michaelmm: White vinegar is made from grain - it's basically a by product of brewing berr.
[1:07:26] Burnprof: google just told me that "weißer Essig" can be several things, among them "Weißweinessig" or even "Essigessenz"
[1:07:30] y0rge: its just vege vinegar
[1:07:34] NebuFW: no grane/wheed
[1:07:34] Kahlandra: definitely not malt
[1:07:35] Raggu2: White is just the color to represent no color added I assume.
[1:07:46] AskMeIfImBob: just checked my white vinegar, it just says "uncolored alcohol vinegar"
[1:07:50] myguyhood: malt is brown vinegar
[1:07:52] michaelmm: Yes beer or malt vingar is the same as white viegar.
[1:07:53] NebuFW: we got witte azijn in the netherlands witch is the same as white vinegar
[1:08:09] ursinealli: yes
[1:08:10] skossul: Use Surig Essig Essenz
[1:08:13] skossul: that would work

[1:08:18] michaelmm: Brown vinegar is just white vinegar with caramel coploring added to it.
[1:08:30] tnaro: AI says: Understanding White Vinegar  American white vinegar is distilled, meaning it's made from pure grain alcohol. It has a sharp, acidic flavor and typically contains 5% acidity.  German Equivalent  The closest equivalent in Germany is called Branntweinessig or Weingeistessig. This is also a clear, distilled vinegar with a similar acidic bite.
[1:08:42] Kahlandra: who knew i would be trying to explain vinegar at 8:30am while drinking my coffee and avoiding work

[1:09:05] Ragnaarockts: Verdünnter Branntwein ist weingeist :)
[1:09:11] Alassianss: @michaelmm brown vinegar is malting barley
[1:09:25] Ragnaarockts: yeeeeeeeeeeeeees
[1:09:27] Kahlandra: we did it chat
[1:09:59] michaelmm: @Alassianss Yes - malting vinegar is clear (white) the color is always artificial.
[1:10:22] michaelmm: yes all vinegar is clear.

[1:11:01] Raggu2: it looked really thin though. I dont know if thats important.
[1:11:14] Raggu2: Very thin for a slurry
[1:11:21] saloman8: barley gives malt vinegar its brown colour
[1:11:35] yooyoo1337: sweet potatoe taste bad :)

[1:12:31] RickeG: nah sweet potatoes are great, but only a bit of them. Can't eat as many as normal fries from my experience :D You get tired of em
[1:12:45] Alassianss: @michaelmm No if a vinegar is brown means its made of barley starch and doesnt contain acetic acid
[1:12:46] Raggu2: Then throw those away and remake them with real potatoes
[1:12:52] Ragnaarockts: to much work buy a deep fryer is easier :)
[1:12:59] Kahlandra: thats too much work ill just have soggy fries
[1:13:35] Sebleh: shouldn’t it be 3 since marlis doesn’t like sweet potato fries? PepeLaugh
[1:13:37] Zilvaan: Vinegar is just the trivial name for an aqueous solutiuon acetic acid. Which is made by oxidation of alcohol (ethanol). The difference is just in the alcohol which is used in that process. Every part of the world propably uses different alcohols - dependig what is more common/available. Chemically the vinegar is the same, taste and amount of vinegar in the solution (and other contents) can vary.
[1:13:53] saloman8: just buy a bag of frozen ready to cook from the supermarket xD

[1:20:43] Sebleh: Kuroz can we get a sound so she puts it on the screen? naguuraSip
[1:21:05] Sebleh: oh lmao if you’re thinking solar eclipse just wait for the next talent
[1:21:15] Alassianss: we cant see what u looking at :D

[1:22:56] krisael: but why
[1:23:06] MBG_95: bye bye solar eclipse LUL
[1:23:29] Sebleh: I guess the implication is always lunar like S1 of DF by trying to make you use Starfire in ST

[1:24:44] saluda777: sorry step away for a bit
[1:25:04] krisael: its like DF S1
[1:25:08] Sebleh: since it’s not changing starfire to trigger lunar eclipse, you still will go in lunar but also in ST
[1:25:16] legendarism: yep im confused
[1:25:19] Astramoons: it feels like a "punishment" to oveturn the sfire buff which makes no sense
[1:25:34] Astramoons: cause it is still very crappy and only on your primary target
[1:25:36] Sebleh: it’s a choice node at least so you can just not pick it
[1:25:39] itsClubby: the more I see of hero talents the more I wish they were purely cosmetic
[1:25:53] MooniexVibes: @sebleh yeah that was my thought, we just take the other talent

[1:26:19] MBG_95: @itsClubby the initial DF talent trees were like this, there is 10months of reworks to actually make them game ready
[1:26:26] MooniexVibes: which is fine but breaks the point of the class :/
[1:26:34] MooniexVibes: *spec
[1:26:35] Sebleh: and the class trees are still busted two years in @mbg_95
[1:26:52] itsClubby: @MBG_95 bless you for having faith in Blizzard design team Prayge
[1:27:31] Astramoons: probably gets extended by each FoE tick
[1:27:50] Sebleh: I also don’t understand why people want these to be cosmetic. These are a core progression method in the new expac. if they were cosmetic they’d still have to give us something that makes us stronger. Cosmetic only is a “you think you do but you don’t”

[1:31:44] Sebleh: the minor moons just sound like a shooting stars proc but from your moon spells
[1:31:45] Xulu_: minor was capitalised, so I’m guessing they’re not full or half, they’re something different?

[1:32:51] Astramoons: just make FoE or moons heal you while they do dmg like a hot, would be kind of fun
[1:33:11] Sebleh: other specs are getting a lot better defensive hero talents
[1:33:17] combobulous: every other spec should just get bear form too
[1:33:20] Raggu2: Ill never believe a spec that can freely cast heal spells on itself is squishy
[1:33:24] Sebleh: the gap is just growing with moonkin lol
[1:33:51] Astramoons: i played MW monk on fyrakk mythic, and when i went back to my boomie after prog, i felt like i would just die to anything!

[1:34:13] maddershunt: how was the apri ski go was the rain and down hill that bad ?

[1:34:46] TwIBeat: it’s nice for Spitefull I guess?
[1:34:47] Sebleh: i don’t see that talent working everywhere - much like solar beam where it doesn’t always silence after interrupting.

[1:39:40] Sebleh: the ones that say “non arcane” sound like they mean specifically nature damage
[1:39:50] Sebleh: I would say if it says arcane only it includes astral
[1:40:20] Sebleh: yeah
[1:40:20] Astramoons: I am kind of down to play starfire on st, but will make movement intensive fights even more annoying
[1:40:37] Sebleh: just based on phrasing since “non arcane” sounds like specifically “nature only”
[1:40:44] Astramoons: I feel like they would have specified "arcane only" is that were the case
[1:41:16] Sebleh: but if you’re just spamming moons that’s more damage since it’s astral and gets all the arcane damage boosts no?
[1:42:14] Sebleh: they have the talent calculator up for this on Wowhead if you want to mock up a build naguuraSip
[1:42:33] ghostorrca: Science Naguura science
[1:42:36] MBG_95: sunfire
[1:42:37] Raggu2: sunfire
[1:42:41] dovawow: wrath to get into lunar
[1:42:44] MBG_95: wrath to go into lunar?
[1:42:44] Sebleh: sunfire and wrath and mushrooms
[1:42:52] Sebleh: but wrath is only to go into lunar lol
[1:42:59] krisael: I imagine it would buff starfall as well?
[1:43:08] ghostorrca: I took nature damage once :(
[1:43:20] Sebleh: you obvs don’t play mushrooms ijs it also applies
[1:43:42] Astramoons: ss
[1:43:49] Sebleh: yes
[1:43:53] Sebleh: arcane and astral
[1:44:27] rat_starr: But it counts for both regarding modifiers no?
[1:44:29] Sebleh: because they’re using “non arcane” in other talents
[1:44:32] logdrop69: according to max-it is both
[1:44:35] Sebleh: if they’re being inconsistent then they’re stupid
[1:44:47] Astramoons: every time so far in this expansion they say "arcane" or "nature" it always affects astral. So if they didnt want it  to say astral they would say it explicitely i believe
[1:44:47] MBG_95: I would only say it does include because of other talents that are similar which do include
[1:45:03] Sebleh: but IMO them using “non arcane” in some talents means that “arcane” is “arcane and astral”
[1:45:07] horakk8: Hey
[1:45:10] Dragaar13: the fact that there is some doubt in the way the phrasing is interpreted doesn't seem like a good thing - should be more specific or simpler
[1:45:12] vharakh_17: call a dev for clarification YEP
[1:45:20] vharakh_17: cause we cant just always assume
[1:45:41] Sebleh: that type of buff usually only applies to something you cast manually
[1:45:46] Sebleh: so I would say a proc doesn’t consume it
[1:45:47] myguyhood: it says the spell YOU use not the ones u proc
[1:45:49] Astramoons: @Sebleh true
[1:45:51] Raggu2: Dmg bonus seems too small to worry about tbh
[1:45:59] Mr_Kamex: doubt it, that would just be counterintuitive. But then again they gave rogues using a defensive for damage, so eeeh
[1:46:00] Dragaar13: doesn't Naguura have Ion's number?  It's early, but I bet he'd take your call, right? :P

[1:46:22] Sebleh: oh fair
[1:46:39] vharakh_17: so your just buffing an arcane mage NOTESD
[1:46:39] Aegatron: tjenare Caro
[1:46:47] Sebleh: I still don’t think it would be applied to a random proc. lmao imagine you get the buff and it buffs a moonfire tick PepeLaugh

[1:47:24] Sebleh: i need an emote for sarcasm font naguuraWeirdChamp
[1:47:59] Raggu2: I would assume its optimal use is fury of elune since the whole tree revolves around it and that its increase snapshots for the entire dot
[1:48:00] Sebleh: I just think it would be a huge mistake to have it buff procs tbh naguuraSip

[1:49:14] vharakh_17: do both get applied or is just one is for feral in the node and 1 is for resto in the node? like is the sunfire/moonfire only applied to resto and not the other one?
[1:50:39] Dragaar13: seems good for arena?
[1:50:51] Raggu2: They just fixed this with arms warrior and ip. Why would they just do it again
[1:50:54] chasechristiannikole1023: Hey
[1:52:45] chasechristiannikole1023: How are you today
[1:52:55] Dragaar13: this entire tree seems like a lot of passive healing
[1:53:06] crooked_paw: did we look at the guardian/balance tree?
[1:53:08] Astramoons: i feel like it is "aight" minimal impact but kind of okay compared to others
[1:53:20] Astramoons: would rather have this than some of the freak "treant boomie" ones we got!
[1:53:29] Kuroz: she looked at the balance one before
[1:53:40] crooked_paw: cool ty
[1:56:25] chie117: they should make wow simple again for new and old players i dont know why they cant see it this is the resone why classic is better then retail wow

[1:58:38] velocidade6: Was really hoping the hero talents would offer a ravenous frenzy style ability again xD
[1:58:57] velocidade6: I LOVED it
[1:59:02] velocidade6: noooo
[1:59:03] kiidaa93: soon classic will catch us all. its a normal process of becoming a gamerdad or mum. as soon as we become too bad for retail
[1:59:18] Pilha390: what is ravenous frenzy?
[1:59:24] Burnprof: let's just hope for convoke's comeback

[2:00:09] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[2:00:19] Dragaar13: hahaha he'll never know! LUL
[2:01:02] velocidade6: Idk Ravenous added some complexity, I love the concept of boomy, but find DF a lil dry
[2:01:43] srbadin: classic is for sure bad thing for retail couse player focus and dev focus shifts to it a lot so instead getting new stuff on retail they can just polish and rework old content, good thing for blizz pocket for sure
[2:01:44] imthabeast: im about to pug a +11 WCM on my 446 ret pally. that's compareable to your 28 key right? (also im on NA)
[2:03:09] srbadin: @imthabeast no if you do 20 then you compare
[2:03:26] Sebleh: naguura you’re being too negative. doing damage for 30 seconds every 3 minutes as a Venthyr Moonkin was the peak wow experience (this is sarcasm)
[2:03:57] imthabeast: @srbadin i dont think imma be able to do that on my 446 pally lol
[2:04:21] imthabeast: I'm a mage!
[2:04:59] Kuroz: hello @tam1h
[2:05:06] velocidade6: I've just returned after a long break, did they remove the shapeshift for root? (Just felt the ghost wolf change)
[2:05:06] Kuroz: CatDriving
[2:05:09] Dragaar13: mages are kind of broken... again
[2:05:33] Sebleh: not for the tree boss here
[2:05:52] velocidade6: I couldn't on shammy :/ guess druid kept it
[2:05:55] Sebleh: they removed it for the tree boss in waycrest @velocidade6 but you can still shapeshift out of roots anywhere else

[2:06:26] bootycheeker: never
[2:06:28] velocidade6: Thorns not root sorry
[2:06:47] Sebleh: the dumbest fucking mechanic this season tbh
[2:06:50] velocidade6: They love mages
[2:06:50] robdruidx: its a stun not a root
[2:06:51] Sebleh: it’s so fucking stupid
[2:06:58] Sebleh: it literally fucking ruins this entire dungeon
[2:07:01] robdruidx: so they can only blink if they DONT take shimmer
[2:07:02] imthabeast: blink goes out of everything. I don't think shimmer works.
[2:07:10] Sebleh: I’m getting Angy I can’t think about that mechanic
[2:07:13] JakeTehBear: mage main character of wow xdd
[2:07:17] Dragaar13: it's a pvp thing, the break stuns thing, but they could change the boss mechanic to not work in that scenario
[2:07:18] feetlicker59: blink has always gotten you out of stuns why wouldnt it for that lol
[2:07:34] Skelleton88: why dumb? just play 3 mages and everything is fine
[2:07:44] velocidade6: But you can't see the thorn target? that's the issue right
[2:07:46] imthabeast: but if you read blink it should clearly get out of it lol
[2:07:55] velocidade6: Can't even defensive it in advance without a guess
[2:08:08] robdruidx: yeah it should at LEAST give you a heads up who its going on

[3:54:15] Xevenna: But that’s their thing the one I remember specifically was all about foraging and using what they could from the land.

[4:46:42] Jerrod_Druid: The higher you go in europe, the taller they get
[4:46:44] Aladeri: towards the equator = smaller people, so the cold generates height while heat makes people short?
[4:46:45] schdormy: the north, but that's where you are and you are tiny?
[4:46:46] Fallen_o7: im 195 cm

[4:48:04] papafigs84: i have a lot of italians firends most are shorter
[4:48:10] Killfill_: When i visitied north italy few years back before covid, they didnt seem that short, was worse when we got down around Venice. But thats from Northern europe POV :p
[4:48:13] Sebleh: yeah naguura is tiny @marbared
[4:48:13] JohnnyOneLung: they need to be tall to harvest the pasta from the trees

[4:48:27] TiwazFo5: =Short AF lol
[4:48:39] Philaeux: the wikipedia page is good
[4:48:40] itsClubby: googling average height in europe will be really skewed because the dutch will drag the average up very high PepeLaugh
[4:48:41] Philaeux: yeah this one
[4:48:45] Sebleh: average height in my country is 5’5” so I’m tall for my country but not where I live seblehDepresso
[4:48:55] tebak_: south of italy should be smaller
[4:48:59] G0thM0G13: can you check for croatia?
[4:49:01] schdormy: @Naguura be carefull, some of those stats are self-reported and .... somehow always taller then the officially measured stats
[4:49:06] Yoshli: Tallguru
[4:49:09] Jerrod_Druid: Netherlands are probably the tallest
[4:49:19] tebak_: I mean in north we are taller than south of italians
[4:49:35] itsClubby: lol giants
[4:49:38] Raggu2: Nordic giants
[4:49:49] Killfill_: @Jerrod_Druid They was atleast, if not still tallest. But most of Northern Europe within 1-2 cm anyways
[4:50:01] elindigente03: dont look at  latam average
[4:50:02] JohnnyOneLung: did I ever show you that news report btw?
[4:50:33] JohnnyOneLung: one year for aprils fools the bbc, like decades ago, reported on the "Pasta crop" that year
[4:50:50] Jerrod_Druid: Still surprises me, thought the Dutch people where giants, and I'm taller then their average, guess I'm decent sized after all
[4:51:19] lanta404: larger bodies are better adapted to cold weather and vice versa for smaller/warm
[4:51:38] TotallyNotRaien: wouldnt it be the opposite?
[4:51:39] Sebleh: it’s totally true (anecdotally)
[4:51:41] JohnnyOneLung: I put the video in our DMs if you wanna see it sometime
[4:51:58] JohnnyOneLung: to fight the polar bears
[4:52:00] schdormy: ratio Body surface/mass
[4:52:03] badactionhiro: has to be diet and wealth
[4:52:07] sasulnik6: HS
[4:52:09] Vertrose10: Eskimos are not tall tho ahah
[4:52:10] TotallyNotRaien: smaller bodies would generate more hate, and taller bodies have an easier time expelling heat because of the larger body surface area
[4:52:22] JohnnyOneLung: OH
[4:52:27] lanta404: yeah its about body mass and the physics of heat retention and body temperature maintenance
[4:52:30] schdormy: but in Europe there is a socioeconomic component for sure
[4:52:30] JohnnyOneLung: have you seen the new season of True Dectective?
[4:52:39] Sinrath: Bergmann's rule
[4:52:44] marbared: diet and wealth. yep, that
[4:52:51] Raggu2: Brainpower. what a blast.

They had a verbal agreement with a scout.  He said they'd phone them by 9 the next day to confirm.  They didn't factor in timezones. He already signed to another club before they rang at 10.

[5:19:34] Sebleh: the lasagna you had in Sweden looked great tho Kappa
[5:19:46] TiwazFo5: odds they make the timer?
[5:20:40] TypicalxLlama: lasagna is terrible always

[5:21:46] procotwitch: pizza > lasagna
[5:21:50] Sebleh: @fronkacean like when she complained about “how do you fuck up making bread by not putting salt in it” and just guess what happened when she made bread
[5:21:50] estimat9: I kinda miss retail and the mythic+.. I’ve just been away for so long that everything seems so confusing now 😂
[5:22:09] Aladeri: have you had lasagna soup before? very yummy

[5:22:40] justkayster: Essentially what you describbed
[5:22:43] TiwazFo5: sounds close to a pot pie
[5:22:53] TypicalxLlama: its a thing
[5:22:54] justkayster: Hahaha, as an American, probably.
[5:22:57] fronkacean: naguura proving she is italian by being an elitist on food
[5:22:59] TypicalxLlama: <not american, canadian
[5:23:07] NicklasJ92: maybe you just ordered wrong in Austria, and actually had lasagna soup? Hmm
[5:23:10] justkayster: But, it is good.
[5:23:19] TiwazFo5: thick flat noodles in a soup is similar to my moms chicken pot pie... german style
[5:23:40] Aladeri: haha Americans probably just made it up yes, imagine chili without beans etc but with more cheese and lasagna noodles
[5:24:13] Kuroz: it's tomato soup with meat and pasta
[5:24:17] justkayster: Well, there are little flat noodles too.
[5:24:34] justkayster: Mmmm, we dont make it with tomato soup hahaha
[5:24:39] tebak_: what is wrong with you people

[5:24:56] dranonymous: Hey Caro how you doin ?
[5:25:00] Sebleh: it’s not bolognese sauce it’s bolognese broth Kappa
[5:25:08] NicklasJ92: we take a lasagna, and we just blend it to a thin soup - that is the way
[5:25:34] Sebleh: soup is tipi topi
[5:25:49] Sebleh: you should make soup for your Friday dinner
[5:25:50] TiwazFo5: restaurant soup can tend to be very salty
