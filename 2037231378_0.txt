[0:27:19] minorheadlines: that is amazingly rediculous
[0:27:37] RosieSeren: Good afternoon tali!
[0:27:52] Nulgar: You would save a lot of ink by getting the naked Penrin, just outline it frogmu1Hehe
[0:28:02] ebrahim_91: Tali can we not pick the PP option tho :(
[0:28:06] thunduz: you made a good choice in ordering that T&E sweater. so comfy
[0:28:10] ebrahim_91: If I could vote I'd vote against it LOL
[0:28:10] Atomicpanda: a friday stream on a monday? what? tneDorkthyr
[0:28:11] minorheadlines: on your but obviously
[0:28:14] Singhy: on the cheeks
[0:28:20] ebrahim_91: and yet I gifted subs ahaha
[0:28:48] thunduz: W's all around
[0:28:52] Atomicpanda: tali, the only option is to tattoo him on your abdomen so your willy would be his willy.
[0:28:55] Singhy: double win
[0:29:01] Grainhouse: lower back
[0:29:03] aeson_of_raid_sock: on the forearm so you can make him dance
[0:29:05] C_Murdurr: @TaliesinAndEvitel would you say this game is pretty fucking good?
[0:29:19] SunnyAutumns: on the face
[0:29:25] thunduz: you have to put it in a very obvious spot so evitel has to see it at all times
[0:29:25] SunnyAutumns: to see in the mirror
[0:29:26] Singhy: on the tip of
[0:29:27] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel your much braver then I could ever be.
[0:29:34] persona_ghostwalker: Did you already do the Gilneas quests? Did I miss it?
[0:29:35] chief_hakoda_91: BG3 was fantastic
[0:29:42] witchhobbit: it's the right opinion
[0:29:44] JoeTheRedcoat: I think that's a lot of people's opinions to be fair
[0:29:51] TristanRur: *** But what about your 25 top games? :) :)
[0:30:05] witchhobbit: hav you guys done another playthrough?
[0:30:14] TristanRur: Would love to see you make a list one of these days
[0:30:26] minorheadlines: guesses for BG3 DLC?
[0:30:33] Singhy: “have you got fifa 10 mate?”
[0:30:39] thunduz: Fifa is fun times not gonna lie
[0:30:39] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel PERSONAL OPINION: I think that it is a tad bit insulting that the forsaken had to be involved in the Gilneas questline... Because that makes it feel as if the Gilnean's aren't allowed to retake it by their own... but need to be ALLOWED to get the land from the people that actively prevented them from being there in the first place. Just saying, feels a bit shite.
[0:30:41] TristanRur: Certified Brit
[0:30:42] thunduz: Elden Ring
[0:30:58] thunduz: oops
[0:31:00] JoeTheRedcoat: Shadowrun like the SNES one?
[0:31:02] witchhobbit: do you like the witcher?
[0:31:10] Atomicpanda: pong
[0:31:14] thunduz: dig dug
[0:31:22] mydemoncat: unironically maybe burning crusade or wrath?
[0:31:28] hectorian01: Good evening kings and queens
[0:31:29] witchhobbit: actually better question, did you ever get into the dragon age games?
[0:31:30] databob1: snes shaldowrun was fun
[0:31:31] Singhy: ocarina of time
[0:31:31] Valestrus: Crash Bandicoot
[0:31:37] JoeTheRedcoat: Did you play any of the newer Shadowrun CRPGs?
[0:31:46] SunnyAutumns: Starfield! Skyrim! Skyrim Platinum edition! Skyrim for PS4! Skyrim GOTY Edition. Skyrim Remastered! Skyrim Complete Edition. Skyrim for XBox One. Skyrim Anniversary edition.
[0:31:49] thunduz: lol I just had mrz try out golden eye for the first time and it was not for her lol
[0:32:01] Atomicpanda: Polybius
[0:32:16] aeson_of_raid_sock: Battletoads

[0:32:31] thunduz: 100%
[0:32:40] databob1: my wide is obsessed with golden eye
[0:32:42] Elrathir: I don't play those other nerd games, I only play cool games for cool people, like world of warcraft
[0:32:53] HolocronCoder: That slightly weird setup of the gun moves separately from the character, causing a lot of gun-leading
[0:32:57] minorheadlines: haha Goldeneye only with the Big Head mod
[0:32:58] Midgens_: really anyone that did not play it as a kid is going to like it
[0:33:05] Atomicpanda: wipeout xl
[0:33:07] Midgens_: or not going to like it I mean
[0:33:12] TristanRur: I generally try to include games on my list that I would still love to this day
[0:33:15] JoeTheRedcoat: How about Perfect Dark?
[0:33:25] databob1: shit my wife....that slip would get me assaulted
[0:33:25] hketernal: Goldeneye works well on my Switch after I watched a guide on how to change the control settings. I did love Goldeneye as a kid though.
[0:33:27] thunduz: Mortal Kombat
[0:33:29] thunduz: ?
[0:33:37] Atomicpanda: the original dungeon keeper
[0:33:57] SunnyAutumns: New Vegas
[0:34:00] thunduz: I think we hit top 50 at this point
[0:34:02] Valinor55: Chrono Trigger
[0:34:02] SunnyAutumns: Undertale
[0:34:05] Atomicpanda: oids
[0:34:05] GameingAspect: final fansty cristal croncles is a banger
[0:34:15] databob1: and earthbound
[0:34:24] HolocronCoder: Mario 64 was amazing in the time
[0:34:35] kiewies: Krissel Kronkles
[0:34:45] Atomicpanda: super puzzle fighter 2 turbo
[0:34:48] Elrathir: any final fantasies? perhaps the fourteenth one of them?
[0:34:56] atamala: my wife played mario 64 last year for the first time and it does hold up well
[0:35:03] databob1: earthbound can be an acquired taste
[0:35:16] Atomicpanda: diablo 2
[0:35:16] VoidPoet: @taliesinandevitel had a chance to do the Outland races yet? would love to hear your thoughts!
[0:35:40] databob1: ff4 and ff6 are my favorites
[0:35:43] Atomicpanda: E.T.
[0:35:45] Elrathir: true enough
[0:35:47] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel PERSONAL OPINION: I think that it is a tad bit insulting that the forsaken had to be involved in the Gilneas questline... Because that makes it feel as if the Gilnean's aren't allowed to retake it by their own... but need to be ALLOWED to get the land from the people that actively prevented them from being there in the first place. Just saying, feels a bit shite.
[0:35:56] AlanC2024: outland races were good
[0:36:10] TenWin: The auchindoun one was TERRIBLE... Like jesus it felt like you could not get any momentum.
[0:36:14] urbenjames: i cant get gold on the advance course XD
[0:36:19] AlanC2024: my favorite was the netherstorm biomes :D
[0:36:23] kiewies: Does Myffanwy have an RP backstory?
[0:36:27] influx_404_: You can DIG
[0:36:31] DiscordianKitty: i did them all in one go as well, really enjoyed
[0:36:36] influx_404_: Diggy diggy
[0:36:37] Sindorein1124: People don't know the skyward ascent trick
[0:36:42] Atomicpanda: oh, right! there's new races. i should do that. though I still need to get to the archives.
[0:36:53] Valestrus: @TaliesinAndEvitel  - sorry for changing the subject. The new chronicle book is ready for pre-order. What do you reckon - worth buying, now that chronicle is essentially the titans' point of view of the lore?
[0:37:00] VoidPoet: I did them all yesterday morning, struggled a bit w the netherstorm ones cause they’re soooo long
[0:37:00] witchhobbit: @kiewies i would love to know that too
[0:37:41] databob1: I wasn't even trying to get gold I only needed bronze on all the races and all the types to get the stuff I wanted
[0:37:47] placeholdername33: what's the "flick trick"?
[0:37:48] NotIeni: Im so bad at dragon racing, i sont think i can get even silver advanced anymore
[0:37:51] AlanC2024: I went to karazhan today from stormwind for mount farming. the world flying is so good now!
[0:38:18] atamala: shes a xalatath simp
[0:38:31] witchhobbit: absolutely
[0:38:37] witchhobbit: who isn't
[0:38:55] Atomicpanda: can you show the flip trick on twitch?
[0:39:01] VzualLeader: !wa
[0:39:03] VzualLeader: lol
[0:39:15] Atomicpanda: oh that flick trick
[0:39:22] Vaephera: The dragon rider addon is great. I've tried others in the past and for whatever reason they never actually hd an accurate speed. Having one that works made me absurdly good at the flick, cause it actually gives good feedback
[0:39:33] AlanC2024: I have it. I like the new change that fades it out when you land
[0:39:34] Midgens_: who is the author?
[0:40:01] Atomicpanda: i don't want to understand flying. i just want to complain about it.
[0:40:15] Rico_Azzarash: Hewwo Tali! Hewwo chat! Hope yall doing great today! < 3
[0:40:34] kiewies: Lo/
[0:40:34] Rico_Azzarash: Rico_Azzarash is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 1480 in the channel! 
[0:40:35] Rico_Azzarash: Rico_Azzarash gifted a Tier 1 sub to Rooklington! 
[0:40:37] MrScotticus: Addon is "Dragon Rider" by keyboardturner
[0:40:41] kiewies: o/*
[0:40:44] Rico_Azzarash: A friendly bump from wild Rico xD
[0:41:06] databob1: cleaver
[0:41:21] butlerlog: it is way faster but also a bit inprecise so it can be hard in races
[0:41:31] Atomicpanda: degenerative game play.
[0:41:37] Arlaeya: harder to do for those close to the ground races
[0:41:48] AlanC2024: Have you been flying much in the old world? It's so good but at the same time so wierd :D
[0:42:37] butlerlog: oh nice i didnt think to combine the two i've always just been flicking
[0:42:48] thunduz: sounds very technical to me lol
[0:42:54] butlerlog: if that isnt tmi lmao
[0:43:03] influx_404_: You can use Surge Forward to make quick turns in corners
[0:43:17] jaedd3680: jaedd3680 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! Happy Friday! So lovely to wake up with a Tali stream this morning!
[0:43:28] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel did you see that blizz is selling last years lunar new year classic pet on retail this year
[0:43:30] xander_t21: xander_t21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! tneMovEEE DinoDance tneMovEEE DinoDance tneMovEEE
[0:43:32] thunduz: this is why I am a scrub mrgmHehe I don't get this stuff
[0:43:51] butlerlog: that is also a weakaura but this addon does look way cooler visually
[0:44:14] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel did yall see the "stay and listen" from kalec on the seat of the aspects?
[0:44:20] thunduz: ok do it again but like you're explaining to a 5 year old
[0:44:23] minorheadlines: just came back - whats this addon?
[0:44:25] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel PERSONAL OPINION: I think that it is a tad bit insulting that the forsaken had to be involved in the Gilneas questline... Because that makes it feel as if the Gilnean's aren't allowed to retake it by their own... but need to be ALLOWED to get the land from the people that actively prevented them from being there in the first place. Just saying, feels a bit shite.
[0:44:28] AlanC2024: it even fades after a while while stationary
[0:44:30] Kalla_Dragoone: Why does the WoW community always feel the need to try and max out everyone’s single thing in the game? the flick trick looks interesting and must work, but like…why? Were already going fucking fast lol 😂
[0:44:32] shylareth: LOVE the karlach approves alert!
[0:44:32] butlerlog: yeah i like that it looks like wow UI and dragonflight style
[0:44:55] Atomicpanda: seems like gaming mechanics like this shouldn't be required to get gold. feels like a bug they just couldn't be bothered to fix so they designed races for it.
[0:44:56] kiewies: I love waking up to a Tali & Evi stream
[0:45:44] thunduz: I am just so distracted at that mount, looks so cool!
[0:45:47] jaedd3680: @kiewies its the best! Always a great start to a day
[0:46:04] butlerlog: vibes are important
[0:46:08] realGameTheory: Clap
[0:46:08] Saiyori: at last!
[0:46:09] cabeshpash: was anyone else disappointed by the gilneas quest line?
[0:46:12] thunduz: victory!!! they didn't forget about you!
[0:46:13] Arlaeya: broccoli dragon!!! hurray!
[0:46:15] AlanC2024: its cool :D
[0:46:20] Singhy: woo! congrats!!
[0:46:21] butlerlog: hurray
[0:46:22] Rico_Azzarash: Someone from blizzard did watch weekly reset? XD
[0:46:27] jaedd3680: tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes
[0:46:29] kaijoe_: My pandaren loves it
[0:46:34] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel did yall see the "stay and listen" from kalec on the seat of the aspects?
[0:46:40] witchhobbit: @cabeshpash i always want these questlines to last longer
[0:46:46] Atomicpanda: tree dragon is nice but the wings creep me out
[0:46:53] butlerlog: love the slitherdrake model and animations, best of them all
[0:46:57] neverbornlucky: whoever designed the tree dragon needs to be slapped in the face
[0:47:09] cabeshpash: @haleych yeah I did it in under 10 minutes, didn't really feel like an earned victory or hard fought battle
[0:47:31] Arlaeya: I've taken so many screenshots there
[0:47:36] LilyOfTremere: Wasn't the flying addon called Dragonrider? :o
[0:47:38] thunduz: Did blizz finally make doing holiday events worth doing with the dragon mount customizations? The lunar new year one looks dope
[0:47:39] AlanC2024: amirdrassil also looks nice at this time of day
[0:47:40] GameingAspect: wasent there ment to be a toy tht changed the skybox at begining of the expansion
[0:47:51] CeasiusPls: that tree pop in is a bit jarring, will probably be made permanent though
[0:47:53] DiscordianKitty: such a brave take
[0:47:55] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[0:47:58] shylareth: @GameingAspect whooaaaa hiiii
[0:47:58] FelPlague: Hottake
[0:48:01] whisperlude: lmao WHAT A TAKE
[0:48:04] realGameTheory: one of the expansions of all time
[0:48:07] Nulgar: Certainly in the Top 10 of Expansions tneEvi
[0:48:09] cabeshpash: all of the people shitting on retail right now are gonna be playing when classic wow dragon flight is released lol
[0:48:11] The_Action_Man: Dragonflight is DEFINITELY one of the WoW expansions barbToxic
[0:48:12] GameingAspect: @GameingAspect hi new phone who dis
[0:48:13] thunduz: mrgmDab mrgmDab mrgmDab mrgmKEKW
[0:48:16] FelPlague: with the wow communities hatred of wow, it actually prob is a hottake
[0:48:21] MatMatsuda: dragonflight is certainly an expansion
[0:48:27] sirhc_knil: I immediately reported the tweet to scotland yard. How DARe he
[0:48:35] databob1: flying into the Ardenwield zone is one of my favorite flights
[0:48:36] Atomicpanda: "dragonflght will absolutely be remembered as one of the world of warcraft expansions."
[0:48:36] cabeshpash: lmao
[0:48:47] influx_404_: Forced labor
[0:48:49] cabeshpash: the digs are a cluster fuck
[0:48:56] MyOpiate: Yo!  Happy Friday!!
[0:49:04] cabeshpash: yeah azure span is like grizzly hills 2.0
[0:49:18] Mazerbeam: You only have to do them once a week and can only do it on a single character. I can deal with the cluster for for a few min
[0:49:22] cabeshpash: total fan service zone, which I appreciate
[0:49:26] aerissune: Love Azure Span
[0:49:27] GameingAspect: azure span musiccccccccc
[0:49:30] Singhy: remember the firelands daily area? can’t be shitter than that surely
[0:49:37] AlanC2024: I think in general the music has been great
[0:49:39] VoidPoet: I think a lot of people still don’t understand that you can dig while you wait for a job
[0:49:40] NorieNerd: i want dynamic flying on all mounts now!
[0:49:54] cabeshpash: dragon flying just makes the core gameplay loop so much more fun
[0:50:09] cabeshpash: 100%
[0:50:15] Arlaeya: I'm totally planning on touring the Dragon Isles on a ground mount before WW launches as a kind of... last visit for a bit and just admiring the effort they put into the views
[0:50:26] influx_404_: You can always knock people off in warlords if you want "interaction"
[0:50:35] kiewies: I think because dragon flying makes you interact with the landscape more and landmarks more than swimflying
[0:50:37] Sorin__: Sorin__ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[0:50:40] Atomicpanda: how does this not have a no mount zone?
[0:50:58] witchhobbit: did you ever main something before priest?
[0:51:03] AlanC2024: the changes in speed while dragonriding is what makes it more social i think

[0:52:30] cabeshpash: I appreciate this channel
[0:52:31] kiewies: Eeeeeee
[0:52:36] Synkronos: They are at least sharding the zone pretty aggressively. I've been trying to get the Tuskarr fishing items out of the way by farming the ice holes, and I constantly get sharded half way through a pool
[0:52:41] cabeshpash: I just did it for the tat TBH
[0:52:42] SikEo_88: i played loads in season 1, got burnt out and stopped playing, now i wanna come back into the game with teh new content but i have no idea where to start
[0:52:55] SikEo_88: the amount of quests avaiable is insane, and ive no idea what order to do them
[0:52:59] Rico_Azzarash: buTT xD
[0:53:01] SikEo_88: proper lost
[0:53:15] witchhobbit: i chose a hunter in BC because i liked archery. usually like a ranger in games. now hunter is one of my least fav classes lol

[0:53:51] witchhobbit: yeah it is pretty bad
[0:53:52] Nulgar: Corgo100 hint for these diggings with lots of people around: bind a key for "Interact With Mouseover", this ignores players
[0:53:52] cabeshpash: ya the campaign quests are totally unordered for new players
[0:53:58] thunduz: Tali are you going to get the lunar new year dragon mount armor?
[0:54:01] MyOpiate: i dig it

[0:54:21] thunduz: I have no idea, thought you could tell me lol
[0:54:50] Synkronos: You can also just right click on the progress bar, don't need to click on the actual dirt pile
[0:54:55] witchhobbit: going on alts in dragonflight is like being a new player or like someone who hasn't played in a while with how those quests are
[0:54:56] cabeshpash: dragon flight is the best thing since wrath hands down
[0:54:56] Sorin__: better than what I guess
[0:55:02] PidiaP: It is actually my birthday today so how did Tali know tneKhadgarWut
[0:55:07] SunnyAutumns: I think Dragonflight will be remembered as one of the WoW expansions
[0:55:17] Garysteel1984: Hey Tali, hope you've had a good week. Glad to see you bossing M+ this season!
[0:55:22] neverbornlucky: shadow lands best wow expansion EVER
[0:55:25] cabeshpash: it's just trendy to shit on retail rn
[0:55:31] thunduz: we got so much new stuff this expansion! Literally game changing updates
[0:55:39] GameingAspect: you will fly thou azure span you will weep
[0:55:53] MyOpiate: they are going directly from Cata classic to Dragonflight classic
[0:56:01] Rico_Azzarash: It feels like whoever gets this digging jobs they are not doing it :C
[0:56:02] Tegger37: I love BfA.  Boralus?!  C'mon, the music, the size, the look
[0:56:03] SikEo_88: telling me i will weep sounds vaguely threatening lol
[0:56:09] JoeTheRedcoat: Like how whenever Estinien comes on screen they play the HW motif and I tear up a little.
[0:56:11] SikEo_88: you WILL weep
[0:56:16] DozlaT: even just the qol stuff is insane to think about. Wasn't the ui update in dragonflight?
[0:56:22] witchhobbit: yes i agree, i think the issues that dragonflight does have are so strong because there is not that many issues or things to complain about imo
[0:56:31] thordallim: hope you dont have to do a raid to continue the basic campaign though
[0:56:47] Saiyori: this is my fave expac since mop
[0:57:17] cabeshpash: the Tyr Question is really good so far
[0:57:20] Dangeons_and_Dragons: WoW Players hate every expac until the next expac and then are like..."it wasnt bad!" lol
[0:57:22] witchhobbit: @DozlaT yup!!!
[0:57:24] realGameTheory: FeelsStrongMan
[0:57:28] cabeshpash: Tyr quest line*
[0:57:52] witchhobbit: @Dangeons_and_Dragons very true lol
[0:57:53] cabeshpash: @Dangeons_and_Dragons this is so true
[0:57:53] OmgItsEdizzle: NOTHING beats Boralus theme music
[0:57:55] SikEo_88: i wish raszageth didnt die so early, biggest own goal in DF i reckon
[0:57:55] thordallim: people play with the music on ??
[0:57:56] Saumur: I listened to a few of your BfA videos a couple of days ago - The 8.1 Boralus Music? Gosh, love it. That's what I want for Dragonflight in a few years :D
[0:58:03] funviking99: LUL
[0:58:23] OmgItsEdizzle: LOOOOVED it
[0:58:27] Sorin__: the "da da da, da da da" is such a fun little riff
[0:58:30] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[0:58:32] JarJar_Brinkz: DinoDance
[0:58:36] OmgItsEdizzle: Into my veins
[0:58:36] WowiDan: does he already give u the tasks?
[0:58:45] thunduz: for me personally the tone of DF was set with that cinematic and the naming of Stony Tony tneStonyTony
[0:58:52] databob1: I'm thinking of theming my phone to dragonflight
[0:58:56] witchhobbit: lol i loved the boralus music but yeah wish there was a chill inn music track
[0:58:57] cabeshpash: stony Tony lol
[0:58:58] WowiDan: damn XD
[0:58:58] AlanC2024: hey tali I just did 2 reverse challenge race on gold for the first time by using your skyward ascent tip :D
[0:59:18] DiscordianKitty: yeah, it was a lot more fun on the ptr
[0:59:25] DarthTaz0: the NA digs haven't been this crowded since Tuesday lol. I get  a bunch of tasks
[0:59:27] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to AlanC2023!

[0:59:43] Rico_Azzarash: Now Tali give us a master class on explaining that digging quests in Arvavist floating island!
[0:59:44] Kwynzie: what was the tip?

[1:00:01] Kwynzie: ok
[1:00:03] Singhy: the tip is where he’s getting the tattoo
[1:00:10] Rico_Azzarash: *arcavist or something
[1:00:14] Rico_Azzarash: My english is bad xD

[1:00:37] MichaelXIII: Did you see the Gilneas transmog now has poofy sleeves?
[1:00:38] hectorian01: what was the tip again? :))
[1:00:47] DiscordianKitty: I much prefer the qwuestline
[1:00:55] cabeshpash: any predictations about what the war within story will be about @TaliesinAndEvitel ?
[1:01:31] AlanC2024: Thanks @thunduz for the sub :D
[1:01:46] diarrhea_lad: @cabeshpash Remember the movie Osmosis Jones? It'll be kinda like that.
[1:01:48] DarthTaz0: more currency, not sure about rep. you turn it in by the vendor
[1:01:51] Vaephera: You've got to turn it in at the academy version of him
[1:01:57] cabeshpash: @diarrhea_lad never seen it lol
[1:02:04] HolocronCoder: That's the home base for the archives
[1:02:19] OmgItsEdizzle: Very excited for TWW... have a suspicion we're going back to BFA levels of storytelling. Really hyped to be way more engaged in the story again.
[1:02:21] WowiDan: whats that bagg add on?
[1:02:24] RosieSeren: I haven't had any transmog drops at all yet, and my partner got 2 in their first one
[1:02:34] cabeshpash: I just want more of the old gods / black empire
[1:02:37] Rico_Azzarash: adibags
[1:02:39] diarrhea_lad: def not Bagnon
[1:02:40] adleydarling: adibags OP
[1:02:43] WowiDan: ty ty
[1:02:43] butlerlog: i use adibags its fantastic
[1:03:24] butlerlog: i'll say this for dragonflight, AFKing in the capital has never been so good
[1:03:36] butlerlog: i love flying under all the valdrakken bridges
[1:03:50] OmgItsEdizzle: Warlock got full t4 Voidheart Tmog ready to swear fealty void mommy Xal'atath
[1:04:01] DiscordianKitty: Valdrakken was my favourite capital
[1:04:06] AlanC2024: and doing DR in the old world is so great. I look forward to dynamic flying :D
[1:04:25] Vaephera: First rep level gives nothing
[1:04:29] Vaephera: Dunno about the rest
[1:04:33] the_howlermonkey: Lets all praise Danuser for his work on this xpac!
[1:04:34] Vaephera: There is an achievement for maxing it
[1:04:37] cabeshpash: lol
[1:04:46] Arlaeya: I hope it's not you get a book with all your finds for your inventory to carry with all the other books.........
[1:04:53] butlerlog: like in the first trailer for dragonflight we saw where the dragons swooping around, thats me brain AFK in valdrakken, which is way better than running rings around oribos airport
[1:04:59] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[1:05:15] bucephalos: Do you think we will get "better" zone events in war within?
[1:05:48] the_howlermonkey: Ive been trying to tease that effing response from you for two months. Lol THANK YOU
[1:05:49] Nulgar: so what's with the hints that he's not with Blizzard anymore then?
[1:06:01] JarJar_Brinkz: @Nulgar Hints Kappa
[1:06:12] DiscordianKitty: we just haven't seen him mentioned once since before blizzcon
[1:06:19] JoeTheRedcoat: I never saw hair of him
[1:06:23] DiscordianKitty: not on any books, no interviews, nothing
[1:06:27] the_howlermonkey: I mean... He wasnt at blizzcon... That was the big tell
[1:06:49] Baylic: sorry I missed it who you talking about?
[1:06:57] kaijoe_: And people will continue to blame him for the lore.
[1:06:59] witchhobbit: i'm so out of the loop with this, was that person who lead shadowlands or?
[1:07:03] JoeTheRedcoat: You made me check LinkedIn
[1:07:08] RileyDoodles_: RileyDoodles_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:07:26] vlaovich88: That is sad. Hope he is doing okay.
[1:07:30] Obsosaurus: 2021
[1:07:32] Salfriel: how do people already have full archivist set? i've done it 4 times and all i got was 7k, not enough for the backpack.
[1:07:44] witchhobbit: @Salfriel alts probably
[1:07:58] JarJar_Brinkz: His own tweet? I'm not sure, but he is active on twitter LUL Blizz isn't on his twitter tho
[1:07:59] OmgItsEdizzle: Perhaps he's hella buried in World Soul Saga work and no time for socials?
[1:08:00] the_howlermonkey: i will say, while it sounded like i was crapping on him, i felt like he was treated unfairly by the public. HOWEVER... I dont know enough about the inside story to know if he actually screwed up storyline or was doing the best he could with a mess he inherited.
[1:08:08] Salfriel: @haleych yeah but the main quest, that gives you 5k you can only do once per account
[1:08:11] diarrhea_lad: tbf lots of people have abandoned the formerly-bird app
[1:08:11] Popicus: Is his bio new on twitter?
[1:08:28] Bambiprsi: he has in bio, that hes mostly inactive on twitter
[1:08:36] DiscordianKitty: the stuff people say about him is unhinged
[1:08:55] Arlaeya: I wouldn't blame him for stepping away and especially from Twitter
[1:08:58] JarJar_Brinkz: Says he moved to a new site
[1:09:03] thunduz: I liked steve. I thought he was great and had a real love for WoW
[1:09:34] the_howlermonkey: i always liked him and wanted the best for him. I had hoped he would reap the rewards of the success of DF.
[1:09:36] eternitycrystal: HeyGuys
[1:09:40] Synkronos: @Salfriel You can also get item drops from the boss, and you can do that every hour
[1:09:41] witchhobbit: he was head of narrative for shadowlands?
[1:10:11] Vaephera: Shadowlands was mostly designed while afrasiabi was still there. It's unclear who was in charge of what
[1:10:11] avatos_94: wait what idea?
[1:10:12] DiscordianKitty: it is so weird when chris has a self insert and isn't even shy about it?
[1:10:21] minorheadlines: lol made me start to look then!
[1:10:26] DozlaT: It has been interesting to see ppl go from complaining about metzens writing legion and pre legion ( green Jesus, corruption) to acting like he's saving wow
[1:10:28] OneAwesomePleb: Thoughts on 10.2.5?
[1:10:28] Valinor55: She's the President of Tennessee and we love her
[1:10:30] GameingAspect: dnt worry me like tht
[1:10:35] witchhobbit: @Vaephera ew...
[1:10:38] mydemoncat: lol
[1:11:03] HolocronCoder: From what I know, Nathanos is still somewhere in the Maw as a random soul, after that boss-battle version of him in the Plaguelands?
[1:11:14] minorheadlines: thats a weird take
[1:11:21] urbenjames: wait...dont we all want to?
[1:11:23] HolocronCoder: I mean, who DOESN'T want to fuck Sylvanas?
[1:11:23] avatos_94: jesus people are unhinged
[1:11:37] JarJar_Brinkz: We avoid that side of twitter
[1:11:41] cabeshpash: lol
[1:11:42] kaijoe_: Yup, they somehow are always on my timeline, despite muting all of them.
[1:11:43] Vaephera: I remember that as a screenshot from 4chan, and like half the facts of it were wrong to begin with
[1:11:46] sowercookie: No simping allowed, not even as a joke
[1:11:51] thorwann: The whole self insert thing, reminds me of how people kept shitting on Neil Druckmann over a " self insert " in The Last of Us 2, which turned out wasn't even a self insert at all.
[1:11:54] witchhobbit: that is weird
[1:11:56] DozlaT: I even see people on unrelated gaming forums mention that
[1:12:03] neverbornlucky: Taliesin isn't it wrong to ha ve sex with the dead ?
[1:12:21] cabeshpash: didn't you say they weren't allowed to kill of sylvannas because she was such a money maker?
[1:12:35] cabeshpash: kill off*
[1:12:39] Pannekaker: @TaliesinAndEvitel I mean, he worked on the hunter order hall and that was pretty banging, wasn't it?
[1:12:42] Fibnkak: Do you think Nathos got the new body because of the ability to have undead main character in the chinese market? or am i thinking too much
[1:13:07] influx_404_: People were mad about the burning of Teldrassil because they didn't have any marshmallows
[1:13:08] schlakt: you reckin there is any chance for a 10.2.6 announcment today?
[1:13:09] xaxxas_: Did you see the avaloren faker made a Gallywix/Dreadlord theory on mmochamp
[1:13:09] Aerisot: Yay! I made it to a tali stream!
[1:13:12] AspectoftheCheetah: i agree the community was horrible to him
[1:13:40] Fibnkak: that is completely true
[1:13:45] DiscordianKitty: maybe they should think about china then lol
[1:13:47] OneAwesomePleb: Thought's on 10.2.5?
[1:13:51] Nulgar: could just use different models for China anyway
[1:13:55] thunduz: the one time they didn't think of it
[1:13:59] AspectoftheCheetah: @pannekaker he did? still one of my favorite places in wow
[1:14:19] Dangeons_and_Dragons: Maldraxxus wouldnt have existed.
[1:14:23] databob1: his old body was really basic
[1:14:24] diarrhea_lad: I disagree, I don't think he looks cool at all. I think his Legion model was better
[1:14:27] avatos_94: did we ever find out what happened to nathanos?
[1:14:27] SunnyAutumns: Asmongold-fan brainrot
[1:14:30] AlanC2024: and tyrandes current model
[1:14:47] sowercookie: China picks and chooses which skeletons are fine and which get censored. The whole "they changed it for China" thing is so funny in gaming communities
[1:15:18] influx_404_: Is there an in game way to trigger the new cinematic yet?
[1:15:26] neverbornlucky: shadow lands was the best wow expansion EVER
[1:15:34] Aerisot: Tyrande just copied Ysera
[1:15:41] mydemoncat: oh wow Steve Danuser is from MInnesota
[1:15:43] JarJar_Brinkz: Tbf Gilneas isn't a Worgen city, it's a Gilnean city
[1:15:45] diarrhea_lad: @AlanC2023 shoulderblades for days
[1:15:58] Synkronos: Calia is at least part of a council, so having a diverse council is different to having an 'outsider' ruler
[1:16:17] insinc91: It's not like the old leaders are gone 'gone' either. Just taking a break it seems
[1:16:18] DiscordianKitty: I thought Shandris' leadership was led up to a lot better, she's been actively involved in Night Elf story for awhile
[1:16:20] PidiaP: I mean did those people not do the worgen heritage armor quest!?
[1:16:25] cabeshpash: 100%
[1:16:28] Sockfire: it felt super short, like we did we wait so long when this is all we had to do
[1:16:37] DozlaT: That would have been awesome
[1:16:39] cabeshpash: siege of gilneas was more what I was expecting with the battle
[1:16:49] thunduz: would have loved that
[1:16:53] schlakt: you think there is any chance for an 10.2.6 announcment today?
[1:16:53] DiscordianKitty: agreed
[1:16:54] OneAwesomePleb: How long is the quest line?
[1:17:04] cabeshpash: it's like 10 minutes @OneAwesomePleb
[1:17:07] Valinor55: felt like they just wanted it over with
[1:17:10] DarthTaz0: I liked that it was basically the reverse of the starting quest of losing the city. You start outside in the graveyard/town then take the escape tunnel into the city and fight in the courtyards back into the chappel for the boss fight.
[1:17:14] AlanC2024: mini opening of ahn qiraj in prep and then isle of quel danas in taking more ground
[1:17:44] ryarose42: ryarose42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[1:17:44] Singhy: The question is, is it still lag city?
[1:17:54] witchhobbit: yeah i really loved the ending cutscene, it was really well done it looked great
[1:17:54] sowercookie: dude that cinematic at the end was so good!
[1:18:30] ryarose42: This patch has some of the best cinematics wow has ever done imo
[1:18:32] OneAwesomePleb: How long did it take you to finish?
[1:18:38] DiscordianKitty: old world flying is incredible
[1:18:46] TownieTV: Dudes put Genn in a broker jar or something when I was doing ther quest. Bunch of disco balls about too.
[1:18:53] neverbornlucky: Taliesin would you rather they give you more poo collecting quest instead?
[1:19:00] Singhy: I need to catch up on story, been tying to cap on 18s each week
[1:19:15] AlanC2024: tyrande and malfurions reuniting was nice
[1:19:15] Synkronos: I think digs are more interesting as a first pass of some sort of Archeology replacement  system, that they will iterate on and improve
[1:19:17] Aerisot: Wouldn't Mia Graymane still be the queen of the Gilneans?
[1:19:17] thunduz: I feel like if I was ever going to get my nelf worgan it would have been now and it's probably not going to happen
[1:19:19] Arlaeya: Poo in Poocraft!
[1:19:26] Singhy: we have burning corpses instead of
[1:19:27] thunduz: woke poo
[1:19:30] fishermanmash: yep
[1:19:32] Vaephera: I'm surprised that they haven't hotfixed the heck out of digs yet. I'm wondering if there's more to unlock that's timegated instead
[1:19:32] butlerlog: facts
[1:19:34] sowercookie: woke poo
[1:19:37] funviking99: the disney argument is so dumb
[1:19:39] OneAwesomePleb: LOL
[1:19:40] Saumur: Let's be real: After the Retaking, Genn is now free to sacrifice himself for Anduin in the Next Xpac
[1:19:44] databob1: there was a poo daily in the caverns
[1:19:55] MichaelXIII: The Glineas transmog has poofy sleeves now.
[1:20:00] sowercookie: @saumur nooo don't say that!
[1:20:03] CeasiusPls: so do you think the disney buzzword means woke?
[1:20:38] witchhobbit: yup
[1:20:41] Valinor55: i thought the we found Anduin lines you can listen to between Genn and Shaw to be exciting
[1:20:45] JarJar_Brinkz: It was released as the wrong file, if anything. I'm pretty sure it wasn't intentional
[1:20:45] OneAwesomePleb: Do you usually stream alone?
[1:20:49] LowInitiative: They seem really intent on getting all these loose threads tied up before end of Saga/2.0, I just want to see what Illidan has been up to since legion, like has he already taken Sargeras power and become the last titan already :D
[1:20:52] CeasiusPls: To me it just meant it wasn't gritty, like Arcane is inclusive but it's gritty. Wow isn't at all
[1:20:58] butlerlog: i thought that was a given tbh
[1:21:12] frozeusgaming: woke is used by conservatives in the us to describe anything non white. lol
[1:21:18] Saumur: @sowercookie No one wants to see the best boy die, but I guess hes on borrowed time now :(
[1:21:34] RIckjamesx: void hunter is the new class in the expansion after the war within
[1:21:35] witchhobbit: @frozeusgaming not only that but yeah
[1:21:44] JarJar_Brinkz: @frozeusgaming yup
[1:21:48] thunduz: tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf  Illidan time!
[1:21:50] Saumur: @TaliesinAndEvitel You still owe us your expectations for the Story of War Within LUL
[1:21:53] Atomicpanda: SIGH
[1:21:55] Theorof: They need to turn Genn into a fishing trainer that talks about being retired.
[1:21:59] sowercookie: as an certified Illidan stan, please no more Illidan
[1:22:10] cabeshpash: @Saumur patiently waiting LUL
[1:22:14] thunduz: I always want more illidan
[1:22:18] thorwann: The best change in 10.2.5 is empowered soar by far, it feels so cool use your own wings as an evoker rather than riding a dragon
[1:22:18] Aerisot: Illidan and Sargaras are going to have an understanding, and realize the other Titans were bad all a long and he was trying to stop them.
[1:22:20] funviking99: Illidan will be back for sure
[1:22:22] Valinor55: Break Glass in Emergency - Illidan
[1:22:36] thunduz: I AM MY SCARS
[1:22:45] JarJar_Brinkz: Illidan needs to turn down his reverb
[1:22:48] funviking99: What a gigachad
[1:22:55] witchhobbit: i love illidan i love liam obrien
[1:22:58] TheDeekins: legit one of the best story beats in the entire history of WOW
[1:23:01] sowercookie: Leave the sad man be 😭
[1:23:07] Lacee666: BibleThump
[1:23:10] cabeshpash: we need a good wow movie

[1:23:24] cabeshpash: lol true
[1:23:27] Valinor55: Illidan could have soloed the Jailer, we all know it is true :D
[1:23:30] funviking99: so good
[1:23:32] thunduz: Met Liam once and I swear I was the only one there for Illidan and not critical role lol
[1:23:50] TownieTV: i love how the relationship develops between Velen and Illidan.
[1:23:52] PinkSharkie: baddass <3
[1:23:53] JarJar_Brinkz: What if Sargeras stopped, and said "we're a family"
[1:23:55] frozeusgaming: A good wow movie would have to be rated ma like game on thrones. That other wow movie was a pos.
[1:24:02] AlanC2024: what sword
[1:24:03] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi  Sargaras also hides like Iridikron
[1:24:06] PinkSharkie: ITS THAT SWORD!!!
[1:24:09] Aerisot: His hand is just casually destroying Eastern Kingdoms
[1:24:18] funviking99: LUL LUL
[1:24:22] TheDeekins: they didn't need to fly so close!!!
[1:24:31] loganskywalkr: does he not have legs lol
[1:24:31] cabeshpash: @frozeusgaming idk the wow storyline is pretty PG for the most part, it's like a Saturday morning cartoon. Not saying I don't enjoy it though
[1:24:38] Valinor55: I miss Legion
[1:24:46] HolocronCoder: Man, I kinda miss Illidan
[1:24:51] databob1: someone did a ground point of view of the sword hitting it was awsome
[1:24:51] phritss: Or a great beginning for him in the future.
[1:24:55] cabeshpash: I missed that whole storyline
[1:24:58] goqu3D: Phrasing
[1:25:00] frozeusgaming: ayo
[1:25:02] misterstimpak: Phrasing?
[1:25:05] sowercookie: Ayo
[1:25:08] cabeshpash: Illidan was one of the greatest chars since WC3 though
[1:25:10] nataliequay: lol
[1:25:11] thunduz: tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf tneMeatloaf
[1:25:12] kaijoe_: 1v1 me bro
[1:25:12] Synkronos: "suck Sargeras off" Kreygasm
[1:25:18] the_danbat: cuppa
[1:25:18] cabeshpash: I wish Arthas got that good of an ending
[1:25:20] Valinor55: epic fight
[1:25:21] Solbiaa: Illidan slays
[1:25:23] RIckjamesx: its a 10 year long game of chess
[1:25:26] JarJar_Brinkz: Illidan is dead
[1:25:27] Lacee666: they play chess
[1:25:29] pumeister93: Coffee and cake
[1:25:29] CeasiusPls: he's like a dog that caught the truck
[1:25:31] Atomicpanda: i ship them
[1:25:34] RIckjamesx: and ilidan has to start with the black
[1:25:35] Sockfire: edgelord battle
[1:25:35] grimblymcgoo: Illidan is a power bottom
[1:25:38] thunduz: Sargaras in chains and a chat
[1:25:44] SurgioClemente: cuddling normally happens after?
[1:25:46] LordKurgen: a cup of tea and a chin wag
[1:25:49] databob1: they're just up there playing cards
[1:25:53] Eprosis: They binge watch drag race
[1:25:58] avatos_94: a roomate sitcom
[1:26:02] Redmanpig: Illidan is IMPRISONED FOR TEEEEENNNN THOUSAND YEARS!
[1:26:03] schlakt: will be so hype when he comes back in the story
[1:26:04] funviking99: they chill
[1:26:04] magnetit: Where did Sargeras put his other hand when he stabbed Silithus?
[1:26:06] funviking99: LUL
[1:26:06] Aerisot: Sargaras kills the other Pantheon just as he did before, and takes Illidan's body as his vessel.
[1:26:09] DozlaT: Talking his ear off?
[1:26:10] butlerlog: illidan becoming the jailor would be the most sensible story beat
[1:26:11] phritss: Illidan beats him for a beat and imprisons him.
[1:26:14] thunduz: look how happy he is
[1:26:16] Theorof: 10,000 years of dance battle
[1:26:18] AlanC2024: illidan has taken maiev's place but going extreme like he always does
[1:26:21] thunduz: yes
[1:26:21] LowInitiative: I mean, illidan with an immortal demon soul in a realm of no escape... Wouldn't that just be and endless fight? And Since demonhunters/Illidan cleave souls and absorb fel/demon power.... Wouldn't that lead to him just taking it all?
[1:26:34] DozlaT: Honestly they may come to an accord
[1:26:34] sowercookie: Good point
[1:26:35] Saumur: I believe they just imrpisoned Illidan and Sargeras in one of their shiny ring-prisons
[1:26:37] TownieTV: Illidan does have the assets worthy of the title Jailor
[1:26:51] Triskelian: So, Sargeras is the ultimate raid training dummy? :D
[1:27:07] phritss: Yeah, torture for a bit and then locked up.
[1:27:07] the_danbat: do they have food up there?
[1:27:09] ShadarLogoth: so what happens to the pantheon for it to become the "last" titan?
[1:27:14] cabeshpash: titans are AFK though
[1:27:16] butlerlog: illidan is just practicing his rotation on sargeras to be ready for his return
[1:27:20] doomer_dan_: doomer_dan_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Tali is the hottest boy
[1:27:29] LowInitiative: I mean, after using their essence to make the prison, would they even have a say in what Illidan can do?
[1:27:33] cabeshpash: lol
[1:27:37] Saumur: Imprisoned as well - Collateral damage
[1:27:37] thunduz: hmmmmm do you think they would do a "story twist!" and reveal to illidan they were actually plotting together?
[1:27:40] Valinor55: Was Sargeras not in the way of whatever their plan was for Order? Seems like they'd either want him out of the picture or put back on the path of their plan
[1:27:45] phritss: I don't think they "care" about him, I think that he has too much power to be "destroyed"
[1:28:03] cabeshpash: still waiting on your predictions for the TWW @TaliesinAndEvitel :)
[1:28:11] DozlaT: I think illidan could see he was misled and what he wanted to do
[1:28:18] funviking99: or Sargera killed all the other titans and he is the only one left hence the expansion: the last titan
[1:28:22] TownieTV: see the rehabilitation scene from Idiocracy
[1:28:22] AlanC2024: Can Illidan even hurt Sargeras who is the strongest titan. It took all the rest to stop him
[1:28:37] Aerisot: Do you think the Pantheon know that they are just robots built by the First Ones?
[1:28:41] thunduz: rehabilitating him feels like a different vibe then what the story has been wanting us to think of them
[1:28:41] butlerlog: if only they had a nice handy receptacle for all that fel power they suck out of sargeras
[1:28:43] frozensentinel97: illidan still has fel inside him… Will they team up?
[1:28:58] Saumur: Imagine: Sargeras is still too powerful for the Pantheon and kills them all again - And HE is the Last Titan Kappa
[1:29:03] neverbornlucky: Taliesin, God was a alien
[1:29:05] cabeshpash: meat robots
[1:29:06] JarJar_Brinkz: MrDestructoid Oh no, he's onto me MrDestructoid
[1:29:06] sowercookie: I think they care about him in the way rich families care about each other, where they hate each other but also won't let some rando mess with them @phritss
[1:29:09] UrzakTV: Maybe Sargeras was trying to break her out of her Titan prison instead of killing her. like he was aiming for the lock.
[1:29:17] Valinor55: I mean if he rebelled against the rest of the Titans he clearly was not going along with their plan, I guess rehabilitation makes sense because whatever their master plan was should have included him I would think
[1:29:20] AlanC2024: Titans as far as we know are born from Planets so are they robots from the first ones?
[1:29:32] gkwazy: maybe they will use illidan to remove the fel from Sargeras and hurting ilidan in the process
[1:29:36] Nulgar: @Aerisot you're thinking of the Eternal Ones in the Shadowlands, who are rather golems, or even just constructs piloted by actual souls
[1:29:37] Reminii91: Philosophy stream today
[1:29:41] magisterofquelthalas: Heyyy
[1:29:43] LowInitiative: I mean, Titans have used vessels, and Sargeras was like a half cloud.... I don't think form is a worry for them, they are just "titans"
[1:29:46] neverbornlucky: Taliesin say it with me Jesus was a Alien
[1:29:48] ropergaran: ropergaran is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 45 in the channel! 
[1:29:48] thunduz: this is the start of my midlife crises. "What is the meaning of this, we're all just meat robots!"
[1:29:49] ropergaran: ropergaran gifted a Tier 1 sub to visualcompost! 
[1:29:49] ropergaran: ropergaran gifted a Tier 1 sub to Annjia! 
[1:29:49] ropergaran: ropergaran gifted a Tier 1 sub to Athaerick! 
[1:29:49] ropergaran: ropergaran gifted a Tier 1 sub to blinded_by_the_scalp! 
[1:29:49] ropergaran: ropergaran gifted a Tier 1 sub to qaikk! 
[1:29:50] Atomicpanda: six is having problems adjusting to his clone status
[1:29:53] goldengrubate: we are the electricity inside a meat computer inside a meat mech
[1:29:54] gkwazy: return order to Sargaras
[1:30:00] misterstimpak: No, making us from Clay would make us Golems, obviously Tali.
[1:30:06] phritss: @sowercookie Perhaps, but is there anything in the story that says so. It seems to be conjecture.
[1:30:17] Aerisot: Well, I meant, if they knew, wouldn't that be the easiest way to reboot Sargaras?
[1:30:18] LowInitiative: The whole "they robots" in shadowlands isn't new when you consider the use of Avatars and stuff
[1:30:23] magisterofquelthalas: Twitch has increased the rate of ads i guess. Well they have some financial making up to do
[1:30:29] JarJar_Brinkz: Ulduar is literally a 3d printing station, it's never been new
[1:30:30] AlanC2024: I don't think titan are have a creator. They are borne from planets
[1:30:51] neverbornlucky: Taliesin why can't you say it Jesus and God were ALIENS
[1:30:52] AlanC2024: the world souls maybe
[1:30:56] Arlaeya: chicken egg planet titan
[1:31:01] RileyDoodles_: who made the planets? O.O
[1:31:04] RIckjamesx: the planets are made in planet hollywood
[1:31:08] Ob1dragonborn: I got an add when I came in also
[1:31:10] LilyOfTremere: You didn't pause the vid on a very flattering image of Illidan x) Poor boi
[1:31:12] phritss: I get ads on this channel.
[1:31:17] phritss: Just a heads up
[1:31:21] cabeshpash: :)
[1:31:22] Reminii91: the Titans weren't born when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much...?
[1:31:25] Scargon231: but wasn’t this all the jailer’s plan?
[1:31:25] Baylic: is the primus a titan?
[1:31:26] JarJar_Brinkz: monkaS
[1:31:40] RileyDoodles_: very special mommy daddy titan hug
[1:31:43] Popicus: Ads show up when you click on the stream, as he can't turn those off, but shouldn't get midrolls
[1:31:47] Saumur: I never got Ads here, which is weird enough
[1:31:49] phritss: Before I watch, not all the times.
[1:31:49] SunnyAutumns: Did Jesus invent the table
[1:31:50] grimblymcgoo: when you first join you get ads here, otherwise they are off
[1:31:52] AlanC2024: Primus? No
[1:31:52] Triskelian: Over a quarter of the way to Naked Penrin! :D
[1:31:52] minorheadlines: I got a pre-roll
[1:31:54] chico_escuela: I get an ad when I join about half the time
[1:31:58] schlakt: only when i start watching for me
[1:32:00] falsestreams: twitch runs their own ads even if you have yours off
[1:32:04] Ob1dragonborn: just when I come in
[1:32:04] phritss: No mid-roll and thank you for that!
[1:32:07] hazard_mtg: i dont anymore i stopped subbing to everyone unfortunatley in favor of turbo it sucks
[1:32:08] thunduz: tneEvi
[1:32:10] magisterofquelthalas: Random for me.
[1:32:18] JarJar_Brinkz: That was really nice of him
[1:32:18] chico_escuela: Jesus invented the mid roll
[1:32:20] minorheadlines: nah Jesus was a boat fixer - thats why he hung around with those fishermen
[1:32:26] TownieTV: i have never gotten a preroll or midroll ad on this channel
[1:32:28] vtech310: but not during stream. its never during stream
[1:32:31] the_howlermonkey: The Jailer put the baby titans in the planets.
[1:32:32] Saiyori: Subs do avoid the preroll
[1:32:34] Popicus: Subs can avoid it
[1:32:36] magisterofquelthalas: But on this channel? I might be remembering wrong i watch multiple channels
[1:32:36] DiscordianKitty: subs don't get
[1:32:37] LowInitiative: Also, if Titans are "order" why are they born in the "reality" realm. Like the Eternal ones are of death and not born in planets...We know titans lie... We sure Azeroth isn't just a first one soul?
[1:32:39] hectorian01: ok, but back a little bit, what was the dragonriding trick? :)))
[1:32:46] CrossroadsDealer: Jesus invented the table but chairs did not come around for 200 more years. it was an awkward time.
[1:32:57] TankieLite: Just arrived, are we becoming our scars in here
[1:32:58] magisterofquelthalas: Yeah subs dont get any ads
[1:33:26] Azikielboi: @TaliesinAndEvitel ive been thinking about what u said about how they have to beat players over the head with smth or else they will say nothing happened, as i dont think very many people at all understood what iridikron was doing in DotI
[1:33:26] magisterofquelthalas: Also I am my scars
[1:33:44] Solbiaa: Why do you assume torture?
[1:33:48] misterstimpak: The existence of Void Lords existing over the Old Gods kind of makes an argument for Order Lords over the Titans.
[1:33:49] RIckjamesx: really cool night elf dude though
[1:33:50] thunduz: uno reverse card they're all torturing him now
[1:33:50] Triskelian: One of us! One of us!!!
[1:33:53] phritss: What bothers people about the robot is that it brings up a philosophical issue about the souls and free-will. I think it brings too much complication. Sometimes, just not answering a question is better.
[1:33:56] Solbiaa: Kill
[1:33:59] cabeshpash: do you think that will be part of the TWW then?
[1:34:03] Valinor55: I'm backing the rehabilitation plan now, that makes sense to me.  Let's be for real, Illidan has spent the past 6 years realizing how crazy the Titans are
[1:34:05] gabekan: They are playing WoW together
[1:34:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesin he's waterboarding him
[1:34:06] Solbiaa: Yes
[1:34:12] HypnoPingu: Romantic time with him
[1:34:14] hectorian01: just like the jailer for him
[1:34:18] Synkronos: What about a lovely tea party, just the two of them?
[1:34:25] hectorian01: making sure he doesnt escape
[1:34:26] Katsutomai: I'm.. not sure Illidan could kill Sargearas even if the others let him.
[1:34:28] TankieLite: Then they kiss
[1:34:31] SleepyNoodle_Z: Illidian is always scheming
[1:34:32] falsestreams: lol unhinged nightelf that brought the support of the whole world against sarg.. yeah he wants to torture him
[1:34:37] HiddenSquid188: Titan tho
[1:34:44] HiddenSquid188: I would try it
[1:34:48] chico_escuela: theyve always tried to stop him not kill him
[1:35:02] hectorian01: yes
[1:35:04] Aerisot: Sargaras did torture their souls for a while.
[1:35:05] RIckjamesx: Illido or illidont, be damned either way
[1:35:06] Solbiaa: I think he would if he couldn't kill him
[1:35:15] SleepyNoodle_Z: Hes gonna consume the skull of Sargeras
[1:35:22] ryarose42: Illiadan becoming a warden tho is kind of a poetic ending
[1:35:26] sowercookie: Maybe the titans got two birds with one stone there, Illidan can be a problem
[1:35:28] thunduz: Illidan going from the prisoner to the jailer (not that one) is pretty great
[1:35:28] TheDeekins: It'd be pretty funny if the next time we see Illidan the titans have him in a prison -- bonus points of time dilation has him in there for 10,000 years
[1:35:30] falsestreams: yeah illi is probably tired, just wants to watch him suffer for eternity in isolation
[1:35:32] phritss: Do you think Illidan could syphon any of sargaras' power?  (I don't know by what means)
[1:35:40] RhubarbToast: "Just a liiiiiittle torture, guys?"
[1:35:43] hazard_mtg: i think the void will attempt to release sargeras and it might give illidan a way to kill him
[1:35:54] hazard_mtg: or fight him
[1:36:07] HiddenSquid188: come on, let’s have faith that Blizz will write really well rounded story, wait I'm I dreaming...
[1:36:12] avatos_94: i think amanthul will see a fel corrupted being in illidan and lock him up too
[1:36:17] thunduz: OR Illidan killed them all and that's why we haven't heard from them
[1:36:19] Scargon231: I’m really starting to like the ship them route
[1:36:21] AlanC2024: Illidans will fight sargeras to keep him there. the other titans are weakening him so maybe even deadlock
[1:36:21] RIckjamesx: Illidan fuses with sargeras, and becomes Sargeradan
[1:36:29] butlerlog: i know it wouldnt put the titans off, but i really wouldn't recommend they start a war with illidan
[1:36:40] Triskelian: Don't forget,
[1:36:47] Solbiaa: @TaliesinAndEvitel Illidan returns with new found perspective and Demon Hunters get a 3rd support spec, win win
[1:36:48] C_Ramrod: yes!
[1:36:56] Theorof: Illidan slowly absorbs the titan power and rises to become their leader.
[1:37:00] thunduz: I have decided Illidan killed them all, absorbed their power, and hes now a titan. The very thing he hated lol
[1:37:01] TankieLite: Unrelated to the lore, how is shadow priest feeling this patch
[1:37:03] Katsutomai: LUL
[1:37:07] C_Ramrod: I feel like Illidan will be a prisoner or made to serve.
[1:37:09] Triskelian: Don't forget, Tali, which one of the devs said that if the red star in the sky ever disappears it would be bad news?
[1:37:10] Aerisot: Illidan has lost pretty much every fight he has been in, I do not see him winning against Sargaras or any of the Titans
[1:37:11] thunduz: one might say hes the last titan
[1:37:11] phritss: It would be great if we get up back up there and they are all dead and Illidan is sitting on the thrown smoking a cigar. That's what I want to see.
[1:37:14] ryarose42: Poor Illidan keeps getting locked up
[1:37:19] Atomicpanda: given him more scars
[1:37:44] thunduz: very possible
[1:37:45] LowInitiative: Its probably a mix of all of them... No one is killing anyone... immortal soul illidan, and titans, and it probably starts as violence and hunt... and maybe over time therapy/character growth happens.
[1:37:47] butlerlog: azerothians wouldn't tolerate that if they found out illidan is a prisoner, even his detractors have massive respect for him now
[1:37:54] DozlaT: I honestly think him and illidan would come to an understanding
[1:37:55] sowercookie: Oh I actually like that, finally the team up!
[1:38:05] Aerisot: I have been saying for years that Sargaras was trying to free Azeroth, not destroy her.
[1:38:08] Saumur: Well, Illidan has Demon-horns. Would they throw him into the Horny-Jail then? Kappa
[1:38:12] databob1: their going to domesticate him like a puppy
[1:38:18] thunduz: The Magneto/Professor X team-up we've all been waiting for
[1:38:19] Synkronos: The only unit of Night Elf time is "TEN THOUSAND YEARS!", it is known
[1:38:21] Solbiaa: They'd just put him in stasis or something I'm sure
[1:38:26] minorheadlines: nah too confusing -- they wont run with that. They 'may' make Illidin drunk on 'order juice' (rather than Holy bonds or fel)
[1:38:41] HiddenSquid188: Can you kill a Titan?
[1:38:42] ponderingpermanence: illidan is too thick skulled
[1:38:43] Nulgar: eh, would only like that if that made Illidan convince Sargeras to the cause of the mortals
[1:38:55] Solbiaa: Really it depends on the kind of corruption
[1:38:59] butlerlog: whatever happens, illidan never has a good time or gets what he deserves, his role is to be hard done by to fuel his edge
[1:39:09] AlanC2024: not really. he will not join with sargeras but he will not trust the titans and when they all get out illidan will warn us about them all
[1:39:10] helheimr: RIP Argus
[1:39:11] HiddenSquid188: touché
[1:39:26] neverbornlucky: Taliesin my wife said a good knife can kill any Titan in anyones pants
[1:39:34] phritss: Here is a question, what is "that sword" has a part of sargarus and he isn't fully imprisoned.
[1:39:35] HolocronCoder: Argus, the C-Section Titan
[1:40:02] Atomicpanda: what sword?
[1:40:09] skeletonetiquette: skeletonetiquette subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! Favorite creator on a Friday! Let's goooo
[1:40:17] Saumur: Norgannon did thas
[1:40:21] AlanC2024: Eonar
[1:40:22] Katsutomai: Eonar
[1:40:24] Saiyori: could mean that the war within is for control over the world soul's "body" that hasn't hatched yet. between sargeras and azeroth
[1:40:33] Atomicpanda: E N R
[1:40:42] thunduz: just yeeted them across the universe
[1:40:47] urbenjames: A game Theory?
[1:40:49] phritss: Just one I made up, just now.
[1:40:52] HiddenSquid188: @saiyori on snap!
[1:40:53] cabeshpash: TWW predictions? :) @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:41:08] Aerisot: Didn't we absorb his energy in our artifact weapons?
[1:41:18] theDirtyon3: ^
[1:41:35] AlanC2024: All that the titans have is sargeras's physical form. its like a doctor who 2 parter with david tenant
[1:41:38] samwyzh9: Illidari need better dental confirmed.
[1:41:40] kaijoe_: He's already made 1 avatar of himself
[1:41:40] butlerlog: like when he put his avatar in aegwynn
[1:41:47] Arlaeya: the sword is a bookmark?
[1:42:00] Triskelian: Mm, I think that easter egg dialog in Silithus contradicts what you're saying Tali
[1:42:01] the_howlermonkey: that is an awesome theory.. an dhis body flailing to grab the sword as he was sucked away was the meat trying to hold onto the soul.
[1:42:03] skeletonetiquette: Are we in question second channel recording?
[1:42:09] sowercookie: And Illidan doesn't get any satisfaction because Sarg is offline, brilliant!
[1:42:12] Sockfire: It's a good theory, but I don't think that's what blizzard is doing. They have the star in the sky and we're suppose to be worried if it disappears.
[1:42:15] LowInitiative: We are probably gonna need to open the Prison to release the dark titan like an attack dog on the void, and we see flaming horns and fire and its like "oh here comes Sargeras just for two massive wings to pop out and Illidan yells at the Void Lord "You are not prepared" :D
[1:42:19] HiddenSquid188: like a horcru, we will@have quests to kill the sword and other parts of him
[1:42:21] xaxxas_: ya see the theory video about Gallywix/Dreadlords on mmochamp?
[1:42:25] HiddenSquid188: horcrux*
[1:42:32] thunduz: thats good
[1:42:37] SleepyNoodle_Z: Sword is Egg
[1:42:39] Atomicpanda: like and subscribe
[1:42:43] butlerlog: thats quality clickbait
[1:42:49] samwyzh9: I always thought Illidan would “replace” sargeras among the titans.
[1:42:50] UrzakTV: Didn’t we purge Sargeras’ sloppy seconds out of the sword at the end of Legion with our artifacts?
[1:42:54] TiredZubat: Sargeras in the sword? The way zalatath was in the dagger? (Sorry im late to the conversation)
[1:42:58] Xulu_: A horcrux?
[1:42:58] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to phritss! 
[1:43:04] Arlaeya: ahhhh
[1:43:07] AlanC2024: reminds me of the satin pit episode from doctor who. david tennants run with a kind of devil
[1:43:10] Tannrok: like a Hokrux @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:43:10] avatos_94: do you think amanthul would really work with him? i feel like he’d only see him as flawed, he didn’t even like the world tree eonar planted
[1:43:13] LordKurgen: usb drive
[1:43:17] MrBojangus: MrBojangus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[1:43:18] KanaCiCi: it would be funny if Azeroth was a planet transformer 🤭
[1:43:19] phritss: @thunduz Thanks for the gift sub. Money is tight, means a lot.
[1:43:25] sowercookie: It's a trojan
[1:43:27] samwyzh9: it is a trojan horse
[1:43:29] butlerlog: yeah isnt that what we purged all our artifact weapons to prevent happening though?
[1:43:52] thunduz: @phritss my pleasure. Great idea!
[1:44:04] Saiyori: man this is such a cool idea
[1:44:16] butlerlog: ye
[1:44:25] ajman1101: @taliesinandevitel if sargaras is in the sword in slithus, what did our artifact weapons do to him?
[1:44:25] Saiyori: artifact power could have just delayed it
[1:44:39] AlanC2024: and xalathath
[1:44:42] sowercookie: *facepalm* omg
[1:44:45] Saiyori: And the DH glaives..
[1:44:56] Saiyori: isnt one of them related to KJ?
[1:45:03] skeletonetiquette: I don't recall who said it but someone said when the red star goes dark it means it's bad news for us. It was at a Blizzcon. The red star represents Sarg
[1:45:03] hazard_mtg: and aluneth
[1:45:04] butlerlog: they can just say that we purged it but like an ember survived and when whatever expansion comes by then its grown again
[1:45:07] phritss: lol
[1:45:08] Xithraldor: all the DK weapons
[1:45:09] Sch1ey: Apocalypse
[1:45:11] HiddenSquid188: I can imagine the writing department at Blizz just sitting around shooting so many different ideas around this topic lol
[1:45:11] sowercookie: Good job fixing it hero
[1:45:19] thunduz: lol poor villains getting trapped weapons. Xal, Daddy D, Sargaras
[1:45:24] aurum2509: xalatath wasn’t used it canonically went missing
[1:45:29] AlanC2024: or we put him to sleep or he he hid in it
[1:45:47] Natolaeh: so Illidan WAS prepard?
[1:45:48] SleepyNoodle_Z: sacrificed Xal'atath, right?
[1:45:53] realGameTheory: lmao
[1:46:02] Nulgar: aww, just as I was telling him he's sad, too tneEvi
[1:46:03] Saiyori: @zixxik her power, but she survived
[1:46:08] Saiyori: so certainly others could have as well
[1:46:13] d30xx: HELLOOOOO
[1:46:28] aurum2509: the platinum wow video said she wasn’t used on the sword
[1:46:45] AlanC2024: with Aegwynn and Medivh. Sargeras did that
[1:46:55] aurum2509: cannocicaly tho
[1:47:04] aurum2509: like lorewise
[1:47:07] d30xx: Is that another yellow shirt?
[1:47:10] phritss: How were you again?
[1:47:15] helheimr: also in BFA she calls the player ingrateful for using her to damp the sword
[1:47:17] SunnyAutumns: that's not real
[1:47:20] SunnyAutumns: that's not true
[1:47:20] phritss: I want to see that stance again. lol
[1:47:23] ajman1101: dumb q: how do we know sargeras is in the sword? i remember him holding the sword and recoiling away from the planet as he died. did i forget something?
[1:47:33] HiddenSquid188: tneTaliWasRight_SG
[1:47:47] databob1: mabye using xalatath on the sword just helped her get out later
[1:47:54] KanaCiCi: @ajman1101 ancient magics lol. 😂
[1:47:55] AlanC2024: @ajman1101 Just a theory that he put his soul in it
[1:47:57] Sindorein1124: they are still sitting in our banks because we
[1:48:05] Saiyori: Would be kinda neat if in a future expansion we use them /again/ but theyre corrupted or something
[1:48:06] DiscordianKitty: I don't know if you saw the tweet asking the difference between the Jailer and Iridikron and I unironically find it an interesting thing to think about, why Iridikron landed and the Jailer didn't
[1:48:08] LordKurgen: still in my bank
[1:48:19] KeyouiX: yea ashbringer is in my bfelf's bank
[1:48:28] Teth33: Teth33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! late to the party but so glad for some cool lore talk.
[1:48:29] sowercookie: So what you're saying is it's already established in context that weird stuff can be in swords/weapons hmmmm
[1:48:44] ajman1101: ty for the replies chat. its a fun theory!
[1:48:44] Sorin__: iridikron doesn't have his nips and toes out
[1:48:50] DiscordianKitty: Iridikron has been tied nicely into Galakrond without them going Iridikron was actually behind Galakrond all along
[1:48:50] kaijoe_: War of the Scaleborn also kinda gives more context to Iridikron
[1:48:57] CeasiusPls: A dragon is also more like something we can fight vs a Titan++ godlike being
[1:48:58] PrankandCrank: Iridikron is a gigachad and the Jailor sucked there simple answer.
[1:49:04] SleepyNoodle_Z: I was so hyped for Shadowlands but jailor was written so horribly
[1:49:13] phritss: I think the Jailer's look had a lot to do with it too. He looked like a He-Man villian.
[1:49:20] Sorin__: also caused havoc with sylvanas
[1:49:32] cabeshpash: yeah IDK like what they did with the arthas storyline post Wrath
[1:49:36] Theorof: This picture of Illidan looks like he is having a difficult poo.
[1:49:45] databob1: I still think that the jailer would have been better if he had just been throwing everything at the wall instead of playing 4d chess
[1:49:47] the_howlermonkey: i thnk sargeras will be "the last titan"
[1:49:52] AlanC2024: I wan denathrius Back!
[1:50:00] Valinor55: I never liked the "but really it was always the Jailer" is how a lot of the lore came off which changed everything we'd learned over the years.
[1:50:14] LilyOfTremere: @Theorof Ye it's not very flattering :(
[1:50:14] RosieSeren: the shadow creature behind sylvanus in one of the earliest trailers was a much better character design
[1:50:18] Nulgar: it's funny, people say that Arthas was a good guy up until picking up Frostmourne or merging with the Lich King, that he was just manipulated, but hint even a bit that there's an even greater evil manipulating Arthas, and they go mad
[1:50:26] cabeshpash: they should just retcon all of shadowlands lol
[1:50:33] T3ddyFr3ddy: shadowlands was unfortunately a very bad exp story wise. Jailor was a terrible end boss. The entire thing with breaking the boundry between life and death was a terrible idea
[1:50:39] HiddenSquid188: tneWowkiller changing game lore
[1:50:40] JoeTheRedcoat: I hope Xal'atath links up with Remornia
[1:50:42] cabeshpash: shadowlands made a mess of the lore
[1:50:43] Teth33: The incarnates  don't change the lore, they expand it. That was what was missing with the Jailer.
[1:50:48] KanaCiCi: if we are going back in time in new expansion again will old lore be rewritten 🫢
[1:51:05] Kyle_Voltti: Regardless of anything else, I think we can all agree that Malfurion and Tyrande are going to wreck bedframes between now and the next expac....
[1:51:10] RosieSeren: also just going to the 'afterlife' is such a bad choice
[1:51:11] menzlo: He's also less arrogant
[1:51:14] MrGM: 136 raiders from MrGM have joined! 
[1:51:18] T3ddyFr3ddy: and Sylvannas back and forth was shitty as well as they had spent so much time making her a good person for the horde only to turn her terrible and then in the end regrett it all
[1:51:19] Clodagh_Lunaria: Good evening <3
[1:51:33] vimie: 2020ByeGuys
[1:51:41] Triskelian: @Clodagh_Lunaria CLO!!!!!!
[1:51:43] Uchiha_Cloaky: Hi
[1:51:45] Clodagh_Lunaria: @Triskelian Trisk <3
[1:51:46] DiscordianKitty: i love dawn of the aspects, hate doing it on mythic though
[1:51:47] KeyouiX: @T3ddyFr3ddy yea that sucked so bad as a longtime sylvanas fan
[1:51:52] Saiyori: I think the coolest thing about that dungeon is that we could have defeated his plans but we CHOSE not to in order to save Nozdormu
[1:52:03] Teth33: This is the first expac I remember where the important things all happen onscreen and you take part.
[1:52:04] Clodagh_Lunaria: clodagWiggle clodagWiggle
[1:52:05] magisterofquelthalas: What do u think about the execution of the main plot on DF?
[1:52:13] T3ddyFr3ddy: Dawn is the best of the DF dungeons and there is only like brackenhide that is good expect Dawn
[1:52:14] DiscordianKitty: you're a priest, so when the roleplay is going on you're still walking it's fine
[1:52:14] MrGM: its completed, so boring now
[1:52:16] MrGM: you're welcome <3
[1:52:17] menzlo: They only humanized jailer in his death cinematic
[1:52:18] AlanC2024: Iridkrons origanal reasons for going to war with the aspects makes sense though which aslo makes him a good villan
[1:52:22] aeson_of_raid_sock: Did you get loremaster?
[1:52:29] Synkronos: I've done both Rise and Fall so many times on so many characters, the gear is so good in there
[1:52:32] Triskelian: clodagHype clodagHype clodagHype clodagHype clodagHype
[1:53:01] snagprophet: perhaps the Jailer should've remained as an unknown force and we get glimpses of something
[1:53:03] T3ddyFr3ddy: It felt that Blizz didnt have a clear view of what the idea and story was in Shadowlands
[1:53:04] Clodagh_Lunaria: @Triskelian clodagHype clodagHype clodagHype clodagRave clodagRave clodagRave
[1:53:11] kaijoe_: I think the Jailor's REAL 4D chess plan is that the community will never ever stop talking about it for the rest of WoW's life
[1:53:17] SleepyNoodle_Z: But we are not mortals, it is so weird.
[1:53:19] SunnyAutumns: There's a mutual respect with Iridikron
[1:53:35] snagprophet: draenei
[1:53:37] Singhy: are we ze baddies?
[1:53:39] Promilie: Dracthyr may be immortalø
[1:53:39] magisterofquelthalas: Story was about S6lvanas, it wasnt half bad story too. But then Jailor ruins every aspect of it
[1:53:39] BosakMaw: earthen
[1:53:40] T3ddyFr3ddy: Also, all the damn factions in SL was so bad because Blizz tried to make them too different.
[1:53:43] SleepyNoodle_Z: I can click resurrect
[1:53:44] AlanC2024: yep. I think he knew at one time that Neltharion is dead and that we killed him
[1:53:46] pagan_pg: @Singhy WAiting for this plot twist
[1:53:47] snagprophet: Night elves with the well of eternity?
[1:53:51] cabeshpash: dragons are not
[1:53:52] SunnyAutumns: Forsaken I guess
[1:53:58] metalwarrior1977: Undead
[1:53:59] T3ddyFr3ddy: @TaliesinAndEvitel you  might be mortal...Im blood elf, Im immortal! :D
[1:54:00] CeasiusPls: Mortals have been used in different contexts throughout the history of WoW
[1:54:00] Singhy: if we bleed we are mortal
[1:54:01] Teth33: Mechagnomes maybe.
[1:54:01] metalwarrior1977: lol
[1:54:01] sowercookie: The Jailer was also hinting about another big bad evil thing and how we don't get it. Iridikron was here to be the villain and owns it
[1:54:06] neverbornlucky: Taliesin but where does he rank on the donald trump of badie scale
[1:54:06] JMan31337: dwarves? they are rocks right
[1:54:07] SunnyAutumns: Dracthyr are mortals, that's the whole thing
[1:54:08] JoeTheRedcoat: If Iridikron was locked up, how does he know the players are badasses?
[1:54:09] SleepyNoodle_Z: The player is not a mortal, they just rez.
[1:54:10] Popicus: Earthen in the future?
[1:54:11] Katsutomai: Draenei can just live a LONG time.
[1:54:13] aurum2509: blood elves
[1:54:14] phritss: Very good point, Iridikron also, feels like he exist "in the world". The Jailer was always "outside" the world.
[1:54:17] Arlaeya: I've yet to see a good explanation of what "mortal" means in this game.. dracthyr have called me mortals. dragons die...but are not. lol. I think about this too much
[1:54:18] menzlo: Did NEs get immortality back with new tree blessing?
[1:54:19] RIckjamesx: they decompose eventually
[1:54:19] DiscordianKitty: in thousand years of war they mention blood elves are basically immortal
[1:54:22] Triskelian: No Tali, we're immortal because we can rez :D
[1:54:37] phritss: Seeing him bust out of a mountain just holds more weight than a guy sitting in the shadowlands.
[1:54:38] KanaCiCi: Earthen Forsaken 😂
[1:54:41] Clodagh_Lunaria: Clodagh_Lunaria subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! tneMovEEE
[1:54:42] BosakMaw: earthen racial will be petri petri petri
[1:54:45] T3ddyFr3ddy: haha
[1:54:50] CrossroadsDealer: you are so correct. it is crazy at this point t for anyone in the wow universe to not fear our player character. we have taken down all comers. we kill for pay. our player character is ruthless and dominating.
[1:55:01] sowercookie: Tbh he should've seen it with his future powers, skill issue
[1:55:10] Arlaeya: @CrossroadsDealer we nuked an Old God
[1:55:11] thunduz: Nathanos might be angry to hear that forsaken are not counted as mortal
[1:55:12] Clodagh_Lunaria: That side of twitter... is scary and full of nutcases xD
[1:55:13] magisterofquelthalas: Blood Elfs are mortals, we dont know if restoration of Sunwell regained them their immortality. i dunno if Nelfs regained it now?
[1:55:14] cabeshpash: still waiting for the war within predictions @TaliesinAndEvitel :)
[1:55:17] ryarose42: Tali, have you seen the dialogues about training new Wardens in Bel'Ameth? It makes me think we might get a Warden class in Midnight or the last titan
[1:55:21] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel  the manuscript of endless possibilities is kinda neat it gives you a toggle for dragon riding mount  customization
[1:55:29] T3ddyFr3ddy: @magisterofquelthalas Im immortal though :)
[1:55:29] Valinor55: Where is my "Champion of the Dragonflights" title by the way
[1:55:35] Triskelian: @thunduz <grumble> I hope Nathanos *stays* lost...
[1:55:36] Clodagh_Lunaria: They literally worry me lol
[1:55:40] DiscordianKitty: it's not account wide
[1:55:42] realGameTheory: yep lmao
[1:55:45] wuubzee: WE should be the nex baddies DarkMode
[1:55:47] KeyouiX: @Triskelian sAME
[1:55:49] SunnyAutumns: "These mortals have killed gods, titans and reality-defining monsters. Not me, tho. I'm built different." -WoW baddies
[1:55:53] DiscordianKitty: I only want it on my alts and it isn't account wide
[1:55:54] Davykuro: Hi Tali !! Sorry to ask (in the case it was said) Did you knew for Chronicle Vol 4 ?
[1:55:56] phritss: No
[1:55:56] Sch1ey: I hit random every week
[1:55:57] Sharktribe: useless
[1:55:58] SleepyNoodle_Z: Player characters are not mortal. When we can just rez after a wipe. So it is funny to me when they call us mortals.
[1:55:59] jeldin: you can toggle on off
[1:56:03] Lausten: Bug report it
[1:56:11] Nulgar: I recal that one exchange on Doctor Who: Baddie: "Fear me! I have killed hundreds of [spoiler]s!" Doctor: "Fear me, I've killed them all."
[1:56:11] jeldin: your dragon dont change when toggled off
[1:56:11] T3ddyFr3ddy: I say one of the new "bad" things in DF has been the dungeons, they are pretty shit :)
[1:56:14] Harai_Ulfsark: that must be a bug, a lot of account-wide stuff are broken this patch
[1:56:16] Synkronos: The only manuscript that isn't account wide? Does NOT sound intentional
[1:56:17] AlanC2024: With Iridikrons and Xalataths plans I think we will lose in one of the world soul saga's expacs
[1:56:22] DiscordianKitty: you can only toggle it on the character that  bought it
[1:56:26] phritss: Character bound.
[1:56:30] magisterofquelthalas: U forgot the one before Iridikron
[1:56:32] phritss: It isn't did it last night
[1:56:39] Teth33: You could argue that Garrosh was another villain that understood the threat of the player.
[1:56:39] magisterofquelthalas: Manuscript?
[1:56:43] Saumur: Finally LUL
[1:56:45] magstheghoul: Are player deaths considered canon though? In regards to whether or not we're mortal
[1:56:47] Saumur: Thanks, Tali
[1:56:51] T3ddyFr3ddy: Im pretty sure the story will be about a war within!
[1:56:58] Aerisot: "The Last Titan" seems to suggest that Iridikron wins
[1:56:59] amiciart: hi
[1:57:01] Thoreya: im more excited for Midnight than War Within lol
[1:57:08] butlerlog: @magstheghoul i feel like the game isnt sure itself at times
[1:57:10] Triskelian: I don't think we'll LOSE, but I think in Midnight we'll be handed some kind of setback
[1:57:17] sowercookie: Midnight sounds like a bad time
[1:57:26] Davykuro: I don't think so  because after the Nerubian I don't whats coming in the WW
[1:57:30] xaxxas_: detheroc in the war within is the real kicker
[1:57:31] SunnyAutumns: I saw a suspicious mountain. Iridikron?
[1:57:35] Saumur: @TaliesinAndEvitel Her Dreams Sing beneath the surface. Our Dreams. Our Song. - NZoth during the Chromie Timeline
[1:57:36] Mckhero: i think we are gonna lose
[1:57:39] DiscordianKitty: we definitely losing end of war within and i for one already blame it on the earthen allied race
[1:57:42] Frozen_DK: Patch 11.2.5: Afternoon
[1:57:44] pagan_pg: Plot Twist: Midnight is an expansion all about the mount from Karazahn
[1:57:44] Sorin__: xalatath must succeed for midnight to happen
[1:57:44] cabeshpash: @Saumur we got there eventually LUL
[1:57:46] Valshaw: People act like we never lost  in WoW but we lost the first 2 tiers of DF (Incarnates free, Sark successfully distracted us)
[1:57:50] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel i totaly get it I felt the same way so I got it on an alt incase it did anything crazy it's fun though if you want some veritaty and you can still use your curated dragon mounts
[1:57:57] wuubzee: I'd be nice to feel a proper defeat, will pay off with the next win
[1:57:58] T3ddyFr3ddy: Midnight will be about the war outside!
[1:58:05] Saumur: @cabeshpash As Good Ol' Nzoth would say: Patience, patience! :D
[1:58:09] snagprophet: The War Without
[1:58:11] AlanC2024: and we defend the sunwell since getting hands on that will be the end of us
[1:58:15] T3ddyFr3ddy: @snagprophet haha
[1:58:32] T3ddyFr3ddy: Maybe The War Without Cloths?
[1:58:33] cabeshpash: who do you think the cries from within the planet are coming from @TaliesinAndEvitel ?
[1:58:36] snagprophet: @snagprophet that's what we will call if it the expansion sucks
[1:58:39] Teth33: Crazy theory: War Within will give us our big light-aligned baddies. We defeat them, ushering in "Midnight", the rise of void supremacy in the cosmic balance.
[1:58:45] VytheZ: Where will the Light fit in, Midnight?
[1:58:55] maplelost: the world soul saga will redeem wows storytelling
[1:59:02] bucephalos: which role will the Arathi play?
[1:59:04] Triskelian: Unpopular opinion/theory time: Xal'atath will die, however Allreia will become fully corrupted
[1:59:05] databob1: I miss razz she was the best penguin queen ever
[1:59:12] cabeshpash: it would be very cool to end an expansion with the bad guys winning
[1:59:29] snagprophet: Iridikron will be our father and our hand will get cut off
[1:59:33] T3ddyFr3ddy: I hope Midnight will end with a win for the baddies so the last xpack will be about us hitting back and winning
[1:59:40] SleepyNoodle_Z: The War Within, sounds like it could be a internal conflict with Andiun too  and loses, Suprise, Midnight!
[1:59:45] phritss: What is the War within ends on a low note rather than a high note. That would explain the "Midnight" title. Something big like the end of Infinity War?
[1:59:55] snagprophet: Iridikron will pick up the Last Titan's villain and throw them down a hole
[2:00:02] KanaCiCi: the universe is so big but everyone wants the sunwell PikaRamen
[2:00:02] xaxxas_: 11.1: Undermine with Gallywix/Detheroc reveal. 11.2: Hallowfall Mereldar inner crystal raid as it goes void and shatters, matching the midnight logo
[2:00:11] Dinshara: hobsons choice
[2:00:16] cabeshpash: is the black empire part of the void ?
[2:00:21] T3ddyFr3ddy: Please no more Anduin swappy swapp. Just let the poor guy be and try to find his footing as a good guy
[2:00:35] Dinshara: also hello Taliesin
[2:00:46] Teth33: Since the void can see all possible outcomes, their alliance with Iridikron is a calculated risk.
[2:00:57] phritss: lol. So ture. You are on your A-game today.
[2:01:08] cabeshpash: this reminds me of the story in Loki
[2:01:18] Singhy: morchi says “you know what to do next” after you beat her
[2:01:31] Singhy: so they know too
[2:01:35] Sorin__: that's honestly a great point about the difference between the jailer's plan and iridikron's gambits
[2:01:50] T3ddyFr3ddy: Maybe we shall go back and stop SL from happening? We stop Sylvannas from breaking the lich kings crown :)
[2:01:51] cabeshpash: yup, that's on point
[2:01:56] Sorin__: iridikron is giving us the opportunity to stop him, but if we do, something else goes wrong
[2:02:10] T3ddyFr3ddy: after that, all proof of SL ever existed will be gone from wow :)
[2:02:28] snagprophet: I bet Iridikron will turn out to be merely a vessel
[2:02:50] Sharktribe: When storytelling, the greatest crime is to begin without an end in mind. That's why BFA/SL struggled, Afrasiabi was checked out and sabotaging the narrative.
[2:02:54] maulinx: you are getting me so hyped up
[2:02:55] Saumur: You mean, The Titans sucked Sargeras off, and Iridikron sucks the Titans in? Kappa
[2:02:55] Valinor55: then we have no hope left, and then enters Illidan with a guitar solo ready to save us all
[2:02:57] T3ddyFr3ddy: No, Iridikron is now in possession of a vessel...we just dont know what is in it yet
[2:02:58] Singhy: what?!?!
[2:02:59] snagprophet: HUH
[2:03:01] Sharktribe: This worldsoul saga is resolving that
[2:03:04] Biggiediaz: He what?
[2:03:06] KanaCiCi: illidan returns with his titan training like Goku in other world. LUL
[2:03:17] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[2:03:18] databob1: why do the titans get to have all the fun
[2:03:24] CeasiusPls: Harbringer of the succ
[2:03:26] Biggiediaz: Understood
[2:03:26] jaedd3680: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[2:03:28] Singhy: suck the soul out of Azeroth
[2:03:28] misterstimpak: Clap Cheers Tali, respect it.
[2:03:30] Arlaeya: Disclaimer: all phrasing is intentional
[2:03:34] Sockfire: it's the price we pay
[2:03:34] cabeshpash: iridikons onlyfans starting soon
[2:03:34] thunduz: worth
[2:03:39] T3ddyFr3ddy: Someone is a succubus today!
[2:03:50] RIckjamesx: but i fend them off
[2:03:52] RIckjamesx: everytime
[2:03:54] lideylei: have you seen the tv show Ghosts?
[2:03:55] HiddenSquid188: suck it off mate
[2:03:56] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel and the last titan alive is sargeras cause he was in the sword monkaS
[2:03:56] phritss: Gosh, if he sucks them all off. That would be epic.
[2:03:57] RIckjamesx: its not the first time a baddy has tried to suck me off
[2:04:10] ryarose42: Wild theory, but what if the Void is able to enter because of Alleria, and Sylvanas sacrifices herself to save Alleria (her third death), which heralds in their coming. But idk if they'll bring Sylvanas back that soon
[2:04:37] vtech310: ***HOT TAKE*** WE WIN expansion 1-2 we lose and warcraft ends and now we have wow 2 and all your shit is gone
[2:04:46] Whezyk_: Would be cool tho if 1 expac we lose
[2:04:46] vtech310: expansion #3
[2:04:49] Ndorfens: Spoilers?! Jeez
[2:04:51] phritss: Do you think Malfurion will play any part in the three expans?
[2:04:52] Teth33: I don't want to lose again. I feel like they keep on pulling the rug away at the end of each expac. Legion and DF are the only 2 I can remember that felt like we actually won something.
[2:04:53] Whezyk_: and then comebacl
[2:04:58] Sockfire: Midnight is going to end like that
[2:05:02] cabeshpash: do you think the old gods will be prominent in the war within @TaliesinAndEvitel ?
[2:05:06] Aerisot: Holy shit, This is the Star War Saga
[2:05:20] Promilie: Or Aman'Thul oneshots Iridikron right after we find out the titans plan to kill us all to birth Azeroth and we go "oh fuck"
[2:05:22] magisterofquelthalas: It is the all time low phase of his Hero's Journey @taliesinandevitel (ep.5)
[2:05:23] AlanC2024: if Iridikron kills the titans I wonder what he will do now
[2:05:25] RIckjamesx: maybe the new gods will finally appear
[2:05:27] snagprophet: there could be a Naaru involved  without being the villain
[2:05:28] xaxxas_: not as prominent as dreadlords
[2:05:28] Harai_Ulfsark: we're going underground, we'll probably have old gods
[2:05:33] Valinor55: We still have a plot thread of uniting the 6 cosmic powers via the Jailer at the end of SL
[2:05:36] tom_badil_: I see us fighting against the Titans and we are on the brink of losing it and then iridkron takes his chance and kills em off and dies with them, so he had his revenge and also was sort of a anti hero cuz he freed azeroth of Orders shackles
[2:05:37] Singhy: I think Azeroth is a light corrupted old good
[2:05:39] phritss: The light will play a role with Anduin. He will get his "light back".
[2:05:39] zeckzeckzeck: immigrants smh
[2:05:42] kameleon0728: THE VOID LORDS and ladies
[2:05:47] JoeTheRedcoat: If the Sunwell is involved in Midnight I can't imagine the light won't be involved in some way.
[2:05:50] goldengrubate: zombie old god council fight. all 4 of them at once!
[2:05:52] Aerisot: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, WoW: The Last Titan.
[2:05:55] KanaCiCi: Clone Wars 2.0 :)
[2:05:56] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel does wow do the "redemption arc" meme still? cause i could see all the titan's dying and "the last titan" being a redeemed sargeras to fight the void LUL
[2:06:12] databob1: they're drones? like birds
[2:06:17] Sharktribe: Tali did i miss you talking about the fixes/updates on the Gilnean nobility transmog they hotfixed? It looks good now.
[2:06:20] magisterofquelthalas: Old Gods are shotgun shells
[2:06:31] Teth33: I am convinced "The Last Titan" is Sargeras.
[2:06:40] Harai_Ulfsark: the guy that designed the cosmic void deserves a raise
[2:06:54] Triskelian: @magisterofquelthalas More like the buckshot inside the shells, imo
[2:06:57] Sorin__: since azeroth isn't a titan what is she?
[2:06:58] DiscordianKitty: I can't hear The Last Titan without thinking of The Last Jeid
[2:07:02] DiscordianKitty: *Jedi
[2:07:03] maplelost: classic wow subversion, Sargaras last titan, Azeroth a first one gg
[2:07:03] databob1: what about tyr?
[2:07:07] Teth33: It brings the lore full circle. The story of the universe started with him, it should end with him.
[2:07:11] Saumur: A First One
[2:07:13] shaymster: we are the last titan surprise
[2:07:16] Singhy: ilidan gets turned to a dragon and he and sargeras kiss
[2:07:19] Sharktribe: Sargeras is being saved for an Illidan return, they'll have worked out their beef and be ready to train all races to be DHs
[2:07:19] SpecialCrayons: Hey myff, you been playing much SoD?
[2:07:23] maplelost: sylvanas turns into a titan
[2:07:24] Aerisot: Could be Eonar, She seems the most fishy
[2:07:27] Harai_Ulfsark: azeroth is an eevee
[2:07:29] Dangeons_and_Dragons: Do you think anduin reclaims his throne?
[2:07:30] tom_badil_: @maplelost shes not the last but the first 👀
[2:07:34] KanaCiCi: Sargeras coming soon to my pet box 2026. PikaRamen
[2:07:41] vlaovich88: She is a stem cell
[2:07:46] magisterofquelthalas: @triskelian yeah l
[2:08:02] cabeshpash: that is an interesting parallel between them
[2:08:07] Valinor55: Azeroth has a lot mixed up in her by now from all the cosmic powers
[2:08:11] Sockfire: Weren't all the other titans world souls?
[2:08:28] Sorin__: in that case would her current magic be "reality" based?
[2:08:35] Sorin__: since it's not titan flavour
[2:08:43] dancingfalcon: The Last Titan as a title could mean something in the direction, that Azeroth could become a titan, but decides not to do and so she ends the creation of new titans?
[2:08:44] KanaCiCi: More titan daddies :0
[2:08:50] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel transcript of endless possibilities is not account wide ...RIP
[2:08:54] bucephalos: who turned aman thul into a titan then??
[2:08:54] MikeyGy: would explain the name ''FIRST ONES'' too, like first ones of each cosmicforce
[2:09:03] magisterofquelthalas: There is no difference,they are just natural forces of the warcraft universe. Can u blame a typhoon for ruining ur house?
[2:09:05] Singhy: I think the hero’s are the white blood cells of the world soul
[2:09:06] Sockfire: there's a chicken and egg problem here
[2:09:12] jandemain: are there any examples of void world souls
[2:09:13] Aerisot: @Sockfire Allegedly, according to their own words in chronicles.
[2:09:30] Singhy: we are born from the world soul to  protect it
[2:10:05] Saiyori: makes you wonder what other kinds of entities are out there that we don't know about
[2:10:22] Whezyk_: What ever they get infused with , yeah
[2:10:23] KanaCiCi: I think you have cracked the wow book. Back to the drawing board for them 🤭
[2:10:31] magisterofquelthalas: U think Void Lords are Void Titans?
[2:10:31] wanik90: I bet draenor would’ve been a life Titan
[2:10:48] Saiyori: @wanik90 maybe that's what elune is, a life world soul
[2:10:49] menzlo: World eggs need to be fertilized by space daddies
[2:11:08] MikeyGy: one of the last things Denuser said was that anima is of the element of spirit which is different and ties to Azeroth, its pure energy so it also fits this theory
[2:11:24] goldengrubate: Azeroth has unusually low spirit, because the world soul is sucking it all up
[2:11:32] Waxx90: she's captain planet
[2:11:35] goldengrubate: Draenor had unusually high spirit
[2:11:37] Solbiaa: That would explain Azuritre
[2:11:41] vimie: Thanos world soul
[2:11:45] Saumur: Maybe that is what makes a First One - Bringing together all the Cosmic Forces
[2:11:49] Valinor55: what if she is infused with all 6 equally?
[2:11:51] ryarose42: She's a reality world soul
[2:11:53] cabeshpash: @menzlo LUL LUL LUL
[2:11:56] Sockfire: So in that theory, who is The Last Titan?
[2:11:58] MikeyGy: the cinematic in raid kinda confirms azeroth isnt a titan yea
[2:11:59] vlaovich88: She also has been connected to the shadowlands
[2:12:07] Arlaeya: primal titan... forming a thought here but Vyranoth's comments about being an Aspect
[2:12:08] magisterofquelthalas: She is the AVATAR
[2:12:26] Frozen_DK: @magisterofquelthalas Rav would disagree xD
[2:12:27] Saiyori: links back into first ones nicely
[2:12:32] Sharktribe: Most world souls are STEM majors, but Azeroth wants to get a BFA
[2:12:38] vimie: so Azeroth is the Iron Throne from GoT
[2:12:40] Singhy: but it represents the same type of power
[2:12:52] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel I really liked the end cinimatic
[2:12:54] Solbiaa: What if it meant that they aren't a Titan "yet"
[2:13:04] MikeyGy: yea, Iridkron too says titans infected our world
[2:13:11] Aerisot: Azeroth is literally the embodiment of Dis-Order, she has so many different cosmic forces on her swaying her back and forth.
[2:13:19] vtech310: I think with that theory that the best result would be she has an understading of all magic and brings all of the different aspects or ***ath/light togeather
[2:13:22] Singhy: it’s like the unrefined version of the power that the titans use
[2:13:22] magemaster225: maybe its another galakrond size dragon improzoned like the primals
[2:13:28] sScottyKarate: Titan energy was the friends we made along the way.
[2:13:35] Rico_Azzarash: "This is no titan magic. This came from out world"
[2:13:37] magisterofquelthalas: It wasnt a well crafted cinematic :( but it literally confirmed Azeroth is not a titan
[2:13:38] Saiyori: imo, i think it's way cooler if she's not a titan. so much room for more storytelling
[2:13:41] Rico_Azzarash: *our
[2:13:43] DiscordianKitty: i've been saying she's not a titan for it's gotta be years now
[2:13:45] CeasiusPls: Or she could be THE only Titan
[2:13:46] tom_badil_: we never got more information about Azeroth consuming the Spirit Element other than causing the other elements into chaos. So i was thinking that also gave azeroth the abillity to comune with us and other beings on Azeroth(perhaps also to cosmic beings like Elune?) and to also protect us and infuse us with her power, as we are obv empowered by her over the Years. Hence The Chuckler was suprised that our connection with azeroth gave us the abillity to use First one keystones and such
[2:13:46] Singhy: like without the order taint
[2:13:55] Frozen_DK: what about illidan becomes a titan by being a jailer for them for so long ?
[2:14:00] goldengrubate: I can't wait for my character to start getting visions in the war within. Totally incapacitating me like Cortana visions in halo 3
[2:14:04] KanaCiCi: LUL
[2:14:45] databob1: they'll be too busy complaining about wow not being manly enough
[2:14:52] Arlaeya: I think them constantly reminding us about free will has a lot to do with the nature of Azeroth and what every other cosmic force wanted to do to change her.
[2:14:52] mydemoncat: i hope azeroth's visage wears a jean jacket and winged eyeliner and shes kinda tall
[2:15:04] tom_badil_: @databob1 naitanKEKW
[2:15:18] avatos_94: i always thought that the old gods were the original wild gods of azreoths spirit realm turned void
[2:15:21] JimothyOnline: Player housing
[2:15:39] Saumur: Pirates?! Kappa
[2:15:40] theDirtyon3: except for playable tuskars
[2:15:42] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[2:15:42] sScottyKarate: theory crafting just ends up being depressing. it's always better than the reality we get.
[2:15:44] DiscordianKitty: no player housing is bad writing
[2:15:55] Jenny_Tirall: @mydemoncat if thinks go well she can be a troll, so very tall
[2:15:57] ryanacheson1991: @taliesinandevitel crackpot theory but what if the last boss of the last titan is Azeroth who wants us to put her down to stop all the forces from coming after her
[2:15:58] magisterofquelthalas: Player Housing SHOULD happen pls :)
[2:16:01] onathehunter: onathehunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Heyo.  Goof afternoon from snowed in Buffalo, NY.
[2:16:01] realGameTheory: we canonically spend ridiculousl amounts of gold on rooms in Inns
[2:16:02] UrzakTV: Do you think the sword will disappear at the start of TWW to give us access underground, or is it a forever monument now.
[2:16:03] DiscordianKitty: lmao
[2:16:04] k3lz0: 2 hours until we reached "player housing" a new record
[2:16:04] Triskelian: @databob1 Speaking of, you missed a prime example of one in the poscast live chat yesterday
[2:16:19] Aerisot: Are you sure Tali? Player Housing could be tied to Order, and they can't have that until the conclusion of the titan storyline
[2:16:22] MikeyGy: some people going on their wack-a-doo theories and then being upset thats not the story when it happens is still kinda mindblowing
[2:16:24] the_howlermonkey: what if we get player housing, but you can only live inside of Tuskarr carcasses?
[2:16:32] Valshaw: They'd have to make player housing an instanced area
[2:16:36] Sorin__: could they have all been automatically "life" based worldsouls before being claimed by other forces
[2:16:43] Noznatation: Player housing would make blizzard sooo much money, that the reason they haven't made it yet must really be that it is very hard to implement :D
[2:16:46] kaguranne: @k3lz0 chat's the one's who brought it up too
[2:16:51] Saiyori: how could would a raid or dungeon be climbing up the sword to the top?
[2:16:58] databob1: but that's just a theory A WOW THEORY!!
[2:16:58] Saiyori: or even just a bboss fight
[2:17:07] onathehunter: do you think another titan will pull the sword out?
[2:17:11] dancingfalcon: The last titan will concentrate on Northrend, right?
[2:17:20] thunduz: is midnight a time travel expansion?
[2:17:24] NeeK_23: maybe another turtle island lol
[2:17:28] kaguranne: @thunduz no
[2:17:35] KingOfGainsDhaos: Azeroth isn't a Titan because of how particularly special she is to the entire universe/cosmos. That and power seems to be that not of any other sourse besides First Ones.
[2:17:39] Jenny_Tirall: Saurfang did warn us that nothing good comes from Silithus
[2:17:45] Saumur: "You will follow him to the deep places. The dark waters will flow in his wake" - Well and then there are "With many eyes they will see again. They will drink and be uplifted" - What other whispers will be solved in WW I wonder
[2:17:52] ryarose42: @taliesinandevitel have you seen the dialogue in Bel'Ameth about training new Wardens? Could be a new class in Midnight!
[2:18:06] Triskelian: @thunduz Not that I can recall from what was said at BlizzCon. I just remember saying that the Sunwell was going to be targeted
[2:18:19] ryarose42: Ooo that would be cool
[2:18:19] Sharktribe: Agreed
[2:18:24] maulinx: dh support spec
[2:18:26] maulinx: hehe
[2:18:27] kameleon0728: I want DH with bow spec
[2:18:29] Sharktribe: That or a bow/using DH
[2:18:38] xaxxas_: "follow him to the deep places" - gallywix/detheroc in Undermine, then Ko'byss in the final patch below mereldar
[2:18:40] Deatheran: dh support spec... STOP omfg stop
[2:18:42] Jenny_Tirall: Maiev will have a stroke
[2:18:42] onathehunter: I think it would be great for Azeroth to “hatch” and pull the sword out of her “shell”
[2:18:50] Solbiaa: I'd love a support melee spec
[2:18:50] Sharktribe: They do already use imprison, throw glaive, etc
[2:19:01] cutecupcakekittens: like dancer from FF
[2:19:03] Triskelian: @Jenny_Tirall Ikr? :D
[2:19:10] Raghoulash_: Warden could be like a Augmentation
[2:19:15] Jenny_Tirall: Fr
[2:19:17] Teth33: I think there is the design space in there after we get Hero specs
[2:19:27] Harai_Ulfsark: sadly i dont think they'll be doing more support specs
[2:19:33] thunduz: @Triskelian oooo I think I misunderstood Metzen when he said returning to the "Old World" lol
[2:19:36] tom_badil_: apropos new spec!: Did you clock that Tess greymane was labeled as "worgen Alchemist" when doing the Questline in Gilneas and looking at other Players Tess', that made me think EEEEEEEEEE perhaps a Rogue Alcemist spec comes in the future naitanKEKW
[2:19:37] bucephalos: As an undead demon hunter you wouldnt have to cut your eyes out xD
[2:19:45] Forrester_z: just give me night elf paladins and im happy
[2:19:46] Saiyori: dont crush my dreams for a bard class lol
[2:19:56] Triskelian: @thunduz Oh, gotcha! :D
[2:20:15] Harai_Ulfsark: rogue alchemist = assassination ConcernDoge
[2:20:17] butlerlog: i mean alchemist is already a thing isnt it
[2:20:18] CeasiusPls: full fluff alchemist
[2:20:18] Solbiaa: sad
[2:20:19] Deatheran: @Harai_Ulfsark how so? i think aug is a great success. its lowest DPS but has representation in group comps.
[2:20:22] maplelost: Evoker meta for life
[2:20:25] Sorin__: alchemy already being a thing would make calling a spec alchemist kinda weird
[2:20:33] menzlo: No plans for lunch, right?
[2:20:36] goldengrubate: Do you think we'll ever see what threat the jailer was worried about or do you think the negative reaction to it means it'll quietly be forgotten?
[2:20:36] dright424: the guy who made aug evoker left the company
[2:20:37] Saiyori: think they'll redo aug as a tank in the future?
[2:20:38] Solbiaa: I love Augvoker
[2:20:39] tom_badil_: @butlerlog nah we only have a WC3 hero which is a alcemist
[2:20:41] Uttv32: Feel like the light elemental transformation could be an incoming talent for holy priest?
[2:20:41] maulinx: do you think they pivoted because of the insane community reaction
[2:20:42] Saumur: I also believe Aug will be changed mechanicly later on
[2:20:47] DiscordianKitty: I'm so sad, I wanted bards
[2:20:48] jandemain: augmentation is a balancing nightmare
[2:20:49] Lenitas: I feel like part of the reason people don't like aug is *because* it's the only support spec
[2:20:52] MikeyGy: they would be such a cool tank
[2:20:54] Sharktribe: Augmentation is so cool
[2:20:55] Harai_Ulfsark: @Deatheran the main dev behind evokers and aug specifically left blizzard, and it doesnt appear it was a success for them from the interviews since then
[2:21:03] databob1: nope didn't like it hope they rework it even if it's dps
[2:21:06] RIckjamesx: i hope they
[2:21:10] butlerlog: @tom_badil_ i mean that its been a core profession since vanilla
[2:21:12] astralumi: isn't the thing people dislike about Augvoker the fact that it's kinda mandatory for high level content? wouldn't adding more support specs solve this?
[2:21:15] Thoreya: it also takes up a dps spot in groups
[2:21:21] Thoreya: like keys
[2:21:22] psychkenn1082: I really hope they do more support specs. I just think they are holding off until they figure out how to balance them properly.
[2:21:27] Saumur: #TaliesinWasRight
[2:21:29] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i think it would have been vastly different if they just allowed people to see the numbers in game LUL
[2:21:31] NeeK_23: alot of people dont like aug because they dont understand it and have been told its bad without trying it
[2:21:32] databob1: Taliesin was right
[2:21:37] Solbiaa: People just want to see dps number big
[2:21:37] thunduz: tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight
[2:21:37] maplelost: everyones playing augevoker ur wrong its clearly popular
[2:21:43] goldengrubate: Just don't touch enhance. I've seen too many people say to remake enhancement as a support. I'm enhancing myself dammit
[2:21:49] Rico_Azzarash: I am still looking forward BARD class xD
[2:21:50] DiscordianKitty: why don't people like it?
[2:21:51] Thoreya: @maplelost not really anymore
[2:21:54] Sorin__: people are playing it, but no one's playing WITH it
[2:21:56] Thoreya: on raiderio
[2:21:59] magisterofquelthalas: I think Aug was a pilot. I would like more variation to the concept
[2:22:02] Thoreya: this season
[2:22:10] Sharktribe: I want bards and tinkers
[2:22:14] kameleon0728: i hate aug cuz most of them are braindead boosted chars and they kicked me from the meta in s2
[2:22:14] Thoreya: it’s played but nowhere near as much
[2:22:22] menzlo: They nerfed it's damage but then they made the m+ season about surviving and not damage
[2:22:35] ryarose42: I think it's fun, but I think every evoker class is pretty fun,  the balancing is an issue though
[2:22:42] neverbornlucky: panda likes it
[2:22:43] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel certainly not mandatory this season tbf
[2:22:51] tom_badil_: @Sorin__ why? we only use it for simple potions not properly in fight, if you take a look at Pathfinder and other rpg games, Alchemist as class gives alot of options.
[2:22:53] Thoreya: I stopped playing my devastation since Aug came out
[2:22:56] Sharktribe: Tali do you think Evokers will use visages of other races (i.e. have other race possibilities) at some point?
[2:22:57] Valshaw: At the high end of keys (30ish) they are slowly swapping out Aug for more dps
[2:22:57] Saiyori: If they were to do more, it would change the comp to tank, heal, 2 dps, and 1 support but if they aren't, it sticks out weirdly
[2:23:01] Thoreya: sad
[2:23:04] Saumur: Imagine there were playable Tuskarr with only 1 class and only 1 Spec which is so overpowered, every group needed it - Players would love it, because of Tuskarr obviously, but every other species, its garbage Kappa
[2:23:05] kameleon0728: No it isnt
[2:23:08] tom_badil_: No it isnt
[2:23:09] Frozen_DK: maybe augmentation gets rolled out to more classes with the same abilities but different flavors  like what they did with covanant abilities now in 10.2.5 ?
[2:23:11] Harai_Ulfsark: i love my aug, i love the fantasy of being a black/bronze dragon hybrid, but i wish it was a tank instead, still i play aug only even in world content, its so tanky
[2:23:15] CrossroadsDealer: I like playing it but I hate Details. I get yelled at in dungeons and raids constantly because people dont understand it. I get told a suck as I boost everyone around me.
[2:23:19] Thoreya: it won’t be used in MDI. but in high keys it’ll be used
[2:23:26] tom_badil_: I did enough 20s without a augmention
[2:23:27] NeeK_23: for +25 sure for most people its not
[2:23:35] Lenitas: Nop actually it's really trash in highkeys now because of this reason
[2:23:35] tom_badil_: like dont give food into those tryhards who do 25-30 keys
[2:23:38] KanaCiCi: Can’t make new things bad so it has to be good somehow.
[2:23:42] menzlo: 20 is a low key
[2:23:46] Sorin__: hahaha
[2:23:48] kameleon0728: In current meta its middle ground
[2:23:50] Xithraldor: it is mandatory in the top keys tho
[2:23:53] Sorin__: especially on aug
[2:23:54] vtech310: 28+ is the actual keys
[2:23:56] dright424: I believe there is a certain key level aug is needed due to the defensives aug gives
[2:23:58] psychkenn1082: @Frozen_DK that'll be the only real way for them to balance it is to have the same major stat buff just different ways to juggle it
[2:24:00] SunnyAutumns: LMAO "I did 20's so it's not mandatory"
[2:24:06] SunnyAutumns: Dumbest take of the day
[2:24:07] Triskelian: Speaking of, when's Ani going to start tanking? :D
[2:24:11] k3lz0: You said "anyone can do a 20 in season 3# and I'm here, scared of tanking a +2
[2:24:11] Solbiaa: I'm still afraid to do 20s
[2:24:11] tom_badil_: @menzlo No it aint, its the same if you say Diamond in Starcraft is low level, just bc youre master? most players are gold-platin
[2:24:16] kameleon0728: Not pugging keys is cringe
[2:24:26] JMan31337: they need to just make bard because any class or race could be it
[2:24:30] Valinor55: ....i'm so bad at this game lol
[2:24:32] Harai_Ulfsark: aug is good until any mistake is a one shot, so they cant bring survivability anymore and they're not bringing more damage
[2:24:50] dancingfalcon: There is like ONE top tier team, thats running without Augvoker
[2:24:51] Noznatation: Think that depends on what you define as mandatory - for top 1% sure, for everyone else not.
[2:25:10] tom_badil_: Like just bc your perception of 20 is low doesnt mean it is, most ppl do 10-15s, now in DF its 14-17s bc of a affix less
[2:25:15] Tnawosaurus: Hello there, long time no see !
[2:25:16] Deatheran: id say it makes what ever key you do MUCH easier, but anything south of a 28 or 29 can get by without it and anything above it its mandatory cause of the tankyness
[2:25:19] kounsboi20: tali convince blizz to bring back corruption gear pls
[2:25:20] atamala: just like mage/rogue/priest was meta in 3v3 for years
[2:25:23] Lenitas: Aug is anti meta for high keys atm
[2:25:25] Xithraldor: you can go look on raider io in the top keys
[2:25:26] jandemain: ellesmere's team doesnt use aug
[2:25:26] Harai_Ulfsark: i think they'll rework aug as a tank eventually
[2:25:41] mydemoncat: my rankings of the titans (excluding azeroth): 1) Agrammar 2) Sargeras 3) Eonar 4) Golganeth 5) Khaz
[2:25:41] atamala: you could do other comps but the meta was higher
[2:25:45] mydemoncat: ah shit
[2:25:47] BrokenBohdi: I really like Aug, and love playing it, but without other support specs for people to get used to the idea of support and the intricacies of it....people aren't going to buy-in
[2:25:50] Xithraldor: @jandemain ellesmeres team is not really top
[2:25:51] goldengrubate: It is definitely meta. 40+ of the top 50 dungeons have an ***ere is a discussion of its viability happening right now because its been nerfed enough that having an aug is less group dps than having a 3rd dps. But it makes your tanks tankier and your healers heal better so it remains meta because the timers this season are so lenient.
[2:26:03] Noznatation: Well I agree it is the meta - but I think the balance is close enough atm that while it might be required for a 29 key, it isn't for a 28.
[2:26:03] Thoreya: jpcs team were doing high keys with 2 fire mages and rogue to get Aug off the meta group LUL
[2:26:05] magisterofquelthalas: Augmentation as a class concept i always loved, juet like how i enjoy playing pure enhancing Abathur, so too do i like Augmentation and it is the only class/spec rn that fill that specific spot
[2:26:08] JMan31337: there is a reason LotR used a 6 man party system
[2:26:12] KanaCiCi: I don’t like augmentation LUL
[2:26:44] butlerlog: game communities always revolve around the meta of the top 1% whether or not the people talking are a part of that 1% or not
[2:27:01] butlerlog: sorry i used "or not" twice lmao
[2:27:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I love shadow lands
[2:27:02] survhunterdream: should have been a tank
[2:27:08] JON3Sxd: Dragon race/class was just a pure failure
[2:27:10] menzlo: You need all tanky specs if no aug
[2:27:12] MikeyGy: theme is great, i'd love to dual-spec devastation and augif it was real dps
[2:27:14] Deatheran: i genuinely don't understand why some people have this weird visceral reaction to Aug
[2:27:32] bronioland: Whats up tali how u doin
[2:27:37] Cloudemon: Its also really annoying because it breaks logs and details so it makes comparing your performance in your raid just awful.
[2:27:42] bronioland: what we talkin bout guys?
[2:27:42] Deatheran: no no no not you @TaliesinAndEvitel  ive just seen stuff in other corners of the internet
[2:27:45] BrokenBohdi: it's a log issue...they need to be able to show aug contributions on details or recount. No one is going to Warcraft Logs to see how the aug voker did
[2:27:50] KanaCiCi: Yeah I think there is a two extreme majority also.
[2:27:59] magisterofquelthalas: I know i am not in the majority, enhance support class always gelled with me
[2:28:05] middleagerookie: Yea.. I blame the meters.. :)
[2:28:11] kaijoe_: Yet
[2:28:20] magisterofquelthalas: I want a mage version of the support role please
[2:28:22] RIckjamesx: thats a shame, shaking up the dungeon meta with more roles would be really cool
[2:28:30] MikeyGy: Tali do you have Augs in your guild raid group? if so do you as a healer feel the difference? just curious
[2:28:34] neverbornlucky: butt taliesin I love shadowlands
[2:28:35] goldengrubate: @magisterofquelthalas leave my spec alone >:(
[2:28:35] bronioland: we talking about alliance players?
[2:28:40] tom_badil_: @SunnyAutumns also its a difference if you do a 20 2 weeks into a Patch or 4 months. People really lose sight of the overall players just bc of their own progression, i only did 13s in Legion and then in SL i started doing 20s. I still know that thats a minority thing tho and i never experienced a issue with "augs mandatory" even 2 weeks into the Patch. Like dont let those few thousand ppl who do 25-30s appear as a majority. Just bc they have a huge voice on the Internet bc they are streamers.
[2:28:50] s7wede: The problem with Augmentation is that for the average person it's almost impossible to understand if the particular evoker in your group is bringing the party down or propping them up. It requires 3rd party apps to even know if they are doing the right things at the right times
[2:28:50] Merex760: It'll be interesting how they turn Aug into a dps sec, cause that's obviously gonna happen
[2:28:59] magisterofquelthalas: @goldengrubate i mean, it would be a 4th spec really
[2:29:01] JMan31337: is that why we are getting another Dwarf race because everyone loves Dwarves?
[2:29:09] Raghoulash_: I guess a third DH spec would have more ranged abilities
[2:29:14] menzlo: Ya
[2:29:16] Xulu_: As someone who likes Dev and Pres, Aug has had a really detrimental affect on my enjoyment of the class.
[2:29:19] dancingfalcon: They should rework some existing specs to be support as well, but that fucks with people, who like that specs right now...
[2:29:21] sScottyKarate: finding 5 people is hard enough
[2:29:27] elliongrey: True. The support role works really well in FFXIV, but it can be played by anyone
[2:29:32] Thoreya: @sscottykarate not this sdasonn
[2:29:33] goldengrubate: @magisterofquelthalas id rather see a 4th shaman spec be a tank
[2:29:33] Thoreya: season
[2:29:34] Nulgar: I'm confused why they didn't implement that _ingame_ damage meters could track the contribution of Augmentation - it's just numbers!
[2:29:38] Deatheran: it DID feel real good to have one "desgnated driver" player who would handle all the shit like dispells CC stops and kicks... the rest of us would just press our buttons lol
[2:29:41] neverbornlucky: butt taliesin I love shadowlands
[2:29:44] Krovig: whoa whoa you are making too much sense @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:29:48] CeasiusPls: also dracthyr is only mildly popular at best
[2:29:49] Sorin__: thematically enhancement would make a lot of sense to be a support spec, but I would hate that :D
[2:29:51] KanaCiCi: Oh Laowrd 🫢
[2:29:55] highlord1991: rip gladiator stance warrior
[2:29:58] magisterofquelthalas: @goldengrubate that would be awesome
[2:29:59] tom_badil_: @tom_badil_ so perhaps get a grip to reality, why does LoL have two new divisions nowdays? bc there are more bad players than good players but still diamond players will say theyre shit and now good even tho overall they are, so its bullshit to say that Augmention is mandatory to do proper keys just bc you and limit max think 20 is low and 30 is high lol
[2:30:04] Teth33: Tali's right. A lot of the other games that have had support roles used a 6 man strat for small group content.
[2:30:06] atamala: what we actually need is another dwarf allied race 100% no kap
[2:30:08] menzlo: People would just hate support instead of specifically aug, same problem
[2:30:09] Lenitas: Wouldn't even need to increase dungeon size, could have just done 1/1/1/2 but have multiple specs that can do it and it wouldn't have been as much of an issue
[2:30:15] elliongrey: @atamala LOOl
[2:30:16] sScottyKarate: @Thoreya  *Finding 5 decent players that can complete a key is hard enough
[2:30:21] KingOfGainsDhaos: I feel like WoW players who want the game to be more like Ff14 are to blame.
[2:30:26] JMan31337: I think we really need to expand on the Undead race like why are there not more then just humans by now
[2:30:32] Noznatation: But in a dungeon it is basicly a dps, just by boosting other peoples dps. So due to us having better balance today than 10 years ago it is fine atm. I like it fine.
[2:30:40] magisterofquelthalas: I guess support spec as an idea is too late for this f ed up community to accept
[2:30:43] SunnyAutumns: @Nulgar I hope you are joking, because the stupidity of that comment gave me an aneurysm.
[2:30:52] Cloudemon: I feel like in small groups the healer was the support spec
[2:30:57] butlerlog: i like dracthyr but they do have a bit of an uwu vibe which isnt going to be  for everyone, being forced to play that vibe of character to play a group role kinda sucks
[2:31:00] Nulgar: @JMan31337 yeah, at least High Elves... then again, we have enough Elf "races" clodagHeheheh
[2:31:10] Teth33: The only way I want WoW to be more like FF14 is to make damage meters and things like RaiderIO frowned upon.
[2:31:16] SerasVallo: as the only support spec it also has the problem that its either strong enough you always want it, or too weak compared to a dps
[2:31:27] maplelost: meta slaves ruining wow
[2:31:42] menzlo: That's every spec on the highest keys
[2:31:43] cabeshpash: @Teth33 damage meters are kinda necessary though, some people are legit dead weight
[2:31:49] Raghoulash_: Unless they made another DH spec like Disc  a shielding warden?
[2:31:50] SunnyAutumns: @Teth33 I frown upon the false purity mentality of FF14 players. That's the mind set of children and stupid people.
[2:31:54] JMcGhee559: highest level players will typically complain about whatever is meta / mandatory
[2:32:01] JMan31337: @Nulgar at this point it should be every race because of all the wars and plague that went around
[2:32:10] RIckjamesx: the biggest benefit i say of the aug is blizzard being willing to shake things up
[2:32:13] magisterofquelthalas: I understand that after a long time has passed around a community it calcifies, gets stuck
[2:32:16] Sanguinerd: would need a 6th dungeon spot, can't see that happening though
[2:32:16] thunduz: yeah they should have taken out one dps and added more support
[2:32:18] rawmins: There needs to be more than one spec
[2:32:23] ryarose42: I feel like it would be cool if we had it as a whole role with like a rogue bard, a mage enchanter, dh warden, maybe a paladin lightsmith like the hero talent tree
[2:32:24] Noznatation: I agree for top 1% they dislike it - but like the rest of us who just do a few mythic raid bosses and about 20 lvl m+ this season, it is alright and some of us like it - but sure, it seems many dislike it :)
[2:32:27] Nulgar: @SunnyAutumns about Augmentation's contribution being trackable ingame? Why not? Sure it's just a numbers game internally, Aug increases Vers and Mainstat, and you can calculate how much that increases a given attack.
[2:32:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin butt you aren't listen I loved Shadow Lands
[2:32:47] menzlo: No, people hate support, not aug
[2:32:58] maccaruso: Listen, I barely understand what I'm trying to say
[2:33:01] Deatheran: ao uhh yea sargeras is the last titan thoughts?
[2:33:01] rawmins: @menzlo no shot
[2:33:03] magisterofquelthalas: Ppl "hate" support?
[2:33:11] sScottyKarate: i'd play support. Warden/Bard would be fun
[2:33:12] butlerlog: and now the problems partially caused by there being only one support role are part of the cause for them not adding more support options
[2:33:26] SunnyAutumns: @Nulgar I lost any respect I ever had for you. Please, look up how the math works, I can't stand knowing that you are this dumb so I'll put you on ignore.
[2:33:29] cabeshpash: nah support could be fine, it's just not designed properly @menzlo
[2:33:32] Sharktribe: Do you think we will see Evokers gain access to more races at some point? i could see the lore be that now that they've met the other races, maybe some find themselves in aspect for of those races
[2:33:34] Harai_Ulfsark: @butlerlog they'll probably rework aug soon enough
[2:33:34] k3lz0: Thet there's the issue of some braindead groups kicking the aud because "doesn't do DPS"
[2:33:35] sScottyKarate: Details has projected damage for Aug.
[2:33:35] Atheridon: we need a dedicated support role and make dungeons 6 player based. and ofc we need more support classes: time for a bard class!
[2:33:46] Nulgar: @SunnyAutumns I think you may be vastly misunderstanding what I'm saying
[2:33:46] Harai_Ulfsark: @sScottyKarate it still sucks tho
[2:33:47] Pavo444: mid range cast distance feels bad as well
[2:33:52] menzlo: Support COULD be fine but it's not
[2:33:55] RIckjamesx: its not even close to accurate
[2:33:57] wanik90: even max was saying Aug has fucked up logs for everyone, no one knows how good they’re really doing anymore
[2:33:59] RIckjamesx: the details
[2:34:11] vtech310: YALL ARE JUST SPLITTING HAIRS ON THIS
[2:34:17] Nulgar: @SunnyAutumns like, you don't even address any point I'm making, you're just saying "that's dumb", so I'm gonna just disregard anything you said
[2:34:35] Atomicpanda: we're special
[2:34:41] KingOfGainsDhaos: That's true.
[2:34:42] TheDeekins: @TaliesinAndEvitel According to Maximum, the dev that was like, *the* aug evoker guy left the company when they eliminated remote work, it's why the hooks were never fixed
[2:34:45] maplelost: those are the real gigachads: the players that enjoy the game, ignore community
[2:34:54] sScottyKarate: agreed
[2:34:55] Belzaro: I have been wanting to get back into the game, but like I haven't touched it since BOA and there is so much to dive back into should I just play classic or jump into dragon flight?
[2:35:01] butlerlog: if your aug friend is doing really well do you know how well you are doing?
[2:35:02] Teth33: Support roles are only quantifiable by the direct effect they have on the groups they are in. A lot of time that can't be represented with a rating or number.
[2:35:17] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i played aug and i didint know for the longest time if i was doing well
[2:35:37] cabeshpash: dragonflight is a lot more fun the classic
[2:35:38] Noznatation: completely agree that our measurement addons and such needs to improve to help selling it as a thing.
[2:35:39] menzlo: Always good to get back in before a new exoac
[2:35:45] sScottyKarate: @butlerlog yess because the content you're doing becomes extremely easy.
[2:36:12] Vataraa: classic has its charm but retail have all of my 15+ years of playtime :P
[2:36:14] butlerlog: @sScottyKarate but is that you then or was it the aug was my point?
[2:36:25] maplelost: baffling they dont put like 10.1 quesat
[2:36:32] DrakesDark: Remember, at high level you can still go back to those old zones and do the quests, they\re still there!
[2:36:35] gachimane_: Im curious what the reail pop is compared to classic
[2:36:36] psychkenn1082: 1/1/1/2 comp is really only way to do it and make support mandatory, you'd have to allow at least 4 other specs tho
[2:36:39] gachimane_: retail
[2:36:47] sScottyKarate: I can tell my numbers are boosted. i can tell im surviving things i would normally die/take high damage to. yes i can tell
[2:36:52] Sharktribe: Dragonflight is amazing
[2:36:54] neverbornlucky: Taliesin am I strange cause I liked shadow lands ?
[2:36:57] Deatheran: @butlerlog going to be real honnest here if you are not doing well your aug aint doing well either. his damage is only ever good if yours is good
[2:36:59] funviking99: LUL LUL LUL
[2:37:13] Belzaro: If I don't have fun, Gonna come for ya Mr GM /Kappa
[2:37:16] Noznatation: deffo top 20
[2:37:19] Belzaro: Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:37:23] Vataraa: I think legion is better but DF is good
[2:37:23] zeckzeckzeck: 3rd best - legion and panda beat it for me
[2:37:24] kaguranne: @neverbornlucky rare at least
[2:37:30] databob1: I love dragon flying everywhere
[2:37:33] Finsby_: Dragonflight is good. But if you're not into the kind of game retail has become, you'll still not like it
[2:37:39] Finsby_: nothing is for everyine
[2:37:46] KingOfGainsDhaos: DF is the best Xpack since Wrath or Panda.
[2:37:52] funviking99: we will miss dragonflight, I had the most fun in this expansion than in any
[2:37:52] astralumi: we can tell, but it's hard to quantify
[2:38:01] tom_badil_: @Xithraldor ah so Chelsea and tottenham aint top bc theres City and Liverpool who are better? they are still some of the best naitanKEKW
[2:38:03] Valinor55: augmentation evoker is a stat stick
[2:38:08] zeckzeckzeck: enh, sort of. it's easy to see how much dps they're doing, but they might be terrible at mechanics/interrpts/etc
[2:38:27] MachoCham: @tom_badil_ Chelsea are a bad example this season PepeLaugh
[2:38:31] Teth33: The impact of Aug on the party is subjective.
[2:38:35] Deatheran: DF is the first expansion my guild raided all the raids and did m+ KSH on all the seasons
[2:38:41] Tmicrochip: I realyl wish WoW wasn't so ilvl/meter heavy culture. It really makes it rough for people to find groups when you need to out gear current content to get a group for current content basically....
[2:38:43] zeckzeckzeck: knowing if an aug is good is just as easy, tho
[2:38:43] CeasiusPls: Only solution is make dungeons 6 party members
[2:38:47] Harai_Ulfsark: i like playing my aug as i can help the group, here's a buff, here's a good defensive on a pretty short cooldown, here's a root, here are two knockbacks, let me deal with afflicted by myself healer, i got ya
[2:38:49] menzlo: You can't trust the meters or logs with aug
[2:39:00] cabeshpash: lol
[2:39:01] Belzaro: I mean standing in the fire gives me a buff
[2:39:05] Belzaro: and I refuse to move
[2:39:11] wanik90: tali is 100% right on this
[2:39:17] theDirtyon3: LMFAO
[2:39:18] Deatheran: @menzlo logs are 99% fixed now
[2:39:21] cabeshpash: bopping it LUL LUL LUL
[2:39:23] realGameTheory: Stare
[2:39:25] zeckzeckzeck: speaking personally, yes of course. if you're in 20+ keys, you know
[2:39:27] theDirtyon3: Stare
[2:39:35] picanhatv: im normally a tali contrarian on this chat, but there is no shot tali isnt 100% in the right here lmao
[2:39:37] Raghoulash_: STROKE MY THIGH!  LOL
[2:39:49] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:39:49] Solbiaa: I think you could tell just by the timings
[2:39:51] Triskelian: Stroking the "thigh"
[2:39:52] menzlo: 20 is low
[2:39:52] goldengrubate: @menzlo just wrong
[2:39:52] zeckzeckzeck: ok then, I know
[2:39:54] maplelost: but hes in 20 too so hes right
[2:39:55] Noznatation: I wouldn't say it is 100% as easy - but it is getting close I agree
[2:39:55] zeckzeckzeck: :)
[2:39:57] Sanguinerd: It gets even more confuising i raids for aug
[2:40:01] Deatheran: :)
[2:40:05] Synkronos: We need to get zeck to audit all of our dungeon runs personally from now on, rather than warcraftlogs
[2:40:08] s7wede: 0.3% of the wow playerbase is doing any keys above a 15
[2:40:14] maplelost: is he calling the streamer dumb
[2:40:18] gachimane_: is there a addon for it LUL
[2:40:21] s7wede: 0.2% above an 18
[2:40:28] zeckzeckzeck: off the top of my head, of course not. but if i look at logs, yes
[2:40:29] Teth33: You can't trust meters or logs with a lot of classes. I've seen folks with great DPS who have made it harder to complete content. I've seen healers with good IO and parses barely complete content.
[2:40:38] zeckzeckzeck: oh watching them play? yeah, probably
[2:40:39] astralumi: @zeckzeckzeck so like, if you run 5 dungeons with 5 different groups, each with a different augvoker, you can tell them in order from best to worst?
[2:40:42] maplelost: what are we looking at specifically
[2:40:42] zeckzeckzeck: harder without logs tho
[2:40:45] Noznatation: Can rank them by dps - as they are taking up a dps spot if nothiing else
[2:40:46] gachimane_: Just sim it LUL
[2:40:49] sScottyKarate: im just saying i notice a difference being in a group with a good augy as oppose to one with a bad augy. its noticeable.
[2:41:05] cabeshpash: this guy is trollin
[2:41:13] Thoreya: LUL LUL LUL
[2:41:14] menzlo: Credentialism is lame but Max says it's really hard to know how much dos they do.
[2:41:14] Harai_Ulfsark: its very hard to judge the performance of an aug in real time during a key
[2:41:20] Xulu_: You can tell whether they are using their utility at the right times etc and interrupting etc, but whether they are keeping Ebon Might and Prescience up perfectly is impossible just by looking in game.
[2:41:27] DarthTaz0: dude even Dratnos has said it's easier to sneak his rat Aug Evoker into high keys because nobody knows what their damage is supposed to look like.
[2:41:30] rawmins: If you look at logs you absolutely can, but that doesnt help the average player. It's terrible for an average player.
[2:41:45] Thoreya: one thing about augs I see in pugs tho, they die a lot lol
[2:41:46] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[2:41:47] RosieSeren: urgh I hate streams getting ruined by people being argumentative for no reason
[2:41:49] realGameTheory: LuL
[2:41:50] sScottyKarate: Hot take. Get rid of Details and recount as an addon.  ban them. they just cause toxicity.
[2:41:51] zeckzeckzeck: i mean, ok. i can only speak for myself. but i can't argue my personal experience with you
[2:41:53] drizzeh33: ROFL
[2:41:56] KanaCiCi: :(
[2:41:56] jandemain: log hooks are completely broken with aug anyway, so it's futile
[2:42:14] VytheZ: Regular dps you can just see on the dmg meter in game, shouldnt be a discussion lol
[2:42:16] magisterofquelthalas: I am still ok with the support class. Experimenting is required for a good dynamic game imo.
[2:42:18] RIckjamesx: i rate the augs in my group on their dragon transmog
[2:42:18] zeckzeckzeck: hmm, as easy is probably hyperbolic. but it's not _hard_
[2:42:19] theDirtyon3: no shot
[2:42:24] picanhatv: if the line is "its easy to tell by lookning at logs" means its not as easy to tell without logs, making it automatically harder then dps
[2:42:25] RosieSeren: I sometimes play aug for fun and I have no clue what is happening
[2:42:28] RIckjamesx: if it does not look good then they are not doing well
[2:42:30] theDirtyon3: KEKW

[2:44:49] sScottyKarate: wait
[2:44:52] zeckzeckzeck: but it's a fair approx
[2:44:54] nataliequay: They just need the attention.
[2:45:07] RosieSeren: because they want attention
[2:45:08] BloodyVVind: people who know how to define and prove their point of view will share the methrod/KPIs, but will not be saying 100+ times their unproven position LOL
[2:45:14] RIckjamesx: ive see nyellow apples too @TaliesinAndEvitel

[2:45:20] cabeshpash: contrarianism
[2:45:25] bab87: As you disagree....

[2:45:38] aurum2509: evi is just listening to this rant through the door
[2:45:44] Noznatation: It is fair to say that it is a lot easier to meassure now than it was at start of expansion, so the difference is a lot smaller now, and might become basicly nothing at some point.
[2:45:49] cabeshpash: I don't agree that people on the internet always disagree
[2:45:53] menzlo: No some people addicted to devils advocate
[2:45:57] persona_ghostwalker: Can we talk about how horrible the Gilneas questline was... What a joke.
[2:45:58] KanaCiCi: we have your back PokPikachu

[2:46:06] alanores: I see you have a red and black dragon tali, I disagree...
[2:46:07] KingOfGainsDhaos: I really hope that bit was clipped
[2:46:15] picanhatv: he was just being the most normal wow chatter, giving the most wrong take
[2:46:20] thunduz: Tali I have a lore question. Do you think The Darkheart has anything to do with Darkheart Thicket?
[2:46:21] Sharktribe: I liked the questline

[2:47:54] Harai_Ulfsark: at least they could have given us tails
[2:47:57] realGameTheory: 1000%
[2:48:01] hectorian01: I thought it was actually verrry good, i loved it
[2:48:07] realGameTheory: like a gradual unlock
[2:48:16] RIckjamesx: i would have made it similar to reclaiming suramar
[2:48:22] jandemain: that does sound resource intensive though
[2:48:23] JMan31337: taking back Gilneas should have been a mega dungeon or raid
[2:48:26] Jakeinator93: Jakeinator93 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:48:28] bronioland: @TaliesinAndEvitel watched Nobbel play through the last part of it and i was so lost. Was really excited when i saw the scarlets but i didnt really get what they were doing there. But yea although i jus saw the las part it really seemed kinda underwhelming
[2:48:29] DozlaT: Good idea rick
[2:48:36] Nulgar: if next week, WQs to support the rebuilding appear, you'll get comments that Blizz panicked and hotfixed them in
[2:48:55] persona_ghostwalker: The 5 mage of plague barrels hitting some sort of light barricade was very tone deaf, and Genn's so tired he's like.... Whatever.
[2:48:56] RosieSeren: I thought it was 'fine', I enjoyed it and think its more like a stepping stone, sort of moving charact6ers to the right places for future content
[2:49:00] bronioland: huh... so random
[2:49:07] persona_ghostwalker: Image....*
[2:49:12] bronioland: love seein scarlets tho
[2:49:12] butlerlog: they probably just wanted to remind us they exist for a scarlet storyline
[2:49:18] thunduz: Do you think the content we are getting is enough to hold us off until pre-patch dub dub?
[2:49:27] realGameTheory: sneaky undead rogues
[2:49:32] Deatheran: man afflicted this week is so anoyingly bugged lol
[2:49:34] bronioland: yea that sounds cool!  Like forsaken sylvanas loyalists
[2:49:34] Harai_Ulfsark: @bronioland it was mostly like a sequel to the forsaken heritage, weirdly enough, apparently they fight the scarlets coming back there and when the forsaken leave gilneas, the scarlets take over
[2:49:46] Sharktribe: Hey big lore gap we've never had adequately explained: Actual LEPERCHAUNS in vanilla Naxx
[2:49:50] bronioland: @Harai_Ulfsark strange
[2:49:57] cabeshpash: seems like a potential content drought to me
[2:49:59] DozlaT: 10.2.6 could be cool fingers crossed
[2:50:07] Valshaw: I prefer Fated over the nothing alternative
[2:50:15] RosieSeren: I missed shadowlands, was fated really bad?
[2:50:18] theszoti: shouldn't they announce 10.2.6 soon?
[2:50:18] kipleton: Fated seasons are not "canon" for me so I'll use that patch as a period to enjoy having completed an expansion for once
[2:50:19] butlerlog: or maybe the idea is the scarlets hate all who carry the taint of undeath, which is everyone really. but they'd see the forsaken and the worgen as the same
[2:50:20] cabeshpash: what is the vampire survivors thing?
[2:50:21] Synkronos: Fated season was a good emergency measure the first time it happened. It becoming a 'thing' now is _awful_
[2:50:22] maplelost: i cant believe how much ppl are expecting from a .2.6 pach
[2:50:38] Harai_Ulfsark: @RosieSeren fated was pretty good, specially considering the alternative: nothing
[2:50:45] bronioland: @Harai_Ulfsark feel like the alliance should have entered right after the forsaken left
[2:50:49] kipleton: Making us speculate = content
[2:50:56] OrganicJKW: Just tuning in, so apologies if this was covered, but how did a human turn into a light elemental in the Gilneas quest? Has that ever happened before?
[2:51:13] Ujopeto: Ujopeto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[2:51:20] BoomBerry: Do you miss 1 boss raids? I honestly thought that DF would have more dragon bosses.
[2:51:27] Harai_Ulfsark: @bronioland yeah like it appears to have occurred in a small timeframe since the scarlets didnt build anything there yet
[2:51:31] Sharktribe: omg this music is amazing
[2:51:34] maplelost: they got my month sub
[2:51:37] kipleton: Being hyped for patches lowkey as fun as actual patches HEHE
[2:51:46] Rico_Azzarash: now game sound seems like a bit too loud
[2:51:47] Pannekaker: Azure Span music is so good

[2:51:52] hectorian01: Gsaame tooo louddd
[2:51:52] elliongrey: Oh that's azure psan
[2:51:53] thunduz: player housing will keep me busy if they do it right
[2:52:00] DozlaT: Is that scarlet island still a thing in northern?
[2:52:00] Harai_Ulfsark: @elliongrey no its azure span music
[2:52:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you missed out on the ESO gold road announcement
[2:52:05] DozlaT: Northrend**
[2:52:05] elliongrey: @Harai_Ulfsark ahhh okkk

[2:52:25] KingOfGainsDhaos: *Identify Rocks* "Yup, it's a rock"
[2:52:29] bronioland: I thought they kinda introduced it?....
[2:52:33] Valshaw: I'd be fine withplayer housing as long as it doesnt come at the cost of other content
[2:52:36] bronioland: like player housing
[2:52:37] kipleton: There are two things I want in WoW: Player housing, and that blue dragon in Pandaria
[2:52:41] RosieSeren: Oh thank you!
[2:52:50] databob1: I ahve'nt even done the archive thing yet been having too much fun racing
[2:52:56] KanaCiCi: :)
[2:53:08] JMan31337: player housing would add loads of content and could even add a profession that's a expansion feature
[2:53:12] RosieSeren: <3
[2:53:16] thunduz: all the tattoo talk has been making me want one so I was actually looking for a shop the other day

[2:53:30] Pavo444: tneGo tneGo tneGo
[2:53:44] Gideon2826: Im offended for zack

[2:54:06] zeckzeckzeck: @Gideon2826 i appreciate you
[2:54:06] Rico_Azzarash: Once Tali will shout at me out loud! " STOP PRESSING BUTTONS RICO! GIVE OTHER HEALERS HAVE FUN! " XDDD
[2:54:09] KanaCiCi: Ragrets. 🤭
[2:54:10] thunduz: @Triskelian I have an unfinished sleeve so probably start with that lol
[2:54:29] Triskelian: @thunduz Nice!
[2:54:32] Teth33: You aren't a real T&E fan until Tali has yelled at you on stream at least once.
[2:54:33] zeckzeckzeck: do you have tattoos currently?
[2:55:07] KingOfGainsDhaos: Tali is one of the most reasonable and genuine people out there that stream. He really doesn't mean to offend anyone and if he does accidentally, he goes out of his way to say sorry. Which, cheers to that mate.
[2:55:19] Saumur: ... Which means, that at least one of your tattoos is probably older than me. Wow LUL
[2:55:21] butlerlog: you grew out of being a grown up
[2:55:22] thunduz: I need a giant T&E tat right next to my <3 or lower back. not sure which one is in the lead
[2:55:40] Rico_Azzarash: I think you deserve all the love mate
[2:55:43] KingOfGainsDhaos: You deserve them.
[2:56:10] Teth33: I thought someone said they got a shitshow tattoo a while back.
[2:56:12] kipleton: I'm getting one, I just need to come up with an alternate explanation as to what it means
[2:56:12] Synkronos: Rather just get an Evi tattoo LUL
[2:56:15] JMan31337: would be nice to see furniture crafting and they could even add logging in as a gathering
[2:56:18] Noznatation: Free crafting orders for life, for T&E tatoo
[2:56:27] Aerisot: But I want to be Internet famous for 15 minutes
[2:56:29] Harai_Ulfsark: i would love to get the druid symbol on one of my shoulders one day
[2:56:34] Triskelian: No offence to you Tali, but I'd be more likely to get a D20 than the T&E logo :D
[2:56:38] Traffius: I just realised you were at the same spot as me lol
[2:56:38] thunduz: good thing that wasn't said at blizzcon because 3 more of those japanese whiskey's and it would have been done right there lol
[2:56:48] Solbiaa: holy smoke, that looks popular
[2:56:51] Jakeinator93: We got a good dig site this time Tali
[2:56:56] elliongrey: How to get that rainbow trial for my character?
[2:57:03] thunduz: so good!
[2:57:07] KingOfGainsDhaos: Tali, as much of a dick head I can be, I have always respected you and the way you handle things. You're a good person. Only change for the better. Other than that don't change.
[2:57:08] elliongrey: trail*
[2:57:09] databob1: I kind of want a tattoo of the full metal alchemist transmutation circle like the one mustang uses
[2:57:23] Redmanpig: no booze in the con itself sucked though
[2:57:24] Jakeinator93: We got a an epic tome, DIG DIG DIG
[2:57:35] zeckzeckzeck: wish digs gave you specific tasks more often
[2:57:36] thunduz: nah I liked the marriott. Hilton was too much lol
[2:58:01] thunduz: and the fact tons of people seemed to have got covid there lol
[2:58:05] thunduz: oooo good point
[2:58:14] chief_hakoda_91: we can totally bring more hibiki
[2:58:28] Noznatation: They took the cooking public mini game, and made it more passive.
[2:58:28] kipleton: Blizzard balance events for Argent Dawn EU please
[2:58:30] Synkronos: To be fair, you are getting what it says on the tin. "Dig"
[2:58:40] Valshaw: the Hilton is a hive of scum and villainy
[2:58:42] Merex760: Marriot is better. No DJ LUL
[2:58:49] kaguranne: you got a task Tali
[2:59:14] thunduz: went to the hilton specifically to see this legendary DJ, they did not fail lol
[2:59:17] Valshaw: I passed Evi twice in the Marriott but enver said anything because I felt it would be awkward
[2:59:19] phritss: Don't talk about the Marriott. We don't want them all coming. lol
[2:59:27] kipleton: We can have jobs without it showing up on the UI! So if you see a big purple otter for example go kill it

[3:09:53] Rico_Azzarash: Like Factorio
[3:09:56] Rico_Azzarash: But in 3d
