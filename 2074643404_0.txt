[3:23:50] oakleafresin: ITS 100% LEFT AND RIGHT
[3:23:51] StreamElements: @JabbaTheChinchilla The keycaps usually have notches or markers to indicate their correct orientation The stem of the key switch also helps to align the keycap correctly - the larger side faces up and the smaller side down
[3:23:53] retau_: om
[3:23:54] natenailer89: LUL
[3:23:59] ChiefBeard: Just use the same orientation as the other keys.

[7:17:34] lootamah: which he has 800K subs
[7:17:35] AllieQuack: asmon completely ignored his successful youtube lol, to flame his twitch. asmon coping hard on his ego
[7:17:37] nz_jade: easy for asmon,   1. Play New Game 2. Complain about said Game 3. Profit
[7:17:44] Aisssey: @slesky teach me how to remember all health bars of enemies at all times, or even all enemies names so I can mind vision them. surely addons and wa’s that make that easier are bad right? you just want to play a slower game or are just so awful you don’t even understand why that’s important anyway
