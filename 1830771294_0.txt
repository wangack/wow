[0:20:47] regiiional: @flyingfishrobe where did you see this?
[0:21:09] k4bigon_: F
[0:21:13] flyingfishrobe: ***
[0:21:15] k4bigon_: level 40 death ouch
[0:21:37] flyingfishrobe: Guzu made a vid about the blue post
[0:21:51] flyingfishrobe: Check guzutv on YouTube
[0:22:12] Vendralos: Looking good Swifty
[0:23:02] flyingfishrobe: Yes guzutv
[0:23:41] regularbuff: Hey Swifty, glad to see you streaming again. I used to watch your warrior streams several years ago. You still wakeboard and do all those activities you used to do?
[0:24:07] flyingfishrobe: Latest blue post gives us more info on official hc is the title
[0:24:39] flyingfishrobe: Its from 4 days ago
[0:24:43] freddy_fazbearrr: no way they do that
[0:24:47] Vendralos: That would cause even more griefing
[0:25:13] fenriswolfsc: I think what he means is that there are specific hardcore servers but the rules hardcore players play by will depend on the person.
[0:25:15] IncinerateGaming: High guys FeelsGoodMan peepoHey
[0:25:16] ezscaping: Mak'gora SMOrc Clap
[0:25:25] Sdeleon159: I think he means in regards to rules like no trading or AH
[0:25:57] Spart4nm4n: swifty you see my text?
[0:26:00] Vendralos: Seems that way
[0:26:33] fenriswolfsc: yeah exactly. The version of hardcore you want to play is up to you. The only rule is: don't die
[0:27:07] kima_tochhawng: yep mitch also just loe the bet to xaryu cuz he turn off the addons to trade for 10 slot bag
[0:27:09] weahhc: no mailbox
[0:27:14] weahhc: no boost same dungeon each day
[0:27:35] coolcoolcool777dood: hey man do u plan to play an retail today?
[0:27:50] Feetuppercut: no addons
[0:27:55] Vendralos: I'd prefer once per day for dungeons
[0:27:58] ezscaping: people are here for the challenge. otherwise we'd jsut be playing regular classic
[0:28:01] fenriswolfsc: My worry is a fragmented player base. Going around in the world and having to inspect people just to see if you're allowed to play with them in dungeons.
[0:28:12] snipenright: Purists def gonna want to keep it the same. I think current rules should still apply
[0:28:36] weahhc: true
[0:30:06] Vansku: Vansku subscribed with Prime. 
[0:30:06] StreamElements: Vansku just subscribed PogChamp
[0:30:24] TedAFK: isnt there tokens??
[0:30:44] PaEu: I mean gold sellers will also be HC, so its gonna be so ahrd to even sell it
[0:30:51] Markfooz: people right now have level 1s buying off AH so basically they have RMT now on bloodsail
[0:31:07] jonathanezt: Yo Swift
[0:31:41] weahhc: Thanks blizzard to ruin the addonh
[0:31:42] weahhc: *hc
[0:31:59] Mecabeast: im ok with trading but no AH in hardcore is fine
[0:32:26] languini22: Fantasmas en Undercity
[0:32:31] Vendralos: The rules will need to be self imposed
[0:32:43] PaEu: I Think the HC with open trade and AH is gonna be so fun on release
[0:33:06] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:33:17] Vendralos: I agree
[0:33:17] horner70: ya
[0:33:18] gilbertmd666: I do
[0:33:42] Mecabeast: maybe if youre in group content you can trade but non-group you cant for self imposed rules?
[0:33:43] Holypally: Who made up that ridiculous rule?
[0:33:49] koenig369: I am okay with trading just remove AH
[0:33:53] PaEu: Bots will be almsot useless on HC since its permadeath. Bots die OFTEN, even the good ones
[0:34:22] avenomxx: if you can trade, what's the point of removing the AH?
[0:35:06] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:35:27] Spart4nm4n: @Swifty you see my phone text, summit is almost 60
[0:35:37] Liquidator_lol: yeah
[0:35:40] Starzx_BE: there wont be bots
[0:35:43] avenomxx: does your webcam follow wyou?
[0:35:44] horner70: nice that could be fun
[0:35:46] Vendralos: Grief the bots LUL
[0:36:05] MaxDeloren: Bots can get smart
[0:36:07] PaEu: Exaclty.. all these rules are only needed because the current server isnt perma death. When the official server is perma death all these problems are fixed
[0:36:19] Markfooz: they will just figure out how to not aggro mobs or attack previously aggroed
[0:36:23] Starzx_BE: I will kill them all
[0:36:55] blanketweeb96: excited to see swifty playing a mage
[0:37:02] avenomxx: you can pull a group of mobs and let it run back into the bot
[0:37:03] Liquidator_lol: hunt them down
[0:37:17] blixen: They should make it possible to use Auction house.. but only for level 60. They could make an ingame verification to put stuff on AH. And a daily max of how much you can sell on AH ?
[0:37:18] starinlys: blizzard shop revive xd
[0:37:27] grundwulf67: I think you're right, hardcore just gets rid of bots instantly lol
[0:37:36] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:38:08] Markfooz: as long as they can make money there will bots no matter how many people hunt them
[0:38:33] horner70: true\
[0:38:40] AlantinOrginal: Well Diablo had Hardcore for years eint it workin good ??
[0:38:44] horner70: yup

[0:39:25] Vendralos: LUL
[0:39:30] blixen: Just make it make it so you cant trade gold and epic items?
[0:39:37] languini22: Eso sería gracioso
[0:39:52] Myersfx: SWIFTY sup bro
[0:39:54] Markfooz: i think to risk your level 60 to kill a bot most people wont do that but sure there will be a few
[0:40:27] Broomba: this is becoming all too meta and oversaturated with soo many inputs that it will make it worthless
[0:41:07] Barimur1: the real hardcore feeling was over at the point  blizz decided to add official servers,the add worked so well at the beginning NotLikeThis
[0:41:36] Markfooz: blizzard isnt going to do any of this gonna be a normal classic era server with just no rez
[0:41:37] ShruniWasTaken: Solo self found
[0:41:37] grundwulf67: solo self-found, no trade.
[0:41:40] AlantinOrginal: Nice idea
[0:41:41] PaEu: ssf= solo self found
[0:41:54] languini22: From a scale of 1-10, how bad do you think the token being added to classic is?
[0:42:22] flyingfishrobe: Yea if they bother with changes at all
[0:43:06] C0DEXv2: i think its more fun to follow the rules
[0:43:09] PaEu: Well the rules are mostly there because the server doesnt force perma death. When perma death is forced on official HC all the problems will be solved. Bot dies? perma death. Griefer dies? perma death
[0:43:24] AlantinOrginal: I do think blizz do as in Diablo, Same rules  as normal, but if you die.. tuff luck
[0:44:27] flyingfishrobe: Hc community grew a lot recently but is it enough for them to invest to change game mechanics just for it?
[0:44:34] feefeebee: hello Swifty and chat!
[0:44:55] weahhc: Cool idea
[0:44:56] flyingfishrobe: mwayHey
[0:45:20] k4bigon_: They should do a prestige system where you hit 60 and start again, each prestige level up to 10 gives you even higher base stats
[0:45:28] Spart4nm4n: old school runescape has a system like that
[0:45:36] k4bigon_: and you get a cool emblem on your char profile window
[0:45:36] ezscaping: Thats not a bad idea
[0:45:48] languini22: yeah that's brilliant
[0:45:54] ezscaping: it's like runescape, you get to keep playing if hc dies but you lose your status
[0:45:54] Vargo_9: olaaaa swifty como estas?
[0:45:58] SlyceAsNyce: pergatory
[0:46:00] languini22: lets make it happen gente
[0:46:01] MaxDeloren: Blizzard will not do anything, laziness
[0:46:01] ezscaping: it worked for OSRS
[0:46:11] Spart4nm4n: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ironman_Mode @Swifty this is basically hardcore in runescape
[0:46:59] AlantinOrginal: Do he know how long it will take from Teldrasil to Gadgetsan if you cant fly ???
[0:47:15] AlantinOrginal: Its a 15min flight. And now you need to run
[0:47:31] AlantinOrginal: 30min to get from one place to  another
[0:47:48] ezscaping: you downgrade to an ironman or further, to a regular account but it still shows what you were at when you died on their high scores
[0:47:59] PaEu: It will be almost impossible to grief on the official
[0:48:31] AlantinOrginal: Anti gref, if you kill some one low your free for all for 3 days. PLAY TIME
[0:48:46] C0DEXv2: swifty u gonna play horde on official?
[0:48:47] Markfooz: i cant believe with a 15/mo sub there are not GMs in wow crazy
[0:48:51] PaEu: Because its perma death? Almost no one will lvl to 60 for 2 months and die after griefing one person
[0:49:18] Markfooz: there will absolutely be people leveling to 60 just to greif
[0:49:51] ezscaping: but the classic team isnt really making new content like it's a new expansion, they're just maintaining and modifying the game. I think maybe they could have some people do that
[0:49:53] k4bigon_: lvl 16 and still havent found a bag
[0:49:55] k4bigon_: RIP
[0:50:24] thedonmac: that field is where i found my very first epic in vanilla
[0:50:57] flyingfishrobe: Buy bags for 4 silvers from vendor?
[0:51:17] flyingfishrobe: Its small bags but eh

[2:34:11] meSeeb: in my town the arcade is 10 per 2 hrs, and 25/ all day
[2:34:12] OriginalSpud: at $10, it will be too crowded to play anything
[2:34:13] Parru030: you need alot of space, but take those, guys from the streets
[2:34:13] v1ta: i'd easily pay $20 for a all game pass

[2:35:29] MaxDeloren: Is it follows you when you go on kitchen?
[2:35:34] butcherxh: that camera is your second wife
[2:35:44] VIIIVIIIXCI: @Alisongreytwitch down bad
[2:35:58] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: It's learning eventually. It'll take over your place on the stream and have a webcam of its own and it itself would be playing world of Warcraft. There would be no need for Swifty. No need for streamer for camera is streamer
[2:36:01] Vividgamers: Does it reconize the face or the body movement?
[2:36:04] Deathleta: LUL 󠀀

[2:37:04] Vividgamers: Oh wait.. I thought you were gonna try and get appealed for that death..
[2:37:10] Cowardpatty: People's attention spans are already less than ever, I don't need to get addicted to shorts.
[2:37:22] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Supposedly now meta is saying they're working from adding artificial intelligence to AI and non-player characters. At least they're in the works of it

[2:56:08] mercilesself: u are lvl 12 :D relaax
[2:56:08] Anoffday: warrior is one of the hardest ones for it too right
[2:56:36] VanillaPuddings: hopefully we can group up in official
[2:56:36] OGSceneBoy: Warriors are so hard to level yeah
[2:56:47] Cowardpatty: You should try hunter.  Easily the easiest
[2:57:34] OGSceneBoy: Yeah I like hunters, but I like AoE farming more lol
[2:57:53] Capnrein: you are gonna be so disappointed when you cant pvp on your HC lol
[2:57:54] Tripnbunz: they should just  get a lower level pet and just train it up
[2:57:54] kruxxqt: @swifty these are the percentages of hitting 60 per class in hardcore 1. Mage @ 1.55% 2. Paladin @ 1.50% 3. Druid 1.48% 4. Warrior 1.40% 5. Priest 1.39% 6. Hunter 1.24% 7. Shaman 1.15% 8. Rogue 1.10% 9. Warlock 0.84%
[2:57:59] OGSceneBoy: Hardcore PvPing?
[2:58:06] Fressk: you can die from bleeds
[2:58:08] insectplato: have you eve rplayed mage on retail?
[2:58:18] Thorxs: record they might remove afking out of bgs to stop that type of play? might be considered griefing?
[2:58:33] Capnrein: I just dont want you to get your hopes up :(
[2:58:58] VanillaPuddings: solo self found is so different from HC, a lot of people just want regular HC
[2:59:08] Pr1m0x21: @insectplato yes
[2:59:13] Martylang: yea most likeley but I think blizz will implement a bit more though I REALLy hope they put hc challenges/achievements
[2:59:23] brianlawl: tbh i think they will add stuff to the servers
[2:59:24] Rugguggla93: Hc should only be for pve
[2:59:27] brianlawl: so u wont need the addon
[2:59:39] el_pipe_twitch: when you die in hc pvp you can ress only after 3 days LUL
[2:59:41] butcherxh: so on official servers PVP (Death)=delete?
[2:59:44] Grimaxt: what kind of cool webcam is that?
[2:59:52] brianlawl: ya and i think thats what will happen, u wont need it i bet
[2:59:56] Beastafied: u know how much grief there be in hardcore. if! they enabled pvp for it. So, I hope they don't.
[2:59:57] pedropabloqt: they dont want addons
[2:59:59] AlantinOrginal: Dont think blizz will remove any thing
[2:59:59] Thorxs: record they might remove afking out of bgs to stop that type of play? might be considered griefing?
[3:00:43] brianlawl: i think they will bake it into the server, otherwise why even do HC servers lol
[3:01:08] Thorxs: as signing up for BG is saying u are willing tro PVP if u cantr get a single kill cos everyone afk, its pointless
[3:01:18] Capnrein: if they cared that much about griefing in bg's, wrath wouldnt be 50% DK bots right now
[3:02:39] Martylang: nah they says hc server specific
[3:02:45] Martylang: everyone will be hc
[3:03:04] Chrimz_: Well they could add a new tab for just HC at the bottom and not in classic era
[3:03:06] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:03:08] ezscaping: they should make it option #1 where they play on the same server as others so that it brings life back into regular classic wow. The only problem is griefing so they'll have to do something about that

[3:05:35] Naypalmm: I shook your hands once in 2011
[3:05:39] Tomoglaziat: it does i belive but its a private server
[3:05:46] neevir: it's one of those illegal servers
[3:05:51] Encarved: u died???
[3:06:45] Encarved: can someone drop clip of death?
[3:07:02] xmedpakx: if pvp is left enabled for hardcore and there are people who chose not to do hardcore it will prove to be a major problem
[3:07:07] butcherxh: kill birds
[3:07:10] lillatidah: In hc Blizzard even said they are tossing around a pvp option of fight to the death.
[3:07:36] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:08:15] DyeAgonal: If blizz did combined HC/SC servers they could just make HC a buff so that only people tagged as HC could fight HC yeah? At least for World PvP. That would help prevent trolls imo
[3:08:27] Tomoglaziat: mokgora
[3:08:30] OGSceneBoy: Hell yeah
[3:08:38] xmedpakx: seems best option would be to have two servers for HC, one pvp and one no pvp
[3:08:41] OOseven: no

[3:44:10] Dimitrios90: xD
[3:44:26] Liquidator_lol: enchanting isnt worth it
[3:44:40] Cowardpatty: Use that one
[3:44:46] BossBuzz: stick with your current professions until you can make a greater wand maybe? its around 17.6 dps
[3:44:49] biggietalls: you cant get a rod in hardcore so its pointless
[3:44:52] nordicbeasts: ohhh no what happened to the other mage?
[3:45:19] thornclaw80: I told you not to drop your other profession lol now  your not gonna be able to make potions
[3:46:46] jim_wilson68: lvl 13 wand is like 17.1 dps
[3:47:09] nordicbeasts: are you doing the aoe build?
[3:47:25] BossBuzz: tailoring would be good, make a brown linen robe and disenchant that. you might have to grind some linen
[3:47:53] sneaks_15: whats best professions for mage pre 20?
[3:48:26] sunlitebro: im playing deep arcane to try it
[3:48:26] BossBuzz: You could also commit to tailoring long term, to make the +frost daamage armor
[3:48:48] oup3r: Hi sir, what happened to your studio? From where are you streaming?
[3:49:08] jim_wilson68: lvl 13 wand 22-41 arcane 17.50 dps ;-)
[3:49:11] Sp3ctralPh0enix: Best profession for hardcore is engineering
[3:49:43] Vorquo: bless you
[3:49:44] Galdrena: bless you
[3:49:44] jim_wilson68: have to be lvl 100 enchanting though
[3:50:20] greygem: its not really a problem as you will outlevel the minor healing potions way before you use them all u0
[3:50:52] BossBuzz: keep tailoring for bags and +frost damage gear, pick up skinning to pair with tailoring and for gold, its not bad, i did that on my mage :)
[3:50:56] clammer: on my priest I started as enchanting/tailoring to get the 2nd wand and then left both to go herb/alch
[3:50:56] VectorDave: What happens when someone baits an endgame elite to a major city? Like they did in vanilla
[3:51:11] Terminalbandoh: DOnt think the wand is worth it
[3:51:30] Liquidator_lol: fishing is so good in classic

[3:52:24] sunlitebro: stranglethorn fishing is dangerous
[3:52:29] tot4l_r4mp4ge: Yea @oup3r , I 2nd that… what happened to the previous setup???…
[3:52:30] Aruze2014: We dont mind watching u fishing man
[3:52:39] clammer: @Terminalbandoh when you cant get a wand from a quest until your mid 20's and you're only allowed one run of each dungeon, youll be without a wand for ages ... and a priest, wand spec is a real thing
[3:52:47] greygem: yeah we do :P
[3:52:59] sneaks_15: feel like you would get distracted and die
[3:53:00] sneaks_15: lol
[3:53:06] lahuskie: thats life
[3:53:16] Liquidator_lol: just dont die Kappa
[3:53:22] Terminalbandoh: Yes but he is on a mage not a priest
[3:53:27] Aruze2014: well if u rush things u can die too, and i spent 20 days ingame from 1-60 hardcore warrior, stopped doing quest at lvl 37
[3:53:28] lahuskie: lifes not fair
[3:53:37] Whitemamba236: "Let me show you how easy it is to die" lol
[3:53:39] lahuskie: yes
[3:53:41] Terminalbandoh: What I am saying for mage its not worth it doing all that and switching proff for it
[3:53:58] lahuskie: 19
[3:53:59] sunlitebro: LUL
[3:54:02] flyingfishrobe: we have to make the leveling journey itself the goal - you have to be able to enjoy the journey, if its just about getting 60 you lose the fun
[3:54:04] Galdrena: 19
[3:54:05] OOseven: 19
[3:54:05] thedonmac: 19
[3:54:43] clammer: what did it say killed you in your log?
[3:55:14] Mecabeast: are they like the invisible ghosts in duskwood?
[3:55:46] clammer: something had to have killed you, cuz you were dazed, then you died so it was 2 hits
[3:56:04] warcraft3exe: isnt that a bug if dont register anything

[4:00:16] feherlofia123: Kekw

[4:01:42] SkullyJake: but i have to LUL
[4:01:46] feherlofia123: @starfalix paladins are fun i agree
[4:01:50] Terminalbandoh: ! litre of water before coffee
[4:01:51] Sunglassestony: I generally wait 2-3 hours,
[4:01:55] biingb0ng: I tried that out and it actually worked crazy
[4:01:58] Guffnar: Yea just the one cup when I’m sitting at my desk. If I recall it’s bad for teeth but good for kidneys
[4:02:05] Aruze2014: thats great advice :)
[4:02:38] biingb0ng: I usually crash at like 2pm if I drink water and not coffee until I get to work im fine but coffee feels so right first thing
[4:02:39] Sunglassestony: It's a shock to the system
[4:02:59] LegoEngineer: it's because you will need to poop before you can finish your breakfast ;D
