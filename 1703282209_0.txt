[3:34:01] SSD511_: No impossible to ban
[3:34:13] kaoticbacon: Players who leave excessively will be subject to account review and suspensions, as abandoning matches repeatedly is a violation of the terms of service via exploiting functionality to the detriment of the game environment and the intended player experience.
[3:34:13] mikelewow: true..they should give to all the players win for the remaining rounds
[3:34:20] kaoticbacon: from blue post
[3:34:34] Kreds: its for people that keep leaving, probably a tracker on how many Solo shuffles you leave and then receive a ban after x amount

[3:39:22] Blitzylive: not dragonflight
[3:39:30] MalafisTV: @mikelewow they aren't talking permanent ban. They are saying soft ban them from ranked for a period of time. Usually developers increase that amount t of time with each ban. pretty common practice with competitive games/modes.

[5:31:33] KTwoCrank: For pally

[5:34:19] MrSecure94: Hey man, did you get what you wanted from the vault?
[5:34:20] 187prooof: Murloc lives matter
[5:34:33] 7thSaga: i believe Blood DK's are considered dps now

[5:38:30] sauroun: i mean if the holy is queueing normally or is this the new meta and the holy is forgotten
[5:38:48] Silvestina: Not enough that tanks do so much damage, now some are considered healers cause their heals are too powerful. Playing a prot pala is now a 3 in 1.
[5:39:25] tonypooplee: is that gaming pc in a box
[5:39:35] Silvestina: Why not just use a laptop lol
[5:39:41] Hasoufel: hey swifty . u used to play pvp with a guy called seanbon45.  he was feral druid ,but haven't seen him for over a year . what happened to him ?
