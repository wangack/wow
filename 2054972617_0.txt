[0:05:09] Maqooz: anyone else being sued cause they choke out drunk rats next to their white lambo? what a day man...
[0:05:11] GilbertGilberto: @heygoditsme i mean this guy makes all the poorest decisions (including his vid) but you dont fuck up a guy under the influence like that
[0:05:11] YuraruY: @141jinji apparently he provoked him but he was drunk and high so idk
[0:05:23] Xzanelol: mitch was high and drunk let's not act like he got randomly attacked
[0:05:24] sankaow: @Flatilius its still aggravated assault

[0:05:56] heygoditsme: dont assume things
[0:06:00] Xzanelol: @alex_klutch yes but it could be self defense
[0:06:06] classygamer17: the steroids Miz is taking made him take it out on Mitch
[0:06:07] YuraruY: @Pixiepantss watch the vid i linked for context
[0:06:09] paulieepaull2: Press 1 if you would LOVE xaryu to participate in a low maintenance tournament one day
[0:06:13] heygoditsme: this footage smells like bs
[0:06:19] paranoia_gamer: Mitch forgot to nova and blink.

[0:06:51] PocketLotion: Mitch on drugs?
[0:06:52] heygoditsme: and edited
[0:06:54] classygamer17: Mitch should press charges on him
[0:06:54] NenyioXz: Reckful would have never allowed this to happen.
[0:06:54] Magottx: mitch makes another big streamer friend hate him imagein that... id stay far clear of this dude xar
[0:07:01] Pixiepantss: oh man...
[0:07:05] Xzanelol: I'm curious why he didn't just share the whole footage tho
[0:07:07] 141jinji: ok i saw the vid
[0:07:15] eygton: how can someone’s random door bell came, with a doctors note be bs?
[0:07:15] YuraruY: yea the footage is edited and chopped bc u cant show that type of violence on youtube, is stupid ppl are making conclusions bc he took out that part
[0:07:15] Twitchswag2k15: Mizkif on roids thinks he a tough guy now
[0:07:18] heygoditsme: @Xzanelol because he started it probably
[0:07:20] Pixiepantss: it was not a car accident ayy
[0:07:23] smoothkeyz4: why would blizz allow you to lose rating becuz of realm reset? we didnt leave they logged us out
[0:07:29] paulieepaull2: which year did everyone in the live discover xaryu???? 2019 here
[0:07:42] Flatilius: I mean it doesn't matter if we started it or not - you can't beat  the shit out of someone - somethings got to be wrong with you if you do
[0:07:49] Flatilius: he*
[0:07:56] YuraruY: @Flatilius definetly
[0:07:56] heygoditsme: lol
[0:08:03] StreamElements: @aleuzraz, aleuzraz has been following xaryu for  6 years 1 month 21 days 8 hours
[0:08:10] duckyduker: @YuraruY There's multiple videoes of people dying on yt and how to put on a condom bad take
[0:08:22] ddevillax: i hope mitch gets better... mizkif really an asshole
[0:08:23] eyah: @MitchJones yo
[0:08:32] eygton: you have freedom of speech you don’t have freedom to hurt someone bc they are talking shit to ya
[0:08:36] paulieepaull2: do any mouses work good without a mouse pad? and useable on a wooden desk? I don’t like pads
[0:08:38] YuraruY: @duckyduker yea on 0 subscriber channels with no reach in the algorythm great take
[0:08:46] copper_cloud: was that damage from when he "ran into a tree"
[0:08:48] PocketLotion: Mitch always some drama
[0:08:53] boveylol: damn didn't know miz was a real one
[0:08:53] YuraruY: @copper_cloud yea
[0:08:57] duckyduker: @YuraruY No legit with 1000 of views
[0:09:05] heygoditsme: @Flatilius bro, 2 bruises and beating the shit out of him is not the same
[0:09:05] Kelthaden: @PocketLotion assault and battery isnt drama tho?
[0:09:07] classygamer17: @eygton exactly Miz needs to have self control and not beat him up. The steroids got got to him
[0:09:07] Erbsosa: ill waffle stomp mizkifs jaw into a curb for mitch
[0:09:07] W0odie: he could have blurred the video
[0:09:07] Xzanelol: @yuraruy what are you on about, there's plenty of fights on yt lmao
[0:09:08] duckyduker: Look it up
[0:09:08] 141jinji: situation is sad asf
[0:09:22] copper_cloud: mitch kinda low t for saying all that
[0:09:24] FelipeLLs: esfandPains
[0:09:32] copper_cloud: real men duke it out and let it be done...
[0:09:32] Acework: Why he hiding so much details he deff asked for it
[0:09:41] Pixiepantss: dont even talk about it friends <3
[0:09:42] Erbsosa: wheres the vid
[0:09:43] sankaow: @heygoditsme dude put up his doctors report he had a fucked up spine and a concussion not just bruises
[0:09:47] paulieepaull2: who did you all discover first. xaryu, Mitch, or pika?????
[0:09:51] MysoreMango: I missed the drama, where can I catch up on it lol
[0:09:54] simpenn_: @Erbsosa mitchs yt
[0:09:56] ItsGrez: Personally i think showing clips is fishy compared to releasing full video
[0:09:56] neonloon: "You said you could take me!" Tren brain LUL
[0:10:03] 141jinji: idk man mitch seems not decent to me
[0:10:05] PocketLotion: lol good luck getting people to not talk about it
[0:10:09] thisisgoodcontent: nah it kinda seems like mitch instigated it
[0:10:11] Magottx: bro if you go to the doc and say somethign hurts but they find nothing they say its sprained. which his record says for everythign
[0:10:12] Acework: @sankaow thats complicated wording for assbeat
[0:10:14] iamthevarg: imagine xar's reaction to this chat rn
[0:10:19] Erbsosa: miz needs his ass beat
[0:10:21] HunterericTV: hes not gonna post real time footage on youtube lmao, he simply cant i think
[0:10:23] sankaow: @Acework yeah
[0:10:27] auk5: @iamthevarg yeah sketch
[0:10:31] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: you cant post physical assault footage on youtube lol
[0:10:32] iamthevarg: monkaW
[0:10:34] YuraruY: @thisisgoodcontent so what, he was drunk and on drugs, if ur in that situation u dont beat the shit out of that person
[0:10:34] Xzanelol: NotLikeThis xar 2mins into stream
[0:10:34] tylive52: wow i thought you were trolling about that mitch video sheesh
[0:10:37] skez_live: well this is going to be a drama filled day
[0:10:43] boveylol: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany you absolutely can wtf lol
[0:10:47] SoCal_Badfish: Knew it wasnt a "car accident"
[0:10:47] inspect4: yall are grown men gossipin on other grown up men fighting on coke cmon drop it
[0:10:52] PocketLotion: this has nothing to do with xar
[0:10:52] thisisgoodcontent: @YuraruY unless that person starts attacking you first lol
[0:10:53] ilythumper: saw the vid and instantly came here
[0:10:58] eyah: xar is chatgpting his response as we speak
[0:11:02] paulieepaull2: do you think xaryu would be rusty at 3s? or pick it up really fast again if he tried it
[0:11:02] neonloon: @inspect4 I'm at work and bored
[0:11:07] Twitchswag2k15: drama aside how do you beat up your friend like that thats crazy to me
[0:11:08] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: @boveylol straight from youtube tos: "Note that we do not allow the following kinds of content even if there's educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context provided: Violent physical sexual assaults (video, still imagery, or audio)."
[0:11:16] Magottx: I just hope Xar cuts mitch out man.. nobody makes it out of this guys friendships free
[0:11:26] classygamer17: I see homeless people and crazy people talk crap to people. Doesn't mean u should beat them up because they are on drugs . You simply walk away
[0:11:27] copper_cloud: @Twitchswag2k15 drugs can make you act stupid
[0:11:28] Xzanelol: @magottx fax
[0:11:34] Acework: i am 100% sure without a doubt in my mind he asked for it. The question is was is valid to beat up a scrawny rat man? We dont know what Mitch said or did
[0:11:36] HunterericTV: mitchs close friends probably knew months ago anyway
[0:11:37] Phrosted_: letusin.gif
[0:11:38] Gluttoni: don’t do drugs kids
[0:11:42] inspect4: @neonloon surely there is something more interesting than 2 random ppl fighting on drugs :D
[0:11:47] boveylol: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany how are there literal thousands of videos of people getting assaulted or driven over?
[0:11:49] copper_cloud: nah sometimes people on drugs act hella crazy and need an ass whoopin
[0:11:57] paulieepaull2: what happened with Mitch? I wasn’t paying attention
[0:11:58] sankaow: @Magottx doubt xar would get into any kind of drama
[0:12:00] copper_cloud: the embarassment alone should deter that person from using again
[0:12:00] neonloon: Is Texas mutual combat?
[0:12:03] eyepod: eyepod subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:12:03] stankylank: @Acework that's the thing though, you can't be sure.
[0:12:09] eyah: @sankaow agreed
[0:12:13] eygton: ace work, are you dumb? like do you know how laws work in our country?
[0:12:16] shadowstorm_sod: @magottx u blame the guy that get attacked?!?! Ur a great guy!!
[0:12:23] PocketLotion: violence ain’t the answer… until it is
[0:12:25] Phrosted_: @neonloon you have to slap the opponent in the face with a leather glove and challenge them to a duel first, then it is legal
[0:12:27] hunigsbase: where servers
[0:12:28] classygamer17: @copper_cloud not worth it since u get arrested over a crazy person
[0:12:29] j03seph: ppl talking a whole lot for not rlly knowing shit yet
[0:12:32] heygoditsme: idk, beating a drunk guy is not nice, but somehow mitch always manage to get into stuffs like this
[0:12:32] Erbsosa: mizkif a bitch hahaha
[0:12:32] Acework: @eygton i am happy i dont live there
[0:12:38] Magottx: @shadowstorm_sod context big guy. and his past with other "friends"
[0:12:41] paulieepaull2: mitch got in a 1v1? in RL after taking an illegal potion??? do I have the facts right ?
[0:12:45] heygoditsme: literal victim jones
[0:12:47] W0odie: There areUkrainian war films with millions of views
[0:12:50] PocketLotion: @paulieepaull2 KEKW
[0:12:51] neonloon: I really don't like miz so I hope this swings mitch way LUL
[0:12:54] copper_cloud: @classygamer17 only if that person pressed charges
[0:13:07] eyah: I didnt see the Mak'Gora flag in the mitch video was it a real duel?
[0:13:09] Xzanelol: @neonloon with his connections, never
[0:13:10] HunterericTV: he wasted all hes petri potion and didnt have 1 for when he needed it Kappa
[0:13:12] classygamer17: @copper_cloud yea not worth it just walk away
[0:13:14] yungcheesespread: @neonloon oh boy, drama versus miz and mitch or?
[0:13:15] PocketLotion: I don’t like miz either I wish Mitch wooped his ass
[0:13:16] Woah_Zerk: @paulieepaull2 His car accident wasn't a car accident, rather he took a beating from Mizkif. No full video context has been posted, just Mitch's accusations and before and after the assault as of now.
[0:13:23] MonkeyOverlord: two idiots with too much money do stupid things and the internet goes wild, next on your news at 6
[0:13:23] copper_cloud: If Mitch presses charges over a situation he could've avoided by not being hectic, that's kind of low t.
[0:13:27] inspect4: @HunterericTV LOL
[0:13:29] ddevillax: the steroids got to miz
[0:13:31] shadowstorm_sod: @magottx give the context that video is pretty damn but let's see how u cover for ur daddy miz
[0:13:38] tsetse2fly: xarCoC
[0:13:41] PocketLotion: steroids unfair advantage
[0:13:48] SuperSkunkFunk: watching just 3 mins of mitches video im 100% on miz side tbh
[0:13:49] PocketLotion: Mitch needs a reduel
[0:13:53] zestyerb: bro lmao the roid rage
[0:13:53] eygton: @acework maybe you should educate yourself before you make yourself look more dumb 😂
[0:13:56] eyah: I didnt see the Mak'Gora flag in the mitch video was it a real duel? 󠀀
[0:13:57] classygamer17: those steroids gave Miz anger issues what a surprise
[0:13:59] bmihai39: miz is a little bitch anyway
[0:14:05] Acework: even if Mitch sues and wins its still an extreme L for him
[0:14:10] heymatt: NA servers still down Sadge
[0:14:12] copper_cloud: Yeah knowing mitch, he most likely brought up things that he didn't have to
[0:14:13] 141jinji: i wonder what mitch said to miz to make him turn angry
[0:14:20] Ambroscious: are NA servers delayed another hour?
[0:14:24] gongoflex: game of jones lets go baby
[0:14:25] eygton: ace work bro I’d log of for the day 😂😂
[0:14:27] grave_mistak3: xar prob thought he was going to have a chill stream today lmao
[0:14:30] tsetse2fly: what are you guys talking about? Did miz wrestle Mitch?
[0:14:32] ApizBot: xarBite xarBite came here from mitch's video
[0:14:35] paulieepaull2: maybe he said car accident to spare drama.  he probs didn’t wanna blow up miz. or his lawyer said don’t tell about it.
[0:14:43] paulieepaull2: and since he streams he had to say something
[0:14:48] eygton: your actually dropping my IQ reading your messages 😂 @acework
[0:14:49] shadowstorm_sod: @apizbot same lmfao por xar
[0:14:51] Acework: @eygton whats your argument you just talk
[0:14:56] taylorsdank: oh boy
[0:15:01] julienb95: I'm in shock by this drama wtf
[0:15:02] stankylank: @tsetse2fly they got into a fight in 2023 appearantly, mitch just posted a vid about it on yt
[0:15:03] Dareka1111: miz 80%

[0:15:33] paulieepaull2: Mitch was emo 15 years ago. we expect and embrace the drama here 😆
[0:15:34] eygton: you saying seeing someone getting money from sueing and having the person you sued thrown in jail is a L
[0:15:34] ThoR294: BLIZZART
[0:15:38] taylorsdank: lets just try not to insult people guys :D
[0:15:39] Gyrospeter: there are also 2 videos that dropped a few minutes ago where the devs talk about sod p2... josh greenfield and rest
[0:15:41] HunterericTV: busy day ahead for the mods :D
[0:15:42] gongoflex: mitch gave me 50 dollars hes my boy
[0:15:43] zestyerb: that Audi tho
[0:15:49] zestyerb: 🔥
[0:15:51] eygton: that’s a iq drop
[0:15:51] Erbsosa: mizkif eatin curbs soon
[0:15:57] ThoR294: @zestyerb R8 is poor mans supercar
[0:15:57] ApizBot: i mean everyone rational should be on team mitch bcs the degree of violence was wild
[0:15:59] julienb95: I want to hear xaryus input on this
[0:16:00] neonloon: Tren makes everything a challenge/reason
[0:16:05] eyah: true mitch did buy me a xmas present and miz didnt im on team mitch
[0:16:05] stankylank: I say we arrange an IRL mak'gora for miz and mitch
[0:16:06] ApizBot: that said obv mitch's PR is sus
[0:16:08] 141jinji: pepeMeltdown
[0:16:11] kmilmuza: aint nobody going to jail. That was an agreed upon encounter looks like
[0:16:11] elpartido: @neonloon lmao
[0:16:15] zestyerb: @thor294 serious cap
[0:16:19] itouchbuttons: @ApizBot you made my brain hurt you dont even know the full story
[0:16:22] boveylol: guys uploading clips and not the full video is totally not suspicious or indicative of mitch doing something wrong
[0:16:30] ThoR294: @zestyerb its slow and gets destroyed by every other car in its category, google it
[0:16:33] ApizBot: do you know it? @itouchbuttons
[0:16:36] SuperSkunkFunk: so mitchy was drunk, on coke, talking shit and got his ass whooped? LUL
[0:16:40] copper_cloud: I tried to baby sit my cousin on cocaine once. he started beating me while I was driving.
[0:16:42] DefsTTV: FAFO'd
[0:16:42] copper_cloud: not a fun time.
[0:16:44] grave_mistak3: @boveylol he couldnt release the whole video. its against yt.
[0:16:46] YuraruY: @kmilmuza idk man the level of violence inflicted to him whilst he inflicted none to mizkif gonna be rough to defend
[0:16:46] julienb95: @superskunkfunk yup
[0:16:46] PocketLotion: drugs are bad mmkay
[0:16:47] itouchbuttons: @ApizBot no thats why i dont say anything lmao

[1:11:58] Jackzorrr: Because its a shit answer, you DONT have to make it a big gold sink
[1:11:59] Muckbot1: Because Xar, its a PAIN IN THE ASS to go back to town and respec, regardless of it only being 1g!!
[1:11:59] NailnScrew: people made cuz they want it now
[1:11:59] huckleson: this is literally preventing people from playing the game more
[1:12:00] Provence_Gaming: its just a simple QoL thing that can be added now, the gold sink is dumb
[1:12:00] Finikuz: imo, it's not that big of a deal
[1:12:00] ansgot: They want it sooner I guess
[1:12:00] Madmaxx777: just reduce epic mount price and replace the gold dump with dual spec. get cap and then spend 200g or something getting dual spec\
[1:12:00] wizbi_: we want it now, we are greedy
[1:12:00] BlueNeoh: Why can't we have more fun earlier? @Xaryu

[1:12:04] succaw: doesnt need to be a gold sink
[1:12:04] Vragmag: should be from level 10
[1:12:05] ClinxyWow: its not an L people are dumb
[1:12:05] VLLN: Make it a gold sink at 50 and not 60 when you need to save for epic mount
[1:12:05] KingQueenAce: HUGE W
[1:12:06] Bidsee: why
[1:12:06] da_Vindi: What's wrong with dual spec at 40?

[1:12:11] noTime29: and it being a gold sync is an awful decision :/
[1:12:11] huckleson: do you realize how often people dont play the game more becaues they dont want to respec?
[1:12:11] tblizzzy: why
[1:12:11] SimplerDaze: because chatters lack brainpower
[1:12:12] Sokr0h: now but dont make it 1000g

[1:12:15] Resonance_Cero: Respecs costing money is the dumbest thing
[1:12:15] SpecialAgent_FeelsDankMan: NOW Madge
[1:12:16] ThoR294: you play 1 spec class thats why
[1:12:16] teraldsoups: just make the gold cost less?? what’s the point of not having it?
[1:12:16] asloff: why not now?
[1:12:16] TMMOOF: we want pvp/pve specs
[1:12:16] Zelman444: doing it now would be perfect
[1:12:17] rocknsake: @Diddly_dope naa screw that, it needs to be a core feature
[1:12:17] espi: It's annoying AF to respec every raid / WSG
[1:12:17] shothos: its an L to wait
[1:12:17] PleaseSayWee: i switch about 1 time ea day
[1:12:19] inspect4: 40 would be great for dual spec since u can go deep alrdy at 40
[1:12:19] Theine16: then respect from pvp spec to tank spec
[1:12:19] Denat0: doing it now people would literally just buy gold to get it fuck that
[1:12:20] koltgaming45: THey already lowered the gold cost these crybabies say no change on something that isnt classic
[1:12:20] swyftboi: Sorry, what actually is dual spec? I know you can have talent points in multiple trees…

[1:12:21] huckleson: na its a huge L
[1:12:21] ariacy: People want it now and for free lol
[1:12:22] BlueNeoh: Explain why it's a W
[1:12:22] Speyto: now! one spec for pvp and one for pve
[1:12:24] NailnScrew: dual spec should come lvl 50
[1:12:24] TrueNosus: adding it later is deff the way to go
[1:12:26] frederikv225: it is
[1:12:27] Theine16: then respec from tank spec to pvp spec
[1:12:27] sharkybng: @xaryu Tell us why you think 40 is bad vs 50
[1:12:29] LilTaisu: Can you give a good reason why waiting for it is good?
[1:12:30] P_h_l_o_x: I want it for free and to buy a boost to 40
[1:12:31] BigBabaOne77: why is it bad now
[1:12:33] christiangodwarrior97: why is it better to add it later?
[1:12:37] teraldsoups: had to respec a lot from balance to resto to get into raid groups quicker
[1:12:38] tblizzzy: dual spec should of came at 25
[1:12:41] Mahca_: people complain about everything
[1:12:45] Haracept: They ruined my small GDKP group f this game and guilds Kappa

[1:12:48] tblizzzy: it doesnt hurt anything
[1:12:49] lordhodza: It would be nice to be able to switch back and forth for when we are traveling to instances
[1:12:55] PleaseSayWee: i need to swap between pve and pvp spec ll the time
[1:12:56] Iamcapped: There is nothing good about not having dual spec heading into a phase where pvp will be important for grinding weps and pve will still also be played
[1:12:59] ama__deus: @teraldsoups they can't even tell whether you're resto LUL just heal in balance, content is so easy anyway
[1:13:01] Nlbbler: its akward to give alle the classes new speccs (like rogue or shaman tank) and dont implement dual specc right away ...
[1:13:06] LilTaisu: It's not complaining lmao it's a season of discovery where things are changing just give us dual spec

[1:13:33] NawtyTyme: lol
[1:13:34] NailnScrew: W
[1:13:37] Diddly_dope: pika wont clear till phase 3
[1:13:39] huckleson: how is this so difficult to understand, having to respec actively stops people from playing the game more

[1:22:11] YzieGG: POGGERS
[1:22:13] leslarocque: @shadowstorm_sod you can have mine I’m cute
[1:22:14] Joshorhea: Servers Back up lets goo (SoD)
[1:22:17] Lightshadow86: I just wish there were some near unbeatable mobs that were hard from the start of the phase, then eventually when you get gear they are within range
[1:22:21] Jubilation12: @ama__deus its in the roadmap
[1:22:40] shadowstorm_sod: @leslarocque I look like a orc irl 😘
[1:22:41] ama__deus: @Jubilation12 yeah that's what I am saying. Just turn it into its own thing. No need to inject our characters into era servers
[1:22:48] Provence_Gaming: new lvl 50 raid would be dope
[1:22:58] Jubilation12: @ama__deus yea fingers crossed haha
[1:23:02] The_RightTwix: Im disappointed in no dual spec in p2
[1:23:03] inspect4: who are these guys btw

[1:23:21] TMMOOF: nameplates would be huge W
[1:23:21] YzieGG: and epics for login ofc KEKW
[1:23:22] fetza108: big question
[1:23:27] shadowstorm_sod: @the_righttwix right it's been expensive having to change spec so much
[1:23:35] leslarocque: @turdburgison yeah no plans for p2
[1:23:36] grayscael: @inspect4 wondering the same thing
[1:23:38] Joshorhea: yoo 50% xp buff is live already

[1:23:46] TurdBurgison: rip
[1:23:46] fleesyo: whack
[1:23:54] grizzlyhead: Imagine they added dungeon finder KEKW
[1:23:57] ThoR294: @Xaryu chronoboon isnt at reagent vendor anymore KEKW
[1:23:58] big_lebowski_69: caves..
[1:24:02] Phav: you just adjust name sizes though right
[1:24:06] Jubilation12: @thor294 what why?
[1:24:09] bocianiklekot: Jebaited
[1:24:09] fleesyo: 20 yard nameplates as a ranged for tab targeting is so bad
[1:24:09] totezmcgoatz_: bad justification for this
[1:24:10] ado027: @shadowstorm_sod its not expensive but its boring, i dont want to go to town every time i want to pvp
[1:24:11] ThoR294: @Jubilation12 i didnt see it in darn
[1:24:14] LilTaisu: Lmao beeing able to see is too op
[1:24:16] Pygsystim: 20 yd nameplates are just plain bad
[1:24:17] Bloozin: whats a /target macro do
[1:24:20] leslarocque: I’m gonna go hard got 2 weeks off work on release day
[1:24:21] californiacal: thats a lazy answer imo
[1:24:23] Jubilation12: @phav nah theyre talking about range not size
[1:24:24] imvecks: @fleesyo that's exactly his point, if its further its OP
[1:24:25] sancXD: share vid link?
[1:24:25] ssoftspots: no its not
[1:24:25] cekz__: true
[1:24:26] LilTaisu: Just an excuse for not doing imo
[1:24:29] VerdenTheBleak: bad logic
[1:24:30] Varels1: W awareness
[1:24:31] Pweep: holy fuck its a 20 year old game it's been powergamed into the ground, what a dogshit excuse
[1:24:32] ssoftspots: 20 yards it perfect
[1:24:35] Poolhaus: So... you're saying theres a chance?
[1:24:40] fleesyo: @imvecks he just proved my point
[1:24:41] NelsonGamingShow: nameplate distance is trash
[1:24:41] ssoftspots: dont make the game easy
[1:24:46] Phav: Jubilation12 yeah but you can still see stuff 20+yd away if you adjust name size to make it  easier is what i mean
[1:24:54] LilTaisu: 20 yards is not perfect
[1:24:55] ssoftspots: retail sucks cause its so easy
[1:24:56] stayliftedna: I am witnessing the Red Sea parting
[1:24:57] IiveviI: a focus target would be nice
[1:24:59] ama__deus: Yeah, nameplates wasn't one of them LUL
[1:24:59] big_lebowski_69: 30 yards okay
[1:24:59] Doimos89: some classic shit is just anoying though
[1:25:00] imvecks: @fleesyo No its the other way around, 40yard plates is not classic
[1:25:00] TMMOOF: but druids can cast 42 yards lol
[1:25:02] shadowstorm_sod: @ado027 yea but if the reason they don't want to do it for cost in game but I would bet I spend more in the meantime they dual will cost
[1:25:03] shaggy462: 30 yards is a good middle ground
[1:25:03] LilTaisu: Most abilities go much further than 25
[1:25:04] VerdenTheBleak: 30y would be perfect tbh
[1:25:05] Roccox2xx: I like the@limited nameplates. you can actually set up ambushes in the world.
[1:25:11] ama__deus: @TMMOOF only for 3 more days KEKW
[1:25:12] Ryzir: Enchanting Vellum is good. Enchanters having to stand in the city for hours to make money is lame when other professions don't have to.
[1:25:14] PenysDeTable: Doimos89 annoying is what's great
[1:25:17] fleesyo: @imvecks if my ability can go 30+ yards, i should be able to see that nameplate, jussayin
[1:25:19] ssoftspots: you want 40yards play retail
[1:25:20] VerdenTheBleak: 20y isn't even max range for hunter or casters
[1:25:24] boomy5g: I will win this
[1:25:25] Vragmag: no nameplates would be perfect
[1:25:26] imvecks: @fleesyo Why? xD
[1:25:26] espi: I just want nameplate for my target if it's within range
[1:25:27] frenchcataphract: honestly good point
[1:25:28] scorpinot: BFD Trinkets selling for 75G from vendor now, GEEGEE
[1:25:28] Gokublue001: still need changes. waiting long time is the reason wow and sc2 couldn't keep up with league changing almost every week
[1:25:28] Munklebear: nameplates such an easy fix, just do it already
[1:25:33] imvecks: @fleesyo Why SHOULD you
[1:25:40] YzieGG: YEP
[1:25:40] Zashooo: YES

[1:25:49] ssoftspots: and look where retail is
[1:25:50] LaneWillingham: yeah josh seems like a real dude
[1:25:51] grimnor375: not having a nameplate in view when i'm in range to use abilities is cancer
[1:25:51] NelsonGamingShow: why can you cast but not have nameplate lmao its stupid
[1:25:52] Roccox2xx: he’s a serious chad.
[1:25:52] AbyssReborn: he is a good coder
[1:25:53] ClinxyWow: agrend is dope. and he truly loves the game
[1:25:53] Snakeyboylol: @Xaryu Josh is a big josh fan, whoda funk it
[1:25:54] g_rowdee: josh is our savior
[1:25:56] bbhank1: thinks more then one step ahead
[1:25:56] ssoftspots: garbage

[1:26:06] Zoismoe: uhhh did you see the mitch/mizkif shit? @Xaryu
[1:26:06] clee0724: Josh W
[1:26:08] imvecks: @fleesyo Because as he said, having 40 yard plates makes things Wayyy easier, it would be OP for many reasons
[1:26:08] kimbo_2: Josh for Blizz CEO
[1:26:08] LilTaisu: Yeah but still but 40y name plates won't screw the game over
[1:26:09] bbhank1: and he said they might do it anyway, at least he is aware
[1:26:09] bigwilly3737: @terrorhungry23 yep
[1:26:11] xxbluexdragonxx: W

[1:26:38] Gokublue001: they can do it when they are losing money. heard that too many times lol
[1:26:41] fleesyo: @imvecks i think easy is the wrong word, it makes combat more fluid and intuitive, i can see it being shorter in pvp combat, but not in pve
[1:26:41] ClinxyWow: thats the same question. i hate this guy
[1:26:42] adam_brisbane: Starsurge changed Pog

[1:37:45] LaneWillingham: its the whole package, its a grind, people interacting, economy is fun, and just more feelings of accomplishment in general
[1:37:46] Cryptozow: which is fine

[1:37:46] big_lebowski_69: smaller world

[1:38:03] Guydx: @ipntheshower Not on europe it seems, I'm on my 13 mage
[1:38:10] shaggy462: @rollinsthechamp I'm not sure what you mean, devs have already said arena doesnt have a place in classic wow
[1:38:11] miercoles_: @aswaran2132 i didnt mean it as a bad thing, but it is certainly disregard
[1:38:14] killthnrun: for sure

[1:39:12] bbhank1: i want a pvp zone like in runescape would be sick
[1:39:13] shaggy462: @rollinsthechamp Yeah some might want it, but its never happening

[1:39:57] ImEffidja: Let's be honest here are they trying to make wow good again? Or is it going to be shacked by purist?

[1:40:26] greatsadge: @inspect4 that guy is truly insufferable
[1:40:27] Bebe_Rexxar: that smile
[1:40:27] shaggy462: @rollinsthechamp Yeah but theyre hardline on no arenas in SoD, do you undertstand how much more balancing work the devs would have to do? its not worth their time

[1:42:21] thatdogbitme: Good question
[1:42:26] gbish00: Come back kids
[1:42:27] araltus791: 10 man raids are kind of anti guild to be honest..
[1:42:36] MonzonWasTaken: guy on the right is a bobblehead KEKW
[1:42:39] fleesyo: @araltus791 they really are
[1:42:40] fr03doc: @clintdotgg second that question
[1:42:40] illists: keep dkps out :D
[1:42:47] Gunnan22: Raid every 3 days are anti guild also

[1:43:34] bepsisthebeast: its cheating
[1:43:35] ReconMazihoFanda: GDKP has always been negative
[1:43:36] SoWereInCopperThen: @Xaryu when you recieve a "cut" from a gdkp its tough to ban
[1:43:38] Judeese: A lot of changes went live on sod goddamn
[1:43:39] 000000000Machea96: im lucky to be in a guild that takes the time to host 3-4 raids of 10 mans 2x a week
[1:43:42] ThoR294: YEP
[1:43:43] shaggy462: @araltus791 i suspect they might add a 20 raid at 60, but i doubt in the leveling phases
[1:43:43] ThoR294: laundering
[1:43:52] greatsadge: yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
[1:44:05] athalon: Benefitting from the gold buying
[1:44:13] grizzlyhead: exactly
[1:44:17] bigblinky69: bitcoin washing
[1:44:18] sweatlordkush: banning GDKPs is BASED
[1:44:20] darkwingduck06: So keep botting don't do gdkp...
[1:44:20] ReconMazihoFanda: its been like that forever look at every guild ever
[1:44:23] g_rowdee: Laundering LUL
[1:44:29] miercoles_: its kind of like banning laundromats though, no?
[1:44:32] blazzedzz: Yeah it's all dirty money
[1:44:32] Medinore: My account got banned for this exact reason, I ended up with RMT gold and got the ban stick
[1:44:36] 000000000Machea96: Super based, took em 20 years tho
[1:44:40] Gokublue001: for second i thought they are listening to xar lol
[1:44:47] thatdogbitme: Wrecking the gold seller's broader economy
[1:44:49] shaygauge24: you're naive if you think each individual gold piece can be tracked
[1:44:50] luzid7: yeah AND people that don't do gdkp don't get any from the gold so they are still poor and everything is fckn expensive over time ...
[1:44:52] oprawindfurytv: IM A BROKE BOY
[1:44:57] oprawindfurytv: so no ban
[1:45:00] inhaledthc: Gdkp are for idiots :D
[1:45:05] shreddingog: can they? people buying that gold still use that gold to buy consumables and exp boosting?
[1:45:10] DiscoDamage: it needs tracking of the EVERY gold transaction of EVERY player xar
[1:45:14] gorthymog: sound like some Ozark stuff
[1:45:17] espi: @shaygauge24 ? gold pieces aren't being tracked, transactions are.
[1:45:18] Z3ND0G: they can still buy AH
[1:45:18] fsutoxiic0: You just invite the Gold Seller into your guild, They drop off the gold in the Guild bank and they leave. Blizzard DOES NOT keep track of gold in and out of Guild banks
[1:45:20] luzid7: thats what asmon and a lot of other people don't understand
[1:45:20] RollinSpinnas: Gold is pretty easy to make in SoD and it seems like they are adding ways to make gold. Weird that people would need to buy G atm
[1:45:29] darkwingduck06: supply crate turn inn is bugged right now
[1:45:33] oprawindfurytv: @inhaledthc how else do i get raid gear for pvp?
[1:45:34] shaygauge24: 0% chance they do this, they literally just fired assloads of people
[1:45:36] booker105: @fsutoxiic0 no gbanks in classic sccooby doo
[1:45:47] Kyseeth: GDKP is like casino with money laundering
[1:45:48] freddan92: bann gdkps tbh
[1:45:50] fsutoxiic0: @booker105 I am saying if they bring Gbank in lvl 60
[1:45:59] shaygauge24: @Loopylynxx lmao with all of their layoffs? Be honest with yourself
[1:45:59] freddan92: Gdkps is a gold buying mecha
[1:46:02] joshywoshhyy: yeah guild bank is still the easiest method if you’re scumming gold
[1:46:08] biigredant: i report everyone trying to GDKP
[1:46:09] espi: peacebloom dkp
[1:46:09] p_Tatoes: @Xaryu it seems like theyre still not going after bots but just going after gold buyers and sellers. Seems like a cop out almost
[1:46:10] oprawindfurytv: PEACEBLOOM DKP
[1:46:12] Gunnan22: People will find a way they always do to get around these things
[1:46:12] YzieGG: the know NOWAY
[1:46:13] SoWereInCopperThen: @Xaryu as someone who use to do gkdps alot in classic wrath,  people 100 percent hide behind gdkps to hide their gold i know of people who would buy 200k gold from the  raid runner and theyd trade it as a bonus cut
[1:46:14] tsetse2fly: Xardkp
[1:46:22] espi: Xardkp monkaS
[1:46:22] Cryptozow: anyway, AI will surpass any systems they implement in the short term so
[1:46:24] Nimyrak: WE NEED A NEW MMO, CANT WAIT FOR RIOT/LEAGUE MMO.
[1:46:26] Mico027: Nobody is gonna bother with that kind of logistic LUL
[1:46:28] rocknsake: so he's admitting there are still ways to get past them
[1:46:29] Daxter96: gdkps are ok, people just need to dont care about what other ppl do. I dont buy gold and like gdkps

[1:47:44] californiacal: if youre getting banned for a gdkp you deserve it you know what youre getting into
[1:47:44] TMMOOF: just roll for loot and you'll be fine
[1:47:53] snaxx23: Ignorance is no excuse
[1:47:53] leslarocque: i got traded 20 gold and got banned for a week because the person bought the gold

[1:48:47] TrueNosus: KEKW
[1:48:47] darth_honeybadger: GDKP's themselves don't ruin the economy, unfortunately they do MASSIVELY augment the rmt gold buying problem.  Let the neckbeards have this victory and hope it deters gold buying.
[1:48:48] krebz: dude
[1:48:49] mylittlehombre: if blizz banned a few gold buyers that would be huge

[2:04:41] moarpwp: pvp battles ??????????
[2:04:41] serverfirst300003: guys, its so simple, they are using their work accounts where they were made to mention their pronouns for video conferences, hence why Jacobs doesnt have it. Knowing from expereince
[2:04:42] bughinel1988: They said anything about dual spec???

[2:05:27] superbaal: so if ashenvale "changed from 1 hour to 3 hours" was it always on a hidden timer regardless of the percentage?

[2:08:27] shaggy462: @brandogzz twitch chat really isnt the place to debate this, wether you agree or disagree

[2:09:44] Daemon_Ducky: Well won't ever play Wow since I touched Gw2, maybe if they go WoW II upgrade that old shit.
[2:09:49] VerdenTheBleak: Personally the best PvP in classic is organic PvP. All of the forced PvP or PvP with an end goal with an incentive will always be min/maxed where it focuses less on PvP and more on maximizing rewards.
[2:09:51] metrospider9: damn i really appreciate those pronouns clay totally wouldve assumed u were female

[2:12:54] everganaj: Ok they need to make it so it layers people. I can already see this happening. People opting out in pvp realms creating a giant raid group just killing people on the other faction who cant make big groups

[2:14:50] Bloozin: nah agreed
[2:14:50] carrbon_2k: youll have a huge thunder srike hit you when you use it you cant miss it
[2:14:50] gorthymog: only 1 world buff should be it
[2:14:50] Bidsee: id rather not
[2:14:51] Showmaker237: can get two world buffs and use a hymn from pvp

[2:14:53] Bioaim7: no it sucks
[2:14:54] VerdenTheBleak: I shouldn't have to PvP to get a wb
[2:14:55] creedknows: the less i have to run around and grab shit to raid the better
[2:14:55] Lewbra: the approach they took is the best
[2:14:55] Rattoney: some wbuffs is nice but it can go too far
[2:14:55] Saturos47: its terrible
[2:14:56] Dumboodaking: no
[2:14:57] Knocktoff: i did it every week but like the fact its not returning
[2:14:57] ClinxyWow: i wish worldbuffs werent part of the game
[2:14:58] fastest2synapses: pointless chase
[2:14:58] MatDiGi: No, maybe if it was more fun
[2:14:58] TodBobertson: MORE WORLD BUFFS! MORE POWAH!
[2:14:58] Mammamia007: BFD buff was enough for me
[2:14:59] Cenarios13: cant boon it too
[2:14:59] zZmBz: def no thte minority
[2:14:59] sharky_exp: @Xaryu i dont like collecting buffs ------
[2:15:00] finalflight1: Meh depends on how far I have to travel
[2:15:01] calm_palm_tree: I did it once
[2:15:01] chr47: it sucks because it wasn't boonable @Xaryu
[2:15:01] studshift: i like boon not drums
[2:15:03] Selfishdude92: its a rep grind
[2:15:06] Zalien13: if it would be MS then yea no DMG
[2:15:07] gassylammas: its tedious
[2:15:09] YzieGG: makes the raid mor ez
[2:15:10] Thorforn: Weekly and 1000 rep for the last few weeks.
[2:15:11] iRambo96: it’s annoying
[2:15:11] mungas1: I enjoy doing more damage
[2:15:12] jaylen4pres: only thing that's annoying is it doesn't boon, it's fine otherwise
[2:15:13] ikuze: The buff is pointless waste of time
[2:15:13] Gokublue001: 25 wasn't bad but 60 takes hours and annoying
[2:15:13] JihnFei: boon is fine drums was dogshit
[2:15:14] zZmBz: who the fuck wants to wander aroiund the world for 2 hours picking up buffs for a super easy game
[2:15:14] Dreamlights: You do it for the rep not for the buff . The buff is just a bonus
[2:15:22] MaibaumderHaibaum: fuck worldbuffs!
[2:15:24] Knaxxis: how long did u play for sod for 3 weeks ?
[2:15:25] testiklees3: AGRREED
[2:15:25] Huxm: ]
[2:15:25] Gashunk1: It's boring to roll an alt and you gotta farm the BiS runes. that sucks
[2:15:27] Tropicocity: Yo...just saw, the 50% XP 1-25 buff is live on NA right now
[2:15:28] p_Tatoes: it adds a level of snobby-ness
[2:15:30] willsmiled: 100 world buffs at 60 will ruin sod i think
[2:15:30] carrbon_2k: agrrred
[2:15:34] carrbon_2k: agreeded
[2:15:36] LaneWillingham: if you think about it, in real life youre much stronger when youve had a good meal and proper rest though lol
[2:15:37] volkr16: yea its annoying 10000% agree
[2:15:40] ChiefRaae: agree
[2:15:42] Heazzly: you do the quest more for the rep, not the buff..
[2:15:43] fastest2synapses: random consumption being required to feel powerful is a dumb concept and has been for a long time
[2:15:43] davesodave: agreed
[2:15:44] Krekdent: yeah its annoying
[2:15:48] Kroski: @Gashunk1 What do you want lol? everything given to you>
[2:15:52] Gashunk1: hahahah
[2:15:53] ama__deus: Have to min/max your food intake in RL as well to unlock your max power GIGACHAD
[2:15:53] copper_cloud: mage food..?
[2:15:55] ScryerTV: I dont agree
[2:15:55] Bloozin: food and elixirs and good imo. keeps professions relevant
[2:15:56] AMNZ7: return to arena bro
[2:15:59] Chazmaglazz: it's unneeded
[2:16:00] Pogsible: RETAIL ANDY
[2:16:02] christ0of: but its more realistic to real life man - you gotta eat right to min max if u eat mcdonnys u aint nothing
[2:16:02] Ink0gnit0_1200: they should make gear harder to get and buffs less effective
[2:16:02] slapshotsd: nah hard agree collecting world buffs all over the place is tedious and unfun
[2:16:04] zeqxylol: as an arena player only i think the same
[2:16:04] Gashunk1: <3
[2:16:06] MongoSecurity: Just go plain and natural into a fight tbh
[2:16:07] darth_honeybadger: World buff meta is gross.
[2:16:08] testiklees3: no you right, its insane to collect all that crap just to go raid or so
[2:16:09] ChiefRaae: make a poll i think most peopla agree @Xaryu
[2:16:10] DizBombMcgee: I think the food in survival games is fine, adds another layer of difficulty
[2:16:13] volkr16: full natty power is bis
[2:16:14] ralphh1541: bros name is Clay Stone
[2:16:14] creedknows: i mean i think getting buffs from the professions is part of the game tho, but the other buffs to grab all over is kinda silly.
[2:16:23] YzieGG: content is to hard for players without like in SOM
[2:16:26] tengahurts: its just annoying and not fun to track a million things just to stay competetive. absolutly hate that
[2:16:36] Varels1: lmao metrospider what? get real
[2:16:40] berserage95: this isnt meant to be toxic but are pronouns are thing in america? like its a requirement
[2:16:44] Link2269: how much time it take to get to lvl 25 in sod
[2:16:54] Ink0gnit0_1200: gear should be harder to obtain and buffs should be erased from the game
[2:16:54] ama__deus: FeelsDankMan chat
[2:16:54] Knocktoff: <3 out to the mods working overtime rn
[2:16:55] slapshotsd: the problem is they're upgrades you have to get for yourself over and over again so it feels like an unnecessary time sink, unlike an item you could store in your bag that could regularly buff you or something like runes in retail
[2:16:56] LaneWillingham: stay away from the pp i love this woman
[2:16:57] oompous: chat getting weird
[2:17:00] CygnusC: calm down chat
[2:17:04] MongoSecurity: LUL
[2:17:06] theaccountant219: damn chat is wildin out today
[2:17:13] jaylen4pres: @tengahurts but you're not forced to be competitive. the raid is puggable and doable without buffs and without most consumes so it just gives people the option of going hard if they want to
[2:17:17] 2oublewidesuprise: tf is chat saying LUL
[2:17:17] handovdoom666: you can't sit in town and collect rep now
[2:17:19] tingsdp: FOCUS ON THE GAME INTERVIEW
[2:17:21] HelluvaWrecks: @weeatrockss outside of america, theyre called normal people
[2:17:24] Mammamia007: cant wait for the 2h shammy weapon
[2:17:27] tingsdp: FOCUS ON GAME PHASE 2 SOD
[2:17:27] BluntstepTV: @weeatrockss it's a commie thing
[2:17:27] slapshotsd: @weeatrockss yes it is a required thing in most huge corporations on your work accounts, it has literally nothing to do with political affiliation
[2:17:28] alecsu88: Scott is an it?
[2:17:31] MongoSecurity: Chat goin HAM
[2:17:36] rollinsthechamp: Scott surely not participating
[2:17:39] berserage95: @weeatrockss LUL bruh
[2:17:46] RJdude: anyone know if sod will have arena any time?
[2:17:49] alexgoat94: holy
[2:17:52] YzieGG: POGGERS
[2:17:53] tengahurts: @jaylen4pres ye i ment in general
[2:17:55] LaneWillingham: wow thats a ton i feel like

[2:18:01] Jubilation12: YEP
[2:18:01] marius402: I think they nerfed living flame heal
[2:18:01] jmt1616: some of the leaked ones were p3
[2:18:01] 420friendlygrandma: 10
[2:18:02] wankels: It shows in live now
[2:18:03] xSaruTV: Jebaited
[2:18:03] Nohez: only belt and boots in p2
[2:18:03] iscamog: helm and wrist aren't in
[2:18:03] Krekdent: yea
[2:18:05] jaylen4pres: @tengahurts fair
[2:18:06] lukemeleney: fake outs
[2:18:08] ansgot: Deep freeze will be one of them COPIUM
[2:18:09] chr47: probably the head + bracer runes aren't p2
[2:18:09] darth_honeybadger: 3-4 per new slot
[2:18:11] Tropicocity: @Xaryu its going to be 3 belt 3 boots, the 7 is likely because shaman get 2h rune for chest etc
[2:18:11] JihnFei: losers getting offended by pronouns. How soft and fragile are you KEKW
[2:18:13] geennaamnl1: Can someone borrow me an extra hand , cause so many spells to push
[2:18:15] melvinguyy: warriors getting 10 min bs?
[2:18:23] swaggybmoney: Do PVE realms operate the same way.  if so then why go on a PVP realm when they are having these events each season to allow players to get there PVP in?
[2:18:24] Dellagardie: good questions, yea?
[2:18:25] oompous: what is up with chat lmao
[2:18:30] JihnFei: go back to staysafes chat if you are offended by people people up pronouns next to their names
[2:18:30] Knaxxis: @JihnFei ur a weirdo
[2:18:31] ClinxyWow: these questions are so much better than the last video
[2:18:31] Gethrian: @brandogzz pronouns don’t exist in other regions?
[2:18:33] NailnScrew: you say the helm and bracer runes that are in testing
[2:18:35] CatformTV: cause its entrance is in booty bay
[2:18:39] ClinxyWow: the last guy asked about a pet tab
[2:18:42] jmt1616: yea SM was the obious choice
[2:18:48] 420friendlygrandma: engraver addon shows new runes
[2:18:48] jaylen4pres: @oompous nobody is jingling keys so it's getting fussy
[2:18:51] ama__deus: @Knaxxis he's right you know KEKW
[2:18:51] Chazmaglazz: wait how are horde gonna raid gnomer
[2:18:51] YzieGG: sadly
[2:18:53] Vertov64: Giga Brain
[2:18:56] berserage95: @JihnFei its more nuanced than u think lol
[2:18:56] Bewts: Compelled speech is cool and here's why: Chatting
[2:18:57] oompous: @oompous lmao fair
[2:18:59] sound_wayv: BRD
[2:19:00] darth_honeybadger: No one loved Gnomer
[2:19:01] ruperttheyeti: true, i HATE gnomer
[2:19:01] chr47: they removed the shittiest dungeons f100%
[2:19:01] Tropicocity: nobody loved gnomeregan tbh YEP
[2:19:01] MongoSecurity: What would be cool is if you could change the element like instead of deep freeze is Deep Fried and fire would be crazy
[2:19:01] Angsterz: 5Head
[2:19:01] ClinxyWow: BRD
[2:19:03] Xzanelol: @Chazmaglazz theres a teleporter, always been
[2:19:03] espi: MAR
[2:19:04] Deomas11: Good point Xar
[2:19:04] shaggy462: @Chazmaglazz, they get a portal
[2:19:04] JihnFei: @Knaxxis why are you offended  with people people prounouns nexst to their name? are you soft and fragile like staysafe?
[2:19:05] Syzlak3: no one like WC
[2:19:05] espi: MARA
[2:19:05] creedknows: gnomer was a nightmare XD
[2:19:07] slapshotsd: mods doing the lord's work bless
[2:19:11] crazyboy1_: who the f likes WC?
[2:19:12] Knaxxis: @ama__deus  who gives a fuck
[2:19:13] lloydimus: NO one likes gnomer
[2:19:14] espi: @Syzlak3 I love WC
[2:19:19] Varels1: we're going to be forced to love gnomer lol
[2:19:19] whozmanzisths: true
[2:19:20] Chazmaglazz: ah yeah i forgot about the teleporter
[2:19:20] gnated: nope
[2:19:20] dramajohns: its not actually out of the way. the tp is in Strangelthorn which is the pvp zone
[2:19:21] polesreport: no
[2:19:21] jbarish: @jihnfei stay safe is the fkn man Based/gamer
[2:19:22] MongoSecurity: Gnomer sucked tbh
[2:19:23] Vertov64: BFD was my favorite lol
[2:19:23] professor_of_math_harvard: yes
[2:19:23] gnated: hates it
[2:19:23] wreck561: i hated it
[2:19:23] testiklees3: haha true
[2:19:24] grizzlyhead: nah BRD as a raid will be epic
[2:19:24] goochyboi: it was fun for a week
[2:19:25] TodBobertson: BFD #1
[2:19:26] jaylen4pres: @berserage95 can you explain some of the nuance?
[2:19:26] Oparlive: I love SFK
[2:19:26] BingoBangoLive: Almost never did BFD or gnomer
[2:19:27] geennaamnl1: I loved gnomeregan but just once
[2:19:27] jumpalottahigh: never liked bfd before
[2:19:27] creedknows: gnomer was the worst to die in by far
[2:19:28] dildyj: people didnt like bfd because of the location
[2:19:28] Dumboodaking: @crazyboy1_ a lot of people love it because its their first dungeon
[2:19:29] frederikv225: nah hated it
[2:19:30] wihahz: so temple? PauseChamp
[2:19:30] Frostlicious: Why make all the raids the ones people dislike KEK
[2:19:30] macjcool: WC is a lot of fun at low lvl
[2:19:30] ama__deus: BFD was safe to modify
[2:19:33] Tropicocity: BFD was only good to see it in Uberdanger's video YEP
[2:19:33] StoneyYeti: way better than vc and sfk
[2:19:34] Krekdent: nah, but as a raid.. its fun for me
[2:19:35] berserage95: @berserage95 no i enjoy having chat
[2:19:36] sighwarlock: I didnt do BFD all 3 of my 60s leveling up
[2:19:36] lloydimus: true
[2:19:36] NautilusBTW: @xzanelol will you participate in the CDL level 40?
[2:19:37] slapshotsd: @Dumboodaking yup that's me
[2:19:38] jalgorithm: @JihnFei no its not nuanced at all bro lmao
[2:19:38] Weemancod: they just have to add the raid and normal options. They already have it in the game right? Normal/heroic toggle. Solved
[2:19:40] Zashooo: true
[2:19:40] Quantitty: I hated gnomer
[2:19:40] fetza108: nooooooooo
[2:19:40] xCEvans: theyre also long dungeons
[2:19:41] walkingded23: gnomer sucked lol
[2:19:41] Amerish88: Can you imagine the ppl planning on dungeon spamming if SM was removed lol
[2:19:41] espi: Gnomer is fun D:
[2:19:42] TrueNosus: tbh i dont know if i ever ran classic version of bfd
[2:19:42] tsetse2fly: It's faction neutral/ish
[2:19:42] klacklack: Gnomeregan also shit
[2:19:42] chobinhood_: its my favorite :(
[2:19:43] macjcool: so probably ZF instead of SM?
[2:19:43] ama__deus: Gnomer is also big enough for 10m
[2:19:43] sighwarlock: or gnomers
[2:19:45] Cant0n: People love dying in that one pull in Gnomer tho KEKW
[2:19:45] k3rtyy: Gnomeregan is shit
[2:19:45] YzieGG: cause they wipe all time KEKW
[2:19:45] MongoSecurity: SCARLETT
[2:19:45] Zalien13: who loikes gnomergan ?
[2:19:45] grizzlyhead: It's the most hated dungeon
[2:19:45] oompous: ST was my favorite
[2:19:45] CubicleGangster: I loved that shit, the punchcards and all
[2:19:45] creedknows: i loved gnomer but if you died it was assssss
[2:19:47] igorTwiF: Worst dungeon is Gnomeregan xD
[2:19:47] d_droplet: is saying ''there is 2 genders'' offensive? i'm actually curious.
[2:19:47] Jsibs: no 1 liked gnomer
[2:19:48] Dellagardie: my favourite
[2:19:48] MongoSecurity: SM
[2:19:48] inspect4: gnomer is kinda sick without the music
[2:19:48] Bonus_HiTops: I'm callin it - SUNKEN TEMPLE next phase as the raid
[2:19:49] Bewts: ST for 50
[2:19:49] rekeke: I like Gnomer but not my favorite so I'm super excited for it to be a raid!
[2:19:49] gnated: gnomer was annoying
[2:19:50] d0mezg4mer: there's dozens of us! dozens!
[2:19:50] MatDiGi: wasn’t a favorite but it was fun
[2:19:50] Synoxin: thats why i think the 50 raid will be sunken temple
[2:19:51] krazkolul: you just changed my whole perspective on this
[2:19:52] lolzandis: i agree, already predicting sunken temple will be a level 50 raid
[2:19:53] aeverite: I like the fact that they took the "longer" dungeons and shortened them up
[2:19:54] sighwarlock: gnomers is a shit tier dungeon to pug.
[2:19:55] ama__deus: @macjcool Sunken Temple, I'd think
[2:19:56] Goated_Goods: It lines up perfectly with them stating they wanted players to Discover content that was mostly neglected in the past.
[2:19:57] sodarf: znd it will not be my favorite raid either i think XD
[2:19:57] polesreport: one of rfd or rfk couldve worked too
[2:19:58] darth_honeybadger: Gnomer was almost as gross as gnomes themselves.
[2:20:00] CygnusC: next phase should be sunken temple
[2:20:02] NailnScrew: BFD for horde was a hard pass lol
[2:20:03] MongoSecurity: +10000 for SM
[2:20:04] The_RightTwix: Gnomeregon was just annoying because it was harder to navigate and you randomly die
[2:20:04] dramajohns: gnomergan is a nightmare. u always do it once for teh quests thats it
[2:20:06] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[2:20:06] macjcool: @ama__deus ooh thats a good guess
[2:20:06] Zownos: agreed
[2:20:06] Deomas11: So then next will be Uldaman, not ZF or ST
[2:20:07] CubicleGangster: They want us to rediscover them...it's the whole theme
[2:20:07] berserage95: i think they should make new content instead of rehasing everything LUL
[2:20:07] FalanthosDB: FOR GNOMEREGAN :Nerd:
[2:20:07] Kersed805: so LBRS will be a raid
[2:20:09] lloydimus: lvl 50 raid will be ST watch lol
[2:20:10] warpot0305: so you're saying lvl 50 sunken temple
[2:20:11] MaisLa0712: perhaps its about the size too im sure
[2:20:13] grizzlyhead: What about BRD? they will most likely make it into a raid @Xaryu
[2:20:13] Deomas11: BRD won't be touched
[2:20:14] HelluvaWrecks: what are other less popular dungeons going forward?
[2:20:14] serverfirst300003: @darth_honeybadger ban that guy
[2:20:21] handy_grenade: wasnt gnomer popular tho?
[2:20:22] lloydimus: @warpot0305  yup
[2:20:22] supermaduro24: wait are take away BFD away ?
[2:20:24] ralphh1541: ST is gonna be the 50 raid is my guess
[2:20:27] wreck561: oh god mara or ST are gonna be the next raid :(
[2:20:29] kiefxd: there are guilds on crusader strike horde side saying they wont take the portals, there will be a gigantic raid heading in from wetlands into loch into dun, attacking the alliance hopfully it's a huge battle
[2:20:29] LikeToad: people dont even do the entire gnomer dungeon xD
[2:20:33] JuggerNot_76: @d_droplet In 2024 to some people yes, not to me
[2:20:34] x_praxy_x: Mara would be a nice place to turn into a raid
[2:20:35] boostedeg93: Get ready for an uldum raid at 50
[2:20:38] jaylen4pres: @ralphh1541 that would be dope but tight quarters for 10 ppl
[2:20:39] yoslo1: I think the raid will be BRD
[2:20:46] Frostlicious: Mara i think will be next
[2:20:47] berserage95: like what in sod is actually new? runes are retail and raid is just dungeons with 1 boss mechanics, its lazy af
[2:20:48] slapshotsd: @wreck561 i'd love a good mara rework tbh
[2:20:55] oompous: a BRD raid would be nutty
[2:20:59] Knocktoff: @boostedeg93 oh god i cant image 10 in that small dungeon KEKW
[2:21:00] Varels1: I love gnomer. once per character for all the quests and with an experienced guide taking us where we need to go
[2:21:00] oompous: 40man
[2:21:07] grizzlyhead: i think so aswell @yoslo1
[2:21:07] polesreport: the backlash if they did BRD would be huge if they did anything wrong to it
[2:21:09] testiklees3: you gues was wrong, but good point xar
[2:21:09] Arandur87: lvl 50 Raid will be Temple
[2:21:09] ama__deus: @yoslo1 BRD is already a pretty cool dungeon, though. Doubt they'll take that away for a raid
[2:21:13] Mahca_: keep brd an epic dungeon
[2:21:17] Goggeman: sunken temple 100% is 50 raid
[2:21:23] Dellagardie: is 60 p3?
[2:21:24] d_droplet: @JuggerNot_76 i don't understand why common knowledge is offensive, people have known it for thousands of years and now it's offensive? jesus christ..
[2:21:30] ama__deus: A *NEW* raid for 50 would be amazing, though
[2:21:31] jaylen4pres: BRD raid would be fun but might need a weekly reset instead of every 3 days, place is massive
[2:21:31] polesreport: 50 is p3
[2:21:34] Goggeman: @dellagardie no
[2:21:36] BombDiggy: @Goggeman agreed
[2:21:41] Knocktoff: @boostedeg93 wait nvm got confused with uldaman
[2:21:45] yoslo1: @ama__deus whatever it is will be POGCRAZY
[2:21:46] alexgoat94: you can hold multiple supply boxes no
[2:21:48] Heazzly: @Goggeman SM is 50 raid..
[2:21:52] butterzugzug: @Goggeman 100% agree. sunken temple is for both kinda simmilar to reach and not the most loved 5man in the range
[2:21:56] bassiemon123: Hahahah byeee sweaty box stackers. Actually funny af xd
[2:21:57] ooTHExTUBEoo: supply boxes are (unique 12) as of now
[2:21:59] Whitemamba236: you can carry 12 supply boxes now
[2:22:00] Aduvanas: @Xaryu Enshrouded patch note: "Nerfed the skill “Water Aura”. It was just too good." :DDD
[2:22:02] oompous: @Heazzly where is that confirmed?
[2:22:03] MongoSecurity: KEKL
[2:22:03] FalanthosDB: thank god
[2:22:04] fetza108: niiiiiiiiiiice

[2:22:09] Tropicocity: @ooTHExTUBEoo is this live on NA?
[2:22:10] Fredthegred: finally
[2:22:14] ooTHExTUBEoo: @ooTHExTUBEoo yes
[2:22:15] Heazzly: @oompous ehm.. blizzcon..
[2:22:16] VLLN: That change is already live
[2:22:20] fetza108: these devs are great
[2:22:20] Trav_Where: If the portal to the raid is a quest again, isn't it going to be a huge pain for horde to get to gnomes the first time?
[2:22:24] berserage95: this chick is cool she adds a bit of personality to the announcements
[2:22:26] cthreeplo: @berserage95 personally as a lock tank, it feels like a massive change being even more tanky
[2:22:32] jaylen4pres: @jaylen4pres lolol exactly. "no i can't explain without being offensive but i'm definitely right"
[2:22:38] oompous: @Heazzly they teased kara crypts too. but they said it doesnt necessarily mean itll be in the game.
[2:22:39] VLLN: @Knaxxis ive picked two up
[2:22:41] chr47: @Trav_Where they already have a portal in booty bay
[2:22:44] ama__deus: @Trav_Where the quest is just to go to booty bay
[2:22:45] TodBobertson: L
[2:22:47] Vesir_1: rip
[2:22:47] Mammamia007: sad
[2:22:47] TheMightis: L
[2:22:47] ScryerTV: L

[2:22:55] TMMOOF: L
[2:22:57] Tukinik: Guys he is watching a video about the interview, he is not in the interview stop asking questions.....
[2:22:57] Darfrai: W
[2:22:57] Thulge: my druid needs dual spec bad lol
[2:22:59] zZmBz: lol like how much is there to consider? its a no brainer
[2:23:01] Krex0r: BIG L
[2:23:03] FOhBOz: So if did not farm the boxes yet its prob better to wait for p2 since i cant carry more and dont need to run back all the time?
[2:23:04] Kanhelx: W
[2:23:06] YzieGG: make a questline pls
[2:23:08] dramajohns: L but W later
[2:23:09] grimnor375: shit answer
[2:23:10] goochyboi: god i cant wait to camp horde all day coming into gnomer going to be so much fun
[2:23:11] qvantum91: totally fine
[2:23:12] handy_grenade: LLLLLL
[2:23:12] slapshotsd: @jaylen4pres no dude just some forums aren't the best for every topic, if you actually cared about this stuff you'd ask in places that could deconstruct it for you
[2:23:13] ooTHExTUBEoo: W
[2:23:14] inspect4: L
[2:23:15] CygnusC: respec is only 1g
[2:23:16] TMMOOF: pve/pvp
[2:23:17] handy_grenade: GIVE ME DUAL SPEC
[2:23:18] Zashooo: its fine yes
[2:23:19] dildyj: bro you can swap runes on the fly its okay
[2:23:20] eliwood63: 100% gonna happen at 50
[2:23:20] Krekdent: W
[2:23:21] Cenarios13: respec is so cheap now its fine
[2:23:21] PolarB91: if respecc is cheap its not so bad
[2:23:21] frederikv225: that's good
[2:23:21] GolDLaux: Fine. Wait until 50 or 60.
[2:23:22] ediblemaster: Wow players 2 picky
[2:23:22] BombDiggy: repspecing is cheap its fine
[2:23:23] TodBobertson: @Tukinik LOL People can ask what they want bud, don't be a nazi.
[2:23:23] Krex0r: Season of Discovery to not be able to discover
[2:23:24] Knocktoff: i think theyre going to see how upset people are and add it sooner than expected
[2:23:25] Darfrai: WWW
[2:23:26] The_RightTwix: Dual spec is one of the best things they have ever added to the game
[2:23:29] Darfrai: WW
[2:23:29] hagbulbia: UNLOCK THE GODDAMN LIVING SERVER AND SF
[2:23:29] christiangodwarrior97: whats the reason to not have it in 40
[2:23:30] jumpalottahigh: nah p2 kinda made sense already
[2:23:30] Lewbra: i just want a pvp and pve spec
[2:23:30] tsetse2fly: The respec is 1g max anyways
[2:23:31] probeu: dual spec is a lot less necessary with dirt cheap respec costs
[2:23:35] handy_grenade: ive spent like 20g on respec comon
[2:23:36] zZmBz: just encourages raid logging
[2:23:37] zZmBz: imo
[2:23:38] grylz89: It'll. E
[2:23:39] ediblemaster: I can raid with my pvp spec and clear it no prob
[2:23:42] grimnor375: it doesn't have to be a gold sink or anything. just let people play the different possibilities added with all the runes. jesus
[2:23:43] friarsthehobbit: so heres the thing with dual spec, NOT having it simply just screws over healers more than anyone else
[2:23:44] chr47: Just keep respecs cheap as fuck
[2:23:44] zZmBz: no dual spec = lots more raid loggers
[2:23:46] Frostlicious: 900g to buy Kappa
[2:23:50] grimnor375: people are so damn uptight about some of these things
[2:23:51] Rapapep: @dildyj makes sense when the content is not challenging.
[2:23:52] moonman42000: how long til we can start leveling? :)
[2:23:55] dramajohns: it will cost insane I bet like 1-2k at least
[2:23:57] TMMOOF: @bootsbackpacks  truth
[2:23:58] jaylen4pres: @slapshotsd *jingles keys*
[2:24:00] Twerkinrogue: someone said those tomes are already live
[2:24:02] Mahca_: imo dual spec isn’t needed but idk give it to people
[2:24:04] largist_: fair enough, would just be cool to have pvp and pve builds on hand
[2:24:10] TheMightis: How about Totemic Recall...
[2:24:11] ruperttheyeti: blessings big W
[2:24:11] berserage95: more QOL so retail? LUL classic players dont even know
[2:24:12] zodd_amhai: what sort of obvious question is that
[2:24:16] handy_grenade: this guy is him
[2:24:19] Jubilation12: @Mahca_ i feel like its needed for classes like druid
[2:24:28] slapshotsd: @jaylen4pres exactly my point
[2:24:36] Mahca_: @jubilation12 I main Druid for years and not needed imo
[2:24:39] rollinsthechamp: @cory_lockman LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:24:41] KKonaStevieG: what would be awesome is dragon flying Kappa
[2:24:42] FOhBOz: So if did not farm the boxes yet its prob better to wait for p2 since i cant carry more and dont need to run back all the time?
[2:24:42] ediblemaster: 1g is 1 dungeon item vendored at lvl40. Or 1 green web..
[2:24:45] Dratel: i do believe totemic recall and redirect is confirmed @TheMightis
[2:24:45] Frostlicious: @dramajohns Im thinking 100g since quest are 1-2 each
[2:24:47] jaylen4pres: @slapshotsd your not making one
[2:24:48] napparandre: He/him pepethink ?
[2:24:49] ralphh1541: if they don't increase the respec cost then I don't think we need dual spec
[2:24:49] christiangodwarrior97: what exactly are the reasons to not have dual spec in p2?
[2:25:01] slapshotsd: @jaylen4pres see you do get it
[2:25:02] wolfeyes91: !drama
[2:25:03] StreamElements: https://clips.twitch.tv/ApatheticPrettiestBottleTBCheesePull-v6SbMLiJJHjS3F2Y
[2:25:11] Mahca_: @ralphh1541 same, keep respec low or dual spec but not both
[2:25:13] Jubilation12: @dramajohns definitely not 1-2k lol
[2:25:19] grimnor375: @christiangodwarrior97 Its not mai classic. booshit if you put other stuff in <- sarcasm
[2:25:20] junckster: "come up with creative solutions" ...rehashing abilities from future expansions... right
[2:25:21] ruperttheyeti: xdd
[2:25:30] ediblemaster: @christiangodwarrior97 content can be cleared in any spec. 1 green p2 item is worth 3 respecs
[2:25:30] ConceptualDesigns: o shit 50% exp buff is live rn
[2:25:34] YzieGG: finally classic has a good team they realy see the whole game
[2:25:34] Gortan: ok who on the team hates hunters
[2:25:36] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[2:25:44] grizzlyhead: How about giving warrior spell reflect MadgeLate
[2:25:45] Varels1: @Gortan all of them LUL
[2:25:49] christiangodwarrior97: @ediblemaster same goes for lvl 60 tho
[2:25:51] jaylen4pres: @slapshotsd thanks for providing a safe space for me to figure it out on my own
[2:25:54] creedknows: like hunter pets in P1
[2:25:59] MongoSecurity: I love my hunter x(
[2:25:59] Zashooo: w
[2:26:01] TheSillyGooseGang: Boomies needs a NERF!!!!
[2:26:08] dramajohns: @Frostlicious there is no way its that cheap. it will cost like at least like the epic mount. its a gold "dump" as he said.
[2:26:10] the_moist_factory: Hey question on the otk tournament.. can only certain people apply? Or can anyone try out on March 15th?
[2:26:17] sharky_exp: agreed
[2:26:17] berserage95: are the people being interviewed the only 2 devs who work on sod?
[2:26:19] paraflashtv: she said it. no balance in wow.
[2:26:20] neimac2: 1 shots for everyone lets goo
[2:26:22] cthreeplo: @christiangodwarrior97 people will roll need on all your shit if leather just for their other 2 specs; especially in a pug raid
[2:26:28] creedknows: like certain classes should be better then other classes period.
[2:26:30] Krex0r: Easy to say for a mage and rogue main ;P
[2:26:30] ama__deus: @the_moist_factory it's an invitational, so only people who got invited can compete
[2:26:34] ediblemaster: @christiangodwarrior97 yeah idm. It's not a hill I'm willing to die on. Idc
[2:26:38] Goated_Goods: No homogenization Retail! xarGratitude
[2:26:38] Varels1: warlocks seem a bit strong... nerf hunters
[2:26:40] Mahca_: people try to make the game too competitive
[2:26:43] taylorsdank: @the_moist_factory its invitational
[2:26:43] geennaamnl1: Some classes are good in pve , some less good in pve. Some are therefor better in pvp and some not.
[2:26:44] king___slender: You want balance GTFO to retail
[2:26:44] christiangodwarrior97: @cthreeplo MS > OS masterroll?=
[2:26:52] the_moist_factory: Lame.. I would of loved to test my skill
[2:26:52] belleboysde: best example arcane mage, p2 sod it will be the best arcane mage we ever got. Not that boring
[2:27:06] Bobzoor: she is so damn cute
[2:27:15] creedknows: I agree xaryu.
[2:27:16] handy_grenade: ?
[2:27:17] fartguyl: @Bobzoor chill
[2:27:20] ooTHExTUBEoo: Different classes are better at different things
[2:27:22] Mahca_: same
[2:27:24] Dash4cash723: 140p intereview, expected from blizzard

[2:27:28] handy_grenade: i bodies like 20 warrios on rogue last night lol
[2:27:32] TheSward: agreed, everything being homogenized in retail is boring
[2:27:32] handy_grenade: but fuck prot
[2:27:35] Krex0r: True
[2:27:35] VerdenTheBleak: With wbs warriors are better
[2:27:36] chr47: rogues and warrior might be close with all the warrior nerfs
[2:27:38] Mahca_: every class shouldn’t excel at everything all the time
[2:27:39] ThoR294: mage cant solo dungeons anymore KEKW
[2:27:39] Medinore: not anymore
[2:27:42] Udenwo: not anymore :D
[2:27:42] friarsthehobbit: not anymore
[2:27:45] Wutanggggg: okay now say that about warlock
[2:27:46] Tropicocity: They cant do that anymore, living flame healing nerfed
[2:27:46] fartguyl: @ThoR294 ur silly
[2:27:47] eliwood63: mages got nerfed into the ground
[2:27:47] ThoR294: RIP mages
[2:27:49] testiklees3: rogues are n1 i raids so they got most single target damage, not warrior...
[2:27:49] grillenemanja: Xaryu did someone pay you to try to promote the dead SoD ?
[2:27:50] superdupergrundy: even though dps might be higher people love playing their own class
[2:27:53] Mico027: beloew 80 percentile its rogue, over it its warrior
[2:27:57] Bobzoor: @fartguyl u can chill bro=)
[2:27:58] ThoR294: @ThoR294 they nerfed regen

[2:28:17] fetza108: rogues yeah
[2:28:18] probeu: W take
[2:28:18] JihnFei: @ThoR294 brother mages have been aoe farming without regen for YEARS. they will find a way
[2:28:19] d0mezg4mer: to me the boring is the overall class balance feels very similar to og classic. warrior and rogue on top, big drop off, everyone else. all the new runes etc feel less impactful when the tuning ends up the same
[2:28:20] cthreeplo: locks destroy melee, im satisfied with that
[2:28:23] Beggebin: Portals, lockpicking, summoning
[2:28:29] scottydripn: indeed. rogues are the best at getting pulled out of stealth
[2:28:30] Zownos: yeah, agreed, classic bring that fun nuisance to the game. Find your niche baby! @Xaryu
[2:28:33] wowkekw28: windfury yikes
[2:28:33] NutterCircus: Blizzard is obviously required to have pronouns KEKL
[2:28:35] Jubilation12: @JihnFei decades now LUL
[2:28:38] Varels1: perfectly balanced is mirror match. boring
[2:28:41] JamTank: What does pally do lmaooo
[2:28:44] TurdBurgison: @grillenemanja did someone pay you to come in and be cringe
[2:28:45] YzieGG: or all classes are the same like in retail
[2:28:45] Krekdent: there is no fun if every class are equal or able to everything
[2:28:47] ThoR294: @JihnFei oh i know lol just the new way was nerfed
[2:28:52] ScarletPaladin: mop completely blurred it
[2:28:53] Krekdent: able to do*
[2:28:56] aequitas987: "loose" balance is very classic wow to me, gives it alot of character. everything is good at something
[2:28:58] sharky_exp: yup and i hate that
[2:28:59] KKonaStevieG: @JamTank give buffs KEKW
[2:28:59] TheMightis: I wish Class Identity would come back to Retail...
[2:28:59] ama__deus: @Judge_Dredd__ KEKBye
[2:29:02] subbyye: @ThoR294 no they didnt
[2:29:02] esyoti: amen
[2:29:02] simplegeoffy: One of the saddest days ever for me was when every class got bloodlust.
[2:29:03] warbux2: resto druids had ice block in mop lol
[2:29:04] NailnScrew: i was pretty sad when my mage had less magical range than a druid, but they fixed it
[2:29:04] ruperttheyeti: RIPBOZO
[2:29:07] ognizzler: RIPBOZO
[2:29:08] ThoR294: @ThoR294 yes they did
