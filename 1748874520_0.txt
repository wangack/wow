[0:11:48] Eploar: What are the dungeon ban rules? Can they ban any they want or?
[0:12:03] moderatygos: each series has a pool and they can ban any except the first dungeon
[0:12:31] Eploar: Ah, so that explains why they will run CoS this turn
[0:12:37] moderatygos: so when the dungeons are display on screen they are displayed in order that they will be played, the first dungeon is required to be played, any of the others can be banned, teams do not know which dungeon the other team is banning, which is why sometimes they both ban the same one
