[0:37:38] Einzbern: What did Tobo play for Echo? And what will he be playing for Liquid?
[0:37:38] burne114: Was this MDI team with Yipz purely a ploy to poach him?

[0:40:46] Malicone: who left echo? i cant hear you
[0:40:48] Madcatmk02: courted
[0:40:48] tagzin_: like the egg
[0:40:48] burne114: Like an egg
[0:40:49] mstr_shake: cooked in hot water
[0:40:50] kags158: poached = stolen.
[0:40:52] walmartpjs: incentivize a player to leave their guild prob
[0:40:52] Gutshots: like the egg
[0:40:53] zannuss: it's a method of cooking an egg
[0:40:55] m1lkman10: Poach is like a way of cooking an egg
[0:40:55] Xandid: Maybe it means offer to pay him more
[0:40:56] zorachTTV: You target him to "steal" him away
[0:40:57] goesidd: Headhunted
[0:40:58] ArcaneSyntax: Poached is like boiling an egg outside the shell
[0:40:59] MisterNioce: went out of your way to get them
[0:40:59] Benjg7: EU people think you’re stealing echo raiders by offering more money
[0:41:02] Untaint3d: nah poached is liquid approached him to join
[0:41:02] sedael: i think they mean you approached vs he approached
[0:41:07] goesidd: U wanted him not he wanted you
[0:41:09] JohnAllenCasts: poached is more like liquid came to him rather than him coming to liquid for the transfer
[0:41:11] trevor_sub: poached to me in this case it just paying him more
[0:41:11] GnarstyTV: You shot Tobo out of season.
[0:41:17] Therealbrokensword: one mans "poached" is another mans "recruited"
[0:41:18] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT
[0:41:19] JamesTiedye: It's kind of like bribery
[0:41:20] halfwaythug: lol
[0:41:20] JmantheThief: poached means you head-hunted vs him applying
[0:41:27] menzlo: Echo firedup woo
[0:41:29] BigCizzle: CAUGHT
[0:41:33] Madcatmk02: Makes sense now that you mention it but I wouldn't have figured that
[0:41:36] Spritesgud: except gingi, he's like the major villain of the NA superhero arc
[0:41:38] wafflerboss: bro called a job bribery
[0:41:40] wafflerboss: like what
[0:41:42] lastericalive: it's professional gaming, it's not a bribe
[0:41:47] BipolarPongal: Tobo left for more money,confirmed
[0:41:58] goesidd: Jobs are kinda bribery, I wouldnt do my job for free
[0:42:15] jukla12: KEKW
[0:42:15] majestictaco0: has he talked about what role he's playing? still aug even though goop and sang exist or what?
[0:42:16] panta_xdd: thats a vibe
[0:42:18] burne114: Early release = better raiding hours
[0:42:21] Benjg7: either way, why wouldn’t someone leave for better money?
[0:42:22] Madcatmk02: I dunno a NZ players just reached out to my NA guild for better raiding hours LOL
[0:42:25] doublebogey: wallstreetbets lmao
[0:42:26] ArcaneSyntax: Max takes a long drag on his cigar, "we're ready to make you an offer" he says as he slides a manilla envelope full of 20s across the desk
[0:42:26] jukla12: git gud bro
[0:42:27] spivet: still not over how fucking terrible new reddit is
[0:42:29] Manu7: new design is so bad
[0:42:30] GodKingMuninn: reddits redesign is dogshit though
[0:42:31] walmartpjs: reddit doesnt make it easy KEKW
[0:42:31] Darkshore_Capital: change the www to old in the url
[0:42:32] halfwaythug: might fit a gamers sleeping schedule :D
[0:42:33] keleksbreath: it's not you it's the shitty website
[0:42:33] MightyBone_Yumuros: reddits old interface was better
[0:42:34] Aosin_: ***dit
[0:42:36] drbonesawmd: Max, could liquid sponsor a US visa since its a US based company?
[0:42:38] a_ZumA: ***dit only way
[0:42:40] spivet: do old reddit its easier
[0:42:41] Thdlock: change the www to old
[0:42:41] keleksbreath: current UI is garbage
[0:42:41] daevyfan: use old reddit
[0:42:43] FrilleJr: old reddit is easier to read
[0:42:43] Thdlock: its the best way
[0:43:00] Spritesgud: change www to old
[0:43:00] lumaday: ***dit
[0:43:01] Dzor12: Old dot Reddit
[0:43:03] jukla12: ***dit
[0:43:03] sedael: ***dit -> ***dit
[0:43:03] keleksbreath: ***
[0:43:04] Darkshore_Capital: literally just replace www with old and then hit enter
[0:43:05] aedra_gg: yeah, just ***
[0:43:07] Spritesgud: yes
[0:43:07] Thdlock: its old.reddit
[0:43:08] Littleguyz: old dot reddit
[0:43:09] muonz: max is the most boomer gamer in existence
[0:43:11] Thdlock: instead of www.reddit
[0:43:18] thenateo2: new reddit kekw
[0:43:23] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Should mod THD for that comment
[0:43:24] Littleguyz: Theres a chrome plugin that forces that link
[0:43:28] wafflerboss: new design is like a decade old still dogshit
[0:43:32] aLLkiss: imagine not using old
[0:43:40] Zarroe: xdd
[0:43:50] m1lkman10: These takes aren't that funny
[0:43:50] conxzz: check scrype post
[0:43:59] nKs_0: By better raiding hours I imagine they mean, he won't have to come to Farm raid as much as on Echo @Maximum
[0:44:18] codydoubleu: naowh is still echo for MDI as well, not a close comparison
[0:44:18] Spritesgud: thats me holy
[0:44:20] BipolarPongal: bro waffling
[0:44:24] gloop1: seems like just a good practice to me to remove people who leave?
[0:44:34] tagzin_: could be in case they log in during the race and see some hidden teh
[0:44:40] aLLkiss: @Spritesgud Chatting HOLY
[0:44:41] tagzin_: rech*
[0:44:41] Kahjonaata: tough to be 2nd it seems
[0:44:51] Spritesgud: @aLLkiss !!!!
[0:45:06] pnguinwow: ye dbm
[0:45:16] FrilleJr: HACKERMANS
[0:45:35] sedael: makin shit up on reddit? never
[0:45:40] burne114: People would do that??? Just yap on the internet???
[0:45:48] isFeyz: this is one of the most reddit reddit post ever lmao
[0:45:48] JohnAllenCasts: how seriously are echo and liquid gonna take fated do you think?
[0:45:50] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[0:45:50] Jumanjiqt: How dies it work with going from raiding in an EU guild to NA guild anyway, do you just have to make all fresh chars on NA servers? or can you transfer
[0:46:07] Spritesgud: @Jumanjiqt all new, hopeful is going through that now
[0:46:08] burne114: @Jumanjiqt I imagine Liquid would help pay for transfers
[0:46:21] Spritesgud: @burne114 can't transfer from EU to NA
[0:46:48] thenateo2: people think rwf guilds operate like lower rank guilds
[0:46:49] thenateo2: thats why
[0:46:50] goesidd: Recruited not applied
[0:46:57] malnourish_: its meant bad
[0:47:00] malnourish_: derogatory
[0:47:01] JmantheThief: poach = headhunted
[0:47:01] pnguinwow: poach usually means devious means of acquiring
[0:47:03] tanikins: So if Tobo reached out to you all first, that technically wouldnt be a poach
[0:47:05] starymnw: "steal"
[0:47:06] burne114: @Spritesgud okay yea but Im an idiot so I just say stuff that I don't know anything about, so
[0:47:07] Moonasaurusrex: ill intentions
[0:47:08] Zaisx: poach means you approached them typically vs him approaching you
[0:47:11] zorachTTV: Poaching is specifically you targeting him and "stealing" him
[0:47:11] DrQuackzalver: If you reach out, it's poaching
[0:47:13] captnmichael: Poach= You reach first. Otherwise he reaches first
[0:47:13] Manu7: its just getting recruited from the competitor
[0:47:14] chubbytheboi: They assume taht you put a gun to his head and made him do it LUL
[0:47:14] BigCizzle: some people get really salty about a different guild reaching out to their raiders
[0:47:15] conxzz: who's spot is he taking??
[0:47:16] goesidd: It means recruited not applied
[0:47:17] codydoubleu: poach insinuates their mind was changed
[0:47:17] Upsidedownsmiling: they mean like doing it in a nefarious way @Maximum
[0:47:23] wafflerboss: no one is applying to liquid, its all headhunting
[0:47:33] aenoswe: poach has the same meaning as someone approaching someone else with an offer.
[0:47:34] Fredo90i: poach is just stolen but not in a bad way
[0:47:36] Madcatmk02: It's definitely recruited vs applied, I think the general populous myself included didn't think you messaged each others players. It makes sense that you do that though
[0:47:38] Oracle_WoW: Its how you do your eggs for Eggs Benedict
[0:47:39] burne114: But you gaslight them into
[0:47:42] Spritesgud: no poached is literally just like in pro sports when other teams yoink players
[0:47:44] ToxicLG: Poaching isn't necessarily a bad thing - it just means you approached him with an offer to join rather than he approached you
[0:47:47] PrimevalOne69: Mind Control
[0:47:48] freddergangster: you made an offer he couldnt refuse
[0:47:48] chubbytheboi: Max you doing Inception shit now?
[0:47:51] Therealbrokensword: yeah I think that's framing it negatively, its clearly just a high profile recruitment
[0:47:52] Spritesgud: people overcomplicate it
[0:47:52] JamesTiedye: I was mistaken earlier, poaching in like esport cases is bypassing a contract or not talking to the org and going right to the player.
[0:47:52] burne114: He changed teams because of the implication
[0:47:53] BipolarPongal: WideTHD
[0:47:56] keleksbreath: can you poach me???
[0:47:58] Danglyys: @Maximum there's nothing more to poaching other than you actively seeking to recruit player  from another guild. The part of it that makes it poaching is that your guild is reaching out to another guild's players. That's it, nothing more
[0:48:00] scorgie1994: i dont think it really applied to the rwf guilds, there's no structured or officiated league/tourneys. no rules to be broken
[0:48:02] aLLkiss: Poached means you came to him not he came to you simple as that
[0:48:09] NovemberFifth: Mr steal your girl
[0:48:11] Thdlock: I APPED BUDDY WideTHD
[0:48:11] bloodbane1738: any Balatro today? @Maximum
[0:48:11] shameshady: poached is "stealing"
[0:48:13] nKs_0: who was interested first?
[0:48:15] Madcatmk02: Which is fine but I think that's the term difference between recruited and poached
[0:48:16] tagzin_: is tobo doing MDI with any liquid raiders?
[0:48:28] burne114: @tagzin_ Yipz
[0:48:52] muonz: i mean non-mutual recruiting never works out at any level lol
[0:48:52] gputty: how does the ping factor in though?
[0:48:53] leubinator: WideTHD
[0:48:57] DrQuackzalver: yeah, that's not how it works everywhere else
[0:49:00] ToxicLG: I think that's what they mean - you guys poach between each other's guilds that's just how it is
[0:49:07] nemziac: probably because of who tobo was on the rwf broadcast for them
[0:49:08] Oracle_WoW: echo and liquid should just team up and take down blizzard together
[0:49:09] JamesTiedye: Us normies have no idea on the etiquette when it comes to this
[0:49:09] goesidd: That is what it means yes
[0:49:13] Danglyys: RFW is poaching only EZ
[0:49:15] sedael: if the guild i like gets someone good its recruiting, if the guild i dont like gets someone good its poaching
[0:49:17] imjp21: yipz mdi tobo recruitment ploy complete.
[0:49:23] mstr_shake: you scooped him
[0:49:25] nemziac: talked about him a ton and less so the other players that have changed
[0:49:25] pnguinwow: is he doing any mdi stuff with liquid
[0:49:28] JmantheThief: you didn't poach JPC :P
[0:49:29] Guko97: you talking to them rather than them aproching you?
[0:49:56] conxzz: ksp?
[0:50:10] daiger5o: Like a toxic gf?
[0:50:11] LudganTV: Counter pick
[0:50:21] kags158: scroll down - someone says that
[0:50:29] Spritesgud: make hopeful ride the bench to gimp echo gigachat
[0:50:41] nKs_0: Echo has an application process, different methods I guess.
[0:50:43] krepzyy: Scripe whispered me last week with an offer, wanna recruit me to Liquid?
[0:50:46] Ignite_CLO: kansas city signing josh allen to put him on their bench Kappa
[0:50:49] BipolarPongal: are you implying Echo doesn't have good mages
[0:50:52] Spritoholic: its so damn hard to find a guild when ur new
[0:51:01] egryn: YOO
[0:51:04] cyapat1: True

[0:51:43] wafflerboss: im the third best mage in the world no one can verify so its real
[0:51:49] ShadesOBlue: People love top 10 lists
[0:51:57] Danglyys: well that's why he said "very likely" which is carrying a lot of weight, but the caveat is there
[0:51:59] Guko97: man ppl in my guild say gingi is bad frequently, ppl bad on mages alot
[0:52:04] NaBNez: yep well oiled
[0:52:05] N3llee: just saw dune.. it was good.
[0:52:06] Guko97: bag*
[0:52:08] scorgie1994: well he wouldnt just make stuff up on reddit so he must know what he's talking about
[0:52:12] goesidd: Didnt Hopeful play for ID? They did hard tindral no?
[0:52:21] cyapat1: Uncontested baseg
[0:52:30] burne114: I'
[0:52:32] MorpheenBE: The GOAT baseg
[0:52:33] malnourish_: amen

[1:15:27] Madcatmk02: I agree with Coral
[1:15:27] Piki9: Did you ever get around to reading that Mythic wow forum post? @Maximum
[1:15:28] Tremoss: What addons get you this style of UI?
[1:15:29] kingcrow730: salmon is just an orangey shade of pink

[1:16:21] MrGharr: do they increase dungeon levels?
[1:16:35] JBugaboo: mmr is cooked in pvp
[1:16:47] NaBNez: defensive need to go WideTHD
[1:16:47] surpriseparty20: I'm at the point u were talking about the talent trees.
[1:16:50] JBugaboo: imagine being capped to doing +10s for 3 months when +20 gives rewards
[1:16:55] yrp01: yeah they gave alot of stuff out
[1:17:01] theweirdsquiggly: remove defensives, give healers 100% control over health bars
[1:17:07] kallisz: @MrGharr huh? higher than infinite?
[1:17:07] auby6: prune
[1:17:10] yrp01: theres a bloat in general so much so alot of the hero trees are just giga passives
[1:17:18] caveman2x: the perfect talent system is somewhere inbetween what we had and what we have no i just dk what it is
[1:17:19] ShadesOBlue: Or power ups
[1:17:22] thenateo2: @theweirdsquiggly that sounds like a terrible idea lol
[1:17:23] nKs_0: 45% vers stacking
[1:17:23] ShadesOBlue: In pvp
[1:17:23] BloodyAxe: feint is wild
[1:17:24] Dacoolface: Resilience will fix it
[1:17:24] NaBNez: maybe not from shaman tho
[1:17:26] MrGharr: @kallisz for MDI finals
[1:17:33] gloop1: Vers is just so boring and uninspired
[1:17:34] gputty: well, not shaman
[1:17:34] Guko97: EXCEPT for tanks! let tanks be good
[1:17:38] ctg_dreamz: They need to rework the Lakers talent trees because their defense is ass
[1:17:42] menzlo: Directions unclear, barkskin now only 10% dr
[1:17:43] Guko97: Tanks being able to self sustain is bis
[1:17:46] heloraeon: defensives should last longer but have a much lower defensive value? then just ramp rot damage maybe?
[1:17:47] halfwaythug: vers has allways been the msot boring stat ever
[1:17:48] kallisz: @MrGharr ohh, makes sense, my b
[1:17:52] BloodyAxe: bring back multistrike!!
[1:17:52] Madcatmk02: Laughs in healer priest >.>
[1:18:00] shagamuffn: I hate playing vers class, feels good early in the season but the more gear the further behind you feel
[1:18:04] antipheonixna: replace vers with corruption Wokege
[1:18:06] Zekiram2000: vers for tanks only i say
[1:18:07] fleks27: gotta compare vers to multistrike, and the latter had interactions with procs and stuff - vers is just boring by comparison
[1:18:10] GrimFandango: They can't remove Verse in PvE though because specs like WW and Ret would just get destroyed from bad other secondary scaling, right?
[1:18:11] kallisz: one shots should be fuck ups
[1:18:16] Robbary90: Oh I wish I could watch Dune again! Bring blood pressure medication with you!!
[1:18:17] Ruinx81: One shots boring af
[1:18:18] GodKingMuninn: Bring everyone to ele level of defensiveness, watch the suffering
[1:18:31] AnarchyMoose: for pvp, if you remove defensives then you have to remove cooldowns
[1:18:35] goesidd: It makes healers lack agency too, healer doesnt decide if u live or die. U pressing wall or not decides
[1:18:47] heloraeon: so if we got rid of vers what do we replace it with? if we replace it at all.
[1:18:48] Orenria: Ye how about only for dps and heals cuz tank defenses feel way better this expac
[1:18:50] auby6: shamans have to play better than every other spec in the game defensively ... why is that a thing
[1:18:50] chubbytheboi: That's how I deal with bosses too. They either die or don't die
[1:18:53] antipheonixna: playing boomie and bear shifting to survive shit i dont do that on any other spec is cringe
[1:18:54] jesuslouise: just memorize every damage event as a casual player 4Head
[1:18:57] savasci16: has he talked about tobo already?
[1:19:05] amaysel: fist the buck3t
[1:19:06] MrGharr: affix idea: over +20 instead of increasing damage by 10%, just add constant rot damage, increasing by key level.
[1:19:06] burne114: Just make more rot damage and less burst damage, done
[1:19:10] heloraeon: @savasci16 yep
[1:19:12] Kamehameshaw: Can we bring back degenerate shaman crit healing from wrath and just spam chain heals?
[1:19:13] Ok_Kingston: I'm way more fine with mechanical difficulty > dying or not dying to the boss laughing at me
[1:19:16] chubbytheboi: Bring back pvp resilience and get vers the fuck out
[1:19:17] d0mezg4mer: what if vers just didnt get dr
[1:19:20] theweirdsquiggly: @goesidd 100% correct
[1:19:26] jandemain: one shots necessitate so many wa trackers as well
[1:19:26] savasci16: @heloraeon anything interesting?
[1:19:31] auby6: the ank tax @Maximum
[1:19:34] Standy94: But isn't it nice if vers is good for your class cause you get free DR
[1:19:44] fleks27: i was very surprised when the one mage hero talent tree we saw so far buffed their barrier
[1:19:45] grimzero617: As it was written
[1:19:45] Guko97: i agree but dont make tanks weaker please, its so nice to play atm @Maximum
[1:19:46] yrp01: is it worth capping vers lower than mastery/crit/haste ?
[1:19:49] xrandomdoodx: Poor Shaman never got to life that good defensive life, unless they nerf all classes to be like shaman defensively.
[1:19:50] ShadesOBlue: More dots, less one shots? Not sure what you're getting at
[1:19:51] Orenria: everyone but tanks tho
[1:20:06] heloraeon: @savasci16 I didnt really think so.
[1:20:11] pnguinwow: i think we should only get 1 maybe 2 defensives max
[1:20:12] Ruinx81: They are going to increase dmg and mob health again zzz
[1:20:15] AnarchyMoose: i think they should remove healers and only have support specs in the game. make people heal themselves.
[1:20:15] thegrt13: is it that the buttons are too good? or there is an abundance of buttons? or both
[1:20:21] menzlo: Perma regrowth 8%
[1:20:26] Standy94: Defensive hero talents is weird. Name 1 hero that is pog because they are defensive
[1:20:26] savasci16: @heloraeon alright, cheers lad!
[1:20:27] Namolia: Will Bonebaby ever make a return? :)
[1:20:33] M__Wolfe: DK's used to be insanely tanky but traded speed for it. You were slow but felt unstoppable. Now every class is jsut as tanky or tankier with none of the downisdes. Class deisgn has been flipped on its head
[1:20:34] shagamuffn: Ww doesn't need more, them dlfixing the auto attack bug would be nice though
[1:20:35] NaBNez: yes dont remove any defensive from shaman
[1:20:40] theweirdsquiggly: as a healer, I would love if every class had only one defensive and my kit was tuned around that. would be so much more fun to have full control over the party living
[1:20:41] Pyrrha_GG: they could be pulling some power out of the class/spec trees, we just dont have any idea what they have done with them for TWW
[1:20:48] chubbytheboi: @Standy94 For me - no. It just shows that the class devs don't know how to balance their class for it to use haste/mastery. Vers is a lazy stat
[1:20:59] d0mezg4mer: is the one shot thing a problem in heroic raid too or just mythic?
[1:21:01] MrGharr: or they should stagger all damage in M+
[1:21:10] fleks27: mage can lose 2 buttons and its fine
[1:21:11] Billiebanish: M+ can also be capped when you can't do enough damage to time it.
[1:21:11] abruptdecayO_O: 100% nerf
[1:21:16] Billiebanish: Not always a oneshot death.
[1:21:16] fleks27: can and should
[1:21:23] Standy94: They could just get rid of vers and add resilience back
[1:21:43] valdekius: I saw a very interesting video talking about how much more volatile healing is now. I agree with you. I think it's because they're trying to make healing more 'exciting'
[1:21:47] chubbytheboi: @Standy94 Voting with both hands for that
[1:21:48] Nagollith: What about Classes with massive self heals? DK...
[1:21:54] NaManDatAintMe: yeah everyone should get hunter survivability
[1:21:55] ntellectual_disability: mb ?
[1:21:57] NaManDatAintMe: xD
[1:22:00] Mkolle: Other way around for shaman
[1:22:03] ntellectual_disability: bm ?
[1:22:04] kallisz: m+ needs to be  based around doing it faster. give healers stuff to heal
[1:22:10] Standy94: They won't bring back resilience though. That would be to hard to admit a 12 year mistake
[1:22:10] M__Wolfe: They shouldve made the capstones in the class tree defensives and put all DPS in the spec tree
[1:22:16] xrandomdoodx: ele shaman literally lost their earth ele wall from SL Sadge
[1:22:17] grimzero617: It IS insane. That's several buttons. How can I press all my buttons AND gripe about it on the forums?
[1:22:19] NaBNez: yea mage does have very strong defensives and alot of em too
[1:22:21] charval: Remember in MoP when locks had "ember burn" where you could use your shards to heal overtime. MENTAL haha
[1:22:22] Aro725: Game is more fun with more defensives. Cause pugs and normy healers are not good at the game. I like being able to live if i use my defensives well.
[1:22:26] ShadesOBlue: They wanted more healer single targets healing
[1:22:27] iWatchPeoplePlayStuff: what did warriors get? shield block?
[1:22:30] procotwitch: sac 1min cd WITH dmg reduction lmao
[1:22:34] AnarchyMoose: max why do we even need to have challenging content for healers

[1:23:08] Capptain5: @Maximum you are looking better than a bowl of ice cream my guy
[1:23:11] kallisz: @Ruinx81 i dont think anyones arguing that, but state of the game is weird
[1:23:11] dorki: does healing always suck
[1:23:13] valdekius: Yeah I think that's the video I was referring to
[1:23:23] NaBNez: car

[1:23:47] hayuri4: @dorki Not sure about healing, but healers...
[1:23:50] fleks27: @dorki they always complain
[1:24:05] Madcatmk02: @dorki nah healing is typically great <3
[1:24:08] MrGharr: I quit healing when they made damage that spiky
[1:24:11] Standy94: I do no healing all the time so blizz should just buff me
[1:24:59] AnarchyMoose: what if we just didnt have challenging content for healers
[1:25:04] nalegi07: Xybeaned in the raid FeelsGoodMan
[1:25:05] keleksbreath: man I miss CN
[1:25:09] fleks27: so low dps lmao people really sucked in the past
[1:25:09] dknamey: damn wrath numbers in SL
[1:25:22] Teeemosh: @AnarchyMoose then bosses will be killed with 2 healers
[1:25:23] shagamuffn: Show razz play your health always was going to 10 percent to 100, the whole fight
[1:25:27] garkovankovic: that makes fyrakks intermission with orbs good? biiiig heal check?
[1:25:29] Maruika: power creep always fucks that
[1:25:38] hayuri4: Okay hear me out.... What if they remove healers? 5Head
[1:25:45] AnarchyMoose: @Teeemosh good. remove healers.
[1:25:45] maxmorey: So what you're saying is, everything needs to be as squishy as Boomkin NOTED
[1:25:48] NaBNez: that was with 5 healers too i think
[1:25:54] othernewname: @fleks27 Kappa
[1:25:54] malnourish_: @maximum what if they increased stamina pools?

[1:25:59] Florqt: @hayuri4 based
[1:26:01] just_ie: Did shaman gain more defensives in dragonflight? Only thing i could think of is enhance gaining AG again
[1:26:11] garkovankovic: that makes fyrakks intermission with orbs good? biiiig heal check?
[1:26:12] MrGharr: they can still help it by just tweaking numbers, more HP, less heal, less damage
[1:26:26] tingen2: next tier no healers first 5 bosses
[1:26:26] kallisz: a problem theyve made for themselves is that you need to set cds and is needed to top spikes7
[1:26:28] Orenria: Tanks really feel good rn if they had less buttons it becomes way less interesting in raid
[1:26:29] nalegi07: you 5 heal when your healers play like they have their monitors off Despairge
[1:26:30] C4leb0rn: thoughts on mistweaver?
[1:26:34] procotwitch: if I get nerfed cause you're speaking facts you're getting a hand written letter
[1:26:36] ostarodestroyero: how do the heartstone free mounts work?
[1:26:38] GrimFandango: what ilvl was the healer team on the Fyrakk kill @Maximum ?
[1:26:38] Clarius: they also just gave healers so many small cooldowns.. for example as Holy Pala u only had Wings and Ashen/Divine Toll on Sludgefist, now u have that + like 4 other cooldowns
[1:26:46] Zarroe: garf

[1:27:08] dustin_handsupdb: What about Warrior?
[1:27:08] Standy94: tank totem kinda fun
[1:27:10] AnarchyMoose: max what if the norm was to just have like 1 or 2 healers in raid and no healer at all in dungeons
[1:27:12] Azikielboi: druid class tree is 2nd most ass

[1:27:17] Jjmn12: thoughts on Shogun? Pog
[1:27:18] Florqt: they should replace the monk tree with a tree that is all the totems

[1:28:18] Teeemosh: Chatting
[1:28:20] kallisz: @just_ie ive played shaman and monk the whole of df. monks have no choice, shaman have plenty with impact
[1:28:24] heloraeon: tweeting like their careers depend on it.
[1:28:29] fleks27: @GrimFandango fair point

[1:29:09] nevoia: Ad I think is the best 4 dps key in this list
[1:29:09] walmartpjs: MD negates bursting for the most part right

[1:29:27] alarkin: The very first thing Venruki said about mythic though was that it's too hard, and I'm starting to wonder why this point is receiving a fraction of the attention of anything else, even though it's being repeated over and over - mythic is too hard.
[1:29:28] Littleguyz: They will figure something out

[1:49:57] DrQuackzalver: Prayge
[1:49:57] NeroTVWoW: The pvp changes are crazy
[1:49:57] zannuss: Slayer gonna be slaying
[1:49:58] Jarlan23: i think its safe to assume every class talent tree will get touched up a bit
[1:50:00] Hoshma46: Slayer execute useable as all health percentages Prayge
[1:50:03] leubinator: warrior tree getting unfucked after 2 years of suffering yay
[1:50:06] Guts4dinner: Slayer strongest execute in the game confirmed?
[1:50:11] ArcaneSyntax: I went to the paladin forums and there was a bunch of people complaining about having to take wake of ashes as ret.
[1:50:36] Flipeled: @Maximum go back they spoiled Slayer flavor
[1:50:39] Slapsstick: missed slayer reveal smh
[1:50:47] chubbytheboi: @ArcaneSyntax Wat? LUL
[1:50:49] aescend_: @Guts4dinner hopefully, makes no sense if the class that has the ability EXECUTE does not have the best execute
[1:50:58] BigCizzle: Pog
[1:51:01] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[1:51:03] Hoshma46: bind execute to spacebar LETSGO
[1:51:06] Clarius: Condemn Pog
[1:51:06] Diazanite: slayer better have overleech or that spec is just dead on arrival
[1:51:06] Guts4dinner: @aescend_ fingers crossed
[1:51:07] feodronn: poe vibes kinda
[1:51:07] RaderTader: BRING BACK CONDEMN
[1:51:10] Zarroe: legion execute ramps Pog
[1:51:11] d0mezg4mer: slayer I hardly know yer
[1:51:12] mandbyvgc: Slayer will be pog then
[1:51:13] antipheonixna: 1 node condemn
[1:51:13] oneifbyland: E X E C U T E  is back Pog
[1:51:14] Sch1ey: 1 button spec sch1eyFanfare
[1:51:14] periphrase: if they're going to keep adding talent trees every expac, how is it different than borrowed power
[1:51:16] just_ie: Do you think a dragonflight tree revamp can salvage the theme of totemic?
[1:51:27] gamatommy: cus fuck warrior they hate us
[1:51:29] Madcatmk02: that should be their niche for sure
[1:51:32] macstallion: Execution sentence
[1:51:36] Jarlan23: its supposed to be our niche that and 2 target cleave
[1:51:37] ArcaneSyntax: hammer of wrath is as old as execute
[1:51:41] chubbytheboi: Warriors have Execute, but the thing that actually executes is Touch of Death LUL
[1:51:43] Arcsu: why do rogues not have the best kick when kick is called kick 🤔
[1:51:45] RaderTader: condemn when?
[1:51:46] shagamuffn: They are, dude in guild does all his damage at the end of the boss fights
[1:51:47] mandbyvgc: Bro Arms is not even as good as Fury in execute. which is weird
[1:51:48] thenateo2: It was true last tier no?
[1:51:48] Hoshma46: they need the best priority damage in execute range of all classes
[1:51:49] ahri_feet_connoisseur: there has been a lack of class flavor for a very long time
[1:51:59] deviljin____: @gamatommy hey champ is everything ok with guildmates
[1:52:04] Morayeden: Zero chance they balance colossus and slayer
[1:52:05] xantaga: @mandbyvgc thats not true
[1:52:12] roberterino19: ye
[1:52:12] zannuss: When are warriors going to get a damn lust. It makes sense from every aspect of the game to give warriors a lust and it would give a tank spec a lust as well.
[1:52:24] Kryous: Sin ran so Sub could walk. salute
[1:52:25] Taytor: Wasn't venthyr warrior insane execute in Shadowlands?
[1:52:26] Guts4dinner: lucid dreams arms warrior was so fun, but that was only thanks to strength stacking
[1:52:29] Lindorn_: the argus memes, good times
[1:52:37] DankWizard420: legion execute Pog
[1:52:38] Jarlan23: and being an execute class just gets worse and worse as the patch advances
[1:52:39] spicykekw: @Maximum warriors need at least 3 yards meele range on abilities. its sad how its the only meele spec without any range lol
[1:52:41] Hoshma46: @zannuss a battle cry lust would be so Pog
[1:52:43] Diazanite: do not lie for fun @xantaga
[1:52:44] SlowboLaggins: @zannuss ive been saying the same thing for a long time now lol
[1:53:04] iWatchPeoplePlayStuff: what if...just hear me out, what if they just removed warrior from the game and just made a quest where you either became a Paladin or a DK. I don't think much would be lost.
[1:53:05] katericaaa: @spicykekw i have been saying this forever, we so desperately need this
[1:53:06] chubbytheboi: Then get 5 arms warriors? There you go, I solved all your RWF issues
[1:53:14] Snydezz: What class is the best execute in the game if not Arms Warrior?
[1:53:20] leubinator: ppl need to stop the bloodlust cope only the best ust gets invited to keys anyways
[1:53:25] Guts4dinner: "drums"
[1:53:26] NotD4k: NotD4k subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! dorkiPledge
[1:53:27] Jarlan23: id rather have stuff like a group spell reflect and things like that
[1:53:32] guynormally: every class could thematically have a lust
[1:53:44] DankWizard420: just make warriors a healer, let them shout Pog
[1:53:50] Hoshma46: @leubinator false, if a tank could bring lust that would be a huge reason to bring them
[1:53:50] spicykekw: @katericaaa some bosses feel so bad to play as a warrior due to 0 range on abilities
[1:53:51] menzlo: Is his name venruki
[1:53:52] KarmaXDx: Shroud?
[1:53:53] lumaday: Venruki is on your hockey team?
[1:53:58] Jarlan23: is he ryan reynolds
[1:53:59] smolderdaddyuwu: ryan renyolds?
[1:54:01] Smasher225: that's a canadian for you
[1:54:03] Clarius: LUL
[1:54:09] sethron: they kicked him out for that?
[1:54:15] brosciencegym: toadphPog  real person blood thirst

[1:54:23] Kamehameshaw: cali hockey be soft
[1:54:24] enigmasvea: what is blud waffling about
[1:54:27] Guts4dinner: kick the shit out an enemy so hard you inspire your allies
[1:54:27] mandbyvgc: what class are you IRL?
[1:54:29] bankermayfield: lmao bloodlust in hockey would go crazy
[1:54:31] Wafzig: Michigan Basketball player Zack Novak did that 10-12 years ago.  We call it the "Aneurysm of Leadership"
[1:54:35] chubbytheboi: To be fair "Bloodlust" suits warriors more than shamans
[1:54:36] its_blando: i thought squaring up in hockey was normal
[1:54:37] KillUAssie: skated hard for that last minute ? haha
[1:54:38] Monsuno: what do you look for in good skates?
[1:54:39] Jazrial: Its like Shorsey would say "gotta set the tone"

[2:08:50] Smasher225: after like 16 days
[2:08:50] Rhop: This sounds like a "never gonna happen on Max's stream" kinda angle
[2:08:51] JohnAllenCasts: yeah they beat loads of the series
[2:08:52] trentonlf: Might be fun until the trolls came out and did their best to make it not fun anymore

[2:09:50] DreadfuryDK: Did y'all miss Legends Arceus???
[2:09:52] DanteDemonZ: I just want a pokemon game that is in 60 fps and doesnt run like its on a toaster
[2:09:52] ztraws__: they have gone way downhill
[2:09:53] slappadabas5: Have you been playing them?
[2:09:54] leubinator: pokemon is just palworld at home
[2:09:56] megakenny: Never, they'll keep releasing shit because they dont need to make them good to sell millions of copies
[2:09:56] veiloflonelystars: only old pokemon games were good
[2:09:56] zannuss: I only ever played the original pokemon red
[2:09:56] yuhhhhe: the re-realesed mega evolutions to compensate for palworld wihch is ass
[2:10:01] HarmlessCurse: but they make money being trash\
[2:10:02] Upsidedownsmiling: they are built like dogshit it will never be good
[2:10:04] DanteDemonZ: it would help if the switch wasnt a microwave in terms of hardware
[2:10:07] ArcaneSyntax: competitive pokemon is great imo
[2:10:07] RaiNeRpm: They make garbage and sell 10 mil. what's the reason to try harder?
[2:10:10] eyelashTV: they don’t have to. they max sales with awful games so why invest more.
[2:10:12] JansonLives: I'm glad I'm too old for Pokemon.
[2:10:18] YdenTV: Dude play the Galactic Rock Man game. I'm blasting these fuckin aliens like Will Smith.
[2:10:20] DreadfuryDK: Legends Arceus was a straight-up banger, if a flawed one.
[2:10:20] Benjg7: isn’t it pretty established that the games are just coasting
[2:10:24] Wheva: After Nintendo forces massive turnover within gamefreak
[2:10:24] NaBNez: yep its the same thing every time just with different region
[2:10:27] thorcath: why make good game when bad game make money?
[2:10:28] AnarchyMoose: legends arceus was good but scarlet and violet are terrible
[2:10:28] JackOfAllApocalypses: @JansonLives same
[2:10:28] zannuss: I remember when it came out and I walked my ass over to toys r us to buy it the week it released

[2:10:30] Uniq_Choax: hopefully  the next one, as always prayge
[2:10:30] Smasher225: @RaiNeRpm last two gens have sold over 25 mil each
[2:10:32] spivet: they would have to stop releasing them yearly, but they cant because of all the other moving pieces of the franchise
[2:10:33] JohnAllenCasts: Nintendo have only ever innovated in the Mario universe
[2:10:33] smolderdaddyuwu: what about yugioh? @Maximum
[2:10:35] IamBadSry: Why bother? Reskin with bare min effort. Print money. Repeat
[2:10:50] SlowboLaggins: i dont think ive liked a pokemon game since like heartgold
[2:11:01] honeychonker: They dont make it better though, it hasnt been good since BW or XY
[2:11:05] gloop1: Balatro GOTY
[2:11:07] KaisenSiru: Theyre taking another year for LEgends ZA, so maybe that will give them the dev time than the yearly release
[2:11:08] OG_Kawngi: it's the largest media franchise, they've got no excuse to put such little effort in
[2:11:10] Consor: There have been zero good pokemon games on the switch, but the DS/3DS pokemon games are the best
[2:11:14] kallisz: i dont even get the nostalgia anymore, i want to have a rival that i hate and feels strong not these pushover. "Ohh wow you are really good, i hope to be you one day hey buddy ol' pal. toodaloo friend

[2:11:48] leubinator: fuck gary
[2:11:55] Smasher225: arceus was good but I want to see what happens with the next one
[2:11:57] skluer: gary was the goat
[2:11:58] Faraday5001: maximumGary
[2:11:59] menacingtrees: pokemon games are about the online pvp
[2:12:05] Jazzarus_: and they use to pick the stronger pokemon, when did they change that? lmao
[2:12:05] Slapsstick: wait did they switch it HUH gary claps cheeks with the counter pick
[2:12:06] RenegadeHeals: werent rivals supposed to have the better typing?
[2:12:06] Rootballa: that was actually nice in gen 9, the rival (Nemona) is already an experienced trainer who wants you to learn
[2:12:07] demepunkk: that's why Kaizo has been created LUL
[2:12:08] bleepbloopiee: gary was tough
[2:12:10] OG_Kawngi: give me a toggle that says i'm not a baby
[2:12:13] Ocenus: I think that they need to have nuzlockes built into the game as a difficulty option\
[2:12:13] tomlogon: its unbelievable theres not difficulty options
[2:12:19] smolderdaddyuwu: make babies great again
[2:12:20] spivet: @menacingtrees in the same way that wow is lmao
[2:12:23] honeychonker: weve been asking for a difficulty slider for years
[2:12:28] DanteDemonZ: id rather all pokemon gym and elite four matches be set to level 50 and your stats and moves actually matter as opposed to just overlevelling
[2:12:28] Xandid: ey haveth
[2:12:30] JansonLives: FromSoft should make the next Pokemon game.
[2:12:31] Xandid: they*

[2:12:37] NaBNez: hardcore pokemon
[2:12:40] Bryyo: that’s why people make games like emerald kiazo. shits so hard
[2:12:41] DanteDemonZ: @JansonLives based
[2:12:41] othernewname: Pokemon meets Eden ring
[2:12:44] Ocenus: it's possible with the difficulty fan made games
[2:12:44] demepunkk: Kaizo is essentially hard mode
[2:12:45] DreadfuryDK: Black and White 2 already made a hard mode. It wasn't even remotely close to Nuzlocke rules, but it buffed the shit out of a lot of trainer battles.
[2:12:48] menacingtrees: pokemon pvp is one of best games ever made
[2:12:56] Slapsstick: my buddy and i went hard on platinum nuzlockes
[2:12:57] spivet: didn they do that in black and white 2 which was the worst selling game in the franchise?
[2:12:58] Everok: There's romhacks with difficulty everywhere
[2:12:58] tomlogon: you dont even need to change the game, only numbers
[2:13:01] Varthar: Nintendo doesn’t care about any of that, they just want to sell games to kids
[2:13:02] DreadfuryDK: We're talking competitive items/movesets
[2:13:05] Your__Neighbour: Every normal trainer encounter is cynthia monkaW
[2:13:29] kiriuped: nobody gives THAT much of a shit to do rom hacks
[2:13:31] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:13:31] OG_Kawngi: KEKW
[2:13:36] Varthar: KEKW
[2:13:36] Rhop: They wouldn't do the "Pokemon faints it's dead" thing because killing Pokemon would be a no-no for their kids game.
[2:13:37] Ocenus: I mean yeahh their target audience is for children but their actual audience is people our age
[2:13:39] smolderdaddyuwu: LOL
[2:13:41] DanteDemonZ: nintendo just shut down yuzu emulator today

[2:13:51] OG_Kawngi: smash netcode Aware
[2:13:56] DanteDemonZ: @theDirtyon3 cant blame them
[2:13:56] JohnAllenCasts: Nintendo really don't like that their games are played in any way as esports
[2:13:57] kallisz: smash are the best games nintendo made and it was all an accident
[2:13:57] ARoomKey: @Maximum what do i tell my barber to get the maximum haircut
[2:13:57] DreadfuryDK: Coming from someone who used to be very involved with the Smash community, it's not all unwarranted. You remember what happened back in 2021?
[2:14:02] spivet: @Ocenus I think there is a good chance this is less true than you think it is. little kids fuckign LOVE pokemon
[2:14:07] Pyrrha_GG: Nintendo actively fucks over the Its game communities it’s crazy
[2:14:16] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:14:19] Aqinog: I don't think I've ever seen Max in stormwind LUL
[2:14:21] Swyvle: CRT tvs are so goated for fighting and platforming games
[2:14:26] FayaBaby: melee based
[2:14:27] destrominater: they should make a real life mode in Pokémon. things like other trainers you see daily ask to borrow money, your Pokémon gets in a rut and doesn’t want to train, your avatar goes into debt training Pokémon
[2:14:28] JansonLives: it was always funny watching them lug those things around at tournaments.
[2:14:35] Lrauq: luggin around CRTs
[2:14:38] tomlogon: Smash players 🤝 Wow players
[2:14:40] Idayn: what is that white city, wtf
[2:14:43] gloop1: @destrominater lmao

[2:15:06] leubinator: make me look like i talk about craftbeer
[2:15:07] smolderdaddyuwu: it takes more school to be a barber than a cop...
[2:15:09] kallisz: you just say do your thing? americans go crazy
[2:15:10] panser_nes: step 1: have hair
[2:15:14] Dacoolface: the ol "whatever you think looks good" cut

[2:15:45] nathkin: I thought i was hearing something outside my window
[2:15:45] OG_Kawngi: ride that cock bud
[2:15:49] JohnAllenCasts: Nintendo are just historically very against top level competetive structures. Like they're fine with small community tournaments and stuff but they just really don't want esports to have a place in their games.
[2:15:49] theskot: its sick
[2:15:53] theDirtyon3: Peacocks dont fly Susge

[2:16:30] OG_Kawngi: wha
[2:16:32] AnarchyMoose: not on the store Madge
[2:16:34] zannuss: they are more mad about the monthly reward being a pet
[2:16:34] kallisz: @bpguns xdd
[2:16:38] theskot: trading post giving me free stuff is cool
[2:16:40] theskot: i like it

[2:16:41] 324bee21: you don’t even have to do much I randomly get it done in like a day
[2:16:41] DreadfuryDK: This is unironically one of the most unique mounts they've ever released.
[2:16:45] KaisenSiru: And it should be able to dynamic fly too when War Within prepatch hits
[2:16:47] chubbytheboi: You know what's not sick. The monthly reward xD
[2:16:52] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:16:52] nemziac: why do people play this game if it makes them so mad

[2:17:58] spivet: the bigger weirdos are the people on /r/wow who do that and haven't played the game since wrath
[2:18:01] domz_i: Venruki's youtube is all clickbait
[2:18:01] ZealotryTV: the whole pvp community
[2:18:03] Aqinog: It was better before RAGEY
[2:18:06] NaiFatzaDePix: what addon pack you use?
[2:18:07] smolderdaddyuwu: I can
[2:18:07] JohnAllenCasts: how long before it's only the mentally boomed complaining about aug?
[2:18:08] ctg_dreamz: Reminds me of the people freaking out on Mr. GM for drinking a Starbucks coffee and not knowing their connection to the Palestine conflict
[2:18:09] bigpapapumpdaddy: you roast the ones you live
[2:18:11] ashepool: I play game when fun, not play when not fun. Is okay
[2:18:12] Blut103: idk league players do the same

[2:18:20] fatlittlepaypig: imo
[2:18:22] kingpeace09: the ladder
[2:18:22] Slapsstick: definitely thje second
[2:18:22] Everok: Second
[2:18:23] chubbytheboi: The second one
[2:18:24] othernewname: The latter
[2:18:25] Survain: bro if you walk away to shit before finding a dungeon group the game is bad and its the devs fault.
[2:18:25] Jumanjiqt: having "moved on"
[2:18:25] Wheva: second
[2:18:25] Lindorn_: 2nd one worse
[2:18:27] ChrisSalvii: moving on and complaining is way worse
[2:18:27] iamstrime: 2nd
[2:18:30] ChrisSalvii: waaaaay worse
[2:18:31] zerossussy: 2nd
[2:18:31] chubbytheboi: Just play the game and hate it
[2:18:31] kallisz: either way if you cant let go its real bad
[2:18:34] Uniq_Choax: 2nd for sure
[2:18:34] adardrae: i had friends that used to say they were addicted to wow and wish they could quit and hate themselves when they played
[2:18:37] HarmlessCurse: the second one is a large portion of the wow subreddit
[2:18:39] mabihiro: i love wow but playing the same 8 dungeons for over 6 months is killing it for me after a few weeks
[2:18:39] OG_Kawngi: it's an ex that you had a messy break up with
[2:18:40] nellfin: complaining while playing might get som problems solved tho
[2:18:52] aLLkiss: TOMRUS catching strays
[2:18:56] othernewname: Every game is like that, lol, cs2 etc
[2:19:03] Ukahen: moving on is worse
[2:19:10] theDirtyon3: PepeLaugh
[2:19:10] Ukahen: lying to yourself everyday
[2:19:11] lumaday: yes plz
[2:19:23] HarmlessCurse: @theDirtyon3 I 100%'d Elden RIng instead of therapy, that's close enough
[2:19:24] Uniq_Choax: Like classic players shitting on retail and vice versa
[2:19:29] kallisz: if you cant let go you need to work on it, simple as that imo
[2:19:31] JohnAllenCasts: I think there's an exception for people who would really like to get back into it and follow it's development but just don't think they'd enjoy it's current state. Depends how every day they go at it though
[2:19:34] theDirtyon3: @HarmlessCurse KEKW
[2:19:41] OG_Kawngi: 60% the size of base game
[2:19:43] fatlittlepaypig: they said about the size of limgrave
[2:19:44] panser_nes: a fucking ton
[2:19:46] Gizpachi: 10+ bosses
[2:19:46] Blut103: its pretty big
[2:19:47] yuhhhhe: as big as the starting area
[2:19:49] vigilantknives: 10 bosses at least
[2:19:50] kallisz: they said 30 hours and they called main game 50
[2:19:50] nemziac: usually its a lot
[2:19:56] Slapsstick: DS3 dlc was a banger, i have a faith
[2:19:57] trentbail23: do a dungeon or something
[2:19:57] Stinnkey: tHEY SAID THERE WILL BE 10 MAIN BOSSES
[2:19:58] Pyrrha_GG: it’s 40 bucks
[2:20:02] nemziac: main game 50
[2:20:03] honeychonker: Apart from a brief foray into FFXIV during Korthia, WoW has been my life for 17 years, it's only now i'm discovering other games like Palworld, Nightingale and No Mans sky
[2:20:03] Luvekh: They added 8 new weapon classes suppposedly
[2:20:03] nemziac: lmao
[2:20:05] theskot: 10 bosses? hmm
[2:20:07] fatlittlepaypig: i think that includes weeping peninsula as well
[2:20:10] panser_nes: 10man bosses?
[2:20:18] kiriuped: 12~?
[2:20:26] kiriuped: maybe 15
[2:20:28] Luvekh: Radahn
[2:20:28] fatlittlepaypig: radahn
[2:20:28] ctg_dreamz: Apparently the DLC is all GRRM creation lore wise
[2:20:29] Slapsstick: new weapons seem sick as fuck
[2:20:29] kiriuped: ish
[2:20:29] tanikins: Miyazaki said 7-8 hours, but general public is thinking 15-20 hours for the DLC
[2:20:30] Stinnkey: The main game had like 15 i think?
[2:20:31] Slapsstick: radhan
[2:20:31] Pyrrha_GG: 165 total base
[2:20:33] Blut103: radahn is a beast
[2:20:33] BigCizzle: radahn
[2:20:33] kallisz: 15 rememberance bosses so i guess its those

[2:22:29] fatlittlepaypig: big agree
[2:22:36] fatlittlepaypig: shorts+comfy shirt is bis
[2:22:50] thecajuncommie: an absolute lord underneath
[2:23:18] kallisz: from software dlcs always harder and always the best part of the game, expectations are high
[2:23:20] fatlittlepaypig: i have to beat malenia still, i beat everything else
[2:23:29] fatlittlepaypig: just got burned out
[2:23:33] Basic_3: 5 phase sister friede
[2:23:36] spivet: dlc for the souls games usually have super hard bosses
[2:23:38] Survain: truthhhh
[2:23:38] kallisz: melania though is top tier difficulty of from software shit7
[2:23:49] Stinnkey: Yeah but if theres one thing we know forsure, Fromsoft DLC always SLAPS
[2:23:50] Diazanite: if messmer doesnt fuck me sideways running up a set of stairs with a pair of cactus spine infused salted lemons im going to refund that dlc
[2:23:57] fatlittlepaypig: i like how they made it so you can make the game as difficult as you want it to be
[2:24:01] pheezr_: just finished elden ring last night, took me 7hrs to kill Melenia
[2:24:05] DreadfuryDK: Most Souls bosses punish you for panic rolling. Elden Ring bosses punish you for panic rolling by scaring you into panic rolling another three times afterwards and punishing the fourth roll.
[2:24:08] Basic_3: Kind of odd Elden Ring doesn't have a Story difficulty
[2:24:11] Morayeden: HUH get in where
[2:24:12] vigilantknives: well malenia was never needed to beat the game
[2:24:12] kallisz: first half of elden ring was not that great imo
[2:24:18] OG_Kawngi: @Basic_3 this is the least odd thing
[2:24:26] fatlittlepaypig: using summons my first playthrough as melee and then not using them the next time was really enjoyable
[2:24:28] cannibalcanyon: yep
[2:24:34] BigLarryWithThaGarry: It can't be that hard the shareholders have to beat it before it can be released
[2:24:37] Blut103: mimic tear on release KEKL
[2:24:41] DanteDemonZ: using magic, summons and mimic tier is easy mode for sure
[2:24:46] Pyrrha_GG: it’s called over level everything
[2:24:47] bookbag_: i played with summons and magic but i only had 10 vigor so if i got touched i died
[2:24:48] cannibalcanyon: mimic tear was so broken LUL
[2:24:52] Diazanite: the story mode is summoning the scarlet rot upon everything beholden to the lands between
[2:24:57] Slapsstick: first playthrough was no summons, felt soooo good after
[2:25:00] daevyfan: playing on locked 60 fps is already hardmode
[2:25:02] ArcaneSyntax: I can wait for more elden ring tiktok compilations with attack on titan music
[2:25:02] MagmaScythe: Story difficulty in the game that tells it through  item descriptions?
[2:25:11] kallisz: play those games the way you want man, no lvl are the real homies though
[2:25:12] Exergy044: bleed builds were the story difficulty lol
[2:25:30] chubbytheboi: I figured it out. I just press Play in Steam and play it
[2:25:36] maxam_1: i downloaded this after seeing you play it, unbelievably addictive
[2:26:02] kallisz: @Exergy044 launch double jump attack spears were about the same, mana physique beam so many things to exploit
[2:26:07] Diazanite: ok does helldivers 2 bang solo or is it only really good with the boys
[2:26:07] kiriuped: are you buttering the dune bucket?
