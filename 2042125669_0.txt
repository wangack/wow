[0:40:41] xiimiixd: Question, if my BenQ 29 inch screen is slow to start up, during start up (no signal for the first 30 sec of startup), that means my screen is on it's last legs right? Dunno anything about screens, but had it for 5 years now.
[0:40:48] dekelsrightnutt: cool
[0:40:49] eu_kev: Pojke on the verge of selling the Doomhammer behind him BibleThump  please watch ads boys

[0:44:43] xiimiixd: MoP <3
[0:44:43] whiskeyprobe: as long as mop comes i dont care for the rest
[0:44:59] rayzerpls: I think mop meta in classic will be good, each season changes the meta
[0:45:02] rayzerpls: not like wrath
[0:45:03] andreis7r1k3: I'm down for legion pog
[0:45:05] rayzerpls: if im not mistaken

[0:46:37] xiimiixd: When is your Queen kill today?
[0:46:39] vitpro: for sure
[0:46:45] Aspmann: They need to put every quality of life thing in classic and keep the gameplay the same
[0:46:55] xiimiixd: ok perfect
[0:47:09] dekelsrightnutt: @andreis7r1k3 tbh i wouldnt mind a full set. bc then i would know that wrath would come out again x3

[1:22:47] apacheD: @zoegoTV I hate that shit. Either it is right or it is wrong LUL
[1:22:56] zoegoTV: im in no position to agree or disagree kekw
[1:22:57] Nab1337: well telling, maybe the best paladin in the game, which spells to press is a bit too much xD

[1:24:36] burningtruths: I feel they were talking about different things; pojke was talkiing about lining the flash and shinta was saying that flash into shock was a loss of healing because you keep your shock off CD for an extra global
[1:24:59] NurfMe206: the shock was on CD when he died tho
[1:25:03] aleyn: Whats your plan for Cata Classic? what will you play 2s 3s ?

[1:46:59] snorkkisss: @rupturekd u guys can be so cocky 😁
[1:47:04] apacheD: The thing is just that you maybe made a mistake, but that is not why he died, he died from his mistake which was major.
[1:47:04] Luelik0: How can you use 1 bad Global in a long Game? :7 How can you do that?
[1:47:06] Biggun_33: Im with you say i missed the global you lined 3 heals and died ????
[1:47:06] snorkkisss: Not all ofc
[1:47:11] certylb: lolxscriptx: i dont want to be rude to pojke cuz i already played with him but he cant see the situation from top hpal side like brunity or choko the boys are in milions year ahead of him @Minpojke you played with this guy?
[1:47:29] certylb: hes trashing you on shinta's twitch
[1:47:31] certylb: what a prick
[1:47:37] Zero_Kelvin: His argument is, since he didn't receive healing in perfect globals, he thought the only way to live is to line
[1:47:39] shucoco: His missplay is game losing no matter how you look at it. But probably he felt like he had to line some dmg cause he was pretty low
[1:47:47] RuptureKD: @snorkkisss But we're not ! We looks like but we just want to be right
