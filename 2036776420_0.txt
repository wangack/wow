[1:35:47] bollskis: u let the grinds soak overnight basically
[1:35:48] alexphet: put your coffee in the fridge
[1:35:50] timmah25: you soak the grounds in the fridge then strain it
[1:35:50] libnip: Get a $80 ninja from Best Buy and it has a cold brew setting for grounds. Done.

[1:36:19] libnip: Caffeine is a volatile molecule so it boils off quicker
[1:36:22] Bignog246: @pikabooirl because it sits in the grounds for way longer soaking in more vs blasting hot water through it faster
[1:36:23] gio_jitsu_: Its easy
[1:36:24] Ryso33: for real
[1:36:24] libnip: Science bro
[1:36:25] garzzyy: Look up STOK cold brew, its at any groceries comes in a gallon or so

[1:36:29] betterbeup: Or you could just get 500 caffeine pills for $10 off amazon, lasts a year.
[1:36:38] Ifwuzzy: just make a bunch and leave in fridge ready
[1:36:45] fluatonin: people drink cold brew faster mainly, also the least amount of roasting the beans get the more caffeine, blonde roasts etc
[1:36:48] volxine: @garzzyy can confirm stok is goated
[1:36:54] libnip: Just like booze. It breaks down quicker than boiling water so you lose that caffeine
[1:37:03] JerBoody: cause you brew it in the fridge for like 24 hours so it extracts more caffeine than just running hot water over it for a few minutes
[1:37:05] libnip: Little knowledge for yall
[1:37:10] danger_daft: LMFAOOO
