[0:38:55] Lanoom1: @Clapfish Offline and Online characters are seperate. So Offline will work just fine for pure play, but it's seperate progression.
[0:39:06] Grid1010: @Clapfish you can't switch between offline and online, an offline character is stuck in offline and vice versa

[0:50:28] VinegarBob: @KrisMenace I agree with you on principle, but that ruined PoE for me. The game is balanced around trading, so if you don't trade it becomes intolerably grindy (for me at least). I'm hoping the Last Epoch devs have found a neat way around this balancing issue

[1:13:02] briantouch: one question folks.. Dan got this map in the centre of the screen i assume there option to change this from the top right i got mine set it seems?
[1:13:08] TheHanbill: @BloodShotTell MLAISE yw
[1:13:15] AlexTheBoldTV: glacier is awesome here
[1:13:27] Lanoom1: @briantouch The defauly keybind is Tab to switch
[1:13:31] Lanoom1: default*
[1:13:53] briantouch: thanks again pardon the questions
[1:14:08] Lanoom1: @briantouch No problem, we love genuien questions cuppLove
[1:14:08] thereisacow: Yeah me too I only look at the map not the graphics LUL
[1:14:14] Darkomax: did he restart?
[1:14:17] jakozzy: arc Kappa
[1:14:18] KatzAye: what does this game have that differentiates it from Diablo or PoE?
[1:14:29] roy_o_: I kinda understand why D4 doesn't have that overlay map, but it is so useful
[1:14:34] gamerchris901: is this game on steam?
[1:14:38] TheChristopherG: glacier is Pog
[1:14:42] Lanoom1: @Darkomax Switched to full offline since the sevrers are still having major zone transition issues
[1:14:48] Lanoom1: @gamerchris901 Yep :)
[1:14:50] magenof: are the servers working or is dan offline mode?
[1:14:56] PervySages: chat, when buying a computer, any tips for what to look for to run games? I bought one a few years ago, although i couldn't play New World because it didn't have the proper graphics card. . . i think? Not sure any tips?
[1:15:02] Riverdusk: @KatzAye it is in between them in complexity, which is a sweet spot for a lot of people
[1:15:09] Lanoom1: They've said it's not capacity. It's modules used for loading zones. cuppSip
[1:15:13] shilohx44k: Is there cooperative play in this game?
[1:15:16] thereisacow: The matchmaking system on the servers. Capacities are not the problem but the code for creating new instances, Dan
[1:15:18] Lanoom1: So yeah, they need to get that sorted
[1:15:31] KatzAye: @Riverdusk gotcha, thanks
[1:15:31] NullProperty: servers are fine, its the matchmaking service app that keeps failing under load. they have said they have fixes planned for today to hopefully address what's been happening. I guess we'll see.
[1:15:55] RushingHook: LE-61 danRage
[1:15:59] thereisacow: Fix soon danCopium
[1:16:16] Ndorfens: @shilohx44k 4 person party

[1:16:27] Lanoom1: cuppSip LE's already hit another CCU peak today at 190k, I beleive
[1:16:39] NullProperty: Yeah. I figure if its not working well this evening then I'll bit the bullet and play offline for the weekend
[1:16:39] ItsJustDat1Guy: @PervySages check your needed vram for the gpu. 12gb should be a decent minimum from now on. 32 gb or ram. oh make sure you take the plastic off before you start the pc lol
[1:16:45] thereisacow: @janaparks The game is very fun especially when your build gets better
[1:16:47] Riverdusk: can only chat with us
[1:16:54] Lanoom1: @janaparks Yes :) If you're in the mood for a ARPG in bwteene Diablo's accessibility and PoE's complexity, this is a good one.
[1:16:56] kimba274: @janaparks if you like arpg then yes
[1:16:57] janaparks: @thereisacow i like diablo so maybe i should try

[1:17:59] Riverdusk: @darkrose009 Steam popup option when you first start game
[1:17:59] RushingHook: @darkrose009 I believe in the Steam setting for the game, before you load in to the actual game?
[1:18:00] Mochitas2: i was watching Cohh and he was offline and chatting in the in game chat

[1:20:06] roy_o_: Are the characters shared? between full offline and online/offline chars?
[1:20:10] Lanoom1: cuppSip LE devs have just wteeted that they have multiple updates planned for today to try to address the issues. Wishing them the best.
[1:20:12] NullProperty: you can switch between both offline modes any time you want. so if you'd like chat its "safe" to play in that modfe and if you run into trouble you can relog that character into full offline
[1:20:24] roy_o_: Ah that was my question! thanks @DansGaming
[1:20:30] moxxzor: launch steam in offline mode, launch last epoch in offline mode, use your offline character, disable your wifi, disconnect the router, destroy your modem, cancel your ISP danClueless then you can play in TRUE offline mode
[1:20:37] madmatt0014: @thereisacow haha LUL

[1:21:10] meh_ninja_please: tbh you dont wanna see chat
[1:21:20] Lanoom1: cuppSip Probably because the social infrastructure and network/multiplayer infrastructure are handled differently.

[1:21:25] thereisacow: Chat iss arguing over D4 like 50 % of the time
[1:21:28] Gat0rCh0mp: K?
[1:21:29] NullProperty: the matchmaking app issues don't have to dow ith chat functionality, so the chat enabled offline shouldnt be an issue

[1:36:00] thereisacow: @KrisMenace it's not so hard to understand once you tried it a couple of times but some resources for your build can be pretty rare and not be available
[1:36:01] Lanoom1: @Lanoom1 Not sure if there are any existing ARPGs that do WASD, but Path of Exile 1, Diablo 4, and Last Epoch have controller options to various "fullness" degrees.
[1:36:03] Jane_Denton: @meh_ninja_please Aware geeezus that sounds unnatural and painful

[1:37:39] wwonka961: @johnnysasaki she's a lyrical genius danDespair
[1:37:45] Lanoom1: @thereisacow the tl;dr is that every equipment has 4 slots for basic affixes (2 prefix, 2 suffix) and the Forge allows you to put in the affixes you want, or upgrade existing ones, with the crafting shards you'll find as drops or get by shattering exisitng items.
[1:37:46] Riverdusk: @Lanoom1 Victor Vran has wasd movement, only one I can think of, and more niche of a game in the genre
[1:37:58] thereisacow: KrisMenace You want to look for a good base items with affixes you need you can exchange unwanted ones into a new random but basically it is just buffing the affixes
[1:38:02] levellimiter: does anyone know how he became the last epoch cohzCS
[1:38:07] Lanoom1: @Riverdusk Oh yes, that's right. COmpeltely forgot Vran.
[1:38:16] Jane_Denton: @TheSolree danGasp asssss gas is made of methane and hydrogen.. they are flamable gasses you don't want that in your blood stream... if you don't burp or fart you get bloat which is painful
