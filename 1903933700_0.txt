[0:14:58] Zel_Storm: where do I obtain reward that I purchased for points?
[0:15:10] GMAcele: I wonder what comp they'll be using for the actual matches after this -- because the nerfs will be live and so will the ones to 20 and higher keys
[0:15:22] Kiddsforever: kiddsfSeb i have tacos and tea..i am ready for this lol
[0:15:24] Bearman999: main choke points would be the scripted bosses you can't speed up.  Bar, Arena, a few others
[0:15:30] Treypanning: @noah102102 today doesn't have the scaling nerfs iirc, so probably no
[0:15:33] GMAcele: lets hope the actual matches later will have diverse comps instead of the static one we've seen for the past several weeks

[0:37:52] nitt5: why all classes the same haha wheres the diversity
[0:37:54] tassadartimon: Erm not that anything but The international exists so the argument about price pools is slightly MonkaS
[0:37:55] roca_tm: Meers position on fisrt pull
[0:38:00] radixtree: oh nice, with 4 teams we'll have all of them on screen at all times

[0:38:07] Feinton: @zennluffy the price pool isn´t insane but the sponserships are high

[0:38:32] CallMeTOG: You guys misheard him. He said the largest prize pool in an esports league that is occurring "today" Kappa
[0:38:37] radixtree: @atrame the question is if they'll get that 2% extra dmg on last boss
[0:38:45] Kwepp: difference is they get paid a salary during season and then also get a prize at the end
[0:38:47] Rwto21: @atrame yep... or just exploit something to win
[0:39:00] dwolfking: starcraft prize pool was 400k
[0:39:25] Throdawn: all these echo fanboys here :D
[0:39:33] Tarosath: dota 2 prizes :D
[0:39:40] atrame: @radixtree well yesterday, they had 3 deaths, and it phased with 2% left, they can't do it without something insane at the start
[0:39:42] realies__: weeks of playing and wasting time just to give another virtual trophy to echo zzz next season pls already

[0:42:40] imexalted1: @mysterious_guy it's always the same comp, theres always going to be a meta comp
[0:42:48] aewen22: @Matkingo03 cata*
[0:42:49] CptAshman: @RayFinkle1 Yep
[0:43:02] jezeabell: Hehehe
[0:43:04] pezinafm: @ooWithKittens u telling me we didnt see alore more specs last season MDI

[0:43:06] mksmoke55: @Matkingo03 delusional :D
[0:43:08] realies__: @ooWithKittens usually there are 7-8 specs at the top, now its just 5
[0:43:20] Matkingo03: @aewen22 uldaman is a classic dungeon
[0:43:24] SMOrc0: Click living on the edge
[0:43:38] DaBo00: @pezinafm almost like MDI and TGP need different comps
[0:43:48] justAxli: what that WR by echo VP means? :D

[0:44:00] imexalted1: @mysterious_guy usually? TGP has always been  the same comps outside of echos double tank strat
[0:44:05] pezinafm: @DaBo00 talking about more options not which, nice strawman
[0:44:07] Treypanning: @Matkingo03 have a look at the run and see if its the same dungeon
[0:44:09] phansk: @AxliSenpai World record
[0:44:17] badassito_gg: What's the affix for uldaman?

[0:44:26] aenoswe: @AxliSenpai World Record, highest so far yet.
[0:44:36] imexalted1: @pezinafm MDI and TGP are not the same lol
[0:44:38] white0wl: @badassito_gg tyranical entang and bursting

[0:44:49] pezinafm: @Sleepypan if you dont see how much worse this season is compared to last you clearly dont play the game
[0:44:53] Matkingo03: @frrrogstone yeah buddyyyyyy lets see if it is
[0:44:54] VinMDz: Its hard getting keys done now when not on the meta classes, and running keys without Aug and Priest just feels rough tbh
[0:44:56] DaBo00: @pezinafm almost like TGP and MDI require different things from the comp they're playing. If this was an MDI we'd see more varied comps
[0:45:10] pezinafm: world of 5 classes :)
[0:45:12] nitt5: is this the awc lads
[0:45:25] aenoswe: @DaBo00 Ofc, this is how high you can get, the MDI is how fast you do it.
[0:45:30] heyitsferris: @nitt5 Close! This is TGP.
[0:45:35] Matkingo03: Are they not allowed to play Warriors?
[0:45:39] imexalted1: @pezinafm probably a rogue main huh?

[0:45:57] moderatygos: @Sebleh ragefire chasm
[0:45:57] desjy: imagine having to choose a different class every weekend
[0:45:59] CptAshman: @pezinafm We wouldnt though, they would still chose the meta comp at the timwe
[0:46:06] Throdawn: there were prot warriors
[0:46:08] shmmeker: whos this caster speaking
[0:46:16] CptAshman: @shmmeker Tetles and Meeix
[0:46:16] Lowon: 8:19 for NA

[1:08:40] diskmachin1: OSFrog
[1:08:41] blinkeys: why is the NA fire mage not press thje callterize ?
[1:08:44] Radsol54: Echo looking really good right now with that 29 already on the board, zooming through this 30. They are tough to beat today man
[1:08:47] Moelleux_Tartiflette: Despairge
[1:08:50] SylvaticSky1755: its getting to the boss is the annoying part lol
[1:08:51] OGkush710: I mean good news is perplexed had to restart twice lol

[1:09:07] mksmoke55: @Throdawn gained free knoledge
[1:09:08] Sebleh: NA's Last Hope should have taken a third DPS instead of a second healer if they wanted to time it.
[1:09:17] jezeabell: Hello
[1:09:17] torkim1351: so why didnt NA's key drop back to 28?
[1:09:18] Radsol54: Doesnt matter what perplexed is doing any more if you are trying to win today
[1:09:22] NUMYUMMY12: those 30 minutes were not a waste as long as they had fun
[1:09:23] cheeky88: so much knowledge
[1:09:29] morZaw: @torkim1351 tournament realm
[1:09:29] Radsol54: unless u just want 3rd for a little more $$
[1:09:31] moderatygos: @torkim1351 they can reset keys and deplete without it lowering
[1:09:33] jezeabell: How twitter is operating ?
[1:09:35] HunterT14: Poly that’s why you aren’t a world first with such a statement
[1:09:36] SylvaticSky1755: @Megadisaster24 tyran, entangling and bolstering i think

[1:10:18] morZaw: @moderatygos what affixes is it in uldaman? looks like the dungeon for today is uldaman atleast
[1:10:19] Throdawn: Perplexed seems to not find into it again.....
[1:10:21] flouflis: time wasn't an issue, it was the 4th phase on last boss
[1:10:25] onion_warrior: 🇪🇺
[1:10:26] Radsol54: Echo as a raiding team and m+ win for the same reason, they can keep focused for long attrition periods of time
[1:10:27] fashion_derg: @moderatygos think that should be a thing on live as well? it could help I think, like, you didnt time it at first, made some big mistake, you could reset and try again instead of going down
[1:10:31] Throdawn: maybe they should do ULD ...
[1:10:31] moderatygos: !dungeon
[1:10:34] dragoon2k: I think no matter what the key is to not get the 3rd intermission on final boss if they beat that they win if they miss they lose

[1:14:07] hiddjes: @olliewombat Aug buffs all the other teammates

[1:15:19] slisper: dwarf sims highest for fire
[1:15:20] bebincalicious: @Fallenarch11 yes, but aren't they cheesing it anyway
[1:15:26] Throdawn: NA also having issues here...
[1:15:30] HalberdWesker: They practiced as well though!
[1:15:39] kvnzi_: @quarkoffel uldaman, tyran bursting entangling
[1:15:46] sonic_gravity: somebody tell the casters NA wiped
[1:15:54] logarthz1: @slisper or its because of bleed removal
[1:15:54] Throdawn: @quarkoffel ULD Bursting and entangling
[1:15:56] moltencrucible: @Radsol54 both na last hope and perplexed demonstrated that they can time VP 29, it all comes down to execution, but they are definitely good enough to do it
[1:15:59] quarkoffel: @kvnzi_ yikes. Thanks!
[1:16:07] Tapes__: @bebincalicious removes rushing magic dot from the initial trash, also phys dr for the later trash aoes. It's the default pick anyway
[1:16:10] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports

[1:16:33] sayezz93: u guys think WoW will die anytime? or will they do endless addons or WoW2 in a few years?
[1:16:35] bebincalicious: @Tapes__ Cheers. Wasn't aware of the first pack.
[1:16:46] dragoon2k: @Radsol54 Don't think so, 29 VP all though its hard its more likely than going up one more in other dungeons
[1:16:48] jezeabell: So it yes and no ?
[1:16:50] Throdawn: is HOI 30 WR ?
[1:16:50] TomTomfoolery: !schedule
[1:16:50] Moobot: @TomTomfoolery AWC schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/arena#schedule | MDI schedule: https://blizz.ly/MDISchedule
[1:16:56] HeySpacecamp: Picking dwarves in order to successfully hide under the stairs
[1:16:59] Radsol54: @moltencrucible yeah but its lookin like it might take all day to do it, NA's last hope's, last run looks hard to replicate, and they still failed.
[1:17:13] Treypanning: @sayezz93 full support for another ten years at least, or until a generation of young players doesn't pick it up
[1:17:30] Radsol54: im basically just saying its really good for echo that they got one of their best iterations prolly, in an early run, puts them far ahead.
[1:17:30] Moobot: Learn more about The Great Push! https://blizz.ly/TGP2023
[1:17:39] clouders1: Echo's time compared to last time is kind of irrelevant. They missed killing the boss at 2% when the boss phased. So in order to time it they either need 2 minutes from the prior run or to kill the boss before the extra phase.
[1:17:41] SyriosOne: @Rogastik and were are they now, oh right they got eliminated in their group rounds LUL
[1:17:47] Chillcitysnipz: @sayezz93 die? No. Low player count for sure. I would assume we aint getting wow 2 anytime soon
[1:17:48] 생화차: Is the last dungeon uldaman?
[1:17:50] dragoon2k: @Radsol54 tbh Preplexed run was way faster until they wiped so its possible to speed it up quite abit
[1:17:58] quarkoffel: Wasn't it 44%?
[1:17:58] thorak90: @생화차 yes
[1:18:05] moltencrucible: @Radsol54 wiping after 30min of full focus and not making it for a few second can mental boom you pretty hard... might cost you the tournment for sure, just saying they can do it for sure, don't know if in a good amount of time
[1:18:08] helkona: 44
[1:18:17] sonic_gravity: they need to lust on pull so everyone gets it, then gingi gets the second lust
[1:18:18] Radsol54: @dragoon2k agreed on perplexed, but tbh, NA's last hope not so much
[1:18:25] bebincalicious: brb I'll try this pull on live Kappa
[1:18:29] Radsol54: @moltencrucible agree
[1:18:30] sayezz93: @frrrogstone idk how it seems with new players and something or actual players count
[1:18:33] Rogastik: @SyriosOne I was only typing that in response what tettles said where some teams randomly 1 shot hard keys, wasnt implying they are better
[1:18:35] aocAorus: Perplexed is struggling hard
[1:18:42] jezeabell: Hmm
[1:18:57] shmmeker: VP 29 is WALL
[1:18:59] Relyst: i heard thirteen
[1:19:00] mejren991: SHE DID SAY 13
[1:19:00] andrine42: @sayezz93 eh I doubt wow is gonna die anytime soon as most of the people who are still playing are more or less committed at this point and that isnt likely to change
[1:19:04] regulater45: April DinoDance DinoDance
[1:19:14] gnomie2k: She did say 13
[1:19:16] bigmac9324: she definitely said 13
[1:19:17] ggDoA: Basically any timed key outside of the early ULD ones today is huge
[1:19:25] swatfirex: jonasw5Gasm
[1:19:29] Sintry123: If they can't get that extra 2%, it doesn't matter if they pull it at 29:00 or 28:30. They NEED to get the extra 2% or the timers are all meaningless
[1:19:32] SA_guy: yip she said 13
[1:19:35] Throdawn: @aocAorus yes ;( After doing it soooo well before..
[1:19:38] Vladimorth: Wich patch they playing?
[1:19:43] Radsol54: @ggDoA 100%
[1:19:52] flouflis: @Sintry123 they don't seem to get it :D

[1:20:02] jezeabell: Have a good evening
[1:20:07] Emiliability: @Sintry123 sure but what they're saying if they pull the boss after 30 minutes, even if they make that 2% up they still deplete
[1:20:15] Treypanning: @sayezz93 there will be a bottom end of active membership that will start activision asking questions about how to wind it down
[1:20:23] GER_Mad: @Vladimorth 10.1.5
[1:20:31] bebincalicious: So, even if other teams time the same keys as Echo, they're behind on overall times, right?
[1:20:33] YENqtx: !casters

[1:46:08] Sleepypan: why are the teams running two healers? does pres evoker really bring that much to the comp?

[1:47:49] nervio2701: i think na's time is rip
[1:47:57] Feinton: @dratnos is it worth using BL at 20% so you maybe can ignore one more star with healer being able to outheal for longer?
[1:47:57] x_Scy: darawsha94 that's very basic trolling Susge i expected more

[2:21:12] Seb24285: @CritcakeEU I just can guess the Details numbers then
[2:21:13] Sleepypan: @Seb24285 u can get upto 1440 i thought but yeh twitch is pretty behind the times with video quality :P
[2:21:57] SultanGaming44: Imagine having an opinion of a dungeon lol
[2:21:59] MrLeijon: @Sleepypan its 2160 on youtube
[2:22:05] VVicher666: Oh it's nice to see the difference in party comps.
[2:22:05] RichardPPPan: comp this Joel meta that Joel im just a fisk Joel fisking in twitch chat Joel
[2:22:06] RagnarTheEverchosen: it was a ninja pull

[2:22:12] utopin: WTB 4k monitor
[2:22:14] mikkymisuko: @Xyronic NA Last hope changed their 2nd lust to trash instead of 2nd boss
[2:22:17] Kelthiz: @Seb24285 Ye just watch on youtube, it's a bit delayed but higher quality I think
[2:22:20] DadBodGamerGuy: Wow - these Evokers gotta learn how to DPS!  How in the world are they so bad!   Sub me in on my DPS Evoker!!!
[2:22:30] CritcakeEU: you can get 1440p on twitch yes, but the bitrate isn't really high enough to support it, so things will get blocky pretty fast when there's a lot of stuff moving on the screen
[2:22:31] Bloodbottler_88: @skyy187 Bold of you to assume I can even do a +8.
[2:22:37] lovelicious1: Why did you remove WR from echo and put it in perplexed , what matters is who does it first?

[2:23:20] Mulictz: @knicknack92 it's being MC'd

[3:07:28] jesma: The Uldaman run wasnt a WR?
[3:07:31] dragoon2k: why isnt Uldaman a WR? Since it was the first 29 completed in the dungeon
[3:07:33] oll3cko: it ends today by midnight or they play also tomorrow?
[3:07:42] z3popa: @oll3cko today
[3:07:42] DadItYourself: Wouldn’t echos uld be a wr?
[3:07:51] JeanZM_: @oll3cko ends today
[3:07:52] kargaz_classic: Dont Copy my Question :D :P
[3:07:53] Finaren_: 29uld was already done in trials
[3:07:54] spansonite1: i cant wait to see the announcers again like a football game with the transformer guy!
[3:08:02] Adishoneee: @thunderioum I think they can pick whatever gear they want on tournament realm
[3:08:02] phinez_: there was a 29 ulda done in one of the cups i think
[3:08:03] cheeky88: ends in 2.5 hours
[3:08:14] jNsftw: yeah done in cups
[3:08:21] lokiasterisk: @thunderioum some dungeons are only timable on 28 and some are timable on 30, its very hard to get the specific correct highest of each key since its a random drop
[3:08:26] PengoOoO: echo > all
[3:08:30] kargaz_classic: on the trails also 20 Tyranical?
[3:08:35] Snayderino: @Adishoneee really, so it's like ptr in a sense that all gear is available to them?
[3:08:35] Moobot: Check out the Raider.io highlights! https://raider.io/mdi

[3:08:41] kargaz_classic: 29*
[3:08:51] SoullessRose: Echo's 29 Uld missing WR tag?
[3:08:57] andrine42: The specific affix's are also different on the tournament realm than on live right? which obv affects if the key is even possible?
[3:08:57] Snayderino: @seishirouzz nice, i like that
[3:08:59] Finaren_: @shmmeker easy kekw
[3:09:03] moltencrucible: @shmmeker nah echo have way better timer on everything beside VP 29
[3:09:15] Vranan: @shmmeker they have worse timer everywhere execpt VP so not really
[3:09:16] theorycall: oh guys who u guess will win this tournement? i will no expect this winner im so hyped
[3:09:17] SylvaticSky1755: Perplexed defo faster than echo in Uladman
[3:09:20] Finaren_: @soullessrose mby bcs it is not
[3:09:29] Lmonaid: what addon / Wa is it for the m+ timer pack ?
[3:09:30] RichardPPPan: comp this Joel meta that Joel im just a fisk Joel fisking in twitch chat Joel
[3:09:38] pippana: i sure hope ashine shows that he truly is the greatest gamer in the world(of warcraft ofc..)
[3:09:43] Snayderino: @Thelegendsrv comes down to execution and not a gear gap, very fair imo
[3:09:51] Kserds: group C was more interesting than final)
[3:10:01] goonerboi21: im gonna start pulling the entire  trash of Uld into 1st boss, GL pugs
[3:10:05] Vranan: @SylvaticSky1755 3.18 with 5 boss tyra, we will see
[3:10:15] Snayderino: @Kserds group C was insane, the whole time that group was going was intense
[3:10:24] Bearman999: perp had a death
[3:10:37] torx10: 1m dps meeres
[3:10:40] Ladiplace: The fight between the last 3 for 2nd Position will be the highlight of the day.
[3:10:48] mattdj2002: So at this point it seems like if echo scores one more point it’s over.
[3:10:50] JeanZM_: In order to fight for the first place Perplexed have to time this 29 and then do the HOI 30 right?
[3:10:53] kargaz_classic: Echo has also one death in ULD 29
[3:11:08] Rogash95: @goonerboi21 if ppl can pull it off on +29, it should be easy in a +11 right? xD
[3:11:09] spansonite1: <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 warcaraft <3 <3 <3
[3:11:15] dragoon2k: @JeanZM_ and time or improve timers in some other dungeons
[3:11:16] kargaz_classic: yes @JeanZM_
[3:11:30] flouflis: chat what is the remaining time?
[3:11:32] brotan123: breathlessly calling a 28 while perplexed is just bing chilling the 29 lul
[3:11:34] Tapes__: @mattdj2002 pretty much, will take perplexed at least 1hr and a bit to equalise , 1 more point would be 1.5hrs
[3:11:37] cheeky88: bromach is the ultimate bro
[3:11:39] jesma: i wanna see Echo do 31 Freehold
[3:11:47] JeanZM_: @flouflis 2.5 hours
[3:11:59] theorycall: fight what guys. echo has like 5min less
[3:12:04] simoncs: @JeanZM_ They still wont be close to winning, Echo has huge time-leads on Perplexed either way.
[3:12:08] flouflis: @JeanZM_ thanks
[3:12:18] risam_1742: 31fh lesgo
[3:12:26] tettles: Wokege

[3:15:10] Gaphill: @jdubz26 and make even less teams bother
[3:15:12] Sarinilol: isn't 29 Uld not a WR? thought it was WF +29
[3:15:16] kargaz_classic: @Meeix at least you take it with Humor :P
[3:15:16] OverwatchFlame: plonk
[3:15:17] Adishoneee: @Meeix My wife suggest that it would be nice to have a green dot of live instance on the score table on the right also for someone without game knowledge
[3:15:18] alfu6aim: plink plonk  󠀀
[3:15:26] Meeix: @Adishoneee yeah i passed that on

[3:16:11] khandee: Rooting for NA Last Hope, but how can you not want to see Echo press these keys. So exciting to watch.
[3:16:16] lockdown_sypher1: @moderatygos logs ?
[3:16:21] moderatygos: @Thelegendsrv i don't believe they track damage, if the teams are using logs that might, but not sure
[3:16:24] winnem89: why does it not say WR on uld for echo?
[3:16:28] dragoon2k: the timer for Legendary on the dwarfs was wicked fast
[3:16:29] machonie: SHOW ECHO THEY ARE IN 31 FREEHOLD!!!!!!!!!!
[3:16:36] Lamageddon: SyriosOne like Monk Tank, Resto Shaman, Survival Hunter, Arms Warrior, sub Rogue? Kappa

[3:17:46] helafix696: yes
[3:17:48] machonie: all fine
[3:17:54] Snayderino: dood, this is gonna be insane if they can time it
[3:17:57] henkeboombate: defensive trinket time?
[3:18:03] goonerboi21: bring BDK for AMZ then u live no worries
[3:18:06] Fatassfrodo: can LoS the shout but not really good spots for it at the start pull
[3:18:09] XueAndDende: @dethbybunnies that's nothing new
[3:18:28] dethbybunnies: @dethbybunnies Jebaited

[3:18:55] Moobot: The Great Push Format Explainer: https://youtu.be/iSB2Oo5VIHE
[3:19:02] Tarosath: why don't echo outrange the shouts on spriest/mage?
[3:19:23] Tarosath: nvm :)
[3:19:24] Tapes__: The real tip is to play hunter and feign death the season
[3:19:27] wraaith: los and range the shouts its the only real play for it
[3:19:31] Fatassfrodo: Just LoS the shout either on the corner or by the building
[3:19:42] Sleepypan: @Tapes__ OUCH but true LUl
[3:19:42] GurkanEz: When does this end?
[3:19:51] gotelto: u guys are so smart
[3:20:10] moderatygos: @GurkanEz 2 hours 17 minutes to start a new dungeon
[3:20:18] Shearin77: SeemsGood
[3:20:24] flouflis: didn't Echo already timed 31 FH during trials on Tyrannical?
[3:20:29] XueAndDende: People giving tips in a dungeon that I did when it was current in BfA LUL
[3:20:31] chocomallows: @GurkanEz 2hr 15 min
[3:20:35] Nowatersry: @GurkanEz They can start the last run at 23:59 after that they cant start more. They can however finish the dungeon they started.
[3:20:45] Shearin77: @flouflis yes but that was with cannons
[3:20:46] Gaz_Games_: @flouflis that was before they fixed the cannon damage
[3:20:49] DaBo00: rip legendary
[3:20:58] Finaren_: @flouflis if They did it was pře nerf classes
[3:21:10] Nakovalny: The group setups are do diverse
[3:21:12] brotan123: why is the 29 not marked WR for echo
[3:21:21] Meeix: @brotan123 because its not a wr
[3:21:29] Meeix: group b had several ulda 29s
[3:21:36] CoTSmooth: Perplexed took the wr from them. Easy as thay
[3:21:39] Shearin77: @brotan123 cuz it was done in groups before
[3:21:51] Mindfull: Bro that is a stretch
[3:21:52] Tapes__: @flouflis wasn't even 1.5 and was with cannons
[3:22:01] Magnus27: !time
[3:22:09] goonerboi21: that would be insaneway to end, but wont happen
[3:22:13] kargaz_classic: That ULD 29 was an great run from Echo you see how the other Teams struggle
[3:22:28] orcahontas: oof
[3:22:31] Finaren_: Bonk
[3:22:32] potatoaimbotx: !scoreboard
[3:22:40] RichardPPPan: HUH
[3:22:41] thunderkoim: Buff Guardian !!
[3:22:45] Fatassfrodo: FH trash does a ton of damage
[3:22:46] risam_1742: was that naowh going human form?
[3:22:58] Shearin77: that 31 FH hits HARD
[3:23:00] potatoaimbotx: #showscoreboard
[3:23:00] atrame: @risam_1742 no lol
[3:23:04] orcahontas: i think guardian needs a buff Kappa
[3:23:11] Magnoks: Naow swapped from tauren to nelf
[3:23:13] EzzLyfe: just press fur tho
[3:23:24] Ladiplace: toy?
[3:23:28] simoncs: @Magnoks He played nelf all day
[3:23:33] johzi94: on what site can you watch the live routes of the teams?
[3:23:33] MindhackerTV: Maybe he didnt healed him because he didnt used all his defensives xD
[3:23:40] Finaren_: Lets go perplexed you can get em
[3:23:42] goonerboi21: Naowh needs to hit Death Strike when he low hp, someone tell him pls
[3:23:43] XueAndDende: They should kite them a little more :D
[3:24:19] Ladiplace: I heard pressing W helps
[3:24:19] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/TGPS2Finals
[3:24:21] blasern1: WR at the dungeon name is World Record? Shouldn't Echo have WR on Uld 29? highest ever even over live servers. @Warcraft
[3:24:41] JeroenNietDoen1979: So Echo for 30 VP, would that be an option @tettles
[3:24:41] Meeix: @blasern1 Group B already had several 29s
[3:24:42] Meeix: so no
[3:24:43] z3popa: @blasern1 Done in group B
[3:24:51] Demanisraar: @blasern1 I think group b did faster
[3:24:52] Snayderino: @blasern1 someone mentioned earlier that in Group B there were some 29 Uldas
[3:24:53] DaBo00: @blasern1 it's not a WR though
[3:24:55] Finaren_: @blasern1 no cup B had faster 29
[3:24:57] Ragzoor: !gear
[3:24:57] Moobot: @Ragzoor Live gear: https://inspect.gcd.tv/
[3:24:58] BobDaUnicorn: @blasern1 Perplex did it faster
[3:25:03] blasern1: aa ok thanks :D
[3:25:03] stiggitystaigs: @blasern1 i think perplexed has faster time
[3:25:07] XueAndDende: @blasern1 it's the time they do it in, if a 18 is doen faster than the 29, then the 28 is the wr
[3:25:08] Lilploobx: How is NA’s last hope doing?
[3:25:19] Asburela: @PlooshxD Unlucky as hell
[3:25:29] Asburela: @PlooshxD 0.003s depleted on Vortex 29
[3:25:33] Lilploobx: What happened
[3:25:43] Asburela: And 3 min depleted on Vortex 29 lost a lot of time
[3:25:51] simoncs: @PlooshxD Depleted VP29 twice, once with 0.003 seconds, and once with 3 seconds
[3:26:22] Lilploobx: Has anybody else depleted?
[3:26:23] flouflis: @Meeix on fortified only, or it doesn't matter?
[3:26:31] Finaren_: Last hope are drained mentally poor guys
[3:26:35] WinterwolfSC: naowh monkaS
[3:26:40] Athena_Garlies: doesnt matter
[3:26:42] Meeix: @Meeix doesnt matter
[3:27:23] tettles: @JeroenNietDoen1979 Mmmmmm, I dont think so
[3:27:25] charlezzsszz: Naowhs selfhealing rofl
[3:27:26] masterplaster91: swag couldve dispersed
[3:27:27] ninja_gecko1: I like your casting Meeix
[3:27:29] tettles: I think the only doable key here is like 31 FH for echo
[3:27:32] lockdown_sypher1: dont think 31 FH is douable
[3:27:38] juanmrbbnero: What one shoted the Pala?
[3:27:44] Meeix: @ninja_gecko1 thank you, glad you enjoy it
[3:27:49] RichardPPPan: comp this Joel meta that Joel im just a fisk Joel fisking in twitch chat Joel
[3:27:56] tettles: in all honesty, I think if Echo times 31 FH that is just the checkmate position
[3:28:05] k3nny271: i think they just need better rng with shots to do 31fh
[3:28:06] PengoOoO: echo best team in the world
[3:28:15] goonerboi21: echo just gonna be chilling in this 31 till times up
[3:28:17] Snayderino: is 31 underrot not an option here over the 31 FH?
[3:28:21] charlezzsszz: @tettles true
[3:28:31] norunkai1989: @tettles obviously..^^
[3:28:37] juanmrbbnero: What killed the paladin?
[3:28:42] Athena_Garlies: Is there any other dungeon they could do? or are they just stuck on 31 FH?
[3:28:50] Finaren_: @tettles I think They checkmate by the 30 hoi
[3:28:50] ozantus: if perplexed manages the 30 halls echo will for sure be doing runs to improve on time
[3:29:04] norunkai1989: @juanmrbbnero add dmg... 100%
[3:29:06] tettles: UR timer was too close to go a key level higher
[3:29:06] kargaz_classic: I guess it was the pistol shoot from the Boss what oneshoot the Pala
[3:29:09] k3nny271: @garlies2 31fh or 31bh
[3:29:18] Meeix: @tettles what about the BH
[3:29:19] PengoOoO: its already over
[3:29:19] Moobot: Learn more about The Great Push! https://blizz.ly/TGP2023
[3:29:22] Kelthiz: @garlies2 Their 30 FH timer is really good, so I think it's their better bet.
[3:29:31] xyandraa: at what point do Echo start think about getting better times on already ran dungeons
[3:29:34] EzzLyfe: Dratnos you are forgetting that timed tiebreaker doesnt look at key level. So for timed tiebreaker a 29 HOI will be better than a 30
[3:29:35] Meeix: i think 31BH might be > 31FH but both of these keys are walls ...

[4:16:45] kaverrr: Gingi still have a huge storage of ELX for personal use. That's also cheating.

[4:33:15] dragoon2k: @capitainemort I think an argument for getting the WR back in VP 29 is another thing they could do and if they truely think the 31 is impossible based on time I would rather go for having the best time in all six dungeons
[4:33:16] sonic_gravity: I studied numbers as an engineer. i'm really good at 6 and 9

[5:09:14] Tremin: @Tremin Like going for the 29 is kind of pointless if they just lose the tiebreaker anyways
[5:09:17] Goliathse: 113%
[5:09:33] brotan123: 3 deaths 5 mins in is certainly not the way to improve the timer
[5:09:34] Goliathse: @Kenny_Marsh 113% ish

[5:10:02] quarkoffel: @Kichiro22 It is
[5:10:21] faleley: Soo fun seeing two teams going for gamba decision
[5:10:21] Wcranee: Echo wins thats important to me:D
[5:10:23] Nidalee55: just do a 32 minute +30 4Head
[5:10:32] sonic_gravity: @Tremin im not an expert, but leggo is on 28 vp and everyone else timed a 29, and your big early pulls is where you die on vp, so seems vp should do vp 29 imo, but wtf do i know I've only ever beat a 20 so yeah

[5:10:54] bobbyj1585: I agree with naguura… they have like a full minute to make up in this hoi
[5:10:58] KeicyX: how much longer does tgp go?

[5:11:16] quarkoffel: @Kichiro22 Yeah so? It technically is part of MDI
[5:11:17] Tremin: @sonic_gravity my point is if they do a vp 29 and still just get 4th place, what is the point? they want to get 2nd which is plausible if they are the only other hoi 30 team
[5:11:18] lovelywaz: Mathnos strikes again! 😎😎
[5:11:25] Meeix: @sonic_gravity they do 30 HoI because the first tiebreaker is highest dungeon so a 30 HoI is more valuable than a 29 VP
[5:11:30] bobbyj1585: No one timing the 30… making up time in the 29 is BiS
[5:11:41] falysae: NA's last hope should go to Freehold 30. They had a horrible run there, they can make a lot of time there
[5:11:46] Skittlebeast: legendary going 30 hoi
[5:11:48] sonic_gravity: oic
[5:11:50] kichiro84: @quarkoffel LuL
[5:11:50] quarkoffel: @Kichiro22 Not that it matters tho
[5:12:05] falysae: And if they do, what perplexed is doing is pointless so they win
[5:12:15] bobbyj1585: Ya that’s smart too falysae… 30fh for na last hope
[5:12:20] seteleechete: If either of those teams trained the BH tech they could save a lot of time there as well
