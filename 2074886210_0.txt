[0:11:04] 4chinit: this is a one sided relationship, we're giving them money for their time

[0:14:46] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[1:32:27] What_ln_Tarnation: tree fitty
[1:32:47] zachgamegodx: feel like they're a bit lost on that comp
[1:32:49] zachgamegodx: lepomp
[1:32:55] skydog70: can they fix glimpse bug or its a totally fine mechanic i guess
[1:33:08] zachgamegodx: whaazz was saying it on his watch party
[1:33:18] realdreadx: Hello Cdewlicious
[1:33:37] tommymage: he was saying he doesnt think rmd should beat dh/lock/rsham but kubzy did
[1:33:57] tommymage: but kubzy did beat them
[1:33:59] dipicat: @tommymage bro raikus team played shimmer
[1:34:03] dipicat: and played in middle of map
[1:34:06] dipicat: and kubzy is literally NEVER in my los
[1:34:11] dipicat: its like a diff comp
[1:34:12] tommymage: well you also
[1:34:13] dipicat: lmao
[1:34:14] tommymage: stayed back
[1:34:19] zachgamegodx: nah he was saying lepomp was doing no dmg
[1:34:20] tommymage: and played like could die
[1:34:28] dipicat: @tommymage ive played that matchup into kubzy a thousand times
[1:34:30] dipicat: and tried everything
[1:34:32] dipicat: never beat them
[1:34:35] dipicat: yeah they just "toy with us" too

[1:34:55] dipicat: kubzy has a completely unique style
[1:35:03] What_ln_Tarnation: wasnt kubzy a main healer?
[1:35:06] Karaelolz: kubzy looked really hard to beat in general
[1:35:14] dipicat: if i could play dh destro into an arcane mage playing shimmer tho id be pretty happy ngl
[1:35:17] dipicat: that sounds like the freest win
[1:35:27] tommymage: they also played blink stun btw
[1:35:30] Karaelolz: spellstealing 90 out of 100 globals is not replicable by other mages apparently
[1:35:55] Karaelolz: yeah just kidding its just frustrating
[1:36:14] knappster15: @Karaelolz if it was that simple everyone would play arcane mage
[1:36:38] realdreadx: Kubzy is lucky mitch isnt around playing arcane
[1:36:42] bignoooodle: ya hes a rdruid main originally
[1:36:49] tommymage: but i wouldnt say thats the factor in my mind sitting back to lose to boomy rog every game in damp and never trying to play to win
[1:36:50] tommymage: is odd
[1:36:55] ItsMeDay: i wish kubzy streamed
[1:37:09] tommymage: like maro and them didnt do that
[1:37:11] Karaelolz: its not only kubzy, his rogue is playing very well too
[1:37:12] tommymage: but we will see
[1:37:53] qkmood: @ItsMeDay he does occasionally
[1:38:02] actualreallifebillionaire: they are okay, my RMD on taiwan server never lose, 4k rating, some call us win trader but whatever
[1:38:17] Neji513: if luminosity played, what comp do you think they would've played
[1:38:27] sixthycent: yea the move has great cross CC
[1:38:44] Neriakied: people underestimate how insane it is when someone really knows how to do max dmg
[1:38:45] qkmood: the cross region stuff always cool to watch
[1:38:49] Neji513: isn't niksi boomkin/rogue
[1:39:08] realdreadx: When is it

[1:39:51] actualreallifebillionaire: here we go the shadowplay story
[1:40:01] 101Leet: You're better at the mirror you're better at the mirror, nothing more nothing less
[1:40:05] mayfire15: if you only played pres with rogue boomkin you’d probably lose a lot more
[1:40:09] chachio_dk: mirrors can just mean who is better in the mirror. people are better at different things imo
[1:40:12] gammerinno: hey my friends a big fan can you say hello to him? his name is Mike Oxlong thanks
[1:40:18] tommymage: i think this tourney is rly wild that blizz thinks its ok to have real money involved
[1:40:27] Neriakied: the meta can change who wins the mirror too tbh
[1:40:29] zachgamegodx: lg beat the move in mirrors in overall
[1:40:30] actualreallifebillionaire: @cdewx shadowplay story you know you want to
[1:40:46] Karaelolz: no pres is better than you Im afraid
[1:40:53] stelthroguen: cdew like a vampire and doesnt show up in mirrors
[1:40:56] zachgamegodx: no debate rlly for me anyway
[1:41:01] kurtzenberg: Hugh Janis
[1:41:02] bynded: mine does too
[1:41:02] actualreallifebillionaire: you lost shadowplay mirrors or something in cata i swear ive heard you say that before
[1:41:12] Neji513: @zachgamegodx to be fair, i don't think anyone beat them in any mirrors (best of 3).
[1:41:47] zachgamegodx: @Neji513 the move doesn't win many major tournies dont think they ever have won anything outside cupstage
