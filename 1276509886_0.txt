[0:34:30] Deathraid82: with that mount... i wouldn't see them doing that. too much uproar. If they offer it in other realms it will be live for sure.
[0:34:52] Alcade_IJ: I would like it on all types that way that the market for the $5000 code go BOOM
[0:34:56] Deathraid82: that's a CRAZY rare TGC mount

[0:56:38] BLARGO_: Do we think alliance will fill back out when cross faction raiding/M+ comes out?
[0:57:04] Kinghorn: nope, the damage is done
[0:57:19] Eggz1004: unlikely
[0:57:36] dalaraz: @Blarg why would a horde player pay to go alliance cause of cross :/
[0:57:49] SagaXLR: Is it worth getting back into wow again? took a break and now want to come back but keep hearing it is dying... I hear that all the time eme even when it wasn't just figure I reach out
[0:57:53] jerexify: @dalaraz Aesthetics.
[0:58:02] jerexify: @dalaraz And that's it.
[0:58:05] BLARGO_: Dwarves are the best race so yeah
[0:58:09] BLARGO_: that's why
[0:58:12] AmaritheTV: ^
[0:58:22] SSD511_: @sagaxlr nothing change still the same
[0:58:26] Gingerprimer: Depending on what they do with racials when cross faction comes out a few highend M+ gorups might go dwarf+nelfs
[0:58:27] dalaraz: @jerexify if its just aesthetics,it will be a very minor number
[0:58:39] LordKain73: Alliance turksKEKW
[0:58:46] jerexify: @dalaraz For sure, yeah. Very few people willing to spend an additional $25 just for that.
[0:58:50] yokai_5: @Blarg that is true , worgens / iron dwarves too
[0:58:52] jerexify: Or $30 or whatever it is.
[0:58:59] BLARGO_: I am willing to bet they drop cross faction grouping in 9.2.5 to hold us over until the new expansion
[0:59:23] LordKain73: Orc = master race
[0:59:36] BLARGO_: Why zug zug when you can have a monster beard
[0:59:39] mateolaa: Alliance  have better  lore characters imo
[0:59:42] AmaritheTV: if horde so good why they loose a majority of BGs, just sayin
[0:59:48] Okri24: it would be cool to see a new raid when both factions have to work together in the same group
[0:59:49] dalaraz: @jerexify i mean,if you care to raid and you are in a guild in horde you wont change, then if you just care about aesthetics you are what you want already. i cant see transfers happening at any considerable scale
[1:00:07] cruzeal: towStop towIt
[1:00:46] BLARGO_: But cross faction grouping will stem the tide of transfers and allow more player agency when rolling new toons. Friends will get to play with friends again. @dalaraz
[1:00:48] hddndoors: if things are cross faction , it wont matter
[1:00:59] pixxelina: catJAM
[1:01:10] SonofHorus82: Warcraft movie soundtrack Kreygasm
[1:01:18] cruzeal: i hope we get cross faction in the future i'd make my pally a human lol
[1:01:28] BLARGO_: it is 100% coming

[1:01:35] TSquadSully: this soundtrack bangs
[1:01:48] yokai_5: bald old human monk Pog
[1:02:17] coltrton: is there a link to the update? did i miss it?
[1:02:18] Okri24: @cruzeal we need them gobo and gnome paladins
[1:02:18] Deathraid82: Big oof with Raven's Union denial. Still gonna happen but oof.
[1:02:20] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[1:02:32] cruzeal: @okri24 idk about goblin paladins lol
[1:02:36] dalaraz: @Blarg true,for new toons it might work,but 25$ is way too much for people to bother,they can play together without transfering anyway if factnion opens
[1:02:36] SonofHorus82: fucking love the Warcraft movie. It's not for everyone, but I really liked it.
[1:03:00] yokai_5: worgen shamans NODDERS
[1:03:01] BLARGO_: You know, the toy from Mount Hyjal that turns you into a NE that is on fire hits different after Teldrassil.

[1:03:10] cruzeal: vulpera druids Kappa
[1:03:30] BLARGO_: Leyara's Locket OMEGALUL
[1:03:58] Okri24: @cruzeal thing is if any class can be priest and in Legion a Priest converted to Paladin means any race that can be priests should get paladins aswell imo
[1:04:03] Zippaya: glexing with new mount
[1:04:07] Korupcija_: CARRIED LOL!

[1:04:57] Synonymous: mmm nice and healthy
[1:05:03] cruzeal: @okri24 towClap
[1:05:04] BLARGO_: Blizzard needs to allow Night Elves to be Mages, so they can be a fire Mage PepeWhy
[1:05:18] neomonstr: @514Skyline 9.1.5 has good catchup-mechanics and stuff, and 9.2 is coming in probably like a month, could be worth coming back to catch up prior to the new content :-)
[1:05:27] Kinghorn: 15k dont spend it all in 1 place
[1:05:29] mavericks312: i dont think night elves want anything to do with fire
[1:05:34] Synonymous: i thought NE could be mages
[1:05:35] Gingerprimer: @514Skyline when next patch hits it is going to be in a fine spot
[1:05:44] BLARGO_: @mavericks312 That is why we need it
[1:05:47] mercz514: Thanks for the answers guys!

[1:18:36] Aravarth: @Miguel85NYC Avocado Toast G Fuel facing off against Boomer Blast G Fuel

[1:18:47] pakamov: what about 10.0 when can we expect some sort of an announcement ?
[1:18:57] Zettabyte: Egg white GFuel Kappa
[1:19:04] codedizle: no thanks I like avocado but not as a drink LUL
[1:19:09] worthyy92: @Miguel85NYC Surely you mean Kale? LUL
[1:19:15] BLARGO_: Unless they just drop the shit outta nowhere
[1:19:16] sgtalash: towF towF towF towF
[1:19:25] yokai_5: still no news about supporting HOTS , they either going to shut it down or give it a big update , business wise that is the best thing to do PepeWhy
[1:19:32] joe_g_433: I am realistic… just looking for 9.2 for now.
[1:19:54] jarilrpg: don't get why people are asking for 10.0 news when the last raid isn't even out yet and no events are announced
[1:19:54] aptrist: just got here, what expansion?
[1:20:02] flebbooo: They let people know atleast 3-4 weeks prior to legion announcement at gamescom
[1:20:02] dugarg_: How long do the argent dailies take?
[1:20:06] Dinkyfrost: like donot take a holiday around these dates ?
[1:20:12] mavericks312: @yokai_5 i dont expect any HoTs news till MS takes over at the earliest at this point
[1:20:26] StalkerBub: Avocado wit Mayonnaise and lemon juice?
[1:20:26] BLARGO_: HotS won't get anything
[1:20:30] truf4x: its not even 9.2 and ppl want the newer thing? lol
[1:20:31] BLARGO_: it is in maintenance mode
[1:21:07] Akoudadis: Listen up guys! Towel knows shit! Towel knows lots of shit
[1:21:08] yokai_5: @Blarg then they will shut it down , probably next year sadly
[1:21:24] Hazeness: @dugarg way to long lolol
[1:21:29] Sollice: I would expect HotS to be fully dead and no hope of revival with the announcement of the new Blizzard survival game
[1:21:46] ashwing_: 10.0 is for noobs 11.0 is where its at LUL
[1:21:55] pakamov: I say fall 2023 is when the next expansion hits
[1:21:58] BLARGO_: 10.0 1st week of December, with the raid unlocking mid January
[1:22:06] Holysal: they are.
[1:22:12] Alcade_IJ: Honestly I am willing to wait for a year
[1:22:20] Screamnsteam: what exactly is a survival game, what can you compare it too?
[1:22:29] Deathraid82: Forest
[1:22:32] Deathraid82: Scum
[1:22:32] shroomzy: 9.2 Feb 22nd? or is that too soon you think? Not assuming you know just curious your speculations:)
[1:22:34] longhauler4ever: @towelliee do you think the level cap will ever be raised again?

[1:22:43] Deathraid82: Valheim
[1:22:47] Sollice: @Screamnsteam We have no idea.
[1:22:53] Sollice: Survival game is a very broad term
[1:23:05] Ispintowin: What is the name for the survival game they are making @towelliee ?
[1:23:07] CrusaderNero: booo pet battle weekly
[1:23:07] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee I have a guildie that swears up and down that 9.2 is coming out on Feb 15 whats your thoughts?
[1:23:08] BLARGO_: I am willing to bet it will be like Valheim
[1:23:09] Kisswani: Kisswani subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! towHi
[1:23:21] flebbooo: HE KNOWS POGGERS
[1:23:26] Deathraid82: Yeah. I mean there are  TON of ways they could do it too. SO many possible ways to implement a survival game.
[1:23:27] yokai_5: @Sollice HOTS still have a big community players that plays it and support it , but the thing is , these numbers aren't what blizzard want ..
[1:23:38] smashwow: if tier sets be bugging out, it's fine. ship it. Kappa
[1:23:48] Deathraid82: same @Blarg
[1:24:07] yokai_5: @Sollice and MS will not revive a dead game as the devs before them ignore it Pepehand
[1:24:13] Sollice: @yokai_5 HotS has no monetization model that works I was a HotS DIE HARD. Most played game and like 20+ level 30+ characters and I NEVER felt compelled to use money on anything
[1:24:22] majinprae: majinprae subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:24:46] BLARGO_: @Sollice Hero rotations killed monetization for HotS
[1:24:52] Niksen_99: Did you like this raid back in the day ?
[1:25:01] Deathraid82: Yo hots cosmetic and champion acquisitions were VERY unmonetized friendly.
[1:25:07] Sollice: @Blarg Yep.
[1:25:16] Niksen_99: No trash... in heaven :D
[1:25:24] gooni_coyg: OMG Towelliee.. Just got the legendary bow on hunter on third try. Best 150.000 gold spent :D
[1:25:30] Bl4ckSauce: i did this realm first back then
[1:25:35] CharpieX: used to love when this was the weekly raid because of how fast it was
[1:25:37] Holysal: @Blarg that doesnt hurt LoL bc of the amount of players?
[1:25:44] Sollice: One of the more interesting things I saw Smite do years ago was you could pay like $30 as a one time fee and you would get every hero released in the future
[1:25:48] Sollice: I really like that
[1:25:59] BLARGO_: @Holysal League roster is so huge that it didn't matter
[1:26:03] Havoc_S1: It was my first real raid with a guild
[1:26:04] yokai_5: @Sollice exactly , i play HOTS a lot too , so what i think MS will do either kill the game forever , or revive it with benefits .
[1:26:08] rampagerhyno: Good morning @Towelliee !
[1:26:09] Holysal: @Blarg oh ok
[1:26:16] Deathraid82: @Holysal LoL has a LOT more champs and their free rotation is usually only a few champs
[1:26:20] Ispintowin: I was watching someone play the PTR earlier he was getting mad because the WQs is giving 100 rep and not give him 225 the quest he turned in it gave him 250 rep and he uses like 5 spells if I watch him test out raid stuff and complain that he is like top 15 in DPS
[1:26:40] Sollice: HoTS has potential. It's a moba that is roster IP based. Now with Microsoft they can flush that game with so many other characters
[1:26:45] Gingerprimer: To support a F2p model you either need to have tons of pay to win thigns or your game needs to be massive like LOL/TF2 and stuff
[1:27:02] Sollice: That may give it some life to see Masterchief in HoTS rising a warthog as his mount
[1:27:12] Sollice: riding*
[1:27:24] Alcade_IJ: I like rising better
[1:27:25] Nar0ah: Do not dismount
[1:27:28] juga27: just unlocked flying in shadowlands woot! :D
[1:27:30] Nar0ah: fith while riding
[1:27:35] Nar0ah: fight*
[1:27:39] Mallaes: Try another spell?
[1:27:42] mavericks312: master chief, doom guy and fenyx would boost HoTs alot
[1:27:45] Ispintowin: They did and I was to myself getting 100 and 250 is better then getting like 50 and 30 rep for them
[1:27:49] VordiDi: don't take the lance off
[1:27:52] Nyytro84: why is it people reference MrGM all the time, does he know someone at blizz the guy has like no viewers just curious
[1:28:05] jerexify: @Towelliee Try Judgement first, killing just one at a time, instead of shield. Maybe? /shrug
[1:28:05] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee yeah flying will only take like 2 weeks now
[1:28:08] Eggz1004: hit them with a mounted ability, then destroy them
[1:28:13] Deathraid82: @Towelliee are you working on ATT?
[1:28:19] BLARGO_: 200+ equals zero apparently OMEGALUL
[1:28:22] Sollice: @mavericks312 Yep. We will see. It would be interesting to see if Mike Y likes HotS and could convince Phil to keep it
[1:28:22] Nyytro84: ahh gotcha cool
[1:28:35] Kisswani: KEKW
[1:28:36] Sollice: @Nyytro84 Youtube I think is more his thing?
[1:28:47] Ispintowin: And he live streams PTR
[1:28:48] Sollice: speaking of which
[1:28:48] Dinermoe: yo can i farm renown in comp stomp?

[2:58:10] swordart_19: savage KEKW
[2:58:17] Deathraid82: Did they change it? just reward the mount for the WQ? it used to be a chance at either the mount or the pet.

[3:02:42] Deathraid82: same mount essentially but a flying version
[3:02:56] Screamnsteam: KEKW
[3:03:03] swordart_19: Didn't he missed orb
[3:03:05] Derkiejerkie: he probably missed a orb?
[3:03:17] Naamverloren: Ah man that shit is given me the pet instead of the mount
[3:03:17] Deathraid82: didn't click them in order maybe? or missed one.
[3:03:30] Zippaya: when I did this, first 3 was pet than a mount
[3:03:34] Fafnyir: I had the world quest though

[3:04:02] ChimneyTV: Chat ,is this true,Chinese Realms Bundle Swift Spectral Tiger Mount for Six Month Subscription in Burning Crusade Classic??
[3:04:04] maccaruso: Sometimes the WQ doesn't register.  Fly away and come back.
[3:04:11] cabalish: @Fafnyir try again dude
[3:04:16] Deathraid82: I get it. But i like that there are mounts specific to swimming. To each i suppose. @reggieswag14
[3:04:16] simonbgg: RIP Blackhand, such a Good boss!
[3:04:33] postman_quest: Seems to be impossible on lfr
[3:04:39] jerexify: @Fafnyir If you had the WQ on your map, then you did the puzzle right. You just need to wait for the boss to spawn again.
[3:04:45] Short_Film: Its fine, sometimes you need to take a step back and recharge
[3:04:54] tavon1998: wonder how hard the jailer fight will be on mythic
[3:05:10] luckfore: 9.1 is worst patch since 6.1 so its understandable
[3:05:18] TheCliffyShow: It's a good ratio.
[3:05:41] OhNoNotAgain: TBH it was fun watching you enjoy yourself tho. You seem really energized again which is nice.
[3:05:43] RhadigarTV: I took a two month break and played LOTRO. I now play both LOTRO and WoW
[3:05:45] cbiskit89: hard to let your guild down but sometimes you gotta prioritize yourself
[3:05:45] rivera9: lol i quit during 9.0
[3:05:58] Deathraid82: Yep. It's nice to feel that excitement to come back after taking a break. Makes the game feel better personally.
[3:06:02] reggiepowa: whats the other one you didnt get?\
[3:06:26] Alexkayzz: gARROSH
[3:06:29] RhadigarTV: I didn't think I was going to come back but I did. And it's felt great coming back. And I'm now working at a WoW fansite again.

[3:15:15] TheCliffyShow: Even Nintendo has had down moments.
[3:15:30] andrewexiled: Craig Amai is the lead, and hes been off the wow team for years. So it must have been longer then 2 years. Unless there was another project in that time.

[3:16:20] drinkmorewaterhahaha: overwatch was soo big when it came out
[3:16:26] drinkmorewaterhahaha: the hype was crazy
[3:16:28] ArcaneSyntax: overwatch still isn't bad, it just hasn't got any content updates in a while because ow2
[3:16:31] TheCliffyShow: People are attracted to negativity.
[3:16:31] Duekov: I don't know, WoD > Legion > BfA > SL is pretty bad track record for 8 years. Legion is the highlight in there :v
[3:16:33] Jango_: I would say its going to be good based on their track record
[3:16:40] brozzy: They’re amazing at launching a new IP every 5 years then letting it die krippWeird
[3:16:43] Calkoi: Any content you want in the next xpac (new class, new pve type, new pvp content etc.)

[3:17:00] Blah206: Nobody has a better track record or pedigree. Maybe Take Two with GTA and that's about it. Blizzard does it with multiple IP's though.
[3:17:03] mavericks312: legion and bfa were good xpacs
[3:17:05] hallsgamingtv: numbers talk @Towelliee
[3:17:07] brianlawl: ya sl worst xpac
[3:17:11] ryanc1124: loved WoD tbh fuck SL
[3:17:11] brianlawl: cata better
[3:17:13] swordart_19: @duekov Pog for me all
[3:17:15] Duekov: Very true, just an opinion. And you're right, they have the #s on their side
[3:17:19] DrWraithjr: Blizzard is the most successful development studio of the last 20 years. Lately they have done poorly, but counting them out is foolish.
[3:17:20] dalaraz: sl is fine,if you just raid with your guild
[3:17:24] SicDogg: litchking was the best
[3:17:24] drinkmorewaterhahaha: YEP a ton of ppl are playing SL even when a lot of ppl think wow is in a bad state
[3:17:27] RhadigarTV: Woah woah woah. Cataclysm was the best expansion of all time there @Towelliee.... lol
[3:17:33] dracullus: Draenor still sold like hot cakes, and Legion after it the same
[3:17:36] Jango_: Look at at the survival genre, all those games are buggy ass early access piles of trash
[3:17:38] woodnf: God I miss WoD.  The only thing I had to grind was for my legendary.
[3:17:39] dalaraz: depends on why 1 doesnt like shadowlands
[3:17:42] Deathraid82: cata prepatch was fun!
[3:17:43] queeflabs: i didnt mind cata, it was Spine that sucked fat balls
[3:17:44] Jango_: the most complete survival game is rust
[3:17:49] dalaraz: i personaly dontcare bout lore etc so its just another xpac
[3:17:52] luckfore: i played alot more wod than SL tbh
[3:17:52] pixxelina: 100%
[3:17:54] PToastman: SL is blizzard bad. Not bad bad imo
[3:17:59] HbcMomo: @Towelliee I just came back right before 9.1 dropped.  I hadn't played since WoD.  I actually got my wife to try the game this time and shes loving it which in turn adds to my enjoyment
[3:18:04] TheCliffyShow: That's the mentality of the internet as a whole.
[3:18:08] Gadgari: But if we come Back to LK the number will race i think
[3:18:09] reggiepowa: just log in and raid, thats all there is to do in wod
[3:18:11] Yoitsnova: because raids and specs were good and he was just entering hardcore raiding
[3:18:11] c0mmander_starscream: The people that hate all WoW expansions read reddit way too much
[3:18:12] okwaman: I'm actually enjoying Shadowlands
[3:18:13] brianlawl: I never quit and my best xpac was mop. so much fun
[3:18:15] dalaraz: draenor was the best 1st patch of an expansion,we jsut didnt get a second ever
[3:18:19] Electafuzz: the raids in WoD were it's saving grace
[3:18:23] DallTV_: that as my dads view if we dont have the same opinion as him we are ideots
[3:18:28] aNxje: I left during legion foe work reasons so left whenit was good then came back to this shit
[3:18:30] gurunoni: WODS raids were good. Same with music
[3:18:30] Deathraid82: hes a hard core raider. Its all subjective. EVERYTHING is. Whether the game is good or not its subjective. The only metric you can use is statistics.
[3:18:33] Blah206: BIG TRUE
[3:18:33] drinkmorewaterhahaha: @Thead_Enco  I think most of those reddit ppl cry about wow on reddit but still play the game
[3:18:37] andrewexiled: didnt PvPers like WoD as well? I seem to remember
[3:18:41] c0mmander_starscream: "This game is shit, hear me roar"\
[3:18:44] Blah206: Tell them how it is Towel
[3:18:45] TakeThatBack: blizzards bad track record what? what blizzard game launch was not great?
[3:18:45] 3DMikeGG: Draenor raiding top tier, only expac i didnt quit during
[3:18:49] brianlawl: ya mop and wod had good pvp
[3:18:51] geokouts: i raided more on WoD rather on other expantions
[3:18:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: Community gonna be shit, based on track record Kappa
[3:19:09] tebbix: Oh did you got back TopGun
[3:19:13] luckfore: topgun Kappa
[3:19:20] Deathraid82: Hots is a GREAT game.
[3:19:31] hallsgamingtv: how many players does LOL atm??
[3:19:34] Qargory: hots was okay, but if i was to play that type of game, id play league
[3:19:37] Alienfromger: blizzard comes years to late to survival games tho
[3:19:39] vadder_fister: ow launch best time in gaming
[3:19:39] bowsers1: i really liked corruptions unlike the majority
[3:19:45] Duekov: I think Blizzard's most recent track record is pretty bad though. WC3 reforged, D2 remastered had a terrible launch (great game though), SL. But you are correct, their entire history they have a good track record. Recent though, it is down for sure.
[3:19:47] SagaXLR: OW was insane when it launched
[3:19:48] RhadigarTV: I'll be honest. I'm going through WoD now on my retail characters and it's honestly not as bad as I remembered
[3:19:48] Blah206: Overwatch won goty and sold 50+ million copies lol
[3:19:48] egraves7: overwatch at launch was the most fun it ever was
[3:19:54] jipsplade: dota 2 mS
[3:20:02] OnePlayerPete: @Alienfromger Which games are the 'big dogs' in the survival space right now?
[3:20:02] swordart_19: Haters gotta hate LUL
[3:20:04] Qargory: they add skins Kappa
[3:20:12] death_cam_: they had 1 hero since ow2 announcement tbh
[3:20:20] reinhardtdog: Overwatch is still played, and enough players you don't wait long for a match.  Had a new update on skins and holiday just yesterday
[3:20:39] TheGaoSora: @Towelliee that;s because that nerd dude made Death of a Game about OW so they now puke the same crap he said in the vid
[3:20:45] nasargielcreep: overwatch for casuals is still good
[3:20:46] queeflabs: @OnePlayerPete  none, because the genre has fallen out of favour with alot of casual gamers.
[3:20:51] Alienfromger: @Alienfromger eg valheim and all these kind of games
[3:20:58] Deathraid82: When you try a new genre of game you will always compete against other ESTABLISHED IP's. HoTs didn't survive as well because LoL is a very established MOBA. Same in reverse for MMO's.
[3:21:09] OnePlayerPete: @queeflabs The it's ripe for this new game to own the genre.
[3:21:16] Blah206: Hots is fire <3
[3:21:18] Deathraid82: Doesn't mean its bad. Just not as good as its competition.
[3:21:19] DrWraithjr: There are 14k people watching Overwatch right now on Twitch. FF 14 has 8 for reference.
[3:21:23] Duekov: Let's just say, Blizzard used to make a game and I'd know I was gonna buy it, insta hype. This new game release, they have to make some amends from their last few years performance
[3:21:25] Blah206: Reforged the only real slip imo
[3:21:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: HotS announcement trailer was hype when it released
[3:21:29] flyingbufanda: I still play HOTS. It is fun. Me and my boys play it 3-5 nights a week.
[3:21:30] reinhardtdog: Which is too bad, because HotS is still fun.
[3:21:37] Electafuzz: I think heroes is still fun - just a bummer they don't really support it anymore
[3:21:38] DallTV_: they should had hired that dude there did make dota in the first place :P
[3:21:40] Akitor123: bigger than wod
[3:21:45] Rudric_Ice: Hots 2.0 kinda killed the game
[3:21:49] Deathraid82: HOTS is incredibly fun.
[3:21:52] PToastman: That is fair
[3:21:53] flyingbufanda: It's not a long queue. Like 2 minutes tops
[3:21:54] Darzetti_: HOTS is still fun to play
[3:21:54] queeflabs: @OnePlayerPete depends on whether the player base feels like ANY survival title by virtue of it being just that, warrants their interest.. i used to love them, personally now i wouldnt touch them with a bargepole
[3:22:01] TheCliffyShow: I've been wanting to play HotS and Hearthstone.
[3:22:06] Blah206: tell em' how it izz
[3:22:10] andrewexiled: @Alienfromger survival is still a healthy genre and still growing. Theres room for a big polished AAA version IMO.
[3:22:25] TheCliffyShow: People are attracted to negativity and drama.
[3:22:27] Blah206: @andrewexiled agreed
[3:22:30] axellent_x: "what have you done for me lately"
[3:22:33] Deathraid82: I think if they are going to get into survival they HAVE to do it now. If they wait too long the ship will sail.
[3:22:35] OnePlayerPete: @queeflabs Hopefully the new game can entice you back in.
[3:22:38] medanmarko: Because Blizzard had an incredible 20 years, these 1,5-2 years are glaring and that's the reason why people are focused on them.
[3:22:39] PToastman: Hearthstone is still probobly the most polished mobile game too.  That or genshin
[3:22:44] Templexx: yea thers a lot of projects they dont even tell anyone
[3:22:50] Heero_Effect: I thought the Starcraft people left
[3:22:53] cbiskit89: I think for them to announce that just means that they knew that it would leak as soon as the job posts went up. Just get ahead of the leaks
[3:22:53] duffluv22: I like Fallout survival style games
[3:22:54] Electafuzz: TONS of games that never see the light of day
[3:22:58] PvtHudson093: starcraft ghost
[3:23:00] chickdrummer88: Survival games have been around for decades. The genre isn't going anywhere.
[3:23:01] Deathraid82: yep.
[3:23:05] TheCliffyShow: I bet there's still people raging over Starcraft Ghost.
[3:23:15] Heero_Effect: But I thought the Starcraft 2 team was solid
[3:23:16] Rudric_Ice: wish they showed some video  teaser rather than an image
[3:23:18] Padarius: people need to find a new game they enjoy, then go watch someone who plays it religiously and listen to them shit over it..just due to overplaying
[3:23:25] queeflabs: personally i want a large scale wargames style game like the old wastelands mod for arma 2

[3:23:29] Frenaris: 16 years plus
[3:23:30] PvtHudson093: like 15 years
[3:23:30] Deathraid82: what was that game they were making? Pantheon? It was different i think but i think it turned into OW?
[3:23:39] chickdrummer88: Titan
[3:23:42] Deathraid82: TITAN
[3:23:43] Deathraid82: yes
[3:23:44] Aquadriel: people keep saying "oh i wish we got titan instead of OW".. bitch titan didnt exist because it was probably trash for their own standards.
[3:23:44] rohdey: ghost was like 2003 wasn't it?
[3:23:45] Deathraid82: that was it.
[3:23:49] dragothicx: isn't Dance Studio finally coming in 9.2? LUL
[3:23:50] Electafuzz: MY DANCE STUDIO REEEEEE LUL
[3:23:55] RhadigarTV: @Towelliee Starcraft Ghost was 2002 so 20 years aho
[3:23:56] dragothicx: "Dance" Studio
[3:23:57] TheCliffyShow: I was hearing about the cancellation of Starcraft Ghost when I started WoW with Burning Crusade.
[3:24:11] Clicklesly: Iirc OW is basically just battlegrounds of Titan
[3:24:18] Navastro: I wonder if people would bitch if Blizzard announced StarCraft 3 instead of the new IP
[3:24:25] athalon: i had forgotten about the mounted combat from wrath now im mad again
[3:24:27] Deathraid82: yeah
[3:24:36] CordovaGC: @towelliee  don't forget about diablo 3 it's still being played its on season 25
[3:24:42] Deathraid82: I'd rather OW BUT they could possibly revisit? Maybe OW2 IS Titan?
[3:25:05] SmuttBudgie: voxel
[3:25:07] dragothicx: EQ Next had such good visuals
[3:25:15] andrewexiled: Bobby cant be too evil lol. Blizzard flushed 7 years down the tube on titan and still gave them another shot at another game.
[3:25:19] TheCliffyShow: I was dead convinced Titan was going to be a Starcraft MMO until they revealed Overwatch was the remains of it.
[3:25:29] PToastman: Diablo 3 isn’t half bad. It’s just worse than poe so it gets shot on
[3:25:38] herzlustafir: Its exiting times
[3:25:47] mavericks312: well EA still puts out its bad games lol
[3:25:47] reggiepowa: ubisoft just makes copies of 1 game
[3:25:48] athalon: imagine working your ass off making a game then playing it and being like man this game i made sucks ass
[3:26:07] chickdrummer88: RIP Anthem LUL
[3:26:09] Cafe0le: nope
[3:26:13] CtrlAltDel12345: lol no
[3:26:16] Yoitsnova: hasn't been the goat for a very long time
[3:26:18] trivotix: Diablo is the reason you have PoE
[3:26:20] Darzetti_: @chickdrummer88 yea poor anthem
[3:26:21] Aquadriel: poe fans spotted lmao
[3:26:21] BearManPig420: lol you live in a strange place
[3:26:24] rizuel23: they should have just rebranded EQ next into a builder type game cause they actually did a good job and it could have been a minecraft like game
[3:26:24] Austei: poe aka the speadshseet sim
[3:26:25] Gorektar: PoE2
[3:26:28] tomcruise210: PoE is dumb
[3:26:37] bladdes_00: EQ next actually HAD funding problems... they didn't make the money from Landmark .. thats why it was cancelled
[3:26:39] syla90: @tomcruise210 cause you are :D
[3:26:40] Sacura_Shadow: cant wait for diablo 4
[3:26:40] dalaraz: most poe players,where diablo players anyway
[3:26:41] tomcruise210: 5Head
[3:26:44] Aquadriel: yeah
[3:26:51] tomcruise210: @syla90 KEKW KEKW
[3:26:52] Cafe0le: poe is too far ahead of diablo
[3:26:53] dalaraz: plus poe playerbase is shrinking
[3:26:56] Electafuzz: I much prefer Diablo 3 to POE j/s
[3:26:57] BearManPig420: d2 popped off because d3 is trash
[3:26:58] DrWraithjr: PoE is a hardcore version of Diablo. One that you need a college degree in to play. D3 is a million times more accessible.
[3:27:00] kandor01: you need a phd for PoE and I have enough to deal with irl
[3:27:00] Tcrane_: yeah with rmah xD
[3:27:01] balanira: PoE is like dota and diablo is like league one complex the other easy to leran
[3:27:23] Aquadriel: @Towelliee diablo3 launch on switch got them a lot of new purchases even 8 years after the game fucking launched.. if that doesnt tell you about the success..
[3:27:25] Se7enthSinn: The first year of Diablo was bad
[3:27:26] Calphurnious: I don't see the fun of 1 shotting everything on my screen at all points in time in poe
[3:27:28] dragothicx: yeah Path of Building LUL
[3:27:29] piratechris: PoE BuildeR?
[3:27:36] brozzy: Path of building
[3:27:40] Blah206: LUL
[3:27:40] dalaraz: path of building yeah
[3:27:42] andrewexiled: PoE is very very niche. I bet D3 still has more players, at least near season launches. I prefer PoE though.
[3:27:42] Electafuzz: Yeah, I'm out lmao
[3:27:43] DrWraithjr: Having to build skill trees online because they are to complicated to build in game is absurd.
[3:27:44] bakurathewolf: LUL
[3:27:44] doubtymustafa: PoB
[3:27:45] pixxelina: LOL
[3:27:45] 3663Sharad: NotLikeThis
[3:27:46] Rudric_Ice: POE IS REALLY hard to get into
[3:27:48] medanmarko: PoE saved the ARPG genre. Without it we would be hard stuck with the disaster that was D3. And when D4 launches it has to compete with PoE and almost 30 expansions that it has. Yes, I'm a fanboy for PoE :D
[3:27:48] dragothicx: Microsoft Excel for PoE KEKW
[3:27:50] KingSlayerYotam: nope the fuck out
[3:27:52] Aquadriel: yeah
[3:27:52] dalaraz: thats to make it easier than it is :p
[3:27:56] Screamnsteam: talk about min maxing OMEGALUL
[3:27:59] athalon: can i major in POE path building?
[3:28:06] chickdrummer88: teenL
[3:28:09] 3663Sharad: YEP
[3:28:16] syla90: once you get into it its really the best theorycraftin in whole universe
[3:28:17] tomcruise210: that looks like the spread sheet they used for the HC Rag kill last saturday KEKW
[3:28:19] Tcrane_: i still love PoE :)
[3:28:25] maraz909: Low entry, high ceiling
[3:28:30] OnePlayerPete: Yeah, WoW is full of plebs
[3:28:34] Sacurra: Am Pleb can confirm
[3:28:38] iamviholt: Question: Do you think we get other announcements this week besides the new unannounced survival game?
[3:28:42] TheHardcorian: Imagine coming home from work and working through that KEKW
[3:28:47] TheHardcorian: Fak that
[3:28:50] PToastman: I quote
[3:28:52] TazzTheGrimreapper: i love POE, but that damn skill tree though...it is rough
[3:28:56] idenkaz_: poe is amazing i love it
[3:29:01] Aquadriel: poe fan opinoins LUL
[3:29:02] medanmarko: Yes, I was a D2 fanboi and I'm a PoE fanboi now :) over God know how many hours :D it scratches my itch.
[3:29:02] tomcruise210: no wonder quin sucks at PoE KEKW
[3:29:05] Electafuzz: Calling D3 a disaster is a stretch LUL
[3:29:08] ashwing_: they love it cuz its free
[3:29:08] codedizle: i always preferred the lore of Diablo over Poe and Poe i need a degree to play it Diablo i can jump and be just fine and have fun.
[3:29:17] Sacurra: Pleb here, can confirm Wow is good
[3:29:33] athalon: i make spreadsheets all day at work to go home and relax by making spread sheets for the game i play. SeemsGood
[3:29:35] Tcrane_: true
[3:29:37] medanmarko: @Electafuzz True, it made milions of $$$. I'm calling it a disaster for the ARPG genre.
[3:29:40] maraz909: D3 auction house was really bad idea thou
[3:29:42] jeffgamesttv: putting the real life ah in d3 was a disaster...
[3:29:43] razor_blazor: YUP
[3:29:44] Templexx: infernal mode
[3:29:44] Aquadriel: @Towelliee they sold a fuck ton of copies again when launched on switch, even after game launched 8 years ago.
[3:29:45] balanira: infenral
[3:29:45] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee pretty sure d3 is the best selling game on PC until Shadowlands I think
[3:29:46] dracullus: wasn't it most sold PC game on launch before SL?
[3:29:46] kandor01: Infernal mode
[3:29:47] TazzTheGrimreapper: the only thing about D3 is the respectiveness of it
[3:29:48] Templexx: hardcore
[3:29:49] HbcMomo: Only person to do it
[3:29:54] HbcMomo: well with krippi
[3:29:55] brozzy: REal money auction house in Diablo krippWeird
[3:30:04] Darzetti_: yea D3 real money AH was so bad
[3:30:07] Blah206: Diablo 3 launch was a bit of a mess. But 33 million copies sold don't lie.
[3:30:09] dalaraz: first d3 inferno kill was kripp yeah
[3:30:10] swordart_19: Never played diablo will play immortal
[3:30:11] Heero_Effect: I like Diablo 3 over Diablo 2
[3:30:15] chickdrummer88: @aquadriel I waited to buy a switch until the Diablo edition came out
[3:30:21] Elementlolz1: friend of mine is playing D3 and he says the game have much improvement from D2 idk why ppl hate it
[3:30:22] Aquadriel: inferno is the most brutal thing Blizzard has ever done, not to talk about HC
[3:30:22] Sacurra: That was like all of twitch
[3:30:32] Cafe0le: diablo would only have a chance to catch up if they went the full mmo route like lost ark
[3:30:34] Aquadriel: chickdrummer88 there you go!
[3:30:34] MDF2393: i think wows longevity gives people the impression that if a game isnt playable for years then it is a failure games can have a life span of a couple of years and still been a success
[3:30:42] Deathraid82: Infernal mode was so hard.
[3:30:45] balanira: if we talk about D3 vs PoE right now i think PoE has more playerbase but i dont think PoE can even compete with diablo 4 launch
[3:30:45] codedizle: d3 is in a fine spot now I still play it from time to time
[3:30:47] c0mmander_starscream: The auction houses prices for gear was nuts during release
[3:30:56] Templexx: i remember i tuned in on diablo. was so cool to watch
[3:31:02] Blah206: true
[3:31:05] ArcaneSyntax: I probably will play d4, i won't touch lost ark
[3:31:08] Deathraid82: We used to get one shot by the the flying mobs that spit out the flies in a line.
[3:31:11] dalaraz: d4 will pop the numbers,whatever it is
[3:31:19] c0mmander_starscream: Blizz can take my money for Diablo 4
[3:31:19] Kinghorn: I look at the poe skill tree and my eyes glaze over
[3:31:36] StalkerBub: u mean in consoles?
[3:31:36] Se7enthSinn: @Towelliee Diablo 4 or did you say you gained Renown from Comp Stomp??
[3:31:44] JohnStocktonsShorts: I started playing PoE during Betrayal league, one of the most complex, and I’m an idiot. If I figured out PoE anyone can
[3:32:01] worthyy92: @Kinghorn Same here, I saw some gameplay and I was hyped. Saw the talent system and was like nah fam.
[3:32:11] Aquadriel: Blizzard games slowly feed you with complexity as you level and progress so it doesnt feel bad for a new player if they let it NATURALLY discover all those things. @Towelliee
[3:32:33] DrWraithjr: In the ARPG genre, I still think Lost Ark will make a bigger splash than people think.
[3:32:37] codedizle: ngl I think immortal is fun
[3:32:38] chickdrummer88: towBlind
[3:32:40] Templexx: LOL
[3:32:43] Cafe0le: comp stomp is a godsend for renown and honor Kreygasm
[3:32:49] iamviholt: Question: Do you think we get other announcements this week besides the new unannounced survival game?
[3:32:50] Kinghorn: where is my magnifying glass
[3:32:50] gsting: managed to get the fallen charger mount last night
[3:32:56] chainschall: Probably why it hasnt come out yet
[3:33:01] RhadigarTV: @DrWraithjr I think Lost Ark is going to find it's audience for sure
[3:33:26] luckfore: its a shame comp stomp is only twice per year
[3:33:27] Electafuzz: I don't play mobile games, but I'm hyped for immortal
[3:33:29] Aquadriel: I dont like it = Failure LUL these idiots
[3:33:30] TheCliffyShow: I don't like it so it's a failure.
[3:33:32] dragothicx: isn't Diablo 4 going with a similar massive talent tree like PoE? If only they would have used D3's talents and runes, that system weas fine for the game
[3:33:35] reggiepowa: maybe they can port it
[3:33:40] Se7enthSinn: is it pay to win???
[3:33:43] codedizle: yeah I would agree
[3:33:49] Shongoshi: isnt immortal going to switch ? I think I heard taht somewhere
[3:33:49] DrWraithjr: Oh I bet they will release a PC client for Immortal
[3:33:53] galleq: does selling copies make it a good game?
[3:33:58] Aquadriel: i tried genshin on my phone.. uninstalled it, it was fucking burning my fingers 10 minutes in LUL
[3:34:03] bakurathewolf: lol
[3:34:13] MikeDbklyn: no doubt about it @RhadigarTV and it will be a big audience imo
[3:34:26] bakurathewolf: is it free to play?
[3:34:29] 3663Sharad: Every mobile game has a P2W thing in it
[3:34:31] Aquadriel: better ask me if water is wet
[3:34:35] RhadigarTV: @MikeDbklyn I've been watching the raids from Lost Ark and they look intense
[3:34:45] Kinghorn: is this mobile game a mobile game?
[3:34:54] Zethor: even wow is p2w these days LUL

[3:35:05] iamviholt: Question: Do you think we get other announcements this week besides the new unannounced survival game?
[3:35:37] codedizle: despite of all the issues blizz has had i still love their games and will always come back
[3:36:08] feelu_: ppl are salty about new game just because there were no wow news xD
[3:36:13] spiked16: id say in 2-3 weeks they will announce 9.2
[3:36:16] TheCliffyShow: The voice of Charlie Brown died by suicide. Another blow to our childhoods.
[3:36:30] Kinghorn: because it should not be the norm
[3:36:32] charizard_main: Nearly everything has a battle pass
[3:36:33] KingRafilon: hard for me to see the difference between a mount in wow and an NFT. its going to get to a point where all tradeable items in games are NFTs
[3:36:37] Kinghorn: dont just fucking roll over and take it
[3:36:43] 3663Sharad: Shadow of Mordor ingame shop shit LUL
[3:36:48] Shongoshi: assassins creed
[3:37:03] Electafuzz: What do you think about the spectral tiger bundle @Towelliee
[3:37:16] Stickly: Development costs have risen this is the only way to sustain these big games with big costs.
[3:37:25] Stickly: one and done payment is over
[3:37:29] Ninjatun4: the thing is if we would not buy from the stores there would not be the stores
[3:37:30] MikeDbklyn: Yes they do.. I can't wait to do all the exploring! I hope you enjoy it @RhadigarTV  :)
[3:37:39] codedizle: I'm to old to worry about that shit anymore LUL I just play the damn thing
[3:37:40] worthyy92: So the lesson is steal? LUL Kappa
[3:37:40] TheCliffyShow: The voice of Charlie Brown died by suicide. Another blow to our childhoods.
[3:37:52] Se7enthSinn: lol
[3:38:05] RhadigarTV: @MikeDbklyn I've been playing the Russian version. I am going to lose my life in these games lol
[3:38:05] 3663Sharad: Whales are enough for companies to make a shop inside the games
[3:38:14] TheCliffyShow: Just saw it on Yahoo.
[3:38:28] TheHardcorian: ESO's store is vile, forced me to stop playing.

[3:41:08] TheCliffyShow: Star Wars is a money making boss. Why do you think Disney bought it.
[3:41:12] Deathraid82: The amount of whales in that game.

[3:42:25] Deathraid82: Wildstar wins my bet.
[3:42:26] TheCliffyShow: I got the water tiger and not ashamed. I get a cool mount, don't have to worry about my sub for 6 months, is cheaper in the end, and frees up my in-game gold for other stuff.
[3:42:33] Deathraid82: Wildstar was good too.
[3:42:34] rizuel23: they changed the intro quests for rift to be more player friendly not too long ago

[3:44:46] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  panda was trying their OCE servers yesterday
[3:44:47] dalaraz: wildstar token :p
[3:44:50] epik__tv: cant believe we pay 3 times to play wow. crazy haha. ultimate cash cow
[3:44:55] dragothicx: New XIV servers to excising data centers is later this year / next year or so
[3:45:04] Deathraid82: dude a wildstar revival would be HYPE
[3:45:15] TheCliffyShow: I respect the Rift people for not giving up, and rolling for as long as they can.
[3:45:24] EdgyMemeBear: Wildstar FeelsBadMan

[3:46:25] MikeDbklyn: BG put all the chips in peeps and not cpus cray
[3:46:41] dalaraz: last time i checked the emulator,you could log in just no mobs and no fighting
[3:46:47] Goose380: @Towelliee I still find copies of Wildstar in my local walmart all the time
[3:46:50] DecayedmiNt: Oh, they will 100%
[3:47:01] RhadigarTV: Wildstar was great at launch
[3:47:03] DrWraithjr: 😡 how dare you play our game
[3:47:05] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you know they're going to shut them off %100
[3:47:10] RhadigarTV: It had the old school grind to it
[3:47:31] rizuel23: the game I wish would have never died was star wars galaxies.  Sony basically ruined that game overnight
[3:47:31] Stickly: Wildstar was just not properly marketed example of a great product that not enough people knew about it
[3:47:31] MOLAR305: i kinda wish they would bring back marvel heroes omega
[3:47:36] RhadigarTV: That's what it is @Towelliee
[3:47:57] athalon: what caused WildStar to die? Like at one point did it fall off? i never played
[3:48:06] athalon: what point*

[3:49:19] Deathraid82: I had a bug about 2 years ago, i couldn't log into my ncsoft account. They couoldn't figure it out. They eventually just told me we don't know. Sorry.

[3:50:56] Electafuzz: the t&e vid was great tho
[3:51:02] 3663Sharad: Maybe a reason for Chris Metzens mental state?
[3:51:20] 3663Sharad: *back in teh day
[3:51:22] Rudric_Ice: not a fan of T&E
[3:51:32] Deathraid82: yep
[3:51:50] Joneeeez: the delay for 9.2 does that actually means that 10.0 expac reveal is delayed to guys?
[3:51:51] Deathraid82: T&E is fantastic.
[3:51:53] Darzetti_: i need to watch hta
[3:52:21] TheCliffyShow: Afrasiabi is a monster for trying to ruin Sylvanas. Also, the other stuff to.
[3:52:22] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee my favorite comments were the people calling it propaganda.
[3:52:24] AgustinN95: wouldn't be the first time
[3:52:46] Heero_Effect: How do I know he isn’t lying though? Like I’m just taking his word on good faith
[3:52:52] Rudric_Ice: ITS funny that ion didnt do shit about it
[3:53:03] P0RTH0S: P0RTH0S subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months, currently on a 88 month streak!

[3:58:25] gumse_dk: I used to play with Alex in Everquest when he was known as Furor Planedefiler, thought he was awesome, read fires of heaven front page everyday.... and then he turns out to be a huge creep :(
[3:58:26] TheCliffyShow: Inb4 the rogue is still there.
[3:58:27] RaegonGaming: The bigest problem I have with the story is how giga mary sue Sylvanas has been
[3:58:52] S1appadabass: leaks? more like wishlists

[3:59:21] Sollice: @TermsHC He wrote the story arc and I guess it was too far down the patch to change it too much
[3:59:22] Molvonos: He really was.
[3:59:42] Molvonos: Him, Tigole, and the others were *massive* pieces of shit.
[3:59:45] 3663Sharad: D:
[4:00:20] TermsHC: @Sollice not saying his story wasn't the problem, they could've course corrected a long time ago, sounds like a huge cope, not against anyone just sounds like a horribly cynical pr messaging attempt
[4:00:50] idenkaz_: 8.3?
[4:00:51] Sollice: Was in August 2018
[4:00:52] Kisswani: prepatch

[4:01:28] blacktalon013: prepatch

[4:03:50] r0b928: Don’t sell yourself short. It’s at least 6.5
[4:04:04] inj0shwetrust: Imagine thats the audio track that starts playing with the 10.0 reveal trailer.
[4:04:07] Sollice: If the Shadowlands story ends in SL its just a wasted oppertunity.
[4:04:14] slayer_warr: true
[4:04:15] duffluv22: Thought the Jailer was titan ++???
[4:04:23] chippydogs: the garrosh cut scene is the best
[4:04:23] inj0shwetrust: And Nzoth had us in a fucked up RIM sleep this whole xpac
[4:04:24] Sollice: They had a FF type of arc they could have implemented
[4:04:27] Heero_Effect: @sollice truth
[4:04:30] 3663Sharad: N'Zoth lost intentionally too... so maybe the Jailor will also?
[4:04:36] Nitemareforu: Wait, What cut scene?
[4:05:03] dalaraz: most weird thing in shadowlands was, "jailers needs sigils since forever,he takes sigils,ok we make new ones"
[4:05:06] Joneeeez: it would be so fun if Shadowlands was just a dream Nzoth created a illusion a scenario of the end of Azeroth I dunno and the old gods are manipulating us somehow hah...
[4:05:14] Rottencoarse: oh @Towelliee  check this news about Lost Ark. Zzav made a video about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bTTLQVKxGU
[4:05:24] Avaciin: Sylvanas will just one shot him like she did the lich king #greatstorywriting
[4:05:24] Coriollis: the tie in with wrath end cinematic was awesome but like the jailer at this point is a cold and distant star

[6:42:02] reggiepowa: that's what acti is doing with CoD and it works
[6:42:07] IianaDRK: tbf overwatch came from failed titan mmo
[6:42:11] TSquadSully: it's always good to diversify and expand
[6:42:13] TheCliffyShow: Also, they had all those Titan assets to do something with.
[6:42:14] spainard15: it will last for another 15 years
[6:42:23] juxoyaboii: WoW rhythm game win?
[6:42:41] Zeke_nl: OW was also massive esport
[6:42:50] trivotix: HoTS was a great game. League is just too strong

[6:43:36] Donswag3: single player RPG, like skyrim
[6:43:44] JRobezzz: A Blizz themed souls like game would be awesome

[6:43:55] Aidler: I try to imagine what version of WoW people will play in 3.000 years onboard a spaceship
[6:44:04] wastecasetv: that would be dope
[6:44:21] TheCliffyShow: Rock N' Roll Racing
[6:44:26] beeneey: @Towelliee you brought the new mount yet?
[6:44:31] ahrs1988: when you boost  your alt to renown 40, does the renown it already has get added? say i have 10 renown, then i get the token to get 40 renown, will i have 50?
[6:44:44] Blah206: Hexen!
[6:44:44] Arcarious: they need to breathe life into HOTS
[6:44:47] JRobezzz: No
[6:44:50] Moronil: that's what I said earlier, a good RPG, awesome combat, graphics, warcraft universe Kreygasm
[6:44:52] JRobezzz: You just go to 40
[6:44:53] Noshpan: Lost Vikings open sandbox game
[6:44:54] phranklyn_zgz: I think it would be really cool to see them bring back starcraft
[6:44:55] assman_ny: @Aidler Probably be physically involved in some way
[6:44:56] rizuel23: @ahrs1988 no it takes you to 40
[6:45:05] ahrs1988: ty!!
[6:45:18] alextheblight: @Blah206 oh hell yeah

[6:45:26] Blah206: @alextheblight you know it
[6:46:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: A survival game can be smaller and still make good money
[6:46:10] XLcoj: Any more announcements this week? or was the mount the second one? i was hoping for immortal release or 9.2 date at least
[6:46:10] turfjitsu: im gonna give it a real good go at it  ive enjoyed them all over the years  overwatch not so much since i play other shooters
[6:46:13] rocketman_56: !yt

[6:46:27] SmokedHog: wow prob saw how good valheim did
[6:46:35] ralecgos: Do you think Microsoft will want Blizzard to revive HotS?
[6:46:39] Blah206: I'm really excited to see what they can do in the survival genre. Genre that is sorely missing polish. Hope they can learn from Valheim and Rust.
[6:46:45] xsveninatorx: if they give me Starcraft meets Star Citizen i'll give them all my money
[6:46:47] magakigr: despite all that's happening with blizzard, their games are always good
[6:46:49] swordart_19: I want overwatch pvp in wow like 6v6 with payload
[6:46:57] swordart_19: and taking points
[6:46:59] Funderik: it just shows the passion for games is still there at blizzard, when a company has that passion only good things can come.
[6:46:59] Aidler: this game will be the first Disney-Blizzard game
[6:46:59] DishChi: is it ww monk? How will it be in 9.2?
[6:47:01] JRobezzz: I think a lot of people believe that if a game doesn't have millions of players it is a failure. These games can make plenty of money and be amazing even if they aren't as popular as Warzone or FF14, etc.
[6:47:07] SmokedHog: I think blizz is going to make a better version of valheim
[6:47:12] luckfore: trust in our chad overlord mike ybara
[6:47:35] Myndjestyr: goofy ah chungeh.
[6:47:35] Aidler: oh damn.. I mean MS-Blizzard
[6:48:09] Majeure: even if a game DOES have millions of players it's a dead game according to people
[6:48:15] SmokedHog: wow minesweeper inc
[6:48:25] SmokedHog: ultimate stakes minesweeper survival mmo
[6:48:29] Upsides: whats the point of farming comp stomp?
[6:48:40] Motraxtv: out of combat
[6:48:43] Funderik: @Norgrin_ 10.0 been in the works for a while, microsoft will have impact on 11.0,
[6:49:09] cokezro: its still in
[6:49:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: RNG
[6:49:16] herraticc: It’s there
[6:49:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those touch of death powers are crazy yeah
[6:49:59] Nokterian: Resto Shaman in torghast is a cake walk
[6:50:28] AlphasaurusRexx: but also dreadful if you dont get healing rain power early
[6:50:38] jerexify: I didn't think the souls quest gave a renown.
[6:51:21] Funderik: well ye ofc
[6:52:01] DecayedmiNt: Company makes enough money for them to not care about changing anything outside of supporting
[6:52:04] Mwerty: !yt

[6:52:06] gold9871: WB give to 79
[6:52:08] zenothebambino: I made a dh 2 weeks ago and my first necro calling gave me the egg. I just sat there and giggled to myself vrtKEK
[6:52:10] Corwex: people thinking MS will micro manage everything is just..
[6:52:13] swordart_19: More devs always POGGERS
[6:52:45] xsveninatorx: now there's another group with a vested interest in the game's continued success
[6:53:14] Aidler: @corwex but they never did that in the past
[6:53:31] xsveninatorx: even if the acquisition by microsoft only maintains current player counts, they'll see ROI
[6:53:42] cipusanx: wish all reps were account wide
[6:54:09] ralecgos: FFXIV let's you play all the Jobs on one character and that game is doing great. Why don't they just bite the bullet and let us have that in WoW for alts already :/
[6:54:34] Nokterian: big bug
[6:54:40] Nokterian: he eaten
[6:55:23] trivotix: That took me the longest
[6:55:24] Aidler: apparently people in China also got the spectral tiger with their 6 month sub naguuraWut

[6:57:35] roflpotamus: wait what?
[6:57:36] Templexx: aka everyone has it now lol
[6:57:53] ralecgos: I don't think they ever really got the chance to buy the TCG cards so doesn't it kind of make sense for them?
[6:57:58] roflpotamus: you can buy spectral in china now? lol
[6:58:00] wpprrz: Thats not happening
[6:58:08] Motraxtv: People are betting on that for EU and NA too. Like the tbc/wrath merge after wrath is done
[6:58:32] swordart_19: never
[6:58:44] Kneckt: Kneckt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! Hammers up
[6:59:08] ijuki: Is blizzard even in charge of WoW in China?
[6:59:10] Aidler: that's why they can never merge regions with China
[6:59:20] shimwood: They should make a Spectral Tiger statue and sell it in the Blizz Store Kappa
[6:59:22] Sacura_Shadow: its like how gw2 in china has a vip sub over there
[6:59:24] Motraxtv: Not the mount a merge retail account and now tbc later wotlk account
[6:59:27] DecayedmiNt: @ijuki They have to go 3rd party.

[6:59:41] ijuki: @Mint_Fanatic Right, thanks
[6:59:45] Funderik: makes me laugh that people think it's blizzard that did the spectral tiger in china wow.
[7:00:04] Karn1987: @Towelliee the tcg cards didn't work in china at the time of that mount
[7:00:25] Kneckt: @towelliee love the production of your newer YouTube vids, really enjoyed watching them since haven’t had time to watch much live
[7:00:48] Aidler: lot of companies do special things for China

[7:05:02] DecayedmiNt: @Kneckt Oh, apparently china changed to monthly. Taiwan and the rest might still be hourly.
[7:05:13] balanira: do we know that there is no mini 9.2.5 ?
[7:05:20] Aidler: snare and stun won't go away. since mob's can no longer demount they need another way to stop or slow players
[7:05:24] Alexkayzz: 'Dem Shadowlands mofos complaining about some anima drought, meanwhile we've been going through droughts for 17 yrs now KEKW

[7:06:18] DecayedmiNt: @Kneckt It was originally hourly due to how the gaming culture over there was internet cafe gaming.
[7:06:44] cipusanx: anyone missing old combat numbers?
[7:06:54] Kneckt: @mint_fanatic ah that makes sense, learn something new everyday lol
[7:07:10] Densetsu_: Can't we just wait 1,5 years for a new expansion, so they have time to make more conent to be ready, so the droughts isnt that long.

[7:11:26] jamarky23: And then you have SL
[7:11:39] ShadowDMG6969: towLets towGo
[7:11:50] caulpnrydc: I miss swapping between HoF/Vaults, or BoT/BWD/TotFW in cata
[7:11:53] geokouts: finally 80 renown :)
[7:11:53] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:11:56] smashwow: TV is a dead key
[7:11:57] Aidler: how does a RWF work with several parallel raids?
[7:12:03] OnePlayerPete: Ah, so quality and quantity is going down.
[7:12:06] KythosMeltdown: dungeons needing to be designed around m+ is too constraining to make good content
[7:12:15] Alexkayzz: I meaaaan, motherlode was kinda randomish
[7:12:22] Keysern: 5 raids and 20 dungeons. 15 BG's   20 arenas.   5 epiq bg's     would be neat
[7:12:23] JRobezzz: I wouldn't mind more added in throughout the expansion, even if they are smaller
[7:12:26] cbiskit89: do you think they would split raids like MoP tier 1 again? it seems hard to enforce who the "last bosses" are if you can skip entire wings unless they make some kind of attunement to block the final boss
[7:12:27] jeffnsteff2019: i enjoyed those DS dungeons back in Cata with purple gear drops
[7:12:30] JRobezzz: Something to keep it more fresh
[7:12:42] cbiskit89: and they seem against attunements
[7:12:50] jamarky23: @Keysern Word, microsoft could make it happen copium
[7:12:51] grandmatb: nothing was better imo than the begining of legion... Kara dropping SO fast after launch... it was just a great expansion launch
[7:13:07] lithium364: :(
[7:13:23] Cosmolus: then it's when all went to hell Copium
[7:13:33] flebbooo: August 30th i think
[7:13:34] sarbapowa: august 2016
[7:13:36] jamarky23: Not to mention we had so much content in suramar itself plus world quests was new
[7:13:37] IianaDRK: august 26th or something
[7:13:37] surpriseparty20: I just want some mini raids like onyxia . Like why does everyraid has to be big and important story wise
[7:13:41] Radekke: So will we meet dragons or not? :D
[7:13:51] jeffnsteff2019: it only had 3 fights so it would drop quicker
[7:14:17] rilsolo: do you think ToV only happened because how quick emerald nightmare happened?
[7:14:22] ShadowDMG6969: they managed to release so much Content in the time it takes other games just to make fixes
[7:14:27] Densetsu_: Legion had a pretty good pace with content, it should be like that for every expansion.
[7:14:40] Yagr6: legion was amazing BibleThump
[7:14:53] Alexkayzz: Meanwhile in SL, in 5 months we got 3 blue posts KEKW
[7:15:01] Cosmolus: KEKW
[7:15:02] luckfore: and 6 months later ToS and then 6 months later Antorus
[7:15:02] jeffnsteff2019: legion was a great era in wow history
[7:15:03] luckfore: it was so good
[7:15:07] grandmatb: Legion dropped August 30th (so basically begining of September).. and ToV/Kara was Oct 25th
[7:15:15] KythosMeltdown: m+ sucks tho
[7:15:19] Sacura_Shadow: that was when i started and omg it was so good
[7:15:25] jamarky23: Shit to do constantly and also outside of PvE side of things
[7:15:28] NolungsTV: sup @Towelliee what u up on SL now just 9.2 prep?
[7:15:37] codedizle: rip discord
[7:15:41] KrimsonElite: i miss legion
[7:15:44] Sacura_Shadow: like story for each class was freaking awesome
[7:15:46] rilsolo: and artifact weapon lvls? if you had to play more than one spec
[7:15:48] luckfore: It was so cool to do the class hall on every class and get the weapon skins
[7:15:56] Graviits: But you have to admit, when a legendary dropped in Legion you just felt the hype
[7:15:58] ParzTV81: @towelliee any chance we get a 9.2 announcement this week?
[7:15:59] Cosmolus: True!
[7:16:00] eyeztea: having to farm power for all different specs wasnt the best but yeah legion was amazing
[7:16:00] TSquadSully: i really miss legion
[7:16:00] jeffnsteff2019: if they stick to simples and go away from borrowed powers we be OK
[7:16:07] assman_ny: My new main was born in Legion.  I really never got bored with Legion
[7:16:11] Cosmolus: Facts Clap
[7:16:14] jamarky23: Huge problem in FF14 imo
[7:16:15] KILLJOY4455: @Towelliee it would be cool in dragon isle if the last raid was galakrond resurrected or in the process of we going inside him and he is quite literally the raid
[7:16:15] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[7:16:22] ShadowDMG6969: WoW made it possible to actually enjoy going thru stuff multiple times
[7:16:23] ijuki: @poohonshoe What main was taht?
[7:16:26] ijuki: that*
[7:16:26] lithium364: Legion the beginning of the Decade of the SPEAR
[7:16:31] KythosMeltdown: yeah
[7:16:33] KILLJOY4455: we Go*
[7:16:35] Alexkayzz: Guess FF fixed that too with roulletes
[7:16:37] ralecgos: I hope wow fixes the fact old raids are pointless too
[7:16:40] KythosMeltdown: ESO dungeons all scale to max level veteran modes
[7:16:55] Spoopyfoop: all dungeons in ESO have a veteran version
[7:17:01] jeffnsteff2019: Notice how questing each zone leads to a dungeon quest for end zone since Legion
[7:17:02] ShadowDMG6969: in ESO it's better to run the Vet difficulty then the regular Dungeons
[7:17:06] assman_ny: My DH @ijuki I just had a lot of fun in that one
[7:17:13] flebbooo: Big true, m+ was revolutionary. Its sad it gets shit on now
[7:17:16] aminus: Yeah you do in ESO for set bonuses
[7:17:18] ijuki: @poohonshoe Great SeemsGood
[7:17:20] jamarky23: I wish that FF14 had that tbh
[7:17:31] Bigvont: roulette in FFXIV can get you to any dungeon (its like daily dungeon thing)
[7:17:32] KythosMeltdown: m+ requires dungeons to be constrained to a certain design. thats why I say it "sucks"
[7:17:32] kekdubbb: It would make more sense if they let you upgrade yoru current gear as the expansion progresses, instead of having to refarm it because item level went up

[7:17:54] jamarky23: @Bigvont Yeah but its still nothing near like wow mythics
[7:17:57] alextheblight: indeed
[7:17:58] ShadowDMG6969: it's not a huge change cause the only difference s thay you have a higher chance of Legendary rarity & Epic rarity gear sets
[7:18:10] Bulletpunchs: sorry just tuned, thoughts on the new store mount?
[7:18:14] aminus: M+ needs to be treated as it’s own entity rather than just a second rate pve activity
[7:18:27] codedizle: yeah but imo ffxiv just isnt that game and lots of people fun dungeons in ffxiv over and over for glam
[7:18:29] Alexkayzz: M+ for raids when? Kappa
[7:18:52] codedizle: but yeah m+ is nice I like it
[7:19:03] KythosMeltdown: M+ showed us people don't wanna do a dungeon like Halls of Odyn or whatever it was called that takes 2x the time as Maw of Souls
[7:19:09] tekdubya: 8.3 affix was amazing
[7:19:13] Colt_Engineer: BRO
[7:19:13] ShadowDMG6969: that'd make things interesting
[7:19:16] sil3nt48: @Towelliee youre a tough one bro
[7:19:22] luckfore: thats some copium bro
[7:19:27] ralecgos: I'm excited for Timewalking to get more and more expansive
[7:19:30] Winpimplaren: Speedrun Mythic Raids LULW
[7:19:32] mavericks312: that is way to much tuning then blizz can handle imo
[7:19:34] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  isnt liquid and echo doing a thing with the current riad with mythic+ affixes ?? :D
[7:19:38] grapyz: Ive heard many time about how the vaults shouldnt 100% be rng. whats your take on this
[7:19:48] EvilMrMcNasty: been thinking about getting back into WoW but still not sure if it will ever be fun again
[7:20:04] Moronil: monkaS ?
[7:20:11] xFevers: Max said blindfolded tanks
[7:20:14] InsaneToons: no legos for a boss lol
[7:20:16] xFevers: No dom shards
[7:20:23] xFevers: RP walking,etc..
[7:20:25] luckfore: that would be so cool tho
[7:20:25] Motraxtv: just greengear would be fun :)
[7:20:30] grapyz: Every 10 sec you have to walk 2 sec lol
[7:20:33] Aidler: you can do no damage Kappa
[7:20:36] JansonLives: Max mentioned the affixes should be announced soonish.
[7:20:47] mavericks312: yea getting mastery and vers gear as a frost mage is stupid
[7:20:52] notemneiher: i have 252 legs and lego cloak equipped, last two weeks I got 252 legs and cloak from vault
[7:20:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: An algorithm to make it a smart vault could fix it, yeah
[7:21:04] ShadowDMG6969: My friend got 5 pairs of 260 pants
[7:21:07] dugarg_: Just look at the lowest ilvl item and prioritize that?
[7:21:14] ShadowDMG6969: they weren't very happy
[7:21:17] smashwow: or boots @Towelliee
[7:21:23] AlphasaurusRexx: renown 52
[7:21:28] JansonLives: OMG that stupid council trinket. I got that so many times.
[7:21:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: If the vault gives you an item you want, it's great
[7:21:41] Yagr6: wait till they make a lever on the vault and it spins like slots
[7:21:45] Warjun11: is dragonmire real?
[7:21:56] ShadowDMG6969: 100%
[7:21:57] gali5656: for sure
[7:22:10] Motraxtv: big ture on that
[7:22:15] luckfore: vault is better but chest was more exciting
[7:22:17] EthicalHermit: I want a defer system for the vault, for one piece
[7:22:20] gali5656: got the same bracers back to back weeks back in bfa, made me quit for a few months
[7:22:28] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towelliee, which WOW expansion was "objectively" the best according to you?
[7:22:29] Pisteroni: maybe if you have an item level in that slot give an option to reroll that vault slot?
[7:22:29] sarbapowa: wait so what is the difference between bfa weekly chest and sl vault? @Towelliee
[7:22:33] dwolf010: do you expect a new announcement this week or next week? because we they are not done with announcing
[7:22:47] JRobezzz: Vault is way better than just the chest
[7:22:52] Tcrane_: or a pog item, buuuut corruption xD
[7:23:08] smashwow: idk. seeing myself getting fucked 3 times vs 1 is still me getting fucked
[7:23:14] zaechil: So i'm farming Comp Stomp, and fyi, did 43-45, 45-46, 46-48. so... random.
[7:23:17] jeffnsteff2019: i didnt like end patch for BFA
[7:23:21] Aidler: agree. the vault is better if it offers a choice and not only cloaks or boots
[7:23:22] KythosMeltdown: only needing to do 1 m+ was nice 8)
[7:23:25] Throkkz: Just make the vault let you choose whichever piece
[7:23:29] CrunkyBrewster: deleted
[7:23:31] Duffadin: vault is better, but still mean without some better AI behind it.
[7:23:32] KythosMeltdown: granted you can still jsut do one now haha
[7:23:37] sarbapowa: necro
[7:23:39] Lucium22: necro
[7:23:40] Colt_Engineer: venth
[7:23:40] eyeztea: venth
[7:23:40] Donswag3: necro
[7:23:43] AlphasaurusRexx: venth
[7:23:44] wpprrz: vcenthyr
[7:23:44] yadungoofed101: i did 6 comp stomps in a row and only got 1 renown lol
[7:23:47] IianaDRK: necro 100%
[7:23:50] xFevers: Necro or Vent
[7:23:55] jeffnsteff2019: i just thought visions and dailies were bland
[7:23:57] balanira: all of them work tbh
[7:23:58] Alexkayzz: Feels like venth and necro are literally 50 / 50 or 49 / 51
[7:24:01] Funderik: no sane person would say the bfa chest was better then the current vault
[7:24:01] Moronil: furry 100%
[7:24:03] IianaDRK: having an extra defensive and a second mass grip is op af
[7:24:03] chavodk: all of them are good
[7:24:09] AlphasaurusRexx: necro good for sanguine weeks and pvp. venth good everywhere else
[7:24:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kyrian is pretty good but all are viable....I run Venthyr on my Blood, but Necro can work too and even Night Fae is alright
[7:24:16] rohdey: they said venthyr was best for dungeons
[7:24:18] sarbapowa: abomination limb is great
[7:24:25] balanira: i play frost and unholy so i went necro but for only blood does not matter
[7:24:35] KythosMeltdown: venthyr blood jsut makes the most sense haha
[7:24:42] IianaDRK: its sooo gooooos
[7:24:44] IianaDRK: gooood
[7:24:47] ShadowDMG6969: Blood DKs have alot of options with Covenant honestly
[7:25:06] AlphasaurusRexx: venth synergizes with bonestorm really well
[7:25:08] Bayne77: It literally slaps Kappa
[7:25:13] sarbapowa: if u only do m+ u go vent I think but if u raid, pvp and do m+ u go necro and u slap
[7:25:34] JansonLives: abom + freezing add on 2nd boss of mists = Lol
[7:25:39] balanira: yeah if you want to play bonestorm u should go venthyr

[7:25:42] IianaDRK: raiding only with fights with lots of adds
[7:25:49] AlphasaurusRexx: prob not raid, but m+ its big healing
[7:25:51] IianaDRK: single boss u use red thirst
[7:26:07] smashwow: if you don't need slapping hands, venth or kyrian is the next best choice for raiding
[7:26:11] dugarg_: I just joined a comp stomp and we've got 8 healers
[7:26:13] hspep: it auto takes
[7:26:28] sgtalash: zandalar

[7:27:11] OldManChickenLegs: Shameless
[7:27:18] luckfore: thats some Abyss worm kind of luck
[7:27:20] sarbapowa: I think u get renown from bg, no?

[7:29:10] TheUnknowing: you can adjust it from there xD
[7:29:11] IianaDRK: i did mythic raiding as belf. having on demand runic power is really useful
[7:29:13] Havoc_S1: Panda
[7:29:14] IianaDRK: and another dispel
[7:29:15] Scoodles91: go for Tauren, cant go wrong with that for a tank :D

[7:29:40] Orrkkyy: touch of the grave does quite a bit of dmg
[7:29:41] IianaDRK: touch of the grave i guess
[7:29:42] Motraxtv: Touch of the grave
[7:29:47] Gruffian: Nothing, its like 2 DPS difference
[7:29:50] ralecgos: oh yeah touch of the grave i mean
[7:30:06] jammingz: @Towelliee planning to maybe come back to wow, u think I should wait till 9.2?
[7:30:07] sarbapowa: undead just looks sick
[7:30:13] Holysal: just play what you want imo
[7:30:13] balanira: everyone goes goblin for mobilty since DK
[7:30:18] IianaDRK: theres realistically no noticable difference between the races. its more their racial utility
[7:30:20] rohdey: ancestors call i think
[7:30:22] TheUnknowing: maghar racial gives stats right?
[7:30:39] dugarg_: secondary stats
[7:30:41] luckfore: LUL

[7:31:08] Dinosew: I would say High Mountain for the vers
[7:31:16] TheUnknowing: but really doesn't matter tbh, play whatever race you want xD
[7:31:44] xmedpakx: undead or orc look sick as Deathknight
[7:32:11] Gruffian: I like Vulpera for keys. Nose for trouble is sneaky good.
