[2:46:46] bubbles1489: Morning
[2:47:09] TheGiant99: why release 10.1 anywhere near D4 at all
[2:47:15] Wulfgrym: early may makes sense
[2:47:16] paradoxyy: No shot,its early june ,they are late for sure
[2:47:28] TheFiddlerDiddler: 10.0.7 actually has a lot
[2:47:29] Endin: big for hunters and pallies
[2:47:36] rosina_scarlett: my guess is mid July for 10.1
[2:47:42] Wulfgrym: theres no way they release a wow patch anywhere near diablo 4 release
[2:47:44] TheGiant99: D4 isa gonna rob so many players from wow
[2:47:54] Thoreya: im gonna say late may
[2:47:55] GingerGambit: 10.0.7 “should” tell us next raid right?
[2:48:00] reggiepowa: thats like shadowlands level of drought lol
[2:48:19] GingerGambit: They said 10.1 was said to be spring on the roadmap

[2:49:08] reggiepowa: mid december
[2:49:08] Thoreya: december
[2:49:14] Armdel: you can atleast probably expect D4 and the next raid tier to not release too close to eachother
[2:49:17] biirrd: dec
[2:49:17] reggiepowa: 5 months is ideal imo
[2:49:18] RainAndMyStory: Yo' Towelie. When do you think D4 is actually releasing? Was there a date announced yet?
[2:49:28] iccyc0ld: mmm , I didn't post a link :(

[2:49:31] Brodih_: but Baldurs gate  3 is a bigger release for me towNut3
[2:49:33] Thoreya: so it would be earlier
[2:49:35] rosina_scarlett: @Heero_Effect GTA6 won't be out for another 5 years or so
[2:49:37] instant_savage: theres always a chance blizzard says fuck the players and just releases shit at the same time and says play what u choose
[2:49:43] Rakim88: Falcons released QB Marcus Mariota. The move saved them $12 million agains their salary cap. welp they r going lamar or draft big time
[2:49:54] reggiepowa: there is nothing gear wise in 10.0.7 its only more open world content

[3:12:38] Keyastaron_: trinket inc
[3:12:52] pk99: seed not bad
[3:13:02] reggiepowa: maybe you can catalize it
[3:13:06] reggiepowa: for better stats
[3:13:10] kimmo_gaming: you can catalyst the cloak
[3:13:15] Keyastaron_: ye
[3:13:16] Snabido: Would you look at that - another mount neck 😏
[3:13:19] LookerM1r: You can change the cloak into set and get better stats
[3:13:33] Boggogroggo: it becomes the raid cloack
[3:13:45] kimmo_gaming: you must check what is for paladin, maybe its haste vers lol
[3:13:50] Khooya_: prob the eranog one?
[3:13:58] Boggogroggo: check the adventure log
[3:13:59] Attackroot: Tier cloak not sure the stats
[3:14:01] DarksUprising: are USA servers up??

[3:14:06] shale93: check the cloak from raid you have there

[3:14:14] Densetsu_: Why can't we see ur mouse? WutFace
[3:14:15] LookerM1r: Cloak is haste mastery

[3:14:18] derry10: its a haste mast clock for paladins
[3:14:23] carmelchaos: the seed towNut1
[3:14:28] neverbornlucky: Towelliee, Asmongold said take it my son and make clickbait videos about it
[3:14:34] Dein95: i don't wanna heal this week :( :(
[3:14:41] atsq1: I have it; always forget to use it
[3:14:46] DrakeDuude: @biirrd na man thats not how raiding works. if u stop trying to gear at any point u get sat for someone who is
[3:14:49] coldarmorTBG: https://www.wowhead.com/item=200422/virtuous-silver-cloak
[3:15:25] gzus81: 20%
[3:15:41] Greybeard_ttv: Fuck that key
[3:15:49] GingerGambit: I got 18 AA………..
[3:15:53] OnceAMoose: dead key
[3:16:13] DarksUprising: Rip is a easy key if you arent stupid lol and @Towelliee  priests have an easy week to heal this week
[3:16:14] dokor: like they always do
[3:16:26] biirrd: remove them and get us posetive ones
[3:16:26] Nokterian: these affixes not making me heal at all
[3:16:27] Voltaictv: Complete Affix rework is well overdue
[3:16:31] Nokterian: fuck that
[3:16:41] neverbornlucky: no towelliee Lets nerf healers and then buff warlocks again
[3:17:04] DarksUprising: dont need a healer if you avoid dmg :P
[3:17:33] thecynicalshuffler: i wish they would get rid of them. the affixes dont seem to bring any fun to the m+ just make hard and frustrating for artificial difficulty sake
[3:17:45] Djfarmville: did i miss box opening?
[3:17:46] rosina_scarlett: @DarksUprising you can't avoid bursting :P
[3:17:54] biirrd: i will just run my +16 this week to get my 418 gear
[3:18:11] Sollice: tornado one is stupid if they still have that
[3:18:12] Endin: as a healer I totally skip this week. period.
[3:18:12] Boggogroggo: they need to come up with some better affixes
[3:18:15] derry10: i would be happy if Grevious left
[3:18:19] Boggogroggo: make things more interesting
[3:18:26] johniiv: They don't have to go. They need to modify them to 'boost' and not punish
[3:18:51] DovethAboveth: Positive affixes would be cool
[3:18:54] sdpercussion: there's never been a fix that people don't complain about
[3:18:55] zzues: Well trash once again in my vault. Time to unsub I think, so bored with the constant disappointment and frustration that is wow these days.
[3:18:55] pk99: There's so few affixes now because they are surprising us season 2  FeelsStrongMan
[3:18:58] Djfarmville: M+ turns into challenge modes
[3:19:00] johniiv: As example Explosives should be. Destroying an explosive should give the player who destroy it x% haste for x sec
[3:19:08] sephronz: maybe give the option to choose affixed but get bonuses for choosing weekly ones
[3:19:11] Gajing: What if they did a season of all the previous seasonal affixes
[3:19:15] Greybeard_ttv: Yeah having one that helps and one that hurts maybe?
[3:19:15] Dcarter: im so sick of fort and tyran
[3:19:19] LovingR: end of season soon ?
[3:19:20] biirrd: they need to be kiss/curse... ex kill the explosive an get a 5-10 dps/healing burst
[3:19:27] johniiv: Quaking should be stacking all together grant an earth absorption shield for x stack. max 5 stack
[3:19:28] ElmSpace: buff affixes each week to change how your class played might be interesting for a season or 2
[3:19:46] itshighrisktv: i think there should just be one affix, and then just randomize where everything spawns in the dungeon, even the bosses can be in other bosses spots
[3:20:02] sdpercussion: no
[3:20:04] zzues: If you give the party a buff then no one will kill explosives, because they will wait for others to do it so their dps is higher
[3:20:07] Greybeard_ttv: This seasonal affix was so dumb lol
[3:20:08] Squid1030: this seasonal affix is ass
[3:20:10] sdpercussion: you have to plan CDs around routes
[3:20:11] Masqerader: or have it put a dot on the enemy
[3:20:12] Djfarmville: I would pref if the explosives didnt hit that hard so its not the end of the world if one goes off
[3:20:17] sdpercussion: you cant randomize
[3:20:22] DrakeDuude: as a warlock fuck explosives week. were basiclly useless as demo
[3:20:39] Roughneck124: What if you get rid of explosives, you get HP depending on how many you take out.
[3:21:01] Sollice: I think any affect that so affects play style for ranged or melee should be removed. It just doesnt feel good to have to completely stop casing or constantly move in or out or anything like that
[3:21:09] OnceAMoose: You can drag him up and tank him on the unfrozen ground.
[3:21:20] sdpercussion: If you remove affixes all you're left with is hp/dmg scaling. Then keys are completely scripted and you just hit a wall when the scaling produces one-shots or impossible timers

[3:21:37] WildTree_NA: WildTreeNa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:21:38] Masqerader: make it a apply a dot to enemies to increase their damage taken
[3:21:57] axellent_x: They need to be more creative with it, go beyond something just kills you faster if ignored
[3:22:01] reggiepowa: yeah thats true, season would become stale faster
[3:22:06] Djfarmville: Back to challenge mode days LUL
[3:22:07] Masqerader: it already has a wall
[3:22:11] GingerGambit: I mean there’s still walls and one shots at high enough keys?
[3:22:17] bearlicioussss: Or if you destroy an explosive it’ll do a little aoe damage to your enemies
[3:22:18] Dcarter: NO
[3:22:19] sdpercussion: no
[3:22:20] Dcarter: FUCK NO
[3:22:21] Dcarter: HELL NO
[3:22:21] GingerGambit: That doesn’t change anything
[3:22:22] sdpercussion: the other affixes do
[3:22:23] reggiepowa: I think they do
[3:22:29] neverbornlucky: towelliee we can not have it become like that otherwise our servers couldn't handle the people playing. You saw what happen to diablo3
[3:22:29] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:22:36] Dcarter: fort and tyran are awful
[3:22:43] biirrd: at best you love BL around
[3:22:46] biirrd: move
[3:22:50] Boggogroggo: they should have stuff like invasion from PoE
[3:22:58] xHukk: @Towelliee  are you suggesting mythic plus with no affixes?  or you have an alternate idea you think they should implement?
[3:23:00] dreamwalker213: It still gets stale fast with the current system
[3:23:06] sdpercussion: @Towelliee The other affixes make it dynamic. Tyr/Fort would just create a hard wall that you'd hit
[3:23:09] Masqerader: the only health and damage modifier should be on the key itself and nothing else imo  fort/tryrannical are ass
[3:23:12] RageerPLZ: I dont' like fort becuase of pugs, Not enough people know the mechanics of invidual mobs, become so, so so so so much more important on fort week, but so many people do not kick/interupt.
[3:23:20] Boggogroggo: spawn a second boss at last boss fight, get double loot
[3:23:21] RageerPLZ: as a tank tyran week is my favorite week
[3:23:28] Exodeo_: I'm avoiding keys :p just doing lowbie ones on my alts
[3:23:37] Dcarter: theres still a wall
[3:23:39] iccyc0ld: Same like D3
[3:23:42] xHukk: so instead of pushing 20+ they push 40+
[3:23:56] Wulfgrym: you know what is stale, sitting in town for 2 hours looking for a healer.
[3:23:56] Inthezonewow: Sounds like a guide on how to take a towWipe
[3:24:02] sdpercussion: kiss/curse is interesting tho.
[3:24:08] zytrix90: Are the new trading post items out yet?
[3:24:13] st_cynical_one: affixes for cosmetic stuff?
[3:24:20] TakeThatBack: I just dont like how I feel Forced to do M+ if I want to seriously raid
[3:24:27] iccyc0ld: Monthly right
[3:24:31] EdgeOfTwilight: it should be tomorrow
[3:24:36] vflynn: g
[3:24:38] WhatYeti: Tomorrow, I think the things in the post say 23 hours left
[3:24:39] raldrik: I feel like they need a version of the original tourgast that combines aspects of Diablo and infinite scaling. Add a leaderboard and you have recuring content.
[3:24:40] reggiepowa: what is there to say, it's every 1st
[3:24:43] Masqerader: bring back awakening or encrypted lol
[3:24:43] shale93: it should be tomorrow,
[3:24:48] vflynn: lol
[3:24:49] Greybeard_ttv: Should say on the journal thing
[3:24:56] shale93: last one was feb 1st
[3:24:58] sdpercussion: "gain 5% stacking haste for each interrupted cast" - Everyone would become a better player in like 2 weeks
[3:24:58] Dcarter: i pug heroic raz every week
[3:25:01] EdgeOfTwilight: they said it reset at the beginning of the month
[3:25:01] Dcarter: thats pain
[3:25:04] iccyc0ld: LFR is fun
[3:25:16] windexrob32: The reason that one works for me is because seasonal affix can give you some benefit not just worthlessness
[3:25:26] axellent_x: Maybe if an explosive pops the group gets a -5% dmg debuff or a small heal absorb, instead of outright kills you
[3:25:31] windexrob32: Other affixes are just a waste of time

[3:27:25] Doohzyy: clearing thundering during quaking KEKW
[3:27:31] DovethAboveth: Fortified and tyran just aren’t creative imo
[3:27:38] GingerGambit: Choosing to quake your team or getting stunned from thundering is awful
[3:27:39] reggiepowa: growl has best takes about m+
[3:28:07] RageerPLZ: Hp damage scaling is fine, but it should always be a thing, not 1 week bosses 1 week mobs, this way people know every week, hey maybe I should stun this pack, cause I know last week this 1 spell 1 shot me, Repetitiveness, helps build better players.
[3:28:21] Aubue: Is Thundering make everything worse?
[3:28:21] Thoreya: id rather have tyran and fort, and have them redo other affixes
[3:28:23] DrakeDuude: 7 years of tyr and fort
[3:28:28] DovethAboveth: Oh yeah, but that was fuckin 7 years ago lmao
[3:28:55] Heero_Effect: Thundering was meh
[3:28:59] zzues: I have never liked M+, hate timed dungeons
[3:29:33] Mecabeast: They shoulda made thundering clear early for the buff not clear late
[3:29:36] Masqerader: @zzues fun fact u don't need to time it, there are lots of people who do them and ignore the timer
[3:29:39] OhNoNotAgain: I think my biggest problem with Tyr and Fort is that it takes them a whole week if not more of it to nerf things and balance it out.
[3:29:39] zzues: Deadmines
[3:29:48] axellent_x: Here's an affix, the trees temple are larger and now block your vision more
[3:29:51] sdpercussion: @zzues ya but without a timer, you could wait for lust constantly
[3:29:55] zzues: :)
[3:29:57] Heero_Effect: They should do torghast for solo players to get 415 gear :)
[3:29:57] CeruleanStar: yeah DM
[3:29:59] windexrob32: Problem is every affix is designed to make healing awful. Never is it really a "good" week to be a healer lol
[3:30:24] neverbornlucky: blizzard Towelliee wants a Free Hold mythic + seasonal

[3:35:33] Maligus: that would be a hard yes
[3:35:40] SK1NFATHER: RFK could be good
[3:35:44] Snabido: Gnome KEKW I would like to complete the dungeon before the day's over
[3:35:57] robokall: KFC is better though
[3:35:59] Squidnapped: I just hate most TBC dungeons lol
[3:36:04] DoughBoi_Trev: Razorfen's would be awesome
[3:36:07] Thoreya: crypts and tombs would prob work the best
[3:36:11] Thoreya: for m+
[3:36:19] Herzenliegen: bot would be bad
[3:36:26] Heero_Effect: TBC had alot of dungeons
[3:36:49] lorddrekken: did you open your vaults yet?
[3:37:12] WhatYeti: Legion had a lot of Dungeons cuz M+ came out
[3:37:13] DoughBoi_Trev: Maybe I'll get through these ads and be back. Who knows , it's an abyss like towels hunts beefyb10Eyes1 beefyb10Eyes2
[3:37:29] Heero_Effect: Yeah just crazy, I didn’t realize how much less they started to make
[3:37:33] Masqerader: #bringbackFREEHOLD
[3:37:37] Greybeard_ttv: I imagine because 10.1 is supposed to be about the underground I bet we get Deepholm and Neltharins lair next season and shadow pan mon just to troll us
[3:37:57] robokall: glad thats over
[3:37:59] OhNoNotAgain: OhNoNotAgain gifted a Tier 1 sub to DoughBoi_Trev! They have given 480 Gift Subs in the channel!

[3:38:37] Snabido: Them pelters tho
[3:38:54] Inthezonewow: I don't feel keen doing any M+ versions of any dungeon thats currently in the Timewalking pool
[3:39:08] neverbornlucky: Towelliee you know you want the other side mythic +
[3:39:10] Masqerader: shadopan with those little mobs that need to be interrupted ain't no one finishing that shit
[3:39:17] Keyastaron_: oh yea
[3:39:24] Voltaictv: The worst DF one next season is Halls 100%, people dont even know. Just think about the boss fights
[3:39:31] RocketMan23: except without m+ the replayability of those dungeons would be nonexistent
[3:39:34] Skriz: Yes
[3:39:40] chopsaki: less dungeons.. quicker burnout they get boring runing same thing over and over
[3:39:50] Thoreya: ya but who wants to do heroic dungeons
[3:39:51] rbolude: They definitely gotta spend more time on each dungeon nowdays
[3:39:56] stabzmcgeee: we would have more dungeons but we would do way less
[3:40:07] sdpercussion: I'm watching streamers do 23's with 4 dps and no healer. Maybe the problem is that people will always be unhappy
[3:40:21] DoughBoi_Trev: Wouldn't be as bad if they created different affixes tbh. Not like 1 affix per xpac

[3:42:17] Thoreya: i actually dig this season a lot so ive been enjoying it, specs feel fun too for dps
[3:42:18] DovethAboveth: I picked the wrong season to push for title lol
[3:42:39] freakwidit: Do you think its cause you went so hard early on ?
[3:43:05] Squidnapped: I have like over 500 done lol
[3:43:26] Dcarter: wheres my personal SP at for my PI
[3:43:43] SkymasterLz: if you Shift+click on you number and paste on the wow chat you will see it in full @Towelliee

[3:44:13] xHukk: I ran a 17 last night and acquired the 9 pts I needed to be exactly 2400.  Not sure I'm going to push for any more score.  lol
[3:44:22] DovethAboveth: Cause he plays with people who have a similar mindset and generally only those people
[3:44:23] thecreatorhimself: I have the juiciest of butts. None of you can compare.
[3:44:25] adam6683: Ya I’ve just been leveling alts and pvp. I’m over m+
[3:44:30] SicDogg: hey Lula
[3:44:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: "The elements answer to meee!" over and over and over

[3:45:24] Exodeo_: I also just don't enjoy the DF m+ dungeons atm
[3:45:30] cmitchell042092: Legion still the best imo
[3:45:35] Gitmm: Affixes need an overhaul
[3:45:49] sdpercussion: M+ is more dynamic, like jazz music. Whereas M raiding is like an orchestral arrangement. The pacing just feels different. Most people prefer one over the other
[3:45:50] Thoreya: bfa is my fav so far
[3:45:51] Frosty1u1: i think next season we will see some big quality of life m+ changes
[3:45:56] Thoreya: then folowed by s1 of this expansion
[3:45:57] kaosss08: I really loved Legion, lore wise and class hall stuff.
[3:46:06] Frosty1u1: imo a big one would be keys under 20 dont deplete so its less stressful for pugs
[3:46:14] FresheFefe: did somebody say Azerite.....CHAMPIOOON!

[3:47:03] peinen: it's almost like they should have done a massive M+ pass going into DF
[3:47:05] DovethAboveth: First boss of brackenhide is gonna eat people’s souls
[3:47:09] Dcarter: but be worse season we have ever had

[3:56:05] stabzmcgeee: he might be new and doesnt know any better
[3:56:12] cmitchell042092: Probably just decided today was the day to try tanking
[3:56:13] johniiv: The worst part was that he was a Tank. Worst thing to be when you start
[3:56:16] BoogiePonderosa: they were playing with paper and dice too
[3:56:18] Greybeard_ttv: Best thing was he stopped at 9 to answer his mom lol
[3:56:24] TheGiant99: I wanna play wow but there is nothing really left for me to do.....I geared to the level I want and not into high end sweaty stuff

[3:56:54] stabzmcgeee: in literally the entry level content and yall are flaming him,
[3:56:58] hurdy11: LFR tanking basically just requires DBM/BigWigs and  a 5 minute youtube video
[3:57:03] opalwinfrey: @TheGiant99 collect mounts, pets, tmog, old raids, there is ton to do

[3:57:09] RoamingRedPanda: they just that 'type' of person?
[3:57:10] LuiBMHunter: @thegiant99 same here - so I'm levelling allts and doing lfr on them
[3:57:12] QlecGaming: so how about teaching him then instead of kicking him?
[3:57:14] Wulfgrym: he didn't want to tank, he wanted to type, bet he doesn't even know the timer is in game
[3:57:31] TheGiant99: @TizTriickz i dont need any of that stuff
[3:57:49] NotEnoughMana: he probably thinks all the other tanks type that shit out too
[3:57:54] TheGiant99: @LuiBMHunter did that already also
[3:57:59] Wulfgrym: teaching requires a receptive student
[3:58:17] cmitchell042092: Reminds me of my first time playing WoW and I didn’t know what a tank even was. So I just kept running through dungeons attacking shit and getting kicked all the time.
[3:58:18] TheGiant99: I am in the D4 waiting room
[3:58:26] cmitchell042092: I was dps
[3:59:07] mrrazputin: you compare your 420ilvl to 360ilvl dps ?
[3:59:15] Lloydbanksz: thats right enjoy ur main class
[3:59:26] LuiBMHunter: no idea - never seen it happen but guess it's possible
[3:59:43] Wulfgrym: when people play LFR, i think of Sarauman from LOTR, telling Gandalf "you have chosen, the way of pain"
[3:59:53] BoogiePonderosa: airhorns never don't make me laugh.. so this is a good fight
[4:00:11] Armdel: @mrrazputin the point was, if there are people in there able to out dps his 420, they are probably good on damage
[4:00:16] GrandGuy95: thats very true
