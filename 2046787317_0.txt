[4:24:38] Paragore001: Its ok, atleast your UI doesnt look like someone vomited out health bars, cdew kinda sus
[4:24:39] kellydean_: he also doesn't get cloned nonstop
[4:24:41] lazyturtle0824: It’s because Pika is cloned and double disarm
[4:24:44] ceelos23a: the cyclones put pika really behined in dps
[4:24:46] Ultrafocus: how does trill do so much more dmg damn it
[4:24:48] JesusTbyte: @sanatalive KEKW

[4:25:04] Ultrafocus: @ceelos23a oh you're right
[4:25:13] Dungbeatle_DB: !loot
[4:25:19] BoilerRoomTV: usually watch cdew since I like the healer pov for arena. sits outside of everything and you can see things unfold easier. hard swapped to this freak when I saw the matchup and I actually loved rogue pov for that fight. gg.
[4:26:03] eygton: how did he have so much more dmg then you?
[4:26:14] derbs2: @BoilerRoomTV pikas pov has a touch of intensity like no other lol
[4:26:23] snarky03: just got oomed
[4:26:33] Bigpenance: Pikas pov is always great lol
[4:26:44] pmanfit91: Pika is getting cycloned and you can't dispel it. This gives a big advantage on the meters to make it look like Trill is doing more damage. It's just CC.
[4:26:47] eleblastnaga: I think it is just because you are in clone 1/2 the time.
[4:26:51] pmanfit91: For those who keep asking.
[4:26:52] not_bradlington: @bartharious Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:26:56] not_bradlington: wow
