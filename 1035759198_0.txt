[4:22:15] mitchumtx: but yet stadiums will be full of 100s of thousands of fans....okay Blizzard
[4:22:15] zgag: Sounds about right.  Not knowing who is vaccinated (trying to get people to comply with that) and a big venue.

[4:23:20] kokochris: @Birder_L thats what im thinking
[4:23:22] Just_Say_Yo: nah man they will announce 9.2
[4:23:23] mitchumtx: #GiveMeBlizzcon
[4:23:23] Alexkayzz: This way they get more time to release 9.2 before next expac reveal
[4:23:24] FerociouzMonk: mmmmm defile <3

[4:24:07] Affiiance: No Blizzcon announced!
[4:24:09] Lockdown_247: Are they Gina have a online bliz con?
[4:24:23] KillaFin: thar would appreciate players fertilizing his grave for the plant cause that's Uther KEKWDISCO
[4:24:34] kokochris: @Lockdown_247 dont think thats confirmed, but highly likely sometime early next year ?
[4:24:49] rocthenite: i remember a video of a browns fan pissing on art mandel grave
[4:24:57] Just_Say_Yo: @Towelliee They will announce 9.2
[4:24:58] mulletrocker11358: 3 yr expansion!
[4:25:03] kokochris: for sure
[4:25:09] Birder_L: more John hight teasing!
[4:25:10] mavericks312: gamescon could announce 9.2 though
[4:25:12] Unciatim: Might be in 9.1 still next Feb also...
[4:25:18] Eraste: i mean i hope the online one is still like around november - its not like they're surprised this time and have to do it way later
[4:25:20] MrGrimms: Hey @Towelliee which logitech headset are you using now? Trying to find a new headset vs my corsair void pros
[4:25:21] skymercii: didnt sl just come out last august ?
[4:25:23] lrddoom: they dont even have this exp ready dont think they even have an idea for next exp
[4:25:40] AtomicHeartSon: You think we're only going to have a 3 patch expansion?
[4:25:43] ShaunsterTheMonster: I wonder how big 10.0 will be
[4:25:53] cosmichushpuppy: Nah he's saying 9.1 will still be "current" come next february
[4:25:54] SonofHorus82: SL came out in November.
[4:25:54] frantz_us: @MrGrimms I think the logitechs are too constraining on your head, I would look at hyperx cloud 2 wireless I love it
[4:25:55] kokochris: @lrddoom they actually work on more than one expac at a time
[4:26:05] FerociouzMonk: Draenor Classic Kappa

[4:26:32] Exodeo_: I already want this expansion to be over tbh
[4:26:39] lrddoom: @kokochris that is the problem then :D
[4:26:42] mavericks312: Activision puts out Cods just for quick sales there not changing the every 2 year expansion
[4:26:45] MrGrimms: @frantz_us ok that helps. I had the HS60s from corsair but the ear cup fell off it after a year, and my void pros are so bulky
[4:26:48] KillaFin: blizz would haft to club us with 3 patches worth of content for me to care KEKWDISCO
[4:27:01] neverbornlucky: The Next expansion will be the wow converts to a VR MMORPG you all have to get vr headsets to play
[4:27:05] Wildside1177: You have to equip the item and then use it
[4:27:12] NovaSun84: click item then click again
[4:27:14] Punchenbag: eat more fiber
[4:27:16] kokochris: @lrddoom nah thats normal.  Not all members are needed during the release of an xpac.  many artists, story, quest design and major technical features can start on the next expact right away.
[4:27:17] ninedraft317: you got to be closer
[4:27:17] NovaSun84: cause equp needed
[4:27:42] Lorunex: @Towelliee Do you really believe that its still quite a mess, and usually they work ahead a patch, so i doubt the next one will come much quicker. But who knows
[4:27:49] TheCliffyShow: I figured it would be green.
[4:28:00] Valoryan: ewfer
[4:28:08] froodyo: HOWS SHADOWLANDS BRO

[4:28:51] Adenx: Hey @towelliee,love the vibes in your stream while playing wow. Appreciate you!
[4:29:05] Lorunex: I hope it will come quick, but i fear the worst :)
[4:29:18] TheCliffyShow: @neverbornlucky His spirit was split in two, remember.
[4:29:18] KillaFin: I don't know the apathy seems higher than it has ever been for shadowlands
[4:29:20] Eraste: @neverbornlucky he didnt join the forsworn till slightly after wotlk
[4:29:22] cosmichushpuppy: I would hope 9.2 came quicker now that California is finally going back to normal

[4:33:09] frantz_us: @MrGrimms def checkout the hyper X headsets, the logitech ones hurt my head
[4:33:11] CodyKane: Mortal Kombat Legacy on Youtube is legit

[4:49:28] Nokterian: still 13 euro's in the EU
[4:49:30] IZemekiSI: the difference in prices is due to currency exchange rates
[4:49:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: 15 bucks little man put that shit in my hand
[4:49:34] zekobunny: They should have separate prices for countries with lower economic standard though. 15$ is like 150$/month for me.
[4:49:35] thrakan84: MMO is a super cheap hobby
[4:49:52] thrakan84: @HaxzorJimDuggan You owe me owe me owe me
[4:49:53] OnceAMoose: $15 a month saves me from spending $15 at the bar every Friday and Saturday night.
[4:49:58] Nokterian: MMO is big time investment
[4:50:18] porowozek: they are
[4:50:22] IZemekiSI: it is because of exchange rate
[4:50:28] OnceAMoose: They just started to do that.
[4:50:31] IZemekiSI: depends on worth of your money
[4:50:35] Avaricious_83: £9.99 for me

[4:50:45] IZemekiSI: people paying with euro going to pay the least
[4:51:25] ochiero_amarru: there's nothing like questing in Stranglethorn and rocking out to the song 'welcome to the Jungle' to get you pumping
[4:51:41] tyrel_jones: Carion Grubbage? More like Carion Garbage
[4:51:43] andycoin99: Damn already level 57

[4:52:42] IZemekiSI: yeah tokens on tich are 186k but can grind that in a few days
[4:52:45] PvtHudson093: too bad the token price shot up because of tbcc pre-patch
[4:53:19] Nokterian: I played tons of mmo's
[4:53:21] Nokterian: all of them
[4:53:28] Eraste: im glad i can just pay the $15 again, last year was rough and had to grind out the gold, and i haaaate grinding gold
[4:53:30] Nokterian: i keep going back to WoW
[4:53:35] Nokterian: it's my comfort zone
[4:53:42] GoonGeta: Hey new to WoW, I'm trying to figure out what is the best pet(s) for Classic TBC for leveling, I'm currently lvl 39. I got broken tooth, but his attack speed is no longer 2.0 so is he still viable?
[4:53:50] XshadowturkeyX: also tbh i think blizz would want more people paying their sub with gold , if peopel are still buying tokens, 20$ vs 15$ yeah
[4:54:18] mikejames01: 186k USA on tokens as of now
[4:54:27] CaptainJoeyNY: with the shop

[4:55:53] Saephon: $15 a month has given me the best entertainment per dollar in my entire life
[4:55:55] IZemekiSI: yea the token itself is actually 20 not 15
[4:56:08] AtomicHeartSon: why not the SWTOR model?
[4:56:09] thrakan84: side note 18.99 CAD not 22.00 CAD
[4:56:13] thrakan84: per month
[4:56:21] ochiero_amarru: anyone else rock out to the song 'Welcome to the Jungle' by guns and roses while questing through Stranglethorn Vale
[4:56:36] Camtully: @king_rhino88 Who doesnt? SeemsGood
[4:57:12] thrakan84: 16.75 CAD if you buy 6 months at a time
[4:57:15] swordart_19: I pay so it is not free to play 4Head
[4:57:15] Raanoren: swtor has a healthy population
[4:57:19] illuminationpaladincurse: Blizzard andy
[4:57:20] ochiero_amarru: @Camtully Right!
[4:57:20] CaptainJoeyNY: ESO store aint bad

[4:58:00] AtomicHeartSon: There's only like 5 servers left, but each server looks WAY better than half the servers on retail
[4:58:01] chaosjoshua: 5
[4:58:17] Darzetti_: 5 not 4
[4:58:20] mikejames01: and most players on SWTOR are on 2 servers

[5:01:16] ShiggyDiggyTVz: ShiggyDiggyTVz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[5:01:19] Lesrek: @Dankifide_ The issue is that not only does the game need to be better than WoW, but it needs to overcome WoW's inertia and people's sunk cost into WoW.  Not sure another MMO will ever be able to do that.
[5:01:27] idenkaz_: i'm ready for sword of legends man, the beta one was a seller for me.

[9:44:42] jakedawg490: nice nice, thanks for responding.
[9:44:46] Kineticbomb: You don't need gold to go into TBC . The quests give a lot of gold and even more when you reach 70. Also daily quests unlock that's even more gold.
[9:44:52] Thunderbrew: How much is Epic Riding?
[9:44:52] 91Niki: @Munnes Wtf ...
[9:44:54] Atruis_: I will be going into TBC with 10g
[9:44:55] nautilus209: @paulcernik There are a lot of quests where you just need an item and dont need to put the quest in your log until youre ready to turn in. Also a lot of quests have 4 or 5 quests that you turn in to the same person, or someone nearby. There is a list for that sort of thing.
[9:44:56] findobin: I have 250 gold at 60, not even epic riding FeelsBadMan
