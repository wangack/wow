[0:20:32] Izostarx: Yes.
[0:20:33] MonsterhunterP: arcane is the best caster though not?
[0:20:40] welaxoxo: no just lame drama
[0:21:30] astrry: of course Kappa
[0:21:37] boltqt_: It doesn't matter if its one player
[0:21:43] archtme: is it wrong or right to say there's only like two teams in EU that omega try hard the awc?
[0:22:00] MonsterhunterP: well in lol they do balance changes for every skilltier
[0:22:08] boltqt_: A design flaw would be knowing that a spec is clearly too strong @ its skill cap, and allowing it go under the presumption that "its only him"
[0:22:12] sponkss: Isn't that kind of a weird argument also? You're not gna balance sub rogue around the average sub rogue player, you gotta balance around the players that can get the maximum out of the class
[0:22:13] welaxoxo: i mean the game is always gonna have counters, its bad when one class beats everything
[0:22:26] Mozaiczny: Are you recommend mage as long term caster? Ret pala main, wanna change to something range
[0:23:02] kilralium: yo against what comps do u usually play blinkstun ? i dont like playing it against anything other than sub rog, feel like anyother class is very kitable with shimmer

[0:27:24] blackvpnv: team with fistweather and deva can be scary since u dont get to much practice against

[0:46:35] cosmo30k: too alty lmao
[0:46:59] archtme: did peope multiclass alot in the older days? I think I remember people not doing it that much but I could be wrong
[0:47:22] bebibroumch: are there still blizzcon?
[0:47:31] arcwingsz: that's a LONG q
[0:47:59] cosmo30k: why though, its just as impressive to be the team that adapted the best to the new expansion and meta
[0:48:25] bebibroumch: me i always think u can stop play wow for 3 years straight and come back at ur max lvl in like few weeks
[0:48:47] bebibroumch: so i dont think player are scaling hard during the exp
[0:49:31] wild_carry: @Raikubest When are u pulling out the full mastery fire?
[0:49:48] bebibroumch: player have reach the skill cap in wow few years ago already imo
[0:49:50] cosmo30k: is there any kinds of LANs this year?
[0:50:08] simstarx: @cosmo30k KEKW
[0:50:22] cosmo30k: just asking because lontar like a month ago was talking about there being one
[0:50:46] didieris: i want to bet on awc matches its ez money
[0:50:51] didieris: it would be*
[0:50:59] cosmo30k: i just dont understand why not, the AWC finals filled the entire blizzcon hall every year, what is their reasoning behind it
[0:51:11] sistahfistah1: i had mehh in my shuffle yday he still plays the game Stare
[0:51:17] bebibroumch: how much can u win playing wow professionaly if u win everything during the year ? @Raikubest
[0:51:49] bebibroumch: ok
[0:51:49] sponkss: Man ur getting a que, rly
[0:51:58] akswow: that's kinda bad
[0:51:59] Warbayx: u made fat stacks last year?
[0:52:07] bebibroumch: with taxes its like 30k right
[0:52:10] archtme: blizzard scaled back their entire esports division a few years ago, they probably just decided not to keep the lans going because of that. They cost alot

[0:52:34] prikaze: who u think will win awc this year eu or na ?
[0:52:41] Ceribi: u always get drdaggers
[0:52:48] cosmo30k: does the finals at blizzcon really cost them that much if blizzcon is happening anyways? @archtme
[0:52:54] man0litos: whats your view on arcane right now and in the meta? saw cdew cry twitter again and i want another point of view
[0:52:56] SaltyBites: not a lot of return from wow esports but they could keep blizzcons for sure
[0:52:58] sistahfistah1: drdagger snipes the mage ques so he gets 2 rmp games ofc
[0:53:17] sponkss: i'm never getting a pop LMAO
[0:53:18] tormyboo: mariabanks 5-1 time?
[0:53:48] archtme: @cosmo30k it's not just the prize pools, it's admins, tech people, computers, casters, the whole jazz costs quite a bit to field and Blizzard clearly tries to cut their e-sport costs these days unfortunately. It's not just WoW it's all their games
[0:55:03] sponkss: Sadly enough i'm still in my 4 hour que
[0:55:11] cosmo30k: @archtme yea i wasnt really referring to the price pool, more alluding to the question if awc finals, were they to happen at blizzcon, would cost them that much more than whatever they would be doing in that hall at that timeslot instead if there was no awc
[0:55:54] sistahfistah1: i was jamming to the music :(
[0:56:14] bebibroumch: he do the same afk or not tbh

[1:13:39] Joke_Fistweaver: @Saphya_ is it worth fake casting with penance?

[1:14:15] Saphya_: if its mage 99% of them are gonna try to kick it so its easy precog to just start penance and insta cancel after 1 bolt
[1:14:27] Saphya_: not working into raiku tho from what i recall
[1:14:35] Joke_Fistweaver: yeah depends on the player
[1:15:24] mrturkishpeter: @Raikubest Could you share some tips fos us arcane mages stuck on 2k? Feels like there are so many games where you dont matter.
[1:15:45] Skyler33: damn sounds like picking up girls
[1:16:20] tanguero: @Raikubest yo, how u can do big dam if u cant cast arcane blast?
[1:16:31] bebibroumch: but at some point u can get a 95% fake cast and all theory falls of
[1:16:56] Elo92: isn't the situation with the druid the same tho? can just hold and kick at 95%
[1:17:40] Joke_Fistweaver: I tried this the other day Raiku, did you know you can snipe a grounding totem with nether tempest (even with 0 combo points it dies in 1 second)
[1:17:51] Joke_Fistweaver: you can even nether tempest an enemy near a grounding and it will spread to it and kill it
[1:17:53] Joke_Fistweaver: @Raikubest
[1:18:21] cosmo30k: does clearcasting increase missile dmg too or smth or is it litrally just no mana cost

[1:20:30] freshmintx: oh when did they add combo points on mages lmao
[1:20:30] ratbttm: oo
[1:20:55] Dexlol123: u can regen mana with something?
[1:21:13] deno65: kinda hardest spec in the game i say
[1:21:15] tanguero: so if u cant cast arcane blast u need press spellsteal and spam missiles? but what about arcane barrage?
[1:22:25] maybethistimepls: u saw those games?
[1:23:13] Dexlol123: from druid pov it look like arcane can purge way too much
[1:23:54] Dexlol123: LUL
[1:23:54] cosmo30k: what do combo points do for arcnae
[1:24:09] buffmagespls: arcane mage counters bm hunter + dk confirmed?

[1:25:49] maybethistimepls: hes a lil crybaby
[1:26:11] Deathmarkedx: i always do the most dmg as arcane when i face double melee lol
[1:26:18] Deathmarkedx: or NPC specs
[1:26:42] thewhiteguywhoisblack: lmao lost all respect for that guy
[1:26:46] FoxiekittenWoW: why dont you just tell him?
[1:26:52] common96: Is frost mage solid in the current meta?
[1:26:55] MonsterhunterP: tbf he also perma says nerf rogue when hes playing with one so you cant rly say hes biased
[1:27:00] FoxiekittenWoW: he obviously feels like it unplayable when he face it
[1:27:26] Saphya_: they kinda did judging from dragon state rn xD
[1:27:36] Ceribi: i feel like cdew always wants stuff nerfed
[1:27:39] salk76: nope, but blizzard defs won't think rationally
[1:27:44] cosmo30k: which mage spec do you want to be good the most aka you have the most fun withh

[1:27:49] kitra__: What happened what happened
[1:27:58] hiraad12: I can ignore arcane mages in the scenario u described earlier cause they do so little dmg. Cant say that about a lot of other class specs
[1:28:01] Emiliiooz: have u started to wargame ppl on tourney server?
[1:28:03] Whaazz: cdew muted raikus mic
[1:28:04] Whaazz: he had enough
[1:28:08] dankgamer97: KEKW  󠀀
[1:28:10] MonsterhunterP: nah not true he always says rogues too op and he plays with one
[1:28:21] Ocbpls: LUL
[1:28:22] Whaazz: he tweeted at warcraftdevs, nerf mage mics Kappa
[1:28:26] Deathmarkedx: @MonsterhunterP name another spec then
[1:28:43] salk76: another mage nerf inc. KappaWealth
[1:28:50] dankgamer97: Blizzard muted Raiku monkaS
[1:29:08] MonsterhunterP: i dont need to when this evidence exists, and in my opinion rogue arcanemage are 2 of the most op classes rn
[1:29:15] MonsterhunterP: so hes right
[1:29:25] Nateypww: instantly cancelled
[1:29:25] Ocbpls: monkaS

[1:29:55] Ocbpls: Sadge
[1:29:56] FoxiekittenWoW: but why does it matter if he says they need to nerf arcane mage? they have so many stats behind the scenes and if they tell another story than his feelings then why would they ever listen to him anyways os its kinda pointless
[1:29:56] salk76: :-------(
[1:29:57] surfon: bruh missed 30 min q feelsbad
[1:30:06] EkenTV: rip

[1:30:11] dankgamer97: Cdew at Raiku's door monkaS
[1:30:25] Ceribi: black suvs pulled up
[1:30:26] ylyox: cdew just cries when he loses
[1:30:37] ylyox: didnt ask for boomy nerfs when he was winning blizzcon
[1:31:04] Tippolippo: wueee wueee indeed
[1:31:05] salk76: forsenE
[1:31:08] kelqoo: @chyo__ why ask for nerf when u can find and abuse an bug KEKW the cdew way
[1:31:44] ylyox: lol true
[1:31:51] Deathmarkedx: @FoxiekittenWoW they also have so many stats behind for DH and WW and we see what happened
[1:31:54] Deathmarkedx: not the best example
[1:32:06] Deathmarkedx: blizzard isnt really the most competent when it comes to balancing pvp

[1:32:45] DeityRevert: they just rotate balance. there is no such thing as perfect balance
[1:32:48] Deathmarkedx: true, they didnt even make changes between patches in the past
[1:32:52] mewtish: !awc
[1:33:02] DeityRevert: perfect pvp balance would be making all the classes the exact same
[1:33:10] Whaazz: gg
[1:33:12] Whaazz: cdew broke stream
[1:33:14] Whaazz: cu later guys
[1:33:24] dankgamer97: trenXD
[1:33:30] FoxiekittenWoW: @Deathmarkedx sure they could be better, but i dont think cdew tweeting about nerfing arcane mage will have any impact on what they do, so its kinda irrelevant no?
[1:33:34] salk76: pce pce 👹
[1:33:42] man0litos: the perfect balance, is never the goal, in any game.  the goal is the game to be fun.  At least as the other guy said they make changes every month. We use to have the same patch for a wwhole season
[1:33:45] Deathmarkedx: @FoxiekittenWoW these people influence balancing way more than u think

[1:35:26] FoxiekittenWoW: @Deathmarkedx if they listened to cdew rogues would not be a class right now
[1:35:43] man0litos: haha correct
[1:35:48] Deathmarkedx: obviously they wont listen to 1 guy alone KEKW
[1:36:37] Deathmarkedx: tbh i dont even know what gamestate cdew would like
[1:36:58] man0litos: i think you do
[1:37:00] jeaskull: yo @raiku curious how do you play music on your stream on twitch without getting copyright ban
[1:37:02] Deathmarkedx: 1 hand he wants to nerf everything that makes games fast other hand he complains when games are too damp

[1:50:53] cosmo30k: does sam play 0 mage atm?
[1:51:02] FoxiekittenWoW: why tho, its so irrelevant no?
[1:51:23] Zuk_______: i tweeted about dh buff sry
[1:51:42] Berlyirltv: thats cooked take, why should something that's overtuned not be complained about?
[1:51:49] Elozern: doesn't feel like a thing cdew would to tbh :D
[1:51:55] bonern123: @Raikubest do you play glacial spike atm on frost because of the set bonus? :)
[1:51:59] Elozern: he is kinda selfreflected most of the time
[1:52:23] Berlyirltv: no one cares what he tweets about
[1:52:30] tanguero: @Raikubest if u cant cast arcane blast u need press spellsteal and spam missiles? but what about arcane barrage?
[1:52:45] Berlyirltv: the argument is that you're saying that he shouldnt voice his opinion on something thats overtuned
[1:52:54] Elozern: @Berlyirltv false. at least many of his low xpd viewership will care about it
[1:52:55] chromaxen: Bro didnt cdew nerfed prot palas in sl by a single tweet?
[1:53:15] FoxiekittenWoW: yea sure its not a good take on the state of arcane mage right now. But he obviously feels it op when he face arcane mage, so him tweeting about them means nothing, what different would it ever have on the balancing if one guy alone thinks they are op. Thats why i thinks its super iirelevant
[1:53:39] Berlyirltv: alot of people do that though, don't really see how it's going to make a difference. People constantly argue for something that would benefit their own team.
[1:53:52] Veruuqq: losing one matchup doesnt mean the spec is overtunned. He should not be tweeting abt it after 1 session losing streak
[1:53:58] dankgamer97: have you played sp after reset ?
[1:53:59] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[1:54:19] Berlyirltv: I disagree
[1:54:30] Izostarx: I dont think he can tho?
[1:54:35] Ceribi: well blizzard balances based off na so makes sense
[1:54:37] FoxiekittenWoW: he doesn´t, if he had any agency rogue would not be a class right now
[1:54:39] leibowitzr10: you think wow devs arent watching their streams?
[1:54:48] leibowitzr10: @Berlyirltv
[1:54:59] chromaxen: Even holinka said he looked upto cdew in an interview
[1:55:12] Berlyirltv: wow "devs" ? there's like 1 intern working on wow pvp
[1:55:18] FoxiekittenWoW: but if he can which i dont think, its not a cdew problem is a devs problem.

[1:56:33] pazta9: Yes ofc
[1:56:40] pazta9: Thug is a g
[1:56:41] Zenlyn: thats why they shouldnt listen to anyone and just look at statistics
[1:56:47] Zenlyn: there's too much bias
[1:56:50] MonsterhunterP: there should be balance changes cosidering every skill level
[1:56:51] Ceribi: thug is older than infernion. true
[1:56:52] Deathmarkedx: they dont even look at stats either
[1:56:54] Elo92: yes, because fk locks :D
[1:56:56] klikka: @Raikubest i mean the number of a class doesnt say anything about how strong it is or?
[1:56:57] Berlyirltv: @Zenlyn +
[1:57:08] astrry: ofc, can't have a measly warlock bullying crayon eaters
[1:57:10] Deathmarkedx: they balance whatever they feel like
[1:57:21] yesayax: @Zenlyn true, BLIZZARD HAS ALL THE DATA. ANALYZE THE DATA. UTILIZE THE DATA TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES
[1:57:41] tedstaTV: did they listen to cdew?
[1:57:41] Saphya_: but you cant also balance the game around winrates on 1,4-1,8, statistisc sure but it has to be at least 2,4+ statistics
[1:57:52] Deathmarkedx: but they ARE balancing game around shuffle
[1:57:57] Zenlyn: U know rat says is the best " blizz have no idea what they want pvp to be and they just listen to random biased players for changes "
[1:57:59] Berlyirltv: Problem though is that players complained alot about them not listening to the players when making changes
[1:58:06] pazta9: But wont that create a perfect game for most but bad for top players?
[1:58:10] Saphya_: i meant it in the range mentioned
[1:58:12] Malte_L: Kappa
[1:58:14] pazta9: Or am i retarded
[1:58:17] kreyzy8: cdew did say that he understands he's very good at arcane, but that it's completely brainless to press spellsteal 85 times in one game with no repercussion
[1:58:54] slimjd33: Idk if you balance around shuffle then classes that rely on team play like sp will be insane in 3s if they’re good in shufdle
[1:58:57] klikka: @Raikubest what about tournaments tho? you gonna have insanely imbalanced tournaments if you balance around average players
[1:59:06] Deathmarkedx: fan
[1:59:07] Zenlyn: just mutilate
[1:59:08] Zenlyn: or somthn
[1:59:18] Malte_L: Overpower
[1:59:27] astrry: it's a combo point builder but you actually have 2 different sets of combo points (charges and clearcasting)
[1:59:39] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Raiku and enter code: ECHO

[2:00:56] Deathmarkedx: or press explosion but yeah
[2:01:25] FoxiekittenWoW: have you talked with cdew about his tweet since you think its so outrageous and beleive he has agency to change a class with a tweet. I btw agree with you that its a ridiculous tweet, but i dont think he has power to change anything.
[2:01:54] Zenlyn: ur wrong
[2:01:56] Zenlyn: he does have power
[2:02:04] Zenlyn: NA players have way more influence than anyone else in wow
[2:02:04] Deathmarkedx: i said it before aswell
[2:02:10] Deathmarkedx: these people influence balancing way more than people think
[2:02:17] pazta9: Cdew def has influence
[2:02:31] Snapcast95: what i don’t understand with arcane damage is when I should be casting arcane blasts
[2:02:33] tommymage: what was the tweet
[2:02:36] tommymage: and what was ur opinion
[2:02:38] pazta9: One of the people with the most influence of all players
[2:02:43] FoxiekittenWoW: but where is the evidance that he has power?
[2:02:45] Zenlyn: https://twitter.com/cdew_wow/status/1750423698237014037
[2:02:47] Zenlyn: That
[2:02:58] Malte_L: 100% devs listen to ppl like cdew ven and supa. especially these 3
[2:03:02] Elozern: @Snapcast95 e.g. when u cannot be kicked and have nothing else to press
[2:03:04] FoxiekittenWoW: he has complained about rogues since forever and they are still good
[2:03:15] Elozern: @Elozern no clearcasting etc
[2:03:17] tommymage: kubzy does big dam
[2:03:25] tommymage: and he only complains about arcane when its kubzy
[2:03:25] yesayax: @FoxiekittenWoW this is a good argument tbh
[2:03:32] Zenlyn: while i agree its annoying to be spam purged its like hes missing key information
[2:03:42] astrry: shame we didn't see the damage to players
[2:03:53] Avansys: bro i think they should balance game around u no joke
[2:03:54] Zenlyn: but u know raiku
[2:03:58] tommymage: but i also saw kubzy and them lose a lot because he just did dam and didnt cc like maros team did vs them
[2:03:58] Zenlyn: they will prob nerf spellsteal
[2:03:59] sparqTTV: thats like balancing rogue around kalvish xD
[2:04:00] Zenlyn: then what will u do
[2:04:00] Zenlyn: HAHA
[2:04:01] astrry: I wonder how much of that is orbs or barrages cleaving pets
[2:04:07] Klamer2860: whats your take on evokers atm , seems rediculess to me
[2:04:24] Snapcast95: @elozern so if no kick ab and if can be kicked spell steal spam for missile procs?
[2:04:25] Zenlyn: statistics + feeling of playing balance around those
[2:04:28] dankgamer97: Raiku, mage will now get nerfed because of cdew.. Just reroll shadow priest EZ
[2:04:33] Malte_L: but thats what chuck always does every season. i never see him tweet that rsham or ww dk needs a nerf. only his competitiv enemys
[2:04:35] Zenlyn: like sure statistically X can be good but if its not fun to play against somthn has to change
[2:04:35] tommymage: 1 spell steal
[2:04:37] Zenlyn: thats the only exception
[2:04:38] tommymage: clear casting proc
[2:04:39] tommymage: gg
[2:04:42] Elozern: @Snapcast95 ye most of the time

[2:04:49] Deathmarkedx: they will make spellsteal cost 50k mana
[2:04:51] SirBeaverTeeth: there's an episode on technically pvp when curney rants so long about how bad cdews takes are on balance issues x)
[2:04:52] Deathmarkedx: for more procs Kappa
[2:04:54] Avansys: they should balance mages around u cuz u best mage in game
[2:05:12] Elozern: @Elozern also can use ring of fire well as gap
[2:05:14] R3IDERWAR: ı am player warrior ı dont like mage 😒
[2:05:23] R3IDERWAR: ıf he with me ı like
[2:05:25] nyzeofc: but with balancing you should still cap the maximum of whats possible to do, no? @Raikubest
[2:05:32] Zenlyn: LMAO I do this, but its just raging i dont actually want shit to change
[2:05:33] R3IDERWAR: ıf he enemy ı dont like😁
[2:05:34] Zenlyn: except druids tho
[2:05:37] DeityRevert: pretty sure the vast majority of their balancing is based on their stats. they literally say that multiple times
[2:05:37] tommymage: also a flawed view tho
[2:05:41] tommymage: i agree but its flawed
[2:05:48] bankstair: but the average playerbase is looking up to the top 10%
[2:05:53] StriKE_40k: FuyukaShino subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:05:56] tommymage: because lower exp players dont abuse things top players can
[2:05:56] SirBeaverTeeth: i mean it's impossible to balance for all ratings
[2:06:03] tommymage: like i remember assa when it was so broken ss1
[2:06:05] tommymage: did bad at low ratings
[2:06:12] Zuk_______: balance with stats = nerf dh buff mage
[2:06:15] tommymage: cuz they wernt nelf and didnt go for re stealths and triple garrote
[2:06:48] Klamer2860: how do you counter evoker? i dont see any counterplay..
[2:06:57] Zenlyn: The thing is tho raiku we're looking at it from a league perspective, where 80% of the game is like emerald / plat etc but 80% of wow pvpers are ACTUALLY 800-1600. if we balanced around this the game would LOOK SOOOOOOOO different
[2:06:59] Zenlyn: @Raikubest
[2:07:00] tommymage: it reminds me of swapxy in legion
[2:07:00] grris: KEKW
[2:07:01] grris: trueee
[2:07:02] tommymage: he used to do this
[2:07:08] tommymage: on twitter

[2:07:31] tommymage: swapxy would beat a frost mage 4-1 then tweet the next day about how frost mage is so broken
[2:07:34] tommymage: good content
[2:07:42] iwata64: @Raikubest Is your team same as last AWC ?
[2:07:44] taylors09: @Zenlyn 90% of leageu are not emerald plat, what u smoking
[2:07:49] Zenlyn: arent they?
[2:07:50] taylors09: 80%*
[2:07:50] applescruffs23: for solo shuffle do you think arcane is best or is frost better for dealing with melee cleaves?
[2:07:50] Zenlyn: whast the graph
[2:07:55] R3IDERWAR: @zenlyn in shadowlands we played with u ) u helped me
[2:08:04] Zenlyn: wasnt plat the highest on the graph
[2:08:13] SirBeaverTeeth: i feel sad about fire mage, none's gonna play =(
[2:08:15] FoxiekittenWoW: @Zenlyn i think 80% of league players is in gold or below
[2:08:16] Omgg_TV: Lontarito Babarito
[2:08:34] Zenlyn: ok sorry https://i.imgur.com/7WungCv.png
[2:08:40] yesayax: Tough take: if the whole game would be perfectly balanced --> rogue would be worse than it is now
[2:08:44] Zenlyn: but most wow players are sub 1400?
[2:08:45] Zenlyn: legitimately

[2:08:51] Defrozen10: why didint buff fire
[2:09:12] FoxiekittenWoW: @Zenlyn i think most is between 1400-1800
[2:09:14] Malte_L: you were better with mehh on mains but better on alt comps with lonar
[2:09:17] Malte_L: i would say
[2:09:19] tuiztv: Hey @Raikubest I asked whazz about how he makes his focus cast bar bigger with jaxclassicframes 10 times yday and got no response LUL Do you have any idea?
[2:10:35] FoxiekittenWoW: @Zenlyn skill capped just did a videos about this topic actually, quite good video :D
[2:10:42] badmy__: I think they have team of analysts and very complex simulation engines to balance abilities/stats near decently every expansion. But for pve. For pvp they have 1-2 alcoholic devs which cheese monthly salary and straight troll the community.
[2:10:45] Ahbe: meehx not playing atm?
[2:10:49] iwata64: Were Mehhx reasons to stop competing personnal or WoW related?
[2:10:58] FoxiekittenWoW: he was just burned out

[2:12:27] Malte_L: Ltr
[2:12:40] dankgamer97: The ultrabull ? jazggzDespair
[2:12:52] yesayax: jack of all trades
[2:13:24] iwata64: that was beautiful seeing you stomp everyone with RMP for 2 years straight though
[2:13:28] astrry: I mean you can just say "shadowlands", no? you 1-tricked the comp since your return
[2:13:31] RabbitCollector: can i link a pikaboo vod of a rogue he thinks was cheating, ur view on it would be cool
[2:13:48] yesayax: Mehhx, Whaazz, Raiku the best RMP to ever exist imo :)
[2:13:52] Omgg_TV: Do you ever worry you might be spreading yourselves too thin?
[2:14:04] astrry: I meant all  of shadowlands
[2:14:13] astrry: since you returned to awc
[2:14:17] Klamer2860: if you were suposte to give an advice for a returning player that really want to push , glad, like your top 1 tip @Raikubest also is it stupid to push at this point of the season?

[2:14:42] nyzeofc: did meh stop playing?
[2:14:42] FoxiekittenWoW: what have made you change that strats then? why dont you just play 1-2 comp and become experts at it since it has worked so well in the past
[2:14:53] Ahbe: @Klamer2860 play 6h a day
[2:14:56] Zenlyn: key word being almost
[2:15:03] Zenlyn: coz in my case thats not the case
[2:15:04] Zenlyn: HAHA
[2:15:11] tommymage: just depends what u play
[2:15:17] tommymage: 1 tricking warrior likely not that good
[2:15:19] AsdOfc: u need to be good also @Zenlyn Kappa
