[1:46:22] TheCliffyShow: Oh, damn
[1:46:32] alundrius: i like it
[1:46:36] kodue: lock bonus rolls behind difficult content, like if you complete the raid you'd get one and / or if you do like 5 m+ or something, one time a week BUT the bonus roll is 100% rather than a shitty rng fest
[1:46:49] SonofHorus82: well I guess I'm not getting it until patch 12.0 then.
[1:46:51] LSBreed: wouldn't that bring people to BIS faster, I turn lowering the "grind" did they add anything to keep us playing or...?

[2:25:59] ReinaldoNS: yes, because it counts for each condem, so on cleave, it is just a fiesta
[2:26:03] Talason: towelliee why does bellular always call you a blizzard insider
[2:26:10] Wcvechten: does the appearance tab already have the gearsets for the raid/pvp in it?
[2:26:15] Getitonthelow: ok tldr who got nerfed?
[2:26:24] RocketMan23: max was saying that warrior wasnt as good as they were expecting i though
[2:26:30] Talason: haha
[2:26:31] LucidAntics: balance druids got destroyed
[2:26:35] haderdaraide: Wait I made 40 mil off leggos, are there new ones to craft and sell???
[2:26:35] king_julian_96: Towelliee do you think with how much stuff they currently got in the ptr could you see 9.1 coming out in July
[2:26:37] Its_big_t: true
[2:26:41] zoovthepally: Any word on if new characters will have to grind 0-40 renown or will they just start at 40
[2:26:44] Lincoln_WoW: he quotes you constantly
[2:26:47] Gruffian: People thought banner would be OP before and that didnt end up being the case
[2:26:50] Talason: he said it like 10 times throughout all his videos
[2:26:53] xluckydawgx: @Towelliee I sent you a twitter DM about a sword in the new raid
[2:26:54] zoovthepally: New characters in 9.1 that is
[2:27:02] magemaster225: he makes like 20 clips of one stream and there was just one stream he mentions you
[2:27:04] Quimby54: The guy loves drama
[2:27:29] feelu_: well this would be the only thing that he could be inside ;)
[2:27:29] Mecabeast: but will we get a portal to our sanctum from oribos
[2:27:38] filos0phia: it's not even that's it's OP, it's just what could you want more as a tank ability than jacking up the dps of your dps?
[2:27:42] filos0phia: in WF
[2:27:45] MleveK: what anima change?
[2:27:47] astranna: can you swap covenants and unlock all the trees on ptr?
[2:27:49] Broomba: Inside trader @towelliee
[2:27:53] ArcaneSyntax: I don't understand being mad about the anima change lmao
[2:28:03] mysteriousm4n: what change
[2:28:20] Lincoln_WoW: i don't think that legedary is that great tbh. it only affects the Warrior.
[2:28:29] dalaraz: @MleveK you multiply the rewards off of everything with couple easy achievements baset on covenant buildings level
[2:28:33] Sollice: #fuckshades affix

[2:28:48] BadXo: I say August
[2:28:53] crashyk_87: they did data mine a seasonal affix on the MDI realm though. saw it on mmo champ some time ago.
[2:28:54] magemaster225: june would get it in before the big fiscal stuff so thats probably the target
[2:29:11] ArcaneSyntax: Not August hhmmmm
[2:29:23] mavericks312: if 9.1 drops june/july tbc would be august is my thoughts
[2:29:29] Rictamar: June 1st is ESO expac, Fall 2021 is FFXIV Endwalker, so between those is ideal
[2:29:35] Marmoh: I mean they did overlap Naxx with Shadowlands release
[2:29:36] xxAttilioxx: xxAttilioxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:29:37] ceranac23: so whats with torghast in 9.1 some achivs have stars and shit

[2:30:06] Rictamar: @Sollice right! so before August, July is perfect month
[2:30:09] Talason: should i call up ion? failur3Ion
[2:30:12] Ambersulfr: As long as Blizzard is making progress, I'm OK with them taking time to release.
[2:30:14] mavericks312: i thinking august is when tbc drops
[2:30:15] dimofodi: It isn't that they probably mind, it's the issue of the shitstorm from players if they don't make an estimated (not even a hard date, an estimated date)
[2:30:21] crashyk_87: @Sollice yeah 9.1 will probably drop in august when new world drops:p
[2:30:29] Ambersulfr: I was upset before the PTR drop because they were giving zero info.
[2:30:29] ArcaneSyntax: I can see why they don't do announcements for dates because people would get ULTRA tilted if they blow release dates @Towelliee
[2:30:30] dalaraz: i think theres a reason t he say before 31dec for everything nowadays,they dont risk timeframes
[2:30:30] AudioJaq: It would be nice if they didn’t stack BC on top, but they didn’t care when it came to Naxx and Shadowlands
[2:30:38] Sollice: i hope not crash, if they HOLD the patch to do that would be pretty shitty
[2:30:49] dotworx: cd is really good
[2:30:57] dotworx: endurence
[2:31:01] dotworx: haste
[2:31:03] Talason: towelliee i almost have full 226 condi's....did i waste my time?
[2:31:07] Lincoln_WoW: hammer for dungeons
[2:31:10] crashyk_87: well, not the first time they have dropped a major content patch when something else releases though @Sollice
[2:31:11] Balzofsteels: have you seen anything about wearing 2 legendary yet ?
[2:31:22] Lincoln_WoW: 2 legos is not on the PTR
[2:31:27] MarquisLek: can we fly yet
[2:31:29] Sollice: Thats true. They do it all the time but they say it's not on purpose lol. Which we all know is bullshit
[2:31:30] Lincoln_WoW: its not planned for 9.1
[2:31:37] Numaiirr: yo guys if you never played wow and want to start with is what tip do you guys have ???
[2:31:53] Riggoz1: they really need to remove that conduit energy
[2:31:54] Enigmio: 2 legos pretty sure on last patch
[2:32:01] Sollice: @DubbelJoe I think you can get a trial account for free. Play as many classes as you can
[2:32:05] Talason: towelliee i almost have full 226 condi's....did i waste my time?
[2:32:18] KVANNORWICK: I love divine toll
[2:32:31] Strouss: for the first time in a while i dont see beta for 9.1.... im sad i want to test it.
[2:32:34] Talason: lol
[2:32:36] Mecabeast: @dubbeljoe don't boost your first toon and level the first one you create you will understand how it works alot better
[2:32:38] dalaraz: 2 legos must be terribly hard to balance,im starting to doubt we will ever see 2 legos
[2:32:49] ArcaneSyntax: @Talason yes you did.
[2:32:51] magemaster225: its cause of a quest it goes away after you unlock mounts in the maw
[2:32:53] Talason: are all the condis going to 250?>
[2:33:00] Maego1: @Strouss You can just download PTR and test it, its accessible for eveyone i think
[2:33:06] Numaiirr: @Mecabeast oke dont no witch class i wanna get normally im a dpser
[2:33:20] Talason: towelliee do you think high m+ keys should drop condis?
[2:33:31] Ambersulfr: It looks like really good threat gen.
[2:33:33] RocketMan23: so divine toll on a 40 second CD now?
[2:33:37] dotworx: im considering that with my ret too

[2:36:17] etter00: do we know how high renoun can go now?
[2:36:19] Ambersulfr: It probably wouldn't hurt to get soul ash just to have it in case, but I expect there will be a new currency.
[2:36:19] magemaster225: careful, almost out of onduit energy
[2:36:21] CholThemAll: Is it going to be the same Reputation with Ve'nari but a new currency, or is it completley new rep we need to farm for sockets?
[2:36:30] Gapz: @Towelliee Ilvl upgrade comes from professions
[2:36:37] Enigmio: well i'm pretty sure, there will be upgrade levels for legendarys
[2:36:38] Lincoln_WoW: its legit .5 ppm

[2:37:44] Jarlan23: kyrian boutta get uther as a soulbind
[2:37:44] ThrasiusGG: that's pretty optimistic to think we're getting a 9.2 @Towelliee
[2:37:45] Rictamar: we aren't getting two leggos until the end of xpac, probably 9.3
[2:37:46] dotworx: ye small black trash
[2:37:46] Scoodles91: they can do the same as legion wepons, just add a second tree on the side
[2:37:47] Ambersulfr: That shield went way far... that bounce would've wiped a M+
[2:37:52] Lincoln_WoW: its pretty obvious when it spawns

[2:48:00] alundrius: covenant energy has never been relevant
[2:48:12] Malkyr: Havent boomkin been top tier for like 2 expacs now? It is ok to not be on top sometimes
[2:48:12] yoitsloid: With even more rows now, energy is gonna be even worse. Shit system

[2:51:21] Sollice: @Lulaboo Outriders still fucking me. Last night on my main I crashed 6 times in a row and I have up
[2:51:30] 91Niki: Oh i missed that. my bad

[2:51:40] Sollice: I gave up*
[2:51:41] 91Niki: doing 4 things at once :P

[2:51:50] lekkahdh: That's decentely logical aswell...
[2:51:58] RxGamer2018: NotLikeThis
[2:51:59] LucidAntics: i really wanna dps in 9.1 after healing 9.0 but i have no clue which class to go with
[2:52:12] MysticalOS: they should at least make zone transitions less crappy. they could do what they do with isle of quel danas as early as TBC, when flynig from ironforge, where you initially start flying out of city gates but then it fades out and then suddenly you're over island
[2:52:19] chuma_22: @Towelliee lockdown didnt treat u well it looks like u gained 20 lbs
[2:52:21] 91Niki: @Sollice Have you lost all your gear yet?
[2:52:24] Scoodles91: one you like the most
[2:52:28] MysticalOS: i mean if they had tech for taxi teleportation as early as TBC, why can't they do it in shadowlands, come on
[2:52:32] NovaSun84: I love icy veins for telling me what to do :)

[2:55:02] Maego1: dr. peppers
[2:55:09] RxGamer2018: Is the main story basically in the maw. Lost
[2:55:11] KristineTheUnicorn: Have you seen the raid entrance yet?

[2:55:33] 91Niki: What does it look like ?
[2:55:34] Sollice: @91Niki I just don't know what to do with the game. I REALLY enjoy it. And I can go hours with no issues then I get a crash and it keeps crashing. I think they have some sort of client to server issue.
[2:55:37] JaMinky: eziest pet lol
[2:55:47] ReinaldoNS: you can mount now
[2:55:51] ReinaldoNS: LUL
[2:56:00] 91Niki: @Sollice That really sucks. Hopefully it is something that will get fixed soon
[2:56:04] astranna: he has like warrior "im out of rage" voice line
[2:56:09] aid280: Do you think wow's dying out
[2:56:15] Marmoh: Drain him daddy
[2:56:37] Sollice: I dunno they have pivoted to the inventory bug as its primary fix...Which they should. Gear disappearing in a looter game is the worst thing ever
[2:56:45] ReinaldoNS: "wow dying out" LUL
[2:56:51] casualfury: LUL
[2:56:59] davzzler: @aid280 wow is 2 old to just die. But the MMO genre is, new ones doesnt have it easy
[2:57:04] 91Niki: @Sollice Especially when they don't replace the loot you had :/ Kinda like wow with the restore option
[2:57:08] JaMinky: gotta hit the hourly quota of "is wow dying/dead" question
[2:57:23] Yagr6: i prefered WoD to this
[2:57:39] Darthyrevan: thank god for TBCC
[2:57:42] Sollice: Yea wont be a one to one on the loot. But for me its fine. I got gear wiped at level 21. I don't need that gear anyways. So I didn't get it too bad
[2:57:44] casualfury: this expac a bit messy
[2:57:44] Creesy69: same @Raijuu88
[2:57:59] aid280: You hear that chat, a decent answer.
[2:58:07] 91Niki: @Sollice yeah it's worse when you're max level and super decked out
[2:58:11] davzzler: at least i can play wow and FFXIV at the same time
[2:58:33] Cafe0le: i dont want any grind in my game jsutto play arenas
[2:58:40] Rane_Tehp: I couldn't finish the campaign because a fucking quest is bugged .-.

[2:59:27] Motivess: it's a private server for wrath
[2:59:37] Yagr6: the need to go back to class fantasy like the order halls of legion and tone down the borrowed power stuff
[2:59:38] magemaster225: its still stygia its just easily farmable without the yee
[2:59:40] magemaster225: eye*

[3:01:00] ceranac23: anima power boss pog

[3:01:05] ObanXIV: but havent seen it on the site - that was just on the live stream
[3:01:16] RobNXS: Is any mount allowed in the Maw or only if you've unlocked the Maw Walker?
[3:01:24] Rane_Tehp: yep
[3:01:29] Yagr6: the problem i have so far with the game is when i play my shaman i feel like a vampire and i dont really care for that

[3:38:43] Mecabeast: I get a feeling that we are getting a bunch of aoe fights next raid
[3:38:47] othraerir: towSalt
[3:38:56] Lincoln_WoW: i mean, you get a 2nd or 3rd potency in the new soulbind stuff so you would use it -- so yes, its a nerf

[3:40:06] thrillersan: venari?
[3:40:15] hypedrobot: check the small dude
[3:40:18] duncon: RIP everyone's FPS if that is the case.
[3:40:31] Mecabeast: yeah the way the dungeon journal reads seems to point towards aoe where nathria was a bit more st focused
[3:40:57] TexValhalla: fps? lol it can't be any worse than the sire fight now LUL
[3:41:29] duncon: true @GrittyTexan that's what i'm worried about. hope every fight isn't that bad.
[3:41:37] Bombayshow: I just hope I dont have to change covenant for the new raid ...
[3:41:52] raldrik: That many more slots they better give us more conduit energy
[3:42:04] riftplaya4ever: you missed that quest
[3:42:11] TexValhalla: @duncon he means it will be an aoe fight for us, not the bosses themself, it'll be fine if that's the case
[3:42:14] Hallwack: @Towelliee is it 3 potency conduits slots now?
[3:42:56] Mecabeast: any updates on professions or could that be a 9.1.5/9.2 thing
[3:43:03] FinkTV: is eluvi hard to set up?
[3:43:18] connnelkiely: do you use plater @Towelliee
[3:43:59] Lincoln_WoW: because the cooldown on weapons is double
[3:44:01] Lincoln_WoW: its the same DPS
[3:44:25] leonavia23: Where can I get his elvui profile??

[3:47:30] Bombayshow: idk I had to farm it all again when I wanted condemn
[3:47:44] Srdjan91: or remove conduit energy completly
[3:47:49] duncon: ^^
[3:47:50] GhostFace_23: your choice wouldn't be meaninfull enough Kappa
[3:48:54] soysos91: the unlocks won’t be for weeks apart per soulbind right? like it unlocks with renown I think? but i think they should get rid of conduit energy; seems unnecessary
[3:49:49] falldrgn: onypony!
[3:49:56] SonofHorus82: towOny Onyyyyyyyyyyyy!!! towOny
[3:50:06] deathstriker99: to be honest they dont NEED to add more renown for all the conduits stop at 34
[3:50:17] deathstriker99: so they can make u just go all the way to 40 for the newer ones
[3:50:38] boosterfighterirl: n
[3:50:42] spekktrum19: Renown goes up to 80 now right? I hope they lift the cap on renown per week to 3 or 4 cause taking 5 months to get max renown again is going to suck
[3:50:52] Lincoln_WoW: it's random, it can be applied to anything in AoE
[3:51:17] deathstriker99: thats rediculous..
[3:51:18] Lincoln_WoW: that trait isn't 5%. its 3% because its weighted
[3:51:25] deathstriker99: inc like nother 5 months of work per toon
[3:51:32] Lincoln_WoW: you get 1% for 3s, 2% for 3s, etc.
[3:51:35] boosterfighterirl: towSalt
[3:51:44] spekktrum19: Literally 20 weeks to get from 40-80 renown lawl
[3:51:45] MXes: Hello
[3:51:46] casualfury: alt friendly expac LUL
[3:51:57] dotworx: there is not much power increase so far
[3:52:05] casualfury: Ion trolling again
[3:52:05] Thoreya: the biggest lie: alt friendliness
[3:52:18] Bombayshow: its fucking crazy ... I had to switch covenant for codemn and it takes so much time and anima ... I just cant stand this
[3:52:23] dotworx: conduits are so frikin weak
[3:52:27] lekkahdh: once 1 character surpasses that yes I agree
[3:52:47] SilkeySmooth: timtime engagement equals subs
[3:52:53] dotworx: sould binds are weak too
[3:53:00] crawcook: No way they will do that. They got to keep us grinding as much as possible. :(
[3:53:01] zarod89: 1-40 only takes like 2 weeks now so there probably will be some sort of catchup
[3:53:13] Bombayshow: Just give all covenant abilities to everyone and make them chose ...
[3:53:19] Keinos9300: can you please show WW pvp talents, none Is showing them
[3:53:22] Philosa_Raptor: the renown grind really is pretty quick, you do a couple LFR runs or some M+s and then you get the rest through the campaign
[3:53:30] Bombayshow: 2 weeks im not even near to where I was before switching covenant
[3:53:37] IverCold: @Towelliee What do u think come first - tbc or 9.1 ?
[3:53:39] Bombayshow: Im maldling
[3:53:49] Philosa_Raptor: being able to skip the campaign if you've done it before on another character would be nice
[3:53:52] rizey1: you made that sound soo angelic lol
[3:54:02] Meta_meme: Meta_meme subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:54:07] spekktrum19: @philosa_raptor truth
[3:54:15] MindGames_187: u can get 40 in 2 days if u try
[3:54:23] zarod89: ye you get a ton of each raid difficulty
[3:54:23] Bombayshow: problem is group looking your IO . and if you dont have the right covenant well they just dont take you
[3:54:37] dotworx: he starts new maw campaing
[3:54:40] Lincoln_WoW: maybe he adds renown
[3:54:43] r0b0tak0s: KEKW
[3:54:53] Philosa_Raptor: at the higher key levels year @Bombayshow I havent ran into that doing lower keys though but im not a big key pusher

[3:55:29] casualfury: @Lincoln_WoW same

[3:55:41] mitakashi: ohh no
[3:56:01] Bombayshow: last raid is always the best one
[3:56:02] Philosa_Raptor: I think thats just people thinking the cov choice makes a huge difference in DPS, it may have early on but now its pretty close honestly
[3:56:09] Philosa_Raptor: depends on the spec though I guess and the class
[3:56:18] Chimp458: lol make IO standard from everyone .... what could go wrong
[3:56:22] Lincoln_WoW: he doesn't add renown. i just checked on a character with low renown
[3:56:27] Lincoln_WoW: he doesn't do anything
[3:56:27] xExilicx: u think dh is better or monk for dps in new season?
[3:56:35] deathstriker99: its more the utility that each cov brings than anything else
[3:56:43] casualfury: perfect
[3:56:49] deathstriker99: io standard = ur better off making ur own key runs with friends
[3:57:02] Bombayshow: I hope they call it in game Gearscore LUL
[3:57:07] Lincoln_WoW: they need to weight the scores by affixes / week
[3:57:12] dotworx: i think blizz can come up with a better one
[3:57:14] Lincoln_WoW: its the only way to improve scoring
[3:57:14] spekktrum19: Blizz makes me laugh because for years they have been leaning more and more towards the “casual” player aka someone who does not play every day/raid at a high level but by having the restrictions in place for renown/anima, it makes a casual player less likely to want to play the game if it literally takes months and months to get up to a “baseline” level of being able to do the new content
[3:57:18] Arkenskjold: Blizzard going all in on raider io, just makes me not want to come back
[3:57:25] liberategeorge: separating scores by affix would make it more meaningful
[3:57:25] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:57:28] dotworx: the delay on update is a bitch for sure
[3:57:28] SilkeySmooth: players will still use raider io they are to used to it
[3:57:35] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Lamspread (warning)
[3:57:41] Bombayshow: Raider.io can be great... until you comeback in the halfway of an expention and no one want to take you cause you are 0/0 normal
[3:57:41] Enigmio: it is bad for the WoW community as a whole
[3:57:44] Reklusion: Mostly people who dont try to increase theirs so get declined xD
[3:57:48] elchaposkjelbo: hate it because people nowadays want u to have 2k+ rio KSM to complete a +8 key
[3:57:59] ceranac23: MMO champion lmao
[3:58:04] ice_ross: i prefer my info from nathria general chat
[3:58:06] Spaede: weekly no leavers HATE raiderio lol
[3:58:08] deathstriker99: well y use new when ud have to lvl up the score all again
[3:58:12] yunggooda: I just hope they find a way to integrate leaver penalties in M+ i've had too many toxic assholes in +14's that just leave
[3:58:12] Jango_: MMO Champion contains the saltiest fucks you will ever encounter
[3:58:13] Lamspread: got timed out for trying to say Rio but spelled out?
[3:58:28] Sovekz: Have 1.5k rio and I hate that shit, had to raise it just to get any invites
[3:58:37] Reklusion: Forgot MMO even existed..
[3:58:42] SonofHorus82: how do I check my Raider.io in game? Or do I have to actually have done something that matters to Raider.io first?
[3:58:43] Bombayshow: this dude probably loves covid LUL

[3:59:17] TheCliffyShow: Some people just want to watch the world burn.
[3:59:21] Araphas: True
[3:59:25] deathstriker99: it needs to tho
[3:59:38] Ryukotsu: Needing a 2kio for a +8 lul thats messed up xD
[3:59:43] filos0phia: it makes sense for them to add an MMR system to m+ imo
[3:59:45] dotworx: we will defo use rio but update possibility is good
[3:59:49] Phob0slol: @Towelliee  Just do m+ 4Head
[3:59:55] pavepawns: a man with intellect made a post. da hell?

[4:00:50] dotworx: that red stuff in beginning
[4:00:53] Wcvechten: I'm pretty sure she always had it
[4:00:55] dotworx: flew in to her
[4:01:01] elchaposkjelbo: @Towelliee tryna not spoil here, but have you seen the model for the Primus? He lookin sick
[4:01:10] casualfury: I guess this is a e sport game now
[4:01:10] Bombayshow: she always had that I think
[4:01:15] dotworx: no no
[4:01:20] Wcvechten: datamined model was empty, ingame not

[4:01:28] Araphas: Wasn't it just hollow in the beta?

[4:04:21] jasperboy: I've been rolled by him once in TC 6
[4:04:25] gazaway: My hunter did
[4:04:43] Molvonos: Only time i've seen him was when he was part of the background on a merchant level
[4:04:54] Chrissfrosty: damn 7 adds in a roll
[4:05:15] 91Niki: @Molvonos Yeah exactly. and if you walk up to it, it stomps the ground. and i got knocked back 🤷
[4:05:26] Wcvechten: I'd have a good time if we just cleared trash to the boss and we get anima powers for just that fight
[4:05:43] Molvonos: @91Niki lol I just flipped him off and let him have his tantrum
[4:05:43] pavepawns: at 10% its run for your life or die vs terragrue

[4:06:19] Molvonos: @91Niki At least until I teabag him after killing him for the week.
[4:06:48] Crisis88: @Towelliee Sounds like ghosts or a wall in the fight to have the chains hit first.
[4:06:48] j_bar111: Does it stun the boss?
[4:06:49] panzmat: is loot ILVL known?
[4:06:56] 91Niki: @Molvonos When you come back in chat and complain you got one shot. don't say i didn't told you so LUL haha

[4:21:28] Molvonos: rofl, We Heros of the Storm no
[4:21:29] Molvonos: now.
[4:21:34] pavepawns: depends on the casttime
[4:21:39] TexValhalla: bruh
[4:21:50] TexValhalla: people gonna get like 50 of them stacks and just insta die
[4:21:59] Bombayshow: it would be great if there is a phase that she instantly recruit everyone who went on the loyalist questline in bfa
[4:22:04] Bombayshow: LUL
[4:22:04] Molvonos: Bet that Withering Fire spreads

[4:22:43] taveerah: please let us kill sylvanis, I'm so tired of her
[4:22:54] pavepawns: i think its gonna like the blackrock caverns chaim boss
[4:22:57] pavepawns: chain*
[4:23:01] ZeethianDragon: I just want to kill her already. No redemption arc bs
[4:23:08] alundrius: so thats how you clear the bleed
[4:23:09] TheCliffyShow: @MrMontte Blasphemy!

[4:23:50] Lulaboo: I will break my mouse if Silvanas gets redeemed
[4:24:02] TexValhalla: stage three is literally called the freedom of choice
[4:24:04] ZeethianDragon: I'm pretty much done with the game if she gets one
[4:24:10] TexValhalla: reedam arc confirmed KEKW

[4:25:12] TexValhalla: so it truly wouldn't surprise me if she gets some sort of reedem arc
[4:25:13] TheCliffyShow: She's not gonna die here. They have been teasing a redemption since this expansion began.

[4:27:09] alex12645: oh great warlocks aoe time

[4:35:53] filos0phia: he made a deal to look into the shadowlands so they gave it to him but took control of the eye away from him

[5:34:10] deathstriker99: only pvers taht need to pvp farm is tanks for the vers and haste sets
[5:34:23] Sagevaulk: Sagevaulk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[5:34:34] dotworx: hes right but what does he expect?
[5:34:36] RhadigarTV: Is that so wrong though?
[5:34:39] JeemTeam: hasnt that always been the issue

[5:34:47] Thoreya: i mean..it was like that in 8.3 for my fire mage
[5:34:49] RhadigarTV: I mean, that's what it was like back in Classic wasn't it?
[5:34:51] zoovthepally: Most classes have to already
[5:34:59] deathstriker99: get rid of vers it solves it all
[5:34:59] Thoreya: mastery/crit vs vers/haste lol
[5:35:05] dotworx: ull be smashed
[5:35:15] Ziktus: That's the drawback, but without scaling ilvls you'd have to do both PvP and PvE too since there is a bit of overlap in gear used in PvP and PvE.
[5:35:18] porowozek: if you do all that you probably have time to gear twice
[5:35:20] dotworx: no vers factor is big
[5:35:28] Lacermane: You'd have a lot less verse compared to a PvP geared player
[5:35:43] deathstriker99: haste... vers
[5:35:58] brewsephtv: Most tanks want vers/haste
[5:36:05] Pannekaker: Luckily there's some good Vers/Haste gear in the next raid
[5:36:12] Aakku: warrior too
[5:36:21] deathstriker99: maybe so panne but withiout that vers before next raid ur not gonna be great
[5:36:44] brewsephtv: They should just not make vers the pvp stat
[5:37:08] deathstriker99: they shoiuld just get rid of vers and add pvp power back on pvp gear and that will solve it all
[5:37:24] Aakku: not just that but also Shammies, WW and Havoc want verse, you basically funnel all them to pvp

[5:37:44] Reklusion: You dont use abilities when your invisible @Towelliee  D
[5:38:01] soysos91: maybe it's not a problem but a solution; bc you'll have more "content"
[5:38:06] deathstriker99: then it makes it seem more like a job than anything for enjoyment
[5:38:08] soysos91: just another side
[5:38:12] dotworx: crybabies, thats not a problem if u want to do both put the time in for both
[5:38:46] Ziktus: As it is, you'd have to do both even if you're just into PvE. So it makes more sense to let people that want to do both actually do both, and no the other way around.
[5:38:52] deathstriker99: is why dot i say change vers to pvp power and get rid of vers and then look for anotehr 2ndaryt stat from pve and then ur goochi and pvp' can pvp and those that just wanna pve can pve
[5:38:58] warrenny: Eye of the jailor still in 9.1?

[5:40:29] Holysal: stygia is for season 1 only
[5:40:49] dotworx: resiliance was the best solution to seperate pvp pve
[5:40:50] longdongliam_: bring back set bonuses and pvp set bonuses
[5:40:54] eaglegoboom: it was super bugged yesterday

[5:41:27] zoovthepally: @enigmio worried that arcane nf might be really good and going venth would stop me from playing that
[5:41:41] deathstriker99: to fix one bug one must create more bugs
[5:41:49] elandura: most people don't see that they have to use EAB on this quest
[5:41:53] Malarick: Clowney to the Browns.  1yr 10mm
[5:41:56] lithium364: i like how odyn doesnt even talk with us about freeing the last god

[5:42:44] deathstriker99: mody athletes are not worth there paychecks these days
[5:42:48] brewsephtv: I think Clowney is a solid rotational guy, but he's never lived up to the hype
[5:43:01] spainard15: dude is a troll
[5:43:02] TheNightrider: Clownman is super overhyped
[5:43:09] NetherRegion: He gets pressures, not sacks
[5:43:12] SonofHorus82: about 5 mil more than that gooch is worth.
[5:43:13] zoovthepally: But totally could see Ballard offering 5
[5:43:31] Poriand: whats this for in ptr?
[5:43:34] Holysal: he will have Myles to make his life easier
[5:43:39] TyndiVelspaz: clowney had what, one highlight from college when he jumped the snap?
[5:43:58] brewsephtv: Ballard is a solid GM unlike Howie dorkiMonkaS
[5:43:59] eaglegoboom: his deal
[5:44:01] eaglegoboom: $6.25 million signing bonus $5.25M base salary (guaranteed) $1.5M in per-game active bonuses  $500K for 75% playtime  $250K for 75% playtime + playoffs $250K for Pro Bowl $1M for 10 sacks  Base value $13M. Max $15M

[5:44:31] Enigmio: @Poriand part of jailers eye questline
[5:45:19] TyndiVelspaz: NFL contracts confuse the fuck out of me. Just go the way of the NHL a
[5:45:37] hgizaira: this quest style is so overused now
[5:45:38] TyndiVelspaz: and make the caphit off the base guarantee
[5:45:50] TheGaoSora: RPers complained
[5:45:54] elandura: if it's more like a disturbance, as opposed to being fun, it has to go tho.
[5:46:01] SonofHorus82: damn we're getting to mount up and not give a shit about the jailer anymore. Maybe the Maw will be worth visiting now.
[5:46:17] Breeni: it never really worked though, wasnt actually dangerous
[5:46:34] warrenny: Ppl cried blizz removed
[5:46:41] Ticklemepls: what is this place? @Towelliee
[5:47:06] Ziktus: Sounds like a lot of things blizzard does. Not do anything with the feedback they get and stand their ground, only to go back and change it a patch or 2 later :P
[5:47:12] itjustfeelsright: wouldnt you still want stygia for the sockets?
[5:47:13] pavepawns: that bar takes a while sadly
[5:47:17] pbnj_kills: they should let us spend stygia to get soul ash since we dont need it in 9.1
[5:47:36] spainard15: Wouldn't Odin Counter the jailer?!
[5:47:51] beckett3a: smaller than broken shore?
[5:48:10] eaglegoboom: no
[5:48:40] ZeethianDragon: "landmass"
