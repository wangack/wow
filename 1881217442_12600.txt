[5:53:17] Montius23: Tribute is amazing if ur a seasoned ccg enjoyer
[5:53:22] Montius23: Prob better than legends
[5:53:35] Maelstromboli: More similar to teamfight tactics than hearthstone
[5:54:09] LeafyGreeens: @Montius23 thanks I really enjoyed Legends with it's two lane approach but it lost support
[5:56:45] FruckAwesome: Just the tip?
[5:56:45] Maelstromboli: They recently increased melee range, yeah
[5:57:08] Montius23: Np @leafygreeens I can't give an expert opinion on ESL but I've played almost every ccg in existence and Tales of Tribute ranks up near the top. I just hope it stays popular

[5:59:03] Montius23: End game gearing is pretty convenient compared to most mmo.. u just farm tier sets and they stay bis for very long time
[6:00:09] aKy0001: yeah, you can even have a very long break and your gear would still be viable when logging back in
[6:00:37] crzyblue: I'm curious what add-ins he uses for ESO
[6:02:16] Sollice: Sounds like a D4 gem problem
[6:02:49] Sollice: It's actually really bad to hear from Blizzard that bag space is such a technical detail because of the nature of the multiple players per shard kind of thing

[6:03:41] Sollice: @Heero_Effect Yeah for sure thats what we want them to be
[6:04:43] Montius23: Ya inventory management is rough. Sometimes they give a free month of premium so u can obtain the big mats bag. But other than that u gotta sell and delete a lot of items
