[2:46:33] GamerKillance: SWTOR first two months was great. Then it fell off due to LACK of content and a CRAP TON of bugs
[2:46:39] Anzel_1: No TearGlove TearGlove
[2:46:42] GamerKillance: F2P within 7 months lol
[2:46:47] belfastcl: that's on an island that unlocks while you do the main quest
[2:46:53] MILESkg21: nothing like gettin stun locked in HUTTBALL KEKW
[2:46:58] Anzel_1: I think it's below
[2:47:02] Loonytic: @mileskg21 i did content for tgn on swtor launch it was some of the funnest time until we all when back to wow 4 months later lol
[2:47:03] Kurtzia: bottom right island
[2:47:08] GamerKillance: You still get stun locked in huttball lol
[2:47:17] Loonytic: ^
[2:47:18] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it opens with the main questline
[2:47:22] mayhemguy: yeah you just take a shit
[2:47:24] Kurtzia: its part of the story
[2:47:30] MILESkg21: Loonytic i wish swtor had lasted longer
[2:47:46] GamerKillance: I wish a lot of MMO's lasted longer
[2:47:54] Koolsouthpaw: SWTOR just released an expansion
[2:47:58] GamerKillance: A handful still going with a population

[2:48:10] Anzel_1: @MilesKG21 im pretty sure swtor still has a dedicated fanbase.
[2:48:11] adxx: more like an update for SWTOR, not an xpac
[2:48:15] GamerKillance: And the SWTOR expansion fell on its face for being 1 hour of content
[2:48:33] Koolsouthpaw: @GamerKillance oof...
[2:48:38] metal_yoda: I played SWTOR last year, lots of players still. Never had a problem getting groups AND I wasn't even Sith lol
[2:48:52] Tecni: was it also a year for Wildstar to go free?
[2:48:53] GamerKillance: Well ya they switched to steam last year
[2:48:55] 4eignnn: god i miss swtor
[2:49:00] GamerKillance: That jumped them in population
[2:49:06] fred_birkhoff: dude, it would be really cool if WoW went at least partly free to play. like if they let you play free, no sub, till right before last expansion
[2:49:12] xCuzo: Lugtread subscribed with Prime. 
[2:49:18] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the latest xpac literally fell down face first lol XD for SWTOR
[2:49:29] xCuzo: towHAMUP

[2:50:22] GamerKillance: Just a stupid instance
[2:50:27] CasTV: what expansion was wow in when swtor first released
[2:50:36] GamerKillance: Cata
[2:50:37] Kooznik: @Towelliee Kind of shocked there were no Jailer nerfs for today with the cross realm mythic opening up
[2:50:40] ImpulsiveGamerx: cata
[2:50:40] 91Niki: I was waiting for Cohh to play, but he's off for lunch i think?
[2:50:45] Rottencoarse: after they announced the release date they delayed it XD @Towelliee
[2:50:49] Loonytic: do you still get paid for your content at tgn? @towelliee - i got a few videos one with close to a million views and stopped being paid a long time ago
[2:51:04] Rottencoarse: @91Niki  he's playing the new wh40 k game i believe
[2:51:18] 91Niki: @Rottencoarse His title said V Rising later ðŸ¤·
[2:51:18] MILESkg21: wtf KEKW
[2:51:22] mayhemguy: my long neck
[2:51:27] Rottencoarse: aah
[2:51:31] MILESkg21: sure this isnt the alpha test
[2:51:56] adxx: this is a PS2 game from 2004
[2:52:01] GamerKillance: Looks boring
[2:52:02] yuvalal: something special today beside the vault ?
[2:52:15] After43ver: pre alpha
[2:52:22] adxx: runescape 2.0 with vampire dlc
[2:52:25] Broomba: this early early access has more content than AoC
[2:52:35] 91Niki: Wut
[2:52:36] After43ver: lol runescape
[2:52:46] 91Niki: Shots fired
[2:53:02] 91Niki: I'll wait and hear Cohhs thought about it before I buy
[2:53:13] K4ykay: v risking huh
[2:53:14] adxx: I think the Early Access approach has destroyed more games than helped them. just my opinion outside of a few standouts
[2:53:15] fred_birkhoff: dude, ashes of creation, surprisingly accurate name it's "ASHES of creation" Kappa
[2:53:49] TrixStar36: I want a MMO set in the supernatural universe so bad lol
[2:54:02] Broomba: hype -- this is the next wow killer KEKW
[2:54:03] ZeusDNA: It's like lost ark, minus the lost ark
[2:54:05] dutchie76: LUL
[2:54:06] fred_birkhoff: lol, it's jank af
[2:54:13] dutchie76: what game is that?
[2:54:22] Deadcells: Big no for me
[2:54:30] GamerKillance: I personally waiting on the third region of New genesis PSO2 next month
[2:54:30] After43ver: how the mobile game?
[2:54:31] xJetlifee: @Towelliee about how long you think till they reboot brother?
[2:54:39] fred_birkhoff: LUL

[2:55:13] MILESkg21: silently waiting for POE 2
[2:55:15] Short_Film: @Towelliee you pumped for Top Gun?
[2:55:22] 91Niki: I hope by the time I get my laptop in the US it will be better. Cuz I will rage quit so hard otherwise KEKW
[2:55:24] fred_birkhoff: it's so overrated. i used to play it in like 2010 .... it was good back then
[2:55:29] 91Niki: Nerfs to mobs
[2:55:32] xJetlifee: you ever played warframe ? @Towelliee
[2:55:35] fred_birkhoff: these days ... ugggh ... click fest ... nothing going on
[2:55:38] nouwandhi: Path of Exile is a great game
[2:55:55] fred_birkhoff: to each their own @nouwandhi
[2:56:04] SaichotickEQ: Did you have your mouse and keyboard plugged in at the start? ;)
[2:56:07] nouwandhi: not brainless easy like wow
[2:56:11] joe_g_433: Hey @towelliee whatâ€™s the mythic prog lookin like?
[2:56:19] nokster: @fred_birkhoff poe launched in 2013 but you played it in 2010 ok boomer
[2:56:22] Deadcells: @towelliee Iâ€™ve done that 10 times. I install game die uninstall and try again 3 months later and do it again.
[2:56:26] LadyJasmin: LadyJasmin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[2:56:34] MILESkg21: 39 YEARS towHAMUP
[2:56:34] xJetlifee: brainless??? run a 20+
[2:56:40] fred_birkhoff: idk, i said in "like" 2010. i used to play it back when it wasn't popular @nokster
[2:56:43] 91Niki: @Towelliee It's because the rare mobs have the modifiers from previous league. and then if you have a sentinel modifier too, it just broke some of the mobs lol
[2:56:44] Broomba: @Deadcells referring to PoE?
[2:56:45] LadyJasmin: you're welcome
[2:56:48] Favren: why the servers are down?
[2:56:58] xJetlifee: @Favren ^^^ ?
[2:57:00] callmestray: @Favren weekly maintenance
[2:57:19] fred_birkhoff: i was playing it when each loading screen took like 2 minutes ... and back then it was good. this days it's terrible ... such a mindless dumb game ... IMO
[2:57:20] MILESkg21: KEKW
[2:57:21] dutchie76: damn servers not up yet? LUL
[2:57:23] Loonytic: later bro hope u have a good day and stream!
[2:57:26] phavens: @Towelliee I'm burned out on Lost Ark playing a bunch of characters, should I try New World or FF for a more traditional MMO?
[2:57:38] GamerKillance: Nah screw all these MMO's Maplestory is where its at
[2:57:39] xJetlifee: @callmestray how long that usually last shit i guess i usually sleep through it
[2:57:43] GamerKillance: scottfPlush
[2:57:44] Broomba: @phavens try both
[2:57:45] 91Niki: So the game needs a lot of balancing with the old and the new system. Which I am sure the devs are all over. POE devs are god tier devs when it comes to being on top of fixing and patching games
[2:57:48] fred_birkhoff: these*
[2:57:56] dutchie76: try Archeage Kapa
[2:58:01] dutchie76: lol
[2:58:10] KingSlayerYotam: @GamerKillance if nexon will make a 0.42 "classic" server ill be all over that
[2:58:10] MILESkg21: u mean Fishing Sim KEKW
[2:58:16] phavens: I've put tons of hours into ESO, loved it. I quit when they removed proc sets.
[2:58:32] portend: EverQuest is still going strong, 28 expansions later. BloodTrail
[2:58:44] Zavier420: Quin is always playing POE
[2:58:53] giggz91: What affix are this week?
[2:58:54] GamerKillance: Then everquest 2 fell hard
[2:58:56] GamerKillance: Lol
[2:59:10] GamerKillance: scottfLimit scottfPlush
[2:59:12] Deadcells: Diablo 3 is 10 years old wtf happened
[2:59:14] Jehkt: Chair, chair, chair. We meet again.
[2:59:27] metal_yoda: @Deadcells lol right?
[2:59:28] sp1cythiccboi: @Zavier420 reliable zdps quinrat lmao
[2:59:28] adelius3: i love when streamers leave this screen open, it means I dont have to :D
[2:59:39] MILESkg21: and to think we only ever got 1 expansion for D3 KEKW
[2:59:50] Zavier420: @bulllitt19 lol
[2:59:57] GamerKillance: They gave up on D3 so hard after it flopped post year 21
[2:59:57] metal_yoda: crusader <3
[3:00:01] GamerKillance: year 1*
[3:00:04] itsDaegaron: GhostieSloth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! hi dad
[3:00:35] Velashen: Yeah they canned an expansion that was supposedly almost done.
[3:00:57] 91Niki: Diablo 3 is still fun to play during seasons. But it just feels kinda like useless rewards, cuz they won't carry over to D4. Unlike POE, everything you get there, will carry over to POE 2
[3:00:58] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || PRE-ALPHA Exclusive Gameplay - Ni No Kuni: Cross Worlds (Systems and Mechanics) youtu.be/RFyUOgYN0ak
[3:01:17] GamerKillance: After all Diablo 3 must be a great game with the original director saying "fuck that loser" to the diablo 2 director for criticism
[3:02:06] warrenny: @gamerkillance So devs cant xall out idiots?
[3:02:12] Velashen: Yeah screw D3. Game was on life support from the start. Tons of features that never made it.

[3:03:52] GamerKillance: You mean shoving away criticism by the director from a vastly superior and more popular game than Diablo 3? There is a difference between that and it showed a major lack of respect. Jay Wilson was forced by Blizzard to apologize
[3:04:05] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:04:07] MILESkg21: some people made full time jobs out of it
[3:04:20] xXSiebzehnXx: Only when i sit here and wait for it LUL
[3:04:32] portend: It worked out well to a point.
[3:04:35] MILESkg21: must be a helluva patch today Kappa
[3:05:19] GamerKillance: But that only takes a small amount of money for seasons. They hardly put any effort into it
[3:05:21] Mech3003: probly getting the server rdy for crossfaction  soon :p

[3:06:06] 91Niki: I'll be 40 by the time we see D4 at this point
[3:06:11] Wallusss: They actually just added a new game mode to D3 this past season
[3:06:38] Othos545: Really hoping that I can get my hunter pet >.>
[3:06:44] MILESkg21: 91Niki that means i'll be 50 LuL
[3:06:44] GamerKillance: Ya they kinda scrapped most of the content for Diablo 3 before the first expansion even came out. Diablo 3 didn't do well post launch
[3:07:04] TheCliffyShow: I was hoping to squeeze in a quick mythic plus when servers come back up before reset. But, that's not happening now.
[3:07:23] 91Niki: It's okay, as long as it comes out before Kingdom Hearts 4, we're good Kappa
[3:07:27] Leeroypaxton: any release date or beta news on arclight?
[3:07:37] GamerKillance: I mean KH4 was announced this time soooo
[3:07:40] adxx: whats up with pantheon? when does that beta come out damnit
[3:07:49] GamerKillance: Not like KH3 where it took a deacde to be announced lol
[3:07:54] GamerKillance: Decade*

[3:08:21] Kooznik: @Towelliee surprised there are no jailer nerfs on heroic today? With the cross server mythic opening up and the low amount of Heroic Jailer kills all around?
[3:08:30] fred_birkhoff: diablo 2?
[3:08:32] mrrazputin: GTA
[3:08:33] Yrdehn: sims

[3:08:50] vadder_fister: metal gear rising revengeance
[3:08:50] GamerKillance: 10 years before
[3:08:51] fred_birkhoff: lol
[3:08:52] common_taco: Sims is a hit

[3:09:02] adxx: MINECRAFT lol
[3:09:18] amricatt: wow
[3:09:23] GamerKillance: So ya it took a decade for KH3 to be announced like I said
[3:09:26] 91Niki: @GamerKillance Kingdom Hearts 3 got its first teaser in 2013, released in 2019. Yeah we ain't seeing 4 for a looong time LUL
[3:09:29] adxx: that doesnt surpirse me but not as #1 thats crazy
[3:09:40] Zavier420: A lot of Blizzard games on that list
[3:10:04] Velashen: And yet they didn't see it fit to release the second expansion. NotLikeThis
[3:10:30] MILESkg21: like people buying GTA 5 for every platform 4Head
[3:10:36] GamerKillance: Im just saying it took a decade for an announcement of KH3 to even happen. I wasn't wrong on that. Don't be so cynical lol. Square Enix currently can't risk waiting forever on releases with how red in the water they are

[3:11:17] common_taco: yeah they yeeted it pretty quick
[3:11:23] FergusCreative: yea it was only there for like what 6 months? It was funny hearing people paying rent with it
[3:11:26] portend: Could ask ZillianOP Kappa
[3:11:31] Velashen: Completely redid the loot system.

[4:29:32] Typical_Cats: that would be nice
[4:29:57] G00dLuck_: do you believe that one year without new raid will keep the crowd till dragonflight?
[4:30:02] Complete_Phased: My one hope is that they will just remove loot lockouts from legacy dungeons and raids. Like why is there still a weekly lockout for look on Black Temple
[4:30:09] Deadcells: Because they want the pain
[4:30:42] Koolsouthpaw: i REALLY hope rep becomes acct wide
[4:30:49] Complete_Phased: @G00dLuck_ they dont need to stay they just need to come back
[4:31:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Complete_Phased That sounds fine with me, there's no good reason to have lockouts if those old raids don't drop anything useable now....let the transmog and mount farmers have at it
[4:31:21] Complete_Phased: @sunnydains that just means there is a fundamental problem with the game at that point
[4:32:38] Thoreya: ^ and what is the fundamental problem exactly? farming is half the battle in an mmo

[4:34:22] Plague_GG: double surv Pog
[4:34:28] Koolsouthpaw: 4 piece on ret pally is bananas for damage and tempest leggo
[4:34:37] Malnar1123: There's no reason Bear tartar can't work like it used to in old raids/dungeons as well
[4:35:05] Sesspai: if it's the same one i have, it puts icons on the map
[4:37:12] theDirtyon3: some classes still cant solo guldan on mythic KEKW
[4:37:24] Shirey36: stil not 1 shotable
[4:37:54] Mecabeast: can we even solo bfa content yet?
[4:38:01] theDirtyon3: no
[4:38:15] Plague_GG: next expac we should
[4:38:23] theDirtyon3: Bfa will be soloable next xpac hopefully
[4:38:58] Khooya_: legion does have some kind of legacy damage, but it's a different multiplier than wod
[4:39:01] Plague_GG: legacy loot sucks. quit giving me useless artifact relics
[4:39:36] theDirtyon3: yeah their scaling is still a bit off
[4:39:48] Shirey36: bliz just dont know how to scale properly
[4:40:00] theDirtyon3: @plague_seraph legacy is good they just need to take relics out of the loot pool
[4:40:02] soysos91: why do they care
[4:40:11] Zettabyte: But my Legion experience, @Towelliee Kappa
[4:40:46] LJimbox: anyone know if you convert a non-set raid gear. into raid gear. can you 'upgrade it' to increase its ilvl? similar to how the m+ upgrades work
[4:40:47] jaykodiak: is mage tower scaled up if you go back and do it now?
[4:41:14] Plague_GG: @theDirtyon3 it would be better if I could collect transmog for lesser armor. like if i'm plate i can collect all armor transmog, but that would be too op i guess
[4:41:33] Malnar1123: @jaykodiak your gear is scaled down to iLvL 50...some of them are arguably harder than they were even when they first came out in legion
[4:41:33] theDirtyon3: @plague_seraph that has never been how it works
[4:41:45] Plague_GG: i know
[4:41:52] Rev_4_Life: I always just pull him to the far edge of the room if its under 500k
[4:42:27] theDirtyon3: its not worth it tbh LUL
[4:42:31] Malnar1123: It took me 300 pulls to get the bear but I did it lol
[4:42:46] Hannibleking23: sup all I haven't played wow since Oct 2021 I'm kinda missing it
[4:42:47] RoboMaximillion: 291 pulls for bear
[4:42:52] Horseweave: Just how hard is the affixes this week?
[4:42:53] Koolsouthpaw: noob question:  how do you queue for mage tower?
[4:42:58] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee bragging over here.
[4:42:59] TouretterousToad: What class are you running towelie
[4:43:04] Malnar1123: @Koolsouthpaw Go to it just like you did in legion
[4:43:18] Fugazi811: @Koolsouthpaw go to the mage tower and talk to npc, free entry
[4:43:30] Koolsouthpaw: nice. thanks!
[4:44:15] Rev_4_Life: The bear was just a boomkin challenge at the start

[5:06:11] belfastcl: spawns in mid
[5:06:14] Rottencoarse: and game crash
[5:06:16] Rottencoarse: :D
[5:06:16] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[5:06:20] DeLaJestyr: and now not so much lololol
[5:06:27] EfekanDDD: and story end :D
[5:06:29] belfastcl: some do
[5:06:44] Velashen: ESO feature.
[5:07:07] vincubus: yeah i stopped playing and paying for ESO bc the dev team sucks
[5:07:17] mustiparta: You can pick it up off their corpse or itâ€™ll time out like flags in wsg
[5:07:20] belfastcl: the ball does damage to you, incrementally
[5:07:39] theDirtyon3: @vincubus no need to be rude my guy
[5:07:42] mustiparta: It ticks for progressively more dmg in an aoe
[5:07:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kicked.... PepeHands
[5:08:07] VerySneaky84: Has Lord Towelliee learned light attack weaving?
[5:08:38] vincubus: i mean the game's been out 8 years and still have random dcs
[5:08:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Light attack weaving is very important for doing max damage in ESO
[5:08:42] vincubus: and cyro is a mess
[5:08:45] belfastcl: I wonder if it's some addon causing the crashes
[5:09:14] mustiparta: Iâ€™d bet itâ€™s some addon I donâ€™t have crash issues tbh
[5:09:16] theDirtyon3: @vincubus you do realize they just made huge upgrades to their servers right?
[5:10:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Light attack weaving is a kind of animation canceling....using a light attack between every ability will spike damage way up
[5:10:12] belfastcl: @vincubus the lag is gone from cyro in pc-na
[5:10:13] theDirtyon3: weaving is animation canelling a light attack with a skill and then do that over and over again
[5:10:16] its_Xek: hows this been so ffar
[5:10:43] VerySneaky84: yeah, good dps requires good weaving, with high LA/s, approaching the 1s GCD
[5:10:51] mustiparta: Weaving is timing it like a metronome or a heart beat. Like ability, light attack, ability, light attack it takes some getting used to
[5:11:10] a_demeaning_cow: ESO is the only MMO to even remotely take my interest from WoW
[5:11:17] grandpatech: if you do a light attack you can do an ability right away and skip the light attack animation increasing your DPS
[5:11:21] belfastcl: I wouldn't worry about weaving while leveling, even less as a tank
[5:11:42] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  that's a skyshard
[5:11:44] mustiparta: Very true
[5:11:47] Rottencoarse: which u dont have
[5:12:11] grandpatech: the begining zones are good for mining

[5:13:31] VerySneaky84: you kinda roll it into the skill, like left click then skill button, ideally 1 second frequency
[5:13:35] HeatherJC83: @Towelliee if you put a skill point into KEEN EYE for woodworkings, blacksmithing, etc, you can track the mines, wood, etc bc they will glow in the world
