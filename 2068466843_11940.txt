[3:19:21] RaviFFXIV: @NarcinRoc yeah, i guess. i would just probably evaluate those cases as someone finding out that getting better at this game is not something that interests them.

[3:33:58] mobalord: recycle raids, not dungeons

[3:34:22] ÂÆà„Çä„ÅÆÁ•û: ÂÆà„Çä„ÅÆÁ•û subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[3:34:22] mobalord: so i dont care for the game
[3:34:34] Byrchi: huh? recycling dungs is way better than having the same 8 dungs for the whole expansion
[3:34:49] mobalord: they used to add new ones during the expac in legion
[3:35:01] SeriousJester: go non verbal
[3:35:04] SomeGuyNamed: Corpa üìâ reduce footprint Corpa üìâ Recycle
[3:35:13] Byrchi: Yeah they added 2 dungeons
[3:35:27] Byrchi: And now they add a megadungeon
[3:36:10] mobalord: also the removal of titanforge to mythic raiders get to keep their itemlevel advantage over keyrunners
[3:36:15] Edeslash: Legion was megadungeon + 2 but yeah since then every expac has added 1 megadungeon that gets split into 2 wings for m+
[3:36:42] Edeslash: @mobalord your takes are psychotic and show that you havent played in a long time
[3:36:54] Byrchi: @mobalord But this isn't true at all
[3:37:06] mobalord: in legion you could actually on do mythic+ and not be at a disadvantage
[3:37:12] Edeslash: Nobody wants RNG based ilvl increases, the game has an upgrade system now
[3:37:15] mobalord: now you get ONE good item per week if you only run keys
[3:37:16] Byrchi: @mobalord Yes its the same rn?
[3:37:19] Edeslash: You are not disadvantaged now
[3:37:23] mobalord: and mythic raiders get showered in gear
[3:37:27] spruudel: asmongold type chatter
[3:37:30] spruudel: Ratting
[3:37:43] niko_is_bad: He's showing how he hasn't played in a decade
[3:37:46] Edeslash: @mobalord it took me 4 weeks of mythic prog to get a single item from mythic raid
[3:37:57] mobalord: @Byrchi no, titanforge is gone, you get one decent item per week out of keys and nothing else
[3:38:11] Edeslash: The 6ilvl difference is minimal anyway and doenst impact your chance of timing keys AT ALL
[3:38:19] mobalord: the best way to play keys is one dungeon per week per class and then quit
[3:38:28] mobalord: spamming more than one key per week is almost useless
[3:38:41] Edeslash: @mobalord The wow community would get insanely mad if they reintroduced titanforging, the heavy RNG felt awful for everyone
[3:38:56] neuronutz: KEYS, KEYS, KEYS !!!  KEYS to begin the schedule. Schedule to begin the KEYS. Heros will answer with KEYS, KEYS, KEYS more KEYS!!!
[3:39:07] mobalord: ye the wow community wants dungeons to be a neglected stepchild of raiders
[3:39:12] mobalord: thats why i quit
[3:39:21] Edeslash: @mobalord If you hate running dungeons that much, why do you care? You genuinely cannot enjoy the content if that is your "optimal way to play"
[3:39:23] spruudel: HOLY Ratting
[3:39:26] Glebk0: what a moronic take lol
[3:39:36] Nokterian: WoW is fun

[3:40:21] Angeels: I love the completely deranged wow takes we get in this stream
[3:40:23] Edeslash: And m+ players would hate titanforging as much as raiders
[3:40:44] wulfgang71: does wow drive gw2 players insane?

[3:40:58] SomeGuyNamed: #gladileft

[3:41:21] Bagnasty: wow has goblins tpotCrumbled what other mmo has them‚Ä¶none
[3:41:31] Nokterian: m+ is one of the best things added since Legion i dont raid so im very happy with it
[3:41:31] wulfgang71: i just noticed the freaking in game chat is full of trees
[3:41:42] Bennybaver: unpopular opinion wtb titanforging and corruption back Chadge
[3:41:43] hysy__: xddTree
[3:41:50] mobalord: in legion, you could spam keys for one or two weeks and be geared out and never need to raid mythic
[3:41:54] SomeGuyNamed: xddTree
[3:41:54] mobalord: cause titanforge
[3:42:04] Edeslash: @mobalord YOU CAN DO THAT NOW
[3:42:10] Edeslash: xddTree
[3:42:10] Bagnasty: imagine playing the game
[3:42:17] dolordolo: mobalord is a proffesional hatewatcher, watch and learn chat Hatewatchers
[3:42:31] Edeslash: Imagine knowing anything about the game you're Chatting about
[3:42:46] Angeels: lil bro is unaware of how easy it is to gear nowadays
[3:43:03] mobalord: if you spam keys you only get 470
[3:43:09] mobalord: thats useless
[3:43:15] niko_is_bad: ?
[3:43:17] niko_is_bad: XD
[3:43:22] dolordolo: BOGGED
[3:43:33] Angeels: AINTNOWAY
[3:43:35] Edeslash: Gear acquisition from keys is SO MUCH EASIER compared to Legion and BFA
[3:43:35] SeriousJester: arms is cringe
[3:43:36] SomeGuyNamed: BOGGED just a little more
[3:43:37] Edeslash: Bro
[3:43:42] Edeslash: You have to stop chatting
[3:43:47] niko_is_bad: my mw is 486.9 with 0 mythic loot
[3:43:47] Saragoober: @mobalord HUH
[3:43:57] niko_is_bad: I guess im getting gated by mythic loot xd
[3:44:13] Edeslash: The ilvl that drops from dungeons goes to 483 btw just so you know mobalord. Vault is 489
[3:44:43] mobalord: @Edeslash so https://mythicpl.us/ is lying?
[3:44:49] Nokterian: Tyrannical bosses sometimes are the one thing that feels incredible long
[3:44:52] Edeslash: Idk what that is but yes its lyinh
[3:45:04] Angeels: m+ gear acquisition fucked my dog and killed my wife
[3:45:10] CardinalTX: imagine not having ilvl on gear.   what would people do
[3:45:16] Saragoober: @mobalord End of run loot. It can then be upgraded to 483...
[3:45:20] SeriousJester: phase 1 on farm tomorrow
[3:45:21] SeriousJester: surely
[3:45:38] Edeslash: In Legion and BFA your gear piece had to proc a 1% chance ilvl increase to even be considered for equipping. Now all you get can be easily upgraded to almost bis ilvl
[3:45:50] MightyTeaBot: Subscribe to the stream to become an epic gamer! PogChamp bit.ly/tpotSub
[3:45:50] mobalord: the upgrades are still timegated i assume so it changes nothing
[3:45:55] mobalord: but if they arent then ok
[3:46:05] mobalord: but just because it is the "joke" season
[3:46:06] SeriousJester: we bogged
[3:46:12] Bennybaver: bfa when u not getting that 1 azerite trait awaree
[3:46:20] Edeslash: They are timegated for the first 4 weeks of the season and raiders have the exact same amount of timegate
[3:46:25] Glebk0: @mobalord they arent
[3:46:40] dolordolo: Chatting
[3:46:45] Byrchi: @mobalord Its not the joke season rn?
[3:46:46] mobalord: i forgot its season 4
[3:46:51] Edeslash: @mobalord The joke season doesnt start until April btw this is a normal season
[3:46:52] Angeels: ????
[3:46:52] mobalord: but season 1 to 3 they never allow it
[3:46:53] Saragoober: @mobalord s3
[3:46:57] dolordolo: ??????????? NAURRRRRRR
[3:46:59] niko_is_bad: I like how he doesn't even know how the gearing system works in the game and keeps just making up shit
[3:47:01] Angeels: what is bro on about
[3:47:07] Byrchi: @mobalord wdym thats literally how it has been season 1,2 and 3
[3:47:12] mobalord: ye i quit in shadowlands
[3:47:17] Angeels: shadowlands had valor
[3:47:20] Angeels: like what are you on about
[3:47:29] mobalord: that was timegated except for fourth joke season
[3:47:57] Edeslash: Yes, currently the timegate applied to both raid and m+ gear because they are all in the same upgrade system
[3:48:34] mobalord: well thats still a huge raid advantage because they can drop directly on top of it
[3:48:40] Bagnasty: FEASTABLES
[3:48:50] Airu91: lviign mices dream
[3:48:54] mobalord: but thanks for clarifying that
[3:49:03] Angeels: I mean yes
[3:49:07] Angeels: whejn you play both pve gamemodes
[3:49:09] Angeels: you get more drops
[3:49:12] Angeels: just like if you only raid
[3:49:14] Angeels: you dont get m+ loot
[3:49:17] Angeels: stupid af take
[3:49:26] Saragoober: LUL
[3:49:26] mobalord: you can raid all week and do one key and get max loot
[3:49:28] Edeslash: Getting a mythic raid drop in the first 3 weeks gives you a tiny ilvl advantage which is completely meaningless in terms of your performance
[3:49:35] Angeels: what
[3:49:37] Glebk0: mr mobalord is trolling on purpose
[3:49:38] mobalord: if you key all week and do one mythic boss, you are at a huge advantage
[3:49:49] mobalord: *dis
[3:49:52] Angeels: my friend
[3:49:53] Edeslash: @mobalord All mythic raiders are literally forced to run 8 x 20 keys because the vault system is so powerful
[3:49:58] NitroGW2: holy shit anet has came out swinging with the latest blog post Pog
[3:49:58] Angeels: being delulu is not the solulu
[3:50:01] Saragoober: @mobalord do you think you just automatically get loot from raids
[3:50:13] Saragoober: like you're in a group with 20 people or more depending on difficulty.
[3:50:35] Edeslash: @mobalord Have you noticed how absolutely everything you say is clueless and wrong so maybe your crusade here isnt working
[3:50:39] mobalord: how many people have mythic+ top title and dont raid?
[3:50:40] Bennybaver: why dont I get 486 Ilvl from my +10 vaults :c
[3:50:52] niko_is_bad: Many
[3:51:11] niko_is_bad: There are front page top 20 players who don't raid
[3:51:17] Edeslash: The raid advantage is unique trinkets or cantrip effects on weapons. And that advantage is justified, becaude raiding has to be rewarding, just like m+ has to be rewarding
[3:51:23] Saragoober: KEKW
[3:51:26] itsky_syrup: D:
[3:51:27] dranet11: wow LITERALLY fucked my dog

[3:53:23] Bennybaver: same xd
[3:53:41] mobalord: btw bringing back titanforge wouldn't be the only option, splitting m+ and raid gear (like pvp) would also work
[3:54:12] Edeslash: @mobalord That would actively make the game so much worse for almost everyone
[3:54:24] spruudel: monkaX PianoTime

[4:01:54] SomeGuyNamed: strikes emecci
[4:02:00] Edeslash: @mobalord overall the thing you need to realize that currently raid players are heavily rewarded for running m+ and m+ players are heavily rewarded for raiding and this is how it should be
[4:02:10] Edeslash: if you raid and you don't run m+, you are actively griefing
[4:02:47] Edeslash: People need incentives to try out different types of content
[4:03:24] Edeslash: And if you are only interested in m+, raiding hc is absolutely enough, you dont really need mythic
[4:03:50] MightyTeaBot: doot doot

[4:04:22] mobalord: so you raid all week and then do as much m+ as you need for valor
[4:05:20] Edeslash: Valor isnt really the reason, its a small part of it
[4:05:48] emecci: hes about to swede

[4:16:42] sbiez: is it still relevant? :O
[4:16:59] mobalord: @sbiez they started recycling dungeons some time ago
[4:17:41] sbiez: oh, how?
[4:18:38] mobalord: they don't release 8 dungeons in the first season anymore, they dripfeed them over multiple seasons and fill the gaps with old dungeons, there also aren't more than 8 dungeons per season anymore
[4:19:00] sbiez: sound sloppy somehow :O
[4:19:32] Bagnasty: luckily if you havent played in wotlk they are all new haha
[4:19:54] sbiez: I mean, somehow it's nice they try to make old content relevant
[4:20:56] Bagnasty: i love it since i missed years of expacs
[4:21:03] Saragoober: @sbiez It's fun imo! Changes things up every season
[4:21:09] wulfgang71: do you prefer keys or mythic raiding?
[4:21:13] mobalord: i would like it if every season had 6 completely new dungeons and then 2 recycled
[4:21:18] mobalord: but thats too much work i guess
