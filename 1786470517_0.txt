[1:31:56] Pvmonster: @Basedd_god Yes as I said it was a mobile game destined to the asian market so of course it was pay to win, I have to agree it was a bit aggressive on the pay to win but still do not compare D4 to Immortal its 2 different entity
[1:32:05] DovahChicken: @Basedd_god   It has Nothing with D4 to do     go read the blue posts mate
