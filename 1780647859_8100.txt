[5:01:16] rLeo2: It doesnt make any sense, its like they dont play the game
[5:01:17] j_bar111: I think they were trying to make NOT a healer affix
[5:01:23] sheepheckers: explosives still a thing in the next season?
[5:01:24] EthicalHermit: the multi-spawning is probably so they can get more data on it
[5:01:28] JarynRygrim: JarynRygrim subscribed with Prime. 
[5:01:29] Gezber: blobDance
[5:01:30] Siddydiddydo: someone important at blzizard thought up explosive, and they wont tekll them it sucks
[5:01:34] angahax: They should just make it cleavable
[5:01:39] WhoCaresBears: I thought it spawned less often in next season
[5:01:48] acogz_: explosive isnt a healer affix. they have 1hp. so easy to kill
[5:01:55] Mister_Ript: I mean, mages can remove curse, paladins can remove poisons, priests can remove disease.  Doesn't *have* to be the healer.
[5:01:58] smashwow: they missed comprehension day Kappa
[5:02:06] 91Niki: oof
[5:02:06] EthicalHermit: It should explode for remaining health
[5:02:27] AgentWhiskeyy: yeah but they been buggy about alot of things
[5:02:30] max3107: @EthicalHermit this
[5:02:43] AgentWhiskeyy: was watching max stream and he went over raid bugs and its laughable how buggy it is
[5:02:49] Mecabeast: I saw a sceeenshot of 689k health with 8s to kill it on twitter yesterday
[5:03:00] limburgse: is there any other prot paladin who has issues with Consecration since rework paladin? mine keeps saying that mobs are immune for something since rework :(
[5:03:15] smashwow: iirc explosive did that in legion
[5:03:17] strike879: couldve made the mobs summon explosive with a cast so you could cc for less bombs
[5:03:19] Hizuru1: Tanks and Healers have specific rewards in FFXIV.WoW should copy that
[5:03:30] smashwow: maybe it still is coded that way but with the reduced health we just one shot it
[5:03:36] j_bar111: @limburgse Are they immune to a slow from it or the damage?
[5:03:43] Foretoldlegends: You want to know how Explosive could be easier to deal with? They make the orbs actually take damage to AoE skills and abilities.
[5:04:02] Euny13: I am curious on how hard it would be to give M+ bosses different abilities once you hit a certain threshold of key difficulty

[5:04:55] Siddydiddydo: tanks and healers gear up way faster than other people, their incentive goes away much faster
[5:04:56] limburgse: where they get slowed
[5:05:17] j_bar111: @limburgse idk then just thought maybe that was the reason

[5:07:20] zeiours: I think People need to realise this is m+, it's meant to get harder and harder, not  LFR.
[5:07:33] valianya: I'd like to see them create positive kiss affixes and negative curse affixes that might interact and pair one of each
[5:08:26] George2001k: @towelliee would it be too trivial to just have explosive being affected by AoE?

[5:10:13] Hizuru1: @91Niki Sir so much common sense
[5:10:25] Hizuru1: @Siddydiddydo then dont do it literally most played thing in whole game.
[5:10:33] acogz_: it can be fun and challenging. it doesnt have to be annoyingly hard.

[5:10:58] Siddydiddydo: Specifically related to affixes, the mentality of push weeks vs vault weeks
[5:11:00] tirraldra: i stopped doing M+ because the pugs have just become lazy and awful.. healing this season in the beginning was horrid.
[5:11:09] Hizuru1: People spending more e nergy whining than playing KEKW
[5:11:11] tmiguel27: Nokud Offensive voice line spams LUL
[5:11:19] grabir: how about making the dungeon base damage even more difficult and making affix's buff that you need to interact with in order to be able to complete the dungeon. Play the risk reward card like with thundering for all affixes
[5:11:24] Hizuru1: TRUE
[5:11:25] 91Niki: It's not all fucking unicorns and rainbows
[5:11:28] Hizuru1: PREACH SIR
[5:11:36] Danielnworb: People like it easier
[5:11:39] tirraldra: ngl explosives as a healer gave me purpose.. I loved being top on getting rid of them :)
[5:11:39] Mecabeast: I like affixs that make you change up talents
[5:11:41] notpadfoot: @tirraldra Yo! I'm trying to learn healing. What's easier to get into m+ and fun? Options: MW or Shaman
[5:11:43] sinlesssinner: play heals bro, then you ll change ur opinion @Towelliee
[5:11:49] Hizuru1: Game making you use your brain what a idea
[5:11:51] CeruleanStar: yep it's just more difficult shit thrown at you to make it harder - also more rewarding
[5:11:51] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[5:11:54] acogz_: they shouldnt get rid of affixes. they should just also hasve a rotating group of boons that make positive changes also
[5:11:59] audrock7: Its an affix! They make you actually play!
[5:12:01] flebbooo: I think the new affixes are a great balance of not being overwhelmingly annoying but still challenging enough to keep u aware
[5:12:01] Hizuru1: If you ant heal go be Pepega dps
[5:12:09] vic_ave: then don't heal if you can't  handle healing it
[5:12:12] sinlesssinner: iam with ya
[5:12:18] underground_gamer109: holy pally is they hardest not that mobile of a healer
[5:12:19] grabir: change the  mentality to be that you have to USE the affix to be able to clear the dungeon in time. Not that the affix slows your progress to make it more difficult to complete
[5:12:20] sinlesssinner: its just ppl start asking too much of heals
[5:12:22] theSalute: seems like people are getting lazy when it comes to m+ but m+ is what it is
[5:12:24] underground_gamer109: well without killing urself
[5:12:26] psychopathmario: nerf paladin and buff unholy dk
[5:12:28] rantre208: As a healer, I do not mind the affixes.
[5:12:29] Aendir_irl: Towelliee spitting some facts
[5:12:29] tmiguel27: He wants a free cookie
[5:12:37] tirraldra: @notpadfoot both are fairly good imo - MW and Shaman have big damage output as healers. Personally I like the playstype of MW over Shaman. but thats just personal pref.
[5:12:37] Mister_Ript: I don't find tanking particularly difficult, but I refuse to heal M+ because its so high-stress.  Love raid healing, though.
[5:12:40] sinlesssinner: you gotta dps now, get orbs, do 50k dps, heal ppl that step into shit :'(
[5:12:44] vic_ave: lol healing is too much to ask a healer ? how is that too much
[5:12:44] potnudel: and dps
[5:12:47] Snurretoppen: any1 who can be recrutied=
[5:12:47] Hizuru1: Some of you shouldd play dps KEKW
[5:12:52] Mallaes: Any affixes that makes ppl use their brain is a good thing
[5:12:53] Keglett: healers arent people
[5:12:54] psychopathmario: I just hate how blizzard cannot properly balance paladin its either trash or too op
[5:12:55] flebbooo: true and real :)
[5:13:03] notpadfoot: @tirraldra You think it's harder to get into groups as MW?
[5:13:07] AlphasaurusRexx: @sinlesssinner thats literally not hard at all as a healer
[5:13:10] segarth: killing explosives is not healing...
[5:13:11] tirraldra: give priests a solid interrupt </3
[5:13:15] QuigsTV: Ngl I think most affixes currently are fun. Like sanguine for instance. I have to move and be cognizant of mob hp as a tank. They suck but overcoming them is what makes it fun to me @towelliee
[5:14:24] Hyelander_: Killing explosive = healing. You kill and explosive and you DONT need to heal the damage it wouldve done
[5:14:31] Strange_Inquiries: I don't know how interrupting is not a normal part of peoples gameplay. It just seems like something that makes the game easier.
[5:14:39] NickLeonhearth: In my group we are reasonable ppl, tank dps and healer all kill explosives
[5:15:00] Onearmyof2: yeah issue is people try and to the mdi "meta" thats why heals do all that shit

[5:15:44] psychopathmario: @segarth You forgot  the evoker terrorists that use rescue to clear thundering with melee with 3 seconds remaining after you've CLEARLY moved next to them to clear with, causing a wipe.
[5:16:17] QuigsTV: I think necrotic was worse than grevious. I never had too much of a problem with grevious personally

[5:19:04] Strange_Inquiries: @Shakalakin It's so fucking annoying

[5:19:06] Aendir_irl: They'll write "He was right" on your headstone.
[5:19:17] QuigsTV: @notpadfoot if you really want to be good a tanking, learn all the dungeons well. Know how to set your team for success and even if your dps is bad you’ll still be just fine.
[5:19:21] psychopathmario: @Aendir_irl lmfao
[5:19:21] notpadfoot: @Sollice I've heard tanking is a lot more APM heavy.

[5:20:37] tirraldra: ^

[5:21:08] psychopathmario: Bad tank = key is lost
[5:21:12] tirraldra: bad tank - because a bad healer is bad. a good tank could probably survive with a bad healer.
[5:21:36] Onearmyof2: Ive seen a lot of people running keys 25+ 1 tank 4 dps
[5:21:52] Mister_Ript: no you havent lmao
[5:21:55] Sollice: @tirraldra Thats what I think. Classes have more utility and maybe could last longer with a crap healer. No one can take the place of a tank
[5:22:07] tirraldra: for sure :)
[5:22:17] Trickseynormous: feels like you walked into a sephora
[5:22:24] psychopathmario: @Onearmyof2 yeah  probably protection paladin and 3x retri rofl /jk

[5:22:45] QuigsTV: If you know all the mobs and know the general tank stuff you’ll do fine on any tank but can’t do that shit as well on heals. I’d say as a tank main heals is definitely harder @towelliee
[5:23:08] zodd_amhai: when we getting mega dungeon?
[5:23:09] fewixtwo2: affixes are a lazy way to increase difficulty
[5:23:11] PhoenixAuTv: !drop

[5:23:56] dreamwalker213: @mister_ript Zmok and others are literally streaming no healer keys right now lol
[5:23:59] Onearmyof2: @psychopathmario prot pally, feral druid, ret pally, demo, and shadow.  Psybear has been doing keys 25+ like that
[5:24:05] neveranyluck: lmao
[5:24:07] Sollice: @fewixtwo2 on EXISTING dungeons?
[5:24:12] psychopathmario: Tanking is the hardest role in mythic because your performance matters the most, you need to know routes, you need to tell your team what to do, you need to calculate how many mobs you need to kill etc, as dps and healer you just follow and you listen to tank.
[5:24:17] fewixtwo2: say a remake of the original dungeon
[5:24:19] Vaellder: what if they made a system where as the key level went higher they added certain challenges and effects that could maybe rotate from a pool on a weekly basis
[5:24:25] Sollice: @fewixtwo2 No
[5:24:27] Jardon00: lol that was random, I was the ret pally in that last TW group @Towelliee

[5:25:07] tastytictacs: @psychopathmario I tank very little, and routing isn't very complicated. I find tanking to be the easiest role, personally. Something about being mostly unkillable helps.
[5:25:08] EthicalHermit: Oh the forums would be on wildfire if that happened
[5:25:09] Sollice: I don't want remakes of old things christ that will stop them from making new things

[5:26:02] tastytictacs: @psychopathmario I think being a new player and a tank would be much harder though. If you have any experience in the current dungeon set, it's not too bad.
[5:26:03] Sollice: I am SO opposed to old content, my stance is M+ should only go back two dungeons
[5:26:08] SauceFu: affixes are mechanics
[5:26:11] Sollice: same thing with time walking lol
[5:26:12] PhoenixAuTv: I dunno man, im more concerned with the new 10+ affix hmmm
[5:26:16] Sollice: Sorry 2 expansions not dungeons
[5:26:25] QuigsTV: I don’t think thundering was as bad as prideful
[5:26:36] vic_ave: there is no new 10 plus affix
[5:26:38] Cellazar: Dude! I remember this place! Throwback, glad to see the game still going
[5:26:44] mavericks312: Prideful was so bad

[5:27:03] tirraldra: Loved that one
[5:27:03] Jelanipatron: As a healer I enjoyed Prideful / % based too
[5:27:16] Zolshy89: bc you fuck up the % and the key is GG
[5:27:17] brimtank: you can reach much higher in keys as an undergeared dps rather than an undergeared tank i think
[5:27:23] QuigsTV: My favorite affixes were encrypted in sl and awakened in bfa
[5:27:26] strike879: you didnt need to communicate for those affixes
[5:27:27] Zolshy89: or you wipe on a boss you need prideful for

[5:29:54] brimtank: I try to swap to a different tank every tier if i can
[5:30:01] Jelanipatron: This iteration was better than its first but its still bad
[5:30:03] Sollice: @Snabido Was going to do a healer so would be even quicker
[5:30:11] Sollice: @Towelliee Check Discord when you have a second
[5:30:12] Onearmyof2: bear you have to go out of form to heal though
[5:30:18] jerseyfive: curse and poison remove
[5:30:21] QuigsTV: @towelliee imo seasonal affixes like encrypted or awakened where you decide how weak or powerful you wanna make it is bis. Encrypted for example you can use urh to reset cds faster and the pick up so to skip or move quicker, but you kill the wrong one and it sucks.
[5:30:22] psychopathmario: @psychopathmario my friend was resto druid
[5:30:27] tirraldra: Thundering timed with quaking literally gave me anxiety lol
[5:30:30] tastytictacs: @Brim_BoH love bear, it's so fun... but ya it's pretty bad.. Definitely feels better now than when I got my ass kicked then.
[5:30:31] Mecabeast: So just read you can find cheaper powdered garlic at some stores by checking in the Hispanic foods section instead of the normal spic section.
[5:31:02] Sollice: @Mecabeast That's correct. Was a Florida life hack

[8:04:15] N3llee: not any more
[8:04:21] N3llee: they are not fine

[8:04:26] Panthara: you get -30% when you kill kitava
[8:04:30] Nategamer97: ^
[8:04:34] Clarkerson: It lowers when you kill kitava
[8:04:41] Nategamer97: welcome to the new difficulty
[8:04:45] N3llee: no you take a -30% resist after killing the boss
[8:05:01] N3llee: yep welcome to the new harder mode.
[8:05:05] remedyt: you lose 30% max res for finishing act 5 and act 10

[8:05:33] Nategamer97: its not gonna be good anyways
[8:05:36] Nategamer97: doesnt really matter
[8:05:50] Stunlock: doesn't really matter, crimson has higher chance to roll life
[8:05:54] wellborn: you're corrupted
[8:06:02] N3llee: because thats how it makes the rest of the game harder
[8:06:23] mcexitx: Like Diablo switching difficulties, but they decided to do it mid-game.
[8:06:26] Uhrm: It's a relic from back in the day when PoE had three difficulty levels. It's a way to balance gearing
[8:06:31] Stunlock: Instead of introducing a new difficulty, like torment, you just get -30% res
[8:06:35] cryptotalath: game mechanic...higher resist levels start to show on gear and it increases difficulty
[8:06:39] Nategamer97: this is when you would move on to the cruel or merciless playthroughs in the past.
[8:06:59] FluffehZ: Now is a good time to look for better gear, for more resist and armor
[8:06:59] Nategamer97: you get weaker from leveling in wow? wtf?
[8:07:04] N3llee: When you hit act 10 you will take another -30% hit
[8:07:32] Clarkerson: it's a diff check but you'll prob not notice lol

[8:08:56] FluffehZ: yeah you have a few side quests to do
[8:09:12] ambiotic: No
[8:09:17] ambiotic: You just need to kill kitava
[8:09:21] Stunlock: nope, but some side quests give skill points
[8:09:24] Nategamer97: no, go to the waypoint
[8:09:29] Nategamer97: oh lol
[8:09:37] N3llee: not required but some quests do offer nice rewards including some skill points
[8:09:53] ambiotic: you just gota fix one resistance
