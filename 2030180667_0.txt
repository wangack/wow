[0:23:52] dibiooe: what do you think is bis 2's comp at this point in the game
[0:24:59] notmorbos: i wish i couldve appreciated the "low" warrior damage in prevous seasons
[0:25:01] scopemeup: better than s4 RD?!
[0:25:21] Minpojke: @Bloodx ???
[0:25:40] natedonz33: MINPOJKE
[0:25:53] natedonz33: Let’s get it!
[0:26:06] monbe123: did RD have any counter?
[0:26:15] scopemeup: but at the same time RD has no counters
[0:26:18] monbe123: other than hunter ofc
[0:26:21] scopemeup: if youre somewhat decent ofc
[0:26:21] monbe123: flare
[0:26:24] monbe123: 70s mujsic
[0:26:40] natedonz33: number 60?
[0:27:05] notmorbos: do you think heartbeat makes the game better?
[0:27:06] scopemeup: ye... hunter obv hardcounter to every rogue comp...
[0:27:17] Chrysopoeia: I remember WD could win RD if they werent "that" good
[0:27:21] monbe123: If the hunter listens to specific music also.. its over
[0:27:42] twitchfulgladiator2024: @scopemeup yes nerf traps pls or wait
[0:27:55] scopemeup: tbc w.o rng would just amplify the rogue OPness
[0:27:58] scopemeup: by x10
[0:28:02] notmorbos: well you kinda say you think wrath is too scripted.. how do you remove that without more rng?
[0:28:07] hjathemage: Helloo
[0:28:10] scopemeup: for most comps the only way to win stuff like RM is a stun resist
[0:28:21] natedonz33: be back in a bit
[0:28:48] natedonz33: taking the two youngest to the barber
[0:29:12] scopemeup: I think mana is too much of a none issue in wotlk

[0:30:16] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[0:30:42] scopemeup: when you can force people to drink etc it opens up avenues to gain momentum
[0:30:46] scopemeup: but look at this game now
[0:30:57] scopemeup: both just pve smashing into each other while pala spamms his heals like its a raid boss
[0:31:22] Aspmann: What people don't like about classic is what I enjoy about it. The meta is set, everything is known and there's no "it's gonna get better next patch". Everyone knows what they get into, or should know it
[0:32:41] scopemeup: @RepeatInfinite depends what the meta is ofc, it was somewhat okay-ish in tbc even though rogues were ridicuously op
[0:32:47] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream and the content? Consider supporting by Subscribing or Donating! This is what I do full-time and any amount is greatly appreciated but not expected. Subscribers also don't receive any ads!
[0:32:48] scopemeup: but at least vs most rogue comps you could have fun games
[0:32:51] scopemeup: whereas the wotlk meta
[0:33:00] scopemeup: and especially HPW is such a boring comp to face
[0:33:27] notmorbos: you think so? i always feel like its one of the comps where you do get to play
[0:33:39] notmorbos: but maybe thats because im a feral
[0:33:43] scopemeup: getting to play isnt fun though
[0:33:52] scopemeup: they basically just pve rotate onto each other
[0:33:54] scopemeup: rn
[0:34:03] bicitrici: and yet as it is simple and just pve and spam heal moment you face r1 players you lose in 2m
[0:34:04] Aspmann: Yea this is definitely the worst aspect of it
[0:34:07] bicitrici: Weird dont u think
[0:34:11] Aspmann: And pala being broken in general etc
[0:34:20] scopemeup: ye hpala broken is just bad
[0:34:25] scopemeup: cause the class is generally so uninteresting
[0:34:29] scopemeup: 0 utility and offensive stuff
[0:34:33] scopemeup: just healbot deluxe
[0:34:36] eatmymace: eatmymace watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:34:47] scopemeup: at least tbc rdruid could potentially play super offensive
[0:35:14] dibiooe: idk if my question got missed or if i missed the answer earlier but i asked what min thought was bis comp at this point in the game idk if anyone caught it

[0:35:39] scopemeup: @bicitrici for my untrained eye idnt see any major differences between lets say a glad and a r1 hpw
[0:35:49] scopemeup: obv theres a lot of little things
[0:36:02] scopemeup: but in the grand scheme of things theres not much more than "pump more dmg" you can do

[7:00:56] WinGarbo: Diablo 3 is actually a very good game. The combat gameplay is amazing and it's really fun. The issues is that there is only content for about 1-2 weeks and that's that.
[7:01:06] breakyax: they really capture the atmosphere in those cinematics
[7:01:07] ekunx: you mean 24 hours
