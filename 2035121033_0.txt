[1:36:51] Rebemma: many augs are bad and they die all the time as a healer I have o hard focus on them]
[1:36:53] Cloudthresh: They don't want them? I see so many keys with them still :o it might be cause i am playing aug haha.
[1:36:53] Aegatron: classic here we go agane with the aug discussion
[1:37:00] br0tlord: experienced that they cannot play the aug tha good and the dps lacks
[1:37:29] br0tlord: so its hard to overlap buffs with cds if you are a pug
[1:38:16] AWalnutS: Do you notice the damage amp from aug in keys?
[1:38:16] olihob: The dps in lower keys makes timer difficult
[1:38:33] Rebemma: I did every key on 27 (not rise) but even over 3.5k score they fail a lot
[1:38:41] ignDman: why are you describing my playstyle?
[1:38:47] Jacksprat47: @olihob even with bad dps, outside of something like Rise dps should never really be an issue
[1:38:53] Projectsolo: @Rebemma they are terrible on 25-27 range
[1:38:56] br0tlord: well talking about +25-27, but there are still augs with like 50-60% uptime
[1:39:09] Gnolde: wait...you use rescue for other things than putting people right in front of an abyss? KappaHD
[1:39:29] Projectsolo: If you're an aug doing a 26 and you use renewing blaze and zephyr AFTER damage occur, you shouldnt be there tbh. That guy had 3.3k rio
[1:39:34] caradea_: @br0tlord people need to be fairly stacked, its really bad for them if they're like 60yds apart
[1:39:49] Jacksprat47: @Gnolde yeah putting dps in frontals when they deserve it is also fun
[1:40:07] Aegatron: going to shower and shave brb
[1:40:16] Projectsolo: I've given up expecting augs to use cauterize flame on high keys
[1:40:18] DIXONdB: @Naguura do u think mushrooms this week is the play?
[1:40:26] xQuinton: What is average key level?
[1:40:44] Artresis_: I got yelled at for using zephyr because i disoriented healer thay saved him live KEKW . But aug pugging is a good way to carry keys too ypu idiot proof a lot of things
[1:40:44] StreamElements: Hello Sebleh worryAss
[1:40:51] brugdar_: Are the details plug-ins for predicting Aug damage not reliable?

[1:41:28] Artresis_: @brugdar_ it isnt. It relies on healer/tank dps a lot moee than you think
[1:41:50] br0tlord: so in like +26 tides you really have problems to time with a pug aug as they do less dps, but yeah guess it depends on comp and so on

[1:48:14] y0rge: i do that
[1:48:29] y0rge: i do that mostly on healer
[1:48:36] y0rge: i try dont do that on dps
[1:48:39] tempersmash: how dare u help me
[1:48:40] y0rge: that casat or something
[1:49:04] Goliathse: yeah copium
[1:49:06] Jacksprat47: depends if you're like rescuing an hpal when there's a boomy or hunter there or something
[1:49:09] Daxtez: but evoker only doing 98k overall
[1:49:10] y0rge: premade evoker is not s ame as evoker in pug
[1:49:18] Goliathse: @Daxtez ..
[1:49:22] br0tlord: but they are not pug so the evo can have more dps
[1:49:22] nicoboot: By living them
[1:49:30] TotallyNotRaien: is wow community having some mass amnesia i thought yall went over this already with aug damage
[1:49:32] Kuroz: !trinkets
[1:49:32] StreamElements: Using mirror  and pip.  https://www.dreamgrove.gg/balance/compendium/#trinkets
[1:49:57] Jacksprat47: @TotallyNotRaien some people still don't know pally has brez
[1:50:01] Sangomah: timers (apart from rise) are so lenient its better to err on the side of defensiveness than dmg atm
[1:50:13] Kuroz: oh right...now you have bots blacklisted for the overlay so I need commands to reply on youtube too
[1:50:42] Jacksprat47: if they nerf enemy damage at some point then maaaaybe aug would start being dropped in top keys
[1:50:49] Goliathse: Details are adding a shadowy bar
[1:50:56] Goliathse: on augs

[1:51:03] Feskekongen: are you sure 1 sec is one sec in the m+? mby blizz slowes the time when there is an aug in the groupe :O!
[1:51:09] Shifter2k: @Daxtez You need to look at the buff bar or logs... 98k is just there flat dmg but they will be doing a lot more than that number displays

[1:52:37] UndeaDKilleRcRo: @Naguura any idea how much Haste/Versa/Crit i need for +20's m+ on my resto druid ???
[1:52:44] Shifter2k: If you care about the size of the bar you can go into details > options > combat log > class options - predict augmentation damage (rough)
[1:52:51] tempersmash: ok but if i cant blame evokers i have to take personal responsibility and i cant handle that
[1:52:56] TomaHawK_The_One: aug should be removed from damage tracking so the debate about it will end
[1:53:04] rykhasa: Why do the Evokers get all the apples?
[1:53:06] Drayus_: @tempersmash ^
[1:53:18] Land_ZGZ: too many apples :P
[1:53:25] Feskekongen: you can have my 4 apples, i dont like apples!
[1:53:28] nalight: evokers always gets all the apples :(
[1:53:37] hiamaspen: I think ur overtime ngl
[1:53:38] rykhasa: Are the apples green or red? this is critical
[1:53:46] TotallyNotRaien: remember to switch back your loot spec
[1:53:48] Jacksprat47: what I'm hearing is boomy does the same apples per second as aug
[1:53:54] UndeaDKilleRcRo: @Naguura any idea how much Haste/Versa/Crit i need for +20's m+ on my resto druid ???
[1:54:01] Feskekongen: can i trade the aplles for a banana?
[1:54:04] rykhasa: EZ
[1:54:09] fatliz4rd: Yeaaah, no more low EB farming!
[1:54:15] fatliz4rd: Thanks. Remember to swap your lootspec back
[1:54:21] Sempora: Now to remember to switch your spec back
[1:54:37] tempersmash: too many apples please let me think with my feelings and not logic
[1:54:58] Cutty_xo: yeah but you just look at logs and you can see the difference.
[1:55:01] rykhasa: monkaMath apples
[1:55:13] fumii_tv: i feel like im in 6th grade math
[1:55:23] Land_ZGZ: @fatliz4rd this :)
[1:55:42] Lethepewpew: now take care for your visitor!
[1:55:53] Livexwow: @Naguura i think its very hard for people that barely timed a 20 key in their live to understand how aug evoker works :D
[1:55:55] Shifter2k: Except it does?
[1:55:56] rykhasa: Could someone pose a percentage based math problem to really get the shitshow started? BIGCAT
[1:55:59] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:56:06] OGpersi_: wclogs definitely removes aug damage tho what
[1:56:09] Plebbs: @UndeaDKilleRcRo any ammount is fine for a +20 tbh xD
[1:56:15] VipMalis: warcraft logs removes most of the damage
[1:56:25] tempersmash: NUMBER BIG VS NUMBER SMALL LUL
[1:56:51] Frreppy: Logs does remove aug damage and moves it to aug but not exactly accurate
[1:56:55] lucastbueno: helllo from brazil. nice live !
[1:57:00] br0tlord: sorry for braking this loose but I think its controversial :D
[1:57:20] Jacksprat47: aug is the best audio file format
[1:58:05] fumii_tv: do good augs buff healers in big healing windows?
[1:58:16] fatliz4rd: Yes fumii_tv
[1:58:22] lucastbueno: devastation evoker works ?
[1:58:56] gubiwow: pala -30m dps first boss
[1:59:00] gubiwow: only pad
[1:59:09] tempersmash: dont they give vers too some classes benefit more from it than others no?
[1:59:21] gubiwow: u boss dmg 81m , pala 63m
[1:59:21] OGpersi_: the logs were broken, they would know if it happened now
[1:59:29] Land_ZGZ: Yeah there is an argument for a more tanky comp with more damage output without aug but thats very class specific. Like havoc/rogue/x
[1:59:52] nellfin: locks?
[1:59:59] tempersmash: L O G S
[2:00:10] Jacksprat47: I log it cause I live log raid and forget to turn it off
[2:00:21] Little_Dippin: @Naguura did you swap loot spec back to Boomy after that key?
[2:00:22] lucastbueno: !server

[2:01:39] Kuroz: reminder to open the window since the group will take a while to form anyway hmmMeeting
[2:01:42] Sothis_best_girl: aren't 2 melee kicks enough?
[2:01:54] Jacksprat47: @nerdsht_ then ret is pretty good, dh is really good, play what you like the most :)
[2:02:04] Little_Dippin: So has everything been released now for Dragonflight? Or is there still content before the next xpac?

[2:02:31] nerdsht_: @Jacksprat47 After this long away idk what i like lmao
[2:02:51] Land_ZGZ: we just reached half way mark of season 3 so like 9 more weeks
[2:02:54] Byhythloh: @Little_Dippin Still another season with Fated Raids (All the old raids on rotation each week)
[2:03:08] gamenessi: @nerdsht_ what playstyle do you like?
[2:03:12] Little_Dippin: Will there be any extra dungeons or raids with another season?
[2:03:35] Byhythloh: @Little_Dippin New dungeons, but the last 3 raids on rotation with their gear upped to relevant ilvl
[2:03:43] Jacksprat47: @gamenessi ret is easier and more forgiving but with a lot of utility to use, havoc is now a bit more complex (not much though) and fast
[2:03:59] gamenessi: ret is wicked fun
[2:04:02] nerdsht_: @gamenessi My main was always warlock. But i want to play something new this time around
[2:04:13] Little_Dippin: ok thanks, i might play a bit after my move in a few weeks
[2:04:26] gamenessi: do it... you wont regret it
[2:04:33] Little_Dippin: Havent played since Sanctum came out in Shadowlands\

[2:06:33] gamenessi: don't judge me lol
[2:06:52] nerdsht_: @gamenessi thank for the input.
[2:07:06] Little_Dippin: I think this new talent system will take some getting used to for me
[2:07:22] Little_Dippin: but maybe Warlock or Shaman will be super cool because of it
[2:07:42] gamenessi: both are very fun.
[2:08:17] gamenessi: You can download/import talent trees from wowhead to get started. Or use the Starter talent tree.
[2:08:21] Little_Dippin: Wasnt a big fan of BFA Aff Warlock so as long as it isnt that it should be fun
[2:08:22] gamenessi: everything  is really easy
[2:08:42] gamenessi: Aff is so much better than it was in BFA
