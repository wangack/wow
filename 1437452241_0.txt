[3:37:22] Behemian: @Swifty So in the US you don't have to learn all about the different "wet zones" in a bathroom, to redo it yourself? Because where it's water (taps and drains etc) you have to ground everything properly, or else you'll get electrocuted at some point, trying to turn on the light in the bathroom.
[3:37:26] TheRealDeo_: varies by the job I suppose and area
