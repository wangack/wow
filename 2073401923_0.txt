[0:40:39] moartraps: wouldnt*
[0:40:43] muello: shuffle is great. nobody cares about real 3s
[0:40:55] GRC_chris: the pvp game would be 1000% more awful without shuffle
[0:41:16] bornbetter: @muello @florianich now this is a good take
[0:41:16] Moobot: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFHadK6prEPYQuCmR0tsug
[0:41:53] muello: who enjoys finding mates to que vs the same booster grps on 2k rating like in shadowlands. have to delusional
[0:42:15] sarent02: @muello i agree
[0:42:22] GRC_chris: stuck for 5h in lfg queue simulator on top of that
[0:42:36] GRC_chris: shuffle queues are fast compared to that
[0:43:04] muello: only people that cry about shuffle are the wow pvp elitists.

[0:43:14] venoxsis777: U are the best rogue of the planet 🌍
[0:43:33] bornbetter: the design of shuff isnt great
[0:43:37] Esotraz: TRUE
[0:43:42] bornbetter: and it does split up the other brackets
[0:43:43] GRC_chris: the other brackets were already ruined for everyone except the elitists
[0:43:49] Esotraz: remove 3s and just make 2s the real bracket

[0:43:54] DunacTv: Shuffle is not problem, mmr deflation is
[0:44:01] venoxsis777: U from 🏴?
[0:44:07] mansel_: they need to redesign pvp reward to push people play arenas
[0:44:08] grris: LFG = shuffle
[0:44:08] muello: skirmish is the biggest trash
[0:44:10] grris: KEKW
[0:44:11] bornbetter: the issue with skirms tho is that you dont get conq
[0:45:21] sarent02: actully kinda weird in like LoL everyone qs non rated
[0:45:27] Nezzy243: did u end up getting 2.1 on SP
[0:45:30] AtunconChocolate: @bornbetter  how control that? i mean, wintradings for conq. no is a issue imo
[0:45:36] funkadelikk: now they're adding solo q for rbg
[0:45:39] funkadelikk: one more game mode
[0:45:57] kuringg: the aids part of shuffle is damp and that you have to play with the same idiots for 6 rounds
[0:45:58] muello: also viewers are low for 3s toruneys which shows how little relevant they are. maybe a shuffle tourney would be more engaging for the viewers and would show more skill for adaption in different comps
[0:45:59] Goahti: skirmish win gives 25 conquest:)
[0:46:17] muello: instead of the same teams queing sicne 10+years
[0:46:53] hooqs: @muello lol
[0:47:02] EstexX28: @Whaazz your entire team is streaming besides chan where is the alt 3sss
[0:47:31] SaltyBites: @muello this is your brain on soloshuffle
[0:47:58] sarent02: HAHA
[0:48:00] moartraps: AWC had massive viewers!??!?!
[0:48:00] sarent02: wrong

[0:48:23] sheepbiter: lmao
[0:48:24] sheepbiter: rip ww
[0:48:26] sirius_sx: Lol
[0:48:28] sarent02: they peaked at 23k and the mdi had 32k and wow is a pve game
[0:48:39] grris: do u only hate shuffle cause u are 1.2k as ret?
[0:48:39] dooshken: can tell shuffle supporter cause apparent lack of brain power
[0:48:52] sheepbiter: max kinda steals alot of mdi viewers i think
[0:48:55] sheepbiter: with the costream
[0:49:08] Pepzsi: +1
[0:49:13] sarent02: @sheepbiter he did the same for pvp he had like 4-6k viwers
[0:49:28] SaltyBites: that would be cool if they did a little announcment ingame
[0:49:49] grris: with co streams MDI has like 5x more viewers than AWC tho
[0:49:54] bornbetter: disarm on healer is bis
[0:49:55] bartek8003: although I only play shuffle for past year, I always valued rated 3s more than shuffle. I just play it because my friends left the game and sitting lfg entire day to get 2-5 games is a no no therefore shuffle the only way to play the game for me
[0:50:02] bornbetter: especially rdru

[0:51:41] cauthonx: This is what being Australian feels like LUL
[0:51:45] bartek8003: yeah no cap disarming caster should make them drop in dmg/healing significantly
[0:51:47] aqkernow: 😂😂 when are you doing an NA tournament? I’m going to tune in😂
[0:51:49] Explicitiz: isnt that how the na people play always with this ping?
[0:51:54] susseinvater: when is that tourny?
[0:51:59] Esotraz: been a few year since that was a thing @bartek8003
[0:52:04] grris: are you gonna play ret in AWC?
[0:52:13] grris: I heard you made a ret on TR
[0:52:24] Esotraz: i mean ret is a 30 yard class so prob kinda good for 200 ms
[0:52:45] Ephesiah: Is the cross regional tourney only on NA servers?
[0:52:45] grris: @Esotraz but ret has more range than whazz has shuffle wins on it
[0:52:53] Esotraz: OMEGALUL

[0:53:34] bartek8003: @esotraz I know I know, but still I feel like if disarm is meant to take enemy weapon from them, it should do something against casters. not making them not doing dmg since they can cast without weapon, but they should drop in dmg since their intellect drops without weapon
[0:53:37] Esotraz: Its gonna be nice to see pikaboo vs  whaaz in the first matchup so we can finally see who is teh superior player
[0:53:56] dooshken: gachiGASM

[2:14:40] Dreamscytherqt: The fact that people don't understand it after having it explained 5 times, kind of explains why people don't see any issue in this and it just is what it is LUL
[2:14:51] SaltyBites: wait, how will it work?
[2:15:09] iamreallyafan: should do 4 games and if its 2-2 its untill the enemy team can win on the "other region"
[2:15:23] dooshken: @SaltyBites bro open your ears
[2:15:41] xcires: @Whaazz But you smashed Kawahi and you guys played almost every game on NA!
[2:15:41] honeyloop: lower seed = huge underdog
[2:15:43] zini7: do you think giving 2 points for wining game away would be good idea?

[2:16:21] divinelightz: they do this in soccer right ?
[2:16:22] el_beko90: is there a reason why you have additional arena/group frames behind your camera? saw this by watching offline stream

[2:16:45] SaltyBites: @dooshken ty
[2:16:46] alegpetrovich: insane idea actually
[2:16:52] alegpetrovich: need to do maths if it would work
[2:17:29] antoxdd: @Whaazz is there gonna be an other awc tournament in 2024?
[2:17:40] honeyloop: is prizepool not worth to just fly to a office or somewhere in USA?
[2:17:45] unluckythen: @antoxdd ofc
[2:17:49] dooshken: is cross region always troll?

[2:18:30] SoulLessDestroy: Big surprise if you win awc @whaazz
[2:19:21] threesixnineee: but the lan itself costs more then the prizepool
[2:19:21] Melvred: Exactly, that is what I thought
[2:19:28] sarent02: or make it somewhere in africa so its cheap for them also
[2:19:31] realdreadx: why dont they do community funded anymore? is it because they kept the money last time
[2:19:40] Pidgeylol: bring back LANs!
[2:19:51] dooshken: @sarent02 that would prolly end up being more expensive
[2:19:52] Melvred: That would be best , yes
[2:19:58] unluckythen: blizzard doesnt give a fuck about making the game fair or make sense
