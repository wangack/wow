[42:20:59] Sennica95: Thank you for your service to all the veterans!
[42:21:19] Ascendor81: Probably something generic that people will search like,   MotherFlowering Arcade Classics!
[42:22:24] demonfoxxx: gotcha
[42:22:54] nixybot: BegWan
[42:24:20] turteldu: L-bracket on the top mount it to the horisontal stud, and then screw it to the vertical one
[42:24:34] neftario105: use hammer
[42:24:35] JockoBro: screw
[42:25:07] I_TARKEL_I: flip the whole thing over and use a screw
[42:25:12] sewer_creature: go again
[42:25:24] turteldu: or just a screw trough the studs
[42:25:25] goombasuar: use a screw in top left and bootm right to pull it together
[42:25:31] neftario105: u need a carpenter
[42:25:39] JockoBro: u need a nail and a hammer
[42:25:39] Gizimoo86: use strap and pull it together then screw it
[42:25:52] JockoBro: depends on how thick the iron is
[42:26:01] sarcanthanos: Ratchet strap
[42:26:10] Gizimoo86: yea ratchet strapå
[42:26:11] layzor_tv: you need screws not nails
[42:26:15] intelwithinpodcast: (2) screws - (1) on the left side and (1) on the right side - Screw in at an angle and it will will pull it into the next one.
[42:26:19] Paul__B_: It would be better to use L brackets instead of the C shaped bracket.
[42:26:27] turteldu: can try and just screw trough the 2 studs
[42:26:55] JockoBro: there is a potential the screws head will just go into the wood if u screw it
[42:27:05] abe9090: swifty can you say where the arcade will be. Im local , live in seminole county
[42:27:19] WowHobbs: Gratz on the arcade @swifty
[42:27:34] turteldu: true but as i said can use an L-bracket on the horisontal one and then use it on the vertical one will push it together if the screw doesnt losen up
[42:27:42] Galdrena: he's not annoucing what city it's in just yet but it will be around the Orland o area @abe9090
[42:27:48] Spart4nm4n: @abe9090 gonna be in Orlando area probably near Oviedo
[42:27:53] turteldu: or just ratchet strap between the 2 vertical ones and screw when its closer
[42:28:30] Spart4nm4n: hi @wowhobbs , still playing hearthstone or been playing other games?
[42:28:44] JockoBro: if i were u, i would take the pole apart from eachother and hit the iron until its flat
[42:28:54] JockoBro: and then put it back together
[42:29:00] JockoBro: ur not gonna have enough force otherwise
[42:29:01] intelwithinpodcast: (2) screws - (1) on the left side and (1) on the right side - Screw in at an angle and it will will pull it into the next one.
[42:29:04] abe9090: @Spart4nm4n ok ty. thats very close to me.
[42:29:06] WowHobbs: @spart4nm4n some wow lately
[42:29:30] JockoBro: i dont think the iron is gonna bend because of screw force
[42:29:34] JockoBro: u need hammerforce
[42:29:42] viirracocha: at least now it seems 80% more stable than b4
[42:30:18] Spart4nm4n: nice. I quit wow back in legion but idk if I wanna come back for cata classic since I raided heavily in it but with wow time being expensive I probably won't. I mainly play old school RuneScape now and some other single player games.
[42:30:48] WowHobbs: Nice
[42:30:51] Spart4nm4n: I need to upgrade my PC eventually but car payments are still first for like another 2m5 yrs.
[42:31:31] JockoBro: 9cm wood screw
[42:31:38] JockoBro: 12cm
[42:31:58] demonfoxxx: Duck tape :)
[42:32:05] JockoBro: but im pretty sure the head will just go into the wood
[42:32:06] demonfoxxx: fixes everything
[42:32:19] WowHobbs: @spart4nm4n I have about the same time left with my Jeep
[42:32:28] JockoBro: depends how dense the wood is :P
[42:32:37] Spart4nm4n: @demonfoxxx made with real Ducks?
[42:33:33] Spart4nm4n: @wowhobbs I got a 2019 Ford Eco sport. but been paying about $330.75 a month USD. you are still in Canada right? what part?
[42:33:51] turteldu: @JockoBro ye what i think is going to happen.. unless theres less resistance. But thats why i suggested the L-Bracket on the horisontal stud and screw it into the vertical one.. as the screw will hit the metal and push it in
[42:33:51] demonfoxxx: For the tougher jobs, yes! real ducks!
[42:34:23] layzor_tv: make sure to use wood screws
[42:34:58] layzor_tv: @turteldu youre not wrong
[42:35:09] intelwithinpodcast: (2) screws - (1) on the left side and (1) on the right side - Screw in at an angle and it will will pull it into the next one.
[42:35:14] intelwithinpodcast: you did the screws all wrong bro
[42:35:52] restokin: yeah, 2 45 degree ones
[42:36:08] intelwithinpodcast: screw in the wood like a V
[42:36:33] Gizimoo86: screw in angle so it pulls together
[42:36:37] intelwithinpodcast: Screw in like a V - 45 degree angle
[42:36:41] avenomxx: go on a ladder, hold the wood and screw it in.
[42:37:01] turteldu: just use one of ur L-brackets @Swifty  mount it either to the top or the bottom on the horisontal stud and use the lower hole on the L shape and screw it into the vertical.
[42:37:07] demonfoxxx: I came in late what exactly are they building this for?
[42:37:14] I_TARKEL_I: take that board out and fix it
[42:37:18] intelwithinpodcast: Screw in like a V - 45 degree angle
[42:37:44] Gizimoo86: @demonfoxxx wow classic+ dungeon
[42:38:02] Spart4nm4n: @demonfoxxx some Halloween mausoleum thingy for the arcade.
[42:38:32] demonfoxxx: Nice
[42:38:41] avenomxx: its the new wow dungeon prototype
[42:38:56] Spart4nm4n: yes wow in VR.
[42:39:03] Spart4nm4n: or AR.
[42:39:30] demonfoxxx: I think someone suggested laying it down earlier :)
[42:40:34] demonfoxxx: its ok you can say hey Demon you were right :)
[42:40:43] I_TARKEL_I: pull the side screws out and re seat the bracket
[42:40:51] layzor_tv: thats not going to work
[42:41:13] Gizimoo86: put other wood top so you dont get dents
[42:41:13] Galdrena: 😳
[42:41:14] Sasorinor: you'll destroy the wood, put a little wooden piece where you hammer
[42:41:20] demonfoxxx: I was trying to save their arms lol
[42:41:59] JockoBro: if u remove the wood, and just hit the iron its gonna work
[42:42:09] Sdeleon159: OWLhammerdown
[42:42:11] demonfoxxx: yea
[42:42:22] demonfoxxx: have to go back to move forward
[42:42:44] I_TARKEL_I: yeah remove the 3 screws on the side
[42:42:52] JockoBro: just loose the pole and hit the iron
[42:42:53] Gizimoo86: haha
[42:42:55] avenomxx: orc peon woodwork right here

[42:43:18] JockoBro: ur saving time
[42:43:24] Paul__B_: You need a different bracket
[42:43:24] JockoBro: if u just take it apart
[42:43:31] JockoBro: and hit the iron not the wood
