[0:47:57] WatermelonRaj: @Visija78 GMT-8
[0:47:57] just_morby: i love that enemies in recon don't glow so obviously. a bit harder to see the targets, makes it a bit more balance imo

[0:48:01] maxmax1362: GAMERS JUST PLAY THE GAME STOP SAYIN WE SHOULD NERF THAT AND BUFF THAT JUST FKIN PLAY AND HAVE FUN
[0:48:04] wtfrockzorr: Recon was barely buffed haha. It's good when it's a hard choice to choose between the 3. If anything turret is the weakest right now
