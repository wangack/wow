[4:28:14] Gordon__brown: @JaykobJJ how many viewers do you think low tier tv channels have? probably average of less then 20k... the amount from advertising only depends on how accurately you can predict what ads to actually sell, so in this case, gaming stuff- can probably get good reach / click through rate with esports channels, but yes 20k is small for the big dogs
