[2:10:27] Zaiyge: i dont mind the meta right now good for arcane right
[2:10:27] maybethistimepls: bro boomy sub is most disgust comp in game
[2:10:29] belvedee: Dev damage seems a little high to me
[2:10:41] Deathmarkedx: destro's best comp aint good rn because SP is trash sadly
[2:10:43] rekt1370: outlaw arcane or sub boomy gross
[2:11:07] buffmagespls: dragon good caster
[2:11:13] windfurybot: turbo Kappa ?

[2:11:56] Icetomeetyu: How is a augementation rank 3 in soloshuffle
[2:12:00] MartyrTV1: i just hope they dont buff feral cuz of SL ferals who are too used to surviving every offensive cd thrown at them by using bearform+barkskin crying atm
[2:12:08] threesixnineee: boomy sub is so good in NA cuz they dont have good ele‘s or? @raikubest
[2:12:10] Madjeckyl: Dragon's issue imo is purely just defensively.
[2:12:16] rekt1370: what is the best dev comp is it still frost dk
[2:12:31] betterbeup: @wallstreet12345 Mage is the hardest class to play out of any of them, dh is one of the easiest
[2:12:33] bobthegoblin_: @MartyrTV1 feral and rogue players insta cry and reroll if they dont win the game before it starts
[2:12:38] valky91: what stat prio is fire mage now

[2:14:14] shredder1111: what do u think of frost/demo/hpala? saw kalvish play vs that as rogue/boom/priest and it looked impossible for them
[2:14:16] Deathmarkedx: SP underperforms in every bracket possible in the game
[2:14:17] belvedee: sp does fine sub, but that says more about sub than sp
[2:14:31] rekt1370: a mm hunter thats rare
[2:14:33] Castorcato: glass cannon this shit LUL

[3:07:05] iwantmoremoney3: Raiku I’ve been watching you for a long time and I’ve never seen anyone play wow so perfectly, it’s all very suspicious. Who assures us that you are not an artificial intelligence? We’ve actually never seen you physically play wow but we just hear you talk. What if someone else was playing in your place? How can you prove it?
[3:07:56] JOAXDA: we only THINK we have
[3:08:03] bignoooodle: ^^????
[3:08:08] blueberrypieface: we have not seen an x-ray of you so how do we know you're not a robot
