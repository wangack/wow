[0:12:33] nuclearphosphate: thanks for the reply in discord man, hopefully get to the bottom of that rando ass behaviour warning for chat which i havent even done

[0:14:37] MachoCham: BUT there is captain crackers :pirate:
[0:14:50] nuclearphosphate: huh... "dragonflight raids revisited" wonder what that is
[0:14:51] CloudyHS: am i a bad person for being disappointed in no 10.2.6? i understand its prob low morale over there but man ive been looking forward to the news Sadge
[0:14:51] Neostigma: Did you see the instructions for redeeming captain crackers ?  Its for hunters XD
[0:15:03] NeeK_23: did you see the Crackers post?
[0:15:26] Demeternoth: OH @MachoCham @NeeK_23 HI
[0:15:27] Vedney: Mini-dan looks bigger
[0:15:37] MachoCham: Hi Demeternob <3
[0:15:39] IAmScarlett__: do we know about 10.2.6,,,
[0:15:47] Elrathir: aaany trading post news?
[0:15:52] MarcosTN: Hello there
[0:15:55] NeeK_23: so AI or human error?
[0:16:06] Neostigma: Think they aren't delaying while they are potentialy restructuring ?
[0:16:09] MarcosTN: All right
[0:16:30] nuclearphosphate: any potential mounts u can get from cata timewalking?
[0:16:30] JakeSezz: I was chatting with Thunduz last night night and is it possible with the BNet store drop that the Pirate Flag may be tied to the old games?
[0:16:32] Vedney: Molten Front stuff?
[0:16:39] CloudyHS: check orlandos latest tweets lol, he and holly said their latest playtest can be described as a "bungle" monkaHmm
[0:16:51] Suze_o_0: gooood morning community!
[0:16:51] Vedney: We lost 3 lore historians though
[0:16:56] MachoCham: I tried to get information about Bungle
[0:16:58] MachoCham: I got got
[0:17:04] nuclearphosphate: @CloudyHS i read that as bungie LOL
[0:17:08] Neostigma: The layoffs aren't over though :( Yesterday bunch of Overwatch members got told they were done.  I think all week its moving on maybe ?
[0:17:09] magemaster225: bun-gle
[0:17:11] Vedney: bungle
[0:17:11] Suze_o_0: b u n g l e
[0:17:14] CloudyHS: bungle it means like, a mistake
[0:17:15] Vedney: it means fuckup
[0:17:21] Engram08: clumsy
[0:17:24] GatoVerdeHS: bungle up
[0:17:30] SlithTheSivak: dropped the ball
[0:17:32] MarcosTN: me too, read as Bungie lol
[0:17:45] nuclearphosphate: so.... in otherwords a flustercluck?
[0:17:45] CloudyHS: idk if thats about 10.2.6 or 11.0 tho
[0:17:47] CloudyHS: so who knows
[0:17:47] MarcosTN: oh, it's bungLe?
[0:17:49] HighLordRedhood: The word for the day lol
[0:17:56] MachoCham: In a sentence: They bungled the layoff announcements at Microsoft
[0:18:11] SlithTheSivak: the historians
[0:18:15] CloudyHS: yea
[0:18:18] magemaster225: 60 out of 72 people
[0:18:18] nuclearphosphate: AWC?
[0:18:23] CloudyHS: went from 90-something to 12
[0:18:28] Engram08: Arena world championship
[0:18:31] SlithTheSivak: esports is dead
[0:18:33] Neostigma: The amount of layoffs going on around is insane this month...
[0:18:34] capncolbeer: OW2, PVE staff cut
[0:18:39] Neostigma: Even Eidos montreal
[0:18:56] MarcosTN: but i remember reading somewhere that OW LEague would be getting down, so could be that part also :(
[0:18:56] nuclearphosphate: well diablo 4 is not good so that was to be expected
[0:18:58] MachoCham: I mean the OW2 PVE cuts were to be expected as they gutted the mode
[0:18:58] Demeternoth: Sega just announced 10% layoff too
[0:19:04] lyreilla: Hiiii peeps :)
[0:19:09] NeeK_23: They didnt tell the CoD esports team until yesterday because there was an event this weekend and asked the team to come in on their day off to be laid off
[0:19:14] CloudyHS: i feel bad about being disappointed in no 10.2.6 because of the layoffs but, i cant help but be disappointed
[0:19:20] nevillethewizard: blizzard CS? there goes my ticket lol
[0:19:24] MachoCham: I'm surprised that OW2 is still supported at this point and not just put on maintenance
[0:19:34] nuclearphosphate: waiot what was that about blizz CS?
[0:19:36] laxzzd: No news of hero talents for a month. Did blizzard say release them before alpha?
[0:19:37] alextheblight: literalloy evil
[0:19:40] databob1: @mrgm do you know anything about the new leader?
[0:19:40] alextheblight: literally, even
[0:19:44] IAmScarlett__: i really hope ow2 goes into mantenance
[0:19:50] sibimi: OW2 is doing great as far as I'm aware
[0:19:55] Vedney: Is OW cosmetic collection good yet?
[0:19:56] nuclearphosphate: .... there goes my ticket about htat friggin rando behaviour warning for nothing ive done
[0:19:57] CloudyHS: OW2 is essentially BEING put on maintenance, theyre scrapping every last bit of the PVE and just focusing on the seasonal skin vomit model
[0:19:58] CloudyHS: kinda sad
[0:20:02] MarcosTN: That's why i miss more people like Iwata, when WiiU was getting bashed he dropped his sallary instead of cutting workers
[0:20:03] Vedney: or is it still paying for everything
[0:20:13] capncolbeer: CS to be replaced with Microsoft-AI bots
[0:20:19] NeeK_23: feels like PR team passed her a list to follow, or even just control the twitter account
[0:20:25] Neostigma: even twitch and discord are getting layoffs, it's everywhere, half my team in september got sacked, we fear more is coming
[0:20:32] nuclearphosphate: thatd be good if it was law worldwide
[0:20:37] MachoCham: Twas Neek <3
[0:20:43] databob1: Didn't know if she had a public history or something
[0:20:53] SlithTheSivak: dracJAM
[0:20:53] CloudyHS: me :)
[0:20:54] ImperfectDark: o/
[0:20:54] Demeternoth: oh hai
[0:20:54] nevillethewizard: YO YO YO
[0:20:54] grimblade81: Hey dan
[0:20:56] nuclearphosphate: lets face it, the CEO's etc get FAR FAR too much money in the first place
[0:20:58] DevoidX: hey
[0:20:58] MachoCham: Manny put a good tweet out about her past
[0:20:59] dgriesemer: Hello
[0:21:00] BBMezzy: mrgmLunaPog
[0:21:03] alextheblight: hii
[0:21:04] Neostigma: at least by being " self employed" as you are, you have more control :)
[0:21:05] amricatt: Howdy
[0:21:05] NeeK_23: yeah Japan cant allow layoffs without the CEOs taking paycuts first. Layoffs only allowed if bankruptcy is likely
[0:21:15] HighLordRedhood: yo
[0:21:16] Elrathir: mrgmHehe
[0:21:18] databob1: Mabye no news is good news
[0:21:19] HighLordRedhood: lol
[0:21:23] lyreilla: We sure is!
[0:21:28] Neostigma: Your campfire is back :)
[0:21:44] Vedney: Dont farm until Warband >:(
[0:21:51] CloudyHS: DF has conditioned me into expecting weekly news so its a bit jarring having nothing for a couple weeks
[0:22:20] MachoCham: Manny put a good tweet out about her past employment https://twitter.com/TruVillainManny/status/1752149540436685304
[0:22:40] CloudyHS: quick and dirty run for transmog
[0:22:42] MarcosTN: i'm so sad that i tottaly forgot about it lol
[0:22:46] CloudyHS: always good to have a stock of mog to sell
[0:22:48] laxzzd: Any news of 10.2.6?
[0:22:56] nuclearphosphate: LUL my ticket has now changed to 12 days 20 hours O.o
[0:23:07] CloudyHS: definitely trading post preview atleast
[0:23:25] CloudyHS: time to dust off the ol level 50 alts
[0:23:38] amricatt: Ugh about time to throw all the alts at it.
[0:23:48] CloudyHS: dude honestly shame on wowhead for once again whipping up a shitstorm over incomplete info from datamining
[0:23:49] CloudyHS: they do this so often
[0:23:55] alextheblight: not even mythic; just ahead of the curve
[0:24:00] nuclearphosphate: i just want the spectral tiger etc to be added eventually
[0:24:01] alextheblight: which was also normal back when
[0:24:08] Vedney: Since Blizzard just gave everyone Champion of the Dragonflights, do you think we'll still get a Veilstrider acheive?
[0:24:09] MediumRareOG: so it'll be a recolor of those mounts
[0:24:33] alextheblight: if it's available through MoP timewalking I'd he happy
[0:24:36] MachoCham: I agree with Glad, AOTC not so much
[0:24:40] alextheblight: be*
[0:24:46] SlithTheSivak: kill the past! ~Kylo Ren
[0:24:46] HighLordRedhood: no your totally right
[0:24:49] alextheblight: raiding, that is
[0:24:55] bobbybigbuxx: who cares only try hards
[0:24:55] Engram08: the game is saturated with mounts as is, I wouldn't mind it being available again
[0:24:58] bobbybigbuxx: make the game fun again
[0:25:05] MediumRareOG: I'm torn on this. i don't really like too much FOMO cosmetics
[0:25:12] MachoCham: The achievement should be the FOMO thing, not the mount
[0:25:28] IAmScarlett__: buying aotc doesnt mean you're good though
[0:25:33] Vedney: Shouldnt Mythic mounts be on the same paradigm?
[0:25:34] CloudyHS: i hate the argument that anything time limited is FOMO, how do u have anything special if its available all the time
[0:25:34] databob1: Nope fomo sucks
[0:25:43] Demeternoth: I'm really not bothered either way, I like having mounts that are hard to achieve but me getting it at a time doesn't lessen my achievement if someone else can then buy it.
[0:25:44] alextheblight: I think it's cool
[0:25:45] HighLordRedhood: that's true LOL
[0:25:46] MediumRareOG: let's be real. getting AOTC doesn't make you good at the game. 90% of people just buy it
[0:25:46] nuclearphosphate: @IAmScarlett__ ^ this
[0:25:46] MachoCham: Mythic mounts are 1% and can be farmed but AOTC being timelocked is strange
[0:25:56] bobbybigbuxx: more people buy aotc than earn it
[0:26:04] dright424: I think they should add some kind of Glad saddle for the old mounts. So you need to win a decent amount at a high level to get an older one. It might increase participation.
[0:26:04] IAmScarlett__: most people are actively buying aotc
[0:26:07] bobbybigbuxx: yes 100%
[0:26:07] CloudyHS: theres no way thats true
[0:26:08] roshii90: yeah lol
[0:26:13] MachoCham: It's a massive thing, like 100k atm for AOTC
[0:26:14] roshii90: lots of people buy aotc
[0:26:16] CloudyHS: thats just a made up stat lol u have no way of knowing that
[0:26:17] MarcosTN: Mounts that could be bought could be brought back, like the MIghty Brutosaur, but some that are more tied to doing Arenas or AoTC no
[0:26:18] alextheblight: they do lol
[0:26:20] MachoCham: Or you ask Neek to boost you
[0:26:27] bobbybigbuxx: it is hilariously true guys dont kid yourselves
[0:26:28] MediumRareOG: Mythic mounts being 100% when it's current then dropping to 1% is, to me, a good compromise
[0:26:30] Neostigma: how much would and AOTC mount cost nowadays ?
[0:26:36] roshii90: my guild sells aotc every reset
[0:26:40] CloudyHS: aotc is like 200k
[0:26:48] MachoCham: I've seen it advertised for 100k
[0:26:51] MachoCham: Just for the boss kill
[0:26:53] MediumRareOG: Yes, people buy arena carries. Everything is bought
[0:26:55] IAmScarlett__: @Neostigma for fyrakk? like 200k
[0:26:58] nuclearphosphate: @Neostigma on chamber of aspects (the realm im on) it costs 100k
[0:27:01] NeeK_23: I think CE/Glad mounts are fair and shouldnt be on Trading Post, but theyre also can be obtained with 1% drop chances
[0:27:06] nash25pl: end of DF s2  Sarc HC kill was 65k gold LuL
[0:27:10] Neostigma: not crazy i guess.
[0:27:11] Molly336: You can purchase glad mount too

[0:27:17] nevillethewizard: @mrgm Dragonriding feels so good everywhere now. Do you agree?
[0:27:19] Molly336: and the .1% titel
[0:27:21] nuclearphosphate: @MrGM AoTC on my realm only costs 100k gold
[0:27:22] Vedney: I want old mage tower
[0:27:24] Neostigma: And what about the mythic only mouint ?  2 mil XD?
[0:27:25] bobbybigbuxx: gladiator mounts should stay in the past, anything else though doesnt require skill so it should come back
[0:27:25] CloudyHS: @MrGM just give recolors, that way u have the unique color and feat of strength for doing it when current
[0:27:46] CloudyHS: u can buy glad boosts too
[0:27:51] nevillethewizard: mrgm Dragonriding feels so good everywhere now. Do you agree?
[0:28:18] NeeK_23: secret boss might drop an item
[0:28:24] Vedney: You'll need to come back with Warbands.
[0:28:27] Suze_o_0: well lets see what i can't use in my vault today XD
[0:28:27] CloudyHS: u can pull the entire zone into the boss room btw
[0:28:30] CloudyHS: and just aoe it for boes
[0:28:32] breninn3: breninn3 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:28:33] Molly336: I read something that i really agree on - goes something like "Even if they do make it available, ill always have the memory of the achievement"
[0:28:37] Molly336: They wont
[0:29:02] IAmScarlett__: plus the mount looks ass so no ones riding it
[0:29:06] alextheblight: I got the mage tower skins back in Legion. Make them available again; fuck it, who cares
[0:29:07] NeeK_23: @Molly336 i do BibleThump
[0:29:18] MarcosTN: Going away for some time, leaving on Lurk, Good game :D
[0:29:29] nuclearphosphate: ive still got no idea where the mage tower is, nor how to access it
[0:29:36] NeeK_23: Legion Mage Tower could be overgeared though
[0:29:41] IAmScarlett__: @nuclearphosphate the broken shore.
[0:29:48] Xesol: thats kind of my feeling - if its something you can buy in trade chat theres no prestige so why not bring it back
[0:29:59] nuclearphosphate: @IAmScarlett__ huh
[0:30:20] MachoCham: Garrosh Heirlooms shouldn't have been removed. I say that having some of them
[0:30:23] IAmScarlett__: @nuclearphosphate its in the broken shore, just have to do a small quest chain to get there
[0:30:25] HighLordRedhood: The pally Epic mount was a challenge back in vanilla, now all new pally's just learn it automatically. So this is nothing new, tbh
[0:30:27] CloudyHS: it has no prestige if you choose to buy it, u can still get it legit and it will have personal prestige to you
[0:30:40] NeeK_23: I want Prepatch content back like War of Thorns from BFA, its important story content just abandoned
[0:30:42] nuclearphosphate: @IAmScarlett__ need to have a look there, not been to broken shore in AGES
[0:30:45] IAmScarlett__: @MachoCham i wish they came back
[0:31:11] Xesol: you can only get 1 i think
[0:31:24] NeeK_23: about 2k on my server for the key
[0:31:26] alextheblight: to add to that, I completed the epic pally mount quest just before it became learnable through class trainers. Them's the breaks
[0:31:27] Xesol: oh i didnt know it was weekly
[0:31:30] joe_stormz: is it a bad idea to start this game? i never touched the original or expansions.
[0:32:00] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:32:11] nuclearphosphate: @joe_stormz never a bad idea to start the game tbh u can choose what expansions to quest in so give it a bash
[0:32:13] NeeK_23: A Fyrakk kill cost me 80k last week on my undergeared alt
[0:32:26] CloudyHS: but honestly shame on wowhead for again whipping up a shitstorm with incomplete info from datamining, they do this so often its super irresponsible
[0:33:03] RAF_Sean: Good morning VietDan
[0:33:05] JakeSezz: Are you still working on a documentary-style vid or decided to scrap it?
[0:33:13] Haestoh: good afternoon all
[0:33:30] MachoCham: True story, he recorded it on the sofa watching the rumble Kappa
[0:33:31] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:34:19] JakeSezz: Sweet! I’m stoked to see something different from ya like that
[0:34:26] RAF_Sean: Just got off a call with a new therapist. He seems nice
[0:34:26] MediumRareOG: have you maxed all your cata reps?
[0:34:40] CloudyHS: graveyard was the one with whitemane in it, its in the room with the first boss
[0:34:44] CloudyHS: hes in one of the catacombs
[0:35:30] ImmortalRose1: I'll never understand the "people can buy it so it doesn't matter debate" in terms of mounts/achievements. Did you buy it personally or earn something legitimately? If the latter, you earned it. Stop concerning with how others obtained something. It doesnt diminish YOUR achievement. If you place value on things based on how other people play you may just need to change your outlook. Its a game meant to be fun. And if someone wants to buy a mount, let them, who cares.
[0:36:39] NeeK_23: agreed, what mounts others have doesnt affect me. I only care what I have
[0:36:44] MediumRareOG: Just swiping a credit card devalues things because the game is no longer about skill or persistence. It's about how much money you spend
[0:37:13] IAmScarlett__: violet spellwing?
[0:37:15] nuclearphosphate: speaking of argus, how do you get to antorus nowadays?
[0:37:37] MediumRareOG: I wish I had Spellwing
[0:37:38] JakeSezz: I GOT ANOTHA CONFESSION TO MAKE: I totally bought a WoW token to help get me more gold to buy the Lightframe mount from Legion mrgmKEKW
[0:37:40] NeeK_23: @nuclearphosphate Legion Dalaran
[0:38:00] ImmortalRose1: @MediumRareOG thats only if you yourself spend money. if you do something the way its intended you used skill. dont compare your achievement with others. someone buying an aotc mount doesnt diminish me or my gujilds send of achievement for getting it normally. idk why people allow themselves to care about it
[0:38:25] JakeSezz: Yup that one 😂
[0:38:34] NeeK_23: I love that mount, I really wish I'd played back then for it
[0:39:03] RAF_Sean: Does it matter if you 'earned' it or not tho? Ultimately it's just a fun mount for the collection
[0:39:05] Wynem: TW raid been good so far, got 1 mount and a 400k BoE
[0:39:07] MediumRareOG: @ImmortalRose1 the only point in these things is to flex it over others. in classic it was standing in stormwind an dlooking like a badass. that's continued
[0:39:32] Haestoh: Items/Mounts/Achievements being a "status symbol" in WoW is too far gone of an issue to worry about these days.
[0:39:34] Wynem: its already sold
[0:39:39] Wynem: Goblet of Anger
[0:39:52] NeeK_23: did 2 Firelands TW today , got 2 pets KEKW no mounts
[0:40:18] NeeK_23: lots more alts to go though
[0:40:26] nuclearphosphate: @NeeK_23 ive got all the mounts from there :D
[0:40:36] breninn3: Are new trading post rewards out?
[0:40:37] death_cam_: pre cata "removed" patterns
[0:40:37] IAmScarlett__: my 10.2.5 ptr was updating yesterday
[0:40:42] death_cam_: they added them to vendor ages ago
[0:40:43] MediumRareOG: What mounts can you get from Firelandds TW?
[0:40:48] databob1: A big deal os made about mounts and cosmetics not muttering because they are cosmetic but then why restrict them.then if they don't matter it's circular logic
[0:40:57] ImmortalRose1: @MediumRareOG this is entirely anecdotal. if thats why someone plays the game, thats theyre choice and I hope they have fun. I play the game for me. not the validation of strangers online lol.
[0:41:02] NeeK_23: @nuclearphosphate TW Cata can drop Dragonsoul mounts which I need. I have both Firelands ones
[0:41:09] pencilpenguin: What aotc mounts were you guys talking about btw?
[0:41:13] databob1: Wow i can't type
[0:41:32] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 Now I'm going to have to farm it madge
[0:41:38] AlfredK: Yea SoO
[0:41:44] IAmScarlett__: siege of orgrimmar was the first aotc mount
[0:41:52] thunduz: howdy
[0:42:04] nuclearphosphate: @NeeK_23 didnt kno that
[0:42:05] thunduz: how we vibing today?
[0:42:07] NeeK_23: @MachoCham yeah and Rag isnt pug friendly like Yog or Illidan
[0:42:11] nash25pl: I THINK and that a giga brain moment They said it wont be on trading post BUT  They never said anything about filling the log bar reward about it !
[0:42:17] JakeSezz: I spoke @thunduz into stream’s existence saltyb27Cheers
[0:42:38] laxzzd: Hope we get more news of hero talents
[0:42:43] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 I only need the heroic DW mount PepeHands
[0:42:46] Vaephera: There were other things that had random tender costs as well as the mount, like Ai-Li's skymirror and a crafted engy pet from vanilla, it seemed like just bad/test data or something
[0:42:49] NeeK_23: Feels like MoP pandamonium reward/drop
[0:42:54] nash25pl: @MrGM if you think about it  They never said about selling trading post tender but you can get it by buying other items threw their shop
[0:43:05] Elrathir: Did you ever get exalted with the Obsidian Warders?
[0:43:06] Demeternoth: it was just to get us to moan about that rather than the layoffs.
[0:43:27] ratgefingah: werent there some rumors about some new mop stuff too?
[0:43:44] funviking99: when is 2.6 coming?
[0:43:48] Saltycaptcha: I wonder if the layoffs will affect the roadmap
[0:44:02] NeeK_23: how do you even farm it?
[0:44:08] IAmScarlett__: @Saltycaptcha holly already said they wont
[0:44:14] Layliah79: Happy Hump Day!
[0:44:16] BBMezzy: + some specific pet battle WQs in the dragon isles
[0:44:34] breninn3: Ozruk voice line is so sick
[0:44:39] Elrathir: I'm out on the forbidden reach doing any quest I can do searching for Obsidian Warder rep
[0:44:53] Saltycaptcha: wasn't the wow lore team impacted?
[0:44:59] NeeK_23: are rares on FR soloable now? I guess still not.
[0:45:05] BBMezzy: They were yes
[0:45:07] Layliah79: yes
[0:45:12] MediumRareOG: forbidden reach is in my "maybe in 11.0" bucket
[0:45:12] breninn3: WoW Lore historians were affected
[0:45:20] steve_mcyeet: I miss wow so much. Thank you for streaming.
[0:45:24] Elrathir: well, it's also just fun being out in the Forbidden Reach again for me :)
[0:45:38] ahux_: @breninn3 I mean the past few expansions lore sucks so makes sense
[0:45:43] ratgefingah: its a nice enough zone
[0:45:53] ratgefingah: zaralek cavern is what feels weird to me
[0:46:01] NeeK_23: team of 5 dropped to 3 now I think. There was a post from one of them on Reddit explaining what the Lore team does
[0:46:15] BBMezzy: Forbidden reach was great, it was bad that they repeated the same gameplay loop in the immediate next patch too

[0:48:03] magemaster225: ats def a tournament arena for OTKth
[0:48:11] Kubwa7: so basically just another duel arena
[0:48:14] amricatt: I like Forbidden Reach but I wish it was more of a storyline.  I didn't like that key thingie though.
[0:48:49] MachoCham: @MachoCham Yep was phased!
[0:49:52] Airt1: @MrGM hey have you done Firelands yet?

[0:54:33] amricatt: Did you say Love is in the Air starts Monday?
[0:55:01] databob1: I hope they do the trading post preview today
[0:55:07] NeeK_23: another 14 days of disappointment
[0:55:16] Airt1: you need your toons at 60 right?
[0:55:21] Jelky55: X45 Heartbreak pls ! big love rocket is rude
[0:55:21] amricatt: I saw the holiday "doodads" I was wondering which would be the trading post and which would be just decoration.
[0:55:23] AlfredK: Does Lunar Festival and Love is in the air overlap like this?
[0:55:29] AlfredK: always*
[0:55:46] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM

[0:56:55] MediumRareOG: iirc the love rocket daily was too annoying to farm so i only did it twice a day
[0:57:04] databob1: love is in the air stuff for dragon riding mounts awesome then I can show off my love dragon
[0:57:23] alicemch: loserssss
[0:57:24] JakeSezz: Cuz they’re always angry. Happens when one is a sad, lonely, pathetic soul
[0:57:26] Layliah79: what?! lol
[0:57:29] MachoCham: mrgmSell mrgmSell mrgmSell

[0:57:59] thunduz: mrgmSell mrgmSell mrgmSell
[0:58:12] orkatist: It was when you said that the new president of blizzard was following you! It was such an awkward post from the commenter lol
[0:58:14] databob1: being a sellout is kind of your job
[0:58:55] thunduz: Someone queue Reel Big Fish song mrgmSell
[0:58:57] orkatist: lol proper response
[0:59:20] RAF_Sean: Wish I was big enough to sell out lol
[0:59:20] MachoCham: I liked it
[0:59:21] Layliah79: 2 likes def is EVERYONE KEKW
[0:59:24] MachoCham: mrgmSell mrgmSell mrgmSell
[0:59:27] thunduz: I’m gonna go like it mrgmFine
[0:59:31] Shrandamar: MrGM got us all fooled
[0:59:33] Shrandamar: xD
[0:59:39] AlfredK: One of the downsides of the internet is that it is allowing all these weird mentally ill people speak out
[0:59:45] databob1: see everyone is cool that your a sell out
[0:59:56] MachoCham: Yikes
[1:00:05] hobafett: hey bud, haters gona hate, who fucking cares xD love your work!
[1:00:34] AlfredK: If they would behave like this in real life they would get beat up lol
[1:00:37] MachoCham: Lets not use mental illness in that context to justify behaviour please <3
[1:00:39] lyreilla: Yeah!! 💪
[1:00:58] amricatt: @MachoCham <3
[1:01:30] NeeK_23: anonymity
[1:01:31] dastago: it's weird they always think you owe them something. you don't owe them anything as much as the guy who works as sainsburys doesn't - you're just doing a job
[1:02:12] lyreilla: Usually it's because someone else is treating them that way or worse. Not always though. It's still unacceptable behavior though.
[1:02:19] BBMezzy: I've said it before and I'll say it again, people have very much become addicted to hate
[1:02:21] amricatt: Am I a sellout for loving my company where I work?
[1:02:40] lyreilla: @bbmezzy truth
[1:02:53] nuclearphosphate: genuine question, what the heck is the point of that "self found" mode in classic?
[1:02:55] handovdoom666: oh man, what tasty drama did I just walk into? gm mrgm
[1:02:58] Demeternoth: @amricatt that  makes me one too XD
[1:03:11] MachoCham: Lack of social interaction and people being stuck behind screens with no consequences
[1:03:14] UndeadKillerTBC: normies discovered the internet
[1:03:15] Airt1: the pandemic fried a lot of people's brains
[1:03:22] hobafett: i have so much respect for streamers, that have not only made a community but deal with shit like this while doing so.
[1:03:22] handovdoom666: haters gonna hate
[1:03:23] databob1: people also tell others to kill themselves as a casual response. anonymity is a hell of a drug
[1:03:34] RAF_Sean: We platformed people who cater to and thrive off of the worst parts of being a human and it made everyone think it's ok to be a shitheel
[1:03:49] amricatt: @Demeternoth LOL. We're proud mrgmSell mrgmSell mrgmSell
[1:04:11] JakeSezz: @raf_sean FACTS
[1:04:11] Demeternoth: @amricatt I totally am, I'm just back from two days away with my team. It was BRILLIANT
[1:04:16] nuclearphosphate: @MrGM whats the point of that "self found" mode in classic?
[1:04:17] MachoCham: shit heel as in MJF as a shithouse or a shit heel as in Jay White where no-one cared
[1:04:22] dastago: i think a lot of them are probably kids. i hope so at least
[1:04:22] handovdoom666: you need a license to fish or drive a car. what about a license to use social media?
[1:04:42] Scraggersmeh: God, this dungeon is a blast from the past.
[1:04:48] Demeternoth: @nuclearphosphate it's more akin to the original HC add on mode - with no selling/AH involved
[1:04:49] nuclearphosphate: hardcore challenge?
[1:04:58] amricatt: @nuclearphosphate It's a different set of rules for hardcore.
[1:05:08] NeeK_23: the internet is full of cockwombles who think they  need to spread their bad takes to everyone
[1:05:49] amricatt: @Demeternoth I'm jealous.  I work remote and never met my teammates.  hoping for the company to fly me to Las Vegas  where they are located for team building!
[1:06:57] Demeternoth: @amricatt most of us are remote too, that's why the last two days were so good - nice country hotel, good food, silent disco on Monday night and lots of time with the people I adore at work :D

[1:10:02] nuclearphosphate: !fight
[1:12:43] lunamists: joys of her getting bigger :D
[1:12:53] AlfredK: We haven't gotten a preview of the next trading post. Maybe it is because of the lay offs? :/
[1:13:29] nuclearphosphate: @AlfredK im 100% expecting it to be useless stuff like more transmogs tbh LUL
[1:13:34] NeeK_23: didnt someone say they want to post out of respect
[1:13:46] AlfredK: So indirectly?
[1:13:48] lunamists: theres a brand of heinz baby food, different kinds of porridge weve given our little girl but she also has these Ella's kitchen sticks, should try those if you wanted to :D
[1:14:40] MachoCham: It wasn't recommended to us on our first couple
[1:14:43] breninn3: Exposure to allergens is definitely recommended
[1:14:53] MachoCham: It was only started to be introduced by the time we had our last
[1:15:00] Neostigma: My cousin is a doctor, says peanuts is a must... If you look at india, they have almost 0 allergies cause they eat it quite freaquently.
[1:15:15] lunamists: we haven't tried our little ones with it just yet really, Arthur stole a chocolate i got for christmas that had nuts in so now we know hes not allergic to nuts
[1:15:16] MediumRareOG: early exposure to nuts reduces the chances of developing a nut allergy
[1:15:19] MachoCham: I'm not that old ffs
[1:15:23] Neostigma: it really is
[1:15:24] breninn3: Body doesn't go shit wtf is that, let's respond super overkill style
[1:15:31] MachoCham: The introduction to build tolerance
[1:15:41] Neostigma: wheat also ?
[1:15:43] Neostigma: for gluten
[1:15:44] snagprophet: soya's another one isnt it?
[1:16:08] MachoCham: Tho tbh by the time we had our 4th; her first food was vodka jelly
[1:16:17] thunduz: my sister just tried peanut with her son who’s 10 months and he got a rash from it so she started to freak out.
[1:16:41] breninn3: When can kids start eating honey? I know it's not allowed until a certain age but can't remember when
[1:16:41] MachoCham: Dragon Soop jelly?
[1:16:41] lunamists: ive never had vodka jelly LUL
[1:16:45] snagprophet: then there's the general intolerance, like I get weird stomach aches and digestion when I have sourdough pizza for instance
[1:16:50] Neostigma: Usualy first allergies will be rash, that is almost the only and last warning. After that can get worse
[1:16:51] MediumRareOG: some people do have a genetic predisposition to certain allergies. a big part is environmental though
[1:17:51] handovdoom666: avocado toast using sourdough is the best
[1:17:59] breninn3: Afflicted on netfflix is a good watch about allergies
[1:18:08] MachoCham: That's the theory
[1:18:27] Neostigma: I mean, what about bee stings then ?
[1:18:32] MediumRareOG: early exposure reduces the chance of developing allergies
[1:18:37] Neostigma: although that is a toxin i guess
[1:18:37] JakeSezz: @handovdoom666 TRUUUUUUE
[1:18:55] snagprophet: not really, I didnt have peanuts for my entire life until I was in my early 20s and I'm only allergic to specific nuts like pine pesto, pistachios and cashews etc, not almonds though because its in marzipan
[1:19:01] AlfredK: Lol what. Never heard that before
[1:19:07] MachoCham: I have an intolerance to cunts, I don't think being exposed to them at a young age would have helped build resistance to it tho
[1:19:27] Neostigma: could just be that his intestinal flora is completely gone because of all the coke he drank ?
[1:19:29] AlfredK: I have only heard that flat coke is good for your stomach
[1:19:30] breninn3: @MachoCham LUL
[1:19:31] Demeternoth: @MachoCham xd
[1:19:35] SskygamesS: HeyGuys new here finally found another streamer doing ATT stuff PogU can i ask your ATT %  so far :) ?
[1:19:49] Demeternoth: WELCOME @SskygamesS :)
[1:20:07] SskygamesS: Well Done Clap
[1:20:12] snagprophet: there's something in original Coca Cola that makes my spine ache, perhaps its the content of sugar compared to anything else, but i can have Diet, Zero, and all the Pepsis without issue
[1:20:13] MachoCham: I blame the soop
[1:20:14] SskygamesS: Demeternoth thank you thank you :)
[1:20:22] Neostigma: He isn't eating mentos before drinking coke right XD?
[1:20:46] breninn3: I only ever drink coke for the spine ache tbh
[1:21:02] lunamists: not me sat here with a bottle of coke rn LUL
[1:21:05] AlfredK: If it is chocolate then it is probably worth shitting yourself every now and then
[1:21:10] demolz: when i drink coke i dial ria
[1:21:37] Neostigma: used to drink 2-3 liters of coke a day for 10 years... I am completely fine but now drinking pepsi max instead XD
[1:21:42] death_cam_: got some dark berry tango rn :D
[1:21:44] snagprophet: I miss the Katsu McNuggets at McDonalds, absolutely amazing
[1:21:51] SskygamesS: mostly on twitch content is m+ pvp and raids so is not easy to find something inside what i like , means att, not easy is  long journey indeed
[1:22:03] lunamists: i went out with the in laws earlier to get lil mans hair cut and had my first jacket potato since meeting Thor LUL was so good
[1:22:56] krtjan: Heya :D
[1:22:58] breninn3: Literally using you as background noise whilst I work, but stream chat too interesting
[1:23:06] MachoCham: I do think that ATT content has only become "mainstream" since Shadowlands
[1:23:14] MachoCham: @breninn3 That's a mood
[1:23:14] krtjan: wow ppl grinding att :D
[1:23:20] lunamists: i haven't had one since before meeting Thor, which is almost 3 years in april
[1:23:23] krtjan: how high %? :D
[1:23:41] NeeK_23: World of Cozycraft
[1:23:51] SskygamesS: plus ATT on war within will make more sense with all the updates they are doing
[1:23:53] krtjan: zg grind takes quite a while xD
[1:24:06] Vesamora: Yeah I'm in here almost every morning lurking and using the stream as background noise while I work. I catch a lot of news I otherwise missed lurking here.
[1:24:07] lunamists: yeah LUL
[1:24:08] MachoCham: I have an idea
[1:24:15] MachoCham: Hold this space
[1:24:41] lunamists: they were both definitely surprises but happy surprises
[1:24:52] NeeK_23: I doubt anyone has been that excited about Tol Barad in a long time
[1:25:13] Neostigma: this is where alts are good XD
[1:25:21] Layliah79: NA servers back up!
[1:25:23] NeeK_23: lots of dailies for all items
[1:25:25] breninn3: 13 years deep into my relationship, no kids here though. Respect to those who can do it, but I am not the right person to have kids
[1:25:29] AlfredK: Oh no Tol Barad

[1:28:08] krtjan: its so hard to finish thoes items just from that raid, the loot pool per boss is so high xD
[1:28:13] SskygamesS: warbands Kreygasm
[1:28:27] Layliah79: wonder how long it will take them to go backwards into other expansions. think it will be part of the smaller patches over time next expansion?
[1:28:27] Neostigma: depends how much space you get and how items stack
[1:28:28] krtjan: easier to get marks and buy thoes items from pvp shops xD
[1:28:30] jessetenfour: Agreed, I wish they'd go ahead and release the learn any transmog
[1:28:45] steve_mcyeet: They have warbound items now
[1:28:50] AltoBeldin: should have set the raid to 25 man as you get more drops
[1:28:51] steve_mcyeet: which would be like soulbound items in bank
[1:28:55] s7wede: No they specified the bank was for reagents and specficaly account bound gear
[1:28:55] MediumRareOG: account wide could be bad if we lose total storage. i use all the storage on each toon and have personal guild banks
[1:28:57] SskygamesS: i think will be not be call soulbound but warbound
[1:28:58] bershyy: i think all items are gonna be warbound and when they get equipped they are soulbound
[1:29:22] Big_Rum: Hello there!
[1:29:28] AlfredK: Is that how you will be able to get transmog for other classes? Warbound items? Will it not work for old stuff then?
[1:29:32] Layliah79: Save so much $$ not mailing to alts!
[1:29:56] SskygamesS: we going be able to collect from all types even if we cant equip
[1:30:09] s7wede: My big wonder is going to be gold. Is the bank going to be able to hold 1 entire accounts worth of gold (50 million) or will it be more
[1:30:14] MachoCham: Hope they manage to fix the issue with learning on selling gear
[1:30:17] Layliah79: Transmogs tho i thought was for WWI ONLY at first, then over time they would go back and change other expansions?
[1:30:54] str4ysheep: like they do it to greys now
[1:31:05] Lheela: i think they'll just make it so when you pick it up you learn it?
[1:31:06] Artful_Dodger: @s7wede In theory it should now be 60 gold caps.
[1:31:19] Lheela: or we talking boe?
[1:31:20] Neostigma: Watching this brings back memories as a tank XD
[1:31:40] S3N71: Do you really think we could see TWW Alpha in March?
[1:32:16] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS Easier with Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[1:32:21] s7wede: @Artful_Dodger I forgot it got increased by 10, but still, I hope they increase it to something like 100 million
[1:32:43] SskygamesS: i think you will get warning message to learn boe's from gear you cant equip
[1:32:48] Layliah79: must be a reason cause they ALWAYS do the "This Week in Wow"
[1:33:15] Lheela: completed my very last covenant armor set today and got my last cata dungeon drop from end time :) good day
[1:33:27] Layliah79: FeelsStrongMan you didn't know!
[1:33:31] AlfredK: I noticed that the Scarlet set is still mail if you do the old scarlet dungeons. It needs to be plate like they did with all old gear in other dungeons D: warriors cant transmog it now
[1:33:35] S3N71: This month's Prime drop is a pirate parrot I believe?
[1:34:10] Lheela: @AlfredK isnt there a plate set from darkmoon faire?
[1:34:23] BE3njo: y there is darkmoon faire which is plate and mail
[1:34:24] Lheela: pretty sure there is, but its expensive
[1:34:25] laxzzd: Will 11.0 alpha start soon after 10.2.6？
[1:34:30] Lheela: and you need the tabard to buy it
[1:34:36] AlfredK: Yea but the transmogs from those dungeons dont work for the classes that would have used them in classic
[1:35:08] BE3njo: @Lheela yep
[1:35:08] Neostigma: not doing it in mythic /
[1:35:09] Neostigma: >
[1:35:35] Dackor: How did you enjoy the royal rumble?
[1:35:40] krtjan: one timer
[1:35:45] Lheela: nope shared
[1:35:48] krtjan: only Firelands can be done on both dif
[1:35:56] Lheela: ATT tells you what raids you can do on multiple difficulties
[1:36:18] MachoCham: Jazz?
[1:36:19] MachoCham: Oh
[1:36:30] Lheela: when you hover over the raid if it says "shared" you can only do one diff a week, if it's "per difficulty" you can do it multiple times
[1:36:39] Dackor: RTruth with the insane tag
[1:36:56] Lheela: in ATT
[1:37:15] Big_Rum: I completely agree it needed a nostalgia rather than that nonsense with the commentator, who came in, and then just eliminated himself. Anybody could’ve been Cena, the rock, anybody would’ve been cool.
[1:38:10] s7wede: With all the controversy surrounding the WWE atm, they probably reached out to a number of people who probably all declined so it was a last minute hail mary
[1:38:24] NeeK_23: fyi its darkmoon fair this week, for achivist rep, maybe worth not handing in the big dig for extra 10%
[1:38:50] MachoCham: He went over strong tbh, glad for him
[1:38:57] Lheela: cata dungeons are fast farms, classic, tbc and wrath are far worse
[1:39:10] MachoCham: The best thing to have come from this
[1:39:20] MachoCham: Yeah Rick has had a rocky recent past
[1:39:41] MachoCham: Got unbooked from a few events because of it
[1:40:32] s7wede: Check what mutual servers you have with the bot and leave them. It worked for me
[1:40:33] MachoCham: Pre-empt them by asking if THEY need Art
[1:41:20] s7wede: If it's from a reputable server, message the server admin and complain. Those people will quickly lose access.
[1:41:54] NeeK_23: if not bots, then someone selling you AI art as their own
[1:41:55] BBMezzy: I've gotten random friend requests on discord as well, usually from your discord. Never seen their name before, no message or anything
[1:42:09] S3N71: Have you got the 100 Rep achievement yet?  I'm on 92 at the moment
[1:42:16] AlfredK: Yea we need a new secret mount
[1:42:36] NeeK_23: tin foil hat time.....maybe there is but we havent found it yet
[1:42:59] magemaster225: Most of those legion/bfa ones were developed by celestalon, but hes been on hearthstone now
[1:43:03] NeeK_23: there's Owl statues in Legion still not discovered
[1:43:07] s7wede: The big issue with wow and secrets is that the secret finding discord has got so good at completing it, it's very hard for Blizzard to balance that line of doable secrets vs the speed at which secrets are solved
[1:43:22] Lheela: yea that boss is bugged
[1:43:29] Lheela: you can feign death to reset i think

[1:46:23] NeeK_23: I usually only go on beta for mechanical/class/talents changes so rarely see more than the training dummies. The story I want to experience on launch
[1:46:24] S3N71: At the moment, I'm more pumped about SoD P2 and what new runes they add
[1:47:00] NeeK_23: if Im not around as much, thats why, nothing personal

[1:47:21] Ironhide_Gaming: you see they added Warcraft and Diablo to battle.net launcher? The originals.
[1:47:25] MachoCham: It is personal, don't let him fool you
[1:47:32] thunduz: I just dip out and come back later in the
[1:47:38] Ironhide_Gaming: for money

[1:47:52] Ironhide_Gaming: like 5 and 10 US
[1:47:57] MachoCham: £8.99!
[1:48:08] MachoCham: Paid less than that at Game in 2000
[1:48:38] S3N71: I played Warcraft I, was more a Command & Conquer fan back then
[1:48:47] NeeK_23: WC1 & 2 look pretty rough by todays standards both graphically and in playstyle
[1:49:17] s7wede: If you owned the physical editions of those games, they should let you put in the CD-keys and add them to your library!
[1:49:51] handovdoom666: i own nothing with a CD/DVD drive anymore
[1:49:53] AlfredK: You will be exalted long before getting all the tokens from Tol Barad heh
[1:49:57] funviking99: portable cd
[1:50:01] funviking99: reader
[1:50:04] Lausten: @s7wede That worked with Warcraft 3 and Expansion, I got those on my battle net account
[1:50:06] NeeK_23: I keep my CD keys with my VHS tapes
[1:50:07] CrowMomocle: external cd drives with usb are pretty cheap
[1:50:14] thunduz: portalable disc drive my dude
[1:50:18] Lheela: i still have one from like 2007, went through three different cases by now lol
[1:50:31] S3N71: I've an external BluRay read/writer that's backward compatible with DVDs and CDs.  Yet to find something to burn to BluRay
[1:51:19] michaelmm: There's players that can transfer to USB/SD card out there.
[1:51:24] MachoCham: Naughty videos?
[1:51:25] MachoCham: Oh
[1:51:28] Dackor: Best thing to do is get a NAS drive and put either Plex or Jellyfin on, then rip all your media to it and watch anywhere
[1:51:41] thunduz: careful of the parents old harddrive photos
[1:51:46] ImperfectDark: i did not know where this story was going lol. Thought it was a private porn collection lmao
[1:51:55] Lausten: Put it in the cloud! OneDrive never loses data
[1:52:19] ImperfectDark: yeah, definitely a good idea to put that online
[1:52:29] RAF_Sean: It's like you're reading a list of WrestleDania's
[1:52:49] Lausten: @Dackor What if the house burns down?
[1:53:21] Borocil: turn the memories into a book for Christmas presents?
[1:53:29] Ironhide_Gaming: yes
[1:53:33] Ironhide_Gaming: wait what

[1:54:48] Lheela: have you ever considered that quartermasters are above eigthmasters in the corporate ladder, and have to report to halfmasters?
[1:55:08] chelfx: They been posting news at weird times this week
[1:55:17] HighLordRedhood: lol

[1:55:59] RAF_Sean: Oh shit it's Wednesday! Anjulee's monitor should be arriving
[1:56:20] S3N71: Have details about the severance packages leaked - are they looking after them?
[1:56:28] Lheela: oribos portal seems appropriate for horrific visions
[1:56:58] BE3njo: @Lheela true
[1:57:20] michaelmm: The Historians were part of Story and Franchise Development. AIUI the wow ones weren't affected.
[1:57:21] chelfx: bless adam
[1:57:35] Lheela: finding the npc is the real hardcore challenge
[1:57:39] magemaster225: whast the name of the npc?
[1:58:08] RAF_Sean: Maybe it's literally ANY in game character
[1:58:17] death_cam_: its in the maw
[1:58:29] handovdoom666: is there a specific SSF server or is it just the regular HC servers and you switch on SSF?
[1:58:43] dright424: The xp turn off npc in retail is a stealthed rogue, so it could be like that
[1:59:11] AlfredK: Is that the NPC where you can lock XP?
[1:59:35] chelfx: does say in game character so maybe its another person
[2:00:10] AlfredK: Have you checked like Goldshire?
[2:00:26] natch_looney: The mode blocks you getting assistance from other players, so maybe it is a player character you talk to
[2:00:43] chelfx: i can
[2:01:01] AlfredK: I can as well
[2:01:48] chelfx: im coming

[2:03:33] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:04:03] s7wede: It would need to be an NPC in both OG and Stormwind. Maybe check someone around the AH
[2:04:25] Shrandamar: probably an NPC in stormwind
[2:04:25] Ironhide_Gaming: dwarf warrior ftw
[2:04:33] Lheela: probably not yet in game?
[2:05:28] Haestoh: What's all this business about SOD catch up? Are they straight up giving people level 25's before P2?
[2:05:51] RAF_Sean: That would be great
[2:05:52] NeeK_23: exp buffs to 25
[2:06:07] S3N71: @imjoeski I

[2:06:43] Haestoh: I genuinely thought I read somewhere they were making it possible to create a level 25 template char at start of P2
[2:06:45] kaijoe_: Anyone else seeing 0 Trader's Tender after the NA restart?
[2:06:46] Lheela: the brainwashed noble is outside the instance
[2:06:49] Lheela: in the mines
[2:06:49] Haestoh: did i dream this?
[2:06:50] hedko7: where is the rare?
[2:06:58] Lausten: Those mogs are outside in the mine not in the actual dungeon :D
[2:06:59] s7wede: I am 12/12 Heroic Fyrakk kills. The legendary does not fucking exist!
[2:07:06] jcarman1998: Mage or Spriest at the minute for Mythic plus?
[2:07:09] S3N71: @imjoeski I'm in Friday night if you're running a BFD PuG.  Sat night too

[2:07:24] Lausten: Its a rare mob that can spawn in the tunnels before
[2:07:57] Lheela: but those two mogs are boe, you can get them for like 200k combined
[2:08:07] Lheela: maybe easier than farming an open world rare
[2:08:07] Haestoh: @S3N71 I'm normally quite erratic with times of play at weekends. But if I'm around I'll deffo put a group together.
[2:08:08] NeeK_23: our first HC kill dropped the legendary for a holy pala, she still hasnt made it since she cant use it. LuL
[2:08:13] S3N71: Is the P2 PvP event STV?
[2:08:23] S3N71: @S3N71 THanks man :)
[2:08:41] S3N71: DO we get a funky 50% mount?
[2:09:25] Xesol: what was the trick?
[2:10:16] MediumRareOG: i can't for the life of me do that achievement. it pisses me off
[2:10:23] Xesol: nice either way congrats lol
[2:10:27] NeeK_23: holy cant use 2handed

[2:10:42] Dackor: holy can use 2h int weapons
[2:11:03] MachoCham: Oh I need to do it but no idea on where to start
[2:11:04] NeeK_23: healer mains I guess
[2:11:38] Lausten: The one achievement I gave up on was the damn riding achievement at the estate place near Boralus..
[2:12:21] S3N71: @Lausten I remember that.  The horse jumping or something?
[2:13:02] Arlaeya: @Lausten Same. If I'm in the area, I usually curse it and move on.
[2:13:33] Lausten: Yeah the horse jumping one @S3N71
[2:14:25] AlfredK: Sitting at the PC with jeans is the fcking worst
[2:14:41] S3N71: Barbed wire pants, they'll keep you focused
[2:16:20] Lausten: Click the floating things
[2:16:44] AlfredK: I had like 250 attempts before I got both mounts
[2:16:45] NeeK_23: its miserable, we need a skip
[2:16:47] magemaster225: spine is going to make you lose sanity
[2:16:51] S3N71: Is that the irritating DeathWing fight ?
[2:17:00] Zuldak: there are 3 mounts in there
[2:17:07] MediumRareOG: THE SPINE IS PRETTY EASY ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT
[2:17:12] MediumRareOG: oops
[2:17:12] Zuldak: 2 drop off of deathwing

[2:33:08] Lakatarmen: *sarcasm*
[2:33:19] MachoCham: @Lausten How do you join the team? :D
[2:33:43] MediumRareOG: there could be a fall through the world and die bug in a weird spot in hinterlands and someone would say "no changes" to fixing it
[2:34:28] MediumRareOG: you cropped her feet off
[2:35:47] chelfx: Must show foot ofc /s

[2:37:55] OrthiadNick: You could just do it as "This cannot be activated again"

[2:40:19] NeeK_23: you just run through
[2:40:20] s7wede: stay on him
[2:40:21] Lausten: You're just supposed to RP it, not kill anything
[2:40:21] breninn3: Streamer so fast he reads chat before it even shows on my end LUL  Like having text-to-speech on
[2:40:31] AlfredK: You can't just kill them. You have to follow Illidan
[2:40:49] Lausten: @breninn3 Yeah my chat is also always behind
[2:40:54] LuiBMHunter: just run really really fast!
[2:41:04] MediumRareOG: i'd forgotten this dungeon existed
[2:41:11] LuiBMHunter: attacking might be a mistake
[2:41:19] Dokeefe1986: What is this lol
[2:41:28] amricatt: What is this dungeon?  I've never seen it.
[2:41:38] Elrathir: good ol billydan stormangry
[2:41:40] Dokeefe1986: I don't recall this
[2:41:54] MediumRareOG: i have a vague memory of doing this. no idea how or when. i probably only ever did it once
[2:42:20] RoronoaZoro20: cata dungeon
[2:42:29] chelfx: the 3 dragon soul dngs were fun, lot like the 5 man icc dngs  they all connect
[2:42:31] Arlaeya: It was part of the three you did to get the Dragon Soul
[2:42:34] NeeK_23: zero people asking for this in M+ lol
[2:42:53] Lakatarmen: its more like a scenario really
[2:42:57] Zuldak: I think halls of reflection is the worst M+ idea ever
[2:42:58] Ironhide_Gaming: whats the weekly?
[2:43:37] s7wede: I'm still waiting for Tol Dagor M+. The day they release that steaming pile is the day I quit
[2:43:38] chelfx: This was made for story showing us getting the world soul stone thingy for the raid
[2:43:40] Ironhide_Gaming: whats the reward?
[2:43:59] Bware2: normal
[2:44:01] Dokeefe1986: Oh now I recall this place. I hated it lolol
[2:44:04] NeeK_23: normal for 5 dungeons, heroic for the raid
[2:45:25] Tallara: Hello! I can't imagine the monumental task of trying to 100% complete WoW. But that is such an awesome idea mrgmToast

[2:47:19] Arlaeya: Nope, older war of the ancients
[2:47:28] chelfx: this is war the ancients i believe
[2:47:30] Arlaeya: it's when the well goes boom
[2:47:32] chelfx: 10 000 years before
[2:47:34] BBMezzy: Book lore
[2:47:50] Zuldak: no they are supposed to be hidden in the shadow
[2:47:54] NeeK_23: they shadowbats, so have no colour /s
[2:47:56] Zuldak: its a mechanic of this place
[2:47:58] Trustedlol: Naw, that was always the texture even when it was released
[2:47:59] RoronoaZoro20: too many recolor models the don't know what to pick :))
[2:48:04] s7wede: I think they have always looked like that.
[2:48:30] chelfx: you are atm what becomes melastorm
[2:48:31] AlfredK: Middle
[2:48:36] s7wede: The maelstrom
[2:48:41] Zuldak: its the maelstrom... cause it blew up
[2:48:43] MediumRareOG: ya know, DF only added half the mounts SL did
[2:48:43] NeeK_23: its the sundering
[2:48:46] s7wede: It blows up and becomes the Maelstrom
[2:48:51] Tallara: Yeah this is when the continents split
[2:48:51] Arlaeya: this is how it becomes the maelstrom
[2:48:56] Lausten: It blew up and split the continents in 2
[2:49:34] BBMezzy: Yes, you single-handedly caused the maelstrom. What do you have to say for yourself?
[2:49:55] chelfx: this takes place jsut before the raid i beleive
[2:49:57] s7wede: Hour of twilight
[2:50:04] Zuldak: this is the one with the priest guy at the end
[2:50:16] Arlaeya: POWAH
[2:50:31] amricatt: There's so many of these dungeons I've never done or seen.
[2:50:42] Tallara: I don't remember this either
[2:50:55] BBMezzy: I have a hard time remembering a lot of the cata dungeons and I did them plenty back then.. they apparently weren't very memorable
[2:51:29] amricatt: Speaking of story, I did the Ruby Life follower dungeon today for the first time.  I had a pretty good time.
[2:51:42] chelfx: I loved ZF and ZA dngs, fights where cool
[2:51:46] s7wede: When this was released, I made a youtube guide on it with my guild. It's been long since deleted because of copyright music, but it brings back memories lol
[2:52:27] MediumRareOG: what cata reps are you missing?
[2:52:33] S3N71: I just logged on to my NA account to pick up my tendies and the trading post is bugged, cannot communicate with the server.  Sadge
[2:53:16] MediumRareOG: yeah, avengers of hyjal is firelands
[2:53:17] Arlaeya: I just remember being happy Thrall moved faster than in Escape from Durnholde
[2:53:45] S3N71: Not been an issue before, maybe a glitch, I'll try again later
[2:54:45] Lausten: You probably quit when they added these at the end of the expansion
[2:54:49] MediumRareOG: Tol Bard can suck because people will still kill you there. On low pop realms you can just AFK And collect wins
[2:54:56] chelfx: It was added in with dragon soul, you did it once or twice for valour
[2:54:56] christoo420: omg i forgot this place
[2:55:01] Arlaeya: It was at the time I think

[2:58:45] MediumRareOG: and at the other end of the spectrum is me with 50 level 70s and 8 level 60s
[2:59:23] Hotstitute: ONLY POWAHH
[2:59:34] Arlaeya: PAH!!
[2:59:39] Lausten: Love the reference
[2:59:58] Hotstitute: ya, its a really weird quest line
[3:00:02] christoo420: you gonna try for mount off rag this week with timewalking FL. alot ppl doing skips
[3:00:08] MediumRareOG: I end up not picking up the drops and have to clear out 400 items in my mail every now and again
[3:00:52] nyrhalahotep: I get secondhand embarrassment when the old bosses monologue about how powerful they are, and then die mid word
[3:01:19] Lakatarmen: its an open bg
[3:01:31] S3N71: No Fly ZOne
[3:01:42] Lakatarmen: ofc u cant fly kek
[3:01:53] chelfx: you can pvp here
[3:02:16] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS Easier with Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[3:02:58] S3N71: Wasn't there supposed to be a flying PvP in one of the expansions way back?
[3:04:35] chelfx: I know this is a weird take but with dragon riding we dont spend time in lvling zones in DF just flying from place to place. i kinda miss just having ground mounts to start
[3:04:59] MediumRareOG: yes, it's an ICP reference
[3:05:00] Lausten: It is a reference to that
[3:06:04] chelfx: i think they may just scrap it and just unlocks as you lvl
[3:06:09] MediumRareOG: glyphs are already account wide. they may just leave it untouched
[3:06:27] Layliah79: prob make a questline to introduce you to it all
[3:06:44] Jack_the_Dipper: yarrHey
[3:06:54] Layliah79: sure it will be fine. better then what we had prior to DF for flying!
[3:07:03] Jack_the_Dipper: Goodmorning? D:
[3:07:12] Layliah79: sometimes afk flying is nice tho! :D
[3:07:13] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL

[3:07:16] Lakatarmen: why u cant fly in ghostlands, that beats me
[3:07:42] s7wede: It was never built for flying.
[3:07:47] chelfx: smoke and mirrors
[3:07:57] Jack_the_Dipper: I was a bit shocked and thought I had to go to work LUL
[3:07:57] s7wede: The building and architecture are not 3D. It's all facades
[3:08:09] chelfx: If you dont see it dont texture it
[3:08:25] MediumRareOG: i think argus is the same way
[3:08:26] Lakatarmen: sooooo, hope that will be remade soon kek
[3:08:33] s7wede: If you go there with a DH, you can break it so easily and it looks horrendous
[3:08:33] Layliah79: that's awesome!
[3:08:36] Lakatarmen: ah in midnight, makes sense
[3:08:54] ruuhll: but midnight is just a new zone or not? we go to the past
[3:08:56] nyrhalahotep: Magic
[3:09:11] Jack_the_Dipper: Do you think they should make the ink potion an option in the game to makke nights like real dark nights?
[3:09:14] adampanerabread: I don't think it'll matter but do we know if dragonriding will be 85% speed in the war within zones, or max speed?
[3:09:32] Layliah79: cause we're goin to Quel'Thalas then!
[3:09:45] RoronoaZoro20: because of u now im farming xmog on my hunter alt :)) ty tho :))
[3:09:59] MediumRareOG: I suspect TWW will be max speed dragonriding. they'll be designed for it like DF
[3:10:12] Layliah79: when we're doing the dragon races in the old zones - it's 100% speed right?
[3:10:22] S3N71: @MediumRareOG I concur
[3:10:34] s7wede: I'm betting they won't because of how the old zones are designed. It's probably limited by the speed and pop in of assets. If they wanted to remove the limitation they would need to touch up every single old zone
[3:10:41] Xesol: are NA auth servers jacked right now? i cant change realms without getting dc :(
[3:10:58] Jack_the_Dipper: Do you think they should make the ink black potion an option in the game to make nights like real dark nights?
[3:11:04] ruuhll: midnight come ending 2025?
[3:11:13] chelfx: when hasn't the ptr been broke lately
[3:11:17] S3N71: @Xesol I can't pick up tendies on NA
[3:11:40] chelfx: 10.2.5 felt like it was made by 5 people
[3:12:16] S3N71: @chelfx Whilst travelling to work, and then got dismissed last week :(
[3:12:23] BBMezzy: I've updated my 10.2.5 opinion from skeleton crew to intern
[3:12:30] Lakatarmen: youll be exalted long before u get to buy everything in the shop

[3:13:14] MediumRareOG: @Lakatarmen This ^^^. Tokens are the limiting factor
[3:13:25] lavatailss: Hey, just tuned in to the stream, not sure if you know, but there are different dailies between WM on and off on tol barad :) (or at least possible)
[3:13:28] Lausten: I got 2/5 credit after doing a single timewalking dungeon..
[3:14:16] lavatailss: it's the pve ones
[3:14:19] MediumRareOG: Different realms (including WM on and off) can get different Tol Barad dailies
[3:14:40] lavatailss: yes
[3:14:40] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:14:49] MediumRareOG: iirc yes
[3:15:01] MediumRareOG: you won't get a complete new set. you might have 2 extra ones
[3:15:49] MediumRareOG: If you do WM first then WM off, you'll get 1-3 extra ones
[3:15:55] lavatailss: the way I do it, I go in Wm on , grab them all, go back to sw, turnn wm off go back to TB, grab new ones if there are extra ones and then do all of them.
[3:15:56] MediumRareOG: it's just they have a different set of 8 with some overlap
[3:17:28] MediumRareOG: check the pvp zone. you can stand on the bridge at the entry and collect a win for 3 tokens if your timing is right. WM on and off are separate too
[3:17:38] lavatailss: it's not guaranteed sadly
[3:18:09] chelfx: have you done the raid?
[3:18:14] karklop: and you get 3 tokens every time you win a battle
[3:19:03] MediumRareOG: yes, always 3
[3:19:11] chelfx: i like the look of the building
[3:19:31] MediumRareOG: i would have 2 toons on different realms and switch between one realm and the other and WM on and off to collect wins
[3:19:58] karklop: and check wm on/off timers for the battle, sometimes the battle stars in one phase just right after the battle finished in the other phase
[3:20:17] MediumRareOG: as in one of my toons would invite the other if it was about to win
[3:20:52] MediumRareOG: no, you can absolutely cheese it with realm and WM hopping
[3:21:10] karklop: if you're attacking, you can finish the battle in 7,8 minutes
[3:21:22] karklop: if you're defending, it's 15 mins
[3:22:01] karklop: there's no boss, just capture/defend the 3 bases
[3:22:11] chelfx: you doing cata content making more excited for Cata classic lol
[3:22:52] chelfx: 14 years
[3:22:53] chelfx: 2010
[3:22:56] kuazi1: I missed the firelands raid, I want to do it!
[3:23:22] MediumRareOG: but dragon soul
[3:23:24] chelfx: cata was when i got really into wow
[3:23:49] karklop: just follow the main road
[3:23:52] karklop: it's a giant
[3:24:36] kuazi1: I was a holy pally for DS... it was the worst
[3:24:39] Jack_the_Dipper: I consider myself smelly
[3:24:47] s7wede: Think of us who were born in the 80's. The true lost generation lol
[3:24:49] Jack_the_Dipper: ow
[3:24:56] MediumRareOG: you'll get exalted long before you have enough tokens
[3:25:21] S3N71: <---  1966.  I'll just go set fire to myself now, save on the cremation costs

[3:43:01] Elrathir: gotta have the planty armoredon
[3:43:10] Elembry_us: It would make more sense
[3:43:20] chelfx: isnt that for delves
[3:43:22] Elrathir: wasn't that from delves?
[3:43:23] chelfx: no m+
[3:43:25] BBMezzy: That's for delves
[3:43:26] Shrandamar: that was from Delves
[3:43:26] chelfx: not*
[3:43:31] Layliah79: Delves
[3:43:34] Neostigma: it was for delves
[3:43:36] Shrandamar: M+ probably get some random cat
[3:43:42] MachoCham: A horse
[3:43:47] chelfx: shitty ground mount ofc
[3:43:48] Elrathir: Hopefully a dragon :)
[3:43:48] Neostigma: a spider
[3:43:51] Layliah79: I'd love more cat mounts, just saying!
[3:44:02] BBMezzy: A bicycle, moves at 50% mount speed
[3:44:02] KrystalBella: @chelfx ^^
[3:44:03] Layliah79: Sunwarmed Furline is my fav mount
[3:44:07] Harai_Ulfsark: we'll get earthen rams
[3:44:07] Neostigma: A floating sword
[3:44:13] CpnRad: bring back the creepily uncanny spider mounts
[3:44:16] Elrathir: maybe we'll get an extra large Earthen to ride around on
[3:44:40] chelfx: You fought with blood and sweat to win this
[3:44:45] Neostigma: that was a close match...
[3:45:30] tacohands: I felt like this took forever back in the day to get the currency to buy the mount and tabard.
[3:45:55] chelfx: 55 days to more excact
[3:46:20] chelfx: you enough for nothing
[3:46:44] tacohands: Wow I thought my forever might have been an exaggeration but now I see it wasn't.

[3:48:19] MachoCham: Lunar Festival starts on the 3rd
[3:48:23] MachoCham: Wonder if there will be changes
[3:48:25] Elrathir: man... now I actually want an Extra Large Earthen as a mount... with it moving around like the big murloc mount, or the werebear
[3:48:27] tacohands: I had been doing the Argent Tournament on my hunter only to discover there is paladin only mount that only shows up if you are a paladin. So now I feel like I have been wasting my hunter time.
[3:48:32] chelfx: we did geta pirate themed pet from prime just saying
[3:48:37] Shrandamar: they had to get rid of Mike because he didnt believe in the pirates
[3:48:41] MediumRareOG: "off stream" -> Dan's buying Argent Touranemnt boosts on Chinese websites LULW
[3:49:06] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:49:08] Elrathir: how mysterious
[3:49:22] Layliah79: Saturday is Feb 3rd
[3:49:31] Neostigma: is that 2nd march or 3rd of feb ?
[3:49:37] Layliah79: LOL
[3:49:44] Layliah79: maybe it's your dates that are silly :P
[3:49:58] MediumRareOG: the american date thing is so stupid
[3:50:19] chelfx: Atleast you dont live in canada where people use both
[3:50:32] Neostigma: I thought it was Ceasar
[3:50:34] CpnRad: also join the metric system like the rest of the world (please ignore that we use 3 different systems to measure in the UK)
[3:50:36] Elrathir: that's true lore
[3:50:37] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:50:40] MediumRareOG: An American named Jim Calendar invented the calendar
[3:50:44] snaeks: I can confirm that, I was in the room when the king said it
[3:50:45] CrowMomocle: The Americans do say the 4th of July
[3:50:55] Layliah79: Stare
[3:50:56] CrowMomocle: 4th before month
[3:51:04] S3N71: They tipped our tea in the harbour.  Cunts.  Just saying
[3:51:20] Layliah79: July of 4th doesn't make sense to say KEKW
[3:51:22] chelfx: waste of good tea
[3:51:41] Akela3: In our defense, the tea was pretty crap
[3:51:46] Darkuwa: If date is first and you sort files with the date in them you need to make a new folder every month instead of every year
[3:51:49] CpnRad: i think its broken
[3:51:52] Harai_Ulfsark: the hitboxes are bugged tbh
[3:52:12] MachoCham: ISO date format is the best for that
[3:52:24] MediumRareOG: yyyy-mm-dd makes sense. dd-mm-yyyy makes sense. mm-dd-yyyy makes no sense
[3:52:25] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Send your pet up to kill him.
[3:52:28] Darkuwa: should be year first
[3:52:33] MachoCham: YY - MM - DD
[3:52:35] Harai_Ulfsark: for file names i just use YYYY/MM/DD
[3:52:40] Darkuwa: yah, that's how japan does it
[3:52:40] MachoCham: That's the ISO standard
[3:52:43] S3N71: In their defence, when I make changes to documents at work, I use year - month - day format as it's the easiest way to track changes
[3:52:50] Neostigma: year month day in japan yup
[3:53:41] itsbsprout: what is your overall %
[3:53:55] MediumRareOG: i dread the "wow to video essay" pipeline because 90% of thejm turn into massive transphobes and/or racists
[3:54:32] Harai_Ulfsark: yes i know
[3:54:42] MediumRareOG: punkrat, for example
[3:55:20] MediumRareOG: punkrat created a channel called the Liveral Hivemind where he loves Trump
[3:55:32] CpnRad: he has a channel called Liberal Hivemind
[3:55:46] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM

[3:59:05] CpnRad: what a time to be sat on 5000 tendies
[3:59:10] MediumRareOG: i'm glad they're giving extra tendies
[3:59:10] BE3njo: damn ngl this month sucks, 2 seater mount for 100 tendies is awesome tho
[3:59:18] Neostigma: Wonder how it will look on a male dreanei
[3:59:22] Layliah79: those pets are cheaper then normal
[3:59:34] S3N71: Got the rocket, nothing else jumps out at me.  I'll get the rocket on my NA account I guess
[3:59:35] Layliah79: i think so
[3:59:35] Neostigma: dummy maybe
[3:59:37] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Is the rocket green?
[3:59:53] Layliah79: u become a mannequin like at the Trading post
[3:59:59] CpnRad: riding that in 11.0 with dragonflight riding is gonna be great
[4:00:09] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I've got the refer one and the love drop ones (pink).  So that makes me relax.
[4:00:21] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: There's not many 2-people flying mounts.
[4:01:08] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Last month had a fox too
[4:01:13] itsbsprout: I had the rocket from my old account I had when I was a kid, so glad to have that back
[4:01:27] S3N71: I'll probably get the flying fox as well. for Firefox
[4:01:42] Neostigma: I do like the way they discount items though, hope that is a new trande,.
[4:01:45] Neostigma: trend
[4:01:50] BBMezzy: The prices seem more reasonable for the first time in a long time
[4:02:07] Neostigma: In my eyes they should discount any of the previous year items.
[4:02:15] itsbsprout: yeah the pets aren't 600 a piece thank god
[4:02:17] chelfx: it looks the same
[4:02:21] FranciscoTheMage: hello mr gm
