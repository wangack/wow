[0:40:46] BigBlackJeezus: Any one specifically where you wouldnt swap convoke for tree ?
[0:40:51] lillejohnn: is convoke still the play for lower dungs ?
[0:41:05] hopiums: Hey jdot, just got into wow and made a resto druid as my main, just hit my first +7 and was wondering.. when it comes to talent trees, are the cookie cutter ones from wowhead/icyveins good enough?
[0:41:45] Grasshoppa117: probably yes for anything under 10
[0:42:10] Rebeksy: surely those are good enough for 20s easily?
[0:43:39] Grasshoppa117: brocoli a must these days ?
[0:43:56] zamow1994: brocoli is only really good in higher keys
[0:44:04] zamow1994: for your weekly keys it's pretty useless
[0:44:06] hopiums: Okay sweet, i assume certain dungeons on certain weeks agree with different talent choices?
[0:44:11] BigBlackJeezus: i guess for tree and convoke its also how it "feels" in the key for yourself
[0:44:23] nikator1: you know youre in a resto druid stream when ppl start arguing over broccoli idk what ur even referring to lol
[0:44:36] BigBlackJeezus: KEKW

[2:13:49] nikator1: F
[2:14:23] OrieleHS: @dhuckla I believe the blast does 25% of her health per hit and hits 3 times. an external does help. not sure why she would have died on the first one though
[2:14:47] OrieleHS: or maybe it's 30% i forget exactly
[2:15:06] dhuckla: Only thing I could think of is someone messed up the soak? But no one died but her.
[2:17:22] easymeld: yes its 25% if u soak
[2:17:31] easymeld: if u dont then she or some1 dies

[6:00:53] basherbash32: No way someone is paying 1M for that trinket
[6:01:00] basherbash32: 200k is decent
[6:01:18] beladewow: he doesnt know KEKW

[6:01:52] honeyyyyyy: i got the legendary on an alt...and im not just not gonna spend 750k and 2 days of grinding to use it. what a stupid requirement
[6:02:03] dragona92: @averykristian He has 7800x3d, cache works very good in World of Warcraft
[6:02:29] basherbash32: I got heroic Pips last night and a boomy paid 100k for one because two of them dropped

[6:03:48] basherbash32: Do what Max does. Fill a raid with viewers who pump and they will trade the trinket to you
[6:04:00] globzim: prob with Tindral is that there are not really good stuff from him other than Bello
[6:04:04] averykristian: ooh great price, i'll look into it
[6:04:14] therealborko: jesus I have a 7900X and I dont get that
[6:04:29] therealborko: didn't know the x3d would make that much of a difference
