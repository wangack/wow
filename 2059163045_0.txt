[3:02:19] sparKoz: cant shadowstep and kick or stun, its awkward
[3:02:41] dickyroberts: Lock tank is just as bad as warr
[3:02:41] Onlyfishguts: Shadowstep is on gcd now
[3:02:48] p3anots: Paladin runes are lame, mana regen taking up one slot and everything on other slot is just trash Sadge
[3:02:54] sicklr: as a lvl 28 warrior rn running dungeons to level. is duel wielding with a. dagger in off hand better than 2 1h swords? or is 2h smackin?
[3:03:10] ogMansoN: paladins got their whole kit phase 1, i  dont want to hear  it
[3:03:11] FIip_: wtf? paladin runes r op af

[3:05:09] Dreddmar: lacksidasial?
[3:05:18] p3anots: Crusader strike + divine storm is just mortal strike + wirlwind but a worse version of each, didnt complain P1 though. P2 runes are ASS thoguh
[3:05:19] handpickedbytim: @djp1wow ah, so if theres a closet up, anyone can use it?

[3:06:30] Photoelectric: sonii you gotta link this mix rn this is too good
[3:06:36] p3anots: Raging blow literally does more damage than crusader strike AFTER getting nerfed, and that's 1/3 of our abilities, raging blow is only a small part of warriors
[3:06:46] JayBud: link for classic imorph ?
[3:07:00] moflrofl: 100a armor
[3:07:06] momofallsandbdo: YOOO BLOOD MOOON COME THRU
[3:07:11] DakotaHasHands: LUL
[3:07:12] Elementalitytv: LULW
[3:07:12] DakotaHasHands: that name
[3:07:23] dickyroberts: its not worth playing on this server....... the general public has ruined sod for me
[3:07:33] Elementalitytv: p3 is a warrior propagandist
[3:07:37] Quigles: paladin propaganda will not be tolerated
[3:07:38] PastafarianProposals: pallies are meh
[3:07:52] GTokie: sonii you know what would be so sick, get a team of like 10 mages or so and mass aoe farm that room of alliance

[3:08:44] Photoelectric: not sharing this mix with chat is a hate crime lmao
[3:08:49] Retlul: Warrs still goign to be top dps, but I do agree their runes are meeeh
[3:08:56] SONII: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xPG1Hb8PII
[3:09:04] Elementalitytv: it's okay warriors have always ebeen gear dependent, theyll slap soon

[3:09:08] Photoelectric: thanks fam
[3:09:19] muchtar92: you guys dont get it
[3:09:29] htch1: enraged regen and bloodsurge are pretty cool i think
[3:09:29] muchtar92: the runes dont realy make the gamply fun
[3:09:36] DakotaHasHands: you had yours on?
[3:09:38] GTokie: isnt that just a warrior thing, just smash
[3:09:39] DakotaHasHands: couldnt be me
[3:09:39] kindNifti: do it
[3:09:40] tgrass597: go for it!
[3:09:42] p3anots: I agree that warrior runes could be a little more fun, just add fun stuff then twerk numbers, paladin just needs a buff to the actual numbers of abilities. Crusader strike to 90% weapon damage is an example
[3:09:54] limburgse: go for it, we chill with you :)
[3:10:01] DakotaHasHands: your brain
[3:10:09] Elementalitytv: you can get away with that the tunes are A1

[3:10:43] FIip_: This man is smoking, Paladin is in a great spot especially ret.
[3:10:49] sparKoz: you get bloodsurge yet? seems like a pretty good damage output ability
[3:10:55] htch1: im loving mutilate rogue atm
[3:11:04] p3anots: You can make anything fun then just twink numbers, idk why they dont do that with warrior but give them op shit, then all the fun stuff is shit LUL
[3:11:06] elementzia: bladeeeestormmmmm!
[3:11:09] FIip_: Literally the only issue paladin had was our CS/DS didn't proc windfury and they fixed that.
[3:11:12] miceralol: Boomkins are busted imo
[3:11:13] hypnoidal: DK abilities maybe?
[3:11:26] XPunchlineX: range warr

[3:11:48] RamboSupreme: I still love the spear abaility from Shadowlands for warriors best thing since charge
[3:11:52] DakotaHasHands: spell warrior runes
[3:11:55] Tenderly_Entering: should give wars devestate
[3:12:19] bede232: Banger song!
[3:12:19] htch1: image if whenever warriors crit they would throw their weapon and inflict base weapon dmg
[3:12:26] king_slinki: @Tenderly_Entering they have it
[3:12:27] sparKoz: getting overpower procs from rend should be in the game
[3:12:28] BroccoliTom: @SONII this might be copium, but no meme.  I feel like warrior at least still has it's identity at this point.  it feels like a warrior XD
[3:12:36] CAD604: think youll run the spriest after you hit 40? or chill on warr for a bit

[3:16:11] SwitzzyGames: hows rogue pvp at 40?
[3:16:20] Its_Sainty: oh i agree
[3:16:28] LuxzGaming: maybe they are saving it all for later phases
