[1:22:41] plethoric: You're gonna be disappointed by the Putin interview.  It has nothing to do with political slant.  It was his version of history from like 800AD with no other substance.
[1:22:50] Maruika: we are just really lucky the good guys have never lost a single war
[1:22:51] asdft90: That Putin interview was like an IQ test, anyone that wasn't skeptical of the words out of Putin's mouth clearly isn't all that bright.

[3:34:16] gressil1234: pvp in sod is so bad, all casters need HUGE nerfs
[3:34:39] yoitshesi: @gressil1234 youre saying this while watching the dead caster kek
[3:34:41] PoliteHeathen: are you really already exalted with WSG?
[3:34:42] ATcaribou: unfortunately it wasnt added to make the event better, it as only added to stop the graveyard farm.
[3:35:04] Nightbot: @Celz22 -> LANGUAGE VIOLATION [warning]
[3:35:21] Celz22: ah cool

[3:38:20] stubbledorange: @pupu420 they hotfixed it. when you rez you're basically an honorless target
[3:38:23] kaldom: What classes seem really scarry atm?
[3:38:31] n3veRMiND: @Celz22 what did u say to get it deleted?

[3:40:19] X_Beany_X: ty!
[3:40:31] sinnsear6: hmmm
[3:40:37] stubbledorange: i mean a group of 5 vs everyone else? @Terywow you won't win a single fight in all liklihood
[3:41:12] stubbledorange: if you're solo*
[3:41:25] Terywow: I mean that’s true
[3:41:33] sinnsear6: @stubbledorange lets be honest @StaysafeTV doesnt hardly know any of the ppl he is currently grouped with.
[3:42:14] stubbledorange: i don't see how thats relevant to my point tbh lmao no offense
[3:42:25] NickTew: ive been guildless this whole time I need to find a home
[3:42:46] NickTew: okay :)
[3:42:53] sinnsear6: @stubbledorange it's not i just like pointing out streamer privilege

[3:44:02] jbarish: its sobad
[3:44:05] sinnsear6: when they laugh... thats when u know
[3:44:14] dovahtv_: classic
[3:44:16] ThoR294: @jbarish its pvp not pve
[3:44:18] AlphaSimply: spy is basically walls, you can target wherever youre at :)
[3:44:18] ThoR294: thats the difference
[3:44:25] stubbledorange: @Butterthebun grats!
[3:44:26] TheseDaysLIVE: we got 168 points
[3:44:27] Xammy0: has anyone tried a raid group to see the penalities"?
[3:44:30] helmetnach0s: this is like team deathmatch. But annoying as fuck
[3:44:30] NoahDoesRP: streamer perks lol
[3:44:35] Lionkingler1: this is some insane clown fiesta
[3:44:38] stubbledorange: @Xammy0 thats what i wanna know! lmao
[3:44:40] Spoofy_TV: ashenvale sucked
[3:44:44] Zetherior: this is better looking
[3:44:50] ThoR294: better concept
[3:44:51] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV this is pvp. but it looks like a complete shitshow so far
[3:44:53] mynamajeff1998: what is his nameplates
[3:44:53] toogoo: alot better to watch
[3:44:54] Xammy0: yeah what if a 20 man raid is better overall
[3:44:56] ThoR294: ashenvale was literally shit
[3:44:57] Xammy0: even with penalities
[3:45:15] XarcTV: do u have to turn in before times up?
[3:45:15] TheSanguist: I think when you die, you should get a stacking buff that persists through death, empowering you.   So the more you die, the bigger a threat you become.   Then make you worth more points, but also way harder to kill.
[3:45:16] paulshagy: would of been sick to do some sort of arathi pvp zone
[3:45:20] Fetch22: do you think the duration of debuff is too long?
[3:45:23] sinnsear6: Where is the Blood champion?
[3:45:24] flickstick: they def gotta get rid of res timers for this
[3:45:33] Fakomi: i mean the event is probably getting a hotfix every other day like ashenvale. Hopefully they work out the kinks
[3:45:37] stubbledorange: @TheSanguist hard tho because that basically incentivizes you to die
[3:45:48] sinnsear6: @Fakomi what kinks?
[3:45:48] Xammy0: @TheSanguist then have a homie kill you over and over until you're giga buffed and then group up? lol
[3:45:51] Bombadil_7: nice
[3:46:01] ThoR294: KEKW
[3:46:06] Bombadil_7: the pvp is good in STV then, yes?
[3:46:07] harvenius: lol
[3:46:09] QuestFor420: hahahahahah
[3:46:12] OptimusBanana420: EZ
[3:46:20] kyidentity: not even the hate watchers
[3:46:23] inflictawarlock: just let out a wild fart

[3:46:43] stubbledorange: THE TREES ARE TALKING
[3:46:48] Voidbonx: they dont suspect a thing
[3:46:51] Metaphix: they agent oranged your ass
[3:46:51] ThoR294: nice big 1200 starsurge to your face
[3:46:52] castle_milk: hearing a tree sneeze is a bade squeeze
[3:46:57] Wingsofjanitor: napalm the entire jungle NODDERS
[3:47:08] revora_: MOONKINS UNITE 🌙
[3:47:19] feelinchrisp: just sit in booty bay
[3:47:23] Synmachus: The Stormwind elite should just burn this shithole to a crisp
[3:47:40] siilver40: Do you get more honor or like a reward depending on your blood stack amount or what is this about?
[3:47:43] Lionkingler1: YEP thats how we got our epic items
[3:47:49] ThoR294: you cant
[3:47:52] creaturesfan72: cant unfortunately
[3:47:57] stubbledorange: @StaysafeTV whats the penalty for being in a raid?
[3:47:58] dugdimmadomed: Screenshot and report
[3:47:59] Mawshaw: The giant troll boss should be running around tbh, when I saw him he was just standing still
[3:47:59] Lionkingler1: impossible
[3:48:08] killrog__: they're gonna ban collusion like they banned gdkp
[3:48:09] clay024: Anti-trust enforcement actions. Treble damages.
[3:48:11] ThoR294: yeah that troll has to move around and fuck shit up
[3:48:13] stubbledorange: @Mawshaw isn't he supposed to pat the whole area?
[3:48:14] Multar_: You could make it unable to kill guildies
[3:48:17] sinnsear6: @Mawshaw What's his name?
[3:48:25] Spoofy_TV: why dont u just farm ur friends if its free for all?
[3:48:30] ummish: make a raid
[3:48:40] Mawshaw: @stubbledorange Idk I thought so too but I saw him standing doing nothing
[3:48:53] Terywow: Should make it like the warden in BO2 and make it chase people LOL
[3:49:11] lnypnk: Just got here. whats unplayable?
[3:49:30] stubbledorange: he must be bugged because even the announcement said hes gonna run around the area.
[3:49:57] stubbledorange: or they're taking it easy on everyone for the first few days
[3:50:22] Lionkingler1: getting farmed isnt fun. Who would have guessed
[3:50:25] sinnsear6: @stubbledorange Kappa
[3:50:25] loki_a: they nerfed coins into the floor right?
[3:50:37] Zetherior: you could use a ramping decay aura to prevent teaming.. if you stay within 200 yards of a player for more than 30sec then you both take ramping damage till one dies @StaysafeTV
[3:50:39] mysteriousm4n: crazy that blizz made the event less fun in under a day, thank god for the devs
[3:50:59] feelinchrisp: killing players give more, killing mobs gives way less
[3:51:03] killrog__: high level tiggers gives 3 blood
[3:51:04] loki_a: did they not read before that it is for pvp and pve while blood moon is active?
[3:51:04] sticksaredrifting: aoe farm trolls yep
[3:51:06] Lionkingler1: time to grind some mobs then
[3:51:10] hasloa: Do you lose all current coins on death?
[3:51:14] killrog__: i farmed 200 blood on tiggers this morning
[3:51:17] markja629: sO if you don't have friends or a guild, you're just going to get farmed here?
[3:51:23] hasloa: Nice thanks!
[3:51:40] sinnsear6: @markja629 SeemsGood
[3:51:40] GavriilArchAngel: isnt it 10%
[3:51:42] Wilbo007: i love how they were like we are going to discourage grouping
[3:51:43] ATcaribou: @markja629 its so easy to type /4 looking for 5 man for STV event
[3:51:47] Lionkingler1: 40 man and kill some hyper spawn mob
[3:51:54] QuestFor420: lol
[3:52:14] Voidbonx: D:
[3:52:18] sargent_baddy: NO!
[3:52:40] Multar_: 190
[3:52:44] Bearrdman: is this event better than ashenvale?
[3:52:54] mysteriousm4n: I tried doing but multiple 5 man 40 groups camped turn in/grave yard and killed you with debuff still on LUL
[3:53:07] kushed419: why not kill for the sake of pissing turn off lol
[3:53:13] sargent_baddy: @Bearrdman well considering if you did this event less than 12 hours ago you got free epics its trash
[3:53:27] daveyrog: you would think its impossible to make a worst even than ashenvale but never doubt blizzard
[3:53:42] Lionkingler1: KEKW
[3:53:43] batmern_: both pvp events have been lame
[3:53:48] electric_f33l: KEKW
[3:54:07] Bearrdman: KEKW
[3:54:11] sinnsear6: hmmm
[3:54:13] Wingsofjanitor: LICKA blood points
[3:54:24] ATcaribou: @batmern_ first one was blizzards fault, this one is players optimizing the fun out of the event in the first 2 hours that ruined it
[3:54:26] Bearrdman: that was a great soundboard
[3:54:31] Osmosi: This one has potential still at least
[3:54:32] Voidbonx: shrek fanclub
[3:54:40] sargent_baddy: I think no grouping whatsoever in this would be better
[3:54:48] ThoR294: @Bearrdman its the discord nitro benefit via the swamp discord KEKW when you join voice channels it plays that
[3:55:04] sargent_baddy: people would collude but the pvp would be better and you would end up killing your friends which is hilarious
[3:55:15] Munch1616: Hey I was just trying to shake ur hand
[3:55:17] Xammy0: how many coins for a mount?
[3:55:17] batmern_: @ATcaribou true

[3:55:29] Vocox23: it's a rune
[3:55:30] lethalkingr: guys shadow priest mage or enh shaman for PvP and pve?
[3:55:35] mysteriousm4n: 10000 @Xammy0
[3:55:35] stubbledorange: gotta be a rune
[3:55:36] Mawshaw: It's the tanking rune @StaysafeTV
[3:55:37] Munch1616: Tell Rajj he getting killed first.
[3:55:40] sinnsear6: hmmm

[3:56:48] Tenuo_11: just unflag you for 30s
[3:56:50] MFpatrix: that prolly could be abused heavily
[3:56:58] Pewee1988: Seems like STv went from FUN pvp to Rage pvp :(
[3:56:58] toogoo: yea give everyone a chance to just untoggle pvp too
[3:57:04] lanayiadk: Bad idea
[3:57:24] anrupwns: untoggle pvp in an area made mainly for pvp lol
[3:57:33] stubbledorange: i mean at the very least give them 5 secs of resource free casting like in later xpac BGs
[3:57:36] SuicidalSquirrel: Wouldn't people use the bubble to storm main cities and hold a room
[3:57:37] SoderNable: How much rep do you get per blood turnin?
[3:57:46] Lionkingler1: run them down?
[3:57:51] Zetherior: 10s immune, 200% move speed
[3:57:56] Multar_: you need to make it so you can't spells
[3:58:21] lanayiadk: It's just not fun to fight someone who's immune for 30 sec.
[3:58:29] Jibulol: SCHIZO
[3:58:32] Kappa_Boyz: ????
[3:58:37] XarcTV: cant click debuffs yea
[3:58:38] GavriilArchAngel: what if i convince my friend for give me some blood
[3:58:39] aBadOtter: it should just rez people at random ghosts during the event so it spreads poeple out and you cant camp
[3:58:42] Xammy0: @lanayiadk you wouldnt be fighting them, they shouldnt be able to attack you either
[3:58:50] Mawshaw: @lanayiadk You wouldn't be fighting them, that's the point
[3:58:51] stubbledorange: you shouldn't be fighting them anyway
[3:58:53] sinnsear6: grats inzi
[3:59:17] keepcalmngame: Who was first to 40?
[3:59:24] endraga1: it fades once you use an ability
[3:59:35] agixtated: this event actually sucks
[3:59:37] mysteriousm4n: they should delete the event and give everyone the epics for free :)
[3:59:41] agixtated: its just stv
[3:59:58] KungKotz: immune to take dmg & deal dmg for 1 min
[3:59:59] Kappa_Boyz: glizzyL
[4:00:04] Sindakai88: just have you unflagged from pvp during that time instead of an immunity bubble
[4:00:05] stubbledorange: @STREAMSNIPELUL free opener?
[4:00:17] mattykek: reported
[4:00:21] stankypanky22: these guys are cringe wtf

[4:00:41] Xammy0: cdank clever user of in-game mechanics hmmmm
[4:00:45] sargent_baddy: people were getting all the items in like 3 events its so dumb
[4:00:57] ntb712: can someone explain win trading like I’m 6yo
[4:00:59] jbarish: this is worse than ashenvale
[4:01:00] stankypanky22: @sargent_baddy same happened in ashenvale it doesnt matter
[4:01:03] reefo: it doesn't matter what incentive, ppl just gonna kill u on sight
[4:01:05] Voidbonx: are we having fun? YEP
[4:01:06] theradoor: being able to steal from somebody is stupid
[4:01:11] theradoor: can be abused so hard

[4:01:23] sinnsear6: @sargent_baddy not staysafe.

[4:01:48] Link9286: you should be phased for 30sec after you res - cant see others and they cant see you

[4:02:42] mysteriousm4n: thanks for the great event blizz
[4:02:48] loki_a: as usual, humans their own worst enemies

[5:00:33] k1ngdyl: LOCKED BASEDHALT
[5:00:34] 0sikS: kind of a war-lock
[5:00:38] XarcTV: max 60/40 allowed i think
[5:00:39] boostedeg93: i wish you could have horde and alliance on the same server
[5:00:40] beaunerparte95: lol they are doing that?
[5:00:40] stubbledorange: can ally not make alts right now?
[5:00:43] bboofit: i think thats exactly how they're doing it
[5:00:44] mirakelkuren: What do you think about making both factions on the same realm?
[5:00:50] NooleanB: Introducing a 3rd faction could be cool, except for the fracturing of the commmunity
[5:00:50] aengelmonhster: I can't play tho
[5:00:55] kasualkaliber: that is true
[5:00:55] aengelmonhster: :(

[5:01:58] aoe_enjoyer: its live live
[5:02:16] fuzzysucculent: what rune is this for?
[5:02:30] misfitstv1: surely it would make more sense to characterise an account as horde or alliance as they can only be longed in on one character as a time. so they could track game time per faction and then make it for that faction is always open to that account till they need to balance
[5:02:34] milkiiya: i haven’t logged in since p2 started and everyone already 40…
[5:02:41] QuestFor420: not no moe
[5:02:55] stubbledorange: @misfitstv1 pvp servers used to be one faction per pvp realm not sure when that changed

[6:30:42] eraser9: @StaysafeTV what u think about Winter Squid farm for gold now in phase 2?
[6:30:45] DvOlii: it shouldnt get you more shard for the same person , no ?
[6:30:48] tsetse2fly: @Dangitsmcg you get a debuff for 1 min where you don't give any blood coins if you rez at gy
[6:30:52] Lionkingler1: wintrading in a rated pvp content is banable not this fiesta event
[6:30:57] doylactus: it prob works like honor can only kill so many times for value
[6:30:57] XarcTV: theyll make it so you get less the more you kill the same person, like honor
[6:31:07] statement__: surprised there aren't diminishing returns on the bloods, specifically for win trading
[6:31:18] Vicente_Prime: COINS
[6:31:19] feelinchrisp: devs literally stated on camera its not allowed so good luck
[6:31:20] Vicente_Prime: MORE COINS

[6:32:13] SneakyChalupa: garbage Diablo 4 themed mode?
[6:32:14] coreoh: Killing blows with rune abilities dont count !!
[6:32:40] pretty_cool_guy: the event was alright but the wintraders forced them to make a nerf that ruined it
[6:33:10] Mawshaw: Completely false LULW
[6:33:13] coreoh: Its bugged apparently
[6:33:17] rullehjem: @pretty_cool_guy how did they change it?
[6:33:17] Pwnoqraphy: @StaysafeTV bro, your group need the lasthit^^
[6:33:34] Mawshaw: I was getting killing blows ONLY with rune ability and got blood every time
[6:33:34] pretty_cool_guy: @rullehjem they nerfed the coins and the ways you can get them
[6:33:43] swingler93: just double checking, all players in a party get a share of blood things?
[6:33:49] aoe_enjoyer: would you ever level a shadow priest
[6:33:50] Lunights: or needs the tag
[6:34:03] Rockzam: @pretty_cool_guy what did they do?
[6:34:07] voodough: Teaming up with other group destroys the whole purpose honestly
[6:34:12] thcbh: OMEGALUL

[6:34:18] flawless_jv: kill em fuck it lol
[6:34:20] Synmachus: BASEDRETARD
[6:34:25] bustted_: your group only will get coins for kills so the other groups u guys are colluding with wont get coins if u kill and vice versa
[6:34:41] pretty_cool_guy: @Rockzam they nerfed the amount you get and added an honorless target thing and right now you can see there's some bug preventing them from even getting coins half the time
[6:34:45] broodjedollo: boomkins looking sick in pvp
[6:34:46] ez2crazy_: @StaysafeTV payo was doing the event and they give him 40 blood per kill how you getting just 12
[6:35:04] romoromainiac: what does the rez buff do?
[6:35:17] P33tDay10: THe point is to piss em off

[6:36:02] zacherack: in an add if you answer
[6:36:06] holyfiddle: @ez2crazy_ ah dunno then was gonna say maybe its diminishing return if more people tag or something
[6:36:18] Pwnoqraphy: you can get points i think, you are just not worth it
[6:36:19] Rafaelfrost_: good morning legend
[6:36:21] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I think you can get coins with debuff, just not give to players killing you
[6:36:33] MuRRRkn: @ez2crazy_ pretty sure they noticed a lot of shit for the event
[6:36:41] zacherack: how does the event work?
[6:36:43] MuRRRkn: hotfixed*
[6:37:01] oledu_: 1 minute semms like too long
[6:37:20] botjuan1: @zacherack make 4   5 man groups and stay next to eachother and kill everyone, take turns letting each group get a killing blow. and then you get the reward
[6:37:38] zacherack: @botjuan1 thank you
[6:37:47] botjuan1: yeah seems really fun
[6:38:23] zacherack: seems like range will dominate
[6:38:37] TesservcT: @botjuan1 toxic
[6:38:40] sydale: this event is still layered right?
[6:38:44] Mawshaw: Seen druids absolutely deleting people
[6:38:50] TheDastardlyD: just imagine being able to go SL/SL

[8:58:44] 4ddic7: o ja
[8:58:48] The_Crane: You gonna visit that tank in jail or what?
[8:58:55] MrPink604: whats the highest level you cna be and still get exp from bfd?
[8:58:55] baade123: is it worth for a lvl 30 to do blood moon event? or waste of time
[8:58:57] NaManDatAintMe: oh realm time
[8:58:58] NaManDatAintMe: im dumb
[8:58:59] Humansoup: sstvKING sstvKING
[8:59:11] tsetse2fly: @MrPink604 39
[8:59:14] Railgunnar: are you going to strike crack?
[8:59:32] Maxifrog: How's the new runes? Any missing or haven't been found yet?
[8:59:39] maddie_1994: Aw man
[8:59:44] lizcat_: dammit no crack :(
[8:59:53] Xahvion: @all where does the new worldbuff from gnome drop?
[8:59:53] tsetse2fly: @MrPink604 nvm, I acually don't know if you still get boss xp at 39.
[8:59:54] Andiells: even king of jungle is discovered yet?
[8:59:57] The_Crane: @tsetse2fly at what lvl do you start nerfing people's xp? Like.if.im lvl 31 and everyone else is 25
[8:59:58] Metaphix: tf
[9:00:05] Xahvion: for allianz
[9:00:06] Turtlesoc: season of discovery has minimal discovering in it huh
[9:00:11] Maxifrog: sick
[9:00:16] lizcat_: last I saw there was only one warlock rune left to find
[9:00:55] feelinchrisp: everythings been found
[9:01:02] parkrangerpeter: SoD is great, the playerbase is what sucks imo
[9:01:04] lizcat_: it’s actually perfect for mom and dad gamers
[9:01:20] XarcTV: pve no balance enforced
[9:01:23] feelinchrisp: living flame gamers best tho
[9:01:37] tsetse2fly: @The_Crane I'm not 100% sure. But I think the bosses give the 3k xp when you kill them still. That's not influenced by people in your raid. The trash xp gonna be real bad or non-existent
[9:01:39] Baratanis: comparing classic wrath raid loggers to SoD multi alts everywhere tho
[9:01:41] Metaphix: thats a yuuggee server wtf
[9:01:46] voodough: Can u show wrath again
[9:01:52] helixzqt: Hunter is SUPER fun
[9:02:00] helixzqt: Viper aspect so good
[9:02:14] SlapaH03: wrath KEKL
[9:02:15] linkitcraig: that ICC drop
[9:02:32] The_Crane: @tsetse2fly oh OK. I was gonna run it with my lvl 25 friend but didn't wanna nerf his xp
[9:03:20] brushbro: minmaxing gatekeepers
[9:03:24] SardonicHS: people asking logs and gearscore for lvl 25 ubrs
[9:03:29] voodough: ICC is kind of shit tbh I raid every week and not looking forward to it @staysafetv
[9:03:33] parkrangerpeter: @brushbro exactly that
[9:03:35] Railgunnar: the playerbase for SOD seems much better than the player base for retail
[9:03:36] tsetse2fly: @The_Crane Like I said, I'm not 100% sure. You def will tank his xp on trash mobs.
[9:03:53] Vindorin: yes
[9:03:54] sillynix: Yes
[9:03:55] Jpbadger: yes
[9:03:56] mattygisme: yes
[9:03:56] lizcat_: for some people yes
[9:03:58] xBirdisword: SoD is hyperchill lol
[9:04:01] SardonicHS: at least on EU it is
[9:04:05] MilesPro91: sod is so sweaty
[9:04:08] The_Crane: @tsetse2fly ok. I think trash mobs barely give xp in there anyways. It's mostly boss xp i think
[9:04:09] fart_boiii: ^
[9:04:14] parkrangerpeter: Stream pug =/= our pugs
[9:04:16] Kushiize: that raid was def goofy
[9:04:17] fart_boiii: the sweat lords always find me
[9:04:22] Baratanis: pugging as a streamer tho?
[9:04:26] NaManDatAintMe: last boss apparently is pretty hard in gnomer
[9:04:28] OrganikCum: my pugs have been better than his
[9:04:31] fart_boiii: last night they all drunkenly raged
[9:04:31] Surpriize: with sod is there anything to do after gnomergon ?
[9:04:31] Turtlesoc: i mean its treated like it is but it isnt in reality
[9:04:32] Vindorin: LUL
[9:04:32] radassbadass69: SoD is chill af, probably bads being mads because good players only want other good players
[9:04:33] brushbro: viewer pug :aware
[9:04:34] sdykyj1: You checked 9
[9:04:37] fart_boiii: all of wow is sweaty
[9:04:38] liberategeorge: D:
[9:04:48] m0ng0os3: What site was that?
[9:04:48] Synmachus: It was hilarious
[9:04:50] lizcat_: trebolz KEKL
[9:04:57] tsetse2fly: The trebolz icedent
[9:05:00] voodough: EU community the most toxic I ever witnessed
[9:05:00] sdykyj1: You checked out the raid yet?
[9:05:04] Baratanis: LUL
[9:05:04] liberategeorge: D: but the viewer pug was full of love
[9:05:12] themajesticbear: TBH, I'm a regular office worker andy here, yet still easy could pug BFD for weeks on 4 characters. It's a blast
[9:05:13] djleopeo: Good morning Safesex!
[9:05:17] Maxifrog: the average sstv viewer Sadge
[9:05:20] m0ng0os3: I think im playing on a eu server and didn't even realize it
[9:05:23] The_Crane: I've never seen a pug grp that bad. Even the first couple weeks when no one knew mechanics or had gear
[9:05:24] m0ng0os3: what site was that?
[9:05:29] parkrangerpeter: Haha very well, i've had a different experience personally
[9:05:40] fart_boiii: lol theres a ton of sweaty sod players and they arent good either
[9:05:51] tsetse2fly: @m0ng0os3 ironforge dot pro
[9:05:54] parkrangerpeter: I just see a lot of "lul anything but epic/orange parse you are dogshit" from the playerbase
[9:06:04] Metaphix: thats what i plan to do in p2
[9:06:07] dydos09: yo what is the beste specc for raid?
[9:06:13] dydos09: best*
[9:06:17] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I feel it similar to Incel logic like they make an excuse why they can’t do it and then never try
[9:06:21] sdykyj1: sdykyj1 subscribed with Prime. 
[9:06:41] NaManDatAintMe: they are an inventor
[9:06:54] liberategeorge: it's real to me goddammit BabyRage
[9:06:57] brushbro: I admit, I made it up
[9:07:01] itsallabouTRIP: i only pug on 3 chars and it always okay but i did my own groups
[9:07:08] Maxifrog: More likely to find that in wrath right now
[9:07:17] parkrangerpeter: I swear to god bro im not crazy i will tell you real quick
[9:07:20] Maxifrog: maybe you're mixing them up @parkrangerpeter
[9:07:23] smander: my exp is just toxic griefing players so the usual wow exp
[9:07:33] Stevenseagullol: i just make my own pugs in sod, you dont even have to do much, dont need sr links, disc or anything its pretty straight forward a 2-3 weeks into the phase.
[9:07:46] sdykyj1: Seeing you solo dungeons made me reroll lock
[9:07:51] bigdam2024: @smander sounds like you might be the problem if thats all you experience
[9:07:53] SardonicHS: on wotlk i average 98 logs but leveling a new character means i get shut down by some 56 average andy
[9:07:55] lizcat_: level 25 logs lmao
[9:07:57] maddie_1994: I'm a grey parser :)
[9:08:01] Metaphix: your boomies first raid was with ur guild or?
[9:08:03] fart_boiii: i just ball no matter how many losers are around me, got to
[9:08:03] YourHomieAJ: Whats the recommended Level for RFD in your opinion?
[9:08:11] sdykyj1: Will do
[9:08:20] NaManDatAintMe: rfd is 40
[9:08:28] YourHomieAJ: nah Razorfen Down
[9:08:31] einself111: just buy shadow wrath gear from AH and you can easily solo

[9:08:52] fart_boiii: ur cool the
[9:08:55] Nyyx: hey staysafe hows it going? looking forward to start leveling my lock

[9:09:02] OrganikCum: join a shitty pug, they happen all the time
[9:09:07] johnnypoison69: stepping stone
[9:09:11] parkrangerpeter: I've had people whisper me after talking in ashenvale general PvP to shit on my logs (blue)
[9:09:13] Metaphix: monkey branch the guilds
[9:09:13] sigilfish: just dont be bad
[9:09:15] smander: @bigdam2024 so rogues camping runes/quests - higher level hunting parties in quest zones - casters standing on roofs griefing quest hubs... etc etc haven't happened in SoD?
[9:09:23] maddie_1994: Just be proud of your bad logs
[9:09:24] clipt1c: also go on your class discord and ask for advice
[9:09:32] fart_boiii: “just dont be bad” - bad players
[9:09:37] yellow657: kill times improve your parses. some of the best players can parse green cuz simple stuff
[9:09:49] Daddycool_B: Yo staysafe, did you clean Gnom yet ?

[9:11:48] Vicente_Prime: Are you juicing SOD p2?
[9:11:59] baade123: should a lvl 30 do blood moon event? or is it not worth
[9:12:01] Cootiin: hopefully they dont nerf spriest much, just take away our vamp embrace healing
[9:12:05] Vicente_Prime: today?

[12:46:14] Imabelgianwaffle: DICKS
[12:46:15] Reaperview: @Kanhelx tbf lowbies are opting in to a level 40 event
[12:46:24] SlapaH03: around the arena
[12:46:51] Kanhelx: @Reaperview its not a lv 40 event by design, its a stv event which is like 32+
[12:47:22] rinnnyy: cause your groups good LUL
[12:47:32] Etny2k: Pepega stacks!
[12:47:36] ahtee9: epic BatChest
[12:47:42] Kanhelx: how do you urn in the blood loa?
[12:47:47] Karatekappan: NO WAY BatChest
[12:47:56] exnihilo777: this makes me want to play wow again
[12:48:20] TheDastardlyD: so much fucking better than ashenvale
[12:48:24] TheDastardlyD: like not even close
[12:48:32] obstata: what is the negative effect of being in raid? is it a debuff or something
[12:48:55] Foxdonuts: Looks like shadowburn would be amazing here
[12:48:59] theboosh7: ya this is tempting to relog sod honestly
[12:49:03] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @obstata reduces stats and you dont get any blood for kills.
[12:49:18] Kaburst: @Foxdonuts yeeah destro shadowburn conflag
[12:49:23] blindingcoot: has lag been an issue with the pvp stuff yet?
[12:49:25] Bubavondudley: what does the blood do?
[12:49:28] Kanhelx: SO what do u do with the blood loa stacks u get
[12:49:35] Foxdonuts: @Foxdonuts the return of drakedog!
[12:49:44] donkeebrainz: just take 2 or 3 priests in a 5 man group EZ
[12:50:09] Peoplewhinetoomuch: you can also turn them in for honor right
[12:50:09] jupiterzug: getting raptor or kitty first
[12:50:29] markja629: if they put this in retail it would have been time gated so hard
[12:50:32] uggabooga1: show character screen? curious how much gear you still have from 25 raid
[12:50:45] Parson94: yo, how is warlock at 40pvp?
[12:50:49] Randomguy_360: @StaysafeTV Have you played with Dance of the Wicked in pve as a meta yet? it's actually incredible
[12:51:51] xfonzoo: kek
[12:51:57] c0rry5: @StaysafeTV would your current WoW character be able to take batman on in a 1v1?
[12:52:11] ttsoup: no way, I watched you all night,  seelp for 8 hours, and woke up you're still streaming!
[12:52:12] Randomguy_360: with improved imp it's infinite mana and 40% dodge if you use demonic grace with it
[12:52:31] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @Randomguy_360 sounds balanced Kappa
[12:52:51] azrielskyblade9341: what is up staysafe
[12:52:59] Aurkus: i think there needs to b a penalty for attacking ppl with the bloodless debuff
[12:53:00] Randomguy_360: unfortunately when demonic grace ends, you can overwrite the big dodge with another crit for a smaller amount of dodge
[12:53:31] Randomguy_360: but yeah melee will have 0 chance against it
[12:53:44] Randomguy_360: you just become a rogue
[12:53:59] jupiterzug: so what's the "punishment" for being in a group of more than 5?
[12:54:18] TheDastardlyD: will of the forsaken is goated
[12:54:21] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @jupiterzug you get no blood and for every kill stats are reduced by 5%

[12:54:37] rampantgrowth42: ? cmonBruh

[12:54:38] caffox: are we race shaming now?
[12:54:39] reavethederp: I'd be a gnome hunter if icould
[12:54:43] Randomguy_360: yeah but then you're playing a gnome
[12:54:50] c0rry5: its all fun and games when you're a gnome.. until you need something on the top shelf Kappa
[12:55:03] jupiterzug: @jupiterzug oh wow, yeah that's definitely discouraging lol
[12:55:06] Crisis891: warlock doesn’t have mobility anyways and fear. it’s not like they need it. mages do
[12:55:12] EternalFun2023: great stream and all, but now imagine that this lvl 40 content is here for the next like 6 month
[12:55:21] razka: so does killing players in stv also grant honour ?
[12:55:26] azrielskyblade9341: blood elves are the best enchanters tho
