[1:37:51] cptrogers123: Ohh fuck yes man!! :D
[1:37:52] Sollice: You dont need to own SL to play Classic or TBC you just have to have a sub
[1:38:00] DrakhanGaming: just do your callings everyday on as many alts as possible and then u can probably afford tokens
[1:38:03] Jokervenom1978: Wow peeps seems REALLY confused about BC Classic.

[1:38:47] 91Niki: @Fille1809 The 35 bucks is ONLY if you want to have your toon on both the TBC server, and the newly made classic vanilla server. If you just wanna play either or, it's free :D
[1:38:47] FranciscoTheMage: can you compare the preach intvw to sloots? which was better more informative @Towelliee
[1:38:49] Jokervenom1978: @Kinghorn i agree
[1:38:50] Nico_vdM: This dungeon has a lot of portals in the first half

[1:39:31] majestictaco0: dungeon journal for order?
[1:39:32] Siglius: Doesn't help that Asmongold had a thumbnail going like "35 bucks to play BC. Did Blizz kill BC already" LUL

[1:44:12] NovaSun84: This is his main YT channel croco_chan not a clone or a knock off
[1:44:14] jure__: asmons youtube channel is just cat danny and asertonsin doing their thing and giving a few bucks to Asmon, he doesnt give a fuck
[1:44:15] PadidinJones: This place looks so dope

[3:07:12] Curtsy: I enjoy that sometimes stuff in mmorpgs is just there to be there
[3:07:13] Secondbreakfasttt: 3 new things in 9,1; new zone Korthia almost the same with aredvield, new Mega dg literally contains legion and bfa zones and raid already in torghast lmao. now wonder 9,1 comes too late
[3:07:16] Daggerstry: They want you dead
[3:08:07] DeanoTV: what else do u want KEKW

[3:08:44] temp3st98: Where is this place located?
[3:08:46] erdls: yh i ll miss how castle natria looked
[3:08:51] BubbaChubbs420: too much
[3:08:51] Darkpallyy: towRee towRee
[3:08:51] fat_european0: I think the 9.1 content is quite a bit, it's just taken too long. I also assume 9.2 will be delayed as well which makes the problem worse
[3:08:57] Sollice: I feel like, and I am hoping, SL is an expansion setting up the hugeness of 10.0
[3:09:12] Sevcikova: its really rather plain
[3:09:17] Sollice: You have the brokers, who can travel between realms and space. Hopefully they stick around we have to use them to get around the cosmos
[3:09:24] archer2342: Well with it taking so long you bet the focus will be TBC content pushing retail to not drown itself
[3:09:26] DeanoTV: 9.2 hopefully before xmas
[3:09:29] Mecabeast: it'd be a different opinion if torghast released in 9.1 instead of 9.2
[3:09:31] aberlourspey: Return to kara and Mechagon both reused assets as well. If we want everything to look unique, we're only going to be making patches even longer.
[3:09:35] Mecabeast: sorry 9.0
[3:09:41] Sollice: @Towelliee Your right no more hype. We as gamers do that too much
[3:09:44] GFiTV: @Towelliee if you had to rate this dungeon from first impression, Where would you rate it compared to all other dungeons in wow? A tier? S tier? F tier? <3
[3:09:45] fat_european0: comparing 9.1 to other x.1 patches it's good imo but the delays are just too much FeelsBadMan
[3:09:46] NierrEdits: pso2 is pretty good
[3:09:47] Darthyrevan: Mass Effect on Friday <3
[3:09:47] remixonfire91: yes but a mmo version
[3:09:51] pepedeeee: Neopets
[3:09:54] TheTazzyBoy: congrats
[3:09:58] manavomit: You can play it for free, not sure why youd need a beta unless im missing something?
[3:09:58] Ezekyler: AYAYA
[3:10:12] Sarocus: OG Phantasy Star was so good. Remmeber mapping that entire thing out
[3:10:14] TheTazzyBoy: its for their new game, it looks pretty good
[3:10:17] CyonDru: @willisdoesokay probs the new genesis beta
[3:10:21] Jokervenom1978: The new update to PSO2 is supposed to be a major revamp of the game
[3:10:34] erdls: agreed
[3:10:34] Moondagger98: I loved the mechagon dungeon when it came out
[3:10:37] manavomit: @Jaybruvx So is that an expansion, or something like that?
[3:10:39] Broomba: @towelliee do u think SL and Blizzards ideas on how they conceived the expansion is playing out they way they wanted or where it should be executed?
[3:10:39] Moondagger98: Hated the island though
[3:10:40] Ezekyler: compare and rate all the dungeons in the game @Towelliee Kappa
[3:10:45] Poarn: @Towelliee PSO2 is the dreamcast game on steroids, very OG RPG
[3:10:49] PvtHudson093: Mechagon had those hard modes
[3:10:57] CyonDru: @willisdoesokay yeah they are treating it as an expac basically, with a huge combat revamp
[3:11:10] manavomit: @Jaybruvx Oooo awesome, thank you
[3:11:14] Suwah84: dont get why they cant have m+ for the mega dungeon right away lol
[3:11:15] Rakim88: recycled assets
[3:11:15] GFiTV: It did look rly cool. Aint no blackrock depths, but it looks rly cool.
[3:11:16] JackHealMe: its fucking lazy
[3:11:34] fat_european0: they should add a hard mode to the new dungeon which rewards the pirate dragon as a mount if you do it Pog
[3:11:47] Moondagger98: Doesn't make sense that we helped them clear stuff on the island for weeks, just to do the dungeon and suddenly there's more things to clear.
[3:11:50] CyonDru: @JackHealMe i think thats a bit extreme

[3:12:05] pepedeeee: Figure out what dungeon it is by figuring out what dungeon its not
[3:12:12] ceranac23: it will have
[3:12:17] Curtsy: I'm spoiled in WoW, I played Anarchy Online for 15 years where all dungeons are either saves or industrial looking areas LUL
[3:12:22] Curtsy: caves*
[3:12:25] Kinghorn: the last 2 have had something I am sure this will
[3:12:27] Sollice: Jesus
[3:12:33] Sollice: 15 years of Anarchy Online. Your a trooper
[3:12:41] GFiTV: Every mega dungeon released since classic has been pretty good though :) name me a BAD mechadungeon? Gnomergan, if that evne counts as one?
[3:12:46] Curtsy: @Sollice It hasn't been easy
[3:12:51] JackHealMe: @Jaybruvx how? they're reusing assets they've already designed so they don't need to make new ones. It's lazy but it also means they don't have to spend as much money creating new ones
[3:12:57] Broomba: what score would u give phantasy star online (org)? @towelliee
[3:12:59] MetaKuron: Hard mode is going to be to actually enter the thing through customs :p
[3:13:00] Curtsy: Playing a game that technically died on day 1 has been rough LUL
[3:13:06] Ezekyler: yesterday the question was about Mythic only phase for Sylivie, but i think no one asked about hard modes in megadungeons
[3:13:52] fat_european0: damn korthia looks tiny af
[3:14:00] The13Legion: you can preview the mount also the vendor have
[3:14:10] DeanoTV: @Towelliee u think 9.2 before xmas?

[3:14:41] Sollice: @Jaybruvx The other thing you have to consider at this point is they may be so behind they have to reuse assets to get caught back up. And I dont know when, and if it's another group of people, but I am sure work has already begun on the next expansion

[3:17:27] rohdey: @NoWaayMan no way man, new rep for venari in 9.1
[3:17:28] Bombayshow: Kinda funny that china can use bnet but not twitter facebook or youtube LUL
[3:17:28] theszoti: they also said no mini-raid planned for this xpac
[3:17:33] banana93: @mikeywarlock Thank you! Just missed it then. Was it the whole dungeon that was available?
[3:17:47] Crossoutdnb: pardon my ignorance. i stopped playin at legion. 2 play new classes, need to do the achivements both factions and a lvl60?
[3:17:56] Mecabeast: mini raids were for when it makes sense story wise
[3:18:00] NoWaayMan: @rohdey woord thanks buddy

[3:31:09] maccaruso: I miss those days as well.  Why bother with treasure chests anymore
[3:31:12] NovaPrime92: Draenor gave you swords and gear and shit
[3:31:19] Stars_Eternall: i miss the panda chests

[3:31:46] gooseboy429: xp
[3:31:50] wildfire9020: when's flying gonna happen?
[3:32:06] Broomba: WoD was christmas with those chests

[3:32:10] j_bar111: Has anyone tried lvling with torgast?
[3:32:47] j_bar111: oh
[3:32:59] robbo1010: sloot did incredibly well
[3:32:59] Sollice: Not planned for 9.1 either but maybe down the line
[3:33:02] CCG_337: lol, wod did nothing wrong well except the server stability
[3:33:06] Kale_Nd: is there a video of the interview anywhere ?
[3:33:06] lumaday: so good
[3:33:25] lumaday: got us some actual insight
[3:33:34] alanomeara: yeah he needed more time
[3:33:48] luckfore: 1 hour is to short for those interviews
[3:33:49] pixxelina: Ion interview wasnt good
[3:33:53] fat_european0: He was good at interviewing, but I didn't rly like all the answers
[3:33:54] j_bar111: Sylvanas "corpse" Kappa
[3:34:21] S1appadabass: the answer to why the last two bosses dont drop weapons for all classes was...strange
[3:34:31] Curtsy: Sloot seems to be pretty good at this, he speaks at a distant pace and usually seems to pronounces stuff clearly, good for an international audience
[3:34:49] Sollice: Well he was a caster for what MDI? So he has experience in these things
[3:35:44] feferez30: next patch monk BM are good to tank?
[3:35:54] fat_european0: The weapon token answer was cringe af
[3:36:22] Sollice: I dont even remember how it was answered

[3:36:37] Domi98_: some people don't get their 233 weapons cuz they can't kill the boss because they aren't good enough so why should u KEKW
[3:36:41] S1appadabass: I award you zero points, and my god have mercy on your soul
[3:36:42] EthicalHermit: I thought it made sense for what they wanted to achieve with covenants
[3:36:42] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:36:57] Bulgogiprince: Response is basically they wanted to people to get the cosmetic style to start the expac and then with 9.1 they are like this style is similar so we aren't going to do that
[3:36:58] feferez30: next patch monk BM are good to tank?
[3:37:14] Nutsy: do wowhead have a TLDR on sloot interview?
[3:37:15] Dackor: if genuinely believing that you shoiuld remove high ilvl weapons from end bosses is because people feel left out for not being able to do it, then why have higher ilvl gear from more difficult content
[3:37:18] fat_european0: I hope they take that last bit of feedback from Sloot seriously and act on it tbh. It'd be so nice to just hear their thought process and know they heard feedback, even if they disagree with it
[3:37:24] littlehelle: i going 1-60 even possible in 2 weeks in classic
[3:37:24] feferez30: ty
[3:37:25] Sollice: https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/9878-Patch-9-1-Sloot-Interview-With-Morgan-Day
[3:37:51] Nutsy: @Sollice Thank you PogChamp
[3:38:05] adampanerabread: the trained flayedwing is in the middle area
[3:38:05] ayyclay: @littlehelle if you no life it, its like 3 days of played time or so with the nerfs
[3:38:09] Sollice: wowhead does have a summary as well I was just happnign to look at MMO champion
[3:38:09] CCG_337: I really dislike this gloomy areas, queldanas better colors lol
[3:38:31] odin326: is the new dungeon playable on ptr?
[3:38:31] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:38:37] Tac2cul2: set up transend and jump off :D
[3:38:42] littlehelle: @ayyclay like 72 hours then?
[3:39:26] Sollice: Again I think a monthly or even every other month they should go back to a QA session. I think the developers and community don't have the greatest relationship so QAs always help that
[3:39:44] Ghettoskippy: Hearing and listening are two different things though. They may hear our issues but I dont think they necessarily listen as often as theyre being credited for.
[3:39:46] WhiteKnight74648: o/
[3:40:03] alanomeara: no you blow me lol
[3:40:03] lumaday: Was the dev watercooler thing with Holinka?
[3:40:42] Sollice: @Ghettoskippy Depending on the issue though it may not always be easy to implement things. Development normally has a pretty strict schedule and content. So if you have a great idea they would like to implement it may take a patch or two to get it in depending on the complexity
[3:41:07] NelsonGamingShow: I think dev answer: we don't do water coolers we are devs not content creators kekw
[3:41:24] fat_european0: Doesn't need to be for everything
[3:41:24] Curtsy: Some game companies literally never speak to you about issues for 20 years
[3:42:18] frogbound: Imagine bitching to nintedo because mario can glitch in Mario Bros 3 KEKW
[3:42:20] Sollice: @NelsonGamingShow The process is not hard. CMs gather a huge group of questions to submit to devs. Dev s read and decide which they want to talk about. They find a designee on the team to go and answer those questions

[3:42:30] Nevrbloom_: LUL
[3:42:42] captivate7: lmao
[3:42:45] EthicalHermit: I mean, thats still feed back from both parties :)
[3:42:55] fat_european0: sucks that we can't fly in Korthia
[3:42:56] Nevrbloom_: yeah doesnt look that great :>
[3:43:05] Mecabeast: I'd like to hear more about what devs are currently enjoying on live
[3:43:27] PvtHudson093: do you think Mechagon or Najatar were better zones than Korthia
[3:44:07] tripl3heart: In my opinion people are taking it all waaaay to serious and to a personal level. In one way or another there are issues, they know, we know, let's not get too toxic about it...
[3:44:18] CMack_72: Being shit on, on the Internet.  That doesn't seem plausible.
[3:44:19] NovaPrime92: Yeah but that's due to years and years of the same continuous blunders though
[3:44:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: people gonna bitch no matter what
[3:44:26] KingSlayerYotam: seems like it was real tbh

[3:44:47] madhatterui: what happened?
[3:44:48] Sollice: @Towelliee It's a fine line. If they stop talking all together than the community goes ape shit about not hearing anything. Game Devs are in the worst spot. It's basically managing which kind of shit they want to eat. Long firm ones, or loose wet ones
[3:45:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats a bigass rug they sweeped this under
[3:45:06] formation2252: Is there a renown vendor on the PTR

[3:47:25] NovaPrime92: I bet you he didn't say anything because it's not making the rounds at major outlets
[3:47:26] sagethemage40: That’s an assumption
[3:47:37] sagethemage40: Definitely said it about the three

[3:50:03] Armageddon213: weird flex but ok
[3:50:09] Glozki: meanwhile i live in a monoply and have 6 down and 2 up...
[3:50:16] Curtsy: I just wanted the ME3 multiplayer to have a renewed playerbase, and they don't include it in the remaster PepeHands
[3:50:17] Chiraakitteh: Now just 25Mb BibleThump
[3:50:27] Skaboy_TV: Downloaded Warzone... Why would you do that to yourself!?
[3:50:28] Broomba: you are streaming and running wow eating up download and upload
[3:50:29] Kinghorn: monkaS

[3:51:18] Curtsy: @fat_european0 One dlc is missing because of source code issues, and ME3 multiplayer is not included
[3:51:18] NovaPrime92: @fat_european0 They did a lot of ME1 and did a lot of retexturing with 4k textures and a ton of different stuff. I'd say its a little more than just a remaster

[3:51:46] NovaPrime92: They made ME1 combat feel exactly like ME3
[3:52:07] Curtsy: They took a lot of ideas from mods, I think they even mention that as inspiration, maybe they even directly spoke to some
[3:52:08] cabalish: u can play it in exactly 2 days
[3:52:16] PokerFaceMoose: me1 had the worst combat
[3:52:19] Chiraakitteh: They added headshot damage to me1, made the Mako drivable haha
[3:52:20] Crow_Bot: Did they remaster the ending to ME3?  Kappa

[3:54:49] Holymoomo: hey guys, i have a question, will there be a free boost for people going TBC ? or is it only possible through paid services ?
[3:54:53] dimofodi: They didn't want me to help test them during the BETA, I don't want to help them stress it now. @Towelliee :D

[3:55:51] DragonofWolves: I learned from SL beta not to overplay on any beta, got burnt out on shadowlands for an entire couple months
[3:56:16] DrakhanGaming: why do they make it sound like some battle pass with a bunch of rewards when its literally just a character boost
[3:56:29] Holymoomo: @91Niki was asking because before all that paid services drama, there was going to be a free boost for people wanting to play with there friends

[4:10:45] 3663Sharad: Diehard fans will prolly wait for new servers tbh
[4:10:51] 2naDlisch: Should just turn classic into seasons like diablo, fresh launch
[4:10:54] CritcobainTV: ^
[4:11:02] DragonofWolves: i mean all the quests are gonna be the same anyway, all the old lore quests are gonna be in still anyway, they got rid of all the old lore quests in cata
[4:11:02] CritcobainTV: i don't see the point of playing end game forever lol
[4:11:22] CritcobainTV: you would just roll new toons at that point
[4:11:23] madhatterui: fresh? are they doing restarts?
[4:11:26] Rugmanimus: 35$ is nothing imo
[4:11:31] MuttonChopins: its just better to just level in classic, thats the fun part of it

[4:13:06] elexi30: towTrain towTrain
[4:13:09] alejandrogonor: Where is the location of the new dungeon?
[4:13:09] Shugaze: but people would drop classic anyways 35$ or not.. its TBC!
[4:13:09] Daggerstry: Dodged
[4:13:10] mavericks312: and they will do the same come wrath to get ppl to play wrath classic
[4:13:12] Hyelander_: The first suggestion devs had was to take your residence as collateral for character transfer, then someone suggested $35
[4:13:12] Eviltuna13: My thoughts on the price is to maybe stop people going to the classic server so they don’t have to maintain them
[4:13:15] maccaruso: towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil
[4:13:16] Anomoly: I think the price is just a deterrent so people pick one - Makes it easier on them down the line when classic server merges come into play
[4:13:16] z01z: its not the price, its the value.  i mean, towelie just copied a character to ptr in seconds, it costs them nothing
[4:13:16] critin87: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[4:13:18] NovaSun84: I play Classic to beat it.  My endgame raid characters are my reason for Classic.

[4:13:30] MuttonChopins: if towelliee thinks its too much, its too much
[4:13:35] sloppydood: How much was TBC originally on launch? 40?
[4:13:37] A_New_Challenger: towGift towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:13:38] DrakhanGaming: I feel like a lot of people might clone their TBC characters when wrath comes out though
[4:13:45] coldhandsbeatz: For a game for which you pay monthly EVERYTHING should he cheap. All their serviced are expensive af
[4:13:48] binlizzle: SeemsGood
[4:13:50] pbnj_kills: blizz lets you copy onto ptr for free for an unlimited amount and which shows the $35 price is too much
[4:14:02] dcmeier9: think the 9.1 rumor is true?
[4:14:04] McThiq: I was the new player last week, maxed leveling out on Warlords of Draenor so I had to switch expansions to get to 60 but the grind doesn’t stop!
[4:14:07] dcmeier9: srry if u already said it
[4:14:16] Mecabeast: private server players angry at the copy price kekw

[4:14:30] Bombayshow: people buying characters boost for 80 bucks for sure they dont care and know people will spend their money
[4:14:37] Motivess: yea, the 35 isn't for classic to BC, it's getting people ready for BC to wrath @towelliee
[4:14:45] sagethemage40: This dungi looks so nice
[4:14:51] remixonfire91: they just milking classic players , i dont play classic but i can see it sucking for the classic community
[4:14:51] Crow_Bot: MEGA-SERVER!
[4:15:06] johnnboitoi: I just really hope they don't stop classic with Wrath. I'd KILL for a cata and MoP classic...
[4:15:10] NovaPrime92: i really hope they stop classic at like WOTLK
[4:15:24] DrakhanGaming: They should just have 3 servers for classic when tbc comes out, RP, PVP AND PVE
[4:15:26] Garrujak: I REALLY can't wait for all the private server schlepps to go back. Leave Blizz servers to people who aren't toxic AF when you don't play "optimally"
[4:15:27] Zubberikan: I know they won't do it, but I would LOVE a MoP server
[4:15:28] Moondagger98: itll stop at wrath
[4:15:31] Crow_Bot: Cata Classic, where everyone stops one month into the xpac Kappa
[4:15:33] Haazer: hard to love homie
[4:15:35] Haazer: kek

[4:15:47] Fysics101: Classic did so well,..they were definitely going to try to monetize it. Shame.
[4:15:56] DrakhanGaming: I feel like cata is the last "classic" they can come out with

[4:16:49] coldhandsbeatz: I think they should have seasonal servers but with expansions and accelerated content. Like 6months or 1 year of classic, then BC, then WotLK, then back to classic. Having every classic expansion at a time and potentially fresh ones will be impossible to manage and every realm will have low population

[4:20:52] Kebabra_: Thanks
[4:20:57] dcmeier9: i wonder what the new ilvl cap is
[4:21:01] NovaSun84: So mythic raiding in this tier will require 233 or higher avg level?
[4:21:11] Crow_Bot: so does this place have gear with special effects, or is it the usual +100 Haste +69 crit?

[4:24:19] astonishhhh: You leveling prot or ret?
[4:24:22] SonofHorus82: I'm hoping that too. I have the 19th and 20th off due to my second vaccine on the 19th so hopefully it doesnt hit me to hard and I can play.
[4:24:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want to be at least 15 but 20 is the goal on pre patch day and without taking off work
[4:24:39] Kinghorn: yeah I was expecting it to be 50 or 60 Moondagger98 the real shock was the clone price

[4:37:48] Mecabeast: I wonder how the dungeon feels if your group is all 184
[4:38:00] Sandman_88: longer time to kill, longer time to spend in-game
[4:38:06] Skylin3r: this looks pretty good so far
[4:38:27] DrakhanGaming: if only this dungeon was more rewarding for people who dont need to catch up

[4:38:51] ValorisGaming: Is this the mega dungeon
[4:39:00] jaysteea: yep
[4:39:11] fistofnature: @DrakhanGaming there will probably be achivements/mounts and a hardmode
[4:39:11] VinceAyne: Are they dumping Prideful in 9.1?

[4:41:55] Sollice: Possible powers you may get from the Jailer
[4:42:00] TDorno: neither does blizz :D
[4:42:05] Sollice: Jailers Eye I mean

[4:42:26] phiil__: I'm so glad you grew your hair back
[4:42:38] Sollice: What's the difference between anima powers in M+ and Corruption?

[4:43:02] Sollice: Oh because it'srandom? Yeah that will be "fun"
[4:43:05] Jay_rb: Allstar points probably won't matter on the first boss
[4:43:07] xluckydawgx: "I didnt get my BIS AP, Restart the fucking key!!!"
[4:43:21] majestictaco0: if they're anything like Torghast now, complete runs at really high key levels can be trashed because you don't get the super busted power. So really hope it's not like that

[4:43:36] akia03: the 45% hp anima power would be nice in m+ or raid
[4:43:47] SirYacob: I seriously doubt it's random anima powers...
[4:44:02] dergNwolf: I hope they let us test it soon so there's still time to maybe fix it
[4:44:17] Broomba: @Olivermikael from Grizzly Hills
[4:44:25] stresstest: hard to do Time Race Tournement if Powers are random and most likely will dictate the speed you can clear the key
[4:44:25] dergNwolf: if you don't interrupt it's a dot on the entire group
[4:44:30] Valestrus: @Towelliee PTR question = Don't you think that PTR testing should be done internally and not allowed to be streamed? Allowing a large pool of people to play it and stream it, makes the content easier to clear when it comes out no?

[5:24:29] DeanoTV: no way
[5:24:33] Sollice: Well Biden has said he would like to be at 70% by July 4th. That may be a bit too optomistic though

[5:24:52] captivate7: tickets would of gone on sale by now
[5:24:52] manmower: CA definitely had the best leadership during covid
[5:24:57] Revelations45: who the hell knows
[5:25:02] Eraste: lol ya, blizzcon this year they just talk about the upcoming patch 9.1 ResidentSleeper
[5:25:02] rhodeos_: tickets would of been sold out by now*
[5:25:03] gandalfsbeard24: Copper*
[5:25:07] Revelations45: @manmower no sir lol
[5:25:13] the_Jiffah: do they?
[5:25:21] amwood: California and best leadership should never be in the same sentence lol.
[5:25:25] PandaTV: idk if i'd go this year if there was one tbh wayyyy to risky
[5:25:27] rhodeos_: they should do an in-game blizcon
[5:25:30] Sollice: MOve it to a smaller venue

[5:25:40] 91Niki: @PandaTV towHi
[5:25:40] MrKhanes: They could do a digital one in November.
[5:25:47] Its_Immanis: i could see them doing another digital one at the start of 2022 and announcing a physical one for later in the year at the end of the digital one
[5:25:49] sirledros: what is there to even talk about at Blizzcon
[5:25:54] DeanoTV: people are so fucking stupid if they go abroad this year
[5:25:55] Camtully: E3 next month. :)
[5:25:57] Broomba: is the risk worth it
[5:26:01] Revelations45: I would go no problem
[5:26:08] kashmara: only let in the vaccinated. then I'd go

[5:26:15] ABeardedVet: vacinnated doesnt mean you're immuned
[5:26:19] Sollice: I would consider going. I can tell you one thing though. It's going to be a while before I would want to step on a cruise ship again
[5:26:20] Kelticlore: just cause your vacinated doesnt mean you still cant spread it
[5:26:21] honeychonker: International travel will still be in chaos for a long time too, we have a "traffic light system" for countries but it could change at short notice
[5:26:24] chrslp: People ALWAYS get sick at Blizzcon LUL
[5:26:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: im using my vacation time for TBC release so its a no go for me KEKW
[5:26:28] Garrujak: If I went I'd double mask. Neckbeards carry worse diseases than COVID
[5:26:31] OnceAMoose: Alcohol kills covid
[5:26:32] Measai: but it makes no sense for a blizzcon, they have nothing in hands
[5:26:34] doomdrake13: wait - there's a new dungeon coming??
[5:26:35] OnceAMoose: right?
[5:26:36] DrakhanGaming: yeah isnt the vaccine only a 96% chance of not gettin covid

[5:27:02] mmrghost7: covid kills alchoholic
[5:27:03] Revelations45: Everclear killed his own music carrier
[5:27:05] DelcoAF: including potential children
[5:27:06] OnceAMoose: Jungle Juice it is
[5:27:11] thrakan84: @DrakhanGaming no it just stops you from getting sick enough that you have to go to the hospital
[5:27:13] alanomeara: only role is you must love everything the dev's have ever done
[5:27:15] Revelations45: career
[5:27:16] duncon: Everclear was a fun concert to see
[5:27:22] Algfader: No.. broccoli kills cancer so probably covid. Carlin says so.
[5:27:24] alanomeara: rule*
[5:27:27] Khyber_GT: so glad no rules here. just live life normal. except for gas shortage right now. panic freaking out morons over nothing
[5:27:28] Sollice: @DrakhanGaming This is the correct answer
[5:27:31] kokochris: @duncon now we going back in time
[5:27:36] sperg0verlord: my uncle is a vegetable because of everclear
[5:27:37] S1appadabass: thats higher than the flu shot
[5:27:38] Sollice: err no
[5:27:38] Shrapnel_1974: Good morning fellas
[5:27:39] Roaringkittylol: Imagine thinking a Vaccine kills covid instead of Cambells chicken noodle soup, dayquill and sprite. South Park is never wrong.
[5:27:47] uglla3np: famous last words
[5:27:48] ruivobalistico: If you have 96% chance of not getting the virus and i you follow rules, u aint gettin it for sure
[5:27:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: better than a 0% chance to not get it
[5:27:54] Garrujak: We're talking Blizz fans towelliee, you'll be lucky if they shower
[5:27:56] Armageddon213: Of not feeling the effects not being immune
[5:27:57] sperg0verlord: how long is the vaccine good for
[5:27:59] duncon: @kokochris yea that was about 20 years ago :D
[5:28:00] Aethn: Heck Flu vaccine is only 60-70% each year at best
[5:28:02] bhxkazzam1: its like a condom, 96% protection, would you stop sex

[5:28:08] thrakan84: The vaccine only stops you from getting seriously sick
[5:28:10] Sollice: @thrakan84 Answer was correct. The vaccine DOES NOT make you immune. It builds your antibodies so you do not get it as bad
[5:28:20] itishaax: LUL that is true haha
[5:28:21] Sollice: This is not a cure it's a vaccine
[5:28:22] Shrapnel_1974: ROFL
[5:28:24] manmower: if you want vaccine information I would go to an official source like the CDC
[5:28:24] kokochris: @duncon good times :P
[5:28:33] honeychonker: @Aethn That;s because they are always playing catch up, the flu shot is technically warding against the previous season's flu, or the southern hemisphere's one
[5:28:37] Eraste: stop calling it a vaccine NotLikeThis
[5:28:37] heltvild9001: I'm not vaccinated and I'd go anyway lol
[5:28:43] Instigaetor653: no shit. look at Asmongold. he showers like a once a quarter.

[5:28:52] Holy_Z: CDC LUL
[5:28:53] Rakim88: 96% is really high if 75% of population has it
[5:28:55] DrakhanGaming: people got sha mount after 1 kill, 96% isnt good enough
[5:28:56] thrakan84: there is now some data saying that it does help stop transmission but the vaccines were not made for that purpose
[5:28:57] Revelations45: Hammer Masks with Stay 6 Fucking Feet Away from me
[5:29:01] Sollice: @Aethn 100% correct. The build seasonaol flu off the other hemiispheres data

[5:29:28] Kelticlore: thought iut was
[5:29:28] Roaringkittylol: @HaxzorJimDuggan thats nasty, poor man.
[5:29:47] Aethn: CDC has dugf itself a hole, they are dno longer trustworthy with all the false info they hagve been shilling out for the last few months
[5:29:50] DecayedmiNt: @veox89 There's over 2000 variants of the flu and it only keeps going. By the time you get vaccinated for one, another variant shows up
[5:29:51] captivate7: what time is the launch test? 11 pst?
[5:29:54] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I dunno, have you seen people in LFR @Towelliee They have difficulty social distancing in regards to mechanics
[5:30:06] PandaTV: i dont think they could get its way to up and down stats wise for corona still to confirm yet
[5:30:06] Sollice: I think their release schedules wont line up very well with a Nov Blizzcon
[5:30:08] HaloS23: @Towelliee can we be real for a minute and admit we rrun a higher chance of death just driving day to day! Im over this BS!!!

[5:30:29] Holy_Z: announce next expansion
[5:30:34] Roaringkittylol: GROSS
[5:30:35] Sollice: 10.0 MAYBE? DI will be out by then. D2 will have probably just released because of holiday. No D4 or OW2 major announcements
[5:30:37] rhodeos_: 9.1.5 delayed bc devs are playing new world
[5:30:44] duncon: well that will be 0% of games i play
[5:30:47] ABeardedVet: Didnt we basically have blizzcon yesterday in Sloots stream with the Dev?  Not really much more info they are going to give

[5:31:20] Sandman_88: gross
[5:31:21] Holy_Z: Shadowlands only getting a 9.2, wod all over
[5:31:21] Sollice: I think the WORST thing they can do is have a shitty LIVE Blizzcon. That would be terrible for them right now
[5:31:23] Sielu11628: Who is even working on 10.0
[5:31:28] Boccardo316: May 20th map reveal for OW2

[5:32:33] Garrujak: God, I can't believe we all expected Legion 2.0 and instead got WoD 2.0
[5:32:34] Sollice: No one hopes 10.0 is an underwater expansion except for you lol
[5:32:35] Lumik_Stream: talking about shadowlands ?

[5:33:22] nihilist74: aquaman expansion
[5:33:25] TheRiwen: I am just waiting for 10.0

[5:34:43] PandaTV: I want us to Lose shadowlands and thats where it ends
[5:34:51] Buckwink: id be fine with that if 10.0 is lit like Legion was
[5:34:58] Squidnapped: @PandaTV You wanna say bye bye, huh?
[5:35:05] nihil_draegon: True
[5:35:08] Sollice: @PandaTV We should 100% lose for sure. Let the story keep going and make it lead to something larger
[5:35:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: unleash sargeras let him finish the job
[5:35:09] MrKhanes: @PandaTV Agree! Lets loose for once.
[5:35:11] manmower: it would be interesting if the big bad guy won for once and we continued the story
[5:35:15] Chaosruler: Legion story was good too imo
[5:35:20] xluckydawgx: Yeah same, I would be exxtrmely happy if we lose and 10.0 is a very Shadowbringers esque story

[5:36:01] itishaax: fucking TRAINWRECK LUL
[5:36:04] Buckwink: or he leaked that on purpose and she doesn't die
[5:36:07] PokerFaceMoose: quote unquote corpse *shifty eyes*
[5:36:07] 3663Sharad: Now hes dead LUL
[5:36:09] Reddevc: i heard "corpse"
[5:36:09] rhodeos_: isnt she already a corpse anyway?
[5:36:09] mavericks312: that shit was done purposely
[5:36:13] Garrujak: If she doesn't die in SL I won't play 10.0 I'm TIRED of her
[5:36:14] manmower: if people mention sylvanas death the stock plummets
[5:36:14] sinlesssinner: chapter 4 Jaina is a DREADLORD, the unsee guests, go read that shit!
[5:36:14] DishChi: but she was corpse for years

[5:36:24] DrakhanGaming: well shes technically already a corpse
[5:36:32] FerociouzMonk: It’s about time we faced someone we can’t defeat.
[5:36:34] Exxcar: I mean she is the banshee queen, she could leave her body and go back to her ghost form
[5:36:36] StormReaper4Ever: She is a Banshee she can just fly away
[5:36:36] Sollice: I don't think he meant anything by it. We say we "kill bosses" all of the time when we don't. It's just an accepted term for defeating a boss
[5:36:41] PandaTV: I REALLLYYYYY like this idea floating around that the titans, Seat of the Pantheon are the bad guys and we have been helping them the whole time not knowing it
[5:36:45] sinlesssinner: yep, its quite nuts that Malganis is out here now
[5:36:45] Kelticlore: Sylvannas is a Dreadlord
[5:36:50] Celestia6: any sign of Nathanos? I thought we would have seen him in shadowlands after we killed him
[5:36:52] michaelmm: As things stand either they have a 9.3 or decide to release 10.0 in Spring 2023.  That's a decision they will have to make at some point (assuming they haven't already).
[5:36:53] DishChi: when will Azeroth the titan reborn?
[5:37:05] nihil_draegon: I keep hope that Nyalotha will come back in the future but in a zone, like ruins

[5:39:47] Heksanar: And the new expansion is about Illidan crashing from space  into maelstrom like a meteor, and coming out as a new version of Deathwing Kappa
[5:39:51] mavericks312: we are gonna have a dreadlords xpac pretty soon if not next
[5:40:05] Var____: is shadowlands good?
[5:40:09] PokerFaceMoose: i blame the draenei as well
[5:40:10] manmower: Denathrius is the real bad guy of this xpac perhaps
[5:40:25] Sollice: @Towelliee That's why I say Jailer CAN NOT DIE. If Denathrius really has always worked with the Jailer and he is his ally and Jailer told Denathrius to make Dreadlords then the Jailer is the single most important boss we have ever had. To make him a 1 and done boss is dumb

[5:40:45] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Nzoth 2.0 as in one of the biggest bad's gets killed off in less than a patch just hope they get at least a couple expansions out of the jailer....
[5:40:48] shimwood: Can confirm, I'm a dreadlord
[5:40:55] Sollice: That or Denathrius is the single most important boss. Either way one of those two needs to continue to be continued
[5:41:04] Eraste: @Sollice n'zoth getting neck lazered says hello (not saying n'zoth is done tho)

[5:41:44] DragonofWolves: what book is that
[5:41:45] Sollice: @Sollice True, but now its being theorized N'zoth was actually trying to SAVE us from Jailer. Save us in his own way. Better to be his slave than Jailers kind of thing
[5:41:47] mattmasters96: Everyone is a dreadlord
[5:41:51] shiibi4: what is a dratlord
[5:41:54] Garrujak: It's weird how we seem to always dumb down the powers in the lore. Like every major lore figure becomes "some dude's janitor" just for that guy to become a janitor later.
[5:41:56] 3663Sharad: Dreadlord or just a fanatic

[5:42:49] Sollice: Because look at it this way. Jailer may want to destroy ALL creation. N'Zoth and old golds just want everyone to be their slaves. Better to be nothing or slaves I guess
[5:42:49] slothiest: @Towelliee man I really do like the idea of the light being kinda sketch too.

[5:58:09] remixonfire91: On a blog run by Wolfire Games, CEO David Rosen revealed that he is leading a class-action antitrust lawsuit representing game developers against Valve Corporation. He asserted that the near dominance of Steam on the PC games market increases the prices of games due to Valve's service taking a 30% commission from the sale of each game. He also stated that any attempts to diverge from that system would result in a game being “removed from Steam
[5:58:15] itishaax: Ya i thought it was to due with the fact they force devs to sell for the same amount etc.
[5:58:48] kranyoldlady: Indie developer (and Humble Indie Bundle originator) Wolfire Games has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Steam creator Valve, saying that the company is wielding Steam's monopoly power over the PC gaming market to extract "an extraordinarily high cut from nearly every sale that passes through its store—30%
