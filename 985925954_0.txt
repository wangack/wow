[0:46:24] Lexi__Marie: youll see if you get the achievements

[0:47:06] Ambersulfr: :D
[0:47:10] Mallaes: All 4

[0:47:27] geokouts: maybe its account wide
[0:47:36] cruzeal: it isn't i think
[0:47:38] xluckydawgx: @sortsakias13 Its not

[0:48:43] PapaPing1: I was nightfae
[0:48:45] death_cam_: its +35 anima token for every ach you get
[0:48:53] Lincoln_WoW: i had 4k on my map last night after the hotfix
[0:49:06] KaisenSiru: The epic one is unchanged. Only affects Uncommon and Rare anima items
[0:49:06] LycanKain: The epic ones don't change. Only the green/rare ones change.
[0:49:08] death_cam_: so if you done r3 everything its +105 anima from m+, wqs and daily quests
[0:49:14] DownUndaThunda: increases the minor anima tokens, not the world boss
[0:49:15] iamsolitary: +1 anima token for Uncommon and Rare items
[0:49:17] Fortvila: still no 9.1 ptr huh ?
[0:49:21] aeyt: think its only for the ones that give multiples of 35
[0:49:25] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee it doesnt increase the 250 ap rewards, just everything else
[0:49:37] CritcobainTV: Damn, i meant to do a key on my rogue last night FeelsBadMan
[0:49:38] othraerir: the addon might not have taken the achievement into account
[0:50:06] othraerir: nvm seems it did
[0:50:21] PapaPing1: @Towelliee  Yeah everything but elite quest.  Its raids and wq
[0:50:36] Lexi__Marie: i thought you would be excited for a grind
[0:50:37] othraerir: check pvp
[0:50:41] MrGattz: yeah your not alone
[0:50:41] Ambersulfr: They waited too long to fix it imo, they should've done it sooner when people were still playing.
[0:50:46] cruzeal: ap PepeHands

[0:50:53] Jarlan23: yes
[0:50:53] nezz231: its a really good change tho because us that got everything in rank 3 are the ones that want more anima and we get it

[1:40:25] kroknows101: instead of 6 different colors of the same sets
[1:40:28] Feaver: No way. The nice part about tier sets is that it changed your dps rotation from tier to tier to keep things fresh
[1:40:41] assman_ny: Legion has some cool looking gear
[1:40:41] Wcvechten: Would people take another HD remake of an older tier? like t3 with current day graphics?

[1:41:12] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:41:16] Feaver: The current abilities do not change your rotation each tier.
[1:41:21] K_A_N_J_I: Tier sets could give utility and defensive enhancement for dps and healers and maybe a utility and damage component to tanks. @towelliee
[1:41:23] Barkybamboo: @Wcvechten no
[1:41:26] Gruffian: It felt bad when you had to keep a previous tiers gear to keep like a 2 piece bonus intact tho

[6:02:52] CritcobainTV: i'm like 85% sure it was cata with redirect
[6:03:10] dalaraz: comnbo on player than target is a wod change @Towelliee

[6:04:07] XshadowturkeyX: it was wod
[6:04:17] dalaraz: at least thats what wowwiki says with a fost combo points google search
[6:04:20] CritcobainTV: Redirect was implemented in cataclysm, so u could move your combo points over, But they made combo points on the player in wod, so you can swap targets and not lose them without using a spell
[6:04:22] Dejon09: That’s insane poor rogues
[6:04:29] MrGattz: well in blizzard terms soon is like 6-12 months so. it was pretty recent

[6:10:36] Broomba: true @MrGattz -- my iq level drops in his channel
[6:11:06] Exxcar: I'm just concerned what that would do to the market...
[6:11:11] Eternaalll: perpetual sub is a nice thing Kappa
[6:11:23] Exxcar: Would it have the same gold value between both retail and classic?
[6:11:42] Broomba: wow token in tbc is optional to buy it or not
[6:11:45] Exxcar: Cause 180k gold is pretty crazy for a TBC player
[6:11:59] YZIOHP: it wont be the same value
[6:12:16] dalaraz: poit is for a token to exist in the market somehow has to buy it for real money so it win win for bliz
[6:12:22] ravenoushydra: I don't know if they would catch up I think it would cause more inflation
[6:12:30] Noshpan: As someone who started playing WoW during TBC, I'm all for adding the token
[6:12:31] Shrenko: I guess 120 gold
[6:12:33] Darthyrevan: 300? fts
[6:12:36] Eternaalll: i think why ppl QQ is cause it invalidates their invested work into making those 10's of thousands :shrug:

[6:14:37] dalaraz: price depends on how many people will buy the token with real money compared to how many will buy it so price will go up prolly
[6:14:45] Ezekyler: princess Ony danAww
[6:14:56] Broomba: token is optional to buy
[6:15:19] ArcaneSyntax: wow servers will always be inflated because money is infinitely generated. you're always going to have inflation when money can drop everywhere.

[8:31:11] MrGattz: that sounds... less than fun?
[8:31:20] dimofodi: Or one can be realistic and know it's in Torghast so they could re-use assets to save time.
[8:31:24] MrGattz: yeah but its blizzard
[8:31:28] MrGattz: they would never make it fun
[8:31:32] grizzlyhorn: so is it just a build being uploaded to ptr? or is this playable?

[9:57:08] Streamcrush: so tyrande shows up to kill steal again

[9:58:11] Mr_Abeon: Tyrande's no a narcoleptic
[9:58:15] Mr_Abeon: now*
[9:58:19] Masqerader: no idea about flying, but I am pretty sure they said flying was part of renown, so.
[9:58:20] mpaul: looks like the last campaign quest stops at renown 59 meaning 6 weeks of the patch until flying? if it is 3 renown lvls a week
[9:58:21] Dinermoe: man i am so fucking tired but i cant stop watching you and stiven mining LUL
[9:58:30] Laelas_sm: check pathfinder achieve for flying requirements?
[9:59:02] PvtHudson093: Gondor seeks aid!!

[9:59:11] jasperboy: not pathfinder
[9:59:21] Masqerader: renown 48 might be it?
[9:59:25] brucezhu: in exploration section i believe
[9:59:25] idenkaz_: covernat senctum maybe
[9:59:26] Blackminuz: look at renown achi?
[9:59:29] Kromede: perhaps it's called jonjam
[9:59:30] jasperboy: Most likely just a quest or something in Oribos later on that makes u fly
[9:59:33] Throdio: Look under where the renown ones are?
[9:59:36] MindGames_187: looka t your future renown rewards
[10:00:00] fletch8: LET'S GO PogChamp
[10:00:05] UnearthedSin: I don't think flying is tied to renown. I am guessing it is unlocked during the storyline quest when you get the mount.
[10:00:06] Blackminuz: look at achi with renown?
[10:00:07] Tigerklaue: sylvanas took the sigil and left
[10:00:08] Eraste: @Towelliee Symbol of Hope on holy priest recovers 60 seconds of everyone's major defensive CD
[10:00:09] byrdeen45: they might just give it to us
[10:00:12] michaelmm: The renown rewards are in the UI - except for renown 41 - it is missing. So maybe it's the flying reward at 41?
[10:00:16] thiccsushi: So we going back to 3 renown a week naguuraThinking
[10:00:27] Blackminuz: see achi on campaign?
[10:00:43] Streamcrush: champion! I have a portal but I want you to run alllllll the way back
[10:00:43] TheRukis: when did ptr go live @Towelliee
[10:01:01] Masqerader: What about the "tiny wings"  at renown 48? if blizzard does some weird 2 renown per week that would make it a month for flying on par with pathfinders @Towelliee
[10:01:05] stratiss: can u see new zsone on the map?
[10:01:06] ChrisarN: You can go into Korthia @Towelliee
