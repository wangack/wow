[2:12:54] naijioo: On Gehenas the game feels dead, if you are not part of a GDKP community or a guild, it is very hard to find ICC raid. Its sad. They should promote even more  GDKP.
[2:12:58] Sawftw: @Icewit flanking hits harder if u weave
[2:13:03] DonPromilIo7: @Icewit because flanking strike does more dmg with 2.0
[2:13:04] rxcxx_: The actual problem with GDKP is it takes the community and guild interaction out of the ga,me
[2:13:06] rxcxx_: wow is a social game
[2:13:07] Denz0TV: @Topjunkrateu Cry more :)
[2:13:10] rxcxx_: or, was meant to be

[2:13:17] asist0ne: pikabooGo pikabooGo pikabooGo pikabooGo pikabooGo
[2:13:18] Icewit: @DonPromilIo7 si longer swing time = higher damage range right
[2:13:18] bm01: @Topjunkrateu See I'm actually on the other side of the spectrum, I would probably have stopped without gdkp because I can't put up with guilds anymore
[2:13:20] fakeGrimes: just get a guild then you wont have to bother with all these scummers running raids
[2:13:23] aSteamedTomato: Yeah, the only reason I'm bothering with pugs at all is that GDKPs basically don't exist on Wild Growth EU Horde side
[2:13:24] antonio_margareite: Customer EZ
[2:13:30] cuties_tw: make it 4g per run and get 4

[2:14:20] GrandmMaster: soylution kek
[2:14:20] grenis_: GDKP is too, the leader takes 20%????
[2:14:21] fleegle_: Baseg pug ms/os everything res
[2:14:24] lousmash: soylotion
[2:14:26] Sniper13x: i joined a rep run where the leader would hard reserve the first boe then reset and start all over
[2:14:28] brooch_fan: soylution ICANT
[2:14:28] bm01: @grenis_ It's generally 10%
[2:14:30] Harleybane: ohhh noes. ppl want to be payed for doing work, how odd
[2:14:32] aSteamedTomato: gdkp is a good system, compromised by gold buyers. gbid is just plain ibad.
[2:14:39] grenis_: @grenis_ No it's not
[2:14:43] elementzia: guild is way to go
[2:14:49] monkatos_andy: xddBased
[2:14:49] causemosmvp: GDKP is good until it locks out new players out of raiding unless they buy gold
[2:14:55] naijioo: Yes guild is boring you have to schedule, Pug u raid when you can / want. I cant be in a guild anymore tbh. So old school.
[2:14:57] Sndhelp: D:
[2:14:59] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: HUH
[2:15:02] aty_13: Bro 5 minutes are over stop yapping
[2:15:05] alexamarandi: anyone humble enough to take my freshly geared rogue to bfd :D ?
[2:15:06] Baway: except in TBC
[2:15:07] Bonic277: for me playing dkps with a lot of  people i can call friends since i play gdkp with them since woltk started and its much better then guild
[2:15:09] Peilo241: its sometimes just not possible because of work to make it every week same time for some people
[2:15:09] Gurrehh: pugging is fine, but this gs shit needs to go.
[2:15:13] LightBladeStream: @aSteamedTomato no, if leaders have no incentive to make raids, the game falls apart (pugs)
[2:15:24] deka7a: rip under the table
[2:15:30] monkatos_andy: yap
[2:15:34] In3s_8: RiP guilds

[2:16:00] d1zzyy: nobody cares about cata lmao
[2:16:00] LightBladeStream: @aSteamedTomato this is wrath, where you need a specific comp to raid unless you want to deal half dmg
[2:16:04] skrubbe: why ban ppl for soft res lol... its fair for everyone and no money included
[2:16:05] aty_13: For all the 100 ppl who will play Cata ICANT
[2:16:07] Karntar: just join cesspool guild with all the perks EZ
[2:16:13] rxcxx_: The problem that GDKP brings up is if you dont wanna be in a guild for raiding and want to pug,, a lot of decent pugs get absorbed by GDKP
[2:16:15] aSteamedTomato: @LightBladeStream My guy, you're delusional
[2:16:19] Papryk_: Wrath guilds are about officers giving items among each other
[2:16:23] tyriev: Is you rmic connected to a mixer? @JokerdTV
[2:16:23] LightBladeStream: @LightBladeStream no argument kek
[2:16:29] bm01: @causemosmvp I'm not sure that really ever happens tbh, you can be denied to join if you have a low budget but that's not very frequent. And after one or two, you have the budget.
[2:16:31] igrindthis: @rxcxx_ gdkp guilds, the next wave
