[0:25:14] happyheals: I am used to going until I give up at the end of an expac
[0:25:24] avenueone: sod in just over a week

[0:29:26] waitimdesyncd: I have 2 devokers, one has 2x silk and other has mettle + silk. The big mastery buff is noticeable since I went full haste
[0:29:45] waitimdesyncd: never tried lariat any of the seasons
[0:30:05] waitimdesyncd: yeah like my dh/dh/dk/me lobby, silk had no value in that shuffle
[0:30:35] avenueone: vers bracers?
[0:30:38] Dudewuut: verdant condiit
[0:30:39] happyheals: only reason I brought up the helm

[0:31:01] waitimdesyncd: ive tried 2x tether on my dk, and tether + mettle, but I havent found any teammates with 1 or 2 tether to test how much stat it gives
[0:31:07] nikthevoker: sup
[0:31:31] waitimdesyncd: Yikes D:
[0:31:34] happyheals: the chest with the conduit was the best I saw so far

[0:38:13] happyheals: sorry caps
[0:38:25] tumtuhm: it was fun!  I'll have to log on more on tuesdays, i have a bunch of alts i can help with
[0:39:04] waitimdesyncd: id love to try full haste with 2x silk on my dk for the sake of trying it
[0:39:06] xiliketurtlex: think ppl use verdant conduit alot cause of uptime. it just procs alot
[0:39:16] Dudewuut: check the buff i thought it was 298
[0:39:23] Dudewuut: in pvp
[0:40:27] Dudewuut: ah
[0:41:17] waitimdesyncd: I hoped the healing dart one would proc if I healed my pet or myself with deathstrike but it didnt seem to work LUL
[0:41:31] xiliketurtlex: ds doesnt proc it?
[0:41:52] waitimdesyncd: the healing dart one didnt proc for me
[0:42:13] waitimdesyncd: healing dart is extra healing on heals iirc
[0:42:15] americanmoses18: sup messss
[0:42:24] Im_Tarson: Hey hey chat and mes
[0:42:49] waitimdesyncd: hello tarson
[0:42:58] nikthevoker: hey mes is there any yway to make a WA that tracks your dmg modifiers? LUL
[0:43:20] happyheals: I pulled this from comments under conduit
[0:43:24] happyheals: A: stacks additively. Having two of them adds their stat procs together , just like dual sophic devotion. Expect about a 600 substats buff, 10sec duration, with two of them using Dream sparks.  B: very high 5 RPPM, but a 10s ICD, so it can't refresh or have multiple stats buffed concurrently.  C: result is that it has an effective 60-70% uptime. If it weren't for the icd and it could have multiple buffs / refresh it would probably have an 80%+ uptime and be actually objectively good for many
[0:43:25] Im_Tarson: Any ti0s for frost Dk in SS ? Other than dont play it lol
[0:43:43] Im_Tarson: Tips*
[0:43:50] cjc32: will you play cata at all?

[0:45:30] Eradivyn: @notmes
[0:45:43] Eradivyn: ah
[0:45:48] Im_Tarson: Frost feels hella squish
[0:46:05] tooch2: what comps are you guys thinking about bringing in the dk for tm?
[0:46:16] Im_Tarson: Feels really hard to play.
[0:46:40] tooch2: or is that top secret info lol
[0:46:53] Im_Tarson: At least in SS
[0:46:59] americanmoses18: dks place is the dumpster
[0:47:25] yuuwolfman: What is awc

[0:49:05] Im_Tarson: What do you think they could do for UH / frost to make them ok?
[0:49:35] Im_Tarson: Ya know thats a reallt good point
[0:49:39] yuuwolfman: Lol ghost crawler nerf
[0:50:04] Im_Tarson: Feel like frost leaves people at like 10 hp and runs put of gas where it would have killed before
[0:50:10] Im_Tarson: Out*
[0:50:15] Im_Tarson: Post the changes
[0:50:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not sure if you can sim a tournament realm character

[0:52:53] krome2dadome: said he was liking that build
[0:52:55] Dudewuut: so you think lariat even if both melee cleave members are running conduit and get the bonus?
[0:52:58] krome2dadome: (clawing)
[0:53:57] krome2dadome: lariat was like 30% uptime in the one game i saw someone using it
[0:53:59] happyheals: did they nerf the shadowflame patches?
[0:54:02] Dudewuut: conduit still 60-80% uptime
[0:54:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lariat is definitely not a bad pick
[0:54:26] waitimdesyncd: ive had 55-60% in a few games
[0:54:34] waitimdesyncd: but yeah
[0:54:43] krome2dadome: verdant was 43% uptime for me over all the games i played tonight
[0:54:59] Zzekz: evening homies
[0:55:58] Anhak: Kermit: You see that sick fisting I will be doing soon? thirty THIRTY FOUR Dee Pee Es.  adn then with my other hand THIRTY ONE Dee Pee Es.
[0:56:00] krome2dadome: yea if u like just want mastery it's prob better to play lariat
[0:56:13] Dudewuut: 75% of the stats are good though for conduit
[0:56:58] DeityRevert: what about when multiple people have verdant?
[0:57:29] Dudewuut: are you considering value cause the amount we get from any embellish really won’t be significant
[0:57:42] krome2dadome: what's ur uptime on silken as dk? on dh mine was like 60%
[0:59:05] krome2dadome: yea def bad at that uptime lolll

[1:01:45] krome2dadome: wasn't it hella nerfed?

[1:02:48] sunileif: you can use the tiered medalion on it

[1:03:45] waitimdesyncd: Im full socket on 2 chars and youre convincing me to go lariat today LUL
[1:04:17] waitimdesyncd: The helm with "shitty" crit stats that give damage to people that  hit you, would that be more overall value?
[1:05:01] waitimdesyncd: yeah they have to hit you for it to work
[1:05:22] happyheals: it heelps add to the need to heal

[1:07:33] ZuLu_MaFiA: is haste/vers the new meta? :P
[1:07:45] xiliketurtlex: chest tier also has big crit little mastery so might lose some stat if you go with flourishing helm
[1:08:09] krome2dadome: yea the helm was pretty ass
[1:08:10] waitimdesyncd: "Flourishing Dream Helmet" that gives shield is something I never tested and @xiliketurtlex  is right
[1:09:08] krome2dadome: @notmes https://imgur.com/a/nrEqRpb
[1:09:49] krome2dadome: no that was his own uptime
[1:09:58] krome2dadome: i ss from stream
[1:10:15] xiliketurtlex: maybe spore cloak. doesnt sp still use them?
[1:11:19] krome2dadome: def not a sporecloak angle
[1:12:22] waitimdesyncd: what about the tank necklace, has that been tested
[1:12:35] xiliketurtlex: minor stat from gem so air will proc haste

[3:53:41] healhut: tsg won blizzcon in 2009 right?
[3:54:28] happyheals: only thing shuffling is yourpine
[3:55:06] Lamatastisch: I think they should just nerf armor/necro wounds and then keep waiting how that works out
[3:55:22] Siegfried_TV: Hello mes, good evening, it is always a pleasure to see you play, a favor, can you link me or indicate what enchantment you have put on the belt when creating it... it cannot be seen in your armory

[3:58:59] dazuu_: its liek hey guys awc soon oh btw 1 week out heres a dampen meta
[3:59:14] dazuu_: do they have a full pvp team at blizz?
[3:59:53] dazuu_: or do they have bob from mythic plus to come over and guess what may be good for pvp?
[4:00:06] healhut: at least you guys have some pretty strong comps for this season

[4:01:22] WagwanBombaClatBomba: never awc viable
[4:02:44] healhut: lol yeah that's a good point
[4:02:50] dazuu_: i thought they did all these change bc ppl were complaining about sub rogue 1 shotting
[4:03:42] Lamatastisch: i miss necro strike so much
[4:04:04] dazuu_: so whats the difference between awc and ladder? as far as the changes
[4:04:06] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i hate the necrotic wound nerfs
[4:04:54] WagwanBombaClatBomba: y
[4:05:12] igni1: what are the odds we see u on frost in the tourny ?
[4:05:19] dazuu_: like if they didnt change things to fit awc what impact would that have ?
[4:06:05] dazuu_: im just saying over all not justr dk
[4:06:12] happyheals: it is looking like they are to get nerfed again
[4:06:29] happyheals: when they are looking good
[4:07:00] noname_xy: Feels like DK dmg right now doenst have an impact at all, atleast in shuffles.
[4:07:16] jacob_the_mage: Meanwhile warlock is broken asf
[4:07:22] jacob_the_mage: Imo
[4:07:27] dazuu_: so they are balancing based on solo shuffle?
[4:08:11] WagwanBombaClatBomba: the dk dmg nerf didnt seem alot but everyone got more hp and dmg feels way less rn
[4:08:27] dazuu_: i see all the sub rogues going outlaw so they took away "set up comps" in a way?

[4:19:11] al_capow: the blood moon event sounds so so crazy
[4:19:59] al_capow: oh yes I love it
[4:20:03] al_capow: "blood fog"
[4:20:19] al_capow: we need to set up a guerilla 5 man to cap around
[4:20:32] al_capow: from what I understand, some of the runes are fake to troll dataminers
[4:22:10] al_capow: hunter is becoming an enh shaman next phase basically
[4:22:22] skidetko: my winrate in solo shuffle staggered i can't win any games i was able to get 2.6 consistently now i m hardstuck 2.4 & i just tanked below 2.4 what is going on
[4:22:27] happyheals: at 60 a full rune set sends your character to retail to play
[4:23:38] al_capow: hunter fd into frost trap and melee dps is going to be super fun gameplay
[4:24:10] al_capow: dont forget the melee dps rune in phase one with no pet
[4:24:16] al_capow: so it might stack pretty hard
[4:24:41] al_capow: people are also thinking of hunter tank using the shaman aspect of the alpha rune
[4:24:54] forsakenzxc: gl tomorrow mes!
[4:25:18] michaelss_: Mes did you see you can outbreak observer finally !!
[4:25:21] michaelss_: huggeee
[4:25:26] happyheals: hunter is disengaging
[4:26:08] michaelss_: actually if they track your runic power and drop it
[4:26:14] michaelss_: you are out of the game
[4:26:25] michaelss_: well before
[4:26:30] krome2dadome: @happyheals i heard him chuckle as he read
[4:27:11] Begasaur: im excited for my tank shaman in phase 2
[4:27:28] krome2dadome: what did warr get
[4:27:32] krome2dadome: get to the good stuff
[4:27:34] happyheals: he got that Chrome Dome
[4:27:58] Begasaur: i know its fun, but tank is still so strong i get to just DPS and tank
[4:28:17] happyheals: they will have so many choices that People will start complaining
[4:28:49] happyheals: I like sod
[4:28:50] Begasaur: and with all the physical damage coming from SM and stuff ill actually be able to use a shield and get shield mastery
[4:29:01] happyheals: it is a great take
[4:29:19] happyheals: I have a priest and feral druid aty 25
[4:29:23] Begasaur: were trying to bring back DnT on crusader strike, we have 6 of  the og vanilla crew atm
[4:30:09] al_capow: I think they'll get the most success if people just feel like they're having fun
[4:30:12] happyheals: if it is big enough inside people will find ways to make it difficult
[4:30:18] al_capow: and having more outlets for pvp/arena
[4:30:59] simszszy: <3
[4:30:59] happyheals: They have a good start
[4:31:09] Begasaur: SoD challenge modes
[4:31:18] happyheals: if they fix the massive gold farmers
[4:31:21] al_capow: thats why I think they need more pvp modes as well
[4:31:25] al_capow: like classic shuffle
[4:31:35] al_capow: since other players are they hardest content imo
[4:31:51] al_capow: but yeah having something like mythic+ in classic would be cool as well
[4:36:15] austin_545: what time is AWC
[5:01:31] Begasaur: I just did a random m+ with a shaman named Cdude. thankfully he was quiet

[7:15:48] krome2dadome: @notmes before I pass out, wanted the share this post. cool little graphic and helped me understand why certain ppl complain about certain specs ;) it’s basically a time lapse from 0-2800 in shuffle rating that shows spec representation along the way https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/s/7GD0FbYbGb
[7:16:19] rembrandt89: what did you do on tr dk ele an ret?

[7:18:05] Zurgok: heya notmes, my friends are playing rdruid+fury warrior - which spec warlock should i play for max rating push?
[7:18:20] shugguls: arms gets crippled after 2k raiting
[7:18:39] sunileif: arms shouldnt be able to make it past 2k gotcha
[7:18:52] officalsovereign: spriest straight in the shitter

[7:20:34] avenueone: why dhs fine but not dks fine
[7:21:21] amSLC: they fake giving the nerf to rogues and give to UH
[7:21:24] shugguls: thats the one in the cell, where rogue is busted and they nurf dk with a bat
[7:21:38] amSLC: yeah that one
[7:21:51] Devcomz: Oddly enough I hate Dh more than I hate Rogues on my alts im not familiar with
[7:22:00] Devcomz: just annoys me greatly
[7:22:09] shugguls: @Devcomz same

[7:23:08] LarissaGPlays: NotLikeThis
[7:23:29] humrai: Demon hunter is overpowered, so we have decided to appropriately nerf death knight
[7:23:41] sunileif: i need that on a loop
[7:23:52] sunileif: just blizz pummeling rogues
[7:24:37] waitimdesyncd: Blizzard: We continue to closely monitor data on class performance as well as player feedback. We’ve developed the following adjustments to classes that are over- and under-performing in group content and PvP. We have concluded DH is performing as we want to to, and UHDK was overeprforming
[7:24:41] waitimdesyncd: literally from their blue post
[7:24:43] Mythh_93: i mean frost dk has been unviable for how long at this point
[7:25:15] waitimdesyncd: rip the last part of the message sry, but its copied from blizzards bluepost when they nerfed DK
[7:25:49] avenueone: i heard of sum1 seeing sum1 getting 1 in lfr this week
[7:26:24] DenounceTV: still no leggo mes?
[7:27:03] DenounceTV: i clear hc each week on 2 rets and 2 dk still dont have it
[7:28:02] archtme: is there still a link to mesui_castbars?

[7:29:02] Devcomz: Mes thanks for Streaming Glad to be here :)
[7:29:42] avenueone: nah gotta head off soon
[7:29:57] Mythh_93: i think that shaman was asking for 2s
[7:30:03] Mythh_93: Alexustexas
[7:30:14] avenueone: the druid u played with earlier
[7:30:14] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[7:30:16] avenueone: was asking in twitch chat

[7:31:37] sunileif: then i solo fyrak's echo
[7:31:49] sunileif: so nest bloomish
[7:32:51] sunileif: superbloom woulda gone faster if i used the give a group member a quest thing
[7:37:13] eMBeaR64oz: alright whats the move
[7:38:16] avenueone: morgan: The Move is an AWC Team with Pikaboo Wizk Absterge and Jellybeans
[7:40:46] gearzih: max effort

[7:43:04] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[7:43:54] eMBeaR64oz: can do dk 2s or something else in 3s if you want
[7:44:10] eMBeaR64oz: summoning krome would be mean ima prolly be gone soon
[7:44:24] eMBeaR64oz: although i did old man nap for like 3 hours at like 8pm
[7:45:30] eMBeaR64oz: btw saw that the uber version of wow next expansion has early access
[7:45:40] eMBeaR64oz: dont think ima buy that tho i dont like supporting that style of idea XD
[7:45:44] eMBeaR64oz: just goin for base
[7:46:01] eMBeaR64oz: it basically is required tho as a streamer
[7:46:06] eMBeaR64oz: which sucks for them to be forced into that
[7:46:29] sunileif: early access no longer means what it used too
[7:46:34] sunileif: cause people cry
[7:46:42] atrocityxd: I understood early access for Diablo and CoD. But for a game like wow that's super shady
[7:47:08] handitommy93: dose anyone have the legendary 2h axes that drops ?
[7:47:16] sunileif: early access in d4 was basically you paid to QA test for them
[7:47:40] sunileif: thats actually all blizz uses it for now
[7:47:44] atrocityxd: LUL
[7:48:03] eMBeaR64oz: they did it for  starfield too
[7:48:08] eMBeaR64oz: a single player game
[7:48:16] sunileif: why pay play testers when you can manipulate players into paying you to test it
[7:48:43] sunileif: and then throw shade at sperior games liek bg3
[7:49:17] asdkl2312k3o: @notmes its better those who want access gets it
[7:49:19] sunileif: if it was a real beta sure
[7:50:01] sunileif: ;o
[7:50:02] asdkl2312k3o: @notmes thats what I mean, give it to those willing to pay
[7:50:12] asdkl2312k3o: that way u get those who really cares about beta giving feedback
[7:50:31] asdkl2312k3o: less feedback can be better since it isnt as much and probably better too
[7:50:31] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes

[7:58:49] FoxiekittenWoW: today
[8:00:39] FoxiekittenWoW: have you guys discussed in the team for you to not main dk anymore, it seems to rare that dk is any good in tournament play? :)
[8:01:46] eMBeaR64oz: ele a possibility
[8:02:04] eMBeaR64oz: i assume most teams are gonna just be outlaw with lock, boomy or arcane
[8:02:12] didgeridoo1001: Ele DH still good?
[8:02:31] shugguls: @didgeridoo1001 strong in EU
[8:02:35] afriKENx: ret outlaw any chance at being good?
[8:03:24] afriKENx: yeah fair
[8:03:24] StreamElements: ana_ammar just subscribed for 20 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso

[8:04:50] Yoskexz: whats outlaw weakness? another rog? KEKW
[8:04:58] afriKENx: can blade fury through turtle too KEKW
[8:05:07] shugguls: @Yoskexz nurfs
[8:05:37] shugguls: only thing stronger than 1 outlaw is double outlaw again
[8:05:49] Yoskexz: cloak talent shud replace evasion or somethin
[8:06:14] shugguls: @Yoskexz i would add foeberance to it
[8:06:27] FoxiekittenWoW: i heard trill saying yesterday that he got in vanish down to 16 sec cd in one of their games, that seems so absurd
[8:06:34] Yoskexz: pirates of the carribean 6 Pog
[8:06:38] FoxiekittenWoW: his
[8:07:11] sunileif: oh yaaaa RMZzZzZzZzZzzzzzzzz AWC
[8:07:42] shugguls: So mes , i have an idea to fix pvp rating, how about if you lost u dont lose rating, would fix so much.
[8:07:57] OptiTV_: dk ams opener?
[8:08:17] itsraken: rogues are the most obnoxious lil rats in terms of CDs and out of jails.
[8:08:30] Yoskexz: rogues do their openers vs hunter wif evasion to avoid scatter Madge
[8:09:04] FoxiekittenWoW: @shugguls how would that fix anything? at that point the highest rated player is just the one who plays thge most and not the best
[8:09:16] sunileif: give kidney shot back to hunter
[8:09:18] OptiTV_: Idk I watch dks ams for fun and dont get punished until ams is back up again
[8:09:47] shugguls: @FoxiekittenWoW you still have to win and mmr will still decrease if u lose
[8:09:49] afriKENx: @Yoskexz axe toss to Madge
[8:10:03] ConnorB14: why not hunter
[8:10:06] wyldeshock: good morning everybody
[8:10:27] FoxiekittenWoW: kasu won a cup in shadowlands
[8:10:31] FoxiekittenWoW: as jungle
[8:10:31] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[8:10:49] FoxiekittenWoW: hmm
[8:10:49] afriKENx: @FoxiekittenWoW yeah but that entire cup wasnt jungles
[8:10:59] FoxiekittenWoW: i think jungle was alright
[8:11:04] afriKENx: LG won a cup as cupid
[8:11:16] afriKENx: doesnt mean it wasnt rogue meta
[8:11:16] sunileif: give hunter a deocy ability that leaves behind a fake hunter while the hunter stealths away
[8:11:40] FoxiekittenWoW: i agree with you, the meta has been kinda stale for a long time
[8:11:51] OptiTV_: kasu didnt face any ret war team and they countered all the other comps
[8:12:54] Yoskexz: do u think rets r not gd rn? how come u guys dont use it
[8:13:41] asdkl2312k3o: what are rets bad into?
[8:13:42] jackobson917: ret feel bad rn vs cloth
[8:13:43] nargonisttv: wanna do some 2s?
[8:14:03] Yoskexz: i feel like sam does well when he qs dh ret into arcane comps
[8:14:17] Yoskexz: but maybe they have to play rly insane idk
[8:14:38] FoxiekittenWoW: i think a strong comp you could have is double shaman/dh, i think you could win most druid healers with that comp
[8:14:57] FoxiekittenWoW: druid seems to oom quite fast after changes
[8:15:02] jyeclark: How long until AWC?
[8:15:18] flameohotmann: what time does open bracket start? im in a different timezone trying to figure out when to watch it
[8:15:19] angelus1100: !drops
[8:15:19] StreamElements: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23999066/dragonflight-twitch-drops-get-the-dashing-buccaneers-slops-transmog-now
[8:15:34] Yoskexz: well in that case nothing rly counters arcane tho
[8:15:44] Yoskexz: not even hunters have a easy time vs them
[8:16:54] FoxiekittenWoW: double shaman is rly good into arcane/druid, thats what ive heard from lontar and also mvqs team
[8:17:32] afriKENx: that earthshield bug
[8:17:36] afriKENx: is so awful
[8:17:57] Yoskexz: does the hpal purge bug fk over arcane x)
[8:18:02] FoxiekittenWoW: im not sure about the earthshield thing
[8:18:11] FoxiekittenWoW: but double shaman can keep druid from never drinking
[8:18:27] FoxiekittenWoW: and shaman mana is much better than druids after the changes
[8:18:29] afriKENx: i used to hate shaman class stacking but
[8:18:33] FoxiekittenWoW: so thats the theory i guess
[8:18:34] saiyan333: it over writes the resto shield buff healing
[8:18:42] afriKENx: idk if that change was the solution
[8:19:58] Yoskexz: oh ele boomy sounds p nice
[8:20:04] eMBeaR64oz: against an hpal they get a lot from their tier, super hard to purge bop sometimes
[8:21:33] wardelswijk: spellsteal just insane for arcane
[8:24:05] Yoskexz: dude their slow is just as strong as dk
[8:24:22] Yoskexz: crippling 66%
[8:24:58] FoxiekittenWoW: the only thing outlaw doesn´t have is big burst
[8:25:01] billionairebooked: excited for dampening world championship
[8:25:27] ninex8: play blood kd
[8:25:29] Yoskexz: he has a lota rogs
[8:26:04] oWcsgo: Whazz had 1 rogue from start season with crit just for outlaw only
[8:26:27] wyldeshock: wanna 2s some?

[8:27:09] nargonisttv: was about to sign up
[8:27:21] centerror: 4pm est then
[8:27:33] FoxiekittenWoW: maybe sub was better when people didn´t have much gear, just like disc was really strong early this season but then people got gear and they fell of massively
[8:28:25] FoxiekittenWoW: not saying sub ever fell of but it discouraging  people from trying outlaw
[8:28:47] Tiebot87: @notmes what time AWC start today?
[8:28:53] centerror: how does the average Joe even join the awc?

[9:00:05] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[9:00:46] shugguls: is that a bad thing though, u still need to win and ppl will play more so u dont wait till end of season
[9:01:19] shugguls: tbh they could test it in solo
[9:04:16] wyldeshock: the warrior
[9:04:20] shugguls: but that all happens now in solo
[9:04:23] wyldeshock: gatekeeping my 1600
[9:04:28] wyldeshock: against all odds
[9:04:32] shugguls: so its no diffrent
[9:04:41] Zoortha: are you rdy for awc ? :D
[9:07:00] shugguls: as i see it , ppl sit there rating and dont play so why not reward the people that actively play, again they still have to win, u maybe right on the mmr issue but in sure that can be solved
[9:09:47] wyldeshock: who knew the grip would work
[9:10:07] suterama: mes do u have an ig?
[9:10:08] shugguls: @wyldeshock that it did

[9:47:40] petkicklol: lariat interesting
[9:48:17] shugguls: FYI - Player versus Player Iridal, the Earth’s Master damage-on use-effect now deals 10% of its damage (was 30%) in PvP combat. Death Knight Unholy Resolved an issue causing Outbreak to not apply Virulent Plague to enemy totems, Psyfiend, and Observer.
