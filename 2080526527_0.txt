[0:52:59] madabber_: terrible reason
[0:53:01] yucknothanks: I love when people think if they take stuff they’ll just get big. you gonna have to workout more than you now anyway so might as well just do the work normally. then if you plateau - take stuff (if you want)
[0:53:06] madabber_: thats how you fuck your body up
[0:53:07] yucknothanks: buncha silly willies out here
[0:53:07] Wutanggggg: a good reason would maybe be recovery. if youre all busted up. or real low test maybe

[0:56:35] sugawolf92: Yo, how you doing on this fine sunday afternoon?
[0:56:41] mac_y2k: i think just supplement copium is super bad tho, supplement space is completely unregulated and consuming 9000% RDA of things is prob not good on your system

[1:12:03] Toastlandx: tauren are usually not allowed to ride raptors right? if so this is kinda special
[1:12:07] strongtulkas: what happened to your eyebrow?

[1:12:41] Stubb21: hey warrior chat and @SONII is it worth raiding as 1h fury if i dont have a feral with mangle/WS??

[1:13:54] imperfects: im pretty upset how they're shafting warrior man
[1:14:02] eskivoart: "Warriors are fine"
[1:14:02] dognutzxd: warrior doesn't fit in with these phases for sure
[1:14:04] elementzia: yep
[1:14:08] sudd7: It would be nice to have a skullsplitter, bladestorm, shockwave, or something like that. like everyone else got. instead of a bunch of modifiers
[1:14:08] videohorse: mages getting 50+ coins per stv event is broken
[1:14:11] FleetOfPigeons: wtf was that hunter doing? KEKW

[1:14:20] TripHH: its the same as with arms in retail, they have no love for us
[1:14:21] Fnafson: They probably believe we will scale with gear blah blah
[1:14:22] Nucstorm: "Working as intended"
[1:14:22] Unframed_: I think its because theyre afraid the other classes will cry their eyeballs out if war gets good stuff
[1:14:29] Dimpleshift: thats how ranged hunter feels
[1:14:47] elementzia: im fine being worse at 40-50, just make us CRANNNKKKK at 60 !!
[1:14:52] dognutzxd: @Dimpleshift ranged hunter isn't bad, it's really gear dependent
[1:15:07] FleetOfPigeons: @SONII its because your hair is infront of your eyebrow so its blockin it i think
[1:15:07] last_real_gamer: @sonii blade storm rune p3 confirmed
[1:15:07] hypnoidal: Yo Dr. Sony

[1:18:26] videohorse: warriors cant play blood moon, they arent part of the cool kids club
[1:18:53] JokiGhostCrew: is this the raptor from STV?
[1:18:55] OloCdn: I honestl just like PvP so warriors feel "bleh" without a healer..be nice to get something that allows us to survive a little bit better.
[1:18:56] Unframed_: Well, we might win the lottery sooner than actual war buffs by now LUL
[1:19:04] future21_: they are doing this cuz warriors are gonna be nutty in future phases and they also dont want everyone to play warrior
[1:19:14] videohorse: you think 5 silver is good on your war, mages walk out with over 50
[1:19:20] holme08: They honestly need to make warriors feel more sustainable. Make bloodthirst insane.
[1:19:22] Curtbrainfre3z: holy fuck look at that big throbbing axe soniiLewd

[1:22:12] Brendon0769: What standing desk do you have?
[1:22:42] videohorse: eat clen, tren hard, anavar give up
[1:22:47] JakobiMedia: @envy_4500 I really want to learn my rogue class and try to raid (never did as a kid) and maybe try to get into duelinng and PVP
[1:23:16] extashy1: why you don’t use rend on targets, Sonii? :)
[1:23:20] ZzZanu: @elementzia would you use AB belt / 17 str belt instead? if the +3 axe worthless with bosses being only 2 lvls higher?
[1:23:32] envy_4500: @JakobiMedia if your looking for like arenas id say retail or WOTLK would be the way to go but just dueling raiding and BGS u can do in SoD
[1:23:45] FleetOfPigeons: OK hear me out.. RANGED warrior in SOD.

[1:32:09] Monsowhs: Honestly shield reflect would be insane
[1:32:12] Synthez542: warriors been on the copium train since before p1

[1:32:17] MolonvLabe: why dont the devs care about warriors :(
[1:32:25] teadanman: they could do st and mara raids, just to add more content
[1:32:31] Fnafson: Mass spell reflect pog

[1:32:38] Monsowhs: But would be nice to have a spell reflect with the amount of dps no?
[1:32:46] Bee_On_Co: Titan's Grip would absolutely HIT.
[1:32:46] gambleragain: Sunken Temple 20 man raids sounds cool.
[1:32:51] Skeetin_: its been World of Warriorcraft for ever
[1:32:53] vepsee: classic war was the only complete class design wise, its been said plenty of times by devs in the past
[1:32:59] vepsee: every other class had major issues
[1:33:01] Colamitus: they are about to find out what the game looks like without warrs
[1:33:06] TheTrueShayde: SONII MY GUY

[1:33:09] soapbargoeshard: did you find the firewood at the gas station sonii???
[1:33:17] Fnafson: They should give us a banner that can summon ppl like warlock so we got some raid utility
[1:33:35] iiTzCrayZ: I thought with plate armor warriors would be way stronger this phase but I was def wrong 😭
[1:33:38] Skeetin_: i watched an Era raid the other day it was 28 Warriors ....
[1:33:45] Unframed_: Hope they combine battle shout and command into one shout
[1:34:26] vepsee: so whats like the biggest things you'd want to round out war in pvp, self sustain? more cc?

[1:36:43] vepsee: @Nucstorm rogues got shadowstrike
[1:36:45] Fnafson: Tazte for blood would be clunky imo
[1:36:50] Wicks_TV: don't think second wind would help you'd get 1 shot through it
[1:36:57] Fnafson: With tbe stance dancing
[1:37:08] Unframed_: We already know we get taste
[1:37:09] roebinho7: damn undead warrior looks so cool. do you really thing tauren stomp is that much better than wotf?

[3:26:49] rikoswauvey: @danmand00d I'm saying would he even waste huis time with her...? She's probably a horrible lay
[3:26:54] ppppo_pO: KEKW 󠀀
[3:26:55] therealthracian: xaryu sounds 15

[3:27:23] dumbsra: he never posted a thirst trap Sadge
[3:27:26] B1oobear: If you want my true and honest opinion I think it has a lot to do with who you do or don't know for example if you have almost no one in your life even family or if you know the right people to support your decision and lifestyle and once you do it you kind of can't revert it so idk.
[3:27:28] r0nin_xd: i told her hes more jacked and doesnt even sound like him
[3:27:30] st0neh: @Nyur0 Nah it's Payo Kappa

[3:28:48] rikoswauvey: @danmand00d Exactly. And my point is, she thinks she's hotter than she is therefore they don't try in bed.

[3:29:12] thisisnotanick: an OF will probably a mental drain
[3:29:18] B1oobear: Yes there would probably be some family tension hopefuly not too serious or permanent...
[3:29:22] rikoswauvey: @danmand00d It's 100% true...

[5:01:37] testiklees3: @metalgrip Thanks for the gift sub!
[5:01:44] Shepp22: but if we’re strictly talking about powdered protein grass fed doesn’t matter. grass feeding effects the fat content, and not the protein content
[5:01:44] gwk_exclusive: depends when you process them

[5:01:49] AstronapTV: cows worth

[5:02:54] testiklees3: <3
[5:02:55] SamMorito: problem with making more money is life style creep
[5:03:01] Shepp22: grass feeding a cow really increases the omega fat. doesn’t effect the protein (at least lean muscle protein) so grass fed meat only effects the fat content
[5:03:06] gwk_exclusive: agreed
[5:03:07] gameradio: You still thinking about moving out to Texas with the others? lol

[5:05:10] Ddocz: but real talk tho, I haven't gone out in a couple years
[5:05:11] momentai_xo: i don't know how to make friends :/
[5:05:16] gameradio: depends on how the gaming life  is going, it helps, but if you play solo player games sucks
[5:05:19] realfitty: Not that I don't like socializing, I am just perfectly content being alone
[5:05:55] tomfxs: Did vanlife for a year a lot of alone time, very healthy but met a lot of strangers that made me become much better of a human
[5:05:58] Shepp22: my brother does research in older dementia patients. a major factor is seclusion and being social
[5:06:10] kevinxdelgado: did you get hit on by any Japanese girls?
[5:06:10] essadis: karaoke nights are fun
