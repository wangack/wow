[1:03:03] TFTCurse: so he lost smth else
[1:03:27] moodsen: yoyo @Naowh and chat. hows mdi prac going? rdy for number 7?
[1:03:45] nicht_oli__: @Samurayny 1 more holy power for 20% dmg Kappa
[1:04:06] Samurayny: is that bad ?

[1:04:50] Ruinx81: Why isn‚Äôt Naowh doing the real meta tank: BDK
[1:04:51] mrduckytom: @ypperlig how many of them won mdi?

[1:06:26] TFTCurse: https://imgur.com/IVF6azk
[1:06:27] csombokrobin: corrupting rage better than tepid versa?
[1:06:34] kaverrr: This is going to be‚Ä¶ legendary
[1:06:35] cloudberrylive: checking high keys without context of knowing the team or video means that the build is kinda useless, prio damage might be needed from one of the players, etc - different people can have different roles
[1:06:49] TFTCurse: for every tyra key
[1:07:07] ypperlig: @mrduckytom bro apply lube his salami is getting sore from all the friction

[1:08:36] redfield83: Tchou tchou HypeNotLikeSnow
[1:08:36] tvilk: isnt augery semi-bad for ret? I dont play pala so idk
[1:08:42] tvilk: compared to other trinekts
[1:08:52] moomoostrike: signet
[1:08:55] Samurayny: what about cata brand trinket ?
[1:08:55] moomoostrike: realy good
[1:09:04] nicht_oli__: im running fyrakk tank trinket on ret LUL the dmg is quite good and i never die
[1:09:04] linguinetoes: @ypperlig What did he mean by this?
[1:09:06] Exogenesis9: It's probably still reasonable at 496 for fort weeks.
[1:09:23] tvilk: @nicht_oli__ yeh its good in higher keys where the shield is useful
[1:09:30] Eltiima: rezan?
[1:09:33] Razzeu: signet is so good on vdh but sucks to keep it up Madge
[1:09:33] Kingcoconutcrab: MIrror
[1:09:34] Exogenesis9: Could try ember/crab?
[1:09:35] Kingcoconutcrab: maybe
[1:09:42] moomoostrike: signet isnt good for doti
[1:09:43] tvilk: naowh have you considered zooming out you cam a bit

[1:10:02] Asiaakk: crab+ashes its ok
[1:10:05] Allarai_: smolderon on use is pretty good no?
[1:10:05] Exogenesis9: Ember of Nullification/Crab are just the only decent AoE trinkets in M+
[1:10:11] tvilk: it looks like you're coming closer to kiss me idk feels weird, not but but like.. different.
[1:10:19] Leadycake: How do you feel about the legendary changes?
[1:10:20] Bungck: Bungck subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! pog
[1:10:29] Exogenesis9: Yeah, that's why I preferred Ember vs Crab.
[1:11:01] Bungck: The ultimate floorpov
[1:11:10] Exogenesis9: Double Ret and the mage gets PI? Disgrace.
[1:11:10] jarilrpg: yup, ret definitely needs those buffs
[1:11:11] tvilk: im considering gearing a melee dps but idk what.. maybe rogue is just a safe choice
[1:11:11] nicht_oli__: poor mage , everything is dead before he even starts doing dmg
[1:11:16] moomoostrike: look at mage :D
[1:11:24] Telomir: @nicht_oli__ gg
[1:11:28] cloudberrylive: mage is baiting guys so his dps is kinda secondary to that
[1:11:51] Nudel_Schupser: Pepega Clap
[1:11:52] Exogenesis9: I mean it's also mage on tyran week. Shit dies before he ramps.
[1:11:55] XadrOwO: 3 ret is the play for mdi i heard
[1:12:19] Kiss0fdead: cant play more then 1
[1:12:19] Exogenesis9: Why only 3 Ret? Don't need healer if you have enough Ret.
[1:12:32] saulith: @XadrOwO fully paladin team is the play no? think of all the utility
[1:12:34] Telomir: 5 ret or 4 ret/1prot Kappa
[1:12:51] DirtyYankee0: 3 ret 1 prot 1 hpal Pog
[1:12:52] Exogenesis9: 4 Ret + 1 VDH for the mark
[1:12:56] XadrOwO: you dont need int buff with 5 paladins true
[1:12:58] XadrOwO: 5head
[1:13:41] Exogenesis9: The 4 Rets just take lightforged blessing and always Divine Storm. Perfectly competent healing right there
[1:13:44] Telomir: mage seething rn
[1:13:48] Orionje_: other ret has the legendary as well?
[1:14:01] Don_Kana: what is the addon called giving the ‚Äûfrontal‚Äú ‚Äûpersonal‚Äú ‚Äûkick‚Äú ‚Äûdispell‚Äú calls? is it a weakaura?

[2:42:29] 4dmk: do you divine storm on 2 targets or more?
[2:42:44] DeadSlugg: 2 targets DS does more iirc
[2:42:56] DeadSlugg: If you're runnin ghte projectionj talent (whcih you should)
[2:42:57] StreamElements: You can see Robin's talents and in-depth explanations behind them when subscribing to his Patreon or find similar builds on WoWHead
[2:43:43] CORNY_derEchte: why divine arbiter tho? Is the cleave worth anything or just for the 5% ST on holydmg
[2:44:01] AramusRet: god lvl music
[2:44:22] DeadSlugg: I have no idea why they buffed Ret's AoE. They could ahve just buffed Templar's Verdict by 30% and left the rest and then the weakness of Ret would be fixed
[2:44:48] ImNetso: imagine if tank breath was still a thing here
[2:44:55] CORNY_derEchte: No, it would be OP in raid then @DeadSlugg
[2:44:57] DeadSlugg: DA is good for high Tyr keys because of the ST damage it gives. You pretty much can ignore it in AoE
[2:45:16] CORNY_derEchte: Bc The Reckoning vs Sentence is the problem there
[2:45:22] DeadSlugg: @CORNY_derEchte Last I checked Ret is down bad in raid, hence the need for some ST buffs
[2:45:29] dontbeachad123: feels bad to not have lego, this far into the season.

[2:47:21] bingbongsanchez22: :o
[2:47:21] kookihunt: Show overall dmg
[2:47:30] DeadSlugg: @Ïû¨ÏπòÏûàÎäî Ret is currently 6th from the bottom. Not terrible, not great either
[2:47:35] CORNY_derEchte: how much haste u got?
[2:47:44] CORNY_derEchte: I dont have much, but can only fit 2 of 3 too
[2:47:52] Beastmode127: too much haste feels abit bad true
[2:48:21] 4dmk: what % haste do you have?

[2:48:55] 4dmk: wow armory bug
[2:49:00] cosmin284: have fun fuegoGaming
[2:49:01] 4dmk: look how much # haste they have
[2:49:03] grimleeeper: @AthoosHS they dont, armory is bugged
[2:49:15] AthoosHS: @grimleeeper how come?

[2:50:04] RageTimer1: RageTimer1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:50:17] grimleeeper: the haste calculation % isnt right, my ret has 25% ingame and armory shows it as 52%
[2:50:58] myseriouse: u have frostfire legs on the armory?
[2:51:02] CORNY_derEchte: 36% haste is what most guys have
[2:51:05] cosmin284: take care everyone have the best amazing happy new year 2024 and a  awesome  day and night fuegoL fuegoH <3
[2:51:19] DeadSlugg: DP on Tyr weeks with DA is insane actually
[2:51:31] sarpogne: Why do you think ret pal is not meta‚Ä¶ dmg is super good‚Ä¶ its tanky and got lots of utilities‚Ä¶
[2:51:37] fremen14: yall should focus on your rotation instead of obsessing over stats fr
[2:51:45] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[2:51:59] CORNY_derEchte: ret lacks ST dmg esp w/o leggo
[2:52:04] Arkshol: i mean ret aint that complex anyways

[2:52:23] gr0zlee: Everyone got that lagspike!
[2:52:25] gr0zlee: I got it too
[2:52:39] dvs84: hate when the lagspikes drag you into frontals kek
[2:52:53] DeadSlugg: @Ïû¨ÏπòÏûàÎäî Overcapping is recommended if it means you get another Judgement out with the 4 Set
[2:53:18] Arkshol: didnt say it was easy just aint complex
[2:53:24] DeadSlugg: Well not recommended, but you should press Judgement if you've got it up. Sometimes you proc and it caps
[2:53:33] Arkshol: just look at outlaw for example lmao
[2:54:40] decodiaz: how come u playing dps?
