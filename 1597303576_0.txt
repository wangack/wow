[2:17:21] BronxBomber__: Under the new policy, streamers with premium terms will keep 70 percent of their subscription revenue on the first $100,000 earned. But after that, the share will go down to a 50 / 50 split. The changes kick into effect on June 1st, 2023, and even then only when a streamer’s contract with Twitch is up for renewal, according to a blog post from Twitch president Dan Clancy.

[8:32:27] ItsDerpDiggler: @HeIlraiser_ Not really, i'm an old school MMORPG player and even back on SWG etc we ALL used macros. Macros are part of pretty much any good MMO. Always have been.
[8:33:24] oddskittles: @PJKlips you can get a whole WA set up from wago, just google feral WA set up and find one that you like
[8:33:43] p4u1yb: @oddskittles thanks even for tbc?
[8:34:13] oddskittles: yea most of them will specifiy if its TBC, wotlk etc

[8:40:20] ItsDerpDiggler: @HeIlraiser_ It's not rules, it's just standard practice for any MMO. Gaming is filled with people who like technology and games... The way you phrased it makes it sound like you're saying that people who use macros etc don't know how to "play the game". It actually takes a lot more intellect
