[1:53:28] Mecabeast: and the idea of the dark zone in the division was amazing.
[1:53:45] tloh: what server is hammer squad on chat?

[1:55:46] bruhSit_farmer: need to experience the zones too with everyone out and about, thats what mmo's are all about
[1:55:52] Dalsonson: I’ve heard it’s like 16-17 hours a level doing dungeon slamming for rep farm, anyone know if that’s accurate?
[1:56:20] xViewersunitedx: toweeli you plan on tanking right?
[1:56:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats excessive
[1:56:26] maverick_4444: honored for first 2 then revered for the 70 dungeon
[1:56:38] MysticalOS: if you mean to get heroic key, it's revered at launch, honored later on
[1:57:16] Shambulence: which classic server are you on for Horde?
[1:57:47] xViewersunitedx: yeah 16 hours to hit 70
[1:57:48] Haximaxi: KEKWlaugh
[1:57:58] dalaraz: thats way incorrect
[1:57:59] xViewersunitedx: well 18 more likely
[1:58:05] maverick_4444: metagoblin said 1.5 bars per dungeon

[1:58:41] dalaraz: 60 to 70 through dungeons depends on the group gear

[2:00:50] swordwindgaming: Quest everywhere and you'll hit max in Netherstorm. No reason to skip the quest content either because of the rwards.
[2:00:54] justdavesadly: I can't tell if I want to play Ele Shaman or Shadow preist
[2:01:02] blwhzzrah: !song
[2:01:02] Holgrim93: more than 50 for sure
[2:01:05] blwhzzrah: !music
[2:01:09] Thoreya: 9.1 ptr today?
[2:01:09] blwhzzrah: whats that song??
[2:01:13] Mecabeast: Def noticed a drop off in retail player dungeon queues are getting longer so my alts are taking like 20% longer to get to 60.
[2:01:20] blwhzzrah: !sound
[2:01:21] Brodih_: as a priest, im happy that +healing/+spell stats no lonfer exists in TBC
[2:01:29] NovaSun84: 70 per day, or 70 per week?
[2:01:33] Caylex: does classic lvling gets easier when tbc releases?
[2:01:36] bruhSit_farmer: wow token price is like 155k
[2:01:37] bruhSit_farmer: wild
[2:01:38] xViewersunitedx: oh is it more then 50 now?
[2:01:43] xViewersunitedx: that was fast
[2:01:53] Ambersulfr: Anecdotally, I've had a lot harder a time getting queues than I have in modern WoW era.
[2:02:15] Ambersulfr: It applies to PVP and PVE.

[2:07:28] Lazugo: @Rhyskie120 Luxthos weak auras
[2:07:31] smashwow: it'll be good for about 2 months. the problem with 9.1 like most content creators have pointed out. is that we'll have been in 9.0 for roughly 6 months and it won't feel worth the wait on the amount of content we're getting.
[2:07:33] frostoshiro: wait achivement in classic o_O?
[2:07:36] ginsanop: @Towelliee do you think 9.1 will be just one more map with a rep farm ?

[2:13:52] BoofinZ: CHARLIE MURPHY
[2:13:53] Sandman_88: pathertic
[2:14:02] selvanera00: that's their plan isnt it- starve us completely of content so that we will be happy with lil crumbs :D
[2:14:13] bruhSit_farmer: lol selv true
[2:14:14] MysticalOS: i'm just tired of the retail and classic schedule conflicts. 9.1 ptr same week as tbc raid testing? they must really not want there to be good mod support for TBC
[2:14:15] smashwow: i mean if we aren't at least testing the new zone and mega dungeon i'd be a little disappointed.
[2:14:17] selvanera00: sarcasm ofc

[2:17:30] LittleLotta: lol
[2:17:32] brain_wash: Sarcasm requires Tone.... we killed it forever ago when we gave up face to face communication
[2:17:35] Mecabeast: you need mallet to get the carrot on a stick I think
[2:18:01] selvanera00: only one person jn the group needs mallet when going in zf
[2:18:06] bruhSit_farmer: i mean whining has been pretty common with sl among most people last couple of months

[2:18:25] smashwow: we've been whining about SL since the damn alpha.

[2:20:22] bruhSit_farmer: blizz breaking records

[2:20:32] CardinalTX: I log in to wow........and then i think.......why?     go play something else       currently trying ffxiv and some eso
[2:20:39] Ambersulfr: Gaps between raid tiers are bad, its difficult to keep a raid team together with nothing to do.
[2:20:39] carpentz0r: is the item level going to go up
[2:20:40] LittleLotta: true!
[2:20:45] mrpresbaby: Unless we have another pandemic it won't happen
[2:20:46] carpentz0r: or does it reset peoples gear or what
[2:20:47] luckfore: 9.1? LUL
[2:20:57] Astrocaine: only if we get a sequel to corona
[2:20:58] Ambersulfr: And if the raid is as good as Ulduar I won't mind, but it's not going to be.
[2:21:05] Mcfailadin: it does feel like it did after dragon soul waiting on mop
[2:21:08] RaidbossTV: scary

[2:21:54] 클라우센: 2 years of 9.3 HYPERS
[2:21:55] Ambersulfr: At this point "during a pandemic" is a tired excuse. If everyone else can work so can they.
[2:22:00] smashwow: we said it before. SL is the new WoD
[2:22:07] MysticalOS: @McfailadinEZ here is probelm with that, it's setup that TBC is gonna overlap with shadowlands content coming out, NOT the dry spell
[2:22:11] fistofnature: NotLikeThis i feel like they took this anima drought a little too serious NotLikeThis
[2:22:12] Fischkopfboy: maybe the put the drought in the beginning this time
[2:22:18] Redacted_: theyre just keeping it with the theme of the expansion, not enough to go around
[2:22:19] RaidbossTV: @Ambevsulfr imagine saying you can't work at your computer at work but having a 4k gaming pc at home
[2:22:20] selvanera00: maybe the jailer will be like "syyyke i was jk ill be a good boy" expansion over- going in the next one like wod
[2:22:23] MysticalOS: if tbc launched now it'd be great, but it's probably gonna launch same month as 9.1 at this rate
[2:22:32] Astrocaine: using the pandemic as an excuse is only acceptable to a certain point
[2:23:03] Ambersulfr: @Ambevsulfr yes! Not to mention it's normal for companies to just give you a PC... you can take it to your house.

[2:27:47] alundrius: ardenweild campaign hinted at the sharing of the night warrior power between people. i bet its the raid mechanic to beat sylvanas

[2:27:58] daniel8129: shes like the new illidan

[2:28:13] BattleKnoedel: maybe elune zone with tyrande as 9.2 raid boss
[2:28:15] NovaSun84: reflecting on Retail... I haven't even gotten AOTC and I'm fine with it.  It felt super heavy on FOMO this xpac
[2:28:15] Ldysansa: A Exorcism is coming for her
[2:28:36] PadidinJones: Cuz shes broken and going to explode?
[2:28:46] gidgeet: The Night warrior might be protecting her from that
[2:28:47] lumaday: He could use Sylvanas as bait later on
[2:28:49] CardinalTX: Who would have thought that the devs at ZoS are doing more that Blizz
[2:29:02] Dalsonson: Elune is a being of light, the Jailor is a being of darkness?
[2:29:10] BoofinZ: She cant be a vessel for destrunction the night warrior is vesseled in there
[2:29:18] Dalsonson: Maybe that’s why he’s hesitant to control Tyrande?
[2:29:19] Putcride: @towelliee what I am curious is why is hey
[2:29:24] MysticalOS: arthas and anduin were both commanders of the light, which jailer needs. a person of the light turned dark. tyrande is already filled with darkness
[2:29:30] Putcride: Hey lady there^

[2:29:32] CritcobainTV: dark side of the moon FeelsGoodMan
[2:29:38] bruhSit_farmer: looking back at 8.3 i hope they do something similar, re-using old zones with cool grinds/collectibles
[2:29:39] PadidinJones: Elune has a darkside.
[2:29:49] Putcride: Heyla*
[2:29:50] alundrius: a bipolar god, nice
[2:29:54] drewetling: see you on the darkside of the moon
[2:29:56] madmike8: That b*ich is dark.
[2:30:24] MysticalOS: @hjo1992 that'd be smart play to be honest. it's less work to recycle an old zone than make a new one, and it gets content out faster. it's kinda shortcut blizz needs to take right now.
[2:30:34] Asazull: have they released a day for pre patch yet
[2:30:49] SonofHorus82: While I think it would be cool to have the next xpac be the time skip and the light having taken over Azeroth, but I'm tired of seeing all my light user boys go bad.
[2:30:52] PadidinJones: I mean we have killed na'aru in Legion, were still heelin woons, trees burnt, and anduin is cucked

[2:31:25] BoofinZ: Thats a loe magni is the most strongest lull
[2:31:27] madmike8: Elune is a dreadlord disquised as a void lord.
[2:31:28] alundrius: =D
[2:31:31] 클라우센: pikaOMG

[2:38:01] Sandman_88: @Tacoma64 Great, not going to be locked out of quest progressing. You'll be scaled down for some dungeons to give ya good challenge.
[2:38:18] Mecabeast: I just hope they only bump the ilvl by like 10 and not by 30
[2:38:49] NovaSun84: not grabbing the second skull?
[2:38:52] SonofHorus82: @Heekss not yet. The most we know is that there was a datamined date of May 18th as the possible prepatch date, but that is not confirmed.

[3:20:31] zechetto: nah, con the controller you have 6 actual buttons for skills
[3:20:46] D3m0nHunt3r666: and Switch

[3:21:50] biggiemcg33: Hi @Towelliee why you in the dark?
[3:21:51] MuttonChopins: I heard D3 on switch is much more funner to play
[3:22:05] grizzlyhorn: people have said that its going to ruin the game when people map controller inputs to keybind macros on pc and can use more than 2 abilities
[3:22:12] crawcook: I liked the first few playthroughs on D2, I never got into the late game grind  like some people did. lol
[3:22:18] SilkeySmooth: I'd rather play diablo 3 then a game I beat decades ago

[3:59:25] GiraffeHydra_: @TheOGMed that seems like a terrible idea lol, God help the person if they don't know things like "make sure there are no bubbles when you inject"
[3:59:40] smashwow: even then if you do TRT, make sure they're watching your cortisol levels. that can counter-act the TRT
[3:59:48] snakeheatn: trt is a lifesaver man, 5 weeks in myself, do the injections yourself if possible

[5:19:43] Utmost777: i think people need to be realistic about what content they can do with the time they can put into the game. I can't invest time to get a 2k rio so I know I won't be doing 15+ keys. simple as that
[5:19:49] ms_enyo: Wish IO was the same as IQ
[5:20:00] ZeeBone117: if gear was harder to get then io wouldn't be relevant
[5:20:21] Quimby54: @ZeeBone117 elaborate
[5:20:22] Teitanblood: Looking at raid when inviting for dungeons is kinda weird though. I never do that.
[5:20:33] vyjinx: @UtmostOwnage all 15s is like 1,3k rio
[5:20:48] Utmost777: @vyjinx oh lol shows you how much I know about io
[5:20:57] D3m0nHunt3r666: no kyrian towRip towF
[5:20:58] ZeeBone117: @Quimby54 anyone can be 226 right now, from buying one 14 key a week and getting lucky
[5:21:26] thiccsushi: @UtmostOwnage 15s are easy to do once you get like 210+ ilvl and a legendary
[5:21:50] Quimby54: @ZeeBone117 and it's very easy to spot those people being boosted with a little effort
[5:22:34] thiccsushi: People boosted to that ilvl have very low amount of dungeons run vs someone who got it organically its easy to spot
[5:22:34] ZeeBone117: how? they'd be 1300 io
[5:22:39] Jarlan23: i really didnt do any m+ this week. explosive is absolute hell in pugs
[5:22:48] Enigmio: what lego u rocking?
[5:23:13] ZeeBone117: 14-15 gear slots is 14-15 weeks of getting 226 loot from the vault - it's not likely but possible
[5:23:41] Ballavar: just did PF - 2 cloaks.
[5:23:45] Jarlan23: how much gold is a 14 anyway
[5:23:54] Jarlan23: if you were to buy a run
[5:23:59] thiccsushi: its cheap now its like 160-180k
[5:24:11] Jarlan23: tf its not that cheap
[5:24:19] gauren999: m+14 on sylvanas is 125k

[6:04:02] elbinn: I thought Archimonde was one of the longest unkilled bosses that was up so I thought the raid as a whole might have been rough.
[6:04:09] Masqerader: then u waste 40 tps body running back to boss who killed u like 30 times on hell mode to kill baal
[6:04:19] redxxleaf: i assume they will have the orginal uber boss's to fight
[6:04:31] redxxleaf: original*
[6:04:58] gabizaoluz: does PTR starts today?
[6:04:59] cineris_3: archimonde was technically in the game at release hence the longest time unkilled
[6:05:03] Mecabeast: part of how long it took to kill archimonde was because the raid was available at launch
[6:05:30] Masqerader: compared to mu'ru he was a bitch, then again all bosses to mu'ru were bitches un nerfed
[6:06:03] EggwithEdges: Weren't T5 raids extremly buggy too?
[6:06:17] elbinn: I think that's still the coolest part of BC - it was basically all there just waiting for you to get to them. No pacing plan or anything.
[6:06:32] Jarlan23: i loved tbc. im afraid to go back to it though because i know itll just be like classic meta shit though
[6:06:49] psycho_scythe: I’m using the twitch app on my lunch break on my phone and for some reason I can’t see stream? It’s just audio only? Anyone know how to get stream back?

[6:26:50] ピンドロール: they made a raid around nier in ff14 yes
[6:26:52] BrutalHermit: Its another Square game so they like to do cross overs
[6:26:54] BLACKFOOT_TN: Anything can be related with Asian style MMOs lol.
[6:26:56] ピンドロール: that's been then 24man raid this expansion
[6:27:01] mab_music_ttrpg: I told my guild to try ffxiv half of them went  to kill time and no one wants to come back now. we have to go into recruitment for 9.1 XD
[6:27:08] CrunkyBrewster: Imagine if WoW did that with Overwatch or Diablo
[6:27:11] thiccsushi: they do cross overs and yoshi p has been wanting to do one with wow for awhile

[6:27:55] mab_music_ttrpg: @TheUnknowing  nah, they were not happy with shadowland anyway and it shows in M raiding prog.
[6:27:56] Avinar: @zodd_amhai most people I know actually don't care for nier raid tbh lol I see very few actually hyped for it unless they are huge nier fans. even the nier fans I know find the story kinda mixed for it but like the references
[6:28:05] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah fuck it, just combine WoW and ffxiv LUL

[6:28:43] Noshpan: @xXSiebzehnXx Yoshi-p totally wouldn't mind. I think he even mentioned that he would love to do a FF14-WoW crossover

[6:29:23] thiccsushi: I really liked this expacs story for ff14
[6:29:24] onyx_pupper: be kinda cooler if wow did it similar to runescape in the sense you can spam try for items and stuff but drop rates are really high
[6:29:25] Sathalan: the shadowbringers story is worth going all the way through imo

[6:36:57] WeedIsMySin__: some weeb shit
[6:37:21] BLACKFOOT_TN: New World will probably be the new Wildstar. Lots of Hype. Even more disappointment.
[6:37:33] WeedIsMySin__: I wish i could watch anime, literally infinite content
[6:37:39] WeedIsMySin__: cant take the shit seriously though

[6:38:27] Alacod: @lekkahdh tried to be wow classic
[6:38:31] mab_music_ttrpg: loved my engineer
[6:38:32] dreamjag: 40 man raids too hardcore
[6:38:37] Poriand: i hated leveling in Wildstar
[6:38:44] Kaihrn: AHhh yes the MIGHTY Reins of the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent poggerrrs
[6:38:44] Dunnoe: WoW is WoW.. simply as that
[6:38:45] ClockworkZen: neglected casuals in the end game, died a slow death
[6:38:48] Jesperoni: @WeedIsMySin1 you watch 1997 berserk? that's the real shit
[6:38:50] xXSiebzehnXx: Gotta have it all to survive, plus backing of streamers and good marketing
[6:38:51] Avinar: 2 of towelliees favorite mmos that never succeeded. swtor and wildstar
[6:38:54] lekkahdh: @lekkahdh What you mean... ?
[6:38:59] gurnt4: wildstar BibleThump
[6:39:01] Bacon_21: after a while it was knocked down to 20 man
[6:39:05] EggwithEdges: MMOs needs casual content to live
[6:39:08] xXSiebzehnXx: The landscape is evolving for games
[6:39:13] lekkahdh: "too hard? "  ahhhh....
[6:39:14] WeedIsMySin__: nah bro is it on netflix @Jesperoni
[6:39:24] Avinar: they also really didn't have much come out after the first 6 months.
[6:39:28] Poriand: housing in wildstar was amazing
[6:39:31] Jesperoni: idk it was on youtube when i watched it @WeedIsMySin1
[6:39:40] Alacod: you need casuals to survive they went straight hardcore.
[6:39:43] straightouttacontrol: yo mate, do u know how to disable the frame of the chat bubbles?
[6:39:47] Shrenko: why are you lvling a new monk @Towelliee ?
[6:39:53] TacoTime_Gaming: i miss engineer tanking in wildstar
[6:39:53] xXSiebzehnXx: Collectively not even half a brain? Oof
[6:39:56] Avinar: house in wildstar is what made me want housing in games
[6:39:58] Skullgrinx: It had bugs since beta never fixed. it had lag that was never dealt with. they never changed beta combat style which got boring and stall real fast especially warrior animation.
[6:39:59] Poriand: WoW needs housing
[6:40:01] jamarky23: best housing system in an mmo ever hands down
[6:40:01] clinch33: I wish Blizzard didn't rush LUL
[6:40:02] SicDogg: i dont get the point of housing ?
[6:40:07] Ezekyler: Blizzard sacrificed Draenor just to kill Wildstar, these bastards KEKW
[6:40:08] Shrenko: oh its Oondasta time towUnforch
[6:40:11] SpoonManes: why did wildstar die?
[6:40:11] CyonDru: what is this, Tarkov?
[6:40:12] BLACKFOOT_TN: Housing was the only thing I liked to be honest. Like REALLY liked.
[6:40:13] Skullgrinx: Wildstar housing was so beyond great!!!
[6:40:18] WeedIsMySin__: @Shrenko how do u get that eso badge????

[6:40:37] WeedIsMySin__: @Jesperoni aight
[6:40:39] Shrenko: @WeedIsMySin1 you cant get it anymore =/
[6:40:47] Skullgrinx: I made a hoverboard park in my housing.
[6:40:49] wargrim73: Unlike WOW on PVP gear and grindy dungeon gear..
[6:40:50] Alacod: @SicDogg then it wasn't meant for you.. there is a huge market for it.
[6:41:02] WeedIsMySin__: Shame, i got into ESO a few weeks ago. Best MMO i've ever played by far.
[6:41:07] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: A OMEGALUL C
[6:41:08] Avinar: ashes I feel won't really have raids intact and their combat looks... janky
[6:41:12] SicDogg: @Alacod ye ?
[6:41:13] mmrghost7: riot mmo can actually compete with wow , they got the money
[6:41:14] CrunkyBrewster: is Ashes of Creation like the Everquest inspired one they've been working on for years?
[6:41:15] Murphybrown: pantheon
[6:41:18] Mostdangspy: What about Pantheon if it does come out?
[6:41:27] codedizle: pantheon is a niche mmo not for everyone
[6:41:29] CrunkyBrewster: Oh no nevermind that Pantheon thank you
[6:41:30] TacoTime_Gaming: New World is coming along nicely
[6:41:31] usse00: Hey Towellie I do really enjoy tanking however I feel like I am struggling with hugher m+ keys being to stressful etc. Do you have any advice on how to become a better and more confidedent tank slootLove
[6:41:37] othraerir: any oceanic servers?
[6:41:50] BLACKFOOT_TN: I wont get Hyped for Ashes or ANY MMO until I see it being played by people on Twitch. Anything Devs put out is just taken with a grain of salt till I see the actual product.
[6:41:55] jamarky23: i agree with thhat guy the combat will be their downfall if they dont change it
[6:41:55] Clipstar: Riot mmo?
[6:41:56] Avinar: I really don't think pantheon will get the traction it needs to really gain much grounds.
[6:42:07] Enigmio: launching a MMO nowadays, needs to be full fletched and content patches planned/finished ahead
[6:42:10] feherlofia123: i was surprised to hear theres no auto attack in ashes
[6:42:11] TacoTime_Gaming: LoL mmo is coming at some point
[6:42:28] SpoonManes: git gud

[6:45:35] andre_j2: what zone are you in?
[6:45:45] TacoTime_Gaming: I have stopped getting excited for mmos the day wildstar died
[6:45:58] Collected1: ugh

[6:46:05] Kahoolo: Like Star Citizen lol
[6:46:05] angmar95: wtf
[6:46:07] WeedIsMySin__: Ohhh thats not smart

[6:46:37] SicDogg: @Alacod ok ty
[6:46:42] BLACKFOOT_TN: Gotta make all that money before the game probably fails. So they are StarCitizening the fans.
[6:46:49] Bladestorms701: Wait 400$ jesus
[6:46:50] WeedIsMySin__: @Eggy_Z Right? lmfao
[6:46:58] jamarky23: @TheUnknowing  Big true
[6:47:03] feherlofia123: ashes has no box fee tho
[6:47:06] Zenfar_: you don't need to buy those packs thou. its sub on release only with no box cost
[6:47:07] lekkahdh: 400 dollars macandspivNotLikeThis
[6:47:22] Creyd: @Towelliee do you think 25 is too much for race change I think its way too much if u think about u also have to sub
[6:47:26] Avinar: at least it's not an entire scam like chronicles of Elyria Kappa
[6:47:27] Kaihrn: whats that for?

[6:51:59] Kaihrn: The Jebait sparkle ><
[6:51:59] rocthenite: ashes have a CP2077 vibe to it imo, game in development for a long time people already spend hundred on a concept, insane fanboys, devs marketing themselves as "one of the boys"
[6:52:02] Sunflame666: that number scares the shit out of me
[6:52:10] othraerir: once a week @misshotmore
[6:52:40] misshotmore: Thanks @othraerir
[6:53:36] realiteegaming: ashes looks aight

[6:53:52] lithium364: atleast ashes will come out before star citizen lol
[6:54:05] othraerir: the node system in ashes sounds really good, will have to see how it pans out

[6:57:54] Smashbrother: I have been disconnected from digital world the past few days. Any word on 9.1 PTR?
[6:57:58] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee Ashes of Creation is not going to be successful. It appeals way too much into the hardcore players and absolutely nothing to the casual player or solo player.
[6:58:03] guni1980: Is the Sponsored Outrider Stream today?

[6:59:40] onyx_pupper: im sure they will pressure test nodes for volume

[7:03:34] Bixster: its one of these things that look great on paper, but as soon as you think about it
[7:03:41] metavahn231: rather just wait for ashes of creation
[7:04:10] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee Whether people want to admit or not a large percentage of MMO players play alone and people might not agree how it was done but WoW adapted to that. AShes doesnt seem to take that into consideration
[7:04:33] N3llee: @tamsantos321 sounds like MMO's arent for those players
[7:04:58] DMordak: I'm looking for a more PvE oriented MMO, so when these new interesting MMOs come forth and are mostly talking about PvP... which just kills any interest in even trying it.
[7:05:11] N3llee: I'm ok with those players not likeing an MMO
[7:05:23] happybooger: id agree with that

[7:05:24] WSquiggle12: Thats what I do
[7:05:43] N3llee: Yep let those solo players go play something else
[7:05:46] metavahn231: mmos are just single player games with opt in multiplayer, not like old days pure communities
[7:05:51] TMMOOF: Does "by yourself" count as queing for bg's solo? lol
[7:05:53] myamoray: probably some folks don't want to look foolish, and play alone to try to understand the gameplay!
[7:05:58] metavahn231: the true mmo died long ago
[7:06:03] ArcaneSyntax: even classic wow was extremely solo friendly for it's time @towelliee
[7:06:09] lithium364: compare to WoD not bad Kappa
[7:06:24] N3llee: Not the gaem Stephen is building
[7:06:31] ahla03: @Towelliee how is warrior in tbc ?
[7:06:41] chrisknight27: that doesn't hold much merit when there is like 3 major mmos
[7:06:41] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee BDO does an amazing job at solo experience
[7:06:54] A_New_Challenger: A_New_Challenger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! We coulda been friends...used to pocket heal back in BC :)
[7:06:57] N3llee: Stephen is building a certain kind of game... and being a certain kind of game may not appeal to everyone
[7:06:59] feherlofia123: isnt ashes supposed be drawing inspiration from everquest and archeage
[7:07:01] Lethal_Nax: mmo's need an evolution and players need to be willing to let it evolve
[7:07:10] Kahoolo: With all of the class possibilities, I worry that classes are going to lack depth in Ashes
[7:07:13] GoobleGamingTV: There will be alot of druid tanks in BC thats for sure
[7:07:20] A_New_Challenger: Thanks for the stream! Appreciate you!
[7:07:38] TheLoneRanger2016: @Towelliee where did all your cool background gear go?
[7:07:41] DemonicGrizz: DemonicGrizz is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel! 
[7:07:42] DemonicGrizz: DemonicGrizz gifted a Tier 1 sub to shogon! 
[7:07:43] N3llee: @feherlofia123 yes and no. Stephen played those games in his youth and those games have inspired him to make Ashes
[7:07:47] realiteegaming: I think in the end nodes will be pretty simple, still kinda cool though
[7:07:51] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee If BDO was subscription based and had no pay to win it would absolutely be the best MMO
[7:07:52] alex12645: warrior tbc was like you have to know what your doing
[7:07:54] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee you see that shit where apparently private servers got the BS 1h hammers wrong and apparently they arent bis anymore lmao
[7:08:01] LunarBrigade: Warrior in fury, arms, and Prot is still a great class in TBC... but it ain't king, or anywhere close to king, like in endgame Vanilla
[7:08:10] N3llee: @ArcaneSyntax they are for some classes
[7:08:10] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:08:29] myamoray: I think that human nature being what it is, some folks are always going to find something to complain about...the rest will adapt and find something to enjoy in any game, or stop playing it.
[7:08:35] shogon: @DemonicGrizz Thanks for the gift sub!
[7:08:35] onyx_pupper: im still stuck soloing in classic cause i just started and its pretty terrible and finding a guild is impossible
[7:08:39] ArcaneSyntax: @n3llee not for warriors or shaman anymore.
[7:08:42] TacoTime_Gaming: i am switching to sl/sl lock
[7:09:00] N3llee: @ArcaneSyntax you are incorrect on the Shaman part. Go read up on the recent discord info
[7:09:02] xXSiebzehnXx: ANY game that comes out now is gonna get sweaty nerded
[7:09:04] Zubberikan: is rarity saying it's a 34% drop?
[7:09:04] alex12645: rogues are good tho
[7:09:13] DemonicGrizz: @shogon no problem just pay if forward when you can
[7:09:18] N3llee: Before sharing incorrect info
[7:09:28] Catspaw66: so short story, if a shaman or warlock , bm hunter. you got a raid spot locked up .
[7:09:41] xXSiebzehnXx: Not until VR MMOs
[7:09:42] EggwithEdges: I'd play TBC HD all day every day
[7:09:45] LunarBrigade: If you honestly want to be the best of the best in TBC, you're going to wanna roll Lock or Hunter.
[7:09:59] hoodlife73: vr
[7:10:00] lithium364: i did enjoy bdo gameplay
[7:10:00] wise1k: I think theres a case to be made that the evolution has already happened and its games like destiny etc
[7:10:03] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee An MMO needs to value the gear you get and not dump it every few months/years
[7:10:09] Smashbrother: VR
[7:10:14] King_Ween: jetpacks... LUL
[7:10:41] DMordak: One thing with MMO's is being there early before early starting zones become empty and dead feeling.
[7:10:49] TheUnknowing: then you are stuck with the same gear forever with no upgrades, that doesn't make sense @tamsantos321
[7:10:50] xXSiebzehnXx: I would prefer that not to be the new MMORPG LUL
[7:10:52] realiteegaming: I like the arpg mmo idea
[7:10:54] Wildside1177: Destiny is not an MMO. It is a MO. It is not massivelly multiplayer at all.
[7:10:59] smashwow: i think wow has the right formula. just needs consistent content. maybe we just need a better story

[7:11:01] LunarBrigade: Lost Ark is quoted to finally be coming to NA via Amazon. Has me hyped.
[7:11:03] madhatterui: archage

[7:11:22] Wildside1177: Definitely not an MMO.
[7:11:26] BLACKFOOT_TN: Destiny 2 had really fun raids. They just need to expand upon classes and such. Destiny is great for just focused content.
[7:11:36] thrasnerv: To be fair, what classic brought to the table was true mmo, now it's fake mmo's with instanced group activities. Shame really..
[7:11:41] Poriand: I want to try lost ark
[7:11:46] EggwithEdges: Outriders is Diablo-shooter
[7:11:47] neverbornlucky: oculus quest will make vr mainstream
[7:11:55] Kyrrua: Lost ark is third most played game in korea rn
[7:12:03] Exodeo_: Isn't there this new Harry Potter game too?
[7:12:05] Streamcrush: lol all classic WoW was, was a casual version of Everquest
[7:12:08] realiteegaming: harry potter mmo
[7:12:11] xluckydawgx: @Towelliee Did you see LazyPeons video of Last Epoch
[7:12:11] xXSiebzehnXx: I liked the old LOTRO TBH
[7:12:15] LunarBrigade: @Exodeo_ It got chopped, will only be single player.
[7:12:20] alexmnt32: Mmo take many years to develop, we won’t see nothing special soon
[7:12:21] Exodeo_: meh
[7:12:33] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee Isn't Riot Games supposed to be producing a MMORPG
[7:12:37] xXSiebzehnXx: The FTP model was a bit janky but it was fun
[7:12:37] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:12:39] realiteegaming: just sayin they should make a harry potter mmo, that'd be sick
[7:12:43] othraerir: haha
[7:12:45] xXSiebzehnXx: Shit constantly felt dangerous
[7:12:49] Enigmio: haha
[7:12:58] onyx_pupper: riot pretty much just started hiring devs so not for like 5 years to see something
[7:13:08] PotbellyGoat: I want to play through MH Rise just because I enjoyed MW World
[7:13:09] neverbornlucky: snap dragon chipz and 5g will fuel vr stand alone
[7:13:17] apollobaker: who is he talking about?
[7:13:30] LunarBrigade: LazyPeon honestly never liked MMOs or games really, he was in it for the money, easy to tell.
[7:13:34] Bixster: isnt he making making money bitching about mmorpgs for like 8+ years?
[7:13:40] xXSiebzehnXx: I’m pretty positive when I get money too mhm YEP COCK
[7:13:40] cruzeal: towUnforch
[7:13:45] ArcaneSyntax: towUnforch
[7:13:49] Enigmio: i played lost ark on russian servers...its a fun game, looking good, combat is fine...but the endgame, chracter/item progression is complete dogshit
[7:13:51] x614x_engineer: POKEMON red version MMO
[7:13:52] SpoonManes: streamer is fake, no wayyy
[7:13:54] King_Ween: then you pretty much played monster hunter
[7:13:56] DemonicGrizz: towOof towOof towOof
[7:13:57] OreeoKenobi: isnt ff online really good now?
[7:14:03] Kahoolo: I want a US release of Dragon Quest 10 lol
[7:14:12] neverbornlucky: i am watching towelliee on a vr headset
[7:14:26] Bladestorms701: ff is ok
[7:14:33] LunarBrigade: @oreokenobii FF14 is really good, but it's not... extremely open. Follows the rules of mmos super closely, just very well balanced.
[7:14:37] realiteegaming: what video?
[7:14:38] codedizle: last epoch arpg does look pretty good
[7:14:38] myamoray: I thought that one of the ways they could evolve a game or at least continue it's longevity would be to ascend into another phase of the game...and start again at Ascended level 1, with different and stronger abilities etc. Same starting area, but phased or scaled as they can do now...just an idea
[7:14:38] ArcaneSyntax: towOof towUnforch
[7:14:44] DudeJoeyAwesome: i feel ya dawg
[7:14:48] MrGrimms: afternoo towelliee how was your weekened
[7:14:56] SpoonManes: lkike buh bye then

[7:15:00] Kawneee: just got here, who said that?
[7:15:05] SpoonManes: us mmo'ers aint going to miss him
[7:15:16] MrGrimms: heading out to the Bellagio this weekend
[7:15:26] ArcaneSyntax: i found 11 much smoother.
[7:15:31] Avinar: I mean he plays tons of mediocre mmos trying to find anything but he likes a certain kind of experience that none of them are giving so he's not feeling satisfied
[7:15:38] novlith: What's up with the nerfs on outriders?
[7:15:45] A_New_Challenger: I really enjoy hub city MMO's...PSO, MH, Destiny etc, but I don't really consider them the same type of game as ESO, FFXIV, or WOW
[7:15:49] ToadyMcToadFace: yo towel, why is the bed on the floor D:
[7:15:57] Kawneee: im finding dx12 to work really well now, way more fps too

[7:16:28] ToadyMcToadFace: Looks kinda like the bed you slept in for the classic release D:
[7:16:38] Tebbietv: your room is so empty atm since last I watched u what happed?:P
[7:16:41] Kyrrua: honestly I feel like new world and ashe are gonna fail, or at least clearly not meet the hype and will stay sustainable at best
[7:16:58] ArcaneSyntax: outriders needs transmog
[7:17:02] neverbornlucky: toweliee got booted from the bed
[7:17:03] xXSiebzehnXx: @kyrrua I think there’s too many fish in the pond
[7:17:09] Smashums: @Towelliee I was just at the Cosmo about 2 weeks ago, on monday/tuesday. People were pretty good about masks, wasn't too crazy. Felt decently comfortable
[7:17:22] xXSiebzehnXx: This little fish are gonna come in and most likely get dunked on
[7:17:30] Avinar: I think new world will become gw2. a solid game but nothing massive
[7:17:47] LunarBrigade: My only problem with Ashes, is they seem to want to break the mold, then get scared that they're breaking the mold, but still wanna break the mold. Lol
[7:17:47] A_New_Challenger: Can anyone tell me the big "Gotcha/Hook" for New World?...I am excited about it, but haven't dug enough to find out what it actually is
[7:17:49] Kyrrua: ye just sustainable but aint gonna be massive
[7:18:00] Wildside1177: Add hi on steam?
[7:18:00] Exodeo_: go to friends and there should be an add option
[7:18:06] SpoonManes: i have no friends :(
[7:18:08] Exodeo_: in the small menu top left
[7:18:30] Avinar: which is fine doesn't need to be the next wow or xiv population game to be successful. mmos are a niche now
[7:18:31] Exodeo_: The button is basically above the store one
[7:18:42] Kyrrua: moreover I fear for content for ashe for ex, if they don't do regular patches etc

[7:19:27] LunarBrigade: Yah it's a good game
[7:19:31] Avinar: xiv has a lot of hyper casuals who don't even really play the game just afk in cities and buy store outfits and dress up. so sub numbers don't matter tons
[7:20:13] LunarBrigade: Destiny 1 was way better than Destiny 2, never really got into Destiny 2.
