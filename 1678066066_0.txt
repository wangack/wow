[5:01:42] Dudutoolbox: 424
[5:01:55] Kunxion: @2860SPA 382
[5:02:27] TaraBellle: Its complete bs and you know it, there is no way they would cap conquest and allow that
[5:02:27] MetalexZero: not many people can
[5:02:30] B4dG3n3tix: what trophies?
[5:02:32] SilkeySmooth: no they didn't I'd bet
[5:02:34] Kunxion: yes they would expect that
[5:02:37] MisterThatDude: They disappeared on my server the Trophy's
[5:02:39] Kunxion: it would have been designed that way
[5:02:46] nwd_ow: do you need a new set of blue gear or can u use the ones you have
[5:02:52] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty

[5:03:04] sewer_creature: Thats what I will do, sell them first and then buy back if i need
[5:03:09] Capnrein: I sold mine so I can buy them back at a discount
[5:03:17] MisterThatDude: nope moon guard
[5:03:20] sanieldantos: i actually do think it was a screw up and they should soulbound, this type of quest rewards were never not soulbound
[5:03:22] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[5:03:45] modlost: @Kunxion and what ilvl do they get in bg/arena? :)
[5:03:46] BoricuaSJ: too much gold... tbh
[5:03:49] sewer_creature: I think their price will go up today Swifty, then they start to go down again
[5:03:50] Plockaren: I got a picture of you and me from 2014 Dreamhack Sweden  :D   Love to see it when i scroll around
[5:03:55] leswald: there is only 20 on my server
[5:03:58] Dudutoolbox: i dont see the point in doing conquest cap and then doing this
[5:04:01] Scyyny: @Swifty I was arguing with my gf if all the things around you are green screen and the moment you walked around, I became victorious 4Head
[5:04:19] Garther: hello Swifty, you look fantastic
[5:04:44] BoricuaSJ: lol someone just bought ALL the trppies in my server.
[5:04:45] leswald: some just bought all of them on my server
[5:05:05] Boops94: would have been a cool idea to get some extra pieces if it was bop, not bop just de-values conquest gear and makes it less fun getting your peice every week
[5:05:11] Dudutoolbox: are guardians finally nerfed?
[5:05:13] BoricuaSJ: and now selling them for 150k
[5:05:15] leswald: relisted them at 150k
[5:05:16] Nightsdragon: looks like trophies are bop now?
[5:05:20] Kunxion: you could buy them all out and resell at inflated cost
[5:05:21] BoricuaSJ: yup
[5:05:24] nwd_ow: yeah do you need another set of wm gear or can i use the current wm gear i have to buy it
[5:05:30] Capnrein: Ruins the fun that they are BOE
[5:05:41] sanieldantos: @Dudutoolbox also kinda invalidates the normal raid because it's only a 5 ilvl diffrence
[5:05:43] leswald: buy them for 70k repost for 150k
[5:05:45] BoricuaSJ: yup not going to buy them.
[5:05:49] Gelendrill: Dang, they are 200k on Tich
[5:05:56] BoricuaSJ: bleh.
[5:05:58] Scyyny: @Swifty I was arguing with my gf if all the things around you are green screen and the moment you walked around, I became victorious  4Head
[5:06:01] Kunxion: @leswald 250k
[5:06:12] Gelendrill: but they are showing on the AH as BoP

[5:07:09] xjesster: lol they are soulbound yea
[5:07:36] ItsHash: Real dragons PogChamp
[5:07:40] BoricuaSJ: Swifty, I think you caused a great disturbance in the AH force
