[0:27:40] m1cke90: I think it's proof that the devs aren't playing, or playing at very low lvls and can't see this will happen even though they are creating it

[0:29:48] alextheblight: you get one guy'd by the no-buzz andies
[0:29:48] flowerpew: pogg
[0:29:49] xhaven: what the "best" player in a game can do does not mean that the other 99.9% of players can even come close, yet you would nerf a class for everyone else because of what a few can do?
[0:29:50] ricey2121: go's on an off random
[0:29:50] retsdeew: f5 didnt help
[0:29:54] ibans: Please stop talking, the buss is ruining the video.

[0:30:10] flowerpew: better nerf hunter YEP
[0:30:11] Loth_nl: Seeing this, hunters must be nerfed asap
[0:30:13] feet_xo: blizzard devs must be happy their game didnt crash
[0:30:13] daijahaden: Not a fan of his moustache. Its unsettling.
[0:30:13] mayyoo__V3: peepoBurger
[0:30:23] Strathoos: Doesent drop lol. he spikes to 5% all the time
[0:30:24] wisdom_of_wombats: meanwhile hunters are 12 nerfs in kek
[0:30:24] Trexbo_: YEP
[0:30:28] Smooo07: fricc mages
[0:30:29] Smooo07: fricc hunters
[0:30:30] Hellacat: SKILL ISSUE he should feel bad
[0:30:30] flowerpew: YEP delete mages
[0:30:33] danbalanceltrist: too many new players discovering what the game is like pepeLaugh
[0:30:38] kable111: i remember when amphy started streaming now people make videos off his content. cool shit
[0:30:38] Nefenn: This is disgusting. Nerf Hunters
[0:30:38] Arthident: fricc mages
[0:30:39] foxxys856: mages doing this is fine and im not a mage there still not op in open world like hunters
[0:30:44] ricey2121: jokerd is doing it now
[0:30:48] viclund1: tbf mages shouldn't be able to face tank all of them, killing them isnt the issue just hte fact that they just face tank it isn't the way KEKW
[0:30:49] Rob970: @Nefenn KEKW
[0:31:03] petjii: LOL
[0:31:04] neuroxin: Who cares? Phase 1 is almost over
[0:31:06] Arthident: well guzu this argument isnt fair.. then you could also day "this is what hunter do, they deal tons of damage no need to nerf"
[0:31:09] petjii: He will be world first lvl 40 EASILY
[0:31:10] wonderwaffle407: mara was already a thing
[0:31:26] Hellacat: I dont think we should think about that guy's feelings at all. "It makes me feel bad" kek
[0:31:27] flowerpew: not far enough, delete hunter fricc
[0:31:33] Cetsha: yea but not face tanking
[0:31:37] Qelsar: what is warrior kit?
[0:31:42] jeussi: yeah but mages face tanking 200mobs is ridicilous
[0:31:42] richj_: Everytime people say "Mages have always done AOE" Yes but not with tanking and healing included.
[0:31:43] mediana91: he will only be able to get like 2 levels in WC
[0:31:44] DunderJoJo: as a rogue main, I'm quitting SoD if they nerf mage
[0:31:44] Trexbo_: YEP Fricc mages and fricc hunters
[0:31:44] m1cke90: @Arthident Hunters get extra targeted due to the strenght in pvp
[0:31:45] lukinss: he also spent a week learning how to do that pull efficiently I don‚Äôt see the issue
[0:31:48] Xezzive: then you need to nref locks becaus they can solo bosses in BFD
[0:32:00] twitchforgotmyaccount: @xhaven Whether it needs to be nerfed aside, I'm sure they could do something to nerf this particular strat without changing much for the 99.9%. This isn't exactly a normal use for the abilities.
[0:32:04] neugassh: Sod is a joke anyway so let the kids play
[0:32:04] Smooo07: but honestly the aoe part is the identity of the mage, its fine that they can do it but not facetank all those mobs
[0:32:09] nzcorona: its not game breaking though, exp doesnt matter past level cap, gold doesnt matter past a certain point. who cares if people are farming
[0:32:24] neuroxin: it's not hurting anyone so why care
[0:32:25] Smooo07: om
[0:32:26] Smooo07: HAHAHA
[0:32:27] Trexbo_: monkaW Slippery slope
[0:32:28] Mr_Moffert: aaaa
[0:32:28] wonderwaffle407: let them have fun its seasonal anyways

[0:32:53] wisdom_of_wombats: no, it was previously 125%

[0:33:20] HexyDaBawz: They just did, but they boosted hunter for phase 2, but nerfed them hard in phase 1
[0:33:22] rosendalddk: when you stop the video it is buzzing
[0:33:23] Ceodewd: Depends, Beast Mastery IS the pets domain
[0:33:25] roebinho7: no for beastmastery the pet should do the most
[0:33:26] rdecakapicaslo: if you are beast master the pet should  do it all
[0:33:28] danbalanceltrist: @Guzu well if you invest 3 runes and talents into your pet why wouldnt it be
[0:33:30] Smooo07: so make the pet the class
[0:33:32] Kazay1998: @Kazay1998 And then again. I don't think it's possible to balance anything at 25, classses are so different
[0:33:33] Guzumerchmanager: Yea i think a beastmaster pet should do 30-35% overall dmg, and a normal pet should do 15ish% @Guzu
[0:33:36] xhaven: Pet is Hunter though thats thier identity in classic
[0:33:47] Zergaa: Just make linked healthbar f√•r hunters pet and hunter and they can buff pet as muchs as they want in BM right :)
[0:33:49] Munkeeboy007: mm should be hunter 75/pet 25. and then bm should be like hunter 50/pet 50
[0:33:49] ramjack13: i mean hunters are only good at 25 because of the pet in that lvl
[0:33:50] Ceodewd: Smooo07 They have, its called druids :P
[0:33:52] nutty_wizard: shadow damage lupos bm spec
[0:34:03] wisdom_of_wombats: if i want to play a class with a useless pet ill go warlock
[0:34:05] neuroxin: am i insane, these looks like buffs not nerfs?
[0:34:06] flowerpew: hunters pets are already farming people in capital cities FeelsStrongMan

[0:34:11] Xezzive: if the pet is not doing most of the damage then what is the point of the BM spec?
[0:34:11] groyped: guzuComfy
[0:34:14] Smooo07: Ceodewd at this point the hunter is legit the pet tho, the weak aspect KEKL
[0:34:23] HexyDaBawz: back on top in phase 2
[0:34:23] Gloomi_x: good morning everyone !!
[0:34:23] jonquiereconnor: As a hunter main, I do declare: the nerfs are a-ok
[0:34:23] XDonTobi: peepoHey Guzu peepoHey  Chat WHere is the queen?
[0:34:26] notjernbane: this is a preventive meassure thats needed for p2
[0:34:29] alextheblight: video is using Oblivion music, by the way. I like it
[0:34:33] HexyDaBawz: or shadowpriest, will see
[0:34:38] Trexbo_: YEP
[0:34:44] alextheblight: yup
[0:34:46] DucktorLarsen: Lone Wolf you could make remove deadzone
[0:34:51] retsdeew: anybody else who had audio issues feels like its fixed now?
[0:34:55] rdecakapicaslo: hunter should only use eye of the beast and kill as pet...
[0:34:56] wonderwaffle407: HoTL is a dumb rune imo
[0:34:56] alextheblight: nerf hunters more
[0:34:57] fisker37: a few days ago i saw azamous soloing allis with his pet
[0:34:57] TakisC00: It's the weekly nerfs while other OP classes just kinda sit there. No disagreement the nerfs are needed in general.
[0:34:57] Kazay1998: @XDonTobi Think it's happening at 15:00
[0:34:59] nutty_wizard: weak no pet rune for pet class seems goofy
[0:35:01] pgm128: Says the OP shaman tank.....
[0:35:05] Zopum: ANd LOne wolf got nerfed fast as fuck too :p Went from 25% more dmg to 15% xD
[0:35:07] ben_mdlol: NO!!!
[0:35:08] flowerpew: that would be the worst idea ever
[0:35:11] tre___streck: only fun I had with hunter was the absurd damage, now the kit is just lame + low damage
[0:35:14] Mr_Moffert: guzuSmug make the deadzone LARGER
[0:35:15] Trexbo_: YEP It's op
[0:35:17] ben_mdlol: Deadzone makes the hunter playstyle fun
[0:35:18] Trexbo_: NOPERS
[0:35:22] oldmandinkleberg: lol what?
[0:35:23] Smooo07: shaman has insane thread
[0:35:27] northern__soul: no don‚Äôt remove pet
[0:35:27] notjernbane: in terms of dps, warrior tank is superior
[0:35:28] Qelsar: shaman tank is so far ahead of every other tank its insane
[0:35:30] Trexbo_: Tanks are so hard to keep threat on no?
[0:35:39] EddieLad: druid starsurge is stupid OP, unbelievable how many nerfs hunters have had and druid hasn't been touched really
[0:35:43] geennaamnl1: Boomkin is still very strong @Guzu They can delete you pretty ez ... but I still think they should nerf hunter , hunter is way to OP.
[0:35:47] AvengerDK: @wonderwaffle407 its so horde can get blessing of kings.
[0:35:57] Smooo07: hehe
[0:36:02] Syloa: hiii
[0:36:05] ben_mdlol: @EddieLad boomkin is fking shit lmao
[0:36:05] alextheblight: LUL
[0:36:07] Xezzive: they are doing the same thing now that they did in diabloIV changing spells base on how they performe on low lvl
[0:36:12] flowerpew: lone wolf is supposed to be used in raid not in pvp, without a deadzone hunters would be beat rogues in melee pvp
[0:36:14] TakisC00: A nerf a week
[0:36:14] zi0qt: Listen bois. Warriors and druid can constant pull throughout BFD. making the run 20mins. Shaman tanks OOM after every 2nd pull and has to sit and drink like a bitch making the run 40min long
[0:36:15] HighTerms: good
[0:36:16] PorryhatterTV: i didn't hear no bell
[0:36:16] Munkeeboy007: if rockbiter wasnt required to used taunt, it would be nice to be able to have wild strikes on shaman tanks
[0:36:17] HighTerms: fuck hunters
[0:36:19] geennaamnl1: Boomkin is still very strong @Guzu They can delete you pretty ez ... but I still think they should nerf hunter , hunter is way to OP
[0:36:19] die_toffi_fee: it feels so bad to be nerfed all the time...
[0:36:22] ashuraasura: WHINERS SUCK
[0:36:24] nutty_wizard: salty rerolls incoming
[0:36:26] kable111: they're trying to make MM viable at 40 even though BW will be in the game
[0:36:28] DucktorLarsen: Overall this is a 12% nerf to total Hunter dmg in PvE
[0:36:31] Gloomi_x: why not buff every other class so every class is op
[0:36:35] oldmandinkleberg: I wish for the last 3 days of phase one they revert all the nerfs for a little bit and let hunters roam free for a little while
[0:36:35] Syloa: WHERE IS THE WHEEL????
[0:36:37] danbalanceltrist: "compensate via the hunter's main spells" while they barely buff 2 worthless runes instead of revamping the rest of 5-6 runes which are simply unusable
[0:36:39] wonderwaffle407: @AvengerDK ah that makes sense ig
[0:36:43] Pepsuliini: hiii people
[0:36:47] Ceodewd: Syloa To his right
[0:36:51] flowerpew: Pepsuliini frenn
[0:36:54] PorryhatterTV: @Gloomi_x Powercreep in phase 1 FeelsGoodMan
[0:36:57] ashuraasura: hunters are supposed to be OP at lower levels tho
[0:36:59] Jarless: then change them the day of patch
[0:37:08] OzmoSlice: Hunter pets are literally 1vX'ing right now and MFs really in here trying to say they're in a good place LMAO
[0:37:08] Pepsuliini: @flowerpew peepoHug
[0:37:17] HexyDaBawz: ppl gotta learn that %boosts/nerfs dosnt do much for low lvl but will be much more noticeable higher lvl
[0:37:20] northern__soul: never
[0:37:21] Trexbo_: NODDERS Let's just remove runes for hunters
[0:37:24] flowerpew: not fair Saddies
[0:37:25] Mr_Moffert: deserved
[0:37:31] Trexbo_: YEP Fair Priests too broken
[0:37:34] Trexbo_: fricc Priests
[0:37:34] Mr_Moffert: you can still soloheal bfd
[0:37:36] Pepsuliini: Others are not even close
[0:37:40] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[0:37:41] Parshce: Yeah, we still feel good but it‚Äôs noticeable
[0:37:41] mediana91: this nerf hurt my soul so much
[0:37:42] alextheblight: paladin healing will be viable guzuBeliever
[0:37:48] Smooo07: Parshce hugg
[0:37:52] br0fest0r: Just base healing though, seems fine
[0:37:53] nzcorona: do you think this guy has a tunnel under new york
[0:37:55] ashuraasura: shammy is better aoe healing tho
[0:37:56] geennaamnl1: Shaman only has to stare to mobs to get threat , I cant do the same on my warrior tank SADGE
[0:37:59] TheJaycock: still you killed Savix Sadge
[0:38:00] Gloomi_x: boost up our druid healers :c
[0:38:03] DarkcrewCZ: yea, but its only viable priest spec
[0:38:11] neuroxin: it feels bad to nerf healing with shadow priest is fucking garbage tho
[0:38:14] jeussi: lol but priest is just staight healer class rn
[0:38:18] neuroxin: that's all priests got
[0:38:27] DemiG4: Priest allways was strong but with the runes more then before you can see that in wowlogs theyre almost 1.2 mill logged priests in SoD LUL
[0:38:28] Buenz: Hope 40 heal shaman will be GOOD
[0:38:28] alextheblight: Holy Radiance plz

[0:39:04] noisom1337: encouters will be easy then
[0:39:04] Mr_Moffert: @ashuraasura holy shock is a talent
[0:39:07] zi0qt: crazy powercreep then

[0:39:19] datguytsar: nod
[0:39:22] mediana91: you could upscale PVE content
[0:39:35] kable111: gomer would be easy af lol
[0:39:36] flowerpew: that would be based
[0:39:38] kable111: gnomer
[0:39:40] Mr_Moffert: priest healing wasnt an PVE only issue tho
[0:39:44] DarkcrewCZ: yea but in other hand, they should buff priest dps to be playable
[0:39:46] wolf79x: yeah imagine if they didnt nerf hunters 18 times
[0:39:46] Karntar: be doing retail dmg lol
[0:39:48] jawiti: wars are on a level of 60 preraid dps right now
[0:39:49] oldmandinkleberg: the game would turn into counterstrike where the first person to shoot gets the kill
[0:39:57] Dildozer68: this guy Clueless

[0:40:39] Overij: what if they just removed hunters guzuDink
[0:40:46] neuroxin: coronation is 15:00
[0:40:47] Gloomi_x: guzu where is the queen
[0:40:48] TakisC00: They are nerfing classes which can literally only do one role currently, hunter and priest. Whilst leaving classes that can fill multiple roles alone. A DPS hunter should do more damage than a Feral, since a druid can also do 3 other things.  A Priest should heal more than a resto, since a druid can also do 3 other things

[0:48:35] TRCloud: there is buzz but only on higher volume
[0:48:40] Blufootgaming: My idea for STV would be both sides trying to gain hakkars blessing by taking blood from enemy players like a Kill Confirmed game mode, then dropping the blood off at Hakkari altars. Once you get enough blood you take control of the altar, giving buffs to you but making you worth more blood give the other side a chance to steal it. Once you own all the altars, you win and get a zone wide 5% damage buff until the next battle.
[0:48:42] flowerpew: @Guzu sometimes it helps tightening all the audio cables on my audio interface when theres a buzz

[3:43:29] raiwist: warn him guzu
