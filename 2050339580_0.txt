[0:05:23] BigTrout3: KEKW
[0:05:44] leubinator: turning on maxs stream just to get yelled at by grom
[0:05:49] ThreesFG: Did they kill it?
[0:05:53] leubinator: ye they did
[0:06:09] Faollobo: asuh dude?
[0:06:11] Zacaree55: @Maximum You see the new Team Liquid focused AWC trailer yet? Its pretty sick.
[0:06:38] zathornwow: @Maximum You should get a low taper fade. Ninja got one
[0:06:56] wommy: MAX I LOVE YOUhi
[0:06:58] leubinator: xesevis team with the noheal rank 1 rise timetrial right now lets go

[0:09:08] Spiritcb: @maximum yo checkout the midnights announcement
[0:09:11] m1lkman10: Max check discord
[0:09:26] Kimolainen: dang it hate being european and it almost being midnight when you start haha
[0:09:27] leubinator: i want to see mandatory sub 11 min everbloom insane
[0:09:33] SparrowONE: I can't figure out what day it is when it's not in your title... confused.
[0:09:39] NerdRagedOut: ret is busted af
[0:09:43] Ahrmanhamma: Ret offhealing is kinda absurd, i love it
[0:09:45] MisterNioce: Hey
[0:10:03] Plague_GG: @maximum show yourself
[0:10:04] wolfman466: off not even the day in the title, must be pretty dry today
[0:10:05] Kimolainen: Growl did a double aug run :p was fun to watch
[0:10:18] Arisolo: @Maximum what in gods name happens in a 10:45 +23 EB
[0:10:37] Harleybane: was 3 pulls only
[0:10:45] MisterNioce: Nagura today was hating on Dev evokers (kinda jokingly obviously). Do you have any hot takes on Devastation?
[0:10:57] Riberson1: catsittingverycomfortablearoundacampfirewithitsfriends lets cook
[0:11:07] Arisolo: you have to imagine they're doing the place in 4-5 pulls
[0:11:26] Arisolo: cant take tree out of zone anymore but i imagine first pull is in the tree area
[0:11:28] leubinator: i think i have seen at the most 3 devs the whole season
[0:11:29] logain_13: I'm surprised JB hasn't sounded off on the no healer keys yet
[0:11:32] MisterNioce: Not fresh out of chipotle though hopefully
[0:11:35] snarky03: Why is pres evoker D tier?
[0:11:39] Rendlaws: fine in raid and suck in mplus
[0:11:41] lightbringercl: dev is kinda blasting
[0:11:46] CrackedOrb: JB probably asleep
[0:11:57] honeychonker: Thing is now, every new spec will need to have auggie at least a wee bit in mind now
[0:11:59] Arisolo: @logain_13 there's a good chance its not a true no healer key. Xesevi probably heals tyr and then gets summoned back as ret
[0:12:02] fowltyy: Instead of dev evoker take, give us response to JB's take that moonkin bear form is fine cause other specs also have defensives that dont let them do damage (immunities)
[0:12:14] Plague_GG: pres design is goated
[0:12:21] spiffzap: poo woo
[0:12:25] the_great_simonator: @snarky03 no idea how powerful pres is compared to other healers, but it's a absolute pain in the ass to play IMO
[0:12:27] MisterNioce: Couldnt agree more. Also watching the animations on a new class makes me think MAge and such need visual reworks
[0:12:35] Rendlaws: all i want is to play dev but then my healer rage at me for not being able to paradox them
[0:12:44] Cowslapping: rip beandealerx
[0:12:48] Kimolainen: I love playing Big blossom build in Raids it feels so rewarding
[0:13:22] deviljin____: Are you planning on checking out Last Epoch on release?
[0:13:55] Paleee_: is elemental shaman the only spec we didnt see at all in the race?

[0:18:10] Dzor12: That is some iconic hate watching
[0:18:11] Milano___: First time I've ever see anyone consistently hate watching LUL It was great
[0:18:13] professor_cullman: sucks they killed it same day I found out about his hate stream
[0:18:18] heffdogga: I had fallen asleep and that dude woke me up so quick
[0:18:20] addiiiiee: Gromnak is too funny

[0:19:41] Squats3: what are we eating
[0:19:42] ModestMewtwo21: @Maximum Can we watch teh Gromnack "no fuckin way thats a tank" clip
[0:19:42] stigotox: What do u think the nerfs of Fyrakk Mythic will be coming? as the Hall of Fame was closed today?

[0:27:57] littlegooaatt: @modestmewtwo21 vaxxed?
[0:27:57] itsCelivan: is that even a thing in retail anymore?
[0:28:22] Nickystr1x: you always gotta have the one officer that just rips “focus up guys” randomly and that’s it
[0:28:23] Wincrediboy: shouldn't officers just be the people who are committed to the guild?
[0:28:45] Watasumi23: hall of famed closed i dont see it  anywhere
[0:28:50] sundance_joe: or feared >:)
[0:29:05] Lrauq: mandatory unofficial role: vibe officer

[0:30:00] roguerhino: @Lrauq we actually have a vibe officer they are incharge of music in disc and also gambling during intermition

[0:31:20] rehyngaming: 20 shaks shouting "BOOM GET FLESHED ON" would be pretty dope
[0:31:24] chasen218: @Maximum  ok now the good question... if u had a chance to get 1 player or officer from Echo who will it be ?
[0:31:26] dango0n: 20 Gromnaks
[0:31:26] aescend_: 10 shaks 10 firedups
[0:31:26] nanerpus_: 20 drineys so you can big time them all

[0:31:40] thasthebear: 20 THDs
[0:31:44] gassygatinho: 20 thds = 20 potential wild tweets every day if they not happy with their class
[0:31:50] ModestMewtwo21: @Maximum 20 Shak's couldnt get anything done. One would hit the skip and they ALL would do it forever just feeding off eachother
[0:31:51] Nickystr1x: 20 shaks would win every race
[0:31:52] ubba90: 10 shaks 5 firedup and 5 avades best strat ever

[0:32:17] malnourish_: people skills are paramount even just for morale and energy
[0:32:21] Colin__TV: hey
[0:32:32] chasen218: @Maximum ok now the good question... if u had a chance to get 1 player or officer from Echo who will it be ?
[0:32:34] amyrlinn: i think it has less of an existential impact on the guild if it's smaller though
[0:32:35] skydollnoa: so riot release their latest bullshit. they shut down their card games
[0:32:41] 3V3R357: Would you swap sides with Scripe for next RWF? As in, you leading Echo and him leading Liquid... content for daysss
[0:32:44] crimsonwarcraft: For sure matters
[0:32:44] grimzero617: Like me, baby! It's power in the wrong hands, for sure
[0:32:45] zimnetv: Whats your thoughts on they play 1 tank 4 dps in mdi trials? @Maximum
[0:32:47] GressionSessions: my previous guild had an officer that drove the guild into the ground after the GM had RL stuff going on
[0:32:59] GressionSessions: insane power trip
[0:33:01] z0nkek: Hello ! What's your addon for the mount speed pls ?
[0:33:04] chasen218: @Maximum ok now the good question... if u had a chance to get 1 player or officer from Echo who will it be ??
[0:33:37] Rafi_DH: Yeh, we have officers that don’t even raid. they’re just friends of the GM. But, myself and other officers are   in the ‘Raid Leadership’ role. That’s the group that matters to us.
[0:33:41] leubinator: @Maximum there is a second team with aug now
[0:33:42] Firelord_Trolldemort: @Maximum how long did it take to get your average viewers from 3 to 75 when you first started streaming
[0:33:47] Spicy_Curryy: Spicy_Curryy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Yuh
[0:33:50] MBG_95: this was the same as TGP, are we sure Xesevi isnt just leaving after the first area and going Holy?
[0:33:55] basherbash32: You just want an officer that is the best and everybody be like them-Gor
[0:34:23] Wincrediboy: Do you think your bigger contribution as GM is the people management or the technical skill of raidleading?
[0:34:23] StanRaenslen: moad's team plays aug
[0:34:27] freppn: when is MDI

However, in raid, we have a group of officers that are designated ‘Raid Leadership.’ One of us is dedicated Raid Lead for callouts and explanations. The rest of us assist him with planning and strats.

[0:57:15] guynormally: SMOrc divine strom
[0:57:18] Jack_the_Dipper: Yeah we ret are LUL
[0:57:19] kakebuts: my only issue is it's a 10 minute video that takes a sentence to explain
[0:57:20] miraagex: based on my small experience, ret is either st or aoe, nothing inbetween
[0:57:31] Jacklolthebox: i was about to say he has been cooking
[0:57:32] guynormally: link?
[0:57:35] GrimFandango: Tettles is the goat this patch
[0:57:37] sheckles: boomkin gaslight ocming in hot
[0:57:37] leubinator: tettles on the sigma grindset
[0:57:40] blacklight_____: @miraagex not true after the buffs
[0:57:42] SeraphimSentinel: Padding is fine as long as the balance of prio and overall for the whole comp is good
[0:57:45] Squats3: hes been going hard on youtube since GG dropped their stuff
[0:57:46] ikaridlink: boomkin player
[0:57:47] AzzaHub: "This patch" lol the shade
[0:57:55] miraagex: @blacklight_____ haven't played this year, hope so!
[0:58:00] miraagex: ret*
[0:58:02] Ahrmanhamma: Ret prio is decent now. The FV buff helped
[0:58:12] miraagex: I see
[0:58:22] castlecastles: hi maxy mussy

[0:59:24] GrimFandango: @BigTrout3 i know dude it's so Sadge , I hate outlaw and sub
[0:59:28] sheckles: @Yagr6 these are stats based fire being bis hard surpresses frost mage
[0:59:28] dango0n: @Yagr6 sadly the high mages are on fire
[0:59:30] Aspire121: @Yagr6 it's just autogenerated based on keys timed so it's skewed af cuz all mages are playing fire
[0:59:44] lazy_marathoner: i just got mah mother-f-ing axe and need to share, woo!
[0:59:45] Juanzary: @Yagr6 It`s not a tier list for how good or bad, its about how populare aswell and who is completing keys on subcreation
[0:59:46] SeraphimSentinel: @Yagr6 Its based on statistics, and all the mages swapped fire. So yes, its mega cap, but also accurate?
[0:59:50] Thar_C1: thar
[0:59:59] guynormally: outlaw damage is exactly the same as fire
[1:00:07] dango0n: Shadow priest
[1:00:43] Joneim: Ashen Catalyst + hot hands on big pulls is fun af, legit Lava lash every global
[1:00:54] fowltyy: good at not losing a ton in talents
[1:00:56] fowltyy: but no prio
[1:00:57] katarinatw: no
[1:00:57] blacklight_____: no
[1:00:58] SeraphimSentinel: No
[1:00:59] fowltyy: its either AOE or ST
[1:01:00] guynormally: almost none
[1:01:00] Diinklebeeerg: very little
[1:01:02] Xastin3: moonkin has no piro
[1:01:02] katarinatw: besides beam
[1:01:02] papach0ng: starsurge or moons
[1:01:03] Mazmerized: its basically ret
[1:01:12] Yagr6: ele can funnel
[1:01:13] cothxd: theyre good at dying
[1:01:16] Xastin3: moonkin and ret are no prio
[1:01:20] holmat: starfall og starsurge is pretty much like ret
[1:01:35] papach0ng: Ele and enhance can both funnel
[1:01:40] LuciFeariUm: You have good st and good aoe in the same build but you can only do aoe or st in a given rotation
[1:01:43] drchemtutor: Ele on second boss of everbloom is absolutely INSANE
[1:01:47] blacklight_____: ele's damage is insane at 5-6 targets
[1:01:55] Xastin3: shaman is no invite class
[1:01:56] Ahrmanhamma: Ele cranks in keys, I just rarely see them
[1:01:56] SeraphimSentinel: Shaman is quite good but NO ONE is playing them
[1:02:02] lostamongliars: the amount of ST damage ele gains from any additional target is nuts
[1:02:10] shareandcare: so what about enhance then?
[1:03:30] ArchausDEKAY: scavangers way worse
[1:03:37] blacklight_____: yeah he talks about that
[1:04:09] dango0n: Play enhance then
[1:04:14] dango0n: lol
[1:04:18] BigTrout3: enhance is so fun
[1:04:19] Yagr6: @SeraphimSentinel i pugged a 25 tott tyran on ele, some people play it
[1:04:20] Helo_KiX: I've been having fun with enhance this season
[1:04:24] bayazijr: Enhance is good but not big dopamine when you do tank dmg in big pulls
[1:04:27] needaccounttwitch: ive yet to see a good ele im interested to see now, would u try it max?
[1:04:37] Speedrun243: @Maximum did you see the time trials keys
[1:04:37] Voyburke: tournament realm lets you do this? no?
[1:04:38] M__Wolfe: I love Enhance so much but its so squishy comparably to my dk and ww
[1:04:41] Cebs131: you can, tourny realm
[1:04:51] Xastin3: gearing in s3 is awful. getting caught up is rough
[1:04:55] FrustratedFr0sty: just viewer raid
[1:04:56] larkhill: outlaw looks at these 10+ mob pulls and gets real sad
[1:04:58] Helo_KiX: @bayazijr yeah seeing everyone blast on first pull hurts so much but by the end of the key it feels good
[1:05:04] papach0ng: Enhance will never have the big aoe, and that's why people don't bring them, cause they think they're bad.
[1:05:04] rapiwow: Get me in boss i'm ready who needs sleep KEKW
[1:05:06] holmat: -800 crests
[1:05:09] just_ie: If only enhance had defensives so i can actually push keys without hating myself
[1:05:10] krasimark: @Xastin3 easiest of all seasons
[1:05:18] xen0phics: @xastin3 what lmao
[1:05:20] CptReymious: @Xastin3 no joke
[1:05:21] Fishbulb07: is there crest catchup at all?
[1:05:26] dango0n: I feel that. My priest needs 28 timed 16+ keys for aspects to max my gear
[1:05:29] FireHawkDown: Do you think double Blue Silken lining or Toxic Thorn boots+Decay patch is better on DH?
[1:05:35] xen0phics: this gearing system is the best one ever period
[1:05:48] Voyburke: The setup on the tournament realm was something that I was not expecting
[1:06:21] not_breadors: @dango0n in the Emerald Dream next to the gear upgrade vendor u can trade 15 purple crests for 15 yellow crests
[1:06:21] Dsully08: did max ever comment on tettles getting cooked by jb?
[1:06:23] Halt57: Gearing/ catching up is stupid easy rn. can get to 480 in like a week, two tops
[1:06:57] Aejique: @Halt57 brother you have to farm like 100 keys to get the crests to upgrade everything. it's not hard, it's tedious
[1:07:07] lostamongliars: 480 in a week if you do 50 dungeons in a week, sure
[1:07:40] Xastin3: 480 isnt caught up though
[1:07:40] chickenwormwave: 7 a day keeps yor wife away ;)
[1:07:46] Maximum: @Halt57 rather be in prison
[1:07:52] Xastin3: need be like 485 wich takes vaults or mythic
[1:07:55] Helo_KiX: KEKW
[1:08:14] reggiepowa: shitter mobs LUL
[1:08:22] FireHawkDown: Just buy a Liquid Mythic Raid boost
[1:08:23] gregoryvamosi: mhm!
[1:08:35] albunk: hey
[1:08:35] GressionSessions: Its honestly a huge reason I don't play an alt during prog, is the process of getting another character equally geared
[1:08:37] dango0n: those shitter mobs apply bursting... yikes
[1:09:03] Xastin3: bursting isnt that scary anymore
[1:09:19] kramer_1996: bursting is only scare if your healer is bad
[1:09:22] papach0ng: Bursting is a meme
[1:09:23] kramer_1996: scary
[1:09:24] dango0n: not true in pugs imo
[1:09:28] wiltsne: bursting is free affix rn
[1:09:30] papach0ng: @kramer_1996 This
[1:09:31] woobackjack: 20x
[1:09:33] Xastin3: 20
[1:09:34] BreauMeister: 30
[1:09:39] runejuicahhh: 20x
[1:09:40] Xastin3: sanguine just annoying
[1:09:44] Xastin3: its not scary
[1:09:45] Archerone: Yep
[1:09:45] notpadfoot: bursting in pugs is actually rerolling dps affix
[1:09:45] malnourish_: sanguine is piss now
[1:09:45] wolfsark: there are certain areas where you lose a lot of time to sanguine in certain dungeosn
[1:09:47] runejuicahhh: and annoying
[1:09:47] puremike78: 22.37x
[1:09:48] papach0ng: Bursting with a rdruid is a meme
[1:09:49] Subbed_No_Ban: day one sanguine was wild
[1:09:52] miraagex: a bit annoying in small corridor
[1:09:54] Kynaz01: Still annoying in WM/BRH like dungeons where space is limited
[1:09:54] miraagex: but ye
[1:09:55] nalegi07: as a frost mage fuck that affix
[1:10:00] nalegi07: ruins keys the whole week
[1:10:01] mandbyvgc: it needs to not heal bosses
[1:10:06] Voyburke: Its annoying, I also feel the same way about storming...
[1:10:10] Sekrai: Sanguine in WM is the worst when the witches just stand and cast
[1:10:13] wolfsark: sucks for destro too
[1:10:14] mybootyisasnack: whenever i play as an unholy dk its super annoying with all the movement that comes with it
[1:10:19] dango0n: do some enhance keys lol
[1:10:19] wiltsne: bolstering is the most bullshit affix
[1:10:26] MisterNioce: IM all in for you doing keys, teach me something
[1:10:27] Xastin3: but still big advocate of removing affixes
[1:10:31] zara1123: do some enhance keys
[1:10:32] wolfsark: sanguine in waycrest and black rook hold is pretty annoying
[1:10:33] Xastin3: cause they are annoying
[1:10:34] ChrisHimself: @Aejique I literally quit wow because of this. after 3 months I'd have to farm 100+ keys for EACH alt which is fucking dumb
[1:10:36] Juanzary: Is it a "Gain io" kinda day ?
[1:10:52] sim967: around 20ish keys, myself and my tank both outheal sanguine now
[1:11:01] peepofeelings: ENHANCE
[1:11:04] wolfsark: HACKERMANS enhance
[1:11:11] duel00: @Maximum do you think at this point in the season you should somehow be able to get myth tier items from m+ without vault?
[1:11:30] Gauner_: Like that guy who was looking at AI streamer nudes was exposed
[1:11:33] Yagr6: these classes that put dmg over time affects like EQ , and rain of fire during sanguine sucks, consecration too
[1:11:45] Maruika: i seen you watching amouranth on your second monitor when you alt tabbed once
[1:12:11] miraagex: mythic raid needs to be unlocked faster. first 2-4 bosses are usually piss
[1:12:11] wiltsne: i hate raid trinkets being used in  m+
[1:12:14] nyshindysheen: sounds like pvp gearing kekw
[1:12:19] dango0n: @Maruika KEKW exposed
[1:12:19] larkhill: my rogue alt waiting for a myth dagger endlessly
[1:12:20] Yagr6: @Maruika goes hard
[1:12:25] reggiepowa: somebody suggested titanforged gear in like 25 or higher keys, like you can get an item at myth track
[1:12:31] pork_pockets41: 12 merit tokens
[1:12:33] aama___: keys 25+ maybe?
[1:12:36] nalegi07: 90 is a weekly amount of crests I think that would be fair
[1:12:39] asd123qwerty1: better idea, use tokens from vault like 6 or 12 to upgrade end of dungeon loot to 489
[1:12:39] Guffels: @miraagex boss 2 is gunna be wild for pugs but 1 and 3 are jokes. idk if 4 is possible tho
[1:12:41] eggs_boiled: oh? i was supposed to single target the prio mob and let the mage ignite cleave the shitters down? Aghh darn i popped cds and topped the meter accidentaly BASED
[1:12:44] mybootyisasnack: theres actually a really easy way to remove the alt tab preview tabs
[1:12:50] nok_gg: keys 22 and above drop myth gear would be nice imo
[1:12:55] Cardenarcc: isn’t that what crafting pieces already do? @maximum
[1:12:59] nok_gg: some incentive to do above 20s
[1:12:59] Xastin3: i mean it feels like we should already be at that point. most people have 300-500 aspect crests laying around
[1:13:08] aama___: or 9-12 vault tokens sounds good
[1:13:12] miraagex: @Guffels currently, gnarl igira council voloc are memes. ladodar/nymue would smash pugs probably
[1:13:12] nyshindysheen: @Maximum so everyone on the turrny realm at all times?
[1:13:18] larkhill: cant craft a timestrike dagger
[1:13:36] Guffels: @miraagex no way a pug does council mythic. thats total bait
[1:13:36] Cardenarcc: right but you can craft a dagger
[1:13:40] Yagr6: bad luck protection for tokens would go hard
[1:13:45] Shikoroh: they enrage the dargon
[1:13:46] Mortalshare16: they buff the dragon when they die
[1:13:47] lostamongliars: they buff the dragon's melees
[1:13:47] nalegi07: nope
[1:13:48] bigmeanbeefy: AA the tank, thats it
[1:13:48] Pyrrha_GG: they buff the dragon
[1:13:49] discomancer1: they empower the dragon when they die
[1:13:49] reggiepowa: they chunk you
[1:13:50] Diinklebeeerg: they buff the dragon when they die
[1:13:51] guynormally: they auto the tank
[1:13:51] Kamehameshaw: hey
[1:13:52] wiltsne: boost the dragons aa or something
[1:13:52] Myusen: they apply a raging buff
[1:13:52] Joneim: They only buff im p sure
[1:13:52] Mortalshare16: so its actually better to not burst them
[1:13:52] aama___: they boost dragon tank damage
[1:13:55] Camelbak21: They increase dopamine
[1:13:55] Honeymunchz: They buff your pad
[1:13:56] cheezyyc: ellesmere had a similar idea but with skipping 2 vaults for an upgrade item
[1:14:11] reggiepowa: love to pull 1mil dps on chunks
[1:14:18] jandemain: chunks are amazing for mw healing
[1:14:23] l3aml3oo: u can soothe the enrage which is pretty nice, like shiv on rouge
[1:14:24] Myusen: @reggiepowa found the momnkey
[1:14:34] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa zug zug
[1:14:37] bareuheldig: i swear ret pallys need this video more than any other spec
[1:14:44] miraagex: @Guffels i see players refusing to be forced to be duck for clearing puddles coz they want to dps :D
[1:14:45] Xastin3: either attack most hp mob or most scry mob always
[1:14:45] Onyo1337: nah people in the 25-27 range are overall dmg lords
[1:14:46] Wincrediboy: as a casual tank player, I barely understand what 'damage profile' means
[1:14:52] nyshindysheen: people can NOT tell its awful lmao
[1:14:53] needaccounttwitch: in pugs overall dmg is king
[1:15:07] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm triHmm
[1:15:20] Myusen: @needaccounttwitch unironically true. no pug tank looks at boss dmg if they reinvite you xdxd
[1:15:25] ColdIceCreamMan: i want to pad! Madge
[1:15:27] Baskkov: I do that on lower keys :D
[1:15:29] hammond_nv: CAUGHT
[1:15:30] Scoops__: gorepally just sneezed
[1:15:32] eggs_boiled: someone has to kill them, might as well be me BASED
[1:15:35] HolmesRN: divine storm goes brr
[1:15:35] Denz_9: ret pally are suspect #1 when they divine storm chunks
[1:15:36] shareandcare: please let me zug zug in my random 20s on those chunks
[1:15:38] damnitmalf: “dps is dps” dorki 2024
[1:15:43] r_Flame: i do it cuz they will

[1:16:20] Guffels: @miraagex more concerned that all the dps who get forced into duck eat all the plants instead of timing out and you just wipe to pip every time
[1:16:21] Xastin3: prio
[1:16:25] notpadfoot: @Maximum Echo did a 23 everbloom under 12m with destro lock lol.

[1:17:46] miraagex: @Wincrediboy imagine "damage done" graph as a graph. if it's flat 200k dps, it's sustained profile. if it has 600k spikes every minute for 10sec and then 80k, its burst profile

[1:19:00] Xastin3: no healer keys are a great thing to see... its perfect example why dungeon balance is awful for healers. they need bring back attrition healing, Remove vers defensive bonus. Rebalance damage reductions, look at leech / avoidence. healer should have a roll in dungeons again.
[1:19:01] just_ie: As long as Spirit Wolf exist, then boomies are never allowed to complain @maximum

[1:23:04] IAmRhys1: @miraagex as in boomkin? going into bear for big hits of damage is completely fine and if anything is part of playing druid, having to perma shift into bear is borderline unplayable

[1:26:00] Guko97: how are dks not in the comp? unholy is good at mdi style pulls arent they? what changed @Maximum
[1:26:05] mattchewk: its also so fucking easy to play this way

[1:32:54] JaeDaddaa: or wrap around
[1:32:56] Ckraigfriend: first pull to second boss with 40%%trash
[1:33:03] Arisolo: @Maximum you want to get witherbark online as early as possible but your second pull has to contain a bunch of the mobs into witherbark
[1:33:05] Flying5hitz: i think they go council first
[1:33:11] Yagr6: is mdi this weekend
[1:33:11] BeardlessDwarff: @Maximum you can skip to the second boss without killing second with vdh

[1:34:08] SweitzTV: you can gate into 2nd boss from behind the house but its insta combat with council
[1:34:08] nok_gg: @Hopefulx CrazyIWasCrazyOnceTheyPutMeInARoomARubberroomARubberroomFilledWithRatsRatsMakeMeGoCrazy
[1:34:09] Raerdk: you must need to take the triple caster pack for from the 3rd boss with the 1st or second boss?
[1:34:10] leubinator: hopeful about to disband legendary
[1:34:11] Captain_matt: That's what I'd say if I knew Max was cooking up a bad route.
[1:34:15] Arisolo: you probably do more than 10 petals with boss. have to grab more
[1:34:23] xxmoonflowers30: :(

[1:40:46] Parametik: Big shakes
[1:40:48] 0_____Kappa: monkaHmm

[1:41:15] r_Flame: no
[1:41:16] BeardlessDwarff: MDI is speed not TGP
[1:41:18] r_Flame: we want fast
[1:41:19] othernewname: i hope MDI is 32+  or i quit wow
[1:41:21] Arisolo: no you want MDI keys to be 22s. thats what lets people cook the big strats
[1:41:21] alstadi: 25 is a big high for mdi, 23-24s seem bis
[1:41:24] chainpullz: i hope the actual MDI are 21s so they can do it in one pull Wokege
[1:41:26] Guffels: mdi needs to be fast af. anything hard is bad

[1:41:48] Rebizle: Max has the best take on this fuck watching them just slam into one mob for 20 more seconds
[1:41:55] lleguerre: Feel like 23 is good
[1:42:00] greenmachine11235: The only interesting part of mdi is the stupidity of pulls. Watching what would be faster live keys is boring
[1:42:02] surpriseparty20: MDI is who can break the game better and  I love it LUL
[1:42:03] breekicheeki9: 23 is perfect
[1:42:08] ghostfox888: 22-23 is very good
[1:42:08] LyusinatoR: 23s are the old 18s anyway
[1:42:10] LuciFeariUm: if they are doing 23s in 11 minutes i think 23 is perfect
[1:42:12] miraagex: @Olia_X weekly keys no leavers (doing 1 pull dungeon)
[1:42:14] Arisolo: does xesevi play aug? I feel liek thats better for no healer key than ret
[1:42:15] LyusinatoR: it was like that since we have MDI
[1:42:16] Captain_matt: they should have a +10 bracket just to see how fast we can get
[1:42:20] Cocotao: 17min is a good time for a run. Everbloom is an exception for sure
[1:42:22] ganshruber: both are cool. MDI has way more action but TGP is insane
[1:42:27] ghostfox888: when is MDI?

[1:47:29] Klutch81: why don't they stream the time trials, it's sorta a TGP
[1:47:32] Nocturne118: @Dritlukt they finished 2nd last mdi

[1:47:48] balthasar101: VDH on tourney servers but im currently working so RIP
[1:47:54] noewon: YEP delete healers
[1:48:09] lostamongliars: @miraagex that's gotta be the multiple hits within 0.2 seconds
[1:48:12] lleguerre: I think they are just no healing the start because you need healing for the last part i believe
[1:48:13] caveman2x: healers RIPBOZO
[1:48:14] minikori: wens 2 healer in tgp
[1:48:19] menzlo: Huh
[1:48:19] BeardlessDwarff: They are isane lol
[1:48:20] Arisolo: no healer is also usually a time trial thing. Much harder to consistently pulll in the cup
[1:48:26] mahz: Big Wizards
[1:48:27] AbieCherry: they lost to 9s last MDI
[1:48:27] othernewname: @Maximum whats ur take on  players watching LIVE MDI while  playing?
[1:48:28] Guffels: @Klutch81 too much tech would be exposed
[1:48:29] Dritlukt: yes but historically speaking havent perplexed been better
[1:48:35] Messi779: do you think they don't do the zerg strat for the council boss in eb, if they go no healer? swapping the boss around to kick small casts
[1:48:43] CrackedOrb: this is great, all of these specs gonna get nerfed into the round
[1:48:49] CrackedOrb: g
[1:48:52] Paleee_: @Maximum Are we sure it's no healer the whole key? It could be that they phased out at some point. Similar to the freehold last season
[1:48:54] Arisolo: last TGP they lost to last boss of VP. They were fine, just fucked up a tiny bit
[1:48:58] Klutch81: @Guffels I see it as, it makes it more competitive and fun
[1:49:00] shareandcare: would you try to recruit players based on their mdi performance?
[1:49:02] alstadi: Mandatory is quite new team still, think their first MDI together was the last one of shadowlands
[1:49:03] AbieCherry: @Maximum mandatory have a new player tho they got stove from sheesh
[1:49:06] Dritlukt: im probably misremembering
[1:49:15] roguerhino: @Paleee_ you cant phase out in MDI/tourny realm
[1:49:15] Guffels: @Guffels fun is irrelevant if it causes you to lose

[1:49:33] muonz: stove is great
[1:49:34] Arisolo: @roguerhino thats not true
[1:49:39] Paleee_: @Paleee_ Didn't they phase out on freehold last season?
[1:49:43] Arisolo: you can zone out if you have a lock
[1:49:51] Klutch81: @Guffels If you can't adapt then you don't deserve it anyways
[1:49:51] treesdesu: Sounds hot
[1:49:52] CrackedOrb: Grill

[1:50:17] whiskeyhide: nah they arent
[1:50:22] burne114: andy and thaner
[1:50:24] Guffels: @Guffels lol thats the worst take of all time. would be like telling a pro sports team that if they dont publish their play book they are bad
[1:50:26] professor_cullman: where's team Dorku
[1:50:26] whiskeyhide: its andy thaner wildi speed and fraggo
[1:50:27] hyrrokin123: ambition gave up already
[1:50:28] AbieCherry: Andy/thaner/Stove/Speed & Wildi @Maximum
[1:50:34] unexpected070: Andy said they're skipping MDI but looking at TGP next season
[1:50:34] zlncy: @Klutch81 I'd argue if you aren't competing, your take on "but it'd be fun" wouldn't translate.
[1:50:50] alstadi: I'm pretty sure they are competing, Fraggo was on Echo podcast and said they were going to
[1:50:54] hyrrokin123: Thaner team will not compete. They already called it. Ambition is broken since SL.
[1:50:55] baconic12: wassup maxi max max
[1:50:58] jrapp106: @maximum you should look at how big the awc bracket is in size compared to the web page it's on.
[1:51:09] Dante20404: true
[1:51:09] nok_gg: I mean ambition isnt even doing mdi
[1:51:13] weezie_61: Ambition almost won MDI, 3rd place

[1:52:00] logicaltty: KEKW
[1:52:03] Tanonn: bye bye
[1:52:04] dcailor4: ambition showed up to their first MDI in Shadow lands and took 3rd and then dipped
[1:52:04] Klutch81: @zlncy Do you watch sports? Teams have to shift strats every single game
[1:52:06] afkpoopn: that is a mega bracket
[1:52:06] sorliee: OMEGALUL
[1:52:14] gregtehcow: sus design

[1:52:46] tatertotpauls: video on pika channel going against liquid guys
[1:52:46] klondike_wow: the move EZ
[1:52:53] zlncy: @Klutch81 sure, however, unlike football, you are fighting NPCs which have set patterns & mechanics, there's no "spontaneous adaptation" to outplay another team like say PVP.

[1:53:50] AbieCherry: sub 15 rise 100%

[1:54:01] the_great_simonator: Im gonna say sub 10 EB, but higher than 9 minute
[1:54:14] savagefoxx: Holy smokes those nanoleaf lights are turbo expensive!
[1:54:15] soddalele: isnt there like atleast 5 minutes in unavoidable RP in rise?
[1:54:16] Camelbak21: I mean, you have to do the math, but it's probably hard capped cause of the RP and reunning
[1:54:23] minikori: what is the fastest MDI dungeon ever? is it RLP/EB?
[1:54:25] relimee0: yes
[1:54:34] weezie_61: you cant pull any bigger in Rise to go fatser tho so how does healer help? it is first boss trash and thatr is all
[1:54:48] Rafi_DH: Will there be a sub 15 Rise at some point in the tourney?
[1:54:53] AbieCherry: it will always show if you complete a run
[1:55:15] Ruinx81: Where’s Dork
[1:55:17] lleguerre: If the run is not good they just don't finish it
[1:55:17] Klutch81: @zlncy Fair point, we'll see the strats during MDI anyways but idk just adds the reasons TGP is wayyyy better for viewers
[1:55:21] Mattefofan: click the timer
[1:55:23] minikori: echo has sandbagged time trials in the past right
[1:55:27] strikeofzeus: strikeofzeus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 3 month streak! yippie
[1:55:30] Mattefofan: it shows all runs
[1:55:32] castlecastles: wheres the dork man?
[1:55:38] AbieCherry: echo did their time first day in like 3 hours tho
[1:55:45] Byggareebob: seeding
[1:55:47] Byggareebob: of tournament
[1:55:49] othernewname: didnt they  do a very sick RLP time?
[1:55:50] minikori: yea but knowing the time is possible makes people search for it
[1:55:52] pinkqy: where's the dorkster
[1:55:54] Mythos24: Maybe sandbag for favorable matchup?  Or is it random
[1:56:04] Ruinx81: Where’s the Dorkster
[1:56:05] baconic12: no cringe strat saving?
[1:56:07] Byggareebob: Mandatory def sandbagged last  time
[1:56:08] Hemenia: not showing the comp that actually allows for a sub 10 run or smthing
[1:56:10] flabstv: WHERE DORKI AT
[1:56:11] draconisraccoonis: its ok to be wrong
[1:56:19] Byggareebob: mandatory was like top 10 in timetrials
[1:56:21] Byggareebob: and easily top 3 team
[1:56:22] punishcounter: Is there raid with busy with our dads?
[1:56:23] Rafi_DH: I thought they did too, at some point.
[1:56:23] quarantedeux: not showing that you have an insane strat to half the timer
[1:56:24] Reluctors: @Maximum they literally did in SL because they just quald and didnt go more for like rank1 on trials
[1:56:24] Camelbak21: dorki on next page maybe
[1:56:25] Priory: they did sandbag it to hide their real time
[1:56:27] Ruinx81: Where Dorki B?
[1:56:31] BeardlessDwarff: It has happend where they dont finish keys, just to not show tech
[1:56:32] HpMuZzY: What are your feelings of who the "best" healer is M+ and or raid in terms of the top teams and guilds?
[1:56:45] JBugaboo: they've definitely sand bagged previously to hide faster routes
[1:56:47] Shikoroh: zrtMDRflag
[1:56:56] alstadi: you probably do those keys a lot still just for practice, pretty sure those are the only keys you can run at the moment
[1:57:04] AbieCherry: they couldn't play a lot that's probably why they dropped Rx
[1:57:11] JBugaboo: theres youtube video of naowh and meeres talking about in the last mdi pretty sure
[1:57:17] lleguerre: Echo always smash time trials XD i don't think they sandbag
[1:57:18] draconisraccoonis: there are alot of things i dont believe in that are real tho soooo
[1:57:21] minikori: if you beat em by 2 minutes they will search for more skips but if you beat em by 10s they might not
[1:57:25] JansonLives: These dungeons aren't usually in the MDI pool I thought.
[1:57:35] Priory: they talked about it
[1:57:37] ebicman67: echo started the freehold stuff but the moment every team saw their comp they knew
[1:57:40] ModestMewtwo21: i
[1:57:41] dknamey: PepeLaugh he doesnt know
[1:57:44] mr_jimbone: You know if Dorki participating in this?
[1:57:53] burne114: @mr_jimbone He is
[1:57:58] nesshinx: Only reason to sandbag is to trick people into banning maps you are good at. But a lot of them would rather brag than sandbag lol
[1:57:58] klondike_wow: @mr_jimbone he is
[1:57:59] BigTrout3: Hold up. Ask yourself seriously if there's EVER been a tournament where the correct play is to min/max your win/loss record, risking placement and not qualifying,
[1:58:02] Kaaaaapek: w8 what they are doing 23 plus 3 without healer, wtf?
[1:58:02] quarantedeux: halls of valor S1 iirc ?
[1:58:05] TheeDucksays: I’m new to the wow esports scene. mind if I ask what these time trials are?
[1:58:06] Wincrediboy: Isn't that what Echo did with their plagueborer route in SL? Didn't reveal it until last day
[1:58:07] mr_jimbone: @mr_jimbone Awesome thank you
[1:58:08] othernewname: they always BANG in time trials just check the past eventson raiderio
[1:58:12] sorliee: classic snappin
[1:58:24] Rafi_DH: yeah, maybe that was it. sandbagging cups.
[1:58:26] baconic12: plus it makes other teams fear you
[1:58:33] RyanC: really wish your streamed mdi team came together @maximum

[1:59:16] ubba90: yeah sandbag some cause its proven that once a person proves sometihng can be done others can then do it. but if everyone doubts it then its still considers possibly not possible
[1:59:27] speedey__: Well that and Drogoh raided 14 days in a row to kill fyrakk

[2:09:06] caveman2x: survival
[2:09:15] othernewname: boomkin on the ground is melee
[2:09:17] DreadfuryDK: Outlaw should be separate imo
[2:09:22] DreadfuryDK: fair
[2:09:24] blacklight_____: outlaw is a lot tankier than the other two bc of evasion

[2:10:43] mystifyfps: is arguably better than both
[2:10:45] DrDozy: WW
[2:10:47] DreadfuryDK: Raid and M+ are very different. Ret's still probably the best on both fronts tbh
[2:10:49] LionButLeon: @Veroswen test realm HAH fell for it

[2:11:11] love4juju: DH is keys makes healers sad. they actually fall over in high keys
[2:11:15] drewsky96: fury definitely lives, but dps is dogshit in keys compared to the best
[2:11:16] Ristvakbaen1911: Does DH edge out because of Leech as well?
[2:11:16] gunshinsora: WW is lower i think
[2:11:19] Thirdheaven: rude
[2:11:20] aescend_: fury is big baseline, but no buttons
[2:11:22] leubinator: fury is a walking house
[2:11:24] Lenzoface: Fury is lacking utility, but they ahve good survivability
[2:11:24] khebul: WW is probably one tier below together with sub
[2:11:25] Ganryu22: ret tankier that WW? Really?

[2:16:28] Acting_the_goat: feral tanky boys
[2:16:30] Land_ZGZ: bring back corruption
[2:16:31] Zivrum: Make Vers Resilience again
[2:16:35] caveman2x: survival needs its own tier
[2:16:36] quarantedeux: ww can run out of defensives tho
[2:16:37] DreadfuryDK: Survival does not
[2:16:37] BigBlazingBull: whats this tier list for?
[2:16:40] Whitewolf1441: @Maximum can you talk more about what changes you want made to stats
[2:16:45] silmarilen: @Lenzoface fury doesnt get avoidance from talents
[2:16:51] Spartanate: Survival is Real big, Survival is literally in the name
[2:16:52] Ristvakbaen1911: @BigBlazingBull Melee defensives

[2:17:33] periphrase: hey chat what is the list
[2:17:33] Keppie__: survival over feral from what ive seen
[2:17:33] pork_pockets41: @Maximum When you're aimlessly flying around on stream, you should try it out as an evoker with the improved Soar. It's so much more fun.
[2:17:33] Squats3: wouldnt surv be better? its got crazy leech just build in
[2:17:36] Dritlukt: seems good
[2:17:38] beemer92bw: enhance is pretty squishy
[2:17:41] h0lyuwu: Surv gets a ton of self heal from mastery tho
[2:17:44] Joneim: @Squats3 Leech doesnt help vs one shots
[2:17:48] HoggyX1: garf
[2:17:50] shareandcare: thank you max, I was just asking for a link but you delivered, thank you!!!
[2:17:51] surtakscythe: can you explain why this is baisically a M+ tier list but fury is on top instead of on bottom?
[2:17:54] leubinator: garf
[2:17:58] aescend_: enhance can at least get 10% phys dr in darkheart garf
[2:17:59] Onyo1337: @h0lyuwu you dont want mastery tho lol
[2:18:02] Celticard: Celticard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:18:03] MeisterChiefX: survival runs literally zero mastery currently @h0lyuwu
[2:18:05] potatofarmer: I feel tanky onmy BM hunter but paper as MM. can't talkfor SV as i don't play melee hunter haha

[2:18:16] ArVee: @h0lyuwu optimal surv has 0 mastery gear lol
[2:18:16] caveman2x: garf
[2:18:18] Themselves: deathstrike in breath garf
[2:18:27] BigTrout3: that's a garf
[2:18:29] JackOfAllApocalypses: definitely do that...I hate it, but it beats dying
[2:18:31] MacRant: losing a 700k ele blast for a 15% heal Sadge
[2:18:40] LionButLeon: Ele is worse awaa
[2:18:41] just_ie: I mean they nerfed healing on enhance 4 times this expac so i gotta disagree
[2:18:41] LionButLeon: Aware
[2:18:42] TheItalianStallion321: hey
[2:18:45] Ristvakbaen1911: Isn't UH punished a ton more than (Oblit) frost for Death Striking?
[2:18:47] Onyo1337: they really have to rework surv mastery, its just garbage
[2:18:49] KaisenSiru: Shamanistic Rage Pog
[2:18:51] richie918: Not really surge needs to crit to heal meaningfully
[2:18:52] freppn: They removed hardened skin from elemental
[2:18:54] Exmachina126: @Maximum enh in WOTLK is the same thing. Maelstrom procc'd healing wave bombs to survive certain hits because their 1 big defensive in an Offensive lol
[2:18:54] Midsoi: boomies
[2:18:55] Joneim: Also Enhance just randomly not having access to shield, so they have half as much armor as ele and resto
[2:18:56] aescend_: would it be broken if we just slapped 2 stacks on astral shift
[2:18:58] AndyWhiite: I think as a windwalker I die on treeboss 28 tyran without externals
[2:19:01] purplefire132: @Maximum can you do ranged now
[2:19:03] Keppie__: We just need an extra button
[2:19:04] Dritlukt: gotta make use of that ankh
[2:19:05] Petarglio: buff warlock survivability
[2:19:07] Reluctors: another 8% hp and a small dr would be great
[2:19:08] starymnw: but then they prolly wont because of pvp @Maximum  Sadge
[2:19:11] Keppie__: we already have some decent passives
[2:19:11] joekandy: Mail wearers just always feel so fragile imo
[2:19:13] Pado99: ele and resto have sheilds for the armor
[2:19:17] pinkqy: Shamans need like a 45 sec dr cd and overall more HP
[2:19:17] Joneim: We already have 8% increased hp
[2:19:20] LuciFeariUm: warlock not tanky enough
[2:19:22] LuciFeariUm: buff warlock
[2:19:25] cyborgnoodlexd: arms is not bad with ignore pain aswell
[2:19:25] Jaborba: passive DR
[2:19:25] wired_11: shaman already has so many buttons lol
[2:19:26] love4juju: and a raid buff
[2:19:29] Joneim: Fair
[2:19:29] Bloodfoox: make earth shield into a real defneisve
[2:19:30] jaffie_chan: shamans already have tooooo many abilities
[2:19:33] Nox1o: did you think 4 dps can become meta for mdi in some torunament keys as well or only viable for the 23s? @Maximum
[2:19:33] Jaborba: or rework earth shield
[2:19:35] LionButLeon: @Pado99 there is way too much magic dam lol the way u think a shield is super useful xdd
[2:19:38] richie918: How is earth ele good
[2:19:39] htch1: feral hp buff pls
[2:19:49] Reluctors: @richie918 gives you hp
[2:19:55] ashstretchum0: give passive DR on both elemental shields make lightning shield worthwhile in pve with earth shield too
[2:19:57] aescend_: @richie918 its 15% hp for a full minute
[2:19:57] sim967: earth ele gives health to shaman
[2:19:58] LionButLeon: 15% earth ele with 5 min cd ICANT
[2:20:02] erkz007: @richie918 a 1 min rally, its pretty good
[2:20:08] Pado99: @LionButLeon getting trained be a rogue with a shield on is pretty comfy
[2:20:10] Nox1o: meeres said it has to be 25/26 otherwise its too easy
[2:20:12] othernewname: i think they dont understand what  MDI is
[2:20:13] ubba90: we want to see them fail
[2:20:15] wildheittv: I think bringing back perma totems (4min plant) should happen with SL, MT, VT etc remaining as is mechanically
[2:20:20] ubba90: to small and its boring to watch
[2:20:23] Faraday5001: or just do TGP instead
[2:20:28] JackOfAllApocalypses: 23 this season will be hilarious
[2:20:32] silmarilen: my favourite mdi's are the ones where they finish the whole dungeon in 4 pulls
[2:20:34] silmarilen: that shit looks insane
[2:20:48] Nox1o: i mean, time trials keylevel is always lower than tournament, isnt it?
[2:20:54] richie918: @erkz007 it's 5 min and worse than just bear
[2:20:57] jaffie_chan: Ascendance should make us look like a bigger version of Thrall
[2:20:58] pinkqy: you want to see them struggle, but not necessarily fail
[2:21:01] Gwedo18: When is the MDI
[2:21:03] love4juju: the keys feel different this season. mobs don’t have enough health.
[2:21:05] theskot: ya eb burst
[2:21:11] waelrick: the halls of valor wipe was epic though
[2:21:16] LuciFeariUm: eb burst
[2:21:17] theskot: that first eb pull gotta be gigantic
[2:21:17] ebicman67: you have MD for bursting potentially
[2:21:20] weezie_61: Dorki team moving up with ne healers now
[2:21:20] NattyPally: which team is dorkis?
[2:21:23] combobulous: Dwarf gang
[2:21:31] reggiepowa: I think they will be 25-26 keys, it was similar last mdi. 23 keys on time trials and higher on tournament
[2:21:36] tagzin_: dwarf too
[2:21:36] thenateo2: all dwarves
[2:21:37] thenateo2: too
[2:21:40] Lee_mes: destro can dispel magic
[2:21:47] LuciFeariUm: all those classes can dwarf except healer who can dispel themself and tank
[2:21:48] Dritlukt: darkness is actually decent for bursting
[2:21:48] asd123qwerty1: druid just dispells himself
[2:21:49] LuciFeariUm: who wont die
[2:21:51] Nox1o: i dont see everbloom noheal either way, abominations in huge pulls (prob multiple), 2nd boss, 3rd boss, last boss
[2:21:55] jamesmcnasty: kush on warlock ???? wtf has this world come to
[2:21:56] Keppie__: Is enhance with Earth ele up just squishier than a ret just existing?
[2:22:01] quarantedeux: it's probably impossible to pop all the mobs at the same time for md, plants have no hp :(
[2:22:14] ogbuckwheats: its because they are doing multiple bosses at once need a healer for that I think
[2:22:18] Nox1o: also the stingers
[2:22:26] QlicTV: how is last boss eb doable without healers, need some passive healing
[2:22:29] mongo11b: therealbigmongo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Has your opinion on Augs in high keys changed or do you still feel like the spot would be better fit for a real dps
[2:22:29] BeardlessDwarff: Aboms, firestorms last boss. hard to have defensives for each one
[2:22:38] TBouse: 3rd boss is one of the easier ones to no heal
[2:22:42] Nox1o: you sure? im expecting the playing trash with it
[2:22:43] Oracle_WoW: esp with CoT
[2:23:07] Dritlukt: i wonder if they can pull the petals from downstairs
[2:23:07] Ristvakbaen1911: You're correct
[2:23:07] ogbuckwheats: they're pulling wither bark onto 3rd boss
[2:23:08] Baskkov: its way too many reasons you want a healer, no shot anyone will do it without
[2:23:09] Gwedo18: no
[2:23:09] Keppie__: You can do some shitters
[2:23:09] roatog: I think you NEED a healer for external+utility in most situations.  Not to actually heal in a lot of cases.
[2:23:10] zylverb0x: hey
[2:23:10] Sekrai: maybe pull assistants?
[2:23:10] othernewname: noi
[2:23:10] Rebizle: correct
[2:23:11] Gwedo18: need to kill those 3
[2:23:12] Rebizle: no
[2:23:12] joekandy: it is
[2:23:14] Nox1o: nah, gotta kill the 3
[2:23:15] quarantedeux: you can pull it with assistants
[2:23:16] Ristvakbaen1911: You have to kill those three befor she spawns
[2:23:21] roatog: What if they leave the plant packs and pull plants into them
[2:23:28] LuciFeariUm: assistants are shitter tank killers
[2:23:29] Nox1o: everything else maybe LUL
[2:23:31] passing_d: what happens if you have more then 2 embellishment?
[2:23:33] Faraday5001: whats more efficient.... do g32 natty then all the trash with boss... or all trash then do 3rd boss?
[2:23:33] LuciFeariUm: thats literally it
[2:23:45] silmarilen: @passing_d you cant equip the third one
[2:23:50] ogbuckwheats: meeres said HE WAS COOKIN something up
[2:24:10] beast2: if you shadowmeld and taunt outside the arena you can drag witherbark around
[2:24:23] Lee_mes: maybe they have resto with the extra range talent pull stingers from outside the area
[2:24:27] Nox1o: i think echos 12min was yesterday when everyone else was still on 17min
[2:24:36] LionButLeon: catJAM
[2:24:39] othernewname: dorki  #15 already Pog
[2:24:39] Nox1o: they might not have played or did other dungeon
[2:24:40] Warzam: Dorki on first page Pog
[2:24:44] shareandcare: it was all melees in rwf and now all ranges in mdi, kinda balanced in a weird way
[2:24:50] lleguerre: Lol just imagining the first boss following them through the dungeon seem really fun
[2:24:53] quarantedeux: you send the warlock to solo the tree and you 4man the rest of the dungeon KEKW
[2:25:00] pinkqy: I can't wait to get JB in here to watch these no healer keys
[2:25:01] Yarbek: is that for sure no heal full key or can they zone out and swap?
[2:25:17] noewon: RIPBOZO healers, get them out of my game.
[2:25:21] Nox1o: there are pretty much only casters across the leaderboard LUL
[2:25:35] burne114: dorki making an appearance on page 1
[2:25:41] Whitewolf1441: now theyre gonna flood dungeons with dispell mechanics
[2:25:42] ManuVex1: what dungeon are you most excited for to see them do crazy stuff in?
[2:25:43] Zizonyx: eavLurk
[2:25:48] lolwhateverdog: i get not sandbagging in general, but a team does have incentive to sandbag and not show they can do a certain dungeon with no heal in time trials, right?
[2:25:52] goldard: need to equip the character
[2:26:08] potatofarmer: should just bring a second balance druid that takes all the healing stuff and uses heart of the wild for the big healing parts haha
[2:26:16] 0_____Kappa: people already do that in 30s as well KEKW
[2:26:17] quarantedeux: DHT has potential for a crazy opening pull
[2:26:18] Nox1o: fall and rise will suck imo
[2:26:20] Ristvakbaen1911: I think they avoid the leeches
[2:26:25] Zarroe: cant wait to see people fail the running gauntlet in rise xdd
[2:26:27] Rebizle: that stuff spawns slowly
[2:26:30] Petarglio: quad dragons GIGACHAD
[2:26:37] TBouse: those arent that exciting tbh, just a lot of damage
[2:26:41] Wincrediboy: I saw Andy pull the whole first room onto the boss in a 30 last night lol
[2:26:42] Nox1o: havent people done triple dragon on 28s+?
[2:26:42] othernewname: skip the dragons?
[2:26:42] silmarilen: ive seen people pull triple dragon on a 27 tyran on live
[2:26:43] guynormally: triple dragon no healer?
[2:26:45] twinkieruler95: when is MDI?
[2:26:46] greenmachine11235: Snap onto dragon?
[2:26:50] Zoulis: people did triple dragon in 30 on a fortified week, deffo triple dragon
[2:26:56] guynormally: xdd
[2:27:00] roguerhino: the team in 20th for eb is live rn lol
[2:27:04] roguerhino: maybe steal some tech
[2:27:09] larkhill: i wanna see how groups do the gauntlet in dawn and if anyone loses to failing it
[2:27:09] MathineGrim: MathineGrim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:27:10] TBouse: who is doing triple dragon on 30 fort???
[2:27:19] miraagex: KEKW
[2:27:19] hottfuzz24: delete the orange room in rise
[2:27:20] goombacci: delete rise baseg
[2:27:22] Nox1o: 3 mini bosses and then the rest with boss for funnel
[2:27:26] othernewname: the guards are bonkers
[2:27:29] danny1up: wait is dorki not playing with yummi?
[2:27:31] weezie_61: cant snap in waycrest anymore tho
[2:27:32] Lee_mes: wyrnstone pull in weycrest?
[2:27:40] Wincrediboy: Does anyone ever go right or up in waycrest?
[2:27:40] nanerpus_: fountain was fixed
[2:27:40] greenmachine11235: Fixed
[2:27:47] goombacci: eb could be sick
[2:27:49] Nox1o: shadow gonna pop off
[2:28:03] TBouse: bolster affected bosses back in the day too
[2:28:06] Ganryu22: you could snap boss + adds
[2:28:09] lleguerre: I feel like unholy will be very good in waycrest for example
[2:28:11] quarantedeux: if we get a sanguine wm i'll riot
[2:28:29] Paleee_: BRH probably no healer key
[2:28:31] javybavy: rise is gonna have like one huge pull then RP
[2:28:44] Nox1o: this feels like a horrible mdi season based on dungeons
[2:29:00] nanerpus_: what are the MDI rules with something like previously unknown snapping
[2:29:00] rukt: pulling undead side AINTNOWAY
[2:29:02] Petarglio: should've been tgp Sadge
[2:29:05] Wincrediboy: Why do people like snapping? It's such awful gameplay
[2:29:12] Nox1o: everbloom and dht only real dungeons with possible variety
[2:29:16] lurk_e: everbloom goated
[2:29:16] CrackedOrb: everbloom is just warlock gate through walls nonsense
[2:29:27] trashLEM0N: trashLEM0N subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[2:29:40] Lenzoface: throne is such a W-button dungeon, very linear
[2:29:42] misran: @Wincrediboy i think because it solves the thing people hate most in dungeons, casters that refuse to move
[2:29:53] Lenzoface: Throne is fun, but linear
[2:30:18] TBouse: throne sounds like it'll be predictable but very hard to execute
[2:30:26] Nox1o: @Wincrediboy it instantly groups up enemies so you hit everything and allows bigger pulls that way, its just fun
[2:30:28] skluer: do you think they will skip as much as they can in that room so they can pull it with 2nd boss
[2:30:28] reggiepowa: maybe atal as well
[2:30:29] Wincrediboy: Do you ever invis pay the ravager and pick it up after 2nd boss?
[2:30:43] emilza: Whens the MDI?
[2:30:48] passing_d: you can but it sheneeds to be in the center of the mobs
[2:31:11] Nox1o: skip as much of the room as possible
[2:31:13] Whitewolf1441: max any old dungeon youd like them to mythic+ify?
[2:31:21] Nox1o: the funnel is real for the comps
[2:31:47] goldard: u cant
[2:31:58] Nox1o: nah
[2:31:59] quarantedeux: you can pull onto 3rd no ?
[2:32:02] Nox1o: overlaps with silence
[2:32:07] Nox1o: with that many grips
[2:32:14] Wincrediboy: The pull ins when you need to hit totem sounds terrible
[2:32:15] Nox1o: i doubt you can sync everything perfectly
[2:32:23] TBouse: you can los the grip
[2:32:27] nok_gg: no shot they're hitting totem
[2:32:30] Eltved3: there's probably gonna be some 25s in there
[2:32:33] Lee_mes: 3 range group can los the grips
[2:32:39] Captain_matt: If they're gonna do time trials, I think having like a +5 bracket after the main bracket just for shenanigans would be great
[2:32:43] CruuuLest: 10:45 everbloom  23 is wild
[2:32:53] CrackedOrb: they cant be sync'd theyre coded not to be
[2:33:02] greenmachine11235: Shadow damage Amp on left side would kill trash into that boss
[2:33:03] CruuuLest: tbh i think they will
[2:33:09] CruuuLest: but it still is insane
[2:33:18] Paleee_: @Maximum Have u seen the oakheart tech in everbloom? You can move the first boss out of his arena
[2:33:22] muonz: what happened to avade tournament realm
[2:33:23] rawmins: rawmins subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[2:33:24] Nox1o: feels like a lot considering its an entire last boss single target bloodlust
[2:33:34] symbolicben: do u think this is the time echo might be beat at mdi ?
[2:33:37] mcfireCH: @Paleee_ they fixed it
[2:33:38] Wincrediboy: Reverse sandbagging, now echo know there's a better route to look for
[2:33:38] fizzis_: that was fixed
[2:33:51] shareandcare: I wish you could see the deathcount in that 10:45 EB
[2:33:52] draconisraccoonis: @Paleee_ Oakheart is DHT, and they fixed it
[2:33:52] symbolicben: from moad moad squad ?
[2:33:54] Camelbak21: Fixed on the tourney realm tho? Keepo
[2:33:54] Paleee_: Oh I figured they deffo used that to get 10mins LOL
[2:33:56] Baskkov: I did that once, was super fun
[2:34:00] goldard: echo has like 3 teans
[2:34:04] ogbuckwheats: @Wincrediboy you think echo goes with there best route in time trails?lol
[2:34:07] Nox1o: never beat against echo
[2:34:11] pinkqy: can a perfect run on the same route account for a full minute?
[2:34:12] Nox1o: bet*
[2:34:30] ogbuckwheats: if mandatory can actually game there is a chance but echo is to fucking good
[2:34:48] Taytor: Legendary
[2:34:49] weezie_61: Perplexed
[2:34:51] Nox1o: echo, mandatory, perplexed
[2:34:52] Keppie__: Perplexed
[2:34:53] symbolicben: perplexed?
[2:35:01] shareandcare: click on time trials teams above for teams overview and names and current times
[2:35:05] symbolicben: dorki lepan
[2:35:06] aurochz: they blast
[2:35:11] Whitewolf1441: what does echo do that isnt replacable?
[2:35:12] Nox1o: those 3 have been close the last few tournaments, no one else was close
[2:35:13] DreadfuryDK: The sheer concept of a 0-healer Rise is so wild to me, like how do you do Tyr LMAO
[2:35:17] bem0nade: where is dorki and the squad at?
[2:35:18] Wincrediboy: How much is that because they're 5 great players vs because of synergy?
[2:35:19] miraagex: swag is cracked
[2:35:19] Lenzoface: Maybe Fragnance team and DrJay team?
[2:35:19] symbolicben: yipdh prolly pretty good as well
[2:35:19] Oracle_WoW: @Maximum has there ever been 2 bosses at once pulls in an mdi?
[2:35:23] hivplus__: NA LAST HOPE RAAAHHHHH dorkiUSA USA
[2:35:31] miraagex: xesevi too
[2:35:32] chanpa: There is a team tab
[2:35:33] Nox1o: maybe legendary, but i doubt it
[2:35:34] quarantedeux: looks like dorki has figured the no healer route
[2:35:37] ogbuckwheats: legendary
[2:35:39] TBouse: drogoh on rdruid OMEGALUL
[2:35:41] weezie_61: Dorki one first page now
[2:35:42] Rebizle: What about JPC and nerf ?
[2:35:51] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[2:35:55] ogbuckwheats: lepan tobo hopeful splat and wexi
[2:36:02] brosciencegym: drogoh LUL
[2:36:03] Lrauq: USA o7 major upside: does not know what the fuck a kilometer is USA o7
[2:36:11] StanRaenslen: dorki's team had perfect comp for TGP
[2:36:12] symbolicben: they on first page
[2:36:13] brosciencegym: HOPful will dominate
[2:36:13] ebicman67: refresh, they did a no healer key with drohgoh on aug
[2:36:13] symbolicben: now
[2:36:13] wiffysniff: goop WideTHD
[2:36:14] aurochz: goop seems like he can play anything at a high lvl to me
[2:36:16] Taytor: what about hopeful's team? @Maximum
[2:36:21] weezie_61: Kira's Team
[2:36:26] klapp_: Drjay's team
[2:36:30] pinkqy: No respect for your boy Yip
[2:36:33] Nox1o: @Rebizle they imploded, but doubt they would have been close to those 3 in their kinda first mdi
[2:36:37] klapp_: number 10 here
[2:36:45] purplefire132: does elle's team compete
[2:36:54] ogbuckwheats: no
[2:36:55] surtakscythe: what about drjay team? It's fire mage meta which will help them probably right?
[2:37:01] Throckytv: no healer meta KEKW
[2:37:06] dk_koshmar: no ellesmere????
[2:37:08] soddalele: why doesnt liquid have an mdi team
[2:37:15] N3AT: our hopes rest on na's last hope
[2:37:16] Nox1o: echo players on all their teams, fixed already KEKW
[2:37:21] jamyynn: is lock meta or this an affix diff?
[2:37:21] DreadfuryDK: I legit did not expect Destro to be this dominant
[2:37:21] CruuuLest: the time differences of the top 20 teams in each key really shows how creative teams are pullwise, with everbloom giving more freedom in pulls and it shows in the times
[2:37:24] DreadfuryDK: I think we saw some Dev?
[2:37:25] Pado99: what spec are the mages?
[2:37:27] symbolicben: prolly in vc with thd lol
[2:37:33] wiffysniff: it's the age of destro?
[2:37:34] symbolicben: learnin destro as they go
[2:37:34] KapWaller: Why do you think no ret or havoc
[2:37:37] MBG_95: not exactly the hardest one to learn for what they need
[2:37:40] Memprhicann: Memprhicann subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:37:41] DreadfuryDK: Also, Aug with a 4-DPS comp is so unbelievably bonkers in this context.
[2:37:42] symbolicben: but aug drogoh
[2:38:14] CruuuLest: I am known for good points :) how about an analyst job? Kappa
[2:38:35] bozzymodo: yip, frag kush drenaco?
[2:38:45] Paleee_: Wouldn't aug in a 4dps comp bring more dps than just a 4th dps spec? @Maximum
[2:38:49] Nox1o: yeah, its prob smarter to practgice other dungeons than tryhard those 2
[2:39:11] asd123qwerty1: like why pick rize as time trials, terrible dungeon for this specific competition
[2:39:23] quarantedeux: remember that sanguine on council boss in mdi nokhud
[2:39:28] TBouse: wasnt moad playing aug in their top runs?
[2:39:31] audrock7: Max its Friday Jr. Time to hit some claws
[2:39:52] slimicc: How do we feel about no healer tho?
[2:40:01] pork_pockets41: @Maximum Have you played with the improved Soar yet on evoker? Great for mindless flying around. Very fun.
[2:40:12] Nox1o: may no be fast if they need to change pulls, so we wont know until the teams tell us
[2:40:13] miraagex: word of glory EZ
[2:40:15] wiffysniff: ret healing hands + crit is giga
[2:40:25] MBG_95: imagine the big gap this MDI is how good is the healer at playing DPS :D
[2:40:25] DreadfuryDK: Aug's DPS is kinda meh with 3 DPS. But with 4 and a VDH I find it hard to believe Aug wouldn't curbstomp the competition.
[2:40:32] naro1089: yeah ret off healing is bananas rn
[2:40:37] Nox1o: their aug comp is only 25sec faster than the same team with healer, maybe not a clean run though
[2:40:41] TyHeals: yeah ret off healing is too lit
[2:40:48] symbolicben: my guild thought i was crazy for saying no healer in mdi i think its going happen for a few keys honestly
[2:41:00] OperationSena: resto druid just do the best prio damage?
[2:41:05] Nox1o: also highly depends on keylevel
[2:41:06] DreadfuryDK: What's the other one? BRH? DHT?
[2:41:09] weezie_61: Yeah, IU dont think Moad plays dps
[2:41:16] DynastyLowBrain: @MBG_95 jb prophecy comes true
[2:41:17] Nox1o: what you live on a 23, might kill you on 26 wihtout a healer
[2:41:23] SemiCollin23: wait how is no healing possible?
[2:41:24] CruuuLest: good old times where mdi was +18s KEKW , id love to see what they would do in keys that are like +20s
[2:41:25] Throckytv: the group with tobo healing might be op cus he is an aug/dps main
[2:41:30] quarantedeux: dht should be no healable
[2:41:34] hendoughhh: whats that website? :)
[2:41:36] DreadfuryDK: I'm actually quite surprised Unholy isn't as much of a shoe-in as I expected.
[2:41:36] soddalele: good players can learn fast
[2:41:39] symbolicben: i think rise, atal, and maybe one more dungeon could be seen without a healer
[2:41:41] DreadfuryDK: And that Destro is DOMINATING.
[2:41:54] Spinerek: i am not a heal Madge
[2:42:00] discomancer1: Are you even allowed to do no-healer keys in MDI?
[2:42:02] Ristvakbaen1911: @symbolicben I don't think Atal on Tyran with unkickable Yazma
[2:42:04] Wheva: RISE is a terrible Unholy dungeon
[2:42:07] bittersteelwow: It's actually wild that Aug log hooks have been broken for as long as they have
[2:42:11] shizokubi: shizokubi subscribed with Prime. 
[2:42:14] miraagex: s1 mdi udk FeelsStrongMan
[2:42:15] Throckytv: uhdk is still tied to apoc, and uh doesn't get value out of int buff
[2:42:21] Ins1deMe: is that BM hunters?
[2:42:21] BIuffwatcher: so all ranged?
[2:42:23] TBouse: im surprised not in EB
[2:42:24] DreadfuryDK: Like, even Everbloom has no Unholy and that's the dungeon I would've expected to see Unholy used in
[2:42:25] noewon: NOTED Aug will replace healers in keys from now on
[2:42:29] dorki: keys too low for dk
[2:42:30] DreadfuryDK: Well, one Unholy.
[2:42:32] dorki: need prio dam
[2:42:33] symbolicben: @Ristvakbaen1911 its possible at 23 but it would be very difficult for sure
[2:42:51] Eleemz: @bittersteelwow Theyve fixed most of the issues, only some very small stuff left.
[2:43:02] Nox1o: does destro have good prio? dont they spam rof on aoe?
[2:43:08] DreadfuryDK: A higher-HP target, yeah. The stuff Shadow and Fire thrive off.
[2:43:18] Dinokaze: I'm surprised MDI is still a thing since TGP seems to get more hype and viewers
[2:43:23] weezie_61: Not ret tho
[2:43:24] MBG_95: @Nox1o destro turns to funnel eventually
[2:43:29] jamyynn: destro doesnt have a profile it just does it all decently
[2:43:30] Ristvakbaen1911: @symbolicben Idk with how frequently she casts I don't think there's enough defensive abilities
[2:43:31] daryl_fish: RIP feral funnel power
[2:43:33] DreadfuryDK: Destro gets funnel if there's enough targets iirc
[2:43:39] Paleee_: @Maximum maybe there's gateway tech too
[2:43:40] Azkrust: Destro prio pretty solid with 4 set synergy and trinkets
[2:43:46] DreadfuryDK: You cannot
[2:43:48] Yakarue: Destro has much better prio than previous seasons with rift damage. But still more blanket aoe.
[2:43:52] DreadfuryDK: I wish you could. I wanna study those SPriests.
[2:43:54] Nox1o: healthstone for no heal comp is also huge
[2:44:02] Ristvakbaen1911: Destro funnels with Rift damage technically
[2:44:03] KapWaller: Destro over demo tho?
[2:44:07] mahz: Ret offheal is pretty gross still though
[2:44:14] quarantedeux: also locks having 1M hp :'D
[2:44:21] miraagex: I believe someone in chat said rets recently got a bit prio on Templar Verdict
[2:44:29] LuciFeariUm: Team at #20 streaming just jumped to #8 EB with a 20:21
[2:44:34] OperationSena: why are the comps for rise much more uniform than everbloom?
[2:44:35] Spinerek: un HOLY
[2:44:50] Yakarue: And if they don't need the flat AOE. Simply using cataclysm + channel demonfire and then spamming CBs and Rifts is huge funnel.
[2:44:55] Makiv__: yo, whats BIS - low or medium height on the purple harmony?
[2:44:57] Yakarue: No globals spent on refreshing immo.
[2:44:59] DreadfuryDK: Rise is a pretty uniform key
[2:45:01] MBG_95: Because the best teams have done more times in Rise :D
[2:45:03] Nox1o: thats only so far
[2:45:03] DreadfuryDK: Like, there's very little variance.
[2:45:04] Nox1o: its day 2
[2:45:09] Nox1o: or 3
[2:45:15] weezie_61: The good teams are not playing EB yet
[2:45:26] greenmachine11235: Love the tank variety
[2:45:33] DreadfuryDK: Do we see a sub-10 EB?
[2:45:36] DreadfuryDK: I wanna see a sub-10 EB
[2:45:38] Spinerek: the eb cookout
[2:45:45] quarantedeux: you need dispels in rise, that kinda forces the comp
[2:45:48] Throckytv: when more people play EB, comps will get closer
[2:45:53] lleguerre: Rise is a comp dungeon while everbloom is a route dungeon
[2:46:11] Throckytv: there's a 13 min time disparity from 1st to last in EB rn
[2:46:17] DreadfuryDK: I actually thought MW would be the shoe-in, not Resto Druid.
[2:46:17] Keppie__: also time dif is pretty big
[2:46:17] symbolicben: @Ristvakbaen1911 assuming u have priest buff and aug buff i think everyone survives all of it.
[2:46:29] jamyynn: wtf a 10 min eb
[2:46:30] DreadfuryDK: RDruid damage is nuts too though
[2:46:37] jamyynn: i wanna watch that
[2:46:40] Ganryu22: Probably pulling the entire firs tpart, Necrotic Wake style
[2:46:46] Nox1o: are there even 16 teams yet? to fill the brackets LUL
[2:46:47] DreadfuryDK: More ST, yeah
[2:46:53] sedael: cat stronk
[2:46:53] mahz: 11 min eb at 23 is pretty wild
[2:46:54] ColdIceCreamMan: owlcat-weaving does big dam
[2:46:54] Juanzary: rdudu insane ST dmg
[2:46:56] Nox1o: vers buff for the casters
[2:46:57] DreadfuryDK: I think RDruid is by far the highest healer damage but it has to commit harder
[2:46:57] LuciFeariUm: @Maximum team #20 in EB is streaming, they just timed into #8 with a 20:21
[2:46:59] kalegeneral: Roar is just to good to pass up Gingi said
[2:47:01] KapWaller: Do you think vdh are running dmg or survival builds?
[2:47:01] Vitel__: You watching the all star game this saturday @Maximum
[2:47:07] Sekrai: MW would prolly be better if you brought more melee/phys dps rather than all casters
[2:47:08] quarantedeux: mistweaver does too much healing for a 22
[2:47:08] DreadfuryDK: HPal?????
[2:47:09] Nox1o: mw buff is useless in a caster meta
[2:47:12] Noxiirea: rdruid st is dumb xD
[2:47:17] DreadfuryDK: What is HPal doing up there, hello?
[2:47:27] TBouse: mythic dps isnt a good indicator, rdruids would have to literally not press healing buttons
[2:47:30] DreadfuryDK: Check H Volcoross, unironically
[2:47:34] DreadfuryDK: Shorter boss
[2:47:36] Noxiirea: I play resto and I can tell
[2:47:38] Remnxnt: check if those men are getting ebon might lmao
[2:47:42] Throckytv: MotW for the group is insane for 5man groups
[2:47:45] ColdIceCreamMan: i find rdruid damage far harder to play because of all the shifting around
[2:47:46] Nox1o: 3% vers is more than enough to justify it
[2:47:48] neno335: maybe heroic, more folks memeing
[2:47:49] Throckytv: like you eget so much dam
[2:47:52] Throckytv: yeah Nox1o
[2:47:55] 0_____Kappa: why are these numbers so low, rdruid can do a lot more
[2:48:13] Zivrum: Also with teir can still use tree healing as kitty
[2:48:19] chainpullz: dorkibear 90% of the time dorkiUSA
[2:48:20] asd123qwerty1: @Maximum did avade get back to you about tr?
[2:48:22] DreadfuryDK: Seriously, though, check H Volcoross. The boss being like ~1 minute long or so is probably closer to how long an MDI boss would be.
[2:48:24] Ganryu22: and not target cap
[2:48:25] Noxiirea: even when u heal u just using regrowth with guadian and u top everyone on clearcasting
[2:48:25] apocalypse912: 127k dps on a resto druid, thats basically better than half of weekly hc fyrakk pugs on dps classes
[2:48:28] QlicTV: everbloom bursting, they're only healing until 2nd boss :D
[2:48:28] skluer: also mystic touch with 3 casters is essentially not even a dmg buff
[2:48:29] TBouse: heroic will be pretty accurate
[2:48:29] theuwubomber: you should check heroic damage numbers will be way higher
[2:48:39] Vitel__: a 10:45 +23 everbloom is insane wtf
[2:48:40] weezie_61: Too bad this is an Esport that we cant watch
[2:48:50] kalegeneral: Who do you thinks got this MDI?
[2:48:58] Sekrai: @Maximum What's your thoughts on target capped for some specs and not for all/none?
[2:48:58] DreadfuryDK: Oh man look at that rank 1
[2:48:58] 0_____Kappa: 182k xdd
[2:48:59] DreadfuryDK: Holy shit
[2:49:03] Nox1o: 2min fight with bl, not really representable
[2:49:06] 0_____Kappa: 2 min kill timer though
[2:49:12] therencren: Can they not stream it? Or is it personal choice?
[2:49:19] Captain_matt: Be sick if they had like a live replay feature you could load in to the game
[2:49:22] Vitel__: you should be allowed spectating dungeons in game that would be a cool feature
[2:49:25] dertrapov: 10.2
[2:49:29] Throckytv: do mdi pulls last more than 2min?
[2:49:29] theuwubomber: dps is dps
[2:49:32] TBouse: heart of the wild is insane for damage windows
[2:49:32] JayPain: there gotta be someone streaming it
[2:49:36] greenmachine11235: Mdi should have random classes assigned on tourney day
[2:49:37] ColdIceCreamMan: doing more damage than my full time dps guildies Sadge
[2:49:39] DreadfuryDK: Wait, can MDI keys be streamed on Twitch now (in theory)?
[2:49:48] Harthad: a resto is a dps when fully commited to
[2:49:53] therencren: Mandatory is being a bro
[2:50:01] draingg: Why does it say team not set?
[2:50:08] Throckytv: it would be cool if they forced streams on for mdi
[2:50:17] Captain_matt: I do hope we get to see some uploads of scoring runs
[2:50:24] Captain_matt: after the thing is over*
[2:50:24] Wincrediboy: surely its kind of the as RWF on a smaller scale?
[2:50:27] Nox1o: makes sense for top 3, others might as well stream, no?
[2:50:32] AP_MISXO: tgp with everyone streaming was goated
[2:50:32] LionButLeon: Aware imagine
[2:50:38] DreadfuryDK: And it wasn't until Uldir
[2:50:57] Arvakr: didnt blizzard lay off a bunch of their esports staff across all games
[2:51:01] holdenwook: It's so fucking amazing that it's streamed.
[2:51:18] TBouse: you have to stream it otherwise your team would lose like all of its financial backing and people would have to get jobs LUL
[2:51:22] logdrop69: any cool non meta classes make the top runs?
[2:51:23] Cocotao: C'est stream it in lost ark
[2:51:30] Throckytv: ff is worse cus the tops teams don't stream though
[2:51:30] Vitel__: The benefit for an MDI stream is not nearly as much as a RWF stream brings in
[2:51:31] Faraday5001: i mean you dont stream raid testing, so makes sense they dont stream time trials
[2:51:32] Shikoroh: i mean there's money at the end, not for rwf
[2:51:35] zylverb0x: who started it? streaming wf
[2:51:36] DreadfuryDK: @Arvakr I don't think WoW was affected, but Overwatch was GUTTED iirc
[2:51:37] Throckytv: ff rwf
[2:51:38] xPriamx: but money
[2:51:39] Remnxnt: titanforges a timeline pog
[2:51:44] kalegeneral: Those Rise times are nuts
[2:51:46] Ewebbz: Streaming RWF is probably the best thing to happen to WoW in the modern era
[2:51:47] quarantedeux: a big part of it is that there's no prize money on RWF, you kinda need the content
[2:51:47] weezie_61: There is no prize money for RWF, so if you are 2nd what do you really lose
[2:51:52] drewsky96: rare proc timeline
[2:51:57] Nox1o: @Faraday5001 good point
[2:52:02] Vitel__: Advertising to like 50k viewers in the race brings in more money
[2:52:06] riptiedx: whens max playing some awc
[2:52:06] Captain_matt: Sponsors go fuckin nuts for the race, they barely care about MDI
[2:52:07] Gravitysfault: But the money in the race is guaranteed even if you come in a second right?
[2:52:08] Vendrek: What do you think about an Aug Evoker running [String of Delicacies] to further buff their team?
[2:52:09] DreadfuryDK: How much money is there in the race? Like, over/under? Or is that NDA shit?
[2:52:16] Erktraz: the amount just max's stream makes during the RWF is probably insane
[2:52:21] Bossalinie95: is the race payout six figures or sevens for teams?
[2:52:22] symbolicben: do we think 23 atal is able to be done with 1 tank and 4 dps ?
[2:52:28] Vitel__: Cum?
[2:52:28] LionButLeon: imagine knowing aug evoker abilities ICANT
[2:52:29] DreadfuryDK: What on earth is String of Delicacies?
[2:52:29] Ashille: there is no money unless you stream
[2:52:31] Madgeneto: mdi money KEKW
[2:52:37] Therealbrokensword: string of delicacies?
[2:52:37] Keppie__: he just made that up
[2:52:46] CoffeeASAP: at least 5k
[2:52:48] Vendrek: Its a necklace that proc gives mastery to party
[2:52:51] LionButLeon: holy baseg
[2:52:52] Vitel__: String of delicacies sounds like an innuendo
[2:52:54] greenmachine11235: Over 1$ and under 50000000$
[2:52:54] quarantedeux: @Maximum it's a questing neck that procs Mastery for your allies

[2:53:02] allmechanicsnobrain: Equip: While Well Fed, your spells and abilities have a chance of granting you and 4 nearby allies 449 Mastery.
[2:53:02] Dengara: It's a neck that procs mastery
[2:53:05] silverblayde: do you think RWF would be more competitive if it wasn't a stream/event every time?
[2:53:07] DreadfuryDK: Nope, wait, it exists
[2:53:08] soddalele: its not made up
[2:53:11] kalegeneral: bonebaby
[2:53:15] Dlaze001: @Maximum : " Equip: While Well Fed, your spells and abilities have a chance of granting you and 4 nearby allies 449 Mastery."
[2:53:17] Nox1o: its not made up, its a neck
[2:53:17] DreadfuryDK: Oh dear god its stats are dogshit
[2:53:19] DreadfuryDK: Oh my god
[2:53:21] holdenwook: is saudi oil money still involved in the rwf

[3:00:05] FVBBE: september
[3:00:06] Wincrediboy: if you don't mind sharing, how much are you relying on TL contract/RWF content vs regular streaming?
[3:00:07] FVBBE: august
[3:00:13] malnourish_: dont bring it up :(
[3:00:14] Rebizle: How was d4?
[3:00:15] reggiepowa: 9 months
[3:00:16] babysorim: fated season RWF
[3:00:16] Paleee_: @Maximum will you do TWW alpha content

[3:00:17] Milano___: November

[3:00:24] lurthemir: 7 months
[3:00:25] Vitel__: Comes in Sept
[3:00:26] robi161: Is it too late to play this expansion?
[3:00:26] JQ47: September
[3:00:28] OG_Kawngi: Early Sept
[3:00:31] therencren: Race is October I bet
[3:00:31] ogbuckwheats: 7-8
[3:00:40] MurtagDev: mid Oct i bet lol
[3:00:40] AndyBoyLIVE: aug 27th
[3:00:48] sirch1: dont forget the surprise pirate raid
[3:01:08] Sabre070: Do you actually make enough from race that you don't have to work much? Seems kinda wild.. tho I guess you have personal ad rev / spon too
[3:01:13] Yagr6: farming world rares and rep farms for meaningless gear cant wait @Maximum
[3:01:15] Nox1o: sepulcher we at least had fated
[3:01:22] Jazzarus_: IF they actually release the expacs at that rate, big IF
[3:01:24] Nox1o: no race but some content
[3:01:32] Wincrediboy: do you have any preferences between 1st/2nd/3rd raid of expansion? Are there similarities based on position?
[3:01:49] holdenwook: Do we believe Blizz is actually going to stick to the timelines and commitments they made pre-Microsoft acquisition though?
[3:01:55] Korupcija_: you should do cata raid 10 man
[3:02:01] Mehdehh: Surely they don't do only 2 raids in a 18 month expansion right Clueless
[3:02:03] AP_MISXO: 2 + fated xdd
[3:02:04] Vitel__: 9 months each content patch would be absolute piss
[3:02:05] beariicade: They are cutting down the time between races because bliz knows you are getting old
[3:02:07] ishka422: tehres still gonna be a 10 month gap atleast between start of this tier and next
[3:02:10] ubba90: i dont see 18 months really happening. they will start having 2 year xpac. they tried 1 year with wod failed so badly they went back to like 2.5+ but i see 2 being realistic
[3:02:10] quarantedeux: @AP_MISXO pls no
[3:02:10] Nox1o: @holdenwook they made those post acquisition too
[3:02:17] dembro: @holdenwook If Microsoft is pretty hands-off, why wouldn't they?
[3:02:19] Team_Spanky: @Maximum With everything going on in the gaming industry, taking any long term release plans at face value is a gamble
[3:02:20] Paleee_: @Maximum Will u do Alpha content for the war within when it comes out?
[3:02:24] dembro: LUL
[3:02:25] mr_jimbone: LUL
[3:02:25] nalegi07: Oldge

[3:02:31] TheBroCrow: HAH

[3:02:34] sedael: are they wrong?
[3:02:34] Helios_a: HAH
[3:02:35] TheFamilyHorde: You're not even 30 are you?
[3:02:36] ylisse7: how long has Max been old for?
[3:02:36] AndyBoyLIVE: HAH
[3:02:37] Scroffy_: Since 2018 Wow has been an old thing
[3:02:37] Vitel__: HAH
[3:02:38] CoffeeASAP: Times a tickin Max..
[3:02:41] blaylock2: lol well you’re no spring chicken
[3:02:44] zylverb0x: disagree
[3:02:48] ArcaneSyntax: Have you considered not being old
[3:02:55] nalegi07: maybe for esports, static games like wow are safer
[3:03:05] ashelfal: Shadowlands was delayed for a month
[3:03:05] robi161: Is it worth to start playing this expansion?
[3:03:08] Themselves: layoffs are for money. pushing stuff back is less money
[3:03:11] Nox1o: to be fair, its never guaranteed. not jsut in the game industry
[3:03:18] rudejerk: layoff metzen
[3:03:21] jondbr: dude arent you a young man by wow player standards
[3:03:23] DinkytheDoodle: Does anyone else cringe when they hear old man @Maximum use the kids lingo and try to sound cool, hip, and with it?
[3:03:24] Jazzarus_: Do you like short raids like Crucible of Storms?
[3:03:26] Arvakr: Sounds like something Blizzard would do
[3:03:33] ishka422: can deff see it tbh
[3:03:34] Themselves: cope
[3:03:35] DreadfuryDK: WoW players are OLD
[3:03:36] Helios_a: Def sounds like blizzard xd
[3:03:36] dembro: Young AF
[3:03:37] TheFamilyHorde: @robi161 Yeah.
[3:03:37] grobb12: Copege
[3:03:38] Klayjamin: A spiffing young man
[3:03:38] Zorto5: paid actor
[3:03:39] Nox1o: thats a lie
[3:03:39] Team_Spanky: Or combine the last 2 expansions into one expansion
[3:03:42] Stauss: don't compliment him
[3:03:42] Nox1o: paid chatter
[3:03:43] nalegi07: @Maximum would Grommy ever make an appearence on Poddy
[3:03:44] whiskeyhide: COPIUM
[3:03:45] DreadfuryDK: Like, I'm pretty sure most of the folks I raid with are in their early to mid 30s.
[3:03:48] CoffeeASAP: lol
[3:03:49] Scroffy_: what is the age average of liquid raiders?
[3:03:51] ArcaneSyntax: I'm older than Max, he's a young boy
[3:03:52] Arvakr: young compared to who
[3:03:55] Vitel__: I just started playing wow this xpac!
[3:03:55] DreadfuryDK: And I'm out here being nearly 26 and starting before most of them somehow
[3:03:56] Ristvakbaen1911: Can... Can they do something to salvage OW2 and bring back Heroes of the Storm, please?
[3:04:01] Nox1o: 47
[3:04:02] Vitel__: 30
[3:04:04] Sabre070: Also WoW is already developing multiple xpacs ahead anyway, not like they'll change release date for content that is ready-enough
[3:04:05] AndyBoyLIVE: 69
[3:04:06] robi161: Is it too late to start playing this expansion?
[3:04:08] DreadfuryDK: 62.
[3:04:15] Durenas: 24+ a few years
[3:04:17] dembro: monkaHmm
[3:04:19] Dr_Blocktopus: young attractive man max: GIGACHAD
[3:04:26] Yagr6: max brings that average up alot i bet Kappa
[3:04:30] Rebizle: Strapping young men arc
[3:04:35] rukt: trkBoomer
[3:04:42] bigmeanbeefy: Have you tried out the follower dungeons? :D
[3:04:44] velle014: Naowh? :O
[3:04:45] aavegotchi1221: Boomy guy LOL
[3:04:47] dembro: Boomie not-Boomie LUL
[3:04:51] gzok__: is that what #nochanges means

[3:04:57] Vitel__: LMAOOO Brawlstars GIGACHAD
[3:04:58] Nox1o: thats a phone game, or?
[3:04:58] muonz: is WoW just gonna die when we all become dads and dont have time to play
[3:05:00] sirch1: boomie not boomie not boomer
[3:05:01] Helios_a: LMAO
[3:05:02] Durenas: some young guy game
[3:05:08] Zorto5: ya a phone game
[3:05:10] YugeCrit: wow dads got no shot
[3:05:12] Vitel__: My younger brother plays brawlstars that dudes young as hell
[3:05:14] Wincrediboy: you're saying I'm too washed to become a RWF gamer?
[3:05:17] TheFamilyHorde: @muonz I have 6 kids and 3 of them play
[3:05:18] JakeParkbench: its like smash bros I believe
[3:05:19] LuciFeariUm: @muonz surprise, most of wow players are already dads
[3:05:20] dembro: I think the same company that made Clash of Clans made it
[3:05:22] glitsmonk: phone battle royale lmao
[3:05:27] Zandrilx: Yo lay off the 30+ man
[3:05:31] CLINTdotGG: I'm 30 and you're basically saying i got no chance. RIP :(
[3:05:32] nalegi07: nah you gotta pull in old war horses like JB for a tier to remind these people who the true gamers are
[3:05:32] Nox1o: im a professional candy crusher
[3:05:34] RyanC: still trying to do an io key once a stream?
[3:05:36] quarantedeux: How many dads are in liquid tho
[3:05:38] jondbr: I’m 31 begging to be recruited
[3:05:40] DreadfuryDK: Average age is 62. Imfiredup pushes the average up considerably because only a wise old man has as many wrinkles in his brain as Firedup does.
[3:05:55] Klayjamin: Does age specifically matter that much when it comes to recruitment decisions? I feel like WoW is one of the games it matters least in (compared to fps titles etc at least)
[3:05:56] Yagr6: age is just a number bro get good
[3:05:58] Vitel__: I'm starting to feel my age at 28
[3:06:02] Durenas: soon you'll be recruiitng people that are younger than wow
[3:06:07] Whitewolf1441: how old is thd
[3:06:09] aavegotchi1221: Be a muslim DAD WoW gamer, have 4 wives. Make 19 children and become a raiding guild
[3:06:11] sirch1: Scipe is like 46
[3:06:23] agrandorange: agrandorange subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Whats Wrong with 30+?  I've been playing since closed beta phase 2, I'm 37 and still playing FeelsStrongMan
[3:06:29] Nox1o: priorities change
[3:06:32] dembro: Right
[3:06:53] Themselves: if u wanna see a game where all the best players are old af u can check out poe
[3:06:54] Themselves: garf
[3:06:54] Vitel__: Or you're just naturally cracked beyond belief
[3:06:57] dembro: I'm 31 and I just wanna get Hall of Fame LUL I can't RWF
[3:06:59] Benny07: growing up sucks
[3:07:01] DreadfuryDK: Bro it's wild to think that by the end of the Worldsoul Saga there's a non-zero chance that you'll have people on your raid teams who were literal fetuses when WoW first launched.
[3:07:13] agrandorange: I can still be a degen gamer at 37, that's what PTO is for lmao
[3:07:23] JakeParkbench: Just be Ben is what you are saying
[3:07:29] Styxzthesage: o/
[3:07:29] Durenas: by the time the world soul saga ends you'll be raiding with people who were born from relationships developed in wow
[3:07:35] Klayjamin: But if you found an older person that met all the conditions, would their age still sway you away from potentially recruiting them
[3:07:37] lynxie26: just gotta find all the disabled old farts who can't work and only play wow
[3:07:41] noewon: BBoomer yep i got a whole ass career. i only have a hour each day to game.
[3:07:44] dembro: BabyRage Baby Raids
[3:07:45] DreadfuryDK: Holy fuck

[3:07:54] quarantedeux: holy fuck
[3:07:59] aavegotchi1221: Boomy guy = doesn't play boomy
[3:08:01] eyxx: hahaha imagine being young couldn't be me
[3:08:01] JakeParkbench: Exile is also quite young
[3:08:03] Korupcija_: old as wow
[3:08:03] dembro: That guy didn't even experience Y2K
[3:08:04] weezie_61: I am looking thru LFG for 26+ keys and there are zero. I think Blizz should make keys not lower until you deplete like 3 times... I guess I can just do my own.
[3:08:04] nalegi07: have you asked him to help you fix your computer yet
[3:08:04] misran: parents actually conceived him while raiding MC
[3:08:04] cmp_x: the tablet kids he was born to game
[3:08:07] cyberklinos: that is crazy
[3:08:07] reggiepowa: How did he even get into wow
[3:08:08] Vitel__: ya'll acting like he's some infant, dudes 21 lol
[3:08:09] DreadfuryDK: Bro was a sperm cell when WoW was in its early alpha stages, god damn.
[3:08:10] Nox1o: it gets real when you recruit the kid of an ex raider
[3:08:11] agrandorange: So, I work in collegiate esports, I have students who play wow that are younger than characters I made when WoW launched
[3:08:11] peepopyro: kick him @Maximum i can't be that old
[3:08:14] lurthemir: Gotta find some raiders born on the release day of WoW, they'll be the chosen ones.
