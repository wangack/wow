[0:36:15] sob590: The call was everybody right side I think
[0:36:20] PaperbackWritter: no drops?
[0:36:37] aly09848: felt like a lot of people were getting tail swiped when they weren’t close
[0:37:10] fraghil: they were like trying to back leg it but too far back leg.
[0:37:20] fraghil: the stack was more fan than line
[0:37:23] PaperbackWritter: I mean, drops for you
[0:37:48] Fluffymagicman: Yeah a lot of the group was just slightly behind back leg and that's tail zone
[0:37:54] Hamasta: !vacation
[0:38:37] fraghil: damage is so high it's kinda whatever as long as everyone stops dps on call tho

[0:39:55] Fluffymagicman: I don't enjoy Ahmpy's raid leading as much as Soda's Sadge
[0:39:58] fraghil: color is what kind.  you'll see purple later for shadow orange is fire
[0:40:16] Draleric: No FKP cobaltD
[0:40:48] DrAtomicPanda: worked so hard for that FKP Kappa
[0:41:48] Draleric: AQ20/ZG loot makes this such a joke though, they really should try for the harder raids NODDERS
[0:42:12] celnyaw: they can't really. they need cloaks of onyxia to do BWL
[0:42:13] DrAtomicPanda: hopefully thats the plan NODDERS
[0:42:37] Dogebert: AQ20 took down a few OF members cobaltFeels
[0:42:52] sob590: Soda and Ahmpy were discussing harder raids. The original plan was to start raiding one out of Nightmare Dragons/5 boss AQ40/3 boss Naxx

[0:45:51] PaperbackWritter: ahmpy
[0:45:59] EngeltheFallen: much more serious raid today
[0:46:10] Fluffymagicman: I really hope it's nothing serious. I know his parents are on the older side, like they were much older than most parents
[0:46:12] PaperbackWritter: he is a really good player
[0:46:45] Ambelie: @Fluffymagicman Same, I have older parents too and I couldn't imagine losing one right now
[0:46:47] PaperbackWritter: @Fluffymagicman his father-in-law died

[0:49:32] eggs_benedictator: Ahmpy is real solid and has the experience and demeanor for this
[0:49:35] Draleric: No one is doing damage cobaltD
[0:49:44] EngeltheFallen: think Ahmpy got this raid
[0:49:51] sob590: Ahmpy is a really good raid leader
[0:50:07] PaperbackWritter: yeah, better than soda, the only problem is if people don't respect him
[0:50:13] NorikM: dps meater on agro?
[0:50:19] NorikM: nvm
[0:50:31] EngeltheFallen: if they want to survive they respect his leadership
[0:50:46] Fluffymagicman: Oh Damn. Vei did post on twitter. I'm so sorry for her and her family Sadge
[0:51:08] EngeltheFallen: soda was shook up when he ended stream too
[0:51:29] PaperbackWritter: she is not even from the us right? soda may be gone for a while if he needs to go overseas
[0:51:35] Spens_: now THIS is the pace!
[0:52:02] Spens_: work keeps cucking me from raiding smh
[0:52:05] DrAtomicPanda: this feels more clean
[0:52:14] EngeltheFallen: want to say she was from poland
[0:52:17] EngeltheFallen: not sure
[0:52:21] Draleric: Rav needs to tame one of the core hounds MiniK
[0:52:25] Centurion_Havoc: did onyx get skinned

[0:53:04] PaperbackWritter: that is what a sweat leader does chat
[0:53:06] EngeltheFallen: sure her and soda will do whatever they need to do and the guild will keep up for when they come back
[0:53:16] Baeumelig: what is sunder?
[0:53:35] fraghil: no one could afford a third raid if they kept to Saturdays pace
[0:53:40] sob590: Debuff that reduces armour
[0:53:54] EngeltheFallen: this will be much, much faster
[0:54:11] Sato_Mori: top 3 EZ
[0:54:21] fraghil: basically causing a whole ass run on AH pricing for consumables at the first pacing.
[0:54:45] EngeltheFallen: will need people to farm for prep if needed then
[0:54:46] Draleric: Rogue loot ShakyEyes
[0:54:46] NorikM: no soda = no one trying to steal attention, lets hope it stays that way
[0:55:07] EngeltheFallen: well a lot of people kind of shook up too a little
[0:55:07] PaperbackWritter: well it helps that russel and tec aren't raiding too
[0:55:35] NorikM: @EngeltheFallen ohh yeah fair point

[1:29:01] NorikM: monkaS
[1:29:15] Fanrogh: Just at a quick glance what your raid needs is a pullhunter that is comfortable with scketchy pulls like that dog in-between the packs
[1:29:28] EngeltheFallen: that is sard usually
[1:29:38] celnyaw: yeah and rav did last time some iirc

[1:35:27] Lars_Keizer: I mean they can play GTA all they want, just show up if you sign up, that's the very least one can do
[1:35:37] Lars_Keizer: Other than Soda and Vei you'd expect everyone to come that signed up
[1:35:39] butlerlog: i find it really impressive how gtaRP makes seriously entertaining people's content extremely boring
[1:35:51] sob590: Perfect for watching like 2 clips a day to see the good bits LUL

[1:57:49] null_set: Maybe different person. I lurked a lot, and watch a lot of nyanners and aethel
[1:58:19] xxmatosxx1: @EngeltheFallen oh ok ok I don't understand wow that well, I watch Cobalt mostly for isac
[1:58:50] EngeltheFallen: balt also needs to remove curses and sheep things at times
[1:59:04] DonutHoles: looking like a Sikh
[1:59:05] EngeltheFallen: also if he ever gets to the top of the damage chart, he will likely be instantly killed
[1:59:21] Dogebert: Is the raid doable without the buffs or do they have that big of an impact?
[1:59:25] TrueBlue8: Hello everyone
[1:59:36] EngeltheFallen: in the OG days they did not use buffs and almost no one cleared this
[2:00:05] EngeltheFallen: with buffs, less than 1 percent cleared naxx 40 man
[2:00:28] Dogebert: The last time I played WoW was pre BWL. I beat Ragnaros and never played again.
[2:00:35] sob590: I cleared MC with no world buffs and no pots. We wiped A LOT
[2:00:39] EngeltheFallen: bwl is so scary
[2:01:05] xxmatosxx1: @EngeltheFallen will he be more target by the boss or something?
[2:01:06] PaperbackWritter: EZ
[2:01:15] Dogebert: Im excited for the BWL raids
[2:01:25] EngeltheFallen: whoever is doing the most damage is usually the target of the bosses
[2:01:28] Davechilla: did they skin Ony this time?
[2:01:30] EngeltheFallen: when mages become the target they die
[2:01:43] NorikM: didnt tha raid start at like 40 min in to the stream?
[2:01:46] NorikM: the*
[2:01:58] Dogebert: Does everyone need a cloak or only a few people?
[2:02:14] EngeltheFallen: anyone without a cloak if they get targeted basically die
[2:02:16] xxmatosxx1: @EngeltheFallen makes sense nut then the most dmg has to be tanky or do tanks have taunt?
[2:02:25] Dogebert: Damn Engel, that's intense
[2:02:34] sob590: 20+ cloaks is good
[2:02:42] EngeltheFallen: tanks do have taunts that helps but damage is a balance in this = when people fight to get top DPS usually some die
[2:02:58] EngeltheFallen: yeah shadowfire is no joke in BWL
[2:03:08] EngeltheFallen: the ony cloak is how you survive it
[2:03:29] EngeltheFallen: old way raids were all super interwined
[2:04:06] EngeltheFallen: then aq40 dropped and was just sup and they started just letting anyone try the raids without serious prep
[2:04:15] sob590: Zone in
