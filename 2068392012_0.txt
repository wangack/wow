[1:00:36] Verdell263: Gotta love the simple oversights of SoD. You can get up to 230 mining with an enchant to get Truesilver ore, but the training doesn't consider the +5 enchant skill and you can't learn to smelt truesilver.

[1:04:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:04:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Verdell263 48 hours yeah, my theory is since alchemy doesn't make an item to contribute to the epic crafts this is their way to make them relevant

[1:06:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: hardest part is the mithril to truesilver transmute pattern is a limited sell in tanaris
[1:06:13] Verdell263: It's just maddening to have ore that I can't smelt
[1:06:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: be worth a lot of skill ups next phase when you smelt it at least

[1:28:46] metavahn231: those hammers LUL are crazy
[1:28:52] Lupusdeus: It's not so much abt the relevelling of skills, as u can re-skill and start at the new base level (eg with some points to play with) the issue is re-gearing more IMO
[1:28:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looks rough
[1:29:13] raldrik: Anyone else struggle with a pet out? I keep trying to blow it up.

[1:33:52] dokor: if you want to respec and change build, you have to do it at a higher lvl, it's easier when you do it around 60 65. But yeah the best way to go about it is to pick you're build early and lvl with it
[1:33:53] darkkilla1: it takes about 10 minutes to level abilities from 10 to 20 with monos
[1:34:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: at 70 the new abilities start with 10 levels i believe
[1:34:10] darkkilla1: yes
[1:34:14] Etsku: nah it takes so little time to get the points higher level
[1:34:27] darkkilla1: first mono is 55
[1:34:38] mayonaes: the skills level super fast in the end anyways so no a super big deal
[1:34:42] metavahn231: prob would depend on build, would be hard if you swap out your main damage move
[1:34:45] darkkilla1: and abilities have a xp bonus to the max level
[1:34:46] raldrik: easier to find the proper mono also better gear you can have ready to go.

[1:38:52] N3llee: Yea I fall in that camp of not liking D4. And I'm huge Diablo 1 and 2 fan
[1:39:06] H_A_R_D_E_S_T: wow was the first mmo cant be beat
[1:39:41] timmythegamertv: @H_A_R_D_E_S_T Was it though? wasn't EQ before wow
[1:39:58] t_train_va: There were several MMO's before WoW
[1:40:01] TazIsSum: there is a long list of mmos before wow
[1:40:01] Vesidian: And Ultima Online..
[1:40:02] N3llee: its a goat from invester standpoint. Its a crap shoot in the opinions of most rpg players
[1:40:23] militaryman81: d4 is just in a bad season right now.
[1:40:45] zelours: What time is gnomer
[1:40:53] timmythegamertv: WoW was alot of peoples "first" MMO, which is why it's so popular..
[1:41:01] Altariaz: @militaryman81 agree, wow is immortal - greatest video game ever made (to date). Love it
[1:41:48] timmythegamertv: Would you argue that something like Diablo isn't soo much about the current title but the brand/name in generel..

[1:44:10] Altariaz: @timmythegamertv partly yes I think so, but game must be good too.
[1:44:13] GodKingMuninn: And frankly its a good thing if people talk shit on a game. That means its still alive. WoW being the example. Its when you hear -nothing- on a 'bad' game that means its truly bad.
[1:44:14] cynical_effect12: when you pulled passive points it removed the skills off of you bar.

[2:51:48] ottavianni: dosent have a search feature ?
[2:51:50] JoeHeff: !drops
[2:52:04] Lupusdeus: Add a 'hide all 2 handed'
[2:52:11] Longsokz: which is tankier? Pally or Void knight
[2:52:12] Lupusdeus: see if it disappears, and put it on top
[2:52:17] inxszane: so can we play offilne while server is down?
[2:52:22] PlutoInsanity: i'm guessing if you aren't hiding it, it has no reason to hide the item
[2:52:48] TheeCableguy: you dont want to hide all though you still would want unique and set
[2:52:52] Lupusdeus: put it on top
[2:52:57] Lupusdeus: yeah it's gone
[2:53:07] PlutoInsanity: might want to drag it below the "show all unique"
[2:53:15] GadgetPilipinas: !drops
[2:53:16] roeddogg: you have to keep in mind the higher the rule on the list the higher the priority. that might play a part in considerations

[2:55:16] TheeCableguy: yeah
[2:55:28] MackPlays: yeah
[2:55:53] Lupusdeus: i mean u can just edit the rule to hide anything below those in that rule
[2:56:01] Daerryn: It would be nice if there a hotkey to show all items to override the rule list
[2:56:10] PlutoInsanity: I think that will work
[2:56:23] Lupusdeus: @Daerryn there is, x

[2:58:35] TheeCableguy: I dont lose threat on mages at all with pally thankfully
[2:58:36] Slitze: don't like that guy anymore
[2:58:41] TheeCableguy: salvation is great
[2:59:03] Lupusdeus: The game might be based on classic, but the players will never be the same as they were back then tbh, you're right

[2:59:09] Slitze: turn the game into the dumbest shit
[2:59:12] metavahn231: you sap add 1 you sheep add 2
[2:59:17] Daerryn: I CC when my mage tries to solo raids :D
[2:59:19] Kaykerrs: Molv KEKW
[2:59:24] TheeCableguy: haha glad I level pally to 40
[2:59:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Molv representing
[2:59:34] Twizited: Thats the link
[2:59:42] Slitze: game is determined by his 10 man raid
[2:59:46] TheXune: The introduction of new skills and runes are steps towards its just being a different version of retail. So it shouldnt be a surprise when the meta shifts towards what retail is
[2:59:51] GodKingMuninn: Even good players back in classic were able to retain aggro. They just increased damage five fold and did nothing to compensate threat
[2:59:51] Gungre: I am going to look once servers are up
[2:59:59] Gungre: I will definitely let you know if my gnomer reset
[3:00:20] GodKingMuninn: oh so gnomer resets with BFD then
[3:00:35] Longsokz: they said 1 mil people brought LE. crazy
[3:00:52] TheeCableguy: Your being punished for betraying your Pally.
[3:01:05] Gungre: Servers up
[3:01:11] Ocenus: my gnomer is reset
[3:01:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tanking back then was a hassle, tab-tapping frantically trying to hold aggro on everything
[3:01:13] bakerbaker019: we live
[3:01:15] GodKingMuninn: Classic era tanking didn't have damage cranked five fold.
[3:01:15] Maellin: Hmm. WoW Tarot pre-ordered.
[3:01:21] bakerbaker019: Gnomer reset
[3:01:32] Gungre: Oceanus, did you walk into gnomer?
[3:01:36] TheXune: eExactly
[3:01:46] BlewGamingGroup: the aoe classes will adapt and overcome ... the tanks will still be fucked
[3:01:47] futomara01: explosive shot and trap launcher goes brrr
[3:02:01] TheXune: Even classic we just used fury tanks NotLikeThis
[3:02:06] Slitze: u know he's eating cake
[3:02:11] cta62: @Towelliee I don't always agree with you but here I do 100%
[3:02:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: sounds like what josh is saying is that gnomer will reset in 2 days on thursday morning and be synced up with bfd
[3:02:27] GodKingMuninn: Even ST aggro gets messy. I see my threat meter get very close to 2nd when a hunter uses raptor strike WITH salv.
[3:02:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: but everyone reset today
[3:02:38] cta62: yes
[3:02:40] MarkMurda: Im on the fence with this game. Especially since POE 2 is on the way. I jsut know Diablo 4 crapped the bed
[3:02:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: yes
[3:02:43] Slitze: bfd reset yesterday
[3:02:47] cta62: resets today and then thursday and every 3 days after
[3:02:54] Gungre: I'm gonna go look at it right now
[3:03:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a 2 day lockout then it becomes 3 day lockout

[3:27:15] D3CMON: Has anybody tried this game on a Gamepad and how does it feel?
[3:27:20] raldrik: you have to start with a hide all
[3:27:21] ContraRob: you aren't hiding all the others, you are just emphasizing the one hand weapons
[3:27:25] Nazgewl: The first rule I always make in a guide is hide ALL items
[3:27:26] Daerryn: It isn't PINK ... but you didn't tell them to hide
[3:27:26] kdubst880: You have to hide all first
[3:27:27] Rustcan: Because if you want to HIDE items, you have to specify
[3:27:28] ContraRob: you need a filter to hide those
[3:27:29] metavahn231: is it prioritized
[3:27:30] Dwaggle: yea hide all
[3:27:33] ambiotic: You have to hide then recolor
[3:27:35] expbottles: CoF or die
[3:27:36] Nazgewl: then everything after that will be show
[3:27:39] Daerryn: should end w/ a hide-all
[3:27:40] Lupusdeus: Your rule highlights the items u have chosen, it doesn't hide anything
[3:27:47] Nazgewl: no just hide all items total
[3:27:54] Nazgewl: all of them
[3:28:08] kdubst880: Hide all rarity
[3:28:13] raldrik: no conditions
[3:28:14] Daerryn: Just hide all weapon types
[3:28:37] pjr84: if you hide everything and put it at the bottom of the list, then is will only show what you want.
[3:28:40] thecollorian: !drops
[3:28:43] raldrik: start with hide all then build shows
[3:28:45] Nazgewl: if you have a "show rare" 2 hander
[3:28:50] Nazgewl: after the hide all rule
[3:29:04] mayonaes: The base is always hide everything then you add rules on top to show what you want
[3:29:08] Lupusdeus: Yeah u need to make these rules bottom up almost, hiding all works because u have a rule above it that SHOWS
[3:29:10] Nazgewl: don't even need that one
[3:29:14] Nazgewl: just save the hide rule
[3:29:15] mayonaes: easiest way to do it
[3:29:27] Nazgewl: Do you have a discord?

[3:29:52] Dwaggle: he was trying to still show uniques. this will hide those uniques. unless you now make a rule for uniques
[3:30:03] Lupusdeus: hide all goes bottom tho
[3:30:13] Rustcan: Put the Recolor rule at TOP - otherwise all will be hidden
[3:30:14] Nazgewl: yeah you want to hide everything, then show what you want
[3:30:16] Daerryn: Rules run from top to bottom and it applies the first rule that matches the conditions and exits.
[3:30:25] Nazgewl: hide all, then next rule "show all uniques"

[3:31:01] samwar_: that's going to hide those rarities
[3:31:01] Daerryn: The hide rule neds to be the lower rarities
[3:31:02] Lupusdeus: You can add a show all uniques and sets and put it on top
[3:31:11] mayonaes: just import blast cannons filter it is just the skeleton of rules with nothing in them and you just add your items you want
[3:31:13] mayonaes: super easy
[3:31:14] samwar_: you want to check the rarities you wan to hide
[3:31:17] mayonaes: and simple
[3:31:25] Dwaggle: boom. can change font and color so it stands out
[3:31:25] raldrik: keep that at the top
[3:31:27] Rustcan: Correct - just not at bottom

[3:32:12] ContraRob: did you set a filter to show armor and other items, since you have a hide all items filter?

[3:39:19] 91Niki: If the devs weren't wearing shackles, I am 100% sure D4 would be a very different game
[3:39:43] Lupusdeus: I think the issue for me, is that they built it for everybody - which, is fine, if they want to - but it ended up being for nobody because it's so basic with added shit on for the sake of it.

[3:40:43] Masqerader: nope
[3:40:43] DunzoCD: no retail isnt up yet
[3:40:45] Lupusdeus: The suits milked the cattle, that's all they care abt - devs are pretty hamstrung.
[3:40:49] ambiotic: Need stats in an ARPG and need crafting.
[3:40:55] FubarSnafuJJ: Negative
[3:40:57] ThatW0lF: is last epoch tools site down for anyone else?
[3:41:08] rymerre: sod is up
[3:41:28] rymerre: lissen...no one wants to log into retail
[3:41:48] aDistractionTactic: it's the 21st here in aus now
[3:42:00] Masqerader: the fucking portal colors for 30 dollars
[3:42:05] Masqerader: like that's something else
[3:42:25] Lupusdeus: Same, but for blizz to keep pushing it that way trying to make everything more and more expensive for fucking cosmetics, really put me off tbh
[3:42:25] MortalLesuj: they fucked up lockouts. gg
[3:42:27] Arocian: ppl must be paying
[3:42:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: i only buy the battle pass for $10 and you get back $7 of currency so its not too bad
[3:42:34] ambiotic: it would be fine if the game was good. But keep asking me for money when i dont even wana log in.
[3:42:36] N3llee: 100%
[3:42:36] Masqerader: or they looked good?
[3:42:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: lockouts are fine
[3:42:44] 91Niki: Oh yeah if the game was in a great state, most people wouldn't bat an eye
[3:42:58] N3llee: good game play = more play time = more opportunity to spend money
[3:43:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: it reset its just a 2 day lockout for gnomer then it goes to 3 day
[3:43:03] MortalLesuj: they  didnt reset them. just changed the flag to 3 day lockouts. so if u did gnomer yesterday ur saved until thursday
[3:43:05] metavahn231: oh you didnt go into raid with a crack team that 1 shots it, no more raid attempts for you

[3:43:20] Twilight_Knight_: The stock holders probably to the point that they are willing to let the game slowly die by milking community to the extreme.
[3:43:27] Rustcan: D4 skill trees = too little variety; itemization = boring; not fun and no 'wow' moments

[3:43:29] Lupusdeus: I bought 2 packs from LE where i liked the portal and pet having played abt 100 hours of LE, i knew it was worth it. Not paying money to blizz again i'm afraid.

[3:43:44] Lupusdeus: in D4 at least

[3:44:23] Arvidian: retail is up
[3:44:24] Masqerader: @Rustcan every game with skill trees/talents is gonna have cookie cutter builds, nothing will ever change no matter how trees/talents are structured
[3:45:11] Masqerader: and when u kill fyrakk be like "go fyrakk yourself?
[3:45:19] MortalLesuj: there were tons of ppl tryna to get last second bosses last night so suchs for all those ppl
[3:45:20] ambiotic: Why hasn't it been nerfed yet
[3:45:22] MortalLesuj: yeah straight fyrakk
[3:45:24] ambiotic: just gut the fucking place
[3:45:25] Roobi_doobi: we are stuck tindral
[3:45:32] MortalLesuj: its been nerfed
[3:45:35] MortalLesuj: what are u talking about
[3:45:42] Masqerader: I am still laughing they fixed the "bug" with the flying
[3:45:43] Lupusdeus: @Masqerader You're right, but some trees are better than others with more variety, D4's is at the bottom.
[3:46:09] ambiotic: HP and Damage
[3:46:19] 0gpulse: root hp maybe but doesnt need it
[3:46:27] ambiotic: Just boss HP and damage
[3:46:32] meldris1: we just killed fyrakk last night. best guild rank yet!

[3:48:23] Ilibrit: we killed it Sunday, 360 pulls
[3:48:26] plddn: I see why no one plays d4 take forever to gear and lvl then u can’t even kill a dungeon boss to up your tier
[3:48:27] drewetling: hang on i just got in
[3:48:30] Masqerader: still stuck
[3:48:30] ambiotic: Its not that its hard, but your player pool for mythic 2 day and cutting edge at the end of the tier type players is pretty empty right now
[3:48:36] Ilibrit: tindral
[3:49:03] Roobi_doobi: skill diff i guess /shrug
[3:49:12] Ilibrit: our main issue in 2day guild was people having tech issues then  some getting frustrated at p1 and not showing
[3:49:22] Roobi_doobi: thats where we are, grueling af
[3:49:31] ambiotic: it is a skill diff
[3:49:47] ambiotic: thats why people do 2 day casual guilds cause we are not as good. But like its been months, just gut it
