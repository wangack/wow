[0:05:51] figurines: @venruki we all just wanna know about wizk and the link killing. what weak aura he using. mousover macro? why didnt he share that tech with his teammates. Investigation needed!
[0:05:58] michaelbigdam: awc was real good this weekend !

[0:06:32] zachgamegodx: funny that eu always says EU is such meta slaves so its more competitive meanwhile they're finals was completely off meta and ours was super meta
[0:06:45] bollskis: gj casting bruv
[0:06:52] squarepusher_: rps is meta?
[0:07:05] zachgamegodx: does it need to be holy priest?
[0:07:07] Aroty: I have to root for Eradas at this point
[0:07:14] heymomimonttv: yoooo ven you guys did a great job casting. there was a pointyesterday i had to drive for an hour and i threw on the stream in the car and was able to keep up just by listening. what a great cup
[0:07:16] figurines: Ok fair enough. Never seen it done. But he did it twice in tourney. Seemed to blow the casters minds at the time and it altered the strats for liquid, tyring to only drop link when he is CC or LoS. but i guess this morning its not mind blowing.
[0:07:25] leeka: rukiBuddy rukiBuddy
[0:07:33] leeka: mornin
[0:07:33] Somanie: I wasn't expecting any of what happened yesterday

[0:07:54] hermbot2: when should we expect nunruki back?
[0:07:55] leeka: nah
[0:08:01] zachgamegodx: i think like outlaw shaman/druid any caster besides aff lock or fire/frost is meta
[0:08:01] leeka: mystical did
[0:08:06] Nachofez: @bollskis hi drew
[0:08:08] heymomimonttv: fr echo and liquid losing both blew my mind. everyone competed like chads

[0:09:08] zachgamegodx: boomy looks extra squishy
[0:09:11] rockxtv: one of the more exciting AWC's in a long time
[0:09:25] rockxtv: variety was amazing
[0:09:26] Mythh_93: Morning mate :)
[0:09:27] Nachofez: it was at 20k viewers on twitcg
[0:09:30] Zeniticon: WW is op
[0:09:35] heymomimonttv: seeing echo lose back to back to newcomers was not on my 2024 awc bingo whatsoever
[0:09:35] carrvve: had a great time. viewers stayed around 20k yesterday
[0:09:54] mastacastah: Ven i got a question about the last game of the tourny if I may just talked to jelly about it and basically got my answer
[0:10:08] michaelbigdam: cant wait to see everyone trying ww monk sub rogue hpriest
[0:10:15] jay_the_farmer: yesterday awc was one of the best i have seen
[0:10:24] Nachofez: @jay_the_farmer for real, insane games

[0:10:30] bollskis: wiz was cracked
[0:10:32] Somanie: It was insane
[0:10:37] bimboou: We need to talk about that spirit link
[0:10:48] mastacastah: if mes were to play the blood dk he was practicing do you think it would have went diffrent i do very well into outlaw rogues and im 2.2k blood dk in 2s tho not 3s.
[0:10:48] jay_the_farmer: shame about the casters :P
[0:10:56] jay_the_farmer: joking
[0:10:59] reedthesham: I was convinced the spirit link got put ontop of the statue
[0:11:12] Somanie: Everyone was accusing Wiz of scripting or smth when he insta got those spirit links??
[0:11:33] heymomimonttv: i mean echo is reasonable players, they prob understand they have a lil bit of growing pains with lontar currently. they do well together but really gotta hit their groove
[0:11:46] mastacastah: thats what jelly said so your answer was exactly his lmao! this is why i take my answer to the pros
[0:11:49] Vramii: I felt like EU was a one team show for a while now. foregone conclusion that Echo would win. good for the game to see them lose honestly. that being said, I bet they come back and win the next one.
[0:11:54] michael_helder: Is druid still best healer haven't played in a bit
[0:12:10] Spaceberry_McDuck: you and the other casters seemed like you guys were having fun yesterday
[0:12:27] Nachofez: the ziqo screams were funny
[0:12:32] poroyou: I had to check if this was my playlist
[0:12:33] shroomagi: has the totem drama been resolved?
[0:12:44] marvin1995xo: addon weakaura
[0:12:45] figurines: @shroomagi nope. not even in the slightest haha
[0:12:49] rockxtv: guy plays FPS at a pretty high level too, he's got the apm/accuracy
[0:12:50] reedthesham: Wizk is incredible
[0:13:00] Zeniticon: the effect has a large delay
[0:13:01] Guettalx: mouse over macro 100%
[0:13:07] 1Haiden: he was channeling void shift just hovering and waiting for it lol
[0:13:13] Somanie: Pika was instantly murdering those totems when he was doing shuffs on stream
[0:13:23] Roundhere_: they know the link is coming too its like its a random thing to press
[0:13:28] shroomagi: Has there ever been any confirmed case of cheating during AWC ever?
[0:13:34] gjvl: IM SO HAPPY YOURE BACK I MISSED YOU
[0:13:39] Vramii: did jelly play at all yesterday?
[0:13:44] michaelbigdam: there are some good addons to make totem frames really big not hard to click and insta kill
[0:13:55] Aroty: Link should require more than one global to kill?
[0:13:59] figurines: yeah but your "theory" versus reality. We haven't seen it before and there are lots of skilled clickers in the world of warcraft. And also wiz isn't doing it on his stream leading up to tourney all season. So it's fine to questions WTF is happening and kinda disingenous to say "just a clicker"
[0:14:16] lem_00: bring your sub rogue out
[0:14:39] bollskis: also the link kill was a throw lol
[0:14:45] figurines: I'm sure we will see it a lot then in the coming weeks as more people realize its possible. Can't wait to see the clips and be proved wrong :)
[0:14:56] Vramii: @aroty I agree. such a big CD dying that fast is like when you could purge bust from fire. not fun to have big cd negated so fast
[0:14:59] stickywoods: great job casting
[0:15:00] dougdimaddome: @figurines then go watch the clips? lol
[0:15:00] falapala: it happens to dew on stream all the time
[0:15:01] Aroty: Are you gonna find a rogue to play ww/sub with?
[0:15:05] metajutsu: @figurines realize its possible? is this a troll
[0:15:06] stickywoods: per usual
[0:15:12] Jazzarus_: people are just mad their team lost LUL
[0:15:32] squarepusher_: Guys, even cdew was defending wiz.
[0:15:35] bollskis: liquid won that game lol
[0:15:41] Vramii: yeah you might be right
[0:15:41] YoMamaSoFine69: is it fun if you ps gets clones or if your dome gets roped
[0:15:42] poroyou: it makes the game deeper, and makes you think about purge protection
[0:15:57] metajutsu: @figurines do you really think top level pvpers havent realized spirit link is able to be instantly killed? you think people are just now realizing this?
[0:15:58] Somanie: No credible person, just a shit ton of chatters yesterday
[0:15:58] Vramii: but link feels so important it’s bigger. maybe I, wrong though
[0:16:01] wyldeshock: A guy with his rep is definitely not cheating.
[0:16:01] figurines: They slo mo'd it for 20 minutes. And freaked out when he did it a second time too. I repeat i hope people realize its possible and do it more in coming weeks.
[0:16:03] zachgamegodx: i think it was just ziqo and supa tease getting too fixated on it in broadcast
[0:16:10] zachgamegodx: so alot of ppl talked about it and convinced themselves
[0:16:13] wyldeshock: these are some of the best players in the world
[0:16:13] carneasada34: I think you guys just really dont fathom how much better and aware these pros are. Samiyam turns bear or stops casting the second a melee gets to 9 yds, they're just nuts because they've played 5 billion hours and see the game differently
[0:16:23] wyldeshock: they know where and when the totem is going down
[0:16:28] jay_the_farmer: the move would never cheat
[0:16:36] Vramii: wizk is not cheating man. no way. he’s just good and other people don’t want to admit a player is so much better than them haha
[0:16:54] zachgamegodx: unless cdew and them were to say they felt cheated i wouldnt buy into it
[0:17:01] metajutsu: can people not just anticipate spirit link coming and spam a totem kill macro keybind?
[0:17:04] zachgamegodx: the best person to judge cheating is your opponents usually
[0:17:07] Blitzylive: Ven omg you gotta tell us your opinions about last world cup yesterday!
[0:17:11] DuckyOnce: goodmorning Ven! Loved the broadcast!
[0:17:13] bollskis: u cant target totems with a macro
[0:17:17] Acurarx: kinda like those fps shooter games when people kill someone before I even see them on the screen
[0:17:18] ion82: I watched the match yesterday. It was hard to see the spirit length. Totem but last night wizk posted his match from that screen and you can clearly see the totem
[0:17:36] themightyroach: so happy for the move man, kinda sad for cdew and liquid because of how much they were dedicated to practice tho
[0:17:50] YoMamaSoFine69: tbh u can even have a mo death macro so its not even 2 clicks just one
[0:17:53] YoMamaSoFine69: ofc its possible
[0:17:56] Aroty: Make a mouse over first ven
[0:18:04] shroomagi: Has there ever been any confirmed cheating in any previous AWC?
[0:18:15] Rob3phones: It didnt help with Supa kept bring up how fast he killed the totem, people fed off that and decided that Wiz must be cheating
[0:18:18] metajutsu: if you know it's coming, it's easy to kill, these tin foil hat ppl have never passed 1800 and saying good players are cheaters
[0:18:21] squarepusher_: How is it so difficult for people to not understand that pro players can't anticipate when and where a link is going to be dropped?
[0:18:29] Airitreya: I kill that crtter *cough* i mean totem every day
[0:18:41] Airitreya: critter*
[0:18:57] Vramii: yeah tbf supa talked about it so much people started questioning it. they still lost that round though hahaha
[0:19:05] jay_the_farmer: all the eu players say jaime kick bots, but i dont think so
[0:19:07] skez_live: Heyy! Morning Ven, nice job this weekend :D
[0:19:27] buffevoker: Frame him
[0:19:30] alvinkada317: you playing hpal?? nice
[0:19:33] marvin1995xo: fifa music ??
[0:19:36] Rob3phones: No not at all just how hyped he was and the energy he had about the sick play fed in to the delusion that Wiz is cheating
[0:19:36] Vramii: not really  he just framed it like he didn’t understand how it could happen that fast
[0:19:43] skez_live: haha
[0:19:46] skez_live: what is it now?>
[0:19:48] alvinkada317: hansol and palumor l00l
[0:19:51] dooshken: @Vramii who?
[0:19:52] Rob3phones: Not trying to say Supa was saying Wiz was cheating
[0:19:57] Vramii: supa
[0:19:58] hooqs: they gonna take it home next cup fr
[0:20:02] dooshken: ah
[0:20:05] lem_00: its crusader yelling at everyone to run away
[0:20:06] dooshken: Cdew was cool with it
[0:20:08] Stoichulk: I hated supatease castings, wish you would have got to cast all the games.
[0:20:12] dooshken: People are trying to get drama form nothing
[0:20:17] Veyronn_00: Im amazed people are desperate enough to play with Crusader
[0:20:17] skez_live: hes gonna talk so much shit about his team regardless if they are good or not lol
[0:20:23] Somanie: Avril???
[0:20:25] alvinkada317: is rogue/mage even good with hpal? probably not idk
[0:20:29] joyrex_j9: the casting hard carries AWC
[0:20:31] Somanie: catJAM
[0:20:32] joyrex_j9: you guys are amazing
[0:20:35] VetisBR: crusader yelling  non stop and then yelling at teammates for not communicating is the best
[0:20:35] Vramii: he never said he cheated he was just so dumbfounded by it that regular people started jumping to conclusions
[0:20:39] marvin1995xo: shes from canada so yea
[0:20:40] Lythi: morning Ven!
[0:20:40] jag_pvp: you all did great casting
[0:20:41] Magottx: Omg thank god. Twitch is so boring without your stream.
[0:20:45] Stoichulk: Sounds like an auctioneer and it's too fake hype for me
[0:21:01] Lythi: doing good, just finished up work! excited to queue some shuffle on my lock
[0:21:03] Aroty: I'm not good enough to catch all the things the casters cover in games
[0:21:04] Magottx: Been so spoiled with your ruki after darks and weekend rukis lately
[0:21:07] skez_live: the EU games were sooooo good
[0:21:07] Luigicamp: good morning! Who won?
[0:21:09] wyldeshock: one of hte best weekends for awc i've seen
[0:21:14] Extramediums: Honestly, the entire 'situation' with accusations against wizk can be cleared up by him posting his recording of it. I absolutely would expect players to be recording their AWC matches for them to review after it's done.
[0:21:22] skez_live: I enjoyed watching the move too, but watching Hoolibang was so sick
[0:21:22] kusoneko: im sad theres only 2 AWC weeks Sadge
[0:21:24] Magottx: I was watching but it’s not quite the same
[0:21:28] themightyroach: lot of comp variety for once, very pleasant
[0:21:30] Zeniticon: ww is so op :D
[0:21:38] Vramii: I miss brain playing
[0:21:38] Lythi: great casts from you guys this weekend btw, really enjoyed it
[0:21:39] Luigicamp: nice
[0:21:42] jay_the_farmer: do u think we will see more ww now?
[0:21:46] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:21:48] Lythi: pikabooMove  didnt doubt them for a second
[0:21:54] zachgamegodx: they werent a 1 trick really they had tons more cleave to run with fuseton
[0:21:54] dooshken: Sterge's stream last night was insane
[0:21:57] zachgamegodx: i mean elswave
[0:21:58] Lythi: we´ll see a lot more Warrior in EU
[0:21:58] zachgamegodx: *
[0:21:58] yo_shame: sterge and dew both played crazy
[0:21:59] Magottx: The DH arms was so cool for EU. I like how they just played defensive with big goes
[0:22:04] Somanie: What's happening next weekend
[0:22:06] nikthevoker: i want to see the no name NA arc like EU LUL
[0:22:09] Vramii: we see two WW. ow in this shuffle hahaha
[0:22:33] themightyroach: eu vs na ?
[0:22:36] Somanie: A second series like what we had this weekend?
[0:22:42] marvin1995xo: @themightyroach ya think so
[0:22:44] Lythi: gl hf!
[0:22:50] Jihnn: Retribuki is not stupid BibleThump
[0:22:53] yo_shame: hpal is a LOT of fun
[0:22:58] Lythi: i´m trying to get out of the 1.6k hardstuck on literally anything LUL
[0:23:03] Extramediums: I mean, it's not rare to see WW's in shuffle, not like they're awful or something.
[0:23:14] Extramediums: oh look, all nelf
[0:24:05] heymomimonttv: lol 2 ww in 1 lobby, havent seen that in a season or two
[0:24:09] primejusticegaming: yooo what up ven
[0:24:38] dooshken: Casting last night was great
[0:24:43] aultymalganis: morning ven
[0:24:56] Lythi: dude took out the christmas lights again
[0:24:57] dooshken: I'm not a fan of supa but he is definitely a good caster. He really cares about the game
[0:25:09] tea_berri: the swifty def macro LUL
[0:25:14] alvinkada317: blackout kick actually can hit harder than rsk it’s disgusting
[0:25:29] leeka: the burst
[0:25:30] marvin1995xo: yes and outlaw
[0:25:31] ezmoney3434: you still running hand of divinity?
[0:25:33] DrunkJoe14: rukiOld
[0:25:35] GaryNec: ww is broken
[0:25:35] carneasada34: The damage is pretty nutty
[0:25:36] marvin1995xo: and shadow priest
[0:25:36] Saiyori: i played 1 to 1800 for the first time this season, enjoyed it
[0:25:39] dooshken: That EU windwalker was PUMPING
[0:25:39] yo_shame: ww can kind of face tank too much now
[0:25:39] CJacks: What do you think of Holy priests in PvP?
[0:25:40] Spaceberry_McDuck: i think they're more dangerous at low levels
[0:25:42] doclovejr: no
[0:25:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Windwalker can do crazy things, 300K rising sun kicks
[0:25:43] carneasada34: but they die if theyre not smart
[0:25:46] zachgamegodx: no, sub rogue enabled the ww
[0:25:46] Adolescents77: most people would play ww and die instantly
[0:25:49] alvinkada317: they get hard counter by mages & hunters
[0:25:49] yo_shame: if sub is bad ww is good
[0:25:52] dooshken: Yea
[0:25:54] rekt1370: wouldn't say broken cause it was only working with that sub rogue and they had to play insane ot make it happen
[0:25:55] kusoneko: i never had problems vs ww, but im also not r1
[0:26:04] Vramii: one real WW monk in the tourney and people complain about that instead of the 10000 dh and rogues haha
[0:26:05] bigsockets: ww is a little too tanky. fine otherwise its supposed to be glass cannon
[0:26:09] flyingorangee: typical sub makes go for ww monk but nerf the monk KEKW
[0:26:23] zachgamegodx: ww is like michael myers, you can just keep running until he dies in a supernatural event
[0:27:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: There was more than one windwalker in AWC over the weekend, but Hoolibang wrecking EU definitely brought it attention
[0:27:23] rekt1370: yea hoolibang only team that won with a ww

[0:28:06] Applezbtw: ww monk*
[0:28:27] Somanie: Karmakarmakarmakarmakarma-karmeeeeeleon
[0:28:29] tea_berri: @Applezbtw its up there when ur into casters for sure
[0:28:44] alvinkada317: run barrier of faith, single glimmer & hand of divinity. it’s low key op
[0:28:45] nikthevoker: @venruki do you want the druid hot WA, shows total druid hot healing on side of gladius frame? great for shuffle switches/no comms
[0:28:49] wyldeshock: i think SS q's have inspired more people to play healer. could be wrong
[0:28:51] ezmoney3434: WW cranks but like you guys said in the AWC you have to have a rogue help you keep the kill target locked down and you can’t be cc’ed because serenity is easy to CC
[0:29:02] rekt1370: KEKW
[0:29:09] nikthevoker: its sooo good
[0:29:16] shugguls: loved it
[0:29:16] kusoneko: check him pc
[0:29:21] ezmoney3434: wiz is a monster

[0:29:22] bollskis: cracked
[0:29:24] Vramii: he’s the best sp in the world
[0:29:24] rekt1370: hoolibang won because their coordination was insane almost every setup they were all cced
[0:29:25] dooshken: More the rogue's fault?
[0:29:28] leeka: that pvp talent lets him pump SWP
[0:29:29] marvin1995xo: nope ur wrong
[0:29:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wizk definitely made shadow priest look OP
[0:29:35] Extramediums: @venruki You need the following title, because when other healers can't keep the team mates up, you can. "Venruki the Fluffer"
[0:29:36] Lythi: wizk is just that good, he always has been and pika is a real bro, minmaxing the spotlight for wizk
[0:29:41] ezmoney3434: yeah you gotta have a rogue almost for the WW to shine
[0:29:43] rekt1370: yea watch wizk without a rogue its different story LUL
[0:29:46] Adolescents77: chatharsis and set bonus
[0:29:48] carneasada34: wiz admitted that on stream that pika unlocks his ability to do anything
[0:30:02] dooshken: @Lythi Not like he has a choice haha. Best way for them to play
[0:30:23] Magottx: Cloak immunity is annoying me so much more than anything in the game. Perma blades cherry on top
[0:30:33] siignasty: Good God I loved watching Hoolibang games...I heard Windwalker and that's what popped in my head.
[0:30:44] xoHOLLOW: i think rogue is just good at enabling their teammates to do dmg like we saw with the EU ww/rogue team
[0:30:45] yo_shame: too much quick cc in the game (rogues are big offenders) enable a lot of damage from certain classes, and EU figured out ww can do that with a rogue too
[0:30:53] reedthesham: pre bubble the beam, is this Borngood?
[0:30:55] rekt1370: yea rogues are just busted
[0:31:07] rekt1370: gotta pre freedom the beam

[0:32:00] xoHOLLOW: @nikthevoker thank u. also played vs your boomy/dev in 3's yesterday. you are scary asf
[0:32:10] Vramii: pika does way less damage than trill but he’s doing way more on the cc side to enable wizk
[0:32:11] dooshken: "Wizk admitted" Like he was keeping it a secret haha
[0:32:43] nikthevoker: i just play whatever in LFG LUL

[0:33:46] marvin1995xo: sp is just  op
[0:33:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Forum post! LUL
[0:33:50] ungodlyxdx: where do you think the 20k viewership peak came from on the WC chanel?
[0:33:52] Extramediums: Honestly, the entire 'situation' with accusations against wizk can be cleared up by him posting his recording of it. I absolutely would expect players to be recording their AWC matches for them to review after it's done.
[0:33:58] rekt1370: people really acting like its hard to kill link fast specially if you know its about to come LUL
[0:34:03] dooshken: I posted on the forums guys BatChest
[0:34:13] zachgamegodx: i dont blame ppl, the way the commentators dwelled on it and ziqo said they need to check his..grocery list
[0:34:23] What_ln_Tarnation: he should take it as a compliment if he didnt cheat
[0:34:23] JohanSolo_TV: wizk taking steroids confirmed. he's freakin jacked behind that computer screen
[0:34:24] zachgamegodx: i dont think it was
[0:34:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mysterious link disappearance was something, sure
[0:34:32] GnRHDota2: @rekt1370 even before first tick? thats pretty much impossible
[0:34:41] unysub: the amount of people clowning on pikaboo was crazy
[0:34:43] rekt1370: put your mouse spam button
[0:34:47] rekt1370: its one gcd to kill it
[0:34:58] siignasty: Pretty much impossible still implies possibility lol
[0:35:00] dooshken: Crazy how people are dwelling on the link kill when Cdew legit said he doesn't even care. And they won that game lmao
[0:35:00] panjack13: Is it possible to have a macro that does that and he anticipated it well?
[0:35:01] rekt1370: and they also can have weak auras that make the bar huge
[0:35:06] DuckyOnce: are you again going to watch party the games on wednesday?
[0:35:16] GnRHDota2: @panjack13 no
[0:35:35] unysub: @panjack13 you can have mouseover macros but not any that can target the totems and kill it
[0:36:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: How quick is too quick for killing a spirit link totem?
[0:36:33] wowsuomi: -1
[0:36:36] skez_live: wiz was locked in, fully anticipating the link, likely had a mouseover macro just to spam for it lol
[0:36:37] Sosatko: after seeing the games I think RPS can actually out damp any comp in the game it’s legit immortal
[0:36:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess the link that didn't show up could have been due to server lag
[0:36:42] rekt1370: when you know its coming can be spamming pain mouseover
[0:36:45] Extramediums: @rekt1370 Keep in mind the desync of wow between two players, let alone a third (the spectator tool), so it's completely possible that from wiz/cdew/spec client's perspective, nothing looked the same for any one. I'm in no way defending any thing, but as I've said, easy enough to post a clip from Wiz's perspective. But he didn't stream it. I expect people to be recording their awc matches for review, so wiz can just post it himself.
[0:36:53] SamesPond: how did it go for pika?
[0:36:55] siignasty: Pika said Wizk clicked it and killed it with SW pain. He killed it before Pika could react to it and he also said he was ready for it when he was casting void torrent.
[0:37:10] unysub: @wEiRdO_dUdE the nameplate shows before the animation of the totem comes out of the ground
[0:37:15] Roundhere_: hes not cheating lmao
[0:37:25] dooshken: The burden of proof is on other people who are accusing him of cheating lmao
[0:37:30] rekt1370: yea weakaura for the nameplate spam sw pain mouseover and you know its coming
[0:37:31] dooshken: Wizk has a record if being a great player
[0:37:34] rekt1370: def going to be giga fast
[0:37:41] xoHOLLOW: hes been the best shadow priest since talb retired in mop and people are randomly accusing him of cheating lmao so dumb
[0:37:46] bollskis: lol pro players of every game do fantastical stuff all the time
[0:37:47] Extramediums: he doesn't HAVE to record, but I would absolutely expect awc matches to be recorded by each player to review later to look for efficiencies as a team
[0:37:48] Xeliumimar: ping diff ggs only
[0:37:51] dooshken: @xoHOLLOW ^^
[0:37:57] zachgamegodx: never 0%...can say its unlikely
[0:37:59] bollskis: gonna need proof steph curry isnt cheating when he makes 40 footers pls
[0:38:08] siignasty: Wizk literally knew it was coming and called it in their team coms lol
[0:38:13] xoHOLLOW: its been almost a decade since hes dominated wow arena and people think he decided to cheat out of nowhere when they were already dominating tourneys as RPS
[0:38:23] Applezbtw: steph curry made a full court shot at the buzzer once i reported him for cheating ofc LUL
[0:38:30] SwiisH_Tv: Wiz just one of the best get over it BibleThump
[0:38:32] MurkzyTV: WIZKS skill is unmatched on shadow .
[0:38:34] bollskis: check him blood
[0:38:55] MurkzyTV: Old school talb doesnt compare to todays wizk
[0:39:00] bollskis: lol sik bluff
[0:39:06] xK3V1N4T0Rx: @Applezbtw KEKW
[0:39:23] Lythi: close LUL
[0:39:31] Grissu_: LUL
[0:39:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: We go again!
[0:39:54] Extramediums: The clip that he reviewed from the spec client did look strange, and the explanation of of it didn't really go over anything other than "I'm off global here channeling torrent half way, then I kill it".  I don't want to support hackusations, but doing that consistently multiple times before it even ticks can raise some suspicions for his opponents/viewers
[0:40:01] wowsuomi: Talb used to do some pretty crazy fast ms's on his teammates cc
[0:40:10] wowsuomi: Md's
[0:40:29] alvinkada317: did the link animation not even go off ?
[0:40:31] rekt1370: was obvious that he was going to link
[0:40:41] Xeliumimar: kinda sus ngl
[0:40:43] Extramediums: pre-mding something is very different than this example though
[0:40:48] unysub: cdew trinks and runs towards sam
[0:40:52] marvin1995xo: can u spam a macro or so ?
[0:40:55] azliaris1: "it's obvious" like any human can react that fast lol
[0:40:57] rekt1370: that weakaura popped up big LUL
[0:40:57] kusoneko: its definitely sus
[0:40:59] ralvich: @extramediums he has a weak aura that makes the frame giant + a mouse over macro. he’s also the best spriest in the game. what’s so unbelievable about killing a link fast with that in mind?
[0:41:04] lefteemd: its the only major cd he has to save someone, think its pretty normal to be expecting the link
[0:41:07] DouzySham: https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyPolishedBorkPermaSmug-OOlmUlksReO-lrLX
[0:41:10] pharmztko: totem nameplate prolly took up the whole screen
[0:41:10] aaggros: You arent supposed to be able to macro target totems
[0:41:11] unysub: @azliaris1 the nameplate shows before the totem animation
[0:41:11] Applezbtw: i mean the sham is running toward his teamate at 10% health what button do you think cdew is gonna press LUL
[0:41:14] dougdimaddome: @azliaris1 but you don't need to react that fact lol

[0:42:25] What_ln_Tarnation: @rekt1370 wouldnt he also need to have cursor on same spot where totem gets dropped?

[0:43:21] zachgamegodx: shaman priest and outlaw all got buffed right before the cup, not surprised they won
[0:43:26] rekt1370: the weakaura can make the nameplate big and make it easy to kill tho
[0:43:26] Extramediums: @Roundhere_ but it can make a massive clickable nameplate that's easy to click
[0:43:29] chinchin23: whaazz not make the finals was  a shocker as well

[0:44:04] DouzySham: @carrvve the totem nameplate shows up like half a second before the animation, its a really slow animation
[0:44:15] GaryNec: I wish i could resub :/
[0:44:25] toljar: aight I'll hop in, sec
[0:44:28] TINSTAAFL: awc was so good this season imo
[0:44:36] rekt1370: was sw pain so hes spamming the mouseover
[0:44:38] aaggros: are you able to death while channeling void torrent?
[0:44:41] unysub: the tic part is kinda just luck
[0:44:43] rekt1370: and weak aura pops up before the totem really shows
[0:44:43] jmonttheking: @venruki wiz created a clip on his page for all the people wondering how it was done and his thought process

[0:44:56] Nikademous: That's why their pros and we sit at home and wat h them
[0:44:57] DouzySham: @aaggros it was swp, and yes you can spam it while channeling
[0:44:59] Extramediums: @Nikademous blindly believing everything without sufficient evidence is a big problem in anything competitive. I am on neither side of the argument, and I see the reasonable points that either side makes, and the absolutely unreasonable points that people make for either side.
[0:45:07] Applezbtw: i mean these are the type of plays you would expect from the people competeing the championship lol not some 1500  trashcans that dont kill totems in solo shuffle
[0:45:12] wowsuomi: I did it once
[0:45:15] Sosatko: I think it’s funny how everyone cries about Druid and it was holy priest / rsham that won xd

[0:45:21] toljar: try again was loggin in
[0:45:21] Nikademous: I just feel like ppl are to quick to claim cheater now

[0:45:41] Sosatko: definitely but didn’t win
[0:45:42] Extramediums: @CasShenkt What kinda useless response is that to a valid statement?
[0:45:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, a lot of rdruids and their sneaky drinks

[0:46:07] Sosatko: holy pally meta is boring as shit to just infinite cd trades
[0:46:14] bollskis: lul
[0:46:17] pharmztko: totem down 1 sec before circle comes out lol
[0:46:24] carneasada34: how can i reset the cd now

[0:46:49] skez_live: I agree i was really glad to see no r-druid comp won
[0:46:50] Extramediums: @CasShenkt And then following up with a statement that is so pathetically weak, but attempts to make fun of people that have ASD? Class act
[0:46:51] zachgamegodx: ven loves playing mld why would he have bias
[0:47:00] Ronn_Deezy: as a spectator only the lamest of the lame is when the game just comes down to who got a drink off

[0:47:09] wyldeshock: i would have liked to see a Stadman appearance
[0:47:11] Nimrod_cx: @venruki do you have an addon or something to show the icon of the totems above their nameplate?
[0:47:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've said it for quite awhile that rdruid needs to be able to do some dam, like resto shamans and their lava bursts. Them doing clones is just meh
[0:47:42] carrvve: what kind of change would you like to see to cyclone @venruki
[0:47:43] Nikademous: Yea @casshenkt this an L bro, having competent discussions is fun and how you learn. Enough insulting my guy.
[0:47:59] rekt1370: make it dispelable
[0:48:02] Sosatko: my little AI healers 😂
[0:48:04] alvinkada317: make it shorter range
[0:48:06] Bigmoran: Knock 1 second off
[0:48:21] CasShenkt: Dude prints out a manifesto, how is that discussion? its a-word.
[0:48:21] jmonttheking: make it dispellable makes the most sense
[0:48:22] chinchin23: rogues need a nerf way to much cc for one class
[0:48:24] VenoFrog: make feral not dependent on casting clone
[0:48:29] lowenergyjeb_: ya the rdruid does not need fast clone
[0:48:33] alvinkada317: polymorph can be cast in like 0.2 seconds lol
[0:48:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: That tree form blasting out some starsurges would be cooler
[0:48:39] aaggros: When have rogues not needed a nerf?
[0:48:40] ionlyplaymetas: so when do you think that we're going to see The move get their wins vacated for wizk blatantly botting
[0:48:41] Voriq: DH Imprison is the same thing i don't see people talk about that lol
[0:48:52] Lythi: i mean, what is the main issue with cyclone?
[0:48:56] aaggros: Imprison has a long cd
[0:49:01] pharmztko: wow fast for boomer.!! ruki1D
[0:49:01] aaggros: not even close to the same
[0:49:03] alvinkada317: not true
[0:49:04] kusoneko: huh
[0:49:07] Extramediums: @wEiRdO_dUdE I've seen a few druids playing offensively in boomkin form with HOTW. Obviously not as popular as the healbot/clone spam rdruid, but in a different, less zug zug meta with health bars being damn near binary, it might have a place
[0:49:16] diosilvl: it does if u're expecting a @player
[0:49:17] y0hansson: Did cdew say anything?
[0:49:19] wyldeshock: it could have a small cd maybe
[0:49:22] rekt1370: main issue can spam clone on the whole team one after each other and they have to sit it LUL
[0:49:23] Six_awc: Wiz said his nameplate for SLT was super big too
[0:49:30] Voriq: Give clone a 25sec cd LUL
[0:49:37] ByeAndai: How would you change clone if you could?
[0:49:40] bigsockets: if clone had a 5 sec cd you could outplay it but its still strong
[0:49:49] jadora: cyclones been an issue for 15 years. never changed never will
[0:49:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: They buffed master shapeshifter to try to encourage rdruid to do dam in boomkin but it's not really enough for the high end
[0:50:02] Extramediums: @CasShenkt It's rather funny that you see two sentences together and you lose your mind about it being a 'manifesto'.
[0:50:03] Vramii: clone should last 4 seconds and dr with stuns
[0:50:05] primejusticegaming: @Voriq this without changing kidney shot is absolutely idiotic
[0:50:06] rekt1370: make it dispel able and it would still be the best
[0:50:06] Swiv: that cyclone spam from Sam was out of control
[0:50:08] Adolescents77: the problem is you can't dispel clone
[0:50:09] lem_00: i wish they brought relentless trinket back for cyclones
[0:50:10] higanheim: being called a cheater is one of the highest compliments
[0:50:13] bollskis: when clone lasts longer than i do NotLikeThis
[0:50:14] Unarmd: make it dispelable?
[0:50:15] toljar: Make clone a big damage shield instead of a complete immune, if it is going to have fast cast/spammable with poly timer, imo
[0:50:16] skez_live: I honestly just wish it had a CD, its too powerful to be spammable
[0:50:18] phanabananana: remember when cyclone gave a damage and healing debuff lol
[0:50:18] Endoraesh: @venruki which healer you prefer this season between hpal and disc priest?
[0:50:18] aurelioristv: When was it changed btw? I don't remember hotw clones in s2
[0:50:22] Lythi: so its not the CC itself or the fact that its undispellable (except MD) but just the amount of times you get cycloned feels incredibly high because there is no way to break out of one.
[0:50:22] Sosatko: Clone is def to OP
[0:50:25] heymomimonttv: @bollskis kekw same
[0:50:32] tea_berri: its a pro player link is pretty high prio i think he was lookin for it and was ready
[0:50:34] Somanie: goal in life is to karaoke this song and perform only the linkin park parts
[0:50:37] Sosatko: It beats the micro unavoidable cc tho
[0:50:42] Badasti: yooo, welcome back Ven
[0:50:42] primejusticegaming: having a 15 second cd might be more appropriate
[0:50:44] rekt1370: certain specs are so easy to clone also
[0:50:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Awesome!
[0:50:55] higanheim: lets gooo
[0:50:55] Somanie: !discord 👀
[0:50:56] Nightbot: Join the official Venruki Discord: https://discord.gg/SGNHyz3Mah
[0:50:56] Vramii: increase clone cast time by 1 sec
[0:51:01] markaimfire_: You did a great job last night Ven
[0:51:03] pharmztko: hi YouTube
[0:51:29] Lythi: basically leads me to believe that you find a way to reduce clone uptime, be it through dispell, cd on the spell or a cd on the spell PrideShrug
[0:51:45] zachgamegodx: youtube voice is on
[0:51:46] Lythi: who would´ve guessed that RMP is the best comp in the game LUL
[0:51:53] DougyfreshGG: rogue was sub too right?
[0:51:56] alvinkada317: i’m surprised about holy priest but not ww
[0:52:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Them taking down Echo was a shocker to me
[0:52:12] Badasti: warriors poor indie class LUL
[0:52:13] aaggros: the war dh team was really good
[0:52:19] reedthesham: Not just any RMD
[0:52:28] alvinkada317: we love to see it
[0:52:30] mayonaes: Finally started playing Arcane mage and it may just be the most fun I have ever had
[0:52:31] Boruox: yup not just any RMD
[0:52:34] kornystreamz: cleaves are just too strong
[0:52:47] zibnub: Sterge's static was godly
[0:52:55] aurelioristv: resto shaman getting to 10-12 minutes without drinking is kinda nuts
[0:52:56] Badasti: so happy TM won
[0:53:05] SNAKEBOMBS22: did liquid win?
[0:53:05] heymomimonttv: seeing sterge and cdew both get to play  their main healers was heartwarming
[0:53:16] bobbybigbuxx: hey Ven, you did great yesterday, thank you for your service!
[0:53:22] Lythi: funnily enough the best Rsham play we saw yesterday was Lontar jakbTHINK
[0:53:32] bigsockets: sub rogue crushes DH though
[0:53:36] ionlyplaymetas: cdew and trill both didnt "say anything" but very heavily leaned into "yea 1 series he was just doing 80k and the next he was at 160k, i guess he just got a lot better overnight even tho we were doing the same amount of clones and stuns" kekw and this was the 1 series wizk decides not to stream. Sus to say the least, blatant in my opinion
[0:53:47] aaggros: need to bring back hunters countering rogues
[0:53:48] jmetz75: NA finals was FIRE
[0:54:13] Grissu_: no ret as always Sadge
[0:54:17] pragma90: @ionlyplaymetas you think wizk would cheat for 1250 dollars? lol
[0:54:19] Lythi: yeah, they were the only ones
[0:54:25] gelatokush: rat played sub too
[0:54:26] alvinkada317: outlaw > sub
[0:54:37] aurelioristv: some players in the qualifiers played sub ww as well, that team wasn't the only one qing the comp
[0:54:42] ionlyplaymetas: @pragma90 wizk is a known ddoser bruh, hes cheated before for $0
[0:54:45] zachgamegodx: we saw tsg once
[0:54:47] alexhomie: casterweavers op
[0:54:54] Badasti: Wizk such a big pumper
[0:54:57] carneasada34: @ionlyplaymetas Absterge touched on this, and said that they changed their tune to wait for the little things like 2 second clones to maximize kill efforts
[0:55:04] TINSTAAFL: liquid always casts suspicion when they lose.
[0:55:15] jmetz75: I loved your question for Absterge, I feel like all the multi classing on SS from The MOVE will pay off big time
[0:55:19] Xenon_cl: how is a hpriest > hpally..what have u done blizz
[0:55:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Unholy survivability is sus
[0:55:25] jmetz75: @ionlyplaymetas lol, BS
[0:55:30] gelatokush: surprised we didnt see one ret pally
[0:55:36] gulcracko: idk about any cheating but do we know how Wiz killed a spirit link totem before it even healed?
[0:55:38] cyborg1141: I'm not
[0:55:50] Lythi: @gulcracko sniping it with Pain
[0:56:09] ionlyplaymetas: @carneasada34 oh so waiting 2 seconds doubles a players dps overnight lol and lets them kill SLT before they have even pixel'd into the game
[0:56:12] Sosatko: its immortal
[0:56:17] Badasti: Wizk is a miracle worker though
[0:56:18] wackpoetic: can you not use a macro to target Spirit Link?
[0:56:20] sixthycent: samiyam prolly get gis back out
[0:56:34] wyldeshock: it looked good bc the best rps played rps
[0:56:36] Zerksyera: hunter needs a buff
[0:56:43] kornystreamz: ofc no affi too weak
[0:56:51] aurelioristv: the buffs were pretty insane last patch
[0:56:54] kornystreamz: affi so strong yet so weak :(
[0:56:56] QwQGolden: the awc chat was so fkin fried when Wizk was outplaying, 'He is miles better than me must be cheating reeeee' holy fuck
[0:56:56] chubmax: aff is a dumpster fire
[0:56:57] ionlyplaymetas: @jmetz75 yes he is a known ddoser
[0:56:57] Lythi: we saw a bunch of hpriest in open bracket ye
[0:57:23] sixthycent: yea meep made top5 with mw
[0:57:27] marvin1995xo: outlaw sahdow priest and ww monk , dh could need some nerf imo
[0:57:27] sixthycent: oh in NA
[0:57:30] jmetz75: LIQUID played with a gimmicky pve weapon, such bs
[0:57:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: A few more rogues in NA LUL
[0:57:58] marvin1995xo: void
[0:57:59] seaent: draco cleave
[0:57:59] gelatokush: dorito
[0:58:03] rockxtv: f-tier
[0:58:03] cyborg1141: Let's make frost dk a hard counter
[0:58:05] ElJackmanno: The guy who won, right? or
[0:58:05] Xenon_cl: didnt drake play one
[0:58:06] alvinkada317: meep
[0:58:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Dorito and Chunli
[0:58:34] Somanie: I need some sources for these ppl saying Wizk is a known ddoser
[0:58:37] alvinkada317: draco got destroyed
[0:58:56] chubmax: world of roguecraft
[0:59:01] twinbladeuk: 0 Ret Sadge
[0:59:02] cyborg1141: How big was mana ? Big totems
[0:59:02] phanabananana: Wayyy too much Ret reprensentation, need immediate nerfs
[0:59:11] shefcurrywristaction: raiku
[0:59:14] shefcurrywristaction: played arcane
[0:59:23] heymomimonttv: @Somanie dudes name is "i only play meta" is prob all u need lol
[0:59:27] alvinkada317: no enhance );
[0:59:30] QwQGolden: war / intervene into sub / ww absolutely destroys it. dont think we will see it again.
[0:59:36] tea_berri: kubzy was insane on arcane
[0:59:39] bigsockets: im kinda surprised we didnt see anyone pull out the bdk lol
[0:59:44] Somanie: @heymomimonttv tru
[0:59:58] shugguls: wonder if they nurfed DH and outlaw/sub how much all the other melee will rise or will they all go ww
[1:00:00] cyborg1141: Arcades great if I don't have to heal it
[1:00:03] Magottx: Ive been saying since patch day spriest was OP
[1:00:04] falapala: Raiku was saying he was lagging too bad for arcane
[1:00:04] bollskis: PROPAGANDAH
[1:00:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Arcane was better on the ladder, yeah
[1:00:04] QwQGolden: lets talk about rifts
[1:00:04] cyborg1141: Arcane*
[1:00:07] GnRHDota2: same as unholy dk
[1:00:09] marvin1995xo: only cause other casters got buff
[1:00:10] alvinkada317: bdk/arms 😭 @bigsockets
[1:00:11] jmetz75: Well, everyone said Rduid was OP, and by AWC it clearly is not
[1:00:14] Badasti: I never thought Arcane was as good as people made it out to be
[1:00:21] wyldeshock: im just now playing mage for about the 1st time ever and it's actually super fun
[1:00:21] chubmax: tourney play in no way relates to ladder tho it shouldnt be taken in the same context at all.
[1:00:31] ionlyplaymetas: @heymomimonttv its a call of duty tag bruh, go ask anyone who played against the dude in mop and legion in RBGs at R1. hes scummy as fuck and a ton of the community doesnt play with him anymore because of that
[1:00:42] sentenced94: the arcane mages pet (rogue) has to get some nerfs though
[1:00:55] alvinkada317: resto shaman lava burst hits really hard now
[1:00:57] seaent: the static field totem is so game changing
[1:01:12] Somanie: @ionlyplaymetas your source is urging us to go find people he happened to play against a decade ago?
[1:01:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those static plays were huge
[1:01:21] Somanie: ok
[1:01:33] bobbybigbuxx: how can they nerf rogues? they don't really do very much dmg, so that means they need to change their CC abilities? What would you change???
[1:01:35] Hobblefoot: Would you like to see Outlaw nerfed after this?
[1:01:36] Moobot: Latest video "The Casual PvP Community Is Begging For Help" view it here: youtu.be/ztKSy4IjNfo
[1:01:37] shugguls: warrior was a suprise
[1:01:39] toljar: Static with proj is my fave combo right now
[1:01:46] wackpoetic: Good morning chat :)
[1:01:50] twinbladeuk: @venruki can u link tweet pls
[1:01:57] Somanie: wouldn't someone get perma banned for ddosing anyway? probably banned from AWC as well? like use your brains
[1:02:00] venruki: https://twitter.com/MysticalTheMonk/status/1754519029115437327
[1:02:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: No rets surprised me
[1:02:11] shugguls: no dh ele
[1:02:14] aaggros: im surprised that trill didnt try sub
[1:02:17] cyborg1141: Static is fun to use shoot them with burrow and static them to the edge fun fun
[1:02:17] Satedtv: Demo lock
[1:02:19] Grimey_George: dh/boomkin
[1:02:19] Badasti: I expected more Dev with that burst
[1:02:20] AkioneDK: buff dk deffence
[1:02:21] kreyzy8: I thought RMD would be better
[1:02:22] xoHOLLOW: no fury warriors, they own me in battlegrounds
[1:02:22] bigsockets: double dh tbh
[1:02:25] higanheim: were there any ele/outlaw
[1:02:30] Hobblefoot: I was surprised that Outlaw damage was so low.  But their ability to peel so well seemed to be a far bigger factor.
[1:02:31] Gnarbariann: Demo
[1:02:35] allenlondon210: ret/war
[1:02:52] hulkdieselx: i noticed chan/raiku/londar went and started practicing MLD right after the tourny lol
[1:02:54] seaent: no blood dk/brewmaster
[1:02:55] ionlyplaymetas: but sure pretend a player can double their dps overnight "naturally" while taking the same amount of cc in both series lol the amount of cope is insane. Banned for DDOS? you obviously didnt play back before discord was a thing. Ddosing was used by everyone who had your skype account
[1:02:59] plebcake_: I expected a jungle to do well, since RPS/RMX
[1:03:04] allosear: Wizards have slow peel @venruki That's the problem usually
[1:03:14] chubmax: no reason to play wizards that have to cast
[1:03:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Feral seems soooo squishy
[1:03:21] flandrs: I want to see hunters be good for once
[1:03:34] loldeepee: no ret pally
[1:03:36] shugguls: hoping for changes tomorrow
[1:03:41] swellows123: Do people get any money for winning cup 1?
[1:03:43] bobbybigbuxx: there is no chance they will do any balancing besides maybe increasing healing
[1:03:44] Popwings: gold times when we see some ret comps at AWC
[1:03:47] chubmax: no one plays demo bc you have to sit there and hard cast everything into rogues/dh/dks etc
[1:03:48] cyborg1141: I haven't seen a survival hunter in 84 qs
[1:03:54] QwQGolden: Can we all admit Jaylis interview was wholesome af
[1:03:55] Vramii: I thought me might see a few more sneaky dev evokes
[1:04:04] SweatyDaniels: SweatyDaniels subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! THE MOVE
[1:04:04] Kineticlol: What race is everyone going for rdruid?
[1:04:05] pragma90: @ionlyplaymetas ddosing used by everyone... you even said it, no one cares about what people did 8 years ago in a bracket that no one cares about
[1:04:08] trx1017: i expected Jellybeans atleast 1 game :(
[1:04:18] wowsuomi: Would those comps crush on ladder
[1:04:19] Hobblefoot: I would love love to see some kind of tweek to Survival Hunter. It is so fun to play and it would be nice to see other options besides rogue.
[1:04:29] cyborg1141: Prob night elf for fade druids maybe
[1:04:30] zachgamegodx: what did u think was the most impressive team
[1:04:30] Boruox: pikabooMove
[1:04:38] Badasti: so glad TM won, and by playing so aggressive. I wish we'd have seen something other than Rogues for a change but really enjoyed it
[1:04:40] gulcracko: Ven, idk if this is something you could tell production but the CD tracker was very bugged this tourny. I saw DH Meta not going on cd, Hpriest Guardian showing a 3 min cd when it wasn’t consumed, Blur didn’t go on cd and more
[1:04:40] hotshotss11: You and all the casters did a great job! Nice work!
[1:04:47] swellows123: Do you think if WoW had even 50% of Fortnite's earnings it would be more competitive?
[1:04:51] lem_00: want to heal 3v3?
[1:04:52] reaperz14: HOOLIBANG
[1:04:56] Vramii: gotta be the eu winner because no one expected it
[1:04:58] brendleton96: in your opinion what do you think the best tbh comp would be for pushing 2k?
[1:05:06] higanheim: ty for letting us know
[1:05:11] beastnephew3: Ven you were the most impressive of AWC
[1:05:13] marvin1995xo: can you also make gold and purple team markers in the ui ?
[1:05:19] Blitzylive: We'd like to know if you guys got the details meter fixed because Pika said it was broken
[1:05:21] QwQGolden: Tourny realm latency issues will be better also ?
[1:05:23] wraithchill: every dk just fell over 🥺
[1:05:25] QwQGolden: hope so
[1:05:30] absterge: hello venruki
[1:05:32] leeka: It was fun to see new faces and new teams
[1:05:37] Gassmask23: @venruki me and some buddies noticed that even though you see alot of boomy dh X on ladder, you dont see it too much in tournament?
[1:05:38] Somanie: @absterge oh shit hey champ
[1:05:40] Vramii: ven help get our guy mystical a team. I want to see him compete.
[1:05:43] xoHOLLOW: @absterge hello champion
[1:05:43] higanheim: lets goo
[1:05:46] SweatyDaniels: stergeRollin stergeRollin stergeRollin
[1:05:52] cyborg1141: Blood elf transmog op
[1:05:59] Somanie: @ionlyplaymetas run your theory past Absterge bro
[1:06:09] Cotton92: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[1:06:10] Somanie: with your chest
[1:06:12] leeka: stergeRollin stergeRollin stergeRollin
[1:06:14] ryanblue98: did you need a r1 title to compete?
[1:06:14] heymomimonttv: @Somanie lmfaoooo i bet dude disappeared once the sterge showed up
[1:06:16] ralvich: stergeRollin stergeRollin stergeRollin
[1:06:20] alvinkada317: dragonflight the xpac of rerllling
[1:06:21] absterge: it is me Dragonflight AWC 2024 season 1 cup 1 champ
[1:06:26] alvinkada317: rerolling
[1:06:26] Vramii: beat the sterge
[1:06:26] jmetz75: those guys play so much WOW lol
[1:06:32] zibnub: stergeMove
[1:06:32] Boruox: stergeMove stergeMove stergeMove
[1:06:43] mikesgrillin: stergeHype stergeHype
[1:06:44] Gnarbariann: That dude dropping f bombs in the interview, then saying sorry and immediately saying it again was pretty funny
[1:06:44] wackpoetic: he IS that guy
[1:06:44] Maaybees: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[1:06:47] ionlyplaymetas: @Somanie pretending like his teammate wouldnt defend him lmao ofc they are going to cover each other, thats how they won, did  you not watch their first series?
[1:06:50] minorheadlines: aww that poor warlock - they are going to be trained out of the match
[1:06:57] xdtai: HOLY SHIT. is that ABSTERGE? the MULTI R1 SHAMAN AND 2024 AWC SEASON 1 CUP 1 CHAMPION FOR TEAM "THE MOVE"??? massive fan.
[1:07:10] tidusisthedream: STERGE TELL DAD I SAID HI AND TY FOR YESTERDAY
[1:07:11] Somanie: @ionlyplaymetas that's not what I said bro, I said run your theory past absterge with your whole chest. don't be afraid
[1:07:18] Boruox: stergeMove stergeMove stergeMove stergeMove stergeMove stergeMove stergeMove
[1:07:30] drfeltgood: @Absterge is a living Big G G.O.D
[1:07:44] ionlyplaymetas: @absterge hey why do you play with a cheater? how did wizk double his dps over night?
[1:07:54] Maaybees: its him the burrow killing meaball throwing static field moving champ @absterge
[1:07:56] ionlyplaymetas: @Somanie am i supposed to be scared lol?
[1:07:59] QwQGolden: @absterge no longer having mariah carey cutout is the biggest falloff no cap fr fr 100p
[1:08:04] drfeltgood: @ionlyplaymetas Stare
[1:08:13] Periphereal: how do you get people who press when youre in CC
[1:08:14] Periphereal: amazing
[1:08:16] SweatyDaniels: biscuits aren't good for your blood sugar
[1:08:20] chubmax: boomies seem like they just flop to arms
[1:08:20] SweatyDaniels: hence the risk
[1:08:36] minorheadlines: I just hate always being the target and feel bitter about it
[1:08:44] panjack13: Destro warlock is a battleship. Just unkillable and insane damage output
[1:08:45] Vaneshaa16: love you falc
[1:08:48] allenlondon210: surprised i didnt see many boomie/rogue teams
[1:08:53] raddx27: on this map too
[1:08:54] drfeltgood: @minorheadlines Totally understandable bud
[1:08:56] absterge: RPS is a very momentum based spec, shaman and SP are like that. we made changes between first series and second series. also he didn’t “double his damage” over night considering we played them the same day and we played a series against kalvish team where he was ramped most games @ionlyplaymetas
[1:08:56] xaarar_the_druid: @chubmax its pain to play boomy vs arms
[1:09:18] absterge: @qwqgolden you don’t watch the stream :( Mariah is there behind me
[1:09:22] nerdyorc_: why do ppl leave shuffles this is soo annoying
[1:09:25] Badasti: @minorheadlines basically anything that wears a dress ends up being a target in arena. You gotta turn your brain off and go melee if you dont want to deal with that
[1:09:41] minorheadlines: @nerdyorc_ oh thats the worst
[1:09:42] Somanie: @absterge he is also very very hung up on Wizk APPARENTLY (without listing any sources) DDoS'ing someone over a decade ago
[1:09:56] QwQGolden: @absterge i'm a confirmed bandwagoner sorry i chat shit boss :(
[1:09:59] minorheadlines: @Badasti 100% - I go ret when I want to feel better
[1:10:15] Lythi: F
[1:10:18] bobbyband0: was 2012 the last year your competed?
[1:10:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomy down
[1:10:19] mrstealyourrating: u mean 0 heals
[1:10:31] drfeltgood: @Absterge pls sire do not acknowledge the simple mind of people like @ionlyplaymetas ... he is not worth the champions time\ nor effort.
[1:10:34] portalpimpx: whats a class/spec that mage mains enjoy
[1:10:37] alvinkada317: this map with a warlock is so annoying
[1:10:38] ionlyplaymetas: @absterge so going from 70-80k in the first series to averaging 130k-160k is just "ramping up" okay from being warm from prior games lol.
[1:10:38] Lancin1987: I heard Monday is the best day to push rating, any idea if it's true?
[1:10:46] Jihnn: Three Amigos BibleThump
[1:10:47] menshika: it was so long ago eh
[1:10:47] Popwings: Three Amigos
[1:11:06] nerdyorc_: 2014 was what? WoD or MoP?
[1:11:07] drfeltgood: @venruki Did any competitive spark flicker when u say that EU WW just messing people up?
[1:11:15] wackpoetic: @absterge how did your teammate do more damage in one game compared to another game? destroyed with FACTS and LOGIC
[1:11:20] biofreaks: anyone want me shadow priest bot? $25 for it message.
[1:11:26] Boruox: @drfeltgood was wondering the same
[1:11:31] raddx27: that was a fun run to watch
[1:11:43] SwiisH_Tv: Has Ziqo or Supa ever competed?
[1:11:52] alvinkada317: big dam judge
[1:12:05] QwQGolden: Tourney realm gear is also better right ? with literally everything available
[1:12:06] ysbear: @venruki where would you rank hpal among the other healers
[1:12:11] drfeltgood: I think Ziqo has i dont think Supa has , He has called Blizzcons, but I could be wrong
[1:12:14] doctjohn: Hey @venruki and chat HeyGuys
[1:12:21] SweatyDaniels: Xaryu could 1v3 Echo
[1:12:29] Badasti: @absterge I actually tried Wizk's spec - I think he cleaves everything with Psychic link right? Hella fun, I want to try it with an Affliction Lock in 3's this week :)
[1:12:36] myodoctor: that boomie has the name john
[1:12:40] SwiisH_Tv: @drfeltgood thats the impression i was under. and then i dont even think Eiya pvps lol
[1:12:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah tournament realm has all the gear available, even the crazy mythic+ and raid stuff
[1:12:50] absterge: if you know how shadow priest functions as a class, yes. “DPS” doesn’t matter you can clearly see the damage at the end of the game
[1:12:51] skez_live: @SweatyDaniels if he remembered how to play retail lol

[1:17:12] SweatyDaniels: @Somanie gotta outcheat the cheaters MonkaS
[1:17:21] drfeltgood: TBH I enjoy Supatease, but the "almost dead" calls were a bit.... over zealous. However I do appreciate the enthusiasm, and he does a far better job at calling matches than I could ever hope to be.

[1:18:06] Razdruid: were you suprised when they went with trill on DH instead of doing dk/rogue
[1:18:06] cyborg1141: I wonder how big the %impact is for winning game one of the shuffle
[1:18:08] bollskis: feels that way
[1:18:36] QwQGolden: @Somanie Is that what you do in Ziqo's absence you menace FeelsStrongMan
[1:18:42] Somanie: would there have been more melee in AWC if more PvP competitors had gotten Fyralath? monkaHmm
[1:18:56] MathematicalWolf: you enjoying paladin the most out of the healers?
[1:18:59] drfeltgood: Would you guys in chat like to see a top 20 Healer/Melee/Caster SS tourney ?

[1:19:19] absterge: @ionlyplaymetas if ur still concerned about the damage I can talk to you privately and explain exactly how it works and why he did so much in the kalvish/2ndliquid series
[1:19:19] zeref_qq: IGNORES OBSERVER 30 SECONDS STILL WIN

[1:20:35] minorheadlines: @aaggros hmm good question -- it is a spell
[1:20:56] aaggros: he had reflect up but it didnt look like it worked
[1:20:58] reel777: blind is physical it can be boped off
[1:21:02] SweatyDaniels: would boomy DH have been a better choice for liquid instead of DK DH? @absterge
[1:21:13] Tnutty: wizk went orc for the dmg buff to his shadowfiend
[1:21:15] zeref_qq: @absterge bro wizz yesterday was killing link totems like flies
[1:21:17] Six_awc: Wizk also wasnt cloned/disarmed half of the time
[1:21:19] minorheadlines: @reel777 he means repentance - thats not physical is it?
[1:21:22] Lythi: wp!
[1:21:23] ReApEr4O1: do you think Wizk cheated?Because there is a big thread on WoW forums, they all think Wizk cheated when he killed the spirit link totem from Cdew instantly, not once but twice.
[1:21:25] Jihnn: EZ
[1:21:26] tron_80: like a deuce laid in the toilet in the night

[1:21:48] marcoalvapaka: Do you miss competing in AWC ven?
[1:21:53] Cvarks: gm
[1:21:54] Somanie: if you watch Pika at all, you'll see how fucking fast they knock those totems
[1:21:55] SweatyDaniels: i mean cant you just make a target spirit link macro and spam it when you think its gonna be dropped?
[1:21:56] Gushingcoom: the 10 people from the arena forums?
[1:21:58] Razdruid: bro nobody understands how insane of a player wizk is
[1:21:58] abruptdecayO_O: he didnt insta kill it every link it was like2 out of 10
[1:22:01] ysbear: @venruki where do you rankj Hpal among hte other healers?
[1:22:01] ayyyrod: when you're that good they think you cheat lmao sheeeesh Wizlord

[1:22:06] CaranoBlaze: Would you consider doing an Hpal guide?
[1:22:07] nightmxz: Wizk clicks frames, you think he doesn't have the accuracy and ability to predict a link and hit it? KEKW
[1:22:08] Jihnn: @SweatyDaniels No, you can't
[1:22:11] pragma90: @absterge that cant be true because it makes too much sense
[1:22:11] ParagonPlayer123: Who won AWC NA
[1:22:11] Somanie: Pika SNIPES totems in shuffles
[1:22:14] DeityRevert: classic reddit
[1:22:17] nightmxz: @Cvarks good morning friend
[1:22:22] Hobblefoot: Wizk is not going to randomly start cheating now on the main stage of the AWC.  What a preposterous thought.
[1:22:25] wreklol: so there's no way that wizk couldn't have had a macro that said /target "spirit link totem" /cast shadow word death, /targetlasttarget?
[1:22:30] ParagonPlayer123: Who won AWC NA?
[1:22:31] Phreshbrew: same people who think he cheated are the same people who get kicked once in shuffle and assume it's a kick bot
[1:22:34] Razdruid: @Hobblefoot this
[1:22:37] abruptdecayO_O: @wreklol cant macro totem targets like that
[1:22:38] aurelioristv: macros to target totems don't work in arena
[1:22:39] Steveleeb: threads claiming he killed it so fast he cheated is such a compliment to wizk
[1:22:40] Kruzx: he prlly just got his prescription filled that day
[1:22:41] absterge: wiz has been top ranked in CS and valorant, and clicks frames so he's very used to mouse accuracy. but this argument is hilarious tbh
[1:22:42] OblivTTV: what classes would you use Yulons Grace into?
[1:22:45] zeref_qq: no i can understand how u can see it coming i was amazed yesterday how fast it went down
[1:22:45] OblivTTV: on monk
[1:22:48] reaperz14: You can't deny its honestly super sus
[1:22:51] minorheadlines: @wreklol I didn't think those macros work in arena
[1:22:55] Maaybees: @absterge do you think sam dies if he hits him with the pain instead of the totem in "the" link kill
[1:22:56] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy CaranoBlaze WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:22:58] Razdruid: KEKW
[1:22:58] cyborg1141: Could definitely have a target totem macro is that cheating ?
[1:23:01] reaperz14: killing it before its even rendered
[1:23:03] Somanie: EXCUSES Madge
[1:23:11] nightmxz: @absterge He might actually have the most apm out of WoW players, unironically when you watch him play his apm is fucking absurd
[1:23:15] Somanie: PERJURY Madge
[1:23:18] absterge: he also streamed in discord to 20 ppl during our games :D
[1:23:19] kingcamps_alot: Anticipation  is an underated skill .he knew link was only option

[1:23:39] zachgamegodx: That monk u reported a few weeks ago for botting his rotationa nd trinkets is back
[1:23:41] skez_live: @absterge i hope he can show a recording of it so these idiots and quiet down
[1:23:43] zachgamegodx: i reported him back then too
[1:23:44] aurelioristv: It would just be better to show his pov though, cuz the first totem kill was proposterously fast
[1:23:46] zachgamegodx: but h ere he is
[1:23:49] markaimfire_: Anyone who has played CSGO as a decent level knows Global players are on another level. Unparalleled response time
[1:23:50] simstarx: @absterge was the valorant/cs comment serious? KEKW
[1:23:53] nightmxz: reaction time on anticipation can be under 100milliseconds lol
[1:23:54] turkeybaster9: Gotta cross CC the wiz before you just throw out link
[1:23:56] reaperz14: The delay doesn't matter lol
[1:23:56] What_ln_Tarnation: you think blizz will investigate it?

[1:24:21] SweatyDaniels: Saimiyam also sniped totems he must be cheating

[1:26:01] Hobblefoot: I was in awe of how Pika did half the damage of pretty much every other Outlaw out there and still managed play in such a way as to allow Wizk to be a complete monster out there.

[1:34:38] QwQGolden: DH with an ego complex, surely not ???
[1:34:45] Roundhere_: i would reverse thro every game the DH is on my team so he can go sit in q for 30 mins
[1:34:50] hugs_3: rizdh buys rating with money. it's the hot topic on moonguard atm
[1:34:51] nightmxz: Maybe the dh should glimpse some polies instead of easily getting hit by every single 1
[1:34:52] Somanie: @QwQGolden I was thinking the same shit KEKW
[1:34:54] cyborg1141: Waits 45 mins for q yells at healer-healer leaves back in 45 min q..
[1:35:06] Boruox: flaming your healer is not a good idea
[1:35:14] NightMunchies: if he throws this game  find him WM kill him everytime u see em
[1:35:19] ItsBees: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpotlessEmpathicShingleMcaT-6xdlicW65ikAYqgD couldn't resist rukiGrin

[1:36:39] NightMunchies: yup
[1:36:40] fugginhiding: nothing is better than destroying the main character of the arena in a game
[1:36:40] Razdruid: when people accuse R1 players of cheating its interesting because its like accusing a pro baseball player of cheating. like their brains are used to baseballs flying at 100mph. they just react faster
[1:36:43] bobbybigbuxx: i have 2 and they are really fun

[1:38:04] cyborg1141: 1600 2400 games played gigachad
[1:38:12] NightMunchies: every team is trying to catch up to the Best
[1:38:16] wreklol: do you know who he is? multi duelist rizdh! he has multiple characters that are upwards of 1600 this season alone. you need to respect the name ven
[1:38:21] Thoreya: LUL
[1:38:22] Haipoo: yo.,..even though dh and arms and even rogue is that strong...do you overall consider this a melee or caster meta?
[1:38:36] QwQGolden: Guys guys he fed 70% of the games due to no CC relax
[1:38:50] Extramediums: It's a good player meta at high bracket, and a zug zug meta at lower bracket
[1:38:54] SlogreTheOgre: Melee meta + the usual suspects for wizards lol
[1:38:56] NightMunchies: sweet
[1:38:56] SweatyDaniels: pretty sure DH players actually just macro angry messages directed at healers into their rotation
[1:39:05] flandrs: 6-0 inc
[1:39:09] Grissu_: HUHH
[1:39:11] xdtai: also, probably just gonna try to learn how to heal because sitting in a 40 minute queue just to have a bad game is the worst feeling ever
[1:39:12] skez_live: lol wtf "how do i play this" wins 3 in a row
[1:39:13] stankylank: @SweatyDaniels lol so true
[1:39:19] SlogreTheOgre: monkaS about to get farmed by the rizzgod himself

[1:39:26] panjack13: @SweatyDaniels Raging at your teammates is part of the class fantasy
[1:39:31] Steveleeb: imagine playing demon hunter
[1:39:32] Datguyjay: DH is such a chill experience too idk how people get so mad playing it
[1:39:33] bearzy331: Venruki can u explain a clip of wiz glitching out cdew's totem during the AWC cup?

[1:39:50] ayyyrod: put the clip bear
[1:40:00] bearzy331: I get timed out
[1:40:01] Badasti: @Datguyjay i have no idea, if I get fed up with healing or playing my mage I literally zone out on DH. Literally nto a worry in the world
[1:40:06] Razdruid: I feel like with how many DH are in solo going sub and just hard focusing them would be fun
[1:40:08] Somanie: @bearzy331 you might have better luck asking abt that when he isn't occupied with healing a shuff
[1:40:09] Six_awc: Bearzy331 wizk explains it in the clip that you keep linking lol
[1:40:23] bearzy331: Yes he explains that its a cheat
[1:40:29] PromiscuousToilet: @Datguyjay because dh is made for people with 3 braincells. those types tend to be angry because they know very little about anything. emotion included
[1:40:30] qwuxone: I swear I have this same playlist from like 2010 @venruki
[1:40:30] AdamHeron12: great playlist, brings back some mems ziqoJAM
[1:40:32] NightMunchies: it was
[1:40:32] Extramediums: "Hey DH, could you use cd's to help me when I get hard focused? You end up taking tons of damage in those time spans and it would really help the team play, Thank you!"  DH: "I AM MY SCARSSSSSSS!"
[1:40:33] mvqq: yo ven gj casting yday @venruki
[1:40:41] bearzy331: hes also known for ddosing in rbgs during MoP
[1:40:43] SlogreTheOgre: is this the clip where he killed the totem before it procs? Hows that cheating lol
[1:40:51] Razdruid: LMAO
[1:40:54] What_ln_Tarnation: mage griefs you KEKW
[1:40:55] panjack13: @Extramediums 10/10
[1:40:56] Badasti: that was an awful wall
[1:40:56] Shakertime: holy
[1:40:57] Six_awc: he said, i am expecting a link so he casts VT for global, and then mouseover where he thinks the link is gonna be
[1:40:57] ItsRoxasXD: HAHAHA
[1:41:00] cyborg1141: He killed it before it spawned bruh
[1:41:02] SweatyDaniels: outplayed by your own team
[1:41:12] dailyshuffle: damn this would be a good fail of the month clip
[1:41:16] dailyshuffle: LUL
[1:41:16] Gnarbariann: Actual griefing with that wall LUL
[1:41:19] Six_awc: and then it was 70% cursor placement
[1:41:22] orcrimmar: guess they didn't know which priest you were talking about when you said "cc dh/priest" LUL
[1:41:24] Somanie: @bearzy331 this stupid shit again Stare
[1:41:33] Badasti: 2v4, this mage is in cahoots with the dh
[1:41:33] bearzy331: I mean
[1:41:34] stankylank: @cyborg1141 you think he has a "kill totem" cheat? lmao
[1:41:36] panjack13: Often CC my own healer
[1:41:45] bearzy331: how u going to deny cheaters in any game when devs legit que with them for content
[1:41:47] sbrees: mana comparison is rediculous
[1:41:50] cyborg1141: No Mayne a targeting macro and a 1 key
[1:41:57] Somanie: "ppl think he did this thing over a decade ago Madge " like
[1:41:58] cyborg1141: I dunno
[1:42:00] kiefxd: that dh is walking around confused af
[1:42:01] Voriq: i still listen to Blink-182 everyday lol love their music
[1:42:02] SweatyDaniels: everyone complaining about cyclone is coping. i think they should let druids cyclone their own team to bring it up to par with time stop
[1:42:02] Zeuvin: @venruki what healers do you enjoy playing this season?
[1:42:03] panjack13: Is is that insane to have a /target macro for a spirit link totem? Feels like something a pro level player would have
[1:42:05] sbrees: You are oom and disc has 100% mana
[1:42:06] NightMunchies: killing a totem is not cheating
[1:42:08] higanheim: DH was sitting there tying angrily during the game at his healer there
[1:42:09] panjack13: Bis song here
[1:42:11] Steveleeb: I was literally just wondering that ven lmao
[1:42:12] ALLtheEXP: huh, guess RizDH should have played better that round
[1:42:12] healmeshammy: ms?
[1:42:15] goodforyou: Absterge effect
[1:42:16] Six_awc: Bearzy332 if wizk is cheating in a AWC tourny why isnt he banned?
[1:42:18] NightMunchies: i do it all the time
[1:42:18] goodforyou: too aggro
[1:42:18] mvqq: how many ads pr hour do u think is too many ven? @venruki
[1:42:24] bollskis: @SweatyDaniels lol
[1:42:25] hugs_3: that dh is so bad
[1:42:26] Gushingcoom: 1 ad
[1:42:28] skez_live: he didnt spend any mana dispelling the DH either
[1:42:29] bearzy331: Wiz was known for ddosing in rbgs during mop, he found a way to kill link totem before it even comes out, which is a glitch
[1:42:31] kazz_ret: good vmusic ven
[1:42:32] Intravz: hpriest mana isnt too great
[1:42:36] PromiscuousToilet: @panjack13 you cant macro totem stomps.
[1:42:37] dipicat: @mvqq HEY MVQ
[1:42:42] Datguyjay: over a hundred is probably too many
[1:42:45] bollskis: @bearzy331 killed it after it came out
[1:42:49] brolic_9k: no one likes ads
[1:42:50] alvinkada317: mvq the goat
[1:42:50] bearzy331: watch the clip
[1:42:50] mvqq: i wanna max it out but i wonder if i'll lose alll my viewers KEKW
[1:42:53] AlphasaurusRexx: @bearzy331 somebody is big mad that their favorite team didnt win
[1:42:54] Somanie: @bearzy331 my love, mouseover macros exist
[1:42:59] PromiscuousToilet: @mvqq at least 300 an hr. if they aint subbed fuck em
[1:43:01] mvqq: id juust like to make more than 10$ an hour
[1:43:01] ItsRoxasXD: @bearzy331 he killed it after it came out... im not sure what you're getting at here man
[1:43:01] xdtai: 30 ads per hour, 1 min each ad
[1:43:01] Extramediums: @mvqq How ever many your viewers will tolerate before unfollowing or subscribing.
[1:43:02] Maaybees: tbh i dont mind 1:30 ad an hour
[1:43:04] brolic_9k: they dont even work
[1:43:09] dipicat: i cant believe theres only 1 more awc tourney this seas and its in 2 days
[1:43:09] bearzy331: Moveover macros dont kill totems before they come out
[1:43:10] wyldeshock: @mvqq what viewers
[1:43:10] Steveleeb: I am much more inclined to leave a stream when an ad runs. The content has to be primo for me to sit through that
[1:43:11] dougdimaddome: @mvqq you should just send for a month and see what happens
[1:43:14] ALLtheEXP: @Somanie what a sweet way to shut someone down
[1:43:16] dipicat: this 2 cup thing is interesting
[1:43:19] panjack13: @PromiscuousToilet  really? Genuinely not my area of knowledge
[1:43:30] mvqq: yea maybe i do 1 stream with maxed out ads and see what happens
[1:43:30] dougdimaddome: end of the day if ppl want no ads they should just sub lol
[1:43:32] PromiscuousToilet: @panjack13 yeah. you cant macro totem targeting
[1:43:37] Six_awc: @bearzy331 I watched the clip and listened to him explain his thought process, but i dont wanna start a feud in Vens chat
[1:43:44] ItsRoxasXD: they need check wizk him pc....
[1:43:47] bearzy331: so you're saying theres no reason to use link totem against players that can kill it before it comes out
[1:43:48] panjack13: @PromiscuousToilet Ok good to know ty
[1:43:48] Extramediums: @mvqq you can also run them mid game as a dh team because every one already knows the outcome of the round
[1:43:56] ALLtheEXP: @Extramediums kekW
[1:43:58] Somanie: we've talked about this so extensively today already, pls KEKW
[1:43:58] Hark0n: nice fear demon king LUL
[1:44:07] Proffzx: I normally leave if there’s more than 2 adds at a time, those 7 adds for a few minutes I’m out @mvqq
[1:44:08] QwQGolden: @bearzy331  ziqoAim
[1:44:14] SlogreTheOgre: @bearzy331 a major weakness of shaman has always been the vulnerability of their totems
[1:44:38] PromiscuousToilet: wizk totem macro is not normally. they should check hims pc
[1:44:52] bearzy331: ^
[1:44:53] AlphasaurusRexx: @bearzy331 youre high on copium bear
[1:44:53] pisceslonewolf: Shamans don't have cooldowns
[1:44:54] SaltyBites: Absterge playing with a cheater while complaining about a guy who just outplayed him is not surprising
[1:44:55] ItsRoxasXD: this is not normally.... they need check him pc...
[1:45:11] bearzy331: Bruh u guys are dumb or bots, u can't kill a link totem before it even comes out
[1:45:12] NightMunchies: totems r instant casts
[1:45:15] SlogreTheOgre: Some cringelords in chat today man
[1:45:18] ReApEr4O1: gotta love a competitve game were you are only as good as your addons. imagine what addons we dont know about that can only be bought with real money.
[1:45:21] bearzy331: killing it before it activates is different
[1:45:25] Somanie: @bearzy331 no u <3
[1:45:28] cyborg1141: I'd never make a target static totem macro >.> or scroll target it
[1:45:29] ALLtheEXP: @ItsRoxasXD well...check him pc!
[1:45:38] bollskis: @bearzy331 he killed it after it came out bruv
[1:45:39] bearzy331: Venruki can u explain a clip of wiz glitching out cdew's totem during the AWC cup?
[1:45:39] Extramediums: Macros for totems is something that is restricted within the macro system, so if a target totem macro is to be used, there has to be something in conjunction with it to allow the 'macro' to run outside the typical macro systems
[1:45:42] ItsRoxasXD: @bearzy331 no shot you're serious lol
[1:45:46] qwuxone: crushing this DH
[1:45:47] Badasti: Ven after swap I recommend sending a Power Word: Life on yourself - short CD fat heal
[1:45:48] skez_live: @bearzy331 exactly so why are you argueing? the totem was out, you just didnt see it from a third person pov of the streaming client
[1:45:48] ItsRoxasXD: @ALLtheEXP >:(
[1:45:51] Six_awc: Welp sorry Ven lotta arguing going on in here
[1:45:52] notjayrip: poor rizdh
[1:45:54] maybethistimepls: great job casting as always ven
[1:45:56] Sheepyogirl: 6/6 LETS GO
[1:46:00] bearzy331: the animation of the totem wasnt even out yet m8
[1:46:03] Somanie: ven pls answer this dude, he's posted that message 50 times this shuffle KEKW
[1:46:03] bearzy331: there was no nameplate for it
[1:46:04] macielmpr: @venruki what do you prefer? lock or priest?
[1:46:05] inigomonntoya: "I'm so bad"  currently 5/5
[1:46:12] alvinkada317: the dh is toxic af
[1:46:13] Intravz: i wonder what dh is saying to the other priest? lol
[1:46:15] ninetysix: did pika finally get the gold ?
[1:46:15] bobbybigbuxx: that DH is trash
[1:46:16] Gnarbariann: Hopefully the dh dies this round, send him out on a good note
[1:46:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @bearzy331 dog you agreed to promiscuous and he was 100% trolling you lol. spirit link does not activate as soon as it's put down it legit takes a second to link
[1:46:19] bobbybigbuxx: hes upset bc he cant get better
[1:46:22] PromiscuousToilet: @Extramediums thank you. you cannot target totems via macro. if it somehow did, then something was glitched
[1:46:22] panjack13: I think that DH is the kind of person who just yells in SS
[1:46:25] LHermite: 5 wins wtf?
[1:46:29] bearzy331: @alpha ur dumb
[1:46:29] bollskis: @bearzy331 if ur talking about on the stream that was 3rd person pov lol this take
[1:46:30] nerdyorc_: How does someone even have 48 rating
[1:46:30] bearzy331: dont talk to me
[1:46:32] What_ln_Tarnation: tell him to give you his prime sub
[1:46:33] Stoichulk: "I'm bad" wins 6 games....
[1:46:46] jacob_the_mage: 100% a ven song
[1:46:50] higanheim: my jam
[1:46:52] ItsRoxasXD: bearzy gotta be trolling
[1:46:57] bearzy331: Lets give a shaman a link totem and let someone kill it without it coming fully out while casting on someone else
[1:46:59] Somanie: @bearzy331 you're in a chat full of people that disagree with you, please take a second to consider the idea of you being the idiot here
[1:47:01] PromiscuousToilet: "im bad" *wins zero games Sadge
[1:47:03] SlogreTheOgre: @bearzy331 bro u can see link out in the clip. Youre trolling or what?
[1:47:12] ALLtheEXP: 5/5
[1:47:17] What_ln_Tarnation: priests have serenity too?
[1:47:19] inigomonntoya: "I'm so bad"  other priest "I hate that guy"
[1:47:30] pisceslonewolf: Whether there was cheating involved or not. Spirit Link not activating instantly is not ok. Can we agree on this!?
[1:47:33] AlphasaurusRexx: @bearzy331 im dumb because you dont have a basic understanding of how totems work?
[1:47:34] ReApEr4O1: he was using a weakaura that makes the nameplate the size of half his screen
[1:47:35] bearzy331: i see him casting on someone else while the totem was being places and insta killed without canceling a global
[1:47:38] PromiscuousToilet: imagine being able to 1 shot a 3 min CD
[1:47:51] Badasti: good to keep renew up on every one all the time too - gives you free serenities and free flash heals
[1:47:55] kiefxd: The mind control broke him
[1:47:59] kiefxd: you sent him into a fit
[1:48:07] SweatyDaniels: DH gets mad about polymorphs, cant even stun the MC on his healer
[1:48:07] Jihnn: The DH is furiously typing in Ven's chat
[1:48:08] pisceslonewolf: @PromiscuousToilet Exactly
[1:48:09] Gushingcoom: he did a lightning quick post on the forums
[1:48:10] bearzy331: its just weird its the same guy known for cheating in mop
[1:48:13] bearzy331: my only issue
[1:48:15] SlogreTheOgre: @bearzy331 Youre blind or lying. Wiz was strafing left as the link was placed, not casting anything
[1:48:18] bollskis: tbh sad this whole totem nonsense is this noisy lol
[1:48:20] bearzy331: go figure hes on pika's team too
[1:48:25] kiefxd: @Gushingcoom LUL
[1:48:30] Hoodwinkel: not a singöe counterspell
[1:48:33] tea_berri: @Badasti nice im leveling holy thanks for tip
[1:48:34] ALLtheEXP: @SlogreTheOgre He's got an agenda
[1:48:39] Somanie: @bearzy331 people keep bringing that shit up but there's not a single source for any part of that accusation LOL
[1:48:39] bollskis: sik play that was also a throw blowing up into check him pc
[1:48:41] Smexxin: you're talking about something that was over 12 years ago @bearzy331
[1:48:44] Haipoo: just a flat 20% dh nerf would shift the entire meta
[1:48:45] AlphasaurusRexx: @bearzy331 i think youre only issue is you dont like that your team lost
[1:48:48] Haipoo: its so dumb
[1:48:51] Six_awc: easy 6-0
[1:48:52] bearzy331: @SlogreTheOgre you're actually dumb af, he brags about killing it without canceling his cast
[1:48:54] ItsRoxasXD: mop was so long ago, how is that even relevant here
[1:48:55] What_ln_Tarnation: KEKW
[1:48:56] rocky760g: source “trust me bro”
[1:48:59] ALLtheEXP: RizDH rn cryin
[1:49:00] arzak: poor priest
[1:49:05] dakotan517: holy shit i just realized this is nsync
[1:49:05] bobbybigbuxx: 6-0 and says the whole time, "I'm so bad"
[1:49:11] Badasti: @tea_berri yw, the 4 set gives you a buff where serenity doesnt consume charges - procs from renew. Good to make a weakaura for it
[1:49:12] cyborg1141: His mom didn't have a nameplate still hit it
[1:49:16] bollskis: @bearzy331 he was channeling and his global was back
[1:49:16] PromiscuousToilet: imagine casting while casting and not cancelling your cast 5Head
[1:49:16] Gnarbariann: Can't dispel that L
[1:49:17] cyborg1141: Too far
[1:49:27] inigomonntoya: Bad from R1 standards I guess
[1:49:29] Somanie: @bearzy331 again, you're in a chat full of people that do not agree with you and that have been countering everything you say. You NEED to consider the possibility that YOU are the "dumb af" party here
[1:49:29] QwQGolden: literal modern day canceller lmao - 0 teams had issue with Wizk, no 1 cares about your crusty ass opinion
[1:49:31] jacob_the_mage: Ven you gotta make the enemies go bye bye bye
[1:49:31] ALLtheEXP: I too, am uncomfortable when I go 6-0
[1:49:35] sbrees: holy priest mana is a big problem
[1:49:35] NightMunchies: when did this so called cheating take place>
[1:49:37] AlphasaurusRexx: @venruki how are you hitting shift+6 and ctrl+t comfortably while moving
[1:49:45] SlogreTheOgre: @bearzy331 watch the clip he cuts void torrent short to do it...
[1:49:48] bobbybigbuxx: I am so tilted the 6th game bc I have had people just quit and I get nothing
[1:49:49] Haipoo: so bad on unholy but r1 nolifed the game for the last 20 years :D:D
[1:49:49] bearzy331: I dont really need answers from the plebs watching retail i want an answer from the r1 player with knowledge
[1:49:54] Haipoo: holy*
[1:49:58] alvinkada317: shift 6 isn’t even hard
[1:50:04] rizdane: grats facing a 1600 priest who doesnt dispel
[1:50:04] alvinkada317: unless you got baby hands
[1:50:05] PromiscuousToilet: @bearzy331 okay let me explain it then Kappa
[1:50:06] Zeniticon: shift + 0
[1:50:07] Somanie: @bearzy331 NOW would be a good time to post the question for Ven, when he's actually paying attention to chat LMFAO
[1:50:07] bearzy331: Venruki can u explain a clip of wiz glitching out cdew's totem during the AWC cup?
[1:50:09] waelrick: LUL
[1:50:10] ALLtheEXP: ouch, he hurt me right in the pleb
[1:50:12] SlogreTheOgre: Ven tell him how cooked he is please god
[1:50:14] ItsRoxasXD: wizk him pc...
[1:50:17] NightMunchies: hes going off
[1:50:21] bearzy331: before it spawned
[1:50:23] sdotpuff: Checking him pc
[1:50:23] bearzy331: while casting
[1:50:24] ALLtheEXP: @bearzy331 kekW
[1:50:25] Somanie: he posted that question ^^ 50 times during your shuffle and got fucking mad that you didn't answer him but chat did
[1:50:25] rocky760g: if you need answers then it’s obvious you don’t understand lmfao
[1:50:26] bobbybigbuxx: @bearzy331 lol he didn't glitch it out, he sniped it
[1:50:31] Somanie: started calling everyone dumb af
[1:50:31] arzak: he has autoclick
[1:50:32] dipicat: wiz explained it himself, he was mousing over where the totem would be and spam click pained it
[1:50:38] Jihnn: @bearzy331 Wizk explains it here: https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyPolishedBorkPermaSmug-OOlmUlksReO-lrLX
[1:50:38] panjack13: @bearzy331 How dare you I am a 300 rated resto shaman in RBg
[1:50:39] dipicat: or he had a mouseover pain macro for totems
[1:50:43] cyborg1141: Ngl mine end at 1-4 shift 4 baby hands hard life. Can't even hold a burger
[1:50:50] sparqTTV: is tich dead there's no1 at sparks ?
[1:50:53] sparqTTV: @venruki
[1:50:53] NightMunchies: its been explained clearly
[1:51:01] sparqTTV: at normal spot
[1:51:02] ALLtheEXP: @panjack13 omg, i didn't realize i was in the vicinity of royalty
[1:51:06] alvinkada317: i would imagine cdew wouldn’t place link in the most obvious place, ideally more to the side but still inside the circle
[1:51:11] pisceslonewolf: CAN WE AGREE SPIRIT LINK SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE KILLED BEFORE IT DID A SINGLE THING?
[1:51:16] nerdyorc_: ppl that say thats a hack havent seen nearly enough r1 games, link dying super quick happens all the time
[1:51:17] ALLtheEXP: no
[1:51:17] PromiscuousToilet: Why can you 1 shot a 3min cd with swp tho KEKW
[1:51:22] Somanie: again, didn't even take the time to consider HE might be tripping when multiple people have told him he's tripping
[1:51:24] panjack13: @ALLtheEXP Finally the recognition I deserve :)
[1:51:25] bobbybigbuxx: mouseover macro spamming is acceptable
[1:51:36] mneYEP: i would agree if he wasnt channeling torrent at the time.. a stop cast macro would kill the channel when he pressed it
[1:51:39] mneYEP: if he was spamming it
[1:51:44] Intravz: @promiscuoustoilet thats the biggest question tbh
[1:51:45] SweatyDaniels: Wizk math: kill spirit link instantly, die into observer trying to kill Samiyam.
[1:51:46] PromiscuousToilet: but you cant mouseover macro a totem focus, no?
[1:51:46] tonshi1: lmao, can't believe this topic is still going
[1:51:51] bobbybigbuxx: I think he just mousesover it and spams pain
[1:51:56] SlogreTheOgre: yea but but but something ddos mop it cant be real!!!!!
[1:51:59] SlogreTheOgre: Kappa
[1:52:04] ItsRoxasXD: i love how pika was like "IF HE SHADOW WORD PAINED THE GUY HE WOULDVE DIED" it was so funny
[1:52:05] Badasti: also when you cast the totem it doesnt suddenly appear, it fades in, so the nameplate appears long before the actual totem animation fully fades in
[1:52:07] Voriq: check him pc
[1:52:11] hercybrah: check him pc
[1:52:15] mneYEP: who knows.. probably just a latency thing that made it look bad maybe
[1:52:15] SweatyDaniels: shit i fucke dup my copypasta
[1:52:15] tonshi1: just enjoy greatness when you see it
[1:52:17] BlueDreamLegend: awc WAS BAGNING
[1:52:21] jag_pvp: from what i can see he didnt kill it before it ticked there was no one inside the ring with sam
[1:52:22] QwQGolden: Why tho ? they have no experience or standing to give their stone age opnions
[1:52:25] jporter_: loved seeing all the rsham
[1:52:26] qwuxone: my streamer lost, must be a cheater! Madge
[1:52:27] kornystreamz: I'm pretty sure it was just a macro wizk uses lol
[1:52:29] turkeybaster9: I heard WIZK is on creatine
[1:52:35] doyouevenwow1: que up so my solo will pop lol
[1:52:37] Sheepyou: somehow im rly having fun on my hpriest in shuffle since i watched jay yesterday LUL
[1:52:40] CaranoBlaze: Spirit Link being able to be killed like that only is further proof why I hate that spell in the first place and think R Sham big CDs are garbage.
[1:52:51] Intravz: ziqo and supa laughing about it on the replay had me busting up
[1:52:56] Texdizzle: i mean im willing to accept what he did was pure skill, BUUUUUUUTTTT id like to see his pov vod and if thats not possible simply recreate it in a controlled scenario and kill it at that same pace, we cant ignore this isnt sketch af
[1:53:00] CinematX: he also plays stacking nameplates so its easier to target the totem
[1:53:01] illiteratex: awc was the best its been in a while imo
[1:53:23] NightMunchies: was insane
[1:53:23] orcrimmar: that totem kill doesn't even matter. Liquid ended up winning the round and it only happened once. so idk why people are making such a big deal about it.
[1:53:24] toljar: Wizk speculations are hitting harder than the chess cheating scandal last year. nom-nom
[1:53:24] dougdimaddome: that wasn't even that fast feel like lol
[1:53:25] Datguyjay: monkaS
[1:53:25] SlogreTheOgre: SHEEESH
[1:53:26] mneYEP: LUL
[1:53:26] ALLtheEXP: Wiz is just a BOSS it's why he's an AWC Champ yo
[1:53:26] mvqq: thats a lil sus
[1:53:28] heysavant_: abrua is a huge open racist
[1:53:32] Somanie: look y'all, The Move had so much to prove bro. stakes were high, they lost GG sponsorship and rebranded, Pika instantly NUKES every totem he sees in every game I've ever seen him play. I'd be watching for totems like a hawk too
[1:53:36] AlphasaurusRexx: @venruki when you say dual keybind im assuming youre pressing shift on you kb and your 6 is a mouse button?
[1:53:36] SlogreTheOgre: mans gaming
[1:53:40] Merkflare: lol new kids
[1:53:45] Merkflare: think everything is cheating
[1:53:46] rockxtv: @orcrimmar that's an important part to the context, they didn't go on to win even
[1:53:47] dougdimaddome: there was a frame between the tranq dropping and the fear when you played it
[1:53:50] hutchyy917: watching awc always makes me want to jump back into retail. yous killed casting
[1:53:51] jporter_: was a fun awc, just wish it wasn t rogues all the time but oh well
[1:53:52] Badasti: how do you juke or kick people that juke? its no different
[1:53:52] PromiscuousToilet: I mean you cant claim sus on that nearly as much as the SLT
[1:53:54] hamsti: hamsti subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months, currently on a 3 month streak! :)
[1:53:54] bearzy331: can u watch the clip on stream lplz
[1:53:57] AlleviateWoW: i feel like sometimes you just get lucky with the timing, its not that complicated.
[1:53:57] fonandelino: nothing impressive tbh :d
[1:54:00] Gushingcoom: was that like .3 seconds
[1:54:01] 3mirrors: my team lost so its sus af
[1:54:01] mvqq: to perfectly fear tranq cancel on the exact frame is sus, only way ud do that is if u pre-press fear as u think its about to happen
[1:54:04] Mortammer: people think if they can't do it, must be cheating.....
[1:54:05] soddi: maybe he just feared the last moment he could have trinketed anyway, because if he trinket later, his mate gonna die = no reaction needed
[1:54:09] bobbybigbuxx: blizzard has all the logs, even logs of his pc, the install, all actions taken, etc etc  i am sure they will investigate, but I highly doubt he is cheating. He is an absolute beast.
[1:54:18] dougdimaddome: it wasn't even same frame?
[1:54:20] What_ln_Tarnation: its a sussy baka
[1:54:27] rocky760g: eyeball diff
[1:54:31] markaimfire_: and the fact they are literally waiting for it
[1:54:31] illiteratex: u think this was the best awc in a while ven?
[1:54:33] PromiscuousToilet: wizk doenst turn camera on. he must be alien. check him pc
[1:54:34] NightMunchies: when u play craft for 15+ years should know how things work
[1:54:35] SweatyDaniels: if he has him set on focus he can see every move he makes right?
[1:54:41] mvqq: ye but even with 100ms reaction time u wouldnt see what happened in this clip tho?
[1:54:43] myodoctor: if it was anyone other than wiz id be calling cheater
[1:54:44] bobbybigbuxx: I think they are all just extremely jealous of Wizk
[1:54:46] Badasti: Pika has his kick on release for faster kicks, he keeps the button pressed until he wants to use it
[1:54:47] ayyyrod: this is why mvqq is not in the top 8
[1:54:48] cyborg1141: Low hp druid hands hovering over fear
[1:54:48] ALLtheEXP: Omg someone must check him pc
[1:54:51] sdotpuff: Just check him pc already
[1:54:57] ItsRoxasXD: @ayyyrod LMAO
[1:54:59] Vramii: it’s not sus it’s just people who don’t have the skill trying to make excuses instead of just accepting they are not that good of a player
[1:54:59] Zeniticon: i mean Mes WA is pretty much the same thing, the sound that plays when ray of frost or simular effects goes off
[1:55:00] hamsti: yall are paranoid af
[1:55:03] Omgdoom: why is this even a topic? cdew was asked about it and said theres no way wizk is cheating
[1:55:05] mvqq: Like, by that logic it should b ez to stun someones trinket, u just react to it 4Head
[1:55:05] markaimfire_: @Badasti that
[1:55:07] jporter_: were all the rshams playing full mastery?
[1:55:08] fonandelino: that would be more surprise if he would not fear it, after all these years of training :D
[1:55:10] SweatyDaniels: Wizk skilled player but that is not normally, This very very insane....They need to check him pc and game.....Maybe he not cheating but maybe he using the game deficit ...and this cant seem on game screen..He needs to check-up...
[1:55:10] markaimfire_: is sick lol
[1:55:11] bollskis: low probability things will happen lol thse kids play 500k arenas
[1:55:12] rizdane: @SweatyDaniels stun was on cd but i did fear him?
[1:55:18] Voriq: Fearing off Tranq = Cheating EZ
[1:55:18] alvinkada317: we just watched you kill link and you were 100% anticipating it and it wasnt remotely close to wizk
[1:55:19] Xeliumimar: Clearly, it's a ping difference
[1:55:19] Nikademous: Pro = cheater confirmed
[1:55:25] cyborg1141: It's the 0.1 second kicks that sus me sus me hard
[1:55:29] rocky760g: lmfao
[1:55:30] mvqq: no mannnn ppl stun ppls trinkets by pre-pressing stun right as u think theyre gonna trinket
[1:55:31] bobbybigbuxx: thats why people gouge into kidney
[1:55:31] Zeniticon: its harder to sheep their trinket
[1:55:37] whspe: I think the only way you fear that tranq is to pre fear and guess the timing, no way you can react
[1:55:37] PromiscuousToilet: imagine being a random twitch chatter and calling out mvqq for not being top 8. Most pepega comment ive ever seen KEKW
[1:55:38] panjack13: His explanation seems extremely reasonable
[1:55:38] bobbybigbuxx: lol such trolls here
[1:55:47] Badasti: @cyborg1141 plenty of people have 0.1s reaction times dude XD
[1:55:49] NightMunchies: really idc my name wasn't called dont effect me  sure does others
[1:55:51] rizdane: lol venruki whats up with tjose lightning fast dispels on the warrior  LOL
[1:55:51] mneYEP: i think the death was a little more sus because of the way it went off.. the fear is whatever
[1:55:56] Xeliumimar: Hence the name
[1:55:58] sourbutts: if youre waiting for something to happen, you can react very quickly, issue is theres so many things to concentrate on in arena, it makes it hard to react to everything quickly
[1:55:58] ItsRoxasXD: its why his name is stungod
[1:56:00] Vramii: trinket stuns happen every game above 2100…. people saying that just admitting they play at a very very low level
[1:56:05] AlphasaurusRexx: @venruki please explain your dual keybind response =)
[1:56:06] alvinkada317: he lives up to the name lol
[1:56:07] Jihnn: Can't believe Ven is accusing Stungod of cheating smh my head
[1:56:12] SlogreTheOgre: stungod is one hell of a name
[1:56:12] Voriq: keep in mind the average pvp'er watching that AWC are 16-1800 players, if they see a good player do something they call it cheating lol it's like this in every game
[1:56:15] bearzy331: Most high rated players cheat, venruki wasnt going to release the macro for kick until it became popular.
[1:56:16] AdamHeron12: whats your thoughts on glacial spike vs comet storm on frost mage? seeing a lot more comet recently :)
[1:56:18] 인터넷포트: Hey Ven if u are interested in a 1800 CR Priest giving u some tips on how to play your class let me know I can teach u a thing or two about solo shuffle
[1:56:20] rizdane: game sucks and theres nothing to do what can i say
[1:56:24] Saitistreamy: hpriest new meta?
[1:56:25] Merkflare: flro
[1:56:25] DadRage: sainSip Spicy in here today.
[1:56:31] hamsti: this twitch chat is absolutely deep fried today
[1:56:31] Merkflare: yikes
[1:56:32] hamsti: holy shit
[1:56:34] NightMunchies: lol
[1:56:36] Badasti: the avg reaction time is 0.273 seconds - and thats not even people competing at a professional level, the top 0.1% of players
[1:56:36] Shakertime: bad mental
[1:56:37] kreyzy8: @rizdane then quit
[1:56:37] Jihnn: @rizdane Rizdh rukiChamp
[1:56:39] kazz_ret: @rizdane get a life
[1:56:41] SweatyDaniels: DH's have highest APM if you count typing in chat
[1:56:42] PromiscuousToilet: This reminds me of when i play CoD. I am really bad at FPS so i nonstop die and every time i die the person that kills me apperas to be cheating from my PoV KEKW
[1:56:44] Vaneshaa16: LUL
[1:56:45] malvarcla: oh its the dh looool
[1:56:46] Vramii: then go so,where else loser haha
[1:56:46] beeftip: What's up with you being better at the mechanics than me?!
[1:56:48] mvqq: yeah but like im telling u the way u can stun someones trinket is by pressing stun when u think theyre gonna trinket, that's the only way - if you think about it it makes sense, you have to stun someone inbetween the 30 ms input delay there is between someone trinketting and vanishing
[1:56:49] bobbybigbuxx: @rizdane I challenge you to a duel sir. I fart in your general direction.
[1:56:51] ReApEr4O1: this is all stupid man. they should just make a separate client for people to download to play in tournaments. no addon no nothing, then we can just completely avoid conversations like these...
[1:56:53] mneYEP: @Voriq bicmex thought it looked weird too.. hes not 1800.. lol
[1:56:54] sourbutts: id love to watch everyone who calling him a cheat, play VS wizk on a LAN
[1:56:55] rizdane: i just want dispelled so i can play the game. dont know who wouldnt get frustrated
[1:56:55] gtwwtg: Its almost like these pro players can predict what cc and abilities are coming next..
[1:57:00] nimonic_llt: bs lol
[1:57:02] itschen: most of these people are 1600 player while hating people who are better than them
[1:57:05] QwQGolden: we are entering into the 'Must be cheating' Meta holy FUCK
[1:57:06] Voriq: @mneYEP i didn't ask
[1:57:10] carrvve: ven i think it is time to see waht your reaction time is
[1:57:10] Texdizzle: 67.2% of statistics are made up on the spot
[1:57:14] pisceslonewolf: @venruki Can we agree that it should not be possible to destroy a 3 min CD before it ticks even once? Plzzz
[1:57:20] mvqq: no u can't after 50% duration is over
[1:57:24] mvqq: u can overlap after 50% duration
[1:57:26] mneYEP: @Voriq did you pay money for you name to look that way man? thats super cool.
[1:57:26] Zeniticon: you can
[1:57:32] azliaris1: yes you can overlap lol
[1:57:32] whspe: you can 100% overlap
[1:57:37] Voriq: @mneYEP thanks
[1:57:37] orcrimmar: @rizdane play a healer and you'll see why you sometimes can't afford the global for a sheep dispell
[1:57:42] PromiscuousToilet: How did he target and kill the totem so fast tho if you cannot target macro totems
[1:57:47] Slayer_Eagleone: venruki last nights awc finals were frickin lit dude
[1:57:52] Slayer_Eagleone: had a lot of fun
[1:57:56] Merkflare: he explained it already
[1:57:56] SaltyBites: He feared him before the tranquility even finished, did he just guess?
[1:57:57] cyborg1141: Can spam press if heal is casting kick
[1:58:03] mneYEP: @Voriq yea keep it up man!
[1:58:05] slickdaddyg69: Good to see jayti have inspired u
[1:58:07] Xeliumimar: is this totem thing just going to be the conversation for the next few days LUL
[1:58:10] malvarcla: @venruki surprising that echo got knocked out?
[1:58:11] mvqq: idk if u can cheap over a cheap insta, but regardless, ppl aren't stunning trinkets on reaction, and because this is true there's no way wizk feared someones tranq like this on the exact frame
[1:58:15] pisceslonewolf: @venruki Can we agree that it should not be possible to destroy a 3 min CD before it ticks even once? Plzzz
[1:58:22] mvqq: only way is to predict the cancel
[1:58:23] ItsRoxasXD: i wonder what wouldve happened if pikaboo went assassination or sub in the first games vs liquid
[1:58:24] mvqq: which is possible ofc
[1:58:31] Texdizzle: these cheaters gas light tho, do sketch shit get called out and just claim its a skill above a plebs comprehension, some of yall act like LANCE FUCKING ARMSTRONG wasnt a thing
[1:58:32] ayyyrod: mvq needs to be figuring out the number of ads to run instead of this nonsense
[1:58:35] whspe: ya mvqq is right here
[1:58:35] PromiscuousToilet: wizk just guessed tranq cancel and got it right
[1:58:37] SweatyDaniels: if he pre casts his fear he can cancel it if tranq is still up
[1:58:38] NightMunchies: its poss
[1:58:39] mvqq: true @ayyyrod
[1:58:42] doyouevenwow1: my guess he just pressed it as he thought he was gonna cancel tranq
[1:58:42] SaltyBites: no it didnt finish
[1:58:44] itschen: Mvq is right here
[1:58:47] SweatyDaniels: so if he times it right
[1:58:49] Vramii: people don’t realize how good these players are. they know what everyone is going to do before they do it most of the time. there is tons of predictive game play going on. it’s not cheating it’s knowing the game.
[1:58:49] sdotpuff: Yeah if he says he predicted the cancel it would be easily explained
[1:58:53] malvarcla: @mvqq I believe you
[1:58:55] SweatyDaniels: he doesnt need to cancel his cast and perfect rng timing W
[1:58:56] Slayer_Eagleone: is that the real mvqq?
[1:59:06] mvqq: I'M REAL
[1:59:07] hamsti: What happened that everyone thinks everyone cheats now? Rofl
[1:59:08] mvqq: mvqqJames
[1:59:12] hamsti: Such a bizarre twitch chat meta
[1:59:14] ayyyrod: btw that number is max mvq; we always just let the roll and run
[1:59:15] Phreshbrew: why is everyone so mad lmao
[1:59:16] Slayer_Eagleone: :O
[1:59:21] bollskis: lol
[1:59:23] ayyyrod: then watch when done
[1:59:24] bearzy331: everyone cheats
[1:59:25] mvqq: @ayyyrod ok gonna test it tonight
[1:59:25] bearzy331: 100%
[1:59:28] Texdizzle: inhuman reaction kill on slt in a awc tourney game
[1:59:28] Gushingcoom: well, wait til the superbowl
[1:59:29] NightMunchies: idk what is cheating?
[1:59:31] Saitistreamy: because in every online pvp game a shit ton of people cheat
[1:59:32] Merkflare: they're just parroting stuff they've heard
[1:59:35] ayyyrod: i'll be there daddy
[1:59:36] SweatyDaniels: the game is balanced enough that people have to come up with something else to complain about
[1:59:36] Merkflare: mob mentality
[1:59:38] Saitistreamy: and wow is no different
[1:59:39] bearzy331: venruki wasnt going to release that one kick macro until it became popular
[1:59:40] Texdizzle: thats the problem its literally INHUMAN
[1:59:52] sourbutts: @mvqq he instant mouseover SWP a link totem, but theres stream delay on the actual totem popping on the floor so it looked way worse than it was
[1:59:54] 인터넷포트: I run into win traders in solo shuffle sometimes and man does it piss me off they dont even hide it
[1:59:56] cyborg1141: Pika's a legend inhuman
[2:00:06] Vramii: people should play rbgs to see how much people are actually cheating lol
[2:00:10] Badasti: if he was running a bot to snipe spirit link before it even ticks then why did it literally only happen once
[2:00:11] bearzy331: pika sits in 1600 bracket until he plays tounry
[2:00:11] Zeniticon: ppl are deathing blinds and have been for years, some things are predictable
[2:00:12] ItsRoxasXD: hes fucking popping off LOL
[2:00:12] NightMunchies: pika is beast
[2:00:14] slickdaddyg69: @cyborg1141 Pika got carried so hard yesterday
[2:00:15] pisceslonewolf: @Vramii True
[2:00:17] PromiscuousToilet: @mvqq im still confused how he targeted and killed a totem so fast if totem targeting is not possible? He just had a "do dmg at mouseover" and spammed a spot?
[2:00:21] bobbybigbuxx: @Vramii so true it hurts
[2:00:24] NightMunchies: no he didnt
[2:00:25] SweatyDaniels: @Vramii nobody on earth cares what RBG players do tho
[2:00:25] ryanblue98: what mmr is this
[2:00:26] Steveleeb: @bearzy331 Are you saying pika cheats?
[2:00:27] ItsRoxasXD: @slickdaddyg69 pika was sitting clones 90% of the games
[2:00:30] bearzy331: @PromiscuousToilet they'll never admit to cheat
[2:00:32] malvarcla: @인터넷포트 there arent win traders in shuffle, stop it
[2:00:37] bearzy331: @Steveleeb did i say that? no idiot read.
[2:00:39] Voriq: Where are yeew
[2:00:40] Texdizzle: he killed it so fast it didnt even tick in the game but yea its just "delay"
[2:00:41] 인터넷포트: @malvarcla believe it there are
[2:00:46] cyborg1141: BibleThump
[2:00:49] inigomonntoya: I mis rizdh
[2:00:50] pisceslonewolf: @malvarcla Clueless
[2:00:50] slickdaddyg69: @ItsRoxasXD Pika was also donating precogs like crazy
[2:00:54] Texdizzle: yall he on some bullshit you seen it live now get gas lighted if you want to but you seen it
[2:00:59] Steveleeb: @bearzy331 Are you upset you're 1600?
[2:00:59] PromiscuousToilet: @bearzy331 im not even say he cheated. The explanations explain everything BUT that to me.
[2:01:01] SlogreTheOgre: @PromiscuousToilet yes he was channeling void torrent so only load on his braid was looking for the link he knew was coming and pressing mouseover. Its a mix of skill+luck lol
[2:01:04] slickdaddyg69: @ItsRoxasXD He litterly missed 90% kicks
[2:01:08] mvqq: In my honest opinion there's only 2 ways he killed totem this way; Either, he has @cursor SW:P macro bound to his scroll wheel and he spammed it on the ground, OR, he uses a program that spam clicked the macro every .01 second
[2:01:08] sdotpuff: Is there a way to only show nameplates for totems? And not enemy players? If so then the totem thing can be explained.
[2:01:09] malvarcla: @pisceslonewolf maybe at 1400 mmr but not 2400+ lol
[2:01:11] ItsRoxasXD: yappin
[2:01:14] bobbybigbuxx: whenever i get a tank in SS i report them for throwing the game
[2:01:17] bollskis: imagine if he just killed sam instead of totem lol
[2:01:17] NightMunchies: good song ven
[2:01:17] pvalue01: prot war topping dam?
[2:01:19] ReApEr4O1: but the void torrent cast never ended and he killed the totem
[2:01:23] bearzy331: @PromiscuousToilet U can kill a totem before i spawns
[2:01:26] bollskis: avoid drama by winning
[2:01:33] flandrs: mvqq on a witch hunt
[2:01:33] NightMunchies: have halloween on christmas
[2:01:33] slickdaddyg69: @bobbybigbuxx I report always those who dies
[2:01:37] Steveleeb: Ven's stream has become the haven for salty 1600 players
[2:01:38] SweatyDaniels: @mvqq sounds like you have some expertise with these programs
[2:01:41] cyborg1141: Prot war shuffle gigachad
[2:01:41] Moobot: Latest video "The Casual PvP Community Is Begging For Help" view it here: youtu.be/ztKSy4IjNfo
[2:01:42] bearzy331: @PromiscuousToilet you dont have a whole team disconnect almost every other game in rbgs in MoP
[2:01:44] Badasti: @PromiscuousToilet Ven already explained this like 10 min ago you can find it in the vod. the totem also fades in, the nameplate for it will appear instantly. So to you it looks even more unrealistically fast than it already is
[2:01:47] pisceslonewolf: @malvarcla It literally gets easier the higher rating you get to. Since you can calulcate queues based on streamers and fewer people queueing.
[2:01:50] hamsti: If someone beats me in an arena i report them because they definitely cheat
[2:01:55] kreyzy8: lmao mvq starting drama because he plays with a known cheater and has to divert attention to someone else
[2:01:57] AlphasaurusRexx: @slickdaddyg69 i mean sometimes you get outplayed on kicks. doesnt mean he was carried. the control and pressure he creates gives his healer a lot of breathing room
[2:01:59] Vaneshaa16: LOVE THIS SONG <3
[2:01:59] mvqq: @Badasti still killed it be4 it ticked, so still has to be fast
[2:02:01] prometheusx47: unhealable healing
[2:02:02] SaltyBites: @mvqq how could he spam it with Samiyam infront of him? Unless he knew where it would be exactly
[2:02:04] SlogreTheOgre: @reaper4o1 I dont get this, when i watch the clip he clips the last like 15% of VT to SWP it?
[2:02:08] bollskis: @hamsti always
[2:02:08] jporter_: wizk inspiring me to play spriest again
[2:02:08] 인터넷포트: If u think ur hot stuff que up solo shuffle right now at 1800 rating im queing my name is "yodaddysun" and we can battle it out for 6 rounds
[2:02:09] bobbybigbuxx: @slickdaddyg69 good thing i always go 6-0
[2:02:13] mvqq: @SaltyBites just guessing game
[2:02:16] PunishedLrnz: Yeah people have been deathing blinds for 15yrs bc you know when to expect it. Now take this info and apply it to predicting spirit link and its "easy" to kill
[2:02:20] carrvve: prot is doing more dam than the outlaw lol
[2:02:24] slickdaddyg69: @AlphasaurusRexx I bet u never been above 1800 rating u clueless mate
[2:02:27] PromiscuousToilet: @SlogreTheOgre you think he saw the link and pressed the button faster than we, the viewer can even see it in slow mo. Come on
[2:02:32] sourbutts: jaime's been kickbotting for years idk what the problem is
[2:02:32] NightMunchies: u get beat in anything  gotta practice more Not report people
[2:02:34] SlogreTheOgre: @PromiscuousToilet No.
[2:02:39] Slayer_Eagleone: wait who was cheating in the AWC??
[2:02:43] malvarcla: oh yeah? then why wasnt wiz streaming? because he was cheating Kappa
[2:02:43] Slayer_Eagleone: Pika?
[2:02:43] foxyllama: Ur chat is aids today
[2:02:45] SweatyDaniels: Wizk skilled player but that is not normally, This very very insane....They need to check him pc and game.....Maybe he not cheating but maybe he using the game deficit ...and this cant seem on game screen..He needs to check-up...
[2:02:45] foxyllama: Holy
[2:02:54] AlphasaurusRexx: @slickdaddyg69 lmfao thinking retail pvp ladder is the same playstyle as AWC. delusional
[2:02:54] Xeliumimar: are you not playing 4 set for holy priest?
[2:02:58] bobbybigbuxx: @mvqq he anticipated where it was going to be generally (the nameplate addon makes the totem huge BTW) and was just spamming the mouseover pain during his channel
[2:02:58] ReApEr4O1: nice play
[2:02:59] yippey_: yuuuuuuuge
[2:02:59] Texdizzle: the bot peaked around the curtain yesterday we all seen it
[2:03:00] 인터넷포트: foxy getn troll baited hard
[2:03:04] PromiscuousToilet: @SlogreTheOgre so you think he simply got lucky on the spot and the timing? Possible. Not probably, but possible
[2:03:06] allenlondon210: tears
[2:03:06] StromicusRex: wth did i come into
[2:03:08] PromiscuousToilet: this chat is aids
[2:03:09] Slayer_Eagleone: LUL
[2:03:10] SlogreTheOgre: @PromiscuousToilet I think he was channeling void torrent so had time to guess where the link was going and spam his mouseover macro. He got lucky/kinda guessed the location so it killed the moment it spammed
[2:03:16] Gushingcoom: ur chat is HIV positive
[2:03:16] sdotpuff: Yeah saying chat is aids is pretty aids
[2:03:17] cyborg1141: The refs gave him a deflated 🐁
[2:03:25] bobbybigbuxx: its Wizk man, he is legit hero master of SP
[2:03:25] Slayer_Eagleone: :)
[2:03:26] SlogreTheOgre: @PromiscuousToilet if you verse the same shaman 5000 times you can guess where his totem would be, no?
[2:03:27] wackpoetic: cure me venruki rukiBlankie
[2:03:29] ReApEr4O1: HE DIDNT CHEAT ITS CALLED WEAKAURAS AND GIANT NAMEPLAY
[2:03:29] Vramii: ven keeps it real. don’t worry about the chat.
[2:03:30] sourbutts: wizkgate
[2:03:33] bearzy331: @PromiscuousToilet ty for explaining in a way i couldn't. Its impossible. Like i said, Venruki was probably using the kick macro that was consisered cheating before he made video on it. It was being released by a bunch before he made the video
[2:03:36] bobbybigbuxx: haters gunna hate!
[2:03:40] Merkflare: 1600 players are paranoid, what can you do
[2:03:44] slickdaddyg69: @AlphasaurusRexx wizk did all the preasure pika didnt even do 10 million dmg meanwhile wizk did 40 million wizk and absterge did it all u just a low player  and u have no clue what is going on in the games
[2:03:44] NightMunchies: i say leave it be move on
[2:03:45] Shakertime: @bearzy331 lol
[2:03:46] Texdizzle: its not the anticipating its killing it at a speed in which the game didnt register it
[2:03:46] Vramii: okay but the term wizgate is funny haha.
[2:03:51] SweatyDaniels: everyone follow @wizkx
[2:03:54] pisceslonewolf: Can we PLEASE agree you shouldn't be able to stop Spirit Link before it even does anything. Kill it fast sure, but the effect should be instant
[2:03:54] ALLtheEXP: Wizk is my dad you guys, and I really don't appreciate you dragging his name through the mud. He's a great dad and my literal hero
[2:03:55] hamsti: How does holy feel?
[2:03:56] kingcamps_alot: no one mention trill blade flurry to get kill on druid during traq though
[2:04:02] snacks_23: some ppl cant except that he is one of the best players in the world and have been playing for years
[2:04:05] ReApEr4O1: WAIT FOR WIZ TO STREAM AND BLOW UP HIS CHAT
[2:04:06] absterge: its the equivalent of someone killing my tremor when I tremor a sleep/fear on sham and they kill it before it ticks
[2:04:07] allenlondon210: lmao
[2:04:07] SammyLettuce: wizk simply the goat... ive been tryna tell yall
[2:04:07] mneYEP: i think the damage difference between series factored into that sketchyness lol
[2:04:11] Badasti: @PromiscuousToilet again the totem fades in, the nameplate is instant. Log on a shaman and see for yourself
[2:04:14] slickdaddyg69: @kingcamps_alot cuz its std as fk mate
[2:04:18] ReApEr4O1: LEAVE VENRUKI OUT OF IT U NERDS
[2:04:21] wreklol: could you imagine how big wizk's ego is from everyone calling him a cheater? i would feel like a god
[2:04:21] malvarcla: @absterge smoke god.
[2:04:26] Texdizzle: RELEASE THE VOD OR STREAM KILLING A SLT THAT FAST AGAIN
[2:04:31] slickdaddyg69: @absterge gj carrying pikaboo
[2:04:32] myodoctor: i pre wipe my butt sometimes
[2:04:35] bearzy331: @wreklol not the first time
[2:04:36] SlogreTheOgre: Its really not that hard to grasp how he did it... I dont get this controversy
[2:04:38] PromiscuousToilet: @Badasti but no shot he saw it himself and reacted faster than we a viewer can see it in slow mo. not possible
[2:04:40] wackpoetic: Spirit Link Totem is a notoriously reliable ability that always works 100% of the time, that is why people are so suspicious in this context
[2:04:41] ALLtheEXP: @myodoctor this is bis
[2:04:43] PunishedLrnz: @bearzy331 ahahha now your calling venruki a cheater too???
[2:04:44] Texdizzle: id love him to reproduce it if its such a thing he can do
[2:04:46] The__Swordmaster: Is there a way to make a macro that insta-targets a spirit link then destroys it or no?
[2:04:49] AlphasaurusRexx: @slickdaddyg69 youre actually dumb if you think damage is the only thing that matters in AWC. Theres a reason they play pikaboo and not jellybeans. more than just damage kiddo
[2:04:54] foxyllama: Totem tick on server time im pretty per the second, so u can have a spirit link thats instant or one that takes .99 of a second to load causing a delay
[2:05:03] StromicusRex: @SlogreTheOgre just haters prob
[2:05:06] bearzy331: @PunishedLrnz not a casual cheater no, but tricks of being rank 1 that negate the rules of the game
[2:05:08] foxyllama: Im using speech to txt
[2:05:09] SweatyDaniels: venruki’s smile brightens my day. if I have sad day, i just watch venruki. when venruki have good day, so do I. I love venruki and I hope he keep smile so we can all have good day
[2:05:10] foxyllama: Fk
[2:05:12] ALLtheEXP: Bearzy is witerwawy a troll

[2:05:14] absterge: @malvarcla
[2:05:21] 인터넷포트: But can u explain how Wiz K defeated a spirit link totem instantly with usage of macros in pvp combat?

[2:22:58] lolmangodx: i heard supa was very surprised by that
[2:23:01] reaperz14: Wouldn't competitors get kicked for doing that? Accusing other players though? lol
[2:23:03] hamsti: Is churches the one where people say the funny thing before they take your order in drivethrough? @StromicusRex
[2:23:03] wreklol: i have seen only high rated players (over 1200 in RBG) complaining so i trust them and will follow them blindly
[2:23:03] jacob_the_mage: 1200 CR demon hunters are the ones accusing wizk
[2:23:08] ryanwars17: I honestly think that link snipe wiz did in game 3 was accidental and damn lucky
[2:23:08] Aroty: Imagine being wizk right now feeling boss for nailing those totems and ppl cry cheater

[2:23:31] PromiscuousToilet: you shouldnt be able to SWP a 3 min cd.
[2:23:33] kiefxd: Wiz has played with legit every player at the top, and these forum randoms think they have a better say over actual competitors.

[2:23:42] knappster15: Link is outdated and needs to be changed
[2:23:45] kiefxd: It's actually fried
[2:23:46] Hobblefoot: I think if you are going to make ransom accusations about cheating with no evidence, you should be required to say it to their faces.  Seems reasonable.
[2:23:48] cyborg1141: Ngl I've only ever seen one 1240 rated shuffle player with 100 games and it was a feral druid

[2:39:11] StromicusRex: LA is the chargers
[2:39:11] codyallyn: They had to rewind the slomo how many times? to see it?  I dont see how wiz killed it when no one could see it.
[2:39:15] PromiscuousToilet: Austin prob gonna get the next NFL team

[2:39:23] StromicusRex: Austin can take the Texans
[2:39:32] hamsti: Austin can take the cowboys
[2:39:39] knappster15: @lordelenath it hasnt been possible for like 10-15 years or something. I forgot when they removed it
[2:39:39] StromicusRex: you know what i'd take that too
[2:39:40] PromiscuousToilet: just send all the texas teams to austin

[2:40:21] Omniax: Think its Aeaeaeae who plays dh
[2:40:23] Xeliumimar: I got the love rocket on the first try LMAO
[2:40:23] lordelenath: Since we're all talking AWC, did pika already comment on why he's being beaten in dmg by every rogue in the tournament? :D
[2:40:33] cyborg1141: 🪦
[2:40:36] NightMunchies: or anyone
[2:40:40] jubitor1: @venruki did u guys find out what happened to CDEW's spirit link in AWC vs The move?
[2:40:41] stankylank: @lordelenath you need to go touch some grass
[2:40:45] llseattlell: i feel like pika is a more utility player lol that dude is on it with cc chains kicks etc.
[2:40:47] nutz_hang_uneven: @lordelenath lmao tf
[2:40:47] ZhangTuShi: @NightMunchies haHAA
[2:40:49] PromiscuousToilet: Absterge said something about why pika's dmg is lower. i forgot what he said tho KEKW
[2:40:51] NightMunchies: could be his main
[2:41:04] nutz_hang_uneven: hes washed
[2:41:06] higanheim: is no one going to comment on how much cc pika had to sit vs the other rogue
[2:41:09] llseattlell: dont get me wrong he can absolutely blast people with damage but in terms of cc and utility hes him.
[2:41:10] hamsti: FailFish
[2:41:12] mat4th: I mean pika did win AWC with the lower dmg
[2:41:15] lordelenath: @stankylank stay cool man. I love pika, but it was sort of funny how every rogue outdamaged him by like 50% or some such.
[2:41:15] PromiscuousToilet: @nutz_hang_uneven same Sadge
[2:41:21] Badasti: Haha, Ven thinks you need to say something insulting for people to get their nuts in a twist in 2024 LUL
[2:41:21] mat4th: so he has to be doing something better than the other rogues
[2:41:26] nutz_hang_uneven: pika cross faded and still kicked ass
[2:41:32] nutz_hang_uneven: crazy
[2:41:35] goesidd: @lordelenath he played vs double disarm clone city
[2:41:42] stankylank: @lordelenath yes, but if damage was king in AWC then the results would look different, no?
[2:41:52] lordelenath: @goesidd he was also hard outdamaged vs. lock/rogue
[2:42:01] llseattlell: venruki would be better suited to commentate on pika for AWC he knows him well and also would know why he was lower etc.
[2:42:07] PromiscuousToilet: @stankylank according to my SS lobbies its all about dmg and i refuse to think otherwise Madge
[2:42:10] jacob_the_mage: not always about dmg...
[2:42:18] lordelenath: @stankylank sure. didn#t say he didnt earn the win. I juust found it super curious.
[2:42:19] goesidd: @lordelenath ye destro warlocks famously allow for alot of uptime
[2:42:23] nutz_hang_uneven: @lordelenath um actually type vibes
[2:42:27] mat4th: @PromiscuousToilet LMAO this guy is trOOOOOOling
[2:42:32] chubmax: i just played with that hpal
[2:42:57] NightMunchies: its all about  out lasting the other players
[2:43:37] lordelenath: guys, why all the hate? pika is awesome, the move earned their win. just honestly curious, I found it interesting to see.
[2:43:43] NightMunchies: if they cant kill u you're doing something right
[2:43:48] nutz_hang_uneven: pika playing and winning drunk has people's nuts in a twist
[2:44:14] mat4th: guy is trolling pika
[2:44:14] lordelenath: why pika was outdamaged by every rogue in awc
[2:44:14] PromiscuousToilet: people just love to worship other people because their lives are miserable. let em
[2:44:19] knappster15: Ppl don't understand Pika is doing less dps cuz of double disarm and clones
[2:44:23] lordelenath: and no, im not trolling. im honestly curious.
[2:44:26] mat4th: thinks pika is bad because he got out damaged by other rogues
[2:44:33] Telarius1: playstyle prob
[2:44:34] frazzoqt: Cuz he faced bomy
[2:44:35] lordelenath: i dont think hes bad
[2:44:38] nutz_hang_uneven: lmao
[2:44:39] lazyturtle0824: There’s several factors. Comp based. Trill is focused on damage. Pika comp is more cc and setup. He’s also sitting 14 + clones a game and Trill is not.
[2:44:40] frazzoqt: ofc hes gonna do lower dmg
[2:44:41] AdamHeron12: CC
[2:44:41] Six_awc: disarms/clone
[2:44:42] Zeniticon: damage isnt allways the winnign factor
[2:44:42] hooqs: hes such a demon they gotta send all cc on him
[2:44:42] leroylol: every other rogue was outlaw no?
[2:44:43] NightMunchies: cause hes damnn good
[2:44:47] pharmztko: KEKW
[2:44:49] jacob_the_mage: HURP DURP I DO DMG ZUG ZUG GAME IS ABOUT NUMBERS ZUG ZUG
[2:44:49] AdamHeron12: not always about damage
[2:44:49] Crucaider: He was being CC'd. 4head
[2:44:50] Merkflare: He DIdnT dO dAmaGE
[2:44:52] SweatyDaniels: ez answer, Absterge is best shaman NA
[2:44:56] reaperz14: Cause of wizk's damage
[2:44:57] knappster15: it's almost like doing top dam doesnt matter
[2:44:57] xilyx2: people think you do the same damage chasing a boomie around as chasing an sp LUL
[2:44:58] allenlondon210: wizk did that damage because pika just peeled
[2:44:59] cyborg1141: Pika good ass awareness
[2:45:01] Zerksyera: cant believ how many were trash talking pikas dmg in awc chat
[2:45:02] TINSTAAFL: maybe his team did better than the other teams
[2:45:02] Badasti: Pikabro is a god damn leg and nobody will convince me otherwise
[2:45:02] soddi: absterge 3:1
[2:45:07] codyallyn: he won because wiz was scripting?  killing totems before anyone could see them (even in super slow motion rewound how many times)?
[2:45:07] Cerebryx: critical thinking? in this climate?
[2:45:08] NightMunchies: so  like others said dont neeed damage to win
[2:45:09] Six_awc: pika walked so wiz could run
[2:45:10] fistweaveurnan: @reaperz14 How do you think Wizk was able to do that damage? pikas control buddy
[2:45:14] PromiscuousToilet: Hot take. Pika isnt top 3 rogues
[2:45:16] SammyLettuce: how does no one remember Liquid swapping comp and pika instantly doing more avg damage for that whole last game
[2:45:17] nightmxz: Oh I forgot to say great job casting as always rukiLove The casting team always killing it
[2:45:17] theodeth: take a ride in one of those love boats!
[2:45:18] skez_live: double cheap shot peeling your healer or other dps doesnt do dmg on the meters
[2:45:26] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet who cares
[2:45:28] llseattlell: ven in terms of pika where does he stand in the top rogues.
[2:45:29] drummond777: wizk went dumb thou
[2:45:32] Polyrhythmz: pika was cloned for half the tourny
[2:45:32] llseattlell: since everyone is going ham on this
[2:45:33] StromicusRex: oatmeal time
[2:45:35] jacob_the_mage: remember when Abni got rank 1 by being a sheep bot? Just sayin
[2:45:36] zachgamegodx: ven mentioned many times that the "quirky plays' of absterge was absolutely staggering
[2:45:37] PromiscuousToilet: @nutz_hang_uneven i was hoping someone would KEKW
[2:45:38] ItsBees: Oatmeal Pog
[2:45:40] NightMunchies: np take your time
[2:45:48] ryanwars17: pika was talking about his dam, he said its cuz liquid was playing double disarm and clones
[2:45:52] mat4th: its actually nuts
[2:45:53] StromicusRex: obviously carried Kapp
[2:45:54] lordelenath: no, ofc he's good @venruki !
[2:45:57] NightMunchies: hes Awesome pika is a god rogue
[2:45:57] blkylol: dick riding is crazy
[2:45:58] goesidd: 1 guy is
[2:45:59] lordelenath: Its just curious, thats all
[2:45:59] zachgamegodx: ven go collect your thoughts buddy
[2:46:00] schnapp61: wiz kill the totems before they set it
[2:46:02] zachgamegodx: take a break
[2:46:04] Stoichulk: double disarm and clones is the answer
[2:46:04] blkylol: pika is goated
[2:46:08] DeityRevert: also normal for wow because everyone focusing on dps meter
[2:46:08] llseattlell: my problem is theyre commentating how his damage was lower then everyone but his CONTROL of the fight is what makes him standout he controls every aspect at all times.
[2:46:10] gotham_kr: Pikaboo made a pact with the Void Lord Wizk: Wins the AWC at the cost of 50% of his dmg.
[2:46:11] Hobblefoot: Any one person saying Pika not being good should be black-listed from chats everywhere.
[2:46:14] pharmztko: pika currently the best na
[2:46:17] bollskis: double disarm, stuns, cyclones, etc
[2:46:21] llseattlell: like correct me if im wrong but from analyzation he literally controls the tide of the arenas at all times.
[2:46:22] bollskis: chat is fried lol
[2:46:24] DougyfreshGG: damage is a variable that helps influence an outcome, it is not the only variable...
[2:46:24] nutz_hang_uneven: pika > whazz
[2:46:27] tarth_100: he was either disarmed or cloned
[2:46:28] nutz_hang_uneven: na >> eu
[2:46:29] maenkins: cheap shot, kidney, disarm, etc.
[2:46:32] Six_awc: one of the games sam landed like 30 clones or something
[2:46:33] PromiscuousToilet: @illiteratex it certianly wasnt wizk doing the same dmg as the other team combined
[2:46:35] PsyqoSupreme: against rogue boomy they have 2 disarms being spammed on pikaboo - also focusing on control
[2:46:38] Plackoz: double disarm stunned cloned
[2:46:40] lazyturtle0824: @bollskis Yea, not rocket science
[2:46:40] NightMunchies: exactly
[2:46:41] nightmxz: Pika was playing shut down and getting shut down, it's a trade off lol
[2:46:44] drummond777: and double disarm
[2:46:50] Badasti: This is the same kind of glad chat from the Warcraft channel... I just tune it out after a while
[2:46:51] lordelenath: yeah, vs boomkin i wasnt so surprised. but he was also outdamaged vs. rogue/lock.
[2:46:51] theodeth: can you afk in the love boat?
[2:46:52] Hobblefoot: Pika explained that in his stream last night.  He made some gear and stat distributions that were not optimal.  Unless he was trolling.
[2:46:53] themax914: themax914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[2:46:55] jubitor1: @venruki did u guys find out what happened to CDEW's spirit link in AWC vs The move?
[2:46:56] ilavayoutv: they should show a cc chain counter post match like they do with death breakdowns
[2:46:57] llseattlell: i think pika is the #1 in terms of the fact he can literally control the narrative of an arena . his damage is subpar yes but his control of literally everything is insane.
[2:46:58] NozakGaming: Ven it was really entertaining listening to the excite in your voice when casting games yesterday. had everyone hyped.
[2:46:59] ItsBees: Ven the holiday stuff just started Pog new tmogs
[2:46:59] nightmxz: Most of the death logs didn't even have pika in them because he was CC'ing Cdew for 14secs straight
[2:47:04] dvoraklol: just be here now
[2:47:05] NightMunchies: pika shutting down everyone to get SMASHED
[2:47:05] modhan87: The move won yesterday ?
[2:47:05] caulibrower: This mog is so good
[2:47:05] What_ln_Tarnation: why is your char so sexy rn?
[2:47:07] lilskeets: how bout the upset in europe though, that was fun to watch
[2:47:07] PromiscuousToilet: Yall think pika is abnormally good compared to other rogues. hes not lol
[2:47:09] llseattlell: imo never seen someone do that lol
[2:47:10] lordelenath: anyway, i didnt wanna hate on anybody. pika is awesome. i was just curious.
[2:47:11] GoldenA_: Why doesn't sterge just kick the clones for pika Kappa
[2:47:21] jacob_the_mage: me  zug zug and get big number on meter zug zug
[2:47:22] wyldeshock: venruki didn't lose 1 game this weekend
[2:47:23] snacks_23: y did the qb that lose throw more yards than qb that won?
[2:47:23] NightMunchies: THATS WHY PIKA IS A GOD
[2:47:26] TINSTAAFL: this was the best casted awc I’ve seen imo
[2:47:26] ghantous: it was such a hype tourney NE and EU
[2:47:31] figurines: you did a great job casting for sure. well done
[2:47:31] PromiscuousToilet: The skill difference between the top players is minimal. Pika has no excuse
[2:47:32] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet you like ranking men
[2:47:33] jubitor1: @venruki did u guys find out what happened to CDEW's spirit link in AWC vs The move?
[2:47:35] nightmxz: @GoldenA_ I know you're memeing but try kicking Samiyam holy fuck it's hard
[2:47:39] dvoraklol: how do u get that hat tramsmog?
[2:47:42] mat4th: @PromiscuousToilet this guy is delusional lmao. Pika wins tourney. HeS NoT tHaT goOd gUYsss
[2:47:43] JNE14: Hello @venruki I can't wait to see the balance changes that come out of this.
[2:47:48] cyborg1141: Ccs healer for 15 seconds. Where was ur damage?
[2:47:48] PromiscuousToilet: @nutz_hang_uneven and you are uncomfy with your own sexuality and it makes you uncomfortable. Fuck off ;)
[2:47:50] NozakGaming: echo getting knocked out was amazing.
[2:47:50] Gauvy: @PromiscuousToilet he has no excuse for what?  Winning llol?
[2:47:51] zachgamegodx: luminosity used to be the kryptonite to the move in this kinda meta and now they're gona
[2:47:59] skez_live: Pika is probably the best pure rogue that goes by feel and flow of the game.  hes not like a student of the game where hes like minmaxing everything, he just plays
[2:48:00] llseattlell: im trynna figure out why everyones trashing pika like he wouldnt literally smoke all of us lol
[2:48:03] Hobblefoot: Do you all think Wizk did all that damage alone?  Pikaboo helped make that happen with peels and cc's that allowed Wiz to cast more freely. He sacrificed some damage to create more damage.
[2:48:04] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet ghay?
[2:48:06] mat4th: @PromiscuousToilet this guy needs a timeout
[2:48:16] NightMunchies: when i shutdown the other team from doing anything makes its Simple for the other 2 or 1 to own em
[2:48:17] jubitor1: stop spamming him man! let him answer my question! i want to know if spirit link bugged in the tourny!
[2:48:19] DouzySham: @PromiscuousToilet Their comp just demands a different playstyle. I think it was cdew who commented on why Pika was doing so little damage - because Sam was doing all of the CC with cyclone so Trill didn't have to, and Trill could focus on damage instead. Pika had to do all the CC so wiz could do damage
[2:48:26] PromiscuousToilet: @nutz_hang_uneven nope. but doenst make me uncomfy either so your commentary about ranking men does not affect me in the slightest
[2:48:36] xilyx2: i hate when chat is full of actually stupid shit because it means i cant troll.
[2:48:47] NightMunchies: thats how pika's playing
[2:48:48] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet you're the one ranking men not me
[2:48:50] averyyi: @jubitor1 I think he’s ignoring your question lol
[2:48:51] Six_awc: @jubitor1 SLT didnt bug, wizk was ready for it and sniped it, very fast
[2:48:53] nutz_hang_uneven: all im saying
[2:48:54] pharmztko: chat smoking DMT
[2:48:54] knappster15: I'm so thankful we get the opinions of all the 1600 heroes in chat
[2:49:02] nutz_hang_uneven: @pharmztko fav drug
[2:49:09] jacob_the_mage: me zug zug I get big number zug zug I good at game zug zug
[2:49:09] jubitor1: no way it gets sniped with both of them in it man
[2:49:10] PromiscuousToilet: @nutz_hang_uneven okay im gay. what your next comment?
[2:49:13] lordelenath: @knappster15 I'm asking questions. asking questions is a way of learning.
[2:49:14] jubitor1: it would atleast tick
[2:49:19] ItsBees: Can y'all relax?
[2:49:23] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet lmao
[2:49:26] ItsBees: and talk about anything else
[2:49:28] NightMunchies: ask questions wont hurt
[2:49:30] Hobblefoot: Pika gets 2400 on every spec in the game last season and was Rank 1 on multiple specs no less.  Hahaha yeah dude is trash.  Sigh.
[2:49:31] SweatyDaniels: yoooo Rogues getting Redirect in SoD phase 2??? thats OmegaBIS
[2:49:33] Merkflare: this is the most attention they get in their lives
[2:49:37] Merkflare: dont feed them
[2:49:44] malvarcla: can we talk about politics instead
[2:49:45] PromiscuousToilet: @Hobblefoot bet you almost every r1 player can do that.
[2:50:05] NightMunchies: no politics
[2:50:09] nutz_hang_uneven: @malvarcla what should we dive into
[2:50:09] StromicusRex: we need to find another food conversation to derail the chat again
[2:50:20] jubitor1: go talk politics with piers morgan pls, we here to game and have fun
[2:50:24] ItsBees: Pineapple on certain pizzas is okay
[2:50:27] StromicusRex: runny oatmeal vs thicc oatmeal
[2:50:27] SweatyDaniels: do you ever eat a banana and think, hell yeah i could do this
[2:50:32] Six_awc: @jubitor1 i mean it was literally a once in a lifetime play
[2:50:33] Badasti: @StromicusRex Just say what food you think is S tier, that will trigger someone LUL
[2:50:35] jacob_the_mage: Dude got 124 rank 1s, got 30 trophies, praised by many, but nahhh dude is trash.... #LOGIC
[2:50:36] StromicusRex: Bees please, anything but that
[2:50:38] malvarcla: @ItsBees how would pika eat it?
[2:50:39] pharmztko: ribeye better than filet mignon
[2:50:40] blkylol: STEAK OR CHICKEN?
[2:50:41] nutz_hang_uneven: @SweatyDaniels do you throat it? or bite
[2:50:41] NightMunchies: no pineapples on pizza eww gross
[2:50:44] dvoraklol: anyone in chat, is that hat transmog from?
[2:50:51] ZhangTuShi: @SweatyDaniels just had 2 definitely
[2:50:52] DouzySham: It's funny when literally all the tournament competitors, including Team Liquid, and all the casters say Wiz is just good, yet everyone on twitch still thinks Wiz cheated
[2:50:54] Hobblefoot: @PromiscuousToilet And?  Even if that is true... That is supposed to diminish it?  Get outta hear with that nonsense.
[2:50:57] clyptico: My favorite part was when you were screaming the ccs only on hook point for liquid vs the move
[2:50:59] NightMunchies: chicken ftw
[2:51:08] StromicusRex: steak easy
[2:51:09] ItsBees: Can you all argue about nothing in your dms instead of chat Sadge
[2:51:12] blkylol: @NightMunchies yessir
[2:51:12] OutlandishOW: imagine being mad pika won awc and rank 1 solo
[2:51:16] SweatyDaniels: if you eat less than 200 g of protein every day, dont type in chat plz
[2:51:28] NightMunchies: can be created anyway u like  steak u just fry up or bbq
[2:51:48] jacob_the_mage: Imagine being a 1200 andy calling pika bad LOLLLLLLLLL thats like some random bum on the streets calling bill gates broke
[2:51:50] PromiscuousToilet: @Hobblefoot thats not my argument. Im arguing pika isnt abnormally good compared to other r1 players but a lot of his fans seem to think he is
[2:51:51] NightMunchies: thats not fun food  chicken is
[2:51:53] Badasti: I dont care what anyone says, I love Pika, it's a pity he's a filthy Rogue though. Mages are better
[2:52:05] tbergzy: @PromiscuousToilet awc cup champ 1 btw
[2:52:07] mat4th: @PromiscuousToilet bro your opinions have zero weight at this point. you clearly can't touch reality lmao
[2:52:10] NightMunchies: pika is awesome
[2:52:20] StromicusRex: it's not working @ItsBees !!
[2:52:25] ItsBees: >.<
[2:52:35] ItsBees: Ven just needs to ban the word Pika from his chat now
[2:52:36] jacob_the_mage: Enough about Pika... let's talk about Tika
[2:52:39] SweatyDaniels: its almost like AWC chat gets addicted to the rush they get on AWC weekend and has to get their fix here when its over
[2:52:41] jacob_the_mage: Tika marsala
[2:52:41] OutlandishOW: guys wait promiscuous toilet is typing we all need to agree
[2:52:48] StromicusRex: well earlier it was about wiz, so they'd just change the subject lol
[2:53:00] tbergzy: everyone playing in awc broadcast
[2:53:01] StromicusRex: people just salty the move won OMEGALUL
[2:53:03] tbergzy: is insane player
[2:53:04] Nachofez: people who call him bad are upset because they got farmed by him, ez
[2:53:05] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet bruh you hate to much
[2:53:06] Badasti: @StromicusRex nooooo you're going to get the conspiracy theorists started again
[2:53:08] NightMunchies: why ban the Best rogue name in Ven's chat  ..
[2:53:11] OutlandishOW: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[2:53:17] StromicusRex: sorry sorry
[2:53:18] StromicusRex: uhhhh
[2:53:24] PromiscuousToilet: Pika isnt top 3. Ban me KEKW
[2:53:28] mat4th: @StromicusRex its not "people" its one 1200 andy that hates pika for some reason
[2:53:29] StromicusRex: why is pork the worst red meat
[2:53:34] wizkx: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[2:53:36] SweatyDaniels: who are the 5 greatest rappers of all time?
[2:53:41] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet this guy sucks
[2:53:46] OutlandishOW: isn’t top 3 is a really weird way to say #1
[2:53:47] DouzySham: @wizkx pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[2:53:49] lazyturtle0824: Wiz!
[2:53:50] malvarcla: well yeah because the move cheated right Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:53:54] jacob_the_mage: I'm not a rapper... so stop rappin at me
[2:53:57] PromiscuousToilet: @mat4th its less the haters and more the worshipers that cause the issues
[2:53:57] nutz_hang_uneven: the move did cheat
[2:54:00] SweatyDaniels: @wizkx <3 W stergeWs
[2:54:03] Badasti: @wizkx omfg it's the leg
[2:54:04] StromicusRex: oh my gooooood
[2:54:04] averyyi: TotemGate?
[2:54:05] jayhendrix47: how many times do we think Pika has farmed this guy?
[2:54:05] DouzySham: @wizkx Everyone is still arguing about you lol
[2:54:18] StromicusRex: ven make it stop we can't control them anymore BibleThump
[2:54:18] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet did this guy get gatekept 1400 by pika
[2:54:20] Hobblefoot: @PromiscuousToilet That is a fair opinion but a subjective one.  The data to back up any arguement like that would be very hard to do because people could counter it with similar data.  I will say this. The debate was not "Is Pika as good as other R1 players"  It is a matter of of correcting people who say he is a bad player (in general) based on his damage in the finals.
[2:54:20] ItsBees: I'ma bout to spend a million points just to do emote only D:
[2:54:23] Badasti: A rare Wizk has appeared in chat
[2:54:25] pharmztko: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove

[2:54:43] NightMunchies: em kids
[2:54:48] OutlandishOW: shun the non believers
[2:54:51] Xeliumimar: they buffed the drop rate of love rocket again
[2:54:52] ATHLTE: ggs casting yesteray ven did super well!!
[2:54:57] DouzySham: If you want to claim cheating, show evidence
[2:55:00] StromicusRex: u right, time to bring out the hammers
[2:55:01] ImJordanHi: What's all this SOD 2 content? Did they release a date or something?

[2:55:32] theodeth: you have unspent dragonriding glyphs

[2:55:40] ImJordanHi: @StromicusRex Ahhh, are they doing updates to SOD on thursdays? Weird it's not on a Tuesday
[2:55:47] Six_awc: That AWC felt like grand finals somehow, with how close the games were
[2:55:53] SonexaM: that EU finals yesterday was awesome! I was almost asleep when Echo got eliminated. I was wide awake after. scared
[2:55:54] NightMunchies: i agree
[2:55:56] StromicusRex: yeah its a little strange
[2:55:58] SonexaM: scared my son
[2:55:59] ATHLTE: so many exciting teams
[2:56:02] mat4th: lol one dude is trolling hard in chat

[2:56:27] Badasti: he's just living up to his name
[2:56:31] NightMunchies: lots of moose in vens backyard lmao
[2:56:31] nutz_hang_uneven: @StromicusRex that guy sucks
[2:56:42] blessedgodriley: Ven do u have some fist weapons to play some enhance?
[2:56:42] malvarcla: its not me please dont hurt me
[2:56:45] Hobblefoot: Prediction:  You will see SP, Resto Sham and Rogue get nerfs after those results.  You know just like last season after The Move won back to back circuits.
[2:56:45] StromicusRex: yeah well my nuts are perfectly even
[2:56:48] ATHLTE: ww sub was fun to watch
[2:56:48] jubitor1: @venruki did u guys find out what happened to CDEW's spirit link in AWC vs The move?
[2:56:52] littledealerxxx: surprised no one brought out the triple evoked comp… clearly the best comp this season
[2:56:55] PromiscuousToilet: ban me. They mad cuz i said other r1s are comparable to pika but pika fans mad that i didnt say hes the 2nd coming.
[2:56:58] sufiro: EU was way ahead in terms of unpredictability, which adds to excitement
[2:57:01] ImJordanHi: What mace is that? I can't tell if its an enchant or the color, looks cool
[2:57:02] lilskeets: yea both were fire, good games this weekend
[2:57:08] nutz_hang_uneven: @PromiscuousToilet nobody cares bro

[2:57:35] skez_live: food delivery!
[2:57:38] Hobblefoot: @PromiscuousToilet I think they misunderstood your point. They thought you suggested he is generally bad.
[2:57:41] hcrzealot: @venruki Great job this weekend! ✊🏾
[2:57:42] carneasada34: @SonexaM it has like 20k health
[2:57:43] dpsEric: Cdew wasnt actually in the link for the first tick because the animation is super delayed, and Wizk killed it before it ticked again
[2:57:51] jacob_the_mage: bro play demo lock
[2:57:52] Schiimon: @Maldre SW:Pain mouseover macro

[2:58:09] jubitor1: dude how to u kill a spirit link before it ticks!
[2:58:14] jubitor1: cant be real!
[2:58:17] skez_live: tren is always giving the DH secret sauce in his guides
[2:58:24] sufiro: wizk uses mouse for a lot it seems - he's just a pro with the cursor
[2:58:28] DouzySham: @jubitor1 it's a garbage CD with a huge delay
[2:58:34] eMBeaR64oz: inner demon is from chaos strike
[2:58:35] D_Tram: you want to essence break before 2 blade dance and 1 chaos strike @venruki
[2:58:37] Nickystr1x: what did you learn? that if you press eye beam and the hunt you do top damage and kill the entire team?
[2:58:39] OutlandishOW: eye beam chaos strike ess break death sweep meta death sweep chaos strike eye beam chaos strike
[2:58:39] NightMunchies: 300 demons sounds like *hell*
[2:58:40] mvpJ_: i thought inner demon procs off chaos strike
[2:58:42] OutlandishOW: that’s the tech
[2:58:45] jubitor1: doesnt SLT tick automatically though?
[2:58:46] Badasti: @wizkx when is the SP guide coming out?
[2:58:47] ezro_91: @venruki what guide did you watch?
[2:58:48] jacob_the_mage: dude after I ate taco bell I witnessed an inner demon ....
[2:58:52] ImJordanHi: Was it a MVQ guide or a Tren guide? The DH king is up for dispute
[2:58:56] gelatokush: make sense dh is a very complex class takes yrs to fully understand the depth of the spec MyAvatar
[2:59:09] xilyx2: @ImJordanHi is it?
[2:59:15] NightMunchies: after u eat that u bet body does weird things

[2:59:19] OutlandishOW: double death sweep under ess break is a secret tech
[2:59:22] bogeii: who’s *

[2:59:29] ImJordanHi: @xilyx2 lol idk, I just heard them talking about it the other day
[2:59:31] D_Tram: @ImJordanHi well Tren is CEO of DH and MVQ is best atm so both respectable and knowledgable
[2:59:39] xilyx2: @ImJordanHi LUL
[2:59:39] SweatyDaniels: only EU has serious DH. NA DH players are meme
[2:59:41] lilskeets: RIP retail Savix
[2:59:42] Zeniticon: is mvq the CEO ?
[2:59:43] NightMunchies: a what?

[3:00:10] Squantanimo: I recently learned how important armageddon is after eye beam/meta
[3:00:12] Nickystr1x: mesidan dont want that smoke
[3:00:13] Feanorian: @venruki have you ever made a tier list based on skill required to play spec?
[3:00:14] Squantanimo: b/c of inner demon proc
[3:00:14] jacob_the_mage: hard to take DH seriously lol
[3:00:20] Squantanimo: didn't realize that dam i was sometimes missing
[3:00:21] OutlandishOW: true lmao rex
[3:00:28] SonexaM: love the mog ven. you always have good mogs.
[3:00:36] SweatyDaniels: ok you caught me trolling DH zoomers again
[3:00:38] rivellana: that dh is missing some clothing
[3:00:47] Hobblefoot: @OutlandishOW You hate all of chat and blame the 'community' for when individuals make comments. Please! We are not all like them trolls!  I stand with you!
[3:00:48] StromicusRex: ven's chat is generally pretty chill, until the awc happens Kapp
[3:00:51] NightMunchies: that 1 is naked
[3:00:52] ImJordanHi: Vanguards seems like such a nice person, I rarely go to his stream but he just always seems like a genuinely nice person
[3:01:08] pharmztko: samiBoom samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS2
[3:01:09] jacob_the_mage: Bro we vibin in here wym?
[3:01:11] Reuhn: we are not chill peepoRiot
[3:01:15] BMaStream: I'm cooler than a cucumber oshstrEz
[3:01:16] OutlandishOW: @hobblefoot i generally watch twitch with chat closed. need to turn phone sideways again
[3:01:20] D_Tram: stop feeding the trolllls
[3:01:24] KannedTuna: @ImJordanHi I misread this as Crusader and thought it was a great troll
[3:01:31] ImJordanHi: @KannedTuna LMFAO
[3:01:44] StromicusRex: got damn
[3:01:51] lilskeets: do you think DH deserves all the hate it gets?
[3:01:52] Moobot: Latest video "The Casual PvP Community Is Begging For Help" view it here: youtu.be/ztKSy4IjNfo
[3:01:54] pharmztko: WOW A FEAST
[3:01:54] soothingmistmonk: Why is it your mog on your dh looks super good!
[3:01:55] SonexaM: I need to do some PvP tonight after my kids are in bed.
[3:01:55] PromiscuousToilet: @OutlandishOW on the phone the chat is ahead of what you see. For whatever reason the app has a big delay with video
[3:01:57] hcrzealot: @venruki whoa, that is a feast!
[3:01:57] ImJordanHi: Vocal minority
[3:01:57] SweatyDaniels: damn those macros are on point
[3:01:58] NightMunchies: holy fk u eat everything in your home
[3:02:06] shahriar_fenix: Hi hi
[3:02:12] skez_live: I thought I might be hyped for p2 SoD but AWC just has me thinking about arenas lol
[3:02:14] NightMunchies: thats alota food
[3:02:15] ImJordanHi: Is that a Mythic sweater? Like Mythic raiding? Where'd you get that
[3:02:15] skez_live: dont know if I'll play
[3:02:17] vethx: did you ever get an interview why nobody wants to play mages
[3:02:23] Badasti: man I need to queue some shuffs and have no idea what to play
[3:02:25] snacks_23: @venruki are u married?
[3:02:27] StromicusRex: ven you're well known for listening to the vocal minority. anytime one random says your music sucks, you insta change it PepeHands
[3:02:33] NightMunchies: id get sick after a bowl of aotmeal
[3:02:36] xilyx2: but cdew said mage was broken!
[3:02:37] vethx: or just wizards in AWC
[3:02:38] NightMunchies: oat
[3:02:38] StromicusRex: he is @snacks_23
[3:02:41] soothingmistmonk: you think arcane getting nerfed?
[3:02:45] hcrzealot: @venruki Do you have any go to snacks when you’re casting for the AWC?
[3:02:46] GoldenA_: i thought every team that could was gonna play arcane outlaw
[3:02:47] carneasada34: Saw a lot of arcane mages dying
[3:02:49] SonexaM: did you get the end mog from trading post yet?
[3:02:54] pharmztko: dewLUL
[3:02:54] altilla187: the rare ven Dh. Most of been getting some good lobbies today before the swap to dh
[3:02:56] jacob_the_mage: junglejape makes people hate arcane
[3:02:57] panasiuk97: Raiku didn't seem unviable?
[3:03:02] Nickystr1x: the 1 arcane mage was able to kite the DH until he hit is enrage timer and got omega blasted
[3:03:02] fistweaveurnan: Oh but u will the 7th when crusaders last stand takes the big win with rmpal
[3:03:03] nightmxz: @StromicusRex I believe it's called "getting one guy'd" I don't watch too many streamers though so not sure
[3:03:04] xilyx2: LOOOL
[3:03:05] sourbutts: we not gonna talk about how Europe just ZugZug their way to W
[3:03:06] ImJordanHi: It looks a bit warm for those boots I will say, looks like you're in a desert
[3:03:06] soothingmistmonk: Buff enhance?
[3:03:08] NightMunchies: idfk
[3:03:15] lilskeets: is DH propaganda valid?
[3:03:17] SweatyDaniels: how does magikarp go from being so useless to being one of the most godly pokemon ever to exist
[3:03:22] sourbutts: echo played it and lost for the first time in 10 yuea
[3:03:25] sourbutts: years
[3:03:26] NightMunchies: why didnt we see it
[3:03:29] carneasada34: @soothingmistmonk needs less sustained dam and more of a one shot for sure
[3:03:31] zlovett08: the Sterge kill with burrow was my fave part of the cup
[3:03:31] hcrzealot: I saw a lot of melee cleaves 👀👀
[3:03:33] 4Liqur: but nerf rogue
[3:03:35] chaosemperor77: hoolibang was like hold my beer arcane outlaw
[3:03:38] Guettalx: crazy to think the best team lost with that comp
[3:03:38] altilla187: did riaku play frost?
[3:03:38] ImJordanHi: What's the best place to buy Duck Boots?
[3:03:42] tarth_100: I was surprised to see more destro over arcane
[3:03:42] StromicusRex: @SweatyDaniels gyarados has 4x weakness to electric, it sucks ass
[3:03:44] ATHLTE: 100% nerf rogue lmao
[3:03:45] sppttv: The mages are conspiring to wait until the finals.
[3:03:46] NightMunchies: more rogues than anything this trip
[3:03:47] GoldenA_: @zlovett08 one the most legendary kills
[3:03:48] SonexaM: I honestly feel classes can viable if the players knows how to play the class and spec very well.
[3:03:54] soothingmistmonk: @carneasada34 Needs survivability
[3:03:55] Badasti: I just want 1 AWC that isn't a competition to see what the best Rogue sidekick class is
[3:03:59] OutlandishOW: and we all still hate DH :)
[3:04:03] sourbutts: @altilla187 not a chance, i do thin they shouldve played frost into sub ww tho
[3:04:06] 4Liqur: lol but boomy top dmgs, clones every other gcd, and sits in bear form
[3:04:06] beeftip: Did we see a non rogue team make it to either finals?
[3:04:08] 4Liqur: lol
[3:04:08] sparqTTV: yeah combat is insane
[3:04:09] 4Liqur: jesus
[3:04:10] ImJordanHi: Whazz answered that, he said mage is just less damage than warlock
[3:04:10] sparqTTV: sub on the other hand lol
[3:04:15] carneasada34: @soothingmistmonk I was being sarcastic, but yes it does need more defense
[3:04:15] nightmxz: Not gonna lie I think if Raiku Whazz played frost sub and played to set up I think they could have won, frost bomb burst with sub damage is absurd
[3:04:16] MisterThatDude: I kinda want rogue to be bad for a couple seasons
[3:04:16] Hobblefoot: Not true.
[3:04:19] llseattlell: ww better then dh change my mind kekw
[3:04:21] SweatyDaniels: @StromicusRex gyarados still the undefeated throat goat
[3:04:22] lilskeets: nah rogues suck, didn't you see pika's dmg /s
[3:04:25] NightMunchies: best sidekick for a rogue is a Hpriest
[3:04:25] StromicusRex: LOL
[3:04:33] whittyxo: @llseattlell ww infinitely better than all the fotm dh rerolls
[3:04:34] Hobblefoot: Another rogue (with WW) beat rogue as well to be fair.
[3:04:36] sourbutts: @nightmxz theres 0 chance that frost bomb goes off
[3:04:39] Dexlol123: venruki didnt trust dh warr could beat rmd
[3:04:48] nikthevoker: ya but DH does big dam
[3:04:49] soothingmistmonk: Raiku is playing shadow priest
[3:04:52] fistweaveurnan: the floor man the floor
[3:04:57] knadam13: outlaw nerfs inc?
[3:05:01] SweatyDaniels: Hot Take: Mehhx hard carried echo, confirmed?
[3:05:03] TINSTAAFL: bro we’re all playing SP now
[3:05:04] SonexaM: Saw the shoutout to Greenlizard
[3:05:05] Hobblefoot: Outlaw is crazy in a different way.  Outlaw damage cannot compete with DH most of the time.
[3:05:08] nikthevoker: dev/DH my fav comp
[3:05:08] dominari9: I was confused how DH doesn't die to rogue there
[3:05:09] Badasti: thats true, but the one saving grace is that outlaw is quite rough to play. I'm pretty sure I could train my cat to play my DH
[3:05:13] altilla187: @sourbutts what spec did he play they did play rmd
[3:05:14] llseattlell: ven what class do you really not play at all?
[3:05:16] 7osei: Melee cleaves used to be good for countering rogue teams
[3:05:19] ImJordanHi: Why do people even care? I swear most people are like 2400 and you can get any spec to that rating currently
[3:05:19] nightmxz: @sourbutts You think if Raiku and Whaazz are cross-cc'ing a team with lontar playing rdruid and cloning off of instant cc that frost bomb won't go off?
[3:05:21] SweatyDaniels: no flame of course
[3:05:26] Magottx: It was so cool how they were playing it imo. setting up goes like rmp lol
[3:05:27] sourbutts: @TINSTAAFL if anyone knows how wizk does all that damage please tell me
[3:05:27] jacob_the_mage: feel like outlaw shouldn't get nerfed but thats my take
[3:05:27] Dexlol123: we usually did better as ele dh vs rmd, but if we pick ele dh they just pick outlaw lock and we lose
[3:05:28] NightMunchies: what is the best sidekick for rogue? if u laugh that Hpriest could be
[3:05:30] SonexaM: No everyone can have an opinion
[3:05:32] xz6969: u playin sod p2?
[3:05:32] Magottx: with unhinged goes
[3:05:33] sourbutts: @nightmxz yes
[3:05:37] knadam13: @sweatydaniels not hard carried but definitely pulled his weight
[3:05:41] whittyxo: @sourbutts consistently dotting all targets, all it is lmao
[3:05:44] schdenfreude: @sweatydaniels echo lost cup 1 and 3 last season so they weren't unbeatable like everyone thinks
[3:05:47] ATHLTE: cant believe hpriest won EU tho
[3:05:50] fovven: mehhh is just next level man
[3:05:51] zlovett08: boosted an out the other day, 20 minutes to set up bars and send conquest boxes, 5-1 in my first solo. outlaw is cracked.
[3:05:56] nightmxz: @sourbutts so all 3 targets being cc'd frost bomb still won't go off lmao
[3:05:58] GoldenA_: @whittyxo i think a lot of it is mind trauma too lol
[3:05:59] NightMunchies: ww won
[3:06:01] PromiscuousToilet: @SweatyDaniels lontar is obviously great. maybe it was just less time played together so not as synced?
[3:06:02] llseattlell: veeeennnn whats your worst class?
[3:06:07] nikthevoker: more no name winners
[3:06:13] ImJordanHi: Whazz said Lontar played well, Chan played well, they just got out comped and were'nt prepared
[3:06:15] pharmztko: f tier of EU
[3:06:18] NightMunchies: DK
[3:06:19] xilyx2: i think sub rogue had a lot to do with that LUL
[3:06:19] engzyng: holy priest
[3:06:20] jacob_the_mage: @venruki mage
[3:06:20] engzyng: :D
[3:06:22] BMaStream: Honestly, all of the AWC was super exciting. I feel like Boomie games are so boring though
[3:06:22] Badasti: Feral LUL
[3:06:23] StromicusRex: ven is best at all classes
[3:06:23] nightmxz: feral
[3:06:24] jacob_the_mage: @Venruki jk
[3:06:24] beeftip: Ven, how do I warrior against mage? Low rated and every SS lobby today is mage, hunter X, me on arms
[3:06:24] fistweaveurnan: @PromiscuousToilet Definitely out of sync jahmil had a good analysis of it
[3:06:25] zachgamegodx: ele and enhance
[3:06:25] Hobblefoot: If the lot of you could nerf Outlaw, what would you do to nerf it?  Seeing as it is the greatest most over-powered spec of all time (hyperbole)?  Anyone?
[3:06:26] bogeii: shower thoughts: it would actually be so sick if you, supatease and ziqo form an awc team, casters let’s gooo
[3:06:27] pharmztko: feral
[3:06:28] StromicusRex: no wait badasti is right
[3:06:28] whittyxo: mind trauma haste reduc + mass dotting, wiz is just a king of his spec and thats all there is to it
[3:06:29] llseattlell: 250k lemme duel you on dk
[3:06:29] StromicusRex: feral
[3:06:30] zachgamegodx: enhance hunter
[3:06:31] sourbutts: @nightmxz not with any value, youre giving 3 of the best players in the world to stop a 5 second wait time, bro, frost bomb is hard to get to go off in 2k solo shuffle
[3:06:37] Phreshbrew: EU proved that comps don't matter, only friendship does
[3:06:40] NightMunchies: DK u hardly play
[3:06:41] fovven: there was really good class representation, it was a lot more fun to watch then any of the previous 5 cups
[3:06:42] dgeck55: Yo venruki is wizk using totem stomping bot?
[3:06:47] pragma90: mistweaver, prove me wrong and play it :D
[3:06:47] soothingmistmonk: @venruki how are you at demo lock?
[3:06:48] lilskeets: DK/DH didn't look great against the RPS
[3:06:48] StromicusRex: you could be good at feral if you took more than 5 seconds to learn it
[3:06:51] NightMunchies: i think DK or hunter
[3:06:51] SonexaM: I watched Whaazz’s stream after they lost. He was happy to see new people winning. He seems like a great person.
[3:07:03] biofreaks: AWC had decent viewership too,
[3:07:03] PromiscuousToilet: @fistweaveurnan im glad. I find it hard to believe lontar was a net negative on any team.  ive only seen mehh play priest. Did he play other classes?
[3:07:03] Badasti: when are you picking up the Feral dream again Ven?
[3:07:06] llseattlell: i am 100% curious if i can stand a chance with you on you're worst class while im on my best class
[3:07:07] zlovett08: 20k viewers too. badass
[3:07:07] ImJordanHi: That's a hard question because if Hpriest is bad you're a 1800 Hpriest, and if its good you're 2400...
[3:07:12] llseattlell: 250k let me know :D
[3:07:12] Magottx: Actually blows my mind cloak immunity is a thing still
[3:07:16] knadam13: they’re too tanky
[3:07:16] NightMunchies: pick up a dk you'll love it
[3:07:17] ATHLTE: yeah even viewship was high
[3:07:18] nightmxz: @sourbutts I get 80% of my frost bombs off at 2.5-2650 because I cross with them, am I just a miracle worker then? lmao
[3:07:20] GoldenA_: i honestly cant follow the game worth a fuck with kalvish and pika running in circles ccing everyone
[3:07:27] ATHLTE: was a big W for awc and warcraft id say
[3:07:27] schdenfreude: @promiscuoustoilet yea he only plays priest and preservation
[3:07:27] ItsBees: 20k on twitch and like 5k on youtube :D
[3:07:28] waelrick: at one point 30k between twitch and yt
[3:07:29] hawgcast: rogue is a good enabler class, without pika stnning its hard for like SP to go ham
[3:07:33] reaperz14: Cdews hair was lookin great
[3:07:37] llseattlell: feral?
[3:07:39] lilskeets: the only thing I didn't really enjoy watching this weekend was the r druid drinking games, even those were still kinda interesting with the skill required to get a drink off
[3:07:39] ParagonPlayer123: Sheep A and frost bomb Y, there you go.
[3:07:40] PromiscuousToilet: @schdenfreude thanks
[3:07:44] Jihnn: This used to be a Bestmobility stream BibleThump
[3:07:47] NightMunchies: oh i lved 6 dk's to lv 70
[3:07:49] Somanie: Cdews hair was amazing lol
[3:07:51] Smexxin: this used to be a fury warrior shuffle stream BibleThump
[3:07:55] sourbutts: @nightmxz must be. you should go win the AWC as frost mage since its so easy and youre that good.
[3:07:57] Badasti: I think you'd be quite good at SP quite fast
[3:08:01] CardboardCG: cdews hair made me laugh so much that was great
[3:08:03] Badasti: too natural
[3:08:03] StromicusRex: you should get your dk leveled, i wanna see people cry about its name
[3:08:11] llseattlell: log into your s priest
[3:08:11] nikthevoker: well atleast 10k for cdews haircut, made more then winningg AWC LUL
[3:08:13] llseattlell: lets do this
[3:08:15] SonexaM: My middle child was watching it with me because he had a fever. He was so thrilled The Move won. His favorite PvP layer is Pikaboo
[3:08:19] OutlandishOW: frost bomb is dispellable
[3:08:22] sourbutts: shadow priest needs a really good healer
[3:08:23] fistweaveurnan: @PromiscuousToilet He pr much was playing rmp, hes very defense minded. I think some time together they will iron it out
[3:08:23] tony1992qt: or ww/sub
[3:08:26] leroylol: how is ret paladin rn
[3:08:29] llseattlell: ah rip
[3:08:30] llseattlell: LOL
[3:08:35] llseattlell: challenge accepted but im alliance
[3:08:35] jacob_the_mage: Play Buffarcane as demo?
[3:08:40] NightMunchies: no mana no heals -DEAD
[3:08:41] hawgcast: wizk makes SP look so sick
[3:08:42] socbrotes: there were some high viewer count watch parties as well. Max watched a lot of it supporting Liquid for example
[3:08:43] TINSTAAFL: to be fair you don’t need to be good at DH
[3:08:45] PromiscuousToilet: @fistweaveurnan i thought lontar had some amazing clones
[3:08:46] StromicusRex: valdrakken
[3:08:47] knadam13: as an rdruid I don’t like drinking as a mandatory requirement to win
[3:08:49] hawgcast: but then u log it and its hard af haha
[3:08:51] nightmxz: @sourbutts I gotta give the other players a chance, and I said raiku and whaazz could pull it off because of their insane cross :)
[3:08:51] TINSTAAFL: that’s kind of the point of dh
[3:08:57] NightMunchies: yes u do
[3:08:59] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rexcist WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[3:09:02] dakotan517: bad dh is noticeable quick
[3:09:02] xilyx2: mmm ;p;
[3:09:02] lilskeets: DH most hated class
[3:09:07] rexcist: rexcist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[3:09:11] OutlandishOW: DH hate is so annoying dude
[3:09:12] whittyxo: being good at dh = positioning/target choice and managing your 2 cds LOL
[3:09:12] SonexaM: I don’t feel you are bad at Any class ven.
[3:09:14] elpmeme: same as warrior isn't it, wedge something in the keybind to hold w down and press 1 and 2 every now and again
[3:09:17] NightMunchies: just dont pick up a dh think you're the best
[3:09:20] elpmeme: keyboard*
[3:09:20] ImJordanHi: Go to vald and invite to group
[3:09:26] llseattlell: add lilbleeds#1945
[3:09:26] OutlandishOW: new to wow have fun on a class and everyone acts like it’s nothing
[3:09:32] DegStaerian: yoo the AWC was FIRE
[3:09:33] llseattlell: only way i can invite horde
[3:09:33] knadam13: this song is a throwback catJAM
[3:09:35] ImJordanHi: Whazz said they need to buff CC in this game (no troll)
[3:09:44] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy ATHLTE WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[3:09:44] NightMunchies: 2100 dh for ven
[3:09:44] CardboardCG: dh isn’t nearly as easy as people think. you’re paper thin and have to use mobility intentionally
[3:09:47] SaltyBites: high rated (at least 1400)
[3:09:49] xilyx2: 2100 DH.. you must have a doctorate
[3:09:51] sourbutts: @nightmxz they obviously disagree because they wouldve tried it, raiku is best mage in the world at frost and arcane, you think if they thought they could win with it they wouldnt play it?
[3:09:51] llseattlell: coming
[3:09:51] Squantanimo: how many rounds played do you have on 2100?
[3:09:53] pharmztko: ?
[3:09:58] OutlandishOW: Reverse magic is a high skillcap spell
[3:10:01] NightMunchies: you gotta be damn good to play Dh
[3:10:01] whittyxo: @CardboardCG i main ww, i know what being paper thin is like dont worry :p
[3:10:03] 4Liqur: lol DH has a script now just like rogue, they can pre, cc and off cc all on command
[3:10:10] ItsBees: want a rdruid? Pog
[3:10:12] rockxtv: it's an ...echo.. chamber. chan says the same
[3:10:13] soothingmistmonk: Take out all the micro CC and just make it normal
[3:10:13] llseattlell: prepare for demise venruki
[3:10:14] Grimm303: buff gouge and kidney
[3:10:15] carrvve: you want heals or dps
[3:10:17] llseattlell: im in que
[3:10:25] kreyzy8: the healer trinket change to 90 secs wasn't necessary IMO
[3:10:26] llseattlell: yes
[3:10:27] Badasti: yeah buff cc and make healers even more miserable, 30 min queues arent long enough LUL
[3:10:28] MisterThatDude: I feel like they should gut the amount of cc and increase it's duration
[3:10:29] carrvve: oh nvm lol
[3:10:33] jacob_the_mage: I got 1800 on every class ... now to push duelist
[3:10:33] StromicusRex: what a name
[3:10:36] ItsBees: Sadge
[3:10:36] DegStaerian: i almost liked the preshow with peronsal ruki comments more then the official AWC stream
[3:10:36] ImJordanHi: Do you think they need to buff CC in WoW?
[3:10:37] lilskeets: when people are good and CC your eye beam DH is tough to get dmg off against certain comps
[3:10:37] pharmztko: reported
[3:10:40] Somanie: nice name KEKW
[3:10:41] nightmxz: @sourbutts Raiku isn't the best mage at arcane KEKW and they most likely didn't practice it and felt more confident in arcane outlaw
[3:10:42] Final_Griever: @venruki Do WW even get Capstone talents now? I havent played for awhile
[3:10:45] NightMunchies: even evoker takes time to be good
[3:10:49] darksigns94: yoo ven hows the gym going_
[3:10:50] whittyxo: if u report this man ur lame af let him live
[3:10:58] sourbutts: @nightmxz i want whatever youre smoking
[3:11:02] whittyxo: @Final_Griever no we dont take any capstones in the class tree lul its so sad
[3:11:03] notshaney: nice mog
[3:11:09] caulibrower: Any tips for new frost mage player?
[3:11:10] xilyx2: 30 years old.. 15 years old at heart with that name
[3:11:10] Somanie: if you report this man for his monk name, report my rogue name Stare it's Fuqqer
[3:11:31] StromicusRex: my rogue's name got reported Sadge it was kidneyshiddy
[3:11:32] Final_Griever: I hate that so much, like capstones are suppose to be this big strong talent and we get shit lol
[3:11:33] TINSTAAFL: my priest name is WifeFker

[3:12:08] legiontheworgen: wait you can backflip Disarm off?
[3:12:09] Grimm303: LUL
[3:12:14] pharmztko: loooool
[3:12:17] TINSTAAFL: my druids name is PawMcCartney
[3:12:18] whittyxo: im crying for that monk rn what is he doing
[3:12:21] ItsBees: 115k wtf
[3:12:25] Grimm303: can you reverse magic karma dot
[3:12:28] pharmztko: @legiontheworgen ya
[3:12:28] Somanie: broke his ankles
[3:12:28] NightMunchies: thats creative
[3:12:29] Magottx: lol fly in duels with no los is so cheese
[3:12:30] Blitzylive: is this monk trolling?
[3:12:40] whittyxo: he has to be trolling lol
[3:12:47] soothingmistmonk: @venruki Can you host a mog contest?  Winner gets an onstream Q&A with you?
[3:12:48] pharmztko: ?????
[3:12:59] SonexaM: and you say you are bad at DH…..
[3:13:01] Spartapus: ❤️
[3:13:08] 인터넷포트: what was i suppose to do he flew up in the air during my burst
[3:13:13] NightMunchies: no you're not
[3:13:14] Blitzylive: that monk was trolling
[3:13:16] OutlandishOW: that’s the basic script for DH vs ww
[3:13:23] zachgamegodx: win watio'ed
[3:13:24] SonexaM: love the mage mog
[3:13:25] Badasti: bad is relative
[3:13:30] NightMunchies: you're not bad on your dh just think u are
[3:13:35] OutlandishOW: kite serenity, kite karma, his fault he didn’t see a TP somewhere
[3:13:40] OutlandishOW: set
[3:13:46] obviouslytai: 2400
[3:13:46] socbrotes: when was the last retail duel tourney?
[3:13:47] Locturnal_TV: 1600
[3:13:48] Blitzylive: 2700+
[3:13:49] americanmoses18: 2k
[3:13:51] dakotan517: 2500
[3:13:52] elpmeme: 0
[3:13:52] MisterThatDude: 2200
[3:13:53] TINSTAAFL: in ss 2400
[3:13:53] bobbybigbuxx: 2400
[3:13:54] americanmoses18: i feel is good
[3:13:55] jacob_the_mage: 3700
[3:13:58] americanmoses18: 2k is a good spot

[3:14:01] Mik3x_x: 4000
[3:14:01] leeka: 2400 with 1 hand
[3:14:01] Magottx: DH? 2.9 at least
[3:14:04] Badasti: for everyone 1800 is a respectable rating, for you I think 2200
[3:14:04] jacob_the_mage: 5k world first
[3:14:09] SweatyDaniels: sounds like a trick question to me
[3:14:11] DeityRevert: for you, 2.5k
[3:14:17] NightMunchies: 5k WF>
[3:14:17] llseattlell: brother i am not good LOL
[3:14:18] bobbybigbuxx: DH is 2100 ez at your level hilariously easy
[3:14:18] Hobblefoot: Chat needs to understand that @venruki version of 'bad' is still 100x better than most of us here in chat.  His criteria is not a criteria we should use to decide if we are bad.
[3:14:23] lilskeets: people hate on DH so much
[3:14:28] lilskeets: feelsbadman
[3:14:28] xilyx2: deleting DH is only respectable move
[3:14:31] TINSTAAFL: it’s just if dmg is king in SS, then DH is THE best SS class
[3:14:34] obviouslytai: bros be pressin 2 buttons
[3:14:37] jacob_the_mage: I mean I'm a 1800 player and I got 2300 as DH lol
[3:14:38] TINSTAAFL: you don’t need to coordinate with your team
[3:14:40] lilskeets: 2300 DH and constantly get told I'm shit lol
[3:14:40] gelatokush: i play every class i liek my dh
[3:14:41] TINSTAAFL: you just pump
[3:14:42] americanmoses18: i main dk i got to 1800 in solo in 100 rounds....dh i got 1800 in like 35 rounds lol
[3:14:46] 인터넷포트: do u like the new hunt animation
[3:14:48] nikthevoker: im playing at 2.3kcr with DHs that just W healers all game LUL 0 clues found
[3:14:48] NightMunchies: DH's wreck people thats why they hate em lol
[3:15:04] stonedmonkey: @venruki   think well get some hotfixes for next week now that the awc over?
[3:15:08] nikthevoker: real 3s tho
[3:15:10] americanmoses18: dh is just kinda braindead comparative
[3:15:10] xilyx2: i actually dont hate DH at all i just think its funny to bash on the new hunter
[3:15:13] OutlandishOW: @americanmoses18 i got 2300 in 80 rounds on DH but yeah im just bad
[3:15:13] NightMunchies: all of em are playing unholy
[3:15:14] chaosemperor77: they need to buff dk defensive dies way too easy
[3:15:19] obviouslytai: their healing isnt good enough
[3:15:22] NightMunchies: all of em die ofc
[3:15:33] GoldenA_: @nikthevoker have you actually been playing feral/dev/fistweaver lol
[3:15:37] suspicious94: how surprised were you with Howton finding success on sub while every other rogue played outlaw? Eridas on ww too was a huge factor taking down everyone in awc.
[3:15:37] leeka: i like the die option
[3:15:39] bobbybigbuxx: i highly doubt any tuning between cups unless something was egregious. the only thing i could see them doing is increasing healing or mana or something for healers.
[3:15:48] pharmztko: buff Mes
[3:15:53] Badasti: the problem is most melee turned into formula 1 rocket cars and DK's stayed more or less the same
[3:15:59] TINSTAAFL: DH with blur, darkness, glimpse is just so strong in SS. I think in 2s/3s they aren’t super insane. but in SS they are S tier
[3:16:00] elpmeme: @bobbybigbuxx get that pve gear outta there
[3:16:06] obviouslytai: gotta get insane value out of defensives to have a chance
[3:16:06] lilskeets: there are 233 DH above 2300 in SS right now, crazy that all of them are in chat lol
[3:16:14] DevobotOCE: whats up Ven, was fun watching you on the cast over the weekend bro
[3:16:15] nikthevoker: @GoldenA_ no cant find any fisters but i want to, looks good on EU
[3:16:17] PsyqoSupreme: how much do you think the farmer was paid for that watermelon? they're out of season so it probably came from SA - they're large and heavy so shipping them is expensive. think the farmer got more or less than 5 cents for the entire watermelon?
[3:16:25] americanmoses18: i got the drake armor from love dungeon first try ezpz
[3:16:27] TreeguyTV: got to 2700 in 3s on my rdruid last night
[3:16:30] llseattlell: we out here funneling babooshka all the golds
[3:16:44] xilyx2: @TreeguyTV thats actually impressive rn
[3:16:45] NightMunchies: Frost DK now everyones playing unholy  but frost has more damage
[3:16:48] GoldenA_: @nikthevoker i saw your lfg and i thought it sounds fun.
[3:16:52] ItsBees: Ven you need to get the rose tmogs
[3:16:57] PromiscuousToilet: @PsyqoSupreme what if you grew watermelons in small boxes so they stack. Cheaper shipping. More can be shipped. Profit EZ
[3:16:58] Nachofez: ven what era of wow pvp teams hasbeen the top one?
[3:17:09] xz6969: watermelon andies in chat
[3:17:13] nikthevoker: @GoldenA_ im told its dev meta comp on EU
[3:17:15] Somanie: Wizk cheated and Ven steals watermelons Madge
[3:17:18] pharmztko: we love 5 cent melons
[3:17:18] pr1smm: interesting question
[3:17:20] ItsBees: https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-rewards-from-love-is-in-the-air-2024-mount-toys-rose-transmog-337549
[3:17:25] OutlandishOW: i think people forgot what week 1 DH was like. it’s been nerfed 5 times
[3:17:30] Axtin: watermelon is a C tier fruit
[3:17:30] Vramii: the fact that they are out of season makes the shipping way cheaper.
[3:17:33] GetSmelly14: i know a watermelon guy
[3:17:36] jmt1616: You think any classes will get nerfs after awc?

[4:08:36] Eradivyn: hes insanely toxic
[4:08:36] SwiisH_Tv: No need to instigate thats how Crusader gets down
[4:08:42] Somanie: I meannnnnn crusader lost almost every game he played, so we'll take it with a grain of salt
[4:08:43] SwiisH_Tv: weird but its his thing
[4:08:46] seaent: cant deny the guy games

[4:09:34] nikthevoker: @StromicusRex SAME
[4:09:41] Shashka76: What I think happened is he used death on sam (mouseover macro) and the link nameplate showed up just as he hovered and pressed
[4:09:47] StromicusRex: i'm working on it, it's just slow lmao @Somanie
[4:10:04] NightMunchies: i dont think ven does PVE stuff but i could b Wrong
[4:10:08] lasmino: when i saw the wizk link kill my brain first went to macro, wouldnt be surprising if it was but who knows
[4:10:19] Badasti: unpopular opinion but I think the world needs characters like crusader... dude is batshit crazy but pretty funny sometimes
[4:10:22] StromicusRex: ven gets into pve for like. 2 weeks, then hates it
[4:10:27] Somanie: look bro if it works for you and you're doing okay, that isn't my business <3 @StromicusRex goal is to get off my anxiety meds really soon once I move so that'll be fun monkaS

[4:11:54] KralHor: Evoker = only healer that has to jump in the pile of DPS in order to heal just to get deleted 5 secs later
[4:11:55] Cocoapuffs1: a lot of people use mouseover macros to try and kill totems quickly too though
[4:12:22] Somanie: monkaEyes on your shit looking for the Spirit Link to come off cd from the opposition

[4:14:47] fraserdhm: thats what i do anyway
[4:14:49] Badasti: @Somanie nice, I was on all sorts for about 12 or so years. I think a lot of it is down to not trying too much to control your thoughts and letting things go - not easy to do
[4:14:50] StromicusRex: i do!
[4:15:08] fraserdhm: goooood! choccy or jelly's?

[4:16:25] valenti_No5: Saving pvp with ur content ofc
[4:16:27] Badasti: @Somanie mindfulness attempts to solve some of this, but as ridiculous as it sounds a large part of it is just choosing not to ruminate. It's like any other muscle, you practice 'choosing' not to think about stuff
[4:16:30] Slayer_Eagleone: i can..
[4:16:33] Somanie: I wanna make a whole batch of lit butter and just cook with it at some point
[4:16:34] Slayer_Eagleone: DH is broken atm

[4:16:37] lasmino: wizk should just be proud to have made a play thats making people doubt if its real or not
[4:16:37] Badasti: first step is to decide whether its something you can control and if it is, do you want to
[4:16:38] NightMunchies: dh u should play see if u can get wins
[4:16:44] DouzySham: @lasmino exactly

[4:26:40] NightMunchies: yup
[4:26:41] zynklu: Fade
[4:26:43] Badasti: the only thing that annoys me about that is it's the same icon as unfurling darkness, so I use SWP as a fallback icon for catharsis
[4:26:43] zynklu: yes
[4:27:00] zachgamegodx: at 100% the catharsis is full
[4:27:01] Slayer_Eagleone: im not trying to..
[4:27:03] Slayer_Eagleone: ok nvm
[4:27:22] Badasti: haha bro got insta shut down XD

[4:29:11] Applezbtw: can it get rogues out if u just shoot it out ?
[4:29:11] nsunique: eveeery single one
[4:29:20] Somanie: @Slayer_Eagleone we've talked about it a lot today bb -- Ven doesn't think Wizk cheated and we think the quick reaction time came from either a mouseover macro, or just an insane level of anticipation of that spell being cast (or both)
[4:29:32] goatedsp: Its time for Gnomobility DEATHWISH
[4:29:35] Locturnal_TV: i think he tailors his builds to whatever fiki comp hes quing
[4:29:38] Acurarx: I feel like if wizk said don’t use shadow and spam holy nova, people would take that as Bible
[4:29:41] SwiisH_Tv: lmao bro someone was complaining about subs getting ads in crusaders chat and he perma banned them. bro i am crying laughing dude is a menace
[4:29:54] NightMunchies: wth
[4:29:57] Somanie: there are plenty of addons and weakauras out there that show when a spell goes on cd, so as soon as Wiz saw that shit go on cd, after already waiting for it, that totem was toast
[4:29:57] DouzySham: @Somanie It's both and there should be a !WizK
[4:30:02] gaulois62: whats the fastest way to farm conquest^
[4:30:25] kreyzy8: KEKW
[4:30:26] NightMunchies: wth'

[4:30:49] Somanie: is not naturally, check him pc
[4:30:50] cruelhabbitts: stirring up drama
[4:30:51] willyg701: how did he cheat?
[4:30:59] sunsetjaxon: Blizzard said the fight against botting/cheating is an arms race
[4:31:01] Grimm303: how much is stored
[4:31:02] teamrocket_tm: What u guys think abt wizzk nipples?
[4:31:02] Scargon231: Is it just me, or does nunruki make you think monk instead of priest…
[4:31:04] kreyzy8: it just shows how big your catharsis is
[4:31:09] NightMunchies: exactly trolling u in your stream thats wrong
[4:31:11] DouzySham: How much your SWP will damage instantly
[4:31:11] zynklu: it shows accumulated dmg (thats % of your max hp)
[4:31:11] zlovett08: we need drama in the wow community. bring more people to retail arenas lmao
[4:31:14] Django_7: wizk made me wanna make an SP but im just gonna get trained 24/7 by dk and dh's and im no wizk so ima end up hating it
[4:31:15] SwiisH_Tv: @teamrocket_tm mid jelly got better
[4:31:20] Badasti: it tells you how much damage you have stored, and that will be applied to your next SWP as instant dam, it'sup to 12% of your hp
[4:31:22] Somanie: @Scargon231 venfuki is the monk tbf, and that's a 🔥 name too
[4:31:26] sunsetjaxon: !realm
[4:31:27] zachgamegodx: should show u the added dmg to ur next manual pain
[4:31:28] Peacetreaty4: catharsis tracker no?
[4:31:31] sunsetjaxon: !server
[4:31:33] Nightbot: Venruki plays retail on Tichondrius Horde, Faerlina Horde classic, and Crusader Strike Horde for SoD! POGGERS
[4:31:39] Scargon231: @somanie very fair
[4:31:41] zemm8582: use SWD on cd
[4:31:44] Badasti: your  main talent in this build is Psychic Link - you should play with that in mind I think
[4:31:46] levit8TNG: its Ticho home of psychos
[4:31:46] zemm8582: and stack a big sw pain
[4:31:47] kreyzy8: you spam death on CD basically and build stacks
[4:31:47] NightMunchies: u gotta use console
[4:31:55] NightMunchies: make it a tier set
[4:32:10] NightMunchies: thats how u get your 4 or 5
[4:32:11] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:32:11] zachgamegodx: u gotta get a weak aura for that dmg reduction when u flash heal talent
[4:32:11] willyg701: @camrencyber yes but its WoW you need a WA for everything lol

[4:34:18] xilyx2: % of max.. useless kinda
[4:34:35] Stoichulk: easier to read catharsis weak aura

[4:35:02] Saiyori: whose build did you grab there? I missed it
[4:35:23] frs_392: @Lemurion1 he reacted so fast with mouseover link kill
[4:35:26] xilyx2: 12 stack is for 4 set
[4:35:29] Somanie: is that the fyrakk mace??
[4:35:29] kreyzy8: the 4 set stacks to 12

[4:36:35] Somanie: @vortex071232 keeps up with cooldowns for you and other things like special abilities from gear set bonuses, tracks procs, whatever you want it to do tbh
[4:36:37] NightMunchies: says update Auras
[4:36:39] frs_392: @Lemurion1 he did it so fast the link didn't do anything to their hp
[4:36:39] xilyx2: you dont need both catharsis trackers you can just pick the one you like best then put the 4 set weak aura next to it
[4:36:50] ryanblue98: 20% vers on a shadow getting trained sounds fun
[4:36:50] vortex071232: @Somanie thanks!

[4:37:22] leibowitzr10: LOL
[4:37:22] conman_91: do you have the conquest to buy new trophies? sometimes easier to just craft new
[4:37:23] Badasti: shoudl I post it here?
[4:37:35] DKgrips: @Boruox recraft is personal only I think
[4:37:40] mvpala_tv: @Boruox you cant public recraft
[4:37:46] Boruox: oh right LOL
[4:37:47] Somanie: @vortex071232 ye!! most of the time the weakauras put all of those important little things into one big weakaura window for you that pops up in a place that's much easier to see and keep up with when you're actively doing something :)
[4:37:54] nsunique: wait wot
[4:37:55] sunsetjaxon: ok guys it's that time to show your craft skills lets go

[4:38:36] Somanie: @vortex071232 I bet there's a precog weakaura out there somewhere (I haven't gone to look for any, I PvE)
[4:38:47] Swingingwilly: makes no sense why am I 1850 resto shaman on tichondrius one of the hardest battle groups but on oceanic battle group I’m hard stuck 1600 resto shaman
[4:38:49] lilskeets: crafting is annoying this xpac, like good for the people that enjoy it but it's way to complex and hard to craft useful gear without a big time commitment
[4:38:50] vortex071232: Ohhh ok, thanks for the help though!
[4:38:52] Badasti: @venruki should I post the weakaura export in chat? It's quite long
[4:39:08] NightMunchies: depends how much u can craft
[4:39:25] Badasti: i created it myself, it aint on a site >.>
[4:39:26] serephidian: recraft? what?

[4:40:01] gastly_fan: recraft*
[4:40:16] sunsetjaxon: ohhh @gastly_fan i can't recraft either lol
[4:40:16] Somanie: @vortex071232 np!! most of the time if you Google "weakaura precog pvp" or "weakaura *whatever you need*" it'll give you a handful of options that you can compare :) website link you're for is wag.io and there are lists of weakauras on Wowhead guides for specs too
[4:40:33] SquidSosa: hella gold
[4:40:39] Aramith9: baller

[4:50:26] walkingsushi: walkingsushi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 33 month streak! Awesome work yesterday Ven!  Exciting

[4:51:01] Hark0n: should put torrent on cd instantly, best insanity
[4:51:14] fugginhiding: can you show that pres' healing breakdown after this?
[4:51:47] Divinized: now hes doing dmg
[4:51:50] Divinized: lets goooo
[4:52:50] Ultramagnus85: maybe the lock is just winning every match
[4:53:23] yesterday_potato: talomg tjhe spriest to deep damp. Wouldnt want to be that healer
[4:54:28] vortex071232: its amazing how much longer games last at this rating than my games at 1800
[4:54:34] cruelhabbitts: nice one
[4:54:49] quadriviumx: Yoooo i'm the hpal in the game, thought that was you
[4:54:54] Darnias: cancer winning
[4:55:02] drfeltgood: Have u seen more WW's today than before AWC?
[4:55:58] lolmangodx: what an accurate name he has
[4:56:03] Ultramagnus85: Locks the main character in this lobby
[4:56:50] shikari01: this makes me want to play pvp... *Sarcasm
[4:57:34] Hark0n: he's not playing extra dmg to torrent with all dots up so it doesnt rly do alot lel
[4:57:58] ogmonchhichi: do you guys think the only way at becoming good at solo shuffle healing is by keep playing even though I lose rating or should I try to watch more streamers/guides? 1800 cr
[4:58:21] Badasti: I noticed Wizk opens with a Void Torrent straight away - I he does it to get the haste stacks . The haste buff also lasts until its off cd and it gets kicked every time so I think it needs to be used on cd pmuch
[4:58:22] ryanblue98: @ogmonchhichi both
[4:58:26] KralHor: fear?
[4:58:37] joppisen: how come every streamer has so much in game gold?
[4:58:44] DoYouWannaHug: @ogmonchhichi Its both keep playing get the Experience, learn what people are dying to. Watch and learn for new builds and tips you dont know
[4:58:48] SquidSosa: tru asf
[4:58:49] KralHor: yeah
[4:58:51] Ultramagnus85: probably impossible to kill lock
[4:58:54] cruelhabbitts: very tough
[4:59:07] scallywagspecker: It's the worst esp when you get toxic whispers
[4:59:17] SquidSosa: you soulburn when u cant cast a bolt
[4:59:20] vortex071232: @camrencyber the soulburn applies bonus damage
[4:59:23] Finejeeeeez: LOL
[4:59:25] Ultramagnus85: rift dmg too stronk
[4:59:26] vortex071232: and its a filler
[4:59:46] vortex071232: you get bolts of when you know you can
[4:59:49] ogmonchhichi: I'm a bit afraid that if I continue queueing I may drop too far and not be able to climb back up. But guess that would mean I belong there
[5:00:03] vortex071232: you just need to use soul symbols in general
[5:00:20] zinisterzz: do people whisper alot after shuffle? im bad at pvp so I would have expected to get some but if they do but I havent gotten any lol
[5:00:31] KralHor: nice healin through that lava spam
[5:00:49] DouzySham: So does anyone know Wiz's secret? Like where is all that damage coming from? I tried spriest recently too with decent gear and couldnt do anything
[5:00:56] pragma90: @zinisterzz id say theres an average of 1 unhinged person per 5 shuffles
[5:01:06] Ultramagnus85: @zinisterzz its pretty common
[5:01:08] lilskeets: holy ele sham batman

[5:01:43] shikari01: no
[5:01:56] shikari01: They take your title away too. its pretty neat.
[5:02:16] Skydanzer: Was curious seeing as I can still see legion Elite sets on the vendor that require achievemtn from legion pvp

[5:05:23] vargath_: cast are quite long without the right amount of haste
[5:05:40] Badasti: I can sit and sustain 200k dps on 3 targets... I want to see what kinda deeps I can do if I can just sit there and mythics parse in arena
[5:05:42] zeref_qq: i swear to you i had the inner thought to play spriest but yeah i took into consideration

[5:18:20] lumpyo: US and Europe is about the same size
[5:18:23] ellisrainy: ppl in uk's concept of distance is so fried tho lol we think that driving for 5hrs is a long time KEKW
[5:18:24] slyphex: leeds is near nottinghamshirechester isn't it?

[5:25:08] xilyx2: mind spike trauma stacks are sorta like arcane momentum stacks.. worth watchin the buff

[5:26:18] heymomimonttv: @storebraad no lol
[5:26:29] Somanie: on Pika's stream yesterday, there were a couple games in which Wizk didn't use any interrupts KEKW I thought that was funny
[5:26:54] Hark0n: now u spiek swp le bit oneshot amaga KILLEM
[5:26:55] xilyx2: @Somanie sp doesnt have interrupt.. only silence
[5:27:23] Hizuru1: @xilyx2 guess what it does when you use it on someone casting
[5:27:25] Somanie: @xilyx2 would silence not interrupt a caster? (I'm genuinely asking)
[5:27:32] Hizuru1: @Somanie yes it would
[5:27:42] Borngood: that ele must be rich
[5:27:49] rynosaurwow: @Hizuru1 silence does not count as an interrupt
[5:27:53] commupriest: @Somanie yes, but 45s cooldown (30 talented)
[5:28:02] Divinized: ur not using ur s2 procs enough  its ok tho ur doing good for a first time
[5:28:03] DouzySham: @Borngood Hey! You planning on competing this season?
[5:28:06] Hizuru1: @rynosaurwow go argue gravity.

[5:28:30] SquidSosa: pain*
[5:28:31] Divinized: sorry p
[5:28:33] heymomimonttv: i think dk is a good example of having an interrupt and a silence.
[5:28:34] SquidSosa: :)
[5:28:36] Divinized: ty @SquidSosa
[5:28:37] Borngood: @DouzySham nah
[5:28:41] hoopscotch: hi bg
[5:28:49] rynosaurwow: @Hizuru1 A blanket silence on SP is not an interrupt. It does not show on details.
[5:28:57] Borngood: @hoopscotch greetings
[5:29:00] DouzySham: @Borngood dang, we missed you out there
[5:29:09] Somanie: @rynosaurwow if it can be used to interrupt something, I think that very much counts as an interrupt
[5:29:13] repsac1442: I am having so much trouble playing arcane mage man I am terrible.
[5:29:38] rynosaurwow: @Somanie It's a blanket silence. I'm saying it doesn't count as an interrupt on details. That's why it wouldn't show up.
[5:29:39] Somanie: just because it also silences doesn't mean it doesn't interrupt (like most other interrupts besides Solar Beam because you can just move out of it w/o any lingering silence)
[5:29:45] Somanie: OHHH I gotchu
[5:29:57] Somanie: that's so fucking weird then KEKW
[5:31:04] rynosaurwow: @Somanie Unlike beam, priest silence doesn't lock you out of your casting school. Beam is one of those abilities that can be used as both a blanket silence and a kick :)
[5:31:09] xGriefxGodx: Ven here practicing instant deathing spirit link?

[5:34:48] mvpala_tv: tell me if you agree or disagree ven: the idea of sp seems fun but in all reality its a nightmare when you play one
[5:35:02] nikthevoker: you can mindgames his renewing blaze for extra dam LUL
[5:35:04] endo474: all I play is sp and it makes me tingly
[5:35:07] Grimm303: EZ
[5:35:26] boundric: that SP carried that match
[5:35:26] dadfreddie: rather play super aggro disc :D
[5:38:56] DouzySham: much nicer damage, you're already getting good. that was fast
[5:38:57] boundric: a cool +1 cr
[5:38:58] nikthevoker: hdev/sp not greatest comp :(

[5:39:35] Finejeeeeez: cant stop wont stop!
[5:39:44] endo474: sp is super weird but I can say once you get used to it you start pumping
[5:39:46] fistweaveurnan: Think youd find kieteds builds a bit simpler and just as effective especially into meele
[5:39:51] nikthevoker: mind games evoker renewing blaze, BIG DAM
[5:39:51] GreanzyW: download a bot
[5:39:52] kreyzy8: press death more often
[5:39:54] legiontheworgen: out of curiosity, what's your Dark Evangelism uptime?
[5:39:57] fairchildx: @venruki have wiz coach you ;)
[5:39:57] imjudgy: we need wizk in here
[5:40:01] endo474: use shadowword pain after u get 12 stacks from shadow death
[5:40:03] kreyzy8: it gives a lot of insanity for DPs
[5:40:06] endo474: u hit 100k+
[5:40:08] DouzySham: more death, more swp
[5:40:10] Neurotoxal: juke kicks
[5:40:12] Unmercy__: honestly the biggest thing is your haste imo
[5:40:13] marcoalvapaka: More hardcore music
[5:40:22] Jamzy: flash of light more for the 10% passive damage reduction
[5:40:24] whiffymink: replace the person sitting in your chair with wizk is one way to improve @venruki
[5:40:24] Santu110: hey venwookie how do you feel about pikaboo and his rogue micromanagement of the ewoks?

[5:41:36] Unmercy__: dot management is pretty big too
[5:41:51] fistweaveurnan: @DouzySham Wiz plays with an outlaw rogue.
[5:41:53] Zlipps: wizk has a rogue with him, it gives him the freedom to cast
[5:41:59] sind233: @fistweaveurnan to be fair Void form is the build for shuffle
[5:42:00] yo_shame: @fistweaveurnan i feel like crash is a must into double melee
[5:42:13] DouzySham: @fistweaveurnan good point
[5:42:16] fistweaveurnan: @yo_shame It definitely can make your life easier with your the KT
[5:42:26] fistweaveurnan: when*

[5:44:07] Blitzylive: to the BGs for training

[5:45:01] lebrun_james_: lotta enemies in that arena
[5:45:02] Yanari_x: those pet classes man
[5:45:05] Yanari_x: it's wild
[5:45:18] Dwilk20: @sind233 ya the Hood is for pet classes only but its nuts having 50+% haste on your shadow crash use against pet classes
[5:46:30] ColorfulGhost: !bag

[5:47:38] heymomimonttv: @gastly_fan agreed, one of my fave classes aesthetically
[5:47:47] raddx27: twitch is not what it used to be. open stream and get hit with a 3 min ad is crazyt

[6:01:42] hiddensquid13: always looking at my cd's
[6:01:47] FinkleTheMage: That's JokerD strats man, don't do that >< @Ziqoftw
[6:01:57] whiffymink: can you export your omnibar profile? I just clicked all my spells on omnibar and then the game crashed and it all went away @venruki
[6:02:02] Roxxybolts: the nunnnnn
[6:02:12] Dwilk20: Kubzy makes Arcane look like its a hacking spec lol
[6:02:12] Hark0n: wizk has pikaboo to stun everything thats why it looks easy
[6:02:18] sind233: 5head
[6:02:21] Badasti: warrior players watch mage stream 'look at this dumb easy class omg'
[6:02:48] dave_seer: I feel sp is imo is a bit harder. Like you said you can't really move most of the time. Idk maybe I'm wrong in my thinking.
[6:02:48] zeref_qq: @Ziqoftw fav mage
[6:02:48] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The Best Specs The Pros Are Playing In PvP Right Now" view it here: youtu.be/-WB0Pe8nKKo
[6:02:53] boltqt_: I've never heard anyone complain about any arcane mage as much as they complain about Kubzy
[6:03:01] ImJordanHi: Kubzy uses arcanosphere as a defensive LUL
[6:03:07] Iceflows84: Eiz died in the awc and still had dispersion. Just saying. Even the best make mistakes.
[6:03:08] Roxxybolts: how about that ww sub winning
[6:03:10] wzrdtrx_tv: venk coming in hot
[6:03:15] Iceflows84: Wiz*
[6:04:14] dave_seer: True
[6:04:18] Hizuru1: Imagine levelling requiring any thought process where you actually had to use abilities might have learned something KEKW
[6:04:24] Badasti: I think half the time people die to not using dispersion or block or something is down to the GCD. I think it was a mistake for Blizzard to make it so long a few patches ago
[6:04:26] agren13: @Roxxybolts Highlight of the whole tourney!
[6:04:30] Badasti: not patches expansions
[6:04:32] chancywilson: what would be ur sales pitch to play SP? i always thought affa looked like more fun, is it?
[6:04:33] Stoichulk: Can you buy the Hellbloom staff???
[6:04:52] trezzdisc: 19 conquest tokens just open them
[6:05:03] sind233: @Badasti why are some of these defensives even on GCD while the others are not, thats pepega imo
[6:05:05] Badasti: blizz logic "slow down the gcd we want players to think" - meanwhile getting killed from like 80-100% to 0 in less than a second
[6:05:10] dave_seer: KEKW
[6:05:14] ImJordanHi: Have you seen a mage besides Kubzy use Arcanosphere as a defensive? LUL
[6:05:18] Hizuru1: @Badasti react movement, defensive abilities should not be on gcd.
[6:07:21] Iceflows84: Peace love and chicken grease. You all have a great day. Back to work I go.
[6:07:37] maxremy9: what is that wa?
[6:07:52] CQ_Miya: What is the thing scrolling icons on the lower left?

[6:08:34] Beastitude: you should cast it
[6:08:35] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: ofc

[6:12:17] Kineticlol: The ilvl required for solo shuffle. Is it the base ilvl or does it take into account pvp ilvl increases
[6:12:19] zachgamegodx: the marv from home alone analogy someone gave was perfect for when u dont shower the mop
[6:12:19] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: hes crazy

[6:13:36] FinkleTheMage: I remember when Ven used to have long hair, you can legit pull off any hair Ven :)
[6:13:40] Boruox: he says easy!
[6:13:47] FinkleTheMage: Studly Canadian you
[6:13:51] fatlittlepaypig: i guess 3k
[6:13:54] fistweaveurnan: @FinkleTheMage Sus
[6:13:56] fatlittlepaypig: in total
[6:14:08] gastly_fan: wow easy money
[6:14:20] laalaaland22: someone in chat sure knows what theyre talking about
[6:14:21] FinkleTheMage: @fistweaveurnan Wait what's sus about me being genuine? :(
[6:14:24] Dirkdigglier: You guys think the casters make more than the winners?
[6:14:25] bransby09: Were you suprised Kalvish lost to Pika
[6:14:28] hiddensquid13: i heard the casters got like $250k a day
[6:14:30] Locturnal_TV: dang thats almost as much as the competitors are making
[6:14:45] malvarcla: I thought the casters got paid like 2 mil an hour of casting?
[6:14:59] bransby09: Psfiend just gets 1 shot
[6:15:00] fistweaveurnan: I play it , phase shift is oprtional
[6:15:02] hiddensquid13: @malvarcla broooo i heard 2M a second!
[6:15:05] Shakertime: do people just kill it too fast?
[6:15:08] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: i dont like it
[6:15:09] YoMamaSoFine69: was fun when you could shield it and make it imortal
[6:15:10] Dirkdigglier: They should bring back OG psyfiend and make it cast fear
[6:15:15] dave_seer: yeah i miss using psy
[6:15:28] Unmercy__: @Dirkdigglier YES
[6:15:32] Finejeeeeez: snutz play anymore?
[6:15:37] Intravz: og psfiend was so funny
[6:15:38] malvarcla: should give priest a psyfiend like demonic tyrant and make it unkillable
[6:15:39] Unmercy__: and shadow walk or w/e it was called
[6:15:40] YoMamaSoFine69: 2.7
[6:15:43] fatlittlepaypig: 2.4
[6:15:43] Cvarks: u see we gettin our hero talent’s Wednesday
[6:15:45] gastly_fan: love that girly pop set
[6:15:46] dave_seer: hmm
[6:15:47] hataroxz: 2400
[6:15:48] Zorek64: 2.2
[6:15:48] klikka: rank 1
[6:15:54] FinkleTheMage: Top Wizk or it's not worth it Kappa
[6:15:54] Badasti: to not lose your mind being trained 24/7
[6:15:55] Intravz: god i miss spectral guise
[6:15:55] Hark0n: rank 1
[6:16:04] orcrimmar: 2083 seems like a good goal
[6:16:06] FreddoB: 1200
[6:16:13] Badasti: or actually I think losing your mind is a requirement to play it well
[6:16:32] laalaaland22: PartyParrot
[6:17:18] laalaaland22: were they selling any pink weapons in trader post
[6:17:25] boundric: play the legion weapon so it'll talk to you
[6:17:39] Badasti: i have almost every class at max level now, just my dk and the flying rat to go
[6:18:03] Locturnal_TV: idk prob not
[6:18:07] Badasti: @camrencyber ret paladin
[6:18:44] freakaccidentt: how hard would the gear grind be for pvp if i havent played in a year or so?
[6:18:47] Badasti: haha, found the ret
[6:18:49] Dirkdigglier: Casters all get trained the trick is to play with another caster who is easier to train than you are
[6:19:02] EndlessPillows: Which spec surprised you the most this season to play, in a good way?
[6:19:11] Hizuru1: pvp enchant should give your abilities cosmetic update with that color  as flare on them sinec casters dont use weapons
[6:19:19] Badasti: idk to give you a better answer all casters get trained, but good mages might get left alone
[6:19:19] fistweaveurnan: I prefer destro/sp
[6:19:20] Saiyori: affli is real fun to play with
[6:19:21] gdodmebxu: demo
[6:19:22] malvarcla: demo
[6:19:26] bransby09: Aff <3
[6:19:39] malvarcla: demo is insane with any caster tbh
[6:19:40] FreddoB: I might suck at arena but I made a killer riff this weekend
[6:19:46] Badasti: but as a mage theyll usually test you first, unless you are fire, then theyll just go you all game anyway
[6:19:51] dooshken: seems like spriest and aff try to do the same thing
[6:19:55] gastly_fan: prolly demo
[6:20:37] SkiaTheShade: haven't played in a bit, are queues still atrocious?
[6:20:40] dakila24: i swear the 2300 bracket is filled with some very fishy chinese players lol
[6:20:44] Badasti: yeah whether you get left alone or not is determined in the first round pmuch
[6:20:47] Hark0n: unless you're SP then that doesn't apply
[6:20:49] Badasti: just gotta kite like a god once XD
[6:20:51] orcrimmar: did you decide if you're going to grow out your hair or cut it?
[6:20:56] Kolowavex: whatup dude
[6:21:02] srslysnek: cant tell you the number of times i would have died if the enemy team stayed on me for 2 more seconds before giving up
[6:21:08] Kolowavex: any qs?
[6:21:11] fistweaveurnan: @dakila24 Odd im there and have never seen that
[6:21:21] Badasti: wait
[6:21:22] Badasti: what was that
[6:21:32] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: yeah
[6:21:32] gastly_fan: e boy tier list?
[6:21:32] Badasti: it aroused my curiosity then disappeared LUL
[6:21:36] Ultramagnus85: eboy tierlist?
[6:21:38] Hizuru1: you talk shit on someone be ready to be shit on
[6:21:43] Hizuru1: americans are thin skinned losers
[6:21:45] Badasti: streamer rankings or something?
[6:21:51] Kolowavex: glink made the list
[6:21:57] Badasti: i dont even know who those people are
[6:21:57] dooshken: FeelsBadMan Rip Reck
[6:22:01] orcrimmar: Who are those people? I only know reckful from there
[6:22:04] Judgejobrown: what am i even looking at
[6:22:07] Bonegraft: this guy has been talking shit for like 2 hours lol
[6:22:11] dave_seer: LUL
[6:22:12] Hizuru1: noodle prime example of X shills wow andys LUL
[6:22:16] fistweaveurnan: @Hizuru1 Think infernions daily crying on twitter proves EU are thin skinned losers
[6:22:17] Judgejobrown: am i just too old to know who any of those poepl are?
[6:22:23] Badasti: doxxed over a tier list... wtf
[6:22:24] fatlittlepaypig: people got doxxed over a tier list?
[6:22:26] fatlittlepaypig: LOL
[6:22:27] fatlittlepaypig: wtf
[6:22:35] rockwellhb: Not sure I'd call Americans thin skinned.  There's a lot of KFC lining that skin
[6:22:37] dooshken: Some people are very fragile
[6:22:43] gastly_fan: I for one am both thin skinned and a loser, so
[6:22:48] Bigvuqoffdam: Bigvuqoffdam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[6:22:57] Bigvuqoffdam: HAPPY MONDAY
[6:22:59] wackpoetic: Sengmin rukiLove
[6:23:00] dilsnick: is it just me, or was this past weekend one of the best AWC's in a long long time?
[6:23:00] Hizuru1: @fistweaveurnan no clue who is that most pvp andys cry
[6:23:01] ozzyp95: whats that ability on ur C-3?
[6:23:16] Kolowavex: i remember when ven said hi to me FeelsBadMan
[6:23:18] emu71989: because echo got smashed
[6:23:18] Roxxybolts: NA AWC was awful
[6:23:19] PhDickens: fresh blood is refreshing
[6:23:21] unsccessful: the upsets, the gameplay
[6:23:24] finnybae: the DRAMA
[6:23:27] dilsnick: fresh blood and close games
[6:23:29] dave_seer: sp won
[6:23:32] dave_seer: :)
[6:23:32] Locturnal_TV: i really enjoyed watching rogues finally make it to the finals
[6:23:32] Roxxybolts: I loved EU with the diversity but outlaws just ruin the game
[6:23:34] Badasti: same reason as you, as much as I hate melee cleaves I liked to see teams playing offmeta comps and doing well
[6:23:34] dooshken: I loved the EU games, seeing Echo get dethroned
[6:23:38] therealawake_22: Echo lost
[6:23:40] fatlittlepaypig: thoughts on wizk sniping that link totem in < 1 second? Kappa
[6:23:41] gastly_fan: lots of like back and forth series - at the edge of my seat the whole time
[6:23:43] baxter5569: new teams, echo lost,  not everything was just rogue even though they won..... again @venruki
[6:23:44] Badasti: I was also super happy to see TM win
[6:23:44] jporter_: just boring that rogue is in every comp
[6:23:47] Zerksyera: aweful ???? ok super casual
[6:23:47] Afani89: A lot of comp variation and surprises
[6:23:49] fistweaveurnan: NA awc was great the games between voidgg/tm and tm/liquid were so close it was exciting
[6:23:49] Roxxybolts: every game 50% damp
[6:23:55] unsccessful: ruins the game = high level skillcap
[6:23:57] codyallyn: my fav part was watching whazz's team upset.   its nice to see new people
[6:24:10] flames222: EU ran stale with echo winning every awc. Ironically, echo losing is good for the awc at this point.
[6:24:10] Hizuru1: @unsccessful cope harder
[6:24:11] dave_seer: YEP
[6:24:13] Shakertime: sadly
[6:24:20] dooshken: Everyone knows Rogue is disgusting tho
[6:24:21] Zerksyera: bring back OP hunters
[6:24:27] Hizuru1: everyone who ared quit :P since no point
[6:24:30] Badasti: pretty much, we've accepted the rogues and we're judging the sidekick classes LUL
[6:24:30] Hizuru1: *cared
[6:24:33] Hark0n: i'm pretty sure everyone knows rogues are busted a f
[6:24:37] dave_seer: that is very true
[6:24:39] fistweaveurnan: They have the best kit and it requires the most skill to use, I can rest my sack on outlaws at 2.4
[6:24:52] slaughthemage: people always hate on rogue :s
[6:24:53] gastly_fan: @hizuru1 what are you even on about bruh
[6:24:54] sgtstarfox: Only reason people hated on the NA awc is because they know how SCrewed EU is
[6:25:07] phanabananana: its the exact same as when every comp needed a ret.. but nobody wants to talk about that
[6:25:07] dyenamikz: I think the solution to all our problems is buffing affy dmg by a solid 50%
[6:25:08] finnybae: every team played really well, the games def went longer but the gameplay seemed really crisp
[6:25:12] dooshken: @slaughthemage Rogue is an OP class. It's not hate. It's the truth
[6:25:15] Badasti: people criticise rogues is a mroe correct statement... and its valid criticism
[6:25:18] Shakertime: the problem is the floor has been lowered for rogues, and the ceiling is still just as high
[6:25:27] Blakeasuarus: as a rogue main i promise rogues are OP
[6:25:40] callexy95: o.0
[6:25:45] Blakeasuarus: arent* eff. messed up my joke
[6:25:46] fatlittlepaypig: yea it's bad design
[6:25:56] grimzero617: Wait, nelf extends the stealth window?!
[6:25:56] slaughthemage: Rogues are strong yes, and its fine, other classes are strong too, rogues just scale good with burst classes
[6:26:01] EndlessPillows: Might be a problem with the racial more than the class
[6:26:02] Hizuru1: devs dont play the game so
[6:26:03] Judgejobrown: Trill coming with the dissertations lol
[6:26:05] aut0p1lot: what did you think of LAVA LAVA?
[6:26:05] fatlittlepaypig: CDR is legit never good
[6:26:06] Hark0n: honestly surprised cheapshot has no CD at this point
[6:26:12] Badasti: @Blakeasuarus rogues are so outrageously busted that you cant even land the punchline LUL
[6:26:15] dooshken: @slaughthemage Rogues don't scale "good". They scale INSANELY
[6:26:16] Judgejobrown: man is galactic brain
[6:26:18] zachgamegodx: @Judgejobrown ikr, that sounded like a legal document
[6:26:18] Dirkdigglier: the outlaw slow is so oppressive. Them being good frustrating but also playing at RP walk speed with the rogue grapple and stepping everywhere is lame
[6:26:21] dave_seer: KEKW
[6:26:30] Judgejobrown: @Judgejobrown KEKW
[6:26:34] Blakeasuarus: @Badasti lol true
[6:26:41] FadeXbp: Its been always like dat, warlocks 1 shotting everyone, and #1 on ladder and winning every tournaments but "Omg DH op, omg warrior op"
[6:26:43] Thee_Hopper: levitate
[6:26:47] dooshken: @camrencyber And we saw one win
[6:26:48] sgtstarfox: yea i think people are exaggerating them a lot
[6:26:52] Shakertime: think we found the rogue player KEKW
[6:26:57] dave_seer: denial is real
[6:26:58] Hark0n: yeah rogues die when ANOTHER ROGUE goes on them Kappa
[6:26:59] dave_seer: LUL
[6:27:06] ZEXbbot: @Shakertime thats more of a mage habit. block the fall
[6:27:07] Ronsimus: the amount of delusional ppl
[6:27:12] Hizuru1: shills mad
[6:27:15] dooshken: EU and NA champ had a rogue
[6:27:19] ZEXbbot: or wait, did you mean somoene else
[6:27:20] dooshken: Yall are smoking only haha
[6:27:30] sind233: I have no respect for people who have DH as their mains
[6:27:35] sind233: Yall a joke
[6:27:36] fistweaveurnan: I think its fair to say CDR needs to be nerfed.
[6:27:36] Badasti: you could watch Rogues Thanos click the other arena classes out of existence and people will be like "bro you dont understand, rogues aren't that crazy"
[6:27:37] SkiaTheShade: i shall rogue whether it's good or not, i shall rogue
[6:27:38] sind233: No cpa
[6:27:40] sind233: cap
[6:27:41] Yanari_x: Rogue mains are just scared
[6:27:41] Judgejobrown: Q POP TIME TO WIN BABY
[6:27:42] dyenamikz: Rogues shouldnt have the tool kits they have along with the damage and survival that they do.
[6:27:45] emu71989: well the avg rogue player isnt anywhere close to whazz or pikaboo or the other na rogue I forget his name
[6:27:52] grimzero617: Rogues are the main character of wow pvp
[6:27:55] sotirios2000: Rogue players are just better skilled Kappa
[6:28:06] Hizuru1: chat is cooked
[6:28:06] FadeXbp: People crying about X class being OP meanwhile literally they're playing the #1 most OP class during the season bunch of clowns
[6:28:06] fatlittlepaypig: and bots are doing it Pog
[6:28:10] emu71989: all great players
[6:28:11] Hizuru1: flatearthers in chat full on
[6:28:12] emu71989: not avg players
[6:28:14] slaughthemage: I see rogue more as a support / carrier for some classes ; yes they are strong into some classes
[6:28:18] joyrex_j9: dont forget howton the goat
[6:28:21] EndlessPillows: I'm not doing it :(
[6:28:22] dooshken: I'd be fine with rogue getting nerfed into the floor for an expansion so we can have a shakeup in the tourneys
[6:28:34] orcrimmar: even venruki can do it
[6:28:34] aaggros: outlaw doesnt have the same dps profile that other classes do, but they are still insane
[6:28:35] aut0p1lot: you can say the same thing about other classes as well
[6:28:41] zachgamegodx: learning curve on rogue is pretty big, i think rogues are in a solid spot atm. Demon hunters seems more overpowered to me
[6:28:41] paperbasketthomas: so play rogue...
[6:28:42] fatlittlepaypig: rogues are cool when dance doesnt have a 75% uptime
[6:28:48] Judgejobrown: new challenge idea. 1800 challenge as blood DK with camera zoomed allthe way in. first person view only
[6:28:49] ayalcoh1: how come we didnt see any demo, demo pretty tough in long games
[6:28:49] emu71989: no you dont!  you love wizards how dare you disgrace the mage
[6:28:49] sind233: Just let them die man @venruki
[6:28:53] Ractz: yoooo
[6:28:54] Ronsimus: makle an own game for rogues and resto druid, let them play eachother, best fix
[6:29:00] dooshken: hahaha
[6:29:04] 7osei: Rogues used to be bad against melee cleaves, so maybe nerf their defensives against melee
[6:29:05] sind233: They feel unkillable
[6:29:06] fatlittlepaypig: wotlk rogue was the sweet spot imo
[6:29:14] yowler_: players like pika and whaaz etc are unquestionably some of the best players in the world, but there are players who main other classes also at that level and can't make their class perform like rogues
[6:29:19] joyrex_j9: in general CDR mechanics have been busted when they're added
[6:29:27] fatlittlepaypig: @camrencyber dance literally has a talent that reduces cd based on combo pts spent
[6:29:28] ZEXbbot: @fatlittlepaypig weirdly i agree
[6:29:31] Ultramagnus85: I rarely ever run into rogues in ss
[6:29:32] emu71989: youre a mage god and I will tolerate NO wizard disrespect from you
[6:29:40] Hobblefoot: I leave the stream for 2 hours and people still all up in rogue's grill.  Sigh.  I swear I have played Outlaw in PVP since the end of BFA and have seen them good twice.  Now and in Shadowlands for one season.  Geez.
[6:29:42] Badasti: I just want one AWC where rogues arent a default pick for every team... I want to see somene running a walking dead, some team running mage warrior, some team running jungle etc... if we're just watchign rogue + sidekick it gets kinda boring
[6:29:59] fatlittlepaypig: wotlk rogue was the perfect mix of offensive and defensive utility. and it actually ran out eventually
[6:30:00] grimzero617: Do you think the armor rating changes have any impact on comps?
[6:30:00] Hobblefoot: @Badasti I can get behind that.
[6:30:04] aaggros: lol only seen them good twice?
[6:30:07] fatlittlepaypig: @camrencyber outlaw is a gimmick
[6:30:08] sind233: Ven looking at some naked ladies on his left
[6:30:18] aaggros: You must mean all of shadowlands and ...
[6:30:20] dooshken: @Hobblefoot Outlaw has been good for all of Dragonflight
[6:30:29] Hizuru1: dont watch it and they might change game chat they dont care for any feedback which does not take money from them.
[6:30:47] callexy95: devoker :3
[6:30:48] flames222: playing against rogues feels terrible. You literally get punished the most vs rogues for using your trinket, you may or may not live their burst even after pre walling their goes, that feels like bad design. No other class can literally throw people in timeout as long as they can.
[6:30:52] emu71989: lets get back to DK's real talk
[6:30:59] aaggros: Where were all the ret/war or ret/hunt teams
[6:31:02] Hobblefoot: @dooshken No. It has not. And certainly not "OP" ....
[6:31:04] fatlittlepaypig: MISSED THE KICK, GOUGING
[6:31:08] Hobblefoot: @venruki Agree again.
[6:31:09] zachgamegodx: outlaw retained gouge for awhile
[6:31:13] zachgamegodx: i dont think they ever lost it
[6:31:18] Pradathelord: outlaw didnt lose it but sub and assa did
[6:31:19] zachgamegodx: other specs picked it up recently
[6:31:22] Dirkdigglier: Seems like they wanted to replace blind sap with gouge
[6:31:24] fonandelino: doing first SS after around 5 month break, did not know fistweaver is a thing, sad
[6:31:28] dooshken: @Hobblefoot Man you are living on the copium
[6:31:39] Roxxybolts: I don't know I enjoy watching the move and echo but god outlaw is sooooo boring
[6:31:51] fatlittlepaypig: i quit wow ~ 2 months ago but it still hurts to see balance this bad
[6:31:58] baxter5569: i have hated rogues since vanilla :( wish anything else could win but they have so much utility that they even were the counter for aug
[6:31:59] Dirkdigglier: @ venruki Your keybind for levitate is a-5
[6:32:02] sind233: Im not happy
[6:32:04] slaughthemage: I would still like to see some stuns reduced or removed from rogue; for mages to have like Deep freeze to open up more comps
[6:32:06] sind233: Where do I sign ven
[6:32:07] fatlittlepaypig: balance on a competitive level is what i mean
[6:32:10] Hobblefoot: @dooshken That is very much out of character for me. I don't have horse in the race. My favorite spec is Survival.  I am just making rational observations.
[6:32:22] fatlittlepaypig: yea but there's 2 outliers like every season
[6:32:33] finnybae: based take, rogue brings too much value in CC for any other melee aside from having op damage to be viable
[6:32:38] Zerksyera: hunter doesnt get played much at all , sadge
[6:32:38] Mhortai: Did you see OTKs two announcements Mr @venruki ?
[6:32:39] baxter5569: @venruki but rogues are the biggest cry babies behind rets :( blizzard couldnt handle the QQ
[6:32:40] aaggros: Everyone who pays and plays wow has a horse in this...
[6:32:48] slaughthemage: I would still like to see some stuns reduced or removed from rogue; for mages to have like Deep freeze to open up more comps
[6:32:48] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[6:32:54] figurines: @baxter5569 some specs aren't as fun to face as others. rogue is consistently this spec. sometimes mage as melee. sometimes destro/warlock as anything
[6:32:58] finnybae: and even then you can shut down the other viable melees with.... rogue ccs
[6:33:01] dave_seer: yeah
[6:33:05] finnybae: true
[6:33:05] aaggros: I agree
[6:33:11] Hobblefoot: @venruki I love you but I have to say that you get some serious fixations on specs from time to time.  ....   I agree about that last statement about rogues.
[6:33:11] unsccessful: i said that and someone in chat said "cope harder" KEKW
[6:33:12] PsyqoSupreme: agreed. super high skill cap
[6:33:18] Badasti: i think thats true for sub and outlaw... ass is pretty easy
[6:33:30] Badasti: S1 assassination was awful at every level
[6:33:33] flames222: unfortunately we face the best players 1600-2100 via viewer games lol
[6:33:49] sind233: Ven found his levitate PogChamp
[6:33:59] fatlittlepaypig: like when RM was 100% of the awc matches
[6:34:01] fatlittlepaypig: it's always rogue
[6:34:10] fatlittlepaypig: idk how blizzard doesnt wake up
[6:34:21] finnybae: it was so hype when liquid played dh/dk as a do or die comp though that was sick
[6:34:26] dooshken: Gouge is like row 1 talent right?
[6:34:42] jamesip87: teams should vote for one dps one heal to not be in the tournament
[6:35:01] phanabananana: the only thing that can balance rogues being overpowered is hpal and rets reining supreme!!!! buff ret!!
[6:35:02] fatlittlepaypig: we go from sepsis 1 shots in shadowlands, to AWC being all RM, to outlaw running everything
[6:35:02] Hobblefoot: I guess it is the fact I can't see what you all can see when I sit and watch the AWC and streamers. Outlaw does not look that oppressive.  But I am a casual. Most of the time people like me don't factor in to PVP discussions.
[6:35:04] zachgamegodx: ven that wasnt nice to laugh at my opinon on outlaw, i dont laugh at ur takes
[6:35:05] aaggros: It would be like have scatter not dr trap and giving hunters monkey stun back and nothing drs
[6:35:05] figurines: @camrencyber yes its not clear why the other rogue specs get so much defensives for so long and assa isn't buffed
[6:35:07] Badasti: hell yeah, that'd make the game so much better
[6:35:19] Hizuru1: chat decides picks and bans makes EZ
[6:35:23] fatlittlepaypig: wym u cant see it look at the rosters
[6:35:26] fatlittlepaypig: outlaw on every team
[6:35:26] dooshken: Pick and ban would be sick. People would have to multi class. Make skill higher overall
[6:35:35] finnybae: would there ever be a situation where you wouldnt ban rogue or the best healer at the time if bans were a thing?
[6:35:36] purepazaak3: its a problem with the stealth archetype. They end up OP in every game
[6:35:47] zachgamegodx: well, it's not true what you're saying
[6:35:48] Hobblefoot: They did not win every time. They were beat back to back in EU
[6:35:49] Hizuru1: damm people arguing gravity level of nonsense
[6:35:49] figurines: @venruki what about instead of spec bans you could only play each spec once a match? Bad idea?
[6:35:53] zachgamegodx: EU had no outlaw rogues in their finals
[6:35:53] Hizuru1: some of you are cooked
[6:36:09] fatlittlepaypig: KEKW
[6:36:14] dooshken: Still a rogue bro haha
[6:36:19] ImVigdis: that also means it has a 50% loss rate, so its perfectly balanced!
[6:36:21] uhdaptiv: some people dont remember what arena tournaments looked like before addons KEKW
[6:36:22] dyenamikz: a rogue is a rogue
[6:36:27] xEscher: how difficult is the spec anyway
[6:36:27] Pradathelord: @ImVigdis big true
[6:36:38] finnybae: awc was really good though, very entertaining
[6:36:41] zachgamegodx: then why are we specifying specs i don't get it? are assassination rogues borken?
[6:36:44] fatlittlepaypig: rogue balance went out the window after mop
[6:36:45] finnybae: great casting great gameplay
[6:36:50] aaggros: EU feels like an anomaly though, doesnt it?
[6:36:51] dyenamikz: all 3 specs when good are volatile and disrespectful
[6:37:11] Hobblefoot: And I am not trolling I swear. I am just trying to have a fun thoughtful debate. Outlaw in the hands of the best rogue in the world lost back to back games.
[6:37:16] Badasti: I also want to see my man Jelly get some game time
[6:37:17] uhdaptiv: we also saw, dh, dk, ww, sub, outlaw, warr
[6:37:21] fatlittlepaypig: with all the layoffs i doubt it's gonna get fixed by end of expac
[6:37:25] fatlittlepaypig: ppl are concerned with other shit
[6:37:25] Lamatastisch: I would love to see mes more on DK but I feel like swapping him in is just a bad pick, because they lmiss out on outlaw Sadge
[6:37:26] dyenamikz: They didnt play affiction locks sadly
[6:37:28] figurines: I just think it's bad for the Esport product to have the same players playing the same specs for an entire match vs the same team
[6:37:35] sind233: I wouldnt call a one god playing SP as SP being played
[6:37:36] kalibus1: Venruki mage question, does time stop (from evoker) stop damage from Ray of frost after it has started
[6:37:50] Hobblefoot: Side note: I still want all rogues nerfed a bit. I am just saying.
[6:37:52] dilsnick: my favorite part was and hpriest winning
[6:37:56] phanabananana: the only thing that can balance rogues being overpowered is hpal and rets reining supreme!!!! buff ret!!
[6:37:57] dave_seer: LUL
[6:38:03] Strussedout: damn no hunters =/
[6:38:09] Dirkdigglier: Frost mage melee?
[6:38:11] fatlittlepaypig: u ever balance your game around 10% of the specs
[6:38:11] Hizuru1: ANyone denying reality is cooked
[6:38:12] fatlittlepaypig: Sadge
[6:38:14] dooshken: Rogue not OP COPIUM
[6:38:14] Dwilk20: I only saw Wizk on Spriest is that Tourny?
[6:38:17] zachgamegodx: prolly means fdk
[6:38:18] Dirkdigglier: Ahh
[6:38:20] flames222: sooo...nerf dk? lol
[6:38:24] SkiaTheShade: i like sub rogue meta's and i don't like outlaw meta's
[6:38:24] slaughthemage: META is meta :/ no matter what it is ; these are the cards when the stakes are high
[6:38:27] slaughthemage: its sad
[6:38:34] bit0x: can u show healers pls
[6:38:34] fonandelino: for years every time I toon in for AWC 90% are rogue teams
[6:38:36] dyenamikz: no hunters or affy locks?!? They need buffs!
[6:38:39] hataroxz: sad no hunter
[6:38:47] fatlittlepaypig: imo the game balance went out the window when it was easy to have a million alts
[6:38:49] fatlittlepaypig: and just play fotm
[6:38:50] Badasti: wait but there was an ele
[6:38:51] uhdaptiv: healer representation was better than most awc events too imo
[6:38:52] xR0dsZ: nice playlist
[6:38:57] Badasti: im sure there was at least 1 ele gmae
[6:38:58] MaximumnNeo: interesting that SP and Boomkin were most playted, but only one team played each in the finals.
[6:38:58] lilskeets: kinda surprised so much r sham
[6:38:58] Dirkdigglier: I wonder what people would play if they all got paid to play instead of win
[6:38:59] bransby09: Didnt Cdew play pres
[6:39:00] sind233: show EU LUL
[6:39:18] bit0x: did not expect rshammy at 1st place
[6:39:19] fatlittlepaypig: EU is always RM anyway
[6:39:20] Badasti: oh right thats the ele i was thinking of lel
[6:39:23] sind233: Its like a different tournament
[6:39:29] Hizuru1: EU more diverse
[6:39:36] Hobblefoot: It is so weird. When I watch I kept asking "Why are they even playing Outlaw"   It looks almost useless.
[6:39:36] storebraad: wow SO MANY ENH SHAMMYS :(
[6:39:44] Badasti: rogues still make up 42 of the games, in US it was 44 outlaw
[6:39:52] aaggros: the EU had a sv hunt
[6:39:53] uhdaptiv: that melee representation looks nice on eu
[6:40:00] aaggros: and a bm didnt it?
[6:40:12] zachgamegodx: outlaw could use a defensive nerf for sure
[6:40:13] Badasti: @uhdaptiv it only looks nice because Sub and Outlaw are listed separately
[6:40:38] SoAonTwitch: ret/warr just not the flavor this season i guess
[6:40:41] Badasti: if you added them together theyd dwarf every other spec, same as NA
[6:40:53] 7osei: Rogues should be able to die
[6:41:00] uhdaptiv: just bring back mld every game.. people loved that
[6:41:04] biofreaks: pie chart would have been better IMO
[6:41:06] klikka: did echo get beaten by dh ele or something
[6:41:08] baxter5569: @7osei that is exactly it. they cannot die.
[6:41:17] rawrces: think any tuning will happen for pvp this week?
[6:41:23] slaughthemage: yes
[6:41:24] Pradathelord: i mean im a rogue main
[6:41:29] Pradathelord: but i think its a necessary evil
[6:41:31] Pradathelord: though
[6:41:34] slaughthemage: warriors just needs to be better
[6:41:36] dyenamikz: your fried
[6:41:36] Pradathelord: WW sub should be able to die
[6:41:44] dooshken: Rogues will get buffed :)
[6:41:48] zachgamegodx: 8 yds
[6:41:50] slaughthemage: Warrior just need more tools to rogue
[6:41:55] dooshken: Outlaw wasn't doing enough dmg yesterdya
[6:41:55] ur_boy_jd: Rets are a great caster honestly
[6:41:56] Badasti: ye, rubber arms, and can hit you through pillars
[6:41:57] SkiaTheShade: why is outlaw the meta and not sub?
[6:42:00] ferahgok: @slaughthemage ferals just need to be better*
[6:42:05] zachgamegodx: they have 30 yd range on pistol shot and between the eyes ahha
[6:42:07] phanabananana: You bitched worse when ret was good for 3 weeks lol
[6:42:09] boundric: this is not looking like a good SP lobby
[6:42:22] slaughthemage: @ferahgok could be
[6:42:22] Pradathelord: @SkiaTheShade because outlaw does what sub does but doies more damage consistently
[6:42:44] elke_wtf: murkyt2Lewd1
[6:42:57] tangell0s: tangell0s subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! How dare you accuse known ret main Venruki of hating rets
[6:42:57] Hobblefoot: @Pradathelord Almost true. But Outlaw does not have two vanishes.
[6:42:57] uhdaptiv: idk man i think all the 1700xp rets playing at 3k in solo shuffle just put in the work and got good out of no where
[6:43:00] phanabananana: they were exactly what a rogue is now. and enabler for basically anyone that was paired with them
[6:43:16] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot outlaw has cdr on vanish, so it has more vanishes
[6:43:31] Badasti: Ven, how could you pick on poor rets when all they were doing was literally 1shotting everyone. It's not like I quit for a month or so because there was no point playing anything else in arena
[6:43:48] Pradathelord: also, rogues have had two vanishes since the beginning of time, prep just had a longer cd so you couldn't have more than two unless the game were long
[6:44:12] uhdaptiv: ^ as a rogue main the cdr is bullshit lol
[6:44:21] nuggetzwarr123: lol Im gathering conq boxes to send to my priest
[6:44:22] Pradathelord: first season of mop rogue had to choose between step and having vanish
[6:44:26] SkiaTheShade: yeah the cdr is total bullshit lol
[6:44:27] Pradathelord: and it was a complete piece of shit
[6:44:28] Divinized: anyone have this build hes using
[6:44:30] nuggetzwarr123: wizk FOTM
[6:44:39] finnybae: PogChamp
[6:44:44] SkiaTheShade: i would play solo all day if i could actually QUEUE INTO THE FUCKING GAME
[6:44:57] Pradathelord: the very first week of ret
[6:45:01] Pradathelord: you couldnt play a caster
[6:45:04] Pradathelord: cuz of judge dispel
[6:45:04] ImJordanHi: Hey Ven do you think the Proccy P will ever play ele?
[6:45:08] bit0x: @skiatheshade play healer LUL
[6:45:14] mixlife: ret was worse than dh and that says a lot
[6:45:14] tangell0s: DH was kind of up there too tbh
[6:45:16] aaggros: when are you talking about?
[6:45:21] possibly_dave: as it should be
[6:45:21] SquidSosa: 10.0.5
[6:45:23] harrystyIez: ret was the most funnest wowest thing we could ask for
[6:45:25] Pradathelord: also, rogue was super mid in s1 after they nerfed the damage of shit
[6:45:26] phanabananana: there was 3 different nerfs you cant group them from the first week into
[6:45:30] aaggros: oh right
[6:45:32] Badasti: the last time I remember something that broken was S5 back in WOTLK when holy paladins could 1 shot people for a couple weeks before it got hotfixed
[6:46:10] Dirkdigglier: Nah feral bug this xpac was the wildest thing
[6:46:16] ImJordanHi: @Badasti lmfao no shot Hpals could 1 shot ppl
[6:46:21] Pradathelord: bugs don't count as class design that oppressive
[6:46:23] Rambnesia: Crazy how fast people "Forget" How bunked Ret was initially lol It took like 5 nerfs to bring them on par with others
[6:46:26] Pradathelord: yall are crazy
[6:46:32] Cocoapuffs1: Fire mage with end of bfa with corrupted gear says hi
[6:46:32] heymomimonttv: what about those 16 hours where rdruid could hit 1m starsurges?
[6:46:43] Ronsimus: @Pradathelord this
[6:46:56] Hobblefoot: Not going to lie. I did not know that about the vanishes. I thought all rogues had that.  See I think that should be nerfed a tad then perhaps.
[6:47:08] Badasti: @ImJordanHi back in s5 they did, not in new wrath, back in the day
[6:47:13] mmatus573: When was the ret that OP ? I cant remember
[6:47:20] uhdaptiv: dhs pre a 6 or 7 straight nerfs this season were pretty wild
[6:47:32] ImJordanHi: @Badasti Bro wtf lol that's broken
[6:47:47] Badasti: it was back then
[6:47:50] finnybae: DAMN
[6:47:57] Hobblefoot: I think the things about Outlaw that need looking at are the Cloak PVP talent, the reduced cds on evasion (and vanish I guess) but I can't think of anything else.
[6:48:06] Badasti: a few expansions ago there was a patch where prot warriors were 1shottign people with  revenge as well
[6:48:13] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot yeah, and like i said, in season 12 rogue had to choose between shadowstep (being able to get to a target) and the ability to have 2 vanishes, and it was crazy how bad it was
[6:48:25] Cocoapuffs1: Cloak talent should be removed for all 3 specs
[6:48:49] Pradathelord: i think the iframe that cloak gives was an oversight
[6:48:50] Hobblefoot: @Pradathelord Oh yeah... I can get behind that as well.  Outlaw does not need Shadowstep.
[6:48:53] Pradathelord: would be cool if it were gone
[6:49:03] FollowBaba: @venruki is there anything u learned froim awc that u can apply to your own games now?
[6:49:05] ImJordanHi: The biggest issue is, regardless of whether you care or not. Blizzard clearly doesn't lol. Why even waste the time thinking about it
[6:49:05] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot its kinda funny tbh
[6:49:08] uhdaptiv: just buff under performers at this point imo
[6:49:15] Pradathelord: @uhdaptiv ya
[6:49:41] Pradathelord: i think the stam change was cringe
[6:49:50] Pradathelord: but what can ya do at this point
[6:49:52] fistweaveurnan: I like how chat is here trying to form a rocket science hypothesis about why rogue is OP when its literally just CDR that makes them unkillable set up machines.
[6:50:14] Hobblefoot: @Pradathelord As a bit if a nerd I would like to see Outlaw a bit more bland or I guess stick to a 'pirate' theme vs giving them the shit from Sub or Assassination.  I love Outlaw but I don't even care if it is "good" lol
[6:50:23] Pradathelord: its just hard to kill sub and outlaw
[6:50:43] dooshken: @venruki blink twice if there's a rogue main pointing a gun at you just off cam
[6:50:45] phanabananana: blizzard has been really good at balance for a long time now but always still get hate tbh
[6:50:47] Pradathelord: the cdr has been there as an option in the past, now you just get access to it with more builds as sub
[6:50:54] Onshuffle: put a cd on cheap shot would be a good start
[6:51:04] FollowBaba: @venruki is there anything u learned from awc that u can apply to your own games now?
[6:51:19] Rambnesia: Class Balance is always a unwinnable conversation lol
[6:51:24] Psychology_Major: Ven learned after he had every 1500 ret in existence coming after his head
[6:51:33] malvarcla: anyone know if one of the pvp addons can cause you not to be able to use a single ability?
[6:51:46] Hobblefoot: Awe ... I think it is one of the more interesting conversations. I hope none of you ruined a good talk.  Boooo chat.
[6:51:50] dilsnick: they need to buff blood DK dmg more to make them more viable
[6:51:57] Dirkdigglier: @malvarcla Addons can bug in Dragonflight. Just needs a /reload
[6:52:18] dooshken: Too many people are invested in keeping rogue on top
[6:52:20] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot i dont mind that shadow dance exists, the homoginzation sucks  sorta but its good for the class to be able to access it's main "mechanic" outside of getting a re-stealth
[6:52:32] malvarcla: @Dirkdigglier this was weird, I dc'd mid shuffle match, came back in and couldnt use a single ability even after completly closing the game
[6:52:58] Hobblefoot: @dooshken Players?
[6:53:13] Hobblefoot: @Pradathelord You have made some excellent points I must say.
[6:53:30] Pradathelord: we're just in the future and it sucks kinda
[6:53:38] Pradathelord: everyone has so much shit
[6:53:49] dooshken: @Hobblefoot Seems like it. Just had to read the chat when the discussion was happening to see all the people defending rogue
[6:54:40] Badasti: I learned that I want to learn SP
[6:54:42] Enme4: Not at all LOL
[6:54:43] deepTTV: yea find a rogue to que with
[6:54:43] tangell0s: Nah i'm perfect
[6:54:48] flames222: reroll rogue
[6:54:50] Shakertime: no man im 1800
[6:54:50] 2Noluck: That ppl dont play affli :(
[6:54:51] Bakbak4: Yea that I still have no clue what im doing lmao
[6:54:52] ckbrah: wtf void elf looks insane? no pushback seems so good
[6:54:58] dilsnick: always play with a rogue
[6:55:22] bruce_t_wayne: i learned that i suck very much in comparison
[6:55:36] nuggetzwarr123: you dont need to practise to win awc
[6:55:53] nuggetzwarr123: just turn up on the day and fk shit up
[6:57:05] Hobblefoot: @dooshken Perhaps.  I will say this. I play a ton of Outlaw and HATE when it is in the AWC and in this spot.  But I do thing a lot of people live a breath rogue (including some streamers that make a living off it) so perhaps you have a point.
[6:57:25] Hobblefoot: *do think
[6:57:29] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot i mean
[6:57:29] FollowBaba: "killing the paly" xd
[6:57:32] Pradathelord: there are some changes to make
[6:57:42] Pradathelord: but the issue with rogue is an overall game issue with everything
[6:57:57] dooshken: @Hobblefoot I play outlaw too. Seems fine RN but tbh I haven't played it much since BFA
[6:57:59] Pradathelord: random shit like pressing vanish  and shadow dance healing you for % health on press
[6:58:06] Hobblefoot: It is interesting. I am pretty sure Pikaboo never stop talking about how much he hates playing it. LOL  but I have trouble taking him serious half the time.
[6:58:28] dooshken: Pika definitely prefers sub
[6:58:35] Pradathelord: I was talking to a buddy of mine and we were saying that DK is how a class should be
[6:58:39] Pradathelord: strong but can die if it has nothing
[6:58:47] Pradathelord: if we had more of that it would be cool
[6:58:58] Pradathelord: but, its a lot to go into everyones talents and just gut shit
[6:59:06] uhdaptiv: the crazy part about all the rogue hate is if you combine both sub and outlaw representation above 2.4k in 3s from both na/eu they are still less represented than dh, dk, warr, destro/demo, ww and there are several other specs right there too.
[6:59:06] dooshken: Ehh. DKs kinda just fall over sometimes
[6:59:38] Pradathelord: @uhdaptiv yeah its just annoying for guys thtas why they're on about it
[7:00:05] Pradathelord: @dooshken they do, but imo its in a good way
[7:00:06] bruce_t_wayne: gg
[7:00:08] uloveli: beautiful:p
[7:00:08] boundric: woo!
[7:00:15] Pradathelord: cuz like, they can use resource and toolkit to live
[7:00:18] Pradathelord: but its finiate
[7:00:20] Pradathelord: finite*
[7:00:34] albag04: @venruki i know you have alot of exp, what do you think about feral druid for 2s and 3s w2ith solo?
[7:00:38] HolyXct: !uptime
[7:00:38] Moobot: @HolyXct Venruki has been streaming for 7h 45s
[7:00:42] uhdaptiv: boomy, arcane, ret are nearly as represented as outlaw/sub combined too lol
[7:00:44] Hobblefoot: I have to say I play every melee at an 1800 level right. That is basically my skill cap.  And speaking for all the players in that range.  Arms, DH, Ret, Fury all feel far easier to play and tend to do more damage.  Now where you elite players play I see your point about rogue.  The problem is that if 1800 players like me see those nerfs we are suddenly 1600 or less.
[7:01:17] malvarcla: its just op
[7:01:17] SkiaTheShade: The problem, just like with raiding, is do you balance for the 0.1% or the average player?
[7:01:22] fatlittlepaypig: rogue also struggles in shuffle because it thrives off of coordination
[7:01:26] slaughthemage: yes.. Its the necessary evil
[7:01:27] Hobblefoot: I guess it matters what you value more?  The elite players or the masses?
[7:01:28] Pradathelord: @fatlittlepaypig it CAN
[7:01:29] chrisiirc: did you win the last shuffle with sp?
[7:01:34] likeewlock: devoker
[7:01:43] chrisiirc: good work
[7:01:48] SkiaTheShade: @fatlittlepaypig This is true
[7:02:06] Bakbak4: you get the WA for catharsis and death's torment from wiz?
[7:02:16] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot we're in the world where devoker and dh are among the easiest dmg classes to pull off
[7:02:32] bruce_t_wayne: what race would you choose for a horde arcane mage?
[7:02:42] Pradathelord: nobody wants complete homogenization, but nobody wants overlap
[7:02:50] fatlittlepaypig: after playing guild wars 2 pvp the last month it's so weird that WoW doesnt have decay
[7:02:51] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The Best Specs The Pros Are Playing In PvP Right Now" view it here: youtu.be/-WB0Pe8nKKo
[7:02:56] boundric: a lot of rshams play primal tide core
[7:03:06] HolyXct: @fatlittlepaypig you mean damoening?
[7:03:06] famous1939: good for healing and added dam
[7:03:15] boundric: at least if you go off murloc.io
[7:03:16] HolyXct: @fatlittlepaypig oh you mean cr decay on ladder
[7:03:22] fatlittlepaypig: @HolyXct ladder yea
[7:03:22] dooshken: this song is classic
[7:03:33] Hobblefoot: @Pradathelord Don't get me started on how hard it is to deal with Devo ... LOL ....  I see double Devo at my MMR and I am dead meat.
[7:03:40] finnybae: nice grammar save there
[7:03:59] HolyXct: @fatlittlepaypig would make all the sitting alts go away and alot more rank 1 spots will open too which will probably increase pvp participation i assume
[7:04:06] finnybae: is this sterges build?
[7:04:11] Pradathelord: @Hobblefoot i dont even mind tbh
