[5:59:45] bip39: danSus
[5:59:46] VrtniPatuljak: sweaties gonna lose it over petrify

[6:00:08] WonderfulTimes: @ZeroSpl1nt Yah they announced they plan to add it early next year
[6:00:10] onepumpchumpo: They are 100 gold a pop and only useful for dungeons tho
[6:00:10] meh_ninja_please: WabbitHatter not typically no but it can happen
[6:00:15] Nazzmul: @Chroma_bsx party
[6:00:18] Zellidon: @Chroma_bsx yea it's rough, on my 4th priest now
[6:00:18] Xkorpitron: i disagree with the flask dan
[6:00:23] Wrenton: @manyfist Vanilla,  TBC, and Wrath.  With server resets  every year andca half.
[6:00:23] styxas88: They're taking the gnomes to Isengard
[6:00:25] LRonHoover: @mdunn111 danKEK I was commenting on Dan saying a ppaly could just nope out when things got iffy
[6:00:33] LRonHoover: *pally
[6:00:35] konejeesus: they are in the game, so :p
[6:00:37] Xkorpitron: anyone can use the flask, unlike the paladin ability
[6:00:43] NoMoreSadness: did i miss deadmines
[6:00:48] VrtniPatuljak: I played vanilla, never knew Petrification flask EXISTED LUL
[6:00:50] 80percentwinDM: Long cd
[6:00:53] el3gantbanana: use the aspect to go faster ;)
[6:00:59] Lionkingler1: just up the timer to like 3 minutes
[6:01:01] Suvaacc: @Zellidon nah, that wouldnt help, since you can just spam petri, change would be to make pteri timer like 20s or smth max so it wouldnt be worth it to carry so many with you
[6:01:01] Elogain: Is the idea that all people in OnlyFangs wipe in a 40 man raid?
[6:01:03] GenericallyNamed: Petri flask just kills you now
[6:01:04] onepumpchumpo: thats fair
[6:01:11] WabbitHatter: @meh_ninja_please HC is super fun but still not for me...would just take too much time to level a new char and i dont have that patience. :)
[6:01:13] mondtier22: true
[6:01:16] jackalo34: Flasks at least require consumable n aren't class specific plus u can still mess up using it
[6:01:22] MarexDS: you can still die in dungeons even with petri if you do it wrong, I think it's fine
[6:01:23] meh_ninja_please: WabbitHatter same

[6:01:36] konataizumi1982: @WabbitHatter same
[6:01:37] ExaUnique: cockroach pull would be crazy without petrify
[6:01:44] MarexDS: it's not like a button that instantly saves you
[6:01:47] Xkorpitron: the thing wih the flask, is unlike paladin exclusive ability, anyone can use the flask, that's where i draw the line, where is fair or not.
[6:01:51] Lionkingler1: leave party and click petri. not much too mess up there
[6:02:01] VrtniPatuljak: I wonder if that was the flasks intended purpose
[6:02:05] konataizumi1982: Even in Diablo HC has never appealed to me
[6:02:06] LRonHoover: danSus bizness
[6:02:12] mondtier22: it kinda is if ur in dungeon

[6:43:04] Oolert: yeah leveling is my favorite part of WoW
[6:43:04] Fiendishfiend: Yeah hardcore really makes it much more intense plus you got vanilla which was great
[6:43:04] Donomonovan: did we lose kevinbacon danSad
[6:43:07] Holdthepickle629: I like old wow philosophy
[6:43:08] Manyfist: Leveling was exploring the world but now it’s all about endgame
[6:43:09] LRonHoover: frog legs prolly danKEK2
[6:43:13] meh_ninja_please: mdunn111 what are we havin danDrool
[6:43:13] moocat: Grinding dailies vs. grinding levels

[6:43:25] meh_ninja_please: Donomonovan owls are better sadly danSad
[6:43:26] Xkorpitron: Wow became too casual
[6:43:27] Fiendishfiend: Yeah I remember how much of an achievement it was for me to get my horse ha
[6:43:29] Draikose: Yeah, that mentality affected all other MMO's that came out after WoW. Always just gotta get to the end game...
[6:43:30] metalwrath22222: i played mmos for leveling part, so now I can't find any mmos to play other than old ones
[6:43:34] Fiendishfiend: And then getting to level 60
[6:43:35] Zimmy99: yeah you reach max lvl half way through the story now danHmm
[6:43:36] Oolert: they keep speeding up leveling in retail, it makes me so sad
[6:43:40] bodvahr: That is what made me quit...
[6:43:42] Putster: Now you get 1 level every dungeon run
[6:43:45] Xierany: Mkaing it all about the endgame makes the world so much smaller
[6:43:50] Donomonovan: @meh_ninja_please danSad
[6:43:52] JT_Matey: Originally the game was about the 'World' of Warcraft. Now it's dungeons & raids of Warcraft.
[6:44:01] VrtniPatuljak: @metalwrath22222 maybe youd like guild wars2
[6:44:07] Fiendishfiend: Yeah you don’t get to see all what the world has to offer with fast leveling
[6:44:12] XenonZack: Hey Dan, danHi  did you finish Cyberpunk 2077 phantom liberty?
[6:44:14] Xkorpitron: @meh_ninja_please as a hunter main i have 3 pets the white cerberus ,the hydra and the monkey pet
[6:44:17] LRonHoover: danUgh MMO repitition finally got to me, but back in EQ1 when it was 1st 3D MMO was pretty great
[6:44:18] Fiendishfiend: So many memories
[6:44:23] Alexlistair: when i first tried WoW i felt really easy to lvl up, but now watching you playing classic, feels like it's taking a LOT of time
[6:44:25] metalwrath22222: VrtniPatuljak yeah its good
[6:44:28] Fiendishfiend: I still remember world pvp too
[6:44:29] McCrank: the end game rush is terrible
[6:44:32] PartlyAtomic: for comparison, it takes for-fucking-ever to get to current content in FFXIV (I mean it's worth it, but when you wanna play with friends that are at current..)
[6:44:35] andaroo: all MMOs go through this - once people start spreading out ramming a core group of people through the same door - you lose people
[6:44:39] Mac3232: wish I could play old WoW but with all the new shiny models
[6:44:41] muehldozer: I like old WoW more, but retail works better for me now that I have a job and family
[6:44:43] McCrank: nothing matters except end game.
[6:44:46] xabrecell: and killing half the living creatures in the world so you can ascend in level LUL
