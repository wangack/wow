[4:27:46] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:27:47] mcvegs: I feel like you should be allowed to trade with fellow hc players
[4:28:02] Ezcotli: its so you cant get twinked
[4:28:14] shackt1: doesnt enchanting have?
[4:28:19] duarte_raffle: SW have Wand vendor @Swifty
[4:28:50] mcvegs: maybe you could trade with people within 5 levels

[4:28:58] Dogjah: No way not in a WOW game?
[4:28:58] husbandhusband: level limit in groups
[4:29:04] PaEu: nah you cant trade
[4:29:07] noenken: Well ... don't pay upfront. xD
[4:29:11] CardinalTX: carries on "hardcore" would be silly
[4:29:26] NotSchmede: maybe they only allow groups for people who are in 5 level range
[4:29:31] lxSecondarys: ALMOST MOUNT TIME!!!!!!
[4:29:32] PaEu: ofc they wont do that xD
[4:29:39] EvoCyberNation: That's an unfortunate normal. I don't think Blizz cares. When Blizz sales tokens, they make money from it.
[4:29:47] lovesvictoria221: Do you think you will be able to clear all content to nax without dying?
[4:29:56] duarte_raffle: If is like that, isn;t hardcore at all @Swifty  Hardcore comuunity won't join since the addon does a better job
[4:30:09] PaEu: why would they announce hardcore servers and just release it like a normal server?
[4:30:13] lxSecondarys: Wait its classic, so not until 40
[4:30:26] Veleos2: Just ban trading lol
[4:30:33] lovesvictoria221: then whats the point of HC if you cant clear all raid content?
[4:31:11] luckyydayy10: ony cloaks for bwl?

[4:32:24] PaEu: someone did on HC in molten core yesterday, on EU
[4:32:27] ajmiller7: @swifty are you enjoying classic wrath or retail better?😃
[4:32:27] vSERAv: Leeeeeerrrooooyyy
[4:32:35] Ettan_Bak: Yo, what's up SWIFTY, How you been doing my friend? what are we up to today?
[4:32:40] noenken: You know what they should do? If you make it to 60 you should be able to switch onto an eternal vanilla realm with all the other HC 60s.
[4:32:50] PaEu: No not all of it but one guy died

[4:36:00] noenken: Bloodsail Buccaneers
[4:36:16] xplosivspleenz: You can get a wand from iron forge vendor if needed when lvl 20, save travelling to SW, unless you’re going to deadmines ofc
[4:36:22] LEAC0LE: its harder by yourself.
[4:36:23] JESTER_XP: Hardcore swifty is my favorite streamer ATM lol
[4:36:42] MilManson: Hardcore should be an official Blizzard thing, extending into different expansions and if you die its back to classic.
