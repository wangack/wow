[1:43:00] Rad_Red15: 16 games at 50% win rate means 32 games
[1:43:02] diarog: But each RBG is way longer
[1:43:04] Ionait: 50% win rate is 32 games and that's a total of 16hrs
[1:43:20] nympheteminefix: 16 hours if you do math right
[1:43:21] Feeos: ^
[1:43:26] diarog: Thats not bad
[1:43:29] diarog: 50 wins?
[1:43:34] diarog: that's like nothing
[1:43:46] diarog: way less than 10 min
[1:43:47] eddf96: less
[1:43:52] eddf96: for 2s?
[1:43:57] Bitis: 5 mins tops
[1:43:59] abolick888: 2-5mins

[1:44:22] GrayZeny: blizzard calculated this EZ Clap
[1:44:24] nympheteminefix: why are you dividing by 12?
[1:44:25] Area51Labs: divide min by 60
[1:44:25] Feeos: ÷ by 60
[1:44:26] Ionait: what kinda math is that? 750min is 12.5 hours
[1:44:32] Kastraios: one minute is 60 seconds
[1:44:33] diarog: 100 games

[1:45:58] parabellum2213: correct
[1:45:58] Bitis: Even if it were only like 10-15 conquest per loss
