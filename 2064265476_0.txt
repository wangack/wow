It's a bit of a philosophical question and depends on how one conceptualizes and defines a sperg.

[7:31:17] FlumbyTV: If you want to play classic you are going to have to put effort in, I know retail hands it to you on a plate with no effort. If gnomergan is that difficult, when you clear it it’s far more rewarding.
[7:31:18] rustycans: I want it to be harder than naxx but easier than ICC HC

[7:34:54] HappysFunPalace: trihards ruin everything
[7:34:56] xo_navi: @JokerdTV i think accessibility is a big factor. 10 man vs 40 man allows people to even get into the raid.
[7:34:59] Dazzpa: they maybe wanna sell boosts on sod
[7:35:06] cybertrolled: Baseg they should have added dryad race
[7:35:07] boopbopbamski: anyone saying the devs should make the raids really hard are clueless about the classic community
