[2:18:25] Thel_1: @Fancyxo Training healers is extremely effective and all top teams do it depending on the matches. In high end arenas when both teams skill wise are insanely good. Bursting a healer down is incredibly effective to not give the other skilled team a chance to set up other kills. Thus everyone trains for the most part. LUL
