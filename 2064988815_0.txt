[1:25:03] Doribob1: MUGA
[1:25:06] Tizzlefix: bruh no wonder u think there's nothing to do lmaoo
[1:25:07] Voidbonx: HYPERS

[1:26:47] TrooperHuge: can you explain more about this STV event?
[1:26:50] shungilungi: arathi rep is back?
[1:26:53] paulthecat: NO WAY
[1:26:53] TrooperHuge: how do you get rep?
[1:26:59] wavecadet: You can get exalted lol
[1:27:56] NormanBates420: how are you addicted to P2? lmao there's LITERALLY nothing to do besides AB/STV and both are boring af after 100 of each
[1:28:08] Tizzlefix: @NormanBates420 most of us aren't 40 yet
[1:28:33] NormanBates420: right. go on
[1:28:43] MaxMx__: 1000 times faster for ab rep thank the gods
[1:28:47] Raisenette: what do you need revered for?
[1:28:54] numblezzz: if youve grinded the fuck out of the game and burnt out, then just stop playing
[1:28:55] WhoHazCake: people rush to 40 then cry theres nothing to do classic
[1:28:58] tsetse2fly: @TrooperHuge Kill others during the event, get blood > turn in to bronze coins > turn coins into lumber > turn in lumber at quest giver
[1:29:02] NormanBates420: so  alts fair enough
[1:29:02] kcm92: is the ab rep items really locked behind class specific?
[1:29:06] Batresh: !uptime
[1:29:06] Nightbot: 1 hour 29 minutes 13 seconds
[1:29:14] Tizzlefix: im already friendly with AB before hitting 40
[1:29:16] lickmypetals: Do u think they nerf final boss for gnomere?
[1:29:17] Tizzlefix: havent done stv once
[1:29:20] nearoz123: its bs pretty much all bis phase 2 is all in gnomer
[1:29:23] MaxMx__: if you lost every ab its like 630 hours or something and if you win them its like 68 hours so this rep gain from stv is HUGE!
[1:29:44] joLyole: can you put the druid xp tab thing up again that was cool
[1:30:00] wavecadet: KEKL
[1:30:01] Minimanyrekt: how much was it per game ?
[1:30:04] Zerksyera: trolled
[1:30:05] comptnn: meh only 2 days
[1:30:07] KingQueenAce: typical KEKL
[1:30:10] cyonara74: so need 15 silver for neutral-friendly correct?
[1:30:10] kalsizzle2: they added lumber?
[1:30:14] Mattysaiyan: But now you'll be revered
[1:30:19] brentosxd: they removed that quest
[1:30:20] aoe_enjoyer: It goes both ways
[1:30:23] Polarmensch: has anyone seen ppl selling dungeon boosts yet in p2?
[1:30:24] MaxMx__: 220 for me :P
[1:30:24] cyonara74: 30 for friendly to honored
[1:30:36] wavecadet: SHHHH
[1:30:47] spike82q: but than how are the dad gamers goign get ab rep
[1:30:50] NormanBates420: you should farm outside gnomer for grime to make your tailoring helm, took me around 15hrs
[1:30:55] chazburner: no shot
[1:31:03] kalsizzle2: I cba farming that shit
[1:31:06] numblezzz: as a pvper, i dont understand the obsession with making the pvp grinds hours and hours
[1:31:13] smander: wait they added the rep back in?
[1:31:16] numblezzz: in classic
[1:31:19] BleedzUK: its not to much BGs just dont give enough rep
[1:31:24] cyonara74: 1 silver = 200 rep
[1:31:28] mohihe3834: important message
[1:31:40] nearoz123: whats the penalty in stv for being in a group?
[1:31:55] MaxMx__: @nearoz123  nothing if its a 5 man but radi they get a debuff
[1:31:55] cyonara74: no i think 1 silver should = 1000 rep
[1:32:01] MaxMx__: raid*
[1:32:05] kalsizzle2: thats hundreds of silver coins to get exalted
[1:32:05] zaebot3000: how are people getting that many coins? I got 120 coins from 1 stv event and it was hard to do
[1:32:07] Maruika: i think they should just max everyones rep when you ding 40
[1:32:14] jaynkumz: its an incentive to stay in stv
[1:32:16] electric_f33l: YEP
[1:32:19] JamesRig: NODDERS
[1:32:22] lickmypetals: We need more ethical things in SOD like NERFING MELEE HUNTER
[1:32:23] Maruika: good idea
[1:32:28] Mattysaiyan: Nah fuck that
[1:32:36] Mattysaiyan: Don't make it mandatory to farm
[1:32:37] MaxMx__: i feel bad for the people who bought the stv mount i saw a few lol
[1:32:39] chazburner: 24 STVs to honored would be absurd
[1:32:41] cyonara74: mount will be gone at end of season
[1:32:42] numblezzz: biggest issue with hunter is they get spell pushback with their bows and cat
[1:32:46] MaxMx__: lost all that rep
[1:32:47] tsetse2fly: A lot of people give a fuck about the cosmetic
[1:32:54] originmorii: @Mattysaiyan 5% isnt mndatory lmfao
[1:33:07] NormanBates420: naa they need to spawn people from the sky on a goblin glider. it's inevitable
[1:33:19] brentosxd: @StaysafeTV did u get exalted with warsong for the bracers
[1:33:23] tsetse2fly: basically carrot on a stick
[1:33:31] XxLurK: thats pretty might like a minor speed increase
[1:33:34] XxLurK: i like the idea
[1:33:37] WhoHazCake: FeelsGoodMan Clap
[1:33:42] paulthecat: i would do it for 5%
[1:33:49] origin727: Somehow our guild is over run with autists in SoD
[1:33:49] WhoHazCake: love me a mindless grind
[1:33:53] chazburner: STV event will have longevity when the PvP isn't 3 globals a fight
[1:33:57] adrenoid95: or that it scales with ur riding skill
[1:34:08] numblezzz: autistic grinds for small but satisfying rewards are crucial
[1:34:17] madgarlicjr: YEP
[1:34:22] electric_f33l: YEP 󠀀
[1:34:27] Slaanesh74: fun is good for a couple weeks
[1:34:27] cjadude: true
[1:34:27] madgarlicjr: we need to fill that whole in our life with something
[1:34:27] Tizzlefix: what
[1:34:32] Tizzlefix: most of the casuals i talk too
[1:34:35] Tizzlefix: do not parrot what ur saying
[1:34:42] Tizzlefix: i mean people that are barely lv 35
[1:34:43] tsetse2fly: DansGame FUN
[1:34:49] wavecadet: 99 fun parse
[1:34:50] madgarlicjr: we have a void in our heart we need to fill with pretend pixel things
[1:34:51] numblezzz: i enjoy grinding, it gives me dopamine....as long as im getting something that gives me a bonus
[1:35:02] wazza891: 3 fun
[1:35:06] electric_f33l: GIMME MA MOUNT SPEED PLS
[1:35:07] TomCat: some catnip... bonkers... pounce even... just give me some kind of reward for playing the game
[1:35:37] TomCat: Mr. Safe - wtf is that buffet? been waiting a long while for you to move it to the garage where I can "supervise" it
[1:35:44] nearoz123: a carrot
[1:35:45] spike82q: rank 6 bite take forever to learn
[1:35:45] paulthecat: nah thats shit
[1:35:50] lickmypetals: Can u kill the STV boss?
[1:35:50] Slaanesh74: I think since the social aspect of wow died about 10 years ago. they need more reasons to play
[1:35:52] Mattysaiyan: That I'd be down with rather than the mount being 65
[1:36:05] Krawnixx: mount speed enchant
[1:36:09] Polarmensch: can u not get the carrot yet?
[1:36:22] Mattysaiyan: Can't enter ZF so can't get carrot @Polarmensch
[1:36:32] numblezzz: i think the sod devs are pretty in touch for the grinds
[1:36:37] Arcsilin: whip trinket
[1:36:40] numblezzz: excited to see what they make
[1:36:42] Vespyyr: You can't enter ZF? I saw someone looking for a group for it earlier
[1:36:52] Oreo_Swagwagon: Just imagine the 50 and 60 epic crafting questlines
[1:36:56] sighwarlock: skull too?
[1:37:15] Macrel: has people killed the final boss of uldaman? Or is that just too hard
[1:37:21] Polarmensch: a paladin i was grouped up earlier definetly was riding faster then me
[1:37:26] Sowiloo: because it's a pvp item
[1:37:28] Sowiloo: you don't pvp
[1:37:29] sighwarlock: i use it while getting dmt buffs ICANT
[1:37:32] thaplayboy69: i used to use it a lot vs mage or hunter as a rogue
[1:37:32] chazburner: skull is bis
[1:37:33] Mattysaiyan: I've literally only used it to corpse run faster in a dungeon/raid KEKW
[1:37:34] thaplayboy69: its a pvp item
[1:37:34] iamharmor: agreed
[1:37:35] hassokek: people in my guild have like 5 40s and I feel like I'm too far behind
[1:37:37] Polarmensch: does running speed on boots add to ur mounted speed?
[1:37:37] ironbull007: good for tourmeys
[1:37:40] Tizzlefix: what
[1:37:41] ironbull007: thats it
[1:37:41] Tizzlefix: skull?
[1:37:42] thaplayboy69: nah you use it as a rogue 100%

[1:37:48] dispensaryttv: @hassokek nah they fucking nerds
[1:37:50] thaplayboy69: i used to use it all the time vs hunter
[1:37:52] Tizzlefix: i def use it a bunch in pvp on vanilla servers
[1:37:53] Tizzlefix: not tbc obv
[1:37:54] thaplayboy69: and mage
[1:38:05] deathdemonic99: yo bro
[1:38:09] thaplayboy69: it depends on your class really, but yeah pvpers defs use it
[1:38:17] aoe_enjoyer: @staysafetv what class are you least likely to ever play
[1:38:24] Macrel: how much gnomeregan gear has he gotten
[1:38:42] deathdemonic99: i cant seem to find any good gold farms any idea what i should do for gold these days <3

[1:40:01] Polarmensch: fishing is pretty good, no?

[1:41:27] d3labeled: perfect way to wash the gold
[1:41:29] fgaudreau05: Am I the only one who finds that we are already at the end of phase 2 and there's nothing else to do but Gnomer?
[1:41:30] Hensonr1: Theyre all bots
[1:41:37] Doribob1: i paid 3g to get the kargath summons
[1:41:41] Polarmensch: the questions is, what to spend ur gold on in sod
[1:41:42] chazburner: 3g summons for the sleeping bag quest was good money
[1:41:46] halfwayz6531: He will appeal
[1:41:50] lagginginironforge: fair

[1:43:17] lagginginironforge: yes, the banks
[1:43:19] Xara36: theres not even a victim
[1:43:19] DeadDawg68: yeah, the banks lol
[1:43:21] ScarfaceCEO: Imagine thinking the bank didn’t scrutinize his property value before giving him a loan LUL
[1:43:41] lagginginironforge: no one lost any money. Theres no victims, its so silly
[1:43:43] numblezzz: definitely not politically motivated with ideologue judges
[1:43:57] carlos_dang3r: in a sane world, it would be overturned in the appeal process
[1:44:03] Plathyy: food on counter
[1:44:04] timbotwotime: cock pushups

[1:46:10] Gabe4D: it comes across as really shady and desperate
[1:46:14] Wrettchh: they dont care lol
[1:46:19] unscconnor2: They waited for him to announce his running for them to come down hard with all these bogus charges too. Its not like they did it as soon as he left office
[1:46:22] Gabe4D: its 2016 all over again
[1:46:26] Gabe4D: every time they attack him
[1:46:26] Bambambm: I love these people. "I haven't seen a single shred of evidence! its a witch hunt!".. These people never even take a second to actually LOOK at the court proceedings and evidence they lay out. There's actual evidence, look at the court documents..

[1:47:01] Plathyy: chipotle quesadillas are so good
[1:47:06] tsetse2fly: @staysafetv honestly wish there was that type of scrutiny with every politician
[1:47:08] chazburner: similarly supporters of trump could recognize it's a little bit crazy he is surrounded by *that* many felonies
[1:47:16] lagginginironforge: @StaysafeTV
[1:47:22] Polarmensch: GDKS's are banned but boosting (other ppl for gold) isnt , no?

[1:48:15] Bambambm: @Xara36 I don't purposely lie about the value of my house to pay lower taxes, then inflate the value of the same house to get loans against it. FFS, its not the same thing.....
[1:48:15] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV i was lurking your morning stream this morning cause i was working, but it seems Trump is more positively recieved during NA hours than EU hours
[1:48:25] cheesed_bucktee: Boosting while making money hmm seems shady write that down
[1:48:26] ScootSmith: what lvl is the druid now?
[1:48:30] dispensaryttv: keyvan trying o7

[1:48:37] numblezzz: EU has been heavily propagandized regarding trump
[1:48:39] lagginginironforge: Thats because EU is low T
[1:48:46] SmokeBuddha: @Bambambm you can't just lie about the value of your home, jackass. Appraisers exist for exactly this reason
[1:48:48] lickmypetals: thats cause trump told EU to get fuked and pay for their shit
[1:48:49] numblezzz: atleast the western countries
[1:49:02] Eat_a_Cow: @lagginginironforge  glizzyL
[1:49:03] Xara36: @Bambambm Yes you do, you 100% do, go get your tax document and see if you pay the full tax value on your house, you dont.  But you have a loan for your house for more than that amount
[1:49:04] MaybeRespect: EU is a sespool like the US but without the freedom of speech we enjoy. So makes it worse

[1:49:33] petjii: this autumn
[1:49:33] Plathyy: german/swedish media always talked about how bad trump is but never much about hillary or biden
[1:49:35] Solkos: I don't think Trump is being sued much mroe than he was before his presidency.   There are several big ones too like Trump university and so on.  It's just publicised more now
[1:49:36] hassokek: Im south american and politics in na just look like a reality show at this point
[1:49:37] Gabe4D: its because trump embodies the "usa #1" mentality, which europeans got sick of in the post 9/11 period
[1:49:52] SmokeBuddha: @boofadose its not europeans bro, its chronically online euro losers who don't touch grass
[1:49:55] Plathyy: like many people in europe dont even know who trump is running against
[1:50:05] EmanuShow: Swede natiolists likes trump^^

[1:50:10] petjii: @StaysafeTV and what media should u watch? LUL FOX NEWS XDXDXD?
[1:50:10] numblezzz: europeans get insecure about the hegemony of america in western politics. guess what, we pay for NATO and won world war 2
[1:50:16] Sowiloo: I agree with that
[1:50:24] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV I agree, im just saying, its perceived the same way en masse
[1:50:25] DeadDawg68: it's not #1 it america first

[1:50:57] Polarmensch: in EU
[1:51:02] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV yes i agree, its just perceived the same way with propaganda
[1:51:02] coeursiy: how do europeans cope with the "america #1 thing" considering their entire continent is cucked to US culture and foreign policy
[1:51:07] MaybeRespect: Well, that doesn't need to be said, it's known. :)
[1:51:09] numblezzz: @deathdemonic99 can you read?
[1:51:13] ironbull007: for sure tho its ok to care about your country.

[1:52:26] Gabe4D: @Grandmarshal I agree, im just saying many europeans probably take it as similar and it makes it easier to propagandize trump
[1:52:30] Eat_a_Cow: Straw men are.
[1:52:31] QuestFor420: Fox news is the best news station
[1:52:37] Sowiloo: aren't they anti Biden
[1:52:39] MaybeRespect: That's what CNN says about republicans. Ironic he brought up fox news when he's regurgitating leftist propaganda

[2:26:54] CringeK: How do you think this zone event compares to Ashenvale? Better or worse?
[2:27:06] letsgetgoingyo: way more fun than ashenvale
[2:27:13] letsgetgoingyo: if you like pvp that is.
[2:27:15] chrisblackmo: ashenvale wasnt even pvp
[2:27:24] fafoo204: ashenvale was rep farm sim

[2:33:13] Raivan994: no ress timer sells it for me
[2:33:15] SaucyRMD: Feels like they fixed the layers today
[2:33:17] spike82q: if your boomkin , paladin , or warlock the event has a better perspective i think
[2:33:40] fafoo204: could just be less ppl doing it
[2:33:48] Raivan994: there's more layers i think
[2:34:09] clozer_kek: Wesley stream Snipes needs to get a job.

[2:34:53] SaucyRMD: SPriest cause Dispersion is broken
[2:34:53] thatquidproquo: Hunter
[2:34:54] caltex88: Melee lock or Aff Demon lock
[2:34:59] nearoz123: hunters suck pvp
[2:35:01] Sohsuh: Priest
[2:35:04] LoRswat: Spriest won the tourney, but not sure if they're the best in open world?  Top 3 for sure
[2:35:04] clover_north: boomkin and hunter. rogue crushes boomkin tho
[2:35:11] Sohsuh: SPriest easily
[2:35:19] Ariosity: @nearoz123 melee hunter one shots
[2:35:22] MajurDJ: did you guys not see the S priest changes today? shadow word death base damage reduced by 40% and its SP coefficient was reduced
[2:35:38] nearoz123: @Ariosity havent seen one yet
[2:35:39] spike82q: a group of 5 boomkins  is straight cancer in this event
[2:35:41] caltex88: Melee hunter is so next on the nerf bat

[2:36:08] chrisblackmo: like today
[2:36:08] Mertauh: part of the recent change YEP
[2:36:10] thatquidproquo: Good change
[2:36:20] clover_north: as a boomkin I would much rather take a real front line into stv than 3 other boomkins and a healer
[2:36:42] clover_north: someone has to peel for me or i get clapped instantly. boomkin form is a big target
[2:37:48] Raivan994: way better than boss rush
[2:37:57] chrisblackmo: what do u think about adding a tenacity type thing for people playing solo
[2:38:02] chrisblackmo: feel like that could be cool
[2:38:04] clozer_kek: power creep -.o
[2:38:10] MrSchneetzel: should be a ffa but instead its party v party
[2:38:24] caltex88: Need to add rep reward tokens to give people a reason to keep doing it
[2:38:41] caltex88: oh cool

[2:40:23] wavecadet: its actually fun lol
[2:40:29] Mertauh: this event was fixable, the ashenvale event was not
[2:40:32] sweatlordkush: and they're nerfing priests :D
[2:40:40] spike82q: @Raivan994  okay thats makes more sense at least
[2:40:42] charlesrrr: where do you turn in coins for ab rep?
[2:41:22] Shweady: When is ancient aliens coming back
[2:41:38] pizzadad212: 100 coins to 200 rep is pretty good honestly. not too much but enough to get the sweats interested

[2:46:41] fafoo204: i mean, it was just as easy to get WSG
[2:46:41] Raivan994: nah
[2:46:46] lagginginironforge: Cash in
[2:46:49] Solkos: most ppl don't get 1500 coins per run
[2:46:54] SaucyRMD: They need to sell WSG tokens and then do a weekly limit of AB ones
[2:46:54] fafoo204: WSG rev was free asf
[2:46:55] BinksMagnus: how do you get a coin? HKs?
[2:46:58] madgarlicjr: people have like 10 alts tho lol
[2:47:08] Raivan994: AB rep rewards aren't as relevant as the wsg ones , at least not until 60

[2:47:53] MrSchneetzel: dagger gives 70 armor as well
[2:48:02] MrSchneetzel: plus 40 armor off hand somewhere im sure
[2:48:48] Solkos: considering you get 1000 free WSG rep a week from ashen, I don;'t think 200/100 coins is unreasonable
[2:48:59] h2h_nillz: you could go engineering for the Gnomer Belt, it has hit on it
[2:49:02] exxxtended: hiding in a corner

[5:40:09] mysteriousm4n: how many coins did u get in that 1 event?
[5:40:11] plae007: u can do AB rep through the coins? have they had that the whole time?
[5:40:16] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  for tanking survivability do you think Demonic Tactics + Dance of the Wicked is better than using  Dance of the Wicked + Master Channeler?
[5:40:16] HeIlraiser_: ofc let the boosted get the rewards and the legit play suffer lol so blizzard
[5:40:17] MrSchneetzel: ok i got 500 coins i guess im not THAT depressed
[5:40:21] cyonara74: i can never find a healer
[5:40:27] linkitcraig: who told u he was by ZG?
[5:40:32] osopolar1977: I will rep
[5:40:32] AntarcticTreaty: have priest healers is the advice
[5:40:33] erawin1990: thanks
[5:40:38] NooleanB: I was watching the vod where you were talking about the gum vendor...  I know you don't want to give him any more money, but could you offer him a $1k if he fulfills the order by March?  If he's rich like you said I guess he might not care.
[5:40:45] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  whats broken about Arathi Rep?
[5:41:04] linkitcraig: that seems reasonable
[5:41:05] MatreTV: why fight arround the boss?
[5:41:07] osopolar1977: I will be a priest
[5:41:16] mysteriousm4n: why would they nerf it
[5:41:18] cyonara74: too late to nerf
[5:41:19] Misterballe: where do you turn in coins for rep?
[5:41:19] yaboyKobra: why fight around the boss ?
[5:41:20] speedzombie: since its seasonal server maybe not
[5:41:22] osopolar1977: like Craig
[5:41:26] Arcsilin: dont give them ideas SS
[5:41:26] plae007: @MatreTV the aura it gives off (debuff on you) gives you 3x the blood for kills
[5:41:28] HeIlraiser_: do you ever think of others lol
[5:41:34] Arcsilin: shush ur mouth
[5:41:35] vAtsokk: ¨why would you go AB at all then xD
[5:41:42] linkitcraig: how many coinns u think avg player is getting?
[5:41:44] osopolar1977: yes
[5:42:04] HeIlraiser_: so why should the boosted players get it and not the slow casual player
[5:42:07] 99deece: but you would do ashenvale every two hours and get like 1200 rep, consider that.
[5:42:10] AmarokUnchained: NODDERS
[5:42:10] MrSchneetzel: this plus mount has enough longevity
[5:42:12] Sowiloo: it should give after revered
[5:42:14] divadnothsa: Alts
[5:42:15] linkitcraig: it took 1k kills to get 2k rep
[5:42:15] osopolar1977: ooh ohh
[5:42:16] Sowiloo: shouldn't
[5:42:18] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV you should wait and turn in lumber after they nerf it
[5:42:21] linkitcraig: 1k blood*
[5:42:24] gitzw: prob only works til revered like ashenvale did for wsg

[5:42:43] spike82q: if they  min max it , yes,
[5:42:50] linkitcraig: how much blood is avg player getting during event?
[5:42:55] spike82q: but say a group with no heals goes
[5:43:01] bonemagus: 5-8
[5:43:02] AmarokUnchained: what if only wors till revered?
[5:43:02] osopolar1977: it’s my life now or never
[5:43:08] Vespyyr: They shouldn't balance the game around players who play 18 hours a day
[5:43:13] AmarokUnchained: *if it works
[5:43:18] Bennska: Dad gamer shouldnt have like bis, all exalted lul
[5:43:37] mrmangasm: already bored
[5:43:38] Jessrabbit1: i'm not even 40 yet

[5:43:54] diarrerik: and gnomer gears sucks
[5:43:55] osopolar1977: 🦜🦜 older people
[5:43:56] Hakios: im level 28 bro
[5:43:59] leech0000: i have 11 kids, i can only play 10 min a night.
[5:44:01] cyonara74: rebirth*
[5:44:04] lequani: moving house soon?
[5:44:05] endraga1: i rerrolled my druid im starting at 1
[5:44:06] Aeycka__: In the military there was a saying "always in a hurry to get into waiting". And I think that applies to the vast majority of dad gamers and redditors 😁
[5:44:09] HeIlraiser_: im only level 36 and I still gota level a alt
[5:44:09] NooleanB: Add ZA as a lvl 40 raid and put it in hinterlands :D
[5:44:14] T0T4LAnxiety: i work 50h a week. im just hitting 40
[5:44:19] peatear69: u play 20x more than the avg player lmao
[5:44:21] Fuxtic_Actual: im still 35
[5:44:25] MrSchneetzel: most fun phase btw
[5:44:27] NotDessx: I have two 40s now
[5:44:28] mrmangasm: I'm not excited to run gnomer and the pvp event has been terrible and unplayable for me
[5:44:28] bonemagus: But it's perfect for average players. You log at evening for 2-3 hrs and enjoy pvp
[5:44:30] osopolar1977: I remember my part time job
[5:44:36] lickmypetals: How much did u get from this event?
[5:44:50] Voidbonx: Peggers
[5:44:52] osopolar1977: >(
[5:44:57] Metaphix: yeah but most ppl play less than you though
[5:45:11] dave3ooo: v tru
[5:45:11] NooleanB: badges of justice a good addition?  That would give something to farm
[5:45:11] erawin1990: thats why i have 5 alts
[5:45:11] plae007: @Metaphix thats literally what hes saying lol
[5:45:13] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  i feel like the rep being available through Bloodmoon completly removed the queues from AB havent queues are like 20 mins
[5:45:14] mrmangasm: hopefully this phase is over soon
[5:45:14] AmarokUnchained: tell em NODDERS
[5:45:15] cjadude: ur so crazy for saying this
[5:45:15] spicykurii: that was just like p1? you just raid log
[5:45:16] Raym9nd: raid logging ftw
[5:45:18] tsetse2fly: Think you're over estimating the avg player, but in general I agree
[5:45:24] mrmangasm: the main content of this phase is just leveling imho
[5:45:24] osopolar1977: I’m still 25 kek
[5:45:26] Metaphix: @plae007 just fuckin with the streamer lol
[5:45:31] crunkbub: I am already raid logging.
[5:45:32] madgarlicjr: iz gonna be okay ABDULpls
[5:45:43] Sowiloo: you want people to grind more
[5:45:44] KrotonGG: I think its ok that its very rewarding doing Blood Moon. Especially if you're min-maxing your distance from the boss etc. I don't think the answer is to make the AB grind take longer per character.
[5:45:46] Sowiloo: that's no new content tho
[5:45:47] endraga1: FirstTimeChadder
[5:45:47] peatear69: i get your point and agree man, im just saying i think its going to last a bit longer than what youre saying
[5:45:49] iknowido: im prepping for 60 already lol
[5:45:52] plae007: @Metaphix ah cant decipher the trolls from the actually confused xD
[5:45:54] Raym9nd: artificially creating time sinks isn't the solution to the lack of content
[5:45:59] osopolar1977: yep it’s over
[5:45:59] silimoore7767: That is called timegating and not a good idea imo
[5:46:00] seksmuhchine: :*(
[5:46:00] HeIlraiser_: I cant even get quest done because surrounded by horde LUL
[5:46:02] NutterCircus: It will just be empty
[5:46:02] thatquidproquo: KEKL
[5:46:03] AmarokUnchained: or cap the bloodcoin  Arathi rep at revered
[5:46:05] MFpatrix: Chat is pepega today
[5:46:06] QuestFor420: I dont like your attitude rn !
[5:46:07] abruptdecayO_O: they should just make dungeons more rewarding as well
[5:46:13] Sowiloo: KEKL bro I was joking
[5:46:17] realandtruephobe: You are also getting way more bloods per event than most. I got 100 today in one event lol
[5:46:21] klecho123: sure but imagine a holy pala playing this event, its 100 coins every 30 minutes
[5:46:22] osopolar1977: come on
[5:46:24] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV i agree, they should nerf it but only after I have taken advantage of it /s
[5:46:27] Voidbonx: ragebaiting LUL
[5:46:29] m4honen: yeah we should get full raid gear when we hit 40 xxD
[5:46:36] Flanke77: Its been a long day its morning dude
[5:46:38] osopolar1977: ohhhhhhh
[5:46:46] TheFreedomLover: whats the objective today mr. staysafe?
[5:46:55] madgarlicjr: they prolly made it so ez cuz they know some people have alts of like every class
[5:47:04] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: as a new warlock player who's never pvp'd seriously before, any tips for this pvp event?
[5:47:14] NutterCircus: At this rate the event will be empty before people even hit 40
[5:47:16] Ryyott: but i just want to buy my BIS
[5:47:22] crunkbub: I would have liked it to take longer to get the epics from STV, but at the same time I am happy that it's over with because I had many issues with STV layering and lag.
[5:47:25] seksmuhchine: not by professional gamers tho
[5:47:28] tripledistance: eve if you pay money to progress?
[5:47:31] tripledistance: even
[5:47:39] osopolar1977: hold the door
[5:47:48] PHakeDoc: are you saying this all because you now regret grinding ab yesterday?
[5:47:54] seksmuhchine: ok streamers
[5:47:57] abruptdecayO_O: POOGERS
[5:47:58] Ryyott: participation medal
[5:48:01] Sowiloo: POGGERS
[5:48:01] osopolar1977: after I get through
[5:48:03] KrotonGG: Peggers
[5:48:11] QuestFor420: hahahaha
[5:48:14] madgarlicjr: Prayge
[5:48:16] NooleanB: Whatis the minimum wage was $100/hr?
[5:48:19] osopolar1977: true
[5:48:19] NooleanB: what if *
[5:48:25] osopolar1977: wow wow
[5:48:29] NutterCircus: Play the game for a week EleGiggle
[5:48:34] madgarlicjr: then i can play the game...of life
[5:48:36] osopolar1977: that is great
[5:48:39] HeIlraiser_: I play 12-14 hours a day but I take my time pepeLaugh
[5:48:41] Wallscast: yea they should have delayed raid a week
[5:48:42] iTeeKayy: I think wow has outlasted most MMOs so they know what they are doing guy
[5:48:46] seksmuhchine: yes no endless farms
[5:48:48] osopolar1977: ya ya
[5:49:17] lickmypetals: @StaysafeTV how many coins u get from that event
[5:49:21] Herbst_: WAIT! you are telling me BLIZZARD is slowing down progression on purpose, so people dont quit after a week?
[5:49:22] osopolar1977: back to hardcore I guess for you guys
[5:49:28] Bennska: Yes but slow gear progression leads to one-shotting people who didnt grind as much
[5:49:39] Bennska: 2k crit shadow word death btw
[5:49:39] realandtruephobe: Some people only make 100-200 coins per event.
[5:49:45] steevwtf: why are WoW players so fucking slow and uncoordinated, coming from new world pvp this is a massive downgrade
[5:49:46] fuguelah: longs grinds are fine as long it's fun or engaging
[5:49:48] TehKiller302: TehKiller302 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! sup dude
[5:49:50] seksmuhchine: uhhh
[5:50:10] dave3ooo: oof
[5:50:10] theori93: getting one guy'd
[5:50:12] osopolar1977: here we go
[5:50:13] boxing_fan: channel points on twitch should be able to be spent on an ad skip imo. just set the point value high.
[5:50:16] madgarlicjr: i stopped both my toons at 29 for a while to do some twinking in wsg =)
[5:50:21] dave3ooo: pulling the ELL card
[5:50:21] QuestFor420: dumbass is my first language
[5:50:28] mrmangasm: chat at 0243 Hours KEKW
[5:50:29] NutterCircus: RIPBOZO
[5:50:29] dave3ooo: HE GONE
[5:50:33] Voidbonx: o7
[5:50:34] madgarlicjr: FFS
[5:50:37] Sohsuh: HAVE A NICE ONE
[5:50:37] Emmune: cya
[5:50:38] osopolar1977: me from island
[5:50:38] Aeycka__: @steevwtf we're probably older than the average New World player xD
[5:50:39] KrotonGG: o7
[5:50:41] MFpatrix: bye
[5:50:43] Sowiloo: RIPBOZO
[5:50:43] seksmuhchine: ripbozo
[5:50:44] cjadude: o7
[5:50:44] Hakios: salt
[5:50:45] plebTV: @StaysafeTV they should make it insta exalted w/ 1 bronze blood coin monkaHmm
[5:50:47] thoughtcriminal: love it, masculinity
[5:50:51] codegeekman: what meta build are you? destro or demo?
[5:50:51] osopolar1977: ohhhhh
[5:50:56] e4empty: Oft big yeetus mcfarlane
[5:51:02] osopolar1977: ya what is that
[5:51:14] Jessrabbit1: lol
[5:51:17] MrSchneetzel: bcs then its over lol
[5:51:19] madgarlicjr: one million POG
[5:51:19] gitzw: prob only works til revered like ashenvale did for wsg 󠀀
[5:51:22] Robbtuck: non native engrish speakers sstvWAT
[5:51:25] johncrouton44: where do you get lumber?
[5:51:26] RiverK1ngPoker: I am a wow fan but I am just ready for a new equally good mmorpg to hit the scene
[5:51:28] KrotonGG: I want 500 per lumber
[5:51:28] obee0: whats the current rep per lumber?
[5:51:29] MrSchneetzel: 200 its isnt just over
[5:51:32] benzeno_twitch: because its too little
[5:51:33] realandtruephobe: It would be too easy, unlike it is currently....
[5:51:34] Bennska: @codegeekman anyone who goes demo has soul link, soul link apears as a buff for demo players
[5:51:39] dammitcyrus: cause blizzard wants us to slave away and play they game
[5:51:39] osopolar1977: exactly
[5:51:43] Jessrabbit1: then why not 0.0000000001 rep per lumber ???
[5:51:49] ouncefps: question, what does the rep give u access to?
[5:51:49] osopolar1977: why not Elon musk
[5:51:51] Fuxtic_Actual: its pretty similar to teh minimum wage arguemnt. just make minimum wage 1 million dollars then everyone is a millionare Kappa
[5:51:51] Asehlol: why not gives 0?
[5:51:52] spicykurii: Because most of the playerbase is so dogwater that they are not even get 200 blood per event home slice
[5:51:55] ryufromstreets6: the wheels are starting to spin in those heads
[5:51:58] a3surd: I think the real question is how much of a grind do the devs actually want
[5:52:04] Raym9nd: yes, but what's too fast? very subjective
[5:52:06] realandtruephobe: @Jessrabbit1 lol exactly. Same thing
[5:52:09] a3surd: u got a TON of blood, most people wont get that muchn
[5:52:12] RiverK1ngPoker: only if that is the only reason that people continue to play
[5:52:16] Aeycka__: Just log into retail. The first 10 levels do not feel like an achievement at all -> you get them in ~30 minutes by watching cut scenes 💩 Excellent example of not getting that feeling of achievement.
[5:52:18] dammitcyrus: there is also a thing called too slow
[5:52:19] MrSchneetzel: i mean imo i think 200 is fair but thats me
[5:52:19] res15t: Not bad for alts though
[5:52:19] osopolar1977: true
[5:52:19] seksmuhchine: isnt't that lvling?
[5:52:19] tripledistance: yes they have to sub for an extra month?
[5:52:20] linkitcraig: got friendly after 2 events lol
[5:52:23] ryufromstreets6: @Jessrabbit1 because there is such a thing as too slow, as well
[5:52:25] ouncefps: what does that rep give u?
[5:52:26] banguwu: this makes ab a laughable waste of time
[5:52:36] seksmuhchine: a reward later
[5:52:38] mysteriousm4n: brbbrbrbrb HUH
[5:52:38] KrotonGG: Peggers
[5:52:40] Arcsilin: bro sod is supposed to be casual friendly most ppl play maybe 8 hrs a week and theyd quit if they have to play 40 a week to get rewards any so either way u spin it they quit
[5:52:41] osopolar1977: you guys know all the secrets
[5:52:47] EmanuShow: Why dont they just give more different rewards?
[5:52:47] seksmuhchine: buy grinding
[5:52:48] realandtruephobe: I got 100 coins last event TRYING
[5:52:53] realandtruephobe: in a 5 man
[5:52:54] mysteriousm4n: false, avg gets 500
[5:52:56] speedzombie: def not
[5:52:57] crunkbub: I don't think that's accurate
[5:52:59] osopolar1977: huha
[5:53:03] bigspiclas: not try'
[5:53:03] osopolar1977: kekw
[5:53:05] MrSchneetzel: 800 is a lot bro
[5:53:05] killcomputer: im just came in did they change the rep you get ? or peopel saying they should?
[5:53:06] crunkbub: as someone who has all the pvp epics
[5:53:07] bigspiclas: trrue
[5:53:10] spicykurii: you are not getting close to 800 per event for a lukewarm group lmfao
[5:53:11] divadnothsa: My ave is 400 no blood god
[5:53:13] crunkbub: 800 is hard
[5:53:15] linkitcraig: even for arguement sake, do 500
[5:53:15] res15t: 3-500
[5:53:15] Herbst_: what if you only get 300?
[5:53:15] capybaras17: ive never gotten 800 :(
[5:53:15] FeverxDream_: i only got 350 ):
[5:53:16] crunkbub: mr streamer
[5:53:16] madgarlicjr: lol
[5:53:16] speedzombie: its like 400
[5:53:18] codegeekman: 500 is average
[5:53:19] lickmypetals: 800 is way to much average
[5:53:23] lickmypetals: 400-500 is average
[5:53:23] Metzxy: without a blood god most ppl get 4-500
[5:53:23] plebTV: you only get 130 rep total for winning an AB
[5:53:24] MrSchneetzel: i hear u in discord calls playing this shit
[5:53:25] TesservcT: just gotta play as a team
[5:53:27] osopolar1977: $
[5:53:27] Arcsilin: most ppl who play are retarded yes it is
[5:53:30] dammitcyrus: well lets be real Ashenvale gave a lot more per event no?
[5:53:31] spicykurii: My brother, people cant even clear the 3rd boss is gnomergon
[5:53:34] osopolar1977: &&
[5:53:34] unresolvedbroccoli: 500 is too
[5:53:34] plebTV: so 200 for this event is pretty ridiculous
[5:53:37] MrSchneetzel: lolol
[5:53:39] electric_f33l: KEKW
[5:53:40] johncrouton44: 50 silver for mount :o
[5:53:41] osopolar1977: 😅
[5:53:42] Robbtuck: if you aren’t getting at least 1k then you’re a noob
[5:53:42] xUrmia: LMAO
[5:53:43] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV play a 5man with no heals next time and see how many coins you get
[5:53:44] madgarlicjr: BASEDHALT
[5:53:44] cjadude: lmfao
[5:53:47] osopolar1977: wooo wooo
[5:53:49] mrmangasm: yeah chat is being dumb, move on KEKW
[5:53:50] MrSchneetzel: we beat him guys
[5:53:51] dave3ooo: pls no trigger mr stremmer man
[5:53:52] Warriorfall: dude ur a silly billy
[5:53:54] ScarfaceCEO: 500! You would have to be elite to get that! Kappa
[5:53:56] FrozenScone: i only made 300-400 last 2 times
[5:54:00] Hakios: jesus this stream xd
[5:54:02] Jessrabbit1: man who only plays wow thinks it's too fast
[5:54:02] osopolar1977: duDudu duDudu wooo
[5:54:07] KrotonGG: Did they add more rep items on second page?
[5:54:09] dammitcyrus: you click on the copper to make silver
[5:54:10] Flanke77: nah we just woke up
[5:54:11] dammitcyrus: KEKW
[5:54:11] benzeno_twitch: BASEDRETARD
[5:54:18] thatquidproquo: @FrozenScone Same only made about 400 in a shit 5man pug
[5:54:21] MrSchneetzel: this is the best chat on twitch
[5:54:24] Metzxy: just calculate with 500 avg if ppl insist on it, and show them the truth of the math B)
[5:54:26] Arcsilin: KEKW
[5:54:26] Voidbonx: ICANT
[5:54:28] EmanuShow: Why you think we trolling? Kapp
[5:54:30] Herbst_: how long will it take if i get 32 coind per event @StaysafeTV ?
[5:54:30] ANGEL_7_17_1972: In a couple of weeks when all these ppl are crying there is nothing to do then you can say TOLD YA SO
[5:54:30] unresolvedbroccoli: 400 is the norm
[5:54:32] madgarlicjr: im playing gtaOnline right now peepoComfy
[5:54:38] dammitcyrus: so how much is a turnin?
[5:54:38] MrUntold: put them on your 1 key and keep pressing
[5:54:45] osopolar1977: here we goo duDudu
[5:54:48] crunkbub: Everytime I did STV today and yesterday I couldn't get on the same layer as my group. And these layering issues are pretty common. I only got about 100-200 coins because I was playing solo basically.
[5:54:57] dammitcyrus: SoD is for alts tbh
[5:54:59] Arcsilin: then ill play an alt
[5:55:00] pitbullcgn87: level an ALT :D
[5:55:00] realandtruephobe: I can pretty much guarentee you I won't be exalted with AB anytime soon
[5:55:05] Asehlol: Yeah but why it gives arathi rep at least ashenvale made sense
[5:55:10] hildedank: well 3/4 of us dont play 12 hours a day
[5:55:10] plebTV: think about it like this, if this is better rep than AB, what is the point of AB? the event should provide a secondary avenue towards gaining rep and usually alternative routes of gaining rep do not provide better rep than the main route
[5:55:11] mrmangasm: two and a half or three months is going to be way too long
[5:55:14] tripledistance: queue for fun?
[5:55:18] thatquidproquo: true
[5:55:19] xUrmia: as the gm of the #1 horde guild world, we require everyone have 4 alts and exalted all factions. So it really helps us.
[5:55:20] mrmangasm: even just 1% KEKW
[5:55:22] linkitcraig: or 70% in STV
[5:55:23] AntarcticTreaty: 69%
[5:55:23] MrSchneetzel: i get 500 coins max so 1k rep seems p fair since i can only do the event twice a day
[5:55:27] Arcsilin: yeah the mount is dumb af
[5:55:30] dammitcyrus: the mount should be able to be 100% when 60
[5:55:37] linkitcraig: everywhere? or just STV
[5:55:38] cyonara74: im 6k into revered with wsg.  i will one day reach exalted but im never joining a bg
[5:55:38] tripledistance: lol play to win??? no thanks
[5:55:46] Arcsilin: its not special in any way
[5:55:48] EmanuShow: Ye thats my point, give more different rewards
[5:55:55] osopolar1977: Getcamped
[5:55:56] Arcsilin: since everyone can get it
[5:56:20] Metzxy: wanna hear my story? im getting 1100 coins per game, and ive been 40 for 1+ week but cant afford mount and dont wanna quest or buy gold, and so im running around without mount until i get this mount. currently i have 75 coins
[5:56:43] Metzxy: cuz this mount is free xD
[5:56:44] NutterCircus: YEP
[5:56:45] QuestFor420: yep
[5:56:45] mrmangasm: agree
[5:56:46] osopolar1977: kek
[5:56:49] EmanuShow: Like you cant by any amount of time not get every reward but that you had to choose
[5:56:49] Voidbonx: yeah i HATE those idiots
[5:56:51] tripledistance: why would you want a game to be play to win?
[5:56:58] mrmangasm: like a kid eating candy
[5:57:00] Warriorfall: dude i love u but you are autistically repeating urself every single human in chat understands fully
[5:57:01] kheap_: there is kinda a fine line
[5:57:06] Voidbonx: and then they go back to fifa
[5:57:06] Arcsilin: either way ppl will quit too hard too easy
[5:57:09] plebTV: it also drives the neckbeard playerbase away so it dilutes the talent level of the game
[5:57:10] osopolar1977: I like when everyone gets acidic
[5:57:13] NutterCircus: Same kind of people that leave dungeon groups on first wipe.
[5:57:15] Valthasar: I GOTTA CONSUME AND MOVE ON TO NEXT GAME TO CONSUME Stare 🚬
[5:57:18] linkitcraig: 500 blood = 1k rep = 42 events friendly to exalted (5 1/2 days)
[5:57:18] Vespyyr: quinMaoPls Tssk
[5:57:19] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV can we talk about how stupid it is they put in the bijou effect where you have to slowly convert the coins
[5:57:20] madgarlicjr: play to win KEKL
[5:57:20] mrmangasm: you got to read the room before you try and goof around
[5:57:20] MrSchneetzel: wheres the line between too grindy and too casual??
[5:57:21] Yung_Tamagucci: PLEASE BAN ME
[5:57:25] linkitcraig: neutral to exalted*
[5:57:26] MawblesPDX: hi
[5:57:29] tripledistance: ok ill be good
[5:57:37] TesservcT: STVietnam PTSD
[5:57:37] EmanuShow: Blood for the bloodgod :D
[5:57:46] osopolar1977: oohhh
[5:57:47] Hakios: First time I joined this stream and I wouldn't mind getting banned what the fuck is this toxicity
[5:57:50] mysteriousm4n: @linkitcraig is that assuming 24/7?
[5:57:51] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV 250 honor for 25 copper coins is a good deal
[5:57:57] linkitcraig: @mysteriousm4n yeah
[5:58:00] killcomputer: @linkitcraig that most of the phase
[5:58:03] SgtBrownBeard: @mrschneetzel in the eyes of the beholder
[5:58:06] osopolar1977: he’s emmersioned
[5:58:06] Arcsilin: @Hakios u heard him ban him
[5:58:11] EmanuShow: Air is toxic
[5:58:19] Metzxy: my opinion on this:  - do some things casual friendly, so u get "decent" gear or whatever - do some things non casual friendly, so the people who play this game incessantly have something to do and can feel cool when they acquire something other people don't have
[5:58:33] Metzxy: just mix it up
[5:58:37] TheWhiteRabbitxX: it’s funny because that’s the whole reason they staggered the levels because people are losers and have no life. ppl would get 60 in a week and the sod would be doa
[5:58:40] linkitcraig: hammerfall
[5:58:41] Bennska: But they are not catering to casuals, they basically told everyone who is not a priest to start over at lvl1, since that is the only way to win in pvp :)
[5:58:42] Rhobarr: arathi
[5:58:42] antimondez: WSG/AB rep grinds not fun in classic. AV is the only one that's enjoyable when everyone is on board for the first 2 months its out.
[5:58:42] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV go to hammerfall
[5:58:43] mysteriousm4n: KEKW
[5:58:44] Robbtuck: @tesservct whoa your name is the name of subtronics new album
[5:58:44] Rhobarr: yes

[5:58:49] iiMrBlue: arathi highlands
[5:58:50] Lunights: yeah arathi
[5:58:56] Metaphix: stop the count
[5:58:57] Rhobarr: u can turn more than 1?
[5:58:57] mysteriousm4n: 20 minute flight ResidentSleeper
[5:58:59] TesservcT: @Robbtuck BatChest
[5:59:01] madgarlicjr: clean up on isle 40 MLADY ModTime
[5:59:04] cyonara74: mage port to uc
[5:59:07] osopolar1977: ez
[5:59:18] plebTV: WAIT, u said PAUSE but didnt say PLAY..im still paused monkaHmm
[5:59:19] divadnothsa: You had the blood god
[5:59:31] tecncaldificltes: can you go all the way to exalted with lumber turn ins ?
[5:59:36] Metaphix: UR UNDEAD
[5:59:37] linkitcraig: 1k blood = 2k rep , neutral to exalted is 42k rep = 21 events = 2.5  days
[5:59:38] divadnothsa: Most people get like 2k from the event
[5:59:41] klecho123: 90 minutes or ~ 10 hours
[5:59:41] cyonara74: fail mage
[5:59:43] 99deece: compare it to the ashenvale event, not that crazy
[5:59:49] Herbst_: LUL
[5:59:50] osopolar1977: he don’t
[5:59:51] madgarlicjr: he makes a point
[5:59:56] Herbst_: he is close!
[5:59:57] endraga1: you could do the samew thing hes doing ints not that hard to m,ake a 5 man team
[5:59:59] EmanuShow: LUL
[6:00:01] osopolar1977: kek omg
[6:00:01] TesservcT: fighting on blood god is juiced
[6:00:03] Henry_Ash: chat is pepega today
[6:00:08] osopolar1977: fail mage
[6:00:08] realandtruephobe: In my opinion, I think you are overestimating how many coins most people will get per run
[6:00:09] mrmangasm: can you make raids for the bloodmoon, or just five man parties?
[6:00:13] linkitcraig: they should cap it to revered
[6:00:17] NutterCircus: The Meta for STV Event is to find the blood god.
[6:00:21] linkitcraig: like ashenvale
[6:00:23] klecho123: i followed! <3
[6:00:25] Herbst_: one more stupid chat message and we all die!!!!!!!!!!
[6:00:27] ScarfaceCEO: Actually best stream on the internet.
[6:00:43] crunkbub: I have personally had terrible luck with layering and lag in STV, so I don't get many coins but still got my epics and now I raid log.
[6:01:01] KokaneKaviar: hi poopheads
[6:01:08] bonemagus: Yeah, I follow and you want to nerf my rep farm. I play this event once in 1-2 days and get 5-8 silver. Thx
[6:01:40] madgarlicjr: LOLW
[6:01:46] mrmangasm: yep

[6:02:00] Voidbonx: finally you get it!
[6:02:00] osopolar1977: ya see
[6:02:04] Metaphix: every resource node gives 10k resource
[6:02:04] andypandynz: sod is retail 2.0, they make qol changes weekly to make everything easier and more accessible. only diff is sod is 1 year long so it wont compound
[6:02:06] pitbullcgn87: lol :D
[6:02:12] madgarlicjr: just give us the final lvl 60 raid now
[6:02:13] qtceef: perma ban the strimer, he wilding to much
[6:02:19] siilver40: free lvl 40 aswell
[6:02:21] NutterCircus: Win the game just logging in EleGiggle
[6:02:22] dibadibb: PogU
[6:02:23] Bennska: They should implement the wow tokenns at least
[6:02:25] mrmangasm: its easy to see how retail became so terrible
[6:02:25] steevwtf: just let me parse against the braindeads so i can prove im better/smarter, ezclap
[6:02:26] dibadibb: yess pls
[6:02:27] Voidbonx: include mount and level boost
[6:02:28] a3surd: not free 40
[6:02:29] Deathkleenex: high warlord for everyone
[6:02:31] FrozenScone: where my lvl 40 boost
[6:02:31] tsetse2fly: SPEED IT SPEEED IT
[6:02:32] dryhops_: pay to win!!
[6:02:33] a3surd: BUT paid level 40
[6:02:34] EmanuShow: Lets get on the speed wagon
[6:02:34] unresolvedbroccoli: free professions just pick 2 max lvl
[6:02:42] osopolar1977: hmmm
[6:02:46] bonemagus: Bro you insane. You play a lot and know a lot. But for me I first time playing wow and discovering is fun
[6:02:46] seksmuhchine: i had a good sandwich just now
[6:02:51] Ahnzh: good morning.
[6:02:51] Metaphix: until SOD 2, Outlands boogaloo
[6:02:58] unresolvedbroccoli: free healthcare too
[6:03:02] EmanuShow: Speed is a great suppliment :D
[6:03:09] seksmuhchine: i'm a sandwichest
[6:03:11] osopolar1977: well hmmm
[6:03:14] bittam: first weekly should give more and after that lumber give less rep
[6:03:18] Muaytitus: im loving sod, feels nothing like retail
[6:03:19] RudyRube: @StaysafeTV flying mounts are the #1 thing that makes retail retail imo, if picking one thing
[6:03:30] mrmangasm: objective of SoD is to make Classic Era Wow as fun as possible
[6:03:34] RudyRube: totally changes the game
[6:03:43] mrmangasm: yes
[6:03:51] EmanuShow: SOD is closest thing to wow2 you get^^
[6:04:04] madgarlicjr: mounts
[6:04:05] backattack_01: what happens to my SOD charakter after the season is over?
[6:04:05] dave3ooo: i mean
[6:04:06] linkitcraig: LFG
[6:04:07] burritofritter: LFR
[6:04:07] backlundninetythree: stupid overdone
[6:04:09] klecho123: speed
[6:04:11] dave3ooo: sod is retail, yo be real with you
[6:04:11] Jessrabbit1: no class identity
[6:04:12] Myclol: mega cross servers
[6:04:14] AxelFromAustralia: wow token
[6:04:15] steevwtf: its means 20 different buttons to hit and everyone does the same thing
[6:04:17] AxelFromAustralia: lfg
[6:04:18] Bennska: Achievements
[6:04:20] klecho123: easy dopamine
[6:04:24] helloiamlucas: wow token
[6:04:27] backlundninetythree: nonstop grinding
[6:04:28] mrmangasm: sharding?
[6:04:32] Rhobarr: retail = no social interaction
[6:04:34] AntarcticTreaty: Kevin Jordan was always against flying mounts, but the superiors didn’t listen
[6:04:38] dave3ooo: but they're referring to modern wow when they say retail, i think
[6:04:38] osopolar1977: OSFrog
[6:04:44] lerler: i think phasing is so trash
[6:04:48] Arathionn: adhd mechanics probably. 100 things have to be happening at once to keep the player engaged KEKW
[6:04:49] mrmangasm: oh
[6:04:51] N_Tys: sharding is horrible too. it killed world pvp
[6:04:55] glenncloseisaman: new content instead of replaying 10 year old content, obviously
[6:04:55] seksmuhchine: pepperocinis
[6:04:58] madgarlicjr: saved HYPERS
[6:05:00] andypandynz: QOL changes to make the game easier and more accessible and losing prestige. that is sod and sod would turn into retail if sod was 5+ years
[6:05:00] mrmangasm: yes
[6:05:01] Voidbonx: YEP
[6:05:04] osopolar1977: KomodoHype
[6:05:06] linkitcraig: started in wrath
[6:05:10] cjadude: oh yeah
[6:05:11] osopolar1977: duDudu duDudu NotLikeThis
[6:05:21] gaming5150: What is a shart?
[6:05:26] ninobambinow: Have a good night stay safe that was fun
[6:05:33] seksmuhchine: tomatoes
[6:05:39] glenncloseisaman: Biden sharted himself recently
[6:05:40] klecho123: Retail isn't as much a MMO anymore as it is a lobby for instanced content
[6:05:43] Metaphix: only gets weird when you see a flower and waanna pick it then you run to it and poof gone lol
[6:05:51] burritofritter: WRATH
[6:05:52] Ahnzh: WOTLK
[6:06:00] Ahnzh: started in icecrown
[6:06:05] Ahnzh: if i remember correctly
[6:06:09] madgarlicjr: wow got turned into a console game
[6:06:14] AxelFromAustralia: will you play Cata
[6:06:15] osopolar1977: just like Biden
[6:06:18] mrmangasm: 100%
[6:06:26] ScarfaceCEO: Phasing is jarring
[6:06:28] KGWay: sharting
[6:06:34] killcomputer: really never had problems with sharding, never really notice it
[6:06:35] unresolvedbroccoli: sharding pretty intrusive to my pants
[6:06:42] osopolar1977: blap
[6:06:55] Metaphix: i smirk every time you say sharding im literally 9
[6:07:07] osopolar1977: I’m in the dimensions bro
[6:07:13] linkitcraig: friendly with AB and never been in an AB, feelsgood
[6:07:16] mrmangasm: I do think a big issue with layering is in or around combat, and issues with parties members getting separated
[6:07:18] Utmost777: also, sharding in retail can be cross server
[6:07:25] saltyseadoggg: I just sharted myself
[6:07:38] Arcsilin: that happens in SoD
[6:07:39] gaming5150: WAYTOODANK
[6:07:40] lastdeviljoker666: same
[6:07:40] osopolar1977: feel it first
[6:07:41] therealrickdiculous: ironman character right? XD
[6:07:48] klecho123: would a game without sharding and layers be possible?
[6:07:52] crunkbub: that happens to me all the time in STV with layering. People disappear mid kill, same with my group lol.
[6:07:54] killcomputer: that has only happened to me with World bosses , which is a pain
[6:07:57] tecncaldificltes: that happens in SoD
[6:08:05] Ahnzh: the quest state thing is horrible, when looking for groups to do elite quests in wotlk.
[6:08:05] siilver40: or you see the mob you need and you fly too it and it layers out
[6:08:05] osopolar1977: ya so rude
[6:08:11] unresolvedbroccoli: happens in sod too
[6:08:18] klecho123: no i mean like capless
[6:08:23] klecho123: one world
[6:08:38] therealrickdiculous: if only
[6:08:38] dave3ooo: not possible, champ
[6:08:45] dave3ooo: si
[6:08:47] KrotonGG: Kappa less
[6:08:48] osopolar1977: 2024 still can’t have mmo
[6:08:58] todddiff: flushE
[6:08:58] unresolvedbroccoli: to save money on less servers
[6:09:09] dave3ooo: imagine the literally gamebreak off 9000 people all in the same org
[6:09:09] Metaphix: perspective Pog
[6:09:12] siilver40: nice box
[6:09:13] todddiff: PogU dream
[6:09:13] dave3ooo: no layer
[6:09:15] dave3ooo: no nothing
[6:09:16] dave3ooo: lmao
[6:09:18] osopolar1977: your a layer
[6:09:22] KrotonGG: nice box bro
[6:09:26] andypandynz: @unresolvedbroccoli no game can do it so that makes no sense
[6:09:38] todddiff: bttvNice
[6:09:39] andypandynz: @unresolvedbroccoli wrong person
[6:09:44] osopolar1977: imagine a pigeon box
[6:09:48] cyonara74: parallel dimensions
[6:09:51] MawblesPDX: DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS MANNN
[6:09:54] madgarlicjr: reminds me of those mini cake bites Mmmm
[6:09:59] osopolar1977: oh man
[6:10:05] TesservcT: if you hold shift the line should draw straight
[6:10:10] osopolar1977: I had this dream
[6:10:10] cyonara74: sliders
[6:10:12] truffle_shuffler: i think at this point having your toons server locked is kinda odd, imagine if on runescape you could only play on one world.
[6:10:12] exz_96: bro said callimdoor
[6:10:13] todddiff: :tf:
[6:10:15] klecho123: maybe the concept of a server needs to be changed, we're still  thinking in the box
[6:10:24] todddiff: DarkKnight
[6:10:36] Fuxtic_Actual: which one is the Asmon layer?
[6:10:38] madgarlicjr: come to my layer bro for some netflix and chill
[6:10:40] osopolar1977: holla holla
[6:10:43] Fuxtic_Actual: can i be on that one?
[6:10:48] todddiff: bttvNice polska gurom
[6:10:59] Brendon0769: It kind of makes the world empty still
[6:11:06] Sasza_Cwierclitrow: fascinating !!!
[6:11:10] bonemagus: It's help sometimes to avoid gankers. I like it
[6:11:18] andypandynz: im pretty sure its a tech limit LUL even new mmos cantdo it
[6:11:23] klecho123: ye its a tech bottleneck
[6:11:28] todddiff: NODDERS
[6:11:37] Myclol: it build server community tho
[6:11:38] backattack_01: time for new tech yea
[6:11:39] linkitcraig: gw2 does it well, u can 'guest' on any server
[6:11:41] AxelFromAustralia: retail you can play with any server in your region
[6:11:42] cyonara74: sod crossrealm?
[6:11:42] Sasza_Cwierclitrow: @todddiff  :D u r right
[6:11:43] orrangejuiced: that is how guildwars 2 is
[6:11:43] sydale: Make it like RuneScape worlds
[6:11:44] zanriah: ESO does it like that
[6:11:48] RudyRube: @StaysafeTV they almost got it down to megaservers on SoD, if you account for regions/pvp/pve type
[6:11:49] ConstantlySean: ping tho
[6:11:49] mrmangasm: yep
[6:11:50] Anonymalous: Anonymalous subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[6:11:52] unresolvedbroccoli: that would cost an absolute fortune to run for blizz
[6:11:53] windatar: Isnt that essentially what crusader strike is?
[6:11:55] crunkbub: Not all games are like that though, many games can do cross server things.
[6:11:56] killcomputer: Sever are barely a thing in retail, it pretty much is a mega sever
[6:11:57] HugzGG: yeah my stv's would love that
[6:12:02] tex_oce: but then blizz cant make money out of realm xfers
[6:12:03] windatar: Crusdarer strike is like 1 million players.
[6:12:30] TakiitoPotato: 2 servers NA and EU
[6:12:30] todddiff: ABDULpls ☦️
[6:12:34] mohihe3834: cool mount kid
[6:12:41] Shaticus: @windatar is there no player cap, just faction cap??
[6:12:50] todddiff: @TakiitoPotato what about AU :(
[6:12:52] denflup: whats the server cap?
[6:13:05] backlundninetythree: that would actually be sweet
[6:13:06] Shaticus: whats ur opinion on pvp damage? @StaysafeTV
[6:13:08] andypandynz: @windatar whered u get that info
[6:13:09] endraga1: i love how balanced the factions are too
[6:13:14] endraga1: hate being the only faction
[6:13:15] windatar: Yeah aggrend has said the only cap is the faction cap. If there is more horde then alliance opens up, if there is more alliance then  horde opens up.
[6:13:17] Arathionn: What do you think the pitfalls would be of a server like that?
[6:13:17] backlundninetythree: what if they made 3 factions
[6:13:29] crunkbub: way too bursty
[6:13:30] todddiff: NOP
[6:13:31] TakiitoPotato: ESO does it NA and EU and the aussies plays on NA
[6:13:31] bonemagus: Good for auction and economy overall I think
[6:13:35] RudyRube: im a rogue, its FINE
[6:13:36] crunkbub: but also depends on the class
[6:13:40] tex_oce: its terrible
[6:13:49] ConstantlySean: spriest
[6:13:50] Tesla369: hunter next
[6:13:52] mikey0105: if casters didn't have push back
[6:13:52] yung_jed: chat what addon he got that shows targets HP
[6:13:55] mikey0105: it wouldnt feel so bad
[6:13:56] craboskai: nerf warlocks for sure
[6:13:57] Gilwing: rogue?
[6:13:58] tecncaldificltes: they nerfed spriest  ? WHEN ?
[6:14:02] sammixi: buff warlocks :)
[6:14:05] todddiff: @TakiitoPotato AU doesn’t connect on most NA Server
[6:14:08] TehKiller302: Can't wait to see how bad it gets at 60
[6:14:10] EmanuShow: PvP never really gets balanced
[6:14:10] MFpatrix: Sometimes I wonder what QA in blizz are doing
[6:14:13] Arcsilin: eh hunter is ok cuz they gotta close the gap
[6:14:17] therealrickdiculous: getting hit for 1000 by melee hunters and paladins
[6:14:28] thatquidproquo: POGSLIDE POGSLIDE POGSLIDE
[6:14:36] windatar: There is only like 6/8 SoD serveres, but the numbers from logs and population shows that Sod is essentially the same as retail or close to from their previous blue posts.
[6:14:36] scyllynn: is the lumber back in the game?
[6:14:36] Voidbonx: POGSLIDE POGSLIDE POGSLIDE
[6:14:36] todddiff: POGSLIDE
[6:14:37] osopolar1977: get rekt
[6:14:42] MawblesPDX: how much rep is each turn in @StaysafeTV ?
[6:14:47] windatar: I aint pulling links, people can research themselves.
[6:14:49] RudyRube: @Arcsilin yeah also a lot of them arent used to melee so u can get behind them really easy xD
[6:14:56] andypandynz: @windatar nah thats the biggest amount of cope
[6:15:07] linkitcraig: how long did it take you to get honored?
[6:15:21] windatar: @andypandynz Sure, your welcome to believe what you want. Lol, I aint going to try an convince you.
[6:15:25] Rhobarr: does it cap at revered?
[6:15:37] tex_oce: hows the boomy levelling (just joined chat)
[6:15:40] trashcanman3: @StaysafeTV What do you think about what happened in Kansas City? Thank God they have one of the best Children's hospitals in the world only a mile away.
[6:15:40] andypandynz: @windatar i think u forgot blizz hasnt releasednumbers for 10 years lil bro
[6:15:42] Shaticus: @andypandynz i dont get it. is he saying its dead??
[6:15:43] siilver40: What rep is it for?
[6:15:45] todddiff: @Sasza_Cwierclitrow :) mój polski przyjaciel
[6:15:55] thatquidproquo: huge
[6:16:03] klecho123: they could limit to 5 logs a day
[6:16:05] abruptdecayO_O: ab rep is notoriously grindy tho although i do agree with ur non content take
[6:16:07] mrmangasm: I think a fair point to make is the average player does not get that many coins
[6:16:13] Alpentalic: what build are you rocking in pvp?
[6:16:16] crunkbub: It's not really 90 minutes though, you have to wait 3 hours between each event. But still too much yeah.
[6:16:20] backattack_01: how is resto druid in sod?
[6:16:20] Shaticus: whats that rep for, what does it give u @StaysafeTV

[6:28:59] linkitcraig: he's gonna say it won't work the day before p3 and then it'll work
[6:29:01] the_bhagwan: also if that was the case then you would save them for 50-60 surely. lmao good logic
