[1:34:55] TomCat: something about the wording of the 'save the date' blue post led me to believe 9.2.5 and s4 could be separate and maybe a 9.3

[1:35:41] Thunderbrew: @Jarwerewolf Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:35:45] Jessethoth: Can't rush polish.
[1:35:59] jaina8675309: ok cool

[1:38:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cross-faction next week!!
[1:38:48] mandilozano: kyrian dks LUL

[1:43:10] Yagr6: boosters
[1:43:12] PvtHudson093: you could do a dance off in Algalon's room
[1:43:23] Zeke_nl: do we know if you can trade cross faction? like trade gold between ally and horde?

[1:44:18] Frostfury: It's a miracle tho since my guild I am running struggling for recruitment for Mythic. I am happy we got crossrealm early as possible
[1:44:43] lithium364: they should punish the faction not getting hall of fame filled :kappa blocked from the next raid Kappa
[1:44:59] FrankTizzle: I think its Hall of Fame going forward
[1:45:02] subversv: make it top 200 now then
[1:45:03] Artivicii: true
[1:45:05] FrankTizzle: Top 100 both sides
[1:45:07] Kisswani: maybe to preserve guild importance for Mythic raiding , but that doesn't require HoF
[1:45:07] mavericks312: so 95 horde 5 alliance lol
[1:45:13] dergNwolf: pretty sure that's gonna be how it is from now on

[1:46:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it makes sense to spam Torghast 9 for quick renown
[1:46:37] reggiepowa: renown after 60 is pretty cosmetic anyway
[1:46:48] ventu105: no more Thorgast plz @Towelliee
[1:47:23] dergNwolf: maybe that'll be in the season 4 9.2.7 KEKW

[2:23:14] Gargantix: @bcrosala cross faction instanced play
[2:23:20] 91Niki: Maybe the healer is just bored and wants to explosives to go off LUL
[2:23:22] Jessethoth: @bcrosala Not terribly huge amounts of story, some minor questlines that could be setting things up.
[2:23:22] Artivicii: Your dps is low from user error not the explosives
[2:23:23] ThatGuyFayde: @mrniceguy817 no its not lo, if your in a pug who dont follow mechanics than thats`s a bit silly
[2:23:28] Jessethoth: @bcrosala Massive system stuff though.
[2:23:40] warrenny: @towelliee educating?
[2:23:42] DisparagingTurtle: Healer is like "i aint touching that shit either" KEKW
[2:23:45] Clicklesly: Healer is letting them pop off so they have something to do Kappa
[2:23:57] Jessethoth: @bcrosala It's been described as a "Greatest Hits" patch with every raid from Shadowlands brought up to current.
[2:24:17] Gargantix: @Towelliee will timewalking dungeons be cross faction?
[2:24:27] DisparagingTurtle: Fire mage doing a whole 300k sustain KEKW
[2:24:29] Jessethoth: @bcrosala So like Castle Nathria and Sanctum of Domination would be on par with Sepulcher of the First Ones. Stuff like that.
[2:24:32] raye_gaming22: that fucker is even a resto druid who can moonfire it
[2:24:45] Jessethoth: @Gargantix Oooo good question, I hope so.
[2:24:50] Artivicii: LOL
[2:25:14] bigb0ngrip: Fire mage ain't it for pve lol
[2:25:19] mrniceguy817: Damn that mage is pumpin
[2:25:27] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Funny you mention that, I'm DPSing while healing right now.
[2:25:33] Thoreya: @bigb0ngrip fire is better than frost rn
[2:25:34] 91Niki: Like 1 moon fire LUL
[2:25:38] Jessethoth: Was wondering the same thing.
[2:25:41] Alaquane: less than 1 moon fire
[2:25:43] rutari: was 67 dps, 18.7k dmg
[2:25:43] Gargantix: @Jessethoth I'm assuming it is, being s they stated Trial of the Champion is not part of cross faction instanced play? but I'm not sure if that just means you can't enter cross faction, or if it's just not listed in TW dungeons for cross faction?
[2:25:44] Mockle: probably some weird trinket procc lol
[2:25:45] BullDevil: rank 1 moonfire LUL
[2:25:46] eyewal: 1 sunfire to sprad it LUL
[2:25:49] 91Niki: Smacked the boss with his staff

[2:25:51] bigb0ngrip: @thoreya since when?
[2:25:52] raye_gaming22: 1 auto attack by mistake
[2:25:58] Jessethoth: @Towelliee And I mean, they even have procs and shit set up so you can do a mini DPS rotation during heals.
[2:26:01] Artivicii: I do like 5 moonfires in an entire dungeon
[2:26:04] kaos4666: NOT EVEN 69  Stare
[2:26:04] generaljosh721: He smacked the boss
[2:26:05] DisparagingTurtle: I try to dps when im healing but, I always end up with timmy the adhd kid who wants to pull the entire first floor of the instance
[2:26:07] Thoreya: past few weeks
[2:26:13] Deadcells: Explosives is such an easy affix to deal with but people are just too dumb or lazy to take care of it

[5:16:58] JayFil: idk last boss of hall of lightning had like 2 million player kills or something
[5:16:59] feherlofia123: thats why they ramped up the difficulty with cata heroics
[5:17:01] Fragglevision: lichking wall chase

[5:26:33] Rictamar: He's a great content creator, and commentator on the industry
[5:26:43] belfastcl: the "death of" series intends to explain why a certain game died (or is on a death trend)

[5:37:50] Broomba: how many players would have played and bought the game if it stayed in the sandbox pvp system @towelliee

[5:45:46] kokochris: ya he is knocking the business management of it

[5:47:13] thee_country_boy_gangsta: well this video is good just the narrative is just meh
[5:47:50] kodtheog: wasn't new world bad because basically they put all their time and effort into the lord of the rings mmo til it got cancelled
[5:48:03] thee_country_boy_gangsta: nothing at all...
[5:48:03] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[5:48:05] LegoCoin: yeah nothing important
[5:48:10] Sylphy_TV: zekeTHINK riiiiiiiiight

[5:48:14] CrunkyBrewster: we were chillin Kappa
[5:48:19] dimofodi: His timeline take is bad, absolutely.
[5:48:20] rymerre: yep...everything was fine HahaThisisfine HahaThisisfine HahaThisisfine
[5:48:20] kaihole: yeah wtf, just go to the office and work on it
[5:48:22] zinbers: The shocking thing is EverQuest is still Running
[5:48:25] thee_country_boy_gangsta: i do think PSO2 did come out and blessed and elyon came out but yeah
[5:48:26] Ellycat1: It was the only delayed game peepoSad
[5:48:29] LazyDynamics: tbh its basically the story of Wildstar. relatively good junior devs but leadership with no clue
[5:48:32] rbolude: LUL
[5:48:34] VrtniPatuljak: monkaW the coof
[5:48:45] Malarick: ok let me clarify it is missing repeatble content for the casual kiddies that need constant stimulation.  those that like sandbox games enjoy it.  I play a couple of times a week.
[5:48:49] YZIOHP: not sure I am on the same page with this video
[5:49:23] MILESkg21: not mentioning the king BibleThump
[5:49:24] abracka_: wow story is snooze fest compared to XIV lets be rela
[5:49:26] abracka_: real*
[5:49:30] cudlsac: well i mean shadowlands story isnt good
[5:49:31] conv3rge_: You notice he didn't say activision blizzard when he said "big players" lmao
[5:49:32] Rictamar: I mean the WoW story is pretty trash
[5:49:36] rymerre: well ESO and SWTOR have the best story experience
[5:49:53] thee_country_boy_gangsta: ESO and SWTOR do have books to base lore on
[5:49:53] warrenny: They are miles better for story content tbf
[5:49:53] Ellycat1: Seems they're intentionally avoiding WoW/blizz since it was missing from the studios earlier tho despite him having the logo in there. LuL
[5:49:57] rbolude: @Gylduran but he mentioned mmorpg endgame, not just story
[5:50:01] PoppaMetal: If he mention WoW a lot then you get the why you comparing it to a 15+ mmo bros
[5:50:06] c0mmander_starscream: The dude hates WoW becuase he was kicked from his Mythic Plus Guild
[5:50:12] PoppaMetal: year old*
[5:50:12] LegoCoin: I know when we all started playing - Most of use were saying needed 6 Months more. Now looking back I would say it needed another 1 year.
[5:50:13] Rictamar: @qzAri so he doesn't like WoW, who cares?
[5:50:15] rymerre: LOL
[5:50:31] c0mmander_starscream: So now he has a blood fued with WoW

[5:51:09] Ariea_Whisper: Who is this guy lol
[5:51:13] thee_country_boy_gangsta: boring world? the world is super alive LUL
[5:51:19] CrunkyBrewster: true
[5:51:21] Rastailian: He's trolling, and using selective facts to try and sell his opinion
[5:51:23] VrtniPatuljak: 6/10 no bribe provided
[5:51:26] Reckless_Monk: true
[5:51:26] rbolude: @Gylduran uh he is putting out an informative video about mmos, you can't just pretend a game didn't happen jsut cause u don't like it lol

[5:51:56] JackedDown: Okay nowww he's lost it
[5:51:57] LegoCoin: lol
[5:51:59] CrunkyBrewster: i think you're right
[5:52:00] Malarick: nope.  not at all
[5:52:00] cudlsac: hes clueless
[5:52:00] Velashen: Wow.. hot take
[5:52:00] CrunkyBrewster: yeah
[5:52:01] c0mmander_starscream: Super Turbo Andy
[5:52:01] kokochris: lol
[5:52:04] flebbooo: This some u think u do but u don't kinda shit KEKW
[5:52:05] Reckless_Monk: Should of played Wildstar if you wanted hardcore...
[5:52:06] PoppaMetal: hes talking about the original testers that went into the studio byu "we"
[5:52:09] Ariea_Whisper: This guy is just fir the clicks lol
[5:52:12] CrunkyBrewster: I do not want a Dark Souls MMO
[5:52:16] MILESkg21: this mufucka gone KEKW
[5:52:18] c0mmander_starscream: PUBG Tryhard
[5:52:19] kokochris: He can have an opinion, but can't say "everyone wanted"
[5:52:20] Sinvin: this guy sounds like a snob
[5:52:21] abracka_: game would have been DOA if it came out the way he wanted
[5:52:21] dimmrill: I dont think thats what he meant by Dark Souls. Probably the combat style, not the difficulty of it
[5:52:23] OceanManCarter: I'm not sure I've ever heard of "snappy combat" described as a bad thing
[5:52:30] c0mmander_starscream: PubG tryhard that uses "Aimbot"
[5:52:34] UlsterFarl: Don't like Dark Souls offline and would hate it even more online with lag
[5:52:36] CrunkyBrewster: really I want a EQ1 Pre-PoP MMO LUL
[5:52:39] Fido_Montoya: He loves old sandbox MMOs. It‚Äôs true. He hates theme park stuff
[5:52:41] PoppaMetal: @kokochris He is talking about the testers that went in initially
[5:52:50] roseclawz: sandbox simp
[5:53:27] LegoCoin: I agree they needed 6-12months more
[5:53:28] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW WORLD Exclusive 3v3 Arenas vs Devs youtu.be/Weq4sEsh3hI
[5:53:28] CrunkyBrewster: i think the only thing i agree with him on is that i just did not get into the story or world building of New World. I wasn't feeling it
[5:53:31] Malarick: we need to find out where cancelling SW Galaxies touched him.
[5:53:37] Vashile: I‚Äôm not getting that from him at all
[5:53:44] kokochris: @PoppaMetal he still cant say "they all wanted", he cant speak for each person. As you heard, tow played the early version and did not advocate for DS like combat
[5:53:48] CrunkyBrewster: ugh Dark Souls
[5:54:02] Fido_Montoya: He also doesn‚Äôt consider WoW or FFXIV to be ‚Äòmassive‚Äô as implied in MMORPG
[5:54:03] Reckless_Monk: Guides, and "How to get to the end game fast" screwed the development on new updates shorter..
[5:54:13] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce
[5:54:18] c0mmander_starscream: Yea, Dude is still mad they didn't finish Star Gate Worlds
[5:54:44] LegoCoin: all games rocket now with HYPE
[5:54:50] CrunkyBrewster: also I didnt think SWG was all that great. It's kind of a "Player Make your Own Fun" kind of MMO.
[5:55:17] Sollice: New World has NO problems with name recognition
[5:55:17] Holy_Z: wow story focus KEKW
[5:55:30] CrunkyBrewster: thats how i got my copy LULW
[5:55:47] CrunkyBrewster: Yeah LA happened
[5:56:01] Rabiahtaro132: New expac for FFXIV
[5:56:01] Gingerprimer: Forbes covering the game is nothing insane since they have gaming section
[5:56:06] Nokterian: Aye LA has more content that new world doesnt have
[5:56:11] rbolude: lost ark, wow patch, endwalker
[5:56:19] LegoCoin: yeah they made it even harder for newer playesr with every patch
[5:56:20] rymerre: also pvp'ers didnt want to grind the same dungeons and loot boxes over and over
[5:56:30] DeuceDempsey: sure but no one going back says a lot
[5:56:32] Sollice: Nothing he said is why I stopped playing. I stopped playing because of the continous gold bugs, trade house nonsense bugs and frankly laggy play in wars
[5:56:36] CrunkyBrewster: I will say this, I think NW combat was pretty cool. And there was some aspects of the grind I did latch on to
[5:56:37] Reckless_Monk: yeah but after you do that, you would think people would come back to NW.. that didnt happened
[5:56:41] zapiiiiiiii: CASUALS DONT LIKE TO PVP WHAT
[5:56:45] robokop365: pvp OMEGALUL
[5:56:46] Nokterian: casuals will never pvp
[5:56:52] winchez_: not to mention all the times i couldn't use the market or trade due to a duping bug
[5:56:53] Kultak: the dupes bugs and running simulator

[5:57:49] Reckless_Monk: crazy dude
[5:57:50] CrunkyBrewster: yeah thats why I dont really get into Fornite games. It looks cool. Played a bit of it. But losing with no reward sucks
[5:58:00] Reckless_Monk: had no clue
[5:58:08] duhworks: is LA the hint for the next game
[5:58:11] LegoCoin: all games do that - just watch steam charts/google trends as well for terms
[5:58:15] Nokterian: no gaming experience as the head of a gaming studios SeemsGood
[5:58:18] robokop365: lost ark has a healty population of bots right now KEKW
[5:58:28] Rictamar: ^^^^
[5:58:42] Holy_Z: oof
[5:58:56] MILESkg21: Lost Bots KEKW
[5:58:58] LazyDynamics: casuals dont like unbalanced pvp(me included)
[5:58:59] DeuceDempsey: its like the halo show creators not even knowing wut halo was
[5:59:05] Rictamar: yeh his thesis isn't wrong, its a failure, and AGS knows it
[5:59:14] PoppaMetal: would love to know LA population not including bots. i think we may be suprised
[5:59:26] Holy_Z: has AGS done anything successful?
[5:59:38] Holy_Z: all their games have been shitshows
[6:00:08] D3m0nHunt3r666: alyClown alyClown alyClown alyClown
[6:00:15] GamerGuy3216: I quit new world because of the war system tbh.  I'm not a fan of one person dictating if i can participate in something or not
[6:00:18] Rastailian: I'm glad this dude ain't a cop or doctor.
[6:00:23] stratiss: This guy forgot the part where they just designed the expertise and umbral endgame within 3 months
[6:00:28] ThatGuyFayde: is the game dead right now, i honestly dont keep up with it?
[6:00:45] CrunkyBrewster: nope
[6:00:50] TheLoho: I think he meant the possible revenue...?
[6:00:51] truehusker: didnt he mean dollars over people
[6:00:52] kodtheog: @ThatGuyFayde its beyond dead
[6:00:55] CrunkyBrewster: at least not at the numbers he's imagining
[6:01:00] Alepouditsa: it just needed more time
[6:01:04] Rictamar: I mean this guy is clearly a clown, but the game NW is dead so he is right there
[6:01:16] St0rmyPl4ys: maybe if they did the market research they would have never even tried to make a sandbox game
[6:01:22] belfastcl: doesn't show though
[6:01:23] DeuceDempsey: theres just no fun or rewarding content
[6:01:24] MILESkg21: what LuL
[6:01:24] JackedDown: He just said they did?
[6:01:27] Aidler: truth is that casuals always follow the herd. if players start to leave a game in significant numbers because for instance another game launches it‚Äôs very difficult to stop the process
[6:01:33] TheKitsuneAdventures: i think this  guy  lives a vacuum this  review  bullsh*t
[6:01:46] Damuffin14: wow
[6:01:47] Arwenack: V:Rising has PvP servers where you drop your entire loot on death, and that has been fairly popular thus far
[6:01:49] PoppaMetal: @TheKitsuneAdventures its not a revierw
[6:01:53] Gingerprimer: One of the biggest pluses for FFXIV is the fact that it has the FF name

[6:02:21] D3m0nHunt3r666: GG
[6:02:25] stratiss: that guy was like 30% correct about his info
[6:02:26] CrunkyBrewster: It should be painful!
[6:02:28] shmasherd: that fella was quite the sleuth. lul
[6:02:28] duhworks: i dont think he means that tho
[6:02:32] robokop365: LUL
[6:02:35] Frank4LuLz: yes
[6:02:35] Ariea_Whisper: I wonder how many people are playing rust Conan last oasis ect atm
[6:02:36] PoppaMetal: and 99 commercials
[6:02:41] EclipserEU: wildstar went the very hadrcore way. you see how it ended :(
[6:02:43] propoopimus: sound good ti me
[6:02:47] Velashen: TheThing
[6:02:49] DeuceDempsey: oh wow later
[6:02:51] LegoCoin: I am still playing NW to be ready for expansion
[6:02:51] raldrik: 100 man guild btw. still feels bad
[6:02:53] propoopimus: id play that and be an apple farmer
[6:02:54] mmo_kenna_: what about all the game breaking bugs and exploits he didnt mention
[6:03:02] Malarick: he wants a Dark Souls version of Farmville
[6:03:06] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Only problem with it is swimming LOL
[6:03:08] Gingerprimer: Yes taknig advice  from ppl that play hardcore sounds great /s
[6:03:08] CrunkyBrewster: what he wants is Immortal Online type stuff
[6:03:12] Phoxzy: Anyone could make a video like this, if you take one or two ideas, and then redundantly keep repeating the same concept over and over.
[6:03:21] PoppaMetal: @mmo_kenna_ trade being down nearly half its life cycle cause of bugs
[6:03:23] CrunkyBrewster: MOrtal rather i mean
[6:03:46] GarlicSizzle: 14k Peak players past 30 days lol
[6:03:55] kowaikokoro: KEKW
[6:04:05] Aidler: he is in line with Asmon and there is a reason these guys don‚Äôt make games‚Ä¶ they only make videos about games
[6:04:22] Deadcells: I couldn‚Äôt do the walking
[6:04:39] MILESkg21: i think you get demonitized if you The Rona iYT 4Head
[6:04:45] MILESkg21: say*
[6:05:07] Gingerprimer: Some ppl seem to think that if only a dev made a hardcore grindy pvp sandbox they will become the next Fortnite and have billions of players
[6:05:22] Ellycat1: Hopefully amazon gives them the time to keep doing it until it's in a great shape
[6:05:23] LazyDynamics: i think so too. i personally hate the melee combat but NW isnt that bad as most people say it is
[6:05:25] Hyelander_: The "death of the MMO" series used to talk about games that were actually dead. Im guessing he is running out of games, so he picked an active game
[6:05:40] yuca247n: does NW have any good story/lore?
[6:05:41] Velashen: It would make the PVP peeps mad but I almost wonder if they came out with an expansion with flying mounts if it would help. I‚Äôd love it personally.
[6:05:44] belfastcl: @Hyeland3r the point is that NW's path so far is the same one that other dead mmorpgs have had before
[6:05:46] CYNIC308: can we please just get a western mmo that can legit compete with a fucking ripoff of Warhammer we've all been playing for almost 20 YEARS!
[6:05:48] Fido_Montoya: I wish they would have kept going with the LOTR MMO instead of this though
[6:05:50] JackedDown: @Hyeland3r "active" KEKW
[6:06:17] rymerre: man fuck tencent
[6:06:19] thee_country_boy_gangsta: oooh another gacha game im sold
[6:06:21] MILESkg21: Active meaning Servers still working KEKW
[6:06:21] Narovoid: Towelliee what is that set of bars in the middle of your UI above your action bars? I see a lot of players using it and I never got to know what it is
[6:06:27] Hyelander_: @Hyeland3r I am plaing it. it is pretty active
[6:06:27] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[6:06:35] Fido_Montoya: Oh yeah good point
[6:06:39] zinbers: I think he has a point yes there some point in his video that are wrong but I think new world will be fine it just has to breath and grow it going to take time for that game to get content
[6:06:46] Fido_Montoya: Forgot about that
[6:06:46] rymerre: steam says 17k in-game right now
[6:06:57] roseclawz: He said it himself, he has a high opinion of himself
[6:07:15] stratiss: There is content planned till the end of the year, let's see where we're at the end of the roadmap
[6:07:17] zinbers: But I think on some parts he wrong
[6:07:20] MILESkg21: oh btw Bioshock collection is FREE on EGS :)
[6:07:26] c0mmander_starscream: lol yeap
[6:07:27] Fido_Montoya: He is definitely set in his ways, favoring really old school MMOs
[6:07:33] thee_country_boy_gangsta: @MilesKG21 i know i just picked it up

[6:08:10] KShellZx: how dare you play a gme for enjoyment and not to be the best!
[6:08:11] VrtniPatuljak: what about EVE
[6:08:11] mmo_kenna_: Lmfao
[6:08:11] QMGSaint: Agreed, but Albion has seen some success in the Sandbox genre
[6:08:16] St0rmyPl4ys: sandbox games only exist in private servers
[6:08:18] belaham: he needs to go play mortal online 2 lol
[6:08:19] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce
[6:08:20] belfastcl: rust seems to be doing ok

[6:08:29] MILESkg21: so we should be weary of AOC also ??
[6:08:30] Moobot: üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[6:08:37] adxx: theme park MMO's are better. still have some content issues in general terms but i like WoW or FF style mmo better
[6:08:38] Velashen: Saying the MMO formula isn‚Äôt long lasting when people are still raiding in EQ1.. he is a clown
[6:08:44] zeitgeiz: They are jump in and play a while. More games to play while waiting for your main game to release new content
[6:08:55] Dragunstorm15: it sounds like hes jaded because they didnt "listen" to what he suggested to them during testing
[6:09:36] MILESkg21: HARDCORE SwiftRage
[6:09:40] thee_country_boy_gangsta: welp im gonna try paladin out in elyon this should be fun
[6:09:43] belaham: He mentioned once
[6:09:45] belfastcl: he did
[6:09:45] Ellycat1: I think he mentioned it like once
[6:09:45] conv3rge_: He mentioned wow once at the end
[6:09:45] belaham: it
[6:09:46] roseclawz: one time
[6:09:47] Fonjin: He mentioned WoW once.
[6:09:49] Rabiahtaro132: He mentioned wow when talking about PVE content!
[6:09:53] Alepouditsa: he playes minecraft Kappa
[6:10:00] adxx: the hardcore player does not satisfy the overall consenus of general players tho
[6:10:00] CYNIC308: Towelliee have you thought about doing AllTheThings ?
[6:10:17] CYNIC308: i just wanna see your %
[6:10:19] belfastcl: you can disagree with the arguments, but the timeline is a collection of facts
[6:10:40] Rabiahtaro132: Probably why they didnt take his suggestions to begin with tbh.
[6:10:45] Starfarmer87: who are we talking about?
[6:10:54] Subjektive: has there been 1 sandbox MMO that has even done it well?

[6:11:21] CYNIC308: New World is not even 9 months old LUL it has $ and is far from dead
[6:11:31] rymerre: the damage is done though...it wont bounce back
[6:11:35] Stonkeep: succesful launches means nothing now, D3 broke records and than what happened
[6:11:36] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:11:36] Aidler: and as I already said why would you invite a guy who‚Äôs only goal is to make a ‚Äûdeath of‚Ä¶.‚Äú video
[6:11:40] belfastcl: @cahoots82 Amazon was investing 500 million a year on AGS
[6:11:45] belaham: I got my monies worth out of New world.
[6:12:01] c0mmander_starscream: Has AGS fixed all the dupping bugs?
[6:12:03] Zyvuun: I lost hope for the MMORPG genre when Everquest Next was canceled.
[6:12:03] mmo_kenna_: lost ark was lit
[6:12:05] Rabiahtaro132: I want New World to succeed, i really believe they can make it a great game.
[6:12:16] c0mmander_starscream: the dupes killed the market
[6:12:24] PoppaMetal: thats more because servers are smaller pop servers
[6:12:41] adxx: People think a game that has under 100,000 concurrent players means its dead lol.
[6:12:49] cahoots82: @belfastcl half a billion dollars a year in an mmo? You got a source on that?
[6:12:51] CYNIC308: LUL mmos are dominated by WoW and FF14 both over 15 years old ... the competition is wide open
[6:12:57] CloudPants8081: jokrdChad
[6:12:58] PoppaMetal: @adxx it has 14k bud its close lol
[6:13:07] Velashen: Yeah the version of the game he was talking about positively was awful.
[6:13:26] CYNIC308: how many bots are playing? LUL
[6:13:31] St0rmyPl4ys: lost ark murdered new world
[6:13:33] belfastcl: @cahoots82 "Amazon is spending nearly $500 million a year operating the video game division" Bloomberg
[6:13:40] PoppaMetal: minus 350k bots
[6:13:42] adxx: @PoppaMetal thats not dead tho lol. You will never talk to that many people in your lifetime
[6:13:50] CYNIC308: NW killed NW
[6:13:52] D3m0nHunt3r666: thats half bots for sure
[6:13:56] CloudPants8081: jokrdAmeno
[6:14:04] St0rmyPl4ys: if the game wasnt popular there wouldnt be as many bots right?
[6:14:09] PoppaMetal: @adxx what ? lol
[6:14:11] cahoots82: @belfastcl and Lost World is their only title?
[6:14:35] thee_country_boy_gangsta: what about Tibia?
[6:14:44] feherlofia123: even if half are bots, lost ark still is way ahead the 200k goal the dev  wanted
[6:14:48] belfastcl: @cahoots82 no, which is why I said "investing on AGS", but on a 5+ developmental cycle, with that kind of money, they have not made their money back
[6:14:52] thee_country_boy_gangsta: NW neverwinter or new world?
[6:15:04] St0rmyPl4ys: i remember watching lost ark streamers from NA use VPNs to play on the russia server last year
[6:15:14] sixgunr: yeah Korea has been killing it in lost ark.
[6:15:16] stratiss: it also depends on whose streaming it, gotta have good creators
[6:15:21] PoppaMetal: more like LA had years of content
[6:15:23] mmo_kenna_: Lost Ark was a complete game and not a new IP
[6:15:25] thee_country_boy_gangsta: what was that game that flopped over here in the States.... blessed right?
[6:15:28] CYNIC308: yea Lost Ark is not a new game its been out for a while
[6:15:28] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[6:15:54] ThatGuyFayde: LUL
[6:16:06] thee_country_boy_gangsta: the exploits made it the worst
[6:16:20] CYNIC308: yea if they had no tech issues New World would be huge right now
[6:16:29] c0mmander_starscream: PeeVeePeeee
[6:16:32] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce
[6:16:36] MILESkg21: too many elitest douches 4Head
[6:16:50] TheKitsuneAdventures: i miss warhammer  age of  reckonning
[6:16:52] LordxSaura: I dont understand Lost Ark, its a gambling simulator for me and i dont see how it can retain healthy player base
[6:16:56] c0mmander_starscream: Archage
[6:17:07] Frank4LuLz: wow is so toxic
[6:17:07] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[6:17:08] mmo_kenna_: M+
[6:17:08] MILESkg21: Archage or BDO
[6:17:09] thee_country_boy_gangsta: archeage oh geez i hate that game
[6:17:09] adxx: Hence why designers and devs should not be led by the "hardcore
[6:17:21] Xilyane: They def need to add some more variety in the leveling, which they are doing. I got burnt out at 40. Its not bad it just, idk.
[6:17:28] Rabiahtaro132: PVE games like ffxiv have very friendly communities compaired to pvp.
[6:17:42] St0rmyPl4ys: even ffxiv has some toxicity
[6:17:43] CYNIC308: BDO > Archeage
[6:17:46] EclipserEU: a lof of blizzard devs had 0 mmo XP back then
[6:17:46] thee_country_boy_gangsta: sooo im still waiting on anthem to come back out but im sure it wont
[6:18:27] CYNIC308: LUL the Blizzard devs were HUGE everquest players and MUD fanatics!
[6:18:35] thee_country_boy_gangsta: sooo uhh how about that blue protocol eh
[6:18:43] belfastcl: @EclipserEU a lot of the main wow devs were EQ and UO junkies
[6:18:48] Tiluvar: Also the people making WoW were all experienced EverQuest players.
[6:18:50] feherlofia123: i been leveling alts in wow lately and the amount of mages ive seen been kicked (new players) because they didnt know what conjura mana food was is insane. wow players are toxic
[6:18:53] thee_country_boy_gangsta: they went silent and havent said much XD
[6:19:20] thee_country_boy_gangsta: but obi wan is on @Towelliee
[6:19:37] thee_country_boy_gangsta: you can exploit the leveling mechanic as well
[6:19:41] CYNIC308: AND they stealth nerfed the leveling LUL
[6:19:53] Gingerprimer: And also alot of what happend with wow was not planned they have talked about how they did not plan for ppl to do the same dungeon multiple times
[6:20:22] thee_country_boy_gangsta: i used cooking in my tent to get my level up but i played out the last 4 or 5 levels
[6:20:31] zeitgeiz: I never made it to max, friend all quit by the time I was 10 levels away so it wasn‚Äôt as fun after that
[6:20:35] MILESkg21: SAME KEKW
[6:20:40] feherlofia123: why wow doesnt have a thing like ffxiv where new players have a sprout above their character still baffles me
[6:20:40] conv3rge_: It's gonna be a collab with Bellular
[6:20:41] PvtHudson093: KEKW
[6:20:46] CloudPants8081: wow video next? jokrdKEKW
[6:20:50] Fragglevision: well now we have to get him to do it
[6:20:59] Ogumel: WoW video next LUL
[6:21:02] Lulaboo: KEKWlaugh
[6:21:02] Velashen: I can‚Äôt wait till I can cue for dungeons.
[6:21:02] St0rmyPl4ys: if he makes a death of wow video it will be similar to his overwatch video,  where its only dead cause the playerbase is waiting for the confirmed sequel.
[6:21:07] zeitgeiz: Promises promises
[6:21:08] EclipserEU: @feherlofia123 they have. its a murlock. but to see it you have to be a mentor
[6:21:14] MILESkg21: nobody wanted that
[6:21:16] Ellycat1: The statement of all people wanting it was a bit... wat
[6:21:23] dracullus: who are we talking about?
[6:21:24] TheKitsuneAdventures: the guy seem to  live in a vacuum  himself
[6:21:27] vic_ave: When is this New World double exp?
[6:21:28] Gingerprimer: @feherlofia123 because nobody would use that system in wow
[6:21:38] JaseLeland: Amazon has at least 1 more MMO they haven't even officially announced yet as well
[6:21:39] CYNIC308: tards have been predicting and celebrating the "death" of WoW for a loooong time now! LUL
[6:21:46] vic_ave: thanks
[6:21:51] feherlofia123: @gingerprimer theres plenty of new players coming to wow at any given time
[6:21:52] dimofodi: Yea, he nailed the business end but missed entirely on the game end of it.
[6:21:57] MILESkg21: WOW been dying since Cata 4Head
[6:21:59] thee_country_boy_gangsta: well that disconnected from reality when mentioned the game was delayed i lost it LUL
[6:22:08] Aidler: well, he makes his money with these videos‚Ä¶ so the outcome is predetermined
[6:22:24] CloudPants8081: drop rate ? LUL
[6:22:30] Velashen: tall glass of hateraid he was sipping.
[6:22:36] Gingerprimer: @feherlofia123 I still do not think those ppl would care about a system like that
[6:22:42] CYNIC308: he has become LazyPeon and just shits on every game because its more views
[6:23:27] feherlofia123: @gingerprimer it would help new players leveling in chromie time out because theyre getting kicked left and right for no reason for stupid stuff... like not buffing etc
[6:23:31] thee_country_boy_gangsta: so ashes of creation and crowfall are dead ?
[6:23:43] Velashen: Yes
[6:23:49] Tooyoo: crowfall died faster than New world
[6:24:00] JaseLeland: ashes being PVP is why I'm not excited for it
[6:24:07] thee_country_boy_gangsta: just dont do faction shit like arcehage did please dont
[6:24:12] KShellZx: Bring back Wildstar
[6:24:15] CYNIC308: Crowfall was a $5 million kickstarter mmo tho
[6:24:16] CloudPants8081: amazon should buy blizzard Kappa
[6:24:21] Xilyane: If new world didnt start as a pvp pure game and change halfway through development, I think it would have had more PVE content. Thats the inexperience coming into play
[6:24:28] Gingerprimer: Yeah ashehs my fav new mmo in 2056
[6:24:28] poweredstern: pluto is dying they are going to maramama
[6:24:29] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!
[6:24:31] thee_country_boy_gangsta: @KShellZx no thank you pvp ruined it for me
[6:24:38] zeitgeiz: Crowfall launched?
[6:24:40] Stonkeep: with 1 patch, new world completely alienate the entire crafting/farming playerbase
[6:24:43] rymerre: Elon should buy AGS
[6:24:43] belfastcl: my warhammer server had people playing until the last day :(
[6:24:59] feherlofia123: was new world pvp any good. i never tried it. i heard from Xaryu he enjoyed pvp a lot
[6:25:01] thee_country_boy_gangsta: Elyon @rymere1983 ?
[6:25:41] rymerre: @TheZombieOfAmerica Elon Musk
[6:25:46] zeitgeiz: New world was good for high end players with people to group with and lots of time. New world pvp was horrible for casuals
[6:25:48] thee_country_boy_gangsta: ohhh LUL
[6:25:55] rymerre: my main is on Pluto
[6:25:58] Velashen: I say put out an expansion with mounts. Who cares if the pvp people hate it.
[6:26:08] destiny25: What zone is this music from @Towelliee
[6:26:12] Stonkeep: @zeitgeiz pretty much
[6:26:24] LordxSaura: @Velashen map is already small for the mounts, the game`s issue is not mounts
[6:26:35] dracullus: @destiny25 Nightsong from Cata
[6:26:36] CrunkyBrewster: Minecraft Kappa
[6:26:39] thee_country_boy_gangsta: warhammer mmo was sooo good
[6:26:40] josephrt10: @destiny25  ashenvale
[6:26:48] thee_country_boy_gangsta: i miss ragnarok
[6:26:54] CYNIC308: Warhammer came out ONE MONTH before WotLK came out! :(
[6:26:54] rymerre: yep i remember that
[6:27:12] thee_country_boy_gangsta: i feel like ragnarok really respected your time as a player
[6:27:12] CrunkyBrewster: thats how Cyrodiil PVP is ESO
[6:27:14] audderd: Why do people keep switching servers in New World?
[6:27:16] destiny25: thank you
[6:27:30] thee_country_boy_gangsta: @audderd prolly cause of streamers or freind
[6:27:33] thee_country_boy_gangsta: friends*(
[6:27:35] CrunkyBrewster: it is fun dont get me wrong
[6:27:40] CrunkyBrewster: i just dont grind it
[6:27:57] JaseLeland: only reason I go into cyrodiil is for PVE reasons LUL
[6:28:00] LordxSaura: @Crunku_ not really. The points are varied based on how much you held the castles and all. And its all a server effort not a clan or group themselves
[6:28:09] CYNIC308: Towelliee you should try the Warhammer private server "Return of Reckoning"
[6:28:09] Ogumel: I normally don't PvP because of how high it makes my blood pressure rise.
[6:28:10] belfastcl: cyro doesn't affect the outside game though, in warhammer you could lose access to your capital city due to siege results
[6:28:25] rymerre: @belfastcl yuuup
[6:28:38] LordxSaura: and you conquered those castles at night even if they are taken away, your points are still contributed depending on how many castles you got and how long you held
[6:29:06] Xilyane: gw2 leveling design is still one of my favorite ways to level.
[6:29:06] CloudPants8081: why not dropping on amazon luna
[6:29:14] CrunkyBrewster: @fatihbaja yeah i understand. my point of view of it though playing ont he most casual server, it was a rotation of who owned what, when, scrolls, etc.
[6:29:17] WSquiggle12: I had fun with new world but after the second dupe bug I quit because I couldn't keep up with it
[6:29:23] thee_country_boy_gangsta: or stadia @StadiaProPants ninjaaSmug
[6:29:33] CloudPants8081: murdaGrin
[6:29:36] SonofHorus82: damn I missed the reaction.
[6:29:41] BarryBombplant: people looking forward to a war for days, and when it finally comes, people just lag out and cant move for 30 minutes probably turned away many pvpers
[6:29:50] CYNIC308: i liked losing them because it meant you could now take them back
[6:30:00] thee_country_boy_gangsta: ive bene playing more mobile games lately XD
[6:30:17] CYNIC308: Warhammer did pvp right and there was a reason and it was fun and you didnt worry about dying
[6:30:17] CrunkyBrewster: Old Wintergrasp PepeWhy
[6:30:32] thee_country_boy_gangsta: RIP Anthem
[6:30:36] Xilyane: Yea NW devs have said the engine is hard to work with. It wasnt made from scratch for an mmo. Def doesnt help
[6:30:39] Ellycat1: The problem with fixes is that it doesn't bring back the people. I suspect once amazon fixes it and does a big release it might save it... assuming it gets that far of course.
[6:30:40] Shirey36: starwars pushed the whole xmogs into wow
[6:30:42] Kadvem: a lot of mmos get rushed
[6:30:55] warrenny: The base gane with class stories is great imo
[6:30:56] WSquiggle12: Have any recomendations @TheZombieOfAmerica ? I've been looking for a mobile game to tide me over at work
[6:30:58] Ogumel: gotta get those holiday sales, though!
[6:31:07] Ogumel: those holiday sales, man!
[6:31:10] dimofodi: deadlines man....DEADLINES lol
[6:31:11] CYNIC308: EA launched SWTOR broken and killed Warhammer because they thought Star Wars would be bigger than Warhammer! LUL
[6:31:15] Ogumel: so important
[6:31:19] zeitgeiz: Just downloaded Star Wars last night, thought my son would like watching and picking story options
[6:31:24] belfastcl: mmos with shit engines, never heard Kappa
[6:31:34] warrenny: @cynic308 Makes sense
[6:31:37] CYNIC308: EA killed Warhammer AND Star Wars mmo LUL
[6:31:40] JaseLeland: games are still being delayed because of covid this year
[6:31:42] Tooyoo: Everyone knows Sanctum of Domination was the epitome of WoW devleopment >_>
[6:31:46] Aidler: imagine what happens when Apple buys EA. they had talks
[6:31:58] CrunkyBrewster: oh god

[6:32:09] warrenny: @tooyoo Hell no
[6:32:11] CloudPants8081: ddashSW
[6:32:15] rymerre: what if...Elon bought EA?
[6:32:15] thee_country_boy_gangsta: apple cloud based gaming when
[6:32:22] Tooyoo: apple would make EA put so many games on their apple arcade :(
[6:32:29] feherlofia123: its been 2 years since riot announced they would make an MMO ... nothing yet
[6:32:30] thee_country_boy_gangsta: nope but i will now @Towelliee thanks
[6:32:35] dimofodi: Consider Apple buying EA like Microsoft bringing on Activision, it allows them to do much more in so many ways.
[6:32:35] TakeThatBack: i dun do mobile games i read books ;x
[6:32:37] CloudPants8081: mobile is the future xd
[6:32:40] skylerNsadie: way better than PUBG or COD mobile, that shit is trash
[6:32:42] Two_Headed_Raven: next BF on macs only LUL
[6:32:49] rymerre: @feherlofia123 MMOs take 7+ years
[6:32:55] JaseLeland: mobile is the now, they already make more money than other games
[6:32:57] Deadcells: EA is smart for selling right now, they are about to lose the FIFA License
[6:33:00] WSquiggle12: @TheZombieOfAmerica Nice! I just downloaded ni no kuni last night but haven't cracked it open yet
[6:33:10] Deadcells: Sell when your price is highest
[6:33:15] thee_country_boy_gangsta: @WSquiggle12 its fun
[6:33:16] CrunkyBrewster: is that a thing going on? EA selling?
[6:33:23] Velashen: People don‚Äôt realize how much money Apple makes on games.
[6:33:28] Deadcells: They are thinking about it
[6:33:30] Damuffin14: ea is selling?
[6:33:30] Moobot:  Hammer Squad will be hosting an ESO Marathon from 6/6-6/10 for the High Isle Update! Save the date!

[6:34:00] CrunkyBrewster: ah damn 6/6 I got a wedding to go to blah!
[6:34:00] NewWorldReign: You think the music on WoW has gone better throughout the expansions?
[6:34:17] warrenny: @newworldreign Yes
[6:34:25] Aidler: @damuffin14 Apple and EA had talks. that‚Äôs confirmed. nothing came out of it so far
[6:34:59] JaseLeland: they had talks with comcast as well
[6:35:04] Oatu: Oatu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months!
