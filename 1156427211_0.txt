[3:18:27] eyo_o7: well if thinks like that happens that just means that the tank hasnt realy any aggro on that mob and thats why it runs to the healer. and since you wanna help by gouging or whatever you end up getting the aggro realy quick and die
[3:18:40] eyo_o7: you could go in there to help with having evasion up

[4:23:44] Bobka: When the ads are respawning and your range is burning down thaladred , go shiv 5x time with the dagger real quick . he will take 25% more magic damage for 30 sec
[4:23:46] Furyhots: @BobkaWoW lets hear it
[4:23:53] Bobka: just sprint and apply it
[4:23:56] Bobka: and run back to your melee adds

[4:24:16] Bishox: also you can pop evasion
[4:24:19] Bobka: yes
[4:24:30] Bishox: pop evasion so you dont get 1 shot
[4:24:34] Bobka: no
[4:24:39] Bobka: u will wipe
[4:24:50] Bobka: only thaladred with sprint and evasion
[4:24:52] Bobka: quick 5 shiv
[4:24:55] Bishox: she will arcane explosion
