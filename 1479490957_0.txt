[4:34:33] Se7enthSinn: right
[4:34:45] Strifelol: Just for the challenge according to him, to get another belt in another division
[4:34:46] c3llout7: @Towelliee hows that survival hunter coming along?
[4:34:51] Strifelol: Basically lol
[4:34:53] Daismoon: That whole pound for pound shit

[4:35:27] Arcadass: @ThatGuyFayde  yh same to u smh
[4:36:05] ThatGuyFayde: @arcadass SeemsGood
[4:37:02] Strifelol: @arcadass Going up a weight division was a big reason he lost, Bivol is used to that type of power punches, he's used to being conditioned for that weight class. If you think that wasn't a factor then idk lol Bivol was also very very good can't take that away from him, awesome boxer.
[4:37:22] ThatGuyFayde: :)

[4:39:23] Arcadass: @Strifelol  i dont take it away from him bivol won that fight and even higher than that score board, but anyway he could not do against that style  it was not just about the power he got countered everytime he could not see any gaps .

[4:44:49] Mecabeast: in pugs i grab 2nd interupt cause no one grabs that one
[4:45:15] GamerKillance: WoW is now based around addons
[4:45:24] Strifelol: QOL from addons is just too good.
[4:45:26] Arocian: It would be the end of the world
[4:45:37] Arcadass: ppl would still play the game LULW
[4:45:40] metavahn231: you need addons because you cant see whats happening in 2004 graphics
[4:45:41] swordart2022: They block few already.
[4:45:41] Arocian: A huge pop wouldn't be able to play the game without the addons
[4:45:50] TriumphyTv: not true
[4:45:53] KaisenSiru: Bunch of sheep LULW
[4:45:53] mavericks312: the no addons community is very niche dont fool yourself
[4:45:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: They will disable dungeon finder add-ons for Classic LUL
[4:45:56] swordart2022: @elixirfield1 false get glasses and use ears.
[4:46:03] GamerKillance: scottfShrug
[4:46:05] bswindlewars: A lot of ppl play of mods tho
[4:46:10] Persephonae: vocal minority and they put like all of them on the community council LUL
[4:46:13] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 10 years from now? leaked?
[4:46:13] swordart2022: They will stop all who do "computing" /thinking :P
[4:46:17] illusion1990: dmb and weak aura are the only two i think shoudl go
[4:46:25] zgag: Asmongold had to get a new PC just to use the 100 add-ons he has installed. The guy probably uses more add-on's than anyone I know
[4:46:28] TriumphyTv: forgot this is why i dont watch this duumb ass
[4:46:28] metavahn231: game looks so bad that you cant make out whats happening, way too many spell effects
[4:46:33] mavericks312: dbm isnt going anywhere
[4:46:52] mavericks312: @elixirfield1 just say you hate wow
[4:46:57] metavahn231: people need airhorns to tell them they are standing in things KEKW
[4:47:00] swordart2022: @IBBLE14 ?
[4:47:06] Throdio: Much like flying, it's too late for them to do anything about it
[4:47:12] swordart2022: @elixirfield1 What nonsesne are you talking about
[4:47:25] knifeparrty: this game looks great in 4k
[4:47:26] swordart2022: @IBBLE14 addons make you weaker
[4:47:34] metavahn231: the literal 100s of addons people need to play this game LUL
[4:47:52] metavahn231: i dont need any in FFXIV
[4:47:52] swordart2022: @elixirfield1 nope
[4:47:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: people like to reference ffxiv for not having addons, meanwhile the top players use addons anyway
[4:48:04] hammack52: i think at the point in time bliz is making changes to their UI to get it out of the way for the addon moders
[4:48:24] swordart2022: false
[4:48:29] illusion1990: I think they shoudl go
[4:48:30] Vendralos: I do honestly
[4:48:33] illusion1990: no mods
[4:48:34] illusion1990: at all
[4:48:36] swordart2022: I got 3k score no dbm neither weak auras.
[4:48:38] Morpserie: get rid of em
[4:48:40] Rexialiton: Yeah thats bullshit
[4:48:43] swordart2022: DBM and Wa makes you weak and dumb :P
[4:48:48] mavericks312: @IBBLE14 terrible take
[4:48:51] CritcobainTV: all these addon haters KEKW
[4:48:57] swordart2022: False
[4:49:07] illusion1990: exactly that is stupid....designing around addoning is dumb and degrades the game imo
[4:49:14] zgag: I personally don't have an issue with some players using add-on that help them. Wowgrandma who is an 80 yr old player it really helps here out.  Not everyone needs or uses them all
[4:49:17] Morpserie: KEKW
[4:49:20] nihilistic_bat: riiight
[4:49:21] darssia_: @illusion1990 they literally said they have.
[4:49:26] c0mmander_starscream: whats the drama with addons? the Mythic warrior tryhards want a harder game?
[4:49:27] Persephonae: the only addon id be effed without is TSM, but without that all the economy players would just watch the world burn LUL
[4:49:28] Vendralos: The content is getting harder and harder because addons are getting better and better. That's a bit of a problem
[4:49:30] swordart2022: yes they are remove them and they are clueless
[4:49:43] Rexialiton: @swordart2022 dont come here and say, that you dont use any addons at all KEKW
[4:49:54] GamerKillance: @swordart2022 I dare you to do the hardest content then. Tell me its "easy" with addons
[4:49:56] GamerKillance: Show me
[4:50:04] Artenuous: @swordart2022 is that why they cleared ffxiv hardest content? LUL
[4:50:07] assman_ny: Exactly, I am to old anymore.  I use what works
[4:50:09] swordart2022: @Rexialiton i use addons for cusomization nothing else .
[4:50:15] CritcobainTV: content is getting harder because players get better
[4:50:17] Arocian: Ion was asked a question about it in one of the early interviews recently and he said something  about limits to addons as if it was thought about
[4:50:20] Vendralos: You've been playing for years though, it's tough for new players
[4:50:20] hammack52: im sorry but if you want a game that has no add-on go play SWTOR that game has no add-ons, and see how a develpment of a no add-on game is
[4:50:23] Rexialiton: @swordart2022 suuuure
[4:50:28] darssia_: if you don’t like addons just don’t use them. simple.
[4:50:29] theDirtyon3: monkaS
[4:50:34] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[4:50:42] swordart2022: @Rexialiton you should try playing game with sound and clean ui .
[4:50:46] Vendralos: @annassae The game would be too hard without them
[4:50:47] KaisenSiru: monkaW
[4:50:48] mavericks312: @IBBLE14 tell that to WF raiders
[4:50:49] CritcobainTV: @IBBLE14 Link me your cutting edge achieves
[4:50:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: chadbomb got all the love
[4:50:51] ThatGuyFayde: @Towelliee  go DPS let stream carry a 15
[4:50:53] GamerKillance: Then do that content and show me it isn't hard @IBBLE14
[4:50:53] theDirtyon3: @Towelliee I have a shaman with a 15 we can throw just need some pumpers
[4:50:56] GamerKillance: Show us
[4:50:57] illusion1990: dbm doesn tell you where to go
[4:51:02] metavahn231: they need to actually make the game easier
[4:51:04] Elizare: wow look at all the "no addons" warriors come out of the shadows
[4:51:07] Arocian: right
[4:51:12] illusion1990: mechanics are mechanics without addons
[4:51:15] metavahn231: almost no one even clears Wow content anymore
[4:51:18] KaisenSiru: Nice take PepeLaugh
[4:51:19] Aypex01: no, the game is just designed around the assumption that everyone has DBM at all timees
[4:51:19] zgag: Asmon add-on fix came from playing games like FF.  If the guy wants a game like FF he should play FF or create his own game.
[4:51:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 11/11... LFR
[4:51:20] darssia_: @vendralos but it’s too easy now?
[4:51:27] Morpserie: making it sound like DBM is carrying you through content lmao
[4:51:35] Lexi__Marie: cant carry a tank in 15s but i bet chat could carry you as dps
[4:51:38] Vendralos: @annassae No it's not
[4:51:42] GamerKillance: They refuse to acknowledge they can kill the fights with addons LOL
[4:51:43] mavericks312: then why didi SoFo take 3 weeks?
[4:51:51] Arocian: good point
[4:51:57] CritcobainTV: LFR Andies KEKW
[4:52:04] Artenuous: imagine thinking an air horn is carrying you in mythic raids
[4:52:07] yeti82: asmon just sad, he is a casual now :P
[4:52:07] hammack52: But FF has add-ons
[4:52:09] mavericks312: no asmon tried to pug it week 1 and failed
[4:52:10] swordart2022: @Biby07 no addon should compute instead of player.
[4:52:17] Persephonae: @Alexis___QT why dont you carry him then lexi Kappa
[4:52:20] Aypex01: i think its just that the game is now designed with DBM in mind. so just integrate it into the game somehow
[4:52:23] illusion1990: halondrus pre nerfs was dumb
[4:52:26] Throdio: Lost Ark has no addons, thats another one people can play if they want no addons
[4:52:26] metavahn231: blizz needs to make dbz official then and something that updates in official patches at this point
[4:52:29] Rexialiton: @swordart2022 what are you on about mate? With sound? Da fuck KEKW (i have played with "clean ui". I don't like it. I like my ElvUI just fine :)
[4:52:32] magemaster225: becasue the bosses were tuned harder beause the game is designed on addons
[4:52:35] swordart2022: @Aypex01 nope dbm makes you weaker.
[4:52:40] theDirtyon3: LUL
[4:52:47] CritcobainTV: just throw the 226 anima gear on you'll be fiiiine
[4:52:48] Nalleys: KEKW
[4:52:48] Lexi__Marie: @Persephonae lol ive barely been into 15s
[4:52:49] swordart2022: @Rexialiton clean ui does not mean using wow default ui.
[4:52:50] Aypex01: @swordart2022 what do you mean weaker?
[4:53:04] metavahn231: they only make it hard so armchair gamer dads who dont even raid wont complain its too easy KEKW
[4:53:09] swordart2022: @Aypex01 you do not "feel" when thing happens just look at timers .
[4:53:10] Persephonae: @Alexis___QT too busy on simplearmory instead of dungeons
[4:53:17] illusion1990: top guild without addond will still be top guilds.
[4:53:21] Arocian: spreadsheets
[4:53:23] Elizare: @swordart2022 if you dont like addons, dont use them, dont force your opinion on other people when it doesnt effect you
[4:53:24] illusion1990: they will figure it out regardless
[4:53:42] Arocian: we had a spreadsheet for four horseman
[4:53:44] Aypex01: @swordart2022 no i agree it would "feel better" without it. but the game is now designed from thee ground up with DBM in mind
[4:53:44] mavericks312: liquid an echo will still be liquid and echo with or without addons
[4:53:46] Maneguster: People used to use traps and flares as markers in classic
[4:53:47] illusion1990: can compare vanialla to now. time differential is to great
[4:53:50] Snabido: LF time person to fill out our raid team Kappa
[4:53:50] metavahn231: i would quit this game in a second without addons, but any other game i can play without addons, its not designed well enough to go without
[4:53:54] illusion1990: cant*
[4:53:54] Snabido: *timer
[4:53:57] KickyMcFace: By that logic you can't have anyone tell you when things are coming, that's the same as having DBM
[4:54:23] swordart2022: @Aypex01 nope i got 2908 m+ rating if you have clean ui and sound on no need addons,
[4:54:34] Breeb1: @KickyMcFace raid leaders xD
[4:54:56] Arcadass: @swordart2022  yh nice its 18 keys lol
[4:55:09] swordart2022: @Elizare i use a lot of addons , iam against addons which "think" instead of players. :P
[4:55:10] hammack52: here is what i have to say, if you dont want to use the add-on dont use them, but dont come at people that do use them sideways
[4:55:13] KickyMcFace: @Breeb1 Exactly, guess we can't have those anymore. gg.

[4:55:22] Arocian: yeah
[4:55:31] metavahn231: they would actually need to design the content well if they removed addons LUL
[4:55:31] Snabido: Sprinkle some wildstar visuals
[4:55:37] swordart2022: There are . none of you are playing with sound and abilities
[4:55:40] swordart2022: YO9u all
[4:55:43] metavahn231: whats wrong with indicators tho
[4:55:44] mavericks312: blizz isnt gonna get rid of addons the backlash would be to big
[4:55:47] raymond3195: you unlock your soulbinds
[4:55:52] swordart2022: You all should play without that in first place .P
[4:56:04] Malfleur: you can also see when which ability comes if you look at the boss like left paw up x, right paw y
[4:56:06] illusion1990: past wrath
[4:56:18] hammack52: @Towelliee Look at SWTOR, that game has no add-ons, they are not allowed, and look at what they have to do with their boss designs
[4:56:20] illusion1990: late BC for addon dependency
[4:56:25] magemaster225: because the players that want an easier play that doesnt need addons left the game
[4:56:28] Breeb1: you can make your own ui thats fucking amazing

[4:57:37] Maneguster: The addon I use to track how much I jump in a dungeon makes the game to easy
[4:57:38] blueantonio3: i think what they mean is that the raids r too difficult rn, add ons make it harder, if u take out addons and lower raid difficulty, more people would play i think
[4:57:40] Stealinheals: my love for wow always came from the community aspect and thats been gone for me since like cata
[4:57:44] Robx: i love addons, but i hope i can get rid of elvui with their new ui in dragonflight

[5:04:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, you have to be good with charge-weaving to get the most out of the reprisal legendary
