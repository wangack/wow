Also I think watching someone sleep is kind of similar to watching someone get a massage.. it makes me feel good knowing they feel good. It's almost like I'm living vicariously through your experience. Also watching someone sleep for couple of minutes sends my mind into deep thought and prepares me for my sleep.

[2:39:56] cabalish: they did
[2:40:20] Tyr7: probably used vantus on smold
[2:40:20] AlphasaurusRexx: its a mechanically intensive fight. i dont think its unkillable mathematically though
[2:40:33] rbgdev: @nvbrutal I said yesterday I’d have my laundry done today but it’s unlikely
[2:40:38] xcryptoreaperx: hey folks
[2:40:43] Lintgamer: @Tyr7 No both teams used it on this boss

[2:40:59] ElmSpace: the orange chicken for dinner is taking awhile to cook
[2:41:31] NVbrutal: they dont want it to be nerfed again they think its killable as is but we will see
[2:41:44] rbgdev: Is there anymore gear they can get?
[2:41:46] notColt45: a broken clock is right twice a day
[2:42:04] mavericks312: yea max said they really didnt try to get to phase 3 alot yesterday to avoid giving details to echo
[2:42:11] Sharkeys: KEKW its true. its only the real sickos who like watching them just run face first into a wall every pull with maybe a change every 45 pulls
[2:42:16] nevercluckyy: every whines about not having a real raid tier until they get a real raid tier then they complain that it takes too long
[2:42:28] jackh189: @towelliee do you play on all alts all the time or do you play on a main ?

[2:42:45] tomfoolery_1: Who is staying up all night figuring out other strategies lol.
[2:42:59] toobaked1987: How does Blizzard decide who is on the beneficial side of the nerf?
[2:43:16] Niksen_99: Max got like 10 DC yesterday. Comon Liquid cant be happening
[2:43:25] mavericks312: max said the strategy changed to avoid giving echo tips for phase 3 and just focus on perfecting phase 2

[4:51:10] DunzoCD: @Molvonos have you tried much shaman? its been a fun alt for me and its versatile for how you want to play at the time with ranged/melee dps or heal

[4:58:32] DunzoCD: @DunzoCD well i guess shaman might not be the best for mythic raiding then with no real raid buff, i dont know a whole lot about mythic raiding guilds requirements though, but it is a fun alt to quest on and a fast mog farmer with wolf form
