[0:51:17] GrimWizard: i dont understand why it wasnt out on release. no one is doing it
[0:51:19] SpaceCowboy0811: I dont like the vibes of it sharing non SSF server
[0:51:26] ohioliving: payo pokeYikes
[0:51:32] ScootSmith: i think staysafe already stopped SF HC
[0:51:35] CamGG__: not huge hype but guzu kind of a hc legend so could save hc
[0:51:37] GrimWizard: but making a new server would just be another dead server
[0:51:38] BikiniBodhi: because player count is low on hc in general
[0:51:38] Fudge_Nuggets: Not enough players for a new server LUL
[0:51:41] fr03doc: are you sharing your millions with @mordiell or you gonna get a pre-nump? KappaHD
[0:51:41] dirbagdan: it would be dead

[0:51:46] cosmin284: wideVIBE plinkVibe fuegoVibe
[0:51:46] JoshOTWO: yesss
[0:51:47] jackpepsimba: Blizz's implementation of SF and not SSF, with no achieves like the addon had made it a bust
[0:51:50] IndigoSus: no one would play on new server i bet
[0:51:51] YlaWoW: Not enough ppl for SSF
[0:51:52] v1russssssss: yeah... as non sf hc player it kinda sucks to go dungeon with a sf player
[0:52:00] 3Brick_: @BikiniBodhi well their fault for not adding SSF from the start LULW
[0:52:03] SpaceCowboy0811: bloodsail was very low pop, and height of HC. at least for me
[0:52:10] Guzumerchmanager: hmm but its FRESH ? people love fresh
[0:52:19] Grashh: I thought the reason HC was good was because it got people out in the world and actually playing the game over raid logging but with SoD it fills that need for me atleast
[0:52:20] JoshOTWO: not rn
[0:52:20] GrimWizard: it's not fresh lul
[0:52:24] Sharpnel_89: If SSF was on a complete new server i would play it, now it just feels wrong cause people can boost the sf character with there main if they wanted
[0:52:27] Qiima1: wow sod is just better than sf hc in ole servers

[1:31:22] Supibot: vahngogeta, ü§ñ It seems like you may be referring to a common misspelling or mishearing of the word "moose." A moose is a large, solitary animal with antlers that is native to the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. They are known for their impressive size and unique appearance.

[1:46:59] sircrumpler: People overlook what vanilla is about cuz they want extreme hype. But SoD is also about revisiting and re-enjoying the slower side of vanilla

[1:48:32] dustyd0nuts: dont pick a pvp server?
[1:48:40] Bishox: @Guzu as soon as it becomes 55/45 you will lose most fights,  its not fun to always lose
[1:48:44] jwr2112: Greetings Guzu!

[1:48:57] 999Joshy: TBC is the legit bottom of the barrel

[1:48:59] alextheblight: hope so
[1:49:01] mlady_telegramz97: no
[1:49:02] handovdoom666: nah, MoP was better
[1:49:02] Ceodewd: That is very subjective tho
[1:49:03] cobraCordite: It's not that easy though, it costs money and resources
[1:49:03] dirbagdan: tbc sucked ass
[1:49:04] sircrumpler: TBC was the most well rounded xpac
[1:49:04] Djinx_o: outlands meh
[1:49:05] Bishox: i love TBC
[1:49:05] ozzyboy99: guzu what happened to the druid u leveld in tbc
[1:49:06] TMMOOF: I want official tbc servers so badly
[1:49:07] Asmii: only good if fresh
[1:49:09] SirHeiska: Easily the best one
[1:49:09] Effen13: Hi Guzu Welcome home! Did you have a nice trip?
[1:49:10] Blufootgaming: tbc was the worst wow i played in my experience
[1:49:10] specialkidmiles: TBC is the best
[1:49:11] ChimpanQ: MoP
[1:49:11] Degran: TBC is hands down the best WoW Expac
[1:49:12] Fudge_Nuggets: MoP
[1:49:13] johnboy1012: TBC raids were awesome
[1:49:13] Chlamydious: TBC is up there for me
[1:49:14] Wolok: tbc = grp comp sweats
[1:49:14] Nomsinn: I speak for everyone when i say this... we dont want tbc
[1:49:15] alextheblight: it's definitely up there
[1:49:16] Nomsinn: monkaW
[1:49:18] Nomsinn: !vanish
[1:49:20] gorebag13: wrath or mop
[1:49:20] kamura2: number of active subs in wrath proves , wrath was the best xpac... end of discussion
[1:49:20] Myrror: I'm a die hard mop man myself
[1:49:20] ZFredddy: i think retail does world pvp best with the war mode option to dip in and out
[1:49:20] paco__gutierrez: Tbc is the best expansion vanilla is the best tho
[1:49:23] dirbagdan: the best expansion is no expansion
[1:49:23] Yvernaa: TBC was the best out of the 3 first wow
[1:49:23] Guzumerchmanager: TBC pre-nerf heroic farm etc is really fun
[1:49:23] Horfent: TBC was alright. there are others who were far greater imo
[1:49:26] Chlamydious: TBC, MOP, Legion, loved them all
[1:49:26] Zarkawii: "arguably" being the key word.
[1:49:27] assasinatorbg: maybe only lk mop and vanila are better than bc
[1:49:27] Rahmulous: tbc is not even close to the best. y‚Äôall are classic Andy‚Äôs coping hsrd
[1:49:27] Yvernaa: But not the best in general
[1:49:29] GHOST97915: I think Blizzard is aware that TBC is their best product on shelf, so they are saving it for last
[1:49:30] MonkeyOverlord: the only good thing about TBC are arenas
[1:49:36] inst1nctCS: TBC is good tho
[1:49:36] ObsidianHealer: Wouldnt booting up a lot of servers sever the player base by a ton?
[1:49:36] mala_okolicka: tbc to me is boring sitt
[1:49:39] Fwonks: the raids were great in tbc tho
[1:49:41] Yvernaa: Cata, MoP and Legion were better than TBC tho
[1:49:41] nsoriano13: What do you mean you didnt like the flying mounts? @Guzu
[1:49:42] siggysudzz: stop the cap we remember u thriving to get ur flying mount
[1:49:42] Bishox: omE
[1:49:44] SelWrynn: I think in TBC they should have never invented Arena and built out BGs as the rated PvP system
[1:49:45] cookie_jayy: TRUE
[1:49:46] Chlamydious: COPIUM prove it
[1:49:46] Nomsinn: @mala_okolicka you only want cata Moodge
[1:49:46] dueporti: arena is mid and boring as heck but the rest  of the game is good
[1:49:50] paco__gutierrez: Retail is hot dogshit
[1:49:51] Asmii: Legion was best expansion
[1:49:51] Tropicocity: factual fact mhm

[1:50:45] Bishox: Aware  infinite loop

[1:51:00] inst1nctCS: 6 years a cycle kekw
[1:51:03] Yvernaa: They will do it until classic War Within 100%
[1:51:03] Asmii: Not even they know LULW
[1:51:08] foxxbraid: Yeah Classic Retail
[1:51:09] Bishox: they are gonna stop at wod for sure
[1:51:10] nsoriano13: I can never tell when Azamous is joking and serious. This is a satire video right? @Guzu
[1:51:10] BALtaram: I wish we get WOD classic imNOTcrying
[1:51:10] Chlamydious: Classic WoD POGGIES

[1:51:24] LabyrinthMW: Were would you go from Sunwell in TBC though @Guzu
[1:51:27] NUMYUMMY12: add runecrafting to classic WoW
[1:51:28] LabyrinthMW: Like the story is finished
[1:51:33] LabyrinthMW: You'd have to make up more story
[1:51:33] Horfent: i wouldnt mind them going through the expansions again, kinda missing Legion still
[1:51:34] sircrumpler: I think 3 year cycles would go hard. People like that progression from vanilla through wrath. I loved playing the same warlock from vanilla classic launch in 2019 til arthas
[1:51:39] Fennell16: Guzu! You're finally back From LA!!! How was the trip?
[1:51:42] Rahmulous: Pure vanilla feels like shit now without rune powers.
[1:51:44] ralphh1541: SoD/Classic+ is the future I think
[1:51:45] Zarkawii: is there really any evidence this would be a better decision for blizzard to make money? I cannot possibly imagine a repeating cycle of vanilla-wrath being more profitable than just continuing classic
[1:51:46] boldpotato2: da worl buffs
[1:51:50] Chlamydious: I was afk for a while, did i miss Mordiell showing us the engagement ring?
[1:51:51] nsoriano13: Yeah not true
[1:51:52] Yvernaa: Stopping at Classic Legion would be the play, nothing after that was great really
[1:51:53] mlady_telegramz97: true
[1:51:53] Myrror: You think that sod is a testing ground to release cut content for future classic expansions?
[1:51:56] monkaToSser: you do YEP
[1:51:56] AllVirtuall: Kel'Danas <3
[1:51:58] Daftducky: I miss playing Ele Sham in TBC
[1:52:00] CamGG__: @Chlamydious guzu showed it yes
[1:52:01] nsoriano13: You have SOD, HC/SF, Retail
[1:52:03] azshare_: dude hes so dramatic
[1:52:09] Genghish: Conserve TBC > progress to Cata
[1:52:10] TMMOOF: as soon as cata was announced, all my friends quit Wrath
[1:52:16] Nomsinn: WAYTOODANK
[1:52:20] Bishox: RETAIL

[1:52:22] Djinx_o: TBC SoD
[1:52:23] cookie_jayy: they should just make retail good
[1:52:23] Huntenn: Some might even say, theres never been more options of what to play
[1:52:26] Bishox: WAYTOODANK
[1:52:27] Vio9: not giving options just makes people quit for private servers though Shrugeg
[1:52:27] mlady_telegramz97: WAYTOODANK
[1:52:27] Nomsinn: self found hc for each expaqnsion
[1:52:29] mala_okolicka: only keep cata OkayMan
[1:52:31] johnboy1012: do them all but limit the servers
[1:52:32] bionix1337: Wrath SOD Pog
[1:52:33] Nikoftz27: WE ARE GONNA SHADOWLANDS CLASSIC SOON omE
[1:52:33] ozzyboy99: thats why they shouldnt have continued with doing cata
[1:52:34] GHOST97915: @Guzu there's no way support could keep up with maintenance on that many servers
[1:52:35] Nomsinn: 50 options and dead servers
[1:52:35] nsoriano13: I think MoP was best expansion. Please change my mind @Guzu
[1:52:37] Djinx_o: Wrath SoD
[1:52:40] ozzyboy99: just stay with the first three
[1:52:44] ohlolol2: TBC SOD

[1:52:46] SirHeiska: 1 server each

[1:52:48] inst1nctCS: is someone really playing retail? like almost all my friends rend on retail
[1:52:50] Chlamydious: @nsoriano13 MOP = BiS
[1:52:53] drakkir: rescale tbc+wrath to just lv 60, never increase levelcap
[1:52:54] StreamElements: Subscribe to the new Youtube for MORE Content!: https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2 !

[1:52:58] Yvernaa: TBC SoD sounds weird for some reason
[1:53:05] Bishox: @GHOST97915 WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? its 0 maintenance lol its era servers
