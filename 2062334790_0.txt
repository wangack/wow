[1:54:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I was wondering that about the trap launcher, like if that is a big tradeoff
[1:55:01] Anhak: nik we have too many melee
[1:56:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's been a long time since I played a hunter with viper stuff and I seem to recall having to go into that pretty often, losing damage
[1:56:43] nikthevoker: you get quiver

[3:01:26] Itankarenas: "fired"
[3:01:33] Itankarenas: they didn't have one
[3:01:37] Itankarenas: they just pretend the ydid
[3:01:42] Jingleskappa: I made a ticket and got an auto response 7 times
[3:01:51] Itankarenas: I remember back in cata the CS team worked
[3:01:54] nikthevoker: i love these 0-6 locks using seduce cheese only way to win LUL
[3:02:00] Itankarenas: they resolved a few of my problems
[3:02:04] Anhak: use to have a decent support team
[3:02:18] waitimdesyncd: They bugged out my titles a month ago, and everytime I login on a char it says "you lost the title [insert all my nice titles]" and they wont do anything :L
[3:02:18] nikthevoker: ya no melee can kick seduce
[3:02:19] Jingleskappa: you used to be able to live chat kek
[3:02:24] nikthevoker: and they cant do any dam
[3:02:30] Itankarenas: proba after mop. around when I stopped playing
[3:02:43] Anhak: i think it was mop like right after the reckful ban is when it started
[3:02:48] Itankarenas: I stopped midway through the xpac after mop
[3:02:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: That title thing happens to me too, they probably know about it
[3:03:05] Anhak: was it wod okay
[3:03:06] nikthevoker: fuckin dude whispering me "go miss rank 1" LUL b/c we told him to stop using seduce
[3:03:24] Itankarenas: @nikthevoker imagine using seduce as lock
[3:03:44] Itankarenas: actually trash in 2s or shuffle
[3:03:50] Itankarenas: 3s*
[3:03:54] Itankarenas: 2s also tho
[3:03:56] DontDv8: i remember in mop you could cs chat and get inactive player names free'd up so you could take them in like 5 mins
[3:04:07] nikthevoker: using it, and using it well completely dif things LUL
[3:04:22] Itankarenas: even using it well is hard af
[3:04:37] Itankarenas: it's basically not worth using
[3:04:50] nikthevoker: bleeds work tho
[3:04:55] nikthevoker: so thats good
[3:05:29] Itankarenas: I mean... edge case af tho tbh
[3:05:32] DontDv8: as a retail-only andy here, is sod worth playing? never played any classic
[3:06:13] Itankarenas: @DontDv8 they are very different games. SoD is about gear progression and leveling, whereas retail is about engame
[3:06:20] DontDv8: i heal so solo are insta for me xD
[3:06:22] Itankarenas: I play both tbh
[3:06:50] Itankarenas: Yeah, SoD is not time intensive at all
[3:06:59] DontDv8: doesnt it take forever to max level tho?
[3:07:12] Itankarenas: raid once a week at 40 bracket. at most, you raid like 2 times a a week at 60
[3:07:26] avenueone: once every 3 days next week

[3:07:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is an exp buff to help people catch up, it runs until level 25 currently
[3:07:42] nikthevoker: its all mechanics atm basically
[3:07:46] Anhak: the only nerf i wanna see is armor changed from 2x to 1.5 x on the mech
[3:07:47] Itankarenas: I played on turtle wow pserver and it was a lot of fun. as both mage and ret. didn;t need to raid any more than that
[3:08:10] DontDv8: sorry if you said anything about sod i missed it lol ad sniped me
[3:08:15] Anhak: i mean A MELEE HUNTER ALMOST 1 SHOT AVE
[3:08:29] Itankarenas: melee hunters seem strong af
[3:09:00] DontDv8: how long would it take to get to 40?
[3:09:23] DontDv8: ahhh
[3:09:24] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:09:28] DontDv8: thats not bad
[3:09:44] eMBeaR64oz: @notmes remind rainbow to bfd if she feels up to it for xp
[3:10:01] DontDv8: is it all pve or is there pvp?
[3:10:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yes there is PvP
[3:10:41] DontDv8: there is no arenas tho right?
[3:11:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Retail is way more balanced, true
[3:11:35] Itankarenas: yeah, retail doesn't give a fuuuuck about leveling or pve and pvp
[3:13:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the PvP weapons are badass
[3:13:13] eMBeaR64oz: sod pvp doesnt really feel like pvp tho
[3:13:17] Itankarenas: that's classic in a nutshell tbh
[3:13:21] eMBeaR64oz: its just a bunch of one shots and unhealable zerging
[3:13:37] Itankarenas: "you want pvp gear? cool. do pve. you want pve gear? how about some pvp for you?

[3:14:52] Anhak: there is overlap and it makes the whole game feel like a whole
[3:15:06] Itankarenas: yeah, idk if it’s good or bad, but that’s how classic works
[3:15:31] Borngood: idk if I could do something like 5 mask visions before I could arena every week bro
[3:15:34] brindleindle: Isnt that how it kind of worked for SL? you had to pvp to get the best trinkets for pve?
[3:15:44] Itankarenas: Just Itank is fine btw. that’s what everyone calls me. if you can remember me that is
[3:15:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those poor PvE people that want to stand in one place and autoattack will be murdered LUL
[3:16:07] nikthevoker: what profs are you going for crafted stuff
[3:17:07] Itankarenas: I thincthey thought that the game was so big that it would grow on its own tbh
[3:17:08] Borngood: KEKW
[3:17:13] Itankarenas: think they*
[3:17:23] Borngood: I did yeah but casually
[3:17:59] Itankarenas: I started playing end of bc and I remember people talking about how huge the game was and how it was growing. there wasn’t a rift between
[3:18:12] Itankarenas: pvp and pve either. they were the same endgame
[3:18:41] Borngood: maybe something between 100 get'iku runs from bfa and what we have now
[3:18:44] Anhak: i love pvping in classic unless its a boomkin in sod fuck boomkins
[3:18:54] Borngood: running 100 dungeons before you can arena suckjs
[3:18:55] iggy_pls: shuffle is a toxic wasteland
[3:19:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I agree  there is definitely room in the game for healthy optional overlap, giving people good reasons to do the other content without forcing it
[3:19:25] nikthevoker: SL made me want to pvp
[3:19:34] Itankarenas: I would disagree about shuffle tho. I think way more people will play a solo queue format than 3s
[3:19:40] nikthevoker: you need the lobby dog to sniff out them landminds
[3:19:57] nikthevoker: mines
[3:20:04] Itankarenas: people might quit, but if they only have 3s, they won’t even start imo
[3:20:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: That mythic+ stuff can be incredibly toxic for PvPers that don't know all the dungeons and systems
[3:20:47] Itankarenas: 3s is a MASSIVE fucking hill to climb. people have insane anxiety for pvp imo
[3:20:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it can be improved to help people transition
[3:21:17] Itankarenas: I disagree. I thing raiding is way easier to get into because of the number of players
[3:21:36] privategravy: Yeah ppl were like keyboard turning at 1800 lol
[3:21:37] nikthevoker: i literally had to buy pve carrys to prove myself to push top10 LUL
[3:21:39] Itankarenas: yes, but the average level has gone up, making the barrier to entry higher
[3:21:40] Anhak: there are people who clear mythic raids and get rank 1 m+ and probably rank 1 pvpers that you dont know about that are clickers
[3:22:08] tirixy: i was keyboard turning at 2200
[3:22:36] privategravy: now trying to get 1600 token on an alt is actually a huge chore
[3:22:45] Anhak: the avg is gonna start going down cause we got people like chuck and mes and myself and many others knocking on deaths door and reaction times door..
[3:22:47] Borngood: im on the camp without shuffle, m+ completely cannibalized the pvp playerbase it was over
[3:22:53] privategravy: Like imagine being a new player and not even being able to get 1690
[3:23:02] brindleindle: exactly, finding people in lfg for 3s is so hard without a glad title it seems
[3:23:05] privategravy: I would hate pvp if this was my first season learning
[3:23:49] sunileif: the season of convoke?
[3:23:50] Itankarenas: hmm… I won’t say you’re wrong, but I would also disagree that everyone even WANTS to do 3s over shuffle
[3:25:04] crusadein: most ppl i know and talk to only really shuffle when they dont have a 3s team.
[3:25:14] unkle420: 3 rets that was fun
[3:25:18] Itankarenas: tbh, in the past when I had more time, I was more interested in 3s, but now I have almost no interest in it because I have other things to do
[3:25:27] muhfin: i quit that season cuz of the ret bs
[3:25:31] muhfin: left it busted for so long lol
[3:25:34] nikthevoker: or 4
[3:26:01] Itankarenas: As a healer, I could see shuffle as not as much fun, but as dps, it all evens out in the end to me
[3:26:13] Borngood: I really believe that's 4 more rounds the average player would play at all, I don't see them stepping into normal arenas
[3:26:30] privategravy: I have glad xp and cant find 3s on my alts, the game had like 9 active Arena LFG at a time @brindleindle
[3:26:45] Itankarenas: Also, holy fuck, typing on my phone is so unenjoyable KEKW
[3:27:19] FoxiekittenWoW: you really think so?
[3:27:23] Borngood: they could try axeing shuffle for 1 season to see
[3:27:23] waitimdesyncd: There are 8 Teams in the LFG rn. 8 out of 8 are 2s groups
[3:27:25] Borngood: only way to see
[3:27:29] Itankarenas: I don't play competitive, but I love watching it, and to ME, shuffle is the best thing that ever happened to pvp
[3:27:38] Itankarenas: for casual players
[3:27:47] DontDv8: lol sick gameplay
[3:27:51] Borngood: but like 30 min queues over none, im not convinced
[3:28:13] muhfin: i personally love shuffle
[3:28:15] nikthevoker: i would of quit without shuffle
[3:28:17] muhfin: only thing i do on retail
[3:28:23] Itankarenas: I think you underestimate the queue anxiety
[3:28:38] nikthevoker: or id be a pve er again
[3:28:40] Borngood: People behave differently now, they won't group up for regular 3s
[3:28:42] Itankarenas: I think shuffle makes 3s way more accessible to people than you think
[3:28:42] Borngood: they just wont man
[3:28:53] DoubleFreakTV: But same time, being able to Q solo to get into a solid pvp lobby, is very valueable for casuals. Q times are another question, gotta make people want to play healer
[3:29:07] Itankarenas: people will not queue 3s
[3:29:09] Itankarenas: Adge

[3:29:35] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:29:44] Borngood: I would love if that's the case if they did, axe shuffle and everyone made 3s groups instead, just dont see it
[3:29:46] Itankarenas: My sub ran out Smadge
[3:30:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: For PvE the split has pretty much always been about 70% DPS, 20% healers and 10% tanks
[3:30:27] Itankarenas: I am so confident that that wouldn't work that I would bet my next 10 years of salary on it
[3:30:36] Itankarenas: @Borngood
[3:31:08] privategravy: healing is in a very stressful time to be fair
[3:31:34] Itankarenas: also, they changed healing DRAMATICALLY
[3:31:40] Itankarenas: I think it turns the casual player off
[3:31:43] privategravy: I legit had someone die 60-0 in half a second
[3:31:59] Itankarenas: you have to understand cds well to be able to do it, whereas before, you didn't
[3:32:05] Itankarenas: back from Adge
[3:32:39] Itankarenas: I mained hpally for 5 years from cata and coming back to the current healing system it felt super fucking weird
[3:32:46] Itankarenas: incredibly weak outsided of cds
[3:32:53] Itankarenas: it's really uninviting
[3:33:03] privategravy: yeah
[3:33:14] JSjoestroem: ye, healing rn
[3:33:17] JSjoestroem: is pure aids
[3:33:24] sunileif: hpal is shit rn
[3:33:26] Itankarenas: I think wow is in a great spot right now in terms of gameplay, but there are spots it could definitely improve on for casuals/ new players
[3:33:33] Anhak: Kermit: TONIGHT WE FEAST ON ALLIANCE BLOOD. IN HONOR OF MES
[3:33:46] eMBeaR64oz: mes, 4 mage 1 priest group is the meta for sod btw
[3:33:48] eMBeaR64oz: this is nuts
[3:34:01] Itankarenas: I started again for the first time in DF S3 after a 6-7 year hiatus and I'm loving it, but I could see what people might not like
[3:34:02] sunileif: need to give rogue and dh a 20% burst reduction
[3:34:21] bigbadweasel7: whats ur gear?
[3:34:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: The queue times of shuffle make me keep thinking of adding AI healers into the lobbies
[3:34:57] Itankarenas: I have the total opposite thought process. What else is there? is my thought
[3:35:11] Itankarenas: 3s, which has a massive barrier to entry
[3:35:30] sunileif: adding lfr pvp like solo q dilutes the active pool of players
[3:36:06] Itankarenas: people want to feel the competitiveness of 3s, without having to find 2 other people 2 queue with without getting flamed
[3:36:19] Itankarenas: is my understanding at least
[3:36:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, the game could make suggestions
[3:36:39] Itankarenas: if you read reddit, that's what I gelean
[3:36:42] Anhak: Kermit: Another one bites the dust
[3:36:44] Itankarenas: glean*
[3:36:52] Borngood: wasnt shadowlands season 1 covid or nah
[3:36:57] Itankarenas: because people are really causal based on what posts they like and dislike
[3:37:10] Icouldbegood: kermit kinda sounds like Trill ngl no flame ofc
[3:37:35] sunileif: anhak use the odie voice from now on
[3:37:51] Borngood: think ladder activity with shuffle and arena combined right now when they increased mmr those couple weeks was the same as shadowlands, thats what I heard
[3:37:58] wowsuomi: Ilove playing when theres easy rating from so many players
[3:38:15] privategravy: bajheera talks about that exact idea a lot
[3:38:24] Itankarenas: So I didn’t play SL at all. how was the pvp system then different from how it is now?
[3:38:24] privategravy: making pvers do pvp is super healthy
[3:38:43] Borngood: yeah once the mmr increases stopped ladder activity stopped
[3:38:48] Borngood: completely
[3:39:07] Borngood: I checked yeah it was due to the mmr its funny
[3:39:17] strungeee: people are just playing sod right?
[3:39:17] Rakschas: Hi Mes, first time chatter here. Did you have a chance to raid Gnomer as hunter yet and did you like it?
[3:39:20] Borngood: it is yeah
[3:39:33] Itankarenas: yeah mmr injection is 100% broken system. I agree with that
[3:39:46] Itankarenas: it never happened in the past
[3:39:55] luckydyldo: well thats what most of the casual community complains about and wants thats the problem
[3:40:06] Itankarenas: it’s a solution to a system that has a wildly unpredictable playerbase
[3:40:25] DontDv8: hasnt there always been mmr injection?
[3:40:34] Itankarenas: it’s a “solution”
[3:40:40] wowsuomi: Compair mmr in season 8 to mid wod haha
[3:41:09] DontDv8: wasnt wod mmr like 3.7k or some shit
[3:41:14] Itankarenas: 13 was cata s1?
[3:41:36] Itankarenas: feral was laggy all fucking xpac, but yeah
[3:41:42] FoxiekittenWoW: season 9 was cata s 1
[3:42:30] FoxiekittenWoW: they did the worst thing they have ever done in season 10
[3:42:31] Itankarenas: reckful 3k. great video
[3:42:44] Itankarenas: yeah, pvp was not balanced at all back fhen
[3:43:04] FoxiekittenWoW: they resat mmr after 3 weeks of season 10 and you could never reach the teams who played before the reset
[3:43:53] Anhak: wow started with decay in vanilla but that same system also had inflation

[3:44:44] Itankarenas: shuffle is good, but player base is almost always wrong imo
[3:44:44] FoxiekittenWoW: they should just make the rating system like leagues
[3:45:10] wowsuomi: How to rate ppl off %
[3:45:10] FoxiekittenWoW: with divisions based on % of players in a certain bracket
[3:45:39] Anhak: Kermit: To quote the great. Jay. Allan. Brack. You think you do but you dont
[3:45:51] luckydyldo: they wont care as long as they can get the 2400 glad title
[3:45:59] Itankarenas: I said this years ago and people were like "NO IT'S BLIZZARD NOT LISTENING TO US. THAT'S WHY THE GAME SUCKS."  just kept saying "sure bud"
[3:46:16] adventxcloud: adventxcloud subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! Legendary check
[3:46:16] StreamElements: adventxcloud just subscribed for 37 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[3:46:16] Borngood: yeah most ppl wont care they play for rewards based on the static number based cutoffs like 1800 etc
[3:46:33] DontDv8: tbh i feel like most average players pvp for cosmetics, where glads pvp for top of the ladder
[3:46:44] Anhak: i feel so bad for him.. everyone inside the company says hes a good guy. but as players thats all we remember
[3:46:48] adventxcloud: wait
[3:46:52] adventxcloud: there's a drunk stream goal
[3:46:55] Itankarenas: good conversation to have tho. this is the shit wow needs
[3:47:56] Itankarenas: @adventxcloud are you not drunk? EZ WineTime
[3:48:25] DontDv8: tbh i fell like a battle pass system for pvp/pve would be good too
[3:48:25] FoxiekittenWoW: what do you think about implementing a similar system like what league of legends have?
[3:48:28] Itankarenas: today ends in "y." that means it's a drinking day
[3:48:30] FoxiekittenWoW: with divisions
[3:48:47] wowsuomi: The catch up in mop was alright but could of been better
[3:49:08] adventxcloud: 5 games now
[3:49:09] Itankarenas: I wonder if divisons would be good for wow. they do incentivize progress more I think
[3:49:12] adventxcloud: for provisionals
[3:49:25] FoxiekittenWoW: they do have that, but in wow its set in ratings while in league its based of % in that division
[3:49:34] Itankarenas: you can feel progress more with divisions
[3:49:43] Itankarenas: but It might also make people feel worse
[3:49:43] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:49:50] Itankarenas: idk the data tbh
[3:50:07] FoxiekittenWoW: yea would be perfect
[3:50:09] wowsuomi: The conquest cap only half of it rolled over everyweek not all like in retail these days
[3:50:31] Itankarenas: the average players is really bad, and no one wants to see silver or bronze, so it might be worse
[3:50:32] DontDv8: i like a rank number better than a rating value
[3:50:34] Itankarenas: idk tho
[3:51:02] Itankarenas: if max rating is 5k, 2.9k is fuck all

[3:51:39] Itankarenas: idk
[3:51:40] FoxiekittenWoW: yea i feel like people have such a hard time understanding the concept of inflation and what ratings reflect in different seeason
[3:51:53] Itankarenas: HeyGuys
[3:52:24] wowsuomi: Im sure if the devs could of changed rating to percent based and it being better they would of done it by now
[3:52:46] Itankarenas: could have*
[3:52:55] Itankarenas: would have*
[3:53:08] Itankarenas: I don't wanna be that guy, but it is physically painful

[11:09:03] sunileif: all of sl
[11:09:08] Banzeye95: whatever is fotm is what he chooses as his opinion
[11:09:31] swolecolemole: yea that's some wise words right there
[11:09:40] Wrathbb1: thats why you gotta take a dump on other IPs while you praise your IP
[11:10:00] sunileif: @Wrathbb1 didnt blizz do that with bg3?
[11:10:11] Banzeye95: yeah but, don't you watch content to learn things about the game or even the politics of the game objectively - not to receive the same information u get in twitch
[11:10:13] Wrathbb1: yeah he is super positive right now on the lore and stuff
[11:10:48] vuldronx: hopium alert here, but looking at the san'layn tree, there is no mention of festering wounds and the tree heavly encourage scourge strike spam over using festering strike. Mabye we see a DK rework with no wounds before war within

[11:16:27] Banzeye95: cant deny the record retention of players either lol
[11:16:37] Banzeye95: DF has retained more of its subs than other expansions
[11:16:55] Blitzylive: game is dead i agree is an exaggeration and new patches new expansion come and people come back.
[11:17:14] Blitzylive: but in general there are a lot less people playing the game now then say Lich King era
[11:17:19] Wrathbb1: @Blitzylive there is also less interest in MMOs than there was 20 years ago.
[11:17:39] Banzeye95: that's not a take on modern wow or opinions of new expansions tho
[11:17:43] Wrathbb1: people used to play MMOs simply cause it was all their friends played, I think that happens a LOT less now

[11:18:41] waitimdesyncd: now wow is a esport everywhere
[11:18:41] chiseledbrain: world of warcrack never dying
[11:18:45] Wrathbb1: @waitimdesyncd true
[11:18:49] Blitzylive: but the numbers keep dipping. Blizzard at one point had 12 million subs. We are now at 4-5 million
[11:18:51] Blitzylive: that's huge
[11:19:02] c0jaK: if we lose the people complaining about dead game then i'd be concerned
[11:19:10] Banzeye95: gaming is vastly different now though too
[11:19:28] Banzeye95: access to games and different genres is way easier than a decade ago (wrath)
[11:19:33] Cocoapuffs1: didnt they lose half their subs after wod came out? when china was still playing
[11:19:40] Cocoapuffs1: 12m- 6m
[11:19:51] Wrathbb1: @Cocoapuffs1 they lost me til DF with WoD
[11:19:57] Cocoapuffs1: They stopped announcing numbers during wod
[11:20:17] Blitzylive: drop in subs also meant blizzard cut costs on things so they now reuse a lot of content and skins
[11:20:32] Blitzylive: hence recolored gear and the whole "classic" re use
[11:20:37] Banzeye95: it was cos of skeletons wasnt it or something? same with shadowlands, they couldnt mention death etc
[11:20:45] chiseledbrain: thought wow is giga huge in china is that cap
[11:21:21] Wrathbb1: fallout 3
[11:21:28] Wrathbb1: GTA iv
[11:21:51] Wrathbb1: yeah MMOs are dead compared to what they were
[11:21:57] Banzeye95: harry potter + LOTR same era
[11:22:00] Blitzylive: wow peaked in 2010
[11:22:01] Banzeye95: heavily influenced mmos
[11:22:17] yepx1: market crash
[11:22:34] Wrathbb1: @yepx1 true
[11:22:50] Wrathbb1: 2009 was the height of the recession
[11:23:04] Cocoapuffs1: lmao yeah 2009 games so bad lookin at them now

[11:24:17] wowsuomi: I was playing RSin 09 and wrath on the side
[11:24:42] Razdruid: a lot of FF players from FF11 online went to wow in BC because of a content drought back in 2008ish
[11:25:08] Wrathbb1: I would love a version of wow that basically copies Runescape Deadman servers
[11:25:11] wowsuomi: Fear of mining out haha
[11:25:20] wowsuomi: Missing*
[11:25:23] chiseledbrain: wows peak is incoming over next 3 expansions CoolCat

[11:26:26] Razdruid: and a fraction of the time too
[11:26:32] yepx1: My stepdad runs an ecommerce website for a fortune 500 company and he uses AI to program it, then programmers scrub it
[11:26:34] Abruaz: the future with AI and jobs is being REALLY good at knowing how to utilize all the different AI's and make them work together if needed
[11:26:40] Abruaz: I notice that in my industry for sure
[11:26:42] Wrathbb1: but wouldn't you need to actually have an in-house offline AI in order to do that securely?
[11:26:50] Razdruid: time is a big factor in both quality and content for a game
[11:26:59] Wrathbb1: if you use someone else's AI there is now way to be sure they are not illegally stealing your work
[11:27:46] wowsuomi: I hasen't been done before
[11:27:54] Razdruid: where is isaac asminov when we need him
[11:27:55] Wrathbb1: like Amazon. They let you make a store on their website then retro engineer your product and make a cheaper version under the Amazon Essential brand
[11:28:08] Dreadrend: I have 1 game I'm more hyped for than any and it's sparking zero
