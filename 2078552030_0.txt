[0:09:13] GrimFandango: There's another simultaneous Twitter discussion today about how M+ should never grant Myth track gear. Twitter today is insane
[0:09:15] alarkin: I actually agree with him, Fated is just awful - I know my guild has no interest in it at all

[0:38:30] jjwallababy: and it hasnt been by cutting carbs
[0:38:31] Ashille: that's so wrong
[0:38:31] obe_one: Thats why you eat a lot of fat in your diet. Your body will source that.
