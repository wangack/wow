[1:13:29] ItsBees: baking soda and vinegar is a good combo for cleaning
[1:13:34] rissel: sweeteners that doesnt dissolve and destory your micro biom tho?
[1:13:48] JustTaki: Cool didn't know it could be used that way
[1:13:51] Luigicamp: you can also clean stuff up with any soda water too. Somehow people are fixated on coca cola
[1:13:53] nikthevoker: it cleas your battery spotless
[1:13:53] firststagepizza: yeah we use some vinegar too
[1:13:56] Bonegraft: diet soda is healthy for you
[1:13:57] nikthevoker: cleans
[1:14:08] Schwenkyytv: everything is bad for you now a days
[1:14:26] zachgamegodx: you’re literally playing a fury warrior telling people to drink a couple sodas rofl
[1:14:26] neoxue: Bad shit is okay in moderation.
[1:14:32] ZealotryTV: thats because people dont know moderation anymore
[1:14:35] Skompa: @not_couch Thank you! Is BG best way to gain honor? Yeah maybe we could play some later! :)
[1:14:39] ramenxo: soda pretty objectively horrible for u

[1:15:36] Deyconn: you can live life perfectly other wise its boring af
[1:15:40] Distwrought: I'm here for a good time, not a long time
[1:15:41] SweatyDaniels: hasnt diet coke been linked to brain cancer or is that influencer jargon
[1:15:42] ramenxo: i drink sweet tea pretty fucking awful for u as well generally but whats the point of life if u cant enjoy overly sugary beverages
[1:15:43] Deyconn: do what you want cause your gonna die anyways
[1:15:49] not_couch: @Skompa probably spam some BGs to get started
[1:15:52] addyz0r: anecdotally i personally notice when my fat intake goes over at certain level, i feel worse than with sugar.
[1:15:54] Luigicamp: yeah another reason I stay away from short videos, so many are about "self-taught' experts who probably didn't go beyond high school.
[1:16:03] ItsBees: @SweatyDaniels influencer jargon, you'd have to drink like 700 a day for it to start to be harmful
[1:16:04] Skompa: @not_couch alright, tyvm!!
[1:16:09] soddi: getting old is linked to cancer xdd
[1:16:15] Bluguieghe: you need a shitload of aspartam to actually be a problem from what i understand

[1:16:29] Luigicamp: lmao
[1:16:37] Yamikix: Well Buffett drinks every day, he seems fine xD
[1:16:42] ramenxo: "i smoked 5 cigarettes a day and drank a doctor pepper every day"
[1:16:44] ramenxo: like...?
[1:16:45] cruelhabbitts: my grandma been smoking cigarettes for over 60 years, she’s now 92 and well
[1:16:47] ZealotryTV: did you know if you take like 13 tylenol it will probably be your last headache?
[1:16:48] not_couch: i just remember the 103 year old lady saying that coors light kept her young lol
[1:17:03] Wretchedd: They also lived in a different time with 0 preservatives and processed shit
[1:17:21] What_ln_Tarnation: genetics is more important than eating perfect
[1:17:27] shivwren: Venruki is the kind of guy that believes in a healthy balanced lifestyle, but still ocassionally plays punchmonk
[1:17:32] ItsBees: https://youtu.be/-KG912GXSaI?si=luK4omGF37JQ1nE7&t=39 This lady's comment LUL
[1:17:33] soddi: yeah stress and inflammation are the worst, the rest is peanuts
[1:17:55] Telarius1: @not_couch Those cases are always confirmation Bias, you only hear about the ones who survived, cuz they're amazing. You dont hear from all the people who die, cuz they dead.
[1:17:57] Luigicamp: my dad drinks a glass of wine with every meal every day, and he's 93. Now they say alcohol, even in small amounts, is bad for you...
[1:18:02] Slayer_Eagleone: 3 DR PEPPERS??!
[1:18:06] ItsBees: gotta rewind haha
[1:18:11] ItsBees: at 39 seconds

[1:18:25] macdeezyx: low stress and a healthy weight are more important than most things
[1:18:36] Wretchedd: Forest Gump
[1:18:47] zachgamegodx: I feel like this stream is borderline a political station
[1:18:47] cyborg1141: I drink moonshine out of a green beans can, it's great for you.
[1:18:50] Cocoapuffs1: 3 dr peppers a day. got it
[1:18:50] soddi: brb, buying dr pepper
[1:18:54] ZealotryTV: thats awesome
[1:18:55] ItsBees: she said " I've had two doctors tell me if I keep drinking this I'll die, but they died first"
[1:19:03] Schwenkyytv: she says that the doctors told her to stop dinking it that she lived longer than them lol
[1:19:09] Schwenkyytv: haha
[1:19:09] addyz0r: @ItsBees fucking owned xD
[1:19:21] kaanilami: what time do you have in america? its 18:42 here thats 6pm i think
[1:19:25] drumminbacon: every season there’s something that everyone plays and is good
[1:19:42] ItsBees: @kaanilami it's 11:42am for me
[1:19:43] drumminbacon: ret in season 1, augvoker in season 2 and havoc now
[1:19:47] not_couch: 12:42 midwest
[1:20:08] ramenxo: this is real season 3 solo shuffle right here dh in lobby trinket blurring opener and doing double everyones damage
[1:20:22] zachgamegodx: fist weaver with no sanc/freedom or intervene is honestly garbage anyone who thinks otherwise is trolling
[1:20:24] kaanilami: nice to know that i live in the future :O
[1:20:34] lilcoooooom: havoc was crazy beginnin of seas 1 too
[1:20:49] ramenxo: yes, it was. no one remembers but havoc dh had to eat about 5 nerfs beginning of s1
[1:21:14] lilcoooooom: i member
[1:21:53] Telarius1: @ramenxo ya it got nerfed until it was 3rd least played melee the next seas
[1:22:06] nameyourform: LMFAO
[1:22:12] lilcoooooom: terlarius u dirty dh propogandist
[1:22:17] cruelhabbitts: Kappa
[1:22:31] AblazeING: Could you please link your warriors build?
[1:22:41] frazzoqt: So sad we cant take spear on warr :<
[1:22:48] ramenxo: they were bad for like tail end of season 1
[1:22:55] kritikos5: s2 they weren't bad, moreso just meh
[1:23:00] redsalem: Very beginning when they got turbo nerfed outta pre patch
[1:23:04] ramenxo: the state of dh atm is inexcusable
[1:23:12] meglo748: why dont we see them much in NA awc? DHs
[1:23:43] Judgejobrown: hunter going straight to r/worldofpvp with that oneshot
[1:23:54] zachgamegodx: @ramenxo I mean they were very easy to nerf bc fundamentally they were the same as they always were with broken dmg, the rework gave them things that makes them powerful outside of dmg, such as baseline demonic appetite,  a pathway to netherwalk that doesn’t cost dmg (before they had to give up a ton of dmg for nether) and increased physical/magic dmg reduction built into spec
[1:23:58] ramenxo: bc its toolkit is overpowered
[1:24:14] Nateypww: I remember they were really good start of season 1 and then got nerfed into the ground
[1:24:18] ramenxo: if you look at dh toolkit objectively it doesnt make sense in retail wow compared to every other class, sometimes they are just tuned poorly
[1:24:26] massiveshade: s2 they were average, but they were op most of s1 and current season
[1:24:47] zerx_gg: maybe dh is the only class that makes sense retailwise PauseChamp

[1:25:43] likeewlock: DH should die like aff compared to that dmg
[1:25:52] Blitzylive: lol
[1:25:53] Judgejobrown: stayingh feign death KEKW
[1:25:58] isomething: hahahah
[1:26:01] Blitzylive: I love him
[1:26:15] Blitzylive: dedicated to the feign death
[1:26:39] zachgamegodx: @telarius1 are you the guy who trolls ven on twitter
[1:26:42] zachgamegodx: the Tel guy
[1:27:04] macdeezyx: dh casually doing feral and fury dam combined
[1:27:08] zachgamegodx: dh wasn’t great last szn
[1:27:13] lilcoooooom: telarius is sick
[1:27:15] Telarius1: Its arenamate, if you wanna google it
[1:27:30] Telarius1: I only que shuf tbh
[1:27:40] zachgamegodx: it’s the passives they gave to dh this rework is what will make them strong regardless if they nerf dmg
[1:27:50] SweatyDaniels: nothing conclusive on Aspartame besides "possibly carcinogenic" , which FDA disagrees, but I can't ignore the fact that there is so much money in the sweetener industry that they could influence the politics. https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food
[1:28:08] Telarius1: ya cuz DH got a rework, and its overtuned rn despite 3 nerfs
[1:28:11] gothadult: is there any reason you don't compete in AWC?
[1:28:43] Telarius1: @zachgamegodx not true, ever in dh history
[1:28:57] Telarius1: the class is a damage bot
[1:28:57] CKBandit: DH only has 2 specs, so they have to be 1.5x stronger than other specs to balance
[1:28:57] DaneDillon: PogChamp
[1:29:04] zerx_gg: dont think its you lil bro
[1:29:05] zerx_gg: xdd
[1:29:10] likeewlock: make no sense
[1:29:16] ayosteviey: zACH WAS SAYING THE PASSIVE DMG IS WHAT MAKES IT SEEM HORRIBLE
[1:29:19] ayosteviey: caps sorrry
[1:29:35] Hobblefoot: Right.... Have any of you .... okay Ven stole my thunder. LOL
[1:29:46] Schwenkyytv: even salt and water is poisones if you consume to much of it
[1:29:57] ramenxo: dh players most cooked players in wow. p sure barndoor was in here wanting to put dh in C tier bc he died to a rogue once after trinket blurring a root.
[1:30:06] laternerd42069: All the food in the USA is meant to kill us so it is what it is
[1:30:15] LHermite: it doesnt have to give u cancer to be bad for u overall
[1:30:16] Telarius1: id say majority of dh players know dh is overtuned
[1:30:21] Telarius1: other than the rerollers
[1:30:24] lilcoooooom: telarius and barn are literally on 2 different tiers
[1:30:26] ayosteviey: You ever taste stevia? That aint stuff for our bodies
[1:30:30] Telarius1: but many dont understand why its broken rn
[1:30:32] ayosteviey: *aint
[1:30:54] toljar: We as a whole have been drinking the asper-sweet-goodness for 40+ years. So manu studies on it, and cancer rates have not been proven to increase or decrease from the consumption of it. Just more fear mongering just like MSG.
[1:31:13] massiveshade: dh being broken is the same reason as old as time
[1:31:17] ayosteviey: Wait what kind of sweetner proaganda is going on in this chat today
[1:31:19] vanlonja: @venruki they injected the amount of aspartame equal to 52 litres of aspartame swetened soda in mice all at once and then concluded it is possibly cancerogenic KEKW
[1:31:22] Bezoned: been trying to jump into pvp, bg's are truly terrible
[1:31:39] massiveshade: tons of damage, self-sustain/tankiness, cc, mobility
[1:31:40] toljar: just the typical hate on asp
[1:31:40] SweatyDaniels: yeah i wouldnt trust anything that comes from a WHO study either
[1:31:43] zachgamegodx: base demonic appetite(20% to spawn a fragment on chaos strike which heals for like 200k, previously a talent that you couldn’t take) + demon muzzle(5% physical reduction)  + free nether/desperate instincts + free 5% magic damage reduction + free 4% versatility (thru pathway talent) + passive 10% magic damage reduction—— a fire within + cleansed by flame invalidates damage from certain specs like frost mages, sps, destro locks, ele shamans
[1:31:45] Telarius1: people dont wanna remember, but seas 2 DF, DH was almost least played spec.
[1:32:05] Blitzylive: 100% cooked
[1:32:05] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:32:19] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: cooked indeed x0r6ztGiggle
[1:32:21] jayhovito: fury looks cracked when you play it
[1:32:22] Telarius1: since then ya
[1:32:39] ItsBees: still no boomkin rework Sadge
[1:32:40] zachgamegodx: they’re no longer dmg bots tel
[1:32:40] massiveshade: dh also were by far the most represented s1
[1:32:44] zachgamegodx: you just said they were
[1:32:48] likeewlock: so its now okay to be overtuned because season 2 ? :D
[1:32:58] driftwood_tc: Cries in feral, I miss the days when feral was kitty bleeds and not big burst.
[1:33:02] fugginhiding: maybe dh is their way of getting queues to pop more GalaxyUnpacked
[1:33:04] ayosteviey: DH apologizer
[1:33:08] Telarius1: well i only said that about DF seas 2, cuz people were talking about how it was OP all of DF
[1:33:13] SweatyDaniels: hot take, Joe Rogan should have Venruki on his podcast
[1:33:30] Zilesky: EASIEST WAY TO GET SPLINTERS ? \
[1:33:34] likeewlock: its like whole xpaxc
[1:33:36] Synckery: @Telarius1 maybe not all but 2/3rd of DF
[1:33:44] vanlonja: DH is the only thing keeping us from world of castercraft LUL
[1:33:54] toljar: Maybe people enjoy playing DH because they are stong and do not need 10000 buttons to be good like other classes. Too much button bloat is in WoW, sometimes I want to play a class I can smash buttons on and not have to track 30 different buffs and dots just to stay in a fight.
[1:34:09] driftwood_tc: @vanlonja warr, WW, rogue... what are you even on about buddy?
[1:34:13] Merkflare: :O
[1:34:19] zachgamegodx: you brought up s1 as if nerfing dh dmg will actually make them less op … I mean if you nerf every possible build by 20% maybe, even outlaw was crap when it did no dmg
[1:34:24] ayosteviey: @toljar My conspiracy on why they been OP is to make something easy for the gen pop
[1:34:39] zachgamegodx: but it’s in the same class as rogues to me now, they’d have to do very low dmg to not be good after the rework
[1:34:41] massiveshade: BFA was the last time we had a true caster pvp meta and that was only the 2nd half of the expac
[1:34:49] toljar: maybe, too many classes now days are discouraging to play once you deep dive them
[1:35:09] ayosteviey: Yeah too much CC from DH that has insance OT dmg and 100-0 burst
[1:35:26] Synckery: imagine the button bloat next xpac with hero talents Kappa
[1:35:27] Lamatastisch: 1-5 fpr the DH
[1:35:30] zachgamegodx: @massiveshade not true. Theres pockets of caster metas scattered throughout the timeline
[1:35:31] Lamatastisch: DH needs a buff
[1:35:32] DaneDillon: All day I have seen people say "well DH isn't as OP as ret was" or "DH was bad in the past" none of that matters... why would previous weakness mean it should be OP or why would it not being the most OP class ever mean it should be OP now? In my opinion, the game should be balanced around right now, not around some sense of it needing to be OP to balance that it was bad before.
[1:35:32] Schwenkyytv: dh winning 1 game, buff dh
[1:35:35] toljar: I would be fine with them removing the fear off DH - but them killing people and being too easy to play is needed in a class
[1:35:43] kazz_ret: good mornin ven
[1:35:46] zerx_gg: time to make dh a banned word
[1:35:57] driftwood_tc: Essaying
[1:35:59] ayosteviey: DH fear is just bonkers
[1:36:11] likeewlock: low effort class should not be rewarded
[1:36:22] moremantella255: out of spite blizz should buff dh next balance change KEKW
[1:36:24] artsz89: xdd
[1:36:33] gothadult: @likeewlock yeah, i'm tired of MVQ acting like he's doing something
[1:36:38] Nateypww: I feel like demon hunter isn’t as toxic as other classes when they’re OP
[1:36:43] Telarius1: its just the title cutoffs for all speecs
[1:36:43] massiveshade: @zachgamegodx caster with melee, melee cleave, or rogue takeover were far more meta. haven't seen a true double caster meta in a long time
[1:36:45] Telarius1: DH was lowest of all spec
[1:36:49] Telarius1: Cuz nobod yplayed it/did well
[1:37:07] Nateypww: like demo, UH dk, BM hunter
[1:37:12] massiveshade: @massiveshade there was even hpally/fist weave that helped their melee cleave train people
[1:37:13] zachgamegodx: i don’t want anything to change  until fears and roots break thresholds are reverted to their original value. fearing someone while attacking them 3 times should not be a viable strategy.
[1:37:14] SweatyDaniels: i actually find it impressive when im playing rdruid and a DH on a S1 DF glad mount completely picks apart my teams defensives and then kills me in 1 global as soon as my buttons have all been used
[1:37:24] SweatyDaniels: at 1800 cr solo
[1:37:25] redsalem: What's survival at just for giggles
[1:37:27] vodkacran: i finally decided to storm the ss as a healer and i'm in a 10 min queue :(
[1:37:49] zachgamegodx: until this is addressed I’ll play my double immo dispel  dh and shit on all the warlocks
[1:38:10] meglo748: DH feels like a entry spec which the game might need. i think its best when its best a lower rating but falls when you out play it at high rating
[1:38:21] FreddoB: I just think DH is a annoying class, double jumpnonsence
[1:38:25] nikthevoker: fear is a stun now
[1:38:34] Telarius1: i ate a bolt today and fear didnt break lmfao
[1:38:35] ramenxo: demo locks legit just killing ppl in fears
[1:38:36] Telarius1: on my prev
[1:38:36] ramenxo: idek
[1:38:38] redsalem: Fear matters
[1:38:50] redsalem: We just got used to it not mattering
[1:39:00] kazz_ret: needs to break after less damage
[1:39:14] Cocoapuffs1: also why is the threshold for breaking fears on dam so vague and not a set number or % we know it will break at
[1:39:20] nikthevoker: twitch is cooked you can say it LUL
[1:39:22] Synckery: feels like were in one of the worst metas of all time atm ngl
[1:39:23] massiveshade: fear has always been one of the strongest ccs, it just balanced around not being a dummy and breaking it
[1:39:51] massiveshade: like the people who break blind/incaps
[1:39:54] zachgamegodx: fury has a movement speed boost when it’s enraged so you can pick either
[1:39:54] toljar: Leech imo - most people "train the warrior"
[1:40:01] toljar: so you always have someone to hit
[1:40:12] dadb00dy: Well i gave arcane the good ol try but i suck so back to frost it is
[1:40:27] alucen: I just put in a request to delete my wow account, did 21 MILION more healing in a lobby vs a press evoker and still went 0-6

[1:40:37] vanlonja: They just need to give fear some DoT protection and just make direct damage break it. Everything else is just plain dumb.
[1:40:41] totez1432: leech is nerfed in PVP
[1:40:48] totez1432: its like half value
[1:41:08] zachgamegodx: @totez1432 don’t think so
[1:41:19] asenku11k: Yo yos
[1:41:23] meglo748: happens with affi lock all the time
[1:41:31] alucen: hpriest (me) ele sham, feral, moonkin arms and press
[1:41:35] Not_J_o_n: Tell that to the triple dh lobby kek
[1:41:43] gelatokush: some people use avoidance  cloak an avoidance bracers and spped on boots and if your a agi user u can use speed/agi chest and u still have 10% move speed + 5% avoidance
[1:41:48] phanabananana: dont tell nahj that lol
[1:41:55] asenku11k: wakin up rough, i ate too much last night
[1:42:03] zachgamegodx: I use speed on dh even cause the enchants give you a combined 2.1%
[1:42:06] moremantella255: w song
[1:42:18] lilcoooooom: hpriest is gud into pres
[1:42:23] alucen: I understand i`m bad but im consistently doing more healing than anyone I face and still I went like 0-6 4 lobs in a row, idk, this game is complete ass
[1:42:31] dmay93: recipe?
[1:42:37] zachgamegodx: 2.1% leech isn’t enough for me to not take 11% speed even if I’m already fast
[1:42:55] zachgamegodx: with damp it’s like 120 k healing in a 2 min game
[1:42:55] asenku11k: i had grilled fish with chorizo and souerkrout
[1:42:57] allstarkeung: @alucen  I don't think it's the game's fault lol
[1:43:08] ramenxo: am i fried in thinking there are some ppl being super sus with precog. like i swear ppl are randomly juking my at 95% on a cast and then they panic and dont know how their cast stopped
[1:43:20] Dokkotter: !wotlk also hello ven
[1:43:24] alucen: @allstarkeung yes its clearly me considering i outheal the ppl i vs
[1:43:38] zachgamegodx: @ramenxo no it’s just really hard to kick ppl with 50% haste
[1:43:41] redsalem: Not all about output
[1:43:42] allstarkeung: out heal just means your team mights are taking more damage
[1:43:43] dudzhi: love the mindset baby
[1:43:46] allstarkeung: output means nothing
[1:43:47] Hobblefoot: LOL Bad take man.
[1:43:48] dudzhi: buss
[1:43:53] kazz_ret: @allstarkeung i dont think u understand how pvp works man
[1:43:59] Hobblefoot: It is something.
[1:44:02] allstarkeung: teammates*
[1:44:07] Nateypww: time to get good
[1:44:12] driftwood_tc: NOTED dont blow load too quickly
[1:44:19] allstarkeung: I don't lol?
[1:44:25] gelatokush: i gave up on being good its too hard MyAvatar
[1:44:26] rissel: maybe thats why im hardstuck 1600 healer
[1:44:27] alucen: I did, i have like 4000 games this season and I keep trying to use my cds in a meaningfull way, like i honestly do whatever I can do do better
[1:44:27] ItsBees: I can do a lot of damage as boomy by dotting pets but that doesn't mean I'm killing stuff LUL
[1:44:35] zerx_gg: time to check overhealing done
[1:44:35] Lazeeqt: whaazz started playing NA, game over now MrDestructoid
[1:44:36] dudzhi: PepoDance PepoDance
[1:44:36] Hobblefoot: I lead in healing all the time but one good cc chain or a kick at the right time and I lose.
[1:44:40] ramenxo: make an alt
[1:44:42] ramenxo: ur mmr is fried
[1:44:43] zachgamegodx: my kick rate this szn is such a joke,
[1:44:43] nikthevoker: mes WA pack BIS
[1:44:44] FreddoB: the game is ass is a feeling I have often but it’s prob me 😅
[1:44:57] addyz0r: dew mvq and jamie games were funny
[1:45:08] addyz0r: seemed like jamie and dew had good synergy
[1:45:09] allstarkeung: post some vods on /r/worldofpvp and get some feedback
[1:45:19] allstarkeung: @alucen
[1:45:26] zachgamegodx: I loved when they beat the move
[1:45:56] alucen: @allstarkeung yea, thats an idea, but rn I just hate the game idk, maybe when my head's clearer
[1:46:03] zachgamegodx: cdew and the eu boys
[1:46:11] zachgamegodx: then main team beat the move
[1:46:17] Atmosh: Whats the song called, I'm fried
[1:46:20] vanlonja: SS feels very class dependent to me right now. At the same rating I am bouncing from 5-1 to 1-5 very regularly.
[1:46:27] addyz0r: move played outlaw dh sham
[1:46:31] storm_chaser_ron: that guild clash event could not have been less serious
[1:46:34] zachgamegodx: I’m a liquid/ echo fan
[1:46:42] zachgamegodx: I like those guys
[1:46:53] CaptnMurphytv: @Atmosh D.A.R.E.
[1:47:08] Koraszdormu: What's good, Ven.  How you doing today brother?
[1:47:08] allstarkeung: How long will it take me to full gear for pvp right now? I'm considering a resub
[1:47:10] addyz0r: I'm liquid but i love them all :D and want them all to have fun
[1:47:14] zachgamegodx: if you had a team id have to not watch
[1:47:19] peeachy8: Morning

[1:48:01] meglo748: game over

[3:04:40] zerx_gg: deep shatter probably
[3:04:44] zachgamegodx: Do u ever press frost bolt in gspike build or nah
[3:04:52] wolfgunxz: Hope they nerf dh soon
[3:05:00] wolfgunxz: Or make some tuning
[3:05:16] VetisBR: can you share that build you are playing for rog/mage 2s pls
[3:05:26] SpeedyMcD: you think they should make evoker a 40yd range spec
[3:05:52] Hobblefoot: I did not realize that at the highest level DH cannot be beat vs certain comps.  That changes my thoughts quite a bit.
[3:06:29] gelatokush: honestly pvp is decent when dh is the best melee
[3:06:43] sistahfistah1: HUHH
[3:06:58] dismantlle: @gelatokush spoken like a true dh main
[3:07:06] gelatokush: i dont main dh
[3:07:14] gelatokush: i play every class
[3:07:17] wolfgunxz: @gelatokush yes then every game dh because everyone can play it
[3:07:27] gelatokush: id rather have dh on top then ret or rogue
[3:07:32] gelatokush: personal pref
[3:07:33] Hobblefoot: @gelatokush I don't mind DH being super strong. But if what I just heard is right, no spec should be literally impossible to beat.  Hard to beat, sure... but impossible to beat.  Maybe my take on this is incomplete.
[3:08:19] wolfgunxz: Blizz has to fix a lot of fix on dh. For example u cant stun dh with blur up from behind
[3:08:26] Hobblefoot: Ven you are a monster in 2s on that mage.
[3:08:55] sistahfistah1: babooshka goes brrr
[3:08:57] VetisBR: can you share that build you are playing for rog/mage 2s pls

[3:09:21] zachgamegodx: omet storm instead of splitting
[3:09:43] realwendell: hey ven do you know if grounding totem works against mass polymorph
[3:09:47] Hobblefoot: @venruki Thanks for giving us this treat. Playing with Whaaz.  I like hearing you two talk about the game. Interesting perspectives and whatnot.
[3:09:50] zerx_gg: what about glacial assault with rogue
[3:10:10] zerx_gg: aw
[3:10:15] Tony1973: Is any tier worth it for frost spec?
[3:10:17] zerx_gg: 6% dam seems nice

[3:13:47] 19derrick97: Hi, i just started playing arcane mage, have you got any tips for off burst damage?
[3:14:34] relapsethegod: bruh
[3:14:35] zerx_gg: xdd
[3:14:41] Goahti: yes ice wall
[3:14:49] addyz0r: that was some rm shit right there KEKW
[3:14:49] zerx_gg: Ven, thoughts on dwarf mage
[3:14:50] StromicusRex: xpp
[3:14:52] ATHLTE: put the moves on em ven
[3:14:53] bokioz: do you feel a bit pressure when playing with the GOAT?
[3:15:07] zerx_gg: xpp
[3:15:44] xvpsp: you look so calm x)
[3:15:44] StromicusRex: funny when people ask that as if ven's not also in that category himself
[3:15:55] trashukkonen: i cant even use the icewall for some reason it doesnt cast it
[3:16:03] bokioz: Its a joke man, relax Stormciousrex
[3:16:03] zerx_gg: wym this dude washed af
[3:16:10] nightmxz: @19derrick97 Get your 4pc ready by consuming a few clearcasting then get 3 procs of missiles -> arcane surge -> touch of the magi -> missile 3x -> PoM blast -> blast -> barrage if they're in execute range
[3:16:20] slickdaddyg69: ven if u nervous just remember u have more glads than whaazz
[3:16:21] Hobblefoot: Did it ever occur to you guys that it is Whaaz that is nervous about playing with VENRUKI .... I mean come on.
[3:16:21] relapsethegod: Bro said Stormcious lol
[3:16:22] bsg_wiz: yo Ven how u doin fam
[3:16:22] StromicusRex: lmao i am relaxed thanks
[3:16:41] zerx_gg: Stormcious goes so much harder than stromicus
[3:16:41] zerx_gg: ngl
[3:16:45] bsg_wiz: u think outlaw/rdruid is the best in the whole game at 2s? why just bc they can be really evasive and stealthy?
[3:16:48] bsg_wiz: while healing i mean
[3:17:06] bsg_wiz: apparently some MW heals break u out of stealth lol i was watchin omni
[3:17:07] cantfindthebox: big dam, does 80k
[3:17:26] StromicusRex: never changing it @zerx_gg
[3:18:18] zerx_gg: i wanna change my name
[3:18:19] Hobblefoot: @bsg_wiz Because they are both very hard to kill, yeah and can take most games to dampening and win the long game very often. Outlaw's spells reset very fast so they are vanishing little tanks.
[3:18:26] slickdaddyg69: ven if u nervous just remember u have more glads than whaazz
[3:18:44] bruce_t_wayne: what does your macro for Counterspell and Ice Nova do?

[3:20:14] frost4mournee: ven give advice pls when me plays solo shuffle I should do more sheep’s or focus at damage?
[3:20:18] j0j0j0j0j0j0: time to nerf ret again?
[3:20:18] pr0x365: Whats going on Ven
[3:20:41] slickdaddyg69: @frost4mournee do more dmg
[3:20:53] bsg_wiz: ret is great IMO
[3:21:05] goatskull123: try to get a sheep in before focusing on dmg
[3:21:06] bsg_wiz: @frost4mournee ur frost?
[3:21:09] peeachy8: ret is amazing in greens I double everyones damage
[3:21:11] rembrandt89: people to fixated on dh atm to a knowledge ret
[3:21:11] frost4mournee: thx a lot
[3:21:29] Kikrino: uuuwuuu Mirror match!
[3:21:31] bsg_wiz: as frost if u focus on damage u will naturally freeze them too
[3:21:34] frost4mournee: @bsg_wiz me frost yep
[3:21:34] bolddywow: reit in 2s suuck
[3:21:39] bsg_wiz: thats the big reason frost is dope pvp IMO
[3:21:43] bsg_wiz: bc u can focus dam
[3:21:45] bsg_wiz: and still do cc
[3:22:00] addyz0r: your new vid title is so topkek
[3:22:02] addyz0r: :D
[3:22:11] bsg_wiz: like frost nova, blink, blizzard is an age old combo that still works both cc and dam
[3:22:24] Nateypww: can you believe they still haven’t fixed the shield bug disappearing when you change talents
[3:24:29] addyz0r: only saw title
[3:25:00] bsg_wiz: I watched ur vid on whats plaguing wow, i forget how new it is exactly. but i agree just dont think most of the complaints are a huge deal...my biggest issue personally is class homogeny for sure

[3:25:59] zerx_gg: @ramenxo
[3:26:03] laggy_cs: its rng
[3:26:08] NJMcChillan: the hotfix was they improved the bad luck protection
[3:26:10] laggy_cs: so some people have it and others dont
[3:26:12] bsg_wiz: the RNG way easier now
[3:26:15] addyz0r: too low drop rate and people cry
[3:26:21] bsg_wiz: they buffed pity basically
[3:26:26] Hobblefoot: @addyz0r Truth Bomb
[3:26:39] Schwenkyytv: i think devs work load are spread to thin with all the different parts of the game
[3:26:45] zerx_gg: Gnomobility has proven  you dont need legendary axe
[3:26:49] explic_cit: „content is dead - reacting to reactions“
[3:27:08] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[3:27:10] bsg_wiz: yeah in gacha games they call that a pity roll when the game says ur luck is so bad and they hand u something out
[3:27:24] uncannysword: let's normalize not saying let's normalize
[3:28:15] bsg_wiz: Nothing to do with balance but i personally feel the Homogeny of the classes makes the game way less fun that it could be
[3:28:24] Yanzoh: Wow i havent heard this song in 20 yrs, such a classic!!!
[3:28:30] bsg_wiz: IMO a warlock shouldnt even have stuns let alone a huge aoe stun

[4:50:30] Setupwizard: @highmoon7 o god
[4:50:32] agren13: the 50sec PI buffing that has a chance to then buff the priest etc, seems like something that can get a bit overcomplicated

[4:54:56] StromicusRex: it comes up a lot because we theoretically could leave the union, but that'd fuck over both the state and the country @nuckD
[4:54:59] lacusdark: why do you think there some serious lack of balance changes from the devs ?
[4:55:05] cxar2202: did u go to fight he russians? @venruki
[4:55:14] plebcake_: has there ever been a WoW tournament outside of America?

[5:43:34] Goahti: Too many people like that guy
[5:43:34] strafekey: the Pala is just the type of player that can never admit he is wrong
[5:43:35] raspador: welcome to solo
[5:43:36] Not_J_o_n: That's crusaders alt
[5:43:38] demondogx7: if he stayed on the dh and u stayed on the druid you would of  won

[5:43:57] 00ZZEE: "Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience."
[5:44:11] reczy__: Like a healer asked me to kite in ruins with no mobility buttons up when he used dome
[5:44:20] reczy__: Flamed me for it
[5:44:24] Badasti: everyone in chat going ham as if theyve never called out a bad play that actually wasnt LUL
[5:44:39] Myth_The_Wolf: Ven, is it worth it to farm lootboxes on healers to send them to alts you wanna play?
[5:44:53] Rnzdawg: queueing solo shuffle as heal all day is not good for one's mental health
[5:44:56] Shysty021: I prefer not to call out bad players, not sure how their day is
[5:45:04] famous1939: @Myth_The_Wolf if you dont mind healing, you do farm boxes quickly and it makes gearing them easier
[5:45:17] 00ZZEE: @Badasti That isn't the issue, the issue is that the person ignores the proof and refuse to admit that he is wrong
[5:45:21] dismantlle: @Badasti And when im proven wrong I get embarrassed and/or apologize, not double down xd
[5:45:34] zachgamegodx: He'
[5:45:37] zachgamegodx: is a b ad person
[5:45:47] famous1939: bad blind that prevented a kill on the druid there if anything

[5:46:01] RedeemedbyJesus: A guy on your friend's list said that?
[5:46:27] CholoBaggins: he yelled at a blizzcon champion and paid commentator for WoW arena competition
[5:46:40] Rnzdawg: was 100% the right play to switch there
[5:46:41] fistweaveurnan: You and mage both swapped together
[5:46:45] famous1939: need the mage blastwave there ftw
[5:46:46] b1det: thats someone that wont improve by acknowledging his mistakes
[5:46:46] austin_545: Ignore= he has no ground to stand on and his ego cant allow him to see reality so he has to run away from the situation.
[5:46:56] PsyqoSupreme: meanwhile shaman never dips below 100%, lol
[5:46:58] WardenDOTA: that's some highly ethical fury war damage
[5:47:05] ferahgok: yea he's just stubborn and doesn't want to look at game from any other perspective than his own. just too stubborn to admit he's wrong all there is to it
[5:47:25] dismantlle: agreed, that combined with telling u did something wrong when they are wrong is most annnoying thing u can do
[5:47:31] foxyllama: well thats because ur wrong ven if u were right he would say ur right
[5:47:36] Rnzdawg: ggs man you played well
[5:47:45] xGriefxGodx: @foxyllama HEY FAXY

[5:48:27] kustumtv: lol thats killaks acting like a baby
[5:48:30] foxyllama: all i see is healer abuse here, imma walk myself out
[5:48:45] VetisBR: put a shirt on bro
[5:48:46] relapsethegod: Well idk I can see his perspective cus I also am never wrong and play percectly every game that's why I'm stuck at 2100
[5:48:56] DrewPBallz18: YO YO

[5:49:03] gdodmebxu: those players never get better
[5:49:10] andelko_: solo shuffle can bring out the worst of ourselves

[5:49:32] DrewPBallz18: I just ran threes with palumor on my rdruid, Why is druid so bad compared to shaman
[5:49:37] wackpoetic: foxyllama is vensuki your dh?
[5:49:41] gdodmebxu: i just think part of improving is recognizing what you can do better
[5:50:21] WardenDOTA: only the miestro can heal palumor
[5:50:39] demondogx7: does anyone have a debuffs profile i can have
[5:50:41] zachgamegodx: @DrewPBallz18 Ven just ran 3's with Whaazz.
[5:50:48] DrewPBallz18: sham has so much more control and i feel like i can keep them topped up and have more stuff for big dam compared to druid
[5:50:53] VetisBR: is ele sham any good?
[5:51:14] raspador: we are not getting any tuning changes wow
[5:51:50] g2ody: @venruki Do you support the idea of bringing back old elite sets and other exclusive transmogs? I think it ruins the whole point of them, but I've seen plenty of folks saying this would help revive PvP.
[5:51:56] demondogx7: can u show ur bigdebuffs settings bro
[5:52:00] likeewlock: maybe on friday but dont think so
[5:52:07] dismantlle: does mr streamer play arcane?

[5:52:48] zachgamegodx: we need to see u play it
[5:52:54] cadillacseville: horrible excuse. it would take 5 minutes to fix half the problems.
[5:53:07] sbrees: I dont think there will be any tuning until S4
[5:53:10] walokki: buff frost mage worst caster atm
[5:53:12] ivakabarona: venruki do you know if shattered destiny build on dh (demon build) is good in 2s
[5:53:13] Bobogotit: how many years until wow dies?
[5:53:31] zachgamegodx: they should increase the sub cost if they're haivng issues maintaining an active staff
[5:53:43] likeewlock: so layoffs effected dev wow team
[5:53:45] Slayer_Eagleone: PepeLaugh

[6:04:43] Vulvayer: altertime need a longer cd or a shorter uptime

[6:51:47] aarongarey1993: Build your own house in the woods 🪵 🙌
[6:51:50] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: date the rate and marry the house
[6:51:50] heymomimonttv: 3 is also astronomically low and an outlier
[6:51:51] Atlas62: What are the worst specs in shuffle right now ven?
[6:52:00] MaximumnNeo: i live in Calgary actually

[6:52:08] Typhoid: permitting is also way too high
[6:52:10] arcane_p: yea it doesn't seem like much when they use low number like 3 and 7 but that is huge over a 30 year span
[6:52:18] BigPatty123: TRUUEEE IT SUCKS HERE I CANT AFFORD A HOUSE FOR 1MIL T-T
[6:52:20] Typhoid: you have variable rate?
[6:52:24] zachgamegodx: would it just not be healthy for you to stream cdew/pika hours? those hours seem giga profitable for streaming due to the ppl coming off work who have big pockets etc
[6:52:27] roberxsillo: wtf in Canada dont ?
[6:52:28] Stickypilloh: the grass isn't greener over here
[6:52:30] MaximumnNeo: when i first bought my  house rates were 2%, that wo uld have been great for 30 years
[6:52:36] arcane_p: yea but the rate can vary mid way through
[6:52:37] DaveTheBrave1: we signed the contract at 3%, now its like 6%, live in sweden
[6:52:42] BetterknownasJohn: locked in for 2.99 atm
[6:52:43] ramenxo: lock in a 30 year interest rates, our kids get shot at in schools. win some lose some.
[6:52:45] thedonmac: thats like the uk
[6:52:46] addyz0r: Thinks that's the same here. 30 year
[6:52:52] Typhoid: do you actually get a deed after your loan is paid?
[6:52:53] Tippolippo: I've had variable rate since day 1 in sweden. sucks I didnt lock it in with this inflation
[6:52:55] Adessius: @BetterknownasJohn same
[6:53:14] roberxsillo: That is so stressful
[6:53:23] BigPatty123: @ramenxo why have kids in this kind of world anyway? weird take
[6:53:29] Kymagez: back to the basement Pog
[6:53:30] Typhoid: I want multifamily complexes to become a thing more like spanish style ranches
[6:53:41] Typhoid: id totally share a large villa with family
[6:54:02] zachgamegodx: your basement was amazing it had flags
[6:54:08] Kymagez: build a tiny home for jackie out back itll be fine
[6:54:13] Kymagez: LUL
[6:54:19] Altimatex: @BigPatty123 thats a real good question

[6:54:36] abolick88: anti canada
[6:54:37] Typhoid: sounds like corporate communism
[6:54:41] Strussedout: i remember that =(
[6:54:42] neoxue: Canada propaganda
[6:54:48] fugginhiding: hong kong time
[6:54:51] Adessius: #freehongkong
[6:54:51] abolick88: ahh
[6:54:53] Kymagez: lol
[6:54:55] abolick88: hong kong time
[6:54:59] ramenxo: prolly during hong kong time tryna pretend like they were ambiguous
[6:54:59] Typhoid: overwatch has every flag ever made
[6:55:03] Typhoid: lol
[6:55:05] Kymagez: but lets .... our staff
[6:55:12] maybethistimepls: what class healer u respect the most? and why is it rsham?
[6:55:18] VetisBR: things are silly. cant have a flag for your country up. calling shit body type 1 and body type 2

[6:55:29] zachgamegodx: I was super surprised to see overwatch has a 3.4 on steam
[6:55:32] Vigi9413: I might have convinced her ven mission success but we gotta wait for payday
[6:55:32] Typhoid: and being able to move it lol
[6:55:35] zachgamegodx: i like  it
[6:55:44] thedonmac: @aarongarey1993 good man
[6:56:08] thevincent1991: does this apply to aus>
[6:56:10] Kymagez: helloe fresh is awesome for the discount
[6:56:11] aarongarey1993: @thedonmac thank you
[6:56:12] Typhoid: hello fresh is lit and its already portioned for cooking
[6:56:14] Kymagez: exactly
[6:56:16] Typhoid: like hardly any prep
[6:56:18] heymomimonttv: @zachgamegodx meh, when you compare overwatch 2 to 1 and all the lackluster changes made, it kinda make sense. overwatch 2 is fine dont get me wrong, but its a big fall from grace compared to 1
[6:56:18] zachgamegodx: it’s convenient saves you lots of time
[6:56:19] Kymagez: can cancel no issue
[6:56:21] abolick88: wtf is hello fresh like frozen dinners or just the food to prepare?
[6:56:27] thevincent1991: dam coz me and mrs wanted to give it ago
[6:56:30] zachgamegodx: a 3.4 tho @heymomimonttv ,???
[6:56:39] addyz0r: I didnt find the danish version that cheap.
[6:56:46] Typhoid: it could sit on your porch for like 6 hours
[6:56:52] Typhoid: its got like huge ice packs
[6:57:11] Kymagez: not everything tbh, they do need eggs etc sometimes
[6:57:33] TheBoysCT: yeah it expects you'll have basics like salt/pepper/oils/butter/etc
[6:57:35] Kymagez: but its def worth for the discount code
[6:57:41] aarongarey1993: Does hello fresh do beans on toast?
[6:57:46] konkrecik_17: s
[6:57:47] maithanet: yea, would definitely be an easy way to learn how to cook
[6:57:48] Typhoid: factor is more single person hello fresh is better for cooking and families
[6:57:52] heymomimonttv: @zachgamegodx yea thats still slightly better than average (3). the hardcore overwatch community has been pretty displeased with 2
[6:57:58] thedonmac: there is cooking and heating things uo though
[6:58:03] Jerbadino: @venruki Yea I've used hello fresh a bit and its pretty great. Definitely gives you a good base of meals to cook
[6:58:07] thedonmac: up*
[6:58:15] arcane_p: I really like them and use them but my American nature forces me to make double orders cause the portions are small
[6:58:17] Typhoid: we save the cards
[6:58:19] Typhoid: at my house
[6:58:26] heymomimonttv: cooking stream would be so fun dude
[6:58:28] Typhoid: and you can use the cards to buy the meals at your grocery after
[6:58:42] Kymagez: ^
[6:58:42] zachgamegodx: @heymomimonttv i think 5v5 is superior
[6:58:45] Fixit_cat: Whats your favorite dish or cuisine to cook?
[6:58:47] Kymagez: the recipies are good
[6:58:49] zachgamegodx: and the most recent update they did is poggas
[6:59:01] Typhoid: there is a bok choy meal thing thats good
[6:59:07] heymomimonttv: @zachgamegodx i def think 5v5 is better as well but my main fps is siege so that makes sense lol
[6:59:18] Fixit_cat: Damn, sounds good
[6:59:19] Kymagez: :O
[6:59:28] Kymagez: that sounds nice
[6:59:31] ATHLTE: yea that sounds hella good
[6:59:37] Kymagez: you got a recipe
[6:59:58] Typhoid: aye someone signed up for hello fresh
[7:00:00] heymomimonttv: @zachgamegodx i was top 10 torbjorn in the world season 1 of overwatch 1, and top 100 soldier76 as well that same season. i don't love overwatch like i used to. again, i dont think its bad but i can see why the hardcore community is upset by it
[7:00:01] Kymagez: mhm
