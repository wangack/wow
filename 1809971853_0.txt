[0:50:54] radi0rat: @sodapoppin I don’t know if you know this but At level 10 as a  Druid you can visit your trainer to start the quest chain for  Bear Form. This is a relatively fast quest and easy series of quests that provide a form that is going to be very useful the entire time you level. It will be your primary form of damage until you unlock  Cat Form at level 20. It will also allow you to play as a tank in dungeons and give you more defense out in the world Vs mobs and enemy players.

[4:16:34] Spyanide: if its uber eats, its an app on an ipad, the restaurant gets supplied with the ipad and app n shit
[4:16:36] Ampitere: driver just delivers it from point a to point b

[7:04:36] killzoz: Chance, as we venture through the vast expanse of World of Warcraft year after year, I'm struck by the realization that our love for this game binds us together in a profound and special way. Our connection runs deeper than mere acquaintanceship, and we don't even need to be friends to recognize our shared passion. It's like we're part of an exclusive club with a deep understanding of the game's intricacies and subtleties (I play rogue lol).. So carry on, good sir. Approve
