[6:17:15] an_chill: CAS makes it look like that's the last time you play CS in your entire life ahaha
[6:17:21] iCodycs2: We need a special word for when you nade the smoke open. I love doing it.

[6:18:43] Maxist07: that song slaps, right?
[6:18:50] RangeRns: this songs so good
[6:18:50] y4mz: farting in the smoke

[6:19:02] RangeRns: i thought u were eepy
[6:19:04] RangeRns: y4mz

[6:19:40] cryptonious: It plays I think right
[6:19:40] Maxist07: top right thing wasnt ur package los its the subtick

[6:20:37] xriffa: @xxxfinny im cracking the smoke yeah thats good callout CRACKING NOW
[6:20:39] Maxist07: i think if it spikes it shows you the interaction with the server, like when you plant but im not 100% sure tho
[6:20:46] Maxist07: just saw a bit from it on twitter

[6:22:05] rezv: cant move it
[6:22:08] rezv: from top right
[6:22:09] Maxist07: i still want left hand back
[6:22:24] rezv: soon ™️ ^
[6:23:31] rezv: idk
[6:23:35] rezv: just coping
[6:23:37] rezv: KEKW
[6:23:42] rezv: hopefully soon though
[6:23:57] rezv: tbf should already be in the game
[6:23:58] Maxist07: i still dont understand why so many people say cs2 is worse than go
[6:24:03] Maxist07: ^
[6:24:06] SeraphLUL: also need bob commands back PepeHands
[6:24:16] rezv: unless
[6:24:41] rezv: they're planning to make left hand visible for all players
[6:24:56] Maxist07: Thats true with the bob commands, weapons kinda feel odd but if you play enough they just hit aswell
[6:25:09] rezv: which is the only reason I think left handed is not in the game already
[6:25:12] Maxist07: it has lot of downs but also ups, like Nading a smoke away etc
[6:25:12] xriffa: cs2 needs patches but people complained when cs go came out aswell
[6:25:13] Maxist07: thats just sick
[6:25:29] rezv: go was worse on release imo
[6:25:36] Maxist07: ^
[6:25:39] Maxist07: Go was shit when it came out
[6:25:42] rezv: fuck people dont even remember flash boost mid in mirage
[6:25:47] rezv: above con
[6:25:55] rezv: and then being able to see people thru walls
[6:25:56] rezv: KEKW
[6:26:04] SeraphLUL: @xriffa go was awful on release but that was over a decade ago and surely they learn from their mistakes Clueless
[6:26:09] Maxist07: im so sure that if they drop a n operation this game will peak again
[6:27:01] SeraphLUL: GAMBA
[6:27:11] xriffa: @SeraphLUL yeah youre right thats obviously a process that leads to full potential... or downhill lets hope/cope its good
[6:27:28] thegtabot: That's a dumb take. CSGO never died at any point. It just went from being bad to good bc of updates with a steady following the whole way through
[6:27:52] thegtabot: Yea everyone stuck on CSS
[6:28:14] disquared: !gamble 444
[6:28:15] StreamElements: disquared lost 444 points in roulette and now has 123582 points! FeelsBadMan
[6:28:23] rezv: i miss the good ol css combat surf days
[6:28:41] thegtabot: CSS is still alive and has a huge following
[6:28:42] rezv: having people rage down mic, cause you're going 10k+ velo and noscoping them PepeLa
[6:29:06] xriffa: my take is when they release new skins along with an update its gonna get better from then on
[6:29:13] thegtabot: I wish they hadn't have gotten rid of CSGO but I do understand the decision
[6:29:24] Maxist07: both donut
[6:29:42] thegtabot: CSGO would have fractured the player base like early CSGO.
[6:30:40] thegtabot: Yea so many braindead children saying CS2 is gone and CS is dead as a franchise. They don't realize how long CS has been a thing
[6:30:47] xriffa: valve devs agreed with this but they said faster release also meant better feedback so less waiting time for a good game
[6:31:57] Maxist07: let them cook
[6:32:28] thegtabot: Or overwatch devs. We need team fortress 3 now to shit on overwatch
[6:32:37] rezv: nah
[6:32:41] rezv: valve never goes to 3
[6:32:51] rezv: so its Team fortress 2.5 next
[6:33:25] iCodycs2: looks good
[6:33:27] PrunJuice: it's silky
[6:33:30] thegtabot: I do think overwatch 2 is a great game hot take.
[6:34:34] thegtabot: I just miss when team fortress 2 was popular it's the only other game similar to overwatch
[6:34:37] rezv: Sounds like H1Z1 devs when corporate higher ups forced them to do combat update or they were gonna get fired (according to the lead dev back then) cause they wanted to bring h1 to ps4 KEKW

[6:39:06] iCodycs2: yeah i put in show fps 0 and it worked the steam fps overlay was 20fps or i would have known
[6:39:14] thegtabot: Holy shit you're insane

[8:49:25] Terrozer: like every 3 days, a boring ass raid only 2 bosses that arnt literal trash packs, shit gear
[8:49:45] Terrozer: if its more of that im gonna lose my mind
[8:50:26] dunark_: classic was never a raiding game. always been wpvp u know
[8:51:07] Soniti: it's funny the effect of taking a tiny amount of fall dmg is so much more dramatic for T than CT
[8:51:17] Soniti: when dinks do like 98 dmg
[8:51:27] Terrozer: nope
[8:51:35] Soniti: er 92? i forget
[8:51:36] Terrozer: not for seasonal servers
[8:51:54] Terrozer: yeah
[8:52:38] Terrozer: lvl horde shit, i just made a second account to boost myself
[8:52:38] Fossabot: mendos in horde cause he could take a horde of guys at once
[8:53:32] Terrozer: i am, i spent all of classic doing the 300+ mob pack pull in mara

[8:54:19] Terrozer: im gonna start with learning rfc when i get to lvl8 i think that will be super ez
[8:54:26] Terrozer: then ill learn wc
[8:54:50] Terrozer: unless i need more gear to make it work or something
[8:55:14] Terrozer: living flame actually has a really good spell coefficient
[8:55:20] Terrozer: so that might matter
[8:56:11] Terrozer: yuuuuuuup
[8:56:16] Terrozer: and sappers
[8:56:22] dunark_: i agree
[8:56:26] dunark_: super sucks your not dwarf
[8:56:30] Terrozer: unless you wanna farm ranks
[8:56:44] Terrozer: then u just camp enemy flight paths or premade wsg
[8:57:21] Terrozer: yeah if i wasnt playing heroic icc i would be so sad in terms of what i get to raid
[8:57:35] Terrozer: im half way thru my smorne on my warr
[8:57:46] Terrozer: getting it late cus im a pooor
[8:58:02] MajorlyFoxed: wait thats what you look like mendo?? i thought you looked like this ---> buh
[8:58:11] Terrozer: i think first 5 bosses is way too easy
[8:58:16] MajorlyFoxed: buh buh buh
[8:58:18] Terrozer: 3rd boss dies in 30sec
[8:58:27] Terrozer: last 2 are okay but nothing hard
[8:58:36] Terrozer: if that was the baseline id be so happy
[8:59:02] Terrozer: yeah
[8:59:13] Terrozer: like the mechanics in all the fights are great
[8:59:21] Terrozer: but the boss dmg and hp are sooooo off
[8:59:33] Terrozer: they are weak and die fast
[8:59:47] Terrozer: EXACTLY
[9:00:25] Terrozer: imo i think that just requires too much work for little old blizzard to afford to a seasonal server, its so stupid.
[9:00:29] Terrozer: but thats just a theory
[9:01:21] Soniti: @Terrozer i agree with your theory and i hate that it's probably like that
[9:01:46] Terrozer: like i think the devs are passionate about it
[9:01:57] Terrozer: but i know how companies work
[9:02:03] Soniti: they are but blizz doesn't wanna dedicate actual effort into new content
[9:02:08] Soniti: so minimal staff on it
[9:02:42] wallhuh: Copege sajj
[9:02:47] Terrozer: they also said they wanna do 40man raiding at 60
[9:02:55] Terrozer: and im not down for that
[9:03:26] Terrozer: i did 40man raiding in classic 4 years ago and thru the entire time, my raid had over 200 members join and leave
[9:03:28] Terrozer: ......NO
[9:03:30] Terrozer: nonononono
[9:03:34] Terrozer: i dont wanna do it again
[9:03:53] Terrozer: its just too many dumb fucks
[9:04:27] Terrozer: yeah if the boys come back alliance will be fine
[9:04:33] Terrozer: if not o7
[9:04:53] Terrozer: i rolled alliance just to play with harry but i took too long
[9:05:06] Soniti: won via timeout but died after
[9:05:08] Terrozer: leveling my horde first and didnt even play with him but once

[9:07:27] Terrozer: or if it is, it has to be fun and the gear has to ALL be good
[9:07:46] Terrozer: KEKW exploring my sanity
[9:07:48] Soniti: sappers were pretty fun during classic world boss 120v120's
[9:08:52] Terrozer: i just cant stand this phase 1 classic style gear that has like half the loot pool is meme trash and the other half is bis

[9:16:08] Terrozer: so knowing i can do that im not worried about any living flame farm
[9:16:10] Soniti: that and the ZFG boost was crazy
