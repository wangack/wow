[0:34:16] Poeter: make everything broken, then nothing will be :)
[0:34:17] Nemenon: I'd much rather they buff the weak than nerf the strong
[0:34:17] shredder1111: dh easier for anyone to pick up
[0:34:20] PastaSeat: I think at everything but the absolute top top tier of ladder 3v3 DHs are oppressive

[0:36:01] shredder1111: the funny thing is they mega buffed holy and its still trash
[0:36:07] Swishinn: the fact that this game is so popular and their communication level is 0 is wild
[0:36:18] Falcanus: they usually get posted around 9pm est, so we got 25 mins until theres no chance
[0:36:19] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:36:34] Swishinn: i play a game that has 3 developers and their communication is 100x better than blizzard
