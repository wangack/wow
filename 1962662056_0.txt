[0:48:32] Xeevo: and what about cleave, cleave is great for tanking
[0:48:33] 5thD5thD: not dumping rage is how you have a heart attack at 40 and died xdd

[2:11:02] wixxastream: @mizkif the amount of threat generated by abilities like "Sunder Armor" can vary depending on various factors, including the character's level, the level of the target, and the character's talents and gear. However, at the base level, the threat generated by a rank 1 Sunder Armor is 260 threat points. rank 5 Sunder Armor generates 520 threat points when used on a target.

[2:26:36] Cadneetwopointoh: @insectito_purpura hit cap reduces chance of enemy dodging you. If you max it the chance goes way down. The cap is 8% or 9%

Mana Management: Vectus can be a mana-intensive fight for the healer due to the damage over time effects and the need to dispel Mutating Injection. Make sure your healer has enough mana potions and mana conservation is a priority.

[4:01:41] wixxastream: @sodapoppin how to kill vectus.  Clear trash mobs carefully before the boss. Manage Vectus's mechanics: Dispel Mutating Injection (disease) carefully. Heal through Corrosive Poison on the tank. Keep Vectus away from corpses to prevent Consume Essence. Spread out the group to manage Mutating Injection. Consider kiting Vectus to prevent corpse consumption. Watch mana management for the healer. Focus DPS during the burn phase. Be prepared with bandages and potions.
