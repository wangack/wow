[8:42:32] iNSANEono: Just cause YOU think I'm a nobody doesn't make me a nobody, I've been in the same guild longer than most people in APES, predating Maitoz even. It's much like a company, just cause colleagues come and goes and you maybe get a new boss, doesn't make it a new company. I didn't join Maitoz guild, maitoz joined our guild and took it over. And cause i wasnt part of his friend group, that made me a nobody for them.
