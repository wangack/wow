[6:31:17] malkath: Divorce by combat, the medieval way of ending a marriage  In medieval Germany, husbands and wives could settle their disputes through marital duels. The man fought with one arm tied behind his back in a hole, while the woman wore weighted clothing and used a sack filled with rocks as her weapon. If they couldn't resolve their differences peacefully, they would engage in the duel. The consequences were severe: the husband would be beheaded if he lost, and the wife would be buried alive.
