Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

[4:48:47] arnoldpalmerlemonade: what he said was kinda confusing
[4:48:47] swittenborn: on a new server, world buffs won't be much of an issue.. i guess other than DMF
[4:48:48] embrs: world buffs is like beating 60 raid content at level 64
[4:48:48] tsuin__: the addon is soooo easy to cheat tho. all the data is client side so you could just validate yourself if you know what you're doing
[4:48:50] Snugglis: @arnoldpalmerlemonade hc server bloodsail bucc on wow classic
[4:48:51] Unra: leveling is best part of any mmo
[4:48:51] Norvelous: should be 5sec warning to get em off, or people might get griefed on some buffs
[4:48:52] KAIJlN: it cant work without tracking of trades, auctions etc
[4:48:56] CueinnNepNep: @Reticent_88 30-40% is still a lot though the only difference i saw was people bringing more hunters which I guess is nice
[4:48:57] UchuKaiVT: leveling does look fun
[4:48:57] ColePowerz: This shit will be dead soon
[4:48:58] MadGhoulishKunt: leveling is the only real content in classic anyway

[6:31:17] malkath: Divorce by combat, the medieval way of ending a marriage  In medieval Germany, husbands and wives could settle their disputes through marital duels. The man fought with one arm tied behind his back in a hole, while the woman wore weighted clothing and used a sack filled with rocks as her weapon. If they couldn't resolve their differences peacefully, they would engage in the duel. The consequences were severe: the husband would be beheaded if he lost, and the wife would be buried alive.
