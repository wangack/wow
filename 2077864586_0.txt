[0:29:26] Icy_Eevee: A+
[0:29:30] elica_rynkath: it's a 100% appropriate reaction to the launch version
[0:29:31] SMilee996: They let the staff go through it
[0:29:32] genesis063: I think it depends on where it airs. Some might get the bit some probably wont.
[0:29:33] Woddell: @Preachlfw It's shit like this that makes it difficult to explain to my in-laws why I enjoy gaming...
[0:29:33] The_Forsaken_Lord: bloody awful

[0:30:47] DeadlyDarro: Not the first time a battle is drawn out in FF, Yiazmat from XII for example
[0:30:48] franzypan: I'm not sure how it would work to try get new players into the world of final fantasy
[0:30:49] krispytuesday: Cindy sold!
[0:30:51] Lctl10: designer dress
[0:30:56] Umseslad: Looking
[0:30:56] viczz88: its an AD for the dress company KEKW
[0:31:00] Woddell: It would get gamers to play. But how many gamers watch Conan?
[0:31:07] revanton93: Frodo and Sam played BG3 too together
[0:31:08] Hekke: yea, devs probably knew its boring, which is why the ring works on it so you can just spam that and skip a tedious fight. (+ the ring has uniques skill animation for the turtle )
[0:31:14] Jauffre_: I would have bought regardless, I don't care about what they think
[0:31:17] Nines713: to be fair its a nice dress YEP
[0:31:21] Streamlabs: Save a life: Learn CPR in 15 minutes - free with British Heart Foundation’s RevivR: http://tinyurl.com/PreachCPR

[0:31:35] trebolf: 100% real and true KEKW
[0:31:36] Wodiin: This will get people to google it to see if it is anything like conan said thus getting people to do secondary looks at the game. This is a win in marketing.
[0:31:39] redroniksre: I love the conan video game segments
[0:31:42] Atticon: the game sold 10 million + too

[0:32:06] Yatak1000: Or you will at least hear about it
[0:32:07] almostalucard: XV was my first FF
[0:32:08] Brandilath: don't need to advertise to the fans
[0:32:09] Elydian: It was watched 10 million times, but that doesn't convert to sales, necessarily.
[0:32:10] alwiro: fantasy fan
[0:32:11] ployboi69: Must consume
[0:32:11] lyra_silvertongue_: i feel like they were going for a "lol look at this nerd game" vibe with the video. like people do with persona games

[0:32:55] xPauL___: its fine to watch on twitch LUL
[0:32:57] Saint_Tweeter: I imagine "normies" would have seen this and gone "this looks stupid" , doens't seem like a good ad to me
[0:33:00] SMilee996: Yeah he did wow review during WOD at the E3
[0:33:07] alwiro: old people
[0:33:07] DMG9: i watch them as youtube clips

[0:33:35] blainyy: @snuffles_80 There was a few "but why" moments during it for me
[0:33:39] BananaBaby29: Watch conan and jordan schlansky its amazing
[0:33:42] Techno_Newt: 3 raiders from Techno_Newt have joined! 
[0:33:43] alwiro: conan the barbarian
[0:33:44] Woddell: @Preachlfw google "conan tbs"
[0:33:57] Umseslad: +3 Raid Pog

[0:34:06] ployboi69: KE
[0:34:08] snuffles_80: Conan and Ferguson was the only one i watched both have stopped doing late shows
[0:34:13] genesis063: the channel is team coco.
[0:34:14] Mordwyl: Surprisingly low
[0:34:14] mimekh: what's he gonna play 13 on? it literally breaks PS3's often enough
[0:34:14] Lctl10: it was at the end
[0:34:15] xzzbx: it's not a cable late night show anymore
[0:34:17] PenguInMug: HUH
[0:34:21] Lctl10: it wasnt at his peak though
[0:34:21] feathyrfall: Conan has always been niche and not a sellout, so.
[0:34:23] Araken1990: didnt late night shows kinda die off?
[0:34:25] AlexSinclair: AlexSinclair subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:34:27] DMGlol: his show was on a different network which kind of screwed him
[0:34:28] Landmine667: He wasnt on cable anymore
[0:34:30] Wodiin: Getting engagement regardless of the viewpoint is the whole point of marketing. If you are interested in it regardless if you are liking it or just googling to see the hate its a massive win for the marketing team.
[0:34:32] aftergl0w: that was after his network screwed him
[0:34:32] mr_geldor: 200k out of 300 million yeah
[0:34:34] SMilee996: @preachlfw the wow one was pretty good
[0:34:35] DMGlol: he was supposed to take over for jay leno
[0:34:46] DMG9: tonight show was before the clip you watched
[0:34:50] Saint_Tweeter: Conan got fucked over by NBC
[0:34:52] Woddell: Wonder how many of them were waiting room tvs where they can't find the remote KEKW
[0:34:57] elica_rynkath: team coco is the youtube channel
[0:35:00] DMG9: conan got fucked over by jay leno
[0:35:01] KaiZen2048: He wasnt on cable, and he refused to do Political Jokes because everyone was doing it
[0:35:19] elcorandy: Conan was always better at stuff he does outside of the main show than the show itself
[0:35:22] truezarosian: what we discussing, chat? :)
[0:35:29] BananaBaby29: Fucked jay leno
[0:35:30] mimekh: conan had to follow a weird leno show at 10pm. i blame him
