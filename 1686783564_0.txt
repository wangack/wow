[1:00:58] Narovoid: It seemed yeah they can’t do anything now. Any nerfs and you just give it to whoever is currently raiding
[1:01:03] flyingmachin3: if they nerf it just feels like they are handing it over if theres nothing else
[1:01:04] Fedratsailor: if they touch it they have to do it with both teams fighting the boss

[1:01:12] Fedratsailor: do it now, they pick the winner
[1:01:12] Uutef: was there any other christmas race
[1:01:20] geokouts: dont nerf! BUFF!
[1:01:21] iccyc0ld: Should of had the raid come out in January
[1:01:25] Aervyper: @Towelliee anything they do is BAD PR
[1:01:27] FergusCreative: Wonder if they can queue a nerf for a certain time on Christmas. So no matter what on Christmas it gets nerfed
[1:01:30] odtee: or they can just make the raid unavailable over the weekend

[1:01:40] xhaven: with Echo at 8% do blizz need to nerf?
[1:01:42] Narovoid: It’s possible that liquid and echo could just agree mutually “let’s not raid on Christmas. We can save the rest for after”
[1:01:44] FergusCreative: I work at an IT company. arybody gone
[1:01:51] Narovoid: But I doubt that will happen

[1:18:39] gelimarr: AYO NEW MIC
[1:18:46] nedzalife: that microphone definitely has a lot more natural tones to it versus the Barry White effect of the SM 7B
[1:18:56] Balistika89: What Add-on shows the item level beside the item in your character screen @towelliee?

[1:28:59] TheOldSchoolRyan: Hows next week looking?
[1:29:01] Krait06: what's making them harder this time around? just the affixes?
[1:29:03] TollBoothVideos: I hopped into a 12 and did 10k dps more than all the other dps and we couldn't get passed the first boss ><
[1:29:03] SilkeySmooth: isnt a m+11 like a m+14 with the scaling?
[1:29:13] Scarhearth: I had a group i was pulling 40-50k overall dps and still wasnt timing because of dps dying to everything touching them
[1:29:21] infektyd: next week is sanguine and volcanic fortitude
[1:29:44] gelimarr: I'll stick to max +8

[1:36:50] gelimarr: who even plays female tauren lol
[1:36:59] infektyd: grevious isnt that crazy cause youre not the healer haha, but it is dependent on the dps helping the healer out
[1:37:31] trexbitesize: This boss is usually okay as long as the dps dodge the boulders. I find the last is always a bitch though.
[1:37:37] lithium364: this should have been obvious, when people in beta refused to play with more then 1 affix above an certain key level
[1:37:39] DisparagingTurtle: The higher keys I notice i spend more holy power off healing , rather than using SotR or WoG on myself

[1:39:46] WaverlyP15: Thats how i run it on my tank, why not use the room you have?
[1:39:50] ty_ston96: you gotta bait the boulder to the sides and have the healer sand where you going to be
[1:39:50] PvtHudson093: A DPS might only have 2 defensives @LSBreed
[1:39:54] Mbakley78: like every class has a self heal and def to keep themselfs alive
[1:40:03] ty_ston96: stand*
[1:40:10] trexbitesize: I didn't move for like +8's but then i moved and life became so much easier

[1:47:51] WaverlyP15: @trexbitesize thats wild, not saying its impossible but resto druid has always out healed me through the entire dungeon. individual encounters i usually out heal.
[1:47:56] trexbitesize: I ain't doing 15's man
[1:47:56] Aervyper: we're gonna fight over a 10. I'd be crying in a 2 and Blizzard wants everyone to be doing 20's
[1:48:01] trexbitesize: i wouldn't know

[1:51:21] WaverlyP15: @trexbitesize Same, but I usually have to Pug healers because don't have on in my core group.  Im a little more reserved with impending victory, just because not everyone knows mechanics and i like to have it for when someone dies or if the healer isnt great just to make sure i dont die. its not that long of a cd and then spread out CD's depending on how its going

[2:06:14] all_the_tanks: I like how all the “nerf x class” takes are based on seeing people who are really good at the class. I’ve seen plenty of DHs barely pull 20k. The problem is when the casuals can pull 100k.

[2:31:34] rosina_scarlett: I can see Blizzard waiting for Liquid to start raiding before they do any hotfixes
[2:31:46] instant_savage: lackluster
[2:31:50] rosina_scarlett: @Holysal yeah but not until Liquid starts raiding
[2:31:53] kashmara: jesus the platform at the end is like barely big enough for 5 players let alone 20
[2:32:10] mavericks312: @rosina_scarlett how do you hotfix it without killing the boss fight completly
[2:32:29] pectol19: what server was that warrior from?
[2:32:41] rosina_scarlett: @mavericks312 what Towelliee said.  make it so the circle closes in slower on last phase
[2:32:54] Holysal: @Holysal yeah
[2:33:15] daGawdT: if i get a BiS in a say at +2, do i upgrade with valor or should i run higher keys still. Key thing is item is BiS

[2:33:36] Alienfromger: without kill dont think they will kill it
[2:33:37] mavericks312: it also depends when that hotfix comes in, do they do it later in the day which favors liquid or early when both teams are still on

[2:41:02] mavericks312: if they touch raz after 4pm today thats an unfair advantage to liquid
[2:41:03] ItsGigg: I think previous chatter got it right. Just buff the boss to make it unkillable until after christmas LUL
[2:41:08] Affiiance: Oh but they can
[2:41:17] Shrenko: they cant reduce her health because it would fuck up overlaps

[2:41:25] Sheckly84: Blizz really screwed the pooch here.

[2:42:01] layali1698: What are we doing at Jade temple? 😳
[2:42:22] Raafuh: I’m a little confused is the Race both NA and EU or did the NA race already happened and we’re watching EU

[2:43:55] Gozzy: last phase has tough rng on who gets the big root ring
[2:44:08] rosina_scarlett: he said bc it's christmas and liquid doesn't want the staff work on it
[2:44:20] Shrenko: alot of Echos roster is celebrating christmas tomorrow @Towelliee most of EU / Nordic countries do
[2:44:27] Brodih_: its also easier to travel quickly in EU with trains and such
[2:44:38] mavericks312: could you imagine bdgg wins world first due to ppl having xmas lol
[2:45:00] Aidler: Liquid could stay where they are. can’t go anywhere because of the storm anyway
[2:45:09] manmower: well-tuned final boss
[2:45:10] Slitze: that's because santa claus doesn't go to europe

[2:46:08] mavericks312: yea thats the difference between echo and liquid, echo doesnt have a company to say when and when not ppl can work

[3:03:27] Holysal: @RavenRadioChaos its a 16 key so its not easy
[3:03:34] UncleBliz: Priests cannot deal with bleeds
[3:03:44] TheRavenGrave: ah
[3:03:47] Nokterian: this week me as a healer i'm taking a week off LUL
[3:03:49] ItsGigg: Basically its gotta stay on top of grevious or it will just become unhealable. With this level key I assume the grevious damage is huge. Its easier on healer with classes that passively heal themselves like blood dk
[3:04:08] Shrenko: pretty weird to think about that a PRIEST cant deal with BLEEDS
[3:04:15] Holysal: @Nokterian at least get one for the vault
[3:05:02] Nokterian: Nah i dont do it not wanna burn myself out because of these terrible affixes week
[3:05:19] ItsGigg: @Shrenko But he's shadow what he gonna do for the other people's bleed lol
[3:05:35] Gozzy: the funny part about the nerfs to this dungeon, is that the last boss is easier than it was last week

[3:25:58] Thoreya: makes sense
[3:25:59] manmower: big advantage for Echo if it comes through at 9am because they're warmed up
[3:26:06] Thoreya: liquid gotta wake up lol
[3:26:07] pereadin: @Shrenko Your vault has a chance to have it in it

[3:32:55] Davedaman26: then why couldn't blizzard have the RWF till after the holidays and not have to worry about all the issues they are having.
[3:32:59] mavericks312: activision wanted that last xpac money
[3:33:09] SilkeySmooth: i needed this expansion to come out in nov..lol

[3:35:11] Keyastaron_: 8????
[3:35:16] manmower: they should just stop the race and have it come down to penalty kicks
[3:35:34] SilkeySmooth: blizzard doesnt handle any wfr well
[3:35:37] Klako1: this race has been boring
[3:35:45] theDirtyon3: What would penalty kicks in WoW look like?
[3:35:47] Leo7V: i think theres less people actually working than we think
[3:35:48] mavericks312: @manmower and have messi doing the penalty kicks
[3:36:00] Davedaman26: hit the nail right on the head they could of waited when releasing the raid

[4:10:25] Nehcrom: They didn't want to work over the holidays.
[4:10:26] TialePetit: @Nerendis They live nerfed the last boss while Echo was doing pulls on it, and Liquid hasn't started their day yet.  Couldnt have been handed it any easier
[4:10:27] Endin: takes away from the spirit of competition
[4:10:28] TheCakeBadger: Liquid knew nerfs would come and should be ready. Still shitty I agree though. If you can predict it @towelliee , they could
[4:10:31] balancedlight: so they nerfed the final phase?

[4:10:50] manmower: if they didn't nerf i think liquid could have killed it today
[4:10:52] im_capy: would feel worse if liquid ended up winning with a nerf given echo got to 8%
[4:11:01] Nehcrom: Hopefully next tier they will be better prepared.

[4:11:17] Nerendis: Wouldn't someone always get screwed though? No matter when they hotfix
[4:11:17] mavericks312: @turbodai because EU bitched when nerfs got put out at 5pm before when echo was sleeping
[4:11:18] Eviltuna13: Damn you Blizz all my AH money is gone sacNOPERS
[4:11:21] winraider: Yes it endet today...any thoughts?

[4:12:01] ClassicMalcontent: "Go to an event center for the RWF" LUL worked well. Oh wait.
[4:12:06] Reckless_Monk: If both teams are up progressing.. then Blizz favors no one
[4:12:06] Lulaboo: It cant feel good for Liquid to wake up to an Echo kill AGAIN
[4:12:10] TheCakeBadger: @sollice cannot please everyone. Especially the wow crowd innit LUL

[4:12:19] recohhhh: Honestly liquid and echo is by fart the best guilds in the game but in my opinion echo is still like 15% or 20% better than liquid still
[4:12:20] mavericks312: the astros 17' world series is more legit then this RWF win
[4:12:20] CriticalPhil: i wouldnt say it was easy sturmax
[4:12:23] Kleva1: @Sollice How would it favor NA when both guilds would do raiding it at the same time?
[4:12:25] Alsparq: link to the nerf
[4:12:26] rosina_scarlett: what nerf happened?
[4:12:26] Rudric_Ice: EZ ECHO the Real WF Guild

[4:12:33] Chronine: actually fucked with that nerf
[4:12:34] Thoreya: i mean not for nothing liquid streaming at 11am pacific every day was not the move
[4:12:38] xhaven: All said though it was a great race, now give us another raid launch in a couple quick months plz blizz!
[4:12:38] Thoreya: where echo woke up early every mornnig
[4:12:52] SilkeySmooth: it shouldnt be world first due to different time zones it should be america first or eu first
[4:12:53] Aurnilon: Wait did they nerf it after liquid went to sleep?
[4:12:56] Sollice: @Sollice It wouldn't Im saying thats what people would have said

[4:13:16] dreamwalker213: @aurnilon they nerfed it like 10-15 mins ago
[4:13:23] Holysal: @Aurnilon no just before that last attempt
[4:13:23] WainDOC: i guess they didnt put as much work as echo did
[4:13:24] mavericks312: @Aurnilon literally 15 minutes agao when no other guild is on
[4:13:30] Davedaman26: Does Max even raid? I see his stream and from the camera looks like he isn't raiding
[4:13:31] Thoreya: maybe liquid shouldnt wait till 11am pacific to start
[4:13:34] Thoreya: imo
[4:13:41] cowthulhu1: I like the race Bette when it wasn’t streamed
[4:13:44] Madnezz123: echo's pull was clean as fuck
[4:13:45] mavericks312: they only played better on the last boss
[4:13:46] Niksen_99: Echo would have won anyway comon guys dont be sore losers
[4:13:47] Djfarmville: @SilkeySmooth BabyRage
[4:13:48] N3llee: Hate that for Liquid but happy those guys can go home and be with their families.
[4:13:50] mmo_kenna_: Lets fucking gooooo ECHO

[4:13:55] lovemymage: more consistent
[4:13:55] DeanoTV: Echo well deserved Clap

[4:14:15] eyemyor: Echo's healing team is the hero
[4:14:16] arturiuss44: roger's looks like penn state logo
[4:14:16] CriticalPhil: lol i tettles etc.. are already packing
[4:14:18] newprophet: Liquid and max are too focused on the content creation rather than winning
[4:14:25] SamuraiWillZ916: trying to put some AI pics i made of you in your discord but i cant add them
[4:14:25] lordofpizza666: ThunderCats hooo
[4:14:26] Chi_Tsumi: homeboy still playin
[4:14:30] witheredtim: Wow Echo is def the goat team! I thought they got lucky in SL, but they actually blow NA out of the park
[4:14:32] repnol_: @Towelliee do you think a worldwide global release for the raid could be a good thing ?
[4:14:32] Ravenward: Go Thundercats HYPERS
[4:14:32] Chi_Tsumi: everyone else celebrating LUL
[4:14:34] EvenstarTV: You think when you NA and EU going for WF with the time difference will be fair when a hotfix occurs?
[4:14:36] N3llee: Echo's viewer numbers are just insane this RWF
[4:14:37] GonePostal101: Echo saved Xmas
[4:14:45] recohhhh: I dont know man, I have no idea what Liquid can do to beat Echo. Echo just seem unbeatable
[4:14:48] Alsparq: what was the nerf to the storm???

[4:15:08] rosina_scarlett: What was the nerf?
[4:15:09] eyemyor: There is no way to make things completely fair.  It just isnt possible.
[4:15:10] iiTornTunaii: Why did liquid not wake up early knowing the kill was soon?  I feel like Echo always wants it more and that’s why they win
[4:15:12] manmower: was their guild lead upset because he realized they were getting free win?
[4:15:13] deadxarrival: they should have kicked them all from raid and nurfed it and then said ok whoever gets it done first wins
[4:15:18] mo_dilly84: Even though method and  and BDGG weren’t far behind without Echo’s and liquids resources would they have been that close.
[4:15:19] trevt6: would liquid have got it last night with thaty nerf or no?
[4:15:21] stixxy23: WHY????
[4:15:22] danimoto10: oh they made a nerf this morning?

[4:15:28] danimoto10: when was the nerf?
[4:15:29] hangloosebro: Wonder what it smells like in there towOof
[4:15:29] lordofpizza666: blizzard do Eco fan boy for sure confirmed
[4:15:32] homegift: Im sure lot of zoom meetings :D
[4:15:33] J53LG: Watch them say it shouldn't count because they slowed the storm too much
[4:15:34] ClassicMalcontent: "Nerf it harder for me Daddy Blizz" LUL Kappa
[4:15:35] dreamwalker213: They nerf was just WAY too much imo. It was soooo slow
[4:15:36] jaalexba: It was the grinch
[4:15:38] Niksen_99: Liquid could literally just set an alarm and pull the boss. Echo clear winner
[4:15:39] Athaeln: Well Echo also had a perfect pull I think , everyone alive with all brs
[4:15:42] SinanUnver: what nerf  ?
[4:15:42] Archiee: that ring was sooooo sloooooow

[4:15:52] Yogibearboog: @lordofpizza666 LUL
[4:15:56] danimoto10: what was the nerf and when guys?
[4:15:59] AvrithSATX: Has anyone from Blizz actually confirmed the nerf and when it went in? I don't see a Blue post about it anywhere.
[4:16:03] rosina_scarlett: @Niksen_99 liquid didn't know w/e nerf would come
[4:16:03] Demvacco: did liquid dirty
[4:16:03] Ravenward: Christmas came early for Echo RainbowPls
[4:16:06] eyemyor: They didnt sac though.  Those guys got back in.
[4:16:09] Reckless_Monk: If the ring was normal.. that third ring always becomes deadly
[4:16:09] rosina_scarlett: @danimoto10 I'm wondering that
[4:16:09] J53LG: @Towelliee and they had 3 brez going into that final 10%
[4:16:13] mavericks312: blizz maybe hated more then the astros right now
[4:16:14] Shrenko: what happend?
[4:16:14] im_capy: wonder if liquid will just call it early without finishing now
[4:16:16] deggon777: scripe on the phone thanking the dev for the nerf
[4:16:17] Niksen_99: 16 hour headstart. leave it at that @rosina_scarlett
[4:16:22] rosina_scarlett: oh hes 100% mad
[4:16:23] Thoreya: max already said it in his chat "nice early nerf"
[4:16:23] GIJosh86: do you think Liquid kills it today too?
[4:16:25] KoalaTeaTime: what nerf?
[4:16:28] nightbringer000: Barry Bonds Asterisk WOrld First Mode....?????
[4:16:29] mavericks312: id be like take your race and fuck off
[4:16:36] Malnar1123: Max is gonna be almost as mad as he was at Asmon last week Kappa
[4:16:37] rosina_scarlett: @Niksen_99 16 hours of liquid having to deal with over tuned bosses :)
[4:16:40] Reckless_Monk: Next few pulls Liquid kills
[4:16:40] GonePostal101: Sign at Blizzard says see you next year
[4:16:42] Shrenko: wait they won??
[4:16:45] LoseAlotLuke: "your cheque will be in the mail"
[4:16:46] eyemyor: Echo played out of their mind.
[4:16:47] Boioioioing: Liquid kills it in one attempt
[4:16:48] xhale2nhale: watch them one shot it
[4:16:50] danimoto10: what was the nerf and when guys?
[4:16:51] Aurnilon: Liquid kills it in first 3 pulls today
[4:16:53] ClassicMalcontent: "RWF" now with conveniently timed nerfs. Kappa
[4:16:54] anord999: Happy for Echo but wanted Liquid to win.  Was there a nerf?
[4:16:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Liquid should finish it
[4:16:58] darkrowse21: #Grinched #raidjustice
[4:16:59] layali1698: He’s chilling on the “RWF starting soon” screen 😬😬😬
[4:16:59] mavericks312: barry bonds career is more legit then that win lmao
[4:17:03] smashwow: Liquid can’t do the toddler walk out again
[4:17:03] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:17:03] Gozzy: blizz can't win. either they nerf it when echo are raiding or when liquid are raiding.
[4:17:06] gritbarontv: but is there evidence that a nerf was done. Do we have the code to verify that.
[4:17:10] Holysal: @Shrenko yeah blizzard hotfixed and the next pull they killed it
[4:17:10] Demvacco: they will get it today
[4:17:15] dreamwalker213: @mavericks312 KEKW
[4:17:19] Alsparq: Liquid haws been in the last phase consistently
[4:17:22] rosina_scarlett: idk what the nerf was
[4:17:23] eyemyor: Its going to require perfect execution to get to the point of where that storm matters
[4:17:24] Reckless_Monk: "Closing the facility guys.. " while one of the Owners is there..
[4:17:25] xhale2nhale: tbh I wanted someone else to win, i'm kinda tired of the same team
[4:17:26] Archiee: sleeping in doesn't pay off in RWF
[4:17:29] 0doz: what can be the difference between Liquid and Echo? .. performance?  statistics ?
[4:17:30] Hyelander_: Echo should kill it again now so they get the World 2nd as well
[4:17:32] rosina_scarlett: @Gozzy you nerf it when both of them are raiding
[4:17:33] Ryvden: @anord999 blizzard nerffed it before last pull
[4:17:34] nightbringer000: @mavericks312 Haha Facts but not by much HAHAHA
[4:17:36] mavericks312: @Gozzy they could have nerfed it at 2pm and it would have been fair
[4:17:39] Kleva1: Really make it controversial if liquid kills it first pull
[4:17:42] Aidler: watch Method now after the nerve finish it second Kappa
[4:17:43] emznev: EU on top once again but I'm sure liquid will come back even stronger next time ggs all arouns
[4:17:44] RENDH: I think its very easy. Just set a time of the day to put in nerfs. That way all teams can play around it.
[4:17:47] nouwandhi: Nice wake up ahaha
[4:17:48] emznev: around*
[4:17:51] Gozzy: you say that, but then liquid get a full day of nerfed prog. and echo wouldn't
[4:17:57] Hexxdecc: Blizz anti NA
[4:18:01] LangleyTN: knowing the race was this close, was it wise for Liquid to be in bed for as long as they were? What time is it now?
[4:18:03] Eviltuna13: Watch Liquid 1 shot in now
[4:18:03] dreamwalker213: 100% way too slow
[4:18:04] im_capy: I blame OTK and starforge sponsorship, they cursed liquid LUL
[4:18:04] TheVanquished_: TheVanquished_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months! 
[4:18:05] ClassicMalcontent: Lesson: Stay home. Don't waste time going to a facility for the event. Blizzard will EF it up for you if you bother to come to the West Coast.
[4:18:07] madbombz_fth: @Towelliee what nerf are you talking about did i miss something?
[4:18:08] Grunton: they just wanted to go on holidays
[4:18:08] Raafuh: It looks like they were close to wiping to be fair?
[4:18:08] lordofpizza666: untested
[4:18:11] CriticalPhil: tbh @Towelliee i dont think it was one person to decide the nerf
[4:18:12] Kleva1: Really make it controversial if liquid kills it first pull!
[4:18:14] Madnezz123: watch them buff it again for Liquid LUL
[4:18:15] infektyd: i hope liquid comes back stronger, doesnt dishearten them too much
[4:18:17] Davedaman26: What if BDGG gets the kill before Liquid.
[4:18:17] eaglerydr: Did the same dimbass mistake with Anduin
[4:18:21] mavericks312: @Gozzy 2 is only 8pm echo time
[4:18:21] Maydie6066: insider corruption towards echo!!! confirmed
[4:18:26] Niksen_99: Comon guys Liquid knew when they went to bed there is a huge chance of losing the race nerfs or not.
[4:18:32] anord999: really?
[4:18:33] anord999: wow
[4:18:35] Keyastaron_: you mean during the appempt Kappa
[4:18:35] LoseAlotLuke: max is live @Towelliee
[4:18:38] Fedratsailor: blizz done them dirty
[4:18:39] LoremasterMarthan: Refs were paid off! Kappa
[4:18:39] Alsparq: @Towelliee Echo played better but liquid had definitely put the time in
[4:18:40] g0n_z3n: so much salt in here LEL
[4:18:40] Keyastaron_: if was nerfed
[4:18:41] MeisterPetze: not crazy, stupid
[4:18:41] KoalaTeaTime: yeah kinda bs
[4:18:44] Gozzy: right @mavericks312 but they've also been up for 12hrs
[4:18:45] WainDOC: it needed nerf anyways
[4:18:45] Raafuh: 5% left and if they missed any cooldowns you don’t think they would’ve wiped?
[4:18:45] rockiller1: that's so unfair
[4:18:45] mavericks312: astro fans im sorry this is the biggest steal i seen
[4:18:46] Thoreya: just my personal opnion but i think lightee is gonna leave liquid
[4:18:47] ryte1676: Liquid could have been raiding for the last 4-5 hours...
[4:18:48] Shrenko: what nerf?
[4:18:49] danimoto10: lol
[4:18:49] 5rooms: is the nerf confirmed or just speculation?
[4:18:50] Hexxdecc: at least they will be going home for christmas

[4:18:53] e1genvect0r: Kinda cringe ngl
[4:18:53] Alienfromger: blizzards tuning towCringe
[4:18:56] manmower: nobody is gonna respect the event anymore, Raszageth deflategate
[4:18:57] eyemyor: Why do people make so many excuses, I dont get it
[4:18:58] sirnewnose: wait did raz fall?
[4:19:00] DevilSpire: @towelliee do you think this mythic raid was to easy?
[4:19:02] Leemann9: that kill was great.
[4:19:04] srze94: Liquid said they were going home after today no matter what, so who cares about them anyways
[4:19:11] Thoreya: i mean they coulda been big boys and woke up earlier, like echo did
[4:19:16] dwolters_the_zombieman: i unfollowed them because a tainted win isn't a real win
[4:19:17] tocu: @Towelliee I think the nerf was always planned to make sure the devs got the best chance to enjoy christmas and didnt at what I assume they considered the point of no return for not doing a nerf
[4:19:17] Noshpan: Could call it hte Blizzard Screwjob. But grats to Echo for the win
[4:19:18] LangleyTN: I think Liquid made a mistake by being in bed, lol
[4:19:18] balancedlight: obvious blizzard is full of echo fans :)
[4:19:18] Dark_Kornax: Liquid sucks mud again.
[4:19:19] Leemann9: ECHO was ahead before the Nerf
[4:19:21] PigPenLen: Bliz is in the same time zone as Liquid though
[4:19:22] Naywils: Liquid should have been online way earlier though sadly
[4:19:23] Dark_Kornax: i don't get it
[4:19:27] Madnezz123: wfr is not an official event. Blizz doesnt care
[4:19:28] Aidler: a lot of people are mad now…. sadge
[4:19:30] sdpercussion: @Thoreya ya its 10am in LA man wtf
[4:19:30] Lostdogal: what nerf? Were are people seeing the hotfix?
[4:19:33] Shrenko: where is the nerf ??
[4:19:33] xmedpakx: i imagine Echo would have won it too bad to they nerfed it at all
[4:19:36] tiyanigean: question: is the nerf written down somewhere or was it shadownerfed?
[4:19:37] xgoldpt: no global release and now its the nerf lol
[4:19:37] sdpercussion: they shoulda been in the raid by 7am
[4:19:45] LeXieSterling: There is always next time.
[4:19:45] honeybadger1113: idk if yall are blind in chat or what but there was a clear fricken nerf we all saw so i dont understand yall lol the ring was slower on final faze ppl
[4:19:46] Thoreya: @sdpercussion while echo is up like 8am everyday
[4:19:54] Thoreya: big difference
[4:19:55] MaRiNexICEx: lol
[4:19:55] manmower: remember, Blizzard said they aren't gonna cater to the 1% anymore, they stuck to their word
[4:19:57] LoremasterMarthan: The nerfs were done to meet a schedule, not to make it "doable"
[4:19:58] Scarhearth: No one is gonna respect the race to world first at this point now because of blizzard
[4:19:58] gritbarontv: they don't work for the guilds, lol
[4:20:00] bazziiiTV: guys .. they played almost perfectly. they went into last phase with everyone up and 3 brez up with the 4th coming up. it was not only the nerf that got them the win
[4:20:03] TheGiant99: the way this ended just makes this a even more who cares event then it already was
[4:20:05] genjosanso: BROOO YOUR TWEET IS CAUSING HATE OR FRICTION
[4:20:05] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:20:10] anord999: such a good race to end like this
[4:20:14] dreamwalker213: @ryte1676 so your solution is start raiding at 5 am or lose?
[4:20:18] sdpercussion: its not a good look to be in bed still at 10am when your competition is doing sub 10% pulls @Towelliee
[4:20:23] N3llee: agree 100% shame on bilzz for deciding this fight.
[4:20:24] xgoldpt: ECHO was simply better
[4:20:40] manmower: i think these guilds could have found a way to beat this pre-nerf
[4:20:40] Niksen_99: You all make the nerf sound like Liquid is going to kill the boss on the first attempt. Echo played perfectly and won
[4:20:41] eyemyor: It's a good raid, and both guilds are playing great.  No shame in 2nd.
[4:20:43] Dyasis: @Towelliee the boss shouldn't have been that overtuned to begin with
[4:20:46] MiddlePhaze: where are the nerf notes?
[4:20:46] Nerendis: But they said they didn't want to do 2 resets before launch
[4:20:46] cowthulhu1: Now they need to buff the storm. It’s to weak.
[4:20:46] Alsparq: @Towelliee I was LOVING this race and this sort of killed it
[4:20:47] winchez_: all i can think is HahaShrugLeft HahaThisisfine HahaShrugRight  is whats going through the devs mind
[4:20:47] Malnar1123: Yeah my wall calendar won the RTWF
[4:20:49] im_capy: Echo was at 8%, what was liquids best pull? with how many more pulls?
[4:20:51] LangleyTN: this is not a good time to have a world first, IMO
[4:20:53] LearnedSomething: merry xmas T
[4:20:54] Zarbos: Echo was so much better ye + 1 day behind gg
[4:20:56] SpookyRootz: lol salty
[4:20:58] tocu: i dont think taking care of your employees when you have been in a situation of treating them  like garbage is a bad choice
[4:20:58] UltraKSlaya: what nerf did they do?
[4:20:59] Lostdogal: I cant see any news on hotfixes, what nerf is it?
[4:21:01] smashwow: Even after Ion saying 10 days is our target
[4:21:03] Archiee: They just spend too much time being unfocused and dicking around
[4:21:07] royhandlesit: I mean, the second team to the boss gets to learn from the first.
[4:21:07] cabalish: we all saw it comming that it would be bad to release a raid near xmas
[4:21:10] PvtHudson093: Then Raids shouldnt be released near  christmas
[4:21:10] ryte1676: @dreamwalker213  work ethic creates opportunity
[4:21:12] WQKPtheDON: if i'm liquid, i can't control blizzard. i'd be mad at myself for not getting up earlier on the last day
[4:21:12] stratiss: there's a pretty distinct difference in player and leadership quality
[4:21:14] SpookyRootz: i love your hat!
[4:21:24] ClassicMalcontent: They always do this. Not the timing. But they overtune on purpose. It's the new way. Overtune then nerf. Which then makes this kind of nonsense.
[4:21:27] Nokterian: True
[4:21:29] xandoxx: Scripe tactics just too good
[4:21:30] deadxarrival: i mean should race to world first go to the team that kills it in the least amount of pulls anyways
[4:21:31] Thoreya: man idk where liquid goes from here
[4:21:31] eyemyor: Echo's leadership and their preparation, 2nd to none.
[4:21:33] Skyiland: if liquid kills it first try now then they can recriminate.
[4:21:40] madbombz_fth: #pizzabuff
[4:21:40] GIJosh86: how late did Liquid go last night?
[4:21:41] Reckless_Monk: yet still bowed out when Paragon was around
[4:21:42] Rudric_Ice: echo is just better
[4:21:43] eaglerydr: When you watch someone else and adjust your strategy that is how they do less pulls
[4:21:46] Coloredtoad: Blizz needs to invite the top guilds to Cali for a couple weeks and normalize the gear and this crap won't happen!
[4:21:46] MOLAR305: Echo played better, but Blizz fucked up with the timing of that nerf
[4:21:46] LearnedSomething: pizza buff
[4:21:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lining up their cooldowns at the right time helped them
[4:21:49] emznev: echo are a just to good
[4:21:50] im_capy: and like you were saying, Trill was dying alot and he is seen as a pumper
[4:21:51] Aidler: pizza being handed out
[4:21:56] xhale2nhale: at some point it just gets boring, I honestly just came to see the last boss
[4:22:03] Gozzy: @Dyasis average ilvl is only 409 for both guilds. its a huge gear gap to full mythic
[4:22:04] Leo7V: i think if they kill in like 3 pulls its a tie
[4:22:08] MourvinMad: Did blizz notify everyone on the nerf i dont see the blue post?  I feel like they could plan the nerf to allow teams to rearrange their schedules
[4:22:09] Syllvn: @Coloredtoad nobody wants to watch that
[4:22:09] Vivelli: @Skyiland huh? the race is over echo won, no take backsies
[4:22:10] Daismoon: Recrimination?
[4:22:11] dreamwalker213: @ryte1676 and 4 hours of sleep created lack of production
[4:22:12] bdobbi: Echo always pushes thru where liquid over thinks everything
[4:22:13] WeaponII: damn... 2 in a row for Echo
[4:22:20] darkrowse21: did you think they will ever not schedule  rwf  around hoildays
[4:22:25] Reckless_Monk: 100%
[4:22:26] Thoreya: 3
[4:22:27] xhale2nhale: yea they played very good but that nerf should've waited
[4:22:29] Nerendis: I'd be pretty damn surprised to see TL just come in and blast
[4:22:29] Drogdorf: 3
[4:22:30] Maydie6066: Echo might have played better, but this RWF will now always be tainted with this nerf
[4:22:30] WeaponII: Oh yes 3
[4:22:30] Thoreya: sod jailor and gthis
[4:22:30] emznev: 3
[4:22:31] MaRiNexICEx: yeah 3
[4:22:31] PvtHudson093: Raids shouldnt be released near christmas
[4:22:31] CarrKinn: so they nerfed and they killed it right after, right?
[4:22:33] Plague_GG: Yea
[4:22:33] LunarVaporz: Its 3
[4:22:34] Zarbos: 3
[4:22:35] eyemyor: Been a LONG time since a guild has had 3 in a row
[4:22:36] ZeusDNA: Yeah 3rd in a row
[4:22:37] GIJosh86: @MourvinMad I think Max and Scripe have a contact that gives them the heads up
[4:22:37] royhandlesit: three timer
[4:22:39] Daismoon: Blizzard does not care who wins
[4:22:41] darthvapor420: shame the liquid boys played their asses off till last boss
[4:22:43] Purgatan: I was pulling for Liquid cause NA, but enjoyed Method's stream more.
[4:22:43] Metket: no more race sadly so much diffo
[4:22:45] Niksen_99: Dont forget Echo had 100 less pulls than Liquid
[4:22:45] darthvapor420: tale as old as time
[4:22:51] CharpieX: echo did really well, and they deserved it. but i think liquid did make improvements this tier compared to the last with discipline and all that. on to the next
[4:22:54] xgoldpt: And Liquid gets the RAID before ECHO lol
[4:22:54] emznev: eu just have better gaming chairs
[4:22:55] nouwandhi: This race would never be fair with one Guild starting 8h earlier
[4:22:57] Malnar1123: Everyone thinking Max will be sad hasn't seen his bank account Kappa
[4:23:00] deggon777: Btw Happy Christmas Eve Eve
[4:23:00] Madnezz123: You reduce Echo's effort by saying they won cause of the nerf. They were outstanding, they deserve it
[4:23:02] Alsparq: @Towelliee how much did it help that Echo got to learn from Liquids mistakes
[4:23:02] MourvinMad: @GIJosh86 ah ok i could see that being a thing
[4:23:04] Shrenko: @Towelliee where are the nerfs at?
[4:23:05] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee the sad part is, they will make changes in the liquid org now.  after this many losses.  which breaks the consistency.  This is not a sports team...

[4:23:07] WeaponII: Needing Liquid to find a few more pumpers for next tier
[4:23:10] nouwandhi: Not 1 guild buy US guilds
[4:23:14] Thoreya: sub only

[4:23:22] Jericco8: sub only^^
[4:23:23] honeybadger1113: its clear that one guild has better leadership then the other simple
[4:23:23] cabalish: sub only

[4:23:25] Archiee: casters already left i think
[4:23:29] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 pull count doesn’t tell the whole story either, echo takes more time between pulls
[4:23:31] manmower: Race to Nerf First
[4:23:32] SamuraiWillZ916: as bad as when the raiders got screwed from the SB win !!!
[4:23:32] CharpieX: i wish they would wait til both teams were playing to nerf. for all nerfs
[4:23:33] hercybrah: KEKW
[4:23:39] rosina_scarlett: Max's stream is in sub only @Towelliee
[4:23:39] Firedexx: Limit done as a guild?
[4:23:40] Aegllor: Liquid is airing a rebroadcast
[4:23:42] dwolters_the_zombieman: i dont consider echo win a real win
[4:23:45] Shrenko: @Towelliee where can we read the nerfs
[4:23:45] royhandlesit: Sub only cuz RWS
[4:23:50] darthvapor420: yeah his celebrations are hype
[4:24:00] Gozzy: how did you guys find out its been hotfixed? where's the news?
[4:24:01] Niksen_99: Or a 16 hour headstart? comon bro @dreamwalker213
[4:24:01] eyemyor: Roger is just a general great human being
[4:24:02] cabalish: he knows things
[4:24:02] SAMBBA1: @dwolters_the_zombieman why not?
[4:24:03] LearnedSomething: they're all good guys
[4:24:03] WeaponII: Max is probably going to send the boys home since today was their last day at the performance center
[4:24:04] KoalaTeaTime: why not let the guilds know when the nerf is coming in so they can both be online when it happens
[4:24:05] avgjohnson52: sock on head drunk?
[4:24:06] anord999: I wondered if Echo was going to do it before Liquid got up but didnt think off a nerf.
[4:24:10] rosina_scarlett: Roger is the best player in Echo tbh
[4:24:14] eaglerydr: Echo was behind going into all three of those last bosses so there is a pattern.
[4:24:18] jeffnsteff2019: liquid gave it good push i think they lost their patience and energy finsih it frustration kicked in
[4:24:18] anord999: but i have been watching as i can
[4:24:21] citrinesoan: all gold everything towellie remix! lol i like hip hop and goldieshaman.
[4:24:22] Reckless_Monk: scripe confirmed that the rings were ajusted to be dealayed 6-7sec
[4:24:24] jaalexba: @avgjohnson52 Underwear headband
[4:24:25] mavericks312: echos chats are about to be hella toxic
[4:24:25] aceventus: @Towelliee random pivot question, how good was pappy 10 year?
[4:24:25] gritbarontv: lol
[4:24:26] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal during the WoW:Dragonflight marathons. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[4:24:28] helimecha: so where is nerf proof? i cant find anything
[4:24:40] eyemyor: Scripe is a king right now.
[4:24:45] darkrowse21: I watched liquid untill the stream went down last nite
[4:24:46] cabalish: wax that boy
[4:24:47] LoseAlotLuke: mans got headset hair
[4:24:48] Drogdorf: Headset hair KEKW
[4:24:51] stallowned: lol
[4:24:52] Blessedheals: Get he new "echo" Gel for $9.99 today!
[4:24:52] PigPenLen: LUL LUL
[4:24:54] Madnezz123: @eaglerydr of course they were behind with 16 hours headstart in NA
[4:24:57] Raafuh: The back your head is ridiculous! Lol
[4:25:00] Lulaboo: Liquid guild probably not done as a guild. There is always a rebroadcast of the day before until the start of the raid day which for Liquid was hella late this tier
[4:25:01] Wrizzik: @LoseAlotLuke this 100%
[4:25:03] emznev: PogChamp
[4:25:05] LosDuervo: Major gamer hair
[4:25:08] tocu: meeres also seems like the Professor X of echo  hes likely the mvp
[4:25:10] infektyd: clearly visable on the killing pull how much slower it was, and it was datamined on wowhead or mmo champ
[4:25:10] Hexxdecc: When was the last time liquid won rwf?
[4:25:10] Taynk_: that hair is a member in itself
[4:25:13] moxing_hei: main wow twitter congarts echo lol
[4:25:17] Athinzi: @Raafuh Lol
[4:25:24] im_capy: Gingi tweet looking better now
[4:25:31] KoalaTeaTime: LOL
[4:25:34] Lulaboo: Weather or not Team Liquid as an org wants to keep doing something like this is another thing entirely
[4:25:44] SkypexOnline: excuses excuses
[4:25:44] royhandlesit: wooowowowowowow
[4:25:45] Reckless_Monk: Exactly
[4:25:46] DeanoTV: Echo played great they deserve the win :D
[4:25:52] SazSanity: yeah agree the nerf was at a horrible time but gaging when the nerfs were coming in liquid should have changed there schedule to start earlier to be pulling when they nerfs are coming  not to start almost mid day
[4:25:57] jeffnsteff2019: would love see liquid fihgt back in next raid and take it from EU and say they still got gonads be WF raid team
[4:25:59] PigPenLen: Only took them 263 pulls
[4:26:03] LearnedSomething: the best team won
[4:26:08] jeffnsteff2019: that nerf is a joke
[4:26:08] JustinSutherby: I wanted sloot to win
[4:26:09] Metket: at least they didn't start at the same time, so unfair
[4:26:25] im_capy: 8% Vs 14% going into the nerf
[4:26:25] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:26:29] kowaikokoro: LUL
[4:26:31] Ryvden: liquid stream just went offline
[4:26:35] wickedmgg: this raid should of went live after the holidays anyway
[4:26:36] WainDOC: Naowh best tank in da world!
[4:26:43] gritbarontv: their employees are priority, :)
[4:26:47] cabalish: it will be analysed
[4:26:49] Rudric_Ice: so is BLIZZ the grinch ?
[4:26:49] spookychefkarolina: I’m stressed
[4:26:50] Serebus: Chat complaining, when the shields were nerfed right when echo went to bed
[4:26:53] LeXieSterling: Who hungry for it
[4:26:53] Shrenko: just dont sleep 4Head
[4:26:53] Lastprayer: Those hotfix timings are pretty terrible
[4:26:54] sdpercussion: @Towelliee Absolutely. its 10am and they haven't started yet
[4:26:55] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: @Metket i agree. it should start for everyone the same time like when they release expansion
[4:26:55] Malnar1123: How was Liquid supposed to know it'd be at 9:30 and not at 11:30?
[4:26:56] Molvonos: Rigged, BDGG should have won
[4:26:56] emznev: echo had it either way towIgnit
[4:26:57] Serebus: The better guild won the race
[4:27:02] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 dumbest take in the book, echo gets strays before starting and mostly fights post nerf bosses
[4:27:03] Moobot:  ADV.GG Sponsor - https://advanced.gg/products/towellie-starter-kit/?ref=Towelliee | CODE "TOWEL" AT CHECKOUT | https://advanced.gg/?ref=Towelliee
[4:27:03] breadwilton: WAit there was a nerf today??
[4:27:05] ea_quinn: It is 10am PST, get the heck out of bed
[4:27:10] Drogdorf: Like 100 less pulls aswell
[4:27:14] Zephz0r: Blizzard couldve just locked the raid over the holiday, wouldnt that been fair?
[4:27:15] Hexxdecc: listen to this guy LUL
[4:27:22] im_capy: @Molvonos towChad
[4:27:26] SourSpence: why couldnt it be like a 24 hour notice
[4:27:28] EasilyZeroed: Echo had it all the way down to 8% lol
[4:27:31] sdpercussion: @Towelliee Who cares about the nerf. Your competition was ALREADY doing sub 10% pulls. Get TF outa bed before 10
[4:27:34] winraider: But you have to admit they were ahead
[4:27:37] Noshpan: It did seem that Max expected Echo to win when they had finished for the night.
[4:27:40] Archiee: one team came to win, the other came to meme
[4:27:45] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: agreed
[4:27:49] MIKEBRASKA: Preach on that copium lol, "altered", thats a huge nerf kekl
[4:27:52] xdonoghan: shush
[4:27:55] ottavianni: damn blizz took an L just before christmas
[4:27:57] WeaponII: I mean one pull from Echo they went from 45 to like 20%
[4:28:05] manmower: build in a holiday pause
[4:28:08] layali1698: Team liquid is live notification 😬
[4:28:12] Shrenko: shutting down Razageth mythic HAPPY CHRISTMAS FUCKERS
[4:28:12] Xara36: smarter idea
[4:28:12] mavericks312: the echo astros lol
[4:28:14] Hexxdecc: that would be better
[4:28:17] Niksen_99: Whatever man the best guild by a mile won :D @dreamwalker213
[4:28:18] AvrithSATX: I think Blizz did nothing wrong. If you're conducting a race, and the teams aren't competing at the same time, then boo hoo if one team benefits from changes that the other doesn't. That's not on Blizz who wasn't running the race, it's on the coordinators.
[4:28:20] Cheapesttactics1: why does no one like doing ruby life pool?
[4:28:23] emznev: @ottavianni nah blizzard nothing but Ws lately Kreygasm
[4:28:24] MIKEBRASKA: @layali1698 same, I cringed haha
[4:28:25] 0doz: or what if they released the expa 1 week before.. ?
[4:28:26] DeanoTV: chat the nerf didn't matter LUL
[4:28:26] Madnezz123: Guilds would go mental
[4:28:29] LearnedSomething: hell
[4:28:30] darkrowse21: I can't wait to see next  raid tier
[4:28:31] DeanoTV: echo was gonna win anyway
[4:28:32] LearnedSomething: they put a hat on her
[4:28:32] jeffnsteff2019: i think devs need go in mythic and test fights and adjust and fix see what all those WF raiders go through
[4:28:33] LegendaryViewer: Nerfgate LUL
[4:28:37] LearnedSomething: don't you think that's an overreach
[4:28:38] PigPenLen: @mavericks312 hahaha good one!
[4:28:41] Cosmolus: Cosmolus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[4:28:50] emznev: @deanotv exactly
[4:28:53] narutoinblack: @avrithsatx good point.
[4:28:54] 0doz: @Towelliee  or what if blizz released the expa 1 week before.. ?
[4:28:55] DeanoTV: true
[4:28:58] breadwilton: Im out of the loop what is the big deal about nerfs?
[4:28:58] LearnedSomething: fr fr
[4:29:01] Cosmolus: echo was way ahead than liquid
[4:29:03] xmedpakx: hilarious handling of nerfs , regardless though Echo is so good they played so well
[4:29:05] mavericks312: if that nerf went out last night and liquid when eco was sleeping EU would be crying in there tea lets be honest
[4:29:06] cabalish: max staed in his chat
[4:29:08] Alsparq: Echo could have won but it would have been schedule dependant
[4:29:10] Cosmolus: deal with it people
[4:29:11] Naywils: They had an almost perfect run also
[4:29:15] im_capy: Too bad it couldnt be apart of Blizzcon somehow, obviously way too much to ask
[4:29:16] Alienfromger: except liquid kills it with first atte,pt too
[4:29:22] bisco_akaboshi: a bit overwelming
[4:29:28] sdpercussion: @Towelliee No, it would have been whoever was lucky to get a clean pull first. Both would have had a chance if they were both awake and raiding
[4:29:29] SAMBBA1: so much salty tears yum
[4:29:29] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:29:33] WQKPtheDON: if blizz employees get to work at 9am, i'm having my raid team on at 830am
[4:29:35] xhale2nhale: the sad thing is this nerf gonna undermine their win
[4:29:36] nocontextlive: max is typing in his chat
[4:29:36] Saucy722: Exactly ^^ trying to save themselves
[4:29:37] wickedmgg: it never should of came out before holiday yea
[4:29:42] royhandlesit: they werent forced to do anything
[4:29:46] Tartxo: yeah, this is Blizzard's fault
[4:29:46] Hexxdecc: but it will be more better if both teams are pulling
[4:29:47] ClassicMalcontent: I think it's great. I hope they massively overtune the next tiers as well. Then nerf at the right moment for max drama. RWF typically 'meh' for me. But this drama. I need to pop more popcorn for this one. Well done Blizz. Kappa
[4:29:48] jeffnsteff2019: xmas conspiracy
[4:29:49] tocu: Those devs every other year basically get 2 weeks off to include xmas and new years
[4:29:51] mavericks312: this win gets a huge asterisk
[4:29:52] wickedmgg: i swaid 7-10 the whole time..
[4:29:52] LegendaryViewer: Everything lame about this situation is 100% on Blizzard.
[4:29:53] Wrizzik: so boss buffs coming after Holiday? Kappa
[4:29:58] Eviltuna13: Why didn't Blizz just open mythic after the new year?
[4:30:01] Boxxss: Echo's kill try was almost perfect. they were all alive till the end
[4:30:07] MiddlePhaze: how can you tell it was a nerf????
[4:30:10] monute316: monute316 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 104 months! 
[4:30:12] flyingmachin3: the 6 second delay is a bit large
[4:30:13] Ashe_x: if liquid was going for the last 4 hours and was playing how they were last night, once the nerf came it was whoever had a better pull first which imo sucks. but echo played better there's no denying it
[4:30:14] Tartxo: I mean, Blizzard planned for the raid to be released for XMas time, this is on them
[4:30:15] AvrithSATX: This is 100% the fault of the race coordinators that didn't have the teams competing at the same time.
[4:30:17] valv00: imagine the mood @ liquid camp atm
[4:30:18] Naywils: Did you see the pull? was pretty clutch
[4:30:19] HonestPhilosophy: and 3 brezs
[4:30:20] WeaponII: with 2 rezzes
[4:30:21] emznev: 4 br
[4:30:22] WeaponII: TWO
[4:30:23] demonicyoshi: wht was the nerf?
[4:30:25] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 never said echo wasn’t better, but definitely not by a mile
[4:30:25] flyingmachin3: they had 3 brezs
[4:30:26] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @officerquil (warning)
[4:30:27] anord999: I wondered about the time difference but now that i know it was a nerf win ugh
[4:30:27] akacvrtops: I THINK IT WAS 3
[4:30:28] rosina_scarlett: Maximum: 10 am is one hour early and we didn't know they were coming, we were asleep. is what max just said on his stream @Towelliee
[4:30:29] im_capy: most casuals wont even care in the end, its the minority that will complain imo
[4:30:30] Madnezz123: @mavericks312 nope, its a well deserved win like all the others
[4:30:32] akacvrtops: 3BREZ
[4:30:34] Yngvezs: naowh has a vod
[4:30:35] rosina_scarlett: it's on wow head
[4:30:35] DukeRollo_: one person went down I believe but 2 bres
[4:30:36] Cosmolus: yeah theystill had 2 bres .
[4:30:37] Niksen_99: Maybe 10 miles? @dreamwalker213
[4:30:38] SilverFox_Gaming: Liquid going to come on and kill it in 30min
[4:30:40] jeffnsteff2019: cant wait see all all memes for that nerfgate
[4:30:42] bazziiiTV: they had everyone alive, 3 brez and the 4th coming up
[4:30:45] LearnedSomething: I saw it live, they were playing out of their minds
[4:30:49] 03Turbo03: Liquid last pull had everyone alive and 3 brez. That would have been the kill
[4:30:53] LearnedSomething: they had logrok make this play dude in p3
[4:30:56] Cosmolus: they used them when peopledied doing bombs and soaks
[4:30:57] eaglerydr: @madnezz123  so your logic is that with a headstart at the beginning of race then Echo should always be behind beating ever Bo’s until the last boss. I guess you are missing common sense logic.
[4:30:57] Niksen_99: Couple years in a row? @dreamwalker213
[4:30:57] LearnedSomething: you wouldn't believe it
[4:30:57] winraider: @towelliee listen to this ....Liquid got a 2 hours notice ahead the nerf....
[4:31:06] Anderus00: they didnt plan RWF was going to be around xmas before release? poor scheduling by blizz
[4:31:06] LegendaryViewer: Tow Replay Pog
[4:31:07] WSeveryn: @towelliee man almost feels like someone got payed off...
[4:31:17] skoll135: @winraider no they didnt
[4:31:21] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[4:31:26] citrinesoan: poppin bottles with towellie
[4:31:27] im_capy: math wizes
[4:31:31] emznev: @wseveryn towCopium towCopium
[4:31:32] WeaponII: Glad I got up in time to see the final pull
[4:31:37] akacvrtops: the timing of the nerf was bad regardless of how you look at it
[4:31:37] Wrizzik: LUL I just saw the boss's Santa hat
[4:31:40] Holysal: @WSeveryn nah echo is just better
[4:31:51] Shrenko: towLewd
[4:31:53] Plague_GG: HUH
[4:31:55] mo_dilly84: Is it true Blizz announced a nerf 2 hours before it happened? I was just in liquids chat and a Moderator posted that.
[4:31:55] LearnedSomething: naw they had to use some tricks man
[4:31:57] narutoinblack: That’s a small gift.
[4:32:01] papascruge: @Wrizzik got a candy cane and wreath in her hands too
[4:32:04] akacvrtops: it just doesn't feel as fair even though echo deserved it
[4:32:05] Zettabyte: And fuck COVID. Got it right before Christmas eve, so no family dinner for me :(
[4:32:10] MourvinMad: the phase 3 portal was pretty nutty
[4:32:13] eyemyor: Echo is great.  Liquid is almost as great.  Both guilds played their best.
[4:32:16] 0doz: @Towelliee  lets see what blizzz says about the implicance of the nerf .. "we have a 9th boss" .. xD
[4:32:21] Naywils: velo is it
[4:32:28] jetributions: damn twitch chat on the liquid channel ouch
[4:32:29] CarrKinn: Just feels real bad that Liquid were asleep when the nerfs were announced.
[4:32:29] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:32:30] Holysal: @mo_dilly84 yeah max said that and when out 20 mins ago
[4:32:31] winraider: some people from inside Luquid team are saying that they had 2 hours notice ahead of the nerf
[4:32:31] SilkeySmooth: the shaman replacement
[4:32:32] TheGiant99: This just shows what a who cares event this is
[4:32:35] emznev: @zettabyte feel better soon towComfy
[4:32:37] GingerGambit: Naowh tweeted about it
[4:32:37] jetributions: saying liquid who?
[4:32:42] narutoinblack: @zettabyte sorry to hear that, you from the States?
[4:32:56] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 again, each is better but every one of the races have been basically neck and neck besides jailer when liquid went home
[4:32:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tuskarr evoker!
[4:33:02] tocu: my only question now is did a santa hat drop ? if it did it should have been award like a game ball of the super bowl
[4:33:11] Yagr6: Funny how a nerf comes in and all of the casters of Echo are like "wow where did that come from" on the kill! But then the same casters are like the nerf had nothing to do with the kill LUL
[4:33:14] Zettabyte: Thanks guys <3
[4:33:15] haggis_chaser: zaelia built different
[4:33:27] Gozzy: shield nerfed twice if you countthat as seperate
[4:33:35] nevercluckyy: personal opinion i have always been a big fan of liquid because they are always really fun and the liquid rwf stream itself is always really well put together, but from a gameplay viewpoint the last few tiers liquid has just been playing subpar compared to nyalotha.
[4:33:45] Ashe_x: oh yeah the storm when they were at 20%
[4:33:46] rosina_scarlett: WOW THAT IS SLOW WTF
[4:33:46] Zettabyte: @narutoinblack Nah Norway here, and it's not that bad, and people have had it way worse than me :)
[4:33:47] Reckless_Monk: Look how slow that thing is
[4:33:48] Ashe_x: i laughed
[4:33:55] Hyelander_: The storm said "Ill be right there"
[4:34:03] Gozzy: its a 4min P3 instead of 3min
[4:34:07] rosina_scarlett: it is
[4:34:07] Reckless_Monk: HAHA
[4:34:09] Sarcastard: 20% slower
[4:34:10] abracka_: https://clips.twitch.tv/AdorableReliableAsparagusRaccAttack-ql1Rv_8ctF6ejpMD here's rodger's  POV
[4:34:11] kappaday23: Kappa
[4:34:11] Plague_GG: It’s probably half as slow as before
[4:34:12] LegendaryViewer: max talking
[4:34:13] WeaponII: I was about to say that's Heroic timings right there
[4:34:14] Keyastaron_: watch they revert it back Kapp

[4:34:28] CarrKinn: @Towelliee max is talking
[4:34:28] cyclonos: max talking
[4:34:30] Nurlitik: they probably didnt nerf it correctly lol
[4:34:37] Ryvden: apparently they were already on this attempt when Blizz announced the nerf in comp discord chat
[4:34:54] WainDOC: max is crying
[4:34:56] Ashe_x: the storm was hitting the inner circle around 20% before nerf
[4:35:04] Alsparq: Max is talki8ng
[4:35:04] MackaRoney: Isn't a coinflip better than when a group is racked out
[4:35:06] Alsparq: max is talking
[4:35:08] nevercluckyy: that storm should have been hotfixed with the family guy tuba sound as slow as its going

[4:35:52] tocu: @Wrizzik here i am wonder if that santa hat dropped I think the only one ever during a WF
[4:35:57] Gozzy: that's the silly part on blizz @Lostdogal
[4:35:58] citrinesoan: i got kicked out for looking at girls on the internet; i am at the library!
[4:36:01] Reckless_Monk: Max is talking.. said hes not happy with the nerf timing
[4:36:08] LearnedSomething: there it is
[4:36:12] BloodAngel420: Max is chatting about the kill
[4:36:21] Archiee: more like 3-5%
[4:36:22] mirasweetheart: so the storm = enrage right?
[4:36:23] DeanoTV: chat stop the nerf didnt matter
[4:36:23] citrinesoan: lololol haha you funny
[4:36:33] Lostdogal: @Gozzy for sure, they could have held off on that nerf I think
[4:36:33] im_capy: I dont think they will lose any sleep on it
[4:36:35] DeanoTV: the nerf was shit yes, but didnt matter
[4:36:57] rosina_scarlett: yeah Max just said they fly home tomorrow no matter what
[4:36:58] eaglerydr: The storm stopped in when it hit the gold@paltform
[4:37:04] Shrenko: Max is not happy with the nerfs
[4:37:05] Lulaboo: Max TLDR: The timing would never be optimal for anyone, it sucks to lose, GG's to Echo and no hard feelings
[4:37:09] surpriseparty20: I mean how out of touch can they be to NERF it that hard . Like for sure it needed a slight nerf but that shit ain't it LUL
[4:37:11] Metket: roger <3
[4:37:17] crunchyFrog999: 6.666% nerf to circle plz Kappa
[4:37:19] Niksen_99: Max just said if anything Echo got screwed over by the nerf timing. they were 10 hours into their day if they didnt kill it, liquid had the advantage
[4:37:23] PigPenLen: Max is a pro
[4:37:24] Yagr6: im sorry i know max is taking the high road but this is bullshit

[4:37:35] TheGiant99: when they where celebrating they didnt show the guy who nerfed it for them LOL
[4:37:36] Maydie6066: Can we talk about that awkward ass 1 handed hug front and center?
[4:37:39] Gozzy: i think that's just wher it got on timing
[4:37:48] rosina_scarlett: yeah it is
[4:37:48] TialePetit: It is still going in
[4:37:52] your_sister_2499: you mean liquid got screwed over not echo? lol
[4:37:53] KoalaTeaTime: I wish the top guild played in the same region so there wouldnt be any of these discussions
[4:37:57] Sudocomm: it paused for a bit
[4:38:01] Gozzy: they gave  the storm creep an extra minute
[4:38:02] Waffilios: These were the nerfs Max posted in his chat when he went live Slightly adjusted the timing of events at the start of phase 3. -Reduced the rate at which motes of Storm-Energy are spawned. -Slowed the rate that the Raging Storm closes in.
[4:38:05] ultvanquish: it was 2:30 to close PRE nerf
[4:38:14] firewalltwitch: liquid woulda 100% killed boss last night with these major nerfs lol
[4:38:14] MedicineMan: bruh 90k heals.
[4:38:17] eaglerydr: That delay is what made kill.
[4:38:20] deggon777: preach said they still had all their cooldowns on that pull left at the end if needed
[4:38:21] cyclonos: this what happens wjhen u dont test the last boss lat all
[4:38:33] flyingmachin3: can check the 8% wipe
[4:38:44] shadodefiant: @Towelliee but its over.  finally.  now for a more stable market and mdis :)

[4:38:44] Yagr6: the echo casters acting like the nerf meant nothing lmfao
[4:38:47] Shrenko: catJAM
[4:38:48] firewalltwitch: first wf race im disappointed in, no nerf shoulda happened last night
[4:38:48] Alsparq: @Towelliee There is not a GOOD time to nerf a boss someone always loses
[4:38:50] robokop365: @firewalltwitch Kappa
[4:38:54] Shrenko: today
[4:38:59] Gozzy: they got 8% at lunch about 5hrs ago
[4:39:02] Nathanonfire: it is what it is blizz has no ties to the race what so ever no matter when they nerf it its going to screw some one max said it him self ... but echo progged raz way ahead of liquid anyway
[4:39:03] CarrKinn: @Towelliee what is your take on Liquid having to spend/waste time on bosses earlier in the fight and wait for blizz nerfs for the kill?
[4:39:04] N3llee: echo hit 19% and went to bed
[4:39:09] emznev: @firewalltwitch LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:39:19] Exoleras: Exoleras subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:39:31] firewalltwitch: massive nerfs b4 they wake up, why ruin it lol
[4:39:33] Thoreya: the nerf made it so much fuckin easier lol
[4:39:53] firewalltwitch: @emznev i dont even like liqui,d i cheer for echo, but unearned
[4:39:56] Waffilios: the nerf was fucking massive
[4:39:56] royhandlesit: liquid in emote and sub only modes
[4:40:00] Yagr6: @Nathanonfire imagine a football team that came back in a game telling them yea since they played better in the first 3 quarters means u cant win lul
[4:40:04] firewalltwitch: why ruin the race
[4:40:07] emznev: @firewalltwitch echo had it either way ggs
[4:40:11] Reckless_Monk: they really need to start releasing raids after the holidays
[4:40:16] bygodwest: two things can be true at once. Echo was playing better and the nerf screwed the race
[4:40:24] nKoalaBear: popout?
[4:40:26] nocontextlive: open new tab
[4:40:28] Wrizzik: @Towelliee hide both chats

[4:40:35] mystic_charmer: muti twich
[4:40:36] Reckless_Monk: that first tier is badly released
[4:40:40] odtee: someone had to win today though, ideally the nerf could have been done after liquid was back for an hour or so
[4:40:44] LearnedSomething: use https://multitwitch.live/
[4:40:52] Dandalionn: theTer mode
[4:40:53] LearnedSomething: use multitwitch dot live
[4:41:01] nKoalaBear: arrow keys to skip 5 seconds
[4:41:03] Alsparq: PUT BOTH BOSSES AT 40%
[4:41:03] firewalltwitch: @emznev if liquid got the nerfs id feel the same, it was bullshit
[4:41:03] manmower: well there's always next race, i guess we'll never know who would have won this one
[4:41:10] firewalltwitch: esports lol
[4:41:12] KoalaTeaTime: start it as their characters land

[4:41:47] Yagr6: at the end of the day this wasnt echo wining it , it was blizzard ending it b4 xmas
[4:41:47] sdpercussion: theatre mode them
[4:41:48] Nathanonfire: @Yagr6 echo played better the whole raid lol it took liquid 6 days to reach raz echo did it in 5
[4:41:50] Reckless_Monk: 40 vs 41
[4:41:57] Havoc_Sinistr: RWF is a esport?
[4:42:02] Necrootide: did echo get the kill?

[4:42:09] BullDevil: @firewalltwitch you do know RWF isn't an esport right?
[4:42:09] firewalltwitch: @luciwho liquid wouldve killed it last night thoguh with those nerfs, ur missing the point
[4:42:26] Yagr6: @Nathanonfire and? u ever seen a tom brady 4th Q comeback?
[4:42:29] Gorxuk: forsenThink
[4:42:29] firewalltwitch: they try to sell it as one, i know its not, thats the joke
[4:42:32] CDubTheRIPper: they got the kill?? towPog
[4:42:38] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: they still have to pass the drug test before it's official
[4:42:42] gritbarontv: looks the same
[4:42:43] royhandlesit: big time analysis
[4:42:53] Waffilios: They also changed other stuff than the storm
[4:42:55] Waffilios: Slightly adjusted the timing of events at the start of phase 3. -Reduced the rate at which motes of Storm-Energy are spawned. -Slowed the rate that the Raging Storm closes in.
[4:42:56] LegendaryViewer: VAR LUL
[4:42:59] Reckless_Monk: Oh wow
[4:43:00] surpriseparty20: It's way faster
[4:43:00] Gozzy: they got an extra minute. that was the nerf
[4:43:03] CDubTheRIPper: yeah it is KEKW
[4:43:03] nKoalaBear: its so much faster
[4:43:03] mavericks312: nah that storm is moving lol
[4:43:06] royhandlesit: yup
[4:43:06] Reckless_Monk: NO SHOT
[4:43:10] charizard_main: Left is faster
[4:43:13] nKoalaBear: that is insane
[4:43:15] Gorxuk: True
[4:43:17] bygodwest: yea pretty big nerf
[4:43:17] Syntrium: MERRY CHRISTMAS TOWELLIEE!!!!
[4:43:18] firewalltwitch: massive nerfs, jesus
[4:43:24] demonicyoshi: they are also 2% faster
[4:43:24] manmower: the movement space woof
[4:43:25] jeffnsteff2019: they just handicapped boss
[4:43:25] DukeRollo_: and a 4% difference
[4:43:33] Reckless_Monk: 10yrds
[4:43:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it was definitely faster
[4:43:35] demonicyoshi: 15 yerds
[4:43:38] royhandlesit: 15
[4:43:40] shadodefiant: 45 seconds more really
[4:43:41] demonicyoshi: yards*
[4:43:43] Reckless_Monk: 15
[4:43:43] kimmo_gaming: 2
[4:43:44] surpriseparty20: 15 ish
[4:43:45] manmower: they basically gave them like twice as much space to work with
[4:43:45] sdpercussion: boss health was apparently also nerfed 30mil @Towelliee
[4:43:49] Reckless_Monk: Jesus
[4:43:49] Niksen_99: Look how perfect they play man insane
[4:43:50] kimmo_gaming: 20
[4:43:50] mavericks312: the next blizz video and streams are gonna have comments disabled lol
[4:43:51] im_capy: they took a lot more dmg in the 8% run at times
[4:43:57] clambynature: I would not have nerfed the boss until after Christmas, once they got sub 15%
[4:44:03] BloodAngel420: Woah look at that storm
[4:44:05] shadodefiant: @Towelliee bajheera summoned u :)
[4:44:07] charizard_main: Theyre outta space already
[4:44:18] firewalltwitch: blizzard really wanted to go home early, lmao
[4:44:19] bdobbi: Detective Tow spitting facts
[4:44:25] Thoreya: Pretty drastic difference lol
[4:44:27] Reckless_Monk: Thatr push kills
[4:44:28] Yagr6: yep thats the diff
[4:44:30] bygodwest: thats a huge fucking difference and youre either blind or biased if you cant tell
[4:44:31] shadodefiant: all i see is a nerf was needed
[4:44:32] scenario17: Easier to pump harder when it’s nerfed
[4:44:35] xgoldpt: It doesnt matter, Echo was already ahead.
[4:44:43] Havoc_Sinistr: Global release and you don’t have to worry about when you put out a nerf… they are uninterested in the race for whatever reason..
[4:44:44] mmo_kenna_: Copium, well deserved Echo
[4:44:44] Waffilios: @Towelliee another big thing is that the soaks happened way less often
[4:44:45] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:44:45] Wrizzik: that was at least 30% nerf on storm rate
[4:44:52] Yagr6: and preach acting like the nerf was nothing, sorry fuck that guy
[4:44:55] Thoreya: Gives u prob an extra 30-45 secs to kill
[4:45:01] Miracleshot: its so much time on the nerf
[4:45:01] DeanoTV: never seen NA this salty KEKW
[4:45:04] firewalltwitch: @xgoldpt wrong, liquid kills it last ngiht with equal nerfs, terrible ending
[4:45:07] Allydian: yeah, cheat
[4:45:13] mozavich: @Towelliee blizzard can't win either way with this event. if liquid killed it first, eu would have been like "of course they killed it first, they got 24 hours head start".
[4:45:15] manmower: the refs called the game at the top of the 8th inning
[4:45:16] odtee: fact is the nerf wasn't echos fault, they were 100 pulls less and 5% ahead of liquid and getting ready for pizza break. they deserved ut!
[4:45:20] LegendaryViewer: @DeanoTV COPIUM
[4:45:26] Metket: with that pull they probably still would kill it
[4:45:33] LearnedSomething: cool
[4:45:34] xhale2nhale: the nerf was something like lets not pretend but they got their victory
[4:45:35] scenario17: Their pull was so clean though
[4:45:36] PigPenLen: thats a lot more time
[4:45:37] firewalltwitch: COPIUM earned kill Kappa
[4:45:38] LearnedSomething: everyone gets to spend xmas with family
[4:45:39] neo_0098: cringe
[4:45:40] Yagr6: point is it ruins the race
[4:45:41] Gorxuk: forsenLUL
[4:45:42] anord999: wow  all i can say
[4:45:43] N3llee: can someone clip that
[4:45:45] Alsparq: dps is so much easier when you have room
[4:45:45] breadwilton: But didnt Liquid spend most of their pulls on unnerfed Ras?
[4:45:50] gritbarontv: plus one was pumping harder still
[4:45:53] odtee: will liquid try to kill still?
[4:45:54] mavericks312: "earned" he said lmao
[4:45:55] Barret: lame ending to the race
[4:46:00] ma1ef1c: yeah because people think they were 8% dps better ine one pull lmao
[4:46:00] Nehcrom: Drama twitter towel :P
[4:46:00] ClassicMalcontent: Race to world L U L Z
[4:46:01] firewalltwitch: imagine if they nerfed the boss last night pepelaugh
[4:46:02] TheGiant99: Lame race
[4:46:06] shadodefiant: @Yagr6 no  point is nerf was needed and echo was already cleaner pulls.
[4:46:10] mmo_kenna_: NA on copium hard right now
[4:46:12] demonicyoshi: yea
[4:46:14] Vecter39: correct
[4:46:15] rosina_scarlett: yeah
[4:46:17] MIKEBRASKA: absolutely
[4:46:18] eaglerydr: Right
[4:46:18] repnol_: agree
[4:46:20] surpriseparty20: oh for sure
[4:46:21] dwolters_the_zombieman: cheat is a cheat and i will not consider a tainted win
[4:46:21] demonicyoshi: cause liquid got to 4%
[4:46:21] Metket: true actually
[4:46:23] ultvanquish: whatever time the nerf was done, someone was getting an advantage. The raid shouldnt of happened during the holidays
[4:46:25] Gorxuk: Yep
[4:46:28] LegendaryViewer: towCopium Nerf didn't matter
[4:46:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I think that 8% attempt would have gotten it in nerfed conditions
[4:46:29] dreamwalker213: Echo was only like 2-3%  ahead of where they died at before. Not 8% lol
[4:46:30] Ryvden: the pull was ongoing when the nerf was applied the raiders didnt even know yet lol
[4:46:30] xhale2nhale: yea Max said the same thing in a way, either way both team wouldve been screwed on the nerf
[4:46:31] mavericks312: the echo astros lol
[4:46:31] neo_0098: their reactions on the World first kills are always so cringe ugh
[4:46:32] Alsparq: both teams were regularly wiping on that storm
[4:46:33] omidiart: @Towelliee crazy race.
[4:46:35] rosina_scarlett: @demonicyoshi 14%
[4:46:39] Yagr6: @Fear_The_Reaper bro you ever watch football and seen a comback? u dont rob liquid of their chance
[4:46:42] Chuckforfun: any news about the nerf?
[4:46:44] shadodefiant: i couldnt die that many times to one boss and still be playing.  i dont have that fortitude
[4:46:51] im_capy: I wonder if liquid gets mental fatigue with more pulls
[4:46:51] omidiart: @Towelliee Liquid still has more world first kills this tier anyway! lol
[4:46:51] LoremasterMarthan: Xyronic twet calling it "mickey mouse shit" LUL
[4:46:56] CrusaderNero: EU Clap
[4:46:58] demonicyoshi: @rosina_scarlett 14% thanks you
[4:47:00] 03Turbo03: Liquid had a similar last pull watch that vid
[4:47:00] Sliccs: Doesn’t matter. It’s the principal above all. They should have waited until they were both actually RAIDING.
[4:47:00] Holysal: @mmo_kenna_ nah just took the hype out for the echo win is all
[4:47:01] breadwilton: How hard is it for Blizzard to announce the change before they make it in Comp Discord so all teams have a fair chance lol but w/e
[4:47:01] Getitonthelow: lol what happened to suck it fuck it group?
[4:47:04] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: FBI forced Blizzard to nerf the fight Kappa
[4:47:04] demonicyoshi: thank*
[4:47:05] LuciWho: Exactly they was in front well deserved
[4:47:06] manmower: blizzard employee
[4:47:07] anord999: it still would have been nice to have the nerf when they both were on and pulling and see who did it first.
[4:47:07] Reckless_Monk: They need to stop making these raid releases during Holidays. Blizzard then does stupid shit like this
[4:47:07] Niksen_99: Its 15 now :) @dreamwalker213
[4:47:09] eaglerydr: Echo towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:47:10] danimoto10: lol
[4:47:17] shadodefiant: @Yagr6 no...f football imo.  but i see ur point.  tho one is na one is eu...timing just sucked either way but fact in end is echo was still the cleaner team overall per kill
[4:47:18] cyclonos: they called it mickey moouse shit lolk
[4:47:18] pereadin: pay em whatever they want for the next race
[4:47:18] DeanoTV: poor NA awww PJSalt PJSalt
[4:47:18] mozavich: @Towelliee blizzard can't win either way with this event. if liquid killed it first, eu would have been like "of course they killed it first, they got 24 hours head start". if echo killed it first, it was "oh, the nerfs timing suited them".
[4:47:22] omidiart: @Towelliee wait is there really a guy that does DPS analysis? like they sim everyone's gear?
[4:47:23] firewalltwitch: @towelliee blizzard would've nerfed it last night once echo went to bed, thats an equal comparison
[4:47:24] ma1ef1c: good play doesn't make up for 8% on their cleanest pull lmao
[4:47:25] mavericks312: lebrons mickey mouse ring is more legit then this win lol
[4:47:26] Coloredtoad: Why would that person want to leave the #1 guild lol
[4:47:26] ClassicMalcontent: They just give a little 'side cut' to a dev or two. Kappa
[4:47:28] Kinghorn: what a load of horseshit
[4:47:28] emznev: EU on top things I love to see towBeer
[4:47:30] Duroth: so poach Scripe?
[4:47:41] Phoxzy: I blame common core math. LMAO
[4:47:43] jonertoner14: So happy echo won
[4:47:47] Reckless_Monk: nope
[4:47:49] rosina_scarlett: @Towelliee Roger seems like the main RL and always has. hes just so big brain with the starts and math

[4:47:51] Shrenko: no
[4:47:51] CarrKinn: what is your take on Liquid having to spend/waste time on bosses earlier in the race and wait for blizz nerfs for the kill?
[4:47:53] jilech: both guilds were informed 2 hour ahead of hot fix
[4:47:54] DeanoTV: EU chat stand up Clap
[4:47:55] Reckless_Monk: Scripe does not
[4:47:56] Getitonthelow: lol liquid acted like they had it in the bag
[4:47:57] shadodefiant: all in end is...its OVER yay.  now for MDI and xmas :)
[4:47:58] cyclonos: they have about 5 analyst

[4:48:00] mavericks312: @jonertoner14 you forgot the ***
[4:48:01] MrGrimms: So max said that the nerf was announced to both teams 2 hours ago, and implemented around 930am.. But it contained Slightly adjusted timing of events at the start of phase 3. -Reduced the rate at which motes of Storm-Energy are spawned. -Slowed the rate that the Raging Storm closes in
[4:48:03] Yagr6: liquid was robbed of thier chance to wake up and have a god pull
[4:48:05] honeybadger1113: maybe higher ppl that play the game idk
[4:48:08] 03Turbo03: How can you say that liquid had a vary similar pull last night
[4:48:11] RandomizeMike: Isnt echo mostly method ex raiders
[4:48:12] CrusaderNero: is NA mad now?
[4:48:12] rosina_scarlett: @jilech but Liquid was sleeping
[4:48:14] Nathanonfire: max just said they had no idea of the hotfix
[4:48:14] kennn_y: But liquid was sleeping still so they said they didnt see it until they woke up
[4:48:15] Shrenko: they have a guy from warcraftlogs
[4:48:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: The analysts go over the logs and figure out how to optimize timings
[4:48:21] Lokajin: ya one guild was literally just crawling outta bed and still had to travel to the studio lol
[4:48:22] LearnedSomething: I think liquid knew
[4:48:24] thor798: Max said on stream he had no idea they were nerfing it
[4:48:26] anord999: would have looked better with both teams on and pulling
[4:48:28] TheGiant99: they should of released while they both where raiding
[4:48:32] SilkeySmooth: lol now it doesnt matter
[4:48:33] neo_0098: smelly gamers getting a World first Kill
[4:48:34] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 what’re you talking about lol I was talking about both of those echo pulls
[4:48:35] jonertoner14: @mavericks312 I’m from texas, been echo fans since kj
[4:48:35] emznev: why didn't liquid just wake up early
[4:48:36] jacnut: I blame everyone who said I will never need this math after high school
[4:48:36] firewalltwitch: why not wait, and let them go head to head, echo still wins probably, but why ruin the race
[4:48:42] ultvanquish: @Yagr6 someone said it earlier, If we know blizz is in the office at 9, my raiders are getting on at 830. fk their sleep
[4:48:47] kennn_y: he said they knew
[4:48:48] CoolSax98: It was a super clean pull too
[4:48:51] kennn_y: but they were asleep
[4:48:53] LuciWho: @Lovaclol Check maxs vod hes says blizzard announced the nerfs 2hrs before
[4:48:54] Shrenko: Blizzard = '' wooops 😳 ''
[4:48:56] ClassicMalcontent: Press N to Nerf. "N" oh look world first. Kappa
[4:48:56] kennn_y: so they didnt see until he woke up
[4:48:57] Gozzy: yea, i don't tihnk  they saw them finding almost 10% dps in an extra minute
[4:49:03] Raafuh: Everyone at Blizzard right now ScaredyCat
[4:49:06] nhuh: WH OMEGALUL
[4:49:08] Shrenko: towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit
[4:49:10] eaglerydr: Echo usually pulls smart not just to pull Liquid pulls to pull more
[4:49:10] Roth___: With it being that close they should have waited, but either way Echo just played really well.
[4:49:10] LearnedSomething: no I mean I think liquid knew they were going to lose this one
[4:49:11] Teriyakibro: Who said it that I said what I said KEKW
[4:49:18] CDubTheRIPper: KEKW
[4:49:21] demonicyoshi: discipline from liquid compared to echo, echo always has a better mental
[4:49:26] emznev: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:49:27] Keyastaron_: you did i remember that
[4:49:37] CDubTheRIPper: yeah it is
[4:49:39] Thicc_Fil_A: OOF
[4:49:40] manmower: gotta cut out that insider trading
[4:49:40] TialePetit: @Yagr6 Ult.. 100%.. Liquid could have been prepared for a very likely nerf this close to the days that Blizz will be on holidays.
[4:49:40] cyclonos: boss should have been tested to begin with
[4:49:41] CDubTheRIPper: thats insider info
[4:49:41] Bartokus: @towelliee Naowh Robin made a tweet about the nerf and how it felt unfair even though they wad ahead
[4:49:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember that
[4:49:44] kennn_y: Max said they were told about nerfs 2 hours before, but they were asleep so didnt see until they woke up.
[4:49:47] ClassicMalcontent: Yes. It's insider info. Like insider 'trading' but info for the RWF.
[4:49:48] KoalaTeaTime: true
[4:49:48] shadodefiant: blizz has nothing to do with wfr tho.  the guild companies set it up lol
[4:49:49] emznev: towClap towClap towClap
[4:49:53] Thicc_Fil_A: Thats hot garbage
[4:49:53] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: race to world last is harder anyway
[4:49:55] CloudPants8081: atpSpiner
[4:49:56] manmower: that isn't the first time this happened
[4:49:56] royhandlesit: I 'member
[4:50:00] PotbellyGoat: towTinfoil
[4:50:03] mozavich: insider raiding
[4:50:05] firewalltwitch: @demonicyoshi but thats not why they won, liquid woulda killed last night too, race ruined
[4:50:05] Raafuh: BibleThump blizzard right meow ScaredyCat
[4:50:06] Thoreya: No max did know
[4:50:06] SilkeySmooth: thats bad..lol
[4:50:07] Tartxo: wait what
[4:50:08] Zerohz1: max said him self that they knew about it 2 hours before
[4:50:09] MeisterPetze: SO the race is rigged?
[4:50:10] lotro__: Max said they knew 2 hours before it went live
[4:50:10] Thoreya: But they were sleeping
[4:50:12] CoolSax98: max didn't say that
[4:50:13] Sagevaulk: I remember that
[4:50:16] Yagr6: @TialePetit u missing the point
[4:50:16] kennn_y: Max said they were told about nerfs 2 hours before, but they were asleep so didnt see until they woke up.
[4:50:16] emznev: towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil
[4:50:18] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @carrkinn (warning)
[4:50:19] DukeRollo_: yeah and gingi even reset the boss shortly after scripe saying there was a nerf
[4:50:19] cabalish: scribe and max both knew the same time
[4:50:22] anord999: Blizz just needs to stay out of it
[4:50:22] Dannyboy4477: Tainted race to world first
[4:50:23] eaglerydr: There should be no communication other than to report bugs.
[4:50:23] Thicc_Fil_A: Kinda soft core cheating
[4:50:23] iamdjremedy: Liquid is about to give it a shot
[4:50:24] Thoreya: They knew. But they were sleeping
[4:50:24] Raafuh: Someone said insider raiding lol
[4:50:24] jeffnsteff2019: should be a pull cap before boss gets nerfed
[4:50:26] scenario17: No, Max said he knew 2 hours before that there was a hot fix coming. They didn’t know when they were going to implement it though.
[4:50:27] TialePetit: @Fear_The_Reaper Well Blizz has a decent thing to do with it.. since they are the ones who woul decide on nerfs and when they are placed live
[4:50:27] 03Turbo03: Because they we’re always first
[4:50:28] royhandlesit: @kritkat1 I am undereated world last
[4:50:28] mozavich: insider raiding confirmed!
[4:50:30] Tartxo: I agree
[4:50:33] MrGrimms: @CoolSax98 Max did say it on stream about 20 mins ago lol
[4:50:35] Marc_ggnn: True
[4:50:35] Barret: what an awful way to end the race, ruined
[4:50:38] lotro__: Yes he did in his stream about 20 minutes ago
[4:50:38] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal during the WoW:Dragonflight marathons. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[4:50:38] RandomizeMike: If Liquids first pull today is a kill the the hot ruined the race imo
[4:50:39] SuperLost89: @Towelliee Max said they didnt know because they were sleeping. all guilds got the same info
[4:50:39] ultvanquish: @CoolSax98 if u were watching his stream, u would see that he did indeed say it
[4:50:42] dwolters_the_zombieman: well rwf is tainted
[4:50:43] Provision_: Yeah Max knew about 2 nerfs before echo, Echo decided to raid at 5am while Liquid decided to sleep to 10am.
[4:50:45] Bartokus: Naowh Robin tweet 👀👀👀
[4:50:45] Shrenko: true
[4:50:46] Affiiance: The RWF is just turning into a Clown Show towRee
[4:50:50] SilkeySmooth: liquid was told ahead of time its ggs wake up and raid
[4:50:50] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:50:50] koldar_nemesis: Towellie is right
[4:50:57] gritbarontv: unless, blizz had money involved, then it not wrong.
[4:50:59] CloudPants8081: atpCap just make wow for casuals
[4:51:00] WeaponII: I think the only reason is for game breaking bugs during the RWF, though.
[4:51:02] rosina_scarlett: https://twitter.com/naowhxd/status/1606349350468292634
[4:51:03] LeXieSterling: That is correct. It is not fair for sure
[4:51:05] Reckless_Monk: Yeo
[4:51:06] rosina_scarlett: love this tweet @Towelliee
[4:51:13] jmalmin: Atleast the players now gets to celebrate Christmas
[4:51:13] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: i had chicken fingers and pepsi for lunch today Kappa
[4:51:14] PvtHudson093: Casters said that the update about the nerf only came in while echo were mid kill pull
[4:51:15] Taynk_: if blizzard is gonna tell people about a nerf coming it should be posted on a help twitter or in game notification. not told to an individual
[4:51:17] eaglerydr: Agree
[4:51:18] WeaponII: As far as nerfs? Nobody should've been informed
[4:51:26] odtee: well blizz is too cheap to test their own mythic bosses
[4:51:29] ultvanquish: YO if you are HARDcore, during this whole race, your getting on for pulls WELL before blizz gets into office. I think liquid goofed
[4:51:35] mozavich: blizzard gate: blizzard fixing races confirmed!
[4:51:36] koldar_nemesis: yeah
[4:51:37] AvrithSATX: I still say the problem is that the teams weren't competing concurrently. Blizz wasn't coordinating the race and so you can't blame them if one team got an edge over another b/c of their scheduling.
[4:51:37] MrGrimms: @Towelliee I just want to say that your overlays and artwork are always on point <3
[4:51:39] Thoreya: Very right
[4:51:40] CloudPants8081: timezones Kappa
[4:51:53] LeXieSterling: This is also people money on the line...
[4:51:54] manmower: they should swap to FF14 raiding
[4:52:02] halfchubstrangler: they can be mad....but Echo's pulls were definitely better and it seems like the best guild won
[4:52:02] omidiart: @Towelliee sorry, so liquid was asleep and Echo beat the nerfed boss?
[4:52:03] LeXieSterling: You just don't play with peoples money
[4:52:03] jacnut: blizzard should have a laison at each facility
[4:52:05] Thicc_Fil_A: DAMN LUL
[4:52:05] firewalltwitch: they fact echo knew about the nerfs b4 max is hilarious
[4:52:05] Provision_: But Liquid could had predicted this and go early since they want to close this up before chrismas
[4:52:06] emznev: towOof
[4:52:08] Thicc_Fil_A: thats so scuffed
[4:52:17] bazziiiTV: max said on stream the nerfs were announced 2 hours ago to both teams @Towelliee
[4:52:17] cordawg: world first doesn't matter.  who cares
[4:52:17] jilech: Rogerbrown and Meares interviewed on echo channel
[4:52:19] CoolSax98: @ultvanquish maybe I misunderstood what he said
[4:52:21] LosDuervo: Should have been a 12 hour public notice prior to nerf being implemented. Give both guilds equal footing that way.
[4:52:22] neo_0098: Echo is the same as Bavaria Munich winning every season. it gets boring.
[4:52:24] Alienfromger: global release to hard towSip
[4:52:32] halfchubstrangler: Max even said they were more efficient on Raz specifically
[4:52:32] CloudPants8081: blame Microsoft Kappa
[4:52:32] manmower: who was on boss first pre-nerfs?
[4:52:39] demonicyoshi: idk about that they had a day ahead of echo an echo can learn from liquids fails
[4:52:40] OldManMitch: Echo didn't need the help from the refs to win, but they got it
[4:52:42] Lulaboo: Echo played out of thier minds. They are just. so. fucking. efficient.
[4:52:47] Niksen_99: If anything its a disadvantage for ECHO the timing!!! Echo was 10 hours in their session if they didnt kill the boss liquid had it on silver platter
[4:52:49] camarac: I still think the better guild won, even if Blizzard forced it, it wasn't an upset win
[4:52:49] LoremasterMarthan: END OF THE DAY, none of it would have been a thing if Blizz didnt decide the raid had to have a scheduled finish
[4:52:55] Holysal: @manmower liquid had more pulls prenerf
[4:52:55] mozavich: one could also argue that liquid had more attempts on the boss BECAUSE the boss was overtuned
[4:52:56] skylaars: ppl actually getting mad at your very reasonable (and correct) tweet is hilarious
[4:53:00] Baldarsar: ând in the end nobody gives a fuck because the race  is nonsense
[4:53:03] scenario17: @firewalltwitch they both knew the nerfs were coming. Echo has just happened to been on and in the raid for hours.
[4:53:03] bluen0te_: liquid always has higher pulls, thats their way
[4:53:04] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: sometimes the ref just throws a bad flag
[4:53:05] Ryvden: looks like Liquid is about to start their attempts
[4:53:06] anord999: liquid pulling
[4:53:06] dwolters_the_zombieman: it sounds like an excuse to me for a tainted win
[4:53:09] ClassicMalcontent: I think it would be amazing if everyone left the RWF but them. Make it a one guild "race". Kappa
[4:53:09] jeffnsteff2019: @neo_0098 or like roman reigns in wwe or Patriots in NFL
[4:53:10] Lokajin: EU has a proper level of degeneracy to get this content down while liquid sits there and whines about player health and having 10 hours of sleep for everyone.
[4:53:11] Tartxo: This was a total PR stunt from Blizzard planning the RWF for Christmas and it took away from actual game play for the sake of the game getting attention at the holidays, I don't think it was fair to any of the competing teams
[4:53:13] xhale2nhale: One team brings the excitement while the other brings I guess silence
[4:53:14] CloudPants8081: towChad
[4:53:16] jilech: liquid are pulling
[4:53:19] demonicyoshi: echo is 100% more discipline when it comes to a race
[4:53:19] Thoreya: yep
[4:53:20] rosina_scarlett: Naoh is agreeing
[4:53:21] Reckless_Monk: pretty much
[4:53:22] Yagr6: but that does not mean liquid could not have woke up and killed it though
[4:53:23] firewalltwitch: @scenario17 wrong max confirmed he didnt know :)
[4:53:29] surpriseparty20: And Echo went full degen couple of days ago with an 18hr playtime .
[4:53:29] xmedpakx: because cannot read and only respond with hate
[4:53:31] Davedaman26: maybe this is a reason to restructure the RWF all together
[4:53:31] neo_0098: @jeffnsteff2019 exactly
[4:53:36] Keyastaron_: TAKE THE KILL AWAY kAPPA
[4:53:37] LoremasterMarthan: They need to decide a better way to handle raiding around holidays
[4:53:39] Keyastaron_: Kappa
[4:53:41] eaglerydr: The quality of pulls is more important that the number of pulls. Echo has that locked in.
[4:53:41] bdobbi: Liquids mods banned me for agreeing with max
[4:53:43] kaos4666: Echo killed it?
[4:53:51] WeaponII: I think the "raid pause" is a good idea going forward rather then pressing through the holidays
[4:53:51] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:53:53] Puppette: even Max said Echo played better on Raz
[4:53:56] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: there was also the promise of pizza inc
[4:53:58] recohhhh: Well I think it s multiple things towelie. Echo's core team has been raiding together for yeeeeaaaaarrrsss they have a lot of familiarity with each other. These Echo raiders were winning world firsts before limit/complexity were even formed
[4:54:02] soysos91: Blizz doesn't care that much about RWF
[4:54:03] crawcook: So the assumption is that Liquid will get it today, because of these nerfs?
[4:54:09] PvtHudson093: raids shouldnt come out near christmas
[4:54:13] kappaday23: Kappa
[4:54:16] firewalltwitch: Echo the better guild, but its still ruined
[4:54:25] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: they rallied after they found out pizza was going to be ordered'
[4:54:26] lawles_walrus: i will say, listening to the liquid dialog right now, they are chill and in good spirits
[4:54:26] manmower: do the players in the discord suggest which parts of the fight to nerf?
[4:54:29] Tartxo: absolutely
[4:54:31] Lokajin: @crawcook yes cause liquid was progging the same phase echo was
[4:54:37] ryte1676: nerfs were announced at 7am pst?
[4:54:38] mozavich: @dash_07 check your sources? some of echo was ex-method.
[4:54:41] odtee: @kritkat1 towClap
[4:54:46] ZeusDNA: Yeah, they shouldn't nerf the stuff just because of holiday timing. Should always tune it based on difficulty.
[4:54:50] Provision_: But than it was a free kill for Liquid? Since patch day?
[4:54:52] clambynature: theres always lessoned learned
[4:55:03] manmower: still a good xpac
[4:55:04] Anderus00: well why did they release right before xmas they had to have known this was going to happen
[4:55:08] 0doz: @Towelliee  Why blizz didnt release the expa a week before.. ?? indie company
[4:55:15] firewalltwitch: @ryte1676 there was more nerfs, that max didnt know about, total bs
[4:55:24] Sluggs_: they nerfed the shields in p2 by 50% thats crazy
[4:55:25] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[4:55:25] honeybadger1113: if i was blizz i would have said fuck it eiher yall can break for holidays or keep going idc but nerfs arent comming till after the holidays
[4:55:26] resergz: what a shame that they did not wait until both guilds were online to nurf the boss.
[4:55:30] kappaday23: towCopium
[4:55:36] xhale2nhale: tbh they was stupid for releasing all three at once, shoul'dve waited on Mythic
[4:55:36] omidiart: @Towelliee was the fight just over tuned then?
[4:55:44] Tartxo: planning RWF around Christmas was just a horrible idea from the start
[4:55:47] Lokajin: Blizzards tuning department has no clue how to map out an encounter based on comp dps expectations like it makes zero sense where they gets these numbers from.
[4:55:48] Zyvuun: RWF guilds are essentially Blizzard Beta testers
[4:55:51] koldar_nemesis: why not release the raid just after the next reset after christmas?
[4:55:52] SilkeySmooth: the raid could have been pushed back until after the holidays
[4:55:52] WeaponII: Might be time to push Mythic to after holidays?
[4:55:54] neo_0098: I m losing more and more interest in the RWF
[4:56:08] manmower: there were no good options
[4:56:10] Affiiance: They don't have to... Make them gear up and work for it like EVERY OTHER RAIDER
[4:56:17] Provision_: @Lokajin it easier to overtune them and nerf than the other way around
[4:56:21] CrusaderNero: people would have CRIED if mythic was out after xmas. Especially those that doesnt do mythic KEKW
[4:56:23] ClassicMalcontent: Lesser evil. Delay the release of the Raid.
[4:56:25] TheGiant99: Blizz can stop the race for xmas then start it back after
[4:56:27] Affiiance: WE DONT GET NERFS FOR THE HOLIDAY
[4:56:28] jonertoner14: So happy for echo
[4:56:28] SamuraiWillZ916: made some AI art of you and posted it on your Discord
[4:56:29] Reckless_Monk: makes me less and less interested in RWF
[4:56:32] Reckless_Monk: thats bad
[4:56:32] 0doz: i insist, all this have a solutionj, release the expa 1 week before ,, GG
[4:56:34] Lokajin: @manmower the best option was just delay the nerfs 4 hours at best both guilds wer eprogging enrage.
[4:56:35] crawcook: I would just let them bang their heads against the wall, fuck it LUL
[4:56:36] Wrizzik: @Towelliee that's like people blaming NFL for the players playing on Christmas. That's dumb.
[4:56:38] Tartxo: I think it looks horrible on Blizzard
[4:56:39] xhale2nhale: @neo_0098 i've been lost interest, last time it was intersting for me was Nya'lotha
[4:56:43] instant_savage: coulda waited to they whee both pulling atleast
[4:56:46] resergz: they could have waited until after the new year to start the raid
[4:56:48] jonertoner14: Echo has best healers world
[4:56:48] HitmanGP: liquid pulling now
[4:56:51] CDubTheRIPper: is that 2 or 3 in a row for echo?
[4:56:54] NerdyTeK: papa johns
[4:56:54] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:56:56] Galadeon: Good option - Let both teams know 2-3 hours before.  Let Liquid be signed in and ready to go.
[4:57:02] Eviltuna13: not blizzards fault the guild spent 3-4 days doing split runs instead of hitting Mythic faster
[4:57:03] snuffles_80: thye had like 400% more viewers
[4:57:04] JokaThS: its their fault for the degen prefered to play instead of being with family ? lol
[4:57:05] happybooger: 3 wins
[4:57:06] lawles_walrus: I mean liquid didn't need to sleep Kappa
[4:57:08] WeaponII: @CDubTheRIPper 3
[4:57:14] Reckless_Monk: 1st pull theyre in intermission
[4:57:17] manmower: @lokajin but echo was still warmed up for the day and would have killed it first
[4:57:17] Moobot:  ADV.GG Sponsor - https://advanced.gg/products/towellie-starter-kit/?ref=Towelliee | CODE "TOWEL" AT CHECKOUT | https://advanced.gg/?ref=Towelliee
[4:57:23] TheGiant99: Dont get the big deal about playiong on xmas.....NFL, NBA and many oithers play on xmas
[4:57:23] Holysal: now will liquid drop them is the question
[4:57:25] Davedaman26: What if blizz had this planned from the start by having a game changing nerf at the last minute
[4:57:26] CDubTheRIPper: @WeaponII wow towPog
[4:57:28] Provision_: @instant_savage Liquid knew blizzard does these nerfs this early, they knew about 2 nerfs before. they gambled to sleep in until 10am
[4:57:29] Sluggs_: no way they one shot first pull of the day
[4:57:32] CloudPants8081: towChad
[4:57:40] dreamwalker213: @eviltuna13 they literally do that very RWF, that’s a terrible argument
[4:57:42] CrusaderNero: who cares
[4:57:44] Tartxo: exxxxactly
[4:57:55] WeaponII: how does it look if the first 4 teams kill it today?
[4:57:56] RandomizeMike: what if its this one lol
[4:57:57] Reckless_Monk: TRUUUUEE
[4:57:57] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: Admit it. Liquid pulled a Bill Buckner.
[4:58:10] Keyastaron_: nobody should be oin there w them bout the nerfs its stupid imo
[4:58:10] SilkeySmooth: if you know wake up and raid
[4:58:13] TheGiant99: So echo won what does it actually mean
[4:58:28] Alepouditsa: and the need to have the raids live at the same time
[4:58:35] Holysal: @TheGiant99 echo won but blizzard looks bad
[4:58:41] TheRealKingofmonkeys: nerfs should be announced very publicly and with plenty of advanced notice
[4:58:43] honeybadger1113: thats how it should be period tbh
[4:58:45] jeffnsteff2019: there should be private servers for those raid teams and nerfs are global and not discovered and alll teams compete same times
[4:58:49] WeaponII: @TheGiant99 enjoy holiday and time to get ready for next tier lol
[4:58:57] mozavich: insider raiding confirmed!
[4:59:01] twistedstick1: Nerfs shouldn't happen till both teams are actively playing.
[4:59:05] Rudric_Ice: chris Metzen will fix it Kappa
[4:59:14] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: @jeffnsteff2019 agree
[4:59:15] TheGiant99: it doesnt really mean anything in the long run'
[4:59:22] Eviltuna13: @dreamwalker213 in the other RWF races all 3 where not out at the same time. they had 1-2 weeks before Mythic cane out
[4:59:23] Thoreya: i will die of laughter if they get it first try lol
[4:59:23] Reckless_Monk: I want BDGG to be 3rd
[4:59:35] Alienfromger: aversion was 6/8
[4:59:35] Provision_: @twistedstick1 but 4 were racing for it. you can't adjust for all
[4:59:48] Sluggs_: it would have been a much more fun race if they nerfed it like 2 hours later
[4:59:50] firewalltwitch: i want BDGG to beat liqui,d would be funny
[4:59:56] WeaponII: agreed
[4:59:56] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:59:58] Thoreya: 100% agree
[5:00:00] edohran: Thats their fault
[5:00:00] SuperLost89: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on a staged nerf schedule? like blizzard releases a timeframe of nerfs to specific mechanics throughout the rwf
[5:00:01] dreamwalker213: @eviltuna13 I mean yeah, but regardless they have to do splits. You don’t just walk into mythic
[5:00:04] ScurvyHyam: Raiding from home remotely makes more sense
[5:00:04] WeaponII: this happened with jailer, too
[5:00:05] WainDOC: BDGG could be second lol
[5:00:08] lawles_walrus: yeah i don't understand why they don't already do that
[5:00:11] deadxarrival: you think they going to clear it first pull now?
[5:00:16] WeaponII: most flew home to kill the boss
[5:00:17] Puppette: Sloot said on twitter that he doesn't have power
[5:00:19] WQKPtheDON: BDGG is at home and bad weather is hurting them
[5:00:20] lawles_walrus: like i get timezones and stuff but everybody else makes it work
[5:00:27] firewalltwitch: im cheering for BDGG 2nd, the chaos!
[5:00:31] Vecter39: yea not starting raid until 10am is liquids issue
[5:00:37] Eviltuna13: @dreamwalker213 i agree
[5:00:38] jilech: Rogerbrown just said that, that last pull probably would have been sub 5% pre nerf, the last 4% would have been hard
[5:00:41] pavepawns: what was the nerf ?
[5:00:41] danimoto10: GM kill inc lol
[5:00:42] Reckless_Monk: L + Ratio Blizzard
[5:00:45] Lulaboo: Yeah theres power out for some raiders in BDGG
[5:00:47] Alienfromger: then i would say they woke up to late Kappa
[5:00:50] wah7767: blizz has buffed it for 10 pulls
[5:00:51] Dannyboy4477: if they kill it on the first kill  race to world first will be a joke
[5:00:54] surpriseparty20: If they kill it sub 10 pulls it will still look bad LUL
[5:00:55] nKoalaBear: we can call it a tie if they kill it on first pull LULW
[5:01:05] jeffnsteff2019: its just managment or how raid was handle
[5:01:08] Affiiance: Dragonflight is awesome... this is still some bullshit
[5:01:11] anord999: if they get this i will be up in arms
[5:01:12] WQKPtheDON: bomb cyclone coming through
[5:01:13] PenguinBreaker: real raiders would have generators
[5:01:16] Lokajin: feel for sloot hes hating this race lol
[5:01:16] happybooger: yep, Sloot cant get online
[5:01:32] jeffnsteff2019: i live in NWPA in midst of blizzard with power flickering
[5:01:34] firewalltwitch: liquid gonna choke
[5:01:35] captain_khyzan: nah whats gonna look bad is if they dont kill it in a few pulls....
[5:01:46] Reckless_Monk: Second Wind?
[5:01:47] Roth___: BDGG is east coast right? we got his super hard with wind last night, tree almost took out my house.
[5:01:47] Lokajin: impending victory

[5:02:03] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: i'm sure it's hard to 100% focus rn
[5:02:11] WainDOC: BDGG is gonna be second trust me lol
[5:02:19] clambynature: #tinfoilhat
[5:02:22] NinjaGlovz: monkaS monkaS monkaS
[5:02:26] NetherRegion: Good
[5:02:29] Lloydbanksz: MAX is a warlock?
[5:02:30] Lokajin: @Holysal because limit had a history of heavy RMT
[5:02:33] jeffnsteff2019: true
[5:02:34] edohran: I would love it to be that
[5:02:41] jeffnsteff2019: that's a good theroy
[5:02:44] CrunkyBrewster: CAT FIGHT!!!
[5:02:44] Rudric_Ice: HELL YEA GIGACHAD BLIZZARD

[5:02:47] instant_savage: holy shit joey styles throiwback
[5:02:49] edohran: Max doesnt play... he couches
[5:02:49] mavericks312: blizzard is gonna have comments turnedo ff on streams and videos for awhile
[5:02:49] ryte1676: blizzard has always said that the RWF is a community event and they don't officially particpate? right?
[5:02:50] Roth___: OH MY GYAD
[5:02:51] RandomizeMike: I mean the nerf only effects 2 groups atm lol
[5:02:53] crunchyFrog999: DEEPS
[5:03:18] captain_khyzan: @Holysal personally? they are to monetized and just abuse the hell out of fans / viewers for loot. and they spend metric tons on advantages imo... yet they still come out behind everytime
[5:03:18] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections

[5:03:36] WeaponII: there's no shot they take this first pull

[5:04:08] Daarksyde: Towelliee fans were here!
[5:04:08] Reckless_Monk: Echo came in at 41% on WF kill
[5:04:10] TialePetit: @pavepawns They slowed the static circle ALOT!
[5:04:12] Sluggs_: 2 resses everyone alive should be a kill
[5:04:19] yshtola1337: the wfr is over echo won
[5:04:20] Zyvuun: You are
[5:04:24] citrinesoan: i look good chalie boy, lookalike....
[5:04:30] Lokajin: casters all flew home
[5:04:31] CrunkyBrewster: Uhoh
[5:04:35] firewalltwitch: @SilkeySmooth boss shoudlve been nerfed last night well echo was a sleep too then Kappa
[5:04:35] CrunkyBrewster: its falling apart
[5:04:36] Roth___: @SilkeySmooth Yeah imagine sleeping so your mental health is good unlike last year.
[5:04:38] Lokajin: they confirmed yesterday that all of them were flying today
[5:04:40] Larc9783: Cut me mick, I can't see
[5:04:40] Drogdorf: FeelsAmazingMan nymnCorn
[5:04:43] Rudric_Ice: liquid casters dont care KEKW
[5:04:47] Nokterian: Naguura went home yesterday
[5:04:58] Hexxdecc: let's do side by side again
[5:05:07] manmower: if they warm up they can pull out more dps
[5:05:09] dreamwalker213: This is also first pull after waking up not even first pull after raiding for hours already and being in the groove
[5:05:16] ottavianni: dont have deeps
[5:05:20] SilkeySmooth: @Roth54 imagine knows the herf is gaoing to happen and you chose to sleep in and not do your job and raid
[5:05:21] Reckless_Monk: yes
[5:05:21] RoboMaximillion: this storm though lol
[5:05:23] remixonfire91: looking iffy on the dps check tho
[5:05:25] surpriseparty20: yes
[5:05:28] Sluggs_: that storm is so slow
[5:05:28] Wrizzik: LUL this is hilarious
[5:05:30] RoboMaximillion: its so slow
[5:05:38] Lokajin: execute phase
[5:05:43] myfans4141: guys, iI laugh at everything but this is too .much
[5:05:45] Drogdorf: Echo was way ahead at this point
[5:05:47] danimoto10: there dps is pretty shit
[5:05:47] WeaponII: but this has been their problem the whole time: DPS
[5:05:57] emznev: just press your buttona

[5:06:07] Saucy722: Thy still got it
[5:06:07] Daarksyde: they could be just seeing this nerf and winging it
[5:06:08] Roth___: @SilkeySmooth Dude, Max said they didnt know because they were sleeping, the information went out but didnt reach them because they were asleep. Get real information before being toxic.
[5:06:12] Daarksyde: they will get it next time
[5:06:14] Reckless_Monk: theyre 2% behind
[5:06:18] WQKPtheDON: we were here a second time!!!!!!!!!!!
[5:06:18] edohran: watch Blizzard revert the nerf

[5:06:22] Calphurnious: Did echo get it pre nerf or post nerf
[5:06:24] NinjaGlovz: monkaS
[5:06:25] surpriseparty20: oh it's very possible
[5:06:33] 3dRes: Towelliee the Prophet
[5:06:35] snuffles_80: nooo ads
[5:06:40] Eviltuna13: crreamAD crreamAD
[5:06:40] SilkeySmooth: @Roth54 nope they knew
[5:06:41] Niksen_99: OMEGALUL
[5:06:42] dreamwalker213: Pull not even remotely near clean and it’s that close to a kill
[5:06:42] REALPolarbeezy: Towlliee for commentary next tier
[5:06:45] firewalltwitch: @Calphurnious post
[5:06:45] Hexxdecc: nopie
[5:06:48] Metket: LUL
[5:06:49] gritbarontv: ouch
[5:06:50] NinjaGlovz: pikaOMG
[5:06:52] Drogdorf: not enough DPS
[5:06:54] myfans4141: im learning to speak as well
[5:06:54] danimoto10: rip
[5:06:54] Lloydbanksz: towelllie the caster
[5:06:57] Nokterian: Prophet towelliee Santa
[5:06:59] Daarksyde: they pushed this attempt to see nerf. now they have next pull
[5:07:00] Holysal: they can get it
[5:07:00] WeaponII: DPS just isn't there
[5:07:01] Mikey__D: nerf or not--echo is goat
[5:07:03] WainDOC: still incompetent
[5:07:04] crunchyFrog999: well .. it ain't that easy lol
[5:07:06] ZeusDNA: It's also their first pull of the whole day. They aren't hours into their day
[5:07:08] citrinesoan: san antonio on the map .
[5:07:12] kennn_y: First pull of the day though
[5:07:19] ryte1676: liquid doesn't have the dps Echo does
[5:07:19] Nokterian: the dps is way behind of Echo
[5:07:23] Lokajin: this is also liquid's first pull of the day instead of potentially an hour in if blizzard just waited
[5:07:24] hangloosebro: Zaelia outpumping theire disc big time
[5:07:25] captain_khyzan: liquid flop ; ; lol
[5:07:26] Tartxo: they're also going into this with morale down too :(
[5:07:30] Masqerader: the dps is there, they just had someone mess up their fulmination  in last pull
[5:07:35] firewalltwitch: first pull of the day is different though, plus its already over
[5:07:38] WQKPtheDON: true their motivation isn't as high either
[5:07:41] camarac: getting that far after the demoralizing news on their first attempt of the day is still telling
[5:07:45] thanjax: I don't know that I seen any ret pally in mythic raid
[5:07:45] grimreapermn: also doing it non stop would wear down mental
[5:07:50] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: professional or not, i wouldnt be surprised if they are a little discouraged
[5:07:54] Ultratide_: id be shattered
[5:08:00] TheGiant99: Blizz choose who they wanted to win
[5:08:01] mathas1204: im cold
[5:08:06] jmalmin: That boss looks really fun to be up against on mythic for sure.
[5:08:06] dreamwalker213: Not a clean pull, low motivation, and also first pull after waking up. And still almost killed it. Wild
[5:08:06] pereadin: driney always looks defeated though lol
[5:08:07] anord999: you are right Liquid is behind on dps from Echo but they should bet W2 today
[5:08:07] TialePetit: It would have been a different story if Liquid had first shotted it today. But this shows that they still have details to work out @Towelliee
[5:08:10] xhale2nhale: yea their morale is down I wouldnt be surprise they end the stream after the kill
[5:08:10] CloudPants8081: towOof
[5:08:18] Thicc_Fil_A: id be big mad
[5:08:18] manmower: that would put me on my A game for sure
[5:08:20] xhold0utx: xhold0utx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 14 month streak! 
[5:08:20] Holysal: @TheGiant99 nah echo is better
[5:08:23] WeaponII: Max said the guys hate the feeling of waking up to a loss.
[5:08:28] ninukai: NA never has a chance in these races
[5:08:42] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: to that point, don't they have a support team. someone should have been on top of that nerf and woken them up
[5:08:55] firewalltwitch: Echo is clearly the better guild, but liquid woulda killed it last night with these massive nerfs
[5:08:57] Holysal: @ninukai thats not true
[5:08:58] winraider: BDDG can t play due to blizzard storm...did u know?
[5:08:58] TialePetit: @TheGiant99 @TheGiant99 Naa.. could say that until that pull from Liquid.. but it just showed that they are not quite there
[5:09:01] Sweet_Lou__: Bills lost 4 Super Bowls in a row so I don't feel bad for anyone tbh LMAO
[5:09:01] PigPenLen: when they started off it reminded me of Clark Grizwold losing his mind with psychotic happiness on Christmas Eve
[5:09:02] Ultratide_: I like both squads so I always win in the race lol
[5:09:04] myfans4141: towellie how r ya
[5:09:11] anord999: that race they won was what Castle Nathria?
[5:09:14] ScurvyHyam: Sire was amazing
[5:09:17] firewalltwitch: BDGG for 2nd Kappa !
[5:09:18] ScurvyHyam: It was pull for pull

[5:09:24] xhaven: Still I feel Liquid has to work on thier morale, Jailer kill felt like same thing happened. Its not easy to lose for 1st place but gotta pull the group up for 2nd and show you can recover.
[5:09:26] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee the RWF should be america first and eu first due to different time zones
[5:09:29] crawcook: I was so confused, I thought the drama was that Echo didn't get it and now Liquid will get it cause of nerfs :D
[5:09:33] Archiduss: Liquid doesn't have a great track record in Wow RWF so far. With a big defeat last tier, and now again a solid defeat again by a better performing Echo. Maybe time for some leadersip changes? Or is that not a thing with WoW guilds. Like other sporting clubs.
[5:09:35] manmower: what do you guys want? mandatory raiding hours and the server shuts down outside that?
[5:09:39] deadxarrival: lets see how bad lfr is lol
[5:09:50] WeaponII: 0-2
[5:09:55] ScurvyHyam: Sylvannas?
[5:09:56] Archiduss: Jailer
[5:09:57] balancedlight: did you see liquid almost just 1 shot it. @Towelliee
[5:09:59] crawcook: Jailer
[5:10:00] skoll135: 0-2 with liquid
[5:10:04] lumaday: jailer
[5:10:04] WeaponII: As Liquid
[5:10:17] captain_khyzan: @SilkeySmooth lol but EU still finished before NA ><
[5:10:20] winraider: BDGG can t play due to blizzard storm...did u know that guys?
[5:10:35] crawcook: As a group they are 0-3, just different sponsor

[5:16:06] Holysal: @Affiiance he just hates max
[5:16:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: The EU vs. NA people are always talking trash, they do it in AWC and PvP stuff, too
[5:16:14] Slipperysud: What addon do you use to put all your addon buttons in one menu?
[5:16:21] jeffnsteff2019: i think santa hat was a trolling hotfix to boss taunt raiders

[5:16:52] GopnikRP: Hey towelliee, I just got back into wow and love playing prot pally. Is it viable for M+ and Raids though? I haven't gotten that far yet. Thanks King
[5:17:00] xhale2nhale: Max said long time ago it's just randoms jumping in when RWF start to have the EU vs NA arguement then they vanish until the next race

[5:17:01] WeaponII: Like people act as these guilds don't factor in start and maintenance times to the progression
[5:17:15] jeffnsteff2019: you done and mess up now a aron
[5:17:17] Affiiance: He literally sits around and angry tweets about Liquid
[5:17:17] Holysal: he hates max is all
[5:17:24] eaglerydr: You are right. It is not the players fault at all. It is Blizzard not understanding a RWF should be run.
[5:17:25] BlueDuckFunk: @Slipperysud one is called MBB Reborn
[5:17:25] abracka_: people just trying to start shit lol. naowh's tweet is completely the same as the one you made
[5:17:28] Zettabyte: "Why you haf to be mad? It's only a game" Kappa
[5:17:48] xeeeoN: there will never be a good time to nerf things without a global release or when they play in the same time zone
[5:18:24] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: next raid: Full contact RWF
[5:18:40] Syrc0: What is that minimap button addon?
[5:18:42] pereadin: Maybe liquid should go back to not competing in RWF? When they were limit pre RWF mindset they were still getting 2nd/3rd place.
[5:18:46] mavericks312: nah scripes shady ass dont care
[5:18:56] manmower: i feel bad for 3rd place, if they timed this right they could have won as well
[5:19:08] Niksen_99: So mad LUL @mavericks312
[5:19:21] jeffnsteff2019: raid first should be country first stead world first then take USA first vs country first and make it a charity first

[5:19:45] Eviltuna13: When money and sponsors are on the line its win or loose
[5:19:46] firewalltwitch: just log on at the right time and u get WF
[5:19:47] Holysal: @pereadin then its just echo winning and no one being close
[5:19:55] SuperZuer: would't be the first time blizzard butt fuck someone
[5:20:03] kenagon55: pepeD
[5:20:06] snuffles_80: no cloak on a slutmog :)
[5:20:06] coldarmorTBG: This was the first raid I ever did.. even though I started in tbc lol..
[5:20:07] Nokterian: I fucking love transmog runs
[5:20:20] coldarmorTBG: End of tbc*
[5:20:21] ClassicMalcontent: I think its great. Love it Blizz. More of this. Time nerfs to rotate winners for extra salt. Make it massive nerf timed perfectly. Kappa
[5:20:28] Provision_: @Holysal Echo and Liquid were nearly same level before today pull...
[5:20:29] monute316: cant keep losing and dealing out money and not win sad but true its a business
[5:20:42] Thoreya: lmaoo
[5:20:43] Nefand: ofc they killed it right after nerfs
[5:20:45] WeaponII: hundred thousand thieves lmao

[5:20:50] skylaars: 100,000 thieves lol
[5:20:58] Sneekzx: @Towelliee I'm on the fence when it comes to buying - do I need to commit to a guild with raid times to enjoy this xpac?
[5:21:01] snuffles_80: I feel so sad about Preach
[5:21:03] firewalltwitch: echo had way better casters
[5:21:07] Lulaboo: Thats what im afraid of for Liquid. They are the only ones with an ORG that have more than just a wow guild. Team liquid is a business that may be looking at shit different
[5:21:15] jeffnsteff2019: yeah preach will use his money rebuild his flooded studio
[5:21:16] dreamwalker213: @monute316 to be fair happens to sports teams in every sport every year
[5:21:18] Holysal: @Provision_ yep but if liquid stop rwf then I would lose interest since one could challenge echo
[5:21:22] OldManMitch: I mean Naohw was home and the last time liquid won they were home. Something to be said for raiding at home
[5:21:31] stabzmcgeee: genuine question,, how much longer should blizz wait to do the nerf,, it was 10am,
[5:21:34] myfans4141: somehow thats bad
[5:21:37] firewalltwitch: @sneekzx very casual expansion, even pvp solo q, heroic raids are a joke
[5:22:03] vimie: weird how these dudes min-max like crazy but will take a break when Blizz is known to be working on patches
[5:22:13] Vecter39: or liquid plan better
[5:22:15] monute316: true thats why  i  think clock may be ticking or has stoped
[5:22:29] WeaponII: @Lulaboo 100%
[5:22:41] ScurvyHyam: About another hour
[5:22:45] Holysal: or Blizzard do better interal testing KEKW
[5:22:47] Zodiec: na a mod in liquid twitch chat said that it was announced at 7am pst in a discord
[5:22:49] Leelo4673: Hello
[5:22:52] stabzmcgeee: i take back my question,,, blizz should tune better so these nerfs arent a facter
[5:22:53] invisible_one: what nurf happened?
[5:22:56] Sneekzx: @firewalltwitch so very easily pugable & easy to get gear on M+ without doing insanely high keys?
[5:22:56] Lokajin: Liquid honestly should of been on the east coast not west coast raiding
[5:23:00] firewalltwitch: @vecter39 or blizzard nerfs the boss last night when there awake and echo is asleep LUL
[5:23:10] Leelo4673: Got lucky this morning with a drop from a rare in storms
[5:23:26] firewalltwitch: @sneekzx M+ is bad atm, u can pug raids like normals
[5:23:42] anord999: @Lokajin i agree with this
[5:23:42] dreamwalker213: @sneekzx I would say keys are not easily puggable right now
[5:23:42] Holysal: @Lokajin thats where liquids place is though
[5:23:43] firewalltwitch: lwo M+ kets liek a 2 are easy though
[5:23:55] Sauronix: I want a caster alt what should i pick? any suggestions? :)
[5:23:57] Sneekzx: @firewalltwitch Can you get decent ilvl without doing M+ tho?
[5:23:58] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[5:24:03] Rudric_Ice: 500k and u get it
[5:24:04] olbearic: liquid actually dropped the ball.    Can we talk about the fact that leadership did not tell everyone to bedge the moment they caught up in percent yesterday to ensure they are awake with echo and extend possible time to catch the shadow hotfix or whatever.  I know its hindsight but seems like a silly mistake.
[5:24:11] Leelo4673: Design for elemental lariat
[5:24:11] Sneekzx: @firewalltwitch Since you need min ivll to raid
[5:24:11] PvtHudson093: boomkek
[5:24:19] firewalltwitch: @sneekzx yes world quests
[5:24:26] Lokajin: @Lokajin ya but there putting themselves on a shitty schedule compared to there competition
[5:24:27] Provision_: @Holysal well Echo woke up 5am to start raiding so yeah
[5:24:38] snuffles_80: why do I see so many downvote emotes?
[5:24:42] dutchie76: world firsts i am never watching again
[5:24:47] Zodiec: @Lokajin echo had to do that too ...
[5:24:55] dutchie76: i knew echo would win
[5:24:58] Holysal: Liquid doesnt have the fire like they once had imo
[5:25:04] olbearic: @Towelliee I agree on that too tho
[5:25:18] Kinghorn: Holysal Stare
[5:25:20] Provision_: They were also betting that Echo would not kill it before they wake up.
[5:25:26] Leelo4673: How much is the design for elemental lariat worth? Been told it’s rare
[5:25:47] mavericks312: i hope this lights liquids ass on fire for the next race thoug
[5:25:49] dutchie76: lol
[5:25:54] Holysal: @Provision_ both start raid at the reset for their server
[5:25:58] dreamwalker213: @leelo4673 couple mil on most servers
[5:26:04] happybooger: @leelo4673 i just saw it on the AH for 2.5 mil
[5:26:05] dutchie76: next time don't release a raid near xmas imo
[5:26:07] jeffnsteff2019: if there is a critcal bug they should shutdown raid server input hotfix allow all guilds continue on prog
[5:26:10] Raafuh: I would assume all the teams racing otherwise it wouldn’t make sense right?
[5:26:16] Provision_: @Holysal yet they decided to wake up 5 hours after Echo?
[5:26:20] myfans4141: oooh sniffa
[5:26:21] LeXieSterling: I think it is time for  Dateline investigation.
[5:26:23] stabzmcgeee: there shouldnt be any secret discords at all between devs and players,,, we all pay they same game time, who dictates who times is worth more
[5:26:29] Leelo4673: Eu server
[5:26:43] mavericks312: the echo astros
[5:26:45] Saucy722: I made 8M from@making lariats and cloaks
[5:26:46] Sarcastard: we had a guildie swap servers to buy one off auction for 20K
[5:26:49] im_capy: Hammer Guild created to who ever gives it to him Kappa
[5:26:49] dreamwalker213: @provision_ you understand how time zones work right?
[5:26:51] akia03: hehe 4 chinese guilds in top 10 again
[5:26:57] Rudric_Ice: TheIlluminati its a conspiracy TheIlluminati
[5:26:58] vimie: idk how you would check/enforce all that. Simpler to just officially tweet out 30 mins ahead of a hotfix

[5:27:03] jeffnsteff2019: the blizzard bill bilicheck
[5:27:17] olbearic: @Towelliee that sounds like someone at blizz failed the integrity check
[5:27:20] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 timezones when Echo pull 18 hours raiding? There no timezone anymore at that point LUL
[5:27:20] LeXieSterling: Nerf Gate. The inside story who will be go under the Hammer. lol
[5:27:28] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: @Towlliee, would you appear on 60 minutes if they wanted to interview you?

[5:27:29] Zodiec: so the big question is when did anyone at liquid know about the announcement right? we will never know
[5:27:33] Hoodie187: most definitely
[5:27:40] Leelo4673: Couple mil?? That rare? Looked on my server and there is none on ah. Read forums and some servers say people pay gold cap. Someone sold for 7.5mil but then someone bought for 67 gold lol
[5:27:40] Shrenko: towTinfoil
[5:27:41] Kizmet_TV: CINA NUMBER ONE
[5:27:43] Wrizzik: they 100% zerg
[5:27:47] im_capy: Winnie the pooh would force them to win
[5:27:48] Lilurrn: its just a slap in the face bc im pretty sure liquid was under the impression the boss was going to stay unchanged given blizzard staff went on holiday yesterday and yet on their "off" day a surprise nerf comes in caught everyone off guard
[5:27:49] Lokajin: China's a special level of degeneracy
[5:27:50] Yagr6: imagine the refs just taking the ball from tom brady in the 4th being down and with 2 mins left on the clock, i feel thats what i just watched
[5:27:55] boajxc: they on that good shit
[5:27:57] LeXieSterling: No Soup for them no sleep for them
[5:27:57] Shrenko: SMOrc mode
[5:28:01] vimie: LUL
[5:28:02] dutchie76: what a surprise, echo was struggling this morning in phase 2,3 a little and then bam a nerf to know ones surprise lol
[5:28:04] Provision_: Yeah echo did 18 hour pulls, where Liquid kept to their schedule
[5:28:09] Holysal: @Lokajin yeah bc they account share KEKW
[5:28:10] CloudPants8081: how did china not win
[5:28:18] Rudric_Ice: how da Chinese playing WoW tho ?
[5:28:18] Jarless: they dont sleep LUL LUL LUL
[5:28:19] eldritchkell: I heard they are actually cyborgs from an alternate universe!! :P
[5:28:32] jeffnsteff2019: #nerfgate2022 #shennigans
[5:28:33] Provision_: He prob was told, but he was sleeping
[5:28:41] olbearic: @Yagr6  no you saw tom brady party till 6 am that day and then sleep during the game and not even play lmao
[5:28:42] bloodogg35: he didnt they announced it 3 hours ago
[5:28:46] WainDOC: so global releas matters?
[5:28:46] Lokajin: @Lokajin its not even the account sharing its all the rampant botting, the insane use of drugs to play longer in games. Like china's gaming scene is something crazy lol
[5:28:53] dreamwalker213: @provision_ that had nothing to do with your comment I was responding to. Liquid and echo will never wake up at the same times
[5:28:54] clambynature: i think so because of the show of rtwf
[5:28:57] LeXieSterling: There a show for Luluaboo
[5:29:00] Leelo4673: Ads
[5:29:03] citrinesoan: teamliquidEZ HeyGuys teamliquidEZ
[5:29:04] LuciWho: He said at the start of his stream today
[5:29:04] bloodogg35: he was just talking about that
[5:29:09] Yagr6: @Javants sure kid
[5:29:10] LeXieSterling: She should schedule some interviews.
[5:29:34] xhale2nhale: I admire them for keeping the morale high by joking on the pulls

[5:29:47] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 why not? Liquid could shift so they would. But they decided to keep their schedule. Liquid could had done a short night like Echo and push for it
[5:29:52] FRMTHEDENx: they didnt know
[5:29:56] kennn_y: Said tehy were told on discord but they were asleep
[5:29:56] bloodogg35: ]they didnt
[5:29:59] Leelo4673: Is there a site you can go to that tells you how much stuff is? I know there was a discord server for eso where you can put stuff in and it says what to sell for

[5:30:01] WainDOC: ofc max knew he was just too tired
[5:30:07] Lilurrn: I didnt hear max say anything at start of stream as soon as it went up they went right into pulls
[5:30:07] layali1698: Ya you can tell that fire to finish is gone but they’re joking and having a good time at least
[5:30:08] Alsparq: he said they had no idea
[5:30:18] Zodiec: getting up this late when you know its most likely the last day is still a mistake
[5:30:23] Metket: @Provision_ 100 pulls ahead, 1 day ahead still so far behind
[5:30:25] xhale2nhale: I think he said they found out about it 2hrs after waking but I might be wrong
[5:30:25] LuciWho: They was told 2hrs before in a discord but was asleep, the gotfix was implemented 1.5hrs later
[5:30:26] dutchie76: i knew this would happen
[5:30:33] jeffnsteff2019: there should be interviews with devs and raiders on stream answer hard questions  and probs
[5:30:42] Lokajin: @Lilurrn you werent listening then he had a good 10 minute monologue when his prestream screen was up.
[5:30:43] dutchie76: lol
[5:30:44] Teriyakibro: KEKW
[5:30:45] Calphurnious: eu hotfix only XD
[5:30:47] stabzmcgeee: preach said they found out about the nerf as they were pulling the boss on the kill
[5:30:50] abracka_: lula  farted
[5:30:53] CloudPants8081: towChad
[5:30:54] Doog45: doesn't matter now, they wiped already today
[5:30:55] spookychefkarolina: LUL
[5:31:04] im_capy: send towOny to go investigate downstairs
[5:31:06] jacnut: milkman is there
[5:31:06] xhale2nhale: basically they was still getting the crust out their eyes when they got ready
[5:31:07] recohhhh: I actually agree with you that playing from home might actually be the best way for liquid
[5:31:11] Malarick: Someone's gifts are getting wrapped
[5:31:12] bloodogg35: right
[5:31:13] Raafuh: She’s pulling out the gifts from the Towelliee bag.
[5:31:18] sadistic300: towTinfoil
[5:31:23] Mallaes: 👀
[5:31:24] PvtHudson093: when the nerf hit Echo were already mid pull
[5:31:25] dwolters_the_zombieman: this will be the biggest scam in rwf history
[5:31:29] myfans4141: big brother is not pleased
[5:31:46] dutchie76: i love the wowhead comments atm
[5:31:48] dutchie76: lol
[5:31:53] vimie: discord the new meta for RWF
[5:31:56] Ginentonic: thats when preach found out
[5:31:59] dutchie76: @dwolters_the_zombieman SeemsGood
[5:32:01] CloudPants8081: atpMurray
[5:32:07] xhale2nhale: yea the WOWhead comments are life comedy
[5:32:10] dutchie76: yes
[5:32:14] dutchie76: sounds like it
[5:32:18] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: bogaMath bogaMath
[5:32:30] iDeez88: imagine losing because sleep and missed hotfix
[5:32:32] iDeez88: rough
[5:32:34] stabzmcgeee: oh unless preach ment thats when the casters found out,,
[5:32:35] Alienfromger: inside informations towTinfoil
[5:32:37] Ariochs: Scripe said he was informed of the nerf
[5:32:39] Dcarter: Right when you feel blizz may get it right they do this and screw it up
[5:32:54] Lilurrn: Liquid was sleeping after a day of grinding
[5:32:56] FRMTHEDENx: yea why not just release the nerf mid day instead of favor one side
[5:32:56] Lilurrn: what a joke
[5:32:58] dutchie76: i agree @Dcarter
[5:32:59] im_capy: Echo was already doing the pulls cleaner, even if they didnt know about the nerf, chances are they still wouldve killed it still imo
[5:33:02] dreamwalker213: @provision_ there is literally like a 5 hour time difference between EU and PST. They would have to wake up in the middle of the night to wake up at the same time

[5:33:05] CloudPants8081: atpCarl
[5:33:07] Doog45: don't forget the part liquid wiped on their pull post nerf though
[5:33:07] SaltywankeR: preach was talking about it 3-4 pulls before the kill, n hes sitting there in his team echo tshirt with panel of buddies
[5:33:09] mavericks312: scripes out here paying for a nerf
[5:33:09] omidiart: @Towelliee isn't that like cheating?
[5:33:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: all according to the plan
[5:33:14] Lilurrn: like these players are human
[5:33:14] freetrial_on_kick: they were tied at best pull with echo 120 pulls behind liquid last night it was due time for echo
[5:33:14] g0n_z3n: Sloppy on Blizz's part
[5:33:16] Lokajin: @Dcarter story of this expansion so far with everything revolving around balance outside of class balance lol.
[5:33:17] resergz: Blizzard gave Echo the win, no question in my mind.
[5:33:19] Dcarter: Blizz screwed this one up at the 1 yard line
[5:33:21] Malnar1123: Blizzard need to decide whether they care about RTWF or not. They can't just dip a toe in it
[5:33:21] Provision_: @Lilurrn Echo did not grind? LUL
[5:33:25] iDeez88: RWF should be "time in raid dungeon total"
[5:33:28] Samiccus: @Towelliee it was the RACE TO WORLD NERF!
[5:33:32] Holysal: this is just a bad look for Blizzard
[5:33:33] Alienfromger: sleeping while bossnerf makes no sense
[5:33:38] DeanoTV: NA stay PJSalt
[5:33:38] mavericks312: blizz pulled a russ and threw it at the 1 yrd line
[5:33:38] ClassicMalcontent: Both can be true statements at the same time.
[5:33:39] Lokajin: @Dcarter they threw when they should of ran the ball.
[5:33:52] arturiuss44: like winning the coin toss in OT in football and scoring without other team getting a chance controversy before change.
[5:34:04] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 it a RACE... they had 5 hours head start and had 2 nerfs during their pulls too. They decided to stay to schedule knowing blizzard want to close this before chrismas
[5:34:04] Ginentonic: echo was going to win regardless
[5:34:06] dutchie76: race to the world nerf lol
[5:34:09] xhale2nhale: lol Is aw someone on WoWhead comment say it was "race to World Nerf"
[5:34:11] Lilurrn: How many useless attempts did liquid put into before this boss was "adjusted" 3 times
[5:34:13] Ginentonic: but blizz still f'd up
[5:34:16] Holysal: @DeanoTV not salty at all. just ruins the hype
[5:34:21] brewgamingtv: @Dcarter just like seahawks not running the ball lol
[5:34:25] CloudPants8081: rigged atpWind
[5:34:31] olbearic: @resergz no liquid lost it on their own lmao.  why do 50+ senseless pulls after catching up in percent yesterday and not sleep to wake up when echo does.  instead lets stay up till 4 am.
[5:34:35] Samiccus: lol they were like. Well its holiday vacation time press the button and lets finish this
[5:34:44] Provision_: They prob expected Liquid to wake up?
[5:34:47] resergz: maybe, but optics would have been much better for Blizzard.
[5:34:48] Holysal: @DeanoTV now it will be about the nerf timing instead of the great play by Echo
[5:34:48] Bl4ckSauce: why not KEKW
[5:34:52] turulmusic: There is no right time for nerfs
[5:34:52] gritbarontv: cause, Echo was the better team, lol
[5:34:53] CloudPants8081: Christmas atpRtsd
[5:34:54] DeadlyDoode: as a european who supports echo, if thats realy true ..its just unfair fron bliz..
[5:34:56] LuciWho: Im trying to get a clip of maxs comment for the investigation but it wont let me.... Timestamp 28.28 for anyone who wants to hear what he said
[5:35:00] Roth___: This entire convo wouldn't be happening if they just waited an hour or so to do the nerf. Simple as that.
[5:35:00] ZarathulPl0x: wouldn't the timing of the nerf be pretty close to just after blizzard got into the office?
[5:35:02] Djfarmville: So blizzard employees could celebrate christmas
[5:35:08] PvtHudson093: Someonw was like fuck i want to go home fo christmas
[5:35:15] im_capy: be funny if another guild gets 2nd now
[5:35:17] Zodiec: @Javants echo did this exact thing btw. got their bext pull and went to bad immediately
[5:35:20] xhale2nhale: oh yea Ion probably already got his speech wrote up
[5:35:22] lawles_walrus: maybe blizzard didn't think ECHO would kill it that quickly and that liquid would get notified and get up sooner?
[5:35:26] dutchie76: imagine if this nerf was at 6pm pst
[5:35:27] Shrenko: and Ion will dodge it !!
[5:35:31] turulmusic: There is no right time for nerfs, if they do when echo sleep then got the same questions
[5:35:35] dimofodi: It shouldn't matter when they sent it out. They sent multiple out while Echo was sleeping. The communication of it is a different story. If Liquid didn't have people up and in that discord by 11am PST that's their own damn fault.
[5:35:36] CloudPants8081: atpMurray ez answer there
[5:35:39] jo3ynickma: I feel like this is like the sneaker reseller scolding his plug, when dude could've just slept in line (stay online) like everyone else
[5:35:42] Lokajin: @DeanoTV of course cause it takes away from what could of been an awesome finish between both teams pulling together and a proper show off of may the best team win. The best team won regardless but it takes away from the spectacle of the race.
[5:35:43] Alienfromger: nobody will remember that shit after holidays... that was the plan towTinfoil
[5:35:45] tocu: my guess their answer will simply be it was the best we could offer to ensure our devs had a good vacation
[5:35:46] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[5:35:46] Samiccus: Blizzard HQ: pepeD Holiday party time launch the nerf!
[5:35:47] Doog45: I would agree the nerf sucks, but liquid is still wiping today post nerf
[5:35:50] Holysal: @dutchie76 it would be the same yeah
[5:35:54] Lilurrn: There is def a time window where both guilds are pulling to implement this nerf to say ok nerf is in and fastest to kill after would have been a well played
[5:35:58] Ultratide_: blizzard gonna leak the discord logs KEKW
[5:36:02] jo3ynickma: You not compromising schleep, you compromising the kill. You give n take obv. :p

[5:36:08] WeaponII: LOL
[5:36:12] CloudPants8081: atpCap
[5:36:17] lawles_walrus: maybe blizzard didn't think ECHO would kill it that quickly and that liquid would get notified and get up sooner?
[5:36:19] dreamwalker213: @provision_ so you just admitted that liquid should’ve changed their schedule to cater to to blizzards fuck up
[5:36:25] im_capy: meanwhile BDGG is going through irl shit
[5:36:30] stabzmcgeee: echo played out they damn minds,, 10% with 4 brezs up,, insane
[5:36:35] rillo5: Night terrors mam
[5:36:39] firewalltwitch: they nerfs were massive though, they messed up
[5:36:39] vimie: nerfs shoulcnt  be some secret. Tweet about it ahead of time
[5:36:40] Kinghorn: love how they buffed the boss like 3 times before anyone even saw them, then had to nerf them 4 times
[5:36:40] olbearic: @Zodiec it was a smart move.  if there is no new phase to "practice" go to bed and extend the race to hopefully catch this shadow hotfix with your competition.
[5:36:42] rosina_scarlett: Blizzard also did way to big of a nerf
[5:36:44] Lokajin: BDGG realistically wasnt in this race
[5:36:46] recohhhh: Not sure what changes liquid needs to do to improve enough to beat Echo. Any thoughts on changes they could make?
[5:36:50] Lokajin: they were always fighting for 3rd nothing more
[5:36:51] Shrenko: Blizzard = whooops 😳
[5:36:52] Zodiec: it was an insane pull by echo. not sure how blizz would have predicted that. timing still poor
[5:36:52] Ultratide_: he got elond
[5:36:56] MIKEBRASKA: @Towelliee Max's statement pre raid about the nerfs starts at 28:40 into his VOD. I can't clip it
[5:36:57] 1llum1n471: It's not about the result, it's about the perception with a company already suffering PR issues.
[5:36:57] WeaponII: People just doubting that Echo's damage was there, even before the nerf.
[5:37:02] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: turned that knob to 11
[5:37:04] tocu: In Fair ness that was the greatest pull of this tier period  techo turned on god like mode
[5:37:06] xendros78: you done fucked up a a ron
[5:37:08] Steelen: Echo knew their grandma's cooking is awaiting, hurry the fuck up and get r dun😂😂😂😂
[5:37:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: that intern was ready to go home
[5:37:08] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 they knew blizzard do nerfs mid raid, they could expect this to happen... Even people yesterday bet there would be a nerf today
[5:37:13] WeaponII: the pumps were pumping
[5:37:16] LuciWho: GZ!
[5:37:17] Raafuh: The knob employee after they killed it = ScaredyCat
[5:37:19] NinjaGlovz: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:37:21] firewalltwitch: @zodiec the nerfs were massive though, ur missing the point lol
[5:37:28] Zarcsby: push the nerf quick boys, we gotta get to the christmas lunch party soon
[5:37:29] lawles_walrus: THIS IS WHY YOU DON"T TRUST INTERNS
[5:37:35] Kinghorn: echo's damage was insane because they had like double the amount of grieftorches
[5:37:36] Holysal: @WeaponII yeah echo was head but that isnt hte point
[5:37:45] Zodiec: @firewalltwitch dont think I am lol
[5:37:49] Ultratide_: lets listen in
[5:37:58] g0n_z3n: Homer Simpson at the nerf button
[5:37:58] Holysal: @Kinghorn what are those?
[5:38:03] Ultratide_: nymnCorn
[5:38:05] resergz: done fucked up the race, great race right up to the last hours. Blizzard comes in a fucks all involved.
[5:38:05] firewalltwitch: literally BDGG couldve got world first if they logged on at the right time LUL
[5:38:25] Spadez_Zero: What is that in the top left corner? Is it a add on
[5:38:26] rosina_scarlett: China would 100% win with global release
[5:38:34] c0mmander_starscream: What's on the menu for Bruv Night tonight?
[5:38:34] Zodiec: @firewalltwitch thats not how it works mate
[5:38:37] Kinghorn: trinkets off broodmother Holysal that do insane dps
[5:38:42] WeaponII: @WeaponII Oh I understand the point entirely. This is a Blizzard fuck up 100%
[5:38:47] LuciWho: 28.28
[5:38:56] firewalltwitch: @zodiec its over ur head man, dotn worry, u wont ever get it LUL
[5:38:56] Niksen_99: Dont you think Liquid went to bed thinking there is a massive chance Echo would have killed the boss when they wake up nerf or not ?
[5:38:57] Drogdorf: catJAM
[5:38:57] Shrenko: catJAM
[5:39:00] snuffles_80: hahahaha

[5:39:10] pereadin: towComfy
[5:39:10] Shrenko: towDmca
[5:39:15] dreamwalker213: @provision_ again that brings it all back to blizzards mistake of scheduling the expansion the way they did
[5:39:16] vimie: vinceCry
[5:39:19] Sayryn: Which add on manager do you use?
[5:39:20] dutchie76: wham was the best
[5:39:20] Provision_: @Niksen_99 else they surely would moved their schedule yeah
[5:39:20] six_tracks: lol ruthless
[5:39:22] dwolters_the_zombieman: oh shit next month china might not be able do rwf
[5:39:22] Zodiec: @firewalltwitch ah the salt. delicious
[5:39:24] Djfarmville: The very next day you gave it away Sadge

[5:39:42] firewalltwitch: @zodiec i cheered for echo, still voer ur head
[5:39:45] firewalltwitch: over*
[5:39:53] Niksen_99: Yeah when best pull is below 10% there is always a chance lol @Provision_
[5:39:54] Thicc_Fil_A: wowwwww
[5:39:55] Thoreya: let him talk more
[5:39:55] Lokajin: End stop.
[5:39:57] dutchie76: wow
[5:39:57] Thoreya: he was sleeping

[5:40:21] dutchie76: true
[5:40:23] Niksen_99: They were told 2 hours ago but were asleep. too bad
[5:40:30] Provision_: That one time you snooze your phone LUL
[5:40:31] Yagr6: i dont like him taking the high roads
[5:40:33] lawles_walrus: THIS IS WHY YOU DON"T TRUST INTERNS
[5:40:34] Zodiec: @firewalltwitch you cant just make up progression on the spot. get real
[5:40:36] Doog45: but they are still wiping right now
[5:40:37] ClassicMalcontent: PREANNOUNCE IT. Basically. Not "2 min warning NERF INC" LUL
[5:40:39] evnaae: No he dont
[5:40:43] firewalltwitch: blizzard needs soem cookies
[5:40:43] gritbarontv: and saying to all to just move on about it
[5:40:45] Lilurrn: They were sleeping
[5:40:47] LegendaryViewer: @Provision_ KEKW
[5:40:49] Lilurrn: its just that
[5:40:50] Lokajin: @Niksen_99 he literally said they weren't informed himself
[5:40:57] iDeez88: Why not "Confirm" the leaders know, before actually pushing it?
[5:41:00] Hyelander_: They saw a dream about the nerf so they woke up in a cold sweat
[5:41:02] Steelen: Interns be like "im awake in EST. press release the kraken" 😂
[5:41:03] LadyJasmin: @towelliee read sloots title for today
[5:41:10] spookaninja_21: at this point blizz needs to release a statment
[5:41:10] dutchie76: very bad
[5:41:13] Provision_: @Lokajin he was informed, but were sleeping

[5:41:13] LuciWho: They were alseep @10am on peak race day
[5:41:17] Thoreya: @Lokajin they are in the same discord as echo. they were just sleeping
[5:41:21] Lilurrn: Isn't there a time window where both guilds are pulling?
[5:41:22] crawcook: I think there was a way, they should have told them that nerf is coming 8 hours before when both were still awake.
[5:41:24] Niksen_99: He said he didnt know but was told 2 hours ago :) @Lokajin
[5:41:25] dimofodi: I don't want to hear it, if the announcement was at like 11am PST, they should have had someone awake and in the Discord by then.
[5:41:27] Alienfromger: who is the leak? SwiftRage
[5:41:29] six_tracks: I'm dreaming of a nerfed christmas
[5:41:38] FRMTHEDENx: On the bright side blizzard is making great games and content LOL
[5:41:38] 1llum1n471: Again, it's not about the result. it's about the perception with a company already struggling with PR problems.
[5:41:42] ditaern: Their team should have a community manager awake while the raid team is sleeping imo. Blame isn't the sole issue.
[5:41:42] dwolters_the_zombieman: blizz ruined rwf
[5:41:47] Djfarmville: didnt max say that there isnt a good time for blizz to nerf?
[5:41:56] Lokajin: @Provision_ he was informed WHEN the hotfix went into effect not the timeline of when the hotfix would be applied. Those facts matter.
[5:41:57] Tartxo: agreed!
[5:41:58] firewalltwitch: blizzard ruined it
[5:41:58] deadxarrival: they made lfr where yuou can only get one piece of gear from needing so you cant be a loot ninja if you roll need on more than one peice and win one and you need on another piece and someone else does you dont even get a roll on it

[5:42:16] LeXieSterling: It wouldn't feel like they need to go take a shower. It's like dealing with a bad used car sales men
[5:42:17] myfans4141: wow look at that go
[5:42:17] Kinghorn: when echo was already 11 hours deep?
[5:42:20] emznev: can't change it now , it is what is ggs to both
[5:42:24] REALPolarbeezy: shouldnt any nerf or hotfix be done at regular server time?
[5:42:25] Steelen: when will Blizzard learn to invite all these people guilds to a localized event?
[5:42:28] WeaponII: That's okay because Microsoft will push the nerf inthe form of a Windows Update and force all their machines to restart mid pull

[5:42:30] acehornet2: max has to say that don't want to look salty
[5:42:30] Kinghorn: that doesnt seem fair
[5:42:34] crawcook: The time isn't that big that they couldn't wait for both teams to be awake.
[5:42:41] lawles_walrus: TBF, for an event as large as this, shouldn't you have somebody avaible at all times for this kind of thing?

[5:42:50] Arkitek: did we hear scribe actually say it or we only have that info from the donation?
[5:42:51] Shrenko: didnt ECHO have over 100 more pulls on the boss ??
[5:42:55] ditaern: But then people would say Liquid had the advantage because they were well rested, and Echo were not
[5:42:58] Dcarter: Pull count don’t matter
[5:42:58] Djfarmville: Its fair to nerf when one team is 11 hours in and the other is just starting?
[5:42:59] Dcarter: Lol
[5:43:03] Sweet_Lou__: at the same time, not having a contingency plan in which this scenario was discussed is on them. Going for a WF, you need to account for ANYTHING imo
[5:43:04] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[5:43:04] Roth___: Echo wasnt going to stop when they were getting the boss that low anyway, so its not like they were going to sleep before the nerf.
[5:43:04] Dcarter: What are these takes
[5:43:04] captain_khyzan: EITHER WAY! ECHO WAS AHEAD AND OUTPERFORMED. no denying that regardless of bad blizzard move outcome be the same
[5:43:05] Joeyz1234: @kinghorn but it’s more fair when one of the competitions isn’t on??  lolol
[5:43:08] olbearic: @lawles_walrus entirely my thoughts as well
[5:43:11] Steelen: Pulls dont matter lol
[5:43:18] Zodiec: @firewalltwitch why so childish? say what you wanne say
[5:43:19] LeXieSterling: He is being a gentleman and a good sport. He doesn't have to say what everyone really knows.
[5:43:20] rosina_scarlett: Liquid chain pulls where Echo takes 5-10 mins between pulls
[5:43:20] Thoreya: @Shrenko opposite. liquid pulled way more, but pull counts are irrelevant
[5:43:22] Lokajin: @Shrenko other way around liquid had more pulls.
[5:43:23] Shrenko: didnt say it matters just asked
[5:43:26] faeria30: As both of them having staff, how was someone not monitoring 27-7? But agree that blizz should have waited til now for the nerf
[5:43:28] rosina_scarlett: so yeah pull count don't matter
[5:43:29] Provision_: Echo was planning to go from 5am to 4am if needed. So yeah
[5:43:29] DaBoogyeman: thing is they still cant beat it now even after the nerf
[5:43:29] dimofodi: Nah you have to wait until Nef phase starts
[5:43:34] firewalltwitch: @zodiec over ur head, stop typing LUL
[5:43:34] akia03: max is part owner of liquid right
[5:43:35] myfans4141: valuable information indeed
[5:43:40] lawles_walrus: i mean for an org as large as Liquid, i think you need to have someone at the ready to gather this info
[5:43:53] Zodiec: @firewalltwitch good troll
[5:44:03] firewalltwitch: Kungen got world first
[5:44:13] LeXieSterling: Towelliee righ. That guy has to live in the world first competitive world. Towelliee doesn't. So Towelliee can say what he wants
[5:44:14] Provision_: @lawles_walrus would make sense, also blizzard should had waited until both confirmed
[5:44:14] Steelen: @lawles_walrus don't matter if everyone sleeps and you're the only guy awake lol
[5:44:34] Lokajin: and kungen did it all without discord and weak aura's
[5:44:34] Zavier420: lol
[5:44:35] Lokajin: the real chad
[5:44:35] tocu: did he confirm Jaina is a Dreadlord ?
[5:44:43] LeXieSterling: Right
[5:44:47] Steelen: What I don't understand is that, it felt like Liquid woke up late every day. where as Echo woke up decent hours
[5:44:51] Provision_: @Steelen and you cant orgenize for them to wake up within a hour? LUL
[5:44:53] LeXieSterling: You should lol

[5:44:54] NinjaGlovz: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:44:55] Shrenko: @Thoreya @Lokajin oh Liquid is playing VOD lol I got baited by that
[5:44:55] DeanoTV: KEKW
[5:44:56] rosina_scarlett: I would love to see a global release. would give skyline an actual chance to take WF from Echo and Liquid
[5:44:59] pereadin: KEKW
[5:45:00] olbearic: he is THE dreadlord
[5:45:02] firewalltwitch: i wanna see towelliee raid with kungen Kappa

[5:45:17] happybooger: buy the pet?
[5:45:19] Shrenko: just buy the pet on AH
[5:45:20] jeffnsteff2019: we still got more  content to go  this expac
[5:45:25] Steelen: @provision_ travel. they aren't sleeping at the facility
[5:45:30] Raafuh: What’s that addon
[5:45:37] Puppette: pretty sure they sleep in their own hotel rooms lol
[5:45:40] emznev: is kungen the guy who streams once every 2 years?
[5:45:40] Puppette: what a weird take
[5:45:43] Provision_: @lawles_walrus all Liquid are at the same location, should be easy to get them up
[5:46:11] tocu: its an out of 3 pet

[5:46:12] Steelen: Someone's never been to Cali 💀
[5:46:49] Goatsguffle: what addon is showing you the list?
[5:46:50] metavahn231: is max malding
[5:46:58] Scoodles91: @jeffnsteff2019 nope only patch this expac, see you in the next one
[5:47:00] firewalltwitch: Blizzard needs to get better too, wont happen
[5:47:03] Holysal: @elixirfield1 no
[5:47:06] Lilurrn: Was it underperform playing or behind the scenes
[5:47:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: The roadmap was just released, 2 more raids next year
[5:47:11] Zodiec: @Goatsguffle weakaura. tamas dragon flight
[5:47:17] elfwyn20: @Towelliee  what race do you think is BIS for guardian druid?
[5:47:18] emznev: last time liquid  won was bfa right?
[5:47:20] PotbellyGoat: speaking of underperforming - Zach Wilson
[5:47:22] Holysal: @elixirfield1 it seems to not bother him at all
[5:47:22] Provision_: I just still find it weird that Liquid decided to sleep it out until 10am knowing Echo was ahead...
[5:47:22] Zippaya: Max is so nice dude, I would like to see them win next one
[5:47:28] Steelen: I for one, will not be rushing this expansion. I normally raid and skip the rest. I'm doing it reverse for a change. not raiding till I am done lol
[5:47:29] crawcook: Even with morales low they didn't one shot it like Echo did.
[5:47:31] Malnar1123: @Goatsguffle All The Tings
[5:47:31] Holysal: @Lilurrn both
[5:47:32] MIKEBRASKA: Max felt like they performed very well including Raz but straight up said Echo killed it on Raz and gave them props
[5:47:34] 1llum1n471: strategists don't affect dps lacking
[5:47:35] Flyingboots: I love Liquids atmosphere but maybe don't talk about what energy drink is shit and if they've given away hondas mid pull could help with focus xd
[5:47:42] Holysal: @emznev CN
[5:47:53] rosina_scarlett: Echo has the mad lad and numbers genius Roger
[5:47:53] Richton867: I really hope Blizzard embrace the RWF more in the future and make it an official event, with better structure.
[5:47:56] Shrenko: just run more m+ 4Head
[5:47:58] im_capy: I keep hearing preach say a lot of individual gameplay is what carried echo
[5:47:59] firewalltwitch: yep
[5:48:05] emznev: @holysal ah yes I remember now ty
[5:48:13] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: While You Were Sleeping 2, with Sandra Bullock as Raszageth Kappa
[5:48:14] MIKEBRASKA: they played outta their mind on that boss
[5:48:15] Lilurrn: but echo also had the blueprint before they started
[5:48:17] jaalexba: WoW is a lot like soccer maybe.  Kappa
[5:48:21] emznev: @holysal shadowlands was a blur for me lol
[5:48:23] metavahn231: some of the tech of echo was insane
[5:48:29] tocu: Echo did just drop a 40% discount on any 1 displate for today
[5:48:33] rosina_scarlett: Echo subbing in Roger for the last dps slot was the play tbh
[5:48:34] baffliction: Like it was the first rwf where all modes opened at the same time there was always gonna be some difficulty
[5:48:42] Daarksyde: might be liquid kill here
[5:48:53] Niksen_99: If they didnt sleep to 10 am they would have known tho KEKW
[5:48:57] Holysal: @emznev same I quit in SL and still deciding if I want to come back for DF lol
[5:48:59] Lilurrn: Liquid out there creating the strat and echo comes in and fine tunes it faster
[5:49:00] rosina_scarlett: Liquid close to a kill
[5:49:04] LegendaryViewer: Limit probably killing
[5:49:07] dimofodi: They pushed out nerfs while Echo was sleeping too didn't they?
[5:49:23] emznev: @holysal I hated shadowlands , can say df is so much more fun
[5:49:23] WeaponII: I think they're warmed up

[5:49:26] LearnedSomething: I don't have a problem with how blizz handled it personally
[5:49:27] Steelen: @towelliee you think Blizzard should fly all these are orgs in for a localized event?
[5:49:28] Provision_: @dimofodi yes, but well this is final boss
[5:49:39] im_capy: it was a thing of art
[5:49:41] Holysal: @Steelen no
[5:49:46] dimofodi: @Provision_ The did on this boss too.
[5:49:48] Zodiec: the portal at end was insane
[5:49:51] metavahn231: damn max looks annoyed
[5:49:53] rosina_scarlett: that storm is such a joke. LUL
[5:49:54] Syrc0: Different take on that: Shouldn´t Liquid as a Team and Orga not make sure to be up to date at all times? Maybe have some guys on nightshift or something to keep up with information from blizzard and other raiders?
[5:50:00] firewalltwitch: EU brain too big
[5:50:03] Malnar1123: Damn Echo were so far ahead on damage
[5:50:15] Provision_: @dimofodi well without the nerfs they prob need another week of resets before they had the DPS
[5:50:17] Layercake: Pretty impressive that Echo lost 3 top members (Fragnance, Deepshades and Jethe) and still maintain the level
[5:50:21] CriticalPhil: they dont have it
[5:50:23] WeaponII: does anyone know if either guild had any splits left, assuming the race continued into next week?
[5:50:29] emznev: it's an indie company ffs LUL
[5:50:38] omidiart: @Towelliee blizzard will sell another pet to fly them out, then tell everyone they gotta handle their own and transport lol
[5:50:44] Steelen: Kinda like Steam does with their games?
[5:50:44] Provision_: @Syrc0 as big they are, i would expect the least
[5:50:45] Larc9783: Shhhh, I like free stuff
[5:50:53] rosina_scarlett: Liquids damage is so low
[5:50:55] bloodogg35: why did blizzard get involved
[5:50:59] crawcook: Twitter mentioning is harmless, but other than that they should just stay away.
[5:51:15] rosina_scarlett: 30 seconds till a 4th br
[5:51:17] WeaponII: 5?
[5:51:18] Provision_: @bloodogg35 they want this to be over before chrismas
[5:51:25] Malnar1123: Nah they done
[5:51:26] NinjaGlovz: monkaS monkaS monkaS
[5:51:34] Zippaya: this is it
[5:51:42] deadxarrival: they also had twice as many attempts as echo did
[5:51:47] Malnar1123: Raz healed
[5:51:48] Xockel: wipe
[5:51:49] Ryvden: wipe
[5:51:52] bloodogg35: then they should of started earlier
[5:51:52] Zodiec: it healed already
[5:51:53] rosina_scarlett: raz healed
[5:52:00] Malnar1123: Man that just shows how far ahead Echo are on damage
[5:52:01] Provision_: Echo played it flawless yeah
[5:52:11] rosina_scarlett: Raz was at 8% then went to 18%
[5:52:15] Sweet_Lou__: wow wasted opportunity, late B rezzes out too
[5:52:15] metavahn231: they gave echo the win to get it over with
[5:52:16] Alsparq: rasz heal
[5:52:19] Ryvden: why didnt they use the portal to get the circles out like echo did
[5:52:20] CloudPants8081: atpRtsd
[5:52:22] WeaponII: 100%
[5:52:24] Luckyminten: Echo had great dps there

[5:52:26] Bashar_Strygar: That is a happy note?
[5:52:29] Lokajin: that was pull 4
[5:52:35] WeaponII: I think some are flying into the storm so I hope they make it safely
[5:52:36] Shrenko: most Echo roster celebrate christmas tomorrow, they need to hurry lol
[5:52:36] mavericks312: echo better send blizz a nice xmas gift
[5:52:39] crawcook: Yeah these Liquid wipes just proves Echo would have won anyway
[5:52:44] Ryvden: *warlock gate
[5:52:45] CloudPants8081: tppowerHeresTommy
[5:52:50] LearnedSomething: liquid got most bosses
[5:52:54] Alaquane: 11
[5:52:54] LearnedSomething: echo got the big one
[5:52:55] Holysal: @mavericks312 nah echo as far ahead
[5:52:57] WeaponII: 11
[5:52:57] LearnedSomething: all is good
[5:52:57] smashwow: 11
[5:52:58] Densetsu_: @Towelliee Echo won cuz they have 2 former HotS pros in their team Kappa
[5:52:58] metavahn231: people can continue to rage in M+ while ignoring this tiers RFW
[5:53:01] eakiller: 11
[5:53:04] smashwow: it's 11
[5:53:05] c0mmander_starscream: Coming home for xmas to see my hookers and blow
[5:53:09] StreamingCake: 11
[5:53:14] Alaquane: yes
[5:53:16] WeaponII: Yes
[5:53:17] firewalltwitch: @crawcook if u ever played sports, losing motivation hurts a lot too, though echo was always better
[5:53:17] Provision_: @crawcook we would not have known, they not on their A game since no more pressure
[5:53:19] Alaquane: 11 for Liquid
[5:53:23] Malnar1123: So weird how Blizzard made it exactly how long Morgan said Kappa
[5:53:30] Niksen_99: Ofc that counts? You see how far behind Liquid was on that last pull lol
[5:53:49] metavahn231: still better than 99.9% of players LUL
[5:54:05] Luckyminten: Echo healers was insane also
[5:54:05] Djfarmville: moar dots
[5:54:13] firewalltwitch: echo clearly better, but if the nerfs happen last night well echo sleeping, liquid win
[5:54:14] Provision_: Echo did not even expected that kill, they were eating pizza etc LUL
[5:54:22] tocu: that kill pull was just a work of art
[5:54:39] Alaquane: echo were very consistent
[5:54:42] Lokajin: @Provision_ that and it comes down to timing cause if liquid gets up and gets enough pulls in to warm up and get into a rhythm then its a proper race but ya if liquid had to do a pull cold fresh off the hotfix to a fully in toon in rhythm echo then ya echo wins hands down.
[5:54:48] crawcook: @firewalltwitch yeah maybe, but even considering morales, the nerf is so significant, I feel if they had it, they wouldn't be doing it for the 6-7th time now.
[5:54:51] jaysteea: reminds me of Method Jaina doublekill
[5:54:58] Niksen_99: you are delusional for thinking that LUL @firewalltwitch
[5:55:04] dimofodi: Kill enough trash
[5:55:09] WainDOC: liquid is on track to be world third XD
[5:55:13] BlueBlurPrime: %
[5:55:15] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: just kill a bunch of stuff
[5:55:17] tocu: you need 3 horns for the boss
[5:55:17] Zodiec: the difference is that echo would have waken up and got raiding. depending on the timing of course. would have called in early
[5:55:19] Ezekyler: clear the area
[5:55:19] citrinesoan: i deleted Asmongold, you are my, main WoW player!  teamliquidEZ echo aka echo... lol echo; what happened? i will be right back.
[5:55:20] firewalltwitch: @crawcook we will never know, aka F blizzard
[5:55:25] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: horns will sound
[5:55:35] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: yes
[5:55:36] tocu: 3

[5:56:03] firewalltwitch: @Niksen_99 typed like someone who never played sports LUL
[5:56:07] Lilurrn: Liquid had some really smooth attempts last night right before max said they were going to sleep and killing tomorrow its hard to say if the nerf last night would have impacted them deciding to grind a few more hours or reset and get it today
[5:56:16] Provision_: @BlueDuckFunk max said so
[5:56:31] dreamwalker213: They wouldn’t have killed it in one pull like echo but most likely would’ve died last night
[5:56:34] tocu: I havent bothered to kill him in years after getting the rag mount i just go for the bird
[5:56:39] mjyzzzt: towGold
[5:56:56] Provision_: @Lilurrn well they would not had killed it without a nerf tbh
[5:57:01] Lilurrn: Its hard to compare a guilds attempts 11 hrs in vs just waking up
[5:57:13] firewalltwitch: Ricky Bobby said it best, "if your not first, youre last"

[5:57:37] Funderik: echo just wanted to win more.
[5:57:39] PinkDolphinSkincare: Still sucks tho... for me its still a us (USA) vs them
[5:57:44] sosadu: TL still getting wiped over and over, patch didnt do anything i think
[5:57:45] CDubTheRIPper: next time theyll have dedicated discord people LUL
[5:57:46] jilech: yeah the reset was 5 am EU time
[5:57:46] emznev: towRed
[5:57:55] Provision_: Echo went early and than did 18hours. Now they went got up early to get this push
[5:58:03] Funderik: echo healers are fucking insane
[5:58:04] stabzmcgeee: echo stacked with some of the goats of wow
[5:58:06] CDubTheRIPper: or just not have the discord channel in general like you said
[5:58:09] PinkDolphinSkincare: Naw, Echo is SMOOOTH... amazing players
[5:58:11] xhale2nhale: D'VA said it best, "Nerf this"
[5:58:11] your_sister_2499: why does the mount walk its weird
[5:58:15] lawles_walrus: It feels like liquid wasn't "prepared" or "organized" this race. Late going to bed, late getting started, behind on DPS almost the whole race
[5:58:21] dimofodi: That's the reason Echo keeps winning. They don't need to touch anything but they will.
[5:58:28] Goatsguffle: what addon tells you that list?
[5:58:34] LeXieSterling: Do the Casinos in Las Vegas let people put bets on the world first?
[5:58:39] tocu: Did Liquid do the loot hold thing ? aka what echo did holding loot till mythic and a bit further

[5:58:50] firewalltwitch: echo doesn't have swifty, they need to improve there roster
[5:58:50] Niksen_99: Liquid would wake up 10 am and echo would wake up 5 am. the difference lol
[5:58:52] xhale2nhale: nah Liquid was kicking ass this entire race, they just fell short on last
[5:59:05] dreamwalker213: Being on the west coast doesn’t help either
[5:59:06] Provision_: @Goatsguffle top left? "All the things" i believe
[5:59:07] LeXieSterling: If people were betting on the world first and wow gave information to help one team over another holly cow that would not be good
[5:59:17] PinkDolphinSkincare: @lawles_walrus Liquids channels were awful this time
[5:59:21] dimofodi: Echo streams when I'm waking up until I'm almost home from work. Liquid didn't start until after lunch in my timezone.
[5:59:25] PinkDolphinSkincare: very boring
[5:59:30] Holysal: @xhale2nhale like every raid since CN
[5:59:33] Malnar1123: LOL
[5:59:33] emznev: @lexiesterling towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:59:34] tocu: They also had 3 invokers in the line up which likely helped
[5:59:38] ElfIako: why are they not making to race time based with time windows to raid for each region instead of the first to get the kill win... would make it fair for all region and wouldnt matter too much when the hotfix are pushed out
[5:59:45] Zodiec: no eu partner guild hurt liquid viewership imo
[5:59:54] Zettabyte: Or Rich Kappa
[6:00:02] Funderik: liquid just lacked on main stream honestly, they tried to over produce and it felt so unrelatable.
[6:00:03] Tyr7: Who has more sponsorship for RWF? echo or liquid?
[6:00:06] jilech: but still lacking viewers compared to earlier Method years where there was 200K watching
[6:00:11] Niksen_99: Liquid and Echo should just play on the same server
[6:00:14] LegendaryViewer: what a about a RWF realm?
[6:00:17] Holysal: @dimofodi there on pst
[6:00:18] Affiiance: And yet they catered by nerfing the boss on a Friday...
[6:00:20] xhale2nhale: @Holysal I haven't watch any of SL races so idk
[6:00:32] Cheapesttactics1: what's a fast way to get valor?
[6:00:35] dreamwalker213: Imagine telling 99.9% of the player base “hey you’re weekly reset is at 4 am”
[6:00:43] Provision_: But they could do it as MDI tho?
[6:00:47] Lilurrn: What is the downside to not global release just to cater to 3 guilds though?
[6:00:56] Holysal: Liquid has a leadership issue imo
[6:01:30] dreamwalker213: @lilurrn because time zones exist, weekly reset would be in the middle of the night for parts of the world
[6:01:31] omgitsbby: Interesting take
[6:01:32] Alsparq: im not upset with echo and i feel they earned it, but i feel blizzard messed it up bad
[6:01:56] Doog45: agreed

[6:02:08] Niksen_99: yeah dont be upset about echo they would have won anyway LUL
[6:02:17] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 well they could do it as MDI, scheduled times etc.
[6:02:17] Menisong: I get the impression from Max that he is always looking for some crazy, blow your mind strat, whil Echo just finds a workable strat, hones in on it and kills it
[6:02:17] firewalltwitch: people think its NA vs EU, its not, its about blizzard
[6:02:20] 1x_slayer_x1: have a wicked chrissy @Towelliee
[6:02:27] Funderik: there's no correct way for bliz to hot fix tho, they did a few when echo were almost done and one when they were asleep.
[6:02:36] tocu: Now we wait to see who is 3rd BDGG or method  I am rooting for Sloot myself

[6:02:40] Sweet_Lou__: this Raid was Shadow Priest transmog heaven
[6:02:40] crawcook: It's hard for a company not to try to stick it's nose once they know it's such a big marketing event for the game.
[6:02:45] Ezekyler: yeah, firelands got good tmogs
[6:02:46] PinkDolphinSkincare: giggety
[6:02:47] Chiphazzord: ooohh my

[6:02:57] Razor_33: nothing i love more than his sack
[6:02:59] Bl4ckSauce: his ballsack Kappa
[6:02:59] Provision_: @Funderik how about more than 2 hours frontal warning? Like 10 hours so both teams can schedule for it?
[6:03:02] RENDH: Not gona lie.. watching you hunt down mogs is what is making me want to go back to WoW after so many years. lool @Towelliee
[6:03:03] Kratosjr1: Thats Gross Just his SACK
[6:03:03] Holysal: @Funderik correct and shouldnt of touched the fight

[6:03:43] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 well why can't they make it that raid open on schedule for those? It not an indie dev team right? LUL
[6:03:44] AvrithSATX: Towelliee: "Look at me. Look at ME! I am the Clause now."

[6:04:59] olbearic: @Alsparq You can feel blizz messed it up.  but liquid caught up in percent a 9pm and chose to keep pulling till 4 am. lol

[6:05:27] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee but youre a nobody.. so i am alone... Kappa
[6:05:27] dreamwalker213: @provision_ because RWF is a community ran event no blizzard. There would be no more splits with viewers/helpers. Community interaction would go away which imo is why RWF is better then MDI and AWC
[6:05:29] Zettabyte: You'll Never Walk Alone!
[6:05:37] veryhairyheyyall: So grateful <3 thanks towel
[6:05:38] Razor_33: towLove towLove

[6:06:08] TheOGDaywalker: Merry Christmas yall, yall aint alone
[6:06:12] LeXieSterling: So nice...
[6:06:21] PvtHudson093: i hate doing this boss
[6:06:23] Troggie: my first xmas without my mama this year =( she passed 3 months ago
[6:06:24] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 well if it not a blizzard event, why they nerf mid week? Community nerfs are on schedules. If they dont orgenize it. than dont mess with it
[6:06:30] CloudPants8081: towChad
[6:06:37] tocu: I kinda want to see if i can still do the skip here was a giga pain last time i tried
[6:06:45] batmum3: my holiday plans are screwed this year..... Finally ended up catching covid. :( So I will probably be joining you Towelliee
[6:06:45] xhale2nhale: mines was some noodles n a bar of Powerstick, which my Ant stills get me every year
[6:06:53] xhale2nhale: Aunt*
[6:06:54] tydrennistv: No, visit
[6:07:06] UncleBliz: Bah, people are complaining about the timing of the nerf but Liquid still has not killed Raz.
[6:07:08] spookychefkarolina: Damn that’s a deep commitment for them Pokes
[6:07:09] stabzmcgeee: 1st xmas divorced/without the kids kinda hits different
[6:07:10] dreamwalker213: @provision_ well that’s exactly the point of this whole conversation…blizzard fucked up
[6:07:19] PvtHudson093: Card breaking on Christmas?
[6:07:22] tydrennistv: We buy and sell as a couple hobby we go to cons and everything
[6:07:33] wakytv_: @stabzmcgeee stay strong brother
[6:07:41] kelticc: sweet im in
[6:07:42] Provision_: @UncleBliz well they have noting to race for, 2nd place is theirs easily
[6:07:51] JokaThS: how it should
[6:07:51] kelticc: i know that feeling
[6:07:57] gritbarontv: lol

[6:08:07] crawcook: Be our daddy Kappa
[6:08:08] stabzmcgeee: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP actually made me smile
[6:08:22] spookychefkarolina: We’ll be temporarily be the fruit of your loins
[6:08:28] WainDOC: even with nerfs liquid cant kill it
[6:08:29] Brodih_: dayum went to the gym, came back and Echo got it!
[6:08:38] akia03: the poor guy at bliz double clicked and only needed 1 click
[6:08:59] Lilurrn: Do you think this race will change future race strategy? For example, Do you think Limit will invest more time gearing instead of going into raid asap. Is there a world where Liquid and Echo start prog at the same time?
[6:09:02] tocu: i do hate how this bosses toy is druid only

[6:09:07] dreamwalker213: There’s also a difference between pulling right after waking up like liquid is doing, and pulling all day and being in a groove like echo was
[6:09:29] wdotk: @Towelliee  do you think given liquid u.s server resets first before eu gace liquid enough time to down last boss but regardless of the nerd they werent up to the level
[6:09:44] Brodih_: @dreamwalker213 very true!
[6:09:45] wdotk: nerf*
[6:09:55] Bl4ckSauce: Can you beat Ragnaros ?
[6:10:30] c0mmander_starscream: China FortOne
[6:10:33] instant_savage: @Towelliee why cant the mythic raid just come out at a non reset time like 3pm globla on a friday
[6:10:34] Lilurrn: It took more than reset for this race anyway and Liquid kept going back and forth doing additional splits and M+ during prog
[6:10:43] LearnedSomething: if it's community driven, can't the community organize fair rules for participants?
[6:10:50] Provision_: Have a schedule release for the raid, not the patch seems option
[6:10:51] crawcook: Gearing is a big part of the race so how would they handle that on the ptr?
[6:10:53] Zippaya: even than, someone will need to raid during night
[6:10:55] g0nk: Make it timed as in how long it takes instead of who gets it first time of day?
[6:11:00] RedDeadFredd: this raid release was definitely better than the full split raid release for "fairness" sake
[6:11:03] akia03: but than eu and na will never win
[6:11:16] Provision_: @Zippaya you think they care? they raid 18 hours LUL
[6:11:16] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:11:16] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: fly all the teams to MSG and nobody leaves until someone downs it
[6:11:25] WainDOC: tournament realm would be most fair
[6:11:26] jilech: Liquid could just wait and start same time as Echo, since Liquid has no competition from na guilds
[6:11:31] Brodih_: live realm since they want the achievement no?
[6:11:36] Kisswani: that would fuck up splits as well
[6:11:58] Provision_: Let the world wide release of raid be like 10 hours after patch so all catched up?
[6:12:01] mrsuflakis: fixed ilvlv
[6:12:17] jerkass: Is it a legal issue to not have reset at same time? "global reset" ?
[6:12:18] iDeez88: Most fair way? PTR RWF Realm with all people having the same 410 gear and consumables

[6:12:23] Brodih_: now lets hope that Sloot and BDGG get 3rd
[6:12:24] comp1: its better than liquid getting cuck like this
[6:12:24] UncleBliz: The question I have is if activating the raids actually requires server downtime. Can they get it to the point that raids just activate at a certain time across all servers?
[6:12:34] RedDeadFredd: Couldn't they just hold off nerfs until peak time around the world for the most "fair" fight under the current circumstances?

[6:12:44] Lilurrn: I wouldnt be a fan of that type of race that sounds like a 1 time event type of thing
[6:12:44] dreamwalker213: Part of the RWF hype and enjoyment is the gearing process and the different strategies used to do so. Tournament realm with fixed ilvl ruins that
[6:12:52] xendros78: thiccnaros
[6:13:07] WainDOC: BDGG is gonna be second
[6:13:41] Provision_: @dreamwalker213 you mean you also forget they throw a lot of money at it buying BoE etc? All teams having same resources would actually make it a fair race
[6:13:43] Ginentonic: there's no way to do it which is why it ultimately doesn't matter...NA will always have the early advantage with EU taking the lead at the end
[6:13:43] Holysal: nah liquid will kill it today
[6:13:58] Lilurrn: Liquid has today to kill because the facility will be closed for the holiday. There is a scenario where BDGG could snipe #2
[6:14:05] Provision_: @Ginentonic why? MDI does not have this
[6:14:09] alphadonnut: dont allow "changees" without 24 hour notice. they dont need a patch day. any change to raid first will happen at X time...period. be awake then or miss out
[6:14:31] agg_ie: BD said sometihing about a lot of their raiders out right now due to power lines down because of teh storm...dont know for sure though
[6:14:33] Ginentonic: @Provision_ MDI is a tournament realm
[6:14:49] mavericks312: you know that shit is eating them up

[6:15:02] comp1: i would be piss
[6:15:07] Provision_: @Ginentonic well Blizzard could do same for RWF. To remove all this mess
[6:15:08] Shrenko: according to their tweets they are not happy
[6:15:08] MoonwalkingAngel79: i bet demotivatdd
[6:15:09] breadthx: LUL
[6:15:20] firewalltwitch: swifty has more pinkys then towelliee
[6:15:21] Brodih_: and swifty loooves pvp
[6:15:30] Sneekzx: You don't go from being #1 to #2 without it demoralizing you no matter the sport you are in. Nobody likes losing
[6:15:31] Larc9783: Swifty is 60?!
[6:15:34] UncleBliz: It's not embarrassing to come in second, but if they blow it and BDGG gets second, Liquid is done
[6:15:35] Niksen_99: If they dont kill it today every Liquid.. there is no reason to be mad about the nerfs lol
[6:15:39] NinjaGlovz: towOny towOny towOny
[6:15:43] Ginentonic: @Provision_ You can't though...BoEs, splits would be gone

[6:15:47] PvtHudson093: twitlonger incoming
[6:15:48] dreamwalker213: @provision_ of course that’s also part of it but are you saying it’s that much of an advantage that that’s the reason echo won? Because they did have the bigger budget. Buying BOEs is very minor, especially nowadays
