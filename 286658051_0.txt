[0:41:31] barnabebrightstrider: Azerite traits feel underwhelming, a la relics with proc buffs. Current play styles feel like cheap rehashes of legendaries/artifact traits. I understand playstyle shock is a big deal, but reFRESHing classes is important to me and others each expansion. Is there a redesign?
