[0:39:04] cormander002: Max don't run keys. He doesn't know.
[0:39:04] Calair_: quick drop a sponsor plug
[0:39:06] ren0m: "If you had Samsung SSD"
[0:39:40] skFriberg: @cormander002 Is your rio higher than his? ;)
[0:39:49] ren0m: They could use the finish for an ad "Samsung SSD, slightly faster, but sometimes it's enough"
[0:39:51] bublzzzz: @jdotb should I spill the "it matters who puts in key with respect to their ping diff" secret strat I taught Echo?
[0:40:22] bublzzzz: You can get a full like extra half second on the key
[0:40:39] ren0m: Now, can you explain how to properly bait orbs on the second-to-last boss, please? Is there even the right way to do it? @jdotb
[0:40:47] brewteafulgaming: Hi all

[0:41:09] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:41:11] ren0m: The gravity orb
[0:41:15] AlsoZen: He is talking about Sol
[0:41:37] ren0m: So it's more about the group positioning well
[0:41:38] gelth: if you can see a place to be that will not grip everyone towards fire. be there
[0:41:44] ren0m: Rather than on the player to drop it in the right place
[0:41:51] AlsoZen: Agreed, be in a predictable position behind the dps. so they know to kite backwards
[0:41:51] ren0m: Ah gotcha
[0:42:02] scheriel: 4m dps
[0:42:06] scheriel: wth
[0:42:09] flawlesslykun: THEY MIGHT ACTUALY DIE

[0:56:40] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[0:57:04] flawlesslykun: that was so fucking close on both matches dude
[0:57:13] flawlesslykun: i hope they fight it out again
[0:57:35] Vranan: bald WM was 14.38 yesterday, 13.13 today, not even close to win with yesterday time
[0:57:37] Calair_: I don't think that 30seconds faster stat is accurate. RIO shows Bald's WM timer yesterday as 14:38
[0:58:16] Vranan: it was a chat info from max Kappa
[0:59:21] bublzzzz: yeah didn't they have to reset goliath?
[0:59:48] AGuyWithPants: i thought dawgs had to reset goliath

[1:03:35] Vranan: imo the fact there is less room for wild stuffs make it closer but less fun (echo was crazy good to find these shits)
[1:03:54] bublzzzz: @jdotb clickz died while being at 4m dps. his death could literally have lost 100m damage
[1:04:02] scheriel: Honestly I wouldn't mind echo not winning MDI lol

[1:08:55] Redivna: there's fast and slow rp?
[1:12:23] Celissah: I believe the Echo v. Bald Bandits might have been the best match ever in MDI history. Unmatched how great both of the teams played.
[1:12:25] Charm_pit: ???
[1:12:32] flawlesslykun: KEKW

[1:15:42] Celissah: But they are playing 1 healer and 3 dps though!?! :D
[1:16:23] scheriel: oh wtf 16 deaths on perplexed
[1:17:00] WytherOK: are the mobs objectively bugging out not grounds for a remake?
[1:17:27] Calair_: @WytherOK doesn't prevent dungeon completion = no remake
[1:17:38] flawlesslykun: i don't even feel sorry for them. I love snapping fucking you in the ass EZ
[1:17:42] kelly_mac06: @WytherOK maybe no when they caused the bug unintentionally and also what Calair said
[1:17:49] kelly_mac06: can still complete the dungeon, no reason to remake
[1:17:52] gelth: I wanna see

[1:20:39] Celissah: Mind saying what the stuff on Maiden was later? :)
[1:20:39] flawlesslykun: if they don't fix snapping for next expac for good, it's going to be so fucking dogshit jb
[1:20:46] flawlesslykun: i am actualy tired of this dogshit abuse
[1:21:02] gelth: why you so mad
[1:21:03] flawlesslykun: i know u pro's like this sort of stuff, but it is actualy so dogshit
[1:21:04] gelth: about snapping
[1:21:11] flawlesslykun: how are u not mad
[1:21:13] flawlesslykun: 3 expacs
[1:21:19] flawlesslykun: and they still didn't completly fix it
[1:21:24] flawlesslykun: u pay a sub to play this game
[1:21:26] kelly_mac06: i dont get why snapping is something to be mad about
[1:21:27] flawlesslykun: are u kidding me ?
[1:21:32] kelly_mac06: it's fun to find shit like that
[1:21:33] gelth: why does it need to be "fixed"
[1:21:36] Bledgor: personally I find snapping stupid, so glad it fucks up
[1:21:44] gelth: I'm okay with it being risky
[1:21:45] Celissah: @jdotb Mind saying what the stuff on Maiden was later?
[1:21:47] Riicky_tv: i stand by
[1:21:56] flawlesslykun: BECAUSE ITS A DOGSHIT ABUSE OF A SCUFFED GAME MECANIC FRIEND THATS WHY IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED
[1:21:56] kelly_mac06: @gelth it SHOULD be risky
[1:21:57] Riicky_tv: remove snapping, or revert the last 5 attempts of fixing it
[1:22:00] flawlesslykun: ESPECIALY IN A MDI SETTING
[1:22:12] gelth: lol okay "it's bad because it's bad" isn't a reason
[1:22:29] lofibanshee: @flawlesslykun what would they be fixing? The alternative is that the mobs just go right back.
[1:22:48] Bledgor: its bad because it creates notable issues blizzard has to work around, it encourages fucked up gameplay and as we know what happens at hte top trickles down
[1:22:52] kelly_mac06: can you explain what about it is detrimental to the MDI? genuinely curious
[1:22:56] Guffels: mdi is literally the 'break the game' competition. nobody complains about glitches in an% speedrunning, MDI is the same thing
[1:22:57] Celissah: What was the maiden stuff?
[1:23:08] Guffels: any%*
[1:23:16] flawlesslykun: @kelly_mac06 exactly what @Bledgor just said
[1:23:21] flawlesslykun: ppl watch this shit
[1:23:25] flawlesslykun: and go do this on live
[1:23:26] gelth: what are these notable issuse
[1:23:27] lofibanshee: @Bledgor You're not doing that pull in live keys, sorry
[1:23:28] TheTyin: @Guffels as any other speedrun game
[1:23:29] flawlesslykun: and they when it goes wrong
[1:23:33] flawlesslykun: it's a cesspool of toxicity
[1:23:45] Guffels: tgp is the competition that needs to reflect live, mdi should be the most broken version of the game imo
[1:23:46] Bledgor: @lofibanshee that specific pull? no, but lets not ignore snapping is used in live keys
[1:24:09] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[1:24:11] gelth: is there a key in the current pool where snaps are expected for routing in live keys?
[1:24:11] kelly_mac06: i guess i dont see anything wrong with high risk high reward play, if you're wanting to attempt it, you need to be ready to accept the consequence when it fails
[1:24:19] Bledgor: @lofibanshee and it creates a loop were people feel it is needed to do, and when he fucks up cause it is sketchy use of game mechanics at best it can brick keys and kill desire to do keys cause it is iffy
[1:24:25] Exogenesis9: It was in Ted Lasso
[1:24:30] Calair_: real test: does JPC know the bit
[1:24:41] flawlesslykun: it's also really fucking bad for "metas". A vengeance demon hunter is the kind of tank that allows for big pulls and crowd control, but with snapping, literaly any tank can do what they do. And i simply don't get how ppl don't see how snapping is bad for this game moving forward
[1:24:45] flawlesslykun: because ppl abuse tf out of this
[1:25:00] Redivna: can someone explain the rp difference?
[1:25:02] gelth: asking again, is there any key in the current pool where snapping is part of the meta routing in live keys?
[1:25:11] Guffels: bad for the game and bad for mdi can be 2 different things. i think it makes the competition better
[1:25:18] Guffels: tech is fun to watch
[1:25:39] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:25:51] Riicky_tv: alrdy told em
[1:25:53] Riicky_tv: ofc
[1:25:53] Godsban3: 1
[1:25:59] befek: one
[1:26:03] Bledgor: meh if certain streamers didn't stream MDI i wouldnt watch it, great push is infinitely more fun to watch for me, MDI is usually about finding the most allowed biggest abuse
[1:26:05] AlsoZen: wan
[1:26:15] Riicky_tv: best part is during pracc
[1:26:21] Iqqo: @Riicky_tv  when wil u start doing keys again?
[1:26:30] Riicky_tv: when u perma out there fishing when you trynna figure out how fast ppl are in x dungeons
[1:26:45] Redivna: cwassoint?
[1:26:49] Riicky_tv: @Iqqo casual working andy brother

[1:35:27] Surarn: Looked like he was stuck in combat
[1:35:32] Guffels: @Celissah if it enables a +3 where a +2 with a healer is the cap, it could be cool but otherwise its not worth the risk. dont think there needs to be a rule against it
[1:35:43] Surarn: Or perhaps he didnt have flame sigil ready
[1:36:19] Malexand6742: whats the go to healer for M+ nowadays? I havent really played this xpac

[1:41:28] lofibanshee: meanwhile jb is just like, "another day at the office"
[1:41:33] Bledgor: I wonder if they will do a 10 pool dungeon S4 or if they will drop this and just do teh 8 base Dragonflight dungeons
[1:41:50] Celissah: Serbia
[1:41:53] yenny__: german internet is always sus
[1:41:54] flawlesslykun: @gelth im not sure if this is true, but i heard s4 will be all dragonflight dungeons
[1:42:03] Baab83: Servers are in Amsterdam
[1:42:11] caradea_: germany is far behind in terms of fiber
[1:42:14] Webchika: I think there are some servers in France too
[1:42:14] AlsoZen: I've heard some peeps complain about German internet. Not sure
[1:42:19] gelth: @flawlesslykun yeah they didn't say it explicitly but said it kinda vaguely
[1:42:31] gelth: but I'm hoping that means the 8 original, no megadungeon
[1:42:36] Baab83: 6 ms here
[1:43:29] flawlesslykun: i fucking hope that's not the case ngl. i kinda like this way of doing dungeon pools between seasons, considering we only get new dungeons with a new expac (which i think they should make a effort to make it happen during the current expac more often)
[1:43:47] AlsoZen: Chad hair
[1:43:49] Webchika: @gelth I have a feeling that we'll get the Mega dungeon in addition to the original 8

[1:46:21] xXFlow29Xx: Mandatory or Echo Jdot ?
[1:46:25] Surarn: That was odd, it looked like he melded BEFORE the wrath

[1:47:19] delacourtv: If you slow it down, you can see the fast wrath cast into meld immediately after it ends
[1:47:22] Surarn: Dont try it on a dummy
[1:47:28] delacourtv: Like going 0.5x speed
[1:47:30] flawlesslykun: ye i think u have like 1 second before u get in combat jb (before wrath hits your target, and depending how far it is)
[1:47:34] Surarn: Si
[1:47:41] xRakii787: dummy combat is turbo scuffed
[1:47:52] Surarn: Wrath into meld

[1:48:25] Surarn: dummies are dumb
[1:48:35] xXFlow29Xx: go push :)
[1:49:10] pag2: After this MDI could you see them changing thew game so that delayed abilities generate combat when cast not when the damage instance happens
[1:49:11] AlsoZen: jb, what is the lore behind those 3 cds are the top of the screen?
[1:49:26] AlsoZen: as opposed to being in a centralized position

[1:57:38] tight96: necrotic seat lmao
[1:58:03] delacourtv: I'm just waiting for when Echo doesn't ban Throne and everyone just always assumes they will.  So then Echo just comes out with a banger throne
[1:58:08] lofibanshee: We haven't seen an Eclipse AD at all
[1:58:35] lofibanshee: Dawgs is 1-1 at AD
[1:58:57] lofibanshee: LMAO
[1:58:59] flawlesslykun: @tight96 i actualy want to play seat again next season. my ideal dungeon pool is seat, cathedral, eye of azshara, maw of souls, and 4 dragonflight dungeons (if they keep the same format)
[1:59:34] lofibanshee: Shak diff I think.\
[1:59:45] kelly_mac06: if you're talking about season 4, they are doing all DF dungeons @flawlesslykun
[2:00:02] flawlesslykun: yy i said the same thing earlier. was just sharing my "dream" dungeon pool
[2:00:05] lofibanshee: Shak makes it so hard for bad vibes.
[2:00:34] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun id love to go back to seat. Cathedral was a ton of fun as well. It's a shame that both dont have more popularity
[2:01:18] flawlesslykun: @kelly_mac06 agreed. legion dungeons are just so good. But hey, if they keep this format going forward, i'm sure we'll play em again next expac or expacs after
[2:01:19] delacourtv: Mage can even ring if they really want to keep them trapped
[2:01:43] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun honestly i can see them bringing back seat bc of the void connections
[2:01:49] kelly_mac06: that would be pretty fun
[2:01:54] flawlesslykun: YEP
[2:02:17] flawlesslykun: also seat is actualy fun af to play. It is a hard dungeon because of tuning back then, but it is a lot of fun
[2:02:18] tight96: @flawlesslykun did you see the infamous necrotic seat in mdi? The team basically made a key that they knew they couldnt do for the memes. Was Stupid Mistakes vs Parse Culture iirc
[2:02:26] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun agreed
[2:02:28] lofibanshee: It's Dawgs all the way
[2:02:39] lofibanshee: DrJay and Sjele too big of fan favorites
[2:03:27] flawlesslykun: @tight96 i can't even remember that match anymore, but i do recall what you're saying. I still maintain my point tho. seat is a fun dungeon, the affixes and the tuning made it a nightmare tho (which nowadays should be a lot better because a lot of the affixes don't exist anymore)
[2:03:39] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:03:52] tight96: yeah its a fun key, but that was related to teams choosing the keys+affixes
[2:04:00] kelly_mac06: @tight96 was that the one with like 100 deaths before 1st boss
[2:04:09] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood

[2:04:19] flawlesslykun: LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:04:28] flawlesslykun: THAT WAS SO FUCKING FUNNY DUDE
[2:04:30] Celissah: Would have been nice to get a total dps on the meter aswell.
[2:04:39] tight96: they asked the admins if there was a time limit if they couldnt finish the key
[2:04:53] kelly_mac06: lmao legion MDI was really the wild west
