[0:37:45] Renfuryy: Adrenaline causes tiny muscles beneath our skin to contract, tugging at the roots of the hairs that cover our bodies. This is when our hair stands on end and gives us “goosebumps.” Scientists believe that our bodies react to fear and excitement as a means of survival
[0:37:50] gamelifedotcom: Para and sympathetic nervous systems relate.  It's a spike or reaction to the senses

[6:15:44] cosmin284: fuegoYay
[6:15:45] Sev3nL3afKiLLa: its windfury
[6:15:49] stevis87: can you hover over that spell in your buff bar?
[6:15:50] DesiHeat: fuegoYay
[6:15:56] stevis87: looks like a paw from druid spell?
[6:16:07] mandito_: fuegoH
[6:16:32] Vagilante: That's correct because ferals crits were so high and frequent
[6:16:36] Ghouliat: you can mouse over your buff (wildstrikes)
[6:16:36] stevis87: @DesiHeat hover over that buff by minimap
[6:16:41] Vagilante: in original classes
[6:16:43] stevis87: the one with a paw strike
[6:16:47] Vagilante: classic I mean
[6:16:49] stevis87: chance to gain extra attacks
[6:16:49] BooBooKittie: Ok, but the question is, does he hit 3 times just like the party?
[6:16:52] Renfuryy: the short answer is you give your party windfury, and you give yourself windfury
[6:17:11] Ghouliat: It functions exactly like windfury totem at horde
[6:17:11] Fuzzybeard90: woah thats huge. feral NEEDS winfury to be relevant
[6:17:21] cosmin284: BANGER
[6:17:33] nobodygotfarm: 3 hits is WF shaman weapon enchant, not the WF totem
[6:17:38] stevis87: good for your wanding or nah
[6:17:43] stevis87: is wand physical or no
[6:17:44] crystalfev3r: i love y ou

[6:25:32] stevis87: lol at the auto translate
[6:25:46] nctisz: hiii desi!!!!

[6:26:01] NotSydd: @BooBooKittie meta feral is laser cat, dot and run
[6:26:01] DakuiOG: peepoClap
[6:26:04] Elijahss: @NotSydd Yeah, if they sit in bear a lot.  but solo that just means they are dying.

[6:26:35] nctisz: your hair looks amazing too
[6:26:36] stevis87: yeah my precious lol
[6:26:38] Aidstation: Yea I feel like SF just isn't that different from hardcore. They should have done SSF and I think there may have been more interest. The timing is also tough with SOD being so popular at the moment.
[6:26:39] Faithdimmer: I think that a lot of classic players get carried through dungeons and get funneled gear so I will be playing =)
[6:26:46] stevis87: i figured but i did it anyways
[6:26:54] cosmin284: Nessie
[6:27:14] Faithdimmer: yep
[6:27:14] Fossabot: YEP
[6:27:23] Elijahss: @Faithdimmer They can still carry dungeons
[6:27:31] Elijahss: and funnel gear
[6:27:44] Faithdimmer: they can't trade gear
[6:27:54] Renfuryy: they just have to loot it xff
[6:27:59] Elijahss: you run the dungeon over and over and pass on gear
[6:28:02] Aidstation: You can still group in SF
[6:28:07] Fuzzybeard90: I know i didnt get much loot at all from BFD. But holy smokes was i glad it wasnt GDKP
[6:28:15] Elijahss: like we just did
[6:28:37] BooBooKittie: @NotSydd we could trade with entangling roots without popping out of cat form too. its ok, they will fix it, game runs out in a few hours
[6:29:04] Aidstation: just make it where you could only run each once?
[6:29:08] Renfuryy: that would be how youd fix it
[6:29:09] Aidstation: just make it a permanent lockout
[6:29:17] Renfuryy: "boosters" cant boost if they can run the dungeon once
[6:29:26] SHammerdD: https://open.spotify.com/track/2tznHmp70DxMyr2XhWLOW0?si=8f119dd7126e42f5
[6:29:39] Renfuryy: even one a day, or every few days would stop that problem
[6:30:02] Aidstation: Yea and I am less worried about running dungeons, but grouping in the open world makes it way easier
[6:30:30] cosmin284: Vibe
[6:30:36] Renfuryy: kargoz peepoSpace
[6:30:37] mandito_: Vibe
[6:30:43] Renfuryy: where are you now peepoSpace
[6:30:48] Aidstation: With grouping quests like absent minded prospector and such become easy where those are brutal in ssf hardcore.
[6:30:52] Elijahss: The addon was cool, it had achievements and such.  It is still a thing for people that want that.
[6:31:02] mandito_: AlienSlow
[6:31:13] Renfuryy: yes to stop dungeon grinding to lvl

[6:43:27] cosmin284: NODDERS
[6:43:34] Elijahss: yes, I noticed it right away in the early days
[6:43:34] stevis87: A coquette is a flirt, a girl or woman who knows how to flatter and manipulate men with her charms in order to get what she wants. Coquette sounds French, and it is, borrowed into English from French in the mid-17th century.
[6:43:39] DakuiOG: @Aliinaa fuegoHejka

[6:44:46] stevis87: In the mating season, which runs from August to March, the male pursues a female until she pauses. He then displays for her by erecting his crest, flashing his glittering emerald gorget, and fanning the black-and-white “frill” decorating the sides of his throat.
