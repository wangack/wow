[0:35:22] Darri_w: HeyGuys
[0:35:37] tuttifruttipop: yep
[0:35:41] ForgingHammer: Absterge said that it's not even only a kick bot but a new bot too
[0:35:45] 0xaxzy: so if someone makes kickbot kick at end of cast nobody will say youre cheating
[0:35:45] dusttiy: ye but if the guy who makes the bots says hes also sketchy, then something is clearly wrong @Whaazz
[0:35:46] dusttiy: KEKW
[0:35:49] lambpuffx: any clips of this "shady" shit he is doing?
[0:35:50] Rofyx: jaime knocking whaazz 3 yard hook when there's like 0.0001 seconds between the hook and the cheapshot, jaime isn't cheating he's just too good
[0:35:51] jjewee: @matzefyr  u just mad cos u are stuck at 1.5k cr
[0:35:58] Zenlyn: idk its like what jaime says, with all the attention on him he would've been banned by now just my opinion tho
[0:35:59] riccoretaroh: dis gui git ban 4 rmt no ban 4 cheet CoolStoryBob
[0:36:12] Dirtydan007: @Whaazz me and my friends got ahold of that rogue from pika's youtube video. We are convinced after talking to him that hes not cheating
[0:36:17] juanmrbbnero: Content
[0:36:26] lambpuffx: nah but i wanna see it, so where can i find it? not after you showing it
[0:36:28] WagwanBombaClatBomba: the clip where he did the messi movement was sus af
[0:36:33] justacomma: i love how people say they dont want to accuse jaime of anything but everyone rank1 streamer i watch goes on and on about jaime
[0:36:50] rasmus165: @Zenlyn that would require Blizzard to care and take action
[0:36:53] fugll_: @whaazz what is the best tips for someone havent playd outlaw rogue?
[0:37:00] hollow1zed: @Whaazz yo whats the thought behind going for 40% crit on outlaw, when bte gives 20% so you overcap on 120%?
[0:37:06] Zenlyn: i would love if u made a new wow account and didnt stream it, climbed shuffle completely outplayed everyone then ppl would think ur scripting too
[0:37:11] ziloclol: i met a guy in solo shuffle yesterday, everytime i danced he popped something, disarm, ROP etc so i had to test it out and he did it everytime the same global i pressed it pretty much LUL
[0:37:17] smuuchx: the pikaboo clipped looked like pika was more annoyed than anything as the rogue did some lucky plays to me
[0:37:26] smuuchx: and people like to blow things out of proportions
[0:37:38] kevvandh: what are those green boxes on ur tm8s?

[0:40:11] Matzefyr: what's the big deal about using bots in wow? this game is 20 years old and some people enjoy playing the game this way and it doesnt hurt anyone else. I use bots because i find it easier and more fun this way.
[0:40:16] ziloclol: @waitimdesyncd if i had a video of it, you would have seen LUL
[0:40:40] ziloclol: @waitimdesyncd you dont press that so fast if ur not using a program to do it for you.
[0:41:04] waitimdesyncd: @Matzefyr  You are fried my guy, saying WHaazz shouldnt get paid for playing a video game because you have to be up at 6AM to work, and now you say cheating is OK because you dont have time. Cant you just play a singleplayer game if you dont have time to game and feel like you need to cheat
[0:41:14] BaWbEY: just banzt
[0:41:16] waitimdesyncd: @ziloclol  Sry that other dude was frying my brain :D

[0:42:36] Moobot: https://www.instagram.com/oscar_wulff/
[0:42:37] Matzefyr: If you don't already using bots in pvp you just behind on meta. Blizzard dont ban and in few years we will all be playing arena with our ai bots and humans cant compet
[0:42:41] 0xaxzy: and you can obviously configure it to choose when to kick etc
[0:42:51] ziloclol: @Matzefyr lol

[0:43:11] HowDoIBison: @Matzefyr grade A troll trenWicked
[0:43:14] waitimdesyncd: The dude that claimed he talked to the rogue "perfect" that Pika claimed was cheating, can that dude ask how many abilities the rogue has on focus target since the rogue targets another target and still does all abilities on pika
[0:43:26] ziloclol: why the hell i get 2000 ads today dafuq, midgame aswell
[0:43:40] starving8: @Matzefyr You're trolling right? xD
[0:43:52] DaraxBarex: @0xaxzy damn thats sad lol
[0:44:05] haiikilul: What is that green/red square that appears in your raid frame in your teammates?
[0:44:13] 0xaxzy: @DaraxBarex and the one that got waved is already or will be back in a few days
[0:44:27] 0xaxzy: sooo
[0:44:35] DaraxBarex: @0xaxzy i mean ig blizz is fine with that since that means that player has to buy the game, expacs and sub so more money for them sadly

[0:48:25] waitimdesyncd: @0xaxzy  Yeah, but I just wanted to know why he is "convinced", I would be convinced if other top players did a full rotation on the focus target. But We have to stop talking about it now
[0:48:39] damian_blake: @Whaazz How can you fix the shadowmeld between the eyes bug during the game? It's so annoying.

[0:50:44] waitimdesyncd: @0xaxzy  Yeah, but even if he had arena123 it seems really weird to not just target who youre killing instead of doing a WHOLE match rotation with arena123
[0:50:51] lazyturtle0824: @forginghammer he did then was asked for vods and everything deleted
