[1:31:36] triggs390: My gold farm was GDKPs, didnt need to buy gold just run my 5 alts
[1:31:48] ugunskrusts: it requires brain to function, to earn gold :D
[1:31:49] BerCraft_: you dont need too much monet in this game
[1:31:52] body_type_two: KEKW 󠀀
[1:31:54] kayy745: questing the whole day at max level? when i just spent 0-60 doing that?
[1:31:54] triggs390: yes
[1:31:54] bassiemon123: finner2Boomer
[1:31:56] markaimfire_: yes
[1:31:58] MrRobotDude: what
[1:32:00] thesack3: actually thats a good idea, use a second account to buy gold

[1:32:07] mojuuls: facts
[1:32:09] Aumua: how long have you been playing this game
[1:32:10] ugunskrusts: yes, they get lots of gold at 40 level.
[1:32:13] myop: rush is because people have more characters to level
[1:32:13] triggs390: cause you want gold?
[1:32:15] OldManAngelo: how does it not
[1:32:16] jallaballan: yes

[1:32:19] ugunskrusts: same it was at level 25 P1
[1:32:19] freshlife: rat brains, that's how
[1:32:20] markaimfire_: It's easier to farm mats to sell than do that. Don't tell anyone though
[1:32:22] Zackkery: Once max level the gold is doubled for each turn in

[1:32:45] ExamanteD: They give less gold? lol? :D
[1:32:47] R1ch3n: cause you get less gold that way
[1:32:48] rogugor: too much effort
[1:32:50] Zackkery: Because you don't get as much gold in return
[1:32:50] mojuuls: on max lvl more gold for each quest
[1:32:52] triggs390: when youre max level quests give more gold
[1:32:54] OldManAngelo: Clueless
[1:32:57] guni1980: Gold from quest are much higher when lvl caqpped
[1:33:00] petrosgambit: Clueless
[1:33:04] ExamanteD: wow :D actually interesting :D
[1:33:06] bassiemon123: From 25 -> 40 i got 90ish gold. Did have big bags and some luck with drops.
[1:33:07] Eavesdropz93: @Lil_levix auction house method
[1:33:09] waffle977: what is the strongest caster so far?
[1:33:10] Bloodraven2488: quest at 40 ive 2-4g
[1:33:11] jallaballan: you get bonus gold when max lvl
[1:33:11] The_Longcat: dungeons faster, then at lvl 40 faster questing for gold and more gold
[1:33:13] waffle977: and melee
[1:33:15] Bloodraven2488: give*
[1:33:16] satras12: at max lvl the exp is rewarded as gold when completed
[1:33:35] jallaballan: before 40 its like 30 silver, at 40 its 3-4 gold
[1:33:38] in_HighRes: this is why he has no gold
[1:33:39] Zackkery: If said quest gave 86 silver at 39 that same quest at 40 would give like 1g 76 silver or some non sense.
[1:33:43] markaimfire_: Even still farming mats to sell pays out WAY more than questing at any level
[1:33:50] ahhhhitburns: @jallaballan 3-4gold? no its not
[1:33:53] bassiemon123: And next phase ppl going to spam dungeons again. Cuz they dont have quests huha
[1:33:54] epicbluej: when at lvl cap 40, exp reward is turned into gold. So its like 2-3x more gold net
[1:33:57] Lynxlar: rogue, no big numbers?
[1:34:01] Eavesdropz93: @Lil_levix i can't say more my friend Kappa
[1:34:08] ugunskrusts: @thesack3 isnt transaction tracable, if you send this gold elsewhere, it is like money laundering, you receive some random money to your bank account and immediately transfer it to other account, this is when you can receive a call from police.
[1:34:11] ExamanteD: lmao :D
[1:34:18] emsoN: If you dont have atleast 2000g in you bank right now.. What is the point of even playing duh
[1:34:24] rogugor: well you can level up with dungeons which is the fastest and then buy gold
[1:34:28] bskunk: mount tho
[1:34:36] body_type_two: mount
[1:34:41] body_type_two: yess
[1:34:51] captainflarp: you get a massive gold bonus for being level capped from quests 2-3g per quest not 17 silver

[1:35:32] bassiemon123: U could save gold on mount Just spamming stv on ur alts. Little tiger or raptor 1gold coin 5head
[1:35:38] ExamanteD: @Donutbandit of course it is relatively simple. I am not sure why there is a discussion here D:
[1:35:40] Crawstorm: @PsheroTV why are you so poor u dont have faps / thistle tea?
[1:35:41] petrosgambit: you guarantee you get the items you want by spamming the dung, and you get more quest gold from completing the q at higher lvl. Also you will have a mount when doing the quests. It makes more sense in every capacity
[1:35:45] thesack3: @ugunskrusts im thinking buy the goods with the second account and just send the goods rather than the gold its self, they may still be able to trace it, but id expect itd be harder
[1:35:59] SAMO0RA1: idk why ppl risk it ive never been banned
[1:36:07] kayy745: @thesack3 Yea im gonna do that now
[1:36:08] jallaballan: just make a new account and lvl to 40 if u get banned over a week
[1:36:18] rogugor: btw have you had chance to duel any good mages yet?
[1:36:32] bassiemon123: Chat turning into reddit posts

[1:38:52] kayy745: @ugunskrusts I was thinking that too, cant hunters solo dungeons now too ?
[1:39:08] nikator1: did they losed
[1:39:12] ugunskrusts: never played hunt, dont know
[1:39:36] kayy745: just like a mage
[1:39:57] markaimfire_: Gotta be geared. Tried it on my not so geared hunter. Was rough
[1:40:00] ugunskrusts: i meant, with mage you can quickly farm gols with AOE pulls, and then you can sell Portals
[1:40:06] markaimfire_: and pet needs to be trained up

[6:33:41] bassiemon123: How will they even do the tourney, think u'll be allowed to swap runes during fight?
[6:33:52] ballerstatuslol: i kinda get what you're saying but your explanation as to why is wrong. the 10% decreases as fight time goes on. it's 10% for a <=6sec fight, 5% if the fight is 12 seconds, 2.5% if the fight is 24secs, etc.
[6:34:37] nailerak: @bassiemon123 they only invite after you get your AGM Kappa

[6:37:59] Zhilex: yeah so its insane vs meeles/hunters
[6:38:15] ballerstatuslol: if you can do all of your opponents health in under 6seconds, it did 10% of the health of the enemy tho. if someone has 1980 hp and you have 300 dps without it and 330 with it, you would do 1800 dps in 6seconds and he would have 180/1980 ~9% hp left
[6:38:34] Zhilex: in a fight of 20 secs they basically attack you for 18 secs, considering they keep hitting u

[6:39:20] keqe: Waylay so good you still have to crippling poison Kappa
[6:39:20] tecncaldificltes: @ballerstatuslol  1800 dps KEKW
[6:39:33] squirrelwithbignuts: your 10% does not matter at all , my meta wl got over 4k hp in bgs
[6:39:44] ballerstatuslol: unless what you're saying is that 1.1x your damage does not equal fighting an opponent with 90% of it's normal hp, then yes that is correct. 10% more dmg means the target has 1/1.1 = 91% hp compared to without the rune
[6:40:40] Vetto_7: I will try waylay

[6:47:33] akuna551: Can you explain why crippling poison should go on MH or OH , ty
[6:47:36] jallaballan: you also need to stealth and suffer the slow before your able to connect and deal 10% more damage instead of just connecting with full speed and slow instantly
[6:47:45] Zhilex: I mean as in I am using waylay and have the same logic
[6:47:47] nailerak: idk who started it but it was super fun to hear the logic chain out loud
