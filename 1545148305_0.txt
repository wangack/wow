[0:17:52] megamanx9999: I mean I figured that
[0:18:10] megamanx9999: I guess I was thinking because I saw somebody preview mage so I thought maybe mage was on the Beta I guess not

[0:50:14] Nicstar1007: <3
[0:50:14] megamanx9999: Like I was saying I don't know which one I want to play because I only have enough time to play 1 do I play wrath classic or do I play dragonflight

[0:54:49] swampt1l: towShappens towShappens Hello Hammer squad
[0:55:26] officialviz: how much does Avenger shield not gening AP hurt the spec if at all?
[0:55:36] steldam: Sooooooo, its confirmed, AS dont proc HP is working as intended...
[0:55:42] swampt1l: Is Holy spec still not available?
[0:56:01] Molvonos: The single target shield feels like it's more pvp tbh
[0:56:53] megamanx9999: Is that a good thing or bad thing
[0:56:55] megamanx9999: ?
[0:57:05] abracka_: no justice no peace

[0:58:38] Molvonos: @Audoni Its the just waking up voice.
[0:58:42] megamanx9999: I didn't even really play shadowlands and I don't think that's a good idea
[0:58:51] Audoni: Ah
[0:59:18] KydSage: thats a huge change to paladin Sadge
[0:59:29] kingliar: there are many more defensive cooldowns tho
[0:59:32] megamanx9999: Doesn't sound like a good change
[1:00:21] KydSage: @kingliar yeah i get that but like, im not even a pally main but that avengers shield change just *feels* off

[1:01:55] Audoni: It’s a signature ability… like chain heal for shaman
[1:02:03] kingliar: it is but judjement is the main holy power generator for prot anyway. but i haven`t tried how it plays so i honestly can`t say for sure
[1:02:20] Truthseeker96: wtf.. why are they gonna change a core ability for prot pally
[1:02:30] Ramoneko: good morning guys
[1:02:36] kingliar: @Towelliee is blessed hammer the go to talent for hp genration now?
[1:02:42] steldam: You are not gonna like it....
[1:03:35] nekrojiji: why is divine charfger weird on a 1min cd ... DK's wraith walk is slower and at 1 min cd
[1:04:14] ShadoodHD: omg someone get me a beer, this post and talent tree is making me crazy NotLikeThis

[1:07:18] kingliar: but also free glory ia every 3d shield with talent now
[1:07:24] kingliar: not 5th
[1:07:30] Dagomarus: Yeah once the talents actually work the decision to have not generate holy power wont matter as much, but without stuff working not having that power is being felt more than it should be

[1:07:47] Zevn1166: How does as not giving holy power feel? It sounds terrible
[1:08:18] abracka_: "we want sotr to feel more impactful" towStop towIt
[1:08:19] bagboii: @Towelliee What do you think of the Ret talent tree?
[1:08:21] robbo1010: morning morning
[1:08:37] megamanx9999: It always kind of feels like blizzard goes back-and-forth with this I don't know I really just kind of wish blizzard would leave that idea alone just let aurabilities generate holy power and leave it
[1:08:47] kingliar: i guess we must see how much absorbtion avengers shield actually genrates

[1:10:33] wowking35: wowking35 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hi
[1:10:35] Ortinoth: but thats giving blizzard faith and i don't have faith in blizzard in doing correct balance changes
[1:10:39] Zevn1166: I wish they would just let AVengers shield generate
[1:10:40] NinjaChane: it's sucks that most of it is broken, so any data they get now is almost wasted
[1:10:46] ShadoodHD: pally talent tree is like a scuffed up conduit at this point LUL
[1:11:04] megamanx9999: Well one good thing is the fact that they can change it back if they find that holy power generation is low they can always make it so eventual generates it again can't they
[1:11:05] Rudric_Ice: Ret has a consencration build which might be fun to try out
[1:11:26] zastin586: the whole idea of active mitigation is flawed in my opinion
[1:11:32] kingliar: ret seems to have some really col builds
[1:11:37] kingliar: at least
[1:11:38] Dagomarus: Its still being tested though, if when all the talents are working and it still feels weak they will probably give you the holy power back
[1:11:49] br3z: its like a few wet noodles folded against eachother
[1:11:55] Cosmolus: It feels like the person who did these trees doesn't play or understand prot and ret at all

[1:12:25] Hungry_Sultan: even 3-5% dmg reduction better than armor
[1:12:40] UltraContent: @Towelliee  what about the dragon aspects new spells? will them implemented in alpha soon?
[1:12:50] ShadoodHD: i loved that, especially with significant stat increase... all talent trees don't have it don't they?

[1:14:46] baaronthemonk: morning towelliee
[1:14:49] Zevn1166: Avengers shield not generating looks so scuffed. You prio AS in m+ but then you don’t have holy power
[1:15:02] wowking35: @UltraContent \
[1:15:21] foofighters182: why u no holy pally??
[1:15:27] captiv8: I say change SotR flat damage reduction and increase the dmg reduction from standing in your concecration.
[1:15:35] Molvonos: @foofighters182 He's a tank main.
[1:15:35] zastin586: @Towelliee I feel like the whole holy power system gets in the way of their new prot design
[1:15:50] foofighters182: PogChamp
[1:16:30] Zevn1166: @towelliee maybe they make you pick between double judgement and As generating ?
[1:17:12] kingliar: y especially as kyrian
[1:17:16] kingliar: so much holy power
[1:18:10] Morpserie: mornin towelliee, morning chat
[1:18:12] Cosmolus: that is because the tree is bad
[1:18:33] Truthseeker96: your opener is gonna be poopy now
[1:18:33] Cosmolus: the decision at its basis doesn't make sense
[1:18:39] ShadoodHD: wtb hybrid talent trees like the old days Kappa
[1:18:39] IronWishfull: towelliee when they nerf survival should i try marks or bm ?
[1:19:04] YardRage: get high as you can CiGrip
[1:19:05] abracka_: did they ever post the survival hunter nerfs for s4 they talked about?
[1:19:13] rhyswow: preach couldn't find them
[1:19:13] OviTheGray: few of them
[1:19:26] kingliar: on the other hand rets have every talent generating hp
[1:19:32] megamanx9999: Yeah they're kind of trying to do that at least from what I've seen with retro retribution It kind of feels like they're trying to do that too
[1:19:41] captiv8: Well on a positive note sandworn relics are FINALLY becoming BoA
[1:19:43] Zevn1166: @towelliee even if they make you safe with AS not generating/low sotr uptime. It  just seems way less fun. So what’s the point?
[1:19:54] megamanx9999: Hybrid like you can speck yourself to be more aiwi or more single target
[1:19:57] DeanoTV: @captiv8 omg when
[1:19:57] RathianD: All these down sides only for that so Shield of the Righteous feels good to press...
[1:20:00] kw3nk: maybe that just me, but i actually dont want to press SotR/Ironfur/Ignore Pain on cd so I have 100% uptime on the buffs. I'd rather have more passive armor/block etc
[1:20:13] megamanx9999: yep
[1:20:13] captiv8: @deanotv Season 4
[1:20:24] bloodhounde08: I honestly liked cata or mop prot pally the most
[1:20:24] OviTheGray: if you find them in the achievements they kinda tell you the zone they are in
[1:20:26] DeanoTV: took their time god damn
[1:20:28] megamanx9999: I don't know I still kinda stand by the idea I still don't like it even after all these years I just never felt it was good for the class personally
[1:21:17] megamanx9999: See I'm gonna sound like the old school guy here my favorite generation of paladin will always be wrath
[1:21:35] kingliar: yeah just make it percentage reduction
[1:21:44] heavenphist: whats the prot mastery now @Towelliee ?
[1:21:53] Dagomarus: I feel like any tank should not have to worry about resource generation, you should have easily enough resources to choose between damage abilities, utility snd damage reduction, you cant tank properly if you have resource generation issues.
[1:21:55] kw3nk: hm dunno. I play mainly BRM for m+ and pressing purifying brew on cd is just boring
[1:21:58] zastin586: just scrap holy power (atleast for prot) and redesign it around mana, like it used to be
[1:22:16] captiv8: maybe guardian wa correct after all with the insta reset lol
[1:22:55] kingliar: that would be cool

[1:23:01] OviTheGray: in the zone where you go to talk to wrathion, one of the glyps is high, behind the throne building, in the lava
[1:23:14] kingliar: make you actually not missing conc atter more
[1:23:15] Dagomarus: Plus with the talent making conscerate bigger gives you some literal and figuratively …wiggle room
[1:23:40] RathianD: The thing is not only we are loosing defense we also loosing al lots of dps :(
[1:23:41] LeGoogs: So prot aplly first iteration not good?
[1:23:48] Truthseeker96: yea you could stack mastery and have mitigation up all day
[1:23:49] nicedevill: Glider market is going to crash once Dragonflight releases lol
[1:23:50] Zeucean: easy solution:  buff SotR - to be top damage  spell  and then for sure you press it  and it will feel just like doing rotation and  having active mitigation up
[1:24:07] heavenphist: also SotR needs to last longer in that case, so we are not super worried we wasted HP on something else then dont have sotr
[1:24:07] Dagomarus: So you you glide through them to get skill points?
[1:24:09] ShadoodHD: i was thinking about vers too for bulwark of order but i think that won't help lol
[1:24:30] megamanx9999: I mean again I would just think make all the abilities generate holy power again and maybe just buff shield of the righteous so it is so it is a flat damage reduction
[1:24:31] Truthseeker96: @Zeucean that sounds good, fair trade
[1:24:54] heavenphist: bfa model was horrendous
[1:25:04] fosko777: isnt SotR 6s on live and 10s in alpha?
[1:25:12] Truthseeker96: The second you are out of holy power and in a tight pickle you find yourself spamming every def cd
[1:25:20] ManlioJorgeGrimaldi: cavern4Rifletti cavern4Strunzooo
[1:25:25] megamanx9999: And see that feels so bad as a paladin because that's one of the cool things of a palliden is to be a utility tank
[1:25:30] Zevn1166: Does anyone else feel like we had to have this exact conversation with blizzard about judgement generating for prot during shadowlands beta.
[1:25:48] OviTheGray: once you take the glyph and get the achievement, in the achievements it kinda tells you whre the rest are
[1:25:51] Truthseeker96: am i suppose to stop dps for 2 secs hit war stomp and heal with flash of the light or what
[1:25:52] Dagomarus: Yeah it kinda goes back to when blood dks used to get rune blocked and couldnt do anything, worst feeling ever
[1:25:52] megamanx9999: yep
[1:25:54] Truthseeker96: cuz that sounds wack
[1:25:55] DeanoTV: KEKW
[1:26:35] JuveGG: What RIO we need in Season 4 for new Conduits?
[1:26:38] OviTheGray: yes
[1:26:48] Dagomarus: Cant wait for the map add-on with all the skill points on it LUL
[1:26:49] Molvonos: @JuveGG You dont
[1:26:59] subversv: 278 conduits for all!
[1:27:02] Wolfenhoof: Isn't there a handynote for it yet? Kappa
[1:27:06] binkz77: u don't need it for conduits in s4
[1:27:11] Dagomarus: there isnt new conduits though?
[1:27:15] JuveGG: but i have a char i want to reroll, and i cant get 3k on that before s4
[1:27:16] swampt1l: Did they show the holy spec for Pally,
[1:27:19] binkz77: no
[1:27:50] Molvonos: @JuveGG Like it was said.  You don't need any IO score.  Will cost flux
[1:27:57] OviTheGray: hover over the flight master icon
[1:28:10] binkz77: 278 conduits in season 4 cost Flux for any toon
[1:28:12] Dagomarus: Can you show the skill tree for dragon riding?
[1:28:23] Akermay: Do these unlock cosmetics or skills?
[1:28:36] JuveGG: ahhh! Tnx guys!
[1:28:44] abracka_: @Akermay yes, and according to them it'll be account bound
[1:28:50] jimmywatki: says either near or atop which is helpful
[1:29:58] Dagomarus: They could do with making them easier to see
[1:30:06] Cicvara1: how expensive was that grass that you got for your backyard? @Towelliee
[1:30:06] Dagomarus: Looks like a star LUL
[1:30:14] Akermay: Question is, can they all be gotten with base skill or do they need to be done as you unlock skill?
[1:30:15] swampt1l: You no longer need 3k rating? @binkz77
[1:30:28] Deadelus0: These were account wide right?

[1:30:30] Kisswani: @Towelliee is it my imagination or does dragon riding seem slower in this build ?
[1:30:38] subversv: zeuussss_ nope :)
[1:31:11] swampt1l: Oh nice that’s pretty awesome @subversv
[1:31:18] nvnto: whats the normal reg rate, if 25s per vigor is improved?
[1:31:22] foghagymatyi: hpw do you get talent points for riding?
[1:31:33] DeanoTV: u think we get beta before September?
[1:31:36] Dagomarus: When your glowing blue when flying is thrill of the skies i think
[1:31:55] Ortinoth: probally october
[1:32:28] Gutroan: Do you think it will be ready for december?
[1:32:44] captiv8: So maybe end of November release then?
[1:32:47] silodin: So one more month to survive... then panda will get me a beta key
[1:33:00] Thoreya: nov 21 is my prediction for DF
[1:33:00] Ortinoth: @Gutroan i think they are rushing it still
[1:33:00] R2RHIN0: I hope they extend or bring back the xp buff before Dragonflight. Having so much fun leveling all my alts
[1:33:08] swampt1l: Panda has all the keys
[1:33:12] lalelusa: this new iteration of jump puzzles seems more fun :)
[1:33:18] Xender21: lot of talents to come with it tho, expect the default to be weak for growth room
[1:33:44] Ghoultv93: nice!
[1:33:58] Kisswani: KEKW
[1:34:06] lalelusa: hearthstone
[1:34:17] Akermay: Actually can’t wait to do this, looks great
[1:34:19] Ortinoth: BUG REPORT !!!
[1:34:29] Xender21: your other east
[1:34:33] Machine42593: south west there
[1:34:50] Dagomarus: Do the races around the isles give skill points, that would be a pretty nice reward for doing them Imo
[1:35:37] BarthelemeusNL: is this account wide that you are doing?
[1:36:20] nickelodeann: !alpha
[1:36:20] Moobot: @nickelodeann ALPHA PHASE 3 TODAY - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Waking Shores (60-63) - Maybe New Dungeon/Class Talents? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[1:36:27] Akermay: Races for cosmetics maybe
[1:36:37] Senile_Preacher: @Hegnar you think blizzard would do something cool like that LUL
[1:36:49] Kisswani: hopefully no time needed to "research " the upgrades , I expect there to be tho
[1:36:53] DeanoTV: they said dragon riding would be account wide
[1:37:00] DeanoTV: so guessing the talents for it
[1:37:03] Dagomarus: Dragon riding progression is account wide yes
[1:37:05] Rudric_Ice: okay they changed the dragon running animation finally it wobbled so much
[1:37:13] NEMERL: @Towelliee u can turn if off
[1:37:17] drewetling: i feel im going to bounce off walls
[1:37:17] Senile_Preacher: oh, damn that is cool LUL
[1:37:23] BarthelemeusNL: i was scarred that maby only the cosmetics would be
[1:37:23] lalelusa: will be interesting to find out if this will trigger my motion sickness or not
[1:37:39] ShadoodHD: oh god they put the steering in dragonriding KEKW
[1:37:46] BarthelemeusNL: i tought i saw something on the highest pillar whenm you flew in
[1:38:00] dwolters_the_zombieman: @towelliee hi and hi chat
[1:38:00] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[1:38:02] Kisswani: Handy notes will figure it out Kappa
[1:38:21] Skizzurp: how deep is the water could it be underwater?
[1:38:23] Dagomarus: Well it definately would suck to have to do this tour of the isles getting all the skill points for all characters would suck ass, so im happy its account wide
[1:38:40] zastin586: I have a feeling it will be on that huge hill to the east
[1:38:44] Rudric_Ice: Mr tow can you check the green dragon running animation ? i wanna see if they fixed it or not
[1:38:45] Wolfenhoof: Hopefully Dragonflying won't be Torghast 2.0 I remember how everyone praised the fun they had in torghast during the alpha and at release it was a pile of annoying shit.
[1:38:46] lalelusa: water dragon incoming
[1:38:48] Ortinoth: they wont put it in water tops of buildings most likely
[1:38:51] doomdrake13: @Towelliee a cave or arch you have to fly through?
[1:38:56] silodin: Ok so ysera and alexstrasza are sisters, right? a green and a red proto drake at some point. now red dragon alexstrasza only lays red dragon eggs. does this mean their mom was a ho?
[1:39:04] Dagomarus: It most definately would be somewhere you can fly through thats difficult and skillful
[1:39:17] Kisswani: @silodin danHuh ?
[1:39:23] Skizzurp: u are not in life pools anymore
[1:39:33] Skizzurp: minimap changed to waking shores
[1:39:37] Niksen_99: Will you still be using ElvUI in Dragonflight? :D
[1:39:38] DeanoTV: yea they said progress
[1:39:43] CloudPants8081: genghi8Jimmy looks cool
[1:39:49] Ortinoth: it should for alts count but have to have it on 1 first i would think
[1:39:51] Blvdman: it better be account wide, no one wants to repeat such a long expansion wide progress grind
[1:39:53] falldrgn: Damn no beta, billy  and no alpha andy :(
[1:40:04] Rudric_Ice: what we doing here ?
[1:40:27] NEMERL: @Towelliee u can turn off FOV camera during Dragonriding
[1:40:30] Molvonos: @falldrgn Beta's not even out yet?
[1:40:34] BarthelemeusNL: when you flew to this erea i saw a glims of the circle on the highest pillar then on your left
[1:40:36] lalelusa: can the points be inside dungeons?
[1:40:45] falldrgn: @falldrgn for WOTLK
[1:40:47] jimmywatki: I find blizzard generally like under bridges if any about
[1:40:50] kaijoe_: Love the map
[1:40:56] CloudPants8081: atpCap
[1:41:06] Voidheim: ElvUI is definitely my go to UI
[1:41:06] Blvdman: THATS CAP
[1:41:17] DeanoTV: i got rid of elvui, just gonna use dominos for frames
[1:41:22] nickelodeann: Elvui is just too clean and helpful
[1:41:25] BoezIRL: what if they buy elvui?
[1:41:27] darkforge__: isx
[1:41:29] DeanoTV: i mean shadowed unit frames not dominos
[1:41:31] Blvdman: Calling my dad rn who works at blizz to remove all addons KappaCool
[1:41:33] Rudric_Ice: if u use domino for UI you can cut that off your list now
[1:41:40] radkkos: not true, rofl
[1:41:50] captiv8: I disagree

[1:42:04] tuttalama12: sick
[1:42:08] Kisswani: I'm probably gonna let ElvUI go , sticking to WAs tho , but I think the bars are ok in the new default UI
[1:42:13] Wolfenhoof: Are there really still only 5 actionbars?
[1:42:14] Rabiahtaro132: Maybe it under a bridge?
[1:42:15] Skizzurp: u are in lifeshrine here so prob not here
[1:42:25] nibenwen: there was a glyph along the flight path in a broken tower or something, remember from yesterday but not 100% sure where exactly
[1:42:27] BarthelemeusNL: on the other side on the highest pillar i saw something
[1:42:30] sliproach: @Blvdman do it can tell RTWF would acturlly be good
[1:42:35] DeanoTV: @Kisswani thats what im doing, keeping normal bars but SUF for frames
[1:42:38] jimmywatki: you die if you hit the bottom
[1:42:55] Jewishraver: the fact elvui allows me to make the bars show up on mouse over instead of all the time is the reason i wont stop using it alone. im a addon user that likes to hide the addons and show more screen :D
[1:42:56] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[1:43:03] wakeandbacon95: this place is rly nice
[1:43:18] Lostdogal: is it possible to move buffs and debuts next to your character, sort of weak aura style or no?
[1:43:27] holtrop: Would be cool if you could dragonride up there yourself
[1:43:43] Coriollis: idk if its lag or just phasing textures
[1:43:50] zastin586: try the mountain to the east
[1:43:53] BarthelemeusNL: you only looked on the left side of the pool i saw something on the right side
[1:44:35] PadidinJones: @Towelliee how do you feel dragon flying is? Easy for plebs?
[1:44:46] Rudric_Ice: u mean animation ?
[1:44:50] Molvonos: Is it possible the change feels different because of the dragon model used? @Towelliee
[1:45:15] Blvdman: I can already see them expanding the amount of jumps you get 3 seems pretty small
[1:45:16] NBK_Sethus: they should really consider implementing dragon riding racing. players go 1 on 1 and bet gold against each other through an NPC that takes say 10-20% tax as a gold sink, it would become a whole new minigame within WoW.
[1:45:29] ShadoodHD: would you say it's a change to... how to train your dragon? Kappa
[1:45:32] hakaeltn: some say dragonflight zones look very much like Turkey, what do you think Towelliee
[1:45:39] sliproach: @PadidinJones as long as you can still hit num lock fly from a  to b it'll be ok
[1:45:39] Molvonos: Ahhh
[1:45:47] Coriollis: @Blvdman down the patch line I think they will add more
[1:45:55] binkz77: handy ones will mark them in map lol

[1:46:20] KaisenSiru: Alpha Pog
[1:46:39] magakigr: does it play better now than the previous build with the "weighted" turning and stuff for the dragon riding?
[1:46:52] KydSage: aether currents NODDERS
[1:46:54] Q_TheDreamer: aether currents?
[1:47:05] Rudric_Ice: can you get on the green dragon i wanna if see if they changed the wobbling when its running ?
[1:47:14] Kisswani: yeah but the currents are just spread around , they are not particularly hard to reach or find
[1:47:40] Akermay: You think it’s a camera issue or the actual movement?
[1:47:43] lalelusa: there'll three typrs of people: those collecting point right awy, those colecting points once flying is unlocked and those who just can't be bothered
[1:48:16] Ortinoth: flying is unlocked  at the start
[1:48:19] sliproach: @lalelusa sign me up for cat B
[1:48:23] Molvonos: I'll be collecting all the points right out the gate, lol
[1:48:37] ShadoodHD: true but you did need to have a bit of awareness to get it :p
[1:48:42] Kisswani: are these the only way to gin skill points ? or maybe an emissary style daily will help with that ?
[1:49:01] Kisswani: POGGERS
[1:49:15] magakigr: imagine if they integrate dragon riding for a raid encounter
[1:49:20] Ortinoth: I'll probably  do the points as I do the zone
[1:49:32] atowellthatiallreadyused: is there alot world content in dragonflight ?
[1:49:57] Akermay: Reckon this will get a lot harder later on? Seems like at current difficulty you could max it in a day
[1:50:00] Rudric_Ice: did they add strafing to the dragons when moving left and right ?
[1:50:07] atowellthatiallreadyused: ohhhhh nice
[1:50:27] falldrgn: so like old school rep grinds, but with more content.
[1:50:32] Kisswani: can you progress simultaneously through all the zones ?

[1:50:43] atowellthatiallreadyused: because they need to fill stuff out since zones is so big :D
[1:50:55] lalelusa: the zones have a pre determined leveling path though. waking shores is like the first or second zone we enter?
[1:51:06] Akermay: Fair
[1:51:24] Kisswani: @lalelusa yeah they said for your first character yeah , alts are free to go wherever
[1:51:32] Fluisterwoud: Handynotes ftw

[1:51:51] lalelusa: @Kisswani great! so a bit of alt friendliness :)
[1:51:51] smol_gunner: ngl, the amount of content creators that are trying to sell Dragonriding as if its the 2nd coming of bby Jesus is insane, its flying with extra steps...
[1:51:52] atowellthatiallreadyused: are you worried they cant fill up the zones enough with content or do you think that wont be an issue ?
[1:52:12] zastin586: maybe try reloading UI ?

[2:12:12] manmower: it'll be good for the DPS as well, paladin will stop moving so much
[2:12:24] Sollice: Good morning friends
[2:12:45] MoNkEy_K1ng: Ooooh.. Prot pallys keep divine toll? :D
[2:12:48] Match_play: with the changes to AS do you think that it takes away from its spec identity like it becomes a filler in ST rather than a builder
[2:13:11] kingkind: @towelliee how does pala feel?  im currently rly disappointed of mage state
[2:13:28] Coriollis: body 1 , body 2 that means Alex is body 2 now Kappa
[2:14:39] elrawin: An expac about the dragons being an equal race and it allows you to own an unpaid dragon to use how you like? Seems sus to me blizz

[2:15:05] Rudric_Ice: wish the wings had some customization
[2:15:22] Molvonos: Onlyfans-adin
[2:15:44] ShadoodHD: meanwhile ret pally has talents with a lot of holy power generation @.@
[2:16:01] Koosalakoopakoop: I hope Bobby Kotick has a wonderful, bright and sunny morning and some delicious coffee :) <3
[2:16:12] Match_play: Its just gonna feel awful to press in DF with it not generating HP. why would you press it in raid over say judgment which is gonna help
[2:16:56] HyirGaming: HyirGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 121 months! Loving the content Rob. Have been watching since 2010 and no plans to stop.
[2:16:57] Balkep: just an interrupt if the silence comes back LUL
[2:17:10] chubahi: i feel like that avenger shield must generate holy power...
[2:17:24] PokerFaceMoose: towHAMUP
[2:17:25] Match_play: I almost wonder if a talent that made AS gen HP would be good but too good, if that makes sense
[2:17:26] Coriollis: idk eye of tyr seems to good to pass but I'm not a prot pala so idk
[2:17:54] 91Niki: Good morning towSip
[2:18:03] soge131: They want SoR uptime down
[2:18:07] HyirGaming: That would be weird. It is such an iconic ability
[2:18:14] TweakT: how many dragones are there in teh gayme
[2:18:19] kingkind: Honestly most talent trees seem like a lazy design
[2:18:33] ShadoodHD: if they want that they should increase its damage and add mitigation to it Madge
[2:19:07] TweakT: I ran outta crack Madge (snus)
[2:19:12] PhantomX_Destiny: How long is the EXP Boost still up for? (Retail)
[2:19:36] nvnto: Heard a lot of people not being fans of DT without Ringing Clarity and HP generation.
[2:19:38] zastin586: @PhantomX_Destiny supposed to go away this next reset
[2:19:52] chubahi: is the prot pallys holy power generation slow now? heard that atm pally is not looking great
[2:19:55] xReadyAimMissx: morning Towelliee and chat burkeWave towSip
[2:20:08] KartariustheFrostMage: @Towelliee What is your perspective on the role of a prot. paladin? Is it good that they are getting more defensive options, or should prot. pallies be focused on doing damage over everything?
[2:20:11] Voidheim: yeah, that's my guess too.
[2:20:22] PhantomX_Destiny: @zastin586 when is the reset?
[2:20:41] Rudric_Ice: thats some weirdchamp change
[2:20:46] zastin586: @PhantomX_Destiny depends on where you playe, Tuesday for NA, Wednesday for EU
[2:20:47] manmower: meaningful choice
[2:20:56] Coriollis: I hope they change Faiyh's Armor or move it lower on the tree , thats a meh talent xD
[2:21:03] PhantomX_Destiny: @zastin586 ok thanks
[2:21:16] Gargkill: if you hit 5 targets it gives 5 right?
[2:21:21] ShadoodHD: OR... use that extra holy power from improve divine toll to mitigation towTinfoil
[2:21:24] heavenphist: depends on target count
[2:21:25] coversRbetter: wait, so avenger shield is actually suppsed to not grant holy power and its not just a bug
[2:21:31] soge131: 1 per target hit
[2:22:08] Coriollis: guess we'll have to wait for them to refine the trees
[2:22:14] Sollice: @coversRbetter Correct
[2:22:19] agnarz: 2%? KEKW
[2:22:28] Coriollis: protector is hella strong
[2:22:32] Aquadriel: 2% has to be a typo
[2:22:34] Skizzurp: max reported some stuff saying it needs to be % based instead of a flat amount so it scales with xpack it seems like thats jsut something blizz needs to adopt as a standard across all specs
[2:22:44] MrFuzzynuts420: who the hell designed the prot talents? KEKW
[2:22:45] nvnto: DT without it hitting the main target multiple times is only gonna be useful in AoE, even if they add HP generation back to it.
[2:22:48] ShadoodHD: best they can do ( KEKW ) is 10% give or take
[2:23:02] ArchivistOwl: Isn't Final Stand a bit broken lul
[2:23:12] nvnto: Unless they give it a flat "generates X HP"
[2:23:29] Coriollis: aoe bubble taunt is prty good
[2:23:29] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[2:23:33] jonnydepth72: How many points will you have at level 70
[2:23:39] ArchivistOwl: Huge pulls in m+, pop DS and aoe
[2:24:07] temp3st98: Talents in df is like how it is in sl they just put talents like whatever
[2:24:46] Rudric_Ice: frost mages can have now 30 Icicles according to the tooltip
[2:25:05] MrFuzzynuts420: is blizz still keeps necrotic in M+ then final stand will probably be mandatory again during those weeks it seems
[2:25:47] heavenphist: if they wanna reduce our HP regen, just make judgment or CS not generate it instead of AS man
[2:26:01] Coriollis: they should get ret aura of sac back but thats another story
[2:26:04] ArchivistOwl: Dungeons with a lot of small annoying adds will ust get steamrolled
[2:26:46] manmower: that's what other classes do right now
[2:27:28] Skizzurp: have they hinted at any meaningful choice covenant type system yet?
[2:27:50] manmower: @Skizzurp talents
[2:28:09] Aquadriel: isnt that basically divine purpose? using a spender makes spenders free @Towelliee
[2:28:26] OviTheGray: Sabellian .. hell yea
[2:28:35] OviTheGray: from outland
[2:28:38] loragheta: his brother lol
[2:28:55] Molvonos: I think that's his uncle, actually
[2:29:00] lalelusa: black dragons popping up all over the place
[2:29:05] OviTheGray: brother
[2:29:09] Coriollis: would u play a prot pally  something like this: the more holy power u have the more effective your deffensive spenders are and u could choose for instance a 2 spender defensive to spend equal or more h power which it makes stronger by a number based %
[2:29:10] kimmo_gaming: its Sabellian, from Balde's edge
[2:29:22] TheCliffyShow: His uncle/brother. They are some hillbilly dragons.
[2:29:40] loragheta: same dad = brother so
[2:29:42] 91Niki: Oof
[2:29:42] lalelusa: emotional demage!
[2:29:47] heavenphist: think you are referring to necro ablity for prot on retail @Towelliee ?
[2:29:52] Aquadriel: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
[2:29:58] mulao5757: lol
[2:29:58] TheIndonimus: !alpha

[2:30:00] Deadelus0: LUL
[2:30:01] thebakeriscomingforu: hmm, are black dragons like gorons from zelda now? lol
[2:30:02] MrFuzzynuts420: KEKW
[2:30:04] Cosmolus: Clap his ass Wrathion
[2:30:12] Miertez: Sabellian is not wrong tho
[2:30:21] manmower: is Wrathion the younger brother?
[2:30:29] OviTheGray: yes
[2:30:41] loragheta: considering he is an angsty teenager basically, yes.
[2:30:48] TheCliffyShow: Wouldn't Hulk Hogan be more of a bronze dragon considering how much he tans, and how he likes to change history to make himself look better.
[2:30:57] loragheta: sabel was in TBC, long before wrathion was born.
[2:31:18] Molvonos: waaaay before.
[2:31:21] lalelusa: ebyssian is probably the oldest
[2:31:21] Aquadriel: we met him in tbc
[2:31:25] instant_savage: @Towelliee did u make a video on ur thoughts on the paladin talnets
[2:31:27] loragheta: we fucked shit up with him in blade edge mountains
[2:31:29] Molvonos: Wore that recolored warlock Nemesis set in Blade's Edge
[2:31:33] Coriollis: oh yeah is the guy from Blade's Edge
[2:31:38] zastin586: Wrathion was "created" in Cata, we met Sybellion in TBC

[2:32:59] TheCliffyShow: Yet, no one asked, "Hey, Ebonhorn! Why haven't you aged in the last couple thousand years?" Damn, typos. Just woke up.
[2:33:13] Xtops: Can someone tell me how much "DF" limits one and how long COMPARED TO "buy Xpac flight" and take off. ^^dissregarding fun factor of the new mechanic"
[2:33:46] pavepawns: damn that armor
[2:33:46] Kisswani: goddamn
[2:33:47] pavepawns: i want it
[2:33:53] loragheta: the black dragons making a comeback
[2:33:58] loragheta: just missing ebonhorn rn
[2:34:00] maccaruso: Sabellian got a big time glow up
[2:34:03] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[2:34:09] NEMERL: This Sibellian look awesome
[2:34:11] looney199725: wrathion better evolve at end of this expac to be his aspect dragon form
[2:34:12] Streamcrush: I don't trust Sabellian
[2:34:13] giggachadwar: An ilusionnnnnnnn
[2:34:17] Coriollis: I want my dragon to have SMOrc visage for horde, is it too much to ask Blizz
[2:34:21] manmower: it's a trap!
[2:34:26] Chiraakitteh: think of dragon riding as a replacement for regular ground mounts
[2:34:33] manmower: Suramar 2.0
[2:34:35] Kisswani: zug zug
[2:34:35] Mezerian: oh no, desuwing being a baddie?!
[2:34:38] elrawin: It’s actually another plot orchestrated by the Jailer
[2:34:39] TheCliffyShow: All the male black dragons seem to take black visage forms. Taking that Power Rangers route.
[2:34:47] cinamonjackz: did you watch any of max's interviews going over the paladin talents?
[2:34:48] Voidheim: Magic man
[2:34:50] Chiraakitteh: as usual, we wouldnt be able to fly in a new expansion right away anyway
[2:35:00] ShadowRuff: daddy bad
[2:35:10] PadidinJones: Aaaah my oath is broken!
[2:35:11] Voidheim: yup
[2:35:12] Sollice: yES
[2:35:12] loragheta: deathwing did some fucked up shit yo
[2:35:20] DudeTheMoose: the seeds of the past bare fruit in the future
[2:35:21] Coriollis: yes and rebuild their flight
[2:35:23] Kisswani: Deathwing and Azshara fucked everything up
[2:35:24] manmower: that's the story arc of real life
[2:35:29] MrFuzzynuts420: aschually!...wasn't it technically the Jailer and not deathwing? LUL
[2:35:29] cobwebhotdog: We haven't gone back to Azeroth since Cata- its not going to fix itself lol
[2:35:31] Keirmot: Well, we're all still living with the consequences of Napolean. Deathwing was just 10 years ago.
[2:35:32] Senile_Preacher: deathwing did nothing wrong
[2:35:40] mavericks312: tbf we haven't seen them aspects since deathwing
[2:35:41] Sollice: @MrFuzzynuts420 It was ALL the jailer
[2:35:42] Nightz101: look at it now respect it
[2:35:42] Trombol97: rebranding
[2:35:42] pavepawns: thats easy
[2:35:42] elrawin: Dude was called Deathwing, did anyone expect him to not be evil, come on now
[2:35:42] LiveFromStua: Will I help them? No LULW
[2:35:42] manmower: the draenei
[2:35:44] pavepawns: nozdormu
[2:35:45] OviTheGray: Ebonhorn :)
[2:35:45] TheCliffyShow: Been dead for a decade and still dealing with his shit.
[2:35:47] warrenny: Plus the dragon isles hid around when deathwing betrayed everyony
[2:35:48] ShadowRuff: sabillian
[2:35:48] looney199725: isnt the story also tied to galakronds generals
[2:35:50] BadHassAvocado: Black Dragonflight: "I will never financially recover from this" (this being what Deathwing did)
[2:35:51] ShadowRuff: or ebon horn
[2:35:54] loragheta: ebonhorn or sabellian is my guess
[2:35:55] Balkep: no, it's me :)
[2:35:56] pavepawns: nozdormu is gonna go nutty
[2:36:00] looney199725: the primals were galakronds army pretty much
[2:36:01] Coriollis: but what if they get corrupted by the light LUL
[2:36:01] Voidheim: nah man, don't do Ebonhorn like that
[2:36:04] NickLeonhearth: cant wait for them to kill Alextraza
[2:36:07] LiveFromStua: @MrFuzzynuts420 NotLikeThis
[2:36:12] TheCliffyShow: Better not be Ebonhorn.
[2:36:13] manmower: has anyone suggested to the Black Dragon flight that they just change their name?
[2:36:18] cinamonjackz: wrathion wasnt corrupted by him., nzoth just showed us a vision making us believe he corrupted him
[2:36:25] Voidheim: @NickLeonhearth you a sick mfer
[2:36:32] Sollice: @manmower To what? The Pink Flyee Boiz?
[2:36:35] mavericks312: @nickleonhearth nah she got that goku plot armor
[2:36:35] TheCliffyShow: @manmower The Dark Grey Dragonflight.
[2:36:41] OviTheGray: what if wrathion gets corrupted and sabellian sacrifices himself to save his little brother
[2:36:53] NickLeonhearth: new model...not my Alextraza !
[2:36:57] ShadowRuff: can we rename the scale commander to the scalycommander
[2:37:04] Sollice: Needed THIC HoTS Alex
[2:37:12] TheCliffyShow: @NickLeonhearth She got fruit bowled.
[2:37:30] NickLeonhearth: @TheCliffyShow true :(
[2:37:33] Streamcrush: Wrathion is a plans within plans kind of guy, my bet is Sabellian and his Outland dragons aren't free from corruption
[2:37:45] elrawin: Guys can I ask a spoiler question for someone who’s been out of the game for a hot minute… is Sylvanas finally dead and are we finally able to move on from her causing all the problems
[2:37:50] megamanx9999: So how does protection palate and feel overall from what you guys are saying it kind of feels a little bit weak
[2:38:00] looney199725: sylvanas wont ever die
[2:38:02] Darthyrevan: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:38:02] looney199725: stop the copium
[2:38:04] Coriollis: my only issue with new Alex human model is that they gave her big anime eyes, they look just too big xD
[2:38:05] NinjaChane: It's kinda weird how high up sentinel is in the tree too. Maybe should be lower.
[2:38:20] ArcaneSyntax: @elrawin she's not dead, she gets to spend eternity in super hell
[2:38:21] looney199725: ion has a doll of sylvanas he keeps in his bed she aint dying
[2:38:22] TheCliffyShow: Ebonhorn would be a weird choice to go evil since he's one of the few completely uncorrupted black dragons.
[2:38:37] MrFuzzynuts420: i can't wait to see what kind of broken specs happen in DF. anyone remember sub rogues 2 shotting everything the first week of shadowlands? LUL

[2:39:23] pavepawns: big spider
[2:39:44] Sollice: That's the other problem with the jailer and shit now....Who knows what kind of dumb story thing they may blame on the jailer. I hope not . I hope it's over

[2:40:11] elrawin: Also I just realised the main character in Mythic Quest tv show is called Ian but its pronounced Ion, I guess hes inspired by WoW’s Ion haha
[2:40:16] lalelusa: we're still missing one paladin spec, DH, warlock, monk and warrior, right?
[2:40:17] heavenphist: why they chose AS though? why not judgemetn or crusader strike stops generating HP?
[2:40:19] banishtyrion: i've been away from some time, is divine hammer not a thing anymore?
[2:40:24] CloudPants8081: genghi8Jimmy

[2:40:56] Coriollis: maybe it scales hp ?
[2:40:56] manmower: scales up with number of players?
[2:41:01] TheCliffyShow: @looney199725 If she ever dies, I'm unsubbing. They have done enough to my WoW waifu. Luckily, she's in the same league as Thrall and Jaina. Sacred Warcraft 3 characters.
[2:41:04] tumb_tack: Mag tower.. but its all spiders

[3:00:25] Strouss: Anyone else notice Overwolf App Sucking resources?
[3:00:29] slackstacker: i feel like trainers ane prof suppliers are just filler npcs for blizzard. so theres not just furniture and 3 questgivers
[3:00:29] LCS01: @Towelliee which level evoker will start?
[3:00:37] Dagomarus: Well its the first zone, you would hope to learn professions in the first leveling zone at least kinda like the first village in pandaria
[3:00:39] MrFuzzynuts420: Does anyone know if the ilvl increases come next week with S4 or is that another 2 weeks after?
[3:00:40] generalmarcus35: I love that the black dragon flight is really coming back
[3:00:51] pavepawns: oooh fancy
[3:00:53] TheCliffyShow: @manmower I don't see Wrathion going evil. I see him doing something stupid that causes a big mess, and having a learning experience that makes him a better person...dragon.
[3:01:26] manmower: @TheCliffyShow so which of our named NPCs is gonna turn evil?
[3:01:29] pavepawns: maybe u gotta stand at a specific spot cause its got a bugged area

[3:02:19] caulpnrydc: caulpnrydc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[3:02:19] OviTheGray: they said that crafting tables are in Valdrakken, maybe u have to use the forge there
[3:02:22] looney199725: chromagus about to slap them all around or they have finally brought galakrond back from death
[3:02:23] slackstacker: i hope we get the most extra flashiest npc turns evil Kappa
[3:02:23] manmower: Blizzard always has someone turn evil, that's their thing
[3:02:36] xFeaver: you only see that if you aren't subbed to the game but have game time.
[3:02:48] ashnmsr: @xFeaver Ohhh i didn't know that :D
[3:02:50] Kale_Nd: you don't see how much time if you have if you are subscribed, you only see it if you have game time but not subbed
[3:03:01] ashnmsr: @Kale_Nd yeah figured^^
[3:03:09] Deadelus0: Doesn't it mean the anvil on the left?
[3:03:15] Coriollis: maybe u need to finish zone to make it active
[3:03:17] silodin: That forge seems like it isn't realy blazing
[3:03:22] looney199725: @Towelliee maybe you have to join the coven first
[3:03:25] ashnmsr: Like when i get wow token it says how long time i have left
[3:03:31] Deadelus0: hmm :-/
[3:03:31] silodin: oh now it seems active
[3:03:50] Quojin: dont activate the forge
[3:03:54] manmower: might not be implemented
[3:03:56] Quakezilla69: Quakezilla69 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:03:59] OviTheGray: maybe you have to finish the quest line first
[3:04:18] dwolters_the_zombieman: I wonder if you have to do the whole quest line before you can use it
[3:04:35] looney199725: it could be coven locked too
[3:04:38] looney199725: lmao

[3:04:55] mewkittymon: Don’t feget to get the jcing kit to make jams etc
[3:04:57] manmower: it said there was a whole cutscene about restoring it, would be odd for it to not be active
[3:05:07] Dagomarus: Did you get all the skill points in this zone?
[3:05:20] CloudPants8081: blizzard done with pvp? Kappa
[3:05:21] Coriollis: maybe after u finish the zone the red npc's dissapear and forge becomes active
[3:05:31] Quikbeard: Champion!!

[3:07:21] imnotperplu: Hey, is Holy Paladin out on alpha?
[3:07:23] OviTheGray: wrathion doesnt want the player to do all the work... like we did for him all the time?
[3:07:26] warrenny: The new one is surely a raid boss

[3:08:43] TheCliffyShow: Ebonhorn needs to go talk to these two. "Y'all need to stop your bitching, or I'll shove my antlers up both your asses."
[3:08:44] Lexxania: not the innocent dragon eggs!!
[3:08:44] paragon_3: Did Wrathion stage the fly-by?

[3:14:55] TheCliffyShow: Captain Exposition will be the one to turn evil.
[3:14:55] ZeusDNA: It'd be kinda cool if you had to choose which one leads the black flight and Blizzard tracks what the community picks and makes that canon in later patches

[3:16:21] TheCliffyShow: At least, keep the monkeys.
[3:16:26] Lundrai: Just change testing to testes
[3:16:28] Daarksyde: monkeys shooting up fireworks is the new thing
[3:16:29] sliproach: if the dancing monkeys aren't on live
[3:16:29] Wolfenhoof: so they have to remove it 6 months after release maybe
[3:16:31] MrFuzzynuts420: now try the forge?
[3:16:32] juga27: !alpha
[3:16:32] Dagomarus: The monkeys need to be live
[3:16:32] Moobot: @juga27 ALPHA PHASE 3 TODAY - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Waking Shores (60-63) - Maybe New Dungeon/Class Talents? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[3:16:33] OviTheGray: @TheCliffyShow on the shop :)
[3:16:42] marZau: hey @Towelliee  do you keep conquest going into season 4?
[3:16:44] pavepawns: i kinda like it tho
[3:16:49] banishtyrion: they should keep cpt exposition when they enable skipping stuff
[3:16:49] ArcaneSyntax: her hits model was giga thick tho
[3:16:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: could be worse, could be a bowl of fruit
[3:16:55] Sollice: Nah they need to widen her hips and boobas
[3:17:01] Araphas: armor looks linda overdesigned
[3:17:02] Coriollis: except eyes too wide is okayish
[3:17:03] notColt45: nerfed Madge
[3:17:04] SLoPPYALieN: @banishtyrion That would be dope!!
[3:17:08] generaljosh721: Mommy?
[3:17:11] thebakeriscomingforu: it would be funny if the small monkeys are hanging out in the different life pools though
[3:17:15] zastin586: @Towelliee try using the forge now
[3:17:16] HaloS23: im not against the art style going that way TBH
[3:17:18] Rudric_Ice: wrong alex looks shit in WoW she doesn't look anything like in Hots
[3:17:21] banishtyrion: :D
[3:17:21] emznev: @Sollice jesus LUL
[3:17:38] Hawlk: you thinking november or december for release?
[3:17:42] TheCliffyShow: More booba and revealed mid-drift for Alex.
[3:17:43] manmower: keep it down out there!!
[3:17:45] pavepawns: the monkeys are messing up the eggs
[3:17:48] NinjaChane: see? we can write story. tell us we did good
[3:17:49] pavepawns: beat em up
[3:17:50] wade_2go: Can you fly with normal flying mount in the new zones?
[3:17:50] NinjaChane: lol
[3:17:50] ShadoodHD: did the invite come out already?
[3:18:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: @wade_2go not at launch maybe later like normal
[3:18:09] mashiesmashie: shame they arent letting the regular peeps in yet...
[3:18:09] ArcaneSyntax: most of them will be in game, but that's a good amount.
[3:18:09] Darzetti_: story ling questing is looking pretty solid
[3:18:15] warrenny: This the first zone ?
[3:18:29] wade_2go: @haxzorjimduggan thanks!
[3:18:31] Mecabeast: still think aspect of the black dragonflight should go to ebonhorn
[3:18:38] jamzix1: will bonus rolls come back or no?
[3:18:39] ShadoodHD: another week of no invite towCopium towCopium
[3:18:41] OviTheGray: maybe on the hill
[3:18:54] banishtyrion: inside one of the towers ?
[3:19:05] pushnoir: there was definitely no CE invite this latest build at least. Only your guild
[3:19:07] Rudric_Ice: WoW is more cartoony than Hots lol Hots alex is a much better representation of her
[3:19:11] OviTheGray: on the hill in front of the gate thingy?
[3:19:25] warrenny: @shadoodhd Alpha is streamers f/f mythic raiders are you them?
[3:19:56] Dudutoolbox: i wish they made the way the mount lands smoother feels a bit abrupt
[3:20:00] Dagomarus: Im gonna bet its under one of the archs to the bridge to main city
[3:20:03] oviepilif: that looks amazing the zone
[3:20:16] warrenny: Nice view
[3:20:17] ShadoodHD: no but i like to fuck around with the alpha invites KEKW
[3:20:17] banishtyrion: maybe check those lookout towers that are around the castle ?
[3:20:41] loutre_malgache: Am I the only one being "Bothered" by the fact that when you dive down with your drake, the drake has its wongs spread ? I means if you're looking to go down fast to gain momentum, it would have its wings "folded" 🤔
[3:20:58] Kastarian001: Paladin talents fixed yet?
[3:21:03] cajunw33dh3ad: Kinda dumb you can’t make male and female human dracthyr and make male and female dracthyr
[3:21:07] LawnSpeaker: Is the draw distance for players still pretty short?
[3:21:12] zastin586: Maybe under that big bridge leading to valdraken ?
[3:21:27] anygrinders: is it possible to disable the dragonflight animation ?
[3:21:39] Dagomarus: Ud think they would show on the mini map or something (the skill points)
[3:21:42] sharendil: what's your opinion on cd from dragonriding abilities ?
[3:22:14] teeders: maybe dragons have to keep their wings spread to dive there are no experts in Dragon physiology
[3:22:26] freetherocktv: @anygrinders I don't think so because you use that animation to determine you are going fast enough to do stuff while flying
[3:22:32] Dudutoolbox: i mean how different is it from birds
[3:22:34] zastin586: those feats of strength will most likely be hidden on live
[3:22:40] nvnto: mapped out in wowhead guide day one Kappa
[3:22:40] anygrinders: @freetherocktv, interesting, thanks!
[3:22:45] Rudric_Ice: so the next build is the last build for alpha ?
[3:22:50] mmrghost7: secret LUL in days of addons
[3:22:52] TheCliffyShow: By day one, someone will have an add-on that shows where all of them are.
[3:23:03] Kisswani: I remember during the deep dive they said something about players having that alexstraza cinematic moment . that could be it with the glyph
[3:23:07] ShadoodHD: is there any obstacle course like the dragonriding race in Azure Span?
[3:23:07] nvnto: it's phase 3 and they have at least 6.
[3:23:15] fearlessfungi: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP

[3:39:27] fistofnature: thats what i do
[3:39:30] Mecabeast: they don't want you to socket s4 gear day 1
[3:39:37] PadidinJones: I think Blizz is thinking that they can give us such a disappointing update just so they can then roll out the exciting DI
[3:39:55] Molvonos: towCopium towCopium
[3:39:56] smashwow: 100% it's the socket thing if S4 sockets are done the same way
[3:39:59] PvtHudson093: what if i want to use it on a s3 item from next weeks vault?
[3:40:08] tehworks: classic wotlk hype

[3:42:59] manmower: so a free upgrade on your bow up to 285
[3:43:09] Thoreya: ill prob do nathria once and be done with s4 raiding lol
[3:43:14] looney199725: @Rudric_Ice cuz blizz dont care about pvp haha
[3:43:21] thunder993: there is s4 pvp mount, so there is pvp season
[3:43:36] thunder993: transmog will be same I think

[3:44:17] theoriginalzinng: inc jailer mace nerf
[3:44:41] raye_gaming22: @theoriginalzinng the KT sword veinripen and jaler maice getting gutted
[3:44:44] PadidinJones: This feels like poop man
[3:44:45] Banjo586: basically everything sounded good though
[3:44:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: im just gonna show up on my dragon boy in prepatch
[3:44:49] ArcaneSyntax: how is it confusing
[3:44:51] pushnoir: idk why they dont mention the difficulty of the raids. Whats the ilvl scaling for CN and SoD?
[3:44:52] Banjo586: they thought it over a lot
[3:44:52] Joneeeez: season 4 is a really cool change, which also is new, blizzards doing their best!
[3:44:54] Thoreya: ya, just doin the new dungeons on new chars and im chillin
[3:44:57] Orthobullet: you can buy 3 pieces of raid gear and upgrade them to mythic
[3:44:57] thebakeriscomingforu: a lot of test just to mean "just have fun"
[3:45:05] thebakeriscomingforu: text*
[3:45:09] looney199725: and then you spend all your time in s4
[3:45:10] ArcaneSyntax: that's for the theorcrafters
[3:45:10] TompsonX: Isn't it a good thing that they made changes? It's just overwhelming in pure text form frontloaded
[3:45:16] looney199725: for pre patch to hit and give you ilvl 290 gear too
[3:45:20] Mitune: all that matter is that it sounds like Blizzard was listening to peoples concerns
[3:45:22] khrownoes: when is that patch
[3:45:26] thunder993: people asked for all of this
[3:45:33] Mecabeast: as long as I can buy gavel, jaithys and ows I'll be happy
[3:45:40] sliproach: @looney199725 sounds about right
[3:45:42] Kisswani: fated viewer raids at launch ?
[3:45:46] Joneeeez: I do believe season 4 might make people to sub to wow again, haven't played since like 9.0 so Im excited
[3:45:47] PvtHudson093: the take away from this is that you can do LFR if you only kill half the bosses in the raid
[3:45:51] cabalish: where are all the vendors for the new shit ?
[3:45:59] Kriven: meh i could care less about season 4 im just ready for the expansion
[3:46:02] TheCheeseWheel87: What is the season 4 M+ affixes
[3:46:03] Angsterz: do you like the new changes to dragonflying? how does the turn feel?
[3:46:08] CasuallyEfficient: Viewer raids? What’s that
[3:46:08] manmower: gonna be new dungeon rotation
[3:46:12] Daarksyde: everyone go and touch the grass.  GOGO
[3:46:15] PvtHudson093: @cabalish next to the vault
[3:46:17] Carahail: @TheCheeseWheel87 shaded
[3:46:23] thebakeriscomingforu: yeah that is nice. typically its a "dead" time for guilds leading up to the next expansion.
[3:46:38] cabalish: @PvtHudson093 thx
[3:46:45] TheCheeseWheel87: @TheCheeseWheel87 what does that ential?
[3:47:26] Carahail: @TheCheeseWheel87 there are hidded dreadlords that when you kill them you get a staking buff
[3:47:38] Kisswani: dreadlords disguised as mobs , if you kill them you get a stat buff @TheCheeseWheel87
[3:47:57] TheCheeseWheel87: oh sick, i just found it on wowhead thanks
[3:47:58] pushnoir: S4 will be a fucking bugfiesta, calling it already. They have done 0 testing on the raids and the m+ dungeons and i doubt they could get QA testers to go through it while they are busy making builds for DF
[3:48:10] sliproach: @Carahail NGL read that as skating buff THPS M+
[3:48:33] Carahail: @sliproach LOl
[3:48:43] MrFuzzynuts420: i can't wait to see people yelling at each other about how to do the older dungeons properly LUL
[3:48:50] looney199725: @Roostertoast guess i know how im gearing all my new alts
[3:49:43] Kisswani: I need to get enough alts leveled for the professions in DF
[3:49:45] sliproach: @Roostertoast but current honor gear can't have set bonus added to it
[3:50:25] Bentzer87: @Kisswani How many would be enough? :D
[3:50:40] sliproach: @Roostertoast idd
[3:50:48] SynnZero: I wonder if they plan on adding more zone music. So far it seems to be a repeat of other expacs.
[3:51:04] cruzeal: storm peaks music Kreygasm
[3:51:16] OviTheGray: @SynnZero is not in-game music
[3:51:32] Kisswani: @Bentzer87 haven't done the math yet LUL probably gonna end up with 6
[3:52:21] Bentzer87: @Kisswani Got my 21th toon up yesterday
[3:53:12] Kisswani: @Bentzer87 yeah you're good LUL
[3:53:55] Quojin: @SynnZero there is no in-game music atm, this is Towelliees

[3:54:48] MrFuzzynuts420: whos taking bets thats DF comes out in dec? no way they'd release it in Nov when Wrath comes out just before Oct...
[3:55:03] onous_: therealonous subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! What's good pimpin! In your opinion,  What's the outlook for WoW seem to you? And do you think DH is going to be a busted class since you've only got havoc and vengeance.
[3:55:14] Nerendis: How’s the sod settling?
[3:55:14] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[3:55:44] mashiesmashie: Is there any sign of Archaeology?
[3:55:52] KaisenSiru: Pog
[3:55:58] r1ftzxd: its a mistake that they arn't raising legendary ilvls in s4
[3:56:04] falldrgn: @mashiesmashie Not yet. I know they want to something with it
[3:56:05] PvtHudson093: JC trinkets have me so wet
[3:56:22] mavericks312: idk I feel like archeology could he great in DF
[3:56:26] racketpunch: hows the rotation regarding the amount of buttons to be pressed?  did they add to it or is it the same as SL?  felt like a pro starcraft player as an Outlaw Rogue in SL
[3:56:29] mashiesmashie: That's a shame
[3:56:30] onous_: There goes the mount farmers.
[3:56:41] merevin: is this new stream layout?
[3:56:42] karter2811: just get 1 intern to make a bunch of digging shit for mounts and relics are recipes and shit, cant be too hard surely
[3:56:45] RiptoreCA: I think they just want to start to phase out legendaries and the grind for them. Since it appears DF won't have that system
[3:56:51] TheCliffyShow: I hope so. To much potential there. Artifacts for dragons, centaurs, tuskar, gnolls, Djaradins
[3:56:54] no4sh: df would be the right place settingwise to start archeology again
[3:57:05] Scoodles91: Wrong scene
[3:57:07] megamanx9999: Wait they're actually doing something with it like legitimately doing something with it at all wow that's surprising
[3:57:13] mashiesmashie: @TheCliffyShow This ^
[3:57:23] megamanx9999: I mean when was the last time they did anything with archeology I think legion
[3:57:50] AP__Simps: bfa had some
[3:57:51] mavericks312: draenor or legion
[3:57:54] onous_: It's been awhile
[3:57:56] ambiotic: legion moose mount
[3:57:57] TheCliffyShow: BFA had some archelogy stuff but nothing all that new.
[3:57:58] megamanx9999: wow
[3:57:58] instant_savage: legion had the spreacteal moose
[3:57:59] SirVoro: Legion I think
[3:58:00] Jsibs: Legion
[3:58:01] mashiesmashie: yeah they skipped Shadowlands
[3:58:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: legion had those rotating quests
[3:58:02] Kastarian001: Legion with the weekly special quests, then BfA had it to a very minor degree
[3:58:03] onous_: I thought legion
[3:58:04] PadidinJones: I think Legion had it
[3:58:05] NickLeonhearth: BFA had new stuff
[3:58:06] BoezIRL: legion mount
[3:58:12] megamanx9999: I'm kind of interested to see what they do with it at all I mean I mean anything at this point is good right
[3:58:17] PadidinJones: Thats a cool mount btw @Towelliee
[3:58:18] Scoodles91: and an apearance for the artefact
[3:58:21] StraightErro: legion had the pristine artifact shelves in the hall in dalaran
[3:58:22] Bentzer87: @Towelliee I would loved for them to do some kind of MoP Scenario's combined with Chromie's death from Legion. Could been perfect for Dragonflight with Bronze and Infinite dragons.
[3:58:31] TheCliffyShow: Legion had the archelogy quests for things like the moose.
[3:58:44] SLoPPYALieN: i bet you can :D
[3:58:56] Darisen: i feel like not doing archeology stuff in dragon isle is a missed opportunity
[3:59:08] Kastarian001: All Arch needs is to reward transmog and pets, then have a few dozen trash items with some cool lore tied to it. I miss Arch a lot, the tidbits were cool
[3:59:15] maxkule: @Towelliee Will Maghar Orcs be the OP Dragon Riding race because of their 10% faster speed? With leaderboards it might be a factor.
[3:59:24] TheCliffyShow: Titancum
[3:59:43] MrFuzzynuts420: @Darisen they're so focused on revamping the professions that will have players crafting for each other
[3:59:47] megamanx9999: yep
[3:59:47] ArcaneSyntax: I think archeology is getting reworked to be less boring as shit.
[3:59:53] mashiesmashie: I wouldn't mind them doing it in a later patch to buff content.
[3:59:57] manmower: probably when we get the underground patch
[3:59:57] adambtwitchtv: blizz didnt like Archeology did they
[4:00:11] TollBoothVideos: surprise Archeology in next alpha phase?
[4:00:17] winchez_: a spectral dragon mount would be kinda cool
[4:00:22] Scoodles91: well isnt it going to be consdered grave robbing if you dig dragon bones ? :D
[4:00:24] TollBoothVideos: probs a 10.2 feature
[4:00:26] PigPenLen: @ArcaneSyntax LUL towHAMUP
[4:00:30] TheCliffyShow: Don't you head to Dragon Isles with a bunch of archeologists?
[4:00:32] Darisen: @MrFuzzynuts420 yea i get that, but still, the dragon isle have been locked from everyone since how long ? thats why i think its a missed opportunity, even though the prof stuff is cool
[4:00:35] Kastarian001: Arch was kinda boring in terms of the loop but fishing is still around. Its nice to do some low effort grinding like that
[4:00:38] Kisswani: I would have been more understanding to no Archaeology if they just said : " sorry , not enough time "
[4:00:42] Eregbueye: Archaeology raid
[4:00:42] TollBoothVideos: top right!
[4:00:45] SLoPPYALieN: first page
[4:00:45] manmower: if it's coming in DF they've already started making it

[4:01:04] TollBoothVideos: reagant lady, top right
[4:01:06] SLoPPYALieN: nope
[4:01:07] Holysal: @TollBoothVideos just delete it
[4:01:14] HaloS23: @Towelliee my guess is when the Old Gods start making a come back Arch will become relevant.
[4:01:15] manmower: profession ingredients from archeology
[4:01:16] biirrd: second item on the second vendor
[4:01:28] mashiesmashie: They advertised the expansion in the release stream as an "exploration" type expansion so I assumed it would be a part of it
[4:01:40] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:01:50] tornbraclet: mass prospecting should be a higher rank i think
[4:01:52] reverseevolving: Hi!
[4:01:52] manmower: they gave us photography instead of archeology
[4:01:54] Holysal: @mashiesmashie they gave up on that it seems
[4:03:01] mashiesmashie: @Holysal Possibly was referring to Dragon Riding and I took it out of context
[4:03:11] stabzmcgeee: HI
[4:03:18] Holysal: @mashiesmashie oh ok oops
[4:03:26] TheCliffyShow: I'd be down with photography. Maybe, try to get some pictures of Alexstraza in the shower.
[4:03:32] ur_avg_tryhard: Big fan of the blizz UI overhaul
[4:03:33] Kastarian001: Remember the Arch items that described the dwarfs fighting the dragon? Wish the journal just had sagas like that which you could complete by finding the relics
[4:03:42] mashiesmashie: @Holysal I instantly thought of Explorers League etc
[4:03:54] PigPenLen: @manmower so did Hefner and that turned out well LUL
[4:04:00] BoezIRL: did u check ret?
[4:04:09] tornbraclet: towelliee is going to make those glasses kekw
[4:04:57] PvtHudson093: Like  a Rhinestone Cowboy
[4:05:13] tornbraclet: those half frame glasses looked good
[4:05:39] r1ftzxd: you need an ultrawide
[4:05:47] TollBoothVideos: Soul complained about that yesterday too. how do we know we look good??
[4:06:01] Eregbueye: can be seen only in VR
[4:06:33] teeq_010: @Towelliee what you like more so far bear tank or prot pally
[4:06:34] Zayvion: its better than not having one
[4:06:39] racketpunch: pay them tailors for that
[4:06:39] Deadelus0: moar bags!
[4:06:42] TollBoothVideos: Do you feel that 5 tiers of items is too much?
[4:06:51] theoriginalzinng: the stacks go way higher hto
[4:06:52] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:06:55] Mitune: I mean if crafting pulls from the reagents bank then it should be ok
[4:07:14] zorantt: Mind you, during live, you will only have at most 5 professions (2 primary and whatever secondary professions you will have)
[4:07:18] TheCliffyShow: I wanna be the very best. Like no one ever was.
[4:07:23] HaloS23: @Towelliee I think Blizz underestimates our ability to horde!!!
[4:07:27] sliproach: @Mitune does on live
[4:07:54] loutre_malgache: Well, you can use your items in your bank to craft even if not in your inventory so ... When you come back from farming, just put everything in the back. Those slots will be enough, unless you want EVERYTHING ANYTIME 🤔
[4:08:00] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee do you think crafters will still be charging insane amounts of gold for gear?
[4:08:10] Kastarian001: I dont get the symbols. You have one copper diamond, two silver diamond, three gold, etc etc. Why not just use the colours, why the amount difference?
[4:08:29] zorantt: For work orders, do the player create the price? @Towelliee
[4:08:50] LuxhianPendragon: How are you feeling with prot pala?
[4:09:04] Quojin: page 13
[4:09:18] cinamonjackz: are you hopeful that the paladin tree will be revised @Towelliee? I feel like the talents that are just stat sticks are just lazy cop-outs
[4:09:18] Sollice: The Price is Wrong Bitch!
[4:09:19] cahoots82: The price is wrong, bitch!
[4:09:22] Mitune: @sliproach I figured so yeah that bag is big enough since the new cap for stack is 1k imo
[4:09:25] zorantt: Doordash Wow version :P Nice
[4:09:36] tornbraclet: i wonder if they are going to use a work order system like in eq2?
[4:10:04] loutre_malgache: Is the one creating the order giving his mats or is it the crafter that brong the mats ? Because if it's the creator of the order, it will create a pretty big problem :x
[4:10:12] TheCliffyShow: Now, I wanna watch Happy Gilmore.
[4:10:27] sliproach: @Mitune should be wish they'd add auto sort to Guild banks to rather having to manually stack the items
[4:10:28] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Protection Paladin Talents & Abilities - Eye of Tyr RETURNS! youtu.be/pjIT8tV_QKM
[4:10:31] mwchaos: the work orders set the rate for the tips tho no?
[4:10:35] MrFuzzynuts420: my server has some gatekeepers with the AH so i can see them charging people 500k for a weapon
[4:10:43] SynnZero: Like I feel the bots are going to ruin this system :/
[4:10:52] Mitune: oh def @sliproach The fact they have it in bags and not in bags is crazy
[4:11:05] Alepouditsa: the crafting gear will be beter then raids then?
[4:11:19] ZeusDNA: So then you charge 400k and undercut them :)
[4:11:21] zorantt: Like Synn said, I feel like bots will ruin it. I know you said there's a 30 CD of making orders but still
[4:11:28] loutre_malgache: @towelliee Is the one creating the order giving his mats or is it the crafter that brong the mats ? Because if it's the creator of the order, it will create a pretty big problem :x
[4:11:35] zorantt: 30 min*
[4:11:38] raye_gaming22: Ion said it wont be near the cost of the legos to craft gear
[4:11:43] stabzmcgeee: @loutre_malgache its both
[4:11:54] SynnZero: @zorantt Exactly. They will work in numbers to get around that 30 mins
[4:12:00] stabzmcgeee: @chizu_gaming he cant say that for sure when its a player set econmy
[4:12:01] raye_gaming22: so i dont thnik it will be 500k
[4:12:31] jetributions: vendor item

[4:12:49] zorantt: @SynnZero exactly
[4:12:50] Mitune: Do we know if the work order cooldown is account-wide or if its per character?
[4:13:00] banishtyrion: sounds like that's made by alchemy ?
[4:13:07] raye_gaming22: @stabzmcgeee he can set the number of reagets as he want
[4:13:13] OviTheGray: and also they said, the craftee offers the pay, if the crafter takes it fine.. if not, someone else will
[4:13:44] stabzmcgeee: @chizu_gaming ok but regardless of what the reagent price is is the sellers/crafters set the price at 500k then its 500k
[4:13:57] zorantt: Posting @loutre_malgache 's question. @towelliee Is the one creating the order giving his mats or is it the crafter that brong the mats ? Because if it's the creator of the order, it will create a pretty big problem :x

[4:14:46] Kastarian001: Those shoulders will look dope on a Dark Iron Dwarf
[4:14:47] metavahn231: whens wotlk fresh start server doe
[4:14:54] Biorrwolf: What's the point of retail when I can't even play Furbolg yet?
[4:14:58] Leelo4673: Not sure wether to start playing this game again. Stopped in shadowlands
[4:15:04] PadidinJones: That gear though. Sick AF

[4:15:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: @elixirfield1 fresh starts with prepatch which we dont have a date yet for
[4:15:22] stabzmcgeee: @chizu_gaming then that still has nothing to do with ion and setting prices
[4:15:25] PadidinJones: We will play Murlocs before Furblogs
[4:15:37] macleod29: @ towelliee morning towelliee and chat! Getting my wow fix and dragonflight info while running heavy equipment and having the stream play through the speakers lol
[4:15:44] zorantt: Furbolgs confirmed! 13.0. Towelliee  leaked it. Kappa
[4:15:54] Leelo4673: Is this worth playing again?
[4:15:56] Lythoraxx: with what ilvl do you start in the new expansion. i mean ilvl of first questgear?
[4:16:03] unresolved_broccoli: kobold paladin
[4:16:14] Wolfenhoof: A dancing tauren is one of the most joyful and moojestic things you can see in azeroth.
[4:16:18] loutre_malgache: @towelliee wouldn't there be bots that instantly accept every single orders possible to get every commissions if the crafter don't bring anything ? There would be automatic systems that instantly take every single order. There should be a timer for crafters to take orders too
[4:16:19] goosejamss: Naga or bust
[4:16:29] sliproach: @roguedeeps they do like the light Kappa
[4:16:41] unresolved_broccoli: @sliproach lol
[4:16:52] tumtillion: Tuskar would be alliance or neutral?
[4:16:53] nostragen: murloc DK!
[4:17:28] ArcaneSyntax: Man that is one happy tauren
[4:17:31] szble: no shot
[4:17:33] drewetling: speed bump
[4:17:36] Biorrwolf: Tuskar and Tortla
[4:17:39] tehrobtar: i'd love tuskarr
[4:17:39] zorantt: Are work orders only for max professions? or can you accept work orders while leveling professions? @Towelliee
[4:17:39] TheCliffyShow: Nothing comes before High Elves and Orges.
[4:17:44] HyirGaming: I thought they said there was going to be a daily limit on work orders
[4:17:45] tehrobtar: omg yes and tortollan
[4:17:47] Dashamidon: They Said similiar to When crafting Came out in Pandaria with cooldown Mechanics
[4:17:48] NicktheGatorfin: Tuskar for the alliance, Gnolls for the Horde would be awesome
[4:17:50] loutre_malgache: I hope there is, but the cooldown must be very precisely great. So that it's not too long for people to have all their orders made, but not too short to be abused by bots.
[4:17:51] BarthelemeusNL: thuskar alliance gnoll horde?
[4:17:51] szble: id put money on tuskarr never happening
[4:17:53] raye_gaming22: you have a quest a week that give you some reaget you need to craft gear tahts confirmed allready not sure about pots tho
[4:17:55] zgag: The Oppenheime trailer was just released
[4:17:55] sliproach: @tumtillion next panda they get to choose
[4:17:57] Wolfenhoof: @ArcaneSyntax its so beautiful BibleThump
[4:18:00] HaloS23: @Towelliee is there a limit on how long you can have a work order? like once you accept, you have an hour to complete?
[4:18:01] Kastarian001: Where my Vrykul at
[4:18:03] DerekHuard: i want to be a damn duck
[4:18:10] zgag: Oppenheimer *
[4:18:12] kokochris: its murlocs for the next playable race.  When you die, you immediately spawn two of you next.  Because those little fuckers are everywhere
[4:18:14] raymond3195: tuskar will never happen
[4:18:20] iRegretn0thing: They could make the beefy wingless dragon NPC's as an allied race to play other classes and keep Dracthyr as Evokers? @Towelliee
[4:18:20] tumtillion: @sliproach yea I could see that
[4:18:27] loragheta: @NicktheGatorfin tauren are descendants from tuskarr so horde would get it not alliance.
[4:18:32] szble: KEKW
[4:18:34] TheCliffyShow: High Elves and Orges! Nothing like more important.
[4:18:37] Biorrwolf: At least a Furbolg druid form
[4:18:38] taintalizerx: I'd like to be one of those void transmog npcs lol
[4:18:40] zgag: Christopher Nolan’s new movie
[4:18:41] ArcaneSyntax: Tuskar and Gnolls are what I want
[4:18:42] HyirGaming: Tali is never wrong
[4:18:44] Niiol__: same as you would never play dragon, right :D
[4:18:44] TheItalianStallion321: its Toweldamus
[4:18:45] BlewGamingGroup: going to see people just posted up at the order vendor all day every day
[4:18:47] Tzarrus: Tuskarr probably at the end of the expac
[4:18:50] SynnZero: To be very frank, cd's are not going to stop bots. They operate in large numbers.
[4:18:54] lalelusa: maybe as a .3 patch type goodie to keep people playing
[4:18:57] ArcaneSyntax: Tuskar for alliance, gnolls for horde
[4:19:01] Dashamidon: I think Tuskarr will be out as allied race before End of this next expansion
[4:19:06] Wolfenhoof: @NicktheGatorfin thats not Tuskarr thats Yaungol
[4:19:08] OviTheGray: if blizz gives the players all the races they want, we'll have 100 playable races :)
[4:19:10] paradoxTheDJ: Cow
[4:19:11] Biorrwolf: Hogger?! I hardly know her!
[4:19:20] JokaThS: i just want sethrak
[4:19:28] mrmanno14: centaur allied race lets goo
[4:19:30] Lythoraxx: @OviTheGray what would be wrong with that ? ^^
[4:19:30] raymond3195: Ian poured cold water on that talking to tallasin
[4:19:44] Kyrrua: what the heck is this atrocity
[4:19:47] ArcaneSyntax: Hogger is dead so, probably not
[4:19:49] flamekaster: warchef hogger
[4:19:51] Sarocus: Hogger is dead, though
[4:19:51] TheCliffyShow: Imagine all the "WoW is full of furries" comments that will happen if they add stuff like Tuskarr, gnolls, and furblogs. Like most fantasy universes don't have a bunch of animal races.
[4:19:56] Biorrwolf: I want to be a Red Draenei
[4:20:00] iRegretn0thing: Id think the alliance would be pissed if the gnolls were on the horde tbh
[4:20:01] OviTheGray: @Lythoraxx way too many
[4:20:02] TheCliffyShow: @ArcaneSyntax There must always be a Hogger.
[4:20:05] NEMERL: Gnolls are brainleees creatuer they wont work as allaied race
[4:20:06] iRegretn0thing: but hey they are friends with orcs so
[4:20:08] Sollice: @ArcaneSyntax You can not kill which can not die
[4:20:09] PadidinJones: But Hogger got killed by 40 lvl 1 gnomes!
[4:20:16] ArcaneSyntax: HOGGER, SON OF HOGGER
[4:20:26] Wolfenhoof: considering the amount of text that Baine had it SL, i don't see a problem with Hogger as 50 IQ Warchief.
[4:20:39] BarthelemeusNL: races dont need to be smart to be playable we can play as goblins and they havnt made a working invention in 10 years evrythings blows up
[4:20:43] Biorrwolf: @thecliffyshow or Worgen. Or Vulpera. Or Druids in general. Or Dragonkin, I mean, Dracthyr. I can't imagine.
[4:20:48] ArcaneSyntax: Also the gnolls are intelligent, they practice shamanism and some druid magic
[4:21:02] zorantt: Are dual stat gems back? @Towelliee Sweet
[4:21:05] Animemron: I want ogre playable race please! :D
[4:21:07] Biorrwolf: @hegnar Just as players don't need to be smart to play
[4:21:16] ashnmsr: 3 sockets?
[4:21:18] TheCliffyShow: @Biorrwolf An Eredar? I agree. The story could be simple to. After the defeat of the Burning Legion, some break their corruption, and want to rejoin their Draenei brethen.
[4:21:29] raymond3195: don't see allied races for a few years
[4:21:35] ashnmsr: are we going to have multiple sockets like before?
[4:21:42] Xailen: Hogger wasnt killed, he was beat and imprisoned. But that wasnt him, it was some girl in a hogger suit. He is smarter than anyone realizes...
[4:21:51] Biorrwolf: @thecliffyshow would be easy to give the DK treatment
[4:21:56] xNailus: i think is cuzz of the quality of your neck
[4:22:05] xNailus: your neck is tier 1 should it be tier 2 to have 2 sockets?
[4:22:11] zorantt: Hogger got transported to the Nexus instead of imprisonment :P
[4:22:13] ArcaneSyntax: @Xailen that's a meme in the scenario, the person we killed in stockades was the real hogger
[4:22:16] Biorrwolf: Hogger > Jailer. He's behind it all
[4:22:30] NEMERL: Pog
[4:22:42] TheCliffyShow: @Biorrwolf Exactly! They could go the lame route, and make it a customization option for Draenei, but then they couldn't be warlocks.
[4:22:46] sliproach: @Xailen you're saying hogger on par with skaven council from Warhammer?
[4:22:46] Wolfenhoof: Painful to see those guardians. They could have given us real draconians, but we are getting scaled Jar Jar Binks.
[4:23:39] Kastarian001: Now that we dont care about showing armour on characters can I get Naga?
[4:23:52] nightwolf_87: Super Happy to see JC back !, @Towelliee JC is the best proff for alpha tanks !
[4:23:52] Dystilled: Drakthyr are healers too, they have to be able to be nerdsd
[4:23:56] Dystilled: nerds*
[4:23:57] Manabucho: does the avenger shield dmg talent work with divine toll??
[4:23:58] TompsonX: I don't mind the Drachtyr, but I find it weird that we can't just play the npc forms, it's not like we can use the regular equipment either way
[4:24:04] Wolfenhoof: I am old, i am used to Dragonlance Draconians from the 80s.
[4:24:15] PvtHudson093: no one wants a skinny ass twink dwagon :D
[4:24:18] zorantt: What? You don't want to raid with 20 huge dragon models? @Towelliee Kappa
[4:24:23] TheCliffyShow: People got those big buff dragon fantasies.
[4:24:37] TheGiant99: @wolfenhoof people will never be happy no matter what they do. if you don't like them don't play one
[4:24:43] Lazermage23: Still no mass craft?
[4:24:45] Biorrwolf: @thecliffyshow It could be written in that they've renounced their practice of the fel arts. Giving a reason as to why no Warlock
[4:24:53] sliproach: why change bodies to type sound like you gotta choose what diabetes you got
[4:24:54] TompsonX: Racist modzSTARE
[4:24:57] Gillrad: bad take
[4:25:04] stabzmcgeee: but you're ok with tauren?
[4:25:20] TheCliffyShow: @Biorrwolf But, I wanna be a Eredar warlock.

[4:26:49] stabzmcgeee: so what difference would it make if the drac were bigger to make more of the players happy,,, aslong as they are the same size as tauren then it makes no difference
[4:26:54] drewetling: i want a fat boy dragon
[4:26:59] Dystilled: @Wolfenhoof why not both!

[4:28:31] TheItalianStallion321: they are filming like a whole season of episodes or something i dont know
[4:28:44] broel95: Think so, cuz he said he wanted to move away from australia
[4:28:49] stabzmcgeee: i mean he has nothing in aus atm so why not live it up on a working holiday
[4:29:04] Mattsta: i think he is done with the event...but he wanted to stay for a couple more weeks so he could do more of his own stuff
[4:29:15] lukepizzaguy: lol

[4:42:43] ArcaneSyntax: trying to judge anything right now is dumb
[4:42:43] vikingskog: is paladin mobility any better in dragonflight?
[4:42:52] TheItalianStallion321: asking about tier lists in an alpha is absurb IMO
[4:43:00] sliproach: @Towelliee makes sence druid trees structued better druid and the connections to trees?
[4:43:08] raye_gaming22: there wont be a tierlist until end of HC week
[4:43:09] TheItalianStallion321: absurd*
[4:43:14] BfAleTitan: might as well do a tier list based on hearsay
[4:43:26] TheCliffyShow: So, you're saying, Warrior is the best tank.
[4:43:35] looney199725: druid had 4 specs needed more work prob why
[4:43:38] Match_play: Only bear druid is any good though
[4:43:42] VredTV: just make up a fake tier list to throw out there when people ask
[4:43:45] RandomXY: Guardian tree is really cool but dont look at feral. Poor cats.
[4:43:46] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, druid and shaman have the best trees hands down
[4:43:48] Match_play: the other specs need help, FERAL especially
[4:44:01] sliproach: @Match_play only druid spec tbh
[4:44:03] cthyt7: Just play the new class.  Blizz always make them oped at the start.
[4:44:04] belaham: Need some hopium for the prot warrior tree
[4:44:06] endsage21: hows jewelcrafting feeling? just hoped in
[4:44:11] Match_play: Druid tree is not nearly as good as shaman
[4:44:31] KurtMoe: Im leveling a prot warrior rn
[4:44:50] bowsers1: i want new rotation for warrior
[4:45:02] Ali_J1: dragon flight is basically shadowlands 2.0
[4:45:10] Zendhal: Give warriors Titans grip 2 shields!
[4:45:15] Waflestomper: just based on how absurd the ret tree is I would have to say they are far from done with tuning

[4:48:46] dewking93: whats the name of the new city?
[4:49:07] mayonaes: Aniima?
[4:49:09] Zendhal: Problem with prot warrior is that they make him blocking monster god of mitigation every expansion and then make every god damn tank buster abilities not blockable  while other tanks  active mitigation still works on them
[4:49:10] enux337: anima monkaS
[4:49:12] mayonaes: PTSD
[4:49:19] Jimstur: @Towelliee you happy with the state of paladin so far?

[4:52:37] smashwow: is the holy pally tree still fucked?
[4:52:42] Texas_Mizfit: fun detect that cant happen
[4:52:50] Dystilled: Are the statues soulbound?
[4:52:53] JellonaCub: So uldaman LFG would be "LF JC/mining last spot"
[4:53:30] smashwow: oh that's busted AF
[4:53:39] Jimstur: faceting dafuq??

[5:06:20] NEMERL: @Towelliee are u able to craft Trinkets?
[5:06:27] Allsee_: If the extra sockets were JC exclusive would make raiders forced to do JC

[5:12:30] manmower: @angrywowplayer1337 Wrathion sent them an edible arrangement, it's all good now

[5:17:37] manmower: will they do renown catchup each patch?
[5:17:37] Mitune: Have you done the pokemon snap stuff? @Towelliee
[5:17:39] lukepizzaguy: have you do this for Every item  you need to craft  to get the 5/6 star?
[5:17:42] Lostdogal: players logging out from boredom because they logged in to craft and the fun gets sucked out of it with long cooldowns
[5:17:46] foofighters182: KomodoHype
[5:18:06] strike879: rep is capped at exalted renown can go way higher
[5:18:08] ijuki: @Lostdogal Can always play alts Kappa
[5:18:11] TheCliffyShow: As long as there is something to keep THD busy.
[5:18:14] Jimstur: 4 ZM zones that are way larger than ZM. I like it.
[5:18:25] SLoPPYALieN: @gitaarluuk Yes, I think you just become really good at making one item... or if you want to be badass in all it is a shit ton of mats.
[5:18:34] zastin586: imo if they really wanted to make whole world feel alive, they should not only put world content all over, but also include old expansion mats in latest crafting recipes
[5:18:38] blocasaurus_rex: @Vanguard771 please do! so i can do it to
[5:18:47] Lostdogal: @Lostdogal you sure? because that didn't work in shadowlands and the expansion isn't out yet.
[5:18:59] j_bar111: @Towelliee how do profs work for like previous expacs?
[5:19:58] j_bar111: i imagine its just the old way but new ui

[5:20:23] manmower: does each zone have a talent system?
[5:20:26] MaleFrom73: if you don't do group content, is crafting the way to go to get the higehst gear?
[5:20:44] Architank: I wonder how many people are going to bee line weapon specialization
[5:20:50] manmower: thought they mentioned a system like ZM to get better at gameplay in the zone
[5:20:59] shaxxtv: its not adragon axpa... its all about archaeology
[5:21:06] PvtHudson093: WQ 3.0
[5:21:06] TheTazzyBoy: No lol
[5:21:12] raldrik: that would be awesome
[5:21:13] Torjix: Do you keep the profession progres if you switch between professions?

[5:21:18] schmooplesthesecond: kekw
[5:21:22] EKS90_: @sliproach I wouldn't expect this unfortunately.
[5:21:22] zastin586: In addition to dragon isles mats
[5:21:23] TheTazzyBoy: No ty
[5:21:27] thedr8993: no lmao that would be terrible
[5:21:28] Taaliaaaa: that sounds awful
[5:21:33] foofighters182: YESSSSS
[5:21:35] DramaticTv: FF does that and i hate it lol
[5:21:36] Ortinoth: that will make it to confusing and hard to accomplish and no it would not be good change
[5:21:37] Wolfenhoof: That wouldn't make the world alive, that would only make the freaking goldmakers happy that are botting/hording mats since years.
[5:21:37] bowsers1: instead of palying in dragon isles all the time
[5:21:41] raldrik: that might make leveling more fun
[5:21:41] foofighters182: SOUNDS AWESOME
[5:21:42] jiffypawp: like 90% current mats 10% old?
[5:21:42] strike879: for raid stuff no for fun stuff yes

[5:22:03] UltraContent: xo
[5:22:07] ZeusDNA: "Ugh, can't believe I have to play in this brand new zone all the time"
[5:22:09] cahoots82: Yeah, that sounds great until you have to do it
[5:22:10] Djfarmville: lets go back to farming garrison garden and mine
[5:22:11] SLoPPYALieN: @Zivvy__ LUL
[5:22:11] cahoots82: and you great everything
[5:22:12] moistdanglez: Classic andy, go play classic if you wanna hang out in old wow
[5:22:16] cahoots82: regreat*
[5:22:17] SensationalBanana: Would be horrific.
[5:22:17] Fugazi811: go play classic
[5:22:18] derElten: back to the farm in pandaria
[5:22:21] Wolfenhoof: I mean fuck DF, i go mine copper in Mulgore would be fine for me, but i am a sick old tauren freak.
[5:22:23] emznev: If i want to go to the barrens i think i will play classic
[5:22:23] UltraContent: u need to kill 20 level 3 pigs to craft your level 800 leg
[5:22:24] thedr8993: you can use old mats by playing classic
[5:22:25] postman_quest: Make old materials relevant again
[5:22:28] Mattsta: I think it would be a great idea for all flasks to require a mat that only drops in Torghast :)
[5:22:34] strike879: i mean for flasks hard pass but for a pet or something why not
[5:22:36] enux337: boomkins everywhere
[5:22:37] TheBoogs: I thought it sounded kinda cool :(
[5:22:37] cahoots82: silverleaf
[5:22:41] manmower: @zastin586 you're hired ~Bobby
[5:22:42] KydSage: goldthorn?
[5:22:45] KydSage: LUL
[5:22:48] belfastcl: that's what nw did and it was horrible
[5:22:50] zastin586: well, it works in FF, no reason it wouldn't work in WoW
[5:22:51] bowsers1: new material + old material
[5:22:52] TatarosTV: because my bank is full of them LUL
[5:22:52] Korupcija_: nostalgia andies
[5:22:58] Jimstur: @Towelliee shut up and take my copper ore!
[5:23:00] ZeusDNA: The people saying that have a bank full of it and can't sell it LUL
[5:23:06] ashnmsr: well it's not a bad idea , it's because the new material becomes cheap pretty fast
[5:23:07] Korupcija_: nvm, it's FF andies
[5:23:08] Fimbulforge: make copper relevant again Kappa
[5:23:09] Ortinoth: old mats are still very useable for tmog things - new mats current xpac
[5:23:11] ashnmsr: and everyone's farming them
[5:23:13] ccCMAC: go play classic if you want to use that shit
[5:23:15] sliproach: @Commander_Eggi i hope not bastion and teh forsworn they littery join the kyrian in the story but every WQ there kill the forsworn....
[5:23:16] Mecabeast: to the guy that suggested that towStop towIt
[5:23:16] Jokervenom1978: why even have new mats?? lets play in the old zones all the time! oh wait. thats classic wow
[5:23:17] TheCliffyShow: He's probably got a bunch of iron and gold he can't get rid of.
[5:23:18] suvati68: Why not? Make recipes using all content
[5:23:25] ashnmsr: it could be fun to have some specific items to make with old things
[5:23:30] Sollice: I am saying it
[5:23:34] Sollice: Fuck you go play Classic if you want
[5:23:35] Wolfenhoof: They tried to do that with SL, the goldmakers exploitet the shit out of it and the nerfed it to death before release with a reason.
[5:23:39] notColt45: ^^
[5:23:44] manmower: they'll add that when they add player housing and furniture crafting
[5:23:46] Exikos: somekind of mats converter could solve that "problem"
[5:23:49] foofighters182: MAKES PERFECT SENSE
[5:23:50] bowsers1: it offer more game option instead of locking you in DF for 2 years imo
[5:23:50] Ortinoth: that is a really stupid idea to use all mats from 8 years ago
[5:23:57] Norian45: Are there any mounts datamined for engi? Shadowlands engi was a bit meh.
[5:24:02] SLoPPYALieN: mix of old and new mats for battle pets or a mount or some other shenanigans... maybe?!
[5:24:03] Shaalil: I enjoyed how the worm battle pets are obtained in shadowlands. By farming old world grey items. More stuff like that is pretty cool
[5:24:06] Fragglevision: i think it would cause an auction issue as well
[5:24:07] vic_ave: if there was anymore reaching it would be a reach around
[5:24:16] ijuki: This mega super ultra rare sword needs 10 copper bars Kappa
[5:24:17] ZeusDNA: Seems legit
[5:24:18] Djfarmville: LUL
[5:24:18] DecayedmiNt: OMEGALUL
[5:24:19] Jimstur: EXACTLY Kappa
[5:24:24] Nicstar1007: whos Alvin
[5:24:25] Soproatlol: why not
[5:24:25] FatGuyonaHoverboard: sliver and gold is useless
[5:24:26] schmooplesthesecond: KEKW
[5:24:27] cahoots82: I don't see the issue...
[5:24:27] Alienfromger: makes sense Kappa
[5:24:32] BlewGamingGroup: makes total sense
[5:24:32] Fugazi811: LUL
[5:24:33] moistdanglez: its really just someone who still has a crap load of old matts in the bank and wants to get gold for the farming they did 15 years ago. just let go bro, vendor them
[5:24:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: peacebloom was never an option
[5:24:38] TheBoogs: Nailed it. I’m in
[5:24:40] Rabiahtaro132: Only the strongest of dragons use copper mail gear from blacksmiths!
[5:24:40] manmower: Titans were all over Azeroth
[5:24:41] foofighters182: make old content relevant again
[5:24:43] Allsee_: Ah yes Peaceblooms making god slayer swords
[5:24:44] Sollice: @Soproatlol Because....its no longer the same recipe when you change ingredients.....
[5:24:47] TheCliffyShow: Dragons loved them some Fel Iron.
[5:24:48] PvtHudson093: massive elf orgies happened there
[5:24:51] Cojoha: insert smh & facepalm meme
[5:24:54] PhillyRhino: Imagine needing peacebloom to make mythic raiding gear
[5:24:55] Mecabeast: didn't they do something similar with optional reagents for old crafted gear
[5:25:00] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I need some copper ore to make my 3 socketed best in slot neck LOL
[5:25:02] Fragglevision: lmao "i just KNOW these will be good again some day..."
[5:25:03] schmooplesthesecond: L
[5:25:10] undesiredname: id like my sword to have the wood from eastvale logging camp
[5:25:14] manmower: Dragons are like Bees, the pollinated the rest of Azeroth with Dragon Isle herbs
[5:25:17] Jimstur: some people call it retro @Towelliee  xD
[5:25:23] cahoots82: I'd be cool with an herb trader of sorts wherein you could trade of herbs for other types of herbs
[5:25:35] Fragglevision: @cahoots82 this would be better
[5:25:40] Fragglevision: reasonable
[5:25:40] Ariea_Whisper: Ariea_Whisper subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! Chats on point today!  God I love ALPHA! Cheers to another month!
[5:25:44] strike879: ppl assume it goes about endgame items old mats could be used for fun stuff
[5:25:53] TatarosTV: they're doing it in season 4 shadowlands :D
[5:26:00] UltraKSlaya: it could be world content. work orders you could do for gold. 'Adventurer go farm this for me" sort of like bounties
[5:26:01] Fragglevision: but it'd be like a stack of old world herb/ore for only a couple new
[5:26:07] Edorasthegamer: Edorasthegamer gifted a Tier 1 sub to moistdanglez! They have given 150 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[5:26:24] Fugazi811: farming copper you could swing by Goldshire
[5:26:25] TheCornRatsss: cam evryone use the 3socket neck, or just jewelcrafters?
[5:26:26] gritbarontv: that would be 1.5 million copper for it :)
[5:26:29] MrHI6HWAY: i wish they could bring back first aid somehow
[5:26:35] DelroyTV: why not mass prospecting @Towelliee ?
[5:26:35] Rabiahtaro132: I want to decorate my evoker in the finest of Saronite necklaces
[5:26:35] Poriand: as a double gatherer im going to be RICH

[5:27:09] Ellippsis1: can you spec into prospecting?
[5:27:12] Norian45: I still have lots of tin ore that I can prospect. I am 100% ready for Dragongate
[5:27:18] looney199725: when its blue its the end game
[5:27:50] UltraKSlaya: it could be world content. work orders you could do for gold. 'Adventurer go farm this for me" sort of like bounties
[5:27:52] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee In GW2 it is relatively easy to get BiS. More advanced gear hast the convenience of being re-statted at will so you don't need a new set of gear to try a new build. That's also a gear direction to take.
[5:28:05] DelroyTV: even when you select more than 1?
[5:28:09] SLoPPYALieN: try moving the quantity to like 10 then hit create all... or create.
[5:28:24] VredTV: @Towelliee change the number and then click "create", should make several at once
[5:28:24] manmower: @Ooshraxa they're adding recrafting in DF
[5:28:25] strike879: wasnt mass prospect a thing on the JC table?

[5:28:44] McLeod25: transmog only
[5:28:47] cellarrr: tmog or toys
[5:28:48] Fragglevision: they just gotta have quests that require it or something
[5:28:51] pigzip: Can’t you set the number you want to create then just use the create button
[5:28:54] Drutaks: Maybe something thats tranmog
[5:28:55] Fragglevision: but nothing like gear related
[5:28:59] Haximaxi: can someone explain to me why he is prospecting only ?
[5:29:10] Ooshraxa: @pigzip it's borked
[5:29:10] OviTheGray: in Chromie time you use heirlooms

[5:30:34] TacooSZN: POWA
[5:30:38] shaxxtv: its about drive
[5:30:43] foofighters182: will profession talents be extended in future expansions?!
[5:30:43] Mecabeast: just use the net-o-matic to take down those pesky dragonriders flying around in warmode
[5:30:46] OmgItsEdizzle: lmao remember when everyone thought war mode was the savior of wow haha
[5:30:49] notColt45: Power? My people are addicted to it...
[5:30:49] EasilyZeroed: What realm do you play on (non alpha)?
[5:30:51] OmgItsEdizzle: lol world pvp
[5:30:58] raye_gaming22: for casuals maybe for us highd raiders we dont care about gear
[5:30:58] UltraContent: blizzard tipycal UNLIMITED POWER
[5:30:59] stabzmcgeee: i dont agree anymore,,, look at all the people that run +16 keys and higher
[5:31:04] CasuallyEfficient: Need more players in mythic 😂
[5:31:04] Miguel85NYC: ERP
[5:31:05] mongeon3626: I miss doing the for the horde achivment
[5:31:06] Funderik: makes me laugh when people say mythic should be cosmetic only, but those same people wouldn't be able to kill it and cry they can't get the mogs.
[5:31:06] Cojoha: Cash rules everything around me  CREAM get the money dolla dolla bills yall
[5:31:27] MrHI6HWAY: im all about power fishing
[5:31:50] HAMMERRAZOR: i cant wait for them to bring out the demon hunter talents
[5:31:53] watpuppy: @Towelliee Is there any feasible way to make old content or at least zones relevant again?
[5:31:59] Kyrrua: Wow is all about power, gear and boosting
[5:32:01] Wolfenhoof: best gear should drop from fishing
[5:32:02] Rabiahtaro132: I want to have the power to solo heroic dungeons.
[5:32:12] raye_gaming22: yes realz said its not finished
[5:32:17] Djfarmville: are warriors next?
[5:32:19] bapele45: has blacksmithing come out?
[5:32:21] HAMMERRAZOR: yea definitely, i feel liek they will have to add a bunch of new stuff to havoc and vengeance
[5:32:23] manmower: they're adding a ton of new stuff for these talent tree revamps
[5:32:36] stabzmcgeee: he never said last,, he just said that it wasnt done yet
[5:32:38] dutrockbridge: Same person that did the Rogue trees, so got a late start
[5:32:41] ItsGigg: I was watching max's stream and he made a really good point. DH doesn't have really old talents to pull from so they literally gotta make shit up, while rouge has tons and tons of old stuff they no longer have
[5:32:49] xMortal_Wombatx: What do you think about the Paladin talents so far? @Towelliee
[5:32:54] raye_gaming22: Realz is the DH/Rogue Dev so DHs are in good hands
[5:33:01] rivera9: horde mode off
[5:33:04] ceranac23: 2 showed zzones are great
[5:33:08] Stillelol: @ItsGigg bloodlet and dh is saved
[5:33:18] stabzmcgeee: @ItsGigg DH is buitl around borrowed power,, they have 3 expacs of that to pull from
[5:33:33] manmower: as long as The Hunt doesn't carry forward the class will be fine
[5:33:43] Sollice: Make DH armor great again
[5:33:46] Sollice: shit looks like ass
[5:33:52] stabzmcgeee: @manmower already been datamined as cming back
[5:34:10] suppstantial: I'm just coming back to WoW and having such a hard time deciding what to "main" heading into Dragonflight (I'm an altholic lol)
[5:34:11] rymerre: @manmower the Hunt was previewed months ago to be in the tree
[5:34:14] ItsGigg: Even with the borrowed power to pull from, other classes have old stuff AND borrowed power. Makes their choices slim compared to other classes
[5:34:18] HAMMERRAZOR: yea i cant use death chakram as a marksman
[5:34:26] bapele45: they should bring back hit rating and 60% speed mount for everyone lol
[5:34:37] manmower: @stabzmcgeee gonna have to make new stuff to compete with it i guess
[5:35:36] Ziddrax: none

[5:40:21] Hammatimes1: @literally_human_garbage Cheers
[5:40:39] Ooshraxa: oh, so it auto-scales
[5:40:49] Ooshraxa: wonder if it's on ilevel or char levels
[5:40:58] Mckenziehehe: when you relog the wind from dragon riding will be gone

[5:47:10] kevdot87: Ele be poopin off right now

[5:47:55] OxidTV: Hope vengeance tank will be good in DF
[5:48:05] ArcaneSyntax: @Tichigo changed a bunch of ele stuff to be better, enhance resto unchanged
[5:48:54] partycityy: @Towelliee How do you feel about the prot pally talents? And how do they feel right now on Alpha?
[5:49:08] blocasaurus_rex: whats with all the shammys
[5:50:03] Kelticlore: least the Shaman class willl be flushed out
[5:50:06] ArcaneSyntax: shaman discord having some fun
[5:50:08] jetributions: truth
[5:50:14] Architank: shaman supremacy
[5:50:16] mrelgaato: prot would be dead at that pack

[5:50:26] mrelgaato: *warior
[5:50:28] shaxxtv: why no blessed hammer?
[5:50:50] zastin586: think they need to rewrite the base spell
[5:50:50] Ooshraxa: @shaxxtv borked
[5:50:53] manmower: don't want to compile a new build just for that, just roll it into next build
[5:51:10] Quakezilla69: season 4 is next week?
[5:51:19] Kelticlore: Blizzard is saying to stop playing Paladin LOL
[5:51:22] ArcaneSyntax: enhance also has a bunch of talents that don't work,
[5:51:22] Ooshraxa: what is it... 70% of the prot tree is not working?
[5:51:54] manmower: should be giving feedback on placement of the talents
[5:52:08] Thoreya: got enough shammys in the group?
[5:52:09] Redpandalol: Multi peso company
[5:52:18] literally_human_garbage: mages could use some more time too
[5:52:21] BlewGamingGroup: there will literally be people that break down logs and send them spreadsheets to show abilities that dont work
[5:52:21] Quakezilla69: I still think the prot tree looks awesome
[5:52:22] OviTheGray: after prot, holly and ret, paladins get a 4th spec, "Broken" LUL
[5:52:24] based_takes: i mean it is the alpha
[5:52:28] jdodge1305: they seem to be taking that extra week for holy
[5:52:28] JellonaCub: I wonder if their schedules allow to take extra weeks on stuff
[5:52:28] ArcaneSyntax: I'm glad we got the talents for freedback on placement
[5:52:29] mashiesmashie: maybe the Paladin was in a better state than the remaining LUL
[5:52:31] mrmanno14: Totally agrrr
[5:52:37] Quojin: I know Sloot was really pissed about the Paladin tree
[5:52:43] manmower: sooner they get feedback on the trees the better
[5:52:46] Thoreya: so many mages are complaining about the talents that im positive theyre gonna rework that ish
[5:52:54] Ooshraxa: @mashiesmashie you're lul'ing, but I think you're right
[5:53:23] literally_human_garbage: @Thoreya blizz has been pretty good about feedback/communication for the other trees, so I'm hopeful they'll rework mage
[5:53:30] mashiesmashie: @Ooshraxa Who knows what shit show we'll get next xD
[5:53:36] McLeod25: @Quojin what was Sloot mad about?
[5:53:39] Ironhide_Gaming: Fury warriors getting destroyed in retail right now
[5:53:41] Echosapian: besides priests and ele's
[5:53:42] OviTheGray: BM hunter owns :)
[5:53:44] PvtHudson093: Justicar Vengence on the Ret tree
[5:53:45] enux337: they cant screw up mages and pallies
[5:53:49] ArcaneSyntax: the enhance discord is so used to being shit on they reflexively think the tree is bad
[5:53:50] rymerre: whats wrong with the mage trees?
[5:53:52] DeanoTV: People are never gonna be happy even if they chage
[5:53:59] bwoods79: Alot of people forget to think about how the talents are going to scale with gear
[5:54:08] Quojin: what Toweliee jst said
[5:54:11] blocasaurus_rex: atleast you have a tree, monks are stuck in Shadowlands
[5:54:17] Emperor_Kuzco16: @rymere1983 a shorter list would be "whats right with the mage trees"
[5:54:19] Ooshraxa: @mashiesmashie probably warriors? They seem to want to release tanks
[5:54:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having the stuff working would help their case
[5:54:21] TakkaZJ2: Rogue trees make my heart full
[5:54:23] Echosapian: i don't think blizzard is gonna bring back DF for mage, that'd be too nice to their player base
[5:54:31] manmower: they'll probably rebalance talents between patches, gonna be fun to change your builds as they patch
[5:54:32] literally_human_garbage: it's less about scaling because that's just numbers. it's about the layout of the trees and the talents available. synergy and all that
[5:54:32] 91Niki: Don't jinx it!!!!
[5:54:36] LootFeverTV: right xD
[5:54:37] Nicstar1007: Nobody play Evoker. Evoker dead already

[5:54:42] DarkFinalTears: Are yall talking about the next expansions trees?
[5:54:43] smashwow: oh they could and they will be
[5:54:48] 91Niki: Now you jinxed it Towelliee
[5:54:50] dewking93: is hunter out yet?
[5:55:00] LootFeverTV: because monks have a long history of being good right? xD
[5:55:01] tastytictacs: lol, people only played evoker for the first 2 weeks
[5:55:03] ArcaneSyntax: hey maybe the fact that we haven't gotten DH or monk means their boring raid buffs are going away
[5:55:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Evoker healer is pretty badass, apart from the limited range
[5:55:05] tristanrhyan98: yes
[5:55:07] Ooshraxa: @dewking93 has been for a while. BM doing great.
[5:55:09] MrFuzzynuts420: evoker doing way more dps than frost mage at the moment
[5:55:10] McLeod25: Ret has some interesting synergies, so I'm happy there
[5:55:12] DarkFinalTears: Could someone fill me in on which trees yall are talking about?
[5:55:13] manmower: yea PVPers are probably the big winners with talent trees
[5:55:14] Mecabeast: blizz says hold my beer
[5:55:15] scottb0tt: both evoker specs look cracked
[5:55:24] Mitune: Little worried about Monk trees now

[6:05:29] kulriko: ret pallies have two fundamental issues, one is aoe vs st, you can't have both most of the time
[6:05:41] 91Niki: @Rhite It's early alpha. Too early to tell what will be bis and what won't
[6:05:44] kulriko: and the second is that they are not worth bringing to raid for optimal play
[6:05:56] K3ks112: wasnt holy shield the block thingy?
[6:05:56] kulriko: they have no raid buff, nothing that would make them better than holy or prot
[6:06:01] stabzmcgeee: @Rhite they dont even have all classes in alpha yet,, they wont have looked at tuning so untill launch day no one knows
[6:06:15] nephttv_: yoyo

[6:18:15] 91Niki: @stabzmcgeee Yeah the amount of ignorance definitely shines through. Probably mostly people who don't understand how game development works.
[6:18:33] scumlucki: Is there a way to buy a 2handed sword i need one for me arms
[6:18:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Are they keeping Elysian Decree for DH tank, that's a question

[6:24:57] LootFeverTV: yes
[6:25:02] Horseweave: Wait, no CAP?
[6:25:06] Mecabeast: 15s drop 262 currently so I would guess 290s in s4 so vault will get you over 300
[6:25:10] rivera9: 1st time lego LOWER than max ilvl
[6:25:15] rivera9: o.O

[6:26:55] UltiCarnagee: Veng DHs are the worst for Out-ranging their Heals KEKW
[6:26:57] Horseweave: So... is it better to go Raiding for Gear?
[6:27:02] SpoofAvatar: they should increase the non AOE healing spells to 40 yd range
[6:27:06] dantezalive: they just have to position better
[6:27:08] Woodland_Critter: The 25 range is going to make them pretty rough in both dungeons and raids.
[6:27:12] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee So the class that can fly, can't catch up to the tanks that are running on foot? Kappa
[6:27:13] burnsie5511: evoker should just position themself infront
[6:27:14] CasualR: @Towelliee at least evokers have a "now tank, sit over here please" button lol.
[6:27:15] Horseweave: Or do M+?
[6:27:19] nesman27: "i have evoker please be patient" Kappa

[6:29:24] Ultratoasted: So I believe those eggs turn into whelps when stepped on.
[6:29:25] Dystilled: Evoker probably going to be better in raids where setups are more set
[6:29:34] 91Niki: @wulftrn It's early alpha? LUL wut
[6:29:53] troeffle: @wulftrn Was thinking the same lmao
[6:30:01] troeffle: about it being alpha
[6:30:16] wulftrn: eh, we will see
[6:30:39] theoriginalzinng: evoker just has a high skill cap imo
[6:30:39] stabzmcgeee: @91Niki ok can the command just be "the fuck you mean, its alpha"
[6:31:01] SpoofAvatar: many whelps, handle it

[6:33:41] SpoofAvatar: omg
[6:34:39] blooodraine: dah fuck is that frence talking or something?

[6:36:13] Architank: but healing is so easy because you don't have to dps Kappa
[6:36:13] PhrykeFinn: I think blue build requires more work than red build
[6:36:13] enux337: monkaS  pvp healing evoker
[6:36:16] notColt45: No, Blizzard says it's advanced!
[6:36:18] ncatter: @Horuseternal69 The news for it on battlenet seems to indicate that it stops at S4 "Don’t delay. The winds will shift once more with the start of Shadowlands Season 4, and the experience buff will no longer be available."
[6:36:19] Robodope: i can see healing evokers yelling about ranged dps positioning

[6:36:59] enux337: ill save you *gets snared* oof
[6:37:40] Architank: I wonder if you could build the evoker DPS as a hybrid and off heal other dps members in raid to ease up the burden of the main healers
[6:38:31] Coriollis: every single drakanoid, drake , dragon is beefy, only the player is a soy dragon Pepehand
[6:38:41] vodox19: @Towelliee are you still playing the beta for Dragon?
[6:39:01] Rabiahtaro132: Do you think evoker would be better if they changed some of the DPS passive to abilities that give the same bonuses?
[6:39:05] 5ixer: Had an Evoker healer doing 5k DPS with just living flame spam
[6:39:07] lolgiff: ..
[6:39:11] Hawkzerr: @vodox19 Hes still playing Alpha
[6:39:17] slimoby: @vodox19 the alpha for dragonflight? yes
[6:39:25] Horuseternal69: @Horuseternal69 Yeah seems that way, it's the classic one that is lasting longer my aplogies. that one is 6-8 weeks worth of it
[6:39:28] UltiCarnagee: It's like killing the Shards of Halkias in Halls
[6:39:33] vodox19: @hawkzerr Thank you that is what i was talking about i apologize for the incorrect word
[6:39:52] Hawkzerr: @vodox19 All good I know what you ment :D
[6:40:23] iRumm: Think Frenzied Regen should be off the gcd?
[6:40:29] shaxxtv: just spam moonfire like in legion! gogogo
[6:40:56] Hawkzerr: @Towelliee What do you think of Shadowpriests in Alpha?
[6:40:56] vodox19: @Towelliee I always wonder when you play alpha for a existing game does it possibly kill the fun for you on release?
[6:40:58] scumlucki: How the fuck do these scam callers get my number?
[6:41:09] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee the healing done log will be interesting
[6:41:37] 91Niki: @STK_Lucki If you buy anything where your phone number is required, odds are they got it from there. Either via hacking or the place just selling info lol
[6:41:52] scumlucki: @STK_Lucki This is insane
[6:42:02] Ultratoasted: Watch the healer be mega blasting and they're just messin the dungeon up.
[6:42:19] Rocx7604: !wotlk plans
[6:42:20] Moobot: @Rocx7604 Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!

[6:42:42] notColt45: interrupt no do dmg
[6:42:45] TheUnknowing: who needs interrupts Kappa
[6:42:45] UltiCarnagee: This is a preview of what's gonna happen in M+ in DF KEKW
[6:42:53] wulftrn: I hate that lol, everyone has a interrupt but no one uses it lol
[6:42:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW Dragonflight Guardian Druid Gameplay youtu.be/Tg7IiAGklfs
[6:42:55] 91Niki: @STK_Lucki Best you can do is block and ignore. Don't pick up or hit the busy button, cuz that indicates the phone is in use
[6:43:00] UltiCarnagee: Interrupt? Who has interrupt in the group Kappa
[6:43:00] CloudPants8081: atpRtsd
[6:43:00] TheBroCrow: Interrupt? I don't have that in my spellbook
[6:43:13] funnyc4t: What is interrupt? Never seen that on live either
[6:43:13] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:43:25] stoowu: I mean that reflects how it works today.  People have them, they just don't use them.
[6:43:27] looney199725: bro il be pre checking ppl and kicking if no kicks
[6:43:27] wulftrn: True, as a tank I always interrupt KEKW
[6:43:30] fIuff: atpSuspect
[6:43:31] notColt45: You'll take the interrupt and still do top dmg most likely in Pugs
[6:43:34] PhrykeFinn: everyone should take interrupt in M+
[6:43:39] TheBroCrow: LFM +20 Ruby Pools, inspecting for interrupt KEKW
[6:43:40] Texas_Mizfit: bring rogues cause they have kick baseline
[6:43:41] dutrockbridge: What's an interrupt?  KEKW
[6:43:48] TheCornRatsss: having interrupt as healer will be sweet :P
[6:43:52] Exikos: sp will be at good spot for interutps :D
[6:43:56] Coriollis: interrupt doesn't appear on dps recount 🤔
[6:44:04] Lostdogal: just pug with me, interrupt is literally the only thing I'm good at lol
[6:44:06] funnyc4t: wait, you actually need to spec into interrupt in DF?
[6:44:11] hammack52: i mean they could just make the interup base line for all classes again instead of specced, that way noone can say i didnt take it
[6:44:14] Ooshraxa: gimme that dragon for dragonriding
[6:44:21] looney199725: some classes ye
[6:44:29] looney199725: boomie having double kick tho is pog
[6:44:31] Denarianx: @funnyc4t its a talent for some classes
[6:44:52] strike879: anyone know if you can fall off?
[6:44:56] zgag: If the group outgeared the dungeon than interrupts aren't really needed.  Otherwise they should be required
[6:44:58] raldrik: can you inspect to see what someone is specked?
[6:45:00] funnyc4t: rip, pugging gonna be even more fun then :D
[6:45:05] ratfurian: is it only streamers in the alpha or actually also some lucky ''normal'' players?
[6:45:07] TheUnknowing: every one gets it so yeah, would want to stack somewhere
[6:45:08] lalelusa: can you dragonfly in there? looks like the perfect perch for take off
[6:45:27] Texas_Mizfit: when dragon is on the ground you should focus him and not the dragonrider
[6:45:34] nephttv_: well we all died 1000 times at the start lmfao
[6:45:38] hasan666: ass dmg

[6:45:53] Horuseternal69: that poor shadow priest lol
[6:46:05] Hawkzerr: Jeez is the SP as a whole is just bad or the player was bad?
[6:46:05] Coriollis: so the priest was the healer Kappa
[6:46:17] DiiscoViking: ouch my dps was crap
[6:46:44] Horuseternal69: shadow feel that bad right now diisco?
[6:46:54] Morasch01: i thought pyre was a DPS only ability?
[6:47:02] j_bar111: @DiiscoViking more mindflay on single target
[6:47:02] DiiscoViking: no its great i was just worried about off healing
[6:47:05] nephttv_: ill brb homie, gotta get some morning food

[6:48:09] shaxxtv: basic tree
[6:48:13] shaxxtv: under curse remove
[6:48:16] Hawkzerr: I wish they would not allow like recount or damage meters in the game you have to go to the log to see.
[6:48:43] looney199725: because you dont want ppl to see your dps be low?
[6:48:49] looney199725: dps meters are a good thing
[6:49:01] looney199725: lets you know whos slacking
[6:49:28] ZuggSpeedman: also allows you to improve
[6:49:31] RiptoreCA: Level 70 POG champ
[6:49:38] funnyc4t: Just make details/recount not show during combat, and it will popup after
[6:49:45] Kulture1: dps meters are fine, logs are stupid
[6:49:52] Alepouditsa: danLove
[6:49:56] looney199725: there both fine
