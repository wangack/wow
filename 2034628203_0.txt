[0:42:00] itsthelichqueen: People not having Shroud of Survival on Nzoth
[0:42:10] HarmlessCurse: On fyrakk people will not dispell on CD and they tank him in the middle of the arena
[0:42:26] HarmlessCurse: they can not have enough dps to break his shield
[0:42:51] Harleybane: @HarmlessCurse there's no right or wrong in lfr, there's only the kill way
[0:42:54] Petarglio: That would have been infinitely better
[0:43:00] クロニアス: @Maximum Anyway you can share Plater profile? I updated to new Atrocity, I enjoyed the older one better
[0:43:04] holtrop: that would make ALOT more sense
[0:43:04] Petarglio: They were way too obsessed this tier with random assignments
[0:43:22] DenYami: Hi, No twitch drop available yet for new patch release ?

[0:43:57] Oracle_WoW: make the balls zig zag and move 20% faster.
[0:44:00] LeSnapcasteur: or one person died and gets assigned and doesnt call for backup
[0:44:02] LOLdotCOM: the difficulty is the same, just one is marginally harder cause you're pushing a button. that's a silly reason for it to be harder, just go with your suggestion and its fixed
[0:44:02] tanikins: The accidental presses are KILLER

[0:45:06] beels189: @Maximum gotta line it up with world quest week
[0:45:08] sarkaas_: what did they delay ?
[0:45:20] DeadBesidE: @Maximum decrease pick orb damage by 33% and make it 4 sets of orbs w/o stacks and problem solved imo
[0:45:20] oneifbyland: shareholder metrics YEP
[0:45:24] DenYami: ok np thx for answezr
[0:45:28] Squats3: yeah if anything this week would be the best week to do a drop
[0:45:29] tanikins: i mean race is different, but patch is smaller. try to hold those viewers
[0:45:29] Sabre070: Honestly they should have reduced the orbs (like 2/3) and made it so you only soak one orb then get a diff color (short cd), maybe add a 3rd color. Just make it dynamic, so you have to go out and soak orbs
[0:45:31] cennlol: what are you doing in Algethar 🤔?
[0:45:33] Squats3: new content and a drop

[0:46:52] DeadBesidE: ironforge Pog
[0:46:52] Sabre070: Not going in with debuffs would work if the orbs moved positions, like purple ones moved from middle to left or right, so you needed to swap around your positioning still
[0:46:52] cronvix: youre a prime time waster i love it hahahaha
[0:46:54] reggiepowa: new dh hunt animation

[0:56:19] tchikaboom: read your buffs
[0:56:19] Sha_GB: its meant to be slower yeh idk why
[0:56:19] SparrowONE: 85% speed yes, but smaller zones, so feels the same.
[0:56:19] jmo99_: the zones are too small compared
[0:56:22] nairb1: ride abroad buff top right
[0:56:22] Rhoncer: smaller maps
[0:56:22] stronhammer: ITs still faster
[0:56:23] Cycore: because old world is so small
[0:56:24] Pyrrha_GG: zones smol
[0:56:24] t0romak: cause maps are smaller
[0:56:24] Havocados: For pet farming I suppose

[0:56:55] miraagex: i want to fly from Darkshore to Vortex Pinnacle in 5 sec wtf blizzard
[0:56:56] Lexxury: if it's too fast, just remove it ICANT
[0:56:58] ColdIceCreamMan: they said in an interview at blizzcon that they had issues with zones not being able to load that fast in the old world
[0:57:01] c3rby_: I believe it slows down but during races in the old world it’s back to full speed
[0:57:03] Trodenskjold: Max gonna end up flying around for an hour and food gonna be hella cold
[0:57:08] mongo11b: therealbigmongo converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:57:09] Sabre070: Processing new areas if you blitzed through them too fast can be a bad experience too
[0:57:12] daiger5o: Food getting cold

[0:58:52] dhammatheo: the crust is amazing - get out of here haha
[0:59:02] Lexxury: what's the point of Spectral Sight in terms of using it in endgame content?
[0:59:07] itsthelichqueen: My awful stream of Heroic Amirdrassil when you were not there can be awful content to watch spaced46Lichmane

[0:59:58] AngryStapler: garf
[0:59:59] alejandro7com: @Drax_1224 court of stars is so 2023, get with the times bro
[1:00:01] Disect: that would've been legendary beans
[1:00:04] glitsmonk: are you gonna try out some palworld?
[1:00:04] Nickystr1x: i thought it was a cool idea but obviously absolute piss to play with
[1:00:18] Squats3: having to slow down to a walk to use an ability in combat would be beans.
[1:00:19] nightst314: north
[1:00:20] MemphisGamingTTV: Sounds cool for class aesthetic, but for game play that sounds awful
[1:00:20] Gamerhcp: north

[1:00:44] Trodenskjold: The cave to winterspring i guess

[1:01:14] Archmage_Michael: New Tuning in the title!? what was tuned ?

[1:01:28] Mealkey: cause pet battlers
[1:01:29] Jjmn12: because you are not riding
[1:01:34] Squats3: @Maximum because of mount runs and pet battles. remember?
[1:01:34] Keefie: @Maximum any MW monk ui's you'd reccomend?>
[1:01:36] Richthofen187: was i the only one asking that question at the beginning of the expac?
[1:01:38] Armostallion: unironically pet battles KEKW
[1:01:38] PizzaDlvBoy: They were worried people would like it

[1:02:27] Lalla1584: @Maximum isnt it gonna "dismount" you in the tunnel
[1:02:29] Discard_TV: Soar wasn't dragonriding because they felt it was an unfair advantage in the old world.  Now that it's dragonriding everywhere, it was a no brainer to revert that.
[1:02:30] nightst314: speeds are probably too high in general
[1:02:31] Nickystr1x: gary gapped
[1:02:52] Menethrill: KEKW

[1:06:30] MVPBuster: sanguine is so manageable now its honestly fine
[1:06:34] gizmo385: "everyone"  *sobs in warrior*
[1:06:36] DZEJK_xD: bursting is the worst imo
[1:06:37] Jimmo24: incorp is trash because of cast times

[1:09:35] taanzfour: it isn't as bad as ppl think it is but it aint boomkin
[1:09:36] eveecat: maybe unpopular opinion but holy priest should be higher than D
[1:09:36] oneifbyland: @Slyfire 1) do the Gilneas questline  2) explore the non-instanced World tree area 3) old world dragonriding
[1:09:37] Its_Big_Tone: lopl
[1:09:40] jobbw: its more like a popularity list right?

[1:09:46] Cherparrots: Same reason as Shadow priest last week
[1:09:46] c3rby_: I’ve yet to see a shadow high end
[1:09:46] Nox1o: its based on popularity
[1:09:47] scorgie1994: top healers can play disc better than mw#
[1:09:47] OG_Kawngi: it's based on completed keys from 22-31
[1:09:47] Yungpupperz: revival > MD
[1:09:50] Its_Big_Tone: yes
[1:09:50] Sinergy_57: mass dispell bursting week
[1:09:50] xSamuraiMKx: you are looking at the affix week

[1:09:58] MrChaCho: on bursting week, maybe
[1:09:58] Pa1ntank: it's for that specific week
[1:09:58] Sohen: @Maximum you are looking at tier list for bursting week only, so priests will be higher
[1:09:58] OG_Kawngi: yes
[1:10:00] sterlingrad: if mass dispell was so good then why holy priest so low?
[1:10:01] Metalburnie: tiers are based on appearances in keys, not votings or so
[1:10:01] Its_Big_Tone: if coordinated yes its huge
[1:10:02] jentboom: based on logs from +22-+31
[1:10:02] Sover31gn: Although revival is the same cd
[1:10:03] Sohen: yes
[1:10:03] brizz3: you didnt do keys last week lol
[1:10:03] Hred5: yes
[1:10:03] malnourish_: yes ez
[1:10:03] taanzfour: PI+ damage is lot more than mistweaver
[1:10:04] jinglebegood: no, rather % of players playing high keys
[1:10:04] spivet: its only runs for bursting week so yes absolutely
[1:10:04] rosstherosstrich: @Maximum Bursting is the PUG killer
[1:10:05] nightmayor12: 100%
[1:10:06] xSamuraiMKx: yes
[1:10:06] feelzman: no
[1:10:06] EmilBaand: based on data so What is played is What is reflected there
[1:10:09] Mattefofan: nope
[1:10:11] Tippolski: MW can revival wtf
[1:10:11] Therealbrokensword: if you click the details arrow it shows the highest key complete by each spec, which is better imo
[1:10:11] RealApexPredator: change affixes and see
[1:10:12] dragonprayer789: MD and revival are the same level, Revival arguably better because instant cast
[1:10:13] owenq99: no
[1:10:13] xSamuraiMKx: for certain dungeons 100%
[1:10:15] Nox1o: revival > md
[1:10:16] scorgie1994: fort buff too
[1:10:16] mcphatty: mass dispel/more dmg/PI for mage or lock
[1:10:18] Skwatch: MF can also Dispell every 3min
[1:10:20] Its_Big_Tone: on bursting week its on CD/big pull
[1:10:21] BurtikShaun: aint no way you are powering through 20 stacks
[1:10:24] ohfoeshow: its based on logs so its based on keys done
[1:10:24] sleepyboycody: ig you'd rather have a disc than a shadow. idk
[1:10:24] brizz3: for 15 stack everybloom pulls you want md
[1:10:24] Biviter: I was watching some people who do low 20s last week and they were complaining about bursting a lot.
[1:10:25] gizmo385: @sterlingrad holy is just weaker than disc for keys more generally other reasons
[1:10:26] Yungpupperz: MD being better than revival is a bad take
[1:10:26] cajovysacok: i can outheal bursting as MW
[1:10:29] OG_Kawngi: MW+spriest
[1:10:30] c3rby_: for this weak prob
[1:10:30] daiger5o: Most people dont know they will just invite the priest
[1:10:32] Papi_Tai: it shows the sample size above the s tier and the key range
[1:10:34] Khorvan: rdruid and mw can heal bursting without md really well though
[1:10:36] Gunnolfz: more people play priest
[1:10:38] Euphoria_wow: MW and Rshamman can heal through 5+ burst, Priest is S tier for how free Mass is for the less skilled
[1:10:40] Slapsstick: no one except me plays mistweaver in my group but im also our tank so we make the priest heal LUL
[1:10:41] tumbro: rsham c tier this data set is scuffed
[1:10:42] クロニアス: @Therealbrokensword He's watching a video. He can't do that
[1:10:44] ZEEnitrofx: based on 15500 runs
[1:10:47] Varae__: it's just one more weight on the scale toward disc, all 3 of those healers crank
[1:10:48] TheCJrose1234: what is this website?
[1:10:49] AmidAiz: Madge must kill one more
[1:10:49] Guko97: pug dps never stop damage
[1:10:50] Darkshore_Capital: EXTEND
[1:10:50] Lindorn_: YEP
[1:10:53] Its_Big_Tone: cant control the power
[1:10:55] Nickystr1x: i think thats just you, bud
[1:10:55] MortsyFGC: Call of the void
[1:10:55] c3rby_: actually mass dispel can’t be that great cuz holy is still d tier
[1:10:55] feelzman: 100% true
[1:10:55] goodoption: i love to roll
[1:10:56] Artheeri: it's like pulling out a thorn real fast
[1:10:56] MortsyFGC: lmao
[1:10:59] Glowerss: It's PI and damage mostly. But the data is basically how many people are playing the spec + what the highest completed keys for that spec are. Disc would have had the most people running it and completing the highest keys
[1:10:59] Sinergy_57: YEP
[1:10:59] moash_: Good luck living a pack with 20 bursting stacks when the pack dies as disc
[1:11:00] luxumbra69: speaking from experience? degenerate.
[1:11:05] Therealbrokensword: @クロニアス indeed haha
[1:11:06] sdjfn: it just feels good when it pops
[1:11:07] Jamiryo: its been ranking due to Logs on M+ that weeks for related data sets. Higher completion on higher ranks classes ranks up in tier list. Ex: The most the population of logs of m+ that week disc was topping the % of the logs
[1:11:07] Ionized4: how else is the healer supposed to farm bursting clips on twitch
[1:11:10] dragonprayer789: Did a 12 stack extendo this week and LIVED
[1:11:11] pinkbox: amen
[1:11:16] TooTubular: bursting makes me want to time all the mobs to die at once
[1:11:17] whspe: any class tuning at all? @Maximum
[1:11:18] taanzfour: imma watch a 30 sec ad for u
[1:11:20] taanzfour: yw
[1:11:21] beels189: @Maximum my key says bolstering not bursting
[1:11:25] c3rby_: I fucken love it
[1:11:26] VelouriaVR: I was able to time all my 20 of fort at 20 as hpally last week
[1:11:30] Nox1o: best part about bursting in weekly 20s is that defensives dont exist yet
[1:11:30] Khorvan: healed a 16 stack as rdruid at one point lol
[1:11:35] OG_Kawngi: anyone else's 7tv messed up
[1:11:35] Mokry_kek: healer mechanic who cares
[1:11:48] Driney: healed a 4 stack on my pally once
[1:11:48] Slyfire: There it is ! Healer affix confirmed
[1:11:49] sleepyboycody: healing bursting is so fuckin fun bruh idk why some healers hate it
[1:11:55] miraagex: @OG_Kawngi it didnt work for me for like 30min and seems to be fine now
[1:12:02] not_emitv: not_emitv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:12:05] Khorvan: @sleepyboycody so true
[1:12:09] AngryStapler: for sure using them at all
[1:12:11] SirPikajew: @driney so brave of you
[1:12:12] Reydien: proactive use of minor defensives makes such a big difference
[1:12:15] goekenaitor: goekenaitor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[1:12:20] eveecat: correct
[1:12:24] Nox1o: ive had a 3.4k mage in a waycrest manor that managed to never use alter time. Not ONCE in an entire key
[1:12:26] Nox1o: like wth
[1:12:27] scorgie1994: installing omnicd in pugs is depressing lol
[1:12:30] dragonprayer789: a lot of people use Defensives reactionly, after the point they already needed them, if they used it at all
[1:12:32] Nox1o: so many easy alters
[1:12:33] silent_tv1: ellesmere has this for monk and its crazy
[1:12:35] mcphatty: FoTM mages are terrorist in the lvl 20 key range because they dont use any of their defensives
[1:12:35] luxumbra69: @Driney the 2nd time it happened, you let the group die because you couldnt handle it :)
[1:12:43] Reydien: dps warriors that press spell reflect less than 10 times a dungeon, SMH :(
[1:12:45] DasBull_XD: ellesmere did it
[1:12:49] TheEyeVII: pvers are awful at using defensives
[1:12:51] Mokry_kek: wall at 20% hp 5Head
[1:12:53] Reydien: should basically be on CD
[1:12:57] AJbgodx: wlogs should do parses for dmg reducted/prevented
[1:13:01] freehawk1: you don't need to use your defensives until like >+22 LOL
[1:13:02] jadow7: jadow7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:13:02] Kobaaya: it actualy depends on how bad your pug healer is
[1:13:03] mcphatty: Ellesmere wont release it though
[1:13:05] sossi96: @sleepyboycody depends on which healer I am! rdruid? gimme all the stack I got this… disc and all mobs dead? not so nice 😂
[1:13:07] swaseytv: wa already say “use personally”
[1:13:09] RayWoz: good players find spots to use defensives. bad players save it for emergencies
[1:13:11] nick08_wow: shiny thing i press
[1:13:13] Yungpupperz: Ellesmere has a private WA for just that
[1:13:16] DisorganizedWizardsClub: DisorganizedWizardsClub subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[1:13:28] Byggareebob: thats such a shit take tho should always use defensives
[1:13:31] Guko97: frontals
[1:13:32] ZEEnitrofx: @ellesmere
[1:13:38] laetuss: shouldn't you learn good habbits on lower keys tho?
[1:13:44] Varae__: plenty of people time all of their 20s without defensives bound
[1:13:44] Nox1o: problem is this season you gotta press it before damage comes, so that weakaura needs to be based on incoming mechanics/cast
[1:13:47] Shmith90: @TheEyeVII got it also to hear from my pvp friend and then learned it =)
[1:13:50] xSamuraiMKx: this is why people are ass in a 22 right now
[1:13:53] MortsyFGC: Damn Destro kinda pumping in storming bursting?
[1:13:53] BizzlexJB: yeah, but not everyone is i lvl 485 so u do need defensives lower than 22
[1:13:53] KillUAssie: people don’t understand what their character can do
[1:13:58] Hred5: the real habit is the friends we make along the way
[1:14:03] luxumbra69: people die to running out of defensives in 20's when they use them ASAP instead of using them for dangerous overlaps.
[1:14:05] AngryStapler: its hard to learn in lower keys. nothing does anything so you learn to never press anything
[1:14:10] dithrica: @MortsyFGC in everbloom at least lol
[1:14:12] KillUAssie: yesterday I had a priest who didn’t know to mass dispel
[1:14:13] Sinergy_57: Depends on the player though if they are doing +10s there gear is probably shit and will die to those mechanics that you wont die to
[1:14:17] Nox1o: @BizzlexJB a fresh char can be 485 in like a week
[1:14:19] JukeboxHey: Also people doing +10 have worse gear so for some grps it is comperable to doing a 22
[1:14:34] Hred5: yes he knows
[1:14:35] sossi96: @nox1o you always wanna press def before dmg comes lol?
[1:14:37] miraagex: @luxumbra69 i raid with guild but pug m+. i never trust healers in m+ and always only counting on myself
[1:14:38] Ionized4: there's no data for this week
[1:14:41] gizmo385: @laetuss Hard to reinforce those habits in a lower key when the damage is negligible
[1:14:42] spivet: this week has no data
[1:14:43] Its_Big_Tone: it takes 24 hours after mait to update wit new data
[1:14:43] TirrinWoW: subcreation doesnt update until the next day
[1:14:50] MortsyFGC: @AnySteph12 I just assumed Demo was also superior
[1:14:51] cajovysacok: in eu we have still no reset
[1:14:52] JukeboxHey: @Nox1o Not if u cant do 20s
[1:14:52] Keyvi_: whats that site showing the tier lists=?
[1:14:55] AngryStapler: doing 22+ is easier than a random pug 6
[1:14:56] MortsyFGC: always*
[1:14:57] AngryStapler: 16
[1:14:59] Twismero: The thing is that defensive don't take any of your global usually to press. So just press it even if it's lower than a 22.
[1:15:09] Nox1o: @sossi96 im talking about his suggestion of a weakaura, couldnt be an easy low health trigger stuff
[1:15:15] TooTubular: His hand in hair ability is always on CD
[1:15:43] Nox1o: @TooTubular thats off gcd, he does it while doing other stuff e.g talking
[1:15:48] ColdIceCreamMan: my tank always plays bear so this never matters for us KEKW
[1:15:48] destrominater: @maximum do you think there’s a world where Bizarro Tettles would be bald?
[1:15:56] sossi96: @nox1o can base it on boss timers or when targeted
[1:16:01] dithrica: @MortsyFGC i haven't seen it played outside of everbloom last week, but it SLAPS in EB. not sure why it's ranked higher than demo tho
[1:16:11] feelzman: It will every time will be prot pally because their overloaded utility
[1:16:11] TooTubular: @Nox1o True xD
[1:16:12] alejandro7com: **Haha, the real habit is the friends we make along the way**
[1:16:20] AngryStapler: prot pally better in pugs.
[1:16:31] elysona: meanwhile me,.... a prot war main still waiting for some utility
[1:16:32] TheCJrose1234: yay frost dk dogshit as usual!
[1:16:40] Alarius_: prots shouldnt have ret aura
[1:16:42] Fendrixs: tier lists Deadge
[1:16:44] feelzman: Other tanks have to be beyond broken like S2 Bear to even compete
[1:16:45] luxumbra69: FDK is so sadge rn.
[1:16:46] kazetag: Im a gigachad outlaw
[1:16:48] ColdIceCreamMan: i hate playing outlaw. sin is so much for fun
[1:16:56] dhammatheo: BASED
[1:16:56] Kenpachi724: outlaw is hard??? its easy as hell??
[1:16:57] AngryStapler: feral F tier? no way
[1:17:02] Holyjudgee: normal rogue yes JPC on rogue no
[1:17:02] Slensch: if rouge doesnt quit that is
[1:17:02] Nox1o: when I see yoda starting to play crit wings for damage in 30+ keys, i dont think it matters that vdh is tankier
[1:17:02] taanzfour: rogue is giga tanki
[1:17:03] d0mezg4mer: hard to compare when outlaw is so hard you don't see many playing to it's full potential
[1:17:04] Asuo_: outlaw also has a serious RNG mechanic
[1:17:09] Fendrixs: they have netherwalk, vers trinkets, blur, darkness, leech
[1:17:12] Kobaaya: if you aligne your rolls properly your god
[1:17:15] Archmage_Michael: Do you think there will be some dungeon tuning before MDI?
[1:17:19] Darkshore_Capital: outlaw is real unforgiving too
[1:17:20] miraagex: outlaw is one of the hardest specs to follow APL 100% accurately
[1:17:20] SeraphimSentinel: No spec in wow is actually hard to play
[1:17:24] breadwilton: @kazetag who asked
[1:17:24] Aveeeeek: @Kenpachi724 show logs
[1:17:25] sdjfn: outlaw is not easy at all
[1:17:26] erdls: outlaw is easy to play hard to do good dmg
[1:17:32] luxumbra69: @Kobaaya properly lmao.
[1:17:32] conchelobe: Haven't played in a while and tried outlaw thos seapn. Very fast lol
[1:17:33] AngryStapler: @SeraphimSentinel besides BM hunter Kapp
[1:17:34] toique: how the hell is moonkin living high keys and not havoc
[1:17:35] 501glizzy: why my boy affliction warlock in f tier PoroSad
[1:17:37] miraagex: @Aveeeeek ICANT
[1:17:40] SeraphimSentinel: @AngryStapler True Kapp
[1:17:42] sdjfn: it has on of the highest top ends ever
[1:17:45] Nox1o: outlaw has a huge dmg gap based on skill, more than prob all other classes
[1:17:47] cimer_chef: sub rogue should be higher
[1:17:49] hyeheal: says the balance druid lmao
[1:17:50] c3rby_: outlaw is an RSI giver
[1:17:52] sleepyboycody: yeah and its not even close
[1:17:52] Kenpachi724: been playing combat/outlaw since WolK, so maybe grandfathered knowledge, play?
[1:17:52] erdls: yes exactl
[1:17:53] slash9211_: Using hekili on outlaw is wild haha. Feels like through the fire and flames on guitar hero 3
[1:17:58] gutz101: thats with every class though
[1:18:01] Kingstarkz6: Outlaw you miss one thing and lose 30% damage
[1:18:02] IcyIceCreamTruck: Look mum my class sucks the most. Cries in Affliction
[1:18:07] Pokamoo: whats the main part of it that makes you feel that way about outlaw
[1:18:10] Mimorial: Outlaw has a lot of fluctuations though with BtE resets. You can just get gimped if you roll bad on that
[1:18:14] sleepyboycody: Apm is so much more relevant on outlaw i feel
[1:18:17] 501glizzy: is this a pve tier list?
[1:18:17] Khorvan: @501glizzy it's not bad, the other two are just better, so people play those instead in high keys
[1:18:20] sdjfn: Jpc literally gaps people with over 100k to other rogues
[1:18:20] larkhill: ret's skill ceiling is about 2ft off the ground
[1:18:22] luxumbra69: @toique bear. effective HP pool. blur isnt up often enough for some dmg profiles.
[1:18:24] JBugaboo: if you die running Keep it rolling ur damaged is cooked for 2 minutes
[1:18:28] ColdIceCreamMan: @slash9211_ outlaw has so many procs that playing with an addon like that makes it seriously harder
[1:18:29] pissbeliever: YEP
[1:18:33] alejandro7com: Haha, watching these rogues argue about tiers is like trying to stealth through a room full of murlocs – entertaining chaos!
[1:18:34] amincks: amincks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:18:40] jolsh_dtd: i hate playing DH now
[1:18:43] Official_sMiLe: People think outlaw is easy because they don't know it got reworked
[1:18:45] tanikins: I used to recommend DH for new melee players
[1:18:46] Asuo_: Like you can't say the skill ceiling of like BM is near the same as Fire or Outlaw
[1:18:46] Archmage_Michael: @slash9211_ I use Hekili on every class/spec I want to learn. gives you a good basline understanding on what to do
[1:18:47] c3rby_: it’s not with every class bm hunter exists
[1:18:47] Nox1o: dh still has a VERY high floor, if you press everythin on cd you do most of your dmg
[1:18:51] Slensch: best dh ever
[1:18:52] M0nkeys: @larkhill Yet certain top rets are doing far more damage than the average ret
[1:18:53] slash9211_: @ColdIceCreamMan 100%, I do it cause I'm lazy
[1:18:55] 501glizzy: what makes destruction lock so much better than other 2 specs?
[1:18:56] toxicthunberg: enhance is so squishy.. thats why its C
[1:18:58] Alarius_: PISS
[1:18:59] miraagex: Putting Lashing Flames on all mobs so booring Madge
[1:19:02] kani_cs: @Maximum u got some updates from james ? is he really done with keys again ? was so good to watch him play outlaw
[1:19:06] shadwosw: tbh malees are ez except enhance and outlow imo
[1:19:06] deviljin____: People who didn't play current Outlaw don't have knowledge for proper standards on what hard is
[1:19:16] Kawatteruwow: bring back bfa dh
[1:19:24] Archmage_Michael: DH isn't easy since DF. you have a lot of buttons comapred to most classes
[1:19:25] 16attempts: I, as a dh player, feel like the hard part of mastering dh is just knowing how to move, and position yourself to not die to shit. Also staying in melee so much and not running out with ur ragefire
[1:19:26] Slayen84: @Kawatteruwow THIS
[1:19:29] LainedTV: @deviljin____ This is so true, there's a lot more going on for it now
[1:19:30] holtrop: people who say dh is easy just havent played it since 8.3
[1:19:30] malnourish_: this digging activity is BEANS omg
[1:19:31] JBugaboo: bugaunless you're at jpc's level or 200 io within him you're probably an avg outlaw
[1:19:32] Virelo: its easy at the floor level big diff to floor and ceiling tho
[1:19:32] sdjfn: If you say outlaw is easy it just shows that you don't know how to actually play it really well
[1:19:34] Slapsstick: outlaw is the hardest rogue spec for me by far, i dont like it and i cant play it well at all
[1:19:46] miraagex: @sdjfn +++
[1:19:56] sleepyboycody: bring it back..
[1:19:57] xarker1: RETAKING GILNEAS
[1:20:00] Ionized4: i miss her
[1:20:03] sleepyboycody: i've been lost ever since
[1:20:05] Nox1o: those were good times
[1:20:12] Quiznuhtodd: The 'hardest' part for BM is to tab target Barbed Shot lmao
[1:20:15] TheTenderice: frost mage in m+, extreme button bloat, makes it hard
[1:20:16] Menethrill: STM FeelsSnowMan
[1:20:17] WARM_s6: It's the floor/ceiling argument
[1:20:17] Slensch: who cares for gilneas
[1:20:22] XadrOwO: the good times, blast the boss and then fucking die after its dead
[1:20:23] karatebaws: BM hunter? isn't that the easiest spec ever existed?
[1:20:25] feelzman: Why do all rogues have the smallest delta on logs, looking at all percentiles?
[1:20:29] freehawk1: surrender to madness was like 7 years ago
[1:20:32] OG_Kawngi: i do :)
[1:20:33] sleepyboycody: the loud mouth spriest that just compltel goes quiet in disc sub 30%...it was so fucking funny
[1:20:36] alejandro7com: Outlaw players be like: 'Is it really hard or are you just not good enough?' 😏
[1:20:40] miraagex: Clickz probably and maybe a few more
[1:20:41] miraagex: that's it
[1:20:47] flyingdruid1: Look at distribution on logs
[1:20:49] WHOisROXIS: Bond is cracked on ele too
[1:20:50] omgitsAyaliss: Any raid today?
[1:20:52] wommy: i wish big balance patch shake everything up i dont like current specs that are good
[1:20:54] nairb1: clickz/bateb prob
[1:20:57] Hred5: check driney's twitter SHEESH
[1:21:09] laetuss: too bad the legendary system messed up the spec for so long
[1:21:11] sleepyboycody: It's so fucking insane that they reworked bro. Spriest is so lackluster gameplay wise ever since
[1:21:11] Guko97: crit dmg
[1:21:23] Guko97: more void forms
[1:21:26] Sellkies: crit dmg and another void form
[1:21:28] Guko97: is the other choice
[1:21:30] Squats3: @Maximum so void form
[1:21:30] sleepyboycody: juicing ur voidforms was handsdown the best iteration of spriest.
[1:21:39] Sabteka: bring back dotless shadow
[1:21:45] Archmage_Michael: being max effective as Aug in keys is also not that easy. The dif between a great and and average Aug in higher keys is huge
[1:21:45] Gizpachi: surrender to therapy
[1:21:50] Kawatteruwow: it was only close on st, so that's actually not true

[1:22:50] OG_Kawngi: i've been chasing the high of old shadow for years
[1:22:58] laetuss: the worst is when they changed the spell sounds on so many classes for no reason at all.

[1:23:02] sleepyboycody: same bro
[1:23:08] c3rby_: explosive shot survival hunter

[1:23:58] gimmesomeganjaa: I hope they end classic after cata
[1:24:03] Byggareebob: fragnance said he would quit retail and play MoP classic if it came out
[1:24:04] Its_Big_Tone: i wish ewed stop making everything classic, ruined the term classic imo
[1:24:04] Ghendo: @c3rby_ MoP Survival hunter was GOAAATED - i was furiours when they reworked it to what it is rn

[1:24:19] ungnyaa: not true the tank role is flooded rn by danny cougars
[1:24:19] Darkshore_Capital: need that for heals
[1:24:21] FonkeeTV: Was Vengeance really a bug though?
[1:24:23] laetuss: playing wotlk shadow now. maybe nostalgia.. but it's just so nice.
[1:24:28] Cyanerd: vengeance pog
[1:24:29] Chilzi: warlocks in mop was fun
[1:24:30] leubinator: mop has the worst dungeons of all xpacs ppl going to hate it
[1:24:30] glitsmonk: they just need to make tank as a role op af
[1:24:32] AJbgodx: they should just make tanks do dmg again and I think tank population would increase alot
[1:24:34] Calynu: Haste gemmed Prot Paladins in mop was peak gameplay
[1:24:35] Avarizz: i like tnaking now
[1:24:37] timmayb166: more people going non verbal
[1:24:44] alejandro7com: Juicing your voidforms was hands down the best iteration of spriest. Surrender to therapy.

[1:24:51] Cyanerd: and challenge modes Pog
[1:24:51] Branyawn: tanking now is kind of crazy
[1:24:52] miraagex: @laetuss affli/shadow wotlk are so good. perfect amount of buttons to press. not 1-2, but not 10
[1:24:55] Nox1o: ive enjoyed SL prot pal too with insane offhealing and carrying the group
[1:24:59] RuEmileo: can we bring back that soul capacitor trinket from HFC @Maximum
[1:25:06] c3rby_: I’d tank if I didn’t need to do 2 weeks of homework routing dungeons
[1:25:13] Menethrill: Affliction MoP PepeLaugh
[1:25:18] luxumbra69: @Nox1o yeah. it was basically S1 prot paladin.
[1:25:22] wademoney3590: @Maximum tell elvui to get this patch rolled out so I can play the game
[1:25:30] Genkar85: destro mop
[1:25:30] xdanielsooon: not all tanks should be like that IMO
[1:25:33] Razdruid: its updated @wademoney3590
[1:25:36] xdanielsooon: it sure is fun to have some like that
[1:25:40] DasBull_XD: big mastery feral in mop was a VIBE in mop
[1:25:46] Nox1o: we gonna demolish those timers
[1:25:46] Mardokaj: i remember early mope we had fire arcane...fishing for arcane missiles with scorch and it got nrfed
[1:25:47] haniplace: is that 10.2.5?
[1:25:49] luxumbra69: @wademoney3590 was updated a bit ago already
[1:25:52] push_site: but the tmog
[1:25:52] XadanarGaming: Aff was the first spec in MOP to break 1million DPS on that council boss im pretty sure. Also Mop was the very last expac where snapshotting was important
[1:25:52] xBupa: its like going back and doing classic raids it just doesnt hold up to what we have now
[1:25:54] Menethrill: YEP
[1:25:55] VelouriaVR: agreed
[1:25:55] Tomoehimura: because they started m+s
[1:25:55] Razdruid: people just want challenge modes because of the tmogs
[1:25:56] Squats3: @c3rby_ you really dont. in general you can just load up the weekly route from raiderio on a 2nd monitor and follow it
[1:25:56] glitsmonk: its just bc of the transmog sets
[1:25:58] wademoney3590: oh shit
[1:26:00] MeisterChiefX: challenge modes are really easy
[1:26:03] Sermoln: how do I find a guild, anyone on illidan
[1:26:04] FonkeeTV: I feel like Gold Challenge will be like +15
[1:26:07] c3rby_: oh yea aff mop was fun. I loved the way they made dots just keep popping in drain soul rather than rapture
[1:26:08] XLchance_: dont you still have to compete times for gold?
[1:26:12] Deathlorrdd: Bro, we would pull half the dungeon at once and murder everything. How is that not fun?
[1:26:13] VelouriaVR: they also gatekep calsses so hard as well
[1:26:13] laetuss: They changed heroics in Wotlk to have more difficult settings, maybe they'll do something for challenge modes as well
[1:26:15] XLchance_: for other people on server
[1:26:22] KatoTheHealer: what is challenge mode i started in leagion
[1:26:29] bluev1king: Challenge modes were piss easy even back in mop
[1:26:40] kasper7777: They think about the shit week dynamic
[1:26:43] potatofarmer: why can't i redeem dog check channel points? :(
[1:26:43] Oldaan: 532
[1:26:44] staziko: we will appreciate no meta shitt in this game
[1:26:44] Oldaan: ++
[1:26:46] MitsuhideTenkai: agreed
[1:26:55] miraagex: Depends on what we consider casual. I raid 2 days a week + do 8 weekly m+ and consider it as casual gaming
[1:26:56] eudialit: tbh i do the same key on 20, 8x a week
[1:27:03] taanzfour: whatchu pushin bud
[1:27:09] c3rby_: they def hate certain weeks
[1:27:10] VegiXTV: it sucks when push week is like when i have to go out of time or i'm really busy with work and i end up missing the whole thing.
[1:27:10] landwardspoon: Can confirm. I'm a hardcore casual and I have never once thought about Affixes except when im watching you or dratnos
[1:27:13] bluev1king: @katothehealer its like first iteration of m+ started in mop
[1:27:16] Jimmo24: it's just gunna be dragonflight dungeons with dreadlords and we all know it
[1:27:20] adardrae: random affix for each key generated?
[1:27:26] ToxicLG: Even at lower levels people decide instead of doing a few keys each week they just do their single weekly for vault when there are bad affixes
[1:27:26] Virelo: idk i have a feeling they moved alot of ppl to war within and s4 will suffer from it
[1:27:32] c3rby_: I’m casual and I very much play less during bolstering and bursting
[1:27:33] TheCJrose1234: snooze fest
[1:27:33] taanzfour: @adardrae thats the fursthest from what ppl want
[1:27:35] kadashy1: i mean i dont mind tyran and fort
[1:27:35] alejandro7com: Haniplace asking the real questions – is that 10.2.5 or just another mystical version we've never heard of?
[1:27:42] sweetingsting: Imagine this is a costream with Tettles and hes just sleeping
[1:27:43] KatoTheHealer: @bluev1king oh okay idk thank you
[1:27:44] fleks27: gaslighting everyone into enjoying recycling old dungeons gotta be the biggest heist of modern gaming, hope that person got a fat raise
[1:28:05] nrgiee: why the fuck does everybody hate affixes, am I the only person in this game that thinks THATS what makes the dungeons fun and refreshing every week regardlless of the affix?
[1:28:09] NotsofatTheGamer: @Maximum what if for s4 we get to choose an affix out of 3 options like we did for the tier sets
[1:28:10] iiamBaro: i miss seasonal affixes, season 1 was so much fun SAJ
[1:28:13] eudialit: tbh who likes those annyoning affixes ?
[1:28:14] Keyvi_: shorter timers after 25 actually nice idea
[1:28:16] Archmage_Michael: I don't hold my breath for M+ changes. They announced nothing during Blizzcon. They just don't care about M+. They still haven't tuned the S3 dungeons
[1:28:22] ToxicLG: @nrgiee yes
[1:28:25] miraagex: @fleks27 i joined retail in DF and loved some old dungeons, like CoS and Underrot
[1:28:25] c3rby_: need affixes to all find the amount of impact as entangling
[1:28:29] xdanielsooon: i mean its the time to test stuff sure but they want it to be minimal effort @maximum
[1:28:32] dithrica: I hate tyr and fort but I really like that it switches up routing at least a bit
[1:28:34] shadwosw: Try remove aug and see how community respond
[1:28:47] freehawk1: @fleks27 I vehemently disagree, playing the same old 8 dungeons all season would get boring fast.
[1:28:48] SeanTKE: what if you chose your affixes and they gave static rating multipliers so the hardest affixes gave the most score
[1:28:55] ewevix: have less healer affixes
[1:28:56] Hydrotechnics: What about getting rid of keys? Just slam the key until you time it
[1:28:56] MrAndersen_: he agrees Pog
[1:28:57] Cyanerd: tetles said "I AGREE" too KEKW
[1:28:57] Therapy2: HE AGREES
[1:28:57] Branyawn: false, doomers will sway the public waiting for War Within
[1:29:01] magicman133: he agrees
[1:29:02] TheBroCrow: KEKW
[1:29:02] Virelo: know what would be cool? Affix's being fun instead of annoying
[1:29:05] freehawk1: @fleks27 I mean all expansion FUCK
[1:29:12] Barborsa: I want some Scarizard coooks!
[1:29:18] leubinator: @fleks27 imagine playing halls of shit and neltharus chains for a whole expac
[1:29:20] sleepyboycody: fated was last xpacs experiment, kinda makes fated for season 4 feel even more ass when you look at it that way, cause you know they wont take chances
[1:29:21] nrgiee: I swear people who complain about affixes are just social experiements ngl
[1:29:23] NotsofatTheGamer: @Maximum do you think mythic+ has been better in DF than in SL and BFA
[1:29:31] TheCJrose1234: Maybe choose your own affix so there are optimal ones per dungeon
[1:29:35] miraagex: Separate m+ and raid gear/balance Prayge
[1:29:40] SneakyWoodPecker: nothing is being cooked sadly
[1:29:42] TheCJrose1234: and then change pool once a month
[1:29:42] landwardspoon: Dude, the doomers will be out in full force for Alpha and Beta. It will be "is Wow being rushed?!!!!!! It won't be ready and Wow is failing!!!!!!!!!"
[1:29:45] laetuss: In WOTLK Classic heroics now have affixes that give you buffs.. why not have buff affixes instead of just shit that hurts you?
[1:30:09] w4cki: key specific random affixes that are bound to your key and they are random rolled every key change
[1:30:12] RigatonyTV: Why does he look like a Kmart super saiyan?
[1:30:22] boon60: M+ is just meh.....  There has to be a better option than just throwing a timer out there
[1:30:27] Gutshots: Gutshots subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[1:30:28] heisunknown: then you get bodied by something, gg
[1:30:35] itsmiraix: and then imagine not getting into groups for 35min
[1:30:45] c3rby_: yea on death affixes need to be purged. punishing people for doing what they’re supposed to do sucks
[1:30:47] Deklol: firstGarf
[1:30:49] laetuss: raid boss seagul EZ
[1:30:50] MitsuhideTenkai: Infinite duration too
[1:30:51] Hydrotechnics: it used to be permanent too right?
[1:30:53] nrgiee: But its not tho? its less fun to you, maybe? but not for everybody
[1:31:01] alejandro7com: LOL, imagine if the chat had a 'refresh' button too! We could just keep refreshing until we find the perfect comment!
[1:31:02] lolislawl5: Monk ToD week
[1:31:02] XadanarGaming: Bolstering would be sick if it was like a Damage amp both ways. Takes more dam but also does more damage. Fight to the death
[1:31:05] TirrinWoW: i am at the point where we should only have tyrannical/fort and then a solid seasonal and no other affix
[1:31:09] yifors: positive affixes is definetely the way to go
[1:31:11] reaperscarl: damn, the traumas of bolstering during shadowlands
[1:31:12] xdanielsooon: one time we bolster a maggot in UR to 89 stacks so I disagree that was fun KEKW @maximum
[1:31:13] kilkott: what is the alternative? this seems difficult to just revamp without depleting all of what M+ is @Maximum
[1:31:15] Voodoodippin: What if they added a positive affix to the pool. Like shorter CD on Lust for the week. (just and example) @Maximum
[1:31:15] rastik1347: bolstering and grevious in legion m+ monkaS
[1:31:29] aelysqt: netease ?
[1:31:29] wommy: net eas
[1:31:32] SoberCannibal: netease
[1:31:33] spicymangobaby: ncsoft
[1:31:33] honeychonker: Net ease
[1:31:33] Jjmn12: netease
[1:31:33] MeisterChiefX: netease for CN
[1:31:38] Thdlock: also its prob just chinese players on tw getting banned for being in china
[1:31:45] RumPilot: @boon60 M+ has to have the timer though.
[1:31:49] NonagonQuark: necrotic weeks were 7 day AFK weeks
[1:31:50] Lindorn_: no one survive monkaW
[1:31:52] eudialit: kinda crazy that m+ came out 7 years ago .....26th august 2016
[1:31:54] c3rby_: I don’t even like the positive affix idea because it’s gonna be impossible for all classes to benefit equally
[1:31:58] amperegames: lmfao epic
[1:32:02] Biviter: that’s kinda lit though
[1:32:07] Squats3: and they still didnt win!
[1:32:08] taanzfour: sounds good
[1:32:12] gutz101: cash cows
[1:32:23] Thadune: @Maximum You'd get banned before you even thought about it.

[1:32:45] Nox1o: everytime i hear consequences i think about the key and peele skit
[1:32:45] Lexxury: @m_g_power real money trade
[1:32:47] fleks27: if rmt was still a thing guilds would make more money from that than the race
[1:32:48] TheCJrose1234: what is rmt
[1:32:48] AngryStapler: @m_g_power real money trade

[1:33:06] Fendrixs: how would they find out your rmt m+ boost?
[1:33:10] Voodoodippin: What if they added a positive affix to the pool. Like shorter CD on Lust for the week. (just and example). @Maximum
[1:33:10] c3rby_: don’t go off pull counts, some guilds just rip pull after pull and some plan after each death
[1:33:23] shoneshaman: Hot take - more money would be better!
[1:33:26] Alarius_: that puffy p sound
[1:33:56] remli1991: i think blizzard can never do it well, if they remove affixes it is not hard/impacting enough.If blizzard adds affixes that change the dungeon gameplay players dont want to wait for a "pushweek"
[1:33:59] Nox1o: im sure there are people buying gold to buy boosts from you. its rmt, you just dont get the money KEKW
[1:34:00] Jjmn12: no one survive
[1:34:09] AngryStapler: im just waiting for blizz to let RMT happen buts sponsored by blizz itself. takes a healthy chunk of the profit
[1:34:27] sinkad: castle nathria KEKW
[1:34:29] Sutech0605: check warrior fury fyrakk logs

[1:38:46] Branyawn: the only way rmt is cool is if it goes through Blizz! Tokens baby
[1:38:46] dozure: wait*
[1:38:46] Hred5: real mony transactions
[1:38:56] Alarius_: transaction
[1:39:03] imhappyfaced: Real money transaction is the actual phrase

[1:39:31] anthrx0: stacking cheddart
[1:39:33] Jack_the_Dipper: And selling the gold they ge
[1:39:33] Nerdhino: unfortunate LuL
[1:39:40] Cntrl11120: so the only ones lasting is #1 , #2, and #14 xD
[1:39:40] Rafaelfrost_: why does Blizzard has a problem with that, I dont understand. It does not ruin the game
[1:39:40] TheBroCrow: RMT - real male tits
[1:39:41] Ravvy11: @Branyawn yes, cause they can police if you give someone gold and they don't carry you
[1:39:42] iCarDog: I need the Webster's dictionary definition of rmt please Nerdge

[1:39:52] Ethuci: @Maximum Some dude sold a night his wife to my GM for a loot funnel/mount in Seige of Orgrimar KEKW
[1:39:55] MemphisGamingTTV: Some quick googling, a 20 timed is 8 bucks
[1:39:55] sleepyboycody: @Maximum Hot take: rmt is better for game health than gold inflation
[1:40:03] swisher_szn: just do it for gold then buy wow token?
[1:40:05] weezie_61: So. Buy Tokens and then pay with gold... What is the difference?
[1:40:07] basherbash32: You can do that now. Venmo the money and have your “friend” in the group
[1:40:07] TotallyNotRaien: rmt can be some peoples livelyhood especially from poorer countries
[1:40:11] Artheeri: Aware RMT in classic WoW
[1:40:12] jberry: I used to RMT in destiny 2 my goodness we made so much money
[1:40:12] c3rby_: bad take
[1:40:17] q_u_v_p: classic rmt is rampant
[1:40:18] itsmiraix: so many ppl make cash now with selling gold
[1:40:23] dozure: im pro rmt as long as the token exists. its still rmt but only blizz gets paid which is cringe
[1:40:29] fleks27: only retail you mean?
[1:40:30] Virelo: rmt still exists but its done in a way that it looks like gold trading only harder to ban for
[1:40:33] SeraphimSentinel: @weezie_61 Its cheaper to buy gold from some thats not blizzard. Its dumb, but its cheaper
[1:40:34] fleks27: there is LOTS of rmt on classic
[1:40:34] savarunl: @weezie_61 i'm guessing the direct rmt is much cheaper than tokens to gold
[1:40:36] UnfinishedBiz: we've been RMTing since everquest
[1:40:37] sleepyboycody: Hot take: rmt is better for game health than gold inflation
[1:40:44] fdb33: wotlk has a butt ton of RMT, u just buy gold to then gdkp so there’s 1 more step. it’s ridiculously rampant
[1:40:45] Jack_the_Dipper: Even the advertisers in the service channel make some nice cash
[1:40:48] MemphisGamingTTV: 20 timed is 8 bucks, 7/8 mythic is 120 to give you some recent pricing for context
[1:40:57] xhriiis: challenge modes were massive rmt it was crazy
[1:41:00] feelzman: Used to sell challenge mode runs, paypal only, was good beer money
[1:41:08] nightst314: classic is RMT heaven given the bots
[1:41:14] rbgdev: i highly suggest all of you invest your money in savings and mutual funds, not video games
[1:41:19] Billient: Billient subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[1:41:21] Ruinx81: Classic era is a cesspool of gold buying
[1:41:23] sleepyboycody: I'd rather paypal some dude than buy gold. way better for the game economy if you ask me..
[1:41:29] XadanarGaming: people still do a ton of RMT on Retail
[1:41:30] kadashy1: KEKW
[1:41:33] Buboniks: i just typed fyrak mythic boost in google, it costs 800 fricking dollars, i can't imagine people pay that !!!!!

[1:41:51] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat's cheesin' it up with cheddar stacking! 😄🧀
[1:41:53] astreinoid: well having classic reset so often with new seasons and servers means less fear of ban. easier to have throwaway accounts unfort.
[1:41:53] Nerdhino: why does he keep saying it's unfortunate
[1:41:55] Benjg7: what money?
[1:41:58] Maldre: when did the ban happen?
[1:42:00] savarunl: what is the big issue for blizzard with people buying boosts for real money though? is it purely that they lose out on the token money?
[1:42:02] shadwosw: you think we losers have money to invest?
[1:42:04] rbgdev: @goombacci ive been here all day
[1:42:04] miraagex: @mmrtbang probably meant 7-8, but seems way too low for tindral kill
[1:42:08] M1stakilla: I got blessed with the Heroic Fyrakk trinket in my vault
[1:42:09] PrinceLuTen: One of my raiders changed his DF name to Apexsexhaver and its living in my head rent free
[1:42:11] PrinceLuTen: send help
[1:42:19] 0kfatty: if your a top lvl m+ player, you should be able to mythic raid so easy:P am i wrong??!
[1:42:21] SeraphimSentinel: @Buboniks If they sell 800$ in mythic + carries then they are just trading labor, and the are better at m+ than they are at raiding

[1:43:25] Mattefofan: YES
[1:43:25] MagicMonte: @savarunl Tokens are exactly the issue. Blizzard doesn't care about boosting, they care when you cut into their profits.
[1:43:28] jonpelf: don't need the whole group to drag either

[1:43:42] lol_iris: yes
[1:43:46] marchippp: MDI incoming PepeLaugh
[1:43:46] luxumbra69: that's why the want to take witherbark to the council boss.

[1:44:25] jentboom: Not dark mode gross
[1:44:27] big_butts420: OMEGALUL
[1:44:27] OnlyaOnly: there are two ways to bug it out, one way to let it sit in dmg forever, the other way is to drag it along but the orbs will follow him to wherever he is and eventually get to him, ending dmg phase

[1:46:02] savarunl: they can't even balance hc properly for small groups, why would you want mythic flex
[1:46:03] fbgchris: what’s flex mythic?
[1:46:05] Tankersss: I would love flex mythic raid, my guild gets 16-18 people and GM does not want to pug rest sadly

[1:46:18] Lothland: Open flex after hall of fame
[1:46:20] goombacci: best raider mdt
[1:46:26] Buboniks: @SeraphimSentinel They also are not garanteed loot right ? so it's possible they pay for it multiple times or am i just thinking about it too much ?
[1:46:48] Tikilu: theres 2 mobs at the end worth 1% each you missed

[1:47:22] Ancine: is this mdi tech?
[1:47:22] tigglers: @feelzman u can
[1:47:23] ubba90: so damage done to the boss is like giga amplified. so if you attack the boss and cleave off of him does that damage get amped into secondary targets? or does it go back to normal?
[1:47:26] feelzman: the vines are there
[1:47:28] lirly__: the adds snap up to that ledge

[1:47:56] eudialit: just be a monk
[1:47:59] Nickystr1x: @ubba90 usually damage amps like that don't translate to cleave effects to prevent degen double dipping
[1:48:04] ChopperYami: Also Gnarlroot will despawn if running through the door
[1:48:04] orkarnage: You cant drag the boss this way, you need to get him around the other entrance
[1:48:20] Nox1o: about to sell me insurance
[1:48:27] fleks27: looks like hes about to sell me Pi for 220 dollars

[1:49:05] nopally: @loinex just no
[1:49:08] Najb0lji: how is tindral after the nerfs @Maximum

[1:49:20] Clarius: @feelzman and who is asking? are u relevant
[1:49:23] nemziac: on your vuhdu or elvui
[1:49:30] moash_: Laro was fun af to heal. We had the adds still up in p2 so I padded on them
[1:49:31] Elindalyne: literally 0 public logs of anyone pulling tindral yet
[1:49:34] Akruziel1337: ApuApustaja
[1:49:38] lvdw1g: why was his eye tweaking
[1:49:40] Vones: when I'm trying to ramp and my atonement goes on a stupid ass npc
[1:49:50] MitsuhideTenkai: That popoff!
[1:49:52] Menethrill: EZ
[1:49:53] SirPikajew: We'll find out about Tindral nerfs from JB's twitter tomorrow after his guild sees it
[1:49:54] savarunl: think fyrakk is fine to heal (heroic only, i dont raid mythic), just  NOT on evoker, the limited range really kills it on that boss
[1:50:01] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[1:50:03] iiamBaro: the overwatch shirt, i love that

[1:50:53] fleks27: good hack
[1:50:54] Therealbrokensword: like it or not the damage/healing meter is a core part of the gameplay
[1:50:56] TCGJordan: serenity was never as low as world 13
[1:50:57] friday_exe: I only play cus dps meters exist
[1:50:59] Sinergy_57: Mind upping volume a bit?
[1:51:00] Perry_TP: heal me 😠
[1:51:21] sckeperz: as a former disc healer i hate atonement and wish it would disappear forever
[1:51:26] Faraday5001: yes
[1:51:27] Derilz: yes
[1:51:29] Thadune: Because Future came after Serenity iirc.. and I think Serenity disbanded after Guldan
[1:51:31] sleepyboycody: yeah its less locked
[1:51:32] cotillion215: it definitely flows better than last season
[1:51:32] Zharvan: ye

[1:51:34] tanikins: Disc is easier
[1:51:34] ChopperYami: Yea its easier now
[1:51:35] andenot: @Clarius hallo
[1:51:35] SirPikajew: It is
[1:51:37] Varae__: its more forgiving
[1:51:38] moash_: Timing it is still hard but easier to play
[1:51:39] wazon_7: its easier but you still need to know the fight well to play well
[1:51:39] loinex: damage rotation is easier, but renew needs to go.
[1:51:39] Nox1o: the comment that it feels good when your spec is good in raid coming from a disc priest is just weird
[1:51:44] MagicMonte: Disc is still the hardest healer in raid.
[1:51:46] Faraday5001: as long as you hit smite enough to get enough squid CDR its ez
[1:51:47] Auphius: Ramping is just as hard, but the damage rotation afterwards is much easier
[1:51:47] fleks27: easier to do stuff, can still fuck yourself hard with it - nice mix
[1:51:48] Biviter: Biviter subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! mmmmm
[1:51:49] Vones: I like disc when it was harder
[1:51:50] anthrx0: solo heal 25 man HC garrosh
[1:51:50] andenot: @Clarius jak ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:51:51] yifors: its core its the same, its dmg rotation got easier
[1:51:55] savarunl: the real fun is in m+ play a spec everyone says is trash (like ww right now) and still top overall with it in 90% of keys cause all the fotm players do shit KEKW
[1:52:02] Beanxtown: spirit shell Madge
[1:52:05] ChopperYami: But still huge rewards if timing is perfect
[1:52:07] eudialit: mop spiritshell was op
[1:52:15] tanikins: you still need to know timers to ramp properly, but it's easier to execute since rotation is easier for damage
[1:52:18] Menethrill: Mop Disc was really fun YEP
[1:52:24] Vones: bring back boon
[1:52:25] ryanchungo: @maximum your mic is super good at picking up your mouth noises when you eat
[1:52:28] mas0ndota2: Why did they remove spirit shell actually?
[1:52:31] Nox1o: @savarunl people that say ww is trash are trash by defintion, ww does really good dmg
[1:52:37] eudialit: @Menethrill kill it
[1:52:53] WARM_s6: ww feels like the best kept secret, it cranks
[1:52:54] alejandro7com: Mind upping volume a bit?
[1:52:57] savarunl: @savarunl yeah that's kinda what i mean, it's super low rated on every meta site though, subcreation etc

[1:53:43] Lexxury: OMEGALUL
[1:53:48] lukinss: did you see the preach vid on the og race for wf?
[1:53:49] Nox1o: @savarunl thats because those sites are not a good reference and mostly based on popularity
[1:53:50] misran: @savarunl the buff came too late in the patch.  every good player was already playing something else, and catching up alts with current aspect caps is awful
[1:53:54] Slayen84: lmao'
[1:54:01] dozure: hey max i feel like ur seein things other people arent

[1:54:47] malnourish_: @bebincalicious I mean he is a twitch streamer hehe
[1:54:51] alejandro7com: @Nox1o maybe he's trying to wink at you ;)
[1:54:56] Menethrill: PepeLaugh
[1:55:07] savarunl: @savarunl agreed yeah, sad thing is when you go above 20 all the pugs read those sites like a bible, b-tier class = no invite

[1:56:46] JohnAllenCasts: Do we know which beams got removed from the fight on the nerf?
[1:56:58] JohnAllenCasts: they didn't specify before right
[1:57:00] jolsh_dtd: whats going on with voting on tier for S4?
[1:57:14] RoVcoVeR: 4 seeds less and no double soak sounds line breaking Tswifts' knees
[1:57:19] PapaNeeks: @jolsh_dtd it’s finished
[1:57:43] jolsh_dtd: so in S4 well get teir based on the votes?
[1:57:58] Chappypappy1: I have a coworker at Dominos who is 35 yr old acoustic FF14 enthusiast and he is insufferable
[1:57:59] Warm___Blanket: Warm___Blanket subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months!

[1:58:15] maplelost: did he just say sale runs
[1:58:23] HarmlessCurse: didn't even know there was a vote until it was over pog
[1:58:24] alejandro7com: Looks like there's some confusion about the beams that got removed from the fight on the nerf. Maybe they were just trying to lighten the load and make it more 'beam'-able!
[1:59:16] LemmingsOCE: Jak is such posi vibes i love this guy
[1:59:17] BadManners_: you do it at every rank

[2:00:01] Clarius: KEKW
[2:00:04] valdekius: absolutely true, even for guilds who are just trying to achieve above the curve (or w/e the heroic achievement is)
[2:00:05] Rogastik: Woah I feel called out
[2:00:05] PapaNeeks: @maximum have you seen Preach’s vid about the first ever race to world first back in Naxx?
[2:00:07] yayyfst: hello what time is the raid ?
[2:00:08] Crippa: overtime police
[2:00:09] savarunl: it's like any sports right. if your footbal lclub doesnt win the champions league it doesn't mean they are irrelevant either
[2:00:30] Bablodin85: trues about semi-hardcor guilds LUL
[2:00:38] CPT_Lemons: No way, AOTC guilds I have been in care less about other guilds raiding around the same time
[2:00:39] ubba90: on small realms it happens
[2:00:42] Xaide_1: the BEST 3 night guild (never more than 3) oh i remember those days lmfao

[2:00:52] xxpurplehazen: lothar FeelsStrongMan
[2:00:53] barkbitten: Do we get one Catacharge every week from this reset? Wowheads guide still says every 2 week? Eu players asking
[2:00:55] xCyborgSheepx: @Maximum gotta get a raid together with the Late night sorcery guys again XD
[2:00:57] Nagollith: We do because its fun. It means nothing
[2:01:09] ashla11: im in a heroic guild that does whatever mythic we can get and I have no idea what other guilds do lol
[2:01:29] PapaNeeks: anyone remember Death and Taxes?
[2:01:30] JohnAllenCasts: Do you remember bofa?
[2:01:44] valdekius: also what I'm talking about heroic guilds caring about is comparing themselves with other guilds similar to them and how fast they kill certain bosses
[2:01:52] lol_iris: @Maximum any tips on pushing for title first m+ season (just hit 3k)? pugging only so far
[2:01:52] sebastian___96: @JohnAllenCasts PepeLaugh
[2:02:00] mystralwastaken: @Maximum RLE was looking for you for the Tindy guide Liquid released btw ConcernDoge
[2:02:02] iMeista: @Maximum hows the feeling of the high end players about this season? my guild just died bc 10 people stopped enjoying this tier
[2:02:05] alejandro7com: Looks like we're all in this together, watching the raid drama unfold! 🍿
[2:02:32] Nickystr1x: on my first server there was only a handful of guilds that did heroic, was cool to see your guilds name on the server first list
[2:02:38] RoVcoVeR: you raid the last month of a tier with all the nerfs
[2:02:49] jfriendly: LMAO
[2:02:53] mr_jimbone: drama?
[2:02:53] t_r_a_i_t: Why are NA so dumb
[2:02:55] Riot_Blacktimus: does anyone know if there was balance tuning for the patch? Can't find anything mentioning it
[2:02:58] Darklott: pull count gotta be the dumbest of any comparison between guilds
[2:03:00] Menethrill: PepeLaugh
[2:03:02] malnourish_: lmfaoooooo
[2:03:03] muonz: @mystralwastaken good taunt

[2:03:57] shoneshaman: what is raid leader exchange
[2:03:58] PrinceLuTen: @Maximum You should watch the Fyrakk one. They clearly sped Kalamazi up to 1.25 speed
[2:04:00] mystralwastaken: I mean, aren't you supposed to be responsible for those? KEKW
[2:04:03] FURL_: wow shitting on your own company, thats a bold move cotton. Lets see how this playes out

[2:04:14] miraagex: @itsCelivan its like 95%+ reason of most youtube videos probably
[2:04:20] shadwosw: Do not use the Liquid guide that was recently posted to their youtube. It contains several errors/confusing information as of making this post.     lmao
[2:04:22] mystralwastaken: Considering they're under the Liquid brand
[2:04:23] orkarnage: Fyrakk one

[2:04:50] fluupie: telagon?
[2:04:52] JohnAllenCasts: listen to it on .75x speed see if it sounds normal?
[2:04:55] Psyquest: Why are they using the Liquid name?
[2:04:56] miraagex: 100% sped up
[2:04:57] Jabronie_808: @t_r_a_i_t now?
[2:04:57] c3rby_: I hate the meta of speed talking on all content
[2:05:03] cakiftw: i cant understand a word he says in these guides
[2:05:07] OG_Kawngi: they said bro is yappin
[2:05:08] PrinceLuTen: You can tell because some words are so short you can't even tell what he said. It sounds normal on .75
[2:05:14] KaisenSiru: YEP
[2:05:21] Nox1o: even audiobooks? some readers are so slow i lose interest
[2:05:22] rtee1__: 1.2 is fine
[2:05:22] miraagex: YEP
[2:05:23] arcthe0ry: listening to anything sped up is so cringe I hate when people do that

[2:05:35] rtee1__: try tho put to less speed
[2:05:38] Riot_Blacktimus: can be quite relaxing tho
[2:05:38] TheCJrose1234: its good for audio books. Cause a lot of the time the readers are really doing the most with their voices
[2:05:38] litixio: go 0.75 speed @Maximum
[2:05:39] Yoitsnova: god thats awful
[2:05:41] PrinceLuTen: Play it on .75 and it sounds reasonable
[2:05:42] swagggle: also Kalamazi naturally talks pretty fast anyway
[2:05:43] tiptoptrafik: any class changes?
[2:05:47] Squats3: @Maximum scotts expression is perfect for the start of this video

[2:05:58] Ionized4: itll be close though
[2:06:00] Brohdin: I went to 1.5-2x because youtubers milk 5 mins of content to 10 mins by talking giga slow
[2:06:00] JohnAllenCasts: not quite, but close enough
[2:06:00] Nox1o: nah, you would need 0.8
[2:06:01] lol_iris: not same
[2:06:02] miraagex: @tiptoptrafik evoker got roar as true dragonflighting. iirc that's all
[2:06:03] Nox1o: but its fine

[2:06:07] Sover31gn: 0.94
[2:06:11] alejandro7com: Full kidney? Is that the new in-game currency or just a creative way to describe someone's dedication to farming content?
[2:06:14] rtee1__: KEKW
[2:06:14] ShadesOBlue: Nah some YouTubers just talk too slow
[2:06:20] amperegames: leaned up
[2:06:21] GM_Sabbat: max all they said in the rle discord is that the liquid guide is incorrect, i think its a meme ping
[2:06:21] swisher_szn: sounds like hes drunk
[2:06:24] PrinceLuTen: its .625 short or something
[2:06:25] Biviter: hit custom speed
[2:06:25] AJbgodx: 0.8 would be needed ye
[2:06:30] Hamzah39: what if hes just talking fast
[2:06:35] c3rby_: depends on how fast they sped him up in production
[2:06:36] enigmasvea: says 2 words in one
[2:06:40] Fonjask: Custom top right in playback speed window
[2:06:57] Gortad: it seems they speed up some parts, but not everything
[2:07:03] PrinceLuTen: There are some words that get cut off with how short they are
[2:07:03] JdTre: he's just reading
[2:07:06] Hamzah39: sounds like a script yea
[2:07:08] TheBroCrow: He's just a rap god
[2:07:09] itsCelivan: It might be both?
[2:07:13] t_r_a_i_t: Lmao

[2:07:18] Hamzah39: he also practiced it 6x
[2:07:19] JohnAllenCasts: wait there's custom speedup multipliers  on YT? that's cracked
[2:07:21] VRVento: @Maximum Eiya did one of these on stream and she was 100% reading a script she was sent

[2:08:07] rtee1__: aahahaahahaa
[2:08:10] PrinceLuTen: Words get cut off with how fast they are. He is annunciating clearly on other words so there is no reason his words get cut off with how short they are.
[2:08:10] codethename: we'll do it live
[2:08:12] Nickystr1x: that goes insanely hard though
[2:08:17] JohnAllenCasts: that's impressive to be able to do it first run though. Script reads aren't easy

[2:10:40] gammerinno: new 10.2.5 feature: catch these hands I. a game of ping pong
[2:10:42] Lexxury: it's very uncomfortable if someone is looking directly at the camera often
[2:10:42] JohnAllenCasts: people get weirded out by full screen cam streamers using it for chat
[2:10:42] Riot_Blacktimus: teleprompter for streamers is the new meta im afraid
[2:10:42] savarunl: this is how they used to do it for tv recording in the 70s KEKW

[2:29:28] Zzekar: so how do u fix that? “kee buff warr 10% buffed first 2 months” and then nerf it by what? 10% 5%.. this also seems weird and bad .. just give druid leggendary already… @maximum
[2:29:31] vepsee: I mean it talks about vanilla and shit
[2:29:32] l3aml3oo: @skitz888 gillneas thingy
[2:29:33] smolderdaddyuwu: worth a shot buddy, free content
[2:29:33] vepsee: it wont interest u
[2:29:33] Lothland: gotta love this twitter integration level patch :p
[2:29:35] jdtopgun93: its history of the first race to world first
[2:29:37] alejandro7com: Nice try, Alejandro, but your roasts are more like gentle toasts. Maybe upgrade your roasting gear! 😄
[2:29:37] theDirtyon3: doesnt trust us Sadge
[2:29:37] suclarberg: can we watch asmongold please.
[2:29:39] Pyrrha_GG: @kazuya_1580 all of them, you need to be able to do all of them
[2:29:41] Virelo: @JohnAllenCasts but is there anyone satisfied with the current legendary
[2:29:42] ToxicLG: Eh it was a good watch but idk if you would find it interesting
[2:29:44] xrandomdoodx: ele has very mediocre mass AOE, just good <6 target pulls and bosses. Ele needs defensive help more than anything lol
[2:29:44] Zzekar: **keep warr buffed hahaha
[2:29:46] Teddyhowdy: how is ww monk now?
[2:29:48] Nox1o: not sure if good stream content, but for sure easy react content
[2:30:01] suclarberg: can we watch asmongold rat compilation
[2:30:05] vepsee: react harder
[2:30:06] Nativo1: @Zzekar druid legendary?
[2:30:07] vepsee: Madge
[2:30:15] ToxicLG: YEP
[2:30:17] Teddyhowdy: how is ww monk now max
[2:30:18] Troniin: the leaves on the trees in the old world are all just clip art lol
[2:30:23] spivet: non verbal chair stream
[2:30:24] Nerdhino: that's called DMCA breach Kappa
[2:30:27] theDirtyon3: my juicer
[2:30:28] Karkesis: you can't lol
[2:30:29] XLchance_: the meta is fuckin depressing tbh
[2:30:29] Squats3: yoyu cant lol
[2:30:31] lazymike208: lazymike208 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:30:35] BurtikShaun: pretty sure thats bordering some dmca
[2:30:36] Therealbrokensword: I havent seen it but I imagine it will be similar to when we've tried to watch things with you featuring heavily in it in the past haha
[2:30:36] itsCelivan: hasn't stopped him so
[2:30:36] Ristvakbaen1911: I realize 20s probably aren't the greatest indicator but I've yet to see a good mage or boomkin in my keys
[2:30:38] Daesaster: xQc soudns like he's sped up when he talks irl.
[2:30:41] ToxicLG: "fair use" OMEGALUL
[2:30:45] Jjmn12: does he get in trouble for anything
[2:30:52] misfitstv1: max how come you don’t make a team of streamers for the MDI and just see if you can get invited to finals for the fun of it for content?
[2:31:00] LemmingsOCE: Max what ever happened to that warrior in your guild who was like a michelin star chef? I forgot his name @Maximum  󠀀
[2:31:02] smolderdaddyuwu: they are degens regardless
[2:31:05] Sover31gn: Those are the same people that write in your chat to play the video
[2:31:06] rtee1__: excited for new expansion?
[2:31:07] Nox1o: @Daesaster he put all his skill points into speech
[2:31:08] vepsee: hes too big of a streamer to genuinely get in trouble unless he did some illegal shit
[2:31:12] Donjuan_: xqc is rich enough and big enough that he will face no consequences anyway
[2:31:14] Karkesis: if you do that with a video made by somebody who actually has the money to pursue legal action they can absolutely sue you
[2:31:15] Donjuan_: dude can do whatever he wants
[2:31:22] LemmingsOCE: YEAH soy
[2:31:24] Aadraa: !ui
[2:31:25] TalanyaTV: hey max hope you're having a good day!
[2:31:29] Daesaster: @Nox1o Lol. Facts brother.
[2:31:30] Therealbrokensword: Gordon Slamsey?
[2:31:39] Teepone: @Maximum Do we know which beam is gone in P1 yet? Tindral.
[2:31:41] MemphisGamingTTV: Man of many talents
[2:31:41] gerhardtx: Let him cook
[2:31:49] misfitstv1: Johnny sins of gaming
[2:31:49] Nox1o: i doubt a michelin chef has time for your raid schedule
[2:31:51] Clutchy2G: thats a switch up
[2:31:55] miraagex: @Teepone it's 99% the beam after first root and before THE RUN
[2:31:56] rtee1__: @thdlock is it you? the chef?🧑‍🍳
[2:32:08] Faraday5001: aparantly is the 3rd
[2:32:09] Trodenskjold: @Nox1o Just cook in between pulls
[2:32:14] Lyonidus: probably the one at 50 seconds so there's no big double beam overlap
[2:32:16] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:32:16] Squats3: only thing thd is cookin is chicken tindies
[2:32:24] Headroom87: EU players play with high ping?
[2:32:39] SniggleJake572: @Squats3 thinking he even cooks KEKW
[2:32:41] rtee1__: @squats3 KEKW
[2:32:41] Nativo1: @Headroom87 of course
[2:32:44] xoxotobie: do you like where the game is headin not story wise but gameplay wise?
[2:32:45] Troniin: you guys technically always raid on patch days
[2:32:49] Trodenskjold: So you gonna retake Gilneas today @Maximum
[2:32:50] sukoWoW: Max Aug arc?
[2:32:51] shadwosw: wait Liquid has EU player doing RWF?
[2:32:52] jesuslouise: @Squats3 cause that's all you need WideTHD
[2:32:55] Doenos: @Squats3 and takes, but he tends to overcook them....
[2:32:56] Teepone: @miraagex *** This clip it looks like that Beam is still there. Idk if I'm seeing it wrong
[2:32:56] smolderdaddyuwu: @Headroom87 NA accounts
[2:33:11] ZeroEightG: any class tuning inc?
[2:33:27] vepsee: @smolderdaddyuwu that wouldnt change ping lol
[2:33:35] Teepone: @Maximum Pulled from Raid Leader Exchange, 2 hours ago
[2:33:48] just_ie: How is Tindral nerfs the only real tuning happening in 10.2.5? Did they give up on season 3 already xdd
[2:34:02] miraagex: @just_ie what would you tune?
[2:34:06] tempehst11: why isnt he soaring natty?
[2:34:27] Arcinatos: max if you dont get off of your mount and soar with your green boi i will go non verbal
[2:34:33] Teepone: @Maximum Idk how to DM, added you in Tindral Discussion on Raid Leader Exchange
[2:34:33] dragonprayer789: tuning is great this tier, tswift is just very hard
[2:34:41] alejandro7com: @just_ie They must be saving all the good tuning for a surprise season finale! 🎉
[2:34:45] Kynaz01: dming u now
[2:34:45] miraagex: @dragonprayer789 nerf is overkil ltho, especially the seeds
[2:34:46] dorns1988: Is the tagline for the video Im assuming, is a joke?
[2:34:54] yungdoccy: sang just got legendary on his ret
[2:35:05] dantucker: lmao that's my raid leader
[2:35:05] orkarnage: GIGACHAD
[2:35:06] sukoWoW: gamer
[2:35:09] xxpurplehazen: baseg
[2:35:22] Menethrill: GIGACHAD
[2:35:22] potatofarmer: that potato is doing the farm proud.
[2:35:25] Tanonn: Prayge
[2:35:53] Auphius: He's casting a firebeam just as you paused the video
[2:36:13] miraagex: we use it YEP
[2:36:25] Jjmn12: yes
[2:36:26] furtif_69: yep
[2:36:26] Petarglio: @Auphius He normally casts it twice there so it looks like they removed one of the two casts
[2:36:26] Faraday5001: yee
[2:36:26] tofuboy87: ye
[2:36:27] Keppie__: YEP
[2:36:27] sukoWoW: yes
[2:36:27] puneet911: YEP
[2:36:28] Clarius: yeah think so
[2:36:29] RngrTV: yes
[2:36:30] Draynor_: ye pretty much
[2:36:34] Teepone: Ye
[2:36:34] alejandro7com: Looks like the streamer is on fire with that firebeam! 🔥🔥 But hey, did they forget to cast it twice? 😄
[2:36:43] Draynor_: there are also only three orbs
[2:36:49] TimmayHS: I would not trust this vod
[2:36:56] miraagex: sus vod
[2:36:59] Lyonidus: my guess is the 2nd cast, where you do the big move, is the one that is taken out
[2:37:00] JayAreGG: it used to cast 2 back to back
[2:37:03] Jjmn12: this is the fire beam to move no?
[2:37:05] JayAreGG: it might still idk
[2:37:09] sukoWoW: combat text over action bars is driving me insane
[2:37:12] TimmayHS: idk, it's just some rando vod
[2:37:20] JayAreGG: where are the logs to this 2 man pull lol
[2:37:23] furtif_69: @sukoWoW why did you point this out this is awful
[2:37:25] muonz: @TimmayHS think its a deep fake or?
[2:37:28] Draynor_: its only three orbs for feather peeps also
[2:37:35] PrinceLuTen: Isnt he not casting roots?
[2:37:36] NotDage: wait what did they change
[2:37:39] JonBarackSnow: even changed time in windows to deceive you
[2:37:44] PrinceLuTen: But he isnt casting roots, that could fuck with the spell queue, no?
[2:37:45] TimmayHS: @muonz no clue
[2:37:49] Nolan_iii: Nolan_iii subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:37:54] DoYouEvenFlex: thats my tank right there bby
[2:37:59] Keppie__: he does two in a row
[2:37:59] muonz: they just removed the first of 2 firebeams at that time no?
[2:38:00] loxidous: thats probably the last one of the phase
[2:38:00] JayAreGG: look at cast logs
[2:38:02] prupple: so it skips the first of the back to back pair
[2:38:03] DoYouEvenFlex: love u dang <3
[2:38:04] PrinceLuTen: Boss isnt casting roots @Maximum
[2:38:05] lessahj: he casts twice.
[2:38:07] KaisenSiru: HUH
[2:38:07] Keppie__: or he used to
[2:38:09] Yungpupperz: Theres 2 firebeam casts after those roots
[2:38:10] lessahj: Now its only once.
[2:38:10] alvein88: a single dude it seems he is not doing roots
[2:38:13] Mr_Erwt: Skips the first one then does the one where you would have the small move before
[2:38:14] MeisterChiefX: they moved the timing to in between the two beam casts
[2:38:17] Lyonidus: he does 2 really fast
[2:38:18] kramniksdeletedcomments: can you link the vod @Maximum
[2:38:18] Addonexuswow: they removed the first of the two beams
[2:38:21] Addonexuswow: not the 2nd
[2:38:21] Lyonidus: prolly only does 1 now
[2:38:23] Keppie__: He used to do two in a row
[2:38:24] JayAreGG: there used to be 2 casts with like 4 seconds in between
[2:38:25] RngrTV: it used to do in a row there
[2:38:26] loxidous: mabye they put it in betrween where the other 2 were
[2:38:26] lolaustin: @PrinceLuTen Boss doesnt root on tanks
[2:38:27] PrinceLuTen: Could his spell queue be fucked up because he isnt casting roots at all?
[2:38:27] miraagex: 1 fire beam at roots and 1 before run. roots beam removed?
[2:38:30] kadashy1: wouldnt his timers be fucked right now
[2:38:41] alejandro7com: Nice try, but I think the steamer is just trying to keep us on our toes with those spell queues! 😄
[2:38:41] RngrTV: you would be in roots then fire beam spawn then take a few steps adn spawn another then big move for the 2nd root
[2:38:42] Thdlock: thats the wrong one to remove KEKW
[2:38:42] Jjmn12: so you just dont have to do a baby move before big move
[2:38:44] MeisterChiefX: they shifted the timing to be in between the two casts
[2:38:54] RngrTV: now only 1 fire beam spawns in between so 2nd roots should be easier after the big move
[2:39:03] muonz: before he did a fire beam at 35s and another at 40, they removed the 35s one
[2:39:10] Keppie__: well that is a set
[2:39:16] prupple: @muonz this right here
[2:39:19] Auphius: can you get a side by side of boss timers from last week?
[2:39:20] m1lkman10: Hey Max I gotta jump my car. Can you pull up a quick guide onhow to jump your car on stream so I can stay tuned in?
[2:39:21] Sponsorn: NOTED
[2:39:23] Cycore: that's super irrelevant lmao
[2:39:24] PrinceLuTen: Would the boss be irregular because he didnt even try to cast roots 1?
[2:39:36] Keppie__: ye but you have longer to clear the root
[2:39:55] DreadfuryDK: What beam did they remove?
[2:40:04] Petarglio: They removed the fire beam cast at 35 seconds
[2:40:08] Keppie__: @DreadfuryDK 2nd beam p1
[2:40:18] Artenuous: you used to have to run all over the platform, now you only have to do like half of the platform
[2:40:18] DreadfuryDK: So they deleted the turbo ass overlap?
[2:40:24] Zucchini3: Zucchini3 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 69 months! 
[2:40:29] miraagex: @Zucchini3 69 nice
[2:40:42] prupple: would you have time to slip in behind the first wave of beams before the roots come out?
[2:40:46] xxpurplehazen: nice
[2:40:46] miraagex: YEP
[2:41:07] puneet911: monkaW 2 tindrals
[2:41:19] alejandro7com: @Artenuous I remember the good old days when we had to dodge all the beams and pray for RNGesus. Now it's too easy. #MakeBeamsGreatAgain
[2:41:25] JohnAllenCasts: The increased distance gives more time before the beams reach the seeds though right? so the further you move the more clean time you have to slam roots
[2:41:28] Treebuckett: @Maximum apparently its the 1st of the double beam set thats missing. so people think you still need to immune the 50s roots
[2:41:36] DreadfuryDK: As long as this isn't gonna be a 500 pull boss anymore I'm reasonably happy.
[2:41:53] LazerBeemz: where can we find this clip?
[2:41:59] miraagex: play like p2
[2:42:13] Keppie__: still think you want to move somewhat far for the root breaks
[2:42:18] prupple: theres like 2 seconds between first wave of beams and roots going out
[2:42:20] Artenuous: @alejandro7com my guild got the boss to 60% prenerfs, we were lowkey bummed it got nerfed Smoge
[2:42:23] prupple: idk if thats enough time
[2:42:39] DreadfuryDK: @Artenuous Don't be bummed. You weren't gonna kill that within the next several weeks anyway.
[2:42:45] Alarius_: olddip what that skip do
[2:43:10] MelipnosTV: just got here, 4 dispells still?
[2:43:25] Hurbob14: @MelipnosTV yep
[2:43:29] Nuublet: Adge
[2:43:31] gonzobone: y'all got any of them lua errors
[2:43:40] miraagex: I hate seeds change
[2:43:48] miraagex: p1 is learnable in 50-100 pulls, but seeds is what makes it spicy
[2:43:51] JohnAllenCasts: where did you find the stream for the new tindral @Maximum ?
[2:43:56] miraagex: Yes
[2:43:56] Lara_TV_: Me too, and yes
[2:44:06] fleks27: need og state mode, talk to npc to pull prenerf
[2:44:09] Sheepywow: i hate beams, seeds were ok imo
[2:44:32] menzlo: JB crushed
[2:44:33] Voodoodippin: If you are over 200 pulls give it up pal lol
[2:44:33] DreadfuryDK: We were on the boss for 3 weeks and I'm nothing but hyped for these nerfs. I greatly dislike bosses like Tindral.
[2:44:34] Tones___: sounds like a them problem
[2:44:41] shadwosw: i felt only the guild almost killed it will be unhappy
[2:44:46] kadashy1: im willing to bet even the people who were on the boss are fine with it being nerfed
[2:44:47] miraagex: That would be Pog
[2:44:50] shadwosw: our guild is at P2 and rarely P3. Happy with the nerf
[2:44:52] brosciencegym: @Maximum  blizzard is spoon feeind these guilds
[2:44:56] rsheridan89: Destiny has that, contest mode
[2:44:57] Onyo1337: we killed zskarn before the week before traps could be baited, felt so good
[2:45:01] jschultz214: ggs max going to watch hockey
[2:45:11] Biviter: That would be gas
[2:45:12] owlietm: either of changes to seeds was fine by itself, two simultaneously is overkill imo
[2:45:13] DreadfuryDK: Yeah no, nobody would kill Tindral and Fyrakk LMAO
[2:45:15] Lyonidus: then they'd need to tune the game way fucking better
[2:45:15] fleks27: cool thing to do post finishing a tier
[2:45:20] CHR0NiC11: nymu is a cuck
[2:45:24] zarrok7: better than fated
[2:45:30] tofuboy87: You weren't WF for Gnarlroot bud
[2:45:30] Jjmn12: they prob dont want people having access to content that is practically impossible
[2:45:33] MeisterChiefX: very very few
[2:45:40] prupple: would incentivise farming m+ for leech/avodiance gear quite heavily since your ilevel is scaled
[2:45:43] Wheva: I think trying to get your entire guild to agree to that will be very hard
[2:45:44] JohnAllenCasts: Think there's like 900 guilds on tindral prog atm. Maybe 200 of those were close to a kill. My guild just had our first raid on tindral this reset just gone
[2:45:50] Zzekar: @maximum what was theavg ilvl of ur kill
[2:45:50] gonzobone: not sure if anyone has said anything but details is the addon culpable for all the lua errors
[2:45:52] YoungPingu: halondrus pre nerf Aware
[2:45:57] Wheva: I bet less then 1% of CE guilds would even engage with it
[2:45:59] tisiwonz: its fun
[2:45:59] Jramm187: no one
[2:46:12] MeisterChiefX: absolutely nobody would subject themselves to that
[2:46:18] Erry_tv: i m unhappy, 250 pulls, with progression, but now it feels like they give us the kill for free.  Boss was too hard (even with post rwf nerf), but now it feels just too easy.
[2:46:19] smolderdaddyuwu: the same reason you keep doing private servers and do the same raid lol
[2:46:21] theDirtyon3: fer what
[2:46:27] Lara_TV_: ~479.9 I think
[2:46:29] Avarizz: 483?
[2:46:42] Blu_ClosetGamer: Why not just have an achievement for kills with the lowest I-Level. People would go back and farm old gear. Tanks and healers would be naked
[2:46:54] kramer_1996: there is not a single site that functions worse than raider io. its so bad
[2:46:58] gonzobone: *** is my favorite site
[2:47:00] CHR0NiC11: probably 483 ish
[2:47:07] TattersAU: Too many players getting added to the dream meme stream team crashed raider IO Sadge
[2:47:11] weezie_61: it never works
[2:47:11] smolderdaddyuwu: probably mdi sign ups
[2:47:12] Thasin22: when is it working?
[2:47:12] Zorkwins: @smolderdaddyuwu Noone does world first difficulty though. You'd be pressed to find players to do that
[2:47:13] Zzekar: is that only doing to u ?
[2:47:14] CHR0NiC11: or 482.5
[2:47:15] Yungpupperz: Rio has been awful for a couple weeks
[2:47:15] Squats3: raider.io has been on and off fucked for a few weeks
[2:47:15] Ionized4: i swear it is broken all the time
[2:47:16] Zzekar: hm

[2:47:22] AoPsyke: dead
[2:47:23] ottermatic69: weakauras arent working for me at all in game and its giving me a heacache
[2:47:24] misran: rio is like the most unstable site on the internet
[2:47:29] dreamy_o: 381 i think
[2:47:32] Helo_KiX: I was just on it like 5 minutes ago lol
[2:47:34] Xann_: maybe wowprogress will have the info?
[2:47:35] dragonprayer789: to many MDI sign ups kekw
[2:47:35] Keppie__: 479.2 acording to wlogs
[2:47:37] miraagex: Maybe are organically ddosed, people are scanning/updating/whatever
[2:47:39] skitz888: bro how do you start this new questline?
[2:47:42] Zzekar: raider io and wowlogs needs to work better lmfao … its 2024 ffs
[2:47:44] Rampo123: u were 481
[2:47:48] adardrae: doesn't wowprogress track this?
[2:47:49] Rampo123: no 480~ yah
[2:47:55] Rampo123: CokeShakeyTogeth
[2:47:58] midiansgod: Good evening everyone :)
[2:47:59] alejandro7com: Looks like they're making game balance changes faster than I can keep up with my snack consumption! 😂
[2:48:01] aloken1312: tindral is a mechanic fiesta

[2:48:43] Menadar: Was it harder than fallen avatar?
[2:48:48] Rampo123: 5
[2:48:48] Zzekar: i feel like even 10k sign ups should not cause issues to an website in 2024

[3:04:29] miraagex: KEKW
[3:04:29] BLACKFOOT_TN: Bro shame on Blizzard for making bosses take more than 300 pulls.
[3:04:30] m_dep: that is so sad
[3:04:31] DreadfuryDK: KEKW alright that's a bit much
[3:04:31] ChargedParticle: What a based take
[3:04:32] 1_7_4: GIGACHAD

[3:05:05] kilkott: everybody gets a trophy!
[3:05:06] monochromator: Just kill it sooner, I dont get the issue
[3:05:08] DreadfuryDK: @BLACKFOOT_TN Nah he's right. Kinda. 300 is reasonable for endbosses but this was like 450+ and wasn't even the endboss. Tindral was fucked tbh
[3:05:10] DamagedWoW: what feels worse? not getting it and getting handed it for free, or only just having killed it but then everyone catches up straight away?

[3:05:35] skeeld: no raid
[3:05:35] furtif_69: we said no chance we're raiding after we heard of the nerfs

[3:05:44] asapdave1: waste of time
[3:05:46] JackHealMe: Sunday was a practice night for dispels
[3:05:52] Dusari: we killed it sunday
[3:05:53] Wraiyth_: @Maximum 20%, tried to finish it up but ran out of time
[3:05:53] DreadfuryDK: @Maximum We're 200+ pulls in and don't have many P2 pulls. We raided for most of last weekend anyway since we were wiping to stuff that didn't get changed significantly.
[3:05:54] starbittz: we extended and did 6 hours of it
[3:05:55] gonzobone: how good must it have felt to kill it last week though for the guilds that did?
[3:05:56] Omnomnomnivore7: we raided 2 of our 3 days then they announced the nerf as we were forming and we decided to just take it off
[3:05:57] Ryler_: @BLACKFOOT_TN wipe count doesnt mean shit when half your pulls are less than 3min, dont raid if you have weak mental
[3:06:02] saintfrancis: kinda tragic it got gutted
[3:06:06] Auphius: Yeah, we raided to have people practice flying for bombs in different groups
[3:06:08] Spinerek: getting better
[3:06:10] Oraghon: raided to see more of p2
[3:06:16] Onyo1337: yep had our first night on sunday, just for dispells and flying in p1
[3:06:17] MVPBuster: we were figuring out feather/orb stuff so thats why we kept pulling just for practice
[3:06:18] just_ie: We started our tindral prog this last sunday. Did 60 pulls in p1 and called it a night
[3:06:28] yaboyandel: we were still in p1 and hadn't seen seeds yet so we still raided thursday after nerfs were announced and saw most of p2 that night. so i thought it was pretty valuable
[3:06:34] LiterWatts: We had 60 pulls and we're still looking to perfect p1 so we raided
[3:06:36] monochromator: Old world from up high looks so jank
[3:06:36] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Ryler_ What week are we right now? How many guilds killed that boss prenerf? You still defending this? lol
[3:06:43] Parkhen: With so little Fyrakk kill at that point a giant nerf to Tindral was expected.
[3:06:44] Teepone: @Maximum We were last seeds of P2 when nerf got announced. Still raided so that we could get to see P3
[3:06:47] corbett86: is that mechanic harder than pre nerf holondrus?
[3:06:59] Throckytv: does lust change to p1 now with these changes?
[3:07:03] alejandro7com: I'm not sure what game you are watching, but it sounds like a lot of people have different opinions on it. Maybe you could comment something like this:
[3:07:13] JohnAllenCasts: @Maximum We raid wed/thur and we had 1 day to kill smold and 1 day on tindral, we didn't get out of p1 but didn't have to cancel any raid days. We did say we would have done though if we had another raid scheduled
[3:07:14] healapotamus: Would you buy a Nerf vs. Eleanore PPV cage match?
[3:07:20] Erry_tv: i think most of the 900 guilds stuck on tindral were on P2, so i think most of them are juste waiting ther nerf like my guild
[3:07:22] Keppie__: After the add nerf it wasnt too bad
[3:07:23] gonzobone: are there any bosses that have had a ton of working strats or do people mostly just do whatever liquid and echo did?
[3:07:26] healapotamus: ellesmere
[3:07:26] Onyo1337: @Throckytv I saw some logs already lusting p1 tho
[3:07:27] miraagex: @Throckytv intermission is too good not to lust in
[3:07:28] Ryler_: @BLACKFOOT_TN whos defending anything, I jsut said your 300 wipe take is terrible because it lacks context
[3:07:30] riddlemaster96: yoooooo Max any class tuning you’d like to see before season 4?
[3:07:33] DreadfuryDK: You're not even autopushing P1, right?
[3:07:37] speedey__: skip the 50 second roots maybe?
[3:07:43] Hopefulx: P1 LUST Pog #Magegang
[3:07:44] FranchoJ: !interface
[3:07:48] speedey__: just never learn that overlap
[3:07:50] Rivallry: I want your dragonriding weakaura. What isi t?
[3:07:52] BadManners_: can phasing too fast in p2 cause any issues ?
[3:07:58] Pyrrha_GG: 8 weeks no lego wahooo!!!!
[3:07:59] fleks27: not lusting p1 means you hate mages so you should never lust pullö
[3:08:05] ciggyman: @Hopefulx any good vaults
[3:08:14] emir_h113: is this your favourite zone to chill in
[3:08:17] smolderdaddyuwu: as the seeds spawn yes
[3:08:18] flem_wow: what a powerful question for the penultimate boss of the tier
[3:08:18] Lindorn_: just timings
[3:08:19] miraagex: @fleks27 true and based
[3:08:19] OnlyaOnly: p1lust is 100% better boss dmg tahn p2
[3:08:32] Aveeeeek: @OnlyaOnly its not
[3:08:54] JohnAllenCasts: depends if you lust into shield or not
[3:08:59] DreadfuryDK: They phased 2 seconds early I guess
[3:09:02] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum invisible seeds?  still wipe you??
[3:09:11] NotD4k: the shield convo again
[3:09:13] NotD4k: Aware
[3:09:14] flem_wow: people still do healer lust
[3:09:21] Byggareebob: @flem_wow def not
[3:09:24] miraagex: heal lust p2 for prog
[3:09:27] Teepone: Theres a Healer Lust Dratnos said some people use in his guide
[3:09:28] L1ghtTW: FeelsBadMan 1.15% with 456 pulls
[3:09:30] Byggareebob: only for prog not for kill
[3:09:31] cendaiii: but only for
[3:09:39] Throckytv: if you move the lust you can get more boss damage with 2 and 3mins somewhere?
[3:09:40] flem_wow: @flem_wow i dont think they should and we dont, but ik people do
[3:09:54] flem_wow: @Throckytv at 6min presumably
[3:09:58] GigaforceTV: @maximum  has anyone mentioned how scuffed the liquid mythic tindral video is?
[3:10:06] Rycrft1: what are the new changes?
[3:10:16] alejandro7com: Nice dragonriding weakaura! Where can I get one? Asking for a friend.
[3:10:46] Blackiichan_: fyrakk shield too
[3:10:53] honeychonker: @Maximum WoWhead post on the tindral nerf and also Nymue nerf
[3:10:56] Keppie__: i mean the fyrakk shield works the other way
[3:11:14] DreadfuryDK: This overlap right here might be the hardest part
[3:11:15] Leoric86: Leoric86 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:11:19] NotD4k: @Keppie__ its not a dmg amp tho Dentge
[3:11:21] DreadfuryDK: And it's pretty spooky
[3:11:29] Throckytv: right, but if you lust shield 2 on plat three, and have 3min classes hold, couldn't you have 2 and 3mins with lust on shield?
[3:11:29] ubba90: @Keppie__ his is a shield but its an intermission not the same thing
[3:11:33] honeychonker: Nymue: "Reclamation radius reduced to 8 yards (was 10 yards)."
[3:11:37] squashcwb: hey this is my ex guild!
[3:11:39] beast2: @alejandro7com its on wago
[3:11:44] miraagex: @honeychonker is it the bomb?
[3:11:44] Auphius: @NotD4k polarity is the damage amp, standing on the same charges
[3:11:53] relimee0: relimee0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months!

[3:19:11] Raggu2: Dinar for 20 vault tokens.
[3:19:12] DreadfuryDK: I'd EASILY brick multiple vaults if it meant I'd get the Myth track Iridal out of it.
[3:19:14] Zzekar: that would be such a good mvoe for M+ ....
[3:19:14] Xann_: Bro you are broke, 100g on char. XD
[3:19:14] Snipehealz: if you do it with M+ you need to do it with Raid gear

[3:19:43] Xann_: You don't have enough gold on you to repair @Maximum
[3:19:51] JohnAllenCasts: I think I prefer the hero > myth idea more. So you still have to farm the item
[3:19:52] Xarconos: @Maximum i won the lottery and got a mythic Balefire second week. but every other season was terrible vaults. feels like its a new from of Legion legendary RNG bricking
[3:19:52] iccyc0ld: 180 aspect for to upgrade to mythic track
[3:19:56] magicman133: oh yeah brick my vault buddy InuyoFace

[3:20:23] 1_7_4: auto attack ring xdd
[3:20:23] Zzekar: mayeb he indeed got it on his 101
[3:20:30] markobt: the upgrade hero -> myth makes more sense as it still incentivises you to grind to get it
[3:20:31] Zzekar: @reggiepowa
[3:20:32] spalff: i hate that i cant get the fyrakk tank trinket in the vault despite needing it for m+ as dps

[3:21:49] Ionized4: if you dont wanna do 100 dungeons for deterministic crests, you def dont want to do 100 dungeons for a chance at a trinket
[3:21:53] Drewslock: @Maximum think being able to spend weekly box tokens to upgrade a piece of loot to the next tier makes the most sense if they won't just flat out make seasonal dinar like in SL S4
[3:21:54] healapotamus: @xxoutkastedxx it is a healer trinket :)
[3:21:55] ShadesOBlue: He's a baby

[3:23:00] relimee0: council trink + oce Aware
[3:23:05] ubba90: being able to snag 2 or 3 chase items after a few weeks every patch should be every patch thing already. they fucked us on bonus rolls so should get something else

[3:24:08] RaeRizzle: What about an Icon?
[3:24:08] ubba90: beacon is massive damage. and huge mastery stat stick. so as a DH its possible
[3:24:10] Wikedlyrics: beacon is just good priority damage in M+ it was never top overall
[3:24:10] Micosj: Maybe the Neltharion trinket will be good with the new build?
[3:24:10] Rugburn__: incarnate icon?
[3:24:17] erdls: beacon was insane on brackenhide
[3:24:20] tattimies1: isnt signet brand better than augury?

[3:30:25] Squats3: upgrade item
[3:30:25] bramwow: they could upgrade it
[3:30:28] kuromebro: the dathea trinket was just literally unusable on certain bosses in s1, it is not less bad in that regard
[3:30:30] BurntToast256: yah but only upgraded them within the tier
[3:30:33] Rakim88: vendor had the regular item n boss had to drop the upgrade for leggo
[3:30:33] zlncy: bow was lootpool, whereas DF legos were questchain

[3:31:34] gfkoe: i don't think we get DF dungeons back
[3:31:36] BurntToast256: it seems like it'll be the original DF dungeons
[3:31:36] cendaiii: Fall is fine
[3:31:37] NotD4k: i like fall
[3:31:39] Squats3: @Maximum Gilneas quest is short and gives you a monocle transmog. its peak stupid.  should be able to see it in your appearances list.

[3:31:51] Jaborba: Fall trash is dog
[3:31:51] gunshinsora: they should keep Dawn of the infinite as a mega dung instead of m+ like in s2

[3:31:57] Nekz3: bring back halls form shadowlands
[3:31:57] Sover31gn: LEAK KEKWait
[3:31:58] jamesmcnasty: azure vault can rot
[3:31:58] TBouse: the platform in fall is some of the worst design there is in keys
[3:31:59] Teepone: We don't need Uldaman
[3:31:59] Squats3: i hope we dont i hated most of them
[3:32:00] timmayb166: brackenhide pleaseeeee
[3:32:00] lolFluke: no shot we don't get all DF dungs
[3:32:01] TheRealDadTV: TheRealDadTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:32:02] MBG_95: Think Rise is a bad dungeon, but the bosses are great design ideas, just bad for dungeon
[3:32:03] Wikedlyrics: they can skip azure vault and uldaman
[3:32:03] Slapsstick: falls a banger
[3:32:05] Blindsir: 100% for fated we getting all 10 DF DUNGEONS!
[3:32:05] Thad95: Academy again will be love
[3:32:06] Newlander: Rise sucks. You spend 2.5 mins just mounted and running around.
[3:32:07] NotD4k: RLP monkaW
[3:32:10] Mirror477: all mega dungeons
[3:32:11] FullOfTryxz: I like that they use old dungeons for m+, there's so much content in this game just sitting around

[3:32:12] JohnAllenCasts: AV can hole die

[3:32:17] spivet: community vote for their favorite 8 maybe?
[3:32:18] gigaerick: is rise the second half or the first half idr
[3:32:19] boomiexd: could leave out the dragonflight dungeons from s2 and they wouldnt be missed
[3:32:20] bamtic83: do you think it's too early for a shadowlands dungeon to return?
[3:32:26] lolislawl5: Make final season every dungeon LUL
[3:32:27] Haraa: i want back legion/bfa system where we all just went on vacation for tyrant week
[3:32:29] jessebona: Rise actually grew on me over time. It's difficult but highly predictable. Everbloom and its "pull half the dungeon at a time" style is infinitely worse.
[3:32:31] goombacci: rlp post nerfs was tolerable
[3:32:32] i_cassius: I like and hate fall only because I have farmed it for double time so much

[3:33:01] Standy94: Academy was sick
[3:33:02] eveecat: disagree tbh i liked most
[3:33:03] JarzakRS: Academy was nice
[3:33:04] Newlander: LET FLY!!
[3:33:04] grAv0r: i liked brackenhide
[3:33:06] Standy94: RLP is good
[3:33:09] VelouriaVR: Ruby Sanctum was terrifying

[3:33:21] MVPBuster: AV was tolerable once the skip was found lmao
[3:33:21] Biviter: Nokhud was some ass
[3:33:21] mr_sallad: Braken was lit
[3:33:21] AgrM_Gengar: still hate the last boss of Azure
[3:33:22] DanteDemonZ: Academy was the goat
[3:33:26] miraagex: @Stephy_Mariee it was. it was nerfed like week2 and became easy
[3:33:27] relimee0: in order: S, A-, C+, D, A+, A, D, B+, C
[3:33:28] Athanasius296: if u think ruby is bad ur just bad
[3:33:28] relimee0: YEP
[3:33:30] Thad95: HOI and Noku can stay gone
[3:33:30] Sover31gn: Nokhud s,aps
[3:33:30] gali5656: thunderboss in nuk was awesome
[3:33:31] spalff: based
[3:33:35] papach0ng: uldaman is giga fun on dh
[3:33:37] papach0ng: huge pulls
[3:33:38] Elindalyne: av sucked at launch
[3:33:40] conchelobe: With the skip I loved AV
[3:33:41] honeychonker: Can we talk about how Azerothian Archives is a shitty, buggy, broken mess and if this is what we are to expect from the "live" team when there's fuck all else outdoor stuff to do its unacceptable?
[3:33:44] horizondelta: nokhud was fun bruh
[3:33:45] facetheface: Nokhud mid gameplay BANGER soundtrack
[3:33:45] CoffeeASAP: I do miss centaur mommy telling me to fly every 5 seconds
[3:33:47] spalff: shadowlands had some worse dungeons but also some better dungeons than df
[3:33:50] Stephy_Mariee: ruby was dogsht you can never change my mind
[3:33:51] jvmes_r6: i miss shadowland dungies
[3:33:51] miraagex: AV/RLP week1-3 nerfs made them perfect

[3:34:02] SkunkTruck: really would prefer to never to nokuhd ever again
[3:34:02] zenruso_: fortified ruby yuck
[3:34:03] oneifbyland: @relimee0 you've had that saved on a notepad this whole xpac waiting for you chance to shine LUL
[3:34:04] dulgr_1: Ruby was sick
[3:34:08] mr_sallad: Do you think they'll do any shadowlands dungeons soon?
[3:34:08] relimee0: @relimee0 xdd
[3:34:09] alvein88: melee take

[3:34:15] Micosj: 100% melee take
[3:34:15] horizondelta: i actually really miss sshadowlands dungeons lol
[3:34:18] BadManners_: hard = bad classic
[3:34:21] tedo781: ruby was really hard until they adjusted it and I think it made some salty
[3:34:21] Clever_Husky: @honeychonker Took me 3 relogs to get it done. lol
[3:34:21] gorgorz0rt: @CoffeeASAP let fly!
[3:34:23] Nebulizer87: ruby could have been the best but to counter the short dungeon they overtuned it
[3:34:23] Bellissimo__: I liked it until the dragon fire invis bugged Sadge
[3:34:24] kesthus: @Maximum why writhebark is bad for dh?
[3:34:26] gigaerick: the only thing i don't like about ruby is that the trash before the second boss isn't a full circle, it's like 2/3rd of a circle
[3:34:34] DanteDemonZ: Algeth'ar in S is BASED, good take
[3:34:47] alejandro7com: Make final season every dungeon LUL
[3:34:47] Standy94: HOI 3rd boss is sick for healers
[3:34:49] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/ar9b1P
[3:34:50] iapaulogize: Everyone has a stigma about Ruby because it started the season way overtuned.

[3:39:04] Shadeux_PC: famous last words
[3:39:05] vepsee: push week as gromnak would say
[3:39:10] prugar: worst thing? you die inside
[3:39:11] alejandro7com: Nice moves, dog! You're really giving new meaning to 'fetching' shoes!
[3:39:11] Rhoncer: hunt icon still blue eugh
[3:39:17] eveecat: what do you think of getting a portal to the raid after getting AOTC?
[3:39:29] JohnAllenCasts: at least it's on tyranical week for bolstering
[3:39:38] facetheface: Bolstering Everbloom Aware
[3:39:39] Raggu2: Bolstering at least makes you think about things. if you dont want anything besides hp/damage increases then might as well do away with affixes
[3:39:46] Standy94: just type 28 and it will show you 27-29
[3:39:54] miraagex: @eveecat should've been done ages ago
[3:39:58] oneifbyland: stairs PepeLaugh
[3:39:58] lathandra1990: Its a cursed week
[3:39:59] Team_Spanky: Is everbloom just a dead key this week?
[3:40:07] kadashy1: everything is cursed
[3:40:28] mancer_of_shark: whats the addon to see classes already in the group and server location
[3:40:29] ciggyman: Kappa
[3:40:47] Standy94: should play human DH to break stun
[3:40:51] gigaerick: soulbound goliath might be the worst boss this season
[3:40:52] oneifbyland: Lord Blazemore GIGACHAD
[3:40:59] NotD4k: GIGACHAD no aug
[3:41:13] goombacci: aug on WM is trolling
[3:41:17] JohnAllenCasts: I feel like the tree boss stun is the worst mechanic in this season just no counterplay other than group comp
[3:41:22] Raggu2: human can
[3:41:25] Raggu2: Arms can
[3:41:25] hajrudinthegiant: odens and ava
[3:41:27] lathandra1990: They can only pre-bladestorm
[3:41:28] hajrudinthegiant: and human
[3:41:31] hajrudinthegiant: for roots
[3:41:43] Zambinga: yo max what are those headphones?
[3:41:43] Madidius: Human, Avatar, and/or Bladestorm
[3:41:49] Standy94: Just pre blur or nether
[3:41:50] Mattylight24: its cause u used to be able to stun it and break it
[3:41:52] Basic_3: We're just doing way bigger keys now I think.
[3:41:56] nightst314: The DoT is probably way stronger
[3:41:57] Raggu2: neither odyns or avatar works. its a stun. its called root but its a stun
[3:42:00] nemziac: pretty sure you could stun it
[3:42:04] Basic_3: Also dummies bring Augs in their keys and get flattened by a fake-dps
[3:42:07] Ionized4: didnt you mainly do keys in an MDI setting in BFA?
[3:42:11] JohnAllenCasts: can't preuse defensives for every instance of it either
[3:42:22] megacross: megacross subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:42:22] heisunknown: it just sucks as aug cause it really is a hinderance on tyrannical week
[3:42:26] painfll: hi u ply EU ?
[3:42:29] Basic_3: Prot paladin
[3:42:40] Mattylight24: WW time
[3:42:42] JohnAllenCasts: like if you had a warning it was gonna be on you you could pop a CD or something but it just goes on you and then it's GG
[3:42:48] convokethespirits: Warr cant get out.. its a stun
[3:42:51] castlecastles: just take a shaman they legit can solo the affix
[3:42:53] GodKingMuninn: Shaman with nature cleanse totem is ez week
[3:42:55] JohnAllenCasts: also aug does 0 damage to roots
[3:42:59] painfll: hi uer play EU ?
[3:43:02] miraagex: Roots should have cast time, so the person who gets affected can react
[3:43:04] Slapsstick: @convokethespirits bladestorm before and human
[3:43:05] Standy94: I hope he renames it to +28 with Maximum
[3:43:20] goblingher: The Witches boss were sooooo scary in bfa
[3:43:20] healapotamus: good spriest can solo afflicted with 3 buttons
[3:43:21] Basic_3: @JohnAllenCasts Just be a class that can use a defensive while you're stunned because of stupid PvP reasons
[3:43:25] Raggu2: The best warrior can do is pre bladestorm and rng get chosen. And jump into def stance for each one.
[3:43:37] Aquadriel: hope they buff aug
[3:43:52] JohnAllenCasts: just have the aug get rooted 8 times in the fight ez
[3:44:00] Micosj: @Aquadriel Bait used to be believable
[3:44:06] alejandro7com: Pretty sure you could stun it.
[3:44:11] Alectheacrobat: Alectheacrobat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! sheesh
[3:44:12] Rhoncer: @Maximum can we see new hunt real quick
[3:44:21] JohnAllenCasts: @Aquadriel I hope they send aug to the farm with wide open planes for them to run around in
[3:44:21] barkbitten: when keys got high in last season of BFA you also had corruptions light Twilight dev and all grps had a firemage that instantmelt everythingwith ignite
[3:44:23] JCruzie: IT'S GREEN
[3:44:29] ciggyman: it sucks
[3:44:30] Storrs_: and decree
[3:44:30] goombacci: is bursting a bleed or magic dmg?
[3:44:31] Hred5: looks cool tbh
[3:44:32] cannibalcanyon: way better
[3:44:32] KaisenSiru: Pog
[3:44:33] Parentosx: sounds so different as well
[3:44:34] ciggyman: it sounds dumb
[3:44:35] Elindalyne: the sound is terrible
[3:44:35] ibjorgi: it does chaos damage now
[3:44:35] xxoutkastedxx: all of the covenent abilities
[3:44:37] painfll: gg
[3:44:37] kuromebro: changed a bunch of old covenant spells yeah, its good
[3:44:37] Rhoncer: icon still blue though heh
[3:44:38] Raggu2: Oh wow, new hunt is gross
[3:44:41] headninja1ncharge: what I missed it
[3:44:42] zeitgeiz: it’s chaos damage now
[3:44:43] iccyc0ld: They changed it
[3:44:52] Rakim88: all covenant abilities got changed to class look
[3:44:56] keyastos: not whitelisted
[3:44:56] Elindalyne: not yet
[3:44:57] painfll: yes
[3:44:59] Shpicey: check out elysian decree
[3:44:59] panacer: it still doesnt work with the mastery
[3:44:59] SVT_Dexter: it isn't affected by your mastery
[3:44:59] Basic_3: Didn't you have a thing that made all your damage Chaos already?
[3:45:02] JCruzie: No, doesn't scale off mastery
[3:45:03] dozure: @Maximum someone said it wasnt whitelisted for mastery
[3:45:03] Raggu2: I thought mastery was your best stat
[3:45:04] Standy94: It already was chaos with the talent
[3:45:05] ibjorgi: they updated almost all the covenant abilities to work with the classes now
[3:45:08] sheckles: doesnt matter you already take a talent that makes mastery work with it
[3:45:12] JCruzie: Just works with any means necessary though
[3:45:12] Elindalyne: the dh mastery is a whitelist, it hasn't been added to the mastery yet
[3:45:16] tattimies1: doesnt mastery increase nature damage aswell with any means necessary?
[3:45:17] JCruzie: so 80% so no net change
[3:45:18] panacer: probably bug
[3:45:18] Elindalyne: its a mistake
[3:45:19] Entelligenz: would be a huge buff
[3:45:20] Entelligenz: otherwise
[3:45:21] iAruban: it already did choas cus of talent no?
[3:45:22] JackOfAllApocalypses: almost certainly a mistake
[3:45:23] Frostburnt: also the dot still does nature and not chaos
[3:45:23] Elindalyne: the dot is still nature
[3:45:24] Raggu2: its a cosmetic change, so probly intentional
[3:45:26] ctops2000: @Basic_3 anything converted by that talent only gets 80% benefit from mastery
[3:45:26] keyastos: the dot is still nature, so mistakes all around
[3:45:28] sheckles: you take any means necessary anyways max
[3:45:31] Elindalyne: just the initial hit is chaos
[3:45:33] OnlyaOnly: they didnt wanna f with the balancing, only visual
[3:45:35] miraagex: @Raggu2 YEP
[3:45:37] Parentosx: didnt any means necessary change it?
[3:45:48] sheckles: read your capstones @Maximum
[3:45:49] JCruzie: You get 80% of your mastery from AMN
[3:45:52] JCruzie: So it's the exact same
[3:45:57] magicman133: any means necessary ALREADY MAKES IT CHAOS
[3:46:03] Parentosx: because it was nature
[3:46:12] sheckles: one is leech the other is its dot damage max
[3:46:20] Storrs_: 2 different debuff
[3:46:22] sheckles: read the skill
[3:46:24] Raggu2: One is a debuff right, the healing one?
[3:46:24] Guukkii: Root, leech and dot
[3:46:26] ctops2000: the other stack is the leech effect hunt has
[3:46:26] Rhoncer: one heals you
[3:46:29] Wikedlyrics: leech buff on primary target
[3:46:30] ctops2000: you leech from the primary target
[3:46:32] Entelligenz: its the leech
[3:46:33] zlncy: second stack is a "you get x healing"
[3:46:34] magicman133: the hunt does another debuff that gives the heal
[3:46:48] Storrs_: one is the dot. one is leech. one is a root. they look like 3 stacks on frames
[3:47:07] Elindalyne: the hunt is already affect by mastery with any means necessary, having it actually work with mastery out of the box would just make it get 20% more value from mastery
[3:47:07] rawmins: rawmins subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:47:10] magicman133: read any means necessary
[3:47:16] Team_Spanky: Aint no one joining your group son
[3:47:23] Shikoroh: why the icon didn'"t change color tho
[3:47:38] Imolate_: @Maximum show elysian decree, changed it too PauseChamp
[3:47:45] puppythemonke: puppythemonke subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[3:47:47] Standy94: Ya The Hunt is under tuned
[3:47:58] JohnAllenCasts: that's a boomie I think
[3:48:03] notskyithtv: hi max am i crazy in thinking that raid shouldnt have rare item drops
[3:48:29] d0mezg4mer: rare items felt pretty good this season
[3:48:36] Tehblured: The legendary drop chance is cringe
[3:48:39] goombacci: S1 bow was fucking unbearable
[3:48:39] MofasaPrime: Pips is more rare than any of the rare items for my raid team..
[3:48:44] jessebona: Raids have probably always had rare drops, let's face it. They just didn't announce it before now.
[3:48:47] gergrunt: rare items are dope. whatchumean
[3:48:48] cendaiii: they werent easy to get last patch
[3:49:01] CocoNoooot: I've never seen the neck drop
[3:49:01] markobt: pips issue is that everyone can get it and/or needs it
[3:49:02] erasedpaulski: meanwhile volc nec hasnt dropped once on hc+mythic for us since release xD
[3:49:05] Zoi888: Raz mythic bow round 2 S4 fffff
[3:49:07] wommy: i love last raid and this one because i can make my own heroic pugs and clear so easily
[3:49:08] notskyithtv: i have raided every week and still havent seen a single rageheart
[3:49:11] miraagex: they're truly rare. we saw 1 neck and 0 staffs so far from the raid
[3:49:18] kuromebro: the agi weapon last tier was a good super rare one
[3:49:23] mfalc: season one you could target rare items in vault
[3:49:25] cendaiii: yeah but echo trinkets were also 1/4
[3:49:38] SlanDk: ive had 5 augury hc drops and 1 signet brands, we reclear every week since launch
[3:49:39] cmp_x: pips doesnt exist lol
[3:49:53] Pado99: Ive gotten pips in almost every vault, my guild wants to murder me lol
[3:49:55] Standy94: Are you hype for fated Rizzygath? lol
[3:49:59] Basic_3: Rare items seem good this patch.
[3:50:11] cendaiii: but imagine you're pugging HC every week to get the warlock for example
[3:50:15] cendaiii: thats gonna be hard af
[3:50:22] Basic_3: Although there are a bunch of non-rare weapons off the last boss with rare-style abilities so idk
[3:50:29] enigmasvea: fated SoO thoooo
[3:50:29] Ryler_: atleast its so nerfed its probably going to be a cakewalk
[3:50:35] SlanDk: what doesnt sound fun is echo of neltharion without the bg map
[3:50:35] NotD4k: Rasz P1 is prob the worst p1 I ever progged
[3:50:36] mino661: how does fated work? do we have all 3 raids at the same time?
[3:50:39] vanquishq8: i didnt play her but plz no 10 mins fight
[3:50:39] ibjorgi: Raza seems even worse to do since both of the other two end bosses this xpac are so much better
[3:50:40] Asuo_: yeah mythic can stay in the bin please
[3:50:40] zeitgeiz: I liked heroic raz a ton
[3:50:40] cendaiii: facts
[3:50:44] zomboyyd: truly
[3:50:45] Standy94: I hope fated Raz is just double knockback speed
[3:50:46] justmorm: id rather wipe with sandpaper than do mythic raz
[3:50:47] Elindalyne: mythic raz just makes me want to afk til war within
[3:50:56] alejandro7com: @Pado99 can you share some of your luck with me? I've been farming vaults for weeks and still no pips :(
[3:51:01] chubbytheboi: Arguably LFR Razsageth was harder than Mythic
[3:51:04] Cyberkaia_: i dont even remember how raz fight was
[3:51:10] Spaazzm: but if fated is what it was, isnt it gna be steamroll? I remember fated was pisseasy back in SL no?
[3:51:11] Shuage: A scaly boy
[3:51:13] mino661: @chubbytheboi +
[3:51:17] Bloodfoox: u have a warrior, so u just have some of the most utility there is
[3:51:20] Storrs_: paladin and druid just have to dispell
[3:51:25] miraagex: mage is needed for that key+affix
[3:51:26] Standy94: Raz is the only boss I saw full deter stacks in lfr lol
[3:51:32] justpeacealways: you only need 2 dispels for afflicted, itsn ot hard
[3:51:36] stiles_xd: how do ppl like sark more than raza, sark is litertally just some glofiried evoker minion zzzz
[3:51:37] Pado99: @alejandro7com I wish. its dogwater for warriors so it rots every week in the vault T_T
[3:51:38] healapotamus: spriest can handle it
[3:51:41] tisiwonz: Just play mage for afflicted and u dont worry about the thorns ever either
[3:51:42] Fenr1g: shamans are goated for afflicted too
[3:51:44] lathandra1990: Some dungeons you need 3
[3:51:49] Helo_KiX: I solo afflicted as enhance
[3:51:51] erasedpaulski: my problem with fated is all the ''setup bosses''. like figuring out wtf u do with splitting raid, or weakaura bs is so lame
[3:51:59] healapotamus: heal 1 dispel the other
[3:51:59] nellfin: sin rogue got a 5 target soothe, kinda nice but not great x,x
[3:51:59] Basic_3: The issue with Afflicted is mostly when the dungeon requires other dispels.
[3:52:03] Basic_3: like Bloom or Timeways boss
[3:52:05] Standy94: @maximum you can use first aid on afflicted
[3:52:06] chefdejour82: resto shaman drops poison totem
[3:52:06] justpeacealways: pally and druid
[3:52:07] lathandra1990: If you've got dungeons with dispel mechanics you sometimes need a 3rd
[3:52:13] Asuo_: shaman with poison totem also cranks it but it's not a high key spec
[3:52:16] Thirdheaven: ret can handle it
[3:52:16] kingpeace09: easy for mage
[3:52:22] Karkesis: low key my least favorite thing about afflicted is how hard the things are to see/notice without addons
[3:52:24] Wyvenn: It's afflicted and what's the other affix?
[3:52:29] Basic_3: Rogues could AoE soothe but you'll never catch one being a moral member of society.
[3:52:32] neighclaw: cant believe that our raid tank in in your group
[3:52:35] Ridsyx: 3 ppl in your group can deal with it tho
[3:52:42] Micosj: It feels like it's bolstering or bursting every other week
[3:52:44] Karkesis: Aware
[3:52:44] tykus21: shit
[3:52:44] Bloodfoox: oh
[3:52:46] Standy94: Just use bandages on afflicted
[3:52:47] Bloodfoox: so ITS PUSH WEEK
[3:52:47] agnarz: bolstering Pog
[3:52:49] Wyvenn: ewww
[3:52:54] vepsee: what would be cool is if they capped raid difficulty at heroic for fated raids but they add affixes that alter the fight so you arent necessarily reprogging mythic again but its still a challenge without the annoying shit? idk spontaneous idea im just a lurker
[3:52:57] vepsee: chat
[3:53:03] erdls: bolstering is a bit better on tyran
[3:53:09] Cakerinotv: Cakerinotv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Yuh
[3:53:35] Pado99: @vepsee they tried raid affixes in shadowlands and it was so fucking bad. no way they bring that crap back

[3:53:41] iAruban: can you pre shadowmeld the root
[3:53:54] Rhoncer: tree boss

[3:55:16] Zarroe: it goes on cd
[3:55:16] NorthernSM: goes on cd
[3:55:17] MVPBuster: its on CD
[3:55:21] keyastos: dont second eye beam
[3:55:21] neighclaw: molgor is so nervous that you are in his key
[3:55:22] justottey: meta resets your eyebeam
[3:55:22] murloc_oracle: only eyebeam once
[3:55:25] murloc_oracle: and reset with meta
[3:55:30] sauron644: Yeah 2min or longer resets
[3:55:32] miraagex: @iAruban theoretically possible when done within the same server tick, but before the roots were initiated by the server. but no idea
[3:55:34] wommy: if someone with this mog joins my key im worried
[3:55:37] neighclaw: hes our raid lead tank
[3:55:37] willeblam: eye beam meta only
[3:55:48] cmp_x: lol

[4:03:42] seabs11: non verbal inc
[4:03:49] Suited_Monkey: @SlanDk Yeah that's kinda my biggest issue, I feel like I have little way of contributing to CC/interrupts as soon as mobs live long like in fort weeks on DK
[4:03:55] goombacci: I mean I dont want all my buttons to be the same color I am glad they are still blue

[4:23:11] Facinelli: go your own key
[4:23:15] ciggyman: molgor beast mode
[4:23:22] GoaGifflar: wait why does group finder give you a bunch of 26s when you search 27
