[0:03:15] KingfisherGames: @HazelNuttyGames  have we figured out how that thing drops yet? is it off the boss once weekly? is it from the bundles that you get while doing the event?
[0:03:24] Ujai321: where do you get that giant dragon pet? oh, it's just a guard...
[0:03:39] tempestmellinger1901: !drop

[0:05:29] Dunedain1305: Hey Hazel!

[0:05:43] KingfisherGames: I'm pretty good, I'm only 2 pieces of gear away from getting the full heroic armor set from Amirdrassil
[0:05:50] Zuldak: Suramar...
[0:05:55] IndigoCat: Crinkle is an awesome name for a gnome
[0:06:00] gemcutie: hazelWave hazelWave hazelWave
[0:06:24] Zuldak: Yay for complaints
[0:06:28] Ujai321: good thing that you have nothing but good memories of Suramar Kappa
[0:06:30] MattFedUp: Love suramar
[0:06:31] dvkJoe: There she is, Bubblegum-Hazel, nice!
[0:06:33] samdra1990: Hello Hazel!  How's you?  :D
[0:06:50] tayno239: Hello glad see you Hazel!
[0:06:54] wolfcloudchaser80: Complaining actually works. I always notice my drop chance improves after a sincere, heartfelt complaint.
[0:07:09] Zuldak: So it's been a long time but it's not impossible you need a withered army training because I remember there being a carrying max for the ancient mana
[0:07:20] witchhobbit: happy sunday!!!
[0:07:23] Daemavand: Suramar is LONG
[0:07:32] Daemavand: it was good... the first time
[0:07:37] MattFedUp: got my aotc 2 weeks ago and keystone master last week now time for that gladiator mount even though ive never pvped
[0:07:39] KingfisherGames: I dislike Suramar because I have such a pain in the ass trying to get into the raid
[0:07:42] mjsage: mjsage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:07:42] Streamlabs: mjsage just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:08:26] nyrhalahotep: yeah, I really enjoyed that whole zone and story
[0:08:49] witchhobbit: @KingfisherGames once you go often enough, you'll know it exactly. i had that experience in the beginning lol
[0:08:49] Daemavand: Only stubborness is required :D
[0:09:07] Zuldak: The big rumors are about the old pandaria aotc mount possibly coming back
[0:09:42] witchhobbit: i got the ve'nari paragon mount in 2 attempts. feels very nice lol
[0:09:52] witchhobbit: i'm hoping i don't need anything else from that
[0:09:59] Daemavand: For something like Glad, I think the way to do it is to pursue it because you genuinely adore PVP/arena, and you naturally work there as a result of that passion
[0:10:09] Daemavand: rather than the other way around of going after the reward
[0:10:29] KulMital: why does it even upset people?
[0:10:32] witchhobbit: lolll
[0:10:49] evosce: !drops

[0:10:49] accio_coffee: rage quit! lol
[0:11:00] Gurottesquex: A lot of ppl are being reeeaaally nasty about it. Its kind of sad to see
[0:11:17] witchhobbit: you're never going to make everyone happy and on that note too, not everyone is going to like you. life lessons 101
[0:11:18] Gurottesquex: More people seem to be okay with it than not okay with it tho
[0:11:27] randolph_carter90: wow hazel, your hair is magnificent. i love the gradient. did you do it yourself or did you go to the hairdresser?
[0:11:39] KingfisherGames: I saw someone put it this way: that they wouldn't mind it coming back but make it like a timewalking raid reward, rather than TP
[0:11:50] KingfisherGames: and as someone who loves using the trading post to get mounts, I can respect that
[0:11:53] Zuldak: I have the mount. I would like it tied to time walking activity more than just trading post. I'm fine with it coming back
[0:11:59] Kurama__95: To me the only upsetting part is the acquisition being boring. Make us run through a Timewalking scaled SoO that awards it, not just buy it off the TP
[0:12:02] Tallgeese12: Is this over TCG stuff?
[0:12:04] witchhobbit: @Gurottesquex i think so. you're going to see the anger more
[0:12:25] randolph_carter90: i tried to do a gradient myself once but it became terrible lol
[0:12:39] fuoroni: I wouldn't say I'm upset but i do feel like giving away an AOTC mount on the trading post is very different from giving away a TCG mount
[0:12:42] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:12:42] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:12:44] wolfcloudchaser80: I think "exclusivity" should only apply for a few years. People had all that time to lord it over whoever they wanted.
[0:12:47] Gurottesquex: @haleych Yeah thats so true. They always seem the loudest.
[0:12:47] Daemavand: ohhhhh sweet glorious Chipolte
[0:13:06] Gurottesquex: Aww kitty D:
[0:13:07] Ujai321: "i like your hair, hazel." - "thanks, it's not for sale."
[0:13:07] mcxoney: mcxoney watched 15 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! as someone whos kinda upset about this i feel like my collectables that i tried hard for now losing its value and as an old player i get nothing valuable to keep that shows im an old player
[0:13:07] nyrhalahotep: the hairstyle does suit you exceedingly well
[0:13:10] Ujai321: except this one is !
[0:13:16] eielwind: a slippery can of worms if you will
[0:13:28] KingfisherGames: I am hoping for the wooly rhino to get brought back in either twitch drops or trading post Cheer10
[0:13:28] Zuldak: Yeah the mount was an award for in game activity and it should be re rewarded for in game activities. That's alll
[0:13:28] Streamlabs: kingfishergames has donated 10 bits!
[0:13:29] randolph_carter90: ooohh wow, i never would've guessed
[0:13:33] accio_coffee: Kitty!
[0:13:34] OlsargeTV: !wig might be one of the most amusing chat commands i've ever seen
[0:13:35] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:13:37] nyrhalahotep: @Ujai321 😂😂😂😂😂
[0:13:50] evosce: I actually forgot you have short hair and just thought "oh yeah thats hazel ...with long hair. seems right."
[0:13:59] eielwind: im not sure its quite as agregious as if they were to give away say, the old naxx Immortal mount or something
[0:14:20] Kurama__95: @Zuldak This tbh
[0:14:23] wolfcloudchaser80: For instance, I had the Spirit of Competition dragonling pet... that could only have been obtained during the 2008 (I think?) Olympic, making it fairly rare now. They recently put it on the trading post and now everyone has it.
[0:14:24] Zuldak: The hair was part of the branding of the show
[0:14:24] nyrhalahotep: I did find this which quest a bit confusing, though
[0:14:51] nyrhalahotep: witch=
[0:14:54] MisterBongwater: I switched to arcane from frost and now I want to play nightborne again lol, damn you suramar
[0:15:17] MisterBongwater: am I alone in hating glacial spike tho?
[0:15:21] tehl00py: couldn't imagine the amount of bleach it would take to get to that blonde ><
[0:15:31] blissy416: i mean, you were still able to have it and it be exclusive for like 15-ish years. i dont think it hurts that everyone can have it now
[0:15:38] raephira: /tar ?
[0:15:38] nyrhalahotep: go to the middle and grab the crystals
[0:15:42] witchhobbit: @MisterBongwater no, i don't really like frost haha
[0:15:50] Daemavand: @tehl00py It takes me two passes as someone with naturally medium brown hair lol
[0:16:07] medvet03: Just walk toward the middle area where the dead tree is and the spirits will pop up.
[0:16:36] Ujai321: funnily enough, this hair is pretty anime
[0:16:39] nyrhalahotep: grab the crystals in the middl
[0:16:48] MisterBongwater: @haleych if it wasn't for the tier set focusing on it, i might still play it. but I switched to arcane and feel like I got my mobility back
[0:16:48] Zuldak: Anime hair does not conform to the laws of phsyics. Have you seen Yu Gi Oh?!
[0:17:04] Gurottesquex: It does give a little bit of magical girl hair vibes
[0:17:09] WhippWhapp: o/ Happy Sunday!
[0:17:27] sibimi: hi Hazel! that wig looks sooo god on you, that's my fave one so far hazelShiny  hope you'll have an amazing stream and lovely day!
[0:17:41] tehl00py: @Daemavand it's when it's so close to the scalp that scares me, the few times i bleached i didn't know what i was doing and definitely burned myself haha
[0:17:56] Daemavand: @tehl00py Oof thats not good!
[0:18:11] WhippWhapp: @sibimi I concur! <3
[0:18:34] eielwind: hazel, did you ever have the issue where you aren'ty able to see the target circle on your minimap?
[0:18:46] KingfisherGames: you know, i think i have a candidate for most satisfying solo in wow
[0:18:55] Zuldak: maybe im not too attached to the AOTC mounts because ive literally paid for carries since they started in Pandaria
[0:18:57] KingfisherGames: Valithria Dreamwalker in ICC
[0:19:14] nyrhalahotep: files it away in her mind vault
[0:19:40] WhippWhapp: WhippWhapp watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:19:56] randolph_carter90: i remember when i colored my hair black and wanted to do another color after a while. i had no experience with this kind of stuff and after trying to bleach the hair it came out orange and i had to run around as ginger for a while, it was hilarious xD
[0:20:06] eielwind: was aotc more "prestigious" back in the day than it is now?
[0:20:07] KingfisherGames: what is it anyway? some wolf?
[0:20:19] witchhobbit: yeah thats a good point, a lot of people also just pay for carries for these mounts anyway
[0:20:22] averageteacup: watching this makes me miss Suramar and Legion
[0:20:31] tehl00py: @randolph_carter90 classic first timer moment. i definitely rocked some orange hair in my teens XP
[0:20:39] Zuldak: I do hope we get more story between Thalrisra and Lorthamar's romance
[0:20:52] Ujai321: you are much taller than Amy Lee
[0:20:59] KingfisherGames: @eielwind I do know that SOO was the first raid with a mythic tier
[0:21:05] Gurottesquex: My hair has been black with box dye for so many years Im not sure I could even get it out of the hair anymore lol
[0:21:09] Zuldak: Did you ever wear the giant goth platform boots?
[0:21:17] OlsargeTV: we've all had phases. i did the frosted tips once.
[0:21:37] eielwind: I've been sitting at the Palworld start screen debating continuing or starting over again
[0:21:47] tehl00py: @OlsargeTV with y2k being as big as it is rn, i'm somewhat bummed these did not come back
[0:21:51] Zuldak: they call em highlights now not streaks
[0:21:59] MattFedUp: weird idea but this got me thinking legion what if elunanaria is the blue child and anaria means child its the second moon daughter of elune
[0:22:03] Daemavand: I had a friend in high school that used to color her tips with a bingo market every day lol
[0:22:07] Daemavand: *marker
[0:22:20] WhippWhapp: New Nvidia drivers out today
[0:22:22] Zuldak: so more of a scene kid?
[0:22:23] Ujai321: until now!
[0:22:37] wolfcloudchaser80: Now you could get a vivid green wig and treat it as a green screen. Animated rainbow hair!
[0:22:44] tehl00py: @Daemavand we did what we could then. my friends would use koolaid :')
[0:22:59] TheBenXO: The Hardy Boyz sleeves lol
[0:23:05] Daemavand: @tehl00py It worked real well lol
[0:23:06] witchhobbit: yes emo came before
[0:23:06] averageteacup: Steampunk was every where at one point
[0:23:13] Zuldak: I graduated 05 and scene kid was new as i was leaving
[0:23:30] randolph_carter90: @wolfcloudchaser80 great idea, i love it
[0:23:32] KingfisherGames: I went to a high school where dying your hair black was against the dress code
[0:23:38] Gurottesquex: I remember the white out on nails, omg. Or sharpie for black nails.
[0:23:41] Ujai321: i have never heard "scene kid" in my life
[0:23:46] cashthb: what's cookin'?
[0:23:48] Zuldak: hot topic was happy either way
[0:24:05] Daemavand: I forgot about white-out omg
[0:24:07] Perkolate: lmao i remember this moment from the legion beta
[0:24:18] mozelac: @KingfisherGames same, a girl witch natural black hair got in trouble her mom brought the whole fam out LOL. the rule didnt exist anymore after that
[0:24:19] GreenArrowed: my sharpies were reserved for writing lyrics on my converse
[0:24:25] mozelac: with*
[0:24:42] Ujai321: lol, get bubbled
[0:25:02] cashthb: best ending didn't have to play sl
[0:25:23] Zuldak: did you ever go to school dances?
[0:25:31] MaddiDJ4: I had purple streaks in my hair in middle school. I was homeschooled though, I think it was part of the bribe to get me to go to online school. I was always told the school wouldn’t like it because it was distracting. but later on I went red and purple and black. almost went pink more recently
[0:25:32] GreenArrowed: white converse covered in lyrics with red and black laces. my uniform.
[0:25:34] manoomu: i had a friend in hs with a small business of customizing other people's shoes
[0:25:53] cashthb: 'membe when rainbows were fair game?
[0:26:11] russtrotter: all this re-do of suramar makes me feel is the hope that warbands in the next xpac address these retreads
[0:26:35] tildo03: I joined just in time for "shoe talk"
[0:26:39] Ujai321: and your dog absolutely loves mud
[0:26:47] thunderdorked: just got in something about dirty shoes.. lol
[0:26:52] Zuldak: there was something special about school and the breaks between class being sort of enforced socialization
[0:26:59] cashthb: told ya before, go for classic reeboks, they look better with wear
[0:27:15] Zuldak: Moose is a mud puppy
[0:27:30] thunderdorked: when i was 13 my mom bought me brand new clothes for my bday and me and my best friend went to the creek got all mudy and mom whooped my a$$..
[0:27:43] MiguelGamma: what was fun was not realizing til your 30's that  you were an emo kid
[0:27:59] tehl00py: you get your white sneakers that are meant to get dirty, then your white sneakers for fancier events (going to the movies)
[0:28:02] msmester1: wow a new one now hazel is the cameleon :D
[0:28:06] Ujai321: for weddings and jails
[0:28:35] Zuldak: i prefer flipflops or sandals always
[0:29:10] tehl00py: @Zuldak this is the true way. if i could just wear chacos or slides year round, awesome
[0:29:21] cashthb: btw might be something on my mind but you're real-ly quiet  - now seriously
[0:30:04] valianya: Wait, you can dragonride in broken isles??  I thought it was just Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms
[0:30:10] Zuldak: youre fine for me
[0:30:13] cashthb: same
[0:30:20] Daemavand: Aye good!
[0:30:27] Ujai321: did you know that Birkenstock is now part of LVMH (which is Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton)
[0:30:30] wolfcloudchaser80: Audio seems normal to me
[0:31:04] msmester1: i still have suramar quests on my mage i have no idea why, i was maybe trying to unlock the nightborne 🤔
[0:31:12] Ujai321: because birkenstock is cute and cosy, and LVMH is anything but. but it makes sense, it's all high priced luxury items
[0:31:20] cashthb: little Oregon based german shoe company
[0:31:44] bfmv73: New to the whole twitch experience. I've been following you  you on Youtube for years and now here! I am a fellow Canadian! Hoping to learn a few tricks from Twitch vids about WoW!
[0:32:02] russtrotter: there was a birk store in my town.. sold .. nothing .. but .. birks
[0:32:24] MattFedUp: after first 2 solo shuffles ever just did 5/6 and 4/6
[0:32:35] bfmv73: sounds like a blast lol
[0:32:35] Zuldak: welcome to the stream where we celebrate clever meat
[0:32:51] witchhobbit: saaaame LOL
[0:32:54] msmester1: who says you cant stream in a dress ? :D
[0:33:03] Ujai321: you look pretty stylish
[0:33:06] cashthb: you should look into the youtube channel "rose anvil"
[0:33:12] Daemavand: My indulgence for the sweats-and-comfy-clothes-lifestyle are fun t-shirts
[0:33:22] Daemavand: the more colorful, the better
[0:33:30] OlsargeTV: we have a sign in our laundry room that says no outfit is complete without dog hair
[0:33:46] tehl00py: hate having to dress up to go to the office 2x a week lol
[0:34:13] MisterBongwater: i cannot carry it for oculeth BUT I CAN CARRY YOU
[0:34:18] msmester1: doing this on a small race probably look sfunny
[0:34:22] Daemavand: It just doesn't feel like you, and thats fine
[0:34:38] Daemavand: I want snacks
[0:34:42] 1nightplays: i gave a full setup on my bad 2 ultrawide monitors, super comfy. highly recommend
[0:34:46] russtrotter: @MisterBongwater well done reference!! hahaha
[0:34:47] Daemavand: btw was the cake well received?
[0:34:48] MisterBongwater: jeez oculeth you've put on a pound, skip dessert next time whew
[0:35:52] msmester1: aint there a sell junk button or is that only in dragonflight?
[0:35:57] Daemavand: Nice :D
[0:36:31] sibimi: I think they did! you have it on the vendor npc you want to sell the junk to
[0:36:40] Kretyn: Yeah it's baseline now
[0:36:41] JohntheBarbarian: have yah tried "vendor" out?
[0:37:06] d34dlyd0g: Yeah, there's a built-in sell junk button now. But I'm guessing you get further customization with addons
[0:37:36] JohntheBarbarian: very carpel tunnel inducing to sell them one at a time, feel that
[0:38:15] Lunarphor: I usually give up andd just sell everything in my bags
[0:38:16] cashthb: most of the quest in suramar are pretty modern artsy, no idea why people like it
[0:38:26] Zuldak: ive misclicked to equip an old weapon and then sold my actual main weapon before >.>
[0:38:44] msmester1: same wow that comes with prepatch
[0:38:58] d34dlyd0g: There's a distinct strength in being able to set it up at one point in time and then you can just chill later, when your brain doesn't want to work.
[0:39:09] bogworsek: !dops
[0:39:13] Maievx: good to see u again hazel <3

[0:39:17] msmester1: when this area changed during questing it was so mindblowing
[0:40:05] accio_coffee: more kitty less Suramar :-)
[0:40:12] GreenArrowed: went for a dip
[0:40:14] KodiakJedi: Cat went swimming.
[0:40:20] Zuldak: does Kira still demand to drink shower leg water?
[0:40:32] cinnatoasto_: SInce we have so many types of "buffs" coming in as "15% more xp while levelling" etc, I would like something that would encourage people to farm more old content for mounts. What about a buff that raises the droprate with like.. 10% during holidays. etc?
[0:41:05] witchhobbit: that is what my cat does hahaha
[0:41:10] rtsplanner: did you say recently that there was a new alt gear vendor somewhere? thanks
[0:41:14] heldtheline: They're just making sure you don't drown. They're looking out for ya
[0:41:15] GreenArrowed: my friend's new kitten does not approve of closed doors, so that's been fun for us
[0:41:20] cashthb: yuck, cat was pretty yucky too but dog lick is nasty after shower
[0:41:39] strikker67: finally got the silverwind larion
[0:42:04] Ujai321: you love puzzles
[0:42:48] Zuldak: woo i got a sack of coins from the dreamwarden rep. 16k coins aint to bad
[0:43:51] Unrezolved: minimap hover maybe?
[0:43:55] cinnatoasto_: I'm pretty sure people would still farm the rest of the year, as 10% (or less) never is a guaranteed drop. I have been farming some mounts since Wrath, and they still haven't dropped for me. I'm moving into insanity territory.
[0:43:56] Zuldak: you just have to put 2 beams on each
[0:44:09] drawe: @HazelNuttyGames the one you completed is glowing look
[0:44:19] Uinen: Blue line down the middle of the one that is done
[0:44:25] MrSonicgen: Hiya.
[0:44:33] OlsargeTV: they light up or something once you do them dont they?
[0:44:35] Zuldak: you got this
[0:44:40] valianya: The active ones are lit up with a vertical line
[0:44:40] WillWonkaa: Ohh I remember this crap
[0:45:04] Daemavand: Agreed, feeling dumb is never fun
[0:45:16] msmester1: oh this quest yeah
[0:45:19] Daemavand: (you're not dumb but it makes sense why puzzles make people feel that way)
[0:45:34] valianya: Hazel the ones you already activated are lit up with a vertical line
[0:45:50] wolfcloudchaser80: I generally feel the same way. Usually about doing math while being observed
[0:45:53] msmester1: i just watched a yt video on when i did this LUL
[0:46:08] Degenerative: Degenerative subscribed with Prime. 
[0:46:08] Streamlabs: degenerative just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:46:17] Zuldak: how i thought of this is that you have to go through every possible combination of these pillar things
[0:46:58] Zuldak: DK is the slowest class... oof
[0:47:15] Zuldak: DK and priest
[0:47:47] Kretyn: priest at least as the bubble
[0:48:24] Aviendha09: Im late to the party, what are you doing is this part of the map?
[0:48:30] Zuldak: what is your max ancient mana capacity? you might need to do things to get it to 500
[0:48:47] Zuldak: ahh cool
[0:49:09] Zuldak: look on the bright side, you dont need to grow the mana tree from the seed. thats time gated for like a month
[0:50:11] scrambledbrainz: are those fire pants youre wearing?
[0:50:12] Aviendha09: Ah, class mount! outch, that will take some time
[0:50:21] Zuldak: the tree cures their addiction
[0:50:24] InakaUk: Argh I need to do legion mounts but I just don't have the motivation
[0:50:30] msmester1: this questline is so good tho
[0:51:20] Zuldak: you know what grinds my gears? The dreamsurge replacing the dragon riding purse with the essence
[0:51:48] Ujai321: "I'm here to lead, not to read." - hazelnuttygames
[0:52:13] Ujai321: it is from the Simpsons movie. president Arnold Schwarzenegger said it
[0:52:14] Zuldak: 10
[0:52:20] IAmScarlett__: hello hazel
[0:52:20] ahnn112: im sick of the dragon riding mounts i swear they said 10.2.5 was other mounts
[0:52:20] Zuldak: they give you 10 rather than 500 gold Madge
[0:52:22] IAmScarlett__: i am here
[0:52:26] InakaUk: @zuldak omg is that I thing?! I was wondering where my bags went
[0:52:48] IAmScarlett__: @ahnn112 nope they said the war within prepatch
[0:52:54] msmester1: i was suprised when i did the gilneas quest they gave you a skip otion on dialuge even the whole quest is so short
[0:53:16] Ujai321: did you watch the japanese The Ring films, by any chance?
[0:53:25] Darkalex175: Looking forward to druid flight form getting it, but the prepatch should be pretty insane if they actually include the hundreds they said they would
[0:53:25] IAmScarlett__: how was ur day hazel
[0:53:30] Postaldave: which mount you currently working on?
[0:53:30] IAmScarlett__: @Ujai321 the horror series?
[0:53:47] IAmScarlett__: @Postaldave paladin class order hall mount!
[0:53:49] d34dlyd0g: They have to re-rig a ton of animation if I were to guess. That's why it takes so much time.
[0:53:54] cashthb: maybe blanchy also gets dragon riding
[0:53:57] Zuldak: im still holding out hope for dracthyr being other classes
[0:54:02] Ujai321: @IAmScarlett__ ye. i'm going through my DVDs rn
[0:54:16] IAmScarlett__: @Ujai321 is it like really scary
[0:54:20] JPagan2323: i swear that you only have to do broken shore and campaign to get the class mounts, thats crazy if not
[0:54:22] muffin1609: getting the suramar completion mount?
[0:54:24] cashthb: btw any good rice pudding toppings besides the usual suspects?
[0:54:30] anne42: anne42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 12 month streak! I enjoy your calming voice and casual nature
[0:54:30] Streamlabs: anne42 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:54:31] Zuldak: i remember the herding cats quest in the north west of this quest
[0:54:44] IAmScarlett__: @muffin1609 Paladin order hall mount
[0:54:57] tootodilee: i finished pally recently and didn't know about that prereq part lol
[0:55:05] Curufin_: Have you made any in-roads into doing the new profession achievements?
[0:55:10] MattFedUp: you no longer have to do broken shore per character just once on the account for class mounts
[0:55:18] GreenArrowed: yeaaa
[0:55:20] Zuldak: yes the owlcats
[0:55:29] GreenArrowed: great and frustrating quest. as it should have been.
[0:55:36] muffin1609: @IAmScarlett__ ah ok
[0:56:03] Zuldak: btw the quest all that glitter is up in the caverns. Chance at a toy and its offering gold
[0:56:09] valianya: I heard they're also adjusting the dragon riding animations for some types of mounts.  It makes sense.  It'd be weird to see a flying carpet or a mechanoshredder doing dragon wing style flying animations, right?
[0:56:17] cashthb: maybe the dog moved the chair with the conscious intent of trolling the cat
[0:56:18] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have great day.
[0:56:18] MattFedUp: cat beatbox
[0:56:25] Ujai321: "what, you got a tissue or not"
[0:56:30] juliusnord: damn I miss legion
[0:57:01] msmester1: music here FeelsGoodMan
[0:57:09] Elrathir: Hello Lightning from Final Fantasy 13 and Kira, how are you doing today?

[0:57:44] msmester1: no Kappa im waiting for legion classic never got to play it peepoSad
[0:58:06] anne42: I got the renewed magmamoth for a dream surge yesterday
[0:58:20] wisemonkey891011: You are very welcome... the future is brgiht you know... I send my love :D
[0:58:22] Terra___l: legion was the best addon
[0:58:37] Sharkeys: ugh launch legion was so rough with how legendaries were handled
[0:58:58] Darkalex175: I just wished they would have made legendaries deterministic from the beginning
[0:59:06] Zuldak: i remember loading the followers with a ton of gold accessories so even the random quests would still give like 500 gold
[0:59:19] Ujai321: so, working as intended
[0:59:46] cashthb: legion word quests had pretty good rewards, normal no longer cuts it with how easy mythics got
[0:59:51] Elrathir: best legendaries last gang!
[1:00:23] msmester1: the will fix it in legion classic just 4-5 years LUL
[1:00:28] cashthb: I call them 5 gold usually
[1:00:32] ahnn112: sephuz!!!!
[1:00:34] manoomu: sephuz?
[1:00:42] Kurama__95: Sephuz LUL
[1:00:45] JPagan2323: AGG's stride was the worst to get but fun for mog runs
[1:00:50] Zuldak: yo the neck is sick for the mage tower. 3x sockets
[1:01:03] Sharkeys: BibleThump i had sephuz first and it was so bad for me
[1:01:11] ahnn112: sephuz was SOO good for shadow
[1:01:46] Kurama__95: I just finished all the Dragonriding achievements savixCar
[1:01:50] cashthb: shadow also heals, just in reverse
[1:02:28] mayer2911: What are you hiding?
[1:03:11] Zuldak: im just happy there is a way to dump all these dragon isle supplies i dont want into ok gold
[1:03:21] russtrotter: after my MT grind in SL, when i think legion legos i just think of the socketed ones
[1:03:50] Kurama__95: @Zuldak I have a lot on my rogue and nothing to spend on atm, but when TWW pre-patch hits I can just go on a shopping spree and get EVERYTHING LUL
[1:03:50] Zuldak: @russtrotter I spent a good chunk of money crafting legendary boots because they were BIS for mage tower
[1:03:50] Kretyn: woah what is that quest journal?

[1:04:16] Kretyn: sweet ty!
[1:04:22] Zuldak: @Kurama__95 if you want to dump the DI resources, go to loam and buy barter boulders with the resources. Then sell them for gold. 25g for 100 resources
[1:04:33] msmester1: this addon should be baseline coming back and doing patches out of order is so annoying
[1:04:46] Ujai321: i like having an extra keybind for an easy keybind, but you do you
[1:04:59] Kurama__95: @Zuldak After the expansion is over and I'm sure I don't need anything else for DI, I'll dump on the boulders 100%
[1:05:24] Ujai321: but what if you need an extra action button in a dungeon, for example
[1:05:25] eielwind: my extra action button is a horrible keybind of like F8 lol
[1:05:54] adachi_akaso: did you dye your other wig or is this a different one (looks gorgeous btw)
[1:06:09] eielwind: the fyrakk seeds :D
[1:06:22] Ujai321: i know it comes up. i will try to think of when
[1:06:24] Kurama__95: I had to keybind my extra action bar back in Sanctum for Ner'zhul bombs
[1:06:26] Ghand0ur: Hazel! I need character name suggestions. I would like it to start with KG (because that is what I am known for ingame). Any suggestions?
[1:06:47] msmester1: you inspired me i will finish this on my mage FeelsGoodMan
[1:06:56] roxywilde: Kgiminy

[1:09:50] cashthb: any1 got a golden Kappa ?
[1:10:00] manoomu: my nana using twitch slang would be so funny to me
[1:10:01] heldtheline: Language is weird; considering that late 30s pregnancies can be called geriatric.
[1:10:03] erinnightz: I am 22 but for some reason I feel a little old at times
[1:10:12] Vivica_x0: I'm building an old content speed character and for some reason I'm sooo excited

[1:10:50] Daemavand: lol
[1:10:57] Zuldak: does moose have any favorite dog friends to play with?
[1:11:02] minek68: it's weird to see dragonriding on the Broken Isles, I remember doing Suramar on foot
[1:11:16] Daemavand: Has Moose been running off into the sunset with Koda?
[1:11:42] Daemavand: that is utterly magical
[1:11:55] msmester1: dragonriding made me realize how big the classic map is like it still takes time to traverse a zone
[1:12:09] cashthb: shoutout to May Dixie please
[1:12:09] Daemavand: Puppy stream cam?
[1:12:12] fadingrainbows: @heldtheline try any pregnancy in your 30s
[1:12:56] biterscat: Ooo, first time seeing you stream outside of YT <3
[1:12:57] Daemavand: lol
[1:13:12] IAmScarlett__: im so cold
[1:13:14] Daemavand: His personality makes him even bigger :D
[1:13:17] zebracak35: @msmester1 Have to remember dragon riding in classic is slower than in dragon fliht
[1:13:30] Weiyin009: /hug
[1:13:31] IAmScarlett__: @zebracak35 its not noticeable
[1:13:32] IAmScarlett__: like at all
[1:13:46] goplacidly56: lol
[1:13:50] Zuldak: if you wanted high effort you would go running with moose before stream to tire them out and then have them sleep it off durring stream
[1:14:03] manoomu: I only noticed the reduced speed when i was doing the outland races
[1:14:10] rhompa_mick: Ride a normal mount and then swap to DR ... don't notice the slower speed at all :)
[1:14:10] nyrhalahotep: yeah, that seems uncomfortable
[1:14:12] IAmScarlett__: what is a spatula
[1:14:40] Zuldak: grass to eat? is he actuaslly a moose?
[1:14:42] zebracak35: @IAmScarlett__ I'm not argueing that, the person i responded to said the contintent felt bigger because it took longer to traverse the map than they thought so I was just saying it feels that way because you're going slower
[1:15:17] anne42: I remember having to do all of this to unlock nightbourn
[1:15:41] msmester1: it was a cow all along
[1:15:45] IAmScarlett__: is moose the local grass chopping people
[1:15:49] royos__: go  back to the guy you hit
[1:15:55] IndigoCat: I used to have a fluffy white american eskimo that would eat grass and I used to tell her she's not actually a sheep. LUL
[1:16:26] Zuldak: talking to the pet is a requirement of ownership
[1:16:58] msmester1: silly moose LUL

[1:17:53] msmester1: just use thotbot
[1:18:08] bluecloud37: wowhead suggestion is to abandon or relog and try again
[1:18:17] CoffeeASAP: oh I ran into that bug before
[1:18:19] bluecloud37: the npc has a high chance of bugging
[1:18:24] krazykaffinee: Ewww a prot pally LOL!
[1:18:34] omgwatlol: I wish we could use chromie at max level + it down-level us to match the expac lvl… one-shotting everything is so BORING to me lol
[1:18:44] krazykaffinee: I like the mog
[1:18:46] Zuldak: Yay Skari
[1:18:59] IAmScarlett__: you finally got it to work hazel?
[1:19:38] DazzaDFE: First time catching the stream, thanks for all the guides, they really helped when I first started learning to raid :)
[1:19:51] eielwind: this makes me not want to do the class mount quests anymore lol
[1:19:55] IAmScarlett__: can world quests give you ancient mana
[1:20:23] Zuldak: the orderhall quest is at the bottom i think
[1:20:33] averageteacup: no Valewalker Farodin quests? i was waiting for this, i love his voice
[1:20:41] heldtheline: And you can buy ancient mana off the AH if you want
[1:21:13] heldtheline: ancient mana gems and crystals
[1:21:56] giveusgnomedruids: @hazelnuttygames was just flexing with her brontosaur 😜
[1:22:23] IAmScarlett__: can we name your brutosaur
[1:22:38] IAmScarlett__: brutus the brutosaur
[1:22:39] Elrathir: I logged in on an alt who still has the Mastery of Timeways buff still active - the exp buff from the Timewalking event that happened a long while back. Time to level 30% faster for two hours!
[1:22:58] msmester1: i was thinking if you divide the gold by 10 you kinda get wrath levels LUL
[1:23:27] hat_thebutcher: morning everyone LesbianPride mskkPeace  Ive been hopelessly addicted to Dead cells for weeks now...
[1:23:43] hat_thebutcher: It is axaxa
[1:24:23] giveusgnomedruids: Is it just me or does Hazel's hair colour change daily?
[1:24:28] hat_thebutcher: Dead Cells would make an awesome illicit substance name though. Not sure anyone would buy "Dead Cells" though
[1:24:30] d34dlyd0g: Dead Cells is a really good Rogue-like Metroidvania-esque type of game.
[1:24:59] msmester1: if you click on it in btw it marks the location on your map with tomtom
[1:25:11] thingamajigwow: BTW quests is awesome sauce
[1:25:45] hat_thebutcher: On the harder difficulties it kicks your teeth down your throat. I beat a normal run and realized that was the tutorial
[1:26:14] msmester1: on dragonflight it worked maybe they added it later idk
[1:26:50] kase1246: hello everyone
[1:26:52] d34dlyd0g: The BTWQuests flowcharts are so nice to keep track of where you are in the questline.
[1:27:10] thingamajigwow: map pin sharing thingymajig
[1:27:28] IAmScarlett__: @d34dlyd0g they are
[1:28:10] thingamajigwow: I'm too 'old' to understand WoWhead haha
[1:29:00] hat_thebutcher: best part of the class mount is getting the glyph that turns the holy pony ability into it
[1:29:16] ThisTinSoldier: There should be a word for "the feeling that someone smarter than me has worked on this problem already"
[1:29:19] hat_thebutcher: you do indeed
[1:29:40] hat_thebutcher: It's the guy on the left of the mission board
[1:29:49] msmester1: in classic they have an addon that has the wowhead link baked in for every quest LUL
[1:30:04] eielwind: at least you SEE the quest reward this time
[1:30:06] Daemavand: Tonal languages still blow my mind
[1:30:09] wowfreshman: I wanted to go back and get my class mount as a hunter. But find I have lost the artifact to continue. Cannot come with an answer to replace it.
[1:30:37] tehl00py: ok the poisons in waycrest are not nice
[1:30:54] eielwind: void storage is a thing i just...never used

[1:35:36] cashthb: that's unlucky, the subatai the swift rp got me for a while
[1:35:48] eielwind: Onyxia for me was like 2 tries
[1:36:16] Pathstrider: luckiest was mythic jailor a few weeks ago, just 20 attempts, unluckiest is still no KR after 800+
[1:36:24] manoomu: i got breezebiter the first month of DF before i realized that it had a mount to drop. that was all the luck i've had in DF
[1:36:28] jaada0: nah...love from TO
[1:37:16] ThisTinSoldier: That's the weather here. We're having a heatwave, people are saying we're getting coast winter weather. Personally, don't know what they're talking about.
[1:37:28] GreenArrowed: that's how flying into nyc can feel
[1:37:31] russtrotter: i always get confused, is lake-effect make Toronoto winter moderate and Buffalo big snow?
[1:37:56] IglooMan45: Ziggurate
[1:37:57] Darkalex175: ziggarat
[1:37:59] jmrgtrman: WHat'cha working on?
[1:38:11] jmrgtrman: Ahh kk
[1:38:29] Ozzy_ca: Buffalo get's the lake effect
[1:38:42] ThisTinSoldier: lake effect makes it wet. El Nino is making it warm. The ground is slushy and going to snap freeze the instant we have one cold day
[1:38:59] Daemavand: Humid
[1:39:01] Daemavand: so humid
[1:39:07] Darkalex175: mass of water that usually regulates temperature but can also increase the amount of precipatation
[1:39:15] evilmortyrulestheworld: adds humidity to everything
[1:39:59] ThisTinSoldier: yeah, I miss Island weather. Lived in Esquimalt for a few years. Good times
[1:40:18] Ozzy_ca: I work in Toronto -- wretched hive of scum and villainy
[1:40:20] ThisTinSoldier: I've lived on worse bases :P
[1:40:25] Ozzy_ca: I escape north whenever I can
[1:40:26] jmrgtrman: And lots a creatures hiding under the water. *Shudders
[1:40:45] Ozzy_ca: Starlink is my connection to reality -- all praise High Lord Musk
[1:40:47] jmrgtrman: When you go in the Ocean you enter the food chain. :-p
[1:41:14] russtrotter: @Ozzy_ca but the hockey hall of fame is there?? how can THAT be villanous
[1:41:31] ThisTinSoldier: @Ozzy_ca Oh, absolutely. I've lived here most of my life, and I still refuse to say I'm 'from Toronto'. Still say it with both 't's as well, lol
[1:41:40] Zuldak: so does every paladin have to do this?
[1:41:41] Ozzy_ca: I firmly believe it is being held hostage - it is our duty to liberate it
[1:41:58] shynxs101: is this the order hall Questline?
[1:42:03] Marovia: but everyone have the default artifact weapon as transmogs right?
[1:42:04] GreenArrowed: no, will be account wide
[1:42:16] russtrotter: admittedly i've just got good fond memories of Toronto.. city will always hold a special place in my heart
[1:42:24] Marovia: sadly they dont get the title..
[1:42:59] Daemavand: I think the memories associated with a particular location, city or otherwise, is what makes them feel special
[1:43:09] Daemavand: ...or basically what you just said more elegantly
[1:43:28] kynlaeh: ehh umm… nainamo
[1:43:40] Daemavand: That said, many cities/locations have a specific vibe that speaks to people
[1:43:46] Marovia: WHY ARE THEY NOT ASKING HELP TO THE PRIESTS, HOW ARE THEY SO SELF COMPETENTS
[1:43:50] Zuldak: cities also can radically change
[1:43:54] Ozzy_ca: Toronto is not druid friendly
[1:44:12] ThisTinSoldier: Yeah, but that's typical BC language. BC being the california of Canada :P
[1:44:17] Ozzy_ca: Yonge and Bloor is the worst place for pagan rituals to the nature gods
[1:44:27] kenyyHY: if you fly then it is @Ozzy_ca
[1:44:28] Ozzy_ca: BC is druid friendly
[1:44:30] Zuldak: Portland today is not portland of 2019 Sadge
[1:44:30] Daemavand: @Ozzy_ca lol! you're not wrong
[1:44:42] AlleviateWoW: Light bless you.
[1:44:45] witchhobbit: i love this cutscene lol
[1:44:55] Elrathir: simple horse making kit, just add meat
[1:44:56] eielwind: quite the fanfare
[1:44:56] ThisTinSoldier: Does it still have a different coffe shop on each corner?
[1:44:57] jmrgtrman: Ride Horsey RISE!
[1:45:15] ThisTinSoldier: Don't forget to buy the other 2 tint
[1:45:15] Marovia: so the pallys went and steal a horse while the DKs went a steal a dragon
[1:45:16] heldtheline: And the vendor you need is to your left-- the dwarf
[1:45:22] GreenArrowed: purple horsie time
[1:45:35] nyrhalahotep: and of course you're deep inside so you have to take the time to run out in order to call your mount 😂
[1:45:35] cashthb: maybe you should check out philly, san francisco or like bucharest; I'm sure it would put nainamo into a new perspective
[1:45:39] GreenArrowed: and it sparkles when it fly-gallops
[1:46:14] ThisTinSoldier: man, the class campaigns were the best questlines...
[1:46:18] shynxs101: The Red one
[1:46:25] goplacidly56: i like the darker one with blue
[1:46:25] Marovia: OG Belf horse is BiS
[1:46:26] cashthb: just stick to blanchy, you don't *have* to use it
[1:46:43] Elrathir: I always thought it was odd that there wasn't a blood elf themed highlord horse
[1:46:53] Lobain357: what addon was that? That showed the mount date and info
[1:46:56] Zuldak: so whos next? Crinkle?
[1:46:57] ThisTinSoldier: A Legendary Campaign is one of my proudest achievements. Legion was a wonderful, lonely xpack
[1:47:00] GreenArrowed: yes!
[1:47:00] jeffdmk: they do
[1:47:02] GreenArrowed: and sparkle!
[1:47:14] MattFedUp: they walk in the air
[1:47:58] GreenArrowed: its v cartoony
[1:48:06] Marovia: pattrick the ashbringer
[1:48:06] GreenArrowed: i love them tho
[1:48:07] bluecloud37: it's a bit more blocky
[1:48:08] goplacidly56: Grats, i think always worth doing that even though its a pain
[1:48:09] susicue: if I was coming back to retail after only playing a few months of Dragonflight where would I begin?
[1:48:11] bigbrockly: there are 3 other colors u can use
[1:48:19] mrspawkats: HeyGuys
[1:48:34] cashthb: palladin is ally class, no need for red!
[1:48:38] bluecloud37: I prefer the Argent Crusader mount as my pally mount choice
[1:48:48] Zuldak: the gold beetle actually fitts his mog well
[1:48:52] bluecloud37: Argent Charger*
[1:49:06] bigbrockly: u can also get a glyph for the charger sprint in the order hall
[1:49:08] Marovia: they look old but i dont want them to update them either
[1:49:15] MattFedUp: derr paladins are suposed to be alliance only
[1:49:17] ThisTinSoldier: @susicue if at 70, valdrakken for endgame updates. IF not, I would play through the standard campaign to loremaster, it's still a good experience
[1:49:24] ntdrongo: wait, did you just do the bloof elf pally mount?
[1:49:30] widdlywhee: Making us follow so we can chat. Very sneaky! Congrats on the new paladin mount. I feel the same about the red version.
[1:49:31] msmester1: he spreads so much huh
[1:49:53] nuitinsh: whats the name of the addon that shows the %?
[1:49:54] Kurama__95: Time for Boy to get his Netherlord chargers savixNodders
[1:50:21] ThisTinSoldier: DAYUM HE BEEG
[1:50:29] widdlywhee: I specifically did the paladin mount quest thingy because I wanted to start a blood elf paladin with a nifty looking mount but was a little disappointed in the end
[1:50:36] susicue: @ThisTinSoldier I have a few toons to 70. I will start there. thanks!
[1:51:10] Kurama__95: @susicue If you wanna jump into endgame, Emerald Dream campaign will get you a good headstart on gear
[1:51:16] ThisTinSoldier: honestly, you could probably do zaralek once for the lore then just skip it
[1:51:21] susicue: Ive been playing a lot of classic and SoD so everytime I log into retail I feel overwhelmed lol
[1:52:56] ThisTinSoldier: honestly, it's disorienting until you do it once. there are a LOT of floating yellow !s that can ultimately be ignored
[1:53:48] susicue: ok good to know, ty all for the advice
[1:54:43] ThisTinSoldier: no worries. doing my part to revive retail when I can :P
[1:54:48] Redinna115: Just got that mount for myself :)
[1:54:51] Daemavand: Tired
[1:54:54] Daemavand: so sleepyy
[1:55:00] eielwind: just waited 25m in a dps queue for solo shuffle and 5 games in someone left :( :( :(
[1:55:01] janahita: I love the new wig!
[1:55:04] TheBenXO: Did you get the freehold mount finally?
[1:55:22] Daemavand: I can confirm that I can currently horizontal enjoying this from my bed lol
[1:55:31] widdlywhee: Must be so liberating to use wigs.
[1:56:40] jeffdmk: mage time
[1:56:50] kenyyHY: Thanks for letting me in the guild!
[1:56:51] widdlywhee: Warlock mounts are BEYOND gorgeous, they are my favorite mounts in the entire game
[1:56:53] DrtySans: shammy
[1:56:59] MattFedUp: i did warrior back in legion and that fight is hard
[1:57:03] Quachiri: Did I miss you say rogue?
[1:57:15] ThisTinSoldier: Warlock you only get 2/3, the third is a drop i think
[1:57:18] manoomu: one of the warlock recolors is a drop from a rare mob after you get the base ones too
[1:57:28] JenTheBoss: what is this site?
[1:57:31] GreenArrowed: yea i love my lock mounts
[1:57:34] cashthb: how about working on the fyrak mythic mount?

[1:57:53] Streamlabs: danoria just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:57:56] Quachiri: I still don't have the warlock mount drop
[1:58:00] Vivica_x0: Any tips on getting pvp ilvl high enough to do solo shuffle?
[1:58:06] Pathstrider: @JenTheBoss  simple armory
[1:58:08] mrspawkats: @JenTheBoss simple armory
[1:58:13] ThisTinSoldier: @cashthb i like my blood inside my body, thx :P
[1:58:21] JenTheBoss: thank you
[1:58:30] GreenArrowed: if you don't mind random bgs, very easy way to get honor
[1:58:38] eielwind: they really need to up the penalty of people who leave solo shuffle
[1:58:54] msmester1: conquest gear also
[1:58:55] InakaUk: WI5 which is the lock drop one? I have the campaign ones but don't remember getting another
[1:59:06] msmester1: and there is some crafted gear too
[2:01:00] jkuhl58: ah yes, the only thing gnomes are good for:  being food
[2:01:30] cashthb: @eielwind they should just work on the payout, forcing people to do something they don't wanna calling for it - see league for example
[2:02:03] lemanruss30k: have you got the blood elf bandit mask for your blood elf character ?
[2:03:51] jeffdmk: It is always a good time for att random
[2:04:18] cashthb: the dh classic
[2:07:09] lilbubblegumski: youre actually pretty good for not pvping at all :P
[2:08:45] jeffdmk: I am sure it feels that way but it seems like the healer is the most important role in the outcome
[2:09:57] Axon14: no pressure on H at all.  It was just a matter of time before they got the kill.  Nice job :)
[2:09:59] cashthb: @jeffdmk yeah, that's why the first blood format smells
[2:10:04] lilbubblegumski: LOL my bad i thought u were new
[2:10:40] widdlywhee: Am I tripping or are those sounds in the game? LUL
[2:11:08] Axon14: haha it's GTFO or some other mod making those sounds
[2:12:00] one_billion_horses: gladius has been a bit wonky since last patch
[2:12:24] bluecloud37: I think freedom can be speced to give a move speed boost
[2:12:56] bluecloud37: may also be why the pally kept giving it to you
[2:13:00] wolfcloudchaser80: Someone keeps smacking Polly and then repenting.
[2:14:00] CozyHalfling: i love your shirt
[2:14:19] CozyHalfling: those are the best tshirts
[2:16:06] eielwind: meanwhile i just went 1-5 in a 1350 solo shuffle as disc *cries*
[2:17:31] eielwind: that poor other healer was only 1300 rating lol\
[2:17:38] Daemavand: Maybe by eating everything you kept them safe lol
[2:17:40] one_billion_horses: 3 away!
[2:17:42] Daemavand: LOL
[2:17:45] widdlywhee: Womp womp ;p

[2:18:16] cashthb: should have gone 6:0 instead
[2:18:36] Daemavand: bait like sharkbait
[2:18:36] lumaday: Do you turn PVP gear into tier? or do you use PVE tier pieces?
[2:18:38] Daemavand: ohaha

[2:34:38] eielwind: i've adopted ur method of having a blank chat box as a healer -_-
[2:34:51] cashthb: woah the new night fae stomp thingy looks horrible compared to the original

[2:39:45] abhorrentascendance: The hunter necrolord ability looks so much better since the update
[2:39:48] Zuldak: so just  a heads up  the warlock one has a twist, you can get the base mount normally but the off color is a rare spawn on the broken shore
[2:40:16] Zinnjo: did you know you can remove the last 2 out of 5 toons in the Gladius frames? just if you wonna only show 3 instead of 4

[2:55:45] Ryok: according to google the longest arena match was 13 and a half hours it ended being between a warlock and a resto druid but they weren't going full force the whole time because at points the WL went afk to make brownies and would come back in time to drain life back to full hp
[2:56:18] Ragnaratos: u still ahd tranq left ^^
[2:56:25] Ryok: in the end the WL won because he was able to get a drain life to keep channeling through a pillar
