[2:43:19] SeanSotir23: a better version of classic
[2:43:27] RatDevil: Eaving folks
[2:43:37] pac1776_: big hype for fresh
[2:43:44] luchion09: why hahah
[2:43:47] SeanSotir23: mainly solving issues that classic had like world buffs and raid balancing
[2:43:49] DrizzTV: new level 60 servers will open with a 12 month timer, with WB nerfs, new raid boss mechanics, no mage AoE boosting, etc
[2:43:50] lillwicher: but you can play classic now? so why the fresh\
[2:43:51] akkatest: but can't u already play classic ? lol i thought classic and tbc are separate servers
[2:43:52] nemisback: rebooting a rebooted game, sounds like inception
[2:44:20] Cowardpatty: WoW Classic Fresh is Blizzard's attempt to appeal to the vanilla community that played on Private Servers where they would periodically reset the server.  It will also have some tweaks for some issues that played Classic the 1st time.
[2:44:25] SeanSotir23: well there will be like 4 games ( classic, tbc, classic fresh and retail)
[2:44:33] thedazwoo: You done with new world swifty?

[2:56:02] Synthica86: no its not
[2:56:03] akkatest: why does ppl care about games dying lol, people just play for the only purpose of playing something new anyway
[2:56:04] kinkyspatula: @Slayer_Eagleone I think the bugs, glitches and cheating has given the devs an insane incline.
[2:56:10] Synthica86: maybe borken atm but not dead
[2:56:11] zittla: i wouldent say its dying but ppl are abusing invincebility glitches so they cant die

[3:36:22] jiincs: @Cowardpatty ban evaders
[3:36:32] lunatik710: sounds like someone who got banned made a new account and is trying to get back in

[3:37:09] Cowardpatty: Hmmm, let me advise them to contact Twitch
[3:37:18] jiincs: where did you find your 2s partner
[3:37:42] Galdrena: they will probably have to make a new email address and change the email associated with their account
[3:38:00] jiincs: @Cowardpatty no need patty they're simply just banned on here lol
[3:38:00] Galdrena: if it's the person CowardPatty asked me about earlier he's not banned
[3:38:04] Jigslol_: Track has been in touch with swifty in the past months, I think since BFA or so
[3:38:09] jiincs: trying to evade the ban by using a different twitch account
[3:38:29] jiincs: @Galdrena but the message patty sent means they were banned on a different account
[3:38:42] jiincs: I've seen it on other streamer's channels
[3:39:36] rjaDash: @Galdrena if you know their username try this as a mod /user [username] its supposed to tell you if they banned
[3:39:43] Xaviwan078: "...to crush your enemies,  see them driven before you!
[3:39:56] Galdrena: i did do that @rjaDash they aren't banned
[3:40:15] JustMipe: I'm glad to see how papa swifty smiles while playing
[3:40:47] jiincs: that's because they most likely didn't give you the actual username of the account they were actually banned on initially
[3:40:50] mthgold: are you using that conduit that makes your rallying cry super big?
[3:40:53] jiincs: gald

[3:42:24] Jigslol_: Daily quests now give you more research points that before :) So you will be rank 6 in less time!
[3:42:44] mthgold: the one that you feed corpses for it to spawn? @SmoothGeorge1
[3:43:00] emonty93: Logged into the retail to check out new stuff.. bored in 10 minutes
[3:44:15] rjaDash: @Galdrena "In a recent update to help prevent ban evasion, if one phone or email verified account is suspended site-wide, all accounts tied to that phone or email will also be suspended site-wide."
[3:44:18] mthgold: I got rank 3 in 1 week and a half and I barely farmed
[3:44:23] Jigslol_: YES
[3:44:26] SmoothGeorge1: @Mthgold no Observer Yorik in Rift.
[3:44:31] makazz98: yes :)
[3:44:32] Skazin: Have you ever tried to grow a majestic beard swifty?
[3:44:41] Jigslol_: Yes, you need Research points to buy them
[3:44:51] Jigslol_: For alll vendor options
[3:45:01] Galdrena: yeah @rjaDash i seen that. That's probably what happened. Someone could've used his email address to make an alt account that got banned.
[3:45:07] Jigslol_: Sockets or Conduits
[3:45:16] wrenshultz01: advertKek
[3:45:30] Jigslol_: Just 1 character needs to be rank6 and alts would just need buy points
[3:46:07] rjaDash: @Galdrena yea
[3:46:10] Jigslol_: keepgrinding korthia with the highest rank character

[3:48:02] dalle1: yoo swifty how wow pvp rn? monk still busted?
[3:48:04] wrenshultz01: 18 months, this is our second twitch baby swifty nohitjPeepers
[3:48:28] Cowardpatty: 20 items levels higher than my gear lol
[3:48:53] Jigslol_: Also Choreghast if you do a Flawless 200 points run, you can have chance to drop a 252 conduits *Note if you have conduits 226 the next rank would be 239 and from 239 would level up to 252.... so may be a lilttle bit frustrating but, 2 wings per week, a 20min run per wing is easy :D
[3:49:00] nixxiheals: I played until Duelist in S1, I quit right after cause I found the PvP very unbalanced. Is this still the case? Doubting if I should play new season in retail or play SoM
[3:49:51] mthgold: imo just get your main conduits to a respectable level, then ditch upgrading them LUL too much grinding
[3:50:22] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
