[3:26:10] realgrym: hey swifty. I know you probably won't read this but I've played WoW since BC, I'm very avoidant and a lot of my time is spent on my computer including doing graphic design. a few days ago, my laptop died and I do not have any sort of money to fix it. I really feel disconnected without a computer if there's any way you can just help me fix it please I'm sorry

[3:30:02] Cowardpatty: @realgrym  I'm not trying to sound insensitive, but there are better places to ask for technical advice on determining what is wrong with the laptop.  There needs to be some back and forth dialogue to try to narrow down what the issue may be. It could range from dead battery, to dead CPU, to failed HDD/SSD.  Have you tried in tech forums?
[3:30:07] realgrym: swifty it's fine man really :) I just have nobody to ask so I figured I'd ask here. just got a broken fan and I don't even think they still make the replacement part
