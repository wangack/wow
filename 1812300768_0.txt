[3:57:54] Voodoodippin: I need that for my brain lol
[3:57:55] tatboy69: turn off core isolation for maximum performance
[3:58:07] nativefig: That 0.3ms is the "response time" which is not the same as the input latency
[3:58:08] lexthestoic: turn graphics to ultraa
[3:58:10] headgrumble: I feel like that's overkill, especially for MMO
[3:58:14] sgten1987: what fps are you getting?
[3:58:23] Preacher290461: I know some people use em, but it's a cheap work around
