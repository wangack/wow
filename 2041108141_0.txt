[1:28:35] Anckael: Why can I see this group struggling on normal ICC even with the buff? üò≠
[1:28:36] Chodie: Perma = you can appeal in 30 days. Terminated = no chance for appeal.

[1:29:10] DuckSmoke_: Pretty sure you guys only got banned because the guys you robbed were well connected and crying about it. You were RPing as fucking criminals, it only makes sense a robbery turns to murder when someone gets ID'd.

[1:38:13] jazzmaggot: I think it proves that you arent the leader of Scam Squad LUL
[1:38:13] Grim08a: One of the main reasons Juggs is hated so much on Reddit is because he is a smaller streamer and interacting with bigger streamer the reddit trash consider to be clout chasing.
[1:38:14] VioIe: guilty by association
[1:38:15] xenshea: gross classic gameplay
