[1:30:43] Unstabledh: im surprised then they timed 29 vp with fury warrior PogChamp
[1:30:48] helafix696: ECHO  IS GREAT
[1:31:11] Goliathse: If you dont have anything positive to say, i think its best to just not write imo, this comp whining gets you nowhere
[1:31:15] heytememore: Hey blizzard gj doing a game with 30 specs and in tournaments always play the same even in pvp and pve
[1:31:18] DmanDaz: Its great to know that when i queue for a key i have absolutely no chance of getting invited unless im one of these 5 classes..
[1:31:21] Ricksn_starwolf: unstable is giga lucker
[1:31:23] ffcipher: nothing special about echo. just find 4 other ppl u can game with 16 hrs a day for 10 years and u can play at their level
[1:31:31] BobDaUnicorn: that's 30 seconds wasted right there

[1:32:05] Tata213: I dont think this event really showcases Dragonflight if its only the same 5 classes doing PvE content. Huge misplay by blizz not addressing this while going thru with the event

[1:32:58] Rohaana: @Tata213 What do you mean? If other classes were better they would just play them instead. Why would you not play the best setup when you are playing to win?

[1:34:01] Moai: @blktoothgrin the problem is that having classes so strong make it difficult for every other class to do even lower kays, people dont want to risk their keys and will only want to invite exodia comps
[1:34:02] moderatygos: i don't think they ever had 140 points

[1:36:02] EzzLyfe: GG na
[1:36:06] methoduzz: Its an MMO. There will ALWAYS be a META. I don't care what game you play. When you play to time the highest keys, not every class will be taken. You can still get M+ title with ANY class. Just quit pugging and get a group and hop in disc.
[1:36:13] Ladiplace: gg
[1:36:15] Ultratoasted: @rasmusadrian22 ok

[1:36:43] ffcipher: Anyone can be as good as these players, just press your buttons in the right order at the right time and dodge all avoidable dmg... pff
[1:37:01] EzzLyfe: undr 30 rq?
[1:37:06] Finaren_: Here you just play what is best like BFA TRIPLE BM hunter was so much worse
[1:37:07] Tripsterx: @finaren55 the correct answer is ppl cant reroll to any spec at any time and perform at the highest level due to difficulty
[1:37:09] Dejw9: Whats mean that WR ?

[2:10:57] Sonikbob: @Tata213 It depends. Do you wanna do keys that are 27+, then yeah these are close to the only classes, If you wanna chill around the +20 level, everything is viable
[2:10:59] Finaren_: Tbf having one negative and one positive affix would be so cool They could have harder negative affixes while positive affixes would make The keys more fun
[2:11:01] Fallenarch11: if they will give S1 key for last key it will be nokud since we saw the other 3 in groups
[2:11:05] beardedbroo: Game is in beta mode so can only play those classes for now xD

[2:28:27] ozantus: if its 3 phasable on 30 its doable i guess
[2:28:29] beeweev: Question for production, what’s stopping us from seeing boss health on the percentage bar? Maybe also for mini bosses because on fortified runs it’s such a pain point. Is that possible?

[2:32:50] jelliman_92: can be done with 0 death run
[2:32:51] capitainemort: @Warcraft  it is .. they head 3 deaths
[2:32:54] Unstobubble_: Void torrent get cancelled by volcanic that might be the reason
[2:32:55] tempestyn: deaths dont matter
[2:32:55] B3nbu: the deaths didn't matter kek
[2:32:55] oKubus: Deaths didnt matter. They didnt kill the boss in tiem
[2:32:55] Taylor131313: deaths ultimately didn't matter since the boss phased
[2:32:59] itsmegeforce: deaths doesnt matter on that if they have to play another intemrission
[2:33:00] QueentasticTDP: Yes they did it before. Before mage, priest, bear and Aug nerfs
[2:33:03] quarkoffel: @beeweev The deaths didn't matter. They got another phase, which 15 seconds wouldn't solve
[2:33:04] Thomas_Huayra: @Ladiplace the deaths didn't matter, since the boss phase was itr
[2:33:04] SMOrc0: Without 3 deaths still phasing
[2:33:05] destrostoo: XD death=lose of damage good chat
[2:33:06] b4zo0: 3 deaths don't change an entire intermission phase, it was jsut missing dmg
[2:33:06] SakhetEU: The deaths didn’t matter, they need to skip that extra intermission
[2:33:09] g0gool: how boring, im gonna play pvp
[2:33:09] unholyhoit: deaths aren't more than yet another intermission
[2:33:13] BobDaUnicorn: clickz was too late with the rescue on meeres and his cast stopped due to volcanic
[2:33:20] manelkrystall: deaths wasnt the problem since  intermission again..
[2:33:30] Ladiplace: true that tbh - true that
[2:33:30] fallopianoob: NA's 3 seconds off echo atm? LOL
[2:33:31] jedimind_lbc: @Thomas_Huayra yep youre right.. they need to find that 2 percent in that last phase
[2:33:34] Finaren_: Like I dont think less deaths get you longer Phase
[2:33:36] zacaries_: @ginttoki it wasnt below 1% but you Echo fan bois dont like facts
[2:33:37] daniel85mg: EU Last DAy KEKW
[2:33:42] SMOrc0: Wasted 1h
[2:33:46] beeweev: True you right
[2:33:49] jedimind_lbc: @BobDaUnicorn there's the 2 precent!
[2:34:01] atrame: They still can't do the 30 actually, the boss phase takes longer than the 15 second death differential. It's not possible unless they min max literally everything
[2:34:02] fh_azrael: if clickz got volcaniced thats 100% the missing %
[2:34:04] marcofellipe69: StillWaiting
[2:34:08] zacaries_: @Goliathse it was 3%

[2:34:23] EzzLyfe: @SMOrc0 at this stage of the race it's not a waste since all teams have a low chance to time anything

[2:35:33] Sebleh: @ElderPhobos they were 2% off as the timer expired and got an intermission on the last boss
[2:35:35] Finaren_: They just need squeeze more boss dmg on last boss thats it  it wont help them to get there 30s faster bcs the intermission takes like a minute

[2:41:15] Bloodbottler_88: The team that pulls Fishface today, get's a golden pass to the final tomorrow. Sounds like a solid deal.
[2:41:16] Vaeny: @beeweev He probably isnt super knowledgable about high m+ but he's a good colour caster so more there to facilitate discussions and fill voids, quite standard in casts
[2:41:22] Zeneri: WHERE IS ECHO

[2:42:07] tettles: @snse Okay so I definitely eat more Chocolate Chip Cookies than Brownies, but I think I like good brownies more. I think it has to be the cookies
[2:42:16] Sebleh: When does echo play?
[2:42:27] lesley2280: Echo also had 15 sec on the death timer a clean run would have been enough

[3:34:50] trainenjoyr: Dr Jay's group found this btw, Echo just coppied it
[3:34:51] LGhost: I think Echos plan was to get ahead with the 30 Halls and save the 31 FH for last day. I think it may come down to the 31 FH and other teams might want to work on it

[3:35:44] Bloodbottler_88: Mathnos knows all the tactics.
[3:35:44] SaulGoodman_: WAYTOODANK
[3:35:48] B3nbu: Echo exploiting Chatting
[3:35:48] dumpsterfire3: The current casters have charisma, logical and focused. They don't ramble, low charisma and clearly thirsty for attention.
[3:35:52] ppq45: havent played in like 8 years, but ill be rebuilding on mal'ganis horde
[3:35:57] Thomas_Huayra: Plague Warscourge Borers

[3:36:14] lockdown_sypher1: @dumpsterfire3 i have been telling that long time
[3:36:15] Ali1331: Mr Mathnos could you explain how reducing CD time means fewer totems again
[3:36:23] unholyhoit: huh
[3:36:27] SylvaticSky1755: why did echo quit????
[3:36:27] nervio2701: Ultra tech
[3:36:28] BobDaUnicorn: @derixx_8604 echo ''wasted'' an hour on their 30 HoI attempt
[3:36:29] Andychron: @derixx_8604 tiebreaker of 30 vs 29
[3:36:31] Time_Eclipse: 30 FH
[3:36:35] SMOrc0: If you pull warscourge on last boss, it gives the boss CDR which results in only 1 totem spawning at a time
[3:36:37] moderatygos: @Ali1331 it casts the other spell more frequently
[3:36:37] mazllli: did gingi sheep that mob? KEKW

[3:36:51] RazvanCC88: @Ali1331 the  cooldown for another ability that is not totem comes back first, so that ability replaces the totem cast apparently
[3:36:55] OmzoGG: Echo testing something?
[3:36:55] Miinime: plink
[3:36:57] cthulhusquid7: it means more breaths, hence less totems inbetween
[3:36:59] Fatassfrodo: 31 more possible with 1 totem per phase
[3:37:00] Hugejorma: plonk
[3:37:01] elve94: missed a cage
[3:37:03] XAAM: plonk
[3:37:03] cheeky88: im not a pessimist, im an optometrist
[3:37:06] quarkoffel: @Chr0nicConsumer Echo uses a buff of a mob to force the last Boss to spawn tokens less often since it can cast another spell more often
[3:37:08] DaBo00: @Goliathse Perplexed has two 30's vs Echo's one, so Perplexed is ahead on tie-breaker
[3:37:09] Ali1331: @moderatygos ohhh the boss prefers to cast the other spell over totem

[3:37:30] Meeix: see bottom right
[3:37:34] SylvaticSky1755: but whyyyyy! :D
[3:37:36] derixx_8604: Echo was what? 2 points ahead at the end of yesterdays round? And now even but behind with tiebreaker
[3:37:47] sendhelp111: NA last hope eliminated?
[3:37:49] SlayinSilver: @Bloodbottler_88 you can swim below the barrier and get out earlier that way

[3:51:10] OmzoGG: I think Echo could get a 30 FH completed in 25:30 so doing the 31 for them should be timeable

[3:53:09] Vaeny: natural dodge can make him not eat
[3:53:10] EzzLyfe: could they dominate a lasher idk?
[3:53:10] thepanoramiks: @shimmeewuh That will always be an issue but if u are not doing 25+ u dont care for meta
[3:53:15] synariel: Hunter needs rework to be useful in m+ in the foreseeable future unless they get absolutely broken dps buffs
[3:53:15] moderatygos: he's just not hungry
[3:53:20] SycNasty: BUFF DH
[3:53:23] goonerboi21: you can port out with aug and sometimes he dont eat

[3:53:36] batochad: How much more time do they have?
[3:53:45] viniciusmx123: what does 'wr' mean?
[3:53:46] shimmeewuh: @shimmeewuh imagine getting declined to a +17 with 2.8k io because you arent a fire mage or aug
[3:53:47] Shearin77: maybe he's full
[3:53:48] nozonemazalaza: @thepanoramiks COPIUM

[3:54:54] thepanoramiks: @shimmeewuh Gitgud
[3:54:55] Fluffin04: @rikskrim agreed
[3:54:58] Hugejorma: Maybe plonk
[3:55:03] kzeking: world of five classes craftLOL
[3:55:11] shimmeewuh: @cocorott I don't think its bad to talk about the meta, but meta has bled into the lower keys because people dont run brains
[3:55:15] glimmerywind: @Sleepypan LUL
[3:55:15] UpadlySzczurr: @Deckluhm he just dont know how to press buttons Kappa
[3:55:16] runnesvoid: @Deckluhm they are worse players obvs
[3:55:19] blue2161: @Deckluhm It's a support spec that's boosting the other player's stats
[3:55:20] Emiliability: @kzeking good one ResidentSleeper
[3:55:23] stimpius: What do the casters think the theoretical highest key could be on TGP? Neltharus?
[3:55:31] CubeTTV_: @Deckluhm it is essentially a buff bot, the mage and priest are doing more damage because the evoker is there
[3:55:34] Swybe: Echo 2 minutes ahead of NA's Last Hope on timer, but way further in the dungeon
[3:55:47] goonerboi21: bad rng for echo
[3:55:49] lurkbelow82: this skip waiting so annoying
[3:55:53] Deckluhm: @blue2161 ok that's what I thought, that's broken :D
[3:55:58] spotteddoggo: ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT ECHO BREAKING RULES?
[3:55:59] Fluffin04: @Swybe same trash atm though
[3:56:01] huo_junzhang: why is echo bugging last boss of bracken?
[3:56:02] honeyhoney44: echo r cheating

[3:56:20] thepanoramiks: @honeyhoney44 wipe your tears
[3:56:22] freeederikke: echo is not cheating - everything has to get approved.
[3:56:24] natsukur0: huo_junzhang average yumy viewer or ?
[3:56:26] spotteddoggo: ECHO IS FREE TO BREAK RULES?????
[3:56:29] gardielos: they are just 5heads

[3:57:20] Magruun: NA Sadge
[3:57:23] blinkeys: @freeederikke i do think the echo is cheat. The gingi is always uise combuistion,. but the COmbustion is 2 minute Cdown, so it should be able to use every 30 second
[3:57:23] Meeix: Admins approved Echos tech beforehand chat. Chill out
[3:57:28] Creaxie: Echo is playing the game Waaah BabyRage
[3:57:34] Kieron_RS: when I die it's because the game is bs and it's not my fault Madge
[3:57:38] ZappCatt: Na wipes and not a word
[3:57:42] art_CH: Healer issue 100%
[3:57:44] lurkbelow82: NA o7
[3:57:46] huo_junzhang: @Meeix if any other team asked for that "technique" would it have go approve? pretty sure notr
[3:57:47] miraclewhipd: Tech is what makes this so interesting
[3:57:48] ZappCatt: get off echos jock
[3:58:02] honeyhoney44: @Meeix we can still think its dumb it got approved
[3:58:04] Vaeny: @huo_junzhang alright mr tinfoil hat
[3:58:05] SMOrc0: NA last hope gave up on 30 BH?
[3:58:06] bluemagic212121: @don3dward bug you say? Kreygasm
[3:58:08] lilieth: @huo_junzhang every team has fair grounds. If they come up with it and can do it. they would
[3:58:09] synariel: @huo_junzhang Exactly, this^^^^ try doing that as any other team, i'd love to see it lmao
[3:58:09] L0mashu: healer fault
[3:58:11] cheeky88: @miraclewhipd agreed
[3:58:11] freeederikke: @blinkeys learn to play mage, before you speak about it. :)
[3:58:13] Meeix: @huo_junzhang of course it wouldve.
[3:58:17] Fatassfrodo: Yup bites are brutal and huge mortal strike
[3:58:17] Marskore: @huo_junzhang The strat is approved for all.
[3:58:18] ARROOCE: @huo_junzhang how would you know lmao
[3:58:23] UpadlySzczurr: EU>NA proved
[3:58:26] parano2: what slime did they pull? I dont see anything on MDT

[3:59:15] TCGRebel: @the_allmighty_oz welcome to meta specs
[3:59:17] Sarinilol: it's two shot, they resetted it earlier

[3:59:29] SycNasty: BUFF DH
[3:59:29] EzzLyfe: any chance they 2 chest it?
[3:59:30] nozonemazalaza: @LordMaydell flyhacks
[3:59:33] bearfukuu: Yep love the ECHO haters, great to see them dominate these NA noobs
[3:59:35] cheeky88: they shouldve saved the last boss tech for tomorrow though, now everyone else is gonna try
[3:59:37] B3nbu: @vaeny naowhHey
[3:59:49] DaBo00: @LordMaydell giving the boss a cooldown reduction so that he spawns fewer totems because he prios casting
[3:59:51] Vaeny: @B3nbu HeyGuys
[3:59:56] shimmeewuh: I vote for mandatory chat breaks during each broadcast. But don't call it a mute or a ban, know what i mean?

[4:00:00] Shearin77: @LordMaydell anything echo does upsets ppl
[4:00:02] sendludezxdd: o7
[4:00:03] Fluffin04: @huo_junzhang what's questionable?
[4:00:05] brotan123: I think its goodbye legendary they are hard trolling all day
[4:00:06] Thedragonsenpai: o7
[4:00:06] xLernex: 07
[4:00:06] synariel: @cheeky88 True but I'm sure it takes practice, which Echo will have done plenty of prior
[4:00:25] shimmeewuh: That way viewers gotta do the same thing players do, really immersive experience
[4:00:26] cheeky88: good point
[4:00:31] Meeix: @LordMaydell Echo takes Warscourges into the boss, their "pack tactics" apply to boss as well. This reduces the Choking Rotcloud CD and gives them less totems bc of spellqueueing
[4:00:32] bearfukuu: NA KEKW
[4:00:34] Kokozko: @huo_junzhang Your tears are so tasty. Keep it up my guy
[4:00:48] Sebleh: Sounds unbairable
[4:00:48] stimpius: Do they have enough damage for the totems in a +31 do you think?
[4:00:57] TCGRebel: cmon dorki tcgrebClap
[4:00:58] MartyrTV1: barebacking in valdrakken
[4:00:59] Thomas_Huayra: did he just say "bear back in valdrakken"

[4:01:30] Supcore: make wow f2p
[4:01:32] zannq: dorki is choking :(
[4:01:33] Meeix: @huo_junzhang yes, it seems perfectly fine to me - any other team can do the same
[4:01:33] goonerboi21: A triumphant roar echoes from atop the Seat of the Aspects as Nasz’uro, the Unbound Legacy is formed.
[4:01:37] brotan123: the observer didn't even realize what happened why show that KEKW
[4:01:48] moderatygos: fishface!
[4:01:49] Holysal: @huo_junzhang not against the rules since admin approved. I would leave it alone
[4:01:50] lilieth: I take credit for Echo using the dome tech <3
[4:01:56] Arcaddia_: EU always using weird tactics
[4:01:58] miraclewhipd: HSWP
[4:02:01] Fatassfrodo: So druid swims to fishface and stones back to the evoker

[4:02:04] synariel: I am not saying it's not clever. In fact, it's kind of insanely 5d. But if another team had tried it? idk man.......

[4:02:27] nozonemazalaza: Cheating PogO ?
[4:02:31] cheeky88: it can vote
[4:02:42] Supcore: getting worse with every patch
[4:02:44] fearcxnt: @huo_junzhang dude... please stop crying
[4:02:48] Marskore: If it's approved for one, it's approved for all. So all the crying about Echo preference makes no sense to me.
[4:02:51] moderatygos: @huo_junzhang how do you know its getting fixed? has anybody said that? the admins approved the strat
[4:02:53] bluemagic212121: Ban huo junz

[4:05:58] Dorll: They're just adding death time to give the others a chance
[4:06:09] shimmeewuh: @synariel There is literally no source this is happening
[4:06:20] kingtom34: they had first two totems at +28 too
[4:06:22] Holysal: @moderatygos all it does is makes the tgp less exciting
[4:06:27] lylah_official: @synariel wouldnt be the first, wasnt plaguebearers allowed aswell and got fixed right after?
[4:06:31] moderatygos: correct, there isn't any word about a hotfix
[4:06:33] HotDadWithNoKids: @synariel everyone has access so it can be bs but its bs for everyone
[4:06:41] Marskore: Can we full screen Echo?
[4:06:42] Swybe: @moderatygos lmao how, every team can do it
[4:06:42] goonerboi21: insane tech, these guys mustve spent so long cooking this up, so impressive tbh
[4:06:45] Fatassfrodo: guess I need to learn a new bh strat now
[4:06:48] synariel: @shimmeewuh Hence why I used the word 'if', are you familiar with its meaning?
[4:06:49] Sintry123: This is some absolutely crazy tech holy heck
[4:06:49] anarkii: please full  screen echo..
[4:06:49] moderatygos: @lylah_official to my knowledge, the plagueborers was not something pre-approved by the admin team
[4:06:49] Importaint: watching any wow event = walking on eggshells lmao u can say more in primary school
[4:06:50] fashion_derg: what was the tactic
[4:06:57] cocothepirate: @lylah_official they did not adequately explain to the admins their plan for plagueborers
[4:06:59] nozonemazalaza: @fashion_derg flyhacks
[4:07:01] orcahontas: this is so 5Head
[4:07:02] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/TGPS2Finals
[4:07:09] moderatygos: the teams being required to get approval for strats is a newer part of this tournament
[4:07:11] Aspergg: why would they hotfix this? It's not like it'll change anything to 90% of chat doint their weekly +13 lol
[4:07:15] Arkshol: iirc naowh said they asked
[4:07:18] Dorll: @jbuck0504 just because it ain't your cup of tea doesn't mean it ain't ours
[4:07:19] tannerexuberant: Says the one watching it LOL
[4:07:20] Kieron_RS: Also be aware they weren't even the fastest 28 BH using that, so what's the problem...
[4:07:23] palonskan: give us echo
[4:07:28] tiny_tiger__: just tuned in, can someone fill me in on what this argument about regarding strats?
[4:07:32] lylah_official: @moderatygos wait so how were they allowed to use that? LUL
[4:07:38] brotan123: don't worry chat the reason you are not timing 30 is not that you didn't know the strat
[4:07:38] miraclewhipd: Just perma the chat baiters ResidentSleeper
[4:07:41] moderatygos: @lylah_official which?
[4:08:01] lylah_official: @moderatygos the plaguebearer strat
[4:08:05] damnation93: Echo making 99.999999% of all players look small brain when it comes to dungeons
[4:08:11] SamuelHydenstein: @miraclewhipd simmer down
[4:08:13] Taylor131313: can someone explain to me how echo's strat works? I didn't get it
[4:08:15] cheeky88: its borderline 6head strat tbh
[4:08:15] moth43: How does it work again?
[4:08:17] Dorll: @jbuck0504 ??? I finished my work shift and am relaxing now, thanks for hate watching though and supporting the stream.
[4:08:20] Importaint: @brotan123 that literally has nothing to do with anything said in chat lmao
[4:08:22] HJM_hs: Meeres skilled player but that is not normally, This very very insane....They need to check him pc and game
[4:08:23] Iamready50: @damnation93 indeed
[4:08:23] ImNecessaryEvil: OWL2019200iq
[4:08:25] SamuelHydenstein: echo is exploiting i got a feeling about it
[4:08:27] miraclewhipd: @samuelhydenstein GOOD SHOW
[4:08:32] fearcxnt: people complaining of TGP being boring because of the same comps and strats. someone comes out with a feckin new 5Head Strat and people complain about that. Doesn't matter what you do, people will complain
[4:08:33] cjayen: exploiting KEKW
[4:08:33] Hugejorma: plink
[4:08:34] moderatygos: @lylah_official i'm not 100% sure, but i think they found the strat and did not share it because they weren't required to get approval at the time, so that would be a different scenario than this time. now they have to get approval for special tech
[4:08:35] Swybe: this is literally just clever use of game mechanics
[4:08:38] anarkii: Its Clever use of game mechanics.
[4:08:44] Iamready50: @samuelhydenstein no? It was approved
[4:08:48] art_CH: Sometimes i feel like chat is literally 12yold crying about everything
[4:08:49] bearfukuu: Meeres skilled player but that is not normally, This very very insane....They need to check him pc and game
[4:08:50] tiny_tiger__: what did they do?
[4:08:52] lockdown_sypher1: AND THats why ECHO IS NUMBER !

[4:09:32] Aspergg: It's the same getting the buff from the mob in Black Rook Hold a few years ago...
[4:09:33] SmootTM: number ! chat letsgo

[4:09:40] lylah_official: @moderatygos are the ones doing these approvals are like actual r1 pushing player or something like that  or just your avg player?
[4:09:41] Drena: BUFF HAVOC DH @Warcraft

[4:09:49] BobDaUnicorn: 100% doable 31
[4:09:52] shimmeewuh: I'm still not seeing the point of complaining about the strat, that's a pretty big brain thing to do, takes practice, effort, an min-maxxing the details of the dungeon, which is what you expect of this competition.
[4:09:53] Sintry123: @Meeix You are number ?
[4:09:53] goonerboi21: echo got this wrapped up tbh
[4:09:54] Saucy_Jake: I am number !

[4:10:00] ppq45: these 2 casters together are fire
[4:10:00] moderatygos: @lylah_official the approvals are the admin team which are the people who run this tournament
[4:10:01] Iamready50: @1zzet its embarassing, that 1 dude was Almost crying
[4:10:03] jenkins: ggs!
[4:10:03] synariel: TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT ONCE, CHAT, DO YOU KNOW WHAT NUANCE MEANS LMAO
[4:10:14] Holysal: no reason to watch tomorrow. echo wins the tgp

[4:11:09] thepanoramiks: Just go FH 30 and Halls 30 after
[4:11:09] 1zzet: @piskeris10 you mean someone who starts on"g"? :D
[4:11:11] Holysal: @lylah_official and the approval made that difficult irrelevant. boring to watch tbh
[4:11:13] Bizentein: plink
[4:11:17] PhysicsHaiku: Is there any chance Echo have some insane tech for a FH31 and don't want to show it until tomorrow?

[4:12:05] risam_1742: plink

[4:49:08] PhysicsHaiku: @Meeix I have a super super important question: Do you know where you can get Yarrgi's staff transmog by any chance?
[4:49:09] LotteC: @doomsage om the yellow arrow top left, hover mouse
[4:49:19] LGhost: I want to see if NA gets that pull in vp
[4:49:20] Ximevieweracc: @Marskore ye
[4:49:21] Jokonn: believe it or not comps are changing next session it's actually just 3 unholy dks and a mistweaver monk

[4:49:55] SerThunderbeans: almost said "back heavy" but changed his mind LUL
[4:49:59] EzzLyfe: or was it a visual bug
[4:50:04] Marskore: So it's mostly just cleaning up the run for Echo here.
[4:50:14] Ximevieweracc: in 1-2 weeks blizz will increase VP timer watch it
[4:50:17] Meeix: someone asked about this before, i think its one of those things that are only implemented on TNMT (yet) - theres no data on how to get it on live, allthough someone claimed its a random drop in a pandaria area before iirc
[4:50:25] Meeix: @PhysicsHaiku
[4:50:26] Melderke: Yes echo barely timed 29, but watch this run, no deaths and 3min left after last boss, and noone will ask a question, even casters, ohh its just echo
[4:50:40] EzzLyfe: someone asked about this before, i think its one of those things that are only implemented on TNMT (yet) - theres no data on how to get it on live, allthough someone claimed its a random drop in a pandaria area before iirc

[4:51:02] LGhost: which 3 are streaming?
[4:51:10] Emiliability: @Meeix i think that was a miscommunication, the butterfly net that is a real drop is a different item, the transmog appearance has no known source iirc
[4:51:17] Whitewolf1441: assuming jdotb
[4:51:27] lurkbelow82: yikes

[5:40:04] Temperaturka: @sunaruqtx I understand that Raze does all the work, but "frantic recovery" And absorb are no less good, and I'm sure when you press burst you don't notice how you press it(frantic recovery)
[5:40:18] Heregellas: @Bloodbottler_88 More like Lepoêle
[5:40:32] LGhost: NA or Perplexed gotta come in and get VP within the first hour I think or it will just be too much to catch up to Echo

[5:43:11] seteleechete: echo and perplexed did 22:32 and they are 32:14 so it's doable

[5:44:04] seteleechete: 32:14 is good enough for time diff they need 33:18
[5:44:04] GospelPower: !leaderboard
[5:44:04] Kantera_: @seteleechete but they need to beat last minutes time cuz it would be a tiebreaker thats why they are stressing the time
