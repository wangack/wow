[0:26:31] ployboi69: Error
[0:26:33] Hym1R: I member when piety was the final boss and you has to do first 3 acts 3 times
[0:26:35] OniScythe: D2 bis

[0:26:52] JaeusA: Launch D3 sucked but Reaper of Souls and its additions+changes were VERY solid
[0:26:56] Syrjyys: Same, was a free game for me
[0:27:01] Larmenius: Last Epoch is great, would be cool if you gave it a playthrough  in one of their future seasons
[0:27:02] KelticNight: the Real Money Auction House was a vibe
[0:27:02] never2manysocks: Its so tragic. D2 got me into Blizzard games and eventually wow. D3 was exciting until I played it..
[0:27:03] Saint473: @Lctl10 that was tyriel's horse, 6 months was the game.
[0:27:07] OniScythe: Sadge
[0:27:07] Syrjyys: a bit?

[0:27:29] GoobleGamingTV: A company for the players and not the shareholders
[0:27:43] GeordieMarauder: that’s how you could originally get the Tyrael mount
[0:27:47] grumpy_dan: they are still all connected ... through the colon of blizzard
[0:27:49] yuiona: ?
