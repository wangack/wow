[1:55:28] Miksch: terrible

[1:56:01] Bikuchu: wait what's Lone Wolf other than the server?
[1:56:01] nolanjruss2324: it’s really bad cuz you lose lion
[1:56:08] dlish063: lion
[1:56:10] cancerfgc: pet does more damage than lone wolf buff
[1:56:15] mrbirman: hey pshero im sure you got this question already many times but i was wondering why did you switch from mutilate to saber slash?
[1:56:32] cancerfgc: so basically you are losing pet utility, damage and also rune slot
[1:56:32] FreddiFish07: also pet can keep fighting when you get cc'd
[1:56:36] carrioncorps: the pet is what provides lion? wow
[1:56:47] dlish063: 20% for hunter
[1:56:47] ezpz_viscous: soon people in bobka's channel are gonna ask why doesnt he use saber slash like pshero
[1:56:49] doloriferous: yeah prob reduced to 5% next phase
[1:56:53] exstas1234: no its always 10% stat it doesnt increase
[1:56:56] doloriferous: then 2.5 the phase after
[1:57:04] deathaddict1995: 2 ou 3 xD
[1:57:09] exstas1234: it will still be 10% at level 60
[1:57:14] ExamanteD: its 10% not 20%
[1:57:24] ExamanteD: its just tooltip is duplicated
[1:57:27] FreddiFish07: @carrioncorps no, but if you choose lone wolf you cant take lion
[1:57:32] ekisl0l: Morning PS. Saber > Mutilate? If so, you play with 1,3 dagger in off hand?
[1:57:36] dlish063: hunter gets an extra 10%
[1:57:38] carrioncorps: @FreddiFish07 ohh
[1:57:41] deathaddict1995: its a boring rune tho, would better be nerfed and other stuff buffed
[1:57:46] Ajimoto93: no its 20% for hunter geeze lol
[1:57:52] Maynes_: no its 20% for sure
[1:57:57] Ajimoto93: 10 for everyone else
[1:58:03] ExamanteD: @Maynes_ okay let me check then
[1:58:06] carrioncorps: agree
[1:58:08] nolanjruss2324: it’s def 20% for the hunter
[1:58:09] maerentia: peepoComfy going to play some Binding of Isaac
[1:58:14] FreddiFish07: lone wolf should have buff like removing deadzone or something. ppl might actually use it then
[1:58:23] strycer1192: yeah 20% is right for the hunter, party around got 10%
