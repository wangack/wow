[2:12:53] Miseryoflife: morning hows everyone?
[2:13:01] atsq1: Hug the wall
[2:13:23] DogShep: Shaman knows he's going to wipe you so he wants to make sure the trash goes faster :D

[2:13:38] ArcaneMaki: and he's pulling 35k on a 20
[2:13:44] visaeris412: timers are so forgiving, wipes kills keys more than anything
[2:13:53] DogShep: Well ya he has to make up for his lack of dps Molv :D
[2:14:03] Bigbharash: and why is it always the lowest dps thats like go go go
[2:14:24] NiteshadezTV: lmaoooo
[2:14:26] Miseryoflife: there was a warrior in my key once that was like pull bigger and he was dying cuz he was charging in before i grouped up all the adds
[2:14:35] NiteshadezTV: because they know theyre trash so theyre pushing the timer KEKW
[2:14:49] GodKingMuninn: Mob pulls aren't limited by your tank most the time. Its limited by if your dps won't die in .3 seconds
[2:15:13] Miseryoflife: yep

[2:16:43] looney199725: @Thoreya its more the rest of the grp are underpreforming
[2:16:57] smashwow: the only thing i typically see being wrong with the "more, more, more" mentality in M+ is: If the group is failing to do things on a 4 mob pack, do you really expect an 8 mob pack to go better?
[2:17:08] largefromage: rip
[2:17:19] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[2:17:38] smashwow: i'm all for combining mob packs in M+ but if the group can't handle it, slow and steady wins the race
[2:17:40] Rhilot: swetMONKA
[2:17:49] largefromage: safe bet
[2:17:58] Tautoo: Stack on a pedal, move after hail bombs go out to the next one, and so on, all the shards all over the middle of the room make that awful
[2:18:18] dalaraz: they didnt clear thundering,cause healer had to go far to drop the circle @Towelliee
[2:18:25] xghostyyx: people got caught in thunder lmao i think or chillstorm
[2:18:34] ArcaneMaki: Did not clear because not Chad enough

[2:25:30] PvtHudson093: Extending raid to prog Mythic Raz means that he still needs to get 3 slots for warrior vault to hopefully get some upgrades or pieces he can turn into high level tier
[2:25:31] Miseryoflife: they dont
[2:25:32] aleck1776: I dont think so

[2:38:22] Mayorbeeohyayy: Hey @towelliee I wasn’t around when you were leveling and I was wondering if you leveled as tank preps on your toons
[2:38:34] Miseryoflife: all totem of the master is to good to give up
[2:38:36] Kydar: @Miseryoflife in that case, % maybe isn't as good of a judge. because you or SliggyLoL might be doing more button presses/dmg

[2:40:09] Miseryoflife: i didnt play when infested was a thing what did it do?
[2:40:09] dirtydeus: Now is this worse then prideful though?
[2:40:10] Durnikk: and it also doesnt feel impactful at all
[2:40:15] Masqerader: they did that shit backwards
