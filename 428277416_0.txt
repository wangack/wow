[3:13:42] grimsenvy: Irl streams are not cringe man
[3:13:48] Near49: @Trongan it's because they don't want to change item stats as the game progresses. Every item will be in its 1.12 state.

[3:18:27] Near49: @BirdMann they're not using the code. They just took it as reference and remade the game to work on their current client. So there are still some onconsistencies which they can find by comparing it to their in-house running 1.12. server
[3:18:31] BIIRNER: whats the CD on vanish?

[4:09:22] OmniSaber: layering is not sharding
[4:09:23] Lucid_Jaydee: @JakenbakeLIVE It only going to be for launch
[4:09:23] Pred95: They have to do layering or there's gonna be massive lag
[4:09:23] Mike0_o: BlessRNG
[4:09:24] Psych_28: no
[4:09:24] resskyyy: only on launch
[4:09:25] Drameon: no
[4:09:27] electrified69: =-)
[4:09:28] dlowhite: no
[4:09:30] misanity: its kinda phasing but not really
[4:09:31] TheMooney: no its different
[4:09:32] resskyyy: not phasing
[4:09:33] krupt2012: Layering is their new sharding
[4:09:34] La_Fourmi: yes
[4:09:35] Hakusa: Would layering be like channels?
[4:09:36] TheMooney: but its only for launch
[4:09:37] Aegrial: it's different phasing
[4:09:38] Pred95: Layering is just there's Server 1, 2, 3 etc. not just for the area
[4:09:38] Psych_28: think like photoshop layers
[4:09:40] MsNIKITA: @JakenbakeLIVE How long is your longest continuous stay in Japan ?
[4:09:40] electrified69: tee heee
[4:09:40] Drameon: layering is MUCH better than sharding (phasing) @JakenbakeLIVE
[4:09:41] ConorK1: its not as bad as phasing. they made new tech specifically for vanilla
[4:09:51] Deschumi: unfortunately stress test starts at 1am here... stupid work
[4:09:52] electrified69: mousey?
[4:09:54] Yuvall: its like having different channels but you can switch between them unless youre invited to a group
[4:09:54] Rawkydennis: everyone just uses phasing broadly
[4:09:58] Pred95: It splits the server up, not just areas
[4:09:59] Psych_28: a layer is a copy of the entire world
[4:10:03] panadoleno: can we get bigger backpack?
[4:10:05] electrified69: QuakerXnc
[4:10:05] PoppShop: basically creates a server within another server
[4:10:09] krupt2012: layering is larger scale
[4:10:10] electrified69: ''
[4:10:10] PoppShop: like channels in bdo @lacari
[4:10:11] anns33n: like korean mmos but random
[4:10:15] Lucid_Jaydee: Its only server based not all servers like it it in retail
[4:10:16] Moobot: New to stream? Why is Jake in Japan? A quick intro: https://clips.twitch.tv/SlipperyVastDinosaurKappaWealth jnbStory
[4:10:18] SteliokontosRSK: sub servers on a server
[4:10:20] Rev111: its like an extra server on top of the original
[4:10:20] ned___slark: layers are like servers within servers
[4:10:22] Turalyaz: When you log in you get put on a layer
[4:10:22] MrE942: Haha Sharting xD who Sharted
[4:10:25] Zeverus21: layering to prevent server crashes
[4:10:26] OmniSaber: @JakenbakeLIVE think if as like channel on BDO
[4:10:27] La_Fourmi: it like "channel" in certain mmo but you can't switch manualy
[4:10:31] electrified69: wap
[4:10:31] Rev111: Which only exists when 1 is full
[4:10:35] xPete: so basically temporary servers untiil they merge them again when playerbase goes down
[4:10:36] electrified69: '
[4:10:38] TheMooney: yeah it is
[4:10:38] manz1: @MrE942 haHAA

[4:10:41] DScimitar: yes
[4:10:44] resskyyy: yes
[4:10:45] electrified69: easy?
[4:10:48] krupt2012: Id imagine we'll see layering whenever population is high
[4:10:48] ConorK1: should only last 1-4 weeks soomething like that
[4:10:50] Rawkydennis: I really hope it doesnt effect world pvp
[4:10:51] PoppShop: its going to be like a full size retail wow server per layer
[4:10:52] „Å¶„ÅÉ„ÇìÈõ∂„ÄÖ‰∏É: When is launch date?

[4:11:14] electrified69: o
[4:11:15] pipzer: Booty Bay Lacari WeirdChamp
[4:11:16] Malthorius: They are testing it tonight
[4:11:17] Drameon: layering is across the whole eastern kingdoms and kalimdor and its only server specific, so you will still only see people from your server @JakenbakeLIVE

[4:11:51] Drameon: barrens Pog
[4:11:51] Rawkydennis: barrens is like 11
[4:11:52] Rof__: layering creates virtual servers and then fills the virtual servers to server cap then the players after that instead of being put in a queue get put into the second virtual server, and unlike BDO you cant move freely between them
