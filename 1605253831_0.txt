[1:15:46] Cosmolus: I think people who don't do all types of content can't really complain though. You are choosing not playing a part of the game. So it's only reasonable that you don't level/gear as someone that plays the game in full.

[1:45:53] warrenny: @mizerboy Better then master loot
[1:45:54] alex_mograine: i like that blizzard has embraced the fact that classic and retail can learn from each other.
[1:46:04] abracka_: honestly it's just a way nicer feeling seeing loot pop up for roll
[1:46:13] mizerboy: @mizerboy I sure hope they did. I will be optimistic
[1:46:19] dad_of_four: nobody like magic loot distribution though its nice to see whats happening
[1:46:29] Loktow: But the game is deciding if you need it
[1:46:32] Lonedh: Have blizzard confirmed cross faction guilds yet?
[1:46:38] Mecabeast: yeah looks like group loot is a modified need before greed
[1:46:40] abracka_: yeah you guys stomped that shit lol
[1:47:01] warrenny: @mecabeast Thats what it was originally right?
[1:47:10] Daarksyde: Morning @Towelliee ! Time to party, I just got DF Beta from opt-in!
[1:47:25] warrenny: @lonecurse Not yet sadly

[1:48:39] Tehsunman: Suits ResidentSleeper
[1:48:43] Tehsunman: ruin everything
[1:48:52] GamertagTIKI: gotta get it before MS takes over
[1:48:54] Wulfgrym: suits also pay for everything
[1:49:06] alex_mograine: you can reaklly only blame indie company devs because they have more control
[1:49:16] KnightmareV2: with the money earned by devs not suits
[1:49:20] alex_mograine: even that doesnt apply most times
[1:49:23] WhatAboutBob71: You dont get bonuses if you dont release new products. Suits love bonuses.
[1:49:26] piratechris: @Wulfgrym Suits spend the company money, which is created by the creative talent. So that my friend is a stretch
[1:49:35] Tehsunman: ^
[1:49:39] Wulfgrym: yeah unfortunately not how the world works
[1:49:44] Quojin: Devs just do what they get told to do, jstt like tthe rest of us numbers
[1:49:45] Tehsunman: Suits only reap the rewards
[1:50:05] alex_mograine: suits have pretty much ruined everything in the modern world, all about that green paper
[1:50:20] Tehsunman: They say money is the root of all evil!
[1:50:35] WhatAboutBob71: @Wulfgrym Business says otherwise. You have to sell something to make money and creative types normally dont know how to do that.
[1:50:48] alex_mograine: @Tehsunman i think a better term is that money exposes everyones bad sides
[1:50:59] Tehsunman: @alex_mograine i'd agree
[1:51:08] WhatAboutBob71: ^
[1:51:59] alex_mograine: unluigi
[1:52:17] abbott012: What is  the frozen orb used for?
[1:52:29] Tehsunman: crafting?
[1:52:32] Aquadriel: @Towelliee think about this as mental preparation for DF raid loot in 2 months KEKW
[1:52:33] Wulfgrym: i agree, when accountants started making more of the decisions, things go down hill
[1:52:34] KnightmareV2: crsfting
[1:52:38] alex_mograine: yeah its like primal nether
[1:52:41] Quojin: yes crafting
[1:52:43] ClassicMalcontent: L76 now and I'm still getting Grizzly in the Hills. Looking forward to flying and when I can get 'that Heroic lootz'
[1:53:19] gabizaoluz: is this hc?
[1:53:25] carmelchaos: Its too bad we never found the new kingdom Kappa
[1:53:26] vulkankragon: the loading screen is still in 4:3 format

[2:04:47] onous_: Is it true that you can't pump your own gas in Jersey?
[2:04:57] RocketMan23: tick tock diner?
[2:05:02] kjdocs: True
[2:05:11] kjdocs: yeah Jersey is Dinner capital
[2:05:38] Shurn_82: @NoTToXiCLuL that liquid sugar and acidity is horrible for us (i drink a lot of soda too) I got Fatty liver disease from way too much liquid sugar water haha

[2:07:46] Shurn_82: @NoTToXiCLuL As science says, sugar is not meant to be consumed as much as it is in modern society. It used to be a 'Treat' and not a stable in most diets. Corn based sugars aer the worst of the worse
[2:08:17] llNoTToXiCll: maybe you shouldnt always follow the science maybe just a little bit but not always
[2:09:32] LSBreed: didn't this fight always have LOS issues

[2:11:00] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: You gave him your sack...
[2:11:02] mintcookie_vajankle: I remember you could stack everyone tight in a corner and the fire orbs would mostly be avoided by the clipping of the invisible walls around the arena
[2:11:25] Sanctana827: the fireballs arent the problem here
[2:11:46] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:12:22] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Think you need to save CD's for the feed phase to break them out by nuking boss
[2:12:22] LSBreed: I think it is
[2:12:29] Betrayedtaco: u just gotta dps the boss enough to break the spell
[2:12:31] Sanctana827: iirc the healer would have to help dps the boss to stop him from damaging the player.
[2:12:54] Ertra: yeah you have to dps the boss enough to get him to break his 'hold'

[2:17:05] KronasKG: @Towelliee  but you said a dungeon boss was hard..... how can the a dungeon boss be hard and the expansion generally easy?!?!?!?!?!?!? (Sarcasm)
[2:17:09] soeholttt: What shoulders do you have on?
[2:17:10] Shurn_82: 540 def rating
[2:17:24] Shurn_82: @headshot_hunter6 540 is cap i believe

[2:18:07] soeholttt: 541 is defense cap
[2:18:09] soeholttt: not 540
[2:18:15] Shurn_82: incorrect
[2:18:57] Betrayedtaco: you tank him anywhere, when u get debuff u run to healthy shroom and kill it to clear the debuff
[2:19:00] soeholttt: I mean you can go for 540- but i prefer 541
[2:19:13] Shurn_82: 540 is cap based on the calc
[2:19:18] headshot_hunter6: Defense cap for Raid is 540, the cap for heroics is only 535
[2:19:22] Shurn_82: 541 is fine too
[2:20:22] Shurn_82: i mean , going over 1 point is not going to be bad
[2:20:42] Shurn_82: I need to get my ass in gear to level the lock
[2:20:47] ottavianni: hunter traps ?
[2:20:58] soeholttt: WC2 MUSIC pog
[2:21:23] Shurn_82: the spare boss is a paing but yea

[2:22:30] Shurn_82: @91Niki both games I likely wont touch, so you have 1 less person to worry about  ;)
[2:22:33] lorddrekken: hey grats on 80 man
[2:22:48] The_PatientZero: Did they just give out beta with the release announcement? My friend and I both got it
[2:23:00] yaokboomer: @91Niki OMEGALUL
[2:23:02] Siddydiddydo: Didn't the last big COD relerase break the bnet login servers?
[2:23:12] 91Niki: @Shurn_82 You're not gonna play DF ? :O
[2:23:13] Shurn_82: Bnet servers @Towelliee ..might not be able to log into your account to launch games haha
[2:23:21] warrenny: Think mw2 be like the old mw series?
[2:23:24] 91Niki: Yeah Bnet servers. Not wow servers.
[2:23:34] gabizaoluz: how was the test yesterday?
[2:23:36] Shurn_82: @91Niki noep, the new wows are IN MY OPINION trash
[2:24:18] Sanctana827: @Towelliee What are your thoughts on the race to world first for Dragonflight now that all 3 difficulties are released on the same date?
[2:24:19] Shurn_82: @91Niki the rep grinds, limited dailies, the fucking elitist groups who wont let you in a basic instance...its just not worth the struggle anymore to play 2 -3 days a week
[2:25:00] ItsMetalTV: chat whats the command for the xp bar he had yesterday
[2:25:10] 91Niki: @ItsMetalTV !WA

[2:25:40] Shurn_82: @91Niki   I love the games, just finding a guild EAST coast that doenst raid past 9pm (I work early) is hard to find too
[2:26:10] 91Niki: @Shurn_82 Gotcha. I personally stopped worrying about raiding and went full casual. Makes the game a lot more fun and a lot less demanding of my time
[2:26:29] xavier2119: @Shurn_82 im the same way. and all my friends play on west coast servers for whatever fuckin reason so I don't ever get to raid
[2:26:42] Shurn_82: @Shurn_82 I hear you, but I love the raiding aspect of the game
[2:27:01] yaokboomer: @Shurn_82 so are you saying its not worth playing if your brand new nowadays?
[2:27:05] theoriginalzinng: clearly it titanforged
[2:27:21] George2001k: @towelliee less than two months away from starting to level my professions. So much hype! I just hope we will be able to craft the best gear from mythic plus reagents.
[2:27:59] KronasKG: Its only worrysome fr the WFR....  not alot of others would be to affected

[2:34:32] ScipiiTv: Hellu mate, how are you? Im all good! Mate i got a curious question. What would you think of new race recruting, Centaurens for the Horde and Dryads for the alliance? 2 cavalry like races.
[2:34:42] skrin001: i get to play the beta today. I finally got access last night
[2:34:44] theoriginalzinng: they fixed most to all of the quest bugs
[2:34:51] tedol: yea, 60 days enough for that
[2:34:51] Strouss: you doing raid test today?
[2:34:58] Shurn_82: @Towelliee so were you right with the release date! I was pretty tired when we talked about it in your mini-thon
[2:34:58] SonofHorus82: raid releasing on launch?
[2:35:01] wasserhammer: I got beta overnight!
[2:35:02] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee except for the talents that are still not working?  Or is that one of those it's probably been fixed on another internal build?
[2:35:20] hippieh8rlol: honestly have seen more bugs in Wrath Classic than DF Beta recently lol
[2:35:25] theoriginalzinng: you think next week we will start seeing testable tier sets?
[2:35:50] Timothious: You gotten anything this mornin?
[2:36:21] stevefrencherton: @Towelliee playing wow for the first time in probably 10 years.. its so confusing and i love it
[2:36:58] Shurn_82: Did they mention prepatch for DF? how long, when ?  @Towelliee \
[2:37:27] GamingDad77: @Shurn_82 according to leaked dates, oct 26th

[2:38:16] Roaringkittylol: So WOTLK is legit just content for a lot of streamers until Dragonflight releases?
[2:38:30] Pallyofhell: im glad they're focusing on fixing bugs rather than tuning
[2:38:32] Broomba: thank god i beta df before it release, so i can play, report bugs which i did several times last night and enjoy the story and questing
[2:38:34] DoughBoi_Trev: @yoloblocks negative bud
[2:38:39] Armdel: are they time gating the raids for wotlk launch?
[2:38:44] tedol: @Yoloblocks  I guess
[2:38:45] DoughBoi_Trev: @yoloblocks that's some peepothinking brother
[2:38:52] Roaringkittylol: You think it has staying power @trev_mastr
[2:39:18] DoughBoi_Trev: its 3 or 4 days in now and still has 1 to 3 hour queues
[2:39:21] Shurn_82: @Broomba atta boy...they need more peopel actually testing and reporting bugs
[2:39:37] Armdel: can't wait +5% flat damage instead of talent balancing
[2:39:39] mrsuflakis: its going to be the same specs al always
[2:39:41] GamingDad77: I got an e-mail about my beta access. It literally said my play time is to minimal in order to be granted access. RIP

[2:40:37] mintcookie_vajankle: For once I wanna see Feral be overtuned 10% ahead of any other spec in the game
[2:41:37] 91Niki: @Vajankle_Kj towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:41:44] Lorilath: problem is if the talents have multipiers in a 5% buff could end up being a 6% increase for one class or a 15% for another still I prefer that to other methods
[2:41:49] DoughBoi_Trev: See I love watching @towelliee play LK Classic cause he's not sperg leveling like majority of the streamers are
[2:41:58] Timothious: wow hunter putting it out

[2:45:07] amricatt: I finally got beta today!  Woo!
[2:45:49] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I think the healer cares
[2:45:53] DoughBoi_Trev: how many of yall getting beta access actually going to TEST out game functions and mechanics and report back to devs ??
[2:46:13] DoughBoi_Trev: and how many of yall are excited about beta cause you are basicly getting early access to the game?
[2:46:16] DiiscoViking: I test and report
[2:46:40] izzlarn65: I play how I normally do and report anything I see that isn't working properly
[2:46:50] stermo321: üëÄ
[2:46:50] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[2:46:59] amricatt: @trev_mastr I also test and report.
[2:47:00] 91Niki: I'm very scared of burning myself out. But I have leveled a bit, as well as tested some profession stuff. Handed in a handful of bug reports
[2:47:01] PokerFaceMoose: when you erp with a dubious looking nelf in cutthroat alley
[2:47:01] byrdeen45: i just want into beta
[2:47:02] Shurn_82: this will be the first beta, I have not gotten early . . . and weird thing, I only bought Shadowlands a month ago haha
[2:47:04] PokerFaceMoose: blizzard gets it all
[2:47:08] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: My ex was a support main in all games, like Overwatch. Even when I said I'm good on tank and I'm diving, don't worry about me. She'd see me get low before I used ult and go into panic mode and chase me down. It was like a personal failure if I died.
[2:47:15] AssaultF4: lol asmongold
[2:47:18] CodeMasterr: lol i was bout to say
[2:47:20] warrenny: Got evoker to 65 kinda done with beta inthink
[2:47:21] AssaultF4: seeing wht he can break
[2:47:24] CodeMasterr: mr gm test those cracks
[2:47:40] TweektheProphet: I usually just do a bunch of lvling
[2:47:44] amricatt: I'm a QAer in my rl job.  I like to break things.
[2:47:51] DoughBoi_Trev: yeah I haven't pre-ordered cause I don't want beta , I ruined last 3 xpacs experience for myself doing beta for those
[2:48:02] DoughBoi_Trev: so release came and there was very little luster and excitement
[2:48:10] DallTV_: 3
[2:48:19] DallTV_: ha
[2:48:23] DallTV_: heya peeps
[2:48:33] 91Niki: @DallDK ijpHI
[2:48:35] Shurn_82: I test most of the betas to see if i want to play the xpac, but if things are borked I reported them . . . its typically how I gauge if i want to play the xpac haha
[2:49:08] yaokboomer: @Shurn_82 whats the difference between classic wow and normal?
[2:49:11] warrenny: @shurn_82 If beta has bugs you dont play?
[2:49:29] 91Niki: @trev_mastr If you feel like you wanna help test, you can always join the 70 pre made server, test some professions, or dungeons and raids. Leveling for me also ruins my experience when it goes live
[2:49:48] TheCheeseWheel87: I sometimes feel like I'm over reporting but on Windwalker some of the talents are comsuming 2 talent points for rank 1 and rank 2 spells or spells just not graphically working or even tooltips being correctly spelt/grammar etc.
[2:49:49] byrdeen45: Anyone in beta is the new class any fun cant wait to try it
[2:49:55] DallTV_: 91Niki haii =) <3
[2:50:00] Shurn_82: @warrenny no i play it, if it has bugs report them like you should...but I also play the beta to see if i want to even bother playing the main game when it realeased

[2:50:25] Featherbow: @yaokboomer retail follows the flow of time and is the most recent expansion. Classic goes back to previous expansions before major system changes.
[2:50:44] DoughBoi_Trev: @yaokboomer classic = before all the quality of life changes before retail
[2:50:47] Alienfromger: this flying is not intended?
[2:50:56] EasilyZeroed: that hunter dps though
[2:51:02] 91Niki: @TheCheeseWheel87 Yeah the ww monk talent tree is a mess. But I know they are working on fixing it
[2:51:20] DoughBoi_Trev: she's always Entombed the party
[2:51:21] Shurn_82: @yaokboomer classic = old game from like 10+ years ago being re-released for the nostalgia       normal (or retail as some call it ) is the game currently being released   /    the game plays are different
[2:51:32] Shurn_82: @yaokboomer well said
[2:51:33] theoriginalzinng: did questing in the last few zones always give emblems?
[2:51:34] cptncadillac: she did that back in the day but nowdays people just stomp her on retail
[2:51:42] amricatt: Oh I have.  I don't think it's the norm though.  Has something to do which version you engage.  I don't know exactly.
[2:51:59] theoriginalzinng: or is that a #somechanges thing
[2:52:18] Shurn_82: @theoriginalzinng quality of life thing
[2:53:22] TheCheeseWheel87: @TheCheeseWheel87 Oh for sure, it just makes me sad since i WW main and alot of the monk stuff doesnt work: like Chi torpedo having the roll animation absolutely bugs the hell out of me lol
[2:53:44] yaokboomer: Gotcha so what is currently the most popular retail or classic?
[2:53:55] Shurn_82: retail
[2:53:57] Shurn_82: by far
[2:54:06] Densetsu_: isnt Sarth and Malygos open?
[2:54:07] 91Niki: @TheCheeseWheel87 Very understandable! It's annoying that you can't test your class. I know fixing bugs like that is their top priority atm tho
[2:54:12] delavor1: ye pretty much
[2:54:23] Shurn_82: yea, i think retail has a lot more players over the long term
[2:54:35] delavor1: im surprised Wrath didnt get that much attention outside of the WoW community
[2:54:37] Mourningztar: That fuck you money
[2:54:38] Shurn_82: classic goes through spikes off and on, based on content released in it

[2:55:57] Attackroot: Got my beta invite finally!

[2:56:15] alejote: ugh, classic
[2:56:54] bloodogg35: it doesnt matter to me i dont worry about it till november
[2:57:11] EasilyZeroed: wow token went from 130k to 230k on my server

[2:57:32] Sanctana827: @dirtydieselx not based on server. its based on region
[2:57:35] Shrenko: @dirtydieselx its not server based
[2:57:39] bloodogg35: its at 260 on mine
[2:57:43] EasilyZeroed: ahhh wasn't sure
[2:57:44] Shurn_82: @th30dor you get a free tail?
[2:57:48] headshot_hunter6: isnt the auctionhouse region wide, so the wow token isnt server
[2:57:49] EasilyZeroed: but currently 230k
[2:57:57] MarquisLek: remember when it was half that much
[2:58:00] EasilyZeroed: 130k less than a month ago

[3:31:04] dyslexican1: I mean this is the way MMO's have alwasy been. not everyone is going to be on the cutting edge of raids/deongens ect. There is nothing wrong with that. But if you cant spend tons of hours playing in general then you wont be onthe leading edge. It has literally ALWAYS been that way.
[3:31:15] dyslexican1: I dont understand this complaint.
[3:31:25] Shurn_82: @dyslexican1 exactly, and well said
[3:31:29] Wulfgrym: i think the change makes the race more interesting for the race

[3:34:24] dyslexican1: @Gingerprimer Yeah I mean also true. iwe cant all be ont hat leading ege.. some of us have lives and stuff. But thats fine, I think its a silly complaint to have. Either say " this game is my priority so im gong to set aside everything else for it." OR " im going to play when i can cus I preoritized life." no wrong answer. just silly to complain about. I dont get what they are on about.

[3:36:26] rsimpson105: I still think they should have not done naxx 2.0 and done like an Azjol raid instead
[3:36:31] Ryenonn: Do you think they will use the PVE systems from Overwatch engine to build next Warcraft game?
[3:36:34] Timothious: what does GDKP stand for?
[3:36:36] Pallyofhell: shield spikes are so easy to make and they go for 300g each right now

[3:39:24] Wulfgrym: @Broomba wen wow2?
[3:39:27] mintcookie_vajankle: The best we can hope for is WoD classic, but its WoD+ with all the cut content but more after. Thats the next Warcraft game in my dreams.
[3:39:51] TheBoogs: @towelliee will you come to my wedding if I send you an invite? It was a few years ago
[3:39:57] Broomba: @Wulfgrym never
[3:40:09] Pallyofhell: not having RDF was kinda a dumb move
[3:40:23] Wulfgrym: @Broomba lol but people will keep asking
[3:40:27] dyslexican1: I don;t get no RDF, itsa quality of life change that has only made things better. Itsa HUGE mistake.
[3:40:27] Gingerprimer: or if you are dps
[3:40:36] NerdyTeK: i wish they added the regular LFG in form retail
[3:40:41] Broomba: @Wulfgrym yep, and people hope that it will happen
[3:40:43] Mourningztar: In the spirit of classic
[3:40:47] Maydie6066: but @Towelliee RDF isn't the spirit of classic Kappa
[3:40:48] NBK_Sethus: you make friends or join a guild, crazy I know
[3:40:54] domfx: agreed, they are definitely missing that
[3:41:01] Pallyofhell: RDF is the spirit of classic LUL
[3:41:02] SerFloyd: yeah i don't think i've heard one person say that they're happy dungeon finder isn't in
[3:41:02] Rightzzz: Rightzzz subscribed with Prime. 
[3:41:03] Amarlian: i still say, they should have a server or two without it and the rest have it, even if it's not cross server
[3:41:05] doublemeatpalace: I feel like all these people saying they want lfd back are the ones who said it was what ruined the game
[3:41:10] Wulfgrym: @Broomba although, now that Microsoft will be in charge, its a slight chance,
[3:41:10] fruitvendorx: Just bring back the normal lfg, screw this "be social" thing in wotlk
[3:41:21] NerdyTeK: fuck the sprit of classic i aint tryna walk all day .. thats y i dont go outside
[3:41:23] Meakis: Helloo
[3:41:41] Broomba: @Wulfgrym dont think wow 2 will ever happen
[3:41:49] tmiguel27: When they will add Megaservers like GW2? Crossfaction is already a thing is just one push away
[3:41:53] Pallyofhell: how else am i suppose to camp rares while waiting for a que Kappa
[3:41:54] gairefear: wait one second
[3:42:04] gairefear: This isn't the dragonflight beta I was promised
[3:42:08] Broomba: what will wow 2 be like? centered around? would it be a mmorpg, fps?
[3:42:27] dyslexican1: "in the spirit of classic" needst o figure out hwo I can put in 12+hours every day like i coudl when i was 15 then.. till they do the classic Andys can STFU.
[3:42:36] Dkgungo: @Broomba why would it be a fps lmao
[3:42:39] Wulfgrym: @Broomba i agree highly unlikely.
[3:42:55] dyslexican1: how*
[3:42:59] Gingerprimer: There is also no real reason for wow 2
[3:43:05] Broomba: @Dkgungo leave it to reddit to put forth stupid and drunk suggestions
[3:43:05] LspN: Damn, so less than 2 months to DF
[3:43:07] ArcaneMaki: Is there any news on Tua' well being?
[3:43:11] Wulfgrym: classic andys are all hypocrites, they are playing wotlk, not vanilla or tbc
[3:43:17] gairefear: Kill em all, they deserve it
[3:43:24] Broomba: thats where the wow 2 crap came from Reditt
[3:44:01] gairefear: Obviously there wont be a WoW 2, cus a game has to be good to get a 2 like overwatch Kekw
[3:44:02] Wulfgrym: reddit the home of the good idea fairy
[3:44:06] NerdyTeK: its not gunna be called world of warcraft 2 is gunna be call warcraft universe and we going to space

[3:44:45] Broomba: @NerdyTeK we will go to space in wow in an expansion
[3:44:55] Nuvak1711: I mean....I guess Antorus doesn't count as going to space
[3:45:09] Nuvak1711: Seems like killing a world soul meant nothing
[3:45:17] Wulfgrym: yeah join the space goats and explore the stars
[3:45:18] VahnillaGorilla: 3rd ability is a channel one of them should be using it at all times
[3:45:27] EthicalHermit: Drakes scale with ilevel, or at least they used to
[3:45:27] Broomba: wow in space for an expansion regards the race in tbc that look like aliens and glittering

[3:47:05] mintcookie_vajankle: its pretty easy with 4 green drakes
[3:47:09] Shurn_82: coincidence
[3:47:17] VahnillaGorilla: Have one of your bronze's use the third ability all time. Its the debuff. And then have the bronze guys space out their second ability every 20 seconds
[3:47:27] NerdyTeK: @Shurn_82 TheIlluminati
[3:47:30] Wulfgrym: lets just let the cult of light take over and change azeroth
[3:47:38] abracka_: roll with 3 red drakes, 1 bronze and 1 green. the 1 bronze just keeps casting the channeled ability while the red blow him up
[3:47:45] Shurn_82: @Towelliee isnt there a timelapse or something that you dump deeps or is that a diff encounter
[3:47:49] loragheta: yeah doing the achievement for this place was actually the fastest way to do it. spam bronze drakes GG

[4:03:08] Skulligan79: Oh they're making Ulduar normal/heroic modes?  That would be great!  I never liked the "hard mode" things.
[4:03:09] Suligane: How was the MRI @Towelliee ?

[4:04:21] mikejames01: sub= no ads or twitch turbo
[4:04:24] ochiero_amarru: why not just go to the training dummies to train weapon skill
[4:04:36] GamingDad77: @king_rhino88 doesn't work
[4:04:43] ahies28: havent seen a add in years
[4:04:45] healmore49: I love turbo
[4:04:48] AmZambie: @Gingerprimer nope my generosity is spent today lol
[4:04:52] Pallyofhell: it doesnt work
[4:05:04] ochiero_amarru: they should work
[4:05:07] BafflingRainbow: what ads lol
[4:05:14] ochiero_amarru: i remember doing that back in wrath
[4:05:14] Pallyofhell: no it shouldnt work
[4:05:14] JackedDown: Lmao no, that's never worked
[4:05:14] ivsaken: if you put on all green int gear, you can max weapon skill in 4 minutes
[4:05:17] RevelDoc: RevelDoc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:05:23] Skulligan79: That never worked back in the day.  You had to go out in the field and stare blankly at the screen while auto-attacking.
[4:05:24] BoezIRL: it worked on private server Kappa
[4:05:25] Soulofdragon01: you can switch weapons in combat so you at least survive
[4:05:28] WhatAboutBob71: didnt work for me, ever
[4:05:29] EthicalHermit: are there still the immune mobs in front of the Dark Portal? That's how I did it back in the day
[4:05:31] Gingerprimer: @AmZambie yeah just joking I almost never get adds due to twitch not selling adds in my market (sweden)
[4:05:38] Pallyofhell: but it worked on a private server Kappa
[4:05:48] WhatAboutBob71: LUL
[4:05:49] AmZambie: nice
[4:05:54] ic3k0ld: it's a training dummy, it would make sense
[4:05:55] LSBreed: I just used to fight the mobs below dalaran to level weapons
[4:05:58] Broomba: a game thats been out for almost 20 years still brings out the "experts"
[4:06:48] LSBreed: can't remember what they were, I just remember because their level it went fast.
[4:07:11] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Yeah, int+fast weapon speed makes it insanely fast. Even faster if you're a DK, cause when a rune cost ability misses, the rune is refunded
[4:07:13] mintcookie_vajankle: Dalaran has vendors that selss white quality weapons of the fastest speed. I think the axe is 1.6
[4:07:22] Pallyofhell: reddit is probably on fire
[4:07:22] magemaster225: imagine fi they brought weapon skill back in retail and you had to earn all the expansions without it
[4:07:33] LSBreed: don't forget to level unarmed
[4:07:36] ivsaken: are there unkillable mobs still from invasion event?
[4:07:45] Wulfgrym: reddit, where braincells go to die
[4:07:48] Pallyofhell: he's not wrong LUL
[4:07:52] TheUnknowing: cant blame the guy
[4:07:58] DeCoyThatGuy: @towelliee what i did to level my weapon and unarmed skill (even on my mage) was to go into Violent Hold and DONT start the dungeon. the forever spawning of the non elite mobs at the beginning. i just pull 1 aside and auto attack
[4:08:01] cybx89: we already have a date for the pre patch ? im just waiting for it to get back =P
[4:08:08] Pallyofhell: honestly i think i enjoyed WoD more than shadowlands
[4:08:22] Kdrman34: only think I hate about the release date is that it's like a week before Exams for me
[4:08:24] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Shadowlands was the FASTEST expansion I quit. I didn't leave WoD until half way through Hellfire Citadel
[4:08:40] ZeroNpcTV: im pretty excited for DF but im hoping it wont be bad
[4:08:58] Skulligan79: Dude already bought it yesterday lol
[4:09:06] iiTornTunaii: Every expansion is amazing for the first month or two, I have never regretted an expansion in the beginning
[4:09:19] PhoenixAuTv: !ui

[4:09:23] Smokey16: @Towelliee After seeing the new DF video blizzard released it dawned on me that I havent seen anything about what there will be to do in the expansion. Is there anything besides dungeons and raids?
[4:09:26] MoonwalkingAngel79: leveling is always fun
[4:09:30] Pallyofhell: shadowlands wasnt amazing the first 2 months
[4:09:51] Roaringkittylol: DF zones look c ool lol
[4:09:54] abracka_: "let me judge my entire opinion on one trailer"
[4:09:56] Masqerader: "wait for price drop" then dude be complaining about leveling takes to long
[4:09:57] LearnedSomething: idk man, I don't have any counterpoints for anything he said there
[4:10:02] TheFuriyon: Speaking of bad wow trailers; nothing beats 4.3s trailer
[4:10:12] Gingerprimer: I also think that the trail looked cool ngl
[4:10:17] mintcookie_vajankle: There's so much detail in the new zones that I have to update my GPU lol
[4:10:34] SerFloyd: the trailer was basically "you can ride dragons"
[4:10:40] deadman385: I thought it was koo
[4:10:40] gidgeet: it wasn't one of their best trailers
[4:10:44] ivsaken: are they letting hybrid specs be viable with new talent tree?
[4:10:54] Masqerader: WOD had a good trailer and look how that went
[4:10:56] Masqerader: so ya...
[4:11:02] PanoramicPanda: there was a model animation glitch in the trailer with one of the stone bois
[4:11:04] aribellae: @Towelliee do you think they'll hit they're release date?
[4:11:06] PhoenixAuTv: The dragonflight trailer was 0/10. I'm excited to play the expansion tho but the trailer was hot garbadge
[4:11:13] diivil92: why did i get wrath beta and not DF beta lol
[4:11:16] Gingerprimer: @ivsaken you can pick up more utility in your class tree but not really like how it was back in the dya
[4:11:17] Jango_: we all just need to come to terms with the fact that wow's best days are behind it, not trying to be negative just realistic
[4:11:20] aribellae: *there
[4:11:26] Wulfgrym: thats just not commited to a release if you spending time with your family
[4:11:34] Pallyofhell: blizzard is trolling ppl with the wrath beta invites still LUL
[4:11:44] Wulfgrym: im kidding lol
[4:11:46] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:11:53] Smokey16: What content is there after hitting 70?
[4:11:56] xrandomdoodx: with dragon riding, the zones don't actually feel as big as they are, coming from someone who leveled on beta to max level
[4:11:58] JackedDown: Not like they have 20 years of holiday play data to go off of
[4:12:00] BlewGamingGroup: release it at thanksgiving and people complain about having to level when they should be getting fat at the dinner table and spending money on black friday
[4:12:08] diivil92: i will be playing fuck my family
[4:12:14] baldoon501: Also people have to give up vacation to support the launch
[4:12:18] deadman385: didn't shadowlands come out thanksgiving
[4:12:28] xmirrxrs: KEKW
[4:12:35] Shurn_82: canada up here, working off our T-giving

[4:12:39] LearnedSomething: launch my game
[4:12:41] Masqerader: these fuckers will complain about playing on xmas and tg but will stand in like for 12 hrs to buy a tv on black friday
[4:12:48] SerFloyd: blizzard is a us based company though
[4:12:54] noosphear: Plus, Blizzard is probably trying to give the majority of their employees at least Thanksgiving off work.
[4:12:56] Wulfgrym: might still screw up some raiders plans, travelling might not work out
[4:12:57] Masqerader: *line
[4:13:12] onybear: I am ecstatic that is the release date...I get the hoilidays off and I can take a week off after...I get 12 days off for the price of 5 vacation days
[4:13:12] diivil92: MYTHIC WEEK ONE BABY

[4:14:08] warrenny: Thanksgiving whats that? Kappa
[4:14:09] falldrgn: Imean.. people think that their opinion (while valid) is the only awnser and anyone else is wrong.
[4:14:37] Wulfgrym: @dyslexican1 its a new region you haven't explored, like a new continent in wow
[4:14:53] ProverbX: did they say when the prepatch would be?
[4:14:55] rebuk: They also want to enjoy their own holidays which coincide with my holidays :D
[4:15:02] dyslexican1: @Wulfgrym It sounds scarry, I don't like the sound of it.
[4:15:05] brysins: @ProverbX oct 28

[4:15:58] Densetsu_: I wish DF had a tad more dungeons, 8 feels a bit low. 10-12 would be nice
[4:16:02] mikejames01: SL was Nov 23, 2020
[4:16:25] Putcride: shadowlands was originally going to launch before halloween and then they pushed it to before thanksgiving
[4:16:31] mintcookie_vajankle: Waiting for that Wailing Caverns +25
[4:17:09] Masqerader: Bring back freehold/Maw of Souls or !riot
[4:17:17] TheFuriyon: also gotta consider how much dev time goes into making dungeons now than back before challenge/mythic+
[4:17:17] jkitchin75: @Vajankle_Kj do you have a spair day

[4:18:23] dyslexican1: Honestly. as a tank, Learning M+ for more then 10 deongens makes my simple brain hurt. the idea that we are going to only have 8 to learn makes me happy. Only have to learn 8+ roughts not 12+ at one time.. yes please.

[4:35:51] HonestPhilosophy: No one leveling as heals lol, im switching when I hit 80
[4:35:52] CodyKane: Well.. if you were on Mankrik i could be your healer!
[4:35:57] Pelasommayurek: If they bring back joyous journey I'll play my healer
[4:35:58] Zucchey: Used to heal back in the day, but on retail now it seems exhausting, constantly having to dps everything, dodge everything, keep everyone alive. It's a lot chill to be a dps
[4:36:00] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Be the change you wanna see Towelliee. Go Holy!
[4:36:06] SerFloyd: i'm holy :)
[4:36:07] GamingDad77: @ludenhofx yeah..only been playing since vanilla

[4:36:48] ZeroNpcTV: need it for my warrior D:
[4:36:52] Tenty: easier to level as healer when dungeon finder had teleportation.
[4:36:53] Eshel: @gingerprimer  Fair enough - I just wanted to mention it in case something had changed recently - never know when they‚Äôll screw around and get more efficient lol
[4:36:55] ZeroNpcTV: should've boosted it before wotlk launch
[4:37:00] Utmost777: Heirlooms lol
[4:37:03] Reaghol: i just got back fro. burying family.. ill be 80 in no time and am holy specced ^^
[4:37:32] SerFloyd: my server has the opposite problem. seems like there are plenty of healers and no tanks

[4:37:45] thecynicalshuffler: it was a real troll, move to announce the 50% xp buff for retail was coming back but it said "does not apply to classic products" ...  lol
[4:37:46] LearnedSomething: 50 each
[4:37:48] TheUnknowing: I mean, ill probably xfer off maladath when we can, the idea of a fresh server seemed great, execution doesnt seem as great lol
[4:37:52] OGlynch: they are asking for frozon orbs on my server
[4:37:58] boomerang101: per toon
[4:37:59] raldrik: theres a group with a healer and no tank, do you stay true to your dps?
[4:38:01] Khaleesi_Live_Tv: yea you'd be making tons of money i charge 30 and people pay it
[4:38:02] LearnedSomething: you wanna run those heroics better pay up :)
[4:38:11] Gingerprimer: they shoudl bring back the xp buff but only up to level 68/70

[4:39:49] inj0shwetrust: is*
[4:39:50] pk99: you already have heirlooms going to 80 like they aren't supposed to LuL
[4:39:53] LearnedSomething: do you think wotlk classic might do better than dragonflight?
[4:39:54] lorddrekken: yep wrath classic already about to be cannabalized
[4:40:00] EasilyZeroed: can anyone on Auchidon Retail make a horde orc and sign my charter? I only need one more lol
[4:40:06] hickey7979: there were heirlooms in wotlk tho
[4:40:26] Austei: after 2 week ppl be done with wrath
[4:40:43] abracka_: depends on if DF horribly fails, but that's big doubt
[4:41:02] Avengence17: Sorry im only 69 havent gotten a chance to play all week due to work
[4:41:04] Gingerprimer: @ludenhofx it is 99% sure on the 25th of october
[4:41:48] agonyzt: They should just bring back the RDF and make it server-specific. Best of both world.
[4:41:49] Recording_on_the_grass: when is pre patch?
[4:42:10] Gingerprimer: @Troots according to leak that has been correct so far 25th oct
[4:42:23] pavepawns: isnt all of the raid available tonight on normal?

[4:43:07] marcotrunzo: how long did you sleep after the 72 hour stream?
[4:43:08] Recording_on_the_grass: feels to soon
[4:43:27] Disgruntledd: You don‚Äôt think wrath is going to compete with DF at all?
[4:43:27] Recording_on_the_grass: wow 25th lol
[4:43:38] agonyzt: But it was great, the invasions were fun. More than the Wotlk prepatch invasions.
[4:43:47] marcotrunzo: your body prob needed 12 hours after that lol
[4:44:05] its_Xeph: So the prepatch is sometime at the end of  October?
[4:44:06] GamingDad77: he didn't stay up for the whole 72 hours
[4:44:11] TheUnknowing: I mean they dont have to compete, they have their own crowds.
[4:44:12] Disgruntledd: Oh 100%
[4:44:32] KnsWoW: ITS THE SAME... LUL
[4:44:40] Gingerprimer: @its_Xeph 25th oct according to the leak
[4:44:42] Broomba: omg people lol
[4:45:13] aceventus: I think they mean it is cheaper as in you do not have to buy an expansion to play. Just the sub

[4:45:52] Broomba: lol people play the game regardless if its retail or classic!!!!

[4:47:09] Armdel: just queue up in the dungeon finder 4Head

[4:47:16] Austei: the spirit of classic!
[4:47:43] Shurn_82: haha can't kill what isnt already dead
[4:47:48] Shurn_82: OHH SHITTTT I SAID IT\
[4:48:00] Austei: power gaming and then no one groups
[4:48:06] TheUnknowing: Ill be honest, ive hardly communicated with any one in classic outside of the occasional group to do an elite quest. SPIRIT OF CLASSIC
[4:48:08] xmirrxrs: Sounds like Retail LFG lol
[4:48:20] mintcookie_vajankle: Why didnt they put RDF in when there was so much pushback im confused
[4:48:20] gimarok44: little early for a shot but aight

[4:49:41] Gingerprimer: @MilesKG21 the true spirit of Classic :)
[4:49:49] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee it also let you spam heroics infinitely, which was nice.
[4:49:50] Broomba: there needs to be a wow addons: to create a wow character CV of your specs, gear, level, talents, etc @towelliee

[4:51:58] house573: @Mecabeast you should be able tolevel an alt to lvl 5 and be able to DE everything
[4:52:05] jkitchin75: try classic thay said fun thay said but no lfd oh hell no
[4:52:12] Zucchey: @Laelas_sm for sure
[4:52:27] Spykex02: I‚Äôve been loving prot warrior. Revenge has been so funny.
[4:53:18] Mecabeast: @hemzi84 did they change it in wrath classic? tbc classic required atleast 300 enchanting to de tbc greens so was expecting needing 350 enchanting for wrath greens
[4:54:11] stinkyspacenutz: thats the problem with ppl who rush to 80 they sit here with no one to do content with
[4:54:11] NBK_Sethus: healing is a horrible job in pugs, you're fixing everyone else's mistakes
[4:54:44] Recording_on_the_grass: so true

[4:55:57] hammack52: my excuse for not healing is that IT IS SO FUCKING BORING
[4:55:59] Hybridsteve: @Coffins85 thats why they need to have a dps spec to level with, then at 80 swithc to healing

[4:58:36] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee I'll always say it, Jay was right with what he said. But he was wrong with *how* he said it. Telling people "you don't want that" in that condescending tone, straight up made people think they did want this shit, just to spite him.
[4:58:42] Lostdogal: what's a good healing spec in wrath?
[4:59:01] Tiamarilien: I like healing, but I got distracted and didn't finish leveling, lol

[5:36:05] fewyn: it shouldn't be though
[5:36:07] SmackemJack: very legal nothing bad about the tackle
[5:36:07] brimes: I feel
[5:36:07] SonofHorus82: no he was a good hit. just an unfortunate landing.
[5:36:12] SLoPPYALieN: Red card
[5:36:15] Hollywood78: he just got smashed by a big dude...
[5:36:17] GODZILR1: was just a spin take donw,
[5:36:32] Durithane: but he's not Tom
[5:36:32] roeddogg: that was a penalty last season
[5:36:43] tycanada7: @Towelliee can you do the inquaboom still?
[5:36:49] firehawk73: He's small, like Baker
[5:36:50] Hollywood78: Tua is pretty small though isn't he?
[5:36:53] SimplyRed: I agreee 100%
[5:36:53] SmackemJack: That falls more on miami than the bengals
[5:36:56] SLoPPYALieN: That is always a foul when the Lion's do it
[5:36:58] phairis127: he shouldn't have been playing after getting messed up last week

[5:38:03] ErkTheMighty: the bengals have had some dirty hits in the past, but I didn't see anything wrong with the sack last night
[5:38:05] Holysal: @dschmidt yep
[5:38:22] Buckwink: Tua is a small guy too
[5:38:24] ClapMyCheeksPlss: DreamsDK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Morning! Happy Friday
[5:38:25] BMagicTX: im on of the best tree healers =P too bad were not on same server
[5:38:26] Jango_: @ErkTheMighty the dude flung him down after he was already sacked
[5:38:31] ErkTheMighty: Fel bad for Tua though, bad management might cost him his career
[5:38:38] SmackemJack: @Jango_ Burfict cost his team an AFC championship run though and was a dirty hit
[5:38:46] vtech310: if i heal would you pay for my duel spec?

[5:39:05] BMagicTX: lol
[5:39:09] Wcvechten: But towelliee, if you do that, it would ruin the immersion of standing afk in cities!
[5:39:10] Nehcrom: I detect a hint of sarcasm?
[5:39:10] Austei: it will ruin the spirit of classic!
[5:39:10] Skittlebeast: LUL LUL LUL
[5:39:11] ArcaneMaki: Someday
[5:39:13] firehawk73: small indie company
[5:39:13] ArcaneSyntax: wouldn't it be cool if you could group with people who aren't on your server?
[5:39:14] Alienfromger: some groupfinder? :O
[5:39:16] MILESkg21: the tech is YEARS AWAY
[5:39:16] Shrandamar: sounds like it would be hard to implement Kappa
[5:39:17] MrSupernoodles: KEKW
[5:39:19] Jango_: i hope they never add it after all of the complaining ive heard :P
[5:39:23] sycnessx: maybe that could be a new feature for a future version

[5:39:34] haxzerwow24: @Towelliee you think blizz is releasing DF to early?
[5:39:35] SimplyRed: hmm i got it, just let another mmo put it in their game 1st THEn wow can take it
[5:39:51] z3rodown: It really alienates people who'd like to silently just run dungeons. Some people don't want that much social interaction.
[5:40:06] Jbonn386: Yeah but think about it what if 5% of the time i get stuck with someone new, Gross

[5:40:12] dschmidt: @Towelliee that sounds like crazy future magic, and removes "immersion" and social interaction
[5:40:19] Darthyrevan: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:40:19] SlashSlashy: "we'll just give them more loot bags to entice them to tank/heal"

[5:40:38] z3rodown: @z3rodown Why do they have to pigeonholed to retail?
[5:40:39] im_n0t_jezus: NO wai
[5:40:40] MILESkg21: dont give them ideas towCopium
[5:40:41] fewyn: THAT SOUNDS INSANE

[5:40:51] WhatAboutBob71: Thats Witchcraft! LUL
[5:40:51] SmackemJack: this guy must be nuts talking about something so freaking advanced. Silly Streamer.
[5:40:51] Skittlebeast: classic Andys are totally against that
[5:40:51] GODZILR1: wait wqait wiat...what happens whent he dungeon is over?!?!
[5:40:58] REALPolarbeezy: They will do it when everyone leaves and they need people to stay
[5:41:00] Jbonn386: Yeah but think about it what if 5% of the time i get stuck with someone new, Gross @Towelliee
[5:41:01] HonestPhilosophy: They just didnt want to spend time on it
[5:41:02] supersmak: ...lock this guy up...that's insanity
[5:41:10] theSalute: wizardry I tell you
[5:41:12] Wulfgrym: imagine how stupid it would be to have a Q finder in a game where you have to play with other people
[5:41:14] DrainBramage777: what about, when most other people hit max level, that dont play WoW for al iiving, there will be healers :)
[5:41:25] z3rodown: Almost every interaction I have is saying "Hey. Summon please." and then the dungeon is over.
[5:41:27] audrock7: Honestly fkn ridiculous they removed dungy finder.
[5:41:35] Skittlebeast: NOVEMBER 28
[5:41:42] Rastailian: Stop it! it's already dead!
[5:41:54] CodyKane: This why you need to come to Mankrik so i can heal you again
[5:41:55] Shurn_82: @Towelliee all i can say is  'You think you do, but you don't"
[5:41:57] dschmidt: That would just make it easier for retail players to come in and beat classic andy's to WF's
[5:41:57] rdm88: Group finder is the tits.  Fuck the whole travelling bullshit. Classic was trash for that, having to travel 15 mins to dungeons was lame
[5:42:02] Masqerader: Blizzard seems to forget people are gonna play with friends anyway
[5:42:15] Frenaris: whattup hammer squad
[5:42:22] Croxssis: "because youn dont talk to them to form the group"
[5:42:25] Nehcrom: You think you do but you dont!
[5:42:44] SmackemJack: @dschmidt you mean the second world first all over again? i mean its been done already. so that shouldnt factor in honestly
[5:42:45] Twiello: now u make a grp and u dont talk to em either XD
[5:42:53] Norbi33: @Towelliee yoo can you check how much gold a quest give at this max lvl?
[5:43:08] Holysal: the game is classic is as social as retail. just dont tell the classic andys
[5:43:08] Shurn_82: @Nehcrom kinda funny because he talks about 'remember how you had to spam to find a tnak, you dont because you click a button"
[5:43:25] Shurn_82: thats jallenbrak comment is soo good for the talk now about RDF haha
[5:43:28] Nehcrom: @Nehcrom Hehe yeah I am aware :)
[5:43:37] dschmidt: @SmackemJack lmao - yes. I'm just piling onto all the "WF" drama right now.
[5:43:39] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Josh Strife Hayes put it best: You were social in older MMO's because that was your main way of socializing online. Nowadays with Twitter/IG/FB/Reddit, people don't feel the need to be social in video games anymore.
[5:43:48] SimplyRed: back in the day, my friend and i made a group of pallys, to fill all roles and would just que up in lfg to the point people loved getting us in groups lol.
[5:44:00] Nehcrom: @LtDanAndHisMagicLegs Totally agree it was novel back then.
[5:44:02] SmackemJack: @dschmidt well played lol
[5:44:08] Norbi33: from 12:02 PM im waiting for que.. 23 ppl front of me its 18:18 PM.. -,-
[5:44:15] r0b928: Hey towelliee did you put any more thought into doing a giveaway for your lego millennium falcon during the marathon as a sub goal?

[5:45:22] ivsaken: they are scared, have you seen the debate in forums over rdf?

[5:45:31] Glisur85: You think you do but you dont
[5:45:39] vtech310: all the people who said they didnt want it also voted for grimrail and didnt play
[5:45:41] Nehcrom: People that have access to DF beta, how likely do you think it will be released at set date? Got a couple of friends that already applied for vacation... I am a bit hesitant though.
[5:45:47] HonestPhilosophy: Everyone is leaving when DF comes out why spend the time
[5:45:48] ivsaken: not according to forums
[5:45:57] Wulfgrym: they don't want it till they can't find a healer for a week

[5:48:23] ParzTV81: you literally had to walk to everything
[5:48:52] ivsaken: you could not walk through a zone without a full group in ff11
[5:49:11] ParzTV81: i mean the game was still fun but yeah it didnt have a dungeon finder

[6:53:20] mintcookie_vajankle: How much for that rig?
[6:53:23] Eshel: @kellytm4   No but origin is already gonna outperform a lot of pc‚Äôs and that paint job is enough to throw it over the top

[6:55:24] Coffins85: If you can get a free PC from a Vendor then it doesnt matter who makes it.  But if you are spending your own money I would not buy from Origin/EA ever.  Have you seen how badly their games perform for Online pay from their servers.  Those people know nothing about hardware.

[7:18:05] spiked16: @Towelliee did they say what prepatch will involve ?? besides the 50% buff and evoker
[7:18:52] freefella: Try questing as a healer
[7:18:53] Sooba_: nah.. most won't know what Questie is and won't be able to quest at all.
[7:19:01] chrslp: Ive been loving semi-casual leveling in wrath so far
[7:19:04] chrslp: About to hit 75
[7:19:06] freefella: Then ucan talk
[7:19:24] Aidler: don‚Äôt know. I can currently make 1 level in 2 days

[7:19:52] ArcaneSyntax: the UI is different but the professions in SL are the same
[7:19:56] TheGiant99: Profession UI is on PTR
[7:20:20] Skittlebeast: prepatch is on PTR currently, there's no evoker.  Pretty sure that means you won't get evoker til nov
[7:20:36] TheGiant99: oh yea right

[7:22:24] KronasKG: I was lte to classic Vanilla and stoped because there was no dungeons happening while leveling...
[7:22:30] CrissJohnson: are there gonna be realms that start fresh with lvl 1 characters only?
[7:22:38] Skittlebeast: @fewyn I wonder what they mean by "at some point".. but that's cool then
[7:22:43] Daganatv: I'm excited to try Evoker during the prepatch
[7:22:49] AllenzoTV: @CrissJohnson we recently had new realms, like a few weeks ago

[7:23:41] Epiclurker27893: I remember leveling my hunter in wrath, I stayed in que the entire time and ran 3 dungeons. Not 3 dungeons over and over, just 3 dungeons.
[7:24:00] TheFuriyon: cata prepatch?
[7:24:01] TheUnknowing: think it was cata
[7:24:10] Treokosho: RDF was all dungeons at end of wrath

[7:29:30] TheFuriyon: FFXIV, OSRS, SWTOR, ESO
[7:29:31] AllenzoTV: LULW
[7:29:50] BrewCityMonk: top 3 if you was born yesterday
[7:29:52] NBK_Sethus: if they re-release vanilla it will be 3/4
[7:30:11] TheGiant99: SL was a shit showe
[7:30:13] AllenzoTV: Im sure they will re release classic eventually
[7:30:26] fewyn: classic plus
[7:30:33] NBK_Sethus: yeah but I mean full fresh classic, there's a demand
[7:30:37] AssaultF4: i mean i love the wow token aspect of game but if they remove subscription fee the game would be so big again

[7:31:12] Varaldus: Classic swtor, sign me up
[7:31:13] TheFuriyon: Oh so the SWTOR version that had no endgame?
[7:31:15] AllenzoTV: Id be down for that too
[7:31:16] TheGiant99: I loved questing to SWOTOR
[7:31:21] davidnewski: Draenor KEKW
[7:31:26] SonofHorus82: I'm probably the only one here that cares, but Lord of the Rings online announced a new xpac and graphic update.
[7:31:27] MXicanTroll: True, loved the story quest
[7:31:37] NBK_Sethus: SOM did because it came too soon after classic and it had too many changes, we need a fresh pure classic @Gingerprimer
[7:31:51] AllenzoTV: any game with voice acting + dialog choices gets me bricked
[7:31:55] Uncivilwar: lmao the druid running in circles
[7:32:18] duhworks: wow may die if they remove the sub
[7:32:20] AllenzoTV: no1 cares about paying for wow, tons of people pay multiple subs
[7:32:22] MXicanTroll: It aint big ass but never was less than big
[7:32:23] SLoPPYALieN: @Uncivilwar That's how you boost the HPS
[7:32:31] wetttnine: It‚Äôs 50 cents a day if you think about it
[7:32:42] dschmidt: @AssaultF4 look at the people that complain about store mounts etc now. If they removed the sub they would have to super charge monetization
[7:32:52] shepperd19: the sub is fine dont change it, it'll add consequences for the game
[7:33:02] Envoy04: the day they remove the sub is the day wow goes downhill quick
[7:33:04] BrewCityMonk: Dude you're in denial.
[7:33:19] BrewCityMonk: That's FFXIV not WoW! LUL
[7:33:27] shepperd19: nobody here wants a wow battlepass or additional micros
[7:33:36] MoonwalkingAngel79: ff11 stil sub expacs and going
[7:33:46] ScalarGaming: exactly @shepperd19
[7:34:02] DragonofWolves: tbh FF14 is as successful as WoW has so either game will move to F2P anytime soon.
[7:34:04] BrewCityMonk: WoW is a MMO that's using a core engine that's so outdated that it's meant to only run on Win XP! LUL
[7:34:18] kokochris: yup
[7:34:23] Sooba_: I do think wow should be cheaper though
[7:34:26] Jakosin: Get your murloc costume from the this amazing battle pass!
[7:34:26] shepperd19: thats whats happens when a game goes f2p
[7:34:26] AllenzoTV: I'd be eveling 5 toons at once

[7:34:31] Merzerker: imagine f2p botting

[7:35:21] TheGiant99: Look at all the Bots in Lost Ark next time you want wow to be F2P
[7:35:32] chrslp: WoW is one of those games that runs great on shitty PCs and can also look amazing on decent PCs. No high end PC needed

[7:36:20] Sooba_: there are featuree of unreal blizz should develope inhouse though
[7:36:24] enux337: 2077
[7:36:24] mintcookie_vajankle: Dude if WoW had 2022 graphics I would cry as my CPU combusts
[7:36:24] uglla3np: preach it
[7:36:29] ScalarGaming: WTB ashes of creation GAMEPLAY!
[7:36:33] Angistar: need to be able to play wow with my VR headset jboSnort

[7:36:49] chrslp: I have a shitty 7 year old PC with a 1050Ti and I can run WoW at max settings and still get >100 fps
[7:36:55] chrslp: Find another game that can do that
[7:36:56] veroggo99: wow graphics just fine the way it is :D

[7:37:28] Holysal: @ScalarGaming im a time traveler that came from 2036 and it still didnt release
[7:37:28] BrewCityMonk: @BrewCityMonk Getting a better PC doesn't fix what wrong with WoW. It will still look like a outdated game! LUL
[7:37:37] hammack52: wow looks the way it doesd so that people can run it on crapy pc because unlike what the people think of just get a better pc is that not everyone have disposible income to just upgrade when ever they want
[7:37:42] abracka_: healers getting their payment
[7:37:43] chrslp: @Rubbley Ok lemme be specific. Find me a game with similar graphics. Not potato graphics LUL

[7:38:30] Masqerader: ya when Rohan is
[7:38:31] Masqerader: should be one
[7:38:32] kokochris: yup that is possible
[7:38:34] dschmidt: @BrewCityMonk this is WoW's aesthetic, its not meant to be hyper realistic. This is a weird take.
[7:38:34] veroggo99: true
[7:38:56] Creative_Pigeon: its like bethesda building a new engine for skyrim and another new engine for ES6

[7:39:52] BrewCityMonk: @AllenzoTV These are the same people that are on hard copium bro! LUL
[7:40:07] DragonofWolves: WoW wouldn;t look good in Unreal Engine. The game was never meant to be that realistic.

[7:42:58] DragonofWolves: The good thing about WoW is that it's CPU intensive, and you don't really need that strong of a PC to run it. Just have a half decent pc and you're good to go.
[7:43:30] abracka_: yeah
[7:43:35] Jakosin: I have screen shots of back in BC with sub 30 fps raiding black temple lol

[8:25:15] gurnt4: i had that done to me. about 3 or 4 inches on each shoulder were outside of the machine when they tried to put me in. they told me to just try and pull my shoulders in
[8:25:16] Cello_73: thats not bad at all
[8:25:21] 91Niki: @smashwow Damn you read my mind!!
[8:25:28] ArcaneMaki: ear plugs?

[9:38:41] theDirtyon3: many whelps fight?
[9:39:16] Daarksyde: looks like braking the eggs early spawns a smaller add. letting it hatch, makes a big one
[9:39:36] Daarksyde: so needs people with speed abilities pick sides of the floor to break eggs
[9:39:38] ijuki: @Holysal So it seems so on this boss fight

[9:46:43] Kneckt: @Alaquane deff an ADVANCED class lol
[9:46:55] Holysal: @Alaquane it is a ADVANCED class LUL
[9:47:45] TheItalianStallion321: in my pug group, we sat there almost 10 minutes and we havent pulled the boss once lol. no one is talking, tanks are sleeping. this is great beta testing.
[9:48:09] Holysal: the worst thing about the channeling spells. is when they move halfway done lol
[9:48:24] dschmidt: looks like you need to move the boss away from the staff
[9:48:48] Daarksyde: are people just using the starter gear when character is created or doing the crafted or pvp gear?

[9:51:38] Daarksyde: def a ADVgg focus fight for tanks lol
[9:51:56] TheItalianStallion321: as an evoker, i was sustaining like 35k hps in the 1 pull we had lol theres a TON of dmg in this fight
[9:53:09] Dkgungo: this is why i dont like raiding in modern wow every fight has to have a million things going on at once

[9:53:57] Shubwub: Fights tested last night had like 3 mechanics each, let's not act like it's every fight
[9:54:01] Holysal: @TheItalianStallion321 do you even notice the 5 yards buff?
[9:55:10] TheItalianStallion321: @TheItalianStallion321 honestly, not really. i try to stay in-between everyone but again, this is a pug, morons are 90 yards away regardless
[9:55:14] Daarksyde: maybe she picks specific colored eggs per hatch?
[9:55:27] Holysal: @TheItalianStallion321 yeah
[9:55:54] TheItalianStallion321: i do think once you get used to it, it wont be so bad. @Holysal
[9:56:03] kingg3d: so many classes with their color being green
[9:56:38] Holysal: @TheItalianStallion321 just need to learn how to use the movement since they are very mobile
[9:58:52] Alaquane: wonder if you can position her so she only hatches 1 yellow egg at a time
[9:58:57] TheItalianStallion321: i will say using hover and casting while moving is really really nice @Holysal
