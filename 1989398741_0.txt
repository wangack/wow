[1:22:52] Niksen_99: BM hunters already got nerfed right ? Or fixed
[1:23:20] ronny_84: BM should be nerfed.. for a spec soo simplistic it shoulldnt be top damage .. its a easy entry level spec
[1:23:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[1:23:25] Infebdo: @Niksen_99 ended up being a buff above 450ilvl
[1:23:35] Niksen_99: Oh damn
[1:25:21] Squats3: @biggyronny what a take
[1:25:32] asmodai4823: hes right tho
[1:25:44] Squats3: hes not tho
[1:25:56] LuiBMHunter: Hunters have a really complicated rotation!
[1:26:02] akia03: isnt every spec easy to play now
[1:26:05] ronny_84: @Squats3 its true lol.. being in the middle is more than fine and im saying this has a hunter player.
[1:26:09] asmodai4823: bruh BM can move and do full dps at range
[1:26:16] asmodai4823: its the easiest spec in the game by far
[1:26:18] NickLeonhearth: maybe battle shout would help time the key :D
[1:26:23] Rudric_Ice: hunters are easy tf u talkin about
[1:26:50] flookguy: prot warrior is a sleeper bro my buddy did 176k overall last night on a 22AD
[1:26:53] Squats3: every class is easy to play now - your perceived difficulty of the class shouldnt determine how good they are. they should all just be good
[1:27:20] asmodai4823: @Squats3 you are hard coping
[1:27:26] Rudric_Ice: wrong not every class is easy to play optimally
[1:27:42] Brodih_: why is the Evoker dps always so low on the meters?
[1:27:49] Infebdo: @Brodih_ augmentation
[1:27:52] asmodai4823: BM doesnt have to thing about uptime at all. It just jumps around like a spaz doing full dps
[1:27:58] asmodai4823: quit coping
[1:28:02] asmodai4823: think*
[1:28:03] Soerevik: @Squats3 go watch a real Arcane mage guide and tell me again that every class is easy

[1:28:44] Squats3: @Squats3 arcane mage is legit the only spec that has any difficulty at all.

[2:06:41] 91Niki: It's better than Crystal Skull, but it still isn't coming close to the old ones
[2:07:16] dirtydeus: fort bolstering inc
[2:08:03] NickLeonhearth: @91Niki I'd say Crystal Skull is better :D didn't like this one at all
[2:08:27] kimmo_gaming: spiteful
[2:08:39] jarilrpg: fort, volcanic, and spiteful
[2:09:13] fistofnature: fort with spiteful is really annoying
[2:09:30] mooseon: whats your least liked dungeon is dragonflight and for all xpacs
[2:09:35] 91Niki: @NickLeonhearth I personally think Dial of Destiny came a little closer to what the original 3 was, where Crystal Skull was further from that. Kinda what I am basing them on. I still think they should have just kept it at the original 3 and called it a day :p But you know disney and money
[2:09:48] Lloydbanksz: u take no damage with bear interesting

[2:10:45] yadungoofed101: i dont think its quite as bad as everyone making it out to be
[2:11:17] NickLeonhearth: @91Niki oh yea definitely they should have left it at the OG 3, trying to figure out of crystal skull is better or dial of destiny...well they are both poop compared the the OG 3, or even as a movie on their own
[2:11:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mitigation depends a bit on the build, I like the Ursoc's Fury talent for the added damage shields
[2:11:35] 91Niki: @NickLeonhearth Yeah for sure
[2:11:43] nevercluckyy: if you arent pushing like....20+ just play what you find fun if you dont have a good healer in group its not going to matter anyways

[2:28:29] Ardailec: "We would rather you not play Assassin Rogue"
[2:28:34] Scarhearth: I rather them not nerf any of them and buff the underperformers
[2:28:44] EnragedSushi: I hate that.  My girl is a main DH and she had been enjoying herself lol
[2:28:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frost DK needed buffed
[2:29:13] Forteskir: @Towelliee Do you know if the legendary axe will also drop on LFR?
[2:29:34] VinnyDaPoooh: im getting a 3% buff yay
[2:29:42] Pharaoh_326: thats just a nerph to the last raid tier set for DK
[2:29:44] Qufios: The changes coming mention nothing about DH in PvE content though?
[2:29:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadow priest did need it too
[2:29:52] VinnyDaPoooh: shoulda gave me 3% dmg too why not
[2:30:14] Robodope: pls no mw nerfs pls no mw nerfs pls no mw nerfs
[2:30:19] SpoofAvatar: shadowpriest, affliction and desto locks will be middle of pack again instead of on the bottom
[2:30:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Havoc in PvP is going to get hammered just because of the data
[2:30:34] Caedranos: DH will get mega nerfed
[2:30:43] Pharaoh_326: Buff WW Monk or i riot!!!
[2:30:49] yadungoofed101: eh, it's last tier, let people cook
[2:31:01] ArcaneSyntax: I really hope they don't tune the strength classes around the legendary.
[2:31:02] OwndOwndOwnd: haha true
[2:31:04] Scarhearth: Ive been playing frost dk occasionally in keys its problem is purely tanks moving out of your DnD and ST being kinda meh
[2:31:09] Adraythien: fun detected? SeriousSloth
[2:31:10] EnragedSushi: Think DH tank will still be cool or?
[2:31:11] JLM23: WW is fine doesn't need buffs
[2:31:18] Robodope: yea they detected mistweaver was being brought to RWF and called in the nerf monk seal team six
[2:31:24] tlsmith3638: this is ghostcrawler to paladins "to the ground "  level event?
[2:31:32] ElmSpace: more aug changes?
[2:31:35] OwndOwndOwnd: i hope they delete demon hunters
[2:31:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know that we will see any changes for Vengeance DH, even though it probably is the strongest one
[2:31:53] EnragedSushi: It's not
[2:32:02] Scarhearth: The biggest change they could do to WW monk is delete the spec Kappa
[2:32:06] laaxxxd: Remove  AUG then they dont need to nerf  classes
[2:32:11] thiccsushi: Isn't aug like super bugged right now?
[2:32:16] RoarinShots: you gotta love flavor of the month people
[2:32:23] lumaday: @laaxxxd amen
[2:32:23] hammanu33: Wait, bear was so broken last season and they did nothing. But, some specs are near that level this season and the hammer falls.
[2:32:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: WW monk needs some kind of help, I think
[2:32:29] K_Nun: Fun classes get nerfed. boring classes get buffed... classic
[2:32:34] OwndOwndOwnd: rets are good
[2:32:39] ArcaneSyntax: Ret paladins crank in aoe
[2:32:43] OhNoNotAgain: <- is a ret paladin that has all keys at 20 or higher in pugs
[2:32:44] EnragedSushi: @laaxxxd I think this is what we're missing here.  If AUG didn't exist we wouldnt be having this drastic tweaks needed
[2:32:52] yadungoofed101: ret already pumps and gonna be even more w the leggo
[2:32:55] lumaday: ret utility is so good
[2:32:57] NobodybetterPat: mornin folks

[2:33:16] OnePlayerPete: <- Ret Enjoyer
[2:33:20] JLM23: Other than that ouch
[2:33:20] ArcaneSyntax: I think ret does maybe need a st buff, something minor like 3-5%
[2:33:22] RestingDaffodil: ret literally #1 dps on his recount dmg
[2:33:44] sotsil_: can confirm
[2:33:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: LFR LUL

[2:34:23] pruteee: 2min cd your 25% useful
[2:34:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: half of the people on that LFR  recount probably died
[2:34:24] Solarwings: carry in Atal is yuck
[2:34:45] VinnyDaPoooh: atal 17... on tyranical.. after they buffed yazma... on a caster... id rather die
[2:34:56] Scarhearth: Ret pallies are great.  Bad players however are not great
[2:35:23] opalwinfrey: I got accepted into the WoW variety show for their Season of Discovery BFD raid race
[2:35:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard Max talk about Ret last night, he said it's good it's just not cracked out

[3:28:51] Karmaz515: the fire doesn't hurt the boss too? lol
[3:28:51] realnzall: @Towelliee Wasn't that the strategy for the Ascendant Council achievement?
[3:28:57] Wornsy: If it's a frost boss
[3:28:58] Caedranos: They queue up tank for fast queue Kappa

[3:41:32] D3mitr1: Vaults today gonna be juicy I can feel it
[3:41:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: They did increase the price on Turbo a bit, but it's still worth it if you watch more than 2 streamers regularly
[3:41:44] TheEddieG: oh yea new lfr bosses
[3:41:57] Brodih_: what do kids watch on twtich, xqc and the OTK people?
[3:41:59] Amarlian: Two weeks for next LFR boss @Towelliee

[3:42:31] TheEddieG: what is catalyst because I don't have tier
[3:42:34] TheCliffyShow: I'm sitting on 3 pieces of tier already.
[3:42:34] mavericks312: if the vault is good to me I could possibly have 4pc
[3:42:42] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Same HYPERS
[3:42:45] ZeusDNA: I've yet to get a tier drop from a boss yet this patch ahah
[3:42:47] PigPenLen: wassup all towHi towGift towLfg
[3:42:48] StateFarm206: i have 4pc right now as a healer so i love it
[3:42:49] Pimento: Ha you're hilarious thinking that tier exists for everyone
[3:42:50] smashwow: LUL you say that... we've still got people in raid that don't have 4p
[3:42:51] MattyjTV: i havnt even used my first catalyst, im waiting til i at least get my first piece of tier before i burn it
[3:43:00] thischatis: Hunter
[3:43:06] shale93: yeah I have 4 set on 2 chars

[3:45:30] smashwow: normal/heroic you just fuck off away from people
[3:45:57] Thee_Phantom_Spider: is this boss a hydra or just a lava snake ?
[3:46:10] Amarlian: @TheEddieG Season 2 Gear conversion is still available to use and it no longer uses a token. You can just take dreamsurge gear and convert that to S2. Otherwise, S3 is one token every two weeks. Second token for S3 is after reset today
[3:46:23] shale93: lava snek
[3:46:54] TheEddieG: @Amarlian oh shit I'm going to have three pieces, maybe four if my vault is good
[3:47:06] TheEddieG: my guild didn't tell me and I'm a lazy player this is excellent news
[3:47:09] mitzdudez: interested to hear your thoughts on the RWF. do you think Method are getting alot of disprespect? Sco has managed to rebuild the guild, after 99% of the playerbase left and formed Echo. and he has managed to atleast keep method in the top 3. But it seems like they get alot of disprect for no reason.
[3:47:29] yooyoo1337: those pets dont give a damn about the lava
[3:48:08] Amarlian: @TheEddieG ha! I am a pure LFR hero since I have other life responsibilities. So the Catalyst is so nice

[3:49:11] Heero_Effect: method had gotten better ever tier it seems. Echo and liquid were playing out of there minds though

[3:49:49] mmrghost7: whats the best way to find a mythic guild these days ?
[3:49:52] Scorpio1401: Damn, 2 more months till 12 years PogChamp
[3:50:00] mavros_kyrios: Coffee w/Towelliee ... a good thing
[3:50:20] ThrottleJunkie: so who won rwf?
[3:50:29] yooyoo1337: echo
[3:50:34] TheUnknowing: Max talked about it a bit, he seems to think that they would need to learn to strategize themselves and such
[3:50:34] mavericks312: max said last night your either number 1 or you failed
[3:50:36] Denhuuf: Echo won
[3:50:36] kingcamps_alot: echo
[3:50:47] ZeusDNA: @mmrghost7 Probably raider io and search for guilds recruiting. Look at the guilds on your servers progress in each raid tier and find ones that have killed mythic bosses and reach out to their guild leader.
[3:50:51] EpicJune: take drugs kappa
[3:50:53] ThrottleJunkie: Is echo the euro squad?
[3:50:54] ashwing_: Get better players
[3:51:08] Schlafiyo: when is NA reset ? 30min ? @chat
[3:51:12] kingcamps_alot: do what echo did
[3:51:17] Denhuuf: yes echo is europe
[3:51:23] Aquadriel: Get a larger community that can carry you through as many splits KEKW
[3:51:24] Crafty_plays: @ThrottleJunkie technically but both of the top 2 guilds are mixed NA and EU
[3:51:26] ashwing_: Better analysts better WA builders etc
[3:51:31] tszord: Eat more tacos
[3:51:36] Bowwjack: @Towelliee take your tallents to South Beach xD
[3:51:44] Brodih_: im pretty sure that most of Methods players would  leave for Echo if they had a chance
[3:51:46] ashwing_: @Aquadriel Method were higher itlvl than Echo and Liquid what are you saying
[3:51:59] kingcamps_alot: @tszord  gets it
[3:52:03] ThrottleJunkie: @Crafty_plays k thanks.. been so long out of the game, know little of the current top tier raiders
[3:52:25] CeruleanStar: looked like just more pulls to me - method was very far behind in pull count were they not ?
[3:52:27] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[3:52:35] mitzdudez: it just seems that Method had to rebuild from scratch. and the only original players that remained was SCO. So for them to get top 3 consistently is pretey good achievment. They even got world 2ns in Sepulchar.
[3:52:37] grizzlytag: have you ever been approached by any of the top tier raiding guilds? like ever have the opportunity to be a part of RWF
[3:53:19] Masqerader: mechanics PepeClap
[3:53:19] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:53:57] MKBragg: Max said Methods biggest problem is that they don't have front runner experience like they used to, so coming up with their own strats is no longer a skill they have and is something they need to redevelop if they want to truly compete for world first
[3:54:08] Crafty_plays: @mitzdudez because liquid quit lol
[3:54:22] Maydie6066: Towelliee could be the father of 1/2 the RWF teams
[3:54:28] Masqerader: garf monster
[3:54:29] Colt_Engineer: Nah you’re young at heart
[3:54:32] mitzdudez: well if they quit they quit. nobody told them to quit
[3:54:35] Eregbueye: garry squater
[3:54:42] mitzdudez: so Method took world 2nd
[3:54:57] Masqerader: u mean 3rd?
[3:55:00] Masqerader: liquid has 2nd
[3:55:02] ashwing_: @Crafty_plays and does that make their 2nd irrelevant that liquid did not have the stamina to keep going?
[3:55:14] mitzdudez: im talking about Speulchar
[3:55:42] ThrottleJunkie: I think you could be a top tier raider towelliee. Your knowledge of the game alone is a HUGE asset. So what if the hair is getting a little grey.
[3:55:45] Brodih_: I love Souls like, but I feel that with age, I no longer have the patiences to grind bosses
[3:55:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: They usually need split helpers
[3:55:55] khrovaa: that would be cool
[3:56:04] Crafty_plays: @Crafty_plays irrelevant? Of course not. Meaningless in the grand scheme of things knowing what we all know about RWF. Pretty much. As Max said, if you aren't first, you failed so it doesn't really matter
[3:56:05] DunzoCD: the m+ tank too
[3:56:16] khrovaa: liquid splits are how i get my easy AOTC done @Towelliee
[3:56:26] xvstormvx: xvstormvx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[3:57:14] Masqerader: the boss is very killable
[3:57:16] PigPenLen: age doesn’t matter in gaming, we’ve all been degens at some point and can turn it back on. lol am not as good as I once was…..
[3:57:17] ambiotic: I dont think they really need to nerf much until they see how gear goes
[3:57:18] im_n0t_jezus: this raid so easy on Normal
[3:57:27] Digidan2005: nerfs will probably be early january as a guess
[3:57:34] Brodih_: tank should move boss for melee
[3:57:35] D3mitr1: Would you call this the best raid for the last 2 expansions?
[3:57:37] duffluv22: With Warbands...can you get gear from one toon and give it to your mains? Just curious
[3:57:40] pbnj_kills: probably after they have top 20 guilds kill
[3:57:41] im_n0t_jezus: on H its fucking fun but still not hard
[3:57:42] ambiotic: not soaking
[3:57:45] smashwow: which boss is killable?
[3:57:51] mavericks312: yea max was saying blizz copped out with not having another raid
[3:57:56] Masqerader: no tier, just tears
[3:57:59] Eggz1004: hearthstone
[3:58:05] Ragnarage95: Isnt the helm enchant gonna make things a bit easier as well
[3:58:06] Brodih_: RIP

[3:59:11] ZealotryTV: ive done lfr on 5 diff toons the last 2 weeks and have 0 tier from it
[3:59:13] j_bar111: I lost a curio last week from fyrakk with a 99, someone rolled a 100
[3:59:13] Thee_Phantom_Spider: @thischatis rude
[3:59:16] Thee_Phantom_Spider: Modcheck
[3:59:17] devilhawk83: Blizzard think Towelliee got BiS on his Priest FailFish
[3:59:20] Templexx: loot banned
[3:59:21] jonnyblaze2006: Is it worse to roll a 5 or roll a 96 and lose to a 97?
[3:59:22] brentosxd: I don't get the point of group loot over personal loot in LFR
[3:59:23] 91Niki: KEKW
[3:59:25] marineboi1288: You gunna get the mount again on your EU account lmao
[3:59:27] Shiaco: I came back to retail for the first time since legion and on my server they have yet beat normal Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible or Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope
[3:59:29] beerking2323: lol
[3:59:31] icerasta: I havent rolled over a 43 on any of my characters in the last 2 weeks
[3:59:33] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[3:59:38] ElmSpace: personal loot being turned to group loot in LFR was the worst change
[3:59:39] AamiraCat: Blizzard's gift to all Spriests: nerfs and no loot lol
[3:59:43] mlewis4011: My LFR experience so far.... I think LFR should have personal loot
[3:59:45] pk99: TowLeak
[3:59:56] Amarlian: it's the best passive aggressive way to get back at you. "Make all his rolls low" - Ion
[3:59:59] shaemrokk: @mlewis4011 YES!
[4:00:08] Shiaco: lfr used to have personal loot
[4:00:36] Masqerader: @ElmSpace it literally changed nothing, instead of an internal roll u didn't see, u just see the roll, the result is the same, you either get loot or you don't
[4:00:37] beerking2323: at least Blizzard istn like Wizzards of the Coast. They send Private Investigators to rough you up and shit lol
[4:00:46] beerking2323: there is a story on it
[4:00:53] 88eg: agreed
[4:00:54] Eggz1004: 100%
[4:00:58] 91Niki: Agree
[4:01:01] 91Niki: It's dumb

Also rather than a roll to see if you get loot then a roll to see what you get,  group loot now gives several rolls against other players on loot that has dropped creating a more toxic environment.

[4:19:10] azirum: My guild gave me the Beacon first as an Arms Warrior. Wiped the raid the first time using it due to how much it ripped aggro.

[4:20:32] yadungoofed101: not personal loot it was on the loot table
[4:20:38] NobodybetterPat: @Alaquane you mean hunter weapon
[4:20:55] smashwow: if he got the drop the drop should be unlocked
[4:20:56] brewgamingtv: the first drop was on the loot table

[4:21:57] Nebulizer87: Superbloom was very underwhelming compared to their little video about lessons learned with open world events
[4:22:04] Xerevil: @Cypfer i meant the quest drop item not the axe itself.
[4:22:06] khrovaa: god superblooms are so boring

[4:37:19] Arkangel_I: raids have been very intuitive imo.
[4:37:23] mustiparta: it’s been great for getting friends to start playing finally
[4:37:24] j_bar111: This expansion has been great, i actually just want to play
[4:37:24] ArcaneSyntax: I got ksm for the first time this expansion
[4:37:28] ripshawda3rd: do you prefer that or would you want it harded
[4:37:30] khrovaa: the fact that i can pug AOTC 2nd week and run 21s without a guild at all is great
[4:37:34] 91Niki: I sometimes buy books on amazon, and sometimes its from sellers, not amazon. Those fuckers will ship book in a plastic bag. ZERO protection, and the book is all bent. Every time I contact amazon and just get my money back. Some people don't give two shits about proper shipping.
[4:37:34] UnearthedSin: Have never run a mythic, ever. One day. :D
[4:37:35] atsq1: I like it because I can do my two achievements and take a break (ksm and heroic raid)
[4:37:37] Dkgungo: next xpac gonna be even more casual friendly
[4:37:43] pbnj_kills: I kinda like it as casual but it makes me want to go back to mythic guilds since it's so short
[4:37:45] keyboardjesus123: it should be easier at the lower and mid levels. they tuned it perfectly
[4:37:47] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the 10.2 Raid Fights Overview | https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ47ecb6VwPnA53-5r0iEtP5lEyY0HE2m
[4:38:08] ripshawda3rd: i lioke that its hard
[4:38:11] j_bar111: The raid tuning was spot on for the race
[4:38:24] ripshawda3rd: i agree cus we shoudnt have gotten world 24th
[4:38:28] j_bar111: I think smolderon could have been a bit harder
[4:38:39] Heero_Effect: you gotta want it towKawaii
[4:38:55] smashwow: you think that until you do it on smolderon
[4:39:05] FlatulentBeaver: is the vault based on the content you did the previous week?
[4:39:18] smashwow: that boss isn't that easy. those guilds just make it look easy
[4:39:23] Submarine_Mike: @FumblesPE yes
[4:39:38] szeeman62: Gotta give echo credit their streaming the tear down of the rwf set and people are watching it lol
[4:39:44] im_n0t_jezus: nnice
[4:39:46] FlatulentBeaver: ty!
[4:39:47] ripshawda3rd: thats insane
[4:40:00] keyboardjesus123: your opinion is super valid, especially since this tier is supposed to last a very long time
[4:40:06] Thee_Phantom_Spider: what yummies did you just woof down @Towelliee LOL
[4:40:11] Thee_Phantom_Spider: that boy was HUNNNGRY
[4:40:17] keyboardjesus123: gonna be a huge content drought in like 1.5 months
[4:40:29] Thee_Phantom_Spider: scrambled?
[4:40:29] Alaquane: also thanks to Instant Dollars for killing those bosses early to lock in their difficulty
[4:40:32] ripshawda3rd: i thought they weer noodles
[4:40:32] toobaked1987: Why are DKs always cracked at the end of every expansion?
[4:40:40] Alaquane: blizzard didn't have time to knee jerk buff them
[4:40:40] src1923: new content is coming in a few weeks anyway
[4:41:16] j_bar111: Did you do 30man splits?

[4:44:13] Winduhh: @Sheckly84 The Axe dropped but it's not unlocked for the region until the quest is completed which takes a few days of grinding the 200x seed things
[4:44:14] Masqerader: ya, but tazavesh was fun
[4:44:14] atsq1: I think I’ll just gear my alts in s4

[4:44:32] thiccsushi: I'd love to raid nighthold again
[4:44:38] neftario105: !CHAIR

[4:46:54] Zavier420: Fuck SoO. That's a stupidly long raid
[4:46:55] thiccsushi: BfA base dungeons were better than shadowlands and dragonflight
[4:46:57] Robodope: just pick one fan favorite boss from the last 10 tiers and lump them into one mega raid. just portal us between boss rooms

[6:02:20] superpudd: You can all mount up and run at the same time to skip and then the rogue can distract him
[6:02:26] Vosy1984: mob did an eye exam after the last vault
[6:02:33] Polarisss_: You can skip him if you're fast enough but he does see stealth better to stealth the little globs

[8:26:41] Marz311: oled, each pixel emits light.... blacks the light is turned off so true black
[8:26:44] flookguy: oled watch out for burn in
[8:26:44] Sollice: grey to grey
[8:26:48] Treevinal: grey to grey
[8:26:50] MackPlays: good to go
[8:26:52] ArcaneMaki: good to go?

[8:27:06] Maydie6066: @Sollice nah its terrible, he should send it to me, ill suffer with it
[8:27:07] Wulfgrym: im also concerned about burn @flookguy
[8:27:14] beauds69: OLED monitors are known for their exceptional color accuracy and contrast, while LED monitors are praised for their energy efficiency and durability. On the other hand, IPS monitors stand out for their wide viewing angles and superior color consistency. google
[8:27:28] tonyr23: the price 😶
[8:27:32] Treevinal: touch on board display
[8:27:34] Zandia: @Towelliee  OSD= On Screen Display
[8:27:38] Sollice: @Towelliee Take it from me. This is going to look amazing and you will want 2 more
[8:27:44] N3llee: am i wrong or is that a gg fps monitor?
[8:27:46] Sollice: No
[8:27:53] ThePawPaw: KEKW
[8:27:53] Sollice: Its not a touch screen
[8:27:54] Sholmes2: yo that price is crazy y
[8:27:58] ArcaneMaki: Yeah you as a streamer, hopefully no burn-in with stream frame @Towelliee
[8:27:59] Sollice: They do
[8:28:00] flookguy: IPS for me. way more durable. oled burn in is a real problem
[8:28:10] ZeusDNA: I got a 45 inch OLED a couple weeks ago and it's been amazing playing games on it.
[8:28:18] Wulfgrym: @Sollice have you noticed any burn?
[8:28:21] Sollice: @flookguy OLD OLED has burn in. I have been using a 42 inch C2 as my main monitor for a year
[8:28:22] Marz311: most new oleds do pixel shifting to reduce burn in
[8:28:24] Sollice: Zero issues
[8:28:33] Sollice: @Towelliee Dont bother. You will not have burn in
[8:28:38] MackPlays: A burn in in 2023 lol ok
[8:28:45] Lostdogal: looks like a ghost of an image overlaid
[8:28:46] Bernardo994: its dead pixels
[8:28:59] ambiotic: ya
[8:29:05] MackPlays: It’s when you don’t have power saving mode or screensaver
[8:29:08] Celestia6: yuck
[8:29:14] Sollice: Its not dead pixels lol
[8:29:14] Se7enthSinn: that's not a thing anymore
[8:29:15] Lostdogal: easy to get rid of if it happens, just put a white screen on.
[8:29:15] Bernardo994: images get stuck
[8:29:16] flookguy: go to ultrawide Reddit page bro burn in is still very much a thing
[8:29:17] ThrottleJunkie: that is super bad burn in
[8:29:22] ZeusDNA: I shut my monitor off whenever I'm not actively on it lol
[8:29:25] ArcaneMaki: that frae
[8:29:27] knifeblind: @Towelliee  dont buy it yet, you wont feel a difference playing WOW.
[8:29:27] TheGiant99: I heard the newer ones dint have burnin issurs
[8:29:27] han_saro: A lot of the newer OLEDs have much less of an issue with burn in.
[8:29:29] Lostdogal: Cant see it happening on modern screens though
[8:29:31] ambiotic: 420 blaze it

[8:29:38] Bernardo994: derpy
[8:29:40] ZeusDNA: Is it him or the monitor that is burned in KEKW
[8:29:41] MackPlays: It never happens unless u leave ur pc on same screen for days
[8:29:43] Maxoru0: lol
[8:30:05] Sollice: @Towelliee No
[8:30:07] Sollice: Your fine
[8:30:11] ArcaneMaki: New OLED move pixels ever slightly so you don't get burn-in
[8:30:15] dimofodi: My brother turns off his OLED any time he steps away because he doesn't want to leave it on in case he's away longer than he expected to be and since it's so expensive he doesn't want to risk it.
[8:30:16] firehawk73: no
[8:30:17] MackPlays: No cus it’s moving the pixels are changing
[8:30:18] notColt45: Burn in is deff an older issue. It theoretically CAN happen but most likely won't
[8:30:21] MackPlays: It’s static images
[8:30:23] TheCountMST: Constant movement. Burn-in requires stationary picture
[8:30:24] Bezroth: Static images cause burn in
[8:30:25] spektyr25: h4x0r25 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[8:30:29] andre_scb: screensaver and problem is solved
[8:30:36] Sollice: Your going to want 2 more as soon as you get them :P
[8:30:37] Marz311: your phone display is oled if you have one lol
[8:30:39] Bernardo994: my onitor time out is they go back
[8:30:45] TacDuc: I got an OLED monitor here recently, and it is amazing. There is a risk of Burnin, but the people who tested it did like 6000 hours of so of straight CNN for burnin to happen
[8:30:50] Bernardo994: monitors*
[8:30:53] LegoCoin: yeah tweaking the colors are the biggest pain to get it right
[8:30:53] notColt45: gg
[8:30:59] Aromantis: nj
[8:31:02] LegoCoin: there are preconfigs on some sites that help alot
