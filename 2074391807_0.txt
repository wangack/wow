[1:14:45] buzja: o7

[1:15:27] urmadlife: automated bans are way too stupid
[1:15:31] fridxa: They are just crying wolf, they are all gold buyers
[1:15:34] Alis_yazuki: savix look at me and u we havent been banned and I move ALOT of gold trade inside gnomer too
[1:15:34] b00tstrap: crammer
[1:15:35] DankWizard420: I'd say half of them arent true but blizzard ARE incompetent so
[1:15:41] Madwo: buh
[1:15:43] brakealot: you know what else is a hard one @Savix ?
[1:15:44] HidekiKojima: @niveous_a wait did I? LULW
[1:15:44] brakealot: THIS
[1:15:45] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix a bit long but i think you should react this https://youtu.be/aB20PoitwXg?t=12
[1:15:45] b00tstrap: cray-mer
[1:15:46] brakealot: and
[1:15:47] brakealot: THESE
[1:15:47] voncline88: The reason this is a big deal is because Blizzard has denied any appeals on these things.  They ban people and then refuse to correct their mistakes.
[1:15:49] FelipeLLs: o7 savix band
[1:15:51] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix a bit long but i think you should react this https://youtu.be/aB20PoitwXg?t=12 󠀀
[1:15:52] niveous_a: @HidekiKojima oh i think it was tummy xuh
[1:15:53] emikochan13: i doubt it's automated bans, they just tracked the dirty gold
[1:15:53] RighteousBuddy: sexist phase KEKW
[1:15:55] Alis_yazuki: savix look at me and u we havent been banned and I move ALOT of gold trade inside gnomer too.  I think these ppl are gold buyers
[1:16:11] DankWizard420: blizzard didnt even include a pvp rank cloak that should be in KEKW
[1:16:13] bathroom64: pls add dual spec
[1:16:18] FelipeLLs: there is dummies in shimmering salts
[1:16:23] Qeevdo: @bathroom64 Prayge
[1:16:24] Jim_Tonic90: isn't there a dummy in shimmering flats now?
[1:16:24] emikochan13: you don't need a dummy, that's what dueling is for
[1:16:28] Madwo: FeelsDankMan
[1:16:29] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix a bit long but i think you should react this related to gold topic https://youtu.be/aB20PoitwXg?t=12
[1:16:29] Laawkey: @Alis_yazuki nah it can happen alis the system is automatic for most
[1:16:37] Alis_yazuki: Hmmge
[1:16:45] Alis_yazuki: lawki i moved about 900 gold
[1:16:47] detoxjukebox: giiive me pls
[1:16:50] Alis_yazuki: and i havent been banned Hmmge
[1:16:55] emikochan13: they said it'd be coming later phase cause it's a huge gold sink
[1:16:55] knifefite: BingusGun
[1:16:56] Laawkey: @Alis_yazuki yea but u didnt move 900 in one go
[1:16:57] sickish: probably hard to implement in their spaghetti code
[1:16:58] Qeevdo: Sounded like they want to use it as a gold sink
[1:17:05] Soulzone: Quest KEKW no its gonna be another goldsink
[1:17:07] legend_0tb: nah 100g another sink
[1:17:08] Alis_yazuki: i moved 300 in one go with savix and 200 with listrel
[1:17:12] brakealot: they need to BUFF RET and feral CAT
[1:17:16] Czepix: probably delayed because of mounts
[1:17:18] Deadge_Gartic: they said its gonna be gold sink
[1:17:18] RighteousBuddy: that pala not too bad looking for level 40, I like it @Savix
[1:17:19] emikochan13: it'll be more than 100g for sure
[1:17:20] 7thSaga: jimblesWily Sexiest phase you say?
[1:17:20] hutchie24: having dual spec would also fix the issue of not finding tanks and healers
[1:17:22] FelipeLLs: did u got the jack hammer ? @Savix
[1:17:23] DankWizard420: @emikochan13 something else like 2% of players will get YEP
[1:17:24] iPlayCuzFun: did u get the jacker?
[1:17:24] xirva: green gremlin
[1:17:37] RighteousBuddy: payoZ
[1:17:42] DankWizard420: dual spec as a goldsink doesnt work and it's sad blizzard are even thinking about it
[1:17:44] bliz0th: @Savix IHaveAQuestion was there merch plug already?
[1:17:47] poopooindiaper: Evening @Savix & chat. Just released a flock of sparrows.
[1:17:50] emikochan13: @hutchie24 people don't need to respec to tank or heal, the people not doing it are making a choice
