[0:37:06] nonprophetz: 2x4 just needs to be braced to one another i promise
[0:37:07] Luistezinn: holy shit i can´t even draw a stickman without a crooked line
[0:37:07] Ghettofly503: 4x4 one
[0:37:08] TUNAFISHCOWBOYI: like framing a floor
[0:37:09] VulnoDaGreat: Decks are supported by 4x4s usually so you good

[0:37:58] LufaKlaskie: Better for it to be overkill than for it to collapse
[0:37:59] f00kme: 2x4 is fine
[0:38:04] TUNAFISHCOWBOYI: 2x6 󠀀
[0:38:07] lotsodeath: finite element analysis
[0:38:09] excedrins: wait why dont you think 2x4 can hold you
[0:38:10] gandalfgrey91: 2x4 but you need middle supports depending how deep you built it

[0:38:28] nonprophetz: If you want to use 2x6 but 4x4 or 4x6 or 6x6 is way over kill
[0:38:29] kreloril777: just add more 1x2's
[0:38:32] Zacing: 4*4 would be good if it was in CM ;)

[2:56:36] StreevTV: consult your doctor but I prefer a time-released solution like concerta
[2:56:36] Mcguigz117: You don’t need drugs, just do battlegrounds with me.
[2:56:39] Hudman73: ya good idea talk to your doctor b4 you do that
[2:56:43] hazymydude: normal is kinda boring but depends how your adhd presents. I'm primarily inattentive and my life is a disaster without them

[2:56:53] deeble_d: how many wow characters do u have
[2:56:53] Borrybuir: adderall is a good tool to learn how to deal with ADHD. but it is not the cure to ADHD.  You need to invest the time and self learning about how to equip yourself with the tools to handle it through therapy / psychology. The meds make it easier to understand how to cope.
[2:56:56] sixtwunycx: If it is hereditary and im your father i am sorry.
[2:56:58] AyoKeoWTF: Does your Adhd cause a lot of problems for you? Like outside of gaming?
[2:57:04] NailnScrew: forget adderall for adhd, just get a magic 8 ball so you can shake it and get an answer that might trigger something in your head

[2:58:54] tamanoonie: why don’t you make a poll?
[2:58:54] Sasqtch: you still cant even do a 2 story house
[2:58:56] sixtwunycx: Um ... Getting skerd
[2:58:57] LufaKlaskie: the game has everything YEP
[2:59:01] Atruis_: HUH
[2:59:03] AyoKeoWTF: You have to remove the cocomelon filter on Palworld
[2:59:04] sloppyjoker89: i'd love to see another scary horror game night with bee YEP
[2:59:04] PorgeePie: You can slaughter people for their meat
[2:59:05] lurkis2jerkis: is it bestiality if they have humanlike consciousness

[3:00:11] pOpdoWg: !drops
[3:00:16] StreevTV: most people waiting for p2 on feb 8th
[3:00:27] Gorakk82: p2 will blow up stv is really good
[3:00:30] N3MEAN: @PalmBee I don't care if the chat saw it, ADD and adderall are important to me, because I've lived it my whole life. adderall works, but it's at a cost.
[3:00:30] thefrostywolf97: I just got palworld and i'm having a lot of fun with it
[3:00:31] halfghostsmite: I still haven't made it to lvl 25 Sadge
[3:00:39] deeble_d: omg booty bay I remember pvp
[3:00:43] thefrostywolf97: Wouldn't mind watching a stream of it while i'm playing (I'm weird like that xD)
[3:00:44] CheckemChuck: sod is fuckin lit
[3:00:45] StreevTV: @halfghostsmite it could be worse, you could have 5 of them like me

[3:01:51] Jargoyle_: Have you played with any other classes in SoD?
[3:01:52] AyoKeoWTF: And then hit a wall
[3:01:58] BerkTheLUL: palworld is cozy af
[3:02:00] Sasqtch: valid
[3:02:03] ZuVision: must feel weird, 25 cap
[3:02:04] thefrostywolf97: I vote for Palworld
[3:02:04] PorgeePie: touch your Pal....world
[3:02:07] therealzugzugzugs: pvp tho?
[3:02:12] Hudman73: play it till season 2
[3:02:17] thefrostywolf97: That's what i'm doing while i'm waiting for phase 2

[3:02:34] MrTR1M: lol patch for phase 2 will prerelease to download
[3:02:38] N3MEAN: @PalmBee That's why I recommended vyvanse, way less side effects versus the benefits. It keeps me on track, without divebombing my metabolism. My Dr said I have the highest insulin resistance she's ever seen in a otherwise healthy 34 year old male
[3:02:40] MrTR1M: so nothing will be a surprise :P
[3:02:43] nonprophetz: what are we not talking aboot
[3:03:11] AyoKeoWTF: Fresh yet again
[3:03:17] rymerre: except it will all be on wowhead
[3:03:22] Gorakk82: yeah its great
[3:03:29] StreevTV: the only downside to this phase with the runes is theyre very heavily alliance-favored, its been annoying as horde
[3:03:32] MrTR1M: you are wrong
[3:03:32] sixtwunycx: I thought youarw the only normie on the platform 😆😍😍
[3:03:35] MrTR1M: no it will be fast

[3:03:50] ZuVision: idk if i missed chat but how are hunters doing?
[3:03:50] iBanEvader: you can choose to go blind
[3:03:56] Borrybuir: yea you can avoid the info online
[3:03:56] sixtwunycx: What is a symptom that troubles you?
[3:03:59] Sasqtch: and by fun you mean people gotta die?
