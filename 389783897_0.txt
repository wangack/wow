[4:45:52] jaaroy: @opalcandy its different, mana burn was a fairly long cast, it was interruptable and could be grounded as shaman and shapeshifted as druid, the only really susceptible healer to it was hpal but hpal was busted during wrath. it also could be easily LoSed and avoided in general. DH mana burn is basically unavoidable with the cc tools they have
