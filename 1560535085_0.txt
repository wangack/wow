[1:52:48] dldrzoidberg: everyone else but you
[1:52:56] Reydien: if you want to be pro, you can time a taunt right at the end of the repentance cast:  the boss will do a single auto-attack before casting her spell, which will break you out
[1:53:01] Reydien: mistime it and you're in trouble, though
[1:53:19] dldrzoidberg: bl after first repent

[2:04:18] Sicss: @Towelliee apparently the boss always wanna prior the healer if no bleeds, u can kings the healer while the boss is casting vanish, to make him go for the healer again next time
[2:04:24] Spacy_Dude: I think maiden is the hardest. Just because of the DPS check.
[2:05:14] miztertea1: Hard right down the stairs
[2:05:32] Ryukotsu: Thank god the bleed isint perma bleed anymore...they nerfed that as well xD
[2:05:34] miztertea1: Clear right then back around left
[2:05:43] Reydien: WA makes the ghost debuff trivial
[2:05:47] Ryukotsu: once he bled u it lasted the whole entire fight no matter what
[2:06:00] dldrzoidberg: healer needs to dispell the correct person with ghost debuff
[2:06:00] Reydien: gotta full clear the first floor
[2:06:02] dldrzoidberg: else whipe
[2:06:03] miztertea1: WA for dispel.  Dispel wrong person all die
[2:06:07] Ryukotsu: The boss will pull all the mobs
[2:06:22] lobawow: omg the horse i hate that boss
[2:06:24] luke238: boss pulls all mobs that are still up on pull
[2:06:35] dldrzoidberg: clear all room here
[2:06:37] Kapptive: The whole floor you’re in
[2:06:37] xurelto: pull the boss and see XD
[2:06:43] Kapptive: Has to be cleared
[2:06:50] Ryukotsu: Yes...you can do the fight with some of them up and cleave them down but u take a big risk
[2:07:22] Ishva: yup
[2:07:46] Ryukotsu: I healed one the other day where a tank pulled half the room with the boss but it was only an 8...still hurt like hell

[2:10:40] miztertea1: During the part he hops off the horse.  Pull him far after third horse charge so everyone can stack for shared suffering
[2:10:41] Zilberg: If healer dispels wrong person its a wipe
[2:10:45] shaxxtv: tank away from grp with mortal stike
[2:10:45] Reydien: soak shared suffering, mortal strike is a cleave (don't aim it at the ranged/healer)
[2:10:49] shaxxtv: stack for shared
[2:10:53] ventu105: lol

[3:29:58] Xetherot: my brain hurts @MikeyGy
[3:29:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Wasn't the main feature for DH's that they could double jump? Not that they could glide, mage's already had that forever with slow fall.
[3:30:04] Zigg3man: are envoker similiar to rogue class? if no, I won't reroll, since DH is like rogue tho w/o stealth and w dubble jump :)

[4:58:18] spiked16: i think january is the safest bet
[4:58:24] dracullus: its either must come mid November or just push everything to January
[4:58:27] m4gnify: have it open, so what if people can't finish it at once, let them farm gear, work towards it
[4:58:32] valarbravoosi: lvling is part of RWF KEKW
[4:58:36] monstayou7: Can they even push it back?
[4:58:49] Laluzmia: Cool
[4:58:51] Laluzmia: lol
[4:58:56] dracullus: it's not about world first, it's about normal people doing their M+/raid/PVP
[4:59:43] jamarky23: I really hope they delay
[4:59:48] m4gnify: they're obligated to release it in December, right?
[4:59:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath is going to keep a lot of us happy for awhile, January is not the worst
[4:59:52] FranciscoTheMage: delay? they've never really announced a date have they?
[4:59:58] Provision_: @dracullus launch is all about world first tho, give them so much exposure as free advertisement.
[4:59:58] Bogzeh: delaying expac just cuz of mythic raiders sounds horrible to me
[5:00:04] tedol: November is last Q of 2022,right and December is first Q of 2023,right?
[5:00:51] JellonaCub: and because release just before holidays doesnt feel as good as january release
[5:01:09] tebbix: The delay of shadowlands was good for the expansion, the problem was 9.1
[5:01:14] Thoreya: gna be the same time as SL release
[5:01:15] monstayou7: im not so sure this time around

[5:03:46] amsa92: someone check that on youtube for me pls and say I'm right xD
[5:04:30] Provision_: @BillBob605 since no blizzcon they save a lot of money, so they could pump that price money

[5:33:02] ZenRayn: Funnily enough, from an arena pvp perspective if you build your evoker for blue spells its actually better to never empower your spells beyond level 1

[5:55:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Advanced" just seems to mean starting at a higher level
[5:56:01] Funderik: not advanced to a vet, it's abit much if you are new/returning after many years

[5:56:17] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[5:57:21] ventu105: when prepatch of DF coming I wanna play Evoker plz

[5:58:03] Brick_Bosworth: yes

[6:01:05] Ensanee: @Towelliee have you watched Everything everywhere all at once? Good movie would recommend

[6:28:48] XshadowturkeyX: nothing is 0% look we got tauren rogues

[6:32:08] akia03: @Rudric_Ice bliz said thats outlaw now
[6:32:18] Aphro_Samurai: @dwolters_the_zombieman problem is wow lore has nou automatic weapons like a pistol. only blunderbusses and for you ssbows that you reload per shot. lore wise it wouldn't work
[6:32:22] manmower: sounds like endgame content
[6:32:27] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: o7

[6:34:06] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Aphro_Samurai then why do qotlaw rogues have pistol shot
[6:34:16] nuudelz: prob cause every new class has been tank
[6:34:25] martianxl: They totally need a evoker tank.
[6:34:29] Bayne77: mid range tank ftw
[6:34:34] sUPERHJELTEn: Because we have enough tanks!
[6:34:38] looney199725: but black dragons make sense as a tank
[6:34:45] dwolters_the_zombieman: outlaw
[6:34:46] Kaernunnos: still weird leather has 3 tanks but mail 0
[6:34:50] Greybeard_ttv: just make them beefy with small wings lol
[6:34:54] akia03: rapid fire, barage in hunter tree are automatic fire weapons
[6:34:54] dracullus: they wanted 2 specs, that's it
[6:34:56] Voidred: Evoker would have been perfect to be the first Mail armor tank
[6:35:01] slamueljaksn: @Towelliee is there any standout professions u think will be good money makers? other than the gathering ones

[6:35:20] Bayne77: make dracthyr tank one of those beefy four legged dragonkin
[6:35:38] Aphro_Samurai: pistol shot isn't an automatic weapon. gunslinger in wow would only work as a tinkerer kinda class. you don't wanna go that way. you'll b locked to gnome or goblin lol 🤣
[6:36:11] chulklol: no i mean the  new dungouen  there is something to click on ans it need alchemy skill of 25

[6:45:01] manmower: sounds like the uncapped valor actually working for his guild mixed comp
[6:45:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the raiders are lagging behind
[6:45:11] TheItalianStallion321: that sounds like a his problem
[6:45:14] Thoreya: Sounds like a raid problem to me
[6:45:22] sadstruggle: sadstruggle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! towHAMUP
[6:45:25] Thoreya: Maybe have raid drop loot twice a week instead of once
[6:45:27] girthyderps: Doesn't the valor cap come back with new raids? I think this is a moot point now.
[6:45:27] Bayne77: all im hearing is WAHHHHAAAAAA
[6:45:29] Silverwards: putting the + in Mythic+ LUL
[6:45:31] nuudelz: i personally cant stand how hyper focused theyve been with m+

[6:45:56] manmower: 298
[6:45:56] Scoodles91: 298
[6:45:58] KGB_Habs: 298
[6:45:59] looney199725: 298 is max
[6:46:00] matching_towels: M+ is repeatable for loot. Raid is not. So m+ ppl have jumped up in ilvl
[6:46:01] Mitune: yeah it a win. if you want to raid raid if not m+ the end goal is the same
[6:46:01] kronospally19: 298 i believe
[6:46:03] Aphro_Samurai: 298
[6:46:12] ChaseD93: hes saying its hard for his guild to raid because the people that dont have time for mythic+ farming are under geared.
[6:46:13] KGB_Habs: 272
[6:46:26] Brad_157: Mythic is 304
[6:46:36] manmower: if he gets done he can start gearing alts for once
[6:46:54] tronbadgames: @Towelliee here's the problem with that guys point. fated raids will be unlocked, and thats 30 bosses per week..
[6:47:07] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[6:47:09] looney199725: it just rewards you for playing alot instead of cucking you
[6:47:22] matching_towels: LUL
[6:47:33] matching_towels: M+ Is in a great place
[6:47:59] looney199725: m+ is great overall

[6:48:38] Mitune: I love kara it's fun imo
[6:48:50] RarhMT: yo dude, was wondering what you thought about guilds like Limit having alpha access.... especially when they are doing competitions for world first raids
[6:48:55] Aphro_Samurai: I hate grimrail because it's too linear. there are no routes is just straight ahead
[6:48:57] looney199725: mistakes were made aha
[6:49:03] Bernardo994: umm.. what is that dragon eye near your bags
[6:49:11] tronbadgames: peace man
