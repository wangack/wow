[0:18:23] Jeebleschrist: idk why slikker would come out and announce that when it could get him in trouble.
[0:18:27] HeyItsRyanOK: @HaalandCravador sliker scammed 100's of people out of 300+ k
[0:18:37] RYANiME: Silker seemed really hesitant to go to rehab
[0:18:38] Undercover_Pirate: Miz does not get how serious this really is
[0:18:45] HaalandCravador: @heyitsryanok sliker its a gambling website?

[0:18:54] Undercover_Pirate: rehab is the last part
[0:18:54] wirazure: hachu Sadge
[0:18:55] imnihiliste: its hard to take anything miz gets involves with since he is notoriously a content farmer that doesnt take anything serious.
[0:18:56] errorWRONGuser: easy way out of a complex issue
[0:19:03] Jeebleschrist: slikker needs to scam the money for rehab
[0:19:04] Grumplekin: did sliker try to borrow money from u? @jakenbakeLIVE

[0:20:41] Sepalone: @jakenbakeLIVE the worst thing about sliker he's muslim hes making the muslims so bad. like i'm a muslim
[0:20:43] 04x15: Sliker should work in a coal mine to make up for it Pog

[0:20:56] powcats: powcats subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! hi jake, #twitchstopgambling

[0:21:18] Kurzyck: @Sepalone thats definitely not the worst thing lmao
[0:21:20] reezinuO_: bouta get a infomercial saying “if you were scammed by slicker call this number to get compensated” KEKW
[0:21:24] RYANiME: monkaHmm
[0:21:27] 1regis: imagine cracking jokes with someone who scammed a cancer patient
[0:21:30] superwar89: slikers more cooked than Amazons books OMEGALUL

[0:21:32] BIGGUSV: shit would be fraud no?
[0:21:33] anonx_: one last job so i he can flee the country i think

[0:21:37] Marksman1741: yup
[0:21:37] gordkoff: he should be in jail
[0:21:37] Hugh_Jahsse: civil lawsuit maybe

[0:21:43] poulain9: civil at this point no?
[0:21:44] Starwinpikachu: wawaShrug
[0:21:44] TodoGuts: You should be going to jail, yes
[0:21:45] Jeebleschrist: one would think, but Idk UK law
[0:21:46] SynthRiffs: i think people have to report it to police
[0:21:47] evadcobra1: wire fraud & conspiracy
[0:21:47] evolv3920: FRAUD
[0:21:47] hobo_puncher: Civil suit
[0:21:49] QWEC69: probably civil
[0:21:50] ShameRock: embezzlement?
[0:21:50] CallMeDoubleYou: its a shit show. Multiple fraud counts in multiple countries @jakenbakeLIVE
[0:21:50] imnihiliste: @Sepalone eh thats more of a personal issue not something that reflects on a muslim. I think muslim stereotypes and racism is a lot worse from other things.
[0:21:51] suave12209: Over 10k yea
[0:21:53] drewsny: money fraud for sure, in the US probably illegal in 5 different ways
[0:21:53] Undercover_Pirate: @jakenbakeLIVE and when its worldwide you get Interpol on your neck
[0:21:55] legend_1013: Absolutely
[0:21:55] lalo_456: he definitely going to court
[0:21:56] Koala_Koa: Fruad in the USA can send you to jail for up to 15 years
[0:21:57] SynthRiffs: seems like no one really has gone to police i think
[0:21:57] Hugh_Jahsse: Im not sure a law was broken
[0:21:58] neverust: not for small scams like Sliker did
[0:21:58] zolep: yea whatever the laws are in the uk
[0:22:00] kt4star: it's not a crime if he intend to pay it back
[0:22:01] evadcobra1: YEP
[0:22:03] 반_요다: 🤔
[0:22:04] keok: people have to report
[0:22:06] dosiacsgofrog: I think its too difficult to prove intent
[0:22:07] RandieFromEstonia: Interpol would get involved for sure
[0:22:08] gordkoff: 100% crime
[0:22:08] BIGGUSV: theres so many victims and international too
[0:22:09] hobo_puncher: If they gave him the money willingly nah
[0:22:10] 부산데이터엔지니어: He should go to jail
[0:22:10] imnihiliste: its also international at this point...
[0:22:12] quarterlol: @kt4star lmao what
[0:22:13] rugaTV: he would get off with a lawyer because his intent was not to scma
[0:22:13] reezinuO_: it’s grand larceny
[0:22:13] silentchu: its a crime
[0:22:14] StarwalkerZah: yea over like 1,000 or 10,000 is like a felony
[0:22:14] randomtwitchviewer000: it is crimial and in this case it's also international
[0:22:15] evadcobra1: wire fraud
[0:22:18] drewsny: financial fraud in the US is usually open and shut and the gov can choose to prosecute
[0:22:22] spicy4trunks: It's felony larceny
[0:22:24] ZanCrow94: yeah if people report to the police
[0:22:24] Undercover_Pirate: theres enough videos of sliker
[0:22:26] hobo_puncher: No contracts
[0:22:28] evolv3920: HE CANT PAY BACK>>> FRAUD
[0:22:28] legend_1013: He’s not getting with it, he will eventually be charged
[0:22:29] drewsny: look at what happened to martin shrkeli
[0:22:29] sweggelo: It’s on the fence
[0:22:30] sooviz: I mean there’s a lot of evidence online
[0:22:32] Taunchi: Wait what happened
[0:22:38] purphaze777: tax evasion too
[0:22:42] dosiacsgofrog: Intent to pay it back
[0:22:43] rugaTV: but its easier to prove he had intent to pay back. He has proof of paying people back
[0:22:45] Jeebleschrist: I think he just admitted to a lot on stream too
[0:22:47] Undercover_Pirate: @jakenbakeLIVE its a crime in europe and brexica as well
[0:22:47] Hugh_Jahsse: good question
[0:22:48] 42KupoNuts: You need to prove he never intended to pay back
[0:22:52] k0kyu: he had no intent to pay it back OMEGALUL
[0:22:53] itsblankky: I dont think anyone has made a report or anything so nothing has been done in a legal way
[0:22:54] Xaqin: real world ? what's that ? Kappa
[0:22:55] 04x15: Seen a lot of racist comments because of this, sad
[0:22:55] NickoOne: sliker has the best lawyer already PepeLaugh
[0:22:58] BIGGUSV: kinda like crypto scammers Aware
[0:22:59] Jason0110: MmmHmm so how much did you get scammed for jacob?
[0:23:01] evolv3920: NO INTENT!
[0:23:06] randomtwitchviewer000: He does to jail for few years. The money is paid back from selling of his stuff
[0:23:08] Koala_Koa: He stole from americans would be subpoenad and his passport and entry to the states pending warrent
[0:23:10] 04x15: @NickoOne Better call Saul KEKW
[0:23:10] cyclingpanda: we're gonna see him on Coffeezilla and he'll explain it to us
[0:23:14] evadcobra1: Twitch will probaby be scrutinized more for promoting gambling
[0:23:16] RYANiME: it is weird
[0:23:18] Jeebleschrist: is that coffee?
[0:23:18] xiaweijun: how much did u send sliker be honest
[0:23:18] anonx_: i dont think "i was gonna pay it back" flies in court lol
[0:23:36] ramp7: oatmilk Pog
[0:23:40] Jedgar6: problem is he's paid some people back and most convos didn't mention a pay by date. It'd take considerable effort to win that lawsuit
[0:23:41] KANZENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN: oatmilk horchata? latte

[1:15:21] Nibheis: minoxidil/rogaine increases blood flow to the area but doesnt stop loss.... finasteride blocks dht (converted from testosterone) if taken by pill which prevents folicle miniturisation leading to loss... combined u get good hair but its at a risk ofc

[1:21:25] stormblaz: go cald
[1:21:27] Ange1ism: Its a risk, r u a gambler
[1:21:32] G0MLVL: it's defo worth it from everyone I've seen
[1:21:33] gordkoff: not worth, as a guy that shaves his head
[1:21:35] kebabpriest: I will quit minoxidil after I am 40.
[1:21:35] karry_lole: both of them
[1:21:40] TheNotoriousAlexx: Dude I’ve been taking seamoss /burdock capsules and dandelion root for the organic route for all the nutrients we need in our bodies and I’ve noticed My hair thinned but since I been taking them , I’ve seen growth

[1:21:51] cyclingpanda: have you tried pura d'or shampoo from amazon?
[1:21:54] medicaljosh: just got in here the risks for what?
[1:21:55] ZER0ATH: Do the pills increase hair growth all over the body? Or just head?
[1:21:55] gag_on: @karry_lole did you start both at same time?
[1:21:56] dantokii: I take topical finasteride
[1:21:59] Jeebleschrist: That's the thing, it's such a big change to your life and there is so much involved in patching something as stupid as hairloss. I say just don't worry about it, hair is hair. no one cares if ur losing it in reality
[1:22:02] ramp7: I've heard rosemary oil helps but I have no idea
[1:22:15] rugaTV: ya ive also heard topical is better
[1:22:16] sudomaymays: eat dandelion roots straight from the ground for the best effect
[1:22:20] karry_lole: Ya topical works better and focuses that area :)
[1:22:21] Jeebleschrist: yes
[1:22:32] dantokii: Lower risk you can always stop
[1:22:34] EatYoVegetablez: Yeah
[1:22:35] axelsonder: start it and if you see side effects stop NODDERS
[1:22:35] ThatLitDJ: Just wear a wig 4Head
[1:22:37] EatYoVegetablez: go for it
[1:22:37] kebabpriest: @jakenbakeLIVE I also take it from topical. I love minoxidil. I am not gonna joke. It should be used by everyone
[1:22:38] Dizziedreamer: dude use a dermaroller too
[1:22:40] Starwinpikachu: do it
[1:22:41] G0MLVL: it'd defo try it if you wanna mate.
[1:22:42] Jeebleschrist: sure, try it
[1:22:42] evolv3920: YES
[1:22:43] Nibheis: if u get the permanent side effects stopping does nothing, but u can start/stop... minoxidil will lead to hair shedding more at first too from what i read
[1:22:44] 77madman_: you have to try it for 6 months.
[1:22:44] ichigo_gyunyu_: try

[1:23:02] evolv3920: if you dont like your results after 3 months... JUST STOP
[1:23:04] EatYoVegetablez: Have you seen a Dermatologist Jake?
[1:23:06] Dizziedreamer: just pray
[1:23:10] thebiglaubski: can a broken dick get unbroken?
[1:23:11] Jeebleschrist: u won't get permanent side effects
[1:23:12] kebabpriest: @jakenbakeLIVE I only used minox
[1:23:19] G0MLVL: you can use both but most people only use on because there's less side-effects @jakenbakeLIVE
[1:23:21] kebabpriest: and still use it

[1:24:57] Ange1ism: Depends
[1:25:04] mardii17: @jakenbakelive if it is not medically necessary it is not covered
[1:25:04] JiGGAs159: Yes.  It is a specialist visit
[1:25:07] ramp7: I think it depends on what. I used to pay only $100 per derma visit
[1:25:11] deftw0lf: I would talk to your main dr and get a referral from them, usually it is cheaper to do it that way.
[1:25:13] plyoun: most liekly not in PPO
[1:25:17] JDmaybe: Have you seen what you look like with a buzz cut?
[1:25:20] mardii17: @jakenbakelive anything beauty related is not

[1:25:35] gag_on: your main GP can perscribe
[1:25:35] Libercons: pop the pill
[1:25:36] karry_lole: Yeah it is better to be preemptive.
[1:25:39] Starwinpikachu: go to main doc -> referral
[1:25:41] reezinuO_: i got Goldilocks lowkey neffCool
[1:25:44] Jeebleschrist: yeah, no harm in trying, but keep your expectations realistic
[1:25:46] JiGGAs159: My main doctor was the one that recommended minoxidil.  Not a dermatologist
[1:25:47] Beeriant: allergy test?
[1:25:51] gag_on: ah
[1:25:52] ramp7: your GP would refer you to someone in your network
[1:25:53] Crushzilla: do the sprays help that much for receding? or mostly used for the top/crown? or is it all the same
[1:25:57] stormblaz: always call to see if thr derma is good with hair thinning
[1:26:00] ZER0ATH: Start now so you don’t end up with Trumps combover LUL
[1:26:08] kebabpriest: @jakenbakeLIVE don't be 2 late, bc hair loss can't be reversed. In a certain point it will be truly over.
[1:26:11] sudomaymays: if you want if you don't want it covered by insurance yeah
[1:26:11] plyoun: yes thats exactly what they will do
[1:26:12] EatYoVegetablez: yeah thats smart

[1:38:22] Jeebleschrist: sounds like LPR

[1:39:47] missmousewc: you need to go to GI and get and upper and lower scope to rule certain things out.
[1:39:49] mardii17: Yea anxiety is def something most docs don’t take into consideration
