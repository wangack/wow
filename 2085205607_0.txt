[0:53:57] pegboy: the fact that you can choose between a senile and a psycho is hilarious
[0:53:58] Punchatron5000: illegals get counted in census which alters house seats and electoral votes

[1:00:44] somebdk: what made enhance shamans so good now?
[1:00:48] RanciusAdventures: let’s talk about the newest inflationary promises of Biden. housing interest rates locked in for 2 years only then they shoot up to 7%. we have seen how well Americans deal with adjustable rate mortgages in the past…

[1:40:52] Crusar: bots subscribe, if they ban before they make profit, they wont buy new accounts, so they leave them to make profit for 3+ months, then do a ban weave, but since its profitable this way for the bots, they buy new account.

[1:44:00] gromp_vendor: @NotTheWheel Yeah a lot of people do it tho, you dont even have to invite them you just do /who and type "inv" and the bot mages will insta invite you
[1:44:07] DankWizard420: @andypandynz then you've not played pservers enough, actual game ruining behaviour like bots/hacks are dealt with
[1:44:15] fart_boiii: what shud i do with this oil packet
[1:44:18] Tomoglaziat: most of the bots i flag i get a response from Blizzard thanking me .
[1:44:28] onkeliltis: private servers....

[1:45:06] andypandynz: @DankWizard420 u said private server had good hack proteection lol
[1:45:09] DankWizard420: @andypandynz it's a reputation issue not a anticheat issue
[1:45:12] BostromTV: layed off good ppl Sadge
[1:45:20] sicknope: We need more soldiers to report bots!
[1:45:25] psykfall69: @gromp_vendor pretty sure all bots saves all whispers with a print screen tho
[1:45:25] Valencia_Pete: thats like half of microsofts profits
[1:45:27] seymourmoney: maybe just an allocation of resources?
[1:45:27] onkeliltis: it is deliberate
[1:45:27] DankWizard420: @andypandynz actually dealing WITH cheats IS anticheat, the method doesnt matter
[1:45:32] pastterino: we need bots that report other bots
[1:45:59] andypandynz: @DankWizard420 u implied they had better hack prevention than blizz thats all saying LUL

[1:47:25] gromp_vendor: Someone was streaming that before already but i think they got banned a while ago or quit @StaysafeTV
[1:47:28] HotFlatDietPepsi: Blizzard would have them taken down and not talk about it

[2:54:47] monorideadge: Bruggor SMOrc
[2:54:48] NotTheWheel: No aggro?
[2:54:53] cakesnpie: Nah there's a lvl 1 bot
[2:55:06] cakesnpie: lmfao
[2:55:07] biofan45: between retail, classic, ssf classic and SOD there is too many versions of this shit

[2:55:41] morphyck: so many bots already..
[2:55:55] cakesnpie: gnomes bis
[2:55:56] Ervill1: bots make up 33% of population, factually
[2:55:57] evermore777: 33% of playerbase is bots, better than SoD
[2:56:01] morphyck: I guarantee you Bliz won't ban GDKP in Cata because they have the WoW token. 100%.
[2:56:06] Raivan994: this kind of no danger leveling is when it starts to feel like a chore rather than an adventure
[2:56:07] NotTheWheel: D:
[2:56:10] cakesnpie: yea you're dead
[2:56:10] Fleshwallet: Can't copy max level yet?

[2:56:24] Roxannamyu: not even close
[2:56:25] badsign_: do you not have to train abilities anymore?
[2:56:25] Arcsilin: @morphyck well they didnt ban it in wrath or era so prolly not
[2:56:27] andypandynz: @morphyck they only banned it in sod to see what the reaction is stop trying to make conspiracies LMAO
[2:56:39] morphyck: Bliz only cares about $ they don't care about the integrity of the game. If wow token was in SOD, GDKP would be thriving right now and never have been bnned
[2:56:49] Syborc: Just like SoD the world is a joke
[2:56:53] NotTheWheel: :|
[2:56:57] NotTheWheel: LUL
[2:56:59] cakesnpie: prob not

[2:57:07] Mipolarization: Which is why I won't even bother.
[2:57:13] Mawshaw: They won't but I hope they will Sadge
[2:57:14] WillowJane: @morphyck I highly doubt most people are getting their gold from the WoW token, anyways.
[2:57:25] Vannicavus: theyre testing out this gdkp prevention system on sod.. means they may plan to use it in other versions.. ie.. cata
[2:57:32] Raivan994: @andypandynz surely it's not because SoD has no token Kappa
[2:57:34] evermore777: @Vannicavus unless..
[2:57:36] Multar_: Oh no is it cata time?
[2:57:39] andypandynz: @morphyck "blizz only cares about money" while i tell u guys they dont have atoken in sod
[2:57:44] itsae__: gold buying BASED
[2:57:45] electric_f33l: GDKP is like 90% of benediction playerbase KEKW
[2:57:45] Akrew09: NO WAY THEY GONNA BAN GDKP ON CATA
[2:58:02] morphyck: @andypandynz nobody would play if they did, that's the only reason
[2:58:15] andypandynz: @morphyck based on what
[2:58:16] NotTheWheel: ugh this music
[2:58:26] WillowJane: It's riskier but if anything the token drove the price of third-party gold down so that the risk was more worth it.
[2:58:27] NotTheWheel: I think I'm bleeding out of my nose
[2:58:27] cakesnpie: idk some people like that high risk high reward lol not me tho I aint losing my account
[2:58:38] cakesnpie: iron forge is zombieland

[3:45:40] Magalampe: Have you been reading any exciting recently ?
[3:45:41] Ratiomatters: do you think sod will die when cata comes out?
[3:45:49] plasmatwice: why you skipping goblins?

[3:46:28] cjadude: trueski
[3:46:30] thebedshow: If they were smart they would add a new rune slot that is cosmetic in nature or for fun only
[3:46:31] sighwarlock: 40 phase did good with passives.
[3:46:36] coolcrazyguy72: why else would a huge company like Microsoft buy wow in its state
[3:46:38] reddbeardo: would be neat if at 60 they let you mix rune slots
[3:46:39] Wingsofjanitor: and then people will complain that the passive runes are boring KEKL
[3:47:14] Curtsy: Blizzard isn't just wow lol yeah

[4:05:27] Utmost777: i think beta access is limited because I signed up and did not get flagged yet

[4:06:02] JetGC: what is the rush man?
[4:06:03] fafoo204: P2 better than P1 anyways
[4:06:07] sportingista86: Can we just skip right to 60 instead of 50 in SoD
[4:06:09] kalex214: new mic looks great. sounds nice too
[4:06:10] chuckstieg: Play alts you freaks, leveling has never been easier
[4:06:20] ElDiosDeOro: just to go gnomer again KEKW
[4:06:21] JetGC: why the rush? @StaysafeTV

[4:06:24] kboyyyyy: gonna be 6 weeks
[4:06:24] fartguyl: im enjoying p2 as much as p1 but ive leveled 3 toons and enjoy alts
[4:06:27] yuckil: they had a timeline thing
[4:06:28] keyboardwarrior32: month and a half more
[4:06:30] tenwick: p1 was 2 months and a few days
[4:06:32] Knastis: problem is if it was only 3 weeks they probably would have said that already
[4:06:36] Muaytitus: def going to be longer than 3w
[4:06:36] JetGC: why the rush? @StaysafeTV ?
[4:06:43] pangemange123: minors or miners?
[4:06:45] TrumpWallWorker: they are on the island obviously
[4:06:45] TurboBased: theyre in a NYC tunnel
[4:06:46] kompany111: What do we even do at 50? farm ST and mara? ZF?
[4:06:46] Joewrx: i feel its gonna be like 6 weeks at least. we know blizzard is gonna give casuals at least a months notice for p3
[4:06:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: they're probably in Epstien's island...
[4:06:50] plasmatwice: @StaysafeTV Do you know any other BASED streamers? I like your channel I want to follow more people like you
[4:06:51] Aumua: if you were a miner, where would you be?
[4:06:58] swaee: theyre in the cave in nyc
[4:07:06] juiced96: not like p1 had more to offer

[4:07:11] Joewrx: i have 5 lol. almost 6
[4:07:11] JetGC: ive almost got my 2nd toon to 40
[4:07:14] cjadude: yep minimum 2
[4:07:17] Ervill1: people dont like to hear this but SoD is just Cata minus
[4:07:22] jack3dpotato: Im still trying to get more than 3 pieces of gear on my main OMEGALUL
[4:07:22] kompany111: can someone clip that? i wanna send that to my guild
[4:07:38] Aumua: make an alt
[4:07:38] ShadowPoet: LUL
[4:07:42] keyboardwarrior32: quit middle of phase 1 before i realized i was just raid logging
[4:07:49] jdtopgun93: come push keys in retail
[4:07:50] NotTheWheel: Just take a break dood EZ
[4:07:57] hart_mk1: hello mr. staysafe, how is the cata beta?
[4:07:57] zaptcat: time to go back to hc
[4:08:01] jack3dpotato: Minors? HUIH
[4:08:03] jack3dpotato: HUH
[4:08:03] saund: I let my sub run out I feel that
[4:08:07] thebedshow: still not 60?
[4:08:13] r0xorzb0xorz: hasnt it only been out for like a month
[4:08:17] Jsibs: they said this reset was halfway point of phase 2
[4:08:19] saund: Playing osrs until p3 is out
[4:08:20] Aumua: have you seen deathwing yet?
[4:08:25] NotTheWheel: D:
[4:08:52] kompany111: I mean at this point to keep sod alts alive. they need to make the second you get to max level (50) being next you can instanly level an alt at 100% exp gains. @StaysafeTV thoughts?
[4:08:55] zixxxs: I remember deathwing used to fly around and roast people from the air
[4:08:55] trekoni: monkaW
[4:08:56] NotTheWheel: shouldn't they want people to test the end game stuff
[4:09:21] NotTheWheel: could at least let people make 85 toons
[4:09:30] terminx: sod is boring as hell nothing todo
[4:09:42] cheeto_mans: new content is very welcome
[4:09:50] cheeto_mans: id be down for the phase to end next week
[4:09:55] Metaphix: LULW
[4:10:00] terminx: 10 lv's in zf
[4:10:01] avoidedneXt: im thinking phase 2 is underwhelming because phase 3 has the content
[4:10:02] Aumua: oh god
[4:10:05] avoidedneXt: could be cope though
[4:10:09] lolsizzle: @StaysafeTV what do you think of the conspiracy of legacy wow releases aimed to catch up with retail so that the communities amalgamate?
[4:10:13] lemonchilllll: cath to 42/43?
[4:10:22] terminx: nope zf all the way
[4:10:25] kompany111: I have the zf mallet already. 99% of chat dreams of that right now
[4:10:27] plasmatwice: @lolsizzle they're not making wod classic bro
[4:10:34] r2thas: mages will grind zf until 54
[4:10:35] Playermodd: Do you think sod kinda killed the classic plus movement?
[4:10:39] lolsizzle: @plasmatwice true hahaha
[4:10:41] Shreddingly: Zulfarak Discovery let's go
[4:10:48] Camrock__: questing buff didnt help much?
[4:10:49] electric_f33l: YEP
[4:10:50] NotTheWheel: no
[4:10:55] postboy710: sod is classic+
[4:10:56] Voidbonx: sod is the classic plus movement ICANT
[4:10:59] NotTheWheel: I just play turtle
[4:11:02] hart_mk1: define killed tho?
[4:11:03] juiced96: HUH
[4:11:04] NotTheWheel: fuck sod tbh
[4:11:06] Jelerman: whats good matt
[4:11:11] SneakyChalupa: Tf, cata is out?? Or is this beta
[4:11:13] kompany111: bannger question!
[4:11:20] Metaphix: depends on what they do afte Naxx
[4:11:24] r0xorzb0xorz: @SneakyChalupa beta
[4:11:31] NotTheWheel: yep
[4:11:32] RueRunsIt: its just classic with spells from other exps
[4:11:33] sighwarlock: not enough new content/spells/zones/dungeons etc
[4:11:38] saberful: basically turtle wow :D
[4:11:38] sighwarlock: for a real +
[4:11:41] Ervill1: like adding northrend to classic?
[4:11:45] SneakyChalupa: Beta for a 14 year old expansion is wild
[4:11:52] chuckstieg: how OSRS does it
[4:11:53] terminx: they need to follow the osrs line
[4:11:54] SneakyChalupa: kidding, I get it
[4:11:58] Metaphix: drip fed us
[4:11:58] sighwarlock: grats
[4:12:02] Muaytitus: classic + is a new expac but not tbc
[4:12:06] Voidbonx: Sadge
[4:12:13] therealthracian: u dont think sod is classic plus tho
[4:12:14] sighwarlock: super sick new talent point!!
[4:12:16] therealthracian: they will give us new content
[4:12:17] suddenarthritis4: is classic+ just more patches after naxx?
[4:12:20] sportingista86: I can't wait till Panda classic
[4:12:25] NotTheWheel: how big is the new bag?
[4:12:26] yuckil: talentssssss
[4:12:33] plasmatwice: if classic community is big enough, they're going to be incentivised to do *something* with it
[4:12:33] saund: We will forever be beta testers for sod now, they got us
[4:12:34] Ervill1: @Muaytitus yeah but what would they add? unless they just come up with new lore
[4:12:39] ChillGrindGaming: Just fly?
[4:12:41] therealthracian: i feel like this is better than what i expected.
[4:12:42] ticklemextreme: my vision of classic + is polling new content big and small like osrs @StaysafeTV
[4:12:48] avoidedneXt: additional endgame content i guess
[4:12:49] Avntor: waSnn't there a f/p in quarry
[4:12:50] ChillGrindGaming: Right by a fp
[4:12:53] LunaMoonCakey: morning staysafe whats up, and hows ur morning going?
[4:12:55] plasmatwice: SoD was never classic + imo, never sold as it
[4:12:59] therealthracian: made all classes viable while keeping it classic vibe
[4:13:08] creaturesfan72: @plasmatwice it was literally sold as it at blizzcon
[4:13:13] big_stape_: pick ur talent!!
[4:13:18] privatorius: yoo you're level 10 now, how does the talent tree look like?
[4:13:25] Mawshaw: @creaturesfan72 Not true
[4:13:26] sighwarlock: destro!
[4:13:28] cheeto_mans: talent tree?
[4:13:31] Shreddingly: SoD feels like it is a project to ease in the player base to discover retail skills
[4:13:38] tenwick: sod can transition into that though
[4:13:39] Quakezilla69: when will cata drop you think?
[4:13:39] l0ud_h0use: TALENT TREE
[4:13:40] Bronloch: Classic+ = Vanilla with SW & OG housing LUL
[4:13:41] RueRunsIt: prayge that 60 we getnew content
[4:13:48] shadowlink1111: SoD feels like a big testing ground. Throw everything at the wall and see what sticks / what people like
[4:13:49] creaturesfan72: @Mawshaw are we forgetting the "classic plus a twist" line
[4:13:50] suddenarthritis4: i think they'll keep doing versions of SoD to help design a wow 2
[4:13:51] Premiare: What do you want for Classic+ then?
[4:13:51] NotTheWheel: @Shreddingly that's a good point
[4:13:51] ChillGrindGaming: Well said
[4:13:52] Aumua: none of it meets my definition of classic+ either
[4:13:55] sausauge_monster: sod is better than i thought they would do for classic
[4:13:56] chadworld77: im having a blast in Sod, i just dont get this hate
[4:13:56] juiced96: @Shreddingly most are just wotlk skills tho lol
[4:14:00] plasmatwice: I think SoD was stand-in for that they still don't quite know what to do with classic community (lots of subs) for long term, I imagine that they consider ideas behind scenes
[4:14:06] keyboardwarrior32: whats the point of making us wait for content
[4:14:23] NotTheWheel: yep
[4:14:27] kompany111: If they dont make alts viable SOD will die.
[4:14:29] RueRunsIt: remake hyjal
[4:14:32] szble: yeah
[4:14:40] Jelerman: hey man whats the name of your boxer microphone
[4:14:43] saund: We will be beta testers and be OK with it
[4:14:44] suddenarthritis4: @Shreddingly from all the retail players ive seen i think its also making an older mmo more desirable to modern players
[4:14:45] therealthracian: i think sod can last for yrs
[4:14:48] Metaphix: im so interested to see what they do after 60
[4:14:52] plasmatwice: Basically, does it sell subs? If yes, it's worth developing
[4:14:54] nebby1122233: WTF WHAT HAPPENS TO MY CHAR
[4:14:56] big_stape_: check the talent trees!!
[4:14:56] brenndannn: eh maybe, but i think it would still reset all our current progress
[4:14:57] nebby1122233: I NO LIFED ON
[4:14:57] fartguyl: WoW 2 that never turns into retail
[4:14:58] nebby1122233: ITS OGRE
[4:15:00] Shreddingly: @juiced96 fair correction but my point still stands. It basically introduces alot of skills that originally was available in later versions of the game. Not in classic
[4:15:03] sighwarlock: i think the vast majority really enjoy sod
[4:15:04] NotTheWheel: So SoD has the potential to maybe be classic  + but we aren't there yet
[4:15:06] Jelerman: or chat whats this boxer commentary mic called :D
[4:15:07] jordano111: wow randomizer
[4:15:08] snake_like: the point of making us wait is making it like mini expansion releases. they get to turn old dungeons into raid experiences. what's to understand
[4:15:18] kheap_: i think the lvl 60 content is where its gonna shine
[4:15:19] Mind_G0bl1n: cata KEKW
[4:15:19] Ervill1: report: fkdhsjfdkf
[4:15:38] chadworld77: staysafe as a dad of two im having a blast in SoD. i still have so much shit to do
[4:15:41] suddenarthritis4: OMEGALUL
[4:15:44] Aumua: ?
[4:15:45] juiced96: lmao
[4:15:46] Ervill1: TheIlluminati TheIlluminati
[4:15:50] suddenarthritis4: coordinates all f'd up
[4:15:51] chadworld77: and i think its gonna be even better at 60. just this father's two cents
[4:15:53] hart_mk1: bug report!
[4:16:02] lolsizzle: the dungeons were awesome in cata from memory
[4:16:03] Ervill1: PAyo would get lost for sure
[4:16:14] suddenarthritis4: did you use the uprezzed graphics?
[4:16:16] kompany111: Any chance you can look at my question from earlier about what you would do when we are 60. not a copy pasta monster
[4:16:19] electric_f33l: PauseChamp
[4:16:21] liceol: time for mcdonalds?
[4:16:24] l0ud_h0use: What does the talent tree look like?
[4:16:27] keyboardwarrior32: staysafe as a dad of 0 I got max lvl day 2 of phase 2 release and now im raid logging until phase 3
[4:16:33] suddenarthritis4: the toggle
[4:16:34] suddenarthritis4: new!
[4:16:36] Bronloch: i think tons of casuals are still grinding to 40 LUL
[4:16:40] TrueSmugg: there's a toggle box
[4:16:46] hart_mk1: you didn't check the uprezzed option
[4:16:52] suddenarthritis4: below texture resolution
[4:16:59] ouudelali: stayface look like Macaulay Culkin and Ryan
[4:17:00] lolsizzle: client restart
[4:17:00] yuckil: that orgrimmar redesign tho
[4:17:03] Muaytitus: aint shit changing lol
[4:17:07] ouudelali: Gosling brother combined
[4:17:17] TurboBased: PauseChamp
[4:17:21] suddenarthritis4: PauseChamp
[4:17:30] therealthracian: damn
[4:17:30] chadworld77: to your greater point though, i honestly just dont know if there is really enough demand for classic+ to justify pivoting resources
[4:17:32] therealthracian: that login screen
[4:17:33] therealthracian: is pog
[4:17:34] privatorius: can you check out the talent tree?
[4:17:35] Ervill1: @keyboardwarrior32 okay but how many wives?
[4:17:40] ouudelali: 6
[4:17:47] SepeIio: Peggers
[4:17:48] saund: Yea
[4:17:49] NotTheWheel: :0
[4:17:49] Mind_G0bl1n: it does POG
[4:17:51] TurboBased: Peggers
[4:18:00] Aumua: sure i guess
[4:18:01] therealthracian: looks ilike classic
[4:18:01] saberful: damn thats way better
[4:18:01] Voidbonx: almost real
[4:18:04] saberful: looks nice
[4:18:06] mindsets_tv: ctrl + R
[4:18:09] Ervill1: Wow looks so good, more realistic than New World
[4:18:10] sighwarlock: are you IRL streaming
[4:18:10] Mind_G0bl1n: so realistic now
[4:18:10] juiced96: thought its unreal engine for a second...
[4:18:15] rocknsake: if you pull up SoD and go to the same area, and tab back and forth, you'll see a big difference
[4:18:20] lolsizzle: looks like you're losing frames
[4:18:29] EzPickenz1: its still 1080p lol
[4:18:30] Voidbonx: crazy crisp shadow
[4:18:33] ticklemextreme: ya it is a big difference
[4:18:33] snake_like: moon2PAIN I've killed thermaplugg 9 times and still need 4 pieces of loot before I can raidlog
[4:18:34] rinohwow: fps dropped for sure LUL
[4:18:39] rbo2992: have you found any runes yet?
[4:18:47] Voidbonx: ded gaem
[4:18:48] NotTheWheel: fox only?
[4:18:50] jordano111: scratching my neck like a crackhead getting a nostalgia hit from IF

[4:19:00] TurboBased: EZ Market cornered.
[4:19:00] trebolz: ?
[4:19:03] Aumua: oil prince pls
[4:19:08] sighwarlock: possibly
[4:19:09] Ervill1: who? your voidwalker?
[4:19:10] electric_f33l: EZ
[4:19:17] Playermodd: why do you think Blizzard doesn't take the osrs approach with classic? seems like they are leaving alot on the table
[4:19:20] CookieClickerLegend: world first level 10?
[4:19:21] chadworld77: we are selling fair market value tigerseye to willing buyers
[4:19:26] NotTheWheel: That's an exclusive Staysafe Tigerseye that he had in his inventory
[4:19:38] NotTheWheel: You don't need guilds in Cata it's fine
[4:19:44] nastiku: guilds arent disabled, you're not in one
[4:19:45] dustydollars2121: cata deadge
[4:19:47] electric_f33l: KEKW

[5:06:06] DevilxHeart: im thinking
[5:06:07] osopolar1977: actual pictures
[5:06:08] avoidedneXt: it being real and it not being real has the same value
[5:06:11] r0ger_this: that mud tech cant be any good it doesnt even come in 4k
[5:06:16] GamesVonJames: Alodar is trying to get a "Fresh" experience on Grobbulus Classic Era, pretty much a dead server
[5:06:16] Mind_G0bl1n: how else do you explain pyramids all over the world creating tectonic energy
[5:06:16] Metaphix: tartar sauce survived the great flood
[5:06:21] Daximus_: ^
[5:06:27] osopolar1977: Those Mongolians where advanced
[5:06:30] therealthracian: imagine cantcontrol pet
[5:06:32] HotFlatDietPepsi: It's DLC
[5:06:36] Ervill1: pet control is unlocked in Oribos

[5:08:26] person1029492: worse YEP
[5:08:28] rinohwow: no loch LUL
[5:08:28] neimac2: this cata ptr?
[5:08:30] Daximus_: the architecture PepeHands
[5:08:31] rinohwow: just modan
[5:08:32] aBradAbroad: can you run the voiceover addon so we can listen to the lore? @StaysafeTV
[5:08:46] Quillmane: someone pulled the plug in loch modan
[5:08:58] johnnyhopkinwead1: balls im late
[5:09:15] Metaphix: how do you think raids will work in sod at 60 all at once? @StaysafeTV
[5:09:19] snake_like: I'm here for the boomkin shitshow raids with takashi and crackerzac
[5:09:33] drizzly_bear: chat can anyone play the cata PTR?
[5:09:33] Metaphix: oh cool
[5:09:34] drizzly_bear: or no
[5:09:46] Ervill1: @drizzly_bear no
[5:09:51] chadworld77: i am a molten core truther, it should be 40
[5:09:58] hart_mk1: do you think it's a mistake to phase the lvl 60 raids?
[5:09:58] dirbagdan: 40!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[5:10:01] HotFlatDietPepsi: Make them all 80 Madge
[5:10:10] Shredmuffn: BabyRage no changes
[5:10:24] chadworld77: not trolling why play this if it's capped at 60???
[5:10:31] fuchai: if they make them 20 they can tune them more to make them more of a challenge
[5:10:35] HotFlatDietPepsi: I want my entire screen filled with raid frames Madge
[5:10:37] fuchai: as well as add new mechanics
[5:10:45] 1cyveins: @chadworld77 ur trolling
[5:10:49] ThisGuyisLocal: MC 40 would be so faceroll with runes
[5:10:49] juiced96: mc40 is perfectly tuned for 20 people pepeLaugh
[5:11:08] mentr0g: no one wants challenging raids
[5:11:14] hart_mk1: i don't think size matters in that regard...
[5:11:15] thebedshow: They could add even more with 40 lol
[5:11:20] fuchai: retail has shown the larger raid size the harder it becomes
[5:11:24] DragossNA: hi how i launch cata??
[5:11:26] fuchai: also all this is according to blizz
[5:11:27] snake_like: I just hope they get real weird with later phases. where else can they do it? they have to be safe in retail
[5:11:28] QuestFor420: 1000000%
[5:11:28] chadworld77: correct
[5:11:29] HotFlatDietPepsi: true
[5:11:29] person1029492: im seeing like half or more of people want smaller raids, it sucks that its that popular
[5:11:32] chadworld77: yes
[5:11:33] drizzly_bear: AngelThump
[5:11:34] juiced96: they can do it for 40man but then dad gamers will never clear anything lol
[5:11:39] Daximus_: but they're a small indie company! Think of their limited resources!
[5:11:40] Shredmuffn: @DragossNA closed beta
[5:11:41] therealthracian: 40 men are more fun imo
[5:11:47] avoidedneXt: People unironically stop raiding after MC on regular classic, finding 40 people is always struggle for most guilds
[5:11:48] Somchi: i think it comes down to the size of the dev team on this lol
[5:11:48] HotFlatDietPepsi: imagine how many crackerzacs and tekashis you can find in a 40 man
[5:11:49] QuestFor420: sound like heaven
[5:11:50] dirbagdan: so BASED
[5:11:51] Just_Django: 40 is too many, no one is able to talk
[5:11:58] mentr0g: BASED
[5:12:01] chadworld77: it actually makes me so mad that a majority want the 20 mans
[5:12:01] Zezlo: is that a gun cabinet behind you?
[5:12:03] chadworld77: its so fucking dumb
[5:12:06] umphries: 40 man raids are amazing but for sod.. going to be hard for alot of guilds to fill out a raid without pugging
[5:12:09] dirbagdan: My life is challenging enough I play wow to have fun LUL
[5:12:13] hart_mk1: exactly, go play retail if you want a challenge, SoD is for the classic community
[5:12:19] Kattaaah: @dirbagdan truuuue
[5:12:19] neimac2: even if they are hard they will tune them down cuz of people
[5:12:20] NotTheWheel: I love a game that stomps my balls and spits on my face Kreygasm
[5:12:31] fuchai: yea 40man raids for non streamers is tough to fill
[5:12:31] chadworld77: i play classic because im BAD at wow lol
[5:12:39] avoidedneXt: im fine with that
[5:12:39] snake_like: yeah getting together with friends and rubbing a few braincells together to finish a raid is peak
[5:12:41] HotFlatDietPepsi: But my parses!
[5:12:45] HotFlatDietPepsi: Kappa
[5:12:46] Vecth: Meet in the middle and make it a 29 man raid
[5:12:47] Sowiloo: I am a god gamer
[5:12:48] CommonTeal: I'm not playing SoD as much anymore because raid difficulty BASEDRETARD
[5:12:51] osopolar1977: :( :( :(
[5:12:55] golganarr: no it fits the narrative to say I am a good gamer and my character auto attacks not missing is hard gameplay
[5:12:59] NeppsVT: classic wow aint hard for shit
[5:13:00] nssb89034236: Too hard to put the group together with that many ppl wasn't that the reason?
[5:13:02] NotTheWheel: rather just chill with people
[5:13:04] rinohwow: @CommonTeal LUL
[5:13:14] chadworld77: its so dope to just storm the fuck out of MC and not be panicking because i didnt press my 15th button
[5:13:15] Ervill1: man you ruined for the 99 parsers who thought they were impressive gamers
[5:13:20] umphries: yeah non streamer guilds wont be able to get 40 people online at once, just how it is now a days. I suspect that is part of why theyre making them 20 mans
[5:13:23] Shuttlelol: @CommonTeal this is hilarious LMAO
[5:13:24] osopolar1977: what a motivator lol
[5:13:24] HexxanTV: is this cata though?
[5:13:24] Metaphix: i love the chill vibes of classic wow where its not so sweaty
[5:13:27] hart_mk1: @StaysafeTV a lot of ppl say it's too hard to form 40man raids and say it's easier for streamers
[5:13:29] Daximus_: most of us busy improving irl parses, no pixel parsing brain for me
[5:13:30] MerVidiuM: Good morning from Sweden, its 06:35, 9th Mars here. I hope you have a nice night. PrideRise
[5:13:44] dirbagdan: False
[5:13:45] Metaphix: worked in classic
[5:13:46] Sal_con: Sal_con subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! wow is the hardest game ever idc what u say i need tell myself this before i go to sleep everynight
[5:13:46] chadworld77: false
[5:13:46] lemonchilllll: lost pilot at the north bunker, you kill the white bear etc
[5:13:48] tenwick: LOL
[5:13:50] chadworld77: there are SO Many people playing right now
[5:13:52] avoidedneXt: After MC dude, getting 40 people is hard
[5:13:52] Voidbonx: no friend andy LUL
[5:13:52] edmnd69: that is incredibkly false
[5:13:52] AlwaysTapLast: this guy never played original classic release
[5:13:55] juiced96: @Daximus_ ye can only do one of those
[5:13:57] osopolar1977: kekw
[5:13:57] HexxanTV: damn thats sick should be playing goblin or worgen!
[5:13:58] Ervill1: damn streamers
[5:13:58] snake_like: SCHIZO STREAMERS IN MY WALLS
[5:13:59] Frayeen: here we go again gray parsers talking shit about 99 logs
[5:14:03] avoidedneXt: Yeah but no-one is raiding BWL/AQ/NAXX
[5:14:04] QuestFor420: chat is delusional
[5:14:06] dirbagdan: Not even
[5:14:09] person1029492: yeah, back in 2004-06, no one ever raided cuz they didnt have streamers yet YEP
[5:14:15] dirbagdan: It's like people never made guilds before streamers?
[5:14:17] AlwaysTapLast: you could make full 40 man pugs as a non streamer
[5:14:18] avoidedneXt: Nah after MC theres massive drop off
[5:14:19] jordano111: actively not healthily
[5:14:20] therealthracian: era still exists lol
[5:14:20] osopolar1977: 😹
[5:14:22] tenwick: CLASSIC ERA TODAY LOL
[5:14:26] Jurpi: people are still raiding 40 mans on era servers lol
[5:14:26] fuchai: do you think the same amount of people are playign SoD as they did classic?
[5:14:27] dirbagdan: @person1029492 Exactly lol
[5:14:29] Shuttlelol: bidens warcraft Sadge
[5:14:30] chadworld77: era has 16k people rn
[5:14:31] notgridles: can you talk about bohemian grove??
[5:14:32] Ervill1: streamers are the reason MySpace fell off, I hate these guys
[5:14:32] chadworld77: its nuts
[5:14:36] mentr0g: oh no i have to find a guild
[5:14:38] osopolar1977: Mandela effect
[5:14:40] hart_mk1: i didn't play classic, i only started in SL and started classic in the last month so idk
[5:14:41] CasualCooky: The AU SOD guild i'm in is full and has an alt guild don't think we'll have to much trouble getting enough for 40 man
[5:14:42] therealthracian: login to era
[5:14:43] therealthracian: go to city
[5:14:51] therealdankmoody: Speed running naxx was streamer only Kappa
[5:14:52] snake_like: "they couldn't make that movie in 2024" coded retarded ass message
[5:14:57] Metaphix: i really wish they'd make a new classic era server
[5:14:58] johnnyhopkinwead1: problem is i want to have fun playing the game, not have to plan playing the game like its a second job
[5:14:59] chadworld77: i literally was just watching somebody raid in era a second ago
[5:15:01] dirbagdan: If there was a classic fresh right now, it would be fucking PAAAAAACKED
[5:15:03] illidabbin: wait cata is out now?
[5:15:11] Kattaaah: ERA IS POPPIN' PogU
[5:15:22] notgridles: can you talk about bohemian grove?? @StaysafeTV
[5:15:24] avoidedneXt: again, after MC its really hard
[5:15:25] hart_mk1: @dirbagdan there is a classic fresh, it's SoD :)
[5:15:27] NotTheWheel: Nobody has the time... wipes for 3 hours in a mythic makes no progress
[5:15:29] NotTheWheel: Fun
[5:15:32] johnnyhopkinwead1: they can be done but who tf wants to be bothered with that much shit just to play a video game
[5:15:32] livesinyourmom: it
[5:15:33] dirbagdan: @hart_mk1 :(
[5:15:34] jordano111: maybe in trumps america
[5:15:38] therealthracian: why
[5:15:39] Daximus_: KEKL @NotTheWheel
[5:15:40] schmo4: CTE
[5:15:42] avoidedneXt: hes just on drugs
[5:15:43] EmanuShow: I miss everquest 72 man raids :D
[5:15:46] juiced96: aint nobody wanna deal with recruiting nonstop and organizing that shitshow
[5:15:47] Sowiloo: soul link is gone in cata?

[7:02:45] CadiaStandsTV: It's not like you NEED the beta to play cata if you know what I mean

[7:04:56] Finster27: cata is hot garbage
[7:05:02] bald_n_gorgeous: @andypandynz yeah, you're pretty much limited to speed runs for that. I hear ya
[7:05:13] EmanuShow: First time nostalgia okay :D
[7:05:19] Metaphix: it kinda did, zones spread way out
[7:05:23] Metaphix: vashjir DansGame
[7:05:30] healmore49: I liked cata tbh
[7:05:34] Nytsongx: dungeon grinding is always the meta...
[7:05:34] Shredmuffn: always is
[7:05:37] EmanuShow: God i need food
[7:05:38] person1029492: i hated Uldum so much, Hyjal was fine
[7:05:40] onkeliltis: it was brutal...
[7:05:42] bald_n_gorgeous: I remember really liking arena in cata, but that's about it.
[7:05:43] impa1nful: but thats pointless cause some of ur early bis gear is locked behind rep
[7:05:44] andypandynz: i wanna see someone in chat say why cata is shit to them instead of seeing cata is dogshit all day
[7:06:04] 1cyveins: I always thought lvl 85 cap was odd
[7:06:05] goeroe3d: Some q lines I remember to be pretty fun though, think it's a disservice to dungeon level especially since it's only a few levels
[7:06:08] scorpx: its over
[7:06:17] onkeliltis: the rep grinding for once
[7:06:20] bald_n_gorgeous: I think SOD is kind of a testing ground for a more formal classic+
[7:06:21] broccoliost: im already really bored of sod
[7:06:22] person1029492: classic plus after SoD COPIUM
[7:06:29] Zezlo: @andypandynz so you're just here to bait an arguement?
[7:06:35] pretty_cool_guy: i think they already blew it on the pacing
[7:06:35] Shuttlelol: SOD p3 40-50 needs the 100% exp buff
[7:06:36] photek_tn: Find out on the next Dragonball!
[7:06:38] andypandynz: @Zezlo you are so dumb holy shit
[7:06:39] scrubknightx: SoD Phase 3 will have two raids. Calling it now

[7:06:53] smordan69: they dont know either
[7:06:55] Sowiloo: fresh servers self found
[7:06:57] graduenz: SoD needs to reset every few months and rotate features
[7:07:01] Finster27: Finster27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! I better resub now in case you decide to quit after playing cata
[7:07:03] Zezlo: @andypandynz yes then is the answer
[7:07:04] Vigo__M: Is Turtle WoW better than SoD?
[7:07:04] OrganikCum: classic wod sod is what im waiting for
[7:07:07] webbers__: @eshonxv retard
[7:07:08] conclava_: im taking off work for the war within
[7:07:08] Shredmuffn: @andypandynz they think all of cata is bad because old world gone and 1 end boss is bad, and mop has pandas so its bad. Superficial judgement not actually looking at gameplay
[7:07:10] onkeliltis: wrath I can see
[7:07:16] bigbup123: hows warlock in cata?
[7:07:19] andypandynz: @Zezlo i dont know how u even came to that conclusion that is beyond mind blowing honestly LUL

[7:26:55] lordextraordinary: best hype raid so far in classic is BWL and Naxx
[7:26:57] grizz430: because everyone min/maxed the fun out of it
[7:27:00] Wrettchh: ulduar was a letdown for me

[7:27:09] D3FT: what?

[7:28:12] johnnyhopkinwead1: its not tho
[7:28:14] Zetherior: All of the classic hype was a nostalgic aspiration from a child that existed 20 years ago and never actually did the content, anyone that did it knew better
[7:28:22] Vannicavus: did you turn on the new amped graphics?
[7:28:23] liceol: on max my game looks the same but 100 less fps
[7:28:24] eshonxv: @DankWizard420 yep maplestory is actually a hidden gem of an mmo, you on hyperion or kronos?
