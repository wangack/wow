[2:03:52] BotKobo: juh savix do we know if he heals when he kills someone who's bruised already
[2:04:01] cutexlol_: @Savix imagine he gets healed through people donating blood... so you have to have the entire server being commited to the kill LUL
[2:04:07] MochiMurloc: You're always up when I'm Sleepo Savii sadcat I'll try better to catch your streams more often

[2:04:28] Parcelazo: thank you peepoCute
[2:04:28] ayvi: bfa
[2:04:30] Savii: @MochiMurloc  akamesPat
[2:04:32] ninetysix: @Savix maybe you should stack 255 blood and dont turn in, and the next event you opt out and try damaging him with blood stacks
[2:04:35] jtstroud: @Savii spam him about it and itll happen eventually KEKW
[2:04:35] Brucewayner: check dm

[2:05:38] cutexlol_: @Savix imagine he gets healed through people donating blood... so you have to have the entire server being commited to the kill LUL sorry for copy pasta
[2:05:46] khaste_G: horde frenn alliance
[2:05:47] MalachiteHotS: U think maybe the boss healed because other bozos near him didn't have the buff? LULW
[2:05:50] Buzz_Killingston: you think it takes the whole server to kill it?
[2:05:53] 209tomcat: you would need a large horde streamer to organize
[2:05:58] MochiMurloc: DEMONTIME GIMME I smell sacrifices for the blood loa
[2:06:00] JackWithMeat: just make pvp off mode

I’ve worked in restraurants my whole life- sure I haven’t made millions but now as a top level hospitals professional it’s weird that he would double down on not tipping

[5:08:04] MalachiteHotS: assman gold should tip at least 50%, he made his whole career off of people tipping 100% to him LULW

[5:08:37] Cjpriest: resturants should quit being cheap fucks and pay the people what they deserve and get rid of tipping lol
[5:08:38] ScarletPaladin: I think its dumb companies can cut the pay of the employees simply because they can get tips
[5:08:42] MalachiteHotS: ill give u my tip LULW
[5:08:44] hempstuff: I only tip if a service is rendered. I'm NOT going to tip a gas station clerk for ringing me up
[5:08:45] JimmyGGS: tipping culture is dumb, the enforcing part of it is what I really don't like
[5:08:47] wreckstormx: EU GIGA
[5:08:48] StripSniper: Its not tipping if its mandatory...
[5:08:51] dansto10: why should you pay for your food and also tip pay for the employees wages? what kind of logic is that ?

[5:22:16] StripSniper: So he has total of around 25 mil hp, with healing maybe around 30-35, raid of 80 doing 300 average dps can do 1.4 mill a minute, so it is possible to kill it if noone griefs ofc peepoNerd
[5:22:20] Hotform: he heals 1000 for every person when he does blood leech, having so many people + lag made the dps check harder than having a small raid

[5:22:26] Uzziah56: Hmmm @Savix some people were saying taht at 20% hp he gets health based off how many people he killed
[5:22:30] Esoterikk: His health increases by X% for every ear he has multiplicative, so just plug like 10% into his base health and increase it by 10% then do it again 255 times and it works out
[5:22:31] chelli93: @savix whats the addon or weakaura for exorcism proc?
