[4:32:45] AwokenTarHaar: It's boss backpedal and melee being under the hitbox
[4:32:45] ogsplashgods: ur going to have to unbind it LUL
[4:32:47] The_Faceless_Void: but not like that
[4:32:49] clillebk: it is the jumping

[4:33:13] CWORDPASS: It is the jump, happened to us during real wotlk back in the day
[4:33:18] myako_owo: oo, looks quite the same
[4:33:19] izzy777: just do slow, consistent back steps, and yea, don't jump. I've had that happen once before, jumping right after back-stepping put me sort of into his model and made him turn
[4:33:21] jotanie: you might be moving too far from the boss right?

[4:33:31] aposynthesis: @LilTaisu OPie
[4:33:31] ogsplashgods: Hmm for science
[4:33:31] Rockyside1: ye jumping works on leotheras the blind
[4:33:35] LilPorkys_ttv: i think it has something to do with range like furthest or closest tank or 2nd aggro?
[4:33:35] Baronic: am i forgiven for questioniong 2004 game ?
[4:33:37] Alias2552: Wouldnt surprise me if jumping was the cause
[4:33:39] Seidre: 4Head
[4:33:40] HotHotHeals: levitate bro
[4:33:50] clillebk: its wow what u expect LUL
[4:33:51] just9n: this game was built in 2014
[4:33:54] just9n: i mean
[4:33:56] AwokenTarHaar: @shroud sorry for spam. But melee need to not be under the boss when it backpedals after you move it
[4:33:57] rodic87: he sprays in front of himself, if somehow you're not in front of his hitbox that'd do it
[4:33:59] just9n: 2008, who knows whats wrong wit hit
[4:34:04] just9n: with*
[4:34:05] LieutenantBates: Shut it old man
[4:34:17] rodic87: yeah everything is too grouped up under his hitbox imo
[4:34:20] Seidre: @allawi999x learn how to spell the game
[4:34:23] lolsmileyface666: jumping will fuck you on ground effects

[4:34:35] qbabattoir: monka S
[4:34:36] Ferpectpanda: yeah you gotta backpeddle in intervals, his model is super janky
[4:34:37] axlor: just tell everyone to flask and pot for more dam
[4:34:39] jud0sku: if you move back enough to get the boss moving forward then walk into it, the boss steps back more than you, so melee also needs to not get too close and be max range
[4:34:39] NTguilty25: dont do it D:
[4:34:43] CWORDPASS: when i tanked this i always backpeddal like a noob. always works
[4:34:46] rodic87: yeah you gotta just slow S every 5-8 seconds for a solid 2 seconds
[4:34:47] mitzel36: Back pedal is BIG BRAIN
[4:34:48] faintdeath: Alot of tanks backpadel on this dude
[4:34:50] jotanie: its when you move outside of melee range
[4:34:56] nightknightv1: this game needs to update graphics
[4:35:01] Seidre: back pedal it i think thats how we cleared
[4:35:01] Bardiyo: any 1 know what is his ui using?
[4:35:06] just9n: that probably is it when u jump outside of melee range

[4:38:27] rodic87: @cwordpass agreed.
[4:38:29] lolsmileyface666: tanks and even some melee really can benefit from backpeddle, there was just a noob stigma around it from early wow

[4:39:32] MessengerDogger: what server is he on?
[4:39:35] rodic87: confirmed - backpedal vs jumping  and dancing, who'd think dancing wasn't a tanking strat :D
[4:39:37] manavomit: yeah
[4:39:39] actually707: tanks can backpedal

[4:40:06] legionwraithh: why do people play classic wow?
[4:40:09] SnazzyShanyn: What is the addon that uses the ring to select his auras?
[4:40:13] Ferpectpanda: took blizz a few expansions before they fixed the Ai of mobs to where the border of their attack range was larger... yeah... they... only had to improve the mob's auto range so that stuff wouldn't happen anymore
[4:40:16] eskodas: Dog time
[4:40:22] Vesir_1: its cause the game knows your speed is bigger when strafing thus it makes the boss go faster to catch up, and then realizes you didn't go far, so it resets itself and faces the other way
[4:40:23] pamuj: oh gotcha. just logged on and everyone is playing it again lol guess i missed the news
[4:40:25] Hazno: @legion099 they enjoy it? also nostalgia

[4:40:51] faintdeath: New Health pot @shroud
[4:40:59] Hempademic: @legion099 very different
[4:40:59] rodic87: @legion099 for my part, I had more fun in this expac than others, so I'm happy to revisit. Same reason people play original Mario instead of Mario galaxy or like to drive old cars instead of new cars.

[8:40:03] jacktup: that was harrowing
[8:40:05] iitz_midas: 3 DRAG LETSGO
[8:40:09] Lesterr420: gotta at least try it
[8:40:09] Roonab: three dragons or uninstall
[8:40:12] Hazno: 3d no balls
[8:40:13] MitchDebono: sarth 3d or no balls
[8:40:14] arfoxxx: That gotta come inside the most boring raid list
[8:40:22] SlayerMike718: do they have the dps for 3?
[8:40:23] Dawtx: naxx is boring af
[8:40:30] Lesterr420: always gotta try zerg 3drakes
[8:40:31] Darkfigment: gotta try it once or twice
[8:40:34] Kaiwa: imagine doing 2 drakes only
[8:40:36] emrexbci: For the Alliance :P
[8:40:42] bohan_: guess you arent a twilight vanquisher
[8:40:45] dedrateroserasdom: do wintergrasp
[8:40:56] Theldanis: you can prob do 3d but it will take a whole day of trying i guess
[8:41:01] Kaiwa: did they buff drakes? or nerf zerg strat?
[8:41:02] Jaxthrax2151: it is not only pvp
[8:41:23] Lesterr420: @theldanis not even it's actually super easy it's just a dps check
[8:41:37] rDaniiTV: is it hard to get into WOW now?
[8:41:41] Theldanis: @Lesterr420 that's exactly why it will take a long time
[8:41:43] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D

[8:42:23] kennet22: @shroud how do your stats look
[8:42:24] raynarr: three drakes do insane damage to the tank
[8:42:30] KontrolStyle: it's not that bad lol
[8:42:31] Kidritch: yah a bunch of people have done it already
[8:42:32] General_Merk: It's pretty hard early on, free later.
[8:42:41] bohan_: 3D on 25 is easy. 10 man 3D is the hardest fight in phase 1
[8:42:48] patrickstaryo: big waves of lava
[8:42:48] raynarr: its better to use a feral druid with resilence gear to make it so you cant get crit early on and use a disc priest to spam gheal bubble on them
[8:42:50] RedFury6500: shroudButt_TK shroudButt_TK
[8:42:50] MrPaladinGuy: I'd imagine it's been done but after tons and tons of attempts since it's purely a dps check

[8:43:01] ProfessorChaoos: I doubt many of us have even tried the double buffed version
[8:43:20] SlayerMike718: it's mostly a dps check, just equip all the gear u guys got and try
[8:43:26] KontrolStyle: kill the ads
[8:43:26] mcclapperr: @shroud thats crazy ur raiding with ghazzy
[8:43:28] FreddiFish07: its not hard. i did it with my lvling guild all fresh 80s (lie)
