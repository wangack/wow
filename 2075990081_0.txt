[0:23:55] Lolkovec11: @tommykaylive Sup Tomm, how you doing?
[0:23:59] Woody_Mate: I know nothing about starcraft, but what is it that has allowed it to last so long?
[0:24:52] rososus911: @Woody_Mate what it lasted so long ?
[0:25:23] King_Robert_The_Based: @Woody_Mate Same reason as league I'd imagine.
[0:25:30] causin_drama: what does that flying guy do just scout ?
[0:25:52] justintheone_: When kebab sim
[0:26:02] Woody_Mate: @rososus911 Yeah like it seems like most games like this died out during that time.  C&C, dawn of war etc
[0:26:13] aceofhearts1231: @causin_drama i think you need them to make more units
[0:26:34] rososus911: @causin_drama its your supply, more you have of them the more army you can build
[0:26:48] Woody_Mate: @King_Robert_The_Based yeah fair, good point

[0:28:09] King_Robert_The_Based: @Woody_Mate If you want a more detailed answer, I'd say the fun gameplay loop combined with the competition scene being toxic enough to make you wanna do better but not too toxic to turn away its core players.
[0:28:16] rososus911: @Woody_Mate its dying slowly, but its still very replayble

[0:47:29] rososus911: @quatrefake bruh, thats crazy considering every unit in sc2 has a counter to it
[0:48:10] quatrefake: @rososus911 Kappa
[0:49:33] BadEndRuby: I do feel like zergs probably the hardest at least from an outsider pov ahaha
[0:50:05] BadEndRuby: Before I switched to different rts I was protoss mech ball gamer it felt very braindead
[0:50:15] imSubt1e: zerg is hardest at lowerer levels but easier as you go higher and macro better.. injects and creep spread are strong af, if you keep ontop of them perfectly
