[0:26:26] CritcobainTV: towRee
[0:26:32] sil3nt48: mythic + isnt meant to be a source for loot. your major upgrades come from the VAULT. people complaining about the loot drop rates are the same people stuck at 200 ilvl on their mains.
[0:27:03] theoriginalzinng: nah im stuck in that 210-215 range
[0:27:13] sil3nt48: i just broke 217

[0:27:18] theoriginalzinng: relying on one upgrade a week is slow
[0:27:21] Zubberikan: I was telling my friends that when wow became a checklist is when I lost interest. Currently playing classic lol
[0:27:25] gauren999: just had cleaning help, and my pants are broken in the middle where the dick is, so she saw my dick
[0:27:29] mmrghost7: if u think m+ is not source of loot u have not touched legion or even bfa
[0:27:30] gauren999: awkward
[0:27:37] sil3nt48: i was stuck at 211 for 5 weeks, despite clearing heroic weekly and doing 10 mythics a week
[0:27:37] Clay2K_: When Blizzard profits get sent to the maw Kappa
[0:27:38] GiraffeHydra_: @sil3nt48 m+ is certainly supposed to be a source of loot, it was pitched as an alternative to gearing vs raiding
[0:28:02] KingSlayerYotam: i liked bfa more at this point than sl
[0:28:16] sil3nt48: you get 210 ilvl loot for a 15... youre gunna get your upgrades from your vault
[0:28:21] RocketMan23: some shady shit going on in china....color me surprised Kappa
[0:28:24] Armdel: apperantly china has been doing a lot of piloted boosts
[0:28:34] mmrghost7: @KingSlayerYotam yeah me too , but i never tought i would love bfa more than something  :P
[0:28:35] theoriginalzinng: yeah it just feels bad to not get nothing
[0:28:38] sil3nt48: the 210's i have drop are completely useless, they just get vendored. the real draw are the 226 vault pieces.
[0:28:52] CritcobainTV: FeelsBadMan

[0:29:27] rubu: Sounds like a form of cheating.
[0:29:28] grim777777: max said it was him
[0:29:31] GiraffeHydra_: @sil3nt48 that's a numbers issue on blizzards end, I'm pointing out that it is *meant* to be a source of gearing opposed to what you said originally
[0:29:31] lanara233: So it's like boosting but for guilds
[0:29:33] Armdel: its against the tos yes
[0:29:34] Vexxsis: awesome to see wow is nothing but boosting
[0:29:37] CDubTheRIPper: lmao so incoming bans on a bunch of mythic guilds
[0:29:59] CritcobainTV: Clearly they just drank some gfuel and fucked shit up man @Towelliee EZ
[0:30:01] sil3nt48: theyre on chinese servers. they arent getting banned.
[0:30:11] RocketMan23: none of this would be tolerated on US/EU servers, these guilds would be banned so fast your head would spin

[0:30:17] KingSlayerYotam: prob some guilds spent some real money, everything in china revolves around who have more money
[0:30:17] Clicklesly: But nothing there implies playing other people's chars?
[0:30:20] hectabit: i wanna do mythic raids
[0:30:42] mmrghost7: pogs are happy with that
[0:30:54] CritcobainTV: @Clicklesly bro if they had zero mythic raid kills and then suddenly 2 shot the entire raid? lol
[0:31:11] grim777777: they just got lucky at the same time :)
[0:31:15] death_fisted: raiding prodigies
[0:31:34] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee nah bro, they used code Towel and drank some Gfuel and went hard af KEKW
[0:31:40] Zarinna2015: If blizzard does nothing I call BS. They would never let this slide in NA/EU regions. But they a scumbags and won't come down on China.
[0:31:58] sil3nt48: ive heard from sources they charge 60 bucks a character for the mythic clear. 60x20 people, then they split the money
[0:31:59] shadez1: welcome to world we living in @Towelliee
[0:32:00] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee if you flip a coin infinity times, odds are you'll get 100 heads in a row. these guys are the quantum hall of fame theory in action
[0:32:01] KingSlayerYotam: blizz cant do shit about this too, they dont set the rules for china
[0:32:12] sil3nt48: they also require characters to be ilvl 223 i believe

[3:32:34] Ka5h3d: @BlueBlurPrime are you guys able to phase Sire after the 5th cleansing or does it take you until the 6th to phase?
[3:32:39] Warlax_: that boomkin dmg omg
[3:32:56] Jelanipatron: I remember watching you do this fight in the beta. What a night and day difference huh
[3:33:03] micha3lsc0tt: damn holy did more than mage
[3:33:29] Weeaboo__Chad: Do you still log on to FF14?
[3:33:34] Lynxide: Yeah, that pally was doing crazy
[3:33:36] Orcmondo: My man! orcmonMyman orcmonMyman
[3:33:59] Ka5h3d: Yknow for a fire mage that mage isn't doing much  DPS
[3:34:01] Holysal: yeah hpally does alot especially if venthyr
[3:34:19] BlueBlurPrime: atm still working on getting to phase 3
[3:35:09] Ka5h3d: @BlueBlurPrime fair enough, but do you have the DPS to phase him  before the 6th cleanse? If you do your guild could easily do 10s
[3:35:24] Ka5h3d: Just want to get a sense of how geared y'all are
[3:35:27] Qargory: injstant
[3:36:03] Thrillz: only one can be up no matter how many Venthyr
[3:36:17] Qargory: you can pull both in but only control one at a time, so you can keep him attacking you while first one is controlled and then grab 2nd one after
[3:36:31] BlueBlurPrime: havent made it that far but I think we do, most of us are 210 ilvl some are higher
[3:36:57] George2001k: I have been trying to make a timed SD q7 for 2 weeks now....... very sad
[3:36:58] BlackS0L0: @Towelliee Im stoned and retarded, what you doing right now
[3:37:10] Ka5h3d: @BlueBlurPrime Have you made it to phase 2? I'm talking specifically about phase 1
[3:37:11] George2001k: Done the rest on 17 though
[3:38:03] BlueBlurPrime: oh yeah we have made it to phase 2 no problem, when he pulls us all down, hardest part is the last cleansing, to clear that 3rd stack on 2nd group
[3:38:25] BlueBlurPrime: we do 6 cleansing
[3:38:38] GrandmasterBaggz: GrandmasterBaggz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[3:38:39] Ka5h3d: Right so just get him to about 73% by the third ravage and you can push him to phase after the 5th cleansing and just have everyone get hit by that
[3:38:50] dabinsky: 5 cleansing should be your target
[3:38:52] BlueBlurPrime: hmm will suggest taht
[3:38:53] Qargory: aggro in there is annoying as hell yeah
[3:39:01] Lincoln_WoW: they have a fixate
[3:39:10] George2001k: Smooth them
[3:39:10] dabinsky: but you need the dmg for 5
[3:39:13] Ka5h3d: If everyone gets hit by the 5th cleansing but you push him  as the adds hit the ground they won't do any damage, you'll avoid the hunters and the blood price
[3:39:23] Ka5h3d: But yeah you need the damage, if BP happens after the 5th cleanse you're dead
[3:39:27] dimofodi: might be able to sit inbetween if hes quick enough

[5:08:54] Exodeo_: i'm still playing, but very casually
[5:08:54] JohnStocktonsShorts: The reason Iâ€™m not playing yet is because for me thereâ€™s no point until I can get gear I can upgrade
[5:08:55] cbiskit89: @CrimsonNurse he's building up gold and crafting for his paladin
[5:08:58] SilkeySmooth: retaining whats left of the subs.
[5:08:59] Exodeo_: I just can't enjoy SL myself
[5:09:07] DeanoTV: no point until next patch
[5:09:13] CrimsonNurse: @cbiskit89 Oh

[5:10:11] rocthenite: milking them dry
[5:10:14] Holysal: nielsens owns it
[5:10:18] swordwindgaming: running mythics for gear is an asinine choir

[5:26:51] swordwindgaming: naxx 25 was a cool walk in the park, though
[5:26:57] swordwindgaming: original naxx destroyed guilds
[5:27:04] Lincoln_WoW: naxx 25 is a bastardized version of one of the best raids of all time
[5:27:11] swordwindgaming: original naxx ruined friendships
[5:27:28] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah that's true
[5:27:31] rocthenite: preah top raids didn't even put naxx 25 on the list of worst, it was awful

[5:37:48] swordwindgaming: I think that would permanently damage the brand if they give Shadowlands the WoD treatment.
[5:38:02] swordwindgaming: Its bad enough that SL didn't live up to the hype.
[5:38:04] Lincoln_WoW: they seem in the ideation phase on how to expand soulbinds and shit. they have no idea what will be in the patch outside of the zone updates
[5:38:12] theszoti: that could do some mortal damage to wow
[5:38:20] Cal_Kat: gave the gfuel a try lived it so far... but ya gotta get u wanna them starter packs with ur logo man SMOrc

[5:40:18] anithics: is g fuel any different then the standard black coffee?
[5:40:32] Mecabeast: rules of classic you pull it you tank it
[5:40:34] Shrenko: @anithics got tons of vitamins in it
[5:40:35] dcmaniac11: Do you think TBC players will reach in content within two to three weeks?
[5:40:52] anithics: of thats whats up @Shrenko
[5:40:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: oh you sold me at mango
[5:40:57] anithics: oh**
[5:41:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: the doom demonaid is much spicier

[5:41:28] WallyJustice: Classic gameplay 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 1
[5:41:30] Azmaveth_Gaming: Yeah, I like the Demonade.
[5:41:34] LandoGriffinPHD: Really canada post backed up? NO, NEVER HAPPENS
[5:41:36] Azmaveth_Gaming: That's the Doom one.
[5:41:37] LandoGriffinPHD: xD
[5:42:14] metavahn231: 3-4 buttons sounds like retail tbh
[5:42:27] Shrenko: towPog
[5:42:33] venomizedcarnage: takes about a month to get mine and Im north of toronto
[5:42:54] Cal_Kat: mine took 2 days hehe
[5:43:11] warejax101: How long would a holypriest be expecting to level in classic? Would one be able to get to 60 before TBC launch?
[5:43:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: @Towelliee did you ever raid with Esfand?
[5:43:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: i level my alts with rest xp only
[5:43:59] vexingrose0: What's the best way to not get burnt out on this game? I've been playing off and on since Mists but can't seem to keep it going for more than 6 months at a time.
[5:44:03] Xarellius: wandpriest is pretty fast, almost no downtime @warejax101
[5:44:03] Exodeo_: I think I may start lvling in classic too tbh, nothing to do in SL anyway
[5:44:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: couple levels every 2 weeks
[5:44:12] Cramer: if blizzard waits until August that would be insane
[5:44:17] Red_Dead_Redeem: ah that makes sense LUL
[5:44:25] Gortan: thought tbc was may
[5:44:28] Red_Dead_Redeem: duh, I'm a dumbo lol
[5:44:55] blackghost41: blackghost41 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 87 months, currently on a 87 month streak! 
[5:45:12] Red_Dead_Redeem: didn't they say that august was planned release for TBC?
[5:45:18] Cramer: I'd be mad if it was in August
[5:45:24] Lincoln_WoW: TBC will come out after 9.1 so Aug/Sept makes sense to me
[5:45:34] Lokajin: Nothing has been said as a release window for TBC @Redemption004
[5:45:37] Cal_Kat: beta in may maybe
[5:45:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: blizz has not commented on a date in any form
[5:45:45] Wildside1177: I hope that a lot of the prep work for classic will also speed up TBC. If it does it might be soon. If not then who knows.
[5:45:53] Lokajin: They literally said TBC 2021 and that was it
[5:45:55] Red_Dead_Redeem: it's a wait and see, we will string you along lol
[5:46:00] Lokajin: meaning theres a 9 month window for that
[5:46:01] snuffles_80: oct/nov is my guess for tbc :)
[5:46:04] Plague_GG: 9.1 in august towCry
[5:46:05] Suzaku1011: August/Sept makes the most sense... do a summer release of 9.1 and then jump into Classic
[5:46:16] trustthejust1: Arent mages supposd to out dps the tank?
[5:46:21] AnotherNatone: AnotherNatone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hammers Up!
[5:46:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: August makes sense for TBC
[5:46:31] Red_Dead_Redeem: maybe early sept

[5:46:44] Cramer: Making the classic community farm naxx for 10 months would hemorrhage subscriptions
[5:46:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: #NoChanges Kappa
[5:47:20] we_are_whomp: i mean look at every expansion after bc
[5:47:27] we_are_whomp: there's always been a long lul
[5:47:30] we_are_whomp: sometimes over a year
[5:47:34] WhataboutZoidberg: i came back to CLassic to farm til TBC, so im back during the "drought"
[5:47:50] WhataboutZoidberg: its so casual and stress free atm
[5:47:51] Suzaku1011: Nax came out Dec last year so MAYBE they push TBC to end of year to give Naxx a full year but that's a but much.. 9 months seem more appropriate which puts it in line with August
[5:47:53] SamULJackson: farming a raid for 10 months? SoO would like to have a word 4Head
[5:47:55] Red_Dead_Redeem: Blizzard wanting to hold on to the subs with there " Wait but there's more" Mentality LUL
[5:48:03] Red_Dead_Redeem: *their
[5:48:09] we_are_whomp: i mean shit even icc was almost a year
[5:48:15] we_are_whomp: soo was like 16 months
[5:48:17] Wildside1177: 0.3% of the population saw the original Naxx.
[5:48:22] Suzaku1011: Dragon Soul would like your Soul
[5:48:25] Lincoln_WoW: dragon soul yikes
[5:48:26] ryanc1124: at least SoO was fun!
[5:48:26] Lokajin: there hasnt been a single major raid in vanilla so far that lasted longer then 4 months.

[5:48:47] Mecabeast: we got what 8mos for nylotha?
[5:48:55] zerocemeriss: yea but the content for the next classic expansion is already done they just need to tweek it for the new systems

[5:49:06] we_are_whomp: which again is normal for other raids in previous expansions
[5:49:08] Lincoln_WoW: 11 months (Jan to November)
[5:49:09] we_are_whomp: except for end raids
[5:49:14] we_are_whomp: 4-5 months is average
[5:49:32] Red_Dead_Redeem: how's the healing coming along @Towelliee
[5:49:40] CardinalTX: What will be least played class in TBC?
[5:50:03] Lokajin: I personally think its a mistake to compare releasing classic content to the release of a new expansion. One requires fresh development of new assets, coding, mechanics, etc. The other all that work is already done the development needs of the project are significantly less.
[5:50:14] metavahn231: blizzard is a indie company?
[5:50:28] metavahn231: they sure act like it
[5:50:35] Red_Dead_Redeem: small indie company
[5:51:01] CardinalTX: We need New World to be great when it does launch
[5:51:06] MrTrebs: it's classic, what DOESNT feel sluggish
[5:51:13] we_are_whomp: it was 2 yrs from when classic was announced to when it was released. lol what
[5:51:18] we_are_whomp: ok man
[5:51:37] warejax101: I mean, bears *don't* have thumbs, really.
[5:51:40] Mecabeast: I predict June 9.1 and Sept tbc to coincide with business quarters
[5:51:40] metavahn231: the hybrid tax was very real in classic
[5:51:46] Drizz_36: new world PepeLaugh
[5:52:21] SamULJackson: if you release an MMO at the same time a wow expac drops you deserve to flop
[5:52:24] metavahn231: new world just isnt a MMO to me, feels more like ARK
[5:52:28] Shrenko: delay number 14
[5:52:32] warejax101: This is probably *the* worst time for a new MMO to be launching, with 9.1 and fucking TBC dropping.
[5:52:50] CardinalTX: If they are smart they will plan for that
[5:53:12] DewWut: instanced dungeons sold it for me honestly, thats what was missing for me
[5:53:22] khakifry: @Towelliee after what happened with Cyberpunk, Amazon would be retarded to release an incomplete game imo
[5:53:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: phase 2 in october Kappa delay it again LUL
[5:53:47] 3dRes: @khakifry Amazon's Crucible would like a word with you
[5:54:00] apollobaker: Isnt BC coming out in may?
[5:54:16] khakifry: @3dRes very good point... but that was before Cyberpunk
[5:54:37] Drizz_36: there is no release date for TBC classic yet
[5:54:49] 3dRes: @khakifry i agree, and hopefully they have learned from that massive mistake
[5:54:58] metavahn231: cyberpunk made so much money do to mindless fanboy's that i doubt they even care if its unfinished or not, thats the early access culture
[5:55:29] Cramer: resists
[5:55:31] Cramer: from level
[5:55:34] apollobaker: @drizz_36 but the leaks say may,no?
[5:55:34] MrTrebs: @Veramer most everyone cared that it was unfinished though
[5:55:45] halfug: was it annunced that u can boost one character to 58 before tbc?
[5:56:15] metavahn231: just give it 2 years and the brainfoged gamers will forget all about CP and buy their next game
[5:56:30] Drizz_36: @fan_of_dan eh, i don't trust the leaks very much but it's certainly possible. i think they would have announced a may release date by now since it's only two months away
[5:56:30] cweb_: The tabard was white when it dropped for me a few days ago. Wasn't it originally a green?
[5:56:39] Hawkzerr: Can horde use the boost on Paladin?
[5:56:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: no
[5:56:47] we_are_whomp: you'll get stomped in cathedral
[5:56:51] we_are_whomp: mobs are 37-42
[5:56:52] Wildside1177: Whitemane might eat your face.
[5:56:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: blood elf and draeini can not be boosted

[5:59:08] Maydie6066: @Towelliee what level would you say is worth paying for a server transfer?
[5:59:12] Maydie6066: for classic
[5:59:51] Shrenko: heeell no
[5:59:58] warejax101: No, not possible at all, haha.
[6:00:08] bobbyBRASH: How does @Towelliee know that TBC Beta is SOON?
[6:00:08] Frank4LuLz: todays wow is easy kill fest
[6:00:12] Frank4LuLz: 40
[6:00:17] TheGaoSora: It'll be off xpac farming heaven
[6:00:18] Frank4LuLz: or 45
[6:00:28] Frank4LuLz: 45 to 55 grind sucks
[6:00:31] SilkeySmooth: just pay for a boost when classic tbc launches
[6:00:31] parmesanchi: Ya i would say 40 is probably a good point of no return of wanting to server transfer lol
[6:00:40] Jeffblute88: at what level
[6:00:44] Jeffblute88: like toon level
[6:00:47] CritcobainTV: hes saying what level should he be before transferring
[6:00:48] Maydie6066: @Towelliee as in assuming you werent 60, what would be the lowest level that you could say "yeah thats worth it" vs "nah, its easy to level back to there"
[6:00:50] CritcobainTV: or just start over
[6:01:06] jeneraljelly: It depends how much you value your time
[6:01:10] Hawkzerr: Agreed 40+
[6:01:18] Jeffblute88: I would say that is relative to your game time
[6:01:38] jeneraljelly: if you play 10 hours a day you can just re lelve no problem.. if you play 2 hours a day might be worth transferring
[6:02:05] CritcobainTV: @Maydie6066 that changes based on each person. some people can get to 40 in a couple days easily, others it takes a couple weeks
[6:02:08] frassin: frassin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 80 months! 
[6:02:21] Plague_GG: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:02:33] Hawkzerr: My issue is I made a 60 Ally mage with RL friends and they all quit and we played horde since TBC. Now I wish I could faction change to keep all the rep and stuff.
[6:02:37] thesk3lly: don't you get one free boost with the game purchase?
[6:02:42] jeneraljelly: $60 seems reasonable for the time it takes to level
[6:02:42] zackyton: its gonna be a fat 60
[6:02:47] roflpotamus: LMAO
[6:02:49] Cloudpony: Lawls
[6:02:49] SilkeySmooth: ill pay every penny of that $60 to boost my bm hunter alt
[6:02:54] Frank4LuLz: Find a leveling guild, they are everywhere, and do 40, gold, bags, mount, then transfer to a50 50 server, good economy
[6:02:54] Jeffblute88: @Towelliee what a deal! it's almost a dollar a level!

[6:03:06] Wulfgrym: and you get gear
[6:03:11] pavepawns: 250 dollars :p
[6:03:14] CardinalTX: Fat 60
[6:03:15] CritcobainTV: $500 for lvl 58 Kappa
[6:03:17] Darzetti_: LUL 100$
[6:03:19] Wulfgrym: I say same price as retail
[6:03:21] Cezzan: really? i thought it wouldnt be more than 30 lol
[6:03:22] pavepawns: no i mean i want it to be 100 dollars
[6:03:22] Frank4LuLz: retail is 60, classic will be 60
[6:03:26] MuttonChopins: your life insurance LULW
[6:03:31] Mecabeast: watch you get grey gear
[6:03:33] Spaede: that is too much... but ppl would pay it lol

[6:03:35] Maydie6066: lol you can get a classic boost, BUT you have to sacrifice a toon from retail thats max level....
[6:03:35] keeindordel: $40
[6:03:43] VictorAvalanche: should be way less then retail , 25 30 maybe
[6:03:44] Wulfgrym: makes sense
[6:03:47] armybone1: hey, you want WoLK classic? 100 dollars for boost
[6:04:00] Ogrin: can you boost an blood elf paladin?
[6:04:01] jeneraljelly: Why should it be less then retail when leveling in retail takes a fraction of the time?
[6:04:07] Cezzan: @Ogrin no
[6:04:07] 24nolet82: we should be able to buy the number of level we want for a price
[6:04:08] Mystirose: my question is since it's the same account, could I buy tokens in retail and turn them into Blizzard balance then use that to buy the boost?
[6:04:11] MuttonChopins: nope you cant @Ogrin
[6:04:14] Plague_GG: It takes way more time to hit 60 in classic than retail
[6:04:18] Ogrin: Damn - and thank you chat <3
[6:04:27] Spaede: @Mystirose yes
[6:04:28] SilkeySmooth: id like a wow token in tbc to help cut down on boosting and gold sites
[6:04:41] Plague_GG: towOny
[6:04:46] MuttonChopins: are people against wow tokens in TBC Classic?
[6:05:01] zamboneknee: @Towelliee why no cam
[6:05:06] CritcobainTV: !cam
[6:05:06] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[6:05:08] Mecabeast: the time to cap is irrelevant for expansions it about getting your players to play the expansion content
[6:05:15] Mystirose: so I can literally buy gold in retail to use in TBC classic
[6:05:18] SilkeySmooth: id like 2 years of bc
[6:05:20] parmesanchi: !cam
[6:05:28] CritcobainTV: @Mystirose no?
[6:05:29] Frank4LuLz: youy know they are having meetings evryday about tokens and the money, cheedder coming
[6:05:29] jeneraljelly: 2 years of classic 2 years of TBC probably
[6:05:34] zerocemeriss: a boost is around 40 bucks if u acquire the gold via illegal means
[6:05:34] Vinkster: I think you need more quests in your log.
[6:05:46] zerocemeriss: on most servers u can prolly get to 60 for around 2k
[6:05:57] ogzauce: i cant wait til they rerealease BFA

[6:06:07] SilkeySmooth: bfa was good
[6:06:11] CritcobainTV: @Mystirose well, i mean you could if you just kept putting it to bnet balance, and then used the balance on classic to buy a token maybe? but that seems like a waste cause you're losing money
[6:06:15] Hawkzerr: The only change I want in TBC is ability to find groups better but not adding dungeon finder.
[6:06:17] MuttonChopins: you earn gold in TBC and you buy a sub or blizzard money to buy games and one person buys WoW token for gold @Mystirose
[6:06:32] Wulfgrym: https://www.wowhead.com/news=321239/weekly-valor-cap-starts-at-5000-valor-during-first-week-of-patch-9-0-5

[6:07:02] TheGaoSora: Unfourtunally it makes MB looks legitimate
[6:07:12] Lincoln_WoW: also gives new or returning players a chance to catch up gold wise to people who are gold capped
[6:08:27] Plague_GG: I would be ok with a one-time gold token
[6:08:29] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee you spend 1500
[6:08:31] Lincoln_WoW: you have to spend it
[6:08:33] HawtPepperTuna: Can earn it but uou gotta spend it
[6:08:34] ForklyftTV: you have to spend it
[6:08:36] HEYYOUGUYS__: u gotta spend it
[6:08:37] HawtPepperTuna: *you
[6:08:38] Suzaku1011: get 1500 and spend it
[6:08:38] parmesanchi: You can earn 5k in one week, but can only hold 1500 at one time
[6:08:39] Cezzan: So are you forced to use 1500 valor each time?
[6:08:39] jerexify: Spend it.
[6:08:43] hoyle00: you have to spend within the 1500 but able to get 5000
[6:08:43] SpreedyTV: nope you ned to use et
[6:08:46] Hestert: on your person the capp is 1500 but you can earn 5k
[6:08:46] Cezzan: thats stupid af
[6:08:47] Suzaku1011: spend 1500 x number of times until you hit 5000
[6:08:49] N3_Destro: just like conq you have to spend it
[6:08:50] Lincoln_WoW: yes
[6:08:51] SpreedyTV: yes
[6:08:52] CritcobainTV: yep
[6:09:17] N3_Destro: uou can earn up to 5000 but can only spend and earn 1500 at a time
[6:09:18] CritcobainTV: depends how much it is per ilvl, i assume it goes up like honor system for pvp
[6:09:19] ScytaleTv: 3
[6:09:32] Lincoln_WoW: i want them to make existing 9.0 gear upgadable
[6:09:34] Sandisy: that's so stupid with the low drop rates. cap out at 1500 before you get the items you need to upgrade
[6:09:54] TheGaoSora: yup
[6:09:54] hectabit: pretty much
[6:10:01] Lokajin: im fine with that to be fair
[6:10:01] Suzaku1011: Is valor account wide or?
[6:10:03] fistofnature: Its not what we used to have back in wrath / cata @Towelliee
[6:10:05] Plague_GG: make it the OG valor system
[6:10:08] jeneraljelly: blizz seems clueless :(
[6:10:13] ForklyftTV: timing all 10's and 15's is something most casuals wont/cant do
[6:10:16] MuttonChopins: too much philosophy thinking
[6:10:20] SilkeySmooth: high end m+ already have the groups to run their alts through this helps them more
[6:10:40] ArcaneSyntax: this is why i was kind of against using valor in the first place.
[6:10:44] Sandisy: everything they do just scream increase mau stats. there's just no other reason that makes sense
[6:10:46] Mecabeast: get rid of the 1500 character cap and it'd be fine. no one wants to grind d all week for a few upgrades then farm more for a few more upgrades. just let me grind the 5k and send all 5k at one time.
[6:10:50] TheGaoSora: They already alienated casuals with the customization fiasco lol
[6:10:53] robertjordan83: @Towelliee they dont want to deal with the item restore requests: thats the real reason
[6:10:53] HawtPepperTuna: Blizz always trying to build that endless grind somewhere
[6:10:56] lonelybloody2: what server his on ?
[6:11:02] jeneraljelly: TBC will save SL subs similar to classic with BFA?
[6:11:08] PhoenixAuTv: wait fukin what, so i might aswell do nothing on my alts till patch comes out than farm the gear. Thats so bad @towelliee i agree with u man
[6:11:09] Lincoln_WoW: shadowlands is still better than draenor tho
[6:11:12] racketpunch: they're so hung up on trying to hold gear back as much as possible
[6:11:15] SilkeySmooth: classi tbc will utterly destroy shadowlands
[6:11:18] nilachip: TBC fever
[6:11:44] Knocx: or my new main
[6:11:58] hoodvoker: so glad i got 226 weapons from vault lol
[6:12:16] Dark_lite7: why does it feel like they base all their decisions on a very small percentage of the player base that might abuse a certain system or mechanic, really punishes 99% of the playerbase
[6:12:23] PhoenixAuTv: I think  im more sad than mad. Its like why bother playing, i really really hope they change this, surely
[6:12:28] Hestert: only been pvping since the valor announcement weeks back
[6:12:57] venomizedcarnage: did ginvites go out?
[6:14:07] Macroversal_: what'd they change?
[6:14:14] Frank4LuLz: yup, i did
[6:14:30] Mecabeast: have you gotten the ring from purple marudon?
[6:14:34] chrslp: Swifty but he only does pvp LUL
[6:14:38] jeneraljelly: WOD was the first xpac that burned me out ina  month
[6:14:56] Spaede: i basically raid log now on my main
[6:14:56] Suzaku1011: negative ghostrider,, need shield for holy shield so no 2hander
[6:14:57] SilkeySmooth: pvp was really good in wos so ofcourse bahjeera was still goung for glad
[6:15:36] ArcaneSyntax: i still think the shadowlands is a better begining than both wod, bfa and even mop did.

[6:15:42] PhoenixAuTv: Wait so its not even a good system for people even with ksm, they atleast need to make it that the drops people get now can be upgraded later. Re grinding the same item doesnt respect us as players at all :(
[6:15:45] lonelybloody2: tbc was the best expac for me so im very happy
[6:15:53] Crunker01: no more camera?
[6:16:06] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i sent lula a lvl 20 sword with fiery weapon on it since im not leveling a warrior over here lol
[6:16:08] Plague_GG: !cam
[6:16:08] DocsMistake: yes
[6:16:08] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[6:16:10] ForklyftTV: yes
[6:16:25] SilkeySmooth: no sohort phases tbc lasted a year and a half i want classic tbc for 2 eyars at least
[6:16:36] KnoNock: I used WC quest staff on my warrior
[6:16:52] Crunker01: get better soon brother!
[6:16:56] racketpunch: KSM requirement is a slap in the face to casuals
[6:17:05] Lincoln_WoW: this is also a setup for season 2 when valor is in day 1
[6:17:15] KingSlayerYotam: nice so casuals who are stuck at 203 will get to 207 nice
[6:17:47] fistofnature: That much gold?!?
[6:17:49] fistofnature: jesus
[6:17:59] Wulfgrym: PVP has a static system of gearing, you have to hope and pray you get the gear you need in m+
[6:18:01] PhoenixAuTv: ahhh okay than

[6:18:46] fistofnature: So price will go down for boosting then?
[6:18:49] subluxt7: Its not like Dungeon lists aren't already full of people trying to sell runs...its to the point of ridiculous

[6:19:26] PokerFaceMoose: slows down at 30 pretty big time
[6:19:27] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee You shouldn't have to worry about a weapon for Lula until her whirlwind axe, i sent her a lvl 20 armor + defense rating 2h with fiery wep on it. :P
[6:19:29] DocsMistake: @Towelliee you planning on doing any scarlet monastery today?
[6:19:30] KnoNock: What spec is this druid going to be in TBC?
[6:19:34] Lincoln_WoW: @o_illusionz no but you need ksm for max item level from valor
[6:19:40] jerexify: @o_illusionz Nope. Jusr need KSM to get max level gear, 220.
[6:19:53] DocsMistake: damn I missed them lol I had exams all morning
[6:20:17] Broomba: @towelliee - which SM did you do?
[6:20:23] jerexify: @o_illusionz If you get KSC, all dungeons at 10 or higher, you can go to 213. Otherwise, max is 207.
[6:20:24] PokerFaceMoose: can you do RFD yet?
[6:20:25] CritcobainTV: he did GY and library i think
[6:20:32] CritcobainTV: and then armory
[6:20:32] PokerFaceMoose: also armory
[6:20:43] Exodeo_: It just feels like SL has gone very anti casual to me
[6:20:43] PokerFaceMoose: crit you too good
[6:20:47] Exodeo_: I may be wrong though
[6:21:00] idenkaz_: lmao
[6:21:12] Mecabeast: I use to boost guildies through cathedral when I played
[6:21:14] CritcobainTV: LUL
[6:21:19] gidgeet: lol

[6:21:40] Frank4LuLz: they doo
[6:21:43] Broomba: dd you pick up the wedding ring quest in Lib?
[6:21:44] chrslp: aww D:
[6:21:46] idenkaz_: considering KSM casual is a bit nuts.
[6:22:15] Jericho_J89: what is the max ilvl right now you can possibly get? I am 224 and keep seeing people say 233 but that seems impossible
[6:22:17] 3dRes: HUUUUUUGE
[6:22:20] Frank4LuLz: just farmed 200 cor of mith, damn a battle
[6:22:54] Mecabeast: I've been stuck at 213 no helmet or trinket drops lol
[6:22:58] CritcobainTV: It's crazy to me sometimes just HOW casual people are. Like, I feel like I casually pushed my KSM up, and I've talked to people that are working on getting past 7s. I've played for a long time but damn the gap is way bigger than i thought
[6:23:09] metavahn231: valor to me is just for me to get my trinket thats it LUL
[6:23:10] idenkaz_: am i the only fkn person who thinks this wil lever further the line between casuals and the rest?
[6:23:11] Reinkaos999: will there be world 1st races in tbc tho
[6:23:15] ForklyftTV: @Towelliee I lead a very casual raiding and M+ guild and there is no way most of our memebers can even do the +10 acheive
[6:23:39] TheNoobHimself: @critcobain same this is my first xpac and I've been ksm for weeks from pugging
[6:23:40] chrslp: wanted posters were so damn easy to miss in classic
[6:23:41] RocketMan23: there are also a ton of casual players who dont even care about doing keys at all
[6:23:47] WarStorys: Scammer number just spam it please 872 800 0305
[6:23:48] brazkat: my guild is fairly casual and they struggling on 10s (im a few dung from KSM)
[6:24:10] metavahn231: i think most casuals still dont even get past the fact you need to premake a group to do M+ and cant just queue for it, i think youre reffering to midcore players

[6:32:57] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee  you got reworked...lol
[6:33:10] metavahn231: NERF BRM again Kappa
[6:33:24] CritcobainTV: I think they need to give an armor buff, increase their total hp by 300%, buff WoG by 300% and increase all damage by 300% Kappa
[6:33:32] Plague_GG: give aura mastery to all paladins?

[6:35:43] metavahn231: why is prot so bad on that fight? prot miti that bad?
[6:36:03] spekktrum19: devo aura should give prot pallies an 10% increased armor buff
[6:36:03] Olivermikael: @veramer they get one shot when he tps
[6:36:08] Lincoln_WoW: it has a ton of movement so you lose 15% DR from consecration
[6:36:13] CritcobainTV: Main tank off tank backuptank who heals everyone KEKW
