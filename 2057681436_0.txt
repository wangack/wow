[0:28:40] demiralos: Nameplates usually have a bigger scaling on the Current Target. Could be that the scaling is not applied to the castbar.
[0:28:54] Volryn: Absolutely early morning
[0:29:29] Haestoh: Dan, I'm gonna need an !lfglondon command setting up in here mrgmOk mrgmOk mrgmOk

[0:30:04] demiralos: Yeah, there is a scaling issue. The nameplate shrank when the pet took aggro. So prolly scaling on threat.
[0:30:07] s7wede: Hey Dan, you see the "news" about Danuser?
[0:30:07] Haestoh: I'll let you off

[0:39:30] physalis4: Has SoD been reduced to grinding the same dungeon over and over already?
[0:39:56] demololtv: i like questing but mob competition in duskwood right now is too insane
[0:40:15] physalis4: Imagine if they put a reduced xp debuff in the game for doing a dungeon more than x amt of times
[0:40:39] physalis4: just to encourage ppl to "go outside and discover"

[0:56:11] RAF_Sean: Sell 250 tickets and then have a sweet line up
[0:56:41] Minobard: nah its gdkp
[0:56:57] ponds812: Makes sense
[0:57:03] RAF_Sean: Yeah we worked at a place that had a ratio they maintained
[0:57:04] physalis4: cuz men buy drinks for women
[0:57:05] SlithTheSivak: thats not a thing anymore?
[0:57:13] ahux_: dont want a sausage fest
[0:57:19] demololtv: thjey dont want a sausage party
[0:57:19] fooxytv: it's still a thing
[0:57:20] demololtv: but 2024 things are different
[0:57:35] ponds812: its about makuing moeny for the club
[0:57:41] JakeSezz: That’s why I would get to the club on time and have my pick from the jump & I’m already inside the club HahaThink
[0:57:42] RAF_Sean: It was more for the fact in our case that a bar full of men with few women was more likely to see fights
[0:57:54] RAF_Sean: Girls will happily drink and dance all night, guys are kind of shit
[0:58:09] demololtv: thats so primal LOL
[0:58:16] Lheela: it's kind of a paradox, the more men are in a club, the less men go to that club
[0:58:24] ponds812: arent you British? no way you bad at drinking
[0:58:32] Lheela: so more men = less men
[0:58:48] ponds812: you a mean or happy drunk?
[0:58:54] SlithTheSivak: good at drinking means you can have a lot without showing it
[0:58:58] demololtv: same LMFAO
[0:59:17] RAF_Sean: I was the same way. I also used to make the absolute worst choices the more drunk I got
[0:59:20] demololtv: no such thing as a casual bev
[0:59:37] ponds812: I have the problem that im a mean drunk and aggresive so I quit drinking
[0:59:42] demololtv: yeah or drive
[0:59:51] Tauren0309: I have not had any alcohol for 14 years... That is my issue
[1:00:05] SlithTheSivak: im just glad mocktail culture has taken off so much, there are so many tasty drinks w 0 alcohol now, but they get the same level of care
[1:00:13] RAF_Sean: I was never mean but I'd get drunk and then want to find drugs or steal wheel covers off jeeps
[1:00:30] RAF_Sean: lol
[1:00:34] RAF_Sean: Yeah basically
[1:00:34] ponds812: I hurt my whole famely with it. doing stupuid shit police etc. and treating the people I lvoe badly. I quit drinking 12 years ago
[1:00:46] Lumimyrsky: I just wanna hug everyone when I'm drunk.. LUL
[1:00:51] RAF_Sean: We had a sweet collection of license plates from all the different ports we'd been to
[1:01:02] ponds812: very much so
[1:01:17] RAF_Sean: Also if your plates ever went missing while the Canadian Navy was in town I'm sorry

[1:12:37] MediumRareOG: Part of the Classic fun is learning the zones. Once you do, you kinda know your options
[1:13:00] Jack_the_Dipper: Turn off the router for 30 sec plus and see if it is solved, if not try to set the router back to manufacturer settings and tr again. These are the most simplest solutions
[1:13:38] ZellieMoogle: Cheer100
[1:14:00] MediumRareOG: Cables often are faulty. It's the first thing I'd check. I always buy cables in pairs because I expect one to be bad

[1:15:25] ruffian0305: Gratz!
[1:15:26] illidari_Neeko: Including drinks

[1:21:56] ZellieMoogle: yeah you can do that with Treat Stream I think, afaik you can choose the menu people can pick, and then can limit it :)
[1:22:08] ZellieMoogle: Yeah Just Eat starbucks costs 2 arms and a leg
[1:22:15] Merlock_Holmes: Wow I have no idea how I wasn't following you already youre amazing
[1:22:42] physalis4: Talk to Cory, he has something set up where viewers can buy him food and have it delivered
[1:22:54] ChrisStoll: without any tip too
[1:22:57] Jack_the_Dipper: D:
[1:22:58] ZellieMoogle: £10.18 for me LUL
[1:23:05] RAF_Sean: That's more expensive than our airbnb
[1:23:15] azzurrin: tipthe driver
[1:23:17] SlithTheSivak: Ninja coffee maker could sit right next to u in ur office...fresh espresso whenever u want
[1:23:28] Lheela: thats more than a complete meal at BK where i live
[1:23:35] amricatt: I was under the impression that EU doesn't have tipping culture like NA.
[1:24:02] ZellieMoogle: If I order on Just Eat I never have cash to give a tip with BibleThump Its all done by card
[1:24:04] Jack_the_Dipper: Neither have I. Why would I?
[1:24:08] azzurrin: it's minimum 20% here
[1:24:11] amricatt: Really?  In NA, it's out of control. Seriously.
[1:24:12] politimi_72: i am tipping ocasionally
[1:24:13] Samiccus: tipping culture in Europe is very different from the US
[1:24:20] ChrisStoll: wow... in the US people do bad things to food when no tip
[1:24:24] ahux_: @azzurrin mental
[1:24:27] azzurrin: yea it's stupid
[1:24:30] amricatt: There's a box next to the cashier for tips for the CASHIER only.
[1:24:31] SlithTheSivak: thats just the us
[1:24:33] Rexy95: lol 20% my arse aint happening LUL
[1:24:36] CerebrillUK: my american bias comes through and feel like i have to tip here in the UK for delivery despite noone ever doing it lol
[1:24:38] ahux_: we have a good min wage in the UK
[1:24:43] Jack_the_Dipper: II also don't tip the plumber or the baker
[1:24:52] JakeSezz: I tip my delivery drivers AT LEAST 25%. Not their fault I’m a lazy fuck and don’t wanna go get my food lmao
[1:24:53] azzurrin: it use to be that 10% was a good tip, now bare min is 20%
[1:25:00] azzurrin: if you want good service
[1:25:00] ahux_: paying someone to do their job, im not an employer
[1:25:01] KaisenSiru: anniesGasp
[1:25:04] JakeSezz: But, you know…American hahaha
[1:25:08] ZellieMoogle: To be fair though I think Just Eat drivers are on at least minimum wage - arent tips a think in the US because waiting staff are paid super low?
[1:25:11] MediumRareOG: UK and the US are different. You should absolutely tip in the US. It's different in the UK
[1:25:11] Merlock_Holmes: I've gone to dinners at high end restaurant and the expected minimum is 30%. Let me tell you, it hurts tipping 300$+ lol

[1:25:29] CerebrillUK: in the us wait staff get paid like 2 bucks an hr
[1:25:44] Lheela: it's not their fault, but it's their job bringing your food to you
[1:25:45] Jack_the_Dipper: service fee???
[1:25:46] BckDFUpAntonio: barely any of it goes to the driver
[1:25:54] azzurrin: The thing is employees who work on tips prefer than having a higher hourly wage
[1:25:56] Jack_the_Dipper: its  getting ridicules
[1:26:06] azzurrin: you make more money
[1:26:39] Lheela: "spend more money to spend less money"
[1:26:54] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:26:54] MediumRareOG: Remember a driver will spend 10 minutes on this. Getting paid 1-2 pounds for a small order isn't wroth it. Thus, a service fee
[1:27:10] SlithTheSivak: that can easily be done w more espresso + flavor shots
[1:27:15] Borocil: coffee tastes like crushed bean water. <3
[1:28:10] azzurrin: I spend close to 30$ a day at starbucks
[1:28:21] azzurrin: but I buy for my sister and bro

[1:28:55] azzurrin: I won my own compoany
[1:28:55] amricatt: Starbucks isn't even that good.
[1:28:55] KaisenSiru: triP2W
[1:29:05] azzurrin: I drink a lot of water
[1:29:09] ahux_: Pret > Starbucks
[1:29:12] politimi_72: starbucks is like a gimmick IMO
[1:29:20] Merlock_Holmes: I bought a Nespresso machine and I make my own coffee at home now.  So much cheaper
[1:29:26] Lheela: @azzurrin own or won? :D
[1:29:27] fooxytv: you need a buy me a coffee donation goal
[1:29:27] azzurrin: Lmao, i'm in commercial construction
[1:29:36] ZellieMoogle: I co own a charity, but being a nonprofit/charity I dont get paid LUL
[1:29:44] thecasualcommenter: i spend roughly £5 to £10 a day on white monsters, its a BAD addiction

[1:30:30] Merlock_Holmes: Merlock_Holmes subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:30:38] ZellieMoogle: In my case Ive done the typical chronic illness thing where I cant work a traditional job, so I need to rely on benefits, and then I do way too much work on the charity instead LUL LUL
[1:30:42] thecasualcommenter: are you enjoying SoD
[1:30:45] Merlock_Holmes: For just the price of one coffee a month you too can support Mr. GM.  Lol
[1:30:47] thecasualcommenter: just dinged level 30
[1:30:47] ChrisStoll: Hey was there some news about Danuser last night? Saw some random tweets about something with himn
[1:30:49] ChrisStoll: him*
[1:31:21] ZellieMoogle: The charity is growing though, one day we hope to all be able to have a full wage <3
[1:31:52] physalis4: so did Metzin take over his job for writing?
[1:32:49] RAF_Sean: Yeah very clean
[1:32:55] Lheela: "i cant believe i did the escort" can have a very different meaning
[1:33:30] NeeK_23: Metzen will do the big overarcing plot, but I guess its handed down to Dansuer and team to actually do the writing. I think his role as lead narative will have changed to based on Metzen overseeing this plot
[1:34:20] NeeK_23: jan last year I think? but Nov was the blizxcon reveal so I guess this is when the role change happened
[1:34:59] Jack_the_Dipper: Im such an a*s. On Twitter there is a Twitter account and tells statistics and it was about the top 10 countries with the most children's rights. Someone commented on it asking, 'Where is Canada?' I replied with a scree shot of a map with an arrow pointing to Canada saying 'here' Kappa
[1:35:19] Waxx90: LUL
[1:35:23] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[1:36:29] MediumRareOG: i briefly read the hunter hero talents. it's all about some black arrow
[1:36:47] dright424: people wanted Dark Ranger to be survival
[1:36:54] JakeSezz: The WoW community got up in their feelings over something?! Whaaaaaa?! jakese1Kesip
[1:37:01] Lheela: for me retail is just too comfortable with all the stuff i accumulated over the years, i wouldn't want to start at 0 again in classic
[1:37:19] NeeK_23: They dont like that they want to be "dark rangers" but since there's multiple hero trees, the other tree might be the meta pick
[1:37:34] ZellieMoogle: oops it though that was a link, apologies LUL

[1:38:16] amricatt: I haven't even looked at hero talents. I'm afraid it's gonna be talent bloat.
[1:38:27] ZellieMoogle: @Waxx90 That would be AMAZING! Like the Moogle boss in FFXIV!
[1:39:58] RAF_Sean: Dan, does Twitter Blue let you schedule posts?
[1:40:04] RAF_Sean: I guess I could have just googled that
[1:40:20] NeeK_23: Mage has no active abilites, it just replaces a filler spell
[1:40:33] RAF_Sean: Oh shit it is there!
[1:40:35] RAF_Sean: Legend
[1:40:36] RAF_Sean: <3
[1:40:51] NeeK_23: frostbolt/fireball replaced by frostfirebolt
[1:41:00] RAF_Sean: What a strange design choice
[1:42:07] NeeK_23: frostfirebolt was removed several expacs ago
[1:42:43] physalis4: you gotta have the time to get all that
[1:42:47] RAF_Sean: Yeah you can't compare that
[1:43:00] RAF_Sean: Having run with you I can confirm you are not bad
[1:43:12] bwoods79: I just remember how happy I was as a mage when they got rid of fire mobs being immune to fireballs etc. I just remember having to respec to frost for alar fight

[1:45:13] Rexy95: fall is the best :D

[1:45:28] emarol_dk: emarol_dk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! yo
[1:45:40] RAF_Sean: You need to get that gradual curve up in difficulty. That's how you learn what hurts and what you can ignore
[1:45:42] NeeK_23: also last boss is OP for hunters mark 100% uptime on buff
[1:45:46] physalis4: healing and dispelling on that boss on high keys on Tyran week is THE WORST
[1:45:54] BBMezzy: They nerfed morchie for M+

[1:46:55] RAF_Sean: lol
[1:47:02] Rexy95: why dosnt it just apply like monk and DH
[1:47:15] NeeK_23: if you ever want to do a 15 for KSM, you'd be fine. Just ask me or Sean anytime
[1:48:20] NeeK_23: the fun is in the progression, learning and improving each time. Diving into a high key from the get go isnt going to feel great
[1:48:58] SlithTheSivak: i can barely understand her in interviews
[1:49:02] physalis4: more posh that Posh Spice?
[1:49:05] NeeK_23: of course M+ isnt content everyone has to enjoy and its ok to not do it if you dont

[1:52:12] physalis4: upper class
[1:52:23] DevoidX: either that or from Peterborough :)
[1:52:25] NeeK_23: snooty
[1:52:34] MediumRareOG: Maida Vale isn't posh like inner West London (Kensington, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Holland Park, Notting HIll, Bayswater)
[1:52:49] deathbybubbles49: toff
[1:53:00] ZellieMoogle: thefor74RIP LUL
[1:53:10] MediumRareOG: Maida Vale is kind of like Hampstead-level posh

[1:54:13] physalis4: just living is expensive LUL
[1:54:21] SlithTheSivak: Posh Spice
[1:54:35] MediumRareOG: She was born in 1992. Her parents probably bought their house in the 80s. It porbably cost next to nothing
[1:54:39] NeeK_23: isnt she an essex girl?
[1:54:40] ZellieMoogle: She was just the posh-est Spice I guess LUL
[1:54:45] RAF_Sean: In my head cannon the UK has 2 classes - The ultra rich who own estates and castles and such and then street gangs
[1:54:58] RAF_Sean: lol
[1:55:02] NeeK_23: basically true
[1:55:06] RAF_Sean: M/lord
[1:55:15] illidari_Neeko: I guess there are going to be ‘posh’ places within an area and not so post (chav) places 😂

[1:58:57] NeeK_23: the best part about London is that we can leave
[1:59:30] MediumRareOG: I liked living in London. The real problem is all the airports are terrible
[1:59:46] Merlock_Holmes: Living outside the city is perfect according to every zombie apocalypse movie I've ever watched.
[1:59:57] MediumRareOG: The UK has the absolute worst airports
[2:00:26] physalis4: Atlanta has the busiest airport in the US. It can get really crazy

[2:17:06] RAF_Sean: Really impressed they set up the codes that way honestly

[2:57:50] illidari_Neeko: My sister has joined me in watching you Dan…I’m Proud 😂
[2:57:58] MediumRareOG: sharing tags was one of the better retail changes
[2:58:03] neverbornlucky: so blizzard wow is now diablo4 No Ptr
[2:58:34] garyoldmann: Is hunter a friendly noob class for classic noobs? Curious how managing pet is
[2:58:46] apollymae: all they have to do is keep consecrate up
[2:58:57] NeeK_23: warlock gonna have zero mana once that mob spawns
[2:59:03] Zuldak: Hunter is kinda stereotyped to be the most noob friendly class
[2:59:05] databob1: Watch the patch be lame
[2:59:11] MediumRareOG: what npc is this for?
[2:59:22] databob1: Yes
[3:00:24] MediumRareOG: No wonder I didn't recognize it. I don't know the Wetlands quests super well
[3:00:48] neverbornlucky: Wild Grow America the only  true SOD server all other servers are posers
[3:01:25] databob1: I wonder if T&E may abandon twitch taliesin hardly ever streams anymore
[3:02:00] databob1: Bearly ten days last month
[3:02:26] databob1: Yeah weekly
[3:02:38] databob1: It's ok
[3:02:41] MediumRareOG: don't stop believing
[3:02:49] illidari_Neeko: @mrgm You should do a podcast! I would pay for that! 👍🏼
[3:02:54] NeeK_23: last month he was in NA for the early part then he had 2 videos and a weekly 2hr+ podcast nd weekly reset.
[3:03:35] databob1: It's got evitel in the podcast so that's a plus
[3:03:41] Zuldak: got em
[3:03:56] NeeK_23: are warlocks questing in tank spec now? I respecced back to dots for questing
[3:03:58] databob1: Nice
[3:04:32] neverbornlucky: Taliesin and Eva have been doing podcast as well as we get Taliesin distracted on useless stuff so he never plays the game
[3:05:27] kaijoe_: Yeah, I go to listen to the chats more than the gameplay, which is fine. Different streams for different things.
[3:05:45] neverbornlucky: I bet if he's not streaming means he just doesn't want that tatttoo
[3:05:53] CrowMomocle: What time did you start playing today?
[3:06:07] databob1: They seem to work better together but I think evitel is ether busy with the kids or is just not into it
[3:06:25] neverbornlucky: he promised his chat if they got enough subs in a certain month he would get a naked boulders gate 3 character
[3:06:30] NeeK_23: wow is either personality and chat or keys/pvp. I find there personality streamers more appealing
[3:07:24] Xesol: yea i didnt do wetlands, just been grinding duskwood
[3:07:28] Xesol: and instances
[3:07:34] MediumRareOG: have you done the duskwood quest lines?

[3:13:56] MediumRareOG: I feel like if you're dungeon grinding in Classic you're doing it wrong
[3:14:21] MachoCham: 40?
[3:14:50] thecasualcommenter: where should i level from 30+
[3:14:56] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:15:10] thecasualcommenter: ye im ally
[3:15:25] MediumRareOG: shimmering flats you can do at 30
[3:15:37] databob1: So I wonder if there still going to time gate professions next xpac
[3:15:56] MachoCham: Deleting them
[3:16:00] MachoCham: In the bin they go
[3:16:17] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:17:06] databob1: They should just make them cosmetics, toys and mounts that's all I use them for
[3:17:53] databob1: I never found professions a good way to gear
[3:18:01] MachoCham: Replaced much gear? How's the DPS curve, still feeling OP?
[3:18:33] databob1: Oh good tali is on I think I'll stay here though
[3:18:55] dright424: the 25 part was like 2 months
[3:19:11] Jelky55: yo hows it goinggggggggg
[3:19:17] Xesol: i think it was almost 4 months
[3:19:24] dright424: it released 11/30
[3:19:24] noonz0812: it released on 30th november
[3:19:35] Jelky55: level 40 wont get there by itself, dont need to sleep
[3:19:45] dright424: 2 months and a week
[3:19:49] MediumRareOG: 2.5 months. i feel like that's fine pacing
[3:20:05] MachoCham: Yes
[3:20:08] Xesol: maybe its because of the 3 day raid reset
[3:20:10] Xesol: it felt like forever
[3:20:24] NeeK_23: I didnt enter BFD til last weekend
[3:20:49] sorama: It's also super fast to hit 25
[3:20:52] CrowMomocle: I was leveling alts for profs as well so had lots to do
[3:21:14] CrowMomocle: just taking time out due to house move
[3:21:47] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[3:22:11] NeeK_23: didnt finish because the rest of the group had been doing it regularly so had no time to explain or help and instead just shit on the 3 of us for not being pro classic raiders. Really put me off going back to classic raids again with pugs
[3:22:15] MachoCham: I mean I didn't find it super fast to 25
[3:23:25] dright424: Classic as a game is more casual friendly, but the players are much less casual friendly than retail in my experience
[3:23:34] MachoCham: never get ganked by a Fen Creeper when you want to be
[3:23:44] NeeK_23: we never even pulled the orc. we asked about how to do it and one guy who'd been an ass all raid just left after someone asked for a 5min bathroom break before we pulled
[3:24:01] slyva1510: Is it worth getting into SoD when it's in phase 2?  Won't be able to play until later this month
[3:24:04] MachoCham: TENSION MUSIC
[3:24:20] MachoCham: Do they show for track beasts?
[3:24:36] sorama: I'm guessing part of the friendliness difference is because retail has mythic+/harder content in general to separate from the more casual players.
[3:24:54] CrowMomocle: You can have fun any time you start playing SoD if you enjoy going at your own pace
[3:25:11] NeeK_23: easy if counterspell KEKW
[3:25:21] RAF_Sean: Depends if you have kick bound or not lol
[3:25:23] FrostBeered: The last boss is hard
[3:25:33] sorama: Someone posted on reddit that every boss they 1 or 2 shot except the last which took 11
[3:25:42] slyva1510: @crowmomocle yea I usually always play by myself at a slower pace
[3:25:57] OrthiadNick: I'm afraid to ask, but how many 40's are there? :P
[3:26:11] neverbornlucky: so much for this Taliesin doesn't stream guess who is on right now
[3:26:29] OrthiadNick: luxthoLurk luxthoS
[3:26:34] MachoCham: Can we not point out other streamers are streaming it's a bit monkaS
[3:26:54] sorama: RIP ashenvale event/easy rep
[3:27:06] neverbornlucky: I only said it cause the other person brought it up earlier otherwise no woudl have said naything
[3:27:14] sorama: Yeah but no one's there to kill them
[3:27:22] OrthiadNick: I understood Aggy makes them for him
[3:27:51] neverbornlucky: sorry if I upset on that
[3:27:57] gorkamorka41782: @mrgm it's hysterical to me people racing for world firsts on a rule set the devs have openly said the encounters aren't designed to be Uber hard. Or not designed at all for the sweats. But the Sweats just can't handle not going for internet bragging rights.
[3:28:55] SlithTheSivak: Molten Core will become a PvP map.
[3:28:56] gorkamorka41782: @mrgm first 2 weeks are single lockout
[3:28:57] MachoCham: Hopefully new raids
[3:28:59] sorama: The roadmap doesn't say new raids
[3:29:04] sorama: But who knows
[3:29:10] OrthiadNick: First was 5 days, then 7 days and then every 3 days
[3:29:11] sorama: Yeah
[3:29:12] FrostBeered: watch them make lbrs and ubrs into one dungeon
[3:29:19] FrostBeered: a mega dungeon
[3:29:21] dright424: theres a second SoD update after 60 that says new endgame
[3:29:25] Xesol: if the raids are released as they were people will blast through them super quickly
[3:29:26] neverbornlucky: nooo it says muffin says we getting Pirate Emotes
[3:29:29] SlithTheSivak: back in Vanilla Blackrock Mountain was my favorite PvP map... raid vs raid was epic
[3:29:37] Darkunh: What's the plan a multiverse?
[3:29:44] OrthiadNick: First Lockout: February 8th to February 13th Second Lockout: February 13th to February 20th Third Lockout: February 20th to February 23rd Fourth Lockout: February 23rd to February 26th
[3:30:12] Zuldak: we already have a multiverse with AU Drenor

[3:37:38] thecasualcommenter: but then did grind dungeons to 30 tbh
[3:38:11] thecasualcommenter: left southshore rn because its absolutely full of horde and alliance doing q's
[3:38:15] neverbornlucky: would play more classic if they gave us transmog without gear like retail
[3:38:30] FrostBeered: do you unlock mail armor for hunters in this phase?
[3:38:58] neverbornlucky: because wow classic had so many cool styles but hated holding on gear
[3:39:41] CrowMomocle: green isn't so bad

[3:42:32] neverbornlucky: one pot of coffee put into a keep hot container to pour in a cup all day
[3:42:51] SlithTheSivak: its just a big pot
[3:42:55] MediumRareOG: ca-RAFF
[3:43:07] CrowMomocle: Different trainer

[3:44:46] roshii90: they should never of burned that tree, that city was beautiful
[3:45:10] Mystic_Bard: If was build perfect from the beggining :D
[3:45:11] MediumRareOG: goblin takeover of ironforge -> horde city

[3:57:59] Lausten: Depends on if you're going there or to Darnassus, the boat may be faster than the birb
[3:59:54] illidari_Neeko: I feel like they should have a cap for the amount of dungeons you can do in a day - Similar to what they did for Hardcore 🤔
[4:00:12] MediumRareOG: SoM nerfed dungeon xp. they should've kept that
[4:01:28] MediumRareOG: SoM boosted quest xp. It created a problem where hunteres were out-levelling their pets

[4:08:47] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatREE
[4:09:18] MachoCham: "algorithm"
[4:09:53] Akela3: I don't interact with Shorts one way or another. I watch YouTube for longer form content.
[4:10:02] Jack_the_Dipper: He went  from 120kk to 1m in like a month

[4:11:16] RAF_Sean: Who is this creator? Sounds like a real giga chad
[4:11:30] Jack_the_Dipper: Yes do that but put in the text and show your Twitch name @MrGM
[4:11:33] fooxytv: he did report the issues in the shorts algorithm and got it fixed and his channel blew up
[4:11:55] Jack_the_Dipper: @fooxytv that was after
[4:12:01] RAF_Sean: I love shorts - That's my go to for bathroom breaks
[4:12:09] neverbornlucky: I don't trust youtube shorts all I get is people trying to do stupid things with their kids  usually toddlers when all I watch is stuff on manga recaps, rocket stuff, and japan
[4:12:17] GooseComics: Something like @MrGM "Here is a quick preview of this patches customizations. <content>. Check out my youtube for more context / full guides."
[4:12:19] fooxytv: have you used the shorts creator in the twitch's dashboard?
[4:12:31] Jack_the_Dipper: He blew up before after that it stopped and he contacted YouTube support and then grew  again
[4:12:37] Jack_the_Dipper: He also multi streams to Youtube so that helps as well
[4:13:02] Lausten: Multistream also is weird for chatters
[4:13:27] neverbornlucky: the short that turned me off of youtube was it put up some mom mad cause the toddler wanted their daddy more then their mom
[4:14:33] GooseComics: yeah he used to work for blizzard a long time ago
[4:14:37] fooxytv: that's when it was fixed
[4:14:45] fooxytv: boom
[4:14:47] MachoCham: He had a lot of press around then as well
[4:14:57] MachoCham: Because he was talking about Wow on stream

[4:20:26] thereal_stmarie: otters tear faces off in Montana, hard pass
[4:20:58] Lausten: Perfect for shorts ;)
[4:21:08] MachoCham: Now I just miss Faffy as he had a quote bot
[4:21:24] neverbornlucky: sorry to say MrGM , panda tried that he went crazy

[4:23:11] fooxytv: burn it!
[4:23:15] MachoCham: Wish Deathwing would fucking land on the houses of parliament
[4:23:29] neverbornlucky: MrGm later  finds out it is so great cause it was AI created
[4:24:23] neverbornlucky: it was ai
[4:24:23] GooseComics: its not real. they are not making a 3rd movie

[4:25:28] MediumRareOG: the voice sounds like scarlett johanssen
[4:25:30] Lausten: Leaked pre touch up trailer Kappa
[4:25:31] GooseComics: WW3: The Staring
[4:25:31] RAF_Sean: Batman looked like he was holding in a fart
[4:25:47] neverbornlucky: maybe AI can make a better Live action movie then DC can
[4:25:57] Akela3: the way their skin crawls is so disturbing
[4:25:57] GooseComics: It didn't really make anything. Its just them staring
[4:26:01] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:26:26] GooseComics: not really no
[4:26:46] GooseComics: I mean I can totally see that its just bad AI. but to each thier own :X
[4:27:05] GooseComics: sorry. didn't mean to bring the mood down
[4:27:20] Akela3: it's impressive that it can do that much for sure
[4:27:20] neverbornlucky: its real
[4:28:03] thereal_stmarie: scary if you're an actor
[4:28:03] Lausten: Yeah thats what scares me, its so new still, the future will be wild..
[4:28:03] Akela3: there's definitely no stopping it
[4:28:12] GooseComics: it can stop by proper legislation to protect actual artists
[4:28:28] MediumRareOG: Use AI to bring back Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man
[4:28:47] RAF_Sean: The platform I record the show in has AI generated show notes, trasncript, summary and it can identify good clips and then spit them out as well
[4:28:49] GooseComics: @MediumRareOG and get sued in the process
[4:28:51] Akela3: copyright and privacy are two areas it needs regulated
[4:28:58] RAF_Sean: AI has made my workflow so much faster
[4:29:03] GooseComics: That was porn though not just a random trailer
[4:29:10] RAF_Sean: Yeah they did AI generated images of her nude
[4:29:11] Lausten: There was some weird porn
[4:29:18] GooseComics: it was tswift
[4:29:19] thereal_stmarie: until the AI gets good enough and they don't need actual actors
[4:29:38] RAF_Sean: >.>
[4:29:43] Akela3: gross
[4:29:47] Jack_the_Dipper: Damn Mantieus
[4:29:49] Zuldak: i dont get how AI made deep fakes is any different than photoshopping
[4:29:51] RAF_Sean: Where would you even find that
[4:29:53] RAF_Sean: <.<
[4:29:56] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL

[4:30:39] RAF_Sean: @Zuldak It's not that it is, the issue is the consent of the subject
[4:30:45] Lausten: I read a post on /r/Denmark yesterday about a guy that was weirded out by a co worker that used AI to make a female coworker naked, thats so creppy..
[4:30:48] Akela3: its essentially the same but one requires so actual skill to make
[4:30:53] volkreig: volkreig subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hope you and the family are all good, hows P2 going?
[4:30:54] Akela3: no*
[4:30:56] Zuldak: @RAF_Sean yeah i get it but this has been an issue for a while. it isnt new is my point.
[4:30:59] kasherek_: today is my birthday
[4:31:18] RAF_Sean: @Zuldak Oh I gotcha! yeah been a problem for a long time
[4:31:43] Jack_the_Dipper: @kasherek_ Happy birthday yarrBongos
[4:31:47] Zuldak: yeah i am not saying it isnt a problem, just that this issue has been here since the 2000s.
[4:31:50] Jack_the_Dipper: bit sick
[4:32:24] Akela3: yes please
[4:32:27] RAF_Sean: Humanity was a failed experiment
[4:32:28] Zuldak: Mission to mars time
[4:32:34] GooseComics: delete the internet
[4:32:53] Lausten: Yeah taht was also the guys most weirded out moment, and he was wondering if it actually counted as a crime due to image sharing.. They were discussing the law about that kind of images actually being considered the same as real pictures in regards to the law..
[4:32:57] GooseComics: Or just make the internet work like it did in the 90s where it was a hassle to get online.
[4:32:59] thereal_stmarie: whoever built the pyramids please come back a push the reset button
[4:33:42] GooseComics: MOM GET OFF THE PHONE IM USING THE  INTERNET
[4:34:08] Lausten: They were discussing if he did it but kept it to himself, wether or not it would be legal, its a crazy time to be alive.. O_o
[4:34:14] GooseComics: ok get rid of the internet on mobile devices.
[4:34:17] MrEvilRex: you can still get lnadlines
[4:34:19] Jack_the_Dipper: @GooseComics LUL
[4:34:21] GooseComics: let phones be phones again
[4:34:25] MrEvilRex: landlines*
[4:34:38] MrEvilRex: so what do you mean by bring back?
[4:34:47] Akela3: there's a whole thing where the phone companies here in the US are trying to turn off their old landline phone networks and people are suing them to stop it
[4:35:06] Jack_the_Dipper: I removed my land phone
[4:35:32] FinkTV: FinkTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! cheers!
[4:35:35] GooseComics: Bring back actual phone numbers that people remember. Most young people have no idea what their families numbers are its just.. mom, dad, sister, or brother instead of an actual number
[4:35:36] Akela3: lol
[4:35:37] Jack_the_Dipper: hahaha
[4:35:53] FinkTV: yes sir!
[4:36:03] FinkTV: no problem at all!
[4:36:03] chompster2111: Wagwan boys hows sod?
[4:36:21] MrEvilRex: @MrGM you can tell the company I do not want a landline as part of my package and usually they will try to say "it's required, etc" but if you r persistent you might be able to get it remove from your bill
[4:36:27] GooseComics: but most young people do not though
[4:37:07] Jack_the_Dipper: Back in the days people used address book to write them down
[4:37:15] GooseComics: 123-123-1234
[4:37:17] DevoidX: landline networks is being turned off next year
[4:37:18] CanadianHeavy: 10
[4:37:23] MediumRareOG: 10 digits
[4:37:23] thereal_stmarie: 10 numbers
[4:37:31] chompster2111: @GooseComics zoomer here why would i have a landline if i u want to ring me just use whatsapp lmfao
[4:37:36] Lausten: Danish ones are only 8 LUL
[4:37:37] GooseComics: (123)123-123

[4:38:01] MrEvilRex: if it's the type of company where they say "You have to rent the phone line in order to deliver the internet" then yh, you might be able to argue with em to get it removed.
[4:38:05] Jack_the_Dipper: Dutch 8 as well unless you use the country code
[4:38:10] Lausten: I think we scrapped area codes, we used to have them
[4:38:14] RAF_Sean: The country code makes NA numbers 11
[4:38:45] GooseComics: Yeah its just 10. We don't use the country code to dial in country. If we call within our area code, its just 7 numbers. 123-1234
[4:38:52] RAF_Sean: Canada and the USA are both +1 (555) 555-5555
[4:39:00] MrEvilRex: @MrGM w8 so you chose to have a landline? I thought you were forced to
[4:39:10] Lausten: We are +45
[4:39:11] RAF_Sean: 4 times as good innit
[4:39:19] Jack_the_Dipper: I think phone numbers will be gone in 30 year. We going to use like usernames or email
[4:39:25] GooseComics: USA, CA, and Mexica use the same type of numbers
[4:39:33] CrowMomocle: no we had to get a landline as well with BT
[4:39:42] RAF_Sean: Just gonna neurolink to each other
[4:39:42] CrowMomocle: we never even had a phone to use on it
[4:39:45] MrEvilRex: I mean being billed for one, not whether your house had the bale or not
[4:40:10] GooseComics: sorry i meant the same (123)123-1234. Mexico, US, and CA have different country codfes
[4:40:57] Lausten: Show us and dox yourself
[4:41:22] MrEvilRex: no? no? smart answer

[4:48:29] neverbornlucky: MrGm , asmongold watched something on it

[4:49:08] NeeK_23: 16 was out last year
[4:49:17] NeeK_23: each game is stand alone
[4:49:18] Lausten: Never understood the mmo aspect of adding numbers like that
[4:49:22] MediumRareOG: well, 54 more attempts, no mount. i'll definitely get it tomorrow
[4:49:30] Lausten: Oh is there only 1 mmo one?
[4:49:39] phyra: i've read that the sleeping bag quest gives 1 time foods that grant a lot of rested xp. However, I want to see a screenshot or something not just comments
[4:49:47] MediumRareOG: yeah, 54 a day, takes ~2 hours
[4:49:50] GooseComics: 2 @Lausten FF11 and FF14

[4:49:56] survhunterdream: 11 and 14 are mmos
[4:49:56] phyra: FF11 and FF14 are mmos
[4:50:09] Lausten: Damn, so confusing

[4:50:20] wastedxtime93: Jeez, and I hated doing just my daily 13 runs lmao
[4:50:26] phyra: Played ff11 before wow came out, was one of those mmos where you can't really solo and you can de-level
[4:50:34] wastedxtime93: Still no Love Rocket or manuscrpit
[4:50:58] wastedxtime93: It's okay, we'll get 'em before it ends. (L
[4:51:01] wastedxtime93: (: *
[4:51:14] GooseComics: yeah id rather just not grind on alts for that mount.
[4:51:28] GooseComics: id rather do literally anything else besides that
[4:51:36] demiralos: 1 of 100
[4:51:43] demiralos: after that its 1 of 3333
[4:51:46] wastedxtime93: Shit with a 0.25 multiplier I'm guessing lmao
[4:51:48] GooseComics: who fucking knows. no one has any specific information on the drop chance
[4:52:17] wastedxtime93: Gonna do my first of the day while here on lunch break, wish me luck friends.
[4:52:29] GooseComics: its just "drastically increased"
[4:52:44] GooseComics: @wastedxtime93 ez 1st try #IWASHERE #THISISIT
[4:52:46] Dantares24: its 50% drop. you either get it or you don't
[4:53:38] wastedxtime93: Sent in a ticket too just last night about the Pirates Day dragonriding armor still being locked and it's still a known issue without a fix atm -_-
[4:54:12] wastedxtime93: The 50k one you had to buy, I learned it and it's been locked ever since, never got my gold back in the mail.
[4:54:46] wastedxtime93: And then they hit us with the gold sink achievement, my broke ass is hurting haha
[4:55:31] NeeK_23: I have it LuL
[4:55:52] NeeK_23: its like a week of WQ for me
[4:55:52] wastedxtime93: I'm about to get it right now, but first run done and nada
[4:56:13] wastedxtime93: All good, got enough to buy the new mount at least.
[4:56:37] zantos2020: 50k is like $4 worth of wow token
[4:58:58] RAF_Sean: it's weird, I really enjoyed WQs in BFA but since SL I've fallen off completely
[4:59:02] GooseComics: i hecking forgot about that rep. what do you even get lol?
[4:59:09] NeeK_23: I only do racing and the raw gold ones, usually 10k per week, I do it passively on as many alts as I can be bothered with
[4:59:16] GooseComics: makes sense why i forgot about them
[4:59:30] GooseComics: yeah 10k easy
[4:59:41] wastedxtime93: I finally just went and completed the meta achievement for the FB the other day, those pesky scrolls were kinda annoying lo

[5:18:35] RAF_Sean: Love Cayna, great guy
[5:19:43] RAF_Sean: Behind the scenes stuff like this would make great YouTube shorts
[5:19:50] phyra: True, I know your videos should be accurate to release. And then on the other hand some people make videos that go out ASAP and are inaccurate but will also have whatever degen thing raiders are doing before it gets nerfed.
[5:20:01] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[5:21:08] phyra: stuff thats rushed out is not useful a few hours-days later

[5:23:13] RAF_Sean: Dude I love Soul - He's one of the very few creators I have notifications turned on for
[5:23:14] phyra: its a bit luck of the draw, maybe you aren't questing near where hunter runes are
[5:23:28] RAF_Sean: and he was in QA before so he comes at things with such a great eye for detail
[5:23:32] Layliah79: prob yes
[5:24:12] Ydrann: Yeah, I was actually in his stream when he made that.
