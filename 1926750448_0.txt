[1:03:51] DargieK: rocking the 3080TI still
[1:04:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: One thing to consider is that 4090 can often be CPU bound, so it can use a better one...for Starfield it could help a bit
[1:04:24] Bugszy: a cool partnership
[1:04:29] Sarcastard: 10G allowance

[1:26:27] JerBoody: @zodiac0527 You can literally do anything you want except rez if you die
[1:26:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: So yeah if it works like that evoker one, it can't be traded
[1:26:49] Brlskull: prob going to be like the evoker one
[1:26:56] Brlskull: where you just have to do higest diff hopefully

[1:27:24] Zodiac0527: @JerBoody so you can trade items and such
[1:27:30] kyshen3: yea i was thinking you were REALLY gonna play LA but didn't know if it was gonna be like a destiny sorta deal.
[1:28:07] JerBoody: Yup, also dungeons have a 24 hour lockout until you’re 60
[1:28:31] JerBoody: But other than that it’s classic without being able to rez

[2:46:03] PvtHudson093: Crusader or riot
[2:46:08] wolfieke: well I can only speak for me and mates at work but d4 was a big dissapointment because of the whole new paragon system , diablo with a max lvl feels weird ... diablo is not supposed to have a max level lol
[2:46:15] Totemkatsu: unless they add a new class i dont see it lifting off much more than it did at first launch. seaon 1 brought almost nothing
[2:46:15] Nokterian: this first season of D4 it didnt get me at all also the xp boost lasting a weekend is just not enough
[2:46:42] abracka_: imo they fumbled that first season
[2:46:49] mcatx2: Some creators talked about how they are kind of iffy about the D4 Xpacs.  Something if Blizzard uses the xpac to make the original release better.
