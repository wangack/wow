[3:15:19] AxiomDK: I can send u the macro for pet sac
[3:15:21] AxiomDK: 1 sec
[3:15:36] AethrosTempest: Enfeeble is up a lot
[3:15:44] al_capow: GetTime() is the api for current time that could be read like mes mentioned on spell succeed
[3:15:50] AxiomDK: think its bad to use as unholy personally
[3:15:55] al_capow: and you can save it to `aura_env` to persist it
[3:15:57] vitelvix: real question is why the fuck did they keep control undead on the talent tree
[3:17:00] al_capow: you can
[3:17:11] dawsonator171: I can't do shit with WA
[3:17:17] dawsonator171: im horrible at using it.
[3:17:32] al_capow: I'm trying to do it but you have to be really careful since the client has a lot of rules for when you can/can't touch secure frames
[3:18:06] dawsonator171: I just want data points for this level of mastery I have in pvp and the reset timer.
[3:18:15] al_capow: daws ill make ti quick
[3:18:25] dawsonator171: cuz I have a secondary build I play outside of 1 shot that utilizes all this mastery.

[3:50:54] sicmatesick09: what is this Que bra
[3:51:41] gachie_: how hard is it to hit 1800 in rss atm?
[3:53:21] waitimdesyncd: ya sack of potaters
[3:54:28] gachie_: wait so when do you go the coil build, or is the disease build generally better overall
[3:55:02] sunileif: why is that being held?
[3:55:28] waitimdesyncd: @gachie_  Well death coil and wounds is the big dam in both builds. And you an easily get 2400 with both clawing and aoe pressure build. It depends on your playstyle and teammates
[3:56:33] gachie_: ah right, i see
[3:56:41] gachie_: ngl the clawing build is kinda fun
[3:56:45] dawsonator171: is mag gonna try to compete this year?
[3:57:09] dawsonator171: Cuz I would like to see both marvin and mag compete.
[3:57:45] waitimdesyncd: @gachie_  Yeah clawing is also easier to mange seeing you look for doom burst to get big clawing and wound pops in a few globals to overwhelm them. Aoe pressure can be good at 3s premade for example. And solo shuff you might play short games using clawing to kite giga-melees
[3:58:35] waitimdesyncd: @gachie_  you cant really go wrong right now. There are also up to 2-3 talents in both spec and class trees that you can freely move  around and find what suits you
[3:58:50] dawsonator171: pretty sure they broke earthen.
[3:59:05] dawsonator171: +

[4:01:54] dawsonator171: I have all of my movement keys rebound and only double click to move

[4:35:41] Meadamemnon: @notmes sorry if you answered this earlier, but im having trouble with what my ideal stats should be as UH?
[4:36:01] dawsonator171: just get it to drop mes. EZ
[4:36:26] avenueone: just make 15 dk alts
[4:37:41] Meadamemnon: so definitely need 30% vers or is 23% okay?
[4:37:50] dawsonator171: mes, if you had any advice to achieve greatness, what would it be?
[4:37:55] Meadamemnon: err 28% i mean
[4:38:46] Meadamemnon: i feel way stronger stacking more mastery then when stacking to 30% vers

[4:50:09] dawsonator171: warriors can play in a lot more comps, generally speaking, so it seems like the best investment.
[4:50:09] shugguls: war will get a buff, its bottom in pve so prob 3%
[4:50:44] ImHomegr0wn: oh yeah I see the right shift is smaller
[4:51:08] doomcute: got 293k mortal crit on warlock with my legendary

[5:50:01] injos: If I wanted to start pvp. What's the best way to get gear. Just farm soloque (insta que) or wait for BG que pop?
[5:51:27] xoHOLLOW: @injos if you havent got honor gear yet, i like finding a healer and doing bg blitz. it scales your ilvl up and is pretty fast win or loss with good honor gains. and really fun.
[5:51:28] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:51:41] xoHOLLOW: or if you're a healer its even easier
[5:52:07] injos: I'm playing disc, got 483 ilvl from m+. But no pvp gear
[5:53:14] xoHOLLOW: @injos i would just que bg blitz by ur self or find a dps buddy and duo que with them. solo shuffle isnt too fun if you dont have vers gear which pve gear tends not to have
[5:54:14] injos: ok. Can try. Had a 9min que last time for blitz.
[5:54:31] injos: I have 24% vers. But it feels a bit low.

[5:55:31] dawsonator171: but i can reset prim wave in as short as 15 seconds with an average of 25.
[5:55:33] xoHOLLOW: then solo shuffle should feel fine
[5:55:52] dawsonator171: I proc over 100% mastery with this setup.
[5:56:04] dawsonator171: so with proper maelstrom pooling I can dump a lot right after.

[6:05:03] happyheals: however my rogue named wetfart didn't last 2 weeks
[6:05:21] BaldDaddyx: @happyheals I think it’s just because I’ve been forced to change that same guild name in retail before so they weren’t dealing with it again
[6:06:19] happyheals: Ogre Warbead Cartel would be a solid guild name
