[1:30:15] mastropiero9: Football because u play it with your feet
[1:30:28] g0nza_a: i mean, in argentina futbol its the way to say soccer
[1:30:33] cellardoore: Handegg

[1:30:50] atomsej: handegg
[1:30:52] MythicSam: trolling
[1:30:56] ChubbyMikey: Football is not a specific sport, it's a category encompassing association football, rugby football and american football. Association became "soccer", Rugby is simply rugby, but you can't call American football simply "American" can you? so you just shorten it to football.
[1:30:56] iam_back_beachesd: its more like rugby
[1:30:56] simplithing: True
[1:30:57] krispurrstv: the sub shouldnt be 20cad.. blah
[1:31:00] xxdockingdavexx: You're a Marvel fan
[1:31:01] CreadyDaGoat: a football isnt even a ball its some other shape

[1:31:14] dap31_: did Shahzam ever ask for a “team shower”?
[1:31:20] iam_back_beachesd: @ChubbyMikey then call it rugby
[1:31:24] d0ntPhaZe: still worth playing for someone who never tried?
[1:31:26] oDisMal: HUH
[1:31:27] onewhotv: what’s his nick in the game?
[1:31:27] mastropiero9: Thats so braindead
[1:31:33] CreadyDaGoat: so that sounds like we just need a new name for it then
[1:31:36] kokal9: those are whole lot of words to say nothing
[1:31:36] CelektivV: @d0ntPhaZe its always worth
[1:31:42] atomsej: american rugby
[1:31:43] slumberlusts: that's some copium logic
[1:31:44] ChubbyMikey: except Rubgy is rubgy
[1:31:46] 5pecial_6uest: it's already f2p with gold, that's how the bots keep playing
[1:31:49] atomsej: @ChubbyMikey american rugby

[1:31:54] DCXVInobody: American Rugby
[1:32:01] g0nza_a: ye for me its futbol, american rugby and rugby
[1:32:04] iam_back_beachesd: handball

[1:32:37] pooge32: woah when did you switch off 400dpi shroud
[1:32:42] xTrueEast: complaining about americancs again peepoPooPoo
[1:32:49] Sevaar87: dudes getting hard carried. jfc
[1:32:58] g0nza_a: @mastropiero9 closer then americal football because includes hand play
[1:32:58] ChubbyMikey: Or maybe the rest of the world could just stop being idiots and thinking that the people that stopped calling soccer in the 60s due to Anti-American sentiment had a monopoly on it. They were wrong then, and still wrong today
[1:33:02] itsyoboivad: @shroud american football shouldn't be called a 'football'. The game is played mostly with hands. While soccer is the real 'football'. IMHO
[1:33:19] ChubbyMikey: and futbol is just a cognate of teh English football
[1:33:23] lushhprod: why does this not look liek wow
[1:33:27] lushhprod: is this classic?
[1:33:30] hungrybong01: It's just Americans wanting to differentiate themselves from British - how do you do that, change the language - color for colour, flavor for flavour, soccer for football
[1:33:31] harley_thf: @itsyoboivad true

[5:12:18] Itsacinch: gamble stream

[5:35:22] bartfux: @yeetcaonima you're so fuckin edgy and cool.
[5:35:26] papieggroll: altogether its 49g
[5:35:28] Kalibak_m: !server

[5:37:01] EmPeTre123: Kill the panther. It drops a quest item
[5:37:05] roippa: Looking to level blacksmithing and its expensive
[5:37:05] kennyyy_ow: That tiger is a quest
[5:37:08] SlackedSoju: I personally would try to get gold otherwise, you'll want quests when the next level band opens.
[5:37:08] romdall1: @roippa offer tanking serices or quest
[5:37:12] kennyyy_ow: drops quest
[5:37:13] JonLurK: shroud man dude bro
[5:37:15] Thangos1120: @JayBookers you'd just do dungeons? quests arent the only way to get XP
[5:37:17] zorkablack: Quests, when you are cap give extra gold
[5:37:20] JayBookers: @romdall1 so I'll be forced to dungeon grind until I can a few levels and can quest in new area?
[5:37:26] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[5:37:44] roippa: @romdall1 i hate tanking, leveled 2 60s in hc and got bored of it now i want to just dps
[5:37:47] reagadin: @shroud dont do all the quests. what will you do when further levels open
[5:37:50] SpaceVoyage: is that a different addon called minimapstats?
[5:37:53] romdall1: @JayBookers dungeon grinding is way more efficient 25-40 than questing

[5:42:03] Krazed59: @cl0za The rune is 5g, but you have to do a 3-part quest first that requires mats you can buy if you don't want to waste hours farming mats

[6:07:48] Cheezburglar804: need to install some insulation
[6:07:48] payyn518: someone added it after it was built?
[6:07:48] constantinetwitch91: @shroud not as good insulation
[6:07:50] Spikeqc: Kapp
[6:07:52] Aj_Bamf: hvac
[6:07:59] Fossabot: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[6:08:01] zorkablack: You have to get better isolation in the room
[6:08:02] m_dep: No insulation?
[6:08:03] subtoxiic: anything in SoCal under 65 is freezing
[6:08:05] JerseyBricklayer: shroudLurk
[6:08:09] m_dep: You generally need to install insulation
[6:08:15] felkano: just like pokimane
[6:08:23] drakethewhelp: ratchet guards only on outskirts
[6:08:24] AlphaSimply: yep same for every class too, a rune for each
[6:08:25] PortmanPro: ur pog today
[6:08:25] dpetkov354: The insulation is probably not the same thickness or quality like the one if main part of the house.
[6:08:26] subtoxiic: SoCal ice freezzes at 62F
[6:08:27] Cheezburglar804: your secret rune
[6:08:34] AlphaSimply: so much G, fish oil is not easy to get lol

[6:08:56] alpacabowldood: if theyyre not double paned
[6:08:57] Repsie: 3 glass windows
[6:08:58] Aj_Bamf: big room like that is hard to maintain temp
[6:08:58] Dopey: nothing you can do
[6:09:01] sheep_duck: Windows can be insulated
[6:09:01] SirPsychoLucky: You prefer cold or hot temperatures for a long wow session?
[6:09:02] Lu_EG_: AHH
[6:09:02] Delifes: cheap windows then
[6:09:05] alpacabowldood: gotta get double pane windows

[6:09:12] AlphaSimply: KEKW

[6:09:13] ADLYDz: @alpacabowldood triple
[6:09:15] Aj_Bamf: soda?
[6:09:15] felkano: KEKW
[6:09:16] ImYuishi: you can put insulation on windows
[6:09:16] gyno_lord: just say so
[6:09:16] davethedemon25: how do you have 30g
[6:09:17] mcnasty1921: they make insulated windows

[6:09:33] Stickypanini: I just got warbringer rune :D was hella expensive on time and gold
[6:09:33] Arnagel: when an ad pops up and your ears get blown out
[6:09:35] TheMixedNuts: Air is insulation
[6:09:39] JakeStratic: Yea he told me something about wanting to talkign to someone of a higher status. I just didn't realize he meant cash lmao
[6:09:40] razorblahd: does it say <Tier 3 Pokimane Sub> under his name?
[6:09:41] subtoxiic: what, are those 28 $ windows?
[6:09:41] TallGuy_Joshy: Cookie Vendor KEKW
[6:09:43] SHAD0WPAGE: P OMEGALUL KIMANE
[6:09:46] JJacooz: KEKW
[6:09:46] Hamer_TheLegend3: Is he selling cookies?
[6:09:47] zorkablack: That's for sure, but the window has insulation most of the time
[6:09:50] Dopey: yea but then you have no windows?
[6:09:52] dapyman: Double pane
[6:09:52] felere: double glaze
[6:09:54] alpacabowldood: two layers of glass
[6:09:54] ThatSneakyRussian: double pane
[6:09:55] roflSloth: 2 panes
[6:09:55] drakethewhelp: double pane glass
[6:09:57] x_tybalt_x: double glazed
[6:09:57] itsrambo: double pane
[6:09:58] romdall1: double pane
[6:09:58] TheMixedNuts: air gap in windows...air is insulation
[6:10:01] sheep_duck: Double pane with a certain gas in-between them
[6:10:02] JustJess: double layer them, air inbetween
[6:10:03] faded1896: A good seal around the windows is important too
[6:10:03] Repsie: with multiple sheets of glass, the air inbetween are insulation @shroud
[6:10:07] Measai: yea, 3 pane stacked windozs
[6:10:08] x_tybalt_x: they are just a liner
[6:10:09] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[6:10:10] HeIlraiser_: glaze
[6:10:19] dpetkov354: The type of chamber in the window pane. It can be double triple etc.
[6:10:20] zoulist: anyone else is sitting in front of all the wow streams and constantly thinks to himself "fuck nah... i am not starting WOW again...do i ?"
[6:10:22] mcnasty1921: multiple layers and thicker panes
[6:10:22] TalonRL: MOST PEOPLE THINK THERES ARGON GAS BUT USUALLY THERE ISNT ITS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE
[6:10:26] TalonRL: oops caps
[6:10:27] ThatSneakyRussian: it can be
[6:10:27] mccarries: take trash bags and cover them up lol
[6:10:29] JakeStratic: You can get 'insulated' windows & then install automatic curtains that come down... but then the windows would have to be covered.
[6:10:30] Dopey: actually might be more effective
[6:10:31] saifo9: Air gap between glass panels is technically insulation
[6:10:33] jayonyx_: lol so pretty much create a airlock
[6:10:36] roflSloth: it's pretty close tbh
[6:10:37] JakeStratic: Nah, can't beat a normal insulated wall
[6:10:38] Perish_TV: depends on how thick the glass as well
[6:10:39] hatad: Better
[6:10:39] Doxtater115: Depends how expensive ur windows are
[6:10:40] NO_M3RCY_R2: shroud thanks for streaming this late! it was a rough day today so watching the stream has been awesome
[6:10:44] kemba775: its better
[6:10:45] Elceecruz04: ive only ever played retail. what are runes?
[6:10:46] insaniity: wallhacks will always be better :) @shroud
[6:10:47] Steadmoh190: double glazed windows is mainly used for sound protection like if you live in a busy road
[6:10:48] razorblahd: just get some AC on the outside of the windows
[6:10:49] faded1896: Its pretty good, but I would say thick wall insulation holds heat better
[6:10:51] ImYuishi: @NO_M3RCY_R2 I hope tomorrow is better!
[6:10:52] aasmundp: its not even close
[6:10:53] sheep_duck: There's a certain kind of gas in the good windows that works well as insulation @shroud
[6:10:53] DirtySusan: What about WoW has made it so good for so long for you?
[6:10:58] jbizzygamingg: My dads a window. It’s the same as walls
[6:10:58] HeIlraiser_: reflection
[6:11:04] ThatSneakyRussian: @shroud a lot of older walls are terribly insulated. Even modern builds are being cheaped out and are also terribly insulated now
[6:11:06] roflSloth: air takes a lot of energy to heat up or cool down
[6:11:09] JakeStratic: When the sun is out though, the windows can be better for warmth. but at dark, they'll never be as good as an equal wall
[6:11:12] Hezzer: think of a glasshouse for plants
[6:11:12] NO_M3RCY_R2: @imyuishi Ty!!
[6:11:12] JustJess: it's usually better, walls aren't airtight and they transfer heat as a conductor, an air gap doesn't absorb heat well
[6:11:16] pakamov: wall insulation principle is the same , its the air that is the insulation
[6:11:19] saifo9: It depends also on the mullions and the silicone they are using, it is sense im an architect 😂😂
[6:11:19] Dopey: ur an mmo guy
[6:11:19] Barrettj: the grind
[6:11:30] subtoxiic: how come Cookies are baked and not cooked..
[6:11:31] MXRYDER17: yes they use a wrap to insultae windows in cloder climates to keep the house warm due to the below freezin temps non stop
[6:11:35] Hamer_TheLegend3: @zoulist again? I've never played a single time and even for me it looks interesting
[6:11:36] Elceecruz04: Sunk cost falacy?
[6:11:37] Steadmoh190: LUL
[6:11:39] DrVenice: physics shroud physics
[6:11:39] smcoffey: shroud lives in california his windows are probably energy efficient and required to be in that state.  california has billions of laws more than other states
[6:11:42] subtoxiic: should be called bakeies
[6:11:42] JeezDeath420: lol
[6:11:53] SiRenQT: Community
[6:11:53] bootycheeker: what’s the raid lockout
[6:11:54] TallGuy_Joshy: of all the MMOs ive played over the years, none are like WoW IMO

[6:12:22] jimipuffit: comfort food
[6:12:23] romdall1: Nothing comes close to it gameplay wise
[6:12:26] Blythe90: gameplay is better than any MMO by miles
[6:12:27] Homewrecka: newer games arent as fun as wow
[6:12:33] donhuanxinfinite: this game is good becaus the things you do in it matter
[6:12:33] MrSnoodlezz: I’d like to play WoW but it seems like a lot to understand
[6:12:34] Iol69: its a fun game
[6:12:34] xxbigtrev: nothing hits like wow
[6:12:34] constantinetwitch91: @shroud even with dated grafics it still one of the most beautiful worlds
[6:12:40] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: rift was good yeah
[6:12:40] RedwingXD: i play all the mmos and yet always come back to wow

[6:12:48] Hoaxeh: Rift was AWESOME
[6:12:49] JakeStratic: The only MMO that ever competed with WOW for me was Warhammer Online & it died because of poor management.
[6:12:49] Largefingerr: New World is good tho
[6:12:50] pontocore: @pakamov what are you saying here? its the air that are the insulation? 😆
[6:12:50] JoaEUW: My 3 mates and i talk about Rift almost on the weekly / monthly. We miss it SO much
[6:12:51] coco23x: OSRS the goat
[6:12:52] kokal9: i loved rift too !
[6:12:56] Humicrobe: jumped into a chimney on top of a house now stuck had to wait 45min for hearth
[6:12:58] iamgifu: rift was cool
[6:12:58] Alias2552: Wildstar bro, release it in the current climate and it would be going crazy
[6:12:59] EASEPEASE: rift is what they need to do to retail wow in regards to all classes can be every spec but have their own niche
[6:13:01] kokal9: i used to play some fire mage idk what it was called
[6:13:01] gnomleif: Rift was fantastic
[6:13:05] romdall1: Wildstar FeelsBadMan
[6:13:09] xolossus00: elders scroll kinda managed to do it
[6:13:13] Iol69: osrs is great @coco23x
[6:13:14] Squallhero: do you like ffxiv then?
[6:13:18] ImYuishi: did you try First Descendant?

[6:13:29] mikewantshelp: @shroud How bout RIOTS new MMO?
[6:13:30] pakamov: @pontocore yup basically insulation is trying to trap as much air as possible to use as insulation
[6:13:32] Largefingerr: New World is different and good
[6:13:33] itsrambo: they pay to winned too hard
[6:13:34] potf: go play return of reckoning(resurrected private warhammer mmo) thats quite a wow clone
[6:13:34] sheep_duck: It's got a good balance is old school mechanics and new age qol changes
[6:13:37] RedwingXD: Aion was cool also when it came out
[6:13:41] Lokeptt: i was there for the rift BETA it was so good
[6:13:46] itsrambo: Archeage 2 seems interesting
[6:13:47] zorkablack: The game is like you can never finish everything as an end game,  there is always something new

[6:13:54] tr_Vex: Iron man mode on OSRS keeps me going
[6:13:54] JakeStratic: Warhammer Online > WOW > Rift. Rift had issues with dungeons. Warhammer lacked dungeons & raids.
[6:13:58] Elceecruz04: Didnt you love New World?
[6:13:58] ReignXCV: new world
[6:14:00] mightycylon: New World

[6:14:06] Homewrecka: wildstar was mis managed by NCSoft
[6:14:07] Largefingerr: new world is dank
[6:14:08] Viccili: archeage was sick outside of pay to win
[6:14:09] faded1896: @Doxtater115 Pepega
[6:14:10] thief753: ALBION?
[6:14:11] mikewantshelp: how about lost ark?
[6:14:12] Legallyunaware: aion was my jam
[6:14:12] insaniity: a lil bit of lost ark @shroud
[6:14:13] RedwingXD: @shroud GW2 is worth checking out again they did some goo changes
[6:14:14] Lokeptt: archeage was my favorite but so P2W
[6:14:17] itsrambo: Archeage 2 comes out in a year or so on UE5 hopefully not so pay to win
[6:14:20] Braxius: the cutscenes
[6:14:21] shynomai: Archeage has a decent private server
[6:14:23] roh_hard: Riot MMO will be good
[6:14:27] Iamnuby: graphics could use an update to be fair
[6:14:27] ViewbotBloke: City of Heroes is/was the best for me.
[6:14:33] eskrima_ian: @shroud Yo spot testing in AoC has started. you think you'll stream alpha2?
[6:14:33] ReignXCV: @roh_hard should be*

[6:14:55] Myltra: @Alias2552 yeah hope we are still alive lmao
[6:14:55] c3rby_: Final fantasy, the game where people accept 200 ms delay for raid mechanics as fact
[6:14:57] TallGuy_Joshy: @Alias2552 Hoping it never happens KEKW
[6:15:00] Largefingerr: new world is the only MMO ive enjoyed besides wow
[6:15:07] Homewrecka: azeroth was also designed VERY well
[6:15:10] Keiichi__: NCSoft had a WoW killer, but then the exec's/bean counters screwed it up
[6:15:17] orangemaple24: wow has almost no loading screen and most new mmo do
[6:15:22] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: True
[6:15:22] willy_xvi: LOTRO !!
[6:15:22] pontocore: @pakamov does not sound accurate at all. its materials with high dencitiy and have ”slow” transformation of energy that makes good/bad insulation.
[6:15:23] kindaopmusic: guildwars 2 is really good too
[6:15:24] WATCHMECARRYLOL: poe2 looks hellaaaa fresh ho leeeeeeeeeee
[6:15:26] constantinetwitch91: @shroud thank you .... fking random lights doesnt make for a nice skill///

[6:15:28] Cheezburglar804: @shroud did you ever play that 'wild planet' or whatever mmo  that one was interesting
[6:15:34] Xxsickheadxx: what do you think about lost ark?
[6:15:35] pokirane: lost ark has the best action combat. come at me chat.
[6:15:37] AntDX3162: We need AI to fulfill that itch perfectly.
[6:15:39] kerchuu: how i feel with ff14, it feels like my characters legs just move and the model slides
[6:15:42] Homewrecka: ff14 is trash
[6:15:42] BillianTv: BillianTv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 3 months, nice to be here
[6:15:51] JakeStratic: Yep. Graphics don't need to be perfect. I'm okay with toon or real... but i need fluidity.
[6:15:51] c3rby_: Nah, the gameplay is dookie. everyone plays for story
[6:15:53] ReignXCV: leg movement/running animation
[6:15:56] just_lurkingg: same reason cod was so dominant compared to other shooters, the polish
[6:15:57] MrSr3nity_97: What about PoE?
[6:15:58] mikewantshelp: Lost ark was the most grindy  pay to win annoying game I have ever played

[6:16:27] smcoffey: to be fair shroud that game ffxiv engine was designed to run on ps3 which had 256mb of memory not 8gb not 16gb
[6:16:30] c3rby_: Riot mmo prob gonna be BIG
[6:16:30] siyam2777708: Ha broke
[6:16:30] bootycheeker: in WoW you move on the terrain. in a lot of other mmos the terrain looks like it’s moving under you and you’re running in place
[6:16:31] Stickypanini: EZ send it
[6:16:32] yaldzz: where do they drop?
[6:16:33] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud

[6:17:33] Weebey48: Does anyone know if Shroud has shared his UI Script?
[6:17:33] Hene83: its not 100% change to get the item from those shredders btw
[6:17:35] Dopey: ofc
[6:17:42] Fusez_: heavy leather is mad expensive
[6:17:46] cykelbudet: Good morning from Finland shruud!
[6:17:50] romdall1: @kh0nan idk about that. missign a shadowcrash feels so bad
[6:17:52] c3rby_: ye
[6:17:57] JakeStratic: The worst part is that... storm strike isn't available. So all you're getting is 5% increased hit chance?
[6:18:00] romdall1: or a meteor
[6:18:01] Fusez_: get leatherworker to make heavy leather for 5 medium leather each
[6:18:04] Stickypanini: I got 14 from 28 tries
[6:18:10] Voksx: you need heavy leather for the salvager unit
[6:18:17] Dopey: im in gromgol rn where are you
[6:18:18] kh0nan: @kh0nan you land a frostbolt and its like 30% of a mobs health, in retail its like 10%
[6:18:19] holeace: Didn't your buddy say he can make?
[6:18:21] DirtySusan: Streamer powars!!!
[6:18:26] jayonyx_: sorry bro im mobile right now
[6:18:32] SirPsychoLucky: Any advice for a new player that wants to be a tank? I feel like people will complain a lot if I dont know all the exact and perfect pulls and everything.
[6:18:33] maaeestroo: Jokerd got 14 from 16 triest tho
[6:18:33] dpetkov354: Where does the Dark Iron Ordinance drop?
[6:18:47] yazanmh95: ngl the way your voice vibrates in my ears it turns me on bro
[6:18:51] JoaEUW: @kh0nan ????? what haha

[6:18:57] Elceecruz04: Any gold givers in the chat?

[6:19:20] sneakydeaky1995: or amazon maybe
[6:19:23] Dopey: not a lot
[6:19:29] feel03: fish oil is the easy part
[6:19:33] kh0nan: @kh0nan in retail you have 20 spells you can press to do damage, naturally each one has less impact individually compared to classic spells, where one will do significantly more damage
[6:19:42] SirPsychoLucky: @SirPsychoLucky I feel bad tho because I dont want to make people lose time with me learning the mechanics :(
[6:20:07] zerouzaria: all these streamers are ally i appreciate you're horde
[6:20:11] Mabumaru: NomNom NomNom NomNom NomNom NomNom NomNom VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay copyThis copyThis copyThis copyThis copyThis copyThis pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat
[6:20:16] JoaEUW: @kh0nan That's because in retail you have a rotation that fits together a bunch of spells in order to have a skill progression in a spec. In classic it's 1 ability spam buddy
[6:20:17] romdall1: @SirPsychoLucky that's why you tell them up front first an if they have an issue just go next
[6:20:39] xolossus00: EU is horde
[6:20:41] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud

[6:21:08] FlipperRumble: lol cuz asmond and esfand overloaded alliance
[6:21:11] RitanRitual: So glad the streamers I watch are horde
[6:21:12] ThatSneakyRussian: @shroud primarily cause Alliance is just content/mechanically better. Now horde has access to alliance tools.
[6:21:20] euly999: Peeka is on ally
[6:21:20] JoaEUW: @kh0nan Hard to not gotcha you when you tell the difference is 30% frostbolt vs 10% frostbolt like huh
[6:21:25] Iol69: its literally just like asmon and xqc on alliance and they both are gonna quit in a week
[6:21:25] runer_2xc: yea alliance was locked very quicly
[6:21:26] Shock_2k: same.  Every server I was on always was ally heavy since 2004.
[6:21:27] JerryRages: What server did you end up on for horde @shroud?
[6:21:29] romdall1: you only really have esfand and asmon for alliance
[6:21:31] JakeStratic: Alliance toons got locked down before the end of day 1 on Crusader realm
[6:21:31] ThatSneakyRussian: SOD Made Horde competitive

[6:23:00] Aj_Bamf: paladin looks huge
[6:23:00] JakeStratic: I'm only aware of you and one MoonMoon who is horde. Everyone else i've seen on twitch is alliance.
[6:23:01] mawkkek: MITCH of he counts

[6:23:30] DirtySusan: in IRL and Wow
[6:23:31] ReadyPlayerJesse: fat crits are where its at with pallys

[6:25:13] conflictonn: when next ashenvale event?
[6:25:16] Steadmoh190: ah
[6:25:17] masterkiefg: is now a bad time to start getting into wow
[6:25:23] Thurggot: the 400ms batch window captures both seals
[6:25:26] preyloo: @M4sterPe4ce perfect time to get into it now when level is restricted to 25 and there is just so much u can do :D
[6:25:27] donhuanxinfinite: that sounds op

[6:26:01] insaniity: thing is if that wasn't in the game, ret pallies would be even more ass in classic @shroud
[6:26:02] Sidraco_: isn't boring to not have mounts for all the first phase?
[6:26:06] bp6i9: Getting into any mmo when everyone is playing is the best time to get into a mmo!

[6:26:30] donhuanxinfinite: what class did much dps in bc
[6:26:46] kerchuu: if blizz was against seal twisting they woulda already fixed it
[6:26:47] clyffch: paladin already competes without twiusting
[6:26:53] Steadmoh190: but arent paladins buffed now in sod?
[6:26:59] JakeStratic: I think they just balanced it instead of relying on the bug. McConnel was dominating the raid DPS as a pally

[6:30:19] PartialPersian: EQ v EQ2?
[6:30:27] JakeStratic: I think this has the chance to be wow 2. If it goes well. IF it doesn't go well it'll be an arcade.
[6:30:27] dragu_on: wow 2 is not an option for blizz in many years from now

[7:15:19] Drink69: @SotisTsoglanis Leveling two chars = no life? Considering how easy it is to level novadays you are very wrong.  And btw, leveling WoW characters beats work so if you have nothing better to do then work, get a life!.. lol
[7:15:20] DoubleKillDan: hows the ICC grind been treating ya
[7:15:22] FrankXTyler: o o o onclers ??? ooo

[7:15:29] flashnickgg: @PsyNytes sup mod shroudWave shroudLove
[7:15:29] itsrambo: anxiety rush
[7:15:30] camslam: agreed
[7:15:32] JakeStratic: hardcore is fun to watch death but I could never do it for classic because no PVP
[7:15:34] SIVIoke_: the pressure in the chest if u do die tho not worth it
[7:15:35] DlSPEL_: yea hardcore is trash
[7:15:36] saggert: glutton for punishment
[7:15:37] ValhallaCalls_: tbh its more fun for me cause all the players u group with are statistically goign to be better
[7:15:39] PsyNytes: shroudCute
[7:15:42] JeyEn: different kind of fun
[7:15:44] Huso833: The time loss is crazy tbh

[7:16:06] ApexxLegend42O: @sotistsoglanis the way you're so defensive is hillarious
[7:16:08] Pizzle_6: RuneScape hardcore is hell
[7:16:10] Ellen_Degenerate69: D4 bad
[7:16:18] Jaskaran158: Personally ironman mode > HC
[7:16:21] ValhallaCalls_: its like 3 days game time for 60 tbh
[7:16:21] Ptoocw: @SotisTsoglanis You could also be using your time more efficiently then argueing with some people in a twitch chat.
[7:16:23] blue_sunriseGC: my problem with hardcore wow is it goes against lore i mean we have healers who can res dead peopls it makes no sense in the game setting lore wise
[7:16:26] kskywlkr: @SotisTsoglanis you're on a different end of the kruger curve than you think
[7:16:28] alastrarz: it is after a couple of deaths if your are high level
[7:16:28] keijihanda: D4 is not hardcore.... has stupid potion and scroll...
[7:16:29] PsyNytes: @SotisTsoglanis Seems like it makes you mad. I'd suggest clicking off the stream if multiboxing is upsetting you.
[7:16:29] flashnickgg: @FINXCO shroudWave shroudLove sup fin
[7:16:33] JakeStratic: D4 is a solo game. You can be self-reliant, and there is no real PVP. So Hardcore is fun. Vanilla is OPPOSITE
[7:16:35] Gnumm: soda watched a clip earlier of someone dying with thunderfury
[7:16:51] PsyNytes: Mmk time to end the trolling

[7:18:18] Drink69: @SotisTsoglanis Yes leveling WoW characters beats work, sitting in the sofa watching TV beats work. Work is THE worst but i still do it to pay my bills and buy food. If i could do something else i would do ANYTHING rather then working.

[10:18:49] SubaBaba: guys is that classic or retail ?
[10:18:52] CottonsocksWoW: are we thinking gnomereggan will be the level 40 raid? or will it be RFD?
[10:18:52] chris777ian: do you pvp in wow?
[10:18:53] DraXXtreme: does BFD drops trinkets ?
[10:18:56] Wolfinosg: it might be even worth for exp
[10:19:03] Munch1616: @DraXXtreme  Ya caster trinket.
[10:19:06] kajjan112: if they give hit ppl will use em at 60 :>
[10:19:06] HeyAmAK: @shroud is there an export of ya nameplates somewhere?
[10:19:07] Nyxblow: @DraXXtreme yes very good trinkets for all roles
[10:19:07] Gnumm: i think gnomer already confirmed?
[10:19:09] stekarmalen: That epic staff is so good
[10:19:09] Schemon: @CottonsocksWoW thought they confirmed 40?
[10:19:14] Mikitzu: @SubaBaba neither, it's season of discovery
[10:19:25] shadowkhancmp: You think 40 will be Gnomer and SM or one over the other?
[10:19:27] CottonsocksWoW: @schemon its been hinted. not confirmed as far as im aware
[10:19:29] SubaBaba: @Mikitzu thanks for info bro
[10:19:29] antm9: @shroud why did i just get my first rune and it feels like christmas morning

[10:19:34] Salcar33: HOW IS WOW BETTER THAN NEWWORLD????????????????????
[10:19:44] editmrots: @Salcar33 it always has been
[10:19:48] kage_gaara_: i can see it already in my mind "LFM BFD MIN LVL 30"
[10:19:53] paperinoo: min-maxers will do it for world buff i guess
[10:19:54] Kas50: @Salcar33 very different, NW more action based combat
[10:19:56] lovespeakeasy: @Salcar33 lemme play an mmo with only humans ResidentSleeper
[10:19:57] CottonsocksWoW: @shadowkhancmp scarlett dungeons as one mega raid would be fucking insane!!!
[10:20:01] nitrovert: OMG the beard
[10:20:04] Whitefangddy: i've already been getting lvl 28 gear by farming murlocs
[10:20:07] zebusmack: NEW OMEGALUL RLD
[10:20:14] stekarmalen: ID rather that then to throw the raid oute the window once we 40
[10:20:24] Munch1616: @shroud  Your wrong all if it will be replaced by lvl 40.
[10:20:28] heavensinterlude: i love when you play wow very relaxing
[10:20:29] lramos1252: my nose
[10:20:33] espi: BFD 5-man at 40
[10:20:33] sotacole: And That Would Help Auction House Value Stay Nicer
[10:20:37] weakdeltoidd: COMPLETELY TRUE, in retail there is no reason to grind previous tiers / items
[10:20:45] stekarmalen: Add "heroic" mode for the bosses?
[10:20:49] abovetheskyxxx: how are you doing shroud
[10:20:50] conflag: two clients at once: against ToS
[10:20:51] Theo_Leve: is it 7am there? its 2pm here in Greece.

[10:21:01] liverpoolfc8888: What is on hardcore mode? This version of WoW or shrouds beared? xD
[10:21:01] Praxism: same
[10:21:02] Helios_a: I agree
[10:21:03] espi: just make it a 5-man for 40's, easy
[10:21:07] CottonsocksWoW: unless they make clearing the raid mandatory to clear to give you gear to kill the bigger mobs!
[10:21:10] Praxism: so much work went into some of that stuff too
[10:21:11] Alaziara: SWTOR does that, but swtor only has like 8 raids
[10:21:13] Rafaatho: @Theo_Leve 4am
[10:21:17] Tenivir: in retail everything gets replaced each patch ye
[10:21:20] weakdeltoidd: every patch and xpac they introduce in retail invalidates the last
[10:21:22] MindOfPaul: Final Fantasy XIV does a good job of putting players back in old content
[10:21:25] Asphoron: Chromie Time
[10:21:33] MrLupin: Shroud still live!? Pog
[10:21:38] paliaco: DUEL WIELD
[10:21:39] antm9: a little horizontal progress would be super sick in retail
[10:21:42] fhm_91: like cod, realized after 13 parts to bring back part 3
[10:21:46] stekarmalen: I just cant wait for lvl 30 when sham gets Windfury
[10:21:48] CottonsocksWoW: @shroud the raid will always be relevant in SoD because you need items from there to get runes
[10:21:48] Nilyndd: You could do something like NW does and have 'mutating' raids
[10:21:48] Gnumm: the last time that was the case was wrath and they said they didnt like having people feeling like they had to go back to old content for gear
[10:22:02] Gnumm: so no luck with that coming back FeelsBadMan
[10:22:03] Darkryx: mage

[10:23:48] CottonsocksWoW: @ghostyll infinite mana near enough, its insanely good
[10:23:49] Praxism: people will go back to old content for gear if it's the highest end gear in the current iteration of the game
[10:23:50] Ostrichmen: I have a feeling a lot of the people saying ulduar was great did not just play it again in wotlk classic just now
[10:23:50] chicken0o: pre vezax trash is the worst thing in entire wow
[10:23:51] necro793: 10mins ×25

[10:23:58] 5hay: karazhan was fun
[10:24:00] MRRowdyRuff: lock tanking sfk is hella fun
[10:24:08] Gnumm: thats why hardmodes only lasted one tier
[10:24:11] Ghostyll: @CottonsocksWoW Nice! ty fore the info!
[10:24:12] qwafflesnsyrup: awful raid, made me quit wotlk

[10:24:26] KN0T_RE3L: rediscovering wow blows bag
[10:24:27] AlleviateWoW: ulduar single handedly made hardcore popular bc all the dad guilds quit wrath.
