[1:50:03] Sollice: @d2darkalliance So US wins its a blizzard screw up joke?
[1:50:08] Coriollis: hope method does good so maybe a 3 way race?
[1:50:09] Wulfgrym: @Sollice most doctors still use the charts i find, its just unrealistic, im 395 but i don't look mega heavy, for me ideal weight with weight training should be around 260 which should be me lean and in super shape. just gotta get my old ass there, just went for test blood tests and looking at alternatives to ozempic if i need meds.

[2:05:41] Rottencoarse: i feel for Dan dont get me wrong i loved his casting for method
[2:05:43] 91Niki: It's okay to be bummed. But you can say voice that differently "Bummed I didn't get picked, but super excited and happy for those who did"
[2:05:57] Rottencoarse: @Sollice oh yeah %100 on that

[2:18:50] Sollice: @TheJus10Bean Give me 3 raid tiers, sub patches with lore and expansions every 18 months and I am good
[2:18:50] Breakernaut: Which isn't bad. If they can get consistent work done on not just the next xpac but the one after too
[2:19:03] PidiaP: Wowhead armchair devs and executives are the best!
[2:19:07] Rudric_Ice: @Sollice this might be a hot take but i hate the art direction for the dragons in dragonflight
[2:19:09] Syllvn: Also you don't have to spend $90 xD
[2:19:15] Nerendis: "I refuse to by TBC - er WOTLK --- ERRR PANDA.... ER Shadowlands... Fuck I keep playing wow
[2:19:16] scramperlive: its only like 40-50 a year if you dont buy the big whammy version
[2:19:28] manbehrpigg: exactly
[2:19:32] mavericks312: my question is how big will base midnight and last titan be
[2:19:34] zeotkeili: doesnt matter what blizzard does. some people will find something to complain about
[2:19:34] Coriollis: I hope they can keep this 1 year and some months xpansion pace
[2:19:37] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice Nah art is never a hot take. Art is subjective you like it or you don't. Can't really be wrong about what you like for art
[2:19:41] akia03: or did they split 1 xpac into 3?
[2:19:47] manbehrpigg: also $90 is not mandated lol
[2:19:50] Nevindaz: so.. we will not have another fated season?
[2:19:53] galandsobe: Hello
[2:19:58] Heatsen: How often did they say that and how often did they do not deliver
[2:19:59] Shrenko: if we get content like 10.2 I dont want this cycle
[2:20:00] futomara01: ill believe it when i see it
[2:20:03] Sollice: We are having a fated this this expansion yes
[2:20:04] Heatsen: mindlblowing believing that stuff
[2:20:05] Nerendis: @Nevindaz we will
[2:20:10] Nokterian: i paid for a year sub and i will do it every year
[2:20:12] PvtHudson093: I hope not
[2:20:21] scumlucki: lemme preorder all the new expansions at once 0.0
[2:20:31] neftario105: I buy the retail expansion
[2:20:31] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[2:20:33] valianya: They can let the Team working on 12 take time to learn and train up.  Because 11 is a senior team so is ready to go.  By the time 12 and 13 come, the Spellbreak team will be trained up.  And by the launch of 11 the more senior team can check over 12 progress
[2:20:38] Bourbons86: i play all 3 versions now, and know that im playing whatever they come up with. The only thing I didn't play was season of mastery, but I play retail, hardcore, and wotlk classic :)
[2:20:39] Laelas_sm: crazy to think in a years time there will be a team working on whatever comes AFTER the world soul saga
[2:20:48] N3llee: @Towelliee they've said this stuff in the past and failed to deliver. Naturally people skeptical. In addition there is a fear of the content coming sooner means less content in general and we see this Dragonflight now getting one less raid.
[2:20:51] segarth: I forgot I had a 1 year sub going and it just renewed lol
[2:20:58] Breakernaut: @Heatsen A lot of us are hoping that now that they are owned by MS and out from under Activision that things will actually get better...might be copium

[2:20:59] PvtHudson093: I like picking the best gear from 3 raids with Dinars
[2:21:00] wwishie: The expansion police will come
[2:21:07] scumlucki: @segarth minus 100 bucks
[2:21:22] cptrogers123: Dragonflight was mid
[2:21:27] Unloved_Grandma: Just started wow lol I‚Äôm ready the journey
[2:21:29] N3llee: But does a new season mean a less raid tier?
[2:21:33] Bourbons86: the community has to admit that even the worst of blizzard expansions are still better than any other mmo on the market
[2:21:35] N3llee: cause they said 3 raid tiers per xpac
[2:21:36] Sarocus: 10 years ago, there was a thing they didn't deliver reeee
[2:22:09] PvtHudson093: I hope we still get 4 seasons an expac
[2:22:16] ArcaneSyntax: Imagine if the fates m+ is just the 8 launch dungeons.
[2:22:26] N3llee: So is the fated raid the 3rd raid or the forth?
[2:22:32] Nokterian: delves being the new standard on those who not wanna do raids or m+
[2:22:33] Sollice: this is third raid
[2:22:37] Sollice: fated will be next
[2:22:38] nekros0day: You think well ever see guild halls?
[2:22:52] SamuraiWillZ916: TRIGGERED!!!
[2:22:52] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:22:53] cptrogers123: Instead of a 4th tier, we are getting shitty fated seasons....
[2:22:58] EarlofCockwood: then Iridikron will be the tier 1 endboss of the war within?
[2:23:01] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  https://twitter.com/chefheidiLA/status/1723382171975475606 holy shit liquid's catering is going to be top notch
[2:23:02] MackPlays: Give him homework Lula!
[2:23:04] scumlucki: BOMBS???
[2:23:15] scumlucki: everybody get down !!
[2:23:21] TheJus10Bean: yea fated seasons are trash
[2:23:31] polaropposite76: twas short
[2:23:33] Nokterian: GOOSE!
[2:23:43] polaropposite76: yeah 57
[2:23:43] Cabbageman007: Colts 57+
[2:23:48] valianya: @towelliee The only thing I'm concerned about is the expansions becoming too formulaic and doubling down on the formula instead of allowing more creativity.  Shadowlands was them doubling down on the Legion formula too much.
[2:23:49] Eyedolize08: is that an addon that tells you when people die? lol
[2:24:16] Squats3: @Rottencoarse not quite catering - team liquid has a personal chef.
[2:24:22] akia03: wonder how they will balance sod pvp
[2:24:24] Cabbageman007: Colts killing themselves..penalty earlier took em out of FG range
[2:24:26] PvtHudson093: new evergreen systems
[2:24:34] Nerendis: Can someone tell me when halftime is over
[2:24:42] Breakernaut: I think DF has shown they can get creative while following a formula
[2:24:43] Aidler: no more fated raids after DF would be sadge. it was the best raiding experience in a long time
[2:25:19] UltraKSlaya: I am looking forward to Delves!
[2:25:26] BoringBrit: ESO has open world delves
[2:25:30] Poriand: i really hope delves end up giving atleast like heroic raid gear
[2:25:32] Bourbons86: fax
[2:25:40] Sollice: anal
[2:25:40] c0mmander_starscream: WoW 2
[2:25:41] Vile_: Yeah, I'm honestly looking forward to delves.
[2:25:44] SpratsTV: blizz have always taken things from other games and improved
[2:25:46] Bourbons86: we had garrisons tho
[2:25:47] actually_pierce: hey mate are you playing HC with coh?
[2:25:47] Sollice: Thats what WoW needs to try...anal
[2:25:49] UltraKSlaya: Warbands is def something the game desperately needed!
[2:25:51] Squats3: Blasphemy!
[2:25:52] Nevindaz: I mean
[2:25:53] Coriollis: is a diablo 2 system tbh not LA , proly warband will go into housing
[2:25:57] scaffoldpatriot: well, they did garrisons
[2:25:58] cripplious: vr wow
[2:25:59] vetbro: WoW players = Insufferable. Can't please everyone...
[2:25:59] neverbornlucky: Towelliee I said it first  Delves RUINED wow
[2:26:00] brentosxd: The blizzard way is copying other MMO's and making it better
[2:26:00] MackPlays: People make the craziest assumptions from minimal information
[2:26:07] Breakernaut: And it's what started WoW. Take what works from others and refine it for a more casual player base.
[2:26:11] ZeNoNoVa: True!
[2:26:12] DeleldurTV: Crazy theory   Wow classic WAS wow 2
[2:26:15] Nerendis: Only reason I want WoW 2 is because it will be a ground up new engine @Towelliee
[2:26:17] Alienfromger: wow 2 with ue5 and rtx and shit
[2:26:20] Calphurnious: @BoringBrit Yeah, I like them. Only difference is only your party is in the WoW delve
[2:26:26] TheItalianStallion321: dont put that evil on us Ricky Towel, dont you put that evil on us!
[2:26:28] Nevindaz: the thing is they should add more horizontal progg systems
[2:26:28] Sollice: Blizzard will never use UE
[2:26:32] dracullus: well same with GTA 6, you will drive and shoot people
[2:26:39] iccyc0ld: and pvp
[2:26:43] zeotkeili: if the formula works, why change it?
[2:26:45] Coriollis: @Sollice u say that but new Anduin cinematic
[2:26:47] scramperlive: speaking of ESO, endless archives is lit
[2:26:48] Nevindaz: like the delves are the first step
[2:26:49] 91Niki: That's the thing tho, people want them to reinvent the mmo genre
[2:26:50] iccyc0ld: right whatever suits their taste
[2:26:51] valianya: They're almost certainly looking into how they can create code systems that will allow housing
[2:27:02] Sollice: What about the new Anduin cinematic
[2:27:03] doogs44: WOW need to steal huttball from SWTOR.
[2:27:04] cptrogers123: Riot is the new blizzard
[2:27:22] mavericks312: taht warband announment is still the best thing from blizzcon
[2:27:27] c0mmander_starscream: Yeap
[2:27:31] Coriollis: is made with UE assets
[2:27:32] Snackyy23: im excited theres an open world end game now with Delves
[2:27:35] Nerendis: Ghostcrawler took WAY more than I thought he did
[2:27:35] Tranquil_Dragon: It's all just personal preference.
[2:27:36] Calphurnious: @cptrogers123 meh, LoL went backwards after the summoners rift reskin
[2:27:36] TheItalianStallion321: i heard Riot MMO is like...3-4 years away
[2:27:51] Shrenko: I have a feeling Riot mmo wont happen too
[2:27:53] MackPlays: I‚Äôm not worried about them I got no investment
[2:28:05] Sollice: @Coriollis Where did you see that?
[2:28:07] c0mmander_starscream: I would not be surprised Riot's MMO is put on a shelf
[2:28:10] Nerendis: That's because we don't listen Towelliee
[2:28:10] mavericks312: he took a couple riot ppl too
[2:28:14] bendeurama: hey hey classic! what server?
[2:28:15] A_Procell: Any interest in the Pax Dei Alpha coming up?
[2:28:15] Nebulizer87: that netease money must be good lol
[2:28:16] papaherc: Netease has deep pocket books too, so im excited to see what ghostcrawler and his team comes up with
[2:28:19] Squats3: @Coriollis not assets... engine.
[2:28:19] ArcaneSyntax: riot's the new blizzard in that they are completely subserviant to a chinese company.
[2:28:22] scumlucki: they left to go make an instanced mmo
[2:28:28] Breakernaut: I wouldn't be suprised if Samwise "retired" than comes back to either Ghostcrawlers team or the Stormgate devs
[2:28:35] Nokterian: Samwise Didier just left blizzard
[2:28:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: i got a email that the Pax Dai alpha is happening soon
[2:28:51] z1xt3r: why did he leave ?
[2:28:53] dbird901: i'd have left Riot too
[2:28:55] c0mmander_starscream: Maybe Riot will pilfer Ashes of Creation devs LUL LUL LUL
[2:28:55] valianya: Was Netease responsible for Diablo Immortal monetization?
[2:29:08] Squats3: @z1xt3r he moved to texas and then they wanted to go back to office
[2:29:11] souleymaster: new MMO ?
[2:29:14] Coriollis: @Sollice the skeleton movement is UE asset , @Squats3 there was no full engine just bits
[2:29:24] scumlucki: ashes of creation alpha 2 sometime next year
[2:29:31] valianya: I still worry
[2:29:34] FusionKissMe: we will see...
[2:29:40] z1xt3r: @Squats3 what ?
[2:29:42] Sollice: @Coriollis Post a link for that. How could you use a UE asset in a non UE environment
[2:29:43] Rudric_Ice: kinda weird that chris metzen moved in and sam left
[2:29:45] Squats3: @Coriollis bro the are in pre production.. do you want them to have full art assets and shit...
[2:29:47] mavericks312: lets see about that 2 yrs after launch
[2:29:49] Merex760: Riot messed up pushing them to return to office. So they gotta live with that choice losing all that talent
[2:30:05] scramperlive: Yeah, companies like that dont just give money out with no strings other than RoI - there is something else in there
[2:30:15] Sollice: Blizzard has a cinematic team.....It's not the staff making the game
[2:30:18] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @battl3gaming (warning)
[2:30:20] Merex760: Yep fully remote
[2:30:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: its ghostcrawlers pool house
[2:30:26] c0mmander_starscream: lol how do you project manage that
[2:30:28] ladymissalice: they can use their accountant's office as business address
[2:30:28] mavericks312: there building is GC's basement lol
[2:30:28] Nebulizer87: yeah he said they gonna stay full remote to make the game will be interesting
[2:30:29] Breakernaut: @Rudric_Ice Not really. Both have been working for the company for 30+ years. It's just about that time when you wanna do something new
[2:30:30] valianya: Was Netease the ones who refused to renew for China WoW licensing?
[2:30:31] segarth: They have a meeting at Starbucks every Monday lol
[2:30:33] iccyc0ld: Good for the employees to deduct home office expenses
[2:30:39] Coriollis: @Sollice no link sorry there are discussions in art places, sorry if I overstepped
[2:30:41] Sollice: OK we got the spamming
[2:30:43] K4mro: hmmm what about someone's garage instead of house, like all those big companies started ;)
[2:30:46] souleymaster: really Ghostcrawler making new MMO
[2:31:10] valrash1981: Steven Seagull, watch out he'll kick your arse for some fries.

[2:31:20] Sollice: It's not an overstep, but I have NEVER heard of Blizzard using ANYTHING other than in house for everything they do. And they have their own cinematics team who specifically does tha
[2:31:27] Merex760: Im interested in the concept of switching from private shards to MMO shards
[2:31:30] finalfear55: Feel dumb I don't know this but what addon allows you to zoom so far?
[2:31:33] Nerendis: Project Titan would have been it man
[2:31:37] scumlucki: ew shooter mmos
[2:31:37] dbird901: a better Destiny 2 is much needed
[2:31:39] mavericks312: i mean that would make sense the way the characters looked
[2:31:47] Molvonos: Morning folks
[2:31:51] Jakmuiz: titan was overwatch
[2:31:52] segarth: Oh yah.The destiny killer (not that it needs help being killed)
[2:31:56] valianya: A shooter superhero mmo?
[2:32:03] Merex760: Could be a third person shooter MMO
[2:32:03] nekros0day: wasent titan just overwatch?
[2:32:04] Nebulizer87: or they get inspired by Wildstar combat
[2:32:07] Rayvon_Lunatic: miss firefall
[2:32:08] brentosxd: So like destiny?
[2:32:10] Squats3: Every class does one thing
[2:32:14] valrash1981: Survival Looter Shooter mmo?
[2:32:26] Nerendis: @nekros0day titan was a full blown mmo that got massively paired down into overwatch
[2:32:28] c0mmander_starscream: it's cheaper for them to make a tower defense shooter
[2:32:29] PvtHudson093: I hope its not another live service game
[2:32:30] valrash1981: Not much for 3rd person shooters though.
[2:32:33] N3llee: talking about GC game? Sorry had to answer the door
[2:32:43] iccyc0ld: What's your opinion on Destiny?
[2:32:51] Davedaman26: Their is a report out that says that Microsoft wants Blizzard to start working on those old projects like Titan
[2:32:53] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[2:32:56] N3llee: TRUE
[2:33:02] EVSW2324: "towel the tank"
[2:33:23] c0mmander_starscream: Meh OW
[2:33:34] Squats3: Sounds like what guild wars tried to do at the start
[2:33:37] valianya: Not going to compete with WoW for the king of fantasy mmo, but willing to try to dethrone Destiny?
[2:33:42] segarth: They seem a bit too ambitious and I fear it will be too big to pull off, as a smaller studio.
[2:33:43] stagturtle: I thought more of a Lost Ark Tank approach
[2:33:56] c0mmander_starscream: Star Craft RPG Hype
[2:33:57] scramperlive: Starcraft Ghost: REMASTERED
[2:33:57] ScurvyHyam: Starcraft MMO?
[2:34:04] Coriollis: sc mobile aware

[2:34:09] manu_forti_: starcraft mmo could be interesting
[2:34:16] Nokterian: Phil also loves many games from the activision vault my hope to see a bunch of games coming out of there
[2:34:21] Merex760: I think the next Starcraft game will be like a Destiny type thing
[2:34:23] valrash1981: As long as they're not trying to rake us over the coals money wise, things getting tight.
[2:34:26] segarth: A Diablo souls like is my dream game
[2:34:28] brentosxd: I don't think blizzard wants 2 mmo's
[2:34:34] c0mmander_starscream: Elder Scrolls -Star Craft
[2:34:35] Aidler: Phil bought Blizzard because he wants a new Starcraft‚Ä¶ lol
[2:34:42] XLcoj: Warcraft rumble ?:D
[2:34:45] ArcaneSyntax: I think a starcraft RPG might be cool
[2:34:47] Talk_Nerdy_2Me: which game release first; the RIOT MMO or whatever Blizzars secret Sandbox survival game is
[2:34:48] scumlucki: World of starcraft when?
[2:35:11] neftario105: I'm at the theater going to watch the marvels
[2:35:18] Breakernaut: Whoever was saying the new cinematic was UE5 you're wrong. ANduin was modeled and rigged in Maya
[2:35:26] c0mmander_starscream: Star Scrolls
[2:35:28] Squats3: I feel like that would be huge in korea
[2:35:29] TLew02: Have we heard anymore about the survival game they are supposedly working on?
[2:35:29] Starclassics: need a new command and conquer
[2:35:30] Poriand: rts mobile game next
[2:35:31] actually_pierce: RTS weren't niche, now they are
[2:35:34] Nerendis: 19
[2:35:37] valrash1981: I like a good RTS though lmao.
[2:35:44] doukas201gr: MercyWing1 MercyWing2
[2:35:50] boone__daddy: command and conquer lol
[2:35:50] tiejuandoemaster: StarCraft 1st person shooter
[2:35:54] Ledeanna: Microsoft supports RTS look at Age of Empires Remasters and new game.
[2:36:01] scramperlive: I think a new starcraft would need to be very very "eye candy" to be compelling. Super well optimized, amazing graphics, and spectacular big army and fleet battles with no chug, no frame dip.
[2:36:07] neftario105: True
[2:36:12] segarth: If they do a good job any genre can hit hard. BG3 proved that.
[2:36:16] manu_forti_: Stockings also run
[2:36:20] valrash1981: @tiejuandoemaster I think that was supposed to be Ghost, but got canned.
[2:36:23] ArcaneMaki: Yes RTS weren't niche at all 15-20 years ago, but now they lost their appeal a bit.
[2:36:26] tiejuandoemaster: Ouuu first person shooter mmo starcraft
[2:36:32] c0mmander_starscream: @scramperlive Todd Howard working on it
[2:36:34] Breakernaut: A warcraft crpg O.o that'd be dope
[2:36:35] valianya: I wonder if Microsoft will see about handing Starcraft to another studio team because current Blizzard doesn't have a team that are on top of RTS anymore
[2:37:01] kodtheog: riots mmo
[2:37:08] MackPlays: StarCraft wont be Rts anymore like Warcraft
[2:37:08] N3llee: Super excited for the future of WoW. it looks bright.
[2:37:14] scumlucki: only one im hyped for is ashes
[2:37:15] c0mmander_starscream: Star Citizen too slootCopium
[2:37:16] Nokterian: They never mentioned Starcraft of Heroes of the Storm during the opening
[2:37:18] segarth: HOTS classic is gonna be great in 2026 danCopium
[2:37:21] the_hoff_man: Thats Dansgaming
[2:37:24] neftario105: ESO I used to play it but now I don't even look to it the game is crap

[2:37:47] Harok9: dann <3
[2:37:54] Sollice: Did they lose the vertically thing
[2:38:04] LolPandaMan: danHug
[2:38:13] MackPlays: Isn‚Äôt that just normal production process
[2:38:25] N3llee: Throne and Liberty looks interesting but worried about the typical KR pay for power and convenience stuff. Their director admitted in a interview they will have some.
[2:38:28] Allsee_: We Just waiting on Pantheon now
[2:38:35] segarth: Yah. Microsoft will focus on activision and especially King. They can let blizzard do what it wants pretty much. They were after mobile gaming and CoD
[2:38:45] manu_forti_: day before next delay
[2:38:50] Poriand: i need that player housing
[2:38:54] valianya: I'm excited to see what they do with their survival game

[3:57:05] TheItalianStallion321: exactly. high bar to set
[3:57:10] mavericks312: the mets have a chance to be in last place next year

[3:58:23] chocobobo16: lmfao
[3:58:26] TheItalianStallion321: the Mets imploded...traded everyone. Buck had to go. now we have the Yankees bench coach as manager. Counsell ran far away from the Mets
[3:58:35] secretzor: do you think the MLB will ever have a salary cap?
[3:58:43] inspirationalbodallas: Cashman being removed? lol

[4:03:04] mcatx2: @Towelliee Thoughts on the Mavs season so far.  2nd in the west
[4:03:04] daconcion: Sounds like a random drop from end boss
[4:03:06] PvtHudson093: yup its rng
[4:03:10] Vile_: Yeah, the plan is for it to be like the one from this tier.
[4:03:14] Jarlan23: thats what i heard except it has bad luck protection from the start
[4:03:25] casmet1994: @foghagymatyi what legendary?
[4:03:45] mcatx2: New center seems to be doing good
[4:03:47] foghagymatyi: @casmet1994 2 handed strength axe
[4:03:48] ArcaneSyntax: it's gonna be really fun if they put the axe on the fated vendor next season

[4:04:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mean bear
[4:04:24] strike879: not sure if confirmed but doesnt it need to drop first from fyrakk before lower difficulty get it?
[4:04:35] Jarlan23: what do you think of the transmog on the legendary axe? i was a bit disappointed by it
[4:04:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sweet!
[4:04:52] Rudric_Ice: @foghagymatyi pretty sure its a personal loot i think
[4:05:01] ArcaneSyntax: @strike879 nothing confirmed but it'll probably start dropping after the mythic kill
[4:05:37] PvtHudson093: First kill of that region unlocks it for that region
[4:05:54] actually_pierce: 100% drop chance? no shot
[4:06:07] Jarlan23: well liquid should just kill fyrakk on first day
[4:06:10] Snabido: So, root for your region chat Keepo
[4:06:15] cyberklinos: 10-6‚Ä¶ my Patriots are in shambles right now. Jeezus. Congrats to your Colts @towelliee
[4:06:16] PvtHudson093: yes
[4:06:17] kaeleirra: Yeah
[4:06:19] TheItalianStallion321: 1st kill was 100%
[4:06:23] Snappole_: how long do you think the race will last?
[4:06:29] Tex1090: First kill in each region yeah, if it follows the way it worked on Sark
[4:06:32] ArcaneSyntax: So NA is getting it first I see
[4:06:34] kaeleirra: Let's go Liquid

[4:07:17] actually_pierce: it's really good, man
[4:07:18] TheItalianStallion321: @Rudric_Ice
[4:07:20] TheItalianStallion321: @Rudric_Ice no
[4:07:23] ArcaneSyntax: couple pounds a week is healthy
[4:07:34] gfield2k: When Anthony Richardson comes back. Colts can make a better assessment of the team. Because before he got hurt. They were trending in the right way
[4:07:39] Alastree: Echo has terrible sportsmanship
[4:07:46] Rudric_Ice: @TheItalianStallion321 thats dumb wtf
[4:07:46] Jarlan23: has liquid ever won twice in a row
[4:07:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: It would be awful if Echo doesn't get a fair shot
[4:07:55] ArcaneSyntax: then method comes back
[4:07:58] JeemTeam: lol
[4:08:13] Chronine: echo will take their ball and go home
[4:08:17] TheItalianStallion321: HINT HINT WINK WINK
[4:08:18] brentosxd: Would it be good if blizzard let mythic reset the same time for eu and na on the second week?
[4:08:20] TheItalianStallion321: WINK
[4:08:21] Fawcheddar: if you pay extra the raid releases 3 days before ;)
[4:08:22] TheItalianStallion321: HINT
[4:08:29] coolent: echo should stop the crying. werent they the ones exploiting the renown thing this patch so all their raiders have atleast level 20 renown at the second day
[4:08:32] Cower311: thatd be such a sign of weakness tho cause NA has lost plenty and nvr quit
[4:08:34] Allsee_: Just do Global with Fated where it doesnt matter who wins
[4:08:37] ZeusDNA: @Jarlan23 Yeah I think they won nyalotha and then nathria
[4:08:42] papaherc: global release then i will start following the race again
[4:08:54] viivop: wonder why the release times are different in the first place
[4:08:58] aperri: @Towelliee is darkmoon faire gone?!?!
[4:09:04] knuuuunt: if you are competing and you didnt exploit your renown your stupid lets be real
[4:09:06] Honvar: @coolent Sure man
[4:09:21] knuuuunt: you have to use the tools available or you will not be competitive.
[4:09:33] knuuuunt: because other competitiors will use those tools regardless.

[4:09:36] SaraDivine: i feel like it's mostly logistical. having to deal with problems in both regions at the same time will inevitably be awful work hours for one region or both.
[4:09:40] ArcaneSyntax: im not sure global release fixes low viewership
[4:09:46] TheItalianStallion321: yes have Liquid run the table. Method did it for years
[4:09:46] strike879: then the next time after the time is changed the one that loses bitches the time was bad for them
[4:09:47] regalbeast: blizzard needs to pay popular streamers to participate
[4:09:51] ohlszon: @coolent Stop cry? imagine u have been raiding for 10y+ and the other competetives get 1 day ahead of u makes sense? no not at all this should neen changed ages ago
[4:10:05] Nerendis: Global release fixes more than people realize
[4:10:18] ohlszon: Global release fixes alot ye
[4:10:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Side by side racing is more exciting, yes
[4:10:20] jers_gaming: global release would be in the best interest for sure
[4:10:22] Snappole_: i feel like simultaneous release messed with it too since first 2-3 days are just splits now
[4:10:23] ArcaneSyntax: @coolent it's nowhere near a day headstart lmao
[4:10:24] JimmyBeardSlam: what time would you think it best for a global release?
[4:10:28] xxsargexx: @ohlszon yes that totally explains why EU has more WF's overall LUL
[4:10:32] hunthutchy: HUH
[4:10:33] TheItalianStallion321: a global release would blow everyone's minds and make it a real face
[4:10:37] TheItalianStallion321: race, not face
[4:10:38] JimmyBeardSlam: thinking about timezones
[4:10:40] knuuuunt: @Nerendis it short-term destroys blizzards wallet for a risky maybe gain
[4:10:46] ohlszon: @xxsargexx Still doesnt change the fact tho does it?
[4:10:46] mavericks312: why would blizz pay streamers for not there event?
[4:10:49] brentosxd: HAHA
[4:10:55] TheItalianStallion321: ill take $10k
[4:10:56] Jarlan23: get xqc in there on tank
[4:11:00] brentosxd: i would pay money to see asmon smashing his head in mythic
[4:11:00] Vile_: Blizzard paying Asmongold lmao
[4:11:03] Barreesam: I would watch that just for the humor in it
[4:11:03] strike879: asmon cant even do lfr
[4:11:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: he would spend that million on honkai star rail
[4:11:11] aperri: anyone know if darkmoon faire is done?
[4:11:15] Nerendis: 19
[4:11:16] regalbeast: that solves viewership if that's what they care about. I wasn't talking about quality lol
[4:11:17] hellbunny: ngl I like rwf cause of the pog shirts that come out
[4:11:20] kaeleirra: He would bitch and cry the entire time...
[4:11:23] bookerwashington: !drop
[4:11:24] xxsargexx: @ohlszon no but it doesnt change the fact i just said. maybe Echo should stop whining and win
[4:11:34] bookerwashington: !drops

[4:11:40] mcatx2: This was mentioned about Lively
[4:11:41] mcatx2: This is where Lively II comes into play. Whenever the rookie was on the court, the team had given up 51.1 points in the paint per 100 possessions. However, when he was off the court, Dallas allowed 59.3 opponent points in the paint per 100 possessions.
[4:11:47] knuuuunt: @Vile_ They send him free shit all the item I mean thats kinda like paying him lmao.
[4:11:53] regalbeast: then what is your suggestion for increasing viewership?
[4:12:04] mavericks312: @regalbeast that doesnt solve viewership random streamers have 0 shot of winnign
[4:12:10] ohlszon: @xxsargexx I mean why would they not point it out they have said it for ages still nothing has changed so, but if other team wins cause of reset it just bad
[4:12:15] mashiesmashie: just like F1 year on year

[4:13:01] strike879: splits can be fixed if they do limited pull again just like ICC had
[4:13:13] ArcaneSyntax: limited pulls is turbo ass for regular guilds
[4:13:15] Snappole_: i miss when day 1 of mythic being out actually meant seeing them go into mythic lol
[4:14:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Great Push is a good watch
[4:14:49] Artiriouz: i would enjoy no PTR alot more
[4:14:58] brentosxd: yea
[4:14:58] Barreesam: Yea they need to be going in blind
[4:14:59] akia03: so more screwed up bosses?
[4:15:16] regalbeast: I don't think that attracts many viewers outside of the usual fans
[4:15:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I'm for no external raid testing on PTR
[4:15:25] Rudric_Ice: datamining kills hype for future content
[4:15:26] CapTV8: that would eliminate weakauras being created during ptr.. true race to figure out day 1
[4:15:30] Skobble: @towelliee have they ever clearly stated why they can‚Äôt do global release?
[4:15:53] mavericks312: i think by 12.0 were not testing bosses  anymore
[4:16:24] zorebotswow: I wish Blizzard would do the same thing with expac as the are doing with Season of Discovery
[4:16:39] Nutsy: as someone who raids VERY casually in pugs i dont mind global release
[4:16:47] gassygatinho: Half of the liquid team is eu anyway
[4:16:55] Toojicle: !server
[4:17:09] Niksen_99: Will you still be streaming while RWF is going on? Love to hear ur takes
[4:17:15] Melonbrew: Destiny 2 can do global launch. They time it so it's AM in US and PM in the EU
[4:17:24] mcatx2: Is there a true advantages to going first?  Also, are there any cons?
[4:17:32] akia03: would you take eu timezone or us timezone?

[4:18:06] rymerre: is method still a thing lol
[4:18:12] Niksen_99: So u think Liquid would throw on purpose cus they need Echo to still be relevant KEKW
[4:18:15] Nutsy: @mcatx2 Do you know any race where a headstart is a disadvantage?
[4:18:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Method was running pretty strong in the last one
[4:18:22] kaeleirra: Yeah
[4:18:23] ArcaneSyntax: I think there's 0 chance echo quits, i think it'd kill the guild and the players would just leave and go somewhere else.
[4:18:26] brentosxd: I bet if echo threaten to quit blizzard would implement global resets within 24 hours lol
[4:18:29] TheItalianStallion321: @rymerre they finished 3rd in the world, so yeah
[4:18:40] rimenoceros: I claimed my dottie, but I don't see it in battle.net or in game- do I need to wait a little before it shows up?
[4:18:59] mavericks312: id say 2 3rds of taht team would just go back to method

[4:19:27] mcatx2: @Nutsy Depends on the format.  Liquid won with less pulls so it seems the "going first" part isn't all that
[4:19:38] gassygatinho: Liquid is a better team for the first 7 days after that I'd give echo the advantage
[4:19:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: @rimenoceros Drops can take a day or so to show up in game. It should be a little package in your collections that you open

[4:21:05] Anexros: problem for Liquid is that when they win it's all about the headstart, it's never about them winning no matter how hard Max tries to change the narrative.

[4:23:50] MackPlays: Alienware got Dell money
[4:23:52] Vile_: You're the reason I got an Origin PC, so YEP
[4:23:54] Vile_: EZ
[4:23:56] actually_pierce: ngl they're all very expensive haha you'll spend way way less money just getting the parts yourself
[4:23:57] itjustfeelsright: all way over priced for places outside of the United States
[4:23:58] mavericks312: shak is gonna be eatin on his DH this tier
[4:23:59] Nokterian: gonna boost a new DH when i have War Within
[4:24:05] Fawcheddar: used my preorder boost for blood DK
[4:24:09] Anexros: Alienware is very overrated lol
[4:24:10] inj0shwetrust: To the Maw with you
[4:24:10] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  Ohh,  100%.   Origin --> Starforge.   for the moment.  :D  We¬¥ll see how well Starforge will do in few more years.
[4:24:28] Noshpan: Alienware is nothing more than overpriced Dell
[4:24:28] gassygatinho: Hopefully echo catches up at tindral this time and not at end boss while other team is already at 60%
[4:24:30] janyoo: janyoo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[4:24:36] Anexros: you pay for the brand with Alienware not the specs
[4:24:37] ArcaneSyntax: it's not even that much more to buy prebuilt
[4:24:37] actually_pierce: not here in my country, building your own is way cheaper
[4:24:38] xxsargexx: go into the maw after death then come back out looking like anduin after years of maw dailies
[4:24:38] th3janitor: that should be soda punishment.. you die you have to play the whole shadlowlands campaign 1-60
[4:24:40] theDirtyon3: @mavericks312 Avade is playing DH wouldnt be surprised to see shak on something else but two DH is a probability
[4:24:50] kirbbles: It's like buying a car. If you go new you get exactly what you want
[4:24:51] Harmar: at most its just the labor that is the decider in price
[4:24:52] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  cheaper to fix the computer yrself when a p[art goers bad just like fixing yr car
[4:24:55] ribose1982: I just buy alien ware every few years as adverts always pop up for them
[4:24:57] Nokterian: for me it was my job building pc's for people but in the end its still a hobby i prefer making my own pc
[4:24:58] Niksen_99: I dont mind paying extra for the PC to be ready to plug in when i buy it lol
[4:25:02] itjustfeelsright: i looked to get a pre built and the prices to have it shipped just kills it even
[4:25:05] smashwow: Last time I priced it build vs buy is almost not even a talking point. It‚Äôs kinda wild
[4:25:06] MackPlays: You get your first one prebuilt then upgrade yourself EZ
[4:25:09] mavericks312: @theDirtyon3 oh is avade back this tier didnt know that
[4:25:16] Anexros: UK it's cheaper to buy an off the shelf pc over building one yourself due to insane gpu prices
[4:25:20] theDirtyon3: @mavericks312 yeah HUUUUUGE W to get him back
[4:25:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: System builders can get parts cheaper, it does offset cost to a degree
[4:25:31] knusing: !drips
[4:25:36] knusing: !drops
[4:25:36] Moobot: @knusing towLoot Watch at LEAST 4 HOURS starting 10:00AM PST to get Dottie the Baby Alpaca pet! Next Tuesday 11/14 10:00am PST for the White Riding Camel! towLoot Also toss a Prime Sub to the channel to support our DROPS/BAG STREAMS! https://www.twitch.tv/subs/towelliee towLoot
[4:25:38] Noshpan: Now I just call Alienware "Dell-ienware" because that's all they are now.
[4:25:39] cypher1986: i live in uk and it cost me ¬£250 more for them to build rather than myseft. well worth it
[4:25:39] tiyanigean: @MackPlays this is the way
[4:25:49] Ludicruz: @Noshpan  Last time I checked out Alienware for myself. You can¬¥t really modify anything with the cases without it not wanting to perform properly. Few years ago,  theyr customer support was horrendous.
[4:25:49] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:26:05] Trestle: Anduin looks like Steven Amell now that arrow is done
[4:26:06] theDirtyon3: Is Avade the only person to ever come in for just one boss that wasnt even in the guild really for RWF? @Towelliee
[4:26:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: i love paying someone else to build shit
[4:26:34] Harmar: i just dont like dealing with the headaches of building my own anymore, lost count how many times in the last few years with new software and bio's ive messed up because of something dumb hidden somewhere
[4:26:42] Noshpan: @Ludicruz My last PC was the bottom tier Alienware from Dell. It had subpar parts.
[4:27:20] Anexros: @Towelliee did you know your Origin link is blocked by UBlock extension?
[4:27:20] akia03: does origin have a eu place they sell from to eu?
[4:27:32] MadsGlargaard: And people don't want to learn how to build there own pc it is just more easy to buy a prebuild
[4:27:45] actually_pierce: When I buy a prebuilt from Origin for example, if something goes wrong i have to ship it across the atlantic. If I buy parts at my local store, if a part goes bad I just walk to the store
[4:27:47] Skobble: Is Origin only NA or also EU?
[4:27:52] DirtyBeef2134: !origin
[4:27:53] Moobot: @DirtyBeef2134 Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate! Use this link to build your PC‚û°Ô∏è https://tinyurl.com/2t9hymb2

[4:28:00] Nokterian: prices of a 4090 has been going up like crazy as of late
[4:28:17] theDirtyon3: powerGPU is a great company too tbh
[4:28:34] VenutianSpring: i got a nuts deal on an ibuypower earlier this year that saved like 500
[4:28:46] Ludicruz: @Noshpan  oof.   imho,  way overpriced product. last time I did watch quite a few reviewers I¬¥ve watched laughed at the product,  but that was like 2-3years ago.
[4:28:59] Gingerprimer: Getting a prebuilt is just nice because if I have time of work I can just pick it up at the post office an plug it in easy
[4:29:00] cptrogers123: Sad you have to pay a lot in customs when ordering from Origins cuz i'm from EU :(
[4:29:01] BlinkHeals: @Towelliee you going to be raiding mythic this teir ?
[4:29:17] gidgeet: Speaking of SSD drives, external or internal which is better for PC?
[4:29:26] Niksen_99: Damn so we can just spam click the link and u get paid ?
[4:29:30] Ludicruz: Meh, badly reviewed/modified respond there.  :D
[4:29:31] castlecastles: how many hall of fames do you have?
[4:29:39] Keyastaron_: @BlinkHeals followed since 2015 still doent know he M raids ? Kappa
[4:29:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: no going back to ssd after having a m.2
[4:29:55] Aidler: Origin shipes to EU if you can pay for it
[4:30:07] gidgeet: my first time buying one lol
[4:30:10] BlinkHeals: @Keyastaron_ follows since 2015 watched him almost every teir. Was just asking to make sure
[4:30:11] actually_pierce: m.2 are great, have you seen that GPUs might start having M.2 slots? cause they don't use all the channels so there are some left for an M.2, or even two
[4:30:16] Demonsaeri: Considering buying a WoW sub today, are more people playing Wrath classic ?

[4:30:46] cptrogers123: Why do you have to pay so much in customs when ordering from a US company  @Towelliee
[4:30:49] cptrogers123: im from Eu
[4:30:51] theDirtyon3: WHAT?!?!?!
[4:30:53] theDirtyon3: LUL
[4:30:58] Nokterian: there even going further for the new cards instead having to plug in power it is on the motherboard instead
[4:31:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: my work got 3 used computers and i was told to check them out and pick one for myself to use. only one of them had a m.2 so my choice was easy LUL
[4:31:02] Niksen_99: Is it your first time? @Demonsaeri
[4:31:07] theDirtyon3: that PC is like 15 years old then LMAO

[4:31:30] Demonsaeri: @Niksen_99 I've played WoW on and off since release. I never get too far really.
[4:31:33] Artiriouz: wotlk is just full of gdkp groups its trash imo
[4:31:37] tiyanigean: I have both. the HDD just exists so I can put all my stuuf for Uni (PDFs n stuff) on it. no use wasting space on my SSD fo rthat
[4:31:38] BlinkHeals: @MackPlays luckily where i live thats min wage

[4:51:37] MackPlays: ESOxWoW
[4:51:43] Aidler: the last Titan is Sargeras?
[4:51:51] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  Microsoft is considered to be the Company graveyard these days.
[4:51:54] Shuttlelol: hope they dont fumble it
[4:52:00] theDirtyon3: King is probably the best of the bunch too KEKW
[4:52:04] CrunkyBrewster: The Last Titan will be Molag Bal

[4:53:09] CrunkyBrewster: yeah there was a rumor going around a while back about MS wanting to buy Nintendo
[4:53:10] XLcoj: I think xalatath watches us enought to see that we are her real threat , and not do something stupid like use all her power to kill some punny titants xD
[4:53:23] CrunkyBrewster: but Nintendo was like "LUL NAH"
[4:53:26] Harmar: im especting something dumb or random where we get an impossible boss that wipes progress in some way and we repeat
[4:53:31] 3663Sharad: towTinfoil towTinfoil
[4:53:33] ThorH13: Anduin is the last Titan

[4:54:00] MackPlays: WE are the last titan
[4:54:07] Zerodur1: Wasn't sarg trying to get Azeroth to fight the void?
[4:54:08] mavericks312: my question is what role does the aspects play going forward
[4:54:09] motorboatingpro: think Sargeras will be a jerk, or become Bro-geras?
[4:54:14] Zerodur1: Any chance he's actually on our side?
[4:54:15] MackPlays: We become titans
[4:54:16] Merex760: My character is The Last Titan :)

[4:54:40] snake_like: :tf: the corruption on ebyssian finally takes hold when he attains aspect powers
[4:54:55] mavericks312: i mean shit sylvanas can bur whole races an not have the titans get involved
[4:54:59] Rudric_Ice: lmao imagine if microsoft had nintendo Mario X WoW or mario kart racing in wow LUL
[4:55:21] Harmar: @Rudric_Ice LUL
[4:55:23] strike879: we are ants to the titans do you care about ants?
[4:55:35] Demonsaeri: The titans are best people?
[4:55:38] geokouts: They will try to do a World Reset and we will have to stop them eventually
[4:55:51] asthelegendgoes: our problems aren't th eir problem unless it threatens the overall plan
[4:55:51] Snappole_: we changed algalon's thinking during that too didn't we?
[4:55:56] XLcoj: This is primnalist propaganda
[4:55:57] Nerendis: TBF night elves don't worship them though
[4:55:58] Harmar: PepeHands the tree
[4:56:04] Nerendis: They help their worshipers

[4:56:26] Rephlect: Good morning all
[4:56:37] Tirfing_: Algalon mentioned he exterminated a lot of civilizations, so not like he's normally a forgiving guy
[4:56:50] Rudric_Ice: well whatever happens i hope we get wow 2 after the saga and a FULL RESET
[4:57:03] Nevindaz: yup
[4:57:11] mavericks312: also that eonar book in the emerald dream inn shows the titans true nature
[4:57:15] Snappole_: i like to think shadowlands was just fan fiction lol
[4:57:16] Snabido: Neverending hierachy Sadge
[4:57:16] MackPlays: The first first ones
[4:57:18] Atokiri: shadowlands its a headache
[4:57:19] Fawcheddar: leave that to shadowlands
[4:57:19] theDirtyon3: SL is the new WoD
[4:57:20] Nevindaz: shadowlands should've happen after this saga
[4:57:21] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[4:57:21] Merex760: Yeah I really wish that expansion didn't happen
[4:57:26] Molvonos: towCopium
[4:57:36] rymerre: First Ones Premium Edition+
[4:57:43] 3663Sharad: Kinda yeah, but First Ones could just be a different "word" for the same thing we would call different
[4:57:45] OlDirtyCheese: Shadow lands was a fever dream
[4:57:52] Rephlect: makes sense @Towelliee
[4:57:58] Harmar: full on space WoW when Kappa
[4:58:00] alfruenna: I'm ready for World of Starcraft
[4:58:03] valianya: They gave too much powerful weapons to the Alliance over Legion and BfA to make an equal faction war believable.  Vindicaar, Jaina's magic flying ship, strategic strike void portals, etc.  Horde didn't get enough to counteract, and what they did get they didn't deploy, Dinosaurs, blood anima mechs, Nighthold temporal magic and arcane prowess, but instead deploy fireball catapults and plague that kills both sides
[4:58:04] OviTheGray: the curse of flesh corrupted most titan made races so why would they thrust us? i wouldnt walrusSip
[4:58:06] mavericks312: if they tried that shit id quit
[4:58:06] allisonkielle: Wolrd of Starcraft
[4:58:09] Snappole_: do you think they'd do a massive time jump after? like new characters too
[4:58:14] fatidicus: StarCraft wow clone
[4:58:15] Rephlect: that would be good, fresh and clean
[4:58:16] Demonsaeri: Would be epic for us to be on a new planet. New species, new classes. Maybe in 2040
[4:58:17] Layinthawood: might as well make a whole new game
[4:58:17] Nevindaz: N'zoth patch should've been and exp instead of shadowlands
[4:58:18] infinityarty: New shit everywhere.... meanwhile plays classic
[4:58:25] Rudric_Ice: sure but nothing carries over no MOUNTS no Achives and shit like that
[4:58:30] Rephlect: I agree

[4:58:33] vaironixx: imagine azeroth explodes, we are sent into space, and meat starcraft heroes to adventure with
[4:58:34] Merex760: The best thing they could do is making a WoW 2, but I doubt that'll ever happen
[4:58:36] Galadeon: Give me Universe of StarCraft!
[4:58:44] ep3wpsi2: i thought pallys were not allowed in onlyfangs
[4:58:50] Karn1987: wow 2 its just revamped wow
[4:58:50] Jarless: everything carries over
[4:58:51] Rephlect: make it new feel to get the excitement and feel of discovery
[4:58:54] mavericks312: @Rudric_Ice bro do y ou know how stupid that sounds
[4:58:55] Harmar: gnomes will go to space, im calling it now LUL
[4:58:56] Alisera: would neverrr happen
[4:58:58] Rephlect: LOL - no that would crazy
[4:58:58] Spades13: how about a THIRD FACTION?! remember the mmo Secret World?  like that!
[4:59:00] rymerre: that would be the death of the game
[4:59:00] Molvonos: Troll take, as per usual, or some really fucked up hot take.
[4:59:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: People would riot if they lost their mounts, yes
[4:59:02] Molvonos: Either way.
[4:59:03] Nevindaz: classic andies KEKW
[4:59:04] Snabido: Remember all those shop mounts ya bought? Yeah, dont exist anymore KKona
[4:59:05] Jarless: or fires in the streets
[4:59:05] OviTheGray: if nothing moves over no one will play it
[4:59:07] Demonsaeri: Let's start a riot...a riot...
[4:59:08] Shuttlelol: they have classic if they want to reset shit like that
[4:59:10] cptrogers123: It would be crazy if they made completely fresh servers for the new world @Towelliee
[4:59:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah blizz take all my store mounts back and give me nothing
[4:59:14] honeybadger1113: even if they made a second wow they would literally have to bring everything to that new game
[4:59:16] snake_like: brother that's like dropping someone's 401k into the abyss these days. hell nah
[4:59:22] mavericks312: if nothing moved over the game would die
[4:59:25] laughinbuddha: All converted to gold
[4:59:29] N3llee: could you imagine all the money people spent in the shop wasted?
[4:59:29] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!

[4:59:31] Zerpy: @Towelliee would you say blue berry muffins are S Tier?
[4:59:34] Broomba: The wow killer would be doing just that
[4:59:47] N3llee: It sounded like Metzen was looking at bringing things to an end
[4:59:52] Shuttlelol: thats kinda concerning tbh, hopefully it works out lol
[4:59:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people have spent literal years farming a single mount
[4:59:57] N3llee: When he joke about your grand kids still playing
[5:00:00] Rudric_Ice: let the riots happen towSip
[5:00:06] rimenoceros: rimenoceros subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[5:00:10] Starlight_Veil: yeah it does sound like you want Blizzard to take SE route and "end the world" to reset it, but also like you said there's no way they'd get away with that
[5:00:10] Jarless: blue berry muffin tops are goat
[5:00:16] Demonsaeri: @wEiRdO_dUdE Curious, what kind of mounts would require that?
[5:00:16] valianya: Metzen specifically said in the Last Titan the Titans return to Azeroth, so they won't die during War Within
[5:00:17] ThorH13: whats your stance on blue waddles?
[5:00:18] Zerpy: Costco blue berry muffins
[5:00:19] fatidicus: Costco muffins
[5:00:20] Starlight_Veil: well I mean by taking everything away
[5:00:25] Zerpy: lmao @Healure
[5:00:29] ThorH13: Waffles
[5:00:34] cptrogers123: Imagine they made completely fresh servers for the new world @Towelliee
[5:00:39] Atokiri: maybe the 3 expansion  annoucement was to tackle Ghost and the Riot's mmo?
[5:00:41] Aidler: @towelliee don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs possible that after the worldsoul saga it‚Äôs a wrap
[5:00:43] Broomba: blue berry muffins with butter in middle
[5:00:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Demonsaeri Baron Rivendare's mount, incredibly low drop change
[5:00:55] Spades13: what if this was "early access" all along LUL
[5:00:56] thundersquid1782: when does cata classic come out

[5:03:00] ArcaneMaki: Well it depends how the transaction with Microsoft went and how stocks were handled.
[5:03:04] Aidler: but then I will actually at some point need my grandchildren to steer my mouse and keyboard‚Ä¶. lol
[5:03:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Metzen is going to rock our world

[5:05:15] MackPlays: Even putting old games on gamepass as an intro to blizzard
[5:05:25] vaironixx: @Harmar stay strong brother
[5:06:06] mile00123: retention is good but no new players, only the regulars
[5:06:11] Mepti: so true

[5:07:08] Squats3: @Towelliee did you see the pleb line?
[5:07:25] Squats3: people that didnt pay $800
[5:07:26] Merex760: I don't like how they crammed all the panels into the arena. Just seems awful compared to how it was before
[5:07:28] itjustfeelsright: cohh is playing wow hardcore and he stayed up pretty late last night
[5:07:31] Squats3: the line was over a mile long
[5:07:32] itjustfeelsright: so he must be getting hooked
[5:07:52] valianya: And the fact they pivoted away from the philosophy that you have to trap players into playing only WoW all the time , its ok to play other games and not compete for every hour of gamers' free time to play.
[5:08:07] theDirtyon3: Cohh plays alot of old school MMO's
[5:08:12] Brodih_: Cohh played Everquests for years, so hes carefull
[5:08:12] Toojicle: No he is refusing handouts
[5:08:14] mavericks312: wasnt coh playing his drinking stream HC character last night
[5:08:16] Snabido: natty
[5:08:23] itjustfeelsright: i think hes level 13
[5:08:24] Rudric_Ice: never bought an epic edition always bought the base one this was first time i bought it lol
[5:08:29] Merex760: Well, Cohh played a lot of Everquest. Which is way harder of a game to level in than WoW. Prob just figuring it out quick
[5:08:32] Broomba: cohh is one of those players who knows how to play old school mmo
[5:08:37] Jarless: its fantastic
[5:08:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: 5 versions is awesome

[5:09:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: not worldwide
[5:09:24] I_Am_Matty: @actually_pierce What kind of hot take is that LOOOL
[5:09:24] strike879: would prob even better if you could use bnet ballance for rumble
[5:09:35] G0atBeard: im really considering hopping back into WoW for Cata. It was the first time I played.
[5:09:38] rimenoceros: thought you said WildStar

[5:10:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP Wildstar
[5:10:13] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  Ohh god.  I would love to play Wildstar again
[5:10:18] Noshpan: @Towelliee It sometimes does sound like you're saying Wildstar
[5:10:18] vellonn42: lmao yeah sounds like wildstar
[5:10:19] Harmar: the speed your saying it kinda sounds like it
[5:10:21] nizzie44: i heard wildstar
[5:10:22] YoHizen: 37k
[5:10:35] Squats3: I just want to hear wildstar
[5:10:52] actually_pierce: sure guys play LA and FFXIV and try to Copium take that FFXIV is more fun than LA
[5:10:58] cptrogers123: you are forgetting the korean lost ark players @Towelliee
[5:11:04] D4rkArsenal: not ran by ncsoft
[5:11:07] Squats3: It would have been such a good game if it wasnt funded by ncsoft
[5:11:14] Mepti: I loved that game Wildstar
[5:11:14] YoHizen: @cptrogers123 he mentioned them
[5:11:21] Squats3: they fucked that game so hard. we kept telling them in beta that the game ran like shit and the attunement was dumb
[5:11:24] Mepti: Firefly of games
[5:11:24] Squats3: but they didnt listen
[5:11:24] snake_like: the art style would definitely sell in 2023
[5:11:25] ArcaneMaki: Evoker is basically Wildstar fight system
[5:11:27] Shuttlelol: not sure about the 40 man raids for WS but great game otherwise
[5:11:29] allisonkielle: wildstar private servers?
[5:11:30] OviTheGray: same look just more polygons
[5:11:44] leonstl: there's a new PTR for Classic era that runs on 1.15 and has some SoD stuff in it
[5:11:45] Squats3: @allisonkielle they havent been able to fully remake the game yet.
[5:11:48] Jarless: you'd stream starwars
[5:11:52] Starlight_Veil: I never got to play Wildstar, but I heard their housing system was crazy good
[5:11:54] ArcaneMaki: two different games lol wut
[5:12:02] actually_pierce: LA gameplay is way more smooth and fun imo
[5:12:06] becoolbehpppy: 165k are playing baulder's Gate 3 right now lol
[5:12:17] Harmar: its good for the story but thats about it
[5:12:26] Squats3: Gearing in FF is very uninteresting. i come back for the story and thats about it
[5:12:26] ArcaneSyntax: because after you've beaten the content in FFXIV, there's nothing to do
[5:12:32] cynthenes: @Towelliee Do you have any worries that Microsoft might want Blizzard to push out expansions faster leading us to something like yearly expansions? Yearly expansions for wow just doesn't seem like a good concept to me.

[5:12:57] actually_pierce: BA3 is game of the year BY FAR, no other this year comes near
[5:12:58] theDirtyon3: Yeah BG is insane
[5:13:00] Nerendis: There was a new zelda game?
[5:13:02] ButterY0urBread: botw2.0?
[5:13:03] mavericks312: zelda reached a bigger playerbase alone
[5:13:12] legendarybarry: mounts, pets, toys, achievs, pvp, pet stuff, mythic+ is not done in 3 weeks :D only raiding
[5:13:15] Atokiri: i just know that the furry community loved wildstar but back then they were fewer than today
[5:13:21] actually_pierce: the only game that i feel is as good as BG3 that came out recently is Elden Ring
[5:13:33] OviTheGray: microsoft is gonna let blizz do what blizz does best
[5:13:34] Brodih_: bigger playerbase does not mean quality
[5:13:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: they gonna letem cook
[5:13:43] Mepti: Microsoft has been hands off on all games they have purchased.
[5:13:51] ArcaneMaki: Yeah Zelda playerbase was massive + a technical marvel to even run on the switch, still a contender for goty.
[5:13:56] Squats3: microsoft is known for not pushing their studios to do anything.. see lionhead.. they havent made a new game in like 10 years or longer
[5:14:04] TirrinWoW: sounds good to me
[5:14:09] MackPlays: WoW patches will start coming through Windows Update KEKW

[5:15:20] mavericks312: @Brodih_ if zelda wins goty dont be suprised is all ill say
[5:15:33] cptrogers123: Just wanna play wow all day lol
[5:15:45] Rekrasaur: I was hoping for a late summer release
[5:15:47] becoolbehpppy: how much mythic experiance do you need to get into a cutting edge guild?
[5:15:50] OviTheGray: @Rekrasaur they said 10.2 is not the last
[5:16:02] Mepti: They didn't break minecraft or ESO.
[5:16:11] Renoober: Fall is September 22
[5:16:15] Revlin_: MS would only step in if the f up bad
[5:16:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I can't remember hearing anything about Microsoft telling ESO to do anything
[5:16:16] jskillz777: at blizcon they said fall

[5:16:25] jskillz777: id say its sept
[5:16:31] gfield2k: long as those commons are good Microsoft not touching nothing
[5:16:41] gfield2k: comma's ^^^
[5:17:01] valianya: There were a lot of really good games this year.  But BG3 revolutionized the industry standards by bringing mainstream attention to a smaller genre of game, and massively raised the bar on player expectations for what's good, proving to companies that quality translates to more money.
[5:17:33] darkrowse21: i hear they are makin a god of war RPG
[5:17:38] Renoober: Make sense first week of September till end of September that‚Äôs 2 weeks of pre patch more than enough timee
[5:17:57] Gezber: Game pass would be nice... FeelsBadMan
[5:18:09] Shuttlelol: biggest thing microsoft could do is boost blizzard salaries and attract talent
[5:18:17] Shuttlelol: imo anyway
[5:18:36] theDirtyon3: oh yeah
[5:18:50] theDirtyon3: they might get old people back
[5:18:57] theDirtyon3: happens all the time

[5:21:43] D4rkArsenal: @DarnMoose yep all 10 of them
[5:21:54] MackPlays: Next Blizzcon will focus more on another game
[5:22:06] valianya: Survival games are like Subnautica, Green Hell, Ark
[5:22:07] Starlight_Veil: they kinda made it sound like they didn't sell as many tickets as they wanted to
[5:22:16] Nehcrom: Seems more like M$ is giving blizzard more room to breathe.
[5:22:20] Starlight_Veil: but I wasn't there it may have been packed still
[5:22:27] valianya: Valheim is a survival game too
[5:22:31] becoolbehpppy: What could retail WoW do that would be good for the game but also catch you off guard. As far as doing something different
[5:22:31] Shuttlelol: they should do a week long con and change the theme every 2 days to match their game
[5:22:31] herzlustafir: why keep it? the reasons to have it is fewer and the games are getting less

[5:24:40] Exxcar: Plus like the strikes going on right? So they were limited to the number of people that they could bring to the con from their side.
