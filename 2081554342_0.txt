[2:18:41] Dynamics831: ICANT
[2:19:26] Dynamics831: Hair care products like shampoos and conditioners can lead to premature greying of hair, due to the presence of chemicals which decrease your melanin content. Hair dyes containing hydrogen peroxide and bleaching agents can leave the hair white when used for prolonged periods @DesiHeat

[2:20:22] Elijahss: @Dynamics831 Make total sense to me
[2:20:30] Elijahss: makes*
[2:20:39] Dynamics831: @MedievalCaesar probably didn't use the certain shampoo long enough to affect more
[2:21:19] Dynamics831: its rough without a healer
[2:21:37] Elijahss: it works sometimes, but healers make it easier
[2:21:49] MedievalCaesar: @Dynamics831  I guess, just seems unlikely that only 1 single hair got affected that much but no others when you shampoo your whole head

[2:55:55] JC0830: Dub lyric songs are a style of music where the lyrics are spoken in a rhythmic way over a beat.  The lyrics are spoken or chanted. Dub often features deep, prominent basslines with electronic elements and sound effects.  Many dub songs draw inspiration from reggae, including themes of social justice and a laid-back vibe.  Dub music often includes remixes or versions of existing songs, emphasizing the beat and adding effects.

[7:01:34] DakuiOG: YEP
[7:01:34] Fossabot: YEP
[7:01:35] Leyanaqt: It is intriguing to me. Especially with all the changes/additions blizzard has done. Looks like a completely different game and experience.
[7:01:36] DakuiOG: You do
[7:01:37] cosmin284: NODDERS
[7:01:37] Zefior: vibee
[7:01:43] dasleezball: let me see checking it out
[7:02:04] glutenrich69: KEKVibe
[7:02:09] cosmin284: Vibe
[7:02:12] Leyanaqt: Yeah 100
[7:02:17] mandito_: KEKVibe
[7:02:21] TheBeaverQueen: thats why I dont play SOD anymore, it doesnt feel like classic, more like retail to me
[7:02:22] cosmin284: catNODDERS
[7:02:31] Leyanaqt: I feel like blizzard is testing features out to bring to retail somehow
[7:02:46] glutenrich69: hunters can melee KEKG
[7:02:51] Zefior: NOW what they could do is like osrs and backport content from retail like a whole fricking raid or zone and make it classic YEP
[7:02:56] DesiHeat: CatDriving
[7:02:56] mandito_: https://open.spotify.com/track/11BKm0j4eYoCPPpCONAVwA
[7:03:05] Zefior: but that would require effort
[7:03:07] Leyanaqt: Looks like a private server
[7:03:36] dasleezball: ya def just watch because you're hot xD
[7:03:41] dasleezball: funny clip tho
[7:03:44] Jake96: Yoooooo Yo
[7:03:45] Renfuryy: DIESOFCRINGE
[7:03:54] glutenrich69: yea but not top dps xd
[7:03:55] cosmin284: @Jake96 Yo
[7:04:00] Leyanaqt: Yes hunters can play survival...
[7:04:04] Jake96: good to see you again
[7:04:24] Jake96: @cosmin284 catKISS
[7:04:26] Arriv003: @Leyanaqt they aren't testing SHIT on sod. They still left in many things of old wow that pissed people off. Very few improvements.
[7:04:35] cosmin284: @Jake96  catKISS
[7:04:36] Zefior: yeah its pretty much an official private server but i think its fun for the most part kermitNODDERS
[7:04:50] Zefior: like it has potential for a true classic+
[7:04:54] Renfuryy: from what I remember melee hunter in retail was shit
[7:05:00] cosmin284: NODDERS
[7:05:00] Elijahss: It does just fine from what I have seen.
[7:05:02] Renfuryy: MM is always bis
[7:05:03] krimsin360: i would not play melee hunter in pvp

[7:05:26] Arriv003: Let's face it. There are lots of people who do not like retail wow. Having classic and SoD servers allows them to still retain those players.
[7:05:35] dasleezball: melee hunters looks very one buttonish and boring
[7:05:35] Zefior: @Renfuryy Skill issue FUNgineer jk idk ICANT
[7:05:45] cosmin284: <3 fuegoL fuegoH fuegoLove
[7:05:46] Renfuryy: @Zefior maybe, I dont play hunter xff

[7:05:53] dasleezball: yes SoD
[7:05:57] hauserdot: Desiree I am thoroughly swooned by you

[7:06:05] mandito_: AlienPls2 fuegoRave
[7:06:27] Leyanaqt: wow these que's are fast
[7:06:29] suphomiesx: im digging the sod hunter
[7:06:35] shadotdow: Fog0 PogO
[7:06:35] Jake96: im great thanks, hoping youre well
[7:06:44] Leyanaqt: How does the balance feel in SOD?
[7:07:09] DesiHeat: fuegoBobby
[7:07:11] Leyanaqt: Oh my god. No way. I missed phase 1 WSG...my favorite BG
[7:07:13] Arriv003: @Leyanaqt it's terrible. Shadow priests are pretty damn OP and shaman are kind of as well
[7:07:24] Zefior: @Leyanaqt What balance? KEKL
[7:07:38] cosmin284: catNODDERS
[7:07:42] Arriv003: But on the positives, ZERO resiliance LUL
[7:08:11] Arriv003: nope
[7:08:19] Elijahss: tbc
[7:08:19] glutenrich69: tbc
[7:08:20] Arriv003: think tbc
[7:08:20] nezzin3: tbc i think
[7:08:21] Leyanaqt: That was BC I think
[7:08:22] onewish_wow: tbc
[7:08:28] Zefior: everything is overpowered balance will either come at 60 or after the season when/if they make an official classic+ server
[7:08:33] nezzin3: but pvp gear is a mistake just have 1 gear type and let pvp be a minigame
[7:08:42] Arriv003: no to resiliance
[7:08:44] onewish_wow: o7
[7:08:50] Zefior: resilience is a band-aid soluton retail learned from that
[7:08:51] TheBeaverQueen: no it wouldnt make sense
[7:08:56] DesiHeat: !dual
[7:08:56] Fossabot: https://x.com/desifuego/status/1763796066460398028?s=20 !!
[7:08:59] cosmin284: NODDERS
[7:09:03] TheBeaverQueen: but hell the entirity of SOD makes no sense
[7:09:04] Zefior: dont repeat retail mistakes thats the point of classic+
[7:09:05] Leyanaqt: if they can't balance what they have now....adding more stats would just worsen the issue
[7:09:12] Zefior: dual spec is also garbo
[7:09:21] MrMcbadger: DinoDance RaveTime
[7:09:25] nezzin3: why not just make respeccing free so we dont need duel spec
[7:09:28] cosmin284: DinoDance
[7:09:43] caleb_barcelos: I gtg now, have a good night Desi fuegoHi
[7:09:45] nezzin3: restricting it behind gold is dumb cuz it limits experimentation and fun
[7:09:48] caleb_barcelos: !quack
[7:09:48] DesiHeat: caleb fuegoHi
[7:09:51] onewish_wow: if you get your dual spec, you will stop playing your alts
[7:09:59] TheBeaverQueen: all the stupid people ideas people have get you closer and closer to retail which is what we DID NOT WANT IN THE FIRST PLACE
[7:10:30] Renfuryy: dual spec is better than respec, respec is already almost free, but you cant respec during a raid, at the start of a bg, etc, and it doesnt save bars
[7:10:42] TheBeaverQueen: it already feels like retailk
[7:10:51] TheBeaverQueen: cata is stupid its not classic
[7:10:52] Leyanaqt: So Bllizzard is listening just as much from the SOD player base as they do on retail ?
[7:10:55] Leyanaqt: ISN'T
[7:10:56] brianfwdslash: hello
[7:10:57] Zefior: there's a reason why they moved away from dual spec, it doesnt work, make respec free while in town instead, it make it so you dont respec after every fight like in retail and keep your choice semi-impactufl
[7:10:59] Arriv003: dual spec just allows people to play the game without having to suffer through unfun things like finding tanks and healers
[7:11:02] Zefior: Chatting
[7:11:24] nezzin3: its insane to me how warrior buffs are still TWO MINUTES
[7:11:29] brianfwdslash: about to make a gnome should we go rogue or mage hmmm
[7:11:30] nezzin3: i tagged aggrend months ago about it xd
[7:11:35] Arriv003: Sublety Rogue? No raids for you, unless you respec. So, play for fun or play to get gear
[7:12:20] Distinctness: instead of duel spec just need free respecs
[7:12:24] Leyanaqt: There isn't an addon that could manage that?
[7:12:31] TheBeaverQueen: SOD is retail
[7:12:39] cosmin284: nope
[7:12:41] Arriv003: wrath
[7:12:42] Zefior: wrath
[7:12:43] onewish_wow: flying mount its also fun...
[7:12:45] Leyanaqt: Wrath
[7:12:55] Zefior: and not LAUNCH wrath it came later
[7:13:10] Arriv003: not even CLOSE to retail
[7:13:18] bweeda: lock in desi we need to win this ab
[7:13:20] nezzin3: beaver is against classic+ in general if you talk about sod like that, but classic+ is wows future
[7:13:24] TheBeaverQueen: its a gateway to it
[7:13:24] Arriv003: Only thing similar to SoD and retail is that you can change your runes in between fights
[7:13:33] cosmin284: NODDERS
[7:13:50] shadotdow: 1
[7:13:55] Arriv003: People will NOT migrate from SoD to retail. Not happening
[7:14:02] Zefior: the thing is.... dragonflight is not in a bad place right now like at all, there's some lessons to be learned from retail or the history of retail at least
[7:14:10] Zefior: keep the good purge the bad ez
[7:14:19] onewish_wow: No
[7:14:25] cosmin284: yes
[7:14:29] nezzin3: theres no reason not to add dual spec, i mean what are the negatives? are they any?
[7:14:38] DesiHeat: Redsiren PLEASE VOTE Redsiren
[7:14:39] JoeGulag: it is uneeeded
[7:14:49] valkirydgeplay: I’m mage so I would like triple spec LUL
[7:14:54] wzzl: + because resping every raid day
[7:15:05] wzzl: is piss annoying
[7:15:09] Distinctness: rigged poll
[7:15:10] TheBeaverQueen: dual spec makes it so your spec and your class matters less
[7:15:13] onewish_wow: "you think you want, but you dont"
[7:15:21] LeeshDK: I'd love dual-spec. I'm "forced" to spriest cause my guild has too many healers. Would love to be able to pop in and out of heal/shadow between raid lockouts
[7:15:21] TheBeaverQueen: which is anti-classc
[7:15:35] cosmin284: 1 yes
[7:15:45] cosmin284: Nessie
[7:15:55] Zefior: triple spec ICANT
[7:16:17] Distinctness: they made trainers for a reason
[7:16:20] Renfuryy: no changes FUNgineer
[7:16:21] TheBeaverQueen: THIS... you think you do but you dont
[7:16:47] Arriv003: They got rid of dual spec to give you ALL specs
[7:16:52] glutenrich69: quadspec PogT
[7:16:55] TheBeaverQueen: the only changes they should do is make some specs viable, and maybe add 1 race on each side for classic + thats it
[7:16:56] Zefior: im not opposed to the idea of having multiple spec, i just think dual spec is a partial solution docShrug
[7:17:01] onewish_wow: warriros already got dual specs,  mages triplle specs, shamans dual spec, just change 1-2 runes
[7:17:07] nezzin3: im in favor of triple spec
[7:17:39] Distinctness: cheap respecs fixes the prob without changing anything
[7:17:45] nezzin3: but what about prot BibleThump
[7:17:58] valkirydgeplay: SoD is Classic +
[7:17:58] Arriv003: Dual spec, having pots and ores stack in 20's vs 5's and 10's. Soo many quality of life issues that they could do
[7:17:59] Distinctness: so u can't swap out of combat
[7:18:13] nezzin3: true pveers are dumb!
[7:18:18] TheBeaverQueen: just pay and respect ... problem solved
[7:18:24] valkirydgeplay: basically so if feature works good in retail it could be in classic +
[7:19:13] Zefior: imagine having loadouts instead for pvp, you get into a bg, you get bars for pvp, talents for pvp aaaand wait for it BALANCE FOR PVP but no ... blizzard conditioned their players to have shitty band-aid solutions instead
[7:19:15] MrMcbadger: fuegoRave
[7:19:16] nezzin3: cant have fun in a videogame
[7:19:16] Jake96: DUAL SPEC
[7:19:27] frozenpizza2209: I feel like vanilla or HC are way better than sod :P
[7:19:28] cosmin284: NODDERS
[7:19:30] LeeshDK: yeah even though the cost is low it's still prohibitive for me. Im poor XD
[7:19:39] Arriv003: Why should you have to pay every time for a quality of life feature that is proven that players like.
[7:19:41] TheBeaverQueen: respeccing is MEANT to be a gold sink
[7:19:49] valkirydgeplay: duel spec just makes stuff you already can do less tedious
[7:19:51] cosmin284: Nessie
[7:19:58] Zefior: people that are playing multiple spec and not using Talented are big trolling come on
[7:20:05] nezzin3: @TheBeaverQueen limiting experimentation and fun behind gold sink is dumb
[7:20:06] Zefior: who tf puts talent points manually in 2024
[7:20:37] Distinctness: just don't respec EZ
[7:20:41] Renfuryy: needing multiple buggy addons and to run to a trainer whenever I want to play another role is annoying xffshrug I play a class that can do multiple roles for a reason
[7:20:41] TheBeaverQueen: your spec should matters and if you can do everything than it take sthat away thats not vanilla
[7:20:46] MrMcbadger: ALOO
[7:20:51] frozenpizza2209: It just feels retail vanilla rushed with weird stuff - feels boring fast. Guess I love nostalgia
[7:21:00] Arriv003: Yea, you're taking out SOOO much gold in the game with respecs. KEKW
[7:21:19] Arriv003: You want to take gold out of the server economies?? Eliminate AOE mage farming OMEGALUL
[7:21:27] Distinctness: just pvp with raid spec do more dam
[7:21:29] LeeshDK: im leveling a 2nd priest cause I don't wanna change specs back and forth all week
[7:21:34] Zefior: for respec to be a gold sink it would need to be 200gold or something with the inflation caused by gold buyers and increased quest rewards ICANT
[7:21:44] nezzin3: meanwhile we talking about duel spec added in sod yes or no... im dreaming about actual classic+. new zones, classes, raids, dungeons etcetc BibleThump
[7:21:45] Distinctness: or vice versa
[7:21:50] onewish_wow: you jsut cant eat a cookie and have a cookie
[7:22:00] hauserdot: arms is better anyways
[7:22:07] H3NRYwitha3: Sounds like someone secretly wants to play retail
[7:22:07] hauserdot: or two handers rather
[7:22:17] Zefior: @nezzin3 THIS
[7:22:21] nezzin3: yes but its taking too long :(
[7:22:32] TheBeaverQueen: just fucking basically copy turtle
[7:22:33] nezzin3: i want it meow
[7:22:35] TheBeaverQueen: no more no less
[7:23:31] TheBeaverQueen: SOD is starting to thrift away so far from Vanilla already seriously where is the limit
[7:23:36] Zefior: maybe with "Season of Discovering we can make actual classic content" Hmmm we waited how long for them to figure that out? years, ps server have been doing it for a loooong time stop making excuses for a multi billion dollar company
[7:23:43] nezzin3: beaver thats the entire point lol, sod is classic+
[7:23:57] Elijahss: Dual spec would have been in WoW on launch in 2004 if the Devs were better at their job
[7:24:12] Renfuryy: if you want pure classic play era
[7:24:15] cosmin284: catNODDERS
[7:24:19] nezzin3: maybe we discover a dual spec rune in p3 ! Poggers
[7:24:27] TheBeaverQueen: I want to play Classic
[7:25:00] jared1991z: classic is a snore fest
[7:25:02] greta1500: yea im playing everyday
[7:25:02] TheBeaverQueen: yeah on a server that is already done over and over
[7:25:09] TheBeaverQueen: classic is a blaxst
[7:25:11] TheBeaverQueen: blast*
[7:25:31] suphomiesx: classic good idk how alive it is rn
[7:25:31] nezzin3: classic is played out and classic+ is the future
[7:25:31] greta1500: EU firemaw
[7:25:43] Zefior: "SOD is not classic" what is it then? its branded as classic, sold as classic so what the hell is it? Hmmm its certainly not classic+ its a beta/seasonal server whatever you want to call it docShrug
[7:25:58] TheBeaverQueen: I would love Classic + but SOD feels far of what Classic + should be
[7:26:04] jared1991z: wait
[7:26:08] jared1991z: didnt u die in strat live
[7:26:10] jared1991z: on hardcore
[7:26:11] Zefior: they said they weren't sure about what would happen to our characters after sod is over docShrug
[7:26:18] jared1991z: lol i remember that
[7:26:24] fuzzysucculent: !death

[7:26:57] fuzzysucculent: ohh i seen that, was a good way to go
[7:27:05] nezzin3: average warrior gameplay Kappa
[7:27:25] Zefior: im not gonna play era soooo i really hope we get a classic+ server with stuff that the community liked from sod and what people didnt like removed Hmmm
[7:27:26] glutenrich69: KEKDance

[7:28:16] Zefior: catNODDERS
[7:29:01] DesiHeat: YEP
[7:29:01] Fossabot: YEP
[7:29:08] frozenpizza2209: imo I just want a classic 2019 without gdkp and boosting + a tbc arena server
[7:29:08] cosmin284: catNODDERS

[7:31:15] phoenixfire7112: @DesiHeat Retail is hopeless
[7:31:16] Elijahss: Retail and Classic are both so much fun.
[7:31:28] dipchit1: no we want retail to fail so they redirect all their energy into giving us real classic+
[7:31:28] frozenpizza2209: @fuzzysucculent Forever young brah! But still, the world around u feels meh at 32 yo :D Work work work, baby, sleep :D Just not for me
[7:31:32] hauserdot: Vibe

[7:31:46] Distinctness: pov u wasted too many hours in both lol
[7:31:49] MrMcbadger: like saying twitch sucks kick is better
[7:31:54] phoenixfire7112: @DesiHeat Retail still sucks
[7:31:56] MrMcbadger: false
[7:32:01] Zefior: DinkDonk retail and classic are really 2 different games, its fine not liking one and preferring the other but it would be foolish to not learn from retail mistakes nope
[7:32:02] MrMcbadger: love beatS hate yo
[7:32:04] DesiHeat: apeStare

[7:32:49] nezzin3: still waiting ResidentSleeper
[7:32:59] phoenixfire7112: @DesiHeat Taylor Swift Sucks Shit too just like Retail
[7:33:05] MrMcbadger: suffering
[7:33:23] Zefior: @dipchit1 never gonna happen, you wanna know why? money, if you really want that what you are also telling blizzard is that you are willing to pay the bills, so prepare your wallet i guess
[7:33:23] MrMcbadger: Nessie
[7:33:24] hauserdot: fuegoRizz
[7:33:26] frozenpizza2209: @TheBeaverQueen We in this together! I dont stop until we get fresh vanilla
[7:33:36] phoenixfire7112: I wish there was FRESH

[7:35:44] TheBeaverQueen: Season of Messy
[7:35:46] Zefior: @fuzzysucculent doesnt change anything, you can interact with the economy docShrug
[7:35:52] Distinctness: no
[7:35:56] Zefior: @Zefior *cant
[7:36:12] TheBeaverQueen: Season of Mastery was a mess
[7:36:17] Renfuryy: ICANT
[7:36:20] Renfuryy: IMDEAD
[7:36:21] Arthident: OOOO
[7:36:24] Arthident: CAUGHT
[7:36:29] phoenixfire7112: @DesiHeat 2019 WOW classic was so HYPE
[7:36:31] Zefior: Season of Mastery was a joke, road to rag carried that season HARD, som died with hc rag
[7:36:34] phoenixfire7112: we need that again
[7:36:39] Renfuryy: @Arthident shocked
[7:36:41] MrMcbadger: IveGonePastThePointOfInsanity
[7:36:42] TheBeaverQueen: oh I agree HC was a blast and we needed one for the other to happen but still SOM was messy af
[7:36:43] frozenpizza2209: Srsly, SoD would be bis without runes. Then its just vanilla with new raids. Thats what we asked lol. f the retail players :D
[7:36:50] Arthident: @Renfuryy how are you today GIGACHAD
[7:36:51] hauserdot: fuegoVibe
[7:36:55] TheBeaverQueen: @frozenpizza2209 I can get behind that
[7:37:02] dipchit1: som was dope bc only real mf'ers played it
[7:37:02] Renfuryy: skyfury was a fresh wrath server yes
[7:37:03] fuzzysucculent: @zefior still feels like a pointless endeavor when you can just get lvl 60s to carry you, not saying that everyone would.
[7:37:18] frozenpizza2209: No world buffs
[7:37:36] Elijahss: not any real changes, so I didnt play
[7:37:38] Zefior: @fuzzysucculent havent played sf hc but if mob tagging is a thing yeah they should look into fixing that i agree
[7:37:38] frozenpizza2209: It  came out with tbc lol
[7:37:53] Distinctness: nobody wants a seasonal game that takes 5 days game time to reach max lvl
[7:37:55] Renfuryy: @Arthident im okay fuegoFaded catHug
[7:38:07] dipchit1: som was fine, it was better with only true classic fans playing
[7:38:13] TheBeaverQueen: No WB, the PVP system was fuuuuuuuuuuuucked also as much as I didnt have a problem with the raids change many did have a har d time clearing which made it sadly not available for a lot of guildies or people in general
[7:38:15] frozenpizza2209: New raids in vanilla WITHOUT anything else would be bis af for us old people
[7:38:48] dipchit1: yeah main problem was the pvp rank 14 gear available from day 1
[7:38:49] hauserdot: phase 2 in classic was epic
[7:39:10] Elijahss: I saw SoD at Blizzcon and instantly knew I was in love with the idea.
[7:39:11] frozenpizza2209: I just wish SoD was without runes. 10x better for me.
[7:39:14] TheBeaverQueen: new raids / dungeons in vanilla, maybe tweaks the classes and specs to make them a bit more viable and maybe a couple races, like high elves and goblins (like turtle wow) and then youre in business
[7:39:20] JoeGulag: true classic is good but sod is goated
[7:39:24] Zefior: how come osrs can do it but blizzard cant figure it out? they added raid, quests bunch of shit but blizzard cant? come on Stare
[7:39:27] cosmin284: @Elijahss yes
[7:39:28] TheBeaverQueen: would be classic +
[7:39:33] frozenpizza2209: yeah phase 2 classic 2019, INSANEEEEE
[7:39:47] fuzzysucculent: ye go play era then ma boi
[7:39:55] Zefior: horizontal progression instead of vertical thats the difference
[7:40:02] TheBeaverQueen: like mage healer warlock tanks rogue tanks like seriously
[7:40:06] TheBeaverQueen: thats messy
[7:40:07] cosmin284: NODDERS
[7:40:08] glutenrich69: plinkVibe

[7:40:27] Arthident: sleeping bag Bedge
[7:40:28] glutenrich69: sleepingbag fun keking
[7:40:37] TheBeaverQueen: LUL
[7:41:00] frozenpizza2209: Wotlk = tokens xD
[7:41:01] TheBeaverQueen: they stole that from turtle wow (the tents)
[7:41:01] Elijahss: The runes and the new raid is what sold me right away.  The PvP turned out way better than I expected for me though.
[7:41:05] LeeshDK: i enjoy the rune quests in sod so much. Makes you group up for a lot of them
[7:41:18] fuzzysucculent: take away mage healing but leave lock tank
[7:41:19] Zefior: ok you know what fuck it! IM GONNA SAY IT GET READY, THE SLEEPING BAG IS AS MUCH OF A MEME AS THE SELFIE CAM PATCH IN RETAIL, THERE I SAID IT ICANT
[7:41:21] frozenpizza2209: Imagine, priest gets penance lvl 2 :D already there, red flag
[7:41:22] glutenrich69: @frozenpizza2209 era is actually alive and kicking
[7:41:32] m1sscl1que: with sleeping bag i can sleep with my friends =))
[7:41:50] Renfuryy: Malding
[7:41:51] Arthident: for my part i wished for classic+  .. especially like giving speccs a chance that are underperforming and additional lvl 60 content.. idc  about leveling stuff and runes
[7:41:53] TheBeaverQueen: no takeaway locktanks AND mage healing
[7:41:58] Elijahss: @m1sscl1que Cuddles <3
[7:42:10] frozenpizza2209: @glutenrich69 I know, but 5 years old shiat. AH prices xD and everyone in t3... Very fun as new in bgs :D

[7:44:09] brolyzoldyck: payoOld
[7:44:11] Elijahss: @Zefior keking
[7:44:14] frozenpizza2209: SSF should have been new server lol
[7:44:16] MrMcbadger: fuegoRave
[7:44:17] Zefior: @Zefior you look like an homeless person sleeping in that thing you cant even use it in town ICANT
[7:44:43] Distinctness: they just need to merge the servers
[7:45:19] Arthident: i believe they were too afraid that HC SF is not attracting many players thats why they put it on normal hc server
[7:45:20] fuzzysucculent: it makes sense that it would be on another hc server tho, after hype server would of died. still they could of merg'd  if that came to it. just lazy from blizz
[7:45:38] TheBeaverQueen: I agree with him
[7:45:45] Zefior: i mean ... the sf "bubble" would have been bigger sure but it would have died pretty quickly anyway
[7:45:57] Distinctness: good take but I'd just prefer a merge
[7:46:03] Arthident: i agree with him but i do see the point why blizz put it just as option on normal hc @DesiHeat
[7:46:05] Distinctness: cuz u can take it off I think?
[7:46:10] Elijahss: Majorly based take by Staysafe
[7:46:12] frozenpizza2209: Blizzard classic devs 19 years old
[7:46:20] frozenpizza2209: Doesnt know wtf theyre doin :D
[7:46:33] Zefior: if you cant interact with the economy why does it matter having a dedicated server? fuegoThinking
[7:46:58] dipchit1: @Zefior mob tagging
[7:47:13] Arthident: yea release timing was soooo bad
[7:47:20] cosmin284: catNODDERS
[7:47:28] cosmin284: Nessie
[7:47:30] Zefior: @dipchit1 yes but what if they fix that issue what then?
[7:47:35] TheBeaverQueen: they release too much content in same time all the time and its splitting the player base and doing disfavor to the game imo
[7:47:40] frozenpizza2209: Just give me a 10K vanilla server blizz ffffsssssssssssssssss
[7:47:42] dipchit1: @Zefior well they didnt
[7:47:43] Arthident: but also .. would'Ve loved it more if it wouldve been SSF .. like they had on unofficial hc last year
[7:47:43] TheBeaverQueen: at the same time*
[7:47:55] frozenpizza2209: 10k players
[7:48:04] frozenpizza2209: HC should have been SSF from the start lol
[7:48:07] TheBeaverQueen: @frozenpizza2209 yesssssssss
[7:48:18] Arthident: @TheBeaverQueen true.. official hc killed wotlk .. and sod killed hc SadCat
[7:48:19] Renfuryy: xff
[7:48:25] shadotdow: danse
[7:48:30] Zefior: @dipchit1 i know that but we're all speculating here so what would having mob tagging disabled change?
[7:48:31] cosmin284: danse
[7:48:35] TheBeaverQueen: @Arthident fact
[7:48:50] frozenpizza2209: no trade, no ah, no mail = no fucking bots. Blizzard doesnt want that, they want mooooneyyyyy
[7:49:11] frozenpizza2209: party and dungeons are ok. But not the rest. I hate RMT
[7:49:17] dipchit1: @Zefior if they fix mob tagging that would create an easy way to grief people, by hitting their mob they get 0 exp?
[7:49:19] Forgiw: no new realms was the dead sentence for SF HC
[7:49:32] MrMcbadger: danse
[7:49:35] Arthident: yeah i get their point.... SSF was the thing that made hc special for me and also challenging at times
[7:49:36] Zefior: @Arthident i said, it ... multiple times, the classic community or blizzard i should say is leaving a graveyard of dead gamemodes behind every single new release
[7:50:15] siggysudzz: fuegoLove fuegoLove
[7:50:16] DesiHeat: danse
[7:50:19] Zefior: @dipchit1 ok and how would that change on a new server long term? sure it would make a better release but after the initial boom not really
[7:50:21] frozenpizza2209: A lot play SF rn
[7:50:35] cosmin284: <3 fuegoL fuegoH fuegoLove fuegoQueen
[7:50:41] TheBeaverQueen: SF is popping tho
[7:50:43] TheBeaverQueen: (HC)
[7:50:43] frozenpizza2209: Just merge all the HC servers
[7:50:55] glutenrich69: turn on the heater keking
[7:50:55] TheBeaverQueen: I am playing it now its popping pretty good
[7:51:01] Distinctness: @TheBeaverQueen what server for horde?
[7:51:03] siggysudzz: Morning miss
[7:51:06] Forgiw: no, I'm not going to play SF, kinda weird to play on a hyper inflated realm
[7:51:09] Arthident: @Zefior yea ... also lots of times the community is at fault.. just look at many ppl.. they are wanting so many different things and then just hop from release to release
[7:51:11] Forgiw: how is your mage?
[7:51:11] Zefior: SF is popping there's like 12 people when a wb drops wow KEKL
[7:51:15] siggysudzz: I always wake up at 4am idk why
[7:51:17] TheBeaverQueen: @Distinctness idk im playing alliance on DP
[7:51:22] dipchit1: @Zefior because a whole batch of people would have to hit 60 without getting carried, yes eventually the same problem could arise but they could do a new server then
[7:51:25] Elijahss: I feel like OnlyFangs made HC pop off on Twitch and then die once they all quit.  The RMT bots must have loved them.

[7:53:23] cosmin284: Nessie
[7:53:25] Forgiw: is there any info yet when they going to fix the lag in STV? or we just have to deal with it
[7:53:49] Arthident: i can say for myself.. after vanilla.... i never loved wow more than on unofficial hc .. that was an awesome time and a really great community there
[7:53:53] Zefior: @dipchit1 see how many different opinions there is just in this chat? imagine that, with reddit, twitter, everything trying to figure out what people want, its hard man i wouldnt want to be a wow dev right now it must sucks
[7:54:57] fetza108: Deletete stv pvp and do and stv faction battleground like arathi basin
[7:55:01] Elijahss: we should head there after this match
[7:55:09] Zefior: @Zefior thats why i would want them to do like old school runescape and make polls and shit in game that people can vote on to make the game evolve in a "classic" way

[7:58:14] glutenrich69: eots would be out of place in classic
[7:58:30] Zefior: @fetza108 what osrs is doing is the game is stuck in the 4th age or something and rs3 is in the 5th age onward that way you dont end up in a situation where you fight gods and shit or go in the shadowlands
