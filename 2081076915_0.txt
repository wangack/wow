[0:17:08] Bishox: YEP
[0:17:12] kellarXO: im doing gnomer Despairge
[0:17:31] Bishox: #NO CHANGES all the way, and then switched so hard
[0:18:13] Midiosa: he must have a vendetta against streamers
[0:19:52] Csinii: i think stock vanilla is very good and id love for a new fresh
[0:20:00] Csinii: but i also enjoy the new stuff
[0:20:25] bossarmando: you are describing basically every single semi popular streamer
[0:20:34] Bishox: yeah i personally have never been #nochanges  but i dont see nothing wrong with having that opinion
[0:20:38] LaRevelations: I would imagine its just typically capitalize on the flavor of the month behavior
[0:21:05] Ranzorx: streamers act like sod is good because they want viewers
[0:21:31] Pinchy2233: alliance xD
[0:21:34] Bishox: you obviously hate worldbuffs now xdd
[0:21:46] Csinii: imo sod is alright
[0:22:20] Dhars: This was the perfect time to say "and that's why, I'm proud to announce todays sponsor, Raid Shadowlegends"
[0:23:02] Bishox: SoD is good for what it is , a seasonal experiment, and i like the dev teams approach to it

[0:24:28] xaruspex: that was a great impression
[0:24:31] bossarmando: tbh most popular streamers weren't into vanilla and "no changes" in the same vein as you were, they just saw an avenue into streaming - which is fine tbh, it's just a game at the end of the day.
[0:24:45] Bishox: yeah looks like i did LUL i get your frustration
[0:24:54] kellarXO: I'm very annoyed by all the SOD players against "retail features"
[0:24:59] Csinii: bandwagoners
[0:25:00] kellarXO: like wtf
[0:25:42] gressil1234: changes are good but they are making SoD way too much like retail or wotlk
[0:26:00] Ranzorx: @kellarXO yeah thats dumb, its clearly a retail version of vanilla so they should just appease the retail players at this point
[0:26:03] yoooofi: gotta avoid living under a bridge
[0:26:13] Dhars: You're a real one.
[0:26:22] Drpopcorn: @gressil1234 Retail Minus
[0:26:24] AlbySmithers: you were very transparent with that drink bottle thing from before
[0:26:50] Midiosa: I gave up on SOD when one of my bis weapons is from the STV event, but I can't do the event because of how buggy layering is and how bad the lag is in STV
[0:26:51] gubbyy98: i dont think instant mail and 41 yard nameplates is much to ask for tbh
[0:27:40] kellarXO: @gubbyy98 for real
[0:28:04] Bishox: @gubbyy98 41yd range for sure, but im kind of against instant mail
[0:28:21] Csinii: i dont get 41yrd range we could get it in classic with plater now its gone
[0:28:22] Csinii: stupid
[0:28:45] gubbyy98: @Bishox i can live without mail for sure, but the nameplates are horrible for casters with dots KEKW
[0:28:50] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[0:29:12] Ranzorx: theres just no end to the changes that people want with sod now
[0:29:20] Bishox: @gubbyy98 im a mage, menagerie is a pain, especially since its the only boss with somewhat complex rotation
[0:29:41] Dhars: I remember Fission, I bought one of those.
[0:29:42] Drpopcorn: it was always changes.  blizzard was never going to put in the resources required to do all the patch progression.  and honestly people wouldn't have wanted that.  some classes were so ass in early vanilla
[0:29:56] xaruspex: I was in no changes camp without knowing the game just because I wasnt trusting blizzard's input
[0:30:02] bossarmando: wow (and especially classic) does not have enough depth as a game in order to sustain an audience imo - unless you are into speedrunning naxx, which is so niche and limited
[0:30:11] TeaBagginq: what are the main things u dont enjoy SoD?
[0:30:24] rodel_media: !sod
[0:30:24] Nightbot: Dali will not be playing Season of Discovery. He respects the creative effort that Blizzard is putting into SoD, but a heavily-changed version of Vanilla does not interest him.
[0:31:22] Csinii: its a slippery slope
[0:31:37] Ranzorx: its all about expectations
[0:31:56] Dhars: I think the new dungeon system with Heroic+ in Wotlk was a good change, thoughts?
[0:32:11] Csinii: i think most of wotlks changes have been solid
[0:32:32] Bishox: @SalvDali you remember that video where a priest mind controlls bots into a wall here ? he was inspired to do it by my post a week before
[0:32:42] Csinii: i wish there was a tbc era man
[0:32:44] Bishox: takes me back to classic
[0:32:47] Ranzorx: the wrath changes were focused on "lets bring everyone up to the current tier as fast as possible" which has continued into sod
[0:32:49] Murloc_Investigator: No wotlk era is a HUGE mistake!!!!!!!!!
[0:32:53] Dhars: @Csinii I miss the BM Hunter
[0:33:03] kukits: tbc era would be GOAT
[0:33:06] Csinii: @Dhars i miss feral powershifting

[0:34:48] TizyTV77: dont listen to csini
[0:35:00] Ranzorx: sod would make more sense if it was based on wrath, nothing about it is vanilla at this point
[0:36:30] Bishox: @SalvDali would you have liked SoD if it was just a few changes to adress mana issues of a few casters  + a few minor changes like that
[0:37:19] Ranzorx: YEP
[0:37:24] Tripped1: yeah cos you're autistic
[0:37:50] Kajahl: my biggest issue with SOD is that it's just lazy content. private servers have done similar stuff for decades, and just because blizzard has now started doing their own funservers (worse than pservers) people suddenly "love" it. why not make NEW content in classic instead of just rehashing old shit then?
[0:37:59] AlbySmithers: Honest that killed fortnite for me too. Each week they change the map or were adding some new gun or boss. Was exhausting to keep up with

[0:40:02] 11NOBLESSE: cacophony good word
[0:40:15] Ranzorx: really cool playing a warrior too and knowing you were balanced around full endgame bis and then seeing other classes get changes lol
[0:40:29] vlagori: The same people that asked for class buffs in wrath were the same people that warned everyone of the slippery slope changes cause in classic
[0:40:43] kellarXO: "now that boomkins are viable why dont ret palas get some love?"
[0:40:53] floptimustv: Wrath got out of hand really quickly. SoD is a great place for that game design. It's not everyone's cup of tea but at least they were up front about it . Unlike Wrath
[0:40:56] Kapers_: What if they only made changes based on empirical data.. ex. logs?
[0:41:00] pursuee: thank you :)
[0:41:02] Kapers_: and not reddit/forums whiners

[0:42:04] Milkasserton: I would be worried if they WERE NOT making decisions based on data
[0:42:09] Bishox: how do you get DMF on era now ? is it still petri+ BG queue, or just hope you get lucky
[0:42:09] Ranzorx: blizz caving to the 10 man raid enjoyers was the end of sod for me
[0:43:31] kooolzin: i have a friend like that and his justification is that if you want to play vanilla as it was, you can just log on era
[0:43:39] LaRevelations: @Bishox You can chronoboon everything else and die right in front of the npc. Before res'ing log off and when the timer is down to like 3 seconds revive and click npc with the world buff addon that auto gets it. From there just unstuck your character on the blizz site.

[0:44:08] bossarmando: i was surprised we didn't see a bigger private server presence in classic wrath. i half expected private scene guilds showing up  and play for WF
[0:44:10] cloudbells: mop was amazing
[0:44:32] bakedbeansandbread: cloudbells then they make changes xdd
[0:44:38] Bishox: @LaRevelations dont you get killed when you take the buff then ?
[0:44:38] pursuee: @bossarmando weren't some of them in top guilds?
[0:44:56] Bishox: or can you like instantly unstuck
[0:45:04] Midiosa: is it annoying to have to keep saying absolutely no changes, but then someone constantly comes in and is like "yeah, but what about THIS change"?
[0:45:14] LaRevelations: @Bishox No, with the timer very likely you still still log off with that like 1.5s of res. Once logged off you can unstuck character back to hearth point
[0:45:18] Ranzorx: queue for bg, die on sayge, wait for bg queue then rez and grab buff and take queue
[0:45:19] skaboom17: is there a cd on dmf on era? I cant remember

[0:46:59] brooch_fan: this macro to join BG is bis: /run TogglePVPUI() /click HonorFrameQueueButton /run TogglePVPUI() /click PVPReadyDialogEnterBattleButton
[0:47:00] craftermain: it was what people said back in the days for private servers or retail store bought

[2:12:18] LaRevelations: About 2 months ago it was like 1:15. Its gotten better to 1:3
[2:12:23] NostalgicDream: maybe worth more with cata coming
[2:13:09] pheigngaming: This might be a weird take, but I actually feel like starting from scratch in era isn't that bad.

[2:14:20] jeneraljelly: Leveling 1-60 is just always a daunting time sink
[2:14:27] Kajahl: @WarmWetTight probably, since they did Cata, meaning they have no standards nor care about what Classic Wow actually is.
[2:14:55] hazzqt: i dont think they will stop classic expansions, unless the population plummets massively
[2:15:04] hazzqt: kind of 'easy money' to just keep it going

[2:15:26] Kajahl: at some point it's just retail all over again (wotlk already is)

[2:15:51] NostalgicDream: thats the nice thing about hc my 1-20 is so fast now
[2:16:07] pheigngaming: Actually the fact that I know era isn't going anywhere, as someone with limited time makes me feel like my time isn't wasted

[3:53:48] Nightbot: is salvdali supposed to be a play on Salvador Dal√≠? nice name if so. legendary artist of our times, if only his opinion was nice. world buffs are a plague on the game. after some research i seen he was in <Onslaught> so that explains enough about him. just another warrior in classic who wishes he was ahlaundoh. see you guys in fresh

[4:03:47] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:04:28] ArazosEU: @Michaell111 not at all, takes about 8 weeks for rank 14, max 50 hrs per week
[4:04:49] ArazosEU: but thats only on 2 weeks i think
[4:04:53] ArazosEU: rest of the weeks is 42 or less
[4:05:03] Michaell111: are people still premading? or is it just AFK AV borefest?
[4:05:13] ArazosEU: horde premades a lot from what i see
[4:05:15] ArazosEU: alliance doesnt really
[4:05:27] ArazosEU: max 5 person gank squads but even those are pretty rare
[4:05:29] Michaell111: thats nice, gonna hit 60 on my horde soon
[4:05:30] R_GraM_: mostly AV during the week n w.e the bg weekend is later on
[4:05:46] R_GraM_: on NA alli premades more than horde
[4:05:57] ArazosEU: horde has it easier i think cause  the queue is shorter, only 2-3 mins.
[4:06:03] ArazosEU: alliance is usually 10-15 mins
[4:07:07] ArazosEU: 8 weeks is a while but - its still faster than raiding for gear
[4:07:16] ArazosEU: and the pvp gear is really strong
[4:07:24] ArazosEU: for warriors and hunters particularly
[4:07:27] ArazosEU: rogues are ok too
[4:07:29] R_GraM_: unless u hav a lot of good for gdkp
[4:07:33] R_GraM_: gold
[4:07:42] ArazosEU: sure but even then - its not guaranteed that the item u want drops
[4:08:03] Michaell111: i literally have 0 gold and just want to pvp LUL
[4:08:05] R_GraM_: Can get T2.5 pretty easily these days

[4:16:51] cloudbells: guess that makes sense, vast majority of gdkp attenders are only there to make gold, now they buy gold instead?
[4:17:11] brooch_fan: the goal is MOP, have to get through cata
[4:17:13] R_GraM_: the game is already made
[4:17:39] cloudbells: mop will be bigger than retail pop
[4:17:43] Michaell111: fresh vanilla would be even less effort tho :D
[4:17:43] uthoz: cata is actually good and they've touched "classic" already so they will make continue to make changes for what they think will "improve" cata
[4:18:21] Murloc_Investigator: Its not even about new subs, its about scatter brain retention.....when there is a lull in SoD people may not unsub and play cata for a few months. Look how many players were doing era, wotlk and SoD.....if wotlk was the only option its lost subs until Cata.
[4:18:30] Murloc_Investigator: Not only about new subs *
[4:18:52] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:19:40] bacconader: Id guess that the majority of the people that would play a fresh for more then a couple of months are already playing on era now
[4:19:46] bacconader: So no real player gain
[4:20:13] oilyblackmouth: escor
[4:20:35] ghostgalx: they need to release cata in order to be able to release MoP, a lot of people will sub for that
