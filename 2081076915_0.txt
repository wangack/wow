[0:16:08] Bishox: i respect it dont get me wrong
[0:17:08] Bishox: YEP
[0:17:12] kellarXO: im doing gnomer Despairge
[0:17:31] Bishox: #NO CHANGES all the way, and then switched so hard
[0:18:13] Midiosa: he must have a vendetta against streamers
[0:19:52] Csinii: i think stock vanilla is very good and id love for a new fresh
[0:20:00] Csinii: but i also enjoy the new stuff
[0:20:25] bossarmando: you are describing basically every single semi popular streamer
[0:20:34] Bishox: yeah i personally have never been #nochanges  but i dont see nothing wrong with having that opinion
[0:20:38] LaRevelations: I would imagine its just typically capitalize on the flavor of the month behavior
[0:21:05] Ranzorx: streamers act like sod is good because they want viewers
[0:21:31] Pinchy2233: alliance xD
[0:21:34] Bishox: you obviously hate worldbuffs now xdd
[0:21:46] Csinii: imo sod is alright
[0:22:20] Dhars: This was the perfect time to say "and that's why, I'm proud to announce todays sponsor, Raid Shadowlegends"
[0:23:02] Bishox: SoD is good for what it is , a seasonal experiment, and i like the dev teams approach to it
[0:23:10] Bishox: but its not vanilla

[0:24:28] xaruspex: that was a great impression
[0:24:31] bossarmando: tbh most popular streamers weren't into vanilla and "no changes" in the same vein as you were, they just saw an avenue into streaming - which is fine tbh, it's just a game at the end of the day.
[0:24:45] Bishox: yeah looks like i did LUL i get your frustration
[0:24:54] kellarXO: I'm very annoyed by all the SOD players against "retail features"
[0:24:59] Csinii: bandwagoners
[0:25:00] kellarXO: like wtf
[0:25:42] gressil1234: changes are good but they are making SoD way too much like retail or wotlk
[0:26:00] Ranzorx: @kellarXO yeah thats dumb, its clearly a retail version of vanilla so they should just appease the retail players at this point
[0:26:03] yoooofi: gotta avoid living under a bridge
[0:26:13] Dhars: You're a real one.
[0:26:22] Drpopcorn: @gressil1234 Retail Minus
[0:26:24] AlbySmithers: you were very transparent with that drink bottle thing from before
[0:26:50] Midiosa: I gave up on SOD when one of my bis weapons is from the STV event, but I can't do the event because of how buggy layering is and how bad the lag is in STV
[0:26:51] gubbyy98: i dont think instant mail and 41 yard nameplates is much to ask for tbh
[0:27:40] kellarXO: @gubbyy98 for real
[0:28:04] Bishox: @gubbyy98 41yd range for sure, but im kind of against instant mail
[0:28:21] Csinii: i dont get 41yrd range we could get it in classic with plater now its gone
[0:28:22] Csinii: stupid
[0:28:45] gubbyy98: @Bishox i can live without mail for sure, but the nameplates are horrible for casters with dots KEKW
[0:28:50] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[0:29:12] Ranzorx: theres just no end to the changes that people want with sod now
[0:29:20] Bishox: @gubbyy98 im a mage, menagerie is a pain, especially since its the only boss with somewhat complex rotation
[0:29:41] Dhars: I remember Fission, I bought one of those.
[0:29:42] Drpopcorn: it was always changes.  blizzard was never going to put in the resources required to do all the patch progression.  and honestly people wouldn't have wanted that.  some classes were so ass in early vanilla
[0:29:56] xaruspex: I was in no changes camp without knowing the game just because I wasnt trusting blizzard's input
[0:30:02] bossarmando: wow (and especially classic) does not have enough depth as a game in order to sustain an audience imo - unless you are into speedrunning naxx, which is so niche and limited
[0:30:11] TeaBagginq: what are the main things u dont enjoy SoD?
[0:30:24] rodel_media: !sod
[0:30:24] Nightbot: Dali will not be playing Season of Discovery. He respects the creative effort that Blizzard is putting into SoD, but a heavily-changed version of Vanilla does not interest him.
[0:31:22] Csinii: its a slippery slope
[0:31:37] Ranzorx: its all about expectations
[0:31:56] Dhars: I think the new dungeon system with Heroic+ in Wotlk was a good change, thoughts?
[0:32:11] Csinii: i think most of wotlks changes have been solid
[0:32:32] Bishox: @SalvDali you remember that video where a priest mind controlls bots into a wall here ? he was inspired to do it by my post a week before
[0:32:42] Csinii: i wish there was a tbc era man
[0:32:44] Bishox: takes me back to classic
[0:32:47] Ranzorx: the wrath changes were focused on "lets bring everyone up to the current tier as fast as possible" which has continued into sod
[0:32:49] Murloc_Investigator: No wotlk era is a HUGE mistake!!!!!!!!!
[0:32:53] Dhars: @Csinii I miss the BM Hunter
[0:33:03] kukits: tbc era would be GOAT
[0:33:06] Csinii: @Dhars i miss feral powershifting

[0:34:18] Midiosa: streamer, do you miss any of the animals?
[0:34:48] TizyTV77: dont listen to csini
[0:35:00] Ranzorx: sod would make more sense if it was based on wrath, nothing about it is vanilla at this point
[0:36:30] Bishox: @SalvDali would you have liked SoD if it was just a few changes to adress mana issues of a few casters  + a few minor changes like that
[0:37:19] Ranzorx: YEP
[0:37:24] Tripped1: yeah cos you're autistic
[0:37:50] Kajahl: my biggest issue with SOD is that it's just lazy content. private servers have done similar stuff for decades, and just because blizzard has now started doing their own funservers (worse than pservers) people suddenly "love" it. why not make NEW content in classic instead of just rehashing old shit then?
[0:37:59] AlbySmithers: Honest that killed fortnite for me too. Each week they change the map or were adding some new gun or boss. Was exhausting to keep up with

[0:40:02] 11NOBLESSE: cacophony good word
[0:40:15] Ranzorx: really cool playing a warrior too and knowing you were balanced around full endgame bis and then seeing other classes get changes lol
[0:40:29] vlagori: The same people that asked for class buffs in wrath were the same people that warned everyone of the slippery slope changes cause in classic
[0:40:43] kellarXO: "now that boomkins are viable why dont ret palas get some love?"
[0:40:53] floptimustv: Wrath got out of hand really quickly. SoD is a great place for that game design. It's not everyone's cup of tea but at least they were up front about it . Unlike Wrath
[0:40:56] Kapers_: What if they only made changes based on empirical data.. ex. logs?
[0:41:00] pursuee: thank you :)
[0:41:02] Kapers_: and not reddit/forums whiners
[0:41:15] Murloc_Investigator: era is really nice for waking up to the same game tomorrow that you logged out of today

[0:42:04] Milkasserton: I would be worried if they WERE NOT making decisions based on data
[0:42:09] Bishox: how do you get DMF on era now ? is it still petri+ BG queue, or just hope you get lucky
[0:42:09] Ranzorx: blizz caving to the 10 man raid enjoyers was the end of sod for me
[0:43:31] kooolzin: i have a friend like that and his justification is that if you want to play vanilla as it was, you can just log on era
[0:43:39] LaRevelations: @Bishox You can chronoboon everything else and die right in front of the npc. Before res'ing log off and when the timer is down to like 3 seconds revive and click npc with the world buff addon that auto gets it. From there just unstuck your character on the blizz site.

[0:43:44] Bishox: asmongold is the most consistent streamer since he just didnt play the game really since vanilla xdd
[0:44:08] bossarmando: i was surprised we didn't see a bigger private server presence in classic wrath. i half expected private scene guilds showing up  and play for WF
[0:44:10] cloudbells: mop was amazing
[0:44:32] bakedbeansandbread: cloudbells then they make changes xdd
[0:44:38] Bishox: @LaRevelations dont you get killed when you take the buff then ?
[0:44:38] pursuee: @bossarmando weren't some of them in top guilds?
[0:44:56] Bishox: or can you like instantly unstuck
[0:45:04] Midiosa: is it annoying to have to keep saying absolutely no changes, but then someone constantly comes in and is like "yeah, but what about THIS change"?
[0:45:14] LaRevelations: @Bishox No, with the timer very likely you still still log off with that like 1.5s of res. Once logged off you can unstuck character back to hearth point
[0:45:18] Ranzorx: queue for bg, die on sayge, wait for bg queue then rez and grab buff and take queue
[0:45:19] skaboom17: is there a cd on dmf on era? I cant remember
[0:45:32] kellarXO: i personally like the run in dead start log out timer and res at 3 seconds and talk

[0:46:59] brooch_fan: this macro to join BG is bis: /run TogglePVPUI() /click HonorFrameQueueButton /run TogglePVPUI() /click PVPReadyDialogEnterBattleButton
[0:47:00] craftermain: it was what people said back in the days for private servers or retail store bought

[0:47:04] TizyTV77: is salvadorgodx full bis?

[2:12:18] LaRevelations: About 2 months ago it was like 1:15. Its gotten better to 1:3
[2:12:23] NostalgicDream: maybe worth more with cata coming
[2:13:09] pheigngaming: This might be a weird take, but I actually feel like starting from scratch in era isn't that bad.

[2:14:27] Kajahl: @WarmWetTight probably, since they did Cata, meaning they have no standards nor care about what Classic Wow actually is.
[2:14:55] hazzqt: i dont think they will stop classic expansions, unless the population plummets massively
[2:15:04] hazzqt: kind of 'easy money' to just keep it going

[3:53:48] Nightbot: is salvdali supposed to be a play on Salvador Dalí? nice name if so. legendary artist of our times, if only his opinion was nice. world buffs are a plague on the game. after some research i seen he was in <Onslaught> so that explains enough about him. just another warrior in classic who wishes he was ahlaundoh. see you guys in fresh
[3:53:51] Drpopcorn: fight club
[3:54:07] twankedd: just curious, what is your ethnic background?

[3:56:18] fatnstrong: Druid has 1-2 really sick guides, warrior it's interesting how it's more split up amongst different sources like you said
[3:56:22] skaff_stone: I did not realize there was a calve meta
[3:56:45] Mimoooxd: asians have the best calves genetics for building muscle

[4:03:38] Michaell111: hey, how hard is ranking on era now?
[4:03:47] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:04:28] ArazosEU: @Michaell111 not at all, takes about 8 weeks for rank 14, max 50 hrs per week
[4:04:49] ArazosEU: but thats only on 2 weeks i think
[4:04:53] ArazosEU: rest of the weeks is 42 or less
[4:05:03] Michaell111: are people still premading? or is it just AFK AV borefest?
[4:05:13] ArazosEU: horde premades a lot from what i see
[4:05:15] ArazosEU: alliance doesnt really
[4:05:27] ArazosEU: max 5 person gank squads but even those are pretty rare
[4:05:29] Michaell111: thats nice, gonna hit 60 on my horde soon
[4:05:30] R_GraM_: mostly AV during the week n w.e the bg weekend is later on
[4:05:46] R_GraM_: on NA alli premades more than horde
[4:05:57] ArazosEU: horde has it easier i think cause  the queue is shorter, only 2-3 mins.
[4:06:03] ArazosEU: alliance is usually 10-15 mins
[4:07:07] ArazosEU: 8 weeks is a while but - its still faster than raiding for gear
[4:07:16] ArazosEU: and the pvp gear is really strong
[4:07:24] ArazosEU: for warriors and hunters particularly
[4:07:27] ArazosEU: rogues are ok too
[4:07:29] R_GraM_: unless u hav a lot of good for gdkp
[4:07:33] R_GraM_: gold
[4:07:42] ArazosEU: sure but even then - its not guaranteed that the item u want drops
[4:08:03] Michaell111: i literally have 0 gold and just want to pvp LUL
[4:08:05] R_GraM_: Can get T2.5 pretty easily these days
[4:08:25] ArazosEU: last AQ40 i was in, t2.5 warrior tokens each went for 10k + :D
[4:08:29] ArazosEU: Amiigdkp is wild
[4:08:32] R_GraM_: weapons always tough to get
[4:08:43] R_GraM_: good weapons that is

[4:10:46] oilyblackmouth: 52 Despairge
[4:10:57] Growzerr: !alts
[4:10:57] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.
[4:11:10] R_GraM_: av and wsg popped while I was running over :(
[4:11:11] bacconader: alli seems pretty determined to grief this dmf
[4:11:26] R_GraM_: I’m committed now
[4:11:57] R_GraM_: yeah I’m gonna try that soon if it doesn’t pop
[4:12:30] R_GraM_: this is true..
[4:13:54] Karonte88: dont play sod?
[4:14:48] Michaell111: i wish blizzard would just cancel cata and would make a fresh nochanges vanilla
[4:14:50] Karonte88: what made you decide to die on that hill? :D
[4:15:12] oilyblackmouth: thriving on that hill
[4:16:05] mikaeluzu: I mean SoD botting situation got worse even after the GDKP ban KEKW
[4:16:27] brooch_fan: checkmate redditorsa
[4:16:38] Michaell111: i know it's impossible but why does even blizz think cata will be popular?
[4:16:51] cloudbells: guess that makes sense, vast majority of gdkp attenders are only there to make gold, now they buy gold instead?
[4:17:11] brooch_fan: the goal is MOP, have to get through cata
[4:17:13] R_GraM_: the game is already made
[4:17:39] cloudbells: mop will be bigger than retail pop
[4:17:43] Michaell111: fresh vanilla would be even less effort tho :D
[4:17:43] uthoz: cata is actually good and they've touched "classic" already so they will make continue to make changes for what they think will "improve" cata
[4:18:21] Murloc_Investigator: Its not even about new subs, its about scatter brain retention.....when there is a lull in SoD people may not unsub and play cata for a few months. Look how many players were doing era, wotlk and SoD.....if wotlk was the only option its lost subs until Cata.
[4:18:30] Murloc_Investigator: Not only about new subs *
[4:18:52] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:19:40] bacconader: Id guess that the majority of the people that would play a fresh for more then a couple of months are already playing on era now
[4:19:46] bacconader: So no real player gain
[4:20:13] oilyblackmouth: escor
[4:20:35] ghostgalx: they need to release cata in order to be able to release MoP, a lot of people will sub for that
[4:21:05] Midiosa: oh good you're still here
[4:21:26] Morris_ranchett: classic wod poggers

[4:21:59] gressil1234: mop lamo, thats when retail completely died
[4:22:01] Michaell111: they should just start releasing from the start again: Vanilla -> TBC -> Wotlk
[4:22:42] Murloc_Investigator: Murloc_Investigator gifted a Tier 1 sub to catasucks! They have given 150 Gift Subs in the channel!

[4:25:02] llnikon: Skeram Lord am i right?
[4:25:09] Fireclipz: @SalvDali in your opinion is the pug side better on ally or horde?
[4:25:18] Michaell111: i regret not going for r14 back in classic, only did up to 11
[4:25:47] craftermain: @Michaell111 dont regret it, was a waste of time anyways
[4:25:47] Murloc_Investigator: no for real this time dude, just arch and im out copium
[4:26:14] oilyblackmouth: 3 times
[4:26:35] Fireclipz: i regret not playing warrior until the end of tbc
[4:26:39] Fireclipz: i listened the the crowd
[4:27:17] Kewzu: rank14 would been pretty pog first gen tho  but would only ever do that shit with a premade and brackets. but we had bracket breakerrs for like 3 months straight on gehennas so fuck that
[4:27:21] cloudbells: the premading, playing with friends is the best part
[4:27:30] gressil1234: pvp died back in classic when they removed premade AV ranking
[4:27:31] cloudbells: made 2 very close friends ranking to 14
[4:27:32] Michaell111: not even for the gear just for the achievment and nerd glory lmao

[4:29:00] Kewzu: meant playing with the gear, not prestice for rank:) i would never do that to care about the rank
[4:29:02] intake2513: getting R14 and not needing weps till Naxx was huge
[4:29:13] cloudbells: which is ironic considering how insanely much harder r14 was during classic than vanilla
[4:29:15] Kewzu: but i gave up at 10 since it was not doable to rank when having a fulltime job
[4:29:53] gressil1234: rank 13 gear was so good for tanks

[4:32:37] R_GraM_: I see the appeal for new players just getting back into era now and having no gold.
[4:32:42] oilyblackmouth: did you get girdle and DB same night?
[4:32:49] Kewzu: getting rank14 was somewhat beneficial at least in my guild. they got priod dft and such items alolng the way before naxx since they needed less items. But yea with fulltime job it was never doable andmy sanity would not hold out:)
[4:32:51] Link9286: gkicked - too casual
[4:33:06] R_GraM_: for some cba going through the guild politics trying to get the gear now for a non pumper guild that is already geared

[4:34:40] cloudbells: way better on alliance, we did 14 hours 3-4 days per week "only"
[4:34:46] Kewzu: i was happy i did rank10 after i was done but fuck me the 20h of AV with long ques as a warrior having to grind world pvp was so draining for my sanity
[4:35:01] pespora: id rather do scarab lord and atiesh 2x than go for r14
[4:35:13] Michaell111: my sever was high-med pop and barely had any breakers so it was a chill time
[4:35:18] llnikon: what about the insane people that went R14 twice!
[4:35:34] Michaell111: @llnikon Monkeynews did it like 5 times KEKW
