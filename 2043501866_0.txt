I'm more than upper middle class at 30, so 0 complaints. Yet a huge part for my success is where I was born. If I were born in Afghanistan, I'd be fked. The only thing most people have done to be able to call their country theirs is to be born there. Not much of an achievement to claim superiority over another human being.

[1:00:03] Zantetsu13: to be completely fair we all know in our hearts at this time that a Hunter Biden original is worth way more than 500k
[1:00:05] Mind_G0bl1n: Almost agree but it is also worth doing art just to get better at it for later when you can make value
[1:00:05] TheEyeVII: @CrazyTiger86 unfortunately not, but the way you type is revealing in itself, I do love room temp low IQ drones like you, it's entertaining to me
[1:00:08] madgarlicjr: artist used to be poor and just create for the love of it, it wasn't until the renaissance when artist could really make a living from making art
[1:00:09] grylz89: @sinycc ppl confused about their gender is not progressing society in any way. Progress thinking today says do that. Question what is fundamentally and necessarily true. That's moronic.

[1:01:29] WhaleBlast: it is a little different than earlier revolutions in that the speed of automation will soon succeed the speed of market innovation humans can provide @StaysafeTV That is an issue, but I think this prompting is actually a new opportunity.
[1:01:30] numblezzz: intentional obscure messages are lazy and pretentious. if the artist had no direct intent behind their art, then theres no meaning
[1:01:30] EldritchMammoth: it was real funny twitter people making fun of workers losing jobs to illegal immigrants are now crying about losing their jobs to AI
[1:01:34] madgarlicjr: @TheEyeVII no my mom drives me
[1:01:35] Vehicle_King: RIP scribes
[1:01:36] hennessy147: watch makers
[1:01:39] wisecrony: how about the whole horse industry
[1:01:40] itsbrysontv: same when cameras made their way into the mainstream
[1:01:40] wisecrony: yeah
[1:01:42] fanofthebengals: michelangelo wouldn't be known if he was born in todays world
[1:01:43] Piorum_: computer used to be a job
[1:01:44] PilsnerUrquel: AI will also take stremer job dont worry
[1:01:47] cornstar15: the tractor replaced the horse
[1:01:47] kelvystorm: isn't the whole point of art the fact that it's human expression?
[1:01:47] Probulator: @ronno777 yes its already happening in the auto industry
[1:01:49] scalzy92: wonder if ai will take over streamers haha
[1:01:50] ClinxyWow: but printing press makers jobs went way up
[1:01:52] maddie_1994: I'm still mad about losing scribes
[1:01:53] likedasany: incorrect
[1:01:53] zezella03: completely true
[1:01:57] AxelFromAustralia: it’s like farmers complaining about technological improvements and their products costing less, get a new job
[1:02:06] TheEndIsNear777: #BringScribesBack
[1:02:09] basedschizo77: MAKE SCRIBES GREAT AGAIN
[1:02:10] cornstar15: @arlaster we don't complain lol
[1:02:12] WhaleBlast: photographers and macrorealistic artists
[1:02:14] madgarlicjr: what about sandwich artist? glizzyL
[1:02:17] craboskai: its called digital KEKW
[1:02:20] noChance219: Nerdge That's not art
[1:02:21] Tubolcain: Peggers
[1:02:23] itsae__: yea they do look down upon digital artists
[1:02:24] harvenius: @scalzy92 seriously doubt it, humans like humans
[1:02:29] Vehicle_King: SCHIZO art
[1:02:29] itsbrysontv: back in my day KEKW
[1:02:32] vreemdevagabond: I think this is a hasty generalisation.
[1:02:41] WhaleBlast: photographers and realism painters KEKW
[1:02:41] AceOfFlame: KKona dey turk r jerb
[1:02:51] puntingyograndma: thats beutiful
[1:02:52] tussmack: the main problem with AI art is that it strips the humanity from art
[1:02:53] TheEyeVII: I remember when I was younger we'd all go to work with horses, bring horses back cutefeBongo cutefeBongo
[1:02:54] numblezzz: there will always be a market for human-made art, people that want that can always get it. we can simultaneously use AI as a tool to take the labor out of creating things like assets
[1:02:57] Qslank: Just the way the cookie crumbles
[1:02:57] BinksMagnus: ai livestreamers incoming
[1:02:59] cornstar15: @arlaster and someone has to feed the world ha what do you do
[1:02:59] NutterCircus: Nardists right KEKL
[1:03:00] noChance219: It is simply the nature of things.
[1:03:03] Vehicle_King: whats the context for this clip?
[1:03:06] puntingyograndma: ALOT OF MISERABLE PPL
[1:03:11] Tacohealer: holy fuck, Mike Ybarra quit
[1:03:12] ufox1: with digital music the same
[1:03:13] cafrozed: you got that crud that's going around matt? I had it for the last week super stuffed up nose, just a mild cold
[1:03:18] Mr_Moffert: sstvNPC "woow"
[1:03:25] DefaTL: common knowledge
[1:03:28] bignerdtv: "value" is subjective
[1:03:28] fanofthebengals: a lot of liberals are mad at him on twitter which is all twitter is
[1:03:28] itsbrysontv: don't let emotional people dictate the narrative, Im sick of it. asmon is BASED
[1:03:29] obstata: it aint worth shit
[1:03:31] thimpaxd: HOWEVER, I think it's gonna take a long time before AI replaces the authenticity of real "art", i.e. its gonna take time before it looks like it isnt made up @StaysafeTV
[1:03:42] imradioaktive: people are blind to what's coming and its crazy
[1:03:44] numblezzz: @itsbrysontv besides being a cuckold, yeah very based
[1:03:44] cafrozed: woops forgot to put my resub thru again
[1:03:46] AceOfFlame: Have artists not known that, only reason like statue of david exists is because the value the people see it
[1:03:49] NutterCircus: If people dont buy your art, your art sucks EleGiggle
[1:03:55] WhaleBlast: it is a little different than earlier revolutions in that the speed of automation will soon succeed the speed of market innovation humans can provide. That is an issue, but I think this prompting is actually a new opportunity.
[1:03:56] harvenius: that's capitalism, pressure towards highest profit margin at any cost. Slavery, AI etc. Consumers don't care (mostly).
[1:03:58] artilectXLII: ...if you are an artist, the trick is to identify as an AI Kappa
[1:04:01] puntingyograndma: cant wait to have irl megamn battle network on god
[1:04:02] ClinxyWow: history shows most artists didnt have any value until they died
[1:04:09] Probulator: when you create art doesnt that feed into the AI algorithm letting the AI know what art is?
[1:04:20] fanofthebengals: michelangelo would be joe schmo in todays world
[1:04:20] hersh__69: Coomer
[1:04:25] trebolz: hi
[1:04:25] ClinxyWow: @Probulator damn
[1:04:27] pottatowtv: You value the city of Stormwind yet support those that refused to pay Vancleaf for his hard work curious
[1:04:28] TheEyeVII: it's not about what he said it's about how he said it imo, he said it in a rude condescending  obnoxious way & twitter weirdos got mad
[1:04:32] Educ4ted: ITs soft people thinking that all their opinions matter @StaysafeTV
[1:04:40] Piorum_: Artists can almost always point to some small detail that is off but honestly most people can't tell the difference in really good ai art
[1:04:56] saberign: kinda like how some streamers have more viewers than others some streamers just appeal to larger fan bases
[1:05:01] Mr_Moffert: art

[1:05:30] cafrozed: if its a florida man....that's real
[1:05:32] mattbarz989: That's mooj
[1:05:35] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV whats the deal with this taylor swift ai art i keep hearing about?
[1:05:37] bignerdtv: SEND THEAT GUY DO TEXAS!

[1:06:23] numblezzz: 4/4 wrong, nice
[1:06:23] fanofthebengals: wow
[1:06:23] Zantetsu13: just face it you cant
[1:06:32] Zantetsu13: all artsists are fakers anyways
[1:06:36] HrdScp: new stream game dropped POGGERS
[1:06:39] madgarlicjr: HYPERCATJAM HYPERCLAP
[1:06:42] basedschizo77: EZ
[1:06:42] thimpaxd: @StaysafeTV Well, we still gotta consider the fact ppl want art on the walls right, and that's when you can see the real difference rn, right
[1:06:49] imradioaktive: pray for a solar flare like I do
[1:06:51] puntingyograndma: oh u dumb
[1:06:52] WhaleBlast: 2
[1:06:52] Vehicle_King: 3
[1:07:04] fanofthebengals: 1
[1:07:20] Vehicle_King: its Joever
[1:07:24] TheEyeVII: AI can't innovate tho it can only steal already made things by people but doesn't mean it's not good LUL
[1:07:25] numblezzz: mind = blown!
[1:07:26] harvenius: they should have used faces
[1:07:27] maddie_1994: Mind = blown!
[1:07:33] itsbrysontv: The sentence corrected for spelling and grammar would be: "I think people struggle to fathom the concept of 'exponential growth/progress.' the progress of AI will blow people away and catch them off guard.
[1:07:35] AceOfFlame: that old picture was obviously 1 KEKW
[1:07:35] jaynkumz: thanks actually extremely difficult to do
[1:07:37] MarcoFlee: AI detection is really spotty
[1:07:41] Probulator: @StaysafeTV AI SSTV when?
[1:07:44] maddie_1994: Easy enough
[1:07:45] cornstar15: easy
[1:07:47] fans30: none are ai lmao
[1:07:47] WhaleBlast: monkaHmm
[1:07:48] mattbarz989: Yo what procs the boon buff?
[1:07:49] jaynkumz: that's *
[1:07:49] winsseli: did you hear about artists "poisoning" images with a program called "nightshade", poisoned images in training data makes models go poop
[1:07:50] Mr_Moffert: :) just look at the fingers
[1:07:52] Wingsofjanitor: pepoG getting on it

[1:08:01] Xahvion: @chat in classic/sod is there a minimum skill  lvl to disenchant items?
[1:08:01] Harles_: 5Head
[1:08:05] WhaleBlast: put a geoguesser on the case I bet they will crack it in 10 years
[1:08:13] numblezzz: i wanna hear staysafe AI and lil P AI fight over minecraft Pog
[1:08:25] jaynkumz: @Dman2848 no it absolutely cannot
[1:08:31] Probulator: @numblezzz LUL LUL LUL
[1:08:42] puntingyograndma: Lmao that person is so sad
[1:08:43] TrueSmugg: emotional mumbo jumbo
[1:08:45] TurboBased: OMEGALUL

[1:08:57] madgarlicjr: preach brother fight the power
[1:08:58] likedasany: LOL
[1:08:59] obstata: he bought the game.
[1:09:00] HrdScp: it cant?
[1:09:04] TheEyeVII: it can't
[1:09:06] Mister_Chamfer: also the artistic merit in all examples is completely down to subjectivity
[1:09:08] Vehicle_King: what if
[1:09:10] craboskai: it can't tho KEKL
[1:09:11] numblezzz: i bet this dude has so much fucking reddit karma
[1:09:11] cin0tv: Look his response
[1:09:15] cornstar15: why couldn't ai conjure worlds? it's not that far off....not at all
[1:09:16] Educ4ted: He buys those games. assigning value.
[1:09:21] Vehicle_King: what if pigs could fly Peggers
[1:09:22] Dman2848: check out that fully AI generated movie trailer
[1:09:24] Dman2848: it looks insane
[1:09:24] Zeshyo: A lot of People are not able to accept truth when it hurts. Mostly because Parents dont confronted them with bad things and just said everythings alright even though they knew its sht.
[1:09:30] madgarlicjr: it cant, AI is a LIE its not real AI, its a scam, its a sham, its a HOAX!
[1:09:46] pikwi406: pikwi406 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 17 woo :)
[1:09:55] TheEyeVII: you're talking about a sentient Ai which doesn't exist, you'd have to fuse some biology with a machine or something & it'd basically sci fi
[1:10:04] numblezzz: is AI porn ethical? monkaHmm
[1:10:10] cornstar15: it all boils down to one man's trash is another man's treasure
[1:10:11] ClinxyWow: @StaysafeTV where did you get that map with all the states that stand with texas?
[1:10:23] puntingyograndma: @Zeshyo luckily tall buildings exist
[1:10:28] okayyomi: Yeah i feel there is a disconnect here
[1:10:31] Zantetsu13: can you explain the difference between an AI looking at art and making imitations or pictures based on that or any of the artists learning to draw after looking at art their whole lives? How do we know that a famous musicians music doesn't exist mainly because of the music they have heard throughout their life. Other than the AI being faster is there actually a way to prove its different
[1:10:36] hersh__69: the guy is just being emotional imo
[1:10:47] NutterCircus: Asmon is just still mad the Starforge emblem still looks like a cock.
[1:11:14] sound_wayv: the cock hammer was for sure planned ahead
[1:11:16] madgarlicjr: this argument could be made for everything other than food, water, and shelter
[1:11:20] WhaleBlast: @Zantetsu13 trueee
[1:11:24] Tomoglaziat: there have been a couple of exception Picasso annd Dale coem to mind
[1:11:24] craboskai: because AI isn't human KEKL
[1:11:25] numblezzz: humans are cringe and mad they are getting replaced
[1:11:37] hersh__69: @numblezzz YEP
[1:11:42] puntingyograndma: cant wait for megman battle netwrok irl
[1:11:42] kelvystorm: @StaysafeTV all artists take inspiration from existing art
[1:11:46] Vehicle_King: Ai just doing what its programmed to. A Human has experiences that shape them.
[1:11:48] puntingyograndma: adapt or die
[1:11:49] tussmack: people want real meat not lab grown meat
[1:12:00] saberign: art is almost the same as music some people find different music genres more appealing than others
[1:12:04] zezella03: I had a digital artist make emotes for me and this one is my fav zezellZeus
[1:12:10] TheEyeVII: @Zantetsu13 it's inspiration vs plagiarism imo
[1:12:13] WhaleBlast: @Zantetsu13 also, prompting requires just as much of an imagination, just less skill. AI democratised art.
[1:12:13] Dman2848: but ai is closing that gap of quality over quantity
[1:12:18] lucknow7: ohkatieNoted
[1:12:21] numblezzz: both those craftsmen still exist for the sake of preserving that culture
[1:12:23] WhaleBlast: this prompting can bring that back!
[1:12:25] itsbrysontv: min maxing basically
[1:12:25] numblezzz: same will happen with AI art
[1:12:27] Vehicle_King: but we lifted all those chinese out of poverty /s
[1:12:29] N45TY_69: +architecture
[1:12:38] likedasany: everyone takes inspiration from existing things..
[1:12:41] sound_wayv: i own this sandwich i just made
[1:12:45] WhaleBlast: many things but I'm from a family of artists
[1:12:54] Probulator: the AI that generated a rocket engine is insane
[1:12:56] madgarlicjr: my painting of bart simpson smoking a blunt
[1:13:10] Vehicle_King: worst part is when consumers scoff at the prices of actual handmade objects.
[1:13:13] maddie_1994: I have a chess board that was made by my grandpa
[1:13:15] WhaleBlast: it democratised art
[1:13:21] Mister_Chamfer: I have an original piece of art and a vintage guitar, thats all
[1:13:28] harvenius: @WhaleBlast what does that even mean?
[1:13:33] numblezzz: i made this comparison 5 min ago, plagiarism
[1:13:43] Lmgd1: Lmgd1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! I disagree with everything you saying.
[1:13:44] WhaleBlast: @harvenius everyone can make art, art is by the people for the people
[1:13:45] zezella03: I have a piece of glass work that my grandpa made me
[1:13:54] marceltheold: I disagree.Art and manufacturing arent the same. Art is supposed to be a talent and has soul
[1:13:59] TheEndIsNear777: but i prefer human having jobs so they can feed their families over ANY advantage AI can bring :)
[1:13:59] madgarlicjr: LMGD1 is right
[1:14:02] thimpaxd: the easy way to put it, theres no money in it, so ppl dont do it anymore (barely)
[1:14:02] Xephyr282: forsenBased
[1:14:05] Ahnzh: i built my desk and my wardrobes, my bed and most of my kitchen myself. and not the ikea style of myself
[1:14:08] HrdScp: BASED art hipsters
[1:14:15] tussmack: art is different from a chair, a chairs primary function is to sit on, for art its basically only *how you feel* about it
[1:14:18] Maxifrog: Lmgd1 gotem
[1:14:19] rullehjem: I'll just buy second hand
[1:14:23] TurboBased: hopefully people will crave authentic craftsmanship again
[1:14:24] numblezzz: humanists DIESOFCRINGE
[1:14:24] Vehicle_King: its why i dont shop at walmart, target, etc anymore. Shop local
[1:14:25] NutterCircus: Everyone is gonna wanna go back EleGiggle
[1:14:27] Probulator: mass production vs hand made
[1:14:29] zezella03: but you pay the price for those things
[1:14:30] harvenius: @WhaleBlast how does that have any bearing on "democracy"?
[1:14:33] MattyFuffins: nah. people will always want their cheap consumer crap
[1:14:36] Lmgd1: He didnt thank my sub :(
[1:14:40] RelaxExo: that’s already the case tho
[1:14:40] itsbrysontv: opinion on the e/acc movement?
[1:14:51] rawreefers: Matt where is everyone playing Palworld?
[1:14:51] neumond8: I want people to be able to make games solo, as in 90s. Without few monopolies controlling the whole market
[1:14:52] redcrimtane: I have that where i live, but it's not a huge city, and most of the people here are wealthy or middle class
[1:14:56] Burger_Phil: Only the rich
[1:14:56] Educ4ted: @Lmgd1 wow what a shit streamer
[1:14:57] rawreefers: why*
[1:14:59] Sinycc: Dont forget all the microplastics in EVERYTHING as a result of all that cheap chinese plastic shit
[1:15:03] WhaleBlast: @harvenius democratised is not just about democracy. demo (people) cratised (ruled)
[1:15:07] TheEndIsNear777: China :(
[1:15:08] jaynkumz: @StaysafeTV Its the "industrial revolution" of AI in general right now not just art; finance, engineering, etc are all having their own great strides in it.
[1:15:08] noChance219: Buy them some junk Peggers
[1:15:11] itsbrysontv: SigmaArrive

[1:15:25] kosmolson: It's an action figure dad
[1:15:25] ScarfaceCEO: Imagine reading books in the future written by AI vs the connection from a human author.  There is something to the human connection for sure.
[1:15:27] TurboBased: true
[1:15:27] TheEyeVII: do you include your phone as the plastic junk LUL
[1:15:29] Probulator: just go with giftcards

[1:15:32] AceOfFlame: My family just gives me clothes KEKW

[2:17:13] Plokoon100: no OW2 pve.  no survivor game. what are they doing over there !
[2:17:15] bignerdtv: YOUr  next gm IN wow WILL BE AN ai :)
[2:17:16] OlympicUSA: i was expecting more info on that game at blizzcon
[2:17:31] ATcaribou: @bignerdtv you good bro?
[2:17:40] hiniku_hyena_martyr: Agreed
[2:17:43] lehandenberg: based
[2:17:44] hiniku_hyena_martyr: Get em out
[2:17:45] crenger: based
[2:17:45] pappej: At least 50 million
[2:17:45] numblezzz: thats a lot of medieval cannons we gotta build
[2:17:46] Vehicle_King: The companies that employ those illegals would never allow that. Thats just lip service....
[2:17:50] TurboBased: they gotta go back
[2:17:50] sound_wayv: theres a worker shortage though apparently
[2:17:51] biggus__dikkus: amen brother
[2:17:52] bignerdtv: SHUT DOWN THE ai BOTTER BORDER IN wOw EleGiggle
[2:17:56] Taicho116: End birthright citizenship
[2:17:56] hiniku_hyena_martyr: I think it will under Trump
[2:17:58] Sharksleep: i would take any deportations at this point
[2:18:04] SpoolyZ02: Sadly they are given $3000 by the border patrol and a cell phone
[2:18:08] ManoloGa: whos doing all the jobs then
[2:18:08] SpoolyZ02: they arent going anywhere
[2:18:13] Probulator: wonder what AI has to say about an open border system
[2:18:21] Snaketrap: YEP
[2:18:26] sound_wayv: a lot farmers in florida had to shutdown when desantis cracked down on hired illegal immigrants
[2:18:40] TesservcT: born in the land of the free
[2:18:44] Vehicle_King: They distract you with "border border border", but have no plans for economy, healthcare, jobs, infrastructure, etc.
[2:18:45] lolsmileyface666: you can hail mary pass an american birth
[2:18:46] SepeIio: makes no sense
[2:19:00] OrganikCum: yea vivek was talking about how legally he would be able to deport all of those people
[2:19:04] SpoolyZ02: Yeah but then all of us wouldnt be considered americans
[2:19:05] ClinxyWow: so wouldnt mass deportation be taking parents away from babbies?
[2:19:06] numblezzz: anchor babies Pog
[2:19:07] midinette: It's something illegals use to their advantage
[2:19:24] Vehicle_King: America needs more taxpayers, or we never get to retire. Sad but true
[2:19:31] Probulator: @freedomfighter999 but AI receives information from human activity
[2:19:34] ManoloGa: its more taxpayers though
[2:19:36] OrganikCum: we HAVE TO put them on a plane or bus and ship them out, sorry not sorry
[2:19:38] TurboBased: illegals incentivized to have children but not citizens KEKL
[2:19:45] hiniku_hyena_martyr: Ya but Vivek is Indian @organikcum
[2:19:45] Chubbie_Banana: anchor babies
[2:19:46] midinette: just deport both the babies and the parents. It sucks for them but the system needs to be changed.
[2:19:57] TurboBased: YEP
[2:20:01] OrganikCum: vivek is american
[2:20:01] Sinycc: America is a BUSINESS. If you think otherwise you are insane.
[2:20:08] Probulator: @freedomfighter999 ooo thats scary
[2:20:08] Snaketrap: YEP i want big GDP numbers
[2:20:12] SpoolyZ02: That will never be america, but we can want all we want
[2:20:14] Taicho116: @Vehicle_King the idea that most people are net contributors is crazy.
[2:20:15] BudweiserDNA: wouldnt that be nice
[2:20:16] indocl0ud: America is a money focused country sadly
[2:20:18] ManoloGa: usa literally has no culture
[2:20:18] DankWizard420: never happening, the us isnt homogenous KEKW
[2:20:23] TurboBased: I want a nation
[2:20:31] lolsmileyface666: @Sinycc news flash the world was always this way
[2:20:35] keanway: isnt immigration a huge part of what america is?
[2:20:36] SepeIio: but my friends on reddit said it
[2:20:41] TheFreedomLover: burger king culture
[2:20:46] SpoolyZ02: America doesnt have an culture that dates far back though
[2:20:49] hiniku_hyena_martyr: Someone has never been to the south
[2:20:50] DuoX: american culture is as diverse as europe , just with the same language
[2:20:51] ThePlayerCoachStun: Birthright citizenship does not automatically grant legal status to the parents. The child's birth in the U.S. does not change the immigration status of the parents, and they may still be subject to deportation if they are in the country without authorization.
[2:20:53] OrganikCum: LEGAL immigration is
[2:21:00] Probulator: how long do you think until we have an AI president?
[2:21:01] biggus__dikkus: LEGAL immigration
[2:21:01] Vehicle_King: @Taicho116 Never said that. And "they" dont want people to be net contributors. Just sheep that keep voting them into power.
[2:21:11] Av3nturA: give indians america back  !
[2:21:24] helmetnach0s: crazy how people can’t differentiate between legal and illegal immigration
[2:21:30] OrganikCum: legal immigrants are very welcomed here, illegals can get fucked. bye
[2:21:32] hiniku_hyena_martyr: But you are bragging
[2:21:34] carlos_the_7th: America used to be just Europe 2.0
[2:21:41] kurupone: BASED 󠀀
[2:21:48] TurboBased: YEP
[2:21:49] Vehicle_King: you had to be white passing
[2:21:58] DefaTL: had to be a certain class and spec to raid USA
[2:22:01] madgarlicjr: america used to be a ultra hardcore raiding guild
[2:22:02] lolsmileyface666: YO QUEUE UP FOR AMERICA PogChamp
[2:22:12] SirSpergAlot: saving the core of a culture :D
[2:22:15] hiniku_hyena_martyr: But the GDP
[2:22:22] DefaTL: LFG USA parse run
[2:22:22] jfauxy23: server queue USA
[2:22:23] pappej: Even Abraham Lincoln, the emancipator, wanted to send the blacks back to Africa after emancipation
[2:22:34] helmetnach0s: The illegals Vs Border Patrol is just toxic premade pvp
[2:22:40] SpoolyZ02: Lincoln had a plan for africans to have their own island
[2:22:45] coeursiy: hilarious that people conflate exclusively northern and western europeans with hondurans and guatemalans
[2:22:49] Curwen89: so what about all those italians...
[2:22:52] thecollector313: abe lincon also killed vamps
[2:22:58] Taicho116: Also the amount of gibs in 1900 vs now is a big deal.
[2:23:03] madgarlicjr: not my president
[2:23:03] hiniku_hyena_martyr: Immigration retards wouldn't even have an economy argument if natives just had families
[2:23:16] cockjab: @CrazyTiger86 KEKW
[2:23:18] sound_wayv: even that was progressive at the time
[2:23:23] Sinycc: @coeursiy EU colonized them, so close enough /s
[2:23:24] bignerdtv: NOW! YOU ARE SENDING PROPGANDA
[2:23:25] SippinSimpSyrup: and even after having that belief he still knew slavery was wrong
[2:23:28] ngrett81: abraham lincon was pre nfl
[2:23:28] bertLtheturtle: Ummmmm
[2:23:31] madgarlicjr: then some dumb ass shot him before he could finish the job
[2:23:31] SpoolyZ02: Did he say that in those words though? Context means alot.
[2:23:34] alienistslol: we wouldn't have any snowbunnies then Sadge
[2:23:41] numblezzz: there was black politicians/leaders that also wanted to return to africa, they believed they could never belong in white society
[2:23:50] Krazymutha817: cap
[2:23:51] LabraDuck: thats how every where still is, outside the west
[2:23:57] Curwen89: and then you got liberia..
[2:23:58] DankWizard420: is the electoral college going to be changed/removed in our lifetime? monkaHmm
[2:24:06] DuoX: racial jungle according to biden
[2:24:11] madgarlicjr: it was just lawless for a long time tbh
[2:24:21] ceth3rnaut: thank god for that
[2:24:23] TurboBased: it was never a melting pot
[2:24:27] Probulator: but is the idea of blacks not living with whites based on social norms at the time instead of reality?
[2:24:30] sound_wayv: we have the power to change that now though
[2:24:32] SpoolyZ02: Is that what Americans want though is to return to a state like that again?
[2:24:34] pappej: @freedomfighter999 Do you know what conquering is?
[2:24:47] coeursiy: emancipation was cruel in a way, forcing low IQ, illiterate former slaves to integrate into an industrialized European society and support themselves
[2:24:48] hiniku_hyena_martyr: It was a European melting pot, that's about it @turbobased
[2:24:48] Noitheknight333: but idk if those historical immigration policies matter
[2:24:59] numblezzz: it was specifically a north-western european state. no southern/easterners
[2:25:09] Noitheknight333: give an example of a different value or ideal
[2:25:11] Curwen89: like the chinese?
[2:25:17] kurupone: true and real
[2:25:21] pappej: @freedomfighter999 Yeah so how is mass migration related to this? KEKL
[2:25:21] biggus__dikkus: yup
[2:25:25] Tacohealer: It us to be part of the American dream to become American, not stay how you are in the country you left/fled
[2:25:26] sound_wayv: thats a fair point
[2:25:28] SippinSimpSyrup: it would be more natural to assimilate with our neighbors, canada and mexico then the world
[2:25:33] LegendFromWoW: and expecting us to accommodate
[2:25:42] vsulol: why dont we teach the immigrants english anymore
[2:25:43] Vehicle_King: They said the same thing about Italian, Irish, etc migrants back in the day. People have no patience.
[2:25:49] Wingsofjanitor: The Babylon approach PogU
[2:26:01] Knaldstiv: impossible
[2:26:03] DankWizard420: ah, the danish approach
[2:26:08] pappej: @CrazyTiger86 BASED
[2:26:12] Curwen89: like the germans?
[2:26:19] coeursiy: @Vehicle_King newsflash: mexicans aren't italian or irish
[2:26:26] kurupone: if you pick up africa, you will be africa
[2:26:32] dontbecold: That reminds me of this old crazy video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDqArpz9q5Y
[2:26:33] Noitheknight333: I think if you took 10 thousand whites from new york and place them in texas youd have a collective of people who wouldnt' assimilate
[2:26:45] Vehicle_King: @coeursiy Who said they were? The point is even white migrants coming here LEGALLY were frowned up, hated, and targeted.
[2:26:47] satelolxd: yep, Turks in Germany are holding the culture of 60-80s Turkey, not even "modern"
[2:26:53] SepeIio: D:
[2:26:54] numblezzz: imagine what the swedish ancestors think of what their descendants have allowed. so sad
[2:26:56] hairfair88: Sweden is a pure horror story in that regard.
[2:26:57] lucknow7: D:
[2:27:01] SpoolyZ02: But thats ran by the US government, not the people
[2:27:02] Probulator: based
[2:27:05] LegendFromWoW: NODDERS
[2:27:11] speedzombie: @StaysafeTV have you watched any channel 5 videos
[2:27:14] OrganikCum: those poor cartels just trying to make a living wage though
[2:27:14] SippinSimpSyrup: but i like narco docu series
[2:27:15] Tacohealer: @StaysafeTV one of my children's grades are about 1 out of 3 speak only Spanish, and they work off ditto sheets with no effect to teach english or check work
[2:27:18] SpoolyZ02: Blame that on the government for allowing it and funding that.
[2:27:18] pappej: @hairfair88 The US is worse off than Sweden my man
[2:27:22] biggus__dikkus: One way legal immigration works is green card lottery (that’s how I got mine) a set quota every year. after that you need background checks and health checks. file paperwork. takes ~3 years.
[2:27:27] bagpipezz: would it surprise you to find out that most fetinal mules are white?
[2:27:35] deathnntaxes: bro fentynol is blowing up where i live
[2:27:37] Ahnzh: schools can rent chemistry rooms out to cooking meth, no?
[2:27:37] madgarlicjr: i think andrew has gone anti american
[2:27:39] Vehicle_King: Blame China for them sending fentanyl.
[2:27:42] numblezzz: @pappej america doesnt have any sharia no-go zones that even police refuse to enter
[2:27:42] Plokoon100: Americans should start immigrating to Mexico Ans take it over.
[2:27:48] DankWizard420: couldve had that if it was included an official language..ever but never was KEKW
[2:27:51] dr_cia_again: european english
[2:27:55] jfauxy23: have you seen the tranq fentanyl?
[2:27:56] hiniku_hyena_martyr: Yiddish
[2:28:00] LegendFromWoW: Not knowing English is also an issue for your personal safety. If a disaster happens and you're in a place without an interpreter available you're SOL.
[2:28:00] coeursiy: @Vehicle_King they weren't, and you're comparing apples and oranges. people aren't interchangeable
[2:28:04] sound_wayv: fentanyl is mainly from china
[2:28:20] Vehicle_King: @coeursiy They were though. But keep your head in the sand I guess.
[2:28:24] icene__: lol
[2:28:26] OrganikCum: he lives near protland, so yes he has seen tranq lol, they are all over the vancouver area now
[2:28:27] Wingsofjanitor: The Gringo Ghettos Madge
[2:28:28] SirSpergAlot: boing flip
[2:28:31] unscconnor2: Not too fun when it happens to them hmmm
[2:28:33] Probulator: damn spring breakers
[2:28:34] ScarfaceCEO: There are some precursors in fentanyl that can all be traced to one lab in China.
[2:28:35] wookinit: hey me and my friend are doing that KEKW
[2:28:36] pawgdog: lmao
[2:28:42] DankWizard420: the us is in a proxy fent war between china and the cartels pepeLaugh
[2:28:45] pappej: @numblezzz We don't either KEKL
[2:28:55] jfauxy23: theres fentanyl laced with horse tranq in philly going around
[2:29:02] kurupone: didnt this pawn shop guys son died to fantanyl
[2:29:10] DefaTL: sound fine honestly
[2:29:12] Raivan994: have you seen crip mac is back in jail?
[2:29:13] chunky1983: @jfauxy23 philly has been screwed for years
[2:29:15] sound_wayv: yeah
[2:29:25] OrganikCum: general fat death
[2:29:27] SippinSimpSyrup: one dude sold meth on that show
[2:29:28] unscconnor2: it was an OD but i dont know if it was fent
[2:29:28] just_ouro: The fentanyl situation in the United States is so tragic. It's so bad amongst the youth that school children are being taught how to inject others with narcan.
[2:29:34] wookinit: to fentynal the dad came out and blamed biden and the border
[2:29:34] Vehicle_King: @freedomfighter999 They cant, they always need an "out" group to target. To keep their base scared and afraid of the "others".
[2:30:07] BudweiserDNA: its because its soo cheap anyone can buy it and its every where
[2:30:07] Taicho116: @Vehicle_King  You just did what you don't want others to do " They can't"
[2:30:08] pappej: It's insane how many problems just go away if you close the border and deport millions
[2:30:08] SpoolyZ02: We blame mexicans for fent, yet the US funds these cartels under the table. Who is really to blame?
[2:30:09] Taicho116: lmao
[2:30:17] lolsmileyface666: world problem, species problem
[2:30:20] OrganikCum: if a fatty OD's that's just speeding up the process they started by eating, no big loss there
[2:30:20] lolsmileyface666: imho
[2:30:39] Curwen89: but muh portugal...
[2:30:44] deathnntaxes: i personally know 3 people who have died to fentynol, and i dont do drugs or associate with people that do. insane. one was just a kid 17, it was mixed in his coke
[2:30:45] deathnntaxes: big GG
[2:30:55] madgarlicjr: ApuApustaja
[2:30:57] Vehicle_King: @Taicho116 Sorry facts upset you.
[2:31:19] LegendFromWoW: that's rough, subboxone is bad I work in healthcare. if they run out they freak out like theyre out of a hard drug.
[2:31:20] Tacohealer: #RIPTom
[2:31:21] keanway: people will always do drugs no matter the regulation
[2:31:30] midinette: A girl I liked in middle school visited me at my job once and she looked great. Saw her again  like a year later and her teeth were all methed out.
[2:31:31] buklebowski: suboxone is a mother to get off of too
[2:31:32] SpoolyZ02: Is the fentynal epidemic the fault of the distributors or the people consuming?
[2:31:35] Tacohealer: @StaysafeTV Yes, same with Methodone
[2:31:36] Raewhen: sub ox one?
[2:31:39] coeursiy: @keanway how can someone do drugs if they can't get them
[2:31:43] Taicho116: @Vehicle_King what facts? You talked about how it is not good to generalize and then said " they can't" being a generalization lol.
[2:31:43] buklebowski: you have to taper very small amounts if u been on it for a long time
[2:31:44] ClinxyWow: it does the same thing as heroin
[2:31:52] EarSlug: yah or move them to the next drug
[2:32:03] SpoolyZ02: I put all the blame on the people consuming those drugs, its their problem
[2:32:06] SippinSimpSyrup: stand near the perimeter
[2:32:09] EarSlug: i have 2 uncles that abuse that
[2:32:13] keanway: @coeursiy youre naive
[2:32:19] Snaketrap: monkaSpin
[2:32:28] buklebowski: got a 72 hour half life though lol
[2:32:28] obstata: it gets u high tho, so whats the point, a new drug
[2:32:29] zaebot3000: @StaysafeTV I am currently on suboxone. Lots of doctors from around the country recommend they stay on it forever. Some much better doctors recommend you use it for about a year until your newly sober life is stable and then you taper off.
[2:32:36] ClinxyWow: it for sure makes you feel good
[2:32:38] coeursiy: @keanway and you're an idiot who can't answer a simple question
[2:32:43] grizz430: people just get fucked up on Suboxone, it helps nothing
[2:32:48] Mawshaw: @SpoolyZ02 Such bad bait
[2:32:53] Vehicle_King: @Taicho116 Are you denying that R's target "others"? trans, migrants, literally anyone who isnt them? Sorry that upsets you to learn.
[2:32:59] iknowido: suboxone gets you high too
[2:33:08] SpoolyZ02: Nah, if you cant control yourself to not do drugs, thats your problem
[2:33:09] pappej: I'd rather people couldn't choose to do drugs and have drug dealers put away for life
[2:33:18] Raewhen: Ive never done drugs recreationally, but I got some Fentanyl for a medical procedure once. I had a GREAT time. I can totally understand how someone could get addicted to that and throw their life away chasing it. It was a real eye opener.
[2:33:26] Mawshaw: @SpoolyZ02 Oh you're just a fucking moron then ICANT
[2:33:27] cerealkillas22: take it all GIGACHAD
[2:33:35] pappej: Even if people are weak willed and choose to do drugs it's still just as tragic
[2:33:36] cerealkillas22: TAKE ALL THAT DICK GIGACHAD
[2:33:40] pappej: Just get it out of society
[2:33:45] ClinxyWow: dont boomkins want arcane damage?
[2:33:48] ClinxyWow: idk never played one
[2:33:57] DuoX: set pieces dont match
[2:33:58] pappej: @freedomfighter999 Or just close the border FeelsWeirdMan
[2:34:03] pappej: We did not have these issues before
[2:34:04] Probulator: @freedomfighter999 the new drug seems to be human trafficking
[2:34:06] Lionkingler1: trinket is giga rare
[2:34:06] hennessy147: trinket is shit anyways
[2:34:13] Wingsofjanitor: lube it up billyReady
[2:34:23] DirtyDARR3N: I’m addicted to cocaine , fucking up my life
[2:34:24] hennessy147: its just 5 shadow res for 30mins
[2:34:33] just_ouro: Looking at the differential between the United States and Europe with opiate overdoses was initially surprising to me. But I think that you highlighted the primary causes quite well.
[2:34:33] Taicho116: @Vehicle_King I do 100% disagree with that. But that has nothing to do with the statement of . We shouldn't do X and then you proceed to do X. You either don't like generalizations or you just don't like it when they don't like the generlization.
[2:34:35] krull6: what did you just put on your wep?
[2:34:40] SepeIio: KEKW
[2:34:40] cerealkillas22: Cocaine is only fun for like 20-30 minutes

[2:35:07] SirSpergAlot: utopy inc
[2:35:08] coeursiy: libertarians are so fucking retarded
[2:35:09] Vehicle_King: @Taicho116 I didnt generalize. I stated a fact. Again, sorry facts upset you so much. Thats strange.
[2:35:13] dontbecold: Peggers We need an annual purge
[2:35:15] SpoolyZ02: Thats what we should do but the US would rather allow it
[2:35:18] Snaketrap: YEP then people will just sniff glue
[2:35:23] DirtyDARR3N: @cerealkillas22 first couple lines and then it goes down hill
[2:35:24] madgarlicjr: we need jesus
[2:35:27] stealthx831: illegal drugs will always be cheaper
[2:35:41] Sinycc: America would first have to admit the "War on Drugs" was a colossal failure. Which they never will.
[2:35:43] Kushiize: because all those things make money i dont think they will ever go away
[2:35:55] Snaketrap: KEKW

[2:36:13] likedasany: get that strap
[2:36:14] Probulator: they can just lace a legal drug with an illegal drug
[2:36:14] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Oakland is a good example of legalized drugs
[2:36:17] cerealkillas22: Cocaine will sober you up insta from alcohol though which is very BASED
[2:36:29] pappej: @carlos_the_7th He's 95 IQ thinking he's smarter than everyone KEKL
[2:36:35] Snaketrap: YEP make American portugal again
[2:36:37] ascension_girl: i have a full bis mage lvl 25, do u think they will allow us to freeze xp gains? (like for twinking and whatever else reason)

[2:37:35] SirSpergAlot: is this a roadmap for places to be?
[2:37:37] Vehicle_King: @Taicho116 It's not a generalization, and you trying to claim it is doesnt make it true. Keep falling for the culture war and propaganda BS.
[2:37:41] the_poon_monsoon: RFK has a good take on this - Legalize weed federally and use the tax revenue for rehab facilities for harder drugs

[2:42:51] SpoolyZ02: Actually a government problem considering they fund drugs coming into the US
[2:42:54] cerealkillas22: WEED AND COCAINE IS ALL SOCIETY NEEDS BASED
[2:43:00] Probulator: @freedomfighter999 its because we have a surplus of people who take advantage of human weaknesses rather than people who will to promote human strengths
[2:43:04] JakeDive: literally i just want some coke
[2:43:15] KCYON: @likedasany San francisco's APEC summit showed the states can clean up their cities

[2:44:14] vsulol: i was a full blown drug addict but never did opiates
[2:44:16] caremeter: Foreign countries have been raping our youth for decades.  People on the left feel bad for them people on the right want to kill the drug dealers.  Seomwhere in the middle in the answer
[2:44:17] Chadmagus: same argument could be used for guns
[2:44:17] kurupone: its the new world order to natural selection YEP

[2:44:36] obstata: its a weak soy approach
[2:44:38] unscconnor2: He has bascally just given up. He cant add to a solution
[2:44:43] KCYON: @JakeDive yup similar, not as horrible but pretty damn awful honestly.
[2:44:45] SpoolyZ02: death is literally the only thing that will stop people from doing things they shouldnt
[2:44:55] caremeter: Drug addiction is NOT human nature.  Thats some left wing garbo brain rot-think.
[2:44:59] bottlekiddz: i feel like every culture has a way of self medicating though
[2:45:04] pappej: @freedomfighter999 So what is your solution?
[2:45:14] b1acksheeptw: they dont have a solution
[2:45:14] just_ouro: I'm not the well versed in pharmacology. What typically gets prescribed for pain besides opiates?
[2:45:27] gressil1234: women?
[2:45:28] SirSpergAlot: i think its because most people dont think they will ever exit the situation living on the streets
[2:45:29] JakeDive: hating god
[2:45:30] Lionkingler1: cost of living
[2:45:32] sargent_baddy: Western problems
[2:45:35] KCYON: we've always had stimulants in every civilization. "Highs" are natural. Endorphins, orgasms, etc. we've just synthesized that now.

[5:15:31] Buttsworth: illuminati vs texas
[5:15:32] AintFinnaSubscribe: If the feds go hard on Texas, that will only make Biden more unlikely to win the 24 election
[5:15:33] bigwank69: Biden is a treasonous president
[5:15:37] slachi: There are more people in the county of Los Angeles than in any of states that support this. It's a non-issue
[5:15:42] MarcoFlee: at the same time, it makes them look weak
[5:15:44] AintFinnaSubscribe: he has an election to think about, he can't go for the bad optics
[5:15:45] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader You can tell that you've studied anything correctly. Your entire intellect is built around infographics.
[5:15:48] xJ3KYLL: Imagine thinking Biden will still be the nominee come Nov
[5:15:49] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt it's not retarded, the democracy we have in the West doesn't really work imo
[5:16:02] marceltheold: Look at what they are doing to Trump, you think they still care about optics and the law?
[5:16:03] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt people give up their power to others by voting on them
[5:16:06] Kohvos: tbf biden always looks bad
[5:16:17] CoachHuffine: Abbott just needs to send Biden some ice cream?
[5:16:29] Fennyyy: they are just biden their time EZ
[5:16:31] AintFinnaSubscribe: the timing of this has to be on purpose for the election
[5:16:36] Buttsworth: vote for dementia
[5:16:38] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader Just because you say things, doesn't mean those things are correct or make sense.
[5:16:44] Doribob1: @AintFinnaSubscribe always
[5:17:00] hart_mk1: exercise your just authority lmao

[5:17:20] marceltheold: Agenda > than everything else. They have a deadline to meet
[5:17:23] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt Hey man, in the end that's okay right. Because that's freedom of speech and democracy. The system you love so much.
[5:17:24] LoRswat: if Biden does something, he can kiss the Popular Vote good-bye.  And he'll lose Texas by more than 10 points....instead of 4 or 5 points
[5:17:25] slachi: He'll just arrest the leaders and people will forget in 2 days
[5:17:28] NooleanB: what we talking about?  Israel response?
[5:17:29] Morgrainne_Nost: never know, Dems vote for him anyway

[5:17:36] Rejuvasaur: as a proud Texan….you want the razor wire Biden, come and take it. Texas forever
[5:17:36] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader You're just talking to yourself.
[5:17:40] Merex760: It's all just political games. Neither party is going to do shit about the border. They all love the cheep labor.
[5:17:54] NonninoXXX: So fun to see you playing wsg. I havent played sinced i ranked back in the days. I used to calculate with the addons, battleground targets, spawntimers and minimap always visible. is that still a thing?
[5:18:01] mcbutttz: mcbutttz gifted a Tier 1 sub to Buttsworth! They have given 16 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[5:18:07] LoRswat: some pundits are pointing at May for Biden to drop out
[5:18:08] NooleanB: Foreign policy is fucked because Trump sold state secrets :P
[5:18:19] marceltheold: Exactly
[5:18:24] Milanesa_De_Pollo: scorched earth like Trudeau YEP
[5:18:24] xJ3KYLL: Biden will step down, someone else will step up for the November ballot
[5:18:28] iknowido: yes!!!!!
[5:18:32] arcantio123: @NonninoXXX they changed the ranking system in classic wow now so you dont have to deal with bracket stuff as much
[5:18:33] iknowido: content
[5:18:37] BokajLive: You hear the Kari Lake recording?!
[5:18:39] Lionkingler1: YEP bomb the wire
[5:18:41] thenewguy176: pretend they do, then texas starts fighting back
[5:18:45] thenewguy176: then 25 states start fighting back
[5:18:49] Fennyyy: they already nerfed them Sadge
[5:18:54] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt Do you think technocracy would be a better system. Lobbying would be banned. Money doesn't mean power.
[5:18:55] Shoohk: what server

[5:19:05] Shoohk: damn.
[5:19:09] Shoohk: Living Flame bby
[5:19:11] Mauraderss: I feel if the military is sent to Texas, there will be casualties 100%
[5:19:11] DobsonWireless: ill go
[5:19:16] DobsonWireless: 25 lock named Dobs
[5:19:25] marceltheold: Chaos and conflict gives them what they want. Just like J6. They wanted more out of J^. If they can justify Marshal Law they can easily steal the next "election". Keep that in mind
[5:19:26] thenewguy176: Texas citizens care more about the state then they do the fed
[5:19:28] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt people with lower iqs aren't allowed to vote for example.
[5:19:51] NonninoXXX: @arcantio123 i fucked hated poolboosting hahaha. get br1 750k honor. took sooo much time
[5:19:53] DobsonWireless: wait lol nvm
[5:19:56] Kohvos: texas national guard already there tho or no?
[5:19:59] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader There's the world in which we live in and there's this fantasy you've made up for yourself.
[5:19:59] NooleanB: Can't the US Gov just nationalize the Texas National guard and order them back to their barracks?
[5:20:05] Taicho116: Does this not count for Posse Comitatus for some reason?
[5:20:05] thenewguy176: we're with Texas when that shit happens, right?
[5:20:06] ryufromstreets6: do you really think military personnel would shoot our own innocent civs
[5:20:07] Shoohk: you legally cant deploy US military within US borders tho
[5:20:24] slachi: Republicans are way too old and fat to put up a fight LUL
[5:20:25] Cubanito06: so which dummy texan will be the idiot
[5:20:28] arcantio123: it would be national guard
[5:20:34] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt and you are a clown in this world. Don't forget about that.
[5:20:40] RueRunsIt: not enough testosterone in the men in the US for a real civil war kek
[5:20:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: A brother war is what "they" want.
[5:20:42] R3ga1: Thank god there is a difference in power between state and federal
[5:20:45] R3ga1: though
[5:20:46] coeursiy: @Shoohk cause biden would never do anything illegal
[5:20:47] marceltheold: @ryufromstreets6 Not all but enough would. Its another reason why they are trying to get illegals in the military.
[5:20:53] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader The difference between you an I is education. Go get some.
[5:21:03] Shoohk: @coeursiy bro. its legit in our constitution
[5:21:05] Morgrainne_Nost: Regardless of the fact immigration is a federal government purview; this all doesnt look well
[5:21:10] iBanEvader: @avoidedneXt You can't even answer a simple question
[5:21:11] Mauraderss: agreed
[5:21:12] vash61: this is some Facebook level delusion
[5:21:17] ticeyx: the military would prolly accept the order to go there but theres almost no chance they actually do anything once they get there, thats the point the military starts refusing orders, its the same idea when people talk about gun grabs, police always say they wont enforce it
[5:21:19] coeursiy: @Shoohk were you born yesterday? none of that matters
[5:21:24] NooleanB: I think it would be about the same as the MAGA lady who got shot trying to storm the capital
[5:21:25] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader You've said nothing of value
[5:21:26] heylowdub: kkona
[5:21:28] unscconnor2: I really do not think it will come down to that honestly
[5:21:31] LegendFromWoW: I wish the judges that voted to support Texas could appeal the other judge's choices.
[5:21:39] Shoohk: @coeursiy you must not understand how this works
[5:21:53] hart_mk1: i don't think the military would abide the order
[5:21:54] ryufromstreets6: @marceltheold that's a bit of a schizo take ngl
[5:21:57] avoidedneXt: @iBanEvader You are repeating info graphic propaganda tier ideology
[5:21:58] trippledipperski: Can we get freedomfighter999's take on this issue
[5:22:12] coeursiy: @Shoohk has the federal government ever done anything that violates the constitution y/n?
[5:22:17] heylowdub: not today's military kekw
[5:22:21] Unfragged: constitution and laws are only as good as the people that support and resist tyranny
[5:22:25] thenewguy176: no
[5:22:27] thenewguy176: they serve the country
[5:22:30] pizac7: lawful orders
[5:22:41] Knaldstiv: the serve to constitution no?
[5:22:45] ticeyx: you could see alot walk off the job
[5:22:45] R3ga1: they would violate the ucmj if its serious enough and defect
[5:22:52] marceltheold: @ryufromstreets6 So wasnt the idea of stealing elctions 15 years ago. Keep thinking that though. The people incharge are schizo
[5:22:54] PeasantNoMore: Can states impeach Biden if a single person dies at the border ?
[5:23:00] TheDastardlyD: a texan falls out of a guard tower many such cases
[5:23:02] Shoohk: @coeursiy The US Military WILL NOT deploy within US states. Every single military personal will deny that order as its un constitutional. Only National Guard can be deployed with marshal law and thats extremely hard for congress to approve
[5:23:03] hart_mk1: they serve the people, not the commander in chief. their oath is to the constitution and the people
[5:23:24] coeursiy: @Shoohk it was a yes or no question, don't need an essay
[5:23:25] Lionkingler1: president got to enfore that
[5:23:30] Shoohk: @coeursiy its not that simple for the president to say "deploy". it has to get absolute congress approval
[5:23:53] Utmost777: that wasn’t their decision though
[5:23:57] noChance219: It would be like "Federal Border Agents" or somesuch, right? Is that not the first line that would be tasked with something like this, or am I mistaken?
[5:24:11] Taicho116: @StaysafeTV Biden would have to use non military first because Posse Comitatus would be an easy out for military.
[5:24:15] arcantio123: it would be national guard, not military right?
[5:24:17] Cubanito06: so they are traitors or what?
[5:24:21] Shoohk: @arcantio123 correct
[5:24:22] TheDastardlyD: BASEDCIGAR deal with it
[5:24:23] Morgrainne_Nost: @StaysafeTV I would say arrest are more likely over the killing of a Texan, but I see all your points
[5:24:25] marceltheold: I spent 10 years in the Marine Corps. Yes most Marines would identify with the people but the leadership is a different story
[5:24:28] Merex760: Is it the US border or the Texas border though?
[5:24:37] ticeyx: i dont care if texas has the right to do it or not according to any law, i want them to do it
[5:24:38] Mauraderss: I agree with Texas, but Supreme Court rulings must be followed to maintain order
[5:24:40] Buttsworth: a civil war will be real good for US opposition when WW3 will come around
[5:24:45] bigwank69: @StaysafeTV the SCOTUS ruling was the Dred Scott case and it should be disregarded to preserve the nation
[5:24:48] hart_mk1: now that you've explained it in depth, i can see the gravity of the situation
[5:24:50] echoloch: Tx should be the new DC
[5:25:08] Morgrainne_Nost: True
[5:25:09] Merex760: Our enemies would love us to have a civil war. Playing right into that shit lol
[5:25:09] Morgrainne_Nost: no bueno
[5:25:16] LeggomyEggoNow: i just don't think that will happen
[5:25:23] kaiju_kin: schizo take is this kicks off china getting involved in today's skirmishes
[5:25:35] Rejuvasaur: it’s possible
[5:25:37] Utmost777: military can’t arrest you but they can escort fbi
[5:25:41] Cubanito06: a state disobeying lawful orders what does it sound like
[5:25:41] Shoohk: the USA is impossible to invade, military wise. Even if we had a civil war, no one is stupid enough to even try to invade
[5:25:56] marceltheold: The sooner people realize how insane the people pushing this are the better. They give them too much credit. They dont think like you
[5:25:56] drencro: seeing dem states flaunt scotus decisions in past i dont see an inconsistency
[5:26:05] Plathyy: i cant find a single news outlet thats siding with biden, i dont understand what hes doing
[5:26:07] supernapkin: demons are supposed to be immune to fear lol
[5:26:09] dtl78: troops on US land means we got alot bigger problems just like that
[5:26:17] LeggomyEggoNow: realistically abbott will let the federal agents onto that park to let people get processed again time will pass and then itll be forgotten
[5:26:29] Utmost777: not true
[5:26:35] Shoohk: @dtl78 lucky for us, we cant have troop on US lands
[5:26:40] Warriorfall: tssj
[5:26:40] slachi: They gonna get arrested, lose the ability vote, and texas will go blue
[5:26:46] AintFinnaSubscribe: staysafe is a rebel
[5:26:47] iknowido: o no its actually tyranny time
[5:26:49] thenewguy176: @slachi lol
[5:27:06] griffithismydaddy: abbott can't do shit mr wheels is disabled
[5:27:08] ticeyx: they 100% are doing the right thing, once a law or lawful order doesnt benefit the country it should be disobeyed
[5:27:09] iknowido: he doesnt even know whats happening yet
[5:27:11] hart_mk1: i agree but for some reason, well actually, i know why. the dems want the immigrants to vote for them so they want open borders, no?
[5:27:11] Plathyy: what is his reason for wanting the wire removed
[5:27:19] Utmost777: the scotus just struck down the injunction preventing biden from removing the razor wire. they didn’t rule on anything other than that. also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act#:~:text=The%20Posse%20Comitatus%20Act%20is,policies%20within%20the%20United%20States.
[5:27:21] bigwank69: Biden will push this to the max and there will be no election due to martial law
[5:27:22] TheDastardlyD: he wants more voters
[5:27:26] Plokoon100: Cant wait for SM raid
[5:27:27] SOAGGY: bidens a pussy
[5:27:31] AintFinnaSubscribe: @Plathyy they are preventing his future voters to enter
[5:27:40] marceltheold: The detail everyone is missing is that Biden is trying to Fedralize the National Guard. that would strip any military troops from the states ability to resist
[5:27:41] Plathyy: but he cant publically say that
[5:27:41] thenewguy176: they give him votes
[5:27:42] avoidedneXt: I think its safe to say that people who fund the DNC want an open border
[5:27:43] hart_mk1: so that said aliens can vote for his party
[5:27:43] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Joe Biden, or his puppeteers?
[5:27:43] Knaldstiv: hes a traitor
[5:27:51] LeggomyEggoNow: i think thats so silly to say but i agree that we cant just have illegal aliens running into america willy nilly
[5:28:03] Phorty__: sounds like hes taking advice from trudeau
[5:28:08] Merex760: I mean let's be real. So do Republicans to staff all those meat processing plants. But they'll never say that out loud
[5:28:16] Plathyy: this is just so fucking weird lol
[5:28:21] Shoohk: @marceltheold its okay, that wont ever happen
[5:28:31] SOAGGY: sounds like biden is going to get 10+million votes this election
[5:28:31] AintFinnaSubscribe: nooo! you can't just heckin make the border a heckin border! BatChest
[5:28:35] Lionkingler1: you are BASED
[5:28:40] xrazzaks: people are fucking stupid man
[5:28:42] Rejuvasaur: facts
[5:28:43] TheDastardlyD: illegals love biden because they're letting them in and the non existent voter verification basically guarantees a vote for him

[5:29:51] coeursiy: leftists just hate white people. more brown immigrants = whites lose power
[5:29:52] ATcaribou: @StaysafeTV heres the thing, nearly every american truly wants a secure border, but becuase thats become a big talking point for republicans, liberals have to pretend its some white supremecist talking point
[5:29:52] Utmost777: there was no sovereignty
[5:29:56] bigwank69: Europeans fled religious persecution
[5:29:58] EdgeK: BASED

[5:30:14] drencro: gaslighting the border issue as american as apple pie
[5:30:15] Shoohk: @marceltheold i get ya. but its nearly impossible to federalize the national guard because itll defeat its entire purpose
[5:30:16] LeggomyEggoNow: all they had was a vision and a dream with the ratification of the constitution

[5:32:32] ATcaribou: HES WEARING FLANNEL
[5:32:33] slachi: No, they realize the economy depends on illegal immigrant labor and the vast majority become net benefactors for the country.

[5:32:55] iBanEvader: @TheDastardlyD in the end we can't change what happened in the past but saying the colonialists didn't fuck over other people is complete evil
[5:32:58] n8morphy: Definitely because most streamers are left wing lol
[5:32:59] ongtehjem: because u married an immrigrant
[5:33:03] Shoohk: With GWOT ramping back up, this is all just too crazy to fathom
[5:33:08] iBanEvader: @TheDastardlyD it was a pure genocide
[5:33:11] marceltheold: Thats how they justify their behavior. They view the world in Oppressors and Oppressed. In their minds the Oppressed can do anything they want because they are fighting the evil oppressors
[5:33:13] ryguynva: Would you beat Xaryu in a duel?

[5:33:48] HrdScp: germany has this too
[5:33:50] snake_like: I forgot dumbasses actually use the term libtard unironically OMEGALUL . Your opinion goes in the trash instantly when you start with that shit
[5:33:51] coeursiy: @avoidedneXt okay so according to your worldview, leftists love white people and it's a coincidence that everything they advocate for is in opposition to the benefit of white people
[5:33:55] Hitzme401: he did close the boarder and was deporting non americans
[5:33:56] TurboBased: YEP
[5:33:56] Morgrainne_Nost: They absolutely do
[5:33:56] bikersrocha: I thought you were woke before

[5:34:14] bigwank69: politicians are bought and paid for stop believing them
[5:34:18] iknowido: @Hitzme401 didnt know
[5:34:21] avoidedneXt: @coeursiy Do you see how you're thinking in terms of black and white again? Just because I   disagree with you doesnt mean its opposite is true
[5:34:21] slachi: They shouldn't because open border is good for the economy
[5:34:31] TurboBased: but line go up
[5:34:32] iknowido: how long was it closed?
[5:34:34] Omahasteaks: the republican party is the democrat party with the brakes on
[5:34:36] Shoohk: @bigwank69 exactly. and the president isnt the only one pulling strings too
[5:34:42] avenomxx: if you want to come to America use the legal immigration way, its there. But you gotta wait in line like everyone else
[5:34:42] LeggomyEggoNow: the GoP use the border as like the carrot on the stick similar to when you guys had Roe V Wade to dangle in front of Evangelicals
[5:34:49] Mauraderss: an anti establishment republican
[5:34:50] hookmhorns: Cheap labor
[5:34:58] drencro: can self loathing whites get over the blood libel programming maybe not
[5:34:59] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Elite? You mean the Jesuits? Illuminati? Evangelicals?
[5:35:01] slachi: Trump did'nt close the border, and he would'nt if he won. He makes money off illegal labor
[5:35:01] hart_mk1: @slachi how is an open border good for the economy? please explain
[5:35:02] Pimplejewce: its honestly pathetic
[5:35:03] coeursiy: @avoidedneXt then provide a counter argument dummy. if racial hatred isn't the major factor then what is
[5:35:23] TurboBased: imagine how despicable you'd have to be to use a people's altruism against them
[5:35:24] marceltheold: Unless you understand the "establishments" endgame none of this will make sense. Nor will you understand the lengths they will go to accomplish it
[5:35:25] embarrassm3nt: I think the feelings are rooted in idealism
[5:35:35] Omahasteaks: if they're so worried about colonizing, why don't they move their white asses back to europe lol
[5:35:36] tomble_: should people who didnt win the birth lottery be given the opportunity to leave their incredibly dangerous / corrupt countries to make a better life in the states for their families?

[5:36:06] olashma: might makes right
[5:36:07] Knaldstiv: YEP
[5:36:08] avoidedneXt: @coeursiy I've explained my position to you. Ill do it again. This situtation is complicated and nuanced. It's bigger than the nazi propaganda you've digested. You make yourself and your movement look really stupid when you repeat baseless information.

[5:45:33] AintFinnaSubscribe: @StaysafeTV avoid microplastics, they contain things like BPA which are proven hormone disturbers, just a heads up
[5:45:36] sound_wayv: @Shoohk good, the world is too populated as it is
[5:45:43] Mikasa1337x: Nietzsche is an inspiration for nazi

[5:46:18] iknowido: did nietzsche have alot of kids are was he too busy?
[5:46:19] AintFinnaSubscribe: especially heated plastic is super bad, scientifically proven to fuck up hormones but still used in everything
[5:46:21] avoidedneXt: @Mikasa1337x Incorrect. His sister took his work and cherry picked it for the nazi movement
[5:46:21] AxelFromAustralia: stainless steel drinking containers are better than glass, glass erodes quicker leaving micro-silicates in your blood
[5:46:21] sound_wayv: @Shoohk lol no it doesnt
[5:46:23] rotbonewow: dude neitzche was the antithesis of what he pronounced. I still agree with his thinking tho
[5:46:28] bigwank69: dont drink out of plastic if you do youll be a femboy
[5:46:29] Shoohk: how so @sound_wayv
[5:46:35] theDill: i dont wear polyester the polymers can seep in through your sweat pores
[5:46:43] slachi: Microplastics come from fabric. If you are using polyester etc clothes your dryer is coated in microplastics
[5:46:54] Shoohk: you think every single first world country being wiped is going to keep the world alive and thriving?

[5:47:09] Dewzi: the rela one
[5:47:10] sound_wayv: @Shoohk theres over 8 billion people in the world, a slight decline in birthrate for the first time in millennia is negligible
[5:47:11] Dewzi: real
[5:47:19] gebecat: Questions if ive even read nietzsche and now says he doesnt care
[5:47:23] avoidedneXt: Nietzsche was not the ant-thesis of his on words. He basically said the unthinking, unlearning people who focus on nothing but being entertained with the scum of the world
[5:47:25] AintFinnaSubscribe: @slachi most exposure is by ingestion still

[5:49:32] lagginginironforge: ofc
[5:49:33] avoidedneXt: Yeah but for literally all of time it was considered normal to war wage, enslave your enemy and geocide its people
[5:49:34] Link9286: its selection
[5:49:35] embarrassm3nt: So you mean... nautral selection?
[5:49:39] Shoohk: @sound_wayv by that logic, not a single country should ever go into a depression or economic collapse
[5:49:46] therealzugzugzugs: it all adds up

[5:49:54] carlos_dang3r: it is time to outlaw the burning of coal, though BASEDCIGAR
[5:49:58] AxelFromAustralia: exactly, look at any mammal species it’s exactly the same, natural pressures push the stronger to survive, but with society saying “no even regards can breed” that’s bad for humanity

[5:50:48] sound_wayv: @Shoohk just look at china
[5:50:48] grunchies420: So you´re basicly talking about Idiocracy?
[5:50:49] AxelFromAustralia: low iq poor people who are ugly and retarted have 7+ kids where high iq individuals have 1-2 children
[5:50:50] OspreyRed: idiocracy is real YEP
[5:50:57] c00kieees: Nietzsche is a great philossopher and thinker. His sister was a nazi who used her dead brother's words to prove her believes to gain traction in the nationalist movement. He was a thinker who did not care about peoples genietics. His sister did thought.
[5:50:59] theDill: hasnt the lower class always had more kids
[5:51:00] lagginginironforge: idiocracy is a documentary

[5:52:06] AxelFromAustralia: the government supporting these welfare baby factory families is great because it keeps the population stupid and easy to enslave to keep the elite in power for generations to come
[5:52:13] Shoohk: @sound_wayv i just very encourage you to research it my friend. i dont wanna argue about it. i just ask you to educate yourself about it. in regards to china, they are on a brink of collapse due to their birth rates. almost 1/3 of their population will be dead in the next decade and no one to fill those positions
[5:52:14] nesbb: Do Shamans have WF on horde side? or is that still later levels?

[5:52:54] AintFinnaSubscribe: @StaysafeTV remember that story on inside edition yesterday? they just executed him with gas
[5:53:06] dtl78: i just cant wait for the pole flip
[5:53:08] kapparN: "low IQ" people are more ignorant, use less contraceptives while "higher IQ" people don't want to be stuck on a marriage, on a gold-digger scam, on a onlyfans bait girl and think long term relationships .. thus have less kids @StaysafeTV
[5:53:10] AxelFromAustralia: the government supporting these welfare baby factory families is great because it keeps the population stupid and easy to enslave to keep the elite in power for generations to come

[5:54:21] sound_wayv: @Shoohk my wife wrote her thesis on overpopulation and the affects low birthrate is having/will have in the near and not-so-distant future, not looking to argue just saying the doomer mentality about it is overblown, china is set to lose closer to ~9% btw, which is still ruff

[6:15:15] Vehicle_King: One Texan life is not worth any trouble. They are impeding federal govt.
[6:15:18] Hectabulah: no shot that gets close to happening

[6:18:08] A_L_A_S_K_A: ANYONE
[6:18:09] Shoohk: @arlaster block the access to the locations.
[6:18:16] chasegapo: current administration / government is no longer governing / looking out for the countries best interest.
[6:18:17] NutterCircus: The fact that someone can say that says things are about to go sideways.

[6:19:24] xxLucas: @theDill When isnt there one, TBH.
[6:19:24] Taicho116: @arlaster Texas has its own mini military. Biden cant use the normal military because posse comitatus stops that. This is why Trump couldn't send the military to stop BLM burnign down portland

[8:35:24] Vehicle_King: And I cant stand the man
[8:35:27] dr_cia_again: @numblezzz, that's common sense
[8:35:29] nyckcage: Georgia and documents case are looking super bad for him
[8:35:30] sothis666: I imagine the most they could do is put him under house arrest, since he has to be guarded by the secret service as former prez
[8:35:42] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader How do you know they are innocent? were you there?
[8:35:44] sothis666: what are they gonna do, put him in jail with a secret service escort?
[8:35:45] 5by_five: theres always a chance with our corrupt DoJ but highly doubtful. youd have riots across the country imo
[8:35:48] rocknsake: lmao, SoD Phase 2 + Trump's name cleared on the same day
[8:35:51] ocu2: no thats when p2 drops
[8:35:51] lagginginironforge: hes polling so well, they cannot even convict him of anything. Its would be a civil war
[8:35:54] DumbledorSoD: feb 8th is sod p2
[8:35:59] letsgoforsen123: They are postponing it because P2
[8:36:00] treyywow: trump will never go too a prison theres 0% chance

[8:36:11] fleesyo: did you watch the ben shapiro vs destiny debate
[8:36:22] A_L_A_S_K_A: it's nimrata's turn
[8:36:23] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV this retard daddysmelly actually believes the catholic church did nothing wrong in history and doesn't believe in witch burnings.
[8:36:26] Vehicle_King: Trump will just appeal appeal appeal, then die and never serve. Assuming hes every convicted (doubtful).
[8:36:28] rocknsake: it is February 8
[8:36:36] fleesyo: fair enough
[8:36:38] SolanarTV: jew v atheist LOL
[8:36:39] Knaldstiv: it was mid
[8:36:39] A_L_A_S_K_A: "debate"
[8:36:43] numblezzz: its crazy how much the integrity of the courts has degraded over the past 5-10 years
[8:36:45] tex_oce: cringe ass shit from those two
[8:36:45] reavethederp: there was alot of agreement
[8:36:51] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV yeah the "debate" was awful
[8:36:53] TurboBased: PogU the two most annoying voices on earth in one place
[8:36:54] A_L_A_S_K_A: two guys screaming about who loves israel more
[8:36:54] omawamousinda: is destiny a far left? i dont think so
[8:36:58] iBanEvader: @DaddySmelly how years of disproving the earth is round?
[8:37:00] scelero: @numblezzz watch Law Abiding Citizen.  fun watch
[8:37:03] Knaldstiv: alot of TDS too
[8:37:07] 5by_five: @omawamousinda i doubt it if a republican wins. prolly just more shrilling and shrieking from dems
[8:37:09] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader They were witches. They were found guilty of being witches which is why they were burned. You don't just get to overturn trials because you didnt like the outcome
[8:37:13] reavethederp: he was on his best behaviour
[8:37:14] tsetse2fly: he did
[8:37:16] Knaldstiv: YEP
[8:37:19] tex_oce: they both don't debate anyone talented
[8:37:21] Zaziben: very polite
[8:37:26] nyckcage: Hoarding classified documents like trump has done would get the average person sent away to federal prison immediately for many years
[8:37:35] iBanEvader: @DaddySmelly copernicus and galileo galilei who were the first scientists trying to prove the earth was round were being boycotted by the catholic church
[8:37:35] dustydollars2121: Have you seen the movie "infinite" with Marc Walberg? If not, I highly recommend it.
[8:37:37] omawamousinda: @5by_five wdym, so if dems win there will be violent protest or what?:D
[8:37:39] SolanarTV: @nyckcage ur gay tho
[8:37:41] jenrin: destiny kinda is civiled tho
[8:37:45] AintFinnaSubscribe: @StaysafeTV when biden won in 2020, he had an average 7 point lead in the polls, he ended up winning by 4. Now in 2024 Trump is leading by 4
[8:37:48] reavethederp: some topics they'd both say we cant acomplish anything here and skip the topic
[8:37:57] nyckcage: @SolanarTV You are delusional
[8:37:57] Bronloch: THE PROBLEM is they have imposed a false duality on our minds from childhood and thus control the parameters of our thoughts and solutions and the most basic level! SwiftRage
[8:38:01] Knaldstiv: @nyckcage every president does that
[8:38:08] bots_bots: @AintFinnaSubscribe dont trust the polls. they said hillary would win 2016
[8:38:09] nyckcage: @Knaldstiv Thats incorrect
[8:38:10] lagginginironforge: @AintFinnaSubscribe Implying it wasn't stolen

[8:38:10] SpoolyZ02: Interesting talks today, im out tho pce yall
[8:38:12] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV daddysmelly believes women/witches got justifyingly burned LUL
[8:38:27] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader Whats wrong with that? That happens all the time with new controversial topics. The catholic church defended it's position and relented once they found evidence to the contrary
[8:38:32] scelero: i hate polls.
[8:38:34] Vehicle_King: any poll today is worthless
[8:38:37] nyckcage: @SolanarTV At least I'm not a Troon like u
[8:38:38] numblezzz: 92% hillary victory btw
[8:38:49] scelero: 'we took a poll of 200 random people'.  haha
[8:38:51] Knaldstiv: @nyckcage oh really? biden hasnt done it?
[8:38:52] Bronloch: polls are faker than the news LUL
[8:39:00] SolanarTV: @nyckcage what does that even mean
[8:39:00] iBanEvader: @DaddySmelly how about trying to convert other people's relgions with violence?
[8:39:10] nyckcage: @Knaldstiv Nowhere near the extent that trump has
[8:39:10] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader BASED
[8:39:16] quackums: the polls said hillary wins 100%
[8:39:16] 5by_five: @omawamousinda with the same shenanigans as last time prlly
[8:39:17] Vehicle_King: saving grace for America is both candidates die of old age and we get some candidates with common sense running
[8:39:18] Sawfthandz: @StaysafeTV according to Siri/Alexa there is no election. It wont unfold.
[8:39:19] scelero: polls are for people who still you powerpoint.
[8:39:21] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader I wish they hadnt stopped
[8:39:22] iBanEvader: @DaddySmelly yea you're a troll, and you're not funny
[8:39:23] Knaldstiv: @nyckcage okay? whats your point?
[8:39:26] dr_cia_again: @SolanarTV, means you werea troop and servedin the army
[8:39:33] numblezzz: def happened in 2020
[8:39:33] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader ? Im a troll?
[8:39:35] A_L_A_S_K_A: spoiler texas secedes and trump rules as president from federal prison
[8:39:37] SolanarTV: @dr_cia_again lul
[8:39:45] clozer_kek: never sit at home
[8:39:46] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader so you quit this argument and you lose lmao. Weak. Time to leave chat
[8:39:48] numblezzz: PA def went blue cuz of lazy fucks in 2020
[8:39:51] bots_bots: "ah fuck i forgot my ID"
[8:39:54] plae007: and then they find 10 million mail ins for biden
[8:39:58] handovdoom666: lol you believe polls in 2024
[8:40:00] bigrick896: the pollsters have refined their methodology a lot since brexit / trump etc
[8:40:01] harvenius: I think the opposite is true. If your candidate is losing, you say fuck it
[8:40:03] rocknsake: yeah, hilary suffered because of polls
[8:40:06] bots_bots: @StaysafeTV check ur mailbox
[8:40:07] iBanEvader: @DaddySmelly I don't debate retards
[8:40:13] dr_cia_again: my 136 year old great grandpa also voted for biden somehow
[8:40:14] scelero: how come they can put a serial number on a dollar bill, but not a mail in ballot?
[8:40:26] harvenius: yo
[8:40:28] numblezzz: can we get some timeouts on this chat war, im getting 2nd hand retardation
[8:40:34] AintFinnaSubscribe: Polls can be analyzed if you take a margin of error into account and take the average result of them rather than a specific poll, stupid people misunderstand polls
[8:40:42] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader You dont debate period, you just spout anti catholic talking points in twitch chat like ???
[8:40:48] scelero: @numblezzz did someone say Thunderfury?
[8:40:49] A_L_A_S_K_A: lots of regards tonight

[8:41:07] AxelFromAustralia: help
[8:41:18] DaddySmelly: @iBanEvader and you have shown no evidence for ANY of your claims that the church burnt 'innocent' women
[8:41:24] handovdoom666: polls are answered by old people with landline phones. no one under the age of 30 answers a poll on their cell phone.
[8:41:40] dr_cia_again: whoever wins the election, it can get stolen again, one thing is always certain. americans won't do shit about anything
[8:41:47] scelero: @Vehicle_King i knew voting was a scam my 5th grade year and our class president didnt get us pizza for lunch everyday.
[8:41:49] shadotdow: yo
[8:41:57] shadotdow: hello staysafe

[9:25:16] only499atkfc: In all seriousness, the best diet is the one that works for you. if OMAD works for you and feels good, then do it. There's no META diet, if someone says there's a meta diet, they're full of shit
[9:25:19] curwin69: actual medical issues aside, the only ppl who disagree with OMAD are just too chicken to try it
[9:25:20] A_L_A_S_K_A: he also takes like 90 horse pills a day
[9:25:21] SpoolyZ02: people think they need to eat more than they really do

[10:12:42] rollo4yolo: Coffee the only drug you need!
[10:12:43] pwnoknox: was on klonopin for 17 years, prescribed. Got off cold turkey and it was the hardest thing i ever had to do. Had to relearn to walk correctly. Was horrible.
[10:12:48] dustydollars2121: how much alcohol does one have to drink to get dependent enough to die from withdrawal?
[10:12:49] harvenius: whenever you're craving ketamine, just instead have a head of broccoli
[10:12:52] uzisd4: I had to try every drug once to make sure they were bad , can confirm

[10:14:31] andyjamesgames: talk therapy works well for me. im lucky enough to have friends and family to talk to
[10:14:33] rollo4yolo: Before you diagnose yourself with low self esteem- addictive personality, trauma w/e. ask yourself if you exercise eat healthy, have good social relations!
[10:14:36] kingofkings144: Lifestyle is subjective. You need to 360 your view on life

[10:15:04] sargent_baddy: @NooleanB feels that way for sure
[10:15:07] scelero: ive fallen off the wagon a lot.
[10:15:25] andyjamesgames: when you learn about talk therapy you start to recognize it in your daily life - people just start rambling on talking to me about shit, they just need to get some shit off their chest ya know
[10:15:30] NooleanB: @sargent_baddy Medical device failure analysis / reliability....   basically being critical constantly

[10:17:06] theDill: is it an insecurity
[10:17:08] rollo4yolo: im a psychologist xD

[10:19:32] Sawfthandz: I felt like I had 10 people in my head
[10:19:38] Sawfthandz: all talking simultaneously
[10:19:41] rsSilence: I don't doubt therapy helps with genuinely major issues, genuine PTSD for instance, but I think it's pushed very heavily towards people that don't really need it, just like with many other kinds of medicine
[10:19:49] scelero: @Sawfthandz he said he was away but physically a zombie and couldnt move or want to
[10:20:08] Denz0TV: Mental illness is very real, but it's a symptom of modern day living. Humans should be in small tribes hunting and gathering, not connected to millions of other via the internet with so much stimulation
[10:20:21] scelero: Do you think playing WoW is a vice?
[10:20:21] Marnikx: remember from the dsm3 to dsm4 therapist decided being gay wasnt a illness anymore

[10:22:57] sargent_baddy: Never even made an account on a dating app been with my girl for 6 years now since high school but I sure do love weed

[11:11:01] macbell21: @StaysafeTV alles gut?
[11:11:02] Taicho116: You get a tax credit for taxes paid.

[11:11:18] story_writer_rent: murrica
[11:11:26] dustydollars2121: 18 still too high
[11:11:27] gr33nsurfer: all my friends who had american passport gave it back so they do not have to pay those taxes xD
[11:11:31] Knaldstiv: HUH 18?
[11:11:35] wraige10: I am german as well live in canada though
[11:11:39] Zinaroth: WHy would you pay taxes in US if you live and work in Germany? What kind of fucked up taxation is that? I am from Denmark and we have the highest income tax in EU and that is wild to me.
[11:11:47] purplepoodle89: germany has basic human healthcare though? so you wouldn't need health insurance
[11:11:50] darkbringerrgw2: That is brutal
[11:12:11] purplepoodle89: you also get 3 months of a nanny
[11:12:14] MessyZerg: is germany where germs live?
[11:12:15] LabraDuck: uk is worse, over 50% and we still have private health and eyeing security too

[11:12:24] ezentricks: thats fucked
[11:12:25] numblezzz: european socialism Pog
[11:12:26] rehlytcranston: Yes that's true. Private insurance here for freelancers, I did that for a while
[11:12:32] Zinaroth: You don't need private health care though? Everyone has access to public.
[11:12:33] story_writer_rent: what if you stayed in Germany for a good part of the year as a guest in someone elses house?
[11:12:48] motimotions: Self employed health care is cheap tho compared to USA in every country xD
[11:12:53] sigilfish: does she own mcdonalds?
[11:13:13] darkbringerrgw2: Sounds like you ahve to do that

[11:13:15] sigilfish: how long is the flight from portland to germany? monkaHmm
[11:13:23] tex_oce: need stability
[11:13:25] Totalko: Only 18% tax. We pay 37.3% or 49.5%
[11:13:27] rehlytcranston: Self employed health insurance is cheap in Germany, true. But it also accounts you and your partner's income into how much you pay (speaking from experience(
[11:13:32] darkbringerrgw2: Oh I mean if you wanted to visit Germany
[11:13:33] story_writer_rent: true i cant even fathom how to do that especially once kids have to go to school
[11:13:42] lagginginironforge: @Totalko Spotted the Canuck
[11:13:52] Zargeras0: streans over?
[11:13:57] Goatluver92: you do get fully free healthcare in Norway though, and theres a "freecard" on medicine and chiropractor treatments etc after 300Dollars Aproxx
[11:14:00] sigilfish: imagine not paying 54% income tax KEKL
[11:14:01] Zinaroth: @story_writer_rent People who do that, do so at the cost of their childrens well being.
[11:14:03] Goatluver92: if you are terminal its all free
[11:14:10] purplepoodle89: 3 months of a nanny  might cost more than the 11% difference
[11:14:21] Enizebtw: In Sweden you can literally do nothing and have full access to heathcare.
[11:14:30] Knaldstiv: 50+
[11:14:32] sillynix: 40~~
[11:14:39] Goatluver92: i pay 33% on a 75k dollar a year salary
[11:14:41] sigilfish: KEKL

[11:15:01] Taicho116: @sigilfish like 9-11 hours you can't fly strait from portland that i know of Denver/LAX is what I see most maybe Seattle
[11:15:07] dustydollars2121: 40-50% taxes.... you guys need a boston tea party
[11:15:16] gr33nsurfer: if you are german and have a job it is pretty easy to live in switzerland, gues it will be the same for norway
[11:15:17] wascii: thats insane
[11:15:19] sigilfish: isnt it insane hard to immigrate to switzerland
[11:15:21] lagginginironforge: STILL CHEAPER THAN TAXES
[11:15:22] motimotions: Thats insane
[11:15:26] darkbringerrgw2: Sounds about right
[11:15:26] tex_oce: yikes what  ascam
[11:15:28] Knaldstiv: not bad
[11:15:31] sigilfish: @Taicho116 that sounds absolute ass
[11:15:33] calybroon: American health care is dumb
[11:15:38] Zinaroth: Thta is way more than I pay in taxes for free health care.
[11:15:39] Matdaug: YEP
[11:15:41] lagginginironforge: And much better serivce.
[11:15:43] tripledistance: if you go to hospital do you pay ontop of that?
[11:15:43] purplepoodle89: just don't pay it and don't get sick, that's what i do
[11:15:47] wascii: does that factor out of pocket
[11:15:47] motimotions: Probably isnt tho
[11:15:54] harvenius: USA is op
[11:15:57] janck77: Swede here. Please delete the idea from your brain that healthcare is "free". We pay big bucks for taxes (54% personally, stockholm). Never ever used doc, don't have kids, my parents live in central eu (not sweden), and I pay for my public transport :clown:.
[11:16:06] MrPink604: not even account for how much energy you must use
[11:16:19] darkbringerrgw2: Honestly not bad for four people
[11:16:33] captaintoadi88: pay about the same in the swedish capital but i live alone
[11:16:36] wascii: luckily i dont have kids so i can go without health insurance and just die :)
[11:16:42] dustydollars2121: If your country is taxing you more than 30% its time to think about a revolt... your government is robbing you blind
[11:16:46] calybroon: Sounds like u need to move to aussie mate
[11:16:49] weebyweeb24: aight so what is ur phase 2 PREP
[11:16:52] lagginginironforge: Someone get me a greencard, jfc.

[11:17:47] darkbringerrgw2: A lot of factors
[11:17:51] Sea_of_Vodka: texas desert???
[11:17:55] Enizebtw: Yeah taxes but if you anytime in the future can't work or you have to take care of your children/old parents you get so much more help.
[11:18:03] cuelii: who would willingly live in texas anyway
[11:18:03] story_writer_rent: plus every winter is a toss up if you survive the freezing cold once the power grid goes down in texas
[11:18:13] ReconMazihoFanda: Imagine living in California with 0 tax
[11:18:14] sigilfish: Texas is just California DLC
[11:18:14] dustydollars2121: @janck77 USA inc?
[11:18:25] dustydollars2121: @lagginginironforge where are you at?
[11:18:28] DaddySmelly: I do not appreaciate them
[11:18:34] wascii: thing with EU taxes and healthcare is that everyone is paying it. if everyone is poorer no one is worse for wear typically
