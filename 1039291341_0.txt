[0:11:51] I_DoctorSatan_I: PRANCE FORWARD
[0:12:04] pisceslonewolf: @TCGRebel - Not blaming the mods. But the notification is manual. Most streamers forget about it so they set it to something generic.
[0:12:09] I_DoctorSatan_I: SHIMMY RIGHT
[0:12:09] Sir_Matticus: DOUBLE BOOGIE DOWN!
[0:12:59] TCGRebel: @pisceslonewolf yes people can set it, but TWITCH and the MOBILE device you use are different factors
[0:13:04] pisceslonewolf: It's not that I was notified. It's the content of the notification message. Not even complaining, just pointing it out.

[1:12:13] Zandaloriann: safest meta class is a druid, atleast one of them is uber meta :D
[1:12:18] SerMitten: I'm just happy this is on twitch instead of youtube
[1:12:26] Kreathak: people still jump on the very obvious bait...
[1:12:35] SeathVII: 5% dmg maybe worth
[1:12:43] Leninay: I don't enyjoy watching this tournament, so I spend all my time complaining about it in twitch chat, real 5Head here
[1:12:48] alzaca420: @thetacorogue there is not meta stop complaing abotu things that are nto even happening in this tournament
[1:12:57] emnitthy: This is the absolute highest content in the game that is doable atm, OFC every team will run the absolute best min maxed classes
[1:13:19] aelaren64: @thetacorogue people are competing for money, why you upset at them for using the same classes???
[1:13:24] AutumnWinds7: @Insanity7  yeah complaining that only 20% of specs are playable at high lvl is such weird thing to do...
[1:13:30] sudheer_killer: @alzaca420  Do you see different comps? KEKW KEKW
[1:13:39] Jjmn12: too many people playing ele shaman, the spec that wasn't played by anyone for 3 years BabyRage
[1:13:42] a_sl1me: thats like complaining that there are only 4 melee in the RWF
[1:13:56] alzaca420: @sudheer_killer bro they are changing comps for every dungeon they go into
[1:13:57] emnitthy: @wwinter7 that is indeed wrong, all specs are playable at high level, this is not high elvel, this is competitive, which is MUCH different
[1:14:14] NateYoungTV: @wwinter7 plenty of other specs are playable at a high level, just not the absolute peak highest level where an extra 1 to 2 percent matters
[1:14:15] sudheer_killer: @alzaca420 Ye i know
[1:14:21] doubleshinetv: Chat why can't blizz just balance all 36 specs for 3 different forms of content
[1:14:22] violentlyhappy1: echo going for dos 25 nice
[1:14:22] alzaca420: yall are not watching enough if you think they have been on this comp the entire time
[1:14:25] sudheer_killer: Just messin with chat KEKW
[1:14:31] SerMitten: Pushing 26s in a tournament is the best time to test your survival hunter deeps. If not now, when?!
[1:14:32] Jimmy_Mou: This 4 screen view point is really bad don't you think?
[1:14:38] bosse_brun: Why are people mad about not every single class being played? i mean its literally impossible, if a class is .5% better than anorher, its gonna be played
[1:14:50] ab77778: @wwinter7 it is. at the absolute highest level of any game ever nothing is balanced. if you're not doing 25's/26's it doesnt matter.  and youre not, so play whatever you want
[1:14:53] alzaca420: @SerMitten eww melee in shadowlands
[1:15:01] adrianqt: Yeah I'm waiting for the surv hunter/ arcane mage/ enh shaman comp tbh
[1:15:02] melodieous: @jimmy_mou i like it
[1:15:04] Sakue20: @Jimmy_Mou put this stream on a second and watch one of the POV streams

[1:15:07] Holidayskin: !leaderboard
[1:15:08] alzaca420: there is way to much stuff to run out of and avoid in shadowlands for melee

[1:15:14] The1Bread: pls stop the discussion about meta. Just enjoy the stream, this topic is so exhausting just like the cry babies for conduit power
[1:15:17] doubleshinetv: If you look across Arena/Raiding/M+ almost every spec is doing okay and has a place
[1:15:18] Kashaww: If you have a huge monitor the 4 screen view isn't bad

[1:15:54] alzaca420: @The1Bread litteraly no one has ever capped out on the energys i don't know how this is a problem. i have 8 level 60's never ran out of energy once
[1:15:54] reyntime4: Thats us PogChamp
[1:15:55] Neyphilia: rooVV
[1:15:58] SerMitten: @adrianqt now that's a PogChamp comp, you can tank with earth elemental too so you can have one additional dps class, maybe sub rogue
[1:15:59] adrianqt: Conduit energy is the only reason I play the game
[1:16:00] kowaikoro: ele single target LUL
[1:16:01] AutumnWinds7: i was being sarcastic ofc, but healer balance is clearly way out of hand... on high level almost nothing can compete with pala
[1:16:02] doubleshinetv: @sudheer_killer aff was god tier in raiding
[1:16:03] sorli_: TWITCH CHAT 5Head
[1:16:05] vargpappans: Kek

[1:16:27] mayheart_: who are the casters?
[1:16:29] alzaca420: healer balence is the worst it has ever been for sure only shamans and paladins feel even playable dare i say
[1:16:31] Kahlandra: !casters
[1:16:31] Moobot: @Kahlandra Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge
[1:16:31] The1Bread: @double_shine  im not saying that its good or not. im just saying that the discussion around those topics are dead horses.
[1:16:34] Deathora: What is the great push?
[1:16:35] sudheer_killer: @double_shine We're talking about m+
[1:16:35] Moobot: Find out more about the Great Push including tournament format in the viewer's guide: http://blizz.ly/TGPViewersGuide
[1:16:39] emnitthy: The reason on high lvl nothing compares with apaldins is because paladins do the most dmg across the board, they arent the best healers
[1:16:43] adrianqt: @SerMitten With dps classes like those do you really need a 4th dps tho? :)
[1:17:01] joemchill: go pala healer
[1:17:03] Adonna55: @mayheart_ right now its Dratnos and Xy
[1:17:03] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge
[1:17:05] mopz_tv: how does the score system work anyways
[1:17:08] doubleshinetv: @sudheer_killer Yeah and i'm saying across all 3 forms of content the blaance isn't that bad. It's just impossible to  balance 36 specs across all that
[1:17:09] alzaca420: @emnitthy but further down there is a problem with 3 of the other healers justy not doing enough hps or damage
[1:17:11] SerMitten: Fax no printer
[1:17:17] richtea1978: What is that in dog score?
[1:17:18] mayheart_: @Adonna55 thanks!
[1:17:19] blardoh: @double_shine Hunters are kinda in a sad state. Not even middle of raid dps, 1 top arena team played hunter, and no one cares for hunters in high keys
[1:17:40] Adonna55: @mayheart_ yw dratnos loves the puns and jokes
[1:17:41] emnitthy: Never said the game is absolutely 100% balanced, BUT you can take any class to a +20 and that is undeniable
[1:17:42] doubleshinetv: @blardoh That's true but they were very strong in WF race
[1:17:49] mikkeal0: buff hunter BibleThump

[1:17:57] bosse_brun: Hunter are probably the worst class
[1:18:01] laedrixxx: isn't Hippo's dmg very low?
[1:18:18] Kalieyn: hippo is a big dmg gamer
[1:18:21] Maarlee: lmao
[1:18:37] vanqxo: hippo low dmg :(
[1:18:40] alzaca420: @bosse_brun i beat mages on my hunter what u talking about
[1:18:59] Trodenskjold: Hippo losing to ele and fire in aoe, he most be mad LUL
[1:19:05] Mytholxgy: @vanqxo :(
[1:19:07] richtea1978: How come Canexx isn‚Äôt in Sheesh? Wasn‚Äôt he in Andybrews team before?
[1:19:32] ConcernedGaming: @alzaca420 'cause you play with bad mages..... Or because Mage strength in Tournament setting is that they plan their pulls around the mages Combust
[1:19:34] alzaca420: @bosse_brun hunters pump and have great utility i would not count them out from being the best dps ifd they get the bow
[1:19:40] Constantx1: B-big deiner, have a feeling that wasn't the word he was looking for
[1:19:45] jundarer: Wegs
[1:19:49] bosse_brun: @alzaca420 oh so youre saying hunter are better than mages? Obviously thats not the case, im happy youre doing well but im just saying what is true
[1:19:56] laedrixxx: Moonkins lack aoe dmg, dear Blizz, bring back Hurricane. and make it like flamestrike, not full time channeling

[1:20:27] alzaca420: @bosse_brun just saying people act like hunters are garbage tier when one can easily out dps a mage
[1:20:27] mikkeal0: Do Mages have a target cap on aoe?
[1:20:30] mikotherogue: forgot that existed
[1:20:41] Livvii_Stargazer: I miss hurricane rip
[1:20:46] Bjartuur: What is a target cap?

[1:21:02] popCatter: on ignite
[1:21:05] ab77778: no hunter is doing more damage than good fire mage rn.
[1:21:08] cpmd4: fire mage doesnt really have a cap
[1:21:10] NateYoungTV: @Mikkkeal fire mages do not, frost does iirc from the fragments legendary
[1:21:11] mikotherogue: ignite has a cap
[1:21:13] popCatter: not on flamestrike, ignite has 8
[1:21:16] Livvii_Stargazer: Oh @laedrixxx you‚Äôre making me all nostalgic

[1:22:52] mikkeal0: Hunters are 5 target capped, unsure about survival. So imagine that contributes to our lower use atm
[1:22:56] alzaca420: @bosse_brun 50 people maybe 100
[1:22:56] 0mmurg: @radixtree Yeah this system does create some weird gaps that arent actually gaps
[1:23:30] richtea1978: Just target cap mages
[1:23:32] Larocca_88: they should display average key level so it's normalized by how many keys you've done

[1:24:52] playrrtwoo: let go echooo, you got this :)
[1:24:58] reyntime4: i like this format more than MDI
[1:25:03] zisions: elem sham op?
[1:25:07] GrimShady99: who is jp cone trick
[1:25:12] adrianqt: They're just good when you pull around them, which you have to if you want to time high keys. Which is why all the classes people are playing are uncapped. Target cap tyranny
[1:25:18] SIXFIVEGaming: dragon's breathe is like the most OP spell for M+
[1:25:19] Yager05: @emnitthy The problem is, that almost nobody can even be close to that effectiveness even if they pull BIIIIIG, coz' they are all caped...
[1:25:20] itaymesa: @Mikkkeal i blive he just says mage cos some mage is allways good

[1:25:52] Salimash: @shivengank Explain why this is better than MDI?
[1:26:14] playrrtwoo: the great push > MDI
[1:26:26] naughtdread: cause 18 keys are too easy for great teams with perfect gear

[1:26:40] Moobot: Follow the standings along with Raider.IO: http://rio.gg/greatpushleaderblz
[1:26:41] alzaca420: @Salimash they don't have to rush and we get to see how we could even improve our runs without seeing it done once.
[1:26:44] emnitthy: @Yager05 but that doesnt matter, cause only 100/150 people per server WILL get to that level, the game isnt balanced around the top 0.01%
[1:26:50] NateYoungTV: @shivengank because it's more representative of live keys, no one is repeatedly speedrunning to 3 chest +18s on live, they're pushing levels up
[1:27:03] jansonwow: @ArrgTV yo wassup
[1:27:12] shivengank: @Salimash Teams that normally push RIO are present, higher keys, focus on completion not just speed running

[1:28:06] NateYoungTV: @TheSeanGill yumytvCozy
[1:28:11] OortCloudBig: speedrunning 18s for MDI is like having limit and echo speedrun nyalotha, it means nothing
[1:28:29] alzaca420: @0mmurg idk try and google it
[1:28:32] Yager05: @emnitthy Just coz' only 100 ppl play at 25-30 level doesn't mean that the target ca doesn't effect everyone else. This mindset is so dumb. Even I, a pleb outlaw in 17s/18s feel it when mages just leave me in the dust...

[1:30:04] muyuu: @Cozy_heart nope
[1:30:10] Yager05: @TheDadBodGod Meta? hmm, maybe. Fire mage STILL does double or triple dmg...
[1:30:14] OortCloudBig: @Yager05 outlaws arent taken into high keys for dps output, you're confusing your role
[1:30:18] alzaca420: @0mmurg yeah google seems hard to find what you want after 2020
[1:30:21] livv2115: SHEEEESH
[1:30:22] meuse420: sheeeeeeeeesh
[1:30:45] TheDadBodGod: @yager05 an outlaw rogue literally has the *** score in the game and the highest keys timed. They‚Äôre meta
[1:30:47] emnitthy: @Yager05 sir, perfect balance doesnt exist, its hard to freaking balance 12 classes and 36 specs, every class CAN and HAS timed 20s, 24/25 is top end content that requires even 5% differences taken into account
[1:30:49] davy_: sheeeeeeeeeesh wildigEZ
[1:30:49] TrippyvV: SHEEEEEEEEEESHJ
[1:30:58] shivengank: To be able to see MDI teams face against a RIO #1/2 is for me the highlight but yes the higher keys and emphasis on not just speed running is awesome

[1:31:04] Kalieyn: SHEEEESH
[1:31:14] Adekin: It's a shame this stream isn't 4k ;-)
[1:31:14] Yager05: @OortCloudBig Either target cap everyone or noone. That's not the solution
[1:31:15] Necrosystv: Wait did Blizzard's contract end with YouTube?
[1:31:19] adrianqt: Yeah outlaw is definitely meta, but they are there for control not dam :)
[1:31:28] Xyronic: I haven‚Äôt liked Xyronic in ages. He always overreacts to chat and acts like he‚Äôs better than everyone. He lacks humility, tact, or grace. He‚Äôs just a cocky keyboard warrior.
[1:31:31] playrrtwoo: letS go teams.. you can do itttttt!!!!
[1:31:40] TheDadBodGod: @yager05 if you didn‚Äôt know that outlaw is meta in keys, you shouldn‚Äôt be talking about balance in keys

[1:31:44] OortCloudBig: @Yager05 thats a bad take, outlaw brings shroud skips which are pretty much essential
[1:31:46] Arkarku: @Necrosystv no, this isnt actual MDI so it can be on twitch
[1:31:47] mikotherogue: yeah high keys way more entertaining than speed running... watch mdi to see pepega wipes on huge pulls

[1:32:16] hyperionai: how many attempts at each key do they get? is it infinite?
[1:32:26] emnitthy: @Yager05 its A solution, not the best, but the reason why youre being put to dust by other classes is probably more to do about your lack of skill
[1:32:33] Belirs: @morriganwow infinite it doesnt go down in key lvl
[1:32:36] Necrosystv: @The_Red__Queen ah thank you! I was like dang that bigs news lol
[1:32:37] Kahlandra: they can try as many times as they want, but they are limited to 15 total hours for everything
[1:32:39] muyuu: @meuse420 idk, seems impossible to time these keys without their dps
[1:32:42] Faraday5001: @morriganwow keys dont deplete
[1:32:45] nchester51: yeah i think they are only limited by time like 5 hours a day
[1:32:49] muyuu: other healers dont even do half their dmg
[1:32:55] Kahlandra: have to decide if you want to keep pushing one high key or grab several lower keys
[1:32:58] alzaca420: @meuse420 yeah i think a shaman with earth ele lego could do enough dps but just way more hps

[1:39:35] adrianqt: Ele sham has been insane since their buffs a while ago. Just no one plays them so they never get nerfed
[1:39:36] Unholytree: @bonjwaianer Bear tabky always, shaman tanky since a 9.0.5 or their first leggo

[1:42:29] emnitthy: Right now Holy paladins are the healers with the most dps, if it was resto druid that's what everyone would play, class balance has nothing to do with what classes are picked
[1:42:29] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge

[1:43:10] cpmd4: revert survival to ranged spec, don't @ me
[1:43:13] ayohae: skyline would have 1 phased ingra with arcane
[1:43:29] meuse420: @cpmd4 agreed
[1:43:32] alzaca420: @cpmd4 no make it a tank with a pet helper
[1:43:34] Kelthiz: @cpmd4 I will @ you and I agree. Kinda miss black arrow survival
[1:43:40] meuse420: hard agree
[1:43:50] alzaca420: dude survival hunter tank with a pet helper would be so cool
[1:43:51] Dwn003: @duekov Be careful, yesterday I got banned from chat for 7 minutes for giving an opinion.
[1:44:00] Coachhx: i don't understand how these guys mess up pride skips so much

[1:44:31] TheDadBodGod: @dwn003 I‚Äôm sure your opinion was of great substance
[1:44:31] emnitthy: @dwn003 you were probably being toxic dude
[1:44:36] derTikimann: @naguura @Psybearslat i disagree. this time pressure also exists on live keys. The 5 hours before server resets. LUL
[1:44:46] meuse420: they mess up prides because hpala doesnt heal for at all
[1:44:47] omezy23: Skyline numba wun
[1:44:49] wogcog: why does jpc wanna jmy so bad
[1:44:50] Duekov: I guess I‚Äôd just like to see some more commentary on what‚Äôs going on in the dungeon
[1:44:52] Kahlandra: opinions are always allowed as long as they aren't rude
[1:44:52] alzaca420: i think they need to be focusing on turning these specs like arcane and survival and demonlogy into usefull specs like tanks or healers
[1:44:53] alandiamond12: Nagurra... say what you are really want to say.  Every one but Echo is at a disadvantage to you.
[1:45:03] tharawow: kinda sad how treant colldown isnt tracked, imo a very crucial CD for pulls
[1:45:04] Dwn003: @emnitthy I literally just said I didn‚Äôt like how X person casted.

[1:45:34] SilverDragon53: @rofliexd the best of the best at survival. Even if the top MM went surv for a key... he would be bad
[1:45:37] Shacalicious_: @Kahlandra ?
[1:45:40] Arilin: the big red thing is called "healthbar"
[1:45:45] anthr4zit: What happened to the youtube exclusive streaming?
[1:45:47] Exolz: What is the best hunter spec in pve atm?
[1:45:50] Kahlandra: @Funky_Chemist if we can't tell its sarcastic probably not
[1:45:53] emnitthy: @dwn003 hardly an opinion, a direct attack to a caster, why would you think others in chat should read your rants ?
[1:45:55] Lijan: !standings
[1:45:55] Dwn003: @duekov I agree with you, there‚Äôs too much talk on the fan base of Echo and Ambition lol.

[1:46:06] periperus: "quite far down the leaderboard" ????

[1:46:13] cpmd4: this event is not part of the YT contract

[1:47:19] Xyronic: Pog
[1:47:20] Thoreya: they shud go all out and give us a new ranged class/4th spec for all classes for 10.0. some cool stuff to spicen up the game a lil. it needs it
[1:47:30] alzaca420: @hateandchaos whats monsterhunterworld
[1:47:30] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge

[1:47:48] logarthz1: the best tact would be doing all 24s first
[1:47:50] alzaca420: @Thoreya im still waiting on a healer hero class
[1:47:51] NateYoungTV: no its me :)
[1:48:00] TrippyvV: yes, more ranged specs to overshadow the few melee that are left in meta @Thoreya LUL
[1:48:04] NWTFIsJuice: @Thoreya druid 5th spec confirmed
[1:48:07] johnsmthh: @DaniBoo_18
[1:48:17] emnitthy: @rofliexd not every spec is optimal for every content, it‚Äôs unthinkable to balance 36 specs over 3 types of content
[1:48:21] spencelul: i remember when everyone was memeing ambition for spending so long in mists now look at skyline and dtbs
[1:48:25] Thoreya: @trippyxgodx melee specs are already bloated
[1:48:31] adrianqt: @Psybearslat Imagine not having 5 accounts logged into tourny realm with all the characters you're going to play set up :)
[1:48:34] vuzelol: is that psybear?

[1:48:48] Xyronic: :)
[1:48:50] MechNL: @vuzelli yes
[1:48:52] TrippyvV: @Thoreya well atm they dont have much representation
[1:48:58] Belirs: ECH OH NO
[1:49:04] rofliexd: @emnitthy of course, but survival is dead because it has little to no playerbase (due to mm being plain better and all good players moving onto it)
[1:49:12] Esotraz: was it cause of caster curse?
[1:49:52] nero_hots: @Xyronic so time for the teams to do some high keys Kappa
[1:50:02] emnitthy: @rofliexd just like arcane is dead, feral barely hanging on, many specs are good but suffer from having a better spec on the same class, since every spec can do 20s, game balance in fine imho
[1:50:19] BelongToFate: race toworld first 30 LUL oh wait... too hard
[1:50:31] alzaca420: Just nerf mad paragon lego it theortically mages your wings last forever easy nerf
[1:50:35] Daemonsbane: jakbTHINK  Is this a podcast, or will the actual runs in progress merit attention?
[1:50:42] Shacalicious_: @BelongToFate 30 has already been timed :>

[1:51:28] TheDadBodGod: Refresh if lag
[1:51:36] Dwn003: @Funky_Chemist I mean, it was timed in the tournament realm by using an exploit already patched so, that's that.
[1:51:43] Shacalicious_: @BrotherDanTV just me or is Psy talking waaaaaaay slower than when he normally streams? it makes sense tho

[1:52:22] rofliexd: @emnitthy and they are dead because no good player plays them because there are better alternatives
[1:52:25] MarkieMark80: Hi guys. Can someone explain to me what The Great Push is? (just got here)

[1:53:07] Livvii_Stargazer: Lol
[1:53:10] McNugget32: humour
[1:53:22] Dwn003: @Funky_Chemist Yah, they probably had in mind to be able to clear an entire 30+ key by exploding over and over the same mob.
[1:53:30] SixtyBizzy: I have to sub to toms inactive stream to get the emotes back KEKW @BizBichou
[1:53:38] Dwn003: without it dying lol
[1:53:42] ArrgTV: soon they will start bolstering the plagueborers in Plaguefall xD
[1:53:53] rofliexd: @emnitthy it matters for 27-29, i think every class could time up to 26 if good players actually gave it a chance
[1:53:59] mmrtbang: skyline is streaming on twich?
[1:54:11] BizBichou: @MEXout yes you dooo wildigKEK

[1:54:20] shinwtv: where can i see the leaderboard?
[1:54:22] alex_tha_man: @Dwn003 MCing the add to explode the add multiple is an exploit that is why it was fixed
[1:54:26] adrianqt: @rofliexd Only if every class ran with a fire mage boomie :)
[1:54:28] Shacalicious_: @Dwn003 they SPECIFICALLY designed the adds to interact with other mobs that way. either way its not an exploit. if the adds werent meant to damage other adds, then it would be an exploit

[1:57:00] adrianqt: @rofliexd I mean WW is probably the highest damage melee and it buffs Ele sham EQ etc. WW =/= bringing like a surv hunter or something :P

[1:57:55] meuse420: GROM NO
[1:58:00] Dwn003: @rofliexd Yah, gave it a chance after he recieved an insane buff...
[1:58:06] adrianqt: People started playing ele when it got buffed like 2 months ago
[1:58:12] DaniBoo_18: @johnsmthh hiii
[1:58:13] Senen_: Clearly a wipe caused by Growl, and nothing else Kappa
[1:58:15] noskaa_: @wadycesar its not like they stream themselfes so you can see the route
[1:58:17] emnitthy: @rofliexd honestly not sure what your point is
[1:58:21] adrianqt: also it's uncapped surv isn't
[1:58:22] muyuu: bear team Sadge

[1:58:30] itaymesa: @Senen_ pepehands
[1:58:44] rofliexd: @emnitthy the fact that every spec can be competitive if given the chance
[1:58:58] Senen_: @pseudo_nathan I'm sad we didn't see it on restream tbh
[1:59:10] rofliexd: @Dwn003 earthquake was broken before the buff and everyone slept on ele
[1:59:19] emnitthy: @rofliexd well I guess we agree , I thought you were raving about balance
[1:59:28] Yasu_sc2: They were disgusted by their timer and wanted to go again Kappa

[1:59:42] Belirs: oof
[1:59:47] Dwn003: @Funky_Chemist "Make use of (a situation) in a way considered unfair or underhand." Literal definition of exploit btw.
[1:59:48] TCGRebel: @rofliexd shhhh dont give away secrets!! people dont want to test it for themselves, they want everyone do it for them

[2:00:01] Convis88: Whats going on here? "The great push"
[2:00:03] rofliexd: @emnitthy im raving about people whining about bad specs when they werent given a chance to shine by minmaxers who play safe strong picks
[2:00:14] imaginist: zzzzzzzzz
[2:00:16] Alyriin: its not the number 1 seed, its just being in first place lol
[2:00:40] johnsmthh: @DaniBoo_18 Helloo <3
[2:00:48] adrianqt: @rofliexd Look no one is arguing that probably literally everything could do at least 24's or so. Once you start getting higher than that though you need uncapped dam or you ain't making dps checks.
[2:00:51] emnitthy: @rofliexd tbh many specs offer too much utility to not bring, like off healing or survivability
[2:01:06] KiloEagle: How come they only have to do 6/8 dungeons?
[2:01:08] lnglouis: whos the overall favorite to win this? skyline/echo?
[2:01:26] lnglouis: they did the other 2 during proving grounds qualifiers
[2:01:26] kali00s: echo
[2:01:26] techzz_: the other 2 dungeons was in the qualifier
[2:01:27] Senen_: @KiloEagle The other two were used for qualifiers
[2:01:29] JG120: skylines tank dced :(
[2:01:31] adrianqt: Also you could never bring 3 of those classes, look at every high rio off meta spec. The rest of their group is always insanely meta
[2:01:41] Duekov: They did SoA and NW for the qualifiers to be in this
[2:01:41] Dwn003: @Funky_Chemist Just google the definition of exploit or open a dictionary man. Your replies are liek saying Water is not H20
[2:01:45] Tuuba: why would they skip if the benefit outweighs the resources used on it?
[2:01:48] grimley_: fan favorite? probably echo; but it's really close... I want andy's team to win so bad
[2:01:54] Kahlandra: @Dwn003 enough
[2:01:54] ab77778: @Funky_Chemist if blizzard didnt think it was an exploit they wouldnt have touched it. ofcourse its an exploit.
[2:02:01] KiloEagle: @KiloEagle ahh i see, ty!
[2:02:01] rofliexd: @adrianqt some people here were arguing tho that "best players on dead spec x cant do +24 in time" (because surprise, if echo players rolled them they would)
[2:02:03] Senen_: @lnglouis Depends on who you ask. Skyline was top seed on qualifiers. Echo is Echo. Ambition is the top team on live servers.
[2:02:08] Deladox: What is the dots below the key level? Are you only allowed 2 dungeon restarts?
[2:02:16] emnitthy: @tuuba time, they can‚Äôt kill every pride cause it takes too much time
[2:02:28] TrippyvV: SHEEESH
[2:02:28] Moobot: Broadcast starts Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 10am Pacific / 7pm CEST. Players have 5 hours each day to push the dungeons.

[2:02:44] Tuuba: emnitthy yeah but if the benefit outweighs the time spent on it?
[2:02:58] Deladox: Ahh ty @jg120
[2:03:03] noxlr: LUL 4 of them flyed off the edge KEKW
[2:03:05] boardinfreak: Yes

[2:03:17] Vendethtv: Skyline tank dced
[2:03:18] emnitthy: @tuuba they don‚Äôt skip all of them, sometimes the benefits outweighs the cost, like before hakar or the first mists boss
[2:03:18] Texas_Mizfit: will any team get to 160 points?
[2:03:19] ab77778: @Funky_Chemist they didnt nerf it. they completely removed an unintended interaction from the game

[2:06:32] Tuuba: emnitthy rofliexd but if the benefit outweighs that time spent then it would be worth it...
[2:06:35] xxAeryn: more than that rofliexd, if you don't commit major offensive cooldowns to the pride then it will sit at 20 stacks forever
[2:06:45] 5ft7ChristmasTree: we go agane :D
[2:06:47] labouletteducouscous: they just need to ask to get an extra run after the 5h sorry but in champions league the goalie wont suddenly disappear from the field lapiTHINK

[2:06:58] emnitthy: @tuuba sometimes the benefits do outweigh the time spent, sometimes they don‚Äôt
[2:07:02] xxAeryn: the benefit very rarely outweighs the amount of time and defensive+offensive cd's you have to commit to it
[2:07:07] Kuroz: wildigSip sheeesh
[2:07:09] rofliexd: @Tuuba the thing is, 40% buff for a minute does not outweight pride that takes longer than that sometimes and costs cds

[2:08:10] alzaca420: so tie breaker is time?
[2:08:12] ayohae: okay - we're gonna do some quick maths chat. if pride buff benefit stays static across key levels, and  pride's difficulty scales with key level, eventually those two functions will intersect
[2:08:36] emnitthy: That dude is just not getting it lol
[2:08:45] strayge: @alzaca420 yes
[2:08:48] Gh0stryder: WutFace
[2:08:48] ab77778: @Tuuba it is almost always a timeloss playing prides. the damage buff does not outweigh the time spent killing it.
[2:08:49] Lyonidasx: @ayohae 2+2 is 4
[2:08:53] UltraSpinach: Oh noes, keys again :0
[2:08:58] Tuuba: I don't think you're getting it
[2:08:59] StormGR: @ayohae 5Head
[2:09:01] rofliexd: @Tuuba you see them killing prides in those situations tho (mists for example). but most of the time on this level it is time & resource loss
[2:09:07] derTikimann: @alzaca420 highest key  then time
[2:09:08] UltraSpinach: cyriltPog cyriltPog cyriltPog
[2:09:12] shammy_bm: when SD +27?
[2:09:18] abantaki: !leaderboard
[2:09:24] brotan123: a 24 pride takes a bunch of cooldowns to kill or you just die

[2:09:27] alzaca420: thanks
[2:09:34] UltraSpinach: Weekly no leavers
[2:09:38] WaxBalloon: loud sound effects
[2:09:51] 8specter8: Most teams opt to skip the prides because the risk vrs reward is just not worth the investment of cooldowns.
[2:10:02] Zentoron_: the tweet LUL
[2:10:09] rofliexd: @Tuuba if your extra 40% equals to health of pride, it was worth it. in most of the time it is not because you waste cds on pride anyway so you dont giga big right after
[2:10:09] ab77778: @Tuuba youre not getting it, sorry. the benefits does not outweigh the time spent, it's the other way around
[2:10:31] 8specter8: Even IF the pride is an overall gain... the risk doesn't warrant it.  Too easy to mess up and then the loss is just a killer.
[2:10:34] Tuuba: Insanity7 I'm not saying it does
[2:10:48] Flaffiduck: @8specter8 well the pride tougness scale with key lvl the pride buff does not, in higher keys the reward of killing prides is rarely worth the cds u have to use to kill it
[2:10:51] adrianqt: But guys, why don't they do the prides?
[2:10:56] vagash123: This would be much more entertaining to watch if they were forced to use specific specs for specific keys that isn't always fire mage, ele sham and boomkin. I wanna see them try to time a 24 or 25 with an arcane mage, a survival hunter, a sub rogue, a mistweaver monk and a blood DK
[2:11:01] ayohae: chat will get KSM eventually
[2:11:08] rofliexd: @Tuuba in situations they need it for strat, they kill it but those guys after thousands of keys in sl found out that it is not worth it most of the time
[2:11:11] paiku_druid: are the Mists maze routes always the same?
[2:11:17] brotan123: yeah, just make them learn 48 specs before
[2:11:27] Chamilord: no
[2:11:28] brotan123: what a bonzo take
[2:11:31] SilverDragon53: @vagash123 thats not even possible
[2:11:38] Grimelush: @vagash123 and watch them wipe over and over again?
[2:11:38] EtherealFidelity: @adrianqt the pride is too hard and wastes cooldowns wich they can instead use on boss, so it slows them down on this high of a key
[2:11:39] Lyonidasx: @vagash123 you would then see maybe two teams compete and probably fail
[2:11:42] Nizeya: @Pi_Kitsune no
[2:11:45] Crossaction77: what are they going for a race to the highest key? sorry just tuned in
[2:11:47] christigiggity: @vagash123  they already had stuff like that the off meta key grps
[2:11:50] 8specter8: Especially at this point, where they aren't making their final push doing insane things to be the first place finishers.  You MIGHT see some nutty strats tomorrow though which could involve investing the effort into the prides.

[2:29:50] Lyonidasx: @Raekthechef should just not watch it, if you don't like it
[2:30:15] Raekthechef: I dont mind, would just be fun to see how high they could go with ban/picks system

[2:30:49] a_sl1me: BabyRage

[2:42:02] bjonesie: Definitly think Nagura is right. 27 pf and Hoa inc tomorrow
[2:42:04] Athinira: dhands Not necessarily. It's a very forgiving timer, so if you're just trying to get that extra 1 point, it cna be worth it
[2:42:04] kotakekw: 29 tyranical plaguefall
[2:42:04] Lyonidasx: @BagelRacer we need you back, can't do without people like you :(
[2:42:09] Stinpak: dang bear stream team still on mists
[2:42:23] hammack52: im lost here, do these teams have to complete the key they are doing to go do another dungen, or can they just cut  their loses for the time being and do something else
[2:42:24] Unholytree: @bagelracer determining the state of the game for a part of it, in a tournament? Cool
[2:42:26] dhands: @Athinira It's also never been done
[2:42:33] Sakue20: @Nisaro junkrat good rogue player, probably not much else there
[2:42:38] Kahlandra: @hammack52 they have 15 hours total over 3 days to complete the highest key possible

[2:42:49] miwxi: !rank
[2:42:53] Nisaro: @Sakue20 but they were running ele in SD and HoA
[2:42:55] Caesarxx: @hammack52 they have time limits of how long they can play each day, and they just push the highest keys they can.
[2:43:01] adrianqt: My guess is they don't have anyone who feels confident on Ele shaman

[2:43:31] raikoneN_: naowh doesent believe in sd, gingi does though
[2:43:33] Sakue20: @Nisaro who played the ele? i didn't see
[2:43:35] Caesarxx: and they can cut their losses and choose to re-do or do other dungeons at any time @hammack52
[2:43:36] swo12: they didn't say it isn't doable, they said it isn't worth doing given the time available
[2:43:36] Sylog: It was Echos last dungeon of the night
[2:43:43] hammack52: ok im just trying to figure out why in the world bear stream is not just going to one of the others and jump way ahead in points for the moment
[2:43:58] Ivoree: is echo winning already?
[2:44:04] Nisaro: @Sakue20 honestly didnt check. just went back in the VoD cause i found it weird and they did have an ele instead of a rogue
[2:44:14] femtv: being ahead on points is useless until the end of the tournament
[2:44:18] NotLimeThis: being ahead in points early doesn't really matter
[2:44:28] blazionboiii: can you make the persons still? of course i mean for good, slower, sweeter, forever
[2:44:30] OortCloudBig: @hammack52 because if they cant time 26s they stand no chance anyways
[2:44:35] NotLimeThis: noone has been to plaguefall yet because it's bolstering
[2:44:37] femtv: its a marathon not a sprint
[2:44:44] Lyonidasx: @hammack52 probably because it doesn't mean anything, if they jump ahead..
[2:44:53] Caesarxx: @hammack52 jumping ahead for the moment doesnt matter at all, and keeping everything fresh in your mind is more effective than switching gears to a whole new dungeon then coming back and potentially forgetting to do 1 important thing causing a wipe and wasting time
[2:44:56] Kodjentogg: @femtv i.0
[2:45:02] kycttv: They didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt doable. They said in the 15 hour time frame, with other dungeons able to be pushed higher, it‚Äôs a waste of time to do the 26
[2:45:06] Kodjentogg: o.0*
[2:45:08] dasru: if no moonkin, who is healing prides? :D
[2:45:23] mikotherogue: the shaman
[2:45:23] Yorandomexplode: for example echo was last in points yesterday but they are possibly the best team here
[2:45:26] dasru: or are they skipping all 5?
[2:45:27] Dwn003: @NotLimeThis Yah its bolstering and they also nerfed the plagueborer strat so now every1 had to come with new routes
[2:45:27] Caesarxx: @dasru bear, pog
[2:45:31] MachineMage: VoHiYo
[2:45:35] Ivoree: plaguefall will be much harder with the fix
[2:45:49] NotLimeThis: they only nerfed the MC/Cyclone abuse right?

[2:45:57] Sakue20: @Nisaro oh yea looks like junkrat played the sham in halls, so might just be preference?
[2:46:07] mikotherogue: ele shaman has a healing cd
[2:46:15] kodaema: also shaman ancestral+fae
[2:46:25] Lyonidasx: @NotLimeThis afaik yes, u basically just can't use them multiple times anymore
[2:46:36] Nisaro: @Sakue20 its an odd choice for mists. Their pulls are taking too long and theyre way too tight on the timer...
[2:47:13] nimeon01: LUL

[3:03:05] just_ok_viewer: ambition had 7 deaths on their 26, 5 on purpose

[3:45:57] Shacalicious_: Mods, would Skyline be allowed to do 25 instead of 26 if they wanted to?
[3:45:58] Kevmoeman: skyline had it earlier but their tank dc
[3:45:59] Ferality_: mists 26 is not one of the easiests, most players say its one of the hardest 26's on the board
[3:46:01] bk_n: Skyline so tilted after that DC BibleThump
[3:46:14] Tiln: @AuroryClaire Agree, but yea they do, if they can (i.e. its best) run the same comp, they will.
[3:46:22] AuroryClaire: tournaments also at terrible times for skyline
[3:46:31] SaltWoW: @Funky_Chemist iirc they said they can do 25 if they want
[3:46:39] Nakloh: Big inga push from Skyline coming up

[3:47:07] AuroryClaire: @Tiln well yes, if its best, they'll use that comp
[3:47:11] Ferality_: thats not true, ardenweald start just means they try for a +2
[3:47:14] Ebericas: Dorki is just built different
[3:47:19] 0mmurg: They are gonna ask after the end of day and DTBS will be like "oh we just got turned around and rolled with it"

[3:48:02] nymuehk: god i love dorki
[3:48:20] Ivoree: eho is pumpin
[3:48:21] Tiln: @AuroryClaire my point is just between two equally good options, where one requires switching and the other doesn't, they choose the other because that saves time
[3:48:36] KaisenSiru: pieGamer
[3:48:51] JanDeGrote1: @blackmaija Can't really compare MDI to the great push
[3:48:56] AuroryClaire: @Tiln they're going to just use whatever they have a plan for, they arent going to change up their plans for each dungeon because of a minute or two to change spec

[3:57:24] SaltWoW: @Elkethus they did the +26 with 3.5 minutes left, they're pretty comfortable in hoa
[3:57:37] Lyonidasx: @DatSirOnTheLeft Yes
[3:57:41] kaeyna: The casters literally said it's one of the hardest boss and not a big time investment since they do it first. What do you mean "big F" ? LUL
[3:57:42] Teik1066: It's a 24 non-tyrannical hakkar. Pretty shure DTBS can deal with it just fine.

[3:59:05] vaereee: @Elkethus itll give 1 more point than a 26:)
[3:59:06] Healingstat: 27 is nice for the tie breaker too, so it's a big win

[4:46:15] AuroryClaire: is it world first if its on tournament realm?
[4:46:16] Iolumadbro: SHEEEEEEEESH
[4:46:19] Blvdman: can't really call it a world first if you have access to all possible gear
[4:46:19] Greg1g: and possibly 28s for both
[4:46:27] Tankname: @Greg1g 27 HoA is already done
[4:46:29] aleskars: what are the rules in this, are they handed out gear so they are same ilvl?

[4:46:35] vision2111: 27 dos is too hard
[4:46:39] harca: jpc outperformed on rogue
[4:46:40] yochoc: it would have been done on live but every team that would be close was prepping on the tourney realm
[4:46:44] ariastrasza: I like this better than MDI, we get to see world first stuff
[4:46:45] Belirs: YEP indeed
[4:46:48] aleskars: are they playing on public servers?

[4:47:10] Adr3naliine: Finally ?
[4:47:14] carlosisbroke: yep #1
[4:47:19] Greg1g: I seriously think DoS 27 is highly possible
[4:47:21] aleskars: ty bois
[4:47:24] a_sl1me: @Blvdman most of the guilds that have been farming MCN have basically the same gear. maybe not useing the same classes
[4:47:31] 0mmurg: didnt realize they had been here the whole day dang
[4:47:34] KaisenSiru: cadyP
[4:47:44] JaxsunTV: Sheesh - Power level over 9000
[4:47:51] Shacalicious_: I can see the only reason DoS 27 wouldnt be possible is because of hakkar
[4:47:59] mykayyy: @Blvdman its arguably harder on tournament realm since they don't have avoidance
[4:48:01] logarthz1: if they will have at least 4 min left on timer then yeits possible
[4:48:06] Cerodivision: @Greg1g not with like 6.5hours left to play
[4:48:07] richtea1978: I‚Äôm sure Canexx used to be with Andybrew?

[4:48:35] logarthz1: @Funky_Chemist yeah every 27 try i saw was because of hakkar, they couldn't get done anything after hakkar
[4:48:39] quackerquack123: @richtea1978 indeed
[4:48:41] Kelthiz: They don't have avoidance tho.
[4:48:43] zeushatesem: drjay also previous r1 glad player right?
[4:48:44] Iolumadbro: i just think if i had their gear i could do it too, not compete vs the best in the world :)
[4:48:48] BrainseekerEU: sheeesh gonne be close
[4:48:53] Blvdman: @mykayyy ok how many people are actually getting avoidance on live its rng, but they have access to all perfect gear with sockets and can literally mix gear for perfect ratio per dungeon basis
[4:48:55] davy_: they were both in Pieces yes cannex swapped guilds @richtea1978
[4:48:56] lDanny: Dr Jay one of the most decorated? hasn't he only won 1 mdi?

[5:14:40] bigbuzkiller: @Joschi174 yes, they just cant start any in 15 mins
[5:14:41] swordart_19: YEP
[5:14:44] ab77778: @Pperoni so youd rather be watching lower keys being pushed / slower times in the mdi to allow for some wierd off meta comps being played?
[5:14:52] pallazzi: @kodaema where you play ranked m+ againist other teams
[5:14:59] Auviance: YEP
[5:14:59] Catori94: is YEP trolling or why are there still 3 dungeons untouched?
[5:15:04] Pperoni: @kaeyna No I complain because Blizzard uses the "your spec is fine in PvP and Mythic raiding so you don't have to be buffed for Mythic+" excuse and people have no other choice than to pick absolute top tier meta classes to compete in these events making every comb the same
[5:15:09] thehorniestpeeshlllt: Any reason none of them even tried plaguefall ?
[5:15:11] OnyxPenumbra: oh yep

[5:16:27] kaeyna: @Pperoni Yeah reflect about your answer for a bit and maybe you'll understand how it makes no sense.
[5:16:28] TheDadBodGod: @kaeyna why buff specs that're within 1% of each other because the top 0.0001% of players doing high end content use the same comps?
[5:16:36] ghostyyrose: cvL cvR
[5:16:41] naughtdread: SD so free it's expensive
[5:16:45] hzwo: what is echo doing atm?

[5:16:49] Rotodin: The+5 depleters are very opinionated today.
[5:16:50] Phasedr: within 1% of each other Kappa
[5:17:01] coffeemugs: I know what he means, but it's a really wierd way to say it.
[5:17:09] Wiznarf: 1%, we found ion!
[5:17:14] swordart_19: Kappa
[5:17:16] Crow7500: my *** is 999, i can say what i want okay
[5:17:24] TheDadBodGod: found the +14 depleters
[5:17:27] olorindh: @Pperoni The top guilds for these tournaments are playing to win, it doesn't matter if a spec is 0.5% better than another. If there are specs that are better than others, only those specs are going to be played
[5:17:30] Theonden42: this run is deathless, if we ignore the deaths
[5:17:33] muyuu: fmage and surv hunter within 1% of each other Kappa
[5:17:33] yochoc: the KSM buyers coming out in DROVES to voice their opinions this stream
[5:17:34] ennki_eu: @Znarfalot LUL
[5:17:34] NateYoungTV: @kaeyna competitors are always going to take whatever the single best thing is so comp variety will NEVER be huge. any solution to it would cause it to be not fun for the competitiors. if you don't believe me, check the competitors twitter feeds and see their opinions on spec/class banning.
[5:17:39] Crow7500: this is actually a really fun tourney mode
[5:17:47] ChipJiggins: Halkias surprise MVP this tournament
[5:17:51] Crow7500: i hope this gets more traction
[5:17:59] Tanidge: LUL
[5:18:03] chasen218: what is the prize tho from all of this?
[5:18:03] NylleTV: Did YEP stop playing?
[5:18:07] Phasedr: feral druid and balance druid within 1% of each other Kappa
[5:18:08] Pperoni: @kaeyna just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it makes no sense, read it again
[5:18:14] MasterKjn: what happened to YEP team
[5:18:19] Shearin77: @Crow7500 i agree
[5:18:26] Coriollis: @Crow7500 is not bad , wish they had 1 or 2 class ban / map each team that competes

[5:18:52] Wiznarf: Capped classes and uncapped, .008% difference
[5:18:54] mikkeal0: @kaeyna lmao @pperoni
[5:19:00] TheDadBodGod: @Phasedr i too love cherry picking
[5:19:06] Crow7500: yeah, i would have liked to see not-MDI only classes. kind of disappointing, but that's not the teams faults, that's the balancers
[5:19:07] SixtyBizzy: @Ronangic Maybe you should go cast bro
[5:19:11] 0mmurg: rut ro
[5:19:17] casti3lll: Oof
[5:19:21] Lv_ly: naguuraMonkaS naguuraMonkaS naguuraMonkaS
[5:19:23] NateYoungTV: @Crow7500 if they did that, competitors have said they would refuse to play because being forced to play specs that are worse, even if by 0.5%, is not fun for them
[5:19:29] Ehnaton1: doa with 29 prediction? bold
[5:19:30] swordart_19: F
[5:19:33] SixtyBizzy: Tom wildigSad

[5:19:41] ThePawPaw: Jack on last place....did you played Disco again LUL
[5:19:42] pacificsunset: leader board is broke it shows yep hasn't played for an hour and i am watching dr jay so they are still playing
[5:19:46] Vesrun: wildigPandaW
[5:19:51] yochoc: banning specs for different keys would be way too hard to keep track of
[5:19:58] axan94: just imagine the practice you need to put in if they other team just can ban a class....
[5:20:00] kaeyna: @Pperoni No, you complain because you think you playing a specific "non meta class" stops you from performing on this kind of stage. Where basically most of those players are playing 3 to 4 different classes to adapt.
[5:20:05] SixtyBizzy: @TXXSHI they get next wildigEZ
[5:20:18] yochoc: They're 2 minutes behind @pacificsunset
[5:20:39] SixtyBizzy: wildigW I mighta wiped but I can still combust

[5:20:52] angerfist_1993: yep loosed to much time in TOP sadge
[5:20:52] HecticSpaniard: just delete all non meta classes, maybe than they can balance the game LUL
[5:21:07] Raekthechef: just buff mage
[5:21:09] richtea1978: They probably have to delay in case Tettles f bombs again
[5:21:13] Hastif: PF indeed
[5:21:24] Theonden42: make game super basic, mage rogue priest war no specs
[5:21:26] Lyonidasx: Game is balanced pretty well
[5:21:29] Crow7500: the AoE capping is what created this meta. and they're not going back on that.
[5:21:30] Gizurrr: I mean balance isn't the worse this season, we see 2 different tank specs being played at the highest level
[5:21:35] 0mmurg: Idk why they don't just make every spec unique and different but also perfectly balanced in multiple situations :(
[5:21:37] pexxxyy: @HecticSpaniard you realise that there will always be "meta classes" in competitions like this, yes?
[5:21:39] heavysjaak: All these people thinking that meta matters playing their baby 15 keys.
[5:21:39] grimelocked: @HecticSpaniard another classes become meta then. And cycle begins again
[5:21:44] WallerWilly: and chat would cry over the new meta, never ending cycle
[5:21:47] billabong212: they didn't pull a mob in the first pull they should have so they reset
[5:21:53] HecticSpaniard: :D
[5:21:53] Moobot: Find more from team Sheeesh here: http://blizz.ly/TeamSheeesh
[5:21:54] TheDadBodGod: there will quite literally always be a meta
[5:22:00] JanDeGrote1: @0mmurg because you cant do that ever
[5:22:01] Crow7500: meta doesn't matter below 20
[5:22:05] NateYoungTV: balance will never be perfect unless they make every single spec exactly the same
[5:22:06] SixtyBizzy: wildigRain balance class tears
[5:22:06] jendia42: @HecticSpaniard 2 diffrent tanks and 4 dps specs isn't that small of a class pool considering how high the level of play is here
[5:22:13] kycttv: Ambition is in plaguefall
[5:22:15] yochoc: I think the game is the best when everyone is a mage who only casts frostbolt
[5:22:15] thicolascage: Shawn "shawnbuell" Buell is the best moderator in the business. Whenever I try to fight Nightbot, he is right there to unban me when I inevitably lose. Without shawnbuell in chat, I would still be timed out and have no chance at winning the hoodie. Everyone please pay your respects to shawn.
[5:22:19] Crow7500: even the worst melee, feral druid, can time 20s
[5:22:21] Gizurrr: even at 20 you can play anything
[5:22:24] kycttv: Can we see ambition by chance
[5:22:27] mikotherogue: meta doesnt even really matter at 20-23 either
[5:22:28] ennki_eu: @Crow7500 more like dmg profile tbh
[5:22:30] Lyonidasx: People just want to see their spec being meta, so they can blame others when they deplete their weekly +14 LUL
[5:22:32] Lv_ly: thats right you're getting Sheeeshed wildigSip
[5:22:39] 0mmurg: @JanDeGrote1 Yeah was sarcasm its obviously unreasonable but people act like they aren't doing it by choice
[5:22:39] TheDadBodGod: correct, meta only matters for the highest level of play
[5:22:46] HecticSpaniard: its nice to see so many agree that the balance isnt that bad :)
[5:22:54] touritowow: of player
[5:22:56] kycttv: Ambition is in PF @tettles
[5:23:02] swiftale: @Lyonidasx i'd love to see my survival hunter spec being meta regardless!
[5:23:02] WallerWilly: meta doesn't mather bellow 24, there's a fury war with 25s and 26s what's your excuse
[5:23:07] ariastrasza: Oh Snap, Ambition going Plaguefall
[5:23:12] Rocky_XCI: RETAIL ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[5:23:12] Pperoni: @kaeyna nah I'm performing good enough for my taste with my off meta comb, all I'm saying is that I'd love to see something other than ele sham, mage and owl once in a while. This tournament is ***
[5:23:15] Bokyko: For sure but where u saw lf monk healer or priest...
[5:23:17] LongHammer34: mo clout
[5:23:17] Zorkwins: PogChamp
[5:23:21] halfandhave: d4atnos is funny
[5:23:25] TheDadBodGod: the only problem is people thinking they need full meta for their KSM, which isn't true
[5:23:27] jendia42: @Crow7500 Even 20s or 21s can be timed with a non meta comp. My push comp was brew. resto sham, ret, fury, unholy and we did a few 21s.
[5:23:30] mikkeal0: buff hunter BibleThump
[5:23:35] itofreestlye: fury is meta bro. lmfaoo. nf fury is really good

[5:24:02] milsolo: Plaguefall nerftankPOGGERS
[5:24:02] Lyonidasx: @swiftale I'm not saying all specs are balanced in an equal way, looking at Survival and so on, but it's not like it isn't playable at all
[5:24:03] improvecap: yeah fury got a lot of buffs over time
[5:24:06] livv2115: even if a off-meta class is possible to time 23 key, you definitely wouldn't do that with pugs, their mindset is so narrow that they only invite "meta" classes
[5:24:08] JRose: fury is really good, its not meta. meta are the classes you are seeing here
[5:24:16] bigbuzkiller: jpc back to rogue
[5:24:18] Zorkwins: New dungeon PogChamp

[5:25:05] SixtyBizzy: @quackerquack123 TRUEEEE! mb
[5:25:06] Frippe_TV: @Pperoni i mean they all want to win, so why not do it right? why should they change their comp to something non meta just so you can enjoy watching it?
[5:25:09] NateYoungTV: there are survival hunters doing 21s and 22s iirc like y'all act like the specs in this stream are the only ones viable for your weekly 15s
[5:25:10] improvecap: but the way to push on live in general is to wait for perfect weeks

[5:25:48] pennyzebun: @heavysjaak it‚Äôs been fixed
[5:25:51] Pperoni: @frippe_tv not blaming it on the players, I'm blaming blizzard, but now we're moving in circles here.

[5:48:06] Belirs: strategic brezzing :D
[5:48:16] Kahlandra: these are the last two teams playing i believe
[5:48:20] AuroryClaire: @ayohae because a 24 plague is harder than a 27 hoa lol
[5:48:25] Bubblegun40: @frizzaud pretty sure junkrat is a girl
[5:48:29] mikotherogue: junkrat the enigma
[5:48:35] bigrandy99: are hpals just op?
[5:48:36] aen70: cca 40k ppl on streams from this event, not bad

[5:49:24] AuroryClaire: It was sarcasm chat
[5:49:33] bariumjones: @Pijan_the_drunk yes
[5:49:40] Hinzir: not easiest , it was done with plagueborer fortified
[5:49:43] bigrandy99: i dunno whats happening but this still fun to watch
[5:49:51] AuroryClaire: Ya'll, the affixes are a thing, they aren't gonna 28 this plaguefall
[5:49:58] Ganksy36: yoooo that transition was nuts
[5:50:07] Hinzir: there is no guarantee even for 27 pf tyranical
[5:50:34] ReaperMvp: echo low
[5:50:47] Alasacy: 27 3rd boss might one shot
[5:50:49] kycttv: I think if any key goes to 28 it‚Äôll be PF but no higher. And 27 max for any other

[5:51:43] bigrandy99: @Pijan_the_drunk do  they get bonus points for anything
[5:51:45] SixtyBizzy: @wildigenia
[5:51:45] ayohae: i mean you're probably delusional or inexperienced if you think 28 pf isn't possible
[5:51:48] spectrashock: they messed up and didn't get the slime buffs which is why they got 2 rainds
[5:51:56] wanblanco: full moon on add KEKW

[5:52:32] a_b_________: we got a number victory royale
[5:52:32] kycttv: @auroryclaire You could be right but I guess we will see. These teams have been known to pull out things that were thought to not have been possible.

[5:56:06] menhirus: has there been any hunters?
[5:56:12] SixtyBizzy: @Anodortam Leaking strats
[5:56:26] a_b_________: Covenants were a mistake :/ I'm sad I can enjoy any type of WoW rn. I didn't play classic so if I tried to play TBC I couldn't afford anything, and I can't play retail because covenants are too hard to change.
[5:56:27] bigbuzkiller: @scartotem not that i know off, but they should say something about it somewhere.
[5:56:28] Vocox23: @JanDeGrote1 Man, just look at the points, math is here 20+ points over the second team
[5:56:30] techzz_: @scartotem not unless nobody does a higher key than the key u 2 chested
[5:56:31] Zilasa: 0 hunters

[5:56:49] aardiglastig: They switched over to Guardian dudu
[5:56:55] itsArlong: :(
[5:56:56] lynixxis: @4Head_EleGiggle It takes two weeks to change covenants. what?
[5:56:57] menhirus: And here I though MM hunters are good. Oof
[5:57:11] Andybrew3: Did you guys like the DOS?

[5:57:12] a_b_________: Yeah 2 weeks is a lot
[5:57:14] JanDeGrote1: @Facenomore right if thats your logic its flawed but let me try to explain it other teams have not done all 6 dungeons yet since they have a full day left tomorrow
[5:57:18] Coriollis: look how much dmg it spikes on 25 , people get arround 12% hp easily
[5:57:21] itsArlong: @menhirus they have good burst aoe but why take a hunter when mage exists
[5:57:24] mikotherogue: it takes 1s to change covs
[5:57:34] sverrepuz: DOS was SHEESH!
[5:57:34] LifeisPepeHands: MM hunter was good 3 months ago
[5:57:35] mikotherogue: it takes 2 weeks to go back to a cov
[5:57:38] Neroasdf: are teams allowed to look at other teams streams during the push?
[5:57:39] menhirus: @Baldy_ :(
[5:57:42] Crystallize007: @Andybrew3 blaster
[5:57:44] Kahlandra: gg!
[5:57:46] Elkethus: well done!

[5:57:48] Amadaqt: @Andybrew3 if you would have streamed it 100% LUL
[5:57:48] kowaikoro: echo popped off
[5:57:51] Senen_: @4Head_EleGiggle If you start the change monday, you'll be done on tuesday. That's effectively two days.
[5:57:51] bezerkaaaa: 27 halls > 24 pf so ewcho is winning hard
[5:57:53] lynixxis: @4Head_EleGiggle That's 2 weeks only if you've been that cov before. It's instant if you haven't. Why are you complaining?
[5:57:54] Psybear_tv: @Andybrew3 nailed it.
[5:57:54] swordart_19: gg
[5:57:54] AuroryClaire: Echo way in the lead with a 27 tbh

[5:58:11] Silithos: @lynixxis there is not only the lockout but also the campaign to complete, renown etc Now they add even covenant legendarys which adds to this misery
[5:58:11] Elkethus: gg
[5:58:12] Senen_: @4Head_EleGiggle Or tuesday/wednesday, if you're not NA
[5:58:12] Vocox23: @JanDeGrote1 I just look at the numbers. Numbers always tell truth
[5:58:16] Healingstat: the +2 to end the day is big too
[5:58:19] FearEngine: Did Yep drop out?
[5:58:23] eky3_: asuna is the goat <3

[5:58:58] Insidieux: sheesh and echo are the winners of today i think with my boys ambition following
[5:58:58] ankushmeena7777: +17 of plag is tough,
[5:58:58] lynixxis: @Silithos All of the cov legendaries kind of are bad, but if you don't have a stockpile of soul ash right now, that's your own fault. And you can hit 40 renown in a week.
[5:58:58] bigbuzkiller: @Jeathebelle amazing guy and keep it up!!!

[5:59:38] Elkethus: thanks all that was fun
[5:59:39] Silithos: @lynixxis if you play 40h a week its not an issue, yes
[5:59:39] JanDeGrote1: @Facenomore but what you say doesnt matter since you fail to figure out why Ambition is ahead atm
[5:59:41] zackbtw__: @hipposareneat
[5:59:43] rezeruo12: Ambition Sadge

[6:00:12] lynixxis: @Silithos You can cap in like...half that time unless you're doing dumb stuff. But that's fine. Split it over 4 weeks then. That's not hard to do.

[6:00:24] Pooglemcbots: AND Ambition can totally do a 27 halls easy
