[1:42:57] Theduskflyer: nah they need the aug.....they strong. but not with out aug
[1:42:59] Molvonos: Because of the stats they give.
[1:43:06] daniel85mg: Shadow was very good before, and mage gota rework same patch.
[1:43:32] Molvonos: Yea, they'd have been OP even without.
[1:43:32] Selenar21: You have to have a mass dispel
[1:43:36] szble: so funny hearing god comp in this context
[1:43:43] MaddyLif3: spriest getting nerfed yet again tuesday

[1:49:16] nephttv_: IF anything at all, you run disc priest with a demo lock for the double PI comp but, i dont think itll win
[1:49:42] AlphasaurusRexx: fire mage pumps waaaaay too much damage with mobility. i dont see it changing
[1:49:49] Rudric_Ice: Why is blizz so bad at balancing stuff
[1:49:54] dutchie76: people are still going to bring spriest for PI and Mass dispel
[1:50:48] dutchie76: 10.2 is going to be interesting

[2:26:20] Rudric_Ice: Kinda cool that frost dk gets no buffs
[2:27:02] nephttv_: To me, that sounds like they want a 3 dps comp to have the same total dps as a 2 dps 1 aug
[2:27:14] dawnovun: Blizzard is applying flawed logic, the way apply flawed logic to the rest of stuff lately.

[2:34:12] tonyr23: its pretty bad tho even in M+ keys everyone wants an aug evoker
[2:34:15] MaySaveYou: BM buffs rofl. Bm is a leveling spec.
[2:34:19] board4life65: yeah they are switching
[2:34:19] nephttv_: in the first 3 days aug was out, the minimum io went up by 50
[2:34:36] Rudric_Ice: Where is super Saiyan comp ?
[2:34:36] Minje12: It has been more much than that. The first week AUG was out, it was around 130 points. Then around 5-7 points EVERY day since then.
[2:34:47] Electafuzz: LUL
[2:35:10] Electafuzz: nerf hunters more pls
[2:35:12] tonyr23: BM is doing fine
[2:35:13] nephttv_: Bm was good in shadowlands and last tier it was good as well
[2:35:13] Electafuzz: need more tears
[2:35:14] nephttv_: lmao
[2:35:29] JLM23: People drunk

[2:51:35] ItsXolten: Hunter is really bad in keys rn. Only 4 hunters are in title range 0 are MM.
[2:51:46] Sereannon: Maybe I'm old but I feel a pure dps class should always be in top third
[2:51:48] Electafuzz: I feel like this xpac the specs are pretty close together all things considered
[2:51:55] Electafuzz: nothing that's absolutely horrendous
[2:53:24] ItsXolten: My friend seen 2 mounts drop last week
[2:53:44] Kamcast: @rudric_ice There are 1.2 million player that log on each day, i doubt most people do that. Maybe like 200k at the most.
[2:53:49] Electafuzz: dps loss if you move Kappa
[2:54:18] Rudric_Ice: @kamcast  and where are u getting those numbers from ?
[2:54:40] Electafuzz: imagine this was a ffxiv boss
[2:54:53] Kamcast: just google active wow subs and look through a bunch of sites
[2:55:16] Kamcast: wow for sure has over 1mill people logging in daily
[2:55:48] Electafuzz: crendorClap
[2:55:49] Kamcast: Twitch makes it seem like only 25kppl log in lol
[2:56:12] Electafuzz: dead game obvi
[2:56:22] Rudric_Ice: U are naive if u think wow has 1.2 active players right now maybe MAUs but no way they have 1 million active players stop the kap
[2:56:37] tydevane: Idk man, 1 mill at this point of the xpac seems generous still. Early and late expansion for sure though
[2:56:49] thymos_: i think everything in life is cringe
[2:56:56] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @Kamcast the question is how many of those "1 million" players properly interact with the game during the mid patches, and how many are just social
[2:57:10] Kamcast: you guys really think it doesn't have 1.2mil world wide? haaa
[2:57:50] Kamcast: @catliviathezombiekitten everyone has their own view of what a "player" is
[2:57:59] tydevane: Concurrent? Unlikely. There may be 1.2 mill unique account logins on weekends, though
[2:58:42] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: Also, does your websites count retail specifically, or classic too? Because that will greatly skew the numbers.
[2:59:52] OverPoweredGG: 750k?

[3:00:34] Kamcast: Wow is wow in my eyes so yes classic also
[3:00:34] Rudric_Ice: China has no wow now so ain't no way they have 1mill active players
[3:00:43] tydevane: Definitely higher overall but lower retail if I had to guess
[3:01:39] Rudric_Ice: I'm not counting classic
[3:01:40] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:02:17] Kamcast: You think there is more classic players then retail at this moment?
[3:02:27] tydevane: Retention seems great, yeah. A ton of people gave it up after Shadowlands for sure though, me included. Recently came back and am enjoying classic and retail atm though
[3:02:36] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @Kamcast Maybe in 2 weeks when HC is released.

[3:03:34] iiTz__Reflex: As a casual. I'm enjoying it both PVP and PVE. Its kept me around longer than I've typically stayed
[3:04:02] Kamcast: outta the 6.5 billion ppl in the world that's without china there definitely is at least 1mill player online every day
[3:04:19] Rudric_Ice: Waiting for classic hardcore personally don't care about retail nowadays
[3:04:33] Thulfikar: I personally have no complaints about DF it's never been this good to play. Imagine logging into wow and doing what you want immediately. not worrying about dailies etc
[3:05:02] Kamcast: @Thulfikar agree
[3:05:18] Kamcast: you can make it as grindy as you want now
[3:05:31] tydevane: It made a lot of great changes for sure, especially the flexibility of specs being brought back and expanded further than ever before. There were a few steps back imo as someone that just came back after a break from early S2 Slands, but definitely a better xpac than the previous two. BFA and SL just soured a ton of the playerbase unfortunately

[3:06:15] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @Thulfikar How do you afford gems, enchants, repairs and so on without doing dailies? O-o
[3:06:45] Kamcast: its great cause having that ez gearing and content bleeds into ppl keep watching streams and engaged in the game
[3:06:46] nosleeps1221: not sure If I should come back to do M+
[3:06:51] Lintgamer: What mount did you get? @Towelliee
[3:06:54] Rudric_Ice: @kamcast that's not a very good assumption of active players
[3:06:58] board4life65: we need more ways to farm Aspect's fragments
[3:07:06] Sereannon: They need to add sharing for ZC rares. That's a big casual player problem
[3:07:19] Lintgamer: Grats ont that and good luck
[3:07:21] nosleeps1221: just seems like kinda tedious now cause I play more fun casual games that are less grindy
[3:07:34] Thulfikar: @catliviathezombiekitten honestly, do anything you like, it makes lots of gold. The best way to make gold atm is boosting players and the M+ dungeons are so smooth compared to old expansions
[3:08:28] Kaype92: Towelliee what's the fastest way to level up a new seasonal alt in D4?
[3:08:34] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @Thulfikar I stopped playing in feb because I felt i was bleeding so much gold despite doing all dailies and rares etc.
[3:08:37] abushir: !drops
[3:08:43] ItsXolten: Brew was played in TGP today. Was very surprised
[3:08:45] Rudric_Ice: I never had more fun in wow than BFA's last patch that is corruptions
[3:09:05] nosleeps1221: also I dont like not being able to access my character and mounts cause I have not spend $20 on the game
[3:09:11] nosleeps1221: per month
[3:09:23] tydevane: @nosleeps1221 that's what I came back for, and I'll admit that finding a group to push with has been a little tedious. I have exp from Legion - SL pushing pretty high in all roles and it still has been a bit of a teeth pulling experience to find people, but the game is in a small lull at this point of a patch
[3:09:51] tydevane: So somewhat expected

[3:11:02] Thulfikar: @catliviathezombiekitten There are usually 7-10 WQs that give 600+ gold. if you choose a profession and push for it to help you proc multicrafts and farm awakened elements. You'll make lots of gold
[3:11:37] Kamcast: na burn phase is gonna kill you
[3:12:23] sixRlNGS_: 89
[3:12:39] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @Thulfikar Okay, assume the casual route then. I'll do the WQ's but not the professions. That's 7k gold a day plus drops from mobs and stuff. How much is a basic weapon enchant? How much is a stack of 20 dps flasks?
[3:13:03] Kamcast: Yup

[3:13:44] jamesc398: Is this the new mega dungeon?
[3:13:44] Thulfikar: @catliviathezombiekitten if think if you're only gonna do WQs and rares, you'll need alts to sustain it.
[3:13:55] Rudric_Ice: If riot's mmo is f2p and actually good wow is in trouble
[3:13:58] Herzenliegen: 4k per token is nice
[3:14:04] tydevane: Hope they never take the sub off. F2p just opens up p2w
[3:14:21] tydevane: Whatever p2w is in an MMO at least
[3:14:37] Rudric_Ice: @tydevane  u have  tokens u already have p2w
[3:14:39] Kamcast: wow has been in trouble for 10 years now and its still hangin on
[3:14:45] xziyn: @tydevane It's already p2w for the rwf tbh
[3:14:53] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @catliviathezombiekitten That's what I thought, sadly. You have to put in so much time to just do the basics in WoW these days. Food, flasks, oils etc for M+ and raids + enchants etc when you get upgrades. It's a fulltime job even playing casually T_T
[3:14:54] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch

[3:15:11] tydevane: Yeah, true tbf @xziyn
[3:15:27] tydevane: It'd be even more invasive at lower levels though imo
[3:15:45] Anguyen92ab: @catliviathezombiekitten Funny thing, I got back into WoW because I wanted to do the AH grind to get HS packs and then I like the AH grind enough that I decided to forgo playing HS again for the time being.
[3:16:45] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @catliviathezombiekitten that's funny actually XD I am glad other people can enjoy it, the frustration for me just comes from the fact I don't feel I -can log in and play what I want-

[3:21:24] iiTz__Reflex: I think they'll introduce something along the lines of paragon levels....not the board....Just levels past 100
[3:21:33] Thulfikar: @catliviathezombiekitten Was it different before? I mean how was it for you in previous expansions?
[3:21:56] thymos_: wildstar OMEGALUL
[3:22:05] KristianAG: !drops
[3:22:34] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @catliviathezombiekitten It has been pretty bad in the last couple of expansions tbh. It's the only reason I am not playing DF. Having to think about making money (which we do irl every day anyway) it just kills the fun.
[3:23:10] Rudric_Ice: 8 devs on poe vs 100devs on diablo lol
[3:23:21] iiTz__Reflex: hitting EVERY class with the nerf stick versus buffing the other lacking builds was a HUGE mistake
[3:23:36] Thulfikar: @catliviathezombiekitten I see. That's fair tbh. Probably bots to blame for that since the ingame money making mechanics can't compensate for the inflation bots cause
[3:24:33] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @catliviathezombiekitten Yeah pretty much. I always run double gathering and just gather while doing dailies, questing and so on, but it barely does anything for me XD
[3:24:39] KingSlayerYotam: Diablo 4 is a frustrating ARPG . Tried poe after D4 and it was more fun, more mobs, less GCD
[3:25:17] tydevane: I can't even say with an actual educated take, is DF more expensive if we're talking gearing up characters though? There's some cost involved with crafted gear and upgrading, but the SL legendaries were prob more expensive
[3:25:29] thymos_: he realized that the game is dying Kappa
[3:25:30] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: They actually said PoE1 currently only has 8 devs with the rest of the team working on PoE2
[3:25:32] Electafuzz: not surprising
[3:25:34] Electafuzz: nerds are toxic
[3:25:50] tydevane: But yeah, bots farming and selling hundreds of thousands of gold for a fraction of tokens prices is always going to lead to the inflation issue
[3:26:30] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @tydevane It's not necessarily -expensive-, but doing standard daily stuff still won't cover those costs. That's the problem.

[3:26:46] TheUnknowing: i think D4 is very fun, POE is fun too but just over complicated for most.
[3:27:32] tydevane: @catliviathezombiekitten fair enough. I always come back to a decent hoard from previous xpacs after my breaks. Starting with no gold when I came back a couple weeks ago would for sure have made things more complicated
[3:27:51] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @tydevane that's basically me every time i come back XD

[3:32:08] Anguyen92ab: I also didn't like the fact that in order to be more efficient in M+, I had to get an essence that requires PVP to get it.

[3:33:09] xziyn: Even 8.3 and .5 were weird, why having a corruption vendor but having it rotate, made no sense
[3:33:20] blinca: best expansion legion, i would farm concordance levels again any day

[3:34:33] KingSlayerYotam: For me, BFA was fun. Didnt farm azerite but mounts, and had a blast
[3:34:45] Electafuzz: I miss MoP
[3:34:49] Electafuzz: mostly for the pvp
[3:34:54] thymos_: so #1 is cata
[3:35:02] Anguyen92ab: Zones were good, M+s were good.  Raids were good.  The grind was pretty horrifying at times.
[3:35:05] tydevane: Nya heroic pug full tank runs, who remembers
[3:35:09] Rudric_Ice: I played the most in BFA
[3:35:21] Sereannon: Legion for me
[3:35:27] Anguyen92ab: They also had the AH mount on sale and that's a big win.
[3:35:38] tydevane: Corruption created so much dumb shit lol

[4:28:11] Omni35: It's to difficult for new players to get in to pvp. You have to get your ass kicked for a year to learn the game. No new blood makes pvp slowly die out.
[4:28:20] rosina_scarlett: archage
[4:29:13] Dreathhammer: The high end pvp community doesn't make it easy either. Countless times where one mistake causes people to go insane over really nothing
[4:29:22] Mozzeyy_: its 1-2

[4:32:33] Anguyen92ab: The only thing I have a small grip on is the profession talent trees and the grind it takes to get there.

[5:14:51] Elizare: 5th edition is the most current i believe yes
[5:14:57] Noshpan: I started playing D&D with AD&D 2nd edition in '89
[5:15:00] Nokterian: yeah d&d does have it's own rules and plays

[5:15:01] Itsamemareo96: yo tdog what should i gear next my DH or my paly for the guild
[5:15:10] Elizare: tweaks to rules, additions subtractions between each edition
[5:15:57] alluza: @Towelliee  oh it drops only1 per raid
[5:16:46] Nokterian: Neverwinter Nights is d&d as well

[5:17:28] RagingPunk: neverwinter nights was stand alone single player game as well

[5:18:11] Nokterian: im talking about the older game from neverwinter nights from 2002
[5:18:55] KorbenDallas815: i know you'll be there no matter what, it's just that the others more than likely won't be there
[5:19:19] Nokterian: LUL
[5:19:23] xmedpakx: old ass game
[5:19:24] KorbenDallas815: they'll likely have 'excuses' of why they couldn't make it

[5:19:29] Nokterian: you played a lot of d&d then
[5:19:29] board4life65: how many mythic sarkareth kills have you done?

[5:19:52] Shaele: dude, neverwinter is dnd one of the oldest modules out there
[5:20:05] carmelchaos: WoW is based off of Everquest, which was based off of someone's advanced DND game
[5:20:48] xmedpakx: all mmo is based off DnD, Wow internal roles that occur based off DnD
[5:21:22] LuiBMHunter: other games just hide the dice rolling behind the scenes
[5:21:23] xmedpakx: nah wow has dice rolling you just never see it
[5:21:39] gimmlay: Vermintide is dnd right?
[5:22:01] xmedpakx: different rules is all
[5:22:03] OlympicPNW: WoW is too
[5:22:08] Noshpan: I thought Vermintide was Warhammer?
[5:22:38] Tornadogenesis: It is
[5:22:40] gimmlay: Vernintide is warhammer my bad lol
[5:22:48] Shaele: god ppl are stupid, dnd is a ruleset, warhamemr and wow is not
[5:22:56] gimmlay: Wake and bake lol
[5:25:03] LuiBMHunter: oh dear - you've cursed it
[5:25:07] Tornadogenesis: I'd say that DnD is influential across a lot of RPG based games.

[5:29:53] Nokterian: no real gpu's
[5:29:58] Nokterian: Arc 770
[5:30:01] Nehcrom: They are trying to compete on the GPU market.
[5:30:11] Day_Walker78: intel is making the ARC GPU
[5:30:16] Nehcrom: From what I understood it is ok but doesn't hold a candle to nvidia so far.
[5:30:24] Nokterian: they have been since last year making gpu's
[5:30:26] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Tornadogenesis (warning)
[5:30:44] Nokterian: its not like a 4090 at all
[5:30:48] postman_quest: Old news
[5:31:07] Tornadogenesis: Yeah, people say it's good bang for the buck.. was just wondering if anyone had one
[5:31:15] TheUnknowing: Im using an AMD card right now, actually been fairly impressed with it. Prefer Nvidia's software though.
[5:31:42] Tornadogenesis: Price would be my guess, but idk just learning about it
[5:31:46] Nokterian: it isnt a high end card its more close to a 3070
[5:32:18] ClockworkZen: At the moment, the sales pitch for intel cards is that AMD has rough drivers and Nvidia is over expensive. Intel is competing for the affordable entry/mid level cards
[5:32:19] TheUnknowing: I think it will take awhile for them to build up to where Nvidia and AMD are at
[5:32:25] Dreathhammer: You would hope there is a plan LOL
[5:32:37] Nokterian: there drivers where awful
[5:32:43] its_andyd: gotta get in the ai armsrace
[5:32:51] Tornadogenesis: Well if they provide okayish cards for a good price; they'll work out. Competition is good for everyone
[5:32:55] Dreathhammer: runescape even
[5:33:18] its_andyd: nobody seems to realize that in order to train models for ai, gpus are used
[5:33:38] Deathonic: What is your main?
[5:34:53] ClockworkZen: that didn't work out so well for Everquest Next
[5:35:04] Tornadogenesis: Hope it works out. Need new life in the mmo genre
[5:35:49] Tornadogenesis: EQ next was basically killed off by a buyout from my understanding.
[5:37:43] ClockworkZen: that might be true, but as an early supporter who played the alpha, there was quite a bit of shaken faith in the community when deadlines were missed and development went quiet
[5:38:04] Tornadogenesis: He has the connections, at least. Mike Morhaime is hanging around with Dreamhaven too
[5:38:12] Arsenic_Gunner: Would have to be something like SoA level shit
[5:38:36] Paladuv: The speed of development with URE5 and AI will speed things up ALLOT.

[5:54:21] Rudric_Ice: wow might be f2p by that time fo sure
[5:54:28] Blas0n: It lets you escape reality and its become a family name now.  Dads, kids, grandkids and great grand kids now play this game @Towelliee
[5:54:35] its_andyd: People said the same thing about blockbuster but it failed to adapt to the digital age and was overtaken by services like Netflix

[5:55:49] Ponas91: as long there is no revolution in the mmo-genre WoW will be king
[5:55:55] Tornadogenesis: I was not trying to imply WoW will die. WoW as a brand will be around forever in some form.
[5:56:02] szble: ashees maybe in 2030
[5:56:04] tigzie: 2 of my friends are playing runescape again....
[5:56:06] Arsenic_Gunner: You really can’t. If RuneScape can survive, surely so can wow
[5:56:08] theszoti: even if wow is in trouble, all they need to do is to drop a banger expansion and people will come back
[5:56:10] Rudric_Ice: Chrono Odyssey lookin pretty good tho
[5:56:21] Blas0n: @theszoti yep
[5:56:26] SmokedHog: honestly, wow is king - in whatever state it is

[5:56:40] Deathonic: Dragonflight has been a great expansion, but S2 balancing has turned me off from the game for a bit.
[5:56:56] Rudric_Ice: Only phill and Bobby can kill wow
[5:57:04] SmokedHog: ashes looks liek shit lol
[5:57:04] Tornadogenesis: Do you guys think WoW will always remain a subscription based mmo?
[5:57:19] Nerzalus: Blizzard designs bad expansions intentionally to make the good ones seem godly
[5:57:31] Paladuv: WOW was king, but grew tired of their BS. Maybe if they leave out all their BS systems and actually make the tokens go away.
[5:57:38] Rudric_Ice: $70 bucks from dlc
[5:57:41] zacariabac: @Nerzalus xd

[6:00:19] Deathonic: I agree. DF has been amazing and it's killing the haters LUL
[6:00:23] Rudric_Ice: Fuel to the fire
[6:00:26] Shaele: its pretty much 'dead' tbh
[6:00:26] Tornadogenesis: D4? Lulz can't even compare to POE
[6:00:35] Nokterian: we have seen the WoW killers LUL
[6:00:36] Blas0n: every time
[6:00:38] Blas0n: every time 󠀀
[6:00:47] SmokedHog: it has happened about 15 times for me
[6:00:57] Paladuv: Just make a game that do not require you to swipe like it is a fire sale. Spent so many hours in this game. No new expansion this time M8. No tapping.
[6:00:59] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[6:01:11] rhodistar: We always come back LUL
[6:01:13] its_andyd: Often referred to as the epitome of ancient civilizations, the Roman Empire spanned vast territories and lasted for centuries. At its height, it controlled the entire Mediterranean basin and much of Western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. However, a combination of internal and external factors led to its decline.
[6:01:17] Zerohz1: i cant remember how many wow killers we all have tried and they are all gone
[6:01:19] herzlustafir: towCopium
[6:01:45] Tornadogenesis: Ashes will not touch it lol
[6:01:46] CoolioDoom: Even if Wow were crap people would still play it, it's been around long enough to not care. Df ia as you said best Expac they've pulled thus far.
[6:01:47] Rexy95: @Paladuv where in wow do u need to swipe to play other than sub ?
[6:01:51] SmokedHog: the fact is there is no competitor
[6:01:58] theszoti: cant wait for wildstar to come out so it will finally kill wow
[6:02:02] Paladuv: I loved your hype when NW came. To bad it was so broken.
[6:02:02] TheUnknowing: Ashes is a meme at this point
[6:02:08] Nokterian: WoW is my comfy couch i keep coming back
[6:02:20] Sylphy_TV: ashes have to release to actually compete ...
[6:02:21] NaoriMMO: ashes of creation is basically like star citizen, way too overhyped xD
[6:02:39] szble: yep true
[6:02:47] Tornadogenesis: plus wow and ff have a loyal playerbase who have invested a lot of time already
[6:02:51] Arsenic_Gunner: When people hear mmo, they typically think wow
[6:02:51] SmokedHog: wow has the most fluid gameplay
[6:02:55] Skkold: when I get tired of WoW, there's WoW Classic.
[6:02:56] Paladuv: @Rexy95 You need the tokens.
[6:03:05] Andanole: This is the first expansion that I cant quest for renown! I did it in Shadowlands and now I cant bother with it
[6:03:12] pereadin: RuneScape prob gonna still be better than ashes in all reality.
[6:03:18] Nokterian: GW2 is amazing
[6:03:19] Rexy95: @Paladuv erhm you dont ?
[6:03:26] Havykk: I need these other MMOs to innovate so the WOW can yoink the idea and do it better :)
[6:03:32] szble: eso is fun for a bit ill play it like once a year
[6:03:52] Rexy95: @Paladuv learn to use ur professions no need for tokens
[6:03:54] its_andyd: just wait until the metaverse towelliee
[6:04:02] Tornadogenesis: eso is a burnout type game. no direction.. great for exploration and story though
[6:04:28] szble: i like eso's cyrodiil mode
[6:04:35] its_andyd: the riot mmo will let gamers make real world money from gaming
[6:04:43] DemiAragorn: why does everything have to be a wow killer just another good game to play would be fine with me
[6:04:56] SmokedHog: you don't want to plant crops bro
[6:05:10] Pharaoh_326: FoE you heard it here first.  Towelliees new game
[6:05:15] herzlustafir: it was good at the time to
[6:05:19] Tornadogenesis: Guild Wars 1 was still best over 2 imo

[6:05:45] gozzy_mane: im a pretty new player, do people actually make enough gold from grinding to buy there sub for the month? seemed like so much gold to me

[6:07:11] szble: rift was cool
[6:07:17] Zerohz1: wildstar
[6:07:25] SmokedHog: was that the one that couldn't handle the load of the player base
[6:07:31] caluur456: Miss rift
[6:07:51] Blas0n: Do you think Wild star would be more popular if it came out nowadays @Towelliee ?

[6:08:47] Zerohz1: it was so good
[6:08:47] Tornadogenesis: People found out they didnt want a hard mmo i guess
[6:08:59] Pharaoh_326: Wildstar was 9 years ago
[6:09:15] MrGattz: ASTA
[6:09:30] herzlustafir: black desert
[6:09:35] LazerChickenTV: i loved wildstar :(
[6:09:46] d2darkalliance: Lords of the rings had tons off content at launch
[6:10:14] Tornadogenesis: and then the servers went offline :(
[6:10:21] SmokedHog: didn't limit/liquid start on wildstar?
[6:10:23] rhodistar: Why did it die? I can't remember
[6:10:29] Blas0n: ^
[6:10:34] botscast: what exactly went wrong with wildstar
[6:10:37] alluza: how did they ruin it i never tried it
[6:11:10] Paladuv: The production of MMORPG's are about to be revolutionized by the looks of it. The amount of content produced are about to be escalated allot.
[6:11:14] MrGattz: tedious
[6:11:26] Zerohz1: theres a reason we dnt do 40 man raids anymore
[6:11:44] LazerChickenTV: The story, locations, housing, leveling was so good

[6:11:46] rhodistar: yeah okay WutFace
[6:12:01] Arsenic_Gunner: Too sweaty
[6:12:08] alluza: well that explains why it died
[6:12:49] Lorunex: Its a real shame, cause the game it self, played amazingly
[6:12:51] ItsDJDW: you going for the mount? @Towelliee
[6:13:18] Tornadogenesis: Guild Wars did it
[6:13:22] Skkold: Guild Wars 2 is NCSoft, isn't it?
[6:13:25] Tornadogenesis: only one i can think of ncsoft wise
[6:14:05] Tornadogenesis: Guild Wars is just an anomaly honestly.
[6:14:27] NaoriMMO: yeah, guild wars 2 is published by ncsoft, so i wouldn't say that argument stands. but there was basically no marketing for wildstar
[6:14:27] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:14:28] Tornadogenesis: It succeeded because it was unique. The success of game #1 lead to the success of #2

[6:15:09] Tornadogenesis: I think it stands too. Outside Guild Wars, NCSoft games just dont cut it
[6:15:13] Tornadogenesis: In the West
[6:15:14] gozzy_mane: guild wars 2 is a game but the devs dont make enough content for it. raiding shouldnt be dead on an mmo lol. the mounts are sick though
[6:15:23] szble: ncsoft LUL
[6:15:32] TheUnknowing: blade and soul?
[6:15:33] LekeroleN: Blade and soul?
[6:15:38] Thaxus_1974: Lineage?
[6:15:43] Blas0n: GG
[6:15:46] Tornadogenesis: Lineage
[6:16:15] NaoriMMO: it might also be because wildstar didn't really have that much microtransactions in it, compared to guild wars 2? and that might be a huge reason too to why they ditched wildstar?
[6:16:17] alluza: does any1 even play blade and soul
[6:16:19] Pharaoh_326: i loved Lineage 2
[6:16:26] necralia: ppl still pay lineage
[6:16:40] Skkold: because FFXIV uses sub model too, I think it's prob FFXIV
[6:16:45] Skkold: sub gives tons of money
[6:17:57] Tornadogenesis: Lineage went mobile
[6:18:01] Tornadogenesis: so it makes shit tons
[6:18:23] Tornadogenesis: Palia will be the wow killer. Can't wait!
[6:19:04] Tornadogenesis: haha i couldnt even be bothered to make an acc to a closed beta invite ;/
[6:19:07] Nerzalus: WoW 2.0 will be the only thing to kill WoW
[6:19:39] Tornadogenesis: and it wont kill it; they'll transition over to it so its still technically wow

[6:21:23] Paladuv: @Nerzalus WOW 2.0 would be very interesting.
[6:22:11] Tornadogenesis: theyve started slowly but surely.. it just wont be a separate game.. the revamped the beginner zones.. flight is changing to be more dragonriding etc
[6:22:18] Thoreya: They need to delete Aug before WoW 2
[6:22:19] KorbenDallas815: the nft's of WoW2

[6:23:07] Blas0n: @Towelliee I think Aug evoker is cooked as hell
[6:23:21] Paladuv: More like a new from the ground up Blizzard WOW 2.0 game. New history, engine, characters...
[6:23:29] SmokedHog: wish there were more high end comps
[6:23:41] Alienfromger: imagine wow2 with unreal 5
[6:23:41] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[6:23:43] SmokedHog: when you look at the top IO, it's the exact comp for like 3 pages lol
[6:23:51] jkitchin75: @Paladuv never happing
[6:24:11] board4life65: KEKW
[6:24:21] Paladuv: @Alienfromger This would be amazing.
[6:24:30] botscast: bacon POGGERS
[6:24:35] mrnoodlicious: to be fair, support specc is fine, but what they would have had to do is released it with the expansion and also include a few more of them, and go bonkers with 6 people groups. Can't have ONE support char, that will fuck everything up
[6:25:21] xrandomdoodx: RWF in 10.2 will certainly be interesting if Aug stays nearly as good as it is right now lol
[6:25:38] SmokedHog: its the only comp that can run 30s
[6:25:44] Thoreya: They keep nerfing my fire mage man :(
[6:25:44] SmokedHog: have to have an aug
[6:25:45] th30dor: isnt the way forward to add MORE aug style specs?
[6:25:51] Thoreya: Bc of aug
[6:25:53] Melonbrew: It will go the way of the Warrior Gladiator spec @towelliee
[6:25:54] Nebulizer87: It’s still mandatory for M+ those nerfs were light
[6:26:06] Paladuv: @jkitchin75 Probably not. The game is 19 years old though. Ironically enough, the 19 years old classic is hyping so hard compared to retail.... Who know what is in store.
[6:27:05] Haegemon: all Blizzard's core games have all been in-house engines, WoW, SC, Diablo, Overwatch, all custom engines
[6:27:07] Blas0n: yeah next expansion
[6:27:19] Thoreya: @paladuv retail is doing just fine lol, hardcore is alive by like 3 streamers
[6:27:19] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[6:27:26] xrandomdoodx: Wow just needs to realize stuff like PI and external buffs will never be balanced and cause problems
[6:27:31] Haegemon: Hearthstone is like their only non-custom engine using Unity
[6:27:38] TheRealGecika: hahahaha
[6:27:51] its_andyd: xP
[6:27:54] TheRealGecika: is it?
[6:27:58] TheRealGecika: interesting
[6:28:50] its_andyd: LET HIM COOK!
[6:29:05] Thoreya: They’ll nerf fire mage 4 more times before then :)
[6:29:11] Thoreya: Yes I’m mad
[6:30:16] Tubolcain: but will it last for long?
[6:30:23] Paladuv: @Thoreya WOW is trending like 9 percent from its peak. Depends on what you mean about fine ;)
[6:31:23] Blas0n: LMAO
[6:31:26] Blas0n: its going to be banger
[6:31:29] jkitchin75: @Paladuv are folks still playing it yes then its fine
[6:32:09] Blas0n: I'm playing the shit out of hardcore

[6:32:22] szble: fresh classic server would be nice too
[6:32:26] its_andyd: so you're saying more people are subbed to wow because of classic instead of retail?
[6:32:33] Sayryn: LOL True
[6:32:33] alluza: @Towelliee  i supposed it would be ok to watch but for me personally to play any kind of hc game where if you die you die for good and lose your character that just seems like too much of waste of my time more so than i alredy waste my time xD
[6:32:35] Blas0n: LOL
[6:32:44] Thoreya: I mean
[6:32:51] Tubolcain: and video compilation, and then reaction video over it
[6:32:52] Sayryn: React at the start of every stream
[6:32:59] Thoreya: If xaryu is not streaming it who’s watching
[6:33:04] Haegemon: WoW has still always been carried as much by its "silent majority", because for everyone wanting to be salty in a stream or on forums or reddit, there's a dozen who are just enjoying the game with their characters and their friends and not giving a fuck about the drama-llama
[6:33:12] Thoreya: And Mitch time to time
[6:33:43] Sayryn: Guzu
[6:33:54] Sylphy_TV: Did you see it? whatshisface just died bro! YT will love it
[6:34:23] Paladuv: @jkitchin75 Yes, people are playing it. By August estimates, about 1,2 mill. It is a pretty long way from their hey days of about 13 mill.

[6:34:52] Thoreya: And retail streamers have not been streaming bc of TGP
[6:35:27] Sayryn: True
[6:35:51] Yurian33: Asmon is a different beast
[6:36:09] Yurian33: he could stream washing his socks and pull 80k on that channel
[6:36:12] Sayryn: Gingi is all I see
[6:36:32] jkitchin75: @Paladuv but there making more money no game keeps that many playing for ever
[6:36:51] Yurian33: of course Asmon doesnt wash his socks... but i digress
[6:37:06] Paladuv: @Yurian33 It would probably be even more, just by the thought that Asmon would wash anything :D
[6:37:12] Thoreya: dorki and max had 4k each streaming TGP yesterday. its def bc of tgp stuff too
[6:37:41] dracullus: one is more fun to play, other more fun to watch, simple as that (and you can do both at same time)
[6:37:43] Sayryn: I've been playing HC since March. I only came back to retail for a break before Official comes out.
[6:37:52] xpadeDK: is there a clip of you getting tusks?
[6:38:05] Paladuv: @jkitchin75 1/10 of the player base, but still making more money...... I wonder how and why so many left.
[6:38:25] Klarynse: Klarynse subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[6:38:25] alluza: !tusks

[6:39:48] Yurian33: theres no world where a game keeps 10 million+ players for a long time. A 20 year old game holding over a mil is still good.
[6:39:58] Klarynse: dang
