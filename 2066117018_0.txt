[0:18:06] mayfire15: nerf dk
[0:18:33] Everleafxo: nerf dk @MaybeRespect
[0:18:34] MaybeRespect: @mayfire15 You see the comments on Vens new video. People complaining about dk and melee still
[0:18:39] brincubus: @mayfire15 100% dK needs nerf
[0:18:53] ashe91: 1k needles
[0:19:00] brincubus: lol
[0:19:09] juicerjaw: do you think dh needs nerfs ?
[0:19:20] kazekwow: i wish they would implement the cata class/race combos on SOD
[0:19:33] jewish_games_israel: l
[0:19:35] MaybeRespect: 2nd one.
[0:19:36] brincubus: every class should feel as strong imo
[0:19:43] addyz0r: whatever prevents damp 20mins games
[0:19:53] brincubus: high floor = more engagement and p[layer activity imo
[0:19:57] lucksh20: are all quests excatly the same in SoD as Vanilla? or?
[0:19:57] kazekwow: if they nerf dh and rogues, the meta is gonna slow wayyyy down
[0:20:00] Everleafxo: Nerf all melee. Give casters all the power.
[0:20:01] MaybeRespect: DH/Rogues the only melee that even feel good. I think we need buffs rather than nerfs
[0:20:04] addyz0r: rather see oneshots than that
[0:20:17] kazekwow: agreed
[0:20:28] mayfire15: if dh and rogue get nerfed its onto WW

[0:20:41] addyz0r: the stam buff seemed too high imo
[0:20:43] Snohconez: while that would be nice blizzard wont put that much work in so we have to hope for nerfs

[0:33:56] br187x: cause i play in eu when i tried us i couldn't
[0:33:56] LowfadeWOW: echo from SL beat Kawhi like 4-0 with bad ping because home servers went to the loser lmao
[0:33:59] eygton: kinda wild that pro wow isn’t lan lol
[0:34:08] br187x: @mayfire15 i have 80 ms in eu and 180 in us u cant
[0:34:10] eygton: I guess not enough viewers
[0:34:12] morphz____: Yeah that's what I thought. It's not "ideal" but it's the best they can do to offer entertainment while also making the pros be involved
[0:34:15] influx_mushroom: Slungus

[0:34:37] hashtagstronger: Just put a server in the middle of the atlantic 5Head
[0:34:40] LowfadeWOW: yeah so they still ended up doing fine and beating Kawhi LMAO
[0:34:56] Semis394: where did prev play from ? aus?
[0:34:58] br187x: @mayfire15 chan would get 70-100 ping
[0:35:01] HolyPalaTV: HolyPalaTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! yo
[0:35:03] LowfadeWOW: @Semis394 NZ
[0:35:03] br187x: thats pretty solid from 180
[0:35:09] eygton: kinda wild that you can have a tournament online cross with eu in fps with ping you physically can’t do that
[0:35:11] mehhx: guys chan played NA tournaments from australia no eu
[0:35:12] Laythos: sup big dog
[0:35:32] mehhx: ye he had like 250
[0:35:39] decisivedennis: even worse lol?
[0:35:40] br187x: 250?
[0:35:40] mehhx: but these guys were saying he played tourneys from EU to NA
[0:35:41] hashtagstronger: Did Mes ever play from NZ/Australia?
[0:35:45] ilnAU: 150-300 depending where you are in AU and what NA server you connect to
[0:35:46] br187x: 250 is a lot
[0:35:53] Dave_oh: he did live in paris for a bit
[0:35:56] pharmztko: just fly to America
[0:35:57] bleesorc: I think Chan was saying exitlag used to work better but since DF it hasn’t worked as well
[0:36:09] mayfire15: def should be east coast
[0:36:11] mehhx: if the NA tr was east coast would be much better to play
[0:36:24] bleesorc: 100% should be east coast
[0:36:25] hashtagstronger: yea, I play on east coast from EU and it's honestly not that bad
[0:36:35] br187x: they dont pay the awc players flights for the AWC
[0:36:36] mehhx: for me east coast would be like 130 ms vs 200ish on west and its a huge difference
[0:36:39] eygton: I wish wow was popular enough for lan
[0:36:43] br187x: or?
[0:36:55] br187x: 50-100 ms is viable
[0:37:00] br187x: but more then that is insane
[0:37:02] artirie: Wtb lan
[0:37:08] eygton: wtf is blizzard doing???
[0:37:12] Swishinn: LAN would be hype af
[0:37:13] shredder1111: but wouldnt east coast be bad for people on the west? so like if they play on EU server they get horrid ping and if they play on east its bad
[0:37:19] eygton: I bet a lan would bring viewers
[0:37:30] mayfire15: a laned na va eu def getting views imo
[0:37:33] hashtagstronger: Lan hype would definitely gain a little bit more viewers. Whether it would be enough, I have no idea. Lan hype is always more though
[0:37:33] Zacaree55: Chuck i fuckin hate yo ass bro. I was perfectly fine yesterday and you coughed on stream multiple times now im sick as fuck
[0:37:36] bleesorc: lan would prob get more viewers but would it get enough more viewers to pay like 100k in flights and hotels and venue for everyone idk
[0:37:38] Zacaree55: (prob allergies tho)
[0:37:40] sum_x: watching arena from the "spectator cam" is so trash idk if thats an unpopular opinion
[0:37:43] br187x: @mehhx was it 250 ms for chan?
[0:37:55] eygton: like I feel if blizzard cared more about esports comp scene would be so much better
[0:38:02] mehhx: na think chan got 250 to west coast from aus
[0:38:10] Semis394: LAN is extra expense for Blzzard i guess
[0:38:22] vibesham: @sum_x Think that's a fairly common consensus, although they have gotten better
[0:38:24] hashtagstronger: @sum_x nope, it definitely is. It's not a good spectator sport. Compare it to like CS, that's so simple to just enjoy.
[0:38:24] br187x: @mehhx thats very crazy i noticed anything more then 100 is unplayble
[0:38:35] mehhx: yeah its bad lol
[0:38:39] TheEyeVII: it would have to be at blizzcon only but 30k for an esport isn't much, although for an mmo pvp tourney in 2024 it's insanely good & the only one that exists for the genre :)
[0:38:43] mehhx: chan played mage lock tho it was bad ms friendly :)
[0:38:43] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[0:39:26] br187x: is samiyam playing with cdew atm?
[0:39:30] TheEyeVII: are they playing dh rogue incase boomy gets  nerfed or what
[0:39:55] pharmztko: no
[0:40:04] jlaw_89: wow thats amazing how much stuff is on the screen
[0:40:21] Druid_Neminus: @TheEyeVII Think Sam is away
[0:40:28] pharmztko: sam on vacation
[0:40:32] vibesham: this gameplay loop a fw brigns is just sooooo braindead
[0:40:49] Zacaree55: Sam is on vacation visiting Snutz
[0:40:55] Zacaree55: and they think this comp is pretty strong
[0:41:06] TheEyeVII: isn't snutz canadian
[0:41:08] Zacaree55: So they are trying it out to see how it feels.
[0:41:48] FreddyFerrera: prevoker seems so stressful
[0:42:04] FreddyFerrera: its like you lose 1 day of lifespan per round
[0:42:06] mayfire15: you playing 4set?

[5:15:40] vancity99: obviously dont overconsume in vices, proper mindset does wonders
[5:15:50] yami96: i could teabag my keyboard and get the same dps
[5:15:58] Eradivyn: nahh, highest damage in game? definitely not
[5:16:01] Zenlyn: nah cdew man we need to like teach the masses how to heal, after playing shuffles on a dps i agree with all dps players that healing is by far the easiest role  made for idiots HAHA
[5:16:04] Eradivyn: Kappa
[5:16:19] iLLwiLL_HS: It would literally be faster for my to get 2.4 by rerolling to dh which ive never played before than continue playing warr at 2300+
[5:17:25] VitoBambino: it's insane, but tbf I don't think they need that MANY nerfs -- just strong ones. Like if they like blanket nerfed all damage output by 10% and soulscar by literally 40% I think they would be still be the best melee
[5:17:33] VitoBambino: and something for blur idk what exactly tho
[5:17:53] FkPveNerds: wait is that actually all the binds for DH needed
[5:18:25] VitoBambino: yeahh I'm sort of feeling like the PvP devs are checked out but we'll see. Really hope that isn't the case given AWC in 2 weeks
[5:18:34] Zerolol123: there's only 12 of them left

[5:24:05] Solushun: i made a warrior and have been spam facing DHs at the 1700 bracket I feel like i am being punished for poor DPS choice
[5:24:45] saren8: I don't get why its been like this for 3 months and hasn't been touched yet
[5:24:47] Solushun: i dont think its as bad as the retpocalpyse tho maybe its teh cope
[5:24:48] shugguls: @Solushun yep thats why i parked my war, had a triple dh lobby on my war at 2k
[5:25:04] Eradivyn: woah i think i just got your sickness from through my monitor
[5:25:05] Solushun: LOL thats just brutal man @shugguls
[5:25:11] Solushun: spiderman pointing meme with the DHs

[5:25:26] shugguls: @Solushun was a rdruid and a fist weaver, we just ran down the druid
[5:25:47] iLLwiLL_HS: its crazy to me that there is one guy at blizzard, the rogue/dh dev, thats making the entire ladder god awful
[5:26:05] engzyng: these matches cross-region... do you get points for them or what are they for ?
[5:26:07] saren8: all it takes is one little tuning knob turned down a good 10-20%
[5:26:11] EarlyOut: @iLLwiLL_HS Yeah, but he's enjoying it KEKW
[5:26:23] Solushun: nah hes the good dev
[5:26:27] Solushun: everyone else is the bad dev
[5:26:30] brewtank: @cdewx u gonna get r1 shuffle on destro? feel like you have to
[5:26:31] Solushun: they need to catchup to him
[5:26:37] iLLwiLL_HS: but its pure tuning
[5:26:40] saren8: I don't think that other classes should be as strong as rogue / DH are
[5:26:49] saren8: Games would be so short like shadowlands
[5:26:51] shugguls: i wish the alpha would play my class
[5:26:51] brewtank: can the dh/rog dev work on rdru too? we need BUFFS...
[5:26:54] brewtank: @Solushun am i right?
[5:27:04] Drathimos: does hunter even have a dev
[5:27:08] brewtank: KappaCool
[5:27:08] Kydar: it's not pure tuning, it's definitely how the classes are laid out, fully, and classfantasy, rotation, talents, etc
[5:27:53] saren8: Unholy for example had a really good tier set last patch and this one is straight dog
[5:27:53] dooshken: There's gotta just be no enhance shaman dev lol
