[0:08:41] hughjasses: it buffed only base damage
[0:08:47] Kaekias: maybe i missed your answer, if you were to level a shaman. which race would you pick?@Hydramist
[0:08:50] jallaballan: 550, its still good man
[0:08:53] fdaapproved123: so you do same damage with SWD and your dots do more damage now

[0:09:09] jallaballan: its still very good
[0:09:24] ama__deus: Did the patch notes for NA have any surprises?
[0:09:25] Selecktt: SWD weakaura too outdated to be useful now
[0:09:41] snayrofficial: so does it feel more like an execute instead of just a oh look he has 80% health im gonna death him now and see what happens
[0:09:47] snarfqt: is tidal charm in the game?
[0:09:53] wileyecoyoted: are full affli viable for pvp or just destro?
[0:09:54] Kaekias: stun resist is so passive
[0:09:57] prodigy_wow: @snarfqt yes
[0:10:01] Kaekias: tauren stomp mvp anyway.
[0:10:03] jallaballan: damage seems more in line with mindblast, like it should be
[0:10:04] Kaekias: thanks
[0:10:05] hughjasses: i really wish mind spike had a 10% slow
[0:10:14] hughjasses: from the frost dmg
[0:10:22] dramajohns: lol did their fc take berserker
[0:10:45] strange10: void plague nerfed ??
[0:10:59] variawings: we deadge?

[0:11:08] hughjasses: we deadge boys, time to reroll
[0:11:12] hughjasses: it's joever
[0:11:37] Veekayx: sup ryan
[0:12:08] variawings: starfire fine. 1.7k is ok. but sw:d cant hit like a truck. double moral
[0:12:17] hughjasses: been jamming the phonk lately huh
[0:12:27] variawings: dont argue with logic :P
[0:12:29] Evirity: starfire hitting that hard takes set up compared to SW D just takes hitting a button lol
[0:12:32] Diabolikkgg: hydra on NA ?
[0:12:52] hendy619: !bis
[0:12:52] Nightbot: Disco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es4BU1N8Swc Shadow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG_86N-QtnU
[0:13:01] dramajohns: @variawings you need to cast other shit to empower it then cast starfire itself pretty sure
[0:13:18] Diabolikkgg: 1.7 star fire again xDDD
[0:13:43] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:13:45] Diabolikkgg: 40% swd nerf is too much imo 25% would have been good
[0:13:46] Genilort: @Hydramist how is sod pvp compared to wotlk?
[0:13:46] MichelangeloR: yo, howw big will be the impact of the nerf you anticipate?
[0:13:53] MrPoulpp: I would if I could man!!! :D
[0:15:01] khabibsbear: pvp tierlist inc?
[0:15:07] toonits: kek just saw the xaryu deleted clip
[0:15:43] Kaekias: so lad my shaman journey begin hydraLove
[0:16:11] Kaekias: did tauren now
[0:16:13] misstherese: gl ❤️
[0:16:15] prodigy_wow: Hell yeah
[0:16:17] jallaballan: tauren was always best for everything
[0:16:18] dramajohns: does starfire always stun or rng ?
[0:16:19] misstherese: Tauren best
[0:16:22] wowdunni: swd hitting for like 300 dmg less?
[0:16:22] jallaballan: if you can play tauren you go tauren
[0:16:25] prodigy_wow: Warstomp is so good in Pve and PVP
[0:16:26] Diabolikkgg: orc or tauren for pvp
[0:16:30] prodigy_wow: its underrated in pvp
[0:16:31] Diabolikkgg: troll pve
[0:16:32] ama__deus: COnsidering that they need to hard cast, tauren imo
[0:16:35] Masenitox: hi there
[0:16:54] uglynerdling: @wowdunni looks like more than that
[0:16:55] prodigy_wow: warstomp a rogues evasion and Stormstrike him into the dirt
[0:17:04] ama__deus: then again, stuns screw them completely as well, so guess it's hard LUL
[0:17:06] arcane0mage: when you buy blood elf ears irl but no belfs in game hydraT
[0:17:11] Selecktt: Tauren get +15 herbalism. with glove enchant you can get blindweed and ghost mushrooms this phase. nobody else can. This is the deciding factor
[0:17:12] Kaekias: @misstherese thank you
[0:17:15] ama__deus: @Prodigy________________ that is juicy.
[0:17:23] misstherese: guys always Tauren the bigger the better
[0:17:36] ama__deus: 👀
[0:17:46] Kaekias: sadly starting zones are super dead. that was one thing i really liked about hardcore. at least you met ppl leveling.
[0:17:51] wowdunni: rip sp??
[0:17:58] misstherese: or wait now I think of some other thing
[0:18:00] WrightLEG: are you not running VP anymore?
[0:18:05] synonym0us: where can i find the patch notes for the swd nerf? i can't seem to find them anywhere for some reason
[0:18:12] misstherese: I not going to say 😳
[0:18:23] Creampuff1112: new nerfs? i cant keep up tbh
[0:18:42] Kaekias: therese... hydraMindgoose
[0:19:16] rumpadizzle: Class tuning is literally on the front page of wowhead
[0:19:19] kimuratrap4life: How is the nerf?
[0:19:40] zqjii: sod
[0:19:42] zqjii: !sod
[0:19:42] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5swYZYF0UE SoD Deepdive!
[0:19:45] Kapers_: terrible nerf
[0:19:51] Kapers_: class is dead
[0:20:22] Veekayx: lol
[0:20:23] Mystiggo: Burst nerf was warranted, PvE dps nerf was not. Shadow priest scales poorly as well
[0:20:44] jallaballan: why do they scale poorly?
[0:20:55] Mystiggo: Realistically we were able to get almost p2 bis from day 1 with shadow wrath pieces that have more SP than raid gear
[0:21:11] cunderthuntz_: how does death feel now?
[0:21:27] Sinostra: Hey Hydra hydraLeigh
[0:21:33] Mystiggo: yea but 30 dps is ~10% with current dps
[0:21:37] dan_93: is the nerf live?
[0:21:41] whinehouse: !Guide
[0:21:41] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[0:21:44] hughjasses: 30 dps puts us below middle of the pack
[0:21:51] rourfoses: idk seems like it still slaps in pvp at least
[0:21:54] Mystiggo: and 10% is somewhat significant. mages and warlocks already destroy us on the meters
[0:22:09] sansaw12: hello waht lvl do i have to be to playy mythic
[0:22:15] sansaw12: raid
[0:22:30] sansaw12: ait
[0:22:47] jallaballan: atleast your not a frost mage :D
[0:23:08] Kaekias: still good then. not as broken, but still good

[0:23:34] Mystiggo: @jallaballan atm we gain no benefit from crit really. we MIGHT get a rune that allows dots to crit in later phases, not sure yet
[0:23:50] xProloli: my crits went from 1500 to 700
[0:24:10] Diabolikkgg: he got a 60% nerf
[0:24:11] JokiGhostCrew: What's your favourite BG?
[0:24:12] TV_Kuro: Shadow dead confirmed..
[0:24:23] hughjasses: void plague deadge confirmed
[0:24:27] numero5218: have u seen any enhance
[0:24:29] ephixa_fan: hello
[0:24:37] Mystiggo: but pvp wise death still looks great
[0:24:47] Mystiggo: at least we don't take half our hp in lashback dmg now
[0:25:27] Mystiggo: not yet, will go thursday probably
[0:25:30] ama__deus: Banged out #4 in the world on Pummeler before the nerfs, so I am fine EZ
[0:26:11] Nerdyfied: how is the nerf?
[0:26:28] kinglourenco: how does spriest feel post nerfs?
[0:26:40] hughjasses: it's joever
[0:26:41] dramajohns: they are all sitting shadow form lol
[0:26:43] Kaekias: BabyRage
[0:27:01] kinglourenco: i will go ask dakkroth instead
[0:27:13] kallebalik: Priest still S tier?
[0:27:17] ephixa_fan: ephixa_fan watched 20 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! KEKW
[0:27:18] SamAkaforty: 500 hit, nice
[0:27:44] hughjasses: so cringe
[0:27:58] Kaekias: engaging gameplay!
[0:28:02] ama__deus: Good thing mine is 36 already Kappa
[0:28:11] Itrulia: warlock has like what, 3k self healing in 15s without any spell power at 60?
[0:28:36] LumPsis: do you really have enough talents for SL/SL at 50?
[0:28:59] ama__deus: meta still too bursty for them to shine
[0:29:02] Shatteredlol: How do nerfs feel?
[0:29:04] jallaballan: you dont have enough talents for sl/sl at 60 lol
[0:29:09] jallaballan: its for tbc
[0:29:22] kinglourenco: lul
[0:29:22] SamAkaforty: SL + this healing will be nuts indeed, keep in mind we also get death coil
[0:29:41] GrusCS: What are the nerfs? i saw the death, but are there more?
[0:29:41] zaekkyo: Very low damage if you dont play destro build at the moment though
[0:29:46] Sinostra: Yeah, but it's gonna be boring to play
[0:30:03] Sinostra: no way i'm going SL in P3
[0:31:00] rein1715: are the nerfs bad
[0:31:06] Sinostra: How good was compact harvest reaper ACTUALLY ?
[0:31:07] deerobx: What is that 10min CD that looks like the silence icon?
[0:31:07] DG_23: USed it to get out of your fear, so he actually did
[0:31:29] cheza1337: mage s-tier like lock ?
[0:32:00] xaviwoo: best classes atm for pvp?
[0:32:08] GrusCS: boots probably
[0:32:20] flenbober: spidersilk boots?
[0:32:22] deerobx: It gives you a 5sec buff or so that looks like silence
[0:32:30] Sinostra: @deerobqt reaper ?
[0:32:35] esponstef: can you show gear when out of wsg? im staring at ur hp and wondering how :p
[0:32:42] lubetimelary: hows holy paladin in sod? :0

[0:33:29] Sinostra: i think it's a trinket
[0:33:42] deerobx: Ok, ty
[0:33:47] voodoodrop: i rerolled to rogue p2 and i am having the time of my life @Selecktt
[0:33:51] Mystiggo: some games are legit unwinnable even if you go 40-0
[0:33:57] Kaekias: level 4, 10% done Kappa
[0:34:05] deerobx: I don't play WoW anymore so hard to keep track of new things :D

[0:43:41] Gallowxyz: Leave the damage, just give me a tree that's not see through
[0:43:45] Sanitygodx: warriors are gaining basically nothing from raid gear (aside from the axe) pvp wise

[0:45:44] wowjunkie94: @Talgarx priest may have that title with all cds up but without id say they arent broken anymore
[0:47:03] HexedPk: sod pvp is pathetic no room for outplay to much dmg

[0:50:30] Lurifix3n: how hard is it to get dispersion?
[0:50:30] mr_bahama: Is there an addon list anywhere @Hydramist ? Saw your addon for enemy defensives and when they're in range of Death execute and i NEED them
[0:50:47] Kaekias: !ui
[0:50:47] Nightbot: As a 'Thank You' to my subscribers for all their support, my Classc, WOTLK and Retail UI's (addons and settings) as well as TBC Weakauras and Macros/Scripts are now available in a new subscriber channel on my Discord! Go to the Hydramist Discord channel (http://discord.gg/hydramist) and make sure to connect your Discord and Twitch. Note: Connection syncing might take up to an hour.
[0:51:04] Selecktt: The new one is complete. Link is in general chat of discord.
[0:51:05] mr_bahama: @Kaekias thanks!
[0:51:07] Selecktt: Old one is trash
[0:51:19] F3scorn: @lurifix3n get the quest shared with you and then it’s just running around. maybe a death hop or two.
[0:51:35] F3scorn: hardest part is getting the holy water cause the naga are high lvl
[0:51:50] Selecktt: New one has a custom texture. I can probably quickly throw together something using a default icon if you dont have the texture.
[0:51:50] F3scorn: but they don’t block the water spawn point.
[0:52:01] calugarul: link to that WA?

[1:33:03] dansho: What about 2 dots, Blast/Death, 2-3 Spikes and Blast?
[1:33:07] Shatteredlol: @Hydramist I think you have to down second boss in order for the grimes to spawn
[1:33:15] F3scorn: do you ever use mine flay in the rotation? like with twisted fate rune?
[1:33:22] MVPeteTV: if you blast first u can get dots up and 3 stacks before next blast is ready

[1:34:55] MVPeteTV: precast spike into blast then dots should be good then
[1:35:11] f1gu: @MVPeteTV think some of the parsing spriests are running Twisted Faith over Void Plague due to fast kill times, so Pain is prio.
[1:35:11] My_keI: kinda crazy yall cut that hunter who was with you guys every gnomer so far cuz some of the ppl in your raid are massive pussies that dont have a single competitive bone in thier body @Hydramist

[2:13:40] Fakedtv: hunters blow everything out of the water on every boss

[2:13:44] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist

[2:14:14] LesGoTV: we will, with gear
[2:14:15] Sammah0: it corrects for it after a couple weeks I think
[2:14:15] daLuhz: my favorite thing about parsing is intentionally making poor choices to get a poorer overall result but a higher number lol
[2:14:18] LesGoTV: but as of now its shit
[2:14:25] daLuhz: not hating it is what it is
[2:14:38] Fakedtv: just checked my logs from last raid, and they all got reset to a 0 parse somehow even tho i was 95 average
[2:14:52] durtybob: is the shaman tanking

[2:15:59] LesGoTV: what rare farm?
[2:16:02] Kant_lol: anyone can tell me what type o damage mind spike is? is it shadow?
[2:16:18] wowjunkie94: shared pain is great for this wing as well
[2:16:33] zugmadonk: @Kant_lol its shadowfrost, it chooses to be either shadow or frost depending on the targets resistance
[2:16:40] wowjunkie94: i just predot while grp is forming on tank
[2:16:44] Kaekias: @Kant_lol shadow and frost i believe
[2:16:49] Fakedtv: i swear sear is bugged, it doesnt do a single tick until halfway through the channel
[2:16:54] snayrofficial: i just got dc'd
[2:17:00] LesGoTV: 2-3 shared pain is ideal, cuz if you start too early you´ll overaggro = more dmg waiting 2-3 globals
[2:17:28] Kant_lol: @zugmadonk @kaekias so if i buy shadow damage gear it will work on it right?
[2:17:43] zugmadonk: @Kant_lol yes

[2:42:49] ronke420: did some1 moved rogue from druids group lol
[2:42:54] kevinrmp: i just realised mind spike sound effect is the seed of corruption detonate sound effect
[2:44:04] Zevioi: The servers are dying outside instances
[2:44:17] dominozxx: I used to like the old cata spikes, 3 spikes then insta cast mb
[2:44:27] Vetto_7: @NovacloudxD So If I am rank 3, I need 450 kills to get rank 5 right
[2:44:30] dominozxx: pop archeangel and hit someone for 100k
[2:44:43] letsgetgoingyo: i think its cool they made a new animation for mind spike. Instead of copying retail
[2:45:02] an_average_music_producer: thank you for killing the crusade seasonal server. cant log on now lol
[2:45:03] saliusfxd: top 3 best rolls

[2:47:26] xBONGLORDx: for pve its 2 - 4 buttons
[2:47:28] xBONGLORDx: pvp it isnt
[2:47:43] bannerwow: @Scoffered You located in EU or NA?
[2:47:45] letsgetgoingyo: raptor, flanking, carve. But its mostly a pve spec, in pvp youre still a wheelchair warrior without charge
[2:47:46] an_average_music_producer: letting in the streamers in crusade server through ip tracking is crazy
[2:47:49] prodigy_wow: but they kill our bosses SeemsGood
[2:47:58] Mystiggo: there's a really nice addon for runes called 'Engraver' btw. Looks just like your weakaura but has functionality like easy swapping of runes

[2:50:09] kevinrmp: imo rogues shouldnt even have aoe, since they should be bis single target dpses
[2:50:28] lasagnalord13: you can do this with 2 ranged
[2:50:32] daLuhz: @kevinrmp you could just increase the threat mod
[2:50:33] Unbound_Entity: believe me, ill give you shuriken toss to do surv hunter dam. lol

[2:53:53] an_average_music_producer: no idea why its down, i think over population. stormwind has like 300 players there

[2:58:11] prodigy_wow: RIp didnt matter
[2:58:17] jared1991z: wasnt quite a 99
[2:58:20] Selecktt: You sure 3 stacks of mind spike is the move? Mind blast is up before third cast. I would think getting out 30% more mind blasts is better than 30% more crit.
[2:58:39] f1gu: melee zug zug brain
[2:58:47] Ricweedx: Isnt 1 group moving up and down better for dps?
[2:58:51] an_average_music_producer: what a fold lol, only 5k hp

[3:30:58] BeryTurnOn: @forsale1312 on retail its combination of auctionator + craftsim
[3:31:00] Selecktt: polished Gears are only like 10g. not really worth it. only good if you happen to get a munch of tarnished gears. the filament is the money maker.
[3:31:03] bannerwow: Game is still cooked for me
[3:31:06] Roccox2xx: @Hydramist whats the addon showing the values on your abilities in green called??

[3:47:32] bambucha34: i find gnomer way more interesting than bfd

[3:50:39] Qrucials: Hydra can you check meter for how much damage the aoe lightning thing does. Not the chain
[3:50:43] swingler93: so what do melee do for arc?
[3:50:50] snayrofficial: im NA and get back in fine
[3:50:52] mylittlehombre: if you get the arc do you move away from the group ?
[3:51:08] NovacloudxD: You can just have one group stand still and the other group move up and down. Thats how i've done it
[3:51:14] garmok1979: if you're furthest and take the hit, it bounces to 2x nearest and all 3x of you get marked?
[3:51:17] Mystiggo: @mylittlehombre no you have 2 groups and you stick with your group. it chains to 2 people closest to you
[3:51:19] swingler93: so if tank gets AoE guess offtank steps in?

[3:52:15] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[3:52:28] Mystiggo: @mylittlehombre if you take 2 chain lightnings in a row. which is why the 2 groups alternate who gets it
[3:52:33] Qrucials: Im thinking essentially - everyone is max melee, if you have debuff you move "into" boss. If you dont have debuff you go back into max melee. No need for groups, no need for anything else

[3:53:26] Qrucials: That's why i asked about the thing where you move out, because I think you can just ignore it completely
[3:53:35] Minikuznitsel: Whats the addon that tells you the Dot timers on bosses and mobs?
[3:53:37] bigsharkieboi: If you have everyone on one siode of the boss, you can have the lightning field thingy on the other side still in melee range
[3:53:56] Selecktt: People really overcomplicate this. Two ranged groups. group 1 takes first arc. then moves in. Then group 2 takes arc. Repeat until boss is kill.
[3:54:18] jokaa199: 1 middle camop and 1 grp run back in for it
[3:54:25] Minikuznitsel: Someone told me you can FAP the knockbacks, dont know if thats true
[3:54:42] Qrucials: nah it shouldnt cause problems but it does make it more annoying, makes melee have to move out sometimes depending on comp, makes all range have to move more losing damage
[3:54:55] Mystiggo: Easiest way to do this in theory: 2 ranged groups stand still at equal distance. Both groups have 1 designated person who takes a step back every 2nd chain lightning
[3:55:01] Mystiggo: and everyone else just stands still
[3:55:21] daLuhz: @Qrucials this is the simplest way to do the boss if people really struggle. it turns it into a 1 sentence strat
[3:55:43] beastnotwest: Are you playing Login simulator? LUL Kappa

[4:03:45] Kaekias: shadow strike and you are in melee range xD

[4:04:33] stickiriikii: who do you think is the best 1v1 class in duels / 1v1 wpvp?
[4:04:46] mylittlehombre: they need to remove the gcd on shadow step for starters
[4:05:18] mylittlehombre: shadow strike

[4:07:07] Odhirion: only 5/5 in spirit tap?
[4:07:12] xaar94: give them cloak at 50 and complete the joke
[4:07:20] mylittlehombre: yes good point . also rogues never use shadow strike as it shares a slot with mut
[4:07:36] Selecktt: not this phase. maybe next phase. Deep prot for pvp looking nice p3
