[0:18:54] FpsNovaa: Shroud I missed a day of work just to chill here DatSheffy DatSheffy
[0:18:57] kokomellon: Smore Challenging

[4:48:38] Komly: that is not being a "greedlord" that is knowing how to make money as a creator
[4:48:41] nautilus209: And yes you should get it for free, to answer your question. No worl was put into it
[4:48:47] Komly: yeah
[4:48:51] Komly: never start a business :P
[4:48:53] nautilus209: And that isnt creating anything
[4:49:14] nautilus209: Tjhe people who created WA are the creators. Everyone else is a user
[4:49:27] Komly: ask atrocity how long it takes him to make a weakaura package for every class/spec/dungeon/raid
[4:49:31] Komly: and keep it updated
[4:49:37] hikazey: Is the the breaking bad number?
[4:49:38] Tetsu: @nautilus209 Lol if no work was put into it why do people want it. If someone has the skills and expertise to make high quality WAs theres nothing wrong with them charging if they want to

[7:04:47] elenix6: i wish retails raids were this hard
[7:04:50] OddM4nOut: this is the run
[7:05:05] eskodas: @shroud he went in to the animus spawning under 10% and after the animus dying when you switched back he was almost at 20%
[7:05:19] jakethesnake117: retails raid are sooooooooooo free 4head
[7:05:28] merlinthedrifter: i dont know why people like this game. the combat was bad when it came out and no voice over for text was already starting to become outdated back then
[7:05:39] smunglese: Kappa
[7:05:40] jakethesnake117: :3
[7:05:44] JafferFGC: @elenix6 isn't classic notorious for being easy?
[7:05:52] ObooRS: it is
[7:05:59] MrPink604: will the ranged figure it out today?
[7:06:01] jakethesnake117: i like he was joking

[7:06:05] JafferFGC: my bad
[7:06:16] jakethesnake117: yea man read the room 4head
[7:06:28] jakethesnake117: who the fuck am I
[7:06:43] PurityV2: @elenix6 the fights are just solved, retail is definitely harder now but if you compare the time it took to down some of the bosses from vanilla - wotlk then you can say that classic is harder
[7:06:46] PurityV2: its just perspective
[7:06:55] frezq90: rip the faithless dude
[7:06:56] DastanOMEGAZULUL: big 🌰 dmg

[7:07:48] OneLoneHermit: don't focus on that though, focus on the boss and get it done.
[7:07:48] halfchubstrangler: they can clear trash without you
[7:07:48] Pr3d_FPS: that is hm Mode ?
[7:08:03] xavior334: LUL
[7:08:18] jakethesnake117: no i mean like in older versions of the game raids had less mechanics so its just easier
[7:08:24] Mogsor: it's the classic's fault for not clearing an easy raid as expected. not your fault
[7:08:25] pumperDink: i had this problem too, quitting retail solved all my problems
[7:08:27] TheWindyPixel: sub to shroud
[7:08:30] Fzoul6: raid just needs a hard end time with no extends.  It's just the way it is.
[7:08:33] reddevil_am: just kill 4Head
[7:08:34] Beurken: @pr3d_fps yes
[7:08:37] zev319: clearly get max in here to raid lead ulduar
[7:08:42] Twigberrybdld: you have a schedule, noone should be upset except if you are breaking the planned schedule
[7:08:43] UpsetTheSetup: jacob's fault
[7:08:44] OddM4nOut: are you skipping the next boss if you kill this guy?
[7:08:44] shin_hong: the problem of  addicted KEKW
[7:08:55] captainflarp: @shroud you don't stay at work longer because your coworkers mess up. You leave on time and go to the next place.....
[7:08:56] beardinprogress: good
[7:08:56] HinesOh: Respect retails time and leave this raid?
[7:09:05] lolJax1: classic>retail 100%
[7:09:10] TheWindyPixel: is easy lol
[7:09:11] tdslater: retail pretty good right now
[7:09:12] pumperDink: yea tough call atm, but not doing both is the play i think
[7:09:19] zeeeBREH: retail much more fun now.
[7:09:22] Cliev1: holy delay on spell casts, what is that like 200+ms
[7:09:22] Armani1Xp: At this point you need to give the classic Raid a realistic time frame
[7:09:30] Pr3d_FPS: @Beurken thx
[7:09:35] DougTheApache: you actually like retail better this time around?
[7:09:47] dvelop_: No shame in saying raid time was over 30 mins ago and moving on
[7:09:57] steazydeag: catJAM
[7:09:59] OddM4nOut: they are watching threat too they need to take it easy
[7:10:09] Leosaix: Is it just me or does Shaman healz feels super bad in retail?
[7:10:10] reddevil_am: tarikDance tarikDance
[7:10:15] GalasaZamn: Wings is really low cd since are rotation is smaller compared to other classes
[7:10:20] club420: ha
[7:10:33] sotamieslarboss: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[7:10:35] OneLoneHermit: @Leosaix I've seen a few people say that. I'm not too sure on it myself.
[7:11:00] duragoppa: I like retail a lot more now. I didn’t enjoy shadowlands whatsoever, but I’m having quite a bit of fun exploring Dragonflight by myself since I haven’t joined a guild yet.
[7:11:19] Leosaix: @Leosaix Just had one in my key run and I was not impressed
[7:11:24] imdaddii666: Love the ambient music
[7:11:37] merlinthedrifter: i dont know why shroud doesn't play 76. it's more in his wheel house. plus it's a new modern mmo that changes the mmo game. it's not as polished as when wow first started, but thats because it's the first new take on mmo's
[7:11:39] Yareb: Are shaman heals doing crazy dmg with the acid rain tho?
[7:11:45] ImJstaMrTaco: most annoying this about this is ppl are dying to shadow crashes
[7:11:52] jakethesnake117: Shaman isnt the best but they just got a few buffs and they are great in raid... just not great in M+
[7:12:11] jakethesnake117: but they are still good
[7:12:13] Lynkz7: !charm

[7:12:14] RipZyzz1: @Leosaix doing +20 keys as shaman and being 7/8 mythic with it its not as strong like evoker or resto but its "ok" and playable
[7:12:18] eskodas: Oof they healed him a lot during animus
[7:12:18] jakethesnake117: so if u like Shaman play it :D
[7:12:27] RipZyzz1: resto druid*
[7:12:32] JandroMura: Whats a retail raid?
[7:12:49] Leosaix: @RipZyzz1 OH ok, wasnt sure if it was the player or the class. cool
[7:13:04] uhomer9030: luk
[7:13:05] krestus214: i always what the designer was smoking when they made this boss. it's not bad but super unique, they don't make weird stuff like this anymore

[8:16:07] hotdoqxz: Never thought I could read my own message in shrouds chat because I used to watch him in Prime Pubg times haha
[8:16:17] xypher337: true thatg
[8:16:23] wayslay: They got second this tier. They have had a couple wins in the past two years. They are very good and he basically started what the big guilds do by raid leading thier team while not even being in the raid. It allows him to completely focus on the raid and make call outs
[8:16:28] ithinkgin: FeelsOkayMan
[8:17:39] Purple7776: @wayslay That's crazy, that feels lame for some reason
[8:17:53] hotdoqxz: @itzgriiinch there’s also “Echo” an EU world first team and the biggest/ only real contender to liquid, method and bdgg are trying to but nowhere close

[8:19:02] Cripple__: @nambakorea
[8:19:07] mycho_: yea hes sick
[8:19:07] wayslay: @purple7776 there is a lot at play in world first behind the scene max is obviously good enough to raid. But keeping your cool and raid leading the progression is very impressive and max does it the best imo
[8:19:15] hotdoqxz: @itzgriiinch well yea because of all the drama happening all method players are playing for echo now, basically echo is method and new method is all new people
[8:19:15] cptwow90: bdgg is part of echo right, they did collab streams
[8:19:25] Paytah: @shookiecookietv great contribution SeemsGood
[8:19:52] itzgriiinch: @odynxoxo They have a full new roster now? Didn’t know that
[8:19:55] ShookiecookieTV: I mean no hate just wondering.
[8:19:56] wayslay: @odynxoxo yes and bdgg is essentially echo in NA
[8:20:04] Purple7776: @wayslay Yeah that's fair

[8:21:05] greger6969: why isnt max streaming

[8:53:14] JafferFGC: @LionButLeon guild wars 2 came out later than both wow and FF and it has action combat in a hybrid sense, it also innovated in how questing works

[8:55:26] hikazey: I believe it
[8:55:28] lavisnen24: Waiting for blue protocol doesnt flop

[8:55:34] sonnedaviking: what is osrs?
[8:55:36] keylowx: @shroud ele shamen buff worht it now?
[8:55:36] Jimmo_TV: osrs looks like it was made in the 80s
[8:55:36] LionButLeon: perma updates = modern YEP
[8:55:38] Esidion: @letranger123 LMFAO I only played on private servers but that shit is so old now.
[8:55:42] hikazey: EQ is my dad and his groups mmo, I played it for a bit, but man
[8:55:52] ForSureTrent: wait does ff14 have tab targeting?
[8:55:53] JafferFGC: osrs is modern PogChamp
[8:55:54] LionButLeon: @keylowx the buffs did not help eles weaknesses so no
[8:56:01] ihavemydoubts: @kissmeazz old school runescape
[8:56:09] letranger123: @Esidion yeah it was criminally pay 2 win, private servers were fun though
[8:56:12] MaxGrandpre: @keylowx Ele feels much better now, but enh is still vastly superior if you can play it correctly
[8:56:15] LionButLeon: Adge
[8:56:16] owl_nite: What's modern day combat system?
[8:56:23] JafferFGC: @NotTrentFPS yes
[8:56:33] ryano_: @owl_nite it's personal preference
[8:56:43] Esidion: @Esidion Gpotato in general was criminally p2w man. Awful company in general.
[8:57:01] nisabee: wow combat and controls just feel fluid and responsive
[8:57:23] JafferFGC: @nisabee yes, but it has been for the past 20 years
[8:57:32] PuffyStudMuffin: There is no "best" mmo. Play what you enjoy and go take a shit in the toilet not in twitch chat...
[8:57:42] owl_nite: Is New World combat system modern?
[8:57:44] LionButLeon: FF14 ads KEKW
[8:57:45] niemo89: is thsi mythic or heroic?
[8:57:50] ryano_: @niemo89 mythic
[8:57:51] hikazey: FF14 is a good mmo
[8:57:52] nisabee: just because it's been 20 years, doesnt mean you need to change for the sake of change
[8:58:00] niemo89: ok ty
[8:58:07] JafferFGC: @nisabee you don't but it doesn't make it "modern"
[8:58:20] Avavavavaaa: Where is max, why isn’t he leading? Sick?
[8:58:20] peanuttfl: 10 hr stream 😏
[8:58:21] Myumyuh: WoW got 20 years of experience in MMO, so modern got that negative connotation in my head
[8:58:21] JafferFGC: it's an old concept, doesn't mean it's bad
[8:58:56] MrPink604: FFXIV honestly feels better to me on roller
[8:58:58] nisabee: compare jumping in wow to any other mmo, just feels totally different
[8:58:59] Arccali: Roblox mmos are the modern ones
[8:59:00] Landarokz: Snapshot mechanics are very unintuitive
[8:59:09] JafferFGC: ff14 feels like you are playing on 200 ping
[8:59:11] YungBeepBoop: samurai in ff14 is the most fluid class in any mmo
[8:59:12] Jimmo_TV: YEP 100% agree
[8:59:14] merlinthedrifter: @owl_nite i know some of the answer, but i wouln't mind talking to someone to help on the rest
[8:59:21] Mageoxx: gameplay in wow and the feel of using your different abilities makes it great
[8:59:23] YungBeepBoop: wtf it looks amazing??
[8:59:23] LionButLeon: ff14 combat is yikers
[8:59:27] adamjwick: its cheesy af
[8:59:31] sazgu: random question what bags do you use? do you have a lot of space
[8:59:31] Margekhu: does some1 know what happened to the upgraded warmode vendor?
[8:59:32] Fugeki: I heard talking about dps gets you banned in ff @shroud

[8:59:34] metroboomer52: @shroud how u liking dragonflight?
[8:59:41] onesix: ............
[8:59:42] Esidion: How long have you been playing WoW
[8:59:42] hikazey: I think they've had longer to work it out
[8:59:45] IDecayl: @YungBeepBoop shadow bringers was 100%, I miss kaiten sadge
[8:59:50] Gatmayn: !talents
[8:59:50] StreamElements: @Gatmayn We don't currently have his talent/build info for WoW Dragonflight.
[8:59:52] thegummibearmassacre: Dragon Flight Pog
[8:59:53] Nekz3: i play every game on 60 hz Sadge
[8:59:56] emeraude824: Hmm hmm hmm hmm
[9:00:05] iiamBaro: true
[9:00:13] Soproatlol: wow is such a good game. People need to appreciate it more.
[9:00:15] Ragnodar: yeah but you cant be a feral druid in ff14 so whats the point
[9:00:15] RerQ: Same can't stand ff14 for same reasons
[9:00:17] Arccali: Minecraft mmo’s are the modern mmo’s
[9:00:25] NickTheMailMan: WoW with Lost Ark animations would go HARD
[9:00:31] eightiesz: ffxiv to wow feels like the difference between cs movement and overwatch movement
[9:00:35] Esidion: This looks like so much effort, man.
[9:00:38] ForSureTrent: I play a gladiator but i don't know much about the game because I just started like a week ago
[9:00:42] Esidion: I really couldn't.
[9:00:45] hyphestus95: samurai and ninja are so fun to play
[9:01:20] gmarcobeats: @hyphestus95 whats samurai and ninja?
[9:01:30] eddier0y: monk is hella fun
[9:01:36] Chakragod: Yeah the fluidity of WoW was always one of its best aspects compared to other MMOs...the casting, the movement...so much nicer than most
[9:01:36] Esidion: @gmarcobeats Japanese warriors
[9:01:50] YungBeepBoop: i personally LOVE the combo system in ff14 and i really enjoy the way it looks. But wow def has better features to make it last longer. if ff14 had a mythic+ system though i would probably switch to it full time.
[9:01:51] hyphestus95: ffxiv classes @gmarcobeats
[9:02:08] Darkicross: Monk is like playing wow
[9:02:09] YungBeepBoop: sadly they said they wont make a m+ like system
[9:02:12] merlinthedrifter: @Chakragod really i think it's bad
[9:02:19] gmarcobeats: @hyphestus95 cool, im new to this expansion, i played vanilla as a valor set warrior
[9:02:19] sol4r_420: !twitter
[9:02:19] StreamElements: @sol4r_420, https://twitter.com/shroud
[9:02:31] kappapapaaa: @jonnyeehaw going in ngl
[9:02:33] JafferFGC: @Chakragod what are you comparing it to merlin?
[9:02:40] gmarcobeats: @Esidion cheers
[9:02:46] JafferFGC: because tab target mmo wise, it's the most fluid
[9:02:49] summitschairbutsentient: looks like a tough fight
[9:02:52] spaycee_: !prime

[9:03:07] owl_nite: @owl_nite There is nothing wrong with tap target, just interested to know what ppl think of Elden Ring and New World style combat as modern
[9:03:09] gmarcobeats: anyone here remember valor set for warrior
[9:03:09] Chakragod: @Chakragod I dunno, I've played a lot of MMOs and it always felt the best gameplay wise.
[9:03:23] dl_sepehr: As a ff14 player I agree with that aspect of cripsiness , I Also play blackmage wich has the slowest rotation imo . But they made it so much better with everypatch. Like instant cast spells thrown within rotations in endwalker
[9:03:34] scifrhafes: we lost shrud to world of warcraft noo
[9:03:50] Hex404: seems like markers matter
[9:04:03] nova1god: What do you think about Throne and Liberty ?
[9:04:11] nisabee: gameplay is just different between wow and other action games like elden ring
[9:04:11] Esidion: The fuck is this, a geometry lesson?
[9:04:21] MrPink604: Aware
[9:04:26] Icedxylophone: Hey, what is the Star wars code?
[9:04:28] migg3y_: @Esidion IKR hahaha
[9:04:38] Notiicee_: is evaccreatives legit?
[9:05:12] nisabee: tab targetting gameplay is more about your own character's rotation and controls, meaning more complex player gameplay rotations
[9:05:21] Esidion: How long have they been at this???
[9:05:38] kantoFB: i like this game
[9:05:38] JafferFGC: @nisabee I'd say black desert online has complex rotations
[9:05:41] merlinthedrifter: @Chakragod well i've play a lot of eso and 76. both look better. i also play a lot of single player games. some of the mechanics are in this game too, but have added a bit more seasoning
[9:05:42] Icedxylophone: None knows the code? :D
[9:05:45] JonnDaniels: honestly
[9:05:56] itsquetzy: Do you like the difficulty design of mythic?
[9:06:01] chickentendos: monster hunter is my favorite mmo
[9:06:05] Redsamx: imagine m+ as action combat, trying to cc n interrupt
[9:06:17] LionButLeon: jesus no
[9:06:17] nisabee: they are just two different types of gameplay, no point trying to say one is objectively better than the other
[9:06:26] deekseverywhere: @Icedxylophone go into vod and look above his webcam, i don remember i
[9:06:35] JafferFGC: @nisabee I don't think anybody is though
[9:06:35] sanjiro_cs: i dont understand this game at all
[9:06:44] Esidion: @sanjiro_cs Join the party bud
[9:06:58] Paytah: @merlinthedrifter you ok bud?  You need a hug or something?
[9:07:06] JafferFGC: nobody is saying tab target is superior to action mmo or the otherway around
[9:07:17] YungBeepBoop: tab target is king in mmo but there are a few action mmos that are fun just not challenging
[9:07:24] merlinthedrifter: @Paytah do you have a question about video games
[9:07:28] MrPink604: Destiny 2 is my favorite mmo
[9:07:34] kyaeds69: @shroud are you waiting for Riot MMO?
[9:07:44] Paytah: @merlinthedrifter not for you
[9:07:51] Esidion: Speaking of Action MMOs... Does anyone remember Vindictus?
[9:07:58] imMikeyAngelo: So i'm looking around but i'm not sure... Does wow have a 1 year sub option?
[9:08:01] kurod_: @Esidion best combat ever
[9:08:03] merlinthedrifter: @Paytah ok then why are you talking to me
[9:08:18] Couladin: Wow does have a 1 year sub option I'm like 99% sure
[9:08:22] dl_sepehr: @Esidion It's on steam now lol brings back memories
[9:08:28] wayslay: @immikeyangelo  yes one year sub is a new thing
[9:08:33] Paytah: 6 month sub
[9:08:38] Gingeranajones: yes it does
[9:08:38] JafferFGC: @YungBeepBoop any examples?
[9:08:42] partypants1133: one year sub is gone again, yeah?
[9:08:58] hikazey: where'd the jams go?
[9:09:02] just9n: i told you this shit would happen
[9:09:05] Esidion: @Esidion That game was like... revolutionary as an MMO when it came out lol. My Compaq computer didn't stand a chance...
[9:09:07] hikazey: Stretch break baby

[9:10:07] Vernash_: ulduar gear ilvl is so high atm, it will get so much easier

[9:10:18] metroboomer52: its clssic 10 man 25 man
[9:10:19] yung_pringlle: whats up handsome
[9:10:19] cinavarrete: oof even then.  that's a lot of raiding
[9:10:29] luceedx: 10hr ulduar KEKW
[9:10:30] dl_sepehr: Raids are so much time and brain consumption
[9:10:35] Vernash_: TEN? not eight?
[9:10:37] deathcrier: I would die
[9:10:39] nisabee: ulduar KEKW
[9:10:40] caravainilla: dump classic
[9:10:41] Vernash_: ten in 25 on classic?!?!?!
[9:10:44] Dreadlol: ulduar clears will get faster, but at the start yeah it's a lot
[9:10:45] Myumyuh: wait, what?
[9:10:48] just9n: i forsaw this thats why i opted out of mythic raiding
[9:10:56] notriagaming: I always feel like classic wow is like Parkinson's Law where it could be completed so much faster but I always feel like im wasting time in there. I do still think its fun though where I like to just do classic bosses one time then drop it
[9:10:57] just9n: i knew it would have growing pains
[9:11:00] Chompsy: Can't be bothered reclearing ulduar again KEKW imagine doing that for another month or so while getting no light for guildies PepeLaugh
[9:11:04] TheLilBr0ski: if theyre doing HMs then i can believe it
[9:11:08] Icedxylophone: @deekseverywhere thx it was OGGDO BOGGDO! :D

[9:11:13] Lucy_Frye: Iam getting carpal tunnel just listening to SHroud
[9:11:19] MrPink604: Does Ulduar HMs just require your entire raid to do it correctly? No tolerance for individual mistakes?
[9:11:24] GHOST_Drxpyyy: HEY SHROUD
[9:11:29] metroboomer52: @just9n u were soo good though, its just ulduar came out

[9:12:42] Couladin: Having to balance playing retail and classic, I just think one has to be ditched
[9:12:49] Hatch_NZ: whats more fun for you
[9:12:57] nisabee: playing retail and classic is just too much lol
[9:12:58] just9n: we would get most of that place done

[9:13:03] Lucy_Frye: Hire a coach. A gaming Guru to show you The Way of the Game.

[9:14:26] housed: raiding without set times and days is just creating drama for people who want to degen and others who dont
[9:14:29] AlphaSimply: Yeah, you need cutoffs, maybe 2 nigths a week for prog
[9:14:30] Vernash_: people's brains start frying after 4-5 hours rading
[9:14:31] MrPink604: soni just wants to game
[9:14:33] hikazey: You need to put a personal limit on classic raiding if it's interfering
[9:14:36] wrath_of_kekz: its not a game at that point, its a job
[9:14:42] hikazey: Play less for longer?
[9:14:43] Esidion: @jimsabortion What does this mean?

[9:21:02] MrPink604: he was listening to shroud's rant about ulduar

[9:24:38] artttietv: gg shroud gl on the rest
[9:24:40] topiibansen: WQhat says bro money yes but WOW is timeless bro ... -_- who doesnt want to talk to a ReddishEarGirl bloodelven race share some blood to bond their races?
[9:24:59] LionButLeon: ?? o.o

[9:57:16] station_deimos: @sogrubegroj_ it looks boring but once you literally know the meta-you’re hooked
[9:57:21] Inline66: This guy sounds so mad
[9:57:34] merlinthedrifter: @RhYnO_69 what do you mean by that. i dont like raids cause evryone becomes to picky and have to make a cookie cutter build
[9:57:49] gfhluck: this is probably the least cookie cutter wow has been
[9:57:50] Heartspark: This sounds like a job than actual fun
[9:57:52] martinezdev: lol
[9:58:07] merlinthedrifter: @gfhluck well then it's old
[9:58:21] sogrubegroj_: @station_deimos damn if i only get payed for playing WOW then all in.
[9:58:34] NeroSvx: i felt like blizzard scam me on this game somehow
[9:58:48] xswtchx: is the trun!
[9:58:50] gfhluck: nah bro just do sales in wow and you get to scam blizzard and buy blizzard games using wow gold
[9:58:51] station_deimos: This game has Devs like amfr!!
[9:58:54] sogrubegroj_: Warcraft 3 for me was a biggest scam
[9:59:05] ibraehiem: how can an adult enjoy this game
[9:59:07] DopexSora: i have no idea whats going on
[9:59:10] Crazyb1ade: This fight is very difficult, looks not to crazy from a spectator perspective but this fight is a lot to deal with.

[10:00:28] NeroSvx: i never touch diablo since i saw someone spending 1mil dollar on that p2w game
[10:00:28] sogrubegroj_: almost dead
[10:00:39] VincentVanGoat: "I don't get how an adult can enjoy WoW. Why don't they play a real game with real things like guns where you shoot other people like Call Of Duty. That game is for adults because it has my favorite things like guns and shooting and veterans and war and guns." haHAA
[10:00:49] FaelOttoni: anyone know which WA set he's using for the cds and stuff?

[10:01:41] finagler_: play warzone
[10:01:50] Foxfire7732: its a tank mechanic
[10:02:01] fizzis_: that happens when no tank in range
