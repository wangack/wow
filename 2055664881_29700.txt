[9:40:48] detectivechud: he was trying to give you cash at the house because he was going to do it there....
[9:40:51] Thomsan04: people keep saying "notarized" like you dont have cam's legally binding signature
[9:40:51] IronLion_55: notarized means you have to both sign it in front of a notary person like a lawyer

[9:42:51] Naboo69: Gary can you take your mask off too savixOld
[9:42:55] fyisic: Its 100% powergaming to give cashier your cash while held at knife point,
[9:43:02] Thomsan04: i love the OOC drama leaking in  xdd
[9:43:04] wowitspeter: @daredevil_rx once gen x is fully running it
[9:43:04] snejpen: @Daredevil_rx MONKA im his generation
[9:43:05] Kota216: you cant talk to a lawyer ina court house with a MASK on come one lol
[9:43:08] Kota216: its common sense
[9:43:12] wowitspeter: OMEGADANCE
[9:43:20] IIIIllIlll: Kappa
[9:43:27] AlexSamaAU: @fyisic is it not powergaming to rob a guy where security should be in a bank
[9:43:35] Thomsan04: technically not a mask.  bandages from plastic surgery
[9:43:43] rtb_ryan: @alexsamaau no…
[9:43:48] ODBDaspecialist: its powergaming to shove cash on someone no? and meta timing the running in ..
[9:43:51] M1sterRZ: KEKW
[9:43:58] Techno_Plumber: Power gaming to give him cash when he told him not to and graycen couldn't refuse it.
[9:44:16] HavingFunWrong: nice RP potential tho for lawsuit arc no?
[9:44:25] Daredevil_rx: @snejpen so? also what the fuck does that first word mean?

[9:44:34] Marks0nn: well it started with $1k….
[9:44:37] Kota216: have fancy do it
[9:44:42] detectivechud: giving him 100,000 cash in the bank when he should have just transferred is power gaming.
[9:44:46] Techno_Plumber: You got a good case at least. it'll be entertaining
[9:44:54] rtb_ryan: @detectivechud no it’s not stop saying that
[9:45:00] Thomsan04: i mean all the proof is in gary's phone and bank statements
[9:45:02] OZZIDA: the cops already know? does that matter
[9:45:03] cdman_77: you'll need to push the fact that it was agreed he would put the money in your account but he he forced the cash on you
[9:45:07] Sazaruna: yes, lawyer doesnt have to be truthful about it or even mention it
[9:45:27] Marks0nn: you didn’t even get to check your pockets
[9:45:28] Trodenskjold: Gary never said to transfer it
[9:45:33] rainbowninjadefi: tell the fucking lawyer exactly what happened or you will lose
[9:45:35] HeroTrip: he threw the cash at you seconds before
[9:45:38] nPayn: yYES
[9:45:41] rtb_ryan: chat throwing serious accusations for no reason just enjoy the roleplay
[9:45:45] AlexSamaAU: lol he threw the cash and bolted

[9:45:51] HappysFunPalace: @rtb_ryan it kinda is, can you put 100k in someones pocket irl?
[9:46:08] Thomsan04: verbal agreements especially with witnesses can probably hold up pretty well in this
[9:46:09] Techno_Plumber: You got a lawsuit for a setup. Get your cash it'll be good RP
[9:46:11] nPayn: @rtb_ryan you are literally clueless
