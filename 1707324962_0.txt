[0:21:53] Tiikiibob: Well thanks man I was just wondering. however I sit at 97% mastery. should I look in to any other brake down in gear that might help more?
[0:22:01] SilkeySmooth: removing a double tap from mm hunter is liek removing wings from ret its bad

[0:24:13] SilkeySmooth: try it before its nerfed
[0:24:25] Klako1: i love bm in solo
[0:24:43] Dane_kek: I only have 1 level 70, it's so expensive to gear more than 1 LUL
[0:24:47] Fefefar: @Swifty Overall, from the very start of WoW - what was your most enjoyable 6 months of playing?
[0:24:50] SilkeySmooth: bm is better in solo shuffle imo
[0:24:53] ibejake: I'm more scared of bm hunters
[0:25:00] ibejake: mm has very avoidable damage.
[0:25:20] Tiikiibob: MM does not

[0:25:43] TY_Dunston: surival is for sure the best spec. People just like easy. Sur has high skill cap
[0:25:51] spysy_na: Pretty sure hes saying that you as the enemy can avoid the damage from an MM hunter
[0:25:57] wildhazze: Just do a 1shot macro n u good ^^
[0:25:57] Dane_kek: What's your most geared class currently?
[0:26:03] ibejake: ^
[0:26:11] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:26:37] rpivs: How goes the grind?
[0:26:52] ibejake: You see double tap, defensive. Sort of like avoiding ret damage, see execution sentence / seraphim, defensive.
[0:26:53] Tiikiibob: well it seems like for mm trying to avoid there dmg once they see you for a sec is impossible lol
[0:27:41] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty

[0:28:22] wonderwaffle407: me too I got 5 as well, grind 15k honor leveling then u just buy all the gear at 70 feels good
[0:30:07] Silvestina: A quick thing about the honor gear. It's 340 at level 1 and 366 at level 5 but in both cases 411 in BGs. So why am i upgrading this? Just for world pvp a bit? Outside the contested territory.
[0:30:10] Klako1: @wonderwaffle407 leveling in bgs?
[0:30:11] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:30:35] killiannl: @SilvTheGnome upgrade is for PvE only
[0:30:41] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:30:43] killiannl: so openworld pvp stays at 411 aswell
[0:30:51] ibejake: Most burst from MM is double tap, trinket, volley for explosive shot proc, rapid fire.
[0:31:26] Silvestina: So if my pve gear is over 390 i'm better off not using it outside
[0:31:52] ibejake: I like survival more for sure.
[0:31:58] SilkeySmooth: the mm hunter problem is volly explosive shot not double tap
[0:32:25] ibejake: idk double tap is pretty busted.
[0:32:41] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty

[1:53:23] moktaz: I am sure it's a lovely island. I would just be scared of how often it gets hit by hurricanes. Seems like there are more and more. Maybe the time between just seems shorter as I get older cause the time between is a smaller percentage of my overall life time.

[4:33:26] AnguishTM: @kostchie np
[4:33:41] 187prooof: i only get 2950 xp per mob here
[4:33:43] Silvestina: are those mobs level 70 or 60 to u?

[4:34:02] 187prooof: they dont scale
[4:34:06] Shaggy19931: dont let blizzard find out tho
[4:34:07] Navis85: @Swifty do you still use the elgato pedals? are you happy with them? im thinking about buying one myself.
[4:34:36] Hasoufel: so 6 mobs are about 1 bar of xp . do u get any rep from it ?
[4:34:41] Silvestina: this is nuts, i thought using first craft for professions is fast
[4:34:45] SSD511_: Take advantage they will nerf this zone next patch
[4:34:46] Silvestina: but this....
[4:34:49] Sweet_Lou__: Yea it certainly seems to be the fastest way but it did get nerfed. You gotta tag the mobs now instead of just standing nearby :(
[4:34:50] illusivebyrd: so you just tag mobs?
[4:34:56] highfy96: you do actually you have to stay dead though do not release and youll get xp still then release when there all dead
[4:35:02] highfy96: i did this yesterday
