[0:07:14] cashthb: hey, windwalker... or mistweaver, whatever - monk is a banger!
[0:07:47] Se7enthSinn: I would pat $500 for that AH mount. I will Blizz would put it in the Shop
[0:08:00] Se7enthSinn: wish
[0:08:31] Jinxyourit: hey your guides are the only way I got AOTC for castle nathria, thank you.

[0:09:07] saga_no: .....I shouldn't be allowed all this luck........
[0:09:18] J_Trinta: I was just watching your youtube video lol
[0:09:29] cashthb: I have a low-key sore throat so to stop it from getting worse I've been eating garlic and honey all day long... I think I got my own dream breath - but it actually puts people to sleep instead of healing them
[0:09:46] DestinamueGaming: hello
[0:10:21] saga_no: So - I haven't played WoW since before Christmas, right? Logged in today to check out the new content, and queued for the event dungeon on a whim. ...the dang Love Armor dropped
[0:10:25] saga_no: First attempt.
[0:10:57] GreenArrowed: g!
[0:11:00] GreenArrowed: and gg!
[0:11:02] saga_no: Apparently - the ultimate meta move is to *not play at all* for like 2 months....
[0:11:04] nyrhalahotep: "No book is really worth reading at the age of 10, which is not equally ~and often for more~ worth reading at the age of 50 and beyond." ~ CS Lewis
[0:11:07] Ujai321: you really did make your frames huge
[0:11:35] wolfcloudchaser80: Ugh, just like my partner. Gets that first try, I still have no armor, no rocket.
[0:11:54] cashthb: oh yeah, speaking of youtube videos, I noticed you didn't want grim batol mythic, is it because you hate FUN?
[0:12:09] saga_no: I was equally obnoxiously lucky last year with the rocket - 3rd attempt
[0:12:13] Ujai321: you mean you are great at losing your DPS
[0:12:16] ayedq8_: pvp hazel wow
[0:12:21] wolfcloudchaser80: She's also the one who ran ICC with me on a whim and I hear "Invincible? I just got that, what is it?"
[0:12:32] saga_no: Tried doing the Gilneas storyline today too - and ...whoo boi I AM RUSTYYY... LUL
[0:13:11] saga_no: So I've been baby-leveling the PvP toon mostly today
[0:14:00] saga_no: Speaking of: You need a certain PvP ilvl to queue for Solo Shuffle, right? Can I obtain that by doing non-rated BGs or is there some other magic I need to investigate?
[0:14:00] Se7enthSinn: I wish they will come out with Comp Stomp Arena
[0:14:01] Ujai321: i dont love having to buff every round
[0:14:04] cashthb: you're welcome :)
[0:14:48] cashthb: @saga_no no, nonrated bgs are the fastest way of getting it
[0:15:07] saga_no: LIke run a bunch of BGs for honor or whatever currency, and then crank up the ilvl with gear from the vendor?
[0:15:20] Grasshoppa117: hello
[0:15:20] Fredde253: wow that BAM sound is really loud, makes my ears bleed
[0:15:27] saga_no: Not even my main is high enough ilvl to queue for shuffle, lol
[0:15:30] Grasshoppa117: whats this mount ur farmin mam and whats the chieve for it ?
[0:15:30] cashthb: @saga_no you might wanna do some superblooms or something to get your crafted gear going tho
[0:16:04] Neltalie: ya the bam is a bit loud :D
[0:16:08] Ujai321: you should watch ellesmere's stream sometime
[0:16:18] Ujai321: to make you feel better about not wanting to bother us
[0:16:20] sence_00: morning Hazel, I hit 1600 in shuffle - I think we're addicted
[0:16:25] Grasshoppa117: gotcha thx
[0:16:34] russtrotter: keep the bam to your liking... your hide is on the line in SS
[0:16:46] Grasshoppa117: havnt played pvp in ages
[0:16:50] sence_00: scared Im going to wind up in match against you if these keeps up tho
[0:16:53] saga_no: @cashthb Well, yeah - obviously - ....but the bits that aren't crafted I could get from the vendor with honor (or whatever) from the vendor?
[0:16:56] honeybun_games: loving the hair today!!!
[0:17:26] cashthb: i don't think it's loud, if something I think it's weirdly quiet compared to the music
[0:17:33] saga_no: Mind you - the pvp-toon is currently lvl11 ...so like this is far ahead in the future - I just wanted to understand what I need to do once I ding 70 to be able to start shufflin'
[0:17:34] cashthb: @saga_no yes
[0:18:07] sence_00: leavers are so demoralizing, I was about to finish a game 5/1 and someone bailed :(
[0:18:26] FriendsOfWumpus: Your hair is lovely :) <3
[0:18:32] saga_no: So; get to lvl70, do a bajillion unrated BGs for honor, get ilvl up enough; SHuffle until I turn blue in the face
[0:18:53] Cyberwolle: Cyberwolle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:18:53] Streamlabs: cyberwolle just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:19:09] sence_00: haha the competitive spirit in me would never throw a match like that
[0:19:10] GreenArrowed: yes, battleground blitz has been great
[0:19:14] GreenArrowed: and it's really fun and fast
[0:19:22] GreenArrowed: but i love bGs
[0:19:22] sence_00: oh noes
[0:19:24] zannuss: rip
[0:19:29] Grasshoppa117: how hard is it to level a hunter or mage? im used to leveling by blasting dungeons on healers
[0:19:31] Jinxyourit: comp stomp when they have it.
[0:19:31] saga_no: Yeh - I'll probably just do all the PvP stuff I can find just to get the ilvl up
[0:19:33] Varezhka8: I can wait for rated BG blitz, will be such a better way to get the mount
[0:19:35] cashthb: @saga_no it's like 2 epic bgs if you win them & can finish their quests, it also gets the conquest rolling
[0:19:45] saga_no: Once I ding 70, that is
[0:19:47] GreenArrowed: @Grasshoppa117 hunter is super easy/fast
[0:20:03] kynlaeh: i played 3 solo shuffles yesterday and 2 out of the three someone left the last round
[0:20:26] Grasshoppa117: do i jst gota quest? i mainly do dungeons to level worried abpout q times lol
[0:20:26] sence_00: idk I feel like warriors are really good at line of sighting me
[0:20:36] J_Trinta: Isnt easier to get the mount on 3s?
[0:20:41] GreenArrowed: @saga_no i basically spam BGs until i get enough honor to get a full pvp set
[0:21:27] saga_no: @GreenArrowed Yeah - like I said, not even my raiding main is high enough ilvl to queue for Solo Shuffle LUL
[0:21:29] sence_00: LOL
[0:21:34] Neltalie: am warrior, can confirm :D
[0:21:39] cashthb: I hate melee lobbies, it's really demoralizing when you run up to a guy to punch it for that juicy holy power and it hits back!
[0:21:41] Neltalie: thats how i feel
[0:21:42] sence_00: yes
[0:21:44] kynlaeh: i have a hard time healing arcane mages, why the teleporting everywhere behind every possible pillar, i can never find them
[0:21:49] Hitmonjeff: oh totally, use to play warrior and i charge everything
[0:21:52] saga_no: Good thing is that I can start jumping into unrated BGs from lvl10 onward so I can get a decent chunk of honor to spend on gear
[0:21:58] GreenArrowed: i'm VERY bad at line of sighting on my hunter bc i'm just so used to being super mobile
[0:22:13] cashthb: dhs are way-way-way-waaaaay more likely to los me
[0:22:17] sence_00: I like the jungle comp
[0:22:22] GreenArrowed: oh yea, and my lock
[0:22:25] GreenArrowed: teleport everywhere
[0:22:47] GreenArrowed: i also forget i'm not actually immortal on my warlock
[0:23:27] voidmuse: yeah boomie!
[0:23:47] cashthb: frost dk?
[0:23:51] saga_no: Leveling a priest is so bizarre; like with heirlooms on and like half-paying attention to the Apothecary dungeon thing earlier... I topped the dps charts (knowing I absolutely do not do that on my main)
[0:24:15] kynlaeh: i dont see much affliction warlock mainyl destro
[0:25:22] cashthb: aug?
[0:25:58] erinnightz: erinnightz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Happy 25 months hope you been having a good weekend so far hazelWave
[0:25:59] Streamlabs: erinnightz just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:26:15] kynlaeh: i play shadow but besides me i dont see many
[0:26:51] saga_no: *points to self* ... I will be a s-priest pvp punchingbag
[0:27:04] saga_no: with mayhaps the occasional disco for funsies and clownery
[0:27:17] russtrotter: managed to watch most of last week's cup 2 of AWC and it was fun to see shammy healers and DH's.. seems like they've been out of meta for a while
[0:27:18] cashthb: I feel like I see a lot of shadows, maybe just lingering nightmares from last season
[0:28:03] cashthb: might have been first season, whatever
[0:28:05] jeffdmk: BAMN!
[0:28:46] jeffdmk: bamn is my favorite part of the stream
[0:29:04] russtrotter: i keep thinking of that scene from "Stepbrothers" movie where Will Ferrel asks the guy "are you saying pow?"
[0:29:08] Lee57King: Hi Hazel
[0:29:23] Vareska11: hello, what rating are u playing?
[0:30:17] shadowsnake1961: shadowsnake1961 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:31:00] shadowsnake1961: hazelTen
[0:31:02] comemorning: hi
[0:31:19] Neltalie: OMG
[0:31:20] GreenArrowed: oh woooow
[0:31:21] GreenArrowed: a classic
[0:31:22] Neltalie: thats my favorite movie
[0:31:25] saga_no: The OG one with Alicia Silverstone?
[0:31:26] Daemavand: I have also never seen it lol
[0:31:29] Neltalie: ive watched it 50+ times :D
[0:31:29] russtrotter: aaaawwww snap, clueless is my jam...
[0:31:35] DilanaLynn: I watched that one a LOT.
[0:31:44] Neltalie: whyyyyy the ending so good
[0:31:45] saga_no: It's one of *three* "girly" movies I like
[0:31:50] jeffdmk: spoilers lol
[0:31:54] Neltalie: hmmmmm xD
[0:31:56] GreenArrowed: i mean, it's based on emma
[0:32:05] Neltalie: its a biiiit gross maybe xD
[0:32:06] TotallyNotRaien: emotional incest?
[0:32:06] LilyOfTremere: I've never even heard of it x)
[0:32:10] Neltalie: trueee
[0:32:13] finnybae: SUS
[0:32:14] TotallyNotRaien: ewww
[0:32:15] Petricorpse: "You're a virgin, who can't drive."
[0:32:23] saga_no: The 90s were a different time, indeed....
[0:32:32] GreenArrowed: blonde paul rudd
[0:32:35] seadub: oh honey
[0:32:37] seadub: they were
[0:32:45] TotallyNotRaien: scary thought but they were 30 years ago
[0:32:49] russtrotter: ha! from my perspective, i always cheered for Josh since he's like the first dude in history to escape the friend-zone
[0:32:50] panoramicsdruid: The 90s were 25 years ago...
[0:32:53] saga_no: Gurl. The 90s were 30 years ago...
[0:33:01] cashthb: weren't you a weeb? that's pretty tame in anime standards afaik
[0:33:08] GreenArrowed: i do wish someone would continue the trend of poppy parodies of classic lit
[0:33:28] GreenArrowed: @saga_no oh god, don't remind me
[0:33:36] Neltalie: @saga_no BibleThump say it aint so
[0:33:50] saga_no: I'm an 80s baby so most of my childhood was in the 90s
[0:33:52] comemorning: i am reminded that the 90s were 30ish years ago because my youngest was born then
[0:34:20] saga_no: The 90s were pre-internet for the vast majority too, so ...semi-stoneage in that sense
[0:34:22] GarbageM4n: @comemorning I am 30... mom?
[0:34:50] russtrotter: Rudd must be up to some clean liviin (or he's got the one ring of power) because he hasn't aged a day
[0:35:08] saga_no: @Neltalie I dunno what to tell ya... I was 10 years old in 1994... LUL
[0:35:15] jeffdmk: @saga_no depends on when in the 90s late 90s people did have internet
[0:35:39] cashthb: @jeffdmk I didn't!
[0:35:45] comemorning: @GarbageM4n  i could do with a son, but towards the end of the decade i became a grandmom too
[0:35:46] saga_no: @jeffdmk Yes - but not everyone had internet at home until the very end of the 90s; and even then it was kinda rare
[0:35:51] DilanaLynn: Dial-up internet yikes.
[0:35:57] GarbageM4n: @comemorning congrats!
[0:36:17] comemorning: thanks
[0:36:30] russtrotter: if you were in any kind of engineering or science college degree then you could have been on the nascent internet (usenet, gopher, FTP lists, etc) all pre web stuff
[0:36:34] comemorning: weird times indeed
[0:36:46] GarbageM4n: i was at 1700 rating on my warlock before i have been taking a break on WoW and I am dreading queuing back up to get 1800
[0:37:02] jeffdmk: @saga_no I would disagree with rare in the late 90s. I would not say common but someplace in the middle.
[0:37:19] wolfcloudchaser80: This talk of age now has me wondering if I'm the oldest person here.
[0:37:27] GarbageM4n: but i need the full set D:
[0:37:31] GarbageM4n: but youre absolutely right
[0:37:38] GarbageM4n: well said
[0:37:39] saga_no: @jeffdmk I can assure you - ... in 1998, when we got internet at home, I was one of the few who did in my class.
[0:37:47] russtrotter: @wolfcloudchaser80  i will crush you my agedness!
[0:37:58] saga_no: Out of 30 kids, only like 5-6 of us had internet at home that early on
[0:38:15] Daemavand: I admire your dedication to this goal of grinding the mount
[0:38:34] witchhobbit: you have to be at 1800 for the elite set?
[0:38:42] wolfcloudchaser80: I was born in '80, but I'm immature at heart!
[0:38:42] GarbageM4n: how many pvp addons do you use? my friends told me about probably 10 but I never got any
[0:38:50] comemorning: all 1960 vintage raise your hands 🙋‍♂️
[0:38:55] russtrotter: agreed, it takes some special thick skin to grind through lots of SS lobbies
[0:38:55] cashthb: @haleych yup
[0:39:09] saga_no: @jeffdmk by the time 2000 rolled around, most people had gotten internet at home - but in 97-98 not many did - at least here
[0:39:11] russtrotter: @wolfcloudchaser80 you are not the oldest one here :)
[0:39:35] HazelNuttyGames: !addons
[0:39:35] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[0:39:45] jeffdmk: @saga_no The numbers i found give 20% with internet at home in 1997. I guess this boils down to if you would consider this rare.
[0:39:48] Jinxyourit: they need another solo shuffle tournament.
[0:39:50] gitz2: your hair grew fast :O
[0:39:51] Terra___l: @saga_no which country did you lived back then? cause i had 96 internet like most others in germany
[0:39:53] wolfcloudchaser80: @russtrotter Ok then. It hasn't happened.... YET.
[0:40:09] saga_no: @JustIAron Norway
[0:40:14] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:40:14] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:40:18] sence_00: juke?
[0:40:21] GarbageM4n: huge. thanks for the sheet!
[0:40:29] sence_00: ahhh
[0:40:37] Ratcult_: How come such audio delay, is it airpods or something
[0:40:52] GarbageM4n: thats why precognition is so strong @sence_00 very skillful pvp trait
[0:41:01] saga_no: @jeffdmk 20% sounds about right, and I would indeed consider that rare; mind you - 20% of people had ACCESS to the internet - not necessarily a internet connection *at home*
[0:41:15] cashthb: @jeffdmk that's seems way too high for world wide number for me... keep it in mind I was born that year so I'm going by assumptions
[0:41:24] wolfcloudchaser80: This is.... almost Foreground Cat.
[0:41:30] saga_no: I had access to the internet from 1993-94 because my dad had internet at his job.
[0:41:37] GarbageM4n: I don't think its called precognition but that was what the Warlock PvP talent was called
[0:41:39] saga_no: Limited access - but still access.
[0:41:52] GarbageM4n: its a garnishment
[0:41:53] Unwashed: That's an amazing wig, you can't tell at all
[0:42:17] GarbageM4n: did you dye the wig yourself? it is very YOU haha
[0:42:33] padakins: twitch should have cat section
[0:42:40] jeffdmk: @cashthb @saga_no I should be clear that was the us % of households with an internet connection number.
[0:42:45] eielwind: i slowed down so much at like 75%, i just gotta finish
[0:43:09] witchhobbit: if the pvp sets upgrade your ilvl in bgs/arena, do you need to bother upgrading them?
[0:43:11] russtrotter: is this wig a new sub goal version or going back to the one before the last sub goal?
[0:43:28] dandeneaux: New pvp change for vault is so nice
[0:43:41] saga_no: @jeffdmk Yeah - and here in Norway - having an internet connection *at home* in 1998 was still relatively rare, but very much becoming the norm.
[0:43:49] GarbageM4n: @dandeneaux whats the change?
[0:44:09] cashthb: the big affro? :O
[0:44:25] TotallyNotRaien: would you ever wear some crazy party city wigs for funsies?
[0:44:25] dandeneaux: You will just get conquest instead of getting gear
[0:44:25] cashthb: yet!
[0:44:27] GarbageM4n: @haleych only if you want to use them for pve
[0:44:38] ahnn112: MoP music was so good for what lol
[0:44:40] vampire_enthusiast: With the current wig, your channel icon is accurate again
[0:44:45] dandeneaux: so you dont have to pick between pve and pvp gear
[0:44:49] kynlaeh: maybe green like your legion era (or somewhere around there)
[0:44:51] GreenArrowed: love a headband wig or a wig with bangs.
[0:45:13] GarbageM4n: @dandeneaux that is so good. that is in WW?
[0:45:22] MajGhostPants: He is a fiend that is skinny? lol
[0:45:22] GarbageM4n: @doggydooper uhhhh lol
[0:45:24] necr0me0wcer: @doggydooper bruh
[0:45:27] dandeneaux: S4
[0:45:36] saga_no: @doggydooper Yeah nah - ...I don't foresee that happening
[0:45:44] GarbageM4n: what are they making the third vault row in s4?
[0:46:00] sence_00: @doggydooper wtf
[0:46:06] witchhobbit: innocence? lmao
[0:46:09] TotallyNotRaien: is this the 1st time ive heard her curse and its by accidently misspeaking someones name?
[0:46:10] GarbageM4n: okay this guy is trolling just ban him lmao
[0:46:11] sence_00: troll
[0:46:39] witchhobbit: LUL
[0:46:44] dandeneaux: @GarbageM4n The vault for pvp will just be conqeust for if you get a full cap you will get alot of conquest
[0:46:49] saga_no: Let's see if that does it or not
[0:47:03] Unwashed: Vengeance DH in Arena :o
[0:47:32] jeffdmk: @saga_no The norway number i found is 22% had access to the internet in 98. I wish there was a connections at home number. Anyway it is interesting to look at the number.  I guess I would only use rare if something were under 10%ish
[0:47:53] witchhobbit: nope lol
[0:47:54] saga_no: There we go.
[0:48:09] GarbageM4n: @HazelNuttyGames I know you dont get too deep into M+ but do you have interest in MDI at all?
[0:48:22] Daemavand: @saga_no ty!
[0:49:16] saga_no: @jeffdmk I consider it rare because in 1998 cellophones/mobile phones became the norm for *everyone* as well, and given that  - 22% with access to the internet (likely most of that through work) would be rare in a small but very technologically advanced country
[0:50:13] saga_no: And when I say everyone, I mean literally any one aged 13 and up could and usually would get themselves a cheap cellphone with a prepaid card
[0:50:18] sence_00: oh I didnt realize that was a tank DH
[0:50:32] sence_00: games with tanks are soooo slow
[0:51:02] GarbageM4n: ive never seen tank dh, i saw a few blood dks this season
[0:51:10] daws001: the love rocket mount dropped and i can't stop staring at it. so pretty HypeLove
[0:51:21] GarbageM4n: Yeah I knew you got 20s just not like super grinder like some other WoW creators
[0:51:32] sence_00: theyve improved the MDI format a bit this time
[0:51:49] saga_no: I enjoy watching the MDI.... I loathe doing keys myself LUL
[0:52:40] jeffdmk: I just did a google search for forged documents because of a wow achievement and now that will be in my search history!
[0:53:21] rtsplanner: rtsplanner subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 42 month streak! 
[0:53:21] Streamlabs: rtsplanner just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:53:25] eielwind: still no love rocket for me this year :(
[0:54:26] GreenArrowed: nice
[0:54:40] cashthb: bb o/
[0:55:37] wowfreshman: thank you for removing the “bam”.
[0:56:17] jeffdmk: it is still here
[0:56:37] dandie64: does hazel post her transmog info some place?
[0:56:41] kynlaeh: last xpac i saw this priest pi the warlocks Tyrant pet and it pumped hard on the dmg
[0:56:49] emergence_fi: PogChamp
[0:56:54] dandie64: i need the boots
[0:56:56] HazelNuttyGames: Evelyria - Lightbringer
[0:57:11] dandie64: thanks
[0:57:20] alisoninaisle10: hazelWave hazel and hazel enjoyers
[0:59:00] WeemoVR: I know its not what its saying but I keep hearing either "Saul Run" or "S'alright" lol
[0:59:30] jeffdmk: does anyone have any experience farming the pterrordax egg?
[0:59:35] jgbrit: Hi Hazel, just watched this week's news video. Oh man am I pumped for the hearthstone mount!
[0:59:37] WeemoVR: Its a Yanny/Laurel thing oh no
[1:00:06] kynlaeh: its like a warlock dot that lets them drain life from multiple targets to heal
[1:00:25] saga_no: Shopping - and then Love Armor attempt
[1:00:31] saga_no: Friendly reminder ;P
[1:00:36] Blueofthenightfall: You won 4 and got 8 rating man thats rough
[1:00:50] jgbrit: I'm in work for another hour, have a great stream. Catch you later hazelWave
[1:01:30] alisoninaisle10: I was climbing easily then hit a wall because i havent gotten better gear since like the start of the season
[1:02:07] alisoninaisle10: all i want is wins for the mount now
[1:02:22] cashthb: they should go back to the early df numbers where I lost 500 rating for a 4:2 game
[1:02:23] J_Trinta: What's battlemender?
[1:03:02] saga_no: What's the highest rank title you can get?
[1:03:26] saga_no: Impossible Lofty Goal set LUL  (for me)
[1:03:54] cashthb: it's easy, just be better than anyone else
[1:03:55] saga_no: Flabby is Flabby - tru' dat. I did say impossible... ehehehe
[1:03:56] WhippWhapp: o/ Happy Saturday!
[1:04:01] Daemavand: Flabby needs no description :D
[1:04:07] 7thSaga: tasnPEACH  Hiyo Hazel and Chat!
[1:04:11] Daemavand: Flabulator?
[1:04:23] 7thSaga: jimblesPoke
[1:04:44] saga_no: What rank do I need to be Gladiator?
[1:04:58] sm00kie2: ooh loving the hair today
[1:05:04] Eirchi: Hi Hazel! Floyd here now!
[1:06:07] Perkolate: SL ratings were insanely inflated
[1:06:38] saga_no: Hm.
[1:07:25] saga_no: And the rating/rank is per *type* of PvP, right? So if I get above 1000 in Shuffle, I'd still have to grind out 1000 in say 3s? (do both contribute towards the mount bar?)
[1:08:54] sence_00: @saga_no yeah, different ranking but all contribute to mount
[1:09:57] galdrelvolkfire: Hi Hazel!!
[1:10:02] galdrelvolkfire: Love the wig!
[1:10:03] GreenArrowed: loool
[1:10:12] Eirchi: 2400 is roughly International Master strength in Chess
[1:10:20] TravelTheSkies: just got the x-45 mount :D
[1:10:35] saga_no: Oh ok - cool - I thought the mount grind was character specific
[1:11:10] Daemavand: getting there!!
[1:11:22] Daemavand: Best class, you're gonna win now!
[1:11:27] eielwind: did you do your love armor attempt
[1:11:35] saga_no: She did, yeah
[1:11:42] wolfcloudchaser80: I kinda enjoy the PvP streams because it's something I just can't bring myself to do on my own.
[1:11:58] J_Trinta: Is it worth to do the big dig more than once a week?
[1:12:05] GreenArrowed: very spinny shuffle
[1:12:15] jeffdmk: if you did not have the mount how many attempts per day would you put in?
[1:12:47] Aronim1980: Love the Hair
[1:13:09] alestrom23: lol heard the whistle and thought i was playing the my druid, use the same WA
[1:13:38] furiforever: Did it mute for anyone else?
[1:13:55] furiforever: nvm my side
[1:14:05] accio_coffee: Not for me
[1:14:15] GreenArrowed: i'm v good at LOS my healer in this map
[1:15:32] jawea: I finally after 12 years got the rocket 3rd day this year but armor will evade me another 12 years even though I’m tryin 21 times a day
[1:15:45] saga_no: OK now I feel bad...
[1:16:31] jeffdmk: That makes me feel worse
[1:16:41] Eirchi: There's armor now?
[1:16:46] averageteacup: Today was my last chance to get the rocket this year, of course i did not get it
[1:17:17] jawea: it is but why blizzard has to do it to us like that blows me away lol
[1:18:06] jkuhl58: @averageteacup love is in the air continues to monday
[1:18:53] Eirchi: Love, exciting an new, come abord, we're expecting you!
[1:19:17] jawea: the looove boat
[1:20:13] averageteacup: @jkuhl58 There will be next year too :D
[1:20:24] cashthb: @SickSickSix atleast 3
[1:20:35] GreenArrowed: i always forget
[1:22:35] saga_no: If you reach rank thresholds - can you dip below those again?
[1:22:38] sence_00: I have 5 games left til the mount and wow should I take a break but...sooo close
[1:24:37] jeffdmk: That would be so mean to take it away
[1:24:56] saga_no: Imagine having to grind out the mog every season if you dropped rank..... Oof.
[1:25:07] saga_no: Like - the SAME mog...
[1:25:25] Arinyx_Tv: peepoHappy i love your style and content
[1:25:59] Zuldak: I mean, if they threatened to take away rewards people would grind to the rank and then just stop playing to protect their rank
[1:26:33] saga_no: Or the rank-booster black market would go absolutely insane
[1:26:48] Eirchi: Hazel, will you be playing the new Super Hardcore mode?
[1:27:12] instagib2: what addons do you use for pet battels btw?
[1:27:22] saga_no: !addons
[1:27:22] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:27:31] saga_no: It should be in that list @instagib2
[1:27:40] Zuldak: Hardcore Hunter
[1:27:57] Perkolate: SSF hardcore streamathon
[1:28:00] Zuldak: Hardcore Hazel Huntrr
[1:28:02] jawea: classic?
[1:28:04] J_Trinta: Why don't you PVP with a priest?
[1:28:05] GreenArrowed: love classic troll
[1:28:09] Zuldak: sadly no race starts with an J
[1:28:10] Zuldak: H*
[1:28:15] GreenArrowed: cross roads is frustrating but man
[1:28:23] cashthb: don't play it safe, play it rouge!
[1:28:36] jeffdmk: play shaman
[1:28:39] Daemavand: ahahahaha
[1:28:56] cashthb: warrior armor tanks, rouge dodges, it's way more thrilling
[1:29:10] Daemavand: I'm not gonna do self found but I do wanna get back into HC
[1:29:27] Daemavand: naaaaaaaaaaaah
[1:29:28] Daemavand: lol
[1:29:40] jeffdmk: are you tempted at all to go back and get 60?
[1:29:50] GreenArrowed: they just zoom all over the place
[1:29:56] saga_no: Bing-Bong-Baa
[1:29:57] Daemavand: I wanna finish the levle 60 and dont wanna start from 1 lol
[1:30:04] Daemavand: classic lelveing is sooooo long
[1:31:12] GreenArrowed: getting sapped is the thing that tilts me the most
[1:31:25] Perkolate: and the rogue trinkets the infernal stun! We've never seen anything like this at GCDTV before!
[1:32:16] saga_no: I find myself very fascinated and kinda confused that the default strat for *anything* PvP isn't to just pile on the healers...
[1:34:13] cashthb: @saga_no healing is way to strong, most of the time can out heal the damage, you have to shut them down/take them away from the dps
[1:34:36] GreenArrowed: @saga_no Sometimes the healer can't out heal the damage and has better cheat deaths.
[1:34:51] saga_no: That's why it's fascinating
[1:35:19] GreenArrowed: i find killing disc priests very hard but i can stun lock them while dotting down a dps
[1:35:20] wolfcloudchaser80: Well, there was attempt #140 this year for the rocket/armor, still nada.
[1:36:08] SavageNoble: Who the heck is Polly!
[1:37:23] Sheepies: Hi Hazel! what is that WA group you are using underneath your target's target? looks really useful
[1:37:44] cashthb: how do the locks help with dampening?
[1:37:50] Eirchi: Polly Amorous
[1:38:06] J_Trinta: Solo shuffle you cant drink
[1:38:15] azumeraa: you can't drink in solo
[1:38:23] cashthb: you can eat cookies!
[1:38:32] jkuhl58: does a match end the moment someone dies?
[1:38:42] SavageNoble: @Eirchi Oh she sounds fun
[1:38:44] saga_no: Do lock cookies give mana, though?
[1:39:02] azumeraa: I think mage cookies don't despawn from your bag between rounds even if they are in enemy group? if they haven't fixed that
[1:39:17] cashthb: @saga_no mana buns
[1:39:33] saga_no: I've never heard mana buns referred to as cookies - only the lock ones
[1:40:45] SavageNoble: An under-leavened mana bun could be a cookie... I guess
[1:41:15] Sheepies: i meant the icons to the right of your target frame that glow when you can lifebloom, grove guardians, etc ^^ looks really useful to know when you reapply stuff
[1:42:03] Perkolate: that was soooo sick
[1:42:13] cashthb: mana buns are sweet rolls on the tooltip and a sweet roll is way close to a cookie than what ever a healthstone is
[1:42:31] Sheepies: ahh cool thank you! :D
[1:42:42] saga_no: Blues Clues
[1:43:56] azumeraa: will you guys play cata classic?
[1:44:26] jkuhl58: I think classic should have ended at wrath
[1:44:31] Lattick3: how does the % work for vicious saddles when doing shuffle?
[1:44:39] SavageNoble: Chaos Bolt! Chaos Bolt! Fear! 😃
[1:44:56] saga_no: I'm gonna check out Cata Classic to see what's up - even though I think the Classic era ended with Wrath
[1:44:59] jeffdmk: I am excited for WOD classic
[1:45:01] ahnn112: MoP classic will be my return
[1:45:14] jkuhl58: Shadowlands Classic
[1:45:45] Eirchi: The War Within Classic
[1:45:53] saga_no: My pedantic brain is like "....the map changed - no longer classic..."
[1:45:56] jeffdmk: 60 wod classic missions tables so much fun
[1:46:11] Zuldak: it is so weird they are doing cata because a big draw of classic was visiting pre cata azeroth. you can visit post cata azeroth in retail
[1:46:32] jkuhl58: yeah I don't know why they went to cata
[1:46:32] Veree: how many arenas you have to do in total for the mount?:D
[1:46:45] Colt_Engineer: tree power go
[1:47:15] Zuldak: @Veree Well 25% times 2% per round is 50 SS wins.
[1:47:22] Eirchi: Can the Tree be rooted?
[1:47:27] Zuldak: wait divide
[1:47:30] Feornzx: enemy lock portals
[1:48:07] Zuldak: so like 13 more SS wins?
[1:49:13] jeffdmk: why are you running out of mana?
[1:51:35] accio_coffee: !addons
[1:51:35] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:52:11] accio_coffee: i wonder if !kira works and kitty pops out :-)
[1:52:24] cashthb: maybe you should just get the passive trinket, I'm sure no one would bully you for it :)
[1:53:17] saga_no: I need food - brb
[1:53:33] jeffdmk: stream until you get there
[1:53:48] cashthb: you could also look for a 3s team
[1:54:24] SavageNoble: This is pretty much what I signed up for
[1:54:53] cashthb: yeah, the jade empire guy
[1:55:15] jkuhl58: the purple diamond should be on the DH and the orange circle should be on the druid.  this is bothering me
[1:56:10] cmefreeze: Lol
[1:56:17] cmefreeze: I'm like heal Hazel go lol
[1:56:34] cashthb: it was mage & dh, she did it to herself
[1:56:48] GreenArrowed: i don't think i've ever been in this map.
[1:57:09] SavageNoble: Fear! 😃
[1:59:02] jeffdmk: That is what it took for me to get to 8k in bgs this season i would get to 7900 and tank back to 7k over and over again
[1:59:43] cmefreeze: Yay lol
[2:01:26] jeffdmk: i see it a little different if you make the best possible choices in bgs you get the most insanely fun builds
[2:01:48] Feornzx: that's a mage wall?
[2:04:25] ghostie1995: trying to get mimirons jumpjets is so hard.. theres no one around to help and group finder takes a while
[2:06:21] ghostie1995: well if you get around to it hopefully im around too but no biggie
[2:06:28] saga_no: Ahh... when all else fails - plain buttered toast is the best meal
[2:06:46] AslanDaGr8: I love your Z and X macro to change target, im definitelly going to use it XD
[2:06:58] wolfcloudchaser80: @ghostie1995 Are you on NA servers? I can bring something to help.
[2:08:06] AslanDaGr8: Anyone know whats her MMR? I want to get the druid transmog but im really bad with druid... wondering how hard is to get it
[2:08:50] Daemavand: Crying is permitted!
[2:09:05] ghostie1995: @wolfcloudchaser80 yeah im on Moonguard NA
[2:09:10] wolfcloudchaser80: This isn't baseball, after all!
[2:09:20] Eirchi: Zed!  Check your Hazel Bingo cards
[2:09:27] wolfcloudchaser80: Tom Hanks said so.
[2:09:37] Daemavand: What if you cry out of happiness
[2:09:41] Daemavand: or if a bug flys into your eye
[2:09:43] rubibeya: It's from movie a league of their own
[2:09:45] SavageNoble: They make you play softball instead
[2:09:48] russtrotter: it's a line from the "league of their own" movie.. WW2 era-women's baseball
[2:09:48] Daemavand: like a big pizza pie
[2:09:49] saga_no: Or laughter if you're the Savannah Bananas
[2:10:08] KingfisherGames: Its a line from a famous movie. A League of their Own. A movie about the women's baseball league during ww2, but the only actor i can remember is tom hanks
[2:10:19] Draculesty: <3 love u hazel
[2:10:20] sence_00: stepped away to watch Echo v Dawgs, hows the prog?
[2:10:23] KingfisherGames: @saga_no ah the harlem globetrotters of baseball
[2:10:34] Eirchi: You can't remember Madonna, Gena Davis, John Lovitz?
[2:10:46] KaladinHS: what cr is she?
[2:10:49] GreenArrowed: rosie o'donnell
[2:10:50] jawea: Madonna geena davis
[2:11:01] saga_no: @KingfisherGames I honestly have no clue - they popped up on my FB feed randomly one day with a video
[2:11:01] wolfcloudchaser80: If you haven't seen A League of Their Own, put it on your list. Its great movie.
[2:11:25] wolfcloudchaser80: Though at one point they sing a song that is oddly proud about not being Canadian. Or Irish.
[2:12:13] jawea: as an Irishman we are proud
[2:12:22] ghostie1995: around the woorrld around the world
[2:12:33] sence_00: closing in!
[2:12:37] GreenArrowed: @wolfcloudchaser80 lol - the lyrics are "we've got canadians, irish ones and swedes" not "not"
[2:12:57] AslanDaGr8: Did you get all the arena transmog this season? The druid golden set looks amazing
[2:13:50] Daemavand: Its fun but they are labourous
[2:14:14] wolfcloudchaser80: @GreenArrowed All this time I've been thinking they were being oddly specifically nationalistic!
[2:14:16] Eirchi: Cabbage always feels like a punishment
[2:14:52] SavageNoble: I was hoping the gimmick was they could only use an Easy Bake Oven but this sounds good too
[2:15:06] Ujai321: how far have we counted so far?
[2:15:10] SavageNoble: Beautiful
[2:15:20] jakefx1: I need to watch this!
[2:15:22] SavageNoble: With one wee light bulb for heat
[2:15:24] wolfcloudchaser80: @Eirchi But cabbage combined with mashed potatoes and onions makes colcannon, and that's awesome.
[2:15:47] witchhobbit: i never got one but i liked the idea of it so much
[2:15:51] ghostie1995: yesss like the show Chopped, needs to get on with making the chefs make something with meals for the average single household or a big family whos busy all the time
[2:15:57] russtrotter: ez-bake oven, playdoh fun factory, .. i wanted  all that stuff
[2:16:02] Daemavand: Cabbage pancakes sound delicious
[2:16:12] witchhobbit: cabbage rolls are so good
[2:16:22] Eirchi: EZ Bake Ovens were actually powered by radioactivity, that's why they had to discontinue them
[2:16:35] jawea: and potentially scar you for life
[2:16:41] Daemavand: Cabbage rolls are love
[2:16:48] russtrotter: u should go take a sandwich break.. or just crush one on stream
[2:16:51] anne42: My mom just got me the easy bake food packets and had me use the real oven.
[2:16:52] Ujai321: nice, 77%
[2:16:54] saga_no: brb
[2:17:00] GreenArrowed: my play kitchen
[2:17:07] Ujai321: did that science kid have a name?
[2:17:08] wolfcloudchaser80: Lite-brite? Spirograph?
[2:17:09] Daemavand: Mircoscope for me :D or my sega genesis...
[2:17:14] GreenArrowed: oooh lightbrite
[2:17:16] witchhobbit: any of my dolls, barbie, polly pocket, bratz
[2:17:19] Daemavand: Yes Lite Brites!
[2:17:20] cashthb: pc counts? if no my bionicles, I had a lot
[2:17:28] Eirchi: The favorite toy that we never owned was MouseTrap... always lusted after MouseTrap
[2:17:29] Anissa89: i loved turtles as a k id
[2:17:30] Ujai321: i know, i was being silly
[2:17:42] russtrotter: litebrite was tough because the paper was a consumable that was hard to farm as a 5 year old
[2:17:44] SavageNoble: I feel like my sister(s) had a Lite Brite but I never officially had one
[2:17:52] SavageNoble: Mousetrap was awesome but I NEVER played it properly
[2:17:57] Daemavand: I just played Mouse Trap with my friends son over the xmas break lol
[2:18:00] Ujai321: tamagochi
[2:18:00] Daemavand: it holds up
[2:18:05] etherealbeluga: @Ujai321 bill nye the science guy
[2:18:10] heldtheline: I had a spirograph set, where you could draw all kinds of geometric things. It was oddly engaging
[2:18:14] wolfcloudchaser80: I remember a big Lego pirate ship I had as a kid. I loved that. I better have loved it, as an adult, I now realize how much my parents must have forked out for it.
[2:18:30] Eirchi: Lego was the best though.. endless hours
[2:18:59] Ujai321: lego really builds on itself
[2:19:03] SavageNoble: The curse of the elder sister is strong
[2:19:16] tildo03: Hazel there used to be a website about how pipettes were used improperly.  I think it is called "that's not what pipettes are for . com" or something like that
[2:19:23] witchhobbit: i liked the magnetic drawing boards and anything with coloring books and crayons
[2:19:45] Daemavand: Oh definitely, and I think you've gained some confidence as well :D
[2:19:45] jeffdmk: at least you did not have a younger sister that was better at everything that is far worse
[2:19:47] witchhobbit: what was that board you could only draw with twisty nobs
[2:19:51] witchhobbit: lol
[2:19:57] Eirchi: Plus she looks like Anne Hathaway!
[2:19:59] Daemavand: That's inspiring!
[2:20:07] heldtheline: etch-a-sketch, something like that
[2:20:17] witchhobbit: and you had to shake it to erase it
[2:20:30] witchhobbit: @heldtheline YES ty
[2:20:41] wolfcloudchaser80: For people of a certain age: playing with Simon.
[2:21:11] witchhobbit: now im remembering the bop it toy hahah
[2:21:50] heldtheline: I'm glad you finished that sentence, that pause was terrifying.
[2:21:55] GreenArrowed: i had a skipit
[2:22:17] Eirchi: shrimp? You mean they're not monkeys?
[2:23:11] cupcakechaos013: hey Hazel! how’s solo shuffle treating you today?
[2:24:02] Ujai321: we gained 9% so far, so pretty good
[2:24:08] Eirchi: We had all the deadly toys when I was a kid, Jarts, Slip'n'Slide, Chemistry Set
[2:24:32] jkuhl58: was so happy when I got my Uranium building blocks for christmas
[2:24:38] alycynde: Lawn darts
[2:24:47] jkuhl58: went well with the Enrichment toy i had
[2:24:56] alycynde: Very fun but rather deadly (if used wrong) game
[2:25:04] cupcakechaos013: it was really nice! had lunch with some friends and baby slept the whole time . much success lol
[2:25:24] jkuhl58: didn't someone literally die from lawn darts?
[2:25:28] cupcakechaos013: 9% seems really good since shuffle is slow for the mount
[2:25:29] Eirchi: Imagine a dart that's about 8 inches long, made of metal
[2:26:01] jgbrit: Hazel, are all the dragon skins available after dragonflight do you know, I really want to start working on them, especially the Razageth skin,
[2:26:25] Ujai321: tricicle jousting
[2:26:48] jgbrit: Great. I wasn't sure if they went away after the season
[2:27:27] saga_no: ....aaand back
[2:27:59] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ujai321 That sounds awesome.
[2:28:01] Eirchi: Statistically, I think that Slip'n'Slide was actually more dangerous than Jarts
[2:28:04] cupcakechaos013: also, I’m really enjoying the court of thrones and roses series. I understand people’s criticism of it but I’m not bored reading jt, the third one is very exciting
[2:28:22] Daemavand: Crazy karpets in the winter lol
[2:28:23] GreenArrowed: slip and slide was wild
[2:28:23] jkuhl58: baby's first landmine
[2:28:26] Daemavand: so fun, so danerous
[2:28:30] cupcakechaos013: it/*
[2:28:45] witchhobbit: @cupcakechaos013 yeah, like it is entertaining haha
[2:28:51] GreenArrowed: saucer sleds
[2:28:59] Daemavand: Nope but you went HELLA FAST lol
[2:28:59] GreenArrowed: sledding down hill into the street
[2:29:50] jkuhl58: little tike's artillery cannon, fun for the whole neighbor hood.
[2:30:07] cupcakechaos013: @haleych it’s made better since I’m reading it with friends and we discuss and share memes lol
[2:30:46] Eirchi: Oh, and SuperGlue, my parents definitely confiscated my SuperGlue
[2:30:57] wolfcloudchaser80: I made a blowpipe out of metal conduit/pipe and nails with masking tape as ammunition. Guess that wasn't super safe on reflection.
[2:31:01] Daemavand: That is smart
[2:31:32] Eirchi: Rural Canadian Upgringing!
[2:31:33] Ujai321: is that during your fabled rural canadian upbringing?
[2:32:26] Daemavand: It was interesting how the shift to wearing a helmet whilst skiing or snowboarding went from "barely anyone" to "everyone" within the span of a year or two, out here
[2:32:49] Daemavand: (This was probably 20 years ago or so, now)
[2:33:19] SavageNoble: Huzzah
[2:33:23] SavageNoble: 3 out of 4 ain't bad
[2:33:24] GreenArrowed: geeze
[2:34:08] SavageNoble: Sounds awesome
[2:34:11] jkuhl58: darwin award
[2:34:11] buckybarkes: buckybarkes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I finally got my saddle last night, youre almost there! hazelShiny
[2:34:12] Streamlabs: buckybarkes just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:34:17] GreenArrowed: i only ever see delivery people wearing helmets here
[2:34:23] Daemavand: I mean that is dumb but at the same time, this is something teenage me would have done
[2:34:41] GreenArrowed: i used to sled right into the street
[2:34:58] jeffdmk: hazel you might be slightly more risk adverse then average
[2:35:09] maloralyra: the hardest part of being a mom is keeping your kids alive. I swear kids and teenagers have no self preservation at all.
[2:35:09] SavageNoble: I probably wouldn't have ridden but I would have been the car spotter
[2:35:19] Daemavand: I was terrified of getting caught so learned how to plan my adventures meticously to not get caught lol
[2:35:47] MrSonicgen: Hello there.
[2:35:56] comemorning: as a long time mom i agree with that
[2:35:56] saga_no: My route to and from school was a 2.5km trek uphill (to school) - which meant.... a loooong slope to sled down going home. The slope ended in a road and then train tracks...
[2:36:16] saga_no: We did sled down that hill every day. Was steep too, so we sometimes struggled to stop before we reached the road at the bottom
[2:36:21] jkuhl58: it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye . . . then it's hilarious
[2:36:21] abadox09: abadox09 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:36:21] Streamlabs: abadox09 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:36:29] Ujai321: sheesh, for us it was "until somebody cries", but sure
[2:36:39] Eirchi: What druid form is that?
[2:36:47] abadox09: You're welcome and thanks for your youtube content.
[2:37:28] Ujai321: show us the chicken
[2:37:31] saga_no: This road was the main road going through the area, so it was always full of cars - even in winter - which was kinda worse because of the ice making it hard for both cars and sled to brake
[2:37:38] dapeanutbutter: Your hair looks fantastic Hazel!
[2:37:47] Eirchi: The flying butterfly one
[2:37:51] jeffdmk: is 5 of 8 a new appearance?
[2:37:52] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[2:37:52] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:38:01] Ujai321: what a chicken
[2:38:04] dapeanutbutter: Either way, it's great :D
[2:38:06] cashthb: chikens doesn't have horns, that's a cock!
[2:38:14] DestinamueGaming: i like to use the glyph of stars
[2:38:41] Eirchi: because they outlawed them
[2:38:57] DestinamueGaming: was never a fan of the moonkin form
[2:40:00] cashthb: he's literally like the worst character in the books
[2:40:23] heldtheline: I'm honestly surprised that warrior made it to max level with the name. hazelYikes
[2:40:37] jgbrit: It's done, I'm committed... I bought the 12 month sub *gulp*
[2:40:48] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no I probably would have ended up in the hospital if I grew up in the house I live in now. Our driveway is pretty steep, gets snow, and leads to a road that people notoriously speed on.
[2:40:54] comemorning: when i was a kid the sledding hill was called the ski hill, nnever found out if anyone ever skied on it. heela steep hard to climb but there was a road that went faround tro the top but no one ever drove their kids, dont remember any adults. ended up in a hockey arena parking lot, talk about dangerous.
[2:42:07] comemorning: sorry bout the typos
[2:44:05] GreenArrowed: woof is this still r1?
[2:44:19] GreenArrowed: nvm lolz
[2:45:03] comemorning: nothing like dodging hockey dads
[2:45:25] comemorning: oh dear
[2:47:11] Eirchi: Surprised at how well the Bread Machine has worked. Sometimes the loaf has a weird shape, but it always rises and tastes good
[2:48:05] cashthb: but why is it sour? did you forget the sugar?
[2:48:27] Eirchi: 5 times a week?!
[2:49:10] saga_no: afaik - sourdough doesn't use sugar, does it?
[2:49:27] cashthb: no wonder it's sour
[2:49:29] comemorning: @cashthb sour dough is a way of using a wild yeast
[2:49:43] comemorning: it uses sugar
[2:49:47] saga_no: Yeah - I know - I was just unsure since I've never made sourdough myself
[2:50:06] jeffdmk: is there anyone else in here that you dont take at face value?
[2:50:16] heldtheline: That rule goes for chat and capitalism, funnily enough.
[2:50:18] DestinamueGaming: @cashthb garrosh?
[2:50:18] 7thSaga: past 2 hours i only got 1 Solo Shuffle :( and i was 2/6
[2:50:43] comemorning: it can take time and you have to take care of your yeast specially
[2:52:36] Ujai321: oh, before i forget: did you check out the sheep game?
[2:54:01] jkuhl58: cyclone!
[2:54:04] Eirchi: This 'plant 3 seeds' quest must be the easiest weekly ever
[2:54:43] Ujai321: 1800 rating?
[2:54:57] cashthb: prolly account wide
[2:55:12] SavageNoble: There's one for 3 and one for 5
[2:55:16] SavageNoble: Please don't ask me which is which
[2:55:31] Ujai321: 81%, 1810 rating
[2:55:37] Ujai321: all things coming up millhouse
[2:55:42] cashthb: the one in the dream that rewards the token is 5, the one you get in valdrakken is 3
[2:55:43] SavageNoble: Good kitty
[2:55:53] jgbrit: I need literally 1 thing for The Love Fool Meta Achievement but I can't get into Arathi Basin NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:56:14] Ujai321: you are not gonna wake up in the morning, feeling like p diddy
[2:56:45] AYY0B: it’s a song lol
[2:56:45] Ujai321: like ke4ha, if you trust her lyrics
[2:56:52] Ujai321: *ke$ha
[2:57:00] cashthb: maybe you'll wake up with the notion; that you'd quiet like to sail to ocean
[2:57:07] Ujai321: but i assume you also dont know how she feels
[2:57:09] SavageNoble: I trust ke$ha implicitly
[2:57:16] comemorning: talking  of cats, i have to hide my seedlings cause they eat everything, even the tomatoes seedlings
[2:57:49] GreenArrowed: i'm about to start getting all of my planting started
[2:57:52] Ujai321: have a good rest of your day
[2:57:55] SavageNoble: Adios Hazel and chat!
[2:57:56] GreenArrowed: byyyye
[2:57:57] comemorning: ok later
