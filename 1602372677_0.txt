[8:18:05] xMika1: @AJ_0500 HEY jnbL
[8:18:15] CliffWoW: 750-800
[8:18:25] xMika1: @NoShotBuckoh yea so its basically reliving each expansion
[8:18:33] watsupyouguys: @jakenbakeLIVE what ur experience with MoP ?
[8:18:39] xMika1: but thereas also the classic server that will never get updated

[8:19:48] watsupyouguys: WoD content drought i get it but its the expansion where im the richest KEKW EZ
[8:19:48] GreenyScott: we hate shadowlands
[8:20:03] xMika1: @NoShotBuckoh Ppl like different expansions but the 2nd latest one was one of the worst liked

[8:20:08] StreamElements: https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpPoorNewtFeelsBadMan-DV2WtDMz4-p6Ky6x
[8:20:23] xMika1: I dont mind shadowlands that much
[8:20:51] NoShotBuckoh: ahh ok
[8:21:02] xMika1: but everyone has his own fav expansion and som didnt play the older ones
[8:21:10] xMika1: think wow is like 20 years old now?
[8:21:12] chief_sativa: you lost? just joined
[8:21:20] GreenyScott: revendreth was amazing, I totally wouldn't mind an entire expansion about revendreth
[8:21:23] watsupyouguys: 16 i think
[8:21:30] xMika1: ah

[8:21:52] NoShotBuckoh: this is why i was confised why people were bashing Bl;izzard so hard yet they come back and play the same game
[8:22:00] watsupyouguys: warcraft is at least 20 yos
[8:22:04] CallMeInfinity: @NoShotBuckoh, One can not simply quit WoW, only breaks
[8:22:09] xMika1: I played it a bit when younger but didnt understand and only had 1 month playtime
[8:22:24] xMika1: @watsupyouguys that makes sense yea
[8:22:34] watsupyouguys: many OMEGAWOW ppl convert into ff14 fanboys KEKW
[8:22:45] xMika1: still havent touched ff
[8:22:47] GreenyScott: real question is, where does classic go beyond wrath, does blizzard dare to progress into cata? LUL
[8:22:50] xMika1: too weeby even for me
[8:23:10] watsupyouguys: @GreenyScott they r taking next step carefully and doing surveys lol
[8:23:16] xMika1: @GreenyScott they remaster it COPIUM
[8:24:20] watsupyouguys: rather than next classic i just hope dragonflight lore isnt shit KEKW
[8:24:44] GreenyScott: im expecting the worst and hoping for the best after the jailer lmao
[8:25:18] NoShotBuckoh: only thing i dont like about WoW is that you need people to Raid Boss for the BIS gear.. i wanna be aple to solo bosses
[8:25:30] GreenyScott: don't think im gonna touch retail again though
[8:25:30] xMika1: @NoShotBuckoh you can with older raids
[8:26:02] NoShotBuckoh: yea but they arent BIS gear right
[8:26:25] xMika1: yea thats true
[8:26:29] Slajso: I mean...it *is* a MMO
[8:26:32] watsupyouguys: cant get bis gear in a mmo thru solo, even arena is 2v2
[8:26:38] Slajso: priorities, and all that
[8:26:42] xMika1: but I mean you dont really have to min max that much
[8:26:49] GreenyScott: i forget, was it wod where you could get mythic raid gear without having to raid?
[8:26:55] watsupyouguys: even mobile gacha games force to raid or do with guild for most of them
[8:27:11] xMika1: I personally like that you ave to interact with other ppl to achieve something better
[8:27:24] Xinleen: i thought u were a irl streamer?
[8:27:34] xMika1: @Zeke_o7 LUL
[8:27:38] GreenyScott: !japan
[8:27:39] StreamElements: When is Jake going back to Japan ? https://clips.twitch.tv/ColorfulEnjoyableJamWoofer-QPKUCC-d2M-N2tkF
[8:27:40] watsupyouguys: vanilla wow u can sort of solo to high warlord or grand marshal for best pvp gear,
[8:28:05] Slajso: I'm happy to have played this game back in vanilla and 00's in general. It was different, everything was unknown, I knew nothing about loot or anything, and I could just run and have fun LUL
[8:28:05] Xinleen: i just found jake's yt
[8:28:17] Xinleen: and then came here from there
[8:28:22] xMika1: looking good > good gear
[8:28:47] xMika1: @Zeke_o7 hes going back to Japan soon. hes done some EU IRL lately
[8:29:24] Slajso: We used to play for 20 months before hitting 60 in Vanilla..and we had fun, every single moment.
[8:29:27] NoShotBuckoh: so we can all agree WoW has low skill requirement when it comes to Bossing cause you can just leech in Group Raids
[8:29:30] Slajso: *2 LUL
[8:29:44] xMika1: @NoShotBuckoh depends per boss but most are done pretty easily
[8:30:21] xMika1: thats also why you join a guild so everyone does equal effort
[8:30:33] xMika1: with looking for group theres always gonna be afk farmers
[8:30:39] NoShotBuckoh: ahh see its either Runescape or WoW
[8:31:07] xMika1: Always found RS bosses too easy
[8:31:24] xMika1: and the game is mainly a solo experience
[8:31:30] NoShotBuckoh: yes thats why i like it
[8:31:33] xMika1: OSRS that is idk aaobut the new onme
[8:31:48] xMika1: Personally I like socializing doing MMOs
[8:32:00] NoShotBuckoh: i like to Solo grind and not depend on others for my gear
[8:32:16] GreenyScott: like having a convo with other people cooking to 99
[8:32:18] GreenyScott: those were some times
[8:32:29] xMika1: @NoShotBuckoh understandable
[8:32:32] NoShotBuckoh: yea thats skilling though
[8:32:41] Danny_Neptune: any cable ressers
[8:32:49] xMika1: @GreenyScott Selling gf 10k gold
[8:33:03] xMika1: but yea stuff like thaqt LUL
[8:33:55] xMika1: Think MMOs were better when we didnt know much about it
[8:34:04] xMika1: knowing everythign about it kinda ruins the magic
[8:34:13] GreenyScott: games in general
[8:34:17] xMika1: true
[8:34:25] GreenyScott: back in the day when mew was under the truck
[8:35:28] nizzlerr: WOTLK HYPE POGGERS
[8:35:41] xMika1: LUL
[8:37:08] NoShotBuckoh: so who gets the gear when it drops?
[8:38:48] xMika1: @NoShotBuckoh deepends. it goes to who uses the  right class for the gear
[8:39:58] NoShotBuckoh: i saw asmon doesnt some dice roll thing  LULE
