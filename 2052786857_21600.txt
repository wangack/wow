[8:10:38] relmo: this gang would be nowhere without his money
[8:10:46] Nightbot: Please check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/GraycenTV
[8:10:51] Usahi_Light: Hmmm who was it that accused archie of trying to "buy his way in" Clueless
[8:10:53] Thomsan04: The gang needs money to operate though so that's pretty good to bring in....
[8:11:06] Marks0nn: he needs to make up his mind really
[8:11:22] HappysFunPalace: this house ICANT
[8:11:39] theJOATx: yeah this house is a OCD nightmare
[8:11:44] Gozs: House raid inc
[8:11:44] relmo: still no beds in a house for 50 people. gonna have to -10 this one dawg
[8:11:46] Lizzurdx: it is i hate it

[8:12:24] BerkTheLUL: SEXO
[8:12:41] bluewayland: Careful he is stream sniping
[8:13:16] HappysFunPalace: the spiral staircase not connecting to the middle floor really brings the house together
[8:13:33] Thomsan04: There's no problem having him keep track of the cash flow in a ledger. It's smart. He just doesn't get a say where the money should go. And unless someone steps up as an actual leader, everything should be voted on beforehand.
[8:13:41] Fakomi: ahmadmuhsin
[8:13:55] BerkTheLUL: @Fakomi peepoBaba

[8:15:04] HappysFunPalace: afaik they cant, they would need to scope you out and see where you go and get warrants
[8:15:12] relmo: next time just don't throw it after you're down again
[8:15:31] Usahi_Light: its why people put shit in their parents name or other family members
[8:15:41] EmilTuT: no contract tho right? so u dont even own part of the house
[8:15:44] AlexSamaAU: they can investigate your known associates and properties you visit regularly and ask for a warrant to raid the clean guys house
[8:15:59] oneALMONDMILKplease: catJAM
[8:16:07] Trae618: Nice door dumbass
[8:16:10] Usahi_Light: like so far im pretty sure 100% of the raids since 4.0 are because of  stolen/planted PD guns, getting caught with weed is just gonna get you jail time
[8:16:31] AlexSamaAU: theres been weed raids
[8:16:47] AlexSamaAU: mostly only appartment
[8:16:55] iWALL_E: is this apex legends
