[0:07:25] anker_jym: I also didn't have realize it's Leap Day today!
[0:07:38] Ujai321: Morgrgegllglfging
[0:07:39] Daemavand: You could still do that and program it for when you're feeling well
[0:07:47] Daemavand: Oof
[0:08:40] itsparvati: not every illness is covid plague!
[0:09:01] averageteacup: First thing i hear that you don't have COVID ... good news :D
[0:09:09] cheesy_tater: YAAAY trading post
[0:09:16] cheesy_tater: do you know what's coming yet?
[0:09:17] Daemavand: Oh dear, too much game
[0:09:24] Daemavand: All at once lol
[0:09:35] fallingupwards: Well you do have the entire month of March to do the trading post 😉
[0:09:36] GreenArrowed: i've been fighting something that's "not covid" too but it sure does feel like covid
[0:09:45] cheesy_tater: oh shweet
[0:09:45] wolfcloudchaser80: But wait, one of the benefits of being a hermit is not getting sick!
[0:10:19] GreenArrowed: yea, i don't leave my apt at all. it's because there are a ton of gross kids in my building.
[0:10:23] Octopixy1971: Hello Miss Kira <3 <3 <3
[0:10:27] anker_jym: I got worried when I saw Inksy was a human, thought you had sworn off Gnomes. Then I realized you're an Argent Tournament NPC lol
[0:10:29] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[0:10:47] BoogiePonderosa: oh no sick?
[0:10:52] averageteacup: honestly i miss when everyone was wearing masks

[0:11:39] nyrhalahotep: Hug kitty, please. 🥰🥰🥰
[0:11:42] Daemavand: Yes those were chill streams
[0:11:46] aerissune: I wear them on planes, especially in the winter
[0:11:48] Daemavand: Look at you, playing things
[0:11:55] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm currently absorbed by Nightingale.
[0:12:06] saga_no: Juuhuu
[0:12:15] saga_no: Yay!
[0:12:16] Daemavand: That is the correct thing to do when there are too many games lol
[0:12:19] Daemavand: Oh DAMN
[0:12:27] Daemavand: Let us know how you find!
[0:12:35] kynlaeh: i start my clinical rotations in the hospital this fall and i fully plan on wearing a mask bc after i thought about it idk why providers didn’t before being in sick people’s mouths
[0:12:37] itsparvati: hi kira kisses
[0:12:49] saga_no: Good news is that BG3 is a lot easier than 5e DnD for someone who's never played it before :)
[0:13:23] saga_no: Yeh - most of the BG lore is from the characters
[0:13:39] saga_no: At least the part of the lore you interact with actively
[0:13:53] McScooterson: If that buddy is Astarion...
[0:14:00] aerissune: Are you going to do a romance?
[0:14:09] Daemavand: That's a good start!
[0:14:15] saga_no: What Race/Class are you playing?
[0:14:20] Daemavand: Give it time lol
[0:14:24] Zuldak: Not your type? O.o
[0:14:39] saga_no: Ahh - nice <3
[0:14:52] Ekemon88: LUL
[0:14:55] Ujai321: Ah, venturing outside the comfort zone, I see
[0:14:58] BoogiePonderosa: I sort of feel that way about wow… the storylines are so epic now but we started helping people fix a broken cart and get their food ingredients
[0:14:59] Daemavand: Sea of Stars has been my jam on Switch, cozy turn-based pixel RPG, was great for a long flight :D
[0:15:11] saga_no: I did something ...new and scary in WoW today.
[0:15:20] Daemavand: Dude character creation is the best part lol
[0:15:56] BoogiePonderosa: and anatomy 🫣
[0:16:08] Daemavand: Oooh did you tank, saga?
[0:16:18] Cyberwolffe: I can't start another game right now.  We are starting our busy season at work and I'll be lucky to keep up with WoW and Overwatch while working 7 days a week.
[0:16:23] BoogiePonderosa: hahah
[0:16:37] Ujai321: The thing I learned, and that gives me great peace of mind: there are no wrong choices in bg3
[0:16:43] Zuldak: So your character was accidentally fully nude?
[0:16:56] saga_no: I've spent most of last week getting the PvP toon to 70... and today, after having geared her a little, I decided to re-spec to Disco.... queued for Arena Skirmish (cuz of the weekly quest) - did ONE match... and WE WON!?
[0:16:57] itsparvati: the number of times i have reloaded previous saves from selling the wrong things is just embarrassing
[0:17:19] GreenArrowed: there are choices that will prematurely end the game very early
[0:17:29] Ujai321: Yeah, there is a ton of choice, but all of them are cool, no matter what basically
[0:17:41] GreenArrowed: @saga_no gg!
[0:17:43] itsparvati: starfield was the worst, i would sell good weapons on mistake all the time
[0:17:48] saga_no: I was terrified the entire time
[0:17:50] GreenArrowed: talk to ALL OF THE ANIMALS
[0:17:58] GreenArrowed: they gave everyone single one diaglogue
[0:18:01] saga_no: But the other 2 people on my team just obliterated the opponent
[0:18:22] Daemavand: Dude the amount of work put into that game is impressive af
[0:18:32] saga_no: Might even finish off LFR for the Fyrakk-quest as Disco just to cement my clownery
[0:18:34] Just_Aizla: Yesterday I completed all the legion drop mounts :D
[0:18:42] GreenArrowed: i've been shuffling this week, but i got DC'd 3 times yesterday and tanked my rating. so frustrating.
[0:18:57] BoogiePonderosa: “flurmy”?
[0:19:06] GreenArrowed: but i'm 81% to the mount so i'll take that.
[0:19:12] saga_no: I'm still gearing so the Skirmish was unrated; I need to get my ilvl up enough to queue for Shuffle
[0:19:28] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[0:19:39] saga_no: But like - .... now I'm thinking I could feasibly do it as Disco (and have Shadow as a fall-back when I get too discouraged)
[0:19:46] Daemavand: Lol
[0:19:51] itsparvati: inventing words is fun!
[0:19:58] BoogiePonderosa: it works! haha
[0:19:58] GreenArrowed: @saga_no if you're up for it, popping into epic BGs will get you honor and very fast to buy your greens
[0:20:26] Ujai321: I didn't know you spoke French
[0:20:33] itsparvati: now are these everyone words or hazel words?
[0:20:37] saga_no: @GreenArrowed I've done a few regular BGs and a couple of Blitz ones (found some quests and stuff) and I'm slowly acquiring PvP greens :)
[0:20:46] GreenArrowed: hon hon hon
[0:20:51] Zuldak: Booboo bear makes me think of yogi bear
[0:20:52] Daemavand: Can confirm that is correct French!
[0:20:55] Daemavand: :D
[0:21:08] GreenArrowed: @saga_no yea picking up the quests are a huge boost
[0:21:18] Daemavand: As someone currently in Holland it sounds to me like people are constantly inventing words around me
[0:21:27] Daemavand: Or maybe they're just speaking Dutch
[0:21:27] Ujai321: Didn't mean to slurp, but did mean to flurp
[0:21:29] saga_no: @GreenArrowed I still refuse to turn WarMode on, though LUL
[0:21:32] GreenArrowed: oh, i go through my duolingo phases, but that bird is SO MEAN
[0:21:33] Zuldak: Reject French embrace Korean again
[0:21:42] GreenArrowed: @saga_no oh same
[0:22:05] BoogiePonderosa: “8-16” haha
[0:22:07] Daemavand: I fully approve of the French Duolingo phase lol
[0:22:33] GreenArrowed: i've been learning little bits of korean from my friends mom so we can tease him together
[0:22:35] saga_no: Don't feel bad, Hazel... I had French for 6 years in school and can't speak it at all
[0:22:37] anker_jym: Yo, I'm also learning French on Duolingo!
[0:22:41] Ujai321: Oh sorry, my bad
[0:22:43] DoctorOgenki: i was here!
[0:22:45] heldtheline: I know nothing but is Quebec French regular French or is it fancy French?
[0:22:48] saga_no: I can read it and pronounce it just fine - I just can't converse
[0:22:50] Zuldak: Isn't flurm the thing. From fruturama?
[0:22:51] Hulkhokie: it feels like we've spent so much time with you farming this, when it drops we should all get it too
[0:22:57] BoogiePonderosa: need a Hazelexicon

[0:23:04] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh, hey, the new Trader's Tender stuff is announced, huh?
[0:23:08] KurdBoom: Notre français n'est pas si bon haha!
[0:23:16] Daemavand: It's the same language but the accent is massively different
[0:23:20] saga_no: The French people I worked with would swap to English when speaking to people from Quebec LUL
[0:23:21] GreenArrowed: that is a very good comparison
[0:23:26] kynlaeh: i can understand quebecois however sometimes sounds a bit archaic to me
[0:23:27] Daemavand: And there's differences in expressions, slang, etc
[0:23:29] AtRHydralisk: @KurdBoom Il n'est pas si pire... c'est surtout l'accent!
[0:23:32] kynlaeh: in some phrases

[0:23:32] Streamlabs: lilley13 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:23:33] saga_no: They gave up on the French... could not understand each other at all
[0:23:57] BoogiePonderosa: it’s still not march is it
[0:24:01] Daemavand: Oh and the swear words are all completely different too!
[0:24:02] KurdBoom: Our french Vs French french is mainly different verbally with the accent, but the word are suppose to be the same hahaha!
[0:24:07] Hulkhokie: oooh battle pet is the reward this month, i'm definitely finishing
[0:24:10] Ujai321: Like Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[0:24:23] kynlaeh: yeah swear words confuse me lol
[0:24:31] trivotix: When they really start mucking about. One of my favorite phrases from Aussies

[0:24:42] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh man, the mouse is adorable.
[0:24:46] saga_no: Ironically; I rarely struggle with the various English accents - but that's probably because I've been taught English formally, and not through toddler osmosis
[0:24:47] GreenArrowed: i can barely understand quebecois, that's how i feel about oz and some scots english
[0:25:05] saga_no: The person would have to have an extremely thick accent before I start to struggle
[0:25:16] BoogiePonderosa: knew an Australian girl in high school that no one. could understand at first
[0:25:19] saga_no: Glaswegian?
[0:25:28] saga_no: (Glasgow accent)
[0:25:30] Zuldak: Any rural British accent

[0:25:37] Streamlabs: beckstaaaa just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:25:46] GreenArrowed: i sometimes have a really hard time with super northeastern US accents like maine
[0:25:46] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Heh, I'm glad I didn't pick up my mom's strong Texan accent!
[0:25:50] kaitteemoon: why don’t you dragon ride there?
[0:26:08] saga_no: Y'all should be pleased I didn't pick up the local accent in Pittsburgh LUL
[0:26:13] kynlaeh: i also need subtitles it magically makes me hear better lol
[0:26:30] saga_no: It's... *different* - let's just say that
[0:26:33] GreenArrowed: you mean you don't call everyone jawn?
[0:26:39] saga_no: Yinz
[0:26:48] saga_no: "Pittsburghese" is ...special
[0:27:10] BoogiePonderosa: haha Yinzers
[0:27:12] fallingupwards: I think the way they mix sound for new shows and movies is weird. The dialogue is super quiet but the sound effects are extremely loud
[0:27:48] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I'm fairly certain I'd be able to understand it within a reasonable time ;P
[0:27:55] wolfcloudchaser80: My partner is a literal Valley Girl. I'm very thankful she didn't pick up that particular accent. Like, totally.
[0:28:40] eielwind: wont he get it for sure next week now?
[0:28:49] Ujai321: Only needs 2 more kills, brutal
[0:29:00] anker_jym: Good for your partner looking out for your raid night schedule lol
[0:29:18] Daemavand: Pour one out for the weapon-less warrior homie
[0:29:24] trivotix: Is next season 2 weeks away?
[0:29:24] lilley13: My guild is doing achievements this week then I think were done
[0:29:40] trivotix: oh okay phew!
[0:30:05] saga_no: My guild is still chipping away at Mythic and doing Heroic farms - but I haven't felt like raiding lately
[0:30:14] saga_no: (I'm obviously not on the Mythic roster, lmao)
[0:30:20] jgbrit: Hi Hazel, got a few mins before I start. How was your weekend?
[0:30:31] eielwind: on mythic tindral now, taht fight slaps so hard
[0:30:40] eielwind: as the kids say
[0:30:50] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Actually, it probably wouldn't be that hard. Us southerners tend to speak slower than most, and that makes it easier for ESL learners.
[0:31:05] saga_no: It's partially because I decided to make PvP my 2024 goal - so I don't have to show up to raid nights and stuff; I can work on my goal on my own time
[0:31:10] Ujai321: We are all just cogs in the machine, man
[0:31:20] necrowoof: at least until they all have their legendary
[0:31:45] Bronloch: Hazel are you playing HCSF at all?
[0:31:47] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 And - ...the "general southern" accent is also widely used in TV so we're already familiar with it
[0:31:52] jgbrit: Aww I'm sorry to hear that. Speedy recovery
[0:32:16] Ujai321: Secret second stream today?
[0:32:20] jgbrit: Oh is self found out now?
[0:32:26] eielwind: oh shoot thats today!
[0:32:30] Zuldak: Manager Kira votes for bed
[0:32:32] eielwind: what time is it out?
[0:32:44] Bronloch: 3PM PST
[0:32:46] Ujai321: And the sub goal would be a million?
[0:33:16] saga_no: I mean... this is also your job / income - so having an *idea* of subs and such comes with the territory, no?
[0:33:18] eielwind: im all for being unethical :D
[0:33:34] Ujai321: You kept ME awake, and I'm on the other side of the world!
[0:33:44] Bronloch: it just adds a "clench factor" to the game that we normally never feel LUL
[0:34:06] wolfcloudchaser80: Wait, is that your murloc onesie?
[0:34:29] jgbrit: I've been levelling my BM in Shadowlands. Stupidly forgot to cap my xp and got yeeted last night. Stupid chromie
[0:34:51] cashthb: hey mom, how ya' doin'?
[0:35:04] Daemavand: Lol
[0:35:11] cashthb: fine I guess
[0:35:19] jgbrit: Shadowlands is legit my fave xpac, don't @ me
[0:35:31] Ujai321: Oh, back to bg3 for a second: are you keeping that for your own time? Or are you gonna stream some of it?
[0:35:37] Daemavand: Which film?
[0:35:55] Bronloch: Legion or TBC is my fav
[0:36:03] daws001: Juno is such a classic. watched that a bunch of times
[0:36:11] anker_jym: The real question is, who will you be romancing in BG3?
[0:36:14] Ujai321: For the record, I wouldn't recommend it, just curious
[0:36:43] anker_jym: Oh oops, I was off the stream for a few minutes, sorry if you've already answered
[0:36:47] Bronloch: you seem like a secret Laezel? LUL
[0:36:54] anne42: anne42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 13 month streak! I really enjoy my time with you because you are so sweet and relatable
[0:36:55] Streamlabs: anne42 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:37:05] DapherCake: Who have you met and what would ypu say your type is? Lol
[0:37:08] saga_no: Oh I *hated* Shadowheart for like 99% of my playthrough.... LUL
[0:37:17] cashthb: of
[0:37:19] Bronloch: LUL
[0:37:24] Curufin_: mithara is an edgelord lover ^^
[0:37:35] cashthb: Gale is very humble for a wizzard tho!
[0:37:37] GreenArrowed: loool not snacking
[0:37:38] daws001: i romanced Gale. it was magical
[0:38:02] saga_no: Letting VampBoi snack on you is beneficial for future gameplay ;P
[0:38:14] vampire_enthusiast: A good friend of mine looks exactly like Shadowheart irl, same bangs and everything, so that's her new nickname
[0:38:14] NordicSorcerer: Happy anniversary, @saga_no ! <3
[0:38:18] saga_no: hehehe
[0:38:18] Bronloch: you seem like a Karlach fan?
[0:38:23] saga_no: THank you @NordicSorcerer
[0:38:39] Cipfried9: hi
[0:38:51] ghostie1995: I love Wyll ❤️
[0:39:01] Ujai321: Just remember the first rule of improv: say 'yes, and...'
[0:39:08] GreenArrowed: halsin might do it
[0:39:41] ghostie1995: also Halsin stan!
[0:39:51] NordicSorcerer: Goblin camp bbq (I play sorcerer)...
[0:39:55] heldtheline: @GreenArrowed I was just thinking that he kinda reminds me of Barnaclus
[0:40:04] saga_no: I refused any and all advances / romances in BG3
[0:40:15] saga_no: So my whole camp is whiny about it LUL
[0:40:38] balmofgilead: hi hazel! just wanted to say thanks for the guides especially for heroic raid. been incredibly helpful for my guild and myself :D
[0:40:47] Daemavand: Is chat energizing you
[0:40:51] Daemavand: To jump into ssf
[0:40:56] cashthb: honestly... astarion is the only one with any personality, laezel has some early on but she'll forget about it
[0:41:05] lilley13: are you going to play warlock in self found?
[0:41:05] Daemavand: HUZZAH KEEP IT UP CHAT
[0:41:07] azumeraa: @balmofgilead best raid guides out there!
[0:41:09] ghostie1995: shadowheart being a racist towards lae zel at the start just made the interaction start on the wrong foot. I eventually got shadowheart to be friends with her
[0:41:14] wolfcloudchaser80: I've been looking into BG3 and DnD in general and now I'm just bummed that there's no Tinkerer class in BG3. Sounds like it would be fun gameplay.
[0:41:19] Daemavand: We're better than any medicine!
[0:41:21] saga_no: Yep. It's kinda hilarious. Cuz now they're like... not knowing how to approach me when I just shoot them down as soon as they suggest something akin to romance
[0:41:29] Ujai321: All I know about the party in bg3: nobody likes Gale
[0:41:39] Bronloch: Warlock secret loser in HC tho if you watched WillIE's old video LUL
[0:41:43] fireburnxdhdpt: it drops now gz
[0:42:11] TypicalChels: TypicalChels subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! Happy Thursday Hazel & Chat <3
[0:42:11] Streamlabs: typicalchels just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:42:12] GreenArrowed: depending on how you play, everyone in the party can love and support everyone
[0:42:12] eielwind: I want to try SSF but no idea what to try, didn’t really play HC
[0:42:17] Ujai321: Is snatched still a thing, ma'am?
[0:42:18] NordicSorcerer: @ghostie1995 that door swings both ways (Laezhel hates everyone and everything though)
[0:42:26] GreenArrowed: lae'zel becomes such a gale supporter
[0:42:27] kaitteemoon: i feel a bit silly that I didn’t know that you could skip to the final boss here 😢
[0:42:39] GreenArrowed: depending on your choices
[0:42:43] BoogiePonderosa: bg3 has looksmaxxing?
[0:42:50] saga_no: Lae'zel has the steepest character arc imo
[0:43:16] azumeraa: @kaitteemoon you can also skip in underrot
[0:43:16] GreenArrowed: @saga_no i've had 3 different endings for her and they were both soo good and such turn arounds for her
[0:43:16] cashthb: on the other hand I thought that everybody's kinda ugly, even characters that were insanly hot before became... well old... 200 year gap from bg2
[0:43:31] IAmScarlett__: hiii
[0:43:36] saga_no: Beholders are cute, though
[0:43:38] Bronloch: BG3 keep it secret keep it safe! LUL
[0:43:38] saga_no: ;D
[0:43:47] Ujai321: Are there beholders in BG?
[0:43:50] GreenArrowed: lipsmackers looooools
[0:43:51] saga_no: Yep.
[0:43:56] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[0:44:07] IAmScarlett__: i have arrived to say its my bday monday
[0:44:10] BoogiePonderosa: Lipsmaxxing
[0:44:13] GreenArrowed: popularity was based on how many lipsmackers you had on your lipstancker necklace when i was a kid
[0:44:16] GreenArrowed: @Ujai321 yes
[0:44:21] wolfcloudchaser80: I watch a guy that sometimes streams BG3, and his major channel schtick is that he almost never reads chat. You could stream BG3 that way.
[0:44:29] NordicSorcerer: I think this chat also proved what a brilliant job Larian has done (and is still doing) with BG3: everybody can play it "their way", and still have fun, even if that makes it a zillion different stories (also makes for replay value)
[0:44:29] GreenArrowed: i've done the spider cave once and i'll never go back
[0:44:38] Ujai321: Do you know that beholders are a thing in DND? I learned that very late in life
[0:44:41] Bronloch: BG3 has a ton of monsters from the books
[0:44:43] IAmScarlett__: are you romancing astarion
[0:44:53] NordicSorcerer: @ujai321 you want to explore the underdark more...
[0:45:18] saga_no: One of my favorite BG3 related things is High Rollers on YouTube having the voice actors from BG3 and they do a DnD oneshot - and the actors play as their characters from the game. It's fantastic.
[0:45:35] wolfcloudchaser80: The funny bit could be that you continuously acknowledge and talk to chat, but aggressively don't read it.
[0:45:36] NordicSorcerer: @greenarrowed you need something from down there for a quest item.
[0:45:40] averageteacup: i just ate frish fig for the first time in my life ... yuck! i prefer them dried :D
[0:45:50] GreenArrowed: i'd say most of the fantasy stuff we play that's modern pulled from dnd
[0:45:51] cashthb: d&d is in general a very vanilla flavour of fantasy
[0:45:54] Ujai321: If you want, I suggest googling "beholder". I think about it every time now someone says "beauty is in the eye of the beholder"
[0:46:00] Bronloch: Order of "theft" = Norse edda Poems > Tolkien > D&D > Warhammer > Everquest > WOW LUL
[0:46:10] saga_no: I found a lot of DnD-esque stuff in WoW Classic when I was leveling in that
[0:46:26] GreenArrowed: @NordicSorcerer only if you're doing/care about the quest
[0:46:29] Daemavand: You were hyper focused anyway
[0:46:32] kynlaeh: i was so excited about the owl bear form in wow cuz of the D&D movie
[0:46:35] Daemavand: Ok beating the thing
[0:46:45] GreenArrowed: @NordicSorcerer there's very little you NEED to do in bg3
[0:46:47] saga_no: I was about to suggest "derivative" - but yes... LUL
[0:46:57] Bronloch: all this elves and orcs and trolls and dwarfs is from the Norse Edda Poems LUL
[0:47:23] NordicSorcerer: @bronloch that order (into d&d) has been verified by Weis and Hickman who wrote most of the TSR lore for d&d, btw.
[0:47:29] wolfcloudchaser80: Like: "Hm, I bet going through that door may lead to an ambush... but I'm going to do it anyway!" As chat screams and screams that it's an ambush!
[0:48:02] dracoress1: dracoress1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:48:02] Streamlabs: dracoress1 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:48:03] saga_no: And that is how you play DnD
[0:48:08] saga_no: You... think it - you try it - see what happens
[0:48:13] Daemavand: But fire is warm
[0:48:17] Daemavand: And my feet are cold
[0:48:22] Bronloch: @NordicSorcerer Weis and Hickman are goated for Dragonlance Trilogy Kreygasm
[0:48:27] ronnyjai_the_scrubjay: 
[0:48:31] GreenArrowed: yea, i just don't think streaming bg3 will be fun. i've avoided it bc i've just watched people scream in chat bc you're not doing what they did or how you think they should do it.
[0:48:44] Ujai321: "I attack ... THE DARKNESS!"
[0:49:07] NordicSorcerer: @daemavand cast wall of fire at your feet. You'll remain warm for the rest of your life. :p
[0:49:17] saga_no: Not even 2 weeks if you just crank through the campaigns available to you
[0:49:20] ronnyjai_the_scrubjay: Thank you kindly for the really fast reply :D !!!
[0:49:28] saga_no: and then jump into raid or keys to push the ilvl further
[0:49:29] Daemavand: It is
[0:49:40] Daemavand: Big bias to ally
[0:49:50] Ujai321: Duh, famous streamer hazelnuttygames is on alliance
[0:50:02] Daemavand: This is true.
[0:50:20] miiver73: How many lvl 70 characters do you have?
[0:50:28] Daemavand: "I was pet collecting before it was cool"
[0:50:29] BoogiePonderosa: realm influencer
[0:50:38] Daemavand: Hazel pet hipster confirmed
[0:50:58] NordicSorcerer: @bronloch they were a part of the original d&d, ad&d, ad&d2e team (I used to be a playbymail dm when Spelljammer was introduced)
[0:50:59] Bronloch: composting in your pocket would keep you warm
[0:51:07] saga_no: Which is a logical hypothesis
[0:51:14] TinySp00k: But more importantly, what did you tell the plant?
[0:51:25] wolfcloudchaser80: I leveled an alt on Lightbringer with the vague idea of joining the Squirrel Squad, but kinda got distracted by other games around the time I hit 70.
[0:51:32] morder1765: whats ur World Quest addon ?
[0:51:37] DarkEnforcer: DarkEnforcer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 43 and counting
[0:51:37] Streamlabs: darkenforcer just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:51:40] Bronloch: that is the theory of why talking to plants statistically produces more flower yield LUL
[0:51:41] zlinda95: Heii!
[0:51:51] Ujai321: You could try being nice to one and mean to another
[0:52:00] Daikanatv: are those all different classes or repeats? my problem is i have tons of repeats LUL
[0:52:06] NordicSorcerer: @bronloch btw, if you like Weis and Hickman, you should read the death gate cycle books. Not D&D, but brilliant :)
[0:52:06] ghostie1995: that seems way more logical lol I was over here thinking plants had feelings and they feel happy being talked to 😬
[0:52:09] Ujai321: "you are the best flower. But you, other flower, you suck!"
[0:52:12] saga_no: So - those of y'all who do LFR more than I do - how much ish will I get if I rock up as Disco not knowing the first thing about raid healing?
[0:52:25] BoogiePonderosa: archeology!
[0:52:44] BoogiePonderosa: bag organizing
[0:52:53] Bronloch: @NordicSorcerer NICE i didnt realize they were so core to the lore! Couldnt have picked much better
[0:53:05] Bronloch: @NordicSorcerer thx i will check it out
[0:53:35] anker_jym: You could reorder you character selection screen in alphabetical order
[0:53:37] wolfcloudchaser80: @ronnyjai_the_scrubjay Oh, and by the way, for gearing now, the most bang for your buck is doing the Superbloom in Emerald Dream and the associated weekly quests. Don't skip those!
[0:54:20] saga_no: Main > PvP > Alts I'm working on currently > My private guild toons
[0:54:24] Bronloch: OOHH sorting by ilvl would be PIMP!!! Make it happen Blizz! LUL
[0:54:24] saga_no: that's how I order mine
[0:54:44] saga_no: They've reworked Disco to the point where there's like HALF the buttons involved now
[0:55:07] ronnyjai_the_scrubjay: @wolfcloudchaser80 thank you for the extra advice !!
[0:55:16] NordicSorcerer: @bronloch any time. As you probably can imagine, I was one of those "problem child"-types, where the problem was that the library literally ran out of books in my childhood (they literally had to call my mum and ask if I could start reading the adult section, because I had read everything in the child and youth sections)...
[0:55:50] saga_no: I went with Disco because I figured it would be best for PvP, given that I would have to do some damage to get the heals out and thus help out a little that way
[0:56:15] NordicSorcerer: @bronloch followup, @saga_no laughed herself silly when my mum mentioned that episode in our wedding 8 years ago...
[0:56:19] Daemavand: Good that you're keeping hydrated :)
[0:56:41] Bronloch: @NordicSorcerer NICE! LUL
[0:57:06] anker_jym: We promise
[0:57:11] saga_no: @Bronloch Yeh - my parents had a fair few books, and I was allowed to read all of them from the time I was like.... 5
[0:57:11] Daemavand: It depends on what it is lol
[0:57:12] Ujai321: When do we ever make fun of you
[0:57:13] vharakh_17: monkaHmm
[0:57:18] Pathstrider: sure....
[0:57:22] dem0on1c: wE PROMISE, WINK WINK
[0:57:23] rubibeya: hazelLurk
[0:57:24] Daemavand: But we're nice!
[0:57:42] apheelia96: Good Afternoon Hazel 😁
[0:57:43] Ujai321: So you are a chef
[0:57:44] Daemavand: Oh dear
[0:57:49] saga_no: You curl your fingers under when you chop onions.
[0:57:54] jeffdmk: oh no
[0:58:03] DarkEnforcer: is her subscribe notifications turned of or is she just distracted :P
[0:58:17] saga_no: That's a great investment :)
[0:58:23] thayes523: I have one and it is great for onions
[0:58:23] Daemavand: Does Hazel now have 9 fingers
[0:58:36] Ujai321: Don't tell me the embarrassing thing is that you bought something small and practical, if a little unnecessary
[0:58:37] RavynBlackheart: those things are actually pretty cool
[0:58:38] GreenArrowed: i love my vegetable chopper. it's really good for my bad adhd weeks when i can find the energy to really prep food.
[0:58:40] fallingupwards: I love my veggie chopper
[0:58:42] averageteacup: Is it fun?
[0:58:53] Shirey12: Hello Hazel! I have a question for you, Do you think "Hero Talents" are a step in the right direction? Do you think they are close to the Covenant situation in SL? I personally think a Class Skin would be more appropriate vs extra bloat of modifiers.
[0:59:00] Daemavand: Wait, that's the story? Why in the would anyone make fun of you for that
[0:59:07] saga_no: Listen - as someone who regularly loses grip strength in my hands ... a veggie chopper like that is a godsend
[0:59:15] rubibeya: That's awesome
[0:59:20] jeffdmk: #sponsored
[0:59:28] kynlaeh: i have one and i use it for when im making a big pot of soup or something, so much more efficient the more you are chopping
[0:59:29] DoctorOgenki: use promo code HAZELCHOP to get 20% off
[0:59:31] heldtheline: new kitchen tools are always fun; it slices, it dices, it gives the serotonin
[0:59:33] wolfcloudchaser80: As someone who has worked in a hospital a bit, the strangest things lead to the more common injuries. Specifically, slicing bagels and washing glass dishes.
[0:59:37] Daemavand: That's lot of pressure for Jeff to perform, now
[0:59:47] averageteacup: I think i'll buy one ... whenever i move to my own place
[0:59:49] Bane122: Hey, guys, look at little miss slapchopper over here!
[1:00:11] GreenArrowed: i use it to prep my salads tbh. it makes for great chopped salads.
[1:00:46] saga_no: It also makes you waste less produce, apparently, because it's able to chop stuff up more than most people are - and you get more consistently sized pieces
[1:00:57] Zuldak: You could be sponsored by dayquil today
[1:01:03] fallingupwards: I'm scared to use our instapot lol
[1:01:08] Ujai321: You are not above sponsorships? I'll give you 20 bucks if you say my nft is great
[1:01:08] GreenArrowed: @saga_no yes, this has been the biggest thing for me, i'm wasting less food
[1:01:18] averageteacup: How it will work as a new weapon in WoW? :D
[1:01:32] dicemeister23: hi Hazel, you've probably answered, but why not just run Murozonds Rise lower keys for a stream? Instead of freehold
[1:01:32] Daemavand: I have to say I've always appreciated your tenancy to always read instructions for things
[1:01:41] GreenArrowed: i have an instant pot/airfryer combo, it is magical
[1:01:48] Daemavand: Because in my experience this is rare with people but shouldn't be
[1:01:48] heldtheline: @averageteacup goblins would find a way, trust me
[1:02:40] averageteacup: @heldtheline Yeah, goblin will make it work .. i love them
[1:03:29] Elrathir: Hello Hazel! Any... any parrots?
[1:03:36] anker_jym: Since you don't like character boosts, are you willing to sacrifice one for a science experiment? If not, that's totally fine
[1:04:04] Daemavand: It's because you can't make bread in an air fryer :D
[1:04:20] wolfcloudchaser80: Toaster ovens are pretty handy, and there's some that have a convection function, which essentially makes it an air fryer, too.
[1:04:21] saga_no: I wonder if Frybread can be made in an air fryer....
[1:04:27] GreenArrowed: i use my airfryer for proofing!
[1:04:34] Daemavand: A true gnome at heart
[1:04:44] anker_jym: That's okay, maybe chat knows. Does anyone know if a character boost still give you upgraded professions if you learn then on a lvl 1 character that you then boost?
[1:05:12] anker_jym: I know that's how it used to work.
[1:05:32] cashthb: I usually try to make fries in my air fryer but it's insanely hit & miss, sometime it's the greatest I ever had, sometimes it's raw, sometimes it's coal... idk man
[1:05:36] saga_no: I would assume they changed that when they introduced the new Starter Island?
[1:05:57] Octopixy1971: hazelTen hazelLove
[1:06:43] Triskelian: Maybe not, since you don't have to go through Exile's Reach if it isn't a completely new toon
[1:06:52] Daemavand: That is adorable
[1:07:05] marvin1995xo: dogshit monster ? ahha
[1:08:05] anker_jym: That's what I was thinking. I was just trying to figure out what to do for when I finally preorder TWW. Thanks chat?
[1:08:17] anker_jym: ! Not ?
[1:09:08] Octopixy1971: haha so sweet
[1:09:09] Daemavand: Omg lol
[1:09:32] Alannalouwho: lol that is sweet, i love that
[1:09:34] anker_jym: That's hilarious haha
[1:09:38] Daemavand: What a good boy! That is some intense impulse control
[1:09:50] Ryuuza930: good boy Zeus
[1:09:51] averageteacup: Kira the Boss
[1:10:26] wolfcloudchaser80: Ok, I was about to ask if he got Good Boy Treats for being so excellent.
[1:10:47] gordastico: do you still keep an aquarium? I remember, when I first started following you, that you had a super cool betta fish
[1:11:24] 7thSaga: tasnPEACH Hazel and Chat
[1:12:16] GreenArrowed: he's such an adventurer
[1:12:19] 7thSaga: fried me up some left over spaghetti i had in the fridge Kreygasm fried spaghetti and i added parmesan cheese
[1:12:19] Daemavand: .... Eat the plants
[1:12:25] Ujai321: Gotta get to 100 pounds somehow
[1:12:32] Daemavand: I don't know why this surprises me, knowing his affinity for dirt
[1:12:32] cashthb: what makes you think he wants to eat the plants?
[1:12:41] Zuldak: Hope the one eye captain is doing ok
[1:13:14] saga_no: If doggo is shoving his whole muzzle into the tank to nip at the plants - ...doggo is likely to eat them
[1:13:36] 7thSaga: whats your kitties name again? im so forgetful of names LUL and i been here for quite awhile and i wanna say Kira?
[1:13:45] Ujai321: Arrr, no wehh t' keep t' capt'n down!
[1:14:01] Daemavand: Omg lol
[1:14:02] RealDane: LUL
[1:14:03] janehomero: HeyGuys
[1:14:05] 7thSaga: jimblesDog
[1:14:17] GreenArrowed: probably. if there's a lot of salmon processing, there's probably plenty of fish emulsion excess for the parks dept
[1:14:33] jeffdmk: you want to be able to tag the final boss
[1:15:28] gordastico: is it death note inspired? LUL
[1:15:40] Ujai321: Funny, mine is "won't eat that"
[1:16:15] neimoose2: good morning all you beautiful people!! hazelWave hazelWave
[1:16:31] Octopixy1971: hazelWave
[1:16:34] Daemavand: Does enjoy the actual bath process?
[1:16:51] 7thSaga: @neimoose2 hazelWave
[1:17:11] Zuldak: Does he sing the song of his people?
[1:17:18] jeffdmk: has he tried swimming?
[1:17:37] Zuldak: His husky ancestors are disappointed
[1:18:09] gordastico: so moose never barks?
[1:19:12] wolfcloudchaser80: I think we had our pup a full year before he really barked. A few years later, he was howling at any fire trucks that passed.
[1:19:35] 7thSaga: Kira stream
[1:22:03] Triskelian: Kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty
[1:23:01] 7thSaga: nice kitty <3
[1:23:30] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, we used to call the "concered bark" a chuff.
[1:24:25] Daemavand: Dude lawn ornaments have it coming
[1:25:20] wolfcloudchaser80: Sounds so much like Finley! His first real "WHAT IS THAT?!" moment was a Santa-on-a-bicycle lawn Xmas decoration. He outright growled at that one.
[1:25:28] cashthb: now press her mount button Kira
[1:25:52] wolfcloudchaser80: And anything covered by a tarp was absolutely not to be trusted.
[1:25:57] Daemavand: I have a confession
[1:26:03] Daemavand: I found Olaf annoying
[1:26:18] Daemavand: I approve of Moose's reaction
[1:26:27] Daemavand: And that's true, good point
[1:26:35] cashthb: I saw frozen like 4 times, I don't remember a things Olaf did
[1:26:39] Zuldak: Plans to see dune part 2?
[1:26:40] Daemavand: It's Jar Jar Binks syndrome
[1:26:51] cashthb: oh yeah!
[1:27:05] saga_no: We all know who my favorite Frozen character is LUL
[1:27:21] Daemavand: Sven is the best :D
[1:27:47] Zuldak: I'm excited to see Feyd Harkonnen
[1:27:49] anker_jym: Do they do weekday matinees?
[1:28:24] Zuldak: I can see you being a hardened desert warrior
[1:28:30] heldtheline: I'd watch Dune 2 if you were in it hazelWant
[1:28:46] cashthb: lil sis got roasted 🔥 💀💀💀
[1:29:17] cashthb: how about play shai-hulud?
[1:29:25] cashthb: *playing ofc
[1:29:44] cashthb: might still need some mo cap
[1:30:01] kalithian2: good luck on the sharkbait drop, i'm guessing thats why you're here
[1:30:11] saga_no: I used to think I couldn't act - and then I had to participate in a school play (we all had to be in it) in High School and discovered it's not ...completely impossible
[1:30:24] cashthb: didn't die out after like the third book?
[1:30:24] devxmn: why does the mount drop at this boss when its not even this boss whos on the bird :(
[1:30:52] saga_no: I played like 2-3 minor background characters in the play and it was fine - ...not a lot of lines to memorize
[1:31:17] Zuldak: Frank Herbert lived in Tacoma and he wrote dune while studying erosion on north west beaches in the 60s
[1:31:25] Daemavand: Omg that happened to me too
[1:31:26] devxmn: literally just blizz being a pain :<
[1:31:31] Daemavand: I didn't figure it out for a year
[1:31:32] bigbrode: I want to be a writer for a living. It's very difficult not to be discouraged in what I'm writing about though
[1:31:37] averageteacup: this Murloc looks charming
[1:31:50] harrybabes: i used to do that with mimiron's head!!
[1:31:56] harrybabes: harryb27KirbySobbing
[1:31:56] dlllont: howdy gamers
[1:32:13] saga_no: @bigbrode Same... I get these brilliant ideas and go hard with them - for like a week... and then I get discouraged and stop
[1:32:21] Zuldak: It's great to be a writer and write half a series of books. Then you do whatever you want, right George?
[1:32:27] Daemavand: It can be paradoxically hard to find time and energy for hobbies
[1:32:37] averageteacup: I'm writer, the hardest thing about writing is sitting down and writing .. everything else easy
[1:32:40] Daemavand: I love to draw but haven't done it for months
[1:32:47] anker_jym: Do you have a favorite author?
[1:32:56] Lagnaroz: my friend farmed sindragosa from icc for long time because he thought it would drop one of the glory achievement mounts
[1:33:07] Daemavand: Yeah, I think because it requires a creative part of your brain that you're not used to using
[1:33:11] saga_no: Do you have a favorite book?
[1:33:12] Daemavand: So it takes some effort
[1:33:15] kalithian2: saw it drop only once back when BFA was current content, lost the roll on it though
[1:33:17] saga_no: Like - all-time favorite
[1:33:26] bigbrode: @saga_no yes!! Or when you sit down and immediately go blank @.@
[1:33:31] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames Is that a fantasy series?
[1:33:48] saga_no: @bigbrode I try every year to really go at it with NaNoWriMo but I never finish...
[1:33:54] heldtheline: Have you read/do you plan on reading Good Omens afterwards? Terry's novel with Neil Gaiman.
[1:34:01] anker_jym: But DO you have a favorite blank?
[1:34:06] ghostie1995: yeah I agree

[1:34:14] cashthb: who's your favourite viewer called Cash tho?
[1:34:28] averageteacup: every year i almost buy everything written by Terry Pratchett then i don't .. ok, now i'm going to buy one of his books
[1:34:41] MrSonicgen: Hello there.
[1:34:56] gordastico: have you read earthsea?
[1:35:29] saga_no: "Favorite Media consumed this month"
[1:36:18] saga_no: I have Discworld on my TBR. It's been on there since the 90s.... I still haven't been able to get through more than a couple of chapters
[1:36:52] saga_no: I've tried started with other books as well - still can't get through more than like 50 pages before I just... stop reading
[1:37:09] plainswalker75: I'd recommend Guards, Guards! as a good starting point, if you're into more classical fantasy literature
[1:38:09] beerandwaffles: what are you looking for?

[1:39:08] saga_no: Yeah and I'm a periodic reader as well, so if I don't get "sucked in" within the first 50 pages I just give up
[1:39:18] GreenArrowed: i mean, capitalism
[1:39:42] wolfcloudchaser80: That's basically how most of the streamers I've seen operate.
[1:39:55] bigbrode: I've been addicted to Dreamlight Valley lately. I gotta get some more WoW time in

[1:41:23] cashthb: I really don't recommend swallowing your morals... they mess up your tummy
[1:41:32] witchhobbit: hahahah i've been lurking, i relate
[1:41:47] averageteacup: Don't be so hard on yourself, it's hard to escape capitalism
[1:41:55] saga_no: Honestly - ...it was for my own benefit - now I know how the gift-sub thing works ;P
[1:42:01] GreenArrowed: yea, you're not forcing anyone to do anything
[1:42:02] wolfcloudchaser80: You're good at this. I enjoy this stream and it's a significant fraction of my overall media consumption, if you want to call it that. I'm motivated to seeing you continue to be successful.
[1:42:14] Daemavand: Agreed!
[1:42:17] anker_jym: Jokes on you, I'm actually 6!!....I'm jk, don't worry
[1:42:18] heldtheline: do we have to *act* like adults? hazelYikes
[1:42:26] Zuldak: Influencing isn't the same as coersing.
[1:42:35] tildo03: I serve the Dark Lord Hazel and obey her commands
[1:42:45] wolfcloudchaser80: You're finally catching on! Yay!
[1:43:00] witchhobbit: i wouldn't really consider you an influencer tho
[1:43:01] tildo03: I agree with all that you say.
[1:43:07] saga_no: I mean... Hubby (Nordic) stops by regularly because he likes the chat (and Kira); he doesn't play WoW - never has, probably never will, and he continuously mentions how nice it is in here
[1:43:26] Zuldak: You're not putting a 100 sub goal saying 'feed my dog or he starves'. That's manipulative
[1:43:53] Daemavand: Always happy to find more excuses to support you:D
[1:44:09] jeffdmk: 100 subs or hazel doesnt eat
[1:44:21] saga_no: I will :)
[1:44:22] heldtheline: regular sub goals for moose visits could be a thing
[1:44:25] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Exactly, the community vibe here is so great. Strange as it sounds, I'd stay in Hazel's chat even if Hazel wasn't here.
[1:44:45] GreenArrowed: omggg
[1:44:49] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[1:44:54] GreenArrowed: that's so funny
[1:44:58] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Same. It's the reason I stayed in here once I found it :) I was welcomed into the fray - even if I knew next to nothing about the game
[1:45:04] Octopixy1971: LUL
[1:45:23] Daemavand: Lol! You can bake them bread as an apology for delayed photos
[1:45:25] GreenArrowed: i do have a cousin that sent me a buy me a coffee payment for a newsletter i send, i didn't even know she was subbed
[1:45:29] Daemavand: Or a cake!
[1:45:29] saga_no: I started hanging out in here during the Midnight Farm era
[1:45:30] witchhobbit: i'm trying to get lord hel'nurath too lol. so far warlock has been my least fav class campaign
[1:45:36] Daemavand: Or PIE
[1:45:47] Daemavand: Also apple pie is a big thing out here.
[1:45:51] Daemavand: It's wonderful.
[1:46:03] jeffdmk: i thought you said gukk'rok for a min i am slaughtering the rare on multiple servers and someone else is too
[1:46:11] GreenArrowed: wow
[1:46:14] witchhobbit: i realized recently that the class mounts count towards the meta so i've been working on all of them
[1:46:14] GreenArrowed: tht's so expensive
[1:46:23] saga_no: Because it is Hubby and I's anniversary today; he made sure I have a chocolate donut for later - we had takeaway pizza for dinner <3 (it's windy and rainy here so we decided to Pillow Fort rather than force ourselves out on a date)
[1:46:27] witchhobbit: i have warrior, dh, monk, dk left!
[1:46:39] saga_no: I'm forever grateful I married someone who understands the concept of "ouchies. Wanna stay home"
[1:47:14] saga_no: Thank you :)
[1:47:26] GreenArrowed: @saga_no aww happy anniversary <33333
[1:47:28] Daemavand: Omg it's true! Happy anniversary!!
[1:47:31] saga_no: <3
[1:47:42] saga_no: Nordic mentioned it earlier but I think it got lost in chat, hehe
[1:47:49] Octopixy1971: @saga_no gz Saga hazelLove
[1:47:52] saga_no: and now he's playing a game on his computer
[1:48:19] Daemavand: Does she get more affectionate when you're ill?
[1:48:28] witchhobbit: i do love the legion class stuff so. much. the mission parts are the only real sore point
[1:48:32] GreenArrowed: yea, i chop my cold smoked salmon in the chopper, it's perf
[1:48:51] saga_no: How far is 'so far away' ?
[1:48:56] saga_no: Like in travel time
[1:49:04] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[1:49:11] n0haxi: this is the try i can feel it!
[1:49:18] GreenArrowed: 17% left on my vicious mount journey NotLikeThis
[1:49:37] saga_no: So you'd have to travel between the mainland and the island to see your family?
[1:50:01] cashthb: actually non troll question: can't you just fly somewhere else to do the groceries? I heard about a guy that flies from calgary and back every day 'cause the plane tickets are cheaper than a month of rent
[1:50:02] saga_no: Ah
[1:50:26] saga_no: That is pretty substantial, yeah
[1:50:42] Daemavand: Bless Canada lol
[1:50:47] Daemavand: So yeah that's two of
[1:50:52] Daemavand: *real out there
[1:51:15] Daemavand: And then you have winter.
[1:52:00] anker_jym: You're telling me you dont go clubbing?
[1:52:12] Helcon1976: you forgot the staocked fishing hole
[1:52:33] GreenArrowed: that sounds like enough
[1:52:51] saga_no: My Dad lives about 10 hours drive away - which is far... so I don't see him often, but in the area I live in, driving 2 hours to see someone or even to go to a specific mall is pretty common
[1:53:08] wolfcloudchaser80: wolfcloudchaser80 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to HazelNuttyGames's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[1:53:08] Streamlabs: wolfcloudchaser80 just gifted 1 Tier 1 subscriptions!
[1:53:08] wolfcloudchaser80: wolfcloudchaser80 gifted a Tier 1 sub to foxieloxiee! 
[1:53:47] wolfcloudchaser80: Un-official hype train!
[1:53:54] cashthb: what if there's a sharknado?
[1:53:59] saga_no: The Norwegian concept of 'cabin' means that most people here are used to driving like 2-3 hours every weekend to go to their cabin, and then return on Sunday
[1:54:01] GreenArrowed: ooh gift subs count?
[1:54:02] Daemavand: Personally speaking, I don't think I could ever love somewhere that's not walkable
[1:54:09] saga_no: @GreenArrowed They do.
[1:54:28] Daemavand: I totally get it
[1:54:28] witchhobbit: SAMEEE
[1:54:37] saga_no: You'd love where I live then, Hazel :)
[1:54:45] GreenArrowed: yes! the best thing about living across the street from central park is i can WALK tot he park, then walk IN the park for hours
[1:54:52] witchhobbit: that has been my #1 issue where i live in the city
[1:55:04] saga_no: Even in a residential area of the city - there's little nature trails everywhere that kinda makes you forget you're living in a city
[1:55:07] Daemavand: And that's a perk to cycling, it helps get to walks, because I have the same problem with Montreal
[1:55:08] wolfcloudchaser80: I was watching a streamer that was trying to get into the Twitch Partner Plus program. Had to drum up some serious new subs, but gifted and Prime subs didn't count for that.
[1:55:24] saga_no: It's absolute murder on my sinuses in spring - but it's nice that it's there
[1:55:27] cashthb: @saga_no isn't that a weird redneck thing? idk, just making assumtions from the ylvis song
[1:55:29] Saheilah: Yessss I love being able to go to parks and trails
[1:55:40] anker_jym: Random question, how's the air quality there? I live in a place where winter inversion/pollution gets pretty bad
[1:55:49] saga_no: @cashthb No it's more a flex - being able to afford a house *plus* a cabin
[1:56:01] Daemavand: I was terrified of it for years, it came out of necessity
[1:56:04] Daemavand: Aww!
[1:56:12] Saheilah: Victoria is a nice place 😊 I enjoy visiting lol
[1:56:19] Daemavand: And that's one reason I'll be visiting in the fall :D
[1:56:32] saga_no: Only places I've been to on the West coast of Canada is Banff and Calgary when I was like 4 years old
[1:56:51] foxieloxiee: @wolfcloudchaser80 Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:57:13] anker_jym: Ah, I forgot about Canadian wildfires
[1:57:19] saga_no: I remember it because the locals warned us that the blackbears had been climbing the trees outside the hotel
[1:57:34] Daemavand: Also, speaking of cycling, Amsterdam is insane and amazing for it
[1:57:38] saga_no: ...and the claw marks on the trees were *fresh*
[1:57:46] bigbrode: I'm a bit late to the profession party. Are there any catchup mechanics in place for professions in 10.2.5?
[1:58:00] wolfcloudchaser80: I bet new Prime subs count here, too... *cough*hinthint
[1:58:19] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I think they do - the first sub of the goal counter was a prime one I think
[1:58:22] DoctorOgenki: living in NYC, i havent been hit by a car while cycling (yet) but this has really been a training ground for car/bike awareness
[1:58:25] bigbrode: Ok, that's fair
[1:58:31] tildo03: I just learned that you can get normal experience doing follower dungeons :)
[1:58:57] GreenArrowed: @DoctorOgenki i'm too scared to bike here, but my friend bikes to me from BK regularly
[1:59:17] Saheilah: Victoria is so bike-able!!!! Dooooo iiiiit
[1:59:17] virro0: You are the dungeon guide lady! I remember your voice
[1:59:19] Daemavand: Yep exactly - it's always just taking that first step into doing it that's the hardest
[1:59:23] wolfcloudchaser80: @foxieloxiee You're welcome!
[1:59:41] DoctorOgenki: @GreenArrowed ya im in BK, i havnt worked up the bravery to bike in manhatten, nore do i think i ever will :D
[2:00:04] Saheilah: First step is the hardest, for sure ❤️
[2:00:04] Daemavand: Baby steps is wise <3
[2:00:12] saga_no: Baby steps is the best approach, imo
[2:00:33] saga_no: ...as someone who has gone through intensive exposure therapy to deal with panic disorder ...it was *ROUGH*
[2:00:36] Daemavand: That is also true
[2:00:38] wolfcloudchaser80: Hey, someone recognizes your voice... sounds like the sick factor is largely faded now, yup.
[2:00:38] jeffdmk: if you were to get it would that mean hearthstone?
[2:01:01] virro0: What do you guys think about the state of the game? I have like a few divorces with the game during my 16 (wtf) years playing, but this one has been longer than usual. We all good up in here or wait for Chris Metzen expansion?
[2:01:29] ivashkov92: when does the hearthstone event start??
[2:01:35] Daemavand: Gameplay
[2:01:35] ajeazy84: Do you do M+?
[2:01:37] Saheilah: I loved the announcements when I was at BlizzCon, personally 😊
[2:01:47] virro0: Chris Metzen is the leader of Blizzard and WoW. Hand drawn that shit and no one will tell me otherwise
[2:01:48] saga_no: Oh yeah - collecting - I need tips from the Hivemind: The most CLOWNY mog you can think of?
[2:01:50] virro0: Daddy Metzen
[2:02:11] saga_no: The most ridiculous looking mog
[2:02:17] witchhobbit: personally even if i'm not that happy with the story, i have lots of other things i like about the game and nothing has been bad enough for me to want to unsub
[2:02:39] virro0: I think Chris breaks that mold a little bit. Thats OG shit right there. That man cares you just know it
[2:02:46] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Run AQ40 a few times. The gear from that place was absolutely bonkers looking.
[2:02:47] virro0: He gives a damn
[2:02:47] anker_jym: @saga_no I mean, the Darkmoon Jester set is literally a clown suit
[2:02:57] heldtheline: And, if the past few years has taught us anything, we shouldn't treat anyone at Blizzard as infallible people.
[2:03:07] GreenArrowed: GreenArrowed is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to HazelNuttyGames's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel!

[2:03:08] GreenArrowed: GreenArrowed gifted a Tier 1 sub to kalithian2! 
[2:03:08] GreenArrowed: GreenArrowed gifted a Tier 1 sub to Talonias! 
[2:03:08] GreenArrowed: GreenArrowed gifted a Tier 1 sub to CatManDoh! 
[2:03:21] bigbrode: I agree. It's a witch hunter mentality to think it's as simple as making a scapegoat
[2:03:31] witchhobbit: there's so many good artists working at blizz
[2:03:39] Daemavand: Oh I didn't even notice the sub goal! Mobile is a trip
[2:03:43] saga_no: @anker_jym I have the Harlequin set - is it that one?
[2:03:44] DoctorOgenki: is there any expansion in the past you wish you played live? @HazelNuttyGames
[2:03:46] virro0: Cant fault the art guys thats or sure
[2:03:57] virro0: Some of the other departments though....
[2:04:07] forebringer: the Art team is the only one that I have absolute faith in
[2:04:19] anker_jym: @saga_no yeah, that one!
[2:04:33] witchhobbit: i think all the departments are great
[2:04:36] DoctorOgenki: oh my apologies, i thought you had started much later
[2:04:41] plainswalker75: @forebringer don't forget the music team :)
[2:04:54] witchhobbit: they all work together to make this game happen
[2:05:01] virro0: Vanilla WoW is the best game ever made and I would give away everything I have to go back FeelsBadMan
[2:05:01] saga_no: @anker_jym Allright - thanks :) I haven't been collecting that much mog, really, so I don't have the more funny looking older mog I guess
[2:05:14] ahnn112: i wish we got new on the next patch i dont like secrets
[2:05:16] ajeazy84: Whats the best xpansion and why was it Legion?
[2:05:26] forebringer: that's fair, the music and the cinematic's teams are both also good
[2:06:02] saga_no: I really liked Legion and I've only played it after the fact
[2:06:09] jeffdmk: oh i forgot that you dont like legion
[2:06:10] bigbrode: Mists of Pandaria will forever hold a special place in my heart
[2:06:19] saga_no: Only expansion I've played as current content is Shadowlands and onwards
[2:06:30] saga_no: I started in late BfA but never got to "end game" in that
[2:06:43] ajeazy84: Same I've played since release. The only xpac that made me quit for awhile was WoD
[2:06:49] ascendence94: i started shadowlands BibleThump
[2:06:55] bigbrode: Throne of Thunder was an incredible experience in its time
[2:06:59] Daemavand: I think many people feel like they should be playing WoW perpetually, and that taking a break/pause from it indicates that there's a problem
[2:07:09] virro0: My biggest wish is that they make the game simpler for the next expansion. Im tired of seeing 20 buffs on my character whenever I cast a random spell and I dont really know what any of them are. Too bloated. Take me back, Daddy Metzen god of Blizzard
[2:07:15] Daemavand: But I don't think that's the case and that pauses are fine
[2:07:32] saga_no: Pandaria is still one of my favorite zones in the game, though; and Nazjatar or whatever it was called in BfA
[2:07:34] ahnn112: i didnt quit but i explored other games in shadowlands
[2:07:35] saga_no: The underwater one
[2:07:44] cashthb: operation shieldwall, dunno what was the horde one
[2:07:56] Daemavand: Jeez we're at that many attempts eh
[2:08:21] anker_jym: @cashthb Dominance Offensive
[2:08:24] ajeazy84: I'm really enjoying p2 SoD atm
[2:08:48] Daemavand: That is true, the game has definitely evolved to becone seasonal
[2:08:57] virro0: The addition of seasons was a great idea
[2:09:16] Gurottesquex: human priest
[2:09:40] cashthb: I just don't care to hang out in the game if there's nothing to do anymore, the world lost it's magic
[2:10:21] Daemavand: And I think that's normal @cashthb , it's hard for a game that you've been playing for many years to good that same level of magic
[2:10:37] virro0: If you are in your 30s what were you doing during Vanilla and TBC? Prolly wasting your goddamn time while me and the other 7th graders were farming FeelsGoodMan
[2:10:45] virro0: Take me back, Metzen
[2:10:56] saga_no: I get the impression that people who don't play WoW think that you're super hardcore into WoW if you play it at all these days
[2:11:08] virro0: nerd!
[2:11:16] saga_no: so if you take a break you're suddenly not a "real wow player" anymore
[2:11:16] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames Any worries over the hero talents?
[2:11:23] jeffdmk: people actually did their homework?
[2:11:50] ivashkov92: haha
[2:11:56] cashthb: nah, I think it was the lore becoming complete nonsense and the design no longer being cohesive that did it for me
[2:11:58] saga_no: Have they released the Shadow Priest hero tree yet?
[2:11:58] virro0: Bruh the game is too hard now. No way most adults can be fucked to pug m+ when everything can one shot you. I hope they change that so bad :(
[2:12:00] plainswalker75: I was a freshman in college at the time, so no. ;)
[2:12:01] virro0: Im too old now
[2:12:08] Syazzi: what's oracle?
[2:12:17] tehl00py: murloc onesie! what’s the special occasion, or are we just cold? xP
[2:12:23] Syazzi: ahh i see
[2:12:39] Syazzi: that's nice they listen to community
[2:12:46] ajeazy84: Pugging M+ can definatly make you take a break for awhile lol
[2:12:48] Cyberwolffe: I'm considering maining a Holy Priest in the next expansion.  Any idea what would be a good alliance race to make my priest?
[2:13:10] Daemavand: I'm surprised you didn't just wrap your comforter around you and go full burrito :D
[2:13:14] GreenArrowed: make a dwarf!
[2:13:19] saga_no: Depending on what content you intend to focus on... there would be different preferred racials, apparently
[2:13:23] kynlaeh: i like female goblin casting animation
[2:13:25] ahnn112: i hope shadow gets something extra with xalatah
[2:13:35] saga_no: My main is a Nelf - my PvP toon is Human - both are priests
[2:13:41] GreenArrowed: i really like the warlock talents they've shown so far. i need some time to really think through the ret pally choices.
[2:13:42] Lagnaroz: i wish i could be panda on my paladin
[2:13:45] kynlaeh: i main human priest tho
[2:13:48] tehl00py: boo colds but yay comfy
[2:13:55] Daemavand: Plus there was that Evoker phase :D
[2:14:01] DoctorOgenki: i wish they would change the gnome racial from "breaks all crown control effects" to "does nothing at all" @HazelNuttyGames

[2:15:48] Daemavand: You should!
[2:15:55] Cyberwolffe: I'll have to watch the VOD since I'll be at work when self found starts  hope you have fun.
[2:15:57] saga_no: @cashthb Gotta be honest, Cash ... IDGAF.
[2:16:01] Zuldak: No palworld streams?
[2:16:01] ivashkov92: can you play selfound if you haven’t played hardcore before?

[2:16:46] cashthb: youtube series instead myb?
[2:16:53] mcxoney: how do i play self found
[2:17:36] wolfcloudchaser80: I think you could do unannounced surprise streams at unusual times. You might tap into new audiences that you can carry back to this main time slot.
[2:17:39] cashthb: there are some boring ass fights that could be abridged
[2:18:26] Zuldak: Unannounced secret streams seem to miss the point of streaming to an audience.
[2:18:28] saga_no: I've seen a couple of streamers/youtubers play BG3 on a dedicated savefile (ie - ...a special game) as a communal poll-based thing
[2:18:30] Daemavand: Yeah, it makes sense to it for things you happen to be energized for
[2:18:34] saga_no: Takes *forever* but people seem to like it
[2:19:12] saga_no: Yep
[2:19:18] saga_no: They vote on how the character looks - the name - everything
[2:19:40] saga_no: Not every conversation choice - but the major ones I think
[2:19:48] DoctorOgenki: so twitch plays BG?
[2:19:48] ahnn112: sort of random but does anyone feel like they are cheating on their main when they play on alt LOL
[2:19:48] AnarchyMoose: Twitch Plays BG3
[2:19:51] wolfcloudchaser80: There's an add-on for Twtich that presents the voting as a UI element.
[2:20:01] saga_no: like minor checks and stuff they don't put up a poll for - but yeah - the polls are short on purpose
[2:20:05] ivashkov92: wait, is Hazel going to play BG3?
[2:20:19] saga_no: I think the latter, actualy
[2:20:21] saga_no: actually*
[2:20:42] witchhobbit: ooo what are you playing in BG3?
[2:20:45] saga_no: Not 100% sure - but it appeared to be pumping out polls too rapidly for the streamer to make them themselves
[2:21:44] saga_no: It's also ...lots of fun watching the voice actors play BG3 on stream
[2:22:13] witchhobbit: nice, i recently started a ranger myself, was struggling a bit with druid
[2:22:47] Phenroi: Gloomstalker was my choice of ranger, it was VERY strong in fights
[2:23:09] Daemavand: I think I'm too impatient for BG3-style combat m
[2:23:22] saga_no: I play a Warlock in BG3 and absolutely love it; so for the new DnD campaign I made a Warlock as well
[2:23:33] witchhobbit: i had started paladin after druid and didn't mind it but i don't think it's my fav either
[2:23:49] Daemavand: Oh totally, I think it's brilliant
[2:23:52] Daemavand: But oh man lol
[2:23:58] saga_no: What I love about BG3 combat is that you can pause the game in the middle of it and nothing bad happens
[2:24:24] witchhobbit: i am way more interested in bg3 story than the combat. story mode is still too much combat for me sairaLUL
[2:24:31] LlewenNavi79: Hazel!!!!???♥️❤️💙💜💚🩵🩶🤍🤎
[2:24:52] iamtheolesen: In situations like that, you can switch to the character out of combat and move them into combat, and the rest of the combat will pause while you move them
[2:24:54] witchhobbit: i've been doing a duo playthrough which is helping
[2:25:00] saga_no: You can force-enter combat if you split the party up and have each character surprise attack - but yeah... sometimes it's a little iffy like that
[2:25:01] eielwind: i couuldn't get into BG3 no matter how hard i tried and wanted to :(
[2:25:19] AnarchyMoose: almost diggin time
[2:26:34] cashthb: there are 2 type of fights in bg 3: where I  stand behind a corner and wibe as enemies end themself on cloud of [sharp objects]; and where I just cast invisibility and pretend there's nothing to fight
[2:26:49] witchhobbit: i keep forgetting to do the archivists WQs. i guess i don't enjoy searching for them haha
[2:27:04] ahnn112: what is the green bar when you dragon fly?
[2:27:16] HazelNuttyGames: !dragonspeed
[2:27:16] Streamlabs: my dragon speed indicator is a WeakAura! link here: https://wago.io/oXqLOc7a-/8
[2:27:34] saga_no: Green bar looks to be speed
[2:28:02] AnarchyMoose: do you not do the flip up trick for dragon riding?
[2:28:24] Daemavand: Are they the kind of leftovers that get better with fine
[2:28:30] Daemavand: *time
[2:28:50] Daemavand: Yum!
[2:29:14] Kaltizdat: I'm having biryani now, haha :D
[2:29:20] Daemavand: Aye good call :D Indian is lovely
[2:29:28] cashthb: I like how leftover milk turns into chese cream! :)
[2:29:58] Daemavand: It's so diverse too, between different dishes and regions that they restaurant focuses on
[2:30:15] AnarchyMoose: name the character biryani :D
[2:30:15] Kaltizdat: What's Hazel's take on wildstalker druid talents in ww?
[2:30:34] kynlaeh: i like how indian cuisine has so many options for vegetarians
[2:31:08] Daemavand: @kynlaeh 100% and they're all so delicious
[2:31:48] saga_no: Good Indian food is fantastic - but finding *good* Indian food / restaurants here is not easy
[2:31:57] DoctorOgenki: random question, what do you do/press to dismount yourself from a dragonriding mount?
[2:32:30] Elrathir: It's been 84 years, but Fyr'alath the Dreamrender has finally dropped for me
[2:32:55] eielwind: gratz!
[2:33:20] apheelia96: Good Afternoon! Farming anything special?
[2:33:21] saga_no: I hope they'll introduce larger bags for the next expansion ;P
[2:33:41] Marmoh: Hazel how likely are you to attend next year's Glasgow's Willy Wonka's Immersive Experience?
[2:33:58] witchhobbit: when the events don't switch up well like the time rifts i feel like they're less exciting. time rifts were my fav because they rotated. but the problem was the phasing and they aren't soloable :/
[2:34:03] eielwind: i love this willy wonka mess timeline we're in
[2:34:03] saga_no: Scale of 1 to Scotland ?
[2:34:07] Marmoh: hehe
[2:34:28] witchhobbit: @Marmoh sairaLUL
[2:34:38] Daemavand: omg
[2:34:49] Daemavand: Holy nostalgia Batman
[2:34:55] cashthb: what do we mean by a handful?
[2:35:06] Daemavand: Wtf
[2:35:11] Daemavand: I would be furious
[2:35:14] Daemavand: LOL
[2:35:23] saga_no: I used to collect little figurines that came in Kinder Eggs
[2:35:23] jeffdmk: just buy a new refrigerator
[2:35:30] apheelia96: is there an efficient way to up my Dragonscale expedition renown?
[2:35:33] Chebits: yeah... kinder surprises have gotten so lame
[2:35:39] saga_no: Not the plastic toys you assemble, but there would be collectible little figures
[2:36:00] saga_no: I like the chocolate from the *eggs* - but the Kinder maxi bar is full of hazelnuts
[2:36:04] Daemavand: The fact that there's a QR code and an app for a small toy meant for children makes me die inside a bit lol
[2:36:13] lilley13: When I lived in Spain we had a shelf full of them they were so intricate and wonderful!
[2:36:27] Talonias: @GreenArrowed Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:36:48] saga_no: I can't have any nuts
[2:36:53] saga_no: Allergies
[2:37:06] Daemavand: You know what's great? Hazelnut bread. Just saying
[2:37:10] AnarchyMoose: what if you didnt like hazel nuts that would be funny LUL
[2:37:25] saga_no: So I am absolutely that person at the store who reads on every single packaging to make sure I can eat the thing
[2:37:35] saga_no: (To be clear - nuts is just *one* of the allergies ...)
[2:37:54] cashthb: speaking of bread, you ever made banana bread?
[2:38:00] apheelia96: I have to get my dragonscale expedition to renown 24 but its taking forever!

[2:38:40] xSmidsy: Hello Hazel, hello kitty <3
[2:39:05] saga_no: @RTSLightning Yeah exactly - and when you're allergic to things like malic acid, you also have to memories the E-numbers for them...
[2:39:07] AnarchyMoose: banana bread is too much like a banana. if i want to eat a banana, ill eat a banana. zuchini bread is where its at
[2:39:12] saga_no: Memorize*
[2:39:13] GreenArrowed: @Talonias yw!
[2:39:18] kynlaeh: have you ever made pumpkin or blueberry lemon bread? those are so good
[2:39:26] kynlaeh: im allergic to bananas lol

[2:39:45] Streamlabs: picklez919 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:39:45] xSmidsy: I'm good, looking for something to inspire to play retail, lost motivation for it lately :/ But watching it I adore lol. I hope you are well
[2:39:56] GreenArrowed: it's just loaf shaped muffins, which i'm here for but isn't everyones thing
[2:40:11] cashthb: what's a cake even?
[2:40:16] cashthb: is cheese cake a cake?
[2:40:42] saga_no: @RTSLightning And then there is the whole cross-reaction thing that can happen if you have both pollen and food allergies.. those are always "fun" - randomly one day you'll react to stuff you could eat the day before, and you'll be able to eat again in a day or two
[2:40:43] Kaltizdat: Next time you go to get your biryani, get na'an too. It's Central Asian bread, very dry and bready? Idk :D
[2:40:43] harrybabes: cheesecake is not a cake imo
[2:40:49] harrybabes: its an imposter
[2:40:59] apheelia96: Anybody in here know how to up DS Renown quickly or easily?
[2:41:05] cashthb: angel cake?
[2:41:06] AnarchyMoose: its a cheese, clearly
[2:41:07] ahnn112: i hate how the wq needs to be up to dande with zenata for the achieve
[2:41:12] saga_no: If the cheesecake is baked - it's cake; if it's not baked - it's a pie
[2:41:14] GreenArrowed: cheesecake is a custard
[2:41:25] apheelia96: yes dragonscale
[2:41:38] harrybabes: i love cheesecake, but when im craving "cake" i don't go to cheesecake to satiate my cravings hazelLove
[2:41:49] apheelia96: they dont have dungeons with a tabard anymore?
[2:41:58] apheelia96: darn
[2:42:04] xSmidsy: Cheese cake is just an awesome dessert. who knows why someone called it cake, maybe to inform its a dessert? Hmmmm......
[2:42:21] GreenArrowed: ugh, reminding me i need to order my bday cake before it's too late bc i'm too lazy to bake this year
[2:42:33] cashthb: well technically the old tabards still work in wotlk/cata dungeons afaik
[2:43:12] apheelia96: tyvm hazel hazelLove
[2:43:23] kynlaeh: yesterday for my bday my partner made a 7 layer chocolate cake with chocolate chips on the outside and then a raspberry/strawberry syrup to go with it
[2:43:26] GreenArrowed: is it brooklyn blackout?
[2:43:43] Daemavand: Now I'm considering getting cake >.>
[2:43:44] plainswalker75: Lemon cake with raspberry jam filling!
[2:43:56] saga_no: I'm boring and will opt for something simple like a donut or a brownie ;P
[2:43:58] witchhobbit: sounds amazing
[2:44:01] GreenArrowed: i'm indecisive so i get something based on who else is going to eat it. probably carrot cake this year.
[2:44:03] Phenroi: funfetti cake with chocolate funfetti frosting is mu go to birthday cake
[2:44:25] kynlaeh: it was quite chocolatey and i will say it made an excellent breakfast this morning, not the most nutritious tho lol
[2:44:33] Daemavand: I'm already in pjs for an early night buuuuut cake lol
[2:44:40] apheelia96: I have been craving sara lee french strawberry cheesecake for weeks now!
[2:44:49] Daemavand: I'm in a hotel
[2:45:13] saga_no: Nordic loves a type of apple pie from a takeaway place we have here (actually the place we get pizza from), but I can't have it (cuz apples...) - so I get a donut instead :)
[2:45:14] kynlaeh: speaking of carrot cake, a bakery near me does a carrot cake with shaved coconut and caramel drizzle on it and i’m intrigued to try it
[2:45:22] Daemavand: And normally I don't keep any sweets of any kind in my home actually, because I have no self control
[2:45:30] GreenArrowed: @apheelia96 oooooh i haven't had one of those in years
[2:45:34] Daemavand: But emergency mug cake is wise!
[2:45:36] averageteacup: Food taste better in mugs .. why? :D
[2:45:57] apheelia96: @GreenArrowed i know right
[2:45:59] GreenArrowed: @Daemavand same! i've been sick and my new job sent me FOUR PINTS of ice cream and i've just been going crazy eating ice cream all week.
[2:46:04] cashthb: why wouldn't I go out in my pajamas? also I'd argue most people wouldn't call it a pajama in the first place
[2:46:18] Zuldak: The butt torch. It lights your butt on fire when sheethed
[2:46:20] Marmoh: Do you agree that soggy deserts are the best?
[2:46:34] harrybabes: is self found out today? harryb27KirbyStarWow
[2:46:44] Daemavand: @greenarrowed ice cream is my favorite, I would devour those all in like 2 days, may the force be with you lol
[2:46:58] saga_no: I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't particularly like ice cream
[2:47:06] GreenArrowed: like a poke cake? or tres leche
[2:47:20] Daemavand: A classic soggy dessert I can think of is pudding chomeur
[2:47:22] virro0: Just drop by and you guys are talking about moist, creamy components
[2:47:30] kynlaeh: do you like crème brûlée?
[2:47:34] Marmoh: Oooo a bonus stream hazelShiny
[2:47:34] harrybabes: harryb27KirbyShowLove heck yeah
[2:47:37] apheelia96: soggy is not my favorite texture lol
[2:47:51] Daemavand: @saga_no I know lots of people who don't!
[2:48:04] GreenArrowed: yes
[2:48:07] apheelia96: exactly
[2:48:10] GreenArrowed: like cereal that's sat for too long
[2:48:13] saga_no: @Daemavand People here just look at me in horror when I decline their offer of ice cream
[2:48:27] Daemavand: Paul Hollywood has fried y it into my brain that soggy bottoms are blasphemy
[2:48:44] cashthb: i think of like a tiramisu when some1 says soggy dessert
[2:49:00] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Heretic!
[2:49:01] vildusten: ah tiramisu
[2:49:02] vildusten: so good
[2:49:03] witchhobbit: tiramisu is the best!
[2:49:04] kynlaeh: i would argue some cereals taste better after about a minute of sitting but only certain ones
[2:49:17] apheelia96: they have to make friends with Captain Crunch if you dont want to tear up the roof of ur mouth
[2:50:07] jeffdmk: what time is the bonus stream i dont want to mess up my watch streak
[2:50:09] Daemavand: It's very sugary, I find
[2:50:11] saga_no: Peanutbutter balls as cereal - I think
[2:50:20] GreenArrowed: it's so sweet
[2:50:30] kynlaeh: my fave cereal is maple raisin bran
[2:50:53] GreenArrowed: there's a pb version, yea. but otherwise it's jsut sweetened corn puffs int he shape of arm floaties and sometimes "berries"
[2:50:58] witchhobbit: love it
[2:51:08] witchhobbit: those 2h maces are great
[2:51:31] GreenArrowed: get some rest!
[2:51:34] Daemavand: Rest well! And take care all!
[2:51:40] apheelia96: NOOOO i was late! my fave streamer has the shortest streams
