[1:14:58] Aquadriel: no classic shit on retail pls
[1:15:44] bruhSit_farmer: people form friendships through complaining about the game with retail :P
[1:15:58] Shrenko: Blizzard added alot of stuff that prevent social interactions
[1:16:21] MrFuzzynuts420: retail is more social than classic is for me, i found way more friends and discord in retail

[1:16:58] bruhSit_farmer: no ap
[1:17:03] Exodeo_: they need to carry on with the realm merges too
[1:17:05] Pallananana: The thing is... if people have the option to 'not have to talk to somebody' to do something... they'd rather do that
[1:17:09] Korupcija_: it would work if loot was actually interesting
[1:17:15] Greencaps07: the addons messed up the social part of the in game talk more than blizz
[1:17:17] neverbornlucky: just give us lfgroup dungeon finger in tbc
[1:17:19] bruhSit_farmer: I think lack of loot was because they were predicting a longer tier
[1:17:20] Medobolt: there is nothing to take from classic KEKW
[1:17:21] xHukk: people like classic because they don't care for retail. they are 2 different games. Don't make them alike.
[1:17:23] MrFuzzynuts420: it was classic andies that loved the less loot shit
[1:17:27] Retreatless: king's honor friend

[1:22:01] plumpus81: yeah, lots of network connections
[1:22:03] Bulgogiprince: I had the same issues for Cohh yesterday

[1:24:12] deadman385: It can’t be tyrannical since you need keys for it
[1:24:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: throw out Storming too
[1:24:20] PadidinJones: @Towelliee we should do that on stream!
[1:24:20] I_DoctorSatan_I: get that trash outta here
[1:24:21] Greencaps07: what if they remove tyrannical and do a rage thing for bosses at 50%
[1:24:25] Aquadriel: @Towelliee if you complete a dungeon that helps someone's score to increase you get something (i think more score)
[1:24:42] Lutzy81: you get bonus valor for helping at least one person increase their score
[1:24:45] mrblond5: yea u will never get in a group as low score LUL
[1:24:47] Sollice: @I_DoctorSatan_I Well they kind of fixed storming right? Once the tornado hits someone it goes away?
[1:24:53] PvtHudson093: @Aquadriel extra VP
[1:25:17] Aquadriel: @Towelliee you get extra Valor if you beat a dungeon and someone in the group gets their score raised.
[1:25:30] PvtHudson093: But no point in extra VP because its weekly capped
[1:25:39] PrimalRain: towHAMUP

[1:26:15] PadidinJones: UP AND ATEM BITCHES!
[1:26:16] Sollice: Sylvannas will "die" but not really. Again we will defeat her "bad soul" and we will release her "good soul". Her good soul will probably go to Ardenweald? Maybe Maldraxass because she was a solider
[1:26:20] PadidinJones: and all the things

[1:26:51] MrGattz: one day the multi billion dollar company that is twitch will have a working website. its not today.
[1:26:57] Aquadriel: i hope her soul goes to a fucking toilet in the maw @Towelliee
[1:27:19] flebbooo: @parsa1234567 If we get 9.2 by November atleast there is a possiblity but anything past that probably not
[1:27:32] I_DoctorSatan_I: she can go back to Silvermoon
[1:27:47] PadidinJones: But shes also dead so many times how can her soul get accepted when shes kind of a voldermort
[1:27:49] Sollice: That's an option too Towelliee. Either way she isn't going to die and her story maybe for now will be over....but that have to keep her in reserve for future expansions
[1:28:09] Sollice: @PadidinJones Because her soul was shattered. We have been fighting the bad part of her for years
[1:28:09] inteus82: @Aquadriel apparently you only know the bad side of sylv
[1:28:19] neverbornlucky: i would sign up but i am only level 50
[1:28:42] Kasern: Same reason we got LFG. They were putting all this work into making dungeons and not everyone was seeing them

[1:29:54] Aquadriel: same lmao
[1:29:56] Sollice: Yeah that needs a skip
[1:30:00] Sollice: We have done it so many times now
[1:30:01] Blah206: lol blizzard gave tbc exactly 1 month. that's about the break I needed from retail
[1:30:03] PToastman: Hate it so much

[1:30:22] aikopooh: spriest are pumping good dmg
[1:30:28] Trexxter: our guild is doing 2x Mag and Gruul raids simultanuous and 5 Kara groups
[1:30:33] Greyborn1: Was weird there was no skip when storywise your main cranked open SL with portals
[1:30:34] inteus82: @Aquadriel ahh one of the .. ahh wait they are all like you lol..
[1:30:37] I_DoctorSatan_I: Alleria and Vereesa Windrunner should honestly use their powers to capture Sylvanas's "bad soul" and trap it in a vessel from Ardenweald and Sylvanas should return to Silvermoon as a Ranger General. She has no quarle with anyone after she's beaten, unless, she visits Arthas one last time.

[1:34:52] neverbornlucky: towelliee did you watch the tailisin video talking about rerolling legendaries for 9.1
[1:34:52] Deadelus0: @Sollice you need renown 44 so yes
[1:34:59] neo_0098: yeah flying in the 4 original zones wheres no reason to come back to
[1:35:00] Aquadriel: Sollice tied to renown and campaign chapter.
[1:35:04] WochiTV: it is unlocked on week 2 at renown 45
[1:35:04] lumaday: I think we can only get 42 first week
[1:35:09] PadidinJones: I think its reknown 42 or 44
[1:35:10] Deadelus0: You need 44 renown with A covenant
[1:35:13] Aquadriel: Sollice so wait to change AFTER you unlock it.
[1:35:15] Greyborn1: is renown catchup changed at all?
[1:35:17] Sollice: Ok. So if if I switch does flying get taken away?
[1:35:17] Unciatim: flying is tied to renown....
[1:35:20] executeru: what happened to your paladin towlie? havent followed wow for some time now
[1:35:25] Aquadriel: Sollice dont think so.
[1:35:26] luckfore: no it doesnt go away
[1:35:28] PadidinJones: And you need to finish the quests
[1:35:37] Sollice: OK cool ty. Yeah so I will wait to unlock then switch
[1:35:44] PadidinJones: Its account wide
[1:35:45] luckfore: once you unlocked it its unlocked foever on yor chars
[1:35:49] PadidinJones: thats what it was in PTR
[1:35:52] NalinA: Pretty sure we get 3 per week
[1:35:53] BigNickM: BigNickM subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[1:35:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: @inteus82 I know everything including the armor and Frostmourne came from The Jailer's balcksmiths, but still, it was Arthas, ultimately, yes, it's was the Jailer all the long, but, she realizes this. Why she hasnt figured it out, not sure why she's playing along IF she does know he was ultimately behind it all.
[1:36:14] aikopooh: wonder will there be renown catch up ? any news on that
[1:36:21] soulbr0: How do you already have flying if the cap is 40
[1:36:26] Sollice: Well when does flying unlock? What week? I thought there was massive reknown catchup starting tomorrow
[1:36:28] mrblond5: Arthas is coming back that i am 99 % sure

[1:37:18] PadidinJones: Or a Druid
[1:37:22] neverbornlucky: 9 deaths so far in that condo that fell down in florida
[1:37:38] MrSlugSnail: sadge
[1:37:38] Sollice: @executeru 9.1 they I guess take the most damage of any tank?

[1:38:02] RiskyBusines_ez: whats he doing in +9 dos
[1:38:08] PadidinJones: I wish there was more Bwansamdi this expac
[1:38:10] Sollice: Trying to get the trinket
[1:38:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: @inteus82 It would be interesting to see if Sylvanas pulls a N'Zoth on The Jailer. She gets used and abused but flips the script on their captor. And with Anduin, she's begining to see how "Arthas" became how he became, so, she might be just taking "notes" to see how she and everyone else could be turned by The Jailer.
[1:39:07] Wildside1177: Does the raid come out tomorrow too?

[1:39:40] Wildside1177: OK cool. I have to figure out what classs to play. Hunter is just not fun at all anymore.
[1:39:45] Sollice: Oh itsnext week? nice
[1:39:55] luckfore: mythic is in 2 weeks
[1:39:57] MrGattz: @Exodeo_ yeah iv pretty much just stopped trying to fix it. it doesnt seem like its gonna go away
[1:40:00] I_DoctorSatan_I: Hunters = C-Tier now BibleThump
[1:40:12] inteus82: @I_DoctorSatan_I i def dont think sylv char arc is over yet, or there would be no reason to see her "good" soul. so more to come imo.
[1:40:27] liberategeorge: interrupting is a tank and healer problem :)
[1:40:27] Lollerask: is necrotic changed to every other hit? is it better now?
[1:40:28] sakura_2020: ah man i cba with twitch today every stream is buffing so much
[1:40:28] elandura: Hi Toelly, are you switching to guard dru in 9.1 ?
[1:40:29] obeytwo: for the bow！
[1:40:33] Ariea_Whisper: @towelliee ran over 30 ToP and didn’t see a single trinket drop for my lock, good luck!
[1:40:34] Armdel: normal/heroic on the 6th and mythic on the 13th
[1:40:37] mrblond5: Arthas is going to kill Sylvanas again LUL
[1:40:51] Zettabyte: why is my TBC classic beta getting updated? KEKW
[1:40:54] Alepouditsa: man there much be a lot of ppl in twitch today if it lags like this
[1:40:56] neverbornlucky: so many people going to have to reroll legendaries after patch 9.1
[1:41:25] Sollice: Yeah dont remind me. I need to do Torghast today to get as much soul ash as possible
[1:41:29] I_DoctorSatan_I: @inteus82 From the community, i think she's a drawn out character that needs a break in the chain. If she survives (which is pointing out to be that way), no way she's going past 9.2. May not killer her off, per se, but, maybe a break like Khadgar.
[1:41:35] obeytwo: winrunner handover the bow
[1:41:47] noway137: did DKs get fcked in 9.1?
[1:41:52] I_DoctorSatan_I: no
[1:41:52] mrblond5: All main characters from Warcraft 3 are in Shadowlands just thing about it
[1:41:57] Sollice: @I_DoctorSatan_I Thats what they are going to do. Like you said Khadgar or Illidan. She wont be gone forever
[1:42:13] mrblond5: think*
[1:42:14] I_DoctorSatan_I: DK's are Fury Warrior's with wings LUL
[1:42:19] Shirey36: are we thinking bears are going to stay nf or go venth and double down on invarnation for M+?
[1:42:20] I_DoctorSatan_I: DH's*
[1:42:21] inteus82: @I_DoctorSatan_I well thrall got a break =) so can she
[1:42:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: true ^
[1:42:28] noway137: i heard they kept talking about nerfing AMZ, did that happen?
[1:42:31] I_DoctorSatan_I: that's what im thinking
[1:42:48] Sollice: I want to play my DH but I do not like the fel rush piece being part of my rotation
[1:42:50] I_DoctorSatan_I: Unholy DK, great for M+
[1:42:51] Swiftytrigger: arent warriors like poop
[1:42:51] Sollice: I am bad at it
[1:43:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Swiftytrigger Not at all, Fury is looking good for 9.1
[1:43:13] Fensmarken: as far as I am told - DPS-warriors are looking too strong to bring a prot-warrior
[1:43:44] Swiftytrigger: i meant warrior tanks, fury warrior is top 3 for raiding as of right now

[1:47:11] mrblond5: good question are we going to need any achievements for flying ?
[1:47:17] AceOfTheNorth: Its probably better for Blizzard to have that influx of players for a X.1 patch. Keeps the community relatively healthy in number across 2 patches than just 1

[1:48:13] Oldduketree007: Eu
[1:48:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Sollice so, if Sylvanas is going to take a break (theory), I'm really currious what she's do in her time of absence. But the big question remains, will she still be a Banshee or will she be returned as a normal Highborn Elf stripped of her banshee powers. But to think, the only person that can change her back, is the Jailer, correct? Plus, what about the Valkyir, her "soul" is bound to them. So, if they die, she dies.
[1:48:14] Deadelus0: nope, it's every stream

[1:48:36] magemaster225: I could see people who switch covenants right away but not farming the 40 renown having a bad time because they wouldnt unlock the quest

[1:56:20] Wildside1177: Those are people like me. They hate M+ and do it only because they have to. They are getting their 1 run in. So hard to be good at something you hate doing.
[1:56:24] Exodeo_: char name spelling xD

[1:59:00] I_DoctorSatan_I: Ion pretty much confirms Sylvanas won't die off in 9.1. "I am looking forward to seeing the community discuss and dissect as they try to figure out what's next for her."
[1:59:10] Ambersulfr: If you don't have KSM already, it's probably not happening for 9.0
[1:59:11] Oldduketree007: depends on how much time you wanna spend @iparanoo like I said 12 hr a day last week for me since I really wanted it

[1:59:29] Ambersulfr: This has been the longest downtime between patches EVER. If you couldn't swing it before now, it's probably not happening.
[1:59:31] mrblond5: If u let the community decide the story we are doomed LUL
[2:00:14] Ambersulfr: smoking pot and taking naps?
[2:00:21] Bombayshow: crying about covid?&
[2:00:23] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Bombayshow true, just like how Jaina and Khadgar have been dormant. Something huge is coming and it will revolve around Sylvanas is my bet.

[2:05:30] SLOPEiZ: @pyromancer001 yes in current dungs and raids yes
[2:05:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: Smart M+ score to lvl up your M+ gear through Valor is 1700 rating. 2k for KSM, bit that's a difference of 4 item levels. 1700 = 242 ilvl, 2k = 246 ilvl. I think majority of players will try to attain 1700 in the long run.
[2:05:38] lincolnraz98: Ad not bad

[2:39:02] AceOfTheNorth: I personally agree that gambling shouldn't be advertisable, including lotteries.
[2:39:04] Chris_Rye: US it's illegal
[2:39:08] akia03: ya they love to gamble but cant show any of it to under 18s
[2:39:13] rhodeos_: morning, whats with the new bar on the bottom right?
[2:39:53] PreviousFate: Not every EU country has it the same.. gambling is 100% legal in here.. and sports gamble is even ok for under 18
[2:40:25] grapyz: have you heard about the new indiana jones movie happening. HYPED
[2:40:28] WarhoundUK: @PreviousFate where are you from?
[2:40:30] mrblond5: yea well they should remove the 13 + on twitch and make it 18 +
[2:40:34] AceOfTheNorth: I'm all fine with gambling existing. I just don't think it should be an ad shown to others.
[2:40:54] manmower: as long as they aren't constantly showing it to underaged folks
[2:40:59] Unciatim: jesus... Twitch need to get their shit together

[2:41:37] Mr_Adam420: gambling like everyone knows what it is you can go to the store and get a scratch off i dont see a problem with it being on twitch. hot tubs tho? mmm idk about those but yea
[2:41:45] grapyz: I remeber when Justin.tv was popular
[2:41:54] mrblond5: The problem is not the slot machines , the problem is that is on a 13 + streaming site
[2:41:57] grapyz: OH snap I didnt mean to post a link lmao
[2:42:02] AceOfTheNorth: Poker isn't gambling. Its a skill based game
[2:42:24] manmower: @Mr_Adam420 someone could combine those two and make bank
[2:42:36] DudeInARobe: @AcePhoenyx you're joking right? lol
[2:42:38] akbartheiv: Oh ofcourse it’s gambling, I don’t know anyone who says it isn’t. My point is that someone to just say it’s gambling and nothing positive, that’s just wrong
[2:42:39] Mr_Adam420: @AcePhoenyx uhh it is LUL
[2:42:41] dreamwalker213: @fnbre so are hot tub streams

[2:43:02] Buckwink: the site xqc won a million dollars on is 100% a scam
[2:43:02] AceOfTheNorth: Poker is legally defined as gambling, its skill based though, there are no odds against you
[2:43:04] mavericks312: MJ said it best fuck them kids
[2:43:05] 0doz: ppl bitching about gambling for a +13 platform.. but they dont do shit against the smoking or drinking streams ..lol

[2:43:21] Mr_Adam420: @manmower has5
[2:43:24] akbartheiv: Poker is less gamble than slots. But 100% gambling
[2:43:25] TheNorthernGiant: Nobody was against it
[2:43:26] AceOfTheNorth: Poker is no more gambling than paying to enter any sporting tournament and people do that all the time

[3:35:03] Llamatude: @Sollice not if he keeps a texas residence as his "main" place
[3:35:08] crawcook: Must be significant other or maybe he has some business relations that he wants to be closer to.
[3:35:27] Sollice: Yeah but I dont know if he kept his apt there or he did a full move
[3:35:30] Masqerader: Maybe he just wants to go to the beach?
[3:35:31] capricore: Tax situation LUL at Max’s income, hire a CPA and your golden
[3:35:39] scartotem: @Sollice Full move

[3:35:49] HilariousMax: Depends on the timing of the eyes
[3:35:52] Sollice: Moving from Florida back to Ohio Katie and I lose 800 a month in taxes. I could only imagine what its like to move to CA
[3:36:07] Llamatude: as well he can just have a LLC based in texas and show no income personal.
[3:36:24] Deathkanigit101: He probably is in family alpha
[3:36:32] I_DoctorSatan_I: try living in the Common Wealth of Virginia FailFish

[3:37:21] crawcook: for riot
[3:37:28] purfessorplum: I wish FF14 would redo the ARR quest chain, I heard you get way more XP now but I couldn't make it past the 10k quests, half of which are run 30min here, say Hi and then run 30min back etc etc.

[3:41:18] Aquadriel: threads is good if you tank or healer, otherwise i found better to do story line until like 56 then go threads.
[3:41:25] macanudo17: @towelliee shadow priest alt? Or just trying it out
[3:41:38] fistofnature: yep night fae is best

[4:52:23] ArcaneSyntax: I honestly really like Renown as a system? It's basically a season pass, but it's permanent and you can catch up super easy.
[4:52:27] nocturnal_2195: @lollerask yes
[4:52:29] Manabucho: @Towelliee cant wait to play with gushing wounds again :)

[4:54:32] vashaun: when does the new raid go live?
[4:54:34] PvtHudson093: A lot of us will be stuck with heroic ilvl gear unless you raid mythic
[4:54:38] swordart_19: @cerealkillas what you said makes 0 sens, for next level of legendary you need mats to make it so why not make new one instead nothing changes
[4:54:40] kowaikoro: 5 domination slots pepelaugh

[4:55:10] swordart_19: @cerealkillas You can keep having your level 4 and not upgrade 4Head
[4:55:10] kaze171: but scokets dont work in dungeons right?
[4:55:20] Swiftytrigger: what if you're a curve raider but you go for ksm? do you think the lower ilvl dom pieces are still gonna be better?
[4:55:23] kraydom: They do
[4:55:26] xUrb4n: nothing to shake a stick at
[4:55:32] Jarlan23: i thought they only worked in the maw and raid
[4:55:33] PvtHudson093: @kaze171 the effects do but not the set bonus

[4:56:20] PvtHudson093: 50% less effective
[4:56:22] ArcaneSyntax: ya know what? I'm cool with M+ players having to do raid for domination gear.
[4:56:29] Easymode: i just want tier sets back soon towRee
[4:56:32] swordart_19: Na t having sockets never stopped anyone getting best rewards
