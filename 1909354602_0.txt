[8:01:15] PokeMattTCC: I queued up spy music in my mind just now
[8:01:22] Deathleta: Swifty might still be the reason why blizzard nerfs the game LUL I love it
[8:01:26] hiraethonhs: i mean even if there are griefers in cave u can just skip cave and kill 10 mobs
[8:02:02] khleavage: That is a rough one, hopefully they dont fall short on that. It will ruin HC servers
[8:02:26] Boopermans: swifty why do i keep getting like 10 ads in a row from you :S?
[8:02:35] N_Tys: whats the grief?
[8:02:49] khleavage: Oh absolutely, one thing I loved about the blizzard non controlled HC was if something happened I could contest it
[8:02:53] Dakaa: they should just perma banned all accounts the griefer has
[8:03:00] SomethingElemental: But how do you know the difference between grief and just getting killed in pvp?
[8:03:02] Dakaa: all accounts that share the same sessions
[8:03:05] Âè£Ë´ñ: Havent seen 1 griefer tbh, playtime around 25hrs
[8:03:12] smallgiantx: there was ppl in the goldtooth cave doing that aswell
[8:03:23] hiraethonhs: only grief in this lvl is standing in front and hope u flag them
[8:03:24] Dakaa: gotta hit them where its going to hurt
[8:03:28] snow51rum: well you're ahead then

[8:05:25] hiraethonhs: u need like 10 spiders to kill 2 players lol
[8:05:38] BrutalBarbie268: Maybe the group remembers the name? maybe you can /target playername
[8:05:38] khleavage: One thing that concerned me with blizzard running it is the fact that you cant really contest a death
