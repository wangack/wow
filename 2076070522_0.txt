[4:28:26] Xzanelol: That + epic healing shield
[4:28:27] Crystallize007: depends if you care about speed or only healing really
[4:28:29] layziep: Nas is like
[4:28:35] layziep: ziqoPls ziqoPls
[4:28:41] Xzanelol: dagger should be pvp prio
[4:28:43] BlueZense: no xD
[4:28:54] harrisbueller: ziqo I saw your YouTube video about filling out job apps to raid gnomer. itâ€™s so sad that sod turned in to parse hungry raid leaders. no sense in it
[4:28:57] bannangarang: @layziep yessirrrrr
[4:29:00] physiczx1: @Ziqoftw melee hunter still best for pve? bm?
[4:29:06] DaaamnTV: ziqoHmm ziqoHmm
[4:29:11] murxll99: what?
[4:29:13] ajchimica: dagger is pvp BiS for healer
[4:29:14] sillenffs: @physiczx1 mele rune/bm talent
[4:29:43] physiczx1: and just stay melee @sillenffs ?
[4:29:44] shadowthehedgehog97: its always been like that
[4:29:48] Aktz_: 100% they would
[4:29:53] sillenffs: @physiczx1 yes
[4:29:55] bannangarang: people were parsing before gdkp
[4:29:56] layziep: It's just the atmosphere of mmos now
[4:29:56] agixtated: especially on crusader strike
[4:29:58] DaaamnTV: gdkp would be nice but would need to ELIMINATE bots
[4:30:00] asfjordy: i think its bc blizz made this raid so comp dependent for a smooth run
[4:30:01] Woooshy: they were like this before the gdkp change
[4:30:03] SippinSimpSyrup: They would be
[4:30:05] candlecan: sweaty nerds are always sweaty. rule of the universe
[4:30:10] Copiumpusher: na its the new trend
[4:30:14] Copiumpusher: homeboys tryna act
[4:30:17] harrisbueller: itâ€™s sad though like why make it impossible for trade chaters dps mostly to find a group. makes the game impossible.
[4:30:22] Toastedyogurt: its hard because nobody wants to be in a group that takes hours just to end up 5/6. but no reason to be super sweaty about it
[4:30:32] layziep: ziqoJAM ziqoJAM ziqoJAM
[4:30:34] raycroft: my best pugs have been the ones with the lowest standards
[4:30:50] jakeiszerocool: i only did 8% less DPS since nerf on DW melee, but i have epic fist too full BM @Ziqoftw
[4:30:57] calebbellis: can we see build please
[4:30:57] jujujay_myalias: Difference is in a properly organized gdkp you can have no logs but the requirements are budget related really
[4:31:02] KioskHasse: I never join pugs on priest if I cant roll on caster loot :) but healing priests are rare so I can demand it.
[4:31:09] Toastedyogurt: boss lockout would be awesome
[4:31:10] Crystallize007: correct take
[4:31:10] bannangarang: lockout per boss would be better
[4:31:13] SippinSimpSyrup: Fuck bots, gdkp is just pay to win. Any pay to win aspect is trash.
[4:31:16] danparsonss: yeah but they people will ninja leave
[4:31:16] Aviin: the lockouts in retail leads to half the raid leaving after every boss
[4:31:19] surfawave: alot of truth there
[4:31:21] YermGames: song?
[4:31:23] PutridFart: just nerf the bossess so its even more faceroll
[4:31:26] danparsonss: i think thats opening a door tosomething worse
[4:31:30] j03seph: fr
[4:31:38] harrisbueller: trying to get a run in agents of brill is impossible to though haha

[5:18:17] chillyt616: that is for sure the strat
[5:18:20] SirNeshorn: exactly
[5:18:28] SirNeshorn: no, you only take every other one
[5:18:34] conswaelo: lol

[5:18:40] SirNeshorn: no, you just move
[5:18:43] chillyt616: and have every1 else jsut stand there
[5:18:47] Qrucials: there is a 1 mover strat btw, but its a bit gigabrain for this group potentially
[5:19:43] SirNeshorn: The one-mover strat isnt really big brain. 1 - The mage stands the furthest out, when he gets targeted, he blinks into the melee group and the arc lightning goes into melee.
[5:20:09] SirNeshorn: 2 - The mage who got targeted stays in melee for next arc lightning, now the next one will go to the ranged. THEN the mage moves out again to take the next.
