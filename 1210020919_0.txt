[0:26:24] crashoverride_gaming: After seeing the tier sets I might get back on the Pali or destro lock at some point.
[0:27:23] Zivs: this song tho
[0:27:25] Kisswani: yeah lock set bonus is awesome , the set itself looks terrible tho KEKW
[0:27:34] Kisswani: F

[0:27:45] Collected1: banned
[0:27:54] Juniorc954: Somebody call the search team, i think he fell in
[0:27:54] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani To be fair, none of the are exquisite by any means
[0:27:55] shimwood: RIP
[0:28:10] galdrelvolkfire: Whats going on here
[0:28:24] crashoverride_gaming: Yeah. But I am torn on destro or affliction but I just love destro. But affliction gonna hurt 9.2
[0:28:41] Zivs: you can play both EZ
[0:28:51] crashoverride_gaming: True
[0:28:59] Kisswani: @SeckSymbols I like the druid , Pally , and priest sets . oh and rogue is sick as well
[0:28:59] Zivs: no covenant restriction anymore
[0:30:14] MrTerkyMan: angelthump
[0:30:18] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani They're all so incredibly basic though, the only cool thing is the whited out rogue face
[0:30:59] Kisswani: I will still use my Mythic ToS set anyway KEKW but yeah . they could be better for sure .
[0:31:10] SeckSymbols: They are easily the weakest of Shadowlands
[0:31:36] SeckSymbols: But hey, at least they put effort in the store xmog 🙄

[0:31:57] crashoverride_gaming: I’d like them better looks wise if I could (wait for it)………dye the colors towTinfoil
[0:32:01] Kisswani: ngl , I bought the store mog *hides in shame *
[0:32:06] Gingerprimer: @crashoverride_gaming also destor looks acutaly insane with that tier 4bonus with double leggo if you run the wilfred one
[0:32:11] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani You're a part of the problem
[0:32:17] Kisswani: meh
[0:32:37] Gingerprimer: @Kisswani I support you if it can be bought with ingame gold I do not really care about store stuff
[0:32:52] crashoverride_gaming: @gingerprimer yeah the destro 4 piece caught my attention lol
[0:33:03] Kisswani: my only problem with it honestly was the timing . the timing was aweful . dont reallly care about the store stuff otherwise
[0:33:20] SeckSymbols: I'd be fine with it if they put as much effort into their in game models as they did store models. I can almost guarantee they spent twice as much time on the store xmog than they did on the entirety of the tier sets
[0:33:39] Zivs: 'guarantee' btw
[0:33:46] Kisswani: come on now . that's just nonsense . There are a TON of better looking sets in game
[0:33:52] Srdjan91: @SeckSymbols true lol
[0:33:53] SeckSymbols: Not recently
[0:33:53] Kisswani: this argument never stands imo
[0:33:53] theDirtyon3: the Mythic tiers sets actually look good so its whatever
[0:33:59] Calphurnious: @Gingerprimer That is even worse since they make even more money
[0:34:02] ShleppyGaming: !ui
[0:34:02] kronnnotv: BibleThump
[0:34:05] Zivs: the store set doesn't even look that amazing it just has some special effects that makes it fancy
[0:34:11] theDirtyon3: ^
[0:34:15] Kisswani: YEP
[0:34:31] theDirtyon3: Dont listen to the masses kids
[0:34:36] crashoverride_gaming: I just think if we could dye gear it would make a lot of people happy. That’s just me though
[0:34:46] Kisswani: @crashoverride_gaming that would be great
[0:34:51] SeckSymbols: Its not a matter of if it looks amazing or not, its the fact that its much more detailed and looks to have had more time spent on it as a result
[0:35:03] SeckSymbols: You can dislike how something looks and it still be more detailed than something else

[0:36:21] ShleppyGaming: !addon
[0:36:41] feherlofia123: are there any new systems in 9.2 ... because theres too many already
[0:36:54] SeckSymbols: @feherlofia123 We know hardly anything about 9.2 at this point
[0:36:55] ShleppyGaming: Can someone post the command for his UI please
[0:37:00] theDirtyon3: @feherlofia123 WoWhead has all that info my dude
[0:37:06] galdrelvolkfire: You mean like the Box of Many Things system? Yes
[0:37:08] Erielle04: !UI
[0:37:13] Kisswani: @xShleppyx dont think it works anymore unfortunately
[0:37:22] ShleppyGaming: Ah ok thanks
[0:37:36] magemaster225: rumor that WoW might be announced for consoles at game awards
[0:37:48] SeckSymbols: What crazy tming
[0:37:49] feherlofia123: i can only imagine someone joining wow for the first time now catching up to all that renown, cobduit, leggos and pvp gear if they are a pvper
[0:37:53] theDirtyon3: @magemaster225 theres no way
[0:38:02] feherlofia123: id play it on console for sure
[0:38:02] SeckSymbols: Subs start dipping, lets NOW release on consoles
[0:38:02] Kisswani: I saw one dataminer say that Zereth Mortis is at least the size on Nazjatar if not bigger
[0:38:20] crashoverride_gaming: I can’t see how they could do that what so ever @magemaster225
[0:38:25] theDirtyon3: @Kisswani its huge we saw it on the WoWhead stream last night
[0:38:26] galdrelvolkfire: There's 5 islands around it too
[0:38:28] Zivs: i don't buy that rumor, someone could just have F12 inspect element edited that
[0:38:52] feherlofia123: ff14 proves mmos can be played on console. it would be good for the game
[0:38:57] Xaviwan078: wheres towellies
[0:39:02] SeckSymbols: Not to draw comparisons, but FF14 works well on consoles because it was designed with consoles in mind, and because of the GCD
[0:39:04] crashoverride_gaming: But a rumor is a rumor. Just like the phrase time is time
[0:39:04] theDirtyon3: Wowhead has a modeler that let him fly around the whole zone its bigger that Naz IMO
[0:39:06] Xaviwan078: towellie
[0:39:11] im_capy: last year the headlines were "World of Warcraft’s 2020 expansion won’t come to consoles anytime soon"
[0:39:14] Molvonos: There are mods that let you play WoW with a controller.
[0:39:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bigger than Nazjatar sounds good to me
[0:39:34] galdrelvolkfire: Not very many buttons
[0:39:42] im_capy: trying to play wow without addons LUL
[0:39:44] Gingerprimer: @Molvonos wow has contorller suport natively now
[0:39:48] feherlofia123: theres a ytube vid about someone playing wow on his phone
[0:40:30] galdrelvolkfire: y tho
[0:40:34] im_capy: there is a video of someone playing Skyrim on every device possible too
[0:40:45] crashoverride_gaming: I dunno, then you get into the whole “console players reaction time against a pc mouse player”

[0:40:46] SeckSymbols: WoW would have to do some crazy shit to make it work well on a controller imo
[0:40:58] SeckSymbols: @Collected1 Thats called a Nintendo Switch
[0:41:12] SwollenClam: theres a video of people making love on youtube
[0:41:19] feherlofia123: second best mmo i ever played was a mobile mmo called world of kings. it had the best m+ system ive witnessed in any game so far
[0:41:43] crashoverride_gaming: Sorry but IMO controller players don’t usually win over a mouse player. Again that is just my own opinion
[0:41:47] SeckSymbols: While I main FF14, I am just currently in the Riot MMO waiting room
[0:42:21] Xaviwan078: wheres towellie??
[0:42:32] feherlofia123: question is wheres ony
[0:42:41] theDirtyon3: everyone is in the riot MMO waiting room @SeckSymbols
[0:42:47] feherlofia123: what to do with my 170k points
[0:43:03] SeckSymbols: Do we think the Riot MMO will be sub based? Or buy to play? I see it as buy to play
[0:43:04] crixr6: some thing happened, I can sense it.
[0:43:16] feherlofia123: @secksymbols sub for sure
[0:43:30] Gingerprimer: 90% sure the RIOT mmo will be f2p
[0:43:33] Kisswani: if it has a ton of content to support it at launch , I would say go sub based
[0:43:35] Collected1: not banned

[0:44:07] JoeCocomo: Baby murloc a loc a loc
[0:44:15] BAS_Basvision: witchcraft
[0:44:17] Gingerprimer: RIOT has big enough of fanbase with their universe to be f2p and supported thourhg pure cosmetic mono
[0:44:20] Kisswani: @Collected1 damn , he doing hardcore stuff ?
[0:44:22] danimoto10: so what the PTR gave us?
[0:44:24] Collected1: yup
[0:44:25] cobrauskis: It's not a murloc in my pocket, I'm just happy to see you
[0:44:27] Collected1: level 50 HC death
[0:44:31] Kisswani: oof
[0:44:41] SeckSymbols: @Gingerprimer Thats kind of my thought on it, though I do think they would still want to sell the game at $40 as a buy in
[0:44:46] ShowDUH: @danimoto10 not up and we only basically saw all tier set
[0:44:48] Collected1: https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousSarcasticSangANELE-xBNoYntr8-J-BAFf
[0:44:49] Kisswani: AYAYA
[0:44:54] theDirtyon3: @SeckSymboboth make sense but riot will go with buy to play prob
[0:44:55] Dusk2090: lmao
[0:45:07] SeckSymbols: Riot doesnt need sub based money, they can make more money than most gaming companies do off of cosmetics alone
[0:45:29] Kisswani: oom

[0:46:20] PToastman: Looking fishy
[0:46:22] Jarlan23: imagine all the gifted subs he just lost dying there
[0:46:38] Gingerprimer: @SeckSymbols only other option I see is it being buy to play but with a super generous f2p version
[0:46:41] Jarlan23: the amount of subs he would've gotten from being world first with soul of iron on
[0:46:41] bicepsbrah: since when you play wow again? thought you wont play it anymore LUL
[0:47:04] Gingerprimer: @ziggywestgodx he just took a break from the game
[0:47:11] Molvonos: You mean like the 'proto denathrius' for all the fangirls?  All Denathrius, all the time.
[0:47:21] Rudric_Ice: reddit has some hilarious memes for dem tier sets LUL
[0:47:32] snipsfan: you can play whatever you wantnwhen you want
[0:47:35] bicepsbrah: @gingerprimer okay
[0:47:36] SeckSymbols: @Gingerprimer With how much good faith Riot has from all of their games, I could see it being outright F2P as well
[0:47:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Murloc!
[0:47:42] Kisswani: those proto models will haunt my nightmares forever
[0:47:42] Teecay: Haven't played since late 9.0. Is 9.2 worth coming back for?

[0:47:52] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[0:47:53] bicepsbrah: IT wasnt mean just wondering^^

[0:47:58] maccaruso: What bugs did they find in New World now?!?
[0:48:10] zardistus: not guilty on all counts
[0:48:11] Zivs: @Teecay that question is always impossible to answer without context
[0:48:21] theDirtyon3: LUL
[0:48:23] Atem___: I saw a commerical for it during Pats Falcons last night and I was like ooooooo towOof
[0:48:26] NeoGP: @Towelliee Didi you see the crooked "repair all" button?
[0:48:28] Gingerprimer: @SeckSymbols yeah also better for their enourmous asian market also avoids lots of comparisons with ffxiv/wow
[0:48:41] FergusCreative: Good trhing I requested a refund
[0:48:41] SilkeySmooth: rip new world
[0:48:42] BruisedApple: I honestly think they are tryin to kill the game.
[0:48:44] NewWorldReign: is it true that they finally updated the cheetah travel form?
[0:48:44] bicepsbrah: @maccaruso they nerfed elite farm chests elite hp buffed etc.... that why ibquit today after 600h
[0:48:45] duhworks: better drop more loot per kill then
[0:48:48] BruisedApple: They made their money
[0:48:48] SeckSymbols: @Gingerprimer Itll be bigger than WoW and FF14, I can see that happen easily
[0:48:49] Teecay: @Teecay I understand. I like M+ but all the grinds/currencies felt overwhelming. Are those more streamlined now?
[0:48:57] Zivs: @NewWorldReign believe so

[0:50:19] Gingerprimer: @Teecay yes esp for 9.2 there is only basically only 2 things with a new currency for leggos simiilar to nyalotha currency and a prob semi rep thing

[0:53:15] Gingerprimer: @sphjk why you the beta when it is out?
[0:53:15] crashoverride_gaming: Run around in the 9.2lock helm turns into the start of walking into the city as a dk everyday?
[0:53:19] xirangeix: I like "asian" style but ff14 is just so meh
[0:53:20] SeckSymbols: @xirangeix Whats wrong with the 14 combat?
[0:53:29] travrevyendk: i can finally express myself in 9.2 with the lock set
[0:53:32] xirangeix: the GCD triggers me and its just kinda meh
[0:53:42] xirangeix: OSRS combat feels more satisfying to me for some reason
[0:53:45] SeckSymbols: If you get triggered that easily then holy shit
[0:53:47] crixr6: Entertained by the baby Murlock.
[0:53:55] xirangeix: I mean WoW combnnats better, archeagem ect
[0:53:56] xirangeix: for tab target
[0:53:59] Rudric_Ice: you got the new transmog set ?

[0:54:08] Kisswani: yeah honestly I wasn't expecting you to stream today LUL
[0:54:18] SeckSymbols: @ziggywestgodx The reason we are calling you out is because you said something dumb
[0:54:22] Montius23: @momofantv can you ff14 weeb pls leave me alone? Ty i wont play IT even you try
[0:54:54] SeckSymbols: Probably
[0:54:58] Clicklesly: Wouldn't he be Kyrian biased? Kappa
[0:54:59] duhworks: we lose he loses
[0:55:01] SeckSymbols: I think the Jailer should win honestly
[0:55:04] Vivelli: temp till raid story happens?
[0:55:05] Kisswani: They will probably use the new sigils to forge the arbiter sigil again
[0:55:12] Rudric_Ice: lets face it Jailer's gonna die
[0:55:13] bicepsbrah: @secksymbols doesnt see wrong things but iam fine with your opinion
[0:55:13] Kisswani: kinda like they did after Zovaal
[0:55:16] Hyelander_: Assistant TO THE Arbiter
[0:55:17] LawrenceDreamer: no, before we fight the jailer
[0:55:25] SilkeySmooth: let the jailor win
[0:55:34] SeckSymbols: @ziggywestgodx Nothing I said was wrong
[0:55:39] Kisswani: we dont really know to be fair
[0:55:48] TynGuy: that's a office meme
[0:55:52] Rudric_Ice: its has been like that in every raids the "last boss dies"
[0:56:01] Rudric_Ice: xcept jaina
[0:56:04] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @Towelliee What are the odds of the new patch falling on the same day as SWTORs Expac lol...?
[0:56:10] Tooyoo: "Assistant TO THE arbiter" instead of "Assistant Arbiter"
[0:56:20] Calphurnious: So what did the jailor even do, I tried reading up on lore but they were very vague and didn't explain anything. for all i know he could've been good
[0:56:25] Kisswani: I guess
[0:56:26] SeckSymbols: Looks like UP for sure
[0:56:33] maccaruso: You are crazy but you are also correct
[0:56:40] SeckSymbols: March at the earliest
[0:56:43] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: YAY!!!
[0:56:53] Kisswani: are his abilities different ?
[0:56:54] theDirtyon3: i thought that fight was dope
[0:57:25] SeckSymbols: Anduin copies a lot of Lich King abilities which makes sense to a point, Xymox copies abilities, denathrius abilities coming back
[0:57:26] Rudric_Ice: which one ?
[0:57:28] UltiCarnagee: Wait are they actually recycling the same exact fight from an earlier raid? KEKW
[0:57:31] crashoverride_gaming: Ugh that damn fight was a pain
[0:57:37] SeckSymbols: I dont like them recycling a bunch of abilities like that
[0:57:53] Atem___: back for the phat loots
[0:57:56] Hybridwarhawk: Hybridwarhawk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! 
[0:58:04] Rudric_Ice: recycled raid boss KEKW
[0:58:06] Kisswani: it's to drive home the Arthas comparisons I guess
[0:58:06] SeckSymbols: Its lazy
[0:58:07] crashoverride_gaming: Noooooooo
[0:58:13] crashoverride_gaming: Oh come oooon
[0:58:33] Gingerprimer: Big fan of bringing back old abilites if they fit the story and theme of the fights
[0:58:39] Kisswani: yeah going into Kingsmourne
[0:58:41] Banglebye: anduin doesng defile
[0:58:54] Banglebye: its the jailer
[0:58:57] Rudric_Ice: i thought arfas was gonna be the arbiter Kappa
[0:59:12] hikaritd: Arthas' soul will "come out" from the sword in the fight 100% sure
[0:59:15] UltiCarnagee: So the rumors are next expac is going to be Cata 2.0? Azeroth undergoes some sort of Sundering or transformation?
[0:59:16] Hyelander_: Its on a sticky note
[0:59:16] Kisswani: like Argus I guess
[0:59:16] Vch001: "On the water" Kappa
[0:59:18] Im_a_sad_man: same as nazjatar
[0:59:26] SeckSymbols: @hikaritd Arthas taking place of Arthas's dad in the fight
[0:59:30] Alepouditsa: so if i don't help aduin can we let the jailor win
[0:59:30] Kisswani: oh and Nazjatar too
[0:59:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess a teleport to the new zone from Oribos
[0:59:43] ShleppyGaming: @towelliee can you post a link for your updated WOW UI please?
[0:59:43] crashoverride_gaming: So the end of of Anduin does his dad come down too? *sarcasm*
[0:59:43] Ortinoth: several floors it seems @Towelliee  as well
[0:59:45] luckfore: its huge, i saw run thorugh i t with a sandbox
[0:59:48] Molvonos: AQ40 levels of big?
[0:59:54] Kisswani: that's Zereth Mortis
[0:59:57] luckfore: yea thats the zone
[1:00:01] SeckSymbols: @crashoverride_gaming Honestly, they should do that. Not even joking. We havent seen Varian at all
[1:00:07] Rudric_Ice: doesn't look too "big" of a zone tho
[1:00:08] Kisswani: @Towelliee apparently it's at lesat the size of Nazjatar
[1:00:09] UltiCarnagee: Magic Water Pog
[1:00:12] SeckSymbols: Never before seen water
[1:00:14] Brutalny: slamming jungle juice buying wow skins
[1:00:24] SSD511_: Interesting
[1:00:32] crashoverride_gaming: @secksymbols I wouldn’t be surprised lol
[1:00:33] Gingerprimer: @SeckSymbols pretty sure they confirmed that Varian is not in SL since his soul was destoryed by fell magic
[1:00:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Big is good
[1:00:46] SeckSymbols: @Gingerprimer I guess that would make sense
[1:00:54] Dusk2090: water Pog
[1:01:06] Zivs: can just check the map in-game
[1:01:09] Kisswani: dataminers could
[1:01:15] SeckSymbols: Biggest isnt always better, I'd rather something be content rich than big for the sake of being big
[1:01:33] NewWorldReign: I guess Sylvanas is no use in SL from now on.
[1:01:38] Rudric_Ice: nazjatar was supposed to be much bigger but they cut it by half
[1:01:39] Tigerklaue: right side is the raid
[1:01:53] Sphafer: The rightside island is the raid
[1:01:58] Gingerprimer: @NewWorldReign she is in the raid as a npc
[1:02:00] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[1:02:08] Kisswani: you can fly in that zone tho . not sure a teleporter would be needed
[1:02:32] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani if its anything like Shadowlands base zones, zone is too far spread out to just fly there
[1:02:40] Kisswani: could be yeah
[1:02:53] luckfore: lol
[1:02:54] SeckSymbols: Korthia was a waste
[1:02:56] NewWorldReign: @Gingerprimer I know that yeah, but what purpose is she now other than a NPC?
[1:03:05] Rudric_Ice: korthia seems smalled than mechagon LUL
[1:03:09] Rudric_Ice: smaller*
[1:03:25] Gingerprimer: @NewWorldReign not sure guess we will have to learn in the story of the patch
[1:03:36] PvtHudson093: The new S3 M+ mount should have been the S1 M+ mount to match the Prideful affix
[1:03:38] SeckSymbols: Right side
[1:03:40] theDirtyon3: @Towelliee they went through the map without NPC's on Wowhead last night its huge
[1:03:46] travrevyendk: i just want the warlock set so i can do some RP lol
[1:04:03] Rudric_Ice: argus music monkaS
[1:04:07] theDirtyon3: @travrevyendk bruh....
[1:04:09] NewWorldReign: Theres one thing that baffles me, is Sylvanas still a Banshee or is she back to a living mortal now that the Jailer put her soul back?
[1:04:09] SeckSymbols: @travrevyendk What kind of RP are you planning...
[1:04:24] theDirtyon3: @SeckSymbols oh we both know what hes talking about
[1:04:29] Kisswani: proto types
[1:04:36] theDirtyon3: fucking yikes
[1:04:39] Gingerprimer: wow EDGY comment very cool fun with racism
[1:04:41] shimwood: That cape looks dope
[1:04:49] Firedexx: why am I seeing commercials if I been subbed for 103 months?
[1:04:52] travrevyendk: lets just say im very happy about the new skin colors/options they added with SL
[1:05:01] SeckSymbols: @travrevyendk That doesnt fix your comment
[1:05:11] travrevyendk: perfect for rping with warlock set haha
[1:05:12] Zivs: @Firedexx twitch being twitch
[1:05:13] Carryout: It looks like Oshugun in Nagrand @Towelliee
[1:05:15] theDirtyon3: @travrevyendk dont be a shit person
[1:05:16] Rudric_Ice: PROTO World of Warcraft
[1:05:28] Vivelli: KEKW
[1:05:34] travrevyendk: what? i just like rping
[1:05:34] SeckSymbols: Travrevyendk being outright racist in the chat...bruh
[1:05:43] travrevyendk: WTF? im a rper??
[1:05:45] Gingerprimer: Feels like that guys needs a timeout
[1:05:58] SeckSymbols: You're wnating to RP as a warlock, based of the set which looks very klanish

[1:06:26] Kisswani: maybe in the cinematic to make ppl go crazy
[1:06:38] PvtHudson093: Arthas Mythic only phase.....
[1:07:02] luckfore: man i wonder what the end cinematic will be
[1:07:05] luckfore: could be anything
[1:07:10] SeckSymbols: I think Anduin having a mythic only phase as a non end boss would be a nice twist
[1:07:12] GFiTV: maybe if u actually read through the post, u'd know what they're saying Kappa love u towel, stay u <3
[1:07:15] Clicklesly: There's a "new" KSM mount on Wowhead now too ^^
[1:07:21] KizaruGR: The Sepulchre must be purged
[1:07:24] Malkyr: Just think the patch that got scrapped could have been a chance to do a cool story revolving around Arthas but now he will just be a cutscene in a fight.
[1:07:37] Gingerprimer: They have also said they do not like mythic only phases that has big story elements in them
[1:07:42] Taz_85: That consular model is pretty funny. Just slapped some maw looking armor on Algalon, basically
[1:07:52] Kisswani: that intermission is probably the thing I want to see the most
[1:07:52] PvtHudson093: the new S3 M+ mount should have been the S1 M+ mount to match the pridefull affix
[1:07:54] Rudric_Ice: if azeroth is born then we die right ?
[1:08:01] NewWorldReign: "No king rules forever" What Arthas own father told him before he died, so maybe Arthas does it in a similar way
[1:08:07] FergusCreative: I wonder if they didnt do a 9.2 because 10.0 is going to be like cataclysm sized revamp but done right
[1:08:12] Clicklesly: @PvtHudson093 Yeah, that confused me too ^^
[1:08:15] sifer007: the end of Bobby KEKW
[1:08:24] FergusCreative: 9.3*
[1:08:29] luckfore: its pretty obvious his soul is in the blade, half of Anduins abilities are Lich King related
[1:08:34] GFiTV: @FergusCreative they HAVE TO do this. if they don't, scrapping shadowlands early was for nothing.
[1:08:35] akia03: did they say on what pieces the new lego bit can go on?
[1:08:37] miriones: this expansion story wise is so underwhelming
[1:08:44] crashoverride_gaming: towBolvar
[1:08:51] Kisswani: oh that's actually something , the re-judging of all the souls sent to the maw directly
[1:08:57] maccaruso: Pelagos is the new Bran Stark, confirmed?
[1:09:04] Malkyr: That is totally fair, I wish they would get away from the big named characters.
[1:09:15] espenenenen: hope he gets another expansion dedicated to him :D
[1:09:19] chickdrummer88: Good mornin Towelliee and chat towKawaii
[1:09:25] Atem___: I would rather post fight you and Uther track down his soul to bring him before the Arbiter so he gets his proper fate
[1:09:27] GFiTV: @Maccaruso atleast bran had a good storyline until he reached the tree XD
[1:09:27] Kisswani: Saurfang for example
[1:09:36] Ohdies: They have to do something since he was so important to the uther story
[1:09:46] Teldrin89: srsly, they will go full season 8 GoT? xd
[1:09:49] Molvonos: chickdSticks
[1:09:52] Rudric_Ice: Why no deathwing in shadowlands bruh
[1:09:55] Kromede: chickdrummer88 towHi towLove
[1:09:59] MysticRaven_: Why is pelagos considered the new arbiter what did i miss?
[1:10:04] crashoverride_gaming: The “beetle juice waiting room” classssiicccc!!
[1:10:05] Taz_85: That'd be a cool idea
[1:10:16] chickdrummer88: @molvonos chickdCreep
[1:10:18] Gingerprimer: @MysticRaven_ datamined stuff
[1:10:27] Elizare: @chickdrummer88 momcubStabby hai
[1:10:30] Atem___: I think he made it before
[1:10:31] chickdrummer88: @kromede chickdHi
[1:10:34] BrotherBeezy: And Klaia just yelling “next”!
[1:10:44] SnoWeazel: Nah, green dragon died after that
[1:10:46] Malkyr: Wasnt Tyrions soul totally obliterated by the Legion?
[1:10:46] chickdrummer88: @elizare teenLEAVE
[1:10:46] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:10:47] Atem___: anyone who died before Ysera should be fine
[1:10:48] SnoWeazel: ysera
[1:10:51] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee I do not think He is the maw due to him getting destoryed by fell
[1:11:15] Atem___: Ardenwield said Ysera was one of the last souls to make it
[1:11:29] Taz_85: Was Tirion supposed to be one of those souls in that Torghast wing for the Uther story?
[1:11:29] Light2512: @Towelliee   so Pelagos be the new Arbiter for Shadowlands?
[1:11:31] Ohdies: Arthas didn’t end up in the maw the same way as everyone else
[1:11:37] luckfore: im never going back to the "old" Shadowlands zones when 9.2 comes out. So done with them
[1:11:38] Rudric_Ice: why would he help us tho ?
[1:11:42] Tooyoo: I don't know how we get back to things on azeroth mattering anymore ,after KNOWING the afterlife exists.
[1:11:43] crashoverride_gaming: Nazoth twist would be a very interesting twist
[1:12:19] Gingerprimer: They want the power of the planet not have the power destoryed
[1:12:19] NewWorldReign: But were does the Void work in all this?

[1:12:27] xhale2nhale: I mean Nzoth is like the trickster/smartest one of the Old Gods so I can see him helping but at the same time scheming
[1:12:32] SeckSymbols: @NewWorldReign The void was a myth
[1:12:44] Runetailx: And yet they had Yogg-Saron
[1:12:49] miriones: if the old gods can die then they are not gods
[1:12:58] crashoverride_gaming: Haha or I’ll is an just coming down and yelling “I told you…you are not prepared!!!” And end scene
[1:12:59] Rudric_Ice: maybe he can help us but for his own benefits or something
[1:13:10] crashoverride_gaming: Illidan*
[1:13:14] Malkyr: Now Im picturing a giant TShirt cannon shooting tentacle monsters into space
[1:13:16] Taz_85: The last big bad we know of are the Void Lords, right? And they'd be even higher up than the Jailer
[1:13:17] Kisswani: what's your renown at ?
[1:13:21] NewWorldReign: we all thought the titans were dead but we saved them in antorus.
[1:13:24] Taz_85: Until new villains are established, that is
[1:13:43] SeckSymbols: Illidan coming in would be forced
[1:13:46] SeckSymbols: Sargeras would be forced
[1:13:56] Kisswani: It is the best part , but sometimes we set our selves up for disappointment
[1:14:09] crashoverride_gaming: That red lights there for a reason IMO
[1:14:10] iblighters: I mean all truths
[1:14:19] Rudric_Ice: why baine doesn't do anything etc
[1:14:21] CushyPop: It's a bold move
[1:14:21] xhale2nhale: sometimes if you get to into the story it'll drive you mental
[1:14:26] SeckSymbols: I also feel the ending bit is forced
[1:14:35] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee I still think that the worlds souls are the real titans and the pantheon were just created as placeholders while they sleep/gather power
[1:14:37] Alepouditsa: the only guy i care about was my king but the kill him BibleThump
[1:14:47] Hyelander_: We need Gamon to be the savior of Azeroth
[1:14:50] Kromede: oopsie
[1:14:56] NewWorldReign: Cant Chrome do something about, it, because of her power to control time?
[1:15:17] danimoto10: yep for sure, they just didnt know what the fuck to say lol
[1:15:22] Kisswani: regardless of what they decide to do , 5 minutes later a thread on reddit calling it " lazy writing " will be upvoted to infinity
[1:15:37] Hyelander_: During las phase, Jailer accidentally cleaves GAMON and gets killed by enraged Gamon
[1:15:40] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani Well..would you blame them?
[1:15:51] xhale2nhale: yea they need to start being vocal when it comes to how many patches they want in a xpac
[1:15:56] miktzo: nzoth did nothing wrong
[1:16:03] Kisswani: @SeckSymbols yeah I would , because it doesn't actually matter what the ending is
[1:16:21] Vch001: "The entire World of Warcraft Saga was just part 1 of the story Chomi to telling to your character's children before bed"
[1:16:27] Kisswani: @SeckSymbols I mean that people will bitch about it regardless
[1:16:28] PvtHudson093: Chromie turns up wearing bronze tinted glasses and says we need to go back the future
[1:16:32] Kromede: /dance
[1:16:43] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani To me, them coming out and saying its the ending of part 1, means they are being lazy and pulling the ripcord as everyone would call it on the bullshit story Warcraft has become

[1:17:17] xhale2nhale: I can see a whole continent of dragons being a thing, either dragon isle or light vs void next xpac
[1:17:17] SeckSymbols: @Kisswani Instead of taking the time to fix it, or come up with something good, we are getting a sudden and abrupt ending
[1:17:28] FleuryGG: Chromie about to come in like I Dream Of Genie BOINGGG Kappa
[1:17:31] CraftyKraken: what keeps you coming back to WoW?
[1:17:35] Gingerprimer: Yeah and only having 1 real content patch for a whole year can not be on schedule
[1:17:49] Jarlan23: how many months was the drought in wod
[1:18:08] Kisswani: would it be as good if it doesn't count on spell blocks ?
[1:18:53] Gingerprimer: Yeah a decent chunk of the tier sets looks really cool
[1:18:57] Brutalny: they got to change it up to get new players
[1:19:11] Scavosky: could also pair the 4 set with the juggment lego if it worked like that
[1:19:17] crashoverride_gaming: I just hope blizzard does understand the ending of this expansion really needs to end well. Like don’t let this all have been for a shit ending
[1:19:33] Atem___: last patch of expansion, time for classes to wild and have fun
[1:19:44] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee do you think we get crossfaction stuff in 10.0?
[1:19:47] theDirtyon3: the end of xpac drought should be short though to be fair
[1:19:50] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[1:20:05] SeckSymbols: With how behind they are, I dont expect 10.0 until Early 2023
[1:20:11] andrewexiled: wod drought was june 15 to aug 16 when legion launched
[1:20:15] SeckSymbols: Which will be an insane end of expansion drought
[1:20:27] theDirtyon3: itll be close
[1:20:33] peinen: I could see another Oct-Nov 10.0
[1:20:33] Crocfacex: hows season of mastery going
[1:20:41] Brutalny: it is going to take them time, didn't they clean house
[1:20:44] Malkyr: Eh if this expac has a shit ending and 10.0 is awesome it will be fine, we will all just put Shadowlands done as the worst expac for WoW forever
[1:20:51] PvtHudson093: feb/march
[1:20:52] Rygothx: just play the last patch of the expansion, when all issues and bs at start are fixed 👌
[1:21:02] EbonLou: Oh you mean within the next 365 days and not before the end of 2021

[1:21:06] FergusCreative: what if expac was announced with ingame cinematic
[1:21:08] xhale2nhale: I think when they get everything fix at Blizz I get the feeling the gonna have some fun with the next xpac
[1:21:10] danimoto10: you will be playing the alpha as usual? @Towelliee
[1:21:13] Scavosky: @Towelliee could also pair the 4 set with the juggment lego if it worked like that

[1:21:36] SeckSymbols: PTR should go away as well
[1:21:38] xendros78: and FF14 6.1 should come out in March
[1:21:40] chickdrummer88: 2 weeks
[1:21:54] andrewexiled: i always wonder how they managed to get cata out so soon considering how much work they did remaking azeroth plus new zones. Must of crunched like hell.
[1:22:06] cardinalism: Thoughts on SoM toweliee?
[1:22:07] xhale2nhale: ^^
[1:22:15] SeckSymbols: People hate on Cata a lot but Cata was fucking poggers
[1:22:36] cardinalism: cata was actually a nice expansion
[1:22:37] assman_ny: Morning/afternoon chat.
[1:22:46] Rudric_Ice: you don't like classic period LUL
[1:22:47] Vivelli: releasing q1 next year also looks good on the books
[1:22:48] xhale2nhale: TBH I enjoyed the mini war in cata zones in the barrens
[1:22:51] assman_ny: I did not mind Cata
[1:22:51] xendros78: I enjoyed the leveling zones in Cata a lot

[1:23:41] akia03: murloc is acending
[1:23:43] SeckSymbols: But yeah, Blizzard releasing PTR on week of Endwalker is typical Blizzard, but I dont think they truly understand the pull that Endwalker is having
[1:23:46] Kisswani: @Towelliee did you notice the murloc going into the egg shell when you enter combat ?
[1:23:59] kronnnotv: Hey, I came back yesterday to retail after a 2 year break of the game, whats the best leveling method from 10 to 50 ?
[1:24:06] MysticRaven_: i live seeing the murloc hide in the egg
[1:24:10] Sir_Onionknight: I wonder when I'm gonna get my murloc since I'm on a 6 month sub lol
[1:24:17] luckfore: LUL
[1:24:21] Zivs: @SeckSymbols ok but when are they gonna release it otherwise? I don't think it has anything to do with ff honestly
[1:24:23] SeckSymbols: @Sir_Onionknight You think Blizzard will compensate you LUL
[1:24:25] ItsGlime: Kappa
[1:24:28] Reckless_Monk: mucloc saved christmas
[1:24:32] Brutalny: bruh, i just tried the new world patch.  I can't believe they done this, progression is so bad not even worth anymore
[1:24:33] Gingerprimer: @TheKronnoLad if you are solo playing dungeon spamming/questing
[1:24:34] crashoverride_gaming: So what exactly is the cena addon used for?

[1:26:02] Gingerprimer: New toment zone in the maw going around and healing the woudns
[1:26:03] Rudric_Ice: next expansion we fight against Yrel and Turalyon
[1:26:04] SeckSymbols: @Zivs If you don't think that this wasn't all planned out, then I don't know what to tell you
[1:26:42] RhadigarTV: It would be suicide to do that
[1:26:44] xhale2nhale: @Rudi_Ice would be cool
[1:26:46] Reckless_Monk: the real question is if you kissed the homies goodnight towelliee? @Towelliee

[1:27:43] Erielle04: Unless they have everything ready for testing on day 1, I doubt it
[1:27:51] Rudric_Ice: savage is like mythic difficulty ?
[1:27:54] SeckSymbols: Raid comes out 2 weeks later, Savage 2 weeks after that
[1:28:27] SeckSymbols: Max is trying to find someone to do all the crafting, dont know if he ever found someone
[1:28:32] MisterSpoooky: How is the current PvP state in retail?
[1:28:49] Kisswani: The WF static is probably gonna stream the Savage raids as well . so it might be a new era for FF raiding
[1:29:03] luckfore: KSM Season 3 mount on wowhead, same model diff color
[1:29:09] Kisswani: would be fun to see how people would react to a race that lasts a day or 2
[1:29:17] Rygothx: Imagine if WoW doesn't have talent trees, prob eaiser to balance stuff like ff14
[1:29:18] theDirtyon3: you can buy 40 yeah
[1:29:34] crashoverride_gaming: Serious question though so other than the covenant stuff there isn’t really a lot going down in wow till 9.2?
[1:29:35] SeckSymbols: @rygothx You're absolutely right
[1:30:04] Gingerprimer: @crashoverride_gaming correct in retail
[1:30:16] Kisswani: no AP grind will do that to you
[1:30:19] theDirtyon3: i miss doing legion WQ

[1:32:32] crashoverride_gaming: @gingerprimer so people now I assume are just focusing on mythic raiding at this point? I haven’t played in a minute
[1:32:33] Vivelli: do you think you will go back to mythic in 9.2?
[1:32:48] theDirtyon3: Raiding this xpac has been very tedious
[1:32:53] Vivelli: oh not till 10. damn
[1:32:53] Rudric_Ice: they should have given the game for free in black friday sale
[1:32:55] Gingerprimer: @crashoverride_gaming yes or whatever you have
[1:33:01] xendros78: join the plebe side
[1:33:02] PvtHudson093: You did say that SL could go either way all the way back in Beta
[1:33:08] crashoverride_gaming: Ayyyeeee
[1:33:13] Gingerprimer: @crashoverride_gaming or whatever you like collecting/m+/pvp or stuff

[1:33:42] SeckSymbols: What tank are you going to go? Is sloot gonna be the pally or you?
[1:34:00] officialcristi: @towelliee I wait you in FFXIV
[1:34:01] PvtHudson093: SL WQ's are just not fun
[1:34:40] m3rk_zion: So you've basically went from mythic raider to casual raider.
[1:34:42] Rudric_Ice: Cancel vegas Kappa
[1:34:48] Sir_Onionknight: I'm pretty sure my WoW guild is dead and I'm not sure if I'm going to run raids in FFXIV since I don't know what job I'm going to play lol
[1:35:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol one does not simply cancel Vegas
[1:35:10] xendros78: ask yoship to push back savage to the 11th LUL
[1:35:11] crashoverride_gaming: @gingerprimer thank you for the info. I think my shield will stay on the mantle WoW wise till 9.2. I just hope I don’t have to do serious catch up but 🤷🏻♂️
[1:35:20] officialcristi: @sir_onionknight for DPS recoment you Samurai

[1:37:08] Vch001: When you get back and find out your friends have all race changed to lallafels
[1:37:18] SeckSymbols: Depending on how fast you go, You could be close to done with Endwalker story by the time early access ends
[1:37:25] Gingerprimer: @crashoverride_gaming yeah from what I gather the only catchup you have to do coming into 9.2 is getting to 80 renown. Even if in december we will get 2 weeks of Legin m+ timewalking with magetower
[1:37:54] xendros78: @SeckSymbols yep, I'd expect 4 or 5 days to play through the story and watch all the cutscenes and read dialogue
[1:38:02] crashoverride_gaming: Oh that’s right you are a lallafel!!
[1:38:06] Bl4ckSauce: jaysW
[1:38:21] SeckSymbols: If it were 12 hour days of pure story, no Rich patented stalling, that would be about 5 days roughly to finish

[1:42:56] SeckSymbols: If anything, I will watch other people start the story but never past what I have done
[1:43:05] m3rk_zion: These WQ's always gave me super bad anxiety lol so I just never did them XD

[1:45:54] xluckydawgx: God i cant wait for the first raid tier
[1:46:07] xendros78: nope, normal raid launches on dec 21st
[1:46:16] Rudric_Ice: you get flying at renown 40 yes ?
[1:46:18] MysticRaven_: if you could have addons like elvui in Swotor i would play more
[1:46:27] Vivelli: do you think rwf for FF will happen with this expac?
[1:46:34] Vivelli: for twitch events i mean
[1:47:22] xluckydawgx: RWF for ultimate in 6.1? Yeah probably, savage? probably not
[1:47:24] SeckSymbols: For savage raids yes, Ultimates are longer
[1:47:33] Malkyr: They tried to do a race for World First in Shadowbringer, no one really watched it
[1:47:37] SeckSymbols: TPS

[1:47:56] chowzter: Sfia that did the whole thing with max
[1:48:07] xluckydawgx: and its less FC and more Statics, you dont have to be in the same FC to raid
[1:48:21] Noshpan: Sfia's or maybe Blue Garter?
[1:48:42] Malkyr: Yeah in FF community you dont really raid with guildies, you form a group on Discords.
[1:49:05] StreamElements: Use code TOWEL14 to get up to 14 FREE MEALS across your first 5 HelloFresh boxes, including free shipping on your first box at https://strms.net/TowelHelloFreshBot #ad

[1:50:17] chowzter: FFXIV have used "linkshells" forever to form raidgrps
[1:50:17] xluckydawgx: Guilds in FF are more for social interaction
[1:50:25] Noshpan: I remember in early Shadowbringers, Sfia was receiving death threats & accusations of cheating when his group beat the Japanese FCs in world first raids.
[1:50:43] Malkyr: I mean I know 3 of my guildies that have a static with people from 3 other guilds. There are Discords devoted to clearing Savages and Ultimates

[1:53:09] luckyydo: hey guys how's the new patch? curious if its worth coming back too I've been gone about 8 months.
[1:53:43] Vivelli: yep
[1:53:50] Exxcar: well Legion timewalking KEKW
[1:54:14] SeckSymbols: Endwalker is the biggest MMO release in recent memory. People can throw sales numbers around all they want, but Endwalker is just different
[1:54:40] nihkko_: dont come back
[1:55:15] Sly_404: @luckyydo don't, wait bare minimum till 9.2 so you dont have to do catch up
[1:55:18] luckyydo: @nikk0laz not much change?
[1:55:26] luckyydo: thanks guys
[1:55:34] drunken_panda86: im trying to find a nice good mmo and stick with it. but ffs its so hard....i really dunno what to choose and stick with it. casual player here since i cant dedicate that much time....if u guys have an advice im all ears...
[1:55:43] luckyydo: how you been Toweliee?
[1:55:45] Sly_404: @luckyydo its foremost QoL changes but little new content
[1:55:50] Malkyr: Perfect analogy yeah
[1:56:10] Rudric_Ice: i just want New world to be good not a FF fan
[1:56:30] luckyydo: wait whats endwalker?
[1:56:37] Sly_404: thats not happening anytime soon @Rudi_Ice LUL
[1:56:40] Malkyr: Id love to see them be brave and somehow scrap everything and start a new story (without 1000 hours of MSQ to go through for new players) with the next expac. Not sure how youd do it
[1:56:48] Zoidmire: As a Boomkin, how do you feel about all the new badass druid forms?
[1:56:48] Brutalny: new world is a meme game for real
[1:56:54] luckyydo: oh  FF ignore me lol
[1:57:02] hanbrolo5: big yikes
[1:57:13] Brutalny: they managed to screw over casual players like myself and end game players without even putting it in the patch notes
[1:57:36] Brutalny: the void weapons break pvp
[1:57:40] Vivelli: new world was so hyped, i was so excited, but damn man what a fall
[1:57:49] Sly_404: there was that twitter post of a NW dev that made it clear that management made boneheaded decisions asking them to use a engine that was not made for mmos in the first place
[1:57:49] Buttscratchrr: whats up everyone
[1:57:55] luckyydo: i couldn't get past level 40 in NW the leveling was awful for me
[1:58:23] Rudric_Ice: feels like amazon wants to kill their mmo
[1:58:29] xmedpakx: i hit 46 and just had no interest
[1:58:33] Cryptunlol: HAMMER OF F**** YOUR FACE
[1:58:39] xmedpakx: sadly boring for me
[1:58:46] Athinzi: New World needs some work for sure.
[1:58:53] Brutalny: if they revert it to release, and just fix the duping and other exploits that is the way to go for new world
[1:58:57] Brutalny: the game is fun in that form
[1:58:57] nihkko_: too little content...wait until 9.2. Play FF14 in the meantime,such a good game
[1:59:14] Zivs: if it WAS current, then its now former KEKHeim
[1:59:16] Sly_404: sure give me a sec
[1:59:31] Towelliee: !permit theslickric
[1:59:32] Moobot: @Towelliee @TheSlickRic will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[1:59:37] JackedDown: Yeah it feels more like a regular open world game
[1:59:44] tebbix: I took a 3 month break on WoW, tried  FF and got to level 80 did Eden raids and it was very refreshing, now I'm enjoying WoW again lol and I bought Endwalker
[1:59:48] SeckSymbols: I've heard of that controversy. There were things going around that the game was more of a tech demo for the engine than an actual long term project
[2:00:24] Rudric_Ice: NW looks really good for a mmo ngl
[2:00:30] Brutalny: amazon don't play though, if a game developer team don't perform they just pull the plug
[2:00:32] chickdrummer88: @theslickric Go ahead and post the link
[2:00:53] SeckSymbols: @Brutalny Thats called bad management, instead of fixing the problem you just end it? Thats horrible
[2:00:57] HawtPepperTuna: believe in the heart of the cards
[2:01:02] Brutalny: Amazon had already pulled the plug on 3 other amazon games before they even released for poor performance from the teams
[2:01:36] Brutalny: they gave new world years to get it right, and they are not performing

[2:06:12] chickdrummer88: @secksymbols they have to care about their devs and the game to keep improving it with their fuck you money. Amazon's view will always be if it's causing issues and making them lose money, scrap it.

[3:40:41] robertjordan83: @Towelliee he says we still have to defeat the jailor, so he's not defeated by that point
[3:40:52] Demented7: Yo that mace look's filthy !
[3:40:53] theDirtyon3: its his dad KEKW
[3:41:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  arthas didnt become a king so it might be Varian
[3:41:24] dSaipher: It's Wrynn's Locket
[3:41:47] theDirtyon3: THICC

[3:42:25] blazyturtle: i don't give a cosmic fuck tbh
[3:42:30] jeffnsteff2019: cosmic poop what i call it
[3:42:42] theDirtyon3: its Wowhead
[3:42:54] theDirtyon3: they have an egnine that can run the map
[3:43:07] theDirtyon3: well Wowhead did it yesterday too
[3:43:26] theDirtyon3: The map is huge
[3:43:26] Exxcar: @theDirtyon3 not to this level though
[3:43:32] Exxcar: This is EVERYTHING
[3:43:38] Exxcar: Wowhead only loaded the tileset
[3:43:43] Ezekyler: looks like normal water to me
[3:43:57] Korupcija_: water Pog
[3:44:02] dawgystyle_13: you can "Walk" on it
[3:44:09] PlaguedV: Plot water PogChamp
[3:44:13] tylive52: this reminds me of Hayven games!
[3:44:27] cazhually: they should have a mini game of who gets over the water the quickest
[3:44:36] Korupcija_: not enough grey, 4/10
[3:44:45] theDirtyon3: its pretty big
[3:44:55] existenceisouroboros: Looks like an average wow zone to me.  Mediocre-ish
[3:44:59] Reklawtam: bye felicia
[3:45:03] cazhually: i mean its better than the dark korthia/maw stuff
[3:45:04] vic_ave: you get head in that glade
[3:45:07] nothumbgamer_ttv: must be pretty big for blizz to let you fly there
[3:45:08] theDirtyon3: wait til the desert
[3:45:12] Ezekyler: stil i don't get the vibe of the zone, Bastionn or Ardenweald feel more interesting to me
[3:45:15] cazhually: im getting the ewlynn forest vibes
[3:45:20] cazhually: lots of greenery
[3:45:28] Anachron10: im getting laziness vibes
[3:45:37] jamarky23: Looks pretty decent compared to korthia
[3:45:57] PSI0N: Kreygasm
[3:46:08] blazyturtle: its honestly not as cool as ardenweald but its def better than the maw/korthia, tired of all the grey doom look
[3:46:11] tr1ckshot22: Reskinned spheres, so hot right now
[3:46:12] jamarky23: Way cooler vibes aswell
[3:46:18] nothumbgamer_ttv: honestly, i get the vibe that its azeroth merged into 1 zone, as the first ones would have had to have a template for azeroth?
[3:46:29] Anachron10: garbage zone, but ill agree, it can't possibly be worse than korthia
[3:46:53] Melonbrew: Getting Guild wars 2 vibes. With the structures.
[3:46:54] mikejames01: @Anachron10 dude stop
[3:47:00] Avinar: when is the speculated release date of 9.2?
[3:47:15] Rottencoarse: march?
[3:47:26] Anachron10: sorry for being negative, thats how retail has left me after 8 months to wait for 9.1 and only get korthia. tkae care people
[3:47:29] Rottencoarse: since ptr just hit
[3:47:32] jamarky23: @Anachron10 I mean you seem like the guy that just wants to hate on wow no matter what even if they actually do release good content. go back to ff14 dude
[3:47:58] Avinar: Orobos beta
[3:48:03] mikejames01: I like the look of this new zone alot
[3:48:08] Korupcija_: are you gonna mythic raid again in 9.2 Towelliee?
[3:48:10] OceanManCarter: Looks like the Vindicaar
[3:48:12] IronPhalanX: Orbos on meth
[3:48:21] SnoWeazel: hex floor tiles remind me of devinity 2
[3:48:31] abruptdecayO_O: this is definitely a better zone than the maw/korthia so thats all that matters
[3:48:38] blazyturtle: ^
[3:48:42] Korupcija_: and nazjatar is huge
[3:48:44] jamarky23: Thats really good then
[3:48:52] Kedemel: is flying unlocked automatically here?
[3:48:52] Thagoris: Flexin dem guns!  Happy Friday.
[3:48:57] Kedemel: or is it ground mounts only?
[3:48:59] mikejames01: I loved nazjtar also lol
[3:49:05] Avinar: first and only true zone of the xpac? Kappa

[3:49:07] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Towelliee does originpc ship to the uk?
[3:49:28] asmo_daios: is this classic or retail
[3:49:36] stingraysam: gotta be retail eh
[3:49:57] jamarky23: What i like is that they learned from previous zones. Ardenweald looks great but there arent any landmarks or diversity in biomes its just a big patch of pretty trees
[3:50:04] asmo_daios: korthia area is so damn lagged out
[3:50:36] tylive52: hard carry by the art team again
[3:50:36] Korupcija_: wish they let us play with this during thanksgiving :(
[3:50:36] blazyturtle: ok this is actually pretty cool
[3:50:38] PSI0N: LUL
[3:50:45] The_Loony_Bin: I just hope there's no world boss to avoid all the server lag
[3:50:54] IronPhalanX: im digging this zone
[3:51:01] The_Loony_Bin: oh. nvm then
[3:51:03] The_Loony_Bin: lol
[3:51:11] crashoverride_gaming: I mean I love both WoW and FF14. I am just so so bored with WoW. I haven’t ever put up my shield in WoW till 9.1. I know I am a BC baby but that’s a long time to stick with a game and just be unsatisfied now…I hope 9.2 puts that pep back in my step for WoW
[3:51:43] jamarky23: And theres WATER, truly next gen water that you can walk on LUL
[3:51:44] asmo_daios: i quit 8 years of ffxiv for wow 5 months ago, enjoying wow a lot
[3:52:01] existenceisouroboros: But you can WALK on it Kappa
[3:52:08] officialviz: It's HUUUUUGE good god.
[3:52:09] ashcrow232: I play tbc wow and ff11 plus 14 no time for retail LUL
[3:52:16] Rygothx: @crashoverride_gaming same, hoping 9.2 is worth coming back to
[3:52:27] Up2Snuph: looks like the game of thrones intro ball thing
[3:52:28] Avinar: I think it's healthy to bounce between both games. Just enjoy what you want imo. I've played WoW since vanilla, and XIV since 1.0, bouncing between the two.
[3:52:49] MugiwarasNakama: Idk... this zone looks super boring for me lol
[3:52:50] Moobot: Check out all of the new changes for WoW Classic Season of Mastery at Wowhead! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/season-of-mastery-som-overview-wow-classic
[3:52:54] devaston: Forge of Afterlives aka Bobby's Office
[3:53:05] Oakengrove: Great Vauldt KEKW
[3:53:06] Avinar: I really hope they dont scuff out on the lore because it has a ton of potential.
[3:53:19] z01z: looks like bastion 2.0, and i hate that zone, makes my eyes hurt
[3:53:22] jamarky23: @Avinar There we go, actually normal people that just enjoy shit instead of going on a crusade on which mmo is the best
[3:53:24] assman_ny: I like that desert mix
[3:53:38] Miklagart: giga lore like 8.3
[3:53:42] chukudu: I have WIldstar feels with that zone
[3:53:50] MugiwarasNakama: this zone reminds me alot of Portal knights lol
[3:53:51] Korupcija_: I'm hyped
[3:54:05] VegaViscus: what is this art
[3:54:10] asmo_daios: wait this isnt in the game right now right?
[3:54:21] crashoverride_gaming: @rygothx just sad I put so much into WoW but I just started staring at my screen and just bored. I hope 9.2 brings me back cause I’ll be back. Just maybe the universe saying “try some other stuff right now” lol
[3:54:25] Miklagart: shit that looks sick
[3:54:25] Korupcija_: Sepepulrchar PogChamp
[3:54:28] officialviz: I like how the entrance is a jump platform, that's neat.
[3:54:33] abruptdecayO_O: @TolandVerse next patch
[3:54:33] jamarky23: Imagine if every SL zone  had this diversity
[3:54:40] Rygothx: Doesn't it feel bigger than Nazjhatar?
[3:54:40] asmo_daios: ahh nice thanks
[3:54:50] DuploThief: @towellie the remant of the fallen king in the anduin fight must be arthas becasue of the abilities it uses are dk abilities and it uses abilities from the lich king fight
[3:54:55] jeffnsteff2019: please tell devs throw world boss in a non cluster mob area
[3:55:04] VegaViscus: just me or the art on the textures look bland

[3:55:04] Ponzie: What video is this?
[3:55:15] mojusk: YEP
[3:55:26] Korupcija_: tweet at blizzard to move world boss
[3:55:28] Avinar: world boss now hidden behind a portal for a small room
[3:55:30] Ponzie: Is there a link to this video available?
[3:55:34] 5_0_trees: wonder why they cant fix that
[3:55:34] abruptdecayO_O: @Monkeeyo textures do seem alittle too smooth. i think its on purpose tho idk
[3:55:44] SuperSaiyanJones: why's it look like the art team went backwards in time with the quality of the landscape
[3:55:45] Partizangaming: ye this is like huge
[3:55:51] Rygothx: @crashoverride_gaming yeah just gotta try something else for now.  I left 8 months ago to play ff14. Just finished the story and a few raids that's all and stopped. Getting itchy with WoW again for sure.
[3:55:54] mojusk: world bosses should be instanced like on argus
[3:55:55] xxxwaxyxxx: its gunna be funny when players kite the world boss to town and kills everything haha
[3:56:01] asmo_daios: so this will take place after shadowlands, wonder how the story fits in
[3:56:02] Oakengrove: Hmm Kinda meh tbh. Feel like I've seen it before. This should be completely different and otherworldly. The unfinished emerald dream from vanilla looks more alien
[3:56:04] 5_0_trees: portals maybe again
[3:56:06] Thoreya: Like double the size of of shadowlands
[3:56:10] crashoverride_gaming: I just frown on the FF14 side of “then go back to WoW” and the WoW go back to FF14” I’ll go back to what ever I damn well please!lol
[3:56:22] Ortinoth: @TolandVerse this is the final chapter of shadowlands
[3:56:30] blazyturtle: if this is really the last patch and there's no 9.3 then the zone better be fucking HUGE and full of stuff to do
[3:56:41] officialviz: We can fly here right?
[3:56:43] asmo_daios: @Ortinoth alright, yeah looks good
[3:56:54] Kedemel: true. this patch is going to have to last us a long time.
[3:56:54] Ortinoth: @officialviz will be unlockable
[3:56:57] Wheeellz: @Oakengrove we get it...you're bored of wow
[3:56:58] officialviz: @officialviz rgr, ty
[3:57:18] blazyturtle: im honestly impressed, this video makes the zone look awesome
[3:57:19] Avinar: @crashoverride_gaming I don't think there's anything wrong with criticizing either game and wanting more out of it and enjoying more. I guess as long as it's done in a positive way and not just "lol dead game" kinda way, I don't mind.
[3:57:21] Kisswani: oh shit , that was the same symbol as the symbol on the Dark Portal , on the dread portal POGGERS
[3:57:38] h3artl3ss50: @Towelliee I havent played since last November. Anything you recommend for jumping back?
[3:57:41] Oakengrove: @Wheeellz I'm not really. I'm still playing. I honestly just think it looks meh
[3:57:59] Sielu11628: Def would have been cool to put a dungeon in this huge zone
[3:58:06] crashoverride_gaming: @rygothx but the bright side is man there are some pretty good games out there in my opinion that I am glad I have had the chance to play now
[3:58:14] trailerparkholly: Same bullshit if you ask me
[3:58:27] Kedemel: what do we use for addon management nowadays, boys?
[3:58:42] Carahail: wowup is good
[3:59:02] SuperSaiyanJones: it looks like the entire landscape was meant to be underwater
[3:59:03] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Won't they stop working soon?
[3:59:14] Peoplewhinetoomuch: wowup etc
[3:59:26] volkreig: I'm getting some AQ vibes oddly from some of the subzones
[3:59:33] Demented7: If this area isnt like sunwell or pandaria rich with lore / cont itll hurt my feelings atpFeelsBeardMan
[3:59:37] EggwithEdges: Sylvanas ofc
[3:59:41] tylive52: @Towelliee I wish WoW did more drops like every other game on the platform =(
[3:59:42] Oakengrove: Yeah, overwolf will break 3rd party updaters soon
[3:59:48] sinlesssinner: i dont think Blizzard knows who the first ones are :)
[3:59:51] Sarocus: Question is: What are they the first of?
[3:59:57] Wrongwaykid: looks like vex areas in destiny
[4:00:00] sinlesssinner: they are making it up as they go along
[4:00:01] crashoverride_gaming: @avinar I agree entirely if it is just positive and not stfu dead game game sucks” entitled to opinion but come on…
[4:00:10] 5_0_trees: another collect the shards mount
[4:00:40] Exxcar: @Towelliee what you mean this is the end of the chapter started all the way back in WC3 dcwLul
[4:00:51] crashoverride_gaming: Just irks me when I see it but again @avinar I do agree with you on that
[4:00:57] Kisswani: we need Khadgar and Medivh to show up in this zone somehow
[4:00:59] Oakengrove: No one heard of it? But it's a story that's been in the making since W3 OMEGALUL
[4:01:03] asmo_daios: more places to use heroic leap
[4:01:04] MugiwarasNakama: The art style in this zone does not feel like warcraft imho
[4:01:04] baron_savage: So are we going back to Azeroth after this?
[4:01:36] Avinar: @crashoverride_gaming A lot of people that are huge fans can't handle any form of criticism since they often can't imagine putting time into something else. Sorta feels like it invalidates their effort on a subconscious, level I believe. It's often why a lot of people don't voice their opinions since people will often hate on it if they don't agree lol.
[4:01:39] killswiitch: meh
[4:01:41] Ezekyler: hexagons, an impossible geometry on Azeroth! towPog
[4:01:46] officialviz: Can I get the link to this video? Some on my buddies in my discord are asking to watch.
[4:01:56] ashcrow232: Ulduar
[4:02:01] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:02:08] Oakengrove: Ohhh that's that good NEW water right there!
[4:02:11] DegenerateHaven: dont compare any content of shadowlands to ulduar, thank you
[4:02:11] Avinar: soon tm
[4:02:15] 5_0_trees: def. reminds me for argus
[4:02:18] Kisswani: @Ezekyler danBlank
[4:02:20] blazyturtle: oh shit
[4:02:22] The_Loony_Bin: I'm confused as to what's a titan and how they differ from the first ones
[4:02:26] crashoverride_gaming: @avinar I couldn’t agree with you more! Like you hit the nail on the head on that one
[4:02:26] Kisswani: POGGERS
[4:02:27] Oakengrove: Pog
[4:02:31] Korupcija_: maybe it's out?
[4:02:37] killswiitch: nax?
[4:02:41] Kisswani: that's sick
[4:02:46] Ezekyler: same zone, differfent filter! towPog
[4:02:48] blazyturtle: fuckin sick
[4:02:57] Mummrak: And that music, i love it but could be a Halo game
[4:03:00] killswiitch: coxSeafood coxWiggle towPog
[4:03:08] MugiwarasNakama: @crashoverride_gaming and that frailty will leave them in an abandoned world empty and devoid of life. Seen it many times over the years with many MMOs. WoW is showing serious symptoms of MMOs during their last years
[4:03:23] Towelliee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExwgZuOclws
[4:03:32] killswiitch: it's okish
[4:03:36] Rygothx: Guess 9.2 is the end of the saga?
[4:03:41] Oakengrove: Trypophobia Alerts KEKW
[4:04:43] jmalmin: Maybe there will not be a 10.0
[4:04:48] Kisswani: that Dread Portal tho
[4:04:57] Kisswani: has the same symbol as the Dark Portal
[4:04:59] Ezekyler: 20 minutes recorded on a 60% flying mount, on a 300% it will take 5 min Kappa
[4:05:07] Oakengrove: Clip it Kappa
[4:05:21] Sarocus: I think Danuser has been waiting for this zone for a long time
[4:05:33] Sielu11628: @Ezekyler What's pessimism feel like?
[4:05:34] Oakengrove: 1 year from now this will be a golden take
[4:05:34] Korupcija_: leak it PogChamp
[4:05:36] theDirtyon3: HE KNOWS
[4:05:36] Morpserie: why would there not be a 10.0 lol wtf
[4:05:36] Ortinoth: 10.0 is next expansion
[4:05:43] Avinar: cataclysm 2 electric boogaloo
[4:05:45] Grunton: there has to be a 10.0 or idk lol
[4:05:50] dalvynthedrunk: Anyone who doesn't think there will be another xpac is omega silly lol
[4:06:05] cipusanx: based on how they did the story so far, I will not be surprised if they fail once again. Since N\zoth everything was a letdown
[4:06:06] Avinar: yeah we still got a cosmic war going on
[4:06:08] tylive52: @Avinar hahaha
[4:06:18] Ezekyler: buy the book, they will not answer that in game
[4:06:19] jeffnsteff2019: i cant wait to play it
[4:06:21] Morpserie: how did the happen happen antonnHmm
[4:06:29] xxxwaxyxxx: thats yearly time-gated
[4:06:31] Demented7: To be continued *
[4:06:41] Kisswani: " when a man a women love eacother very much , they exchange a special hug " there , explained
[4:07:09] tylive52: @Towelliee i say lets just pack SL up and go back to Legion with new raids
[4:07:15] Avinar: I just thought the creators were the ones of "technology and creating the shadowlands" I didn't think it was creation of ALL things. huh. Shows how much I've paid attention.
[4:07:20] Ezekyler: they invalidated Chronicles
[4:07:23] The_Loony_Bin: naaru?
[4:07:24] Kisswani: Naaru
[4:07:25] officialviz: Naaru
[4:07:26] Vondem: Naaru?
[4:07:27] volkreig: Naaru
[4:07:27] Morpserie: naaru?
[4:07:28] sifer007: KEKW
[4:07:30] Oakengrove: 🤔 Who's the god god of the god god god gods?
[4:07:36] Demented7: atpRtsd4

[4:07:56] Kisswani: quick , someone call Nobbel
[4:07:57] Avinar: well the chronicles were from the perspective of the titans, correct?
[4:08:01] ArataxGaming: That just means the Titan's hadnt been there
[4:08:04] Avinar: so it's just what they knew
[4:08:04] Sarocus: Because the titans didn't know about all that stuff
[4:08:11] Ezekyler: Danuser or some other dev they said time ago the Chronicles was written in the POV of Titans
[4:08:14] crashoverride_gaming: @mugiwarasnakama I can agree with that. Many factors but yeah. I just in my opinion think if you enjoy a game, just let me enjoy the game
[4:08:37] Avinar: so we could get another chronicles of the first ones with the TRUE lore of the foundation of the universe. Not from the perspective of the titans.
[4:08:42] Sarocus: Void lords arent part of the universe, are they?
[4:08:42] athedusgrimwilde: We were all miniatures in a game all along...
[4:08:44] Kisswani: They are creating " afterlives " apparently , I think they said that in the video
[4:08:49] DuploThief: @Towelliee overlay
[4:08:53] Oakengrove: "Just don't think about it!" - Danuser
[4:08:54] crashoverride_gaming: I mean I still enjoy monopoly “dead game” XD
[4:08:54] z01z: yea, shadowlands feels like stars, rise of skywalker, where they bring some bad guy out of left field and say it was him along lol
[4:09:01] dracullus: this zone will be just source of SL though, not everything
[4:09:06] The_Loony_Bin: well think of it like Oppenheimer. They created something dangerous while trying to make something "good"
[4:09:24] Grunton: its just the matrix all is good
[4:09:26] Kisswani: the shadowlans yeah , who knows tho
[4:09:31] Avinar: That's how I took it , that it's the creation of the afterlife and what to do with that energy.
[4:09:33] LordZzer0: yeap
[4:09:39] SnoWeazel: yeh
[4:09:53] dracullus: it was said in video I think, first ones created everything, but zereth moris was just for SL
[4:10:04] Ortinoth: i think its just for the realm of the shadowlands, not the universe
[4:10:24] LordZzer0: they created everything BUT Zereth Mortis especialy creates afterlives
[4:10:26] Oakengrove: WoW 2 Confirmed? POGGERS
[4:10:32] miriones: with that writing team i doubt
[4:10:36] Avinar: it's ok we will get a book explaining all this in 2 years LUL
[4:10:53] Kisswani: can this all be explained in a patch tho ? dont think it's feasable
[4:11:10] TheStarhammer: The Shadowlands afterlife seems like a joke.
[4:11:13] Sarocus: But that's not what he said. He said it is the start of the third and final part
[4:11:29] Rygothx: So we'll have Warcraft 4 then?
[4:11:37] The_Loony_Bin: Wait, I'm kinda outta the loop lore wise. Is the burning legion still a thing?
[4:11:43] Oakengrove: modCheck anyone seen Arthas tho?

[4:13:10] Kisswani: or just show the flow of souls from Oribos to the other realms
[4:13:20] Hjolt: what if arthas will help anduin get freed from his domination shackles? cause he retained some shred of humanity even when controlled
[4:13:20] Rygothx: We'll get our closure when Arthas and the rest are properly judged.
[4:13:23] Clicklesly: But he's a pala, palas have Judgment Kappa
[4:13:23] Ghost5392: I expect some arthas stuff in the Anduin fight tbh
[4:13:34] seaperz: I cant help it I just love arthas story and I want more
[4:13:39] miriones: Arthas redemption
[4:13:42] Grunton: what if the jailer just wins
[4:13:50] DuploThief: afterlives is the whole reason they can't not show arthas
[4:13:51] FerociouzMonk: arthas is a hygiene technician at mcDonalds Kappa
[4:13:53] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Ben had no judgment as well, please

[4:15:48] kimmo_gaming: Dannjy Crane in afterlife Kappa
[4:15:50] Severothh: @towelliee i really love WoW but do you think the future of WoW is going to be shitty tier sets and only cool items in the store going forward?
[4:15:56] Oakengrove: How did it go on Classic? You ded yet?
[4:16:44] Korupcija_: it's still too slow
[4:16:53] Malarick: if you were an undead did you really die?
[4:16:58] Epiclurker27893: Have the Druust been shown in the 9.2 datamining or are they likely being saved for 10.0?
[4:17:06] NinjaGlovz: LUL LUL LUL
[4:17:11] skeLEXtor: The slow leveling IS the classic experience.
[4:17:29] SSD511_: I level to 10 and  i say this is wrong and I back to retail
[4:17:31] Sielu11628: I want a Sargeras sword cinematic like moment

[4:17:52] Lucidtrix: hollowed out core.
[4:17:53] Malarick: I still think we are in N'Zoths vision
[4:17:55] RetiredNavyVet: sword gets removed, planet dies; game over, no more WoW... X)
[4:17:56] Aervyper: @Epiclurker27893 there hasn't been a single hint about 10.0. At least from what i heard
[4:17:56] Korupcija_: @skeLEXtor not for a seasonal thing
[4:17:58] Ghost5392: @skeLEXtor It was a part of it but for a lot of people it wasn't the fun part.
[4:17:59] Sarocus: They finally build a bridge between northern and southern barrens, and the Azeroth wakes up..   Crap!
[4:18:16] Attackroot: we gonna see deathwing again? lol
[4:18:27] Avinar: I had a pipe dream this xpac to see slyvanas die, but at this rate, she will just become the Lich queen. Now, the only thing I can hope for is that we get to see a teaser for a Titan world while they repair our world or something.
[4:18:33] RetiredNavyVet: end WoW; start building hype for WoW 2
[4:18:48] Oakengrove: I'd love to see Azeroth's titan form.
[4:18:49] qtla: I want to see  sargeras arive with illidan on his sholder and b***c slap jailer. But thats just me. @Towelliee
[4:18:50] Miklagart: first one azeroth
[4:18:51] skeLEXtor: @Ghost5392 Agreed!
[4:18:58] Aervyper: @RetiredNavyVet that's not working well over in overwatch atm
[4:19:01] madspeed312: who will control undeads in azeroth since there is no lich king? bolvard?
[4:19:01] Ezekyler: a murloc! towPog
[4:19:06] Severothh: I hope when we wake up from the dream the cool gear will b in the game not in the store ❤️
[4:19:08] lithium364: could also be an disapointment like the nzoth cinematic
[4:19:08] WQKPtheDON: just read the blizz is changing that  sus warlock set LUL
[4:19:09] Rygothx: Maybe in 10, the factions aren't fighting anymore so Blizz can now allow cross-raiding and stuff :)
[4:19:24] RetiredNavyVet: @Aervyper well, hype was there; dev issues aside...
[4:19:24] shimwood: It's murlocs all the way down
[4:19:30] Kisswani: Sargeras on a leash KEKW
[4:19:44] stressley89: nah
[4:19:50] Grunton: slyvanas will save everyone the redemption arc
[4:19:58] Ishva: they so did nzoth wrong
[4:20:07] Ezekyler: don't bet at that horse Towelliee, they always manage to disappoint people
[4:20:13] Oakengrove: Think Nelf Pally's will ever happen? Pepehand 🙏
[4:20:14] OGXanos: NB4 shadowlands was just a mindfuck dream
[4:20:16] Aervyper: @RetiredNavyVet overwatch 2.0 is an un needed expac just for a money grab to make people buy back into it i think they are going to pay for that huburis
[4:20:17] LordZzer0: Imagen srcret mithic fase with N'Thot
[4:20:25] aldonty_: doesnt he use a ability that unmaking everything during the fight?
[4:20:29] Festfolk: Sargeras just comes up with Illidan, rips out its sword from Azeroth and that triggers the new cataclysm like a second sundering in silitus.
[4:20:37] Kedemel: Personally... I just want Zovaal to succeed.
[4:20:39] Severothh: Maybe shadowlands is all just Na’zoth’s old memories
[4:20:42] Aervyper: @Towelliee have you watch Arcane? or Wheel of Time?
[4:20:49] sinlesssinner: use your safe word boys, hes a dominatrix
[4:20:52] Kedemel: Wipe it clean. Please. Free us, Zovaal.
[4:21:01] Grunton: he is the matrix we all in
[4:21:04] RetiredNavyVet: @Aervyper right, but because of the issues they have a chance to rethink it; we'll have to wait and see
[4:21:08] Miklagart: I smoke nzoth every friday night
[4:21:13] Suligane: To put it in the best way, Nzoth control the reality gem from the MCU
[4:21:20] aldonty_: it better be that we wake up from nzoth
[4:21:29] Severothh: It was the “Dream City”
[4:21:32] bigbadkenny93: Can I get a recap? Just got off work and missed the convo
[4:21:44] Kedemel: So we're scuffed MCU now...
[4:21:47] Aervyper: @RetiredNavyVet your a true believer more than me. The dream
[4:21:50] Aypex01: i want to wake up in pandaria with my class design intact
[4:22:04] OGXanos: He Knows
[4:22:26] RetiredNavyVet: bet Chromie is Azeroth
[4:22:31] Battakoru: Tow are u ready to say us about wow 10.0? XD Best regards
[4:22:33] Aervyper: I want ghostcrawler to make Riot MMO
[4:22:46] bigbadkenny93: @Aervyper They are workin on it, patience.
[4:22:51] Xoyzor: TBH after fighting titans and shit I have no idea how any other enemies will make sense
[4:22:52] aldonty_: chromie and nzoth banged thats whats up
[4:22:52] Moobot: Check out all of the new changes for WoW Classic Season of Mastery at Wowhead! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/season-of-mastery-som-overview-wow-classic
[4:22:55] Suligane: Is the jailer going to update the WoW engine? That would be nice hahahaa
[4:23:01] Kisswani: Sends us back to the war of the ancients please
[4:23:12] Zligodpoe: spoilers
[4:23:17] Grunton: and crossfaction raids
[4:23:19] Miklagart: no horde and no alliance
[4:23:22] Kedemel: Yeah, if Riot can keep the type of storytelling they're spitting out in Arcane within their MMO, it's going to be sick.
[4:23:24] nathrizen: whatever it is, i hope it's crazy
[4:23:26] bigbadkenny93: Idk if I trust Blizzard in their current state to pull it off though
[4:23:27] Aervyper: @Pashski have none don't even know what that P word is
[4:23:28] Kedemel: At least from a storyline standpoint.
[4:23:28] OGXanos: That would look a hell of a lot like the New World map
[4:23:31] Oakengrove: Troll expansion... literally KEKW
[4:23:36] Avinar: and that's when we get cross faction raiding
[4:23:38] Qeevdo: We did that in cata already tho Sadge
[4:23:38] maccaruso: Imagine.......dragons
[4:23:38] Demented7: Illidan and Hellscream go back in time and thats when they meet. Arthas that remains
[4:23:40] Kisswani: Broxigar went back in time anyway right ?
[4:23:41] Aypex01: war of the ancients would be us vs the burning legion. no thanks
[4:23:43] maisytuvas0: !ui

[4:23:48] aldonty_: the ending is that chromie and nzoth banged and time got all fucked up
[4:24:04] Hank_Chinaski: What are the chances of a WOW 2 withtin the next 2 years?
[4:24:06] bigbadkenny93: A man can only hope. Whatever 10.0 is, it's gotta be bigger than anything before.
[4:24:33] Aervyper: @Hank_Chinaski 0.0000000% What are the chances of D4 and Overwatch 2 in 2 years?
[4:24:34] Miklagart: my god no multiverses please. stupid mcu influences everywhere
[4:24:34] Wrongwaykid: what does attacking the world soul have to do with rewriting the concept of death?
[4:24:44] nathrizen: nah nah nah, it's gotta be a cataclysm-like change.  change it for everyone
[4:24:55] balart: @Towelliee bet it's going to be going to the past

[4:25:16] OGXanos: Knowledge is power champion
[4:25:17] Xoyzor: @Towelliee generally when time travel or alternative reality gets invilved into the story it goes to shit
[4:25:18] Ishva: hahaha

[4:25:22] mikejames01: lolol

[4:25:38] Avinar: Give me dadgar jokes, dang it.
[4:25:41] Wrath_Twitch: For Dalaran!
[4:25:46] Aervyper: @Towelliee khadger appears in the last boss fight and a dps has to silence him every time he begins talking or you just wipe
[4:25:46] Vch001: Mythic Karazhan UNDERWATER
[4:25:47] Aypex01: id rather move forward than go back
[4:25:49] Ordicos: and i thought magni will turn up
[4:25:53] balart: @Towelliee Khadgar was the best warcraft hero WoW has ever gotten in terms of storytelling ingame, prove me wrong
[4:26:03] lithium364: bobby will rise from the depths of azeroth, wow token in hand.. finally claiming what was his all along, our credit card information Kappa
[4:26:04] P4RC3V4L: SadFace
[4:26:09] OGXanos: Pre sundering reset would be easy to zone lock us though,
[4:26:10] ThaOriginalGamester: F
[4:26:12] Aervyper: @Hank_Chinaski i'm just being honest
[4:26:19] madspeed312: champion the universe needs you -magni

[4:26:25] RetiredNavyVet: we all get a ride on the Exodus, and flee Azeroth; WoW2 soon (TM)
[4:26:45] balart: @Towelliee WoW is going full star wars
[4:26:58] Aypex01: guys i want to play one class and one class only. whats my play?
[4:27:00] OGXanos: well, WoW DOES like to borrow from others..
[4:27:21] Kedemel: My dream scenario is that Zovaal unmakes everything and we get something of a fresh start.
[4:27:27] RetiredNavyVet: old game, new skins?!?! genius!
[4:27:28] Kisswani: How do you do that in a patch tho .
[4:27:33] lithium364: imagine they would do an starcraft diablo crossover, peoples minds would be blown
[4:27:37] Quojin: if time goes back to far there wont be a Horde as they wouuld still be on Draenor
[4:27:40] SavageCheez: To the Vindicar!
[4:27:46] Vch001: "Okay Your horde and alliance GTFO me" - Azeroth
[4:27:49] P4RC3V4L: WoW needs a LoKi like Disney has it LUL
[4:28:05] ThaOriginalGamester: We're all dead. Nzoth killed us when he was freed. What we experienced before SL was a hallucination. We will be reborn!
[4:28:07] balart: @Towelliee hopefully lore wise all this stuff happening was a dream and we wake up before the legion invasion and we go back to legion Kreygasm
[4:28:45] Kisswani: KEKW
[4:28:57] OGXanos: they changed the name of a planet? really?
[4:28:58] RetiredNavyVet: we're all just pawns in a chess match between Chromie and NZoth; time for checkmate!
[4:29:04] LordZzer0: We already had time trevel expansion. Remember how terrible was it story?
[4:29:04] luckfore: Eredath
[4:29:10] CrusaderNero: nah man... as always, wow lore/story speculation is ALWAYS better than what Blizzard actually makes & presents
[4:29:22] Iver_monk: Like eternals movie?
[4:29:25] FerociouzMonk: i hope all life cease to exist.
[4:29:54] maccaruso: What is this, Eternals?
[4:30:03] Grunton: like the new mcu movie
[4:30:15] Xoyzor: @Towelliee I don't think they go this deep into the story, they just read mostly random pieces of story and hope they kase sense
[4:30:20] StoicTaurus: That was old answer in Blizzcon QnA if i remember correctly
[4:30:22] P4RC3V4L: Just get Chromie to fuck up timeliens so they can write whatever the F they want Kappa
[4:30:25] 5_0_trees: @Towelliee why dont you use xtra rolls on this guy. Mogu Rune of Fate ?
[4:30:28] Kisswani: I think people think : Titans = big , therefore Titan birth = destruction
[4:30:28] Latharian: eternal movie
[4:30:30] Oakengrove: Time to hit the Retcon button.. again
[4:30:41] MC_Beefpunch: so are the planets armadillos rolled up, or are they eggs?
[4:30:51] RetiredNavyVet: Khadgar, stop talking or you'll break the spell!
[4:31:06] fraser_91: the titans never really seem that big except Sargeras at the end of Legion who was bigger than Azeroth its inconsistent
[4:31:14] CushyPop: A husk
[4:31:25] luckfore: i think the whole world soul stuff is dumb. just let planets be planets, do mess with them lol
[4:31:27] ThaOriginalGamester: do we lose our magicks?
[4:31:28] Oakengrove: So what.. planets are just giant eggs??
[4:31:34] luckfore: dont*
[4:31:34] Frosty1u1: if we are going back to azeroth mabye next xpac has something to do with titans and the world soul
[4:31:40] Plague_GG: Just go back in time before Zovaal was created and stop him from being created.
[4:31:43] SavageCheez: We will name it....Bob

[4:32:17] Ponzie: Not sundering. Just the well of eternity
[4:32:32] ShrenTheOrc: which is still there
[4:32:34] Ponzie: Sundering happened as part of War of the Ancients
[4:32:35] ThaOriginalGamester: WHO MADE HIS SWORD?
[4:32:41] jerseyfive: wtf I just want to do quests in durotar, what happened to this game
[4:32:48] MrRandomGaming: Not the well of eternity, pulling out Yshaarj created the maelstrom
[4:32:55] Oakengrove: Maybe he was "holding on" and ripped the world apart being pulled out?
[4:32:57] Arthur_eld: Azeroth get do much cosmic attention because of the worldsoul. Do cosmic entities even care about us without it?
[4:33:09] Sarocus: Or we take the spaceship with old Anduin
[4:33:09] zastin586: The old God being ripped out made a wound that was patched into a Well of Eternity, sundering was caused by an exploding Well of Eternity
[4:33:10] luckfore: but muh azeroth zones
[4:33:29] KingofMeccano: "WoW Azeroth Version 3"
[4:33:47] ShrenTheOrc: I got a feeling that the elves that died will be resurrected into like a new race or something
[4:33:47] Kisswani: Algalon eventually cared
[4:33:47] RetiredNavyVet: maybe we'll be on the back of a turtle for 10.0, then in 11.0 we'll get a new world
[4:33:50] Ioxium: kill off khadgar by him teleporting us all
[4:34:03] jkitchin75: @microbutmacro go away
[4:34:06] Eviltuna13: All i want to see in 10.0 is Gnome Paladins. everything else can go blow rooComfy

[4:35:10] BladeOne_: been there done that!
[4:35:15] maccaruso: 100% what will happen now....
[4:35:15] MC_Beefpunch: I mean, the portal *is* already there... it'd SUCK tho
[4:35:18] Epiclurker27893: Shadowlands implies most other beings don't know about Azeroth hence why the Night Fae used the play to learn some of Azeroth's history.
[4:35:19] Ezekyler: better to start playing the Garrison with the phone app then KEKW
[4:35:20] P4RC3V4L: WHAT IF.... Thrall was picked up by Lothat's sister and raised as part of the Alliance. GG

[4:37:55] Frank4LuLz: Azeroth becomes Ancient Earth
[4:38:05] devaston: we wake up having been in NZoths dreams since we met him
[4:38:18] Grunton: Early assess
[4:38:26] akia03: azeroth gets the maw treatment so we get some more maw we all want next xpac
[4:38:27] Frosty1u1: like soft reset for wow i wouldnt mind it
[4:38:27] JWoody82: they would have had to have been working on it for a long ass time
[4:38:28] Hjolt: Well if there's ever a time to renew faith in WoW it'd be now after a big letdown. i guess.
[4:38:30] Xarizak: BUT , u must remember one... To many ppls have to many achiviements and mounts and more.... Who lose this after wipe or new world ... leave this game for ever bro @Towelliee

[4:38:39] luckfore: there should always be a way to return to Azeroth
[4:38:40] Oakengrove: Invis Walls at the end of the zone? KEKW
[4:38:41] Malarick: naw thats a W0W 2 scenario
[4:38:47] WSquiggle12: What would we even do back on azeroth? BFA 2?
[4:38:48] Kisswani: whatever the scenario is , it has to be available after we fight the Jailer . That limits the possibilities a lot imo @Towelliee
[4:38:49] Caedranos: @JWoody82 they are always planning 5+ years ahead in story
[4:38:51] lithium364: lmao the 10.0 feature will be housing.... inside the map LUL
[4:38:53] unholyagony: we got to another world, and the alliance and horde join together to fight off the original inhabitants
[4:38:53] DegenerateHaven: i hope when azeroth explodes, the store explodes with it
[4:38:55] pronkk_: and then the horde can escape to Kalimdoor, because thats not Kalimdor
[4:38:55] lithium364: *maw
[4:38:57] OGXanos: What if it IS somewhere new, but 10.x is the last expansion, and they can reveal bits of this new place as needed in a seasonal style system like other games
[4:38:58] Frosty1u1: i think void lords will the endgame of wow but what they do after that?
[4:38:59] StoicTaurus: Thats why shadowlands takes so long .. most of the team works on expansion Kappa
[4:38:59] P4RC3V4L: I stick to Chromie fucking the timelines. That sounds brilliant.. if Marvel did it.. and we are about to have Female Thor... why not? whoever told them to stop smoking that plant , that guy should be fired.

[4:39:17] Battakoru: i think that azeroth will born easy :3
[4:39:18] im_n0t_jezus: it aint world of azeroth so new planet makes sense
[4:39:19] stressley89: chromie is the key
[4:39:23] Bezroth: azeroth wakes up rips a big hole some where, we go into hole that leads to the area where she was sleeping and that area is new expansion
[4:39:25] Frosty1u1: chromie dont get paid enough for this
[4:39:25] unholyagony: we got to another world, and the alliance and horde join together to fight off the original inhabitants
[4:39:31] BuffiDoinks: They got to go back to fighting less “GODLY” bosses
[4:39:34] Oakengrove: MuH AcHivEmeNT pOinTs!
[4:39:39] Xarizak: new world - meaning wow new world ;)
[4:39:41] P4RC3V4L: ya please
[4:39:41] Kisswani: whatever the scenario is , it has to be available after we fight the Jailer . That limits the possibilities a lot imo @Towelliee
[4:39:43] Sielu11628: Ey yo Chromes
[4:39:43] Frosty1u1: scooby doo this shit
[4:39:46] Malarick: WOW 2 is our decedents on a new world discovering what happened on Azeroth
[4:39:47] Frank4LuLz: Chromie is a sexy girl
[4:39:50] Eviltuna13: What if you had to roll new toons to do old content? rooThink
[4:39:51] luckfore: "going back to azeroth is a meaningful choice"
[4:39:59] snipsfan: that is good
[4:40:00] lithium364: im more worried not getting any 10.0 information til april

[4:40:25] Kisswani: Murdering the Natives FeelsGoodMan
[4:40:26] Hjolt: We dont care, not our first genocide Kappa
[4:40:26] unholyagony: this is murica. we take what we want

[4:40:31] thomaspxo: you just made the entire player base the horde
[4:40:32] fraser_91: but they also were killing each other first... I guess?
[4:40:37] Oakengrove: Everyone becomes Vegan. No more factions!
[4:40:45] Avinar: they are all corrupt by void lords!
[4:40:46] MrRandomGaming: Why not send the horde and alliance on two different worlds thats empty
[4:40:47] im_n0t_jezus: WE COME as liberators
[4:40:49] snipsfan: unless me are there mistakenly and they are just hostile as fuck lol
[4:40:56] TopherAllen: Anyone think of Azeroth if you have seen Marvel Eternals? (No spoilers)
[4:40:57] unholyagony: i agree. not our first genocide
[4:40:59] brokenjester: US AGAINST NAZIS
[4:41:07] RetiredNavyVet: we have factions, but they are created by the community
[4:41:10] Avinar: we are putting it on too good of a level. What will actually happen is something much less interesting Kappa
[4:41:17] Qeevdo: And endboss would be a void corrupted titan soul? PauseChamp

[4:42:04] MC_Beefpunch: #sargerasdidnothingwrong
[4:42:05] Ezekyler: in 10.0 we can conquer territories for our guild and earn revenue from it Kappa
[4:42:06] unholyagony: hes that misunderstood step child
[4:42:06] devaston: its activision, so we will end up in the world of call of duty as a new playable character in vanguard
[4:42:13] Frank4LuLz: Sargeras was innocent
[4:42:15] Frosty1u1: but then people would complain at a corrupted titan and just say legion ending 2.0
[4:42:18] Avinar: "Just because you are 'bad guy' does not mean you are really 'bad guy' "
[4:42:20] Eviltuna13: So we team up and round up all the people and place them into " Camps" and then move then to a zone with shitty living conditions? crreamNote

[4:43:22] xrandomdoodx: I'd be more excited if blizzard had a better recent track record  lol
[4:43:26] TopherAllen: There may be no world souls left after Azeroth. We know they are very rare and the the BL had already destroyed a lot of the universe.
[4:43:26] Kisswani: 100%
[4:43:28] theDirtyon3: LUL
[4:43:29] P4RC3V4L: LUL

[4:43:40] CDubTheRIPper: i just ordered a pizza and its being delivered by Leroy danP
[4:43:42] Ezekyler: Danuser it's the lead narrative, so it will be a trainwreck for sure
[4:43:52] Uther_The_Lightbringer: they said anyway that gameplay is above story
[4:43:58] P4RC3V4L: they wont they need their players back
[4:44:01] Oakengrove: KEKW Tru
[4:44:02] Uther_The_Lightbringer: so they will f up
[4:44:11] sinlesssinner: everything is getting leaked once the ptr is out
[4:44:12] Frosty1u1: did the 9.1 ending get leaked
[4:44:14] Bezroth: What if Azeroth is not corrupted by N'zoth but her body is taken over by N'zoth, old god in new titan body
[4:44:16] Ezekyler: we can't say that name here @Towelliee
[4:44:17] kredz13: blizzard havent got it right since legion before that was MoP and before that was wotlk
[4:44:19] MrRandomGaming: First i want to see more playeable races, classes, and player housing
[4:44:23] sinlesssinner: they might encrypt a couple cinematics
[4:44:25] unholyagony: if they focus on the story and not external systems, it would be so much better for the game
[4:44:26] Frank4LuLz: what you drinking @Towelliee
[4:44:27] CrusaderNero: whatever afrasabi had planned, Blizzard will do the total oppsite Kappa
[4:44:29] sinlesssinner: but dialogue is getting out

[4:44:59] Oakengrove: Plenty of scumbags can write. Not being a scumbag doesn't automatically mean you're a good storyteller

[4:45:06] unholyagony: N'zoth for supreme leader
[4:45:11] Frank4LuLz: nice, rum and coke is chill drinking
[4:45:14] P4RC3V4L: He gave a cool title
[4:45:15] Frosty1u1: you hyped for the algalon 2.0 second to last boss @Towelliee
[4:45:29] N3llee: @CrusaderNero no because what Frasbi had planed is the same story Chris Metzen has laid out for years.
[4:45:36] Ezekyler: well, if the Titans are invalidated, Algalon too
[4:45:38] Kisswani: He was the first sign for me that there was all this cosmic shit
[4:45:47] unholyagony: and we won
[4:45:53] OGXanos: I don't think we saw Algalon at full strength
[4:45:58] P4RC3V4L: Pog

[4:46:43] snipsfan: <3
[4:46:55] Avinar: yeah but I bet the hobo's would've loved you if you hadn 't stuck with WoW.
[4:46:57] junkrat_sky: N'zoth is sponored by Gfuel Vemon red ooze...lol
[4:46:59] Ezekyler: Ulduar was so good at that moment, sad Blizz killed it with Trial
[4:47:06] M2thew: whats wrong with sucking a good hobo d tho
[4:47:14] The_Loony_Bin: There's a dj called Mize who has the speech after you defeat algalon as the intro ito one of his mixes. Still get chills.
[4:47:15] CushyPop: Ulduar > hobo dick cheese
[4:47:17] CrusaderNero: @M2thew the dick cheese
[4:47:20] pronkk_: didnt ulduar come out after icc?
[4:47:28] Kedemel: before icc
[4:47:45] Plague_GG: No that was Halion @crusadernero
[4:47:46] Ezekyler: @pronkk11 ICC was the last, Ulduar then Trial then ICC
[4:47:55] Avinar: You probably wouldn't be drinking Melange #3 every other month.
[4:47:57] Kedemel: ulduar was the peak but ICC was so good too
[4:48:00] Eviltuna13: Cata was the best expansion for me because it game me my Gnome Priest
[4:48:05] Kedemel: i'll die on the Firelands was legit as fuck hill

[4:55:42] existenceisouroboros: Raid NotLikeThis
[4:56:00] Avinar: I thought a lot of people quit raid shadow legends recently. I hear it's not TERRIBLE as long as you don't pay for it.

[4:56:50] lildownie: yo, anyone know the song?
[4:57:01] Aervyper: LOTR music? i think
[4:57:21] Avinar: just be more casual I guess? idk I've heard of some people that are f2p that are sorta ok with their ranking over all
[4:57:26] anticensor_: w ResidentSleeper w
[4:58:04] Aervyper: yea but you gotta be ok with not bieng the best and never being able to compete with the best (hard part)
[4:58:26] scopes_doped_yt: its a video of a fellow first responder (fire fighter) who him and his wife were murdered yesterday and they left behind a baby boy. Was hoping to get my video game community behind it seeing as im an EMT. Its a small tiktok I made. Just trying to help in some sort of way. Wanted to ask before I got a strike from posting a link.

[4:59:15] MonarchTeaV: 3 weeks or so
[4:59:17] Avinar: I've never cared to be the best or compete with the best, especially on a mobile game. I take mobile games as a leisure , downtime game so I don't have high expectations or wanting to be high ranking etc. Just having fun and see what I get. @Aervyper
[4:59:22] theDirtyon3: you might have torn something then
