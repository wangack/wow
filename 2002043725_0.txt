[2:08:44] kirkhill89: That is hunter bis
[2:08:56] cyrex172: 10g is alot r now lol
[2:08:58] jontrann: its about 50g, hunter bis
[2:09:10] cyrex172: 50g??
[2:09:36] smokinkills: what server is the best to pick for SoD?
[2:09:44] headshot_hunter6: i suppose if you go do questing you can get 50g quite easily right now
[2:09:51] cyrex172: u like pvp or pve?
[2:09:55] Contendedlemon: can you resuse the ehncahnt?

[2:10:27] wildwittra: can a fresh lvl 25 run the raid or   is there a recommendation to get good gear first
[2:10:31] akia03: should be a 5-10k dps upgrade per dps
[2:10:56] cyrex172: @wildwittra u should be reasonably geared

[2:12:13] Molvonos: They're bringing the resists down to where they should have been.
[2:12:17] aigamingdk: :(
[2:12:23] Molvonos: Kelris having 75 Shadow/Arcane Resist was stupid.
[2:12:41] Molvonos: And the Priestesses having 75 resist across the board was worse.

[2:12:47] aigamingdk: arh okay, that makes sense, just dont want them to nerf it to the point where its a walkover
[2:13:11] Molvonos: Which also means Mages won't get their Counterspell resisted when it's necessary
[2:13:17] falldrgn: Thats one way to "nerf" the fight
[2:14:13] Molvonos: I mean, with the SIlverwing Trinket will reduce boss Resist to -10 at this point
[2:16:08] LimpyMcGee1: 75 arcane resist made mage healers just obsolete on that fight lol
[2:16:25] headshot_hunter6: you know about the safe spot behind the boss in the dance phase?

[2:20:27] warbringer159: not bringing a hunter is pretty much handicapping ur raid

[2:22:48] o0trees0o: can just get in areas behind eggs to help dodge murlocs
[2:24:05] Molvonos: Having two rogues with windfury make up for the hunter in spades tbh
[2:24:49] akia03: only if the feral stays alive
[2:24:56] Alaquane: 1 rogue not in windfurry group?
[2:25:01] Molvonos: I mean.
[2:25:09] Molvonos: If the hunter dies, what good are they, with that logic?
[2:25:13] Molvonos: Cmon.

[2:33:06] Molvonos: Holy Pallys and Resto druids are in the worst place currently, among the healers.
[2:33:14] Molvonos: If the charts are any indication of it
[2:33:17] o0trees0o: yeah not sure just giving advice
[2:33:27] R0t0kan: yup

[2:34:33] ravenwingz0405: beacon being locked behind rep is so bad
[2:34:34] FLCarguy: you want a resto Druid in your raid
[2:34:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rep grinds are good for toys but not so great for player abilities
[2:34:54] ravenwingz0405: and you will oom casting straight holy lights

[2:40:00] cyrex172: 2
[2:40:01] akia03: does the cardshop you use ever buy your cards?
[2:40:06] Molvonos: @o0trees0o That repair guy doesnt show up until murloc boss is dead.
[2:40:07] Synoxin: But i think you have to get the boss down first
[2:40:10] cyrex172: @wEiRdO_dUdE 2 hours!>>>??? fuuuk
[2:40:10] ticonis: ghost repair guy left of the pearl tp?
[2:40:11] DJsweep: @synoxin no
[2:40:12] R0t0kan: dont you have to kill this guy to get repair dude to show?\
[2:40:23] ClassicMalcontent: I do feel bad for Resto Druids and Holy Pallys capping in P1 at 25 is rough for their abilities even with SoD.
[2:40:25] Molvonos: BOSS HAS TO DIE TO HAVE REPAIR GUY SHOW UP.
[2:40:30] Molvonos: BOSS IS CLEARLY NOT DEAD.
[2:40:47] o0trees0o: oh yeah no repair til after this boss
[2:40:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the last few times the maintenance went fairly quick, didn't use the whole scheduled time
[2:40:58] R0t0kan: its like a feral showing up with no winidfury
[2:41:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Damn, that's unfortch
[2:41:36] Wulfgrym: molv rage lvl increased

[2:42:01] cyrex172: lol
[2:42:04] LimpyMcGee1: So, for repairs, molv has to solo the boss and then turn in a quest at darn?
[2:42:16] Molvonos: @LimpyMcGee1 Yes.  I'm the main character, it's me.
[2:42:23] Wulfgrym: paladins need summon now, has to happen =D

[2:44:23] REALPolarbeezy: Therapist Towelliee
[2:44:23] Molvonos: "We've noticed you're bad at moving the fuck out of shit, maybe if you did as they say, and git good, perhaps you'll survive longer."

[2:47:01] DJsweep: you mustve got summoned
[2:47:16] Wulfgrym: ground is a raid technique aka potato mechanic
[2:47:19] Molvonos: If the Rogue's taking excess damage that is very avoidable, then it's not on the healers.

[3:09:44] FLCarguy: full top down camera angle really helps during march of murlocs phase. just be towards center of room

[3:41:30] harveyfrank: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:41:31] abracka_: i wouldn't have a problem with it, if we could carry more than 1 unfulfilled supply crate at a time
[3:41:35] abracka_: it's annoying asf we can't
[3:41:38] JakloomGaming770: the supply crate is awful, im never getting skull bash
[3:41:39] ArcaneSyntax: They just need to make it so you can have more than 1 crate at a time
[3:41:51] Buttscratchrr: I wish they would change the creates... able to be hand in at the inn just not going to the cities to hand them in
[3:41:56] thecynicalshuffler: can u hold more than 1 supply crate in your inventory now or is it still just one?
[3:42:09] ArcaneSyntax: I spent a few hours grinding it out the other day, sucks.
[3:42:20] CodyDaBrodie: Beacon
[3:42:28] drunkieduckie: I think stuff like that is why I swapped back to retail.  love sod, but the weird QOL issues frustrates me more than I’d like.  too casual for that nonsense
[3:42:32] ArcaneSyntax: Make the runes account bound pls
[3:42:33] Alaquane: I liked the rep grind more than the dang ratchet rune
[3:42:42] Wulfgrym: warrior dual wield rune
[3:42:45] Sir_KnightErrant: supply crate is easier than the fish oil, munitions and shredder parts imo
[3:42:46] Tiamarilien: Beacon!
[3:43:28] abracka_: if they're adamant about keeping it behind that rep, drop the requirement to friendly
[3:43:34] abracka_: why the fuck is it honored required
[3:43:50] ArcaneSyntax: The reputation doesn't take that long, but the crates are annoying to farm.
[3:43:52] Buttscratchrr: Rune should be all easy to get
[3:44:17] akia03: didnt they drop it to froemdly
[3:44:19] Wulfgrym: feel like the devs want to die on that hill
[3:44:23] Slaanesh74: should be able to get the rune after like 5 turn ins
[3:44:25] akia03: friendly
[3:44:30] hateful88: it’s interesting to them them implement something NO ONE asked for and it be a system that people have historically hated
[3:44:30] rymerre: i would like the crate system more if it wasnt so f'in rng
[3:44:40] hateful88: to see them*
[3:44:42] ArcaneSyntax: The high level crates give 500-800 rep you can get honored pretty quick, the hard part is the dumb crates don't stack.

[3:45:14] HiggiTV: elwynn
[3:45:17] polkaman85: landing is the red skull by the southern river homie

[4:23:05] headshot_hunter6: you have the auburdine area
[4:23:08] ClassicMalcontent: Enjoy Cata Classic! I's a 'classic' too far for me. I'm good with Wrath or before era and SoD besides retail/modern. Getting off the 'era' train for anything cata or later.
[4:23:18] headshot_hunter6: but you need to get the ferry from wetlands
[4:23:18] Syntrium: I haven't @CodyDaBrodie
[4:23:26] HoboFighter2: Yeah Darkshore 15-16
[4:23:30] Foretoldlegends: Honestly. At the route you're talking about, I can see you at level 23 before needing redridge.
[4:23:32] CodyDaBrodie: @Syntrium easyyy quests there
[4:23:33] gfield2k: @Syntrium there's a lot of jumping zones in classic WoW. That's why questie or rested XP is great.
[4:23:38] Celicon: sounds just like how I level lol
[4:23:41] MindYaManas: westfall has some quests up to like lvl 17 and 18 right?
[4:23:47] ClassicMalcontent: I like SoD. I like Retail. I like Era.
[4:23:48] Submarine_Mike: yeah I did Auberdine and got to 19 from lvl 14
[4:24:00] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: why dont  people  like Mop!
[4:24:06] gfield2k: Facts
[4:24:11] PadidinJones: All the haters will be playing Classic Cata. guaranteed @Towelliee
[4:24:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: cata classic is just the mop classic waiting room for me
[4:24:25] Gruntz_Inc: @gfield2k whats good bro
[4:24:28] ClassicMalcontent: @GriFFFoN_ZGZ I liked MoP. I just won't go back.
[4:24:36] Foretoldlegends: Also phase 2 will be interesting with the Stockade power leveling.
[4:24:42] KonceptionZ: yeah people saying that they wont cata classic are cappin
[4:24:47] ClassicMalcontent: I'm not a Cata hater. I played it. I enjoyed it when it was current.
[4:24:53] OviTheGray: i wont play cata.. but i'll watch people play it HypeLUL
[4:24:55] b_lappy: there's always retail pvp Kappa
[4:25:00] Mckhero: cata was fun people jsut mad it was a challange for once
[4:25:02] MindYaManas: warlords was kinda meh for me though.
[4:25:09] notColt45: The heatmap in HC for redridge is all red LUL
[4:25:23] ClassicMalcontent: @KonceptionZ should I stream deleting my Wrath era toons? I'll watch it but won't be playing.
[4:25:30] DRS8Sonic: FOMO
[4:25:33] Foretoldlegends: I think my only hate with Cata was the talent squish and maybe how the last two fights in Dragon Soul went. Everything else wasn't horrible.
[4:25:35] AllenWins: Wrath classic Kappa
[4:25:35] drunkieduckie: cata was a challenge.  those initial dungeons at launch were tough and fun
[4:25:45] MindYaManas: exactly FOMO
[4:26:03] Cuddle_Bunz: @Foretoldlegends not a bad take
[4:26:14] Molvonos: @ClassicMalcontent I legitimately think you're way too far down that rabbit hole.  The fact you're willing to delete characters because of whatever candle you hold for WotLK, is insane to me.
[4:26:23] ClassicMalcontent: @drunkieduckie oh yeah when it launched cata dungeons required kiting. Something may were not used to having to do since
[4:26:29] drunkieduckie: what expansion had the broken warrior dps shield spec?
[4:26:31] blooodraine: men  its so sad to see the day before dying.. tbh

[4:26:53] notColt45: All seem fine
[4:26:54] MindYaManas: when in doubt just roll EU.
[4:26:54] rymerre: moo cow has 5% more hp
[4:26:55] Foretoldlegends: I also like how they're using the teleport to previous instances in order to go to Vanilla Naxx, Vanilla ZG, or TBC ZA.
[4:26:55] FubarSnafuJJ: Tauren
[4:26:55] BriLightZone: i have a softspot in my heart for cata since thats when i started playing
[4:26:56] Verdell263: I loved the interview Ghostcrawler just did saying the devs were shocked when players complained about Cata difficulty on launch.
[4:26:57] Tormac1129: tauren?
[4:26:58] SamuraiWillZ916: troll
[4:27:03] drunkieduckie: do draenai
[4:27:08] segarth: Yes, so sad to see a scam die....
[4:27:09] KonceptionZ: the day before launch
[4:27:13] AveragePvp: cow for hp Pog
[4:27:13] BriLightZone: troll or orc
[4:27:14] HextileGaming: the end is nigh
[4:27:16] blooodraine: not how it looks now.. but when they showcased it... i realy hoped they could make the hype real
[4:27:28] chefdejour82: troll pve orc pvp
[4:27:32] HiggiTV: you wanna tank-shamie? tauren 4 win
[4:27:33] SamuraiWillZ916: what eu server we gong to?
[4:27:33] Molvonos: Shaman depends on what you're gonna be playing.  I imagine Tauren is still best race for tank.
[4:27:47] MindYaManas: ghostcrawler was there in the thick of it back in the day. he shouldn't be shocked.

[4:28:21] Chapag3tti: lol
[4:28:26] Silverboltz_Pax: oh owww i huet my shield
[4:28:28] ClassicMalcontent: Oh yeah Cataclysm was CC required.
[4:28:28] Foretoldlegends: Some Cata dungeons don't seem that hard. It's just when people want to do mechanics is another thing...

[4:28:53] Shugaze: ghostcrawler post was something
[4:28:56] chefdejour82: CC is the key in cata
[4:29:01] KonceptionZ: @ClassicMalcontent thats fair, xpacs after wrath dont evne feel like wow classic i bet
[4:29:02] KingSlayerYotam: DF season 3 just shows how much dungeons are more fun when they are easy. M+ is so much better now, no way im playing a season again when dungeons are hard
[4:29:19] HiggiTV: 1 cc was needet
[4:29:19] chefdejour82: always need mage
[4:29:22] free0rda: Cata 5 man ZG ZA were awesome
[4:29:32] Aquadriel: those casters in halls of origination oof
[4:29:37] Shugaze: was hurting the casual base
[4:29:37] KonceptionZ: retail wow lol
[4:29:48] ClassicMalcontent: @KonceptionZ I mean... I'm glad others will experience it. I rememeber all of them I'm just good with the SoD etc and Retail. Others experiencing it will be cool to watch.
[4:29:53] Shugaze: yeaaa
[4:30:06] vulkankragon: i remember that line LUL
[4:30:08] MindYaManas: he's been around forever, he was in the thick of it, ghostcrawler, must have goldfish memory.
[4:30:08] drunkieduckie: I had to tank on my warriors early cata.  I was not wanted as dps hahahah
[4:30:23] menzo1337: "Break yourself upon my body..."
[4:30:30] PadidinJones: omg HOO trauma
[4:30:38] menzo1337: Stonecore was a beast
[4:30:42] Wilya: Goldfish have surprisingly good memory
[4:30:46] ClassicMalcontent: I'll watch Cata Classic. As I am playing the many variants available.
[4:30:50] Slaanesh74: I played healing shaman in cata launch. was a 1 man army. ranged interrupt, multiple forms of cc, awesome heals
[4:30:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah the difficulty went way up from Wrath
[4:30:56] Aquadriel: grim batol dragons at start oof

[4:32:06] tlsmith3638: i mean he wanted to burn pallys to the ground back in the day i figured ghostcrawer would be you #1 enemy
[4:32:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sub numbers were not good in Cata, and that was part of it
[4:32:13] HoboFighter2: @GriFFFoN_ZGZ They said Gnomeran I believe
[4:32:20] Foretoldlegends: @GriFFFoN_ZGZ I think it could be RFD. ZF is late 40's.
[4:32:36] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: ooohh true
[4:32:38] KonceptionZ: KEKW
[4:32:45] MindYaManas: Cat was pretty popular, I think the sub numbers were up there.
[4:32:45] PadidinJones: All because of Flying in Azeroth
[4:32:45] MattyNiceTV: i believe the peak amount of subs was at the beginning of cata
[4:32:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Retention fell off in Cata
[4:32:57] notColt45: But number go down instead of up Kappa
[4:32:57] dave3ooo: wrath was the peak
[4:32:58] free0rda: I vividly remember my friends quitting the game for good in the middle of OG cata dungeons. I appreciated the challenge at the time as was sick of wotlk style dungeons.
[4:32:59] AnguishTM: @just_kirk_ 45? but they say 2h incase some renders don't work out. essentially
[4:33:04] Bernardo994: I watched your crazy but 300 day this year. looking at my stats
[4:33:05] MindYaManas: I think the sub numbers dropped off in WoD because ... WoD...
[4:33:08] Bernardo994: butt*
[4:33:09] Molvonos: 12 to 11.4 isn't a big drop for retention.
[4:33:09] rymerre: yeah it peaked but it tanked and it was the start of the overall decline
[4:33:14] Silverboltz_Pax: Cata had a rough intro due to SWtOR and Rift releasing @ same time
[4:33:15] CeruleanStar: yeah probably RFD but i dunno maybe ZF raid would be great for 40 and ST raid for 50
[4:33:17] vulkankragon: wonder how they will proceed with classic after mop
[4:33:31] Molvonos: Some of ya'll have a very skewed concept of what 'Tanked' means.
[4:33:42] AllenWins: +10 social credit
[4:33:46] HiggiTV: 40 is gnom...
[4:33:53] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: yeah zf can def be a rid

[4:34:25] Aquadriel: i thought that was wod when it declined
[4:34:37] Molvonos: Every expansion had tanking and decline!
[4:34:44] dave3ooo: but blizz has some screwy ways of defining what an actual "sub" is
[4:34:47] MindYaManas: me too @Aquadriel , It fell off sharp in WoD
[4:35:08] Zapp_Brannigan86: Yeah lol "tanked" only 11.5m subs for it
[4:35:12] tehrobtar: it's because everyone is a professional business analyst when it comes to wow LUL

[4:36:20] vikaelzidek: hi i died and was born again i "rebirthed" u guys mind telling me wtf ure talking about
