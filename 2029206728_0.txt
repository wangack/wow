[4:53:45] thebigbellbeefer: I need some help with a suggestion if anyone can help. Raid group has one mage - that player wants to bring their aug (gear is about the same) is it more worth to have the mage buff & damage, or bring the aug for overall? (Heroic)

[4:54:52] mukkkyyy: @thebigbellbeefer doesn't really matter in heroic tbh, technically mage buff is better overall depending if u have a lot of casters but if ur healers arent struggling its a tiny diff

[4:57:32] PromiscuousToilet: @Evohunt_tv ty
[4:58:14] thebigbellbeefer: Thanks @RiiSei @mukkkyyy a little more clarification - the group is rather lack luster. Healers struggle a bit ( i think mostly with debuffs) dps is moderate, a few pumpers but around 4-5 deadweight. Would your answer still be the same?
[4:59:39] RiiSei: @thebigbellbeefer i mean, in my opinion, if both the characters are somewhat equal, youre better off having the player on the class they're happy with, especially if the group is very casual
[4:59:58] DadBodGeoff: this is a crazy comp for a 29 rise holy shit
[5:00:27] mukkkyyy: @thebigbellbeefer same answer i would say yeah, if you were heavy on blaster casters then mage is slightly better, but if its fairly balanced then aug also buffs damage overall and reduces damage taken so its negligable
