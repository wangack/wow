[1:50:57] lukaskar: It just looks like they are spending more time on store mounts creating new ideas for them then on the game mounts (ofc there has to be something interesting in the store to buy it) but its just a bit sad that we got to this point where you buy cosmetics for wow
[1:50:59] tehrobtar: he's such a troll, god love him xD
[1:51:00] GPTurismo: dragonshire would be a better game
[1:51:02] Gruffian: Most store mounts are recolors too
[1:51:04] feelu_: mr jebaiter
[1:51:05] Kisswani: LMAO
[1:51:08] GPTurismo: oh he loves trolling people on twitter lol
[1:51:08] Aquadriel: for clicks and engagement KEKW
[1:51:11] qoyote: I see you are doing Korthia, is that the new zone?
[1:51:12] obbi87: @Towelliee just answer yes i seen it, every 5min. Then you will automatics answer all the people who asks :P
[1:51:13] dyslexican1: Fucking troll, I love when a troll actually gets me.
[1:51:15] Mazeltough: @Towelliee what is the headband you got on?
[1:51:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: looks real to me Kappa
[1:51:27] Birder_L: but it looks just like concept art 2020Suspicious
[1:51:27] dracullus: because he knows people are really, really stupid?
[1:51:31] Kindr1d: the mount specials is my problem
[1:51:34] laito_: did u react to the new mrgm leak? it looks legit Kappa
[1:51:53] Ferrolune: Fallen Charger bruh
[1:51:56] dracullus: 9.1 had more mounts than whole Wrath
[1:51:57] Nico_vdM: The people that work on mounts aint the same people that develop the game
[1:51:58] Kindr1d: they legit have the coolest specials when you have mounts in game that do like a roar animation
[1:52:07] Scoodles91: and 1 store mount per tier :D
[1:52:11] Aquadriel: asmongold logic LUL
[1:52:11] cabalish: dont go down that asmonrabidhole
[1:52:13] mavericks312: the hand mounts are better then anything on the store
[1:52:14] Lestatis: i'd buy the crap out of that snail mount coming!
[1:52:17] Shidopie: Glory mounts don'tfeel unique anymore tho
[1:52:17] Sincline387: dur dur dur asmon says so
[1:52:19] Valestrus: store mounts are unique. in-game mounts not so much @Towelliee
[1:52:28] flebbooo: I stopped caring about store mounts after like legion, its just annoying hearing Asmon and others act like its something thats killing the game LUL
[1:52:31] Yagr6: TheIlluminati  Q
[1:52:33] Kindr1d: i mean he's not wrong if that's his take
[1:52:33] Ferrolune: never stop streaming, permanentlöy 500 IQ
[1:52:33] vavvor: its the EU people i at that time KEKW
[1:52:35] cahoots82: High IQ relative to those around... which ain't saying much =D
[1:52:37] PattiFord: :D
[1:52:37] swordart_19: Asmon Ape spotted
[1:52:42] r0b928: It might be up to 7.5 today
[1:52:44] mmo_kenna_: Lmfao :D
[1:52:46] theNebuchadnezzar: @Towelliee ppl hate the store mounts cause they clearly have better assets., have more time spent on their design, have fucking animations, the quality is clearly higher than the  others you can get in game
[1:52:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: Idiocracy is a documentary
[1:52:52] PattiFord: leave your brain in the locker
[1:52:57] KragnosWoW: "Dragon deez nuts" spoiler meme is so good LOL
[1:52:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: we are getting dumber as a people
[1:53:01] spizzoo: bitches gotta bitch
[1:53:02] theNebuchadnezzar: regardless of volume
[1:53:03] qoyote: More mounts than patches.
[1:53:13] cabalish: @HaxzorJimDuggan i fn love that film
[1:53:19] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee, do a joe biden... What a stupid son of a bitch!
[1:53:19] Mecabeast: idc about the 3xtra animations or recolor of store mounts I care about the fact polygon count on store mounts is usually alot higher than in game mounts
[1:53:23] swordart_19: @thenebuchadnezzar envious aren't you
[1:53:38] FatChase: Fuck your life, bing bong
[1:53:39] Kindr1d: maybe both parties have a point
[1:53:42] swordart_19: Store mount Enjoyer GIGACHAD
[1:53:48] theNebuchadnezzar: @swordart_19 Nope just observant
[1:53:49] Kolargol: I dont get Asmongold. Complaining about storemounts, but he buys lvl 60 boosts and wowtokens. wtf logic is that??
[1:53:50] Sincline387: hating on store mounts is fine, trying to claim that they are the reason for other bad things in game is at best foolish....
[1:53:50] Aquadriel: flebbomate nazjatar crab, hippo from pvp BfA, ardenweald craddle and frog, scorpion from SoO, and all mythic raid mounts, thats just to name you a few that are actually unique.
[1:53:50] denflup: sleepy Joe
[1:53:52] GPTurismo: Because eventually the aniamtions/wireframes make it to in game mounts.
[1:53:56] qoyote: Its clearly more than 2 mounts.
[1:53:56] lukaskar: No I mean that it can get to the point where scales might change that they will start creating more for store instead for the game. I do agree that there are more mounts in game and that they are doing one or two in a year for now. I just don't want it to go the other way where we get 2 mounts in game and 20 in store a year
[1:54:06] DiiscoViking: Lets go Brandon
[1:54:16] eldercandle: people just repeat asmon lol
[1:54:18] flebbooo: @Aquadriel Big true, very real my man
[1:54:23] GPTurismo: I mean, a big thing Asmon's only big point he made is how they banned /spit faster than the n word
[1:54:30] Aidler: the fascinating thing is that Asmon manages to make the shit he spills sound so clever that many people believe him
[1:54:30] fatalnote: It wouldn't be as bad if they had put in half the effort in the in game mounts
[1:54:38] Strayer_J: @DiiscoViking  / spit
[1:54:40] KragnosWoW: Yeah they definitely did one for each "year of"
[1:54:41] PattiFord: think about the tree mount... 2-3 people plus the sound guys?
[1:54:42] belfastcl: @GPTurismo yeah that was kinda weird
[1:54:46] Nico_vdM: Imagine the poor person that spent months just working on 1 store mount to have their work insulted like this
[1:54:49] freehongkongm8: kekw
[1:54:49] Aervyper: @Sincline387 it's frustrating when year after year the only thing blizz does right or good is the bi annual sub mount
[1:54:57] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee They should just make an Invincible recolor and listen to the people complain
[1:54:59] Quakezilla69: people just live to bitch about this game
[1:55:01] Ferrolune: Fallen Charger Pog
[1:55:01] freehongkongm8: the in game mounts are so much better lmao
[1:55:03] KragnosWoW: heavenly golden cloud serpent
[1:55:06] Okri24: People think that 4 people working on a mount (to say a random number) is the whole team working on it and not the other 100 people who work there
[1:55:09] richgambit: MOUNT SPECIAL LOOKS AWSOME
[1:55:10] Shidopie: I just wish Glory mounts wouldn't be a reskin of like 3 other ingame mounts
[1:55:11] mmo_kenna_: Spit on me all you like, I'm looking fly on my tiger
[1:55:14] OhNoNotAgain: What about Abyss Worm Towelliee
[1:55:17] swordart_19: @aervyper if you think like that why do you car or even post at this point move on
[1:55:20] Kolargol: @Volly lol he really did that?
[1:55:22] GPTurismo: I have black and plague proto drake, they aren't the highest res but I flex with them
[1:55:27] Ratthard: It's hard to stop farming mounts when you are in the zone. I'm closing in to get all the mounts and you really want to have all shadowlands mount before 9.2.
[1:55:31] Aquadriel: @Towelliee show off the Crab so these morons stfu
[1:55:33] Nobbel87: tastes different i suppose lol
[1:55:36] senseofpurpose90: they literraly dont want to pay costumer service, i would doubt they would keep someone for the mounts this long, so yeah, the mounts were all done 1 month 10 years ago, and they have been drip feeding us this all time xD
[1:55:39] JLmorten: JLmorten subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months, currently on a 68 month streak! 
[1:55:44] kayohara: poor horse
[1:55:47] iRage1776: @Towelliee next year will be a Rabbit, the mount follows the Asian Zodiac
[1:55:48] Brodih_: The only store mount thats truly original is the boat
[1:55:48] freehongkongm8: Lucky Yun is pretty fire NGL
[1:55:50] HopeThePriest: All the asmongold simps chillin in this chat ha ha
[1:55:52] digitoxity: but the store mounts do more summersaults
[1:55:53] PattiFord: maybe they compare the specials of store mounts with the regular ones
[1:55:53] Shidopie: If store mounts were awesome everyone would buy them
[1:55:56] GPTurismo: yeah, we need to get Asmon to collect mounts >.> rich cheapskate lol
[1:55:56] rohdey: half of the store mounts are sht as  it is
[1:55:57] swordart_19: @senseofpurpose90 stop lying
[1:55:57] flebbooo: fr, people are actually freaking out when there already are so many unique mounts, holy shit
[1:56:00] Morphlink: so wow atm have, buy full game, buy expan, buy wow token (p2w) plus mounts on the store and mogs too. great game :D
[1:56:02] denflup: dude you have the magic roosteR¡?
[1:56:08] Mazeltough: @Towelliee just got Reins of the White Polar Bear!!!
[1:56:08] Yagr6: you just destroyed that poor horses ego @Towelliee  LUL
[1:56:13] denflup: thats expensive AF right know
[1:56:17] swordart_19: Asmon apes strong in channel
[1:56:19] Ldysansa: You got me motivated to do mount farming. I have really enjoyed it. Lets you see places in the game that you may not have seen before
[1:56:22] dracullus: @Towelliee recently we had book mount - looks amazing, no grind, no RNG, no store, pure effort, did 'I don't have meaningful stuff to do' guys got it?
[1:56:25] dyslexican1: People love to cmplain or cry about "pay to play" even when its so wrong and makes no sense.
[1:56:25] GPTurismo: sylv mount high res texture
[1:56:28] DiiscoViking: i like the Kodo mounts
[1:56:29] jerexify: @Towelliee Squeakers is the only store mount I'd put up against some of the in-game mounts. But, I have Invincible now, so there's that...
[1:56:30] Quakezilla69: archimonde
[1:56:31] lukaskar: sorry for starting this @Towelliee you are right there are only few mounts on the store that they show you and the in game mounts are awesome
[1:56:32] senseofpurpose90: @swordart_19 im half trolling and thats your answer? funny
[1:56:33] OhNoNotAgain: Jaina mount
[1:56:34] rohdey: Blackhand

[1:56:37] Scoodles91: the promotion fire tiger thou, from HOTS
[1:56:37] Qeevdo: Garrosh
[1:56:39] dugarg_: thats the best endgame boss mount ever
[1:56:39] Nicoz971: Better or not I hate anytype of cosmetic like mount or transmog on  the store of anytype of game period
[1:56:42] Aervyper: @Shidopie i remember the gold dragon and how cool i thought it was so i bought it and went to stormwind AH and released BLEEP everyone bought it LOL
[1:56:43] kimmo_gaming: Its so ugly that its beautiful Kappa
[1:56:45] Strayer_J: @morphlink you dont buy game lul you living in 2009
[1:56:48] Kolargol: @Volly doesnt surprise me. He`s an asshole, thinking he is so smart, but in fact hes pretty ordinary with some idiotic takes...
[1:56:49] Kinghorn: shackled urzhul is best mount in the game that is cheating
[1:56:49] cannibaal_: How do you feel about swift spectral tiger being re-released to purchase in Chinese only region TBC?
[1:56:51] swordart_19: @senseofpurpose90 of course you are trolling when called out clown
[1:56:51] medanmarko: A mount designer cant influence or change the ENTIRE WOW!!! He designed mounts, that's his job, task, whatever. He cant rebalance, make, create, design the entirety of WoW! How do you think this works? A single designer reads a reddit rage post and chooses to redesign WoW and the entire company says "Right on bro! Do what you like!" Jezus...
[1:56:52] fatalnote: When I say effort I don't mean that  non of the ingame mounts are good. But the Effort in making it is obv different. The special effects animations for the store/6  months mounts is on a different level
[1:56:56] dugarg_: wtf there is a fish?
[1:56:56] t_train_va: It's almost like cosmetic items are subjective

[1:57:59] Kolargol: More storemounts please!!!
[1:58:10] sigilla_: The book mount from mage tower
[1:58:22] Nico_vdM: More like they heard someone say "store mounts are better than in-game"

[1:59:01] OhNoNotAgain: *insert surprised pikachu face here*
[1:59:04] essadis: there's 12 months in a year?!
[1:59:05] digitoxity: its almost as if 6month sub mounts come out every 6 months
[1:59:08] Morphlink: @Strayer_J im 100% sure wow is not f2p
[1:59:08] Nicoz971: Yeah, all the new mounts on the store are ugly and have no unique design
[1:59:10] LoseAlotLuke: WAIT there are TWO 6 months in a 12 month YEAR
[1:59:15] trrow96: When does the news drop?

[1:59:24] ZakuzaGB: its not a big deal i agree.  Its nothing to get "angry" about these days, but sometimes i do wish some of the in game mount had the same level of quality put into them but thats just me
[1:59:24] iRage1776: @Towelliee next year will be a Rabbit
[1:59:24] signeddudu: Can you imagine a company trying to make money? Nuts.

[1:59:25] cabalish: do you guys dont have mounts ?
[1:59:26] dyslexican1: Look, its a mount you get for FREE if you do a 6 month sub, like your ass aint guna sub for 3 months. They are giving it to you for FREE stop crying.
[1:59:26] Kinghorn: towelliee is going to become the hokage
[1:59:27] fatalnote: I again have nothing against store mounts if the mounts they gave us ingame had more effort. Outside of the cutting edge mount. 2.5k rated m+ and all I got was a different colored same mount

[2:32:17] magiccanvashands: top or wrath
[2:32:22] Duekov: All I'm saying is, if RWF gets like half of its normal views, wouldn't you agree there's a decline in popularity?
[2:32:23] Poriand: @Angry_Sully Mounts!
[2:32:29] 11000BG: @N3llee true, for so many games its same. like international for dota 2 or cs go majors

[2:33:34] KragnosWoW: isnt race to world first this year going to be the best since u cant test the last 3 bosses?

[2:35:19] Winpimplaren: "Doing the work myself?" DansGame
[2:35:28] 3663Sharad: Senpai spillin da beans NODDERS
[2:35:28] cahoots82: Why would I look up the information when I can just spew bullshit and wait for someone to correct me?
[2:35:32] N3llee: its a big day for the TBC players
[2:35:34] N3llee: in WoW
[2:35:34] Sajakain: I just got done soloing the Shadehound. Still no mount.
[2:35:40] Copsonson: How soon is 9.2 coming?
[2:35:42] codedizle: people want just to hate on wow for anything but we all know they came back for patches and expansions launches LUL
[2:35:44] 11000BG: bellurar is one of those youtubers who goes with the flow angry wow ranters, just for views
[2:35:54] KragnosWoW: 5head
[2:36:14] MrGhostlore: almost like real world politics LUL
[2:36:29] Duekov: I live by Cunningham's Law! If you don't know what that is, look it up :v
[2:36:31] Mecabeast: remember when wow was getting shit on by the media cause people were dying in the early days
[2:36:31] codedizle: LUL
[2:36:38] Sajakain: If the logic is sound, though, and proven then there's nothing wrong with using it as a basis for your own opinion.
[2:36:40] scrappy_zg: I will play WoW on and off til the day it dies.. good or bad it's part of my life and some of my fondest memories come from it
[2:36:43] KragnosWoW: every day feels like house of cards up in this bish
[2:36:55] ClipCraft: gm did you do any more worm attempts
[2:37:02] Calphurnious: We're almost at a point in time when the haters come full circle and back to hype for the next expansion
[2:37:11] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Loot drop scaling xD
[2:37:25] 3663Sharad: @Duekov there are to many that go with this law i fear LUL
[2:37:32] senseofpurpose90: A scalling system of loot odds should be in place like with legendaries in OW, what do u think @Towelliee ???
[2:37:33] GermanBacon: towHi hi

[2:37:43] scrappy_zg: the game will have cycles of shitty gameplay too. At the end of the day the combat is well honed and fluid. Something no other MMO in my opinion has been able to come close to.
[2:37:43] grandmatb: you know how on dead servers, they "shut down" zones if people havent been in them for 15 mins? makes sense... but if we try to farm world spawn mounts, if resets their spawn timers :(
[2:38:08] nodramajustpizzaa: so is there a confirmed date for 9
[2:38:08] Kisswani: is there a catch up for Venari rep ? I didn't bother with the Maw early , and now I hope there's a faster way to get rep there
[2:38:11] nodramajustpizzaa: 9
[2:38:15] nodramajustpizzaa: 9.2
[2:38:23] scrappy_zg: Faction merge would make alot of ppl happy too, but it won't ever happen
[2:38:24] senseofpurpose90: In ow loots boxes are increasingly lickelier to get the more you dont get them
[2:38:24] lekkahdh: lekkahdh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! awwwwyeah!
[2:38:29] jerexify: @Towelliee They should introduce some kind of loot improvement chance... Call it, I don't know, giant-forging or something... ;)
[2:38:40] Gremmel: I know exactly why I don't like retail. The more ease of access system they add the worse the random encounter with another player gets. Still don't even own Shadowlands but play the other two versions
[2:38:43] Sajakain: My Prot Warrior runs around with Sack of Terror.
[2:38:52] morningporr1dge: anything interesting in 9.2? worth resubbing? havent played in few months
[2:38:53] magiccanvashands: 2020 with more than 953,000 concurrent viewers at shadowlands launch Asmongold is the top streamer in the category with a peak of more than 220,000 viewers that day
[2:39:14] N3llee: @Towelliee will you be checking in on an of the streams of guilds looking to clear BT/Hijal first?
[2:39:19] grandmatb: you know how on dead servers, they "shut down" zones if people havent been in them for 15 mins? makes sense... but if we try to farm world spawn mounts, if resets their spawn timers @Towelliee

[2:39:31] LordKain73: once again I woke up at 3 am...asmon was on and was STILL complaining about the store mount.... turksKEKW
[2:39:52] GermanBacon: or you just got your BiS lego on you 2nd m+ run Maw NODDERS
[2:39:54] morningporr1dge: @willybattery its the last patch before 10.0?
[2:39:59] montanushd: Do you dislike asmongold and bellular?
[2:40:08] eakiller: blingtron gift can give one
[2:40:13] 11000BG: i still remember my first leggo in legion. came back to wow after vanila and after few days i got leggo. was so hyped :D
[2:40:20] ClipCraft: do you like SL or legions legendaries more?
[2:40:39] Sayryn: Nothing better than the mailbox lego
[2:40:45] kokochris: yup i got a blingtron one.. like I won the lottery
[2:40:52] Daddyknut: got my first leggo from a HC dungeon, my reaction was "really? -_-"
[2:40:57] VIRUSplw: legion is my best expac even tho i had really bad luck with legendaries
[2:41:00] cahoots82: I got an engineering mount from blingtron once
[2:41:19] Duekov: Yo Towelliee WotLK Classic - you playing or pass?
[2:41:37] mobbo: I hated legion legendary acquisition… didn’t get my 2 best legendaries until Argus
[2:41:50] kult7: !yt

[2:42:11] Donswag3: I'm at 97.8% for Invincible
[2:42:27] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee means you are in the top 1% of ppl not getting the mount from her :D

[2:42:34] mobbo: Rarity %s are meme %s
[2:42:38] dracullus: @Towelliee well it's 95% you get it at least once in shit ton of runs, not 95% per run
[2:42:54] Kisswani: filthy 1%er Kappa
[2:43:16] racketpunch: which class are you rolling in Lost Ark
[2:43:18] mobbo: I finally got Mims head last night after 330 attempts
[2:43:19] SonofHorus82: I feel like I'm doing something wrong for Mimiron's Head. All the runs every week and bupkiss so far.
[2:43:20] Endin: it's payback for the one run mount in mechagon Kappa
[2:43:20] Kisswani: @Edgexcalibur towHi
[2:43:21] NickLeonhearth: I'm at 160 on her, no worries will catch up soon

[2:43:54] cahoots82: Some korthia rares do give venari rep
[2:44:05] Cabbageman007: Do you have the 10,000 Apex crystals mount??
[2:44:24] Lexi__Marie: i wish there was a stygia transfer
[2:44:32] rohdey: theres 1 for each cov thats 4 mount ser
[2:44:32] dugarg_: yeah that was the first mount I linked to you :D
[2:44:46] cahoots82: isn't there a stygia transfer item already @Alexis___QT
[2:44:58] ClipCraft: ye
[2:45:00] hrdstylem: yeh
[2:45:01] dugarg_: each char needs to be exalted
[2:45:06] swordart_19: There is 1 for each covenant
[2:45:06] dugarg_: with deaths advance
[2:45:07] rohdey: if they're XX renown with each
[2:45:08] swordart_19: yes
[2:45:11] ClipCraft: and exalted
[2:45:19] hrdstylem: you can go to oribos and change covs
[2:45:20] Lexi__Marie: @cahoots82 its only 250 and ita rare i think
[2:45:30] ClipCraft: yes
[2:45:33] Yagr6: game the system BABY
[2:45:33] swordart_19: You need rep just swap covenants
[2:45:37] rohdey: done
[2:45:37] swordart_19: Yes
[2:45:44] cahoots82: yes, just recolors
[2:45:45] rohdey: it's the 4th recolor
[2:45:46] SonofHorus82: weren't reps supposed to account bound at some point? or did I dream that?
[2:45:48] ClipCraft: recolors
[2:45:53] Kisswani: this is so dumb LUL why can't the game recognize that you got 80 renown with all covenants
[2:45:53] dugarg_: I suggest doing that before the end of the expansion
[2:45:59] BattleKnoedel: yes
[2:46:02] cahoots82: Yes. It's a new mount for count.
[2:46:02] rohdey: ofc
[2:46:05] swordart_19: Different colour
[2:46:15] swordart_19: I think yes
[2:46:31] dracullus: lazy devs why 40th mount in this patch is a recolor
[2:46:45] rohdey: i wish i had the motivation/willpower to do the meta achieves
[2:47:09] Kurincion: Herizon Foibidden West has officially gone gold. Nice.
[2:47:27] Kisswani: @Kurincion so hyped for that game
[2:47:34] cahoots82: Crab mount special = best mount special ever
[2:47:55] Ertra: whats the crab mount special?
[2:47:58] rohdey: are you borderline bamboozled?
[2:48:01] dracullus: @Towelliee you are wasting time, just do weekly for 1500 rep, in meantime you can for example farm mounts from maldraxxus emissary, they are stacked today
[2:48:04] Suligane: @Towelliee where do you get the crab mount?
[2:48:05] cahoots82: It digs down into the ground and then pops out
[2:48:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @Ertra it burrows into the ground
[2:48:13] SonofHorus82: total war warhammer was actually delayed back into February from December.
[2:48:15] Akermay: Because all Feb games were delayed into Feb :D
[2:48:17] cahoots82: and does a little dance
[2:48:20] N3llee: wtf tbc servers beeing taken down right now with no info
[2:48:21] Ertra: @Ertra ha cool!
[2:48:23] Duekov: 9.2 is delayed hehe just kidding
[2:48:35] Kurincion: other than 9.2 lololol
[2:48:39] Kelsillium: Ve'nari only seems quick to farm by killing rares because it's no longer time gated with eye of the jailer right?
[2:48:45] Hizirin: new gw2 expansion also seems to make it in February
[2:49:41] LordKain73: I'll be playing dying light 2 in feb
[2:49:54] siixmodes: towHAMUP
[2:49:56] atmfees: is patch date announcement typically done 3 weeks out?
[2:50:08] KragnosWoW: will 9.2 let us fly in korthia?
[2:50:14] pakopola: yoo, when do you think the new expention will be revealed ?
[2:50:27] atmfees: ah so we're not getting this date for a bit
[2:50:37] dracullus: @Towelliee for patches? not really, it's usually 2 weeks before
[2:50:43] KragnosWoW: im so lazy LUL
[2:50:51] Duekov: You decided to go back to raiding mythic in 9.2 yeah?
[2:50:59] atmfees: you don't NEED it, but still want it
[2:51:05] fancyjoe: no flying= lazy developers
[2:51:06] mobbo: Once 9.2 is out I hope that zone dies
[2:51:15] MrGharr: 9.2 release on feb 15 maybe?
[2:51:36] Kisswani: I enjpyed most of what shaowlands had to offer , but man the Maw might be my least favorite zone ever
[2:51:43] sigilla_: I also just want the 10.0 announcement. Just to know.
[2:51:53] dracullus: @Helyiolasz I think 22nd, right after love in the air

[2:58:50] Quakezilla69: something fun to do
[2:58:54] Quakezilla69: easy
[2:58:54] Shocksadin: lich is awesome
[2:59:05] Motraxtv: D:
[2:59:10] SicDogg: wotlk FTW
[2:59:15] nezgeel: ye when litch king comes out i will be back
[2:59:23] pixxelina: wrath is generally overrated
[2:59:23] Shocksadin: <---tbc baby.... but i love me some wrath
[2:59:31] PidiaP: Actually most subs was the release of Cata towSip
[2:59:32] Shocksadin: well...bc i should say
[2:59:34] magiccanvashands: I played classic vanilla because i wanted to do the world buff speed runs and the i did the without world buffs challenge in naxx
[2:59:34] AlphasaurusRexx: yeah, but back then it was difficult and novel. As soon as it comes out everryone is going to one shot everything within a week like they did TBC
[2:59:34] dozilla: Raises hand
[2:59:34] handlebarswow: I'm on of them :)
[2:59:40] Shamwise: So when classic catches up to retail, now we playing warcraft warcraft
[2:59:47] LordKain73: WotLk > all baby...still not going to go back to play it again though.
[2:59:55] piratechris: Wrath was awesome so I'll be playing that for sure
[2:59:58] Suwah84: Probably not a hot opinion but I thought MoP > WotLK
[3:00:06] thetorque162: once a week only
[3:00:28] mario32: they shouild have a  buttonn to turn pvp on n off
[3:01:02] sardow90: i could nt think of anything worse than questing in boring tundra
[3:01:19] Duekov: I think WotLK was popular for 2 reasons - story closing out from WC3 and also 10 man raiding introduced which made it easier to group for a lot of people. I know kara was 10m, but that was only first tier raid. 10m raiding through an entire expansion was great
[3:01:25] magiccanvashands: Warlords was the Pinnicle of Gaming when it came to Warcraft Expacs Hands down
[3:01:27] grubzy_1: I loved Cata tbh
[3:01:30] dozilla: Insanity
[3:01:36] magiccanvashands: LAWL
[3:01:37] Ertra: @natewar90 i always opted to do the fjord instead of the tundra

[3:02:21] Winpimplaren: 5 different types of badges. Kreygasm
[3:02:27] LordKain73: yup, if you were a wc3 player, WotLk was top for you.
[3:02:28] swordart_19: You guys are overrating things
[3:02:30] Spykex02: I loved the music, zones, and story with wrath. But tbc is my favorite expansion.
[3:02:32] Kinghorn: gear score PogChamp
[3:02:36] Clawanorder: I mean 10 man raiding in a way made it easier to get into raids making it more casual?
[3:02:37] thetorque162: How much rep do you need?
[3:02:40] MrGharr: @Chosen2chose Qwik tweeted "coming weeks"
[3:02:42] AlphasaurusRexx: idk imo Wrath is going to die quicker than TBC. The nostalgia will wear off quick.
[3:03:00] Aidler: and the story of WotLK was easily understandable for everyone
[3:03:04] swordart_19: @clawanorder OMEGALUL nope 25 man easier
[3:03:09] flyingbufanda: Pretty sure WOTLK was popular because people loved TOC. Best raid... ever.
[3:03:10] snackbacon: @AlphasaurusRexx 100% agree
[3:03:14] gyllygan: When is Lost Ark dropping?
[3:03:15] N3llee: Man tbc servers offline and there hasnt been any blue post
[3:03:20] SonofHorus82: yeah I loved Wrath because I played a shit ton of WC3.
[3:03:28] Kinghorn: yup

[3:04:29] Kinghorn: you need to do first boss of hyjal
[3:04:42] N3llee: Be cleared in 2hrs
[3:04:42] Shongoshi: 3 hours sound like slow kill
[3:04:46] Quakezilla69: it'll be less than that
[3:04:59] magiccanvashands: We are going to smoke Illidan tonight
[3:05:00] N3llee: If live is same as PTR it will be less then 2hrs

[3:05:35] kandor01: "progress"
[3:05:37] Herecomeslullaby: im dying, what is happening in 2 hrs?
[3:05:42] N3llee: But there are some other lesser known contenders

[3:06:58] Shongoshi: I though all interest in SoM died long ago
[3:07:02] harrekun: SoM is dead now... kindas
[3:07:03] Svendv: SoM looks like a release of a release to classic imo
[3:07:03] grubzy_1: SoM has maybe 30k players?
[3:07:05] harrekun: kinda*
[3:07:06] grubzy_1: if theyre lucky
[3:07:08] vadder_fister: som is dead bru
[3:07:12] Ensanee: Wait new world is already dead???? knew it would only last 3 days
[3:07:18] Akoudadis: whats up w/ the naruto headband?
[3:07:20] Ertra: @Ensanee new world isn't dead
[3:07:31] mario32: hey @Towelliee  what u think about this suggesting they should add a button to turn on n off for pvp
[3:07:40] kalrick1: after they killed Hardcore Rag i dont think anyone plays SoM anymore lol
[3:07:50] Ensanee: @ertra stop with the copium, game is very dead
[3:07:53] Aidler: so what's not dead is the question...lol
[3:08:03] Herecomeslullaby: any 9.2 release date?
[3:08:14] clamthenerd: HC classic is dead and it wasn't even a legit rag kill
[3:08:22] Korupcija_: he's talking about classic
[3:08:26] Screamnsteam: living under a rock OMEGALUL
[3:08:33] Joneeeez: @clamthenerd what do you mean not legit man?
[3:08:49] illistplays: plz no
[3:08:50] rohdey: i think it's stupid you have to go to Org/Sw to turn wm back on tho
[3:08:53] clamthenerd: no one got the real rag kill. They swapped people in and out to get to rag
[3:08:59] clamthenerd: no group did a full rag run
[3:09:01] illistplays: pvp is life
[3:09:02] PhillyDilly18: They just made pvp honor changes to TBC Classic. They are starting to be more free with changes
[3:09:04] kalrick1: lol very true
[3:09:05] Kelsillium: I though classic had /pvp?
[3:09:08] grubzy_1: that HC stuff is super cringe, just making rules up as they go
[3:09:13] Kinghorn: clamthenerd eweaseDerp
[3:09:24] Duekov: I'm wondering when they change M+ up - I don't see why they haven't added a challenge mode for it that isn't timed, but like way harder (have to CC mobs in trash pulls)
[3:09:24] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:09:27] Thdlock: rwf isnt legit either since we have 30 players for a 20 man raid
[3:09:28] fistofnature: clickbait LUL
[3:09:31] Kinghorn: he is saying it does not count because they changed rosters for bosses?
[3:09:35] Kinghorn: he is a moron
[3:09:36] Aravarth: @Kelsillium It does, there are Classic SOM PvP Servers
[3:09:41] TiredCarcass: new classic isnt so classic
[3:09:46] Clawanorder: Thd OMEGALUL
[3:09:49] clamthenerd: It's a real kill, but no one did the full road. If you didn't do all bosssess, you can't claim you did R2R
[3:09:54] KragnosWoW: same dude
[3:09:57] KragnosWoW: i never got to do it
[3:10:07] Aidler: nothing is legit and everything dead Kapa
[3:10:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @Kelsillium that was if you were in a controlled territory. you could turn pvp on there and be able to fight opposite faction. if you had it turned off then they couldnt attack you. in contested territory, PVP is always enabled
[3:10:16] Duekov: MoP Challenge mode was everyone had scaled gear yeah?
[3:10:21] Kinghorn: for sure Aidler
[3:10:29] Kinghorn: why play anything everything is meaningless
[3:10:31] montanushd: @Towelliee what did u think about Cataclysm?
[3:10:34] ashwing_: MoP CMs were the shit. Had to prepare a lot for those
[3:10:35] magiccanvashands: Warriors where gods in MOP arena
[3:10:52] AlphasaurusRexx: gawd MoP arena was sooooo good
[3:10:59] RagingPunk: that crabmount is cool
[3:11:01] swordart_19: @duekov it is called Torghast I doubt you have flawless
[3:11:02] im_n0t_jezus: sick one
[3:11:06] Aidler: nihilism at it's best
[3:11:12] magiccanvashands: I know I miss MOP Arena So Much
[3:11:18] Kelsillium: the torghast horse mount is super easy now
[3:11:20] ashwing_: recollor of Fallen Charger one
[3:11:28] BigD530: do you think they should have left in M+ for Legion after they had it for timewalking, and should they re-institute M+ for BfA?
[3:11:39] Kelsillium: all levels flawless
[3:11:41] im_n0t_jezus: all flawless
[3:11:45] h00rayforstuff: yeah
[3:11:53] Lexi__Marie: easy if you have raid gear
[3:11:53] h00rayforstuff: all wings flawless on +12

[3:11:59] thetorque162: all wings at 12 flawless
[3:11:59] Lexi__Marie: but not for everyone
[3:12:01] Scoodles91: only 12
[3:12:03] h00rayforstuff: not levels just wings.
[3:12:04] rohdey: all wings at 12
[3:12:05] Kelsillium: just do 12 floorless for all wings and done
[3:12:09] dugarg_: all the different wings
[3:12:09] ThePrivatesParts: will 9.2 be last content patch of shadowlands before 10.0?
[3:12:12] h00rayforstuff: yeah
[3:12:13] ashwing_: Flawless 12 every wing
[3:12:20] dwrfygames: Twisting corridors
[3:12:24] joe_g_433: @theprivatesparts yes
[3:12:30] Duekov: @swordart_19 What? I asked a question about MoP challenge modes not sure why you're attacking me lol
[3:12:37] swordart_19: Flawless is 12 yes can spam it
[3:12:42] h00rayforstuff: no it's easy. Just takes time because of the weekly rotation
[3:13:21] swordart_19: @duekov dude just YouTube it ,8y is not challenge when you can literally afk boost people OMEGALUL get down yours rose tinted glasses

[3:14:44] Joneeeez: and mount!
[3:14:49] Duekov: @swordart_19 Again, you keep attacking me and talking about a Torghast challenge. I asked a question about a Mists of Pandaria challenge mode dungeon. Not sure why you're acting this way.
[3:14:52] MrGharr: @zeitgeiz prepatch is 10.0, as always.
[3:14:53] Ertra: oof
[3:14:54] Kinghorn: womp womp
[3:14:55] Kelsillium: I did adamant vaults so many times trying to get a specific cloak ornament only to find it isn't available from Adamant vaults.... hate that place now
[3:15:01] Quakezilla69: i got it first try :)
[3:15:21] swordart_19: @duekov I said mop is not challenge and was talking whole time about it

[3:35:18] VordiDi: when you swap the covenant, do you get to keep your farmed anima or its gone? @Towelliee
[3:35:41] MOLAR305: hate corruption all you want, but holy shit do i miss TD

[4:15:21] MOLAR305: owners worth does not equal the teams value
[4:15:21] frickitdk: im hyped their not testing the last 3 bosses publicly
[4:15:21] assman_ny: Fan gear, the list goes on
[4:15:21] grovics: Just cause the owner is worth it doesnt mean the team is worth the same amount.
[4:15:32] CardinalTX: Cowboys 6 billion.  Still can’t buy a super bowl
[4:15:33] Spaede: Isn’t Musk the richest person in the world at 330 billion? 700 billion sus

[4:16:42] MOLAR305: all scotches are whiskeys as are all bourbons
[4:16:51] sl1nky1981: The only thing Dallas can buy, is perennial unwarranted hype
[4:16:56] Namtarts_TV: the richest people on the planet are cartel leaders and the saudi royal family. bezos and musk are just people that have to declare their wealth
[4:16:58] queeflabs: @towelliee i actually work for the company that makes the irish distillerd packaging and stuff for rebreast, so chances are youre opening the boxes i made .. boring but trivia!
[4:16:58] SmokedHog: bourbons are way better imo
[4:17:01] Namtarts_TV: its not the same thing
[4:17:02] wanderlust81: macallan is nice
[4:17:18] SmokedHog: scotch tastes like dust
[4:17:26] grovics: @Suligane theres a legendary shield in black temple? what?

[4:18:25] Short_Film: THIS IS THE ONE
[4:18:41] sgreth: Scotch Flex.   Definitely not something you'll find in a 20 year old streamers repertoire :D
[4:18:44] Lostdogal: Peated Scotch like the Ardbeg or Laphroig are the best scotch for my taste. A nice easy drinking blended scotch like Monkey Shoulder is nice as well.
[4:18:59] queeflabs: ive started drinking the balvenie, its gorgeous
[4:19:02] queeflabs: really earthy
[4:19:06] SicDogg: @Towelliee do u like whey and nephew rum ?

[5:21:23] dugarg_: if they want players to keep playing it ofc they will cut it off
[5:21:24] 1dollarMike: you cry its p2w and its not
[5:21:26] MezTheMartian: boosting in wow doesnt accelerate the end game progression like a currency direct character upgrades does...
[5:21:41] CrusaderNero: @MezTheMartian true!
[5:21:52] xHukk: @1dollarMike The definition of P2W is being able to do it, even if you don't have too.
[5:21:52] 1dollarMike: so wow is p2w then since you can buy gold and pay for ingame boosts?
[5:21:56] chavodk: p2w lol
[5:21:57] Th3Hammer: witch hunters are a plague
[5:22:04] Mufinz21: @MezTheMartian yea but according to the argument some are making here, the WoW boost saves the player time, and if it saves time then it is p2w
[5:22:04] CrusaderNero: @1dollarMike correct :)
[5:22:05] Phalamore: @Halgrender Exactly. The P2W in this game is basically no different than in WoW with buying wow tokens then turning that gold into boosts. In both cases you are using real money to progress your character faster
[5:22:10] thenormalbeast: Part of Europe :/ NL and BL not available
[5:22:15] Holysal: @MezTheMartian you can buy gold with wow token and buy boes. so yes you can
[5:22:15] 1dollarMike: Ok @CrusaderNero we can agree there than
[5:22:31] Mufinz21: go look at the comments
[5:22:33] mavericks312: never ask for "constructive"
[5:22:34] Mufinz21: lets see how bad it is
[5:22:39] CrusaderNero: @1dollarMike so thats p2w but you deny its anything of that in lost ark? thats funny
[5:22:48] dugarg_: Good video
[5:22:48] 1dollarMike: its a line
[5:23:01] 1dollarMike: AND you wanna cross the line that its ENTIRELY p2w and its not
[5:23:03] miriones: lost ark will kill wow
[5:23:05] CrusaderNero: @1dollarMike can you or can you not spend real money and upgrade your pve gear?
[5:23:09] Brodih_: i'll pay for a package just to encourage since this is such a great game
[5:23:19] 1dollarMike: yes you can...and you can do that in wow too
[5:23:23] 1dollarMike: BUT you dont have to
[5:23:32] 1dollarMike: just like you dont have to in wow
[5:23:34] campingking615: Thanks the Bears have a new head coach
[5:23:35] falldrgn: That was a quality video.. well explained
[5:23:40] N3llee: @Towelliee he has another one that goes into the founders packs and getting most value from them. Its really good
[5:23:41] biirrd: He had a very nice video voice!
[5:23:46] thenormalbeast: PvP is really cool
[5:23:57] Neldur: Just because wow does it does not make it right. One thing to keep in mind.
[5:23:58] ejectdic: hey guys
[5:24:03] Draco_wolfstein: its all about playing your way and its your money
[5:24:06] Phalamore: @Towelliee can you link that video please?
[5:24:07] Ralf_9900: sup HahaDoge
[5:24:10] Auradus: yeah mind your own business gold buyers
[5:24:17] ThisIzD: high end raids are static ilvls as well I believe
[5:24:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: paying money for gear upgrades wont make you a better player in pve when it comes to doing the mechanics of the fight properly
[5:24:21] luckfore: wow? KEKW
[5:24:27] Screamnsteam: click to move pvp PepeLaugh
[5:24:32] Halgrender: My point is, im good if you think this game is P2W, as long as you think the same for WoW.
[5:24:33] Sacura_Shadow: seems similliar to gw2 in a way
[5:24:51] biirrd: I would say that wows Pay to win is much wors
[5:24:54] cowhooff: any idea when 9.2 will be released?
[5:24:54] Mufinz21: ill be curious to see how viable whaling in the game is, cause people screamed p2w at bdo but very few people have the wallet to spend to the point where it was
[5:24:56] Auradus: tab target pepega @Screamnsteam
[5:25:05] Yosmo: more damage in pug raids
[5:25:20] Maydie6066: @Towelliee cam switch please
[5:25:21] MasterNewt: Because MMOs essentially are not single player games, they are games where status and achieving something gives greater value to the game. To be completely oblivious to other gamers goes against the logic of MMO.
[5:25:22] Mecabeast: only if I get denied from a group because player a bought better gear for irl money
[5:25:22] campingking615: The Colts need a new defensive coordinator
[5:25:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: im glad people do that so the game is funded and I don't have to pay for shit
[5:25:28] KillaPr0: that is just a waste of money
[5:25:33] TeritoTV: theres no p2w available in wow
[5:25:36] Screamnsteam: @Auradus completely different lmao
[5:25:46] IianaDRK: from what ive seen from sywo's videos, paying to power ur gear in lost ark is so expensive its just not worth it
[5:25:48] luckfore: in wow you can get 10/10m with BIS gear with 0 effort and just ur $$
[5:25:48] 3663Sharad: @TeritoTV WoW Token
[5:25:53] N3llee: @Towelliee he has several good videos up that talked about end game
[5:25:56] syla90: @TeritoTV really? token and boosts ?
[5:26:07] assman_ny: Well spoken.  Constructive comments only please haha.  I like that dude.
[5:26:07] biirrd: @TeritoTV HAHAHA... are you sure?.. you can buy gold, pay for a full clear + gear run.
[5:26:08] Wrizzik: "it's p2w this is bullshit" versus "it's my money, I'll do what I want"
[5:26:09] Phalamore: That is correct
[5:26:11] KillaPr0: i only care no pay to win for pvp
[5:26:19] SonofHorus82: what do we win?
[5:26:21] Draco_wolfstein: its a point of a view also person skill with the game is important
[5:26:26] Halgrender: PVP in LA looks VERY nice
[5:26:28] Phalamore: Hell Mode= Normalized gear
[5:26:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: @SonofHorus82 debt
[5:26:44] KragnosWoW: when does lost ark come out for free?
[5:26:44] Thoreya: my coworker is bugging that theyre doing tier 3 on launch. think its gonna ruin everything
[5:27:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: its limited tier 3 at launch
[5:27:06] Holysal: Lost Ark is mechanics based fights anyways. gear wont save you if you cant do that
[5:27:13] Soulphantom_84: paladin main?\
[5:27:25] MezTheMartian: theres still competition in PVE... what if that guy gets the raid spot that i feel like i earned and he didnt, but instead bought. Or what if i care about parsing as a representation of hard work and skill combined, but i cant compete against players with lower skill because they were boost past my level of hard work enough that it outweighs the skill. i dont really give a fuck, but thats the argument
[5:27:36] Screamnsteam: Do you think Lost Ark players will take the FF14 players crown in the "my game isn't allowed to be bad" mindset?
[5:27:40] StreamElements: Use code POG-TOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorBot #ad
[5:27:45] syla90: @MezTheMartian play solo
[5:27:58] TeritoTV: @syla90 in game currency can buy marginal player power in any game whatsoever. Wow tokens dont suddenly make this a p2w model lol
[5:28:05] KragnosWoW: is there any class like the demon hunter in diablo for lost ark?
[5:28:06] pigzip: Fix pov
[5:28:24] Gingerprimer: There is not really anthing you win with buying boosts except even if you get gear you do not win at anything
[5:28:25] TheGaoSora: ban boosts, kill BoE's from raids -> token become for cosmetics and sub only WeSmart
[5:28:40] Sacura_Shadow: thank you its so hard to say that to people sometimes XD
[5:28:44] Soulphantom_84: ff14 pretty good but story requirement put me to sleep
[5:28:51] Mufinz21: thank god
[5:28:52] Thoreya: LUL
[5:28:54] TheGaoSora: LUL
[5:28:55] Screamnsteam: EZ Clap
[5:28:56] Gingerprimer: Baning boosts lul
[5:28:57] KillaPr0: good
[5:29:01] Templexx: think ppl will move on once ppl realize its not
[5:29:04] Sollice: I was tired of hearing it
[5:29:04] pacificmc1: Phey Tu Ween
[5:29:12] Sollice: I did it not Gattz :P
[5:29:25] Wreckagetv: pai to when
[5:29:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: money 2 succeed Kappa
[5:29:31] Screamnsteam: @Sollice working overtime on release day LUL
[5:29:33] biirrd: @TeritoTV That is the exact definition of p2w.
[5:29:33] KragnosWoW: are there classes in lost ark
[5:29:38] 3663Sharad: @HaxzorJimDuggan outplayed LUL
[5:29:38] TheGaoSora: don't forget to ban Isometric ARPG KEKW
[5:29:49] ThisIzD: I think most people doing the p2w crap havent actually played the game or even looked at how it works. They are just parroting something they read on reddit
[5:29:50] rLeo2: Im so excited for lost ark
[5:29:53] riotinprogress: are they going to have male assassins at some point
[5:29:54] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || NEW BLIZZARD GAME ANNOUNCED!! THE NEXT BIG FRANCHISE?? youtu.be/X28RheebZ3M

[5:30:22] WhSkY405: !YT
[5:30:24] Sollice: We will literally ban anyone variation you we see. And I see the same person trying to say the same thing multiple ways to get around it, your going to get the boot too
[5:30:33] khemikale: destroyer mains in shambles
[5:30:36] khemikale: Sadge
[5:30:39] Gingerprimer: The only bad thing with boosting is the advertising in groupfinder otherwise it is not a prooblem
[5:30:52] ThisIzD: im not sure what to play. I did soulfist in beta and i can tell it has a huge skill ceiling.
[5:30:55] gelimarr: when does Lost Ark comes out?
[5:30:57] khemikale: nah dude, i want destroyer so bad too
[5:31:00] Sollice: Yeah what happened to Destroyers I was going to play one
[5:31:03] TeritoTV: @biirrd like I said then every multiplayer game ever falls under that category, so you can cast the net that wide if you want to but then what have you proven lol
[5:31:03] Ninjatun4: what are you going to play at launch?
[5:31:04] khemikale: it was my fav in RU
[5:31:13] Phantomstrk: you can create the "best" class in the game, but if you can't play it, then it doesn't matter
[5:31:21] Savagedave: hi towel man
[5:31:22] gelimarr: when is the launch
[5:31:25] 3663Sharad: Solice with the BOP  SeemsGood
[5:31:26] Auradus: no he meant it in a sad way @Towelliee about the destroyer mains in shambles like they are sad and destraught because no class at launch
[5:31:34] pacificmc1: towellie did you see the Dragonmire leak
[5:31:35] enceo9: zerker all the way baby
[5:31:38] slipkorn200: when lost ark releases?
[5:31:40] Phalamore: I think @Towelliee is a gunlancer main
[5:31:41] Alienfromger: paladin is support like bard
[5:31:47] Lennarxus: Lennarxus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[5:31:53] gelimarr: Why does Google says 19 dec 2019
[5:31:56] Sollice: 2/8 Early Access 2/11 full launch
[5:32:11] gelimarr: 8 feb
[5:32:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Gemmeke that was probably russian release
[5:32:43] gelimarr: Is Lost ark a Russian game?
[5:32:48] ralecgos: Do you mean Gunbreaker?? Or are you talking about Lost Ark?
[5:32:48] Raaeni: korean
[5:32:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: no it started in korea
[5:33:04] Moronil: no priest in Lost Ark BibleThump
[5:33:09] Alienfromger: Gunlancer LUL
[5:33:31] TheGaoSora: good :)
[5:33:32] gelimarr: Don't you mean Gunner
[5:33:33] rLeo2: Lets hope they learned from the New World pvp
[5:33:40] N3llee: @Towelliee  this is a good video going over recent Lost Ark Blog post of changes for NA. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm1fkKHEmRk
[5:33:52] ZakuzaGB: it looks fun but im sure if the top down view will last for me in pvp
[5:33:57] MMOrpgPrincess: So, it looks like the only 'healers' or 'buffers' are the mage and the pally?
[5:34:00] Armdel: @rleo2 Lost ark is older than new world
[5:34:00] gelimarr: Shadowhunter looks sick
[5:34:02] TheGaoSora: *muscle memory KEKWDISCO
[5:34:06] HbcMomo: what chair do you use?
[5:34:25] fat_european0: @Towelliee Do you think we'll get a new class?
[5:34:26] ejectdic: what are we smoking
[5:34:27] Poriand: @MMOrpgPrincess bard
[5:34:32] Wheeellz: hopefully madness berserker is in on na launch
[5:34:39] Auradus: i dont know about amazon servers i played new world from launch and damn those servers were definetly made in china
[5:34:41] TheCliffyShow: I thought Jeff Bezos made them both.
[5:34:44] lithium364: im hyped for lost ark but the class i wanna play is sadly not yet in the western release sadge
[5:34:44] MMOrpgPrincess: yes!!
[5:34:47] ralecgos: The Korthia story line is so tedious to do on alts. The part where you kill elites with Thrall and Draka is mind-numbing.
[5:34:47] TheGaoSora: Herman Miller Kreygasm
[5:34:47] theDirtyon3: need that team liquid secret labs chair
[5:35:07] CGd0c: lost ark is the shit
[5:35:12] fat_european0: only 10 times more, not a big deal Kappa
[5:35:20] Auradus: yeah but in New world 50 on 50 wars lagged so hard for everyone
[5:35:20] bioreducto: so in other words new world sucks
[5:35:21] goblinknows: need tormentors @Towelliee ? up on my server alliance wm off
[5:35:22] MMOrpgPrincess: I played a Korean created MMO for over fifteen years: Ragnarok
[5:35:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want to get the secret labs desk one day
[5:35:49] HbcMomo: I was thinking of getting a secret labs chair of the cloth version.  My brother in law has the leatherette one but i feel like it's too stiff
[5:36:19] Blah206: Has anyone played Mortal Online 2 ?
[5:36:22] ThisIzD: Stoopz has been killing it with LA streams lately.
[5:36:23] Sollice: I dont know about that. Western or English speaking people playing LA so far has been pretty niche
[5:36:26] AlphasaurusRexx: @HbcMomo my wife and i have both and they feeel th same
[5:36:27] goblinknows: need tormentors @Towelliee ? up on my server alliance wm off.
[5:36:30] TheGaoSora: Maybe you'd get cultists like in XIV who keep rewatching the story when a streamer picks it up LUL
[5:36:35] Sollice: I think its still going to feel pretty fresh
[5:36:43] AlphasaurusRexx: @HbcMomo i would go cloththough. the leather is meh quality
[5:36:44] Shaele: Free to play game, yet the 100 USD supporter pack is at the top 10 in steam charts :D @Towelliee
[5:37:07] MMOrpgPrincess: @Shaele I guess they want that mount ; )
[5:37:19] Wrizzik: wait. So they *found* the ark already?
[5:37:24] Draco_wolfstein: some people enjoy to spend money and that is there choice
[5:37:25] Armdel: I believe its more like wow where its end game focused
[5:37:25] Chigginators: Chigginators subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! towHi
[5:37:36] reggiepowa: same as wow to 60
[5:37:37] rhemak: cap is now 60 at launch
[5:37:39] TheGaoSora: NODDERS
[5:37:55] HbcMomo: @HbcMomo Bummer about feeling the same.  I've never liked leather chairs to begin with.  I might as well try out the chair and return it if i don't like it
[5:38:08] Alienfromger: levelcap is 60 at launch
[5:38:25] Draco_wolfstein: how long do think the story is
[5:38:42] Armdel: i died like 3 times fighting some world boss/rare on the beta
[5:38:50] ThisIzD: @wixiii_ its all about the game play man. combat is amazing.
[5:39:15] jeffnsteff2019: lookin at classes i am going play a assisan shadowhunter
[5:39:28] Draco_wolfstein: it has smooth combat
[5:39:54] ralecgos: Which Torghast wing is the easiest again? Upper Reaches right?

[5:40:54] TheGaoSora: @MMOrpgPrincess RO came out like 2-3 years before vanilla wow I think
[5:40:57] Draco_wolfstein: lost ark has that fast paced combat
[5:41:04] MMOrpgPrincess: The beta ya!!
[5:41:08] MMOrpgPrincess: You are right!
[5:41:18] jeffnsteff2019: u can do gunlancer as a warrior

[5:41:34] Basedd_god: is there healers
[5:41:39] TheGaoSora: oof lol
[5:41:57] laito_: wow has the best combat out of all mmos but sadly it lacks good class design, I hope it gets improved next xpac
[5:42:05] MMOrpgPrincess: I still have my original RO account from way back then.
[5:42:06] Vivelli: there is support, but not healers as you think of them from WoW. They do heal but u dont rely on those classes to survive like u do in WoW @Basedd_god
[5:42:19] Basedd_god: @Vivelli oh cool ty
[5:42:27] Th3Hammer: Act 2 Diablo music yesss

[5:45:04] jeffnsteff2019: eso is more a casual take it at your pace flex mmo
[5:45:23] N7Spectr3: They did put out a short 1:15 SWTOR teaser an hour ago.
[5:45:36] illistplays: eso pvp is trash tho
[5:45:42] illistplays: laggy af
[5:46:09] JaseLeland: the combat turns a lot of people off
[5:46:10] Basedd_god: eso squadSleeper
[5:46:14] illistplays: Cyro is a lag fest lol
[5:46:17] Draco_wolfstein: its not as fluid as new rold
[5:46:17] KragnosWoW: I enjoyed blade and soul combat
[5:46:19] Draco_wolfstein: world
[5:46:38] illistplays: Rip
[5:46:43] ILikeKillTheZombies: i have more fun in skyrim when it comes to combat with 1 mod than ESO
[5:46:46] H0bbitK1ng: what is on your head
[5:47:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not a huge fan of their weapon swapping system....I think it works better on console with controller than it does for PC
[5:47:04] Rowwek: you have to do something called combat weaving in order to do top dps, and it's just not fun. at least it's not to me
[5:47:07] illistplays: i am 1800 cp in eso
[5:47:14] manhooties: When playing eso, I never felt like my character was getting stronger, it kinda sucked while leveling, everythign felt same difficulty, maybe im just ass at the game, but it felt weird
[5:47:15] Yagr6: eso does world content right tho wth the delves and world bosses
[5:47:16] illistplays: i live in cyro but fuck the lag Xd
[5:47:20] KragnosWoW: i love how he pronounces naruto LUL

[5:47:43] illistplays: still in 2012 lol?
[5:48:01] jarilrpg: also the ESO gear doesnt progress, been in BIS slot gear for 3ish years
[5:48:05] Armdel: Crunchyroll sponsorship around the corner
[5:48:16] theDirtyon3: the pve is very easy in ESO compared to any other MMO
[5:48:35] Drogdorf: true. all streams are PVP
[5:48:47] BoezIRL: thee's raid?
[5:48:47] jeffnsteff2019: bring back wildstar mmo gods
[5:48:49] zeitgeiz: All I ever see is people going around collecting things for points or pvping
[5:48:50] n4i8: theres 1 new raid per year, 3 bosses + hm thats it
[5:49:08] dalaraz: @moonshadows83 as far as i love wildstar,it would die in 3 months
[5:49:09] Mikeysmiff: I do like that all content is relevant in ESO though
[5:49:25] Misfit_23: but all raids in the game are relevant
[5:49:28] Rowwek: they care more about solo trials than they do raids
[5:49:32] antori_92: do we have a data on 9.2
[5:49:43] jarilrpg: story and collecting is more important in ESO than endgame
[5:49:49] TheCliffyShow: ESO has a very open class system just like the single player games.
[5:50:01] zodd_amhai: i like GW2 exploring more
[5:50:02] Maydie6066: @Towelliee putting your pally main aside. for 9.2 do you think Prot Pally or DK would be a stronger pair with a warrior for Mythic Prog?
[5:50:09] KragnosWoW: arrow in the knee
[5:50:14] Salfurium: ESO also needs challenging PVE. Like mythic+
[5:50:22] Yagr6: elder scrolls 6 tho PogChamp
[5:50:32] zeitgeiz: Feels more like a single player rpg than an mmo
[5:50:36] Snabido: ES6 in like 10 years Keepo
[5:51:09] Rowwek: the only thing I really liked in ESO is the crafting, pve was a joke in terms of difficulty
[5:51:24] jeffnsteff2019: eq2 has crap load of content too
[5:51:24] whiiie: i mean the same can be said about ff tho? its more of a story game than anything else, it just happens to have decent pve content?  the pvp is basiclly dead lol
[5:51:27] Armdel: ES6 will save gaming
[5:51:29] Snabido: How many expansions is eso up to now
[5:51:40] TheCliffyShow: I got the Sarge mount. And, Hearthstone's kinda fun.

[6:31:36] Jarlan23: it might. i think a lot of more casual fans will play elden ring
[6:31:37] NickLeonhearth: Elden ring will double lost ark's day numbers, guaranteed

[6:36:31] CrunkyBrewster: i always enjoyed towelliee pvp
[6:36:52] ILikeKillTheZombies: playing the big guy and everyone hated you back then
[6:37:00] ILikeKillTheZombies: for biggest hitbox :D
[6:37:11] TheCliffyShow: Ovewatch Lunar event is now but no PvE with it.
[6:37:18] balancedlight: So literally the best mode they could ever make for leveling and a way to learn and enjoy pvp is only for lvl 60.
[6:37:29] mmrghost7: which tanks do u think will be S tear on 9.2 ?

[6:39:08] Todmeister9000: was titan supposed to be mmo?
[6:39:16] Sam_Nash: man I loved the old school talent tree in wow
[6:39:22] Jarlan23: i think ow2 got delayed because they decided to do 5v5 later in development
[6:39:25] IianaDRK: jeff leaving wouldve hit them hard
[6:39:31] Jarlan23: and they had to rebalance or rework each hero
[6:39:36] garnfolf: @ILikeKillTheZombies no they said why on twitter, bobby was making them do projects for overwatch 1 that kept getting scraped
[6:39:40] Heero_Effect: Hehehe
[6:39:51] balancedlight: as soon as im not broke anymore i'm gonna resub
[6:39:54] Mecabeast: it made Bobby sell to Microsoft kekw
[6:40:34] camatronian: easiest to get renown is lvl 5 Torgast
[6:40:39] balanira: because the BG end screen covers the place which tells you u got renown LUL
[6:40:43] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee it tells you but the score board blocks the animation in the middle of the screen telling you the renown is increased

[6:42:41] flappyurf: hate to say but OW2 is just an addon to OW :D
[6:42:43] IianaDRK: ow2 is just a glorified expansion pack. its not worth a whole sequel

[7:04:15] KragnosWoW: betty white was supposed to be azeroth....
[7:04:55] Heero_Effect: Towelie should play someone in the WoW movie
[7:05:40] Joneeeez: why would zooval try to kill Azeroth, does he gain some sick power from that, than he is not gone in the next expansion, no way, that would make no sense
[7:06:27] Templexx: Esteemed Pennant is at lvl 90
[7:06:43] ralecgos: Why does it seem like Ion has disappeared ?
[7:06:53] TheCliffyShow: Maybe, with another expansion then can actually make Jailer an interesting character.
[7:07:12] vimie: There must always be... A Jailer. *Pan to Sylvanas*
[7:07:12] havenbirch: Think the Jailer may take on the form of the concept at that was leaked by Pyromancer?

[7:08:20] garnfolf: that looks like the primus
[7:08:33] TheUnknowing: thats like jailer primus fusion lol
[7:08:34] lithium364: the old design looked so much better gives me hades wibes
[7:08:34] 3663Sharad: He looks very much like the Primus
[7:08:38] Todmeister9000: maybe this was what he looked like as the Arbiter
[7:08:39] balancedlight: It looks more like the Primus now than anything
[7:08:49] 3663Sharad: Maybe thats why they changed his style
[7:08:50] Snabido: Doubtfully he'll ditch his new gear already. Although it would be similar to when we players get new gear, patch to patch 😏
[7:08:51] TheCliffyShow: There's also that broken down Jailer "prototype".
[7:08:52] Draco_wolfstein: the jailer was trying to summon chuck norris
[7:08:53] piratechris: He's the Primus brother isn't he?
[7:09:02] mavericks312: and becomes the prime jailer
[7:09:03] BoezIRL: yeah they changed it for the primus
[7:09:08] RunklePunch: jails syl

[7:09:16] atowellthatiallreadyused: Optimus prime
[7:09:27] ralecgos: I wish they made the Jailer more like the Emperor from Star Wars and less like Thanos. I feel like a death character would be more fragile or something?
[7:09:52] KragnosWoW: the primus is the jailer and the jailer is the primus and we are all neo from the matrix POGGERS
[7:10:01] balancedlight: the jailor is just his soul bound creation
[7:10:01] cinnamints: I've always thought the Primus was behind all this, he's just really well-positioned to get away with it.
[7:10:07] lithium364: plottwist the first ones are Amon from starcraft
[7:10:37] omegamer562: are you going to be playing lost ark?

[7:11:23] Winpimplaren: What if Sargeras *was* trying to save the universe for big bad eventually evil corrupted Azeroth?
[7:11:25] onybear: The jailer is nazoth….it is all an illusion
[7:11:32] garnfolf: maybe he wants to infuse himself with Azeroth
[7:11:38] TheCliffyShow: I honestly, don't care anymore. Jailer has been such a bad villian.
[7:11:45] verkz_: When do you think 9.2 will be @Towelliee ?
[7:11:48] garnfolf: @onybear i mean honestly... not false
[7:12:02] lithium364: shouldnt our character and thrall jaina etc be mind wiped after sl is over? seems kinda crazy coming back to the world and KNOWING what the afterlife is about

[7:16:26] Heero_Effect: I hope the jailer wins I want to lose and have the next one be about rebuilding
[7:16:36] queeflabs: inb4 they make azeroth look like therazane the stone mother and the rule34 goes south
[7:16:38] ralecgos: Amanthul yes
[7:16:38] Dreadfrost: argus was aliive and the planet was still intact right?
[7:16:48] Nightshaft25: Nightshaft25 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months!

[7:16:50] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[7:17:06] Joneeeez: It says that Azeroth is a nascent titan wth does that mean?
[7:17:08] havenbirch: Well Argus did not break when titan Argus was born as far as I know
[7:17:11] balanira: wait wasnt the sundering caused by queen azshara and sargeras ?
[7:17:13] Dreadfrost: Argus was active and the planet was still intact right?
[7:17:15] SonofHorus82: Well of Eternity caused the sundering.
[7:17:34] Lynxide: Thats basically the Eternals plot if she destroy the planet xD
[7:17:35] balancedlight: In fact the other Titans still have ther own planets
[7:17:36] TheUnknowing: argus land masses were separated lol
[7:17:36] Chronine: @Joneeeez like a young titan
[7:17:38] havenbirch: Looked more like legion corrupting it
[7:17:41] Clay2K_: @Towelliee I thought the sundering was from the well of eternity shit?
[7:17:41] 3663Sharad: Argus could be torn apart cause of the Legions fel magic
[7:18:00] Dreadfrost: yes
[7:18:01] Snabido: It caused the Well of Eternity
[7:18:04] Dreadfrost: it created the maelstrom
[7:18:09] 3663Sharad: its in the first book of chronicles
[7:18:12] Slippy8908: @Towelliee king of addons. do you know a good addon to use to get loremaster for every expansion?
[7:18:45] fistofnature: @slippy8908 some people use "all the things" to track achivement
[7:19:02] ralecgos: I don't like the idea that Warcraft planets are like literally eggs that literally HATCH for world souls... I hope they figure out something more creative than that.
[7:19:10] Winpimplaren: He just yoinked that leech out.
[7:19:19] TheCliffyShow: I think Y'Shajaar is gonna come back someway. Maybe, get ressurected by some cosmic power out in space.
[7:19:42] Xsilentghost: no way slyvanas dies because she gets her own book right which is her story after 9.2
[7:19:43] lithium364: i really hope they dont copy eternals and we have to put azeroth back to sleep or some crap

[7:20:04] mmo_kenna_: Sargeras literally hid inside Aegwynn's womb until he was reborn into Medivh. He was dark
[7:20:06] TheCliffyShow: Sounds interesting to me.
[7:20:07] xmedpakx: kinda like the eternals movie?
[7:20:11] xmedpakx: heh
[7:20:24] balancedlight: Even Sargeras has his own planet
[7:20:52] Autoexeq: Do you have all PvP transmogg sets on Towelliee?

[7:21:36] Templexx: wen do we go to the back side of azeroth
[7:21:37] Streamcrush: Draenor didn't have a world soul, if I recall right

[7:24:25] ralecgos: Yeah the void lords like peppered them through the physical universe
[7:24:54] TheCliffyShow: It's like Cylons of Battestar Galactia. Need a story twist, make another old god.
[7:25:03] ralecgos: She possessed the body of a blood elf i think. It was dope
[7:25:30] Joneeeez: dosent Xalath has connection to the void lords?
[7:25:48] ashwing_: there was an old god even in BC in Terrokar questline
[7:25:50] GivTater: imma have to twit longer the idea floating around in my head.
[7:25:54] atowellthatiallreadyused: I think dragon isles is gonna be west of kalimdor ish back side of azeroth
[7:26:06] JohnnyRain: streak juice it up

[7:26:14] gidgeet: whatcha doing
[7:26:16] Melonbrew: how much honor are you getting per win?
[7:26:33] balancedlight: We were never given a definitive number of how many old gods there are just the names of the ones that have interacted with Azeroth.
[7:26:48] atowellthatiallreadyused: i know but it makes it feel more adventure
[7:26:51] Mecabeast: so between Gilneas and broken shore?
[7:26:52] Snabido: I was under impression like between eastern northrend and northern lordaeron ish, but it can change
[7:27:13] TheCliffyShow: That sounds epic.
[7:27:21] Snabido: Bring the Vindicar skybox to dragon isles PogChamp

[7:27:59] Asyia3: west of silvermoon  north of undercity is where the isles supposed to be I believe
[7:28:08] Snabido: Heroic Leap says yes you can Kappa
[7:28:31] ralecgos: Who needs kneecaps anyway
[7:28:39] luckfore: im gonna lmao when 10.0 isnt dragon related at all
[7:28:42] maccaruso: There is no pog only Zul
[7:28:46] atowellthatiallreadyused: my only argument why it isnt norh of eastern kingdoms is that then lore wise they couldve allready explored the isles long time ago thats why i i think it back side of azeroth makes more sense
[7:29:03] balanira: well technically you heroic leap when u enter/exit warrior order hall
[7:29:41] havenbirch: They could also add Tel Abim and Plunder Isle who knows
[7:29:53] helheimr: they had the broken isles in the lore but not in game for a long time
[7:30:11] S1appadabass: people are really sleeping on 10.0 World of Warcraft: The Noid

[7:32:27] atowellthatiallreadyused: green dragon aspect
[7:32:27] maccaruso: Void lords over here kill stealing
[7:32:27] TheCliffyShow: Something dealing with the green dragonflight.
[7:32:30] Crypticedge: The Dragons Pog
[7:32:47] strchsr: @Towelliee Every time someone says dragons I can't help but hear that one NPC in ESO who says "Dragons! Here, in our own homeland!"
[7:33:01] Joneeeez: can the dragons somehow heal Azeroth or what power does they have?
[7:33:05] Rudric_Ice: LETS just go back to killing pigs in elwynn forest
[7:33:05] Dreadfrost: Il'gonoth fucking Oracle
[7:33:09] Crypticedge: literally the jailer is impregnating azeroth with his domination seeds
[7:33:13] IianaDRK: jailer playing 5d chess, nzoth playing 6d chess
[7:33:18] 3663Sharad: Azeroth screams, Void comes in... AU Yrel risps the dark portal open again and we have the ultiamte clash of Light vs Void on Azeroth
[7:33:32] rizuel23: hogger teams up with the jailer and they kill azeroth
[7:33:35] sorrin143: i think Sintharia still alive @Towelliee
[7:33:37] Mecabeast: I mean in some Lovecraft lore when azeroth wakes up all existence ends which could be a route but unlikely
[7:33:47] geokouts: All out attack from former enemies of us and the Dragon helping us
[7:33:49] killercondon: Guldans coming back for round 3
[7:33:52] ralecgos: I still think the whole "Child of Light and Void" thing is going to come up later. And I still think it will be Arator. Alleria and Turalyon's son.
[7:34:13] Crypticedge: you honor farming or lvling?
[7:34:24] TheCliffyShow: I just want some dragon stuff.
[7:34:37] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee well N'Zoth and Azshara worked together kinda. Syvlanas and Azshara had some kind of bargain... so its possible N'Zoth is involved
[7:34:43] ralecgos: Light and Shadow rather

[7:35:59] willsowavy: Superstrain
[7:36:03] gking3000: superstrain for general, if you want m+ then crimson rune weapon
[7:36:04] balanira: @Towelliee superstrain is by far the best dps wise and it drops by SLG
[7:36:08] Froudini: crimson rune weapon interacts with blood tier set in 9.2
[7:36:13] willsowavy: You get it from castle nathria
[7:36:16] Autoexeq: Stone Legion
[7:36:18] strchsr: Stone Legion Generals

[7:36:34] bgriff87: LFR TIME!
[7:36:38] Slippy8908: @Towelliee put it on neck
[7:36:39] cahoots82: You can just buy the thing to get it?

[7:36:46] silentmrfox: @Towelliee you can buy the item from the archavist
[7:36:48] Clay2K_: Sell the old one

[7:36:52] Clay2K_: get it refunded
[7:36:53] j_hooligan: Lfr stone legion let’s gooooo
[7:37:01] bgriff87: 235 version will cost like 5700 I think
[7:37:02] Zoitack: 50% of the time it drops errrytiimee Kappa
[7:37:03] smashwow: or you can farm archivist knowledge @Towelliee for the memories
[7:37:06] Zee_97: u an mail over soul ash
[7:37:06] sweckz: you need 5160 soul ash and 1650 cinders for max leggo
[7:37:08] silentmrfox: @Towelliee if you buy the item the archivist sells in korthia it drops memories you dont have
[7:37:14] havenbirch: I just hope to see Khadgar in 10.0
[7:37:17] Mecabeast: put it on the best slot for 9.2 not 9.1 but idk which slot is best

[7:37:30] bgriff87: no
[7:37:30] sweckz: no
[7:37:30] ralecgos: No not cinders
[7:37:31] Froudini: why waste it on a legendary that's gonna be obsolete in 9.2? Every BDK is gonna run Crimson Rune weapon when they get their tier set.
[7:37:37] balanira: i dont think so
[7:37:38] xFevers: No
[7:37:39] smashwow: ash not cinders
[7:37:45] cahoots82: any non-tier set piece, yeah
[7:37:46] smashwow: for whatever the fucking reason
[7:37:49] xFevers: you need 1650 cinders for 262
[7:37:50] cahoots82: back
[7:37:54] Niksen_99: Will you be killing Illidan tonight on classic or dont care? :D
[7:37:56] IianaDRK: think neck is still bis for superstrain in 9.2
[7:37:56] xFevers: You can spam layer 9 for them though
[7:37:57] bgriff87: Superstrain is neck or chest
[7:38:02] ralecgos: You lose a little soul ash when you convert it to mail it
[7:38:10] tebbix: catJAM
[7:38:15] xFevers: Yea
[7:38:18] Slippy8908: @Towelliee grind level 9 torgy and you get 1 renown for each run and ash and cinder
[7:38:23] sweckz: yeah farm level 9 torg
[7:38:27] im_n0t_jezus: im doing this EXACT thing now farming cinder for the superstrain LOL
[7:38:28] Odd3ty: Yes
[7:38:28] cahoots82: Yep. Torghast is only cinders source atm. Outside of small weekly things.
[7:38:39] willsowavy: Yup ir sucks
[7:38:41] Slippy8908: @Towelliee oooh streamer rng bad
[7:38:49] bgriff87: good ol borghast
[7:38:56] Froudini: yeah when you get to 55+ renown it seems to stop being 100%
[7:39:09] mitchumtx: You going to get your S2 Elite Set Towelliee?
[7:39:14] strchsr: @Towelliee I've went from 70-80 renown on my priest in Comp Stomp and 40-55 on a different covenant and I'm almost exalted with the reputation and a fully upgraded honor set lol
[7:39:16] Niksen_99: Chat do you know if Towel is raiding black temple on classic tonight? :D
[7:39:16] smashwow: also got some clickbait gfuel. is it really going to taste like smarties?
[7:39:20] balanira: transmog run
[7:39:33] TheCliffyShow: What difficulty?
[7:39:34] Snabido: Do mythic for the hell of it 😏
[7:39:37] Draysor: took me 20ish minutes to get into slg lfr yesterday on my bdk
[7:39:39] Ivan_all_Good: i queued with a healer yesterday for it. Took like 15 minutes
[7:39:47] DatSheppy: I thought it was your fav xpac?
[7:40:04] TheCliffyShow: I think there's still a few transmogs I could get.
[7:40:06] DatSheppy: ahh bummer
[7:40:06] Ottay: @Towelliee what is the name of the boosting service you are using for your raid tomorrow?
[7:40:07] strchsr: It's 100% for every memory now if you don't have it as of 9.1.5 iirc
[7:40:08] mitchumtx: thought legendaries are 100% drop rate now?
[7:40:16] c3llout7: who u raiding with in 9.2?
[7:40:24] c3llout7: you going hard in mythic?
[7:40:26] strchsr: But they were always 100% in raid and Torghast but not in dungeons ye
[7:40:27] fluh_: but wouldnt you want the rune weapon lego for 9.2 instead of the out of date one from slg?
[7:40:32] smashwow: @mitchum69 for raids only has been that way since launch
[7:40:34] doomester: slugefist
[7:40:36] strchsr: Shriekwing, Sludgefist, SLG
[7:40:36] Draysor: shriekwing > sludge > slg
[7:40:37] Slippy8908: @Towelliee 1st boss slug then stone
[7:40:43] IianaDRK: shriek > sludge > SLG
[7:40:44] Aromantis: ham it up
[7:40:50] Froudini: I doubt there is any scenario where you'd run Superstrain over Crimson Rune Weapon in 9.2. Tier set + CrW leggo is just bonkers
[7:40:51] smashwow: shriek, sludge
[7:41:06] smashwow: lol you mihgt
[7:41:11] Niksen_99: So rare to see Towel pvp :D

[7:41:32] theDirtyon3: this isnt pvp guys lol its comp stomp
[7:41:34] feherlofia123: towellie pvp pog
[7:41:40] feherlofia123: huh
[7:41:44] Snabido: "Pvp"
[7:41:48] Snabido: 👀
[7:41:51] balanira: @Froudini u do in raids since there is downtime in taking dmg
[7:41:59] Draysor: hows comp stomp on bdk?
[7:42:12] theDirtyon3: comp stomp on anything is easy
[7:42:18] bgriff87: When does the ESO announcement start?
[7:42:21] strchsr: @Towelliee What's the priority for buying conquest items, trinkets/accessories first?
[7:42:27] Crypticedge: EZ
[7:42:36] Brodih_: you stomp on any character
[7:43:06] strchsr: Mythic Comp Stomp when
[7:43:10] classictwo: Yes i do know what you are saying
[7:43:10] Snabido: Its for the pve'ers who want to pvp Kappa
[7:43:20] Jungestson: Wonder if it was made as a way to get Defilers reputation fairly easily for casual gamres
[7:43:31] IianaDRK: KEKW
[7:43:32] theDirtyon3: LUL
[7:43:33] itscityboy: KEKW
[7:43:35] KragnosWoW: sap capped by AI
[7:43:36] Froudini: @balanira are there really that many bosses where you take zero dmg when not actively tanking though? After they changed the proc to work from any damage, it increased the value of CrW leggo even more
[7:43:37] luckfore: KEKW
[7:43:41] bgriff87: KEKW
[7:43:54] luckfore: he was special :O
[7:43:59] 3663Sharad: Bot got controlled by a GM LUL
[7:44:02] bgriff87: towOof

[7:44:42] strchsr: @Towelliee You could also just make a 10 man group with someone who has the skip and just do it on Normal
[7:44:46] Cosmolus: that's 0.17 renown per comp stomp
[7:45:01] strchsr: I think it's 170?
[7:45:16] TheCliffyShow: That rules out my blood elf.
[7:45:18] Snabido: 184 was normal mythic in 9.0 if that helps
[7:45:26] Snabido: *mythic dung
[7:45:34] Mecabeast: I could of swore was 164
[7:45:40] balanira: @Froudini but u still need to take a lot of dmg to proc alot, im pretty sure as it stands right now its not worth the dps loss of superstrain if u have a lot of downtime according to blood dk discord. the CRW is bonkers in M+ though
[7:45:42] Snabido: As in drops
[7:46:05] ohnot___her: Save a spot just buying some 200 gear

[7:48:24] strchsr: I just have the base URL saved and I change out the realm/character name
[7:48:28] Froudini: @balanira yeah might be. On the other hand BDK brings pepega dps anyway slootKEKW If I had to craft 1 leggo though I'd go CrW first because it's stronger in more content and then do Superstrain as my "backup" for specific raid bosses
[7:49:07] Blah206: LUL
[7:49:19] ralecgos: Maybe they died Monkas
[7:49:26] Wise_Batman: do you like nutella spread on a sweet buns?
