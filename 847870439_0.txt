[0:02:56] Thyhorn: Good race though
[0:03:02] ZeethianDragon: TOW haircut today big Pog
[0:03:03] ManoDeDiablo: s
[0:03:05] ZeethianDragon: GG LIMIT
[0:03:06] Supers18: Echo moving to NA LULW
[0:03:06] xluckydawgx: BALD HAMMER LETSSSS GOOO
[0:03:23] LordKain73: üá∫üá∏ SUPREMACY üá∫üá∏
[0:03:57] theFirstAidKit: Typical NA people don't understand what a headstart is LUL
[0:04:17] Thyhorn: LUL NA is not making it any better by being Toxic
[0:04:21] Kneckt: typical EU people dont understand what catching up is LUL
[0:04:32] josh8555: lol
[0:04:34] palastiel: EU gets an extra day on the end of the week. ‚ÄúHead start‚Äù is a myth @thefirstaidkit
[0:04:44] Amphoric: Head start was killed by Generals bugs
[0:04:51] rustylock: they need to do a global release
[0:04:59] ZeethianDragon: @rustylock not happening
[0:05:09] Leemster30: let's get it!
[0:05:12] Kneckt: cant believe people get so salty about a guild losing world first, dosent effect ur life in the slightest LUL
[0:05:18] rustylock: would save moaning from both sides that way so....
[0:05:25] Sielu11628: Best part about RWF being over? I can watch Towelliee again!!!
[0:05:26] Daggerstry: GG to Limit. ROFL to Echo for losing revenue and face for not streaming Denathrius
[0:05:36] mavericks312: limits broadcast team told ppl to move to na servers if they think its unfair
[0:05:56] Gnuen: I'm EU, and an Echo "fan", but RWF has always been like this, i got a sour taste in my mouth over all the drama that people are causing :(
[0:05:58] Lilgigs: You can't claim headstart when limit was basically bug testing bosses and EU go tthat advantage when they were fixed. Echo lost. get over it
[0:05:59] mke_fc: oldorfus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:06:04] Amphoric: I mean Generals was the only overtuned fight but okay @trevybnasty
[0:06:09] josh8555: oh no its everywhere
[0:06:16] skymercii: people are trying to say "DBM withheld the information "to benefit" limit üôÑ
[0:06:17] theFirstAidKit: @mavericks312 Yeah, nothing like raiding WF with 150 ping LUL
[0:06:23] Amphoric: and it was artificial difficulty because of massive bugs
[0:06:29] Lilgigs: LImits tank is from EU
[0:06:31] Lilgigs: playing in the eu
[0:06:34] Lilgigs: soooooo
[0:06:45] Lycis: EU wins once again
[0:06:53] Amphoric: @trevybnasty sludgefist was broken because of the chain pull mechanic hitting multiple times
[0:06:55] Lilgigs: cant cliam ping is bad
[0:06:55] momomo_89: imagine if your defining moment in life wasnt even getting a world first in wow but ranting about it in twitch chat. KEKW
[0:07:06] GoGetItKo: KKona 7
[0:07:08] gunnieh: @trevybnasty head start first week doesnt matter much, the real head start is on reset week 2. All the bugs week one makes no difference when both guilds clearly needed reset to kill 10/10.
[0:07:10] DrBerit99: @Gnuen Me too, hate to see all the negative comments about eachother, it was a fun race and I don't know why everyone is so pissed off.
[0:07:16] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @trevybnasty (warning)
[0:07:23] theFirstAidKit: @Lilgigs Europe is a large continent, sure you get low ping if you live near west EU, not the same thing everywhere
[0:07:53] Averegeguy: So happy for Limit they deserve it
[0:08:07] Lilgigs: the US is larger than europe
[0:08:14] Lilgigs: soo
[0:08:18] raptorstrick: Thought Limit was NA
[0:08:26] Lilgigs: limit is na
[0:08:29] Lilgigs: but they have EU players
[0:08:31] Lycis: US is smaller by 270 million
[0:08:34] jkitchin75: thay are
[0:08:40] Lilgigs: MAP size not population
[0:08:43] Lilgigs: jesus
[0:08:45] Lilgigs: we arent tlaking people

[0:08:46] Coil_Twitch_Bot: cheer100

[0:09:09] palastiel: @lilgigs not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say
[0:09:12] josh8555: lol
[0:09:14] theFirstAidKit: @Lilgigs Because you are not replying or taggin people so most people think you are just talking to everyone
[0:09:46] Cynocles: @everyone pee pee poo poo
[0:09:47] Cynocles: :D
[0:09:50] Gravirtus: USA USA USA
[0:09:54] Lycis: Isn't Limit not NA well if the tank is from EU
[0:09:57] Thyhorn: I wish there would have been more guilds on the last boss
[0:10:09] GoGetItKo: i'm just excited to see towelliee's hair. he always wearin' a cap so never seen it
[0:10:11] Lycis: its a win win i guess
[0:10:30] Malarick: Head shaving stream tonight?
[0:10:37] Absynne: I just hope next tier goes atleast a day longer. If Echo was able to do splits I think the outcome would've been different
[0:10:54] KittyRhage: Best part of Limit winning is watching Max scream and jump
[0:10:58] Absynne: But Both guilds played amazingly
[0:11:08] eclipsion_haze: muhahahaha in the great words of Bruce Buffer...."IT'S TIIIIIME!"
[0:11:18] skymercii: @raptorstrick Limit is NA i was In Max's stream when they downed it
[0:11:23] josh8555: yea dude got hyped
[0:11:44] eclipsion_haze: i was in thd's stream shit was wild
[0:12:07] josh8555: real quick to spill his beans about getting messed up lmao
[0:12:15] Goatsguffle: Eu whining about the 16 lead. But Limit had 3 EU players on the kill, one of them being a tank so if they were really interested in a head to head they could do it. They want that crutch to fall on if they don't win
[0:12:28] Febreze1212: NA baby!!!!!!!!!
[0:13:03] KittyRhage: I think was really makes that 16 hour argument moot is all the times Method kicked NA ass

[0:13:07] Supers18: Echo moving to NA is LULW
[0:13:19] KittyRhage: what really*
[0:13:29] Lycis: That was good calculated from Blizzard to let the race end before christmas
[0:13:35] Noobicron: Gingi is a tool
[0:13:37] LordKain73: FBRun üá∫üá∏ FBBlock üá™üá∫ üí¶
[0:14:11] xeeeoN: i can understand that limits fans are really happy but saying a 16h gear advantage on week 2 is not a big deal is just stupid...
[0:14:44] Lycis: that's almost a day lol
[0:15:18] Thyhorn: Can't wait for Method to get back in top 3 :)
[0:15:22] Absynne: yeah Limit got it down to 20ish% before they went and did splits whereas Echo was able to get it down to 3.9% without splits
[0:15:31] thor798: EU gets to watch NA slam into bugs first before Blizz fixes them; EU gets to watch NA strategies and see what works before they get to do it
[0:15:37] Thoreya: echo didnt get it to 3.9 without splits
[0:15:39] Thoreya: thats incorrect
[0:15:45] SlayerLightStorm: Yup. Called it. Limit wins.

[0:17:19] Moobot: it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 17:31 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon‚Ñ¢
[0:17:21] Lycis: Well I didn't expected NewMethod i mean Echo to be so close to Limit
[0:17:32] iunbearable: That dude looks like Sco from Method LUL
[0:17:34] Lycis: NA really struggles still
[0:17:47] SlayerLightStorm: towHAMUP towRekt towByah
[0:17:53] LordKain73: Struggles to winning? lolololl
[0:17:57] Supers18: Why is Scipre such a sore loser - just give limit their props - even in nyalotha he was saying they got out mettad and now he is making more excuses
[0:18:14] ssjw1337: The guy on the screen is sco
[0:18:18] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[0:18:19] Waspire: i just got home from work ... so limiit won huh....
[0:18:20] Absynne: Yeah both Limit and Echo got to do splits before Denathrius but Limit was able to do splits after this reset where Echo wasn't able to
[0:18:21] Fl4rp: Fl4rp is continuing the Gift Sub they got from RetiredNavyVet! 
[0:18:24] Supers18: completely disrespecting the players in limit
[0:18:24] Lycis: Yea Echo was super close to winning after split up an entire org
[0:18:26] nitemare34godd: they should tell limit u guys did a hell of a job
[0:18:36] Thyhorn: why are people so butt hurt, Well Played that's it LUL
[0:18:39] nitemare34godd: instead they or he says this stuff
[0:18:47] LordKain73: @Lycis But they didn't sooooo.....
[0:18:51] Lycis: Yep, well
[0:18:54] talic420: Echo did some splits but not as many as they wouold of liked to
[0:18:55] ssjw1337: Imagine being happy your team won and not shitting on the other team at the same time
[0:18:56] Lycis: pkayed
[0:18:56] mavericks312: didnt echo recruit like a 3rd of old method?

[0:19:59] mavericks312: i almost wanted new method to place higher then echo

[0:20:31] Lycis: That's what i mean, still well played while still rebuilding
[0:20:33] KittyRhage: New Method is doing much better than anyone figured
[0:20:38] TheCliffyShow: Well, it's the first raid of the expansion.
[0:20:44] talic420: what a good race
[0:20:50] SlayerLightStorm: @thecliffyshow Yup. LiMiT wins.
[0:20:54] avallach422: !uptime

[0:21:29] Thyhorn: New Method will be in top 3 next Tier

[0:21:59] raptorstrick: It‚Äôs a global release. EU has nothing to complain about
[0:22:00] bonnzo79: as long as its not his ball sack lol
[0:22:18] Absynne: If next tier is like a 2 week tier or longer I'm thinking Echo will win

[0:23:00] TheCliffyShow: @raptorstrick The expansion was global. The release of the raid I think was based on reset which put EU a little behind.
[0:23:06] LadyJasmin: Thanks for the 2020Shhh @misterelectric
[0:23:11] Thyhorn: @mavericks312 looking at their progress I wasn't even expecting top 10 in this tier
[0:23:16] SlayerLightStorm: I didn't watch any of the races. Been watching Discord for news.
[0:23:21] fooxytv: Seeing limit play is going to take a lot to beat
[0:23:25] Lycis: EU was 9 hours behind and that just thanks to Blizz
[0:23:48] ThatW0lF: hug
[0:23:50] Tigerklaue: na had better server Kappa

[0:26:06] fooxytv: @masumii3 lol true, it‚Äôs amazing watching him play he‚Äôs definitely one of the bests players in WoW can play anything and at any level
[0:26:08] Lycis: Let NA have their win once again. Echo will be back and stronger
[0:26:09] rosina_scarlett: @yahboyastro Scripe kept saying limit stole strats from them the whole race LUL
[0:26:23] rosina_scarlett: @Fooxytv hes def the best ww monk in existance
[0:26:53] Tigerklaue: i dont get why people fight over it who cares in 2-3 weeks who won this race
[0:27:00] Arbszy: I swear if anyone brings in that 16h BS. Were gunna have a problem.
[0:27:06] Absynne: Yeah thats what I'm saying. Scripe says Limit is stealing strats. Limit is saying Echo is stealing strats. It goes both ways
[0:27:09] fooxytv: Totally agree with that üëç

[0:28:10] Arbszy: Both guilds were great!

[0:28:23] Lycis: Ask Towelliee what he can accomplish in 16 hours than you know LUL
[0:28:28] bad_fish_too: Why is EU crying about the 16h thing now but not when they were winning previous races. hmmm
[0:28:29] Arbszy: Roger is a great strategist.
[0:28:33] Collected1: holy shit that THDLOCK reaction video. hahahahaha.

[0:28:46] Tigerklaue: can you link the video?
[0:28:49] Thyhorn: OMG, can't even joke on this channel
[0:28:56] Arbszy: I feel if he played the 21st member that would be a hard to compete with.
[0:29:04] SlayerLightStorm: Saw LiMiT's reaction when they killed him. Epic AF.
[0:29:14] Arbszy: THDlock vid was so wholesome
[0:29:16] Absynne: Cause usually the end raid boss dying on reset day doesnt happen
[0:29:23] ssjw1337: finally echo killed him
[0:29:25] rosina_scarlett: @Arbszy I Completely agree. he'd do better then script tbh
[0:29:28] rosina_scarlett: scripe*
[0:29:40] Lycis: Aversion was great, doubt anyone had them on the screen. The Germanz comin!
[0:29:46] Arbszy: Scripe is a good player and the poor just looked stressed.

[0:30:06] rosina_scarlett: hes to used to being in the fights and not looking in the outside

[1:39:33] jokkzie: It would have been awesome to have the world first in lan event
[1:39:38] Kruell13: @Towelliee did you switch covenants?
[1:39:40] Aervyper: @Towelliee it would be such a disadvantage they would be so far behind in the support
[1:39:49] garkhyt: given that limit gaming room is like a command center
[1:39:53] Luthercorpz: It was the best live race to date
[1:40:13] pereadin: Why the kyrian change?
[1:40:13] Luthercorpz: Day before X mas both raids running the last boss 4%. Shit was fire

[1:40:52] WeaponII: I was hoping at best they'd finish tomorrow
[1:40:57] Supers18: Towelliee u said it they saved xmas haha
[1:40:59] WeaponII: worst*
[1:41:01] Abbz44: Shit i'm excited it lasted as long as it did, and that the last 3 bosses took longer than the other 7 bosses for all guilds
[1:41:04] rosina_scarlett: method is doing really well after there rebuild
[1:41:23] hardcorl: in austria we have lockdown makes no difference

[1:41:53] WeaponII: idk about Method, man
[1:42:03] excessior: less than 200 pulls, was it not hard enough
[1:42:05] Supers18: Towelliee u think denathrius was undertuned or underwhelming i mean only 144 pulls
[1:42:09] rosina_scarlett: If SLG wasn't bugged for over 200 pulls denthrius wouldn't have
[1:42:12] bad_fish_too: 146
[1:42:14] GenMysters: Method will compete as well as echo next tier.
[1:42:17] NoWaayMan: whats crazy is that both teams at different times had a legit shot at killing it. what a race man
[1:42:21] talic420: more gera
[1:42:23] WeaponII: 146, Stone was 298 for Limit
[1:42:25] Kinghorn: they spent more on sludgefist than sire
[1:42:26] Tiger2hunt: not to mention sludgefest
[1:42:27] talic420: more gear
[1:42:36] Crazycajun985: 2nd to last had way too many bugs
[1:42:40] icerasta: a lot more gear though for sire
[1:42:47] isollator85: stone was due to bugs
[1:42:51] kylos123: they done same in uldir too... i think mythrax was harder than ghuun
[1:43:01] excessior: surprised no bugs for denathrius
[1:43:18] KonradGM: you don't want to pug lol
[1:43:19] WeaponII: it's crazy that Sludge was supposed to be the "wall" in progression
[1:43:30] GenMysters: It is only first tier though @Towelliee It will be harder as the tiers go along.
[1:44:02] Kaykerrs: Hey Towel, how's it going kaykerHI
[1:44:16] xxsargexx: i mean only reason stone legion generals took so long is because of all the bugs
[1:44:32] ambiotic: lightee said it was the hardest boss ever on a tank
[1:44:35] TheCliffyShow: Wonder how many people were pissed that Garrosh didn't show up.
[1:44:39] Supers18: they had more pulls on sludgefist
[1:44:48] darkrowse21: i thought there would be a cinematic tease next patch or garry clip
[1:45:10] zjordan88: limit said brew is terible for denath
[1:45:15] GenMysters: Prot Warrior tanks. Physical damage.

[1:47:10] osheait: hes north
[1:47:22] GenMysters: @Towelliee what I was happy to see was the use of prot Warrior. They were supposed to be dead this tier.

[1:49:44] Coffish123: You really gives Limit the RWF when they many hours ahead?
[1:49:50] corey3322: looking like boobs at a 45 degree angle just north of the right boob

[1:50:37] shogon: @Coffish123 does it really matter when they all copy each othere's strats?
[1:50:40] peinen: @Coffish123 I bet you didnt say shit like this for when Echo, method and any other EU guild won
[1:50:52] GameWithDerp: all they need to do is a universal release
[1:51:04] shogon: they need a competition server
[1:51:09] shogon: only way to fix
[1:51:15] donttouchmyhonk: I think it's great the way it is right now. Blizzard should continue to just be available for game breaking hot fixes
[1:51:18] Coffish123: Im actually not fan of anyone - But if Echo wins or EU its worth, because the US has many hours ahead
[1:51:34] swandiesel: they need to be able to start at the same time.
[1:51:51] Bakuryuha96: No they dont. its fine the way it is
[1:51:55] brain_wash: It's not really a head start imo, when the guilds starting later just copy the strats and catch up immediately....
[1:51:56] Clicklesly: Can't buy BoEs on the private server too Kappa
[1:52:14] TheCliffyShow: Sounds like a mess.
[1:52:18] Supers18: its too messy for blizz to get involved
[1:52:22] Tiger2hunt: the truth is world first isnt really over yet... 12 hours still not over
[1:52:24] s_t_o_r_m__: Yeah that will be messy lol
[1:52:32] Coffish123: Its not variables at all - just let them start att the same time.. Its not really like anyone else gonna win anyway
[1:52:34] wreckedgum: just make release schedule and resets global and the problem is solved. keep it with the community, dont need blizz fucking it up
[1:52:41] Luthercorpz: LUL
[1:52:43] Kneckt: KEKW
[1:52:44] MrGattz: just leave
[1:52:44] Bigirishred: World first race is all about the work you put into it. private server would be stupid
[1:52:45] Luthercorpz: Sheeeeit
[1:52:46] Aedarax: KEKW
[1:52:46] TheCliffyShow: Race is over and Max still has 35k.
[1:52:48] Kinghorn: LUL
[1:52:50] Vodkanic: KEKW
[1:52:53] Vodkanic: EU MALDING
[1:52:56] GenMysters: This race was perfect. Last boss took PERFECT coordination. @Towelliee
[1:52:58] Tiger2hunt: the head start dont count ? really ?
[1:53:07] donttouchmyhonk: you can compare total time raiding or total time on the last boss if you really want to, but it's over...
[1:53:12] Sincline387: Not a speed run, worlds first not worlds fastst.....and besides echo will take 12 hours of breaks tomorrow
[1:53:13] Supers18: Tiger2hunt the bugs dont count?
[1:53:15] noctivaro: @Tiger2hunt M A L D I N G
[1:53:17] peinen: imagine thinking 7 hours is THAT big of a deal
[1:53:24] Shugnight: true
[1:53:25] swampt1l: I mean limit had bugged bosses LUL @tiger2hunt
[1:53:26] Bakuryuha96: The head start didnt count when method lapped limit in BOD so no it dont count
[1:53:27] Tiger2hunt: i hate echo ... i was rooting for limit but fair is fair
[1:53:28] Dravek63: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:53:30] redbulladin: but can you agree it would be more of a race if they released it at the same time? since even limit thinks it should be global release
[1:53:35] Kaykerrs: Dang I missed you shave your head towel lol
[1:53:36] rosina_scarlett: I was hyped to see Desmephisto casting BDGG
[1:53:37] Luthercorpz: I watch Complexity's stream mainly
[1:53:39] swampt1l: towHAMUP towDerp
[1:53:41] Clicklesly: If those 12 hours would count for anything Echo would do splits before going for Sire today ^^
[1:53:41] Bigirishred: Imagione EU bitching about hours when they have had how many world firsts
[1:53:55] WeaponII: now I want to see BDGG get to the finish line
[1:53:55] queeflabs: "i hate echo" how.. theyre like.. a new guild made up on non pedos
[1:53:56] Avinar: was like 2-3 hours of extended maintenance and bugged bosses LUL
[1:54:01] Tiger2hunt: i repeat i was rooting for limit i hate echo ... BUT the head start is there you cant denie it ... fair is fair
[1:54:02] redbulladin: but they won and thats it cant really do anything about it
[1:54:09] showmethesugar35: OTK was way to cringe
[1:54:14] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard isn't changing how they do things for world first races.
[1:54:17] Coffish123: If echo moves to NA - Limit wouldnt stand a chance
[1:54:20] bigdaddystunna: OTK coverage was god awful
[1:54:22] LunaKura: @Towelliee Are you/your guild looking for gatherers?
[1:54:22] s_t_o_r_m__: They already said they would
[1:54:31] necralia: yeah
[1:54:32] swampt1l: What? KEKW @coffish123
[1:54:32] wreckedgum: OTK smh....
[1:54:33] ohnot___her: Tiger2hunt I love how youre not talking about the bugs that people are talking about
[1:54:33] Kneckt: KEKW
[1:54:33] Luthercorpz: TRUE
[1:54:35] necralia: it was bad
[1:54:36] Vodkanic: lol right
[1:54:36] noctivaro: true OTK FAIL

[1:54:45] slimoby: asmon lazy?
[1:54:46] Avinar: I think they felt bored or something idk
[1:54:46] sumsnacks: OTK is just meming lol
[1:54:47] feelingthis2020: PRECISELY
[1:54:47] wah7767: OTK, bust
[1:54:53] donttouchmyhonk: OTK instead had Santa and a girl
[1:54:53] noctivaro: OTK SUCKS
[1:54:54] CootsFC: OTK was just day 1 view count
[1:54:56] fluh_: Then fans would bitch about ping when they lost KEKW
[1:54:58] OlHotrodEvans: it would still be a win for NA if echo moved over :D
[1:55:01] jerseyfive: they let limit and echo get the views
[1:55:02] WeaponII: Who is OTK anyways?
[1:55:05] showmethesugar35: Ok im gonna said, OTK was dog shit
[1:55:06] Abbz44: OTK did some of their coverage from a wrestling ring for gods sake, that ust doesn't fit
[1:55:06] Thunderbrew: What is OTK?
[1:55:08] Wcvechten: They wanted to let people go home for christmas
[1:55:10] Avinar: esfands also super busy with doing tons of stuff. but idk about asmon
[1:55:17] Chrysophylax_I: the only people that knew what was going on was Asmon and Moogs and hes not even in OTK
[1:55:17] Tiger2hunt: @OHNOTHER Method dealt with Bugs too WITH a 12 hour hold back aswell back when they kept getting world first you cant use bugs as an excuse bud
[1:55:32] necralia: it was 5% coverage and the rest was pure clown things
[1:55:35] wreckedgum: and they pulled alot of viewers away from the good coverage fs...
[1:55:36] MrGattz: cause they werent seeing the money flow in probly
[1:55:43] solsaver12: agree
[1:55:46] Marcostretch7: Hey boo, shaved head fits you well
[1:55:51] Avinar: OTK memes and such

[1:56:34] jaded_sama: oh man this chat is awful
[1:56:41] GenMysters: @redbulladin can you agree it doesn't matter. 12 hours only matters the first day. After the sludgefist wall and first week of splits it is even as far as time is concerned.
[1:56:46] feherlofia123: best part of OTK is rich
[1:56:52] Lockrocker: they will insult you (the viewer) but bad you once you say something about them.. they are a bunch of idiots
[1:56:53] Avinar: @Beyond_The_Invisible yeah he's got old races, retail, wanting to play madden, hanging out with jinnytty and the OTK stuff. he had his own stuff going on to be fair not just always OTK WF coverage

[1:58:46] kodtheog: i agree limits casting was really well done
[1:58:47] MTaylorRacing: Otk was fun to watch, but it wasnt a traditional RWF thing

[2:01:12] s_t_o_r_m__: I totally missed BDG coverage D:
[2:01:17] TheCliffyShow: I watched the Big Dumb Guild coverage once and enjoyed it.

[4:15:11] SmackemJack: @archaic78 that's just total BS man they dont copy anything they just echo
[4:15:14] bartemus_prime: do you know roughly how many Method players are in Echo or is the majority of them?
[4:15:15] roflpotamus: Id say method did pgood for this tier under their rebuild
[4:15:16] Aidler: and it really would be no problem to let anyone start at the same time. it's just Ions ego
[4:15:26] xmedpakx: @bartemus_prime lol
[4:15:27] KAZ1IN: did he change necro for kyrian?
[4:15:29] SageRuskiy: How is it ego lol
[4:15:31] Noshpan: Every time you mention Echo, my Alexa device wakes up. And I have to remind her that they're talking about a guild. LUL
[4:15:32] lirly__: sco wasnt that good, he got carried for being the GM
[4:15:35] Jeffblute88: Not everyone in Echo is getting mad, only a few loud few so dont bash all of them.
[4:15:52] duhworks: its fine that they don't start at the same time EU can copy there strats and be on the same boss the very next day
[4:15:54] xmedpakx: @SmackemJack oops lol for you
[4:16:05] Aidler: @sage_ruskiy what else? there is no other reason
[4:16:13] roflpotamus: "sco wasnt that good" has multiple world firsts ???
[4:16:20] mattoxi: and the +2 day for asians like "cosmetic racism" :p
[4:16:30] SageRuskiy: @Aidler It fucks everyone outside the race if raid releases at 2 am for KR for example
[4:16:35] Atokiri: i dont trust this dungeon with grievous
[4:16:37] SmackemJack: @archaic78 i knew lol
[4:16:44] SageRuskiy: NA was dogshit for years in RWF
[4:16:48] Aidler: no it won't
[4:16:52] SageRuskiy: Its not a conspiracy
[4:16:56] Dmntd_1: Big guilds already screw up their "sleep" it would be nothing to them to flip to a mid shift raiding schedule.
[4:17:06] SmackemJack: sco guild is like 3rd or 4th right now right? he's good but it was just time for a change
[4:17:11] Aidler: why does the time matter. it doesn't
[4:17:18] SmackemJack: Regardless For the Boys Murica baby
[4:17:38] SageRuskiy: Okay you can disagree with their reasoning, but dont deny its existence or say its "Ions Ego" lol
[4:17:42] duhworks: the time matters a lot the WFR will never be fair
[4:17:44] JAG19d: OG Method (Echo) is second, New Method is like 5th?
[4:17:59] Dmntd_1: Life isnt fair get over it
[4:18:05] Jaeyd: Limit ran into a bunch of bugs that they had to wait on to be fixed, which let everyone else catch up. So it's not like the time was even a big deal.
[4:18:22] SmackemJack: @duhworks i think if they start at the same time they will have a harder time "echoing" limit strats which they have done for the last 2 races
[4:18:26] roflpotamus: they do
[4:18:28] Jaeyd: Every other guild also gets to see their strats for the fights which makes it easier for them to progress.
[4:18:43] hunterxp: tru
[4:18:47] theGooderz: you only have to look at the amount of pulls to understand time time difference was a difference
[4:18:53] shimwood: Every crying about copying Limit's strats as if every NA guild was 9/10 today OMEGALUL
[4:18:58] Aidler: it's no real reason. it's simply not. so whatelse is there. we don't need to simply accept anything they say
[4:19:16] mattoxi: @Jaeyd nice logic pepega explain the +2 day for asians FailFish
[4:19:19] Dmntd_1: Just accept the fact limit has WF
[4:19:22] Dmntd_1: easy
[4:19:25] hunterxp: If it works it works. no shame
[4:19:29] SmackemJack: @shimwood i mean it helps but you still have to have the players to pull it off and Echo have the players there is no denying it. Limit FTW!
[4:19:36] Aidler: think for a second. time does not matter. so...?
[4:19:50] SageRuskiy: Do you speak for everyone though?
[4:19:52] xxsargexx: NA's been getting smashed in world firsts for like the last what 8 or 10 years? and now all of a sudden its a problem when NA starts winning world firsts?
[4:19:56] Baron_Pandacula: @Dmntd_1 there isnt anyone denying the fact that they won, tho
[4:20:13] NaoriMMO: NaoriMMO subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[4:20:18] Aidler: how could I and why does it matter?
[4:20:32] Relic7: If Big Fat Shark day raided, I think they could compete.
[4:20:34] MankiGames: @ItsPetahhhh There are plenty of people trolling that though
[4:20:38] Relic7: They only do evening raiding, and they are currently 5th
[4:20:41] duhworks: @SmackemJack true they will be forced to come up with there own strats to some degree but they will still copy each other a lot cause both guilds have someone watching the other guild
[4:20:43] Jaeyd: @xxsargexx It's just all salt.
[4:21:02] SmackemJack: @duhworks no Limit has no one to copy as of now...
[4:21:16] shimwood: @SmackemJack Exactly, copying is meaningless if you can't execute.
[4:21:30] TexValhalla: i don't think anyone was really crying tbh lol, every seeing WF guild has someone they have spy on other streams to see what's going on, secondly it's hilarious everyone want to start saying the time difference is such a huge advantage now when Method (Echo) literally owned the world first scene since mythic came out. But now that they gettin beat everyone wanna bitch, WF is WF
[4:21:34] Relic7: Max was saying this evening that he genuinely thinks they could compete with Echo and Limit if they got that backing
[4:21:51] SmackemJack: @shimwood but its not meaningless for someone like echo who can compete its an advantage not having to learn boss strats. Double edge sword my guy
[4:21:51] DragonofWolves: dragonofwolves subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! 2 more months. counting down that 6 year hammer
[4:21:56] GrimmStalkR: they only raid 4-6 hours they did an interview yesterday on one of the WF streams
[4:22:00] the_viznar: what up @Towelliee ! Any thoughts on Prot Warriors being the play in CN?
[4:22:05] Aztecwarrior74: Wait raiders get paid?!?!?!
[4:22:05] Aidler: good. 3 is better then 2 in the race
[4:22:11] ArcaneMaki: I miss Towel weakaura that showed is character iLvl.
[4:22:21] Relic7: @GrittyTexan Point makes no sense, you're not going to complain when NA couldn't leverage the advantage because they were no where near on par with EU.
[4:22:32] DragonofWolves: er wait.. 5 years I think
[4:22:41] DragonofWolves: hell I lost count
[4:22:41] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:22:56] SmackemJack: I'm a Huge Max fan the guys demeanor is just too good. I love it so win or lose IM cheering Limit all the way. Gotta support the boys
[4:22:56] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[4:23:10] TexValhalla: @Relic7 And yet they were still involving themselves in the WF raid scene and still getting beat every raid, but now they aren't weird huh LUL
[4:23:47] Grady2385: @Towelliee man i would love to see you main a warrior tank again like the good old days man
[4:23:54] Relic7: @Relic7 Again this doesn't make any sense? I'm in EU and I support Limit, and really enjoyed the race. But this idea and mantra coming out that Method never used to complain makes no sense whatso ever. You don't complain when you win and NA can't leverage the advantage.
[4:24:01] DragonofWolves: are people still debating the whole global release thing? ugh this wouldn't be a thing is echo had gotten it. just throwing that out there
[4:24:12] campingking615: rough time being by yourself this time of year
[4:24:48] Nauk: lmao i forgot about the bet, GG NA
[4:25:10] Chris_127: i fell you @campingking615 really sad year
[4:25:25] swordwindgaming: imagine not being quarantined a few months before getting vaccinated
[4:25:51] Atviks: its a 16 hour headstart, they should release the raids on the same time.
[4:26:06] fluh_: how big is towelclaus sack this year? Kappa
[4:26:10] CDubTheRIPper: do you still have a tank on limit? LUL
[4:26:10] Nauk: GG to you too then!
[4:26:10] MistaHat: here comes the ""you think your hair will grow back???" questions
[4:26:12] TexValhalla: @Relic7 it was never "Method" who complained or said shit, it was the fan boys of them that did and are now. Method and now Echo have said multiple times now that WF is WF and a W is a W. I'm not talking about the guild themselves I'm talking about the fan base that comp[lains about i tnow all of a sudden
[4:26:14] swordwindgaming: Blizzard doesn't care about the race enough to do that. Its just free publicity for them.
[4:26:17] ArcaneLight: oof
[4:26:28] pooranoia: how much is considered high addon memory should i worry about it
[4:26:30] Atviks: its not as fun if its unfair like that. but it is what it is.
[4:26:33] swordwindgaming: If they cared, they would lock Mythic resets to euro time.
[4:26:45] Atviks: how many hours ago was the limit kill ?
[4:26:47] TexValhalla: @Aztecwarrior74 fuck yeah they do
[4:26:47] nikodemuscrowley: @Atviks then they would complain they have to raid in the middle of the night, it ll always be something, they lost
[4:26:56] Primextime12: has anyone leveled an alt recently? do you still need to switch to threads of fate right before hitting 60? or did they fix that
[4:27:01] Relic7: @Relic7 Echo have said this evening that they were forced to call of HC splits because of how hard Limit were pounding Denarius. They said that in previous tiers the 16 hours advantage has never been an issue, but now with the calibre that Limit are at, it genuinely is, and they know how to maximise their time.
[4:27:03] Atviks: Drussin, that doesnt matter then they raid in the middle of the night.
[4:27:09] ArcaneMaki: @Atviks 4-5 hours ago.
[4:27:10] SageRuskiy: @Primextime12 They fixed it. U can switch at 60
[4:27:11] Atviks: who cares, they can whine then
[4:27:14] DragonofWolves: did anyone see the clip of max bolting down the room? I swear you think that man runs track
[4:27:19] Primextime12: @sage_ruskiy ty
[4:27:21] Truedusk: towel what are your thoughts on the KFConsole? Kappa
[4:27:54] tonyr23: tonyr23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[4:28:08] SK1NFATHER: dude sounds like a decepticon lol
[4:28:19] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy whats your fav ds3 build?
[4:29:02] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli I havent played vanilla Ds3 in a while but I loved Sellsword Winblades, dex>sex
[4:29:16] TexValhalla: @Relic7 I mean I still wouldn't agree with that tbh, because they had a way better percent before reset than Limit did, then had all day just like Limit did to re clear. The true stat that won this race for Limit to me was the fact that they absolutely annihilated all there re clears and splits much faster than anyone would have ever thought they would have, including Limit themselves
[4:29:22] Vivelli: vanilla? you mean theres chocolate? @sage_ruskiy
[4:29:24] TexValhalla: but that's just me
[4:29:28] SmackemJack: @dragonofwolves hell yea i watched it. Its been a long time from my man max all the way from Duality. He deserves it all.
[4:29:30] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli Modded xD
[4:29:31] DragonofWolves: eh, main point is both guilds did good. proud of both echo and limit for the hours they've put in. that's all that matters is having FUN
[4:29:51] Ultimate_CD3: I
[4:29:55] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy ye, didnt know there was mods for it ill have to check that out
[4:29:57] swordwindgaming: echo got dena down to 4% on their what third try?
[4:30:11] Masqerader: hmm this must be a display error my +8 key says prideful on it lol
[4:30:13] swordwindgaming: could have easily made a laughing stock out of limit if things were a little different
[4:30:17] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli realistically there is 1 mod, https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/310?tab=description
[4:30:21] Atviks: they still have 12 hours to kill it
[4:30:24] Grady2385: what nameplates addon are you using and mouse?
[4:30:37] fluh_: @Atviks lmao no its over. limit won
[4:30:45] nihilistic_bat: 12 hours KEKW
[4:30:49] cravecrate: @Atviks get over it my dude
[4:30:53] azzurrin: It
[4:30:55] SmackemJack: @Towelliee right it had my fucking heart pumping
[4:31:01] Relic7: @Relic7 I don't get how you can't agree with it, even Max and Limit has said they want to see world wide release, which shows that they to an extent understand that there is an argument that the 16-hours is an advantage.
[4:31:02] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy shit i havent used nexus in a minute, sweet ty
[4:31:07] Atviks: ? I dont care about either of these guilds BTW, what is with the blind fanboyism
[4:31:08] Colosseus_dk: Anyone have the clip of Max storming the 100 meter dash after kill? :)
[4:31:12] Atviks: how the fuck do you guys not want to be accurate
[4:31:17] nihilistic_bat: I was on an escalation call at the time on hold, and when the lady came back she was like hello, hello
[4:31:17] nevercluckyy: the way i look at it with the 16 hours advantage thing going around is that its called the race to world first not the race to who clears the raid in the least amount of raid itme
[4:31:30] SmackemJack: @Atviks edgy :)
[4:31:31] Atviks: they literally had a headstart, idgaf who actually wins.
[4:31:32] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli Its a 5 gig mod that turns ds3 from like a play once every half year game, to play every month game Imo
[4:31:39] TexValhalla: Viks what you talkin about man LUL
[4:31:44] azzurrin: it's amazing how 16hrs head start is now a 'problem' since NA has a team that can compete and claim world best now.
[4:31:45] Tramel0117: Relic did you also hear max say that they had to deal with allied he hits and the 6 hours of extended maintenance that echo did not
[4:31:50] Energyzer9301: @Relic7 Not necessairly, i mean i want world wide releases too. But i dont think for any second that they had an advantage, even as a EU person myself :D
[4:31:55] nihilistic_bat: so dumb, LUL NA was down half the day, and bugged bosses
[4:32:00] Atviks: we can start counting china or w/e their p2p systems in it too i guess √û
[4:32:02] Relic7: @azzurrin Bceause before there was never really a team that could leverage that advantage, there now is.
[4:32:02] Atviks: ?
[4:32:03] Tramel0117: Sorry all the bugs
[4:32:08] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy lol that explains alot actually
[4:32:23] Relic7: @Energyzer_The_Kermit You don't think there is an advantage in the slightest? Not even in the second week reset?
[4:32:35] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli explains alot about what? slootHmm
[4:32:46] Atviks: it doesnt matter if echo have to raid during the night, as long as the reset starts at the same time, its free for all
[4:32:50] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy well mostly explains why its ur fall back i think
[4:33:00] Relic7: @Tramel0117 Yes I did, and as I have said, I supported Limit. But fan boys putting on blinkers that there is not an argument for the advantage is a little frustrating
[4:33:00] TexValhalla: Reset will never be able to start at the same time
[4:33:06] SageRuskiy: @Atviks Hey friend CHinas client is the same as ours since legion, except for censoring some stuff
[4:33:08] DragonofWolves: Yeah all except blizz won't do a global release. trying to get them to do that is like trying to pull teeth
[4:33:11] Zettabyte: good morning towHi
[4:33:13] manessagra: Limit is better, no other way around it, the raid looked way better and more organized, strats were top notch etc. I'm from EU but Limit is defo the best guild atm.
[4:33:15] Atviks: then we have to count the hour difference.
[4:33:20] Atviks: oh, didnt know that at all sage.
[4:33:25] Artivicii: are spinemaw gladechewers rare?
[4:33:36] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[4:33:37] Atviks: im not in eu, I play on US
[4:33:40] Relic7: @manessagra 110% agree
[4:33:51] Energyzer9301: @Relic7 Not enough to make an impact on the results no. NA still also had to suffer through and basically beta test all the bugs at the start aswell. And when some say that NA gets a advantage with getting far ahead. Dont forget that the EU guilds will/have always catched up fast due to using same tacts.
[4:33:54] SageRuskiy: @Atviks Their bonus rolls used to be guaranteed, but they disabledthat in BFA, and theres no rolls in SL

[4:33:55] Nauk: tbh if limit was not streaming they would be probably solo on the last 3 bosses kill list.
[4:34:10] DragonofWolves: and besides weekly resets would be fucked if blizz did a global release
[4:34:15] Atviks: I liked limits streams better as well. I just want to be accurate on the clears tbfh
[4:34:16] SageRuskiy: Idk except for sludgefist Echo and Limit were neck and neck
[4:34:40] SageRuskiy: Im a fan of limits comms over Echos though, echos were alot more rowdy
[4:35:00] SageRuskiy: Roger brown dying early ever 2nd pull was a good fucking meme though KEKW
[4:35:18] fireskidd: 86
[4:35:21] tonyr23: did mythic sire Denathrius have a secret fight or no?
[4:35:21] morpheus2k16: 86%
[4:35:24] DrLegend305: 86-88 I think
[4:35:25] Masqerader: i think 86-88
[4:35:25] Trainedx: 86
[4:35:25] Worgenrunt01: @sage_ruskiy slootHmm
[4:35:26] Boomchakz: we kill the right side before we go down
[4:35:30] Relic7: @Energyzer_The_Kermit I agree to an extent, but I still think there is a satisfactory argument to be made that the day advantage plays a large impact on the second week of reset, where Limit do not feel pressure during re-clear and HC splits, where EU does, as if you look at WF, they tend to happen on Day 7-9
[4:35:31] jaibathehut: 86.5
[4:35:33] doomester: 85%
[4:35:41] manessagra: Echo looked like a bunch of tantrum throwing kids, it was so unprofessional honestly.
[4:35:42] Zeroblazin: Yeah I think 86%
[4:36:06] DragonofWolves: hmm what time did mythic castle unlock for NA anyone remember?
[4:36:09] jaibathehut: 61.67 before spider boss trash
[4:36:19] Relic7: @manessagra They were gutted, as months of preparation they lost but Gingi, Fragnance and all the other big raiders congratulated Limit and said what good raiders Limit were.
[4:36:33] CDubTheRIPper: yeah it looked more like disappointment
[4:36:35] spekktrum19: scripe
[4:36:36] spekktrum19: sounded bad
[4:36:45] jinnchu: scripe was bad in coms after limits kill
[4:36:47] SageRuskiy: @Towelliee He was refferring to comms of Echo vs Limit, not the reaction
[4:36:48] spekktrum19: sounded a lot of a sore loser
[4:36:54] CDubTheRIPper: they were the closest too
[4:37:01] biggchunguss99: you invest that much time and lose it...gotta be tough to take
[4:37:02] CDubTheRIPper: to limit that is
[4:37:03] Worgenrunt01: slootFat
[4:37:03] Vivelli: im sure there were a few bad remarks after losing, but idk about tantrums
[4:37:09] Nauk: yeah they were serious contenders and good raiders, i would be sad too
[4:37:11] Grady2385: @Towelliee what is the second best tank now other then DH
[4:37:18] Mythridium: i think it hit hardest this time since it was so close
[4:37:21] manessagra: During their tries, nothing getting loot etc. the reactions were distasteful
[4:37:44] spekktrum19: scripe basically said that if they kill it in the next 16 hours, they technically killed it fastest
[4:37:50] Mythridium: limit had super quick turn arounds between pulls, echo took forever between every pull
[4:38:01] Relic7: @manessagra Oh please give it a rest, they're in a race for god's sake of course they're not going to be happy and dandy lmao

[4:38:02] ArcaneMaki: Wondering if they're going to be invited to the White House someday.
[4:38:05] SageRuskiy: then Limit memed by saying "Race to worlds fastest" isnt over KEKW
[4:38:10] Tramel0117: Scripts needs to take that 8 hours they didn‚Äôt stream off of that
[4:38:14] Tramel0117: Scripe
[4:38:16] manessagra: i highly doubt Scripe will lead Echi again
[4:38:19] Vivelli: they probably lost alot of money on this loss too (sponsors, bets, viewership, etc) so its not just about the win sometimes
[4:38:37] Syrion93: Why is it so hard for people to enjoy 2 good guide going neck to neck in a wf race? Echo reacted just like any losing side would but twitch chat morons creating drama as always
[4:38:47] SageRuskiy: Going dark on Donny prog was distasteful in my opinion
[4:38:47] swordwindgaming: because nerds gotta fanboy
[4:38:51] GeeThePally: Mad that this has some people arguing about it lol, if echo down it tomorrow they will probs do it quicker than Limit, however Limit still downed the bosses first, real simple can‚Äôt see why people getting so mad about it
[4:39:08] Jeffblute88: @Syrion93 I couldn't have said it any better!
[4:39:12] Nauk: it was a lowblow to viewers yeah
[4:39:19] NazzyBear: who won the race
[4:39:22] swordwindgaming: in reality it doesn't matter who got world first compared to which guilds cleared the entire raid this week
[4:39:27] SageRuskiy: but they lost LUL
[4:39:28] Vivelli: yeah with how close it was, it was a great race in the end
[4:39:34] Relic7: @Syrion93 Agree, I loved the race and I really enjoy watching Limit more than the EU guilds, but the vehement defence of either side is really boring. Both sides in denial to each others arguments is really tiring
[4:39:35] manessagra: no drama, just observation. i enjoyed the race quite a bit
[4:39:56] Mythridium: it was awesome having both streams open and seeing them both smack the boss at the same time, was really enjoyable

[4:40:03] SageRuskiy: the limit wipe on 0.9%
[4:40:04] Nauk: karma knows haha

[4:40:34] draqqis: I thought they would be lower than 30 or so?
[4:40:39] Bringerofdeath: seriously went to bed with that that thought
[4:40:45] Vivelli: yea
[4:40:54] cthyt7: I feel like who ever gets to the last boss first and starts getting in attempts wins
[4:41:00] SageRuskiy: Yeah i thought they discovered some cheese or smth
[4:41:04] SageRuskiy: but no
[4:41:08] Chris_127: the second they turned off there streams they deserved the L
[4:41:11] biggchunguss99: Do you think going forward sponsors will set some sort of boundaries about shutting streams down?
[4:41:14] Tramel0117: I was expecting to be aoe up to echo killing it
[4:41:18] Tramel0117: Wake
[4:41:19] Mythridium: near the end though, it was clear the limit was just cleaning up ph3, but echo still had some learning to do on ph3, imo
[4:41:21] p1zzatut: hi guys
[4:41:22] Relic7: @cthyt7 That's expected. more exposure to the boss, better knowledge you have to kill it
[4:41:24] Puppette: I like how max said part of being a leader is being an emotional leader
[4:41:24] Shpetznaz: I wouldn't mind it so much if they didn't accept donations/subs to "support their stream"
[4:41:43] MuttonChopins: You guys do know blizzard devs are watching them in-game
[4:41:47] SageRuskiy: @bigchunguss_1987 Limit isnt allowed to not stream kills. The Xymox/council was accident
[4:42:06] swordwindgaming: blizzard devs are watching for balancing reasons, not because they care about the world first race
[4:42:07] manessagra: i mean ppl are paying 5$ to watch, Netflix is 7.99$...
[4:42:07] Syrion93: "accident"
[4:42:22] Eziak: Imagine not streaming and losing lol
[4:42:29] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy you sure about that? did they say it was in their contracts or somthin?
[4:42:32] Nauk: if limit had a secret comp/technique for denathrius they would have done it too... sadly
[4:42:32] SageRuskiy: @Towelliee Echo is also a new brand, while Method was an established titan of the WoW world
[4:42:36] Mythridium: imagine blizzard not getting in on it to make some cash
[4:42:41] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli I heard it from multiple sources
[4:42:47] Vivelli: @sage_ruskiy ok slasher
[4:42:48] biggchunguss99: If they expect this to get more popular and gain more attention going forward, I dont see how shutting streams down could be allowed.
[4:42:49] draqqis: They have some of the same sponsors as Limit with the exception of Redbull, I think.
[4:42:51] Vivelli: :P
[4:42:57] SageRuskiy: @Vivelli Im not saying its a fucking fact KEKW
[4:42:58] Relic7: @swordwindgaming Blizzard definitely care about WF raiding now, it is an incredible spectacle focused on their 16 year old game which has picked up such popularity on Twitch. My friends who don't even play WoW, watch the World First Race.
[4:43:02] Vivelli: KEKW
[4:43:11] Relic7: But I don't think it is a main focus
[4:43:26] Syrion93: I mean how hard it is to understand that as a guild you will do everything possible to win?
[4:43:52] SageRuskiy: @Relic7 They explicitly said in an interview after Nyalotha they view it as an "awesome community ran event" not an esport, and that they would neither police nor interfere in it save to fix bugs
[4:43:52] MuttonChopins: So what's everyone talking about? I'm out of the loop
[4:43:56] itsClupsy: just joined, is it double monk rn
[4:44:12] biggchunguss99: @sage_ruskiy yeah I heard someone say that were not allowed to turn stream off. I'm not feeling any kind of way about who did it or anything, just trying to think about how it can grow viewership going forward.
[4:44:15] Aidler: I was initally rooting for Echo.. but after that "not streaming" shit I changed to Limit.
[4:44:31] Relic7: @sage_ruskiy That doesn't mean they "don't care"
[4:44:45] Vivelli: I would like for blizz to setup some sort of tourney for speed running a raid though, for charity or w/e
[4:44:55] SageRuskiy: @Relic7 I wasnt countering your point friend, merely explaining their stance
[4:45:09] Relic7: @sage_ruskiy Ah got you. :)
[4:45:12] manessagra: Limit is just more enjoyable to watch. Calm comms, no super egos screeching
[4:45:22] Syrion93: People are acting so entitled nowadays. How dare they to not stream !!
[4:45:33] SageRuskiy: @Relic7 If anything it put pressure on blizz to make better mythic bosses, since now alot more of the world sees them
[4:46:01] swordwindgaming: LImit kept talking about dicks and hard f*king
[4:46:10] SageRuskiy: Limits banter was great
[4:46:12] DrCsquared: !armory

[4:47:26] Truedusk: towellie what flavor do you think goes best in the KFConsole? Extra crispy or original recipe? Kappa
[4:47:33] Relic7: @sage_ruskiy Agree, I think the pressure is growing on therm to professionalize it, but I think the cascading affect that has on the wider game is massive that they don't want to take on
[4:47:47] Kaykerrs: always giving Towel m y loot it the fee for dying like an idiot lmao
[4:47:54] Syrion93: Listen Im from EU, I think Limit is an insanely good guild and absolutely deserved the win. The only pathetic part is twitch chat degens acting entitled, creating drama a going crazy coz Echo decided to not stream for a day.
[4:47:56] Grady2385: @Towelliee what mouse are you using and what is the best second tank in the game for mythics for now
[4:48:06] SageRuskiy: What effect? no guild is as organized or wealthy enough to emulate Limit or Echo
[4:48:08] Thunderbrew: I'm sad for your Paladin.
[4:48:22] ArcaneMaki: Ghost hair
[4:48:23] iunbearable: wait until you go outside
[4:48:28] SageRuskiy: I will bet that a fuckton of people started leveling monks after seeing Trill fuck

[4:48:38] Deathkanigit101: @Towelliee Turn on a fans see if you can't tell the difference then.
[4:49:01] Mythridium: the issue I see with blizzard stepping in to professionalize it, is that it will end up ruining the experience for the teams, they now have additional rules to abide by
[4:49:17] swordwindgaming: I'm more curious about 4 UDKs in the Limit raid makeup than the Monks
[4:49:18] SageRuskiy: and it wont be as natural
[4:49:22] manessagra: froze to death in Cali? is that even possible? :)
[4:49:28] Relic7: @sage_ruskiy Fat Shark Yes could easily reach the level of Echo and Limit, all they are missing is a sponsor to commit to day-time raiding, they are 5th currently with only evening time raiding.
[4:49:36] SageRuskiy: I dont think Max could say "Slam Double dick Donny " on a blizzard stream KEKW
[4:49:44] biggchunguss99: lol

Extra impressive watching all the slight tactical refinements and composure even with very strong competition getting close to a kill too. A rough couple of days for Larries everywhere.

[5:08:18] Anderus00: hm... that's a good point. you would think the dmg and movement speed would inc overtime
[5:08:19] danksportscards: darkee said block is insane
[5:08:22] Affiiance: Max said Rally and the other tanks are just a squish or worse

[5:09:23] beardedpookie: If i heard him correctly he said that it was for the buff and rally primarily
[5:09:26] crixus250x: tht an they said mst of hte dmg is Physical an warriors do so well when the boss is dealing Physical dmg
[5:09:26] Anderus00: what was the tank comp they did?
