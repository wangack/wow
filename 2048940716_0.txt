[2:38:35] Wulfgrym: i think there are way more buyers than people realize and might really hit the sub base
[2:38:39] Amarlian: Do you think they could achieve the same if the bans were super long. Like a 3-6 month ban might make a statement @Towelliee
[2:38:57] im_capy: Maybe they will use Ai for bans, and itll be an asshole Ai
[2:39:00] MoonwalkingAngel: i bought gold but in tbc a couple times

[3:54:26] Wulfgrym: dual wield warr tank weapon
[3:54:27] Molvonos: Wonder how that'd work for a warlock
[3:54:28] byrdeen45: oh ok
[3:54:36] OGaxelaw: i dont play classic but i mean if players can dodge gdkp on there own by being in a guild and or starting there own group, they shouldnt exclude people who just like it that way doing gdkp.

[4:40:37] raldrik: As a bills fan I hope he does not come to buffalo. There is no way I could ever hope belichick wins anything
[4:40:38] Verdell263: Jerry will never give Bill the control he wants. Stop it
[4:40:47] PotbellyGoat: Bigrizz is a hilarious name
[4:40:48] JMoney_1331: Jerry needs to sit his wrinkly ass down and back off lol
