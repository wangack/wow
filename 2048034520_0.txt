[8:03:19] shozgodx: crusader ofc lmao
[8:03:25] mr0hn0h3didnt: marm has rank 1 every class
[8:03:25] snorkkisss: @mwako ye thats him
[8:03:28] JC_officiel: Marm has had rank one on all specs for a long time.
[8:03:31] kloperx: whazz also
[8:03:36] d1vbno: shobek does
[8:03:43] mwako: ye marm did actually have on pretty much every class i think
[8:04:05] mr0hn0h3didnt: but private server rank 1 doesn’t really count
[8:04:05] Srenix: Not every class bro, every spec, Marm <3
[8:04:18] body_type_two: yea not every class
[8:04:23] mwako: @mr0hn0h3didnt every good player from all around the world played on AT tho
[8:04:37] Srenix: Marm had a level 72 rank1 Mutilate rogue
[8:04:43] body_type_two: but marm had on rogue priest mage druid forsure
[8:05:06] hes_mental: @body_type_two also warrior shammy warlock
[8:05:13] mr0hn0h3didnt: at have title for random shit its not the same as real rank 1
[8:05:37] mwako: it was worth more than blizzard servers back then
[8:05:43] mwako: mr0hn0h3didnt
[8:05:57] mr0hn0h3didnt: dont think so
[8:06:06] hes_mental: @mr0hn0h3didnt that settles it then
[8:06:10] kloperx: hydra and reckful had the most on a single class i think
[8:06:19] body_type_two: reckful was r1 on few classes aswell
[8:06:24] mwako: AT was like a bg with all the best players from everywhere
[8:06:38] body_type_two: @kloperx swapxy
[8:06:50] aakk122: fake taxi
[8:07:00] mr0hn0h3didnt: AT gave titles for tournament wins so u could easily stack titles on every class
[8:07:19] mr0hn0h3didnt: not to mention free full gear with vip
[8:07:32] hes_mental: whats ur point?
[8:07:34] mr0hn0h3didnt: for any class

[8:09:58] mr0hn0h3didnt: @hes_mental its not the same as real rank 1 is much more time consuming thats my point
[8:10:00] dereondra: THE TAUREN FEMALE
[8:10:16] lingxyz: @Ripper10 Savix, Guzu and Sodapoppin! Pepega
[8:10:23] mwako: time shouldn't be in the equation imo
[8:10:27] hes_mental: @mr0hn0h3didnt only difference is that seasons last longer on live
[8:10:42] dereondra: sexiest character model
[8:11:03] hes_mental: and why wouldnt u get a title for winning a tourney? tourney is basicaly a season speed run stacked with most competitive playuers
[8:11:04] mr0hn0h3didnt: @mwako it is tho, thats the game u play lol
[8:11:47] mwako: i thought we were talking about how legit AT r1 was compared to blizzard servers
[8:11:51] mwako: why would time matter
[8:11:57] mwako: its how good or bad they are no?
[8:12:07] mr0hn0h3didnt: when u got free vip and every class full gear with instant titles it’s obv way easier to stack rank 1s on other classes
[8:12:21] mr0hn0h3didnt: so its not comparable to retail players
[8:12:32] hes_mental: @mr0hn0h3didnt thats a cope
[8:12:42] mwako: marm got r1 w khuna and xandyn i think right before he started playing AT also
[8:12:43] mwako: as priest
[8:13:32] mr0hn0h3didnt: everyone has rank 1 on every class on at
[8:13:47] mwako: yeah but he got that on retail
[8:13:49] mwako: cata
[8:13:57] mwako: before playing AT
[8:14:12] mr0hn0h3didnt: ye but thats 1 class not 20
