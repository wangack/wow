[0:05:23] Skilten: I farmed these for 30 mins until I realized the rope was in my bank
[0:06:07] Skilten: its definitely not a bad drop rate

[0:11:11] Lunaatj: hydraT
[0:11:13] deltrexx: what do u think of exorcism -> divine holy shock crit -> exorcism -> holy shock (reset cd) is this viable enough for shockadin

[0:11:21] deltrexx: divine favor
[0:11:27] perseay797: And then? :D
[0:11:48] reggieface420: is that like 1500 damage in 4 globals
[0:11:57] reggieface420: normally that'd be sick but its kinda mediocre in sod
[0:12:27] reggieface420: at 40 ofc

[0:14:15] DnB_Junkee: sup all
[0:15:02] notJumu: they nerfed starsurge and mangle :O
[0:15:08] DnB_Junkee: whats that rare detection addon?
[0:15:10] Buglifeee: check it out
[0:15:13] Buglifeee: https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoothCalmSalamanderMVGame-3wx1lYd31ZUbrPIU
[0:15:19] reggieface420: hmm, u only actually get 50% of the crit that the talents say you do, like all the mage talents puts them to 225%, including the boot rune
[0:15:48] reggieface420: like shaman will go from 150->200
[0:16:08] notJumu: "Starsurge reduced to 30 yd range, down from 35 yd. Mangle (cat) reduced to 270% weapon damage, down from 300% weapon damage."
[0:16:41] reggieface420: they are wowhead datamines it seems
[0:16:55] perseay797: Proof in the chat LETSGO

[0:17:03] notJumu: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=407993/mangle
[0:17:18] notJumu: they didn't post about it, just updated tooltips
[0:17:45] daggerslife: it does not matter , starsurge needed that and it will still be 37 talented so its gorgeous
[0:17:46] daggerslife: :)
[0:17:49] reggieface420: the range is part of the problem with starsurge but starsurge is kinda overpowered in every single way
[0:17:57] reggieface420: it'll be 36 talented
[0:18:12] perseay797: They are nerfing ferals become they've become op LUL

[0:18:25] notJumu: mangle caught a stray bullet lmaoooo
[0:18:37] DnB_Junkee: ya, then ele shamans struggle with 15y shock range :D
[0:18:42] Itshighnoonwotlk: yo
[0:18:43] daggerslife: sure make it cost mana and lower damage but lower mana on everything else and boost damage on everything else
[0:18:50] reggieface420: i think they want you to press shred instead of spam mangles
[0:19:07] reggieface420: death-starsurge-lava burst are my top 3 "this is gonna be dumb" runes
[0:21:18] Macosqt: thanks, I just wanted to pass by lol
[0:21:22] Lunaatj: hydraKit
[0:21:24] daggerslife: also btw all druid spells needs to get low on mana and starsurge needs to have proper cost aswell
[0:21:50] PaEu: How much honor do u think is needed to get rank 3 in one week?
[0:22:36] Macosqt: killed me bro lol
[0:22:41] Macosqt: but is okay xD
[0:24:04] daggerslife: guys do u know around how much xp a  waylaid shipment would give ? a guy just showed me in discord 89 BOXES wtf
[0:24:33] Plushie__Tv: depends on the box's level, 1 gives 180, another gives 200 and the lowest rep gives like 120 or something
[0:24:45] reggieface420: even chain lightning with 200 sp, overload, 1500 damage on a single target, if a 2nd player shows up its 2500, if another shows up its 3100 LUL
[0:24:50] Plushie__Tv: thats with current rates according to staysafe but theres no confirmation if this will be increased
[0:24:53] daggerslife: what ??? only 200 per box  ?
[0:25:09] YesImFredTheBest: @daggerslife They said it would be increased next phase.
[0:25:13] weeedzygg: No way they would nerf druid a leave priest like that bro cmon
[0:25:15] hiraethonhs: 200 is not much tho
[0:25:31] Itshighnoonwotlk: who said 200 per box? kekL
[0:25:38] perseay797: 100 boxes = 20k
[0:25:49] YesImFredTheBest: Ye but imagine they increase it to 1k each
[0:25:54] Qtxo1: it is 200 for the top box average box is 180
[0:25:56] YesImFredTheBest: then it will start counting
[0:26:05] reggieface420: if the idea is that u can do all the quests and it doesn't brick ur char, ur gonna need a lot more than 25k bfd per 3 days to unbrick
[0:26:06] hiraethonhs: well I hope they're not dumb
[0:26:08] bigsugg: its 200 rep per box now
[0:26:09] YesImFredTheBest: They will increase it, but how much noone knows.
[0:26:12] hiraethonhs: they know players stack em
[0:26:31] daggerslife: yeah 1 k is good and its not so much  80k is like 2 levels and a half
[0:26:35] Plushie__Tv: no one knows if they will increase the exp on current boxes or just the new ones and how much the exp will be increased by
[0:26:43] hiraethonhs: 1k is too much
[0:26:49] hiraethonhs: like 400 max
[0:27:10] daggerslife: why Ryan its just 2-3 levels
[0:27:28] Studiovirtanen: !Guide
[0:27:29] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[0:27:29] bigsugg: they are playing the game when theyrestacking arent they
[0:27:33] reggieface420: they need a way to get people who did 100 quests at level 25 to get like level 30
[0:27:34] googlewooglex: you cant stack boxes?
[0:27:35] toonits: couldve prepped crazy aswell but chose to take the gold from quests instead
[0:27:37] reggieface420: how are they gonna do that
[0:27:44] reggieface420: u can stack completed boxes
[0:27:47] daggerslife: to be fair :) farming boxes takes so much more time than 3 marks
[0:27:51] daggerslife: and u have to complete with mats
[0:27:54] toonits: yuup
[0:27:57] Plushie__Tv: i have a slight feeling that the current boxes wont give any exp past honored since they give no rep past honored, this is my own thoughts though
[0:28:05] sickest__: !tierlist
[0:28:05] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPjLHVpiyU
[0:28:20] reggieface420: the new boxes will give a heavy amount of exp i'm sure because they'll need new mats
[0:28:31] Plushie__Tv: ^ is what i think too
[0:28:47] hiraethonhs: sounds good to me
[0:28:47] daggerslife: lord FAIRNESS
[0:28:48] daggerslife: :)
[0:28:55] daggerslife: god bless
[0:28:57] reggieface420: we had a guy in the guild who plays wsg for fun and he had 25-37 in his restore when it got wiped
[0:28:58] daggerslife: gold from pvp
[0:28:59] daggerslife: finally
[0:29:00] reggieface420: LUL
[0:29:04] Plushie__Tv: I havent farmed any boxes, it was tedious enough just getting honored with my priest and druid :P
[0:29:12] piouspectre: Yea pvpers need some dosh
[0:29:16] reggieface420: oh 28-37* not 25-37
[0:29:20] Shiwoon_TV: is it possible that i cant see your channel in discord with "just" prime subscribe?
[0:29:28] PaEu: like the supply things from TBC
[0:29:45] Shiwoon_TV: i did that :( will check again
[0:30:05] hiraethonhs: I dont mind those guys that no lifed for 100 box gets something from it tho but not much. One lvl up seems fair
[0:30:11] Plushie__Tv: should be up, I ran past the black cat during an event :)
[0:30:23] thickplumpyhippo: !tierlist
[0:30:23] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPjLHVpiyU
[0:30:32] Blackmanball: what's with the omega signs instead of names?
[0:30:45] bmkJR: if you're looking for shudumbra she spawns a bit more up the hill next to the house
[0:30:57] deltabreeze_2: frost mage with 150% crit damage is gonna be kinda crazy, ice lance will pump in pvp
[0:31:05] Sinostra: @Blackmanball that's because  of Hydra's omega braain
[0:31:23] Plushie__Tv: yeah she also goes up north where the deer stag women things are
[0:31:24] fizgaroth1: I know you probably get this question 1000 times per stream, but do you think it would be cool if they added arenas to SOD?
[0:31:38] thickplumpyhippo: !guide
[0:31:38] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[0:31:48] deltabreeze_2: @fizgaroth1 im pretty sure ive seen him answer this, no he doesnt want arenas
[0:31:54] deltabreeze_2: nvm, lol
[0:32:15] toonits: @deltabreeze_2 UHM
[0:32:31] elementixxx: and we will receive zero
[0:32:43] daggerslife: Its beyond me how after 20 years pvp still not sustain its own repairs and consumes, gold for marks is very good , 10-20 gold per day from playing pvp is good :)
[0:32:56] perseay797: Are you unhappy with the class balance right now?
[0:33:17] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[0:33:24] Itshighnoonwotlk: just ask viewers for gold
[0:33:27] elementixxx: they already told that nothing competitive because in such case they need to balance classes
[0:33:34] hiraethonhs: ye on of reasons I didnt pvp in p1 is cause of gold cost, I use few pots and that's 2G. Not worth
[0:33:52] hiraethonhs: go up the hill
[0:33:55] Blackmanball: it has a 15 min respawn timer
[0:34:00] bmkJR: @Hydramist it spawns up the hill next to the house
[0:34:06] Plushie__Tv: it patrols further up the road too
[0:34:17] hiraethonhs: left hill
[0:34:19] Plushie__Tv: north
[0:34:25] biddlybee: how do you have healing numbers showing?
[0:34:25] Plushie__Tv: up to the tree raynewood
[0:34:26] motod0x: it spawns at the north of that path
[0:34:27] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:34:28] motod0x: just sit there
[0:34:30] lund19: Fastest way to level from 20 to 25 in SoD? hardstuck on warr and not sure what to do now xd
[0:34:31] hiraethonhs: ye
[0:34:35] bmkJR: go all the way up the hill
[0:34:36] PaEu: Id love to see arenas in SOD. In TBC and wotlk meta was already solved. Sod arena would be completely now. But peopel would whine too much over balance issues i think
[0:34:41] bmkJR: and stay there it'll spawn
[0:34:42] Plushie__Tv: sort of wanders to the left up here
[0:35:46] perseay797: Are you okay with how powerful the priest currently is? In my opinion priests are overpowered in pve.
[0:35:46] bmkJR: yes
[0:35:48] perseay797: pvp*
[0:35:48] bigsugg: event bugged. zone bugged
[0:35:48] bmkJR: behind the house
[0:36:21] daggerslife: no way they do that to warriors hahahaha
[0:36:42] jimbonni: i sure SP going to pump in pvp but ar they going to pump in pve?
[0:36:58] hiraethonhs: why is default castbar still bugged for chanelled casts, they didn't fix it yet?
[0:37:05] mehdic_jt: Maybe im alone on this but i think arena would be really shit in SoD, i could see the appeal of a 1v1 thing you could do but arena 2/3/5 feels a bit pepega to me and probably wouldnt have that much interest from classic players
[0:37:24] ghostgalx: is there a possbility of shadow priests with pain supression? is that gonna be a thing?
[0:38:00] notJumu: Pain sup "Cannot be used while shapeshifted"
[0:38:10] DeathToad007: you saw starsurge is getting its range nerfed?
[0:38:11] notJumu: yes
[0:38:12] notJumu: it does
[0:38:23] notJumu: yes
[0:38:30] hiraethonhs: why would they write it if it wasnt shapeshift
[0:38:31] notJumu: penance cant be cast while shapeshifted
[0:40:02] hiraethonhs: if Blizz was smart they would focus on sod
[0:40:20] motod0x: sit here
[0:40:22] motod0x: where you are atm
[0:40:26] motod0x: this is where it spawns
[0:40:43] ghostgalx: yes, theres a comment on wowhead of someone mentioning the cat despawning infront of him when event started
[0:41:06] hiraethonhs: I think it would be smart move to cancel Cataclysm crap and focus more on sod
[0:41:13] notJumu: that's if u get unlucky and layers collapse
[0:41:34] perseay797: Especially when they fired 1800 blizzard employees
[0:41:37] mehdic_jt: cataclysm will be a waste of time it might be arguably the worst expansion they ever put out
[0:41:46] 0b1jacobi: !Guide

[0:41:48] Baxxtah: just cancel DF, fakn garbage
[0:41:49] perseay797: I'm kinda worried of the quality and quaantitiy of content we would get
[0:42:14] ghostgalx: "So apparently he despawns when the Ashenvale PvP event starts on Season of Discovery realms.. got him to 50% then event started and he vanished."

[0:42:21] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPjLHVpiyU
[0:42:22] Baxxtah: Problem is PvE in cata is top tier..
[0:42:26] ghostgalx: It was the bear, but i guess it applies to the cat as well
[0:42:37] lund19: @Hydramist 80% of player base will quit in cata for sure, game is too hard
[0:42:45] hiraethonhs: I can see so many options for SoD, like new sod season when they cycle new spells/items raids. So many possibilites
[0:42:50] deltabreeze_2: reputation wise, I think people know what to expect with it so if it sucks its whatever.
[0:42:51] magickdoge: Cata's gonna a be a trainwreck
[0:43:30] Itshighnoonwotlk: go for the harvester instead, its only 24 hr respawn timer
[0:43:33] Sinostra: am i the only one here who actually enjoyed cata ?
[0:43:37] Shiwoon_TV: now it worked! (Twitch + Discord Channel) i'm just dumb :) used my old Twitch Account...
[0:43:44] hiraethonhs: make /target macro it's easier
[0:43:47] elementixxx: cata is still better them boomies with insta button for 500 dmg for 10 mana
[0:43:57] Itshighnoonwotlk: actually ultra rare kekL

[0:44:46] biddlybee: the weapons from last boss in dragon soul were quite fun
[0:44:52] perseay797: Cata was the beginning of the end. Ridding off talent trees is a massive hit to what WoW is loved for.
[0:44:56] biddlybee: just getting ripped in pvp because a warrior proc'd 3 tentacles from his weap
[0:44:57] deltabreeze_2: is ice barrier better than pws for self buffing?
[0:45:02] Baxxtah: all that matters in SoD is how it is at 60, everyting till then can be meme city for all i care
[0:45:17] motod0x: how are you on a layer when the event isnt being done lol
[0:45:52] hiraethonhs: its bugged
[0:45:54] hiraethonhs: event
[0:45:56] hiraethonhs: probly
[0:46:05] Sinostra: yeah, but questing isn't the best experience in the game tbh
[0:47:25] vrsswow: Sup bro....hello every one
[0:47:35] perseay797: Any preppers in chat? KKona
[0:47:37] Itshighnoonwotlk: whole point of sod is playing each phase, 60 is gonna be a at late summer @ baxxtah

[0:49:09] lund19: Gotta love the good old MLD in cata
[0:49:14] fafoo204: hunter players like cata
[0:49:18] hiraethonhs: @Itshighnoonwotlk late summer? you mean summer 2025?
[0:49:42] HyperexTV: Like WLD
[0:49:56] Itshighnoonwotlk: @hiraethonhs there is a roadmap for all upcoming expansions including SOD if u want a link
[0:50:40] hiraethonhs: yeah I saw it but I really doubt they will keep to those timeline, they will say they lost a lot of ppl blabla @Itshighnoonwotlk
[0:50:49] Manzugs: do you think sod will have new classes or remain classic

[0:51:09] daggerslife: everyone i know who played back then lost like 80 % of his mates exactly at that expansion including me
[0:51:10] fafoo204: def not any new clsses
[0:51:13] daggerslife: fk cata
[0:51:20] Itshighnoonwotlk: yeah bring dks into sod LOL
[0:51:29] Manzugs: bring dhs in lmao
[0:51:31] hiraethonhs: i stopped at cata, they destroyed my lock lol
[0:51:31] perseay797: Hydra can you elaborate a little bit why TBC classic wasn't popular and died so fast? @Hydramist I missed that time but i' kinda hungry for TBC.
[0:51:32] Sinostra: to me, mop was the shitty expansion
[0:51:45] damnzy: also around cata league was going hard af
[0:52:08] texa69: cata pvp is superior to wotlk pvp, there's nothing that can change my mind
[0:52:13] lund19: Main problem with cata is pve, most people dont even pvp anyway
[0:52:21] lund19: people could hardly do hc dungeons
[0:52:22] Manzugs: which classic client would have the most pop?
[0:52:25] Itshighnoonwotlk: @hiraethonhs yeah, but i dont think they will delay it for another year. they are masters at stalling, but not that long xd
[0:52:27] fafoo204: i had good times in mop
[0:52:40] elementixxx: mop was great because no pve for pvp
[0:52:52] choptopyo: cata still much better than mop wod legion bfa shadowlands dragonflight :D
[0:53:10] vrsswow: Cata pvp 3v3 Hydra Braindeadly and Jimos was HILARIOUUUUUSSSS
[0:53:17] fafoo204: i would def play mop classic a bit
[0:53:17] perseay797: BASED
[0:53:17] daggerslife: actually they can do something about SOD PVP.  Give gold for marks as Ryan said and also give me replica gear vendor
[0:53:29] biddlybee: ok, where can we message Ziqo then?? xD
[0:53:32] Manzugs: @Hydramist is SOD the most populated classic client?
[0:53:34] daggerslife: basically current raid gear for gold per piece  but replic " not working outside pvp "
[0:53:37] lund19: Oh god what was the name of the feral druid yelling TRANQUILITY?
[0:53:55] hiraethonhs: They should also add more pvp gear

[1:57:59] Kyfoon: oh haha

[1:59:40] jcurt03: U see people are saying base range on SS is gonna be 30yds?
[1:59:41] hiraethonhs: i think u can get 40 just by doing some dungeons and STV
[1:59:43] Istunlocklocalpensioners: do you find SOD levelling tedious asf
[2:00:00] gratzitko: theres more leveling then just dungeons and questing
[2:00:10] Oldschoollol: Oldschoollol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 78 months! hydraCreep
[2:00:15] NeVolent: @jcurt03 legit?
[2:00:24] varatupaj: the sould put mana cost on ss
[2:00:35] CreasesPieces: runes is leveling with roids
[2:00:39] gratzitko: @jcurt03 where do u see this at. is it confirmed
[2:00:43] Oldschoollol: good good, long day, but was fine. And yours?
[2:00:52] hiraethonhs: tbh Blizzard locking out ally on living flame was best move they did
[2:00:56] hiraethonhs: else it would be 70% ally rn
[2:01:06] varatupaj: range would be fine if you cant spam it for free
[2:01:17] theEntropie: Not even mana cost, just cut the range to 25-30 yards
[2:01:58] ediblemaster: !guide
[2:01:58] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[2:01:59] Kyfoon: yep
[2:02:03] gratzitko: people complaining about boomkins just need to stop, nerfing starsurge makes the class 100% completly useless again. theyre literally fine
[2:02:13] bmkJR: xd?
[2:02:17] hiraethonhs: starsurge is broken
[2:02:18] ediblemaster: hydra ur a life hack for me as a priest main, love and appreciate the work bro
[2:02:23] theEntropie: I can normally fight boomies on mage or priest in close range no problem, the issue is when I get a meteor strike from 10000 miles away
[2:03:03] gratzitko: starsurge is fine imo.....it literally hits for like 250 dmg  and they do 0 dmg outside of that. i dont even play boomkin and i dont find them to be a problem at all

[2:03:20] Istunlocklocalpensioners: but it makes it fun
[2:03:21] EpShade: @gratzitko it hits for around 500
[2:03:24] theEntropie: @gratzitko yeah dmg and cost are fine imo but for me the range is absurd
[2:03:33] cheetobbob: star surge does not need to be nerfed 1 bit
[2:03:37] gratzitko: it does NOT hit for 500 lmao, maybe ur talking about a crit, which is exztresmly rare
[2:03:45] Chrosis: @gratzitko There is no counterplay to it at all. It's a 1 button, 8 second cooldown that cannot be stopped and does 20-25% of your hp bar
[2:03:47] NeVolent: @gratzitko not true... they do 300 dmg with ss and when is vs caster they spam swrath that hit for 150-160 each 1.5 sec veeeery fast cast
[2:03:54] Itshighnoonwotlk: those bags are madness, wheres bagnon x)
[2:04:08] hiraethonhs: guys only way to live starsurge spam is if u have like 1.5k hp
[2:04:11] hiraethonhs: or healing
[2:04:16] hiraethonhs: if ur non healing class ur fucked

[2:04:24] ronke420: DUDE .... ahahhah we have same amount of gold lol
[2:04:26] gratzitko: it hits for 250 dmg. if you have 1400 hp which most people do, sometimes more, its gonna take like 6-7 surges to kill u lol. 40 seconds
[2:04:33] bmkJR: even if ure healing class u go oom lmfao
[2:04:36] potnis__: i have biss gear on my druid, in pvp i can crit some time 450-500 with bfd buff and berserk
[2:04:37] cheetobbob: it does not hit for 300-350 full bis
[2:04:44] ronke420: ltrly have 31g 31s
[2:04:50] NeVolent: Wrath also gets 70% pushback now so they can totaly spam warths in ur face while  they tank ur dmg with Wild growth
[2:04:55] cheetobbob: it hits for 225-275 bis gear non crit
[2:05:01] slarenoff: deadly blunderbuss
[2:05:05] gratzitko: @cheetobbob yepo
[2:05:07] gratzitko: no
[2:05:18] SirPadfoot: i'm asking myself if we should hand in green quests before getting into bfd
[2:05:21] NeVolent: dude i have druid not even bis and hit for 300
[2:05:28] NeVolent: and 150-160 wraths
[2:05:45] gratzitko: rogues open on a druid and kill them in 2 seconds
[2:05:50] NeVolent: maybe u play vs undergeared boomies
[2:05:51] bassiemon123: Ur wrath still hitting harder then my lb rank 4 xd
[2:05:53] cheetobbob: I’m full bis and I haven’t seen a 300
[2:05:54] gratzitko: boomies r fine man lol
[2:05:56] NeVolent: lol
[2:06:04] NeVolent: never seen boomie lose to rogue in duels or any tournament happened
[2:06:19] gratzitko: yeah because a duel tourny is diff when every1 is stacking stam vs rogues
[2:06:22] gratzitko: ur not doing that in the open world
[2:06:23] NeVolent: saw 2 tournaments where bobka was playing and was losing to boomies
[2:06:25] potnis__: rogues are easy on druid, if u have wild growth
[2:06:42] gratzitko: rogue shits on boomy in open world, it only wins in a duel tourney where a boomy stacks stam
[2:06:52] gratzitko: but most boomies run with 1k hp, and + arcane dmg, so they get shreded by a rogue
[2:06:53] NeVolent: stacking stamina? boomies dont stack stamina they stack MANA so they spam Wild growth
[2:07:07] gratzitko: in duel tourneys no they def stack stamina vsd rogues kekw
[2:07:07] Synckery: what we thinking about arms going into the next patch, thinking of rerolling off lock cus lock feels underwhelming
[2:07:09] gratzitko: tf r u talking about
[2:07:20] NeVolent: the fk u are talkin about u are clueless
[2:07:28] hiraethonhs: are u on living flame on this priest hydra

[3:13:25] Itrulia: just got ganked by a 4 boomie and 2 rogue squad in hillsbrad
[3:13:32] Itrulia: just trying to quest on my alt
[3:13:39] HeyImArty: these are the people that will get 1v3'd in later phases by ppl using stuff like rocket helm
[3:13:40] Distorpia: or rogues
[3:13:54] Itrulia: @HeyImArty horde can get rocket helm in p2 KEKW
[3:13:55] aerodynam1c: tell it to my 40 energy mutilate
[3:13:58] hot5and7: fk grps
[3:14:00] Distorpia: but we still gotta quest
[3:14:06] tme_meteors: bis 5 man comp?
[3:14:07] Lunaatj: You have the choice of gaining no currency, or reduced currency cause you need to be grouped.
[3:14:19] cryptomeganinja: rogue gonna steal killing blows with ambush
[3:14:23] Distorpia: imagine trying to quest on 3rd-5th alt weeks from now, gonna be painful
[3:14:37] cryptomeganinja: true
[3:14:41] acaciashrub: swd go brrr
[3:14:41] HeyImArty: @Itrulia horde can?
[3:14:44] prodigy_wow: Shadow word death easy $
[3:15:02] Itrulia: @HeyImArty boss in uldaman drops lv 40 plate helmet that does the same as rocket helm
[3:15:03] aerodynam1c: imagine tagging a friend on another faction and no one attacks them while running through the zone lol
[3:15:05] Distorpia: i really hope the penalty for raid size groups isn't something mild
[3:15:31] HeyImArty: @Itrulia ah ye but thats only warrior
[3:15:36] HeyImArty: who cares about warriors, they arent people
[3:15:43] Distorpia: get a layer quick
[3:16:04] aerodynam1c: PepeLaugh
[3:16:09] HeyImArty: how dumbs hunter gonna be with beastial wrath
[3:16:21] Lemon_Farmer1: Yo hydra, you got a link to the talents you'll use to level?
[3:16:26] cyanne112: i understand you are content creator and you need... content, but not letting ppl group up is the wrong thing to do in a mmo. Tbh the game isnt fun / interesting enough to play without friends
[3:16:39] HeyImArty: its never just a hunter brother
[3:16:45] cryptomeganinja: close
[3:16:50] aerodynam1c: awkward silence in his group noow
[3:16:59] HeyImArty: ofc he cant 1v1, he sat there with cheetah on getting meleed by homies
[3:16:59] prodigy_wow: games too tricky LUL LUL
[3:17:02] HeyImArty: dented as fuck
[3:17:56] hot5and7: true. it's dumb
[3:18:14] cyanne112: my point wasnt specifically about you, but the entire event
[3:18:18] prodigy_wow: True
[3:18:31] cyanne112: the way they set it up is just... bad

[3:18:55] hiraethonhs: I already see a way to grief in event, come with 10 ppl and make 2 groups and dont kill each other
[3:19:35] fakemejo: fakemejo watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! sod hype sod hype
[3:19:37] hiraethonhs: well rogues and hunters might go solo tbh and get free kills
[3:19:41] belz_ks: 4priest/1 warrior groups
[3:19:44] justingatlin: @Hydramist you should get more rep when u gonna farm alone/without group when u kill someone
[3:19:45] prodigy_wow: It should be full ffa no groups
[3:19:47] morvious: Do you think Shadow will be strong in pve phase 2?
[3:19:48] hiraethonhs: druids*
[3:20:02] screwu666: hello
[3:20:49] VONDAVVE: 5v5 is just chaotic, 2v2 or 3v3 makes it alot more interesting even in wpvp
[3:21:08] xz6969: Yo hydra you excited for shadow p2?
[3:21:47] prodigy_wow: That would be super fun
[3:22:13] hiraethonhs: i will probly go solo with my rogue and find 5m with hunter in event
[3:22:47] xz6969: Warrior could be opressive af with warbringer charge/intercept + shockadin freedoms
[3:22:53] sulltan95: lets hope they add a debuff the higher group you are in u receive % less healing and dmg and hp
[3:23:00] sulltan95: that makes smaller grps stronger

[3:24:27] xz6969: tbh making a group to kill my guildies sounds hilarious
[3:25:04] Distorpia: there's no pvp etiquette anymore
[3:25:05] Distorpia: kinda sadge
[3:25:12] xz6969: some classes are just fkin horrible solo tho
[3:25:13] plowgod: fuckin cats i swear
[3:25:14] HeyImArty: Cat causing mayhem? hydraKit
[3:25:25] screwu666: i'll be going in and dying, but i'll always try to at least take one mf8cker with me
[3:25:44] morvious: Shadow really misses a crit dmg talent that other casters have
[3:26:12] Distorpia: with the starsurge changes , do you reckon balance is still going to be S tier ?
[3:26:15] screwu666: shadow also misses a travel form and a blink
[3:26:22] cryptomeganinja: there are rumors, that bigger grp will have decreased stats/movementspeed
[3:26:26] HeyImArty: boomies getting 100% more crit dmg on Starsurge
[3:26:29] HeyImArty: gonna be something
[3:26:29] cryptomeganinja: like 5% for each player
[3:26:35] tick1en1pple: How do you think shadow is looking for 4O hydra?

[3:30:31] KungKotz: do you like underground techno?
[3:30:37] HeyImArty: i hate starsurge, its made druid pvp completely braindead
[3:30:39] dreeeamyy: Good evening o/
[3:31:06] fakemejo: when is rogue lvl 25?
[3:31:08] fakemejo: Kappa
[3:31:56] xz6969: Dots critting is kinda hype tho
[3:32:03] xz6969: dunno if thts next phase
[3:32:04] xz6969: yeah
[3:32:06] dreeeamyy: if he is mm he has 41yd range
[3:32:35] fourkgaming: starsurge is the reason why pvp sucks atm
[3:32:40] fourkgaming: and hunter pets
[3:32:48] dreeeamyy: care with the imp concussion 20% stun
[3:32:58] cryptomeganinja: hunter pets will get nerfed again, but lone wolf will get buffed
[3:33:03] cryptomeganinja: 20%
[3:33:15] prodigy_wow: p2 they will all be melee hunters lol
[3:33:23] HeyImArty: issue is playing lone wolf would require more than 8 braincells
[3:33:26] hiraethonhs: 30% lone wolf sux
[3:33:26] HeyImArty: so the avg hunter cant do it
[3:33:30] cryptomeganinja: lone wolf is scary, also now. but many hunter dont play it
[3:33:35] Dodie324: Do the homies have a mind of their own? I don't understand their algo
[3:33:37] hiraethonhs: they need to make it like 50% to be even worth it
[3:34:03] cyanne112: LW sucks because you lose 20% stats
[3:34:06] darkstarklife: Hunters in general HATE LONEWOLF

[3:34:20] Distorpia: felguard soon SeemsGood
[3:34:21] dreeeamyy: Lone wolf = lose Lion buff
[3:34:28] JustOndore: Maybe remove dead zone from lonewolf
[3:34:30] Itrulia: remember lion should have been belt until redditors wined
[3:34:31] cyanne112: and even if they buffed LW to the sky pets have way to much utility in pvp
[3:34:36] Itrulia: which destroyed hunter build diversity
[3:34:41] funkrosin: + having a pet that brings util is part of the class
[3:34:52] shmokes_: true
[3:35:04] HeyImArty: unless i hibernate the pet now i die to a hunter desptie deadzoning him
[3:35:10] HeyImArty: because the pet is dumb
[3:35:12] dreeeamyy: @hydramist i went MM and smashed people in world pvp
[3:35:13] funkrosin: and pet micro is a way to express skill on hunter
[3:35:15] jgagel1: once leather + has MC gear or better hunter pets really dont do much
[3:35:17] dreeeamyy: with chimera shot
[3:35:29] dreeeamyy: altho im very geared
[3:35:30] KungKotz: found a sick tune you may like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDLZspHvE4U
[3:35:32] hiraethonhs: it's kind sadge that ppl try to balance game around lvl 25 tho, hunter will get overnerfed and useless max lvl
[3:35:42] dreeeamyy: Yeah true
[3:35:55] HeyImArty: @hiraethonhs imagine if it wasnt a small company that had the ability to tune stuff based on the current phase
[3:36:35] dreeeamyy: i hope they dont do too much, it cant get to far away from ”real” Vanilla
[3:36:46] hiraethonhs: hunter is like worst scaling class in classic, traps dont scale and sting doesnt scale
[3:36:49] cyanne112: btw hunter pet dmg is around 25% atm in pve, they really dont do THAT much dmg, it;s less than tbc for example
[3:36:58] jeffapriest: !tierlist
[3:36:58] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPjLHVpiyU
[3:37:05] hiraethonhs: i mean fire traps

[3:37:11] HeyImArty: who cares about the fire traps
[3:37:18] cyanne112: its jsut how hunters scales in classic
[3:37:24] hiraethonhs: ye talking about pve mostly
[3:37:38] HeyImArty: eh classic pvp is a meme
[3:37:46] hiraethonhs: rn my pet does like 30% overall dmg in raids

[3:40:39] HeyImArty: Dungeons only worth if you have 4 other actually good players
[3:40:40] bassiemon123: Mount cost reduced

[3:40:42] Retsubabe: @Pixiieboy this guy gets it

[3:41:24] HeyImArty: Will Ryan have gold for mount at 40? find out on the next episode
[3:41:34] bassiemon123: @retsubabe lvling to 40 should give u plenty of gold
[3:41:35] fsu_brooklyn: yea, same
[3:41:40] darkstarklife: i just made 200+ g passed 2 days due to some pre phase fixes in the AH
[3:41:45] JavaSkrpt: What gets a 9-10 on the fun rating?
[3:41:49] fsu_brooklyn: think next phase will be the best one tbh
[3:41:52] KungKotz: you know why I like Chaos Bolt, I actually remember people I see, I meet them again, my KoS list actually make sense
[3:41:53] HunterEZ: BBoomer
[3:41:53] JavaSkrpt: Or a 6 or lower
[3:41:55] ama__deus: I usually have like 5g at 30, then still always make the 100g for the mount at 40. It'll be chill
[3:42:19] HeyImArty: im on 208g total and i think thats more than enough, the only expensive will be consumes & enchants
[3:42:26] Leon81094: price for mount is halved in sod

[3:42:33] HeyImArty: expenses*
[3:42:41] tme_meteors: Closest thing I've had to a 10 were some WoW pservers. Those went crazy back in the day
[3:42:54] misstherese: same
[3:42:54] ama__deus: Vanilla was a solid 9 for sure
[3:42:56] Chazzmichael: I know what you aRe talking about
[3:42:58] screwu666: wow classic and cs1.6
[3:42:59] callie5: Same, it was on another lv when it first came out
[3:43:02] HeyImArty: where does TBC classic land, you played the shit out of TBC classic
[3:43:02] jgagel1: that feeling is long gone but i remember the thought process
[3:43:04] Retsubabe: I enjoyed wrath a lot
[3:43:11] prodigy_wow: Making arena team names was something special in TBC
[3:43:16] Drunk_Mantis: i'll never forget playing the original wow vanilla beta back in early 2000s
[3:43:16] Retsubabe: s8 could have gone forever
[3:43:18] KungKotz: But that's also cuz it was "new"
[3:43:21] nilsolof123: and what point u give SoD?
[3:43:22] dreeeamyy: @hydramist the original wow, back in 2004 is the closest to a 10 ive ever experienced
[3:43:25] Victwitch: I was there in 2004 closed beta WoW, 10/10 experience!
[3:43:28] HunterEZ: Nothing beats warlords of draenor
[3:43:31] cyanne112: Just a question to put your rating into perspective, did you play any other MMO before vanilla wow?
[3:43:36] Deftvx: You know whats crazy to me is how they even fkn created vanilla wow, all the quests/mobs/details, so well, IN 2006
[3:43:36] JavaSkrpt: That's not bad, then.
[3:43:42] EpShade: too early to rate sod tho
[3:43:45] notJumu: I've had 3x 9s in my life and they were all when i was a kid so i guess nostalgia is a helluva drug
[3:43:45] HunterEZ: Remember back in the days when u sat there and waited for WOD
[3:43:45] tme_meteors: SoD is sick but I just cannot stand not having resil and ooming after 1 ability
[3:43:47] Retsubabe: favorite season? mine would be season 8
[3:43:48] EpShade: could go up or down easily
[3:43:49] HunterEZ: it was the best expansion ever
[3:43:50] ama__deus: Tentatively excited for this whole Classic+ experiment, because SOD has been fun so far, but we'll see
[3:43:55] fakemejo: Dragonflight 3,5 / 10
[3:43:58] JavaSkrpt: Retail is about a 2-3 to me, it's like the opposite of what I think is enjoyable.

[3:44:37] Chazzmichael: Running deadmines on my human Paladin until the mobs were gray. And then eventually ended up in desolace killing chimaeras for like 3 levels with no clue at all about what I Was doing
[3:44:41] KungKotz: SWTOR was kinda nice
[3:44:57] ama__deus: Add CS to that and same, yeah
[3:45:22] KungKotz: wow today is like that ex gf that you KNOW you wont go Full time with but you just cant let her go fully

[3:45:32] dreeeamyy: i never tried it
[3:45:35] hiraethonhs: lol anyone rememebers Wildstar hype :D
[3:45:36] Retsubabe: which was your favorite pvp season? I loved season 8 as priest (because of mates at the time I think)
[3:45:36] ama__deus: Lost my team a CS LAN final, because someone gave me a WoW beta key to log into and I was addicted af playing it there LUL
[3:46:14] KungKotz: damp not safe to del
[3:46:19] cryptomeganinja: <3 sod
[3:46:19] HunterEZ: There is only one game that was compareable and that was everquest
[3:46:34] KungKotz: if you got the quest from damp not then you can del it
[3:46:36] ama__deus: Too young for Everquest Sadge
[3:47:01] notJumu: 2/5 imo
[3:47:06] HunterEZ: runescape is like it's own entire type of MMO but it's still a good game
[3:47:08] ama__deus: Original GW apparently would have been great, but didn't get into that due to still riding that WoW high then LUL
[3:47:14] notJumu: maybe only 1/5
[3:47:26] hot5and7: best spec for dungeon levelling?
[3:47:28] notJumu: ohhhh my bad
[3:47:32] notJumu: thought for same level
[3:48:04] greatywhite_: hopefully they add a barber
[3:48:13] ama__deus: Spirit tap worth for dungeon leveling? 🤔
[3:48:24] notJumu: @greatywhite_ lmao shobek would be in shambles
[3:48:26] Drumme13: How do you know that STV will be everyone vs. everyone and not faction vs. faction?
[3:48:37] ama__deus: I kind of like that spirit tap snipe gameplay in dungeons
[3:48:42] hiraethonhs: lol
[3:48:42] HeyImArty: has there been any word on the supposed priest racial changing thing
[3:48:45] HunterEZ: They should add a plastic surgeon to the game so u can swap gender
[3:48:59] notJumu: 6 hour barber stream is the plan
[3:49:06] ama__deus: @HunterEZ barber usually let you do that actually LUL
[3:49:16] HunterEZ: Barber cuts ur peepee Keepo
[3:49:24] JavaSkrpt: Wish my wife could cut my hair and not butcher it
[3:49:47] ama__deus: @javaskrpt why, though?
[3:50:11] HunterEZ: 1. its cheaper 2.no need for booking
[3:50:13] HunterEZ: WDYM
[3:50:22] yucknothanks: @Hydramist quick TLDR of what I should be doing for the SoD p2 prep
[3:50:30] JavaSkrpt: No barbers nearby that I'd get the snippity snip from
[3:50:31] ama__deus: I mean it's 20 quid every 2 months or so eShrug
[3:50:41] HunterEZ: 20 quid mad cheap lmao
[3:50:41] JavaSkrpt: Waitlists for those I would

[6:27:38] hntb100: they should not only include set tokens, which they already did. but also some kind of currency where you can just buy an item from bfd. So you dont have to farm the raid for 1 item the whole phase
[6:27:39] dreeeamyy: Kinda fun there are alot of contenders in terms of class/spec

[6:37:38] saund: GDKP banned for next tourney, making every raid lockout trivial, gonna be interesting seeing some in good gear others not so much @Hydramist
[6:38:24] saund: people like Bobka and SONII are gm's
[6:38:24] dreeeamyy: What about restricting it to all greens or somth
[6:38:25] dreeeamyy: gearwise
[6:38:27] saund: so they got it easy

[6:40:47] jasonsoo2010: snutz gonna win again if there is cdl tourney, i hope meta is ban for the tournament .
[6:41:25] HeyImArty: i dont think locks will be some type of 1v1 god at 40
[6:41:28] HeyImArty: no deathcoil is rough af
[6:41:53] HeyImArty: its fine they get UA in p3 and the game is over and we all uninstall

[8:43:48] PlayerOneFifty: will the wand be useless at 40?
[8:44:19] Sinostra: there's gonna be a new enchant wand btw
[8:45:05] perseay797: Yeah. Very minor increase. Let's say you do 200dps as SP in P2. With Vampiric Embrace you'll output 40 hps not including overhealing. 1 point impoved will get you from 40 hps to 50 hps. 2 Points will get you from 40 hps to 60 hps. But your job is to do damage,  not heal.

[8:45:21] barcode97: @Hydramist what is better in your eyes in P2 rogue or balance
[8:45:29] bomzzwtf: I love the healing numbers from vampiric
[8:45:35] Amoxychillen: would like to see blizz make a change where wand continues its relative power level?
[8:45:36] barcode97: yes pvp
[8:45:45] bomzzwtf: When u crit that mindblast
[8:45:56] perseay797: For pvp is even worse coz you' don't do stable 200 dps LUL:
[8:45:59] perseay797: LUL
[8:46:27] Amoxychillen: Every 10th wand hit causes a stun
[8:46:32] Amoxychillen: would be cool
[8:46:45] nosugrr: you can still heal from dots in disperse though right
[8:47:17] bomzzwtf: Dispers isnt 40 tho right?
[8:47:34] boogy1001: @Hydramist u going for first lvl 40 priest?
[8:47:39] bomzzwtf: oh i thought it was only mindspike and ps
[8:48:33] perseay797: Did you see that they reduced mana cost for shadow spells in Shadow form by 100%. Tooltip for Shadow form changed on wowhead.  I'm sure they'll not do 100%, they are most likely testing how SP will work, but it's a good sign they're working on mana issues. @Hydramist
[8:49:20] bomzzwtf: mb mb
[8:50:01] bomzzwtf: @boogy1001 not sure u can unless you do dungeons with many mages

[9:01:02] Mapsize_: had to refresh my memory, found this
[9:01:03] Mapsize_: One Lucky Red Envelope will be sent to your mailbox for every Elder throughout Azeroth you talk to. It can contain one of two items: Lucky Rocket Cluster or Elder's Moonstone. Use the rocket near a launcher and you will receive a +250 health buff that will last for 30 minutes! Engineers can create the launcher with Schematic: Cluster Launcher so you're able to get the buff all year around.
[9:01:04] Pixiepantss: awe kitty! softpawBongotap
[9:01:43] Mapsize_: no you can make the launcher, but you need the drops from envelopes
[9:01:45] bomzzwtf: in p3?
[9:01:52] Pixiepantss: AWEE QQQ
[9:01:57] bomzzwtf: profession cap is 225 isnt it
[9:02:12] Mapsize_: correct afaik
[9:02:22] Mapsize_: thats why you sweat out all the eldercoins
[9:02:24] bomzzwtf: You can just buy 200 rockets from vendor and bank them?
[9:02:26] Mapsize_: at lunarfestival
[9:02:47] nosugrr: @Mapsize_ is it 50% chance from envelopes?
[9:03:00] Mapsize_: @nosugrr yea
[9:03:09] xiuhx: we used it in SoM in BWL and it was only in the event.
[9:03:16] Mapsize_: you get an envelope in your mail per collected coin
[9:03:46] bomzzwtf: But it says engineering 225 on the rockets, so that means its craftable somehow
[9:03:50] Mapsize_: check this  https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=21746/lucky-red-envelope
[9:04:09] Mapsize_: you get one envelope per coing you have collected
[9:04:12] Mapsize_: in the mail
