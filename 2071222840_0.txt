[1:37:55] matgr1993: Shadow word death nerfed guys, PVP Is saved.. Meanwhile the pvp :
[1:38:02] SneakyBeaverr: @Ryxom it does in SoD
[1:38:14] JohnSpecter: EZ
[1:40:36] DaaamnTV: ranged attack power does and stamina
[1:40:45] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: ofc it does lol
[1:41:09] Prohx: get a lion/tiger with dash and prowl, it will stealth up to them and demolish!
[1:41:23] grubols: well I wouldn’t say ofc it makes no sense but it does 😂
[1:41:24] Sqwibbie: im going to post my wrong thought like a fact in chat..
[1:41:37] ShinerG: hunter
[1:41:42] ShinerG: druids are still ass in pvp
[1:41:43] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: isnt Broketooth the best ?
[1:41:45] ShinerG: its Sadge
[1:41:59] Sqwibbie: druid is not ass in pvp lol
[1:42:17] mr_az3k: 1aps
[1:42:25] mr_az3k: ruins casters
[1:42:26] Anhov: broken tooth is good for pure ranged hunter
[1:42:26] douchebageo: fastest attack
[1:42:26] Not_A_Muggle: brokentooth is the best for pvp
[1:42:28] Kaggenone: 1 in attac kspeed
[1:42:28] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: cause he asa the fastest attac speed
[1:42:33] TigbittiesXXL: pretty sure its the atk speed
[1:42:41] vbx93: i like how traps insta trigger here on SOD while Homerjay is still malding KEKW
[1:42:42] letsgetgoingyo: brokentoth is 1.0 speed. It increases spell pushback in pvp. But its not good for pve
[1:42:43] Kaggenone: not in pvp
[1:42:44] ObrezKnight: WHAT ABOUT that named white tiger from stv?
[1:42:47] Jaxuslol: he is good in pvp 1.0 aaattack speed
[1:42:48] Prohx: they have the same dps. Broken tooth has 1sec speed that is nice for pushback. Eche has 2 second atk speed, and that is better if u use Flanking Strike @Ziqoftw
[1:43:06] booddhi: its not bad
[1:43:20] Kaggenone: why is it bad? :O
[1:43:33] nitromethane_: imo its good for pvp BM, faster frenzy proc + pushback. sure your FS wont hit as hard, as MM I´d go with 2.0
[1:43:41] Hamsandwich37: Good afternoon Ziqo! Jammies
[1:44:06] Anhov: people barely cast in sod anyway
[1:44:06] Jaxuslol: your flanking strike hits harder with 1 2.0 AS
[1:44:13] nitromethane_: the damage is the same 1.00 / 2.00 (difference is frenzy procs and FS doing less damage with 1.00)
[1:44:16] letsgetgoingyo: it will do the same DPS, but 2.0 is more bursty and flanking hits harder
[1:44:20] DaaamnTV: so many mages in sod pvp u need spell pushback
[1:44:34] shykuar: true
[1:44:46] timzu: why is it best with slow attack speed?
[1:45:18] booddhi: if the pet is being kited or cc'd the moment it hits it will do more dmg
[1:45:23] ControversyTV: spellpushback is the objective
[1:45:32] vbx93: as bm you kinda have uptime though
[1:45:45] SneakyBeaverr: SusgeNote
[1:45:48] Sqwibbie: PepoG
[1:46:15] lfkappachupa: picaso
[1:46:18] prodigy_wow: The chat Loves MS Paint

[1:46:22] ShinerG: HUH
[1:46:22] TigbittiesXXL: good boy
[1:46:25] k0kicata: thats legolass
[1:46:26] Zhilex: pepePaint
[1:46:27] Hamsandwich37: is that Pablo Picasso Pog
[1:46:30] Sqwibbie: SNIFFA
[1:46:33] SneakyBeaverr: SMALLBIRD
[1:46:33] fibriz1: this is sick
[1:46:35] shykuar: FeelsDankMan
[1:46:35] nitromethane_: reason to 1.00 is not just pusback, its frenzy procs from BM talents
[1:46:37] ControversyTV: i love ziqo drawing classes
[1:46:44] swayylol: Nft GlitchNRG
[1:46:49] rafaeljy: you should be an artist instead of a streamer!
[1:47:00] linkens_here: you better be making that into a   shirt design and selling it on your merch store
[1:47:10] Rambomodez: @rafaeljy +1
[1:47:11] gary111111: it's simple really 5Head
[1:47:11] QwQGolden: You will ALL be tested on this at the end of the year, better be taking PepoG
[1:47:15] lfkappachupa: pepoNote
[1:47:24] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: that makes sense
[1:47:37] grubols: ya pushback is more of a mage problem than your problem rn lol
[1:47:48] booddhi: its true, you get pushback anyway
[1:47:48] Ninemmglock: eles has a talent to get pushback immunity for 6 sec though, if they get critted once
[1:47:52] Sqwibbie: I DISAGREE
[1:47:54] Sqwibbie: for no reason
[1:47:54] mutez35: Aren't there slow attacking cats / raptors though?
[1:47:59] MrPoulpp: Do Broken Tooth is worth it ???
[1:47:59] magnumpe: you also got feign deaTH  if he ever gets the lava burst off
[1:48:04] Sqwibbie: Im just kidding lol
[1:48:06] Sqwibbie: sorry big z
[1:48:10] ObrezKnight: insta spells without cooldown is peak game play
[1:48:11] grubols: true😂
[1:48:16] grubols: besides the heal
[1:48:18] Hamsandwich37: @Sqwibbie You will be.
[1:48:21] Yormanqt: yeah makes sense, realy in sod noboby its casting just instant mostly LUL
[1:48:24] Omgezzz: as priest is kinda important with pushback talent becuse of pennence
[1:48:33] wowalbi: @Yormanqt its soft retail basically
[1:48:41] mutez35: OHhhh gotcha.  I thought you were comparing serp with cat.  I had a work call came in half way
[1:48:49] melquiisedeque_: BBoomer
[1:49:07] chevyb: miss KEKW
[1:49:09] shykuar: cause hes on a horse ofc you miss
[1:49:57] irvinwow: i agree with you when pet doesnt have BW up, but when pet has BW up faster is 100% more dmg
[1:50:42] booddhi: actually baiting them to cast with less pushback is good so u can get more dmg in
[1:50:49] paronpung21: fresh cut g
[1:50:58] nitromethane_: what made broken tooth bis is that it ramps up frenzy extremly fast (people think its just pushback but its not)
[1:51:03] Zhilex: Sup Z, how's hunter compared to mage ?
[1:51:11] Jaxuslol: it cant be slowed
[1:51:12] wyrmboi: it is not more dmg
[1:51:17] laxen567: The attack speed is divided in to two times, the swing time and the cooldown before it resets. It was like this in wc3 and different units had different times
[1:51:27] letsgetgoingyo: its the same dps if uptime is the same chat
[1:51:36] letsgetgoingyo: as soon as uptime is intermitent, slow harder hits is more damage
[1:51:40] irvinwow: frenzy goes up faster and crit chance change has less variance
[1:51:42] cicz: same bro, never touched hunters in all of wow history, but they are banging LUL
[1:52:02] magnumpe: i find hunter so different from other classes and i enjoy it even when they say mm is shit , as i love mm
[1:52:10] Duckduckgoose38: Gearing is fun :D

[2:33:11] OneTrueBlazerker: Avoidance is 21.8% it says so

[5:27:50] grimpo_dota: scarlet chestpiece +19 stam
[5:27:54] ArkoM8: MufasaPls
[5:28:23] booddhi: 2 armor per agi
[5:28:29] radassbadass69: agi gives armor but very little iirc
[5:28:41] radassbadass69: herod looks cooler tho
[5:28:46] Simpotta: youre hunter is naked you need to do gnomer my little man
[5:28:49] Markoes045: not bis looks tho
[5:28:49] iamveddi: alsi good hanfs
[5:28:51] Simpotta: your*
[5:28:56] TheGamingBoar: cath gloves aint bad

[5:29:19] Duleriumm: from ironspike rare
[5:29:19] radassbadass69: i think they mean the boe scarlet chest
[5:29:20] Markoes045: chest is BOE?
[5:29:24] DinkytheDoodle: Scarlet chestguard?
[5:29:31] aSteamedTomato: no, scarlet
[5:29:33] TheGamingBoar: Scarlet chest
[5:29:33] Markoes045: right bottom
[5:29:53] radassbadass69: more stam but no agi
[5:29:58] booddhi: go full stam + str melee hunter
[5:30:16] ExSpurtMEMES: its pretty close
[5:30:22] aSteamedTomato: agility is way better
[5:30:26] booddhi: but the stam mail gear has more str
[5:30:26] vbx93: agi is always better
[5:30:27] koda_42: @Ziqoftw also the rare is a 1 in 3 spawn causes there is 3 different rares in GY
[5:30:31] Simpotta: attack power is good
[5:30:35] Zenlyn: doesnt agi give u like 50% of the stat in armor too
[5:30:36] SeusV: agi gives 2 ap
[5:30:42] Simpotta: you need the sm gloves
[5:30:43] aSteamedTomato: you're surv-specced so you get more melee ap from agi than from str
[5:30:47] spacecowboyr: @SeusV for ranged, it's 1ap for melee
[5:30:49] vbx93: agi gives like 2.25% ap cuz of talent and the way hunter works
[5:30:52] aSteamedTomato: when doing PvP
[5:30:53] spacecowboyr: melee and str both give 1ap for hunters
[5:30:58] zeroji: agi and str both give 1 Melee AP on hunter, strength is just inferior to agi as it doesnt give RAP, which is what our pet scales with if you run one
[5:31:09] SNIFFFA: agi is so much better, meele or range. also pet does scale form agi
[5:31:10] aSteamedTomato: agi also gives crit
[5:31:19] rodavlasilad: agi gives dogshit crit for hunters
[5:31:21] ExSpurtMEMES: yes its both
[5:31:25] greta1500: Get broken alliance chest 23 agi
[5:31:30] Sephy11: agi = 1 melee ap
[5:31:32] SeusV: its gives everything str gives but armor and crit and dodge as well
[5:31:33] ExSpurtMEMES: RFD
[5:31:37] aSteamedTomato: agi is 1 mAP, 2 rAP, 0.03% crit, 2 armor, 0.06% dodge ish?
[5:31:46] Markoes045: @zeroji this
[5:31:55] Zenlyn: 1 agi = 2 armor? wtf
[5:31:56] Zenlyn: :O
[5:32:01] aSteamedTomato: you also get 15% extra agi if you're deep suv
[5:32:01] zeroji: if you are just going for glutton shoulders you can just solo him with mend pet, need to skip like 3 packs with feign
[5:32:08] Azkafan: whats good z i met stars in og with his tidal so i decided to do GY run for neck first run spawn first kill neck so i come to share some good rng
[5:32:09] zeroji: like just viper+mendpet and let pet kill him
[5:32:14] Azkafan: u need the chest in rfd?
[5:32:40] zeroji: BT WS Wolf, had to drop 2.0 for ws for gnomer
[5:32:48] vbx93: its super eaqsy and fast though
[5:33:00] zeroji: longtooth runner in feralas has max bite, claw rank is tanaris scorpids
[5:33:01] vbx93: u already were at the spot for dah/prowl in badlands
[5:33:09] aSteamedTomato: no, WS remains king
[5:33:11] juice42069: wyvern?
[5:33:15] M1shox_: gorila
[5:33:35] aSteamedTomato: it's rare
[5:33:36] zeroji: nah, ws is best for that, you can have 2.0 and 1.0 cats, I just use wolf for solos specifically
[5:33:46] aSteamedTomato: and a collector item as well as a decent piece of gear for some
[5:33:48] SamuraiWillZ916: its like a 1% drop
[5:34:02] SamuraiWillZ916: was cheaper when everyone was leveling
[5:34:04] lil__dolo: zeroji is it true the wolf buff only works on white attacks?
[5:34:09] zeroji: yes
[5:34:17] lil__dolo: sadge
[5:34:18] saund: is it just me or does the standard undead party frame look like XqC LuL @Ziqoftw
[5:34:36] zeroji: 0 21 10
[5:34:55] aSteamedTomato: entrapment + scatter?
[5:35:00] artform_: COCK YEP TAIL
[5:35:27] zeroji: going without intim or scatter will be questionable for duels at least
[5:35:36] pbj_time: so then if a warrior touches you, you die instantly
[5:35:37] pbj_time: perfect
[5:35:39] zeroji: with the new pvp trinket + how easy it is to skull trap launcher traps
[5:35:41] r3muz: @zeroji ziqoGasm
[5:35:41] SNIFFFA: @zeroji  could you send a talent tree with the 21/10 tree?
[5:36:11] pbj_time: overpower
[5:36:13] Onko22: but avoidance does not help vs casters?
[5:36:19] aSteamedTomato: @Ziqoftw , I think you should join the Tank Copium thread on the melee hunter discord

[5:40:01] welioos: never go full brick
[5:40:03] zeroji: no no enchants on neck or rings in classic
[5:40:12] zeroji: I mean full brick is only thing we have with the new pvp trinket
[5:40:16] Kriehp: @Zenlyn there isnt any enchants on rings in classic
[5:40:22] zeroji: we cant trap reset anymore, gotta kill them before our hp runs out
[5:40:28] Zenlyn: ahh my bad @Kriehp

[7:05:11] OptimusPrimePleb: group of 5 can do it, just need 1 hunter to kite dragon to kargath for the npcs to tank and the rest just clear mobs on the way for the hunter
[7:05:18] Curtsy: @HolyToucHHH In regards to asking "how is this content supposed to last until spring" it's a pretty normal thing to say
[7:05:33] Curtsy: @HolyToucHHH Of course if you're terminally online and do nothing else but play this game you're going to run out of shit to do
